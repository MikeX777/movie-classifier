1
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,684
I don't know why.
I've always been big on happy endings.

2
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,812
To me, the most romantic,
beautiful love storles...

3
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,314
were the ones where
two people meet, fall in love...

4
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:31,401
then 50, 60 years later
one of them dies.

5
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:33,945
A few days after,
the other one dies...

6
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:37,365
because they just can't live
without each other.

7
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:41,453
Not that that's such a happy ending.
You got two dead people.

8
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:45,498
That's how I thought things would be
for Katie and me.

9
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:49,544
Not that we'd be dead,
but that we would be together forever.

10
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,759
Now, High/Low.
Who wants to go first? Erin?

11
00:02:56,468 --> 00:03:00,347
Okay, my high today is that I sat
next to Austin Butler at lunch.

12
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,350
- Nice.
- He has the three-legged dog?

13
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,103
Joel has the three-legged dog.
Austin has the snoring turtle.

14
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,772
And your low?

15
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,149
- Camp.
- What about camp?

16
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:12,734
I don't know.

17
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,236
You had such a good time last year.

18
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,280
- I know.
- What is it?

19
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,784
Are you afraid you'll lose touch
with Austin?

20
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:24,496
- I don't know.
- You can write to each other.

21
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,749
You can put X's and O's on there.
Guys love that, right?

22
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,626
Can't get enough of it.

23
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,503
Honey, you'll have a great time.

24
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:34,005
What about you?
What was your high today?

25
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:36,508
Gary Ellis' mom bought a new juicer...

26
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:39,719
and I went to his house
and drank a chicken.

27
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,930
And your low?

28
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,390
I don't have a low.

29
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,266
You gotta have a low.

30
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:48,395
I've been racking my brain.
I do not have a low.

31
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:51,523
We'll enter the chicken smoothie
in the high and low category.

32
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:53,400
How about you, Mama?

33
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,237
I know. It's your anniversary.
What are you guys doing tomorrow?

34
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:01,533
- I'm taking her to a romantic dinner...
- Dad's taking me dancing.

35
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,410
and possibly some dancing.

36
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,286
But you' re right.
That is our high.

37
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:07,789
I'd love to stick around
for your low...

38
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,666
but Dodgers are playing Giants. 

39
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,917
Go.

40
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,877
- Can I go too?
- Go.

41
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,890
I really don't care what we do
tomorrow night.

42
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,435
Even if we' re
at different restaurants.

43
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:32,689
Just as long as the kids see us leaving
together and coming home together.

44
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:41,197
On our first anniversary,
I gave Ben a plastic spoon.

45
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:44,701
You know, the takeout kind
from a Chinese restaurant?

46
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,578
It was the one we had used...

47
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:50,331
when we shared our first bowl
of won ton soup in the park.

48
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,208
He was afraid he'd lost it...

49
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,711
and I remember how
his face lit up...

50
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:58,214
when he opened the jewelry box
I had wrapped it in.

51
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:02,344
I keep asking myself:

52
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,347
"When is that moment in a marriage...

53
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:08,141
when a spoon becomes just a spoon?"

54
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,828
When I met Katie,
I wrote on a comedy show...

55
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,539
and she had been hired as a temp.

56
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:36,169
I don 't know. xt's hard to explain.
There was an instant connection...

57
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,464
this simpatico.
I felt like she just got me.

58
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:43,385
And there is no greater feeling
in this world than to feel gotten.

59
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,657
The loudest silences are the ones...

60
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,785
filled with everything
that's been said...

61
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,246
said wrong, said 300 times.

62
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:55,165
You' re not hearing me.

63
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,042
You' re so goddamn critical!

64
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:59,544
It's hard with two kids.
I don't need a third.

65
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:03,131
You' re perfect, and I've done
nothing right in!5 years!

66
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,549
You' re not listening!

67
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,800
You can't let go of anything!

68
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,635
You never listen!

69
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,554
You hold on to everything!

70
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,431
Why should you be responsible
for anything?!

71
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,933
You' re critical of every
fucking thing!

72
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,810
I take care of everything here.

73
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,062
- Fine!
- Fine!

74
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,772
- Fine!
- Fine!

75
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:23,360
Until fighting becomes the condition
rather than the exception.

76
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:27,697
And suddenly, it turns into
the language of the relationship...

77
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:31,576
and your only option is
a silent retreat to neutral corners.

78
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,794
- Okay, are you a person?
- Yes.

79
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,128
Are you a man?

80
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,005
- That's debatable.
- Debatable?

81
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,508
- Do you have a mustache?
- A thick one.

82
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,468
- Aunt Rose.
- Right.

83
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,887
Good old Aunt "5:00 Shadow" Rose.

84
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:54,182
God, it's almost 9.
We' re gonna miss the camp bus.

85
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,435
Now, that is what I call
a mobile home.

86
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,646
Can you get around it?
It's 5 to 9!

87
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,774
- They must change their zip code a lot.
- It happens as we speak.

88
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,776
Look. 91604. 91604.

89
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,320
91605!

90
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:10,281
- Pass it.
- Their mailman must go crazy.

91
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,158
The kids will miss their bus.

92
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,870
Up on the second floor!
Somebody's about to use the bathroom!

93
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,164
We' re in the line of fire!

94
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:21,209
Would you just pass
the goddamn house?!

95
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,594
Look, the house is making a right.

96
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:37,183
When I was in college,
we had to write a term paper.

97
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,520
It was for some philosophy course
I was taking...

98
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,440
on any book we considered...

99
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,193
to be the one that best depicted
how we viewed the world.

100
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,947
I remember some people picking books
by the great thinkers...

101
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:54,576
like Kierkegaard and Plato.
Some kids chose the Bible.

102
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,455
I did my paper on
Harold and the Purple Crayon.

103
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,583
It's a small book
about a little boy...

104
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,711
who draws the world
the way he wants it to be...

105
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,588
with his magic crayon.

106
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:09,341
And I just loved that book because...

107
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:13,303
it was about everything
that I wasn't.

108
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,849
You wanna write crossword puzzles?

109
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,393
That's a job somebody wants to do?

110
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,355
And you'd get paid to do this?

111
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,982
So you know stuff like
Ra is the sun god.

112
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:29,819
And the symbol for radium
and the abbreviation for regular army.

113
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,864
Should I be impressed or terrified?

114
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,741
I find it soothing and reassuring...

115
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,869
because you know
there are always answers.

116
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:40,997
Yeah, but not to the really
big questions like:

117
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,500
"Does God exist?"
"What is the meaning of life?"

118
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,002
"Why does my pee smell funny
when I eat asparagus?"

119
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,380
Aspartic acid, hence the name.

120
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,009
And this soothes you?

121
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,263
Yes, since you'll never find
the answers to the big questions...

122
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:01,142
there's a comfort in finding
the answers to the little ones.

123
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:04,145
When you finish, there's this...

124
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,648
wonderful sense
of closure knowing...

125
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:10,235
that that little world
on that half-page is complete.

126
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,577
You left yourself wide open.

127
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,706
Come to Papa!

128
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,668
But the problem in a marriage is...

129
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:31,047
if one person is always Harold,
drawing the world the way they want...

130
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,926
the other person has no choice
but to draw it the way it is.

131
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,180
Which is why they never wrote a book
about Harold's wife.

132
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,766
- They' re leaving!
- They' re not!

133
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,563
Grab your bags!

134
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,898
Wait! Wait!

135
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,067
Hold it!

136
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,902
Two more coming!

137
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,031
- Thank you, Marty.
- No problem.

138
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,743
I love you.
Have a great time.

139
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:02,328
- All right, kid.
- Bye, Dad.

140
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,831
- Take your sister's bag.
- Have a great time.

141
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,332
Love you.

142
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,800
- I love you.
- I love you.

143
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,437
If you need me for anything,
I'll be at the Oceana.

144
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,650
Anything comes up with the kids,
give me a call.

145
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,193
Of course.

146
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,242
Isn't this the moment
where one of us says:

147
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,911
"This is ridiculous.
We love each other.

148
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:28,456
All couples go through this.
Let's give it another try"?

149
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:54,232
My ass was on television this morning.

150
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,484
What are you telling us?

151
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,361
I'm telling you
my ass was on TV.

152
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,864
That's right. That was that special.

153
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:03,992
"The Kennedy Center Salutes
50 Years of Stan's Ass".

154
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:07,746
I went to the doctor, he took a tube
with a little camera on it...

155
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:11,499
stuck it up my ass and we
watched it on a monitor in his office.

156
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,002
- You had a sigmoidoscopy.
- Exactly.

157
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:16,504
That's different
than your ass being on TV.

158
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,381
- How?
- First of all...

159
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,258
a network can't cancel your ass.

160
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:22,093
Point well taken.

161
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,637
What demographics
do you hope to knock down...

162
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,140
with that big crack
winking at you?

163
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,769
We' re in public. Can we
elevate the level of conversation?

164
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:32,145
- Fine with me.
- Good.

165
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:35,148
I jerked off to your secretary.
Do you mind?

166
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,150
- Why should I mind?
- I don't know.

167
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,652
I wanna forge ahead
with a clear conscience.

168
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,904
Pound away.

169
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:42,781
You' re a good friend.

170
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:47,077
Larry wanted to have sex last night.
He even gave me the 30-second massage.

171
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,081
You mean the "I really care
that you had a bad day" back rub...

172
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,416
that stops just before you relax...

173
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,544
then quickly heads south
towards the promised land?

174
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,421
So did you make love?

175
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:00,924
- I was too tired.
- How'd you get out of it?

176
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:03,426
I pretended to fall asleep
during the massage.

177
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,303
I did that heavy breathing thing.

178
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:07,180
So he thinks you' re in deep REM?

179
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,308
But it backfired,
because when I really fell asleep...

180
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:14,062
the baby started crying,
then Larry pretended he was asleep.

181
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:17,816
Fool! If he had just gotten up
with the baby, you would've...

182
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:21,569
opened the gates and welcomed
the troops home for Christmas.

183
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,321
In a heartbeat.

184
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,323
What's up with you and Charlene?

185
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,826
Oh, we had a great night last night.

186
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:30,328
And you still claim
you' re not cheating?

187
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:32,831
I maintain that
with every fiber of my being.

188
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:34,082
On-line sex isn't cheating.

189
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:35,959
How do you figure?

190
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:39,087
It's 3 a.m., your wife and kids
are sleeping upstairs...

191
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:42,215
and you' re downstairs
fucking some bimbo in cyberspace.

192
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:45,468
First of all, we' re not fucking.
We' re typing.

193
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:48,471
Second, and this is me
taking umbrage...

194
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,974
Charlene is not some bimbo.

195
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:53,476
She's a stockbroker named Ralph...

196
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,979
pretending to be some bimbo
named Charlene.

197
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:58,481
Why piss on something so beautiful?

198
00:14:58,481 --> 00:14:59,733
What'd I say?

199
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:00,984
It's not an affair.

200
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:04,112
Teresa never had sex with him.
They just kissed.

201
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:06,781
- A kiss is an affair.
- You think so?

202
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,491
Absolutely.

203
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:12,245
Once you establish anything
truly intimate with another person...

204
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,122
even talking...

205
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:17,709
it affects the person you' re
the most intimate with.

206
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:21,629
But Teresa could fuck her husband,
she just couldn't kiss him.

207
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,506
I mean, really kiss him.

208
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:24,758
It's not so crazy.

209
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:27,886
Sometimes I' m so angry at Stan,
I could fuck him...

210
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:29,763
but I don't want
that cow tongue near me.

211
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:32,807
A kiss can be so much more
intimate than sex.

212
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:35,393
Why is that?

213
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:38,521
Because fucking means,
"Yeah, I love you". But a kiss....

214
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,857
A kiss means, "I like you".

215
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,443
That's so right.

216
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:48,031
I haven't made out, I mean,
really made out with Larry for years.

217
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,034
Doesn't that make you sad?

218
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:52,619
Not really.

219
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:54,829
Why?

220
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,082
I don't know.

221
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,418
Because it's inevitable.
It's the wear and tear of the job.

222
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,921
The diapers, the tantrums,
the homework.

223
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:05,757
The kingdom, species,
your mom, his mom.

224
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:09,177
Suddenly, all you' re aware of is
the wet towels on the floor...

225
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:12,305
he hogs the remote and
he scratches his back with a fork.

226
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:16,059
And you come face to face with
the truth that it's impossible...

227
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:19,187
to kiss a person who leaves
the new roll of toilet paper...

228
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,690
on top of the empty cardboard roll!

229
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:25,318
God forbid he takes the two seconds
to actually replace it!

230
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:27,404
Does he not see it?!

231
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:32,283
I'm telling you, marriage is
the Jack Kevorkian of romance.

232
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,996
Oh, God!

233
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,127
Jesus! Shit!

234
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:44,254
- He hit me!
- I didn't!

235
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:46,756
I was leaving the room,
she stood in my way.

236
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:49,509
- He did it on purpose.
- Guys, hold on!

237
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,346
Ben? What?!

238
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:57,767
Katie, you won't believe
what I' m standing in front of.

239
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,520
They' re tearing down
our old apartment.

240
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,771
- What?
- See?!

241
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,648
Josh, did you hit her?

242
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,400
She started it!

243
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:08,028
I told her never to come in my room
without asking.

244
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:09,904
It's heading for Mrs. Gutierrez's.

245
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,781
There goes her window!

246
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,658
You borrowed her Discman
without asking?!

247
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:16,077
Yeah, but she was done with it.

248
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:18,997
She hasn't used the Discman
in two days!

249
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:23,668
Just hit Jack Roikman's place.
Remember his patriotic orgasms?

250
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:27,255
"God bless America! God bless America!
Land that I love!"

251
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:29,299
Can't you let him use yours?

252
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:31,176
No! He never lets me use it!

253
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:33,470
Ben, I can't talk right now.

254
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:38,308
This is where you and I started.
This is where we became an "us".

255
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:42,437
Just hit where we used to
measure the kids' heights.

256
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:46,191
Ben, I... Josh, you shouldn't have
hit your sister. No TV for a week.

257
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:48,068
You' re so unfair!

258
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:50,153
Wait until I tell Dad!

259
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,365
Jesus Christ! I gotta go!
Are you okay?

260
00:17:57,452 --> 00:17:59,037
Goddamn it!

261
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,831
Fantasizing isn't cheating?

262
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,292
Oh, please! Who is getting hurt?

263
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:08,088
Yesterday, I met this
stunning blond woman...

264
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:10,590
at the Beverly Center food court.

265
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,468
She had a little ring
in the bellybutton.

266
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:14,969
But you know what?

267
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:18,515
I forgave her because
it wasn't in her eyebrow or tongue.

268
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,600
Beautiful. We start chatting...

269
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,728
and we strike up a conversation,
waiting for our turkey.

270
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:26,856
I'm telling you,
she's smiling, I' m smiling...

271
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:29,359
and just that
30-second encounter...

272
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:33,113
will do wonders for me when
I'm shaking hands with the sheriff.

273
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:35,615
I know exactly what
you' re talking about.

274
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,118
- Am I wrong?
- No, you' re right!

275
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:41,246
The other day, I told a joke
to this intriguing woman...

276
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:43,123
that I met at the cleaners.

277
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:46,251
If this were the '30s,
she'd be a Communist...

278
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:48,128
or at least
a Communist sympathizer.

279
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:51,589
But the point is, the way
she laughed at that joke...

280
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:55,010
reminded me of how Rachel
used to laugh at my jokes.

281
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,886
You gonna follow up?

282
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,138
I could never do that.

283
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:02,308
I think the Ten Commandments were
probably a lot easier to stick to...

284
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:05,020
when you dropped dead at 35.

285
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,896
I mean, we...
They should be amended.

286
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:09,399
A little amendment,
like the Constitution.

287
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:12,902
"Thou shalt not covet
thy neighbor's house, wife or ass.

288
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:17,532
But if you have to covet
your neighbor's wife's ass...

289
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:20,035
don't do it
in thy neighbor's house".

290
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:23,788
A simple amendment, two-thirds
majority, slide through both Houses.

291
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:27,792
Seriously, name me one guy you know
who's never cheated on his wife.

292
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:30,045
I wasn't cheating!

293
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:33,798
I walk into your office,
and I hear you telling some Sara...

294
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:37,677
intimate details about our
relationship, about our problems.

295
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:42,349
Obviously there's something going on
between you and her.

296
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:45,685
Nothing is going on between us!
We were just talking!

297
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,562
About us?! About our life?!

298
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:49,606
We were just talking!

299
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:52,567
That's not talking!
That's a relationship!

300
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:55,695
Why didn't you tell me about her
if there's nothing to hide?

301
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,198
I just needed somebody to talk to!

302
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:00,867
Bullshit! Why didn't you talk to me?!

303
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:04,371
Mommy, I need a drink of water!

304
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:06,331
I'll be right there!

305
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:08,208
You wanna know why
I don't talk to you?

306
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:12,295
You treat me like I' m a big pain
in the ass that gets in the way...

307
00:20:12,587 --> 00:20:15,715
of what otherwise would be
a normal, organized life!

308
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:19,427
Have you ever thought that
everything isn't always about you?

309
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:24,140
Maybe I' m tired! Maybe I' m dealing
with 5000 things all day Iong!

310
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:27,602
Maybe every need you have
doesn't have to be met...

311
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:30,730
at the exact moment
you need it to be met!

312
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,858
God, we have actual kids here, Ben.

313
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,985
I am not a third child!

314
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:39,489
I am not talking about having
each of my needs met!

315
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:41,366
I'm talking about a connection!

316
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:45,120
A look! Something that says
that we' re on the same side here!

317
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:48,248
Why don't you talk
to your girlfriend?

318
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:51,584
I'm sure she can help us
get back on the same side.

319
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:03,304
To have a happy marriage is to accept
the chasm between men and women.

320
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:04,556
Which is?

321
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:06,891
He can mend a fight with sex.

322
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:09,561
She can't have sex
until the fight's resolved.

323
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:10,812
Why is that?

324
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:13,940
It's the difference between
the penis and the vagina.

325
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:17,318
A penis is a thruster,
a battering ram, if you will.

326
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:20,822
Even if it's mad, it can ram.
Sometimes it even helps.

327
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:23,950
It's the "mad-ram principle".
However, the vagina....

328
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,535
The vagina!

329
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:30,040
The vagina has to be relaxed
in order to open and receive.

330
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,960
It can't be a gracious hostess
in a state of anger.

331
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,463
That goes for blowjobs
and kissing too.

332
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:40,633
Every female point of entry needs
to know that the penis is coming...

333
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:43,178
in peace.

334
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:45,847
- Do you have Sweet' N Low?
- Is Equal okay?

335
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:47,349
Whatever.

336
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:55,231
I've always felt no matter what
we were going through...

337
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,734
no matter how painful things got...

338
00:21:57,734 --> 00:22:00,236
if our feet found each other
under the blankets...

339
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:02,113
even just the slightest
connection...

340
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:05,241
it'd tell us we 'd entered
the demilitarized zone...

341
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:08,995
that we were gonna be okay,
that we were still an "us".

342
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:14,376
There are some hurts that you
never completely get over.

343
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:18,797
And you think that time will diminish
their presence...

344
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:22,133
and to a degree it does...

345
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:25,178
but it still hurts,
because, well...

346
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:28,348
hurt hurts.

347
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:34,688
If you lose your room key...

348
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:36,564
contact the front desk.

349
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:40,151
And if you 've got valuables,
keep them in the hotel safe.

350
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:41,569
It's complimentary.

351
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:44,698
For family dining,
how about a pizza poolside...

352
00:22:44,698 --> 00:22:47,200
from our Wolfgang Puck Cafe?

353
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,328
Then it's a quick walk to
the Santa Monica Pier and beach.

354
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:54,082
When the kids are acting up,
the waves will set them straight.

355
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:12,267
The Patriot is proof positive...

356
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:14,728
that missile defense works.

357
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:17,814
As we 've been taught
by Saddam Hussein....

358
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:21,985
Something about how that man says
"Saddam" makes me want you even more.

359
00:23:34,748 --> 00:23:36,374
Oh, my God!

360
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:38,501
- The tooth fairy.
- Where?

361
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:41,921
Josh's tooth. We forgot to put
money under his pillow.

362
00:23:42,255 --> 00:23:45,383
Josh is asleep. I' m sure
this can wait a few minutes.

363
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:48,011
No, no, baby, we might forget later.

364
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:52,515
Who goes?

365
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:54,768
Rock, paper, scissors!

366
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:56,102
Shit!

367
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:03,026
Mr. President, I' m entrusting you
with my soon-to-be-naked wife.

368
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:05,904
Take care of her, the country.

369
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:07,280
My love to Barbara.

370
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,199
I'll be right back.

371
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:20,460
I'll be right back!

372
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:13,763
Everything that's important in
the world is in this bed right now.

373
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,935
I love you.

374
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:22,063
I love you.

375
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:57,557
Hi. You 've reached the home
of Jordan, Jordan, Jordan and Jordan.

376
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,893
Nary a Jordan is present now.

377
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:03,021
If you wanna leave a message
for Katie, Ben, Josh or Erin...

378
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:05,565
what better time than....

379
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:09,903
Hi, it's me.

380
00:26:09,903 --> 00:26:13,031
I'm just calling to see
how the kids are doing.

381
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:15,867
See if you got any post cards
from them.

382
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,079
Anything comes up,
you can give me a call.

383
00:26:20,538 --> 00:26:21,998
Bye-bye.

384
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:45,814
Listen, I just got your message.
I was in the shower when you called.

385
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,943
The kids seem to be doing really well.

386
00:26:49,943 --> 00:26:52,821
I just put the post cards
in an envelope.

387
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:55,573
You should be getting them tomorrow.

388
00:26:55,573 --> 00:26:56,950
Good.

389
00:26:59,327 --> 00:27:00,829
You okay?

390
00:27:01,204 --> 00:27:03,415
Yeah, I' m okay. You okay?

391
00:27:04,332 --> 00:27:06,126
Yeah, I' m okay.

392
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:14,384
Bye.

393
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:16,886
Bye.

394
00:27:58,178 --> 00:27:59,637
It's me.

395
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:05,685
How are you?

396
00:28:05,685 --> 00:28:08,104
I'm good. Yeah, really good.

397
00:28:08,188 --> 00:28:09,439
Good.

398
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:11,024
What's up?

399
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:14,110
What's up?

400
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:20,617
I was thinking about the upstairs
bathroom, and I wanted to remind you...

401
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,203
to schedule that guy
to recaulk the tub.

402
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:25,205
I've already done it.

403
00:28:27,582 --> 00:28:28,958
Well.

404
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:30,835
Good.

405
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:35,965
Then...

406
00:28:37,592 --> 00:28:38,843
bye.

407
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:40,136
Bye.

408
00:28:56,986 --> 00:29:01,282
I'm calling to see if you remember
the name of that tree surgeon we used.

409
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:03,243
Joey Bishop.

410
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:04,911
Yeah, but no.

411
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:08,248
- But it was one of those Rat Pack guys.
- Right.

412
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:09,958
Frank Sinatra?

413
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:11,793
Dean Martin?

414
00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:13,253
Sammy Davis Jr?

415
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:15,422
That's it! Joey Davis Jr.

416
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:18,883
Joey Davis Jr., the tree surgeon.

417
00:29:18,883 --> 00:29:22,012
I can still see the sign
on that blue truck of his.

418
00:29:22,012 --> 00:29:23,972
Right. Okay, thanks.

419
00:29:27,642 --> 00:29:28,893
Bye.

420
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:32,063
Listen, your shirts came back
from the cleaners.

421
00:29:34,524 --> 00:29:37,027
Cool. I'll come by and get them.

422
00:29:37,652 --> 00:29:39,529
I can drop them off.

423
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:42,615
It's fine. I'll be happy
to come and get them.

424
00:29:42,657 --> 00:29:44,868
What would be a good time?

425
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,411
I don't know....

426
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:49,539
Why don't you come over tomorrow?
I'll be home by 7.

427
00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:51,666
You can stay for dinner.

428
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:53,543
You sure?

429
00:29:53,918 --> 00:29:55,170
No.

430
00:29:57,672 --> 00:29:59,507
See you tomorrow.

431
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:13,308
You look like...

432
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:15,643
like you.

433
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:19,147
You too.

434
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:30,367
I guess I could stand on the porch
all night. I've seen the house.

435
00:32:30,825 --> 00:32:34,829
How many times have we said,
"We should use this porch more often"?

436
00:32:35,205 --> 00:32:38,124
Come in. My house is
literally your house.

437
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:40,502
Thank you.

438
00:32:44,589 --> 00:32:48,093
- There's my dry cleaning.
- Yeah, I left it out for you.

439
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:51,471
Good. I'll remember
to take it with me.

440
00:32:51,471 --> 00:32:54,516
Because I could put it
in the closet, but I...

441
00:32:55,225 --> 00:32:58,019
That is perfect
dry cleaning placement.

442
00:32:59,604 --> 00:33:02,482
- You want a drink?
- You want something...?

443
00:33:03,358 --> 00:33:05,110
Want some wine?

444
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,279
I think I remember where it is.

445
00:33:08,988 --> 00:33:12,033
- If memory serves, you like red wine.
- Right.

446
00:33:12,117 --> 00:33:14,619
Yeah, it's all coming back to me.

447
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:19,374
Wine is breathing a lot better
than I am.

448
00:33:24,629 --> 00:33:27,590
You'll never believe
what I did last night.

449
00:33:27,757 --> 00:33:30,635
I attempted to do
one of your crosswords.

450
00:33:33,388 --> 00:33:34,639
I have a question.

451
00:33:34,639 --> 00:33:37,392
What was 3 down?
Just couldn't get it.

452
00:33:37,767 --> 00:33:41,187
Four letters, "Feeling of
psychological discomfort".

453
00:33:41,521 --> 00:33:42,856
Blah.

454
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:45,358
Blah.

455
00:33:48,403 --> 00:33:49,654
Cheers.

456
00:33:49,654 --> 00:33:51,072
Cheers.

457
00:34:03,418 --> 00:34:04,669
Was this always here?

458
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:06,880
No, I bought it last week.

459
00:34:09,674 --> 00:34:12,719
Any other new appliances
I should know about?

460
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:16,556
Well, as long as we' re
spilling our guts here...

461
00:34:16,556 --> 00:34:19,309
I also got this new garlic press.

462
00:34:19,684 --> 00:34:23,438
The body's not even cold,
and she's out buying garlic presses.

463
00:34:35,325 --> 00:34:37,702
How do you think the kids are?

464
00:34:37,827 --> 00:34:40,330
From the cards,
it sounds like they' re good.

465
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:43,124
I think Erin misses us,
but she's okay.

466
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:45,460
Yeah. She seems okay.

467
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,212
You think she's okay?

468
00:34:47,212 --> 00:34:49,089
I think she's okay.

469
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:52,425
Because I think she senses
that we' re not okay...

470
00:34:52,842 --> 00:34:55,512
and Parents' Weekend is coming.

471
00:34:57,222 --> 00:34:59,683
We'll just have to give her...

472
00:34:59,724 --> 00:35:02,227
a lot of extra attention...

473
00:35:02,227 --> 00:35:04,521
and really love her up.

474
00:35:14,739 --> 00:35:15,990
Should we eat?

475
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,867
Yeah, I could eat.

476
00:35:21,871 --> 00:35:23,748
This is really good.

477
00:35:23,748 --> 00:35:25,166
Thanks.

478
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,629
High/Low?

479
00:35:30,005 --> 00:35:31,339
Sure.

480
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:33,425
Your high?

481
00:35:33,758 --> 00:35:35,260
Honestly?

482
00:35:36,261 --> 00:35:37,804
Right now.

483
00:35:39,389 --> 00:35:41,057
And your low?

484
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:45,729
Every minute of the last two weeks.

485
00:35:47,522 --> 00:35:49,232
How about you?

486
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:54,904
My high would have to be the Cuisinart,
because I wanted it ever so badly.

487
00:35:55,655 --> 00:35:57,323
And your low?

488
00:35:58,158 --> 00:36:01,995
The garlic press. It's not nearly
as handy as I thought it'd be.

489
00:36:02,537 --> 00:36:05,874
I lay myself open, and you mock me
with kitchenware.

490
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:09,419
All the while making me
more attractive to you.

491
00:36:11,296 --> 00:36:13,381
Is that your intention?

492
00:36:17,552 --> 00:36:19,262
I'm not sure.

493
00:36:22,557 --> 00:36:24,267
It's working.

494
00:36:51,961 --> 00:36:55,340
It looks like I haven't been
doing too much reading.

495
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,181
Okay, I' m ready. How about you?

496
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,976
- I...
- What?

497
00:37:07,602 --> 00:37:10,105
Come on. Remember
what Dr. Tischner said:

498
00:37:10,105 --> 00:37:13,400
"If you had it once,
you can always get it back".

499
00:37:13,858 --> 00:37:16,945
Was that Dr. Tischner
or was that Dr. Hopkins?

500
00:37:20,115 --> 00:37:21,991
The one with the sibilant "S".

501
00:37:21,991 --> 00:37:23,368
Right.

502
00:37:24,494 --> 00:37:26,871
Wrong. It was a lateral lisp.

503
00:37:26,996 --> 00:37:29,791
Sex is simply a symbolic expression...

504
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:33,253
of the emotional status
of a relationship.

505
00:37:33,253 --> 00:37:36,715
Sustained lack of sex is
symptomatic of disassociation.

506
00:37:38,883 --> 00:37:42,012
No, the one with the lateral lisp
was Dr. Rifkin.

507
00:37:42,012 --> 00:37:46,099
Dr. Hopkins was the one with the
Rorschach birthmark on his forehead.

508
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:50,145
It looked like California. How could
you pay attention to what he said?

509
00:37:50,145 --> 00:37:53,273
This cycle of closeness,
then estrangement...

510
00:37:53,273 --> 00:37:55,150
you've both told me about...

511
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:58,278
what instigates it?
First thing that comes to your mind.

512
00:37:58,278 --> 00:38:00,864
- Sacramento.
- Governor Gray Davis.

513
00:38:01,406 --> 00:38:05,243
My personal favorite was the Freudian
with the prostate problem.

514
00:38:07,037 --> 00:38:08,913
When two people go to bed...

515
00:38:08,913 --> 00:38:12,083
there are actually six people
in that bed.

516
00:38:13,293 --> 00:38:15,253
If you'll excuse me.

517
00:38:17,047 --> 00:38:19,758
Are we allowed to talk when he's gone?

518
00:38:20,175 --> 00:38:21,843
I don't know.

519
00:38:22,052 --> 00:38:23,928
What do you think?

520
00:38:23,928 --> 00:38:26,931
To be on the safe side,
maybe we better not.

521
00:38:33,938 --> 00:38:36,983
The six people in bed are
the two of you...

522
00:38:37,692 --> 00:38:40,487
and your parents
and your parents.

523
00:38:41,446 --> 00:38:43,490
Now, the key is....

524
00:38:44,574 --> 00:38:46,826
Will you excuse me, please?

525
00:38:49,954 --> 00:38:52,457
He charged us for the full session.

526
00:38:52,457 --> 00:38:54,876
The man was peeing on our time!

527
00:38:58,713 --> 00:39:01,216
All that therapy was
a waste of time and money.

528
00:39:01,216 --> 00:39:04,094
Where did all that therapy
really get us?

529
00:39:04,969 --> 00:39:06,846
It got us here,
laughing about it.

530
00:39:06,846 --> 00:39:10,141
- He's right.
- Once it's broken, it can't be fixed.

531
00:39:11,226 --> 00:39:13,728
- I don't know.
- The queen has spoken.

532
00:39:13,728 --> 00:39:16,856
- Maybe it's too soon.
- What are you talking about?

533
00:39:16,856 --> 00:39:21,194
The whole point of having a fight is
playing "hide the salami" afterwards.

534
00:39:21,861 --> 00:39:25,532
Let hard times bring you together.
Nobody said it'd be easy.

535
00:39:25,615 --> 00:39:29,327
Can't hard times bring us together?
Nobody said it'd be easy.

536
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:32,497
Like the Andrews Sisters.
After "Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy"...

537
00:39:32,497 --> 00:39:34,374
before "Don't Sit
Under the Apple Tree".

538
00:39:34,374 --> 00:39:36,251
Big career slump there.

539
00:39:36,251 --> 00:39:39,379
Like the Andrews Sisters before
"Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree".

540
00:39:39,379 --> 00:39:41,256
The Andrews Sisters?

541
00:39:41,256 --> 00:39:43,133
They didn't stop
because of a few flops.

542
00:39:43,133 --> 00:39:45,635
They hung in there.
The rest is history.

543
00:39:45,635 --> 00:39:48,054
Don 't sit under the apple tree

544
00:39:48,138 --> 00:39:51,266
Why are you bringing up
the Andrews Sisters now?

545
00:39:51,266 --> 00:39:53,768
- You' re singing!
- It's an example.

546
00:39:53,768 --> 00:39:56,271
They' re in trouble,
and you' re singing?

547
00:39:56,271 --> 00:39:59,858
Dot, put out once in a while.
Your face won't be so tight.

548
00:40:00,025 --> 00:40:01,276
Slut.

549
00:40:01,276 --> 00:40:05,488
I don't know what their career slump
has to do with our marital problems.

550
00:40:05,655 --> 00:40:07,532
What should we do?

551
00:40:07,532 --> 00:40:11,286
Make matters worse by dwelling
on every little thing all our lives?

552
00:40:11,286 --> 00:40:13,580
Is that what you think I do?

553
00:40:13,788 --> 00:40:16,291
- You' re a child.
- I just dwell on everything?

554
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:18,626
You' re a 72-year-old infant!

555
00:40:18,793 --> 00:40:22,547
There are real problems that we
haven't even begun to deal with.

556
00:40:22,547 --> 00:40:25,800
Don't you think I know that?
What happened to you?

557
00:40:26,301 --> 00:40:29,429
What happened to that fun girl
with the pith helmet?

558
00:40:29,429 --> 00:40:32,432
You don't think I ask myself
that every day?

559
00:40:32,557 --> 00:40:35,935
You beat her out of me!
There's no room here for her!

560
00:40:36,311 --> 00:40:37,562
You think it's all fun and games.

561
00:40:37,562 --> 00:40:40,899
So it's my fault you hang on
to every little thing!

562
00:40:41,316 --> 00:40:44,319
It's my fault you can't
let go of anything!

563
00:40:44,444 --> 00:40:47,405
It's my fault you turned
into your mother?!

564
00:40:47,572 --> 00:40:49,074
Fuck you!

565
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:39,040
- I still think that there's a chance...
- Ben, you love who we were.

566
00:41:39,499 --> 00:41:42,544
You couldn't possibly love
what we've become.

567
00:41:43,878 --> 00:41:46,673
I think I spotted us
at dinner tonight.

568
00:41:48,258 --> 00:41:50,760
We can't stay together
just because we...

569
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,888
get a glimpse of "us"
every once in a while.

570
00:41:53,888 --> 00:41:56,391
It was less than! 5 minutes ago.

571
00:41:58,268 --> 00:42:01,396
All we proved is, if we' re apart
for weeks at a time...

572
00:42:01,396 --> 00:42:04,983
we might get through a dinner.
That's not a marriage.

573
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,323
It's over.

574
00:42:50,278 --> 00:42:51,529
A book about your grandmother?

575
00:42:51,529 --> 00:42:54,032
Yeah. She was an extraordinary woman.

576
00:42:54,032 --> 00:42:57,035
I'm sure she was.
Did she fuck a President?

577
00:42:57,786 --> 00:43:00,121
No. Did she discover uranium?

578
00:43:00,914 --> 00:43:03,625
A cure for cancer?
Nothing like that?

579
00:43:04,668 --> 00:43:07,754
Why would anybody wanna read
a book about her?

580
00:43:07,796 --> 00:43:11,466
She was 4' 9". She emigrated
from Europe as a little girl.

581
00:43:11,549 --> 00:43:15,762
She worked in a sweatshop making
buttonholes! 4 hours a day and yet...

582
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:19,683
raised five kids and stayed married
to the same man for 57 years.

583
00:43:19,683 --> 00:43:23,103
Dave, this will be the greatest
love story ever told.

584
00:43:24,688 --> 00:43:27,816
Let me explain something to you.
Not as your agent.

585
00:43:27,816 --> 00:43:29,818
This is as a friend.

586
00:43:34,072 --> 00:43:35,615
Come here.

587
00:43:36,574 --> 00:43:38,451
You see all these people?

588
00:43:38,451 --> 00:43:41,579
They' re getting into buildings.
They' re driving cars.

589
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:44,708
They' re crossing the street.
They' re walking around.

590
00:43:44,708 --> 00:43:47,210
Every single one of these people...

591
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:49,713
is going to die someday...

592
00:43:49,713 --> 00:43:51,923
and they all know it.

593
00:43:52,215 --> 00:43:54,050
Which is why...

594
00:43:54,092 --> 00:43:57,846
they regard the time they have
on this planet as precious.

595
00:43:57,846 --> 00:44:00,348
There are things that take up
that time...

596
00:44:00,348 --> 00:44:03,935
even if they don't enjoy it.
They have to go to work.

597
00:44:04,102 --> 00:44:06,604
They have to get dressed,
wait in lines...

598
00:44:06,604 --> 00:44:09,065
clean yards, get batteries.

599
00:44:09,107 --> 00:44:12,235
They visit the eye doctor.
They' re doing all these things.

600
00:44:12,235 --> 00:44:15,989
Now, add that to the time they spend
sleeping and eating...

601
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,868
and washing up and voting...

602
00:44:20,368 --> 00:44:24,122
and buying gifts for people
they don't like, and you see...

603
00:44:24,122 --> 00:44:28,126
why they' re so choosy about
how they spend their leisure time.

604
00:44:28,501 --> 00:44:31,629
You can understand why
unless she went down on somebody...

605
00:44:31,629 --> 00:44:35,383
really interesting, they won't
waste their valuable time...

606
00:44:35,383 --> 00:44:38,720
reading a book about
your fucking grandmother!

607
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:44,768
So if I read you right,
you don't like the idea.

608
00:44:44,768 --> 00:44:46,478
It's not that.

609
00:44:56,654 --> 00:45:00,575
You know, I  find the Ariana
much more fragrant than the Raphaela.

610
00:45:02,285 --> 00:45:04,162
I'll keep that in mind.

611
00:45:04,162 --> 00:45:06,247
- How you doing?
- Fine.

612
00:45:06,664 --> 00:45:10,293
I never got a chance to thank you
for holding the camp bus.

613
00:45:10,418 --> 00:45:13,380
Anytime you need a bus held,
I am your guy.

614
00:45:13,546 --> 00:45:16,675
- Erin's teeth are looking good.
- Thanks to you.

615
00:45:16,675 --> 00:45:19,177
I hope she remembers to wear
her retainer.

616
00:45:19,177 --> 00:45:21,054
You know how kids are at camp.

617
00:45:21,054 --> 00:45:24,974
The minute my Kevin gets off that bus,
it's "Goodbye, biteplate".

618
00:45:25,433 --> 00:45:27,227
Is that for you?

619
00:45:28,561 --> 00:45:32,232
When Deirdre and I divorced,
I decided to Iearn how to cook.

620
00:45:32,315 --> 00:45:34,776
The Wok-y World of Thai Cooking?

621
00:45:34,818 --> 00:45:36,069
I'm branching out.

622
00:45:36,069 --> 00:45:39,155
I'm taking a Thai cooking course
this summer.

623
00:45:39,197 --> 00:45:42,617
Really? I've always been interested
in Asian cooking.

624
00:45:42,951 --> 00:45:44,202
Really?

625
00:45:44,202 --> 00:45:46,246
Why don't you join me?

626
00:45:48,581 --> 00:45:50,458
When I think about it...

627
00:45:50,458 --> 00:45:52,961
over the years there were
less and less moments...

628
00:45:52,961 --> 00:45:54,838
in the course of the day...

629
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:57,966
when Ben and I actually made
real eye contact.

630
00:45:57,966 --> 00:46:00,844
You are not gonna believe
what happened.

631
00:46:01,094 --> 00:46:03,388
- What?
- He's almost asleep.

632
00:46:04,848 --> 00:46:07,267
Maybe it was the stuff of life.

633
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:09,728
Who 's taking Erin to school?

634
00:46:09,853 --> 00:46:12,981
Who will pick up Josh
from his clarinet lessons?

635
00:46:12,981 --> 00:46:16,109
After a while, there was
a disturbing comfort...

636
00:46:16,109 --> 00:46:17,986
in not having to deal
with each other...

637
00:46:17,986 --> 00:46:21,656
because somehow you just
get used to the disconnection.

638
00:46:22,991 --> 00:46:27,037
Even at night, when we could finally
come together, we faced forward.

639
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:30,498
Yeah, we were tired,
but I think we were afraid...

640
00:46:30,498 --> 00:46:34,210
that if we faced each other,
there 'd be nothing there.

641
00:46:34,252 --> 00:46:36,755
We' re learning Mee Krob next week.

642
00:46:36,755 --> 00:46:38,256
Mee Krob.

643
00:46:39,257 --> 00:46:41,134
I'll let you know.

644
00:46:44,888 --> 00:46:47,307
I'll call you. Oh, you call me.

645
00:46:52,604 --> 00:46:55,732
When we drove to the camp
for Parents ' Weekend...

646
00:46:55,732 --> 00:46:58,234
l was scared to face the kids.

647
00:46:58,234 --> 00:47:02,530
You 'd talk about it with a best friend.
But Katie had been my best friend.

648
00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:07,118
Now I didn 't know what we were,
except Josh and Erin 's parents.

649
00:47:33,895 --> 00:47:35,230
What?

650
00:47:37,023 --> 00:47:38,525
Nothing.

651
00:47:41,403 --> 00:47:43,071
is nothing?

652
00:47:44,531 --> 00:47:46,866
This is not going to be easy.

653
00:47:47,659 --> 00:47:51,079
The kids do not need to be burdened
with our problems.

654
00:47:51,413 --> 00:47:53,289
They have half a summer left.

655
00:47:53,289 --> 00:47:56,418
Like my plan was to burden
the kids with our problems.

656
00:47:56,418 --> 00:47:59,713
Jesus Christ, will you give me
some fucking credit?

657
00:48:06,428 --> 00:48:08,096
I missed you.

658
00:48:08,304 --> 00:48:10,181
I missed you so much.

659
00:48:10,181 --> 00:48:12,392
I missed you both so much.

660
00:48:15,186 --> 00:48:17,063
Dad, pull yourself together.

661
00:48:17,063 --> 00:48:18,982
Dad, get off of me!

662
00:48:20,817 --> 00:48:23,987
You guys both look terrific.
Show us your bunks.

663
00:48:24,571 --> 00:48:26,448
I wanna see your bunks too.

664
00:48:26,448 --> 00:48:29,576
Did you get your favorite room?
The Acorn Cabin?

665
00:48:29,576 --> 00:48:31,286
Yeah, we did.

666
00:48:31,453 --> 00:48:33,538
We got the Acorn Cabin.

667
00:49:20,752 --> 00:49:22,629
God, I hate lying to them.

668
00:49:22,629 --> 00:49:25,131
Me too. We' re not even good at it.

669
00:49:25,131 --> 00:49:28,218
Even if we were good at it,
they'd still know.

670
00:49:51,408 --> 00:49:53,076
What is that?

671
00:49:53,284 --> 00:49:54,536
What's what?

672
00:49:54,536 --> 00:49:58,123
- The thing you just put in your mouth.
- It's my biteplate.

673
00:49:58,289 --> 00:50:01,001
- Biteplate?
- Yeah. It's my biteplate.

674
00:50:01,418 --> 00:50:04,379
- Why do you have a biteplate?
- For my bite.

675
00:50:05,171 --> 00:50:07,465
What's wrong with your bite?

676
00:50:07,674 --> 00:50:09,259
It's askew.

677
00:50:09,551 --> 00:50:10,802
Askew?

678
00:50:10,802 --> 00:50:12,595
Yes, it's askew.

679
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:15,598
So this would be an attempt
to de-skew it?

680
00:50:21,438 --> 00:50:23,523
You order room service?

681
00:50:30,822 --> 00:50:33,324
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. I' m okay.

682
00:50:33,324 --> 00:50:35,201
Honey, are you okay?

683
00:50:35,201 --> 00:50:37,078
I'm okay. I' m fine.

684
00:50:37,078 --> 00:50:40,331
I couldn't sleep, so
I snuck out after lights out.

685
00:50:40,832 --> 00:50:43,543
I just wanted to sleep
with you guys.

686
00:50:45,837 --> 00:50:49,549
It's okay. I'll call the camp
and let them know you' re here.

687
00:50:54,596 --> 00:50:57,223
Why is the bed made up on the couch?

688
00:50:58,975 --> 00:51:02,937
Daddy was doing a little reading,
and I didn't wanna wake Mommy up.

689
00:51:35,178 --> 00:51:38,390
Sometimes you just can 't
climb out of the abyss.

690
00:51:38,932 --> 00:51:41,434
I thought of last summer,
when we still hoped...

691
00:51:41,434 --> 00:51:44,562
that if we put ourselves
in some idyllic setting...

692
00:51:44,562 --> 00:51:47,691
we 'd somehow get rid
of all the tension...

693
00:51:47,691 --> 00:51:49,567
jump-start our marriage...

694
00:51:49,567 --> 00:51:52,696
and rediscover why we fell in love
in the first place.

695
00:51:52,696 --> 00:51:55,198
So last year,
after Parents ' Weekend...

696
00:51:55,198 --> 00:51:57,701
we thought maybe
in a trattoria in Venice...

697
00:51:57,701 --> 00:52:01,454
looking at a beautiful sunset,
next to a bottle of Chianti...

698
00:52:01,454 --> 00:52:04,582
we just might find a set
ofjumper cables.

699
00:52:06,459 --> 00:52:09,295
How you doing?
Two Italian ices, please.

700
00:52:09,587 --> 00:52:13,299
Honey, you don't have to say Italian.
We' re here. They know.

701
00:52:13,967 --> 00:52:17,721
So if I' m in Belgium, and I order
a Belgian waffle, I just say waffle?

702
00:52:17,721 --> 00:52:21,307
Like if you were in Ireland
and you wanted Irish stew...

703
00:52:21,474 --> 00:52:22,726
you'd just say stew.

704
00:52:22,726 --> 00:52:25,854
If you' re in China and
you want Chinese food...

705
00:52:25,854 --> 00:52:28,356
you say, "Bring on the food".

706
00:52:28,356 --> 00:52:31,818
We couldn't help but overhear
your delightful repartee.

707
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:34,612
We' re the Kirbys from Cleveland.
And you are..?

708
00:52:34,612 --> 00:52:37,115
- The Mansons.
- From Spawn Ranch.

709
00:52:40,869 --> 00:52:42,746
That's a good one.

710
00:52:58,386 --> 00:53:00,263
Look, right there.
The red cape.

711
00:53:00,263 --> 00:53:01,890
I like that.

712
00:53:07,771 --> 00:53:09,022
It's you...

713
00:53:09,022 --> 00:53:09,647
people.

714
00:53:09,647 --> 00:53:12,776
- The Kirbys from Cleveland.
- Joanie and Eddie.

715
00:53:13,401 --> 00:53:16,988
How could we forget?
We haven't stopped talking about you.

716
00:53:17,155 --> 00:53:20,283
This is fate. We have to
get together, break bread.

717
00:53:20,283 --> 00:53:23,578
Sounds great.
We' re at the Hotel Pasta e Fagioli.

718
00:53:24,037 --> 00:53:26,539
You call us.
We' re at the Europa Regina.

719
00:53:26,539 --> 00:53:28,583
Great. We'll call you.

720
00:53:29,042 --> 00:53:30,710
Oh, right on!

721
00:53:32,796 --> 00:53:34,047
Look at this.

722
00:53:34,047 --> 00:53:35,924
- This is beautiful.
- This way.

723
00:53:35,924 --> 00:53:38,426
- Thank you.
- Canal-side seating.

724
00:53:38,426 --> 00:53:39,969
Very nice.

725
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:43,807
Oh, my God!

726
00:53:45,308 --> 00:53:46,935
Meant to be!

727
00:53:47,811 --> 00:53:49,562
Kismet! Kismet!

728
00:53:50,313 --> 00:53:54,067
We went looking for your hotel,
but we couldn't find it anywhere.

729
00:53:54,067 --> 00:53:58,071
- Yeah, it's pretty hard to find.
- Well, all's well that ends well.

730
00:54:00,323 --> 00:54:03,618
It was just like fate,
the first time I met Joanie.

731
00:54:04,077 --> 00:54:07,789
I worked on the 6th floor,
and Eddie worked on the 4th floor.

732
00:54:07,831 --> 00:54:10,333
- Hand to God.
- Every day in the cafeteria...

733
00:54:10,333 --> 00:54:13,461
-...on the third floor...
- I saw Joanie at the salad bar.

734
00:54:13,461 --> 00:54:15,964
And she smiled at me.
Not just a smile.

735
00:54:15,964 --> 00:54:18,216
I mean, a really big smile.

736
00:54:18,466 --> 00:54:21,594
One day at the salad bar
at Beefsteak Charlie's...

737
00:54:21,594 --> 00:54:24,097
I thought I saw her
at that salad bar.

738
00:54:24,097 --> 00:54:26,808
- But it wasn't me.
- It wasn't Joanie!

739
00:54:27,225 --> 00:54:31,521
What are the odds of another person
at a salad bar looking like Joanie...

740
00:54:31,604 --> 00:54:33,982
and yet not being Joanie?

741
00:54:34,107 --> 00:54:36,443
What, like a trillion to one?

742
00:54:36,609 --> 00:54:38,486
Could be higher than that.

743
00:54:38,486 --> 00:54:42,365
Anyway, when I realized it wasn't
Joanie, I was so disappointed.

744
00:54:42,866 --> 00:54:46,745
And I began to think about how much
I'd hoped that it was Joanie.

745
00:54:47,245 --> 00:54:49,748
But at this point
you still hadn't met.

746
00:54:49,748 --> 00:54:53,877
No. And I couldn't get over how much
I wanted this person to be Joanie.

747
00:54:54,753 --> 00:54:57,630
And I think that was
the defining moment.

748
00:54:57,881 --> 00:55:01,634
I went back to my wife at the table
at Beefsteak Charlie's...

749
00:55:01,634 --> 00:55:05,388
and I realized I felt more alive
thinking about that stranger...

750
00:55:05,388 --> 00:55:09,559
I thought was Joanie than I did
with the stranger who was my wife.

751
00:55:09,768 --> 00:55:12,270
We were both in marriages
we'd outgrown.

752
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:15,398
You know, maybe I didn't
wanna admit it, but maybe...

753
00:55:15,398 --> 00:55:19,152
I didn't like myself enough
to be with someone who liked me.

754
00:55:19,152 --> 00:55:22,280
Can you imagine anybody
not liking Eddie Kirby?

755
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,240
I'm not so perfect.

756
00:55:24,783 --> 00:55:26,493
Beg to differ!

757
00:55:26,659 --> 00:55:30,663
That year we both mustered up
enough courage to leave our marriages.

758
00:55:31,664 --> 00:55:34,000
So at this point you had met.

759
00:55:34,793 --> 00:55:36,628
Still hadn't met.

760
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:40,382
But, you know, after you've had
such a horrible marriage...

761
00:55:40,423 --> 00:55:43,551
you don't wanna make
the same mistakes twice.

762
00:55:43,551 --> 00:55:46,179
So I made an inner pact with myself.

763
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:50,433
I said, "Eddie, you will never
let anger build up to the point...

764
00:55:50,433 --> 00:55:52,310
where you don't like
your partner".

765
00:55:52,310 --> 00:55:54,813
- I made the same pact.
- That became our credo.

766
00:55:54,813 --> 00:55:57,023
"Never go to bed angry".

767
00:55:57,941 --> 00:56:00,443
So now we talk everything through.

768
00:56:00,443 --> 00:56:03,947
We won't let even the tiniest pea
be under our mattress.

769
00:56:04,823 --> 00:56:07,283
That's why we never eat in bed.

770
00:56:10,453 --> 00:56:11,871
Me too.

771
00:56:15,458 --> 00:56:17,961
Who 'd have thought the Kirbys...

772
00:56:17,961 --> 00:56:20,463
the happiest couple
never to have met...

773
00:56:20,463 --> 00:56:23,883
would be the greatest
aphrodisiac known to man?

774
00:56:48,616 --> 00:56:51,745
If only you could bottle
that unfettered state of mind...

775
00:56:51,745 --> 00:56:54,247
that comes with being
on foreign soil...

776
00:56:54,247 --> 00:56:56,124
to just hold on to it...

777
00:56:56,124 --> 00:56:58,793
even for a day, an evening...

778
00:56:59,252 --> 00:57:00,920
an hour.

779
00:57:01,129 --> 00:57:04,257
Last year, when we
got back from Italy, God knows...

780
00:57:04,257 --> 00:57:06,343
we gave it a try.

781
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:22,817
Hey, look at this.

782
00:57:23,443 --> 00:57:27,572
While we were away, we got a message
from His Holiness, the Dalai Lama.

783
00:57:29,074 --> 00:57:32,077
About a softball team
he's getting started.

784
00:57:32,827 --> 00:57:37,040
You wanna write a letter to the kids
together, let them know we' re back?

785
00:57:42,212 --> 00:57:44,005
"Dear Josh...

786
00:57:45,965 --> 00:57:47,759
and Erin".

787
00:57:47,842 --> 00:57:50,303
Oh, sure. You get the easy part.

788
00:57:54,099 --> 00:57:55,725
"We' re...

789
00:57:56,601 --> 00:57:58,269
back".

790
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:02,565
"From...

791
00:58:03,483 --> 00:58:05,235
Europe".

792
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:08,488
That's not a sentence.
It's a preposition and a continent.

793
00:58:08,488 --> 00:58:10,990
I crossed out your period
and made a sentence.

794
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:13,952
See? "We' re back from Europe".
Your turn.

795
00:58:14,119 --> 00:58:15,662
Thank you.

796
00:58:15,995 --> 00:58:18,998
Exclamation point.
Comma. Close parentheses.

797
00:58:20,375 --> 00:58:22,043
"But I...

798
00:58:22,877 --> 00:58:25,171
don't want to talk...

799
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:27,382
about grammar".

800
00:58:27,882 --> 00:58:29,968
Colon". I want to...

801
00:58:32,887 --> 00:58:34,973
make love to...

802
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:37,308
your mother".

803
00:58:39,144 --> 00:58:41,354
No, you didn't write that.

804
00:58:44,149 --> 00:58:46,192
What? I do. I want to.

805
00:58:46,651 --> 00:58:48,903
After we finish the letter.

806
00:58:49,154 --> 00:58:52,657
No, let's make love right now.
Then we write the letter.

807
00:58:53,533 --> 00:58:56,661
Come on, we only had
a couple of sentences to go.

808
00:58:56,661 --> 00:58:59,497
In Europe, you would've
made love first.

809
00:59:01,041 --> 00:59:03,543
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

810
00:59:03,543 --> 00:59:06,671
- That I' m not spontaneous?
- I'm not saying that.

811
00:59:06,671 --> 00:59:08,548
But that's what you implied.

812
00:59:08,548 --> 00:59:11,051
That in Europe I'd have
made love, but here...

813
00:59:11,051 --> 00:59:13,553
I don't want us to get to the point...

814
00:59:13,553 --> 00:59:17,307
where we can't make love unless
there's a concierge downstairs.

815
00:59:17,307 --> 00:59:21,394
I wanted to take three minutes
to finish a letter to our children...

816
00:59:21,686 --> 00:59:23,563
who I haven't seen...

817
00:59:23,563 --> 00:59:27,317
What's that supposed to mean?
That I don't care about our children?

818
00:59:27,317 --> 00:59:29,819
If I finish the letter,
I could be spontaneous.

819
00:59:29,819 --> 00:59:32,947
That's not spontaneous!
That's making an appointment!

820
00:59:32,947 --> 00:59:36,076
I was in the mood
for unscheduled affection...

821
00:59:36,076 --> 00:59:37,952
but sorry, we' re home. I forgot...

822
00:59:37,952 --> 00:59:40,830
everything's gotta be
on a schedule!

823
00:59:41,081 --> 00:59:44,793
You try raising children
where everything's unscheduled...

824
00:59:44,834 --> 00:59:46,711
when everything's spontaneous!

825
00:59:46,711 --> 00:59:50,131
You know what? The kids need
a little spontaneity too!

826
00:59:51,091 --> 00:59:52,717
I know that!

827
00:59:52,967 --> 00:59:56,971
I'm sick and tired of being
the designated driver of this marriage!

828
00:59:57,347 --> 01:00:00,475
Nobody designated you!
It's a role you gave yourself!

829
01:00:00,475 --> 01:00:02,936
Bullshit! You gave me that role!

830
01:00:02,977 --> 01:00:07,190
Because God forbid Ben should ever
remember to cancel the newspapers...

831
01:00:07,357 --> 01:00:09,234
or put washer fluid in his car...

832
01:00:09,234 --> 01:00:12,362
or participate in disciplining
his children...

833
01:00:12,362 --> 01:00:15,490
instead of flirting on the phone
with your girlfriend!

834
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:17,367
You' re not bringing that up again!

835
01:00:17,367 --> 01:00:19,869
You' re damn straight
I'll bring it up again!

836
01:00:19,869 --> 01:00:22,372
I haven't spoken to her
in six months!

837
01:00:22,372 --> 01:00:24,874
Not once have you seen it
through my eyes!

838
01:00:24,874 --> 01:00:28,628
We don't have a pea under our mattress.
You know what we have?

839
01:00:28,628 --> 01:00:29,879
A fucking watermelon!

840
01:00:29,879 --> 01:00:32,382
And you never wanna deal with it!

841
01:00:32,382 --> 01:00:34,009
Oh, fuck it!

842
01:00:34,259 --> 01:00:35,635
Jesus!

843
01:00:43,643 --> 01:00:45,311
Welcome home.

844
01:00:53,278 --> 01:00:54,821
Bye, Dad.

845
01:00:55,155 --> 01:00:57,198
- Thanks.
- I love you.

846
01:00:58,283 --> 01:01:00,201
- Bye, Mom.
- Buddy.

847
01:01:02,037 --> 01:01:03,538
Love you.

848
01:01:04,539 --> 01:01:06,666
See you guys in a month.

849
01:01:12,672 --> 01:01:14,382
Bye, you guys.

850
01:01:15,175 --> 01:01:17,052
- Bye, Daddy.
- Couple of weeks.

851
01:01:17,052 --> 01:01:18,928
- Watch your toes.
- See you.

852
01:01:18,928 --> 01:01:20,472
Bye, kids.

853
01:01:36,446 --> 01:01:39,491
Do you think we should get
one lawyer or two?

854
01:01:43,328 --> 01:01:44,621
One.

855
01:01:46,456 --> 01:01:49,417
Maybe we can at least
make this part....

856
01:01:52,087 --> 01:01:56,132
All I care about is that we make it
as easy for the kids as possible.

857
01:02:00,845 --> 01:02:05,016
I'm sure you noticed the bathroom has
the original tiling from the '20s.

858
01:02:05,225 --> 01:02:06,476
It's nice.

859
01:02:06,476 --> 01:02:10,230
You know, since you' re a writer,
I know you'd appreciate...

860
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:12,732
that the sister
of Bette Davis' chauffeur...

861
01:02:12,732 --> 01:02:16,152
once had Thanksgiving
in the apartment next door.

862
01:02:16,486 --> 01:02:17,904
Really?

863
01:02:18,988 --> 01:02:21,491
Are there any other kids
in this building?

864
01:02:21,491 --> 01:02:25,286
Oodles! Including, if I might add,
the nephew of the actor...

865
01:02:25,870 --> 01:02:28,998
who jumped third into
the fourth lifeboat on Titanic.

866
01:02:28,998 --> 01:02:32,085
Rent the film, you'll see.
I'll introduce you.

867
01:02:32,127 --> 01:02:36,297
I'm showing it to another family today,
but if you' re interested...

868
01:02:36,506 --> 01:02:39,634
I can hold it for you,
give your wife a look-see...

869
01:02:39,634 --> 01:02:40,885
I'm interested.

870
01:02:40,885 --> 01:02:44,889
Who wouldn't be? Look how the light
from that window fills the room.

871
01:02:45,265 --> 01:02:47,142
When I showed this apartment...

872
01:02:47,142 --> 01:02:50,270
to the man who did the voice
of Charlie the Tuna...

873
01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:53,273
he said, and I quote,
"Wow", unquote.

874
01:02:54,649 --> 01:02:56,860
I think that says it all.

875
01:02:59,029 --> 01:03:00,905
First, you put olive oil...

876
01:03:00,905 --> 01:03:02,782
garlic and tofu.

877
01:03:02,782 --> 01:03:05,410
Saute until garlic turn light brown.

878
01:03:05,910 --> 01:03:09,456
Make sure that your wok have
a strong heat underneath it.

879
01:03:09,664 --> 01:03:12,709
Now take an egg and crack it
to the hot oil.

880
01:03:14,669 --> 01:03:18,006
Make sure all the ingredients
are cooked thoroughly.

881
01:03:19,674 --> 01:03:20,925
You okay?

882
01:03:20,925 --> 01:03:22,719
Yeah, I' m fine.

883
01:03:24,054 --> 01:03:26,514
Now we add some Pad Thai noodle.

884
01:03:28,433 --> 01:03:32,062
I saw Deirdre up at Parents' Weekend,
but I didn't see you.

885
01:03:32,187 --> 01:03:34,064
I went up the weekend before.

886
01:03:34,064 --> 01:03:36,524
You know, since the divorce...

887
01:03:36,566 --> 01:03:40,320
it's a lot easier for everyone
if we come up at separate times.

888
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:43,448
Kevin and I took a great hike
up to that waterfall.

889
01:03:43,448 --> 01:03:45,325
You and Ben take that hike?

890
01:03:45,325 --> 01:03:47,452
Yeah, it was beautiful.

891
01:03:48,453 --> 01:03:51,039
Spice it up with some chili pepper.

892
01:03:51,581 --> 01:03:54,459
You know, spicy food
make a better lover.

893
01:03:54,709 --> 01:03:57,504
The hotter you eat,
the hotter you get.

894
01:03:58,463 --> 01:04:01,091
Well, the spicier the better for me.

895
01:04:02,217 --> 01:04:03,885
Rice vinegar.

896
01:04:07,847 --> 01:04:09,974
Does Ben like Thai food?

897
01:04:11,601 --> 01:04:13,478
You and Ben been to Tommy Tang's?

898
01:04:13,478 --> 01:04:15,355
Ben and I are di...

899
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:17,565
Separated.

900
01:04:18,483 --> 01:04:20,360
Gee, I had no idea.

901
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,862
We' re not really telling people.

902
01:04:22,862 --> 01:04:24,572
I understand.

903
01:04:24,739 --> 01:04:26,866
I'm so sorry. How long?

904
01:04:28,493 --> 01:04:31,162
72 hours, four weeks, five years...

905
01:04:32,872 --> 01:04:35,375
depending on when
you start counting.

906
01:04:35,375 --> 01:04:38,420
I'm really sorry.
I know how hard it can be.

907
01:04:41,631 --> 01:04:43,508
This will sound crazy...

908
01:04:43,508 --> 01:04:46,636
but I always enjoyed
Erin and Josh's appointments...

909
01:04:46,636 --> 01:04:50,015
because it gave me a chance
to get to know you.

910
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:53,351
But when you called me
about your bite...

911
01:04:53,518 --> 01:04:57,647
I felt myself looking forward to it
because I knew we'd be alone.

912
01:04:59,149 --> 01:05:01,860
And just tell me if it's too soon...

913
01:05:02,902 --> 01:05:06,781
but I wondered if maybe you
wanted to have dinner sometime?

914
01:05:08,533 --> 01:05:10,535
We are having dinner.

915
01:05:12,287 --> 01:05:15,874
I was thinking of something
that didn't involve a teacher.

916
01:05:19,169 --> 01:05:21,588
You always hear people say...

917
01:05:21,671 --> 01:05:24,174
they stayed too long
in a bad marriage.

918
01:05:24,174 --> 01:05:27,927
For the longest time, I never thought
of my marriage as being bad.

919
01:05:27,927 --> 01:05:31,681
I thought love was something you
were allowed to fall in and out of.

920
01:05:31,681 --> 01:05:33,975
You know, peaks and valleys.

921
01:05:34,184 --> 01:05:36,061
But after a while...

922
01:05:36,061 --> 01:05:39,064
the peaks get lower
and further apart.

923
01:05:39,814 --> 01:05:43,568
Then one day you find yourself
wondering, "Is this who I really am?

924
01:05:43,568 --> 01:05:47,238
Someone who has taken up permanent
residence in the valley?

925
01:05:47,322 --> 01:05:50,325
Or is this just who I am
with this person?"

926
01:05:52,327 --> 01:05:54,621
And then, you ask yourself..

927
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:59,042
"Maybe there is another version
of my life, of myself...

928
01:05:59,209 --> 01:06:01,544
that's a happier one".

929
01:06:18,603 --> 01:06:20,105
Bullshit.

930
01:06:21,731 --> 01:06:24,859
"Yossel looked into Minnie's eyes
and felt...

931
01:06:26,736 --> 01:06:27,987
nothing.

932
01:06:27,987 --> 01:06:30,448
For two years they'd been apart.

933
01:06:32,992 --> 01:06:35,829
And now, as she stepped off the boat...

934
01:06:36,121 --> 01:06:39,416
he realized he was
looking into the eyes...

935
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,419
of a stranger.

936
01:06:44,254 --> 01:06:46,423
A girl he no longer knew.

937
01:06:47,382 --> 01:06:49,592
He had become an American.

938
01:06:51,761 --> 01:06:54,180
And she was still the poor...

939
01:06:59,269 --> 01:07:01,438
unaffectionate...

940
01:07:02,397 --> 01:07:04,274
daughter...

941
01:07:05,525 --> 01:07:08,445
of a blind Lithuanian
violin maker".

942
01:07:10,113 --> 01:07:13,992
It's fear. It was all about fear.
Fear's what kept them together.

943
01:07:14,492 --> 01:07:17,620
This whole time I've idealized
my grandparents' marriage.

944
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:20,331
But this was not the love of the ages.

945
01:07:20,749 --> 01:07:23,877
The two stayed together
because they were terrified.

946
01:07:23,877 --> 01:07:27,422
Fear of loneliness, fear of fallure,
fear of the unknown.

947
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:31,051
Sure, fear. That's the main
motivator for everything.

948
01:07:31,384 --> 01:07:35,138
That and gullt are the two emotions
that keep a society humming.

949
01:07:35,138 --> 01:07:37,640
You and Rachel stay together
because of fear?

950
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:39,517
- In a word, yes.
- You' re okay with that?

951
01:07:39,517 --> 01:07:41,770
In three words, yes and no.

952
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:45,899
See, it's not that simple.
You' re looking for clear-cut answers.

953
01:07:46,399 --> 01:07:50,111
In reality, there's nothing clear-cut.
Life is not clear-cut.

954
01:07:50,153 --> 01:07:51,821
Life is gray.

955
01:07:52,030 --> 01:07:53,698
For instance:

956
01:07:55,158 --> 01:07:57,410
What do you see right here?

957
01:07:59,537 --> 01:08:02,665
- What are you asking me?
- I'm asking you, what do you see?

958
01:08:02,665 --> 01:08:04,417
I see your ass.

959
01:08:04,542 --> 01:08:08,338
That's what you think you see.
But in reality, there is no ass.

960
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:13,551
What the f..?
What are you telling me?

961
01:08:13,927 --> 01:08:17,806
There is no ass, just the fatty part
at the top of each leg...

962
01:08:18,932 --> 01:08:21,434
that is butted up
against each other.

963
01:08:21,434 --> 01:08:23,311
Hence the word "butt".

964
01:08:23,311 --> 01:08:25,188
See, essentially...

965
01:08:25,188 --> 01:08:28,942
what we' re dealing with here is
just a continuation of the leg.

966
01:08:28,942 --> 01:08:31,444
Okay, all right, now you lost me.

967
01:08:32,070 --> 01:08:35,448
It's all Illusions.
There is no such thing as an ass.

968
01:08:35,824 --> 01:08:39,953
Just like there's no such thing as
the perfect marriage, job or child.

969
01:08:40,203 --> 01:08:44,332
The whole notion of staying together
and living happlly ever after...

970
01:08:45,208 --> 01:08:46,459
all illusions.

971
01:08:46,459 --> 01:08:49,838
You' re saying you don't believe
in everlasting love?

972
01:08:50,213 --> 01:08:53,800
You' re seeing the ass again
and not the tops of the legs.

973
01:08:55,218 --> 01:08:58,304
Love is just lust in disguise.
And lust fades.

974
01:08:58,972 --> 01:09:02,559
So you damn well better be
with someone who can stand you.

975
01:09:02,726 --> 01:09:06,479
Katie and I have moved way past
being able to stand each other.

976
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:08,982
We've moved right
into the hatred part.

977
01:09:08,982 --> 01:09:11,735
I wouldn't worry about it.
Hate fades.

978
01:09:12,736 --> 01:09:14,320
Hate fades?

979
01:09:17,115 --> 01:09:20,702
That's what you' re gonna send me out
into the world with?

980
01:09:20,869 --> 01:09:23,955
"Hate fades. Love is lust.
There is no ass".

981
01:09:25,874 --> 01:09:28,960
What a disappointment
you've turned out to be.

982
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:34,007
Just promise me one thing.

983
01:09:34,007 --> 01:09:37,761
Please promise me that you will not
say any of this to Rachel.

984
01:09:37,761 --> 01:09:40,722
Are you crazy?
This conversation ends here.

985
01:09:41,014 --> 01:09:43,975
When Stan called me,
I couldn't believe it.

986
01:09:44,142 --> 01:09:46,644
I knew it was rough for you guys...

987
01:09:46,644 --> 01:09:49,773
We didn't wanna say untll we knew
we weren't getting back together.

988
01:09:49,773 --> 01:09:51,399
Oh, my God.

989
01:09:54,152 --> 01:09:55,403
How are you doing?

990
01:09:55,403 --> 01:09:58,365
I don't know.
I thought I'd be devastated.

991
01:09:58,531 --> 01:10:00,825
Maybe it just hasn't hit me.

992
01:10:02,911 --> 01:10:06,373
- You' re having an affair.
- What are you talking about?

993
01:10:06,664 --> 01:10:09,793
You' re only not devastated
if you' re seeing someone else.

994
01:10:09,793 --> 01:10:11,670
I'm not seeing someone else.

995
01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:13,546
Are you serious about
who you' re not seeing?

996
01:10:13,546 --> 01:10:16,508
I don't know.
I know he's nothing like Ben.

997
01:10:16,675 --> 01:10:19,803
He's responsible, plans ahead,
has a Swiss Army knife.

998
01:10:19,803 --> 01:10:21,680
He even wants to cook me dinner.

999
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:23,556
- He's a sandbag.
- A what?

1000
01:10:23,556 --> 01:10:26,059
He's just a sandbag
against the storm...

1001
01:10:26,059 --> 01:10:29,104
holding off the inevitable
devastation.

1002
01:10:31,690 --> 01:10:33,525
Rachel, you okay?

1003
01:10:36,069 --> 01:10:37,445
Honey?

1004
01:10:39,823 --> 01:10:41,408
I'm sorry.

1005
01:10:42,951 --> 01:10:46,538
I know I' m supposed to be the one
holding your hand...

1006
01:10:46,705 --> 01:10:49,124
but I just feel terrible.

1007
01:10:49,207 --> 01:10:52,335
I mean, the thought of you guys
not being together....

1008
01:10:52,335 --> 01:10:54,504
You' re our best friends.

1009
01:10:54,838 --> 01:10:58,091
Fourth of Julys and Thanksgivings
and Christmases.

1010
01:10:59,217 --> 01:11:02,012
You guys were our
Fred and Ethel Mertz.

1011
01:11:02,345 --> 01:11:05,598
We thought you guys were
our Fred and Ethel Mertz.

1012
01:11:06,099 --> 01:11:07,517
Really?

1013
01:11:07,976 --> 01:11:11,438
I never thought this was
going to happen to me and Ben.

1014
01:11:12,355 --> 01:11:15,942
I thought we were going to be the ones
to go the distance.

1015
01:11:16,109 --> 01:11:20,071
But I just couldn't seem to get him
to put down that purple crayon.

1016
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:24,951
But that's Ben.
That's who you fell in love with.

1017
01:11:26,119 --> 01:11:28,872
Katie, you are at 80
who you are at 8.

1018
01:11:29,247 --> 01:11:31,207
People don't change!

1019
01:11:32,208 --> 01:11:35,503
People change over time.
You've got to expect that.

1020
01:11:35,962 --> 01:11:40,133
The only way a relationship works is
if people grow and change together.

1021
01:11:42,218 --> 01:11:44,095
Mr. and Mrs. Cogen, Mr. Jordan.

1022
01:11:44,095 --> 01:11:48,141
Nice to have you tonight. Is Mrs.
Jordan not joining us this evening?

1023
01:11:48,475 --> 01:11:52,395
No, she's not. Stan, I told you
to make the reservation for three!

1024
01:11:52,854 --> 01:11:55,357
- I forgot.
- How could you forget that?

1025
01:11:55,357 --> 01:11:57,859
Say it louder. The guy
in the lot didn't hear you.

1026
01:11:57,859 --> 01:11:59,861
It wasn't that loud.

1027
01:12:06,618 --> 01:12:08,495
Did you see Sunday's 7 down?

1028
01:12:08,495 --> 01:12:10,997
- I missed that one.
- Five-letter word.

1029
01:12:10,997 --> 01:12:13,083
"Wants, requirements".

1030
01:12:14,125 --> 01:12:16,002
Rhymes with weeds.

1031
01:12:16,002 --> 01:12:17,253
"Needs"?

1032
01:12:17,253 --> 01:12:20,006
Exactly.
It was a direct attack on me.

1033
01:12:20,382 --> 01:12:22,258
Come on. You' re being silly.

1034
01:12:22,258 --> 01:12:25,136
It was just a clue
in a crossword puzzle.

1035
01:12:25,387 --> 01:12:28,640
I know my wife.
She was specifically attacking me.

1036
01:12:29,140 --> 01:12:30,809
And for what?

1037
01:12:31,017 --> 01:12:32,852
For having needs.

1038
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,022
Like having needs is
some terrible thing.

1039
01:12:36,022 --> 01:12:38,983
Show me one person
that doesn't have needs.

1040
01:12:41,653 --> 01:12:44,781
Try this bread dipped in
the olive oil. It's delicious.

1041
01:12:44,781 --> 01:12:46,658
Stan, give Ben the bread!

1042
01:12:46,658 --> 01:12:48,535
Why must you yell?

1043
01:12:48,535 --> 01:12:49,786
- Who yelled?
- You.

1044
01:12:49,786 --> 01:12:51,037
That's not a yell.

1045
01:12:51,037 --> 01:12:53,456
He hears everything as a yell.

1046
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:56,042
On anyone's yell-o-meter,
that was a yell.

1047
01:12:56,042 --> 01:12:58,545
Was that a yell?
He didn't hear it as a yell.

1048
01:12:58,545 --> 01:13:00,422
His mom was a yeller.
He still hears her.

1049
01:13:00,422 --> 01:13:03,258
How could I hear her?
You drown her out.

1050
01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:04,801
It's true.

1051
01:13:04,801 --> 01:13:07,303
The last few years,
when Katie opened her mouth...

1052
01:13:07,303 --> 01:13:09,806
all I'd hear was her mother.

1053
01:13:10,432 --> 01:13:11,683
Dot.

1054
01:13:11,683 --> 01:13:15,812
It wasn't easy for Katie to be raised
by a woman as complicated as Dot.

1055
01:13:16,688 --> 01:13:19,149
Please, she wasn't complicated.

1056
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:22,861
She was an idiot who made
everyone else's life complicated.

1057
01:13:22,944 --> 01:13:26,698
You wouldn't believe the beautiful
psychological heirlooms...

1058
01:13:26,698 --> 01:13:29,200
this snapping turtle handed down.

1059
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:31,703
Everything's gotta be
in a neat little box...

1060
01:13:31,703 --> 01:13:34,247
with a little blue bow on it.

1061
01:13:34,831 --> 01:13:36,082
Punctual.

1062
01:13:36,082 --> 01:13:37,334
Ordered.

1063
01:13:37,334 --> 01:13:40,545
God forbid anything unexpected
should happen...

1064
01:13:41,087 --> 01:13:43,840
any perchances, happenstances...

1065
01:13:44,215 --> 01:13:46,634
left turns, serendipities!

1066
01:13:47,344 --> 01:13:49,596
Nope, no way! Not allowed!

1067
01:13:50,472 --> 01:13:52,682
Out-of-bounds! Foul ball!

1068
01:13:52,974 --> 01:13:56,227
15-yard penalty!
Too much time being spontaneous!

1069
01:13:57,354 --> 01:14:00,482
Everything's gotta be connected.
Gotta connect the dots.

1070
01:14:00,482 --> 01:14:02,984
Maybe that's why they call her Dot.

1071
01:14:02,984 --> 01:14:06,237
You notice that her name wasn't
Gay or Joy or Fun!

1072
01:14:06,738 --> 01:14:07,989
Try the bread...

1073
01:14:07,989 --> 01:14:11,284
You can't even fuck
unless everything's just right!

1074
01:14:11,743 --> 01:14:15,163
Like a plane waiting for takeoff.
Windows shut? Check.

1075
01:14:16,122 --> 01:14:18,792
Doors locked? Check!
Heat on? Check!

1076
01:14:19,876 --> 01:14:23,004
Have we covered every possible,
single reason...

1077
01:14:23,004 --> 01:14:24,881
why everything is my fault?!

1078
01:14:24,881 --> 01:14:27,967
Houston, we got a problem
and her name is Dot!

1079
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:32,389
- Ben, bread.
- There are people like Katie and Dot...

1080
01:14:32,389 --> 01:14:35,517
who color inside the lines,
and people like you...

1081
01:14:35,517 --> 01:14:39,270
who wander outside.
That can be a very endearing quality.

1082
01:14:39,270 --> 01:14:42,399
That's why Katie fell in love
with you. Once you have kids...

1083
01:14:42,399 --> 01:14:44,275
I am not a third child!

1084
01:14:44,275 --> 01:14:47,153
Excuse me if my watch
has no hands on it.

1085
01:14:47,404 --> 01:14:51,199
That's fine. It's just, somebody
has to establish the routine...

1086
01:14:51,783 --> 01:14:54,327
Are you saying it's all my fault?!

1087
01:14:54,911 --> 01:14:56,788
It's nobody's fault!

1088
01:14:56,788 --> 01:14:59,916
When people say it's nobody's fault,
they don't mean that.

1089
01:14:59,916 --> 01:15:03,628
They mean it's your fault!
The nobody's fault things are...

1090
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:07,132
hurricanes, earthquakes,
tornadoes, acts of God!

1091
01:15:07,424 --> 01:15:11,011
But when a marriage falls,
it's gotta be somebody's fault!

1092
01:15:11,803 --> 01:15:13,680
And it's not mine!

1093
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:17,434
Take that fucking bread and shove it
up the tops of your legs!

1094
01:16:00,769 --> 01:16:04,731
Maybe I'm tired! Maybe I'm dealing
with 5000 things all day long!

1095
01:16:05,148 --> 01:16:07,650
Maybe every need you have
doesn 't have to be met...

1096
01:16:07,650 --> 01:16:10,153
at the exact moment
you need it to be met!

1097
01:16:10,153 --> 01:16:14,157
I'm sick and tired of being
the designated driver of this marriage!

1098
01:16:14,532 --> 01:16:17,660
Nobody designated you!
It's a role you gave yourself!

1099
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:20,622
Not once have you seen it
through my eyes!

1100
01:16:20,789 --> 01:16:24,542
We don 't have a pea under our mattress.
You know what we have?

1101
01:16:24,542 --> 01:16:26,586
A fucking watermelon!

1102
01:16:37,055 --> 01:16:38,556
You okay?

1103
01:16:40,183 --> 01:16:42,102
Take me to Katie's.

1104
01:16:47,065 --> 01:16:48,942
What are you doing here?

1105
01:16:48,942 --> 01:16:51,861
I wanted to know what
your high was today.

1106
01:16:53,321 --> 01:16:55,365
You should've called.

1107
01:16:55,824 --> 01:16:57,867
My high was about you.

1108
01:17:00,829 --> 01:17:03,623
Tonight I saw myself
through your eyes.

1109
01:17:08,962 --> 01:17:10,213
And I' m sorry.

1110
01:17:10,213 --> 01:17:12,090
It might be a nice touch...

1111
01:17:12,090 --> 01:17:15,427
if you add some roasted peanuts
to the sesame...

1112
01:17:21,474 --> 01:17:25,020
At some point we should discuss
how to tell the children.

1113
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:58,970
How you doing? Come on in.

1114
01:17:59,888 --> 01:18:01,556
This is nice.

1115
01:18:01,765 --> 01:18:03,016
Thanks.

1116
01:18:03,016 --> 01:18:06,144
It's close to the park.
The kids and I can walk.

1117
01:18:06,144 --> 01:18:08,438
You want something to drink?

1118
01:18:08,646 --> 01:18:11,816
I'll take water if you don't have
anything else.

1119
01:18:13,651 --> 01:18:16,154
We have pretty much
anything you want.

1120
01:18:16,154 --> 01:18:18,031
Beer, Gatorade...

1121
01:18:18,031 --> 01:18:20,283
fruit juice, iced tea.

1122
01:18:20,533 --> 01:18:22,369
Iced tea is fine.

1123
01:18:29,918 --> 01:18:31,169
Here you go.

1124
01:18:31,169 --> 01:18:33,004
You have a watch.

1125
01:18:35,548 --> 01:18:37,133
Come on in.

1126
01:18:38,677 --> 01:18:40,387
Sit down here.

1127
01:18:50,563 --> 01:18:52,732
I think we should....

1128
01:18:54,317 --> 01:18:58,446
When we pick the kids up Thursday,
we should just tell them that night.

1129
01:18:59,322 --> 01:19:02,033
We don't have to tell them right away.

1130
01:19:03,076 --> 01:19:04,327
Why?

1131
01:19:04,327 --> 01:19:07,247
What will change
between now and Thursday?

1132
01:19:08,707 --> 01:19:11,209
Katie, you' re seeing someone else.

1133
01:19:11,209 --> 01:19:13,169
I'm not seeing him.

1134
01:19:13,712 --> 01:19:15,714
We' re just talking.

1135
01:19:17,465 --> 01:19:18,842
Right.

1136
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:26,224
I won't put up with any more of this
bullshit lying to the kids.

1137
01:19:26,224 --> 01:19:29,978
We take them to Chow Fun's, their
favorite restaurant, to tell them.

1138
01:19:29,978 --> 01:19:32,564
We can't really talk at Chow Fun's.

1139
01:19:33,106 --> 01:19:35,608
We'll go to the house
and tell them at dinner.

1140
01:19:35,608 --> 01:19:36,860
After dinner.

1141
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:39,237
We'll all sit down and....

1142
01:19:39,362 --> 01:19:41,573
Jesus, how do we say this?

1143
01:19:45,618 --> 01:19:48,747
We'll just tell them
how much we love them...

1144
01:19:50,623 --> 01:19:53,126
how amazing and beautiful
they are...

1145
01:19:53,126 --> 01:19:56,254
so they don't think
that any of this is their fault.

1146
01:19:56,254 --> 01:19:58,548
That's the important thing.

1147
01:20:00,008 --> 01:20:01,885
We'll just say that...

1148
01:20:01,885 --> 01:20:04,095
Mommy and Daddy...

1149
01:20:05,638 --> 01:20:07,891
or Mom and Dad....

1150
01:20:08,141 --> 01:20:10,018
You think Mom and Dad?

1151
01:20:10,018 --> 01:20:11,811
Mommy and Daddy.

1152
01:20:13,146 --> 01:20:16,316
We'll say that Mommy and Daddy
have grown apart.

1153
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:20,653
I was just thinking about Erin.
She'll probably say something like:

1154
01:20:20,653 --> 01:20:24,157
"Well, there must be something right
about you guys...

1155
01:20:24,407 --> 01:20:27,994
for you to produce
such beautiful and amazing kids".

1156
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:35,543
She might say something like that,
you know?

1157
01:20:43,802 --> 01:20:46,554
We'll just tell her that they were...

1158
01:20:47,555 --> 01:20:50,058
born in love and we'll
always love them...

1159
01:20:50,058 --> 01:20:53,561
but Mommy and Daddy
don't love each other anymore.

1160
01:20:55,063 --> 01:20:58,233
Well, wouldn't it be better
if we told them...

1161
01:21:01,945 --> 01:21:05,365
we still love each other,
but in a different way?

1162
01:21:06,950 --> 01:21:08,284
Fine.

1163
01:21:09,452 --> 01:21:12,455
- We shouldn't say that?
- I said it was fine.

1164
01:21:13,206 --> 01:21:15,875
Well, it was kind of a weird "fine".

1165
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:21,006
Should I be thrilled about how we
love each other in a different way?

1166
01:21:33,226 --> 01:21:35,729
- Who is it?
- Mr. Jordan, your couch is here.

1167
01:21:35,729 --> 01:21:38,440
Where have you guys been?
Come on in.

1168
01:21:40,108 --> 01:21:43,611
They were supposed to be here
first thing this morning.

1169
01:21:49,492 --> 01:21:52,203
I'll pick you up at 5:00
on Thursday?

1170
01:22:06,384 --> 01:22:08,178
So is there...

1171
01:22:08,887 --> 01:22:11,389
anything else
we need to talk about?

1172
01:22:11,389 --> 01:22:12,932
Like what?

1173
01:22:15,769 --> 01:22:17,270
Nothing.

1174
01:22:20,148 --> 01:22:21,441
Bye.

1175
01:22:43,129 --> 01:22:44,381
What happened to you?

1176
01:22:44,381 --> 01:22:47,509
What happened to that fun girl
with the pith helmet?

1177
01:22:47,509 --> 01:22:50,595
You don 't think I ask myself
that every day?

1178
01:22:51,888 --> 01:22:53,765
I'm talking about a connection!

1179
01:22:53,765 --> 01:22:57,602
A look! Something that says
that we 're on the same side here!

1180
01:22:59,396 --> 01:23:01,898
Isn 't this the moment
where one of us says..

1181
01:23:01,898 --> 01:23:04,401
"This is ridiculous.
We love each other.

1182
01:23:04,401 --> 01:23:07,946
All couples go through this.
Let's give it another try"?

1183
01:23:20,667 --> 01:23:23,044
It was supposed to rain today.

1184
01:23:23,795 --> 01:23:25,547
Glad it didn't.

1185
01:23:26,923 --> 01:23:28,341
Me too.

1186
01:23:32,554 --> 01:23:35,306
Turn here. If you take Sepulveda....

1187
01:23:37,559 --> 01:23:38,893
What?

1188
01:23:39,436 --> 01:23:40,937
Nothing.

1189
01:23:54,451 --> 01:23:56,745
Do you, Katie, take Ben...

1190
01:23:56,953 --> 01:23:59,330
to have and to hold...

1191
01:23:59,456 --> 01:24:01,332
in sickness and in health...

1192
01:24:01,332 --> 01:24:03,835
for better or for worse...

1193
01:24:03,835 --> 01:24:06,463
-...tilldeath do you part?
- I do.

1194
01:24:10,091 --> 01:24:11,968
It's a boy.
It's a girl.

1195
01:24:11,968 --> 01:24:13,219
It's a bunny!

1196
01:24:13,219 --> 01:24:15,013
It's a home run!

1197
01:24:15,096 --> 01:24:16,348
It's chickenpox.

1198
01:24:16,348 --> 01:24:17,599
It's over.

1199
01:24:17,599 --> 01:24:18,850
I love you.

1200
01:24:18,850 --> 01:24:20,101
Damn you!

1201
01:24:20,101 --> 01:24:21,686
I love you.

1202
01:24:21,978 --> 01:24:23,229
Damn it!

1203
01:24:23,229 --> 01:24:23,855
I love you.

1204
01:24:23,855 --> 01:24:26,358
I love you. I love you. I love you.

1205
01:24:26,358 --> 01:24:27,609
I hate you!

1206
01:24:27,609 --> 01:24:29,444
Fuck me. Fuck me.

1207
01:24:29,486 --> 01:24:30,987
Fuck you!

1208
01:24:33,865 --> 01:24:35,450
I love you.

1209
01:24:35,742 --> 01:24:36,368
I'm pregnant.

1210
01:24:36,368 --> 01:24:38,244
My goldfish died.

1211
01:24:38,244 --> 01:24:39,496
My hamster died.

1212
01:24:39,496 --> 01:24:40,747
My father's dying.

1213
01:24:40,747 --> 01:24:42,457
I'm pregnant.

1214
01:25:02,018 --> 01:25:04,187
Maybe we should separate.

1215
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:45,103
Mom! Dad!

1216
01:25:45,437 --> 01:25:46,980
You ready?

1217
01:25:51,693 --> 01:25:54,154
What's up? It's good to see you.

1218
01:25:54,195 --> 01:25:55,905
How you doing?

1219
01:25:57,323 --> 01:25:58,575
What's the matter?

1220
01:25:58,575 --> 01:26:01,077
She just missed you, that's all.

1221
01:26:01,077 --> 01:26:03,496
You've both just grown so big.

1222
01:26:03,580 --> 01:26:06,708
Look at you guys.
I hardly recognize you. Wait.

1223
01:26:07,334 --> 01:26:09,210
Which one is Erin?

1224
01:26:09,210 --> 01:26:11,129
Check it out, Dad.

1225
01:26:11,713 --> 01:26:15,467
I guess we know what your high
is today". Best All-Around Camper".

1226
01:26:15,467 --> 01:26:17,344
Congratulations. Look.

1227
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:20,930
I guess this calls for a celebration!
Come on! Riverdance!

1228
01:26:21,097 --> 01:26:23,683
I'm the best all-around Riverdancer

1229
01:26:24,225 --> 01:26:27,687
Come on. Kind of like
a little "Latin Lupe Lu" thing.

1230
01:26:27,979 --> 01:26:30,065
Go with the big finish!

1231
01:26:30,482 --> 01:26:31,733
Come on! What?

1232
01:26:31,733 --> 01:26:35,528
- I have to see these kids next summer.
- Come on, we' re hungry.

1233
01:26:36,112 --> 01:26:37,906
Okay. All right.

1234
01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:45,330
Let's go home.

1235
01:26:58,009 --> 01:27:00,595
I think we should go to Chow Fun's.

1236
01:27:08,645 --> 01:27:10,230
Chow Fun's?

1237
01:27:12,399 --> 01:27:15,485
We agreed that we
couldn't talk at Chow Fun's.

1238
01:27:15,527 --> 01:27:16,945
I know.

1239
01:27:18,655 --> 01:27:19,906
What are you saying?

1240
01:27:19,906 --> 01:27:21,991
I'm saying Chow Fun's.

1241
01:27:26,162 --> 01:27:29,916
Are you saying Chow Fun's
because you can't face telling them?

1242
01:27:29,916 --> 01:27:32,419
If that's why, don't say Chow Fun's.

1243
01:27:32,419 --> 01:27:36,256
That's not why. I' m saying Chow Fun's
because we' re an "us".

1244
01:27:38,049 --> 01:27:40,301
There's a history here...

1245
01:27:40,552 --> 01:27:43,471
and histories
don't happen overnight.

1246
01:27:44,305 --> 01:27:46,182
In Mesopotamia or ancient Troy...

1247
01:27:46,182 --> 01:27:50,228
or somewhere, there are cities
built on top of other cities...

1248
01:27:50,562 --> 01:27:53,690
but I don't wanna build
another city. I like this city.

1249
01:27:53,690 --> 01:27:55,567
I know where we keep the Bactine...

1250
01:27:55,567 --> 01:27:59,112
and what mood you' re in
by which eyebrow is higher.

1251
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:03,575
You always know that I' m quiet in
the morning and compensate accordingly.

1252
01:28:04,325 --> 01:28:06,995
That's a dance you perfect over time.

1253
01:28:07,454 --> 01:28:10,582
And it's much harder
than I thought it would be...

1254
01:28:10,582 --> 01:28:14,502
but there's more good than bad.
And you don't just give up!

1255
01:28:14,961 --> 01:28:17,464
And it's not for the sake
of the children.

1256
01:28:17,464 --> 01:28:19,966
But they' re great kids, aren't they?

1257
01:28:19,966 --> 01:28:22,469
And we made them!
I mean, think about that.

1258
01:28:22,469 --> 01:28:25,930
There were no people there,
and then there were people.

1259
01:28:26,222 --> 01:28:28,099
And then they grew.

1260
01:28:28,099 --> 01:28:32,103
I won't be able to say to some
stranger, "Josh has your hands"...

1261
01:28:32,479 --> 01:28:36,232
or "Remember how Erin threw up
at the Lincoln Memorial?"

1262
01:28:36,232 --> 01:28:38,276
And I'll try to relax.

1263
01:28:39,986 --> 01:28:43,823
Let's face it, anybody will have
traits that get on your nerves.

1264
01:28:44,366 --> 01:28:48,119
Why shouldn't it be your annoying
traits? I' m no day at the beach.

1265
01:28:48,119 --> 01:28:51,873
But I do have a good sense
of direction, so I can find the beach.

1266
01:28:51,873 --> 01:28:54,584
Which is not a criticism of yours...

1267
01:28:55,627 --> 01:28:58,129
it's just a strength of mine.

1268
01:28:58,129 --> 01:29:01,966
God, you' re a good friend.
And good friends are hard to find.

1269
01:29:04,386 --> 01:29:06,888
Charlotte said that
in Charlotte 's Web.

1270
01:29:06,888 --> 01:29:08,765
I love the way you read that to Erin.

1271
01:29:08,765 --> 01:29:12,310
You take on the voice of Wilbur
with such commitment...

1272
01:29:12,519 --> 01:29:14,396
even when you' re bone tired.

1273
01:29:14,396 --> 01:29:17,899
That speaks volumes about character.
And ultimately...

1274
01:29:18,775 --> 01:29:22,529
isn't that what it comes down to?
What a person's made of?

1275
01:29:22,529 --> 01:29:25,407
Because that girl
in the pith helmet...

1276
01:29:26,282 --> 01:29:28,326
is still in here.

1277
01:29:31,287 --> 01:29:34,416
I didn't even know she existed
until I met you.

1278
01:29:34,416 --> 01:29:36,918
And I' m afraid if you leave...

1279
01:29:37,544 --> 01:29:39,421
I may never see her again.

1280
01:29:39,421 --> 01:29:43,341
Even though I said you beat her
out of me. Isn't that the paradox?

1281
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:47,554
Haven't we hit the essential paradox?
Give and take, push and pull.

1282
01:29:47,554 --> 01:29:50,682
The best of times, the worst of times.
Dickens said it best.

1283
01:29:50,682 --> 01:29:54,436
The Jack Sprat of it. He could eat
no fat. His wife could eat no lean.

1284
01:29:54,436 --> 01:29:58,815
But that doesn't apply here, does it?
I guess what I' m trying to say is...

1285
01:30:00,066 --> 01:30:02,902
I' m saying Chow Fun's because...

1286
01:30:03,194 --> 01:30:05,030
I love you.

1287
01:30:14,456 --> 01:30:16,207
I love you too.

1288
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:25,216
Did you hear that, kids?

1289
01:30:25,216 --> 01:30:27,802
Your mom wants to go to Chow Fun's!

1290
01:30:28,970 --> 01:30:31,639
Isn't that great?
I love Chow Fun's!

1291
01:30:32,098 --> 01:30:34,601
The egg rolls are good,
but not that good.

1292
01:30:34,601 --> 01:30:36,895
The egg rolls are fantastic!

1293
01:30:37,103 --> 01:30:39,606
They' re warm, crispy,
greasy as all hell.

1294
01:30:39,606 --> 01:30:42,734
- Everything you want in an egg roll!
- Exactly!

1295
01:30:42,734 --> 01:30:43,985
High/Low. Erin, you first.

1296
01:30:43,985 --> 01:30:47,113
My high for the summer is,
Austin wrote me!!! times.

1297
01:30:47,113 --> 01:30:50,033
How did you come up
with High/Low anyway?

1298
01:30:50,241 --> 01:30:52,744
I don 't know.
But I've got another game.

1299
01:30:52,744 --> 01:30:55,747
I'm thinking of seven words.
What are they?

1300
01:30:55,872 --> 01:30:57,665
Do I get a hint?

1301
01:30:57,749 --> 01:30:59,000
A category?

1302
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,961
- Any seven words in English.
- That's right.

1303
01:31:02,128 --> 01:31:03,755
Fair enough.

1304
01:31:04,631 --> 01:31:07,550
"MacArthur Park is melting
in the dark".

1305
01:31:10,887 --> 01:31:13,556
"And they lived happlly ever after".

1306
01:31:14,641 --> 01:31:17,519
That's six words,
but you' re very close.

1307
01:31:18,395 --> 01:31:21,398
"And they lived mostly happlly
ever after"?

1308
01:31:22,774 --> 01:31:24,317
I hope so.

1309
01:31:24,651 --> 01:31:26,236
I think so.

1310
01:31:28,405 --> 01:31:29,656
Think so?

1311
01:31:29,656 --> 01:31:30,990
I do.

1312
01:31:32,784 --> 01:31:34,035
I do...

1313
01:31:34,035 --> 01:31:35,537
too.
