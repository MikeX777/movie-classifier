1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,041
25.000

2
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,963
The model's on a scale of 1/25,

3
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,799
but has to be imagined life-size.

4
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,933
The walls will be lined
with insulation.

5
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,815
Lighting will be permanent.
No switches.

6
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:08,651
I'll also have a mechanism

7
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:10,612
to slowly rotate the whole.

8
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,697
So while I'm sleeping,

9
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:15,742
when my brain's stopped,
my body still moves.

10
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,578
The brain doesn't stop
during sleep, Mr Keller.

11
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,789
Just a manner of speaking.

12
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:25,251
But how'd you define it?
Is it a cell?

13
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:29,047
A shelter?
A crypt, perhaps?

14
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:32,842
As it doesn't exist,

15
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,178
I don't know what you'd call it.

16
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,474
A way of shutting out
the world, no?

17
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,226
Maybe...

18
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,813
In any case, the world...

19
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,356
Yes?

20
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,150
The world?

21
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:54,155
So, what's your motivation
for this work?

22
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,449
I can't do anything else.

23
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,203
And, the modules,
in particular...

24
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,456
Why white?

25
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,753
I dunno, I like white.

26
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,257
I like silence,
things well done.

27
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,637
Outside,
I find all is dirty, mediocre.

28
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:23,643
There, you could gaze at the wall
for days, and after, maybe talk.

29
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,603
It might be possible.

30
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,694
If beauty comes
we need a place to greet it.

31
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,572
If we don't prepare
nothing can happen.

32
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:44,039
That's more or less
what I've always done.

33
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:49,085
I used to enclose objects
in white-painted boxes,

34
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,255
wrapped in cotton-wool.

35
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:59,637
Now I'm sick of boxes.
I want something big.

36
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,766
In which to put what?

37
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,065
Something beautiful.

38
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,350
Bruno!

39
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,483
What the hell is this?

40
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,403
Don't take my plastic
for your fucking car.

41
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,490
What's this fucking mess?

42
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,203
What should rot outside.
Not my stuff!

43
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,455
Are you crazy?

44
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,707
That's the best of furniture!

45
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,794
Top quality workmanship!

46
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,756
They don't make furniture
like that anymore.

47
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:41,424
I hope not.

48
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,427
Hope not...

49
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,805
Open this door.

50
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:48,723
Bruno!

51
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:58,942
Mind your tongue!

52
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:03,113
That was my father's furniture,
made to measure, saved hard for.

53
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,907
So put it back
where it fucking belongs!

54
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:26,042
You're eating late.

55
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,336
Yeah, a lot of work.

56
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,887
Don't want to know
how your father is?

57
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,688
Need the bag?

58
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,149
- What?
- Can I take it?

59
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,975
What's all this?

60
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,940
Might I know what's going on?

61
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:42,192
Nothing.

62
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,778
I just changed my mind.

63
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:49,657
I was getting pissed off
with the models.

64
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,076
And so?

65
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,287
So, nothing.

66
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,503
This'll be my third-year project.

67
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:05,590
But I'd just like to...

68
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:09,302
add one last little touch...

69
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:14,516
It'll be called:
"Wet Summer, Wet Paint"!

70
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:17,227
Did you ask for permission
to do this?

71
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,398
Where'll your classmates work?

72
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,276
- Dunno.
- You don't know.

73
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,779
Are you out of your mind,
or what?

74
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:32,575
You just cleared
their work out without...

75
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:37,455
Listen, Bruno,
this may be a "Fine Arts" school,

76
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:40,166
but that's just not on.

77
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:43,336
Already, you swan in and out
as you like.

78
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,297
You prepare projects
and then you...

79
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:48,633
I what?

80
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,719
My idea's still the same.

81
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:54,222
Sorry, but we can't let you do
just anything.

82
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,351
This isn't just anything.

83
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:02,022
Look, if you continue,
they'll expel you.

84
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,565
You understand?

85
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,820
Yeah, I understand.

86
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,657
You're not alone.

87
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:34,095
I'm through.

88
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,140
I'm outta here.

89
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,768
You don't have to take it
like that.

90
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,603
I'm out,
that's what you want.

91
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:44,189
We never asked you...

92
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:47,942
to be... a model pupil.

93
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:51,154
I'm outta here,
that way everyone'll be happy!

94
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:52,906
It's a put-on.

95
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:55,450
You like it too much.

96
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,578
A put-on?

97
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:05,835
I've no money,

98
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:07,671
no home,

99
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,507
no one to help me...
Call that a put-on?

100
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:20,308
I don't know what to say...

101
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,648
Maybe it's better that way.

102
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:31,236
But if you need money,
I may have a solution.

103
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:35,699
Landscape gardening,
a bit of interior decoration...

104
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:38,743
Pays well...
But it's up to you.

105
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:40,912
I can put in a word.

106
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:35,842
Enough!

107
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:37,927
That's enough!

108
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:47,896
Where's the furniture?

109
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,231
What furniture?

110
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:52,525
What'd you do with it?

111
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:56,863
That furniture
had to be taken apart

112
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,741
to get it in there,
now where is it?

113
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:00,658
Yeah, I know the story.

114
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,494
Now get off my back.

115
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,746
Don't piss me about, Bruno.

116
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:07,916
If you sold that furniture
I'll call the cops.

117
00:20:12,587 --> 00:20:14,089
Fuck and damn!

118
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:17,550
To hell with your furniture!

119
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:20,345
It sucked, made me wanna puke.

120
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,348
You little shit!

121
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:39,989
Little shit!

122
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:56,548
I want you outta here.

123
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:02,512
Do you hear me?

124
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:05,432
I want you fucking out,
as of tomorrow!

125
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:08,143
Who'll put me out, you?

126
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:11,187
Me, and the cops, if need be.

127
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:26,036
Cheers.

128
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:20,103
You swine!

129
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,023
Take that back!
You take it back!

130
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:27,110
Let me go, you bastard,
all you can do is hit!

131
00:25:27,277 --> 00:25:31,114
Know what I did
with your lousy jewelry?

132
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:32,991
Me and Raymond went whoring!

133
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:35,952
We had our dicks sucked
by a prize hooker!

134
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:37,203
Bastard!

135
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:40,582
Know what it means
to suck dick?

136
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,751
- You pig!
- Filthy bitch!

137
00:25:47,756 --> 00:25:48,840
What's going on?

138
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:51,676
You shut it, brother-in-law!

139
00:25:51,843 --> 00:25:53,386
Get back in your room.

140
00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:57,140
Do you hear that slut?
The fucking nerve!

141
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:00,310
This here is my home.

142
00:26:00,477 --> 00:26:02,270
You don't like,
beat it!

143
00:26:02,437 --> 00:26:04,564
- No, I don't like it.
- Then ship out!

144
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:06,691
I don't like it one bit!

145
00:26:06,858 --> 00:26:07,776
Pick that up!

146
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:10,904
Shut your fucking mouth,
crazy bitch!

147
00:26:14,783 --> 00:26:15,700
Yeah, beat it!

148
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:17,160
The Keller brothers,

149
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:20,288
two bloody alcoholics!

150
00:26:20,872 --> 00:26:24,793
So who'd want you, bitch?
You stink of drink!

151
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:30,382
It was me who started this?

152
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:33,301
Who was picked out of the gutter
at 4 a.m.?

153
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:35,345
Who was it? Who?

154
00:26:35,553 --> 00:26:38,723
You bloody drunks!

155
00:26:38,932 --> 00:26:42,769
She hits the sauce
at nine every morning!

156
00:26:57,534 --> 00:27:01,121
What's your fucking brat
up to now?

157
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:04,666
I'm out of here!

158
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:06,918
I'm leaving!

159
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:10,547
Go ahead and fucking leave,
bitch!

160
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:13,717
I'll go get the cops,
you hear?

161
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:15,593
That's what I'll do.

162
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:47,292
April 1992

163
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:51,755
My name is Elise Gardet,
I'm 7 years old.

164
00:27:51,963 --> 00:27:55,550
My name is Elise Gardet,
I'm 7 years old.

165
00:27:55,842 --> 00:27:57,886
Follow the light with your eyes.

166
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:02,724
That's right.

167
00:28:04,142 --> 00:28:06,019
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

168
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:08,938
So tell me about that day.
Where are you?

169
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:10,607
I'm in my room.

170
00:28:10,774 --> 00:28:12,817
Follow the light with your eyes.

171
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,737
You're in your room?

172
00:28:16,488 --> 00:28:17,489
Yes.

173
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:19,574
Your mom, is she with you?

174
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:20,658
No.

175
00:28:41,846 --> 00:28:43,723
So tell me what you see.

176
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:50,313
I see his car...

177
00:28:51,064 --> 00:28:51,898
It's blue.

178
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:56,444
No, red.

179
00:28:57,445 --> 00:28:58,988
It's red.

180
00:28:59,406 --> 00:29:01,032
Red? Are you sure?

181
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,535
Yes, red.

182
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:04,994
Stay with that.

183
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,346
Is he there?

184
00:29:23,513 --> 00:29:24,764
Yes.

185
00:29:25,015 --> 00:29:26,474
He's come inside?

186
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,309
What's he doing?

187
00:29:29,144 --> 00:29:30,937
I don't know.

188
00:29:32,564 --> 00:29:33,940
He's shouting.

189
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:36,985
Do you know why he's shouting?

190
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:43,825
Breathe deeply.

191
00:29:46,077 --> 00:29:48,204
What's happening now?
Where are you?

192
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:49,998
In the corridor.

193
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:52,834
Stay with that.

194
00:31:11,121 --> 00:31:13,790
- What are you doing?
- I'm hiding.

195
00:31:14,165 --> 00:31:16,042
Where? In your room?

196
00:31:17,085 --> 00:31:19,212
No, in the bathroom.

197
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:22,048
What are you feeling?
Are you hot, cold?

198
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,717
No...

199
00:31:24,342 --> 00:31:26,720
And the man,
can you see him?

200
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:28,638
What's he doing?

201
00:31:32,267 --> 00:31:34,477
I don't remember.

202
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,313
Concentrate, Elise.

203
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,193
He's crying.

204
00:31:42,777 --> 00:31:44,195
He's crying?

205
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:45,947
Yes.

206
00:31:46,865 --> 00:31:48,324
Stay with that.

207
00:32:39,626 --> 00:32:40,877
And then?

208
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,254
He left.

209
00:32:59,604 --> 00:33:00,939
She's better.

210
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,860
More attentive,

211
00:33:06,653 --> 00:33:08,947
willing too,
but it'll be long.

212
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:11,533
I know.

213
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:15,036
How do you intend...

214
00:33:15,662 --> 00:33:19,082
Think you'll have enough time
to devote to her?

215
00:33:22,836 --> 00:33:24,546
If you feel you need to talk,

216
00:33:25,797 --> 00:33:29,050
any fears, questions,
whatever, feel free.

217
00:33:31,428 --> 00:33:33,054
It's important to talk,

218
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:36,975
because it's important for Elise.

219
00:33:37,267 --> 00:33:39,060
And for me,
to make progress.

220
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:40,520
Yes, I understand.

221
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:42,355
I thank you.

222
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,774
But I'm okay...

223
00:33:46,651 --> 00:33:49,112
So far, I'm bearing up.

224
00:33:49,988 --> 00:33:51,156
Fine.

225
00:33:52,407 --> 00:33:55,577
I also wanted to say,
though this doesn't depend on you...

226
00:33:56,911 --> 00:33:59,998
But as long as the killer
is at large

227
00:34:00,165 --> 00:34:02,959
Elise won't rest easy.
You understand?

228
00:34:05,962 --> 00:34:08,798
- Had any news about the...
- Yes.

229
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:11,384
The target was
a certain Doctor Gardet.

230
00:34:11,593 --> 00:34:12,969
Gardet? Like you?

231
00:34:14,804 --> 00:34:17,891
He lives quite near us,
I even went to see him.

232
00:34:18,933 --> 00:34:20,268
Yes, I know...

233
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:26,149
A shady doctor, say the cops. Bogus
prescriptions, a lot of cash...

234
00:34:28,068 --> 00:34:32,280
I've a PhD in nuclear physics,
so I put "Doctor" in the directory.

235
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:37,243
The cops reckon
the murderer mixed us up.

236
00:34:39,621 --> 00:34:41,331
Obviously some junkie.

237
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:45,168
It seems so...

238
00:35:38,388 --> 00:35:40,265
You don't know what it's like.

239
00:35:40,807 --> 00:35:42,600
No one does.

240
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:46,479
Those who haven't been through it
just don't know.

241
00:35:47,647 --> 00:35:50,358
- I think I can imagine.
- You can't.

242
00:35:51,276 --> 00:35:54,946
I too lost the woman I loved
in difficult circumstances.

243
00:35:58,366 --> 00:36:01,369
- But I didn't come to talk of...
- They suspected me.

244
00:36:08,209 --> 00:36:10,253
So, you're my alibi?

245
00:36:13,506 --> 00:36:15,550
Didn't picture you like that.

246
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:19,846
- How then?
- I don't know.

247
00:36:23,475 --> 00:36:25,685
I thank you
for what you've done.

248
00:36:26,603 --> 00:36:29,147
If you'd not seen me
on the train that day...

249
00:36:30,774 --> 00:36:32,901
You'd have done the same for me.

250
00:36:33,193 --> 00:36:36,780
No, you saw me,
but I'd never have noticed you.

251
00:36:37,614 --> 00:36:40,158
I take that train every day and...

252
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:43,703
Seems I've still a lot to learn.

253
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:45,914
No, it's nothing.

254
00:36:46,623 --> 00:36:49,501
Don't let such things get to you.

255
00:36:51,961 --> 00:36:54,089
I think your daughter wants you.

256
00:36:58,468 --> 00:36:59,719
Number 1.

257
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:03,098
Okay, number 2.

258
00:37:05,558 --> 00:37:06,810
Number 4.

259
00:37:08,311 --> 00:37:09,312
Again.

260
00:37:09,562 --> 00:37:10,647
It's him.

261
00:37:11,272 --> 00:37:12,107
Number 1?

262
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:14,275
No, it's him...

263
00:37:17,612 --> 00:37:19,072
He's the same.

264
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:20,657
Who's the same?

265
00:37:21,574 --> 00:37:23,201
Who's the same, pet?

266
00:37:23,368 --> 00:37:24,744
He's the same.

267
00:37:25,495 --> 00:37:27,122
This is pointless.

268
00:37:28,832 --> 00:37:30,375
Happy? Now what?

269
00:37:30,542 --> 00:37:32,168
What else can we do?

270
00:37:34,671 --> 00:37:37,215
- That's enough!
- There, see?

271
00:37:39,134 --> 00:37:41,011
It's easy to know who she is.

272
00:37:42,595 --> 00:37:43,930
Dead easy.

273
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:46,975
11 YEARS LATER

274
00:38:22,886 --> 00:38:25,347
I think it's better like that.

275
00:38:27,098 --> 00:38:28,892
I'll remove the hook.

276
00:38:29,225 --> 00:38:30,477
Yes, that's nice.

277
00:38:31,353 --> 00:38:34,439
- Very nice. Like it?
- Yes, lovely.

278
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:44,282
How is that?

279
00:39:24,948 --> 00:39:26,199
Elise?

280
00:39:27,617 --> 00:39:29,035
Elise!

281
00:39:29,703 --> 00:39:32,080
Could you fetch madam
the beige ones?

282
00:39:41,297 --> 00:39:42,716
How's that?

283
00:39:43,717 --> 00:39:45,593
A little higher.

284
00:39:54,144 --> 00:39:55,562
And there?

285
00:39:58,356 --> 00:40:00,233
A bit higher on the right.

286
00:40:04,237 --> 00:40:05,488
Don't move.

287
00:40:11,786 --> 00:40:13,747
Did you do the photos?

288
00:40:13,913 --> 00:40:16,750
No, just the hanging.
Like it?

289
00:42:02,981 --> 00:42:04,566
What's your name?

290
00:42:05,233 --> 00:42:07,694
My name's Elise Gardet.
I'm 18 years old.

291
00:42:09,988 --> 00:42:11,489
Can I call you?

292
00:42:14,034 --> 00:42:15,035
Okay.

293
00:43:09,798 --> 00:43:12,008
Who's speaking?

294
00:43:14,761 --> 00:43:16,888
I can't hear you.

295
00:44:14,696 --> 00:44:16,740
- "Is Elise there?"
- Who's speaking?

296
00:44:20,285 --> 00:44:23,288
- "Is she there or not?"
- What for? Who are you?

297
00:44:27,042 --> 00:44:28,752
Are you calling
from that car?

298
00:45:18,551 --> 00:45:20,595
Who are you?
What're you doing?

299
00:45:20,845 --> 00:45:23,598
- Waiting for the bus.
- Nonsense, I saw you.

300
00:45:25,058 --> 00:45:27,602
Three buses have already passed!

301
00:45:28,561 --> 00:45:29,646
Really?

302
00:46:00,093 --> 00:46:02,846
Still here in 5 minutes
I'll call the police.

303
00:46:03,304 --> 00:46:05,098
Go ahead, call them.

304
00:46:06,182 --> 00:46:07,809
I will, I'm warning you.

305
00:46:10,103 --> 00:46:11,896
Why don't you just piss off?

306
00:46:29,706 --> 00:46:32,459
{y:i}This is your local police...

307
00:46:38,673 --> 00:46:39,841
{y:i}Hello, Police.

308
00:46:52,687 --> 00:46:54,022
Anne...

309
00:46:58,693 --> 00:47:01,071
Why do you feel
constantly watched?

310
00:47:02,906 --> 00:47:04,783
- Is she asleep?
- Yes.

311
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:10,747
I really love her, you know.

312
00:47:10,997 --> 00:47:12,082
I know.

313
00:47:15,543 --> 00:47:18,797
I feel watched,
because someone's always watching.

314
00:47:19,005 --> 00:47:21,966
You must stop thinking that.
He won't return.

315
00:47:22,175 --> 00:47:23,760
Not 11 years after.

316
00:47:30,058 --> 00:47:32,769
He's most likely dead
of an overdose.

317
00:47:34,354 --> 00:47:35,855
Yes, true.

318
00:47:40,443 --> 00:47:42,237
Him, perhaps.
But the others?

319
00:47:43,029 --> 00:47:44,197
What others?

320
00:47:55,792 --> 00:47:59,212
{y:i}For years, Anne believed
{y:i}the killer would return.

321
00:48:00,714 --> 00:48:03,383
{y:i}For me.
{y:i}To look for me.

322
00:48:04,759 --> 00:48:06,219
{y:i}She trusted no one.

323
00:48:06,594 --> 00:48:08,888
{y:i}She chose my school, my friends,

324
00:48:10,598 --> 00:48:13,560
{y:i}what I should read, watch, eat.

325
00:48:14,227 --> 00:48:18,606
{y:i}She says men are dangerous
{y:i}and that I'm fragile.

326
00:48:19,107 --> 00:48:22,694
{y:i}But I'm sick of it,
{y:i}sick of being protected,

327
00:48:23,695 --> 00:48:25,739
{y:i}of not being allowed to forget.

328
00:48:31,661 --> 00:48:33,288
{y:i}I met him yesterday.

329
00:48:34,622 --> 00:48:39,002
{y:i}For him, I'm not a victim,
{y:i}a child to be protected,

330
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:42,464
{y:i}I'm simply there.

331
00:48:43,214 --> 00:48:46,968
{y:i}I am as I am
{y:i}and that's enough for him.

332
00:48:48,053 --> 00:48:50,597
{y:i}For me, that's all that matters.

333
00:48:54,642 --> 00:48:58,480
{y:i}Anne thinks I meet Marion
{y:i}at lunchtimes.

334
00:48:59,773 --> 00:49:04,402
{y:i}If she knew I were seeing him,
{y:i}God knows what she might do.

335
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,408
It's beautiful.

336
00:49:11,117 --> 00:49:12,369
Yeah, it's nice.

337
00:49:14,037 --> 00:49:16,414
But don't look at what's in it.

338
00:49:17,082 --> 00:49:18,792
You need to see it empty.

339
00:49:20,752 --> 00:49:23,546
For the light, the space,

340
00:49:24,255 --> 00:49:26,049
all this whiteness.

341
00:49:29,969 --> 00:49:32,097
When it's empty,
I'll be here.

342
00:50:19,728 --> 00:50:21,187
Why are you doing that?

343
00:50:57,015 --> 00:50:59,851
{y:i}Yesterday,
{y:i}he took me up Castle Hill.

344
00:51:04,773 --> 00:51:06,983
{y:i}He told me
{y:i}each tree is a world

345
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:09,444
{y:i}and between each world,
{y:i}lies water.

346
00:51:15,825 --> 00:51:18,536
{y:i}That one day he'd teach me
{y:i}to swim between the trees.

347
00:53:03,725 --> 00:53:06,353
{y:i}Taking his hand,
{y:i}he was trembling.

348
00:53:06,519 --> 00:53:09,064
{y:i}He said it wasn't death
{y:i}which scared him

349
00:53:09,272 --> 00:53:13,735
{y:i}but that glut of bodies in the
{y:i}earth, which the earth doesn't want.

350
00:55:51,643 --> 00:55:53,436
{y:i}Sunday again.

351
00:55:57,315 --> 00:55:58,900
{y:i}Stuck at home again.

352
00:55:59,693 --> 00:56:01,111
{y:i}Bored again.

353
00:56:03,029 --> 00:56:04,823
{y:i}Thought a lot of Bruno.

354
00:56:06,991 --> 00:56:08,076
{y:i}All the time.

355
00:56:11,496 --> 00:56:12,872
{y:i}Of what he said to me.

356
00:56:19,713 --> 00:56:21,256
I was proud,

357
00:56:21,589 --> 00:56:23,383
vain and dumb...

358
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:25,051
That's all.

359
00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:31,683
I felt I was succeeding,
yet I was fucking up my life.

360
00:56:33,601 --> 00:56:35,562
I only realize that now.

361
00:56:37,522 --> 00:56:39,065
Why did I do that?

362
00:56:42,527 --> 00:56:45,363
Why did I have to tag "Doctor"
onto my name?

363
00:56:50,994 --> 00:56:54,164
You think it's normal
I still feel guilty?

364
00:56:56,499 --> 00:56:59,252
Anyone'd feel guilty
in your situation.

365
00:57:00,462 --> 00:57:03,965
Like it or not, it was you
who led that man to your home.

366
00:57:04,215 --> 00:57:05,675
You led him there.

367
00:57:06,593 --> 00:57:10,096
So, call it vanity, arrogance,

368
00:57:11,139 --> 00:57:12,932
whatever you will...

369
00:57:13,183 --> 00:57:17,020
your wife is dead,
and that...

370
00:57:21,024 --> 00:57:25,403
Where our acts lead, we know not.
If we did, we'd do nothing.

371
00:57:25,612 --> 00:57:28,490
But as that's no solution,
we get up, we do,

372
00:57:29,449 --> 00:57:32,619
only each time striving
to be a bit more careful.

373
00:57:32,911 --> 00:57:35,663
We reflect,
try to behave correctly.

374
00:57:36,748 --> 00:57:39,209
Avoiding the seven deadly sins?

375
00:57:40,335 --> 00:57:42,295
Why not? Perhaps.

376
00:57:44,172 --> 00:57:45,757
In any case,

377
00:57:46,424 --> 00:57:48,802
a tragedy like this shows us

378
00:57:49,844 --> 00:57:53,682
why Vanity is one of them.
Don't you think?

379
00:57:55,475 --> 00:57:57,686
Your daughter's asleep.
Is she staying?

380
00:57:57,977 --> 00:57:59,145
Okay.

381
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:08,405
{y:i}He said he'd a place for me
{y:i}in his project.

382
00:58:10,323 --> 00:58:12,117
{y:i}I think those were his words.

383
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:25,547
What're you doing?
Not well?

384
00:58:34,222 --> 00:58:37,892
Why's everyone leaving?
Whose place is this?

385
00:58:38,935 --> 00:58:40,311
Belongs to Italians.

386
00:58:40,478 --> 00:58:42,939
Folks with money to burn.

387
00:58:44,566 --> 00:58:47,986
They only use it 2 months a year.
What a waste!

388
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:52,157
Why don't you use it?
You have the keys.

389
00:58:52,574 --> 00:58:54,951
I would, if I were you.

390
00:58:57,787 --> 00:58:59,414
Finished up at the shop?

391
00:59:00,832 --> 00:59:02,459
Yeah.

392
00:59:03,335 --> 00:59:06,671
This door will be walled over,
to put shelving here,

393
00:59:06,838 --> 00:59:08,089
here...

394
00:59:08,256 --> 00:59:12,010
I'm no stone mason.
And shelves will look dead ugly.

395
00:59:13,428 --> 00:59:15,305
Should leave these walls empty.

396
00:59:16,348 --> 00:59:18,892
Sorry, Bruno,
but no one asked you.

397
00:59:19,059 --> 00:59:22,479
The owners want this walled up,
so that's that.

398
00:59:24,147 --> 00:59:25,690
Are you listening?

399
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,777
Easy does it!

400
00:59:37,702 --> 00:59:40,080
That's it.
Right, heave away!

401
00:59:44,918 --> 00:59:46,711
Kamel, bring the truck!

402
01:00:13,988 --> 01:00:16,449
So are you doing this job?
Yes or no?

403
01:04:27,158 --> 01:04:28,785
You sleep naked now?

404
01:04:31,413 --> 01:04:32,747
You're pathetic...

405
01:04:34,624 --> 01:04:35,709
Dress, you'll be late.

406
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:57,313
She knows it's you.

407
01:04:57,647 --> 01:04:58,898
Who?

408
01:04:59,190 --> 01:05:02,360
In the shop.
She says you're a dirty thief.

409
01:05:03,194 --> 01:05:04,988
Why dirty?
I'm not dirty.

410
01:05:07,824 --> 01:05:10,910
Even if you were,
it'd be all the same to me.

411
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:26,051
Perfect.

412
01:05:36,478 --> 01:05:38,271
No, Elise, don't get in!

413
01:05:39,147 --> 01:05:40,940
It's filthy inside.

414
01:05:41,316 --> 01:05:43,109
I'm not walking home.

415
01:05:45,236 --> 01:05:46,863
Come on, out!

416
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:50,575
- It's not my car.
- I'm cold, I wanna go home.

417
01:05:51,159 --> 01:05:52,327
- Come on.
- I'm late!

418
01:05:52,535 --> 01:05:55,413
It's not mine,
we'll take the bus.

419
01:06:00,752 --> 01:06:01,836
Come on!

420
01:08:22,727 --> 01:08:23,895
Kamel?

421
01:08:37,325 --> 01:08:39,536
Sorry, didn't know you were here.

422
01:08:39,786 --> 01:08:41,830
Bruno, what're you doing here?

423
01:08:42,038 --> 01:08:43,540
I came by to work.

424
01:08:44,499 --> 01:08:47,127
- But I'll be on my way.
- What's going on?

425
01:08:47,293 --> 01:08:49,004
- You've no business here.
- Sorry...

426
01:08:49,671 --> 01:08:51,631
I just felt like working.

427
01:08:52,090 --> 01:08:53,550
Up you go. I'll be off.

428
01:08:53,717 --> 01:08:55,510
Have you stolen something?

429
01:08:55,719 --> 01:08:58,596
No, nothing.
I just came by to work.

430
01:08:59,055 --> 01:09:00,223
Then let me pass.

431
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:01,850
Let go of me!

432
01:09:02,892 --> 01:09:04,477
Just go back upstairs.

433
01:09:05,478 --> 01:09:07,188
Back upstairs, please...

434
01:09:08,314 --> 01:09:10,191
Please, go back up.

435
01:09:12,777 --> 01:09:14,029
Let go of me...

436
01:09:14,279 --> 01:09:15,905
Go upstairs.
I'm leaving.
