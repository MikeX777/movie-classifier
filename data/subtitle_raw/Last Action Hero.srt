2
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:17,517
I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:13,365
This is one hell of a way
to spend Christmas.

4
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:16,618
- Mulcahey!
- Sir.

5
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:22,832
Secure the sidewalk.
No one gets in or out.

6
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:45,647
{y:i}I have a present for you!
{y:i}Pigs!

7
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:56,700
Let the children go!
Damn you, Ripper!

8
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,477
Slater!!

9
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:30,191
Do no even think it, Slater.
Wait for the hostage negotiator.

10
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:33,028
Goddamn it, Jack,
I am talking to you!

11
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:36,906
The last time you pulled this
jive, jitterbug, tough gonad shit -

12
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,784
- people lost bodyparts!

13
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:45,290
If you go in there,
you will lose your badge!

14
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,792
Jack, as Mayor of this city, -

15
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:51,796
- you and I have had our tiffs,
but this is the Lieutenant Governor.

16
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:56,468
- When the Governor gets here, call me.
- Do not let Slater in.

17
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,929
Repeat: Do not let him in!

18
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,766
Piece of cake.

19
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:07,979
Do you want to be a farmer?
Here is a couple of acres.

20
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:14,569
- Dekker, the next one I will hurt.
{y:i}- Slater, do not go in there!

21
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:24,579
Check fire. There is a plain-clothes
officer in the building.

22
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:32,087
- Jack, what kept you?
- Dad!

23
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:40,011
Andy is getting nervous.
I promised him you would come.

24
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:47,060
I gave him my word he could
watch you die. Lose the cannon.

25
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,606
Has he hurt you, Andrew?

26
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:57,028
Did you say hurt, Jack?
What do you know about hurt?

27
00:03:57,278 --> 00:04:02,367
- You put me in a cage for ten years.
- You deserved the death penalty.

28
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,328
Yes, whatever.

29
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:10,166
Things crawl around in my head
and sit on my chest when I wake up.

30
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:13,420
Do you know what it is like?

31
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:20,677
Your illegal search rendered
the bloody axe inadmissable. Remember?

32
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:25,015
Now lose the gun.

33
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:38,528
All right, I am unarmed.
Let the boy go.

34
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:44,951
Just one gun, Jack?
You must be kidding.

35
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:10,268
- Is that all, sport?
- Yes, that about does it.

36
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:13,938
Then step away.

37
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,860
Chop-chop.

38
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:25,367
Unless you consider this a weapon.

39
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:37,003
Brilliant, Jack. Brilliant.
I surrender.

40
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,673
- That is a live grenade.
- Sure.

41
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:45,804
You will sacrifice your son to get me.
I am flattered, but I doubt it.

42
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:51,726
Andy, pick up the grenade.
Go on.

43
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:59,192
Show it to me.

44
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:09,202
Jack, that toy cannot
hurt the boy.

45
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:13,456
But this one can.

46
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,853
Focus!

47
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:40,025
Come on, focus!

48
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:44,946
People are trying to sleep.

49
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:50,326
The film is out of focus.
The film... Never mind.

50
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:54,205
Nick!

51
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:18,188
Nick, are you okay?

52
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,276
The climax is on the fritz.

53
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:38,208
I never used to do that, Danny.

54
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:44,839
It is okay. I have seen this Slater
six times. I was just worried.

55
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,260
The new Jack Slater opens
this weekend.

56
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:57,143
Like I did not know that.
"They killed his cousin. Big mistake!"

57
00:07:57,394 --> 00:08:00,063
"Jack Slater IV."

58
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:06,069
I am checking the print tonight.
Midnight. Just myself.

59
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:13,827
I could get you admittance,
if that sort of thing appeals to you.

60
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:17,956
See it before it opens?
Who do I have to kill?

61
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:25,046
Just get to school.
You will only be four hours late.

62
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:54,868
{y:i}Treachery, conspiracy, sex,
{y:i}sword fights, madness, ghosts.

63
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,620
{y:i}And everybody dies.

64
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,999
Shakespeare's "Hamlet"
could not be more exciting.

65
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:05,962
And though he may seem
incapable of taking action, -

66
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:13,053
- he is one of the first
action heroes.

67
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:20,602
You will now see a scene from
the film by Laurence Olivier.

68
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:24,981
You may have seen him in the
Polaroid commercial -

69
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:31,321
- or as Zeus in
"Clash of the Titans".

70
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:36,534
{y:i}O bosom black as death.

71
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:44,125
{y:i}Help angels.
{y:i}All may yet be well.

72
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:47,379
{y:i}Now he is praying.

73
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:51,925
{y:i}And now I will do it.

74
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:11,319
{y:i}- And so he goes to heaven.
- Do not talk, just do it.

75
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,991
Hey, Claudius.

76
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:23,832
You killed my father.

77
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:27,836
Big mistake.

78
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,923
{y:i}Something is rotten
{y:i}in the state of Denmark.

79
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:37,929
{y:i}And Hamlet
{y:i}is taking out the trash.

80
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:48,606
- Stay thy hand, fair prince.
- Who said I am fair?

81
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:59,034
{y:i}No one is going to tell
{y:i}this sweet prince goodnight.

82
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:04,247
To be... or not to be.

83
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:08,543
Not to be.

84
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:29,647
The whole morning?
He was not?

85
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:35,612
No, he was not at school today.
He is sick as a lamb.

86
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:41,409
Tell me the story of your life
starting this morning, first period.

87
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,037
And make it good.

88
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:52,170
Something along the lines of:
"I cut so I could donate a kidney."

89
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:58,051
Were you at the movies again?
That crazy guy is an accessory.

90
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:03,556
- Nick is not crazy.
- Damn it, Danny!

91
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:13,149
I lied to a principal. And what for?
So you can go to the movies?

92
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,151
Sorry.

93
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:18,321
I did not choose this.

94
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:24,244
I did not ask to become a widow
before the age of forty.

95
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,079
I know that.

96
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:30,291
Give me a hug.

97
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,712
- I will not cut again.
- Let me hear the "P" word.

98
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:37,924
I promise.

99
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:43,888
Jesus! I am late.
I have to get to work.

100
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:48,018
Lock the top lock
the minute I close the door.

101
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:54,691
And do not open for anyone.
Bye. I love you.

102
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:50,497
Are you alone?
Okay. Move it!

103
00:13:55,669 --> 00:14:00,048
Do yourself to the drain.

104
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,720
Tough guy.

105
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:13,144
Do it.
I will make it easier for you.

106
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:17,857
Go ahead.

107
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,070
Do it.

108
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:29,619
What is it with you?
You have junk!

109
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:36,459
No jewelry, no VCR.
A shit TV worth twenty bucks.

110
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:40,463
Go fish, amigo.

111
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:47,178
Remember your mom says
you are to go straight home.

112
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:52,434
She will be there
when the shift is over.

113
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:58,440
If we find the guy,
I will give you a call.

114
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:38,229
- I almost gave up on you.
- I am sorry.

115
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:53,161
- What do you think?
- I have never seen anything like it.

116
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:59,793
- It is not too tight, is it?
- No. It is the style.

117
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:06,883
I always wanted to be a magician.
But my hands were too tiny.

118
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:12,889
My father worked here
and got me my first job. Usher.

119
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:22,399
I worked myself up to projectionist.
It is not much, but it is showbiz.

120
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,988
So, is the print ready?

121
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:34,828
Just a minute, young man.
Are we not forgetting something?

122
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:42,419
You have to have a ticket to see
a movie. And I have just the one.

123
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:51,344
When I was your age, Harry Houdini
played here and I met him backstage.

124
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:55,390
And he made a gesture
like this.

125
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:00,186
And all of a sudden
this was in his hand.

126
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:05,358
And he said to me:
"This is a magic ticket."

127
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:11,197
"I got it from an Indian magician,
who got it from a Tibetan magician."

128
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:17,328
"It is a passport to another world.
It was mine."

129
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:21,624
"And now it is yours."

130
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:27,756
And now it is yours.

131
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:34,095
- What does it do, Nick?
- I never had the courage to find out.

132
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:40,393
I have always wanted to try,
but I was afraid it would not work.

133
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:47,150
At your age Houdini was like a god
to me. What if he was faking?

134
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,237
And then again...

135
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:58,328
- What if it did work?
- What if it did?

136
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,791
Houdini said something else.
He said:

137
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:12,926
"This ticket has a mind of its own.
It does what it wants to do."

138
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:17,931
That always made me edgy.

139
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:25,730
I guess there is only one way
to find out then. Right?

140
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:33,655
Please retain your stub, sir.

141
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:40,704
- Shall we see if Slater wins?
- Jack Slater cannot lose.

142
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:45,667
Never has, never will.

143
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:31,671
{y:i}Oh, Frankie.

144
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:40,805
Frankie, why do you
keep on with the insults?

145
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:47,645
- I would not insult you, Mr. Vivaldi.
- When you lie, that is an insult.

146
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:54,110
You are Jack Slater's favourite cousin.
You talk all the time.

147
00:19:54,361 --> 00:20:03,995
I must know what Slater knows
and you are going to tell me.

148
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,290
Does he know
that me and Torelli -

149
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:13,630
- have just signed
a secret pact to control -

150
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,468
- all drugs
in Southern California?

151
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:26,434
We mostly talk
muzzle velocities. Guns.

152
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:43,910
Meet Mr. Benedict.

153
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:49,499
The genuine article.
And you better believe it.

154
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:57,340
Sometimes he likes to bake
while he shoots people.

155
00:20:57,841 --> 00:21:04,180
I am saying that Mr. Benedict
can take you out as easy as cake.

156
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:08,852
Pie, you Sicilian schmuck.

157
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:16,901
The man is a surgeon.

158
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:24,325
Do you want me to make him
operate on you?

159
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:28,663
I swear I do not know.

160
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:40,383
Dump him at his place.
But take it easy.

161
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:49,559
He bought it. He actually believes
me and Torelli are banding together.

162
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:57,192
The beauty part is, nobody knows
different. Until after the funeral.

163
00:21:57,442 --> 00:22:02,072
Then everybody knows.

164
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:13,625
Everybody knows
Tony Vivaldi is number one.

165
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:19,714
You are going to pay.

166
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:25,261
Is this right?
It does not look like a crack house.

167
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:33,395
Do you want 60 guys dancing on
the lawn throwing cocaine around?

168
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:50,286
- What is up, guys?
- Quiet. This is a drug bust.

169
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:54,290
Drug bust? You must be joking.

170
00:22:54,541 --> 00:23:00,547
My cousin Frank lives here.
The only drugs he has is aspirin.

171
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:04,426
If you touch that front door,
you are going to need them.

172
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:11,016
It must be a mistake.
We received an anonymous tip.

173
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:16,855
Frank?

174
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:36,207
Jack, listen to me.

175
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:39,002
- Who did this?
- Listen to me.

176
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:42,422
This is important.

177
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:51,681
Tony Vivaldi and the Torelli mob
are joining forces.

178
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:56,561
I am out of here.

179
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:09,032
Sorry, Frank.

180
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:34,057
It is a bomb!

181
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:47,404
He is okay. Minor wound.
Both cops dead.

182
00:25:04,796 --> 00:25:09,175
Two days to retirement.

183
00:26:19,913 --> 00:26:24,000
Nick?

184
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:54,447
- Who the hell are you?
- Do not shoot me! I am a kid.

185
00:27:03,957 --> 00:27:08,420
- How did you get here?
- I do not think you want to know.

186
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:13,675
Close your eyes, stay flat
and do not move!

187
00:27:31,943 --> 00:27:34,487
You are driving with no hands!

188
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:40,744
You have to practice
and never do it in heavy traffic.

189
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:53,798
I iced that guy,
to cone a phrase.

190
00:27:55,467 --> 00:28:00,388
Wait... The bad puns,
the voice, the hard rock.

191
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:05,935
This is really happening.

192
00:28:07,562 --> 00:28:13,526
This is not happening.
Repeat: This is not...

193
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:45,076
I threw up. Sorry.
I thought I was going to die.

194
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:51,416
I am sorry to disappoint you, but you
will live to enjoy the fruits of life.

195
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:58,923
Acne, shaving, premature
ejaculation and divorce.

196
00:30:19,986 --> 00:30:24,949
Does this suck weenie or what?

197
00:30:25,617 --> 00:30:28,787
This is a movie set.

198
00:30:29,037 --> 00:30:36,127
This is a movie. That is how
the scenery changed, right?

199
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:49,557
You are going to play chicken, right?
Just like Jack Slater.

200
00:30:52,852 --> 00:30:56,648
Fasten your seat belt, please.

201
00:30:56,898 --> 00:31:02,529
Your fingers?
Cross as many as you can.

202
00:31:43,361 --> 00:31:50,201
I am in the movie.
Holy cow, I am in the movie.

203
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:59,336
Nick, Houdini was not faking.

204
00:32:28,573 --> 00:32:32,535
Jack, did you see that?

205
00:32:37,374 --> 00:32:44,089
I was just in a real police station.
And this is much nicer.

206
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:49,010
Slater, it is your ex-wife
on line two!

207
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,722
You stay.
She is always calling me.

208
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:56,685
Hello, sweetheart.
It is nice to hear your voice.

209
00:32:56,935 --> 00:33:04,776
- Oiler! You team up with Waterman.
- Give me a partner, Sarge.

210
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:10,657
That is right.

211
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:17,580
Of course.
No, just as you said.

212
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:24,087
Krause!
You team up with the rabbi.

213
00:33:34,264 --> 00:33:38,143
- How do you get to Carnegie Hall?
- Practice!

214
00:33:38,393 --> 00:33:42,731
John Practice, you S.O.B.
Why are you not in Washington?

215
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:47,110
The Bureau thinks there is
something going on between...

216
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,905
Vivaldi is joining forces
with Torelli.

217
00:33:51,156 --> 00:33:56,786
- How do you do that?
- I do not sit around eating donuts.

218
00:33:57,037 --> 00:34:01,374
Those are government donuts.
I have to call D.C.

219
00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:04,210
Good for you.

220
00:34:04,461 --> 00:34:08,715
Watch it, Jack.
He killed Mozart.

221
00:34:08,965 --> 00:34:12,844
- In a movie?
- "Amadeus". It won 8 Oscars!

222
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:16,848
I saved him in 'Nam,
so I will be on the lookout.

223
00:34:17,098 --> 00:34:21,686
Now, no more movies.

224
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:25,857
Slater!!

225
00:34:26,816 --> 00:34:30,570
The city council is chewing my eggs
off for your plane crash!

226
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:34,949
The mayor is parading up my
Lincoln Tunnel for that beach stunt!

227
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,702
Everybody wants to know
what it will be!

228
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:42,082
- Do I make myself clear?!
- I am just doing my job.

229
00:34:42,332 --> 00:34:45,669
You have given us the worst
reputation in the country!

230
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:49,506
The Chamber of Commerce is doing
cartwheels in my cocoa factory!

231
00:34:49,756 --> 00:34:52,884
Ratcliff, you are on duty
with the cat.

232
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:57,013
Hiya, Toots!

233
00:34:57,931 --> 00:35:02,977
- Join me for a flea bath later?
- Touch me again and I will kill you!

234
00:35:03,228 --> 00:35:06,231
- I can prove this is a movie.
- Who are you?

235
00:35:06,481 --> 00:35:08,608
It is a cartoon cat.

236
00:35:08,858 --> 00:35:13,947
He is supposed to be back.
He was only suspended a month.

237
00:35:14,197 --> 00:35:20,704
Listen to me. An animated cat
just walked into the squad room.

238
00:35:20,954 --> 00:35:25,333
- He will do it again tomorrow.
- That cat is one of my best men.

239
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:28,837
Who is that smiling twerp?

240
00:35:29,087 --> 00:35:33,049
I love the way you fight, knowing
how you really feel about each other.

241
00:35:33,299 --> 00:35:37,470
How do I feel about this
sack of puppy poo?

242
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:41,141
You are dearest friends.
After your wife left you -

243
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:45,228
- Jack told everyone he drove
her to the diphtheria clinic.

244
00:35:45,478 --> 00:35:47,981
When he came back, you said:

245
00:35:48,231 --> 00:35:53,737
"You saved me from humiliation.
You are my dearest friend."

246
00:35:53,987 --> 00:35:56,656
- You promised not to tell.
- I did not.

247
00:35:56,906 --> 00:35:59,784
- Then how did he know?
- "Jack Slater I".

248
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:03,747
- Won what?
- No, the first Jack Slater.

249
00:36:03,997 --> 00:36:05,331
You told your dad?

250
00:36:05,582 --> 00:36:10,670
I told no one.
I do not know this kid.

251
00:36:11,546 --> 00:36:16,885
He seems to know
a lot about us.

252
00:36:17,135 --> 00:36:20,764
The state of New York has
never heard of you, Mr. Madigan.

253
00:36:21,014 --> 00:36:22,474
- What is your name?
- Danny Madigan.

254
00:36:22,724 --> 00:36:26,478
- Where are you from?
- How did you get in my car?

255
00:36:28,521 --> 00:36:35,153
I fell off a bridge into your car.
He saved my life.

256
00:36:35,403 --> 00:36:38,990
Truth at last.
Now why were they after you?

257
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,993
My cousin Frank found out
some drug information.

258
00:36:42,243 --> 00:36:47,957
Do not believe
what Vivaldi told him.

259
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:52,379
- How do you know about Vivaldi?
- I know what is going on.

260
00:36:52,629 --> 00:36:57,926
- If you would just listen...
- I have the perfect listener for you.

261
00:36:58,176 --> 00:37:00,470
Meet your new partner.

262
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:05,016
Oh no... Better to die.

263
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:09,437
You will love it, Jack.
We are perfect buddy material.

264
00:37:09,688 --> 00:37:13,775
I teach you to be vulnerable,
you teach me to be brave.

265
00:37:14,025 --> 00:37:22,075
I am Jack Slater's new partner.
We work together in this film.

266
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:25,578
You know I am right.
If this was the real world, -

267
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:31,292
- they would not make us partners,
but send me to a social worker.

268
00:37:31,543 --> 00:37:35,588
How do I know they tortured Frank
and stashed him behind his door?

269
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:39,300
I saw it on screen.
This is a movie.

270
00:37:39,551 --> 00:37:42,929
You are very clever, and I would
be roaring with laughter, -

271
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:45,890
- but they killed my cousin.
And that is a...

272
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:50,770
"Big mistake." That is what
you were going to say, right?

273
00:37:51,021 --> 00:37:56,776
- How would I know that?
- No one likes a smart-ass.

274
00:37:57,027 --> 00:38:02,198
Then shoot me. Point your gun
at my head and pull the trigger.

275
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:07,120
Come on. Do it.
I double dare you.

276
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:12,375
But you are not going to do it.
You do not kill kids in the movies.

277
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:16,421
Because you are the good guy.

278
00:38:16,671 --> 00:38:20,592
You really believe you are
inside a movie, do you not?

279
00:38:20,842 --> 00:38:27,682
You have ten minutes to prove it.
And then I shoot you.

280
00:38:33,313 --> 00:38:36,483
- Schwarzenegger films?
- Foreign films are in the back.

281
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:44,366
- No, this guy is an action star.
- Down the centre on the left.

282
00:38:50,455 --> 00:38:53,541
No, it is not possible.

283
00:38:53,792 --> 00:38:58,421
What? He is fantastic.
It is his best performance ever.

284
00:38:58,672 --> 00:39:04,010
- It was you in that movie.
- You were in a movie?

285
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:10,016
Yes, called "Girl of My Dreams".
It starred you.

286
00:39:10,266 --> 00:39:14,938
We had a very romantic
scene together.

287
00:39:15,188 --> 00:39:19,859
- What is the store's phone number?
- 5552310.

288
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:22,654
What is your home number?

289
00:39:22,904 --> 00:39:26,032
You can give it to him.
I am a police officer.

290
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:29,619
- 5553812.
- Amazing.

291
00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:34,541
I will bet that everyone
has a 555 number.

292
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:39,838
There can only be 9999 numbers
that start with 555.

293
00:39:40,088 --> 00:39:45,343
- How many people live in L.A.?
- Eight or nine million.

294
00:39:45,593 --> 00:39:48,680
That is why we have area codes.

295
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:51,808
- Is this your kid?
- Oh no.

296
00:39:52,058 --> 00:39:56,271
He is a mental patient
that I am taking downtown.

297
00:39:56,521 --> 00:40:01,943
What about this girl?
She is too attractive to work here.

298
00:40:02,193 --> 00:40:08,491
I agree. I think she should work
with us. Undercover of course.

299
00:40:08,742 --> 00:40:12,537
The point is there are
no unattractive women here.

300
00:40:12,787 --> 00:40:16,583
Where are the ordinary women?

301
00:40:16,833 --> 00:40:21,755
- Nowhere. This is a movie.
- No, this is California.

302
00:40:22,005 --> 00:40:27,385
And thanks. It was sweet
the way you got that girl's number.

303
00:40:27,635 --> 00:40:31,139
Okay, Mr. Non-believer.
I will take you to the house -

304
00:40:31,389 --> 00:40:38,605
- where your cousin Frank was tortured.
I have seen it on screen.

305
00:40:38,855 --> 00:40:40,357
It is like that one.

306
00:40:40,607 --> 00:40:45,570
But on the other side of the road.
It has an ocean view.

307
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:50,909
There is something
you do not understand.

308
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:59,501
This ticket is magic. Any second
we will drive right into a theatre.

309
00:41:01,127 --> 00:41:04,339
Maybe I need to warm it up.

310
00:41:04,589 --> 00:41:09,427
Of course. My decoder ring has
to warm up all the time.

311
00:41:09,678 --> 00:41:14,140
The house looked European.
Like a postcard from Italy.

312
00:41:14,391 --> 00:41:15,934
Like that one.

313
00:41:16,184 --> 00:41:23,692
In fact, just like that one!
The bad guys are in there.

314
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:28,988
- I think you should wear this.
- I have not earned it yet.

315
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:35,370
You just solved the entire case
and revolutionised police training.

316
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:41,167
I have studied human character,
terrorist psyche, fingerprints.

317
00:41:41,418 --> 00:41:46,548
I have taken courses in surveillance,
hostage negotiation and psychology.

318
00:41:46,798 --> 00:41:49,300
And all I had to do was drive
around the neighbourhood -

319
00:41:49,551 --> 00:41:53,930
- and point at a house and say:
"The bad guys are in there."

320
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,266
Trying to be funny?

321
00:41:56,516 --> 00:42:00,228
Yes. I am the famous comedian
Arnold Braunschweiger.

322
00:42:00,478 --> 00:42:05,442
- Schwarzenegger.
{y:i}- Gesundheit.

323
00:42:17,912 --> 00:42:19,748
May I help you?

324
00:42:19,998 --> 00:42:24,461
Yes. Could I speak to
the drug dealer of the house?

325
00:42:24,711 --> 00:42:33,178
We are out killing drug dealers.
Do you have any in the house?

326
00:42:35,263 --> 00:42:39,726
Be ready for anything.

327
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:42,437
Where are you going?

328
00:42:42,687 --> 00:42:46,983
I will be back.
You did not know I would say that.

329
00:42:47,233 --> 00:42:51,446
- You always say that.
- I do?

330
00:42:51,696 --> 00:42:58,745
Everybody waits for you to say it.
It is like your calling card.

331
00:42:58,787 --> 00:43:02,332
You are interested in
drug dealers?

332
00:43:02,582 --> 00:43:07,295
Jack, that is the henchman
with the glass eye.

333
00:43:07,545 --> 00:43:12,967
- Are you a henchman?
- No, I only go as far as lackey.

334
00:43:13,218 --> 00:43:16,805
- Anything else?
- Take off your sunglasses.

335
00:43:17,055 --> 00:43:21,476
- Who is asking?
- The Tin Man.

336
00:43:21,726 --> 00:43:26,856
- I suggest you hit the bricks.
- No. They are the wrong colour.

337
00:43:27,107 --> 00:43:34,531
Oh, dear. Let us change them.
Would arterial red suit you?

338
00:43:37,826 --> 00:43:44,165
Make no mistake.
They are very well trained.

339
00:43:45,625 --> 00:43:52,465
I snap my fingers again and tomorrow
you emerge from several canine rectum.

340
00:43:52,716 --> 00:43:56,636
Or you and Toto can go back to Oz.
Questions?

341
00:43:56,886 --> 00:44:01,057
Yes. Two of them.

342
00:44:01,307 --> 00:44:04,978
Why am I wasting time on
a putz like you -

343
00:44:05,228 --> 00:44:10,775
- when I could be doing something
dangerous like rearranging my socks?

344
00:44:11,026 --> 00:44:20,035
And how will you snap your fingers
after I rip off both your thumbs?

345
00:44:24,247 --> 00:44:28,043
Have a nice day.

346
00:44:32,505 --> 00:44:41,473
He had one with a bull's-eye earlier.
He calls his boss a Sicilian schmuck.

347
00:44:54,986 --> 00:44:59,574
How did Slater find out?
Will you tell me?

348
00:44:59,824 --> 00:45:04,913
I want him to join me, but he
keeps going after the bad guys.

349
00:45:05,163 --> 00:45:08,750
Where is it written
that I am a bad guy?

350
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:16,007
Find out who talked and have
him killed. Then, Slater.

351
00:45:16,633 --> 00:45:22,013
- What is it with you?
- We should call off the funeral.

352
00:45:22,263 --> 00:45:26,518
Are you crazy?
When I say blood bath, there is...

353
00:45:26,768 --> 00:45:30,021
A blood bath.

354
00:45:30,271 --> 00:45:37,112
I will find out more about
Slater's short friend.

355
00:45:37,362 --> 00:45:42,659
- He must be guilty of something.
- Yes, of acting like an asshole.

356
00:45:42,909 --> 00:45:45,995
If I arrest him,
I have to arrest Congress.

357
00:45:46,246 --> 00:45:49,666
- Why did your park there?
- In case my ex-wife is here.

358
00:45:49,916 --> 00:45:53,795
She is not.
Her name was not in the credits.

359
00:45:54,045 --> 00:45:57,966
- Who does the doctor treat?
- Patients.

360
00:45:58,216 --> 00:46:02,053
- What is the elbow of my jacket doing?
- Wearing thin?

361
00:46:02,303 --> 00:46:05,306
Bingo!

362
00:46:05,557 --> 00:46:08,768
That was a stretch.

363
00:46:09,019 --> 00:46:14,566
- Do you drive this on the weekends?
- No, that is my girl's car.

364
00:46:14,816 --> 00:46:17,235
Knock on the door.

365
00:46:17,485 --> 00:46:24,701
Your ex-wife is not home.
Her name was not in the credits.

366
00:46:27,912 --> 00:46:29,289
Meredith?

367
00:46:29,539 --> 00:46:33,043
- I hope you mean Whitney.
- Sorry. Whitney.

368
00:46:33,293 --> 00:46:38,006
You are not Skeezy, are you?

369
00:46:38,381 --> 00:46:41,176
Daddy!

370
00:46:41,426 --> 00:46:45,430
- Stop it, Daddy!
- You have gained some weight.

371
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:51,102
Hi. I am Danny Madigan
and my life has not been long yet.

372
00:46:51,353 --> 00:46:56,691
But from now on,
it will all be downhill.

373
00:46:56,941 --> 00:46:58,526
- You look wonderful.
- Thank you.

374
00:46:58,777 --> 00:47:02,447
So, who is your friend?
He is cute.

375
00:47:02,697 --> 00:47:06,284
No, he is hopelessly insane.

376
00:47:06,534 --> 00:47:09,537
He probably loved you in
"Gone With the Wind".

377
00:47:09,788 --> 00:47:12,874
- This is her first movie.
- Do you see?

378
00:47:13,124 --> 00:47:15,877
- Who is Skeezy?
- It is a sorority thing.

379
00:47:16,127 --> 00:47:19,714
They assign you a freshman
and when he comes by you kiss him.

380
00:47:19,964 --> 00:47:23,301
- Do you have to kiss him?
- Dad, come on!

381
00:47:23,551 --> 00:47:30,809
If the phone rings for me, I will be
out of the shower in less than an hour.

382
00:47:31,059 --> 00:47:34,270
What a cutie.

383
00:47:34,562 --> 00:47:39,150
That is old evidence.
Counterfeit case. Looks real, right?

384
00:47:39,401 --> 00:47:45,824
It turns funny colours when you
burn it. I used it for alimony.

385
00:47:52,956 --> 00:47:56,835
What is wrong?

386
00:48:00,296 --> 00:48:05,969
You do not happen to have
a cigar, do you?

387
00:48:08,471 --> 00:48:13,351
"I will be back." I know.

388
00:48:30,869 --> 00:48:35,498
Dad! Dad!

389
00:49:07,655 --> 00:49:11,993
He would have been your age.

390
00:49:12,243 --> 00:49:20,835
I know. The Ripper pulled him
down off the roof three years ago.

391
00:49:20,835 --> 00:49:27,759
- Your dad saw everything.
- How do you know all that?

392
00:49:27,926 --> 00:49:32,722
Your dad is in the papers a lot.
I like crime stories.

393
00:49:32,972 --> 00:49:38,812
- That is Skeezy.
- I will get rid of him.

394
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:48,488
Hello, Toto.

395
00:49:51,908 --> 00:49:56,162
There and there and there.

396
00:49:56,413 --> 00:50:00,709
Let go of me!

397
00:50:02,836 --> 00:50:10,093
- Good evening. Is Uncle Jack here?
- He is off tracking a lead.

398
00:50:10,218 --> 00:50:14,139
Joe, would you teach her
the virtue of silence?

399
00:50:14,389 --> 00:50:17,892
Benedict, if you harm
a hair on her head...

400
00:50:18,143 --> 00:50:21,354
Stop!

401
00:50:36,619 --> 00:50:40,957
You were saying?

402
00:50:42,167 --> 00:50:49,341
Now, I believe it was
Sherlock Holmes who said:

403
00:50:49,591 --> 00:50:52,844
"Eliminate all logical
solutions to a problem -

404
00:50:53,094 --> 00:50:57,390
- and the illogical becomes
invariably true."

405
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:06,107
I know your name is Daniel Madigan,
but how do you know mine?

406
00:51:07,442 --> 00:51:13,365
Slater showed me some mugshots.
We made your face easy.

407
00:51:13,615 --> 00:51:18,328
Daniel Madigan from New York.
A long way from home.

408
00:51:18,578 --> 00:51:21,706
- When did you get here?
- Just.

409
00:51:21,956 --> 00:51:25,919
Then how do you know
what I said on the terrace?

410
00:51:26,169 --> 00:51:28,129
I heard a recording.

411
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:33,802
- Are there microphones in the statues?
- You would not believe how many.

412
00:51:34,052 --> 00:51:39,140
- And the eye I was wearing?
- I saw it.

413
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:43,395
I saw it in a movie. There were
micro-cameras in the statues.

414
00:51:43,645 --> 00:51:51,111
I have killed people smarter
and younger than you.

415
00:51:57,701 --> 00:52:03,832
This is between you and Slater.
Take the money in the desk -

416
00:52:04,082 --> 00:52:10,714
- and leave me and Meredith...
Whitney, alone.

417
00:52:12,716 --> 00:52:16,803
Holy shit, boss.
It looks like two K in here.

418
00:52:17,053 --> 00:52:22,017
Just a minute. Give it to me.

419
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:35,905
These bills are marked, right?
You tried to sucker me with them.

420
00:52:36,281 --> 00:52:38,950
Burn it.

421
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,454
- Burn it?
- Yes, burn it.

422
00:52:42,704 --> 00:52:48,793
Do not play games with grown-ups.
You will get hurt.

423
00:53:09,147 --> 00:53:12,609
Big mistake.

424
00:53:29,209 --> 00:53:34,089
Great, is it not?
I will hurt you a little bit.

425
00:53:34,339 --> 00:53:43,264
Freeze! Lose the guns or I redecorate
in brain matter grey. Got it?

426
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:48,645
Kill me and I will kill him.

427
00:53:52,899 --> 00:53:57,153
Leave it. Get the door.

428
00:54:04,494 --> 00:54:07,747
Boss?

429
00:54:46,244 --> 00:54:50,790
Do not give up your day job.

430
00:55:21,196 --> 00:55:24,783
Jack!

431
00:55:27,827 --> 00:55:32,290
Do not leave home without it.

432
00:55:40,131 --> 00:55:46,554
- Where are you going?
- I have to catch the red-eye.

433
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:59,776
I do not believe this.
I am in the movie and...

434
00:56:00,026 --> 00:56:04,197
I am missing the action!

435
00:56:06,032 --> 00:56:10,036
Get the hell out of here!

436
00:56:24,467 --> 00:56:27,804
Back up the top!

437
00:56:33,685 --> 00:56:40,358
Next time we get thicker armour.
Like a tank.

438
00:56:58,835 --> 00:57:02,339
Chicken it is.

439
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:17,145
This is going to work.
It is a movie. I am a good guy.

440
00:57:19,898 --> 00:57:30,116
I am a comedy sidekick.
Oh, shit! It is not going to work!

441
00:57:55,308 --> 00:58:02,190
- I think I scared them.
- You did great. Come on.

442
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:04,401
Benedict has the ticket.

443
00:58:04,651 --> 00:58:10,740
Too bad.
I wanted it for my collection.

444
00:59:46,795 --> 00:59:50,090
{y:i}You are travelling through
{y:i}another dimension.

445
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:55,762
My name is Skeezy.
S-K-E-E-Z-Y.

446
01:00:42,267 --> 01:00:46,062
Say this.

447
01:00:48,106 --> 01:00:53,611
- Grow up.
- Just say this one word.

448
01:00:53,862 --> 01:00:59,034
- Is it another movie proof?
- Maybe.

449
01:00:59,284 --> 01:01:04,622
- I do not want to say it.
- Say what?

450
01:01:04,873 --> 01:01:11,671
You cannot say it, because
this movie is PG-13. Admit it.

451
01:01:11,921 --> 01:01:16,593
Slater. The guy with the missing eye,
I saw his licence plate.

452
01:01:16,843 --> 01:01:20,347
Good for you.

453
01:01:21,556 --> 01:01:28,688
- You mean the guy with the glass eye?
- No, when he ran it was missing.

454
01:01:28,938 --> 01:01:32,859
It has got words.

455
01:01:33,193 --> 01:01:37,697
"Vengeance is..."

456
01:01:37,947 --> 01:01:40,241
No!

457
01:01:53,171 --> 01:01:56,966
Did you catch that?

458
01:02:03,223 --> 01:02:05,141
Some of it may be English.

459
01:02:05,392 --> 01:02:07,811
See if this is clear enough:

460
01:02:08,061 --> 01:02:13,525
Give me your badge!
And you will not get it back.

461
01:02:21,408 --> 01:02:29,124
Wohlschläger, team up with
the digitalised Humphrey Bogart.

462
01:02:38,466 --> 01:02:41,594
Are you making some changes?

463
01:02:41,845 --> 01:02:46,808
Why not come and work the funeral
with me? I would not miss it.

464
01:02:47,058 --> 01:02:52,355
Torelli has spent a bundle. He has
a helicopter circling the building.

465
01:02:52,605 --> 01:02:56,276
A rooftop funeral in Long Beach.
How is that for taste?

466
01:02:56,526 --> 01:03:00,447
- Who died?
- Leo the Fart. Shot yesterday.

467
01:03:00,697 --> 01:03:03,366
Somebody tried for Torelli
and missed.

468
01:03:03,616 --> 01:03:09,205
Leo was tough. Only he could not
sneak up on you.

469
01:03:09,456 --> 01:03:16,129
If you change your mind,
I will be in front of the hotel.

470
01:03:31,936 --> 01:03:37,442
- Where are we, anyway?
- Home.

471
01:03:50,455 --> 01:03:52,791
How did you know
there was a guy in there?

472
01:03:53,041 --> 01:03:58,254
There always is. It costs me
a fortune in closet doors.

473
01:03:58,505 --> 01:04:01,633
Like in "Slater II -
The Sagittarius Strangler".

474
01:04:01,883 --> 01:04:06,721
Soon you will meet the Madigan
Strangler. I just got fired.

475
01:04:06,971 --> 01:04:13,520
What you find so entertaining is my life.
I am not even a cop anymore.

476
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:19,275
He only took your badge, because you
destroyed more of the city than usual.

477
01:04:19,526 --> 01:04:25,907
Jack, you are everybody's hero.
It will all be okay again. Trust me.

478
01:04:26,157 --> 01:04:33,748
No, Danny. It is getting harder.
I only wanted to be a decent cop.

479
01:04:33,998 --> 01:04:38,044
But I kept getting involved
in crazy adventures.

480
01:04:38,294 --> 01:04:42,090
But the craziest part is,
I kept surviving.

481
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:48,638
These are the sequels.
They have to get harder.

482
01:04:48,805 --> 01:04:52,892
Look on the good side.
You have a great daughter.

483
01:04:53,143 --> 01:04:57,313
And your ex-wife would not call
if she did not want you back.

484
01:04:57,564 --> 01:05:01,776
Do you think she cannot tell
the real voice from a taped one?

485
01:05:02,027 --> 01:05:09,451
I pay a cashier to call me at work,
so the guys think I have a life.

486
01:05:09,701 --> 01:05:15,123
My ex-wife is happily remarried.
She never calls.

487
01:05:15,373 --> 01:05:20,545
And Whitney. Why can she not be
a normal teenager?

488
01:05:20,795 --> 01:05:25,467
On prom night she stays home
to field strip an AK-47.

489
01:05:25,717 --> 01:05:32,223
She will die a young maid.
I am going to buy it soon, too.

490
01:05:32,474 --> 01:05:38,438
No way. You cannot die
until the grosses go down.

491
01:05:38,688 --> 01:05:42,734
Vivaldi said something would
happen at a funeral.

492
01:05:42,984 --> 01:05:46,279
We should look into
this funeral.

493
01:05:46,529 --> 01:05:48,156
Whatever.

494
01:05:48,406 --> 01:05:52,494
Jack, it is a funeral
for a guy named Fart.

495
01:05:52,744 --> 01:05:54,287
Funeral?

496
01:05:54,537 --> 01:06:01,211
Someone tried to kill Torelli,
but hit Leo the Fart instead, right?

497
01:06:01,461 --> 01:06:09,135
Wrong. Did Benedict take the shot?
Most likely. Would he miss? No way.

498
01:06:09,386 --> 01:06:14,766
- Unless he wanted to miss.
- Did he mean to miss? Why?

499
01:06:15,016 --> 01:06:19,896
Because Leo the Fart was
very, very fat. Get it?

500
01:06:20,146 --> 01:06:21,564
No, I do not.

501
01:06:21,815 --> 01:06:26,277
They broke in, cut Leo open
and stuffed him with T.N.T.

502
01:06:26,528 --> 01:06:32,784
He goes off at the funeral and
takes out the whole Torelli mob.

503
01:06:33,034 --> 01:06:38,164
That is what this is all about.
Vivaldi will blow up that funeral.

504
01:06:38,415 --> 01:06:43,003
It would not be a bomb. We have had
a dozen explosions in this movie.

505
01:06:43,253 --> 01:06:46,423
Do not start that again.

506
01:06:46,673 --> 01:06:49,092
- Nerve gas!
- What are you talking about?

507
01:06:49,342 --> 01:06:53,304
Some nerve gas has been stolen
from military trucks.

508
01:06:53,555 --> 01:06:58,643
They could have put it inside him.
Do you know what that means?

509
01:06:58,893 --> 01:07:04,149
Leo the Fart will pass gas
one more time.

510
01:07:16,953 --> 01:07:18,413
Mr. Torelli.

511
01:07:18,663 --> 01:07:23,960
I hope it is all right I am here.
I do not want to be a fourth wheel.

512
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:28,006
Fifth wheel.

513
01:07:29,382 --> 01:07:37,307
Did you hear that, Benedict?
Family. Go pay your respects.

514
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:13,134
- Stay in the car.
- No, I am coming with you.

515
01:08:13,385 --> 01:08:15,679
Let us say this is a movie.

516
01:08:15,929 --> 01:08:21,017
If someone says, "Stay in the car",
and the guy does not, what happens?

517
01:08:21,267 --> 01:08:23,395
- He saves the day.
- Or gets killed.

518
01:08:23,645 --> 01:08:26,106
Good point. I will stay.

519
01:08:26,356 --> 01:08:30,652
Wait a minute!
What if that gets me killed?

520
01:08:30,902 --> 01:08:36,491
There is a gun in
the glove compartment.

521
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:43,081
- Practice!
- Makes perfect.

522
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,920
The Fart is a bomb
to take out the Torelli mob.

523
01:08:49,170 --> 01:08:57,095
That explains the mortuary break in.
Let us use the service entrance.

524
01:08:59,723 --> 01:09:03,476
- Who do you work for, John?
- What do you mean?

525
01:09:03,727 --> 01:09:09,941
We both know there is
no side entrance to this hotel.

526
01:09:10,984 --> 01:09:17,824
I am sorry, Jack. I did not
want it to go down this way.

527
01:09:18,116 --> 01:09:23,288
Danny said not to trust you.
He said you killed Moe Zart.

528
01:09:23,538 --> 01:09:27,500
- Moe who?
- Zart.

529
01:09:28,043 --> 01:09:30,962
I kill many people.
I cannot remember them all.

530
01:09:31,212 --> 01:09:35,008
How do you get to Carnegie Hall?

531
01:09:35,258 --> 01:09:38,970
In a bodybag
if you do not drop that.

532
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:41,723
That is doubtful, kid.

533
01:09:41,973 --> 01:09:46,019
Real doubtful.

534
01:09:47,687 --> 01:09:52,859
Thank you for the fingerprints.
You are about to murder Jack Slater.

535
01:09:53,109 --> 01:09:57,155
Chain yourself to that pipe.

536
01:09:57,405 --> 01:10:01,368
These drug guys have more money
than the government.

537
01:10:01,618 --> 01:10:06,331
So you cut a deal with
a scumbag like Vivaldi.

538
01:10:06,581 --> 01:10:12,545
Vivaldi made up with Torelli, but it
was a phoney. He will destroy him.

539
01:10:12,796 --> 01:10:17,592
In exchange for leaving him alone,
he gives me a profit percentage.

540
01:10:17,842 --> 01:10:20,637
I will be rich, Jack.
You will be dead, but...

541
01:10:20,887 --> 01:10:22,931
Freeze!

542
01:10:23,181 --> 01:10:25,558
Toss me the cuffs.

543
01:10:25,809 --> 01:10:31,356
You idiot. You made the classic
movie mistake. Do not explain so much.

544
01:10:31,606 --> 01:10:37,028
You had to get in a last few words.
Had you fired, you would have won.

545
01:10:37,278 --> 01:10:41,324
But you are the typical villain.
Dumb.

546
01:10:41,574 --> 01:10:45,161
You are no genius yourself, kid.

547
01:10:45,412 --> 01:10:50,834
- The Fart goes off in 7 minutes.
- Get my car.

548
01:10:51,084 --> 01:10:55,088
Move it.

549
01:10:56,339 --> 01:11:05,890
I would love to stay and watch,
but I have to establish my alibi.

550
01:11:06,307 --> 01:11:09,185
{y:i}Arrivederci.

551
01:11:09,436 --> 01:11:11,312
Did you want to save the day?

552
01:11:11,563 --> 01:11:16,067
- You are not doing anything.
- I would steal your thunder.

553
01:11:16,317 --> 01:11:21,865
No, you stay here and make sure
everything goes as planned.

554
01:11:22,115 --> 01:11:29,122
You have had Slater in front of the
8-ball before, but you screwed it up.

555
01:11:32,917 --> 01:11:36,880
That is "behind" the 8-ball.
You moron.

556
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:44,721
Somebody once told me I talk
too much. No more words.

557
01:11:45,347 --> 01:11:50,727
- Whiskers! Where have you been?
- Sorry, Jack. Fur ball problem.

558
01:11:50,977 --> 01:11:55,273
Seal off the area. There will be
a chemical explosion in 5 minutes.

559
01:11:55,523 --> 01:12:02,072
- Thanks, Whiskers. I owe you one.
- Forget it. You have often saved me.

560
01:12:04,407 --> 01:12:09,788
Do you see the hook of that crane?
Get it up on the roof in 2 minutes.

561
01:12:10,038 --> 01:12:14,042
How do I do that?

562
01:12:38,650 --> 01:12:44,406
Help me move that crane!
I have to get it to the roof!

563
01:12:44,656 --> 01:12:49,327
Wait!
You have to work this thing!

564
01:12:57,585 --> 01:13:01,881
I cannot even drive.

565
01:13:31,619 --> 01:13:35,832
Pardon me.

566
01:13:45,842 --> 01:13:51,139
He was a good man.
A flatulent man.

567
01:13:53,058 --> 01:13:57,729
Do you hear this?
Help me! Get me out of here!

568
01:13:57,979 --> 01:14:02,817
My God! This man is not dead!

569
01:14:10,116 --> 01:14:13,620
Get out of the way!
This man needs a doctor!

570
01:14:13,870 --> 01:14:16,831
- This man needs a doctor!
- I am a doctor.

571
01:14:17,082 --> 01:14:22,170
Are you a doctor?
Check his chin.

572
01:14:22,379 --> 01:14:25,840
The doctor has fainted.
Can somebody help this man?

573
01:14:26,091 --> 01:14:32,889
I will take the corpse...
The patient... Look, an elephant!

574
01:14:38,353 --> 01:14:43,191
Do not shoot! He will drop Leo!

575
01:15:04,421 --> 01:15:07,590
Do not shoot!

576
01:16:15,492 --> 01:16:18,536
Oh, shit!

577
01:17:04,457 --> 01:17:08,545
That is a no-fly zone, fellow.

578
01:17:53,965 --> 01:18:01,222
Danny! He is ticking!
Move the crane as fast as you can!

579
01:18:22,202 --> 01:18:27,248
Danny, stop the crane now!

580
01:18:27,499 --> 01:18:32,253
Drop! Go, go, go!

581
01:18:35,548 --> 01:18:39,761
Drop, you gas bag!

582
01:18:59,739 --> 01:19:04,327
Everybody out of here!

583
01:19:42,741 --> 01:19:46,661
Silent but deadly.

584
01:19:48,747 --> 01:19:54,502
- Bring the car around.
- The helicopter landed on it.

585
01:19:54,753 --> 01:19:56,880
I hate when that happens.

586
01:19:57,130 --> 01:20:02,344
Tar actually sticks
to some people.

587
01:20:10,435 --> 01:20:14,564
Hey, Dad!
I thought you could use some clothes.

588
01:20:14,814 --> 01:20:16,191
Thank you, honey.

589
01:20:16,441 --> 01:20:25,283
- Is this not a little convenient?
- You always said this was a movie.

590
01:20:28,745 --> 01:20:32,374
{y:i}So how did it go?

591
01:20:33,583 --> 01:20:37,295
{y:i}How did it go?

592
01:20:38,922 --> 01:20:45,887
{y:i}I am dying out here.
{y:i}I want to know how it went.

593
01:20:51,101 --> 01:20:54,062
{y:i}How did it went?

594
01:20:54,312 --> 01:20:56,189
Splendid.

595
01:20:56,439 --> 01:20:58,983
{y:i}What?

596
01:20:59,234 --> 01:21:01,361
It went splendidly.

597
01:21:01,611 --> 01:21:08,576
I cannot hear you.
I do not want to miss a thing.

598
01:21:08,618 --> 01:21:12,122
Benedict, get your stuff.
Was it beautiful?

599
01:21:12,372 --> 01:21:14,582
Perfect in every detail.

600
01:21:14,833 --> 01:21:17,794
Were the gas tanks okay?

601
01:21:18,044 --> 01:21:21,423
Like clockwork.
You should have been there.

602
01:21:21,673 --> 01:21:26,302
Men, women and children
dropping left and right.

603
01:21:26,553 --> 01:21:31,850
Wait, I want to enjoy it all.
Come on, tell me.

604
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:37,313
They were writhing and screaming
and leaping to their doom to escape.

605
01:21:37,564 --> 01:21:40,358
- Really?
- No, I am lying.

606
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:47,032
It was a complete balls-up, and my
day has been terrible thanks to you.

607
01:21:47,282 --> 01:21:54,414
What is this? You were my friend
and now you turn a 360 on me.

608
01:21:54,664 --> 01:21:59,878
180, you stupid
spaghetti-slurping cretin.

609
01:22:00,128 --> 01:22:06,718
If I did a 360, I would end up
back where I started!

610
01:22:07,594 --> 01:22:10,847
Trust me.

611
01:22:12,349 --> 01:22:18,438
If that turd Daniel Madigan can move
through parallel worlds, so can I.

612
01:22:18,688 --> 01:22:26,988
In, steal whatever I want,
and out again. Impossible to catch.

613
01:22:27,238 --> 01:22:30,867
If God was a villain -

614
01:22:31,117 --> 01:22:34,454
- he would be me.

615
01:22:34,704 --> 01:22:41,544
- You want me to vacuum now?
- No. But the pool needs attention.

616
01:22:41,795 --> 01:22:45,090
Very good.

617
01:22:58,019 --> 01:23:02,107
Do not move.

618
01:23:02,857 --> 01:23:09,489
- All right, I will go quietly.
- The hell you will.

619
01:23:14,828 --> 01:23:18,415
That was for blowing up
my cousin Frank's house.

620
01:23:18,665 --> 01:23:24,838
And this is for blowing up
my ex-wife's house.

621
01:23:24,838 --> 01:23:30,385
But this is for
my daughter's black eye!

622
01:23:32,846 --> 01:23:36,850
Usually when I do that,
it leaves a hole.

623
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:42,272
The ticket.
Jack, he has got the ticket!

624
01:23:42,522 --> 01:23:47,402
It is the key to everything.
It is magic. See?

625
01:23:47,652 --> 01:23:54,993
He has gone over to my world.
The door must still be open. Come on!

626
01:23:55,243 --> 01:23:58,830
I am not worried
that you are crazy anymore.

627
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:05,253
I am worried that you are right.
But if I go, how do I get back?

628
01:24:05,503 --> 01:24:13,303
You cannot go through life
nit-picking everything. Come on!

629
01:24:15,638 --> 01:24:19,392
To hell with it.

630
01:24:23,605 --> 01:24:27,901
There was nothing to it.

631
01:24:28,068 --> 01:24:33,907
- We are still here.
- Are you sure? Look.

632
01:24:36,659 --> 01:24:39,621
Quickly!

633
01:24:40,580 --> 01:24:45,085
- I want to see about Nick.
- No time.

634
01:24:46,753 --> 01:24:48,505
What the hell?

635
01:24:48,755 --> 01:24:52,133
- We are in New York.
- It all makes sense.

636
01:24:52,384 --> 01:24:56,054
Actually, it makes no sense,
but I will explain. Later.

637
01:24:56,304 --> 01:25:01,559
Just be careful.
Things are different here.

638
01:25:02,769 --> 01:25:04,145
Get out!

639
01:25:04,396 --> 01:25:08,358
Do not get feisty. The car
was a piece of junk anyway.

640
01:25:08,608 --> 01:25:12,237
Drive, bonehead!

641
01:25:13,238 --> 01:25:18,743
Here is another explosion
for your movie.

642
01:25:22,580 --> 01:25:26,334
Not one word.

643
01:25:35,927 --> 01:25:39,639
- My hand hurts.
- Things are different here.

644
01:25:39,889 --> 01:25:42,851
Smash a window with your hand
and it gets hurt.

645
01:25:43,101 --> 01:25:48,356
Great. Could you not
have told me earlier?

646
01:25:50,358 --> 01:25:56,364
- The taxis must be bulletproof.
- We have to get the ticket.

647
01:26:14,257 --> 01:26:18,720
No way, Slater. Listen to me.
It will not work.

648
01:26:18,970 --> 01:26:21,765
You cannot play chicken
in real life. You will crash.

649
01:26:22,015 --> 01:26:24,142
Out of the car, amigo.

650
01:26:24,392 --> 01:26:27,854
This is not the movies.
You have to reload guns...

651
01:26:28,104 --> 01:26:32,108
- Go, Danny! Get out!
- Car crashes can kill you!

652
01:26:32,359 --> 01:26:37,989
You are going to die!
Jack!!

653
01:26:38,198 --> 01:26:41,868
What did I do?

654
01:26:47,290 --> 01:26:51,086
No, please...

655
01:26:59,886 --> 01:27:01,721
Damn, that hurt.

656
01:27:01,971 --> 01:27:04,891
You are lucky to be alive,
you dumb idiot!

657
01:27:05,141 --> 01:27:13,274
'89 Mercury Sable, standard air bag.
Checker cab, no air bag. Who is dumb?

658
01:27:13,525 --> 01:27:19,656
- Just make sure they are dead.
- Give me a break. They are dead.

659
01:27:19,906 --> 01:27:23,410
They always look dead.
In "Die Hard" a guy is hung -

660
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:28,707
- and at the end of the movie,
he comes back.

661
01:27:28,957 --> 01:27:36,756
All right. Make sure to cover me.
He may have a windshield wiper.

662
01:27:40,218 --> 01:27:44,889
Maybe he used the ticket.

663
01:27:45,306 --> 01:27:50,186
Maybe it is on all the time now.

664
01:28:02,323 --> 01:28:05,285
What is this place?

665
01:28:05,535 --> 01:28:09,622
Where am I now?

666
01:28:10,373 --> 01:28:15,920
Danny, do you have a place
I can sit down?

667
01:28:15,962 --> 01:28:20,633
Yes. Come on.

668
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:22,844
Nick!

669
01:28:23,094 --> 01:28:27,140
Danny, I was so worried.
Are you okay?

670
01:28:27,390 --> 01:28:29,476
Did you see what happened?

671
01:28:29,726 --> 01:28:35,106
No, I slept in here until I woke up
at 2 a.m. I figured you had gone home.

672
01:28:35,357 --> 01:28:38,902
No, I was in the movie!

673
01:28:39,152 --> 01:28:43,281
I am getting up in the years.
Define "in".

674
01:28:43,531 --> 01:28:49,162
Whitney kissed me! I drove a crane
and dropped Leo the Fart in a tar pit!

675
01:28:49,412 --> 01:28:55,627
I was with Jack Slater
every step of the way!

676
01:28:57,003 --> 01:29:00,298
Oh, my God...

677
01:29:00,965 --> 01:29:04,094
The ticket works?

678
01:29:04,344 --> 01:29:12,102
All this time I never used it,
because I was too frightened.

679
01:29:12,352 --> 01:29:16,731
But it is not too late.
I can still go visit.

680
01:29:16,981 --> 01:29:24,197
Garbo in "Camille".
Jean Harlow. Boy, I had a crush.

681
01:29:24,447 --> 01:29:28,743
Monroe in "Bus Stop".

682
01:29:28,868 --> 01:29:34,749
Forgive me for going on, sir.
I admire your work greatly, too.

683
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:41,089
- Nick, it is not who you think.
- You mean, it is...?

684
01:29:41,339 --> 01:29:44,843
This is a wonderful moment,
Mr. Slater.

685
01:29:45,093 --> 01:29:49,681
I have never met
a fictional character before.

686
01:29:49,931 --> 01:29:53,977
How new and exciting
this must all be for you.

687
01:29:54,227 --> 01:29:57,605
I have just found out
I am imaginary.

688
01:29:57,856 --> 01:30:00,984
How would you like
to have been made up?

689
01:30:01,234 --> 01:30:09,075
Your job, your marriage, your kids.
Let us push his son off the building.

690
01:30:09,325 --> 01:30:14,622
You will have eternal nightmares,
but you are fictional, so who cares?

691
01:30:14,873 --> 01:30:21,046
I do not find it new and exciting
that my whole life is a damn movie.

692
01:30:21,296 --> 01:30:27,052
You are young and impressionable.
There are worse things than movies.

693
01:30:27,302 --> 01:30:33,433
Politicians, wars, forest fires.
Famine, plague.

694
01:30:33,683 --> 01:30:38,563
- Sickness, pain, warts, politicians.
- You have already mentioned them.

695
01:30:38,813 --> 01:30:43,360
I know. They are twice as bad
as anything else.

696
01:30:43,610 --> 01:30:49,949
Most of my life has been movies, too.
But that is all over for me now.

697
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:54,537
The theatre is shut.
Soon it is the wrecking ball.

698
01:30:54,788 --> 01:31:00,460
But now I have a new chance.
Can I have the ticket back?

699
01:31:00,877 --> 01:31:05,924
We have one little... hiccup.

700
01:31:06,174 --> 01:31:11,304
- What do you mean?
- Benedict has the ticket.

701
01:31:11,554 --> 01:31:16,601
The madman with the glass eye?

702
01:31:17,852 --> 01:31:21,690
- How are you getting back?
- Good question.

703
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:28,071
But I would not want to
nit-pick, right, Danny?

704
01:31:29,572 --> 01:31:33,827
Just follow my lead.

705
01:31:36,788 --> 01:31:40,709
Where have you been?
Do you know what time it is?

706
01:31:40,959 --> 01:31:44,129
The police call,
you are nowhere to be found...

707
01:31:44,379 --> 01:31:49,050
- Mom, I am sorry, okay?
- "Okay"?

708
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:55,056
There are kids with guns everywhere
and that is all you have to say?

709
01:31:55,306 --> 01:31:59,310
- Get in here!
- Mom, wait.

710
01:31:59,561 --> 01:32:06,401
You always say you wish
I had more friends. Well...

711
01:32:11,448 --> 01:32:18,121
Hello, Mrs. Madigan.
Arnold Braunschweiger.

712
01:32:36,931 --> 01:32:42,228
Sweetheart,
do you want to have a party?

713
01:32:43,646 --> 01:32:48,777
- How old are you?
- Forget it.

714
01:32:57,327 --> 01:33:02,749
Take his shoes, man!

715
01:33:06,711 --> 01:33:11,049
Take his shoes?

716
01:33:33,321 --> 01:33:37,867
No screams.

717
01:33:38,368 --> 01:33:42,872
No sirens.

718
01:33:45,333 --> 01:33:48,294
Excuse me!

719
01:33:48,545 --> 01:33:52,132
Excuse me.

720
01:33:52,382 --> 01:33:57,345
I am sorry to bother you.
Would you help me test a theory?

721
01:33:57,595 --> 01:34:03,101
- Sure. What can I do for you?
- Well...

722
01:34:20,910 --> 01:34:29,669
Hello? I have just shot somebody.
I did it on purpose.

723
01:34:32,505 --> 01:34:38,553
I said, I have murdered a man
and I want to confess.

724
01:34:38,803 --> 01:34:43,600
{y:i}Shut up down there!

725
01:34:56,404 --> 01:35:04,829
You look uncannily like him,
only you are much more intelligent.

726
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:09,584
Good morning, good afternoon.
What kind of eggs do you want?

727
01:35:09,834 --> 01:35:13,213
Scrambled.
Have you guys been up all night?

728
01:35:13,463 --> 01:35:15,423
Why did you not tell me
Jack was a cop -

729
01:35:15,674 --> 01:35:21,304
- and that you spent the night
looking at mug shots?

730
01:35:21,554 --> 01:35:23,848
Why did you not tell me
you had no friends?

731
01:35:24,099 --> 01:35:32,232
And why do you go to the movies at
night and make your mother worried?

732
01:35:33,233 --> 01:35:40,949
- You have turned him into a wimp.
- I think not. Toast?

733
01:35:41,199 --> 01:35:48,581
No thanks.
Jack, are you okay?

734
01:35:48,665 --> 01:35:54,546
We talked. I have never just talked
to a woman before. It is neat.

735
01:35:54,796 --> 01:35:57,924
Neat?

736
01:35:58,174 --> 01:36:02,804
Wimp. Next they will be
talking about sex.

737
01:36:03,054 --> 01:36:06,516
Me and Jack are going out.
I am helping him on a case.

738
01:36:06,766 --> 01:36:14,399
Oh, no. Your licence to kill has expired.
Come and eat some eggs.

739
01:36:14,649 --> 01:36:21,114
I have to help. I am the only witness.
Like in that Harrison Ford movie.

740
01:36:21,364 --> 01:36:23,950
There is no comparison.

741
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:27,454
- We are not Jewish.
- Amish.

742
01:36:27,704 --> 01:36:31,207
Irene, do not worry.

743
01:36:31,458 --> 01:36:36,379
There are 8 million in the city
and I am good at catching people.

744
01:36:36,629 --> 01:36:42,802
And the future of the world
may be at stake...

745
01:36:43,136 --> 01:36:47,182
Can you turn this up?

746
01:36:49,851 --> 01:36:52,896
- What is that?
- Mozart.

747
01:36:53,146 --> 01:36:59,486
- The guy Practice killed?
- That is right, Jack.

748
01:36:59,736 --> 01:37:03,990
Do you like classical music?

749
01:37:04,449 --> 01:37:10,372
I do not know. I think I will.

750
01:37:18,838 --> 01:37:23,009
- Did you say who you really were?
- Yes. A cop from L.A.

751
01:37:23,259 --> 01:37:29,307
- I mean really.
- Real enough. For now.

752
01:37:30,100 --> 01:37:34,521
- Are you going to catch him?
- I always catch everybody.

753
01:37:34,771 --> 01:37:37,440
By spotting him from up here?

754
01:37:37,691 --> 01:37:43,738
Give me a break. It is the first
time I have been anyplace real.

755
01:37:43,988 --> 01:37:51,705
This ticket, it worked in one movie.
Could Benedict use it again?

756
01:37:51,955 --> 01:37:56,543
On other movies?
Why would he do that?

757
01:37:56,793 --> 01:38:02,007
I do not know.
But it is a start.

758
01:38:02,257 --> 01:38:07,721
The possibilities are limitless.
But I have realised -

759
01:38:07,971 --> 01:38:12,267
- that freedom would elude me
until Jack Slater was, -

760
01:38:12,517 --> 01:38:15,812
- forgive the pun,
taken out of the picture.

761
01:38:16,062 --> 01:38:22,652
And I thought
you might be inclined to help.

762
01:38:22,902 --> 01:38:28,408
This must all be strange to you.
But if you do this right, -

763
01:38:28,658 --> 01:38:33,705
- the world is your oyster.
Trust me.

764
01:38:33,955 --> 01:38:41,671
You will be free to do whatever
you want beyond your wildest dreams.

765
01:38:41,921 --> 01:38:49,054
And you will never have to go
back to this film again.

766
01:38:49,346 --> 01:38:51,473
You have never heard
of this man, -

767
01:38:51,723 --> 01:38:57,854
- but his actual name is
Arnold Schwarzenegger.

768
01:38:58,104 --> 01:39:03,234
There are a thousand theatres
and we have looked for 5 hours.

769
01:39:03,485 --> 01:39:06,988
- We are close to catching him.
- No, to catching pneumonia.

770
01:39:07,238 --> 01:39:12,369
In my world they just leave clues.
Or they show up and kidnap me.

771
01:39:12,619 --> 01:39:17,457
That stuff does not happen here,
because this world stinks!

772
01:39:17,707 --> 01:39:23,338
The world is what you make of it.
You can give up and go home.

773
01:39:23,588 --> 01:39:31,638
- You believed in me in the movies.
- But here you are just...

774
01:39:31,638 --> 01:39:35,642
Just what?

775
01:39:53,076 --> 01:39:58,248
Jack, there he is!

776
01:40:20,145 --> 01:40:23,023
Are you nuts?!

777
01:40:23,648 --> 01:40:26,317
- You crazy asshole!
- He is just a cabbie!

778
01:40:26,568 --> 01:40:31,031
In the movies they say "Make my day"
or "I am your worst nightmare".

779
01:40:31,281 --> 01:40:37,078
"Rubber-baby-buggy-bumpers".
You did not know I would say that!

780
01:40:37,328 --> 01:40:42,459
- Where did he go?
- He was reading a paper.

781
01:40:43,877 --> 01:40:51,718
- He has been going to the movies.
- That is not the half of it.

782
01:40:52,302 --> 01:40:55,680
{y:i}We are live from New York.

783
01:40:55,930 --> 01:41:01,186
{y:i}We are moments away from
{y:i}the premiere of "Jack Slater IV".

784
01:41:01,436 --> 01:41:04,898
{y:i}And here is the man
{y:i}they have come to see.

785
01:41:05,148 --> 01:41:12,113
{y:i}It is Arnold Schwarzenegger
{y:i}and his wife, Maria Shriver.

786
01:41:12,364 --> 01:41:15,033
- Good to see you.
- Are you a big fan of Slater?

787
01:41:15,283 --> 01:41:19,537
I have enjoyed it.
It was just beautiful.

788
01:41:19,788 --> 01:41:25,168
The National Enquirer.
Do not talk to them.

789
01:41:27,796 --> 01:41:33,218
Do not plug the restaurants.
I hate that. It is so tacky.

790
01:41:33,468 --> 01:41:35,845
- Why go to the movies?
- To get help.

791
01:41:36,096 --> 01:41:39,641
Benedict can do anything.
But we know who he is.

792
01:41:39,891 --> 01:41:42,602
- So he must take us out.
- He cannot get to you.

793
01:41:42,852 --> 01:41:47,148
He does not have to.
All he has to do is get to him.

794
01:41:47,399 --> 01:41:52,112
- Benedict will kill Schwarzenegger.
- Who is Slater.

795
01:41:52,362 --> 01:41:54,989
Bingo!

796
01:41:55,240 --> 01:42:02,038
In this movie we only kill 48 people.
In the last one we killed 119.

797
01:42:02,288 --> 01:42:08,795
But we make up for it with a good
story, emotions, depth, dimensions.

798
01:42:09,045 --> 01:42:13,550
{y:i}There are thousands here tonight
{y:i}and millions around the world.

799
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:18,847
- I directed and produced it.
- This guy is a success story.

800
01:42:19,097 --> 01:42:21,599
- Only in America.
- Only in Hollywood.

801
01:42:21,850 --> 01:42:26,062
And at Planet Hollywood we have
some incredible memorabilia.

802
01:42:26,312 --> 01:42:30,025
It is absolutely fabulous...

803
01:42:30,275 --> 01:42:35,280
You embarrassed me.
How could you do that?

804
01:42:35,530 --> 01:42:40,201
Chris, it is the Ripper
from "Jack Slater III". Scary.

805
01:42:40,452 --> 01:42:44,998
- Let us "axe" him a question.
- Look at this method villain.

806
01:42:45,248 --> 01:42:49,753
Rip, what brings you here?

807
01:42:50,712 --> 01:42:55,925
- I thought I might kill someone.
- You should start with your designer.

808
01:42:56,176 --> 01:43:01,431
{y:i}Nobody wants to miss out.
{y:i}The notables just keep coming.

809
01:43:01,681 --> 01:43:06,394
Excuse me, sir.
Could I see your invitation?

810
01:43:06,644 --> 01:43:11,775
Pete, it is okay. I am his agent.
Jesus Christ, Tom. Come here.

811
01:43:12,025 --> 01:43:18,823
It is Tom Noonan,
the actor who played the Ripper.

812
01:43:19,074 --> 01:43:22,118
Are you nuts? Do you want to
play axe killers for ever?

813
01:43:22,369 --> 01:43:27,374
I need the manager's office for
10 minutes. Here is 50 bucks.

814
01:43:27,624 --> 01:43:30,502
What do you think
Slater says about America?

815
01:43:30,752 --> 01:43:34,464
I do not want to hear it.
I am not a big fan of Arnold.

816
01:43:34,714 --> 01:43:41,096
She is. Arnold turns her on. I just
want to be there when it happens.

817
01:43:41,346 --> 01:43:45,767
Good, you have the props, too.
Whip out a Hibachi -

818
01:43:46,017 --> 01:43:51,314
- and we can make some shish-kebab.
I will rent you a tuxedo.

819
01:43:51,564 --> 01:43:55,860
Tell him it is me.

820
01:43:56,111 --> 01:44:01,241
Did Nicholson go to the premiere of
"Batman" dressed as the Joker? No.

821
01:44:01,491 --> 01:44:09,040
Murray, get me your brother-in-law.
Yes, it is important.

822
01:44:17,924 --> 01:44:23,221
- What do you think about this?
- I would never miss the premiere.

823
01:44:23,471 --> 01:44:27,809
Where am I sitting? Where?
Where am "I" sitting?

824
01:44:28,059 --> 01:44:33,898
There are two balconies.
I believe you are in the lower one.

825
01:44:34,149 --> 01:44:38,903
You stay here. And be careful.

826
01:44:47,662 --> 01:44:54,544
Someone should be checking
the other balcony. Definitely.

827
01:45:02,927 --> 01:45:10,352
Arnold! The deal is done, right?
"Slater V". The soundtrack.

828
01:45:51,851 --> 01:45:53,812
I will be...

829
01:45:54,062 --> 01:46:01,027
{y:i}Jack, it is the Ripper!
{y:i}He has brought back the Ripper!

830
01:46:01,277 --> 01:46:05,907
{y:i}Benedict has brought back
{y:i}the Ripper!

831
01:46:06,950 --> 01:46:10,370
Everybody down!

832
01:46:15,291 --> 01:46:17,877
Get off me!

833
01:46:24,718 --> 01:46:27,721
Get the hell off me.

834
01:46:28,930 --> 01:46:32,017
I should be informed
when there is to be a stunt.

835
01:46:32,267 --> 01:46:36,855
You are the best look-alike
I have seen.

836
01:46:49,909 --> 01:46:54,539
If you get to L.A., call my office.
We can get you jobs...

837
01:46:54,789 --> 01:46:58,752
I do not like you.
You have only brought me pain.

838
01:46:59,002 --> 01:47:02,797
{y:i}Jack, help!

839
01:47:03,631 --> 01:47:08,595
Did anyone come out of here?

840
01:47:09,137 --> 01:47:14,642
Did you see a crazy guy
with an axe?

841
01:47:25,236 --> 01:47:30,075
Hey, Jack. What kept you?

842
01:47:31,910 --> 01:47:37,791
- Are you all right, Danny?
- Yes, sir.

843
01:47:40,001 --> 01:47:42,879
I tried to change, Jack.

844
01:47:43,129 --> 01:47:47,759
I really tried to do
what he told me to, but -

845
01:47:48,009 --> 01:47:55,183
- I kept hearing that old music.
I knew you would come here, Jack.

846
01:47:55,433 --> 01:47:59,646
Lose the piece.

847
01:48:02,023 --> 01:48:07,362
There. It is between you and me.
So let the boy go.

848
01:48:07,612 --> 01:48:12,450
We have played this number before.
What comes next?

849
01:48:12,701 --> 01:48:18,415
You throw the gun away...
We have done that part.

850
01:48:18,665 --> 01:48:24,045
And then you tell me to
let the kid go.

851
01:48:24,295 --> 01:48:29,050
I am getting bored.
Let us skip to the end.

852
01:48:39,853 --> 01:48:45,942
Come on, Jack!
Over here, right here!

853
01:49:13,928 --> 01:49:20,435
I will be back!

854
01:49:25,648 --> 01:49:29,694
The hell you will.

855
01:49:31,696 --> 01:49:34,991
{y:i}Jack!

856
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:38,787
Danny?

857
01:49:40,455 --> 01:49:46,836
Danny, I will be right there!
I am coming! Hang on!

858
01:49:49,047 --> 01:49:52,967
Just hang on now.

859
01:49:53,885 --> 01:49:59,724
- Jack, help!
- I will be right there!

860
01:49:59,891 --> 01:50:04,396
- I am coming!
- Just hurry!

861
01:50:04,646 --> 01:50:09,693
Hold on, Danny!
And do not look down!

862
01:50:09,943 --> 01:50:13,655
Oh, God, please do not
let him die.

863
01:50:13,905 --> 01:50:19,744
Listen, kid. You grab my hand
and we get out of here.

864
01:50:19,994 --> 01:50:24,791
- I cannot, Jack. I will fall.
- Come on, now.

865
01:50:25,041 --> 01:50:28,837
- Trust me.
- I cannot do it.

866
01:50:29,087 --> 01:50:35,635
Listen to me. Hold on with
your legs and let your hands go.

867
01:50:35,885 --> 01:50:43,351
I will catch you. Believe in me.
I will catch you. Get my hand.

868
01:50:43,601 --> 01:50:47,689
Go for it, Danny!

869
01:51:07,250 --> 01:51:12,505
This hero stuff has its limits.

870
01:51:17,719 --> 01:51:22,140
I need a hospital.
My shoulder is out of the socket.

871
01:51:22,390 --> 01:51:25,810
Will a morgue suffice?

872
01:51:26,061 --> 01:51:29,230
Get down, Danny!

873
01:51:32,650 --> 01:51:37,072
Give it up, Benedict.
The lobby is swarming with cops.

874
01:51:37,322 --> 01:51:42,452
I think I can avoid them.
But if not, I have a little -

875
01:51:42,702 --> 01:51:47,832
- explosive surprise for them.

876
01:51:48,875 --> 01:51:57,092
Since you are about to die, I will
tell you the plot. Think of villains.

877
01:51:57,342 --> 01:52:01,346
Do you want Dracula?
Hang on.

878
01:52:01,596 --> 01:52:07,519
I will fetch him. Dracula?
I can get King Kong.

879
01:52:07,769 --> 01:52:12,691
A nightmare with Freddy Krueger.
A party for Adolf Hitler.

880
01:52:12,941 --> 01:52:21,116
Hannibal Lecter can do the catering.
And a christening for Rosemary's Baby.

881
01:52:21,408 --> 01:52:30,959
If I snap my fingers, they will come.
They are lining up. Do you know why?

882
01:52:31,209 --> 01:52:41,052
Because in this world the bad guys
can win! I shall miss you, Jack.

883
01:52:47,726 --> 01:52:53,857
Did you make a movie mistake?
You forgot to reload the gun.

884
01:52:54,107 --> 01:52:59,946
No, Jack.
I just left one chamber empty.

885
01:53:15,128 --> 01:53:19,591
You broke my arm!

886
01:53:21,676 --> 01:53:29,017
Do you see, Jack?
Bad guys can win.

887
01:53:46,242 --> 01:53:48,661
Now!

888
01:53:48,912 --> 01:53:52,624
No sequel for you.

889
01:53:58,421 --> 01:54:01,883
The ticket.

890
01:54:51,891 --> 01:54:58,857
Take him home. To where
this is just a flesh wound.

891
01:54:59,691 --> 01:55:05,530
Do you not understand?
We must get him back to the movies.

892
01:55:05,780 --> 01:55:10,285
I said: Turn around!

893
01:55:13,580 --> 01:55:20,128
Great! They always run away!
Hang on, Jack.

894
01:55:20,670 --> 01:55:27,844
- Danny, do you know how to drive?
- Sure. I have watched you, right?

895
01:56:04,005 --> 01:56:07,509
Get out of the way!

896
01:56:16,810 --> 01:56:21,314
Nick, fire up the projector!
Slater is dying!

897
01:56:21,564 --> 01:56:27,737
- Do you have the ticket?
- No, but it has to work anyway!

898
01:56:39,708 --> 01:56:43,878
Hold on, Jack. You will make it.
This is going to work.

899
01:56:44,129 --> 01:56:47,841
It has to be here.

900
01:56:52,762 --> 01:56:56,808
Please. Nick, hurry!
The door will not open.

901
01:56:57,058 --> 01:57:02,397
No sweat, kid. You tried.

902
01:57:18,913 --> 01:57:22,876
Where are you going?
Back off! You cannot have him.

903
01:57:23,126 --> 01:57:32,052
I have had it with you, Mister.
Who stays, who goes. This one stays!

904
01:57:36,222 --> 01:57:43,104
I was only curious.
He is not on any of my lists.

905
01:57:43,355 --> 01:57:48,318
Though you are, Daniel.

906
01:57:48,526 --> 01:57:56,493
- Now?
- Oh, no. You die a grandfather.

907
01:58:01,581 --> 01:58:09,297
Wait a minute! Help us.
I know you can get him back.

908
01:58:09,547 --> 01:58:18,014
I do not do fiction.
It is not my field. Sorry.

909
01:58:18,807 --> 01:58:22,102
You are a very brave young man.

910
01:58:22,352 --> 01:58:31,111
Unfortunately, you are not
very bright. If I were you -

911
01:58:32,779 --> 01:58:38,410
- I would look for
the other half of the ticket.

912
01:58:45,542 --> 01:58:50,714
They are all gold.

913
01:58:54,509 --> 01:58:59,639
I have got it, Jack!
I will get you home.

914
01:58:59,889 --> 01:59:02,267
You cannot die.

915
01:59:02,517 --> 01:59:06,896
I know.
Until the grosses go down.

916
01:59:07,147 --> 01:59:11,568
No! This will save us!

917
01:59:12,110 --> 01:59:17,032
Throw that silly thing away.

918
01:59:18,199 --> 01:59:21,286
Holy cow!

919
01:59:42,891 --> 01:59:48,104
Let us hear it for Houdini!

920
01:59:49,856 --> 01:59:54,444
Slater!!!

921
01:59:54,694 --> 02:00:02,118
Has anybody seen Slater?
I want him in my office right now!

922
02:00:18,635 --> 02:00:21,221
Help! Somebody!

923
02:00:21,471 --> 02:00:27,769
They got Jack! Doctor, move!

924
02:00:27,977 --> 02:00:32,023
Take this. Get back
before it changes its mind.

925
02:00:32,273 --> 02:00:35,151
No way.
I will not leave you.

926
02:00:35,402 --> 02:00:39,948
I am an imaginary hero, Danny.
You have a real life.

927
02:00:40,198 --> 02:00:48,665
You are real to me.
You are the best. I need you...

928
02:00:48,915 --> 02:00:55,714
Here where you can always find me.
But I need you there to believe in me.

929
02:00:55,964 --> 02:00:58,466
To take care of your mother.

930
02:00:58,717 --> 02:01:04,472
I would love to... You have
your whole life ahead of you.

931
02:01:04,723 --> 02:01:09,769
And pimples
and premature ejaculation.

932
02:01:12,564 --> 02:01:16,317
- What?
- It is just...

933
02:01:16,568 --> 02:01:21,406
I am scared that I will
never see you again.

934
02:01:21,656 --> 02:01:28,913
Whoever thinks that would be
making a big mistake.

935
02:01:35,086 --> 02:01:38,131
Get out of the way.
Do you want a doctor?

936
02:01:38,381 --> 02:01:41,634
Get out of the way.
I am a doctor.

937
02:01:41,885 --> 02:01:45,305
What happened?

938
02:01:52,145 --> 02:01:58,818
Is this a joke?
This is not even a flesh wound.

939
02:02:16,169 --> 02:02:17,212
Where the hell have you been?

940
02:02:17,462 --> 02:02:20,423
Where the hell have you been?

941
02:02:20,465 --> 02:02:22,801
It is working again.

942
02:02:23,051 --> 02:02:26,221
That door is coming out of
your meagre paycheck!

943
02:02:26,471 --> 02:02:30,767
I have the Eagle Foundation doing
a tango up my Hershey Highway!

944
02:02:31,017 --> 02:02:37,565
I do not care about your highway.
And stop shouting. I am not deaf!

945
02:02:37,816 --> 02:02:42,654
You shout because it is in the script.
You are the comic relief.

946
02:02:42,904 --> 02:02:49,119
And do you know what?
I am the hero. So shut up!!

947
02:02:51,871 --> 02:02:54,499
Hollywood writes our lives.

948
02:02:54,749 --> 02:02:59,713
{y:i}I do not want to shoot people
{y:i}and blow up buildings anymore.

949
02:02:59,963 --> 02:03:05,802
You did get to be a magician, Nick.
It really does work.

950
02:03:06,052 --> 02:03:11,016
The ticket is yours, Danny.
And do you know what?

951
02:03:11,266 --> 02:03:16,855
I think the magic was yours, too.
Come on.

952
02:03:17,105 --> 02:03:21,985
Have I told you about the time
my dad took me to see Buffalo Bill?

953
02:03:22,235 --> 02:03:27,782
We met Sitting Bull,
who was his medicine man.

954
