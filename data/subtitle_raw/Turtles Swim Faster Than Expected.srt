00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:30,552
Henceforth, we have been together through anything,

191
00:11:30,553 --> 00:11:32,604
our inseparable relationship continues till this day.

192
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:34,566
The problem is...

193
00:11:34,567 --> 00:11:37,370
-no matter what I do, Kujaku always wins over me.
-Yah! It's done!

194
00:11:38,287 --> 00:11:41,573
What decided it all was our bags- the seals on them.

195
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,370
By the way she sticks on her seals,

196
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,204
was totally cool,

197
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,093
whereas I was always unfashionable and dull.

198
00:11:48,886 --> 00:11:51,355
Certainly, the way we stick on the seals

199
00:11:51,356 --> 00:11:53,399
reflected our lifestyles.

200
00:11:57,452 --> 00:11:58,282
I'm sorry, but...

201
00:11:58,283 --> 00:11:59,080
I'll be dancing.

202
00:11:59,261 --> 00:11:59,870
Huh?

203
00:12:00,108 --> 00:12:01,621
It'll be a little dance practice.

204
00:12:01,704 --> 00:12:02,855
I have to do it no matter what.

205
00:12:03,618 --> 00:12:04,401
Ok...

206
00:12:05,381 --> 00:12:06,189
I...

207
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,924
have nothing to do in the salon...

208
00:12:08,925 --> 00:12:10,241
so I'll be dancing.

209
00:12:12,391 --> 00:12:13,726
Thank goodness.

210
00:12:13,727 --> 00:12:16,131
I was wondering what I should do if you didn't permit me to do so.

211
00:12:17,367 --> 00:12:18,334
Oh..

212
00:12:24,348 --> 00:12:31,389
#That is why you are shining brightly and sparkling, why do I think of you all the time</i>

213
00:12:31,441 --> 00:12:33,557
I don't know why I think his dancing is quite good...

214
00:12:33,558 --> 00:12:36,006
but I'm relieved..

215
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,508
Oh, I remembered!

216
00:12:38,371 --> 00:12:41,820
When I was in high school, I was in the horticulture club.

217
00:12:42,238 --> 00:12:45,451
Kujaku was going out with a big-scaled guy.

218
00:12:49,232 --> 00:12:50,147
Alright ~ fight!

219
00:12:51,387 --> 00:12:54,872
She participated during high school pro-wrestling competitions.

220
00:13:02,603 --> 00:13:04,977
I can't win against her with my sense of style,

221
00:13:04,978 --> 00:13:07,445
so using my creativity,

222
00:13:07,446 --> 00:13:10,073
made a fan that produces north-wind sounds.

223
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:16,195
Yahh!

224
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,471
I was briefly reported about,

225
00:13:19,727 --> 00:13:22,353
and received 1.2 million yen.
[Female university student invents an interesting fan machine]

226
00:13:24,715 --> 00:13:26,912
I went shopping using 100 000 yen,

227
00:13:26,913 --> 00:13:28,577
saved up 100 000 yen...

228
00:13:28,578 --> 00:13:31,394
and I gave the remaining a hundred thousand yen to Kujaku.

229
00:13:31,908 --> 00:13:33,041
All right!~

230
00:13:35,153 --> 00:13:36,074
Heyyy~~~~

231
00:13:36,353 --> 00:13:38,121
I went to the horse races,

232
00:13:41,891 --> 00:13:43,693
I won 2 million yen...

233
00:13:47,752 --> 00:13:48,476
And then,

234
00:13:48,477 --> 00:13:51,865
I was proposed to by a common man,

235
00:13:51,866 --> 00:13:53,240
and I accepted it.

236
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,140
Kujaku is single...

237
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:05,277
hoping that in the future, she'll be able to live with a French man,

238
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:06,738
with a Eiffel Tower view outside.

239
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,562
Kujaku?

240
00:14:10,489 --> 00:14:11,268
Yes?

241
00:14:11,735 --> 00:14:13,341
We will be here forever, right?

242
00:14:14,534 --> 00:14:15,848
Yes...

243
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,002
And this is the current Kujaku,

244
00:14:20,003 --> 00:14:21,977
living her life dynamically.

245
00:14:22,827 --> 00:14:24,455
What's with your hair?!

246
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:26,528
"Eternal Salon"

247
00:14:26,585 --> 00:14:28,103
She made it this style here.

248
00:14:28,104 --> 00:14:29,459
It's strange, isn't it?

249
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:30,459
Huh?

250
00:14:30,798 --> 00:14:33,609
Lame~~~~~~~

251
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,615
Shut up.

252
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,951
What's with that?

253
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:37,907
I picked it up.

254
00:14:37,945 --> 00:14:38,807
Eh, why?

255
00:14:39,072 --> 00:14:39,967
Because I'm lucky.

256
00:14:40,026 --> 00:14:41,046
Could I borrow it for a while?

257
00:14:42,554 --> 00:14:44,258
I like Eraku!

258
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:45,740
-Why...?
-Why...?

259
00:14:47,707 --> 00:14:49,884
Somehow I want to eat ramen.

260
00:14:49,944 --> 00:14:50,981
Sounds good.

261
00:14:50,982 --> 00:14:51,633
Eh?!

262
00:14:51,717 --> 00:14:53,122
Do you know any nice ramen places?

263
00:14:56,267 --> 00:14:56,885
Over there.

264
00:14:56,997 --> 00:14:57,833
It's narrow.

265
00:14:58,741 --> 00:15:00,055
That place is really nice!

266
00:15:00,056 --> 00:15:01,696
Being together with Kujaku...

267
00:15:01,742 --> 00:15:04,335
we went to my favourite ramen shop in town.
[Ramen Sultana]

268
00:15:04,647 --> 00:15:05,363
Here.

269
00:15:07,937 --> 00:15:08,805
Welcome.

270
00:15:17,076 --> 00:15:18,203
What the hell is this?

271
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:20,643
Such mediocre ramen..

272
00:15:20,785 --> 00:15:22,525
There's no taste or flavour to it.

273
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:23,785
Is that so?

274
00:15:24,296 --> 00:15:25,422
I like it though~

275
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:27,279
You're too low-classed.

276
00:15:27,473 --> 00:15:28,564
What's your favourite number?

277
00:15:29,201 --> 00:15:29,859
Six.

278
00:15:29,939 --> 00:15:31,116
What do you like in your sushi?

279
00:15:31,381 --> 00:15:32,017
Kingfish.

280
00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:34,147
So low-classed...

281
00:15:34,413 --> 00:15:35,446
What's your favourite saying?

282
00:15:35,756 --> 00:15:36,341
Um...

283
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,317
Perfection of Wisdom (Buddhist saying).

284
00:15:37,318 --> 00:15:37,817
Ha.

285
00:15:37,997 --> 00:15:38,795
You laughed at me.

286
00:15:39,712 --> 00:15:40,537
That's because.....

287
00:15:41,521 --> 00:15:44,413
IT'S NOT FUNNY!!!! MAKE TASTIER RAMEN!!!!

288
00:15:47,659 --> 00:15:51,440
Even though I haven't seen Kujaku for a while, I really like being with her.

289
00:15:51,441 --> 00:15:54,316
She said as a photographer she has to go to Cambodia.

290
00:16:05,658 --> 00:16:07,323
Suzumu, aren't you coming?

291
00:16:07,678 --> 00:16:09,152
I'm going by bus.

292
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:20,317
And as for me,

293
00:16:20,318 --> 00:16:22,702
I'll be feeding my turtle everyday.

294
00:16:23,113 --> 00:16:24,382
*sigh*

295
00:16:33,748 --> 00:16:35,122
Eh?!?

296
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:36,447
This is no good...

297
00:16:36,448 --> 00:16:38,322
no one can see me.

298
00:16:41,388 --> 00:16:44,081
Right now, the only thing who will acknowledge my existence

299
00:16:44,082 --> 00:16:45,613
is this dog.

300
00:16:55,527 --> 00:16:56,405
If I continue like this...

301
00:16:56,406 --> 00:16:58,643
I'll gradually become smaller and vanish.

302
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:00,401
Is there no hope left?

303
00:17:00,885 --> 00:17:02,394
When I thought about this...

304
00:17:02,395 --> 00:17:03,679
something struck me.

305
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,406
Ah!

306
00:17:04,888 --> 00:17:06,728
[Spy]

307
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,364
The spy poster

308
00:17:14,365 --> 00:17:16,347
what was that all about?

309
00:17:16,873 --> 00:17:18,000
Was it just a prank?

310
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:20,787
Or was that an invitation to an evil scheme?

311
00:17:22,316 --> 00:17:22,688
Ah,

312
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:23,435
hello.

313
00:17:24,473 --> 00:17:27,321
We talked on the phone and he told me to come over in three days.

314
00:17:27,773 --> 00:17:28,794
Thank you very much.

315
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:31,741
All right!

316
00:17:32,572 --> 00:17:33,560
I thought to myself, if anything happens to me...

317
00:17:33,561 --> 00:17:37,825
it'll be fine if Kujaku comes and rescues me. With that kind of naive thoughts, I asked for her help.

319
00:17:58,676 --> 00:17:59,468

320
00:17:59,685 --> 00:18:00,133
Ah.

321
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:01,719
Ehh...

322
00:18:01,778 --> 00:18:03,922
I talked to you on the phone a few days ago.

323
00:18:08,911 --> 00:18:10,432
Sorry for being so rude to you before.

324
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:11,286
That's ok.

325
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,272
Look,

326
00:18:12,273 --> 00:18:13,878
I'm bad at living my life, aren't I?

327
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:14,900
So...

328
00:18:14,901 --> 00:18:15,591
Ehhh?!

329
00:18:15,608 --> 00:18:15,912
Here..

330
00:18:16,044 --> 00:18:16,381
Here..

331
00:18:16,414 --> 00:18:17,031
Sit.

332
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:17,986
Eh?

333
00:18:18,093 --> 00:18:18,685

Ah..

335
00:18:19,401 --> 00:18:20,199
Thank you.

336
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,399
You're really good at finding

337
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,378
that poster

338
00:18:22,863 --> 00:18:24,062
It's wonderful

339
00:18:24,063 --> 00:18:25,090
you pass as a spy.

340
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:25,784
Yea.

341
00:18:26,237 --> 00:18:26,936
Excuse me,

342
00:18:26,937 --> 00:18:28,086
what is a 'spy'?

343
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,962
Spy means spy.

344
00:18:30,703 --> 00:18:32,255
What are you doing, E-chan?

345
00:18:32,289 --> 00:18:32,723
Yes...

00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:33,447
I'm coming, I'm coming.

347
00:18:34,216 --> 00:18:36,046
Today, because of the adverse stock-market factors, I had some work.

348
00:18:36,086 --> 00:18:36,929
She's E-chan.

349
00:18:37,087 --> 00:18:37,916
She's my wife, but

350
00:18:37,942 --> 00:18:38,751
she's a spy accomplice.

00:18:42,912 --> 00:18:44,928
why are you sitting on Azuki panda!

356
00:18:45,176 --> 00:18:46,523
Hey, don't get mad.

357
00:18:46,524 --> 00:18:48,066
Don't let her sit on it.

358
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:49,892
It was near me, what's wrong with letting her sit on it?

359
00:18:49,893 --> 00:18:52,288
Then why did you have to give her Azuki Panda?

360
00:18:52,289 --> 00:18:53,703
Oh well, that's true...

361
00:18:53,704 --> 00:18:54,210

00:19:06,737 --> 00:19:07,262
here, we have someone...

00:19:08,338 --> 00:19:09,663
This is Katakura Suzume-san.

378
00:19:09,727 --> 00:19:11,050
Oh.. may I call you Suzume?

379
00:19:11,182 --> 00:19:11,541
Sure.

380
00:19:11,593 --> 00:19:12,697
You have money, don't you?

381
00:19:12,856 --> 00:19:13,377
Well..

382
00:19:13,378 --> 00:19:14,335
not really...

383
00:19:15,741 --> 00:19:16,664
Suzume-san...

384
00:19:16,665 --> 00:19:18,477
is it ok if you become a spy from today?

385
00:19:18,478 --> 00:19:19,390
We'll leave things to you.

386
00:19:19,587 --> 00:19:20,409
Ehhhhh??

387
00:19:27,906 --> 00:19:29,348
5 million yen.

388
00:19:34,325 --> 00:19:35,850
Funds for your (spy) job.

389
00:19:35,865 --> 00:19:36,358
*gasps*

390
00:19:36,388 --> 00:19:37,036
Nonono

391
00:19:37,161 --> 00:19:38,874
I haven't thought about this yet.

392
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:39,378
Hey,

393
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:40,471
what do you mean?

394
00:19:40,661 --> 00:19:41,926
Are we being made fun of?

395
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:43,478
I am not making fun of you.

396
00:19:43,792 --> 00:19:44,988
But I just wonder what's going on...

397
00:19:45,198 --> 00:19:46,924
Heyy, haven't you explained it properly to her yet?

398
00:19:47,205 --> 00:19:47,664
That's right.

399
00:19:47,665 --> 00:19:48,902
Geez what are you doing?

400
00:19:48,903 --> 00:19:49,655
Because...

401
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:50,388
Actually...

402
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:51,245
we are

403
00:19:51,246 --> 00:19:52,420
spies from another country.

404
00:19:52,421 --> 00:19:52,930
But!

405
00:19:52,931 --> 00:19:55,873
Currently you will be recruited as a Japanese spy.

406
00:19:57,428 --> 00:19:58,576
To sum it up,

407
00:19:58,577 --> 00:20:00,359
the spy said you'll be a spy, did you hear that?

408
00:20:00,415 --> 00:20:01,484
Do you find that interesting?

409
00:20:01,707 --> 00:20:02,572
Yes, it's interesting

410
00:20:04,641 --> 00:20:06,441
Even if you say all of a sudden that I'm to be a spy....

411
00:20:06,442 --> 00:20:07,185
Could you try standing up?

412
00:20:07,524 --> 00:20:08,272
Okay.

413
00:20:11,901 --> 00:20:12,544
She's fine.

414
00:20:12,852 --> 00:20:14,795
She has the potential to be a spy.

415
00:20:14,945 --> 00:20:16,639
I thought so right from the beginning.

416
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:19,995
I have been doing this business for a while,

417
00:20:19,996 --> 00:20:22,094
but the way you're so ordinary is really quite unusual.

418
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:24,282
-To be ordinary is an amazing thing.
-It is amazing.

419
00:20:24,283 --> 00:20:25,890
Anyway, will you be able to take this job?

420
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,190
You didn't say anything about it...

421
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:30,390
Eh?!

422
00:20:32,505 --> 00:20:32,908
Can you

423
00:20:32,909 --> 00:20:33,463
do that?

424
00:20:33,786 --> 00:20:34,211
No.

425
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,668
So ordinary..

426
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:36,700
Damn right.

427
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,304
Nononono...

428
00:20:40,184 --> 00:20:40,866
Hey?

429
00:20:41,548 --> 00:20:43,554
If she's too ordinary, won't it conversely make her unique?

430
00:20:43,694 --> 00:20:45,316
It'll make her a prodigy, won't it?

431
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:46,081
Oh yehh, that's true.

432
00:20:46,082 --> 00:20:47,562
-Hahaha
-Hahaha

433
00:20:49,913 --> 00:20:51,213
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you very much.

434
00:20:51,468 --> 00:20:52,472
Excuse me,

435
00:20:52,496 --> 00:20:55,826
If I become a spy, what kind of things would I be doing?

436
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,069
There's nothing much to do now.

437
00:20:57,283 --> 00:20:57,686
What?

438
00:20:57,735 --> 00:20:59,626
If anything comes up, I'll contact you.

439
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,621
When will that be?

440
00:21:00,622 --> 00:21:01,255
I dunno...

441
00:21:01,699 --> 00:21:04,282
There haven't been anything for 12 years.

442
00:21:04,578 --> 00:21:06,034
Speaking of which...

443
00:21:06,297 --> 00:21:07,531
No way...

444
00:21:07,564 --> 00:21:10,188
Anyways, from now on you'll be receiving special training.

445
00:21:10,229 --> 00:21:12,070
Never forget for a second that you're a spy.

446
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:13,469
I don't get any of this.

447
00:21:13,707 --> 00:21:14,448
Special training?

448
00:21:14,677 --> 00:21:15,450
What's that?

449
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:16,577
To live normally.

450
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:17,745
To live normally...?

451
00:21:17,802 --> 00:21:18,189
That's right.

452
00:21:18,231 --> 00:21:18,847
So to speak.

453
00:21:18,938 --> 00:21:20,616
We're to live as we usually do.

454
00:21:23,747 --> 00:21:24,961
Then why do you have to push me?

455
00:21:24,962 --> 00:21:26,451
Aren't I right, Shishimi-chan?

456
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:27,714
-It's "Suzume".
-For the time being,

457
00:21:27,715 --> 00:21:28,722
here's five million yen

458
00:21:28,723 --> 00:21:29,506
for joining our organisation.

459
00:21:29,763 --> 00:21:30,499
I shouldn't take it though...

460
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,018
Anyway,

461
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:32,821
won't you use this money to do something about your hair?

462
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,854
Does it look weird?

463
00:21:33,953 --> 00:21:35,361
Of course it does!

464
00:21:35,434 --> 00:21:36,473
Gee whiz.

465
00:21:36,498 --> 00:21:37,887
Even Azuki Panda-chan is laughing at you.

466
00:21:38,011 --> 00:21:38,312

467
00:21:38,313 --> 00:21:38,568
Hue he

00:21:38,569 --> 00:21:38,858

00:21:42,118 --> 00:21:43,563
Azuki panda-chan~

479
00:21:47,664 --> 00:21:49,580
So that's how I became a spy.

480
00:21:50,368 --> 00:21:53,103
For the time being, before they contact me again, I'm to live as per usual.

481
00:21:54,087 --> 00:21:55,832
This is apparently spy activity.

482
00:22:00,588 --> 00:22:03,331
Once again, I'm living my usual life everyday

483
00:22:03,332 --> 00:22:05,700
but the only difference is....

484
00:22:07,476 --> 00:22:07,781
Hue

485
00:22:07,782 --> 00:22:08,074

00:22:08,075 --> 00:22:08,380
Hue he he

487
00:22:08,381 --> 00:22:08,705
Hue he he he

488
00:22:08,706 --> 00:22:09,150
Hue he he he hee

489
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,938
The five million yen cash in the fridge

490
00:22:11,939 --> 00:22:13,829
is because I became a spy.

491
00:22:14,621 --> 00:22:16,451
I began to feel really excited.

492
00:22:16,876 --> 00:22:18,597
This feeling is like

493
00:22:18,598 --> 00:22:20,224
back when I was in primary school,

494
00:22:20,225 --> 00:22:21,505
when I pushed a tyre down

495
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,106
these 100 steps.

496
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:33,639
When I think about it

497
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,854
feeding my turtle and spy activities have similarities.

498
00:22:40,553 --> 00:22:41,036
Hey,

499
00:22:41,037 --> 00:22:42,481
have you fed the turtle yet?

500
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:43,793
Yepyep.

501
00:22:44,015 --> 00:22:44,612
Wow...

502
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:45,769
did something good happen to you?

503
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:46,828
Nah...

504
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:52,428
I get excited thinking about doing spy activities wherever I am.

505
00:22:53,102 --> 00:22:55,816
I just want to live as inconspicuously as possible.

506
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:01,053
Hue

507
00:23:01,054 --> 00:23:01,358
Hue he

508
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:01,667
Hue he he

509
00:23:01,668 --> 00:23:01,946
Hue he he he

510
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:02,634
Hue he he he hee

511
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,503
But what do they mean by 'normal'?

512
00:23:09,152 --> 00:23:11,455
How would I put out the futon in a normal fashion?

513
00:23:12,328 --> 00:23:14,781
Was the way I did it previously considered normal?

514
00:23:15,273 --> 00:23:16,946
Or is it the total opposite?

515
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:19,426
What about hitting the futon?

516
00:23:20,135 --> 00:23:21,761
To hit while it's air-drying...

517
00:23:21,762 --> 00:23:22,490
... or not?

518
00:23:24,217 --> 00:23:26,292
Or after I take it in?

519
00:23:56,171 --> 00:23:57,692
Thank you very much.

520
00:23:57,764 --> 00:23:59,952
Somehow, my life has changed,

521
00:23:59,953 --> 00:24:01,238
and I returned back to my old hairstyle.

522
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,540
I bought myself a gift too.

523
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,284
To commemorate myself becoming a spy.

524
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:19,894
[Glasses, Watches]

525
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:22,027
Yes?

526
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:23,158
It's Etsuko.

527
00:24:23,634 --> 00:24:25,240
What are you doing?

528
00:24:25,522 --> 00:24:27,990
Take off your sunglasses and go to the family restaurant ahead.

529
00:24:28,735 --> 00:24:29,442
Yes...

530
00:24:39,928 --> 00:24:41,072
Hello.

531
00:24:43,438 --> 00:24:44,491
That's a worry.

532
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:45,147
What?

533
00:24:45,224 --> 00:24:47,434
Why did you buy that sunglasses?

534
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:50,170
Ahh... well, it gives me the feeling of being a spy...

535
00:24:50,171 --> 00:24:50,981
Shhh!!!

536
00:24:53,911 --> 00:24:57,226
Ah, I don't understand at all. Who are you talking about being like a spy?

537
00:24:57,522 --> 00:24:58,627
Oh, I see.

538
00:24:59,913 --> 00:25:01,299
Why did I say that, I wonder?

539
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,727
I don't know.

540
00:25:02,894 --> 00:25:04,357
By doing something like this,

541
00:25:04,358 --> 00:25:06,042
you will be caught by one of those around!

542
00:25:11,274 --> 00:25:12,919
This person seems to fit the spy description.

543
00:25:13,227 --> 00:25:14,127
Shall we execute her?

544
00:25:14,191 --> 00:25:15,901
We'll make her weep.

545
00:25:16,312 --> 00:25:17,096
Yes.

546
00:25:33,713 --> 00:25:34,471
Stop it..

547
00:25:34,561 --> 00:25:37,042
please....!

548
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:40,679
Why did you make her cry?

549
00:25:40,859 --> 00:25:41,707
Ah, no...

550
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:42,761
I'm sorry.

551
00:25:42,851 --> 00:25:44,072
It's a lie.

552
00:25:45,138 --> 00:25:46,140
Don't cry!

553
00:25:46,141 --> 00:25:46,628
Ah.

554
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:47,195
Ah!

555
00:25:47,246 --> 00:25:48,877
Ah, what are you doing?

556
00:25:48,878 --> 00:25:49,688
I'm sorry, sorry.

557
00:25:51,036 --> 00:25:52,269
Why are you doing that for??

558
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,388
It's fine, it's fine.

559
00:25:53,491 --> 00:25:54,339
How is it??

560
00:25:57,283 --> 00:25:57,835
Ah.

561
00:25:58,285 --> 00:25:59,350
Wipe your tears with this.

562
00:25:59,453 --> 00:26:00,404
What...

563
00:26:01,175 --> 00:26:02,024
Hey?

564
00:26:02,538 --> 00:26:03,450
Why were you crying again?

565
00:26:03,489 --> 00:26:04,954
It's all because you said that.

566
00:26:04,992 --> 00:26:06,034
No way.

567
00:26:06,151 --> 00:26:07,293
It's fine.

568
00:26:08,631 --> 00:26:09,437
Anyway,

569
00:26:09,438 --> 00:26:10,720
before the commander comes,

570
00:26:10,721 --> 00:26:12,123
just live quietly.

571
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:13,129
Yes, yes.

572
00:26:13,162 --> 00:26:14,307
In a way that you don't stand out.

573
00:26:14,689 --> 00:26:15,583
It's not good to be conspicuous.

574
00:26:16,762 --> 00:26:17,822
Excuse me.

575
00:26:18,026 --> 00:26:18,855
Menu!

576
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:19,973
Menu!

577
00:26:20,071 --> 00:26:20,912
<i>Frankly speaking,</i>

578
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,742
<i>you're the one being most conspicuous here.</i>

579
00:26:24,401 --> 00:26:25,329
Here you are, the menu.

580
00:26:27,422 --> 00:26:28,184
This menu too,

581
00:26:28,185 --> 00:26:29,189
it looks like it'll be delicious too.

582
00:26:29,191 --> 00:26:30,369
Hey, hold it there.

583
00:26:34,757 --> 00:26:35,829
From there,

584
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:39,530
please choose an order that will be hard for that waitress to remember.

585
00:26:39,718 --> 00:26:41,151
When the police comes later,

586
00:26:41,152 --> 00:26:44,231
and ask what did Suzume order, she should not be able to answer.

587
00:26:46,514 --> 00:26:48,745
This is the first time I look at a menu this way.

588
00:26:49,502 --> 00:26:52,535
No matter what food I order, it seems like it'll be remembered.

589
00:26:53,386 --> 00:26:55,162
What should I order, I wonder?

590
00:26:56,234 --> 00:26:57,965
May I have your order please?

591
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,689
I'll have roast chicken meal.

592
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:00,240
Yes.

593
00:27:00,497 --> 00:27:02,115
I'll have curry with vegetables meal.

594
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:02,648
Yes.

595
00:27:02,944 --> 00:27:04,635
I'll have lasagne please.

596
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,128
Yes.

597
00:27:12,051 --> 00:27:13,295
Sorry about the wait.

598
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:14,190
Here is your lasagne.

599
00:27:17,478 --> 00:27:18,261
Um...

600
00:27:18,339 --> 00:27:20,353
The order for roast chicken meal?

601
00:27:20,432 --> 00:27:20,879
Mine.

602
00:27:22,498 --> 00:27:23,097
Um...

603
00:27:23,222 --> 00:27:24,549
The order for curry vegetables-

604
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,123
Mine.

605
00:27:27,372 --> 00:27:28,142
Hehh...?

606
00:27:31,615 --> 00:27:32,681
Then the next practice.

607
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:35,834
Choose ordinary items and buy a total of 3000 Yen in total.

608
00:27:35,998 --> 00:27:37,406
Why 3000 Yen?

609
00:27:37,512 --> 00:27:38,709
It's not too cheap,

610
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,006
and not too expensive.

611
00:27:40,263 --> 00:27:41,039
I see.

612
00:27:41,105 --> 00:27:42,303
When you're done, we'll have your receipt.

613
00:27:42,434 --> 00:27:43,297
I got it.

614
00:27:47,264 --> 00:27:49,580
Shopping at 3 in the afternoon,

615
00:27:49,581 --> 00:27:52,225
what would be considered normal for a housewife?

616
00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:54,877
Thinking about it deeply is difficult.

617
00:28:12,304 --> 00:28:13,733
[Camembert cheese]

618
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:16,642
[Camembert cheese]

619
00:28:19,993 --> 00:28:21,824
[pass]

620
00:28:41,431 --> 00:28:42,994
[pass]

621
00:28:49,349 --> 00:28:50,376
That was Kujaku.

622
00:28:51,219 --> 00:28:52,340
That girl...

623
00:28:52,361 --> 00:28:54,222
what is she shopping for?

624
00:29:05,131 --> 00:29:06,169
Here it comes!

625
00:29:06,231 --> 00:29:07,424
Artichoke!

626
00:29:07,794 --> 00:29:09,737
That is quite a conspicuous item.

627
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,276
You may be just shopping, but

628
00:29:12,277 --> 00:29:14,261
this is spy activity for me.

629
00:29:15,312 --> 00:29:15,620
Hue

630
00:29:15,621 --> 00:29:15,969
Hue he

631
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:16,319
Hue he he

632
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:16,668
Hue he he he

633
00:29:16,669 --> 00:29:17,399
Hue he he he hee

634
00:29:22,416 --> 00:29:23,281
Suzume.

635
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:26,365
Oh, hey.

636
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:27,620
Kujaku is shopping too?

637
00:29:27,795 --> 00:29:29,245
What did you buy?

638
00:29:29,348 --> 00:29:30,530
Nothing much.

639
00:29:31,086 --> 00:29:33,245
I see. It doesn't look like just anything to  me.

640
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:48,573
What?

641
00:29:48,737 --> 00:29:49,539
Want to come over to my place?

642
00:29:49,611 --> 00:29:50,186
Hn, yeah sure.

643
00:29:50,187 --> 00:29:52,685
While walking, I left the receipt hidden perfectly behind.

644
00:29:53,435 --> 00:29:55,768
By doing such a spy-like activity,

645
00:29:55,769 --> 00:29:58,371
Kujaku didn't notice it the slightest.

646
00:30:04,643 --> 00:30:05,682
It's Etsuko.

647
00:30:05,754 --> 00:30:06,647
60 marks.

648
00:30:06,648 --> 00:30:07,460
Pass.

649
00:30:07,564 --> 00:30:10,801
The way you handed over the receipt was especially well done.

650
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:13,661
And so this is how my first spy activity ended.

651
00:30:14,782 --> 00:30:19,603
Even though it's not much different to the way I was living yesterday, why am I so tired?

652
00:30:23,115 --> 00:30:24,121
Here, tissue.

653
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,595
There are still many prizes to be won.

654
00:30:25,726 --> 00:30:28,437
You get three tries to get it right.

655
00:30:28,597 --> 00:30:28,888
Ah.

656
00:30:28,984 --> 00:30:30,084
I'll take that.

657
00:30:30,236 --> 00:30:31,308
Just once, alright?

658
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:35,346
Yo!

659
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:36,369
Oh.

660
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:38,985
You came just at the right time, replace me here for a bit.

661
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:39,499
Oh.

662
00:30:39,561 --> 00:30:40,355
Alright.

663
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:45,370
Why I do not complain to Kujaku, there is a reason behind it.

664
00:30:47,602 --> 00:30:48,464
One day,

665
00:30:48,465 --> 00:30:50,836
the town I lived in had a black out.

666
00:30:51,589 --> 00:30:56,866
Being in the park, Katou-senpai, who lived in the same neighbourhood, appeared in his pyjamas.

667
00:31:07,893 --> 00:31:10,738
That appearance left me feeling "puan~" (breathless)

668
00:31:11,504 --> 00:31:14,167
His hair, still wet from the shower, was wonderful.

669
00:31:15,189 --> 00:31:16,040
You know...

670
00:31:16,088 --> 00:31:16,697
Hm?

671
00:31:17,608 --> 00:31:21,353
Once more, I want to see Katou-senpai's picturesque appearance.

672
00:31:21,401 --> 00:31:23,386
When I said that, Kujaku...

673
00:31:26,204 --> 00:31:28,671
for my sake, thought of inflicting an electrical outage,

674
00:31:28,672 --> 00:31:30,871
by going to the neighbourhood's transformer substation,

675
00:31:30,872 --> 00:31:33,613
and cutting the power line with pruning shears.

676
00:31:48,392 --> 00:31:52,948
Thanks to that, I was able to feel "puan~" (breathless) again,

677
00:31:53,243 --> 00:31:56,502
but electrocuted Kujaku's hair became frizzy.

678
00:32:01,477 --> 00:32:04,859
As Kujaku was thought to have gone for a perm,

679
00:32:05,778 --> 00:32:08,411
she was fiercely reprimanded by the teacher.

680
00:32:16,173 --> 00:32:17,298
Sorry..!

681
00:32:17,328 --> 00:32:19,714
Because of this, I owe Kujaku.

682
00:32:19,882 --> 00:32:21,188
Please come again.

683
00:32:22,951 --> 00:32:23,695
Ahh...

684
00:32:23,696 --> 00:32:25,246
Finally!

685
00:32:25,292 --> 00:32:25,808
Eh?

686
00:32:25,915 --> 00:32:26,553
Nononono,

687
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:28,787
I thought, finally, someone like you has arrived.

688
00:32:28,969 --> 00:32:29,591
I see..

689
00:32:29,592 --> 00:32:30,806
Well you see, humans...

690
00:32:30,807 --> 00:32:32,418
have their luck already decided.

691
00:32:32,858 --> 00:32:35,746
You look like you have got luck in you!

692
00:32:36,247 --> 00:32:41,658
Luck can be used on a big-scale, or small scale, it's different.

693
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:42,814
Oh no.

694
00:32:43,254 --> 00:32:45,407
I was told not to be conspicuous.

695
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,078
If I get first prize here, what should I do?

696
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:51,916
Ge.

697
00:32:51,992 --> 00:32:52,919
I'm being watched.

698
00:32:54,591 --> 00:32:56,275
This should be a time where everything's quiet...

699
00:32:56,276 --> 00:32:58,098
Well, shall we have you turn the wheel soon?

700
00:32:58,694 --> 00:32:59,728
I can't win.

701
00:32:59,803 --> 00:33:00,731
I can't be conspicuous.

702
00:33:02,104 --> 00:33:03,274
Please let me lose.

703
00:33:12,378 --> 00:33:12,852
Oh no,

704
00:33:12,853 --> 00:33:14,146
you missed, you missed, tissue tissue.

705
00:33:14,589 --> 00:33:16,317
Isn't it alright to want the tissue?

706
00:33:16,808 --> 00:33:18,233
That's strange.

707
00:33:18,451 --> 00:33:19,292
You have two more tries.

708
00:33:19,494 --> 00:33:20,008
Huh?

709
00:33:20,141 --> 00:33:21,993
What are you doing by yourself?

710
00:33:21,994 --> 00:33:23,582
Oh, where were you?

711
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:24,160
Got a problem?

712
00:33:24,463 --> 00:33:24,758
Hey,

713
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:25,825
did she get a grand prize?

714
00:33:25,826 --> 00:33:27,056
No, she didn't get it.

715
00:33:28,076 --> 00:33:29,893
What are you doing!

716
00:33:30,016 --> 00:33:33,030
I'll be going to France and living with a guy!

717
00:33:33,062 --> 00:33:34,486
Then do it yourself.

718
00:33:34,487 --> 00:33:36,636
Um, anything's fine, I'd like you to spin it quickly.

719
00:33:37,509 --> 00:33:38,420
Alright.

720
00:33:47,703 --> 00:33:49,633
Congratulations!

721
00:33:49,634 --> 00:33:50,686
Thank you!

722
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:54,883
Now we have the prize winners for seine fishing and the barbecue competition!

723
00:33:54,984 --> 00:33:55,997
What is that...

724
00:33:56,753 --> 00:33:59,307
Why do I have to get the second prize of seine fishing??

725
00:33:59,603 --> 00:34:00,193
Because,

726
00:34:00,194 --> 00:34:00,918
you won it.

727
00:34:01,937 --> 00:34:04,724
Besides, is seine fishing a holiday...

728
00:34:04,725 --> 00:34:05,917
or is it work?

729
00:34:06,572 --> 00:34:09,500
If you don't want to go, then don't talk back!

730
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,437
What the hell is with you...!!!

731
00:34:12,658 --> 00:34:13,865
I'm going now.

732
00:34:13,921 --> 00:34:14,997
Go, go to seine fishing!

733
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:15,542
Just go!!

734
00:34:15,908 --> 00:34:17,738
Go to it!!

735
00:34:21,188 --> 00:34:22,083
After that,

736
00:34:22,084 --> 00:34:24,303
I somehow met up with Shizuo-san and Etsuko-san.

737
00:34:24,654 --> 00:34:27,409
They told me a lot about society.

738
00:34:29,046 --> 00:34:30,751
From bacterium research,

739
00:34:30,853 --> 00:34:35,057
when one is delivering various dangerous substances,

740
00:34:35,058 --> 00:34:37,549
because she was scared of accidents while driving,

741
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:40,021
she became a normal aunty taking the train.

742
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,794
[STOP]

743
00:34:41,805 --> 00:34:43,493
Amongst the many Stop signs,

744
00:34:43,658 --> 00:34:44,332
sometimes,

745
00:34:44,601 --> 00:34:45,180
"pots"

746
00:34:45,548 --> 00:34:46,302
instead.

747
00:34:47,528 --> 00:34:48,120
Pots.

748
00:34:50,692 --> 00:34:53,214
Using a hundred quail eggs to make a dish,

749
00:34:53,215 --> 00:34:54,267
it isn't delicious.

750
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:55,457
What is this?

751
00:34:58,316 --> 00:35:00,814
If you left plastic bags outside for a long time,

752
00:35:00,815 --> 00:35:02,301
it becomes like this.

753
00:35:03,232 --> 00:35:04,091
It's art.deco!

754
00:35:09,181 --> 00:35:11,515
By putting Burmese rosewood into water overnight,

755
00:35:11,516 --> 00:35:12,506
it became quite...

756
00:35:12,507 --> 00:35:13,946
a disgusting thing to look at.

757
00:35:17,521 --> 00:35:19,646
Even if it all seems like a perfectly normal life,

758
00:35:19,647 --> 00:35:22,351
there are a lot of things that I don't know about.

759
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,792
I didn't know it...

760
00:35:32,793 --> 00:35:34,303
this espresso is delicious.

761
00:35:34,353 --> 00:35:35,148
Isn't it?

762
00:35:35,149 --> 00:35:39,122
I knew it, I think the most delicious espresso in Japan is from here.

763
00:35:39,635 --> 00:35:41,803
Ramen is only just moderate though.

764
00:35:41,961 --> 00:35:42,924
I'm sorry about that.

765
00:35:42,925 --> 00:35:45,699
Rather than ramen, why is your espresso delicious?

766
00:35:46,361 --> 00:35:48,126
Just water is fine, isn't it?

767
00:35:48,127 --> 00:35:50,533
Then perhaps the ramen will be delicious.

768
00:35:51,856 --> 00:35:52,781
That's true.

769
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:54,689
I wonder why.

770
00:35:54,757 --> 00:35:56,178
Think about it yourself.

771
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,616
It's fine.

772
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:01,268
Isn't it?

773
00:36:01,842 --> 00:36:02,533
Yeah...

774
00:36:03,146 --> 00:36:04,392
How about making this into a cafe?

775
00:36:04,441 --> 00:36:05,444
No way.

776
00:36:05,755 --> 00:36:06,494
Then fine.

777
00:36:06,582 --> 00:36:07,837
I'll just come to drink espresso.

778
00:36:07,876 --> 00:36:10,290
If you don't eat ramen, I won't serve out espresso.

779
00:36:10,339 --> 00:36:11,789
Just saying...

780
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:14,302
why does this ramen taste so terrible?

781
00:36:14,418 --> 00:36:15,285
Can't help it.

782
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:18,419
It's not the ramen, you just criticise too much.

783
00:36:18,449 --> 00:36:19,666
Look who's talking.

784
00:36:19,754 --> 00:36:20,367
How much?

785
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:21,516
Thank you.

786
00:36:21,593 --> 00:36:23,365
It costs 630 yen.

787
00:36:25,117 --> 00:36:25,477
Here you go.

788
00:36:25,526 --> 00:36:26,275
Thanks for the meal.

789
00:36:26,295 --> 00:36:27,453
Thank you.

790
00:36:45,554 --> 00:36:47,585
So it's her, the new recruitment?

791
00:36:47,634 --> 00:36:48,338
Yup,

792
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:50,651
she's an extremely normal spy.

793
00:36:50,724 --> 00:36:51,625
She's called Shishimi-chan.

794
00:36:51,893 --> 00:36:52,973
It's Suzume.

795
00:36:53,512 --> 00:36:54,370
I see.

796
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,164
Nice to meet you.

797
00:36:56,251 --> 00:36:56,923
Hm?

798
00:36:57,127 --> 00:36:58,793
The owner of the ramen store is a spy?

799
00:36:58,794 --> 00:36:59,496
Yup.

800
00:36:59,512 --> 00:37:01,263
How many years has it been?

801
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:03,929
As a ramen owner...

802
00:37:04,367 --> 00:37:05,937
14 years perhaps?

803
00:37:06,264 --> 00:37:07,469
And he hasn't been discovered.

804
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:09,216
Neither has he improved.

805
00:37:09,515 --> 00:37:12,738
It's not like he doesn't have the talent to make it though, a better taste.

806
00:37:12,739 --> 00:37:14,273
An inconspicuous ramen flavour?

807
00:37:14,467 --> 00:37:14,954
Yes.

808
00:37:15,452 --> 00:37:16,706
An inconspicuous flavour.

809
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:18,373
It's amazing.

810
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:21,815
To make it delicious would be easy,

811
00:37:21,816 --> 00:37:22,216
but,

812
00:37:22,217 --> 00:37:24,005
if it's delicious and gets popular,

813
00:37:24,006 --> 00:37:25,414
it will stand out.

814
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:29,815
To make mediocre food that is also edible is difficult indeed.

815
00:37:30,212 --> 00:37:32,767
Everyone says the ramen here is mediocre too.

816
00:37:35,298 --> 00:37:36,760
It's amazing isn't it?

817
00:37:36,782 --> 00:37:38,872
Mission has been hugely successful.

818
00:37:39,849 --> 00:37:40,710
Kind of.

819
00:37:42,015 --> 00:37:43,839
But if that is an act,

820
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,580
you can actually make delicious ramen, right?

821
00:37:45,677 --> 00:37:46,834
But of course.

822
00:37:48,731 --> 00:37:50,299
Ahh..

823
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,676
someday...

824
00:37:51,677 --> 00:37:53,111
according to my own liking,

825
00:37:53,112 --> 00:37:55,494
I want to try making delicious ramen...

826
00:37:56,264 --> 00:37:59,311
So the mediocre ramen had such deep meaning to it.

827
00:37:59,499 --> 00:38:00,837
Why are you crying?

828
00:38:07,256 --> 00:38:07,803
Ah.

829
00:38:07,887 --> 00:38:08,897
Mail!

830
00:38:09,201 --> 00:38:11,195
Shizuo-san, who is it from?

831
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:12,933
Etsuko-san, it's better if you checked.

832
00:38:12,934 --> 00:38:13,578
Shut up!

833
00:38:13,675 --> 00:38:14,150
What?

834
00:38:14,963 --> 00:38:15,862
Etsuko.

835
00:38:17,273 --> 00:38:17,942
I got it.

836
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,303
Suzume,

837
00:38:19,304 --> 00:38:20,131
that's it for today.

838
00:38:20,387 --> 00:38:21,431
If anything happens,

839
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:22,247
we'll contact you.

840
00:38:26,415 --> 00:38:28,615
I don't know what happened,

841
00:38:28,616 --> 00:38:30,961
but it was no mood to be asking questions.

842
00:38:35,162 --> 00:38:36,894
After a few days,

843
00:38:36,895 --> 00:38:39,350
I couldn't get through to them on the phone.

844
00:38:45,851 --> 00:38:51,024
[Kugitani]

845
00:38:58,477 --> 00:39:00,972
Even when I went to visit, no one was in.

846
00:39:03,058 --> 00:39:04,414
A while later,

847
00:39:04,415 --> 00:39:06,274
Etsuko-san contacted me.

848
00:39:24,331 --> 00:39:25,211
Hello.

849
00:39:25,802 --> 00:39:27,094
Plumbing service!

850
00:39:28,121 --> 00:39:29,388
You're late!

851
00:39:29,765 --> 00:39:30,120
Be careful!!

852
00:39:30,144 --> 00:39:30,432
Oh.

853
00:39:30,457 --> 00:39:31,534
Be carefullll!!

854
00:39:31,731 --> 00:39:32,356
I'm sorry!!

855
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:33,487
Hey!!

856
00:39:34,028 --> 00:39:35,113
Sorry.

857
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,844
Although you're a plumber, you sure repaired it well.

858
00:39:37,845 --> 00:39:39,416
Well, I somehow did it.

859
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:40,526
What?

860
00:39:40,642 --> 00:39:41,299
What...

861
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,855
is it some sort of hobby, repairing doors?

862
00:39:44,319 --> 00:39:45,462
Cut it out.

863
00:39:45,643 --> 00:39:47,000
So what do you need repaired?

864
00:39:47,773 --> 00:39:48,405
Well,

865
00:39:48,406 --> 00:39:50,600
it's the toilet...

866
00:39:50,601 --> 00:39:52,787
can you do something about it before my wife comes back?

867
00:39:52,788 --> 00:39:55,543
Well, without looking at it first, I don't know anything.

868
00:39:55,544 --> 00:39:57,532
Don't be so cool.

869
00:39:57,533 --> 00:39:58,240
I'm back.

870
00:39:58,241 --> 00:39:58,766
Oh!

871
00:40:00,173 --> 00:40:01,661
Why are you so surprised?

872
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:02,567
Ahh!!

873
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,578
Ahh~~

874
00:40:03,627 --> 00:40:04,910
You're here, turtle girl!

875
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:05,403
What?

876
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:05,945
You know him?

877
00:40:05,946 --> 00:40:07,081
Just a bit.

878
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,405
He's the plumber.

879
00:40:08,775 --> 00:40:10,025
What business do you have with a plumber?

880
00:40:10,124 --> 00:40:10,815
I don't know.

881
00:40:11,004 --> 00:40:12,615
Heh? You requested me here!

882
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:14,365
Well..

883
00:40:14,366 --> 00:40:15,599
the toilet is clogged up.

884
00:40:15,656 --> 00:40:17,515
What did you do?

885
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:20,147
I was just being normal...

886
00:40:20,148 --> 00:40:21,160
would you take a quick look?

887
00:40:21,234 --> 00:40:22,147
Alright.

888
00:40:22,367 --> 00:40:23,350
Well, excuse me.

889
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,358
Excuse me.

890
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:24,682
Go ahead.

891
00:40:24,683 --> 00:40:25,122
Thanks.

892
00:40:27,267 --> 00:40:27,904
Ah, over that side.

893
00:40:27,957 --> 00:40:28,209
Got it, thanks.

894
00:40:28,236 --> 00:40:28,867
Excuse me then.

895
00:40:35,415 --> 00:40:36,078
I....

896
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:36,420
I...I....

897
00:40:36,421 --> 00:40:37,856
I've never seen something like this before!!!

898
00:40:37,857 --> 00:40:38,552
What is it?

899
00:40:38,657 --> 00:40:39,416
Sir!!

900
00:40:39,511 --> 00:40:41,505
It's not from anyone who eats little at all!!

901
00:40:41,532 --> 00:40:42,847
You're exaggerating.

902
00:40:42,963 --> 00:40:43,888
What did you eat?

903
00:40:43,889 --> 00:40:44,856
Just normal food.

904
00:40:44,857 --> 00:40:45,398
Heh??

905
00:40:45,399 --> 00:40:46,635
But it's too big!!

906
00:40:46,636 --> 00:40:48,184
No way...

907
00:40:48,678 --> 00:40:49,557
E-chan, go take a look.

908
00:40:49,625 --> 00:40:50,567
What?!

909
00:40:50,621 --> 00:40:53,790
But this plumber could be telling lies for all you know!

910
00:40:53,821 --> 00:40:54,960
That's not it.

911
00:40:55,024 --> 00:40:55,533
Really?

912
00:40:55,534 --> 00:40:55,885
Yes.

913
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:57,098
Well, can you take one look then?

914
00:40:57,514 --> 00:40:58,750
Then I'll just have a look...

915
00:40:58,751 --> 00:40:59,509
do you have a cigarette?

916
00:40:59,735 --> 00:41:00,314
Why?

917
00:41:00,367 --> 00:41:01,714
To base the size on something.

918
00:41:01,715 --> 00:41:03,578
Eh?? If you look at it, you'll know.

919
00:41:03,687 --> 00:41:03,970
Really?

920
00:41:03,971 --> 00:41:04,386
Yes.

921
00:41:05,981 --> 00:41:07,891
It's way too exaggerated.

922
00:41:08,034 --> 00:41:09,024
Isn't it, Suzume-chan?

923
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:10,276
Well...

924
00:41:14,925 --> 00:41:15,483
So?

925
00:41:16,105 --> 00:41:16,671
Hueh??

926
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:17,980
Wait a second, Etsuko-san!

927
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:20,207
No, I don't want to go see it!!

928
00:41:29,756 --> 00:41:31,481
You did a good job.

929
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:35,646
I have been in this job for a long time,

930
00:41:35,647 --> 00:41:37,602
I don't think I'll ever see a situation like that again.

931
00:41:37,603 --> 00:41:38,735
Be careful from now on.

932
00:41:38,772 --> 00:41:39,845
She's right.

933
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:42,407
What am I meant to do to be careful...

934
00:41:42,408 --> 00:41:42,982
well?

935
00:41:47,277 --> 00:41:48,272
What's wrong?

936
00:41:48,403 --> 00:41:50,709
I lost my slipper in there somewhere.

937
00:41:52,173 --> 00:41:53,183
Oh well.

938
00:41:53,409 --> 00:41:55,299
Sir, what is your current job?

939
00:41:57,283 --> 00:41:57,719
Eh?

940
00:41:58,441 --> 00:41:59,120
Is something wrong?

941
00:42:00,456 --> 00:42:02,251
No, not really, but...

942
00:42:03,197 --> 00:42:03,764
I mean..

943
00:42:03,765 --> 00:42:05,308
it's a working day and you're home.

944
00:42:06,412 --> 00:42:07,059
Ah.

945
00:42:07,349 --> 00:42:09,507
I was fired after some restructuring.

946
00:42:09,886 --> 00:42:10,244
Ah..

947
00:42:10,245 --> 00:42:11,313
is that so?

948
00:42:11,824 --> 00:42:14,460
When he gets a job, he gets fired almost just as soon.

949
00:42:14,673 --> 00:42:17,195
The knife hidden under the table..

950
00:42:17,196 --> 00:42:20,265
I just saw something I shouldn't have seen.

951
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:24,612
After many days of restless thoughts,

952
00:42:24,613 --> 00:42:26,844
something bizarre happened.

953
00:42:27,926 --> 00:42:28,748
Welcome.

954
00:42:28,777 --> 00:42:29,628
Ah, Katou-san.

955
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:31,341
Just one person today?

956
00:42:31,434 --> 00:42:31,833
Mmm..

957
00:42:32,524 --> 00:42:33,624
He is Katou-senpai.

958
00:42:34,432 --> 00:42:35,926
My first love.

959
00:42:36,405 --> 00:42:38,337
The reason for Kujaku's electrocution.

960
00:42:39,289 --> 00:42:41,542
My childhood's most remembered memory.

961
00:42:41,699 --> 00:42:42,710
Katou-senpai.

962
00:42:43,725 --> 00:42:45,366
On top of that,

963
00:42:45,367 --> 00:42:47,236
last week on Saturday...

964
00:42:47,888 --> 00:42:50,535
I kept it quiet up till now, but

965
00:42:50,536 --> 00:42:53,125
Katou-senpai liked Suzume before, didn't he?

966
00:42:53,126 --> 00:42:53,883
Ehh...

967
00:42:53,884 --> 00:42:54,777
that's a lie, isn't it?

968
00:42:54,778 --> 00:42:55,621
No, it's true, it's true.

969
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:56,994
No way.

970
00:42:57,073 --> 00:42:57,740
Because,

971
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,826
I heard it from the person himself.

972
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,815
Eh, why did you ask something like that?

973
00:43:01,873 --> 00:43:02,516
Eh?

974
00:43:02,658 --> 00:43:03,847
Because it's interesting.

975
00:43:03,848 --> 00:43:05,253
What is this...

976
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:06,331
Hey,

977
00:43:06,332 --> 00:43:08,563
if he still likes you now, what will you do?

978
00:43:09,468 --> 00:43:12,356
It wasn't anything of my concern what she talked about,

979
00:43:12,357 --> 00:43:13,251
I was surprised.

980
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:17,287
The Katou-senpai whom I saw after such a long time...

981
00:43:17,288 --> 00:43:19,330
was with a strange son and a strange wife.

982
00:43:20,508 --> 00:43:21,677
Your seat is right there.

983
00:43:22,151 --> 00:43:23,809
I want to piss.

984
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:26,147
You just did just now didn't you?

985
00:43:32,585 --> 00:43:33,718
Suzume,

986
00:43:33,721 --> 00:43:35,727
do you want to do some acting classes?

987
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:37,400
Hey, are you listening?

988
00:43:37,736 --> 00:43:38,220
Heh?

989
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:38,741
Ah.

990
00:43:38,946 --> 00:43:39,830
What kind of acting?

991
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:41,392
I don't know that yet.

992
00:43:42,023 --> 00:43:43,739
But once you start getting into it,

993
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,133
you'll have to keep attending it, so...

994
00:43:45,134 --> 00:43:46,434
Wait, what are you doing?

995
00:43:46,921 --> 00:43:48,093
Tip of chicken wing Nazi.

996
00:43:48,936 --> 00:43:49,584
Oh.

997
00:43:49,739 --> 00:43:50,335
It is too.

998
00:43:50,417 --> 00:43:51,178
It's a Nazi.

999
00:43:51,609 --> 00:43:52,142
Isn't it?

1000
00:43:52,313 --> 00:43:52,984
Yeah...

1001
00:43:53,695 --> 00:43:54,477
Excuse me.

1002
00:43:54,543 --> 00:43:55,208
Beer.

1003
00:43:55,247 --> 00:43:55,648
Yes.

1004
00:43:56,641 --> 00:43:58,648
This is the first time we're like this.

1005
00:43:59,148 --> 00:43:59,765
Ahh...

1006
00:43:59,766 --> 00:44:00,015
Well...

1007
00:44:00,016 --> 00:44:01,016
that is true.

1008
00:44:04,452 --> 00:44:05,123
Hey...

1009
00:44:05,814 --> 00:44:07,360
Within your body,

1010
00:44:07,361 --> 00:44:08,820
ever since you were born,

1011
00:44:08,821 --> 00:44:11,504
is there ever a place that you have never touched before?

1012
00:44:11,505 --> 00:44:12,070
Ehh..

1013
00:44:12,071 --> 00:44:13,499
no there isn't.

1014
00:44:15,473 --> 00:44:16,111
Um...?

1015
00:44:17,065 --> 00:44:17,776
Wuah!!!

1016
00:44:17,789 --> 00:44:18,559
Eh? What is it?

1017
00:44:20,264 --> 00:44:20,810
WUAH!

1018
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:21,652
Eh, what what?

1019
00:44:21,764 --> 00:44:22,985
I saw something amazing.

1020
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:23,632
Wait, what is it?

1021
00:44:23,658 --> 00:44:24,389
Don't look!

1022
00:44:24,538 --> 00:44:25,237
Ah, you know..!

1023
00:44:26,858 --> 00:44:27,448
Shoo, shoo!

1024
00:44:27,961 --> 00:44:30,724
To people you don't know, you shouldn't bother them.

1025
00:44:32,423 --> 00:44:33,591
-Wooooooooah
-Wooooah
-Woooooah

1026
00:44:33,874 --> 00:44:34,403
This isn't a joke!

1027
00:44:34,419 --> 00:44:34,924
Look!

1028
00:44:34,978 --> 00:44:36,051
Thus so,

1029
00:44:36,052 --> 00:44:39,211
my fleeting childhood love's memory was totally ruined.

1030
00:44:39,887 --> 00:44:41,134
Regardless of it now,

1031
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:42,254
3 days ago,

1032
00:44:42,542 --> 00:44:45,079
I met up with Katou-senpai unexpectedly.

1033
00:44:47,626 --> 00:44:49,284
Hey,

1034
00:44:49,285 --> 00:44:52,874
even until today,

1035
00:44:52,875 --> 00:44:55,628
I get the feeling that I'm missing something very important.

1036
00:44:55,629 --> 00:44:56,719
Yeah...

1037
00:44:56,768 --> 00:44:59,957
That forgotten thing... can I get it back, I wonder?

1038
00:45:00,054 --> 00:45:01,020
Yeah...

1039
00:45:01,631 --> 00:45:03,672
You too,

1040
00:45:03,673 --> 00:45:05,007
do not know what that forgotten thing is?

1041
00:45:05,008 --> 00:45:05,943
Yeah...

1042
00:45:12,857 --> 00:45:13,647
Hey...

1043
00:45:16,978 --> 00:45:19,658
You...

1044
00:45:19,659 --> 00:45:21,613
liked me before, is it true?

1045
00:45:21,728 --> 00:45:25,851
Crap... that Kujaku must've said unnecessary things to him.

1046
00:45:25,938 --> 00:45:29,372
But the problem is with Katou-senpai's receding hairline.

1047
00:45:30,959 --> 00:45:33,523
Hey,

1048
00:45:33,524 --> 00:45:36,117
if you were born again, what do you want to be?

1049
00:45:36,223 --> 00:45:37,683
Heh? Hairline? (Hairline: Haegiwa)

1050
00:45:37,684 --> 00:45:38,302
What?

1051
00:45:38,303 --> 00:45:39,193
Ah, no..

1052
00:45:40,122 --> 00:45:41,447
Hyena...? (Pronounced: Haiena)

1053
00:45:41,448 --> 00:45:42,289
What are you talking about?

1054
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:44,844
What happened to your hair(line)?

1055
00:45:44,989 --> 00:45:46,972
Hey...

1056
00:45:46,973 --> 00:45:50,803
Should I take some responsibility?

1057
00:45:50,804 --> 00:45:52,840
He's already lying to me.

1058
00:45:53,203 --> 00:45:59,523
I'll put my energy into it, I think I'll be a responsible man.

1059
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:00,732
Yeah...

1060
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,390
What do you think?

1061
00:46:03,054 --> 00:46:04,942
Want to be with me?

1062
00:46:06,217 --> 00:46:06,942
Geh?

1063
00:46:06,943 --> 00:46:07,814
Eh?

1064
00:46:15,186 --> 00:46:16,688
I have to go.

1065
00:46:16,744 --> 00:46:18,109
We'll talk later.
