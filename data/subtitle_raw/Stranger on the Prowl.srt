1
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,532
Stowaway.

2
00:01:46,882 --> 00:01:47,951
Get him off the ship.

3
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:50,224
Let me stay,
I'll pay you.

4
00:01:51,191 --> 00:01:52,394
Have you got any money?

5
00:01:53,968 --> 00:01:55,040
How much?

6
00:01:58,038 --> 00:01:59,151
50,000 lire.

7
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:04,545
- I'll send it to you.
- You'll what?

8
00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:08,325
I'll send it you,
little at a time.

9
00:02:11,645 --> 00:02:13,098
Don't laugh at me.

10
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:18,242
Nobody would notice me
down there.

11
00:02:20,277 --> 00:02:21,901
You'd be willing
to go that way?

12
00:02:28,335 --> 00:02:29,679
25,000 lire.

13
00:02:30,242 --> 00:02:31,275
Cash.

14
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,218
When do you sail?

15
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:37,492
Midnight.

16
00:03:33,098 --> 00:03:34,622
It's a very beautiful gun.

17
00:03:35,236 --> 00:03:37,031
There was a time
I might have bought it.

18
00:03:38,394 --> 00:03:40,008
That was a long time ago.

19
00:03:41,331 --> 00:03:43,979
I'll sell it cheap.
I need the money.

20
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:45,352
I don't buy guns.

21
00:03:46,488 --> 00:03:48,433
- Where can I sell it?
- Now, let's see...

22
00:03:49,827 --> 00:03:53,676
The bartender de "Caffè Sport"
maybe he'd buy it.

23
00:03:55,048 --> 00:03:58,229
You'll feel lonely
without it at first,

24
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:03,000
but after a while
you won't care.

25
00:04:03,998 --> 00:04:06,152
That's the best way to it.

26
00:04:17,956 --> 00:04:20,480
What did he want?

27
00:04:22,927 --> 00:04:25,719
- He wanted to sell me something.
- What?

28
00:04:27,823 --> 00:04:32,718
He wanted to sell me
a useless piece of iron.

29
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:19,995
What's the matter?
What happened?

30
00:05:20,215 --> 00:05:23,363
They say they're charging
just to watch the mammals filthy animal.

31
00:05:23,692 --> 00:05:27,270
50 lire, just to watch
the animal love filthy act!

32
00:05:28,297 --> 00:05:32,531
- 50 lire?
- Yes, 50 lire. Get back.

33
00:05:45,675 --> 00:05:49,493
- I'm going to the circus.
- Where will you get the money?

34
00:05:49,613 --> 00:05:51,339
I'll ask my mama for it.

35
00:05:51,378 --> 00:05:53,899
- You can't!
- I can!

36
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,564
I wanna sell a gun.

37
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:44,091
Not now.

38
00:06:44,521 --> 00:06:45,313
When?

39
00:06:46,135 --> 00:06:48,181
Later, later.
Wait for me.

40
00:06:48,978 --> 00:06:50,495
<i>Here they come!</i>

41
00:07:01,497 --> 00:07:03,145
<i>Piero Morelli</i>

42
00:07:06,841 --> 00:07:08,232
<i>Piero Morelli!</i>

43
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:20,170
Quiet, quiet please!
Quiet!

44
00:07:20,577 --> 00:07:23,561
Look, the Rossi Magical Company
has just

45
00:07:23,586 --> 00:07:26,569
signed Morelli
to its great bicycle team

46
00:07:52,952 --> 00:07:56,383
Listen, I can't stay long
I'll keep away from work.

47
00:07:57,542 --> 00:07:59,970
I just wanted to tell you
I'm going to Milan.

48
00:08:01,568 --> 00:08:04,841
- I want to be there to see you win.
- Sure, sure.

49
00:08:06,971 --> 00:08:08,561
I'll be waiting for you.

50
00:08:08,586 --> 00:08:11,632
You'll have to pay your
own way, understand?

51
00:08:12,971 --> 00:08:14,240
I've got money.

52
00:08:15,571 --> 00:08:17,768
And listen,
I've got some new clothes too.

53
00:08:17,793 --> 00:08:19,683
You won't have
to be ashamed of me.

54
00:08:21,843 --> 00:08:24,318
You...
you want me, don't you?

55
00:08:24,726 --> 00:08:26,292
Sure, sure.

56
00:08:44,372 --> 00:08:45,973
Will you look at the gun now?

57
00:08:46,474 --> 00:08:47,380
Sure.

58
00:08:48,162 --> 00:08:49,212
Let's see it.

59
00:09:08,031 --> 00:09:09,628
2,000 lire.

60
00:09:13,216 --> 00:09:15,295
What are you trying to do to me?

61
00:09:15,718 --> 00:09:18,655
After every work,
guns are cheap.

62
00:09:21,534 --> 00:09:23,210
That's all I've got.

63
00:09:26,772 --> 00:09:29,294
It's worth 10 times that much.

64
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,806
Stay...
Stay away from me!

65
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:56,485
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9...

66
00:09:56,605 --> 00:09:57,409
Stop it!

67
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:00,965
50!
- Peroni!

68
00:10:01,169 --> 00:10:03,763
Giorgio!
Giorgino!

69
00:10:05,854 --> 00:10:09,109
- Can I ride him?
- No, no. Not today.

70
00:10:09,229 --> 00:10:12,119
Just for a little way, please.

71
00:10:46,239 --> 00:10:49,153
You'll better get off here.
You're stopping here?

72
00:10:49,246 --> 00:10:53,352
You would better get off!
Giorgio's got a long distance to go.

73
00:10:53,472 --> 00:10:58,362
I'm taking him away...
to a farm.

74
00:10:58,482 --> 00:11:01,307
It's full of green grass,
it’s very beautiful!

75
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,804
Giorgio will stay in a place

76
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,047
for an old horse
to spend his last days.

77
00:11:05,102 --> 00:11:06,071
Now, get off!

78
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:09,223
- Who will buy me a wagon?
- I will buy a little wagon!

79
00:11:09,988 --> 00:11:12,284
- Get off!
- No!

80
00:11:12,801 --> 00:11:15,192
Giacomo!
Giacomo!

81
00:11:15,386 --> 00:11:19,167
Gia... Giacomo!
Please, Giacomo!

82
00:11:38,437 --> 00:11:39,390
Giacomo...

83
00:11:39,468 --> 00:11:43,382
I...
I tried to sell it to a farm.

84
00:11:43,643 --> 00:11:46,545
But he was too old
for farm work.

85
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:49,610
People are heating horse meat
these days!

86
00:11:52,631 --> 00:11:54,888
You've got to know
the truth now!

87
00:11:55,647 --> 00:11:58,647
There are no green fields,
no pastures.

88
00:11:58,788 --> 00:12:01,209
Life is hard!

89
00:12:01,499 --> 00:12:03,679
Life makes certain demands!

90
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,783
Where have you been?

91
00:12:35,903 --> 00:12:39,837
- We stopped to talk to Peroni!
- Peroni?

92
00:12:41,175 --> 00:12:43,677
Giacomo,
we haven't got the money for

93
00:12:43,702 --> 00:12:46,401
next month's rent.
I can't do it alone!

94
00:12:46,497 --> 00:12:50,430
You've got to help me!
That's so much to do!

95
00:12:54,792 --> 00:12:57,928
Peroni took his horse to the butcher!
His horse!

96
00:12:58,048 --> 00:12:59,878
What's that horse to me?

97
00:12:59,998 --> 00:13:03,084
But it's Giorgio
and we saw the butcher shop and...

98
00:13:03,109 --> 00:13:05,600
Who told you
to go to the horse butcher?

99
00:13:06,134 --> 00:13:08,991
But I didn't mean
to go to the horse butcher!

100
00:13:09,908 --> 00:13:13,026
Why can't you stay away
from places like that?

101
00:13:13,733 --> 00:13:16,951
But we didn't go,
we were only taking a shortcut!

102
00:13:17,192 --> 00:13:19,507
He wanted to get into the circus.

103
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:22,334
The circus?

104
00:13:22,726 --> 00:13:26,203
- I just wanted to see the animals!
- Is that all you got to do?

105
00:13:26,323 --> 00:13:29,821
Can't I just go look at the circus?
And who delivers the laundry, who?

106
00:13:30,229 --> 00:13:32,735
But the other children...
Don't tell me about the other children!

107
00:13:37,218 --> 00:13:40,397
I'm all alone!
There is no man in this house!

108
00:13:40,422 --> 00:13:43,394
What do you want me to do?
Steal?

109
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,784
Now look what you've done.

110
00:13:53,864 --> 00:13:55,578
There's laundry to deliver.

111
00:14:05,031 --> 00:14:08,183
And on your way back
buy a bottle of milk.

112
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,022
62 lire.

113
00:14:31,978 --> 00:14:33,936
That's not the way to carry money.

114
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,598
Giacomo!

115
00:16:13,537 --> 00:16:16,290
Listen, Giacomo!
Guido would like to play marbles with you!

116
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:19,365
- With me?
- He's crazy and he's rich!

117
00:16:19,885 --> 00:16:23,251
When we his marbles from him
then he will buy them back.

118
00:16:23,371 --> 00:16:25,363
We'll make enough money
to go to the circus.

119
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:27,770
I haven't got any marbles!

120
00:16:28,085 --> 00:16:29,897
Go buy some
with the milk money!

121
00:16:29,976 --> 00:16:31,593
- No!
- Was not asking you!

122
00:16:31,754 --> 00:16:33,072
What if you lose it?

123
00:16:33,806 --> 00:16:35,683
I want to play marbles with Guido!

124
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:39,307
I want to take all his money away
and then I'll go to the circus!

125
00:16:39,772 --> 00:16:41,561
You're going
to lose the milk money!

126
00:16:41,623 --> 00:16:45,395
- Go sit on the church steps!
- No, I want to see you lose the money!

127
00:17:31,104 --> 00:17:33,246
I haven't got any more marbles!

128
00:17:34,531 --> 00:17:37,805
We'll sell you then!
I don't want to buy any today!

129
00:17:39,212 --> 00:17:40,946
You don't want to buy any today?

130
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:43,501
What you mean
"You don't want to buy any today?"

131
00:17:43,676 --> 00:17:46,341
I'm going to Roseca,
to sell my marbles tomorrow.

132
00:17:46,461 --> 00:17:48,296
You can't do that to us!

133
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,743
Give us our money back!

134
00:17:50,704 --> 00:17:52,680
Look Guido!
They're beautiful marbles!

135
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:55,165
- I'll sell them to you cheap!
- I don't want them!

136
00:18:04,258 --> 00:18:05,818
<i>Police, police!</i>

137
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,805
- Giacomo, the laundry!
- Guido!

138
00:18:16,067 --> 00:18:19,135
- Leave him alone!
- I didn't do anything!

139
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,925
I don't want any
fights in the streets!

140
00:18:21,021 --> 00:18:24,083
- You understand?
- Do I look like I've been fighting?

141
00:18:25,178 --> 00:18:26,830
Alright, move on.

142
00:18:28,084 --> 00:18:29,369
Move on!

143
00:18:31,266 --> 00:18:33,347
You deliver your part
to Dr. Gartella.

144
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,345
Then you go home.
I'll get the money.

145
00:18:36,743 --> 00:18:39,007
Where?
I'll get it!

146
00:18:39,496 --> 00:18:42,250
Don't worry!
I won't tell mama!

147
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,358
You know where I live,
don't you?

148
00:19:59,051 --> 00:20:01,474
This garment was in
Pucci's laundry by mistake!

149
00:20:01,594 --> 00:20:03,285
It's really mine!

150
00:20:04,582 --> 00:20:07,103
Take them over to my place.

151
00:20:08,254 --> 00:20:10,457
Is it written down
for the butcher's?

152
00:20:11,203 --> 00:20:14,728
Well it's a mistake, you understand?
Do as I say!

153
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:40,966
Isn't this the nightgown
I bought for Sig. Ra Pucci in Rome?

154
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,127
It couldn't be.

155
00:20:46,229 --> 00:20:48,236
You see,
it's much too small for her.

156
00:20:50,194 --> 00:20:51,834
See, it's just right for me.

157
00:20:53,058 --> 00:20:55,823
Yes, it is.
Isn't it?

158
00:20:59,501 --> 00:21:04,396
So many fine things
have been disappearing lately.

159
00:21:05,769 --> 00:21:09,012
2 dresses, a blouse,

160
00:21:09,132 --> 00:21:11,705
4 pairs of nylon stockings,

161
00:21:12,072 --> 00:21:15,192
even a silk shirt of mine.

162
00:21:18,497 --> 00:21:23,055
People can be sent to jail
for stealing, can't they?

163
00:21:26,298 --> 00:21:28,409
I suppose they could.

164
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:32,387
Every night,
I worry about you.

165
00:21:32,968 --> 00:21:37,829
You work so late
and then you go home all by yourself,

166
00:21:37,949 --> 00:21:42,295
all alone in the dark streets.
- I can take care of myself!

167
00:21:42,785 --> 00:21:48,384
I think it would be safer if tonight
I walked you home to your place.

168
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:55,308
It would seem strange,
a man dressed like you

169
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:58,229
walking me home.
- Oh, that can be arranged.

170
00:22:07,891 --> 00:22:10,737
I suppose it would be safer.

171
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:22,975
This must be used after all.

172
00:22:25,667 --> 00:22:27,503
Yes, it's mine.

173
00:22:35,427 --> 00:22:37,293
And this is mine, too.

174
00:22:38,508 --> 00:22:41,322
Yes, I suppose it is.

175
00:22:42,057 --> 00:22:44,626
But just remember
I delivered all the laundry like

176
00:22:44,651 --> 00:22:47,068
I was supposed to.
- What are you worried about?

177
00:22:47,164 --> 00:22:50,379
Didn't you hear him say
that these things are mine?

178
00:22:50,499 --> 00:22:53,132
Never mind,
the boy is a good businessman.

179
00:22:53,252 --> 00:22:54,907
Forget about it.

180
00:22:57,262 --> 00:22:58,945
- Signor Pucci.
- Yes?

181
00:22:59,065 --> 00:23:01,852
Now, would you like to go
into business with me?

182
00:23:02,555 --> 00:23:04,360
- Business?
- The marble business.

183
00:23:04,728 --> 00:23:07,267
I'm the best marble player in the city.

184
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:11,061
All I need is 100 lire
and I will give you half of the profits.

185
00:23:11,285 --> 00:23:12,171
Half!

186
00:23:13,135 --> 00:23:15,368
62 lire would be enough.

187
00:23:15,766 --> 00:23:19,345
I'm afraid not.
I never gamble.

188
00:23:19,465 --> 00:23:24,455
- But it's not gamble when I play.
- Business is not like playing marbles.

189
00:23:24,575 --> 00:23:26,811
Business is hard work.

190
00:23:27,575 --> 00:23:30,084
You've got to learn that.

191
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:45,919
- Would you like to invest 62 lire?
- No, I wouldn't.

192
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:15,810
Your papers.

193
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:46,179
What are you doing here?

194
00:24:47,311 --> 00:24:48,933
I'm passing through.

195
00:24:50,431 --> 00:24:52,052
Alright, move on.

196
00:24:53,307 --> 00:24:56,488
- I'm tired.
- I said move on!

197
00:25:35,738 --> 00:25:37,696
Leftovers are down there.

198
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:23,944
He's delivering the laundry.

199
00:27:30,302 --> 00:27:33,792
Did he go the circus?
No, he didn’t.

200
00:27:43,257 --> 00:27:45,905
I would have given you the money,

201
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:47,312
if we had it.

202
00:28:06,021 --> 00:28:08,749
- I'd like a bottle of milk.
- Serve yourself.

203
00:28:09,322 --> 00:28:11,187
That'll be 62 lire.

204
00:28:11,307 --> 00:28:13,625
I'd like to pay for it tomorrow.

205
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,207
Fine.

206
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:20,078
Only take the milk tomorrow.

207
00:29:42,121 --> 00:29:44,655
What are you doing?

208
00:29:46,806 --> 00:29:49,149
What are you doing?

209
00:29:49,269 --> 00:29:51,396
I'm hungry.

210
00:29:52,017 --> 00:29:53,308
Hungry?

211
00:29:53,881 --> 00:29:57,562
What do you think this is?
A restaurant for hungry tramps?

212
00:29:57,682 --> 00:29:59,379
Get out!

213
00:29:59,499 --> 00:30:01,291
Get out!

214
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:05,354
Get out before I call the police!

215
00:30:08,653 --> 00:30:11,282
Police!

216
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,455
Police!

217
00:32:00,144 --> 00:32:02,231
There has been a murder
in the canal square.

218
00:32:02,256 --> 00:32:03,275
Send out the celere.

219
00:32:03,371 --> 00:32:06,251
Alert the marines and police.
Have the canal checked.

220
00:32:06,276 --> 00:32:08,248
I'll have my car
ready immediately.

221
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:45,846
You're the one who called?
Yes, sir.

222
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:49,097
You said there were eye witnesses?

223
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,201
Who are they?

224
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:51,624
- I am.
- We are.

225
00:32:51,702 --> 00:32:54,491
He said eye witnesses,
you didn’t actually see it

226
00:32:54,561 --> 00:32:56,756
- I saw the murderer running.
- Alright!

227
00:33:35,464 --> 00:33:37,663
Come out!
Keep your hands up!

228
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,377
They would have caught me
if not for you.

229
00:34:11,596 --> 00:34:14,744
I was too scared.
They know was I was doing.

230
00:34:23,554 --> 00:34:25,952
I would have gone to jail.

231
00:34:26,046 --> 00:34:27,928
You saved me.

232
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:36,210
I didn't really mean
to steal the milk.

233
00:34:36,235 --> 00:34:39,036
I was going to pay
for it tomorrow!

234
00:34:39,132 --> 00:34:42,023
As soon as I could sell my marbles...

235
00:34:43,027 --> 00:34:45,800
See? Tomorrow I'd paid for it.

236
00:34:50,007 --> 00:34:52,158
Keep away from me!

237
00:35:00,715 --> 00:35:02,644
You stay here!

238
00:35:02,785 --> 00:35:04,512
It's safer here!

239
00:35:11,423 --> 00:35:13,071
Stop following me!

240
00:35:13,096 --> 00:35:15,750
I'm afraid of the dark!

241
00:35:49,668 --> 00:35:54,305
Please help me!
I don't want to go to jail, I'll die!

242
00:35:54,425 --> 00:35:58,798
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me!

243
00:36:01,667 --> 00:36:05,826
There's the circus near here!
Walk me to it.

244
00:36:05,946 --> 00:36:10,032
The police will think it's just a father
and a boy going to the circus. See?

245
00:36:10,558 --> 00:36:12,800
They're just looking for a little boy

246
00:36:13,105 --> 00:36:14,996
if that is me they won't think its me.

247
00:36:17,361 --> 00:36:21,072
When we get there
you won't have to hide anymore

248
00:36:21,097 --> 00:36:24,126
I can take care of myself from then on.

249
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:26,540
Alright, you...

250
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:30,364
You walk ahead of me
until I take your hand, you understand?

251
00:36:31,081 --> 00:36:33,643
Now throw that bottle of milk
in the water.

252
00:36:35,313 --> 00:36:36,746
Throw it away?

253
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:40,107
It will look wrong if a man
and boy walk into

254
00:36:40,132 --> 00:36:42,865
the circus with a boy
carrying a bottle of milk.

255
00:36:42,961 --> 00:36:44,228
Throw it away!

256
00:36:44,348 --> 00:36:47,144
I can't throw milk away.

257
00:36:47,293 --> 00:36:51,422
Milk is food.
It's a sin to throw food away.

258
00:36:56,513 --> 00:37:00,385
And... don't run.
Walk slowly.

259
00:37:34,152 --> 00:37:35,418
Hey you!

260
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,355
Your change!

261
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:36,425
He's gone!
He's gone!

262
00:38:43,281 --> 00:38:47,362
If I was grown up,
I'd spend my money on candies!

263
00:38:47,482 --> 00:38:50,422
Candies are the best thing in the world.

264
00:38:59,792 --> 00:39:02,899
My father can do that!
With one finger!

265
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:08,683
Come on! Come on!
Try! Try!

266
00:39:39,007 --> 00:39:42,497
Bravo! Bravo!

267
00:39:48,759 --> 00:39:50,337
Bravo!

268
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:20,167
He's coming!
He's coming!

269
00:40:28,524 --> 00:40:33,114
When I was young,
I worked in a farm.

270
00:40:33,234 --> 00:40:37,034
I was the strongest man
on the farm

271
00:40:37,607 --> 00:40:41,479
- Do you wanna hear how strong I was?
- Yes.

272
00:40:42,149 --> 00:40:44,826
There was a big rock in front of the barn.

273
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:51,518
So big that all of the horses
and the wagons had to try... Now watch me!

274
00:40:52,025 --> 00:40:55,314
- He's still watching us.
- I know yes.

275
00:40:56,041 --> 00:40:58,412
Watch me.

276
00:40:58,909 --> 00:41:04,875
One day, my father hired 3 men
to dig a hole under the rock

277
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:08,393
and let the rock drop into the hole,

278
00:41:09,656 --> 00:41:13,365
but they dug underneath it.

279
00:41:14,177 --> 00:41:19,875
And slowly,
it came sliding down on them

280
00:41:20,449 --> 00:41:22,208
to crush them.

281
00:41:23,126 --> 00:41:24,541
And then?

282
00:41:27,103 --> 00:41:29,283
It was a good thing I was nearby.

283
00:41:29,971 --> 00:41:34,790
I slipped underneath the rock
and my own two arms...

284
00:41:34,918 --> 00:41:40,496
I held it up until
other men came.

285
00:41:41,215 --> 00:41:45,078
- We all got out.
- Weren't you afraid of being killed?

286
00:41:46,302 --> 00:41:51,465
In those days
I didn't think I'd ever die.

287
00:41:52,152 --> 00:41:54,715
I'd like to be strong too
when I grow up.

288
00:41:54,835 --> 00:41:57,315
I'd like to be strong as 3 men.

289
00:41:57,435 --> 00:42:00,260
Maybe if I took exercises.

290
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,751
Maybe.

291
00:42:04,161 --> 00:42:06,303
Come on.

292
00:42:10,777 --> 00:42:12,957
They really think you're my father!

293
00:42:19,726 --> 00:42:22,250
A more complete description
of the murderer.

294
00:42:23,818 --> 00:42:25,769
Medium height, bulky clothes.

295
00:42:27,834 --> 00:42:29,478
He's here in the circus!

296
00:42:29,598 --> 00:42:33,073
The man and the boy,
I thought he looked suspicious!

297
00:42:44,716 --> 00:42:48,884
Giacomo! Giacomo!
Hey Giacomo!

298
00:42:51,103 --> 00:42:52,250
Giacomo!

299
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:17,818
What's the idea?
Get around the front and pay!

300
00:43:33,345 --> 00:43:36,366
A man and a boy!
Around the back!

301
00:43:45,545 --> 00:43:47,271
I never saw the man before.

302
00:43:47,296 --> 00:43:50,235
I don't know what Giacomo
would do with him.

303
00:43:50,784 --> 00:43:52,586
Block the whole circus off!

304
00:43:52,611 --> 00:43:56,346
Tell the Inspector
there's a kid with him, a boy of 8.

305
00:44:00,835 --> 00:44:01,776
Hurry!

306
00:44:01,796 --> 00:44:06,342
We got to find the right way!
Well, find the right way!

307
00:44:21,658 --> 00:44:23,421
Giac...

308
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:30,244
Let me pass,
I'm looking for my boy!

309
00:44:30,364 --> 00:44:32,382
You can't go in there,
your boy is not here.

310
00:44:32,407 --> 00:44:33,572
What's the trouble here?

311
00:44:34,007 --> 00:44:37,209
My boy, he hasn't come home. I
know there's something wrong.

312
00:44:37,234 --> 00:44:39,018
I sent him for a bottle of milk.

313
00:44:39,114 --> 00:44:41,533
- We buy the milk here.
- Let her go.

314
00:44:41,962 --> 00:44:46,092
- How old was your boy?
- 8. What is it? Tell me.

315
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:50,775
There was a boy seen
with a man we think might be a murderer.

316
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,725
They were seen together at the circus.

317
00:44:52,821 --> 00:44:56,678
- Giacomo!
- Listen, be careful! The man is armed.

318
00:44:57,229 --> 00:44:59,717
- How do you know?
- He tried to sell me his gun.

319
00:44:59,742 --> 00:45:01,689
Why didn't you report this before?

320
00:45:01,785 --> 00:45:06,398
- What did the man look like?
- He look like... a rather hungry man.

321
00:45:06,518 --> 00:45:09,733
And the gun,
what kind of a gun was it?

322
00:45:09,948 --> 00:45:14,565
I don't know about guns.
You see I make drunk men.

323
00:45:14,604 --> 00:45:17,729
I know more about the broken,
the twisted, the useless.

324
00:45:17,808 --> 00:45:21,328
Alright, stay here in case we need you.
And you...

325
00:45:21,448 --> 00:45:25,214
You come with me.
At least you'll know as much as I do.

326
00:45:28,549 --> 00:45:30,599
Why didn't you tell me about the gun?

327
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,444
Do you realize
you might have prevented a murder?

328
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:36,124
Why didn't you give him
a piece of cheese?

329
00:45:36,149 --> 00:45:38,946
You realize
you might have prevented a murder?

330
00:46:17,645 --> 00:46:19,389
Now you see where you are.

331
00:46:27,343 --> 00:46:28,445
No!

332
00:46:29,332 --> 00:46:31,932
We'll have to wait until the police go.

333
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:35,053
- You see that ship there?
- Yes.

334
00:46:35,173 --> 00:46:37,348
Can you take me there from here?

335
00:46:46,982 --> 00:46:49,216
There is a canal I know.

336
00:46:49,336 --> 00:46:51,082
They'll be watching your canal.

337
00:46:51,908 --> 00:46:53,652
Not this one maybe.

338
00:46:56,069 --> 00:46:58,057
I wish I could go away too.

339
00:46:59,128 --> 00:47:01,759
I wouldn't come back
until I was rich.

340
00:47:02,494 --> 00:47:04,482
Take me with you on the ship.

341
00:47:04,602 --> 00:47:07,909
I had a cousin once
who swore he'd never come home.

342
00:47:08,368 --> 00:47:10,510
Until he made his fortune.

343
00:47:12,377 --> 00:47:14,060
He was never seen again.

344
00:47:16,447 --> 00:47:20,026
When you get old
I could take care of you.

345
00:47:23,239 --> 00:47:25,533
Take me with you.

346
00:48:09,711 --> 00:48:12,434
- Are you alright?
- Yes, move on.

347
00:48:12,862 --> 00:48:15,524
- We could stop and rest.
- Move along!

348
00:48:22,396 --> 00:48:25,242
- Any news?
- They're in there, for certain!

349
00:48:26,343 --> 00:48:29,494
Be careful, there's a boy with him
and the man's armed.

350
00:48:29,953 --> 00:48:33,992
Giacomo!
Giacomo!

351
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:37,296
Giacomo!

352
00:48:39,223 --> 00:48:42,742
The canal is in here,
we better hurry.

353
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:02,190
- They didn't forget about this canal.
- Go home, go away!

354
00:49:02,618 --> 00:49:03,567
No!

355
00:49:03,965 --> 00:49:07,005
The police are everywhere,
we haven't go a chance!

356
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:08,639
I'd love to go with you.

357
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:14,484
- Why did they shoot at you?
- Never mind!

358
00:50:14,604 --> 00:50:16,249
They don’t shoot people
just for a bottle of milk!

359
00:50:16,274 --> 00:50:18,021
Stop talking!

360
00:50:43,989 --> 00:50:47,685
Close the shutters...
Tight!

361
00:50:54,049 --> 00:50:55,101
Tight!

362
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:56,913
Yes.

363
00:52:18,451 --> 00:52:19,846
We found the trail of blood!

364
00:52:19,966 --> 00:52:20,723
Everybody seen them?

365
00:52:20,748 --> 00:52:22,563
No, the trail of blood
ends at the square.

366
00:52:23,024 --> 00:52:25,936
Surround the whole square.
One man every 20 meters.

367
00:52:26,056 --> 00:52:28,110
Go through each house
from top to bottom.

368
00:52:28,212 --> 00:52:29,400
Check everybody!

369
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:31,444
Ah and get the lights set up.

370
00:52:31,564 --> 00:52:34,087
Call the fire department
and get the tear gas guns!

371
00:52:34,207 --> 00:52:37,098
Tell them not to shoot please!
My boy is with him!

372
00:52:37,218 --> 00:52:40,059
The man's armed,
I can't ask my men to risk their lives.

373
00:52:41,356 --> 00:52:43,388
Make sure the men know
there is a child with him.

374
00:52:43,508 --> 00:52:46,619
- Tell them to be careful.
- Come on.

375
00:52:48,179 --> 00:52:49,183
It's nothing.

376
00:52:50,521 --> 00:52:53,294
I'll just stall the flesh a little bit.

377
00:52:54,346 --> 00:52:56,449
Bullet is not in there.

378
00:52:57,376 --> 00:52:59,763
- I have to fray this.
- Let me see.

379
00:53:03,923 --> 00:53:06,555
If the bullet
would have gone into the flesh,

380
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:11,021
I might have been finished.

381
00:53:11,572 --> 00:53:13,744
I guess we were lucky.

382
00:53:43,711 --> 00:53:47,015
- When will she come home?
- She works very late.

383
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:50,534
I delivery laundry to her house
where she works.

384
00:54:10,835 --> 00:54:13,037
Sig. Ra Pucci might be upset.

385
00:54:13,619 --> 00:54:15,791
Maybe some other night
you could walk me home.

386
00:54:16,403 --> 00:54:18,942
No, tonight.
Now.

387
00:54:31,512 --> 00:54:34,479
What big farming country
will we go into?

388
00:54:36,384 --> 00:54:38,538
A fine farming country.

389
00:54:38,954 --> 00:54:41,940
Rich, black soil, hack.

390
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:45,514
Will we have animals?
Horses?

391
00:54:47,374 --> 00:54:50,262
Never heard of a farm without horses.

392
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:55,547
When our horses get old,
we won't sell them to the butcher, will we?

393
00:54:56,541 --> 00:54:57,574
No, we won't.

394
00:54:58,721 --> 00:55:00,557
We won't.

395
00:55:03,594 --> 00:55:06,548
It's not right after
a horse spent all his life

396
00:55:06,573 --> 00:55:09,468
and done everything everybody
has told him to do.

397
00:55:09,762 --> 00:55:12,724
It's not right
just to sell them to the butcher.

398
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:15,881
No.

399
00:55:16,371 --> 00:55:17,521
No.

400
00:55:19,406 --> 00:55:20,923
It's not.

401
00:55:21,668 --> 00:55:23,944
We'll have them run loose in the sun.

402
00:55:24,311 --> 00:55:26,049
That's the way it should be.

403
00:55:28,619 --> 00:55:30,063
That's the way it should be.

404
00:55:47,134 --> 00:55:49,459
I heard the police car.

405
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:52,029
They're trying to send me to the butcher's.

406
00:55:56,386 --> 00:55:58,662
I worked hard all my life too

407
00:55:58,782 --> 00:56:03,313
but I won't go,
I won't go, I won't go.

408
00:57:33,098 --> 00:57:34,542
How do I look?

409
00:57:36,696 --> 00:57:38,262
Do I look like a tramp?

410
00:57:39,388 --> 00:57:40,612
No, I don't.

411
00:57:42,007 --> 00:57:43,794
Do I smell like a tramp?

412
00:57:44,259 --> 00:57:46,756
I don't, do I?

413
00:58:01,525 --> 00:58:03,361
We've got to get away.

414
00:58:03,481 --> 00:58:05,809
- You and me.
- Sure.

415
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:09,358
Giacomo...

416
00:58:12,025 --> 00:58:14,644
In the left outside pocket
in my jacket...

417
00:58:16,015 --> 00:58:19,423
in the small pocket that's
inside the pocket.

418
00:58:22,435 --> 00:58:24,589
I've had it since I was a boy.

419
00:58:25,299 --> 00:58:27,698
- Have you got a knife of your own?
- No.

420
00:58:28,383 --> 00:58:30,292
Take it,
you're old enough to have one.

421
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:32,568
- It's for you.
- For me?

422
00:58:32,688 --> 00:58:33,817
Yes.

423
00:58:34,551 --> 00:58:36,999
Put it away now
and listen carefully.

424
00:58:37,831 --> 00:58:40,939
This is the top floor,
there must a way to get to the roof.

425
00:58:41,796 --> 00:58:44,733
Find out how,
then find out...

426
00:58:45,051 --> 00:58:47,670
if we can get from this street
to the next one.

427
00:58:48,506 --> 00:58:52,080
If we can get out of this neighborhood,
we can get to our ship.

428
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:53,059
Yes.

429
00:58:57,465 --> 00:58:58,640
Giacomo.

430
00:59:00,084 --> 00:59:01,797
We're friends, aren't we?

431
00:59:04,343 --> 00:59:06,276
You won't turn against me?

432
00:59:07,451 --> 00:59:08,626
Whatever happens.

433
00:59:09,483 --> 00:59:10,657
No, I won't.

434
01:00:14,830 --> 01:00:17,094
We'd better not
go on together.

435
01:00:18,654 --> 01:00:20,307
We'd better not.

436
01:00:20,919 --> 01:00:22,173
You go on ahead, then.

437
01:00:22,293 --> 01:00:25,324
I'll.. I'll...
I'll be up after a while.

438
01:00:27,435 --> 01:00:28,843
Of course.

439
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:36,583
I live over here.

440
01:00:36,703 --> 01:00:38,908
What's the matter?
What are all these people here for?

441
01:00:38,933 --> 01:00:39,667
A murder.

442
01:00:40,324 --> 01:00:41,426
Be careful.

443
01:00:47,116 --> 01:00:49,594
The police asked me
to check everybody.

444
01:00:49,714 --> 01:00:52,287
Are you expecting anybody tonight?

445
01:00:58,283 --> 01:00:59,354
No.

446
01:01:56,001 --> 01:01:56,950
Don't!

447
01:01:57,684 --> 01:02:00,132
Don't make a sound.

448
01:02:05,669 --> 01:02:07,169
Don't hurt me.

449
01:02:09,035 --> 01:02:11,330
I will do anything you say.

450
01:02:27,045 --> 01:02:31,023
Get over to the bed
and don't move.

451
01:02:49,118 --> 01:02:51,046
You don't have to tie me up.

452
01:02:54,258 --> 01:02:57,379
I wouldn't turn you over to the police.

453
01:03:03,406 --> 01:03:04,844
Let me help you.

454
01:03:06,313 --> 01:03:08,760
Your arm is bleeding terribly.

455
01:03:33,437 --> 01:03:35,365
Your police department

456
01:03:35,485 --> 01:03:38,057
will pay 50,000 lire reward

457
01:03:38,177 --> 01:03:41,392
for any information
leading to the arrest of the murderer.

458
01:05:29,079 --> 01:05:30,701
You're very beautiful.

459
01:05:36,851 --> 01:05:38,625
Don't go away.

460
01:06:20,032 --> 01:06:22,592
- How good of a shot are you?
- I'm a good shot.

461
01:06:22,617 --> 01:06:23,697
I'm a great shot!

462
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:31,138
You understand
the boy's life maybe at stake?

463
01:06:31,163 --> 01:06:31,835
Yes, sir.

464
01:06:32,754 --> 01:06:33,978
Stand by.

465
01:06:34,098 --> 01:06:35,507
Yes, sir.

466
01:07:36,528 --> 01:07:39,373
Here is a description of the wanted man:

467
01:07:39,493 --> 01:07:40,933
medium height,

468
01:07:41,053 --> 01:07:42,586
dark hair,

469
01:07:43,106 --> 01:07:44,819
dress in bulky clothing,

470
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:46,930
the man is wanted for murder.

471
01:07:47,297 --> 01:07:48,980
There maybe a child with him.

472
01:07:49,347 --> 01:07:51,825
50,000 lire reward

473
01:07:51,945 --> 01:07:54,915
for information leading to his arrest.
Angela wasn't expecting anybody.

474
01:07:55,466 --> 01:07:59,596
I asked her, she just told me.
Nobody, nobody.

475
01:07:59,963 --> 01:08:02,822
Just stand up for her, ask her.

476
01:08:02,847 --> 01:08:06,259
She'll identify me,
I was with her.

477
01:08:06,355 --> 01:08:08,714
I tell you, it's a mistake.

478
01:08:09,845 --> 01:08:12,018
Bring this Angela down.

479
01:09:21,901 --> 01:09:23,554
It's me, Giacomo!

480
01:09:32,548 --> 01:09:34,629
There is a way out across the roofs.

481
01:09:34,749 --> 01:09:36,312
We can get to another street,

482
01:09:36,432 --> 01:09:37,933
when nobody's watch-

483
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:54,445
Tell you're in bed.

484
01:09:57,229 --> 01:09:59,799
There's a man downstairs,
says he's Sig. Pucci.

485
01:10:00,350 --> 01:10:01,972
Were you expecting him?

486
01:10:03,869 --> 01:10:04,878
Yes.

487
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:07,846
Tell him to go away
I don’t want to see him.

488
01:10:08,733 --> 01:10:10,722
Come down and identify him!

489
01:10:12,894 --> 01:10:14,240
As soon as I'm dressed.

490
01:10:15,617 --> 01:10:17,483
Take your time,
there's no hurry!

491
01:10:48,893 --> 01:10:49,505
She...

492
01:10:50,362 --> 01:10:52,381
She wanted to sell me to the butcher.

493
01:10:53,299 --> 01:10:56,022
For 50,000 lire.

494
01:11:07,893 --> 01:11:09,820
- What's the matter?
- Nothing!

495
01:11:39,143 --> 01:11:40,948
You aren’t helping me at all!

496
01:11:41,068 --> 01:11:44,221
They're looking for you!
You're a murderer!

497
01:11:44,341 --> 01:11:46,638
You killed somebody!

498
01:11:47,770 --> 01:11:49,392
Don't say that!

499
01:11:49,943 --> 01:11:51,503
You're going to die!

500
01:11:51,623 --> 01:11:53,399
Don't talk to me like that!

501
01:11:56,397 --> 01:11:57,682
You always lie!

502
01:11:57,802 --> 01:12:00,038
Giacomo!

503
01:12:00,158 --> 01:12:02,516
- Go die then!
- Nooooo!

504
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:15,366
Giacomo!

505
01:12:15,486 --> 01:12:16,926
Help!

506
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:33,138
Help me!

507
01:12:34,301 --> 01:12:35,708
Help!

508
01:12:36,259 --> 01:12:37,727
Help!

509
01:12:52,199 --> 01:12:53,943
Help!

510
01:13:24,573 --> 01:13:26,867
Get around the back
and up the tower.

511
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:34,146
Giacomo, Giacomo!

512
01:13:35,370 --> 01:13:38,215
Giacomo!
You got to understand!

513
01:13:39,010 --> 01:13:42,468
I didn't mean to kill her,
I didn't mean to hurt her.

514
01:13:43,079 --> 01:13:44,732
I was hungry.

515
01:13:46,243 --> 01:13:47,164
Once,

516
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:50,392
once people used to love
to watch me eat and

517
01:13:51,004 --> 01:13:53,757
now that I can't work,
they throw me out.

518
01:13:54,583 --> 01:13:56,480
When I tell people I'm hungry

519
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,928
they're afraid
I'll steal a piece of bread.

520
01:13:59,048 --> 01:14:00,891
When I'm cold and
tired,

521
01:14:00,916 --> 01:14:02,711
they're afraid
I'll rest somewhere I shouldn't.

522
01:14:04,645 --> 01:14:05,471
They're...

523
01:14:06,236 --> 01:14:08,255
They're all waiting for me to die!

524
01:14:09,295 --> 01:14:10,519
But I'm a man.

525
01:14:13,150 --> 01:14:14,649
I have a right to be hungry!

526
01:14:15,934 --> 01:14:17,433
I have a right to eat!

527
01:14:18,107 --> 01:14:19,545
I have a right to live!

528
01:14:20,003 --> 01:14:22,818
Go down and tell them!

529
01:14:25,388 --> 01:14:26,734
They won't listen.

530
01:14:26,948 --> 01:14:27,866
They will!

531
01:14:33,094 --> 01:14:34,377
Wait and see.

532
01:14:36,362 --> 01:14:37,144
Listen!

533
01:14:37,715 --> 01:14:38,958
I wanna tell you-

534
01:14:39,078 --> 01:14:41,545
You're are surrounded from all sides,
there is no escape!

535
01:14:42,404 --> 01:14:43,948
Send the boy down
before you!

536
01:14:44,549 --> 01:14:46,614
You've got 2 minutes to come down!

537
01:14:47,948 --> 01:14:48,740
You see?

538
01:14:49,772 --> 01:14:50,704
I'll tell them!

539
01:14:51,055 --> 01:14:52,920
I'll tell me
what you told me!

540
01:14:53,911 --> 01:14:54,683
Please!

541
01:14:54,974 --> 01:14:56,447
Don't hurt my boy!

542
01:14:56,698 --> 01:14:58,753
It won't help you
to hurt him!

543
01:14:59,325 --> 01:15:01,881
Please, let me go!

544
01:15:05,152 --> 01:15:06,395
You're the only one.

545
01:15:08,129 --> 01:15:10,676
All the rest want me to die.

546
01:15:12,501 --> 01:15:15,164
Even that woman!

547
01:15:16,090 --> 01:15:19,125
She wanted to sell me
for 50,000 lire.

548
01:15:21,788 --> 01:15:23,296
Only you.

549
01:15:25,371 --> 01:15:27,134
I want you to live.

550
01:15:27,721 --> 01:15:30,071
You have 60 seconds left!

551
01:15:30,494 --> 01:15:31,814
Giacumm'

552
01:15:32,205 --> 01:15:33,165
Giacumm'

553
01:15:40,797 --> 01:15:42,011
Don't spill it!

554
01:15:43,891 --> 01:15:45,477
It's a sin to spill it.

555
01:15:46,182 --> 01:15:47,611
No, I won't spill it.

556
01:15:56,403 --> 01:15:58,126
Goodbye,

557
01:15:59,664 --> 01:16:00,819
Giacomino.

558
01:16:02,287 --> 01:16:03,403
Goodbye,

559
01:16:03,736 --> 01:16:04,755
Father.

560
01:16:05,969 --> 01:16:06,810
Goodbye.

561
01:16:21,727 --> 01:16:23,097
30 seconds left!

562
01:16:23,217 --> 01:16:24,684
Send the boy down!

563
01:16:36,491 --> 01:16:38,214
Do you know this man?

564
01:16:48,524 --> 01:16:50,326
What happened to you?

565
01:16:53,086 --> 01:16:54,300
I deserved it.

566
01:16:55,573 --> 01:16:58,177
- I...
- Keep away from me!

567
01:17:34,624 --> 01:17:36,700
Don't kill him!
He's a man!

568
01:17:36,994 --> 01:17:38,560
He has no place to go!

569
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:40,636
He just wanted something to eat!

570
01:17:40,756 --> 01:17:43,014
He just wanted a place to sleep!

571
01:17:45,990 --> 01:17:48,007
He didn't want to kill anybody!

572
01:17:48,869 --> 01:17:50,298
He saved my life!

573
01:17:50,807 --> 01:17:52,432
He was my friend.

574
01:18:31,497 --> 01:18:34,473
Don't look at it!
Don't think about it!

575
01:19:02,806 --> 01:19:04,907
Come home with me now.

576
01:19:12,093 --> 01:19:13,620
He had his gun pointed at me!

577
01:19:19,710 --> 01:19:22,471
He killed once,
might have killed again.

578
01:19:50,756 --> 01:19:52,675
Tomorrow we'll go to the circus.

579
01:19:53,242 --> 01:19:54,633
The three of us.

580
01:19:54,753 --> 01:19:56,317
No matter what its cost.

581
01:20:04,442 --> 01:20:05,989
Hey Giacomo!

582
01:20:06,335 --> 01:20:08,430
People are saying you got hit too!

583
01:20:09,585 --> 01:20:11,132
Did you get hit?

584
01:20:12,072 --> 01:20:13,345
Did you?

585
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:23,761
Where did you get hit?

586
01:20:26,557 --> 01:20:27,908
Did you see it?

587
01:20:30,943 --> 01:20:32,314
Was it bad?

588
01:20:37,346 --> 01:20:39,324
Did it tear his arm off to pieces?

589
01:20:39,735 --> 01:20:42,300
We were lucky,
the bullet went out.

590
01:20:43,396 --> 01:20:45,335
He paid for you at the circus.

591
01:20:46,798 --> 01:20:48,521
How did you get into circus?

592
01:20:48,641 --> 01:20:50,323
I made Guido pay up!

593
01:20:50,969 --> 01:20:54,200
And listen, Guido said
he'd play with you again tomorrow!

594
01:20:54,846 --> 01:20:56,608
- He will?
- Sure!

595
01:20:56,728 --> 01:20:58,801
He wants to win his marbles back!

596
01:21:09,236 --> 01:21:12,153
I want to talk to Giacomo,
I...

597
01:21:12,604 --> 01:21:15,697
I can't leave it this way,
you see...

598
01:21:15,991 --> 01:21:19,006
I want to explain to him
about the horse.

599
01:21:20,416 --> 01:21:22,707
I think he understands
about the horse.
