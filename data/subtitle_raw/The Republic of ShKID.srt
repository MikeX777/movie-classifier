1
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,826
Why are you staring?

2
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,990
Aren't your ears firm?
- Test it!

3
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,589
And what about yours?

4
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,185
- What's your name?
- Grishka!

5
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:14,422
I'm Anton, Antonina.

6
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:23,784
- Ha! Are you a girl?
- Aha!

7
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,984
- You look like a boy.
- Do I?

8
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:33,782
Do you know who's my father? The earl!

9
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:37,782
The famous inventor Markoni!

10
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:42,185
- Do you know the wireless telegraphy?
- No.

11
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:52,581
- It's my dad's. He is Italian.
- Italian?

12
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,785
What? My nose is bulbous?

13
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:00,783
It is from my mom.
She is Russian.

14
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,865
- Does she type, too?
- She tiptoes!

15
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,384
- What for?
- For being ballerina.

16
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,862
Do you know Kseshinskaya?
- Well, I do.

17
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:19,788
So, when dad stopped loving her,
she plunged into the water.

18
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,019
Wow!

19
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,670
The divers were looking for her
for 3 days and never found.

20
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,183
Why?

21
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,781
When it's because of the unhappy
love-it is impossible to find.

22
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,780
And my dad, too...

23
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,540
- Drowned himself?
- No... he was...

24
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,781
- The Earl?
- Yeah!

25
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,986
- What was his surname?
- Damaskin.

26
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,981
Zamazkin! The earls don't have
such surnames.

27
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:48,746
Well, he was a kind of earl.
He served as a coachman at merchant.

28
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,862
- As who?
- As a coachman.
The 1 st guild's coachman.

29
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:57,662
Grigory Chernikh, 16 years old, his father...
It's difficult to read.

30
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,548
I don't have father. And I never had.

31
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:03,269
Mother is a laundress,
he gave up school.

32
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,786
And he is suspected of the
burglary of Shuster's haberdashery.

33
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,185
- At first prove that!
- Sit down, sit down!

34
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,988
I can slander you, too.

35
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,789
Besides, Grigory Chernikh...

36
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:26,229
is an orderly, careful, polite guy.

37
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,141
- And he doen't smoke, I think.
- Exactly!

38
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,585
- A humanist!
- It is noticeable.

39
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:34,388
Well, who is ready
to accept Grigory Chernikh?

40
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,906
No, no, I'm fed up.
I have a hundred of such humanists.

41
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,868
And I have a lot of such junk.
I can offer it as well.

42
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,384
But otherwise we
should send him to jail.

43
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,184
All right, in what subjects
did he make progress?

44
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:50,066
- In drawing.
And they even complimented me for one time.

45
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,141
- Fine fellow!
- The painters would prove useful to us.

46
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,300
- You take him!
- No, wait!

47
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,269
- Wait a little!
- Send him now!

48
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,820
I accept him if these things
are given out:2 pairs of trousers.

49
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,708
2 beddings,

50
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:07,189
Upright bolts and screws
accordingly.

51
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,749
And nails won't be superfluous.

52
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,390
And sugar!

53
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,625
And sugar.

54
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:19,979
- One-two, one-two... left!
One-two, one-two... pull up!

55
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:27,420
Grisha! Grisha!

56
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:36,783
Here it is... about love.

57
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,782
Well, don't think about it...

58
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,424
I'll come to you,
swear that you will come, too!

59
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,863
I swear...

60
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:50,228
Juvenile depravity!
What a disgrace!

61
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:57,309
I'll never forget you! Never!

62
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,188
You are my only one!
I don't have anybody!

63
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,068
I love you!

64
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,459
Carry this sugar to her and be back immediately!

65
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:30,063
Good, finish changing
your clothes!

66
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,180
- Is the breakfast ready?
- It's been cooking!

67
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:44,590
The first breakfast!
Wonderful!

68
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:50,220
- What's the smell?
- It's the sealskin oil. The deficit.

69
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:53,666
So, listen:
cook 60 helpings.

70
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,184
Oh, but we have
only 16 kiddies.

71
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,147
No matter! Let them be full.

72
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,588
Ella Andreevna!

73
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,945
Be quite! Quite!
Kiddies are asleep!

74
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,782
Ella Andreevna!

75
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,988
Are you ready?
It's high time!

76
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,985
Wait, don't be nervous!

77
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:25,384
Marta! Marta!
Marta, where are you?

78
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:31,389
Wonderful! Wonderful.

79
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:40,699
The inconceivable architecture.
Marta! Damn it!

80
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,187
I've nearly got lost!

81
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:50,024
In this house there are places
where the human foot didn't step.

82
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,066
Don't be nervous.

83
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:57,060
It is the premiere today.
The curtain will soon rise.

84
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,503
Yes.

85
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:04,181
Marta! Marta!

86
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:27,189
Who is this personality?

87
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:34,782
Hey, who is this personality?

88
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:39,380
Now, Goga, ride him
on the bicycle!

89
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,781
I'll do it!

90
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:03,387
Yankel is here! A Jew!
A typical blond Jew!

91
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:10,947
Who do you look like?
A typical brunet Gypsy!

92
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:16,300
A horse-thief! Let me tell fortunes,
let me know your destiny!

93
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:19,388
Well done, Yankel!
You've guessed him right!

94
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,778
Hey, you!
Why do you pester Yankel?

95
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:27,340
- I'm not Yankel.
- You are Yankel! And I am Sparrow!

96
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,705
Don't be afraid of him,
he fears Kupets himself!

97
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,064
- Do I fear?
- You do!

98
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,788
- Do I fear? Do I?
- You do!

99
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,341
Don't you hear the bell?

100
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:12,379
The breakfast is waiting for you!
Everything is getting cool!

101
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,985
Put the beds to their places
and go for breakfast, quickly!

102
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,901
Put the bed to it's place!
Make the bed!

103
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,625
Why he is sleeping?
Where is the person on duty?

104
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,063
- Who is on duty?
- Nobody!

105
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,789
You are on duty now!
Take it and wake him up.

106
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:43,870
Ofenbah, stand up!
Stand up, Ofenbah!

107
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,781
Okay, what time is it?

108
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,468
Five past ten.

109
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:55,542
- Well, I stand up.
Move it! Move it!

110
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:02,300
When I studied in military school,
I caused Kuzmich to go deaf.

111
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:06,423
When he was awaking me,
I hit right upon his ear!

112
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:09,229
Upon his ear-drum!

113
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,264
How ingeniously!

114
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:19,938
If you are not at the table in 5 minutes,
you'll have your breakfast at supper!

115
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:29,664
Listen, what's going on to him?
Is he offended?

116
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,829
Oh, I am...

117
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,138
- Hungry?
- Yes.

118
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:38,860
Goga! You've been appointed
person on duty! Bring!

119
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,987
Just a minute!

120
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,459
Food!!

121
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:48,059
Not enough salt!

122
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:51,984
Just a minute, kiddy, just a minute...

123
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:55,380
Eat, kiddies!

124
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,590
Kiddies, where are you?

125
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,863
Give me some.

126
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,739
The prog is enough for a
hundred of paunches!

127
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,583
Finish your breakfast and make...

128
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,669
Where are they?

129
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,784
Meftahutdin!

130
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:58,982
Meftahutdin! Who has...

131
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,381
Why you didn't detain them?

132
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:17,384
Bandits! You see...
they snatched out the keys!

133
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:21,989
And they tossed it to that tree!

134
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,382
Bandits!

135
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,624
They've got the keys!

136
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,986
Penetrating guys!

137
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:58,589
Where from the firewood? Hey?

138
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,861
It looks like it's from forest...

139
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,185
The fathers are sawing...

140
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:10,059
And I will take it for heating!

141
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:25,264
What a frau! O dear!

142
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:32,266
Would you like to have these lovely,
not much used boots?

143
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,786
Oh!

144
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,985
Allow me!

145
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:45,388
Wow! You have cooked
the scum for all the Europe!

146
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,229
Oh, kiddies!

147
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:55,780
Oh, oh, oh!

148
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,590
Well, today is not
the best day we could have.

149
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:05,542
The roses are yet to come.
And roses can't exist without the thorns.

150
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:12,625
Oh!!

151
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,222
Well, don't cry, don't cry!

152
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,979
A teacher is a fighter above all!

153
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,106
Stop that, stop that!

154
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,665
How could you become so spoiled
in the face of the foster children?

155
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:37,300
How do you look like?
What a hair-do! Tidy youself up!

156
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:41,389
It's all your fault! You allowed
them to get out of hand! You!

157
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,746
Calm down! A prim young lady!

158
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:48,386
- Oh!
- Take it easy!

159
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:16,378
Our stallion is neighing!

160
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:19,065
A sacristan's voice!

161
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,989
Half-assed Shalyapin! Ha!

162
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:40,466
You chewed it!
And this fellow is bawling!

163
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,980
Let's have a talk with him!

164
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:00,979
Hush!

165
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,863
Stand up!

166
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:01,981
Ha-ha-ha! Rhinos!
Stand up!

167
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,549
Move it!

168
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:12,622
If you're late for breakfast...
you'll have it at supper!

169
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:18,385
Vilmgentel, free gunner!

170
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:32,065
Dirty guys are not admitted
to the breakfast!

171
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,383
The next one!

172
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:38,062
- This way!
- The next one!

173
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,865
Here he is!

174
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:46,185
- What has happened to them
today? -Back your hands!

175
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,058
A roll-call!

176
00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:02,388
Gromonostsev! Gromonostsev is absent.

177
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:05,386
- Delay his helping.
- I'm here!

178
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,582
- Japaridze!
- I'm here!

179
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,783
- Chernikh!
- I'm here!

180
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,868
- Kosorov!
- I'm here!

181
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,783
- Yonin!
- I'm here!

182
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,303
I'm here!

183
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,063
- Golubkov!
I'm here!

184
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,419
- Pilnikov!
- I'm here!

185
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,068
Start eating!

186
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:35,860
From this day everything
will be in another, organized way.

187
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:40,067
Guys, we start the new life.

188
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,860
We won't be waiting
for the new school year!

189
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:48,388
The lessons will start after the
breakfast, from morning till night!

190
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:53,139
You all are the pupils of the school

191
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:56,939
Of individual upbringing,
named in honour of Dostoevsky.

192
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:59,385
- SCID! - What?
What did you say?

193
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:03,384
SCID! Shortly, in a Soviet way...
SChool In honour of Dostoevsky.

194
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:06,588
Yes. Are you Gromonostsev?

195
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,227
Depending on the level
of your knowledge,

196
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:13,780
You are divided into 4 companies
like in the army.

197
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:17,783
Now I'm going to introduce
the teaching staff.

198
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,785
My name is
Victor Nikolaevich Sorokin.

199
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,383
VicNikSor!

200
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:26,588
Gromonostsev! The first
remark is the last one!

201
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:34,061
My deputy... teacher of German.

202
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,780
Ella Andreevna Lumberg.
- EIAnLum!

203
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:41,782
Get out! Stand up!!

204
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:52,779
You'll have your breakfast at supper!

205
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,624
Sorry.

206
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:07,987
A teacher of history... Al Nik... well,
Alexander Nikolaevich Popov.

207
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,389
AINikPop!

208
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:13,379
Chernikh! The first remark.

209
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:17,983
A teacher of gymnastics.

210
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:21,948
Wow! A hefty chap!

211
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:25,110
A knacker from the slaughter-house!
A beefcake!

212
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:28,461
Konstantin Alexandrovich Mednikov!

213
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,501
KonstAIMed!

214
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,220
Chernikh, you'll have your breakfast at supper!

215
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,740
But what have I done?
What have I done?

216
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,183
Don't be naughty!

217
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:50,580
Change your clothes! Be quick!

218
00:23:54,230 --> 00:24:03,104
Oh, kiddies!
My name is Amalia Skuratova.

219
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:05,704
- AmaSku!

220
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,508
What?

221
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:10,388
American Skunk!

222
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:20,428
No, the underwear is not American.
It's our, domestic, from institute.

223
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:23,946
What do you give out?
Hey, American skunk!

224
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:28,387
Let's establish the order!
Old woman! Give us the trousers!

225
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,144
Just a minute, kiddy...

226
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:31,743
- We go to city!
- What?

227
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:34,788
- We go to city!!
- But nobody comes to city!

228
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:40,458
That'll do!
Now you are all go to lessons!

229
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:50,978
You are the pupils of the 4th senior company,
you have a lesson of literature.

230
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,059
I wish.

231
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,787
- Well, how do you find him?
- What?

232
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:11,225
Do you like him?

233
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,502
No. And you?

234
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:24,378
You know, guys, the revolution
made all the people equal.

235
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:27,940
But your teachers,
so to say.

236
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:32,708
Don't want to have
equal rights with you.

237
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:36,066
- They wake us in morning!
- They make us wash ourselves!

238
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,549
They make me do the same!

239
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:50,785
- It seems to me we'll get on well!
- But can you sing?

240
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:54,261
Imagine that I can!
And even not bad.

241
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:57,228
If you can... sing now!

242
00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:01,667
- Should I sing? But what
about the lesson?

243
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,502
There is still time!
It's never too late to learn!

244
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:10,302
Well, what can I do, hooligans.
Can somebody stand at the door?

245
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:13,109
Goga, be a jigger guy!

246
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,388
Everything is okay.

247
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,385
Come on!

248
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:13,466
You sing for 2 weeks!

249
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,745
You must remember that you are

250
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:18,060
A teacher of literature above all.

251
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:22,383
Undoubtedly. That's why there are
Russian classical literature

252
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:27,669
And city folklore in my vocal repertory.

253
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:31,984
Sit down.

254
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,179
What did you say?

255
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,987
City folklore.

256
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,987
Don't marry students
of industrial schools?

257
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,061
They are fat like sausage?

258
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:46,379
They are fat like sausage...

259
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,383
What do you teach?

260
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:55,067
I teach Great Russian literature,
but I introduce a new method,

261
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:58,062
Which deeply differs from yours,
which is of old regime.

262
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:02,100
Do you really beleive it's new?

263
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:06,465
Absolutely!

264
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:10,868
Yes. We won't get on well with you.

265
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,258
Now you can...

266
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:24,787
Don't leave us! Come back!
- Pavel Ivanovich, come back!

267
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:30,542
Farewell, friends, I couldn't do
many things that I had conceived!

268
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:35,658
Excursions to opera, and free
reading of Russian literature, and...

269
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:42,299
- Hurray, herculeses!
- Hurray!

270
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:48,067
Hooligans! Let's kick up a row, such
as the world has never seen before!

271
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:52,229
Victor Nikolaevich, let him sing
instead of this outrage...

272
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:55,905
It may be better if we take him
back for a period of probation.

273
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:57,389
- That's it!
- Indeed!

274
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,222
- Liberals!

275
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:04,784
I dismissed him and I don't intend
to change my mind!

276
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:09,580
I propose to create the government
of our hooligan State.

277
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:12,590
And I propose as a chairman
of Council of Ministers...

278
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,068
With dictatorial authorities!

279
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:20,543
With dictatorial authorities!
I propose Kupets the Brilliant!

280
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,780
Hurray!

281
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,187
Hurray!

282
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:41,501
We declare war to teachers!
Henceforth we call them Chaldeans!

283
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:45,185
Appoint me as a Minister of the row!
The total mobilization!

284
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:52,982
Hooligans! Let's make posters!

285
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:55,982
- Propose him Minister of press!
- Hurray!

286
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,787
Go to classes! Friends!

287
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,782
Hooligans!

288
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:50,788
Hello, kiddies!
It's strange that you...

289
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,589
Don't be naughty!

290
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:12,780
All right! Wonderful!
The Chaldeans accept a challenge!

291
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:16,905
The school is declared to be
in a siege! Nobody will come out!

292
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:19,785
The war will last
till the final victory!

293
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:23,385
- Beat the Chaldeans!
- Hurray!!

294
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,464
Oh God! How terrible!

295
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,859
I'll show them what's what!

296
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,429
No, no, not this!

297
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,386
- But...
- No!

298
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:53,388
One, two, three!

299
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:57,228
Sigh the capitulation!

300
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:00,268
Goga! Bring the sulfur from
the chemical safe!

301
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:04,389
These are the mountebanks!
Should I call for Police?

302
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:10,382
No! On no account!

303
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:13,788
We'll overcome them ourselves!
- We burn!

304
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,986
Meftahutdin, wait a little!

305
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,908
The armistice!

306
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,423
The armistice!

307
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:33,308
Do you know, guys, that you
make a row not because of Arikov!

308
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:40,581
Because of him!

309
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:44,380
Because of him?

310
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:59,469
Who is your ringleader?
We are not the rabble!

311
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:01,381
We have a chairman
of Council of Ministers!

312
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:03,267
- Who?
- He, Kupets!

313
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:06,387
Kupets the Brilliant!

314
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,309
- And are you all the Ministers?
- Yes we are!

315
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,661
Well, let's make the acquaintance.

316
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:26,425
So, you make a row
because of Pavel Ivanovich.

317
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,228
And take out your
hands from the pockets.

318
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:33,061
- What did he teach you?
Many things.

319
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,981
Then, many things, you say.
What exactly?

320
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:38,380
- He knew well how to...
- What? How to sing?

321
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:40,388
Yeah! About sausage!

322
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:46,584
Yes! You grew fond of that
impostor for his sausage!

323
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:02,789
You are smart guys with
a great life experience.

324
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,468
How you could do that?

325
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:19,381
You like music. You scratched
an indecent word upon the piano.

326
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:27,979
- Our song!
- A thievish song!

327
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,145
Why it is thievish?

328
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,983
At our place Lipovka
a pickpocket stole some beer.

329
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:35,858
Ha! It's Gaudeamus!
- Right you are, Ionin, it's Gaudeamus!

330
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:38,630
A longstanding student hymn.
It's Latin language.

331
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:40,223
- And what's the Russian translation?
- Translate!

332
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:44,588
- Here it is: we are cheerful...
- As long as we are young!

333
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,588
But is the translation necessary?
Make up your own hymn

334
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,547
You have the State,
but you don't have hymn.

335
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,779
No.

336
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:56,065
Take this melody of Gaudeamus
and who will write the words?

337
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,378
You!

338
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,668
It'll be great!

339
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:03,982
Why not? Some time I wrote poems,
and they were not so bad.

340
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:07,585
Imagine... even Alexander Blok
was envious of my poems.

341
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:10,264
- It was he, who wrote
"The twelve"? -Yes. Yes.

342
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:12,784
- Could he really be envious?
- Well, imagine!

343
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:15,501
Of course, it was
during the certain period

344
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,024
Of our creative work, when we were
sitting at the same school sits.

345
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:24,029
- But I've lost my ability
to write poems. -Me too!

346
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:33,142
And who composed "The rebel"?

347
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:37,188
Very interesting and
critical newspaper.

348
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:39,183
I did!

349
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:42,499
To tell the truth, it slightly
reminds the yellow press.

350
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:46,786
But I didn't compose it myself.
Jap helped me.

351
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:52,106
Well, fine. Let's compose
the hymn together.

352
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,387
- Let's sing again.
- Yes!

353
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,979
It's interesting to see
a sunflower here.

354
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:33,942
It's the State Emblem.
This is a symbol!

355
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:37,425
Each republic has it's own State
Emblem and ours must have one.

356
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:39,387
- Indeed!
- The implication is like this.

357
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:44,182
Our school consists of pupils
just as the sunflower consists of seeds

358
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,989
- Do you see?
- Yes.

359
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:51,105
You know that learning is light. The
sunflower reaches for the light, too.

360
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:54,788
The principal inventor of
our emblem is Chernikh.

361
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:57,589
- Wow, brainy Yankel!
- Long live press department!

362
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:59,342
Well done, Grisha! Well done!

363
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:01,341
Long live the newspaper
and People's commitee!

364
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:04,183
We are the sunflower seeds
and Victor nibbles us!

365
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,788
Victor Nikolaevich!

366
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:28,981
Guys, guys!

367
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:31,785
- She's arrived!
- Who?

368
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:35,499
- A fiancee!
- A typical blond fiance!

369
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:40,789
- Kick her out from our commitee!
- Let's make herself scarce!

370
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:44,942
It's not my fault,
she comes as she likes!

371
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:48,909
- Turn her out! Turn her out!
- Immediately!

372
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:53,381
Goga! Run and tell her to clear off!

373
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,830
That's right, Yankel!

374
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:57,866
Just so!

375
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,788
- Do you need Grisha?
- Yes!

376
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:06,939
Grisha asked you to kiss off!

377
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:13,261
Good riddance to bad rubbish!

378
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:15,147
Go lay an egg!

379
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:19,189
Farewell and be hanged!

380
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,744
Hey, boy!

381
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:30,703
Stop!

382
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:34,145
- Is it you?
- Me!

383
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:35,466
Wait a little!

384
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:38,587
Leave me alone!

385
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:51,669
Here we are at last.

386
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:56,221
How are you doing, Vitenka,
my dear sonny!

387
00:39:58,110 --> 00:40:01,989
My dear, my dear
blue-eyed boy!

388
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:06,144
I'm so happy I can admire
you before my death.

389
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,700
Let's go, mom. Let's go!

390
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:10,985
You are my little blue-eyed kitten!

391
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:13,584
Guys, Vicniksor is mother's son!

392
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:16,544
- Come on, come on...
- Be careful, mom!

393
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:18,860
- How do you do!
- Let's go!

394
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:24,023
- Welcome!
- Mom, it's Ella Andreevna!

395
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:26,021
- Who?
- Ella Andreevna!

396
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:27,623
Oh, Ella Andreevna! I see.

397
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,587
Vicniksor's mother is as
deaf as a post!

398
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,705
Exactly!

399
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:35,059
Guys, I forgot to introduce

400
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:37,300
A new pupil... Alexey Panteleev.

401
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:39,779
By the way, he is a future
writer, he writes poems.

402
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,588
Accept him properly.

403
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:51,543
We are all experts in poems!

404
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:53,668
We compose hymns!

405
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:57,380
Can you swallow the swords?

406
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,708
Maybe you can cycle?

407
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:05,387
We'll teach you. Goga,
it's a grammar-school boy!

408
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:11,659
They study here for nothing!

409
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:17,822
I have changed Vitya's piano

410
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:23,783
Who will cook him real pancakes?

411
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:28,263
Okay!

412
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:31,467
Who will feed him with real pancakes?

413
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:36,624
My little kitten! Blue-eyed!

414
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:44,702
Oh, Marta, if you only knew
what poems he wrote

415
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:49,181
when he was small!

416
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:54,868
My little blue-eyed kitten.

417
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:59,387
In short panties!

418
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:04,223
I smell the cabbage soup, which
is made of fresh cod-liver oil!

419
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:06,699
It's not our sealskin oil!

420
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:12,982
What are you doing?
It's a famine, do you see!

421
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:17,780
Vicniksor's mother is
blind as a mole!

422
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:48,386
Eat, Vitenka! My little
blue-eyed kitten. Eat!

423
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:51,064
Thank you, mother!

424
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:58,148
We've snatched it!

425
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:03,702
- Marta! Marta!
- She is here, she is here!

426
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:07,499
Ella Andreevna! Where are you?

427
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,785
You don't like it?

428
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:17,864
You have missed it, gawk!

429
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:21,984
Why you didn't steal a pancake?

430
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:25,182
Chase yourself...

431
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:34,384
What? Why do you
banish us? Hey?

432
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:37,905
Because it's mean... to rob
the blind old woman!

433
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:43,986
Meanness, meanness, meanness!
Go and denounce us to Vitenka!

434
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:48,382
; of SCID! An unprecedented event in our republic':

435
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:51,985
An angelic person has
appeared in our ranks!

436
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:53,423
Idiot!

437
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:58,061
What? Guys, does somebody
have a pancake?

438
00:43:58,150 --> 00:44:00,380
- A pancake!
- I have!

439
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,858
Eat! Eat!

440
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:08,181
- Grasp him!
- Grasp!

441
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:13,742
Eat! I say eat!

442
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:20,986
You hit my tongue! Beat him!!

443
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:38,345
- Beat him in the dark!!
- Vermin!

444
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:43,066
Bump him off!

445
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:13,381
Come with me.

446
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:36,387
- It's the end. He'll denounce us.
- Indeed!

447
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:39,385
We shouldn't have cramed
that pancake into his mouth.

448
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:44,059
Of course he will denounce!
It serves you right!

449
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:50,706
Panteleev is not like me.
He won't lick your boots.

450
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:58,380
Guys! A shocking incident
has happened in our school!

451
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:03,460
Old and weak woman was offended.

452
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:05,063
I didn't want to discuss this case

453
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:10,383
While it concerned myself
personally. But...

454
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:16,984
Later I witnessed more abominable

455
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:22,584
And aggressive incident.

456
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:32,779
Guys, I understand and
even share your indignation

457
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:35,782
About your classmate's act

458
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:39,947
But even if Panteleev acted
so basely

459
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:43,422
You didn't have the right to show your
resentment in such a barbaric way

460
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:49,585
And by Lynch law! You didn't have the right!

461
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:51,388
It means that Panteleev
didn't denounce us.

462
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:56,988
Panteleev! Lyosha!
Are you sleeping?

463
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:58,424
He's sleeping.

464
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:02,708
Go to hell! You don't let me sleep.

465
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:05,424
He isn't sleeping!

466
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:09,584
Are you hungry?
- He is!

467
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:20,062
Here we have collected something
to eat for you! Do you hear?

468
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:22,380
- We'll push it under the door!
- Come on!

469
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:25,223
Don't be angry, it was a mistake.

470
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:27,149
It's Greek to me...

471
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:09,018
- So, what is our school?
- A reformatory school!

472
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:10,304
A labour settlement!

473
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:13,382
Unhappy country, suffering from
the Chaldean's yoke!

474
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:15,461
SCID republic!

475
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:20,305
- Right you are! A republic!
- Rather monarchy, then the republic!

476
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:21,789
The Monarchy!

477
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:25,545
So, our school is a republic!

478
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:30,226
But Victor Nikolaevich, in republic
the power belongs to people!

479
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:35,859
- Ha! He'll give you a thrashing!
- Ionin is right! I agree.

480
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:41,628
I suggest to give people
the power in our school.

481
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:44,782
- That's splendid!
- I offer the self-government!

482
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:52,979
Don't beleive him!
Don't beleive him!

483
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:59,589
Now we elect the monitors! Of the
groups, dining-hall and cloakroom!

484
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:02,389
And who will be weighting the bread?

485
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:11,099
Don't warry, Ionin, the bread will be
distributed by SCID-citizen!

486
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:14,978
- That's right, Victor Nikolaevich!
- Well done, Vicniksor!

487
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:19,220
What a brainy man!
A brainy man!

488
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:23,019
The Council of the monitors
will settle all the questions.

489
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:29,219
You say "all the questions?"
Nuts to you!

490
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:33,262
- I will invite the monitors
to the Pedagogical meeting.

491
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:35,068
As the full members.

492
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:53,427
start the elections! The first post is the kitchen mo

493
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:55,580
- Who do you offer?
- Yankel! Chernikh!

494
00:49:55,710 --> 00:49:58,668
We'll do without blonds!
Without blonds!

495
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:02,789
- Cry for me!
- Let Gromonostsev be in the kitchen!

496
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:06,022
We'll do without horse-thiefs!
Without horse-thiefs!

497
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:07,862
Vote for Gypsy!

498
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:15,379
Guys, nevertheless, but we must
have a parliament, not a mob.

499
00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:24,386
I open the debate with selection of
candidates! Gromonostsev and Chernikh.

500
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:29,786
Hey, Gypsy, tell them
few words! Come on!

501
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:34,588
Gromonostsev!

502
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:45,585
SCID citizens! Dear voters!
I won't offend you, pals!

503
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:50,579
I'll give the crusts to the
senior company.

504
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:53,389
And I won't offend the
junior company, too!

505
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:04,983
The cod-liver oil must be on our tables!
The sealskin oil must be taken away!

506
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:07,180
A plenty of grub!

507
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:18,583
Panteleev!

508
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:22,059
Say, Panteleev!

509
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:26,388
Guys, we have the famine now.
We count each piece of bread.

510
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:28,984
In short, Gromonostsev
won't do here.

511
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:32,065
- We want the justice! - The honest
monitor must be in the kitchen!

512
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:34,789
Down with the horse-thief!
Down with the horse-thief!

513
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:37,782
In my opinion Yankel is the
justest guy! I mean Chernikh.

514
00:51:37,870 --> 00:51:40,384
Chernikh must be electee!
Yankel must be in the kitchen!

515
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:43,462
Down with the blonds! Down with the blonds!

516
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:46,989
Who votes for Gromonostsev?

517
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:49,385
Let your hands down.

518
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:53,788
Who votes for Chennikh?
A majority vote!

519
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:22,787
s conceived the idea of smoking? Does anybody wa

520
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:26,988
I warn:

521
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:31,985
I'll cancel both the vacations
and walks for discipline breakers.

522
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:35,900
The monitor of the cloakroom
will take their clothes off.

523
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:37,821
Oh, the great people of SCID!

524
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:40,868
You've been given the parliament,
but you've got the servitude!

525
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:44,386
I offer to choose Ionin as the
monitor of the cloakroom!

526
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:56,186
Long live the self-government!

527
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:59,421
Long live the President
of the democratic republic

528
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:01,466
Victor Nikolaevich Sorokin!

529
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:06,385
- Vivat to President! Vicniksor... hurray!
- Congratulations!

530
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:54,188
- Kapustin!
- I'm here!

531
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:56,101
- Nesterenkov!
- I'm here!

532
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:57,987
- Rodionov!
- I'm here!

533
00:53:58,630 --> 00:54:00,780
- Polunin!
- I'm here!

534
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:03,061
- Kuzmin!
- I'm here!

535
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:05,789
- Sloyonov
- Hey, newcomer!

536
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:07,145
- Yes! I'm here!

537
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:09,098
- Savin!
- I'm here!

538
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:10,862
Start to eat.

539
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:24,865
You have bad food here.

540
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:28,858
We eat only frozen potatoes.

541
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:32,388
That's bad.

542
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:38,548
Maybe you would like to eat pancakes,
cooked with the cod-liver oil?

543
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:41,867
- Eat up your bread quickly!
- I have no wish to eat.

544
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:45,227
- Are you replete?
- A kind of.

545
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:48,063
- Give us, we'll eat it together!
- Why together? I asked first!

546
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:49,629
And I was second!

547
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:51,663
Shame on you!

548
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:56,389
That's not good.

549
00:54:58,070 --> 00:55:02,268
I'll eat it myself.
On the lesson.

550
00:55:02,350 --> 00:55:06,468
Finish the breakfast.
Stand up!

551
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:08,224
Wait!

552
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:15,787
Here it is! Eat! You'll give it
back to me at lunch.

553
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:20,227
How do you like that! At lunch
they give us the quaters,

554
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:22,585
But you're foisting the eighth of it now!

555
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:30,384
- It's up to you. I don't force you.
- Wait! I agree!

556
00:55:39,070 --> 00:55:42,699
Thanks! Good boy.

557
00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:48,185
- Give me a bit!
- Where is yours?

558
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:52,467
- I owe the newcomer.
- What for?

559
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:54,786
Please, give me some.

560
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:57,784
Fancy that!

561
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:02,862
Lend till the supper.

562
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:07,099
Then you'll give me back 2 helpings!
At supper and at breakfast!

563
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:11,582
Lend me too!

564
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:14,059
- Then you'll give me back the
whole quarter. - All right.

565
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:15,549
Hey, newcomer, give me too!

566
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:17,063
- And for me too!
- And for me!

567
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:19,380
You will all give me back
the whole quarters!

568
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:21,786
Thank you.

569
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:25,624
Thank you.

570
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:33,219
You are so slender!

571
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:36,864
Thank you.

572
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:42,978
Thank you.

573
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:12,065
- Rokfeller! Swine!
- Rotshild!

574
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:14,459
Purishkevich!

575
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:27,825
What are you looking here?

576
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:29,502
It's not a junior company.

577
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:30,864
I thought...

578
00:57:31,830 --> 00:57:33,388
What did you think?

579
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:36,543
I thought you were hungry.

580
00:57:55,910 --> 00:57:58,219
- Here it is, guys!
- Do you have more?

581
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:01,263
Of course, I don't grudge it!

582
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:02,779
No more!

583
00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:05,185
- Oh! Give me!
- Leave him alone!

584
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:17,938
Ah! If we had some sugar
...and tea!

585
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:20,581
Help yourselves!

586
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:24,583
Wait a little! Hey, slaves!

587
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:26,899
Give, give!

588
00:58:26,990 --> 00:58:30,699
Eat! And bring the boiling
water! Be quick!

589
00:58:35,630 --> 00:58:37,063
What are you doing?

590
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:40,024
I'll smash his mug!

591
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:43,861
- Smash!
- It's impossible!

592
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:48,626
He eats three helpings every lunch!
I'm hardly able to drag my feet along.

593
00:58:49,590 --> 00:58:51,945
Eat these crumbs!

594
00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:58,060
Eat, guys! I don't grudge
anything for good friends!

595
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:03,582
If someone offends you... tell him!

596
00:59:05,870 --> 00:59:08,907
- I wish I had some tea now...
- And sugar.

597
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:10,986
Are you drinking tea?

598
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:15,386
Bon appetit!

599
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:18,986
Thanks!

600
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:22,781
I stored up some sugar for you.

601
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:24,983
Merci!

602
00:59:25,350 --> 00:59:28,581
You bribe the senior company!
You, skunk!

603
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:34,379
I'd whip you, rotten usurer!

604
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:38,543
- Let's fry him up!
- That's right! Open the oven!

605
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:39,983
Welcome!

606
00:59:40,270 --> 00:59:44,980
Oh, don't! Oh, don't!

607
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:51,226
You'll all kick the bucket from hunger!

608
00:59:52,110 --> 00:59:55,898
Hey, guys! They elect the new
monitors in dining-hall! Let's go!

609
00:59:55,990 --> 00:59:59,505
Konstantin Alexandrovich! May we
do some more exersises?

610
00:59:59,590 --> 01:00:02,388
All right! Repeat
the combination!

611
01:00:19,390 --> 01:00:20,789
Have a rest!

612
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:32,985
- Give me the key!
- I'll give you what for!

613
01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:37,385
- You are not the monitor anymore!
- And who is?

614
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:42,859
Savin... according to the majority
of the votes and the constitution.

615
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:47,987
Your time is expired! They
have elected the other one.

616
01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:27,988
Madam, you owe
me only 250 million.

617
01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:30,186
- Ah, blood-sucker!
- Merci!

618
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:32,383
- A notebook!

619
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:53,782
Here it is!

620
01:02:00,110 --> 01:02:03,341
Konstantin Alexandrovich! Has
Kosorov been in dining-hall today?

621
01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:04,988
No!

622
01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:07,581
But there is a note that
he has got his helping.

623
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:10,628
I told you that it was
something wrong in the kitchen.

624
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:12,348
- And has Pilnikov been there?
- No.

625
01:02:12,430 --> 01:02:14,227
- And Bessovestin?
- He is in a hospital.

626
01:02:15,790 --> 01:02:18,941
- And Starlinsky?
- He is at his parents.

627
01:02:19,550 --> 01:02:23,987
This is the result of your
self-government, Victor Nikolaevich.

628
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:33,460
Don't be naughty!

629
01:02:35,110 --> 01:02:37,180
This is awful!

630
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:42,946
The shabbiest act is

631
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:45,783
To steal the last slice

632
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:51,980
Of your friend's bread!

633
01:02:57,070 --> 01:03:00,949
- To leave the little ones hungry.
- It's vile and base.

634
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:07,386
Savin is dismissed!

635
01:03:10,670 --> 01:03:16,028
Victor Nikolaevich! Why?
I... I didn't want!

636
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:19,989
Who received the bread instead
of the absent pupils?

637
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:33,946
- Who did it?
I'll demand for

638
01:03:34,030 --> 01:03:36,464
The expulsion of Savin!

639
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:43,383
- But... where will I go?
- To cell for the time being!

640
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:46,303
Konstantin Alexandrovich!
Take him!

641
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:52,386
Let me go, I won't go to cell,
I won't, Chaldeans!

642
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:55,225
Who owes Sloyonov?
Raise your hands!

643
01:03:55,310 --> 01:03:59,940
- Me!
- Me!

644
01:04:00,030 --> 01:04:01,383
Everybody!

645
01:04:02,270 --> 01:04:05,865
- Do you all have your helpings?
- We do.

646
01:04:05,950 --> 01:04:07,781
- Eat!

647
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:16,787
- But he can call for elders!
- Never mind! Let him do that.

648
01:04:27,910 --> 01:04:36,181
"I guess life is a great delusion,

649
01:04:36,310 --> 01:04:40,508
But I don't complain, my
soul doesn't suffer

650
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:46,142
From the grief and wounds,
because nobody helps!"

651
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:53,065
- Pay the debt!
- Ask Fedor Mikhailovich.

652
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:56,501
- Who is Fedor Mikhailovich?

653
01:04:56,590 --> 01:04:58,387
Dostoevsky.

654
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:04,859
Here is the new rule: if we
owe you... you are fool!

655
01:05:10,430 --> 01:05:14,787
So, you are dishonest!
All right, wait a little!

656
01:05:15,670 --> 01:05:20,380
- What a mess will be now...
- What? Come what may!

657
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:37,783
It's he!

658
01:05:38,030 --> 01:05:39,861
I asked to pay the debt

659
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:42,987
But he sent me to Dostoevsky!

660
01:05:46,030 --> 01:05:50,308
But who do you think we are for you?

661
01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:53,223
Are we your body-guards? Hey!

662
01:05:53,310 --> 01:06:02,582
If you poke your nose one more time,
I'll give you a sock on the jaw!

663
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:08,188
Wait! Gypsy! Wait!

664
01:06:10,950 --> 01:06:12,668
Yankel!

665
01:06:15,590 --> 01:06:17,979
They put a yoke on yourself!

666
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:38,301
That's dishonest!
I didn't beat you!

667
01:06:38,790 --> 01:06:41,782
- Oh, it's painful!
- Beat this skunk!

668
01:06:41,870 --> 01:06:44,782
The slavery is abolished!

669
01:06:48,910 --> 01:06:52,789
Victor Nikolaevich!
Release Savin!

670
01:06:52,870 --> 01:06:54,861
It's impossible.

671
01:06:55,310 --> 01:07:00,304
Victor Nikolaevich,
come out for a minute!

672
01:07:17,350 --> 01:07:20,979
Victor Nikolaevich, we have
a self-government just now!

673
01:07:21,110 --> 01:07:22,463
- You really beleive us!
- I beleive you.

674
01:07:25,110 --> 01:07:27,260
Savin is not guilty.

675
01:07:34,430 --> 01:07:36,625
Is it you, Ptashlya?

676
01:07:38,270 --> 01:07:44,618
No! He wouldn't have hit!
It was me! Personally!

677
01:07:46,670 --> 01:07:48,945
- Where did they took you?
- In Crimea.

678
01:07:49,070 --> 01:07:51,061
- Have you been on resort?
- Yes.

679
01:07:53,550 --> 01:07:57,179
All our pupils have hobbies.
And what about you?

680
01:07:57,550 --> 01:08:00,428
The illustration of Chernikh.
- Yes, Chernikh. Are you an artist?

681
01:08:00,510 --> 01:08:02,785
- Nope.
- Oh, I see... you are a musician!

682
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:03,780
Nope!

683
01:08:03,950 --> 01:08:07,340
- Well, what about your
balalaika? - It's beautiful!

684
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:11,228
- Do you appreciate the beauty?
- Nope!

685
01:08:15,790 --> 01:08:17,587
Is it Dostoevsky?

686
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:23,500
It is Dostoevsky.
Did you read Dostoevsky?

687
01:08:23,590 --> 01:08:26,980
I read "Crime and punishment".

688
01:08:27,230 --> 01:08:30,779
And do you like reading? Nope?

689
01:08:30,870 --> 01:08:32,781
- Nope...
- Well.

690
01:08:34,070 --> 01:08:37,301
- But do you have a dream?
- A dream?

691
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:39,620
A dream.

692
01:08:43,070 --> 01:08:45,140
To eat my fill.

693
01:08:46,910 --> 01:08:50,380
Mother, make fresh
carrot tea for us.

694
01:08:52,030 --> 01:08:55,420
I understand you want to eat.
Well, would you like else?

695
01:08:57,030 --> 01:09:01,979
I'd like to snatch this table-cloth
and make a red shirt!

696
01:09:02,070 --> 01:09:04,504
- Cool?
Cool! Is that all?

697
01:09:07,190 --> 01:09:10,865
I want to escape from here!
That's my dream!

698
01:09:10,950 --> 01:09:15,262
It's fresh and hot! Drink,
kiddy, drink!

699
01:09:15,350 --> 01:09:17,386
Mother, thanks.

700
01:09:25,070 --> 01:09:26,947
Well, maybe I'll live
here for some days.

701
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:31,581
Come here, here is a place at the window!

702
01:09:47,070 --> 01:09:49,140
Sprechen sie Deutsch?
(Do you speak English?)

703
01:09:49,230 --> 01:09:52,108
- What?
- Do you speak German a little?

704
01:09:52,870 --> 01:09:55,987
- I speak very nice!
- Wow!

705
01:09:56,070 --> 01:09:59,779
- Gut. Sprechen sie.
- What?

706
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:01,463
Speak!

707
01:10:02,230 --> 01:10:06,462
In German... that's abracadabra,
in Russian it means the sandwich!

708
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:10,384
Is that all?

709
01:10:10,630 --> 01:10:17,149
Ofenbah, concern yourself with him.
Panteleev, go to the blackboard!

710
01:10:19,630 --> 01:10:21,621
Are you hungry?

711
01:10:23,630 --> 01:10:27,509
Oh, my mommy,
who is not hungry now?

712
01:10:28,670 --> 01:10:30,661
Hmm, mommy...

713
01:10:37,230 --> 01:10:39,380
I can't give you more
then one million.

714
01:10:39,630 --> 01:10:45,785
Are you crasy?
Eat! I say eat!

715
01:10:59,430 --> 01:11:03,389
- Who touches mommy... I'll kill him!
- Ha! Mommy!

716
01:11:03,470 --> 01:11:06,860
- But I wanted to call him Cyclop!
- A real Cyclop! Wow!

717
01:11:06,950 --> 01:11:08,986
You are a Cyclop!
I'll squash you!

718
01:11:09,070 --> 01:11:12,824
Look what a loony! Okay, you
are Mommy! As you like!

719
01:11:13,470 --> 01:11:16,462
- What is it?
- That's the hall door.

720
01:11:18,670 --> 01:11:20,581
Do you like the handle?

721
01:11:21,630 --> 01:11:26,784
- Nope! And what's that?
- A clock. Do you like it?

722
01:11:26,870 --> 01:11:28,383
Nope!

723
01:11:30,030 --> 01:11:32,385
- What's that?
- A mixer.

724
01:11:32,470 --> 01:11:36,782
- Do you like it?
- Nope!

725
01:11:40,030 --> 01:11:42,863
- Do you like it?
- I do!

726
01:11:59,830 --> 01:12:04,950
When they executed my
dad near Kakhovka,

727
01:12:05,110 --> 01:12:09,581
His American boots were
given to me, do you see?

728
01:12:11,270 --> 01:12:14,785
Hey! Mommy!

729
01:12:17,430 --> 01:12:19,944
Are you sleeping?

730
01:12:20,830 --> 01:12:22,388
He's sleeping.

731
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:23,785
Look out, Kostya Fedotov.

732
01:13:27,350 --> 01:13:30,979
Let me help you.

733
01:13:37,190 --> 01:13:40,182
Take care.

734
01:13:45,590 --> 01:13:48,980
You have stolen the last
trousers of your friends.

735
01:13:49,070 --> 01:13:52,346
The trousers were school property.
They can give the other pair.

736
01:13:52,630 --> 01:13:59,786
You say the"other!" They won't give
the other! There is no other pair!

737
01:14:00,230 --> 01:14:03,381
Soviet Government sewed these
trousers for the last money!

738
01:14:10,950 --> 01:14:13,180
Go away.

739
01:14:14,670 --> 01:14:16,388
Go away.

740
01:14:20,830 --> 01:14:23,185
And take it.

741
01:14:24,350 --> 01:14:25,385
Take.

742
01:14:26,510 --> 01:14:27,863
And give it back.

743
01:14:27,950 --> 01:14:31,704
Or else guys will know...
they will... you see.

744
01:14:31,790 --> 01:14:34,384
And go away. We don't
need such pupils.

745
01:14:53,430 --> 01:14:54,988
Kupets!

746
01:14:58,110 --> 01:14:59,589
Let me smoke!

747
01:15:03,510 --> 01:15:06,980
You've been cought by Vicniksor.

748
01:15:10,830 --> 01:15:15,381
You turned to be a scoundrel,
Kostya Fedotov.

749
01:15:19,230 --> 01:15:20,788
Kupets!

750
01:15:26,670 --> 01:15:30,788
May I come in?

751
01:15:31,630 --> 01:15:35,339
How will we celebrate this holiday

752
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:37,182
If we don't take
the solemn supper?

753
01:15:37,590 --> 01:15:40,184
- We'll dance till one drops!
- The performance!

754
01:15:40,270 --> 01:15:44,582
- What a performance, Jap?
- , Let's arrange the cabaret.

755
01:15:45,030 --> 01:15:49,945
Let's invite Poddubny!
We can also invite clowns!

756
01:15:50,030 --> 01:15:52,988
We can stage "War and peace"
with SCID's help.

757
01:15:53,110 --> 01:15:55,908
- And we can present "Three sisters"
- I will play sisters!

758
01:15:56,310 --> 01:15:57,868
And me!

759
01:15:58,750 --> 01:16:00,945
Classical literature is beautiful.

760
01:16:01,030 --> 01:16:05,387
But would you like to stage
anything modern? Revolutionary?

761
01:16:06,110 --> 01:16:09,500
For example, "The twelve"?

762
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:11,342
We can really take it.

763
01:16:11,430 --> 01:16:15,105
Great! Who wants to
take part in performance?

764
01:16:15,190 --> 01:16:16,987
I can dap-dance!

765
01:16:17,830 --> 01:16:19,786
I can move my ears!

766
01:16:20,350 --> 01:16:23,786
I know a song!
It's very plaintive!

767
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:56,619
- Bravo!
- Well done!

768
01:16:56,990 --> 01:16:58,981
A new singer appeared!

769
01:16:59,070 --> 01:17:02,858
Mommy won't do!
He can slip away.

770
01:17:04,710 --> 01:17:12,390
I want to be a singer! I dream of it!
I'll be damned if I escape!

771
01:17:13,110 --> 01:17:14,862
I'm not sure.

772
01:17:32,790 --> 01:17:34,985
Who's here?
Come here!

773
01:17:39,270 --> 01:17:40,589
What?

774
01:17:42,430 --> 01:17:45,069
You see, my mother feels bad.

775
01:17:45,230 --> 01:17:46,709
I see!

776
01:17:46,790 --> 01:17:49,463
Can you run to the drugstore
and buy an oxygen bag?

777
01:17:49,550 --> 01:17:51,029
- Yes, I can!
- Will you remember?

778
01:17:51,110 --> 01:17:52,304
Yes.

779
01:17:53,070 --> 01:17:55,186
Here is money and the prescription.

780
01:17:57,430 --> 01:17:59,307
- And the pass?

781
01:17:59,390 --> 01:18:00,618
Here.

782
01:18:05,710 --> 01:18:06,904
Okay.

783
01:18:07,110 --> 01:18:09,578
- Say the address!
- The address is on the prescription.

784
01:18:12,350 --> 01:18:15,899
Fedotov, wait! Stop!
You should put on the coat!

785
01:18:15,990 --> 01:18:17,309
We are a short of time!

786
01:18:17,830 --> 01:18:19,024
Wait!

787
01:18:26,230 --> 01:18:31,384
Keep balalaika! They gave 40
million for it on goods market!

788
01:18:33,870 --> 01:18:35,588
I'll be soon!

789
01:18:45,390 --> 01:18:46,743
Stop!

790
01:18:57,590 --> 01:19:04,428
Wow! Who do I see!
Ha! Kostya! Plaice!

791
01:19:04,510 --> 01:19:05,738
Boatswain!

792
01:19:05,830 --> 01:19:07,627
- Let's go!
- Splendid!

793
01:19:07,750 --> 01:19:09,980
- Let's warm ourselves!
Let's drink!

794
01:19:10,070 --> 01:19:13,221
Guys, I must go.
I'm late, guys!

795
01:19:13,310 --> 01:19:15,187
Let me go, do you hear me?

796
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:16,544
Come on, come on!

797
01:19:16,630 --> 01:19:18,985
Guys, I'm late! Let
me go, please!

798
01:19:19,070 --> 01:19:20,469
Here we are!

799
01:19:26,030 --> 01:19:29,784
Look what a dandy!
- He was going to his girlfriend!

800
01:19:30,030 --> 01:19:31,588
Give it back!

801
01:19:33,150 --> 01:19:35,266
What are you doing, scums?

802
01:19:35,350 --> 01:19:38,547
- Oh, hooligans!
- Give me that!

803
01:19:44,110 --> 01:19:48,422
Why! 2 million
and that is all!

804
01:19:48,510 --> 01:19:50,307
And what's this?

805
01:19:51,430 --> 01:19:54,467
She looks like nun.

806
01:19:56,030 --> 01:20:01,388
- For Vitya from his mom".
- Don't touch the picture!

807
01:20:03,550 --> 01:20:03,868
Let me go, they are
waiting for me!

808
01:20:12,830 --> 01:20:17,426
- Madams, give us some seeds!
- Pay money!

809
01:20:18,190 --> 01:20:20,146
Can we have it for nothing?

810
01:20:22,390 --> 01:20:24,267
She looked at me!
And then she smiled!

811
01:20:24,350 --> 01:20:27,023
- And what about you?
- Am I fool?

812
01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:29,988
I smiled her like a horse!

813
01:20:30,710 --> 01:20:31,984
Too early.

814
01:20:33,670 --> 01:20:34,785
Why?

815
01:20:36,030 --> 01:20:41,184
The less we care about a woman,
the easier to touch her heart.

816
01:20:44,390 --> 01:20:47,700
Maybe I should slick my hair down?
- No, it won't help.

817
01:20:51,190 --> 01:20:53,465
Close the window!

818
01:20:57,550 --> 01:20:58,949
Guys, I don't like it.

819
01:20:59,030 --> 01:21:01,180
Does it make any difference for you?
- Yes!

820
01:21:08,390 --> 01:21:09,584
Come here.

821
01:21:13,230 --> 01:21:17,746
Finally, bring your friends
here, to school.

822
01:21:17,830 --> 01:21:20,390
- We doubt you'll allow that!
- Why not?

823
01:21:20,910 --> 01:21:22,468
Well, swear on your mother!

824
01:21:25,470 --> 01:21:28,940
As a Presinent of SCID's
republic, I announce officially:

825
01:21:29,070 --> 01:21:32,460
You may come with your girlfriends
to our May-Day-holiday.

826
01:21:32,550 --> 01:21:33,778
AII!

827
01:21:34,230 --> 01:21:35,982
Hurray!

828
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:06,941
Hey, brunet, what do you want?
- I'm looking for Tonya! Markoni.

829
01:22:07,030 --> 01:22:10,625
Tonya! Tonya, a fop
has come to you!

830
01:22:10,710 --> 01:22:14,783
What? Why are you yelling?

831
01:22:21,350 --> 01:22:22,783
What do you want?

832
01:22:23,430 --> 01:22:26,866
Tonya, hi! Do you recognize me?

833
01:22:28,030 --> 01:22:30,180
Tonya, I didn't forget my vow.

834
01:22:30,430 --> 01:22:32,944
Let's go to our May-Day-holiday.

835
01:22:33,590 --> 01:22:36,980
And what about you, do you
remember your vow?

836
01:22:37,070 --> 01:22:39,379
- I don't.
- Why!

837
01:22:39,670 --> 01:22:40,500
You told me about your dad who
was the famous American inventor.

838
01:22:40,590 --> 01:22:47,621
Tonya! Tonya!
It's time to open the library!

839
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:50,509
Wait.

840
01:22:50,830 --> 01:22:55,984
Look here, you,
coachman of the 1 st guild!

841
01:22:56,550 --> 01:23:00,179
Good riddance to bad rubbish!

842
01:23:00,630 --> 01:23:04,782
- What? Why? For good?
- For good.

843
01:23:05,390 --> 01:23:08,143
- But what about the vow?
- You have recollected too late.

844
01:23:16,110 --> 01:23:17,623
Good bye.

845
01:23:26,150 --> 01:23:31,986
Tonya! Tonya! Do you hear?
It's time to open the library!

846
01:23:34,550 --> 01:23:38,145
You exchanged us for a woman!

847
01:23:41,150 --> 01:23:43,380
Long live the World's Revolution!

848
01:23:43,470 --> 01:23:45,347
Hurray!

849
01:23:54,830 --> 01:23:58,345
- A sister!
- How do you do!

850
01:23:58,630 --> 01:24:00,507
- How do you do!
- Come in, please!

851
01:24:07,030 --> 01:24:09,988
- A cousin!
- I'm very glad.

852
01:24:10,110 --> 01:24:12,066
A pretty madam.

853
01:24:12,790 --> 01:24:14,860
- A second cousin.
- How do you do!

854
01:24:14,950 --> 01:24:17,384
- How do you do! I'm Masha.
- Masha, come in, please!

855
01:24:20,870 --> 01:24:22,781
What a pretty girl!

856
01:24:22,910 --> 01:24:26,869
A glimpse of perfect womanhood!

857
01:24:27,990 --> 01:24:31,221
- Is she a second cousin?
- Yes.

858
01:24:31,310 --> 01:24:32,743
- She resembles you very much.

859
01:24:34,030 --> 01:24:35,179
- How do you do!

860
01:24:51,350 --> 01:24:52,624
What are they doing?

861
01:24:52,710 --> 01:24:55,986
They smash their mugs or
they distribute the food.

862
01:24:56,230 --> 01:24:59,586
Nope! They are dancing.

863
01:25:13,590 --> 01:25:16,787
Hey! Do you have a light?

864
01:25:18,870 --> 01:25:21,862
Mommy! Mommy!!

865
01:25:35,310 --> 01:25:38,302
Super dull drummer!

866
01:25:38,390 --> 01:25:40,585
Hey, bare-legged!

867
01:25:40,830 --> 01:25:43,424
Half-assed scouts!

868
01:25:43,510 --> 01:25:46,582
Hey, bare-legged, you'll
lose your tambourine!

869
01:25:48,910 --> 01:25:52,505
- What's up? Get down from
the window-sill immediately!

870
01:25:52,590 --> 01:25:55,980
Victor Nikolaevich, come here!
There are half-assed scouts!

871
01:25:58,990 --> 01:26:00,628
Stop that!

872
01:26:03,310 --> 01:26:05,778
These are not scouts!
These are the pioneers!

873
01:26:05,870 --> 01:26:08,304
- What pioneers?
- What are these pioneers for?

874
01:26:08,390 --> 01:26:10,426
Guys, the pioneers' community

875
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:14,783
Is recently established children's
communist organization.

876
01:26:14,870 --> 01:26:17,623
But why should we be
scapegoats? Let's organize it too!

877
01:26:17,710 --> 01:26:19,940
- Indeed!
- I'll play the pipe!

878
01:26:20,030 --> 01:26:22,385
I'll play the drum!

879
01:26:23,110 --> 01:26:27,183
Don't fly into a passion.
I'll make inquiries tomorrow.

880
01:26:42,590 --> 01:26:44,979
They stole the table-cloth.

881
01:26:45,350 --> 01:26:47,102
Teacher on duty!

882
01:26:53,070 --> 01:26:55,630
Yakushka, wait, he'll
make a tie for me!

883
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:56,620
Yes!

884
01:26:57,030 --> 01:27:00,545
Savushka, make a little
tie for me, please!

885
01:27:00,630 --> 01:27:06,102
mat's enough. You have cut all the table-cloth to piec

886
01:27:08,910 --> 01:27:10,138
Do you already have a supper?

887
01:27:19,870 --> 01:27:21,861
What's new,
Victor Nikolaevich?

888
01:27:24,110 --> 01:27:26,180
Guys, don't worry.

889
01:27:27,270 --> 01:27:29,386
Hurry up,
Victor Nikolaevich!

890
01:27:31,110 --> 01:27:34,386
They didn't permit us
to organise

891
01:27:37,030 --> 01:27:39,385
both pioneer and
comsomol community.

892
01:27:39,470 --> 01:27:41,586
- Why? -Why?

893
01:27:42,910 --> 01:27:46,186
Because our school is
a prison-kind school.

894
01:27:46,270 --> 01:27:48,784
But we don't make
a row anymore!

895
01:27:48,870 --> 01:27:53,864
It's forbidden till the complete
reform of the pupil.

896
01:27:53,990 --> 01:27:56,788
It's not provided in the
regulation, you see.

897
01:27:57,510 --> 01:28:00,308
- Then... our faces kept
us from it.

898
01:28:00,830 --> 01:28:01,785
Password!

899
01:28:01,870 --> 01:28:03,542
Your money will be ours!
Response!

900
01:28:03,630 --> 01:28:06,349
There's a nasty mouse
in every house! Go!

901
01:28:07,470 --> 01:28:08,380
Password!

902
01:28:08,470 --> 01:28:10,381
Your money will be ours!
Response!

903
01:28:10,470 --> 01:28:14,019
When I came nearer
I saw the light!

904
01:28:14,110 --> 01:28:16,670
We don't have the right to
organize the legal community

905
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:18,900
And so we organize the illegal one.

906
01:28:18,990 --> 01:28:20,059
Bandits!

907
01:28:20,150 --> 01:28:23,187
- Now, the vow! Who's first?
- Me!

908
01:28:26,670 --> 01:28:32,939
I swear to serve for our
common cause

909
01:28:33,310 --> 01:28:37,189
to the last drop of blood.
If I betray my organization

910
01:28:37,350 --> 01:28:40,262
may the public
contempt find me!

911
01:28:40,350 --> 01:28:43,786
And may my friends
condemn me.

912
01:28:43,870 --> 01:28:46,100
The disgrace may be
wiped out with the blood.

913
01:28:46,350 --> 01:28:47,419
Your hand!

914
01:28:49,270 --> 01:28:56,858
One, two, three, four.
The inevitable has occurred!

915
01:28:56,950 --> 01:28:58,269
I feel good!

916
01:28:58,350 --> 01:29:00,864
The inscription on
our flag must run:

917
01:29:00,950 --> 01:29:04,784
People's association, in which
the free evolution of each man...

918
01:29:04,870 --> 01:29:08,180
Is a condition of the free evolution of everyone!

919
01:29:08,430 --> 01:29:13,379
Karl Marks wrote this
in his manifesto.

920
01:29:13,830 --> 01:29:16,060
- Go to bed.
- But...

921
01:29:16,590 --> 01:29:17,989
Don't tell anybody!

922
01:29:19,390 --> 01:29:21,267
I don't understand anything.

923
01:29:37,510 --> 01:29:40,502
Jap! Why you don't bathe?

924
01:29:40,590 --> 01:29:43,662
Merci! But who will prepare?

925
01:29:43,750 --> 01:29:45,866
I have a secluded nook here.

926
01:29:45,950 --> 01:29:48,225
Today at 12 o'clock as usual
we have a lesson on the garret.

927
01:29:48,310 --> 01:29:52,383
Keep your eyes open!
Give the signal!

928
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:53,983
Yes!

929
01:29:54,110 --> 01:29:55,941
Right face!

930
01:29:57,030 --> 01:30:01,979
Follow me! Quick march!
One, two, three...

931
01:30:02,190 --> 01:30:05,421
Why you are sticking here?
Beat it!

932
01:30:06,630 --> 01:30:08,382
Are you deaf-and-dumb?

933
01:30:10,430 --> 01:30:15,458
- Guys! Pioneers beat our people!
- Pioneers beat Jap!

934
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:22,907
SCID, forward!!
Beat the bare-legged!

935
01:30:33,390 --> 01:30:36,188
Beat the bare-legged!

936
01:30:46,070 --> 01:30:50,302
Otekhnikin!
Otekhnikin!

937
01:30:51,430 --> 01:30:53,307
It's disgraceful!

938
01:31:01,910 --> 01:31:03,628
Are they yours?

939
01:31:04,790 --> 01:31:07,941
Mine.
Please, excuse me.

940
01:31:08,030 --> 01:31:11,659
How could they entrust
the orphan riff-raffs to this woman!

941
01:31:18,190 --> 01:31:19,782
Stand to line!

942
01:31:37,030 --> 01:31:39,590
A sin and a shame!

943
01:31:39,830 --> 01:31:42,788
You may be taken only
to the uninhabited island.

944
01:31:43,510 --> 01:31:48,140
Orphan rats! Scums!

945
01:31:48,990 --> 01:31:50,981
NAP-man! Blood-sucker!

946
01:31:55,390 --> 01:31:58,666
What a disgrace!
You disgrace me!

947
01:31:58,830 --> 01:32:01,583
We... we are not guilty!
The orphan kids...

948
01:32:01,670 --> 01:32:06,186
What orphan kids?
What old-regime words you are using?

949
01:32:06,270 --> 01:32:08,306
Okay - Dostoevsky's kids!

950
01:32:08,390 --> 01:32:12,224
Hey you! Red collars!
What are you doing here?

951
01:32:12,310 --> 01:32:14,949
Hey, feeble!
Play the pipe!

952
01:32:32,430 --> 01:32:37,185
- Sit here or I'll put out your eyes!
- It serves him right!

953
01:32:37,270 --> 01:32:39,340
Repeat! Say! Come on!

954
01:32:39,430 --> 01:32:43,025
I'm a turkey cock,
red sluggard in red collar!

955
01:32:43,110 --> 01:32:44,589
That's it! Repeat!

956
01:32:44,670 --> 01:32:48,788
Now, abjure your
red collar, scoundrel!

957
01:32:51,430 --> 01:32:54,581
It serves these pioneer
scums right!

958
01:32:59,390 --> 01:33:02,109
What are you doing, dregs?

959
01:33:02,190 --> 01:33:04,784
Who is this shrimp?

960
01:33:05,230 --> 01:33:08,506
I ask why do you
scoff at this boy?

961
01:33:08,590 --> 01:33:12,868
- Come here, sucker!
- Climb to the box for company!

962
01:33:18,990 --> 01:33:21,220
Well, I'll give you what's for!

963
01:33:25,030 --> 01:33:31,299
- You, single-eyed frog! You...
- Beat him! He must be pioneer, too!

964
01:33:31,710 --> 01:33:33,985
Get it, pioneer's defender!

965
01:33:34,070 --> 01:33:39,542
Oh my! Men, what are you doing?
You'll kill him! Oh!

966
01:33:39,950 --> 01:33:42,544
Homeless Konstantin Fedotov

967
01:33:42,630 --> 01:33:45,861
Wasn't scared of the
brutal drunk merchants,

968
01:33:46,270 --> 01:33:49,865
He defended the young pioneer

969
01:33:51,870 --> 01:33:54,384
And he didn't retreat,
until he lost consciousness.

970
01:33:54,990 --> 01:33:58,266
Pals, that's our Mommy!

971
01:35:06,270 --> 01:35:13,108
Thanks. Thank you! It's
the only picture of my mother.

972
01:35:13,830 --> 01:35:19,382
It's not my fault.
They didn't let me go. Boatswain.

973
01:35:19,790 --> 01:35:22,987
They took away your purse!
It's not my fault!

974
01:35:23,070 --> 01:35:29,020
Stop that! I know it's not your fault!
You'll tell that later.

975
01:35:42,270 --> 01:35:45,546
We say "hurray for Kostya Fedotov"
from all the pioneers!

976
01:35:45,630 --> 01:35:48,622
Hurray!

977
01:35:48,790 --> 01:35:55,787
- Mommy, make the speech!
- Hey, you'll lose your tambourine!

978
01:35:58,990 --> 01:36:05,020
Guys! Stop being awake in nights!
No more secrets!

979
01:36:05,110 --> 01:36:06,429
From this day

980
01:36:06,510 --> 01:36:10,423
Your organization of young
Communards becomes legal!

981
01:36:27,830 --> 01:36:28,979
Great!

982
01:36:31,670 --> 01:36:33,388
Did they really allow
to do that?

983
01:36:34,590 --> 01:36:36,865
No, they didn't.

984
01:36:37,830 --> 01:36:39,582
- It means...
- Right you are!

985
01:36:41,230 --> 01:36:43,380
Are you out of your mind?

986
01:36:48,310 --> 01:36:49,743
I'll do it!

987
01:36:49,830 --> 01:36:51,980
If I need... I'll go to
Felix Dzerzhinsky.
