1
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:43,499
Come on. Come on.
Hurry up. Hurry up.

2
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:45,510
Come on. Come on.
Hurry up.

3
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:13,770
<i>- How do you do, Mrs. Doray?
- How do you do, Judge Blake?</i>

4
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,070
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

5
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,441
What can I do for you?

6
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:23,278
Well, I have to read a paper
on the juvenile court at-

7
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:25,283
at the next meeting
of our women's club...

8
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:28,810
and I thought perhaps you would be kind enough
to give me the information that I need.

9
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:31,721
- I'll be glad to help you all I can.
- Thank you

10
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:34,726
Why don't you sit with me this morning
and watch what happens?

11
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:36,728
- Could I?
- I wish you would.

12
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:39,629
I like to encourage interest
in the juvenile court.

13
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:42,293
It's more important
than most people realize.

14
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,544
You see, I know all about
every boy before he faces me-

15
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,978
mentally, morally and physically.

16
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:06,318
George, if I were sittin' over there
and you were sittin' here...

17
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:08,383
what would you do
with a fella like yourself?

18
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:14,766
<i>- I'd like another chance.
- Sure you would That's what they all want.</i>

19
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:19,067
In the past, your chances
have all been your own way.

20
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,733
This time it's gonna be my way.

21
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:25,472
I'm gonna give you a chance
to work hard, to study, to make good.

22
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:30,675
I'm gonna commit you to the state school.

23
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:35,312
Stop crying-

24
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:38,517
You're not crying because
you're sorry for what you've done.

25
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:41,253
You're crying because
you're sorry for yourself.

26
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,261
Get the right slant on things.

27
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,494
Forget what's happened
and go up to the state school...

28
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:50,969
with the right attitude
and make good.

29
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,429
Hold up your head.

30
00:02:56,609 --> 00:03:00,102
And look the world
straight in the eye.

31
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,575
Will you do it?

32
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:06,642
Yes, sir.

33
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:13,459
Now this young lad
is above average mentality...

34
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,790
comes from honest,
hardworking people...

35
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,854
but for some reason
insists on running away.

36
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:25,235
Freddie, from the number of times
you've been running away lately...

37
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:28,240
it seems as if you want to be
a traveling salesman.

38
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,402
<i>Is that it?</i>

39
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:33,309
Seven times in one month.

40
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:38,743
That's a lot of times for one boy
to run away from home.

41
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:41,753
- What's the matter, don't you like your home?
- Yes, sir.

42
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:46,618
- Are you the boy's father?
- Yes, sir.

43
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:49,526
Just can't seem to keep this youngster
of yours at home, is that it?

44
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:54,363
Judge, I've done everything but tie him,
but it doesn't seem to do any good.

45
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:58,905
Freddie, you got me
wondering about you.

46
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,669
I like to find out about boys.

47
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,261
Do you want to tell me just why
you keep running away from home?

48
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,836
You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to, but I'd like to know.

49
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,211
I want to see my mother.

50
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:12,775
Why can't Freddie see his mother?

51
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:18,188
Well, Judge, I-I kind of
thought you knew about that.

52
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:46,516
It's pretty hard to explain to a boy
why he can't see his mother.

53
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:56,024
- Freddie, you know your mother's
been sick, don't you? - Yes, sir.

54
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,496
<i>Well, she's just been too
sick to have any visitors.</i>

55
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:01,397
That's why you haven't
been able to see her.

56
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:06,867
But if I promise you that just as soon as
she's well enough you can see her again...

57
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:09,237
will you promise me that you won't
run away from home anymore?

58
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,641
Yes, sir.

59
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:17,445
All right, now go on home with your father,
and remember your promise.

60
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,451
Yes, sir. And-

61
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,683
And you'll remember yours,
won't you?

62
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,896
<i>- Washington Lincoln Jackson.
- Yes, sir.</i>

63
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:33,898
<i>Have you ever been here before?</i>

64
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:37,960
No, sir. And I wouldn't be here now
'“lessin“' I was forced to come.

65
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:41,405
I suppose you know why
Officer Weems arrested you.

66
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:44,068
Yes, sir. Because
I was the smallest kid he could catch.

67
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:53,118
Well, you're charged with stealing
Simon Bittke's vegetable wagon.

68
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,553
Are you guilty or not guilty?

69
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:58,454
What else has you, judge?

70
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,585
Did you take the wagon
or didn't you?

71
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:05,325
Oh, the wagon.

72
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:08,493
Oh, you mean the wagon.

73
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:12,562
The wagon. Oh, yeah.

74
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:14,834
Is Mr. Bittke here?

75
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:19,003
No, Your Honor. His horse was sick today
and he had to take him to the doctor.

76
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,672
What were the circumstances
of the arrest, Officer?

77
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:28,551
Well, Judge, uh, Bittke come up to me
a-hollerin' and a-pointin'...

78
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:33,183
and I seen this kid here driving his wagon off
with a lot of the other boys, sol chased 'em.

79
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,193
<i>The, uh-</i>

80
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:38,856
<i>other kids got away,
and I arrested this one.</i>

81
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:42,697
Were you trying to steal
Mr. Bittke's vegetables, Washington?

82
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:46,763
Oh, no, sir. I just wanted to drive
a horse, that's all.

83
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:51,072
- Oh. So you just wanted to go for a ride?
- Yes, sir.

84
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,679
Washington, I'm gonna let you go...

85
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,978
but I want you to promise me never to
take anything that doesn't belong to you.

86
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,985
And I don't want to ever see you
in this courtroom again.

87
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:03,954
How come, judge?
You gonna quit?

88
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:10,452
<i>- Well, Sam, how you feeling?
- Just dandy, Judge. And you?</i>

89
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,726
Fine. Fine.

90
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:15,029
Don't know what to do with you.

91
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,365
- Your hometown won't take you back.
- Is that so?

92
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:21,396
- No. Neither your mother nor your
father want you. - They wouldn't.

93
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:26,378
I have to hold your case over for a week
and see what we can do.

94
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,471
You go back to juvenile hall, Sam.

95
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,676
Okay Judge-

96
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:38,757
That boy has a fine face.

97
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:41,658
He's one of the worst boys
I've ever handled.

98
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:46,563
He's a gang leader, a daring thief
and very, very tough.

99
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:50,933
If he isn't restrained, he may develop
into a dangerous criminal.

100
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:53,495
Well, he certainly doesn't look it.

101
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:57,441
We find that most juvenile delinquents
come from broken homes.

102
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,445
- You mean divorced people?
- Yes. Divorces. Separations.

103
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:03,346
Or many times where
one of the parents is dead...

104
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,510
and the other one
has to earn a living.

105
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:08,987
In that case, the child is
deprived of a normal home life.

106
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:11,990
Now, take this next case-

107
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:14,527
an orphan living with a poor family.

108
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:18,895
He hasn't got into any serious trouble yet,
but he may be headed for it.

109
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:21,798
- Arthur Simpson.
- Yes, sir.

110
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,635
- Art, looks like you're in trouble.
- Yes, sir.

111
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:28,640
<i>What about this boy, Officer?</i>

112
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:32,269
Well, Your Honor...

113
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:37,647
this Art Simpson has got the reputation
of being the worst boy in town.

114
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,651
<i>Never mind that.
Why'd you arrest him?</i>

115
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,711
Well, he took a car belonging
to Mrs. Ramsay for a joyride.

116
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:46,725
- How about it, Art? That right?
- No, sir.

117
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,726
But you did take the car,
didn't you?

118
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:52,162
No, sir. I just moved it
away from a fireplug.

119
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:56,168
<i>The car was found
four blocks away, Your Honor.</i>

120
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:58,499
<i>Seems to me you moved that
car quite a distance, Art.</i>

121
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:02,235
Well, it's kind of hard
to find a place to park these days.

122
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:06,939
The law says it's a crime to drive a car that
doesn't belong to you without permission.

123
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,038
- Did you know that?
- No, sir.

124
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:14,315
Well, remember the next time you see a car
parked by a fireplug. You can go now.

125
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,481
<i>Don't let me ever see you
in this courtroom again.</i>

126
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,524
<i>Case dismissed.</i>

127
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,583
<i>Court's adjourned for an hour.</i>

128
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:26,895
A few years ago, boys like that
were committed to institutions.

129
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,560
Few people realize
that in courts like this...

130
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:32,400
lies the solution to
our entire crime problem...

131
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:35,532
and that results are had through correction
and adjustment rather than punishment.

132
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:39,306
- That's wonderful.
- Young America.

133
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,473
<i>Boys from all walks of life.</i>

134
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:45,210
Young America at the crossroads.

135
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:48,310
All we can do is to try to set their feet
on the right road.

136
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:54,791
If you could pick one of these
boys at random-any one of them-

137
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,625
and follow him to his home
and observe his daily life...

138
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,961
you'd learn a great deal more
about this problem.

139
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,355
Where'd you get the car?

140
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:28,382
Oh, it was parked by a fireplug and I didn't
want the lady to get a ticket, sol moved it.

141
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,395
More darn fireplugs in this town.

142
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,397
Yeah. What you doing?

143
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,628
- Another invention?
- This here's a scientific experiment.

144
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,863
<i>Yeah, I guess so.</i>

145
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:41,066
Sure it is. I'm hypnotizing
these chickens.

146
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,666
Hypnotizing them?
Does it hurt 'em?

147
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:46,371
<i>- Nah.
- Will they stay like that?</i>

148
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:48,709
Sure, till I unhypnotize them.

149
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:51,148
- How do you do that?
- I ain't figured that out yet.

150
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:54,118
Wouldn't it be funny if you
could hypnotize people like that?

151
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:57,713
<i>- Boy, wouldn't we have fun.
- Yeah.</i>

152
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,724
Art!

153
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,124
- What are you doing with my chickens?
- I didn't do anything to them!

154
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,686
- I caught you dead to rights this time.
- I tell you I didn't do any-

155
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,426
I'm gonna take you
down to the police station right now!

156
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:11,700
Confound you, Art Simpson!
You're the worst boy in this town!

157
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:49,474
Thank you. Why, that was
a very brave thing for you to do.

158
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,567
You might have been hurt.

159
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:54,545
- You're-You're Arthur Simpson, aren't you?
- Yes, ma'am.

160
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:58,481
- What's the matter, Edie? - Well, this boy just
saved Sandy from being run over by a truck.

161
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,849
Oh, much obliged.

162
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,821
- Oh, that's all right, Mr. Doray.
- No more chocolate sodas.

163
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:07,519
Oh, Arthur!
Wait there a minute, please.

164
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,592
Jack, you need a boy here
at the store.

165
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:15,691
- Why not give the job to Arthur?
- Oh, now listen, Edie.

166
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:18,100
Oh, please. I-I know
he needs the work.

167
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:23,336
And besides, I have a particular reason
for wanting to help him.

168
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,344
Do you know that he's supposed to be
the worst kid in town?

169
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,177
- I don't believe it.
- Well, he's no rose geranium.

170
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,239
Oh, please Jack.
For me.

171
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:37,979
All right. But you're gonna find out
that I knew what I was talking about.

172
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:41,152
<i>Hey, come here.</i>

173
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:44,288
- Do you want a job?
- Yes, sir.

174
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:46,832
All right, be here tomorrow afternoon
right after school. Six bucks a week.

175
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,833
- Yes, sir.
- 3:30 at the latest.

176
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:52,064
Yes, sir.
Thanks, Mrs. Doray.

177
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:58,944
I give him the job,
and he thanks you.

178
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,755
Look at that old Clarence Paine.

179
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:17,091
- Every morning he walks to
school with Lily Schmidt. - Yeah.

180
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:22,329
- Always hanging around girls. Guys
like him make me sick. - Me too.

181
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:26,634
- Any guy that walks to school with a
girl is a big sissy. - I'll say so.

182
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:30,699
- Hmm. You don't see us walking with any girls.
- I should say not.

183
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:38,678
Of course, if, uh, two guys walk to school
with a girl it's different, ain't it?

184
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:43,417
I suppose so.

185
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:51,163
- Hello, cutie. Want me to carry your books?
- No, I don't.

186
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:56,225
Ah, come on. Don't be like that.
Nobody'll like ya.

187
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,664
Say, who is that fresh guy?

188
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,672
Why, that's Bull Butler.

189
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,937
He just got transferred here
from the southside.

190
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,944
I heard he licked every kid there.

191
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,947
I don't care who he is.
He's not gonna get fresh with Mabel.

192
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:14,316
So you're gonna red apple me, huh?

193
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:18,380
You let my apple alone,
you big old thing, you.

194
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:26,658
- Were you looking for me, Mabel?
- Yes, I was, Art.

195
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:29,099
I want you to walk
to school with me.

196
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,608
Hey, wait a minute.

197
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:39,337
Don't get funny, shrimp.

198
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:42,005
You want to make
something big out of it?

199
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:51,622
Well, well, well, well.
Tough guy.

200
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,318
Battling Kid Four-eyes.

201
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,361
Don't you call me four-eyes.

202
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:58,658
Ah.

203
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,257
Now what are you gonna see with?

204
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:05,327
Give me my glasses.

205
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:12,373
Four-eyes!

206
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,435
Hey, wait a minute!

207
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,782
I'm gonna tell you just one thing.

208
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,785
Nutty doesn't like to be
kidded about his weak eyes.

209
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:24,221
And if you do it again,
I'm gonna knock the stuff in' out of you.

210
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,224
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

211
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,226
No matter where we are
or what we're doing...

212
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:31,457
if you call him Four-eyes again,
I'm gonna poke you good.

213
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,295
- Why don't you start in now?
- All right.

214
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:39,034
<i>Well, come on.</i>

215
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,734
- I'll wait for you after school.
- Okay.

216
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:27,585
Four-eyes. Four-eyes.
Four-eyes.

217
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:32,386
<i>Four-eyes.
Four-eyes.</i>

218
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,517
Hey! You lay off of me, will ya?

219
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:36,687
<i>- I told you I'd do it!
- Artl Art!</i>

220
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:41,627
Arthur Simpson!
Arthur Simpson, how dare you!

221
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,634
I told him I'd do it, the big bully.

222
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:45,693
- I didn't do nothin', Teacher.
- You big liar.

223
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:49,332
That will do.
Come with me, Arthur.

224
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:52,639
- Don't forget about after school either.
- All right. That's enough now.

225
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:56,341
Now I'll appoint Clarence Paine
class monitor until I return.

226
00:16:56,415 --> 00:17:00,545
And mind you,
no noise and no talking.

227
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:03,654
Yes, Teacher.

228
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:04,689
Yes, Teacher.

229
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:10,690
Children, hush! I'll report
everyone that talks.

230
00:17:14,232 --> 00:17:18,760
Children, who did that?
Come, come. Who did it?

231
00:17:19,971 --> 00:17:22,133
You'll be suspended for this.

232
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:34,843
- Come on! Come on!
- Give it to him!

233
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,651
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!

234
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:52,636
- Come on, get up! Get up!
- Guess I beat him there, boy.

235
00:17:57,943 --> 00:18:00,469
- Get up. Art! Get up!
- Get up!

236
00:18:03,281 --> 00:18:07,047
Come on, get up!
Get up! Come on, get up!

237
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:14,681
Go on, you big bully.
Always fightin' somebody who's smaller.

238
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,697
Three, six, nine, the fight's mine.
I can lick you any old time.

239
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:22,632
- Oh, yeah?
- Ah, you big bully.

240
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:27,829
- That's a good fight.
- Good fight.

241
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:32,139
- Are you hurt, Art?
- No. That guy don't know how to fight.

242
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,613
Gee. I guess I'll have to
go to work now.

243
00:18:37,682 --> 00:18:40,379
- So long, Nutty.
- So long.

244
00:18:43,421 --> 00:18:45,355
- Hello, Mr. Doray.
- Where you goin'?

245
00:18:45,423 --> 00:18:47,653
You told me to come to work
after school, didn't ya?

246
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:50,559
Yeah, I told you to come after school.
That's half past 3:00, isn't it? Not 4:00.

247
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,155
All right, you don't have to come to
work now. You can go home.

248
00:18:53,231 --> 00:18:55,222
You're through before you start.

249
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:59,329
- I'm awful sorry.
- Are you? I'm not.

250
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:17,688
Oh, hello, Art.

251
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:19,747
- Hello, Mrs. Beamish.
- Come in.

252
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,126
Come-Why, what's the matter?

253
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:27,325
- Been fighting again?
- Yes, ma'am.

254
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:29,993
I got suspended
from school today too.

255
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:34,027
Oh, now that's a shame.
What happened?

256
00:19:34,105 --> 00:19:37,837
I'd rather Nutty-
I mean, Edward would tell you.

257
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:40,742
- Is he suspended too?
- No. just me.

258
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:45,750
Well, well. Never mind, Art.
It'll come out all right.

259
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:50,948
They got a lot to do putting you
out of school. The idea.

260
00:19:51,022 --> 00:19:52,956
Don't you worry.

261
00:19:53,024 --> 00:19:55,652
Gee. You're the only one
don't pick on me.

262
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:57,923
Everyone else thinks
I'm the worst kid in town.

263
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:00,624
Nonsense!
You're not bad at all.

264
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:06,263
There's a lot of mischief in you-
and deviltry too-but no real badness.

265
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:08,670
Wonder why a lot of people
always pick on kids?

266
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:14,179
- A lot of folks think that boys are
just small men, but... What are they?

267
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:17,045
Sometimes I think they're angels...

268
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:20,574
and sometimes I think they're devils.

269
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:24,486
- But whatever they are, I love 'em.
- Gee, you're swell, Mrs. Beamish.

270
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,355
So are you, Mr. Simpson.

271
00:20:27,425 --> 00:20:30,690
Why don't you call me Granny
like Edward does?

272
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:35,427
- Gee, can I?
- If you don't, you'll hurt my feelings.

273
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,594
All right, Granny.

274
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,867
- Hi.
- Hi.

275
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:44,875
- What are you making?
- Apple turnovers.

276
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:48,072
- Oh, boy. - And you'd better eat
your fill of them this time.

277
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:51,081
There won't be any more till
my next pension check comes.

278
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:53,811
Say, wait a minute.
I just got an idea.

279
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:57,981
Supposin' you put popcorn in the dough,
then you put them in the oven.

280
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:01,287
The heat pops the corn,
they turn over by themselves.

281
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:05,023
Now I've got an idea.

282
00:21:05,096 --> 00:21:07,758
Suppose you go out
and get me some wood in.

283
00:21:07,832 --> 00:21:10,392
Okay, Granny.
Practically done.

284
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:14,469
Did you tell her yet?

285
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:18,476
- I told her I was suspended, but you can
tell her why. - Why didn't you tell her?

286
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:22,275
Oh, sound like I was trying to
make a big guy of myself.

287
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:24,406
- Baloney.
- Hooey.

288
00:21:24,482 --> 00:21:28,419
- Well, thanks for stopping that
Bull Butler for me. - Oh, shut up.

289
00:21:28,486 --> 00:21:31,421
- You been home yet?
- Not yet.

290
00:21:31,489 --> 00:21:35,084
- She'll give you the dickens, I bet.
- I'm used to it now.

291
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:11,020
- What are you gonna do? - Guess I'd better
go home and get it over with. So long.

292
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:13,155
So long.

293
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:31,872
Oh, Mama, he's got my candy.

294
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:36,877
Let your sister alone.

295
00:22:38,289 --> 00:22:40,781
<i>Hurry up, Betty.</i>

296
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:51,069
Hello, Aunt Mary.
Is there something you want me to do?

297
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,798
Oh, there you are.

298
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:57,934
You never forget to come home
in time to eat, do you?

299
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:00,239
Running the streets all afternoon...

300
00:23:00,311 --> 00:23:03,440
when you could have been here
helping me with the wash.

301
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:09,215
No, there's nothing you can do now
except get out of my way.

302
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:12,917
Ma, he got put out of school today.

303
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:15,187
What's that?

304
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:19,788
- You did?
- Yessum. But I was gonna tell ya.

305
00:23:19,864 --> 00:23:23,164
More disgrace.
More trouble.

306
00:23:23,234 --> 00:23:26,693
You worthless,
good-for-nothing brat.

307
00:23:26,771 --> 00:23:29,263
If you weren't
my poor sister's kid...

308
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,274
you'd been out
in the streets long ago.

309
00:23:31,342 --> 00:23:34,334
- Please, Aunt Mary, let me tell you how-
- Tell nothing!

310
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:38,747
You got put out of school and I'm gonna
give you a lashing you'll never forget.

311
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:42,515
Come back here!
You'll get worse for running away!

312
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:03,030
Oh, dear. You’re just
too good for me.

313
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,372
I never can beat you at this game.

314
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:08,504
That makes an even
$10,000 you owe me.

315
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,448
- $10,000? - Well, you see, we usually
play for a hundred dollars a game...

316
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:16,579
but Granny was getting behind and she wanted
to get even, so we played for a thousand.

317
00:24:16,654 --> 00:24:22,252
Serves me right for being so extravagant.
Oh, 10:00. Bedtime.

318
00:24:24,395 --> 00:24:28,195
Art, after what happened
at your house tonight...

319
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:30,792
would you like to
stay here with Edward?

320
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:35,204
<i>If I go home, I'll get hit, and
if I don't... I'll get hit worse.</i>

321
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:38,208
<i>You stay here then.
I'll speak to your aunt in the morning.</i>

322
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:41,541
You will? Then I'll stay.
Thanks, Granny.

323
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:45,572
And I'll see that
school principal too.

324
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,119
- Oh.
- What-What's the matter?

325
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:50,382
<i>- Oh, nothing.
- I'll get your medicine.</i>

326
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:52,856
Just one of my spells.

327
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:58,295
It's empty.
Is there any more?

328
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:01,264
<i>- I'll run and get a doctor.
- Wait a minute, Art!</i>

329
00:25:01,332 --> 00:25:03,664
Granny don't like doctors.

330
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:07,296
- She's afraid she might have to go to the hospital.
- Why don't she go to a hospital?

331
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:10,398
Don't you know that in hospitals, if you're
poor, they slip you the black bottle?

332
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:12,409
- Black bottle?
- Sure.

333
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:16,072
- To put you out of the way and take the expense
off the county. - Gee, we gotta do something.

334
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:19,048
My-My medicine.

335
00:25:20,351 --> 00:25:22,877
It's all gone.
Got any money?

336
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:26,581
Come on.
We'll get some.

337
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:28,956
We'll be right back, Granny.

338
00:25:42,006 --> 00:25:44,976
- It's locked up, doggone it.
- Let's go to Doray's.

339
00:25:48,012 --> 00:25:49,946
Hey, what's the name
of that medicine?

340
00:25:50,014 --> 00:25:52,346
Dr. Watson's Famous Remedy.

341
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:03,119
- Gee, what are we gonna do now?
- I don't know.

342
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:06,687
Let's go to Doray's home and he can
open up the store and get it for us.

343
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:21,741
- He must be out.
- We gotta do somethin'.

344
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:24,145
We got to get that
medicine for Granny.

345
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:27,474
Come on.

346
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:47,969
- Say, this is steaiin', ain't it?
- I don't care.

347
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:51,270
But if we come around tomorrow and pay
Mr. Doray, it'll be all right, won't it?

348
00:26:51,342 --> 00:26:53,367
Sure.

349
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:01,445
- I'll come in and pull you in.
- Okay.

350
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,928
- Do you know where it is?
- I think so.

351
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,113
Here it is.

352
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,114
- How many did you get?
- I took two.

353
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:33,276
Well, come on.

354
00:27:39,023 --> 00:27:41,390
<i>Hmm.</i>

355
00:27:52,603 --> 00:27:55,368
Here it is.
Hurry up and take it, will you?

356
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:17,161
Well, well, well.
I caught you right in the act, eh?

357
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:21,290
I knew I'd get you sooner or later.
Say, who was that with you there?

358
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,892
Whose car is that out there?

359
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:26,130
You know what this is, don't you?

360
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:29,902
It's burglary
and stealing automobiles.

361
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:34,138
Now if you tell me who was with you,
I can make it a whole lot easier for ya.

362
00:28:35,546 --> 00:28:37,776
Oh, all right. Come along.

363
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:43,251
<i>Hey, Sarge-</i>

364
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:47,690
Say, I caught that Simpson kid breaking
into Doray's Drugstore.

365
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:51,923
Yeah. I'm gonna take him over to Doray's
for a minute before I bring him in.

366
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:54,158
Yeah. See you later.

367
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:13,942
- Hello, Officer. - I caught this lad
climbing out the back of your store.

368
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:17,318
He stole some stuff.
I don't know how much yet.

369
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:19,789
He copped a car too.

370
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:23,383
All right, come on in.

371
00:29:25,963 --> 00:29:28,898
Why, it's Art Simpson.
What's the matter?

372
00:29:28,966 --> 00:29:33,233
Why, your little pet
was caught breaking into the store.

373
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:37,639
- Art, is that true?
- Yes, ma'am.

374
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:39,938
Oh, Art, why did you do that?

375
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:42,878
I'll tell you why,
because he's a bad egg, that's why.

376
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,177
I tried to tell you that
and you wouldn't believe me.

377
00:29:45,249 --> 00:29:47,581
Now maybe you'll realize
that I was right.

378
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:50,893
All right, Weems, lock him up. I'll come
down in the morning and sign a complaint.

379
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,946
Wait a minute, please.

380
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:56,251
Don't you want to tell me
why you did it?

381
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:59,854
No, ma'am. I can't.

382
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:01,922
All right, Weems.

383
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:13,307
Jack, I'm surprised at you.

384
00:30:13,377 --> 00:30:16,005
Letting that boy be locked up
before you've even investigated.

385
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,947
They ought to lock up all the bad kids
in town. It'd be a better place to live in.

386
00:30:19,016 --> 00:30:20,780
- That's right, Edith.
- I think so too.

387
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:24,083
I don't think there's
such a thing as a bad boy.

388
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:27,181
It's simply a matter of
environment and-and opportunity.

389
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:29,488
<i>- Oh, Edie, you're an idealist.
- I should say you are.</i>

390
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,621
Do you know what kids like that
grow up to be? Murderers.

391
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:35,394
If people like us devoted more
time to community affairs...

392
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:39,926
- there wouldn't be as many so-called
bad children. - Got a match, Jack?

393
00:30:44,842 --> 00:30:47,709
I'm sorry to see you
here again, Arthur.

394
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:55,909
Put it there.

395
00:30:57,788 --> 00:30:59,779
Now we can talk.

396
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:07,060
- Who are the witnesses?
- Just me, Your Honor.

397
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:09,759
<i>- Who signed the complaint?
- Mr. Doray, Judge.</i>

398
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:13,134
<i>- Is he here?
- Oh, he'll be here any minute.</i>

399
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:16,496
<i>What'; the difficulty this time?</i>

400
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:19,566
Well, I was making my rounds
about 10:00."

401
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:22,477
when I come to Doray's Drugstore,
corner of Main and Second.

402
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:26,609
I saw a car with the motor running, sol thought
I'd take a look in the alley behind it...

403
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:28,675
you know, just for fun.

404
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:34,453
<i>Well, just as I got around in behind there,
I heard footsteps running.</i>

405
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:39,258
<i>Then I saw this lad here waving his hand
out of the window behind there.</i>

406
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:42,425
<i>He was handing out a bottle,
so I waited.</i>

407
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:47,495
And when he climbed out,
I nabbed him.

408
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:52,305
<i>- Had the window been forced?
- Yes, sir; it had.</i>

409
00:31:52,376 --> 00:31:55,311
And the car out front
belonged to Ed Wallace.

410
00:31:55,379 --> 00:31:58,974
And this kid here
told me he'd borrowed it.

411
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:04,078
Did you find the car
near a fireplug, Art?

412
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:09,649
<i>- What did you steal from the drugstore?
- I took some medicine.</i>

413
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:14,597
Medicine? That's funny. I never heard
of a boy stealing medicine before.

414
00:32:14,665 --> 00:32:18,533
They usually have to be bribed to take it.
What did you want with the medicine?

415
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,006
<i>There was someone else
with you in this, wasn't there?</i>

416
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:25,065
Son...

417
00:32:26,877 --> 00:32:30,211
I want to point out something
that I don't think you realize.

418
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:34,843
According to testimony, you've committed
burglary and theft of an automobile.

419
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:38,913
That's a very serious offense, one for
which we send men to the penitentiary.

420
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,755
It lies within my power...

421
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:45,160
to commit you to an institution during
the term of your minority.

422
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:49,634
- How old are you?
- Thirteen.

423
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:53,898
That would be eight years then.
Eight long years.

424
00:32:53,971 --> 00:32:56,906
Now I don't want to do that.
I want to help you.

425
00:32:56,974 --> 00:32:58,999
But I can't do that unless
you're frank with me...

426
00:32:59,076 --> 00:33:01,511
and tell me all the hows
and whys of this whole thing.

427
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:03,513
Who was with you?

428
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:06,061
Judge, I did break in the drugstore
and I took some medicine...

429
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:08,108
but that's all I can tell ya.

430
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:14,457
I'm sorry to be late, Judge...

431
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:17,153
but I was taking inventory at the store,
and I have to get right back.

432
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:19,754
If you want me to testify,
let's get it over with in a hurry.

433
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:23,232
Uh, Doray, john A. The truth, the whole
truth, nothing but the truth, so help me God.

434
00:33:25,302 --> 00:33:28,135
Evidently, you haven't had
any experience in courtrooms, Mr. Doray.

435
00:33:28,205 --> 00:33:30,765
No, sir, I haven't. As far as I'm
concerned it's a waste of time.

436
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:33,368
I'm a very busy man. Now just what was it
you wanted to ask me?

437
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:37,540
I want to ask you with as much emphasis
as the dignity of the bench will permit...

438
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:39,811
<i>- to take a seat or leave this room.
- What?</i>

439
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:44,048
You've been guilty of contempt.
Ordinarily you'd be fined.

440
00:33:44,121 --> 00:33:47,386
But the court realizes that a man of your
temperament and ignorance of court procedure...

441
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:49,449
may not be responsible
for what he says.

442
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,859
<i>So I simply ask you
to take a seat or leave the room.</i>

443
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:53,920
All right, sir,
if that's what you want.

444
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:58,663
But frankly, with as-with as much emphasis as
the dignity of my temperament will permit...

445
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:00,727
I never got such a raw deal
in my life.

446
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:04,264
- Officer, arrest that man.
- For what? I'm not the burglar.

447
00:34:04,341 --> 00:34:07,242
You're in contempt of court,
and I fine you $10.

448
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:18,745
Thank you very much.

449
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:23,116
All right, there's your 1 O bucks.

450
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:25,424
This is only the juvenile court,
but it's dignity must be maintained.

451
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:27,021
It's all right with me.
Maintain it.

452
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:31,160
I impose an additional fine
of$25 upon you, Mr. Doray.

453
00:34:44,281 --> 00:34:48,514
- Looks like the county's too poor to
pay the judge’s salary. - What's that?

454
00:35:00,397 --> 00:35:03,059
All right, Art. I want to know just
who was with you...

455
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:06,536
- the night you broke into the drugstore.
- It was me.

456
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:11,641
Well, these two kids are pals,
Your Honor.

457
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:13,700
<i>He must be the one
I heard running away.</i>

458
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,678
Come on up here, lad.

459
00:35:28,424 --> 00:35:32,088
- What's your name?
- Nutty-I mean, Edward Beamish.

460
00:35:32,161 --> 00:35:35,131
- Do you know Arthur here?
- Yes, sir.

461
00:35:35,198 --> 00:35:37,997
- Pretty well?
- Pretty.

462
00:35:38,067 --> 00:35:40,536
Were you with him the night
the drugstore was broken into?

463
00:35:40,603 --> 00:35:42,731
Yes, sir.

464
00:35:42,805 --> 00:35:45,297
<i>Did you hear Arthur's
testimony just now?</i>

465
00:35:45,374 --> 00:35:47,399
No, sir.
I just now sneaked in.

466
00:35:47,477 --> 00:35:49,969
<i>Just now sneaked in? Why?</i>

467
00:35:50,046 --> 00:35:52,606
Well, I didn't want Art
to get all the blame for this.

468
00:35:52,682 --> 00:35:58,086
I see. Well, now, you tell me
just what happened.

469
00:35:59,088 --> 00:36:01,079
Well...

470
00:36:01,157 --> 00:36:03,751
Art and me adjust moved
the car from a fireplug...

471
00:36:03,826 --> 00:36:07,524
and we took a shortcut
through the alley by the drugstore.

472
00:36:07,597 --> 00:36:10,294
And I saw the back window was open.

473
00:36:10,366 --> 00:36:14,462
Sol said to Art, “I think
we ought to close that window...

474
00:36:14,537 --> 00:36:19,532
because if it's left open, someone might
climb in and rob Mr. Doray's store. “

475
00:36:21,344 --> 00:36:24,314
Sol climbed up and tried to
reach in for the catch...

476
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,644
but I overbalanced myself
and fell in the store.

477
00:36:28,951 --> 00:36:32,683
Well, when Art saw me fall in...

478
00:36:32,755 --> 00:36:35,816
he climbed up
and tried to help me out.

479
00:36:35,892 --> 00:36:38,156
He held my hand, but...

480
00:36:38,227 --> 00:36:41,458
I slipped and pulled him in too.

481
00:36:43,466 --> 00:36:47,061
I see. Well, now you're
both in, then what?

482
00:36:47,136 --> 00:36:51,471
Well, I managed to get out first.

483
00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:54,476
<i>- I heard someone coming, I ducked.
- Why?</i>

484
00:36:54,544 --> 00:36:57,445
<i>Well, I didn't want anybody to think
f was robbing the drugstore.</i>

485
00:36:57,513 --> 00:36:59,447
Certainly not.

486
00:36:59,515 --> 00:37:01,813
Well, why didn't you come forward before
and tell your story?

487
00:37:01,884 --> 00:37:05,252
- Didn't you know your pal was in trouble?
- Yes, sir.

488
00:37:05,321 --> 00:37:07,483
<i>Well?</i>

489
00:37:07,557 --> 00:37:09,753
I guess I was scared to.

490
00:37:11,994 --> 00:37:14,861
<i>- Is that your story, Edward?
- Yes, sir.</i>

491
00:37:18,901 --> 00:37:23,498
You fell into the drugstore
and Art fell in trying to pull you out.

492
00:37:26,576 --> 00:37:29,011
- Is that it?
- Yes, sir.

493
00:37:30,713 --> 00:37:34,479
Well, then, how do you account for
the bottle of medicine that was stolen?

494
00:37:39,221 --> 00:37:42,987
<i>- '(our Honor?
- Are you concerned in this case, madam?</i>

495
00:37:43,059 --> 00:37:46,393
Yes, indeed I am.
I'm his grandmother.

496
00:37:46,462 --> 00:37:49,523
<i>- Do you wish to testify as a witness?
- Yes, I do.</i>

497
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,761
<i>Kindly raise your right hand.
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth...</i>

498
00:37:51,834 --> 00:37:53,859
<i>the whole truth, nothing but the truth,
so help you God?</i>

499
00:37:53,936 --> 00:37:57,634
- ! do. - Now then, Mrs.
Beamish, what do you know about this?

500
00:37:57,707 --> 00:38:02,702
I know this much, that these two boys
wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me.

501
00:38:02,778 --> 00:38:04,906
How's that?

502
00:38:04,981 --> 00:38:08,144
Because I had one of my spells.

503
00:38:08,217 --> 00:38:11,915
And there was no medicine in the house
and no money to buy it.

504
00:38:11,988 --> 00:38:14,013
And they went and got it for me.

505
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:18,027
And I think it's a shame to punish them
for doing a good deed.

506
00:38:18,094 --> 00:38:21,860
And I'll pay Mr. Doray for it
out of my next pension check.

507
00:38:21,931 --> 00:38:25,333
Oh, so the boys took the medicine
for you because you were sick?

508
00:38:25,401 --> 00:38:27,369
That's it exactly.

509
00:38:27,436 --> 00:38:31,896
I've used Dr. Watson's Famous Remedy
for years. Mr. Doray knows that.

510
00:38:31,974 --> 00:38:34,272
<i>I buy it from him all the time.</i>

511
00:38:34,343 --> 00:38:36,744
Didn't you see my picture
in the paper?

512
00:38:36,812 --> 00:38:39,372
No.

513
00:38:39,448 --> 00:38:43,407
I wrote a testimonial
and they printed my picture with it.

514
00:38:43,486 --> 00:38:46,080
Well, thank you
very much, Mrs. Beamish.

515
00:38:46,155 --> 00:38:48,988
Will you just
sit over there, please?

516
00:38:52,128 --> 00:38:55,063
Well, Mr. Doray,
Mrs. Beamish's testimony...

517
00:38:55,131 --> 00:38:57,293
puts a different aspect
on the burglary, doesn't it?

518
00:38:57,366 --> 00:39:00,131
<i>How do you feel about it now?</i>

519
00:39:02,405 --> 00:39:04,965
Well, I'll tell you.

520
00:39:05,041 --> 00:39:09,000
If I'm in contempt this time,
you'll have to take a check.

521
00:39:09,078 --> 00:39:12,878
I'm a businessman
and a property owner, Your Honor.

522
00:39:12,948 --> 00:39:15,679
Now if every time anybody happens
to need a bottle of medicine...

523
00:39:15,751 --> 00:39:17,685
they can break
into a drugstore and take it...

524
00:39:17,753 --> 00:39:21,485
well, then, of course, my property isn't
safe, is it, nor is any other merchant's.

525
00:39:22,925 --> 00:39:24,916
<i>I think these two boys
ought to be punished.</i>

526
00:39:24,994 --> 00:39:29,659
Because as I understand it, and I know
that you'll correct me if I'm wrong...

527
00:39:29,732 --> 00:39:33,396
the courts were instituted
for the protection of property.

528
00:39:45,147 --> 00:39:49,482
I'll issue an order committing
these two boys to the state school.

529
00:39:53,489 --> 00:39:56,424
<i>- Your Honor?
- Yes, Mrs. Beamish?</i>

530
00:39:56,492 --> 00:40:00,929
- Can I say just a word?
- Certainly.

531
00:40:00,996 --> 00:40:03,829
Please don't send my Edward away.

532
00:40:03,899 --> 00:40:05,833
Please, Judge.

533
00:40:05,901 --> 00:40:08,029
He's not a bad boy.

534
00:40:08,104 --> 00:40:10,766
Why, he's the best boy around the house
you ever saw.

535
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,774
He helps me with the housework...

536
00:40:12,842 --> 00:40:15,436
and I never have to speak
twice to him.

537
00:40:15,511 --> 00:40:18,640
And-And he works after school...

538
00:40:18,714 --> 00:40:21,649
and gives me every penny he makes.

539
00:40:21,717 --> 00:40:26,985
And, judge, he's so smart.
He's always inventing things.

540
00:40:27,056 --> 00:40:29,650
Oh, he's got a good mind.

541
00:40:29,725 --> 00:40:33,992
<i>And he always says his prayers...</i>

542
00:40:34,063 --> 00:40:36,789
<i>before I tuck him in at night.</i>

543
00:40:36,899 --> 00:40:39,596
And it wouldn't be right.

544
00:40:39,668 --> 00:40:44,196
Why, he's all I live for.

545
00:40:44,273 --> 00:40:47,709
He hasn't anybody but me.

546
00:40:47,777 --> 00:40:50,439
His mother put him in my arms...

547
00:40:50,513 --> 00:40:54,643
when she lay dying, and made me
promise I'd look out for him.

548
00:40:54,717 --> 00:40:57,743
And I have.
I've done the best I know.

549
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:01,222
<i>I've gone without things myself'...</i>

550
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:04,590
<i>so that he wouldn't
ever be cold or hungry.</i>

551
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:09,120
Oh, judge, please.

552
00:41:09,198 --> 00:41:11,394
Please.

553
00:41:11,467 --> 00:41:15,199
Don't send my boy away from me.

554
00:41:15,271 --> 00:41:17,205
Please!

555
00:41:33,823 --> 00:41:35,814
As I said before...

556
00:41:35,891 --> 00:41:40,328
I'll issue an order committing these
two boys to the state school.

557
00:41:40,396 --> 00:41:43,422
But I'll stay execution
of the order indefinitely.

558
00:41:45,334 --> 00:41:48,895
<i>This means that if you're ever brought
before me again for any reason whatever...</i>

559
00:41:48,971 --> 00:41:51,406
<i>the commitment order will go
immediately into effect.</i>

560
00:41:51,473 --> 00:41:53,464
<i>- You understand that?
- Yes, sir.</i>

561
00:41:53,542 --> 00:41:56,739
There's one other condition
to your probation...

562
00:41:56,812 --> 00:41:59,179
a condition which I always
impose where two or more boys...

563
00:41:59,248 --> 00:42:02,775
are accomplices
in a matter of this kind.

564
00:42:02,852 --> 00:42:05,150
That is this:

565
00:42:05,221 --> 00:42:09,249
You're not to see, speak or travel
together at any time in the future.

566
00:42:09,325 --> 00:42:14,092
<i>H' you do, I'll consider it a violation
of your probation.</i>

567
00:42:14,163 --> 00:42:18,066
<i>This may seem harsh, but it's the only
effective prevention I've found...</i>

568
00:42:18,133 --> 00:42:20,727
<i>for something like this
happening again.</i>

569
00:42:20,803 --> 00:42:25,832
Mrs. Beamish, I'll release your grandson
in your custody on probation.

570
00:42:25,908 --> 00:42:28,343
<i>You'll be responsible
to this court for him.</i>

571
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:32,040
<i>All right, Edward.
You may go.</i>

572
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:42,589
Art, I want to release you
on the same conditions.

573
00:42:44,693 --> 00:42:46,684
Mrs. Mary Taylor?

574
00:42:48,797 --> 00:42:53,860
<i>- Y es, sh. - You're this boy's aunt,
also his guardian, I understand.</i>

575
00:42:53,936 --> 00:42:55,870
Yes, sir.

576
00:42:55,938 --> 00:42:59,602
I want to release him in your custody. Will
you be responsible to this court for him?

577
00:42:59,675 --> 00:43:02,701
No, sir, I will not.

578
00:43:02,778 --> 00:43:06,737
I've kept him and fed him
and given him a mother's care.

579
00:43:06,815 --> 00:43:09,147
I got my own to think about.

580
00:43:10,352 --> 00:43:13,117
He's no good, Your Honor.

581
00:43:13,188 --> 00:43:16,351
<i>He's makin' hoodlums
outta my kids...</i>

582
00:43:16,425 --> 00:43:19,087
<i>and I don't want him
in my house anymore.</i>

583
00:43:20,229 --> 00:43:23,255
Maybe the reform school
can make a man of him.

584
00:43:23,332 --> 00:43:25,323
I can't.

585
00:43:32,074 --> 00:43:35,203
<i>Well, Art, I don't know
what to do with you.</i>

586
00:43:36,211 --> 00:43:38,737
Has the boy any other relatives?

587
00:43:38,814 --> 00:43:41,044
No, sir.

588
00:43:42,384 --> 00:43:44,682
Hmm, that complicates things.

589
00:43:46,822 --> 00:43:50,554
Well, you're a ward of this court, Art,
and I gotta do something with you.

590
00:43:51,627 --> 00:43:54,119
There are two courses open to me.

591
00:43:54,196 --> 00:43:58,656
I can find some responsible person
who's willing to act as your guardian...

592
00:43:58,734 --> 00:44:03,194
or I can turn you over to a state institution
and let the state take care of you.

593
00:44:07,676 --> 00:44:10,008
I guess you'll have to...

594
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,070
send me away, Judge.

595
00:44:15,317 --> 00:44:18,184
<i>- Your Honor?
- Yes, Mrs. Doray?</i>

596
00:44:18,253 --> 00:44:21,052
I will act as the boy's guardian.

597
00:44:21,123 --> 00:44:24,423
Edie, have you lost your mind?
Have you gone cr-

598
00:44:24,493 --> 00:44:27,428
Why, she doesn't mean that,
judge. She's gone crazy. She's-

599
00:44:27,496 --> 00:44:30,261
I'll adjourn this hearing
to my chambers.

600
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,501
Well, I-Well, you-
Uh-Hey, now listen, Judge.

601
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:38,370
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Fun is fun, but you can't-

602
00:44:41,543 --> 00:44:45,707
Now, then, Mrs. Doray, are you quite sure
you want to assume this responsibility?

603
00:44:45,781 --> 00:44:47,943
- Yes, I'm sure.
- You'll do nothing of the sort!

604
00:44:48,017 --> 00:44:50,611
I absolutely forbid it!

605
00:44:50,686 --> 00:44:54,179
<i>Do you think it's wise in view
of your husbands attitude?</i>

606
00:44:54,256 --> 00:44:57,123
Oh, I think I can change that.

607
00:44:57,192 --> 00:44:59,820
<i>It's a very fine thing
your wife is doing, Mr. Doray.</i>

608
00:44:59,895 --> 00:45:02,364
A year in a nice home
with the right inﬂuences...

609
00:45:02,431 --> 00:45:04,627
would make all the difference
in this boy's life.

610
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,998
His life? Yeah, that's great.
What about my life?

611
00:45:07,069 --> 00:45:10,972
Please, Jack.
This is something I want to do.

612
00:45:12,708 --> 00:45:16,667
Your Honor, I'm of legal age
and a property owner.

613
00:45:16,745 --> 00:45:20,238
<i>- Does that qualify me?
- Yes, it does, Mrs. Doray.</i>

614
00:45:20,315 --> 00:45:24,809
<i>Of course, there are a few necessary
formalities, but that can be easily arranged.</i>

615
00:45:24,887 --> 00:45:30,053
Well, Art, looks as if you're
going to belong to me for a while.

616
00:45:30,125 --> 00:45:33,095
Gee, I don't know
what to say, Mrs. Doray.

617
00:45:33,162 --> 00:45:35,324
But if you take me, I'll do my best.

618
00:45:35,397 --> 00:45:37,559
- Mm-hmm.
- Honest, I will.

619
00:45:37,633 --> 00:45:39,567
Edie-

620
00:45:52,047 --> 00:45:54,675
- What'd the judge do with the boy, jack?
- What'd he do with him?

621
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:57,378
He gave him to me!

622
00:46:06,628 --> 00:46:08,858
- Morning, Mrs. Doray.
- Good morning.

623
00:46:08,931 --> 00:46:11,366
Can this be the same boy I brought home
with me yesterday?

624
00:46:11,433 --> 00:46:13,492
- Yes, ma'am.
- Why, I can hardly believe it.

625
00:46:13,569 --> 00:46:15,560
Turn around.

626
00:46:15,637 --> 00:46:18,038
- Swell, huh?
- Swell!

627
00:46:18,107 --> 00:46:21,509
Look, jack.
Doesn't Art look nice?

628
00:46:21,577 --> 00:46:23,511
Beautiful.

629
00:46:40,162 --> 00:46:42,153
I'm sorry.

630
00:46:43,899 --> 00:46:47,529
Never dig your spoon
into a grapefruit.

631
00:46:47,603 --> 00:46:49,594
Do it this way.

632
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:10,657
Oh, time for school.

633
00:47:10,726 --> 00:47:13,957
The judge has had you reinstated
and you're going back to your old class.

634
00:47:14,029 --> 00:47:16,361
- Yes, ma'am.
- Good-bye, dear.

635
00:47:19,334 --> 00:47:22,895
- I don't have to tell you to be a good boy, do I?
- No, ma'am.

636
00:47:22,971 --> 00:47:25,167
Good-bye, Mr. Doray.

637
00:47:35,651 --> 00:47:40,384
Jack, if I hadn't been married to you long
enough to know you, I'd say you were a mean man.

638
00:47:40,455 --> 00:47:43,823
I don't care what you say.
I'm sore, and I'm going to stay sore.

639
00:47:43,892 --> 00:47:45,917
You brought that kid
into our home against my wishes...

640
00:47:45,994 --> 00:47:47,985
and don't think
you're gonna make me like it.

641
00:47:48,063 --> 00:47:50,794
Oh, please Jack.
Don't be so stubborn.

642
00:47:50,866 --> 00:47:54,632
I want to give Arthur a chance in life,
and I want you to help me.

643
00:47:54,703 --> 00:47:57,798
Never. I don't like the kid,
and I don't want him here.

644
00:47:57,873 --> 00:48:00,399
All the talkin the world
isn't gonna change me.

645
00:48:01,543 --> 00:48:04,706
- Jack, I'm ashamed of you.
- I've had my say.

646
00:48:13,088 --> 00:48:15,250
I gotta go to work.

647
00:48:16,258 --> 00:48:18,192
Bye.

648
00:48:27,035 --> 00:48:30,096
Hi, Art.
Gee, I'm glad to see ya.

649
00:48:31,106 --> 00:48:33,097
Boy, you look swell.

650
00:48:33,175 --> 00:48:35,166
Better than I ever saw ya.

651
00:48:35,244 --> 00:48:37,474
That's some suit, all right.

652
00:48:40,182 --> 00:48:45,518
I was just sayin' to my granny,
“I hope I see Art on the way to school. “

653
00:48:45,587 --> 00:48:48,784
And she said,
remember what the judge told me.

654
00:48:48,857 --> 00:48:50,951
I'm not allowed to speak to you.

655
00:48:51,026 --> 00:48:56,226
But, shucks, no judge
can bust us up, can they?

656
00:48:56,298 --> 00:48:58,232
Huh?

657
00:49:02,938 --> 00:49:06,203
Gee, Art, aren't ya gonna
say anything to me?

658
00:49:06,275 --> 00:49:09,176
Ain't you even gonna say hello?

659
00:49:16,018 --> 00:49:18,453
I know the judge said we shouldn't.

660
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:22,218
And I know you wanna
make good for Mrs. Doray.

661
00:49:22,291 --> 00:49:26,751
But, gosh, you could
at least say hello to a fella.

662
00:49:29,431 --> 00:49:32,492
Hmm, you're scared.

663
00:49:32,567 --> 00:49:36,197
Afraid of the old judge.
Afraid to do anything, you big sissy.

664
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:42,870
You got a lot of nice new clothes now,
and you're stuck-up about it.

665
00:49:45,347 --> 00:49:48,578
What do I care?

666
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:51,347
I don't care if you
don't speak to me.

667
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:54,390
I don't care if I never see you again.

668
00:50:21,683 --> 00:50:24,744
- Edie, we can't go.
- Why not?

669
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:28,120
- Why, it's the maid's night out, isn't it?
- Well, what of it?

670
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:31,160
What of-Say, you don't mean to
tell me you'd go away...

671
00:50:31,226 --> 00:50:35,595
- and leave that kid here all alone, do ya?
- Why, of course I do.

672
00:50:35,664 --> 00:50:38,531
You'd come back and find the house
burned down or the silverware gone.

673
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:43,094
- Now, you mark my words.
- Jack, I think you’re being very unfair.

674
00:50:43,171 --> 00:50:46,630
Now, you'll have to admit he's been here
a week, and he's been as good as gold.

675
00:50:46,708 --> 00:50:49,803
Yeah, that's just it.
He's been too good. it's not natural.

676
00:50:49,878 --> 00:50:53,576
You just hate to give in, don't you?

677
00:50:53,648 --> 00:50:56,982
You know, in your heart I think
you really like him as much as I do.

678
00:50:57,052 --> 00:50:59,043
Say, not me.

679
00:51:03,024 --> 00:51:05,584
We are going to leave you
in charge of the house.

680
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:07,822
- You won't go out, will you?
- No, ma'am.

681
00:51:07,896 --> 00:51:10,331
- Not for anything?
- No, ma'am.

682
00:51:10,399 --> 00:51:12,800
I want to show you
that I really trust you.

683
00:51:12,868 --> 00:51:15,428
- You won't let me down?
- You can bet on that.

684
00:51:15,504 --> 00:51:17,438
<i>Hmm.</i>

685
00:51:20,175 --> 00:51:22,644
Ready, dear?

686
00:51:22,711 --> 00:51:25,908
- You're gonna leave him here, huh?
- Well, of course.

687
00:51:26,915 --> 00:51:28,906
All right.

688
00:51:28,984 --> 00:51:31,078
Just wait and see, that's all.

689
00:52:00,782 --> 00:52:04,980
Oh, hello, Granny. Come on in.
Gee, I'm awful glad to see ya.

690
00:52:06,087 --> 00:52:09,819
Have a seat.
Mr. and Mrs. Doray just left.

691
00:52:12,394 --> 00:52:14,590
What is it?
Is there something the matter?

692
00:52:14,663 --> 00:52:17,291
It's Edward.

693
00:52:17,365 --> 00:52:19,857
- What's the matter with him?
- He's sick.

694
00:52:19,935 --> 00:52:22,165
He's awful sick.

695
00:52:22,237 --> 00:52:25,867
He caught cold last week,
and it got worse and worse.

696
00:52:25,941 --> 00:52:30,139
I made him go to bed.
I've done everything I can for him, but-

697
00:52:30,212 --> 00:52:32,544
Oh, he's so sick.

698
00:52:32,614 --> 00:52:36,551
And all day long, he keeps asking me
to get you to come and see him.

699
00:52:36,618 --> 00:52:40,145
He just begged me to get you.

700
00:52:40,222 --> 00:52:42,884
Run over, will you?
Just for a minute?

701
00:52:42,958 --> 00:52:44,949
Why, sure.

702
00:52:46,595 --> 00:52:48,996
I can't.
Not right now.

703
00:52:49,064 --> 00:52:51,931
I have to wait till
Mrs. Doray comes home.

704
00:52:53,001 --> 00:52:56,460
Art, he's awful sick.

705
00:52:56,538 --> 00:52:58,870
I wouldn't have come after you
if he wasn't...

706
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:01,272
on account of what
the judge said and all.

707
00:53:01,343 --> 00:53:04,608
But... he keeps on calling for you.

708
00:53:04,679 --> 00:53:07,614
Oh, I think you ought to go.

709
00:53:07,682 --> 00:53:09,878
Have you got a doctor?

710
00:53:09,951 --> 00:53:11,942
Well, you have to have one.

711
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:15,479
- How about medicine?
- I haven't any money.

712
00:53:26,801 --> 00:53:30,533
Here, take this and get a doctor, any
doctor, and anything else you need too.

713
00:53:43,552 --> 00:53:46,886
What are you tryin' to do,
make a fella think you’re sick?

714
00:53:46,955 --> 00:53:51,620
Hello, Art.
Gee, I'm glad you came over.

715
00:53:51,693 --> 00:53:55,596
I was afraid you were sore at me
for what happened the other day.

716
00:53:55,664 --> 00:53:58,964
- You ain't, are ya?
- No, I'm not sore. Course not.

717
00:53:59,034 --> 00:54:01,628
That's good.

718
00:54:01,703 --> 00:54:05,139
You're about the only
real friend I ever had...

719
00:54:05,206 --> 00:54:08,767
and I wouldn't want you
to be mad at me.

720
00:54:08,843 --> 00:54:11,073
I don't know why I did it.

721
00:54:11,146 --> 00:54:14,411
I guess maybe I was jealous.

722
00:54:14,482 --> 00:54:16,644
You had nice clothes and everything.

723
00:54:16,718 --> 00:54:18,948
Want me to do anything?

724
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:21,182
Want me to get you a drink of water?

725
00:54:21,256 --> 00:54:23,190
No.

726
00:54:25,527 --> 00:54:27,689
Just sit here by me.

727
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:36,401
Hey, Art, remember
the time we put the frogs...

728
00:54:36,471 --> 00:54:38,633
in the music teacher's desk?

729
00:54:38,707 --> 00:54:41,369
Yeah. Boy, how she jumped.

730
00:54:41,443 --> 00:54:44,413
Remember when we went fishin'
and fell in with our clothes on?

731
00:54:46,581 --> 00:54:52,213
We used to have a lot of fun,
didn't we?

732
00:54:52,287 --> 00:54:56,952
Sure, we did. We're gonna have
a lot more together too.

733
00:54:57,025 --> 00:54:59,426
Why, hurry up and get well.

734
00:55:01,663 --> 00:55:04,325
- Do you mean it?
- You bet I mean it.

735
00:55:04,399 --> 00:55:08,529
I don't care about the judge
or old juvenile court or anything.

736
00:55:08,603 --> 00:55:11,800
We're gonna be pals
just like we used to be.

737
00:55:11,873 --> 00:55:16,504
That's great. That's what
I wanted you to say.

738
00:55:16,578 --> 00:55:18,740
No judge or nobody...

739
00:55:18,813 --> 00:55:21,544
gonna stop us from being together...

740
00:55:21,616 --> 00:55:23,550
always.

741
00:55:24,953 --> 00:55:28,753
You remember
that airplane I invented?

742
00:55:29,758 --> 00:55:32,090
It ﬂies, all right.

743
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,959
Me and you ﬂy in it...

744
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:37,021
way, high UP-

745
00:55:38,299 --> 00:55:41,360
Way up in the clouds...

746
00:55:42,604 --> 00:55:45,073
<i>up by the stars.</i>

747
00:55:46,075 --> 00:55:48,510
<i>Floating along.</i>

748
00:55:48,577 --> 00:55:50,568
Just ﬂoating.

749
00:55:51,914 --> 00:55:53,848
Clouds.

750
00:56:02,224 --> 00:56:06,127
Gee, it's...
gettin' dark in here.

751
00:56:08,597 --> 00:56:10,588
Awful dark.

752
00:56:15,971 --> 00:56:18,963
Where's Granny?

753
00:56:19,041 --> 00:56:21,066
I want my granny!

754
00:56:31,854 --> 00:56:34,915
Nutty? Nutty-

755
00:56:36,492 --> 00:56:38,426
<i>Nutty!</i>

756
00:56:38,494 --> 00:56:41,589
Nutty, wake up.
Wake up, Nutty.

757
00:56:41,663 --> 00:56:43,927
Nutty! Please wake up.

758
00:56:43,999 --> 00:56:46,627
Wake up, Nutty, please!

759
00:56:46,702 --> 00:56:48,670
<i>Nutty! Nutty!</i>

760
00:56:50,973 --> 00:56:52,964
<i>Granny.</i>

761
00:56:54,676 --> 00:56:57,304
He went to sleep,
and I can't wake him up.

762
00:57:27,042 --> 00:57:29,067
Oh, Art?

763
00:57:30,279 --> 00:57:33,044
Guess Art's gone to bed.
I'll go up and see.

764
00:57:33,115 --> 00:57:35,709
Yeah, too bad he couldn't
turn out a few lights.

765
00:57:35,784 --> 00:57:39,049
Probably all tired out,
poor little fellow. Overworked.

766
00:57:52,067 --> 00:57:54,900
- Why, he's not in his room.
- Why, of course he's not in his room.

767
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:59,339
And he's not in the house!
He's gone, and your money's gone with him.

768
00:57:59,408 --> 00:58:03,402
- Oh, I can't believe it. - You can't? Better
check around the house. See what's missing.

769
00:58:03,479 --> 00:58:06,608
- Don't be so unfair.
- The kid was just waiting for a chance like this.

770
00:58:06,682 --> 00:58:09,117
This was a cinch to happen.
I tried to tell you that.

771
00:58:09,184 --> 00:58:12,916
- I won't believe he's guilty till he's had a
chance to explain! - If you weren't so stubborn-

772
00:58:16,758 --> 00:58:21,161
Well, as far as I'm concerned, this is the finish.
You're gonna send that kid back to the judge.

773
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:25,133
I'll do nothing of the sort
until he tells me what's happened.

774
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:35,508
This is what comes of bringing
riffraff into a decent home.

775
00:58:35,577 --> 00:58:39,741
- I knew this was gonna happen, Edie. I kept
telling you! - Yes, you've been telling me!

776
00:58:39,815 --> 00:58:43,115
<i>All you've done is to make it
as difficult as you could.</i>

777
00:58:43,185 --> 00:58:47,747
I can't figure this out. The boy leaves
your home when you tell him not to go.

778
00:58:47,823 --> 00:58:50,155
He steals your money
and still you stick up for him.

779
00:58:50,225 --> 00:58:53,456
<i>- Oh, Edie, you're a fool.
- Don't you dare talk to me that way!</i>

780
00:59:01,937 --> 00:59:07,535
All right, Edie. I'll just say
one thing more, and then I'll shut up.

781
00:59:07,609 --> 00:59:11,341
You know, I wish I could like that kid.
Honest, I do, for your sake.

782
00:59:11,413 --> 00:59:14,439
But I can't.
There's no use.

783
00:59:14,516 --> 00:59:17,417
And you know that before
that kid came into our house...

784
00:59:17,486 --> 00:59:20,820
we were a pretty
happily married couple, weren't we?

785
00:59:20,889 --> 00:59:25,292
And ever since he's been here, we've done
nothing but quarrel and fight and have trouble.

786
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:28,227
I mean, there's no use
kiddin' ourselves.

787
00:59:28,297 --> 00:59:31,096
We can't go on like this.

788
00:59:31,166 --> 00:59:34,534
Either that kid's got to go
or I do, Edie-one of us.

789
00:59:34,603 --> 00:59:36,594
Really, I mean that.

790
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:42,538
And as much as I love you, Edie, I'll go-
even if it means a divorce.

791
00:59:59,394 --> 01:00:01,385
All right.

792
01:00:04,032 --> 01:00:06,296
Lack.

793
01:00:12,641 --> 01:00:17,135
Art! Art, I thought
I told you not to leave the house...

794
01:00:17,212 --> 01:00:19,203
not for anything.

795
01:00:19,281 --> 01:00:21,750
- Why did you?
- Let me alone, will ya?

796
01:00:23,585 --> 01:00:27,021
I'm sick and tired of everyone
telling me what to do.

797
01:00:28,557 --> 01:00:32,050
I went out because
I wanted to, that's why.

798
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:35,654
And I took your money too.
What're you gonna do about it?

799
01:00:35,731 --> 01:00:38,223
<i>I never asked to come and live here.</i>

800
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:41,531
I don't wanna stay no more.
I'm no good, and I never will be any good!

801
01:00:41,603 --> 01:00:45,267
I'm bad! I'm the worst kid in town, that's
what I am! Now, how do you like that?

802
01:00:59,988 --> 01:01:02,719
Never mind, dear. You tried hard
and you did the best you could.

803
01:01:02,791 --> 01:01:06,227
But even you couldn't do anything
with a kid like that. Let him go.

804
01:01:07,663 --> 01:01:11,156
<i>- And I wanted to help him.
- I feel awfully sorry for you.</i>

805
01:01:11,233 --> 01:01:15,864
<i>Really I do. But I'm glad it turned out
this way for both our sakes.</i>

806
01:01:15,937 --> 01:01:17,871
<i>Hmm.</i>

807
01:01:21,143 --> 01:01:23,635
Come on now.
Forget about it, will ya?

808
01:01:46,334 --> 01:01:50,202
Well, I just phoned the authorities
and told them to pick that kid up.

809
01:01:50,272 --> 01:01:54,402
- What's the matter?
- Little Nutty Beamish died last night.

810
01:01:54,476 --> 01:01:57,070
He did?
Aw, that's too bad.

811
01:01:57,145 --> 01:02:00,137
And Art was with him when he died.

812
01:02:00,215 --> 01:02:02,877
Art was?
How do you know?

813
01:02:02,951 --> 01:02:05,886
The postman just told me.

814
01:02:05,954 --> 01:02:10,516
That must've been why
he left the house-to go to his pal.

815
01:02:10,592 --> 01:02:13,152
Hmm. Poor boy.

816
01:02:14,329 --> 01:02:16,821
Gee, I wish he had told us that.

817
01:02:16,898 --> 01:02:21,199
He heard us quarreling about him,
and he knew he stood between us.

818
01:02:21,269 --> 01:02:26,230
Hmm! And he wanted to make me think
that he was unworthy.

819
01:02:26,308 --> 01:02:28,402
I'm sorry, Edie.
Honestly I am.

820
01:02:28,477 --> 01:02:31,469
Jack, surely this will change
your attitude about him.

821
01:02:31,546 --> 01:02:34,572
<i>- Go and find him, will you, and bring
him back? -You bet I'll find him.</i>

822
01:02:34,649 --> 01:02:37,448
Don't you worry about it.
I'll find him.

823
01:02:39,054 --> 01:02:41,216
Gosh, don't you think I'm human?

824
01:03:02,077 --> 01:03:04,478
Say, I'm awful sorry
to hear about Nutty.

825
01:03:04,546 --> 01:03:09,985
Say, you haven't seen anything
of Art Simpson, have ya?

826
01:03:11,853 --> 01:03:16,450
Well, I got orders to pick him up
and turn him back to the juvenile court.

827
01:03:16,525 --> 01:03:19,551
I thought maybe
he might be around here.

828
01:03:20,562 --> 01:03:23,122
Well, he isn't.

829
01:03:25,567 --> 01:03:27,558
Well, I, eh-

830
01:03:38,547 --> 01:03:40,538
Has he gone?

831
01:03:50,225 --> 01:03:54,355
Gee, I thought I could stay here
and help you like Nutty did...

832
01:03:54,429 --> 01:03:57,421
but I guess they won't let me.

833
01:03:57,499 --> 01:04:00,867
The best thing for me to do
is get out of the old town.

834
01:04:00,936 --> 01:04:04,065
Yes. I suppose so.

835
01:04:06,741 --> 01:04:11,178
But don't you worry.
I'll go someplace else and get a job.

836
01:04:11,246 --> 01:04:13,305
When I do, I'll send for ya...

837
01:04:13,381 --> 01:04:15,679
and we'll live together.

838
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:17,980
That'll be fine, Art.

839
01:04:32,167 --> 01:04:36,536
- Hello, Mabel.
- I brought Edward's school books.

840
01:04:36,605 --> 01:04:41,304
<i>- I thought you might want them.
- Thank you, dear.</i>

841
01:04:41,376 --> 01:04:45,609
- Ain't there something I could do?
- No, dear, thank you.

842
01:06:02,590 --> 01:06:05,491
- We'd better take him with us.
- Yeah.

843
01:06:06,494 --> 01:06:08,428
Hey, wait a minute!

844
01:06:08,496 --> 01:06:10,658
- How long have you been here?
- Only a few minutes.

845
01:06:10,732 --> 01:06:13,565
- Come on. We're going for a ride.
- I don't wanna go for no ride!

846
01:06:13,635 --> 01:06:15,967
Sure you do!
We'll drop you off someplace.

847
01:06:26,648 --> 01:06:29,140
What's the matter, Mr. Doray?
Well, what happened?

848
01:06:29,217 --> 01:06:32,187
I've been held up. A couple of fellas
came in here in slugged me.

849
01:06:32,253 --> 01:06:35,848
- I'll bet them's the two fellas I
just saw drive away from here. - Yeah?

850
01:06:35,924 --> 01:06:38,791
My car's outside.
Come on, Weems!

851
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:44,221
Straight ahead, Mr. Doray!

852
01:07:04,519 --> 01:07:06,681
There's a car behind us!

853
01:07:14,396 --> 01:07:17,855
- Come on! Step on it!
- I've got it wide open!

854
01:07:21,336 --> 01:07:23,998
That's the car!

855
01:07:26,541 --> 01:07:29,010
That's them, all right.

856
01:07:29,077 --> 01:07:31,671
He's gettin' closer!

857
01:07:35,583 --> 01:07:40,817
It's that druggist we slugged.
He's got a copper with him.

858
01:07:40,889 --> 01:07:43,551
Yes? Then plug 'em!

859
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:46,550
Gimme your gat.

860
01:07:51,232 --> 01:07:53,860
I'm gonna get him.

861
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:28,032
What-What are you doin' here?

862
01:08:28,103 --> 01:08:30,902
They tried to shoot ya...

863
01:08:30,972 --> 01:08:33,134
so I wrecked the car.

864
01:08:37,178 --> 01:08:39,545
Thanks, Art.

865
01:08:39,614 --> 01:08:41,946
I don't know what
to say to you, kid.

866
01:08:42,016 --> 01:08:45,077
I guess you think I'm a pretty mean
sort of a guy, don't you...

867
01:08:45,153 --> 01:08:47,918
the way I've treated
you and everything, and-

868
01:08:47,989 --> 01:08:50,515
Honest, I don't know what-

869
01:08:50,592 --> 01:08:53,926
But I will make it up to you, Art.
Honest, I will.

870
01:08:53,995 --> 01:08:56,157
I'm sorry.

871
01:08:56,231 --> 01:08:58,700
<i>So, he's mixed up in it too, eh?</i>

872
01:08:58,766 --> 01:09:01,565
Yeah, and it's a good thing
for us that he was.

873
01:09:17,018 --> 01:09:20,955
“And as a result, Mr. Doray
is planning to adopt Art Simpson. “

874
01:09:21,022 --> 01:09:23,957
- How's that, Art?
- Swell.

875
01:09:31,299 --> 01:09:33,290
I'm sorry.

876
01:09:34,736 --> 01:09:36,727
Okay, pal.
