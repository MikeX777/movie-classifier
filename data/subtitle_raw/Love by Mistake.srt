00:01:06,007 --> 00:01:07,645
LOVE BY MISTAKE

2
00:01:26,607 --> 00:01:27,278
Good morning.

3
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:28,563
Good morning.

4
00:01:45,247 --> 00:01:47,363
Could I get your autograph?

5
00:01:52,727 --> 00:01:53,318
Oh, yes.

6
00:01:56,207 --> 00:01:56,798
Elizabeth.

7
00:01:59,847 --> 00:02:01,917
A PLACE UNDER THE SUN.

8
00:02:02,727 --> 00:02:05,560
After writing a book like this
you can die, can't you?

9
00:02:05,847 --> 00:02:07,678
- Have a good day.
- Thanks.

10
00:02:12,807 --> 00:02:13,796
Julio!

11
00:02:17,607 --> 00:02:18,881
Munuñi!

12
00:02:24,647 --> 00:02:26,046
Let me look at you.

13
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:27,966
You put on weight.

14
00:02:29,047 --> 00:02:29,957
Where's Milly?

15
00:02:30,887 --> 00:02:33,606
They should declare
a World No-Salsa Day.

16
00:02:33,767 --> 00:02:36,520
I don't even notice it.
It's Like the heat.

17
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:41,640
Milly could’ve left her thesis
for ten minutes.

18
00:02:41,847 --> 00:02:43,724
She knows I Like her meeting me.

19
00:02:43,887 --> 00:02:47,197
Poor dear. She and Judith
are working Like mad.

20
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:50,877
She wanted to, but they're
in a race against time.

21
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:55,920
This heat!

22
00:02:56,247 --> 00:02:59,284
The heat in this country
works overtime.

23
00:02:59,447 --> 00:03:01,677
It never takes a day off.

24
00:03:10,927 --> 00:03:12,883
No! Turn that shit off!

25
00:03:15,807 --> 00:03:16,478
Just keeps getting bigger.

26
00:03:17,407 --> 00:03:19,875
Well, you've been away
for two months.

27
00:03:20,687 --> 00:03:23,155
A man's hand is what's needed.

28
00:03:27,047 --> 00:03:28,685
I'm glad you noticed.

29
00:03:28,847 --> 00:03:33,398
I spoke to a builder,
but I was waiting for you.

30
00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:38,443
It's nice to be missed.

31
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:41,003
All right.

32
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:42,885
I think what I brought
will cover it.

33
00:03:44,287 --> 00:03:47,120
We have to check the ceiling.
It's falling apart.

34
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:49,444
Two windows have rotten wood,

35
00:03:49,607 --> 00:03:53,395
the kitchen needs painting
and the car still has that noise.

36
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:54,761
Hey!

37
00:03:56,127 --> 00:03:58,766
It can all wait until
my next novel comes out.

38
00:03:58,927 --> 00:03:59,962
When will that be?

39
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:10,084
You dyed your hair.

40
00:04:11,007 --> 00:04:13,726
Fifty-nine minutes and a half!

41
00:04:14,127 --> 00:04:16,277
No, madam.
I noticed at the airport.

42
00:04:16,447 --> 00:04:17,243
Not true.

43
00:04:17,487 --> 00:04:20,001
- It's true. I did!
- You didn't.

44
00:04:20,167 --> 00:04:23,443
- Don't lie.
- I did notice.

45
00:04:25,527 --> 00:04:28,439
Come here, you.

46
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:35,840
Lord! That'll be Milly.

47
00:04:37,007 --> 00:04:38,645
She always has good timing.

48
00:04:38,927 --> 00:04:42,124
Someone's been calling
and hanging up all morning.

49
00:04:45,487 --> 00:04:46,522
Hello.

50
00:04:48,007 --> 00:04:50,567
Oh, it's you.

51
00:04:50,727 --> 00:04:51,364
Who is it?

52
00:04:53,647 --> 00:04:54,557
Yes.

53
00:04:55,447 --> 00:04:57,756
Well, I'll tell you later.
Yes, yes.

54
00:04:58,167 --> 00:05:00,635
In half an hour by DHL.

55
00:05:01,127 --> 00:05:02,082
Bye.

56
00:05:03,047 --> 00:05:05,925
- Who was it, Julio?
- They're a pain in the ass!

57
00:05:06,087 --> 00:05:07,202
It's Rodriguez.

58
00:05:07,367 --> 00:05:10,404
If I don't report to the
Writers' Union today, they'll flip.

59
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:12,046
Oh, Julio, come on!

60
00:05:12,207 --> 00:05:15,916
What can I do?
I've got to go.

61
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,435
Wait for me.

62
00:05:22,007 --> 00:05:23,360
What about Milly?

63
00:05:23,527 --> 00:05:25,836
She's not here.
I'll see her tonight.

64
00:05:46,887 --> 00:05:47,478
STOP

65
00:05:49,607 --> 00:05:51,165
Asshole!

66
00:05:51,647 --> 00:05:53,319
Shithead!

67
00:05:54,607 --> 00:05:56,404
Spanish cocksucker!

68
00:05:58,927 --> 00:06:00,360
DHL, Madame Silvia

69
00:06:01,847 --> 00:06:04,645
Hello. Look at Daddy!

70
00:06:04,807 --> 00:06:06,320
Say "Hello, Daddy"!

71
00:06:06,487 --> 00:06:08,045
How are you, Daddy?

72
00:06:11,807 --> 00:06:15,800
It's the neighbor's baby.
She's at the tax office.

73
00:06:19,447 --> 00:06:23,440
<i>Our affair lasted like two fish
on ice, or whisky on the rocks.</i>

74
00:06:23,847 --> 00:06:27,635
All this stuff wouldn’t even
fit on a hard disk.

75
00:06:27,807 --> 00:06:29,126
It's a miracle!

76
00:06:29,647 --> 00:06:32,445
Well, I just got back from
the Vatican.

77
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:34,721
Like them?

78
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:38,442
I said I wanted flat heels.
I'll Look Like a hooker.

79
00:06:42,287 --> 00:06:45,245
This is for underneath
and this is the dress.

80
00:06:46,647 --> 00:06:47,875
Put it on.

81
00:06:48,887 --> 00:06:50,320
- Go on, put it on!
- No, Julio.

82
00:06:50,487 --> 00:06:53,320
Please, come here.

83
00:07:02,607 --> 00:07:03,517
Right.

84
00:07:08,527 --> 00:07:09,642
Tell me about Europe.

85
00:07:12,247 --> 00:07:13,396
Europe...

86
00:07:15,847 --> 00:07:18,759
For the conference in Berlin

87
00:07:18,927 --> 00:07:21,964
they asked me
to sit in Goethe's chair.

88
00:07:22,287 --> 00:07:23,720
Will they publish the novel?

89
00:07:23,927 --> 00:07:25,679
Yes, yes.

90
00:07:26,327 --> 00:07:29,399
Two big publishers are after it.

91
00:07:30,207 --> 00:07:32,721
One in Italy
and another in Spain.

92
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:36,923
I'll hook one of them.

93
00:07:42,647 --> 00:07:44,842
I was so anxious this morning.

94
00:07:45,647 --> 00:07:48,320
I didn't know what flight
you were on.

95
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,643
But your wife always
answered the phone.

96
00:07:55,847 --> 00:07:57,803
I've got to go soon.

97
00:07:58,927 --> 00:08:00,963
I'm meant to be with Rodríguez.

98
00:08:02,487 --> 00:08:04,079
But you're coming tonight.

99
00:08:04,527 --> 00:08:06,882
Don't ask me that.
I just can't.

100
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:10,682
I haven't even seen Milly yet.
She was with her friend Judith.

101
00:08:12,007 --> 00:08:12,917
Judith?

102
00:08:15,087 --> 00:08:18,045
Judith is at Camagüey University.

103
00:08:18,327 --> 00:08:19,999
Milly must be with that man.

104
00:08:21,287 --> 00:08:22,356
What man?

105
00:08:24,247 --> 00:08:27,239
I don't know. Some strange guy,
around fifty.

106
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:28,396
What man?

107
00:08:29,047 --> 00:08:29,877
I don't know.

108
00:08:30,047 --> 00:08:31,685
I think he's foreign.

109
00:08:32,487 --> 00:08:35,718
He picks her up at
the faculty sometimes.

110
00:08:36,847 --> 00:08:38,599
Didn't your wife tell you?

111
00:08:57,927 --> 00:09:00,487
- Hello. Good evening.
- How are you?

112
00:09:01,127 --> 00:09:03,277
- Nice to see you.
- Same here.

113
00:09:05,527 --> 00:09:08,041
- Bye, mom.
- Bye. Have a good time.

114
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:13,443
Bye, dear.

115
00:09:13,607 --> 00:09:14,722
Have fun.

116
00:09:18,887 --> 00:09:23,278
<i>Shadows will be swept away
like dust unsettled</i>

117
00:09:23,487 --> 00:09:26,285
<i>when a window is opened.</i>

118
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:29,678
<i>Music in the air</i>

119
00:09:30,207 --> 00:09:32,721
<i>will again paint colors</i>

120
00:09:33,047 --> 00:09:35,766
<i>on embracing bodies.</i>

121
00:09:36,727 --> 00:09:40,720
<i>Not the chaste silence
of the dead,</i>

122
00:09:41,527 --> 00:09:44,564
<i>but a carnal touch,</i>

123
00:09:45,647 --> 00:09:48,639
<i>moist and alive.</i>

124
00:09:57,527 --> 00:09:58,562
And now...

125
00:09:59,367 --> 00:10:02,916
a poem from my own pen:

126
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,763
"The Pain of a Tear".

127
00:10:09,247 --> 00:10:09,884
What is it?

128
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,925
Julio del Toro is with us!

129
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,086
Please, a round of applause!

130
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:28,557
Were you going to
hide there all night, maestro?

131
00:10:28,887 --> 00:10:30,081
Read something for us.

132
00:10:30,727 --> 00:10:33,799
Julio del Toro is the author
of that classic novel,

133
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:37,676
"A Place For Two", winner of
a Casa de las Americas award.

134
00:10:41,127 --> 00:10:42,162
Good evening.

135
00:10:43,927 --> 00:10:47,920
No, I wasn't planning
on reading anything.

136
00:10:48,927 --> 00:10:52,442
I'm finishing my second novel.

137
00:10:52,647 --> 00:10:55,525
Superstitious, Like all writers.

138
00:10:56,047 --> 00:10:58,083
Then read from
"A Place for Two".

139
00:10:58,247 --> 00:11:01,284
- Look...
- I have a copy in my dressing...

140
00:11:01,447 --> 00:11:03,915
It's "Under the Sun".

141
00:11:04,207 --> 00:11:06,880
- The novel’s title...
- You're ridiculous.

142
00:11:07,287 --> 00:11:10,677
I'll never forgive you for
stalking me Like a jealous pimp.

143
00:11:11,367 --> 00:11:12,595
How old is he?

144
00:11:13,127 --> 00:11:14,765
Seventy? No, sixty.

145
00:11:15,127 --> 00:11:18,403
He's the age that he is.
I'm going to marry him.

146
00:11:18,807 --> 00:11:20,001
Shit!

147
00:11:20,167 --> 00:11:24,126
- I'll get you a towel.
- Yeah, and a T-shirt.

148
00:11:25,447 --> 00:11:28,962
- How old is he? Fifty-nine?
- Fifty-eight.

149
00:11:29,367 --> 00:11:32,803
But if a man eats Spanish beans,
ham, and cheese all his life,

150
00:11:32,967 --> 00:11:34,036
that doesn't matter.

151
00:11:34,607 --> 00:11:37,201
- That's not Marx's fault.
- Here.

152
00:11:38,007 --> 00:11:39,884
You're good at throwing in
the towel, aren't you?

153
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:42,163
Keep it down.
The whole block will hear.

154
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:45,205
- They don't need me to tell them.
- What's your problem?

155
00:11:45,367 --> 00:11:48,279
- That he's Spanish or he's your age?
- He's not my age.

156
00:11:48,447 --> 00:11:49,846
- He's thirteen years older.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

157
00:11:51,687 --> 00:11:52,836
My problem is you.

158
00:11:53,607 --> 00:11:56,724
You're my only daughter
and I love you.

159
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:01,799
You don't, or you wouldn’t
treat me Like a child.

160
00:12:02,207 --> 00:12:05,324
I'm in love with Noly
not because he's a Spaniard,

161
00:12:05,487 --> 00:12:09,321
but I Love that he is.
And I'm going with him.

162
00:12:10,887 --> 00:12:13,196
Did you think I'd stay here
all my life?

163
00:12:15,207 --> 00:12:16,083
You bought the thing.

164
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:20,401
I'm amazed how you
had it all worked out.

165
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:23,446
Who cares what
Julio del Toro thinks

166
00:12:23,967 --> 00:12:26,322
if some dashing old man
who studied with Franco

167
00:12:26,487 --> 00:12:30,480
- is chasing the Queen of Sheba?
- His name's Manuel Iznaga.

168
00:12:30,647 --> 00:12:33,161
He lives in Madrid,
works for a record company,

169
00:12:33,327 --> 00:12:36,080
- and is divorced with no children.
- That's what he says.

170
00:12:36,407 --> 00:12:40,241
Stop it, Julio! Milly isn't stupid
or a hooker.

171
00:12:40,447 --> 00:12:43,007
The man seems serious.
He's in Love with her.

172
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:45,078
You think I don't care
about my daughter?

173
00:12:46,047 --> 00:12:49,198
Know what? You're not
marrying that guy.

174
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:51,364
You'll get bored first.

175
00:12:53,127 --> 00:12:56,756
You know what a 60 year old
smells Like when he wakes up?

176
00:12:56,927 --> 00:12:58,679
No. Do you?

177
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,804
- Julio...
- I hate you!

178
00:13:36,247 --> 00:13:37,885
And she calls him Noly.

179
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,084
Have you got an aspirin?

180
00:13:45,007 --> 00:13:47,680
- No.
- Paracetamol? Neurofen?

181
00:13:50,407 --> 00:13:51,123
No.

182
00:13:51,287 --> 00:13:54,484
- I need a pain killer.
- Do you know what I need?

183
00:13:54,927 --> 00:13:57,282
A man who loves me.
It's that simple.

184
00:13:57,487 --> 00:14:02,003
Not a jerk who uses me Like a rag
and then bawls about

185
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:04,806
some Spaniard fucking
his daughter, or vice versa.

186
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:06,998
That's cruel.

187
00:14:07,927 --> 00:14:09,838
- I Love Milly above everything.
- Isn't that a fact?

188
00:14:10,087 --> 00:14:12,237
And that Noly is 13 years
older than I am!

189
00:14:12,647 --> 00:14:14,763
Poor soul, Listen to him.

190
00:14:15,727 --> 00:14:17,638
Who the hell am I
to fee sorry for you?

191
00:14:17,807 --> 00:14:19,957
Mother Theresa of Calcutta?

192
00:14:20,447 --> 00:14:21,562
Your daughter...

193
00:14:21,767 --> 00:14:24,440
Don't give me that Look!
She knows what she wants.

194
00:14:24,607 --> 00:14:26,325
It's more than you can say.

195
00:14:26,487 --> 00:14:27,158
I Love you.

196
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:31,962
Yeah, Look how much.

197
00:14:39,647 --> 00:14:41,478
Do you think I'm a fool?

198
00:14:43,527 --> 00:14:45,597
Well, yes I am.

199
00:14:47,647 --> 00:14:50,320
You know why?
For being in Love.

200
00:14:51,407 --> 00:14:53,796
You want things to
stay as they are.

201
00:14:54,007 --> 00:14:56,726
That cow covers your P.R.,

202
00:14:56,887 --> 00:15:00,402
I'm here for sex and to be
the Wailing Wall.

203
00:15:05,647 --> 00:15:07,558
Treat me bad.

204
00:15:08,567 --> 00:15:09,920
I Like it.

205
00:15:10,887 --> 00:15:14,846
I've been humoring you
for two years, Julio del Toro.

206
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:28,077
What?

207
00:15:32,887 --> 00:15:35,082
I don't know how Italians
can eat this.

208
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:37,562
They put more things into it.

209
00:15:38,247 --> 00:15:39,726
Miriam uses rosemary...

210
00:15:39,887 --> 00:15:42,640
What the hell to I care what
Miriam puts in spaghetti?

211
00:15:44,247 --> 00:15:45,043
All right.

212
00:15:51,487 --> 00:15:52,078
Look...

213
00:15:53,527 --> 00:15:56,166
Milly won't leave the Spaniard.

214
00:15:57,567 --> 00:16:01,162
You can bet on it. The calf wants
to spread her wings in Europe.

215
00:16:07,447 --> 00:16:09,199
That's what we need.

216
00:16:10,847 --> 00:16:12,997
If he wants the calf,

217
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,565
he may as well take the cow too.

218
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:18,080
Why do you talk Like that?

219
00:16:18,367 --> 00:16:20,756
Besides, you know
I can't do that.

220
00:16:22,927 --> 00:16:23,803
Oh, no?

221
00:16:24,927 --> 00:16:25,916
Hey!

222
00:16:28,407 --> 00:16:29,681
You Look thinner.

223
00:16:31,847 --> 00:16:34,281
Keeping trim.

224
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,957
In Europe, only tenors are fat.

225
00:16:37,727 --> 00:16:39,240
What's all this cleaning?

226
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:43,119
Half of the literature in
this country just gathers dust.

227
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,959
And the other half?

228
00:16:49,607 --> 00:16:52,280
They're going to publish
my new novel in Spain.

229
00:16:52,567 --> 00:16:53,477
Who?

230
00:16:54,887 --> 00:16:56,206
- It's a surprise.
- That's great.

231
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,684
Julio del Toro, superstar.

232
00:17:01,767 --> 00:17:03,598
You're the man I need.

233
00:17:05,727 --> 00:17:10,164
I work for Cubavision
and I need a cultural story.

234
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:14,239
You won the Casa Award
twenty years ago, right?

235
00:17:15,447 --> 00:17:16,163
No.

236
00:17:16,807 --> 00:17:17,842
Ten years.

237
00:17:18,127 --> 00:17:20,687
The Writer's Union is planning

238
00:17:21,727 --> 00:17:23,604
a tribute. I'm in charge.

239
00:17:23,767 --> 00:17:24,882
My name's Ana.

240
00:17:25,847 --> 00:17:26,916
Glad to meet you.

241
00:17:27,687 --> 00:17:28,642
It's a pleasure.

242
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:31,566
May I have your number?

243
00:17:32,407 --> 00:17:34,637
I'd Love to interview you.

244
00:17:37,567 --> 00:17:38,602
Tomorrow.

245
00:17:41,407 --> 00:17:42,681
Have you read my novel?

246
00:17:44,167 --> 00:17:44,997
No.

247
00:17:45,887 --> 00:17:47,559
But I will right after this one.

248
00:17:47,727 --> 00:17:48,716
THE NAME OF THE ROSE

249
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:52,885
It's funny.

250
00:17:53,687 --> 00:17:56,042
When I spoke at the Pompidou
in Paris,

251
00:17:56,207 --> 00:17:59,756
Umberto Eco was lecturing
in the next hall.

252
00:18:00,767 --> 00:18:03,281
It's a shame to miss that.

253
00:18:10,287 --> 00:18:11,959
Noly wants to talk to you.

254
00:18:16,087 --> 00:18:18,362
Here comes the sermon.

255
00:18:22,887 --> 00:18:24,161
Sorry about last night.

256
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:25,158
No.

257
00:18:25,727 --> 00:18:27,285
I can't help being your father.

258
00:18:28,447 --> 00:18:30,165
Or seeing you as a child.

259
00:18:30,447 --> 00:18:34,201
I won't understand till I have kids
and it's for my own good, right?

260
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,436
Oh, Dad.

261
00:18:37,327 --> 00:18:38,760
Milagros del Toro.

262
00:18:39,687 --> 00:18:41,598
When you buy a watch,

263
00:18:41,767 --> 00:18:44,440
don't be fooled by
cheap ones in the window.

264
00:18:44,847 --> 00:18:46,439
My boyfriend's a Rolex.

265
00:18:47,847 --> 00:18:50,964
Fifty-eight year olds
aren't called boyfriends.

266
00:18:51,127 --> 00:18:53,243
Since your watch has run down...

267
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:00,795
Sorry, Dad.

268
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,960
I didn't mean that.

269
00:19:08,287 --> 00:19:10,243
Where did I fail you, baby?

270
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:11,556
Where?

271
00:19:11,807 --> 00:19:13,001
Come on, Dad.

272
00:19:15,367 --> 00:19:17,676
Tell me a story.

273
00:19:18,127 --> 00:19:20,243
- Come on.
- No, no.

274
00:19:21,247 --> 00:19:24,603
Hey, give me that!

275
00:19:24,767 --> 00:19:26,280
Damn it, give me that!

276
00:19:28,487 --> 00:19:30,557
You’ll Like Noly. You’ll see.

277
00:19:30,927 --> 00:19:32,883
He's a learned man.

278
00:19:34,487 --> 00:19:36,364
He knows a lot about literature.

279
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:39,356
And he knows lots of people.

280
00:19:39,527 --> 00:19:40,437
Come on, Dad.

281
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:06,886
You know what, Julio?

282
00:20:07,327 --> 00:20:09,238
I've had a lot of jobs,

283
00:20:10,287 --> 00:20:12,437
but there are two things
I'll never be.

284
00:20:12,647 --> 00:20:15,002
- First a politician...
- No, no.

285
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:19,081
I don't care if you're Mayor
of Madrid or heir to the Bourbons.

286
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:21,479
That's not a problem.

287
00:20:22,967 --> 00:20:25,561
The second is a sex tourist.

288
00:20:26,447 --> 00:20:29,883
Look, this hadn't happened
to me in a long time.

289
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:33,884
I simply fell in Love.

290
00:20:35,487 --> 00:20:38,240
I understand you want
the best for Milly.

291
00:20:38,807 --> 00:20:41,275
I'd fee the same way.

292
00:20:43,447 --> 00:20:44,482
Let me see...

293
00:20:45,487 --> 00:20:46,442
Milly...

294
00:20:47,407 --> 00:20:49,398
is in Love with you too,

295
00:20:50,487 --> 00:20:54,480
and I've no right to interfere
in her feelings.

296
00:20:58,087 --> 00:21:00,078
That decision does you credit.

297
00:21:01,807 --> 00:21:04,605
What is it? I didn't want to
be disturbed.

298
00:21:06,727 --> 00:21:09,605
Tell him I'm looking for
a rock band.

299
00:21:09,767 --> 00:21:12,042
- He doesn't believe me.
- Yeah.

300
00:21:12,207 --> 00:21:14,437
Salsa, political "guaracha",
hip hop...

301
00:21:14,767 --> 00:21:18,646
Here, get rid of him.
Call security if you have to.

302
00:21:19,047 --> 00:21:21,607
They're mercenaries
and opportunists.

303
00:21:22,007 --> 00:21:24,237
- He can't see you.
- How come?

304
00:21:24,407 --> 00:21:27,399
Those people are fucking up
music in this country.

305
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,278
Political guaracha, shit!

306
00:21:30,527 --> 00:21:32,006
If my brother heard that...

307
00:21:32,487 --> 00:21:35,001
Is your brother
in the music business too?

308
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:37,078
No, he's in publishing.

309
00:21:37,647 --> 00:21:40,480
He's a manager at Tusquets.

310
00:21:41,807 --> 00:21:42,842
What is it?

311
00:21:44,007 --> 00:21:45,963
Know what?

312
00:21:46,767 --> 00:21:49,327
I've no calling as an experienced
fifty-something.

313
00:21:50,127 --> 00:21:53,437
I love that your daughter
doesn't expect me to lead her.

314
00:21:54,967 --> 00:21:57,720
Yes, she's self-confident.
She takes after me.

315
00:21:58,367 --> 00:22:02,326
Sure, and your wife is
extraordinary too.

316
00:22:04,327 --> 00:22:06,716
You don't even
understand yourself, Julio.

317
00:22:09,967 --> 00:22:12,356
Do you see any problem
in them getting married?

318
00:22:12,967 --> 00:22:17,518
He seems Like a serious,

319
00:22:17,687 --> 00:22:19,120
upright man.

320
00:22:19,527 --> 00:22:21,279
And he's good to Milly.

321
00:22:22,487 --> 00:22:24,398
We even spoke about literature.

322
00:22:24,607 --> 00:22:26,438
His brother's a writer.

323
00:22:29,327 --> 00:22:31,363
You're supposed to be happy.

324
00:22:34,047 --> 00:22:35,958
Yes. Of course I am.

325
00:22:40,727 --> 00:22:41,557
Hey...

326
00:22:43,047 --> 00:22:45,117
Did he say if they're leaving soon?

327
00:22:45,807 --> 00:22:46,557
No.

328
00:22:48,007 --> 00:22:52,125
He said he wanted to have
an engagement party.

329
00:22:57,367 --> 00:22:59,005
Julio is a good man.

330
00:22:59,327 --> 00:23:00,680
He's a real fighter.

331
00:23:01,927 --> 00:23:05,397
But this house could be
falling on his head

332
00:23:05,567 --> 00:23:07,000
and he wouldn’t notice.

333
00:23:07,407 --> 00:23:09,159
You'd have to tell him.

334
00:23:11,127 --> 00:23:13,402
But he has a gift
for making up stories,

335
00:23:13,847 --> 00:23:17,044
- for charming you with words.
- Does he still do it?

336
00:23:19,767 --> 00:23:21,359
This won't take any more.

337
00:23:21,527 --> 00:23:26,203
People don't see that this country
is always a hotbed of music.

338
00:23:26,567 --> 00:23:27,841
Good afternoon.

339
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:29,235
That's why...

340
00:23:34,087 --> 00:23:36,043
Oh, Julio!

341
00:23:40,247 --> 00:23:42,044
Silvia, my father
and my fiancé.

342
00:23:42,607 --> 00:23:43,722
Nice to meet you.

343
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:46,366
You Look Like the fiancé.

344
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:47,757
No.

345
00:23:48,807 --> 00:23:51,037
- No, he's the fiancé.
- Yes.

346
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:54,160
How silly of me!

347
00:23:54,647 --> 00:23:57,286
Dad, this is Silvia,
my architecture professor.

348
00:23:57,447 --> 00:23:59,677
I asked her to check the wall.

349
00:24:00,087 --> 00:24:00,963
The what?

350
00:24:03,687 --> 00:24:06,076
Oh, of course.

351
00:24:06,527 --> 00:24:09,519
You shouldn't have bothered
your teacher.

352
00:24:09,727 --> 00:24:12,639
It's just a little crack.

353
00:24:13,447 --> 00:24:16,962
No, no. It's quite serious.

354
00:24:17,727 --> 00:24:19,604
That's a main wall.

355
00:24:20,527 --> 00:24:23,644
Whatever you do,
do it quickly

356
00:24:24,167 --> 00:24:26,556
or things may get out of hand.

357
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:31,479
That’ll be mom.
She always forgets her keys.

358
00:24:34,927 --> 00:24:36,076
Are you nuts?

359
00:24:38,407 --> 00:24:39,920
- What's this here?
- Stop it!

360
00:24:43,047 --> 00:24:43,957
I'm Silvia.

361
00:24:51,447 --> 00:24:53,278
He knows about us, right?

362
00:25:04,927 --> 00:25:05,996
It's from Spain.

363
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:11,640
Milly and I are going to
Old Havana.

364
00:25:12,687 --> 00:25:15,042
Care to join us?

365
00:25:29,687 --> 00:25:30,802
Where's Milly?

366
00:25:31,487 --> 00:25:33,000
She's out with Manolo.

367
00:25:33,247 --> 00:25:37,206
The car broke down again.
I had to leave it at the hospital.

368
00:25:37,607 --> 00:25:39,563
Don't Look at me.
It's a miracle it runs.

369
00:25:39,727 --> 00:25:41,558
It's a Lada, you know?

370
00:25:41,727 --> 00:25:44,321
If I sang salsa instead of being
a gynecologist I'd have a Nissan.

371
00:25:51,047 --> 00:25:54,198
Some writers are springs
and others are mills.

372
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:56,484
Julio del Toro is a mill.

373
00:25:57,167 --> 00:26:01,160
He writes little,
but so did Juan Rulfo.

374
00:26:02,087 --> 00:26:03,998
What do you know
about his new novel?

375
00:26:05,087 --> 00:26:08,636
Julio has kept it secret
for the moment.

376
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:11,039
But the good news is

377
00:26:11,247 --> 00:26:14,205
he's reading a chapter
at the tribute.

378
00:26:21,087 --> 00:26:23,885
- Where was it?
- In a book by Milan Kundera...

379
00:26:24,127 --> 00:26:27,039
Sorry, it's probably banned here.

380
00:26:27,207 --> 00:26:29,960
We especially read
banned writers.

381
00:26:30,127 --> 00:26:32,482
And books by Cuban emigrants?

382
00:26:32,647 --> 00:26:36,083
Some artists only become known
after they leave.

383
00:26:36,247 --> 00:26:37,999
It sounds Like a recipe.

384
00:26:38,567 --> 00:26:41,604
Well, the book's called
"Life Is Elsewhere".

385
00:26:42,047 --> 00:26:43,560
Haven't you ever thought that...

386
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:46,036
Life is always elsewhere.

387
00:26:46,687 --> 00:26:50,885
Don't you come here looking for
utopias and black girls?

388
00:26:52,727 --> 00:26:53,876
Hello, everyone.

389
00:26:54,127 --> 00:26:55,799
- Hello, Manolo.
- How are you?

390
00:26:56,807 --> 00:26:57,876
Hello, Rodríguez.

391
00:26:58,407 --> 00:26:59,317
Hello, Julio.

392
00:27:04,367 --> 00:27:05,561
Silvia!

393
00:27:08,247 --> 00:27:10,283
- You Look fabulous.
- Thanks.

394
00:27:10,687 --> 00:27:13,281
I want to be Like you
when I'm older.

395
00:27:13,447 --> 00:27:15,244
And wear dresses Like this.

396
00:27:16,847 --> 00:27:18,519
Kids today are hopeless.

397
00:27:19,687 --> 00:27:21,006
Come on, Noly.

398
00:27:22,087 --> 00:27:25,124
- When are you getting married?
- Soon. In Madrid.

399
00:27:26,007 --> 00:27:28,521
Silvia's the coolest
teacher in the faculty.

400
00:27:28,687 --> 00:27:31,121
You'll see her dancing
Like crazy soon.

401
00:27:31,287 --> 00:27:34,324
I bet. And don't call me Noly.
It's Manolo.

402
00:27:34,607 --> 00:27:35,562
Okay, my love.

403
00:27:35,727 --> 00:27:37,445
I wish you all the best
with this crazy kid.

404
00:27:39,047 --> 00:27:42,562
I want to see Barcelona
and the Gaudi things first.

405
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:44,604
I owe that to this lady.

406
00:27:45,407 --> 00:27:49,036
Can you see us in Madrid,
away from my parents at last?

407
00:27:50,567 --> 00:27:51,795
Away from your parents?

408
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:52,843
Yes.

409
00:27:54,487 --> 00:27:57,365
You haven't told me
about the wedding dress.

410
00:28:09,447 --> 00:28:11,563
What is this hide and seek?

411
00:28:11,887 --> 00:28:15,721
You're bouncing around Like a ball.

412
00:28:16,407 --> 00:28:17,886
I was looking for you.

413
00:28:18,487 --> 00:28:21,604
That nice journalist, Ana, called.
She can't come.

414
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:23,325
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

415
00:28:23,487 --> 00:28:27,002
This is... Silvia, right?
Milly's professor.

416
00:28:27,167 --> 00:28:30,000
- She was checking the crack.
- I see.

417
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:32,840
I've told Julio he should
do something,

418
00:28:33,047 --> 00:28:36,323
but he waits until it's hopeless.

419
00:28:36,927 --> 00:28:38,440
- Yes.
- Nice to meet you.

420
00:28:39,687 --> 00:28:42,838
- Shit, what is this?
- Calm down.

421
00:28:43,007 --> 00:28:44,645
We've got a generator.

422
00:28:56,407 --> 00:28:59,160
- You piece of shit.
- Hey!

423
00:28:59,407 --> 00:29:00,123
Miriam isn't leaving.

424
00:29:00,967 --> 00:29:03,640
You're nuts. It's the men's room.
We may be seen.

425
00:29:03,807 --> 00:29:07,083
Give them a microscope.
You're a microbe anyway.

426
00:29:07,447 --> 00:29:08,721
Don't say that.

427
00:29:09,127 --> 00:29:10,719
- Miriam...
- Don't mention her.

428
00:29:11,447 --> 00:29:12,402
Okay.

429
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:16,921
Manolo offered but she
won't go. It's not my fault.

430
00:29:17,527 --> 00:29:19,165
Silvia, this is mad.

431
00:29:19,367 --> 00:29:22,120
- Why are you here? I'll call you.
- Your daughter invited me,

432
00:29:22,287 --> 00:29:25,085
and I'm glad I came
to see how useless you are.

433
00:29:25,247 --> 00:29:28,080
Hamlet was a babe in arms
compared to you.

434
00:29:28,247 --> 00:29:30,602
You're fucking up my life,
Julio del Toro.

435
00:29:31,047 --> 00:29:34,642
- Quiet. They’ll hear us.
- You're going to hear me!

436
00:29:34,807 --> 00:29:37,480
You'd get second place
in an dickhead contest.

437
00:29:38,367 --> 00:29:40,676
- Why not first?
- Because your dick...

438
00:29:42,887 --> 00:29:43,956
<i>... my beloved.</i>

439
00:29:44,127 --> 00:29:47,881
<i>I'd like to be in Asturias</i>

440
00:29:49,567 --> 00:29:51,876
<i>all the time...</i>

441
00:30:11,407 --> 00:30:12,396
Shit!

442
00:30:12,967 --> 00:30:14,685
I talked to my brother.

443
00:30:15,287 --> 00:30:16,640
He's interested.

444
00:30:17,527 --> 00:30:21,884
He asked if you'd sent
the novel to other publishers.

445
00:30:22,527 --> 00:30:23,403
No.

446
00:30:24,367 --> 00:30:25,800
Know what, Julio?

447
00:30:26,967 --> 00:30:31,677
Nobody at the party is Like
your queen and your princess.

448
00:30:32,007 --> 00:30:33,838
Not even that Silvia.

449
00:30:35,287 --> 00:30:37,562
Did you see her shoes?

450
00:30:37,727 --> 00:30:39,524
They're for a cheap whore.

451
00:30:40,327 --> 00:30:41,521
Very cheap!

452
00:30:42,487 --> 00:30:43,556
Silvia.

453
00:30:44,047 --> 00:30:45,765
Silvia, please.

454
00:30:46,527 --> 00:30:47,960
- Silvia!
- Let go of me.

455
00:30:48,127 --> 00:30:50,038
I'm a cheap whore.

456
00:30:50,447 --> 00:30:53,200
Don't listen to that drunk.

457
00:30:54,047 --> 00:30:57,005
I can still convince Miriam to go.

458
00:30:59,287 --> 00:31:00,117
Munuñi!

459
00:31:00,527 --> 00:31:01,482
Munuñi!

460
00:31:02,207 --> 00:31:04,402
- Silvia! Silvia!
- Here.

461
00:31:04,567 --> 00:31:05,158
Silvia!

462
00:31:05,407 --> 00:31:07,159
It's over, Julio del Toro.
Over!

463
00:31:08,807 --> 00:31:09,762
Here.

464
00:31:10,087 --> 00:31:10,997
Here.

465
00:31:12,047 --> 00:31:13,241
One more thing.

466
00:31:13,767 --> 00:31:17,965
I'm going to sleep with
the first man I come across.

467
00:31:22,567 --> 00:31:23,477
Silvia!

468
00:32:03,327 --> 00:32:06,285
Shit, now that's all I need.

469
00:32:10,447 --> 00:32:12,802
Need a hand, ma'am?

470
00:32:18,047 --> 00:32:21,676
What I mess with my Left,
I fix with my right.

471
00:32:22,727 --> 00:32:23,796
Shit, man!

472
00:32:25,607 --> 00:32:27,518
- Car trouble?
- No.

473
00:32:28,007 --> 00:32:30,237
I'm barking at the moon.

474
00:32:51,247 --> 00:32:52,726
This is torture.

475
00:32:53,087 --> 00:32:55,362
Go in. You could get pneumonia.

476
00:32:57,887 --> 00:33:00,242
Like some coffee or something?

477
00:33:00,647 --> 00:33:01,238
Well...

478
00:33:01,887 --> 00:33:03,002
Define "something".

479
00:33:07,487 --> 00:33:08,442
Something.

480
00:33:11,247 --> 00:33:13,078
No, thank you.
I'm in a hurry.

481
00:33:13,287 --> 00:33:14,800
I'm meeting a friend.

482
00:33:15,407 --> 00:33:16,237
Okay.

483
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:18,358
Then I can't return your sweater.

484
00:33:19,047 --> 00:33:22,119
You'll have to come for it.

485
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,285
Let's say Thursday night.

486
00:33:25,727 --> 00:33:28,719
Your problem isn't men,
it's clothing, right?

487
00:33:30,927 --> 00:33:34,283
No, really.
It was a funny way to meet but...

488
00:33:34,927 --> 00:33:37,600
something tells me
you're not Like other men.

489
00:33:41,807 --> 00:33:42,922
I'll wait for you.

490
00:33:43,887 --> 00:33:45,639
It will be a pleasure, Milady.

491
00:33:49,287 --> 00:33:49,924
Bye.

492
00:33:57,247 --> 00:33:58,726
What are your future plans?

493
00:34:04,327 --> 00:34:07,319
The two big publishers
rejected my work.

494
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:12,120
Now my only chance
is with Tusquets.

495
00:34:14,047 --> 00:34:16,277
What plans should I have?

496
00:34:18,007 --> 00:34:19,884
A tribute and a heart attack.

497
00:34:21,687 --> 00:34:26,363
They only give tributes to those
with one foot in the grave.

498
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:28,000
You won't say that
on camera, will you?

499
00:34:31,967 --> 00:34:33,559
There's something else, right?

500
00:34:36,847 --> 00:34:39,202
I finished "A Place under the Sun"
last night.

501
00:34:39,847 --> 00:34:40,962
Poor thing.

502
00:34:43,207 --> 00:34:44,606
But no way,

503
00:34:46,007 --> 00:34:47,201
I beat you.

504
00:34:47,687 --> 00:34:52,124
<i>I spent last night alone
in this armchair,</i>

505
00:34:52,287 --> 00:34:53,879
<i>wrapped up in self-pity.</i>

506
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:57,476
Do you Like it?

507
00:34:58,487 --> 00:34:59,397
Yes.

508
00:35:01,367 --> 00:35:02,243
Cheers.

509
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:05,957
<i>... with my head full
of demons.</i>

510
00:35:07,087 --> 00:35:08,406
Do you Like it hot?

511
00:35:12,007 --> 00:35:12,723
I love it.

512
00:35:12,887 --> 00:35:16,675
<i>Then you must try my speciality:
Penne a la raviatta.</i>

513
00:35:18,727 --> 00:35:20,877
- Penis?
- Yeah.

514
00:35:21,567 --> 00:35:23,159
Yes, short pasta.

515
00:35:24,367 --> 00:35:26,801
It doesn't matter.
I'm sure I'll love it.

516
00:35:34,367 --> 00:35:36,722
<i>And not knowing
what to do with my life.</i>

517
00:35:38,727 --> 00:35:40,240
I learned it in Italy.

518
00:35:41,887 --> 00:35:44,196
I didn't get a medal
in gymnastics.

519
00:35:45,247 --> 00:35:48,000
That was the death
of a sportsman with a future

520
00:35:48,247 --> 00:35:49,965
and the birth
of a masseur with a past.

521
00:35:53,607 --> 00:35:54,926
I...

522
00:35:56,447 --> 00:35:58,915
I had a boyfriend
who was a fencing champion.

523
00:35:59,367 --> 00:36:00,402
Did you?

524
00:36:01,447 --> 00:36:02,675
But I Left him.

525
00:36:03,927 --> 00:36:05,326
I broke it off because...

526
00:36:06,607 --> 00:36:09,644
he liked to wear his mask
when we made love.

527
00:36:13,047 --> 00:36:15,163
I'd rather have a masseur

528
00:36:15,767 --> 00:36:17,041
who can cook.

529
00:36:19,087 --> 00:36:21,078
<i>... until I arrived
at a decision...</i>

530
00:36:37,367 --> 00:36:39,278
Aren't you getting the phone?

531
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:44,838
Hello.

532
00:36:45,647 --> 00:36:46,477
Silvia!

533
00:36:47,487 --> 00:36:49,603
- It's for you.
- For me?

534
00:36:49,927 --> 00:36:50,882
For you.

535
00:36:51,927 --> 00:36:52,757
Hello.

536
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:56,436
<i>Hello.</i>

537
00:36:57,087 --> 00:36:58,042
Hello.

538
00:37:00,687 --> 00:37:02,006
Julio!

539
00:37:05,047 --> 00:37:06,275
Are they still bothering us

540
00:37:06,447 --> 00:37:07,641
<i>with those calls?</i>

541
00:37:11,447 --> 00:37:12,766
What do you think?

542
00:37:16,887 --> 00:37:19,003
I'll treat you to a peach tea.

543
00:37:25,127 --> 00:37:26,879
It's the best thing
that's ever happened.

544
00:37:28,447 --> 00:37:30,039
I heard that two years ago.

545
00:37:30,807 --> 00:37:32,843
Silvia was Silvia.

546
00:37:34,647 --> 00:37:35,716
But Ana...

547
00:37:37,087 --> 00:37:38,406
She smells like...

548
00:37:39,967 --> 00:37:41,605
- I could eat her up.
- Of course.

549
00:37:42,127 --> 00:37:44,118
Love is Platonic cannibalism.

550
00:37:45,047 --> 00:37:48,437
You can only own someone
by eating them.

551
00:37:51,087 --> 00:37:52,600
You're rather cynical today.

552
00:37:52,927 --> 00:37:54,804
I can't be a good cynic.

553
00:37:55,047 --> 00:37:56,162
I'm not married.

554
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:05,958
Miriam!

555
00:38:07,407 --> 00:38:08,522
<i>With what money?</i>

556
00:38:08,767 --> 00:38:09,722
With yours.

557
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:10,956
You don't say!

558
00:38:11,167 --> 00:38:13,158
The car's still at the garage.

559
00:38:13,487 --> 00:38:16,126
Do you think that's for free?

560
00:38:16,287 --> 00:38:18,801
What will we live on
if we use that money?

561
00:38:19,087 --> 00:38:22,159
I'm doing what you said
when you came back.

562
00:38:22,327 --> 00:38:25,046
The house is a wreck.
When the novel's published,

563
00:38:25,207 --> 00:38:27,482
- you'll see...
- That'll take time.

564
00:38:27,887 --> 00:38:31,721
Manolo said he'll lend us
some money.

565
00:38:31,927 --> 00:38:33,997
It can't all be about Manolo.

566
00:38:34,167 --> 00:38:36,840
No, Julio, no way.

567
00:38:37,167 --> 00:38:40,842
Get the money now
or I'll ask Manolo for it.

568
00:38:41,007 --> 00:38:43,362
- You know what your problem is?
- Excuse me.

569
00:38:43,527 --> 00:38:45,085
Can I get some water?

570
00:38:47,167 --> 00:38:50,523
No, first tell him his problem.
I'll wait.

571
00:38:54,967 --> 00:38:56,719
You'll cause an accident.

572
00:38:56,887 --> 00:38:57,797
STOP

573
00:38:57,967 --> 00:38:59,639
I see it clearly now.

574
00:39:00,487 --> 00:39:02,876
The third person doesn't work.

575
00:39:03,567 --> 00:39:05,603
I'll rewrite everything
in first person.

576
00:39:05,887 --> 00:39:07,445
Will you let me read it?

577
00:39:08,367 --> 00:39:11,598
Even better, I'll write it here.

578
00:39:17,367 --> 00:39:20,279
Were you in love with
your father as a girl?

579
00:39:20,767 --> 00:39:21,563
No.

580
00:39:22,967 --> 00:39:24,525
Mikhail Gorbachov.

581
00:39:27,287 --> 00:39:28,720
No, seriously.

582
00:39:31,527 --> 00:39:34,200
I'm trying to understand
why you're doing this.

583
00:39:35,527 --> 00:39:37,199
For humanitarian reasons.

584
00:39:37,847 --> 00:39:38,597
Hey...

585
00:39:41,487 --> 00:39:42,840
Don't pity me!

586
00:39:44,847 --> 00:39:45,563
Why not?

587
00:39:45,727 --> 00:39:49,163
I'll be damned
if I don't sue them!

588
00:39:49,327 --> 00:39:52,763
They'll see what
foreign debt really is!

589
00:39:53,327 --> 00:39:54,237
What happened?

590
00:39:54,407 --> 00:39:57,922
Manolo went to buy plane
tickets and ran into a bus.

591
00:39:59,007 --> 00:40:00,998
He says that yesterday
there was a Stop sign,

592
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:02,759
but it wasn't there today
and he drove on.

593
00:40:03,087 --> 00:40:03,678
Shit.

594
00:40:03,847 --> 00:40:05,838
Hey get it right,
it was his fault.

595
00:40:07,007 --> 00:40:10,044
- Who are you?
- Leoncio Rocasolano.

596
00:40:10,447 --> 00:40:13,086
It was a bus from Pinar del Rio,
with a salsa band

597
00:40:13,247 --> 00:40:15,681
called Hard Sex.

598
00:40:15,967 --> 00:40:16,956
Heavy Sex.

599
00:40:17,527 --> 00:40:21,315
We play salsa, hip hop,
political guaracha, and anywhere.

600
00:40:21,487 --> 00:40:23,557
You'll hear from me, Heavy Sex.

601
00:40:24,567 --> 00:40:25,966
What happened to you?

602
00:40:27,127 --> 00:40:29,243
Oh, nothing. It's nothing.

603
00:40:29,967 --> 00:40:31,400
Some moron on a bike.

604
00:40:38,647 --> 00:40:40,683
I'd better stay with him.

605
00:40:40,927 --> 00:40:42,519
It's a man's thing.

606
00:40:42,767 --> 00:40:45,076
On the contrary.
Didn't you hear him?

607
00:40:45,367 --> 00:40:47,722
Milly stays, of course,
and I'm a doctor.

608
00:40:47,887 --> 00:40:50,276
Why do you have to
take care of him?

609
00:40:50,447 --> 00:40:52,199
Are you curious about Spaniards?

610
00:40:52,407 --> 00:40:54,159
Very funny.

611
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:57,364
A naked Spaniard won't raise
my blood pressure at my age.

612
00:40:58,567 --> 00:41:00,080
Besides, I have to talk to him.

613
00:41:01,287 --> 00:41:03,243
- You're not going to ask him for...
- Hey.

614
00:41:03,407 --> 00:41:07,559
The builders want their money
by next week or they stop work.

615
00:41:11,087 --> 00:41:13,681
We're playing the Casa
de la Musica.

616
00:41:14,407 --> 00:41:16,398
Ask for Rocasolano, right?

617
00:41:23,327 --> 00:41:24,760
Relax.

618
00:41:25,927 --> 00:41:29,044
A magazine in Barcelona
owes me for an article.

619
00:41:31,847 --> 00:41:32,677
Bye.

620
00:41:33,807 --> 00:41:34,922
Fresh air!

621
00:41:42,447 --> 00:41:44,039
Political guaracha!

622
00:41:45,207 --> 00:41:46,401
Fuck that!

623
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,726
Political guaracha?

624
00:42:14,887 --> 00:42:15,956
Please...

625
00:42:16,527 --> 00:42:18,802
Ask the nurse
not to let anyone in.

626
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:20,326
I'm the nurse.

627
00:42:20,847 --> 00:42:22,485
Did you study music?

628
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:23,956
Philosophy.

629
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:27,682
But I left it in fourth year.

630
00:42:28,567 --> 00:42:30,159
Music is life at the max, man.

631
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:32,165
To get ahead in this world,

632
00:42:32,527 --> 00:42:36,520
you have to be a Marxist,
an existentialist,

633
00:42:36,727 --> 00:42:37,921
and an obscurantist.

634
00:42:39,287 --> 00:42:42,359
Know what?
I never liked salsa music.

635
00:42:42,567 --> 00:42:46,321
Salsa has its Shakespeares,
its Cervantes...

636
00:42:46,847 --> 00:42:48,565
even its James Joyces.

637
00:42:49,927 --> 00:42:51,440
And it's still pop culture.

638
00:42:53,727 --> 00:42:55,046
I prefer classic rock.

639
00:42:55,287 --> 00:42:56,845
We're not discussing taste.

640
00:42:58,287 --> 00:42:59,925
Want me to tell you the truth?

641
00:43:00,127 --> 00:43:04,120
What I really dig
is European folk music,

642
00:43:04,447 --> 00:43:05,596
flamenco singing,

643
00:43:05,927 --> 00:43:08,122
Tyrolean songs, the "jota".

644
00:43:09,247 --> 00:43:10,123
But...

645
00:43:10,607 --> 00:43:14,361
you can live for two years
with a salsa hit.

646
00:43:22,727 --> 00:43:24,718
Who writes your lyrics?

647
00:43:25,807 --> 00:43:28,275
Do you want to go dancing
at the Casa de la Música?

648
00:43:28,967 --> 00:43:30,923
With your foot like this?

649
00:43:32,407 --> 00:43:35,046
Don't promise more than
you can deliver.

650
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,596
Was each of these traffic signs

651
00:43:45,767 --> 00:43:48,804
given to you by a different man?

652
00:43:51,967 --> 00:43:55,164
The Universal Declaration
of Human Rights says it:

653
00:43:57,247 --> 00:43:58,965
All men are equal.

654
00:44:09,327 --> 00:44:11,557
A woman gave me one.

655
00:44:21,847 --> 00:44:25,044
Want me to leave it all
and stay here with you?

656
00:44:26,567 --> 00:44:27,795
Know what?

657
00:44:42,327 --> 00:44:44,079
Your wife is a great woman.

658
00:44:46,527 --> 00:44:49,121
You'll only see that
the day you lose her.

659
00:44:50,607 --> 00:44:51,483
Write.

660
00:44:59,567 --> 00:45:00,283
Munuñi.

661
00:45:15,847 --> 00:45:19,362
SHARPEN MY PENCIL, BABY

662
00:45:19,527 --> 00:45:23,805
WITH YOUR LUSCIOUS SHARPENER

663
00:45:38,607 --> 00:45:39,596
Are you leaving?

664
00:45:40,047 --> 00:45:42,402
I am. I'll be back late.

665
00:45:43,567 --> 00:45:46,445
- Very late?
- Very, very late.

666
00:45:47,287 --> 00:45:49,403
Sit down. The doctor
will see you soon.

667
00:45:49,567 --> 00:45:51,046
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

668
00:46:02,407 --> 00:46:03,362
Silvia?

669
00:46:04,967 --> 00:46:07,527
- Where's my doctor?
- She's on leave.

670
00:46:07,687 --> 00:46:11,236
What's up? You look like
you saw a ghost.

671
00:46:13,327 --> 00:46:14,123
Ten weeks.

672
00:46:16,047 --> 00:46:17,036
Are you sure?

673
00:47:13,447 --> 00:47:14,357
- Silvia!
- David!

674
00:47:14,607 --> 00:47:16,882
This isn't what you think!

675
00:47:17,047 --> 00:47:18,799
I'll kill that slut!

676
00:47:23,727 --> 00:47:24,637
Let me explain!

677
00:47:25,647 --> 00:47:27,603
- David!
- I told you so.

678
00:47:30,087 --> 00:47:30,997
This is Diego.

679
00:47:31,687 --> 00:47:32,881
Silvia!

680
00:47:33,167 --> 00:47:35,840
Why is she wearing my jocks?

681
00:48:45,447 --> 00:48:47,836
Heavy Sex...

682
00:48:48,087 --> 00:48:51,636
is honored with the presence of
two great figures.

683
00:48:52,607 --> 00:48:55,599
From Spain, our manager,
Manolo Iznaga.

684
00:48:57,807 --> 00:48:59,684
And from home, a great friend,

685
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:01,996
Julio del Toro,

686
00:49:04,967 --> 00:49:08,880
a great Cuban writer.
A kiss for you and your family.

687
00:49:11,767 --> 00:49:12,802
Heavy Sex.

688
00:49:16,447 --> 00:49:18,438
Since you're into salsa now...

689
00:49:19,047 --> 00:49:21,641
Julio, Tusquets take time
in analyzing a book.

690
00:49:21,807 --> 00:49:25,163
I never said it would be fast.
They're pros.

691
00:49:26,007 --> 00:49:28,521
They have better lyrics now.

692
00:49:29,247 --> 00:49:32,125
Know what?
I don't care about lyrics.

693
00:49:54,607 --> 00:49:57,838
Since Heavy Sex is leaving
for Spain soon,

694
00:49:58,647 --> 00:50:02,560
we're going to play
our hit over there:

695
00:50:03,447 --> 00:50:05,165
"Sharpen My Pencil, Baby".

696
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:11,515
Will the prettiest nurse in
the West Indies dance with me?

697
00:50:11,807 --> 00:50:15,402
If my father-in-law doesn't mind.

698
00:50:15,567 --> 00:50:17,603
- She's all yours.
- A pleasure.

699
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:27,284
<i>Sharpen my pencil, baby</i>

700
00:50:27,447 --> 00:50:30,883
<i>with your luscious sharpener.
If my lead is sharp,</i>

701
00:50:31,047 --> 00:50:32,321
<i>my tongue will feel it.</i>

702
00:50:33,047 --> 00:50:35,083
Milly is so vulnerable.

703
00:50:35,447 --> 00:50:36,800
She needs guidance.

704
00:50:38,607 --> 00:50:40,598
- Like you?
- No.

705
00:50:41,007 --> 00:50:42,122
Like Julio.

706
00:50:44,487 --> 00:50:46,955
Your mom still looks great,
doesn't she?

707
00:50:48,127 --> 00:50:50,436
She doesn't deserve
what you're doing.

708
00:50:51,367 --> 00:50:52,516
What am I doing?

709
00:50:55,247 --> 00:50:58,478
At her age women complain
about what you don't do.

710
00:50:58,767 --> 00:51:02,282
And being gross as well.
You know what I'm saying.

711
00:51:03,247 --> 00:51:05,124
You should be ashamed.

712
00:51:06,047 --> 00:51:06,923
Well, no.

713
00:51:07,247 --> 00:51:08,919
She's the one who's disgusting.

714
00:51:09,967 --> 00:51:11,559
- She?
- Yeah.

715
00:51:11,887 --> 00:51:13,002
Your lover.

716
00:51:13,167 --> 00:51:15,886
The one you give things to,
no matter what.

717
00:51:17,447 --> 00:51:19,324
<i>For it was
with your pencil sharpener</i>

718
00:51:19,487 --> 00:51:22,877
<i>That I sharpened my lead
one fine night.</i>

719
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:24,916
<i>Come on!</i>

720
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:27,600
<i>Sharpen me!</i>

721
00:51:29,567 --> 00:51:32,400
<i>Mambo, mambo!</i>

722
00:51:33,327 --> 00:51:34,442
<i>Come on!</i>

723
00:51:35,687 --> 00:51:37,245
<i>Sharpen me.</i>

724
00:51:38,807 --> 00:51:41,605
I'm sorry.
I'm not good at dancing.

725
00:51:43,007 --> 00:51:44,804
I've only a vague idea.

726
00:51:45,447 --> 00:51:47,642
- Want me to lead?
- All right.

727
00:51:51,687 --> 00:51:53,359
I thought that slut was my friend.

728
00:51:53,887 --> 00:51:55,798
- You know each other?
- Are you drunk?

729
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:58,243
Don't you remember
she was my teacher?

730
00:51:59,367 --> 00:52:02,086
I found the red dress
in the garage.

731
00:52:02,407 --> 00:52:04,602
You didn't even have
the balls to...

732
00:52:06,367 --> 00:52:09,165
Hang on, we're talking
about Silvia, right?

733
00:52:09,447 --> 00:52:11,836
Of course, who else?

734
00:52:12,607 --> 00:52:14,438
Milly, that's over.

735
00:52:14,967 --> 00:52:16,286
I swear. It's over.

736
00:52:21,967 --> 00:52:23,036
I won't help.

737
00:52:23,207 --> 00:52:25,243
Then I'll get another doctor
for the termination.

738
00:52:25,407 --> 00:52:26,840
- Look...
- Don't you see?

739
00:52:27,087 --> 00:52:31,080
I've got the devil's seed
inside me, Rosemary's baby.

740
00:52:32,887 --> 00:52:36,163
You're on the borderline.

741
00:52:36,807 --> 00:52:40,004
Termination now would
endanger your life

742
00:52:40,167 --> 00:52:42,203
and nobody will take that risk.

743
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:45,006
The father is bisexual.
So what?

744
00:52:47,007 --> 00:52:49,726
Nothing. That's normal, right?

745
00:52:50,607 --> 00:52:53,246
It's not common,
but it's not abnormal either.

746
00:52:54,607 --> 00:52:56,006
He was a man in bed, right?

747
00:52:57,367 --> 00:52:59,437
Let's say there's time,
and there isn't,

748
00:53:00,647 --> 00:53:04,435
would you deny yourself the joy
of motherhood because of

749
00:53:05,767 --> 00:53:06,836
one mistake?

750
00:53:28,767 --> 00:53:30,120
Who's that man?

751
00:53:32,527 --> 00:53:34,882
- Bolaño's father.
- And an admirer,

752
00:53:35,247 --> 00:53:36,236
maestro del Toro.

753
00:53:37,567 --> 00:53:41,355
Come on, read fast.
If Manolo comes in

754
00:53:41,527 --> 00:53:42,926
I'll have a stroke.

755
00:53:43,087 --> 00:53:47,399
The boss will never find out
about your poetic streak.

756
00:53:48,167 --> 00:53:50,522
- Does the chorus start here?
- No, here.

757
00:53:50,687 --> 00:53:54,316
"I dreamt your love story,
pulsating under the sun."

758
00:53:55,207 --> 00:53:57,084
Isn't it a bit highbrow?

759
00:53:57,247 --> 00:53:59,158
<i>Sharpen my pencil, baby</i>

760
00:53:59,487 --> 00:54:02,524
<i>with your luscious sharpener
If my lead is sharp...</i>

761
00:54:03,287 --> 00:54:04,481
Turn that off.

762
00:54:04,807 --> 00:54:07,002
<i>I'll write you
a thousand poems...</i>

763
00:54:21,287 --> 00:54:22,606
Hey, wait!

764
00:54:23,807 --> 00:54:25,081
What was I saying there?

765
00:54:28,167 --> 00:54:29,236
Imagine...

766
00:54:32,607 --> 00:54:34,802
We didn't need Milly then.

767
00:54:38,087 --> 00:54:39,236
What do you mean?

768
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:49,206
Do you still fancy me?

769
00:54:52,447 --> 00:54:54,802
Would I be with you
if I didn't?

770
00:54:54,967 --> 00:54:55,683
You tell me.

771
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:58,405
All right then.

772
00:54:59,127 --> 00:55:01,846
What did you want to say
about your work?

773
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:03,963
Don't ask if you're not interested.

774
00:55:04,127 --> 00:55:06,038
You're the king of the universe.

775
00:55:08,527 --> 00:55:10,882
Stop it, will you?

776
00:55:11,287 --> 00:55:12,515
Have you cheated on me?

777
00:55:16,447 --> 00:55:18,358
Don't start it, don't.

778
00:55:18,847 --> 00:55:19,962
I don't want to hear that

779
00:55:20,127 --> 00:55:23,119
if I tell the truth you'll
understand and forgive me.

780
00:55:23,287 --> 00:55:24,925
No. I'd never say that.

781
00:55:25,087 --> 00:55:27,885
If I found out, I'd slap you
and leave you.

782
00:55:29,127 --> 00:55:30,082
Come here.

783
00:55:38,567 --> 00:55:41,400
What matters is that
we're growing old together.

784
00:55:42,887 --> 00:55:43,717
Yes, Julio.

785
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,401
We're growing old

786
00:55:45,687 --> 00:55:47,006
and Milly is leaving us.

787
00:55:50,327 --> 00:55:51,442
I still love you.

788
00:56:25,647 --> 00:56:26,716
Munuñi!

789
00:56:28,407 --> 00:56:29,396
Munuñi!

790
00:56:33,407 --> 00:56:35,875
<i>Everything was easier
for that generation.</i>

791
00:56:36,287 --> 00:56:37,959
<i>Nobody could write
a book like that now.</i>

792
00:56:38,127 --> 00:56:40,595
<i>Not even my father.</i>

793
00:56:41,487 --> 00:56:42,966
<i>It is as if,
in that moment,</i>

794
00:56:43,127 --> 00:56:46,164
<i>society and writers
were the same age.</i>

795
00:56:47,327 --> 00:56:48,806
<i>Only in that moment.</i>

796
00:56:58,927 --> 00:56:59,916
Forgive me.

797
00:57:05,007 --> 00:57:07,362
It's like when somebody dies,
you know?

798
00:57:07,567 --> 00:57:08,920
I don't like it either.

799
00:57:09,087 --> 00:57:11,726
- That's why I wanted you to see it.
- No, you don't understand.

800
00:57:11,887 --> 00:57:12,876
I love it.

801
00:57:15,647 --> 00:57:17,399
At that time, Julio was...

802
00:57:20,207 --> 00:57:21,242
adorable.

803
00:57:23,927 --> 00:57:26,236
You should think more
about yourself, Miriam.

804
00:57:30,807 --> 00:57:32,843
Years ago, when you finished,

805
00:57:33,247 --> 00:57:35,158
you had a heap of pages to show.

806
00:57:37,127 --> 00:57:39,243
- It's not transparent.
- Yes.

807
00:57:39,647 --> 00:57:40,636
It is.

808
00:57:58,927 --> 00:58:01,805
I came to see you this morning.

809
00:58:07,127 --> 00:58:09,721
You weren't in,
or maybe you were.

810
00:58:10,367 --> 00:58:12,756
They wouldn't open the door.

811
00:58:13,647 --> 00:58:14,875
Let's celebrate.

812
00:58:38,727 --> 00:58:40,957
Sensitive, attractive,

813
00:58:41,407 --> 00:58:43,557
thoughtful, learned.

814
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:45,206
And a great dancer.

815
00:58:45,367 --> 00:58:47,085
We've run out of things
to talk about.

816
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:51,122
I don't get it. In the hospital
we talked all the time.

817
00:58:51,287 --> 00:58:53,084
Sure, you're both old.

818
00:58:54,247 --> 00:58:55,680
I mean, the same age.

819
00:58:56,167 --> 00:58:58,442
And the smell...
Dad was right.

820
00:58:59,567 --> 00:59:02,286
- Expensive perfume.
- Old man's smell.

821
00:59:02,647 --> 00:59:03,875
Are you a genius?

822
00:59:06,847 --> 00:59:07,677
Yes.

823
00:59:17,007 --> 00:59:19,202
- Where were you this morning?
- Today?

824
00:59:21,647 --> 00:59:22,921
At the studio,

825
00:59:23,847 --> 00:59:25,075
editing a story.

826
00:59:25,927 --> 00:59:28,077
I lent the flat to a friend.

827
00:59:32,167 --> 00:59:33,236
Do I have to believe you?

828
00:59:33,407 --> 00:59:34,078
No.

829
00:59:34,567 --> 00:59:35,636
Do you love me?

830
00:59:35,927 --> 00:59:37,758
You had your three questions:

831
00:59:39,247 --> 00:59:40,726
If I was a genius,

832
00:59:41,367 --> 00:59:43,119
where was I this morning

833
00:59:43,327 --> 00:59:45,522
and if you had to believe me.

834
00:59:46,367 --> 00:59:47,402
Seriously.

835
00:59:49,447 --> 00:59:50,243
Do you love me?

836
01:00:01,047 --> 01:00:02,321
Shit, why?

837
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:05,599
Because it's killing me,
you hear me?

838
01:00:06,087 --> 01:00:09,363
I can't go on making up meetings
with writers

839
01:00:09,767 --> 01:00:11,803
and juries
in provincial contests.

840
01:00:11,967 --> 01:00:13,116
My wife will think that

841
01:00:13,287 --> 01:00:15,926
in the last 6 weeks literature
is having a bigger boom

842
01:00:16,087 --> 01:00:17,998
than in the Spanish Golden Age.

843
01:00:18,367 --> 01:00:19,766
And I can't leave her

844
01:00:19,927 --> 01:00:22,680
because you don't want me
here all the time.

845
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:26,398
I don't know if you love me,
admire me or pity me.

846
01:00:26,567 --> 01:00:29,684
I don't know what the hell
you're doing with me.

847
01:00:31,887 --> 01:00:34,526
I don't know if I
should be jealous.

848
01:00:35,887 --> 01:00:39,846
I thought that love driving
you mad was just a metaphor.

849
01:00:40,567 --> 01:00:42,046
Don't go, my love.

850
01:00:46,607 --> 01:00:47,517
Okay.

851
01:00:50,167 --> 01:00:51,520
It's your turn now.

852
01:00:51,967 --> 01:00:52,922
All right?

853
01:00:53,327 --> 01:00:54,123
What?

854
01:00:55,247 --> 01:00:57,238
I'll let you ask three questions.

855
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:07,164
I have nothing to ask.

856
01:01:07,367 --> 01:01:09,005
"He had relinquished that right.

857
01:01:09,167 --> 01:01:12,318
Happiness may be a myth,
but unhappiness isn't.

858
01:01:12,927 --> 01:01:14,963
I don't give a fuck about you,
Skinny.

859
01:01:15,247 --> 01:01:19,001
He slept in a sitting position,
wrapped in a torpor of kerosene."

860
01:01:23,167 --> 01:01:25,078
Is that the version
Tusquets accepted?

861
01:01:25,847 --> 01:01:26,802
No.

862
01:01:28,647 --> 01:01:31,115
I asked for time
to do some rewriting.

863
01:01:31,567 --> 01:01:33,239
This is the final version.

864
01:01:34,447 --> 01:01:35,436
Was it worth it?

865
01:01:36,767 --> 01:01:39,486
- I'd have to read the whole thing.
- All right.

866
01:01:39,647 --> 01:01:40,966
As soon as Ana finishes it.

867
01:01:41,167 --> 01:01:43,727
Ana? Of course.

868
01:01:44,327 --> 01:01:47,364
Is that the part you're going
to read at the tribute?

869
01:01:49,327 --> 01:01:50,316
No.

870
01:01:51,447 --> 01:01:52,436
Yes.

871
01:01:52,647 --> 01:01:55,161
What happened to
that course in Jamaica?

872
01:01:56,439 --> 01:01:59,112
<i>If my lead is sharp
my tongue will feel it.</i>

873
01:01:59,279 --> 01:02:01,998
<i>And I'll write a thousand poems.</i>

874
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:10,716
Miriam...

875
01:02:12,839 --> 01:02:14,238
I left her.

876
01:02:14,879 --> 01:02:15,948
Shit!

877
01:02:16,679 --> 01:02:19,591
This is the last place
I thought I'd find you! Whore!

878
01:02:19,759 --> 01:02:21,477
I'm a friend, not a whore!

879
01:02:21,639 --> 01:02:24,915
Is there a woman in this film
you haven't slept with?

880
01:02:25,079 --> 01:02:25,955
Milly.

881
01:02:29,999 --> 01:02:31,751
What we need here is a man.

882
01:02:34,119 --> 01:02:35,313
Good evening.

883
01:02:36,679 --> 01:02:38,397
I'd like to live there,

884
01:02:38,599 --> 01:02:40,078
in that penthouse,

885
01:02:40,759 --> 01:02:42,556
with my child and a good man.

886
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:45,633
He's waiting for a chance
from you.

887
01:02:46,839 --> 01:02:48,431
I don't mean David.

888
01:02:49,519 --> 01:02:51,828
David is not good
and he's not a man.

889
01:02:52,279 --> 01:02:54,747
He's more of a man
than you think.

890
01:02:54,919 --> 01:02:56,352
What do you know about him?

891
01:02:56,519 --> 01:02:58,635
Do you know he was
kicked out of sports?

892
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:01,438
Not because he wasn't good
or because he was gay,

893
01:03:02,919 --> 01:03:05,956
but because he didn't
condemn a girl who defected.

894
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:09,437
He's a masseur because
all the doors closed on him.

895
01:03:09,799 --> 01:03:11,437
Do you know what a kind
of friend he is?

896
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:16,268
You heterosexuals don't have
a clue what a man is.

897
01:03:16,439 --> 01:03:19,033
Fuck off!
He cheated on me.

898
01:03:19,279 --> 01:03:20,837
Don't deny it.

899
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:23,190
If it were with a woman,

900
01:03:23,479 --> 01:03:25,390
you'd forgive him, right?

901
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:30,913
Now I wonder

902
01:03:31,079 --> 01:03:33,468
if you're good enough for him.

903
01:03:41,959 --> 01:03:44,712
- You smell so nice.
- Will we see each other again?

904
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:46,955
No.

905
01:03:49,639 --> 01:03:51,152
But you know what?

906
01:03:53,679 --> 01:03:56,876
I'd forgotten how nice it was
to be with a guy like you.

907
01:04:11,879 --> 01:04:13,790
May I have a glass of water?

908
01:04:14,679 --> 01:04:17,147
I'm so hungry
I don't know where I'll sleep.

909
01:04:23,239 --> 01:04:24,388
What happened?

910
01:04:27,079 --> 01:04:28,478
What happened?

911
01:04:32,359 --> 01:04:33,951
All right, all right.

912
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:43,468
Forgive me.

913
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:46,274
I'm still the same piece of shit.

914
01:04:47,759 --> 01:04:49,511
But I was crazy to see you.

915
01:05:19,079 --> 01:05:20,910
IN THE MOONLIGHT

916
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:47,274
This is...

917
01:05:47,639 --> 01:05:48,674
wonderful.

918
01:05:50,639 --> 01:05:51,833
Really?

919
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:02,070
- Know what?
- What?

920
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:05,948
I want you to go
with me to the tribute.

921
01:06:07,199 --> 01:06:09,269
I want everyone to see us.

922
01:06:15,079 --> 01:06:16,273
Damn it!

923
01:06:19,199 --> 01:06:20,268
Hello.

924
01:06:20,479 --> 01:06:21,707
Here?

925
01:06:22,719 --> 01:06:23,595
No.

926
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:27,189
It's your daughter
and she sounds...

927
01:06:27,679 --> 01:06:28,714
Look...

928
01:06:30,439 --> 01:06:32,794
To what do I owe the privilege?

929
01:06:35,519 --> 01:06:36,918
What happened?

930
01:06:39,399 --> 01:06:40,388
What?

931
01:06:43,759 --> 01:06:46,034
The fucking asshole.

932
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:48,789
That damned Manolo
dumped Milly

933
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:51,234
and now he says he wants
talk to me.

934
01:06:51,399 --> 01:06:53,867
He doesn't know
who he's dealing with.

935
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:57,792
Nobody shows contempt
for my girl. Nobody!

936
01:06:57,959 --> 01:06:59,438
I'll bust his head!

937
01:06:59,959 --> 01:07:02,189
The rebel inside me
is coming out.

938
01:07:02,359 --> 01:07:05,351
I'll kick his ass so hard

939
01:07:05,519 --> 01:07:08,079
he'll look like something out
of Goya's black period.

940
01:07:08,239 --> 01:07:09,558
And no tall tales from him.

941
01:07:09,719 --> 01:07:13,109
I'm almost sure she was a virgin
when he met her.

942
01:07:13,799 --> 01:07:15,517
He has to be responsible.

943
01:07:16,879 --> 01:07:18,392
Can you imagine?

944
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:20,277
What will Miriam say?

945
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:24,958
Don't worry, I'll call you
when it's all over.

946
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:26,234
Trust me.

947
01:07:29,439 --> 01:07:31,953
I hope you have a heart attack!

948
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:38,108
Manolo!

949
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:40,348
Hello, Julio.

950
01:07:41,239 --> 01:07:42,911
So you don't want
my daughter any more?

951
01:07:44,239 --> 01:07:46,070
So you're leaving alone?

952
01:07:47,159 --> 01:07:48,877
You're like all the others:

953
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:51,678
Fucking in Cuba with your
friend's daughters. Is that it?

954
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:53,431
No, no. It's not that.

955
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:54,918
It's not that.

956
01:07:55,319 --> 01:07:58,755
I'm staying in Cuba.
The firm has opened an office.

957
01:07:59,679 --> 01:08:02,830
We're going on vacation
to Viñales.

958
01:08:02,999 --> 01:08:05,797
After we talk to you first.

959
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:07,547
- We?
- Yes.

960
01:08:07,719 --> 01:08:08,708
You and who else?

961
01:08:10,839 --> 01:08:13,672
- Leaving her for some slut.
- Stop that, Julio.

962
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:17,032
What are you doing here?

963
01:08:18,639 --> 01:08:21,107
- No, no.
- Look, Julio...

964
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:23,474
Miriam, what the hell is this?

965
01:08:23,919 --> 01:08:25,671
We wanted to explain.

966
01:08:25,879 --> 01:08:27,597
It's hard, but...

967
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:29,477
we wanted to explain.

968
01:08:30,599 --> 01:08:32,988
I know shit when I see it
and you're shit.

969
01:08:33,159 --> 01:08:36,469
- And you're worse.
- Insult me if you like.

970
01:08:38,079 --> 01:08:39,307
But...

971
01:08:40,039 --> 01:08:41,233
things...

972
01:08:42,519 --> 01:08:43,952
things happen.

973
01:08:44,119 --> 01:08:45,188
This...

974
01:08:45,399 --> 01:08:46,878
this is love.

975
01:08:48,079 --> 01:08:51,515
Who do you think you are,
Marcelo Mastroianni?

976
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:54,869
I bet you don't have
a brother in Tusquets.

977
01:08:55,039 --> 01:08:57,109
You made it up to get my girl
and now my wife into bed.

978
01:08:57,279 --> 01:08:59,747
Rubbish! Of course I do!

979
01:08:59,919 --> 01:09:02,956
What's my brother
got to do with this?

980
01:09:07,239 --> 01:09:09,878
Stop it, Julio.
I was the one who proposed.

981
01:09:10,039 --> 01:09:10,835
What?

982
01:09:12,999 --> 01:09:14,512
Miriam, please.

983
01:09:15,079 --> 01:09:16,353
I can change.

984
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:18,635
I had a lover but...

985
01:09:19,599 --> 01:09:22,477
- Well, two...
- That's not important now.

986
01:09:23,079 --> 01:09:24,148
Know what?

987
01:09:24,519 --> 01:09:27,033
You and I have something
in common:

988
01:09:28,039 --> 01:09:31,588
We're only interested in women
when they spread their legs.

989
01:09:33,879 --> 01:09:36,347
Miriam, don't leave me.

990
01:09:37,239 --> 01:09:39,355
Think of the three
of us together forever.

991
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:43,228
- You can't ruin the sacred family.
- What doesn't exist can't be ruined.

992
01:09:43,399 --> 01:09:45,549
I was ready to stand
almost everything.

993
01:09:45,719 --> 01:09:47,869
Your selfishness,
your indolence,

994
01:09:48,079 --> 01:09:52,072
your gases when making love,
even your writing salsa hits!

995
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:55,673
I didn't tell her.

996
01:09:56,199 --> 01:10:00,192
Did you think I wouldn't notice?
Jesus!

997
01:10:02,839 --> 01:10:05,717
I was ready to play
the good wife,

998
01:10:05,879 --> 01:10:07,312
but I won't accept betrayal.

999
01:10:07,479 --> 01:10:10,676
What? You're stealing your
daughter's husband!

1000
01:10:11,359 --> 01:10:12,917
Milly won't forgive you.

1001
01:10:14,399 --> 01:10:15,388
Maybe.

1002
01:10:16,439 --> 01:10:18,669
But Milly doesn't love Manolo
and I do.

1003
01:10:19,999 --> 01:10:21,591
Things are now
as they should be.

1004
01:10:23,799 --> 01:10:25,198
What about your promise?

1005
01:10:25,479 --> 01:10:29,074
You said on film that
you'd never leave me.

1006
01:10:29,239 --> 01:10:31,434
That film doesn't exist now.

1007
01:10:31,599 --> 01:10:33,032
- Miriam...
- Get off me.

1008
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:34,791
Miriam... Shit, Miriam!

1009
01:10:34,959 --> 01:10:37,678
You can't go with him.
That swine is just like me.

1010
01:10:37,839 --> 01:10:38,908
That's why I'm going with him.

1011
01:10:39,159 --> 01:10:40,228
Come on, Manolo.

1012
01:11:00,559 --> 01:11:01,514
Hello.

1013
01:11:06,519 --> 01:11:09,636
This is my second novel,

1014
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:13,672
"In the Moonlight".

1015
01:11:42,039 --> 01:11:43,870
The show must go on.

1016
01:11:58,519 --> 01:11:59,110
Enjoy yourselves.

1017
01:12:00,519 --> 01:12:01,349
Enjoy yourselves.

1018
01:12:01,519 --> 01:12:03,953
See a star of Cuban literature cry.

1019
01:12:16,599 --> 01:12:17,918
If this man

1020
01:12:19,119 --> 01:12:22,350
is too modest to
sing his own praises,

1021
01:12:23,119 --> 01:12:24,154
I will.

1022
01:12:24,959 --> 01:12:28,429
Julio del Toro is one of the great
figures in Cuban music.

1023
01:12:28,599 --> 01:12:30,396
He is the author
of lyrics such as

1024
01:12:31,479 --> 01:12:33,037
"Sharpen My Pencil, Baby",

1025
01:12:35,159 --> 01:12:36,797
"The Fan Dance",

1026
01:12:37,959 --> 01:12:39,028
"Dead Letter"

1027
01:12:39,719 --> 01:12:41,277
and "Cassava Girl".

1028
01:12:42,039 --> 01:12:44,234
I'm proud to say

1029
01:12:44,639 --> 01:12:47,199
that thanks to his lyrics,

1030
01:12:47,599 --> 01:12:51,114
Heavy Sex

1031
01:12:52,079 --> 01:12:54,513
is going to the Grammys.
The Grammys!

1032
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:59,558
<i>I dreamt your love story
pulsating under the song.</i>

1033
01:13:00,639 --> 01:13:02,595
<i>Your name burnt my body.</i>

1034
01:13:02,839 --> 01:13:06,627
<i>I only want to see you again.
No fate gave me a carnation.</i>

1035
01:13:06,799 --> 01:13:09,757
<i>The sun dropped your love
on my skin under the rain.</i>

1036
01:13:09,919 --> 01:13:12,069
<i>I don't know how
to say goodbye,</i>

1037
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:14,355
<i>how can I explain the absence
of your smile.</i>

1038
01:13:14,519 --> 01:13:18,148
<i>I feel you have wings.
Your hands have</i>

1039
01:13:18,319 --> 01:13:20,230
<i>cured my wound.</i>

1040
01:13:21,999 --> 01:13:23,114
Congratulations, Julio.

1041
01:13:23,279 --> 01:13:25,747
I wasn't aware of this
wonderful ability of yours.

1042
01:13:30,679 --> 01:13:34,467
What's up, Julio?
What's wrong with him?

1043
01:13:34,639 --> 01:13:36,277
Somebody help us.

1044
01:13:43,839 --> 01:13:46,228
My name's Charlie Iznaga

1045
01:13:46,759 --> 01:13:47,714
No.

1046
01:13:48,679 --> 01:13:49,828
You don't exist.

1047
01:13:50,359 --> 01:13:51,428
Perhaps,

1048
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:54,313
but the contract for the first edition
of "Under the Moonlight"

1049
01:13:54,479 --> 01:13:57,039
by Tusquets Publishers
not only exists,

1050
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:58,837
but is dying for your signature.

1051
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:11,829
My brother is another thing,

1052
01:14:11,999 --> 01:14:14,672
but I appreciate him
sending us your novel.

1053
01:14:15,319 --> 01:14:16,547
Did you like it?

1054
01:14:16,839 --> 01:14:20,354
It has its ups and downs,
but it's fits the market now.

1055
01:14:21,359 --> 01:14:24,192
Do you know how famous
you are in Europe now?

1056
01:14:25,039 --> 01:14:28,793
Parts of the book are almost
as good as your songs.

1057
01:14:29,399 --> 01:14:32,835
<i>Sharpen my pencil
with your luscious sharpener.</i>

1058
01:14:33,239 --> 01:14:37,232
<i>- Lf my lead is sharp...
- Nurse!</i>

1059
01:14:44,199 --> 01:14:47,396
Thank you. We're not buying.
There are no kids here.

1060
01:14:49,559 --> 01:14:50,435
Come in.

1061
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:53,836
Thanks.

1062
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:08,995
- It says "Daddy".
- I'm not touching it.

1063
01:15:13,319 --> 01:15:14,468
What do you want?

1064
01:15:17,039 --> 01:15:18,791
- I've been thinking.
- Oh, yes?

1065
01:15:18,959 --> 01:15:19,630
Since when?

1066
01:15:20,639 --> 01:15:24,154
I want us to try again, Silvia.
That child is my life.

1067
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:25,638
Well, that child and you.

1068
01:15:25,959 --> 01:15:28,029
No, please don't interrupt.

1069
01:15:28,199 --> 01:15:30,155
No, I wasn't going to interrupt.

1070
01:15:30,559 --> 01:15:31,628
I was going to yawn.

1071
01:15:31,799 --> 01:15:34,438
Don't be cruel.
What do you want me to say?

1072
01:15:34,599 --> 01:15:36,032
Men make mistakes.

1073
01:15:36,199 --> 01:15:37,314
If you say so.

1074
01:15:38,319 --> 01:15:39,638
Diego was right.

1075
01:15:40,519 --> 01:15:43,317
- Deep down, you're all the same.
- Fuck you, David.

1076
01:15:43,479 --> 01:15:46,118
I'm no Messiah or saviour.

1077
01:15:47,239 --> 01:15:49,992
Do you want to be a husband?
A father?

1078
01:15:50,439 --> 01:15:52,191
- Yes.
- Very well.

1079
01:15:52,359 --> 01:15:53,758
But do you love me, David?

1080
01:15:55,239 --> 01:15:57,469
Do you want to be mine
and only mine?

1081
01:16:11,559 --> 01:16:12,435
Well...

1082
01:16:13,519 --> 01:16:15,157
the Flying Dutchman!

1083
01:16:15,719 --> 01:16:18,517
How's the Queen of Sheba?
Did she survive?

1084
01:16:19,279 --> 01:16:20,268
So did I.

1085
01:16:21,559 --> 01:16:23,675
- I want to talk to you.
- Come in.

1086
01:16:28,359 --> 01:16:28,996
Thank you.

1087
01:16:34,359 --> 01:16:35,678
I brought you flowers.

1088
01:16:36,759 --> 01:16:37,794
Thank you.

1089
01:16:39,919 --> 01:16:40,874
You were saying.

1090
01:16:44,959 --> 01:16:46,278
I want us to try again.

1091
01:16:47,399 --> 01:16:49,230
I'm not going back to you.

1092
01:16:50,839 --> 01:16:52,875
Julio, listen to me.

1093
01:16:53,559 --> 01:16:56,119
I'm not going back
to you or anyone.

1094
01:16:56,279 --> 01:16:58,349
People must pay
for their actions.

1095
01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:00,518
And for what they are.

1096
01:17:01,279 --> 01:17:02,598
I want to marry you.

1097
01:17:02,839 --> 01:17:05,069
- Are you feeling all right?
- I was sick...

1098
01:17:05,639 --> 01:17:10,030
but it's the best thing that
could have happened.

1099
01:17:10,639 --> 01:17:12,118
Now I see everything clearly.

1100
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:13,593
I need you more than ever.

1101
01:17:13,759 --> 01:17:14,748
Of course.

1102
01:17:15,399 --> 01:17:17,549
- The possessive thing.
- No,

1103
01:17:17,719 --> 01:17:19,152
I don't want to own you.

1104
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:22,318
I want to be yours
and nobody else's.

1105
01:17:22,919 --> 01:17:23,669
Do you understand?

1106
01:17:24,959 --> 01:17:26,358
I love you, Silvia.

1107
01:17:27,039 --> 01:17:28,472
I swear I love you.

1108
01:17:50,679 --> 01:17:51,634
Silvia,

1109
01:17:52,759 --> 01:17:53,748
was it that night?

1110
01:17:55,119 --> 01:17:55,869
Julio!

1111
01:17:56,519 --> 01:17:59,989
You'll see. I swear I'll fight
for all the time we lost.

1112
01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:02,389
I'm only interested
in you now.

1113
01:18:02,679 --> 01:18:04,397
In you and in my son.

1114
01:18:04,919 --> 01:18:07,387
- Sorry, our son...
- Julio...

1115
01:18:07,559 --> 01:18:08,674
Or daughter, whatever.

1116
01:18:09,999 --> 01:18:11,955
It's fantastic.

1117
01:18:18,039 --> 01:18:19,154
TWO YEARS LATER

1118
01:18:19,319 --> 01:18:22,311
<i>We've just received news
that the Juan Rulfo Award,</i>

1119
01:18:22,479 --> 01:18:24,913
<i>one of the most important
in Spanish letters,</i>

1120
01:18:25,079 --> 01:18:27,798
<i>has again been given
to a writer in our country.</i>

1121
01:18:27,959 --> 01:18:31,713
<i>Ana Roque de Escobar,
author of a disturbing monologue</i>

1122
01:18:31,879 --> 01:18:35,633
<i>questioning concepts like
happiness, love, commitment,</i>

1123
01:18:36,079 --> 01:18:37,637
<i>has said that "Signs on the Wall"</i>

1124
01:18:37,799 --> 01:18:40,154
<i>is her first story and is based on</i>

1125
01:18:40,319 --> 01:18:42,628
<i>her experiences as a reporter.</i>

1126
01:18:45,119 --> 01:18:46,598
The "orgasm" is almost ready.

1127
01:18:46,759 --> 01:18:49,398
Don't say that.
July will hear you.

1128
01:18:49,559 --> 01:18:50,912
Jesus...

1129
01:18:51,159 --> 01:18:54,993
If he knows what an orgasm is,
we should get a shrink.

1130
01:18:55,159 --> 01:18:57,832
Tell Daddy "I'm a brilliant boy

1131
01:18:57,999 --> 01:19:01,071
and I feel up all the girls
in the nursery".

1132
01:19:04,879 --> 01:19:06,551
- Want some help?
- No.

1133
01:19:06,879 --> 01:19:07,994
I'm done.

1134
01:19:08,919 --> 01:19:10,716
Milly is about to arrive
with her boyfriend

1135
01:19:10,879 --> 01:19:13,518
and I don't want you
cooking when they do.

1136
01:19:14,119 --> 01:19:15,313
By the way,

1137
01:19:15,759 --> 01:19:18,227
Milly is enjoying her job.

1138
01:19:18,639 --> 01:19:19,628
Oh, yes.

1139
01:19:19,799 --> 01:19:22,757
She says the commission
liked your project a lot.

1140
01:19:24,599 --> 01:19:26,430
It's my ideal building.

1141
01:19:27,119 --> 01:19:30,475
If she doesn't alter it,
it will cause a storm in Havana.

1142
01:19:30,639 --> 01:19:31,708
You'll see.

1143
01:19:33,039 --> 01:19:34,154
You see...

1144
01:19:34,879 --> 01:19:37,109
Life puts everyone in their place.

1145
01:19:38,999 --> 01:19:40,432
Milly graduated,

1146
01:19:40,599 --> 01:19:43,477
she has a Cuban boyfriend...
Here they are now.

1147
01:19:48,359 --> 01:19:50,111
- Daddy!
- My dear!

1148
01:19:50,439 --> 01:19:52,430
- You look pretty!
- Thank you.

1149
01:19:53,119 --> 01:19:54,188
My boyfriend.

1150
01:19:55,519 --> 01:19:56,634
I'm David.

1151
01:19:57,119 --> 01:19:59,235
Another David! I'm Julio.

1152
01:19:59,639 --> 01:20:02,711
This is your house.
Welcome to the del Toro family!

1153
01:20:02,959 --> 01:20:03,948
Thank you.

1154
01:20:04,959 --> 01:20:07,029
This is Silvia, my wife.

1155
01:20:11,119 --> 01:20:12,996
A pleasure, Milady.

1156
01:20:14,759 --> 01:20:15,987
Hey, come here.

1157
01:20:19,359 --> 01:20:19,996
Hi!

1158
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:22,277
He's so cute!

1159
01:20:23,039 --> 01:20:24,711
He's so big!

1160
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:28,157
Sorry, but he doesn't take to
strangers easily.

1161
01:20:28,319 --> 01:20:30,275
A stranger?
He's his brother-in-law.

1162
01:20:30,439 --> 01:20:32,191
And one that will
love him like a father.

1163
01:20:32,439 --> 01:20:33,872
Look, baby.

1164
01:20:34,559 --> 01:20:37,710
- See what we brought you.
- Oh, how nice!

1165
01:20:37,879 --> 01:20:40,109
Look, July, how pretty!

1166
01:20:40,959 --> 01:20:42,358
Thank you. It's very nice.

1167
01:20:42,519 --> 01:20:43,508
Shall we eat?

1168
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:45,271
Yes. You can't live on love alone.

1169
01:20:45,439 --> 01:20:48,795
Next week, Davy and I
will invite you for lunch.

1170
01:20:49,799 --> 01:20:52,029
- Is it real?
- Yes.

1171
01:20:53,239 --> 01:20:54,274
I'm sharp...

1172
01:20:54,799 --> 01:20:56,755
<i>Sharpen my pencil, baby...</i>

1173
01:20:56,919 --> 01:20:59,069
Dad, you won't recognize the house.

1174
01:20:59,239 --> 01:21:01,389
Davy's building a gym.

1175
01:21:01,559 --> 01:21:03,151
- A gym?
- Yes.
