Annie, sweetheart,
where've you been?

9
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,637
How come your boots
are wet with dew?

10
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,637
I was in the fields
scything grass, my darling.

11
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,628
No, we must sing Jadviga,
not Annie!

Ondris! Listen!

23
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,275
Heave a big sigh for my sake.

24
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,154
A real sigh of longing:

25
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,068
Jadviga!

26
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:32,151
- I can't wait for you to come!
- I'm going to meet her at noon.

27
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,397
- Help, I must rush!
- Noon's far away.

28
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,274
Farewell to bachelorhood
comes once in a lifetime!

29
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,758
She sowed beet, she sowed
poppies, she sowed juniper...

30
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,238
Her knees were white,
her cunt curly...

31
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,718
...he fondled her
chachurdyitshku!

32
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,308
What's that?

33
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,194
- He sat her down...
...na lavitshku!

34
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,074
- He fondled her...
...chachurdyitshku!

35
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,668
Haruhudyi...

36
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,238
Chachurdyitshku!

37
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,477
That's what you call it
in Slovak?

38
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,035
And how d'you call it in Jewish?
Like this?

39
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,277
Will you call it like that?

40
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,835
- Will you do this?
- To Jadviga's?

41
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,077
No, she's been brought up

42
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,954
by the English Frauleins
in Germany!

43
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,834
But Jadviga's coming home
to be a Slovak bride.

44
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,714
- Gregor! Wait for me! I'm off
to meet her! - Come on then.

45
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,275
I've brought everything.
Let's go home.

46
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,473
- Let's go up the tower!
- For pigeons' eggs.

47
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,597
This is wonderful!

48
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,630
He sat her down na lavitshku,
fondled her chachurdyitshku!

49
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,878
The egg, the egg!

50
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,754
- Ondris! Imitate the reverend!
- After the wedding, yes.

51
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,273
I beg you admonish
these profane ones!

52
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,868
Scandal.

53
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,035
Disgrace,
my brothers in Christ.

54
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,237
You drink till morning.

55
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,037
- Drunken pigs!
- Keep still!

56
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,428
The Lord will vent
his wrath on you!

57
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,634
I wash my hands of you!

58
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,838
They've arrived!

59
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,028
Jadviga!

60
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,317
God bless them!

61
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,868
Ondris! Come.

62
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,590
Captain!

63
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,594
Isn't he like my poor husband
at our wedding?

64
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,837
Were you at Apovka's wedding?

65
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,554
Tell me does that priest
of yours speak any Hungarian?

66
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,435
He speaks it,
but doesn't enjoy it...

67
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,558
Your Reverend!

68
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,397
- Szilagyi.
- Pleased to meet you.

69
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,628
I wish the groom's father
were alive!

70
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,115
I'd rather speak Hungarian
if you don't mind.

71
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,038
I knew him well.

72
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,158
How happy he'd have been
to see

73
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,715
his son and his ward united...

74
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,594
Was he the bride's guardian?

75
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,111
He had her raised in Germany!

76
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,194
- My friend must be very happy.
- He is.

77
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,118
Pali! Pali!

78
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,957
Enough!

79
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,197
Not that again!

80
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,788
A march!

81
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,038
Let the bride dance!

82
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,833
Dance with the Slovaks,
not just Jews...

83
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,395
A bit of drink and you're
Jew-bashing!

84
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,388
Ondris!

85
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,470
Dance with us, gorgeous!
For the last time!

86
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,398
I'll go over there.

87
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,795
Who's my friend?

88
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,388
Irmus!

89
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,838
- Are you happy?
- Yes.

90
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,678
I should hope so.

91
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,837
Just like his father.

92
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,714
But you're getting him young.

93
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,875
How he'll crush you in his arms!

94
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,315
He'll have more fire than
Apovka!

95
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,474
You've drunk.
Out of your mind!

96
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,551
So, here is the cake.

97
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,797
I hope you enjoy it.

98
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,233
Take my wife to dance.

99
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,708
No, I will.

100
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,833
Come on.

101
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,108
Jadviga!

102
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,550
I should have picked you up
and eloped with you.

103
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,148
You? Why?

104
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,037
That's the custom.

105
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,597
It doesn't matter.

106
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,148
I'll do it.

107
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,748
No peeping.

108
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,595
Slowly, slowly...

109
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,868
Ondrisko!

110
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,757
Let's get used to each other.

111
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,990
Be patient with me.

112
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,758
Ondrisko, not yet.

113
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,788
Easy.

114
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,148
Easy.

115
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,908
When I was a girl

116
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,157
I used to wish Apovka
would bring me here.

117
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,034
He brought you home once.
For your confirmation.

118
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,277
Take it out of my pocket.

119
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,278
The pine trees.

120
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,198
The churchyard.

121
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,033
I haven't seen them since.
Was it here?

122
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,233
- Don't you recognize it?
- I recognize you.

123
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,395
You were such
a sweet little noodle!

124
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,594
Always wanting to sit
on my lap and smell me.

125
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,837
As you are doing now?

126
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,674
I was afraid you'd go to
the Land of the English,

127
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,917
as an English Fraulein.

128
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,438
Land of the English!

129
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,317
I said you were a noodle.

130
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,875
A little Slovak noodle.

131
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,553
It's strange there's
no water here.

132
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,434
But there is...
The thermal water spring.

133
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,314
Or did you think
there was a sea here?

134
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,194
- No, I didn't. - The Sea
of the Hungarian Plain!

135
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,755
No, but I dreamt about Apovka.

136
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,271
And I looked for the sea
at the bottom of the garden.

137
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,553
I so regret I couldn't take
leave of Apovka.

138
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,871
I saw oleanders in flower
when he took me to Florence.

139
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,117
After my matriculation.

140
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,357
He took you to Italy?

141
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,553
It's a pity he didn't
bring you.

142
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,115
Anyway, I've got him
to thank for you.

143
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,313
Because he took me to you
in Stralsund that summer.

144
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,557
I was meant to visit Franci.

145
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,071
He promised
to take me to the girls!

146
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,668
Shame on you!

147
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,514
We must go to
my parents' grave too.

148
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,438
We'll go... Soon.

149
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,998
Someone will see us.

150
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,155
Aim at the window!

151
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,318
That's it.

152
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,748
Come on in. I found something
among father's old photos.

153
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,317
It's there on the shelf.

154
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,674
Gyorgy Osztatni - engagement.

155
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,517
I just can't work it out.

156
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,031
Your mother looks
so like Jadviga...

157
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,553
It's not my mother,
it's Jadviga's.

158
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,117
Were they really engaged?

159
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,668
And?

160
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,235
They broke up.
Hell knows why.

161
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,751
This Maria made a sudden
marriage to Endre Palkovits.

162
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,315
And Apovka married Mamovka.

163
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,194
Jadviga's parents died
when she was born.

164
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,437
Why? Was there an epidemic?

165
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,995
Some sort of wound
went septic.

166
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,555
- Her mother's?
- No her father's.

167
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,073
Her mother died of
puerperal fever apparently.

168
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,317
But a year after the birth.

169
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,194
So maybe it was a case
of caustic soda.

170
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,398
Please come here.

171
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,437
One, two, three...

172
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,910
Now!

173
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,148
Good morning!

174
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,038
What are you doing?

175
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,117
How can you behave like this?

176
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,997
How can you behave like this?

177
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,557
Dreadful! Scandalous!

178
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,797
Lieutenant, sir!

179
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,674
When does the train leave
for that dog Serbia?

180
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,673
I've just been given it...

181
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,237
I've invited you before.

182
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,795
Come to one of our meetings.

183
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,355
- You mean...
- You belong...

184
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,908
with us.

185
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,114
You're Slovaks, are you not?

186
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:13,598
You have a duty towards our
mother country.

187
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,073
We'll have our own country
when the war ends.

188
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,998
You mean... us Slovaks?

189
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,874
Because the Hungarians
snarl at us saying:

190
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,073
Stupid Slovaks!
Be prepared!

191
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,317
You mean us?
For what?

192
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:32,150
For what, for what?
We don't stay passive

193
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,308
once the Slovak State
has been founded.

194
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,831
We the Slovaks of the border
"outposts"

195
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,714
of the Great Plain.
You understand?

196
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,875
We'll have a meeting.
I'll send word.

197
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,437
But keep it dark.

198
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,115
What was all that about?

199
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,394
Ondrisko!
I haven't seen you for ages!

200
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,595
Because you've been avoiding us.

201
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,155
How come you weren't
at our wedding?

202
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,034
- I was away. Duty bound...
- Of course.

203
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,915
A troublesome inheritance case.

204
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,037
- But how are you?
- I'm all right.

205
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,674
Sprinkled all the girls?

206
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,518
You've lost weight.

207
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,357
You look a bit strained.

208
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,915
Don't worry about me,
I'm fine.

209
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:47,037
We were talking about
the old days in Stralsund.

210
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,517
That fine coast.

211
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,394
Jadviga often thinks of the sea.

212
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,911
Pity that your father
never took you with him.

213
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,750
But he did. He took me
to see Jadviga.

214
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,954
What did you grow
a moustache for?

215
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,197
A lawyer with a moustache.

216
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,315
- Thank you.
- I'll bring some more.

217
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,074
- Really delicious!
- I'm glad.

218
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,788
How did it happen? I haven't
even congratulated you.

219
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,671
So you want to produce
sausages...

220
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,917
After the war.

221
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,197
It'd be good to travel.

222
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,715
Are you going anywhere
this summer?

223
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,594
We're full of military
trains.

224
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,837
So I prefer to stay put.

225
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,475
Oh, no, I don't.

226
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,034
I'll just make the five o'clock.

227
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,548
I'm off.

228
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,718
- Dear Ondris!
- Bye.

229
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,197
I kiss your hand, Jadviga.

230
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,395
You're always hugging
that pillow.

231
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,797
My mother embroidered it.

232
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,317
I've slept on it ever since.

233
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,875
Then it knows more than I do.

234
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,188
Ondrisko!

235
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,037
It's not a good time!

236
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,231
- What have I done wrong?
- You haven't done anything.

237
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,077
It's all my fault.

238
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,748
What d'you mean?

239
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,118
I have to confess...

240
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,033
it's not the first time
for me.

241
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,308
What?

242
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,678
Don't spoil everything.

243
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,878
It's you, not me.

244
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,437
But I... not like that.

245
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,358
Not at all.

246
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,754
What is it you haven't
told me?

247
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,035
I once loved someone.

248
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,157
But he disappointed me.

249
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,597
He broke his word.

250
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,714
Broke his word?

251
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,628
What word?

252
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,508
Who was it?

253
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,108
D'you hear?

254
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,313
When was this?
Who was it?

255
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,875
- You misunderstand, I...
- Just tell me who it was!

256
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,148
At last!

257
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,948
At long last!

258
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,038
What have you done?

259
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,595
And just at full moon,

260
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,758
on the day of my trouble?

261
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,435
Please... don't be angry.

262
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,028
I'm sorry!

263
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,074
- I was completely mad.
- Yes, you were.

264
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,954
And I have to bear with it.
With everything.

265
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,548
Get up now.

266
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,355
You have to bear with
everything?

267
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,915
And all the things I do for you?

268
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,114
- Accusing and humiliating?
- I've said I'm sorry.

269
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,994
Aren't you sorry for what
you denied me?

270
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,830
Don't shout at me. I've had
enough... of the whole thing.

271
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,953
Are you threatening me?
Me, who adores you?

272
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,834
Like last night?
Like an animal?

273
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,675
I know I was wild.

274
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,150
But perhaps it's right that at
last... it's the natural thing.

275
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,234
In the stable.
It's natural there.

276
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,754
You can force your mares!

277
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,668
You peasant!

278
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,555
I appease you
and you degrade me!

279
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,797
You won't see me again

280
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,674
till you apologise to me.

281
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,637
Zelenak!
Get ready.

282
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,833
Go to the farm
for Mrs. Hulina!

283
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,988
Should I do everything? While
her ladyship mooches all day!

284
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:07,830
And makes a fool of my son.
Just as she did of his father.

285
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,551
His father would never have
behaved like his son.

286
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,711
And it wasn't me who made
a fool of Apovka.

287
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,755
All right, Breeze.

288
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,315
Easy, easy now.

289
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,395
- Leave it, I'll do it.
- Hold the horse.

290
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,597
Just like your father.

291
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,390
He once drove his horse
hard like this.

292
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,914
- What?
- Because of Jadviga's mother.

293
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,475
Why are you telling me this?

294
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,035
So you won't forget it.

295
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,437
Where you going?

296
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,028
Forgive me.

297
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,597
Don't say anything.

298
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,275
Why do they treat him
like that?

299
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,075
What is it?

300
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,917
Get away.
Get away from here.

301
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,158
Good Lord!

302
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,070
Come!

303
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,998
Come down! Come down!

304
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,118
It's Ondris's.

305
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,675
What have you been doing
again?

306
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,917
You're always up to something.

307
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,035
A call-up paper.
God Almighty.

308
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,914
Show me.
It's for the 21st.

309
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,397
How long's it been here?

310
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,318
Zelenak ate it.

311
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,793
- We'll write an appeal.
- Oh, darling... an appeal?

312
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,993
Or I'll get Irmus's husband
to send you to hospital.

313
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,874
How can I pretend before
a recruiting committee?

314
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,435
You won't go.
We'll tell them you're ill.

315
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,995
I'll be sent before
a court marshal.

316
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,517
Don't leave me now.

317
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,631
You said I should come
today, Captain.

318
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,558
What did I say?

319
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:48,071
Everyone has his duties.
I also have mine.

320
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,511
As I'm an independent farmer
we could perhaps refer to that.

321
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,757
- Can't I take a leak in peace?
- Sorry...

322
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:03,428
I don't know what I can do
for you. You've never been

323
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,951
a soldier. You can't get out
of reserve training.

324
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,515
Unless you're missing
an arm or leg.

325
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,075
But I see you've got everything.

326
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,273
- As a newly-wed should. - Yes,
and perhaps you can understand.

327
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,835
Understand I can.
But orders are orders.

328
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,148
Head up!

329
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,874
Ondris will be home
in a few weeks.

330
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,468
You'll see.

331
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,228
Oh, my God!

332
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,074
Should I go
and see that captain too?

333
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,274
The times he came here
to see you father!

334
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,791
- The times I've cooked for him!
- There's no point.

335
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,674
He'd have fixed it by now
if he'd wanted to.

336
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,268
Where are you going?

337
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,517
- Come and have lunch.
- I'm not hungry.

338
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,394
- I've fried some chicken.
- I'm back.

339
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,794
- Where have you been?
- I had to buy a few things.

340
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,951
I was waiting for lunch
with you.

341
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,834
- I wanted my last lunch
with you. - Ondris!

342
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:33,671
- I don't even know where
you go! - I was buying

343
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:37,510
pants, socks and tobacco
for you to take with you.

344
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,397
- I'm sorry.
- All right, let me go.

345
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,637
Say you're not angry.

346
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,151
I'm not, but put me down.
I'm tired.

347
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,555
Did you have it taken for me?

348
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,435
Keep it above your heart.

349
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,268
Here...

350
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,955
What can you say in Hungarian?

351
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,717
What are you chewing?

352
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,348
Baccy.

353
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,274
You could make some
kitchen cloths.

354
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,837
My eyesight's too poor.

355
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,598
It's lovely.

356
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,077
Don't take it so wide.

357
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,268
Mamovka!

358
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,828
What is it?

359
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,994
You remember my mother,
don't you?

360
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,475
Where did she live
when they were married?

361
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,717
In Nagy Street.

362
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,594
And what happened to
their things... when they died?

363
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,157
Who can remember that now?

364
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,717
Apovka gave me

365
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,594
some tablecloths and
bed-linen, but...

366
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,518
They didn't have anything.

367
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,075
Didn't my mother have
a mandolin?

368
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,988
A what?

369
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,188
Mandolin...

370
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,715
The furniture was sold.

371
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,957
You got the proceeds.

372
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,197
And more too, isn't that so?

373
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,395
Apovka gave me so much...

374
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,878
Tell me one thing.

375
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,354
Was it he who wanted you
to marry Ondris?

376
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:47,908
No...

377
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:49,828
by no means.

378
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:59,115
When you were married,

379
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,994
was my mother still alive?

380
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:05,513
Yes, she was.
Why, what did you think?

381
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,395
You weren't born yet either.

382
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,555
Why shouldn't she be alive?

383
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,434
She died two years later.

384
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,077
You want something?
Bark, bark!

385
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,837
Lick! Lick my hand!

386
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,714
- Jadviga, dearest.
- Dear Irmus.

387
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,915
- Can I stay with you?
- Come on in.

388
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,437
I don't know what to do.

389
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:15,273
- With your mother-in-law?
- I think she's gone mad.

390
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,115
I think she treated Apovka
in the same way.

391
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,994
Apovka certainly escaped
from her.

392
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,474
D'you know what he told me
after my matriculation?

393
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,068
In Florence...

394
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,835
That he was in love with
my mother.

395
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,957
And with you too, dear.

396
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:40,230
No,

397
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,117
it was rather me
in love with him.

398
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,911
I wanted the same thing from
him as my mother.

399
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,068
And he?

400
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,635
I don't know. Maybe
he didn't know himself.

401
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,877
He must have realized
by the end.

402
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:01,031
- He got scared...
- When? Before or after?

403
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:02,948
Oh, Irmus!

404
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,834
Maybe he still loved
my mother...

405
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,034
Or he may have felt it was
too late now with me...

406
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,877
Can you wash my back?

407
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,757
How are things with Franci?

408
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,593
After the way he treated me
in Stralsund...

409
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,397
I don't want to see him again.

410
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,558
He came at Easter.

411
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,115
Yet no one invited him...

412
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:41,675
- What did he want?
- What do you think?

413
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,795
- Are you having a bath?
- Can you undo me?

414
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:10,154
I'd happily dance with you...

415
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,037
We don't dance with anyone.

416
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,755
- Promise.
- I promise.

417
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,308
May I?

418
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,070
No.

419
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,718
Will you come home with me?

420
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,588
No, I won't.

421
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,108
Don't bark.

422
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,428
Ondris!

423
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,348
Oh, my God.

424
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:00,878
Oh my God!

425
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,068
Darling boy!

426
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,308
Come on in!

427
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,028
You're weary.

428
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,598
I'll heat some water...

429
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,111
- To wash in, and some food.
- No, thank you, I'm not hungry.

430
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:22,948
She's asleep.

431
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,517
Please don't do that!

432
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,757
Let me go!

433
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:32,548
Jadviga!

434
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,317
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

435
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,517
Nothing wrong?

436
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:00,075
I just missed you very,
very much.

437
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,794
- Take it out of the bag...
- What?

438
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,037
The little parcel.

439
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:48,074
So you're home, my boy?

440
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,593
I was about to come to
your office to say thank you.

441
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:55,111
- What the devil? - For your
help in getting me home...

442
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:59,917
I wouldn't admit it even if
I had got you home.

443
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:01,838
But, I thought that...

444
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:05,033
Don't talk out of turn. Only
at the right moment. Clear?

445
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,914
- Yes.
- Were they pleased at home?

446
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:11,113
Your wife got her due, eh?

447
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,628
So,

448
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:17,197
what's up in the village?

449
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:20,394
I haven't had time
to look around yet.

450
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,274
That priest of yours,
does he take care of you?

451
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,517
You mean of his congregation?

452
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:27,757
And the local Slovaks...

453
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,634
- Yes, everything properly.
- He keeps you together...

454
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,515
I don't know.
I was at the front.

455
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:37,031
Next time go and
mingle with them.

456
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,588
You mean...

457
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,115
Just as I say.

458
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,308
You mean me?

459
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,228
Why not?

460
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,158
Not my aunt in Shanghai!

461
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:53,034
Then you come to me
and we'll talk.

462
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,914
About what those great-big
Slovaks are up to...

463
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:59,113
Irmus isn't on very good
terms with her husband.

464
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:01,357
And if she wants me to...

465
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:05,190
I might stay the night and
come back in the morning.

466
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:19,911
- What shall I bring you?
- Yourself. Hurry home.

467
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:25,034
You're sweet to see me off.

468
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,275
Don't wait for it to leave.

469
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:42,513
Irmus's husband

470
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,753
has managed to get hold of
that nice office

471
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,997
for Franci Winkler...

472
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,157
as his lawyers office...

473
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:56,353
in the building where Irmus
lives in the main street.

474
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,555
They live in the same building?

475
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,713
I tried to get
a fountain pen for you...

476
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,957
Impossible to get it.

477
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,837
Things are so expensive!

478
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:12,033
I bought you the coloured
inks you like.

479
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,797
I'll go and take a bath.

480
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:46,275
Does the Foldes family
live here?

481
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:49,154
The doctor?
Third floor, no. 2.

482
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,078
They really live here?

483
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:53,948
Ondris!

484
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,794
You've come at a bad time,
my friend.

485
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,038
Were you coming to see me?

486
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,238
No... I just...

487
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:08,030
Your father dealt
with Apovka's will, and...

488
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,554
And now it's in my hands.

489
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,797
Any problems?

490
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,675
I was wondering about
the inheritance.

491
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:19,868
How come?

492
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:23,073
My father sent you the
certificate.

493
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:26,273
He was still alive then.
He sent it to all three of you.

494
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,791
- All three of us.
- Your mother, you and Jadviga.

495
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:31,390
Jadviga?

496
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,911
Of course.
She inherited half the fortune.

497
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,673
Jadviga? >From Apovka?

498
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,554
How did he know we'd marry?

499
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:47,708
He didn't leave it to his
daughter-in-law.

500
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,913
- But to his daughter.
- His adopted daughter.

501
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:56,034
That's right, pal.
Come on, walk with me.

502
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:00,193
Fancy your keeping that
secret from me!

503
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:01,788
What?

504
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:13,950
That inheritance thing. That
you inherit half the share.

505
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,435
You or me,
isn't it all the same?

506
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,278
And anyway...

507
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:25,154
It doesn't matter now.

508
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,637
I'm going to have a baby.

509
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:31,868
What?

510
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:35,708
What's that?

511
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,038
I'll have a son!

512
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:47,554
Or a daughter...
You'll have to love her too.

513
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,115
I'll have a girl,
a little girl.

514
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,038
Put me down.

515
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,188
Where is she?

516
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,915
What were you going to do
today?

517
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:05,475
Nothing but adore you
for this news.

518
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:07,717
This annunciation!

519
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:08,432
What's this nonsense about
"not long ago"?

520
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:13,154
And "a simple gathering
of friends"?

521
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:16,671
This is empty chat! I need
to know who the host was?

522
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,554
When, who was there
and what was said?

523
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,148
And what's this?

524
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:25,950
"The manifestation of honest
Slovak patriotism."

525
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,835
Who's going to believe that,
damn it?

526
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,395
What homeland are they
on about?

527
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:35,230
Not ours, for sure.
They're inciting to secession.

528
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:41,957
"Motherland"!
There's no country of Slovakia.

529
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:45,154
- They mean symbolically.
- Symbolically!

530
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,715
They want to annex
these areas

531
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,957
to the Slovak "motherland"?

532
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:51,878
I wouldn't think so.

533
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:55,073
There's a war on. Madmen!

534
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,517
And what about the deserters?

535
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,355
The Red revolutionaries?

536
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,793
The Jews posing
as social democrats?

537
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,994
There's your photographer
friend.

538
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:16,513
- He's one of them.
- No, no way.

539
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,758
No, no way.

540
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,870
I advise you to open
your eyes wide.

541
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:26,437
Am I understood?

542
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:35,068
We're not going home.

543
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,317
We're not going home.

544
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,513
We're not going home
till we're drunk...

545
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,077
Pretty girl.

546
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,317
We're not going home.

547
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,157
Miki, you drink too.

548
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:09,314
We're meeting on Tuesday,
at my place...

549
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,557
The reverend asks you...

550
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:14,434
- Or the captain...
- to come without fail.

551
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,317
I must make a note.

552
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,635
Honoured company!

553
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,118
My brethren!
We know that one day

554
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,631
the phoenix bird of the
Slovak soul will rise up.

555
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,475
My brothers
in the mother nation,

556
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:40,354
with which it is our greatest
desire to unite,

557
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:44,838
and whose suckling breast
is our dearest longing.

558
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:49,638
Sometimes I cannot fall
asleep without imagining

559
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,437
my arse pushed up against
the mother nation.

560
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,233
Priests, captains,
you can all lick it.

561
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,714
Many happy returns

562
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:09,474
to all Andrews!

563
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:16,515
Happy name day, Ondris!

564
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,077
Nak panboyshivi...

565
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:24,190
To your son, too.
Grow strong, baby Marci.

566
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:25,788
Wait!

567
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:28,674
That's it, we must have a photo
of the youngest Osztatni.

568
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:31,555
- With his mother.
- No, I don't want to.

569
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:33,468
Keep still!

570
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,597
I'd like to go to a spa.

571
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:48,837
For the medicinal waters.

572
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:51,068
Would you let me?

573
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:54,913
- A spa? But why? - I've
finished breast-feeding now...

574
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:59,068
The doctor recommends it.
To calm my nerves too.

575
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,635
So I can be like I was before.

576
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,228
Well,

577
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:06,753
- if it does you good...
- Dear person!

578
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:10,274
- How long will it be?
- Just a week.

579
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:12,828
Show me!

580
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,595
I didn't need to try them
before.

581
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:21,155
Come on, you're as
slim as a girl.

582
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:24,348
That's it!

583
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:26,590
Right...

584
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:34,918
- So... No?
- No.

585
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,158
Wait, I know!

586
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:40,353
The patterned one.
It's done me well too.

587
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:27,875
Are you still ticklish?

588
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:30,117
No...
You didn't do that.

589
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:33,635
How soon we forget...

590
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,195
- You know what I thought?
- What?

591
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:43,238
You little goose!

592
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,433
You didn't lose
your virginity, sad to say...

593
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,028
So cheeky!

594
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:51,554
Why did you send me away
from Stralsund that time?

595
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:55,708
- You know very well.
- I apologised a thousand times.

596
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,913
Engagements aren't usually
postponed by telegram!

597
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:02,113
- It was a force majeure.
- You were a force majeure.

598
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,313
The things you said about me.
I was told.

599
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:08,194
I was joking.
I hardly knew you then.

600
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:11,393
Yet you proposed to me
ten times a day.

601
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:14,911
My God! So that's why you
didn't marry me?

602
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,475
You weren't that serious
about it.

603
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,354
- I've waited three years
for this. - For what?

604
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:25,150
To be able to make love to you,
at last... in entirety.

605
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,438
It's beautiful.

606
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:52,995
You'll find someone
to love one day.

607
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,837
No, only if he comes home.

608
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,395
You heard he'd been killed.

609
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,594
You mourned him.
You'll forget him...

610
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,188
Never.

611
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,437
You never think about men?

612
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,794
She can only think of
her fiancé�.

613
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,994
Yet what she needs is
someone to love her.

614
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,357
It's your turn, Anci!

615
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:15,234
- I've no one to call.
- Yes, you have.

616
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:19,388
- But he died at the front.
- Try someone else.

617
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:20,670
Who?

618
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:23,554
I don't mind, if you don't.

619
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:26,438
You can call him...

620
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:28,997
my husband, Ondris.

621
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,237
God Almighty.

622
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,795
Enchant him for yourself.

623
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:36,674
Don't worry, you have
my permission.

624
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:38,598
You aren't against it?

625
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:07,395
- Like a glass?
- No, thank you.

626
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,108
Come.

627
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:33,638
Are we going away...

628
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:38,428
or are we not?

629
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,558
Let's get going.

630
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:48,993
There's just the evening train.
We'd get there at night.

631
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:52,193
I don't mind...
I'm not in the mood now.

632
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:57,954
- What's the matter?
- I don't like it here.

633
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:03,075
Or all this cigar smoke.

634
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:24,513
- Where are you going?
- To the other room.

635
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:31,553
Won't you sleep with me?
I've been looking forward to it.

636
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:35,071
So have I.
To sleep alone at last.

637
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:40,828
Get a divorce.

638
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:44,034
- Make a decision!
- Go to sleep.

639
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:58,758
Good night.

640
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:02,277
Mama's home.

641
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:04,508
Don't cry.

642
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:12,191
- Where on earth have you been?
- Don't torment me again.

643
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:15,393
- Aren't you tormenting me?
- Yes, I am.

644
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:21,154
- It can't go on like this.
- You're right.

645
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:24,998
Chase me away.

646
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,833
I just make everyone unhappy.

647
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:34,270
Why do I keep hearing that
I'm good and beautiful?

648
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:37,473
Yet I know,
even if I can't see you:

649
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,717
You reve when I'm away.

650
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:42,275
You tear at my clothes.
You stifle my pillow.

651
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:45,474
I swear I don't!
Not even in my thoughts.

652
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:48,035
And he keeps tormenting me...

653
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:50,595
to decide on a divorce.

654
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:54,438
Who are you talking about?

655
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:05,317
You must get rid of me.

656
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:08,518
I am damned.

657
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:14,273
I can't even take care of
my little boy.

658
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:22,670
Drink, because it quenches
sorrow as well.

659
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,873
I've just seen my old pal

660
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:28,435
- Franci Winkler!
- You're drunk.

661
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:31,958
I'm going to bed.

662
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,755
Don't wake me when you
come in.

663
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:42,197
You know what I'd like?

664
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:45,715
- I'd like her to sing to me.
- Who?

665
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:47,950
Who?

666
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:51,474
The one who should put
her arms round me

667
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:54,993
and sing to me:

668
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:58,194
"Beat me, beat me..."

669
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:01,075
D'you understand, Miki?

670
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:06,510
- Well, not exactly.
- Damn it all! What I want is...

671
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:11,310
I'd like her sing that lovely
comfort aria to me.

672
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:14,194
- She's not a singer.
- Let her be one!

673
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:18,037
Let her be one,

674
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,277
and sing once:

675
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:27,314
"Beat me,
beat me, good Masetto."

676
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,108
Right now!

677
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,995
- Don't you care that
we were seen? - No.

678
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:37,874
- I haven't got time now.
- I've got to talk to you.

679
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:40,754
- My clients are waiting.
- I don't care.

680
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:42,997
Are you crazy?
What's happened?

681
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,715
- What's the matter?
- Are you sick of me?

682
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:55,157
What's this you write to me?

683
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:57,397
What's this terrible letter?

684
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:00,915
It's another woman, isn't it?

685
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:04,753
Leave me alone.
I never question you.

686
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:08,594
Up till now I haven't cared...

687
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,715
about your affairs with women...

688
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:19,795
or your financial affairs...

689
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:22,997
or your affairs of honour...

690
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:26,835
I'm not interested in any
of them.

691
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:34,828
Only you.

692
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:39,315
But I must know one thing.

693
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:43,474
What this woman means to you.

694
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:46,354
- I want to know.
- Nothing.

695
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:57,553
And what do I mean to you?
What do I?

696
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:02,348
Everything.

697
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:12,270
Shall I tell you
why I must know?

698
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,477
Shall I tell you why?

699
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:18,348
Why?

700
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,477
Because I'm pregnant...

701
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:27,314
and I want to bear your child.

702
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:30,518
D'you want me to?

703
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,718
D'you want me to?

704
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:35,638
I do!

705
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,438
Don't worry,

706
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:31,317
we don't be a burden.

707
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:34,838
I'll stay at home.

708
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:45,388
And Ondris?

709
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,433
He's got a bigger soul
than we two put together.

710
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:01,312
How about those magic tricks?

711
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:05,874
How should I know?
Don't drink here as well.

712
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:14,510
Some sort of women's
sorcery, Gregor.

713
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:17,713
What kind of?
How they get lovers?

714
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:19,638
How do they?

715
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:23,791
They cut a little hair...
zo pitshki...

716
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:26,355
Do they?
From their cunts?

717
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,514
And they bake it in a scone.

718
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:33,075
And make us eat it.

719
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:34,988
Make you!

720
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:44,268
What are you doing?

721
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:50,353
Gregor!
What d'you know of my wife?

722
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,514
Not a lot, but enough.

723
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:57,395
What do you think of her?

724
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:01,234
You ask too many questions.

725
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,110
Why?

726
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:11,153
A man must be strong.

727
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:14,353
And resist evil
or it'll consume him.

728
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:17,234
Could you resist evil

729
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:21,388
when it came in the form
of a woman?

730
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:26,194
Had I not been careful
in the past,

731
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:30,673
I'd be where that wretched
Zelenak is now.

732
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:33,873
- My mother wanted you to?
- Let's leave that.

733
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:37,393
You brood too much.

734
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:41,871
You'll always be a peasant
for them.

735
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:45,075
Don't try to be a gentleman

736
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:46,998
by not working.

737
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,788
When I croak, who's going
to run this place?

738
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,637
You have a son.

739
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:58,834
I should do penance.
Flog myself...

740
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:00,758
Nonsense!

741
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:04,591
You should stay sober
and get down to work!

742
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:14,194
I'll be on duty till
Wednesday morning.

743
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:26,671
I get myself discharged,
while you...

744
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:30,193
It's war-time, there are
more and more wounded.

745
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:41,068
Well, then...

746
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:51,318
I'll be back.

747
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:52,910
Goodbye.

748
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:40,115
- Franci.
- Yes, darling.

749
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:45,550
- You're going on the afternoon
train, aren't you? - Yes.

750
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:48,434
I'd say come and see me
before you go,

751
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,677
but I've got a lunch.

752
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,917
I don't need lunch.

753
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:56,753
These are dull,
official people.

754
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:58,348
Of course.

755
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:02,191
Will Ondris meet the train?

756
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:05,068
Sure to.

757
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:09,868
Well then,

758
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:11,468
take care.

759
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:10,668
What's the matter?

760
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:15,478
It's moved!

761
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:40,108
Mother!

762
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,348
Mother!

763
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:58,513
I think we'll stay the night
with Irmus after all.

764
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:01,394
- Or with Franci.
- Can't you leave that!

765
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:04,274
If the train's late, we'll
see the doctor late too.

766
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,474
- There's nothing wrong with
Misu. - Stop grousing.

767
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:09,708
Bear.

768
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:13,553
Be good! I must show
Misu to the doctor.

769
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:16,753
If he's ill, he shouldn't
be dragged around.

770
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:32,757
Come on, this'll be the one.

771
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:34,988
Good day.

772
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:38,838
It really is here.

773
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:42,035
How did you manage it
in this turmoil?

774
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:44,277
Stop!

775
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:47,474
In the name
of the Council Republic!

776
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,833
- What is this?
- Communism. Let's go home.

777
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:06,670
- I'm not.
- Come on, Jadviga, I beg you.

778
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,514
- D'you hear? - Go if you want,
I'm catching the train.

779
01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:34,194
Hey, don't you
even notice us?

780
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:36,118
Put it on board.

781
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:38,675
Till someone breaks it again.

782
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:42,511
I said it was a drunken mob.

783
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:46,678
Come on!

784
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:50,191
These things always start
with the Jews.

785
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:52,755
Can't you give the Jewish
bit a miss?

786
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:55,637
The Entente's here now.

787
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:58,515
- If we play our cards right...
- Who's the "we"?

788
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:00,438
The Slovaks living here.

789
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:03,633
We should belong to the
Slovaks' state after all.

790
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,833
When we're 400 kilometres
from Bratislava?

791
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:09,714
When the Romanians are on
our doorstep? It's crazy!

792
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:13,550
Then we'll have our Slovak
autonomy under Romanian rule.

793
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:17,397
You idiots!

794
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:21,234
Won't Hungary do for you?

795
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:25,395
Not only do you want
to masturbate,

796
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:28,593
you need a sheep pen among
the Romanians as well.

797
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:31,474
Is nothing sacred for you?
Neither nation, nor good taste?

798
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:37,558
One can't expect
anything better from a Jew.

799
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:40,115
My dirty mouth,
is not because of my race.

800
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,994
If you smash my window,
do so because you're mad at me,

801
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:45,555
not because you can't stand
the Jews.

802
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:48,434
You're the one who has no
respect for other races.

803
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:51,951
For you Romanians belong in the
sheep pen, Slovaks are stupid.

804
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:55,153
You're not going to quarrel
over dirty politics I hope.

805
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:58,353
You dare to say which are
clean and dirty aims?

806
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:07,314
Do you see he's got
a birthmark?

807
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,877
Just where yours is.

808
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:15,315
Aren't his legs crooked?

809
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:18,194
What nonsense!
Why would they be crooked?

810
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:24,590
- Does Ondris like him?
- What's that suppose to mean?

811
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:26,508
Nothing...

812
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:30,033
I just thought
of my poor friend.

813
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:32,277
He's not your friend any longer.

814
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:35,791
- And I don't like you mentioning
him with pity. - I'm not.

815
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,588
Far from it...

816
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:43,798
I respect him.

817
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:48,273
It's good of him to care
so much for you all.

818
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:04,273
Why did you ask us to come
if you're not interested?

819
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:06,517
Because I missed you.

820
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:22,198
Leave me alone!

821
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:25,075
Leave me alone!

822
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:36,748
My brothers in Jesus Christ!

823
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:42,518
The edifice of the power

824
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:47,950
suppressing nations,

825
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:52,757
the Monarchy,
is getting rickety.

826
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:57,877
And from the dust and ashes
of this war

827
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:01,710
- the Phoenix bird...
- Phoenix, d'you hear?

828
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:05,231
...of the people's soul
will rise up.

829
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:10,674
Thus our hearts' desire
has been fulfilled.

830
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:14,191
The Slovaks of the Hungarian
Plain have found at last the

831
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:24,111
protector of their patriotism
and national welfare.

832
01:37:25,120 --> 01:37:34,995
In this solemn moment I declare
our accession to Romania!

833
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:40,758
- What has been fulfilled?
- We'll be Romania now.

834
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:44,908
Victory!

835
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:48,114
We'll be Romania.

836
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,917
Thank you, Mrs. Hulina.

837
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:09,235
What's the idea?

838
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:13,074
I didn't call Mrs. Hulina in
from the farm

839
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:16,273
to carry bath water for madam
during working hours.

840
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:19,791
So she can soak herself.
In broad daylight.

841
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:22,355
And I won't tolerate my maid

842
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:24,597
telling me that mlada

843
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:27,793
- ordered her to do this and that.
- Mamovka, please stop.

844
01:38:30,760 --> 01:38:32,955
I've spoken to that other maid.

845
01:38:33,320 --> 01:38:35,515
She's stronger than Anci.

846
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:39,035
Now that we have
two children...

847
01:38:40,360 --> 01:38:43,511
If you don't mind, darling,
let's send Anci away.

848
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:47,038
I don't mind.

849
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:02,078
What do you want?

850
01:39:06,280 --> 01:39:07,508
A gentleman...

851
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:10,714
spoke to me...
on the street...

852
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:13,918
What gentleman?

853
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:19,354
Well, him. The usual one.

854
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:22,548
Franci!

855
01:39:25,160 --> 01:39:26,718
What did he say?

856
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:30,551
That... he has to speak
to the lady of the house.

857
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:32,788
Is he here?

858
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:36,951
He'll wait at the ballroom
entrance if that's convenient.

859
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:43,358
Don't you want to go?

860
01:39:44,360 --> 01:39:46,555
What if it can't wait...

861
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:50,071
Can't wait! I'm always waiting.
Besides, we're having supper.

862
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:53,591
- Have you ever cooked for him?
- Oh, come on.

863
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:57,433
Of course,
he spoils you, right?

864
01:39:57,800 --> 01:39:59,358
Let's drop this, shall we?

865
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:07,038
I think I'll go to bed.

866
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:28,478
What shall I wear?

867
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:34,554
The grey or the one
with jasmine flowers?

868
01:40:40,040 --> 01:40:41,917
The jasmine flowers.

869
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:46,398
You're prettier in that.

870
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:54,597
Who else incited against
the Hungarians?

871
01:40:57,640 --> 01:40:59,517
Well, I'll tell you.

872
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:02,395
The host of that day's meeting.

873
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:05,274
- Who was the host that day?
- I don't know.

874
01:41:05,640 --> 01:41:07,835
You've told me once already,
damn it!

875
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:10,077
Pal Rosza, the teacher.

876
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:12,635
- But Pali didn't incite anyone.
- Didn't he?

877
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,195
Write: Rosza supported it.

878
01:41:15,560 --> 01:41:19,348
It says here that
on February 4, 1919

879
01:41:19,720 --> 01:41:23,838
you too were present at your
friend the photographer's.

880
01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:27,988
Where the notary met the
president of the Directorate.

881
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:30,555
But Szvetlik was only there
as notary

882
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:33,115
to discuss the flour
supply for the poor.

883
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:35,038
And they agreed.

884
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:39,191
Yes, on providing for
the war orphans.

885
01:41:39,560 --> 01:41:40,788
Right, then,

886
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:43,357
come on in.

887
01:41:45,320 --> 01:41:48,153
Write: In the course
of questioning Osztatni

888
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:51,990
it was proved that Szvetlik
cooperated with

889
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:57,753
the Communist Directorate
in planning the embezzlement.

890
01:41:58,120 --> 01:41:59,348
What's that?

891
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:03,513
Your witness is lying.

892
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:06,714
This has to be proved
at the trial too.

893
01:42:07,080 --> 01:42:09,275
I never accused you of that.

894
01:42:09,640 --> 01:42:11,517
Repeat your statement.

895
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:13,438
Tell him straight.

896
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:16,314
You'll be a witness at
the trial. You can'tjust...

897
01:42:16,680 --> 01:42:18,557
You go out and wait there.

898
01:42:22,120 --> 01:42:24,315
You're going to sign this.

899
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:26,875
I don't even remember...

900
01:42:27,240 --> 01:42:28,798
You don't remember?

901
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:33,268
Who sent me those reports?

902
01:42:34,280 --> 01:42:36,157
I won't sign anything.

903
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:38,397
You damn well will.

904
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:43,190
Do you want to break
your neck too?

905
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:46,388
I know...

906
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:52,474
That I've become a nobody.

907
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:56,633
After my wife,
in the eyes of my friends

908
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:05,913
and now in the eyes of
my wife's lover too.

909
01:43:06,280 --> 01:43:08,157
Ondris, please...

910
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:12,628
Why?

911
01:43:14,280 --> 01:43:16,475
I was a coward and an idiot.

912
01:43:18,440 --> 01:43:19,668
I'm a spy,

913
01:43:25,480 --> 01:43:27,675
a police informer!

914
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:40,477
I betrayed my friends.

915
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:42,398
Don't accuse yourself.

916
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:44,637
You were foolish at the trial,

917
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,195
but Franci will do all he can.

918
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:52,951
- You've gone back to him, true?
- That's not the point.

919
01:43:54,600 --> 01:43:56,477
But it's true, isn't it?

920
01:44:09,320 --> 01:44:10,230
Franci!

921
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:13,428
Oh, yes.

922
01:44:14,440 --> 01:44:16,317
He'll do all he can.

923
01:44:19,240 --> 01:44:21,435
But I'm a nobody.

924
01:44:31,720 --> 01:44:33,278
Nothing.

925
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:38,071
That's what I've become.
Because I've always been afraid.

926
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:42,234
I had no interest in work,

927
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:44,788
or land,

928
01:44:46,760 --> 01:44:47,988
or honour.

929
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:52,158
Just the fear of

930
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:56,311
- losing you. - Forgive me
if that's my fault.

931
01:44:56,680 --> 01:44:59,831
I've always been terrified
of losing you.

932
01:45:03,720 --> 01:45:05,597
But I've deserved it.

933
01:45:08,200 --> 01:45:10,077
My sins were plenty.

934
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:19,995
It's as if you were
my little boy now.

935
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:26,397
Or my brother.

936
01:46:01,960 --> 01:46:04,474
Sorry but... isn't he here?

937
01:46:05,160 --> 01:46:07,037
D'you know where Franci is?

938
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:10,553
- How should I?
- Can I wait for him here?

939
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:12,788
Dearest...

940
01:46:14,120 --> 01:46:16,315
- Am I disturbing you?
- Well, I'm...

941
01:46:17,320 --> 01:46:19,197
So you're sending me away.

942
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:26,558
Go back,

943
01:46:26,920 --> 01:46:29,434
and tell whoever's there
that it's all clear.

944
01:46:47,400 --> 01:46:49,595
Are you crazy?
Take him out of here.

945
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:52,793
I've come... because Breeze
is going to die tomorrow.

946
01:46:53,160 --> 01:46:55,355
He's going
to the slaughter-house.

947
01:46:59,240 --> 01:47:03,028
I want to order photos
from you.

948
01:47:04,680 --> 01:47:07,194
Please photograph my horse.

949
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:09,437
- Before he dies.
- Ondris,

950
01:47:10,760 --> 01:47:11,670
...no.

951
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:14,870
Take him out.

952
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:19,358
It doesn't matter.

953
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:28,314
I need a photo
of my wife too...

954
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:31,835
Though she wouldn't allow it.

955
01:47:33,160 --> 01:47:37,915
You know,
when she's making up.

956
01:47:38,920 --> 01:47:41,753
She never lets me watch.

957
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:46,878
Once I saw her, that's true.

958
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:50,068
Once...

959
01:48:06,120 --> 01:48:07,678
Come on, take a photo.

960
01:48:11,240 --> 01:48:13,117
Stop that, Miki.

961
01:48:13,480 --> 01:48:14,708
Sit down.

962
01:48:16,040 --> 01:48:17,598
Stop what you're doing.

963
01:48:18,920 --> 01:48:21,434
I said no. I'm working.

964
01:48:24,040 --> 01:48:25,598
Have you heard anything?

965
01:48:34,280 --> 01:48:36,157
Is there a verdict yet?

966
01:48:37,480 --> 01:48:40,313
Is it true Pista got
a suspended sentence?

967
01:48:40,680 --> 01:48:42,875
He can't be a notary any more.

968
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:47,034
He was accused
of embezzlement too.

969
01:48:47,720 --> 01:48:48,948
Unjustly.

970
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:52,795
Did you talk about me?

971
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:55,674
- That at the trial I...
- Yes, we did.

972
01:48:57,960 --> 01:48:59,518
He won't talk to me.

973
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:02,075
Nor will Pali Rosza.

974
01:49:03,080 --> 01:49:06,231
- Why not? - Pali's been
banished to Slovakia.

975
01:49:10,120 --> 01:49:12,315
You heard right.
The Slovak plotter

976
01:49:12,680 --> 01:49:16,798
should get out along with
his priest. Within a month.

977
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:19,355
How come you are so amazed?

978
01:49:19,720 --> 01:49:23,190
You signed the minutes,
didn't you?

979
01:49:24,200 --> 01:49:26,714
Let me tell you...

980
01:49:27,080 --> 01:49:28,957
I'd rather you didn't.

981
01:49:29,320 --> 01:49:30,878
One day...

982
01:49:31,560 --> 01:49:33,118
we'll talk about it

983
01:49:35,080 --> 01:49:36,308
perhaps...

984
01:49:38,920 --> 01:49:41,434
And you should
photograph this too.

985
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:45,595
That the cliff is high,

986
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:49,437
the water deep.

987
01:49:51,080 --> 01:49:52,308
But

988
01:49:54,920 --> 01:49:57,115
there's no high cliff

989
01:49:58,440 --> 01:50:00,954
nor deep water around here,

990
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:05,115
I'm afraid.

991
01:50:24,360 --> 01:50:26,237
Miso! Miska!

992
01:50:49,320 --> 01:50:51,515
Are you afraid of witches?

993
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:10,077
What are you doing, Marci?

994
01:51:10,440 --> 01:51:11,998
Out you go.

995
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:19,034
Stay with her.
I'll get the doctor.

996
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:22,078
Here's Papa!

997
01:52:24,360 --> 01:52:26,555
So... here you are.

998
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:29,110
Yes.

999
01:52:29,800 --> 01:52:32,314
- What news at the farm?
- Nothing.

1000
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:34,877
Let's go, boys.

1001
01:52:38,120 --> 01:52:39,997
Where did you get
that hat from?

1002
01:52:40,680 --> 01:52:42,238
Just a hat.

1003
01:52:43,240 --> 01:52:45,117
It's Apovka's isn't it?

1004
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,195
You look like him in it.

1005
01:52:58,280 --> 01:52:59,838
Off we go.

1006
01:53:13,160 --> 01:53:15,355
There's Uncle Franci.

1007
01:53:28,520 --> 01:53:29,748
To your health!

1008
01:53:30,760 --> 01:53:33,274
Why aren't you drinking,
Franci?

1009
01:53:46,120 --> 01:53:47,348
Champagne.

1010
01:53:48,680 --> 01:53:50,557
They're drinking champagne.

1011
01:53:51,880 --> 01:53:53,757
Champagne aria.

1012
01:53:55,400 --> 01:53:57,595
D'you know who Mozart is?

1013
01:53:57,960 --> 01:54:00,155
D'you know who that child is?

1014
01:54:00,520 --> 01:54:02,397
Do you know?

1015
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:13,908
Ondris!

1016
01:54:14,600 --> 01:54:15,828
Ondris!

1017
01:54:26,120 --> 01:54:27,348
Ondris!

1018
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:34,710
No...

1019
01:54:49,160 --> 01:54:50,718
Not fighting.

1020
01:55:22,120 --> 01:55:23,678
Don't you recognize me?

1021
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:29,755
Yet I was introduced to you.

1022
01:55:32,680 --> 01:55:33,908
Right here.

1023
01:55:39,720 --> 01:55:42,553
You at least should talk
to me a bit.

1024
01:55:51,560 --> 01:55:54,393
All I know
is that I'm a monster.

1025
01:55:59,880 --> 01:56:01,757
What do you know about me?

1026
01:56:03,400 --> 01:56:04,628
Can you hear?

1027
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:08,788
Answer me!

1028
01:56:14,280 --> 01:56:16,794
Talk to me just this once.

1029
01:56:20,680 --> 01:56:23,194
I ask you for the last time.

1030
01:57:36,200 --> 01:57:37,428
Your hand.

1031
01:57:38,120 --> 01:57:39,678
Gently, gently.

1032
01:57:51,560 --> 01:57:53,437
What happened?

1033
01:57:54,760 --> 01:57:56,637
The doctor will be here soon.

1034
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:58,558
What happened to him?

1035
01:57:58,920 --> 01:58:00,478
He has spasms.

1036
01:58:01,160 --> 01:58:02,718
What kind of spasms?

1037
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:14,228
Gregor!

1038
01:58:20,360 --> 01:58:21,918
Where does it hurt?

1039
01:58:22,280 --> 01:58:23,508
Here?

1040
01:58:39,560 --> 01:58:41,118
Am I at home?

1041
01:58:41,800 --> 01:58:43,028
Yes, my darling.

1042
01:58:44,360 --> 01:58:46,874
Yes, my darling.
At home...

1043
01:58:48,840 --> 01:58:50,398
on my pillow.

1044
01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:52,955
I'm not going away.

1045
01:58:53,640 --> 01:58:55,517
I'm staying here with you.

1046
01:58:58,760 --> 01:58:59,988
Mama...

1047
01:59:01,640 --> 01:59:02,868
Your hand!

1048
01:59:11,880 --> 01:59:13,438
I'm afraid.

1049
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:26,877
Very afraid.

1050
01:59:42,600 --> 01:59:44,158
Let's sleep.

1051
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:10,715
Ondrisko!

1052
02:00:28,040 --> 02:00:29,598
My Ondrisko!

1053
02:01:10,600 --> 02:01:12,795
I want to be alone with him.

1054
02:01:38,760 --> 02:01:41,593
Our Father,
who art in heaven...

1055
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:16,470
You had to suffer so much,

1056
02:02:20,040 --> 02:02:21,598
my son!

1057
02:02:47,240 --> 02:02:48,468
Uncle Gregor,

1058
02:02:49,800 --> 02:02:52,951
could you post this letter
on your way?

1059
02:02:55,240 --> 02:02:57,117
I've finished now.

1060
02:02:59,080 --> 02:03:00,308
Right.

1061
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:05,755
So when can we talk
about what needs to be done?

1062
02:03:06,120 --> 02:03:07,678
Never again.

1063
02:03:08,680 --> 02:03:10,557
What d'you mean, never?

1064
02:03:11,240 --> 02:03:12,798
I've had enough.

1065
02:03:19,240 --> 02:03:21,435
I must give this to you.

1066
02:03:33,320 --> 02:03:34,548
Goodbye.

1067
02:03:59,880 --> 02:04:04,317
I, Andras Osztatni

1068
02:04:05,960 --> 02:04:12,638
am starting this notebook

1069
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,514
on February 5, 1915,

1070
02:04:17,160 --> 02:04:19,993
the day before my marriage.

1071
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,833
Hot and flushed with excitement,

1072
02:04:24,200 --> 02:04:27,033
sleep won't come
to my eyes.

1073
02:04:27,400 --> 02:04:30,233
So I've taken this notebook out
already,

1074
02:04:30,920 --> 02:04:32,797
because I've decided

1075
02:04:33,160 --> 02:04:36,948
to keep a diary from now on

1076
02:04:37,320 --> 02:04:39,515
seeing I'll be a married man.

1077
02:04:40,200 --> 02:04:43,351
At this moment midnight is
chiming

1078
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,195
so I may write that

1079
02:04:47,560 --> 02:04:49,755
today,

1080
02:04:50,120 --> 02:04:52,634
February 6, 1915

1081
02:04:53,640 --> 02:05:00,955
I can at last lead Jadviga
Maria Palkovits to the altar.

1082
02:05:03,240 --> 02:05:09,588
I thank the Lord that
I lived to see this day.
