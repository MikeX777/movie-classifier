1
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,070
We ask whoever took our Emily..

2
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,840
...please remember
she's someone's child.

3
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,080
We come to you with an exclusive
this morning as new breaks

4
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,850
that a three-year old girl
was abducted from her home

5
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,490
in Copeland County
late last night.

6
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,020
Investigators say that the young
girl was asleep in her room

7
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,490
<i> when an assailant</i>
<i> forcefully entered her home</i>

8
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,890
and abducted her.

9
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,990
An amber alert
was issued this morning

10
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,600
as the unidentified suspect
is still at large

11
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,700
and potentially dangerous.

12
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,600
If you have any information..

13
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,250
Any little girl
dreaming of being a ballerina

14
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,250
loves our dresses made of tulle.

15
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,720
But...satin dresses
are pretty popular

16
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:47,290
with the budding princesses,
but my personal favorite

17
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,330
is the tulle dress
paired with sneakers.

18
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,400
And, um, these just, 
pull the look altogether.

19
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,210
Makes you wish
you were five again, right?

20
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,710
Um, I'll go
wrap this up for you.

21
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,880
I think I even have a hair bow
to match. Be right back.

22
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,520
- Hi.
- I'm working.

23
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,220
- So am I.
- No, you're distracting.

24
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,390
- Okay, I was working.
- Well, go, continue.

25
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,890
But I need your approval
before I can keep going.

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,560
Excuse me?

27
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,900
I'm just gonna
wrap this up in the back

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,960
where I have
the tissue paper, okay?

29
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,470
- What do you think?
- Ryan..

30
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,910
Yeah?

31
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,650
I mean,
whoever we sell this to is--

32
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,450
Maybe we don't sell it.

33
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,850
We have a store
for selling things.

34
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,350
Maybe just put it
in the store window

35
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,520
but don't sell it.

36
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,350
You stop right there.

37
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,290
Or maybe I don't

38
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,490
and then you'll be so glad that
I had this thing ready to go.

39
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,960
We're not ready.

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,860
- We're ready.
- We're almost ready.

41
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,670
How much longer?

42
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,610
When it's time.

43
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,310
But right now I have a customer.

44
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,610
She's fine.

45
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,880
We cannot behave this way
at work.

46
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,610
- Says who?
- Your boss.

47
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,140
And then he calculated
what each of us owed on the tab

48
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,340
down to the cent.

49
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,810
- Boy.
- Yeah.

50
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,080
And then I had one spring roll

51
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,510
and he divided a quarter
of the price of the rolls

52
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,820
and added it
to my part of the tab.

53
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,580
I mean, no wonder
he's still single.

54
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,490
I-I threw down my cash
and I wished him luck.

55
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,720
I mean, can you imagine
traveling with this man?

56
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,760
- I feel sorry for him.
- I-I-I know.

57
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,560
I mean,
he's completely clueless.

58
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,030
Well, get back out there.
You're gonna find someone.

59
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,000
Between work and school,
I-I'm literally exhausted.

60
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,200
Well, a couple of more tests
and you're gonna be a nurse.

61
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,240
Yeah, it's that easy.

62
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,270
Of course not,
but then we can get back

63
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,740
to brunches and game nights.

64
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,840
So you can slaughter me
at trivia?

65
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,750
I'll take you anywhere
I can get you.

66
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,010
'Cause I'm your favorite.

67
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,750
- Thank you.
- Thanks, honey.

68
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:37,230
But, um, Karina, you do need
to find another brunch buddy.

69
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,590
- Don't say that.
- Seriously.

70
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,760
I mean, you came out here
to get the shop going

71
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,530
and to start a family.

72
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,700
Shop is doing great
and the family thing is

73
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,570
well, well, as you say,
in the works.

74
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,910
So it's time, right?

75
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,110
I-it's time to find
a local lady-friend

76
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,380
to have some fun with
between our visits.

77
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,210
- Are you breaking up with me?
- Well..

78
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,850
I am actually seeing someone.

79
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,620
He looks an awful lot
like a text book.

80
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:07,220
- Stop.
- Babe, I love you.

81
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,690
I don't mind sharing you.

82
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,890
You put so much of yourself
into that shop

83
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,530
I-I just want you to enjoy
this life that you have here.

84
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,260
I just don't know anyone
out here.

85
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,270
You know, it's not
as easy to meet people

86
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,270
as it was in college.

87
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,940
It's not like I work
in an office. So what do I do?

88
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:27,310
Well, next time a nice
customer comes into the shop

89
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,680
ask her to lunch. Start there.

90
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,080
Okay.

91
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,780
But if she brings out
a spreadsheet

92
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,080
to calculate the tab?

93
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,320
- Run!
- Yeah.

94
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,050
As fast as you can, okay?

95
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,790
- I'll drink to that.
- A drink to that.

96
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,400
Hello there.

97
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,970
Hey, sorry,
I kinda got in the zone.

98
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,610
You have been for hours.

99
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:01,840
Here's your half of the snack

100
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,610
you were supposed
to join me for.

101
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,350
Whoops.

102
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,480
- You want some company?
- Sure.

103
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:15,760
So, I thought
we closed the shop on Sundays

104
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,360
so you could have a day off.

105
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,530
When inspiration strikes..

106
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,030
How is Cam?

107
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,070
She's good, you know

108
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,300
she's very close to making

109
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,770
all her dreams come true.

110
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:31,510
She just never comes up
for air, you know?

111
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,340
I know someone else
we could say that about.

112
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,580
- The business is doing great.
- I know.

113
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,980
You can start enjoying the life
that we've built here.

114
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,190
I know.

115
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,020
And I'm not trying
to pressure you.

116
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,490
I know.

117
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,690
I wanna build a family, too.

118
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,900
But I just had this idea

119
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,930
that when we raise a family,
we'll be in a community.

120
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:01,870
And every time I see Cam,
it becomes very apparent.

121
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:05,270
- That's not what we have here.
- Yet.

122
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,610
That's what we need
to start building.

123
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,580
Not more stuff.

124
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,120
Ooh.

125
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,820
You're right.

126
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,950
I'm right.

127
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:26,860
Just let me finish the hem.
Please.

128
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,700
Thanks.

129
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,830
Alright, Master Hemster

130
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,330
show me how this is done.

131
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,070
Well, watch
'cause I'm really good at this.

132
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,380
<i> In this week on special report</i>

133
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,880
<i> we begin in Copeland County,</i>
<i> California.</i>

134
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,620
<i> Sleeping safely in her bed</i>

135
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:52,990
was a normal and curious
three-year old girl.

136
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,690
Then an unidentified assailant
kidnapped the child.

137
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,490
<i> Now, five years later</i>

138
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:01,430
<i> investigators officially</i>
<i> put an end to their search</i>

139
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,330
declaring her dead in absentia.

140
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:08,270
Tonight, we bring you
this story and others like it

141
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,170
in CBN-7's special report
on child abduction cases

142
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:14,380
that have run cold
in California.

143
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:10,200
Are the dresses for people, too?

144
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,570
- The dresses?
- Or just for fairies?

145
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,570
Let's see, shall we?

146
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,080
Excuse me, Mr. Hippo.

147
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,510
- This little girl--
- 'Mallie.'

148
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,180
Mallie would like to know

149
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:30,150
if she can borrow
the fairies' dresses.

150
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,690
The Hippo said
the fairies would be honored

151
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,660
to share their dresses with you.

152
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,160
- I read the most books--
- 'Mallie!'

153
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,830
You can't take off like that.

154
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,400
Mallie, what did I just say?

155
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,230
Mom, look.

156
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,870
Honey..

157
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,200
...you are
my most precious thing, okay?

158
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,970
I don't know
what I would do without you.

159
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:54,410
Sometimes I'm just so fast,
I can't control myself.

160
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,880
I understand, honey.

161
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,050
I bet, and you're fast
at reading, too.

162
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,720
I get a medal
in front of everyone!

163
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,520
So this dress
is for a celebration?

164
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,420
Honey, remember,
we-we're not doing the ceremony.

165
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,720
- Just the dress.
- I've never gotten a medal.

166
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,190
You're going to get the medal,
okay?

167
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,100
Her school is honoring the most
avid readers in each grade, so..

168
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,430
How exciting!

169
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,800
I mean, I don't,
I don't love the idea

170
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,470
of my daughter being paraded in
front of a bunch of strangers.

171
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,710
But, you know,
you hear all of these things

172
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,210
that go on these days and it's..

173
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,980
- 'Yes, of course.'
- Yes.

174
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,980
Well, how about..

175
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,450
...you try it on?

176
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,050
Okay.

177
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,220
- She's so cute.
- Thank you.

178
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,090
I'm sure I-I sound crazy.

179
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,330
It's just you hear
these stories these days.

180
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,060
And I, I mean, I don't mean
to be over-protective

181
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,600
but she's, she's literally
all I have, so it's..

182
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,500
Of course, you know,
I can't even imagine

183
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:54,270
what it's like to parent these
days with all the technology--

184
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,410
It's crazy, they're exposed
to the world like that. It's..

185
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:01,280
Well, good for you for keeping
such a close eye on her.

186
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,080
Thanks, I try.

187
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,810
How about you?
Do you have any kids?

188
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,650
Not yet.

189
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,180
- Not yet.
- Yeah.

190
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,980
But you-you work here?

191
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,650
I own here, actually.

192
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,420
- Well, good for you.
- Yeah.

193
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,990
Little bit of advice
for when you do have kids.

194
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,690
What they say is true,
it takes a village

195
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,790
which is something
I do not have.

196
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:22,660
- It doesn't fit.
- Aw, honey.

197
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,330
We'll find you something else.

198
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,170
How about I make you a dress?

199
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,070
But who made this dress?

200
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:30,640
Fairies or you?

201
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:33,370
Well, I make the dresses
for the fairies

202
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,280
and I can make a special one
for you.

203
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,440
'You don't have to do that.'

204
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,750
Nonsense.

205
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,810
Come on, let's go
get you measured.

206
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,470
So I'll see you
for dinner, instead.

207
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,240
This is more beautiful than
my mind could ever think of.

208
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,140
We, 
we can't thank you enough.

209
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,010
You're nice people.
It was my pleasure.

210
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,680
Sweetie, go get dressed
'cause I've to get

211
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,410
to the post office
before it closes, okay?

212
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:49,080
But I never wanna take this off.

213
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,190
I can watch her
while you head over.

214
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,220
- Are you sure?
- It's no problem at all.

215
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,720
Okay, I'll be real quick.

216
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,860
Be dressed and ready
when I get back, okay, honey?

217
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,230
Thank you.

218
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,200
Mallie, I have to help
this customer

219
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,560
right here for just a sec.

220
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,230
But over there
there's a book shelf.

221
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,900
You can read any book
that you want to.

222
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,040
Okay? I'll be right with you.

223
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,970
- Hi, how are you?
- Hi, how are you doing?

224
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:14,040
Great. Um, are you interested
in this crib?

225
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,780
'Yes, I am. I'm very interested
in this crib.'

226
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:18,510
'Well, my husband designs
all the cribs.'

227
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,050
'He does all the woodwork
himself'

228
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,580
'and it's kinda supposed
to be reminiscent of'

229
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,720
what you would have played with
at your grandparents' house

230
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,790
when you were young.

231
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,620
'Awesome.'

232
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,060
Um, and he also designed
the dresser to match

233
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,330
so it's kind of a set..

234
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,460
It's trending
with all the hipster parents.

235
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,130
Mallie, stop!

236
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,900
Hey! Hey!

237
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,850
Honey, sit down,
just read a book right there.

238
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:04,090
Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

239
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,660
Hey.

240
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,330
- What's going on?
- We need to call the police.

241
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,330
Why?

242
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,570
A man,
he-he tried to take Mallie.

243
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,770
I think, I'm-I'm assuming
that it wasn't her father.

244
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,610
'No, her father's
not in the picture.'

245
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:21,810
Okay. If I hadn't stopped him,
he just, he would've taken her.

246
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,750
You did, okay?

247
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:27,450
You came to the rescue,
so don't, don't call the police.

248
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,950
A man tried to kidnap
your daughter

249
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,180
and you don't wanna
call the police?

250
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,750
I don't wanna alarm her.

251
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:36,490
Can you imagine a little girl,
her age, talking to the cops?

252
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,690
They're not exactly good
with kids.

253
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,960
How can you be so calm?

254
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,160
It's just, children pick up

255
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,500
on a lot more than they let on

256
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:46,870
and I just..

257
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,470
Please, I-I, I don't wanna

258
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:50,140
make her feel unsafe.

259
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,710
You understand?

260
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,340
Please, I-I..

261
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,510
I'm so sorry,
it happened so quick and I--

262
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:00,810
Honey, you did, you did great.

263
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,820
Really, you're a..

264
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,450
You're a godsend,
I mean, I don't..

265
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:09,560
My God. How am I ever
going to repay you.

266
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:12,790
Actually, I could start
by-by paying you, I mean..

267
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,260
- Here. Please take, take extra.
- No, no, no.

268
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,330
It's okay, it's okay. Um..

269
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:23,570
I don't know, maybe we could
go out for a-a bite sometime

270
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,240
you know, I don't know
very many people around here.

271
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,510
Honey,
a bite would be great.

272
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,640
- Okay.
- On me, okay?

273
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,040
- Okay?
- We'll see.

274
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,350
- On me!
- Okay.

275
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,750
Thank you.

276
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:47,830
Just keep thinking I should've
reported the incident today.

277
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:51,230
I mean,
what, what if it happens again?

278
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,970
Well, you definitely should
let people know

279
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,740
but you got to respect
her privacy.

280
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:00,980
Yeah, but what happens if he
succeeds next time? Then what?

281
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:04,410
That's why we all
have to exercise caution.

282
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:07,250
How, when she won't report it?

283
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:10,150
Maybe she doesn't wanna
scare her daughter.

284
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,290
Yeah, but what about
other people's children?

285
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:18,290
I bet you spooked him.

286
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:21,760
- He won't be back.
- I hope you're right.

287
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,430
Turn that brain off.

288
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,610
- Go to sleep.
- Okay.

289
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,440
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

290
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,290
- I am so glad that we did this.
- Yeah.

291
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,290
I just, I don't tend
to get out on my own.

292
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,290
Well, the life of a single
mother must not be easy.

293
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,460
I know that I'm not
the only one in town

294
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,200
but it really feels like it
sometimes.

295
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,300
- You know?
- Yeah.

296
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,300
Does your ex help out at all?

297
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,670
He..

298
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:11,350
I prefer to keep anything
involving him in the past.

299
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,080
I mean,
Mallie and I moving here

300
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,520
was really about a fresh start

301
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,820
you know,
so it's important for me to--

302
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,250
Yeah, I--

303
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,390
Lena! Congrats are in order.

304
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,560
Dylan told me that Mallie won
the Eager Reader Award.

305
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:26,490
- Hey. Thank you.
- I'm not surprised.

306
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,260
Hi. I don't know you, I'm Emma.

307
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,000
Hi, I'm Karina.
Nice to meet you.

308
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,230
Our kids share a teacher.

309
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,900
And thank goodness
it's Mallie, too.

310
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,940
I mean, Dylan could never.
I mean, he's way too shy.

311
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:40,170
'But your little Miss Thing
is gonna steal the show!'

312
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,840
Yeah, I'm, I'm not sure Mallie
wants to be part of a show.

313
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,180
But she has to,
we're gonna have all the winners

314
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,250
read a passage
from their favorite book

315
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,720
you know, to inspire
the other kids to read.

316
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,890
I'm head
of the parents' association.

317
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,260
We're always looking
for volunteers. Are you local?

318
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:57,960
I am, I own
a children's store on 3rd.

319
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,890
Get out! What's it called?

320
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,700
Juvenile Shop
Children's Boutique.

321
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,530
I know it.
I'm gonna peek by for myself.

322
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,430
Mallie got a dress
from my shop that I made.

323
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:07,700
- She wanted--
- Actually, about the--

324
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,870
No kidding!

325
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:12,540
We should have you
present an award to the kids.

326
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,010
You know, we need to show..

327
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,380
...our community
supports each other

328
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,390
and it would be great exposure
for your shop.

329
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,890
- I would love it.
- Lena, always good to see you.

330
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,920
And, Karina, nice to meet you.
I've got to run.

331
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,260
Always a million things.
I'll be in touch.

332
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:37,260
She's a ball of energy?

333
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,230
She sure is.

334
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,740
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

335
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,570
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Will Mallie be excited?

336
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,840
Yeah, I guess I am.

337
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,080
Have to take back all of that.

338
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:53,910
My God, I-I..

339
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,520
I'm so sorry, I thought that
you, you changed your mind

340
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,090
I assumed that--

341
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,760
- It's fine. It's fine.
- I..

342
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,830
Did Mallie say anything
about the other day?

343
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:09,630
She, she thought the man
knew where the fairies lived

344
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,930
and was about to go
right along with him.

345
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,740
See why I have to keep
such a tight leash on her?

346
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,270
I mean, she's amazing,
but she's a handful.

347
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:21,810
Well, I can help keep eyes
on her if you'd like me to.

348
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,640
That's.. I don't wanna
burden you with that.

349
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,810
It's not a burden.
It's what you do.

350
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,820
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

351
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:41,400
Sounds like you made that
new friend you were hoping for.

352
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,060
Is it strange
that I feel more connected

353
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,730
to Lena's kid than to her?

354
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,600
You want one just like her?

355
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,240
I do.

356
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,170
Careful, Lena's gonna think
maybe you're trying

357
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:54,510
to swipe her for yourself.

358
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,880
Poor Lena.

359
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:59,010
You know, she was
so unnecessarily worried

360
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:02,750
about the worst thing happening,
and then it almost did.

361
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,480
This is the world
that we're living in

362
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:07,850
and this is why
I have such hesitation.

363
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,190
What if I can't protect--

364
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:11,260
Don't start thinking like that.

365
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:13,760
We live in the kind of world
that we make for ourselves

366
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,230
and you and I
are working towards

367
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,930
the life we've always wanted.

368
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,200
We are.

369
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,210
- Speaking of work..
- Karina..

370
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,710
You have everything it takes
to be a great mother.

371
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:37,250
- I'm glad you're so sure.
- I am.

372
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,820
I wanna be sure, too.

373
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,930
I just hope that one day..

374
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,430
...I can be everything
that a child needs.

375
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,380
More sugar, anyone?

376
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:06,580
Mine is perfect. Thank you.

377
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,880
Mine needs more flavor.

378
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,450
What kind of tea
are we having today, my love?

379
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,190
''- Ooh.

380
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,260
I thought I detected, um

381
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:20,060
fresh notes of the garden
in my tea.

382
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,100
Delicious, like always.

383
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:26,030
Honey, mommy really needs
some caffeine.

384
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:30,400
Are you okay if I go inside and
make Karina and I some coffee?

385
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,070
Sure, and then you can
get rid of the yucky taste

386
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:36,040
with my world-famous
delicious tea!

387
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,350
Okay, my love.
I'll be right back.

388
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:45,250
So, Mallie, did you come up
with this recipe yourself?

389
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:47,250
Yeah. I just maked it up.

390
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:49,460
Well, it's delicious.

391
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:53,190
Well, I've been having tea
parties for a very long time.

392
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,060
I used to have tea parties
with my dolls.

393
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,830
Brings back very good memories.

394
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:03,440
Yeah, me, too.
I miss my dolls sometimes.

395
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:06,770
- Well, where are they?
- I-I don't know.

396
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:09,310
I had different dolls and toys

397
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,780
when I was called Emily.

398
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:15,620
Well, is Mallie
your middle name?

399
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:19,490
No. At my other house
my name was Emily.

400
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:24,930
Right.

401
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,930
You moved here right before
you started school.

402
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,460
Yup.

403
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,770
Well, did you change your name
when you started school?

404
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:38,340
Mallie?

405
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:42,480
Mom, can we have those treats

406
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,710
you were saving
for a special day?

407
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,780
Well, you're gonna break me down
anyway, so, yes.

408
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,290
- 'But only one, okay, love?'
- Okay.

409
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,590
The coffee will just be
another minute.

410
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:00,830
This is nice.

411
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:03,130
Yeah, it is.

412
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:05,170
You gotta, you gotta watch her.

413
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,530
She'll take two
and tell you otherwise.

414
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,370
- Yeah, she's quite a character.
- Yeah, she is.

415
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,640
She, um..

416
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,110
She told me
her name used to be Emily.

417
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,450
Really?

418
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:27,520
Last week she was telling people
that her mom was famous.

419
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,160
Can you imagine
their disappointment

420
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:32,030
when they meet me? I mean..

421
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,800
What am I gonna do with her?

422
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,400
It's odd, isn't it?

423
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,040
'It is, but she's a kid.'

424
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,440
'Kids say things and don't
analyze them the way adults do.'

425
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,910
Yeah, but what if she was trying
to tell me something?

426
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:54,820
- What do you think's going on?
- I don't know.

427
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,180
But what if something is?

428
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:58,890
Well, you asked Lena
and she gave you an answer

429
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,220
but you weren't satisfied
with it.

430
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,860
I think
she was dodging my question.

431
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,190
Well, she left her husband
or something along those lines.

432
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,900
Maybe she needs to protect
their identity.

433
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:12,270
But what if it's not that
and it's something worse?

434
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,140
Hold that thought.

435
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:25,380
Emma? Hi.

436
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,180
What a little treasure trove.

437
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,650
I can't believe
I've not been here before.

438
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:32,090
I brought you a flyer
for the assembly.

439
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,720
Thanks.

440
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,920
Gosh, really, just too cute.

441
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,960
It was so great
meeting you the other day

442
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:40,060
and thanks so much
for stopping by.

443
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,800
I'm sorry I interrupted.

444
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:44,130
But Lena would've kept you all
to herself now, wouldn't she?

445
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:46,670
She keeps a lot of things
to herself.

446
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,400
I mean, you know, in contrast to
Mallie because she's just such--

447
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,940
A little spitfire? I know it.

448
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,740
Dylan had kindergarten
with her, too.

449
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,240
So you must know them
really well.

450
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:01,250
No one does. Lena keeps
her head down and to herself.

451
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,920
Which is why I was so happy
to see her with you.

452
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,720
Well, yeah.
Why do you think that is?

453
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,790
Well, she's a pinch older.

454
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:12,160
And, well, despite our efforts
to rope her in

455
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:14,530
she doesn't strike me
as much of a joiner.

456
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,300
Yeah, well, you know, it must be
hard being all on her own.

457
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:24,540
But, I mean, let your kid take
a school picture, am I right?

458
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,510
What do you mean?

459
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,440
Mallie doesn't do a picture day.

460
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,910
Lena is afraid
of child predators

461
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:32,950
and how stressful
to be wired that way.

462
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,550
But enough about Lena.

463
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,320
'I don't want you thinking
I'm all gossipy'

464
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,920
when we're just
getting to know each other.

465
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,690
- No, that's not--
- I'm kidding.

466
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,660
I'm kidding.

467
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:46,660
But I'm telling you,
get ready for a rush

468
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,930
because I'm gonna tell everyone
about this place.

469
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,930
That's so nice of you.

470
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,000
Do you hike? I have a group.

471
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,840
We, hit the trail and then
we gorge ourselves over lunch.

472
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:00,810
Sounds like my kind of group.

473
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,880
I know where to find you.

474
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,350
<i> The books I ordered came in</i>

475
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:14,020
so I thought I'd swing by
Lena's and drop 'em off

476
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,490
to save her a trip.

477
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,520
I should be home
within the hour.

478
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,160
'No rush.'

479
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,060
- Okay, bye.
- 'Bye.'

480
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,200
'Hi, it's Lena. Sorry I missed
your call. Leave a message.'

481
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,080
'911. What's your emergency?'

482
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:22,920
Yeah, hi, I'm at
1-1-0-3-0 Woodland Avenue.

483
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,390
There's an incident,
an altercation, maybe.

484
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,090
I think my friend's in trouble.

485
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:30,630
- 'Are you inside the home now?'
- No, I'm-I'm in the car.

486
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:32,570
I just saw a man
go into the house.

487
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,700
I, I think
I hear them struggling.

488
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,740
'Officers
are on their way, ma'am.'

489
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,470
'Please stay
inside your vehicle.'

490
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,540
Thank you.

491
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,380
- 'Right now!'
- 'Lena, Lena..'

492
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,480
'Lena, put that down.'

493
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,650
'Lena, put that down!'

494
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:08,170
'It is none of your business.
Keep her out of this.'

495
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,340
'Okay. You have to stop.
Lena, no, put that down.'

496
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:15,510
'Put that.. Lena, no, no! No.'

497
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,110
'Get out!'

498
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:20,610
'Get out! I said get out!'

499
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:25,890
Sorry.

500
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,770
Karina?
Wh-what are you doing here?

501
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,440
Lena, I called the police,
they're on their way.

502
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:46,810
Lena! Lena, are you okay?

503
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:50,110
Lena! God! Are you alright?

504
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,550
I-I heard you scream
and there was glass breaking--

505
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:56,750
It-it was just an unsuccessful
burglary, that's all.

506
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:05,360
Well, you did the right thing.

507
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:07,730
Is she okay?

508
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,500
She can sleep
through an air raid.

509
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:13,830
Lena, why don't I
take the couch tonight?

510
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:16,900
No, we're... We're fine.

511
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,640
I mean,
the police were thorough.

512
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,570
There's no reason for you
to trouble yourself, really.

513
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:23,680
It's no trouble.

514
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:26,180
It's just,
then I'd have to explain

515
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:28,650
why you're here and, you know

516
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,050
right now she doesn't know
anything's amiss.

517
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:32,220
I would, I would just

518
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:35,090
rather keep everything
status quo for now.

519
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:37,990
Understood.

520
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,600
What did you tell the police?

521
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,670
Exactly what I told you.

522
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:50,770
The same story.

523
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:53,570
I'm surprised
they didn't wanna question me.

524
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,380
I'm sure they have

525
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:58,710
bigger emergencies
to tend to than this.

526
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:03,520
I mean, I didn't wanna
keep them when we're fine.

527
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,930
So what's your analysis?

528
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:22,470
- What?
- Well, is it edible?

529
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:25,070
Thank you.

530
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,310
Thank you.

531
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:31,140
I'm sorry, babe.

532
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,420
I don't mind you
being out to lunch

533
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,380
but we're currently
out to dinner.

534
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:38,620
I know.

535
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:41,550
I just have this bad feeling
I can't shake.

536
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,560
Can you please try?

537
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,230
What if Mallie is in danger?

538
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:50,430
What if she needs our help?

539
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:53,230
Look, we can only be
so involved.

540
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:56,170
I mean, I understand that Mallie
has an over-active imagination

541
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,300
but I don't buy that
as an excuse

542
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:01,410
to hide what's going on
around her.

543
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,810
Would you do that?

544
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,610
No, but we're not her parents.

545
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:09,120
Just if something else
happens to her and we're--

546
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:13,190
Your empathy for her is a sign
you're gonna be a great mother

547
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,790
but we have to let
Mallie's mother

548
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,260
take care of her daughter
her way.

549
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,930
I get it.

550
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:21,590
You want me to drop
this whole thing.

551
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,100
Maybe I am misreading it.

552
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,400
But if I'm not

553
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:32,970
do you promise
that if Mallie's in danger

554
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:34,810
'we will help her?'

555
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,880
Of course.

556
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:44,280
I've always got your back.
You know that, right?

557
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:45,650
I know.

558
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,820
Thanks.

559
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:53,190
- Eat before it gets cold.
- Yeah.

560
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,830
'Luckily, they're gonna keep
the incident under wraps, so..'

561
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:00,070
'I'm so surprised you think
they want to alert the public.'

562
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,770
Well, I, I shared with them
that I've spent years

563
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,970
trying to conceal our
whereabouts from my ex-husband

564
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:07,310
and if they ran a story on me

565
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:09,640
all of those efforts
would go to waste, so..

566
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,110
So your ex-husband,
do you think that he's the one

567
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,950
that tried to take Mallie?

568
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:16,720
It was almost successful
when she was a little baby

569
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,990
but I'll never let that
happen again.

570
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:21,920
So it wasn't him.

571
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,160
When's the last time you've..

572
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:28,730
I've spent so many years
off the radar for Mallie's sake

573
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,730
it's-it's not natural for me to

574
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:33,600
you know,
settle into a community.

575
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,170
But you have been

576
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:39,240
just a wonderful gift for us.

577
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:41,370
- You guys, too.
- Don't get me wrong.

578
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:43,540
I mean, the parents here
are, are welcoming.

579
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,210
It's just

580
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:48,920
they're so involved
in everybody's lives, you know

581
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:52,150
it's just, it's nice to have
a friendship that isn't forced

582
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,420
because, you know,
a play date went well.

583
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,860
Yeah.

584
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,590
So when are you and Ryan

585
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:00,730
getting
in the baby-making business?

586
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,960
Technically, we already are.

587
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:14,810
What did I tell you?
Isn't this the cutest ever?

588
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,510
Karina, this is Jenn.

589
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:19,750
We were just talking
baby shower registry

590
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,410
and I brought her
straight over here

591
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:23,120
because you have all this stuff.

592
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:25,250
I mean, all this great stuff.

593
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:27,290
I wouldn't know what to call it.

594
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,260
I could've really used
this place when I had Dylan.

595
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:30,960
Great to meet you, Jenn.
Congratulations.

596
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:33,230
Thanks. And you, too.
Emma said you're new here.

597
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:35,260
You know, it's been about
a year, but it's taken a million

598
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,600
to get settled and to get
this place up and running.

599
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:39,300
Well, you've done a great job

600
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:41,100
and now you need
to get acquainted here.

601
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,400
Do you hike?

602
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,410
Yes, I do, but I am
more inclined to do so

603
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,310
if it's followed by a brunch.

604
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:50,240
- What did I tell you?
- She's gonna fit right in.

605
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:54,610
So her husband does
all the wood stuff

606
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,920
and she does all the dresses.

607
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,950
You're kidding.. Wow!

608
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,620
So talented.

609
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:03,090
Idea. So I'm hosting
Jenn's baby shower.

610
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:05,060
What do you think
if we have it here?

611
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,260
I mean, we can move
all the middle stuff out

612
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,230
and have the food over there.

613
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:11,130
I mean, it would be
great exposure for you

614
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:14,470
and you get to meet everyone.

615
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,670
I love it.
You know, that sounds like fun.

616
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,070
Just let me know
what I need to do to help.

617
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:20,470
She said yes.

618
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:22,610
- You don't mind?
- I love the idea.

619
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:25,410
- That is amazing.
- Unique, right?

620
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:27,780
I'm tired
of the same old shindig.

621
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:39,530
Since we're here,
um, we could actually

622
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,900
do these things as parents,
you know?

623
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:44,930
We could. Is it weird
that we don't have a kid?

624
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:47,330
We're going through the motions.
It's so easy, we just..

625
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:49,500
Speaking of that,
wait, wait. I have to go.

626
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,940
I told Lena that I would go
check on Mallie's dress

627
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,810
before the ceremony started.
Okay?

628
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:55,510
Sounds good. Do you want me
to save you a seat?

629
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,710
Yes, please. I'll be right back.

630
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:03,320
Mallie, you look so beautiful!

631
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,920
Are you excited
to read your book to everyone?

632
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:08,820
'Can I read Karina
my favorite part now?'

633
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:13,390
Honey, you, you h-had
the book. You had it in the car.

634
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:16,160
I had to carry my bag
with both hands.

635
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,400
'And my dress is too tight.'

636
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:21,630
N-no problem. I saw a couple
of copies at the front desk.

637
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:24,870
I can watch Mallie
if you wanna go get it.

638
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:26,870
- Okay. Are you sure?
- Of course.

639
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:29,040
Okay, hon, remember,
you're my most precious thing

640
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,910
in the world, okay?

641
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,310
Turn around. Let me see.

642
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:37,180
I know what the problem is.

643
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:39,390
You've been doing some growing.

644
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,220
I just knew what was happening.

645
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:44,220
I'm just gonna stick
my hand right underneath here.

646
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,230
- Okay?
- Okay.

647
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,030
What's this? What happened?

648
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:50,360
That's just my ugly spot.

649
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:54,070
Honey, no part of you is ugly.

650
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:57,470
The ugly goes away
when I keep the Band-Aid on it.

651
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,910
I see.

652
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:03,380
Band-Aids help things heal.
Does it hurt?

653
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,450
No. It's been there
as long as I can remember

654
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,050
that I forget.

655
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:11,050
Like a birthmark or a freckle?

656
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:14,020
No. Just a spot
that no one is supposed to see.

657
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,490
That's why my mom puts
a Band-Aid on it.

658
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:23,130
Hey.

659
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:27,970
Every part of you is perfect,
okay?

660
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,270
I don't want you hiding
any part of yourself.

661
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:33,770
I think
what you're saying is true.

662
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:36,680
Unless you're playing
hide and seek.

663
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:40,010
Mallie,
I think that you're right.

664
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:42,320
Let's see
if we can fix this dress.

665
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,230
And that's one of the things
I love about this book

666
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:58,800
which I recommend to everyone
and even their dogs.

667
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,900
'And that is our last recipient'

668
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,110
of Willow Elementary's
Eager Reader Award.

669
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:07,440
Let's give them all a hand.

670
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,850
Okay, it's picture time.

671
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:21,250
Hey. Hey, hey, hey,
where are you goin'?

672
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,790
Don't you wanna get your picture
taken with the group?

673
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:26,960
Where do you think
the picture will be?

674
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,890
Maybe in the newspaper.

675
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:32,060
For everyone to see? Even people
that don't live here?

676
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:36,040
- Probably.
- Will our names be in there?

677
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:38,640
Maybe.

678
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:42,680
You know, I've always wanted
to be in the newspaper.

679
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:45,110
Mom's not gonna like it, though.

680
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:47,210
Why not?

681
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:50,220
She doesn't like us
taking pictures.

682
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:56,320
Well, we better not, then.

683
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:59,530
Hey, how about I see
if I can still get your name in?

684
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,390
- Would you like that?
- Yeah.

685
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,600
We're gonna take off.

686
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:04,360
They're just gonna do a picture.
But..

687
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,010
<i> But let your kid take</i>
<i> a school picture, am I right?</i>

688
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:19,150
'What do you mean?'

689
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,880
Mallie doesn't do a picture day.

690
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,620
'I called the police
they're on their way.'

691
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:38,300
She, um, told me
her name used to be Emily.

692
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,400
Really?

693
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:46,510
What's this? What happened?

694
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,970
Just a spot
that no one is supposed to see.

695
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,050
- Hi.
- Hi.

696
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:01,990
- Hi.
- Um..

697
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:05,360
W-well, since you guys left
so quickly the other day

698
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:08,060
Mallie didn't get
her book.

699
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,230
- And I, I brought you this.
- Thanks.

700
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,970
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

701
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:26,180
Emma came by my shop
the other day

702
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:28,180
and, she brought Jenn.

703
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,150
She was just glowing,
it was really great, um..

704
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:33,720
And they invited me on a hike
on Sunday.

705
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,590
Have you ever went hiking
with them?

706
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,460
No. Actually, I haven't.

707
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:39,890
Just some things don't
make sense to get a sitter for.

708
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:41,830
- So.. Thanks.
- There you go.

709
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,360
Um, Ryan and I are happy
to watch Mallie for you

710
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:48,070
any evening
that you wanna go out.

711
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,540
We're, we're okay.

712
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:54,170
Lena, about the group photo
yesterday..

713
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,380
Are we okay?

714
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,780
Sure. I just, I mean..

715
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,620
Sorry, I was..

716
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,650
What?

717
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,960
You know, I..

718
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:16,230
Mallie wouldn't take
her medal off.

719
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,730
You must be so proud.

720
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:21,970
She's a good kid. I'm lucky.

721
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,300
Do you...ever wish

722
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,270
that her dad
was still in the picture?

723
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:29,380
No, we're..

724
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:31,910
We're fine on our own.

725
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,280
Do you mind me asking
what happened?

726
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:40,520
Well, there's really
nothing to share.

727
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:42,860
We..

728
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,830
We just moved forward.

729
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,600
Why don't you let her
take a picture, Lena?

730
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:53,730
Why don't you stay out of this?

731
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,270
I'm just concerned.

732
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:00,770
You know, if you are hiding
from something

733
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:02,170
you can let me know. I--

734
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,740
Excuse me?

735
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,010
How dare you suggest
I'm hiding something?

736
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:09,010
- I didn't say that.
- No?

737
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:11,950
You're not a parent.

738
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:16,860
You could do me a favor.

739
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:19,690
Stop trying to parent my child.
Okay?

740
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:21,530
That's not what I'm doing.

741
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,600
- No?
- No, I am concerned.

742
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:27,000
- Mallie has told me something--
- Mallie is a child.

743
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:31,000
You have, you don't have any
business talking to a child

744
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,740
without their parent there.

745
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,410
I mean, she is a kid.

746
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,450
Kids say things..

747
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,120
I mean, come on.

748
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,220
Especially kids
who read a lot of books.

749
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,890
- I mean..
- I know.

750
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,520
And I am not a parent

751
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,220
and I have no idea
what you've been through.

752
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,530
But I want you to know

753
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,800
that I am here if you need me.

754
00:41:58,130 --> 00:41:59,570
What I need right now..

755
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,300
...is for you to leave.

756
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:54,620
Are you Karina Harlow?

757
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,760
I am.

758
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:58,820
Come in.

759
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:07,270
We were visited
by a Lena Colbert.

760
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:10,870
- Do you know her?
- I do.

761
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:12,540
Well, Ms. Colbert's requested

762
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,870
to file a restraining order
against you.

763
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:16,840
Why? What did I do?

764
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,480
'According to Ms. Colbert,
there's been'

765
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:21,050
some inappropriate behavior
regarding her daughter.

766
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:23,680
Like what? That's crazy.

767
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,950
Did you tell her that
her daughter was taken by a man

768
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:28,390
while the child
was in your care?

769
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,460
Well, yes.

770
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:31,160
'Were you outside of her home'

771
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:32,830
'when you thought
you saw a man enter'

772
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:33,830
'and you took it upon yourself'

773
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:35,960
to call the police?

774
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,330
'Did you gift her daughter
with several items'

775
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:40,170
'including a custom-made dress'

776
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,000
'that you later
made alterations to'

777
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:45,440
while it was on the child,
with no other adults present?

778
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,940
That's not how it happened.

779
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,640
That's not
how it happened at all.

780
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:51,240
This is not right.

781
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,650
Ms. Colbert
is feeling very uncomfortable

782
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,010
with the multiple
false scenarios

783
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:56,920
that you've created
and embellished on

784
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:59,080
with no actual evidence
that they've occurred.

785
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,790
I didn't make any of this up.

786
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:02,520
Well, you've attempted
to involve the authorities

787
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,990
on more than one occasion,
all of which Ms. Colbert feels

788
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:07,530
'are the product
of delusional paranoia.'

789
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,700
'Now her daughter has expressed
discomfort as well.'

790
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,600
Did you even talk to Mallie?

791
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:13,430
If we do go through
with serving you

792
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:15,330
you'd have to appear in court.

793
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:17,040
I know that might not be
the best thing

794
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:18,640
for a business
that caters to minors

795
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:21,240
so she has agreed
to a polite warning.

796
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,040
She's not right.

797
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,010
You have to talk to her
about her daughter.

798
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:26,480
- She is hiding something.
- Ms. Harlow.

799
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,380
If I have
to speak with you again

800
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:31,280
it'll be in regard
to a court-ordered appearance.

801
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:34,150
Respect her wishes.

802
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,720
Have a good day.

803
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,400
Is everything alright?

804
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:47,300
No.

805
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:50,000
Should I be worried?

806
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:56,310
Lena's trying
to cast suspicion on me

807
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:59,080
so they don't suspect her.

808
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:00,910
'I know I have a tendency
to keep to myself'

809
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:03,920
and I hope it doesn't insult you
or your efforts to include me.

810
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:07,250
It's just,
being a single parent is..

811
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:09,250
...it's hard.

812
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:12,160
Of course. We're here
if you ever need a hand.

813
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:15,360
Actually, that's why I wanted
to, um, talk with you guys and..

814
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:19,160
I don't wanna start
any problems or..

815
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:22,900
But Mallie has, has said
some things to me

816
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:26,770
and I just,
I can't, I can't ignore it.

817
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:30,210
Mallie has shared
that there have been some things

818
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,410
that have made her
uncomfortable.

819
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:36,080
And again, I don't, I don't
want to jump to any conclusions

820
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,880
or cast anyone in a bad light

821
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:42,690
but, you know,
she's, she's my kid.

822
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:44,820
Of course. What happened?

823
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,800
It's Karina.

824
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:54,200
I would
really appreciate your help

825
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:57,540
in ensuring Karina
keeps her distance from Mallie.

826
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:59,070
Did she do something to Mallie?

827
00:45:59,170 --> 00:46:03,610
She can be a little aggressive

828
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:06,040
in her urges to parent my child.

829
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,310
And I just..

830
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:10,750
I feel a line has been crossed.

831
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:13,490
T-thank you.
I-I'm sure this wasn't easy.

832
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,320
I just, I felt as a parent..

833
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,920
...you had a right to know.

834
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,460
You have our support.

835
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,500
It's Karina.

836
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:27,830
- That's uncomfortable.
- Right?

837
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:33,810
It's so sad.

838
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:38,410
This couple that has a business
that caters to children..

839
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:40,480
...they can't have a child
of their own.

840
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:42,050
Just breaks my heart.

841
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:01,000
Hey, so I don't want
to alarm you or anything

842
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,400
but there's been a man
hanging around here.

843
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,910
He was in a blue Jeep and..

844
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,340
Just keep a close eye on her.

845
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:15,150
Are you kidding?

846
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:22,150
I had Maya the same month
that little Emily went missing.

847
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:24,060
We flew out of Copeland County

848
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:26,860
as soon as I recovered
from my C-section.

849
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:28,930
I'll never shake that.

850
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:31,730
Emily?

851
00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:34,100
That little girl
that was kidnapped.

852
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:36,000
About five years ago.

853
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:39,710
What a nightmare.

854
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,540
Have a good one.

855
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:54,850
'Please, we beg you.'

856
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:58,560
'Return our little girl.'

857
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:07,800
If anyone has seen anything
or knows any information..

858
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,200
'...please..'

859
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:15,970
She has a birthmark.
Right here.

860
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,650
Tragedy strikes
in Copeland County this morning

861
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,290
as a married couple
was killed in a car crash

862
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,790
just south of the I-45 bridge.

863
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:32,120
Lacy and Tom Worthington
were on their way to the airport

864
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,630
at around 6.30 a.m.

865
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,990
says the Copeland County
sheriff's office

866
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:39,260
when their vehicle lost control
and flipped upside down.

867
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:41,600
'The couple was killed
instantly.'

868
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,000
'This news comes
almost two years after'

869
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,740
'the late couple's daughter
was abducted from their home.'

870
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:50,280
Tom and Lacy leave
no surviving family.

871
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:52,140
'But friends mourning
at the crash site say'

872
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:54,910
'they were inspired by
the couple's tireless search..'

873
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:01,590
Ryan, you have to see this.

874
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:03,890
This Emily Worthington
would be nearly eight

875
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,090
and Mallie
is nearly eight as well.

876
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:08,030
And they're both
blonde-haired, blue-eyed.

877
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:11,330
I hate to say it, but so are
most of the other little girls

878
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:14,870
that go missing, and Emily
is a pretty common name.

879
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:17,040
And what about the car crash?

880
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:27,480
But this girl was taken right
out from under her mom's nose.

881
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:30,380
Right from her bedroom
in Copeland County.

882
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:33,150
And she has a birthmark.

883
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:36,660
- Who? Mallie or Emily?
- Both.

884
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:38,820
Mallie has a spot
on her shoulder

885
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:40,560
that Lena makes her cover
with a Band-Aid

886
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:43,460
and Emily had one
on the back of her shoulder

887
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,130
in the same area.

888
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,740
Well, could Mallie have
heard this story somewhere

889
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:52,800
and just kinda made it her own?

890
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:56,270
I don't think so. She was three
when this happened.

891
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,880
Wow, I don't know.

892
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,920
You're gonna have
to talk to Lena about this.

893
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:05,350
Well, if I ask
too many questions

894
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:07,550
she just might pick up
and disappear with Mallie

895
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:09,250
somewhere untraceable.

896
00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:13,860
Well, once you make
an accusation like this

897
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,590
you can't come back from it.

898
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:18,800
Start with Lena before you do
or say anything to anyone.

899
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:20,800
I just have to do right
by Mallie, you know

900
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:23,600
and she doesn't want me
anywhere near them.

901
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:26,270
And now I know why.

902
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,610
Hey, Jenn, what's going on?

903
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:34,850
Hey there, so I really
appreciate you offering

904
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:38,750
to host the shower, it's just,
the more I think about it

905
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:40,820
I'm starting to feel like
a hot-air balloon

906
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:43,920
and I think I just wanna
keep it intimate and easy.

907
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,590
Yeah, of course.

908
00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:47,930
Yeah, We're just gonna do it
at my house with family

909
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,260
and a few close friends.
I don't want a fuss.

910
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:52,960
I totally understand.

911
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,930
Let me know if there's anything
I can do to help.

912
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:57,400
'Thanks. You take care.'

913
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,800
You, too.

914
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:06,280
Lena's already going
after, my new friends.

915
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:07,810
What do you mean?

916
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:10,280
The friends that I just made,
they're pulling away.

917
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,750
I'm not backing down.

918
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:15,420
Okay, I support that

919
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,260
but she's actively going ahead
of you to discredit you.

920
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,960
Are you really up
for that kind of a fight?

921
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:22,290
I have to do right by Mallie

922
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:24,700
even if it costs me
my reputation.

923
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:29,900
Maybe go around Lena.

924
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,770
You know, enlist the help of
someone who isn't in the circle.

925
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:36,780
You're right.

926
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:43,680
<i> Hey, Cam, can you meet me?</i>
<i> It's urgent.</i>

927
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,820
'I'm just trying to figure out
why she would wanna'

928
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:47,420
keep this burglary quiet.

929
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,690
I mean, I would wanna
get this guy, right?

930
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:52,290
Well, by the sound of the
bleeding, I mean, she got him.

931
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:54,060
Maybe that's the reason why.

932
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:56,360
Maybe.

933
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,530
And I went to the local library
to find out what I could

934
00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:00,470
on Emily Worthington case.

935
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:02,200
There wasn't much,
she's from a small town

936
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,800
there wasn't
a lot of coverage on it, but..

937
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:09,640
...I found this picture of her.

938
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:12,280
This is her, this is Mallie.

939
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:17,720
That's quite
a striking resemblance.

940
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:19,820
You know what, can you send that
to me for reference?

941
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:22,850
Of course, of course.

942
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:26,160
And would you mind presenting
this to the authorities?

943
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:27,460
I just don't think
that they would take me

944
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:28,560
seriously right now.

945
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,060
Absolutely.

946
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:32,630
Karina?

947
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,240
Sorry to interrupt.

948
00:52:39,270 --> 00:52:41,010
I just wanted to say
thanks again

949
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:43,480
for your offer
for Jenn's shower, but..

950
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:46,110
I know. Jenn called me.

951
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:49,410
Well, I'll see you around.

952
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,520
'Karina was having lunch
with some woman'

953
00:52:58,630 --> 00:53:00,560
'showing her a picture
of Mallie.'

954
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:03,830
'It was so strange, when I came
over, she hid the picture.'

955
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,760
'I was sure
she was up to something'

956
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,370
<i> so I waited and got her</i>
<i> friend's license plate number.</i>

957
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:11,170
<i> I have a friend at the DMV</i>
<i> who gave me her address.</i>

958
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:12,700
<i> I think you should go</i>
<i> and talk to her and figure out</i>

959
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:14,510
<i> what's really going on.</i>

960
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,380
'9-1-1. What's the emergency?'

961
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:39,820
'Hello?'

962
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:46,730
I'm sorry, I-I just felt like
I took too much of a break today

963
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,690
and I need to catch up.

964
00:55:48,830 --> 00:55:50,760
I left you some food
on the counter.

965
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:54,570
Aw, thanks.
I'll be home in a bit.

966
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,570
'Well, I'll try
to wait up for you.'

967
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:01,070
No, that's okay. I'll
snuggle into bed next to you.

968
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:04,480
Alright. Love you.

969
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:05,740
You, too.

970
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:23,760
'Paging Dr. Roth, please report
to Emergency immediately.'

971
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:30,540
Hey.

972
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,370
- Hey.
- Hey.

973
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:36,110
Um..

974
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:37,280
Help me get this out.

975
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:39,310
- No, sweetie.
- We have to go.

976
00:56:39,350 --> 00:56:42,210
No, no, the doctor said
if you hadn't turned your head

977
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:43,950
when you did,
this could have been fatal.

978
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:45,620
I'm fine, I promise.
We have to go.

979
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:48,290
Honey, no.

980
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,120
The police think
that this was a robbery.

981
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:53,790
It was not a robbery,
Ryan, please.

982
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:57,300
Honey, Look at me. Look at me.

983
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:58,960
This was a really close call.

984
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,030
You've been in some really
dangerous situations lately.

985
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:04,340
Okay, it's time
to take a step back.

986
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,170
Please.

987
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:12,480
That's weird.

988
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:17,180
Hello?

989
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:20,080
Yes, this is she.

990
00:57:23,090 --> 00:57:24,820
My gosh.

991
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:27,560
Is she okay?

992
00:57:27,590 --> 00:57:30,660
'Will the orderly on duty
please come to reception?'

993
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:38,970
Hey.

994
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:42,870
Love ya.

995
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:45,180
I couldn't ask
for a better friend.

996
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,850
I'm so sorry.

997
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:50,320
Karina.

998
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:51,780
I couldn't protect her.

999
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:54,720
I can't even protect myself.

1000
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:57,160
Hey, you couldn't
even if you wanted to.

1001
00:57:57,290 --> 00:58:00,230
How am I gonna protect Mallie?

1002
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:02,430
Okay, these incidents

1003
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:04,660
they are unfortunate,
but they are unrelated.

1004
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,400
Do you honestly believe that?

1005
00:58:07,430 --> 00:58:09,200
Because I'm not gonna
be able to forgive myself

1006
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:11,070
if I don't do something.

1007
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:13,610
Okay, that may be,
but you shouldn't do anything

1008
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:14,910
without the help
of the authorities.

1009
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:17,410
They're not going
to listen to me or you.

1010
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,240
We have to push forward.

1011
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,710
We can't handle this, we're not
equipped, we need their help.

1012
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:26,380
The police think
that I'm a danger to Mallie.

1013
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:27,450
They've already threatened
to slapped me

1014
00:58:27,490 --> 00:58:29,020
with a restraining order.

1015
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:32,160
Why would we waste our energy
trying to convince them

1016
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:34,860
that they're wrong when
we can use that to help Mallie?

1017
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,030
Sweetie, you're upset.

1018
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:39,860
Okay, I know this is very
difficult to see Cam like this

1019
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,400
but, sweetie, please,
I need you to think clearly.

1020
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:45,670
Is that really, really
the best choice of action?

1021
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:54,380
Lena's not well. I know it.

1022
00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:57,550
And if she's mentally unstable,
then she needs to get help.

1023
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:01,390
We have to think about Mallie
here, someone has to

1024
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:03,320
because if Mallie is Emily

1025
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:05,990
then we have to be sure,
you know?

1026
00:59:06,030 --> 00:59:08,490
I mean, one day
we might have a Mallie

1027
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:10,300
and if she's in trouble,
wouldn't we want someone

1028
00:59:10,330 --> 00:59:12,330
to do everything that they can
to help her?

1029
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:15,400
Okay, okay, I just think
we're entering territory here

1030
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:17,070
neither of us
know how to navigate.

1031
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,140
I know that you're scared,
I'm too, but we have--

1032
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:20,970
Do what, exactly?

1033
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:25,410
The man that tried
to take Mallie

1034
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:28,150
or the person that was
at their house that night

1035
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:31,250
they may have been involved
in the Emily kidnapping

1036
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:32,850
or they can know
something about Lena.

1037
00:59:32,890 --> 00:59:35,190
Okay, I don't want you
doing that alone.

1038
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:37,760
I can start by reviewing
the security-cam footage

1039
00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:39,790
from the day
that Mallie was almost taken.

1040
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:42,190
Maybe I can ID him or his car--

1041
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:43,660
Karina.

1042
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:49,130
And I won't do anything else
without you.

1043
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:53,670
Now can we please
get me cleared to leave here?

1044
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:04,850
'One minute please, ma'am.'

1045
01:00:12,590 --> 01:00:16,230
That's why I'm so surprised
he didn't report it. I..

1046
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:20,030
My son said that he scraped
the side of the car pretty bad.

1047
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:21,370
The poor man's probably worried

1048
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,470
about how much
this is gonna cost him.

1049
01:00:25,870 --> 01:00:29,510
That's exactly why
I wish he had left a note and..

1050
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:35,650
I'm just trying to teach my son
responsibility for his actions

1051
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:37,150
that's why I want him
to call the man

1052
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,280
and properly report the damage
and apologize.

1053
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:44,020
Can you get me a number?

1054
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:46,990
'I found a similar Jeep
under an Ivan Serling.'

1055
01:00:52,270 --> 01:00:53,670
Ivan Serling.

1056
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,830
I know she's dangerous.

1057
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:59,100
I was trying to get Mallie
away from her.

1058
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:01,010
I thought you were trying
to kidnap her.

1059
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:02,710
No, I understand that
in retrospect

1060
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:06,740
but you don't know my wife
like I do.

1061
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:09,610
- I had to take the chance.
- Lena's your wife?

1062
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:13,690
Technically, yeah,
but I haven't seen her in years.

1063
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:16,020
For the last week, like I said,
I've been tracking her

1064
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,720
to try to save Mallie from her.

1065
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:20,860
How long have you been
tracking her?

1066
01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:23,030
Her real name
is Isabelle Redder.

1067
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:27,200
I searched every county court
in the state for her name change

1068
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:31,070
and a few weeks ago
I finally got lucky.

1069
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:32,800
And it was here.

1070
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:36,940
One day I saw her,
but she was with a little girl.

1071
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:40,580
For a brief second,
I lost it, I thought

1072
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:45,150
"What if
that little girl was mine?"

1073
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:47,720
You know, m-maybe she didn't
wanna raise a child with me

1074
01:01:47,850 --> 01:01:50,120
and so she tried to kill me..

1075
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:53,760
Then I came to my senses and I-I
realized w-what's bothering me

1076
01:01:53,790 --> 01:01:55,990
is that she looks so familiar

1077
01:01:56,030 --> 01:01:57,930
and not because
she may be my daughter.

1078
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:00,830
A few days before she left me

1079
01:02:00,870 --> 01:02:05,040
we went by this park and..

1080
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:08,310
...she was fixed
on this little blonde girl

1081
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:10,840
about three years old.

1082
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:14,250
Said it reminded her
of her littler Abby, you know

1083
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:16,380
the one who was taken from her.

1084
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:19,180
Where were you living
at the time?

1085
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:20,890
Copeland County.

1086
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:24,020
I think that toddler
might be Mallie.

1087
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:27,760
I knew she was violent.
But kidnapping?

1088
01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:30,600
I never thought that she'd be
capable of such a thing.

1089
01:02:30,730 --> 01:02:32,400
But I-I..

1090
01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:35,400
I don't know anymore.

1091
01:02:37,870 --> 01:02:39,170
You should try to understand

1092
01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:41,840
that Lena wasn't always
this way.

1093
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,810
It's because of what happened
to her when she was a child.

1094
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:47,880
Isabelle, or Lena

1095
01:02:47,910 --> 01:02:50,110
gave birth at 16

1096
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:53,180
but Lena's doctor diagnosed her
as having a mental illness

1097
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:55,950
<i> and that meant</i>
<i> she was incapable</i>

1098
01:02:56,090 --> 01:02:58,990
<i> of safely raising a child.</i>

1099
01:02:59,090 --> 01:03:02,830
<i> She refused to give</i>
<i> that baby up for adoption.</i>

1100
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:05,530
<i> She ran away with the baby.</i>

1101
01:03:05,570 --> 01:03:10,030
<i> Her doctor told the Department</i>
<i>Of Children And Family Services</i>

1102
01:03:10,070 --> 01:03:12,200
<i> who came and took the child</i>
<i> from Lena.</i>

1103
01:03:17,110 --> 01:03:18,840
This was your child as well?

1104
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:23,350
No, no, this was years before
I met Isabelle.

1105
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:26,550
Her daughter
is in her twenties by now

1106
01:03:26,590 --> 01:03:29,920
raised by a, a loving family,
we're told.

1107
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:31,890
You need to tell the police
what really happened.

1108
01:03:31,930 --> 01:03:34,390
What's the point?
They won't believe me.

1109
01:03:39,230 --> 01:03:41,070
She's too dangerous.

1110
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:44,940
'Who knows what could happen?'

1111
01:03:44,970 --> 01:03:47,140
'And think about
what she can do to Mallie.'

1112
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:02,190
You made a terrible mistake.

1113
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:06,860
I will do anything
for my daughter.

1114
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:08,350
And if you all don't mind,
I would love for you guys

1115
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:11,160
to try my newest recipe.

1116
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:15,630
It only takes a few moments
for the magic powers to mix it.

1117
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,130
Abracadabra.

1118
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:19,760
'Mallie, come on,
it's time to go.'

1119
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:22,630
- But I have guests.
- Don't argue with me.

1120
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:25,140
- Five more minutes?
- Say goodbye to your friends.

1121
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:28,210
- Now.
- Okay.

1122
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:30,910
Psst. Mallie.

1123
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:32,810
- Karina.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1124
01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:37,480
You came just in time for tea.

1125
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:41,350
- I'm so lucky.
- Come in the yard.

1126
01:05:41,450 --> 01:05:43,720
Actually, I was wondering

1127
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:46,390
if, you wanna come with me.

1128
01:05:46,430 --> 01:05:50,030
If I come with you,
can I at least have a tea party?

1129
01:05:50,060 --> 01:05:51,760
Of course, sweetie,
of course, you can

1130
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:54,530
but you can only come
if you feel comfortable.

1131
01:05:54,630 --> 01:05:57,700
I think maybe I would like
to go to your house.

1132
01:05:57,740 --> 01:05:59,800
Okay, great. Come on, let's go.

1133
01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:13,120
'Are you going on a trip?'

1134
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:17,020
No, actually, we-we're
kind of on a trip right now.

1135
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:18,620
This is my best friend's house

1136
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:22,460
and she's not here,
so we're watching it for her.

1137
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:24,860
So it's kinda like
having two houses.

1138
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,460
Fun?

1139
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:30,400
Yeah. Karina,
I need to use the restroom.

1140
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:32,570
Okay, go ahead,
it's right in there.

1141
01:06:37,010 --> 01:06:38,310
What if Lena goes to the cops?

1142
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:39,710
She wouldn't risk it
a second time.

1143
01:06:39,850 --> 01:06:40,880
How can you be sure?

1144
01:06:41,010 --> 01:06:42,750
How can she report
her child missing

1145
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:45,220
if her child
is actually a missing child?

1146
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:50,320
Okay, the way we're going
about this, it looks really bad.

1147
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:52,320
Like, we're taking
a child as well.

1148
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:54,590
What? We didn't have a choice.

1149
01:06:54,630 --> 01:06:56,490
She was gonna leave with Mallie.

1150
01:06:56,530 --> 01:06:59,230
We were never gonna
see her again.

1151
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:01,300
Mallie is Emily.

1152
01:07:01,330 --> 01:07:03,330
No one's gonna care
how we prove it.

1153
01:07:03,370 --> 01:07:05,440
And how are we gonna prove that?

1154
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:07,000
Well, Lena attacked me
at the store.

1155
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:08,840
I can go and get
the video surveillance of it.

1156
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:10,510
Wait, Lena attacked you
at the sore?

1157
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:12,940
Ryan!

1158
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:16,210
You promised me
that you would do this.

1159
01:07:17,050 --> 01:07:18,580
Please.

1160
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:22,490
- Right, I'm going with you.
- No.

1161
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:25,890
Mallie, hey,
can you do me a huge favor

1162
01:07:25,990 --> 01:07:27,530
and, take care of Ryan?

1163
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:28,930
'Cause I gotta leave
for a little bit.

1164
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:30,490
Sure.

1165
01:07:30,530 --> 01:07:33,400
I think he might need
a hair cut.

1166
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:36,430
I think you're right.

1167
01:07:41,410 --> 01:07:44,310
Sit right down here, sir.

1168
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:46,910
Okay.

1169
01:07:54,090 --> 01:07:57,150
So where did you learn
how to do this?

1170
01:07:57,190 --> 01:08:00,990
Some things people
just have a natural talent for.

1171
01:08:01,030 --> 01:08:03,160
Well, you are very talented
at it.

1172
01:08:06,530 --> 01:08:08,630
I miss my daddy.

1173
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:12,100
Yeah?

1174
01:08:15,210 --> 01:08:17,170
Thank you for bringing me here.

1175
01:08:20,450 --> 01:08:22,380
I really like having you here.

1176
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:46,900
No, Lena.

1177
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:12,160
'...to an automatic
voice message.'

1178
01:09:15,370 --> 01:09:16,500
Ryan!

1179
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:20,000
Ryan!

1180
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:22,470
Damn it!

1181
01:09:22,540 --> 01:09:25,210
Ryan! Mallie!

1182
01:09:26,450 --> 01:09:29,680
My God, Ryan! Ryan!

1183
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:30,850
Ryan!

1184
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:36,290
Mallie's gone. Call the cops.

1185
01:09:49,770 --> 01:09:52,040
He's stable, but it's best
we keep him overnight.

1186
01:09:52,070 --> 01:09:54,000
The doctors would wanna
run some tests.

1187
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:56,740
We've notified the police,
so expect a call.

1188
01:09:56,780 --> 01:09:58,180
Get some sleep and you can
visit him in the morning.

1189
01:09:58,310 --> 01:10:00,110
Okay, let me know
if anything changes

1190
01:10:00,150 --> 01:10:01,680
and I'll come right over.

1191
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:04,010
We will.

1192
01:10:04,150 --> 01:10:06,550
- Any change.
- We will.

1193
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:18,920
My purse.

1194
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:31,470
'My sister and my niece
are staying with you.'

1195
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:32,540
I was wondering
if you could tell me

1196
01:11:32,570 --> 01:11:33,600
if they've checked in yet.

1197
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:34,940
My sister is staying with you

1198
01:11:35,070 --> 01:11:35,970
and I was wondering if you could

1199
01:11:36,010 --> 01:11:37,610
tell me if she's checked in yet.

1200
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:40,810
My niece, she's seven,
she's got blonde hair and..

1201
01:11:40,910 --> 01:11:44,980
Yes, I understand that
information is private, but..

1202
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:47,620
I understand, I understand,
I was just wondering if I could

1203
01:11:47,690 --> 01:11:49,350
give you the make and model
of their car

1204
01:11:49,390 --> 01:11:51,360
and you can tell me
if you've seen it?

1205
01:11:53,430 --> 01:11:55,360
Can you tell me
if our car is still there?

1206
01:11:55,390 --> 01:11:58,430
I-I, I just don't know if she's
left to come pick me up yet..

1207
01:11:58,530 --> 01:12:02,330
The license plate number
is 3-D-H, that's all I know.

1208
01:12:02,370 --> 01:12:04,370
It's California plates,
though. It..

1209
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:07,600
Yeah, yeah, I can wait.

1210
01:12:07,710 --> 01:12:09,470
It is?

1211
01:12:09,610 --> 01:12:12,380
Well, um, th-thanks so much, um.

1212
01:12:12,410 --> 01:12:15,150
Actually, my mom just texted me
and she was, like, in the shower

1213
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:18,120
when I called.
Okay, thanks a ton. Bye.

1214
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:02,890
'Mallie, are-are you ready?
Do you have all your stuff?'

1215
01:13:02,930 --> 01:13:04,360
- 'Think so.'
- 'Mallie.'

1216
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:06,200
'Gather up your things, okay?

1217
01:13:10,670 --> 01:13:13,440
- 'Mom, you said--'
- 'Come on, honey, let's go.'

1218
01:13:13,470 --> 01:13:16,040
- 'What's wrong?'
- 'Sweetie, grab your..'

1219
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:17,840
'Grab your bag. The car's here.'

1220
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:41,630
Mallie, let's go!

1221
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,740
Mallie.

1222
01:13:45,870 --> 01:13:47,910
Honey, hurry, come on.

1223
01:13:57,050 --> 01:13:58,320
Seatbelt.

1224
01:13:59,850 --> 01:14:01,550
No, no, no!

1225
01:14:15,870 --> 01:14:17,970
'Mom, where are we going?'

1226
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:19,740
<i> Mom, why are we moving again?</i>

1227
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:31,150
'Honey, please stop asking
so many questions.'

1228
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:33,050
'Mom, why are we moving again?'

1229
01:14:33,090 --> 01:14:35,250
'I'll tell you what, let me
find somewhere to pull over'

1230
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:36,750
'and I'll tuck you in
so you could get some sleep.'

1231
01:14:36,860 --> 01:14:38,160
'Is that okay?'

1232
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:45,830
Ivan.

1233
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:48,430
I need your help.

1234
01:15:03,050 --> 01:15:04,880
Isabelle Redder?

1235
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,990
I'm sorry,
you have the wrong number.

1236
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:12,660
'I know it's you, Isabelle.'

1237
01:15:12,730 --> 01:15:14,730
'I'm sorry about Abby.'

1238
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:18,900
I'm sorry they took her
from you. And I want to help.

1239
01:15:18,930 --> 01:15:21,200
- Please let me help.
- Stay out of this, Karina.

1240
01:15:21,230 --> 01:15:24,100
You took Abby to the overlook
to see the city

1241
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:25,870
'and that's the last time
you saw her.'

1242
01:15:25,910 --> 01:15:27,940
That.. That's not what happened.

1243
01:15:27,970 --> 01:15:31,480
You wanted her
to see the lights.

1244
01:15:31,580 --> 01:15:34,340
I bet you can't go there
without thinking about her.

1245
01:15:40,590 --> 01:15:41,720
Lena?

1246
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:08,750
Hey there.

1247
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:10,380
Hardly any cars
have passed through.

1248
01:16:10,450 --> 01:16:12,720
Well, we only need one.

1249
01:16:12,850 --> 01:16:14,120
This was the spot.

1250
01:16:15,290 --> 01:16:16,950
I took her here more than once

1251
01:16:16,990 --> 01:16:20,720
and she would just sit here
staring at over the city

1252
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:22,890
whispering to herself.

1253
01:16:23,030 --> 01:16:25,330
Thanks again for doing this.

1254
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:28,830
Listen, I'm gonna park my car
up there, out of sight.

1255
01:16:28,870 --> 01:16:31,300
All I need for you to do is
to distract her long enough

1256
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:33,540
for me to grab Mallie. Okay?

1257
01:16:41,010 --> 01:16:42,350
Anything?

1258
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:44,510
Not yet. Wait, wait..

1259
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:46,780
I do.

1260
01:16:47,850 --> 01:16:49,490
It's a gray sedan.

1261
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:50,720
'That will be her.'

1262
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:54,190
What if she sees me
and bolts?

1263
01:16:54,230 --> 01:16:56,090
Lay low
until she gets out of the car

1264
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:58,130
and then you approach her.

1265
01:16:58,230 --> 01:16:59,900
'Can you see a little girl
with her?'

1266
01:16:59,930 --> 01:17:03,330
No. Not from here.

1267
01:17:03,370 --> 01:17:05,500
Keep me on speaker, okay?
Don't hang up.

1268
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:06,870
You got it.

1269
01:17:33,270 --> 01:17:36,700
You always loved to come up here
and look at the city lights.

1270
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:43,240
Don't think
I didn't expect to see you here.

1271
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:47,940
Isa, I have missed you.

1272
01:17:47,980 --> 01:17:50,180
I know
you have missed her, but..

1273
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:52,750
...you have to stop running.

1274
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:54,280
Ivan.

1275
01:17:55,790 --> 01:17:57,450
Don't make this harder
than it has to be.

1276
01:17:57,490 --> 01:18:00,220
I agree.

1277
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:03,860
- Look, let's just start fresh.
- She's not yours.

1278
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:07,060
- And I'm not giving her up.
- Who?

1279
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:09,770
I'm not stupid, Ivan.

1280
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:11,570
Is there someone in the car
with you?

1281
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:16,210
If there were, do you really
think I would let you near her?

1282
01:18:16,310 --> 01:18:18,040
We can be a family.

1283
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:20,980
I'm not falling for this, Ivan.

1284
01:18:25,150 --> 01:18:27,820
What, you, you surprised?

1285
01:18:27,850 --> 01:18:30,990
- Look, you are not gonna--
- I am.

1286
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:33,220
- Because I have to.
- Put the gun down.

1287
01:18:33,330 --> 01:18:35,930
You know why? Because you will
never stop looking.

1288
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:38,330
Please put the gun down.

1289
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:41,430
- She will never stop looking.
- Please.

1290
01:18:41,470 --> 01:18:43,270
It's over, Ivan.

1291
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:46,170
Lena! No!

1292
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:51,240
God..

1293
01:18:55,010 --> 01:18:56,850
Help! Help!

1294
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:59,420
- Karina!
- Help!

1295
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:02,120
Ivan! Ivan?

1296
01:19:02,150 --> 01:19:04,550
- Can you hear me? Are you okay?
- 'No.'

1297
01:19:04,660 --> 01:19:07,090
'No, I'm not. I'm not.
I'm shot.'

1298
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:11,760
Karina?

1299
01:19:16,870 --> 01:19:18,440
You're something else.

1300
01:19:20,070 --> 01:19:22,640
I trusted you.

1301
01:19:22,670 --> 01:19:24,940
I let you into our home

1302
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:27,640
'into our lives.'

1303
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:29,980
This is about
what's right for Mallie.

1304
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:32,520
This is what's best for Mallie.

1305
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:37,550
It is not what's best
for Mallie.

1306
01:19:37,590 --> 01:19:39,460
You don't know
what's best for her.

1307
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:41,690
- I'm her mother!
- It's not! You're dangerous!

1308
01:19:41,730 --> 01:19:44,260
- She's not safe!
- She is safe with me!

1309
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:46,700
I'm her mother!

1310
01:19:47,570 --> 01:19:49,200
What?

1311
01:19:49,230 --> 01:19:51,740
You didn't uncover that
in your research?

1312
01:19:51,770 --> 01:19:54,640
Yeah,
that's 'cause I'm good.

1313
01:19:54,740 --> 01:19:56,370
And I'm an even better mother

1314
01:19:56,410 --> 01:19:58,780
'and I will do anything
for my Mallie.'

1315
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:08,020
- '911. What's your emergency?'
- 'Hello. I need help.'

1316
01:20:08,050 --> 01:20:10,490
'She has a gun.'

1317
01:20:10,590 --> 01:20:12,690
'Track my phone. I..'

1318
01:20:14,430 --> 01:20:17,160
Ivan. Ivan, are you okay?

1319
01:20:17,260 --> 01:20:18,830
It's okay, help is on the way.

1320
01:20:18,930 --> 01:20:20,830
- Okay?
- Karina!

1321
01:20:21,930 --> 01:20:25,070
Lena, you have to stop running.

1322
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:27,800
You have to stop hiding.

1323
01:20:27,910 --> 01:20:30,870
You have to give Emily up.

1324
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:33,910
You still have a chance
for a relationship with Abby.

1325
01:20:33,950 --> 01:20:36,010
Don't you want a relationship
with her?

1326
01:20:38,150 --> 01:20:40,180
It's too late for that.

1327
01:20:40,290 --> 01:20:42,020
That's not what she told me.

1328
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:46,990
- W-what?
- We found her.

1329
01:20:53,130 --> 01:20:55,100
It's time to stop hiding.

1330
01:20:56,670 --> 01:20:58,200
Please put down the gun.

1331
01:20:58,300 --> 01:21:00,670
Police. Put the gun down!

1332
01:21:00,710 --> 01:21:02,870
Slowly put the gun down

1333
01:21:02,980 --> 01:21:04,440
and step back.

1334
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:07,280
Please put down the gun.

1335
01:21:09,350 --> 01:21:11,250
'...gun down, ma'am.'

1336
01:21:14,690 --> 01:21:17,020
'Ma'am, put the gun down.'

1337
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,430
It's okay.

1338
01:22:45,780 --> 01:22:48,010
Do you want a cracker?

1339
01:22:48,110 --> 01:22:51,410
Who else needs a cracker?
Yum-yum yum-yum.

1340
01:22:53,420 --> 01:22:55,090
- Emily.
- Yeah?

1341
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:58,220
Come on out front,
Ryan and I wanna talk to you.

1342
01:22:58,260 --> 01:23:00,060
Okay. Bye.

1343
01:23:10,770 --> 01:23:12,440
Whoa!

1344
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:25,180
Emily, we have something
very important to tell you.

1345
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:27,280
Well, what is it?

1346
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:30,590
Well, we just found out
this morning..

1347
01:23:31,790 --> 01:23:33,590
That you're getting
a baby sister.

1348
01:23:33,630 --> 01:23:36,230
My own baby sister?

1349
01:23:41,630 --> 01:23:43,400
I love you.

1350
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:45,470
We love you, too.

1351
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,900
Thank you for everything.

1352
01:23:48,010 --> 01:23:49,570
Thank you.
