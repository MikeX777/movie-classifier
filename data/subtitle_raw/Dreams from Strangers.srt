1
00:02:40,839 --> 00:02:44,615
<i>This is the story of a man
who never stopped loving</i>

2
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:47,267
<i>because love goes beyond things.</i>

3
00:03:05,841 --> 00:03:10,513
<i>According to the definition,
free diving is a sport in which a man plunges</i>

4
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,820
<i>into deep seas holding his breath</i>

5
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:17,886
<i>without the support of any breathing apparatus.</i>

6
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:26,535
<i>It is an extreme sport,
which requires good physical preparation</i>

7
00:03:27,066 --> 00:03:31,161
<i>but most of all a strong mental predisposition.</i>

8
00:03:32,722 --> 00:03:35,922
<i>In underwater diving, you swim down several meters</i>

9
00:03:36,692 --> 00:03:39,828
<i>and if your mind has not reached a state of quiet</i>

10
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:43,641
<i>then unpleasant trouble can happen.</i>

11
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,727
<i>You can be physically strong</i>

12
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:34,241
<i>and still you might not be able
to control and convey your power.</i>

13
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:43,821
<i>You need a high level of balance
which is not merely a physical value.</i>

14
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:54,353
<i>Once you've achieved self-control,
you are vigilant and conscious</i>

15
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,745
<i>but also calm and relaxed at the same time.</i>

16
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:05,804
<i>When you swim down into the deep,</i>

17
00:05:06,031 --> 00:05:08,143
<i>you feel as if the world closes up above you</i>

18
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:11,239
<i>and another brand new one opens all of a sudden.</i>

19
00:05:17,743 --> 00:05:19,423
<i>I am a drop in the sea</i>

20
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:21,642
<i>I am part of it.</i>

21
00:05:22,681 --> 00:05:25,125
<i>I am water too.</i>

22
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:57,075
<i>A young girl, persecuted by evil criminals,</i>

23
00:06:57,099 --> 00:07:02,189
<i>writes to Maciste asking him to help her.</i>

24
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:13,175
<i>The appointment is at the old bridge.</i>

25
00:07:59,407 --> 00:08:07,407
<i>I hope you get my messages,
give me your news, I miss you!</i>

26
00:08:49,063 --> 00:08:52,007
<i>I come from a small town in the North of Italy</i>

27
00:08:52,274 --> 00:08:54,874
<i>a town of few people and few ambitions.</i>

28
00:08:55,936 --> 00:09:02,884
<i>People of my age, here,
either marry or move abroad</i>

29
00:09:02,968 --> 00:09:06,168
<i>where they can have more chances for their future.</i>

30
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:10,250
<i>But me, I remained.</i>

31
00:09:25,864 --> 00:09:29,603
<i>I am linked to my earth and my sea.</i>

32
00:09:30,262 --> 00:09:34,230
<i>My only goal is to stay submerged in water
as long as possible.</i>

33
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:38,648
<i>Only those who have tried it
can understand what I am saying.</i>

34
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:43,259
<i>So many hours every day
and so many days every week</i>

35
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:45,410
<i>consecrated to training.</i>

36
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:51,038
<i>Through physical effort,
we can change and transform ourselves.</i>

37
00:09:52,784 --> 00:09:57,522
<i>To me, water is a world, my world.</i>

38
00:10:02,861 --> 00:10:06,509
<i>In all these years,
I have had the good fortune to travel.</i>

39
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:12,287
<i>Each country has its own history,
traditions and beliefs.</i>

40
00:10:12,604 --> 00:10:16,091
<i>Traveling builds you up and makes you stronger.</i>

41
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:18,678
<i>It destroys the walls inside your mind</i>

42
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:20,562
<i>and it is only in that moment</i>

43
00:10:20,562 --> 00:10:23,954
<i>that you realize you are truly
beginning your journey.</i>

44
00:10:54,296 --> 00:10:59,626
<i>After Madrid, Barcelona and Berlin,
the long-awaited moment had come</i>

45
00:11:00,051 --> 00:11:04,531
<i>the most important swimming competition in Russia.</i>

46
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,103
<i>After a short stop in Munich,</i>

47
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:13,031
<i>I arrived in St. Petersburg
as part of the Italian delegation.</i>

48
00:11:17,436 --> 00:11:20,171
<i>I had never been there before.</i>

49
00:11:20,271 --> 00:11:23,058
<i>What it makes it interesting to go compete abroad</i>

50
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:25,861
<i>is that you never know
in which city you may end up</i>

51
00:11:25,861 --> 00:11:29,548
<i>and you are often hit by the beauty
and the history of those places.</i>

52
00:11:29,548 --> 00:11:31,348
<i>St. Petersburg does hit you</i>

53
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:37,355
<i>with its impressive stories
and its breathtaking architecture.</i>

54
00:13:41,204 --> 00:13:44,257
<i>Unfortunately the results
were not what I hoped for.</i>

55
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:48,865
<i>All those months and years of hard work
for a few minutes of competition.</i>

56
00:13:49,146 --> 00:13:51,613
<i>There you put everything on the line.</i>

57
00:13:52,983 --> 00:13:58,521
<i>On the other hand, you can't always excel
and perfection can also get boring.</i>

58
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:01,353
<i>But this is the fun part.</i>

59
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,996
<i>If a dream has so many obstacles,
it means that is the right one.</i>

60
00:15:27,644 --> 00:15:29,879
- Hi.
- Hi.

61
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,049
- May I?
- Sure!

62
00:15:38,755 --> 00:15:41,875
- I am Massimo.
- I know.

63
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,081
I am the interpreter.

64
00:15:46,337 --> 00:15:49,391
I did the simultaneous interpreting
for the press conference.

65
00:15:49,391 --> 00:15:52,569
Yes, okay. I am sorry.
I was afraid I had made a mistake.

66
00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:53,569
No.

67
00:15:55,263 --> 00:15:58,658
- I am Vladimir.
- Nice to meet you.

68
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,247
What are you drinking? Beer?

69
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,065
Yes.

70
00:16:08,026 --> 00:16:09,026
Why?

71
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:13,656
Here a true man must drink real, pure vodka.

72
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:18,386
- At lunch time?
- You're in Russia.

73
00:16:20,038 --> 00:16:24,075
- Here.
- No, thank you. I am not used to it.

74
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:26,361
I don't drink alcohol.

75
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:27,361
You don't?

76
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:31,313
Yes, well, a glass of beer
never killed anyone, did it.

77
00:16:31,966 --> 00:16:34,028
Well, it does if you don't drink alcohol!

78
00:16:34,052 --> 00:16:40,834
Then we can say that it is better
to not drink when in training.

79
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:44,854
- Then you are a fake non-drinker!
- Yes, right!

80
00:17:32,243 --> 00:17:33,843
- Cretino?
- Cretino.

81
00:17:34,646 --> 00:17:37,546
- But is it a bad word?
- No, you can use it.

82
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,549
Well, it is even used too often!

83
00:17:42,412 --> 00:17:46,465
All jokes aside, you speak Italian well.

84
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:47,465
Thank you!

85
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,525
With all the studying I did...

86
00:17:49,961 --> 00:17:52,297
You know, I have never been to Italy.

87
00:17:52,297 --> 00:17:53,497
I took lessons,

88
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:56,551
but I would really love to go
to your country one day or another.

89
00:17:56,551 --> 00:17:58,151
Why don't you do it?

90
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:02,262
If it up to me, I would be there already.

91
00:18:02,357 --> 00:18:04,490
It's a bit complicated, Massimo.

92
00:18:04,976 --> 00:18:08,513
I live with my mother and she is very ill.

93
00:18:08,613 --> 00:18:12,133
Moreover, I'm continuing to study
and money never lasts.

94
00:18:13,334 --> 00:18:16,863
You could find another job,
maybe somewhere else than here.

95
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:19,265
Where? And do what?

96
00:18:19,449 --> 00:18:21,776
Don't you have a dream?

97
00:18:21,876 --> 00:18:25,438
Yes! I'd like become translator
in a publishing house.

98
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,558
Come on! Cool!

99
00:18:26,581 --> 00:18:30,635
See, maybe you will find your way somewhere.

100
00:18:32,086 --> 00:18:34,172
And then what happens?

101
00:18:34,372 --> 00:18:37,700
Do you believe that happiness
is deserting your home?

102
00:18:38,301 --> 00:18:39,741
And for what then?

103
00:18:39,802 --> 00:18:40,803
For yourself!

104
00:18:40,803 --> 00:18:42,870
For your file, for your future!

105
00:18:43,006 --> 00:18:44,006
No.

106
00:18:44,532 --> 00:18:46,960
I believe that deserting your own country

107
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,388
is like deserting your origin and your identity.

108
00:18:54,192 --> 00:18:55,992
What are you doing tonight?

109
00:18:57,111 --> 00:18:59,844
I must finish a translation for a friend,

110
00:18:59,948 --> 00:19:02,681
but we can meet after dinner if you want.

111
00:19:02,992 --> 00:19:03,992
Okay.

112
00:19:04,252 --> 00:19:06,821
Will you take me to a typical Russian place?

113
00:19:06,821 --> 00:19:07,821
Yes.

114
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:13,019
- I'll make you drink real, plain vodka.
- Okay, I'm in.

115
00:19:27,456 --> 00:19:31,808
<i>"After my father died,
my mother fell into a serious depression."</i>

116
00:20:18,239 --> 00:20:22,747
<i>The evildoers want to take
the inheritance of the girlâ€™s family,</i>

117
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:25,089
<i>destroying their whole history.</i>

118
00:20:27,744 --> 00:20:32,544
<i>"I fell into a mysterious lethargy
that did not alter my consciousness."</i>

119
00:20:40,982 --> 00:20:46,721
But what do people do here after dinner
aside from drinking plain vodka?

120
00:20:46,921 --> 00:20:48,721
Massimo that's prejudicial.

121
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:52,711
Then in Italy you only eat pizza
and play mandolin with the mafia...

122
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:56,359
Stop it, I understood! Jesus!
Russians, how proud you are.

123
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,456
Russians, how proud you are!

124
00:21:00,318 --> 00:21:01,518
Do you hear it?

125
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:03,903
- It's music!
- Yeah!

126
00:21:04,956 --> 00:21:06,483
Shall we climb over?

127
00:21:06,483 --> 00:21:08,910
No, are you crazy? It's private property!

128
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,270
That is nonsense!

129
00:21:10,987 --> 00:21:14,379
I know why you say this.
It's because you can't do it.

130
00:21:14,415 --> 00:21:16,635
Of course I can do it. I can't climb over a gate?

131
00:21:16,635 --> 00:21:18,069
Maybe you can't do it.

132
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:20,497
I don't think you realize
who you are dealing with.

133
00:21:20,497 --> 00:21:21,497
Grab this!

134
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,031
No, Massimo.

135
00:21:26,961 --> 00:21:30,161
Do you see? You can't do it,
I told you! Come down!

136
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,416
Italian!

137
00:21:34,402 --> 00:21:35,682
Help me, though!

138
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:41,048
Can you see anything? What's there?

139
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:42,855
No, there is nothing!

140
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:47,906
Sorry!

141
00:22:01,162 --> 00:22:02,842
Your clothes are dirty.

142
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,600
No, Massimo!

143
00:24:01,074 --> 00:24:03,850
Italian guy, espresso coffee?

144
00:24:13,574 --> 00:24:14,614
Espresso, uh?

145
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:16,214
Isn't it okay?

146
00:24:16,214 --> 00:24:18,383
You wouldn't drink coffee,
would you drink cappuccino?

147
00:24:18,383 --> 00:24:21,967
- I can make cappuccino too.
- No, it's okay, thank you!

148
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:24,881
But next time I'll make cappuccino.

149
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:45,927
When I was a child,
my parents used to bring me here.

150
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,693
I have wonderful memories.

151
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:51,779
Sometimes I come back here
when things start getting bad.

152
00:24:54,385 --> 00:24:56,185
Where are your parents now?

153
00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:00,641
My mother is here, my father isn't here anymore.

154
00:25:01,142 --> 00:25:04,214
He ran away with another woman when I was child.

155
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:07,070
I've never heard from him since then.

156
00:25:08,566 --> 00:25:12,534
He used to call me for my birthday,
but recently not even that.

157
00:25:13,863 --> 00:25:19,026
My mother is very ill,
she needs very expensive treatments.

158
00:25:19,326 --> 00:25:22,462
This is why I cannot leave, I must stay with her.

159
00:25:23,664 --> 00:25:26,625
So, when I feel sad and want to flee the situation

160
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:30,663
I come here, sit on these couches
and start traveling.

161
00:25:32,256 --> 00:25:35,025
Well, at least the ticket is cheap.

162
00:26:58,126 --> 00:27:02,286
I've had few love stories in my live,
and they all ended up badly.

163
00:27:04,807 --> 00:27:08,327
Someone said that you fall in love
once in your lifetime

164
00:27:08,953 --> 00:27:10,820
but I don't think it's true.

165
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:13,782
I thought that all was over

166
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,949
that I missed the train of love

167
00:27:16,277 --> 00:27:17,557
but I was wrong.

168
00:27:19,488 --> 00:27:22,560
We are surrounded by people who want to be loved

169
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:25,441
and people who are willing to love us.

170
00:27:26,203 --> 00:27:29,979
We only need to keep in mind
that everything starts from us.

171
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:53,380
We are energy and so we attract
situations and people.

172
00:27:56,192 --> 00:27:59,059
Energy is not created, nor is it destroyed.

173
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:00,948
Everything changes.

174
00:28:01,864 --> 00:28:05,512
And I needed to transform myself
into something better too

175
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,552
and that was happening, thanks to Vladimir.

176
00:28:28,566 --> 00:28:30,299
<i>"...to me, Maciste! Help!"</i>

177
00:29:08,756 --> 00:29:10,791
...really, is it true?

178
00:29:11,191 --> 00:29:12,318
This is wonderful!

179
00:29:12,318 --> 00:29:14,095
Yes. It takes me a lot of time.

180
00:29:14,095 --> 00:29:15,638
In fact it seems very difficult.

181
00:29:15,638 --> 00:29:17,078
How did you do it?

182
00:29:19,909 --> 00:29:20,909
Here.

183
00:29:20,935 --> 00:29:21,935
No, really!

184
00:29:26,557 --> 00:29:27,557
Thank you.

185
00:29:54,587 --> 00:29:58,414
â™ª Some people get lost â™ª

186
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:05,754
â™ª Some people can't see â™ª

187
00:30:08,148 --> 00:30:12,678
â™ª Some will live his life searching
for the right clue â™ª

188
00:30:13,829 --> 00:30:18,658
â™ª Hope someone is you â™ª

189
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:25,715
â™ª I collected few precious days â™ª

190
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:33,490
â™ª They slip through my fingers
like candy in a lake â™ª

191
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:38,720
â™ª What's point of living like a king
with a would you never share â™ª

192
00:30:40,856 --> 00:30:44,442
â™ª Nothing matters there â™ª

193
00:30:46,252 --> 00:30:50,883
â™ª And I can't quit with the faith in life â™ª

194
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:58,273
â™ª I can't crawl the space and time â™ª

195
00:30:58,374 --> 00:31:03,320
â™ª I can't die... â™ª

196
00:31:03,879 --> 00:31:11,195
â™ª Just to be close to you tonight â™ª

197
00:31:14,723 --> 00:31:19,802
â™ª It's a well known story â™ª

198
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:26,919
â™ª Too much pressure, always make you pout â™ª

199
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:33,325
â™ª Keep yourself every minutes every day
just by sitting in the soft couch â™ª

200
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:36,954
â™ª Can't you see I'm here â™ª

201
00:31:36,954 --> 00:31:39,064
â™ª It's me â™ª

202
00:31:41,842 --> 00:31:46,871
â™ª I was afraid of my shadow â™ª

203
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:51,592
â™ª I was learnt to keep the treasure safe â™ª

204
00:31:51,718 --> 00:31:54,585
â™ª Is always the life I'm supposed to live â™ª

205
00:31:54,796 --> 00:32:00,060
â™ª Change the color of the skin makes it
not the cell to be the one you were â™ª

206
00:32:00,686 --> 00:32:05,983
â™ª But live, live â™ª

207
00:32:06,934 --> 00:32:12,314
â™ª And I quit with the faith in live â™ª

208
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:18,971
â™ª I can't crawl the space and time â™ª

209
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:25,302
â™ª I can't die... â™ª

210
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:30,883
â™ª Just to be close to you â™ª

211
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:34,011
â™ª Tonight â™ª

212
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:39,875
â™ª Tonight â™ª

213
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:47,232
â™ª Tonight â™ª

214
00:32:48,459 --> 00:32:53,489
â™ª Tonight â™ª

215
00:34:17,982 --> 00:34:21,968
<i>In such a situation again.</i>

216
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,040
<i>I was in love.</i>

217
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,292
<i>We were beyond space and time.</i>

218
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:31,354
<i>In an independent place, not mine, not his.</i>

219
00:34:31,378 --> 00:34:32,418
<i>Totally ours.</i>

220
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:37,909
<i>I remember that there were no barriers or limits.</i>

221
00:34:38,594 --> 00:34:41,327
<i>We were connected. Glances would suffice.</i>

222
00:43:42,754 --> 00:43:47,601
<i>You have to fight to get what you love.</i>

223
00:44:26,462 --> 00:44:29,894
<i>Maciste hired to find the girl.</i>

224
00:44:50,305 --> 00:44:53,958
<i>But the way to go isn't always easy.</i>

225
00:45:48,004 --> 00:45:51,291
<i>We are prisoners of our beliefs.</i>

226
00:45:52,976 --> 00:45:54,627
Your family know about you?

227
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:55,627
Yes.

228
00:45:56,104 --> 00:45:57,971
It has been a few years now.

229
00:45:59,816 --> 00:46:02,310
I told my brother first.

230
00:46:04,404 --> 00:46:05,764
We were so drunk.

231
00:46:07,715 --> 00:46:11,491
But you know, I thought it was
the right moment to tell him,

232
00:46:11,828 --> 00:46:12,828
so I did it.

233
00:46:12,987 --> 00:46:14,107
How did it go?

234
00:46:15,373 --> 00:46:18,392
Very well. I couldnâ€™t believe it.

235
00:46:20,837 --> 00:46:21,837
You know,

236
00:46:22,171 --> 00:46:24,704
I think that people who truly love you

237
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:29,727
will eventually appreciate the effort you make
in telling them who you are.

238
00:46:30,463 --> 00:46:33,727
And then one day,
they will be even grateful to you.

239
00:46:35,643 --> 00:46:36,643
Your mother?

240
00:46:38,312 --> 00:46:39,432
Does she know?

241
00:46:40,314 --> 00:46:42,767
No, are you crazy? I could never tell her.

242
00:46:42,767 --> 00:46:47,172
Most of all she doesn't deserve this now
with all she is going through.

243
00:46:47,196 --> 00:46:50,908
Well, I think this is exactly
the right moment to tell her.

244
00:46:51,951 --> 00:46:53,631
And she already knows.

245
00:46:54,428 --> 00:46:56,028
Mothers always know.

246
00:46:57,665 --> 00:47:01,369
I don't know, and if I lack the courage?

247
00:47:01,369 --> 00:47:04,881
And I think about her reaction.
What if she didn't understand? What should I do?

248
00:47:04,881 --> 00:47:07,175
Come on, she will understand, you'll see.

249
00:47:07,175 --> 00:47:10,042
Just wait for the right moment to tell her.

250
00:47:11,904 --> 00:47:15,049
See, I think that we must be honest and genuine

251
00:47:15,049 --> 00:47:16,751
with the people who love us.

252
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:19,913
Yes, maybe, but we are not in Italy here, Massimo.

253
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:21,081
We're in Russia.

254
00:47:21,105 --> 00:47:25,905
Today hatred has prevailed and moreover fear
has increased since Putin's law.

255
00:47:25,985 --> 00:47:28,763
There are homophobic groups
who wait in ambush for gay people

256
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:31,496
only to beat them up and see their blood.

257
00:47:32,366 --> 00:47:36,206
Respect comes from the mind,
but hatred comes from the heart.

258
00:47:36,287 --> 00:47:38,706
No feeling is completely under our own control.

259
00:47:38,706 --> 00:47:40,906
But I think that we need to fight

260
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:43,966
- in order to change things and be free.
- Free?

261
00:47:45,046 --> 00:47:47,849
You talk of freedom,
you don't even know what freedom really is!

262
00:47:47,849 --> 00:47:51,469
We're afraid to leave home,
afraid that someone might follow us.

263
00:47:51,469 --> 00:47:54,541
Anxiety and panic attacks are an everyday story.

264
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:55,622
I...

265
00:47:55,640 --> 00:48:00,011
I wake up at night and can't sleep like before.
I'm even scared of my own shadow.

266
00:48:00,011 --> 00:48:05,003
And you come and talk to me about freedom!
You don't even know what freedom is!

267
00:48:07,777 --> 00:48:08,777
I'm sorry.

268
00:48:12,073 --> 00:48:13,873
I didn't want to judge you.

269
00:48:22,434 --> 00:48:23,434
Hey, listen

270
00:48:23,668 --> 00:48:25,853
I'm starving, aren't you?

271
00:48:25,853 --> 00:48:27,720
Shall we have a bite to eat?

272
00:48:29,173 --> 00:48:30,173
Well, okay.

273
00:48:31,025 --> 00:48:34,321
And maybe this headache I've had
since this morning will cease.

274
00:48:34,345 --> 00:48:36,145
You made me drink too much!

275
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:39,642
Me? You didn't want to put the bottle down!

276
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:45,097
Sorry if I didn't put the bottle down.

277
00:48:45,097 --> 00:48:48,985
Evidently I have been charmed
by the true Russian vodka.

278
00:48:51,404 --> 00:48:53,623
You know nothing about St. Pertersburg, do you?

279
00:48:53,623 --> 00:48:55,158
Did you manage to have a tour?

280
00:48:55,158 --> 00:48:57,943
No, I had no time.

281
00:48:58,369 --> 00:49:00,846
Today is my only day off

282
00:49:00,946 --> 00:49:03,413
and tomorrow I'm going back to Italy.

283
00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:07,247
Well you can't leave
without visiting the city then!

284
00:49:21,577 --> 00:49:23,903
<i>The Church of he Saviour on Spilled Blood</i>

285
00:49:23,903 --> 00:49:26,975
<i>is the famous building linked to St. Petersburg.</i>

286
00:49:28,858 --> 00:49:32,153
<i>Inside it there are no religious paintings,
only mosaics.</i>

287
00:49:32,153 --> 00:49:35,993
<i>Religious paintings were prohibited
during the Soviet period.</i>

288
00:49:37,033 --> 00:49:41,321
<i>The mosaics are wonderful.
You must visit it the next time you come.</i>

289
00:49:45,833 --> 00:49:47,919
<i>You Italians have so many things</i>

290
00:49:47,919 --> 00:49:50,052
<i>but no city like St. Petersburg.</i>

291
00:49:52,006 --> 00:49:54,458
<i>Ah, there is St. Isaac</i>

292
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:56,786
<i>the city's most important cathedral.</i>

293
00:49:56,786 --> 00:49:59,586
<i>You can enjoy a wonderful view from there!</i>

294
00:51:31,183 --> 00:51:35,407
<i>If you want to have an idea of the city,
you must  take a boat ride</i>

295
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:40,354
<i>especially if you do not have much time.
You'll see the most important places.</i>

296
00:51:41,244 --> 00:51:44,144
<i>There is a bridge called the Bridge of Kisses</i>

297
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:49,557
<i>because lovers think that kissing
under this bridge will bond them forever.</i>

298
00:51:49,657 --> 00:51:50,657
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

299
00:52:26,469 --> 00:52:28,521
<i>There is a movable bridge</i>

300
00:52:28,821 --> 00:52:30,265
<i>symbol of the city.</i>

301
00:52:30,289 --> 00:52:33,875
<i>In 2010, a group of artists</i>

302
00:52:33,885 --> 00:52:37,405
<i>did something that did not please
the Russian leaders...</i>

303
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:39,832
<i>An action against the Russian system.</i>

304
00:52:39,832 --> 00:52:43,494
<i>Well, I don't agree
with this kind of demonstration.</i>

305
00:56:06,855 --> 00:56:08,949
Putin is not who you think, you know?

306
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:10,882
He did some good things, too.

307
00:56:10,884 --> 00:56:11,884
Yeah?

308
00:56:12,553 --> 00:56:13,553
Like what?

309
00:56:14,113 --> 00:56:16,557
For example, he avoided the war in Syria.

310
00:56:16,557 --> 00:56:19,157
And dismantled Hassad chemical weapons.

311
00:56:19,993 --> 00:56:21,770
You know what the true problem is?

312
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:23,050
The Nobel Prize.

313
00:56:23,664 --> 00:56:25,941
No politician should win a Nobel Prize,

314
00:56:25,941 --> 00:56:28,085
every politician defends his own interests.

315
00:56:28,085 --> 00:56:29,170
Think about Obama,

316
00:56:29,194 --> 00:56:31,394
he won the Nobel Prize for peace.

317
00:56:31,488 --> 00:56:32,488
Obama?

318
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:37,077
He has continued the war
that Bush started in Iraq and Afghanistan

319
00:56:37,077 --> 00:56:40,205
and who triggered
the war in Libya one year before.

320
00:56:40,205 --> 00:56:41,725
Yeah, you're right.

321
00:56:42,241 --> 00:56:45,441
We must not allow others to take our own identity.

322
00:56:45,919 --> 00:56:48,422
Our people are ready to die for an ideal

323
00:56:48,422 --> 00:56:50,222
and if you are ready to do,

324
00:56:50,382 --> 00:56:53,582
so I think you'll see the results sooner or later.

325
00:56:54,094 --> 00:56:56,961
We must never accept dreams from strangers.

326
00:58:03,614 --> 00:58:07,518
<i>That night I wasn't hurt
by the punches and kicks they gave us</i>

327
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:11,380
<i>but by the hatred imprisoned inside poor men.</i>

328
00:58:12,448 --> 00:58:13,448
<i>Not even men</i>

329
00:58:14,366 --> 00:58:15,366
<i>but beasts.</i>

330
00:58:17,602 --> 00:58:19,922
<i>Homophobia is like a virus</i>

331
00:58:20,022 --> 00:58:21,702
<i>which first infects cells</i>

332
00:58:22,157 --> 00:58:23,837
<i>and then the entire body</i>

333
00:58:24,727 --> 00:58:26,487
<i>up to the brain.</i>

334
00:58:36,856 --> 00:58:40,676
<i>That was the last time I saw Vladimir.</i>

335
00:59:53,005 --> 01:00:00,933
<i>Great deeds do not require force but perseverance.</i>

336
01:00:17,698 --> 01:00:21,034
<i>There are people in life
that give you something you won't forget.</i>

337
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:25,247
<i>Even if you have met them for a short time
you will keep them inside your heart</i>

338
01:00:25,247 --> 01:00:27,266
<i>forever by your side.</i>

339
01:00:55,728 --> 01:00:58,105
<i>Vladimir is a genuine person</i>

340
01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:00,830
<i>not afraid to say what he thinks.</i>

341
01:01:02,134 --> 01:01:05,888
<i>Sometime it is easier to believe
in the image that others have of us</i>

342
01:01:05,888 --> 01:01:08,288
<i>rather than accept who we truly are.</i>

343
01:01:25,983 --> 01:01:27,983
<i>I still remember that morning.</i>

<i>Autumn was about to come.</i>

345
01:01:31,638 --> 01:01:35,951
<i>I had sent messages,
friend requests in social networks</i>

346
01:01:36,719 --> 01:01:37,719
<i>to no avail.</i>

347
01:01:42,424 --> 01:01:44,635
<i>And then I read that letter.</i>

348
01:01:46,136 --> 01:01:48,931
<i>It was the letter of a man who had suffered</i>

349
01:01:48,931 --> 01:01:55,320
<i>as if time couldn't destroy that feeling
which does not allow us to love freely.</i>

350
01:02:12,004 --> 01:02:13,364
<i>Â« My dearest boy.</i>

351
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:17,601
<i>This will assure you of my immortal,</i>

352
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:19,581
<i>my eternal love for you.</i>

353
01:02:20,879 --> 01:02:22,612
<i>Tomorrow all will be over.</i>

354
01:02:24,049 --> 01:02:26,916
<i>If prison and dishonor shall be my destiny,</i>

355
01:02:27,402 --> 01:02:30,422
<i>think that my love for you and this idea</i>

356
01:02:30,722 --> 01:02:35,010
<i>this even more divine belief
that you love me in return</i>

357
01:02:35,769 --> 01:02:37,969
<i>will sustain me in my unhappiness</i>

358
01:02:38,438 --> 01:02:40,571
<i>and will make me capable, I hope</i>

359
01:02:41,124 --> 01:02:44,302
<i>of bearing my grief most patiently.</i>

360
01:02:46,571 --> 01:02:47,940
<i>Since the hope</i>

361
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:52,016
<i>no, rather the certainty
of meeting you again in some world</i>

362
01:02:52,035 --> 01:02:55,363
<i>is the goal and the encouragement
of my present life.</i>

363
01:02:55,956 --> 01:02:59,893
<i>I must continue to live
in this world because of that.</i>

364
01:03:03,138 --> 01:03:05,805
<i>Your love has broad wings and is strong.</i>

365
01:03:05,924 --> 01:03:08,524
<i>Your love is the light of all my hours.</i>

366
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:13,360
<i>If fate is against us,</i>

367
01:03:13,707 --> 01:03:17,444
<i>those who know not what love is will write,</i>

368
01:03:17,644 --> 01:03:21,036
<i>I know that I have had
a bad influence upon your life.</i>

369
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,720
<i>If they do that,</i>

370
01:03:22,941 --> 01:03:24,141
<i>you shall write,</i>

371
01:03:24,651 --> 01:03:27,595
<i>you shall say in your turn, that it is not so.</i>

372
01:03:28,597 --> 01:03:31,197
<i>Our love was always beautiful and noble</i>

373
01:03:31,783 --> 01:03:35,047
<i>and if I have been the victim
of a terrible tragedy,</i>

374
01:03:35,103 --> 01:03:39,007
<i>it is because the nature of that love
has not been understood.</i>

375
01:03:42,344 --> 01:03:46,782
<i>In your letter this morning,
you said something which gives me courage.</i>

376
01:03:46,782 --> 01:03:48,302
<i>I must remember it.</i>

377
01:03:49,384 --> 01:03:53,372
<i>You write that it is my duty to you
and to myself to live</i>

378
01:03:53,572 --> 01:03:55,252
<i>in spite of everything.</i>

379
01:03:56,641 --> 01:03:58,321
<i>I think that is true.</i>

380
01:03:58,727 --> 01:04:00,727
<i>I shall try and I shall do it.</i>

381
01:04:03,523 --> 01:04:06,027
<i>I am so happy that you have gone away,</i>

382
01:04:06,051 --> 01:04:08,451
<i>I know what that must have cost you.</i>

383
01:04:08,904 --> 01:04:11,189
<i>I stretch out my hands towards you.</i>

384
01:04:11,189 --> 01:04:14,325
<i>Oh, may I live to touch your hair and your hands.</i>

385
01:04:16,286 --> 01:04:19,294
<i>I think that your love will watch over my life.</i>

386
01:04:20,290 --> 01:04:21,742
<i>If I should die,</i>

387
01:04:22,042 --> 01:04:25,420
<i>I want you to live a gentle,
peaceful existence somewhere</i>

388
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:26,471

392
01:04:32,619 --> 01:04:34,819
<i>Try to let me hear from you soon.</i>

393
01:04:36,807 --> 01:04:40,647
<i>I am writing you this letter
in the midst of great suffering.</i>

<i>Wait for me?</i>

399
01:04:53,348 --> 01:04:54,516
<i>I am</i>

400
01:04:54,516 --> 01:04:57,116
<i>and have been ever since the day we met</i>

401
01:04:57,702 --> 01:04:59,287
