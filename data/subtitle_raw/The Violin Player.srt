1
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,150
We all have two lives.

2
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:22,170
The second life begins when we
realize that we only have one.

3
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:27,220
Confucius 479BC.

4
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,030
Here we stand smoking.

5
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,200
As so often.

6
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,200
They leave us in peace.

7
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,130
We have stood outside and
smoked for 5 years now.

8
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,170
- Good luck. 
- See you soon.

9
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,090
- Are you ready? 
- Yes.

10
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,010
- You are beautiful. 
- Thanks.

11
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:38,150
- Sorry. 
- It's okay.

12
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,240
Leave it be.

13
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:57,030
OMG. Now let it just be.

14
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,190
Ok.

15
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,210
Breathe.

16
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,010
It is wonderful to work with you again.

17
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,130
I've missed it.

18
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,080
I can hardly believe that the tour has ended.

19
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,200
You can go with your family
to the summer cottage.

20
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,990
It's nice to be with family once in a while.

21
00:03:56,114 --> 00:03:57,169
Yes of course.

22
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,110
- Let me take you to the hotel. 
- No, it's not necessary.

23
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,040
- I'll drive you. 
- No, I'll walk, I need fresh air.

24
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,100
I'm really happy for you.

25
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,150
- Take care of yourself. 
- You too.

26
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,170
Goodbye. Bjorn?

27
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,200
Yes.

28
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,210
It should be okay.

29
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,130
No. Do not worry.

30
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:26,120
I promise ...

31
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,090
I'll take care of it ...

32
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,060
Karin!

33
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,180
Call an ambulance!

34
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:04,100
The VIOLINIST

35
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,010
- Can you feel anything? 
- No.

36
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,240
- And now? 
- No.

37
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:03,040
- And here? 
- No.

38
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,100
Your fingers are still numb.

39
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,230
Sorry, I could not find the thicker needles.

40
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,150
Just a moment.

41
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:16,130
These are the green. You have to find the red.

42
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:20,090
Check out the top shelf. Thank you.

43
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,030
The accident destroyed a joint in your hand ...

44
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,180
... as well as the nerves in these three fingers.

45
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:57,080
- Can you operate again? 
- We have done everything we could.

46
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,100
Karin. Where are my glasses?

47
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:03,010
Eemeli. Your phone.

48
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:06,040
- I am leaving now. 
- Goodbye.

49
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,210
Goodbye!

50
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,180
Where is my phone?

51
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:14,240
Karin. Where are my glasses?

52
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:18,180
Well, yes, I left them there yesterday.

53
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,150
Karin.

54
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,070
How long will you go on like this?

55
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:44,140
Maybe you should accept what the experts say.

56
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:51,130
- You just want me to stay at home.
- No, sweetheart ...

57
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,200
Honey, let me help you.

58
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,170
If you will not accept my help ...

59
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:02,140
Karin, what do you want me to do?

60
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:08,090
This has been going on for eight months. 
You do not have to do anything.

61
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:13,090
Doctors have said that you
have damaged three fingers.

62
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:17,020
-You don't even know them! 
- That does not matter.

63
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,140
A top surgeon said that the nerves are dead!

64
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,170
- Accept it. 
- I'm not going to start teaching!

65
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:26,230
I'm not a teacher, I am an artist!

66
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:43,030
Thank you for coming on such short notice.

67
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:47,020
Students who graduate this year are fantastic.

68
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,150
I heard that you have been selected as
one of the world's finest art academies.

69
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:54,180
- Congratulations. 
- That's right. Thanks.

70
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,110
How's your hand?

71
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,040
Well, it is completely ...

72
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,180
The entertainment is simple but ingenious.

73
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:08,000
The structures are simple
and symmetrical shapes.

74
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,010
- And Mozart ... 
- Hello!

75
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,160
Sorry. It's my fault.

76
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,170
Sofia, hello. Sorry I'm late.

77
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:18,160
Welcome. We've been waiting for you.

78
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:23,080
Mozart composed this in
Italy when he was fifteen.

79
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,050
It is the source of melody and drama.

80
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:29,230
I have read Mozart's letters.

81
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:35,030
He lived a hard life in poverty and misery.

82
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,130
But it was his own choice.

83
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:40,190
He had the opportunity to work for the Church.

84
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:45,010
It's a way to look at it.
It's about perseverance.

85
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:48,160
He did not want outsiders to affect his work.

86
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,160
- Why haven't you wokene me? 
- I'm not your mother.

87
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,170
Before we start, let's make one thing clear:

88
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,140
You must not be late.

89
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:03,030
If you know you'll be late, you should not come.

90
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,220
Keep this in mind for next time.

91
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,110
Feel free to play.

92
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,170
Great, it was beautiful.

93
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:33,200
A little soft at the end of phrases.
It's not allegro amabile

94
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,100
but allegro con brio.

95
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:39,150
Play again from the 22nd bar.

96
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:43,040
The first violinist begins and the other follow.

97
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:57,170
You have energy, but try playing
together. Communicate more.

98
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:02,020
Add more flirting. It's an opera. A love story.

99
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,640
Let's go again.

100
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,090
Karin!

101
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,150
I do not know why I have
to run after those scores,

102
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:48,000
but the situation is as it is.

103
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,180
If you don't have the scores, 
you'll have to order them.

104
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:56,030
It is impossible for tomorrow. They are lent out.

105
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:59,140
I don't care how you do it.

106
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:03,100
But I need Henles Urtext edition tomorrow.

107
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:06,070
Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto in E minor.

108
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,170
- Excuse me. - Hello, Karin.

109
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:11,020
Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto?

110
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,230
I have it. If you need it tomorrow, I can ...

111
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,010
It would be very kind of you.

112
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:20,130
I'm busy today, but Antti can drop it.

113
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,010
Right?

114
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:25,110
Yes, of course.

115
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:28,020
- Excellent. See you later. 
- Thanks.

116
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,230
I mean goodbye.

117
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:33,190
Why did I say "thank you"? 
I'm going to Pilates today.

118
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:36,060
Stop it.

119
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:41,010
I know I have not conducted in a few years.

120
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:46,140
But I have good credentials.

121
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,020
and ...

122
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:56,190
I just need to meet them ...

123
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,070
What?

124
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,210
What do you mean I can't
get an invitation there?

125
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,210
Have you been in contact with them?

126
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:17,060
Linda, good contacts are everything.

127
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,020
Linda, you're my agent, you should know that.

128
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,010
You can sit down.

129
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,180
Only one of my students. Damn it.

130
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:32,110
We'll talk later, okay?

131
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,200
You too. Goodbye.

132
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:41,170
- Thanks for the scores. 
- You are welcome.

133
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:46,620
It's funny. We've played it with
Puumala the whole of last year.

134
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,050
Is that a ...?

135
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,070
Yes.

136
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:09,130
I've never touched a Stradivarius.

137
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,220
Can I try it?

138
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,120
My contract forbids me to let anyone touch it.

139
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,030
There are not many like that in Finland.

140
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:42,140
It is insured for four million euros.

141
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,010
Here.

142
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:14,080
Here you are.

143
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,010
Now?

144
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:22,050
Haven't you said that you've
played the whole of last year?

145
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,240
It's been a while ago.

146
00:16:39,822 --> 00:16:41,322
Whoops!

147
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:34,060
Don't worry.
It takes time to get used to a Stradivarius.

148
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,090
You should not push it, otherwise it stops.

149
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:41,130
But once you've found the delicate technique ...

150
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:46,050
It shows its depth.

151
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:00,060
It;s somehow so romantic.

152
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,100
Don't you think it's ...

153
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:08,070
... almost too romantic?

154
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:29,000
Hey!

155
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:32,140
This is Antti, my student.

156
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,090
Hi.

157
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:38,000
You could have asked me to
go to the parents' meeting.

158
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,160
Why stay home if you do
not want to attend anything?

159
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,030
I should probably go.

160
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,600
You can stay and dine. I will cook lobster soup.

161
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,120
I have already eaten.

162
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,160
What is it? Does it taste so bad?

163
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:16,080
- Is it so awful? 
- I have something in my throat.

164
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:19,220
Have you seasoned it in a different way?

165
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,010
I've tried making it without cookbook.

166
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,160
It's terrible.

167
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,220
Yes, it tastes quite strange.

168
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,150
- I think it's good. 
- That's nice.

169
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,180
- Damn! Sorry ... 
- Never mind. It will dry up.

170
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,080
Everything is alright.

171
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,200
Everything is fine.

172
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:55,070
What is it, Karin?

173
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,090
What is it?

174
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:03,050
Can't you at least look at me?

175
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,070
What?

176
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:17,230
Everything is breaking down.

177
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:23,050
It will be alright.

178
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,200
Hi.

179
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:45,070
- Can you be a little quieter? 
- Excuse me.

180
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,060
Alright.

181
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:04,090
I've found this brilliant recording of "Requiem" 

182
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,210
From Sarajevo, 1994.

183
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,150
Do you want to hear it?

184
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,170
What do you think?

185
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:44,110
I think about the movie when I listen to this.

186
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:48,150
- That ruined the song for me.
- I think it's a good movie.

187
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:52,120
I saw it for the first time when I
was eight, it was cold at the time.

188
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:58,160
Since then it has been a tradition
to watch it whenever I have a cold.

189
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,130
- Are you sick now? - No, I'm not cold.

190
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,070
I don't watch the movie,
I just listen to the music now.

191
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,180
I love that scene

192
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,140
where he dictates this piece
on his deathbed, note for note.

193
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,120
He was a big star then, that actor.

194
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,210
I wonder what happened to him.

195
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,210
How's Mendelssohn?

196
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,150
Really good.

197
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:34,030
Please, can't you get dressed?
I can not concentrate.

198
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,190
I need to work on this.

199
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:05,220
- You've played it for seven hours.
- I can play for seven hours.

200
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,180
Certainly.

201
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:20,150
You should not start vacuuming while I practice!

202
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,060
- Sofia! - What?

203
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,000
- Turn it off! - No, I will not.

204
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:46,040
Good. Play it again. at a slower pace.

205
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:49,150
Try to get more articulation in terses.

206
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:06,140
Now, let's raise the bar a little bit.

207
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:09,160
You can play this even with eyes closed

208
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,210
- so you do not have to worry
about how your fingers move.

209
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,060
Try to see the bigger picture now.

210
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,080
Close your eyes.

211
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:23,150
And imagine the piece ...

212
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,240
... as if it was a huge,
incredibly beautiful building.

213
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:32,210
See the big picture

214
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,150
and play without thinking about anything else.

215
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:37,070
The same part.

216
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:02,090
Good. The phrases were longer

217
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:07,050
but when I took notes,
you were a little tense again.

218
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:10,160
Just relax, no matter how nervous you are.

219
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,010
Give me your elbow.

220
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:15,170
Press it against my hand.

221
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:18,200
Play now, and press firmly against the bow.

222
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,140
Relax.

223
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,220
Just relax.

224
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,020
It sounds terrible, but just be relaxed.

225
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,230
It does not help. Okay, good.

226
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,150
Just like that!

227
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:40,100
Do not be afraid that it sounds bad.

228
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,120
It's not that I'm afraid of.

229
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,090
What are you afraid of, then?

230
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,140
Mediocrity.

231
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,120
Then you're like Mendelssohn.

232
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:01,040
A friend of mine said that
Mendelssohn was unsuccessful -

233
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,230
- because he was too talented.

234
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,080
Perhaps he also suffered from fear of mediocrity.

235
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:11,030
Did you hurt your hand?

236
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,190
The scar was already there.

237
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:39,220
Would you sign here?

238
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,060
It's just a formality.

239
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,090
Now that your scholarship
period has been interrupted.

240
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,120
Thanks.

241
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:51,610
Well then.

242
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:53,600
Good...

243
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:57,030
Then I'm leaving. Thank you.

244
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,020
This is a little embarrassing, but ...

245
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,230
Can I see it one last time?

246
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:18,010
Yes, of course.

247
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,060
In my work I have seen -

248
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:41,180
- that people can become
more attached to objects -

249
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:44,020
- than other people.

250
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:49,140
It's the music.

251
00:29:55,170 --> 00:30:05,110
Happy Birthday

252
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:11,560
Happy birthday, dear Karin

253
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:20,090
Happy Birthday

254
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:27,190
A master chef told me once
that his taste is so developed -

255
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:31,090
- that he can taste different
flavors in his thoughts -

256
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:35,130
- and then combine the sensations in his head.

257
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:40,030
- Without eating.
What are you gonna do now, Karin?

258
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:43,520
I'll be conducting again.

259
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,140
My agent says that everything seems fine.

260
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:49,190
What do you do when nothing is enough?
- I heard that!

261
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:52,050
I meant when everything goes well.

262
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:26,020
I've realized something.

263
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:29,220
Karin, we are very much alike, you and me.

264
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:33,020
We are not content with
anything less than success.

265
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:36,000
- Are you going home now?
- Yes. What the hell am I doing here?

266
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,830
- Here are just old ladies.
- I've been looking for you.

267
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,200
- Nonsense. - Yes, I did.

268
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,180
You have flirted with that Swede.

269
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,150
You're completely crazy. - You deny?

270
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:49,060
It's so cool that you're our teacher.

271
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,100
I think you are absolutely fantastic.

272
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,070
Some people think that high culture is dead -

273
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:59,030
- and that food and drink
has replaced art in our lives.

274
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,050
Food has already become a religion.

275
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:05,220
- It's crazy. - Come and dance with me.

276
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:10,080
I'm coming, darling. Just a moment.

277
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,030
Is everything OK?

278
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:30,200
I just need that meeting.

279
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:36,030
I know that I'm not a famous conductor.

280
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:42,120
Linda, should I change agent?

281
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:47,100
I have to go now. Goodbye.

282
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:45,170
Hello. Do you have something to say?

283
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:51,050
I just want to explain
what happened at the party.

284
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,130
I apologize.

285
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:12,000
I am still your teacher.

286
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:14,220
And I am your student.

287
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:25,020
- I'm 45. - And I'm 27.

288
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:29,020
Hi.

289
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:37,120
Thanks. The taxi is waiting outside.

290
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:43,030
Excuse me, is Jaakko there?
Excuse me, who are you?

291
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:45,070
Karin Nordstrom.

292
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:49,050
- Jaakko's wife.
Excuse me, I did not recognize you.

293
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,040
Of course.

294
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,230
Hi.

295
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:55,110
- Hello. - Hello!

296
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:58,170
- Were you surprised? - What are you doing here?

297
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,080
I brought this for you.

298
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,130
- For me? - Yes.

299
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:06,230
-Why? - No reason.

300
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,000
Isn't it a nice color?

301
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,130
I'll try it. - Okay.

302
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:57,010
There must be more to
life than playing the violin.

303
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:00,090
- Okay. - I mean...

304
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:04,050
Being a successful musician
does not mean everything to me.

305
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:08,030
I have other dreams too. Just like you.

306
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:12,040
You have managed to combine family and career.

307
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,180
I do not want everything to
revolve only around music -

308
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:21,020
- and not have anything else in my life.

309
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:27,120
You know...

310
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:31,030
My father used to say that
I have a violinist's fingers.

311
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:35,520
That with a lot of practice,
I could be the next Karin Nordstrom.

312
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:38,150
Well.

313
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,050
It's funny.

314
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:45,100
I am your admirer.

315
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:49,030
I admire you, and now you're here.

316
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:51,150
It's strange.

317
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:54,210
Both Antti and I admire you.

318
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:58,150
We talk about you all the time. Or Antti does.

319
00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:02,010
"Karin did this, Karin did that."

320
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:04,160
"Karin is so beautiful."

321
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:10,060
"Karin is so brave, successful and gifted."

322
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:13,060
Which is true, but it's weird.

323
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,190
He does it all the time.

324
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:21,080
Do you ever speak about us with Jaakko?

325
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,140
I mean at home. -No.

326
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:27,130
I speak of course of my students at home.

327
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:31,100
There is something I want to tell you, Sophia.

328
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:48,080
My job as your teacher is to
say that music is everything -

329
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:53,150
-but that does not mean
you are not entitled to both.

330
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:58,000
Career and family.
You can do whatever you want.

331
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,080
Whatever you want.

332
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:23,000
Is this where you practice?

333
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:34,120
Sorry.

334
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:37,000
Excuse me.

335
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,160
- Are you not the famous violinist? - No.

336
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,070
North ... something.

337
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:45,230
Nordstrom. Karin Nordstrom!

338
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:49,070
Are you not Karin Nordstrom?

339
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,180
What are you doing?

340
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:01,090
I told you I'll do the dishes.

341
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:05,130
Why can't we keep a simple deal here?

342
00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:09,240
- Why are you always so angry? - I'm not angry!

343
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:14,130
It just hurts to see when you suffer like that.

344
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:18,040
- It is you who suffer. - I don't.

345
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,170
What's wrong with you?

346
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:29,160
I thought you would be
happy that you are alive ...

347
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,120
... that you will be with your family.

348
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,190
I am happy that I'm with you, darling.

349
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:42,050
I told you not to go on tour.

350
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:49,030
Why did you go on with it?
Why did you have to do it?

351
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:52,020
- Was it for Darren? - Forget it!

352
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:54,130
I think about it every day.

353
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:58,050
Do you think he will come here
just to hold a master class?

354
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:00,930
Why would he come to a place like this rat hole?

355
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:03,090
We both know why he's coming!

356
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:08,190
I am a man, and I know it very well.

357
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,100
Is there something going on?

358
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:26,180
-Be honest! No, there is nothing going on.

359
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:31,070
But it was something. More than ten years ago.

360
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:34,060
I can't forget it! Do you still feel something?

361
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:37,040
You have to work with it
and stop thinking about it.

362
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:40,080
I do. Answer me honestly.

363
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,110
-Is there something going
on between you two? -No.

364
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:47,070
Why is he here? -To teach my students.

365
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:50,230
Because you...

366
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:14,530
Listen, everyone! Please welcome Bear Darren.

367
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:22,030
Thank you.

368
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:28,190
It looks like a cocktail party.

369
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:32,200
Stand in a circle around me so I can see you.

370
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:37,470
And please, leave your bags, coats and all that.

371
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:40,160
So you can relax.

372
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,150
I usually do this. Then my hands are relaxed.

373
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:46,010
To feel that your hands relax.

374
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:48,160
It feels good.

375
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:53,220
I go around to get this fine ...

376
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:57,090
... connection between all of us.

377
00:51:57,130 --> 00:51:59,050
Bear.

378
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:00,230
What?

379
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:04,030
My name is Bjorn.

380
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:07,030
- Antti. - Hey, Antti.

381
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:09,040
Nice to meet you.

382
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:12,190
- Jarno? - Yes.

383
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:14,200
And you are ...?

384
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,160
-And you? -Francesco.

385
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,630
You are from Italy? That's nice.

386
00:52:17,654 --> 00:52:19,419
Wonderful.

387
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:23,140
Sofia. Wow!

388
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:30,010
-You have beautiful eyes. 
-Thanks.

389
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:34,090
- You too. 
- Really beautiful. Thanks.

390
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:37,070
This is going to be a fantastic week.

391
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:42,200
I really feel that you are talented musicians.

392
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,220
I've noticed immediately that you are talented.

393
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:50,070
Just as your charming teacher promised me.

394
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:54,000
You look good.

395
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:57,050
Teaching suits you.

396
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,100
- How's your arm? - Good...

397
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:10,190
According to the doctors I can never play again.

398
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:20,090
My arm is completely screwed.

399
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:22,190
Let me see.

400
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,190
Oh God.

401
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:29,110
I didn't know it was that bad.

402
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:35,120
I'm really sorry. You should have told me.

403
00:53:39,070 --> 00:53:42,170
- What? - I thought you could help me.

404
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:46,240
I want to start directing again.

405
00:53:48,010 --> 00:53:52,140
You realize that at your age you 
can not become a top conductor.

406
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:59,060
You weren't exactly young when you started.

407
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:03,010
You've always been stubborn.

408
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:06,060
I mean seriously ... Yeah.

409
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:12,020
You know that I still love you?

410
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:14,180
I know.

411
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:32,080
I'll check my calendar, but I think it's gone be ok.

412
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:35,030
- I'll let you know. - Okay thanks.

413
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:37,050
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

414
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:42,070
Oh my God!

415
00:55:42,110 --> 00:55:44,130
What is it?

416
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:47,030
I have to go to Copenhagen.

417
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:49,150
- Now? - Yes, today.

418
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:52,070
You can not leave in the middle of the lecture.

419
00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:55,130
- Vera Chen has a damn virus. - I need you here!

420
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:56,020
- I need you here. - I'm sorry, but I must.

421
00:55:56,020 --> 00:56:00,090
I'm sorry, but I have to find a new soloist.

422
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:05,130
I need you here. Can't you call someone?

423
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:09,040
Rehearsals start on Monday.

424
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:14,180
- What are you going to play? - Mendelssohn.

425
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:18,130
The violin concerto?

426
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:24,190
- What? - Listen to my students.

427
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:28,020
I have practiced the piece with them.

428
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:34,120
- Did you choose our concert? - Yes I did.

429
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:38,020
- Hello! - Hello.

430
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:43,100
- We'll talk about it later. - I'll call you.

431
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:46,010
- It was a long time ago. - Yes.

432
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:51,150
Hi. Should we go? - Yes.

433
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:17,150
What are you waiting for? Begin, please.

434
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,110
Sofia? You can't be serious.

435
00:58:57,150 --> 00:59:00,100
-Hello to you too. Did you hear what I said?

436
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:02,090
She plays like an angel.

437
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:05,130
She is totally unreliable and lazy.

438
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:08,050
She is always late and missing notes.

439
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:11,240
She is not ready for such a big challenge.

440
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:14,120
It's not your decision.

441
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:18,070
No. But I want you to get a musician -

442
00:59:18,110 --> 00:59:20,190
- that's as good as Vera or me.

443
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:23,340
- And that would be? - Antti.

444
00:59:25,010 --> 00:59:26,220
Thanks, that's enough.

445
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:35,080
You haven't seen what he can do.
He has star potential.

446
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,940
- You may go. - Thanks.

447
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,220
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

448
00:59:42,190 --> 00:59:45,010
I'm going with you.

449
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:48,110
I'll practice with him all week.

450
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:52,100
- Will you come with me to Copenhagen? - Yes.

451
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:59,210
- It's a big risk for me.
- I'll take the responsibility. I promise.

452
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:03,200
- You're not in love with him, right? - No.

453
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:10,150
I know you prefer Jallu,
but this excellent vodka will have to do.

454
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:19,240
Health.

455
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:27,070
I thought you could help me.

456
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:32,050
I want to return to the big world.

457
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:39,210
Why do not you talk to them in Seattle 
and arrange a meeting for me there?

458
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:42,200
I want to be a conductor.

459
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:53,080
-It's very lonely being a god.

460
01:00:55,070 --> 01:00:58,180
I have nothing else in life except the music.

461
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:04,100
I'm not sure if people love me,

462
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:07,050
or just want to take advantage of me.

463
01:01:07,090 --> 01:01:10,130
I don't think you want to be in this position.

464
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:22,070
The conductor stick is much
heavier than you imagine.

465
01:01:23,090 --> 01:01:27,070
Sometimes you have to lift it with both hands

466
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:30,230
and it still feels as if it's falling down.

467
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:34,050
You know nothing about this.

468
01:01:41,150 --> 01:01:45,110
I can not be friends with my musicians.

469
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:51,230
Otherwise, I could not hear my music.

470
01:01:55,230 --> 01:02:00,180
You should continue to teach, Karin. It suits you.

471
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:04,220
I just want to warn you because ...

472
01:02:05,070 --> 01:02:11,240
... if you want to be king,
you're going to lose everything in the end.

473
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:18,020
You have your family. Do you want to lose it?

474
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:23,040
- You do not want to lose it, right? - Of course not.

475
01:02:55,120 --> 01:03:01,150
Can I get a bottle of your
best champagne? Thanks.

476
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:39,180
I love this room!

477
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:44,060
It's just like being inside a violin.

478
01:03:47,070 --> 01:03:53,000
Yesterday you've let me inside your soul.

479
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:55,090
Remember that.

480
01:03:55,170 --> 01:04:01,190
I want you to know that you all did brilliantly.

481
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:07,030
You are all brilliant musicians. Keep that in mind.

482
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:12,170
The charming teacher has
promised to be with us-

483
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:16,060
-and be an instructor for the new soloist.

484
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:25,040
Ultimately, it was an obvious choice.

485
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:39,230
Welcome to the festival, Antti.
The flight is at seven o'clock on Monday.

486
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:35,090
What is it?

487
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:43,050
I just ... I can not concentrate.

488
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:48,090
I have too many thoughts in my head.

489
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:53,170
Then clear you mind.
This is an important performance.

490
01:05:54,130 --> 01:05:56,130
I'm just so ...

491
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:01,010
I'm just so confused about all this.

492
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:06,010
I want you to do well.

493
01:06:06,050 --> 01:06:10,690
- Why is it so important to you?
- Concentrate and play well!

494
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,100
So you want me to play well?

495
01:06:14,110 --> 01:06:18,020
When I graduated Darren
asked me to join the tour.

496
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:22,150
I've left everything.
My family, my boyfriend, my home.

497
01:06:22,190 --> 01:06:25,020
I had nothing but the music.

498
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:30,100
I'm not saying you have to make hasty decisions

499
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:34,050
but if you're so confused,
it's a sign of something.

500
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:38,060
I can not say what's best for your career.

501
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:41,130
I can not teach you anything
you do not want to find yourself.

502
01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:46,190
But this much I can tell you that
you are forced to make choices.

503
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:09,040
I'm very proud of you.

504
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:13,070
I could take some time off
and come and listen to you.

505
01:07:16,190 --> 01:07:19,180
I do not think that's a good idea.

506
01:07:28,030 --> 01:07:30,140
I have to concentrate on playing.

507
01:07:30,190 --> 01:07:34,190
-Of course I'll let you do it.
I have to make choices.

508
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,180
What are you talking about?

509
01:07:39,050 --> 01:07:42,180
- What's wrong with you?
- I have to make choices.

510
01:07:49,180 --> 01:07:51,120
Oh no ...

511
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:55,060
You're breaking up with me.

512
01:07:56,060 --> 01:07:59,000
Is that what you want?

513
01:08:00,050 --> 01:08:02,240
Is that what you're trying to say?

514
01:08:03,130 --> 01:08:06,090
- Can you answer me? 
- I have to focus on the music.

515
01:08:06,130 --> 01:08:09,130
- Focus on the music? 
- Yes, the music!

516
01:08:09,170 --> 01:08:12,090
I have to take a decision. I'm so confused.

517
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:17,170
I'm being pulled in all directions. 
I can not concentrate.

518
01:08:17,210 --> 01:08:21,170
- I have to make choices. 
- So then you must get rid of me?

519
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:22,010
- Is that so? 
- I did not say that. Did I say that?

520
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:28,030
Do you love me?

521
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:35,210
It's not about that. Sofia!

522
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:41,100
You have to understand that
it requires great sacrifice.

523
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:43,460
Go then, damn it!

524
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:49,060
- Success requires sacrifice. 
- Sacrifice? Seriously?

525
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:51,050
Fuck you.

526
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:56,200
It need not be the end.

527
01:08:56,240 --> 01:09:00,000
Good luck with the concert
and the rest of your life.

528
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:03,120
You will probably be damn successful.

529
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:05,180
- Sofia. 
- What?

530
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:09,020
- What is it? 
- One more thing.

531
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:11,020
Say it.

532
01:09:18,230 --> 01:09:22,200
Nothing. I love you.

533
01:09:28,190 --> 01:09:30,220
Fuck off!

534
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:42,100
This is unreal.

535
01:10:50,150 --> 01:10:52,060
Incomprehensible.

536
01:10:54,230 --> 01:10:57,230
"Welcome to Copenhagen."

537
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:09,170
This is amazing.

538
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:16,080
Just remember everything I've taught you.

539
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:22,190
Of course.

540
01:11:30,190 --> 01:11:32,240
After this we are going to Paris.

541
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:36,110
Okay. We can go anywhere in Europe.

542
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:39,160
I'll be your soloist and conductor.

543
01:11:40,150 --> 01:11:44,070
Why stop there?
The world of music is bigger than Europe.

544
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:50,110
- I've always wanted to go to Sydney. 
- I've been there.

545
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:53,510
- New Zealand. 
- Been there.

546
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,050
- Mexico. 

547
01:11:57,050 --> 01:11:59,050
Svalbard.

548
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:03,130
- You need a firearms license there. 
- I'll get one.

549
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:06,150
I'll shoot anyone who comes between us.

550
01:12:06,190 --> 01:12:08,110
Great.

551
01:12:08,150 --> 01:12:11,110
We're going to be a fantastic team.

552
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:15,080
I'll help you shoot.

553
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:45,200
Oh.

554
01:12:49,110 --> 01:12:51,220
Sorry I rode so fast.

555
01:13:11,140 --> 01:13:14,110
What are you working on currently?

556
01:13:14,210 --> 01:13:16,200
A bit of everything.

557
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:21,050
My calendar is almost as fully
booked as in the wild years.

558
01:13:21,090 --> 01:13:23,160
- That sounds good. - Yes.

559
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:27,040
How are you? You look great. - Thanks.

560
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:29,170
Have you met each other? This is Antti.

561
01:13:29,210 --> 01:13:31,240
- This is Saulius. 
- Antti.

562
01:13:32,030 --> 01:13:34,110
- Nice to meet you. 
- Antti!

563
01:13:36,090 --> 01:13:41,100
- Welcome to the world at large. 
- Thanks. It is a great honor.

564
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:43,180
Hey!

565
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:45,080
This way.

566
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:49,010
Hello! Thanks for the great experience.

567
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:51,090
It was great to play Beethoven with you.

568
01:13:51,130 --> 01:13:54,070
- It was wonderful. Come. 
- Thank you.

569
01:13:58,220 --> 01:14:01,000
We are ready.

570
01:14:02,130 --> 01:14:04,060
Well.

571
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:07,100
- Is everything okay? - Yes.

572
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:11,140
We start when you are ready.

573
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,100
So.

574
01:15:01,210 --> 01:15:03,170
We try again.

575
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:05,190
I'm ready.

576
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:23,040
More feeling!

577
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:50,070
More love!

578
01:15:57,020 --> 01:15:58,100
Shit!

579
01:16:09,130 --> 01:16:11,120
Thanks! It's enough!

580
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:24,000
I do not know...

581
01:16:24,210 --> 01:16:28,000
This is going to be a long week.

582
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:37,100
He was just a little nervous today.

583
01:16:37,190 --> 01:16:41,110
No! That was the goal.

584
01:16:41,150 --> 01:16:44,090
The kid is going to be fine. Trust me.

585
01:16:44,210 --> 01:16:50,030
- It will be fine, trust me. - Well. I really hope so.

586
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:56,070
Actually it's a long story.

587
01:16:56,110 --> 01:17:01,000
We played Mendelssohn's violin
concerto here in the concert hall.

588
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:02,230
Really? Wow!

589
01:17:02,230 --> 01:17:07,140
- I should lie down and sleep now. - Let's dance!

590
01:18:30,070 --> 01:18:31,240
What is it?

591
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:34,170
Do you think you're here on vacation?

592
01:18:35,220 --> 01:18:38,200
I'm just taking a little break.

593
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:57,240
I thought we could go over there and practice.

594
01:18:59,010 --> 01:19:01,020
In the bedroom.

595
01:19:05,150 --> 01:19:07,100
What are you saying?

596
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:11,010
It would be nice if we could just fuck all the time.

597
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:18,060
- What is it? - Nothing. I'm just old.

598
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,000
You are not. You look wonderful.

599
01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:26,230
You smell nice.

600
01:19:28,210 --> 01:19:31,050
- Your hair is lovely. - Antti ...

601
01:19:31,090 --> 01:19:33,070
Your cheek is gorgeous.

602
01:19:33,110 --> 01:19:36,050
I really have to work now.

603
01:19:36,220 --> 01:19:41,110
Okay. I apologize.

604
01:20:05,170 --> 01:20:09,060
Stop! It was too fast, Antti.

605
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:14,170
Antti, you must introduce the orchestra.

606
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:19,070
It's your job, not the conductor's.

607
01:20:21,180 --> 01:20:24,130
Let's return to the same part again.

608
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:58,130
No, I'm in the middle of an exercise.

609
01:20:59,190 --> 01:21:03,110
Tomorrow? I'm going to be busy.

610
01:21:08,050 --> 01:21:10,060
Much better!

611
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:13,000
Antti.

612
01:21:14,170 --> 01:21:18,070
Do you know the Italian
name of this movement?

613
01:21:24,020 --> 01:21:29,050
- No. - Never mind. It has three words.

614
01:21:30,010 --> 01:21:33,220
Allegro Molto Appassionato.

615
01:21:35,070 --> 01:21:37,180
Is there a comma between the words?

616
01:21:43,130 --> 01:21:44,230
No.

617
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:49,130
It's not Allegro Molto, Appassionato.

618
01:21:49,230 --> 01:21:53,110
Nor Allegro Molto, Passionato.

619
01:21:54,230 --> 01:21:58,100
It is Allegro Molto Appassionato.

620
01:21:58,140 --> 01:22:00,140
Play it again!

621
01:22:05,150 --> 01:22:07,140
This was a mistake.

622
01:22:07,180 --> 01:22:11,210
- You should have chosen Sofia.
- Darren is always like that.

623
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,240
It's going to be alright.

624
01:22:20,230 --> 01:22:24,050
You have to move your things back to your room.

625
01:22:24,090 --> 01:22:27,010
Jaakko and Eemeli will be here tomorrow.

626
01:22:27,050 --> 01:22:30,060
- At the concert? - Yes, and Tivoli Gardens.

627
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:34,030
I can not see them for a while.
I got an invitation to Seattle.

628
01:22:34,070 --> 01:22:36,160
I'll go there. - What?

629
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:39,110
I'm going to meet some people there.

630
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:44,080
- What about us? - What do you mean by "us"?

631
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:46,140
The two of us.

632
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:52,160
I never said that I would leave my family.

633
01:23:36,170 --> 01:23:38,110
Come here.

634
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:41,200
Come here.

635
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:47,200
Out with you.

636
01:23:48,070 --> 01:23:50,090
It's the wrong way.

637
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:03,060
Off you go.

638
01:24:20,130 --> 01:24:23,130
- What's this? - This is my student's room.

639
01:24:24,010 --> 01:24:26,170
Do you live both in the same apartment?

640
01:24:26,220 --> 01:24:29,110
Yes, this is a guest apartment.

641
01:24:31,220 --> 01:24:35,230
Where is he now?
- I do not know. We have different rhythms.

642
01:24:36,170 --> 01:24:38,200
Where would you like to eat?

643
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:42,000
I do not care. Where do the two of you eat?

644
01:24:43,010 --> 01:24:46,150
- Maybe an Italian restaurant? - I want pizza.

645
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:55,240
Hi there.

646
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:58,000
Hello...

647
01:24:58,230 --> 01:25:02,190
-You came. Yeah, just for a few days.

648
01:25:02,230 --> 01:25:06,200
We thought about going to Tivoli
and come and listen to your concert.

649
01:25:07,110 --> 01:25:11,060
Oh, it was ... the nice.

650
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:16,090
We are going out to eat.
Can you recommend something?

651
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:21,040
I am not aware of any. - Suggest something now.

652
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:28,130
There are many good places.

653
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:33,190
You have to stay strong.
You have to eat something.

654
01:25:34,190 --> 01:25:37,080
- I've just eaten, thank you. - He has eaten.

655
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:37,140
Hi.

656
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:42,020
-Hello. He may well follow anyway.

657
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:46,100
Let's go.

658
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:51,090
Cheers for this amazing opportunity, Antti.

659
01:25:51,140 --> 01:25:53,090
Cheers.

660
01:25:53,130 --> 01:25:55,080
Cheers there too.

661
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:09,200
This was a dream come true for you?

662
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:18,210
Yes, I've been feeling really well.
Thanks for your interest.

663
01:26:19,110 --> 01:26:23,210
When I grow up I want to be
as good a violinist as a mother.

664
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:35,980
Is not a little warm in here?

665
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:40,190
I don't believe so.

666
01:26:47,140 --> 01:26:51,070
You and dad have identical shirts.

667
01:26:54,050 --> 01:26:56,020
It seems so.

668
01:26:56,060 --> 01:27:01,240
- Did you buy those from the same place?
- Mom bought it for me.

669
01:27:03,190 --> 01:27:06,040
Where did you buy yours?

670
01:27:07,110 --> 01:27:10,130
I can not remember.

671
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:44,070
This seems to be a best-selling men's shirt.

672
01:28:06,070 --> 01:28:08,140
More love!

673
01:28:46,060 --> 01:28:48,140
... Lake Garda, for example.

674
01:28:48,180 --> 01:28:52,000
- Where is it? - In Italy.

675
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:56,030
- They have good ice cream there.
- Wasn't Veracini Italian?

676
01:28:56,070 --> 01:29:00,220
One should eat pizza at the smaller places.

677
01:29:01,070 --> 01:29:03,120
They have the best pizza.

678
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:15,390
I have a relationship with Karin.

679
01:29:17,180 --> 01:29:19,120
What?

680
01:29:19,170 --> 01:29:23,740
Karin and I have a relationship.

681
01:29:24,030 --> 01:29:26,100
I understand English.

682
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,210
It has been going on for over two months.

683
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,090
I just thought you should know.

684
01:29:33,150 --> 01:29:35,150
Is the ice cream was for you, sir?

685
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,230
Here you go.

686
01:29:39,180 --> 01:29:42,020
A double espresso for her.

687
01:29:44,020 --> 01:29:46,100
And we'll have two regular.

688
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:55,090
- Thanks. - You're welcome.

689
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:11,040
It's not what you think.

690
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:13,100
- Is not that? - Shut up!

691
01:30:14,070 --> 01:30:16,170
- Eemeli, we go now. - Jaakko.

692
01:30:17,020 --> 01:30:19,220
I want to stay here with Mom. She lied to me.

693
01:30:20,010 --> 01:30:22,040
I want to eat my ice cream! - Leave it.

694
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:25,070
Let me explain. - It's not necessary.

695
01:30:26,010 --> 01:30:28,120
I hope you understand what is at stake here.

696
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:31,190
Eemeli, let's go. Forget the ice cream!

697
01:30:34,050 --> 01:30:38,070
Did you think you could achieve 
success by fucking your teacher?

698
01:30:39,130 --> 01:30:41,040
James!

699
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:44,010
James...

700
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:56,030
- Let me explain. - What's to explain?

701
01:30:57,010 --> 01:30:59,220
You have a relationship. Fine. Congratulations.

702
01:31:00,010 --> 01:31:02,070
That's not true. He's just my student.

703
01:31:02,140 --> 01:31:04,200
This is completely unnecessary.

704
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:08,140
- Is he good in bed? - It doesn't matter.

705
01:31:08,180 --> 01:31:12,030
- It's not about that. - What is it about then?

706
01:31:12,140 --> 01:31:16,010
He is a gifted violinist. I wanted to help him.

707
01:31:16,050 --> 01:31:19,110
- Help him ?! - This is about me.

708
01:31:19,150 --> 01:31:21,140
- About you? - About all this.

709
01:31:21,180 --> 01:31:23,210
- What? - The music!

710
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:33,010
Why are you lying to me? What do you want?

711
01:31:35,070 --> 01:31:38,080
I want you. I want you.

712
01:31:38,130 --> 01:31:43,140
You've had us. We've been here all the time.

713
01:31:43,180 --> 01:31:46,090
But there is no place for others in your life.

714
01:31:46,130 --> 01:31:49,230
There is only room for
your grief and your feelings.

715
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:53,010
I've wasted my best years for you.

716
01:31:53,050 --> 01:31:57,050
So you would have a good time
and would be able to do your music.

717
01:31:57,190 --> 01:32:01,070
I may not understand art,
but I understand people.

718
01:32:01,110 --> 01:32:04,190
I took care of our family,
worked and paid the bills.

719
01:32:04,230 --> 01:32:07,210
- Everything, dammit! - I also did my part.

720
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,180
Well, then fine.

721
01:32:17,070 --> 01:32:22,210
Over the past year I have
tried to make you feel good.

722
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,130
So you could make music.

723
01:32:28,090 --> 01:32:32,110
And when you had the
accident and lost your hand ...

724
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:37,010
It is not only you who have lost your hand.

725
01:32:37,150 --> 01:32:41,060
It was also a loss for me. I lost my wife.

726
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:43,160
You have not lost me.

727
01:32:44,220 --> 01:32:46,240
Let's go, Eemeli.

728
01:32:49,030 --> 01:32:50,200
I'll go with you.

729
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:56,040
No, our marriage is over, Karin.

730
01:32:57,020 --> 01:32:59,100
- Jaakko. - Let him go.

731
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:01,200
James!

732
01:33:09,130 --> 01:33:11,040
Karin!

733
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:13,190
Karin, listen to me.

734
01:33:13,190 --> 01:33:15,140
Wait.

735
01:33:16,150 --> 01:33:19,010
I just wanted to be honest.

736
01:33:20,150 --> 01:33:22,120
I apologize.

737
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:27,210
It was not the best way,
but now we do not pretend anymore.

738
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,020
Can you put your phone away?

739
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:32,080
Listen to me!

740
01:33:32,180 --> 01:33:35,110
I just wanted to be honest.

741
01:33:38,020 --> 01:33:41,190
Are you listening? Forgive me.

742
01:33:43,030 --> 01:33:45,140
Okay. Let's be honest.

743
01:33:46,110 --> 01:33:49,190
You would not have been selected without me.

744
01:33:51,030 --> 01:33:53,170
Darren preferred Sofia.

745
01:33:56,180 --> 01:34:00,170
He thinks Sofia is more talented than you.

746
01:34:01,050 --> 01:34:05,130
And if I'm completely honest, I agree with him.

747
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:09,190
Why are you doing this?

748
01:34:11,050 --> 01:34:13,190
Why do you play these games?

749
01:34:14,140 --> 01:34:16,240
You're fucking crazy.

750
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:21,100
-You are all crazy.
I do not care what you think about us.

751
01:34:22,140 --> 01:34:25,070
You just ruined my marriage.

752
01:34:25,150 --> 01:34:28,040
What kind of marriage is that?

753
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:33,030
Did you hear? What kind of marriage is that?

754
01:34:34,010 --> 01:34:36,060
Fucking idiot!

755
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:00,080
Where is he?

756
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:03,170
I do not know.

757
01:35:10,050 --> 01:35:14,110
Excuse me. It was my mistake.

758
01:35:18,010 --> 01:35:20,100
We will begin shortly.

759
01:35:31,070 --> 01:35:33,220
I'm ready. We can begin.

760
01:35:36,150 --> 01:35:39,080
Are you going to play with your jacket on?

761
01:35:42,040 --> 01:35:44,060
Yes I am.

762
01:35:55,230 --> 01:35:58,090
Listening to the orchestra, Antti.

763
01:35:58,140 --> 01:36:00,010
From the beginning.

764
01:36:13,090 --> 01:36:15,120
Too low.

765
01:36:17,010 --> 01:36:19,050
Again.

766
01:36:36,060 --> 01:36:38,210
Now it was too high.

767
01:36:42,010 --> 01:36:44,800
Lets start from the beginning.

768
01:36:51,060 --> 01:36:56,030
We'll try with just the solo violin.

769
01:37:34,020 --> 01:37:35,240
Too low.

770
01:37:41,170 --> 01:37:43,150
Too low.

771
01:37:45,070 --> 01:37:47,040
Still too low.

772
01:37:48,130 --> 01:37:50,140
Too low.

773
01:37:52,110 --> 01:37:54,190
Still too low!

774
01:37:56,210 --> 01:37:58,150
Too low.

775
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:02,090
Again too low.

776
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:06,020
Too high.

777
01:38:07,120 --> 01:38:09,140
Still too high.

778
01:38:10,060 --> 01:38:11,440
Again.

779
01:38:12,180 --> 01:38:14,040
And again.

780
01:38:15,110 --> 01:38:19,130
And again.

781
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:22,540
Again. Again.

782
01:38:23,220 --> 01:38:26,640
Again. Again.

783
01:38:28,020 --> 01:38:29,190
Again.

784
01:38:29,190 --> 01:38:31,130
Again!

785
01:38:31,764 --> 01:38:32,010
Again!

786
01:38:32,010 --> 01:38:33,220
And again!

787
01:38:38,210 --> 01:38:41,110
Now let's try with the whole orchestra.

788
01:38:42,060 --> 01:38:43,390
From the beginning.

789
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:11,190
Now Antti played well.

790
01:39:12,090 --> 01:39:15,020
But the orchestra lagged.

791
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:17,240
You must listen to him too.

792
01:39:18,060 --> 01:39:24,030
Imagine me as a great bird with big wings.

793
01:39:24,070 --> 01:39:26,080
And when I do this ...

794
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:31,120
... imagine that you are under
my large wings protection.

795
01:39:35,120 --> 01:39:39,010
And from now on play in sync -

796
01:39:39,050 --> 01:39:43,090
- in my magic wings universe.

797
01:39:45,060 --> 01:39:47,150
Let's start from the beginning.

798
01:40:44,010 --> 01:40:48,040
You must not get out in the
middle of a trial, no matter what!

799
01:40:50,070 --> 01:40:53,050
You look miserable.
Where have you been all night?

800
01:40:53,090 --> 01:40:55,230
- Answer me. - Do not touch me!

801
01:40:56,130 --> 01:40:59,070
I think I will do fine without you.

802
01:40:59,110 --> 01:41:01,220
Calm down. Did you hear what I said?

803
01:41:03,020 --> 01:41:08,020
I want to be at peace now. I have to concentrate.

804
01:41:55,160 --> 01:41:58,150
You've reached Jaakko Helenius.

805
01:41:58,200 --> 01:42:01,110
Leave a message after the beep.

806
01:42:01,190 --> 01:42:06,490
Hi, it's me. You're probably at work now.

807
01:42:16,170 --> 01:42:21,170
Jaakko, I think we should talk.

808
01:42:22,130 --> 01:42:24,190
Call me please.

809
01:42:39,140 --> 01:42:45,090
Tell me ... How long did you keep it hidden?

810
01:42:46,010 --> 01:42:52,100
It's like an underground river.
It has always been there waiting.

811
01:42:54,010 --> 01:43:00,000
There's something you should know.

812
01:43:01,060 --> 01:43:03,240
This here ...

813
01:43:04,030 --> 01:43:06,530
Do not say anything. I do not want to know!

814
01:43:07,020 --> 01:43:11,130
What's between you and the
woman is none of my business!

815
01:43:11,170 --> 01:43:14,210
But I can see that it gives you a lot of pain.

816
01:43:16,060 --> 01:43:18,040
I just want to ...

817
01:43:18,080 --> 01:43:22,000
When I was your age, I admired
one of my teachers tremendously.

818
01:43:22,040 --> 01:43:25,060
An old Russian man. Strict as hell.

819
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,060
I was always trying to please him.

820
01:43:28,100 --> 01:43:30,200
One day he taught me a beautiful lesson.

821
01:43:30,240 --> 01:43:33,160
I was sitting in class and looked up at him.

822
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:37,210
He was a tall man.
He asked what I was watching.

823
01:43:38,070 --> 01:43:40,060
I replied: "You, maestro."

824
01:43:40,150 --> 01:43:43,030
He asked why.

825
01:43:43,070 --> 01:43:45,220
I said that because I wanted to learn something.

826
01:43:46,010 --> 01:43:49,030
He replied: "Do not look at me."

827
01:43:49,240 --> 01:43:53,730
If you want to learn something, look at yourself!

828
01:43:54,200 --> 01:44:00,220
You are nobody else's creation.
You are your own creation.

829
01:44:03,100 --> 01:44:08,070
I really appreciate that you tell me this.

830
01:44:09,170 --> 01:44:12,040
Forget what I said!

831
01:44:13,240 --> 01:44:16,130
Fuck this and your appreciation!

832
01:44:16,220 --> 01:44:22,060
Put everything in your music
so it can be heard tomorrow.

833
01:44:22,100 --> 01:44:24,170
Fuck everything else!

834
01:44:25,070 --> 01:44:27,140
I need that pain!

835
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:31,050
So give it all to me tomorrow!

836
01:44:38,150 --> 01:44:41,200
It just think that all of this ...

837
01:44:42,100 --> 01:44:46,020
... is going too fast and I can not ...

838
01:44:47,180 --> 01:44:50,110
I do not know. It feels ...

839
01:44:51,140 --> 01:44:57,110
However it feels ... it's good.

840
01:45:01,090 --> 01:45:03,130
Give me everything you have.

841
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,010
Tomorrow you play it all for me.

842
01:45:07,050 --> 01:45:10,110
Put it all in your music.

843
01:45:18,040 --> 01:45:20,020
Yes.

844
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:23,070
- Health, as you say in Denmark. - Health.

845
01:46:58,040 --> 01:47:00,120
I came to pick up my stuff.

846
01:47:00,160 --> 01:47:03,210
I'll stay at the hotel the rest of the time.

847
01:47:15,090 --> 01:47:17,220
You know what's strange?

848
01:47:19,130 --> 01:47:23,110
When I came here it occurred to me ...

849
01:47:25,110 --> 01:47:28,030
Once I've sent you a letter.

850
01:47:29,150 --> 01:47:31,210
I was 12 years old.

851
01:47:33,060 --> 01:47:35,110
It was a letter of admiration.

852
01:47:37,120 --> 01:47:40,080
I do not know if you remember it.

853
01:47:43,070 --> 01:47:46,180
I had read an interview where they asked you ...

854
01:47:49,060 --> 01:47:53,100
... what you would do if you 
could not play the violin.

855
01:47:54,150 --> 01:47:56,140
Do you remember?

856
01:47:58,220 --> 01:48:00,150
No.

857
01:48:08,070 --> 01:48:12,030
You said you would play anyway.

858
01:48:14,010 --> 01:48:18,060
In my letter I've asked

859
01:48:18,100 --> 01:48:22,140
What kind of violin can only 
play inside one's head.

860
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:29,180
You've never answered.

861
01:48:37,220 --> 01:48:39,120
I can help you.

862
01:48:39,160 --> 01:48:43,120
I can try to get you an audition in Seattle.

863
01:48:50,030 --> 01:48:52,150
I'll go there tomorrow.

864
01:48:53,110 --> 01:48:55,190
After your rehearsal.

865
01:49:05,020 --> 01:49:08,090
All my life I have been afraid to be bad.

866
01:49:10,070 --> 01:49:12,180
To be mediocre.

867
01:49:14,160 --> 01:49:21,020
I've done everything I could to 
be better than everyone else.

868
01:49:22,170 --> 01:49:24,200
To be the best.

869
01:49:29,120 --> 01:49:31,190
But what does that mean?

870
01:49:37,240 --> 01:49:41,060
I do not care how I play tomorrow.

871
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:46,190
I no longer want to be the best.
