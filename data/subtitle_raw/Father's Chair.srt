1
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,041
Pedro?

2
00:04:23,292 --> 00:04:24,334
Theo?

3
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,667
Theo, how did you get in?

4
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:30,459
Can you believe that Pedro
left me waiting...

5
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:31,876
at the exchange student meeting?

6
00:04:33,292 --> 00:04:35,000
- What do you mean?
- He didn't show up.

7
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:37,250
I called him up,
he didn't answer the phone.

8
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,876
- He didn't show up.
- So?

9
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:44,292
Branca, I called you up
and you didn't answer the phone.

10
00:04:44,334 --> 00:04:47,000
I've been ringing the bell for half an
hour, you didn't answer the door.

11
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:49,417
And you left this door here open.

12
00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:53,542
Theo, there's no way.

13
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,959
You can't just keep coming in
like this, without calling first.

14
00:04:56,542 --> 00:04:58,209
Branca, I'm sorry.
Is Pedro here?

15
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,667
- And you can't have a key anymore.
- Branca, if our only problem...

16
00:05:02,709 --> 00:05:04,501
is me having or not having
the key to this place...

17
00:05:04,501 --> 00:05:07,918
- we were doing alright, huh?
- Yeah, that's not the problem.

18
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,292
I'm the problem.

19
00:05:09,334 --> 00:05:13,250
For me to continue living here, huh?
That's the problem, right?

20
00:05:23,209 --> 00:05:25,959
I brought ZezÃ©'s money.
I want you to pay him...

21
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,209
only after he finishes
waterproofing the pool.

22
00:05:28,209 --> 00:05:30,667
- Can you do that?
- Why waterproof it?

23
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,209
The tiles, they'll be delivered
next week, they're already paid for.

24
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:39,292
- Why tiles?
- Why? I don't know, Branca.

25
00:05:39,334 --> 00:05:41,375
Maybe to cover the hole
out there on the verandah.

26
00:05:41,417 --> 00:05:42,834
I don't know
why you're making a pool...

27
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:44,375
if we're going to sell the house, Theo.

28
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:46,834
Because it'll bring the price up,
right? Because we'll make money.

29
00:05:46,876 --> 00:05:48,876
But, maybe the guy who buys it
doesn't want a pool...

30
00:05:48,876 --> 00:05:51,083
- Yeah, he might not like the house.
- Might not know how to swim.

31
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,209
Let's stop around here, please.

32
00:05:57,209 --> 00:05:59,751
I'm tired as hell. We don't even know
if we're going to sell the house.

33
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:04,959
What do you mean?
You don't seem to understand.

34
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,667
As soon as I find my own place,
I'm leaving.

35
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:11,876
Do you understand?

36
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,501
- Where were you, son?
- My computer broke.

37
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:35,501
I took it to get fixed.

38
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:38,083
We had an appointment today,
did you forget?

39
00:06:38,626 --> 00:06:41,626
You had. Alone.

40
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,250
I had an appointment.

41
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:48,584
Alone.

42
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,250
It was important for him to go today.
Today was the day...

43
00:06:59,334 --> 00:07:01,209
They have this rule there,
that says the kids...

44
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:03,417
have to go at least one day.
If they don't go one day...

45
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:06,083
To be able to pick your city.

46
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,000
You have to go just once.
Just one time.

47
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,751
To guarantee you get Christchurch,
I had to pay.

48
00:07:12,751 --> 00:07:14,209
- Now, he'll have to go next time.
- You paid?

49
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,334
You'll have to go
to the next meeting...

50
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,250
Otherwise, there's no way we
can guarantee you can pick your city.

51
00:07:17,501 --> 00:07:19,751
Dad, I'm not going!
I don't want to!

52
00:07:19,792 --> 00:07:20,959
You don't...

53
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,501
Why aren't you going, Pedro?
Just for me...

54
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:28,667
The way I see it, I'm
giving him a good opportunity, right?

55
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:30,417
Am I wrong?
Isn't it something good?

56
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:32,250
A trip? For you to speak English,

57
00:07:32,292 --> 00:07:34,417
go to the best country
in the world.

58
00:07:34,417 --> 00:07:35,417
If I were a sheep.

59
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:36,709
Theo, you can't force
something like this...

60
00:07:36,751 --> 00:07:39,083
But, I gave him two options.
On two different continents.

61
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,626
I wish my father had
given me something like this.

62
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:42,083
It can't always be the
way you want it.

63
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,501
You thought it was
a good idea.

64
00:07:43,501 --> 00:07:44,667
And you're going to decide for him?

65
00:07:44,667 --> 00:07:47,834
- And when is he going to decide?
- When he decides, Theo. If he decides.

66
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:50,209
You can't just send the
boy off to Australia.

67
00:08:04,334 --> 00:08:05,542
New Zealand.

68
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,584
That's not the issue.

69
00:08:16,334 --> 00:08:18,167
The issue is always
something else, huh?

70
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,584
Yes.

71
00:08:31,334 --> 00:08:32,876
It's always something else.

72
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:00,751
What's that, Branca?

73
00:09:04,292 --> 00:09:05,501
What's what?

74
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:11,834
- Theo...
- What is this chair doing here?

75
00:09:11,834 --> 00:09:14,042
It's for his birthday, Theo.

76
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,959
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Nobody is doing anything.

77
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,834
Why are you doing
this, man?

78
00:09:20,834 --> 00:09:23,792
Why this?
What is this, Branca?

79
00:09:23,834 --> 00:09:25,667
- Calm down, Theo.
- What is it?

80
00:09:26,792 --> 00:09:28,250
What is this chair
doing here?

81
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,792
Why are you
doing this, Branca?

82
00:09:29,834 --> 00:09:32,042
- Wait, Theo, take it easy.
- Why are you doing this to me?

83
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,626
- What is this chair doing here, Pedro?
- My grandfather sent it.

84
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:36,334
Your grandfather?
But, what grandfather, Pedro?

85
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,000
- Listen, Theo...
- Who is your grandfather?

86
00:09:38,042 --> 00:09:39,501
- I'm going to put it in my room.
- Wait, hold it.

87
00:09:39,501 --> 00:09:40,709
Who is your grandfather?

88
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:41,876
- Dad...
- What grandfather?

89
00:09:41,918 --> 00:09:43,417
- I'm going to put it in my room.
- Hold it, Theo.

90
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:44,792
Just a second, Branca.
Let me ask him.

91
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,250
- Right, but don't be like this.
- Does he know his grandfather?

92
00:09:46,292 --> 00:09:47,292
Who is your grandfather?
Do you know him?

93
00:09:47,292 --> 00:09:48,918
- Give me my chair.
- Has your grandfather ever seen you?

94
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:49,959
- Dad.
- Does he know you?

95
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,292
- Let go.
- Hold it. Let me talk to you.

96
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:52,375
- Let go of my chair.
- Does your grandfather know you?

97
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:54,292
Hold it! Does your
grandfather know you?

98
00:09:54,334 --> 00:09:56,375
He doesn't know me!
He doesn't know you!

99
00:09:56,501 --> 00:09:58,292
- He doesn't know you!
- You don't even live here anymore!

100
00:09:58,334 --> 00:10:00,542
- Give me my chair!
- He doesn't know me!

101
00:10:00,584 --> 00:10:02,792
- He doesn't know you!
- Give me my chair!

102
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:04,751
- Stop it, Theo!
- I'll show you all!

103
00:10:04,792 --> 00:10:06,834
- Don't do that, Theo!
- Dad!

104
00:10:08,501 --> 00:10:10,334
Do you want your key?
Do you want your key?

105
00:10:33,876 --> 00:10:39,000
FATHER'S CHAIR

106
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:51,459
DOCTOR BRANCA GADELHA

107
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:45,042
Pedro?

108
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:46,959
Are you going?

109
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:50,209
Have they come to
pick you up already?

110
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,959
I'll be back on Sunday, mom.

111
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:55,125
- Have dinner with me?
- Yes.

112
00:12:58,417 --> 00:12:59,542
Kisses.

113
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:02,417
Happy birthday!

114
00:13:42,209 --> 00:13:44,000
I got my things.
I'm going.

115
00:13:44,042 --> 00:13:45,876
- I'll help you.
- No problem.

116
00:13:52,751 --> 00:13:53,918
I'm sorry.

117
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:58,459
- You didn't have to do that, Theo.
- I know, I'm sorry.

118
00:13:58,918 --> 00:14:00,501
Really, you shouldn't
have done it.

119
00:14:01,584 --> 00:14:02,959
Can you forgive me?

120
00:14:05,501 --> 00:14:07,417
Did you know
about this chair?

121
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:10,667
- Theo...
- It isn't easy for me, Branca.

122
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:11,834
I know.

123
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,542
Go back home and
I'm not living there anymore...

124
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:19,876
it isn't easy.

125
00:14:25,834 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm sorry.

126
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:30,125
Is Pedro up?

127
00:14:30,918 --> 00:14:32,209
Pedro went on a trip.

128
00:14:33,834 --> 00:14:36,834
- It's his birthday on Sunday.
- He went someplace with Levy.

129
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:38,667
Did you let him go?

130
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:41,083
He didn't ask, Theo.

131
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,709
But, the exchange program,
I don't know...

132
00:14:50,751 --> 00:14:52,167
I thought it was something good.

133
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:53,667
I thought that it was
something he'd like,

134
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:55,501
that was good for him...

135
00:14:56,417 --> 00:14:58,834
good for him to stay
away a bit, on his own...

136
00:14:58,876 --> 00:15:00,584
while we worked things out.

137
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:04,125
Things aren't going to
work out, Theo.

138
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:10,209
But, he doesn't have
to stick around and watch.

139
00:15:11,751 --> 00:15:14,542
- I'm leaving that house.
- I'm not talking about that anymore.

140
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:16,375
- I don't...
- I've already given your key back.

141
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:17,792
- I never wanted to live in that house.
- I won't go there anymore.

142
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,375
You don't want me to go?
I won't go.

143
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,292
Branca, I made
that house for you.

144
00:15:21,292 --> 00:15:22,667
It was always something
you wanted, Theo.

145
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:24,584
Let me talk.
I made that house for you.

146
00:15:24,626 --> 00:15:25,918
- Right.
- Branca.

147
00:15:26,501 --> 00:15:28,918
- Theo...
- I made the house for you, for Pedro...

148
00:15:28,918 --> 00:15:30,209
I made the house for us.

149
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,042
- Stop it.
- What's happened to us? Tell me.

150
00:15:34,584 --> 00:15:37,250
- Theo, we've already talked about this.
- What's happening, Branca?

151
00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:39,417
What do you want me to do?
Tell me.

152
00:15:39,584 --> 00:15:42,250
- Theo...
- What do you want me to do?

153
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,667
What do you want me to do?
Tell me?

154
00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:50,000
Tell me.

155
00:16:17,751 --> 00:16:19,751
Theo, let me go.
Theo, please.

156
00:16:19,792 --> 00:16:20,834
Theo...

157
00:16:26,751 --> 00:16:27,959
Hold it, Theo.

158
00:17:36,209 --> 00:17:38,083
- Hi.
- Hi, Theo.

159
00:17:38,834 --> 00:17:41,792
So, I'm going to have dinner
with Pedro on Sunday, at home.

160
00:17:41,834 --> 00:17:43,959
- If you want to show up.
- OK.

161
00:17:45,167 --> 00:17:46,375
I'll go.

162
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:03,751
How's it going?

163
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:04,834
Hi, Theo.

164
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,083
Come in.

165
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,501
You've already made dinner.

166
00:18:12,501 --> 00:18:14,083
No problem.

167
00:18:14,792 --> 00:18:15,959
Put it here.

168
00:18:18,918 --> 00:18:22,667
- It's just that Pedro likes...
- Yeah, he loves it.

169
00:18:22,709 --> 00:18:24,167
Do you want to
drink something?

170
00:18:25,417 --> 00:18:26,501
Water.

171
00:18:32,709 --> 00:18:33,792
Thanks.

172
00:18:34,042 --> 00:18:35,167
Sit down, Theo.

173
00:18:39,584 --> 00:18:43,167
I can't figure...

174
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:45,083
this out...
I don't now...

175
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,292
- It's here.
- No.

176
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,584
There's just one cable.

177
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,417
Looks good.

178
00:19:08,042 --> 00:19:10,042
Yeah, he likes these here...

179
00:19:22,334 --> 00:19:23,792
And the grant?

180
00:19:25,417 --> 00:19:27,584
- Only in September.
- Yeah right, you said before.

181
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,709
Have you decided
where you're going?

182
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:31,876
I think I prefer Spain.

183
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,918
For your specialty, the
United States would be better, huh?

184
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:40,751
It's just that in Spain, besides
medical school, there's Spain.

185
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,292
Yeah.

186
00:19:50,918 --> 00:19:53,626
- Pedro's taking too long.
- Did he say what time he'd be here?

187
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:55,876
- He didn't say.
- Didn't you tell him?

188
00:19:57,334 --> 00:19:59,709
- I just said dinner.
- Let's call?

189
00:20:00,209 --> 00:20:01,792
I've already called twice.

190
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,250
I'm going to call Levy.

191
00:20:24,709 --> 00:20:26,751
Hello, Levy?

192
00:20:27,042 --> 00:20:29,918
Hi, it's Branca.
So, are you guys back already?

193
00:20:31,918 --> 00:20:33,375
What do you mean, "from where"?

194
00:20:34,792 --> 00:20:36,459
Didn't you guys travel, Levy?

195
00:20:36,751 --> 00:20:38,000
What do you mean?

196
00:20:38,501 --> 00:20:40,083
Isn't Pedro there
with you?

197
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,250
Hold it, Levy.

198
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,792
You don't know?
Where's Pedro?

199
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,292
- Renata.
- Hi, Theo.

200
00:20:46,334 --> 00:20:48,209
- How's everything?
- Hi, Renata.

201
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,042
So, Levy?
What's going on?

202
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,083
Pedro told Branca that he was going
to spend the weekend with you.

203
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,709
He didn't say anything to me.

204
00:20:54,751 --> 00:20:56,250
You haven't spoken to him?
He didn't call? Nothing?

205
00:20:56,292 --> 00:20:58,751
- Since Saturday.
- Didn't Pedro tell you, Levy...

206
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,250
where he was going to
spend the weekend?

207
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,083
- No, he didn't tell me anything.
- Tell the truth, son.

208
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:03,167
- Levy, he said...
- I am.

209
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:04,876
He told me he was going
to travel with you, Levy.

210
00:21:04,876 --> 00:21:06,876
No, he didn't come here.
He didn't tell me anything.

211
00:21:06,876 --> 00:21:08,292
- No way, Levy.
- Levy...

212
00:21:08,292 --> 00:21:09,584
We hardly talked this week.

213
00:21:09,584 --> 00:21:11,667
OK, no problem.
Listen...

214
00:21:12,209 --> 00:21:14,292
Do you know if he's been
hanging out with someone else?

215
00:21:14,292 --> 00:21:15,417
If he's got other friends?

216
00:21:15,417 --> 00:21:17,292
If he might be spending the night at
somebody's house that we don't know?

217
00:21:17,334 --> 00:21:20,792
- No, Theo. Nothing's changed.
- Listen, Levy, think.

218
00:21:20,834 --> 00:21:23,083
Think a bit if you remember
anything... something...

219
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,751
he might have done
different, during the week.

220
00:21:25,792 --> 00:21:28,042
At school. Nothing?
You don't remember?

221
00:21:28,042 --> 00:21:31,792
- Think, son.
- I don't know, Levy, if you realize...

222
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:35,709
just how serious this is.
Pedro disappeared.

223
00:21:35,709 --> 00:21:37,167
Do you understand?
He disappeared!

224
00:21:37,167 --> 00:21:39,334
- Branca, Branca. Levy.
- Think back, son.

225
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,959
Anything you remember
might be important now.

226
00:21:42,626 --> 00:21:45,000
There is something,
he asked me for...

227
00:21:45,042 --> 00:21:47,459
he wanted the address to
my Uncle AbrÃ£o's store.

228
00:21:47,542 --> 00:21:49,334
- Who is your Uncle AbrÃ£o?
- He has a computer store.

229
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,751
He wanted to sell
his computer.

230
00:21:52,542 --> 00:21:55,000
Didn't you say that he wanted
to fix his computer?

231
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,417
Yeah, he wanted to get it fixed.

232
00:21:56,459 --> 00:21:57,792
No, he said he wanted to sell it.

233
00:21:57,792 --> 00:22:00,334
- What are you talking about, Levy?
- No, he wanted to fix his computer.

234
00:22:00,334 --> 00:22:03,542
- He told us that...
- He told me he wanted to sell it, Theo.

235
00:22:05,292 --> 00:22:07,042
He tried to sell
his computer to my uncle...

236
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:08,584
but he didn't want to buy it.

237
00:22:09,042 --> 00:22:11,000
What did he want to
sell his computer for?

238
00:22:12,417 --> 00:22:14,584
He said he needed money.

239
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:19,542
Are you sure you got
the right number?

240
00:22:19,542 --> 00:22:21,792
No, Theo. I don't know my own
son's telephone number.

241
00:22:25,209 --> 00:22:27,751
- Call home, see if he's arrived.
- I just called, Theo.

242
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:31,918
We've got to go to
the hospitals, police stations.

243
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:34,000
- Make a list.
- He told me he'd be back Sunday.

244
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
- So he thought he'd be back on Sunday.
- You're trying to find coherence...

245
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,584
- in a lunatic's attitudes.
- He's just a boy.

246
00:22:37,626 --> 00:22:39,918
- A lunatic, a lunatic. A lunatic.
- He's fourteen. He's a boy, Theo.

247
00:22:39,918 --> 00:22:41,250
When I was his age,
I was at home...

248
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,417
taking care of
my mother, alone.

249
00:22:42,417 --> 00:22:46,042
I was on the beach.
Thank God.

250
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:56,959
I'm going to call Cynthia.

251
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,751
What Cynthia?

252
00:22:59,542 --> 00:23:00,876
The Secretary of Health.

253
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:02,292
She can check out
the public hospitals...

254
00:23:02,334 --> 00:23:03,667
we'll check out the private ones.

255
00:23:08,209 --> 00:23:09,501
Cynthia, it's Theo.

256
00:23:10,292 --> 00:23:12,834
I wouldn't be calling
you at home, Cynthia, but it's...

257
00:23:13,167 --> 00:23:14,834
an emergency.

258
00:23:15,209 --> 00:23:18,751
It's Pedro, my boy.
He's disappeared, Cynthia.

259
00:23:28,667 --> 00:23:29,792
Are you OK?

260
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,292
I'm OK.

261
00:23:43,501 --> 00:23:44,751
Pedro?

262
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,584
Pedro? Honey?

263
00:23:48,167 --> 00:23:49,459
Pedro?

264
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:52,792
Son?

265
00:23:52,834 --> 00:23:54,125
Pedro are you home?

266
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:56,125
Pedro, call me as soon
as you get in.

267
00:23:56,209 --> 00:23:57,250
Theo...

268
00:24:13,209 --> 00:24:17,626
Hello. Please,
is this Pedro Gadelha's house?

269
00:24:18,876 --> 00:24:21,417
On Catumbi... Street.

270
00:24:22,334 --> 00:24:24,083
What's this one called?
See what it says.

271
00:24:28,459 --> 00:24:30,751
There. This is it.

272
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,167
What's the number.

273
00:24:33,501 --> 00:24:34,959
It's 352.

274
00:24:36,167 --> 00:24:37,250
There.

275
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:40,626
CENTER FOR ZOONOSIS CONTROL

276
00:24:40,709 --> 00:24:43,250
MONDAY TO FRIDAY
 FROM 9 AM TO 5 PM

277
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,834
This is RelÃ¢mpago.

278
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:36,918
He took RelÃ¢mpago.

279
00:25:37,042 --> 00:25:39,125
We like to call
after a few days...

280
00:25:39,125 --> 00:25:41,459
to check in and see how
the animal is getting along.

281
00:25:41,501 --> 00:25:44,000
It's just that it might take
a while to adapt to new surroundings.

282
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,626
A horse? He took a horse?

283
00:25:45,667 --> 00:25:47,292
Yeah, a great horse.

284
00:25:47,417 --> 00:25:50,292
He wasn't young,
but still very strong.

285
00:25:50,876 --> 00:25:53,584
Pedro bought a horse?

286
00:25:53,834 --> 00:25:55,292
He adopted RelÃ¢mpago.

287
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,125
What do you mean, adopted?

288
00:25:57,375 --> 00:26:00,000
He didn't pay for him,
he took the animal...

289
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,918
with the responsibility
of taking care of it.

290
00:26:01,918 --> 00:26:03,542
It's a system we have.

291
00:26:04,626 --> 00:26:06,501
Where did he take the horse?

292
00:26:06,876 --> 00:26:08,292
- To his house in the country.
- What house?

293
00:26:08,417 --> 00:26:09,667
- What country house?
- He said he was...

294
00:26:09,667 --> 00:26:10,918
- taking it to his country place.
- Pedro doesn't have...

295
00:26:10,918 --> 00:26:13,000
a house in the country.
We don't have a country home.

296
00:26:13,501 --> 00:26:15,501
- If he lied...
- He lied.

297
00:26:15,501 --> 00:26:18,000
If he didn't have the proper facilities
to take care of the animal...

298
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:20,125
- Excuse me. Let me ask you something.
- that makes things worse, because...

299
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:21,501
it goes against one
of our basic norms...

300
00:26:21,501 --> 00:26:24,209
Please. Alright, let me ask you
just one question.

301
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:28,042
Did Pedro leave an address
of this country house?

302
00:26:29,501 --> 00:26:31,918
- That's not necessary.
- It's not necessary...

303
00:26:35,501 --> 00:26:37,751
My friend, how in earth
did you let...

304
00:26:37,751 --> 00:26:40,751
a 15 year-old boy leave
with a horse?

305
00:26:40,792 --> 00:26:42,167
-15?
- Yeah, 15.

306
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:43,667
What do you mean, 15?

307
00:26:45,501 --> 00:26:48,125
This makes things a lot worse.

308
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:52,417
What's this?

309
00:26:53,542 --> 00:26:54,959
Pedro did this?

310
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:03,667
This is false.

311
00:27:04,792 --> 00:27:06,334
Can't you see?

312
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:09,542
Well, there's so many forms
to fill in...

313
00:27:09,584 --> 00:27:11,792
- so many documents...
- It's ringing. Wait.

314
00:27:12,334 --> 00:27:14,667
If your son falsified this,
that would be fraud...

315
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:16,000
- It's Pedro.
- If he falsified...

316
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,709
Hello, Pedro? Hello?

317
00:27:19,459 --> 00:27:21,250
Hello, who's talking?

318
00:27:22,709 --> 00:27:23,959
Who's talking?

319
00:27:24,334 --> 00:27:25,501
- Give it to me...
- Hello.

320
00:27:25,584 --> 00:27:27,125
That's my son's phone.
Who's talking?

321
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:29,417
Hello? Hello?

322
00:27:34,709 --> 00:27:36,918
- Yes.
- What is it, Theo?

323
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,959
You think, or you saw?

324
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:44,125
What did you see?

325
00:27:50,501 --> 00:27:51,918
- I'm going with you, Theo.
- You go home.

326
00:27:51,959 --> 00:27:53,334
- No, no. I'm going with you, Theo.
- Let me talk.

327
00:27:53,375 --> 00:27:54,959
- Listen, you have to...
- I'm going with you, Theo!

328
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,250
Branca, you have to go home.

329
00:27:56,292 --> 00:27:58,375
- No, I'm not going home.
- Let me talk. Let me talk!

330
00:27:58,417 --> 00:27:59,959
- Let me talk. You have to...
- No.

331
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:01,751
Listen to me.
You have to go home...

332
00:28:01,792 --> 00:28:03,667
because if Pedro comes back,
if he calls...

333
00:28:03,667 --> 00:28:05,709
I need you to be
at home, OK?

334
00:28:05,751 --> 00:28:07,792
- You have to go home.
- Will you bring Pedro back?

335
00:28:07,834 --> 00:28:09,375
- Are you going to bring Pedro home?
- Yes I am, I'll bring him back.

336
00:28:09,417 --> 00:28:11,000
Bring Pedro
back to me, Theo!

337
00:28:11,042 --> 00:28:13,250
- Please, Theo!
- I'll bring Pedro back home.

338
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:15,375
- I'll bring him, OK?
- Theo, bring Pedro back to me.

339
00:28:15,417 --> 00:28:17,709
OK, go on. Go on.

340
00:28:52,417 --> 00:28:54,834
Pedro? Hello?

341
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:56,626
As soon as you get
this message...

342
00:30:21,042 --> 00:30:22,250
Hey.

343
00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:36,209
It looks like an accident, huh?

344
00:30:49,667 --> 00:30:51,167
There are a bunch
of shacks here.

345
00:30:51,209 --> 00:30:52,626
In this community.

346
00:30:52,876 --> 00:30:54,626
Who knows, somebody
who lives here...

347
00:30:54,667 --> 00:30:56,709
might have seen something,
understand?

348
00:30:59,459 --> 00:31:02,083
I wish I could be
more helpful, but...

349
00:31:02,209 --> 00:31:05,292
Good luck. I hope you
find your kid.

350
00:31:08,417 --> 00:31:11,209
Thanks a lot, OK?
Good luck.

351
00:31:25,626 --> 00:31:26,709
Good morning.

352
00:31:26,876 --> 00:31:28,167
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

353
00:31:28,209 --> 00:31:31,042
I'm looking for my son,
he's just a kid.

354
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:34,501
Did you see a boy
come through here with a horse?

355
00:31:34,542 --> 00:31:37,459
No, I didn't.
I didn't see anything.

356
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:39,334
Thank you.

357
00:32:21,792 --> 00:32:24,250
Ma'am, please.
I need some help.

358
00:32:25,626 --> 00:32:27,501
There was an accident nearby...

359
00:32:27,751 --> 00:32:30,125
either Saturday or Sunday, I think...

360
00:32:30,751 --> 00:32:33,125
I'm looking for my son.
A boy.

361
00:32:33,167 --> 00:32:34,667
A 15 year-old boy,

362
00:32:34,751 --> 00:32:38,292
- maybe riding a horseÂ­
- A black horse?

363
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,959
A black horse, a black horse.
Did you see it?

364
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:46,334
- No.
- But, it was a black horse.

365
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:48,584
You said so. Did you see a boy
on a black horse?

366
00:32:48,626 --> 00:32:50,000
I didn't see anything,
but grandma did.

367
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,292
- Your grandmother saw him?
- Not my grandmother, Grandma.

368
00:32:52,334 --> 00:32:53,876
- Where does she live?
- She lives over there.

369
00:32:53,918 --> 00:32:55,876
- Can you take me there?
- But, now?

370
00:32:55,918 --> 00:32:58,542
Now, now. Please.

371
00:33:04,459 --> 00:33:06,709
He slept here, mister.
Like a rock.

372
00:33:06,876 --> 00:33:08,918
- Malina, wake up.
- Malina!

373
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:12,834
- Malina!
- It's mine! Get up!

374
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:15,042
You can't do that.

375
00:33:15,667 --> 00:33:18,375
Didn't he tell you
where he was going...

376
00:33:19,083 --> 00:33:20,918
or what he was doing
with this horse?

377
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:23,542
Didn't say anything, mister.
Here, Quico, give him his bottle.

378
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:25,834
- Listen ma'am...
- He hurt his leg.

379
00:33:25,876 --> 00:33:27,167
He hurt his leg?

380
00:33:27,209 --> 00:33:28,501
Yeah, and I didn't have
anything for it.

381
00:33:28,501 --> 00:33:30,167
- I gave him some tea.
- Ma'am, just a second.

382
00:33:30,209 --> 00:33:31,542
How did he hurt his leg?

383
00:33:31,584 --> 00:33:33,459
It was scratched up very bad.

384
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:36,459
Ma'am, could I ask you
to hold it still just for a bit?

385
00:33:36,501 --> 00:33:37,584
Just a bit, please.

386
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:39,375
Was he alright?

387
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:41,542
He was alright, mister.
He sleept, woke up,

388
00:33:41,542 --> 00:33:44,125
ate like a pig,
grabbed his things and left.

389
00:33:44,167 --> 00:33:46,459
- Where did he go?
- Only Beto would know that.

390
00:33:46,501 --> 00:33:49,209
- Who is Beto, ma'am?
- Who is Beto? Beto is Beto, mister!

391
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:51,459
Malina, take him
over to Beto's place.

392
00:33:51,876 --> 00:33:53,375
- But, now?
- Now!

393
00:33:55,876 --> 00:33:57,125
Let's go.

394
00:33:57,501 --> 00:33:58,918
Don't want it, don't drink it.

395
00:34:14,542 --> 00:34:15,708
Beto?

396
00:34:18,208 --> 00:34:20,918
- Beto!
- I'm coming.

397
00:34:21,667 --> 00:34:23,375
OK, this is fine.

398
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:25,458
- You see that road there?
- That one?

399
00:34:25,542 --> 00:34:26,792
Yes! Follow it.

400
00:34:27,292 --> 00:34:28,876
That's where your boy went.

401
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,792
Horses are made for dirt roads,
not for traffic.

402
00:34:32,833 --> 00:34:34,208
The horse shied.

403
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:38,208
I've seen lots of folks get killed
by animals on the asphalt.

404
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:40,250
Didn't he say anything
about where he was going?

405
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,501
Salvador.

406
00:34:48,626 --> 00:34:50,292
He's going to Salvador?

407
00:34:52,751 --> 00:34:55,000
No, EspÃ­rito Santo.

408
00:34:55,501 --> 00:34:57,876
Salvador or EspÃ­rito Santo?

409
00:34:57,918 --> 00:35:00,000
Salvador or EspÃ­rito Santo.

410
00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:04,209
That's it, without a doubt.

411
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:07,250
One or the other,
both down that road.

412
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:20,501
Theo?

413
00:35:20,792 --> 00:35:24,501
Everything's OK, Branca.
He's alright. No problem. He's alive.

414
00:35:26,918 --> 00:35:28,167
He's alive, Theo?

415
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,667
He spent the night
at this woman's house.

416
00:35:29,709 --> 00:35:31,542
I met her.
He left early the next day.

417
00:35:31,584 --> 00:35:33,918
- She doesn't know where he's going.
- He's OK?

418
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:35,792
He hurt his leg...

419
00:35:36,709 --> 00:35:38,542
Just a scratch, a scratch.

420
00:35:38,626 --> 00:35:40,459
I don't know.
I'm going to follow this road here.

421
00:35:40,459 --> 00:35:41,876
That guy doesn't know
what he's talking about.

422
00:35:41,918 --> 00:35:43,959
First he says he's going to Bahia then,
that he's headed to EspÃ­rito Santo.

423
00:35:43,959 --> 00:35:46,292
I mean...
We just don't know, man.

424
00:35:46,709 --> 00:35:48,709
- Where is he headed?
- Theo I...

425
00:35:48,709 --> 00:35:51,584
looked through his whole room,
his computer isn't here.

426
00:35:51,584 --> 00:35:53,167
I don't know where it is.

427
00:35:53,167 --> 00:35:54,667
So, send him a message then.

428
00:35:54,709 --> 00:35:57,375
Send him a message, who knows,
he might still have it and...

429
00:35:57,417 --> 00:35:59,501
- he answers.
- Alright.

430
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,292
You find him, OK?

431
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:03,959
Find him and bring him home.

432
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,417
Hey!

433
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,375
Hey!

434
00:37:08,876 --> 00:37:10,083
Mister!

435
00:37:10,334 --> 00:37:14,459
Did you see a boy come
through this way on a horse?

436
00:37:15,334 --> 00:37:17,167
- Yeah!
- You saw him?

437
00:37:17,876 --> 00:37:20,667
- Yeah.
- When did you see him?

438
00:37:21,417 --> 00:37:24,626
- He crossed yesterday.
- Crossed to where?

439
00:37:25,167 --> 00:37:26,417
To the other side.

440
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,959
How'd he cross?

441
00:37:30,584 --> 00:37:32,250
I crossed him.

442
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:34,542
- In that?
- Here.

443
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:37,542
Him and the horse. Why?

444
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:40,542
Could you cross...?
Could you ferry...?

445
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:42,709
Will that thing hold my car?

446
00:37:43,042 --> 00:37:45,417
Hold your car, for sure,
but there's no way.

447
00:37:45,459 --> 00:37:46,626
Why?

448
00:37:47,459 --> 00:37:49,834
- The tide is low.
- No, we can do it.

449
00:37:50,083 --> 00:37:52,626
We can do it. I'll help you.
We can do it.

450
00:37:52,876 --> 00:37:55,501
- No way.
- I'll help you. The two of us...

451
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,125
We'll push.

452
00:37:57,167 --> 00:37:58,667
Can you make it here?

453
00:37:59,375 --> 00:38:01,751
Hold it.
Listen ma'am, it's my son.

454
00:38:01,792 --> 00:38:04,334
The boy is my son. Please.

455
00:38:04,542 --> 00:38:06,709
Bring the boat
over here, please?

456
00:38:07,584 --> 00:38:08,792
Please.

457
00:38:09,334 --> 00:38:10,834
I'll help you, the two of us.

458
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:16,042
If you push here, it'll go.
Look here.

459
00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:18,334
Back there, if you...

460
00:38:18,459 --> 00:38:21,918
Look. It's shallow here.
Look here, if you...

461
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:23,501
Mister, it's no use.

462
00:38:23,542 --> 00:38:26,250
If you just help me...
If you help me, we can do it.

463
00:38:26,292 --> 00:38:29,542
It's just a matter of
pushing here, look.

464
00:38:29,584 --> 00:38:31,125
If I put, if I put the pole...

465
00:38:47,417 --> 00:38:48,918
You got a dinghy or something?

466
00:40:06,125 --> 00:40:07,876
Did you talk to him?

467
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:10,375
He asked me
what horses eat.

468
00:40:12,918 --> 00:40:15,375
- He didn't know?
- No.

469
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,501
Did he tell you
anything?

470
00:40:23,959 --> 00:40:26,417
Did he say where he was headed?
Anything.

471
00:40:26,959 --> 00:40:28,792
He asked me for a discount
for the horse.

472
00:40:29,501 --> 00:40:32,792
He didn't think that a horse
had to pay the same as people.

473
00:40:32,876 --> 00:40:33,918
"RelÃ¢mpadu."

474
00:40:35,501 --> 00:40:37,918
- Did he say "relÃ¢mpago"?
- Du.

475
00:40:38,292 --> 00:40:40,501
RelÃ¢mpago is the name
of Pedro's horse.

476
00:40:40,501 --> 00:40:42,417
Did he say the horse's name?

477
00:40:42,876 --> 00:40:44,584
- "RelÃ¢mpadu."
- RelÃ¢mpago.

478
00:40:45,083 --> 00:40:46,083
RelÃ¢mpago.

479
00:40:46,959 --> 00:40:48,501
Yeah, did you see the horse?

480
00:40:50,209 --> 00:40:51,417
Pedro's horse?

481
00:40:52,459 --> 00:40:57,375
Is this the boy
with the horse you saw?

482
00:40:59,792 --> 00:41:01,834
But horses
weigh more than people.

483
00:41:02,709 --> 00:41:05,209
If it had been anyone else,
I'd charge the horse...

484
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,876
near to what I'd charge for a car.

485
00:41:07,167 --> 00:41:08,709
He was broke?

486
00:41:09,375 --> 00:41:10,876
No, he had money.

487
00:41:12,959 --> 00:41:14,709
Then later, he wanted my cap.

488
00:41:16,959 --> 00:41:18,709
Offered me 20 reais for it.

489
00:41:19,751 --> 00:41:21,542
But I wouldn't sell my cap.

490
00:41:26,959 --> 00:41:29,501
- He wanted to buy that cap?
- Yeah.

491
00:41:30,792 --> 00:41:33,167
- That one there?
- Right.

492
00:41:45,125 --> 00:41:46,459
Want one?

493
00:42:17,375 --> 00:42:19,000
You guys live here
on the boat?

494
00:42:19,834 --> 00:42:21,250
For a long time now.

495
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:32,542
And that's your boy?

496
00:42:34,834 --> 00:42:35,959
Yeah.

497
00:42:37,167 --> 00:42:38,334
Pedro.

498
00:42:40,542 --> 00:42:41,751
Doesn't look like him.

499
00:42:43,959 --> 00:42:45,501
It's just that he's only...

500
00:42:46,542 --> 00:42:48,959
- How old is your boy?
- Five.

501
00:42:49,709 --> 00:42:51,876
Yeah, five. Five, six...

502
00:42:53,209 --> 00:42:54,250
Younger.

503
00:42:55,709 --> 00:42:57,918
Don't look anything like
the guy on the horse.

504
00:43:07,292 --> 00:43:08,375
He grew up.

505
00:44:37,626 --> 00:44:38,667
Hey.

506
00:44:40,667 --> 00:44:43,542
You can keep the tractor.
Sorry for the trouble, I...

507
00:44:43,542 --> 00:44:45,000
- Where did you get that T-shirt?
- Keep it.

508
00:44:45,042 --> 00:44:46,959
- Keep the tractor.
- That T-shirt belongs to my boy.

509
00:44:46,959 --> 00:44:48,876
- I took it just for this one job.
- Why are you running?

510
00:44:48,918 --> 00:44:50,792
- You can keep it.
- Hey!

511
00:44:50,834 --> 00:44:52,083
- Keep it!
- Hey!

512
00:44:54,959 --> 00:44:55,959
Hey!

513
00:45:13,417 --> 00:45:15,626
Where's my boy?
Where's Pedro?

514
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:21,584
Are you crazy?

515
00:45:24,542 --> 00:45:26,042
Are you from Town Hall?

516
00:45:31,167 --> 00:45:32,751
Mister, are you from
the Town Hall?

517
00:45:35,667 --> 00:45:36,751
My boy.

518
00:45:37,042 --> 00:45:40,709
- Where's Pedro?
- Let me go, let me go!

519
00:45:42,375 --> 00:45:44,834
- Are you crazy, shit? Are you crazy?
- Where's my son?

520
00:45:44,876 --> 00:45:46,584
- Are you crazy, shit?
- Where's Pedro?

521
00:45:46,584 --> 00:45:47,626
What Pedro?

522
00:45:47,667 --> 00:45:49,667
Where's Pedro?
Where's Pedro?

523
00:45:49,834 --> 00:45:50,834
Pedro?

524
00:45:50,834 --> 00:45:52,292
The kid who
owned this T-shirt?

525
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:55,250
You are fighting me because
of this fucking T-shirt!

526
00:45:55,542 --> 00:45:58,125
I thought you were
from the Town Hall, shit!

527
00:45:59,834 --> 00:46:02,042
I traded this shirt with Pedro.

528
00:46:02,709 --> 00:46:05,083
The kid came by and traded me
a bottle of pinga for it.

529
00:46:07,542 --> 00:46:08,918
For God's sake.

530
00:46:10,375 --> 00:46:11,834
I thought you were...

531
00:46:13,918 --> 00:46:16,125
He headed that way,
down that road.

532
00:46:16,459 --> 00:46:18,834
Go on after him.
You can catch up to him.

533
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:30,334
Go on!

534
00:46:55,584 --> 00:46:56,834
They're here, Mrs. Branca.

535
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:59,167
- What's that?
- Tiles.

536
00:46:59,792 --> 00:47:01,125
What do we do
with the tiles?

537
00:47:22,501 --> 00:47:25,334
WHERE ARE YOU?

538
00:47:29,584 --> 00:47:32,626
CALL HOME
WE'RE DESPERATE...

539
00:47:37,292 --> 00:47:40,083
GIVE SOME SIGN PEDRO...

540
00:47:58,542 --> 00:47:59,709
Good morning.

541
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:05,959
Did you, by any chance, see a kid
come through here on a horse?

542
00:48:07,083 --> 00:48:09,626
Would you know where I can
find a telephone around here?

543
00:48:37,959 --> 00:48:39,083
Ma'am?

544
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:40,375
Good morning.

545
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:44,167
Could you tell me where I might
find a phone around here?

546
00:48:51,751 --> 00:48:53,667
- Telephone?
- Telephone.

547
00:48:54,626 --> 00:48:58,292
A telephone here,
only with CustÃ³dio.

548
00:48:58,918 --> 00:49:01,876
- Where does CustÃ³dio live?
- Next door.

549
00:49:02,125 --> 00:49:03,501
This house here?

550
00:49:03,667 --> 00:49:04,834
Thank you.

551
00:49:08,792 --> 00:49:09,959
CustÃ³dio?

552
00:49:18,417 --> 00:49:20,125
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

553
00:49:20,959 --> 00:49:23,959
Mr. CustÃ³dio,
my name is Theo, Theo Gadelha.

554
00:49:24,292 --> 00:49:27,709
Your neighbor told me
that you have a phone.

555
00:49:27,792 --> 00:49:30,459
I'm looking for my son, a boy...

556
00:49:31,292 --> 00:49:35,375
who's disappeared. He might have
come through here, on a horse.

557
00:49:35,417 --> 00:49:38,292
Have you seen a boy
coming by here on a horse?

558
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:41,209
- A boy on a horse?
- A boy on a black horse.

559
00:49:41,918 --> 00:49:44,542
Horses come by here
all the time.

560
00:49:44,584 --> 00:49:47,000
I can't remember
all the colors, right?

561
00:49:47,667 --> 00:49:50,501
Could you lend me your phone,
please?

562
00:49:50,584 --> 00:49:52,000
I have to call my wife.

563
00:50:26,209 --> 00:50:27,584
Is it working?

564
00:50:31,667 --> 00:50:34,667
- What's wrong?
- No credit.

565
00:50:34,834 --> 00:50:37,250
But, it won't be long, Mr.
CustÃ³dio. I'll make it real quick.

566
00:50:37,292 --> 00:50:39,417
No, I can't run out
of credit.

567
00:50:39,459 --> 00:50:40,876
My daughter
doesn't like it.

568
00:50:41,334 --> 00:50:43,751
No problem.
This is what we'll do...

569
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:48,292
I'll give you some money
and you buy some more credit.

570
00:50:48,292 --> 00:50:50,584
No. They don't sell it here.

571
00:50:50,918 --> 00:50:51,959
Where did you
buy this credit?

572
00:50:51,959 --> 00:50:53,042
My daughter.

573
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:55,584
Your daughter. So we'll give...
I'll even get some more here.

574
00:50:55,626 --> 00:50:56,918
We'll give her more money.

575
00:50:56,918 --> 00:50:58,459
With this, you can
even buy a new phone.

576
00:50:58,501 --> 00:51:01,250
My daughter
only gets here on Friday.

577
00:51:03,292 --> 00:51:04,626
Mr. CustÃ³dio...

578
00:51:07,751 --> 00:51:11,209
- I really need your help.
- I can't.

579
00:51:16,042 --> 00:51:18,375
I use a pacemaker.

580
00:51:19,459 --> 00:51:22,792
If there's any problem,
I have to call my daughter.

581
00:51:32,792 --> 00:51:34,375
I know what we can do.

582
00:51:35,584 --> 00:51:39,459
Right, there's no problem.
I'll just make a collect call.

583
00:51:39,501 --> 00:51:41,167
- You know what a collect call is?
- No, no, no.

584
00:51:41,167 --> 00:51:42,209
I'll explain it to you...

585
00:51:42,209 --> 00:51:43,250
Just for you to understand.

586
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:44,417
The call is collect, you don't pay.

587
00:51:44,417 --> 00:51:47,375
- You know what a collect call is?
- It'd be better not to.

588
00:51:47,417 --> 00:51:49,167
Do you know what a collect call is?

589
00:51:49,167 --> 00:51:51,834
It'd be better if you just left.

590
00:51:55,584 --> 00:51:58,334
- That doesn't make any sense.
- It would be better.

591
00:52:01,584 --> 00:52:04,709
- Are you trying to give me a hard time?
- I already told you mister.

592
00:52:04,792 --> 00:52:06,250
My daughter wouldn't like it.

593
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:08,334
And I already told you that
you won't have to pay anything.

594
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:09,417
Are you deaf?

595
00:52:14,751 --> 00:52:16,834
I'm not deaf,

596
00:52:17,709 --> 00:52:19,459
I have a heart condition.

597
00:52:19,584 --> 00:52:20,876
And you can leave now!

598
00:52:36,834 --> 00:52:38,167
I'll leave the money here.

599
00:52:38,167 --> 00:52:40,000
I need to find my son.
I'm really sorry about this.

600
00:52:40,375 --> 00:52:42,083
You can buy a new phone.

601
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:44,751
Are you crazy?
Come back here!

602
00:52:44,792 --> 00:52:47,375
Hey, buddy!

603
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:49,751
Stop! Stop!

604
00:52:49,751 --> 00:52:52,000
Come back here!
Come back here, young man!

605
00:52:55,209 --> 00:52:57,209
Help me! Help me!
Help me!

606
00:52:57,959 --> 00:52:59,667
Come back here!
That's my phone!

607
00:53:00,876 --> 00:53:02,292
Stop! Stop!

608
00:53:40,292 --> 00:53:42,501
- Hello, Theo?
- He's OK, Branca.

609
00:53:42,542 --> 00:53:44,751
He's OK. Believe me...

610
00:53:44,751 --> 00:53:47,626
- He crossed a river.
- What river, Theo?

611
00:53:47,626 --> 00:53:49,459
A river... in a mangrove...

612
00:53:49,501 --> 00:53:51,417
He crossed on a ferry.
I talked to the owner of the ferry.

613
00:53:51,417 --> 00:53:53,667
They guy told me that he talked to him,
he had money and he was alright.

614
00:53:53,709 --> 00:53:55,542
He wanted to
buy the guy's cap.

615
00:53:55,792 --> 00:53:57,000
- And he's alright?
- Branca,

616
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,459
I've met two people
who have talked to Pedro already.

617
00:53:59,459 --> 00:54:02,209
He traded his T-shirt...
He's fine. He's getting along.

618
00:54:02,876 --> 00:54:05,000
Find him for me.
Bring him home.

619
00:54:05,042 --> 00:54:06,501
I'm going to take him
home today.

620
00:54:06,501 --> 00:54:08,542
I'm getting close.
I'm real close now.

621
00:54:08,792 --> 00:54:09,959
I'm on a hurry.

622
00:54:22,709 --> 00:54:24,334
Hey! Hey! Guy!

623
00:54:24,751 --> 00:54:27,667
Mister, mister. Please, please.
Could you give us a lift?

624
00:54:27,667 --> 00:54:29,083
We ran out of gas.

625
00:54:30,334 --> 00:54:32,250
- Where are you going man?
- I'm going to Mimoso.

626
00:54:32,292 --> 00:54:33,959
It's a festival,
not far from here.

627
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,459
- And what's going on there?
- Lots of music, lots of rock.

628
00:54:36,542 --> 00:54:37,834
Very crazy.

629
00:54:38,959 --> 00:54:40,709
And guys, like your age,
are going there?

630
00:54:40,709 --> 00:54:42,584
Yeah, basically,
just people our age.

631
00:54:42,626 --> 00:54:44,959
And there are some friends of mine
too. Hold on, let me call them.

632
00:54:47,334 --> 00:54:48,834
- Mimoso?
- It's not far.

633
00:54:48,834 --> 00:54:50,167
You have to go through here.

634
00:54:50,375 --> 00:54:53,000
Hey, man. Are you going to do us
this favor, give us a lift?

635
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,542
- You'll take us to Mimoso?
- Hold it.

636
00:54:54,542 --> 00:54:55,876
Where are you going?

637
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:58,083
- Where am I going?
- Yeah.

638
00:54:58,959 --> 00:55:01,292
- That's a good question.
- You don't know?

639
00:55:01,292 --> 00:55:02,334
Do us a favor man.

640
00:55:02,375 --> 00:55:03,834
Take us to Mimoso.
It's not far.

641
00:55:04,083 --> 00:55:06,834
- I'm looking for my son.
- What do you mean? You lost him?

642
00:55:08,042 --> 00:55:09,250
I lost him.

643
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,042
But, I'm going to find him.

644
00:55:11,042 --> 00:55:13,167
He's a kid your age.

645
00:55:13,292 --> 00:55:16,584
A bit younger. He's on a horse.

646
00:55:16,584 --> 00:55:17,709
On a horse.

647
00:55:17,751 --> 00:55:20,250
Man, he's going to Mimoso
for sure. The Winter Festival.

648
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,626
Filled with kids our age.

649
00:55:21,626 --> 00:55:23,125
Who knows, you just might
find him there.

650
00:55:23,167 --> 00:55:25,083
- He's in Mimoso for sure man.
- Let's go? Let's go?

651
00:55:25,083 --> 00:55:27,667
- Let's go to Mimoso.
- Let's go guys. Let's go. Come on.

652
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:30,667
Let's go to Mimoso.

653
00:55:30,792 --> 00:55:32,501
Hold it a second.

654
00:55:33,042 --> 00:55:37,501
- Come on, come on.
- Real quick, man. Not many things.

655
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:40,501
Go, go, hurry.
Come on, China. Move it man.

656
00:55:40,709 --> 00:55:42,125
There, that's it. Go, go.

657
00:55:42,167 --> 00:55:44,709
- Get in. Get in.
- There, that's all.

658
00:55:46,209 --> 00:55:47,959
Thanks a lot, really man.

659
00:55:49,626 --> 00:55:50,792
Let's go, let's go.

660
00:55:50,834 --> 00:55:52,125
Where are you guys coming from?

661
00:55:52,167 --> 00:55:53,667
- Belo Horizonte.
- BH.

662
00:55:53,709 --> 00:55:56,000
- BH is very far from here, huh?
- More or less.

663
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,292
- Didn't take us long.
- No big deal.

664
00:55:59,125 --> 00:56:00,667
And that car, whose father
does it belong to?

665
00:56:00,709 --> 00:56:02,000
Mine.

666
00:56:02,375 --> 00:56:04,584
And you're going to just leave it
in the middle of the road?

667
00:56:04,626 --> 00:56:06,584
It's all locked.
No problem.

668
00:56:06,626 --> 00:56:08,918
- Nobody is going to steal it, no way.
- I'm feeling bad.

669
00:56:08,918 --> 00:56:12,167
- So you just take it easy there.
- That's what I'm doing.

670
00:56:12,167 --> 00:56:14,918
- Don't hassle me.
- Are you OK?

671
00:56:14,959 --> 00:56:16,501
- He's feeling queasy.
- Poor thing.

672
00:56:16,542 --> 00:56:18,417
Chocolate isn't very good if
you're feeling queasy man.

673
00:56:18,459 --> 00:56:20,000
- You got chocolate man?
- Give it to me.

674
00:56:23,125 --> 00:56:24,250
It's my chocolate.

675
00:56:29,959 --> 00:56:31,250
Want some?

676
00:56:55,584 --> 00:56:57,459
Thanks a lot, man.

677
00:56:57,501 --> 00:56:59,000
Thanks a lot. Really.

678
00:57:29,417 --> 00:57:32,292
Hi. Hi. I'm going to ask you
Just one thing.

679
00:57:32,709 --> 00:57:34,083
Money.

680
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,459
It's because I lost my purse...

681
00:57:36,501 --> 00:57:38,542
and I'll find it, but
it's going to take some time.

682
00:57:38,584 --> 00:57:40,626
And I need a ham and
cheese sandwich right now.

683
00:57:40,667 --> 00:57:43,000
- Ham and cheese?
- Yeah, ham and cheese.

684
00:57:44,542 --> 00:57:45,918
I'm looking for my son.

685
00:57:45,959 --> 00:57:48,792
Man, this place is filled with sons.
Take your pick.

686
00:57:49,292 --> 00:57:51,501
But my son is different.
My son...

687
00:57:52,918 --> 00:57:54,792
My son
has a black horse.

688
00:57:54,834 --> 00:57:58,918
A horse? No way.
I was sure it was just some story.

689
00:57:58,959 --> 00:58:00,792
You mean that he really
did come on a horse?

690
00:58:00,792 --> 00:58:01,876
Maura took a whole bunch...

691
00:58:01,918 --> 00:58:03,375
- of pictures with him.
- Who's Maura?

692
00:58:03,417 --> 00:58:04,709
And you know how it is,

693
00:58:04,751 --> 00:58:06,083
not everything Maura tells me is...

694
00:58:06,083 --> 00:58:07,751
- Where is she?
- At Patrick's.

695
00:58:07,751 --> 00:58:09,751
- Can you take me there?
- Sure.

696
00:58:09,876 --> 00:58:13,501
But can you buy me a sandwich?
Please, I'm starving to death.

697
00:58:13,501 --> 00:58:16,209
I took an acid yesterday
and the festival is today...

698
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:18,918
What? Don't tell me
you've never done that?

699
00:58:22,167 --> 00:58:25,375
Thanks a lot
for this sandwich, really.

700
00:58:25,501 --> 00:58:27,709
- Stop there, please.
- At this gate here?

701
00:58:27,751 --> 00:58:30,292
I'll open it, you can park
near the trailer.

702
00:58:58,250 --> 00:58:59,626
My bed.

703
00:59:03,083 --> 00:59:05,501
This guy lives here, this Patrick?

704
00:59:05,501 --> 00:59:08,250
Patrick was my French teacher
at school.

705
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:09,918
- You know SÃ£o Fernando?
- Yeah.

706
00:59:09,959 --> 00:59:14,834
During summer vacation, he bought a
whole bag of acid and came to Mimoso.

707
00:59:15,292 --> 00:59:17,751
And, a couple bags later,
he's still here.

708
00:59:19,459 --> 00:59:24,292
- Does your father know you're here?
- Here, exactly, I sure hope not.

709
00:59:25,459 --> 00:59:26,626
- Let's go?
- Let's go.

710
00:59:26,876 --> 00:59:28,542
They probably are in the river.

711
00:59:36,709 --> 00:59:38,250
- Patrick.
- How's it going?

712
00:59:38,292 --> 00:59:39,584
- Ãa va?
- Ãa va bien.

713
00:59:39,584 --> 00:59:41,792
- Ãa va bien.
- Ãa va bien.

714
00:59:41,959 --> 00:59:44,501
Patrick, I'm Theo.

715
00:59:44,834 --> 00:59:46,542
Patrick. And so?

716
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:48,834
- The girl...
- Alice.

717
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:50,083
- Alice.
- Alice.

718
00:59:50,459 --> 00:59:53,459
She told me that my boy slept here,
at your campground.

719
00:59:53,626 --> 00:59:55,334
- And who is your boy?
- Pedro.

720
00:59:55,501 --> 00:59:58,042
Pedro? God!

721
00:59:58,626 --> 01:00:01,250
- How did he do that, huh?
- The thing with the horse?

722
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:05,542
- A whim. An insane trip.
- I'd like to know that too.

723
01:00:05,959 --> 01:00:07,375
An insane trip.

724
01:00:08,375 --> 01:00:10,459
Is he around? Where is he?
Is he still here?

725
01:00:10,542 --> 01:00:11,876
He left.

726
01:00:14,292 --> 01:00:16,959
This one doesn't work.

727
01:00:18,292 --> 01:00:19,501
Have to take it to...

728
01:00:20,459 --> 01:00:22,250
- He's already gone?
- Yeah.

729
01:00:26,959 --> 01:00:28,292
Do you know where?

730
01:00:30,709 --> 01:00:33,709
He was in a hurry.
Said he couldn't stay.

731
01:00:34,876 --> 01:00:37,375
I even joked around with him.
I told him...

732
01:00:37,417 --> 01:00:39,876
"If you're in a hurry,
going by horseback...

733
01:00:39,918 --> 01:00:42,751
isn't the fastest means
of transportation, right?"

734
01:00:44,334 --> 01:00:46,209
But then I started thinking
to get up...

735
01:00:46,334 --> 01:00:49,292
and leave before the party,
he must have been in a hurry.

736
01:00:49,334 --> 01:00:52,959
- But, did he spend the night here?
- Yeah, he spent the night.

737
01:00:53,876 --> 01:00:55,459
He bunked down in Maura's tent.

738
01:00:55,876 --> 01:01:00,375
The two of them got
real cozy, you know? So cute.

739
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:04,000
That's Maura.
Maura!

740
01:01:04,292 --> 01:01:07,250
Stop it! Stop it!
You creeps, no!

741
01:01:08,501 --> 01:01:09,542
Go there.

742
01:01:10,042 --> 01:01:11,375
No, no, no.

743
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:13,000
Take me back.

744
01:01:16,709 --> 01:01:18,292
Man, it hurts so bad.

745
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Maura? My name is Theo.
Pedro's father.

746
01:01:24,959 --> 01:01:27,250
You don't look like Pedro, do you?

747
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:28,918
Cissa, take me back
into the water, please.

748
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:30,501
- Help me back into the river?
- Aren't you cold?

749
01:01:30,542 --> 01:01:32,626
- No. My baby is going to be born.
- No.

750
01:01:32,667 --> 01:01:33,876
I want him to be
born in the river.

751
01:01:33,918 --> 01:01:35,292
- Are you cold?
- Can you take me to the river?

752
01:01:35,334 --> 01:01:36,959
Your baby can't be
born in the river.

753
01:01:36,959 --> 01:01:38,000
Yes, he can. I want...

754
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,292
- to have him in the water.
- No, no he can't.

755
01:01:39,334 --> 01:01:40,417
It's too cold.

756
01:01:42,375 --> 01:01:44,125
This girl has got to go
to a hospital, Patrick.

757
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:46,167
That'd be the SÃ£o Pedro Hospital.
Two hour drive from here.

758
01:01:46,167 --> 01:01:47,667
No, I'm not going
to any hospital.

759
01:01:47,667 --> 01:01:50,042
No way! My boy is going to be
born here! I want him to be...

760
01:01:50,083 --> 01:01:52,083
- Hold it, Maura, Maura.
- Take me to the river!

761
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,667
Hold it, let me talk
with you.

762
01:01:53,709 --> 01:01:55,584
You can't have
your baby in the river.

763
01:01:55,626 --> 01:01:57,334
You can't do that, understand?
It's too cold.

764
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:59,709
But I'm right here to help you, OK?
I'm going to help you.

765
01:01:59,751 --> 01:02:01,000
I'm a doctor and
I'm going to help you.

766
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,083
- No. No doctors, no doctors.
- No, no, no. No, doctor no.

767
01:02:03,083 --> 01:02:05,167
I'm Pedro's father.
I'm Pedro's father.

768
01:02:05,209 --> 01:02:06,959
And look, we're right
beside the river.

769
01:02:06,959 --> 01:02:08,876
The river is right here beside us.
You don't need to get any closer.

770
01:02:08,876 --> 01:02:09,918
OK?
Can you hear the water?

771
01:02:09,959 --> 01:02:11,083
Tell everyone to be quiet,
everyone.

772
01:02:11,083 --> 01:02:13,375
Hey guys, move back.
Move back. Take it easy.

773
01:02:13,417 --> 01:02:15,250
- Let's listen to the river.
- Move!

774
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:23,918
Can you hear it?
We're right beside the river.

775
01:02:24,334 --> 01:02:26,459
Your baby is going
to be born by the river.

776
01:02:27,751 --> 01:02:29,125
OK?
Patrick.

777
01:02:29,459 --> 01:02:32,083
Get me some towels,
or clean cloth...

778
01:02:32,125 --> 01:02:33,626
- a pan full of boiling water.
- Right.

779
01:02:33,626 --> 01:02:34,667
Wait, Patrick.

780
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:36,667
Some scissors and alcohol.

781
01:02:36,834 --> 01:02:38,375
That pinga there will do.

782
01:02:38,959 --> 01:02:41,042
- To wash my hands.
- No.

783
01:02:41,083 --> 01:02:43,292
- So, I don't look like Pedro?
- No.

784
01:02:43,375 --> 01:02:46,209
- Pedro is better looking than me?
- Yeah. BetterÂ­

785
01:02:46,417 --> 01:02:48,584
I want you to open your legs
a bit more, OK?

786
01:02:48,626 --> 01:02:52,751
Just a bit more. Like this.
I'm right here with you, OK?

787
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
We're going to do this
together, right?

788
01:02:55,125 --> 01:02:56,334
I'm here to help you.

789
01:02:56,375 --> 01:02:57,584
And now do one more thing.

790
01:02:57,584 --> 01:03:00,167
Open your legs just a bit more.
Can you do that?

791
01:03:00,501 --> 01:03:02,083
I know, it hurts. That's it.

792
01:03:02,125 --> 01:03:04,000
- That's it, right. Just a bit.
- It hurts.

793
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,959
We're going to do this together,
alright? Both of us.

794
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,334
I'm here to help you.

795
01:03:08,584 --> 01:03:11,709
Every time a contraction starts,
you are going to push it, OK?

796
01:03:12,417 --> 01:03:14,709
OK? OK? Right, now. Go on.

797
01:03:14,751 --> 01:03:17,667
That's it! That's it!
That's it, Maura.

798
01:03:17,959 --> 01:03:21,042
Right, like that.
Just like that, right.

799
01:03:21,125 --> 01:03:24,250
Now take a deep breath. Look at
the river. Listen to the river.

800
01:03:24,334 --> 01:03:27,459
We're here together.
Take it easy, everything will be fine.

801
01:03:27,751 --> 01:03:30,250
I'm here with you.
Go on, the baby is coming.

802
01:03:30,334 --> 01:03:32,250
It's coming.
It's coming already.

803
01:03:32,292 --> 01:03:33,334
Go on now,

804
01:03:33,334 --> 01:03:35,959
once again, that's it!
That's it, Maura!

805
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,375
That's it. I can feel his
head right here.

806
01:03:38,417 --> 01:03:39,417
He's coming out.

807
01:03:39,501 --> 01:03:41,417
That's it, Maura.

808
01:03:41,459 --> 01:03:44,584
That's it.
He's right here, he's coming out.

809
01:03:44,876 --> 01:03:46,709
Now breath in deep,
he'll come out the next time now.

810
01:03:46,709 --> 01:03:48,209
The next time he'll be born.
He wants to be born.

811
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:50,667
- It hurts so much.
- I know it hurts, I know.

812
01:03:50,709 --> 01:03:53,000
We'll do this together.
I'm right here with you.

813
01:03:53,042 --> 01:03:54,459
OK? Let's go.

814
01:03:54,709 --> 01:03:56,125
That's it, right.

815
01:03:56,375 --> 01:03:59,584
Push hard! Harder!
Push hard, go on.

816
01:04:00,834 --> 01:04:02,876
That's it. He's coming out.

817
01:04:02,918 --> 01:04:05,459
There, Maura! That's it!
Like that.

818
01:04:05,501 --> 01:04:07,792
He's coming out. Now!
That's it.

819
01:04:07,834 --> 01:04:09,083
Here, he's here.

820
01:04:10,292 --> 01:04:13,792
He's born. He's born.
He's right here, here.

821
01:07:08,792 --> 01:07:10,292
The garbage truck's here.

822
01:07:10,709 --> 01:07:11,876
Want me to throw this away?

823
01:07:13,834 --> 01:07:15,167
Throw it away.

824
01:07:55,167 --> 01:07:56,459
55 PIRATININGA STREET
SÃO PAULO

825
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:10,000
MISSING HIM REMINDED ME
OF OTHER THINGS I MISSED

826
01:08:15,209 --> 01:08:18,250
HUGS
YOUR GRANDPA

827
01:08:33,626 --> 01:08:38,459
"My present mug.
And yours, what's it like?"

828
01:08:40,626 --> 01:08:44,125
"I've always thought that the
less you have,

829
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:45,917
the less you lose.

830
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,542
So, all I had was a horse.

831
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:53,082
An old horse, not much
good for anything.

832
01:08:53,167 --> 01:08:56,501
But then, my horse died."

833
01:09:08,542 --> 01:09:09,834
Hold it!

834
01:09:10,959 --> 01:09:13,125
Wait! Wait a second!
Hold it!

835
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,042
- Branca?
- Theo, it's me, Branca.

836
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:38,626
Theo, he went to
his grandfather's place.

837
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:41,209
Pedro went to
your father's house.

838
01:09:42,292 --> 01:09:45,250
He went to EspÃ­rito Santo, to your
father's country place.

839
01:09:45,501 --> 01:09:47,876
He and your father were
sending each other drawings.

840
01:09:48,334 --> 01:09:50,792
They've been in touch,
they've talked to each other.

841
01:09:51,125 --> 01:09:52,542
For a long time now.

842
01:09:53,082 --> 01:09:56,125
Theo, pay attention.
Write it down. Listen, it's...

843
01:09:56,876 --> 01:10:00,792
Ponta Negra, Km 187.

844
01:10:03,042 --> 01:10:04,250
Did you get that?

845
01:10:05,209 --> 01:10:09,083
Theo, this is about Pedro now, OK?

846
01:10:10,459 --> 01:10:13,667
The rest is the rest.
You can see about that later.

847
01:11:22,876 --> 01:11:24,167
Can you hear me?

848
01:14:04,334 --> 01:14:06,375
Get in the car.
I'm taking you to the hospital.

849
01:14:06,959 --> 01:14:08,042
Where's my car?

850
01:14:08,083 --> 01:14:10,626
What were you doing in
the middle of the road like that?

851
01:14:13,626 --> 01:14:15,125
I have to find my boy.

852
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:17,459
Your boy can wait.
I'm taking you to a hospital.

853
01:14:17,501 --> 01:14:18,667
No.

854
01:14:19,918 --> 01:14:21,501
I'm going to find my son.

855
01:14:23,626 --> 01:14:27,501
- Can you drive?
- I think I broke a rib,

856
01:14:27,542 --> 01:14:31,542
if you have any type of cloth,
a bandage, an old sheet.

857
01:15:34,334 --> 01:15:35,709
You have scissors?

858
01:16:18,125 --> 01:16:19,292
Thank you.

859
01:16:22,417 --> 01:16:25,876
When you find your boy,
take him home.

860
01:16:26,167 --> 01:16:28,751
Don't say anything,
just take him home.

861
01:17:15,834 --> 01:17:17,000
It was him...

862
01:17:17,334 --> 01:17:18,542
My boy, who drew this.

863
01:17:18,542 --> 01:17:20,250
- Your boy?
- Yeah.

864
01:17:21,042 --> 01:17:23,167
Pedro. My son.

865
01:17:23,209 --> 01:17:26,209
Some kid came here,
starving to death. Flat broke.

866
01:17:26,667 --> 01:17:28,334
So I made a deal with him.

867
01:17:29,667 --> 01:17:31,626
- Would you sell it to me?
- No.

868
01:17:33,792 --> 01:17:35,250
This is you here, right?

869
01:17:36,125 --> 01:17:37,167
Yeah.

870
01:17:37,334 --> 01:17:39,709
The kid is good, got talent.

871
01:17:39,792 --> 01:17:40,876
Yeah.

872
01:17:41,876 --> 01:17:43,083
Yeah.

873
01:17:47,918 --> 01:17:50,042
Hey, bro, who do you think I am?

874
01:17:56,459 --> 01:17:57,626
I'm real close.

875
01:17:57,626 --> 01:17:59,792
I think I'll catch him up
in half and hour now.

876
01:17:59,834 --> 01:18:02,667
And how is he?
Is he OK?

877
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:06,000
I just talked to this guy
and he said that he was great,

878
01:18:06,042 --> 01:18:10,250
I mean, hungry as hell,
and traded a plate of food...

879
01:18:10,292 --> 01:18:12,209
for one of his
drawings, Branca.

880
01:18:12,459 --> 01:18:14,876
The drawing is great.

881
01:18:14,876 --> 01:18:18,334
It's a guy surrounded by women,
you know...

882
01:18:18,417 --> 01:18:20,000
the type you see
in garages, these pinups.

883
01:18:21,334 --> 01:18:23,626
I offered to buy it, but he didn't
want to sell it.

884
01:18:23,626 --> 01:18:25,542
He really liked the drawing.

885
01:18:25,834 --> 01:18:27,584
I'm close. Close.

886
01:18:27,834 --> 01:18:30,125
- I'll catch him up soon.
- That's so good to hear, Theo.

887
01:18:30,667 --> 01:18:31,751
Branca...

888
01:18:34,501 --> 01:18:35,834
I love you.

889
01:18:42,167 --> 01:18:43,459
I love you.

890
01:18:53,626 --> 01:18:54,834
Kisses.

891
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,375
And this motorbike here?
Want a make a deal?

892
01:20:10,667 --> 01:20:12,000
What's wrong, buddy?

893
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,501
An accident.
Animal on the road.

894
01:21:25,667 --> 01:21:26,667
Pedro.

895
01:21:38,626 --> 01:21:41,959
BEACH

896
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,167
Hi, dad.

897
01:26:04,959 --> 01:26:06,167
Theo.

898
01:26:07,167 --> 01:26:08,501
Is that you?

899
01:26:15,501 --> 01:26:17,459
Someone gave you
a good beating, huh?

900
01:26:19,459 --> 01:26:20,792
A few.

901
01:26:25,584 --> 01:26:26,751
You see?

902
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:31,042
It's amazing, don't you think?

903
01:26:33,584 --> 01:26:37,375
He draws.
Your son draws.

904
01:26:40,834 --> 01:26:44,542
He's like me.
He's very good.

905
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,292
Yeah, I didn't know.

906
01:26:48,667 --> 01:26:51,250
I'm as deaf as a door.
I can't hear you.

907
01:26:51,375 --> 01:26:54,000
If you want to cuss me out,
it'll have to be face-to-face.

908
01:26:54,083 --> 01:26:55,083
Go on.

909
01:26:57,584 --> 01:26:59,876
I didn't know that Pedro
knew how to draw.

910
01:26:59,876 --> 01:27:01,209
I can't hear you,
I don't understand.

911
01:27:01,209 --> 01:27:02,334
Nothing, forget it.

912
01:27:14,250 --> 01:27:15,626
He draws.

913
01:27:17,918 --> 01:27:22,250
I wrote Pedro a letter...

914
01:27:23,584 --> 01:27:25,667
and sent him a drawing
of my face.

915
01:27:26,417 --> 01:27:28,792
Well, I never thought that
he'd answer.

916
01:27:35,918 --> 01:27:39,709
And he sent me
a drawing and a letter.

917
01:27:39,751 --> 01:27:41,542
I thought he was such a...

918
01:27:43,918 --> 01:27:45,167
so...

919
01:27:48,250 --> 01:27:49,584
So I...

920
01:27:50,792 --> 01:27:52,459
I started thinking...

921
01:27:53,167 --> 01:27:59,542
you have such a good kid
like that, such a great kid...

922
01:28:01,292 --> 01:28:03,501
I imagined
if you didn't think...

923
01:28:03,542 --> 01:28:05,501
of all the things I lost
with you...

924
01:28:07,375 --> 01:28:12,167
and let me be
the boy's grandfather.

925
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,375
He crossed two states
just to meet you.

926
01:28:23,375 --> 01:28:24,542
I don't understand.

927
01:28:24,542 --> 01:28:25,959
I can't hear you.

928
01:28:26,459 --> 01:28:31,250
Pedro rode through
two states on a horse...

929
01:28:31,918 --> 01:28:33,375
to meet you.

930
01:28:33,626 --> 01:28:36,501
On a horse? He came on horseback?
Are you sure? On a horse?

931
01:28:45,834 --> 01:28:48,083
He brought me a horse.

932
01:28:49,918 --> 01:28:51,250
He did.

933
01:32:13,125 --> 01:32:17,751
