1
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:40,207
In autumn 1952,
Stalin condemns the medical profession.

2
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,334
Accused of a Zionist plot,

3
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:46,380
the Kremlin's Jewish doctors
are the first arrested…

4
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:58,660
Come on out!

5
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:08,629
We're not here about
the Zionist plot, but to…

6
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,964
call on your skills

7
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,759
as a professor of medicine.

8
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:17,930
My uncle is very ill.
He has Cheynes-Stokes syndrome.

9
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:20,432
What's your prognosis?

10
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:25,646
If you're after your uncle's inheritance,

11
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,314
it's all sewn up.

12
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,568
Are you sure?

13
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:33,737
Positive.

14
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:36,823
Poor man.

15
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,254
Just as I thought.

16
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:52,923
You can get dressed.

17
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:57,386
Where did I get a disease like this?

18
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,807
I don't recall sleeping with my husband

19
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:03,725
since the war ended.

20
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:07,396
I don't know, but we'll cure it.

21
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,649
I'm in pain. Terrible pain.

22
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:13,110
I can imagine.

23
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,530
The pills will ease the pain.

24
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,907
I was told you could…

25
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,583
It won't help in your case.

26
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,043
And doing it wears me out.

27
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,589
Try these. Come back if they don't work.

28
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,967
Morning and evening
until they're all gone.

29
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,511
-The pains?
-No, the pills.

30
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:43,098
Don't stop if the pain goes
or it'll come back.

31
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:50,022
You're not Jewish
in your passport but your name is.

32
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:54,693
It's wiser nowadays,
but I need to know what's what.

33
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,195
Come in!

34
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:03,035
All right, Abramovich, we'll talk later.

35
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:06,121
Come over here. Sit down.

36
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:16,507
We haven't had a chat for a while now.

37
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:20,302
I'm sorry about that.
But there's so much to do.

38
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,179
You're well?

39
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:25,057
Very well, thank you.

40
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:26,683
Wonderful.

41
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,229
I wish I could say as much,
but I'm kept too busy.

42
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,733
I haven't had your patient figures
for last month.

43
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,904
Is everything all right?
No major problems?

44
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,073
I'd have come if so.

45
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,200
Very good.

46
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:50,916
Heard about the bother
at the Kremlin hospital?

47
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,001
Still, no concern of ours.

48
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,422
What does concern me, however…

49
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:02,427
is your unpopularity
with certain colleagues.

50
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:04,388
It's true…

51
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,557
I hear things.

52
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,809
They say you steal patients.

53
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,772
I don't believe that.

54
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:16,650
People say you're an individualist.

55
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,695
You set yourself apart from the others.

56
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,615
In my opinion…

57
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,784
you'll need a protector

58
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:28,287
in the coming weeks and months.

59
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:30,873
I have contacts, you know.

60
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,419
I'll let you decide.

61
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,766
We could meet here in the evening

62
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,977
or during the lunch hour.

63
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,522
Don't wait until the problems begin.

64
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,735
My friends like a little notice.
You understand?

65
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:04,239
You know we can't protect one another.

66
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:07,367
Yes. But we can denounce each other.

67
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,246
My desire for you is killing me!

68
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:14,750
We have so few pleasures,
I can't ignore it.

69
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:19,379
You understand, don't you?

70
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,801
Don't forget your figures.

71
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:46,990
Good evening.

72
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:50,077
You should come to my office

73
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:52,120
when you have a moment.

74
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,748
All right. What's it about?

75
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,501
How can I put it?

76
00:06:57,668 --> 00:06:59,169
It's hard to explain.

77
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,713
This isn't the right place. Come.

78
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,132
Don't wait too long.

79
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,420
Guess who.

80
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,134
I don't know.

81
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:30,719
Your mother?

82
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:32,054
Silly.

83
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,787
Did you have a good day?

84
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,874
Just an ordinary day.

85
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,166
And you?

86
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,960
A pretty good day.

87
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,129
Why?

88
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:51,008
I may be replacing Andreyev.
He drowned last night.

89
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,386
Drowned? How?

90
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:56,054
In his own vomit.

91
00:09:57,598 --> 00:10:01,768
People talk of cirrhosis,
but many alcoholics drown to death.

92
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,396
Won't replacing him be too much?

93
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:11,904
No, I'll only be assistant
to the deputy office chief.

94
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,531
Think I'll be a threat to anyone?

95
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:17,451
To the office chief. What's he like?

96
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,205
The same color as his office walls.

97
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:32,299
I need a word, Anna Alexandrovna.

98
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:34,593
Yes?

99
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:38,847
Well, it doesn't concern you,
Nikolai Vasilyevich.

100
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:42,184
You can speak in front of my husband.

101
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:49,066
Before, husband and wife
owed one another everything.

102
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:53,403
But nowadays we adhere
to other values. Am I wrong?

103
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,863
Am I wrong?

104
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,326
Some other time, then.

105
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:20,138
We'll manage it.

106
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:29,147
Come on.

107
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:30,858
Right now?

108
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,579
Does that work?

109
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:34,713
Has it been proved medically?

110
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,049
It can't do any harm.

111
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:43,639
I'm sure it's my fault.
We'll never manage it.

112
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,891
You shouldn't say that.

113
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:25,806
I was waiting.

114
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:29,142
This time, we can talk.

115
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:32,771
I'm in a hurry.
Can't it wait till this evening?

116
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:35,774
What could wait on Sunday can't wait now.

117
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,654
Your neighbors have complained.

118
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:41,947
About the music?

119
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:43,448
No.

120
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:47,286
They've told me that you disturb…

121
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,746
You, not your husband.

122
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:53,292
That's why I didn't want
to speak to him on Sunday.

123
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:57,421
Anyway, you disturb their peace with cries

124
00:13:57,588 --> 00:14:00,299
that they claim are cries of pleasure.

125
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:03,427
Once or twice an evening for a year,

126
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:07,431
and even three times on Sunday,
during the day.

127
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:09,099
Do you admit it?

128
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:11,476
Yes.

129
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:13,687
We're trying to have a baby.

130
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:15,939
I'm not contesting your motives,

131
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:18,025
but… How can I put it?

132
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:21,111
One serious question remains.

133
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:22,863
Yes? Which one?

134
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:27,284
The plaintiffs, and I have to agree,

135
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:31,371
wonder not only how a woman
can take so much pleasure,

136
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:34,333
but how she can inflict it on others.

137
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:39,254
You realize that if I report
the facts as they stand,

138
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:42,674
they'll be interpreted by the authorities.

139
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:44,218
We know the truth.

140
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,304
They may try their best,

141
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:50,849
but do they have the ability to judge?

142
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:53,769
So who will interpret the facts?

143
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:59,441
If the neighbors say
it's lasted a year now,

144
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:02,402
why didn't they complain sooner?

145
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,488
What are you implying?

146
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:08,367
Nothing at all. I have to go. I'm sorry.

147
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:09,701
Of course, you may go.

148
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:10,786
Thank you.

149
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:12,788
I'll think it over, then.

150
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:03,964
To see the director.

151
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:05,716
Got an appointment?

152
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:08,135
He told me to come anytime.

153
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:10,637
But he didn't say when.

154
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:13,098
No, he said anytime.

155
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:15,767
I'm not sure he's here.

156
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:19,229
Doctor Atlina. Come in, comrade, come in.

157
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:27,905
Have a seat, please.

158
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:32,534
You were right to come.

159
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:40,334
You inspire jealousy.

160
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:42,586
People flock to your consultation.

161
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:45,005
You know why.

162
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,303
I've been asked to report you,

163
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:56,725
and since I haven't,
others are threatening to do it.

164
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:00,521
I don't know what to do.

165
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:02,689
Apart from talk to you.

166
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:11,907
We have to say goodbye now.

167
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:15,577
I just wanted you to know,

168
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:18,914
if you are bothered
it won't be because of me.

169
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:27,130
I'll see you out.

170
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:33,762
Thank you.

171
00:18:05,294 --> 00:18:06,378
Here you go.

172
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:11,967
This is all they gave me.

173
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:15,012
Usually it's better.

174
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:18,765
I bet this sheep walked from Vladivostok

175
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:22,102
and we get the wolves' leftovers.

176
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,522
And we're privileged, remember.

177
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:34,740
Good thing we still have love.

178
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:39,203
I have my period.

179
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:52,257
We'll never manage it.

180
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:54,885
We will…

181
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:28,126
Uncle Anton is here.

182
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:31,672
I think I'll have to keep him.

183
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:32,756
How is he?

184
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:35,008
More and more off his rocker.

185
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,677
How are you, Uncle Anton?

186
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:38,929
Better wouldn't be proper.

187
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:41,431
Vasily, Anton wanted
to take a sauna with you.

188
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:44,852
From the ministry store.

189
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:48,397
Keep the meat.
Anton caught a carp for lunch.

190
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,942
I imagine you won't be able
to stay very late.

191
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:09,918
Know what that pig Zhdanov said
about Shostakovich before dying?

192
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:15,424
"The fellow is a counter-revolutionary,

193
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:19,052
since the people
cannot even hum his music."

194
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:22,556
Shostakovich…

195
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:33,483
My sister said you work like crazy.

196
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:35,360
Why?

197
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:39,656
You like physics that much?

198
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:45,495
If I don't work, I think.
And if I think, I die.

199
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:50,959
Don't cut too much off.

200
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:56,632
You know,

201
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:59,134
Stalin has his own logic,

202
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:01,887
and it's not within everyone's grasp.

203
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:05,599
It's served us well thus far.

204
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,310
Say what you like,

205
00:21:08,477 --> 00:21:12,439
but I was never bothered
during the pre-war purges.

206
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:14,441
Nor your poor late father.

207
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:16,777
All the same,

208
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:21,031
we had considerable responsibilities.

209
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,286
That shows he has his criteria.

210
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:08,161
Are you all right?

211
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,457
Yes, I'm fine.

212
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,130
If you're fine, you're hiding something.

213
00:22:18,881 --> 00:22:20,549
I prefer you to feel bad.

214
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:26,722
Yes, if you like, I feel bad.

215
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:30,350
That's better.

216
00:23:56,311 --> 00:23:58,146
My head's spinning…

217
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:01,817
But the pain has gone.

218
00:24:02,985 --> 00:24:04,236
It won't be back.

219
00:24:04,403 --> 00:24:07,155
-I don't need to see you again?
-No.

220
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:11,910
Doctor Atlina?

221
00:24:12,828 --> 00:24:13,871
Yes.

222
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:15,581
Follow us.

223
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:18,458
What do I tell my patients?

224
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:21,628
They'll see you go. Get your things.

225
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:04,588
We're not going to the Lubyanka?

226
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:06,715
Why?

227
00:25:10,344 --> 00:25:12,763
Did you hear someone say we were?

228
00:27:41,745 --> 00:27:44,998
Excuse me, where's the bathroom, please?

229
00:27:45,332 --> 00:27:47,543
You can go after you're searched.

230
00:27:49,503 --> 00:27:50,754
So what do I do?

231
00:28:17,823 --> 00:28:19,575
Stand up. It's your turn.

232
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:55,921
Atlina?

233
00:30:09,351 --> 00:30:11,645
Did I tell you not to sit down?

234
00:30:31,415 --> 00:30:33,959
You're trembling. Are you cold?

235
00:30:50,017 --> 00:30:51,977
Do you know why you're here?

236
00:30:54,229 --> 00:30:55,647
No, master.

237
00:31:00,277 --> 00:31:04,031
I'm no one's master. Just a comrade.

238
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,201
Comrade Stalin.

239
00:31:11,788 --> 00:31:13,707
I'm told you have a power.

240
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:17,085
A power that I don't possess.

241
00:31:18,337 --> 00:31:20,756
Not at all, Comrade Stalin.

242
00:31:21,965 --> 00:31:23,967
You're a urologist.

243
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:26,720
I have no urological problems.

244
00:31:28,013 --> 00:31:30,474
But I've heard of a power in your hands,

245
00:31:30,641 --> 00:31:34,478
a sort of magnetism
that eases pain, is that right?

246
00:31:34,645 --> 00:31:37,022
People exaggerate, Comrade Stalin.

247
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:40,817
Only witches have powers like that.

248
00:31:42,945 --> 00:31:45,739
We've swept aside such beliefs

249
00:31:45,906 --> 00:31:47,699
that blind the people.

250
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:51,078
Yet magnetism exists.

251
00:31:51,245 --> 00:31:54,289
Some have it in their eyes,
others in their hands.

252
00:31:58,377 --> 00:32:01,171
I just dismissed my personal physician.

253
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,759
He's suspected of being involved
in a Jewish doctors' plot.

254
00:32:07,302 --> 00:32:10,347
The thing is, I don't have a doctor now.

255
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:15,561
My enemies say, "The old man is sick.

256
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:20,023
He's not getting care.

257
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:24,528
He'll soon croak."

258
00:32:33,787 --> 00:32:36,874
So, do you have a gift?

259
00:32:39,376 --> 00:32:40,878
Just a tiny gift.

260
00:32:43,005 --> 00:32:45,174
My services tell me otherwise.

261
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:48,594
Do you work on the illness or the pain?

262
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:51,305
Both.

263
00:32:52,681 --> 00:32:56,101
If you can relieve me,
that'll be something.

264
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:01,148
My arteries cause me incredible pain.

265
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:08,822
Maybe you can help
more than those charlatans.

266
00:33:11,742 --> 00:33:13,911
My head hurts, my legs hurt…

267
00:33:15,037 --> 00:33:17,122
My left thigh is aching.

268
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:21,543
Show me if you can help me.

269
00:33:37,893 --> 00:33:39,269
Come closer.

270
00:33:41,188 --> 00:33:44,191
You're not laying your hands on Christ.

271
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:57,704
You're looking at me. What do you see?

272
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:03,919
I don't resemble my official portraits.

273
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:11,009
I never wanted to be an icon,
but the people need one.

274
00:34:15,973 --> 00:34:17,850
I'm tired.

275
00:34:28,861 --> 00:34:32,155
Go to the gramophone
and play the second piece.

276
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:35,325
After we finish, put it on again.

277
00:34:42,457 --> 00:34:44,877
The music soothes me.

278
00:35:00,601 --> 00:35:02,603
Do I need to undress?

279
00:35:02,936 --> 00:35:04,688
That won't be necessary.

280
00:35:06,231 --> 00:35:08,317
-Are you sure?
-Positive.

281
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:25,751
It burns!

282
00:35:28,378 --> 00:35:31,423
If there's any evil in this, you'll pay.

283
00:35:40,891 --> 00:35:42,392
Carry on.

284
00:37:54,608 --> 00:37:56,944
I must have dozed off.

285
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,403
What time is it?

286
00:37:59,321 --> 00:38:00,364
Ten o'clock.

287
00:38:00,531 --> 00:38:03,033
That late?

288
00:38:06,537 --> 00:38:08,997
I felt heat.

289
00:38:13,669 --> 00:38:17,047
Intense heat instead of the pain.

290
00:38:22,928 --> 00:38:24,763
You'll come back.

291
00:38:39,111 --> 00:38:43,949
I should point out that
no one must know about this.

292
00:38:46,326 --> 00:38:49,621
If word gets out,
in the interest of the people,

293
00:38:50,956 --> 00:38:54,585
I shall have to have you eliminated.

294
00:39:00,841 --> 00:39:02,593
You can count on me.

295
00:39:12,394 --> 00:39:16,899
You're married to a scientist
who works for a ministry.

296
00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:22,946
Do you trust him?

297
00:39:23,113 --> 00:39:25,115
Yes, very much.

298
00:39:27,201 --> 00:39:29,328
What trust can I place

299
00:39:29,494 --> 00:39:32,414
in someone devoted to somebody else?

300
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:37,920
Let's say he's arrested tomorrow.

301
00:39:38,086 --> 00:39:42,132
That he mentions our acquaintance
to avoid torture.

302
00:39:46,887 --> 00:39:49,723
Interrogation has the perverse effect

303
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:53,644
of making people talk
without being questioned.

304
00:40:00,067 --> 00:40:03,654
Do you think I imposed terror
with a light heart?

305
00:40:06,406 --> 00:40:10,702
Men must accept that at any time,
for no precise reason,

306
00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:15,165
they can be returned to that
absolute modesty known as death.

307
00:40:17,459 --> 00:40:20,212
Do you know why Hitler lost the war?

308
00:40:23,131 --> 00:40:25,926
He gave his men too many certainties.

309
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:35,477
If someone believes he is doing right,
one day he becomes lax…

310
00:40:38,564 --> 00:40:41,984
and thinks of biting the hand
that caressed him.

311
00:40:51,994 --> 00:40:54,288
Think hard about your husband.

312
00:40:54,454 --> 00:40:56,290
I'll tell him nothing.

313
00:40:58,834 --> 00:41:02,129
Analyze the situation more methodically.

314
00:41:02,296 --> 00:41:06,925
Our acquaintance could well
require you to leave him.

315
00:41:10,053 --> 00:41:11,722
That's just my advice.

316
00:41:12,264 --> 00:41:16,894
I'm sure your intelligence will
lead you to the same conclusion.

317
00:41:19,438 --> 00:41:21,523
I have to have breakfast now.

318
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:24,109
I'll send for you when I need you.

319
00:42:13,617 --> 00:42:14,952
We're here.

320
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:46,525
Arrested yesterday,

321
00:42:46,692 --> 00:42:49,069
absent this morning and here now.

322
00:42:49,236 --> 00:42:51,154
Care to explain?

323
00:42:51,321 --> 00:42:54,491
I was ill this morning, that's all.

324
00:42:54,658 --> 00:42:57,911
There's something I don't understand.

325
00:42:58,078 --> 00:43:01,999
No one is ever arrested
only to reappear the next day.

326
00:43:02,332 --> 00:43:05,002
If I was arrested, it was thanks to you,

327
00:43:05,169 --> 00:43:06,920
you and that muzhik.

328
00:43:07,087 --> 00:43:08,005
You're wrong.

329
00:43:08,172 --> 00:43:09,673
You're wrong!

330
00:43:10,799 --> 00:43:13,802
Until now, I've always protected you!

331
00:43:13,969 --> 00:43:17,931
True, as a professional,
I have to make reports,

332
00:43:18,098 --> 00:43:21,435
but I've never gone as far as I could.

333
00:43:21,935 --> 00:43:23,312
Nothing to say?

334
00:43:23,478 --> 00:43:25,939
All I can say to you, comrade,

335
00:43:26,106 --> 00:43:28,233
is that you have sex on the brain!

336
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,902
Your figures!

337
00:43:35,073 --> 00:43:36,992
You think you're so tough!

338
00:43:39,912 --> 00:43:41,580
So be it.

339
00:43:42,289 --> 00:43:45,209
I have to file a report on your absence.

340
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:47,753
I'll forget your insolence…

341
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,129
For now.

342
00:43:52,716 --> 00:43:54,760
You disappoint me, Atlina.

343
00:43:57,513 --> 00:43:59,932
But I can still turn a blind eye.

344
00:44:00,098 --> 00:44:02,184
You know my conditions.

345
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:55,654
Something wrong, Anna Alexandrovna?

346
00:44:57,531 --> 00:44:59,366
No, I…

347
00:44:59,825 --> 00:45:01,702
I was short of breath.

348
00:45:02,786 --> 00:45:04,705
The heating's on too high?

349
00:45:04,872 --> 00:45:06,957
Others have said so too.

350
00:45:07,124 --> 00:45:09,168
But we can't do a thing.

351
00:45:36,778 --> 00:45:38,906
I thought you'd been arrested.

352
00:45:53,962 --> 00:45:55,672
I slept somewhere else.

353
00:45:59,051 --> 00:46:00,552
Meaning?

354
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:04,431
I was at another man's place.

355
00:46:10,938 --> 00:46:12,439
What other man?

356
00:46:15,234 --> 00:46:16,693
A man.

357
00:46:18,362 --> 00:46:20,447
Whom you met how?

358
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:25,118
I'm treating him.

359
00:46:29,998 --> 00:46:33,126
We had the world's strongest marriage,

360
00:46:33,293 --> 00:46:36,171
but now you've slept with another man?

361
00:46:36,338 --> 00:46:40,008
Who is he? What does he do?
Where does he live? Why him?

362
00:46:41,677 --> 00:46:44,221
He's powerful in the Party.

363
00:46:47,057 --> 00:46:48,517
But why?

364
00:46:51,228 --> 00:46:53,105
Can he give you a child?

365
00:46:53,272 --> 00:46:55,983
Or can he protect you as a doctor?

366
00:46:56,149 --> 00:46:57,359
I don't know.

367
00:46:58,485 --> 00:47:00,863
It happened because it had to.

368
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,542
What will you do now?

369
00:47:16,587 --> 00:47:18,130
Leave you.

370
00:47:21,341 --> 00:47:22,801
Leave me?

371
00:47:29,057 --> 00:47:30,893
Why are you doing this?

372
00:47:33,353 --> 00:47:37,107
Why do I have to lose everything
all at once?

373
00:48:28,075 --> 00:48:29,993
Do you want to get divorced?

374
00:48:32,538 --> 00:48:33,497
Yes.

375
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:41,630
What can a powerful man do for you?

376
00:48:42,214 --> 00:48:45,384
Except drag you down
when he falls from power?

377
00:48:46,468 --> 00:48:48,470
You were safe with me.

378
00:48:51,598 --> 00:48:53,225
Do you want me…

379
00:48:54,142 --> 00:48:57,229
to leave now?
Do you want to think it over?

380
00:48:57,396 --> 00:48:58,647
No, I'll leave.

381
00:49:00,232 --> 00:49:03,110
I need to get organized.
It won't take long.

382
00:49:06,572 --> 00:49:09,074
If you regret it, I want you to know

383
00:49:09,241 --> 00:49:10,993
I'll be here, waiting.

384
00:49:14,329 --> 00:49:15,789
Because I love you.

385
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:20,085
I'm sorry, Vasily.

386
00:49:21,545 --> 00:49:23,714
For pity's sake, don't pity me.

387
00:49:58,790 --> 00:49:59,833
Come on!

388
00:50:11,762 --> 00:50:13,305
What's wrong?

389
00:50:13,931 --> 00:50:15,849
It burns all the time.

390
00:50:16,016 --> 00:50:17,684
All right. Lie down.

391
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,903
What do you drink?

392
00:50:28,862 --> 00:50:30,239
Water.

393
00:50:30,739 --> 00:50:32,574
Don't tell me lies!

394
00:50:33,325 --> 00:50:34,743
Vodka.

395
00:50:35,911 --> 00:50:37,371
What do you do?

396
00:50:38,121 --> 00:50:40,499
I make cologne for Party members.

397
00:50:42,417 --> 00:50:43,877
Do you drink it often?

398
00:50:44,711 --> 00:50:46,171
It happens.

399
00:50:47,464 --> 00:50:49,299
I was told you could help.

400
00:50:49,466 --> 00:50:50,676
Yes.

401
00:50:50,843 --> 00:50:53,053
Lie down. I'll try something.

402
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:02,813
You should give up the cologne.

403
00:51:05,816 --> 00:51:08,026
I can't help it.

404
00:52:25,062 --> 00:52:26,772
I was in the corridor

405
00:52:26,939 --> 00:52:29,816
an hour ago and you had no patients left.

406
00:52:29,983 --> 00:52:34,154
Now why would a lady doctor
stay so late after work

407
00:52:34,321 --> 00:52:37,366
if not to put off the moment to go home?

408
00:52:39,368 --> 00:52:42,204
Only natural if you share
a communal apartment,

409
00:52:42,371 --> 00:52:44,414
but that's not your case.

410
00:52:44,581 --> 00:52:47,584
-You were waiting for me.
-Touch me and I'll scream!

411
00:52:52,214 --> 00:52:54,258
Choose carefully, then!

412
00:52:54,424 --> 00:52:57,469
A scream you threaten me with,
one I can give you,

413
00:52:57,636 --> 00:53:01,557
or the scream they'll extract
from you when the time comes!

414
00:56:34,436 --> 00:56:36,355
Roy, Roy. Hello, beauty.

415
00:56:37,606 --> 00:56:40,067
Sorry I wrecked your store.

416
00:56:41,401 --> 00:56:42,486
Forget it.

417
00:56:43,362 --> 00:56:47,407
You didn't want any brawls
unless they were over you.

418
00:56:48,825 --> 00:56:50,118
Remember?

419
00:56:59,211 --> 00:57:02,214
Undress completely.
Just keep your panties on.

420
00:57:46,633 --> 00:57:47,968
What's this?

421
00:57:48,135 --> 00:57:49,386
A capsule.

422
00:57:49,553 --> 00:57:50,846
What for?

423
00:57:51,013 --> 00:57:55,058
It's a repellent to keep insects
out of a woman's fur.

424
00:57:55,392 --> 00:57:58,687
Like the stuff in cupboards
to keep moths away.

425
00:57:59,062 --> 00:58:00,147
It's safe.

426
00:58:00,314 --> 00:58:03,442
Security will have to analyze it
all the same.

427
00:58:07,112 --> 00:58:09,948
-Who made it?
-I did. I'm a doctor.

428
00:58:10,115 --> 00:58:11,992
It's an experimental product

429
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:13,994
that I'm testing on myself.

430
00:58:14,912 --> 00:58:17,206
It could be good for the people.

431
00:58:17,372 --> 00:58:19,124
But if I lose it here,

432
00:58:19,291 --> 00:58:21,960
months of work will go to waste.

433
00:58:22,127 --> 00:58:23,045
That's how it is.

434
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:26,423
If you want it back, file a request.

435
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:27,799
Get dressed.

436
00:58:38,852 --> 00:58:40,437
There, it's over.

437
00:59:18,225 --> 00:59:19,351
Poskrebyshev!

438
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:35,492
You relieved me the other night.
You're gifted.

439
00:59:36,535 --> 00:59:39,496
But pain is like a battered wife.

440
00:59:40,581 --> 00:59:43,333
Reason does not prevent their return.

441
00:59:47,796 --> 00:59:50,507
We overdid it tonight. A five-hour dinner.

442
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:54,761
To reach the conclusion
that I am surrounded

443
00:59:55,095 --> 00:59:58,140
by children and blind kittens.

444
00:59:58,307 --> 00:59:59,808
And alcoholics.

445
01:00:05,522 --> 01:00:08,025
Sit down. I won't say it every time.

446
01:00:16,241 --> 01:00:18,785
The Americans know how to make movies.

447
01:00:20,329 --> 01:00:22,748
The translation's the problem. Bolshakov!

448
01:00:25,042 --> 01:00:29,129
He recites the translation
but is always a few seconds late.

449
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:32,966
One is tempted to get rid of such fellows.

450
01:00:36,386 --> 01:00:38,055
I never tire

451
01:00:38,222 --> 01:00:40,974
of a scene in Chaplin's
The Great Dictator,

452
01:00:41,808 --> 01:00:44,520
which we saw first tonight.

453
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:49,566
One Jew says to another,

454
01:00:53,737 --> 01:00:57,616
"You're so used to misfortune,
when there isn't any

455
01:00:58,075 --> 01:01:00,369
it seems to make you unhappy."

456
01:01:10,003 --> 01:01:11,755
Where was I?

457
01:01:11,922 --> 01:01:13,215
Yes…

458
01:01:14,716 --> 01:01:16,343
The Americans.

459
01:01:17,344 --> 01:01:19,471
I was fond of Roosevelt.

460
01:01:22,015 --> 01:01:26,103
A well-read man
with a great deal of subtlety.

461
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:30,941
Nothing like his successor…

462
01:01:33,986 --> 01:01:37,030
That shirt salesman, Truman.

463
01:01:37,197 --> 01:01:40,284
So proud to tell me he had the atom bomb.

464
01:01:42,536 --> 01:01:45,163
He dropped it on Japan to scare me.

465
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:47,291
That's the only reason.

466
01:01:47,875 --> 01:01:49,626
Just to scare me!

467
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:02,181
Aren't you scared?

468
01:02:02,347 --> 01:02:04,099
Scared of what?

469
01:02:05,767 --> 01:02:07,895
Of the way I confide in you.

470
01:02:08,061 --> 01:02:09,813
Aren't you thinking,

471
01:02:11,231 --> 01:02:13,483
"What if he regrets it tomorrow?"

472
01:02:18,238 --> 01:02:22,159
-Am I wrong?
-You're wrong, Comrade Stalin.

473
01:02:26,413 --> 01:02:29,708
Even if I am wrong,
did you heed my advice?

474
01:02:30,834 --> 01:02:33,754
Have you kept our meetings to yourself?

475
01:02:33,921 --> 01:02:36,215
I haven't told anyone about them.

476
01:02:41,136 --> 01:02:44,389
How did you explain your absence
to your husband?

477
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:47,476
I told him I had a lover.

478
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:49,853
And that I was leaving him.

479
01:02:51,772 --> 01:02:55,692
Divorce is no use
unless you part physically.

480
01:02:56,443 --> 01:02:58,362
How will you go about it?

481
01:03:00,656 --> 01:03:02,115
I don't know, I…

482
01:03:02,991 --> 01:03:05,786
I haven't managed to find a solution yet.

483
01:03:08,372 --> 01:03:11,375
I have no power
to allocate you an apartment.

484
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:15,754
I'm just Stalin.

485
01:03:18,257 --> 01:03:20,050
Work something out.

486
01:03:20,884 --> 01:03:23,554
Tell me and I'll see what I can do.

487
01:03:27,057 --> 01:03:29,434
Take care of my legs now.

488
01:03:29,601 --> 01:03:32,020
I'm in a lot of pain.

489
01:03:32,187 --> 01:03:33,730
Terrible pain.

490
01:04:46,637 --> 01:04:51,016
The revolution cannot defeat
women's interest in their looks.

491
01:04:53,644 --> 01:04:57,523
As soon as they rise,
they turn to their mirrors.

492
01:05:06,865 --> 01:05:09,201
I feel better this morning.

493
01:05:12,454 --> 01:05:15,707
Have you noticed? No one comes to wake me.

494
01:05:16,416 --> 01:05:20,003
Circumstances could require it
at times, but no.

495
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:25,175
No one ever takes that responsibility.

496
01:05:26,385 --> 01:05:30,055
Events are requested to wait,
whatever happens.

497
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:45,362
When the Germans entered the Soviet Union,

498
01:05:45,863 --> 01:05:49,533
I didn't find out until three hours later,

499
01:05:51,618 --> 01:05:53,912
when I woke up.

500
01:05:55,289 --> 01:05:58,417
Can you tell me what difference it made?

501
01:06:01,044 --> 01:06:03,797
None, none at all.

502
01:06:06,341 --> 01:06:10,012
It didn't take three hours
longer to throw them out.

503
01:06:20,022 --> 01:06:23,859
I may be able to solve
your accommodation problem.

504
01:07:37,724 --> 01:07:39,017
Remember?

505
01:07:47,192 --> 01:07:48,777
Something wrong?

506
01:07:58,912 --> 01:08:01,206
I presume I can't do anything.

507
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:04,102
You were expecting us, comrade?

508
01:09:05,395 --> 01:09:07,105
Our orders aren't for you.

509
01:09:07,272 --> 01:09:10,567
We've come to fetch Vasily Nikolayevich.

510
01:09:10,734 --> 01:09:11,985
What?

511
01:09:12,819 --> 01:09:14,947
You must be mistaken.

512
01:09:15,113 --> 01:09:16,740
You're here for me.

513
01:09:16,907 --> 01:09:18,951
Anna Alexandrovna.

514
01:09:19,117 --> 01:09:20,452
He has two minutes.

515
01:09:20,619 --> 01:09:22,204
They're here for me?

516
01:09:23,830 --> 01:09:24,831
It's better.

517
01:09:25,916 --> 01:09:27,751
Believe me, you're mistaken.

518
01:09:27,918 --> 01:09:30,212
Could you check, please?

519
01:09:30,379 --> 01:09:32,506
Anna Alexandrovna.

520
01:09:32,673 --> 01:09:34,007
Excuse me.

521
01:09:37,302 --> 01:09:38,929
I'll soon join my parents.

522
01:09:39,096 --> 01:09:41,807
I just hope it won't take too long.

523
01:10:18,468 --> 01:10:20,804
Please, don't get up.

524
01:10:21,889 --> 01:10:23,390
I preferred to come here.

525
01:10:23,557 --> 01:10:26,768
My office would have made it too official.

526
01:10:27,853 --> 01:10:29,313
You seem very upset.

527
01:10:29,813 --> 01:10:32,065
Has something bad happened?

528
01:10:33,692 --> 01:10:34,568
No.

529
01:10:37,321 --> 01:10:38,864
This is a file on you

530
01:10:39,031 --> 01:10:42,117
drawn up by some ill-intentioned comrades.

531
01:10:43,202 --> 01:10:44,494
Your absences,

532
01:10:44,661 --> 01:10:47,706
your puzzling presence at the hospital…

533
01:10:47,873 --> 01:10:50,209
They say your medical practices

534
01:10:50,375 --> 01:10:53,962
pander to the people's
propensity for the irrational.

535
01:10:55,631 --> 01:10:59,009
I refused to pass it on
to the authorities.

536
01:11:02,137 --> 01:11:03,555
Why?

537
01:11:08,101 --> 01:11:10,938
Because I love you. That's all.

538
01:11:17,319 --> 01:11:18,904
I came to see you

539
01:11:19,071 --> 01:11:22,908
because I fear our paths
may part for good.

540
01:11:23,617 --> 01:11:27,246
I sincerely hope you will come to no harm.

541
01:11:27,412 --> 01:11:29,331
I have to go.

542
01:11:29,915 --> 01:11:32,501
Forgive me if I've saddened you.

543
01:14:13,370 --> 01:14:15,247
You're here at last.

544
01:14:18,876 --> 01:14:21,295
I'm in agony today.

545
01:14:26,842 --> 01:14:29,469
I'm suffering and you act shy.

546
01:14:31,263 --> 01:14:32,848
My legs…

547
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:36,935
My legs…

548
01:15:02,377 --> 01:15:05,672
You expend your youth to give me a little.

549
01:15:09,468 --> 01:15:12,429
Such sacrifice deserves a reward.

550
01:15:12,596 --> 01:15:14,264
Do you have any ideas?

551
01:15:16,141 --> 01:15:18,185
I want nothing for myself.

552
01:15:18,352 --> 01:15:20,103
But my husband has been arrested.

553
01:15:20,979 --> 01:15:23,607
I know. Your mother and uncle too.

554
01:15:26,985 --> 01:15:28,862
I solved your problem.

555
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:33,867
I couldn't have you moved
to a new apartment.

556
01:15:34,034 --> 01:15:37,120
I'd have been accused
of granting privileges.

557
01:15:38,622 --> 01:15:41,959
So the state took charge of your husband.

558
01:15:42,125 --> 01:15:44,503
He's being housed at the Lubyanka.

559
01:15:48,882 --> 01:15:50,259
In less than a week,

560
01:15:51,385 --> 01:15:53,679
I'm going to Georgia,

561
01:15:53,846 --> 01:15:57,224
to my dacha, Cold Stream.

562
01:15:57,391 --> 01:15:59,601
I'm taking you.

563
01:15:59,768 --> 01:16:01,770
You and my mineral water.

564
01:16:09,027 --> 01:16:12,739
There were two other things
to see to. I forget which.

565
01:16:14,032 --> 01:16:15,158
Ah, yes…

566
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:20,789
I learned your husband is Jewish.

567
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:25,627
-Did you know he was Jewish?
-No.

568
01:16:27,254 --> 01:16:30,090
You couldn't. He doesn't know himself.

569
01:16:32,134 --> 01:16:35,429
His parents changed nationality
at the Revolution.

570
01:16:35,596 --> 01:16:37,431
To show their enthusiasm.

571
01:16:37,931 --> 01:16:40,475
Not enough, though. Since then,

572
01:16:40,642 --> 01:16:42,644
they've been executed.

573
01:16:42,978 --> 01:16:46,190
The other thing… Yes.

574
01:16:47,482 --> 01:16:49,735
I remember now.

575
01:16:52,279 --> 01:16:54,698
I was told that…

576
01:16:56,533 --> 01:16:59,161
during your second search…

577
01:17:00,579 --> 01:17:04,208
you were found with a capsule on you.

578
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:12,090
Cyanide.

579
01:17:13,342 --> 01:17:15,219
An ill-intentioned person

580
01:17:16,053 --> 01:17:19,848
might think you were planning
to poison me.

581
01:17:22,851 --> 01:17:24,770
Yet you didn't.

582
01:17:28,982 --> 01:17:30,609
So why?

583
01:17:32,861 --> 01:17:34,863
Why the capsule?

584
01:17:36,281 --> 01:17:39,034
When you see so many people arrested…

585
01:17:40,494 --> 01:17:42,287
and sometimes executed…

586
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:44,748
according to a logic…

587
01:17:45,958 --> 01:17:47,751
that you alone know,

588
01:17:48,627 --> 01:17:50,712
because no one in this country

589
01:17:50,879 --> 01:17:53,090
is capable of understanding it,

590
01:17:55,717 --> 01:17:57,886
you prepare to die,

591
01:17:58,804 --> 01:18:00,764
as painlessly as possible.

592
01:18:03,851 --> 01:18:05,352
Very well…

593
01:18:08,897 --> 01:18:11,733
That's enough for this evening.

594
01:18:13,443 --> 01:18:14,862
Do you know

595
01:18:16,822 --> 01:18:18,991
you've become indispensable to me?

596
01:18:19,157 --> 01:18:22,035
I'm not indispensable, Comrade Stalin.

597
01:18:23,370 --> 01:18:27,040
I used to eliminate
anyone indispensable to me.

598
01:18:27,207 --> 01:18:30,919
Those people have since proved
that they weren't.

599
01:18:33,005 --> 01:18:34,506
But you're different.

600
01:21:27,471 --> 01:21:30,516
I'm seeing you in daylight
for the first time.

601
01:21:31,642 --> 01:21:34,895
I discover a pretty woman
with beautiful hair.

602
01:21:36,438 --> 01:21:39,441
A beautiful Russian
that we can be proud of.

603
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,158
Nature is beautiful.

604
01:21:51,328 --> 01:21:54,081
A pity it's so contradictory.

605
01:21:56,166 --> 01:21:58,585
That's why we've brought it to heel.

606
01:22:01,630 --> 01:22:03,882
I have news of your husband.

607
01:22:06,134 --> 01:22:08,053
I'll read it to you later.

608
01:22:10,097 --> 01:22:14,268
This evening, I'm having dinner
with my old Georgian friends.

609
01:22:15,686 --> 01:22:17,896
Come tonight at around three.

610
01:22:18,981 --> 01:22:20,566
Bring your hands.

611
01:22:22,025 --> 01:22:24,194
I'll come with my pain.

612
01:22:42,963 --> 01:22:45,215
I promised you this.

613
01:22:48,677 --> 01:22:50,637
News of your husband.

614
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:55,350
Where his health is concerned,

615
01:22:56,393 --> 01:22:58,478
the news is good.

616
01:23:00,689 --> 01:23:02,357
As for the rest…

617
01:23:10,073 --> 01:23:12,409
He was tortured for a long time.

618
01:23:15,662 --> 01:23:17,998
I never gave such instructions.

619
01:23:22,085 --> 01:23:24,755
Apparently, he has got over it.

620
01:23:28,342 --> 01:23:30,886
Your husband has a sense of humor.

621
01:23:31,053 --> 01:23:35,599
"I had nothing to give you
and yet you took everything."

622
01:23:39,603 --> 01:23:44,066
Your husband has only one testicle.

623
01:23:44,233 --> 01:23:45,734
Did you know that?

624
01:23:47,236 --> 01:23:49,238
They offered to spare it,

625
01:23:49,404 --> 01:23:51,907
"If you tell us what we want to hear."

626
01:23:52,074 --> 01:23:54,493
"What do you want to hear?"

627
01:23:55,869 --> 01:23:58,914
Yes, they can't know that.

628
01:23:59,081 --> 01:24:00,749
The right question is,

629
01:24:00,916 --> 01:24:03,794
"Who does your wife see in the evening?"

630
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:07,422
They don't know and neither does he.

631
01:24:10,384 --> 01:24:12,511
"We'll leave you that ball,

632
01:24:12,678 --> 01:24:16,682
but we'll make such a mess of your mind,

633
01:24:17,933 --> 01:24:22,396
you'll never be able
to give it orders again."

634
01:24:29,278 --> 01:24:32,322
He still hasn't said you have a lover.

635
01:24:35,284 --> 01:24:39,580
If the torturers are earnest,
they must carry on a little.

636
01:24:40,163 --> 01:24:41,915
I beseech you.

637
01:24:43,333 --> 01:24:45,002
Never implore me.

638
01:25:21,872 --> 01:25:24,666
You should eat more.

639
01:25:25,876 --> 01:25:27,753
You'll wither away.

640
01:25:36,762 --> 01:25:38,764
You miss your family.

641
01:25:39,515 --> 01:25:40,682
Is that it?

642
01:25:42,017 --> 01:25:44,436
But we'll go back to Moscow soon.

643
01:25:46,146 --> 01:25:47,439
Do you have children?

644
01:25:48,607 --> 01:25:49,942
No.

645
01:25:50,108 --> 01:25:52,945
Not yet. Do you?

646
01:25:54,029 --> 01:25:56,990
I'm already a grandfather.

647
01:25:57,157 --> 01:25:59,326
The latest was just born.

648
01:26:01,954 --> 01:26:03,705
What's his name?

649
01:26:03,872 --> 01:26:07,960
Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin.

650
01:26:08,794 --> 01:26:10,337
Putin.

651
01:26:12,506 --> 01:26:13,632
Goodbye.

652
01:26:33,694 --> 01:26:35,779
Your husband talked after an ordeal

653
01:26:35,946 --> 01:26:39,116
that not even a dead man
could have resisted.

654
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:45,873
He said he knew you were
seeing someone in power.

655
01:26:46,039 --> 01:26:48,292
He didn't give a name.

656
01:26:49,042 --> 01:26:51,503
Of course, he doesn't know it.

657
01:26:59,469 --> 01:27:02,014
We go back to Moscow tomorrow.

658
01:27:02,681 --> 01:27:05,767
I've looked at your husband's file.

659
01:27:05,934 --> 01:27:09,688
It would be a waste
to get rid of a good physicist,

660
01:27:11,148 --> 01:27:12,566
even a Jewish one.

661
01:27:15,027 --> 01:27:18,155
Our top scientists are building
a nuclear submarine.

662
01:27:18,322 --> 01:27:20,407
Your husband will join them.

663
01:27:21,575 --> 01:27:23,785
He will be housed on site.

664
01:27:25,871 --> 01:27:28,123
That way, you'll be rid of him.

665
01:27:28,957 --> 01:27:32,669
The difference between Hitler and me

666
01:27:33,003 --> 01:27:35,380
is that his racism blinded him

667
01:27:35,547 --> 01:27:38,175
until he lost sight of his interests.

668
01:27:40,219 --> 01:27:42,471
What about my mother and uncle?

669
01:27:44,264 --> 01:27:45,974
Can't you do something?

670
01:27:50,062 --> 01:27:51,146
Does your husband drink?

671
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:54,566
No.

672
01:27:58,695 --> 01:28:00,155
No.

673
01:28:00,322 --> 01:28:02,115
He's never drunk much.

674
01:28:03,575 --> 01:28:07,412
People working on projects
exposed to radiation

675
01:28:07,579 --> 01:28:10,666
have one defense
against the rays: alcohol.

676
01:28:10,832 --> 01:28:13,752
But we cannot have submarines being built

677
01:28:13,919 --> 01:28:17,172
by men who drink vodka around the clock.

678
01:28:18,757 --> 01:28:22,970
But if we forbid them to drink,
they're bound to end up dead.

679
01:28:23,136 --> 01:28:27,099
That's only a problem
if they die before completion.

680
01:28:33,897 --> 01:28:36,191
That's politics, you see.

681
01:28:36,358 --> 01:28:38,610
Endless decision-making.

682
01:28:42,197 --> 01:28:45,117
And there's no one who can do it for me.

683
01:28:52,124 --> 01:28:54,251
I'll miss this place.

684
01:28:57,337 --> 01:28:59,423
Something tells me

685
01:29:00,674 --> 01:29:03,010
I'll never see it again.

686
01:29:09,766 --> 01:29:13,854
And something tells me
that you will outlive me.

687
01:29:17,149 --> 01:29:19,026
Would you have bet on it?

688
01:31:05,799 --> 01:31:06,925
Enough!

689
01:31:07,092 --> 01:31:09,303
Enough, it doesn't help anymore.

690
01:31:10,095 --> 01:31:12,431
I'm in agony today.

691
01:31:12,598 --> 01:31:14,933
My head's going to explode.

692
01:31:18,103 --> 01:31:21,690
The people are scared,
but what do they know of my fears?

693
01:31:22,941 --> 01:31:25,110
What do they know of my fears?

694
01:31:27,404 --> 01:31:29,656
Music… Put some music on.

695
01:31:29,823 --> 01:31:32,451
Bring me the water from the desk.

696
01:32:29,424 --> 01:32:31,134
"I have been informed

697
01:32:31,301 --> 01:32:34,096
that Anna Alexandrovna Atlina,

698
01:32:34,263 --> 01:32:36,640
a hospital urologist,

699
01:32:36,807 --> 01:32:38,976
works for foreign powers.

700
01:32:39,685 --> 01:32:43,772
Questioning her or deporting her
could have its drawbacks.

701
01:32:44,314 --> 01:32:46,275
Have her eliminated."

702
01:36:53,897 --> 01:36:55,816
You're back, Vasily Nikolayevich.

703
01:36:55,983 --> 01:36:57,693
You look…

704
01:36:57,860 --> 01:37:01,488
I was going to say well.
No, you have some color.

705
01:37:04,449 --> 01:37:06,660
We're all orphans now.

706
01:37:06,827 --> 01:37:08,745
So sad, isn't it?

707
01:37:12,666 --> 01:37:17,045
Did you hear?
The Jewish census has been suspended.

708
01:37:17,212 --> 01:37:19,798
I don't know why I'm telling you.

709
01:37:19,965 --> 01:37:22,050
It didn't concern you.

710
01:37:24,178 --> 01:37:27,806
The Abramoviches were
the only Jews in this building.

711
01:37:28,849 --> 01:37:31,602
You don't know the Abramoviches?

712
01:37:31,768 --> 01:37:35,105
Very orderly people. It just goes to show.

713
01:38:02,299 --> 01:38:03,550
Vasily.

714
01:38:05,511 --> 01:38:06,887
Oh, my love…

715
01:38:08,388 --> 01:38:09,848
My love…

716
01:38:10,015 --> 01:38:12,267
I didn't think you'd be here.

717
01:38:17,773 --> 01:38:19,024
Have you left him?

718
01:38:21,902 --> 01:38:23,362
Left him…

719
01:38:24,863 --> 01:38:28,075
or maybe he's been deported,
maybe he's dead.

720
01:38:29,493 --> 01:38:31,537
No, I'll explain.

721
01:38:31,703 --> 01:38:33,121
Of course.

722
01:38:34,039 --> 01:38:37,417
There are things we can explain
over and over

723
01:38:37,584 --> 01:38:39,837
and that we'll never understand.

724
01:38:43,882 --> 01:38:46,260
I just hope he didn't hurt you.

725
01:38:56,353 --> 01:38:57,980
I'm tired.

726
01:39:03,610 --> 01:39:07,114
I've never loved another man but you.

727
01:39:10,242 --> 01:39:11,910
There has never been

728
01:39:12,077 --> 01:39:14,621
another man but you in my life.

729
01:39:15,914 --> 01:39:17,291
Never.

730
01:39:21,128 --> 01:39:22,588
Never.

731
01:39:38,228 --> 01:39:40,230
So it was a dream.

732
01:39:43,692 --> 01:39:45,944
We lived out a sort…

733
01:39:46,904 --> 01:39:48,197
of dream.

734
01:39:52,743 --> 01:39:54,286
I knew it.

735
01:40:02,586 --> 01:40:04,087
I knew it.

736
01:41:02,104 --> 01:41:08,318
Vasily died when his son
was two, on May 15, 1957.

737
01:41:10,863 --> 01:41:12,948
A man's death is a tragedy.

738
01:41:13,115 --> 01:41:16,869
The death of millions of men
is a statistic.

739
01:41:17,035 --> 01:41:19,454
Joseph Stalin
