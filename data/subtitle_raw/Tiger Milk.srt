1
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:18,667
Sometimes the music can't be too loud,
to drown out life.

2
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,208
Jameelah and I
have been best friends forever.

3
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,250
Inseparable and invincible.

4
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:16,333
We thought it'd always be that way.

5
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:38,542
We didn't want to grow up,
at least not entirely.

6
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:45,125
Just enough to get into clubs and not
have men think we were jailbait.

7
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,917
Noura says we're growing girls.

8
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,583
We need calcium, which is in milk.

9
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,375
But milk is for kids.

10
00:02:56,667 --> 00:02:59,042
Jameelah and I drink Tiger Milk.

11
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,500
TIGER MILK

12
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:08,875
You mix
lots of passion fruit juice, school milk

13
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,000
and a good dose of brandy.

14
00:03:17,417 --> 00:03:19,417
Imagine it, just imagine it...

15
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,458
I love Jameelah's stories.

16
00:03:22,542 --> 00:03:26,042
The subway is my flying carpet.
And Jameelah says...

17
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:29,292
So say at about 17
your breasts stop growing.

18
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:32,750
Imagine they filled up
with tiger milk once a month.

19
00:03:33,042 --> 00:03:37,125
-That'd drive the guys crazy.
-Stop it, Jameelah. You're nuts.

20
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:40,708
Celebrating ovulation with some sex god.

21
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:44,333
Tiger milk days once a month,
like your period.

22
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:47,792
-Tiger milk days?
-Tiger milk days and nights.

23
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,625
Nays and dights.

24
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:52,875
Jameelah loves mixing words.

25
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:54,458
-Dish.
-Wish.

26
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,875
-Wish soap.
-Shift.

27
00:03:56,167 --> 00:03:57,458
-Shit.
-Shit worker.

28
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,667
Night shit.

29
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:00,083
-Awesome.
-Oh-some.

30
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:01,667
-Coin.
-Con.

31
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,333
Deadeye.

32
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:04,875
Red-eye.

33
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,417
Cockeye.

34
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,833
-Bug-eye.
-Hey!

35
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:14,208
-Could we join in your conversation?
-Can you mix words?

36
00:04:14,917 --> 00:04:16,708
Can you speak the O-language?

37
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,417
-Awesome is oh-some, coin is...
-Con.

38
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,958
And you don't take a hit you toke a hot.

39
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,083
And teenagers are actually teenogres.

40
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:30,042
Yes, Amir, about your English grade.
It could be better.

41
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,917
Yes, it could be better.

42
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:35,083
How is it...

43
00:04:36,417 --> 00:04:38,167
that our A student

44
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:41,667
has an Iraqi passport
and the best German grade?

45
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,333
Great, Jameelah.

46
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:47,833
I'm seriously smart, Ms. Struck.
You'll have to naturalize me.

47
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:51,125
So do you already have plans for vacation?

48
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:53,292
Screwing Ms. Struck.

49
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,458
-Ms. Struck, this is so unfair!
-What?

50
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,958
-Fs in math and biology!
-Nini.

51
00:05:08,292 --> 00:05:11,417
I told you,
but you didn't want to do anything.

52
00:05:12,542 --> 00:05:16,750
But you'll move on to the next grade.
On probation, last chance.

53
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,792
ENJOY YOUR BREAK

54
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,458
As always, your report cards
have to be signed by your parents.

55
00:05:31,917 --> 00:05:34,125
Enjoy your break. See you in the fall.

56
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,375
Noura!

57
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,500
Habibti.

58
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,583
Mom, what's wrong?

59
00:05:56,917 --> 00:06:00,250
I'm worried.
A letter from the immigration office.

60
00:06:00,542 --> 00:06:03,292
-You always get those.
-It's a different color.

61
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,708
-Like a "pink slip"?
-That's not funny.

62
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:11,583
But we submitted
our naturalization application months ago.

63
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:17,958
You submitted it, right? Or didn't you?
Maybe we've missed the deadline. Crap!

64
00:06:18,542 --> 00:06:24,208
-Don't get worked up. I did submit it.
-Don't get worked up? If they deport us...

65
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,000
Calm down. Here.

66
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:29,958
This letter has to go in the mail today.
Check for mistakes.

67
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,875
-You sleeping over tonight?
-Yeah.

68
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:38,708
Good. I'll make us some nice food.
I have to get to work.

69
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,417
Here.

70
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,458
-Till later, girls.
-Send it!

71
00:06:43,792 --> 00:06:45,208
Yes!

72
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,167
Hey.

73
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:54,292
Hey? What do you mean, hey?
Hey, yo mama.

74
00:07:51,917 --> 00:07:52,833
Okay.

75
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:56,750
"Kathi, I've been watching you.
You're the sweetest..."

76
00:07:57,042 --> 00:07:58,542
Salam, sisters!

77
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:01,250
Are you nuts?

78
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:51,125
Jameelah says we have to know
how it all works.

79
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:53,250
We have to practice for later.

80
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:55,250
For real life.

81
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,708
So no one can mess with us.

82
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:05,625
Well?

83
00:09:06,042 --> 00:09:10,042
-Ethics class was cancelled today.
-Uh-huh. And now?

84
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:14,500
I'm Stella Stardust.
This is my friend Sophia Saturna.

85
00:09:14,792 --> 00:09:16,875
We sure are hot in these clothes.

86
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:20,333
-And we're thirsty.
-Can I help you in any way?

87
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:23,042
Costs 100 euros. Payment in advance.

88
00:09:25,917 --> 00:09:28,583
For this I'll fuck you both, at once.

89
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:31,750
Actually, I never do this,
but you're too hot.

90
00:09:32,042 --> 00:09:34,292
Actually, we never do this either.

91
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:36,000
You loser!

92
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,292
You sluts!

93
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,917
"I'll fuck you both at once," yo mama!

94
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:10,292
If I got caught at that
I'd never get citizenship.

95
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:17,083
Swear.

96
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:18,833
Pinkie promise.

97
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:23,750
Swear we'll stay together
and you'll never leave me alone.

98
00:10:24,042 --> 00:10:28,292
Hand on heart and on the lips.
Break the oath, bye-bye fingertips!

99
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,583
I won't go back to a country
where they build houses out of camel shit.

100
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:37,583
Hey, feet down!

101
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,792
We're getting off anyway, you Nazi!

102
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:45,833
Magic words are always cool.
Germany has a few magic words.

103
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,083
When you say them the world stops.

104
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,167
-Nazi! Jew!
-Did you hear that?

105
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:54,167
You can't say them loudly,
although they're normal words.

106
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,208
-Vagina.
-What?

107
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,458
-Vagina! Vagina!
-Nazi!

108
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,375
Watch your tongues!
There are small children here.

109
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:04,167
-Vagina! Vagina!
-Are you nuts?

110
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,375
Jew! Vagina! Nazi!

111
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,458
Jew! Vagina! Nazi!

112
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,167
-Pussy!
-Masturbation!

113
00:11:20,792 --> 00:11:24,583
Look at the pieces of wool.
We hung them in trees as kids.

114
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:28,167
Vacation. Endless summer.

115
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,708
Endless summer, yo mama.

116
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,375
I have to go to the children's hospital
to have my wisdom teeth pulled.

117
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:41,375
-Why during break and not during school?
-Really? The children's hospital?

118
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:44,083
You get ice cream and candy there.

119
00:11:45,542 --> 00:11:49,833
-Yeah, almost like a vacation.
-And what'll we do the rest of break?

120
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,625
-Definitely not screw Ms. Struck.
-No.

121
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:56,125
-We'll get deflowered.
-What?

122
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,208
-Defloration.
-Huh?

123
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,125
We'll lose our virginity.
We've practiced enough.

124
00:12:02,417 --> 00:12:05,917
We'll find the world's cutest guys
and sleep with them.

125
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,042
Good idea.

126
00:12:09,417 --> 00:12:11,958
Do you have to use
such complicated words?

127
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,125
Do you already know who with?

128
00:12:20,292 --> 00:12:22,292
Jameelah was totally into Lukas.

129
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:25,583
A guy with doe eyes
who always reads books.

130
00:12:26,042 --> 00:12:27,792
What's so great about that?

131
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,917
Nico is way cooler.

132
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,292
Nico is a real artist.

133
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,792
And his pictures belong in a museum.

134
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:40,333
I was thinking Nico.

135
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:42,958
Nico? You've known him forever.

136
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:45,458
Yeah, that's why.

137
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:50,792
The first time's sure to be stressful.
I'd rather do it with someone I know well.

138
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,333
Yeah, but it should be special.

139
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,708
Are you scared?

140
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,667
Don't know.

141
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:03,333
I just don't want anything to go wrong,
with all the blood and all.

142
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:07,417
-He has to be super cute.
-With a six-pack. And hot.

143
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:11,625
It has to be romantic, I swear.
At sunset and madly in love.

144
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,917
Does the guy you want
just happen to be named...

145
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,750
-Lukas?
-Be quiet! Be quiet!

146
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,958
-Defloration with Lukas!
-Shut your mouth!

147
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,125
-Jameelah wants...
-No! No!

148
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:27,917
Now the moment has arrived.
Go over to your father.

149
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:30,958
Hello?

150
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,292
Mom, can you sign my report card?

151
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:40,792
Nini, where were you?

152
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,250
It's pretty bad.

153
00:13:52,292 --> 00:13:54,750
You have to put in more effort, Nini.

154
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:01,250
I also killed a guy
and shot up crystal meth.

155
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,625
I like it when I have a pebble in my shoe.

156
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,792
It's like someone were there.

157
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:39,125
Someone who's accompanying me
through the world.

158
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,833
Nini, where are you going now?

159
00:14:54,292 --> 00:14:58,583
-Have you done your homework?
-Rainer, it's break. Don't act all big.

160
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,750
Don't be mean to Rainer
because your dad took off.

161
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,708
Get lost, you freak!

162
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,125
Hey!

163
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,417
Girl, turn around when I talk to you.

164
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,458
-What?
-You going to see Amir?

165
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:20,333
Tell Jasna that Dragan is waiting for her.
I'll wait as long as I have to.

166
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,042
SERBIA RULES

167
00:15:29,917 --> 00:15:31,375
Hello?

168
00:15:31,917 --> 00:15:33,000
Amir?

169
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,125
Hello.

170
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,167
Amir here?

171
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,458
That's Amir's mother.

172
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,833
She doesn't know a word of German.

173
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:54,917
Jameelah says you can't even borrow
onions or eggs from her.

174
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,500
She doesn't understand either word.

175
00:15:57,792 --> 00:15:59,917
-Amir's brother.
-Hey, kid.

176
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,667
I used to be crazily in love with Tarik.

177
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,167
Because he wants to look after me.
Jameelah, too, but she hates it.

178
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,917
Where's Amir?

179
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:11,708
Amir?

180
00:16:12,042 --> 00:16:14,208
Turn the music down, Jasna!

181
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:18,292
-I'm going to Jameelah's. You coming?
-I can't.

182
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,292
Jasna's gone crazy.

183
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:24,375
Dragan got her a bikini,
now she wants to go to the pool with him.

184
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:30,292
-Turn down the music!
-Move it, gnome. Hey, girl.

185
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,708
Jasna, Amir and Tarik are Bosnians.

186
00:16:43,042 --> 00:16:47,500
They're all flipping out because Jasna
is engaged to a Serb, Dragan.

187
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:49,583
That dishonors the family.

188
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,958
Amir says the worst thing is
they can't go anywhere.

189
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,792
No one will invite them
to weddings and stuff.

190
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,792
But Jasna looks great.

191
00:16:58,333 --> 00:16:59,958
Amir can say what he wants.

192
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,417
Open up!

193
00:17:02,042 --> 00:17:03,917
I swear, Jasna, open up!

194
00:17:05,042 --> 00:17:07,833
-Okay, are you coming?
-I can't. No.

195
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:09,958
I have to watch her. On break!

196
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,917
Dude, I'm not a girl!

197
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,292
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

198
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,667
Jasna was dancing around
in just a yellow bikini? Cool!

199
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,458
It's not funny.

200
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,667
Don't cut such big pieces.

201
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:29,292
They yelled all night.
I'm so tired. I didn't sleep a wink.

202
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:34,417
But they don't care.
They only think of themselves.

203
00:17:36,417 --> 00:17:38,083
Tarik Is just jealous.

204
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:42,333
-That dogface will never get a girl.
-He's no dogface.

205
00:17:44,792 --> 00:17:46,500
Mom, I don't speak Arabic.

206
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:51,125
Butt into other people's business,
you'll hear things you don't like.

207
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:55,375
-I just gave my opinion.
-I want you two to stay out of it. Got it?

208
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:57,583
All right already.

209
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:02,458
Mom, you look like Ms. Struck.

210
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,958
Give me your plate.

211
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,000
Attention!

212
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,167
Project Defloration.

213
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:20,333
Back there, lying there all by itself.

214
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:24,500
Stay calm, cool and slick.

215
00:18:34,792 --> 00:18:37,833
-Hi, Lukas.
-I'm surprised he has an mp3 player.

216
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,792
At his school they learn math
with peach pits.

217
00:18:41,292 --> 00:18:42,875
Laura told me that.

218
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:46,042
They hang sheets
in the corners of the rooms

219
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,458
and build pizza ovens
instead of learning vocab.

220
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,458
-Got a towel for me?
-Salam.

221
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,375
-Salam.
-Take mine.

222
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:57,000
-I'm not going in the water.
-Hey, Amir.

223
00:18:57,292 --> 00:18:59,083
I'm scared of water.

224
00:18:59,542 --> 00:19:04,833
Jameelah and Amir are scared of fireworks,
and that's why they don't laugh at me.

225
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,375
-Is that pork?
-They understand.

226
00:19:07,667 --> 00:19:09,333
-Poultry.
-They're friends.

227
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:12,667
-You see the security dudes?
-There was a knifing.

228
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,292
So they've been here since then.

229
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:23,333
What are you doing?
Sausage and chocolate?

230
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,542
Lt tastes good. Really!

231
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,208
-Like meat, just sweet.
-Sweetmeat.

232
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,708
Sweaty meat.

233
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,833
-The hot meat.
-Itchy meat.

234
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,292
Put your meat up.

235
00:19:33,792 --> 00:19:35,333
That's really poetic.

236
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,167
Meat and tidy.

237
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:40,833
Okay, listen here.
Here comes the best one of all.

238
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:42,875
Meat around the bush!

239
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,250
-Hey, guys.
-Hi.

240
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,875
-Well?
-Hey there.

241
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,167
-Hey, Lukas.
-Hi, Anna-Lena.

242
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:53,542
-How is my favorite cousin?
-Everything's cool.

243
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:58,917
By the way, Nini, your little sister
Is making out with some guy back there.

244
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,458
How old is she anyway?

245
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:09,542
Can someone play Carmina Burana?
I'm going to do a double loop.

246
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:23,875
-Well, how was 1?
-Yo mama, I was scared as hell.

247
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:30,333
Come on.

248
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:33,042
-It's not so bad.
-Don't look down!

249
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,125
Wussy!

250
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:41,958
Damn.

251
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:47,208
You little pussy,
get the hell out of here!

252
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,583
What a loser, dude!

253
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,667
Chicken shit.

254
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:58,667
You have no clue.
Your balls can explode on impact.

255
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:03,708
-What? Who fed you that bull?
-It's not bull. Tarik told me that.

256
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,458
-And Tarik's full of crap.
-Bite it.

257
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,792
-Bite it harder.
-Stop it!

258
00:21:09,292 --> 00:21:11,042
Anyone want a Popsicle?

259
00:21:35,917 --> 00:21:38,125
Hey, what are you looking at?

260
00:21:38,667 --> 00:21:41,917
-I'm not looking at anything.
-Look somewhere else!

261
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:43,750
Leave her alone.

262
00:21:44,042 --> 00:21:45,417
Shut up!

263
00:21:48,292 --> 00:21:50,417
-Stupid shit!
-Leave him be.

264
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,833
-Hi, Nini.
-Hi, Nico.

265
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,583
-Do you have the munchies?
-Always.

266
00:23:43,292 --> 00:23:47,458
I LOVE YOU, MY ANGEL,
ANNA-LENA

267
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,167
Let me go, you cripple!

268
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,250
-Amir!
-Tarik?

269
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,875
Crap.

270
00:23:57,167 --> 00:23:59,417
-Poor Jasna.
-Give her the towel.

271
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:02,167
Hey, that's Nini's towel.

272
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:06,083
When my fiancé sees I'm gone
he's going to kill him.

273
00:24:06,417 --> 00:24:08,500
He's going to kill him eventually.

274
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,458
-He'll kill him if he doesn't leave me be.
-You should be ashamed!

275
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:18,333
You should be ashamed.

276
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:23,167
I'll wait for you out front.

277
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,417
It's like in the Middle Ages.

278
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,333
-Idiot.
-Should we come along?

279
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:32,125
No, stay here
and keep on popping zits instead.

280
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:46,250
Should we stop by Amir's?

281
00:24:46,542 --> 00:24:48,125
We'd better not.

282
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:55,167
You hear that?

283
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:57,042
Someone's crying.

284
00:25:07,292 --> 00:25:09,125
Hello, is someone there?

285
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:12,083
Jasna?

286
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:14,625
Everything okay?

287
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,792
Dragan can't help being Serbian.

288
00:25:22,458 --> 00:25:23,958
I love him.

289
00:25:24,583 --> 00:25:26,333
Where is he now?

290
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:29,583
He's coming in a bit.

291
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:35,250
I waited until Tarik went to the bathroom
then I took off.

292
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:42,042
I swear, if he doesn't leave me alone
there'll be big trouble.

293
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,167
But that's not what I want.

294
00:25:45,458 --> 00:25:48,458
Tarik's my brother,
no matter what happens.

295
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,708
You're nothing without family.

296
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:54,625
Hey, Tarik is just jealous
because you're engaged.

297
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:58,708
Are you really engaged?
Show me your ring.

298
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,250
-Is it real?
-Yeah.

299
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:11,250
The Serbs shot up Tarik's leg.

300
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:16,208
I understand
that he doesn't want her to be with him.

301
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,042
Serb, Sorb.

302
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:22,292
The poor Sorb isn't an asshole
just because he spits too much.

303
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:27,250
What? That "poor Sorb" used to throw rocks
at our heads. Don't you remember?

304
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:31,250
Come on, we have to plan our project.

305
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:36,250
-You mean "Project Depilation"?
-It's "Defloration," you loser.

306
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:42,917
Right, my friends,
I'd like to welcome you all here.

307
00:26:43,792 --> 00:26:48,167
The donations collected
during the Better World Initiative weeks

308
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,167
will go to our partner church
in Guatemala.

309
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,792
Human rights
are being trampled on there, yeah?

310
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:58,208
My mom would clock me
if I painted one of her sheets.

311
00:26:58,542 --> 00:27:00,208
FOR ABETTER WORLD

312
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,875
Excuse me.

313
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:06,083
The two of you are new.
Would you like to introduce yourselves?

314
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:08,125
I'm Stefan Kopps-Krager.

315
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,417
Yeah, she's Nini and I'm Jameelah.

316
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:15,250
I'm glad.

317
00:27:15,542 --> 00:27:17,750
That you're here. I'm really glad.

318
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:22,625
You can just see Klutz-Kruger's
third-world brain working away.

319
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:27,583
One potato, two potato, three potato...
and here we go.

320
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:30,417
Lovely name, Jameelah. Really lovely.

321
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,250
Arabs are very poetic people.

322
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:36,167
And where exactly are you from?

323
00:27:36,458 --> 00:27:39,750
-I'm from here.
-Of course, but I mean originally.

324
00:27:40,042 --> 00:27:43,042
Where are you from originally?
Not Germany, right?

325
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:46,292
From Iraq.

326
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:52,750
A beautiful country, beautiful landscapes.
The Iraqis are incredibly hospitable.

327
00:27:53,083 --> 00:27:56,375
But, sadly, human rights
are being violated there.

328
00:27:56,667 --> 00:27:59,167
Klutz-Kruger, a real detective.

329
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:02,083
I wouldn't be surprised
if he had a hard-on.

330
00:28:02,417 --> 00:28:04,417
What's with the dumb questions?

331
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:07,083
Why talk about Guatemala and Iraq?

332
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:10,792
I mean, how far away are those places?

333
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:14,125
What do you want to talk about?

334
00:28:15,375 --> 00:28:17,333
Injustice exists here too.

335
00:28:18,375 --> 00:28:21,792
-For example?
-Deporting people, that's unjust too.

336
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:23,208
Shut up!

337
00:28:25,708 --> 00:28:29,083
Why? Who's going to be deported?

338
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,708
No one. That was just an example.

339
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,542
There are good things too.
Jameelah is being naturalized.

340
00:28:36,833 --> 00:28:38,708
Uh-huh. I'm happy for you.

341
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:43,083
Then she'll be a real German.
We'll have a potato party.

342
00:28:43,375 --> 00:28:44,958
-Right?
-Yeah.

343
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:46,750
Great.

344
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:49,208
In two weeks we'll talk about...

345
00:28:50,042 --> 00:28:52,292
Lukas is so sweet! He's mega-sweet.

346
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:54,333
What's up with you two?

347
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:56,500
I don't know. Nothing really.

348
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:01,458
That's new. Nico did it.

349
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:05,250
Man, he's really good.

350
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:12,458
Damn, I mean,
maybe it's because of Lukas' school.

351
00:29:13,292 --> 00:29:17,250
Laura said they don't have sex ed
till they're 14, so if he just...

352
00:29:17,542 --> 00:29:19,958
Nonsense. Lukas isn't that stupid.

353
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:25,375
What's going on over there?

354
00:29:29,458 --> 00:29:31,250
Please make some space here.

355
00:29:32,167 --> 00:29:34,542
-Sorry, No access.
-I live here.

356
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:38,750
No one can enter the building.
Marco, can you take care of them?

357
00:29:43,792 --> 00:29:47,458
-I don't want to talk!
-Tarik locked Jasna in the apartment.

358
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:50,583
She won't let anyone in.
Wants to blow the place up.

359
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:52,292
I...

360
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:55,833
don't want...

361
00:29:57,833 --> 00:30:00,583
... to talk to any of you!

362
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:08,000
Dragan...

363
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,500
Dragan, where are you?

364
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:13,500
-Where's my fiancé?
-Stop! What are you doing?

365
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:17,375
-Stop!
-Who's Dragan? Can someone get Dragan?

366
00:30:17,958 --> 00:30:21,708
-I saw him headed to the gym.
-There's always a way out!

367
00:30:22,042 --> 00:30:24,417
-You don't have to die!
-Yeah, right.

368
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:28,417
-What do you know about my life?
-You can tell me about it.

369
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:31,083
Jump!

370
00:30:31,417 --> 00:30:33,917
Jump, you little Chetnik slut!

371
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:37,917
You can't tell me what to do.
You're not my father!

372
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,667
Your father?

373
00:30:40,458 --> 00:30:44,458
-Don't talk to your sister that way.
-That isn't my sister.

374
00:30:44,792 --> 00:30:46,583
Jump! Die! You're a pain.

375
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:54,125
I'm going to kill you.
I'll kill all of you!

376
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:59,542
Now she's going to blow up the building.
I bet she blows it up.

377
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:06,250
That feels weird.
I don't look good in gold.

378
00:31:06,542 --> 00:31:08,417
This is sexy. Take this.

379
00:31:09,958 --> 00:31:13,125
And this one? It looks pretty good.
You could try it on.

380
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:15,500
Take this one.

381
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:18,875
Nini, I spoke to your mother.
You can sleep here.

382
00:31:19,458 --> 00:31:22,708
I have to go to work.
I'm trusting you guys, okay?

383
00:31:23,042 --> 00:31:24,792
-Yeah, sure.
-Sure.

384
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,417
Okay.

385
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:39,292
-Um, this looks sexy.
-I think this is good.

386
00:31:40,583 --> 00:31:41,667
Matching outfits.

387
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:44,708
-Whoa!
-I think this is really sexy.

388
00:31:46,208 --> 00:31:48,875
-I like these.
-Look! A little pussy.

389
00:31:53,958 --> 00:31:57,375
-I don't know. There he is.
-We're here about your sister.

390
00:31:58,042 --> 00:32:02,250
Is it true your sister was released
from the hospital two days ago?

391
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,625
She is now in a secret place
to protect her from her family?

392
00:32:06,917 --> 00:32:08,417
Don't know.

393
00:32:08,708 --> 00:32:12,208
-Why did she want to take her life?
-Amir, are you ready?

394
00:32:12,958 --> 00:32:15,417
Do you know
why she wanted to kill herself?

395
00:32:15,708 --> 00:32:20,458
-She just had a sprained ankle.
-Sprained ankle! That was a cry for help.

396
00:32:20,792 --> 00:32:25,458
-Young girls like you should...
-You're annoying. Go interview some Nazis.

397
00:32:29,292 --> 00:32:31,625
-I'm Muslim.
-You don't drink alcohol?

398
00:32:31,917 --> 00:32:33,500
No, forget it.

399
00:32:34,167 --> 00:32:36,833
-You don't drink, yo mama.
-I don't!

400
00:32:37,167 --> 00:32:40,375
I'll get in trouble.
I'm Muslim, I don't drink.

401
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:45,208
-Come on, you can drink a sip of beer.
-No way. I don't drink, you know that.

402
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,958
-Hey, Jameelah.
-Hey, Lukas.

403
00:32:48,708 --> 00:32:51,042
-Are you doing all right?
-Uh-huh.

404
00:32:54,042 --> 00:32:55,458
Hello.

405
00:32:58,792 --> 00:33:00,458
Give me a beer.

406
00:33:04,375 --> 00:33:06,167
-There you are.
-Hey.

407
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:11,208
-Is he looking at me?
-Guys, bus party time!

408
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:20,375
Here comes the party bus, sha-la-la-la-la!

409
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:24,125
Here comes the party bus,
sha-la-la-la-la-la!

410
00:33:24,417 --> 00:33:28,292
-Awesome. I hope it's warm like last year.
-It'll be the bomb.

411
00:33:28,792 --> 00:33:30,792
Anna-Lena, fluffy and soft.

412
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,708
Like she's been washed
with fabric softener.

413
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,375
She loves him.

414
00:33:36,667 --> 00:33:38,875
Yeah, but he's her cousin.

415
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:41,667
-So0? It's not forbidden.
-Still.

416
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:44,708
You don't do that.

417
00:33:45,042 --> 00:33:50,375
We're Stella Stardust and Sophia Saturna.
Anna-Lena is Frida Giga, Frigida.

418
00:33:50,667 --> 00:33:52,833
The most frigid cow in the world.

419
00:33:54,917 --> 00:33:56,833
Today I'm all about it.

420
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,542
-Tonight it's on. It's our night.
-Our night!

421
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:04,458
Okay, go!

422
00:34:05,917 --> 00:34:08,333
-Ow! You nuts?
-There was an insect.

423
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:13,333
-Ha ha, very funny.
-You notice how everyone's dumb except us?

424
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:17,750
-Where's Jameelah?
-Up front with that guy.

425
00:34:18,042 --> 00:34:21,417
-His name's Lukas.
-No clue, but he's a purebred fag.

426
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:25,708
-Jameelah can hit on him all she wants.
-You can't just say that.

427
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:29,708
-You'll see, the night's still young.
-But...

428
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,333
You don't like guys like that, right?

429
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,875
-You don't care anyway.
-As if!

430
00:34:35,167 --> 00:34:38,125
Hey, no!
Hey, Nico, please put me down.

431
00:34:38,417 --> 00:34:41,167
Come on, let's get this party started!

432
00:34:55,292 --> 00:34:57,750
I'm banning you from my head

433
00:35:04,792 --> 00:35:06,667
I'm banning you from my head

434
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:35,083
We dance to our own tune
Leave the place in pieces

435
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:37,708
I'm banning you from my head

436
00:35:38,958 --> 00:35:42,625
We dance to our own tune
Leave the place in pieces

437
00:35:42,917 --> 00:35:45,542
I'm banning you from my head...

438
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:25,708
At night we're the kings, y'all
At night we're the kings, y'all

439
00:36:26,042 --> 00:36:30,458
At night we're the kings, y'all
We're the kings of the night...

440
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:16,583
What time is it?

441
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:58,292
Everything's spinning.

442
00:38:00,792 --> 00:38:04,667
-I have to go to the bathroom.
-You have to sleep, sweetheart.

443
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:15,708
I have to go to the bathroom.

444
00:38:50,792 --> 00:38:51,708
So?

445
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:56,625
Nothing.

446
00:38:56,917 --> 00:39:01,208
-What do you mean, nothing?
-Nothing. He fell asleep, or pretended to.

447
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:04,083
When I woke up he was gone.

448
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:07,583
He might have just gotten scared.

449
00:39:09,333 --> 00:39:12,792
I told him that I love him.
I shouldn't have done that.

450
00:39:18,542 --> 00:39:21,833
Let's get out of here
or I'll get major depression.

451
00:39:39,417 --> 00:39:40,958
Are you nuts?

452
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:44,167
I just need her phone
to get Lukas' number.

453
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:54,000
MAGIC SPELLS

454
00:40:08,417 --> 00:40:10,375
Lukas, yeah? My Lukas.

455
00:40:10,667 --> 00:40:14,625
She wants to curse him
because she can't get him. That cow!

456
00:40:15,458 --> 00:40:19,500
Always acting all nice.
"Love you, my angel, your Anna-Lena."

457
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:22,667
I want to barf.
I mean it, I've about had it.

458
00:40:23,833 --> 00:40:25,250
And he...

459
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:28,833
Horrible. It's really horrible.

460
00:40:34,375 --> 00:40:38,250
As if I were a piece of meat
that someone didn't want to eat.

461
00:40:39,167 --> 00:40:42,125
Like kebab meat
that you leave on your plate.

462
00:40:42,708 --> 00:40:44,708
Along with a dirty napkin.

463
00:40:47,042 --> 00:40:48,625
He just took off.

464
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:55,333
I'm sure there's a simple explanation.
Like maybe he had to go somewhere.

465
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,917
And tomorrow he's going...

466
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,208
Tomorrow he's going
to Lake Garda with Anna-Lena.

467
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,542
Because his parents

468
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,125
and her parents...

469
00:41:07,917 --> 00:41:09,333
Call him.

470
00:41:10,458 --> 00:41:13,042
But I don't have his damn number!

471
00:41:15,083 --> 00:41:16,500
And...

472
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:26,667
This really sounds absolutely bonkers,

473
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:31,167
but will you help me
conjure up a love spell tonight?

474
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:36,708
Sure.

475
00:41:37,458 --> 00:41:39,250
We have to be naked.

476
00:41:39,542 --> 00:41:42,417
At the stroke of midnight.
Will you be there?

477
00:41:45,042 --> 00:41:47,792
Yeah,
if it means you won't be sad anymore.

478
00:42:12,458 --> 00:42:15,333
Today I had
my first real childhood memory.

479
00:42:16,458 --> 00:42:20,042
You can't have one of those
until you're not a kid anymore.

480
00:42:20,333 --> 00:42:22,958
I can't remember
a thing from my childhood.

481
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:25,708
Then maybe you're still a child.

482
00:42:26,708 --> 00:42:28,417
I just thought of something.

483
00:42:28,708 --> 00:42:32,958
I once found two rabbits in a trash can.
They weren't dead, but nearly.

484
00:42:34,958 --> 00:42:37,875
It was some summer in Iraq.
I was still little.

485
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:42,500
And my cousin beat them to death
with a ping pong paddle.

486
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:47,042
I can't remember anything else.
Maybe it's better that way.

487
00:42:51,458 --> 00:42:54,958
Look up at that constellation.
It's Sophia Saturna.

488
00:42:56,417 --> 00:42:58,833
And there's Stella Stardust.

489
00:43:01,458 --> 00:43:03,667
I hope everything works out.

490
00:43:12,208 --> 00:43:13,958
It's 12 on the dot.

491
00:43:42,292 --> 00:43:43,792
Here we go.

492
00:43:44,083 --> 00:43:47,708
He whose name we whisper
as we scatter roses by the full moon,

493
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,708
his love shall we gain.

494
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:54,208
Lukas, Lukas, Lukas...

495
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,292
Nico, Nico, Nico...

496
00:44:31,625 --> 00:44:33,667
Jameelah, I feel dizzy.

497
00:44:40,875 --> 00:44:42,542
Someone's coming!

498
00:44:50,542 --> 00:44:51,458
Jasna.

499
00:45:00,708 --> 00:45:02,125
Head down!

500
00:45:02,417 --> 00:45:04,250
It'll be your stupid Serb.

501
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:06,917
You can throw stones at his head.

502
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:12,083
It's Tarik.

503
00:45:15,167 --> 00:45:16,792
Come home now.

504
00:45:17,417 --> 00:45:20,125
Can we go? We're done casting spells.

505
00:45:20,917 --> 00:45:22,042
I'm cold!

506
00:45:30,417 --> 00:45:32,250
He's off his falafel.

507
00:45:41,625 --> 00:45:43,250
Is he crying?

508
00:45:56,333 --> 00:45:58,583
Man, can't they just make up?

509
00:45:58,917 --> 00:46:00,750
They have to eventually.

510
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:39,542
The left hand. His left hand.

511
00:47:30,958 --> 00:47:32,500
She's dead.

512
00:47:46,917 --> 00:47:49,375
-What are you doing?
-Shut up and help me!

513
00:48:06,125 --> 00:48:08,042
Come on, let's get out of here.

514
00:48:51,792 --> 00:48:53,500
What do we do now?

515
00:48:54,083 --> 00:48:55,667
Nothing at all.

516
00:48:59,167 --> 00:49:01,125
But we have to do something.

517
00:49:02,917 --> 00:49:04,875
No. We'll chuck it all out.

518
00:49:05,875 --> 00:49:08,042
Rose petals, jewelry, everything.

519
00:49:09,417 --> 00:49:13,000
So why did we take it then?
I thought you had a reason.

520
00:49:13,667 --> 00:49:15,958
A religious reason or something.

521
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:19,167
Religion? Since when do I have a religion?

522
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:22,000
And why do I always have to have a plan?

523
00:49:27,833 --> 00:49:29,375
I'm scared.

524
00:49:35,875 --> 00:49:37,958
-I have to go home.
-Wait.

525
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:24,167
... I've lived in this building
for over 30 years...

526
00:50:47,417 --> 00:50:49,000
Where's Amir?

527
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:52,250
No idea.

528
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,417
-I'll kill you, you cripple!
-Oh shit.

529
00:51:01,708 --> 00:51:03,875
I'll kill you, you cripple.

530
00:51:07,042 --> 00:51:09,667
Start praying to your Allah right now!

531
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,750
You killed her, it's your fault!

532
00:51:12,083 --> 00:51:15,917
You killed her!
I know that you killed her!

533
00:51:16,208 --> 00:51:17,333
Pray to your Allah!

534
00:51:17,667 --> 00:51:20,458
Jameelah, Nini, get up here right now!

535
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:47,667
Nini, go home when you've eaten.

536
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:54,958
-Eat.
-I'm not that hungry.

537
00:51:57,542 --> 00:52:01,167
These people don't know anything else,
just war and misery.

538
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,500
That's what they're used to.

539
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,625
We're not in Germany
to keep killing each other.

540
00:52:09,958 --> 00:52:12,167
-Stop! It's annoying.
-Annoying?

541
00:52:12,458 --> 00:52:15,042
-A girl was killed outside our door.
-Stop!

542
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:17,417
Jameelah!

543
00:52:24,333 --> 00:52:25,958
I don't speak Arabic!

544
00:52:26,292 --> 00:52:30,458
I said let them go back
where they're from and murder each other.

545
00:52:30,792 --> 00:52:34,083
Then it's okay?
So Dad and Youssef's deaths were okay?

546
00:52:34,375 --> 00:52:36,250
That's not what I said!

547
00:52:39,375 --> 00:52:41,375
It's enough already. Enough!

548
00:52:52,625 --> 00:52:55,750
Let's go do something. Something nice.

549
00:52:57,375 --> 00:52:59,000
Something oh-some!

550
00:53:01,833 --> 00:53:03,458
Yes!

551
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:22,333
So, do you have any plans today?

552
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:24,833
Costs 100 euros.

553
00:53:28,125 --> 00:53:32,458
-Actually, I never do this.
-Actually, we never do this either.

554
00:53:41,917 --> 00:53:46,125
-Milk, passion fruit juice and brandy.
-I invited someone, a buddy.

555
00:53:46,417 --> 00:53:48,208
He'll be here soon. Thanks.

556
00:53:48,542 --> 00:53:51,000
A buddy? That wasn't part of the deal.

557
00:53:51,333 --> 00:53:53,042
That'll cost another 100.

558
00:53:53,875 --> 00:53:57,083
No worries,
you don't need to be afraid of him.

559
00:53:57,417 --> 00:53:59,000
He's just a half-pint.

560
00:54:02,833 --> 00:54:04,708
-Hello!
-Hello there!

561
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,083
Right, sit on his lap.
Today is his birthday.

562
00:54:10,625 --> 00:54:12,250
Come here.

563
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:14,000
To me.

564
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:15,750
To you!

565
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:27,333
I don't think adults are really alive.

566
00:54:27,958 --> 00:54:31,292
But when they touch our stockings
and make out with us

567
00:54:31,583 --> 00:54:33,917
they start to light up, like neon fish.

568
00:54:35,125 --> 00:54:36,750
It's us who light them up.

569
00:55:09,583 --> 00:55:12,042
-You don't feel anything at all?
-No.

570
00:55:12,333 --> 00:55:15,875
-What happened?
-Afghanistan. Friendly fire.

571
00:55:16,167 --> 00:55:18,542
So it was the good guys who shot at you?

572
00:55:18,875 --> 00:55:20,375
War really sucks.

573
00:55:21,417 --> 00:55:22,833
Hey!

574
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:26,667
Right.

575
00:55:32,417 --> 00:55:34,833
All right, let's drink up now!

576
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:38,375
Why? Why already?

577
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:42,583
We'll go somewhere else.

578
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:03,500
-We've never gone to a hotel with men.
-Sophia Saturna, it's down to business.

579
00:56:04,208 --> 00:56:05,625
Mission Defloration.

580
00:56:48,792 --> 00:56:53,333
Lt feels like when Mom put me
on the pink horse at the store as a kid.

581
00:56:53,958 --> 00:56:57,125
The one you could ride
for a minute for 50 cents.

582
00:57:00,833 --> 00:57:03,500
Screwing isn't any harder than riding.

583
00:57:05,833 --> 00:57:09,333
And it's over faster
than a 50-cent horsy ride.

584
00:57:35,792 --> 00:57:37,417
Give me that.

585
00:57:40,208 --> 00:57:43,042
-Your visa is about to run out.
-I know that.

586
00:57:44,625 --> 00:57:47,833
"Jameelah."
That means "beautiful" in Arabic.

587
00:57:48,958 --> 00:57:50,875
Was that your first time?

588
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:53,917
Why didn't you say so?

589
00:57:54,208 --> 00:57:57,458
We could've done it up the butt
So you could marry as a virgin.

590
00:57:59,292 --> 00:58:00,917
What are you gawking at?

591
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:16,667
Take it.

592
00:58:27,417 --> 00:58:29,833
Amir really loves that cologne.

593
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:54,333
Oh my God!

594
00:59:04,083 --> 00:59:05,667
Oh my God!

595
00:59:07,958 --> 00:59:09,583
Did you bleed?

596
00:59:11,042 --> 00:59:12,375
No.

597
00:59:12,667 --> 00:59:15,958
I read you don't necessarily bleed
the first time.

598
00:59:21,708 --> 00:59:23,417
But pretty damn oh-some.

599
00:59:23,708 --> 00:59:25,250
Yeah, really oh-some.

600
00:59:34,292 --> 00:59:37,500
-Hey, have you seen Nini?
-She was headed that way.

601
00:59:52,708 --> 00:59:54,125
Hurry up!

602
01:00:00,167 --> 01:00:01,667
Nini! Nini...

603
01:00:02,625 --> 01:00:06,958
Why don't you answer your phone?
I tried to call a thousand times.

604
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:10,708
What are you doing?
Have you started collecting bottles?

605
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,083
Ha ha. So what's up?

606
01:00:13,417 --> 01:00:15,875
What's up? Jasna was stabbed to death!

607
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:20,125
-We know that.
-Did you know the cops arrested Amir?

608
01:00:21,042 --> 01:00:22,458
What?

609
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,417
-Are you drunk?
-Amir? Why?

610
01:00:25,875 --> 01:00:27,792
Why? He said he did it.

611
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:31,833
Nini.

612
01:00:34,583 --> 01:00:36,000
Here.

613
01:00:40,708 --> 01:00:43,958
-He didn't do it.
-Of course he didn't do it.

614
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:47,625
He couldn't even burn an ant
with a magnifying glass.

615
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:50,583
-But prove that.
-We can prove it.

616
01:00:50,875 --> 01:00:52,958
-How?
-Nini, you're burning up.

617
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:55,583
Are you sick? We have to go home now.

618
01:00:55,917 --> 01:01:00,042
-Let me go! Are you nuts?
-You are. We agreed to keep quiet.

619
01:01:00,333 --> 01:01:05,000
-They hadn't arrested Amir yet!
-Still, we had a deal not to say anything.

620
01:01:05,292 --> 01:01:08,833
Agreement! Deal! You're so German.
Amir is innocent!

621
01:01:09,125 --> 01:01:11,708
I'm so German?
No, you're so German.

622
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,458
You're so naive.

623
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:17,000
You have no idea
what went down there last night.

624
01:01:17,292 --> 01:01:18,875
It wasn't just murder.

625
01:01:19,167 --> 01:01:22,875
Jasna dancing with her Serb
and drinking all night.

626
01:01:23,167 --> 01:01:26,167
That's living dangerously.
And they planned it.

627
01:01:26,458 --> 01:01:28,500
If Amir said he did it, he's in on it.

628
01:01:28,792 --> 01:01:32,625
But we have to help Amir.
We have to go to the police, Jameelah.

629
01:01:33,625 --> 01:01:37,833
We can't go to the police.
You have no idea what that could mean.

630
01:01:38,125 --> 01:01:42,833
You don't have to be afraid of being sent
to a country with camel-dung houses.

631
01:01:43,125 --> 01:01:47,167
-That has nothing to do with it.
-This Jasna mess means big trouble.

632
01:01:47,458 --> 01:01:50,417
I need calm
till the immigration stuff is over.

633
01:01:50,708 --> 01:01:54,833
And ratting on Tarik is dangerous.
For them it's "an eye for an eye."

634
01:01:55,125 --> 01:01:58,750
-It could get even worse.
-How could it get any worse?

635
01:01:59,042 --> 01:02:04,125
Imagine you get home, the cops are there
and your mom and Jessi are dead.

636
01:02:04,458 --> 01:02:06,000
Just imagine it.

637
01:02:09,958 --> 01:02:11,917
Your father and Youssef...

638
01:02:13,042 --> 01:02:14,958
It was just an example, okay?

639
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:21,417
-What did your dad do?
-You dumb? Or don't you want to get it?

640
01:02:21,708 --> 01:02:23,083
Or both?

641
01:02:23,375 --> 01:02:28,375
They died because no one protected them,
not because they did something wrong.

642
01:02:28,667 --> 01:02:32,917
No human rights, no protection.
Even Klutz-Kruger got that.

643
01:02:34,458 --> 01:02:37,375
Then go to the police,
but keep me out of it.

644
01:02:38,208 --> 01:02:40,625
And then we won't be friends anymore.

645
01:02:49,708 --> 01:02:52,292
Listen here, we'll go to the cops.

646
01:02:53,083 --> 01:02:54,667
But not yet.

647
01:02:54,958 --> 01:02:56,708
First we'll talk to Amir.

648
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,708
He has to tell the truth.

649
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:00,917
That's the only way.

650
01:03:01,417 --> 01:03:04,042
Until then,
swear you won't go to the cops.

651
01:03:05,708 --> 01:03:07,208
Pinkie promise.

652
01:03:17,375 --> 01:03:20,208
Dude, why didn't we get the smaller one?

653
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:22,417
You know Amir, he eats for two.

654
01:03:26,792 --> 01:03:29,000
Finally! What took you so long?

655
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:32,750
-Got our visitor's permits?
-That can't go in.

656
01:03:33,083 --> 01:03:35,917
-Why not?
-It's a jail, not a youth hostel.

657
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:39,875
We've lugged it this far,
we'll get it in somehow.

658
01:03:50,417 --> 01:03:54,708
No gifts, no exchanges.
You can kiss and hug to say hello and bye.

659
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,833
No other physical contact.

660
01:04:03,375 --> 01:04:06,083
-Great to see you, dude.
-Salam, brother.

661
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:12,208
-Got a good lawyer?
-A lady's defending me for free.

662
01:04:12,667 --> 01:04:14,083
And the trial?

663
01:04:14,375 --> 01:04:18,792
Juvenile cases have to be speedy.
If I'm lucky, I'll get five years.

664
01:04:19,083 --> 01:04:21,708
Then they'll send me straight to Sarajevo.

665
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,750
Amir, what are you doing?

666
01:04:28,625 --> 01:04:30,917
You're messing up your life, dude.

667
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:34,667
It wasn't you, was it?

668
01:04:36,958 --> 01:04:39,042
I don't want to live in Germany anyway.

669
01:04:39,333 --> 01:04:42,250
I can take the GED
and college prep classes here.

670
01:04:43,042 --> 01:04:47,917
-I'll study medicine or work in soccer.
-Did Tarik feed you that bull?

671
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:52,125
Did he say that if you took the rap
you'd be the family savior?

672
01:04:53,208 --> 01:04:54,500
He say that?

673
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:58,083
Amir, go over to him
and tell him the truth.

674
01:05:00,167 --> 01:05:03,750
You're such a coward!
Family savior, yeah right!

675
01:05:04,417 --> 01:05:07,375
-Know what you are? A sissy!
-Stop, Jameelah!

676
01:05:07,667 --> 01:05:12,708
Jameelah, always the little know-it-all!
As if you knew more about life!

677
01:05:13,042 --> 01:05:15,458
You don't get it. You have no family!

678
01:05:15,792 --> 01:05:17,500
-Kiss my ass!
-You kiss mine!

679
01:05:17,792 --> 01:05:19,625
-Sit down!
-Screw off, potato!

680
01:05:19,917 --> 01:05:22,125
Separate now or the visit is over.

681
01:05:23,292 --> 01:05:24,792
Sit down.

682
01:05:30,375 --> 01:05:31,958
Amir, listen.

683
01:05:32,958 --> 01:05:35,542
We just want you to rethink this, okay?

684
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:39,833
You are innocent.

685
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:43,792
Sure, family is important and all.

686
01:05:44,583 --> 01:05:47,000
But Jasna was part of your family too.

687
01:05:49,542 --> 01:05:51,667
You're protecting her murderer.

688
01:05:54,667 --> 01:05:56,792
She wasn't my real sister.

689
01:05:57,083 --> 01:05:58,708
Just a half-sister.

690
01:05:59,458 --> 01:06:00,875
What do you mean?

691
01:06:04,625 --> 01:06:06,500
It happened in the war.

692
01:06:07,792 --> 01:06:10,875
The Chetniks... My mother, they...

693
01:06:12,583 --> 01:06:14,375
They raped her.

694
01:06:14,667 --> 01:06:16,208
Tarik screamed.

695
01:06:17,583 --> 01:06:19,458
And he wanted to help her.

696
01:06:21,292 --> 01:06:22,875
They shot his leg up.

697
01:06:28,333 --> 01:06:33,250
And then they tied Tarik up to my mother
and threw them in the river.

698
01:06:42,542 --> 01:06:45,750
I didn't want Jasna to die.
You have to believe me.

699
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:50,625
Of course we believe you
or we wouldn't be here.

700
01:06:50,958 --> 01:06:52,458
We'll help you.

701
01:06:53,167 --> 01:06:54,792
Visiting time is up.

702
01:06:55,083 --> 01:06:56,625
Say goodbye.

703
01:06:57,875 --> 01:06:59,375
Come along.

704
01:07:18,792 --> 01:07:21,875
THE MURDERER SCATTERED RED ROSES

705
01:07:36,042 --> 01:07:37,667
Yum, game stew!

706
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:41,375
-You're such an animal.
-This really hits the spot.

707
01:07:41,667 --> 01:07:44,417
How can you eat now?
Especially food for Amir.

708
01:07:44,708 --> 01:07:48,833
Sorry, I'm hungry. Should I fast?
That won't set Amir free either.

709
01:07:52,417 --> 01:07:54,125
I'm getting off here.

710
01:07:57,750 --> 01:07:58,667
Bye.

711
01:07:59,333 --> 01:08:01,000
-Bye.
-Bye.

712
01:08:12,458 --> 01:08:15,375
What was that?
Are the two of you a couple now?

713
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:17,667
No way.

714
01:08:18,042 --> 01:08:22,250
-I don't know, okay.
-You don't have the guts. You're chicken.

715
01:08:23,708 --> 01:08:26,167
Don't you realize how lucky you are?

716
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:29,708
He'd do anything for you,
because he loves you.

717
01:08:30,042 --> 01:08:33,417
But you... No.
You know what? You're scared.

718
01:08:33,875 --> 01:08:37,375
That he'll run off and leave,
like your dad did to your mom.

719
01:08:37,667 --> 01:08:40,292
That's why you're avoiding it all. Coward!

720
01:08:41,333 --> 01:08:44,208
What a load of crap!
What about you and Lukas?

721
01:08:44,875 --> 01:08:48,375
Can you explain why that's not working?
Smartass!

722
01:08:48,667 --> 01:08:51,750
German naturalization test.
Can you quiz me?

723
01:08:57,792 --> 01:09:02,875
Stop drinking the eggnog! You're 12!
You'll get brain damage and deformed kids.

724
01:09:03,208 --> 01:09:06,667
-You look like hell. You got AIDS?
-Put the eggnog away.

725
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,083
No. You'll get AIDS. If I hear
about you making out at the pool...

726
01:09:11,958 --> 01:09:15,042
That was Pepi.
We've made out since kindergarten.

727
01:09:15,333 --> 01:09:17,875
-Can I get something sweet now?
-No!

728
01:09:18,167 --> 01:09:20,167
I hate you! You suck so much!

729
01:09:20,458 --> 01:09:23,708
-Jessi, bed!
-Quiet or I'll make stew out of you both!

730
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,375
Nini, I can take you to the hospital.
I traded shifts.

731
01:09:27,667 --> 01:09:29,375
-Really?
-Have you packed?

732
01:09:29,667 --> 01:09:30,542
Yeah.

733
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,792
-Come on, Jessi. Move!
-Yes!

734
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:35,417
What's this scrawled here?

735
01:09:36,083 --> 01:09:39,417
"Would not..."
No, "Could not... of show..."?

736
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:44,042
"Worry not of showers, like a sundial
count sunny hours. Love, Daddy"

737
01:09:44,375 --> 01:09:46,917
-Why'd he write that?
-It's a saying.

738
01:09:47,208 --> 01:09:50,917
Yo mama! He takes off
but tells his daughter to be all sunny.

739
01:09:51,208 --> 01:09:54,458
-That's crappy.
-Watch out, don't smudge it.

740
01:09:55,917 --> 01:10:01,667
Imagine it, we're out hanging with the hos
and your dad drives up. That'd be...

741
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,500
Just wrong!

742
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:10,625
Hey, if you really wanted to,
you could see him again.

743
01:10:10,958 --> 01:10:12,625
Or call him.

744
01:10:12,958 --> 01:10:17,000
I'd give him a piece of my mind
for abandoning his family like that.

745
01:10:24,292 --> 01:10:28,708
Angelika, if you happen to see me,
don't be scared and call in.

746
01:10:29,667 --> 01:10:31,833
I'm sitting here waiting for you.

747
01:10:32,125 --> 01:10:33,833
Please, please, come home.

748
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,417
-Hello?
-Hello, Joachim. How are you?

749
01:10:44,250 --> 01:10:46,875
-Who is this?
-You don't remember me?

750
01:10:47,292 --> 01:10:50,250
-Right now I don't...
-You have three guesses.

751
01:10:51,958 --> 01:10:53,375
-Wrong number.
-Hang up.

752
01:10:53,667 --> 01:10:58,000
"Worry not of showers, like a sundial
count sunny hours." How lame!

753
01:10:58,833 --> 01:11:00,500
Nini, is that you?

754
01:11:02,125 --> 01:11:04,458
-Daddy?
-Has something happened?

755
01:11:07,167 --> 01:11:10,833
Something up with your mom?
Is everything okay with you?

756
01:11:11,125 --> 01:11:12,500
Yes.

757
01:11:14,958 --> 01:11:17,542
I'm on the train. I can barely hear you.

758
01:11:25,292 --> 01:11:26,875
Hung up.

759
01:11:27,208 --> 01:11:30,542
It was just a dead zone.
I'll call him back again.

760
01:11:32,958 --> 01:11:34,375
No.

761
01:11:36,958 --> 01:11:38,667
Everything okay?

762
01:11:39,875 --> 01:11:41,458
I don't know.

763
01:11:42,875 --> 01:11:45,625
Strange.
I haven't spoken to him in so long.

764
01:11:47,083 --> 01:11:51,375
At least now you have his number
and can call him whenever you want.

765
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:55,250
What are we going to do with the boys?
Plan B...

766
01:11:55,542 --> 01:11:57,375
I'll never call my dad again.

767
01:11:57,667 --> 01:11:59,167
I know that.

768
01:11:59,625 --> 01:12:02,375
I wish I'd met him with the prostitutes.

769
01:12:02,667 --> 01:12:07,458
Sure, it would've meant trouble,
but Dad would have had to think of me.

770
01:12:07,792 --> 01:12:11,750
He'd have to think about
how badly his daughter is screwing up

771
01:12:12,042 --> 01:12:14,750
and would have to worry
about me at least once.

772
01:12:16,292 --> 01:12:19,250
-Should I take you in?
-No, I'll be fine.

773
01:12:19,542 --> 01:12:21,167
Take care. Bye!

774
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:34,667
You can't eat or drink anything
until tomorrow when it's over.

775
01:12:36,458 --> 01:12:40,792
All that's missing is the lake,
then it'd be like Lake Garda in Italy.

776
01:12:45,667 --> 01:12:47,375
What's with her?

777
01:12:47,667 --> 01:12:51,000
She's very weak.
Came from intensive care yesterday.

778
01:12:51,292 --> 01:12:52,958
Nylons and matches.

779
01:12:53,292 --> 01:12:54,958
She was lovesick.

780
01:13:24,375 --> 01:13:26,333
God's world is so rotten.

781
01:13:27,625 --> 01:13:31,083
Dad, boys, love spells,
it's all such bullshit.

782
01:13:32,333 --> 01:13:35,167
Jasna is dead. Amir is in jail.

783
01:13:36,125 --> 01:13:38,042
How can you just go on living?

784
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,583
Hey, sweetheart.

785
01:13:47,708 --> 01:13:49,417
Don't say anything.

786
01:13:50,667 --> 01:13:53,417
I know I look
like a deformed Chinese girl.

787
01:13:54,583 --> 01:13:59,125
More like a hamster that got socked
in the kisser, but it's kind of sweet.

788
01:14:00,208 --> 01:14:03,125
Does it still hurt?
Can I kiss you yet?

789
01:14:05,167 --> 01:14:06,583
Careful.

790
01:14:09,167 --> 01:14:11,250
I can't believe you came here...

791
01:14:11,542 --> 01:14:15,000
What did you think?
I'd go anywhere for you, okay?

792
01:14:15,458 --> 01:14:17,375
No matter where you are.

793
01:14:18,792 --> 01:14:21,292
I... I'd do anything for you.

794
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:23,875
Nico...

795
01:14:31,875 --> 01:14:35,542
-Visiting hours are nearly over.
-Yeah, I was just going.

796
01:14:38,083 --> 01:14:39,500
No, you weren't.

797
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:42,583
No, I wasn't?

798
01:14:54,917 --> 01:14:56,542
What's with her?

799
01:14:56,833 --> 01:14:58,542
Burn victim.

800
01:16:12,458 --> 01:16:14,000
Damn pants!

801
01:16:21,917 --> 01:16:24,833
-Everything okay?
-Yeah, everything's okay.

802
01:16:40,958 --> 01:16:43,333
This time I can feel everything.

803
01:16:43,625 --> 01:16:45,333
And it hurts pretty bad.

804
01:16:45,625 --> 01:16:49,417
A stabbing pain.
It's as if something's pinching me.

805
01:16:50,292 --> 01:16:53,875
And the pain from below
Is mixing with the pain in my jaw.

806
01:16:55,792 --> 01:16:57,708
Yet somehow it's beautiful.

807
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,917
I don't know, it sounds stupid,
but it's true.

808
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:26,375
Damn, is that yours? That's unbelievable.

809
01:17:28,833 --> 01:17:31,708
-It's normal.
-I know that, but still...

810
01:17:41,167 --> 01:17:44,208
I'm supposed to say hi from Amir.
I called him.

811
01:17:44,667 --> 01:17:47,667
-I want to talk to Amir too.
-It's way too late now.

812
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,958
-Why?
-Chill out, we'll do that tomorrow.

813
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:55,167
Besides, I have something for you.
Close your eyes.

814
01:18:02,333 --> 01:18:04,083
You can look now.

815
01:18:10,958 --> 01:18:13,417
I know it's a bit over the top, but...

816
01:18:13,833 --> 01:18:15,750
Do you like it all the same?

817
01:18:16,958 --> 01:18:19,333
-Where did you get it?
-I found it.

818
01:18:19,625 --> 01:18:23,250
I took it to the lost-and-found office
and no one claimed it.

819
01:18:23,542 --> 01:18:25,417
The jeweler said it's real.

820
01:18:30,333 --> 01:18:32,042
Nini, what's wrong?

821
01:18:36,833 --> 01:18:38,250
Here.

822
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:43,500
Can't you tell me what's up?

823
01:18:47,583 --> 01:18:50,042
Nico, I can't do this anymore. I...

824
01:18:51,208 --> 01:18:53,208
I can't take it any longer.

825
01:18:57,875 --> 01:19:02,250
Noura says brave people
are those who do things they're afraid of.

826
01:20:05,833 --> 01:20:08,417
They were constantly fighting...

827
01:20:31,208 --> 01:20:34,500
You betrayed me.
You don't give a crap if I get deported.

828
01:20:34,833 --> 01:20:38,333
You're so selfish.
Just so your conscience is clear.

829
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:41,833
I'll die in the desert,
get raped or bombed to pieces.

830
01:20:42,125 --> 01:20:45,042
-You don't give a crap.
-It's not all about you!

831
01:20:45,333 --> 01:20:47,542
I wanted to get Amir out of jail.

832
01:20:47,833 --> 01:20:50,458
Tarik killed Jasna. He's a murderer!

833
01:20:50,792 --> 01:20:53,958
If everyone stayed silent,
nothing would change.

834
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:56,833
Justice doesn't mean anything to you.

835
01:20:58,750 --> 01:21:00,708
I'm done with our friendship.

836
01:21:02,083 --> 01:21:03,125
Bite it!

837
01:21:04,708 --> 01:21:07,042
-Watch it.
-Oh yeah? Watch what?

838
01:21:07,333 --> 01:21:09,208
Do that again and you'll see.

839
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:24,750
Man, I'm sorry.

840
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:27,167
I'm sorry.

841
01:21:31,083 --> 01:21:32,417
Come on.

842
01:21:32,750 --> 01:21:34,167
Traitor!

843
01:21:34,792 --> 01:21:37,875
You're a goddamn traitor, you are!

844
01:21:38,167 --> 01:21:40,333
Nothing but a goddamn traitor!

845
01:21:41,042 --> 01:21:42,833
Ow! You're breaking my arm!

846
01:21:43,125 --> 01:21:44,833
You're breaking my arm!

847
01:21:51,917 --> 01:21:53,375
I'll kill you!

848
01:21:53,708 --> 01:21:56,292
I'll kill you. I'll kill you!

849
01:21:58,542 --> 01:22:00,250
I hate you.

850
01:22:04,875 --> 01:22:06,792
I'll kill you.

851
01:22:07,125 --> 01:22:09,208
Stop now, both of you! Right now!

852
01:22:10,875 --> 01:22:12,458
You suck, you're...

853
01:22:18,833 --> 01:22:20,375
What are you?

854
01:22:21,167 --> 01:22:23,375
Are you dogs or are you my friends?

855
01:22:27,333 --> 01:22:30,125
The two of you are to make up.
Did you hear me?

856
01:22:38,667 --> 01:22:40,292
I can do that.

857
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:50,667
Never.

858
01:22:58,625 --> 01:23:00,208
Great homecoming.

859
01:23:11,333 --> 01:23:16,833
Okay, don't worry, making a statement
will have no disadvantages for you.

860
01:23:18,375 --> 01:23:19,292
Fine.

861
01:23:19,917 --> 01:23:21,833
That'll be all for now.

862
01:23:23,583 --> 01:23:27,042
-What'll happen to Amir?
-He'll probably be put in a home.

863
01:23:27,333 --> 01:23:30,792
-Can't he stay with us?
-Youth Welfare will decide that.

864
01:24:13,792 --> 01:24:15,875
TRAITORS, DON'T BOTHER RINGING

865
01:25:26,208 --> 01:25:28,125
NATURALIZATION TEST

866
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:20,083
... H20.

867
01:26:20,375 --> 01:26:23,708
So the citric acid cycle's purpose
Is to transform

868
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,333
acetyl-CoA via an extensive series
of small chemical reactions.

869
01:26:28,625 --> 01:26:32,125
This is a simplified depiction of it
showing nine steps.

870
01:26:32,458 --> 01:26:35,958
That brings us to another step,
the respiratory chain.

871
01:26:36,250 --> 01:26:37,958
The respiratory chain.

872
01:26:42,042 --> 01:26:44,125
I'll take a shortcut here.

873
01:26:44,417 --> 01:26:48,583
Here, in the respiratory chain,
the hydrogen atoms are transformed

874
01:26:48,917 --> 01:26:50,500
from the coenzymes.

875
01:26:50,792 --> 01:26:54,042
And energy is created
during that transformation.

876
01:26:54,333 --> 01:26:59,208
That energy is energy in the form of heat
and energy in the form of ATP.

877
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:01,958
ATP is adenosine triphosphate.

878
01:27:02,958 --> 01:27:04,375
Jameelah?

879
01:27:07,208 --> 01:27:08,417
Jameelah?

880
01:27:10,208 --> 01:27:11,583
Here I am.

881
01:27:11,875 --> 01:27:16,833
Can you explain this partial reaction
in the citric acid cycle to me?

882
01:27:18,333 --> 01:27:20,750
No idea, I'm not into acid.

883
01:27:22,042 --> 01:27:25,458
Right, then welll... No.
No, Senad. I know you know it.

884
01:27:25,792 --> 01:27:30,708
But is there anyone else who would like
to improve their oral grade?

885
01:27:32,583 --> 01:27:35,417
A bit more enthusiasm, please. Amir?

886
01:27:36,458 --> 01:27:38,625
You're taking such detailed notes.

887
01:27:38,917 --> 01:27:40,833
No idea. Do I look like Senad?

888
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:46,083
Anyone else? Yes, Nini!
This is a surprise.

889
01:27:46,375 --> 01:27:49,500
Can you explain to me
how GTP is formed from GDP?

890
01:27:49,792 --> 01:27:52,292
No, Ms. Struck, I feel really sick.

891
01:27:54,250 --> 01:27:55,667
Really, I mean...

892
01:27:56,917 --> 01:28:00,792
-No joke, I have to... Can I please...
-Yes, fine. Go on.

893
01:28:04,917 --> 01:28:07,375
Don't get daunted by all the terms.

894
01:28:07,667 --> 01:28:11,292
Malate, fumarate, succinate.
You needn't memorize them.

895
01:28:11,583 --> 01:28:12,833
You just...

896
01:28:18,167 --> 01:28:19,875
-What's up?
-Pregnant, maybe.

897
01:28:20,208 --> 01:28:22,042
-Pregnancy test.
-What?

898
01:28:22,917 --> 01:28:24,750
Who by?

899
01:28:25,208 --> 01:28:27,458
Screw the test! Who's the dad?

900
01:28:29,125 --> 01:28:30,667
Who is it?

901
01:28:33,083 --> 01:28:36,417
Look me in the eyes
and tell me it's not who I think.

902
01:28:36,708 --> 01:28:38,125
Look me in the eyes!

903
01:28:48,042 --> 01:28:49,458
Oh no.

904
01:28:50,083 --> 01:28:52,750
Can someone give me some toilet paper?

905
01:28:53,292 --> 01:28:56,667
Yo mama, toilet paper.
You slept with your cousin!

906
01:28:56,958 --> 01:28:58,667
That's disgusting!

907
01:28:59,208 --> 01:29:01,833
-And stop bawling!
-Anna-Lena!

908
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:06,833
Stop! Struck or the janitor will show up
and take you to the principal.

909
01:29:07,917 --> 01:29:09,333
-Clock her.
-What?

910
01:29:09,625 --> 01:29:11,250
Like you did to me.

911
01:29:12,333 --> 01:29:14,417
What's going on here?

912
01:29:26,125 --> 01:29:29,000
-Clean yourself up.
-What am I going to do now?

913
01:29:30,125 --> 01:29:33,167
All right, first you have to see a doctor.

914
01:29:35,542 --> 01:29:36,958
Hold on.

915
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:41,792
-She has to talk to her parents.
-No. Confidentiality.

916
01:29:42,083 --> 01:29:43,917
There's no confidentiality.

917
01:29:44,208 --> 01:29:47,125
If you're under 16,
your parents have to sign.

918
01:29:47,417 --> 01:29:49,792
Why am I the only one who knows that?

919
01:29:50,708 --> 01:29:53,792
Anyone can get laid,
but why can't you use rubbers?

920
01:29:54,083 --> 01:29:55,458
Why?

921
01:29:55,750 --> 01:30:00,417
I'll never sleep with anyone
without a rubber again. I swore to that.

922
01:30:00,708 --> 01:30:03,417
And I'll get a library card next week.

923
01:30:03,708 --> 01:30:08,375
I'll get a book every week till I know
something better than Jameelah.

924
01:30:11,250 --> 01:30:14,333
Jameelah,
I just telephoned with your mother.

925
01:30:14,625 --> 01:30:16,333
She's expecting you.

926
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:23,250
Here, money for a taxi.

927
01:30:25,583 --> 01:30:27,167
Off you go.

928
01:30:27,625 --> 01:30:29,833
-Thanks.
-Thanks, Ms. Struck.

929
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:36,125
Gently now. Now breathe deeply.

930
01:30:46,167 --> 01:30:49,000
Can you please tell me
why we're doing this?

931
01:30:50,083 --> 01:30:52,000
Why are we helping her?

932
01:30:52,542 --> 01:30:56,708
-Because of Lukas or what?
-Stop. I don't want to talk about Lukas.

933
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,792
I don't even want to think of him
or I'll have to kill myself.

934
01:31:02,125 --> 01:31:05,083
He's such an asshole. Totally retarded.

935
01:31:06,917 --> 01:31:08,500
What do you know?

936
01:31:08,792 --> 01:31:11,167
You always say what everyone else says.

937
01:31:11,458 --> 01:31:13,375
You mean he's fantastic?

938
01:31:13,667 --> 01:31:15,750
You have no clue what love is.

939
01:31:16,750 --> 01:31:19,042
-But you do, right?
-Yeah.

940
01:31:20,583 --> 01:31:24,000
If you really love someone
you can't change that.

941
01:31:24,292 --> 01:31:26,292
No matter how crappy he acts.

942
01:31:29,583 --> 01:31:31,083
Sure, but...

943
01:31:31,750 --> 01:31:34,792
You can't love someone
who hurts you so badly.

944
01:31:35,083 --> 01:31:37,208
He doesn't deserve that at all.

945
01:31:37,750 --> 01:31:40,167
Of course I can. You can see that.

946
01:31:41,333 --> 01:31:45,083
And it's nobody's business.
Not yours, not Anna-Lena's.

947
01:31:45,375 --> 01:31:47,458
It's not even Lukas's business.

948
01:31:48,542 --> 01:31:50,417
I can love who I want.

949
01:31:50,708 --> 01:31:54,833
He doesn't even need to love me back.
No one can forbid me to do that.

950
01:31:59,792 --> 01:32:03,583
Jameelah, Nini,
Anna-Lena is with Dr. Mahmoudi now.

951
01:32:03,875 --> 01:32:06,000
Her mother's coming. Come along.

952
01:32:08,042 --> 01:32:10,208
You spending the night at our place?

953
01:32:16,917 --> 01:32:18,333
-Hello.
-Salam.

954
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,833
-Where were you?
-Everything's fine, Amir.

955
01:32:22,125 --> 01:32:23,958
Struck called a few times.

956
01:32:24,250 --> 01:32:25,792
-Have you eaten?
-Uh-uh.

957
01:32:26,083 --> 01:32:28,833
I'll fix something.
Don't eat much, I'll cook.

958
01:32:29,792 --> 01:32:32,042
-Where were you?
-Doesn't matter.

959
01:32:33,125 --> 01:32:35,833
-Have you two made up again?
-I think so.

960
01:32:36,458 --> 01:32:38,458
Then who cares where you were.

961
01:32:38,750 --> 01:32:40,750
-You got a letter.
-Mom, a letter.

962
01:32:41,583 --> 01:32:43,833
From the immigration office.

963
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:46,542
-Where?
-There.

964
01:33:00,667 --> 01:33:02,083
Mom...

965
01:33:03,333 --> 01:33:05,667
-What is it?
-Yeah, what is it?

966
01:33:31,708 --> 01:33:33,792
-Hello, Mr. Kopps-Kruger.
-Yes?

967
01:33:34,083 --> 01:33:37,000
Can we ask you something?
You have to help us.

968
01:33:39,792 --> 01:33:42,042
"Revocation for due cause."

969
01:33:43,167 --> 01:33:46,375
Mom was in Iraq just once
since we've been in Germany.

970
01:33:46,667 --> 01:33:50,208
To go to her mother's funeral,
but she didn't get approval.

971
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:53,833
-They found out.
-But that doesn't matter, right?

972
01:33:57,417 --> 01:33:59,667
No, it does matter. She lied.

973
01:34:00,958 --> 01:34:03,208
Oh man, I could've changed this.

974
01:34:03,875 --> 01:34:08,625
Why didn't you submit a formal response?
Why didn't you go to the hearing?

975
01:34:10,083 --> 01:34:12,875
It says that after receiving notification

976
01:34:13,167 --> 01:34:16,125
we'd have had four weeks to file appeals.

977
01:34:18,958 --> 01:34:20,875
There must be some way.

978
01:34:23,042 --> 01:34:24,875
It's too late now.

979
01:34:31,083 --> 01:34:33,167
Why didn't you come earlier?

980
01:34:33,458 --> 01:34:35,333
I was here the whole summer.

981
01:34:47,542 --> 01:34:49,333
I'm sorry about this.

982
01:35:10,875 --> 01:35:12,458
I'm not a German.

983
01:35:12,750 --> 01:35:15,583
I'll never be a German,
no matter how hard I try.

984
01:35:15,875 --> 01:35:17,958
-Screw Germany.
-Oh stop.

985
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:21,875
-There are lots of good things in Germany.
-Like what?

986
01:35:22,167 --> 01:35:23,542
Don't know.

987
01:35:23,833 --> 01:35:25,625
All kinds of things.

988
01:35:27,958 --> 01:35:32,083
That there's water outside the shops
for dogs in the summer.

989
01:35:48,458 --> 01:35:52,250
Do you know what time it is?
I told you not to be out so late!

990
01:35:52,542 --> 01:35:55,375
-It's only eight.
-S0? After what happened!

991
01:35:55,667 --> 01:35:59,333
-Home at dusk. That was the deal.
-We worry about you.

992
01:36:08,958 --> 01:36:12,000
A package arrived for you.
I put it on your bed.

993
01:36:29,125 --> 01:36:32,417
Hi, Nini,
So you can always reach me, Daddy.

994
01:36:41,833 --> 01:36:42,958
Nini.

995
01:36:44,208 --> 01:36:47,000
-What?
-I was just going to the toilet.

996
01:36:47,292 --> 01:36:48,833
Then it happened.

997
01:36:50,750 --> 01:36:53,333
Come here, it's no big deal. You in pain?

998
01:36:54,667 --> 01:36:56,208
Rainer can't know.

999
01:36:56,500 --> 01:37:00,375
He said when I get my period
I get a white sweater and tomato soup.

1000
01:37:00,958 --> 01:37:04,333
It's what they do where he's from.
I don't want that.

1001
01:37:05,083 --> 01:37:07,750
-I'm scared.
-You don't need to be.

1002
01:37:08,667 --> 01:37:11,542
Pepi says you can go into shock and die.

1003
01:37:12,167 --> 01:37:14,333
It says that in the instructions.

1004
01:37:15,250 --> 01:37:18,875
You won't get toxic shock syndrome.
Just put it in.

1005
01:37:19,208 --> 01:37:21,292
-You sure?
-Absolutely sure.

1006
01:37:21,875 --> 01:37:23,958
I'll pay close attention, okay?

1007
01:37:30,333 --> 01:37:32,833
It is super easy.
You don't feel it at all.

1008
01:37:34,917 --> 01:37:37,250
You sleep in my room tonight, okay?

1009
01:37:38,833 --> 01:37:41,250
-Can I have something sweet?
-Sure.

1010
01:39:00,292 --> 01:39:01,708
Get out.

1011
01:39:04,917 --> 01:39:06,583
Come out please.

1012
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,333
Jameelah!

1013
01:39:36,792 --> 01:39:38,542
-Nini! Nini! Nini!
-Stop!

1014
01:40:15,833 --> 01:40:17,708
-Pinkie promise.
-Pinkie promise.

1015
01:40:20,292 --> 01:40:23,125
I'll get some con working the night shit.

1016
01:40:23,417 --> 01:40:25,250
I'll come visit you, okay?

1017
01:40:25,583 --> 01:40:27,208
I swear to it!

1018
01:40:27,750 --> 01:40:29,583
Get a red-eye to Baghdad.
