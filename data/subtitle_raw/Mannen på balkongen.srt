1
00:01:17,815 --> 00:01:21,569
As we enter the next room,

2
00:01:28,295 --> 00:01:34,768
this is the main observatory, the old observation room.

3
00:01:34,855 --> 00:01:39,724
Where the inventor looked at
the planets and stars.

4
00:01:39,815 --> 00:01:44,286
His name was Pehr Wilhelm Wargentin...

5
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:47,811
and he was known throughout the world.

6
00:01:47,895 --> 00:01:54,209
Why are you staying up here?
I left the door open for you.

7
00:01:54,295 --> 00:02:01,485
So we built and publicized
it. Now we'll enter the next room.

8
00:02:51,015 --> 00:02:56,009
Radio Echo. The time is 5:45.
Miloslav Dragan still at large.

9
00:02:56,095 --> 00:03:03,251
Poor business growth
in Stockholm.

10
00:03:03,335 --> 00:03:07,965
No progress in lease negotiations.

11
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:13,891
The fugitive Miloslav Dragan is still
at large after escaping a week ago.

12
00:03:13,975 --> 00:03:17,968
Police said he could
have made his way to Stockholm.

13
00:03:18,055 --> 00:03:23,209
The guard at Anstalten Hall Prison
who was shot in the escape

14
00:03:23,295 --> 00:03:27,891
is being treated
at the Karolinska Hospital.

15
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:31,968
His condition is serious
but stable.

16
00:03:32,055 --> 00:03:37,766
According C.I.D. Commissioner Stig Åke Malm,
Dragan is heavily armed.

17
00:03:39,455 --> 00:03:42,970
Larsson here. Hi.

18
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:47,970
No, not at all. How so?

19
00:03:48,055 --> 00:03:52,253
Yes, it was a week ago.

20
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:59,890
Here are some addresses to begin with:

21
00:03:59,975 --> 00:04:03,365
Slavo Slav Mística, Andrei Korda...

22
00:04:03,455 --> 00:04:10,054
Dragan won't be hiding at the first place we'd check.

23
00:04:10,135 --> 00:04:14,094
We have to start somewhere.

24
00:04:14,175 --> 00:04:21,809
Can't the fucking Yugoslavs be content
to kill each other at home?

25
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,843
Slavo Slav...

26
00:04:27,295 --> 00:04:32,369
Hi. The situation isn't good at all with Dragan.

27
00:04:32,455 --> 00:04:38,803
A telephone call, Gunvald. The Chief.
- Malm? Stig-Åke? What fun.

28
00:04:38,895 --> 00:04:45,607
- It'll be nice to talk to the big cheese.
- I'll go now.

29
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:50,094
Putte?

30
00:06:19,495 --> 00:06:22,612
Dad?

31
00:07:23,175 --> 00:07:28,203
What do you want?
- A Magnum ice cream bar.

32
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:42,251
When I was little I thought
that all the guys were like you.

33
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:47,648
A little boring, but okay.

34
00:07:48,815 --> 00:07:54,412
Hopeless in a sense,
but at least reliable.

35
00:07:54,495 --> 00:07:59,774
Kalle isn't at all like that.
He's good looking...

36
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:04,975
Sorry, Dad.
You're also pretty gorgeous in your way.

37
00:08:05,055 --> 00:08:12,484
He's completely unreliable, damn it.
It doesn't make any sense, like...

38
00:08:16,015 --> 00:08:20,531
we were at a party on Walpurgis Night.

39
00:08:20,615 --> 00:08:26,326
It was there that he met Anne.
Anne, the bitch.

40
00:08:26,415 --> 00:08:31,443
He didn't say anything to me,
and I don't give a shit.

41
00:08:31,535 --> 00:08:37,644
He saw her for a full month
without telling me a thing.

42
00:08:40,015 --> 00:08:44,213
He was certainly never
going to say anything.

43
00:08:44,295 --> 00:08:48,334
Why does it have to happen like this?

44
00:08:51,095 --> 00:08:56,488
We had stopped smoking and everything.
- Yes, but that's good, that's good.

45
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:03,174
I might as well start again now.
- But please Putte...

46
00:09:03,255 --> 00:09:06,770
Well then.

47
00:09:08,175 --> 00:09:16,492
I'll smoke myself to death.
- But what is this nonsense? Putte...

48
00:09:48,295 --> 00:09:51,890
No! Let go!

49
00:09:51,975 --> 00:09:55,206
Stop it!

50
00:09:56,215 --> 00:10:00,845
No! Please, no...

51
00:11:48,135 --> 00:11:54,244
God, I'm so late!
Do you mind if I shower before you?

52
00:12:00,535 --> 00:12:05,404
Yes, it's Beck. Vanadislunden Park?

53
00:12:15,215 --> 00:12:20,653
How can this kind of thing happen?
How can you let that happen?!

54
00:12:20,735 --> 00:12:26,651
We have to able to go home!
My grandmother won't go out

55
00:12:26,735 --> 00:12:34,050
because she's afraid. I'm at the day care centre
and responsible for 30 children!

56
00:12:34,135 --> 00:12:40,654
People steal from anywhere! Someone stole
the children's clothes from the laundry room.

57
00:12:40,735 --> 00:12:44,808
How can such a thing happen?!

58
00:12:46,095 --> 00:12:52,170
The rain has probably ruined everything.
- Strangled, perhaps some form of rape.

59
00:12:52,255 --> 00:12:55,611
Panties missing.

60
00:12:55,695 --> 00:13:02,043
It happened sometime last night.
- Check out what she ate and when.

61
00:13:09,535 --> 00:13:15,531
Is it a sex murder?
- It can't be ruled out in any case.

62
00:13:18,335 --> 00:13:25,093
Did it happen here? -Forensics say
that everything points in that direction.

63
00:13:25,175 --> 00:13:30,568
How are things going?
- The rain...

64
00:13:30,655 --> 00:13:34,807
If you find a few footsteps,
they're probably mine.

65
00:13:34,895 --> 00:13:39,605
I was here last night at nine o'clock.

66
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:45,930
There was a robbery here. The lady at the kiosk
was attacked 50 feet away.

67
00:13:46,015 --> 00:13:51,453
She had all the takings in her bag.
- The girl must have been there then.

68
00:13:51,535 --> 00:13:57,246
Probably. A patrol came by
a half an hour before the robbery.

69
00:13:57,335 --> 00:14:04,207
Of course they saw nothing.
Could it be the same guy?

70
00:14:04,295 --> 00:14:10,052
No, she was raped
It's probably not the same person.

71
00:14:10,135 --> 00:14:15,448
In any case, the doctor hasn't ruled out the possibility.
- Damn...

72
00:14:15,535 --> 00:14:21,974
Two crazy people in the same place at the same time,
one worse than the other.

73
00:14:22,055 --> 00:14:25,730
What a fucking job!

74
00:14:42,975 --> 00:14:49,130
What happened to the woman from the kiosk?
- Cerebral haemorrhage, broken cheekbone...

75
00:14:49,215 --> 00:14:52,924
and a broken nose.

76
00:14:53,015 --> 00:14:59,329
Granlund identified the girl from
a photo the mother filed yesterday.

77
00:14:59,415 --> 00:15:07,254
Karin Svensson. Kollberg has gone
to visit her parents in Frejgatan.

78
00:15:45,295 --> 00:15:50,892
Lennart Kollberg, CID.
- Have you found her?

79
00:15:50,975 --> 00:15:54,684
Can we go in?

80
00:16:05,815 --> 00:16:11,572
Can we sit down?
- Yes.

81
00:16:17,055 --> 00:16:22,004
What happened? Have you found her?

82
00:16:22,095 --> 00:16:24,563
We...

83
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:34,453
Would you please sit down?

84
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:41,891
Where's your husband?
- I don't have a husband. We're separated.

85
00:16:49,615 --> 00:16:55,770
I... I'm terribly sorry
to have to tell you this...

86
00:16:55,855 --> 00:16:59,564
Your daughter is dead.

87
00:17:00,735 --> 00:17:07,846
But we're going to the country.
It isn't Karin. You're wrong!

88
00:17:07,935 --> 00:17:12,292
It isn't Karin! It isn't Karin!

89
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:27,093
It isn't Karin!

90
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:52,291
How did it go?
- Life's a bitch.

91
00:17:55,375 --> 00:18:02,406
Having to try to comfort and calm...

92
00:18:02,495 --> 00:18:05,851
and at the same time...

93
00:18:05,935 --> 00:18:12,010
If this had happened to you,
you'd have committed suicide.

94
00:18:13,735 --> 00:18:18,445
Say something, damn it.
- What can I say?

95
00:18:18,535 --> 00:18:23,928
Anway, it changes nothing.
- What should I do then?

96
00:18:24,015 --> 00:18:30,011
You have to get used to it.
You... Let's walk.

97
00:19:00,575 --> 00:19:05,888
Let's begin with the next of kin.
We can rule out the father.

98
00:19:05,975 --> 00:19:12,005
He's out of reach. A sailor.
- Where the hell is Kracke?

99
00:19:12,095 --> 00:19:18,568
Did any other people know the girl?
- No, we don't know yet.

100
00:19:24,655 --> 00:19:28,568
Hello. Gunvald's looking for you.

101
00:19:28,655 --> 00:19:35,845
It's about Dragan.
- Gunvald wants more coffee, Skacke.

102
00:19:35,935 --> 00:19:42,010
Good that you came. Karin Svensson's mother
reported a flasher to the police last year.

103
00:19:42,095 --> 00:19:47,328
Karl Erik Einar Ingmarsson. Here's an
interview we conducted with the girl then.

104
00:19:47,415 --> 00:19:54,924
Assistant Detective Bergström.
- Karin, what did the man do?

105
00:19:55,015 --> 00:20:01,614
He smelled nasty,
but somehow he seemed nice.

106
00:20:01,695 --> 00:20:08,089
He asked us to go home with him.
- Why do you think he wanted that?

107
00:20:08,175 --> 00:20:13,886
I don't know. He seemed strange.
- In what way?

108
00:20:13,975 --> 00:20:19,607
He had weird clothes
and talked a little weird.

109
00:20:19,695 --> 00:20:24,007
Did you agree to go with him?
- No.

110
00:20:24,095 --> 00:20:30,091
What did he do?
- He talked to us several times.

111
00:20:30,175 --> 00:20:38,810
What happened then?
- He left and we slipped away.

112
00:20:38,895 --> 00:20:45,243
Did you tell your mother?
- No. I don't really know why.

113
00:20:45,335 --> 00:20:50,887
Did you tell her what happened yesterday?
- Yes.

114
00:20:50,975 --> 00:20:55,526
Was it the same man?
- Yes.

115
00:20:55,615 --> 00:20:59,574
He said he'd give us money if we went with him.

116
00:20:59,655 --> 00:21:07,084
But you didn't follow him?
- No. Mama had warned me about this kind of thing.

117
00:21:07,175 --> 00:21:10,531
That's good.

118
00:21:12,615 --> 00:21:18,406
What else do we have?
- We're working on tips from the public.

119
00:21:18,495 --> 00:21:24,684
We've interrogated the guys we already know.

120
00:21:24,775 --> 00:21:28,848
Do you want to talk to Ingmarsson?
- No thanks.

121
00:21:28,935 --> 00:21:32,484
This report is the preliminary autopsy.

122
00:21:32,575 --> 00:21:37,854
Strangulation, finger marks on her neck,
no skin scrapings under her nails.

123
00:21:37,935 --> 00:21:43,453
A few bruises on the arms and hands,
more around the genitals

124
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:51,010
caused first by heavy blows and then by punches.

125
00:21:51,095 --> 00:21:54,405
No outright rape.

126
00:21:54,495 --> 00:21:58,807
Panties are believed missing.

127
00:21:58,895 --> 00:22:05,368
They were white knit,
size 1.40, a common brand.

128
00:22:08,015 --> 00:22:14,853
The mugger that Gunvald interviewed,
that skinhead. He could be a witness.

129
00:22:14,935 --> 00:22:22,410
Perhaps he cased the location before the robbery.
The lady at the kiosk could also be a witness.

130
00:22:22,495 --> 00:22:27,774
Unless the mugger and the murderer
are the same person.

131
00:22:27,855 --> 00:22:30,972
That's unlikely.

132
00:22:31,055 --> 00:22:38,370
The kiosk lady saw the mugger.
The mugger saw the killer...

133
00:22:45,895 --> 00:22:50,923
Coffee?
- No thanks.

134
00:22:52,095 --> 00:22:58,011
I was sitting at the Pelican
until they closed.

135
00:22:58,095 --> 00:23:02,486
You can ask the guys.

136
00:23:05,495 --> 00:23:12,606
I'd never kill a human being.

137
00:23:12,695 --> 00:23:18,884
I've told you.
I was at the Pelican all evening.

138
00:23:18,975 --> 00:23:25,414
Okay, Ingmarsson. Go home.

139
00:24:10,095 --> 00:24:15,453
I fell asleep.
- Hi.

140
00:24:17,695 --> 00:24:21,290
Soon.

141
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:25,334
He's kicking.

142
00:24:30,975 --> 00:24:34,809
How's it going?

143
00:26:07,215 --> 00:26:09,934
Annika?

144
00:27:00,855 --> 00:27:04,768
Stop! Wait!

145
00:27:09,455 --> 00:27:15,371
Yes, that's about all.
The time now is 13:45

146
00:27:20,535 --> 00:27:26,690
How long ago did it happen?
-20 minutes. The body temperature is 35º.

147
00:27:26,775 --> 00:27:31,371
Less than an hour ago then.

148
00:27:53,455 --> 00:28:00,372
One of the dogs followed a track to
Gyllenstiernsgatan. But it lost the scent.

149
00:28:00,455 --> 00:28:05,245
Has anyone talked to the parents?
- Yes, we don't have it.

150
00:28:05,335 --> 00:28:11,331
I want to meet the boys who found her.
Lennart...

151
00:28:14,415 --> 00:28:18,886
He's going to do it again.

152
00:28:21,255 --> 00:28:24,964
According to the boys who found Annika,

153
00:28:25,055 --> 00:28:30,846
she had been playing with your daughter Lena
earlier today.

154
00:28:30,935 --> 00:28:36,646
She knows what's happened?
- Yes. How can anyone...

155
00:28:36,735 --> 00:28:40,489
I'll get her.

156
00:28:45,815 --> 00:28:51,128
Toot, toot! Hello. I've got a car.

157
00:28:51,215 --> 00:28:55,413
I've got a taxi.

158
00:28:55,495 --> 00:29:00,364
Can you drive it then?
- Toot, toot.

159
00:29:00,455 --> 00:29:06,246
Is there a button?
- Are you sick too? Toot.

160
00:29:09,655 --> 00:29:14,092
Brmm, brmm.

161
00:29:18,895 --> 00:29:24,891
I think that Lena and I should talk alone.

162
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:29,650
Shall we sit down?

163
00:29:33,095 --> 00:29:38,931
My name is Martin. I know that you've
been through something terrible today,

164
00:29:39,015 --> 00:29:45,090
but I'd like to ask you
a few things anyway.

165
00:29:45,175 --> 00:29:49,453
You were with Annika today.

166
00:29:49,535 --> 00:29:57,215
After school we picked up Bosse
from kindergarten, and then we played outside.

167
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:04,087
- Bosse? Who's that?
That's my little brother.

168
00:30:04,175 --> 00:30:11,889
Do you know what time it was?
- About four.

169
00:30:12,935 --> 00:30:19,488
Did you see anybody else in the park
or did Annika talk to an adult?

170
00:30:20,815 --> 00:30:25,252
No. She got angry at us and ran away.

171
00:30:26,255 --> 00:30:31,852
She ran away?
- Yes.

172
00:30:31,935 --> 00:30:39,888
She ran away alone?
- Bosse followed her behind the church.

173
00:30:39,975 --> 00:30:44,969
Then did she come back?
- Just Bosse.

174
00:30:45,055 --> 00:30:49,094
Not... Annika.

175
00:31:09,175 --> 00:31:17,571
If he kills again it will be in the inner city,
so I've marked out all the parks.

176
00:31:17,655 --> 00:31:24,288
I've noted down the telephone number.
We'll let you know if there's anything more.

177
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:27,128
Thank you.

178
00:31:27,215 --> 00:31:32,164
How did it go?
- Well we've got two witnesses now.

179
00:31:32,255 --> 00:31:38,933
Both the mugger and Bosse Oskarsson.
He's three years old.

180
00:31:39,015 --> 00:31:43,884
A known mugger and a three year old...
Brilliant.

181
00:31:43,975 --> 00:31:47,854
What the hell is Gunvald doing?

182
00:31:47,935 --> 00:31:54,374
The getaway car was a Peugeot, white, '79 model.

183
00:31:54,455 --> 00:32:00,724
A mugger. In Vanadislunden.
- Wait a minute. What is it?

184
00:32:00,815 --> 00:32:06,287
Get him!
- I'll call you back.

185
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:11,051
What do you think I've been doing?

186
00:32:11,135 --> 00:32:17,654
We have to find Dragan. He's dangerous.
He's already shot someone.

187
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:23,571
Your amateur kiosk mugger can fucking well wait.
- Not any more.

188
00:32:23,655 --> 00:32:31,414
Now you've got to get him.
- Fine. Give me 3,000 kronor for extra staff.

189
00:32:31,495 --> 00:32:36,046
- When was the Vanadislunden robbery committed?
- Between 7:45 and 8:00.

190
00:32:36,135 --> 00:32:41,926
- And a killing between 7:00 and 8:00?
- Yes. But we already knew that.

191
00:32:42,015 --> 00:32:48,932
I'm trying to convince myself
that the mugger might have seen the girl...

192
00:32:49,015 --> 00:32:54,135
and perhaps also her killer.
Are you with us?

193
00:32:54,215 --> 00:32:58,652
- Get him.
Use your stool pigeon.

194
00:32:58,735 --> 00:33:05,891
Either he's in the Canary Islands
or in a crack house somewhere in Söderby.

195
00:33:05,975 --> 00:33:09,570
Use all your underworld contacts.

196
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:16,128
Use television, radio, whatever the hell you want.
But get that guy.

197
00:33:16,215 --> 00:33:22,563
Do you think I don't understand?
- Bravo, Gunvald.

198
00:33:49,735 --> 00:33:56,174
Martin... I was at the university
and saw this course catalogue.

199
00:34:02,895 --> 00:34:08,811
I recognized the name Susanne Grassman.
I've read some of her articles.

200
00:34:08,895 --> 00:34:12,649
It might be something.

201
00:34:15,735 --> 00:34:23,415
What the hell are we doing?
I don't know. But we'd better damn well hurry up.

202
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:27,249
Grassman...

203
00:35:12,975 --> 00:35:19,608
All this is due to the ridiculous sentences.
There should be public lynchings.

204
00:35:19,695 --> 00:35:24,974
Murdering and raping little girls...

205
00:35:25,055 --> 00:35:32,609
There's got to be a limit. There should be
public executions... shown on TV.

206
00:35:32,695 --> 00:35:39,612
It's a bitch. You can't help wonder
what the police are doing.

207
00:35:43,735 --> 00:35:49,844
When were you planning to be chief of police?
- I borrowed it.

208
00:35:53,535 --> 00:35:59,451
Could we have a coffee or something?
- Is this where you learn about life?

209
00:35:59,535 --> 00:36:03,244
At the library... or on Surbrunnsgatan?

210
00:36:39,575 --> 00:36:47,050
You don't normally read the newspaper.
- There's nothing in it.

211
00:36:47,135 --> 00:36:52,812
Give it to me, then.
- Let me just browse a bit.

212
00:36:52,895 --> 00:36:56,934
Take the supplement.

213
00:36:57,015 --> 00:37:04,330
You're cops, huh?
I recognize you.

214
00:37:04,415 --> 00:37:10,012
Yeah. And to what do owe the honour?

215
00:37:14,095 --> 00:37:17,212
Dragan.

216
00:37:17,295 --> 00:37:23,564
You're looking for him, the fucking asshole.
I know where he is.

217
00:37:23,655 --> 00:37:27,364
There's no reward.

218
00:37:27,455 --> 00:37:31,528
I don't care about money.
I probably earn more than you.

219
00:37:31,615 --> 00:37:36,609
Yes, in the pussy.
- One more word like that and I'm going.

220
00:37:36,695 --> 00:37:43,487
Sit down.
- It's a free country isn't it?

221
00:37:43,575 --> 00:37:47,329
Please, sit down.

222
00:37:50,615 --> 00:37:56,451
Do you know where Dragan is?
- Yes. Next door.

223
00:37:56,535 --> 00:38:01,211
69 Luntmakargatan
- Is he there now?

224
00:38:01,295 --> 00:38:03,809
Yes.

225
00:38:03,895 --> 00:38:09,606
What does it say on the door?
- My name. Simonsson.

226
00:38:09,695 --> 00:38:16,931
- How many stairs?
- One. There's a second one to the kitchenette.

227
00:38:17,015 --> 00:38:20,530
How many windows?
- Three.

228
00:38:20,615 --> 00:38:25,530
Do they look on to the park?
- No, it's a lake view.

229
00:38:25,615 --> 00:38:31,133
Is he alone?
- No.

230
00:38:44,535 --> 00:38:52,488
We're on the rise in park.
- Roger. Notify me when you're on site.

231
00:38:52,575 --> 00:38:57,490
Come in Wiktorin.
What about the stair well?

232
00:38:57,575 --> 00:39:01,363
Soon. Give us five minutes.

233
00:39:01,455 --> 00:39:05,004
Two helicopters will be here soon.

234
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:11,493
How fucking good is that to pull
the helicopters in? It's pure Gulf War.

235
00:39:11,575 --> 00:39:15,488
You mean that I shouldn't have called?

236
00:39:16,495 --> 00:39:24,288
I know it's difficult, but we'll try
again. Try to remember what he looked like.

237
00:39:32,215 --> 00:39:36,572
Dragan? Was it him?

238
00:39:40,575 --> 00:39:47,048
- Attention. Three minutes to go.
- Wiktorin here. Understood.

239
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:51,686
Johansson here. Understood.
- Bergelin. Understood.

240
00:40:05,455 --> 00:40:08,447
Yes, it's blocked.

241
00:40:08,535 --> 00:40:14,610
Is Malm somewhere here?
- Up on the roof.

242
00:40:31,575 --> 00:40:34,726
Wait!

243
00:40:38,535 --> 00:40:45,532
I have to talk to him!
- He's taken a woman hostage!

244
00:40:45,615 --> 00:40:52,248
He's probably our only witness
to the Vanadislunden murder!

245
00:40:52,335 --> 00:40:57,853
Unthinkable! No suicide operations!
- Listen to me!

246
00:40:57,935 --> 00:41:02,167
Dragan is a witness.
He's probably our only chance

247
00:41:02,255 --> 00:41:05,531
to identify the girl's killer.

248
00:41:11,455 --> 00:41:15,004
Look at that.

249
00:41:15,095 --> 00:41:18,929
Get it? Let us handle it.

250
00:41:21,815 --> 00:41:27,128
Stig-Åke, we need him alive.

251
00:41:27,215 --> 00:41:31,811
Not shot to pieces by a whole army of police.

252
00:41:31,895 --> 00:41:35,808
Let me try!

253
00:41:38,215 --> 00:41:41,571
We'll wait.

254
00:41:42,775 --> 00:41:46,768
We're waiting.

255
00:41:47,895 --> 00:41:53,686
We're calling it off.
I repeat. We're calling it off.

256
00:41:57,455 --> 00:42:03,769
What the hell are we doing to do now?
- Give me ten minutes.

257
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:08,804
I'll go in and talk to him.
What are you going to do? Ring the doorbell?

258
00:42:08,895 --> 00:42:14,527
No. We have the key.

259
00:42:35,815 --> 00:42:39,364
We're going in now.

260
00:42:39,455 --> 00:42:45,485
You had the key?
- Yes. But it's my house key.

261
00:43:20,095 --> 00:43:26,409
Put on your clothes … if you have any.
- And you.

262
00:43:28,215 --> 00:43:32,527
Who are you?
- Lisbeth Karlström.

263
00:43:32,615 --> 00:43:37,450
We're from the police. How long
have you known this man?

264
00:43:37,535 --> 00:43:43,929
Two hours and twenty minutes.
I met him in the park.

265
00:43:44,015 --> 00:43:48,531
Not much to show for the ladies.

266
00:43:48,615 --> 00:43:55,453
What's he done?
- Sex maniac.

267
00:44:09,775 --> 00:44:14,246
- What's happening?
- Don't ask me.

268
00:44:14,335 --> 00:44:18,044
Call Beck.

269
00:44:20,255 --> 00:44:22,644
Martin Beck, come in.

270
00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:26,935
Beck, come in.

271
00:44:28,055 --> 00:44:31,092
Beck, come in.

272
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:35,844
Martin Beck, come in.

273
00:44:37,455 --> 00:44:41,130
He doesn't answer.

274
00:44:42,255 --> 00:44:46,646
Actually they have two more minutes.

275
00:44:46,735 --> 00:44:50,091
We're going in now.

276
00:44:51,735 --> 00:44:53,771
Wiktorin. Come in.

277
00:45:10,135 --> 00:45:14,253
Malm, dammit!

278
00:45:23,575 --> 00:45:27,807
Attention! Drop your weapon!

279
00:45:31,215 --> 00:45:37,654
Attention!
Come out with your hands over your head!

280
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:44,368
Stop Malm or there'll be a bloodbath.
We'll storm the apartment!

281
00:45:44,455 --> 00:45:48,130
I repeat. We're going to storm the apartment!

282
00:46:02,735 --> 00:46:04,612
Stop!

283
00:46:51,815 --> 00:46:57,890
Yes, shall we talk a little then?

284
00:46:58,895 --> 00:47:04,527
Not you and me.
- What?

285
00:47:04,615 --> 00:47:11,293
Not with you.
I don't want to talk to you.

286
00:47:11,375 --> 00:47:17,530
Well then. Who do you want to talk to?

287
00:47:17,615 --> 00:47:23,133
With the guy who took me. The tall one.

288
00:47:24,135 --> 00:47:28,048
Fetch Gunvald.

289
00:47:31,175 --> 00:47:33,609
Gunvald!

290
00:47:35,375 --> 00:47:39,209
He wants to talk to you.

291
00:47:45,455 --> 00:47:49,494
Dragan wants to talk to you.

292
00:47:54,575 --> 00:47:57,533
Yeah?

293
00:47:58,895 --> 00:48:04,413
You were the one who took me.
- So what?

294
00:48:04,495 --> 00:48:10,934
It's nothing I'm proud of.
Arresting you was my job.

295
00:48:11,015 --> 00:48:14,849
In a week I'll have forgotten all about you.

296
00:48:14,935 --> 00:48:22,967
There are some details we want to go over
before we deal with your offence.

297
00:48:23,055 --> 00:48:30,564
We know you were in Vanadislunden
Friday evening last week.

298
00:48:34,335 --> 00:48:39,045
Yeah.
- Where you violently assaulted a woman at 8:00,

299
00:48:39,135 --> 00:48:44,493
the kiosk owner, Hildur Magnusson.

300
00:48:46,975 --> 00:48:51,526
What time did you get to the park?
- Shut up!

301
00:48:51,615 --> 00:48:54,971
Be bloody careful how you speak.

302
00:48:56,255 --> 00:49:01,329
Hildur Magnusson is in a coma.

303
00:49:01,415 --> 00:49:07,934
Cerebral haemorrhage, broken jaw,
four teeth broken, broken nose.

304
00:49:08,015 --> 00:49:14,284
How much money you bring in?
1,500? Or even 2,000?

305
00:49:14,375 --> 00:49:18,414
Why didn't she let go of her bag, huh?

306
00:49:18,495 --> 00:49:23,489
A murder was committed
while you were in the park.

307
00:49:23,575 --> 00:49:29,810
Heard of it?
- I read about it.

308
00:49:29,895 --> 00:49:36,528
- And?
- It wasn't me. I swear!

309
00:49:38,775 --> 00:49:43,291
Did you see that girl?

310
00:49:48,095 --> 00:49:51,485
Did you see her?!

311
00:49:51,575 --> 00:49:57,013
I think so.
- Where?

312
00:49:57,095 --> 00:50:03,250
In the playground beneath the water tower.
In any case a kid was there.

313
00:50:03,335 --> 00:50:08,614
What was she doing?
- Swinging.

314
00:50:08,695 --> 00:50:13,769
Alone?
- Yes, alone.

315
00:50:16,975 --> 00:50:21,366
I've been thinking about this.

316
00:50:21,455 --> 00:50:27,451
It must have been 7:30.

317
00:50:27,535 --> 00:50:31,289
She left the playground at 7:30

318
00:50:31,375 --> 00:50:35,448
but she wasn't there at 8:00
when you hit Hildur Magnusson?

319
00:50:35,535 --> 00:50:39,210
No.

320
00:50:39,295 --> 00:50:44,733
What did you do
during that half hour?

321
00:50:44,815 --> 00:50:50,651
I was watching to see the people
who were coming from both directions.

322
00:50:51,895 --> 00:50:56,446
Did you see any?
- People were coming and going.

323
00:50:56,535 --> 00:51:02,371
Five or six.
A police car cruised by.

324
00:51:02,455 --> 00:51:08,894
A man went by with a dog.
I followed him for a while.

325
00:51:08,975 --> 00:51:14,891
That was between 7:30 and 7:45.

326
00:51:15,895 --> 00:51:19,888
Was that all?

327
00:51:21,735 --> 00:51:25,250
Was that all?

328
00:51:25,335 --> 00:51:30,568
Now try to remember, dammit.

329
00:51:35,655 --> 00:51:41,207
- Yes... Aah...
- Yes?

330
00:51:43,055 --> 00:51:47,128
I did see another one.

331
00:51:48,975 --> 00:51:54,572
Someone who came from the other direction.

332
00:51:54,655 --> 00:51:57,931
When you did you see him?

333
00:51:58,015 --> 00:52:04,614
Shortly after the...
When the lady was lying on the ground.

334
00:52:10,935 --> 00:52:15,770
Why didn't she let go of her bag?

335
00:52:15,855 --> 00:52:19,609
When you assaulted Hildur Magnusson

336
00:52:19,695 --> 00:52:27,249
you also saw a man coming
from Sveavägen?

337
00:52:29,015 --> 00:52:33,054
And could you see him clearly?

338
00:52:35,935 --> 00:52:38,893
Yes.

339
00:52:50,295 --> 00:52:57,690
He was balding with his hair brushed straight back,
and a not very long nose. Approximately.

340
00:53:02,775 --> 00:53:06,734
That's too big I think.

341
00:53:06,815 --> 00:53:10,569
Was he blonde?
- Yes.

342
00:53:10,655 --> 00:53:16,605
How old would he have have been?
- Between 30 and 35.

343
00:53:16,695 --> 00:53:20,449
Maybe 35.

344
00:53:49,735 --> 00:53:56,368
Hi, Dad. You're late.
We got a pizza for you.

345
00:53:56,455 --> 00:54:00,926
I ate out.
- Then Kalle came here.

346
00:54:01,015 --> 00:54:04,894
He's sleeping here tonight.
That's okay, isn't it?

347
00:54:05,895 --> 00:54:12,812
I thought you had quit smoking.
- That's Kalle. He started again.

348
00:56:08,935 --> 00:56:14,009
This is Dr. Susanne Grassman
from Berlin

349
00:56:14,095 --> 00:56:20,330
Psychiatrist and behavioural scientist
and guest lecturer at the university.

350
00:56:20,415 --> 00:56:28,333
Dr. Grassman has had access
to FBI research reports.

351
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:34,285
We can benefit from her help
in our continuing reconnaissance work.

352
00:57:40,015 --> 00:57:45,453
When you're back at school again
- It's time to start studying.

353
00:58:27,255 --> 00:58:32,648
There might be two different types of
serial killer, but what good is that?

354
00:58:32,735 --> 00:58:38,253
If he strikes again tomorrow, does it
matter what category he belongs to?

355
00:58:38,335 --> 00:58:45,013
You know how to look for him.
- How? Check out all single men?

356
00:58:45,095 --> 00:58:50,408
Damned bullshit.
- Everything new isn't crap.

357
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:54,090
No, but a hell of a lot of it is.

358
00:58:54,175 --> 00:58:59,454
Have we completely ruled out Dragan?
It might be him.

359
00:58:59,535 --> 00:59:06,054
He was on the spot.
He's not the chaotic type.

360
00:59:06,135 --> 00:59:10,572
How do you know?
Have you gone camping with him?

361
00:59:10,655 --> 00:59:13,886
Is it meat or fish?

362
00:59:13,975 --> 00:59:19,288
Shouldn't we check out the girl
who was with Dragan?

363
00:59:47,175 --> 00:59:49,848
Hello?

364
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:18,092
What the hell are you doing here?!
Do you always break into people's houses?

365
01:00:18,175 --> 01:00:24,171
The door was open. I rang the bell.
- Yeah. What do you want?

366
01:00:24,255 --> 01:00:30,933
I'm 25 years old. I'm studying art.
I'm unmarried, free as the air...

367
01:00:31,015 --> 01:00:38,490
On Tuesday, I happened to pick up the
guy. I didn't know who he was.

368
01:00:38,575 --> 01:00:43,933
I didn't know he was Dragan.
- Miloslav Dragan.

369
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:51,126
I don't suspect you of anything.
I just want to ask some questions.

370
01:00:51,215 --> 01:00:55,493
Sorry. Would you like coffee?
- Yes please.

371
01:00:58,415 --> 01:01:05,253
Actually, I want to ask you about
something I think you know quite a lot about.

372
01:01:05,335 --> 01:01:10,932
How was he, Dragan .. sexually?

373
01:01:13,255 --> 01:01:20,411
I usually don't give reviews
about the guys I sleep with.

374
01:01:20,495 --> 01:01:26,206
Dragan probably isn't a violent man.

375
01:01:26,295 --> 01:01:31,767
A week ago on Friday
he was in Vanadislunden...

376
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:38,169
when a ten year girl
was raped and murdered.

377
01:01:40,415 --> 01:01:43,805
I didn't know that.

378
01:01:47,055 --> 01:01:53,210
As far as I can judge, he was
completely normal. Almost too normal.

379
01:01:53,295 --> 01:01:57,652
What do you mean?

380
01:01:57,735 --> 01:02:04,971
When you do it so rarely, you want
a little more than... the routine stuff.

381
01:02:11,175 --> 01:02:16,374
Did he approach you?
- No. Quite the opposite.

382
01:02:16,455 --> 01:02:23,645
I had taken my text books
down to the park. I do that sometimes.

383
01:02:23,735 --> 01:02:30,208
And I saw him there...
nice, really nice.

384
01:02:30,295 --> 01:02:34,049
He wasn't at all abnormal.

385
01:02:34,135 --> 01:02:41,086
At the beginning, he showed no interest.
But I made ​​sure that he did.

386
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:49,724
You certainly take some risks.
- I know.

387
01:02:51,695 --> 01:02:54,687
Stylish.

388
01:02:58,855 --> 01:03:02,484
Goodbye.

389
01:04:57,455 --> 01:05:02,404
We'll begin by knocking on doors
in all three directions.

390
01:05:02,495 --> 01:05:05,851
Claesson and Winzell will take Hagagatan

391
01:05:05,935 --> 01:05:12,010
and Dalagatan as far as Sveavägen,
while Gunartz and Persson will take Rogestam.

392
01:05:12,095 --> 01:05:20,412
The rest of you follow me down to
Roslagsgatan. Let's get started. Quick!

393
01:07:40,895 --> 01:07:45,810
What the hell is this all about?
- Police.

394
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:50,047
Then we apologize.

395
01:07:50,135 --> 01:07:56,483
You were standing in the bushes
and spying on the children.

396
01:07:56,575 --> 01:08:01,968
We're parents and we know
the parents of the girl who...

397
01:08:02,055 --> 01:08:08,654
- We've formed a voluntary defence service.
- A what? What the hell are you saying?!

398
01:08:08,735 --> 01:08:16,733
Don't use that that tone. We're not drunks.
We intend to protect our children.

399
01:08:16,815 --> 01:08:21,286
Do you have a license for this?
- No.

400
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:28,053
I bought it in Seville.
Normally, I keep it locked up.

401
01:08:28,135 --> 01:08:31,571
Fucking bone-heads.

402
01:08:35,615 --> 01:08:43,727
Beck.
- I went to Gustavus Adolphus Park.

403
01:08:43,815 --> 01:08:48,809
I got attacked by a couple of fathers.

404
01:08:48,895 --> 01:08:56,051
They've formed a vigilante band.
Hello?

405
01:08:56,135 --> 01:09:00,492
Is it serious?
- No, my neck's just a bit sore.

406
01:09:00,575 --> 01:09:06,093
A pensioner was attacked in
Haga Park while he was peeing.

407
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:09,087
What should we do?

408
01:09:19,215 --> 01:09:26,291
3802 to 70. Come in.
- 3802.

409
01:09:26,375 --> 01:09:34,328
Understood. Out.
- Claesson! They've found him.

410
01:10:37,335 --> 01:10:44,571
In all probability, we've found the
killer. The description fits.

411
01:10:44,655 --> 01:10:50,332
We've been able to link the dead
person to the crimes in the parks.

412
01:10:50,415 --> 01:10:57,253
None of our efforts have been wasted.
We've been put to the test.

413
01:10:57,335 --> 01:11:04,730
That's the reason for our success.
I think the public can relax now.

414
01:11:44,055 --> 01:11:51,973
Martin Beck. I want Dragan brought
here for an identification. Now!

415
01:12:01,575 --> 01:12:07,332
- Lennart? Is that you?
- Yes.

416
01:12:15,695 --> 01:12:20,769
Shall we read the book?
- Yes.

417
01:12:35,335 --> 01:12:39,931
Well? Is that him?

418
01:12:40,015 --> 01:12:46,454
Is he the man you saw on the evening
of June 2 in Vanadislunden?

419
01:12:46,535 --> 01:12:53,213
- I can't say.
- Why not?

420
01:12:53,295 --> 01:13:00,212
Stop messing around. Was he the one
or not? Answer now, damn it!

421
01:13:00,295 --> 01:13:04,493
Was that a threat?

422
01:13:04,575 --> 01:13:11,413
We just want to know if you
recognize the dead guy or not.

423
01:13:11,495 --> 01:13:16,694
As I said, I can't say.

424
01:13:16,775 --> 01:13:23,123
Right now anyway. I'm stuck in an isolation cell
in the Special Section.

425
01:13:23,215 --> 01:13:29,085
It's fucking unpleasant.
I want to be with the others.

426
01:13:29,175 --> 01:13:34,932
Really? And what should we do about that?

427
01:13:35,015 --> 01:13:39,566
Talk to the superintendent.
Refer to Section 20 of the Penal Code.

428
01:13:39,655 --> 01:13:46,413
So if you didn't have to sit in isolation,
perhaps you'd recognize this man?

429
01:13:48,295 --> 01:13:51,685
Maybe. Maybe not.

430
01:13:51,775 --> 01:13:55,927
Bloody rat!

431
01:14:03,735 --> 01:14:09,287
I'll do what I can.
But I can't promise anything.

432
01:14:09,375 --> 01:14:15,007
He rapes little girls
...and murders them.

433
01:14:16,015 --> 01:14:19,928
It isn't him.

434
01:16:00,935 --> 01:16:06,726
What was she hit with?
- The shaft of a hammer.

435
01:16:52,055 --> 01:16:55,764
Stig-Åke Malm, what's this about?

436
01:16:55,855 --> 01:16:59,768
You drew some hasty conclusions.

437
01:17:00,855 --> 01:17:06,373
You take over now, Einar.
Concentrate on Tegnérlunden,

438
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:12,849
Tegnérgatan, Västmannagatan,
Upplandsgatan to Drottninggatan.

439
01:17:27,335 --> 01:17:32,568
I'm looking for Inspector Beck.
- He's busy.

440
01:17:32,655 --> 01:17:37,092
How do I get to see Inspector Beck?
- Do you have an appointment?

441
01:17:37,175 --> 01:17:42,124
If you don't have one, it will be difficult.
I'm sorry.

442
01:17:42,215 --> 01:17:46,891
Beck told me to come here.

443
01:17:57,975 --> 01:18:02,253
Good morning.
This is about Bosse, my little boy.

444
01:18:02,335 --> 01:18:06,453
I remember Bosse in the pedal car, yes.

445
01:18:06,535 --> 01:18:12,212
He kept on about the tick
he had got from the man in the park.

446
01:18:12,295 --> 01:18:18,086
I didn't understand what a "tick" was.
I thought it might be some Chiclet gum

447
01:18:18,175 --> 01:18:23,727
but then I found this subway ticket
in his jacket pocket.

448
01:18:23,815 --> 01:18:27,808
You said I should come here
if I thought of something.

449
01:18:27,895 --> 01:18:33,492
It was stamped June 2 at 16:30.

450
01:18:36,175 --> 01:18:42,967
No fingerprints. The paper is too rough.

451
01:18:43,055 --> 01:18:49,494
It was stamped at the Rådmansgatan Station.
...The Handelshögskolan exit.

452
01:18:49,575 --> 01:18:55,013
The subway station nearest Vanadislunden?
- Yes.

453
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:06,012
So you were on duty on June 2
in Vanadislunden?

454
01:20:06,095 --> 01:20:11,294
I thought I recognized you.
A young woman had a fight with you.

455
01:20:11,375 --> 01:20:14,685
Yes, a woman in her 30s.

456
01:20:14,775 --> 01:20:22,807
Didn't she say something about missing clothes?
- Clothing? No, she was angry about everything.

457
01:20:22,895 --> 01:20:28,970
Did she give her name
or tell you where she was working?

458
01:20:32,535 --> 01:20:39,646
It was a day care centre in Frejgatan.
- A day care centre in Frejgatan?

459
01:20:41,415 --> 01:20:48,685
Yes, I remember. In May some children's
clothing disappeared from the dryer.

460
01:20:48,775 --> 01:20:54,850
Underwear, panties?
- Yes, that's it precisely.

461
01:20:55,855 --> 01:20:59,814
Does anyone living in the building
look like this?

462
01:21:01,935 --> 01:21:07,805
I don't know.
- Even approximately?

463
01:21:09,695 --> 01:21:13,244
Fransson.

464
01:21:41,055 --> 01:21:44,525
Thank you.

465
01:23:04,215 --> 01:23:07,048
Hello.

466
01:23:07,135 --> 01:23:12,926
Yes, it's absolutely crystal clear.
There's no doubt.

467
01:23:13,015 --> 01:23:18,453
Send out an APB for Olof Fransson.
Olof with an "f".

468
01:23:18,535 --> 01:23:24,770
Fransson with a... If you'd just shut up,
maybe it would work better.

469
01:23:24,855 --> 01:23:28,291
132 Sveavägen. Nothing personal.

470
01:23:28,375 --> 01:23:35,133
The observatory on Observatoriekullen?
- He works at the Stockholm Observatory.

471
01:23:35,215 --> 01:23:39,731
Thank you. Can you connect me to Forensics?

472
01:23:43,735 --> 01:23:51,972
There's a telescope up there.
You can look at the sky. Do you want to see it?

473
01:24:11,175 --> 01:24:15,009
Only one staircase.

474
01:24:53,775 --> 01:24:57,211
Do you see anything?

475
01:25:01,455 --> 01:25:04,447
Eva!

476
01:25:04,535 --> 01:25:07,174
Eva!

477
01:25:53,095 --> 01:25:56,326
Eva?

478
01:25:56,415 --> 01:26:02,684
You should go home now.
Your mother's calling you. Come now.

479
01:26:03,695 --> 01:26:07,324
Yes. Come on then.

480
01:26:07,415 --> 01:26:11,374
Hurry now.
