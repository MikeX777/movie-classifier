1
00:00:02,586 --> 00:00:05,380
(lion roars, snarls)

2
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:22,189
(chatter)

3
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:46,171
(chatter)

4
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,660
(chatter)

5
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,010
(chatter, water splashing)

6
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:52,571
(man coughs)

7
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,281
(chatter)

8
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,116
(bell rings)

9
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,936
(laughing)

10
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,565
(patter of balls
hitting paddles)

11
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,984
(funky pop rock music)

12
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:29,167
(electropop music)

13
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:46,036
(electropop music continues)

14
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,875
(shrill screeching)

15
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,727
(music fades)

16
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,187
(loud clattering)

17
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,337
(kissy noises)

18
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,052
(bird chitters)

19
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,584
"My dearest niece."

20
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:21,047
"It’s have been a long time..."

21
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,766
(chuckles)

22
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,675
(soft pop music plays)

23
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,969
(boat horn blows)

24
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,474
(indistinct chatter)

25
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,020
...tenth decimal.

26
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,563
Oh, that’s it!

27
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,607
Damnit! I’ve been trying
to debug that program

28
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:21,816
for the whole week.

29
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,109
My God!

30
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,903
I don’t know about your guy,

31
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:27,447
but my guy should be
a nice-looking Chinese guy

32
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,199
who is perfectly circumcised.

33
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,034
-Perfectly?
-Perfectly.

34
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,744
(laughing)

35
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:35,038
(running footsteps)

36
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,709
(heels clicking)

37
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,506
Thank you, dear.

38
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,384
(slurping) Mm.

39
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:50,428
(sighs)

40
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:57,268
What do you have to say
about your report card, son?

41
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,687
Nothing.

42
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,438
Professor Chuang
just called.

43
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,692
He said you only showed up
for his Chinese 1 class once.

44
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:04,943
Ha.

45
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,778
I have been going
to Chinese class

46
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,780
ever since I can remember.
You know what?

47
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,448
I never got to watch
Bugs Bunny.

48
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:14,703
Son, nobody should deny
his own cultural background.

49
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:17,580
Although we sent you
to Chinese school every year,

50
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,333
but you still
don’t speak Chinese!

51
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,093
(chatter)

52
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,601
(soft patting)

53
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,150
(muffled music plays)

54
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:49,028
(water trickling)

55
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,705
(makes honk noise)

56
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:09,901
(sighs)

57
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,992
Ahh.

58
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,168
(laughing)

59
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,386
(clears throat)

60
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,350
(sings in Italian)

61
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,487
(laughing)

62
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,453
(continues singing)

63
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,468
(panting)

64
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,554
We’ve been preparing
for a trip to Peking

65
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:22,098
for the last five years.

66
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:25,643
He has a standing invitation
from his sister in Peking.

67
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:28,396
And the China Computer Society.

68
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,106
I even took him
seriously once

69
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,983
and took a class in Chinese.

70
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,526
I thought you spoke Chinese.

71
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,069
Can’t you tell?

72
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,572
I’m an American.

73
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:38,740
Right.

74
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,537
No, I don’t know
about our President Wilson.

75
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,247
He’s so indecisive.

76
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,498
Ah.

77
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,083
I mean, it’s only natural.

78
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,210
After all, you’ve been in charge
of that PC Division

79
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,921
for the past four years now.

80
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,214
I only did the technical part
of the project.

81
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,051
You have done all this
administrative work, haven’t ya?

82
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,928
Well, somebody
must mop the floor.

83
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:02,388
Not that I enjoy it.
I was told to do it.

84
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,890
Hey, Jimmy!
How are you doing?

85
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,308
Hey, Leo.

86
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:06,768
Congratulations,
I heard the word

87
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:10,271
about you becoming the new
director of the PC Division.

88
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,565
-Thank you.
-You really deserve it.

89
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,983
But it hasn’t been
official yet.

90
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:21,950
Today, we are going to
have new lesson.

91
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,918
Listen to me carefully.

92
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,136
(laughing)

93
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:45,723
"My hometown
is a beautiful place.

94
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,601
It stands beside
a wide river

95
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,479
at the foot of low green hills.

96
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,731
It has many fine buildings

97
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:57,235
and very wide streets.

98
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,487
There are trees and flowers
everywhere."

99
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,831
"But it has not always been
like that."

100
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,544
"In the old days,

101
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:18,381
it was a sad,
dirty little town."

102
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:19,716
(giggling)

103
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:23,678
Do you understand that?

104
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:36,024
(laughing)

105
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:36,983
River.

106
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:42,697
River.

107
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:45,199
(bell ringing)

108
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,625
(chatter)

109
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,971
(inaudible whispering)

110
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,065
(coin jangles on ground)

111
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:24,947
(clap)

112
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,283
(giggling)

113
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,871
Ni hao.

114
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,465
(insects chirring)

115
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,217
Well, Jim here’s
already discussed

116
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:27,135
our income for the year.

117
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:30,263
Keep it up, gentlemen,
and Frances.

118
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:32,974
Ah.

119
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:35,643
Our PC computer,
Comprecot,

120
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,353
has been very competitive

121
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:40,565
thanks to Leo, Neil,
and their fellow workers.

122
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,108
It therefore should come
as no surprise

123
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:45,153
that we’ve decided to establish
a new PC Division.

124
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,572
(screen retractor whirring)

125
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:54,787
The new director
of this PC Division is...

126
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,747
Mr. Neil Mahoney.

127
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,374
(indistinct whispering)

128
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,959
And Comprecot’s inventor,
Leo Fang,

129
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,211
has been promoted
to headquarters

130
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,046
as senior member
of the technical staff

131
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,716
to our senior vice president.

132
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:09,886
(telephone ringing)

133
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,387
Five years ago, you told me

134
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,723
I didn’t have enough experience
to be the director.

135
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:16,559
Now, Neil Mahoney
has less experience

136
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,894
than I had five years ago!

137
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,562
There are other considerations.

138
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,480
-Like what?
-Well, such as youth.

139
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,857
Neil is younger than you.

140
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:24,817
Oh, you’re telling me
I’m too old for this job.

141
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,527
No, I don’t mean that at all.

142
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,113
Now look, Neil has lots
of good qualities.

143
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:32,074
Now, listen to me, Leo!

144
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,368
Neil. Neil doesn’t know
the system well.

145
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,578
He’ll learn! He’ll learn.

146
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:38,539
Look, you have a real good job,
very high up in the company.

147
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,749
Hardly any hassle.

148
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,417
Let me tell you
what I think you’re thinking.

149
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,877
Let me tell you.

150
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:45,046
You don’t believe the Chinaman
is good enough

151
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:47,256
to be the director,
that’s what you’re thinking.

152
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:50,468
(soft music)

153
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:51,552
(door slams)

154
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:55,932
(telephone ringing)

155
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:58,351
(dramatic music)

156
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,115
(beeping)

157
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,371
(forcefully sniffs)

158
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,289
Forty years.

159
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:24,877
(coffee pouring)

160
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,045
(gasps)

161
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,964
Damn.

162
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:30,383
(music continues)

163
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,678
(softly blows)

164
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,602
(beeping)

165
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,985
Mr. Wilson?

166
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,152
Wilson!

167
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:53,781
(dramatic musical chord)

168
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,200
(operatic singing)

169
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,684
(soft piano music)

170
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:28,399
(singing continues)

171
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:31,462
(singing continues)

172
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,263
(insects chirring)

173
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,399
If you want to study
English well,

174
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,317
you must study hard.

175
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:56,404
(sips)

176
00:19:56,404 --> 00:20:00,825
That means memorizing
the dictionary.

177
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,410
(sips)

178
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,912
When I was young,

179
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:08,666
I used to memorize
50 words a day.

180
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,955
(urinating)

181
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,670
(grunts)

182
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,797
(giggling)

183
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,597
(moaning)

184
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,519
Let’s get married.

185
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,854
-Come on.
-Now.

186
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:13,355
Your father
might come home early.

187
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:16,275
He pretends he’s in China now.

188
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:20,738
Paul, are you really
going to China this summer?

189
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:24,074
Actually, I don’t think we’re
ever really gonna get there.

190
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:24,950
Hm.

191
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,951
You know what?

192
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,620
What?

193
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,289
I don’t think he
really wants to go.

194
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,874
Why not?

195
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,250
Because...

196
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,337
reality often produces
disappointments.

197
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:39,548
Funny old man.

198
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:43,928
Hey, everybody!
I have an announcement to make.

199
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,804
I got tickets
for our vacation.

200
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,431
One month or even longer!

201
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,683
-How’s that?
-Pop!

202
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,644
-For real?
-You bet.

203
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:52,478
(laughing)

204
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:53,938
What--you--
we’re all going?

205
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:55,981
We all go. We deserve it.

206
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,441
You deserve it,
I deserve it.

207
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,401
We finally deserve it.

208
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,819
Oh my--

209
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,363
You mean like all four of us?

210
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:03,864
(laughing)

211
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,368
Oh.

212
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:09,245
(patter of balls
hitting paddles)

213
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:11,121
(sneakers squeaking)

214
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:29,515
(soft music)

215
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,433
Bay, B-A-Y.

216
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,075
(giggling)

217
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:27,281
"Four score
and seven years ago,

218
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:33,871
our fathers brought forth
on this continent, a new nation,

219
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:36,999
a new nation,
conceived in Liberty,

220
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:43,922
and dedicated to the proposition
that all men are created equal.

221
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:49,553
We here highly resolve
that this nation, under God,

222
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:52,640
shall have not...

223
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,228
shall have a new birth
of freedom...

224
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,648
and that government
of the people,

225
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:03,525
by the people,
for the people,

226
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:08,238
shall not perish
from the earth."

227
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,281
(giggling, clapping)

228
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,743
(chuckling)

229
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,003
(tender music)

230
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:16,849
Um, I’m leaving.

231
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,267
-Hi.
-Hi.

232
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,102
I’m leaving.
Hi, Mr. Fang.

233
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:21,687
Have a pleasant trip.

234
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,647
Bye, Linda.

235
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:28,652
(groans)

236
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:36,243
(football game plays on TV)

237
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,578
What’s wrong, Romeo?

238
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,121
Father.

239
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:41,582
(TV chatter continues)

240
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:43,459
Gimme a break.

241
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,714
(sighs)

242
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:50,424
Who’s playing?

243
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:52,634
49ers against Broncos.

244
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,681
Hey, I thought you stopped
seeing Linda.

245
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,183
I will.

246
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,645
When I’m in China.

247
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:06,231
What ever happened
to that nice Chinese girl,

248
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,275
Margaret Wei?

249
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,943
She’s going out
with some white guy.

250
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:13,781
(TV chatter continues)

251
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:15,491
You know...

252
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:18,368
Why don’t you like
Linda as my friend?

253
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:19,745
You know, the only reason
why you don’t like her

254
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,079
is ’cause she’s not Chinese.

255
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,499
Come on, I never suggested
anything like that.

256
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:24,792
It’s true.

257
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:27,419
All Chinese parents
are racists.

258
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,462
What are you talking about?

259
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:29,838
Hey!

260
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,257
You use the tradition
and the culture

261
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,176
to cover up the racism.

262
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:36,178
Really!

263
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:38,222
Why do we have to do everything
the Chinese way anyway?

264
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:41,141
It gets you nowhere.

265
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,894
This is America, ya know?

266
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:46,563
You’ve lived here for so long

267
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,607
and you still talk
with an accent.

268
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,108
What’s wrong with my accent?

269
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,027
I think it’s rather cute.

270
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,988
What’s the weight limit
on each suitcase again?

271
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,657
(grunts)

272
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:59,326
-44 pounds.
-Yes, yes! Sack him! Sack him!

273
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,786
Sack him--oh.

274
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:03,997
Here’s an interesting
paragraph

275
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,874
about the city of Peking.

276
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:06,917
Listen.

277
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:08,043
"Peking is a city--"

278
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:11,421
Peking is a city
surrounded by walls.

279
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:12,756
Big, thick walls.

280
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:16,343
What? Why?

281
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,387
To keep the invaders out

282
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:21,682
or to confine the natives in.

283
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:23,851
It is just as difficult
to leave the city

284
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:27,396
as to go back.

285
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:30,065
What does your sister say
in the letter?

286
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:35,112
Oh...they still didn’t do
anything about father’s grave.

287
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:36,905
-Oh no.
-(gong rings)

288
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:40,033
(mellow electronic music)

289
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:43,287
(traffic passing)

290
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:01,096
Where’s the wall?

291
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:06,184
"The Great Wall is located
60 miles northwest of the city."

292
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,769
I don’t mean that wall.

293
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,404
"The wall of Peking City
was torn down

294
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,906
right after liberation

295
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:21,533
for the purpose of expanding
the nation’s capital."

296
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,410
Gee, what do you know?

297
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,704
China expert, huh?

298
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:29,958
The guidebook
doesn’t lie all the time.

299
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,544
Those damn high-rises.

300
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,963
(music continues)

301
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:45,891
(engine buzzing)

302
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,562
(music continues)

303
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:52,207
Leo told me all about you.

304
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,253
Hey, Lili.

305
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,015
(baby crying)

306
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:14,021
Sorry.

307
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,237
(murmur of chatter)

308
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,794
(soft music)

309
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,404
(birdsong)

310
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,036
(insects chirring)

311
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:13,413
(indistinct chatter)

312
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:51,493
He’s asking about your cooking,

313
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,495
your Chinese cooking.

314
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:54,996
Oh!

315
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,957
I only know how to cook
beef noodles.

316
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:10,470
What do you do for fun
at school?

317
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,888
Huh?

318
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:14,808
Um...for fun?

319
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:16,434
(giggling)

320
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,450
We don’t play.

321
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:35,287
We...study.

322
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,418
Do you play sports?

323
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:42,627
-Sports?
-Sports.

324
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:49,259
I play ping-pong.

325
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:51,636
Oh, no kidding?
That’s great. That’s great!

326
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,847
That used to be my sport.

327
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:09,738
They want us to move in.

328
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:11,323
Well prepared.

329
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:54,366
Leo, do you think they like me?

330
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:56,117
Sure.

331
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:59,579
They’re crazy about you,
believe me.

332
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:03,875
I feel like I’ve known them
for a long time.

333
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:04,918
Of course.

334
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:07,337
You all belonged to the same
herd of cattle

335
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:10,882
in your previous lives.

336
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,218
Dad?

337
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:14,552
Hm?

338
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:19,975
They don’t have
a shower bath here.

339
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:21,977
Too bad.

340
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:24,396
Are you warm enough, Paul?

341
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:26,398
Are you kidding? I’m hot.

342
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,734
(insects chirring)

343
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:33,113
They have squat toilets.

344
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:34,990
Yeah.

345
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,283
I don’t think
I’ve quite developed

346
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:38,910
the leg muscles for them.

347
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,538
You need practice.

348
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:44,124
Oh, shut up.
Go to sleep, will ya?

349
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,172
(click)

350
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,027
(crackling)

351
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:21,870
(commotion)

352
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:45,226
(insects chirring)

353
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,144
(sighs)

354
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,645
(thunder rumbling)

355
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,755
(gong rings)

356
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:21,174
(mellow music)

357
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:41,611
(tender music)

358
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:29,867
(solemn music)

359
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:08,489
Sonny? Come here.

360
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:17,498
Here’s the old man
I told you about.

361
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:20,919
He’s funnier than you and I
put together.

362
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:22,712
Funny man.

363
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:25,131
(birds chittering)

364
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,933
(solemn music)

365
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,899
(rumble of engines)

366
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:39,288
(upbeat pop music)

367
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,168
(laughs)

368
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:09,587
(music continues)

369
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:46,082
(overlapping chatter)

370
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:47,708
(laughter)

371
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,639
(grunts)

372
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,623
(birds chirping)

373
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:46,475
(flatulence)

374
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:10,750
I can’t believe this.

375
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:11,876
Look at this.

376
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:15,004
She reads all your mail!

377
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:20,509
Well, haven’t you ever heard
of a thing called privacy?

378
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:22,470
Privacy?

379
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:25,932
-Privacy.
-Privacy.

380
00:45:25,932 --> 00:45:28,768
(laughs)

381
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:30,561
Yeah, all right.

382
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,021
I guess there’s no such a thing
in China.

383
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:34,440
(patter of balls
hitting paddles)

384
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:51,499
(inaudible)

385
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,383
Thanks.

386
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,185
(indistinct conversation)

387
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:31,497
(patter of balls
hitting paddles)

388
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,227
Thank you.

389
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,409
(upbeat funky music)

390
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:36,437
-Paul?
-Hm?

391
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:38,272
(giggling)

392
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:40,399
Oh, hey, hey, hey,
look at this.

393
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:46,864
What do you think?

394
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,741
"Put the...

395
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:51,786
Put the Great Wall
On Your Chest."

396
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:53,662
(laughing)

397
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:56,165
Hey? Look.

398
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:58,334
This is just what Linda needs.

399
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:01,962
Hey, I’ll buy it.

400
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:04,298
(indistinct chatter,
playful banter)

401
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:11,055
He’s running,
he’s zigzagging,

402
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:12,306
he’s slipping through!

403
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,474
What!

404
00:48:13,474 --> 00:48:16,769
It’s a touchdown! Oh my God!

405
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:19,188
(birds cawing)

406
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:24,443
The Great Wall was built
thousands of years ago

407
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:27,279
to prevent invaders
from the north.

408
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:29,073
Didn’t work.

409
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:30,241
Nope.

410
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:33,494
The invaders are from the south.

411
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:35,996
(soft music)

412
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:38,415
(wind blowing)

413
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:46,632
(cicadas chirring)

414
00:48:53,514 --> 00:48:55,933
(leaves rustling)

415
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:08,821
(cicadas chirring)

416
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:11,240
(shoes clicking on tile)

417
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,954
(indistinct conversation)

418
00:49:23,836 --> 00:49:25,629
(door squeaks)

419
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,621
(equipment whirring)

420
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:29,485
(keys clacking)

421
00:50:32,655 --> 00:50:34,573
(shrill whir of printer)

422
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:35,699
Crazy.

423
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:40,996
Ah-ha! This character is wrong.

424
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:44,166
No, this only
simplified version.

425
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:46,001
(chuckling)

426
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:48,420
(insects chirring)

427
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:00,724
(laughing)

428
00:51:04,353 --> 00:51:07,022
He speaks Chinese all the time
with his relatives

429
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:09,149
and his Chinese friends
in the States.

430
00:51:28,711 --> 00:51:30,796
He earns $0 now.

431
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:30,898
(laughter)

432
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:32,691
That was a cup of hot coffee.

433
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:34,234
Very hot.

434
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:55,130
Leo! What are you talking about?

435
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,840
Never mind.

436
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:01,136
(chuckles)

437
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:09,144
Oh, Chinese fabrics
are so beautiful.

438
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:11,647
It’s too bad they don’t pay more
attention to fashion design.

439
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:27,246
Oh, it’s too short.
Too short.

440
00:53:35,421 --> 00:53:38,257
Don’t you think
it’s too long?

441
00:53:38,257 --> 00:53:39,550
Long? Too long?

442
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,150
(she laughs)

443
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:57,651
I don’t think I could
fit into this.

444
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:10,080
Gee, I’m too old
for a maternity dress!

445
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:27,598
Oh, you’re gonna sew it.

446
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:35,230
(tender music)

447
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,274
(snipping)

448
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:39,651
(rapid clicking)

449
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:48,160
Oh, it’s too big!

450
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,329
I haven’t been this big
since I had Paul!

451
00:54:52,331 --> 00:54:53,665
Look at me.
I look pregnant.

452
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,209
Oh, gee.

453
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:57,294
It’s too--look at it!

454
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,713
(tender music)

455
00:55:12,518 --> 00:55:14,228
Oh, there.

456
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:16,063
Look. Look!

457
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:16,939
(giggling)

458
00:55:16,939 --> 00:55:19,191
No, no, no, no!

459
00:55:19,191 --> 00:55:21,318
Oh, you look lovely.

460
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:26,490
Wrinkles?

461
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,367
No, you don’t have any wrinkles.

462
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:32,955
Oh, when you were young.

463
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:38,961
Oh, you had a lot of guys.

464
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,593
Well, he’s a little overweight.

465
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:52,975
(imitates loud sipping)

466
00:55:57,062 --> 00:56:00,983
Weekends,
he watches TV all weekend.

467
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:03,235
Watch football, football.

468
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,280
Go, go, go!

469
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:15,872
(tongue click)

470
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:19,418
(snores)

471
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:22,004
-Oh, Leo does the same thing!
-Mama!

472
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:33,390
(mellow music)

473
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:44,985
Who’s Linda?

474
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:48,572
Oh, she’s just one
of Paul’s friends.

475
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:50,490
Paul has many friends.

476
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:53,368
He’s very popular.

477
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:55,871
(cicadas chirring)

478
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:58,290

(cicadas chirring)

484
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:14,658
Hey, Mom!

485
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:16,076
Here she is!

486
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:19,246
(sings playfully)

487
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:21,957

488
00:58:21,957 --> 00:58:24,376

(indistinct whispering)

512
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:50,947
Running out again?

(indistinct mumbling)

514
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:56,536

(Leo chuckles)

517
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,850

(beep, exclamation)

532
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:04,422
Fourth down, 15 to go.

533
01:13:04,422 --> 01:13:06,257
You’re dead.

534
01:13:06,257 --> 01:13:08,384
-You want bet?
-Yeah.

537
01:13:19,186 --> 01:13:20,354
Lili!

538
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:48,883
-Broken there?
-Huh?

539
01:13:48,883 --> 01:13:51,135
Oh, this?
No, you know, this, uh...

540
01:13:51,135 --> 01:13:53,095
this is the style, you know?

541
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:55,431
It’s, uh, fashion.

542
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:56,766
This is the best, really.

543
01:13:56,766 --> 01:13:58,601
Pierre Cardin,
I’m not kidding you.

544
01:13:58,601 --> 01:13:59,769

545
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:20,873

546
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:21,999
No.

547
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:23,417
You know, you don’t understand.

548
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:25,086
You know, these, uh...

549
01:14:25,086 --> 01:14:27,963
you know, these here,
these are Calvin Kleins.

550

(lively guitar music)

551
01:14:51,404 --> 01:14:52,947
Go

552
01:14:52,947 --> 01:14:56,075
Go, Johnny, go, go

553
01:14:56,075 --> 01:15:00,287
Go, Johnny,

558
01:17:17,049 --> 01:17:18,342
How’s your ping-pong?

559
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:20,135
My coach says I’m gonna be
the best one in the bunch

560
01:17:20,135 --> 01:17:23,681
if I could just
get my serve down.

561
01:17:23,681 --> 01:17:25,558
You know, that, um...

562
01:17:25,558 --> 01:17:27,935
that singles title coming up?

563
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:30,563
No problem, man,
I’m gonna take it.

564
01:17:30,563 --> 01:17:33,190
Wow, you gonna play
against Liu?

565
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:36,443
Lili, didn’t your boyfriend
Liu win the title last year?

566
01:17:38,612 --> 01:17:41,323
All right, this is gonna be hot.

567
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:42,908
Is it a major match?

568
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:46,328
I don’t know.
It’s major for me.

569
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:48,831
Look at those two guys
checking you out.

570
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:50,791
Look at this, they’re really
checking you out.

571
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:53,002
Why is a nice Chinese girl
like you

572
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:56,213
hanging around with
foreign devils like us?

573
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:01,510
Mom!

574
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:04,638
Your favorite niece
is in a funny mood.

575
01:18:04,638 --> 01:18:06,390
Again.

576
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:07,766
Stop teasing her.

577
01:18:07,766 --> 01:18:09,018
Give her some privacy.

578
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:12,897
Oh, come on, I’m cool.

579
01:18:12,897 --> 01:18:13,689
When are we gonna eat?

580
01:18:26,911 --> 01:18:28,871
Ready to move back
to the hotel tonight?

581
01:18:28,871 --> 01:18:30,831
Huh?

582
01:18:30,831 --> 01:18:32,958
Not really.

583
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:35,294
I’m kinda getting
used to this place.

584
01:18:35,294 --> 01:18:36,337
Developing my leg muscles.

585
01:18:42,009 --> 01:18:43,427
We’re moving back
to the hotel.

586
01:18:43,427 --> 01:18:45,012
Your father told me
this morning.

587
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:47,973
Why?

588
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:49,642
Just because of Lili?

589
01:18:49,642 --> 01:18:51,393
There is one thing
in this country

590
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:55,314
that causes more concern than
the Super Bowl game back home.

591
01:18:55,314 --> 01:18:56,398
No kidding.

592
01:18:56,398 --> 01:18:59,235
The annual college
entrance examination.

593
01:18:59,235 --> 01:19:02,321
I know, I know.
It’s like a 1 in 100 chance

594
01:19:02,321 --> 01:19:04,615
and, um, if you don’t make it,

595
01:19:04,615 --> 01:19:06,951
then you have to sell tea
in the streets.

596
01:19:06,951 --> 01:19:12,581
Well...I think Lili would make
a beautiful tea peddler.

597
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:14,959
Go inside and pack!

598
01:19:14,959 --> 01:19:16,126
Okay!

599
01:20:10,681 --> 01:20:13,100
(soft music)

600
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:03,067
(soft dramatic music)

601
01:21:03,067 --> 01:21:05,486
(birds chirping)

602
01:21:11,909 --> 01:21:13,869
(indistinct conversation)

603
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:16,121
(patter of balls
hitting paddles)

604
01:21:31,762 --> 01:21:34,181
(music fades, ends)

605
01:21:36,934 --> 01:21:39,436
(indistinct whining)

606
01:21:58,288 --> 01:22:01,667
(siren wailing)

607
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:19,518
(birds chirping)

608
01:22:28,652 --> 01:22:30,946
(murmur of crowd chatter)

609
01:22:47,546 --> 01:22:49,756
(bell ringing)

610
01:23:04,521 --> 01:23:07,316
(soft dramatic music)

611
01:23:33,884 --> 01:23:36,970
(sweepers whirring)

612
01:23:36,970 --> 01:23:39,932
(hammering)

613
01:23:39,932 --> 01:23:42,976
(murmur of crowd chatter)

614
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:45,187
(insects chirring)

615
01:24:30,190 --> 01:24:31,525
(lively music and singing)

616
01:24:37,489 --> 01:24:38,532
(radio clicks off)

617
01:24:58,969 --> 01:25:00,512
So what?

618
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:14,651
(patter of balls
hitting paddles)

619
01:25:23,994 --> 01:25:25,495
(grunts)

620
01:25:41,136 --> 01:25:43,305
(indistinct conversation)

621
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:02,199
(patter of balls
hitting paddles)

622
01:26:16,588 --> 01:26:17,672
(murmur of crowd chatter)

623
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:28,016
Next will be the final
for the men’s singles.

624
01:26:28,016 --> 01:26:31,937
The competitors are Paul Fang,
a Chinese American player,

625
01:26:31,937 --> 01:26:34,189
and champion of
the Youth Ping-Pong Tournament

626
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:38,110
and from Southwest
California, USA.

627
01:26:43,907 --> 01:26:46,743
(whistling, applause)

628
01:26:56,086 --> 01:26:58,505
(tense, dramatic music)

629
01:27:12,602 --> 01:27:15,355
(tense upbeat music)

630
01:27:15,355 --> 01:27:17,190
(applause)

631
01:27:24,573 --> 01:27:26,366
(applause)

632
01:27:39,045 --> 01:27:41,465
(music continues)

633
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:45,760
(applause)

634
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:04,112
(applause)

635
01:28:07,908 --> 01:28:10,327
(music continues)

636
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:18,251
(applause)

637
01:28:37,771 --> 01:28:40,065
(music continues)

638
01:28:48,406 --> 01:28:50,408
(applause)

639
01:28:55,497 --> 01:28:58,041
(patter of ball
hitting paddles)

640
01:28:58,041 --> 01:28:59,543
(applause)

641
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:12,013

642
01:29:12,013 --> 01:29:14,432

643
01:29:22,357 --> 01:29:24,442
(cheering, applause)

644
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:42,335
(cheering, applause)

645
01:29:46,673 --> 01:29:48,091
The kid is killing it.

646
01:29:48,091 --> 01:29:49,259
Yeah.

647
01:29:51,803 --> 01:29:54,222
(cheering, applause)

648
01:29:58,852 --> 01:30:01,104
(patter of ball
hitting paddles)

649
01:30:05,275 --> 01:30:07,694
(applause, whistling)

650
01:30:14,242 --> 01:30:16,494
(crowd quiets)

651
01:30:17,537 --> 01:30:20,290
(tense music)

652
01:30:44,981 --> 01:30:48,652
(music intensifies)

653
01:30:53,031 --> 01:30:55,033
(cheering, applause)

654
01:31:04,084 --> 01:31:06,670
(applause, cheering)

655
01:31:06,670 --> 01:31:09,422
(patter of ball
hitting paddles)

656
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:17,347
(applause)

657
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:34,322
(patter of ball
hitting paddles)

658
01:31:39,452 --> 01:31:41,913
(applause)

659
01:31:50,130 --> 01:31:52,632
(slow, echoing taps)

660
01:32:01,474 --> 01:32:03,476
(crowd roars
with applause, cheering)

661
01:32:27,292 --> 01:32:29,711
(shower water trickling)

662
01:32:40,930 --> 01:32:43,433
How do you feel,
dick breath?

663
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:49,773
Oh, great.

664
01:32:49,773 --> 01:32:52,650
Super great.

665
01:32:52,650 --> 01:32:53,693
(sighs)

666
01:32:53,693 --> 01:32:55,904
You had a tough match today,
didn’t you?

667
01:32:58,615 --> 01:33:01,868
You know, I play to win.

668
01:33:01,868 --> 01:33:04,162
I hate losing.

669
01:33:04,162 --> 01:33:06,956
I hate it so much.

670
01:33:06,956 --> 01:33:08,917
Listen, Sonny, see,

671
01:33:08,917 --> 01:33:11,544
you played the best game ever.

672
01:33:11,544 --> 01:33:14,297
Well, you didn’t win
the championship,

673
01:33:14,297 --> 01:33:18,134
but you know, you gave
the best performance

674
01:33:18,134 --> 01:33:20,094
and gave it the best shot,

675
01:33:20,094 --> 01:33:21,679
and that’s a victory
by itself.

676
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:22,972
Can’t you understand that?

677
01:33:22,972 --> 01:33:24,599
You see, in each tournament,

678
01:33:24,599 --> 01:33:26,851
there’s only one champ

679
01:33:26,851 --> 01:33:28,937
but there are
many, many winners.

680
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:31,523
I think today
you’re one of them winners.

681
01:33:31,523 --> 01:33:33,983
And the ping-pong game
you should look at this way:

682
01:33:33,983 --> 01:33:34,859
it’s not a game--

683
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:35,902
Hey, Dad?

684
01:33:35,902 --> 01:33:37,570
I’m kinda hungry, you know?

685
01:33:37,570 --> 01:33:42,325
So, uh...why don’t you
save your bullshit?

686
01:33:42,325 --> 01:33:43,451
Okay.

687
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:46,788
Okay. Let me treat you
to one of those, uh,

688
01:33:46,788 --> 01:33:52,544
grand Peking duck feasts
with warm Coca-Cola.

689
01:33:52,544 --> 01:33:54,170
Warm Coca-Cola.

690
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:55,338
Okay.

691
01:33:57,549 --> 01:34:00,802
You know, if you want to
say it right,

692
01:34:00,802 --> 01:34:03,263
you gotta say
"penis breath."

693
01:34:03,263 --> 01:34:05,723
-Yeah?
-It’s penis breath.

694
01:34:05,723 --> 01:34:08,518
How about, uh...
turkey tits?

695
01:34:08,518 --> 01:34:10,603
(laughing)

696
01:34:10,603 --> 01:34:12,355
That’s kinda old.

697
01:34:12,355 --> 01:34:14,732
Yeah, I assume so.

698
01:34:14,732 --> 01:34:17,151
(soft music)

699
01:34:20,488 --> 01:34:21,823
Hi, Grace.

700
01:34:21,823 --> 01:34:23,366
Mr. Wilson.

701
01:34:23,366 --> 01:34:24,450
What a surprise.

702
01:34:24,450 --> 01:34:25,910
My, you look lovely.

703
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:28,162
Oh, thank you.
It’s a Chinese peasant blouse.

704
01:34:28,162 --> 01:34:30,957
-Elegant, elegant.
-Do come in.

705
01:34:30,957 --> 01:34:32,208
How was your trip to China?

706
01:34:32,208 --> 01:34:33,543
Oh, it was wonderful.

707
01:34:33,543 --> 01:34:34,878
Oh, boy, you were gone
for how long--

708
01:34:34,878 --> 01:34:36,588
People in America
think I’m too Chinese

709
01:34:36,588 --> 01:34:38,339
and then people in China
think I’m too American.

710
01:34:38,339 --> 01:34:39,799
What do you have
to say about that?

711
01:34:39,799 --> 01:34:42,176
(speaks poorly in Chinese)

712
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:43,636
Bossman.

713
01:34:43,636 --> 01:34:44,846
No, not exactly.

714
01:34:44,846 --> 01:34:46,764
(speaks in Chinese)

715
01:34:46,764 --> 01:34:48,433
(giggles)

716
01:34:48,433 --> 01:34:50,852
(birds chirping)

717
01:35:01,905 --> 01:35:04,365
The Chinese doctor
stuck needles in my back

718
01:35:04,365 --> 01:35:06,451
and there was this
funny tingling sensation,

719
01:35:06,451 --> 01:35:07,577
but it works.

720
01:35:07,577 --> 01:35:09,078
Works like a charm.

721
01:35:09,078 --> 01:35:10,663
Magic, magic.

722
01:35:14,042 --> 01:35:16,377
Looking good, Leo!

723
01:35:20,173 --> 01:35:22,592
(birds chirping)

724
01:35:33,645 --> 01:35:36,689
(grunt, flatulence)

725
01:35:36,689 --> 01:35:38,149
(sighs)

726
01:35:38,149 --> 01:35:40,568
(rhythmic cymbal tapping
and drumming)

727
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:50,787
(indistinct whispering)

728
01:35:50,787 --> 01:35:54,624
(giggling)

729
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:56,376
(whistles)

730
01:35:56,376 --> 01:35:59,420
(applause)

731
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:01,839
(cymbal tapping
and drumming continues)

732
01:36:23,319 --> 01:36:25,905
(chatter, commotion)

733
01:36:31,911 --> 01:36:34,330
(lively traditional music)

734
01:36:40,211 --> 01:36:42,630
(indistinct chatter)

735
01:36:51,264 --> 01:36:55,685
(soft traditional music
and singing)

736
01:37:22,795 --> 01:37:24,338
Quarterback, get up!

737
01:37:24,338 --> 01:37:25,590
Game time.

738
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:28,009
(music and singing continue)

739
01:37:54,243 --> 01:37:56,746
(soft drumming)

740
01:38:14,806 --> 01:38:17,225
(lively drum music)

741
01:38:21,104 --> 01:38:23,815
(singing and music continue)

742
01:39:22,165 --> 01:39:24,625
(music and singing continue)

743
01:40:00,536 --> 01:40:02,955
(music and singing continue)

744
01:41:08,437 --> 01:41:10,898
(singing and music continue)

745
01:41:37,174 --> 01:41:40,469
(singing ends)

746
01:41:40,469 --> 01:41:42,138
