1
00:01:47,543 --> 00:01:50,706
<i>I can take 150 shares.</i>

2
00:01:51,465 --> 00:01:55,047
50 are for me, I know
where I can place the other 100.

3
00:01:55,951 --> 00:02:00,056
Write it down,
Professor Filippo Morisoni...

4
00:02:00,636 --> 00:02:01,542
150.

5
00:02:01,816 --> 00:02:03,355
And I'll take 25.

6
00:02:04,212 --> 00:02:06,665
Don Gesualdo Malena...

7
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,748
..25.

8
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:10,586
What about you, Don Giacomo?

9
00:02:10,646 --> 00:02:13,104
For me,
you can leave a hundred or so.

10
00:02:13,863 --> 00:02:16,225
Don Giacomo Sordi...

11
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:17,605
100.

12
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,114
That makes...

13
00:02:19,696 --> 00:02:21,535
..275.

14
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:24,473
Maybe I can place another hundred.

15
00:02:25,428 --> 00:02:29,200
Now we need to try and get some
of them into the countryside.

16
00:02:29,931 --> 00:02:31,375
You'll have to deal with that.

17
00:02:31,435 --> 00:02:35,030
It's not easy. They're not very
trusting in the countryside.

18
00:02:35,223 --> 00:02:37,751
How can you speak
about the Freedom Bond

19
00:02:37,811 --> 00:02:39,315
to people
who're suspicious of everything?

20
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:43,513
It doesn't matter, you try. And
I don't think they're mistrustful.

21
00:02:44,148 --> 00:02:47,442
It's something else.
They're disheartened.

22
00:02:47,502 --> 00:02:51,750
You're right, that's true.
The failure of the last uprising...

23
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,726
What do you mean, failure?

24
00:02:54,429 --> 00:02:56,473
Remember the Master's words...

25
00:02:57,205 --> 00:03:01,765
"ln revolutions, every mistake
is a step on the way to the truth."

26
00:03:02,485 --> 00:03:06,931
The secret of power lies in faith,
true virtue in sacrifice.

27
00:03:07,528 --> 00:03:09,462
Eleven were arrested

28
00:03:09,892 --> 00:03:12,135
and four of them
climbed the scaffold.

29
00:03:12,195 --> 00:03:15,196
You can't say they were lacking
in the spirit of sacrifice.

30
00:03:15,358 --> 00:03:19,890
And that's exactly why we shouldn't
consider January 7th 1834

31
00:03:20,249 --> 00:03:24,095
as the date of a defeat,
but rather as a date of glory.

32
00:03:24,779 --> 00:03:26,157
Turn to the young,

33
00:03:26,437 --> 00:03:30,650
speak to the impatient youth
in whom we place our greatest hopes.

34
00:03:31,055 --> 00:03:33,163
What does it matter
if one uprising failed?

35
00:03:33,223 --> 00:03:36,354
Nothing is lost
so long as you still have courage.

36
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,223
The police! Gather everything up!
Hurry up!

37
00:04:12,948 --> 00:04:15,263
I didn't do anything!
Am I not allowed to sing?

38
00:04:15,323 --> 00:04:18,139
We'll really make you sing now!
Take him away!

39
00:04:19,421 --> 00:04:20,550
Get away!

40
00:04:21,642 --> 00:04:23,203
You lot, come with me!

41
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,124
On you go.

42
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,103
On you go!

43
00:04:49,988 --> 00:04:50,801
Hurry!

44
00:04:52,346 --> 00:04:54,175
We'll take the shares to my house.

45
00:04:54,235 --> 00:04:56,157
I'm still not under suspicion.

46
00:05:07,395 --> 00:05:09,949
Take him away!
- Why? What have I done?

47
00:05:10,171 --> 00:05:13,716
What have I done?
Leave me alone! Leave me alone!

48
00:05:13,975 --> 00:05:16,204
Leave me alone! What have I done?

49
00:05:24,828 --> 00:05:26,014
Knock it down!

50
00:05:44,347 --> 00:05:45,706
That way, quickly!

51
00:06:29,743 --> 00:06:30,861
Who's there?

52
00:06:32,181 --> 00:06:33,328
Who's there?

53
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,262
Beatrice?

54
00:06:37,628 --> 00:06:38,592
Beatrice!

55
00:06:39,965 --> 00:06:40,929
Mom...

56
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:43,288
Did you hear that? Was it you?

57
00:06:43,857 --> 00:06:45,070
No, Mom...

58
00:06:49,715 --> 00:06:50,593
Maria?

59
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:53,629
Maria!

60
00:07:06,463 --> 00:07:07,543
Basile...

61
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:09,837
Mom!

62
00:07:10,566 --> 00:07:12,542
Mom! Mom!

63
00:07:13,544 --> 00:07:15,948
Mom! Mom!

64
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:38,050
Mommy...

65
00:09:41,767 --> 00:09:42,538
You...

66
00:09:49,955 --> 00:09:52,117
What are you doing here at this time?

67
00:09:52,177 --> 00:09:55,632
I came to look for you.
Didn't you say you had work to do?

68
00:09:56,201 --> 00:09:57,062
I do.

69
00:09:57,766 --> 00:09:59,791
Where were you? Playing cards?

70
00:09:59,851 --> 00:10:00,609
No.

71
00:10:01,356 --> 00:10:03,220
So why did you go out, then?

72
00:10:03,494 --> 00:10:06,788
I've got things to deal with.
I need to sort them out.

73
00:10:08,889 --> 00:10:10,449
And did you sort them out?

74
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:11,319
Maybe.

75
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,776
Leave me alone now.
I'll tell you about it tomorrow.

76
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,310
Well?

77
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,699
I don't understand you any more.

78
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:26,848
What is it?

79
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:29,387
You've never treated me like this
before.

80
00:10:29,447 --> 00:10:30,815
What do you want?

81
00:10:32,247 --> 00:10:35,198
Leave me alone.
I have to finish this deed.

82
00:10:45,667 --> 00:10:47,022
Tell the truth...

83
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:49,273
Did you lose again?

84
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,046
No, Anna, I swear.

85
00:10:52,174 --> 00:10:53,263
Look at me.

86
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,061
I'd tell you...

87
00:10:57,909 --> 00:10:58,873
honestly.

88
00:11:04,688 --> 00:11:05,816
Who's that?

89
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:20,368
It's your husband, go now.
I'll go down and let him in.

90
00:11:22,874 --> 00:11:23,944
Remember,..

91
00:11:24,252 --> 00:11:26,864
I didn't leave the office this evening.

92
00:12:16,619 --> 00:12:19,208
If it was one of the tenants
from upstairs who barred the door,

93
00:12:19,268 --> 00:12:21,777
tell them not to do it again.
I go out in the evening.

94
00:12:21,837 --> 00:12:22,810
All right.

95
00:12:42,897 --> 00:12:44,468
How did you get on?

96
00:12:44,912 --> 00:12:48,304
All that's missing
is the copy of the will from 1782

97
00:12:48,883 --> 00:12:51,512
and the date it was recorded
at the registry office.

98
00:12:51,572 --> 00:12:53,625
You need to look in the archive.

99
00:12:54,531 --> 00:12:57,398
Volume 270, compartment 25.

100
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,679
Remember it has to be ready
for tomorrow morning.

101
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:02,195
I'll go right away.

102
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:21,877
<i>Don Giacomo!</i>

103
00:13:22,696 --> 00:13:24,007
<i>Don Giacomo...!</i>

104
00:13:28,603 --> 00:13:30,337
Who's there?
- Go right away

105
00:13:30,397 --> 00:13:32,632
to the house
of the Marquis of Rionero!

106
00:13:32,866 --> 00:13:35,947
Something terrible has happened!
<i>- What's happened?</i>

107
00:13:36,007 --> 00:13:38,586
<i>The marquise has been killed!
- When?</i>

108
00:13:38,824 --> 00:13:40,903
<i>This evening, not long ago.</i>

109
00:13:41,366 --> 00:13:44,834
<i>The marquis has just got back in.
Come!</i>

110
00:13:45,285 --> 00:13:47,592
<i>He's waiting for you.
- I'm coming.</i>

111
00:13:53,774 --> 00:13:57,386
Where are you going?
- The Marquise of Rionero, murdered!

112
00:14:19,023 --> 00:14:20,388
Was it you...?
- Shut up!

113
00:14:20,448 --> 00:14:22,628
Was it you? You murderer!

114
00:14:23,634 --> 00:14:24,973
<i>Murderer!
- No!</i>

115
00:14:25,378 --> 00:14:27,920
<i>And this?
It's one of the marquise's rings!</i>

116
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,653
<i>I've seen her wearing it
a thousand times!</i>

117
00:14:29,713 --> 00:14:32,026
<i>And it just fell out of your pocket!</i>

118
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,794
<i>How could you have?</i>

119
00:14:35,739 --> 00:14:37,300
<i>How could you have...?</i>

120
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,018
<i>I don't know... I don't know...</i>

121
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:40,050
<i>Save me!</i>

122
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,633
<i>Do you want to hand me in?</i>

123
00:14:43,693 --> 00:14:44,647
<i>Go away!</i>

124
00:14:44,792 --> 00:14:45,544
<i>Anna!</i>

125
00:14:46,074 --> 00:14:47,048
<i>Go away!</i>

126
00:15:20,803 --> 00:15:22,962
<i>It's the evidence, you can see it.</i>

127
00:15:23,194 --> 00:15:25,044
<i>Ferdinando Maria Baldieri.</i>

128
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,353
It's your scarf.
- I've never denied that.

129
00:15:28,413 --> 00:15:30,050
So why not confess everything?

130
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,071
I can't confess to a crime
I didn't commit.

131
00:15:37,841 --> 00:15:42,234
And yet the scarf was found beneath
the window the murderer escaped from.

132
00:15:42,294 --> 00:15:45,272
You won't deny, I hope,
that you passed by there?

133
00:15:45,706 --> 00:15:47,296
I don't know anything.

134
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:51,666
Not even that the Marquis of Rionero
wasn't in his villa that evening,

135
00:15:51,849 --> 00:15:55,160
that the notary Giacomo Sordi
had delivered

136
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,743
a substantial sum of money to him
the previous day?

137
00:15:57,803 --> 00:16:01,099
I've already said
I don't know the Marquis of Rionero!

138
00:16:04,587 --> 00:16:07,970
The crime took place
shortly before midnight.

139
00:16:08,654 --> 00:16:12,064
Now, it has been demonstrated
that you weren't at home at midnight.

140
00:16:12,124 --> 00:16:13,396
No, I wasn't.

141
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:14,804
Where were you?

142
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:21,777
Where were you?

143
00:16:21,837 --> 00:16:23,157
I won't answer.

144
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:25,247
You're politically suspect.

145
00:16:25,307 --> 00:16:28,315
Had you taken part in some meeting?
- Who were you with?

146
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,252
The dilemma is clear.

147
00:16:30,628 --> 00:16:33,766
Either you're the murderer
of the Marquise of Rionero

148
00:16:34,315 --> 00:16:36,703
or you're keeping silent
so as not to compromise someone.

149
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:39,270
In either case...it's the gallows!

150
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:43,939
Unless you decide to take advantage
of the only way out

151
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,197
that's left to you.

152
00:16:48,691 --> 00:16:50,668
Try to understand me.

153
00:16:51,487 --> 00:16:52,815
Who were you with?

154
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,790
I have nothing to reveal.

155
00:16:55,176 --> 00:16:57,894
You said there was a witness
to the crime.

156
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,644
Show me to him.

157
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:01,830
Think about it...

158
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:06,190
that witness isn't able to face up
to a confrontation at the moment.

159
00:17:11,616 --> 00:17:13,484
Her pulse is good as well.

160
00:17:13,544 --> 00:17:15,980
But is it not strange
that she's sleeping so much?

161
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,473
It's a good thing.

162
00:17:17,533 --> 00:17:19,780
This means the delirium has finished.

163
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,035
Apart from anything else,
it's the first time she's rested

164
00:17:23,095 --> 00:17:24,912
since she had the brain fever.

165
00:17:31,145 --> 00:17:32,270
Mommy?

166
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:33,555
Beatrice!

167
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:36,886
Is that you, Dad?

168
00:17:36,946 --> 00:17:38,827
Yes, dear, it's me, yes.

169
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,593
I can't see you. Everything is dark.

170
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:57,493
But...

171
00:17:58,827 --> 00:17:59,796
this...

172
00:18:01,233 --> 00:18:02,270
..can you see it?

173
00:18:02,813 --> 00:18:05,033
No... I can't see anything.

174
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,038
Doctor!

175
00:18:15,403 --> 00:18:16,342
Blind?

176
00:18:27,761 --> 00:18:29,814
Isn't it wrong what we're doing?

177
00:18:30,353 --> 00:18:31,971
How can we keep silent?

178
00:18:32,031 --> 00:18:35,363
We have to. Ferdinando Maria Baldieri
is our leader,

179
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:38,764
and we don't have the right
to go against his plans.

180
00:18:38,824 --> 00:18:42,501
And will we save him by revealing
what we were doing that night?

181
00:18:42,561 --> 00:18:46,474
So we just have to watch him die,
stained by an unjust accusation?

182
00:18:46,898 --> 00:18:50,104
I can't keep quiet,
my conscience won't allow it.

183
00:18:50,164 --> 00:18:51,830
You have to keep quiet!

184
00:18:52,778 --> 00:18:56,488
If my father isn't speaking,
then we shouldn't either.

185
00:18:59,545 --> 00:19:01,184
But it's the scaffold.

186
00:19:10,913 --> 00:19:12,349
It's the scaffold!

187
00:19:16,339 --> 00:19:17,770
It's the scaffold!

188
00:19:23,323 --> 00:19:26,617
In the name of his Apostolic Majesty
Ferdinand ll,

189
00:19:26,758 --> 00:19:29,775
King of the Two Sicilies,
Cyprus and Jerusalem,

190
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:32,358
the Criminal High Court of Naples

191
00:19:32,522 --> 00:19:35,693
following the trial
of Ferdinando Maria Baldieri

192
00:19:35,867 --> 00:19:38,526
finds him guilty
of robbery and murder

193
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,851
and condemns him to be hanged
in the public square.

194
00:19:42,236 --> 00:19:44,212
My fate doesn't frighten me.

195
00:19:44,987 --> 00:19:46,590
I know I did my duty.

196
00:19:48,669 --> 00:19:52,186
The truth is born out of sacrifice.

197
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:57,504
I have one worry only...

198
00:19:58,542 --> 00:20:00,190
To leave you alone...

199
00:20:00,894 --> 00:20:02,812
But you'll feel me in your heart.

200
00:20:04,368 --> 00:20:06,980
I'll just be...a bit further away.

201
00:20:07,153 --> 00:20:08,290
Father!

202
00:20:08,984 --> 00:20:10,083
Be strong.

203
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,492
Farewell!

204
00:21:39,751 --> 00:21:43,430
In the name of his Apostolic Majesty
Ferdinand ll,

205
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:46,790
King of the Two Sicilies,
Cyprus and Jerusalem,

206
00:21:47,293 --> 00:21:49,583
the Criminal High Court of Naples

207
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:54,365
following the trial
of Ferdinando Maria Baldieri

208
00:21:54,774 --> 00:21:56,977
guilty of robbery and murder

209
00:21:57,037 --> 00:22:03,161
condemns him to be hanged
in the public square.

210
00:22:11,721 --> 00:22:13,668
An innocent man is dying!

211
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:20,677
Be brave!
The world is an unjust place.

212
00:22:21,438 --> 00:22:23,607
But in London
you'll rebuild your life,

213
00:22:23,963 --> 00:22:27,071
you'll complete your studies,
and maybe one day...

214
00:22:27,303 --> 00:22:30,591
And write to us.
Any time you need us...

215
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:31,744
Thank you.

216
00:23:39,103 --> 00:23:42,058
<i>He has to be tall, thin, fair...</i>

217
00:23:42,118 --> 00:23:43,302
<i>Why fair?</i>

218
00:23:43,362 --> 00:23:46,921
Because all the English are fair.
Naturally, he'll have glasses...

219
00:23:46,981 --> 00:23:47,904
Glasses?

220
00:23:47,964 --> 00:23:52,053
Of course! For a doctor, glasses are
like a thermometer, indispensable!

221
00:23:53,017 --> 00:23:55,809
We should go, I wouldn't want him
to arrive without us.

222
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:57,312
I have to do the honors
of the house.

223
00:23:57,372 --> 00:24:01,206
Let's go, then. But how will you
do him the honors of the house?

224
00:24:01,266 --> 00:24:03,030
You don't speak English!

225
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:07,651
Look!

226
00:24:09,492 --> 00:24:10,678
Oh, sorry...

227
00:24:16,629 --> 00:24:18,410
I copied it out of a grammar book.

228
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:21,236
The problem will be when he speaks
but I'll just keep saying all right!

229
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:25,063
It's a shame he's a doctor.

230
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,162
But it's still better
than a notary!

231
00:24:29,877 --> 00:24:32,889
Welcome back! You know
I nearly didn't recognize you?

232
00:24:32,949 --> 00:24:34,326
You're a man now!

233
00:24:34,386 --> 00:24:37,842
I'd hoped to return to my country
under my own name and head held high,

234
00:24:37,902 --> 00:24:40,499
yet here I am, Doctor Oliviero Simon!

235
00:24:40,644 --> 00:24:43,786
The famous Doctor Oliviero Simon,
you should say.

236
00:24:44,045 --> 00:24:47,435
Poor Sordi said, didn't he,
that you'd go far.

237
00:24:47,647 --> 00:24:49,257
Poor Sordi, of course.

238
00:24:49,459 --> 00:24:51,840
He ended up that way too, in jail.

239
00:24:53,205 --> 00:24:54,793
And you've settled in Sorrento?

240
00:24:54,853 --> 00:24:56,658
Yes, since I left teaching.

241
00:24:56,718 --> 00:24:58,576
I live here with Maria Luisa
and a nephew of mine.

242
00:24:58,636 --> 00:25:00,531
Your daughter will be a woman now!

243
00:25:00,591 --> 00:25:02,527
And how, what a woman!

244
00:25:02,587 --> 00:25:03,888
You'll meet her.

245
00:25:04,043 --> 00:25:07,031
Furthermore,
there's something of our past here.

246
00:25:07,532 --> 00:25:08,553
You see that villa?

247
00:25:08,613 --> 00:25:11,322
It belongs to the Marquis of Rionero.
He's lived here for years,

248
00:25:11,382 --> 00:25:14,036
doing nothing
but look after his daughter...

249
00:25:14,608 --> 00:25:16,266
..who never got better.

250
00:25:16,574 --> 00:25:20,430
The only person who saw the killer
and could have recognized him.

251
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:24,060
If I could restore her sight,
who knows...? - Exactly!

252
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,035
Or I wouldn't have insisted so much
on you coming back to ltaly!

253
00:25:27,095 --> 00:25:29,674
You're forgetting
whom I have to operate on.

254
00:25:29,734 --> 00:25:31,825
Will I keep my self confidence?

255
00:25:32,926 --> 00:25:34,999
Come, we'll talk about it later.

256
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:39,240
I'd recommend selling it, sir.

257
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:41,498
It's unproductive land.

258
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,335
We could use the proceeds
more profitably.

259
00:25:45,231 --> 00:25:46,581
I've received a few offers.

260
00:25:46,641 --> 00:25:50,331
Study them. You're my notary.
I trust you implicitly.

261
00:25:50,702 --> 00:25:51,686
Thank you.

262
00:25:51,938 --> 00:25:55,900
I know you are very fond of that land
and I didn't want...

263
00:25:56,203 --> 00:26:00,864
Yes, but my concern now
is to ensure Beatrice's future.

264
00:26:00,924 --> 00:26:03,273
That's my concern too.
- I know...

265
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:05,847
I know,
and I'm grateful to you for this.

266
00:26:05,937 --> 00:26:08,202
Well, then, if you'd like to sign...

267
00:26:38,301 --> 00:26:39,795
Well, how did it go?

268
00:26:40,035 --> 00:26:41,509
Wonderfully, Dad!

269
00:26:41,696 --> 00:26:43,929
Miss.
- Mr. Basileo, how are you?

270
00:26:44,161 --> 00:26:45,598
I need to go.

271
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,997
Be careful, don't get too worked up
over Doctor...

272
00:26:49,057 --> 00:26:50,070
Simon.

273
00:26:50,205 --> 00:26:52,596
If your cousin notices!
- That idiot?

274
00:26:52,656 --> 00:26:53,645
Goodbye!

275
00:26:58,389 --> 00:26:59,859
Sir....
- Miss?

276
00:27:00,069 --> 00:27:01,824
Did you remember my message?

277
00:27:01,884 --> 00:27:03,981
Of course. I've got the samples.

278
00:27:04,096 --> 00:27:06,735
Wait till you feel
how soft the material is.

279
00:27:06,795 --> 00:27:07,581
Come.

280
00:27:21,207 --> 00:27:22,440
Here they are.

281
00:27:27,544 --> 00:27:28,998
I hope you like them.

282
00:27:29,058 --> 00:27:31,346
I'm sorry to be a pest all the time.

283
00:27:31,703 --> 00:27:33,158
Why do you say that?

284
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:35,054
It was a pleasure for me.

285
00:27:36,028 --> 00:27:38,428
I'd like to help you all the time...

286
00:27:39,836 --> 00:27:42,024
..do something for you every day.

287
00:27:42,313 --> 00:27:44,880
You're too good.
I don't deserve this.

288
00:27:45,613 --> 00:27:46,558
Good?

289
00:27:46,827 --> 00:27:49,652
No, don't go. I love you, you know...

290
00:27:50,394 --> 00:27:53,489
and there's nothing in my love
that could offend you.

291
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:56,489
Because it's respect,
tenderness, devotion...

292
00:27:57,029 --> 00:28:00,153
And pity.
Say it, I won't be offended.

293
00:28:00,213 --> 00:28:02,573
Only one person would deserve pity...

294
00:28:02,872 --> 00:28:03,720
me...

295
00:28:04,212 --> 00:28:06,062
if this were just a dream.

296
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:08,840
Do you think
you can love a blind person?

297
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:12,113
No creature on Earth
can be loved more than you can!

298
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:14,879
Shall we go?

299
00:28:15,592 --> 00:28:16,430
Yes.

300
00:28:21,164 --> 00:28:22,369
Let's go.

301
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:29,281
I've told you a thousand times...

302
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:32,172
spero, promitto and iuro

303
00:28:32,364 --> 00:28:35,256
take the verb
in the future infinitive!

304
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,285
Take care of yourself.

305
00:28:38,326 --> 00:28:40,752
But when I'm trying
to teach you something,

306
00:28:40,812 --> 00:28:42,884
who knows what you're thinking?

307
00:28:43,086 --> 00:28:47,565
You...you know less than your cousin,
and that tells you everything!

308
00:28:47,787 --> 00:28:50,023
Because she knows nothing!

309
00:28:50,582 --> 00:28:53,271
On you go.
Translate this sentence for me.

310
00:28:54,349 --> 00:28:57,179
Caesar's legionnaires hoped

311
00:28:57,513 --> 00:29:00,090
to be able to break through...

312
00:29:01,098 --> 00:29:03,855
..the enemy wall.

313
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:08,991
Milites...

314
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,780
Milites...
Caesaris...

315
00:29:16,628 --> 00:29:17,544
Good.

316
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:19,430
..sperabant...

317
00:29:19,782 --> 00:29:20,725
Sperabant...

318
00:29:20,785 --> 00:29:21,944
Sperabant...

319
00:29:23,403 --> 00:29:24,453
sperabant...

320
00:29:24,617 --> 00:29:25,809
On you go.

321
00:29:25,963 --> 00:29:27,891
Ingressuros esse...

322
00:29:30,406 --> 00:29:31,790
..Valle d'Aosta...

323
00:29:32,908 --> 00:29:36,194
Ignoramus, ignoramus
and thrice ignoramus!

324
00:29:39,022 --> 00:29:43,265
There's something else to consider.
The marquis might find out who I am.

325
00:29:43,325 --> 00:29:47,440
And how? It's a secret known
only to the two of us. Therefore...

326
00:29:49,338 --> 00:29:50,796
<i>I'll do as you ask.</i>

327
00:29:52,213 --> 00:29:54,401
What, he doesn't speak English?

328
00:29:59,367 --> 00:30:01,410
He doesn't even have glasses!

329
00:30:02,152 --> 00:30:04,793
Here's the masterpiece
I told you about.

330
00:30:05,034 --> 00:30:06,300
Doctor Simon.

331
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,380
At last!
- You're starting up again?

332
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:30,421
Every time you go to Sorrento, you
never find the road back to Naples!

333
00:30:30,866 --> 00:30:33,119
I have my reasons, good ones.
You know that.

334
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:36,702
Oh, yes! If the marquis asks
to see the accounts,

335
00:30:36,762 --> 00:30:38,966
you'd end up in jail, I know!

336
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:43,535
And that's why you have to keep
in his good books...

337
00:30:43,999 --> 00:30:46,236
.. but especially in his daughter's!
- Stop it!

338
00:30:46,296 --> 00:30:47,188
No!
- Beware!

339
00:30:47,248 --> 00:30:49,428
That's what I'm telling you, beware!

340
00:30:49,488 --> 00:30:51,076
I know what you're aiming at,

341
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:53,264
but if you think
you can get rid of me, you're wrong!

342
00:30:53,324 --> 00:30:55,050
You still don't know me!

343
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:59,637
Come on! Do you think I could...?
- You could do anything!

344
00:31:00,347 --> 00:31:01,770
Unfortunately!

345
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,397
Even love you!

346
00:31:06,593 --> 00:31:08,550
Go back to your own house now.

347
00:31:09,012 --> 00:31:10,564
I'll come over later.

348
00:31:39,474 --> 00:31:42,227
The sacred armies
and the godly knight...

349
00:31:42,287 --> 00:31:44,272
All you did was look at him
at the table!

350
00:31:44,332 --> 00:31:46,739
..That the great sepulcher of Christ
did free, I sing...

351
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,145
You smiled at him three times.
- Six.

352
00:31:49,205 --> 00:31:51,846
Much wrought his valor
and foresight...

353
00:31:51,906 --> 00:31:54,487
You poured his drink for him too.
- And I drank from his glass!

354
00:31:54,547 --> 00:31:55,783
Ah, listen, this is cynicism!

355
00:31:55,843 --> 00:31:58,345
And in that glorious war
much suffered he...

356
00:31:58,405 --> 00:32:01,034
I said, cynicism!
- I heard!

357
00:32:01,094 --> 00:32:03,632
In vain 'gainst him
did Hell oppose her might.

358
00:32:03,692 --> 00:32:05,793
I'm going
so as not to be compromised.

359
00:32:05,853 --> 00:32:07,629
Shall I keep you company?

360
00:32:10,409 --> 00:32:11,537
Maria Luisa?

361
00:32:13,942 --> 00:32:15,067
Maria Luisa?

362
00:32:15,215 --> 00:32:17,451
She's upstairs, shall I call her?

363
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:20,180
No, thank you, I'll go.

364
00:32:21,204 --> 00:32:22,996
Miss di Rionero?
- Yes.

365
00:32:23,724 --> 00:32:25,039
I'm Doctor Simon.

366
00:32:25,099 --> 00:32:27,938
Ah! Maria Luisa has spoken to me
a lot about you.

367
00:32:27,998 --> 00:32:28,927
Sit down.

368
00:32:28,987 --> 00:32:30,811
I wouldn't want to disturb you.

369
00:32:30,871 --> 00:32:33,628
Not at all! Professor Morisoni
will have told you...?

370
00:32:33,688 --> 00:32:34,553
Yes.

371
00:32:41,849 --> 00:32:44,104
You know we have to become friends.

372
00:32:44,687 --> 00:32:46,708
And you think he could do it?

373
00:32:46,937 --> 00:32:48,631
I trust him completely.

374
00:32:48,691 --> 00:32:52,163
His first attempts, I'll say,
left me a little skeptical,

375
00:32:52,442 --> 00:32:54,854
but then I had to acknowledge
the evidence.

376
00:32:54,914 --> 00:32:57,362
Today,
the eye can be operated on too.

377
00:32:57,641 --> 00:32:59,945
We've been left behind now.

378
00:33:00,292 --> 00:33:04,119
Excuse me if I insist, but don't you
remember what you felt then?

379
00:33:04,246 --> 00:33:06,546
Nothing, I don't remember anything.

380
00:33:07,531 --> 00:33:09,247
I was scared senseless.

381
00:33:09,584 --> 00:33:12,149
My mother,
thrown against the pillows...

382
00:33:12,209 --> 00:33:14,257
the killer's hands
squeezing her throat...

383
00:33:14,317 --> 00:33:16,332
And could you see the killer?

384
00:33:16,392 --> 00:33:17,201
No...

385
00:33:17,874 --> 00:33:20,647
the room was dark...
All I could see was a shadow.

386
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:23,008
Try to remember!
- It's useless.

387
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:25,861
The only two things I'll never forget...

388
00:33:26,565 --> 00:33:28,843
..are my mother's lifeless face...

389
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:32,436
..and the killer's eyes!
- His eyes? - Yes...

390
00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:35,664
He had the eyes of a wild animal,
horrible!

391
00:33:35,724 --> 00:33:37,893
And nothing else,
only his eyes?

392
00:33:37,953 --> 00:33:40,664
That's all.
- Try! Concentrate!

393
00:33:40,915 --> 00:33:43,301
It's useless!
- It's essential! You must!

394
00:33:43,361 --> 00:33:44,349
Doctor!

395
00:33:48,646 --> 00:33:49,713
Excuse me...

396
00:33:50,227 --> 00:33:52,247
I didn't want to frighten you.

397
00:33:56,227 --> 00:33:57,345
Come.

398
00:33:57,592 --> 00:33:59,078
Let me look at you.

399
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,160
Raise your head.

400
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:21,950
Try to keep them open.

401
00:34:22,246 --> 00:34:24,011
Do you feel them burning?

402
00:34:24,071 --> 00:34:25,299
A little.

403
00:34:25,627 --> 00:34:27,901
Two drops
and that'll be it for today.

404
00:34:29,175 --> 00:34:30,412
Keep still.

405
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,790
No, don't be afraid.

406
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:41,363
There, that's it done.

407
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,204
Remember, don't go out right away.

408
00:34:44,264 --> 00:34:46,181
Shall we stay shut in here for long?

409
00:34:46,241 --> 00:34:48,264
You can go to your lessons,
if you like.

410
00:34:48,324 --> 00:34:50,296
Do you care?
- Not for me...

411
00:34:53,827 --> 00:34:55,157
.. but for your cousin.

412
00:35:26,132 --> 00:35:27,472
He's down, huh?

413
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,698
Till later.

414
00:35:32,128 --> 00:35:35,724
Don't be late, I'll be waiting for you.
- You can rely on me.

415
00:35:45,815 --> 00:35:46,997
He's so good.

416
00:35:47,095 --> 00:35:48,678
Especially with you.

417
00:35:48,804 --> 00:35:50,883
Do you think so?
- Absolutely!

418
00:35:53,061 --> 00:35:55,689
Dr Simon seems to me
to be something of a charlatan!

419
00:35:55,749 --> 00:35:59,809
Don't you think your judgment
might not be entirely disinterested?

420
00:36:00,146 --> 00:36:01,601
What do you mean?

421
00:36:01,957 --> 00:36:03,442
You understood me.

422
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:05,533
No, sir.

423
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:08,553
Illustrious clinicians
who cure a case of blindness

424
00:36:08,613 --> 00:36:12,331
with sailing trips and romantic walks
don't convince me.

425
00:36:16,557 --> 00:36:19,883
MUSlC: "Dorme Surriento"
by Carlo Buti

426
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:16,399
Are you tired?
- No...

427
00:37:16,748 --> 00:37:19,736
I was listening.
- You like these songs of ours?

428
00:37:19,796 --> 00:37:20,946
Very much.

429
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:23,685
That's unusual for an Englishman.

430
00:37:26,115 --> 00:37:28,075
Why don't you come nearer?

431
00:37:54,033 --> 00:37:56,025
This sea must be so beautiful.

432
00:37:56,536 --> 00:37:57,756
It's magnificent.

433
00:37:57,816 --> 00:37:59,259
You love it too?

434
00:38:00,401 --> 00:38:01,548
Very much.

435
00:38:02,898 --> 00:38:04,797
If only I could see it again...

436
00:38:04,857 --> 00:38:06,079
You will.

437
00:38:06,715 --> 00:38:09,079
Do you think so?
- I'm sure of it.

438
00:38:21,255 --> 00:38:23,279
We need to head back to land.

439
00:38:23,491 --> 00:38:24,590
It's late.

440
00:38:34,133 --> 00:38:35,818
It's indispensable, believe me.

441
00:38:35,878 --> 00:38:38,793
I need to bring the operation
forward, I have to go back to London.

442
00:38:38,853 --> 00:38:39,924
But why?

443
00:38:41,662 --> 00:38:45,547
I feel that for Beatrice
I'm not simply her doctor any more.

444
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:48,577
And this frightens me...

445
00:38:49,401 --> 00:38:51,232
I'm frightened of myself.

446
00:38:53,285 --> 00:38:56,829
I'm condemned now
to being Oliviero Simon for ever.

447
00:38:58,593 --> 00:39:02,939
The murderer had a formidable ally,
time...and Beatrice.

448
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:24,485
Is that you, Oliviero?

449
00:39:26,229 --> 00:39:27,489
It's me, Miss.

450
00:39:33,744 --> 00:39:35,447
And I hope my company

451
00:39:35,702 --> 00:39:37,881
won't make you pine for the doctor.

452
00:39:37,941 --> 00:39:39,179
Of course not!

453
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:45,880
Why have you changed so much with me?

454
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,723
I haven't changed at all!

455
00:39:47,783 --> 00:39:48,882
Excuse me.

456
00:40:03,742 --> 00:40:05,734
Today is the last medication.

457
00:40:05,878 --> 00:40:08,052
Then two days' rest and then...

458
00:40:08,148 --> 00:40:10,141
<i>So you've decided to operate?</i>

459
00:40:16,309 --> 00:40:17,263
Yes.

460
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,366
Is the young lady there?

461
00:40:19,426 --> 00:40:20,872
Let's go, then.

462
00:40:31,425 --> 00:40:34,462
I don't understand you.
You shouldn't behave like that.

463
00:40:34,522 --> 00:40:36,381
Sir, don't misunderstand me.

464
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:40,470
Have you thought of the consequences
of an operation like this?

465
00:40:40,655 --> 00:40:43,720
What if, instead of curing her,
he disfigures her?

466
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:48,358
No, no,
this is an obsession of yours!

467
00:41:11,542 --> 00:41:13,560
Dear Anna,
the situation is becoming dangerous.

468
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,640
Beatrice
is going to have the operation.

469
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:18,148
It's necessary that I stay on
in Sorrento. I have to try something.

470
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:21,331
I'll keep you informed about
what's happening. A big hug, Ernesto.

471
00:41:42,063 --> 00:41:43,477
What's going on?

472
00:41:46,746 --> 00:41:48,867
Someone missed their target.

473
00:41:54,664 --> 00:41:58,124
Or someone wants to do away with you.

474
00:42:29,681 --> 00:42:31,541
Maria Luisa!
<i>- Here I am!</i>

475
00:42:31,792 --> 00:42:33,150
Professor!

476
00:42:36,858 --> 00:42:38,067
Don't worry.

477
00:42:56,084 --> 00:42:58,233
Madam Anna is here to see you.

478
00:42:58,686 --> 00:43:00,184
In the other room?

479
00:43:12,991 --> 00:43:15,948
I'm very grateful to you,
but how did you find out?

480
00:43:16,008 --> 00:43:18,225
The notary told me.

481
00:43:19,767 --> 00:43:22,555
Can I see the young lady?
Has she had the operation?

482
00:43:22,615 --> 00:43:24,626
They're operating on her now.

483
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:30,221
Well done! You really were brave.

484
00:43:30,693 --> 00:43:34,144
I was right to tell you
there was no need to be so alarmed.

485
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,978
And now a few more days in the dark
and then...

486
00:43:38,151 --> 00:43:39,375
the miracle!

487
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,758
Beatrice!

488
00:43:43,317 --> 00:43:44,012
Dad!

489
00:43:44,112 --> 00:43:46,011
Was it painful?
- No.

490
00:43:46,939 --> 00:43:48,872
Can I say hello as well, Miss?

491
00:43:48,932 --> 00:43:50,602
Who is it?
- Mrs. Anna.

492
00:43:51,095 --> 00:43:53,033
You came too? Thank you.

493
00:43:53,264 --> 00:43:54,778
<i>It's nothing, dear.</i>

494
00:43:55,116 --> 00:43:58,873
<i>The notary has been kind enough
to keep me up to date about you.</i>

495
00:43:58,933 --> 00:44:00,636
<i>I wish you all the best.</i>

496
00:44:00,696 --> 00:44:02,051
How do you feel?

497
00:44:02,263 --> 00:44:04,119
I'm still a bit befuddled.

498
00:44:04,331 --> 00:44:07,126
That'll pass in a few hours.
Try to relax.

499
00:44:07,464 --> 00:44:09,627
I'm going to prepare you a tonic.

500
00:44:10,054 --> 00:44:12,955
Leave her in peace, let her breathe!

501
00:44:13,174 --> 00:44:15,140
<i>Maria Luisa, give me a hand.</i>

502
00:44:16,225 --> 00:44:17,622
You go as well.

503
00:44:18,075 --> 00:44:19,762
I didn't disfigure her!

504
00:44:20,121 --> 00:44:22,838
<i>Let's sort her out a bit better.
There...</i>

505
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,180
<i>That's the way.</i>

506
00:44:26,207 --> 00:44:29,262
<i>And now puff up the pillows...</i>

507
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:32,178
<i>and Lady Beatrice is served!</i>

508
00:44:33,118 --> 00:44:33,966
<i>There!</i>

509
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:05,379
Who's that?

510
00:45:05,439 --> 00:45:07,292
It's that idiot Giovannino!

511
00:45:07,793 --> 00:45:11,345
I have to go down. He's capable
of whistling all night long.

512
00:45:11,477 --> 00:45:12,630
Quiet, now.

513
00:45:34,257 --> 00:45:38,122
As soon as you like to stop, feel free!
- You'll be served.

514
00:45:38,393 --> 00:45:41,676
I don't know how I'm holding back...!
What do you want?

515
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:44,391
I wanted to see you.
I couldn't sleep.

516
00:45:44,451 --> 00:45:47,605
If you can't sleep, take some opium,
and remember...

517
00:46:22,537 --> 00:46:23,671
<i>You'll leave tomorrow!</i>

518
00:46:23,731 --> 00:46:25,783
<i>That would suit you, but I'm staying.</i>

519
00:46:25,843 --> 00:46:27,198
<i>You have to go!
- No!</i>

520
00:46:27,258 --> 00:46:29,930
<i>Don't you see you'll ruin me?
- I don't care! And it's not true!</i>

521
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:32,950
<i>How isn't it true?
- That's not what's worrying you!</i>

522
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:36,261
It's something else,
but you won't make it, I promise you!

523
00:46:36,321 --> 00:46:38,454
I've understood
and you won't make it!

524
00:46:38,514 --> 00:46:39,948
You've understood?

525
00:46:40,825 --> 00:46:41,885
All the better!

526
00:46:46,425 --> 00:46:48,993
It's Beatrice I'm interested in.
I won't give her up.

527
00:46:49,053 --> 00:46:51,076
Beware!
- What will you do?

528
00:46:53,865 --> 00:46:54,951
Listen...

529
00:46:55,454 --> 00:46:57,680
I didn't report you
when I should have...

530
00:46:57,910 --> 00:47:00,044
I stood beside you
in all your sordid dealings.

531
00:47:00,104 --> 00:47:02,412
Stop it!
- I was your accomplice!

532
00:47:02,807 --> 00:47:05,389
I let someone else go to the scaffold
instead of you!

533
00:47:05,449 --> 00:47:07,091
Stop it!
- But not this time, no!

534
00:47:07,151 --> 00:47:09,835
Not Beatrice,
or I'll send you to jail!

535
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:13,069
Don't you feel the horror
of what you're thinking of doing?

536
00:47:13,129 --> 00:47:15,127
I'll tell her what you are...!

537
00:47:20,997 --> 00:47:22,198
Just try!

538
00:47:22,418 --> 00:47:23,585
You scoundrel!

539
00:47:28,329 --> 00:47:29,350
Scoundrel!

540
00:47:29,643 --> 00:47:31,297
And then?
<i>- And then,..</i>

541
00:47:31,357 --> 00:47:34,249
<i>he grabbed her
and told her again to go away.</i>

542
00:47:35,011 --> 00:47:39,208
Yes, but Anna kept saying no. So
he left without even turning round.

543
00:47:47,657 --> 00:47:49,530
But...children...

544
00:47:50,345 --> 00:47:52,443
are you sure you heard properly?

545
00:47:52,684 --> 00:47:54,105
<i>Well,
ask her.</i>

546
00:47:55,095 --> 00:47:55,886
<i>Yes.</i>

547
00:48:05,367 --> 00:48:08,046
And you haven't told anybody?
<i>- Nobody!</i>

548
00:48:08,249 --> 00:48:09,348
I mean it...

549
00:48:09,666 --> 00:48:11,755
don't say anything to anyone!

550
00:48:15,049 --> 00:48:15,894
Come in.

551
00:48:16,392 --> 00:48:17,613
Shall we go?

552
00:48:26,152 --> 00:48:29,591
Listen, Professor, I'd like you
to remove the bandages from Beatrice.

553
00:48:29,651 --> 00:48:30,930
What?
- I'm leaving.

554
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:33,945
You're leaving?
- It's best she doesn't see me.

555
00:48:36,173 --> 00:48:37,084
But...

556
00:48:37,923 --> 00:48:39,976
if you were still needed here?

557
00:48:46,178 --> 00:48:47,239
Listen...

558
00:48:47,865 --> 00:48:50,159
if you want, I'll go alone now...

559
00:48:51,075 --> 00:48:53,440
.. but you have to stay here.

560
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:56,792
Look at me carefully.

561
00:48:57,577 --> 00:48:59,061
You must!
- Why?

562
00:49:01,386 --> 00:49:03,101
Don't ask me anything...

563
00:49:03,371 --> 00:49:06,456
wait,
who knows what we're dealing with?

564
00:49:07,473 --> 00:49:09,625
You have the duty to speak, Madam.

565
00:49:09,993 --> 00:49:13,461
I don't condemn your feelings,
I might even understand them,

566
00:49:13,521 --> 00:49:16,424
but if there's a secret
behind your passion,

567
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:20,818
if you've sealed it up all this time
and someone suffers because of this,

568
00:49:20,878 --> 00:49:22,670
then you have to speak!

569
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,663
I have no secret to reveal.

570
00:49:24,723 --> 00:49:28,130
Why do you want me to remind you
of what I heard last night?

571
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:30,846
And if you heard it,
why are you asking me?

572
00:49:31,058 --> 00:49:32,820
What kind of woman are you?

573
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,342
You've been covering
this man's wickedness for ten years!

574
00:49:35,402 --> 00:49:36,444
It's not true!
- You're his accomplice!

575
00:49:36,504 --> 00:49:39,544
No!
- Even now as he slips away from you!

576
00:49:39,934 --> 00:49:43,688
He won't slip away from me

- And if I could assure you of that?

577
00:49:46,044 --> 00:49:47,027
Answer me!

578
00:49:48,728 --> 00:49:49,692
Well?

579
00:49:53,188 --> 00:49:54,991
I'd have lost everything.

580
00:50:01,113 --> 00:50:02,694
All right, remember...

581
00:50:02,974 --> 00:50:05,935
no fuss, no fainting...

582
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:07,853
and no tears!

583
00:50:41,798 --> 00:50:43,041
Do they hurt?

584
00:50:45,082 --> 00:50:46,114
No!

585
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:48,523
Open the shutters...

586
00:50:49,487 --> 00:50:50,515
..slowly.

587
00:51:05,377 --> 00:51:06,948
Try to open your eyes.

588
00:51:07,863 --> 00:51:09,137
Don't be scared.

589
00:51:37,737 --> 00:51:38,981
I can see!

590
00:51:39,641 --> 00:51:40,942
I can see...!

591
00:51:43,143 --> 00:51:44,245
I can see!

592
00:51:45,554 --> 00:51:46,826
I can see...!

593
00:51:53,881 --> 00:51:54,960
I can see!

594
00:51:56,377 --> 00:51:58,391
I can see!
- Oh, my girl!

595
00:51:58,661 --> 00:51:59,740
Dad!

596
00:52:00,711 --> 00:52:01,742
I can see!

597
00:52:03,047 --> 00:52:04,056
I can see!

598
00:52:05,292 --> 00:52:06,943
Professor, thank you!

599
00:52:17,338 --> 00:52:18,556
Doctor Simon?

600
00:52:41,443 --> 00:52:43,521
But what did I do to him, what?

601
00:52:43,895 --> 00:52:45,956
Why don't you ask him?
- Me...?

602
00:52:46,554 --> 00:52:49,376
You're right, I can ask him.
- Maria Luisa, no!

603
00:52:49,436 --> 00:52:50,805
Yes, don't worry.

604
00:52:55,751 --> 00:52:56,715
Come in.

605
00:52:58,718 --> 00:53:01,398
Am I interrupting anything?
- Not at all.

606
00:53:01,744 --> 00:53:03,816
I'm always delighted to see you.

607
00:53:04,641 --> 00:53:06,528
So, you're leaving?
- Yes.

608
00:53:06,588 --> 00:53:07,455
Great!

609
00:53:07,619 --> 00:53:12,591
Well, I just have time to tell you that
your English ways are quite unseemly.

610
00:53:12,651 --> 00:53:14,785
My English ways?
- Yes, you understood me.

611
00:53:14,845 --> 00:53:17,699
And don't tell me you didn't notice
because I won't believe you!

612
00:53:17,759 --> 00:53:19,738
What are you talking about?
- Beatrice.

613
00:53:19,798 --> 00:53:23,420
If you'd tried it with me,
it would've been fine, I know men!

614
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,102
But taking advantage of that poor thing!

615
00:53:25,162 --> 00:53:27,019
Taking advantage?
There must be some misunderstanding!

616
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:30,312
A misunderstanding? Making a girl
fall for you, then leaving her?

617
00:53:30,372 --> 00:53:32,827
But l...
- Never mind! I could see, you know!

618
00:53:32,887 --> 00:53:36,391
Would you have the courage to tell
Beatrice it was a misunderstanding?

619
00:53:36,451 --> 00:53:37,478
Answer me!

620
00:53:38,612 --> 00:53:41,153
If it were necessary.
- Let's go then!

621
00:53:43,193 --> 00:53:45,497
You can start by taking this off.

622
00:53:45,725 --> 00:53:48,597
You can put it back on later...
if you need to.

623
00:54:23,143 --> 00:54:25,515
Here he is! You deal with her now.

624
00:54:40,535 --> 00:54:44,409
Why didn't you want to take my
bandages off? What did I do to you?

625
00:54:44,669 --> 00:54:48,949
Nothing. My presence was no longer
indispensable. My job was done.

626
00:54:49,009 --> 00:54:49,905
Done?

627
00:54:50,194 --> 00:54:52,796
Yes, in fact I wanted to leave.
- Leave?

628
00:54:53,397 --> 00:54:57,175
Without even letting me thank you?
Without saying goodbye to me?

629
00:54:57,407 --> 00:54:59,886
Forgetting that...
- Forgetting what?

630
00:55:02,594 --> 00:55:06,087
I needed your trust,
and I needed to inspire trust in you.

631
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:14,261
So, even that kiss
is part of your professional expertise?

632
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,468
Excuse me...

633
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,557
I'm really grateful anyway...

634
00:55:30,617 --> 00:55:34,159
and... I'll see you again
before you leave...won't l?

635
00:55:35,084 --> 00:55:37,070
Goodbye, then, and thank you.

636
00:56:16,888 --> 00:56:18,622
Mr. Basileo...
- Miss?

637
00:56:18,682 --> 00:56:22,989
Come, I have some very exciting news
for you, you'll be very pleased.

638
00:56:23,221 --> 00:56:24,088
Come.

639
00:56:38,397 --> 00:56:40,662
I wanted to ask you a favor, sir...

640
00:56:41,269 --> 00:56:43,828
I absolutely have to get back
to Naples this evening.

641
00:56:43,888 --> 00:56:45,625
Could I use your coach?

642
00:56:45,962 --> 00:56:48,329
Of course. I'm only sorry...

643
00:56:48,389 --> 00:56:50,492
So am l, but it's unavoidable.

644
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:52,138
At what time?

645
00:56:52,198 --> 00:56:54,014
I'm not sure... At eight?

646
00:56:54,264 --> 00:56:55,305
All right.

647
00:57:05,376 --> 00:57:08,190
Aren't you happy?
I'll get out of your way.

648
00:57:09,491 --> 00:57:11,363
You've achieved your aim.

649
00:57:11,989 --> 00:57:13,686
You'll marry Beatrice...

650
00:57:13,936 --> 00:57:17,241
I could have betrayed you or myself
if I'd stayed here.

651
00:57:18,504 --> 00:57:20,819
I'll go.
- What do you plan to do?

652
00:57:21,069 --> 00:57:25,121
You're not laying a trap for me?
- A trap? No... I'm moving aside!

653
00:57:25,181 --> 00:57:26,926
Anna, you know me.

654
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:29,240
Oh, don't worry.

655
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,954
The last thing I want
is to be shot at too!

656
00:57:47,299 --> 00:57:50,930
I don't understand this sudden
and unexplained departure of Anna.

657
00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:52,317
I do!
- You do?

658
00:57:53,175 --> 00:57:55,616
I mean, no...
I don't understand it either.

659
00:57:55,676 --> 00:57:58,190
But lots of strange things
happen here.

660
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:00,938
Doctor Simon
isn't leaving now either.

661
00:58:05,426 --> 00:58:07,758
Will your fiancé be long in Naples?

662
00:58:08,423 --> 00:58:09,227
No...

663
00:58:09,657 --> 00:58:11,035
I don't think so.

664
00:58:13,118 --> 00:58:15,325
<i>Here, this is it, isn't it, Anna?</i>

665
00:58:16,333 --> 00:58:18,163
It's ideal for an engagement.

666
00:58:18,223 --> 00:58:20,194
That would be my choice too.

667
00:58:21,186 --> 00:58:23,779
For the payment...
- Oh, please, sir!

668
00:58:24,179 --> 00:58:26,359
And my very best wishes.
- Thank you.

669
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:28,488
I'll see you out.
- Thank you.

670
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:40,536
You'll see,
we'll be happy all the same.

671
00:58:42,114 --> 00:58:44,248
Don't you think it's a bit late?

672
00:58:45,264 --> 00:58:46,816
You have to set off.

673
00:58:47,645 --> 00:58:50,710
I understand. You want to go?
- No, it's not that.

674
00:58:54,061 --> 00:58:55,642
Farewell.
- Farewell?

675
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,185
See you again!

676
00:58:59,530 --> 00:59:00,462
Maybe.

677
00:59:25,846 --> 00:59:28,507
Like this?
- No, they're better like this.

678
00:59:29,981 --> 00:59:31,508
You're so beautiful!

679
00:59:31,846 --> 00:59:35,788
That dear Doctor Simon!
He has to die of jealousy!

680
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,096
Simon?

681
00:59:38,198 --> 00:59:40,151
What does he care about me?

682
01:00:00,145 --> 01:00:02,715
You should have let me leave,
Professor!

683
01:00:03,076 --> 01:00:04,098
No...

684
01:00:07,107 --> 01:00:08,158
No!

685
01:00:19,769 --> 01:00:22,921
All the best!
I hope to be as happy as you one day.

686
01:00:22,981 --> 01:00:25,094
Thank you, my dears, thank you.

687
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,146
Sir!
- Aren't you dancing?

688
01:00:40,953 --> 01:00:43,449
May I have the pleasure
of this dance?

689
01:01:07,089 --> 01:01:10,858
"Sir"? Aren't you able to call me
by any other name?

690
01:01:11,530 --> 01:01:14,122
Perhaps this is something
I will manage with time.

691
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:15,974
I must manage it.

692
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:39,198
Are you tired?

693
01:02:39,574 --> 01:02:40,374
No.

694
01:02:42,529 --> 01:02:44,062
May l?
- Thank you.

695
01:02:54,124 --> 01:02:55,801
Who gave you this ring?

696
01:02:55,965 --> 01:02:56,872
Why?

697
01:02:57,441 --> 01:02:59,455
This ring belonged to my wife!

698
01:02:59,783 --> 01:03:03,478
It was stolen along with some
other jewelry that tragic night.

699
01:03:04,625 --> 01:03:06,726
How did it end up in your hands?

700
01:03:08,770 --> 01:03:10,393
Who gave it to you?

701
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:12,851
Answer me!

702
01:03:14,711 --> 01:03:16,195
<i>Who gave it to you?</i>

703
01:03:16,995 --> 01:03:19,316
I... I don't know...

704
01:03:20,521 --> 01:03:23,092
I don't know,
I've never seen this ring before...

705
01:03:23,152 --> 01:03:24,686
I never had it...

706
01:03:25,894 --> 01:03:28,603
A short while ago,
there was a different one in the box.

707
01:03:28,663 --> 01:03:30,041
I looked at it...

708
01:03:30,101 --> 01:03:31,551
there, in my room...

709
01:03:32,489 --> 01:03:34,520
Someone has replaced it ...

710
01:03:35,370 --> 01:03:37,047
Who could it have been?

711
01:03:37,452 --> 01:03:38,209
Who?

712
01:03:41,451 --> 01:03:42,280
Who?

713
01:03:42,676 --> 01:03:43,668
<i>Me!</i>

714
01:04:01,897 --> 01:04:02,867
You...?

715
01:04:04,427 --> 01:04:05,352
You?

716
01:04:12,627 --> 01:04:13,823
His eyes!

717
01:04:14,758 --> 01:04:15,994
The murderer!

718
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:18,076
The murderer...!

719
01:04:26,014 --> 01:04:28,990
In the name of his Apostolic Majesty
Ferdinand ll,

720
01:04:29,050 --> 01:04:31,843
King of the Two Sicilies,
Cyprus and Jerusalem,

721
01:04:31,903 --> 01:04:33,952
the Criminal High Court of Naples

722
01:04:34,012 --> 01:04:36,479
following the trial
of Ernesto Basileo

723
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:39,170
finds him guilty
of robbery and murder

724
01:04:39,230 --> 01:04:42,756
and condemns him to be hanged
in the public square.

725
01:04:47,227 --> 01:04:49,993
There's one thing
I can't forgive you for,..

726
01:04:50,379 --> 01:04:53,880
not telling me Ferdinando Maria
Baldieri was innocent.

727
01:04:54,423 --> 01:04:56,579
I didn't have the right to do so.

728
01:04:56,908 --> 01:05:00,513
In any case, Ferdinando Maria Baldieri
himself chose sacrifice..

729
01:05:00,573 --> 01:05:03,753
over betraying our cause
and his companions.

730
01:05:05,665 --> 01:05:08,871
We had faith that time
would have done him justice.

731
01:05:09,347 --> 01:05:10,609
And, indeed...

732
01:05:11,606 --> 01:05:13,917
everything comes out in the end.

733
01:05:18,783 --> 01:05:20,229
lndeed!
- What?

734
01:05:21,072 --> 01:05:22,052
Look!

735
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:33,353
What a rascal!

736
01:05:33,413 --> 01:05:35,829
No, leave them be!

737
01:05:36,302 --> 01:05:39,823
Anyway, they're being set
a bad example by them down there.
