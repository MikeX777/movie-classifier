1
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,394
Modern art.

2
00:00:19,395 --> 00:00:21,439
Yes, ladies and gentlemen.

3
00:00:21,898 --> 00:00:24,691
Until the National Socialists
came to power,

4
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:29,947
Germany had such a thing as "modern" art,
which means...

5
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,329
as one can conclude from the very name,
a different kind of art every year.

6
00:00:37,455 --> 00:00:41,124
What National Socialism wants
is a return to German art,

7
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:45,837
which like all the creative values
of a people,

8
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:47,382
must be based on timeless values.

9
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:52,302
But if it no longer represents
these timeless values for our people,

10
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:57,140
then it is without value even today.

11
00:00:57,141 --> 00:00:59,935
THE WORLD IS ONE BIG BROTHEL

12
00:00:59,936 --> 00:01:05,817
German women are mocked
and depicted as prostitutes.

13
00:01:06,818 --> 00:01:10,613
Soldiers are presented as murderers
or the victims of senseless slaughter

14
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:14,950
in line with what they call
the "Bolshevik class struggle."

15
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:20,622
Every attempt is made to eradicate
from our hearts the deep-rooted respect

16
00:01:20,623 --> 00:01:22,625
we naturally have for a soldier's courage.

17
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:29,048
And madness, mental illness,
is elevated to a defining principle.

18
00:01:31,217 --> 00:01:36,973
Must one really assume that there are men
who actually see their compatriots

19
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,182
only as degenerate cretins?

20
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:42,894
People who see fields as blue,
the sky as green

21
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:46,065
and clouds as sulfur yellow?

22
00:01:46,816 --> 00:01:50,278
They would, of course,
insist I not say "see," but "perceive."

23
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:52,988
There are only two possibilities.

24
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:56,242
Either these so-called "artists"

25
00:01:56,701 --> 00:01:58,577
really do see things that way

26
00:01:58,578 --> 00:02:01,122
and consequently
believe in what they depict.

27
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:06,084
Here it would be important
to determine whether their flawed vision

28
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:09,088
is the result of an accident
or of hereditary disease.

29
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:14,259
In the former case, regrettable
for these unfortunate individuals.

30
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,763
In the latter, information
for the Reich Ministry of the Interior,

31
00:02:17,764 --> 00:02:21,892
which could at least ensure
that such a gruesome ocular affliction

32
00:02:21,893 --> 00:02:26,355
is not passed on to future generations.

33
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:28,356
The other possibility

34
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:32,779
is that they themselves do not believe
in the reality of what they depict,

35
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:35,573
but have other motives

36
00:02:36,115 --> 00:02:38,951
for pestering the nation
with this nonsense.

37
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,956
In that case, such transgressions fall
within the realm of criminal activity.

38
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,502
What does this have to do with art?

39
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:52,255
How does it elevate the soul?
How does it show artistic ability?

40
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:54,550
For to produce art, one must be an artist.

41
00:02:57,512 --> 00:02:59,555
I think you're artist enough
to do this too.

42
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:06,729
Yes, you certainly could. Have a go.

43
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:12,652
And when you've finished, ask your parents
if they'll give you ten cents for it.

44
00:03:14,737 --> 00:03:18,991
Would you like to know how much they paid
Mr. Vastly Kandinsky for this?

45
00:03:19,826 --> 00:03:21,285
2,000 marks.

46
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:24,664
More than a year's wages
for a German worker.

47
00:03:25,456 --> 00:03:26,666
What does your dad do?

48
00:03:28,084 --> 00:03:30,002
He doesn't have a job right now.

49
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:37,885
2,000 marks taken from taxes
paid by the working German population.

50
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:46,060
We have seen to it here that the people...

51
00:03:53,568 --> 00:03:56,320
Maybe I don't want
to be a painter after all.

52
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,617
Don't tell anybody, but I like it.

53
00:04:10,877 --> 00:04:12,879
"DEGENERATE ART" EXHIBITION

54
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:21,929
Aunt Elisabeth,
did you see the way they looked at you?

55
00:04:22,847 --> 00:04:25,181
On Monday,
nobody here will have eyes for me.

56
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,184
They'll all be cheering the fuhrer.

57
00:04:28,436 --> 00:04:30,980
- Good day.
- I think you're better than Hitler.

58
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:36,109
- Good day.
- Good day, young lady.

59
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,321
You took your nephew on an outing.

60
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:40,031
- Yes.
- Thank you.

61
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,912
- I wish you a pleasant ride.
- Thank you.

62
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,763
Over there,
that's where our apartment was.

63
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:10,311
What do you miss most about Dresden?

64
00:05:14,732 --> 00:05:16,734
Sometimes it helps to talk about it.

65
00:05:22,198 --> 00:05:24,115
I know who you miss most!

66
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:26,452
That little girl with the red braids.

67
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:30,122
What was her name again? Johanna?

68
00:05:30,623 --> 00:05:33,792
Johanna, right? Your beloved. Right?

69
00:05:33,793 --> 00:05:35,336
Not only Johanna.

70
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,547
- Who else do you miss?
- The Schréders.

71
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:42,218
You know, the old couple in our building.

72
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:46,597
The ones that always hold hands
like little kids.

73
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:47,932
I like them.

74
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:50,308
And their dachshund, Thilo.

75
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:53,604
He always comes to me
when I call his name.

76
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:01,153
It's only 45 kilometers from us
to Dresden.

77
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:03,906
You'll be able to visit them
as often as you like.

78
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:18,713
But you're right.
Dresden is unbeatable in its beauty.

79
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:41,485
You know what?

80
00:06:42,695 --> 00:06:45,656
I find your father very strong
for not joining the Nazi Party.

81
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:48,283
One signature,

82
00:06:48,284 --> 00:06:51,203
he could have kept his teaching job
and the apartment.

83
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:55,708
He says it's criminal, the way the Nazis...

84
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:59,795
I know. You don't talk like this
to anyone else, do you?

85
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:03,590
Mama says she'll get him to join anyways.

86
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:06,510
After the war,
being a member will be his capitol.

87
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:08,554
That's "capital"!

88
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:44,714
- Good-bye, Miss May.
- Good-bye.

89
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:46,008
Good-bye.

90
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:13,410
Hold this for a moment.

91
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,539
Did you forget something, Aunt Elisabeth?

92
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:29,718
Hey, Eddie. The May girl is here again.

93
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:31,719
Let's make her happy.

94
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,222
- Kai?
- Ready.

95
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:36,266
- Good.
- All at the same time.

96
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:40,604
Good. On the count of three.
One... two... three.

97
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:45,085
Take care.

98
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:48,589
Thank you.

99
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,515
To paint a picture
which makes you feel that way.

100
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:02,144
That's what they're trying to do,
those "degenerate" artists.

101
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:13,238
Elisabeth, you're late again.
You look a mess!

102
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:15,407
Chest out! Chin up!

103
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,086
You, in the first row. Come.

104
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:32,341
You'll give him the bouquet.

105
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:53,904
Heil! Heil! Heil!

106
00:12:32,086 --> 00:12:33,128
Don't look away.

107
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:36,840
Never look away, Kurt.

108
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:41,678
Everything that's true is beautiful.

109
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,122
This note.

110
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:12,251
It contains the whole power of music...

111
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:15,378
of life itself,

112
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:17,047
of the entire universe.

113
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:22,428
People look for the code of the world.

114
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:24,221
But here it is!

115
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:28,559
Here.

116
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:31,937
Do you hear that?

117
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,777
The A above middle C
on the May's family piano in Großschönau.

118
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,823
And now that I've found it...

119
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:47,286
I can play it anywhere.

120
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:56,253
On the table.

121
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:00,507
Can you hear it?

122
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,719
Even on my head.

123
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:09,558
- Aunt Elisabeth, you're bleeding.
- Even on my head.

124
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:13,770
Elisabeth!

125
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:16,690
For God's sake, what are you doing?

126
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,276
Playing a concert for the Führer!

127
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:27,033
"Youthful delusion."
That almost sounds harmless.

128
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:31,079
"Mild schizophrenia, youthful delusion."
I can hear you!

129
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:35,751
But nothing that can't be healed
by some time away.

130
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:38,461
Time away in...

131
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:40,004
In an institution, yes.

132
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:42,715
Couldn't we try
giving her some rest at home first?

133
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:48,054
She worked so hard to graduate and went
straight into the secretarial course...

134
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:49,389
Elisabeth?

135
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,769
Perhaps it's simply overexertion.

136
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:00,150
Is this your wife?

137
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:06,572
You can't stand her, right?
I can tell by your posture.

138
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:07,783
Elisabeth!

139
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:11,619
Kindly wait outside
until we've finished talking.

140
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,205
I won't tell you again.

141
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:28,845
As schizophrenia is a hereditary
condition, I'm obliged to ask.

142
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:32,349
Are there other cases of mental illness
in your family?

143
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:34,518
For God's sake, no!

144
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:39,022
- Depression?
- We're all cheerful people.

145
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:43,110
We doctors are the guardians
of the flow of hereditary health.

146
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:45,778
I must report this
to the Health Authority.

147
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,865
The decision on the committal
may not be up to you.

148
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:53,954
Dr. Michaelis...

149
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:57,082
Franz.

150
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:00,586
I knew your parents.
Even your grandparents.

151
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:02,337
Please...

152
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:04,131
Don't report it.

153
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:10,095
As it's you, Mrs. May.

154
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:14,141
But tell me right away
if her condition worsens.

155
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:17,977
- Good-bye.
- Heil Hitler!

156
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:21,148
- Of course. Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

157
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:45,380
<i>Operator.</i>

158
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:48,050
Connect me with the Health Authority.

159
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:52,386
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye, Günther.

160
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:54,348
Ms. May, we have to leave now.

161
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:57,975
- Take care, sister.
- We'll miss you.

162
00:16:57,976 --> 00:16:59,728
It is only for a couple of weeks.

163
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:01,605
We'll see each other soon.

164
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:05,025
Good-bye, Ehrenfried.

165
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:08,820
Good-bye. We'll miss you.

166
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:12,407
I don't want to, Mama.

167
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,493
Kurt, go back inside.

168
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:16,078
Kurt!

169
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,829
I don't want to go!

170
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,040
Grab her legs.

171
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:25,169
- Got her?
- Yes.

172
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,505
No!

173
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:31,593
- Come.
- Hold her still.

174
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,765
She'll be quiet in a moment.

175
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,692
Scopolamine. It works quickly.

176
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:52,864
Let's strap her in.

177
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:03,874
Her suitcase!

178
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,210
Of course.

179
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,757
- These are her things.
- Okay.

180
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:27,232
Never look away!

181
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:54,885
My dear colleagues,

182
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:57,471
I'd like to congratulate you.

183
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:01,432
Since we introduced the law,

184
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:05,269
the weakest percentile of the German
population has been rendered infertile.

185
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,897
400,000 individuals.

186
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:09,191
A proud figure.

187
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,901
A contribution towards positive breeding

188
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:14,780
that future generations
will thank you for.

189
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,450
It is now my hope
that we shall one day live

190
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:23,496
in a world where the streets
are completely free

191
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:28,126
of mongoloids, the mentally ill,
and other deformed individuals.

192
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:32,964
But it is time to shift into higher gear.

193
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:36,133
As a result of British air raids,

194
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:38,970
we have an increased need
for auxiliary hospital places.

195
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:43,766
We cannot permit a situation
whereby a wounded German soldier

196
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:45,476
is denied a place in a hospital

197
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:49,272
because it is being used
to take care of a useless life.

198
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:57,322
How can we help you? What can we do?

199
00:19:58,281 --> 00:20:01,201
Thank you for asking that question, Carl.

200
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:05,079
Gentlemen,

201
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,917
from now on
you are not just doctors and SS officers.

202
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:12,420
You are experts
at the Court of Hereditary Health.

203
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:14,130
What does this mean?

204
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:20,636
Well, any patient you have sterilized
and whose medical file you mark

205
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:23,265
with a blue minus sign...

206
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,475
remains in the institution.

207
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:28,727
However,
if we find a red plus sign on the file,

208
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:32,314
we know that the life in question
is a worthless one,

209
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:36,443
and the patient will be transferred
to one of three special institutions

210
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:39,698
in the eastern part of the Reich and there

211
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:42,158
will be relieved
of a meaningless existence.

212
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:45,537
Your pen.

213
00:20:46,872 --> 00:20:47,998
Your sword.

214
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:12,563
Examination and preliminary interview.
Elisabeth May, 23 years old.

215
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:15,566
Sterilization appointment today, 3:45 p.m.

216
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:16,568
Thank you.

217
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:22,908
You may enter.
The form of address is "Herr Professor."

218
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:51,394
You may sit down there.

219
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:14,000
Did your daughter paint that?

220
00:22:18,964 --> 00:22:20,674
Why do you think you are here?

221
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:26,054
Because sometimes I don't think right.

222
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,516
Do you know what kind of hospital
I am running here?

223
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,018
A gynecological hospital.

224
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:37,232
A very nice girl, your daughter.

225
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:41,111
I can see from the picture.

226
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:44,572
Not what you'd call artistically talented.

227
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:48,962
I suppose
you might even be pleased by that?

228
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:51,121
But a lot of heart.

229
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:55,250
I have a nephew the same age.

230
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:57,544
Unfortunately, he's very talented.

231
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:00,839
I sometimes take him to exhibitions,
to encourage him.

232
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:04,592
Good.

233
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:08,555
Now please get on the examination chair
in the next room.

234
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:10,890
You may keep...

235
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:13,767
I insist on speaking to Professor Seeband!

236
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:14,978
Excuse me for a moment.

237
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:21,150
I've tried to get an appointment
for weeks and received no response.

238
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:22,818
I'm entitled to speak with him!

239
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:24,945
Excuse me, Professor. I couldn't stop him.

240
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:26,197
Mr. Lohse-Wächtler.

241
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,659
You asked me
if I wanted my daughter's suffering

242
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:33,038
to be passed on to the next generation.

243
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,164
That is why I agreed to the operation.

244
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:38,167
But what about her suffering now?

245
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:40,544
You're a German man. Compose yourself!

246
00:23:40,545 --> 00:23:41,962
And my suffering?

247
00:23:41,963 --> 00:23:44,257
I will not tolerate this tone any longer!

248
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:47,010
I'll report you, Professor Seeband.

249
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:49,054
To the Reich Medical Board.

250
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,724
You do that, Mr. Lohse-Wächtler.
You do that.

251
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:56,102
You're a doctor.
You've sworn the Hippocratic Oath.

252
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:57,437
Let go of me!

253
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,147
One day, this will all catch up with you!

254
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:03,734
STERILIZATION APPOINTMENT 3:45 P.M.

255
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:05,695
It will catch up with you!

256
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:09,114
It will catch up with you for sure!

257
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:11,784
It'll catch up with you,
Professor Seeband!

258
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:13,369
One day!

259
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:27,966
You should not have looked at that.

260
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:30,719
My ancestry is sound. I know I'm healthy.

261
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,429
Three experts disagree.

262
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,015
- No!
- Sit down!

263
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:46,196
You will first go to the examination room
and then to the operating room.

264
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,947
And you will cooperate.

265
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:52,866
Otherwise we will have to strap you down,
and it will be more difficult

266
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:54,202
and more painful.

267
00:25:07,132 --> 00:25:10,009
Please. Mr. Seeband.

268
00:25:10,385 --> 00:25:13,096
Herr Professor, please.

269
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:18,725
For the fuhrer... I'll bear many children.
Healthy, Aryan children.

270
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:21,396
I'll give them to the Führer,
just as we are supposed to.

271
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:26,192
And my children will give
their children to the Führer too.

272
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:28,152
For the war!

273
00:25:28,153 --> 00:25:30,155
You need soldiers, don't you?

274
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:32,115
You must need more soldiers!

275
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,534
Who else will go to battle?

276
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:38,413
I'm only confused sometimes.

277
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:40,206
It's very seldom.

278
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:45,003
I don't want to go!

279
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:50,090
I need backup!

280
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:51,801
You're a father too.

281
00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:55,929
Please, for your daughter. She paints too.

282
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,975
- That's enough!
- I could be her sister.

283
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,019
You could be my father.

284
00:26:01,895 --> 00:26:03,313
Please, Papa.

285
00:26:04,564 --> 00:26:05,607
Please, Papa!

286
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:07,649
No!

287
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:08,651
Papa!

288
00:26:09,944 --> 00:26:11,069
Papa!

289
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,697
Please, Papa!

290
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:15,283
Papa, please!

291
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,328
Please, Papa!

292
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,803
<i>- Anna.
- Yes, Herr Professor?</i>

293
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:38,973
I will not perform the operation
on Miss May.

294
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:40,474
Assign Blockmann.

295
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:42,393
<i>But he's scheduled for the delivery room.</i>

296
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,520
Then change the schedule!

297
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:42,662
Thank you.

298
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:54,215
You both look so handsome in your
uniforms. Elisabeth will be pleased.

299
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,803
Johann.

300
00:27:59,971 --> 00:28:01,180
Yes.

301
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:05,392
You know...

302
00:28:05,393 --> 00:28:07,812
I know.
After the war, it will be my capital.

303
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:10,732
And don't forget the salute,
"Heil Hitler."

304
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:20,073
If you can't bring yourself to say it,
just say <i>"drei liter"</i> quickly.

305
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:21,326
Nobody will notice.

306
00:28:23,828 --> 00:28:25,996
And not a word
about your incessant painting.

307
00:28:25,997 --> 00:28:27,707
Especially the nudes!

308
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:42,180
Heil Hitler!

309
00:28:42,597 --> 00:28:47,226
Drei <i>liter.</i> We have an appointment
to visit... Elisabeth May.

310
00:28:47,602 --> 00:28:49,896
I'm Johann Barnert, her brother-in-law.

311
00:28:50,438 --> 00:28:53,357
Her brothers, Ehrenfried and Günther May.

312
00:28:53,358 --> 00:28:55,067
Her sister, Waltraud.

313
00:28:55,068 --> 00:28:56,986
And her mother, Malvine.

314
00:28:58,488 --> 00:29:00,615
Please turn a little to the right.

315
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:04,952
Miss Elisabeth May
was transferred the day before yesterday.

316
00:29:05,286 --> 00:29:07,412
Transferred? That's impossible.

317
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:08,873
All look here, please.

318
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,958
Orders from the Central Office.

319
00:29:13,336 --> 00:29:14,337
But where to?

320
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:16,547
Aren't two missing?

321
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:19,092
Käthe, we're waiting for you.

322
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:21,552
Where has she been transferred?

323
00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:24,972
Großschweidnitz Hospital.

324
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:27,058
Großschweidnitz?

325
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:31,144
That's two days from here!
How are we supposed to visit her?

326
00:29:31,145 --> 00:29:34,482
We work,
and the boys are on leave from the front.

327
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:36,609
I can't tell you any more than that.

328
00:29:37,151 --> 00:29:39,195
I have to go now. Heil Hitler!

329
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:41,989
That's it.

330
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:54,210
I'll write to the Health Ministry.

331
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:56,212
Please look in this direction.

332
00:30:03,344 --> 00:30:05,346
FEBRUARY 13, 1945

333
00:30:53,186 --> 00:30:55,896
Tinfoil. I read about that.

334
00:30:55,897 --> 00:30:57,940
It's to interfere
with the radio and radar.

335
00:31:24,342 --> 00:31:27,220
Johanna! Johanna! Wake up!

336
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:33,017
Mama! Mama!

337
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:49,115
This way! There's a slope up there.

338
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:50,576
Head down!

339
00:31:53,204 --> 00:31:54,330
<i>Günther!</i>

340
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:58,167
Günther!

341
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:33,285
I like you.

342
00:32:33,286 --> 00:32:35,037
I like you too.

343
00:33:57,703 --> 00:34:01,248
MAY 8, 1945

344
00:34:37,076 --> 00:34:38,202
Mr. Seeband?

345
00:34:38,953 --> 00:34:41,163
Professor Seeband. Yes, that's me.

346
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:15,865
Mr. Seeband.

347
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:17,324
Professor Seeband.

348
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:21,537
What did he say?

349
00:35:22,663 --> 00:35:25,791
He wants to be addressed
as "Herr Professor."

350
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:37,094
All right.

351
00:35:38,429 --> 00:35:40,097
Herr Professor.

352
00:35:47,772 --> 00:35:49,482
Where is Burghart Kroll?

353
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:51,316
Who?

354
00:35:51,317 --> 00:35:52,485
Burghart Kroll.

355
00:35:56,822 --> 00:36:00,116
The head of the Reich Medical Work Group.

356
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:02,453
We know about your meetings in Berlin.

357
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:07,249
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I do not know this man.

358
00:36:20,471 --> 00:36:21,764
I still don't know him.

359
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:47,414
If my child were born with health
problems, should it be put to death?

360
00:36:52,253 --> 00:36:56,298
It so happens that space
and resources on this earth are limited.

361
00:36:57,091 --> 00:37:00,094
Who should have them?
The healthy or the sick?

362
00:37:17,403 --> 00:37:20,531
Soon there will be
one more place available on this earth.

363
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:33,752
You have not indicated
if you were a member of the Nazi Party.

364
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:36,255
Were you a member of the Party?

365
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,423
Principal, for many years...

366
00:37:38,424 --> 00:37:41,343
Yes or no, Mr. Barnert?

367
00:37:43,596 --> 00:37:44,722
Yes.

368
00:37:57,443 --> 00:37:58,861
But I'm not a Nazi.

369
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:01,780
Three quarters of all teachers
were in the Party.

370
00:38:02,698 --> 00:38:07,077
And it is to the remaining quarter that we
shall entrust our children. Good day.

371
00:38:21,008 --> 00:38:22,551
Too hot!

372
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,646
"The Patriotic War."

373
00:38:39,068 --> 00:38:41,946
"The Patriotic War...

374
00:38:44,365 --> 00:38:47,368
is... is special."

375
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:14,853
Comrade!

376
00:39:17,815 --> 00:39:18,857
Comrade!

377
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,113
What?

378
00:39:25,114 --> 00:39:27,782
The preliminary contractions are too long.

379
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:29,863
The baby is in the wrong position.
It can't come out!

380
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:31,787
What?

381
00:39:32,538 --> 00:39:35,082
Call the interpreter. Immediately.

382
00:39:54,852 --> 00:39:58,188
He is suspicious.
He asks why you want to help.

383
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,316
I want to help because I can.

384
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,322
You may go.

385
00:40:31,597 --> 00:40:35,392
A gypsy woman predicted
I'd never have children.

386
00:40:36,143 --> 00:40:37,770
It's my fate.

387
00:40:38,854 --> 00:40:42,608
- Place her sideways.
- Turn her sideways across the bed.

388
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:47,863
Which week is she in?

389
00:40:49,907 --> 00:40:50,990
The 36th.

390
00:40:50,991 --> 00:40:52,117
Blood pressure?

391
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,328
110 over 70.

392
00:40:55,329 --> 00:40:59,666
What a fool I am to believe
I could trick fate and have children!

393
00:41:01,752 --> 00:41:04,379
Tell her
she will definitely have one child.

394
00:41:04,797 --> 00:41:06,632
And if she wants, many more after that.

395
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:16,266
The child is in the transverse position.

396
00:41:18,811 --> 00:41:21,480
During contractions,
the uterus is too hard to turn the child.

397
00:41:22,731 --> 00:41:25,191
I'll open the amniotic sac from inside.

398
00:41:25,192 --> 00:41:27,611
In a pause between contractions,
I'll turn the baby.

399
00:41:32,533 --> 00:41:34,118
I'm a military interpreter.

400
00:41:37,913 --> 00:41:38,997
Do it.

401
00:41:44,753 --> 00:41:46,046
Gloves, please.

402
00:41:54,054 --> 00:41:55,097
Vodka, please.

403
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:03,105
Don't dry them. Don't touch.

404
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:10,863
We'll do it without anesthesia.

405
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:23,792
I already have a leg.

406
00:42:28,922 --> 00:42:31,383
We must wait for the next contraction.

407
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:36,555
Now I'm placing the index finger
in the baby's mouth.

408
00:42:44,563 --> 00:42:46,773
Pressing the chin against the chest.

409
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:50,485
And slowly pulling out the baby's head.

410
00:42:57,868 --> 00:43:00,495
A boy. A healthy boy.

411
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:20,224
Alexander Mikhailovich!

412
00:43:24,394 --> 00:43:26,772
And a beautiful, healthy mother.

413
00:43:30,692 --> 00:43:32,527
Congratulations, Major.

414
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:48,585
Whoever saves a life
saves the entire world.

415
00:43:50,921 --> 00:43:52,339
You have saved my world,

416
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:54,341
Herr Professor.

417
00:43:56,468 --> 00:43:58,845
No one will harm a hair on your head.

418
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,640
You are now under my personal protection.

419
00:44:04,518 --> 00:44:06,603
Prepare a guest room for the professor.

420
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,314
And bring him some decent clothes.

421
00:44:21,076 --> 00:44:24,413
Look at him. This is our son.

422
00:46:06,306 --> 00:46:09,810
Father.
You don't have to worry any longer!

423
00:46:10,435 --> 00:46:13,605
Now I understand! I understand.

424
00:46:15,232 --> 00:46:16,565
What is it you understand?

425
00:46:16,566 --> 00:46:18,234
Everything.

426
00:46:18,235 --> 00:46:21,738
How everything is connected.
That everything is connected.

427
00:46:23,573 --> 00:46:24,950
The code of the world.

428
00:46:27,202 --> 00:46:28,245
<i>' 'L</i>

429
00:46:29,079 --> 00:46:32,958
I never have to worry again.
I never have to be afraid again.

430
00:46:33,542 --> 00:46:34,793
I'm untouchable.

431
00:46:37,421 --> 00:46:38,672
That's nice.

432
00:46:39,089 --> 00:46:40,756
No, Father, you don't understand.

433
00:46:40,757 --> 00:46:44,052
You don't have to worry either.
Really. And...

434
00:46:44,594 --> 00:46:47,930
I don't even have to be an artist.
I can choose any profession.

435
00:46:47,931 --> 00:46:51,810
And I will find what's right, what's true!

436
00:46:54,813 --> 00:46:56,690
I'm happy for you, really.

437
00:46:58,066 --> 00:46:59,626
I need to preserve this moment somehow!

438
00:47:00,277 --> 00:47:02,112
Somehow I need to preserve this moment.

439
00:47:07,993 --> 00:47:09,369
Now I understand.

440
00:47:19,421 --> 00:47:21,256
I know who it is you're thinking about.

441
00:47:22,007 --> 00:47:23,341
But he's different.

442
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:48,283
STENCILING AND SIGNAGE STUDIOS
DRESDEN

443
00:47:57,918 --> 00:47:59,210
Good morning, Father.

444
00:47:59,211 --> 00:48:00,670
Good morning, my boy.

445
00:48:27,447 --> 00:48:29,074
Check the alignment, colleague.

446
00:48:56,351 --> 00:48:58,478
Do you do that
so you can feel better than us?

447
00:48:58,895 --> 00:48:59,979
Do what?

448
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:01,106
That.

449
00:49:01,523 --> 00:49:04,943
Drawing freehand while the rest of us
sweat away with stencils.

450
00:49:06,778 --> 00:49:08,405
Are you trying to make us look bad?

451
00:49:09,489 --> 00:49:10,657
Why do you do it?

452
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:13,451
I do it because I can.

453
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:28,842
See you tomorrow, then.

454
00:49:51,948 --> 00:49:55,327
You can take the pencils with you
if you bring them back.

455
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:04,252
In January, they're accepting
applications to the Academy of Art.

456
00:50:05,462 --> 00:50:07,172
I'm content with this work.

457
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:24,648
What's the point of this?

458
00:50:25,649 --> 00:50:27,609
Does stuff like this help the workingman?

459
00:50:28,818 --> 00:50:31,321
Does it give your father strength
to clean the stairs?

460
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:33,448
You want to help him, don't you?

461
00:50:34,449 --> 00:50:36,451
You even arranged for him to get the job.

462
00:50:41,081 --> 00:50:42,832
Been through a lot of shit, have you?

463
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:47,545
But does it help to wallow in it?

464
00:50:47,879 --> 00:50:51,299
Will it help create a world
where your kids have it better than you?

465
00:50:51,675 --> 00:50:53,343
That's what communism is all about.

466
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:02,686
I'll support your application.

467
00:51:03,812 --> 00:51:06,606
The girls at the academy
are prettier than the ones here.

468
00:51:38,054 --> 00:51:41,891
Can you see here
that someone left all vanity aside

469
00:51:42,267 --> 00:51:44,310
and put himself
in the service of the cause?

470
00:51:44,853 --> 00:51:46,688
In the service of the people?

471
00:51:48,648 --> 00:51:50,483
Work on your attitude.

472
00:51:50,692 --> 00:51:52,610
Work on your craft.

473
00:51:52,902 --> 00:51:56,489
And the right art
will flow out of you on its own accord.

474
00:51:57,198 --> 00:52:00,952
I would suggest Pablo Picasso
as a cautionary example.

475
00:52:02,078 --> 00:52:04,705
He created powerful realistic pictures

476
00:52:04,706 --> 00:52:08,293
that demonstrate genuine solidarity
with the working classes.

477
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:17,469
But he soon slipped
into a decadent, obscene formalism.

478
00:52:19,012 --> 00:52:20,263
Why?

479
00:52:21,222 --> 00:52:25,602
Because he wanted to be seen
as an innovator, not a traditionalist.

480
00:52:26,686 --> 00:52:30,565
Innovation. Creative independence.
Artistic freedom.

481
00:52:31,441 --> 00:52:34,319
Words that initially sound tempting
to an artist.

482
00:52:34,986 --> 00:52:36,988
Me, me, me.

483
00:52:37,572 --> 00:52:41,366
But a modern artist
can only achieve real freedom

484
00:52:41,367 --> 00:52:44,204
if he serves the interests of the people.

485
00:52:44,913 --> 00:52:47,874
The "me, me, me" stance leads to misery.

486
00:52:48,416 --> 00:52:52,837
At best, it will lead to being subsidized
by decadent, wealthy collectors,

487
00:52:53,713 --> 00:52:56,673
exploiters of the workingman
who delight in the fact

488
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:58,842
that they have nothing in common
with the people,

489
00:52:58,843 --> 00:53:00,845
not even the same taste in art.

490
00:53:03,515 --> 00:53:07,018
Decay, mysticism, and pornography.

491
00:53:08,019 --> 00:53:10,355
Empty forms, artificial constructions.

492
00:53:10,772 --> 00:53:13,357
Splotches, lines, spheres, cones...

493
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:16,820
All that, just in order
to be considered an innovator?

494
00:53:18,279 --> 00:53:19,781
Yes, it's new.

495
00:53:20,448 --> 00:53:22,033
But it's also wrong.

496
00:53:23,743 --> 00:53:28,581
And vain and stupid,
undemocratic, decadent.

497
00:53:30,208 --> 00:53:33,545
Be different, gentlemen. Be different.

498
00:53:58,403 --> 00:54:00,905
You had the hammer
a little higher up before.

499
00:54:02,532 --> 00:54:04,367
Right, it was quite a bit higher up.

500
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:06,536
Still higher.

501
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:10,622
- Like this?
- The left hand was more in the middle.

502
00:54:10,623 --> 00:54:12,917
And your right hand
was much further to the front.

503
00:54:13,543 --> 00:54:15,502
- More.
- Further, further.

504
00:54:15,503 --> 00:54:16,879
Still further.

505
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,423
- Like this?
- Further, further...

506
00:54:19,424 --> 00:54:20,967
Move the top to the front.

507
00:54:21,509 --> 00:54:24,052
Exactly. Right about there, huh?

508
00:54:24,053 --> 00:54:26,347
- That's about right.
- Looks good.

509
00:54:26,806 --> 00:54:28,391
No, it can't have been like that.

510
00:54:29,434 --> 00:54:30,894
Cut the nonsense.

511
00:54:31,394 --> 00:54:32,770
The hammer was higher up.

512
00:54:35,273 --> 00:54:37,233
No. Lower down.

513
00:54:38,943 --> 00:54:40,361
No, further up.

514
00:54:41,237 --> 00:54:42,405
Further up.

515
00:54:42,655 --> 00:54:46,326
Down, up, down, up.

516
00:54:51,581 --> 00:54:53,124
Comrade Professor!

517
00:54:55,126 --> 00:54:58,670
Comrade Professor,
these young people are out of control.

518
00:54:58,671 --> 00:55:03,176
They don't take me seriously. I have
big responsibilities here, you know!

519
00:55:06,137 --> 00:55:08,222
Are we in kindergarten here?

520
00:55:22,195 --> 00:55:23,863
Yes, it looks like we are.

521
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:55,812
A girl in the Fashion Department
is giving away Western pencils!

522
00:56:04,654 --> 00:56:05,738
Excuse me!

523
00:56:08,116 --> 00:56:09,283
Excuse me!

524
00:56:10,785 --> 00:56:11,869
Excuse me!

525
00:56:14,956 --> 00:56:16,581
- Thanks.
- My pleasure.

526
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:19,794
- Amazing. 2B. Thanks.
- Hello, Ernst.

527
00:56:21,504 --> 00:56:24,132
- Thanks for sharing.
- Of course. You're welcome.

528
00:56:26,217 --> 00:56:28,428
- Say hi to Lise for me.
- I will. Thanks.

529
00:56:29,429 --> 00:56:30,430
Michael.

530
00:56:31,472 --> 00:56:32,682
Thanks, Elisabeth.

531
00:56:36,269 --> 00:56:39,147
Don't get your hopes up. She's mine.

532
00:56:39,814 --> 00:56:41,607
Watch and learn.

533
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,656
<i>2B or 4B?</i>

534
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:53,953
Well?

535
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:56,789
2B, but...

536
00:56:57,665 --> 00:57:00,793
I'd like a date even more than a pencil.

537
00:57:04,756 --> 00:57:06,674
Let's just leave it at a pencil for now.

538
00:57:07,508 --> 00:57:08,509
Are you sure?

539
00:57:09,343 --> 00:57:10,470
Sure.

540
00:57:26,069 --> 00:57:27,111
Your name's Elisabeth?

541
00:57:31,157 --> 00:57:32,408
Do you want one too?

542
00:57:32,825 --> 00:57:34,409
There's only...

543
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:35,703
4B left.

544
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:43,878
Thanks.

545
00:57:54,514 --> 00:57:57,391
A golden pheasant like you
shouldn't use a tin for an ashtray.

546
00:57:58,893 --> 00:58:00,144
Golden pheasant?

547
00:58:00,478 --> 00:58:01,479
Yes.

548
00:58:02,105 --> 00:58:04,023
I can't let you get away with that.

549
00:58:04,774 --> 00:58:06,192
I completely agree.

550
00:58:08,861 --> 00:58:10,154
How about a walk?

551
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:12,240
In the park?

552
00:58:13,366 --> 00:58:15,660
So I can rectify my misapprehension?

553
00:58:39,267 --> 00:58:41,435
I thought you wanted to talk with me?

554
00:58:42,937 --> 00:58:45,148
Actually,
I wanted to take a walk with you.

555
00:58:46,691 --> 00:58:48,066
Very well.

556
00:58:48,067 --> 00:58:50,778
Then I'll make conversation.

557
00:58:53,906 --> 00:58:55,741
Socialist Realism,

558
00:58:56,409 --> 00:58:57,869
is that your thing?

559
00:58:59,287 --> 00:59:04,000
Probably about as much
as Lotte Ulbricht's fashion is your thing.

560
00:59:11,924 --> 00:59:13,843
Why do you keep looking at me like that?

561
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:17,889
You remind me of somebody.

562
00:59:20,725 --> 00:59:22,310
Would you like to paint me?

563
00:59:23,102 --> 00:59:24,520
I don't know.

564
00:59:25,229 --> 00:59:27,315
Would you like to make a suit for me?

565
00:59:32,236 --> 00:59:33,654
I should be getting home.

566
00:59:34,488 --> 00:59:36,073
Can I accompany you?

567
00:59:37,575 --> 00:59:39,076
Just to the door.

568
00:59:45,875 --> 00:59:49,795
SOCIALISM NEEDS EVERYONE
SOCIALISM IS FOR EVERYONE

569
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,053
DANCE SCHOOL

570
01:00:02,975 --> 01:00:04,393
You're taking dance lessons?

571
01:00:05,394 --> 01:00:06,395
I live here.

572
01:00:06,979 --> 01:00:08,314
The house belongs to us.

573
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,318
You're not really dispelling
the whole golden pheasant thing.

574
01:00:13,778 --> 01:00:17,072
We were just lucky.
The house wasn't even hit once.

575
01:00:17,073 --> 01:00:19,325
The whole street looked like this
before the war.

576
01:00:23,913 --> 01:00:25,331
Good-bye, Kurt.

577
01:00:26,666 --> 01:00:27,875
Good-bye...

578
01:00:30,336 --> 01:00:31,587
Elisabeth?

579
01:00:35,758 --> 01:00:37,343
Could I call you something else?

580
01:00:38,302 --> 01:00:39,971
Maybe you have a nickname?

581
01:00:41,597 --> 01:00:43,598
Everyone calls me Elisabeth, really.

582
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:46,060
"Really" mostly means
the very opposite is true.

583
01:00:48,479 --> 01:00:49,522
All right.

584
01:00:50,398 --> 01:00:52,316
My father calls me "Ellie."

585
01:00:54,193 --> 01:00:55,611
Good-bye, Ellie.

586
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:13,546
Elisabeth.

587
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:25,826
More volume.

588
01:02:46,097 --> 01:02:49,100
You could have taken
a bit more time off, Kurt.

589
01:02:52,728 --> 01:02:53,813
Good.

590
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,348
That's enough for today.

591
01:03:30,933 --> 01:03:32,059
Oh, yes, good.

592
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:33,436
Good night.

593
01:03:35,771 --> 01:03:36,856
See you tomorrow.

594
01:04:30,034 --> 01:04:31,869
A golden pheasant as the workingwoman?

595
01:04:40,669 --> 01:04:42,546
You're my semester thesis now.

596
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:45,799
A suit.

597
01:04:46,884 --> 01:04:48,135
For you.

598
01:05:51,532 --> 01:05:52,908
I'll never take it off again.

599
01:06:21,103 --> 01:06:23,647
You're so beautiful,
it's almost unromantic.

600
01:06:26,066 --> 01:06:27,901
It's far too easy to love you.

601
01:06:33,991 --> 01:06:35,159
Do you love me?

602
01:06:38,245 --> 01:06:39,705
Do you love me?

603
01:06:41,832 --> 01:06:43,250
Otherwise it doesn't work for me.

604
01:06:46,337 --> 01:06:48,047
Without love, it won't work.

605
01:06:51,008 --> 01:06:52,509
I love you.

606
01:06:54,386 --> 01:06:55,679
Really?

607
01:06:57,389 --> 01:06:58,515
Yes.

608
01:07:31,048 --> 01:07:32,424
I love you!

609
01:07:35,511 --> 01:07:38,138
I love you.

610
01:08:02,538 --> 01:08:03,706
My parents!

611
01:08:05,082 --> 01:08:06,417
I thought they lived in Chemnitz.

612
01:08:07,835 --> 01:08:08,919
They do.

613
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:26,186
My father!

614
01:08:27,104 --> 01:08:28,522
What will we do now?

615
01:11:00,257 --> 01:11:01,425
Elisabeth?

616
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:03,260
Sound asleep.

617
01:11:03,719 --> 01:11:08,181
She left a candle burning.
When is she finally going to grow up?

618
01:11:10,559 --> 01:11:12,019
Yes, youth...

619
01:11:14,479 --> 01:11:16,315
So, how did you get the scratches?

620
01:11:17,941 --> 01:11:20,360
Like I said, it's from garden work.

621
01:11:21,695 --> 01:11:23,779
Yeah, I know
about that kind of garden work.

622
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:26,033
Looks like you really have a green thumb.

623
01:11:27,576 --> 01:11:30,495
Ah, here comes the "garden work."

624
01:11:31,038 --> 01:11:32,164
Let's go, boys.

625
01:11:35,334 --> 01:11:37,752
So how are things
in your garden these days?

626
01:11:37,753 --> 01:11:39,463
Mine suffers from drought.

627
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:47,554
Thanks for risking your life
for my reputation.

628
01:11:48,847 --> 01:11:50,933
But don't ever do anything so crazy again.

629
01:11:54,519 --> 01:11:55,645
Did your parents...

630
01:11:55,646 --> 01:11:58,231
They didn't notice a thing.
Nothing at all.

631
01:12:02,027 --> 01:12:03,487
They're moving back to Dresden.

632
01:12:04,738 --> 01:12:07,658
My father will get his old job back
as hospital director.

633
01:12:08,325 --> 01:12:10,576
But he has to rent out
a room in our house,

634
01:12:10,577 --> 01:12:14,581
or he'll get into trouble
with the Residence Allocation Office.

635
01:12:15,791 --> 01:12:17,584
He's going to put up a sign on Monday.

636
01:12:19,378 --> 01:12:21,046
You wouldn't perhaps like to...

637
01:12:22,214 --> 01:12:24,174
be the first to discover that sign?

638
01:12:24,591 --> 01:12:25,884
Quite by chance?

639
01:12:29,846 --> 01:12:33,642
They couldn't really hold it against me
if I fell in love with a tenant

640
01:12:34,101 --> 01:12:35,644
they chose themselves.

641
01:12:42,484 --> 01:12:46,154
But your mother,
won't she sense something?

642
01:12:47,531 --> 01:12:50,534
Oh, Mama. She's such an innocent.

643
01:12:51,410 --> 01:12:54,579
Don't worry about her.
She won't suspect a thing.

644
01:12:55,747 --> 01:12:57,374
Really, nothing at all.

645
01:13:23,942 --> 01:13:25,027
Yes?

646
01:13:25,402 --> 01:13:28,530
I've come about the sign.
ls the room still for rent?

647
01:13:29,656 --> 01:13:31,742
We put the sign up
a quarter of an hour ago.

648
01:13:32,576 --> 01:13:33,827
Is that a yes?

649
01:13:41,126 --> 01:13:42,209
Come in.

650
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:43,711
Short, short, long.

651
01:13:43,712 --> 01:13:45,504
- Mrs. Seeband?
- Yes?

652
01:13:45,505 --> 01:13:47,548
Someone's here about the room.

653
01:13:47,549 --> 01:13:48,800
That was quick.

654
01:13:49,384 --> 01:13:52,262
Short, short and... arms up!

655
01:13:53,597 --> 01:13:57,934
Short, short, long. Short, short, long.

656
01:13:59,352 --> 01:14:02,355
Head up! Short, short, long.

657
01:14:03,148 --> 01:14:07,611
Short, short, long. Short, short, long.

658
01:14:12,866 --> 01:14:15,494
Short, short... arms up!

659
01:14:19,831 --> 01:14:21,249
Barnert, Kurt.

660
01:14:24,628 --> 01:14:26,296
What do you do for a living?

661
01:14:26,963 --> 01:14:28,423
I'm a student.

662
01:14:29,091 --> 01:14:30,382
Fashion?

663
01:14:30,383 --> 01:14:32,468
- Painting.
- Painting?

664
01:14:32,469 --> 01:14:34,345
Mrs. Hellthaler, please come up.

665
01:14:34,346 --> 01:14:37,557
Carl, there's a tenant for the room.
Do come down.

666
01:15:01,915 --> 01:15:04,459
You have facial paresis.

667
01:15:05,752 --> 01:15:07,379
Partial facial paralysis.

668
01:15:08,130 --> 01:15:09,965
The corner of your mouth hangs.

669
01:15:10,882 --> 01:15:14,093
Did you have an accident or Lyme disease?

670
01:15:14,094 --> 01:15:15,761
Kindly take this up to the office.

671
01:15:15,762 --> 01:15:18,181
Then my husband can talk with the tenant.

672
01:15:18,974 --> 01:15:22,561
My husband's a doctor. It's his passion.
Occasionally one gets a free diagnosis.

673
01:15:23,353 --> 01:15:24,813
You should have that examined.

674
01:15:25,897 --> 01:15:27,941
Kurt comes with the best recommendations.

675
01:15:29,234 --> 01:15:31,528
He's a student, a non-smoker...

676
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:36,241
We've already agreed on the rent.

677
01:15:36,533 --> 01:15:39,786
But of course, it's your decision
whether he gets the room.

678
01:15:40,662 --> 01:15:42,288
Kurt wants to be a painter.

679
01:15:42,289 --> 01:15:43,415
I am a painter.

680
01:15:44,499 --> 01:15:46,876
The house's facade is starting to peel.

681
01:15:46,877 --> 01:15:48,920
Maybe we could take
the painting off the rent.

682
01:15:49,629 --> 01:15:52,048
I'm not that kind of painter.

683
01:15:53,341 --> 01:15:54,676
What kind are you?

684
01:15:56,261 --> 01:15:57,470
A painter of pictures.

685
01:15:57,762 --> 01:15:59,431
Socialist Realism?

686
01:16:01,183 --> 01:16:02,559
Is there any other kind?

687
01:16:03,768 --> 01:16:05,187
I hope not.

688
01:16:07,105 --> 01:16:08,857
You can have the room anyway.

689
01:16:10,108 --> 01:16:11,359
Thank you, Mr. Seeband.

690
01:16:11,693 --> 01:16:13,361
Professor Seeband, please.

691
01:16:19,159 --> 01:16:20,619
Nice suit.

692
01:17:50,333 --> 01:17:52,002
What are you doing up so late?

693
01:17:53,503 --> 01:17:54,838
I've... been out.

694
01:17:55,297 --> 01:17:56,339
Alcohol?

695
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:59,092
That can't be good for your work.

696
01:17:59,968 --> 01:18:01,553
Now get to bed.

697
01:18:33,918 --> 01:18:35,628
I don't like that Kurt.

698
01:18:38,465 --> 01:18:41,343
We have to make sure
Ellie doesn't get too friendly with him.

699
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:46,306
Why?

700
01:18:47,766 --> 01:18:50,060
So she can make a good catch, of course.

701
01:18:52,562 --> 01:18:54,564
Just as you made a good catch.

702
01:19:15,043 --> 01:19:19,254
Professor Seeband, about yesterday...
l... Of course, I'd never tell.

703
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:21,216
You have a new subject.

704
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:24,594
Me.

705
01:19:25,553 --> 01:19:27,347
For the directors' gallery.

706
01:19:28,681 --> 01:19:30,475
In that style, more or less.

707
01:19:31,976 --> 01:19:35,271
We start tomorrow at 4:00 p.m.
In my office at the hospital, all right?

708
01:19:41,194 --> 01:19:43,529
<i>Since the people of the GDR unanimously</i>

709
01:19:43,530 --> 01:19:46,365
<i>desire peace
and the unification of Germany,</i>

710
01:19:46,366 --> 01:19:49,076
<i>Prime Minister Grotewohl
presented the Bonn government...</i>

711
01:19:49,077 --> 01:19:51,537
The professor is coming. Please be seated.

712
01:19:51,538 --> 01:19:54,706
<i>...with proposals for free elections
throughout the whole of Germany.</i>

713
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:57,835
<i>These proposals were rejected
by the Western occupying powers</i>

714
01:19:57,836 --> 01:19:59,253
<i>and the Adenauer government,</i>

715
01:19:59,254 --> 01:20:02,257
<i>in line with
their politics of confrontation.</i>

716
01:20:02,882 --> 01:20:05,467
<i>As a further consequence
of these politics,</i>

717
01:20:05,468 --> 01:20:09,263
<i>the government in Bonn
and the Western occupying powers</i>

718
01:20:09,264 --> 01:20:13,934
<i>have introduced strict border controls
at the demarcation line</i>

719
01:20:13,935 --> 01:20:18,105
<i>in order to emphasize their separation
from the GDR</i>

720
01:20:18,106 --> 01:20:21,609
<i>and thus to perpetuate
the division of Germany.</i>

721
01:20:37,625 --> 01:20:39,627
Thank you. Good day.

722
01:20:42,005 --> 01:20:43,006
Kurt.

723
01:20:44,174 --> 01:20:46,259
I thought you could put your easel...

724
01:20:47,427 --> 01:20:48,510
here.

725
01:20:48,511 --> 01:20:51,638
<i>The lack of any corresponding controls
at GDR borders</i>

726
01:20:51,639 --> 01:20:54,683
<i>has been exploited by the Western powers</i>

727
01:20:54,684 --> 01:20:58,103
<i>to infiltrate our sector
with an ever-increasing number of spies,</i>

728
01:20:58,104 --> 01:21:00,315
<i>terrorists, and smugglers.</i>

729
01:21:03,318 --> 01:21:07,654
<i>Until now, once their criminal activities
have been accomplished,</i>

730
01:21:07,655 --> 01:21:10,741
<i>they have been able to return
without any obstacle</i>

731
01:21:10,742 --> 01:21:14,913
<i>across the demarcation line
to West Germany.</i>

732
01:21:16,706 --> 01:21:22,461
<i>Consequently, we are obliged
to take measures to protect</i>

733
01:21:22,462 --> 01:21:24,463
<i>the peaceful interests</i>

734
01:21:24,464 --> 01:21:29,010
<i>of the population
of the German Democratic Republic.</i>

735
01:21:30,345 --> 01:21:35,475
<i>These measures have been entrusted
to the Ministry of State Security.</i>

736
01:22:01,668 --> 01:22:04,420
That's exactly what I had in mind.
Very good.

737
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:07,215
We'll continue tomorrow at 4:00.

738
01:22:08,841 --> 01:22:11,302
Two sessions should be enough, right?

739
01:22:21,271 --> 01:22:24,107
Why are you looking
at those ancient photos again?

740
01:22:24,774 --> 01:22:28,278
Why does the most idiotic snapshot
have more reality than my painting?

741
01:22:30,613 --> 01:22:32,031
Papa likes it.

742
01:22:32,448 --> 01:22:33,908
That's just it.

743
01:22:36,286 --> 01:22:38,329
Hardly anyone likes photos of themselves.

744
01:22:38,955 --> 01:22:41,040
But everyone's supposed
to like a painting.

745
01:22:41,958 --> 01:22:43,876
So the photograph must be truer.

746
01:22:47,839 --> 01:22:50,133
Why did your father
go to work in Chemnitz anyway?

747
01:22:50,842 --> 01:22:52,885
He was the hospital director here before.

748
01:22:59,517 --> 01:23:01,227
He doesn't want us to talk about it.

749
01:23:06,274 --> 01:23:09,777
During the war, Papa treated
the wives of Goering and Goebbels.

750
01:23:13,948 --> 01:23:15,908
Simply because he's the best gynecologist.

751
01:23:17,076 --> 01:23:19,454
They traveled 200 kilometers from Berlin.

752
01:23:19,871 --> 01:23:23,583
As if no one there was capable
of doing a Pap smear. Just imagine!

753
01:23:25,627 --> 01:23:28,880
As a reward, they made him
an honorary member of the SS.

754
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:30,882
He couldn't refuse.

755
01:23:31,799 --> 01:23:35,093
But after the war,
it was hard to explain to the Russians

756
01:23:35,094 --> 01:23:37,639
that he didn't have anything else
to do with the Nazis.

757
01:23:38,473 --> 01:23:42,644
They combed through all the archives,
but couldn't find anything against him.

758
01:23:52,737 --> 01:23:57,075
Today, the professor called me...
a "Willi Sitte" type of artist.

759
01:23:57,992 --> 01:24:00,369
But that's good. He's successful.

760
01:24:00,370 --> 01:24:01,788
A "Willi Sitte" type.

761
01:24:02,455 --> 01:24:04,332
I think I have to get out of this place.

762
01:24:05,833 --> 01:24:07,085
You don't mean to the West?

763
01:24:10,171 --> 01:24:11,673
You can't be serious.

764
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:16,469
But things are going so well for us here.

765
01:24:20,807 --> 01:24:22,975
I could never abandon Mama.

766
01:24:28,731 --> 01:24:29,941
Kurt!

767
01:24:31,401 --> 01:24:35,362
Your diploma thesis convinced
the committee, and they chose you

768
01:24:35,363 --> 01:24:38,281
to paint the mural
for the new History Museum.

769
01:24:38,282 --> 01:24:40,785
The theme is "Unity of the Working Class."

770
01:24:41,703 --> 01:24:44,247
A task that even a few professors
wouldn't have minded getting.

771
01:24:44,956 --> 01:24:46,749
- A mural?
- Yes.

772
01:24:47,875 --> 01:24:49,501
But I'm not a muralist.

773
01:24:49,502 --> 01:24:51,671
Kurt, we both know you can do it.

774
01:24:53,005 --> 01:24:56,675
No, I'm sorry, it's not for me.
It's pure decoration.

775
01:24:56,676 --> 01:24:59,929
You'd have guaranteed work.
And even money.

776
01:25:01,597 --> 01:25:03,057
It's just not me.

777
01:25:06,602 --> 01:25:08,187
Me, me, me.

778
01:25:31,252 --> 01:25:33,463
No, don't move. Please.

779
01:25:36,048 --> 01:25:38,760
That way,
I can imagine we're a single body.

780
01:25:46,476 --> 01:25:47,977
I'm pregnant.

781
01:25:51,981 --> 01:25:53,900
Then you belong to me completely now.

782
01:25:57,403 --> 01:25:59,530
You belong with me, I mean.

783
01:26:10,416 --> 01:26:12,335
We have to tell them, Ellie.

784
01:26:24,555 --> 01:26:26,933
Maybe we should tell them
we're together first.

785
01:26:28,184 --> 01:26:30,478
To split the shock up into small parts.

786
01:26:33,439 --> 01:26:35,900
I think your mother
already suspects something.

787
01:26:40,112 --> 01:26:42,240
It's not Mama I'm worried about.

788
01:26:43,741 --> 01:26:45,743
It'll hit Papa completely out of the blue.

789
01:26:47,787 --> 01:26:50,122
For him, I'll always be 12 years old.

790
01:26:59,465 --> 01:27:00,967
I think Ellie's pregnant.

791
01:27:05,805 --> 01:27:06,848
What?

792
01:27:07,390 --> 01:27:10,016
The temperature of her hand
has been slightly elevated,

793
01:27:10,017 --> 01:27:11,978
but she shows no symptoms of a cold.

794
01:27:12,812 --> 01:27:16,148
Yesterday she left the room
twice at dinner,

795
01:27:16,732 --> 01:27:19,067
didn't touch her porridge at breakfast,

796
01:27:19,068 --> 01:27:22,363
and grabbed the chair for support
when she got up.

797
01:27:23,406 --> 01:27:25,074
Third month, I'd say.

798
01:27:26,742 --> 01:27:28,201
Maybe the fourth.

799
01:27:28,202 --> 01:27:30,329
My God, she's still a child herself!

800
01:27:31,247 --> 01:27:34,000
The problem isn't her age, but the man.

801
01:27:35,293 --> 01:27:36,586
But who could it be?

802
01:27:39,881 --> 01:27:42,299
Leptosomic, melancholic,

803
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:45,928
son of a man who took his life
because he had to clean a few stairs.

804
01:27:47,054 --> 01:27:49,974
My father would've called
a man like that a "dead loss."

805
01:27:51,559 --> 01:27:54,478
This is not the genetic material
I want for our descendants.

806
01:27:55,104 --> 01:27:56,647
We have to prevent it.

807
01:27:58,983 --> 01:28:00,151
But how?

808
01:28:02,069 --> 01:28:05,364
After 30 years as a gynecologist,
I can tell you one thing.

809
01:28:06,157 --> 01:28:09,952
An abortion has been known
to end almost any dalliance.

810
01:29:21,607 --> 01:29:25,111
No, I don't know that one.
What's the difference?

811
01:29:26,153 --> 01:29:29,156
The psychotic
thinks two and two makes five,

812
01:29:29,532 --> 01:29:32,952
while the neurotic
knows two and two make four.

813
01:29:33,536 --> 01:29:35,121
But it worries him.

814
01:29:43,212 --> 01:29:46,006
There's something we want to tell you.

815
01:29:46,007 --> 01:29:49,176
About the Academy of Art?
I'm always interested in that.

816
01:29:49,593 --> 01:29:52,972
No. Although it's also about the academy.

817
01:29:53,723 --> 01:29:56,976
Kurt has been commissioned
to paint the mural in the History Museum.

818
01:29:58,060 --> 01:29:59,728
Painting walls, after all?

819
01:29:59,729 --> 01:30:03,024
The mural's theme
is "Unity of the Working Class."

820
01:30:04,150 --> 01:30:06,985
And on the subject of unity...

821
01:30:06,986 --> 01:30:08,404
What is it, my child?

822
01:30:09,447 --> 01:30:11,615
Nothing unpleasant, I hope.

823
01:30:12,867 --> 01:30:14,493
My nerves, you know.

824
01:30:16,328 --> 01:30:17,413
We...

825
01:30:18,748 --> 01:30:20,750
We're... together.

826
01:30:22,126 --> 01:30:24,462
You're working on the mural too?

827
01:30:26,213 --> 01:30:29,133
We're a couple.
We have been for some time.

828
01:30:30,134 --> 01:30:32,094
A couple of students?

829
01:30:33,971 --> 01:30:35,723
A couple in a loving relationship.

830
01:30:38,559 --> 01:30:41,937
- And there's something else.
- That's big news.

831
01:30:42,521 --> 01:30:45,565
Yes, and as well as that...

832
01:30:45,566 --> 01:30:47,902
My God, I need to digest this first.

833
01:30:52,907 --> 01:30:55,242
This is so totally unexpected.

834
01:30:56,619 --> 01:30:58,746
Please bring the professor some water!

835
01:31:01,874 --> 01:31:03,375
Thank you.

836
01:31:32,988 --> 01:31:35,074
I'm happy you told us

837
01:31:36,033 --> 01:31:37,535
and told us early.

838
01:31:39,328 --> 01:31:42,206
There's something about Ellie
you need to know.

839
01:31:44,667 --> 01:31:47,545
We didn't want
to worry Ellie unnecessarily,

840
01:31:48,170 --> 01:31:51,006
so we never
really fully explained it to her,

841
01:31:51,340 --> 01:31:52,508
but...

842
01:31:54,468 --> 01:31:58,888
As a little girl, Ellie had
a serious infection of the pelvis.

843
01:31:58,889 --> 01:32:01,474
It left scar tissue in the fallopian tubes

844
01:32:01,475 --> 01:32:04,019
and caused considerable cilia damage.

845
01:32:05,146 --> 01:32:06,230
Cilia?

846
01:32:06,522 --> 01:32:09,190
Cilia are the tiny hairs
in the mucus of the fallopian tubes

847
01:32:09,191 --> 01:32:12,236
which transport
the fertilized egg to the uterus.

848
01:32:14,572 --> 01:32:19,243
We've been looking for a way
to correct her condition surgically.

849
01:32:21,453 --> 01:32:22,663
But if she...

850
01:32:23,789 --> 01:32:26,375
were to become pregnant
before we find one,

851
01:32:27,293 --> 01:32:30,545
she'd be at an extreme risk
of having an extrauterine gravidity,

852
01:32:30,546 --> 01:32:32,882
an ectopic pregnancy.

853
01:32:33,883 --> 01:32:35,843
A tubal pregnancy.

854
01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:39,680
This could lead
to severe internal bleeding.

855
01:32:42,057 --> 01:32:44,560
So I have to warn you...

856
01:32:45,561 --> 01:32:47,979
though not for the same reason

857
01:32:47,980 --> 01:32:50,566
that fathers normally warn men
pursuing their daughters,

858
01:32:51,150 --> 01:32:55,696
not to become intimate with her
until we've relieved this condition.

859
01:32:56,071 --> 01:32:58,324
A pregnancy at this point in time...

860
01:32:59,325 --> 01:33:01,410
could be life-threatening for Ellie.

861
01:33:08,667 --> 01:33:11,754
You do understand? Life-threatening.

862
01:33:22,473 --> 01:33:24,308
And if she were pregnant already?

863
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:30,481
Then I'd have to examine her immediately.

864
01:33:59,885 --> 01:34:01,470
I must act immediately.

865
01:34:02,346 --> 01:34:05,808
The pregnancy is considerably
more advanced than I feared.

866
01:34:06,225 --> 01:34:07,977
It's already the third month.

867
01:34:12,606 --> 01:34:13,816
An abortion?

868
01:34:14,275 --> 01:34:18,195
If I don't remove the fetus immediately,
she won't survive the pregnancy.

869
01:34:19,196 --> 01:34:20,364
Here?

870
01:34:22,032 --> 01:34:23,951
We have a reputation to uphold.

871
01:34:26,662 --> 01:34:28,414
Is it really the only way?

872
01:34:28,998 --> 01:34:30,164
Really?

873
01:34:30,165 --> 01:34:32,167
Do you doubt my professional ability?

874
01:34:33,043 --> 01:34:34,795
Would I subject myself to this,

875
01:34:35,254 --> 01:34:37,715
and my daughter,
if it were not absolutely necessary?

876
01:35:29,266 --> 01:35:32,102
He had an SS uniform tailor-made.

877
01:35:34,271 --> 01:35:38,317
For hours he would change positions
in front of the mirror...

878
01:35:39,818 --> 01:35:42,404
<i>trying different poses
to find the best one.</i>

879
01:35:44,656 --> 01:35:46,784
<i>He didn't care that I could see him.</i>

880
01:35:49,828 --> 01:35:51,246
<i>I was just a little girl.</i>

881
01:36:02,674 --> 01:36:05,219
<i>There was a skull on his cap.</i>

882
01:36:06,970 --> 01:36:07,971
<i>In silver.</i>

883
01:36:09,598 --> 01:36:10,974
<i>A skull.</i>

884
01:36:18,899 --> 01:36:21,068
<i>A doctor is supposed to heal people.</i>

885
01:36:23,570 --> 01:36:25,406
He's supposed to heal.

886
01:36:31,412 --> 01:36:33,914
Am I always going to be at his mercy?

887
01:36:38,001 --> 01:36:40,711
...a gifted doctor, a humanist,

888
01:36:40,712 --> 01:36:44,340
an active co-creator
of our Socialist Republic.

889
01:36:44,341 --> 01:36:49,220
And a fine example
for all members of his profession.

890
01:36:49,221 --> 01:36:53,766
For these reasons, today,
December 11, the GDR's Health Care Day,

891
01:36:53,767 --> 01:36:56,311
I'm proud to present him
with the Robert Koch Medal

892
01:36:56,645 --> 01:37:01,275
and the title
"Distinguished Doctor of the People."

893
01:37:16,790 --> 01:37:20,836
Thank you, Comrade Minister,
for the kind words, which I don't deserve.

894
01:37:21,170 --> 01:37:25,424
As a doctor and a member of society,
I am merely doing my duty.

895
01:37:26,216 --> 01:37:30,429
I'm simply a cog in the huge machine
of the international socialist movement.

896
01:37:31,513 --> 01:37:33,431
Just as the painter

897
01:37:33,432 --> 01:37:37,311
of this far too flattering portrait of me
is only a small cog,

898
01:37:37,811 --> 01:37:42,024
his style indistinguishable
from the other painters here.

899
01:37:42,608 --> 01:37:46,445
As all are just small cogs
in a large apparatus,

900
01:37:46,862 --> 01:37:52,326
which with the help of the Soviet Union
is heading steadily towards a joint goal...

901
01:37:52,743 --> 01:37:54,118
Communism.

902
01:37:54,119 --> 01:37:55,120
Thank you.

903
01:38:37,538 --> 01:38:38,997
What did he want?

904
01:38:40,749 --> 01:38:44,169
I'm to report to KGB headquarters
tomorrow. That's all he said.

905
01:38:52,970 --> 01:38:56,932
Looks like that plan didn't work either.
They're even closer than before.

906
01:38:58,475 --> 01:38:59,935
Patience, Martha.

907
01:39:00,644 --> 01:39:02,062
Just a bit of patience.

908
01:39:31,466 --> 01:39:34,135
General Murawjow,
Professor Seeband, as per your orders.

909
01:39:34,136 --> 01:39:35,596
You may go.

910
01:39:46,773 --> 01:39:47,858
Carl!

911
01:39:54,865 --> 01:39:55,991
Carl.

912
01:39:57,326 --> 01:40:00,037
Wait, I want to show you something.

913
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:11,673
Come and sit down.

914
01:40:22,267 --> 01:40:25,020
Carl, I'm being transferred.

915
01:40:25,771 --> 01:40:27,230
Back to Moscow.

916
01:40:28,148 --> 01:40:30,442
I won't be able to protect you any longer.

917
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:33,654
All the others have been captured.

918
01:40:34,237 --> 01:40:36,365
We are still hunting for Burghart Kroll

919
01:40:36,823 --> 01:40:42,244
and the "medical coordinator
of the Dresden region

920
01:40:42,245 --> 01:40:47,626
for the euthanasia program,"
who is still officially unknown.

921
01:40:48,126 --> 01:40:51,295
I can't guarantee that my successor

922
01:40:51,296 --> 01:40:55,300
won't question doctors
and nurses again in this matter.

923
01:40:56,718 --> 01:41:00,347
You should leave the country as well
and never come back.

924
01:41:00,847 --> 01:41:04,518
Apply for an emigration permit
for you and your wife.

925
01:41:05,268 --> 01:41:07,229
It will be approved.

926
01:41:08,105 --> 01:41:11,358
No one will suspect the truth in the West.

927
01:41:12,776 --> 01:41:15,445
Let's hope our side doesn't, either.

928
01:41:19,825 --> 01:41:20,909
Carl.

929
01:41:23,829 --> 01:41:27,749
You can't tell me anything about Kroll?

930
01:41:29,793 --> 01:41:31,169
Where he is?

931
01:41:32,671 --> 01:41:35,632
Who else was at your meetings?

932
01:41:39,845 --> 01:41:42,764
You'd be helping me a great deal.

933
01:41:48,061 --> 01:41:49,730
I never met the man.

934
01:41:50,647 --> 01:41:52,149
I don't know anything about him.

935
01:42:06,580 --> 01:42:10,792
We shall never meet again, my friend.

936
01:42:12,002 --> 01:42:15,172
I hope I have repaid my debt.

937
01:42:27,893 --> 01:42:29,144
You may go.

938
01:42:35,567 --> 01:42:38,111
Dear Ellie, dear Kurt.

939
01:42:39,529 --> 01:42:42,616
So now you have been
my son-in-law for two hours.

940
01:42:43,450 --> 01:42:45,534
I'll be leaving my daughter in your hands

941
01:42:45,535 --> 01:42:48,246
when we leave the GDR
at the end of the month.

942
01:42:49,998 --> 01:42:53,210
There is only one thing I'd like
to tell you for your life's journey.

943
01:42:54,544 --> 01:42:57,464
It's not enough to be "good."

944
01:42:58,715 --> 01:43:01,967
I've seen many men who were just "good"

945
01:43:01,968 --> 01:43:05,764
be passed over, dispossessed,
even eradicated.

946
01:43:08,016 --> 01:43:10,685
If you want security in this world,

947
01:43:11,061 --> 01:43:14,564
no matter what you do,
you have to be the best.

948
01:43:15,565 --> 01:43:17,275
Not one of the best.

949
01:43:18,693 --> 01:43:20,195
The best.

950
01:43:22,447 --> 01:43:23,740
To the married couple!

951
01:43:24,991 --> 01:43:26,159
Cheers.

952
01:43:33,542 --> 01:43:34,668
Cheers.

953
01:43:37,671 --> 01:43:41,382
"...thus I'm now in Oldenburg,
in the Sanderbusch Clinic,

954
01:43:41,383 --> 01:43:45,971
with every prospect of taking charge
when Erkner retires two years from now.

955
01:43:46,638 --> 01:43:49,850
Take care of yourself, your Papa."

956
01:43:50,892 --> 01:43:53,270
It looks as though
he's landed on his feet again.

957
01:44:38,189 --> 01:44:40,358
How much would you give me
for the Wartburg?

958
01:44:40,984 --> 01:44:42,152
Are you out of your mind?

959
01:44:42,777 --> 01:44:45,737
Do you know how long an ordinary mortal
has to wait to get a car like that?

960
01:44:46,364 --> 01:44:48,199
I just don't like it anymore.

961
01:44:50,493 --> 01:44:51,494
300 marks?

962
01:44:55,874 --> 01:44:58,960
Kurt.
They don't even paint anymore in the West.

963
01:45:00,587 --> 01:45:02,172
They consider painting bourgeois.

964
01:45:03,423 --> 01:45:06,343
Don't they find "bourgeois" good?

965
01:45:07,052 --> 01:45:08,720
Oh, what do I know?

966
01:45:11,139 --> 01:45:14,225
Of course we all want to get rid of you.
Of course.

967
01:45:15,185 --> 01:45:16,810
But you've got a life here.

968
01:45:16,811 --> 01:45:20,106
You have money. You're becoming famous.

969
01:45:20,732 --> 01:45:24,569
I mean, girls have gone to bed with me
because I'm your assistant.

970
01:45:25,487 --> 01:45:27,864
You can handle the apparatchiks
like nobody else.

971
01:45:29,032 --> 01:45:31,952
You're about to turn 30,
not that young anymore.

972
01:45:32,535 --> 01:45:33,536
You're...

973
01:45:34,537 --> 01:45:35,580
Why?

974
01:45:36,247 --> 01:45:37,624
Because none of that matters.

975
01:45:38,416 --> 01:45:39,668
Then what does matter?

976
01:45:41,503 --> 01:45:42,879
The truth.

977
01:45:44,381 --> 01:45:46,007
And who says what's true?

978
01:45:46,758 --> 01:45:49,010
Me, me, me.

979
01:46:02,565 --> 01:46:03,566
260?

980
01:46:04,109 --> 01:46:05,110
Fine.

981
01:46:10,448 --> 01:46:11,658
Do you need canvases?

982
01:46:12,534 --> 01:46:13,701
You've got some?

983
01:46:13,702 --> 01:46:16,036
In my studio, with pictures on them.

984
01:46:16,037 --> 01:46:17,122
What?

985
01:46:17,831 --> 01:46:21,292
Paint over all of them, please.
I never want to see them again.

986
01:46:22,627 --> 01:46:24,963
Believe me,
nothing I've ever painted is right.

987
01:46:28,633 --> 01:46:32,720
- ...the idea of Socialist Realism.
- Visit from Normannenstraße.

988
01:46:32,721 --> 01:46:34,305
What about the murals?

989
01:46:35,348 --> 01:46:36,641
You can't destroy them.

990
01:46:36,933 --> 01:46:39,185
...depicted as an unstoppable train.

991
01:46:46,276 --> 01:46:48,277
Comrades, were you in charge of...

992
01:46:48,278 --> 01:46:50,154
Other people
will take care of that for me.

993
01:46:50,155 --> 01:46:51,865
We've been here right from the start

994
01:46:52,532 --> 01:46:55,994
and can testify that
all involved have impeccable views.

995
01:46:57,662 --> 01:47:00,415
MARCH 13, 1961

996
01:47:03,043 --> 01:47:06,046
BERLIN FRIEDRICHSTRAßE STATION

997
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:50,548
Stop. Stay there!

998
01:47:55,386 --> 01:47:56,595
What's in that suitcase?

999
01:47:56,596 --> 01:48:00,058
Those are things
that belong to my brother-in-law.

1000
01:48:18,618 --> 01:48:22,372
<i>Incoming train to Zoologischer Garten.</i>

1001
01:48:26,459 --> 01:48:27,919
<i>Stand back, please.</i>

1002
01:48:39,013 --> 01:48:40,682
They make it almost too easy.

1003
01:48:41,516 --> 01:48:42,809
Not for much longer.

1004
01:48:45,937 --> 01:48:48,648
<i>Next station, Zoologischer Garten.</i>

1005
01:49:11,129 --> 01:49:13,380
- Your name?
- Barnert, Kurt.

1006
01:49:13,381 --> 01:49:14,632
Please fill this out.

1007
01:49:15,216 --> 01:49:17,927
Your beds are over there.
I'll come to you.

1008
01:49:19,179 --> 01:49:21,723
Mrs. Müller? Mrs. Müller!

1009
01:49:36,696 --> 01:49:38,406
- Thank you.
- Good day.

1010
01:49:43,995 --> 01:49:45,288
- There you go.
- Thank you.

1011
01:50:38,633 --> 01:50:39,884
<i>Dear Professor.</i>

1012
01:50:40,927 --> 01:50:43,429
<i>By the time you read this,
I shall be in the West.</i>

1013
01:50:44,472 --> 01:50:49,102
<i>I couldn't talk to you about it before. It
would've involved you in a criminal act.</i>

1014
01:50:50,186 --> 01:50:52,187
<i>You were always very good to me,</i>

1015
01:50:52,188 --> 01:50:55,816
<i>so I hope you will believe me
when I tell you</i>

1016
01:50:55,817 --> 01:50:57,777
<i>that I haven't made this decision lightly.</i>

1017
01:52:02,842 --> 01:52:04,344
Hello. I'm Kurt.

1018
01:52:05,636 --> 01:52:06,846
Should I come back later?

1019
01:52:07,096 --> 01:52:08,264
No, come in.

1020
01:52:09,265 --> 01:52:10,433
Klaus, stay still.

1021
01:52:12,352 --> 01:52:15,021
You'll spoil your father's
birthday present for Mommy.

1022
01:52:22,612 --> 01:52:23,821
How old are you again?

1023
01:52:24,238 --> 01:52:26,741
Twenty-nine. Almost 30.

1024
01:52:27,450 --> 01:52:28,743
You look younger.

1025
01:52:34,457 --> 01:52:36,625
As I said, Munich's a good idea.

1026
01:52:36,626 --> 01:52:40,879
People there have plenty of money and
constantly need portraits and landscapes.

1027
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:42,215
The same goes for Hamburg.

1028
01:52:44,425 --> 01:52:47,428
What I'd advise you against is Dusseldorf.

1029
01:52:48,388 --> 01:52:49,555
Dusseldorf?

1030
01:52:50,556 --> 01:52:53,476
It's all modern art there.
You know, avant-garde.

1031
01:52:54,143 --> 01:52:57,020
If you didn't study at their academy,
you don't stand a chance.

1032
01:52:57,021 --> 01:52:58,231
It's a kind of mafia.

1033
01:52:59,482 --> 01:53:01,109
Munich is good.

1034
01:53:01,734 --> 01:53:03,611
Hamburg is good.

1035
01:53:04,112 --> 01:53:06,072
Berlin is middling.

1036
01:53:07,115 --> 01:53:08,533
As you can see for yourself.

1037
01:53:08,950 --> 01:53:10,118
Klaus, stay still.

1038
01:53:23,256 --> 01:53:25,590
DUSSELDORF ART ACADEMY
OPEN HOUSE

1039
01:53:25,591 --> 01:53:28,803
Good day. My name is Kurt Barnert.

1040
01:53:29,262 --> 01:53:31,431
I called about a guided tour.

1041
01:53:48,823 --> 01:53:51,576
He punched him in the nose
in the middle of the lecture.

1042
01:53:54,036 --> 01:53:56,663
He gave the Hitler salute!

1043
01:53:56,664 --> 01:54:00,042
- Claimed it was just a provocation.
- How tasteless!

1044
01:54:00,751 --> 01:54:03,628
...paid 9,000 marks for a lump of soil.

1045
01:54:03,629 --> 01:54:04,796
Unbelievable!

1046
01:54:04,797 --> 01:54:06,382
You're still under 26, I hope?

1047
01:54:08,968 --> 01:54:10,386
Good, and what do you want to do?

1048
01:54:11,053 --> 01:54:13,347
Performances? Installations? Sculpture?

1049
01:54:13,973 --> 01:54:16,809
- Well, to be honest, painting.
- "Painting"?

1050
01:54:19,103 --> 01:54:23,607
No offense, I'm from the East myself.
Mecklenburg. Harry, Harry Preußer.

1051
01:54:23,608 --> 01:54:24,650
Kurt.

1052
01:54:25,818 --> 01:54:28,029
Nobody here paints anymore.

1053
01:54:29,822 --> 01:54:32,825
People want something new. An idea.

1054
01:54:52,595 --> 01:54:55,472
- An idea?
- Yes. But not something like that.

1055
01:54:55,473 --> 01:54:58,392
Something new,
or at least in new packaging.

1056
01:54:59,936 --> 01:55:04,022
Like Yves Klein, who says,
"I'm claiming ultramarine for myself.

1057
01:55:04,023 --> 01:55:05,399
I'm even going to patent it.

1058
01:55:05,983 --> 01:55:09,361
It's now called Yves Klein Blue.
I'll only express myself in it.

1059
01:55:09,362 --> 01:55:12,573
I'll paint the breasts
of a beautiful woman with Yves Klein Blue.

1060
01:55:13,241 --> 01:55:16,993
She'll smear the paint
on the breasts of another beautiful woman.

1061
01:55:16,994 --> 01:55:20,623
I'll paint sponges with Yves Klein Blue
and use it to stick them to canvases."

1062
01:55:29,423 --> 01:55:31,743
Of course, it's no good
if someone else had the idea first.

1063
01:55:32,843 --> 01:55:35,471
Lucio Fontana's been slashing
canvases for six years.

1064
01:55:36,430 --> 01:55:38,975
But Katrin is hot as hell,
so she can do whatever she likes.

1065
01:55:47,400 --> 01:55:49,902
Let us focus not on

1066
01:55:50,736 --> 01:55:53,155
what is obvious,
but on things more spurious.

1067
01:55:53,698 --> 01:55:55,575
Let profoundness emerge.

1068
01:55:56,033 --> 01:55:57,785
That's Adrian Schimmel.

1069
01:55:58,953 --> 01:56:00,663
The name says it all... "Adrian Mold."

1070
01:56:01,622 --> 01:56:04,583
His real name is Adrian Finck,
son of the Mannesmann CEO.

1071
01:56:04,584 --> 01:56:07,962
A little snot.
But he can talk, that's for sure.

1072
01:56:09,380 --> 01:56:11,340
But is the wallpaper idea enough?

1073
01:56:12,675 --> 01:56:15,761
To put it differently, what does
the entire composition say to you?

1074
01:56:17,430 --> 01:56:19,681
Yes, I think it's very nice.

1075
01:56:19,682 --> 01:56:24,186
But it's still what you might call...
wallpaper.

1076
01:56:24,645 --> 01:56:26,480
- I'm so sorry.
- Yes.

1077
01:56:27,064 --> 01:56:28,065
Yes.

1078
01:56:28,608 --> 01:56:30,943
But you see, it only looks that way.

1079
01:56:31,444 --> 01:56:33,862
That's what we artists are searching for.

1080
01:56:33,863 --> 01:56:36,407
What's hidden behind the decorative.

1081
01:56:37,074 --> 01:56:40,411
Look.
The emptiness, expressed by the white,

1082
01:56:40,703 --> 01:56:42,538
which I placed between the stencils.

1083
01:56:42,955 --> 01:56:44,497
The banality

1084
01:56:44,498 --> 01:56:47,543
represented by the recurring pattern
I applied to my work.

1085
01:56:48,169 --> 01:56:51,297
The senseless stridency
visible in the neon colors.

1086
01:56:51,756 --> 01:56:53,758
That's exactly what has brought you here.

1087
01:56:54,884 --> 01:56:59,138
You have a deep sense of the artistic.
Otherwise you wouldn't have ended up here.

1088
01:56:59,889 --> 01:57:01,891
Your friends see pretty wallpaper.

1089
01:57:02,391 --> 01:57:04,143
You see the dimension behind it.

1090
01:57:04,727 --> 01:57:05,853
Wonderful.

1091
01:57:07,480 --> 01:57:08,606
And...

1092
01:57:09,565 --> 01:57:12,193
is it possible to purchase
something like this?

1093
01:57:14,654 --> 01:57:17,657
It is.
That's what's so magnificent about art.

1094
01:57:21,535 --> 01:57:25,164
Money makes money. You know how it goes.

1095
01:57:25,581 --> 01:57:28,376
But an artist shouldn't have
to talk about his work like that.

1096
01:57:28,876 --> 01:57:33,129
He wants to prove to his successful family
that he's a success even without them.

1097
01:57:33,130 --> 01:57:34,757
Money is all that counts for them.

1098
01:57:36,133 --> 01:57:40,262
I want to prove to my unsuccessful family
that I'm a success in spite of them.

1099
01:57:40,721 --> 01:57:42,431
Money is all that counts there, too.

1100
01:57:42,765 --> 01:57:44,684
Families. What a load of crap!

1101
01:57:49,105 --> 01:57:52,857
But you must be 26 at most
when you have the idea, or forget it!

1102
01:57:52,858 --> 01:57:54,109
Why?

1103
01:57:54,110 --> 01:57:58,072
Just think. Picasso was 26 when he painted
Les <i>Demoiselles</i> d'Avignon.

1104
01:57:58,572 --> 01:58:02,158
Duchamp was 25 when he painted
<i>Nude Descending</i> a Staircase.

1105
01:58:02,159 --> 01:58:04,495
And Michelangelo was 24
when he did the Pietà.

1106
01:58:05,496 --> 01:58:07,289
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

1107
01:58:09,792 --> 01:58:12,252
- What do you call it?
- Potato Pendulum.

1108
01:58:12,253 --> 01:58:13,546
No more dots?

1109
01:58:14,213 --> 01:58:16,173
I'm more interested in potatoes now.

1110
01:58:17,883 --> 01:58:20,636
This is Kurt. He's from the East, too.
Wants to study here.

1111
01:58:22,221 --> 01:58:25,558
I guess you've already had to listen
to Harry's speech about "the idea"?

1112
01:58:25,975 --> 01:58:27,309
You don't believe it?

1113
01:58:28,060 --> 01:58:29,540
I'm really much more interested in...

1114
01:58:30,938 --> 01:58:32,022
potatoes.

1115
01:58:33,065 --> 01:58:34,650
Come on, before you get corrupted.

1116
01:58:39,447 --> 01:58:40,905
<i>Arendt No.</i>

1117
01:58:40,906 --> 01:58:42,450
What he wants, nobody knows.

1118
01:58:43,033 --> 01:58:44,659
He used to do everything

1119
01:58:44,660 --> 01:58:48,329
in big dots, all the same color,
that he printed on boards.

1120
01:58:48,330 --> 01:58:49,874
Could have been a real idea.

1121
01:58:50,332 --> 01:58:51,459
And now that.

1122
01:58:51,917 --> 01:58:54,545
In two months, it'll be something
completely different again.

1123
01:58:58,883 --> 01:59:00,217
Our professor...

1124
01:59:01,469 --> 01:59:04,430
Antonius van Verten.
Guess you've heard of him, even in Saxony.

1125
01:59:06,932 --> 01:59:08,058
A true original.

1126
01:59:08,684 --> 01:59:11,228
Though I'm sure
he'd prefer the term "legend."

1127
01:59:11,687 --> 01:59:12,980
He always wears that hat.

1128
01:59:15,149 --> 01:59:18,694
One time a very pretty student seduced
him, just to see him without the hat.

1129
01:59:20,446 --> 01:59:22,156
He kept it on, even in bed.

1130
01:59:26,202 --> 01:59:28,078
Only works with felt and grease.

1131
01:59:28,621 --> 01:59:29,705
And Why?

1132
01:59:30,498 --> 01:59:33,334
That remains his big, legendary secret.

1133
01:59:35,044 --> 01:59:38,339
We have to go to all his lectures,
but he never looks at anything we do.

1134
01:59:39,423 --> 01:59:42,343
He says you're the only one
who knows if you're doing it right.

1135
01:59:42,760 --> 01:59:44,720
I think he simply doesn't care about us.

1136
01:59:45,554 --> 01:59:47,431
Well, we don't care about him either.

1137
01:59:48,432 --> 01:59:50,850
But whether you're accepted,
or get a studio,

1138
01:59:50,851 --> 01:59:53,145
it's all completely up to that maniac.

1139
01:59:56,106 --> 01:59:58,108
Come on, he's not really that interesting.

1140
02:00:01,320 --> 02:00:04,824
BARNERT, KURT. AGE 26.

1141
02:00:08,118 --> 02:00:09,954
You haven't submitted a portfolio.

1142
02:00:10,913 --> 02:00:12,665
I couldn't bring anything with me.

1143
02:00:13,707 --> 02:00:15,167
What have you done up to now?

1144
02:00:17,086 --> 02:00:18,128
Painting.

1145
02:00:18,504 --> 02:00:20,506
- In East Germany?
- Yes.

1146
02:00:21,215 --> 02:00:23,050
Socialist Realism.

1147
02:00:26,804 --> 02:00:30,056
WALL SURROUNDS EAST BERLIN!
TEAR GAS AND TANKS

1148
02:00:30,057 --> 02:00:32,643
So now they really have built a wall.

1149
02:00:34,144 --> 02:00:35,354
Did you feel that coming?

1150
02:00:38,440 --> 02:00:42,069
"Nobody has the intention."
It usually means the opposite is true.

1151
02:00:45,114 --> 02:00:48,075
But somehow it's almost art, that wall.

1152
02:00:49,451 --> 02:00:51,704
A piece of landscape art.

1153
02:00:52,288 --> 02:00:54,790
The craftsmanship involved is secondary.

1154
02:00:55,291 --> 02:00:57,418
Hundreds of thousands
have a problem with it.

1155
02:00:58,502 --> 02:01:00,462
Consistent German madness.

1156
02:01:05,885 --> 02:01:07,970
What do you like in art?

1157
02:01:15,936 --> 02:01:17,897
Don't like talking about yourself, do you?

1158
02:01:20,858 --> 02:01:23,611
But your eyes tell me
that you've seen more than any of us.

1159
02:01:31,869 --> 02:01:33,704
GRANTED ADMISSION

1160
02:01:36,749 --> 02:01:37,875
STUDIO SPACE

1161
02:01:39,001 --> 02:01:41,962
These are the only conditions for you,
like everyone else.

1162
02:01:42,421 --> 02:01:45,466
That you come to the lectures.

1163
02:01:46,216 --> 02:01:48,760
And that you never ask me

1164
02:01:48,761 --> 02:01:52,848
to look at anything you do.

1165
02:01:56,602 --> 02:01:57,811
Agreed?

1166
02:01:59,980 --> 02:02:02,900
In any case, you're the only one
who knows if it's good or not.

1167
02:02:23,003 --> 02:02:25,464
One step forward, two steps back.

1168
02:02:26,006 --> 02:02:27,216
Oh, come on.

1169
02:02:28,092 --> 02:02:30,636
You can do anything you like here.

1170
02:02:31,595 --> 02:02:33,597
If I only knew what that was.

1171
02:02:42,523 --> 02:02:43,691
SPD?

1172
02:02:44,108 --> 02:02:45,984
PROSPERITY FOR ALL!

1173
02:02:45,985 --> 02:02:47,318
NO EXPERIMENTS!

1174
02:02:47,319 --> 02:02:48,654
CDU?

1175
02:02:49,113 --> 02:02:51,489
- Who will you vote for?
- CDU!

1176
02:02:51,490 --> 02:02:53,574
- FDP!
- German Peace Union!

1177
02:02:53,575 --> 02:02:54,993
They're criminals.

1178
02:02:54,994 --> 02:02:57,413
- As if they'd do it any better.
- SPD!

1179
02:02:57,830 --> 02:02:59,373
Don't vote for anyone.

1180
02:03:00,916 --> 02:03:02,710
Never vote for another party again.

1181
02:03:03,627 --> 02:03:04,837
Vote for art.

1182
02:03:05,713 --> 02:03:07,423
It's either-or.

1183
02:03:09,216 --> 02:03:12,011
In art only, freedom is not an illusion.

1184
02:03:13,262 --> 02:03:16,432
After the Nazi catastrophe,
only the artist can give people

1185
02:03:16,890 --> 02:03:19,184
back their sense of freedom.

1186
02:03:20,269 --> 02:03:23,022
Every individual,
whether he's a garbage man

1187
02:03:23,731 --> 02:03:27,568
or a farmer,
has the chance to be an artist...

1188
02:03:28,610 --> 02:03:33,407
if he develops his own subjective
abilities without external guidelines.

1189
02:03:34,074 --> 02:03:35,826
If you aren't free...

1190
02:03:36,994 --> 02:03:40,247
completely free, then nobody else will be.

1191
02:03:41,248 --> 02:03:45,127
By making yourselves free,
you are liberating the world.

1192
02:03:46,420 --> 02:03:48,297
You are priests.

1193
02:03:49,298 --> 02:03:50,924
You are revolutionaries.

1194
02:03:51,633 --> 02:03:53,135
You are liberators.

1195
02:03:55,471 --> 02:03:57,306
Make your burnt offerings!

1196
02:05:06,125 --> 02:05:08,335
Don't tell me you've joined the slashers.

1197
02:05:28,188 --> 02:05:29,773
That's almost an idea.

1198
02:05:30,983 --> 02:05:32,109
You learn fast.

1199
02:08:00,966 --> 02:08:02,592
I lost it.

1200
02:08:22,946 --> 02:08:24,448
I went to see the doctor.

1201
02:08:24,948 --> 02:08:26,992
I won't be able to have children.

1202
02:08:31,788 --> 02:08:33,749
And you know what he said?

1203
02:08:35,917 --> 02:08:37,461
It was the abortion.

1204
02:08:38,253 --> 02:08:39,838
Not cilia damage.

1205
02:08:42,549 --> 02:08:44,801
The supporting structures
have been damaged.

1206
02:08:46,678 --> 02:08:48,764
"Cervical insufficiency."

1207
02:08:51,266 --> 02:08:53,685
We're never going to make it
past the third month.

1208
02:08:59,816 --> 02:09:02,069
Because he wanted to keep it so pure...

1209
02:09:03,653 --> 02:09:06,490
he only succeeded in extinguishing
his own bloodline.

1210
02:09:15,707 --> 02:09:18,168
We won't have any children, Kurt.

1211
02:09:36,395 --> 02:09:37,813
Your pictures...

1212
02:09:38,522 --> 02:09:41,066
Your pictures have to be our children,
okay?

1213
02:09:45,904 --> 02:09:47,364
Good.

1214
02:10:16,184 --> 02:10:17,310
Yes...

1215
02:10:19,729 --> 02:10:23,066
Last time we went over...

1216
02:10:27,821 --> 02:10:29,781
No.No, no.

1217
02:10:44,463 --> 02:10:47,007
Have you all studied Lehmbruck?

1218
02:10:51,261 --> 02:10:53,346
Better to look at this with the episcope.

1219
02:11:02,147 --> 02:11:03,773
So, Lehmbruck.

1220
02:11:04,941 --> 02:11:10,363
He said that each work of art must retain
something from the first days of Creation.

1221
02:11:11,198 --> 02:11:12,324
As if...

1222
02:11:18,914 --> 02:11:20,916
Almost as if it were still divine...

1223
02:11:22,167 --> 02:11:23,835
As if it were only just emerging...

1224
02:11:25,170 --> 02:11:29,049
from the primeval mass, from the rib...

1225
02:11:30,926 --> 02:11:31,968
No.

1226
02:11:32,886 --> 02:11:35,012
No, a different approach.

1227
02:11:35,013 --> 02:11:39,058
Has anyone had an insight this week?

1228
02:11:39,059 --> 02:11:40,435
A realization...

1229
02:11:42,020 --> 02:11:44,147
you'd perhaps like to share?

1230
02:11:53,532 --> 02:11:54,908
Lottery numbers.

1231
02:11:57,327 --> 02:12:00,497
No, really. The lottery numbers.

1232
02:12:02,040 --> 02:12:04,459
If I tell you six numbers at random...

1233
02:12:04,751 --> 02:12:11,006
5, 7, 23, 29, 44, 11...

1234
02:12:11,007 --> 02:12:13,343
that's just stupid.

1235
02:12:14,302 --> 02:12:17,722
But if I read you the winning numbers
from the lottery...

1236
02:12:18,265 --> 02:12:19,558
May I?

1237
02:12:24,312 --> 02:12:31,312
"2, 17, 19, 25, 45, 48."

1238
02:12:33,113 --> 02:12:37,576
Suddenly they have a true quality,
something imperative,

1239
02:12:38,243 --> 02:12:40,495
almost beautiful.

1240
02:12:46,835 --> 02:12:48,003
That was it.

1241
02:12:49,462 --> 02:12:52,966
That was my... insight.

1242
02:13:09,899 --> 02:13:13,069
You can go. I have nothing for you today.

1243
02:13:16,281 --> 02:13:18,116
Kurt, would you come here for a minute?

1244
02:13:37,010 --> 02:13:38,011
Yes?

1245
02:13:38,345 --> 02:13:40,430
I'd like to see your art.

1246
02:13:42,140 --> 02:13:43,224
When?

1247
02:13:43,808 --> 02:13:47,312
Whenever you like, and if you like.

1248
02:13:50,023 --> 02:13:51,566
Just let me know.

1249
02:14:02,702 --> 02:14:04,454
What is there to think about?

1250
02:14:06,164 --> 02:14:08,707
If he likes your art,
you'll get a gallery.

1251
02:14:08,708 --> 02:14:11,378
- Then you can buy your girlfriend a car.
- I'm married.

1252
02:14:12,087 --> 02:14:14,172
Then you can buy your wife
and your girlfriend a oar.

1253
02:14:17,092 --> 02:14:19,969
I just don't know
if what I'm doing is good enough.

1254
02:14:21,262 --> 02:14:22,847
Somehow it isn't.

1255
02:14:24,766 --> 02:14:26,267
But it's all subjective anyway.

1256
02:14:27,102 --> 02:14:29,145
And if it weren't subjective,
it'd be craft.

1257
02:14:30,605 --> 02:14:32,565
It's also a matter of luck, you know?

1258
02:14:33,775 --> 02:14:37,195
He's interested in your work,
for whatever reason. So you're in luck.

1259
02:14:38,697 --> 02:14:43,992
He doesn't want to be wrong. He's ready
to see something brilliant in your work.

1260
02:14:43,993 --> 02:14:45,370
Don't stand in your own way.

1261
02:15:04,139 --> 02:15:06,141
It's good, your work. Really.

1262
02:15:06,975 --> 02:15:08,101
It's good.

1263
02:16:11,164 --> 02:16:14,209
During the war,
I was a Luftwaffe radio operator.

1264
02:16:15,418 --> 02:16:18,379
I was a terrible radio operator,

1265
02:16:19,172 --> 02:16:22,174
and my pilot was a terrible pilot.

1266
02:16:22,175 --> 02:16:24,260
Well, we only had four weeks training.

1267
02:16:25,512 --> 02:16:28,973
We were shot down
on our second sortie over the Crimea.

1268
02:16:30,058 --> 02:16:31,893
The pilot was killed immediately.

1269
02:16:49,369 --> 02:16:53,414
<i>Tatar nomads recovered me
from the wreckage</i>

1270
02:16:54,374 --> 02:16:57,043
<i>with burns
that really should have killed me.</i>

1271
02:16:59,712 --> 02:17:01,089
<i>These peasants,</i>

1272
02:17:01,548 --> 02:17:05,176
the very same peasants I was supposed
to bomb, pulled me out of the wreckage...

1273
02:17:06,845 --> 02:17:09,848
and looked after me as best they could.

1274
02:17:12,141 --> 02:17:14,269
They rubbed grease into my wounds...

1275
02:17:15,770 --> 02:17:17,730
and wrapped me in felt blankets.

1276
02:17:27,073 --> 02:17:28,783
<i>I stayed with them for a year.</i>

1277
02:17:29,158 --> 02:17:32,120
<i>Then I surrendered to the Americans
as a POW.</i>

1278
02:17:49,596 --> 02:17:52,557
If I ask myself what I truly know,

1279
02:17:53,349 --> 02:17:55,810
what I've truly experienced in life,

1280
02:17:56,603 --> 02:17:59,772
what I can claim without lying...

1281
02:18:02,025 --> 02:18:04,777
it's the grease on my skin.

1282
02:18:05,612 --> 02:18:09,657
The home that is grease and felt.

1283
02:18:11,451 --> 02:18:17,122
When other people tell me about love...
for their wives, for their children,

1284
02:18:17,123 --> 02:18:20,460
or about sex, I know what they mean...

1285
02:18:21,669 --> 02:18:25,548
only because I experienced
grease and felt on my skin.

1286
02:18:32,055 --> 02:18:33,723
My life until then was uneventful.

1287
02:18:35,016 --> 02:18:37,142
My childhood was happy and sheltered.

1288
02:18:37,143 --> 02:18:39,228
A couple of slaps across the ears,
not many.

1289
02:18:40,313 --> 02:18:41,856
My teachers liked me.

1290
02:18:43,066 --> 02:18:45,068
I wanted to be a businessman, like my dad.

1291
02:18:45,360 --> 02:18:47,236
I had no "artistic talent."

1292
02:18:48,988 --> 02:18:52,574
And my life since was pretty uneventful.

1293
02:18:52,575 --> 02:18:54,452
I'm still cheerful.

1294
02:18:56,496 --> 02:18:58,122
I spent the last days of the war

1295
02:18:58,790 --> 02:19:03,336
in an army hospital with friendly nurses,
very friendly nurses.

1296
02:19:03,836 --> 02:19:07,924
Afterwards, fairly quick success
and this professorship here.

1297
02:19:14,389 --> 02:19:15,515
But...

1298
02:19:19,394 --> 02:19:21,771
the grease and the felt...

1299
02:19:22,897 --> 02:19:27,276
those I absorbed
and understood so thoroughly...

1300
02:19:28,319 --> 02:19:31,238
like Descartes understood that he existed.

1301
02:19:31,239 --> 02:19:33,282
"I think, therefore I am."

1302
02:19:36,035 --> 02:19:38,537
He questioned everything. Everything.

1303
02:19:38,538 --> 02:19:42,290
Everything could be an illusion,
a trick, his imagination.

1304
02:19:42,291 --> 02:19:45,503
But then he realized that something
was thinking those thoughts.

1305
02:19:46,212 --> 02:19:48,631
So consequently, something must exist.

1306
02:19:48,965 --> 02:19:50,841
And that something,

1307
02:19:50,842 --> 02:19:52,969
he decided to call "myself."

1308
02:19:56,347 --> 02:19:57,890
But who are you?

1309
02:20:01,477 --> 02:20:02,979
What are you?

1310
02:20:07,859 --> 02:20:08,901
This...

1311
02:20:10,862 --> 02:20:12,030
This is not you.

1312
02:22:24,162 --> 02:22:25,371
How was your day?

1313
02:22:27,206 --> 02:22:28,541
Productive.

1314
02:22:48,853 --> 02:22:50,188
Villa Cimbrone.

1315
02:22:55,693 --> 02:22:58,654
- That's also Villa Cimbrone.
- No, Villa Rufolo.

1316
02:22:58,988 --> 02:23:00,364
But also in Ravello.

1317
02:23:05,411 --> 02:23:06,913
Such a beautiful car!

1318
02:23:12,793 --> 02:23:14,003
Our hotel.

1319
02:23:14,670 --> 02:23:16,005
Le Sirenuse.

1320
02:23:22,595 --> 02:23:24,305
Oh God, Pompeii.

1321
02:23:42,323 --> 02:23:44,283
Still a student at 30?

1322
02:23:46,994 --> 02:23:49,997
When I was 30,
I was senior physician in Dresden.

1323
02:23:50,915 --> 02:23:52,875
When Mozart was 30...

1324
02:23:54,043 --> 02:23:55,336
he was dead.

1325
02:23:59,632 --> 02:24:02,677
I understand you no longer want
my financial support.

1326
02:24:02,927 --> 02:24:04,387
And I find that laudable.

1327
02:24:05,596 --> 02:24:07,181
So I have a suggestion.

1328
02:24:07,807 --> 02:24:10,976
I know the director
of the gynecology clinic in Dusseldorf.

1329
02:24:10,977 --> 02:24:13,688
I'm frequently invited there
for consultations.

1330
02:24:14,188 --> 02:24:18,024
I'll ask him
to give you a part-time job there.

1331
02:24:18,025 --> 02:24:19,402
Something suitable.

1332
02:24:20,653 --> 02:24:23,656
Maybe three hours each morning?

1333
02:24:26,534 --> 02:24:28,327
Then you'll have an income,

1334
02:24:29,078 --> 02:24:32,373
and you'll still have
ample time to... paint.

1335
02:24:41,173 --> 02:24:43,342
Can't he just leave us alone?

1336
02:24:45,553 --> 02:24:47,430
Can't he just vanish from our lives?

1337
02:24:50,224 --> 02:24:52,810
Perhaps the job in the clinic
will help with that.

1338
02:25:16,917 --> 02:25:19,712
DUSSELDORF GYNECOLOGY CLINIC

1339
02:26:24,902 --> 02:26:27,112
White on a white background?

1340
02:26:27,113 --> 02:26:28,280
Is this modern art?

1341
02:26:31,283 --> 02:26:33,828
<i>Allegory of Emptiness.
That</i> could be <i>the title.</i>

1342
02:26:34,620 --> 02:26:36,122
Maybe it will cause a sensation.

1343
02:26:38,541 --> 02:26:42,294
Come on, I'll take you to dinner.
My driver's waiting outside.

1344
02:27:12,450 --> 02:27:15,410
This has to be taken
to the passport office in Bonn

1345
02:27:15,411 --> 02:27:17,955
so they can issue me a permanent document.

1346
02:27:18,539 --> 02:27:21,792
It's ready to be picked up.
Here's your authorization.

1347
02:27:22,960 --> 02:27:27,047
I was thinking, you live close to Bonn.
Why don't you do it for me?

1348
02:27:27,423 --> 02:27:29,758
That way you can earn a bit more money.

1349
02:27:30,301 --> 02:27:34,096
I'll come by next week
to pick up the passport. All right?

1350
02:27:37,016 --> 02:27:39,560
- Can I bring you a coffee, Professor?
- Yes, thank you.

1351
02:27:45,065 --> 02:27:46,817
Burghart Kroll arrested!

1352
02:27:47,109 --> 02:27:50,361
Head of euthanasia program
lived undisturbed for ten years

1353
02:27:50,362 --> 02:27:52,072
as consultant in Schleswig-Holstein.

1354
02:27:55,075 --> 02:27:56,243
Ten cents.

1355
02:27:57,578 --> 02:27:58,746
Thank you.

1356
02:28:00,623 --> 02:28:01,749
Murderer of the sick.

1357
02:28:06,337 --> 02:28:08,005
Murderer of the sick. Ten cents.

1358
02:28:08,923 --> 02:28:11,382
- Thank you, sir. Good-bye.
- Ciao, my boy.

1359
02:28:11,383 --> 02:28:13,385
- Professor, your coffee.
- Thanks.

1360
02:28:39,245 --> 02:28:40,454
You smoke?

1361
02:28:44,583 --> 02:28:47,378
Sixty-three is the right age to start.

1362
02:28:48,420 --> 02:28:50,548
The consequences
will hardly catch up with me.

1363
02:29:02,351 --> 02:29:04,895
You finish your meal.
I'm afraid I have to dash.

1364
02:29:09,650 --> 02:29:10,859
Give my best to Ellie.

1365
02:29:22,079 --> 02:29:24,415
- Good night.
- Good night, Professor.

1366
02:30:19,470 --> 02:30:20,596
May I have a look?

1367
02:30:21,096 --> 02:30:23,474
Keep it. I only need the sports pages.

1368
02:30:23,724 --> 02:30:24,975
Thank you.

1369
02:30:53,212 --> 02:30:54,588
"White On White."

1370
02:30:55,839 --> 02:30:57,341
<i>Allegory of Emptiness.</i>

1371
02:30:58,759 --> 02:31:00,094
Your father-in-law?

1372
02:31:03,972 --> 02:31:05,182
What an asshole.

1373
02:31:07,434 --> 02:31:09,060
You know, for the first time,

1374
02:31:09,061 --> 02:31:11,063
I want success for another
more than for myself.

1375
02:31:12,856 --> 02:31:15,943
Your mistake is clinging
to an easel and canvas.

1376
02:31:17,069 --> 02:31:18,737
Painting is dead.

1377
02:31:19,279 --> 02:31:24,493
Just like folk dancing
and lace-making and silent movies.

1378
02:31:32,543 --> 02:31:35,504
I only want what's best for you,
or I'd just let you carry on.

1379
02:31:38,424 --> 02:31:40,426
It's too late for us
to become doctors now.

1380
02:32:02,114 --> 02:32:06,535
MURDERER OF THE SICK
ARRESTED AFTER 18 YEARS

1381
02:32:35,898 --> 02:32:38,442
MURDERER OF THE SICK

1382
02:40:54,896 --> 02:40:55,939
Kun?

1383
02:41:18,169 --> 02:41:20,046
- Hello.
- Hello.

1384
02:41:24,592 --> 02:41:25,844
What's this?

1385
02:41:26,678 --> 02:41:28,805
I don't know either,
but I think that's it.

1386
02:41:31,099 --> 02:41:32,517
Painted copies of photographs?

1387
02:41:51,077 --> 02:41:52,162
Excuse me.

1388
02:46:33,026 --> 02:46:35,652
Overall,
I am content with the construction.

1389
02:46:35,653 --> 02:46:37,905
That's good to hear, Professor Seeband.

1390
02:46:38,448 --> 02:46:40,783
- I've explained what concerns me.
- Yes.

1391
02:46:44,704 --> 02:46:48,206
The clear door width
to the operating rooms must be

1392
02:46:48,207 --> 02:46:50,043
augmented by 25 centimeters on both sides.

1393
02:46:51,294 --> 02:46:54,588
That way, the larger beds
can still fit through comfortably.

1394
02:46:54,589 --> 02:46:58,051
That's correct.
Thank you for your suggestion, Professor.

1395
02:47:09,729 --> 02:47:12,815
I think you understand
why I didn't introduce you this morning.

1396
02:47:13,316 --> 02:47:15,026
It wouldn't have been appropriate.

1397
02:47:16,653 --> 02:47:19,822
How's the world of art? And,
more importantly, do you have my passport?

1398
02:48:24,762 --> 02:48:25,930
<i>L.</i>

1399
02:48:29,016 --> 02:48:31,436
Unfortunately, I have to go.

1400
02:48:36,315 --> 02:48:37,608
Thanks.

1401
02:48:40,361 --> 02:48:41,404
Excuse me.

1402
02:49:03,009 --> 02:49:04,802
Have you ever seen anything like that?

1403
02:49:06,262 --> 02:49:08,431
What did you say to him?
What's wrong with him?

1404
02:51:18,644 --> 02:51:20,938
If you only knew
how beautiful you look right now.

1405
02:51:22,940 --> 02:51:24,191
I'm pregnant.

1406
02:51:26,736 --> 02:51:27,945
In the fourth month!

1407
02:51:28,779 --> 02:51:31,324
I went to the doctor.
We're going to be parents!

1408
02:51:32,825 --> 02:51:34,702
We're going to be parents after all!

1409
02:52:06,150 --> 02:52:09,236
It's Sunday.
There's nobody here. I promise.

1410
02:52:11,280 --> 02:52:13,282
Please, there's no one here.

1411
02:52:14,951 --> 02:52:16,535
Please, like yesterday.

1412
02:52:17,161 --> 02:52:20,331
Tell me again
and then come down the stairs.

1413
02:52:32,259 --> 02:52:33,636
I'm pregnant.

1414
02:53:18,597 --> 02:53:20,391
It's not potatoes, is it?

1415
02:53:24,353 --> 02:53:26,814
How about I become your gallerist?

1416
02:53:27,732 --> 02:53:29,942
Adrian Schimmel, the gallerist?

1417
02:53:30,985 --> 02:53:32,028
Adrian Finck.

1418
02:54:48,604 --> 02:54:50,022
We should begin.

1419
02:54:53,609 --> 02:54:56,737
Are there any questions for Kurt Barnert?

1420
02:55:00,658 --> 02:55:02,659
Then perhaps I will pose
the first question.

1421
02:55:02,660 --> 02:55:04,244
Mr. Barnert,

1422
02:55:04,245 --> 02:55:08,666
many of your paintings are based
on amateur photographs or magazines.

1423
02:55:09,083 --> 02:55:13,337
<i>But the picture
Nude Descending</i> a <i>Staircase...</i>

1424
02:55:14,463 --> 02:55:17,466
is surely a homage to Duchamp?

1425
02:55:21,679 --> 02:55:22,847
Yes.

1426
02:55:27,643 --> 02:55:29,562
<i>Heinz Viersen, Westdeutsche Zeitung.</i>

1427
02:55:30,020 --> 02:55:33,731
Mr. Barnert, in your magnificent painting
Mother and Child,

1428
02:55:33,732 --> 02:55:36,734
which we see here, who is depicted?

1429
02:55:36,735 --> 02:55:38,028
You and your mother?

1430
02:55:41,490 --> 02:55:44,118
No, it's just an amateur snapshot.

1431
02:55:47,079 --> 02:55:49,039
It doesn't really matter to me
who I paint.

1432
02:55:50,457 --> 02:55:53,752
But if you paint a portrait,
you must know the person.

1433
02:55:54,587 --> 02:55:56,672
It's actually better if I don't know them.

1434
02:55:58,048 --> 02:55:59,884
Then I see better what's really there.

1435
02:56:02,678 --> 02:56:05,931
Is that the reason behind the passport
photos from a photo booth?

1436
02:56:06,557 --> 02:56:08,392
A photograph without an author?

1437
02:56:11,020 --> 02:56:12,062
Yes.

1438
02:56:12,730 --> 02:56:14,814
So by painting a Wehrmacht officer,

1439
02:56:14,815 --> 02:56:16,984
you aren't making a statement
about the Wehrmacht?

1440
02:56:17,568 --> 02:56:21,447
No, I don't make statements.
I make pictures.

1441
02:56:22,156 --> 02:56:24,992
Photographs... Photographs by other means.

1442
02:56:25,910 --> 02:56:27,703
Hermann Schreiber, SDR.

1443
02:56:28,495 --> 02:56:31,916
You take the exact composition
from a snapshot.

1444
02:56:32,625 --> 02:56:34,627
Surely that means everything is random.

1445
02:56:36,170 --> 02:56:37,755
Not random.

1446
02:56:39,632 --> 02:56:42,009
Real. Coherent. Consistent.

1447
02:56:43,719 --> 02:56:45,553
Only reality is consistent.

1448
02:56:45,554 --> 02:56:47,556
Every reality is consistent.

1449
02:56:49,725 --> 02:56:51,602
Everything that's true is beautiful.

1450
02:56:52,603 --> 02:56:54,021
What do you mean by that?

1451
02:57:00,361 --> 02:57:02,404
Let's suppose I say six numbers
to you now.

1452
02:57:03,113 --> 02:57:05,616
It's just stupid. Pointless.

1453
02:57:05,991 --> 02:57:10,913
But if the six numbers are the winning
lottery numbers, then they mean something.

1454
02:57:11,330 --> 02:57:14,375
They have consistency,
value, almost beauty.

1455
02:57:15,084 --> 02:57:17,002
It's the same with the photographs.

1456
02:57:17,878 --> 02:57:19,296
I want the truth.

1457
02:57:38,399 --> 02:57:39,900
Yes, Mr. Meybert?

1458
02:57:40,651 --> 02:57:42,945
<i>Urs Meybert, Kunstchronik.</i>

1459
02:57:43,779 --> 02:57:47,241
What will be next for you? More painted,
blurry copies of photographs?

1460
02:57:48,325 --> 02:57:50,661
No, I've had enough of them for a while.

1461
02:57:51,370 --> 02:57:53,664
I'm more interested in color charts now.

1462
02:57:54,373 --> 02:57:55,624
Color charts?

1463
02:57:56,166 --> 02:57:57,293
Yes.

1464
02:58:01,547 --> 02:58:02,965
That'll get us into trouble.

1465
02:58:07,303 --> 02:58:08,929
That'll get us into trouble too.

1466
02:58:16,061 --> 02:58:20,231
Magazine images chosen at random,
photo booth passport photos,

1467
02:58:20,232 --> 02:58:22,817
snapshots from family albums.

1468
02:58:22,818 --> 02:58:25,112
All reproduced in painting, but blurred.

1469
02:58:25,946 --> 02:58:30,701
With these pictures, which have
genuine force in some mysterious way,

1470
02:58:31,118 --> 02:58:36,039
Kurt Barnert seems to be developing
into the leading artist of his generation.

1471
02:58:36,040 --> 02:58:39,000
And that while working in a medium
that is often considered dead. Painting.

1472
02:58:39,501 --> 02:58:40,627
But,

1473
02:58:41,295 --> 02:58:45,758
like many of his generation,
he has no stories to tell, nothing to say.

1474
02:58:46,091 --> 02:58:48,092
He parts with artistic tradition,

1475
02:58:48,093 --> 02:58:51,512
breaks with
an autobiographical approach to art.

1476
02:58:51,513 --> 02:58:54,974
So for the first time
in the history of art,

1477
02:58:54,975 --> 02:58:57,478
we can speak of a work without an author.

1478
02:58:58,771 --> 02:58:59,772
Was that good?

1479
02:59:00,522 --> 02:59:01,523
Great.

1480
02:59:14,203 --> 02:59:16,080
Sure I can't drive you to your hotel?

1481
02:59:16,872 --> 02:59:18,540
I'd like to walk a bit.

1482
02:59:21,126 --> 02:59:22,461
You were good today.

1483
02:59:23,295 --> 02:59:24,338
It was good.

1484
02:59:25,839 --> 02:59:26,924
It's going to be good.
