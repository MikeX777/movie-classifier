4
00:05:29,327 --> 00:05:30,429
What'd we do last night?

5
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,165
Lot of trick-or-treaters?

6
00:05:37,101 --> 00:05:38,170
Any candy left?

7
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:41,941
Business was good.

8
00:05:42,274 --> 00:05:43,742
You give out one a piece
like I told you?

9
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:46,879
What does that mean?

10
00:05:47,713 --> 00:05:49,047
Come on, Victor,
you got your hearing aid in.

11
00:05:49,514 --> 00:05:51,584
- What happened?
- They took it all, Jimmy.

12
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,351
They... they took it all?
Who took it all?

13
00:05:53,851 --> 00:05:55,320
- Aladdin.
- Aladdin?

14
00:05:56,454 --> 00:05:57,389
One kid?

15
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,059
You let one kid
take all the candy?

16
00:06:00,992 --> 00:06:02,360
I thought you were gonna
sit outside with it.

17
00:06:02,694 --> 00:06:04,530
Well, I pu... I put on
the dummy's clothes,

18
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:07,633
because I wanted to make
believe I was the dummy.

19
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,269
I wanted to scare 'em, but then,

20
00:06:10,668 --> 00:06:13,705
they all rolled up on me
at once and I got scared.

21
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,908
Got scared to scare them.

22
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:17,908
Mugged by a bunch
of little shits with

23
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,912
- pillow cases.
- Aladdin.

24
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:21,680
Eh, listen, shake it off.

25
00:06:22,713 --> 00:06:23,714
Fuck those kids.

26
00:06:24,048 --> 00:06:25,317
Next year,
I'm getting 'em apples.

27
00:06:29,654 --> 00:06:31,187
- Hey Jimmy.
- Morning.

28
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:32,591
- Hey, Jimmy.
- How you doing?

29
00:06:33,024 --> 00:06:34,394
You didn't come home last night.

30
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:38,030
I was doing inventory.
I was here all night.

31
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:41,701
- Hey.
- Hey.

32
00:06:43,869 --> 00:06:45,437
Besides, you're okay
by yourself, right?

33
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:47,103
You didn't have any problems.

34
00:06:47,105 --> 00:06:48,505
Outside the thing
with the goddamn candy,

35
00:06:48,507 --> 00:06:49,741
you did all right
by yourself, right?

36
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:52,576
How's it going, Vic?

37
00:06:52,778 --> 00:06:53,812
What's the frequency
down here, buddy?

38
00:06:54,245 --> 00:06:55,745
Hey, did you guys hear
they're shooting a big old movie

39
00:06:55,747 --> 00:06:56,947
down there in the park?

40
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,048
Yeah, we heard.

41
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,117
Vic's all excited,

42
00:06:59,384 --> 00:07:00,716
he's gonna head
over there tonight, right Vic?

43
00:07:00,718 --> 00:07:02,053
Yeah,
it's a John Travolta movie,

44
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:03,756
but he's not gonna be there.

45
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:05,257
He's in Hollywood.

46
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,522
Hey, you know, Vic,
You ought to take

47
00:07:06,524 --> 00:07:07,425
your fiddle down there.

48
00:07:08,093 --> 00:07:09,425
You never know, they might give
you a big part or something.

49
00:07:09,427 --> 00:07:10,394
He's right on that one, Victor.

50
00:07:10,762 --> 00:07:12,695
You ever notice
they're always hiring somebody

51
00:07:12,697 --> 00:07:14,096
to do something
in the background.

52
00:07:14,098 --> 00:07:16,533
It's not a fiddle, Donnie,
it's a violin.

53
00:07:16,535 --> 00:07:17,703
Whatever, same thing.

54
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:19,271
It's not like we've ever
seen you play the damn thing.

55
00:07:19,437 --> 00:07:20,938
All right, leave him alone.

56
00:07:21,807 --> 00:07:24,039
He's had a rough night.
They took all his candy.

57
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,110
They took his candy?

58
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,112
- Who?
- Aladdin, that's who.

59
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:05,318
Excuse me.

60
00:08:29,908 --> 00:08:32,475
Geez, Pat, are you okay?

61
00:08:34,913 --> 00:08:37,883
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

62
00:08:38,283 --> 00:08:39,518
Fucking druggy maniac.

63
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,089
Look at me.

64
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:48,360
Let's get you cleaned up.

65
00:08:48,827 --> 00:08:50,196
Just go, go outside, go have
a cigarette or something.

66
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:52,430
All right.

67
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:56,168
<i>Oak.</i>

68
00:08:56,701 --> 00:08:57,702
<i>Patti.</i>

69
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,172
Are you all right?

70
00:09:03,341 --> 00:09:04,476
Somebody gonna look at you?

71
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:07,245
Yeah.

72
00:09:12,717 --> 00:09:13,885
Call me if you need anything.

73
00:09:14,653 --> 00:09:16,721
Yeah. All right.
I'll talk to you later.

74
00:09:55,793 --> 00:09:56,962
- Hey, Leo.
- No.

75
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,065
What was I gonna say?

76
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:02,634
Am I getting any more
fucking new Hank Snow records?

77
00:10:02,934 --> 00:10:04,600
- Yeah.
- He's been dead,

78
00:10:04,602 --> 00:10:05,935
um, 20 years now,

79
00:10:05,937 --> 00:10:08,771
so he ain't gonna be
making any new albums.

80
00:10:08,773 --> 00:10:10,006
I know he's dead.

81
00:10:10,008 --> 00:10:12,208
So, stop asking me,
you chucklehead.

82
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,379
You give me no joy, Leo.

83
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:17,082
They're filming a movie here,
you know.

84
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,484
- Who's they?
- They.

85
00:10:20,085 --> 00:10:21,119
Never heard of 'em.

86
00:10:21,385 --> 00:10:22,988
I might go over there tonight
and watch.

87
00:10:23,955 --> 00:10:24,956
You never know.

88
00:10:28,126 --> 00:10:30,161
- See ya' later, Leo.
- Okay, Vic.

89
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:01,386
- Long day?
- Long day.

90
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,694
You all right?

91
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:12,865
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- Yeah?

92
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:16,368
Where's Freddy?

93
00:12:18,136 --> 00:12:19,070
Getting ready for work.

94
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,441
He was home all day?

95
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,275
Yeah.

96
00:12:25,543 --> 00:12:26,745
Didn't wanna wake him.

97
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:28,913
Why you ask?

98
00:12:29,914 --> 00:12:31,216
Don't know, just asking.

99
00:12:44,461 --> 00:12:46,899
Oh, look at fucking Victor, man.

100
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:50,233
Ta-doo, ta-doo, ta-doo.

101
00:13:29,107 --> 00:13:31,741
Yo, he thinks it's a real
phone booth.

102
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,643
Moron.

103
00:13:35,913 --> 00:13:37,081
We should do something.

104
00:13:39,317 --> 00:13:41,153
Yo, let's flip it!

105
00:13:58,136 --> 00:14:00,371
Jimmy, you need to get down
to Broad Street.

106
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,374
- Why, what's up?
- It's, uh, your brother Vic.

107
00:14:07,511 --> 00:14:09,280
- Hey!
- Oh, oh, oh.

108
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,948
- Hey, what happened?
- Wait, who are you?

109
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:12,982
- I'm his brother.
- Jimmy?

110
00:14:12,984 --> 00:14:14,416
- Jimmy!
- What the fuck happened?

111
00:14:14,418 --> 00:14:16,252
We heard a crash
and this is what we found.

112
00:14:16,254 --> 00:14:17,554
Jimmy, get me outta here!

113
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:18,988
Victor, we're gonna get you out.
You gotta relax.

114
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,156
- I'm stuck, Jimmy, I'm stuck!
- Okay, relax, breathe.

115
00:14:21,158 --> 00:14:22,258
- Just breathe.
- Okay.

116
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,526
- I'm here.
- Jimmy!

117
00:14:23,528 --> 00:14:24,594
Okay, I'm here now.

118
00:14:24,596 --> 00:14:25,494
Jimmy, get me...

119
00:14:26,664 --> 00:14:27,729
What's wrong?

120
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:28,899
Victor, what's wrong?

121
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:30,368
What's wrong?

122
00:14:30,634 --> 00:14:32,801
Oh, my hearing aid,
Jimmy, my hearing aid!

123
00:14:32,803 --> 00:14:34,170
Take the hearing aid out,
Victor.

124
00:14:34,172 --> 00:14:36,705
I can't reach it,
Jimmy, I'm stuck!

125
00:14:36,707 --> 00:14:38,273
- Okay, relax...
- Jimmy, Jimmy!

126
00:14:40,745 --> 00:14:41,779
Cover your face!

127
00:14:42,312 --> 00:14:43,512
Fuck!

128
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,620
Is he all right?

129
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:50,088
You okay?

130
00:14:51,823 --> 00:14:53,956
It's okay, it's okay,
you all right?

131
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,926
You okay?

132
00:15:12,076 --> 00:15:13,477
Hey, knock it off.

133
00:15:14,178 --> 00:15:15,213
What do I always tell you?

134
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,115
- Chuck it.
- What?

135
00:15:18,383 --> 00:15:20,653
Chuck it in the fuck-it bucket
and move on.

136
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:23,987
But what else do I tell you?

137
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:25,220
What did Grandma
used to tell us, huh?

138
00:15:25,222 --> 00:15:26,390
You can't what?

139
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,661
You can't unring a bell,
right, hmm?

140
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:32,661
Maybe if you didn't lose
or break

141
00:15:32,663 --> 00:15:34,497
every fucking cell phone
that I buy for you,

142
00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:35,931
then none of this
would've happened.

143
00:15:35,933 --> 00:15:38,635
I wasn't calling anybody Jimmy.
I was just playing.

144
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:40,371
Come on, let's just drop it.

145
00:15:41,105 --> 00:15:42,539
Besides,
what'd the guy say, right?

146
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:43,608
They come back to town...

147
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,708
they'll let you,
put you in the movie.

148
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,344
They'll let you stand on
a corner or something.

149
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:48,547
They're not coming back.

150
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:49,980
How do you know that?

151
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,683
They went back to Hollywood.

152
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:58,624
Do me a favor.

153
00:15:59,624 --> 00:16:00,926
Don't go disappearing today.

154
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:02,994
You come straight back
from the bank, right?

155
00:16:03,528 --> 00:16:05,931
Need you to clean out
all the taps and move the kegs.

156
00:16:07,131 --> 00:16:08,666
Eat your eggs,
they're gonna be like ice.

157
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,441
I know, Gram.

158
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,974
Every day,
I'm getting a little sick

159
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:19,510
of running this place
all by myself.

160
00:16:20,077 --> 00:16:22,280
You, me, Cheryl, it's not easy.

161
00:16:23,847 --> 00:16:24,946
By yourself?

162
00:16:24,948 --> 00:16:25,949
You goddamn right.

163
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:27,782
You, Cheryl, and Grandma?

164
00:16:27,784 --> 00:16:28,820
You goddamn right.

165
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:31,456
That don't make
no sense, Jimmy.

166
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,091
Oh, yeah?
You feelin' better now?

167
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:36,128
- Huh?
- You're goddamn right.

168
00:16:36,794 --> 00:16:37,795
Excuse me?

169
00:16:38,096 --> 00:16:39,130
You being a wise ass?

170
00:16:39,697 --> 00:16:42,431
- What?
- Don't what, stop it.

171
00:16:42,433 --> 00:16:44,336
Hello.

172
00:16:48,005 --> 00:16:49,140
You open?

173
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:51,643
Yeah, we're open.

174
00:16:54,479 --> 00:16:55,480
Hello.

175
00:16:58,149 --> 00:16:59,149
Can I use your girl's room?

176
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,485
Go ahead.

177
00:17:06,657 --> 00:17:08,159
Yeah, you're feeling
much better, huh?

178
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:15,601
- Morning.
- Morning.

179
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,202
How you doing, Jimmy?

180
00:17:20,538 --> 00:17:22,205
Hey there, Vic,
what's the frequency, buddy?

181
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,076
- Just shut up, all right?
- What?

182
00:17:27,144 --> 00:17:28,745
Uh, Bell Atlantic,
we have a problem.

183
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:30,046
Didn't I just ask you

184
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:31,149
to shut the fuck up,

185
00:17:31,382 --> 00:17:32,381
- and leave him alone?
- Come on Jimmy,

186
00:17:32,383 --> 00:17:33,485
I'm just kidding.

187
00:17:33,684 --> 00:17:35,218
He's just bustin' with him,
Jimmy, come on.

188
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,754
Well, sometimes he doesn't know
when to shut the fuck up.

189
00:17:36,988 --> 00:17:38,353
Aw, Vic, I'm sorry, man.

190
00:17:38,355 --> 00:17:39,656
You know I'm just messing
with you, right?

191
00:17:40,023 --> 00:17:41,525
You give me no joy, Donnie.

192
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,528
That's it, Vic,
you tell him.

193
00:17:47,865 --> 00:17:48,732
Seriously, Jimmy?

194
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:50,501
Nine in the morning with that?

195
00:17:50,902 --> 00:17:52,634
- What?
- It smells like weed,

196
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:54,671
like somebody lit
a big bone up in here.

197
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:56,240
- Excuse me?
- You smell that, Phil?

198
00:17:57,741 --> 00:17:58,710
I do.

199
00:18:09,887 --> 00:18:10,920
Hey.

200
00:18:10,922 --> 00:18:12,124
<i>Yo, I'll be right out.</i>

201
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:16,294
You all right in there?

202
00:18:18,762 --> 00:18:19,730
Yep.

203
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,269
You know this girl?

204
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:36,048
Hey, do me a favor,
not in here with that, okay?

205
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,350
I don't know what
you're talking about, but...

206
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:40,219
thank you for your kindness.

207
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,188
See ya', boys.

208
00:19:04,142 --> 00:19:05,443
Hi, Victor!

209
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,178
- Oh hi, Judy.
- What happened last night?

210
00:19:08,445 --> 00:19:09,580
Heard you had an accident?

211
00:19:09,913 --> 00:19:10,847
I got pushed.

212
00:19:11,115 --> 00:19:12,150
You got pushed?

213
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:13,652
It's a long story.

214
00:19:14,185 --> 00:19:15,750
Oh, don't be upset.

215
00:19:15,752 --> 00:19:17,020
I won't bother you about it.

216
00:19:17,821 --> 00:19:19,724
When are you gonna play
your violin for us?

217
00:19:20,991 --> 00:19:22,123
I wanna hear it!

218
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,461
Yeah, someday.

219
00:20:56,721 --> 00:20:58,656
Hey, you wanna see
something funny?

220
00:20:59,156 --> 00:21:00,125
Read this.

221
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:17,909
If something really big
and scary...

222
00:21:22,446 --> 00:21:24,348
and ugly and hairy...

223
00:21:25,116 --> 00:21:27,418
is following you around
this Halloween,

224
00:21:27,685 --> 00:21:28,720
don't be frightened.

225
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,424
It's just your fat ass!

226
00:21:37,295 --> 00:21:38,596
Hey, are you following me?

227
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,500
Not that you're big
and hairy and scary.

228
00:21:45,569 --> 00:21:47,338
It's okay. I don't care.

229
00:21:48,138 --> 00:21:49,373
You're not gonna hurt me, right?

230
00:21:50,407 --> 00:21:51,842
No. No, no.

231
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,378
No.

232
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:55,380
Are you okay?

233
00:21:55,946 --> 00:21:57,581
I saw what they did
to you last night.

234
00:21:57,882 --> 00:21:59,584
That was just downright
kinda fucked up.

235
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:03,154
They were filming
a John Travolta movie...

236
00:22:04,221 --> 00:22:05,289
but he wasn't there.

237
00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:07,823
Jimmy said they might come back,

238
00:22:07,825 --> 00:22:09,461
but they went back to Hollywood.

239
00:22:11,261 --> 00:22:12,163
So, what's your name?

240
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,698
Victor.

241
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:15,296
Why are you
following me, Victor?

242
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:16,835
Are you looking for a friend
to hang with?

243
00:22:18,569 --> 00:22:20,102
You don't look like
the kind of person

244
00:22:20,104 --> 00:22:21,405
people should be so mean to.

245
00:22:22,606 --> 00:22:25,309
I'll be your friend, if that
is what you're looking for?

246
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,518
You're very pretty.

247
00:22:35,086 --> 00:22:36,054
I am?

248
00:22:36,453 --> 00:22:37,321
Oh.

249
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:39,391
Well thank you, Victor.

250
00:22:45,796 --> 00:22:46,798
You're blushing.

251
00:22:50,267 --> 00:22:52,737
I'll... I'll have to remember
this one for next year.

252
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:55,540
I got plenty of people
I can send that to.

253
00:22:56,673 --> 00:22:58,009
It's just your fat ass!

254
00:23:07,751 --> 00:23:09,052
<i>What you got there?</i>

255
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,889
Oh, that's my violin.

256
00:23:11,856 --> 00:23:13,191
Are you going for a lesson?

257
00:23:14,692 --> 00:23:15,727
Um, no.

258
00:23:16,827 --> 00:23:18,028
Are you gonna
play it somewhere?

259
00:23:19,797 --> 00:23:20,999
No.

260
00:23:21,965 --> 00:23:23,601
You just like carrying
it around with you then.

261
00:23:25,869 --> 00:23:27,204
Yeah, I guess.

262
00:23:28,272 --> 00:23:30,074
Something special
you like to have with you.

263
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:31,710
I get it.

264
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:37,115
Say, what's your name again?

265
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,552
I don't know,
what do you want it to be?

266
00:23:47,057 --> 00:23:48,058
I don't know.

267
00:23:55,366 --> 00:23:57,032
Maybe when I meet
someone new that I like,

268
00:23:57,034 --> 00:23:58,503
I like them to pick out
a name for me...

269
00:23:59,636 --> 00:24:00,638
and that way...

270
00:24:02,773 --> 00:24:05,476
if it's a name they already like
then they already like me.

271
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:12,748
It's all right, you don't have
to pick out one now.

272
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,751
You can do it later.

273
00:24:15,118 --> 00:24:16,153
Okay.

274
00:24:16,954 --> 00:24:18,220
Hey, say Victor,
you wouldn't happen to have

275
00:24:18,222 --> 00:24:19,289
a smoke on you, would you?

276
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:20,592
Oh!

277
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:23,662
No, I... I don't smoke,
Jimmy smokes.

278
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,262
Who's Jimmy?

279
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:28,298
Jimmy's my little brother.

280
00:24:28,898 --> 00:24:30,500
He's the one
that yelled at you at The Oak.

281
00:24:30,835 --> 00:24:32,937
That's our tavern, we own it.

282
00:24:33,704 --> 00:24:35,472
- Oh, you don't say?
- Yeah.

283
00:24:36,207 --> 00:24:38,443
It used to be
my dad's a long time ago...

284
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:41,378
but me and Jimmy,
we work there together.

285
00:24:41,945 --> 00:24:43,981
Actually Victor,
I wouldn't say he yelled at me.

286
00:24:44,915 --> 00:24:47,051
He actually seems like
a nice man, your little bro.

287
00:24:49,953 --> 00:24:51,589
I've never seen you before.

288
00:24:52,656 --> 00:24:53,790
What street you from?

289
00:24:54,424 --> 00:24:55,626
I'm not from around here.

290
00:24:56,426 --> 00:24:57,862
I'm from all over the place.

291
00:24:59,096 --> 00:24:59,963
I usually just bus it,

292
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:01,730
and then when I see somewhere
I might like to stay

293
00:25:01,732 --> 00:25:02,834
for a while,
that's where I get off.

294
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:06,169
Why'd you come off
a bus here in Bloomfield?

295
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,172
I don't know.

296
00:25:08,272 --> 00:25:09,773
I dig the way
this part looked...

297
00:25:10,106 --> 00:25:13,209
like it wasn't anything special
but it wasn't too bad either.

298
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:15,012
Well, where do you sleep?

299
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,881
Well, last night for instance,
I slept on that park bench

300
00:25:18,883 --> 00:25:20,018
under that pretty tree.

301
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:28,058
But you don't have any mattress
or any pillow.

302
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,362
No, I don't need none.

303
00:25:30,828 --> 00:25:33,764
I got a blanky in my knapsack,
a change of clothes, a book...

304
00:25:34,365 --> 00:25:35,698
and when I woke up this morning

305
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,802
I was covered
in beautiful yellow leaves.

306
00:25:39,936 --> 00:25:40,871
What?

307
00:25:46,176 --> 00:25:47,211
Huh?

308
00:25:47,912 --> 00:25:49,077
You're weird.

309
00:25:50,381 --> 00:25:51,349
Yeah.

310
00:25:52,516 --> 00:25:53,685
That's right, Victor.

311
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,220
And you wanna know what?

312
00:25:56,854 --> 00:25:58,890
You're pretty weird
yourself, aren't you?

313
00:26:00,924 --> 00:26:01,926
I guess.

314
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:06,995
Don't let anybody tell you
that's a bad thing,

315
00:26:06,997 --> 00:26:08,033
'cause it's not.

316
00:26:08,731 --> 00:26:09,834
It's a good thing.

317
00:26:11,035 --> 00:26:12,366
It's not?

318
00:26:12,368 --> 00:26:14,105
Only the mediocre are
always at their best...

319
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:17,542
and I can tell already,
that ain't us.

320
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:05,690
<i>Vic!</i>

321
00:27:07,224 --> 00:27:08,259
<i>Victor!</i>

322
00:27:11,028 --> 00:27:13,064
Hey, where the hell
were you today?

323
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:14,999
Didn't I ask you
not to disappear?

324
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,933
I needed your help today?

325
00:27:17,233 --> 00:27:18,433
I was here.

326
00:27:18,435 --> 00:27:20,102
No, no you weren't here.

327
00:27:20,104 --> 00:27:21,770
I called the house six times!

328
00:27:21,772 --> 00:27:24,975
I got a fucking hernia moving
kegs around all day by myself.

329
00:27:25,476 --> 00:27:26,645
I guess I forgot.

330
00:27:26,877 --> 00:27:29,012
Don't give me you forgot,
because that's bullshit.

331
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,613
Get it outta your head that
I'm just gonna keep taking care

332
00:27:31,615 --> 00:27:33,451
of you for the rest
of your life, because I'm not.

333
00:27:33,751 --> 00:27:35,449
Learn to pull your
own goddamn weight,

334
00:27:35,451 --> 00:27:37,585
and will you turn this shit off
for Christ's sakes?

335
00:27:37,587 --> 00:27:38,854
Hey!

336
00:27:38,856 --> 00:27:40,055
Can't you listen
to something else?

337
00:27:40,057 --> 00:27:41,256
That's all I ever hear.

338
00:27:41,258 --> 00:27:42,790
Hank Snow, Hank Snow!

339
00:27:42,792 --> 00:27:44,594
Who the hell listens
to Hank Snow anyway, you,

340
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:46,895
- that's who!
- Hank Snow is a legend.

341
00:27:46,897 --> 00:27:48,165
That's Songs of Tragedy.

342
00:27:48,499 --> 00:27:51,201
Oh gee, Songs of Tragedy,
how uplifting.

343
00:27:51,501 --> 00:27:53,669
He's got a fucking
noose on his album cover!

344
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:55,338
It's dreary, hillbilly shit.

345
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:57,375
And since when do you
not make your bed?

346
00:27:58,008 --> 00:27:59,044
You're an adult.

347
00:27:59,777 --> 00:28:00,979
You have responsibility.

348
00:28:03,881 --> 00:28:06,184
Sorry, I didn't do it
on purpose.

349
00:28:08,885 --> 00:28:09,854
All right.

350
00:28:10,354 --> 00:28:12,520
Just finish up whatever this is,

351
00:28:12,522 --> 00:28:14,125
and then help me
downstairs with dinner.

352
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:15,493
I'm going out tonight.

353
00:28:43,787 --> 00:28:44,822
Hey, Jimmy.

354
00:28:45,489 --> 00:28:47,692
You didn't really get
a hernia today, did you?

355
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:50,360
No...

356
00:28:51,561 --> 00:28:52,529
but I could've.

357
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:56,333
'Cause I was gonna say,
if you really did get a hernia,

358
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,603
I'm sure Patti could
take care of you.

359
00:28:59,202 --> 00:29:00,237
Patti?

360
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:02,040
What the hell does that mean?

361
00:29:02,673 --> 00:29:03,708
Who told you that?

362
00:29:04,808 --> 00:29:06,810
Listen,
you don't go saying shit,

363
00:29:07,411 --> 00:29:09,279
making up stories,
you understand?

364
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,115
Her and I are good friends,
that's it.

365
00:29:11,515 --> 00:29:12,680
Yeah, but...

366
00:29:12,682 --> 00:29:13,785
No, no, no but.

367
00:29:15,486 --> 00:29:17,054
God forbid somebody hears you,

368
00:29:17,755 --> 00:29:19,023
and get the wrong impression.

369
00:29:19,923 --> 00:29:21,225
I can get in a lot of trouble.

370
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:24,261
Patti, she's a married woman.

371
00:29:24,795 --> 00:29:26,128
You understand?

372
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,132
Yeah, Jimmy.

373
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:32,971
But alls I was saying
is that Patti's a nurse.

374
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:35,373
She could help you.

375
00:29:37,441 --> 00:29:38,476
Oh.

376
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,250
<i>Where you going big boy?</i>

377
00:29:49,686 --> 00:29:50,786
Hey!

378
00:29:50,788 --> 00:29:51,890
Where you going?

379
00:29:52,355 --> 00:29:53,423
Hey!

380
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,891
Don't come near me!
I'll fuckin' jump!

381
00:29:55,893 --> 00:29:57,191
If I could only be so lucky.

382
00:29:57,193 --> 00:29:58,930
One less scumbag off
the fucking streets.

383
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:05,901
Come here.

384
00:30:05,903 --> 00:30:07,035
You dumb motherfucker,

385
00:30:07,037 --> 00:30:08,103
you should've jumped.

386
00:30:08,105 --> 00:30:09,206
Do not fuck with me!

387
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,738
I'll push you!

388
00:30:11,842 --> 00:30:13,109
Cuff him!

389
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:14,612
I want a lawyer.

390
00:30:17,914 --> 00:30:19,116
- More tea?
- Hmm.

391
00:30:24,188 --> 00:30:25,723
There you go. Thanks.

392
00:30:30,827 --> 00:30:31,930
Hey, handsome.

393
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:34,231
How ya doin'?

394
00:30:34,531 --> 00:30:36,297
You're late tonight,
baby, are you okay?

395
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:37,401
Yeah, I'm fine.

396
00:30:37,768 --> 00:30:39,367
Guy steals a car in Belleville
and had to chase him

397
00:30:39,369 --> 00:30:40,635
all the way to Franklin.

398
00:30:40,637 --> 00:30:41,937
Can't fucking run
like I used to, Roberta,

399
00:30:41,939 --> 00:30:43,675
I'm telling ya'. Smoked.

400
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,708
Franklin, they just paved that.

401
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:46,975
Must be nice, right?

402
00:30:46,977 --> 00:30:47,979
Yeah, it's beautiful.

403
00:30:50,147 --> 00:30:51,680
- Where's your partner?
- Jerking off.

404
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:55,651
Come on, it's freezing.

405
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:57,353
Yeah, I know,
bad guys are still out there.

406
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,489
- Um,
- Yeah?

407
00:30:58,689 --> 00:31:01,258
When I get off at one,
I could use a ride home.

408
00:31:02,292 --> 00:31:03,960
All right, I'll see
what I can do, all right?

409
00:32:40,624 --> 00:32:42,226
Un-fuckin-believable!

410
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:43,626
Awesome.

411
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:45,028
And what's with you?

412
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:47,496
- Huh?
- What?

413
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:48,865
I thought you said
you didn't know her.

414
00:32:51,268 --> 00:32:52,634
I've seen her around.

415
00:32:52,636 --> 00:32:53,804
Oh, you seen her around?

416
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:55,336
Is that how all the uh,

417
00:32:55,338 --> 00:32:56,673
the "hello Victor"
business happened?

418
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,240
Look at you,
got your nice shirt on,

419
00:32:59,242 --> 00:33:00,642
you smell like a barbershop.

420
00:33:00,644 --> 00:33:02,678
Starting to think,
maybe Vic's got a girlfriend

421
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,844
he's been keeping from us.

422
00:33:03,846 --> 00:33:04,848
What?

423
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:09,420
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Yeah?

424
00:33:10,554 --> 00:33:11,786
Didn't I just talk to you
yesterday,

425
00:33:11,788 --> 00:33:13,290
about doing that shit
in my bathroom?

426
00:33:13,824 --> 00:33:14,826
Doing what?

427
00:33:16,326 --> 00:33:17,461
What you were doing.

428
00:33:19,296 --> 00:33:20,264
Peeing?

429
00:33:20,797 --> 00:33:22,165
No, not peeing!

430
00:33:22,365 --> 00:33:24,665
You know what I'm talking about!
Smoking weed in my bathroom!

431
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:25,734
I wasn't smoking weed.

432
00:33:25,736 --> 00:33:26,834
- Yes, you were...
- No, I wasn't.

433
00:33:26,836 --> 00:33:28,004
- Yes, you were...
- No, I wasn't!

434
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,105
Do you think
I'm a fucking idiot?

435
00:33:29,506 --> 00:33:30,874
Honestly, you think I'm stupid?

436
00:33:31,307 --> 00:33:33,808
We all imagined the smell
of marijuana billowing out

437
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:36,311
of the bathroom door,
not two feet away from the bar?

438
00:33:36,313 --> 00:33:37,582
Is that
what you're gonna tell me?

439
00:33:38,415 --> 00:33:39,384
Huh?

440
00:33:41,484 --> 00:33:42,552
I'm sorry.

441
00:33:43,819 --> 00:33:44,788
I'm really sorry.

442
00:33:45,021 --> 00:33:46,155
Just do me a favor.

443
00:33:46,957 --> 00:33:49,192
If you're gonna
smoke that stuff,

444
00:33:49,459 --> 00:33:50,992
smoke outside, not in here.

445
00:33:50,994 --> 00:33:52,026
- I got it.
- Yeah?

446
00:33:52,028 --> 00:33:52,997
- Yeah.
- You're clear?

447
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:54,298
Clear.

448
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:57,468
Can I go now?

449
00:33:57,768 --> 00:33:59,303
I'm not the principal, go.

450
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:04,805
What am I running
an opium den?

451
00:34:04,807 --> 00:34:06,007
You gotta point, Jimmy.

452
00:34:06,009 --> 00:34:07,278
Cops come in here
and smell that,

453
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,811
you're the one
that's gonna be in trouble.

454
00:34:09,045 --> 00:34:10,246
<i>Yeah, no shit.</i>

455
00:34:10,746 --> 00:34:12,347
<i>Her prancing in here, doing
whatever the hell she wants</i>

456
00:34:12,349 --> 00:34:13,384
<i>like she owns the place.</i>

457
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:15,816
I wanna know
how this girl knows Vic.

458
00:34:15,818 --> 00:34:16,920
That's a good question, Victor.

459
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,252
Hiya, Leo.

460
00:34:49,085 --> 00:34:50,052
Hello.

461
00:34:50,454 --> 00:34:51,389
Leo, this is my friend.

462
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:54,492
This is Leo, it's his store.

463
00:34:59,762 --> 00:35:00,896
Hey, Leo?

464
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:02,467
You get any new Hank Snow in?

465
00:35:03,233 --> 00:35:06,036
Um no, Vic, I... I don't.

466
00:35:06,335 --> 00:35:07,370
Okay.

467
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:09,438
When do you think, maybe soon?

468
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,375
You'll be the first
to know, Vic.

469
00:35:11,708 --> 00:35:13,877
You give me no joy, Leo.

470
00:35:14,577 --> 00:35:15,646
Who's Hank Snow?

471
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:18,149
Hank Snow?

472
00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:20,585
He's The Singing Ranger.

473
00:35:21,985 --> 00:35:23,385
He's a legend.

474
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:25,522
He was the longest-running
artist on any label.

475
00:35:25,789 --> 00:35:27,991
He was on RCA for 50 years!

476
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:31,258
He recorded over a hundred
and forty albums.

477
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,663
I only have a few
of them though.

478
00:35:34,231 --> 00:35:35,600
They're hard to get on vinyl.

479
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:42,440
Ah, this one...
this one's one of my favorites.

480
00:35:43,139 --> 00:35:44,340
I might get it again.

481
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:47,911
He's had a song on the charts
for five decades in a row.

482
00:35:48,945 --> 00:35:51,746
In 1949, he met Ernie Tubb

483
00:35:51,748 --> 00:35:54,782
and Ernie Tubb got him
into the Grand Ole Opry.

484
00:35:54,784 --> 00:35:55,819
Cool.

485
00:35:57,355 --> 00:35:59,420
- "Confused With the Blues."
- Oh,

486
00:35:59,422 --> 00:36:01,657
"I'm Moving On,"
was number one on the charts

487
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,025
for 29 weeks.

488
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:04,492
It's his signature song.

489
00:36:04,494 --> 00:36:07,729
Altogether, he had 85 singles
on the charts,

490
00:36:07,731 --> 00:36:09,634
and sold over 90 million albums.

491
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:11,833
Fuck!

492
00:36:11,835 --> 00:36:14,005
You know everything
about Hank Snow.

493
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:17,675
Hank Snow, The Singing Ranger.

494
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:19,740
He's a legend.

495
00:36:19,742 --> 00:36:20,710
Well, why's he called
The Singing Ranger?

496
00:36:21,244 --> 00:36:22,880
Was he a park ranger
or something?

497
00:36:25,382 --> 00:36:26,416
Do you know?

498
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:28,753
I... I never thought about it.

499
00:36:29,985 --> 00:36:31,154
Okay, we're done.

500
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,524
See ya', Leo.

501
00:36:41,831 --> 00:36:43,034
You own the whole house?

502
00:36:44,134 --> 00:36:45,135
Yeah.

503
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,571
Me and Jimmy.

504
00:36:47,503 --> 00:36:48,639
It's a two-family.

505
00:36:48,938 --> 00:36:51,975
Our grandma used to live
downstairs here before she died.

506
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,113
Well, who lives here now?

507
00:36:56,646 --> 00:36:57,581
Nobody.

508
00:36:57,914 --> 00:36:59,380
It's just the way
Grandma left it

509
00:36:59,382 --> 00:37:01,451
before her heart stopped
last Thanksgiving.

510
00:37:03,219 --> 00:37:04,254
Her heart stopped?

511
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:06,257
It quit on her.

512
00:37:09,025 --> 00:37:10,525
Grandma took care
of me and Jimmy

513
00:37:10,527 --> 00:37:11,729
after our parents died.

514
00:37:12,628 --> 00:37:13,730
She was the best.

515
00:37:19,536 --> 00:37:20,771
- Hey.
- Yeah?

516
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:23,240
Do you wanna see it?

517
00:37:39,722 --> 00:37:41,891
Um, this is the dining room.

518
00:37:58,608 --> 00:37:59,943
This is the living room.

519
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:06,584
This is the kitchen.

520
00:38:19,028 --> 00:38:20,164
This is her bedroom.

521
00:38:32,275 --> 00:38:33,443
That's Grandma.

522
00:38:34,244 --> 00:38:36,113
It's the same picture
we have in The Oak.

523
00:38:39,148 --> 00:38:40,817
She bought me my violin.

524
00:38:44,153 --> 00:38:45,623
I used to play it for her...

525
00:38:48,925 --> 00:38:50,027
but no one else.

526
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:55,266
Victor, what happened to you?

527
00:38:57,934 --> 00:38:59,136
You're different, I know.

528
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:01,905
You're not like other people.

529
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:05,008
What happened?

530
00:39:06,009 --> 00:39:07,978
I had an accident
when I was a kid.

531
00:39:09,478 --> 00:39:10,914
It was an act of God.

532
00:39:14,451 --> 00:39:15,485
Yep.

533
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:18,656
An act of God.

534
00:40:27,523 --> 00:40:29,926
- I hope you're hungry.
- I am.

535
00:40:32,929 --> 00:40:34,097
Thank you, Victor.

536
00:40:40,637 --> 00:40:41,638
You didn't want it?

537
00:40:42,204 --> 00:40:45,374
Oh, that was the sweetest thing
that you did that,

538
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:47,210
but I can't take your pillow.

539
00:40:47,677 --> 00:40:48,945
You understand, right?

540
00:40:49,445 --> 00:40:50,811
Why not?

541
00:40:50,813 --> 00:40:52,782
- Are you leaving?
- No, not right now, but...

542
00:40:53,916 --> 00:40:55,217
pretty soon, I'm sure.

543
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:58,556
You know, no one's ever
given me their pillow before.

544
00:41:10,934 --> 00:41:12,102
What are you doing?

545
00:41:15,304 --> 00:41:16,373
What you got there?

546
00:41:16,739 --> 00:41:18,572
- It's for you.
- Hmm?

547
00:41:18,574 --> 00:41:19,675
It's a diamond pin.

548
00:41:19,943 --> 00:41:21,775
Oh, no, no, Victor.

549
00:41:21,777 --> 00:41:22,978
You don't
have to give me presents.

550
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,414
It belonged to my grandmother.

551
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,248
- Victor.
- Open it.

552
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:27,882
- Victor, you...
- Take it.

553
00:41:27,884 --> 00:41:29,853
It's a diamond pin
and it's for you.

554
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:31,719
Victor, you don't even know me.

555
00:41:31,721 --> 00:41:33,690
Please, take it,
it's a diamond pin.

556
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,158
Take it!

557
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,394
Victor.

558
00:41:43,867 --> 00:41:45,202
It's a dime-and-pin,

559
00:41:45,702 --> 00:41:47,037
get it?

560
00:41:50,606 --> 00:41:53,407
Victor, I fucking love it!

561
00:41:54,777 --> 00:41:57,380
Did you think
that I fell in love with you?

562
00:42:01,184 --> 00:42:02,784
It's a Henny Youngman joke.

563
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:04,153
You can give it
to somebody else.

564
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:05,890
You big goof!

565
00:43:15,257 --> 00:43:16,460
Use a fork, will ya'?

566
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,329
I like chopsticks, Jimmy.

567
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:20,762
It's a Chinese restaurant.

568
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,733
All right, well,
we're not in Tokyo now, are we?

569
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:25,636
It's a lousy invention,
use the fork.

570
00:43:26,369 --> 00:43:27,371
Hong Kong.

571
00:43:28,605 --> 00:43:29,606
What?

572
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:35,646
You getting friendly
with this girl, Victor?

573
00:43:36,012 --> 00:43:38,047
- Who?
- Who, you tell me who.

574
00:43:42,918 --> 00:43:44,288
She's my friend, Jimmy.

575
00:43:45,221 --> 00:43:46,188
All right, well...

576
00:43:46,922 --> 00:43:48,458
I don't want you getting
too friendly with her.

577
00:43:49,726 --> 00:43:51,695
She's a pothead,
you know what that means.

578
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:53,930
- She's bad news.
- She's my friend, Jimmy.

579
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:58,099
And she says, she says you
seem like a good person.

580
00:43:58,101 --> 00:43:59,469
Oh, is that what she says, huh?

581
00:43:59,768 --> 00:44:01,304
'Cause she knows me so well.

582
00:44:02,472 --> 00:44:03,674
What do you know
about this girl?

583
00:44:04,307 --> 00:44:05,775
<i>Where's she from?
What's her name?</i>

584
00:44:06,409 --> 00:44:07,677
<i>She don't use a name.</i>

585
00:44:08,244 --> 00:44:09,776
What do you mean,
she don't use a name?

586
00:44:09,778 --> 00:44:10,813
She don't use a name.

587
00:44:11,782 --> 00:44:13,280
<i>See, that's what
I'm talking about.</i>

588
00:44:13,282 --> 00:44:15,318
<i>What kind of a girl
doesn't use a name, huh?</i>

589
00:44:15,652 --> 00:44:17,354
What's she trying to hide,
she don't use a name?

590
00:44:17,653 --> 00:44:20,324
She's the gal
who invented kissing.

591
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,494
Like the Hank Snow song,
The Gal Who Invented Kissing...

592
00:44:26,496 --> 00:44:28,531
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, hold on.

593
00:44:29,065 --> 00:44:30,200
You guys kissed?

594
00:44:33,135 --> 00:44:34,269
Okay, Victor,

595
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:36,306
I don't want you hanging out
with this girl any more.

596
00:44:36,572 --> 00:44:38,238
I don't need this, okay?

597
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,143
I don't need to be watching out
for you all the time.

598
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:42,209
You don't have to watch
out for me, Jimmy...

599
00:44:42,211 --> 00:44:43,213
Oh no?

600
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:44,914
What happened
with the phone booth?

601
00:44:45,648 --> 00:44:46,914
I was pushed.

602
00:44:46,916 --> 00:44:49,182
Pushed by who?
Huh, nobody saw you get pushed.

603
00:44:49,184 --> 00:44:50,684
The girl, she saw it.

604
00:44:50,686 --> 00:44:52,188
Oh, the girl saw you get pushed?

605
00:44:55,891 --> 00:44:56,792
Great.

606
00:44:57,494 --> 00:44:59,496
- What's the matter?
- Nothing, shut up.

607
00:45:00,829 --> 00:45:02,195
Oh, look who it is!

608
00:45:02,197 --> 00:45:03,298
- Hey.
- Hey Vic.

609
00:45:04,132 --> 00:45:05,833
Jimmy, what do you say?
How's everything, how's The Oak?

610
00:45:05,835 --> 00:45:07,670
- Well, you know, still The Oak.
- Yeah, yeah.

611
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,470
How's everything, how's Patti?

612
00:45:09,472 --> 00:45:10,639
She's good. You know,

613
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:11,708
still the same pain in my ass.

614
00:45:12,074 --> 00:45:13,173
We keep missing each other
you know,

615
00:45:13,175 --> 00:45:14,610
I come home, she goes to work.

616
00:45:15,043 --> 00:45:16,543
Plus, I'm out there trying
to get my real estate

617
00:45:16,545 --> 00:45:17,580
license right now.

618
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,878
I'm trying to make some
extra money, you know?

619
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:19,716
I hear you.

620
00:45:21,016 --> 00:45:23,217
Listen, Freddy,
I'm... I'm having this problem.

621
00:45:23,219 --> 00:45:25,754
I got this, uh, this drifter.

622
00:45:26,054 --> 00:45:27,289
She keeps coming in the bar,

623
00:45:27,456 --> 00:45:28,956
she's getting high
in my bathroom all the time,

624
00:45:28,958 --> 00:45:29,925
I mean, what do I do?

625
00:45:30,393 --> 00:45:31,661
Is she selling?

626
00:45:31,894 --> 00:45:33,563
No, no, no, nothing like that,
but I mean, you know.

627
00:45:33,829 --> 00:45:35,162
It's like reefer madness.

628
00:45:35,164 --> 00:45:36,697
I mean, she's getting
high smoking a bone,

629
00:45:36,699 --> 00:45:38,367
the whole place
stinks like weed.

630
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:40,302
Listen, don't worry about it.

631
00:45:40,304 --> 00:45:41,470
Fuck it, you'll be all right.

632
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:43,003
- Yeah?
- Yeah, she comes in again,

633
00:45:43,005 --> 00:45:44,940
you give me a call.
I'll tune her up for you.

634
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:46,410
I'll see you later, Vic.

635
00:45:51,847 --> 00:45:52,981
What?

636
00:46:00,556 --> 00:46:01,424
Hey!

637
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:03,590
No, no, no, no, no.

638
00:46:03,592 --> 00:46:04,627
Not again today.

639
00:46:04,894 --> 00:46:06,260
- You know...
- Nope, no. You gotta go, scram.

640
00:46:06,262 --> 00:46:07,662
I have to use the bathroom,
is that okay?

641
00:46:07,664 --> 00:46:08,996
I don't care,
what are you gonna do,

642
00:46:08,998 --> 00:46:10,197
- smoke a bone in there...
- No, no.

643
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:11,365
No, you have to leave.

644
00:46:11,367 --> 00:46:12,534
Well, we talked
about this already.

645
00:46:12,536 --> 00:46:13,570
- Now!
- I promised, Jimmy.

646
00:46:13,969 --> 00:46:14,668
- I'm trying to run a business!
- Please!

647
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:15,404
I gotta pee!

648
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:16,773
I gotta pee, Jimmy.

649
00:46:17,273 --> 00:46:18,373
Come on.

650
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:19,874
Make it fast.
What is this?

651
00:46:19,876 --> 00:46:21,275
She's gotta pee, she gotta pee.

652
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:50,197
Oh my God, oh my God,
oh my God, oh my God,

653
00:47:50,199 --> 00:47:52,467
oh my God, oh my God, oh my
God, oh my God, oh my God!

654
00:47:57,039 --> 00:47:58,141
There's two guys over there.

655
00:47:58,307 --> 00:47:59,907
They're...
they're sucking each other off,

656
00:47:59,909 --> 00:48:01,376
and they were trying
to get me to watch!

657
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:03,010
All right, hold on,
hold on, relax, come on.

658
00:48:03,012 --> 00:48:04,014
Thank you, sir.

659
00:48:14,356 --> 00:48:15,555
Hey!

660
00:48:15,557 --> 00:48:16,893
What the fuck
you two doing, huh?

661
00:50:48,978 --> 00:50:50,110
You look pretty.

662
00:50:50,112 --> 00:50:51,313
What are you doing,
you going out?

663
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:55,752
Wow!

664
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:57,351
That's it, huh?

665
00:50:57,353 --> 00:50:58,552
One lousy piece of chicken?

666
00:50:58,554 --> 00:50:59,820
So now you're unhappy,
I suppose...

667
00:50:59,822 --> 00:51:01,458
All I'm asking
is if there's any more chicken.

668
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:04,360
Hmm?

669
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:10,400
There, now you got two.

670
00:51:10,699 --> 00:51:11,666
You want three?

671
00:51:11,967 --> 00:51:13,036
Don't know why
you're busting my balls, Patti.

672
00:51:15,672 --> 00:51:16,706
Where were you last night?

673
00:51:17,373 --> 00:51:18,340
Where am I every night?

674
00:51:18,574 --> 00:51:19,840
You stop at that diner?

675
00:51:19,842 --> 00:51:21,309
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

676
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:22,677
- Yeah.
- You had a nice little visit

677
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:24,012
with your waitress friend?

678
00:51:24,179 --> 00:51:26,045
Well, they did serve me coffee
and a fucking brownie,

679
00:51:26,047 --> 00:51:28,883
so, unless brownies are giving
reach-arounds these days...

680
00:51:29,751 --> 00:51:31,119
Come on, what's with all
the questions, huh?

681
00:51:31,786 --> 00:51:33,119
So now I'm picking a fight?

682
00:51:33,121 --> 00:51:34,554
Oh, I get it.

683
00:51:34,556 --> 00:51:35,658
You're on your fucking period.

684
00:51:40,396 --> 00:51:42,298
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

685
00:51:43,833 --> 00:51:45,532
- I'm going out.
- Nice, where you going?

686
00:51:45,534 --> 00:51:46,603
I don't know, out.

687
00:51:47,036 --> 00:51:49,139
Okay, I'll be here
with my one piece of chicken.

688
00:51:49,438 --> 00:51:51,040
Fuckin-A,
I feel like Henry VIII!

689
00:51:57,746 --> 00:51:59,482
Karen LaMonica just went by.

690
00:52:01,583 --> 00:52:04,320
Her son, Mike, he was on
a submarine for two years.

691
00:52:05,922 --> 00:52:07,222
Heard he went AWOL last week.

692
00:52:07,556 --> 00:52:08,424
Oh yeah?

693
00:52:12,228 --> 00:52:13,596
Tell me what you meant
that time.

694
00:52:14,597 --> 00:52:15,598
What?

695
00:52:15,965 --> 00:52:17,266
You remember that time
I had that thing at work?

696
00:52:17,766 --> 00:52:19,400
That guy knocked me down?

697
00:52:19,402 --> 00:52:22,139
You asked me about Freddy,
why I didn't wanna wake him?

698
00:52:23,072 --> 00:52:24,304
What'd you mean?

699
00:52:24,306 --> 00:52:25,641
I don't know,
that was a while ago.

700
00:52:26,108 --> 00:52:27,175
That was three weeks ago.

701
00:52:27,476 --> 00:52:28,411
What'd you mean?

702
00:52:28,811 --> 00:52:29,679
Nothing.

703
00:52:29,945 --> 00:52:30,980
Then why were you asking?

704
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:32,782
I wanna know.

705
00:52:34,416 --> 00:52:35,384
I don't know.

706
00:52:36,251 --> 00:52:37,820
Come on.

707
00:52:40,523 --> 00:52:42,023
I wonder
why you won't just tell me.

708
00:52:42,025 --> 00:52:42,959
Jesus Christ.

709
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:45,862
You know how much those
fucking things weigh?

710
00:52:46,396 --> 00:52:47,427
I can barely roll one.

711
00:52:48,931 --> 00:52:50,199
He just moves them around
like he's Magilla Gorilla.

712
00:53:11,554 --> 00:53:13,088
Do you think Victor's
ever had sex?

713
00:53:15,257 --> 00:53:16,293
What?

714
00:53:17,425 --> 00:53:18,959
He's your brother,
why you asking me?

715
00:53:18,961 --> 00:53:20,762
I just thought that women
had like a sixth sense

716
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:22,195
or something
for that, I don't know.

717
00:53:22,197 --> 00:53:24,701
Wait, you worried
about that girl, the pothead?

718
00:53:26,769 --> 00:53:28,103
Why don't you just ask Victor?

719
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:30,573
Don't you guys talk
about that stuff?

720
00:53:30,873 --> 00:53:33,443
I thought all guys talked
about who they slept with.

721
00:53:37,579 --> 00:53:38,547
Come on.

722
00:53:39,047 --> 00:53:40,081
Tell me what you meant.

723
00:53:40,648 --> 00:53:41,917
I don't know, I...

724
00:53:43,686 --> 00:53:45,788
I don't know, Patti,
some maniac jumps you at work.

725
00:53:46,054 --> 00:53:47,354
You get blood all over you.

726
00:53:47,356 --> 00:53:48,925
You call me
to make you feel better.

727
00:53:51,193 --> 00:53:52,327
Three times, you call me.

728
00:53:53,228 --> 00:53:55,164
Not your husband.
What does that tell you?

729
00:53:57,166 --> 00:53:59,365
He was sleeping,
didn't wanna wake him up.

730
00:53:59,367 --> 00:54:00,568
You'd have woken me up though,
right?

731
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:01,705
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

732
00:54:03,606 --> 00:54:05,242
- That's different.
- Why's it different?

733
00:54:09,744 --> 00:54:11,047
You're beautiful, you know that?

734
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:12,945
Keep dreaming.

735
00:54:12,947 --> 00:54:14,447
Okay, you're right, you're not.

736
00:54:14,449 --> 00:54:15,484
I'm making it all up.

737
00:54:15,751 --> 00:54:16,883
I'm just trying to build
up your self-esteem.

738
00:54:16,885 --> 00:54:17,920
You're actually ugly.

739
00:54:18,586 --> 00:54:19,820
And you're nuts.

740
00:54:19,822 --> 00:54:21,024
Is Freddy nuts too?

741
00:54:23,726 --> 00:54:24,628
Yeah.

742
00:54:26,829 --> 00:54:27,731
I mean...

743
00:54:31,166 --> 00:54:32,369
What are we talking about Jimmy?

744
00:54:34,369 --> 00:54:35,237
Us.

745
00:54:35,905 --> 00:54:37,474
It's not like
that's gonna happen, is it?

746
00:54:37,773 --> 00:54:39,273
It's not like you're
gonna leave Freddy.

747
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:41,811
Who says so?
I look for excuses all the time.

748
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:44,514
- Nice, you need an excuse.
- No!

749
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,581
It's not like you
don't have Victor.

750
00:54:47,583 --> 00:54:48,785
I don't have Victor.

751
00:54:49,686 --> 00:54:51,184
What is that supposed to mean?
Victor's fine

752
00:54:51,186 --> 00:54:52,552
- on his own...
- You know what I mean.

753
00:54:52,554 --> 00:54:53,556
He's like a big kid.

754
00:54:54,389 --> 00:54:57,958
He's sweet, he's like
a big, sweet lummox.

755
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,427
All right,
Victor is not a lummox.

756
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:00,561
I said sweet...

757
00:55:00,563 --> 00:55:01,695
- Oh, that makes it better.
- Lummox.

758
00:55:01,697 --> 00:55:03,063
Well I didn't mean
it in a bad way!

759
00:55:03,065 --> 00:55:04,365
Well, how do you mean it then...

760
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:05,635
- Well, you know...
- Is there a good way?

761
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,235
I wouldn't never talk...
that way about your brother!

762
00:55:08,237 --> 00:55:09,105
You just did.

763
00:55:09,771 --> 00:55:11,007
Look, he is what he is.

764
00:55:11,407 --> 00:55:13,907
There's just plenty a better
choice of words than lummox.

765
00:55:13,909 --> 00:55:14,809
Like what?

766
00:55:15,077 --> 00:55:16,145
Magilla Gorilla?

767
00:55:17,146 --> 00:55:19,545
Come on, you took
it the wrong way.

768
00:55:19,547 --> 00:55:20,649
I'm sorry, okay?

769
00:55:21,184 --> 00:55:23,420
It's just we both have things
that come along with the deal.

770
00:55:26,054 --> 00:55:26,989
Fuck!

771
00:55:28,389 --> 00:55:29,592
What's the matter?

772
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:31,157
I'm missing $2200,
that's what's the matter!

773
00:55:31,159 --> 00:55:33,328
- How?
- It's all fucked up.

774
00:55:33,596 --> 00:55:36,095
Victor loses half
the goddamn bank receipts

775
00:55:36,097 --> 00:55:37,932
and I got nothing to go
on but these shitty books.

776
00:55:37,934 --> 00:55:39,599
I don't know why you
don't have a bookkeeper

777
00:55:39,601 --> 00:55:41,936
- to do all this.
- Just relax, okay?

778
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:43,269
You don't understand relax

779
00:55:43,271 --> 00:55:44,704
and I can't afford
a fucking bookkeeper,

780
00:55:44,706 --> 00:55:47,108
'cause I'm missing $2200,
maybe that's a problem.

781
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:48,275
- Okay.
- I got insurance bills,

782
00:55:48,277 --> 00:55:49,976
car payments, I'm paying off

783
00:55:49,978 --> 00:55:52,181
that stupid,
high-def TV that he wanted.

784
00:55:52,614 --> 00:55:54,615
I'm paying liquor distributors
for this fucking shithole...

785
00:55:54,617 --> 00:55:56,486
Hey stop cursing,
you sound like Freddy!

786
00:56:04,594 --> 00:56:05,760
Hey, Vic.

787
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:07,096
Remember Mike LaMonica?

788
00:56:07,463 --> 00:56:09,530
He went AWOL
on a fucking submarine.

789
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:11,033
How do you do that?
What, did he swim?

790
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:12,833
Fucking Aquaman?

791
00:56:12,835 --> 00:56:14,668
- Hey.
- This is what Patti tells me.

792
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:17,105
If I wanna get yelled at,
I'll go home and get yelled at.

793
00:56:17,706 --> 00:56:19,275
Call me when you're in
a better mood.

794
00:56:32,121 --> 00:56:33,653
Oak.

795
00:56:33,655 --> 00:56:35,655
Jimmy, where are you?

796
00:56:35,657 --> 00:56:37,693
What do you mean, where am I?
You just called me, didn't you?

797
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:39,526
Are you coming home now?

798
00:56:39,528 --> 00:56:40,760
No, how am I gonna come home?

799
00:56:40,762 --> 00:56:41,994
I'm still trying to figure out

800
00:56:41,996 --> 00:56:43,496
where the goddamn
money went, okay?

801
00:56:43,498 --> 00:56:45,199
<i>I'm up to my eyeballs
in fucking paperwork.</i>

802
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:46,599
Just stop calling me
every five minutes,

803
00:56:46,601 --> 00:56:47,733
so I can get this shit done!

804
00:56:47,735 --> 00:56:48,904
Okay, Jimmy.

805
00:56:49,771 --> 00:56:51,238
But you are coming home, right?

806
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,005
Eh, yes no,
maybe, I don't know.

807
00:56:53,007 --> 00:56:55,242
I'll be home
when I'm done with this, okay?

808
00:56:55,244 --> 00:56:56,342
Just stop calling.

809
00:57:38,387 --> 00:57:39,556
Oh!

810
00:57:39,922 --> 00:57:42,524
Um, can you close the door,
it's cold.

811
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:05,849
Would you like some coffee?

812
00:58:06,748 --> 00:58:07,750
Sure.

813
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:09,618
How long have you been
staying here?

814
00:58:10,052 --> 00:58:11,854
Two weeks, on and off.

815
00:58:12,253 --> 00:58:13,989
Now I know where all
the food's been going.

816
00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:17,458
Victor let you in?

817
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:18,528
Of course.

818
00:58:19,927 --> 00:58:21,463
I come in through the basement.

819
00:58:22,831 --> 00:58:23,999
He said he'd talk to you first.

820
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:25,668
You don't say?

821
00:58:26,501 --> 00:58:28,269
I don't suppose
he got the chance?

822
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:29,436
No.

823
00:58:29,438 --> 00:58:30,604
You mad?

824
00:58:30,606 --> 00:58:32,472
Listen, whatever your name is,

825
00:58:32,474 --> 00:58:34,043
I'm really
not in the mood for this.

826
00:58:34,809 --> 00:58:36,175
I'm having a bad day.

827
00:58:36,177 --> 00:58:37,279
It's late.

828
00:58:37,512 --> 00:58:39,715
I'm tired, so just...

829
00:58:40,349 --> 00:58:41,517
What do you want?

830
00:58:41,949 --> 00:58:44,086
I don't suppose you mean
what do I want in my coffee?

831
00:58:45,288 --> 00:58:47,387
Okay, what do you
want in your coffee?

832
00:58:47,389 --> 00:58:49,356
I'm not really a coffee person.

833
00:58:49,358 --> 00:58:50,593
Can I have tea?

834
00:58:52,628 --> 00:58:54,161
- I know what you're thinking.
- Do you?

835
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:56,028
You think I'm taking
advantage of your brother.

836
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:57,498
- And?
- Well, you're wrong.

837
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,032
I know he's different and

838
00:58:59,034 --> 00:59:01,135
I know people around here
treat him like shit

839
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:02,371
and he doesn't deserve it.

840
00:59:02,972 --> 00:59:05,371
And I respect you
for taking care of him,

841
00:59:05,373 --> 00:59:07,576
and looking out for him.
If you weren't suspicious,

842
00:59:08,143 --> 00:59:09,709
then you wouldn't be
much of a brother.

843
00:59:09,711 --> 00:59:11,512
- Can we cut the shit?
- It's not shit!

844
00:59:11,514 --> 00:59:13,046
What do you want?
What are you looking for?

845
00:59:13,048 --> 00:59:14,717
I just wanted
to be his friend.

846
00:59:15,516 --> 00:59:16,585
His friend?

847
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:18,552
Is that what you
think Victor thinks,

848
00:59:18,554 --> 00:59:20,154
- that you're his friend?
- Yeah, I do.

849
00:59:20,856 --> 00:59:22,291
No, no, no, no. See, you,

850
00:59:22,557 --> 00:59:24,460
you're the girl
who invented kissing.

851
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:26,596
He told you that.

852
00:59:27,329 --> 00:59:28,561
That's my fault.

853
00:59:28,563 --> 00:59:30,065
I told him to pick out
a name for me.

854
00:59:30,965 --> 00:59:32,065
Well?

855
00:59:32,067 --> 00:59:33,335
What is your name?

856
00:59:33,702 --> 00:59:35,103
Look, do you want me to leave?

857
00:59:35,804 --> 00:59:36,873
'Cause I will.

858
00:59:37,373 --> 00:59:39,742
I'm used to taking care
of myself, it's what I do.

859
00:59:40,476 --> 00:59:42,008
You mean like with my money?

860
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:43,209
What money?

861
00:59:43,211 --> 00:59:44,211
Victor didn't mention
anything to you

862
00:59:44,213 --> 00:59:45,512
about the bar missing any money?

863
00:59:45,514 --> 00:59:46,646
No, asshole!

864
00:59:46,648 --> 00:59:48,150
I don't appreciate
the accusation!

865
00:59:48,583 --> 00:59:49,883
- Hey!
- If you got nothing to hide,

866
00:59:49,885 --> 00:59:51,084
- you got nothing to worry about.
- Hey,

867
00:59:51,086 --> 00:59:52,588
what the fuck
are you doing?

868
00:59:53,755 --> 00:59:55,824
- What do you got in here, huh?
- No one touches my fucking shit!

869
00:59:56,291 --> 00:59:57,326
Asshole!

870
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:00,762
Don't think I'm afraid of you
'cause I'm not, motherfucker!

871
01:00:06,902 --> 01:00:08,471
Get the fuck off of me.

872
01:01:02,958 --> 01:01:04,494
I'm sorry I didn't come home
last night.

873
01:01:06,494 --> 01:01:08,597
I know I told you I said
I would and I didn't.

874
01:01:10,666 --> 01:01:12,669
So, let's just leave it
at that, okay?

875
01:01:17,773 --> 01:01:19,142
Why is there three?

876
01:01:21,143 --> 01:01:22,911
- It's a tea.
- A tea?

877
01:01:27,882 --> 01:01:28,984
Morning.

878
01:01:30,818 --> 01:01:32,021
Morning.

879
01:01:32,887 --> 01:01:35,223
Oh, thank you.

880
01:01:36,992 --> 01:01:39,193
Uh, would you
like some breakfast?

881
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:40,360
No, thank you.

882
01:01:40,362 --> 01:01:42,130
Breakfast makes me pokey.

883
01:01:43,699 --> 01:01:44,867
Hey, Jimmy?

884
01:01:45,333 --> 01:01:46,402
Did you find that money?

885
01:01:46,668 --> 01:01:47,703
No.

886
01:01:49,304 --> 01:01:50,638
What happened?

887
01:01:51,206 --> 01:01:53,005
Jimmy lost $2200.

888
01:01:53,007 --> 01:01:55,710
Okay, I didn't lose $2200.

889
01:01:56,512 --> 01:01:58,644
The books are short,
that's all, so whatever I did,

890
01:01:58,646 --> 01:01:59,782
whether I added wrong...

891
01:02:01,083 --> 01:02:02,018
let's just drop it

892
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:04,019
Okay, you can't unring a bell.

893
01:02:05,487 --> 01:02:07,056
Maybe you should
hire a bookkeeper.

894
01:02:09,958 --> 01:02:11,624
Happy Thanksgiving, guys.

895
01:02:11,626 --> 01:02:14,394
- Happy Thanksgiving, guys.
- Look at the size of that thing.

896
01:02:14,396 --> 01:02:16,164
I've got 27 pounds.

897
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:19,868
What do you think, Vic?

898
01:02:20,335 --> 01:02:21,534
I've never seen
something like that before.

899
01:02:21,536 --> 01:02:23,105
You never seen
a turkey before?

900
01:02:24,239 --> 01:02:25,474
Hey, Jimmy.

901
01:02:27,009 --> 01:02:28,945
- What's up?
- She's invited, right?

902
01:02:31,713 --> 01:02:33,514
Yeah, of course.
It's Thanksgiving, right?

903
01:02:33,516 --> 01:02:34,650
Yeah.

904
01:02:34,949 --> 01:02:36,751
Turkey bowl!

905
01:02:44,893 --> 01:02:48,763
So, it's you and you,
me, Donnie, Phil,

906
01:02:49,597 --> 01:02:51,731
Freddy, Patti,
Irene, Irene's mom.

907
01:02:51,733 --> 01:02:52,932
Mm-hmm.

908
01:02:58,773 --> 01:03:00,807
What is it?
Hour every three pounds or so?

909
01:03:00,809 --> 01:03:02,011
Something like that.

910
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:03,610
Frigging thing's so big,
I've moved all the racks,

911
01:03:03,612 --> 01:03:04,912
it still barely fits in.

912
01:03:04,914 --> 01:03:06,579
Guy's like a 35-pound
monster in there.

913
01:03:06,581 --> 01:03:07,817
Yeah, right?

914
01:03:08,784 --> 01:03:10,586
Gonna go for a smoke.
Coming?

915
01:03:10,853 --> 01:03:11,820
- No.
- No.

916
01:03:13,288 --> 01:03:14,920
I'm gonna stay here
and chill with James, all right?

917
01:03:14,922 --> 01:03:16,224
Keep him company.

918
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:22,195
Everything under control
over there, buddy?

919
01:03:22,197 --> 01:03:23,329
Need any help?

920
01:03:23,331 --> 01:03:24,764
Nah, we're good, Fred, thanks.

921
01:03:24,766 --> 01:03:25,768
All right.

922
01:03:26,168 --> 01:03:28,068
How's The Oak? Still got
that chick coming in there

923
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:29,637
who was blazing up
the weed in the bathroom?

924
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:30,938
No, no, we took care of that.

925
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:32,541
- Oh, you did?
- Thank you, yeah.

926
01:03:41,215 --> 01:03:42,652
Hey, Jimmy, let me
ask you something.

927
01:03:43,851 --> 01:03:45,821
You ever see Patti
in there with anybody?

928
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:50,123
You mean like,
with a guy or something?

929
01:03:50,125 --> 01:03:51,724
Yeah, like, with a guy,
you know,

930
01:03:51,726 --> 01:03:53,659
like someone
that's not me, behind my back.

931
01:03:53,661 --> 01:03:55,997
No, no, nothing like that.

932
01:03:56,297 --> 01:03:57,865
- Patti's a good lady.
- Yeah.

933
01:03:58,266 --> 01:03:59,599
She comes in with Barbara,
that's all.

934
01:03:59,601 --> 01:04:01,101
Barbara!

935
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:02,137
Jesus.

936
01:04:02,436 --> 01:04:03,670
You know, you got that
one that's married,

937
01:04:03,672 --> 01:04:04,773
then you got one who's single,

938
01:04:05,141 --> 01:04:06,673
the single one starts chirping
in the married one's ear

939
01:04:06,675 --> 01:04:09,512
- and hello, here we go.
- I wouldn't worry about it.

940
01:04:10,144 --> 01:04:11,246
But you know me.

941
01:04:11,646 --> 01:04:13,114
I'm fucking psycho, man,
I will put someone in the dirt!

942
01:04:13,414 --> 01:04:14,382
Yeah.

943
01:04:15,817 --> 01:04:17,219
Aw, fuck!

944
01:04:18,152 --> 01:04:19,454
I'm fucking paranoid!

945
01:04:20,021 --> 01:04:21,088
Jesus Christ,

946
01:04:21,356 --> 01:04:22,856
I wish that Barb would
just find a man already!

947
01:04:22,858 --> 01:04:24,026
Yeah, right?

948
01:04:25,226 --> 01:04:27,596
All right, anyway.

949
01:04:29,498 --> 01:04:32,965
Hey, who's that hot piece
of ass in there you knew?

950
01:04:32,967 --> 01:04:34,233
You hitting that shit?

951
01:04:34,235 --> 01:04:36,536
No, no, that's Victor's friend.

952
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:39,608
- Fuck outta here with that!
- Why, it's not funny.

953
01:04:39,976 --> 01:04:41,441
Just relax,
I'm not saying nothing.

954
01:04:41,443 --> 01:04:43,912
It's just that, I don't know,
she looks familiar.

955
01:04:44,612 --> 01:04:46,047
I swear I've seen her before.

956
01:04:48,717 --> 01:04:50,816
All right, coming in hot!

957
01:04:51,887 --> 01:04:52,985
- Wow!
- Nice.

958
01:04:52,987 --> 01:04:54,723
Nice, good job, boys.

959
01:04:57,860 --> 01:04:59,595
All right, Victor, the grace.

960
01:04:59,994 --> 01:05:01,763
- Okay.
- Can I?

961
01:05:02,597 --> 01:05:04,065
That's if Victor doesn't mind.

962
01:05:04,833 --> 01:05:06,333
But Victor always does
the grace.

963
01:05:06,335 --> 01:05:07,470
I don't mind, Jimmy.

964
01:05:07,936 --> 01:05:08,871
Thanks.

965
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:10,936
All right.

966
01:05:10,938 --> 01:05:13,407
I, uh, I don't really make it
to church ever,

967
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:15,307
but I just wanna
thank Jimmy and Victor

968
01:05:15,309 --> 01:05:16,844
for inviting me into their home.

969
01:05:17,411 --> 01:05:20,281
I pray the universe will help
those in their time of need,

970
01:05:20,548 --> 01:05:24,583
pain, sorrow and sadness,
and give them hope,

971
01:05:24,585 --> 01:05:27,088
strength,
and happiness to carry on.

972
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:30,392
And if on this day,
you can remember the poor,

973
01:05:30,759 --> 01:05:35,298
the sick, the homeless,
and most especially, the lonely.

974
01:05:36,864 --> 01:05:37,965
I'm hungry.

975
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:41,336
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

976
01:05:43,070 --> 01:05:44,237
What do you want, this?

977
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:45,940
Oh!

978
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:47,606
- I'm sorry.
- Vic!

979
01:05:47,608 --> 01:05:49,510
Aw, Irene, don't worry about it.

980
01:05:50,545 --> 01:05:52,079
Come here, come here,
we'll figure it out.

981
01:05:52,547 --> 01:05:54,115
- I'll get it!
- I got it. I got it!

982
01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:03,458
Hey.

983
01:06:04,425 --> 01:06:05,628
Mind if I join you?

984
01:06:07,494 --> 01:06:09,030
No, I don't mind.

985
01:06:18,907 --> 01:06:20,076
I love your hair.

986
01:06:20,909 --> 01:06:22,010
Thanks.

987
01:06:26,782 --> 01:06:28,581
So how long have you
known Jimmy and Victor?

988
01:06:28,583 --> 01:06:29,818
God!

989
01:06:31,018 --> 01:06:32,019
Long time.

990
01:06:32,519 --> 01:06:34,322
Since junior high.

991
01:06:34,922 --> 01:06:36,458
Jimmy was my prom date.

992
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:42,998
He says you're
not from around here.

993
01:06:43,264 --> 01:06:44,132
No.

994
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:48,137
I'm just from here, there,
but mostly there.

995
01:06:50,005 --> 01:06:52,307
He says you and Victor
been hanging out a lot.

996
01:06:53,675 --> 01:06:54,776
Yeah.

997
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:57,479
- Victor's a real sweetheart.
- Yeah.

998
01:06:57,813 --> 01:06:59,015
They're both nice boys.

999
01:07:00,481 --> 01:07:02,317
So, you know what happened,
then?

1000
01:07:03,851 --> 01:07:06,554
- What do you mean?
- He said it was an act of God.

1001
01:07:06,889 --> 01:07:07,890
Hmm.

1002
01:07:10,324 --> 01:07:12,260
It wasn't an act of God.

1003
01:07:13,628 --> 01:07:16,699
Old man was a drunk,
running the same bar.

1004
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:21,403
He was picking them up
at Turtleback Zoo in the winter,

1005
01:07:21,702 --> 01:07:23,871
Jimmy, Victor, their mother.

1006
01:07:24,338 --> 01:07:26,007
He turned up an hour late.

1007
01:07:26,809 --> 01:07:29,545
He was drunk
after a day at The Oak.

1008
01:07:30,211 --> 01:07:31,179
He, uh...

1009
01:07:32,146 --> 01:07:33,449
told them to get in the car...

1010
01:07:35,550 --> 01:07:37,385
and then he drove it
off the bridge...

1011
01:07:38,219 --> 01:07:39,855
into the fucking Passaic.

1012
01:07:40,588 --> 01:07:41,956
Their parents both died.

1013
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:44,093
Victor was the only one
to make it out,

1014
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:45,894
but he went back in.

1015
01:07:46,661 --> 01:07:48,864
He went back into
the freezing water.

1016
01:07:49,697 --> 01:07:51,065
He pulled Jimmy out.

1017
01:07:51,365 --> 01:07:52,835
- Victor did that?
- Yeah!

1018
01:07:53,467 --> 01:07:54,702
Almost drowned.

1019
01:07:55,336 --> 01:07:57,672
By the time the police
turned up, he was...

1020
01:07:59,574 --> 01:08:01,375
he was floating in the water.

1021
01:08:02,242 --> 01:08:05,246
He'd lost oxygen in his brain,
he went half deaf.

1022
01:08:06,181 --> 01:08:07,449
God...

1023
01:08:08,349 --> 01:08:09,485
that's so sad.

1024
01:08:10,684 --> 01:08:12,387
He saved Jimmy's life.

1025
01:08:15,056 --> 01:08:16,725
I guess there's your act of God.

1026
01:08:25,199 --> 01:08:27,235
Does it bother you, what you do?

1027
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:29,201
Does what bother me?

1028
01:08:29,203 --> 01:08:31,704
Being on your own,
sleeping outside,

1029
01:08:31,706 --> 01:08:33,641
sleeping in strange places.

1030
01:08:34,909 --> 01:08:36,342
No.

1031
01:08:36,344 --> 01:08:38,346
Come on, there's a lot
of crazy people out there.

1032
01:08:38,613 --> 01:08:42,183
Yeah, well, they better be
careful, that's all I can say.

1033
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:43,883
I may not look tough,

1034
01:08:43,885 --> 01:08:45,354
but I'm not afraid
to protect myself.

1035
01:08:48,489 --> 01:08:50,557
My first day
in the park here, you know,

1036
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:51,958
some guy wanted to get high
with me,

1037
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:53,328
so I was like, yeah, okay.

1038
01:08:54,061 --> 01:08:55,896
We did an A-bomb
and some uppies,

1039
01:08:55,898 --> 01:08:58,033
and then he started grabbing me,
and I didn't want him to.

1040
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:01,536
Wasn't really anything, I just
didn't want him touching me,

1041
01:09:01,903 --> 01:09:03,503
and he wouldn't cut it out.

1042
01:09:03,505 --> 01:09:04,771
What'd you do?

1043
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:05,940
Stabbed him.

1044
01:09:07,742 --> 01:09:10,076
What, did he die?

1045
01:09:10,078 --> 01:09:12,413
I doubt it,
I stabbed him in the ass.

1046
01:09:13,582 --> 01:09:15,150
Someone
stabbed my ass!

1047
01:09:16,117 --> 01:09:18,086
I just might've
given it to him if he asked...

1048
01:09:18,987 --> 01:09:21,321
but some people figure they
can just take what they want,

1049
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:22,591
and who gives a shit?

1050
01:09:23,091 --> 01:09:24,391
But when they take
what they want,

1051
01:09:24,393 --> 01:09:25,791
and you're not ready to give,

1052
01:09:25,793 --> 01:09:27,762
then what's taken
can never be replaced.

1053
01:09:28,063 --> 01:09:29,632
You stay that way forever.

1054
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:34,133
I look around and I see people
who've been taking,

1055
01:09:34,135 --> 01:09:36,539
and I see people who've been
taken from their whole lives.

1056
01:09:38,506 --> 01:09:39,839
I look at you.

1057
01:09:39,841 --> 01:09:41,210
You look at me how?

1058
01:09:42,810 --> 01:09:44,045
- I don't know.
- Come on...

1059
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:46,447
what does that mean?

1060
01:09:46,747 --> 01:09:48,750
I just mean, how long have you
been taking from Jimmy?

1061
01:09:51,787 --> 01:09:53,521
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1062
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:57,190
I meant how long
have you been screwing him

1063
01:09:57,192 --> 01:09:58,661
behind your husband's back?

1064
01:10:06,734 --> 01:10:08,268
I don't care
how many drug dealers

1065
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:09,271
you stabbed in the ass,

1066
01:10:10,037 --> 01:10:11,539
you keep your mouth shut.

1067
01:10:11,974 --> 01:10:13,475
You come here to make trouble?

1068
01:10:16,011 --> 01:10:17,746
You got off on the wrong stop.

1069
01:10:18,846 --> 01:10:20,315
Leave Victor alone.

1070
01:10:21,483 --> 01:10:23,485
Stay the fuck away
from Jimmy too.

1071
01:10:24,152 --> 01:10:25,753
Get back on the fucking bus!

1072
01:10:26,721 --> 01:10:27,722
You tramp!

1073
01:10:34,895 --> 01:10:36,163
Thanks for the cigarette.

1074
01:10:54,181 --> 01:10:55,283
Hey, Victor.

1075
01:10:56,051 --> 01:10:57,418
I'm a little tired.

1076
01:10:57,886 --> 01:11:00,623
You mind if I go upstairs
and lie on your bed for a while?

1077
01:11:01,956 --> 01:11:02,992
Sure.

1078
01:11:54,909 --> 01:11:57,211
<i>Victor,
I got a good idea.</i>

1079
01:11:58,246 --> 01:11:59,978
Let's bury ourselves,
and then when someone comes by,

1080
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:01,613
we'll jump out and scare
the crap out of them!

1081
01:12:01,615 --> 01:12:02,784
- Come on!
- Yeah, yeah.

1082
01:12:10,458 --> 01:12:11,492
- Okay.
- Okay?

1083
01:12:23,305 --> 01:12:24,273
Victor?

1084
01:12:26,106 --> 01:12:27,475
Someone coming?

1085
01:12:30,979 --> 01:12:33,449
If you could do anything,
I mean...

1086
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:36,081
if you had the money to do

1087
01:12:36,083 --> 01:12:37,353
something you always wanted
to do...

1088
01:12:39,087 --> 01:12:40,356
what would it be?

1089
01:12:44,391 --> 01:12:45,327
Like...

1090
01:12:46,194 --> 01:12:47,830
- anything?
- Anything.

1091
01:12:50,064 --> 01:12:51,363
Is there something
you always wanted to do,

1092
01:12:51,365 --> 01:12:52,734
but you
couldn't afford to do it?

1093
01:12:59,474 --> 01:13:01,877
I would wanna buy
Jimmy a new car.

1094
01:13:03,878 --> 01:13:04,746
No.

1095
01:13:05,479 --> 01:13:08,516
Something for yourself,
not necessarily an object but...

1096
01:13:10,518 --> 01:13:12,287
is there someplace
you never been...

1097
01:13:13,387 --> 01:13:15,189
something you always
wanted to see?

1098
01:13:22,463 --> 01:13:25,567
I've... I've never been
to the Grand Ole Opry.

1099
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,335
It's in Nashville.

1100
01:13:27,636 --> 01:13:30,338
It's where Ernie Tubb
discovered Hank Snow.

1101
01:13:31,072 --> 01:13:32,541
It's where his memorial is.

1102
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:34,743
Well, let's do it!

1103
01:13:35,076 --> 01:13:36,110
Let's go there!

1104
01:13:37,244 --> 01:13:38,180
Go there?

1105
01:13:39,381 --> 01:13:40,249
How?

1106
01:13:41,048 --> 01:13:42,684
Well never mind how.

1107
01:13:43,051 --> 01:13:44,052
Listen...

1108
01:13:45,353 --> 01:13:46,421
I have some money.

1109
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:49,323
It's just money to spend
for something like this. It's...

1110
01:13:49,957 --> 01:13:51,960
money no one cares
about any more.

1111
01:13:53,795 --> 01:13:54,730
Yeah?

1112
01:13:56,130 --> 01:13:57,297
Fuck!

1113
01:13:57,631 --> 01:13:58,634
Come on!

1114
01:14:03,238 --> 01:14:06,141
We'll go out,
we'll get all new outfits,

1115
01:14:06,541 --> 01:14:08,911
I'll buy some makeup
and paint my nails.

1116
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:11,780
We'll go get the bus tickets
and we'll leave tomorrow.

1117
01:14:15,884 --> 01:14:16,752
Come on.

1118
01:14:17,351 --> 01:14:18,386
Listen...

1119
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:22,757
this will just be
our little secret, okay?

1120
01:14:24,391 --> 01:14:25,790
<i>But what about Jimmy?</i>

1121
01:14:25,792 --> 01:14:27,125
<i>Don't worry
about Jimmy.</i>

1122
01:14:27,127 --> 01:14:29,063
<i>We'll write Jimmy a postcard.</i>

1123
01:14:51,452 --> 01:14:52,488
Psst!

1124
01:15:12,774 --> 01:15:13,642
You like?

1125
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:16,545
Um, you got no pants.

1126
01:15:17,945 --> 01:15:19,146
You like purple, right?

1127
01:15:19,648 --> 01:15:21,214
Mm-hmm.

1128
01:15:21,216 --> 01:15:23,485
Hey, wait a minute, I got
a few others I wanna show you.

1129
01:15:25,153 --> 01:15:26,554
Oh, no.

1130
01:15:27,021 --> 01:15:29,690
Where are you going?
Hey, it's okay.

1131
01:15:30,423 --> 01:15:31,659
We're buds, right?

1132
01:15:33,662 --> 01:15:34,730
Victor?

1133
01:15:36,297 --> 01:15:38,533
Haven't you ever seen
a girl undress before?

1134
01:15:39,833 --> 01:15:40,967
It's okay,

1135
01:15:40,969 --> 01:15:42,470
there's nothing
to be ashamed of.

1136
01:15:43,104 --> 01:15:44,239
They're just titties.

1137
01:15:44,639 --> 01:15:46,240
You don't have to be shy.

1138
01:15:50,311 --> 01:15:51,279
Do you wanna touch me, Victor?

1139
01:15:53,014 --> 01:15:56,618
You don't have to,
but if you want to, if you're...

1140
01:15:57,818 --> 01:15:59,087
if you're curious.

1141
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:01,055
Here.

1142
01:16:04,559 --> 01:16:05,761
How's that feel?

1143
01:16:09,063 --> 01:16:10,097
Soft, right?

1144
01:16:25,579 --> 01:16:26,582
Victor.

1145
01:16:28,483 --> 01:16:31,186
- Victor, what's the matter?
- Oh, no.

1146
01:16:32,086 --> 01:16:33,221
- Oh, fuck!
- Oh, no.

1147
01:16:33,921 --> 01:16:35,356
- Oh, no.
- Victor,

1148
01:16:35,689 --> 01:16:36,856
Victor, look what I made you do.

1149
01:16:36,858 --> 01:16:38,090
No, it's not funny.

1150
01:16:38,092 --> 01:16:40,860
Victor, you came!

1151
01:16:40,862 --> 01:16:42,527
Victor, you came!

1152
01:16:47,402 --> 01:16:49,738
- Shit! Let's get out of here.
- It's not funny.

1153
01:16:57,878 --> 01:16:58,947
Shh.

1154
01:17:09,823 --> 01:17:12,925
Hey, heads up,
scumbag, you're under arrest.

1155
01:17:12,927 --> 01:17:14,794
- Hiya, Freddy.
- What are you doing there, Vic.

1156
01:17:14,796 --> 01:17:16,294
Huh? You staying out of trouble?

1157
01:17:16,296 --> 01:17:17,629
Yeah?

1158
01:17:17,631 --> 01:17:18,830
Hey Vic, when are you
gonna play us something

1159
01:17:18,832 --> 01:17:19,967
on your violin there?

1160
01:17:20,301 --> 01:17:21,601
- Someday.
- No, come on, man,

1161
01:17:21,603 --> 01:17:23,538
- I want to hear maestro...
- Nolan, stop!

1162
01:17:24,605 --> 01:17:26,138
Come on, Vic's a good guy.

1163
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:28,609
But seriously Vic,
Patti says you're pretty good.

1164
01:17:28,909 --> 01:17:30,211
What, do you only
play for the chicks?

1165
01:17:30,612 --> 01:17:31,712
No.

1166
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:33,748
Oh, I don't know,
Patti says you're good.

1167
01:17:34,248 --> 01:17:36,115
What about your girlfriend,
you play for her?

1168
01:17:36,117 --> 01:17:37,619
She's not my girlfriend, Freddy.

1169
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:39,818
We're just good friends.

1170
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:42,090
Okay, what about Patti?

1171
01:17:42,489 --> 01:17:44,326
Jimmy and Patti
are just good friends, too.

1172
01:17:44,826 --> 01:17:46,558
Oh, you fucking knucklehead.

1173
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,995
What I'm saying is,
Patti said that you're good,

1174
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:50,798
so she must've heard
you play, right?

1175
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:54,469
No, she's never heard me
play before.

1176
01:17:55,837 --> 01:17:58,140
All right, Victor, you just stay
out of trouble, all right?

1177
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,606
Hey, hold on a second.

1178
01:18:00,608 --> 01:18:02,577
Vic, come here, I just wanna
talk you to for a second, okay?

1179
01:18:07,347 --> 01:18:08,250
Look...

1180
01:18:09,449 --> 01:18:10,318
Vic...

1181
01:18:11,118 --> 01:18:12,319
what'd you mean by...

1182
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:15,187
"Jimmy and Patti are
just good friends,"

1183
01:18:15,189 --> 01:18:17,659
like I know it's true,
but what does that mean?

1184
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:20,527
Jimmy...

1185
01:18:21,128 --> 01:18:24,231
Jimmy said him and Patti
are just good friends, Freddy.

1186
01:18:26,234 --> 01:18:27,569
Oh, when did he say that?

1187
01:18:30,838 --> 01:18:32,340
See, it's weird to me,
it's like,

1188
01:18:32,974 --> 01:18:35,342
why would he say that
like why would he say that

1189
01:18:35,676 --> 01:18:36,976
him and Patti
are just good friends,

1190
01:18:36,978 --> 01:18:38,046
I don't understand.

1191
01:18:39,346 --> 01:18:40,581
Because she's his friend.

1192
01:18:43,484 --> 01:18:44,418
You're right.

1193
01:18:45,052 --> 01:18:47,387
Jesus Christ, sometimes I can
be a knucklehead too, Vic.

1194
01:18:47,721 --> 01:18:50,824
Hey, thanks for your help,
I appreciate it, all right?

1195
01:18:51,492 --> 01:18:53,729
Now you stay outta trouble,
you understand?

1196
01:18:57,030 --> 01:18:58,233
Let's get outta here.

1197
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:51,586
- Oak.
<i>- Jimmy, don't come over.</i>

1198
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:54,018
<i>It's Freddy.</i>

1199
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:55,353
- What's the matter, what's up?
<i>- He knows.</i>

1200
01:19:55,355 --> 01:19:57,824
He had a fit,
he was going crazy!

1201
01:19:58,426 --> 01:19:59,960
<i>He said he talked to Victor.</i>

1202
01:20:00,461 --> 01:20:02,297
<i>He said Victor said something.</i>

1203
01:20:04,097 --> 01:20:05,300
He wouldn't listen to me,

1204
01:20:05,466 --> 01:20:07,469
I mean, he was acting
like a fucking maniac!

1205
01:20:08,670 --> 01:20:11,640
- Are you all right?
<i>- Yeah, I'm okay.</i>

1206
01:20:12,472 --> 01:20:13,507
Jimmy...

1207
01:20:15,743 --> 01:20:16,844
be careful.

1208
01:20:19,913 --> 01:20:20,849
Fuck!

1209
01:20:41,969 --> 01:20:43,337
Heya, Jimmy.

1210
01:20:44,637 --> 01:20:45,806
How is The Oak?

1211
01:20:46,573 --> 01:20:47,509
Well, Victor...

1212
01:20:48,908 --> 01:20:50,110
if you ever bothered to show up

1213
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:51,744
once in a while, then you
wouldn't have to ask me,

1214
01:20:51,746 --> 01:20:52,681
now would you?

1215
01:20:53,780 --> 01:20:55,149
Does it need any help?

1216
01:20:55,483 --> 01:20:56,851
What did you say to Freddy?

1217
01:20:57,118 --> 01:20:58,252
Freddy?

1218
01:20:58,551 --> 01:21:00,353
You said something
to Freddy about me and Patti.

1219
01:21:00,787 --> 01:21:02,289
Now what did you say?

1220
01:21:02,957 --> 01:21:04,159
I just said that...

1221
01:21:06,027 --> 01:21:08,496
you said that you and Patti
were just friends.

1222
01:21:11,698 --> 01:21:12,833
You know, Victor...

1223
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:16,503
half the time I talk to you
I get nothing but shrugs,

1224
01:21:17,238 --> 01:21:20,240
but when you open your mouth,
boy, do you open your mouth.

1225
01:21:21,141 --> 01:21:22,840
Now there's a good chance
that when I go in

1226
01:21:22,842 --> 01:21:24,809
to open up tomorrow morning,
Freddy's gonna be there

1227
01:21:24,811 --> 01:21:26,014
to rip my head off.

1228
01:21:26,346 --> 01:21:27,715
- Jimmy, I...
- Just!

1229
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:31,018
do me a favor
and just shut up!

1230
01:21:31,519 --> 01:21:33,785
You did enough
goddamn damage for one night!

1231
01:21:33,787 --> 01:21:35,989
Don't yell at me, Jimmy.

1232
01:21:36,222 --> 01:21:37,990
I'm tired of you yelling at me!

1233
01:21:37,992 --> 01:21:40,793
Well then, stop fucking
embarrassing me all the time!

1234
01:21:40,795 --> 01:21:43,361
Don't talk to me like that,
Jimmy, I'm your older brother!

1235
01:21:43,363 --> 01:21:44,996
Well then, start acting like it

1236
01:21:44,998 --> 01:21:47,366
and stop being
such a goddamn lummox!

1237
01:21:47,368 --> 01:21:49,536
- Don't you call me that, Jimmy.
- Why not?

1238
01:21:49,804 --> 01:21:51,536
You don't even know
what one means!

1239
01:21:51,538 --> 01:21:53,840
Otherwise you wouldn't
keep acting like one!

1240
01:21:54,975 --> 01:21:57,809
Here, here, people been
calling you one all your life,

1241
01:21:57,811 --> 01:21:59,346
it's about time you look it up!

1242
01:21:59,913 --> 01:22:01,013
Lummox!

1243
01:22:01,015 --> 01:22:02,313
It's under L!

1244
01:22:02,315 --> 01:22:03,251
Look it up!

1245
01:22:06,186 --> 01:22:08,154
I'm not a lummox, Jimmy!

1246
01:22:08,454 --> 01:22:09,823
I'm your brother!

1247
01:22:10,190 --> 01:22:12,626
<i>You're supposed
to take care of me!</i>

1248
01:22:14,595 --> 01:22:16,463
<i>And I'm your older brother!</i>

1249
01:22:17,765 --> 01:22:18,863
<i>You forget that?</i>

1250
01:22:18,865 --> 01:22:20,301
I'm your older brother!

1251
01:22:23,137 --> 01:22:24,471
<i>You don't call me that!</i>

1252
01:22:25,072 --> 01:22:26,608
<i>Huh, Jimmy, you hear me?</i>

1253
01:22:27,274 --> 01:22:28,540
<i>You!</i>

1254
01:22:28,542 --> 01:22:30,010
<i>You don't call me that!</i>

1255
01:24:00,801 --> 01:24:02,202
- I'm sorry.
- Shut up.

1256
01:24:07,474 --> 01:24:09,411
- What do you wanna do, Freddy?
- I swear to God.

1257
01:24:19,686 --> 01:24:20,954
Go home, Victor.

1258
01:24:22,756 --> 01:24:24,022
You okay, Jimmy?

1259
01:24:24,024 --> 01:24:25,057
I'm fine.

1260
01:24:25,059 --> 01:24:26,795
Jimmy, get Vic outta here.

1261
01:24:28,395 --> 01:24:30,532
- I'm not leaving, Freddy.
- Victor, go home!

1262
01:24:31,198 --> 01:24:32,132
No.

1263
01:24:33,167 --> 01:24:34,666
I'm not leaving, Jimmy.

1264
01:24:34,668 --> 01:24:36,001
Get him outta here, Jimmy!

1265
01:24:36,003 --> 01:24:38,003
- Victor, go home!
- No!

1266
01:24:38,005 --> 01:24:39,539
I'm warning you, Vic,

1267
01:24:39,873 --> 01:24:42,376
this is between me
and your brother, Jimmy.

1268
01:24:47,515 --> 01:24:49,680
You leave
my little brother alone.

1269
01:24:49,682 --> 01:24:51,019
Victor, go home!

1270
01:24:51,418 --> 01:24:52,519
No!

1271
01:25:02,061 --> 01:25:03,131
Hey, Freddy?

1272
01:25:04,097 --> 01:25:05,363
What?

1273
01:25:05,365 --> 01:25:06,400
Look, this is important.

1274
01:25:37,163 --> 01:25:38,131
You okay, Jimmy?

1275
01:25:38,731 --> 01:25:41,136
It's over now, just go home.

1276
01:26:28,548 --> 01:26:29,684
Okay.

1277
01:26:30,518 --> 01:26:31,485
It's okay.

1278
01:27:05,886 --> 01:27:07,021
Hey, Jimmy.

1279
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:09,356
What are you doing home?

1280
01:27:10,690 --> 01:27:12,726
I mean, who's watching The Oak?

1281
01:27:13,894 --> 01:27:14,862
That's...

1282
01:27:15,896 --> 01:27:18,466
some shirt
you got there, Victor, that new?

1283
01:27:19,899 --> 01:27:21,435
My friend bought it for me.

1284
01:27:22,537 --> 01:27:23,605
So, the girl?

1285
01:27:29,409 --> 01:27:30,912
What's the matter, Jimmy?

1286
01:27:31,746 --> 01:27:32,913
Sit down, Victor.

1287
01:27:34,047 --> 01:27:35,148
You okay?

1288
01:27:41,889 --> 01:27:42,923
Listen...

1289
01:27:44,792 --> 01:27:46,561
there's no easy way
to tell you this...

1290
01:27:47,828 --> 01:27:49,297
so I'm just gonna say it.

1291
01:27:50,597 --> 01:27:51,698
Your friend...

1292
01:27:56,770 --> 01:27:58,072
someone hurt her.

1293
01:27:59,573 --> 01:28:00,708
What?

1294
01:28:01,007 --> 01:28:04,112
They found her body
behind the... train station.

1295
01:28:05,378 --> 01:28:07,914
You understand
what that means, her body?

1296
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:14,922
Are they sure that it was her?

1297
01:28:16,856 --> 01:28:17,958
They know.

1298
01:31:22,943 --> 01:31:24,979
Any idea who'd do
something like that, Freddy?

1299
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:28,649
No, you hang out
with strange people like that,

1300
01:31:29,483 --> 01:31:30,685
shit I see every day.

1301
01:31:31,885 --> 01:31:33,855
Shanked, parents wanted
nothing to do with her.

1302
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:35,489
Hey Jimmy,

1303
01:31:36,423 --> 01:31:37,890
how's Victor taking all this?

1304
01:31:38,190 --> 01:31:39,292
Is he holding up?

1305
01:31:40,460 --> 01:31:41,462
Not well...

1306
01:31:42,162 --> 01:31:43,331
he's, uh...

1307
01:31:45,099 --> 01:31:46,367
just said it's an act of God.

1308
01:31:49,770 --> 01:31:51,805
Maybe someone
should go check on him.

1309
01:31:52,105 --> 01:31:53,873
I'm gonna take him out
to Doodle Eve's today,

1310
01:31:54,207 --> 01:31:55,809
get his mind off things.

1311
01:31:56,909 --> 01:31:58,011
That poor girl.

1312
01:31:59,579 --> 01:32:01,548
Every time I think
about being mean to her...

1313
01:32:03,350 --> 01:32:04,886
Never even knew her name.

1314
01:32:08,322 --> 01:32:09,489
Judge ye not.

1315
01:34:16,617 --> 01:34:17,618
Careful, Vic.

1316
01:34:36,336 --> 01:34:37,570
What's on your mind, Victor?

1317
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:43,877
You know you can talk to me
about anything, don't you, Vic?

1318
01:34:45,546 --> 01:34:46,579
I mean, we're brothers, right?

1319
01:34:50,617 --> 01:34:52,319
That night
you didn't come home...

1320
01:34:54,954 --> 01:34:56,256
and we lost our money?

1321
01:35:00,793 --> 01:35:01,996
Yeah, I remember.

1322
01:35:05,698 --> 01:35:07,367
You wasn't with Patti.

1323
01:35:11,938 --> 01:35:12,873
No...

1324
01:35:14,006 --> 01:35:15,341
I wasn't with Patti.

1325
01:35:24,350 --> 01:35:25,585
I'm sorry, Victor.

1326
01:35:40,567 --> 01:35:42,733
It wasn't enough that you tried

1327
01:35:42,735 --> 01:35:44,237
to take Patti away from Freddy?

1328
01:35:45,271 --> 01:35:47,742
It wasn't enough that
you're the handsome brother?

1329
01:35:48,608 --> 01:35:50,578
That you are the smart brother?

1330
01:35:51,878 --> 01:35:53,745
It wasn't enough
that you are the brother

1331
01:35:53,747 --> 01:35:55,783
I almost died for that day?

1332
01:36:13,198 --> 01:36:15,167
I know I'm different, Jimmy.

1333
01:36:16,269 --> 01:36:18,606
I know that I'm what
people call stupid...

1334
01:36:22,609 --> 01:36:25,646
but sometimes people don't know
that I know that.

1335
01:36:28,114 --> 01:36:30,915
But I'm smart enough
not to have thought

1336
01:36:30,917 --> 01:36:32,152
that a girl like that...

1337
01:36:34,854 --> 01:36:37,691
would ever fall in love
with someone like me.

1338
01:36:41,493 --> 01:36:44,164
I know what a lummox is, Jimmy.

1339
01:36:45,465 --> 01:36:47,168
I know that I am one.

1340
01:36:49,970 --> 01:36:52,338
It was just nice
that someone like her

1341
01:36:52,905 --> 01:36:54,608
didn't treat me like one.

1342
01:36:58,511 --> 01:36:59,646
I, uh...

1343
01:37:02,949 --> 01:37:05,185
I guess I never really talked
about it with you...

1344
01:37:06,118 --> 01:37:07,320
like we should've.

1345
01:37:09,323 --> 01:37:10,691
Like brothers should've.

1346
01:37:30,277 --> 01:37:32,046
I miss Grandma, Jimmy.

1347
01:37:35,015 --> 01:37:36,517
She was good to us.

1348
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:42,256
She wasn't nothing,
but a little old lady, but...

1349
01:37:43,523 --> 01:37:45,926
when she died
I didn't feel safe no more.

1350
01:37:48,828 --> 01:37:49,730
Sometimes...

1351
01:37:52,666 --> 01:37:54,702
I wish I could
un-ring that bell.

1352
01:38:31,136 --> 01:38:32,773
Sorry I haven't been
a good brother to you...

1353
01:38:35,408 --> 01:38:36,844
but I tried, Vic.

1354
01:38:39,345 --> 01:38:40,747
I really tried.

1355
01:38:56,095 --> 01:38:59,500
Only the mediocre
are always at their best.

1356
01:39:18,917 --> 01:39:20,550
Oh, be careful, Jimmy.

1357
01:39:44,644 --> 01:39:46,213
- Hiya, Leo.
- Vic.

1358
01:39:57,323 --> 01:40:01,362
Hey, Leo, you getting
any Hank Snow records in?

1359
01:40:02,095 --> 01:40:03,063
Yeah.

1360
01:40:05,532 --> 01:40:06,467
What?

1361
01:40:07,801 --> 01:40:11,102
It's an import from Japan,
promotional picture disc,

1362
01:40:11,104 --> 01:40:14,072
it's got ol' Hank burned
right there into the hot wax.

1363
01:40:14,439 --> 01:40:16,141
Would you like to hold it maybe?

1364
01:40:16,842 --> 01:40:18,811
Gotta be
real careful though, okay?

1365
01:40:19,779 --> 01:40:23,179
That there's the holy shit,
Holy Grail of all Hank vinyl,

1366
01:40:23,181 --> 01:40:25,485
very, very rare.

1367
01:40:25,853 --> 01:40:27,855
- How much?
- Phew.

1368
01:40:30,422 --> 01:40:31,692
It's on me, Vic.

1369
01:40:33,426 --> 01:40:34,427
Thank you, Leo.

1370
01:40:34,926 --> 01:40:36,162
Who gives you joy?

1371
01:40:37,430 --> 01:40:38,798
- You.
- Who?

1372
01:40:39,298 --> 01:40:40,900
- You do, Leo.
- Thank you.

1373
01:40:41,301 --> 01:40:43,470
Okay, get outta here,
go listen to your record.

1374
01:40:46,639 --> 01:40:48,542
- See ya', Leo.
- Okay.

1375
