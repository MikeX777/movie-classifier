1
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,720
Mutation--
it is the key to our evolution.

2
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,840
It has enabled us to evolve
from a single-celled organism...

3
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,280
into the dominant species on the planet.

4
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,560
This process is slow and normally taking
thousands and thousands of years.

5
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,520
But every few hundred millennia,
evolution leaps forward.

6
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,320
Niagara Falls. Up...

7
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,440
the Canadian Rockies, and then it's
only a few hundred miles to Anchorage.

8
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,480
Well, won't it be kind of cold?

9
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,400
Well, that's the point, stupid.

10
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,640
Otherwise, it wouldn't be an adventure.

11
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,200
And when are you gonna do this?

12
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,920
I don't know.

13
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,200
After high school. Before college.

14
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,280
- Marie! David?
- I don't know what happened to him.

15
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,600
I don't know what--
I just touched him.

16
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,680
I didn't--
I didn't mean--

17
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,680
- Call an ambulance!
- Don't touch.

18
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,640
- Honey--    -Just get away from me!
- Call an ambulance!

19
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,880
Don't touch me!

20
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,000
- Don't touch me.
- Ladies and gentlemen,

21
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,880
we are now seeing the beginnings
of another stage of human evolution.

22
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,720
These mutations manifest at puberty...

23
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,680
and are often triggered by periods
of heightened emotional stress.

24
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,320
Thank you, Ms. Grey.
It was quite educational.

25
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,760
However, it fails toad dress the issue
that is the focus of this hearing.

26
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,320
Three words: "Are mutants dangerous?"

27
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,200
I'm afraid that's
an unfair question, Senator Kelly.

28
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,000
After all, the wrong person behind
the wheel of a car can be dangerous.

29
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,960
Well, we do license
people to drive.

30
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,840
Yes, but not to live.
Senator, it is a fact...

31
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,200
that mutants who have come forward
and revealed themselves publicly...

32
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,840
have been met with fear,
hostility, even violence.

33
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,280
It is because of that
ever-present hostility...

34
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,760
that I am urging the Senate to vote
against mutant registration.

35
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,800
- To force mutants to expose themselves will only further--
- Expose themselves?

36
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,360
What is it the mutant community
has to hide I wonder...

37
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,440
that makes them so afraid
to identify themselves?

38
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,200
- I didn't say they were hiding.
- Let me show you what is being hidden, Ms. Grey.

39
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,840
I have here a list of names
of identified mutants...

40
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,800
living right here
in the United States.

41
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,400
- Senator Kelly--
- Now, here's a girl in Illinois
who can walk through walls.

42
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,680
Now, what's to stop her
from walking into a bank vault...

43
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,720
or into the White House
or into their houses?

44
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,960
- Senator Kelly--
- And there are even rumors, Ms. Grey,

45
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,880
of mutants so powerful that they can enter
our minds and control our thoughts,

46
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,640
taking our God-given free will.

47
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,720
I think the American people
deserve the right to decide...

48
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,480
whether they want their children
to be in school with mutants,

49
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,360
to be taught by mutants.

50
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,800
Ladies and gentlemen,

51
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,880
the truth is that mutants are very real,

52
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,760
and they are among us.

53
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,360
- We must know who they are,
- That's right!

54
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,280
and, above all, we must know...

55
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,440
what they can do.

56
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,960
Eric.

57
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,680
- What are you doing here?
- Why do you ask questions...

58
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,720
to which you already
know the answers?

59
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,800
Don't give up on them, Eric.

60
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,160
What would you have me do, Charles?
I've heard these arguments before.

61
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,200
It was a long time ago.

62
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,440
Mankind has evolved since then.

63
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,880
Yes,

64
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,960
into us.

65
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,880
You sneaking around in here, Charles?

66
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,440
Whatever are you looking for?

67
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,560
I'm looking for hope.

68
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,920
I will bring you hope, old friend.

69
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,680
And I ask only one thing in return.

70
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,400
Don't get in my way.

71
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,520
We are the future, Charles, not them.

72
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,600
They no longer matter.

73
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,880
This is it.

74
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,920
Where are we?

75
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,840
I thought you said you were gonna
take me as far as Laughlin City.

76
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,800
This is Laughlin City.

77
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,720
Gentlemen, in all my years,

78
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,840
I've never seen anything like that.

79
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,800
Are you gonna let this man
walk away with your money?

80
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
I'll fight him!

81
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,320
Ladies and gentlemen, our savior!

82
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,680
Whatever you do,
don't hit him in the balls.

83
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,520
- You said anything goes.
- Anything goes, but he'll take it personal.

84
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,120
Ladies and gentlemen,

85
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,000
tonight's winner
and still king of the cage,

86
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,960
the Wolverine!

87
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,200
You want something new, honey?

88
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,200
Or are you sticking with water?

89
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,560
I'll have a beer.

90
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:55,000
Ellis Island, once the arrival point
for thousands of American immigrants...

91
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,920
is opening its doors again.

92
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,760
Preparations are nearly completed for
the upcoming United Nations world summit.

93
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,760
With nearly every invitation confirmed,

94
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:07,800
the event promises to be the largest
single gathering of world leaders in history.

95
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,240
The leaders of over 200 nations will discuss
issues ranging from the world's economic climate...

96
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,800
and weapons treaties to the mutant phenomenon
and its impact on our world stage.

97
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,760
Many American legislators have contended...

98
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,800
that debate over mutant issues should be
the primary focus of what is, on the surface,

99
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,720
a strictly diplomatic affair.

100
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,680
- You owe me some money.
- Come on, Stu. Let's not do this.

101
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,960
No man takes a beating like that
without am ark to show for it.

102
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,520
Come on, buddy.
This isn't gonna be worth it.

103
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,520
- I know what you are.   - You lost your money.
Keep this up, you'll lose something else.

104
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,120
Come on, buddy.

105
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,280
Look out!

106
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,320
Get out of my bar, freak.

107
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,600
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm sorry. I needed a ride.

108
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,400
- Thought you might help me.
- Get out.

109
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,000
- Where am Is up posed to go?
- I don't know.

110
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,480
- You don't know or you don't care?
- Pick one.

111
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,280
- I saved your life.
- No, you didn't.

112
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,320
You don't have anything to eat, do you?

113
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,480
I'm Rogue.

114
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,800
Were you in the army?

115
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,480
Doesn't that mean you were in the army?

116
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,280
- Wow.
- What?

117
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,680
- Suddenly my life doesn't look that bad.
- If you'd prefer the road--

118
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,400
No. No. It looks great.

119
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,600
Looks cozy.

120
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,960
Put your hands on the heater.

121
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,320
I'm not gonna hurt you, kid.

122
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,000
It's nothing personal. It's just that...

123
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,120
when people touch my skin, something happens.

124
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,760
- What?
- I don't know.

125
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,120
They just get hurt.

126
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,400
Fair enough.

127
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,320
When they come out, does it hurt?

128
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,120
Every time.

129
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,720
So, what kind of a name is Rogue?

130
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,000
I don't know. What kind of a name is Wolverine?

131
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,760
My name's Logan.

132
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,560
Marie.

133
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,360
You know, you should wear your seat belt.

134
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,480
Look, kid. I don't need advice
on auto safety from--

135
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,360
You all right?

136
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,280
- Kid, are you all right?
- I'm stuck!

137
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:14,600
Weren't you supposed
to bring someone back with you?

138
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,840
- What happened?
- They knew.

139
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,160
Charles.

140
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,360
Hmm.

141
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,760
- Where is the mutant now?
- With them.

142
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,880
I have made the first move.

143
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,640
That is all they know.

144
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,480
Come. The U.N. summit is approaching.

145
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,560
Time for our little test.

146
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,200
Where's he going?

147
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,560
Where are you going?

148
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,960
Over here.

149
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,280
Where are you going?
This way.

150
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,200
He's overt here.

151
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,120
- Let's go.
- What's your hurry?

152
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,280
Good morning, Logan.

153
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,000
I'd like your definitions of weak
and strong anthropic principles...

154
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
on my desk on Wednesday.

155
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,920
That'll be all.

156
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,280
- Bye, Professor.
- Bye, Kitty.

157
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,880
Physics.

158
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,320
I'm Charles Xavier.
Would you like some breakfast?

159
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:25,480
- Where am I?
- Westchester, New York.

160
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,560
You were attacked. My people
brought you here for medical attention.

161
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,680
- I don't need medical attention.
- Yes, of course.

162
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,560
- Where's the girl?
- Rogue? She's here. She's fine.

163
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,200
Really.

164
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,920
Ah, Logan, I'd like you to meet
Ororo Monroe, also called Storm.

165
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,000
- This is Scott Summers, also called Cyclops.
- Hello.

166
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,800
They saved your life.

167
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,480
I believe you've already met Dr. Jean Grey.

168
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,520
You're in my school fort he gifted. For mutants.

169
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,960
- You'll be safe here from Magneto.
- What's a Magneto?

170
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,520
A very powerful mutant
who believes that a war is brewing...

171
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,320
between mutants and the rest of humanity.

172
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,240
I've been following his activities for some time.

173
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,000
The man who attacked you is an associate
of his called Sabretooth.

174
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,960
Sabretooth?

175
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,520
Storm.

176
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,120
What do they call you? "Wheels?"

177
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,960
This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

178
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:36,400
Cyclops, right? You wanna get out of my way?

179
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,760
Logan, it's been almost 15years, hasn't it?

180
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,440
Living from day to day,
moving from place to place,

181
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,480
with no memory of who or what you are.

182
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,400
Shut up.

183
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,400
Give me a chance.

184
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,800
I may be able to help you find some answers.

185
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,120
How do you know?

186
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,280
You're not the only one with gifts.

187
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,200
- Where are you going?
- Where's he going?

188
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,720
What are you doing there?

189
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,400
What is this place?

190
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,960
Anonymity is a mutant's first chance...

191
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,920
against the world's hostility.

192
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,760
Hey, no powers!

193
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,520
To the public, we're merely
a school for gifted youngsters.

194
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,360
Cyclops, Storm and Jean
were some of my first students.

195
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,520
I protected them, taught them
to control their powers...

196
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,680
and in time, teach others to do the same.

197
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,680
The students are mostly run a ways.

198
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,720
Frightened, alone.

199
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,320
Some with gifts so extreme
that they've become a danger...

200
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,560
to themselves and those around them.

201
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,000
Like your friend, Rogue.

202
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,960
Incapable of physical human contact,
probably fort he rest of her life,

203
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,560
and yet here she is with others her own age,

204
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,960
learning being accepted, not feared.

205
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,640
-John.
- Sorry.

206
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,400
I'm Bobby. What's your name?

207
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,400
- Rogue.
- What'll happen to her?

208
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,280
Well, that's up to her. Rejoin the world
as an educated young woman...

209
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,200
or stay on to teach others...

210
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,000
to become what the children
have affectionately called X-Men.

211
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,960
Welcome to Mutant High.

212
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,640
But the school is merely a public face.

213
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,560
The lower levels, however, are
an entirely different matter.

214
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:49,800
When I was a boy, I discovered I had
the power to control people's minds,

215
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,960
make them think or do whatever I wanted.

216
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,400
When I was 17,
I met a young man named Eric Lensherr.

217
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,240
He, too, had an unusual power.

218
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,160
He could create magnetic fields
and control metal.

219
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,320
Believing that humanity would never accept us,

220
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,440
he grew angry and vengeful.

221
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,600
He became Magneto.

222
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,680
There are mutants out there
with incredible powers, Logan,

223
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,280
and many who do not share
my respect for mankind.

224
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:23,600
If no one is equipped to oppose them,
humanity's days could be over.

225
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,720
I'll make a deal with you, Logan.

226
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,640
Give me 48 hours to find out
what Magneto wants with you,

227
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,720
and I give you my word
that I will use all my power...

228
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,400
to help you piece together
what you've lost...

229
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,840
and what you're looking for.

230
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,440
Senator, listen,
you favor gun registration, yes?

231
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,480
Well, some of these
so-called children...

232
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,880
possess more than ten times
the destructive force of any handgun.

233
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,520
No, I don't see a difference.
All I see are weapons in our schools.

234
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,360
Well, that's fair enough. All right.

235
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,480
So?

236
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,640
It's gonna be close.
A vote this loaded is always close.

237
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,800
What about the U.N. summit?
The whole world will be watching.

238
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,240
Maybe there's some way
you could use that toy our advantage.

239
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,200
We're Americans, Henry.

240
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,840
Let the rest of the damn world deal
with mutants in their own way.

241
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,240
You know this situation?

242
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,680
These mutants?

243
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,720
People like this Jean Grey?

244
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,360
If it were up to me,
I'd lock'em all away.

245
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:53,560
It's a war.
It's the reason people like me exist.

246
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,400
Where the hell are we?

247
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,800
Pilot!

248
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,760
People like you are the reason
I was afraid to go to school as a child.

249
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,560
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

250
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,840
If I hurt you.

251
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,760
So, couldn't wait to get
my shirt off again, huh?

252
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,480
The metal is an alloy called domatium.

253
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:35,400
Supposedly indestructible. It's been
surgically grafted to his entire skeleton.

254
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,320
How could he have survived
a procedure like that?

255
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,120
His mutation. He has uncharted
regenerative capability,

256
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,000
which enables him
to heal rapidly.

257
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,720
This also makes his age
impossible to determine.

258
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,320
He could very well
be older than you, Professor.

259
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,320
- Who did this to him?
- He doesn't know.

260
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,800
Nor does he remember anything
about his life before it happened.

261
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,400
Experimentation on mutants.

262
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,440
It's not unheard of.

263
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,640
But I've never seen
anything like this before.

264
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,520
What do you think
Magneto wants with him?

265
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:13,240
I'm not entirely sure
it's him Magneto wants.

266
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,920
Yech!

267
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,440
Toad has a wicked tongue, Senator.

268
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,840
Just like you.

269
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,000
Who are you people?
Where's Henry?

270
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,520
Mr. Guy rich has been dead
for some time, Senator.

271
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,280
But I've had Mystique here
keep you company.

272
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,200
She takes so many shapes.

273
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,720
Whatever you do to me,
you'll make me right.

274
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,520
Every word I've spoken
will be confirmed.

275
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,600
Are you a God-fearing man, Senator?

276
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,560
That's such a strange phrase.

277
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,280
I've always thought
of God as a teacher,

278
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,720
as a bringer of light,
wisdom and understanding.

279
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:25,280
You see, I think
what you really are afraid of is me.

280
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,360
Me and my kind.
The Brotherhood of Mutants.

281
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,400
Though it's not
so surprising, really.

282
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:37,440
Mankind has always feared
what it doesn't understand.

283
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,920
Well, don't fear God, Senator,

284
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,840
and certainly, don't fear me.

285
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,800
Not anymore.

286
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,760
What do you intend to do to me?

287
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:54,120
Let's just say God works too slowly.

288
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,760
I think you'll be comfortable here.

289
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,920
- Where is your room?
- With Scott down the hall.

290
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,560
Is that your gift?
Putting up with that guy?

291
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,120
Actually, I'm telekinetic.
I can move things with my mind.

292
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,240
Really? What kinds of things?

293
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,440
All kinds of things.

294
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,200
I also have some telepathic ability.

295
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,560
- What, like your Professor?
- Nowhere near that powerful.

296
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,320
But he's teaching me to develop it.

297
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,240
I'm sure he is.

298
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,400
- So read my mind.
- I'd rather not.

299
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,880
Come on. You afraid you might like it?

300
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,760
I doubt it.

301
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,480
What do you see?

302
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,240
Scott.

303
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,240
Good night, Logan.

304
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,640
You gonna tell me
to stay away from your girl?

305
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,880
If I had to do that,
she wouldn't be my girl.

306
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,400
Hmm. Well, then, I guess
you've got nothing to worry about,

307
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,320
do you, Cyclops?

308
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,560
Yeah, it must just burn you up that
a boy like me saved your life, huh?

309
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,000
You ought to be careful.
I might not be there next time.

310
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,800
Oh, and, Logan,

311
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,600
stay away from my girl.

312
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,880
Logan.

313
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,600
Logan. Logan, wake up.

314
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,480
Help me.

315
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,800
Somebody help!

316
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,640
Scott, grab a pillow.

317
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,440
It was an accident.

318
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,160
- Logan?
- What happened?

319
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,960
- Is she all right?
- She'll be all right.

320
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,880
What did she do to me?

321
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,640
Whenever Rogue touches someone, she
takes their energy, their life force.

322
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,480
In the case of mutants, she absorbs
their gifts for a short while.

323
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,920
In your case, your ability to heal.

324
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,120
I feel like she almost killed me.

325
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:25,240
If she'd held out any longer,
she could have.

326
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,560
How are we feeling, Senator?
Advanced, I hope.

327
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,240
Hmm.

328
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,760
What the hell
have you done to me?

329
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,720
Senator, this is pointless.
Where would you go?

330
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,280
Who would take you in
now that you're one of us?

331
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,920
Tommy, let it go!
Tommy, please let it go!

332
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,840
I'm telling Mommy.

333
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,200
Is that a mutant?

334
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,960
...of this week's U.N. summit.

335
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,400
With the leaders
of over200nations attending,

336
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,280
the secret service
has transformed Ellis Island...

337
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,680
into a veritable Fort Knox
for tomorrow night's opening gala.

338
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,280
Ellis Island rests less than one mile
from the shores of Manhattan.

339
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,560
Rogue.

340
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,360
- Bobby.
- Rogue, what did you do?

341
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,640
They say that you're
stealing other mutants' powers.

342
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,640
No, no.
I borrowed his powers.

343
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,840
You never use your power
against another mutant.

344
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,200
I had no choice.

345
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,280
- No, you have to understand me.
- If I were you,

346
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,680
I'd get myself out of here.

347
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,720
- What do you mean?
- Listen, the students are freaked.

348
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,640
Professor Xavier's furious.
I don't know what he'll do with you.

349
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,680
I think it'll be easier
on your own.

350
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,520
You should go.

351
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,720
What are you looking for, Eric?

352
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:39,480
It's strange. There are
more powerful mutants out there.

353
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,640
Why should this one
be so important to him?

354
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:44,000
- Maybe it's his way with people.
- You don't like him.

355
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,800
- How could you tell?
- Well, I am psychic, you know.

356
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,000
- Where is she?
- Who?

357
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,920
Rogue.

358
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,920
She's gone.

359
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,720
Welcome, Professor.

360
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,640
Welcome to Cerebro.

361
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,480
This certainly is a big, round room.

362
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:19,000
The brain waves of mutants
are different from average human beings.

363
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,960
This device amplifies my power,

364
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,640
allowing me to locate mutants
across great distances.

365
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,560
That's how I intend to find Rogue.

366
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,440
- Why don't you just use it to find Magneto?
- I've been trying.

367
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,800
But he seems to have found
some way to shield himself from it.

368
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:36,240
How would he know how to do that?

369
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,240
Because he helped me build it.

370
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,720
Now, if you'll excuse me.

371
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,640
Have you ever--

372
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,880
Used Cerebro?

373
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:01,320
No. It takes a degree of control,

374
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,920
and, uh, for someone like me, it's--

375
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,800
Dangerous.

376
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:45,800
...now boarding on track four.

377
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,880
- She's at the train station.
- Where is it?

378
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:55,120
A few miles west of here.
Logan, you can't leave the mansion.

379
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:59,280
- It's just the opportunity Magneto needs.
- I'm the reason she took off.

380
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,360
- We had a deal.
- She's all right. She's just upset.

381
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,600
Storm, Cyclops, find her.
See if you can talk to her.

382
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,680
- What?
- Where's my motorcycle?

383
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,000
Hey, kid.

384
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,960
I'm sorry about last night.

385
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,280
Me too.

386
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:22,320
- You running again?
- I heard the professor was mad at me.

387
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:26,400
- Well, who told you that?
- A boy at school.

388
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,720
- When's the last time you saw her?
- She was supposed to meet me for lunch.

389
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:38,800
You look around.
I'll check with the ticket agent.

390
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,880
Welcome, Professor.

391
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,880
- You think I should go back.
- No, I think you should follow your instincts.

392
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,120
The first boy I ever kissed...

393
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:32,560
ended up in a coma for three weeks.

394
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,160
I can still feel him inside my head.

395
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,720
And it's the same with you.

396
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:11,480
There's not many people that'll
understand what you're going through,

397
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:15,560
but I think this guy's
Xavier's one of them.

398
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:18,800
He seems to genuinely wanna help you,

399
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,800
and that's a rare thing...

400
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,760
for people like us.

401
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,000
So, what do you say?

402
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,200
Give these geeks one more shot?

403
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,560
Come on. I'll take care of you.

404
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,960
- You promise?
- Yeah.

405
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,920
Yeah, I promise.

406
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,480
Come along now.

407
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:11,600
She's about 17. Uh, my height.

408
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,680
Has brown hair, and she--

409
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:23,680
Scream for me.

410
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,600
Quit playing around.

411
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,560
You must be Wolverine.

412
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,760
That remarkable metal doesn't run
through your entire body, does it?

413
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,640
Stop! Stop it!

414
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:14,520
What the hell do you want with me?

415
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:18,640
You? My dear boy,
whoever said I wanted you?

416
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,200
Young people.

417
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,560
All right, hold it.
Hold it right there.

418
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:57,560
Stay where you are.
Put your hands over your heads now.

419
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,120
You Homo sapiens and your guns.

420
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,160
- That's enough, Eric.
- Let them go.

421
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,400
Why not come out where
I can see you, Charles?

422
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,280
- What do you--
- Want her for?

423
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:55,800
Can't you read my mind?

424
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:00,400
What now? Save the girl?

425
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:04,480
You'll have to kill me, Charles.
And what will that accomplish?

426
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,280
Let them pass that law. They'll have you in
chains with a number burned into your forehead.

427
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,440
- It won't be--
- That way.

428
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,600
Then kill me and find out.

429
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,120
Huh? Then release me.

430
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,880
Fine.

431
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,600
Care to press your luck, Charles?

432
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,520
I don't think I can stop them all.

433
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,240
Still unwilling
to make sacrifices.

434
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,280
That's what makes you weak.

435
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:23,000
Good-bye, Charles.

436
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:55,800
- You said he wanted me.
- I made a terrible mistake.

437
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:58,520
His helmet was somehow designed
to block my telepathy.

438
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:03,280
I couldn't see what
he was after till it was too late.

439
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,360
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna find her.

440
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:08,440
- How?
- The traditional way. Look.

441
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:14,400
Logan, you can't do this alone.

442
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:17,000
Who's gonna help me? You?
So far you've all done a bang-up job.

443
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,240
Then help us. Fight with us.

444
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:21,920
Fight with you?
What, join the team? Be an X-Man?

445
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,640
Who the hell do you think you are?
You're a mutant.

446
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:27,640
The whole world out there is full
of people that hate and fear you.

447
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:31,280
And you're wasting your time trying to
protected? I got better things to do.

448
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:35,640
You know, Magneto's right.
There's a war coming.

449
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:39,760
- You sure you're on the right side?
- At least I've chosen a side.

450
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:50,680
I'm looking for Dr. Jean Grey.

451
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,320
Senator Kelly.

452
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,640
I'm Professor Charles Xavier.

453
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:09,480
I was afraid if I went
to a hospital, they would--

454
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,480
Treat you like a mutant?

455
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:17,240
We're not what you think. Not all of us.

456
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:21,000
Tell it to the ones who did this to me.

457
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,120
Senator...

458
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:34,920
I want you to try and relax.

459
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,640
I'm not going to hurt you.

460
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,720
Welcome to the future,

461
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:34,640
brother.

462
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:44,520
The machine emits radiation that triggers
mutation in ordinary human beings.

463
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:46,600
But the mutation is unnatural.

464
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,200
Kelly's body is rejecting it.
His cells began...

465
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,480
to break down almost immediately.

466
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:54,320
- What effect does radiation have on mutants?
- There appears to be none.

467
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:58,800
But I fear it will seriously
harm any normal person exposed to it.

468
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:01,880
- So what does Magneto want with Rogue?
- I don't know.

469
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,320
Wait a second.

470
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:09,400
You said this machine
draws its power from Magneto...

471
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,800
-and that it weakened him.
- Yes.

472
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:15,800
In fact, it nearly killed him.

473
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,680
He's gonna transfer his power to Rogue...

474
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:20,840
and use her to power the machine.

475
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,440
Is somebody there?

476
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:30,800
Yes. I'm here.

477
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:34,800
Please don't leave me.

478
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:38,280
Don't want to be alone.

479
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,680
All right.

480
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:53,240
Do you hate normal people?

481
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:57,920
Sometimes.

482
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,840
Why?

483
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,320
I suppose...

484
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:09,000
I'm afraid of them.

485
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,120
Well,

486
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:16,920
I think you've got one less person to--

487
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,840
to be afraid of.

488
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,640
Cyclops, you and Storm ready the jet.
I'm gonna find Rogue.

489
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,720
-Jean, get Logan a uniform.
- Whoa, wait a minute.

490
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:49,640
- He's not coming with us, is he?
- Yes.

491
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:52,320
I'm sorry, Professor, but he'll
endanger the mission. And if--

492
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:55,440
Hey, I wasn't the one who gave
the train station a new sun roof, pal.

493
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,720
- No, you were the one who stabbed
Rogue through the chest.     - Scott--

494
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:01,400
Hey, why don't you take your
little mission and stick it up your--

495
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,280
Senator Kelly is dead.

496
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:07,000
I'm going to find her.

497
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,800
Settle this.

498
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,840
I'm sorry.

499
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:15,120
You cans till hear me, can't you?

500
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:27,480
You've taught me everything in my life
that was ever worth knowing.

501
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:30,720
And if anything happens,

502
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,920
well, I'll take care of them.

503
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:48,680
Jean?

504
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:54,240
Jean!

505
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,520
No!

506
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:10,680
Jean?

507
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:12,600
Jean.

508
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:14,920
Answer me. Please.

509
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:18,400
I know where Magneto's going.

510
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:36,640
Magnificent, isn't she?

511
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:42,360
- I've seen it.
- I first saw her in 1 949.

512
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:45,800
America was gonna be
the land of tolerance,

513
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:47,720
of peace.

514
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,400
Are you going to kill me?

515
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,920
- Yes.
- Why?

516
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:06,800
Because there is no land of tolerance.
There is nope ace.

517
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:08,800
Not here or anywhere else.

518
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:12,560
Women and children,
whole families destroyed...

519
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:15,320
simply because they were born different
from those in power.

520
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:20,400
Well, after tonight, the world's
powerful will be just like us.

521
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:23,400
They will return home as brothers.

522
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:25,480
As mutants.

523
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:27,960
Our cause will be theirs.

524
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:32,000
Your sacrifice will mean our survival.

525
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:38,840
I'll understand if that
comes as small consolation.

526
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:44,320
Put her in the machine.

527
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:47,360
I'll raise it.

528
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:52,400
Magneto is here. Liberty Island.

529
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:55,360
Now, presumably, his objective is to mutate
the world leaders at the U.N. summit...

530
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:57,400
on Ellis Island.

531
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:59,560
He doesn't know his machine kills.

532
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:03,800
And judging from what the Professor saw,
if Magneto gave Rogue enough power--

533
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:07,200
He could wipe out everyone
in New York City.

534
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:10,320
We can insert here
at the George Washington Bridge,

535
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:12,640
come around the bank
just off of Manhattan.

536
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:16,120
We land on the far side
of Liberty Island here.

537
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:18,800
What about harbor patrol? Radar?

538
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:20,920
If they have anything that can pick up
our jet, they deserve to catch us.

539
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:38,680
You actually go outside in these things?

540
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:41,400
Well, what would you prefer,
yellow spandex?

541
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:49,960
Whoa!

542
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:32,840
Okay, there's the bridge.
I'm taking her down.

543
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,440
Storm, some cover,
please.

544
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:02,840
Toad, Mystique, stays harp.
We're not alone.

545
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:04,760
And you stay here.

546
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:08,440
Once I give my power to the girl,
I'll be temporarily weakened.

547
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:10,440
You'll be
my only defense.

548
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:19,560
Sounds like
a storm's coming.

549
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:36,720
- Sorry.
- You call that a landing?

550
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,840
The torch.

551
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,720
...within a mile oft he proceedings.

552
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:02,440
The first dignitaries
started to arrive about an hour ago,

553
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:04,760
greeted with a sort
of garden-party atmosphere,

554
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:06,720
which was designed
to entertain them,

555
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:09,600
as the others
traversed the rigid security.

556
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:36,600
- There's someone here.
- Where?

557
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:39,880
- I don't know. Keep your eye open.
- Logan.

558
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:45,240
Damn it.

559
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:53,280
- Anything?
- I know there's someone here. I just can't esteem.

560
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:09,120
- Wait!
- Wait!

561
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:17,440
All right, back up. Back up.

562
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:31,320
Jean!

563
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:34,600
Oh, God.

564
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,760
Don't move.

565
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:52,120
Don't you people ever die?

566
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:28,280
Do you know what happens to a toad
when it's struck by lightning?

567
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,800
Same thing that happens
to everything else.

568
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:53,680
Logan, is that you?

569
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:55,600
Shh.

570
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,000
The other one ain't far away.

571
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,480
Come on. We have to regroup.

572
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,400
I know, but there's a problem.

573
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:17,680
You're not part of the group.

574
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,360
Hey, hey, it's me.

575
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:42,680
- Prove it.
- You're a dick.

576
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,680
Okay.

577
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:49,840
Hey.

578
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,240
Everybody get out of here.

579
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:11,240
- What is it?
- I can't move.

580
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:33,480
Ah, my brothers.

581
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:36,520
Welcome. And, you,

582
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:39,480
just point those claws of yours
in a safer direction.

583
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,920
You'd better close your eyes.

584
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:00,120
- Storm, fry him.
- Oh, yes.

585
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:04,880
A bolt of lightning into
a huge copper conductor.

586
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:06,880
I thought you lived at a school.

587
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:15,160
For those of you who may not be familiar
with the historical significance--

588
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,840
Mystique?

589
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:24,920
- Mystique?
- I've seen Senator Kelly.

590
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:30,240
So the good senator survived his fall...

591
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:32,600
and the swim to shore.

592
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:34,800
He's become even more powerful
than I could have imagined.

593
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:37,480
- He's dead.
- It's true.

594
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:41,880
Is a whim die.
Like those people down there will die.

595
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:45,440
Are you sure you saw what you saw?

596
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:49,680
I would also like to thank
the president of the United States...

597
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:51,920
for hosting this event...

598
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:55,280
under the lights of
the great city of New York.

599
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:05,920
Why do none of you understand
what I'm trying to do?

600
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:11,520
Those people down there, they control our
fate and the fate of every other mutant.

601
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:15,400
Well,

602
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:17,640
soon our fate will be theirs.

603
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:20,880
Help! Please help me!

604
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,760
You're so full of shit.

605
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:26,880
If you were really so righteous,
it'd be you in that thing.

606
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:32,320
Help! Somebody help me!

607
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,400
Please!

608
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:51,280
Somebody please help me!

609
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:57,280
Somebody!

610
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:59,840
Help--

611
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,400
Logan!

612
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:08,120
- I'm sorry, my dear.
- Don't do this.

613
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:22,400
This is mine.

614
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,440
You owe me a scream.

615
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:30,200
Hey, bub. I'm not finished with you yet.

616
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:35,720
Jean.

617
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:38,120
- Scott, when I tell you, open your eyes.
- No.

618
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:40,600
- Trust me.
- You drop something?

619
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:47,000
Now.

620
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:02,520
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

621
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:06,480
We gotta get her out of there.
Cyclops, can you hit it?

622
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:09,560
- The rings are too fast. I'll kill her.
- Just shoot it.

623
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:11,880
- Storm, can you get me up there?
- I can't control it like that.

624
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:14,720
- You could fly right over the torch.
- Then let me go.

625
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:18,960
If I don't make it, then at least
you can still blast the damn thing.

626
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:22,320
All right, do it.

627
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:24,760
Jean, use your power. Try to steady him.

628
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,280
Hang on to something.

629
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,840
Scott, wait.

630
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:53,520
- I have to.
-Just wait.

631
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:57,800
I have a shot.

632
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,680
I'm taking it.

633
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:39,760
Come on.

634
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,640
Hey, this one's alive.
Let's get him out of here.

635
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:36,560
Welcome back.

636
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:39,560
I knew you'd find your way.

637
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:41,640
I had you to guide me.

638
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:45,760
How did we do?

639
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:14,720
Oh! Oh, that tickles.

640
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:17,720
Hey.

641
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:20,960
Hey.

642
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:24,160
- How're you feeling?
- Fantastic.

643
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:28,400
That was a brave thing you did.

644
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:33,200
- Did it work?
- Yeah. She's fine.

645
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:37,920
She took on a few of your more
charming personality traits for a while.

646
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:41,440
But we lived through it.

647
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:47,600
I think she's a little taken with you.

648
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:51,880
Well, you can tell her
my heart belongs to someone else.

649
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:59,760
- You know, you and I--
- How's the professor?

650
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:05,320
- He's good.
- Good.

651
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:15,360
There's an abandoned military compound
at Alkali Lake in the Canadian Rockies,

652
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:17,280
close to where we found you.

653
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:21,520
There's not much left,
but you might find some answers.

654
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:27,000
- Thank you.
- Are you going to say good-bye to them?

655
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:33,640
The Mutant Registration Act
lost its main proponent today...

656
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:36,320
with the dramatic reversal
of Senator Robert Kelly,

657
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:40,680
who until this time had provided the loudest
voice in the cry for mutant registration.

658
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:42,640
I was wrong on this particular issue.

659
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:45,960
And I hope in time I may be forgiven.
Thank you.

660
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:50,480
- The Mutant Registration Act
continues to draws up port...     - Mystique.

661
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:55,880
Son of a bitch.

662
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:57,840
from many Parents Rights groups...

663
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:01,480
who feel threatened by unidentified
mutants in their school systems.

664
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:04,800
In a related story,

665
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:08,400
the body of Senator Kelly's long time
aide, Henry Gyrich, was found today.

666
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:13,520
Preliminary coroner reports seem to indicate
that Gyrich was mauled by a bear.

667
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:15,240
Hey.

668
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:22,800
- You running again?
- No, not really.

669
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:27,440
I have some things
to take care of up north.

670
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:34,760
I kind of like it.

671
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:41,120
I don't want you to go.

672
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:55,400
I'll be back for this.

673
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:34,960
Doesn't it ever wake you
in the middle of the night?

674
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:37,800
The feeling that someday
they will pass that foolish law...

675
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:42,000
or one just like it and come for you...

676
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,840
and your children?

677
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:49,160
It does, indeed.

678
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:57,160
What do you do when
you wake up to that?

679
01:29:57,160 --> 01:30:00,240
I feel a great swell of pity
for the poor soul...

680
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:03,840
who comes to that school
looking for trouble.

681
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:14,120
Why do you come here, Charles?

682
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:17,400
Why do you ask questions
to which you already know the answers?

683
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:19,440
Oh, yes.

684
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:21,840
Your continuing search for hope.

685
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:36,560
You know this plastic prison of theirs
won't hold me forever.

686
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:41,000
The war is still coming,
Charles, and I intend to fight it...

687
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,960
by any means necessary.

688
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:48,400
And I will always be there,

689
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:50,400
old friend.
