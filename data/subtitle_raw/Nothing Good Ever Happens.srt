(train rumbling)

2
00:00:30,484 --> 00:00:32,651
- Pretty chilly out today.

3
00:00:35,029 --> 00:00:36,112
- Little bit.

4
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,317
- Could be worse.

5
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:43,960
- Could be a lot worse.

6
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,527
- You having a good day today?

7
00:00:53,527 --> 00:00:54,610
- Not so bad.

8
00:00:57,896 --> 00:00:59,479
- I can't complain.

9
00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:03,612
Nobody would listen anyhow.

10
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:07,366
(both men chuckle)

11
00:01:11,965 --> 00:01:15,132
Would you mind if I touched your face?

12
00:01:21,461 --> 00:01:22,461
- Okay.

13
00:01:22,461 --> 00:01:25,794
(police sirens blaring)

14
00:01:49,945 --> 00:01:51,695
- Thank you for that.

15
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,987
- No problem.

16
00:02:02,474 --> 00:02:05,152
- Well I gotta get going now.

17
00:02:05,152 --> 00:02:05,985
- Bye.

18
00:02:09,456 --> 00:02:11,789
(cane taps)

19
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:20,506
- Hey.

20
00:02:20,506 --> 00:02:21,339
- What?

21
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:25,818
- What the hell, I thought you were blind?

22
00:02:26,789 --> 00:02:28,456
- I never said that.

23
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,180
(car rumbles)

24
00:02:39,487 --> 00:02:43,829
♫ All of the people who
would rather be by themselves

25
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:47,996
♫ Aren't inherently unhappy ♫

26
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,214
- Sometimes I look up at
the moon, and I wonder,

27
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:54,025
is someone else looking up
at the same moon at the same

28
00:02:54,025 --> 00:02:55,108
time with me?

29
00:02:56,512 --> 00:02:59,397
And do they wish they were dead too?

30
00:02:59,397 --> 00:03:02,693
♫ Let me a few things off of my chest ♫

31
00:03:02,693 --> 00:03:04,678
I'm Neil Michael Adler.

32
00:03:04,678 --> 00:03:06,737
Where do I start?

33
00:03:06,737 --> 00:03:11,317
I'm Jewish, well, my Dad's
Jewish, so, I'm half Jewish.

34
00:03:11,317 --> 00:03:13,828
Actually to people that like
Jews I'm not, but, to people

35
00:03:13,828 --> 00:03:16,563
who hate Jews, I'm definitely Jewish.

36
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:20,730
Regardless, I'm fairly certain
that God did not choose me.

37
00:03:21,691 --> 00:03:25,625
I'm kind of sad, not really
sad, I just mean, I can be

38
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:29,221
sad at times, I've always
felt like this was my default,

39
00:03:29,221 --> 00:03:32,744
but, I look at a flower and I get sad.

40
00:03:32,744 --> 00:03:35,005
I have a great kiss and it makes me sad.

41
00:03:35,005 --> 00:03:39,794
Can't exactly tell you why,
but, this is just the way I am.

42
00:03:39,794 --> 00:03:43,839
I do enjoy life, sadness is
just kind of like a companion.

43
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:46,871
I've got my own business and I like that.

44
00:03:46,871 --> 00:03:50,121
I paint which is awful, but, I like it.

45
00:03:51,059 --> 00:03:54,736
Most importantly though, there's Amanda.

46
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:56,843
She's my little slice of Heaven.

47
00:03:56,843 --> 00:04:00,531
She keeps me honest and
makes me a better person.

48
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:03,531
With her, everything stays together.

49
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:05,966
It's almost easy.

50
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,550
I know a lot of people say
you shouldn't put all of your

51
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,784
eggs in one basket, well I'm
here to tell you, those people

52
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:12,451
have shitty baskets.

53
00:04:13,752 --> 00:04:15,669

early again so I'll just

I'm not fine, I'm not fine

♫ There are just gonna
be so many people there

80
00:05:41,395 --> 00:05:43,963
♫ And they would be happy
and they would be drunk

81
00:05:43,963 --> 00:05:48,144

86
00:06:22,527 --> 00:06:25,019
- Hey man, you doing okay?

87
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:28,374
I know it's been hard but
I got something for you.

88
00:06:28,374 --> 00:06:31,312
It'll take great care of you.

89
00:06:31,312 --> 00:06:32,483
- I don't wanna know.

90
00:06:32,483 --> 00:06:34,586
- It's home made.

91
00:06:34,586 --> 00:06:37,438
- I won't be drinking that.

92
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:40,134
- Trust me, when I fractured
my elbow I drank two glasses

93
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:42,051
and I didn't feel shit.

94
00:06:43,062 --> 00:06:46,633
- I don't want it, I'm just
gonna stay here, clean my place

95
00:06:46,633 --> 00:06:48,989
and try not to think about
it, it's what guys do.

96
00:06:48,989 --> 00:06:51,185
- So I'm gonna leave this right here.

97
00:06:51,185 --> 00:06:54,185
I care about you, stay strong angel.

100
00:07:24,805 --> 00:07:26,722

(machine beeps)

106
00:08:58,962 --> 00:09:01,129
- [Nurse] Can you hear me?

107
00:09:07,894 --> 00:09:09,477
- Yeah, where am I?

108
00:09:10,532 --> 00:09:13,749
- Daniel Madigan Memorial,
we pumped your stomach,

109
00:09:13,749 --> 00:09:15,749
you're going to be okay.

110
00:09:18,165 --> 00:09:19,444
- Bleach?

111
00:09:19,444 --> 00:09:22,090
- Yes, you drank bleach.

112
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:24,696
You slept through most
of your suicide watch,

113
00:09:24,696 --> 00:09:26,029
how do you feel?

114
00:09:27,306 --> 00:09:28,957
- It was an accident.

115
00:09:28,957 --> 00:09:30,858
- I'm sure it was.

116
00:09:30,858 --> 00:09:34,120
- God damn it, I didn't mean to.

117
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,929
- It's really up to the doctor, you know?

118
00:09:36,929 --> 00:09:39,905
Honestly you're probably looking
at court ordered therapy,

119
00:09:39,905 --> 00:09:43,893
same thing happened to my
sister's daughter, she's a mess.

120
00:09:43,893 --> 00:09:45,543
Well maybe you know her,

121
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,770
her name's,
- Can I speak to my doctor

122
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,007
please?
- Alright, but watch your tone

123
00:09:49,007 --> 00:09:53,174
unless you like your sponge
baths rough. (chuckles)

124
00:09:56,288 --> 00:09:58,946
- Ah, you woke up. (chuckles)

125
00:09:58,946 --> 00:10:01,137
So what seems to be the problem?

126
00:10:01,137 --> 00:10:04,607
- I was just trying to explain
that I didn't try to kill

127
00:10:04,607 --> 00:10:06,925
myself, it was all an accident.

128
00:10:06,925 --> 00:10:09,092
- Well, let's take a look.

129
00:10:16,478 --> 00:10:20,478
Nope, you attempted
suicide, says so right here.

130
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:25,159
(clock ticks)

131
00:10:40,983 --> 00:10:44,233
- I know you feel pressured to be here.

132
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:47,656
- Yeah, the court ordered me
to, so yeah, I'd say that's

133
00:10:47,656 --> 00:10:48,823
some pressure.

134
00:10:49,885 --> 00:10:52,494
- But I want you to open up
to me, I really know I can

135
00:10:52,494 --> 00:10:53,327
help you.

136
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:59,187
- I didn't try to kill myself.

137
00:10:59,187 --> 00:11:01,876
- So you're telling me that
the day your girlfriend of six

138
00:11:01,876 --> 00:11:05,061
years moves out, you
accidentally drink bleach after

139
00:11:05,061 --> 00:11:07,144
drinking yourself stupid?

140
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:12,677
- I thought I was drinking more alcohol.

141
00:11:12,677 --> 00:11:15,927
- What is it that makes you so ashamed?

142
00:11:18,362 --> 00:11:20,612
- That's not what happened.

143
00:11:21,838 --> 00:11:25,963
- Are you embarrassed
because you didn't succeed?

144
00:11:25,963 --> 00:11:30,301
Is it because it wasn't
a very manly way to die?

145
00:11:30,301 --> 00:11:34,708
You must have changed your
mind since you called 911.

146
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,875
Do you feel like a coward?

147
00:11:43,101 --> 00:11:44,018
- Fuck you.

148
00:11:53,424 --> 00:11:55,024
You're supposed to be there for me,

149
00:11:55,024 --> 00:11:57,691
you're supposed to be my friend.

150
00:12:00,099 --> 00:12:02,245
But you know what?

151
00:12:02,245 --> 00:12:04,055
Now you're just a fucking bummer.

152
00:12:04,055 --> 00:12:05,573
Fuck you, fuck you.

153
00:12:05,573 --> 00:12:06,406
Fuck you.

154
00:12:10,653 --> 00:12:12,590
Shouldn't we get this fire going?

155
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,090
- Absolutely, man.

156
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:17,704
(paper shuffles)

157
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:20,024
- What is that?
- That's kindling.

158
00:12:20,024 --> 00:12:22,047
- Are those letters?
- Relax, they're just

159
00:12:22,047 --> 00:12:24,275
children's letters to Santa.

160
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:25,723
- How is that any better?

161
00:12:25,723 --> 00:12:27,218
- You know there's no Santa, right?

162
00:12:27,218 --> 00:12:29,490
Nobody reads these letters.

163
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:33,126
It's fine, I already removed the stamps.

164
00:12:33,126 --> 00:12:35,312
- It's just like killing a
piece of childhood though.

165
00:12:35,312 --> 00:12:37,175
- Have you ever paid a gas bill?

166
00:12:37,175 --> 00:12:40,681
Then your childhood is dead, get over it.

167
00:12:40,681 --> 00:12:42,503
- Maybe I'll just get some
face time with Amanda.

168
00:12:42,503 --> 00:12:44,770
Maybe we can talk it out.

169
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,594
She just left out of nowhere.

170
00:12:46,594 --> 00:12:48,241
- Was it really out of nowhere?

171
00:12:48,241 --> 00:12:50,468
- Yeah dude, we were happy
and then she was just gone.

172
00:12:50,468 --> 00:12:53,285
- Did you try calling her?

173
00:12:53,285 --> 00:12:55,505
- She wouldn't answer, so I'm
just gonna have to find her

174
00:12:55,505 --> 00:12:56,755
when she's out.

175
00:12:57,892 --> 00:13:00,293
- I guess stalking is a slightly
better idea than killing

176
00:13:00,293 --> 00:13:02,626
yourself, but only slightly.

177
00:13:04,973 --> 00:13:07,902
- I make a living doing art for clients.

178
00:13:07,902 --> 00:13:09,760
It's great not having a boss.

179
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,994
Instead I have about 40 bosses.

180
00:13:12,994 --> 00:13:15,418
I always have to keep gaining new clients.

181
00:13:15,418 --> 00:13:18,201
It's a pretty simple five step process.

182
00:13:18,201 --> 00:13:20,715
Step one, look presentable.

183
00:13:20,715 --> 00:13:22,548
Step two, be prepared.

184
00:13:23,738 --> 00:13:26,501
Step three, doubt yourself.

185
00:13:26,501 --> 00:13:29,360
Step four, cheese burgers.

186
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,371
Step five, properly hide the
fact that you are just a child

187
00:13:33,371 --> 00:13:36,435
that never grew up the same
way everyone else must have.

188
00:13:36,435 --> 00:13:38,756
You must lie to this person or
persons to make them believe

189
00:13:38,756 --> 00:13:41,313
that you aren't actually two
eight year olds on each other's

190
00:13:41,313 --> 00:13:43,457
shoulders underneath a long coat.

191
00:13:43,457 --> 00:13:45,624
They must believe the lie.

192
00:13:51,721 --> 00:13:53,721
- Yeah, yeah, I like it.

193
00:13:55,241 --> 00:13:56,574
I like it a lot.

194
00:13:57,846 --> 00:13:59,876
Tell you what, though.

195
00:13:59,876 --> 00:14:04,043
I would like it more if it
was a bit more blue, yeah?

196
00:14:07,572 --> 00:14:09,794
- Okay, I mean, it is blue.

197
00:14:09,794 --> 00:14:12,408
- Yeah, but more blue, you know?

198
00:14:12,408 --> 00:14:14,054
More.

199
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:16,530
- Like a stronger blue, or a royal blue?

200
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:20,505
- Nah, no, no, different blue, you know?

201
00:14:20,505 --> 00:14:24,005
Not like royal blue, just, you know, blue.

202
00:14:28,874 --> 00:14:30,384
- Alright.

203
00:14:30,384 --> 00:14:31,884
- That make sense?

204
00:14:38,446 --> 00:14:40,491
- Hey baby.
- Hi.

205
00:14:40,491 --> 00:14:42,060
- Ready to go?
- Yeah.

206
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,227
- [Girl] Okay.

207
00:14:44,947 --> 00:14:47,469
- Are you really that surprised
that there was someone else?

208
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,546
- Yes.

209
00:14:48,546 --> 00:14:49,451
- And a chick?

210
00:14:49,451 --> 00:14:50,812
You didn't see that coming?

211
00:14:50,812 --> 00:14:53,000
- Well her Facebook did always
say that she was bisexual,

212
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,430
but I just thought she did
that to seem more likable.

213
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:59,018
- She didn't have like, jet
black hair and piercings,

214
00:14:59,018 --> 00:15:00,200
did she?

215
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,033
- Yeah.

216
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:03,685
- Dude, was it her?

217
00:15:04,841 --> 00:15:06,057
- Yes.

218
00:15:06,057 --> 00:15:09,203
- That's Miha, she works at
the Brew Hut, she's awesome.

219
00:15:09,203 --> 00:15:11,215
- Oh I'm sure she's so great.

220
00:15:11,215 --> 00:15:12,798
Where's my burrito?

221
00:15:13,781 --> 00:15:15,489
- Oh, sorry, hot lesbo action

222
00:15:15,489 --> 00:15:18,072
always throws my concentration.

223
00:15:23,242 --> 00:15:24,909
- Where's my knife?

224
00:15:24,909 --> 00:15:27,598
- Huh?
- The knife to cut my food.

225
00:15:27,598 --> 00:15:30,681
- Oh, I didn't get you one, you know.

226
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:35,624
- So you stopped me from
getting a plastic knife because

227
00:15:35,624 --> 00:15:37,072
I can kill myself with it?

228
00:15:37,072 --> 00:15:37,905
Seriously?

229
00:15:38,902 --> 00:15:42,152
- You're right, I'm never caring again.

230
00:15:45,096 --> 00:15:49,494
- Are you upset because
she doesn't have a penis?

231
00:15:49,494 --> 00:15:52,504
And you feel like you don't
have a penis, and you thought

232
00:15:52,504 --> 00:15:55,466
she left you because you don't
have a penis, but now that

233
00:15:55,466 --> 00:15:58,203
she's with someone else without
a penis, you feel like she

234
00:15:58,203 --> 00:16:02,036
should be okay being
with you without a penis?

235
00:16:03,331 --> 00:16:04,164
- Huh?

236
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:06,831
(clock ticking)

237
00:16:16,512 --> 00:16:17,994
- Oh shit I'm sorry man, excuse me,

238
00:16:17,994 --> 00:16:19,408
I'm sorry.
- Yeah, excuse you.

239
00:16:19,408 --> 00:16:21,126
Were you too busy thinking
about the sale on black hair

240
00:16:21,126 --> 00:16:22,830
dye to pay attention
to where you're going?

241
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:23,663
(laughs)

242
00:16:23,663 --> 00:16:26,045
- Okay, just take it down a
notch buddy, like we don't need

243
00:16:26,045 --> 00:16:28,153
to do this, you don't need to
come at me talking about black

244
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,312
hair like this.
- Just walking along minding

245
00:16:29,312 --> 00:16:31,185
my own business and you just run into me.

246
00:16:31,185 --> 00:16:35,746
- Okay man, I know, and
I'm sorry, are you hurt?

247
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:38,478
- Yeah, I am hurt, your
actions affect other people,

248
00:16:38,478 --> 00:16:39,978
not that you care.

249
00:16:42,296 --> 00:16:45,629
- Um, you're right, you're right, so uh,

250
00:16:46,537 --> 00:16:48,454
you have somewhere to go tonight?

251
00:16:48,454 --> 00:16:49,525
- What?

252
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:53,692
- Like, can I call a friend
for you, like a family member,

253
00:16:54,816 --> 00:16:58,061
anything, can I?
- What are you talking about?

254
00:16:58,061 --> 00:17:00,676
- Alright buddy, there are
organizations around here that

255
00:17:00,676 --> 00:17:03,111
help people that are in your
certain situation, and that's

256
00:17:03,111 --> 00:17:06,944
okay, that's fine, I mean--
- I'm not homeless.

257
00:17:10,045 --> 00:17:11,128
- Wait, wait.

258
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,578
Are you Neil?

259
00:17:17,516 --> 00:17:18,349
- No.

260
00:17:20,841 --> 00:17:21,867
(gasps)

261
00:17:21,867 --> 00:17:25,292
- Aww, dude, you're totally Neil.

262
00:17:25,292 --> 00:17:28,720
Ah God now it makes so much more sense.

263
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,035
Even though I'm not really
too sure that was the best way

264
00:17:31,035 --> 00:17:32,562
to go about it, but
that's okay, that's okay,

265
00:17:32,562 --> 00:17:33,833
I understand--
- Yeah well you stole her

266
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,617
away from me.

267
00:17:35,617 --> 00:17:37,231
(sighs)

268
00:17:37,231 --> 00:17:41,242
- Look man, if you still want
to be with someone in love

269
00:17:41,242 --> 00:17:43,464
with you anymore, then you've
got bigger problems to worry

270
00:17:43,464 --> 00:17:44,627
about than me.

271
00:17:44,627 --> 00:17:45,904
- What do you even know?

272
00:17:45,904 --> 00:17:46,737
- Well.

273
00:17:47,612 --> 00:17:49,676
Give me your phone?

274
00:17:49,676 --> 00:17:51,924
- No just, just trust me,
trust me, I'm just putting my

275
00:17:51,924 --> 00:17:56,091
number in here, okay, uh, that
way, you know, if you need

276
00:17:57,295 --> 00:17:59,652
to talk, I can listen, okay?

277
00:17:59,652 --> 00:18:02,474
- Oh so I'm supposed to talk
to the girl who stole my

278
00:18:02,474 --> 00:18:04,974
girl friend about my problems?

279
00:18:05,862 --> 00:18:08,483
- Hey man, if you have a better
idea then go with that one,

280
00:18:08,483 --> 00:18:09,316
okay?

281
00:18:10,951 --> 00:18:12,784
Take care of yourself.

282
00:18:15,884 --> 00:18:19,384
(silently mouthing words)

283
00:18:21,202 --> 00:18:24,633
- Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!

284
00:18:24,633 --> 00:18:27,966
(acoustic guitar music)

285
00:18:29,688 --> 00:18:32,244
Okay, you gotta be reasonable.

286
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:36,182
Just think reasonably, logic and reason.

287
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:38,265
Alright, so, right, okay.

288
00:18:40,221 --> 00:18:42,477
If I can't figure out my
problems by the time this Chinese

289
00:18:42,477 --> 00:18:44,810
food is gone, I'll just die.

290
00:18:45,648 --> 00:18:47,822
That's it, I'll be nothing, period.

291
00:18:47,822 --> 00:18:49,725
♫ Life's too hard

292
00:18:49,725 --> 00:18:52,526
♫ And when I'm hurting

293
00:18:52,526 --> 00:18:55,744
♫ You say you cannot keep control

294
00:18:55,744 --> 00:18:59,744
♫ Cannot keep your hands off me

295
00:19:01,686 --> 00:19:04,936
♫ So what's that mean?

296
00:19:07,127 --> 00:19:09,561
♫ What are you seeing? ♫

297
00:19:09,561 --> 00:19:10,394
Right.

298
00:19:17,478 --> 00:19:18,311
Hey.

299
00:19:21,051 --> 00:19:24,884
Would you still love me
if I wasn't an artist?

300
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,200
- Probably not.

301
00:19:34,989 --> 00:19:37,156
(knocking

302
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:40,475
- Can I help you?

303
00:19:40,475 --> 00:19:43,872
- Uh no, I'm just waiting for
the Chinese place to open.

304
00:19:43,872 --> 00:19:45,372
- I own the place.

305
00:19:46,437 --> 00:19:48,260
Don't be racist.

306
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,093
- Okay.

307
00:19:52,031 --> 00:19:55,364
- You want a cup of coffee or something?

308
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:02,624
You know when my parents
retired, I took this place over.

309
00:20:02,624 --> 00:20:03,902
- Adopted parents?

310
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,540
- Yeah I know you only ever
hear of white people adopting

311
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,040
Asian kids, right?

312
00:20:08,052 --> 00:20:09,957
- I didn't mean it like that.

313
00:20:09,957 --> 00:20:11,649
- Don't sweat it man, I've heard it all.

314
00:20:11,649 --> 00:20:14,717
My parents actually did
pretty well by this place, so,

315
00:20:14,717 --> 00:20:17,031
I ended up going to an
expensive prep school.

316
00:20:17,031 --> 00:20:18,114
That was fun.

317
00:20:19,304 --> 00:20:21,421
- I was a Jewish kid.

318
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:23,654
- Dude, I'm so sorry. (chuckles)

319
00:20:23,654 --> 00:20:25,544
- Don't piss me off or I'll do your taxes.

320
00:20:25,544 --> 00:20:27,627
(laughs)

321
00:20:28,749 --> 00:20:31,379
- So, you love my lo mein so
much you'd wait out all night

322
00:20:31,379 --> 00:20:33,443
in the parking lot for it?

323
00:20:33,443 --> 00:20:34,961
- Yeah, absolutely.

324
00:20:34,961 --> 00:20:36,950
- Well, it's a family recipe.

325
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,644
I think it's the best in town.

326
00:20:38,644 --> 00:20:41,212
I think our authentic
stuff's even better, though.

327
00:20:41,212 --> 00:20:42,578
- That sounds great.

328
00:20:42,578 --> 00:20:44,848
- I could whip you up some
duck blood if you want?

329
00:20:44,848 --> 00:20:48,681
- No I'm actually gonna
pass on that, I think.

330
00:20:50,908 --> 00:20:53,272
- [Owner] You doing okay?
- Yeah.

331
00:20:53,272 --> 00:20:56,410
- Comfort food's kind of a
funny business, you catch people

332
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:58,648
at their best and at their worst.

333
00:20:58,648 --> 00:21:01,383
People celebrate their job
promotions with egg rolls,

334
00:21:01,383 --> 00:21:03,693
they also amend broken hearts with them.

335
00:21:03,693 --> 00:21:05,301
- Makes sense.

336
00:21:05,301 --> 00:21:08,017
- I'm gonna whip you up the
biggest plate of lo mein

337
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,140
you've ever seen.

338
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,266
- Thanks.

339
00:21:10,266 --> 00:21:11,921
- It's on the house, too.

340
00:21:11,921 --> 00:21:13,499
- You don't have to do that.

341
00:21:13,499 --> 00:21:15,409
- [Owner] Well just promise me something.

342
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:17,019
- What's that?

343
00:21:17,019 --> 00:21:19,536
- I don't want to see
you here all the time.

344
00:21:19,536 --> 00:21:23,703
Start making a difference for
yourself today, accept help.

345
00:21:24,906 --> 00:21:26,850
- From a fortune cookie, isn't it?

346
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,504
- It was totally from a fortune cookie.

347
00:21:28,504 --> 00:21:30,587
(laughs)

348
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,757
- God I hate you.

349
00:21:34,757 --> 00:21:35,590
- I know.

350
00:21:36,448 --> 00:21:38,115
- Okay, here you go.

351
00:21:41,178 --> 00:21:42,732
- This has a roofie in it right?

352
00:21:42,732 --> 00:21:44,103
- Nope, two.

353
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:46,069
Tolerance has gone up. (laughs)

354
00:21:46,069 --> 00:21:50,354
- But not my tolerance
for blacks, right Jew boy?

355
00:21:50,354 --> 00:21:52,712
- Dave's go to for ice
breaking has always been

356
00:21:52,712 --> 00:21:54,326
hilarious racism.

357
00:21:54,326 --> 00:21:55,847
- Yeah I know.

358
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:57,950
- Well hey, I'm happy
that you came out though.

359
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,603
Does it feel good to get out of the house?

360
00:21:59,603 --> 00:22:01,067
- I get out of the house.

361
00:22:01,067 --> 00:22:02,512
- He never leaves.

362
00:22:02,512 --> 00:22:05,448
Except to get take out or
have meltdowns on lesbians.

363
00:22:05,448 --> 00:22:06,936
- Yeah, sorry about that.

364
00:22:06,936 --> 00:22:09,839
- No man, don't worry about it, it's fine.

365
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:13,735
Hey let me talk to you
something real fast.

366
00:22:13,735 --> 00:22:15,965
I just want you to know that
I understand what it's like

367
00:22:15,965 --> 00:22:18,277
to be upset and in pain.

368
00:22:18,277 --> 00:22:20,303
Look man I have made countless
mistakes, probably more

369
00:22:20,303 --> 00:22:21,470
than you have.

370
00:22:23,283 --> 00:22:24,116
Look.

371
00:22:25,099 --> 00:22:25,932
- Okay.

372
00:22:27,706 --> 00:22:30,596
- So when I was younger, I went
through a lot of pain trying

373
00:22:30,596 --> 00:22:32,616
to figure who I was.

374
00:22:32,616 --> 00:22:33,449
The only thing that made sense to me

375
00:22:33,449 --> 00:22:35,782
was taking it out on myself.

376
00:22:37,048 --> 00:22:37,965
- Like cut?

377
00:22:39,489 --> 00:22:41,656
- Yeah dude, like cutting.

378
00:22:43,891 --> 00:22:44,724
I mean I don't have any
scars, I never did it,

379
00:22:44,724 --> 00:22:46,641
but I thought about it.

380
00:22:48,723 --> 00:22:49,556
A lot.

381
00:22:59,373 --> 00:23:01,924
So have you thought
about like, I don't know,

382
00:23:01,924 --> 00:23:04,165
doing something to distract
yourself like, I mean,

383
00:23:04,165 --> 00:23:06,155
you're a painter, aren't you?
- Yeah.

384
00:23:06,155 --> 00:23:08,759
- That's the problem with
making your hobby into your job.

385
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:10,707
It kills the relaxation factor.

386
00:23:10,707 --> 00:23:12,449
- He's right.

387
00:23:12,449 --> 00:23:14,440
- Well then let's hope that
no one starts paying you to

388
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,753
make girls uncomfortable at
the public library, Dave.

389
00:23:17,753 --> 00:23:19,541
(laughs)

390
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:21,579
- Maybe I should meet somebody.

391
00:23:21,579 --> 00:23:23,147
- Yeah, dating could be fun.

392
00:23:23,147 --> 00:23:25,496
I mean, if you're ready for it.

393
00:23:25,496 --> 00:23:26,486
You know what?

394
00:23:26,486 --> 00:23:29,684
I am actually on this
really great dating app.

395
00:23:29,684 --> 00:23:32,077
Let me text it to you real fast.

396
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,941
- Aren't you still with Amanda?

397
00:23:33,941 --> 00:23:36,978
- No, that was purely sexual.

398
00:23:36,978 --> 00:23:37,978
Be an adult.

399
00:23:40,358 --> 00:23:42,650
- I've been on the app
for a while and I love it.

400
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,219
- It's for blind chicks, right?

401
00:23:44,219 --> 00:23:45,665
(laughs)

402
00:23:45,665 --> 00:23:46,498
- Yes.

403
00:23:48,884 --> 00:23:51,801
Okay come on, let's take a picture.

404
00:23:52,673 --> 00:23:54,863
Whoa, whoa, what the fuck are you doing?

405
00:23:54,863 --> 00:23:56,348
- I need a profile picture, right?

406
00:23:56,348 --> 00:23:58,705
- Yeah, and this app is
strictly photo based man, so you

407
00:23:58,705 --> 00:24:01,144
have to make it count.
- You were doing duck face.

408
00:24:01,144 --> 00:24:03,343
Don't do duck face, fuck face.

409
00:24:03,343 --> 00:24:04,996
- He helps in his own way.

410
00:24:04,996 --> 00:24:05,913
Okay, here.

411
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:09,386
Try a high angle and smile.

412
00:24:09,386 --> 00:24:11,375
You don't have to poop.

413
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:12,208
- Nope.

414
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,347
- Just think of the Holocaust.

415
00:24:15,347 --> 00:24:17,072
(laughs)

416
00:24:17,072 --> 00:24:17,905
- Asshole.

417
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,760
- Okay, do you think we could
make it just a little bit more

418
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,339
eye catching?

419
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:26,787
- Yeah I'm sure I could pump it up.

420
00:24:26,787 --> 00:24:29,984
- Awesome, because I was
thinking like a bird but like a

421
00:24:29,984 --> 00:24:33,003
powerful bird, like a blue
jay and it's just, it's eyes

422
00:24:33,003 --> 00:24:36,270
are piercing, it's coming at
you, you know, something to

423
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:38,671
tell the people, we're smart,
we're capable and we're

424
00:24:38,671 --> 00:24:40,192
understanding, you know?

425
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:42,015
Like any great bird.

426
00:24:42,015 --> 00:24:43,243
- Right.

427
00:24:43,243 --> 00:24:44,869
- So you think you can make that happen?

428
00:24:44,869 --> 00:24:46,391
- I'm sorry what exactly?

429
00:24:46,391 --> 00:24:49,156
- A bird, a bird, like a
blue jay but it's powerful,

430
00:24:49,156 --> 00:24:50,010
you know?

431
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:52,162
Something to tell the
people what we're all about.

432
00:24:52,162 --> 00:24:53,983
- You're a landscaping company.

433
00:24:53,983 --> 00:24:54,982
- Yes.

434
00:24:54,982 --> 00:24:56,557
- And you want a bird?

435
00:24:56,557 --> 00:25:00,373
- I don't want a bird,
I want a powerful bird,

436
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:03,542
that tells the people we're
coming for you, you know?

437
00:25:03,542 --> 00:25:05,292
Does that make sense?

438
00:25:06,389 --> 00:25:07,222
- Yes.

439
00:25:08,985 --> 00:25:09,818
- Bird.

440
00:25:16,607 --> 00:25:18,607
(thuds)

441
00:25:22,404 --> 00:25:24,987
(door squeaks)

442
00:25:27,076 --> 00:25:29,409
(shuffling)

443
00:25:30,895 --> 00:25:35,062
- Come on dude, paycheck,
paycheck, come on, be there.

444
00:25:37,809 --> 00:25:38,642
Nah, dog.

445
00:25:42,071 --> 00:25:44,821
(phone vibrates)

446
00:25:48,689 --> 00:25:50,611
(acoustic guitar music)

447
00:25:50,611 --> 00:25:53,540
- Alright time for a flaw check.

448
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,319
Minimal acne.

449
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:58,041
Hairline not receding enough yet.

450
00:25:58,041 --> 00:25:59,906
Eyes could be wider.

451
00:25:59,906 --> 00:26:00,739
Teeth.

452
00:26:03,092 --> 00:26:05,511
Well I did the best I could.

453
00:26:05,511 --> 00:26:09,678
I'd say I'm rocking my substandard
genetics at about 110%.

454
00:26:10,974 --> 00:26:12,474
Here goes nothing.

455
00:26:19,303 --> 00:26:20,492
(knocks)

456
00:26:20,492 --> 00:26:23,139
- [Woman] Door's open.

457
00:26:23,139 --> 00:26:25,639
(door creaks)

458
00:26:34,523 --> 00:26:37,628
- Hey it's Neil from the internet.

459
00:26:37,628 --> 00:26:38,628
- I hope so.

460
00:26:45,578 --> 00:26:47,745
Have a seat, stay a while.

461
00:26:50,455 --> 00:26:53,720
(footsteps echo)

462
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,803
(typing)

463
00:27:04,341 --> 00:27:06,341
- So, what do you study?

464
00:27:07,447 --> 00:27:12,398
- Oh I'm in medical school
so that's basically my life.

465
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:13,823
Do you do college?

466
00:27:13,823 --> 00:27:16,630
- No, I didn't even finish
high school. (chuckles)

467
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:17,463
- Cool.

468
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,718
So do you want to have sex?

469
00:27:26,718 --> 00:27:30,885
I can't stay up all night
until we get to it organically.

470
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,313
(shuffling)

471
00:27:47,262 --> 00:27:48,345
- Yeah, sure.

472
00:27:50,409 --> 00:27:53,159
(footsteps echo)

473
00:28:00,043 --> 00:28:01,444
- So what are you doing tomorrow?

474
00:28:01,444 --> 00:28:06,353
- Tomorrow is my happy day, I
get to sleep in until 10 AM,

475
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:10,819
then study, I don't have
to put pants on ever.

476
00:28:10,819 --> 00:28:11,986
Not even once.

477
00:28:14,093 --> 00:28:14,926
- I just thought maybe--
(loud gasp)

478
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:16,426
- What time is it?

479
00:28:17,443 --> 00:28:18,812
- It's 10:30.

480
00:28:18,812 --> 00:28:20,787
- Okay, Breaking Bad time.

481
00:28:20,787 --> 00:28:21,971
- You haven't seen it yet?

482
00:28:21,971 --> 00:28:24,312
- I'm studying to be a doctor,

483
00:28:24,312 --> 00:28:26,979
I miss out on pop culture stuff.

484
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:31,415
You're welcome to leave or stay here.

485
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:34,123
- Cool.

486
00:28:39,553 --> 00:28:42,136
(guitar music)

487
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:51,845
♫ When a car drives by
my heart starts to pace

488
00:28:51,845 --> 00:28:54,630

489
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:58,797
♫ Took me so long to see all these things

490
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:04,250
♫ And I'll be damned if
my phone never rings ♫

491
00:29:05,554 --> 00:29:07,681

00:29:07,681 --> 00:29:11,494
♫ Anywhere for you, it's true

500

It's just so wild to feel this way.

501
00:29:38,636 --> 00:29:41,907
I know it's sudden, but, she
just makes me feel all crazy,

502
00:29:41,907 --> 00:29:44,908
makes my chest feel funny
just thinking about her.

503
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:48,044
- You were with your last
partner for a long time.

504
00:29:48,044 --> 00:29:50,027
New things are exciting.

505
00:29:50,027 --> 00:29:54,194
- It's more than that, she's
just really honest and direct.

506
00:29:55,047 --> 00:29:57,266
- How often do you see her?

507
00:29:57,266 --> 00:29:59,790
- Just Fridays mostly.

508
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,486
- [Counselor] Mostly?

509
00:30:01,486 --> 00:30:03,929
- Only Fridays, she's in
medical school, so she doesn't

510
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:05,624
have a lot of free time.

511
00:30:05,624 --> 00:30:07,560
- But you talk throughout the week?

512
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:12,129
- Not exactly, but you know,
it's hard being a doctor.

513
00:30:12,129 --> 00:30:15,849
- Yeah, but I mean, I had
lots of boyfriends when I was

514
00:30:15,849 --> 00:30:20,631
in medical school, it wasn't
that difficult to keep up.

515
00:30:20,631 --> 00:30:22,452
(clock ticks)

516
00:30:22,452 --> 00:30:23,533
- Really?

517
00:30:23,533 --> 00:30:28,070
- I was kind of a slut
now that I think about it.

518
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,320
- Good to know.

519
00:30:30,923 --> 00:30:32,988
- I just think it would be good
for you not to put all your

520
00:30:32,988 --> 00:30:37,162
eggs in one basket, especially
after you've had a huge

521
00:30:37,162 --> 00:30:38,079
life event.

522
00:30:39,809 --> 00:30:41,092
- What do you mean?

523
00:30:41,092 --> 00:30:43,904
- You know, the killing yourself thing.

524
00:30:43,904 --> 00:30:46,004
- I told you I didn't do that.

525
00:30:46,004 --> 00:30:48,690
- And I told you I don't believe you.

526
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:51,207
I just think you should fill
your time with other things

527
00:30:51,207 --> 00:30:53,601
until you see her again.

528
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:54,684
- I guess so.

529
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,964
- Plus you met her on a hookup app.

530
00:30:59,964 --> 00:31:02,102
- It's not just for hookups.

531
00:31:02,102 --> 00:31:03,269
- Yeah, it is.

532
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:08,771
I joined and it was like being
dipped in a piranha tank.

533
00:31:08,771 --> 00:31:11,089
- You use a dating app?

534
00:31:11,089 --> 00:31:13,756
- Not anymore, I'm not pathetic.

535
00:31:18,346 --> 00:31:22,579
♫ They say the dead don't talk

536
00:31:22,579 --> 00:31:26,806
♫ Why are you not shutting up

537
00:31:26,806 --> 00:31:31,407
♫ Because you're done
with him you're dead to me

538
00:31:31,407 --> 00:31:34,353
♫ And the dead don't talk

539
00:31:34,353 --> 00:31:36,610
♫ Gun fire ♫

540
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:38,137
- Hey man I haven't seen you lately.

541
00:31:38,137 --> 00:31:39,905
- Yeah I just kind of stay in a lot.

542
00:31:39,905 --> 00:31:43,216
- Yeah I know you've been going
through a tough time lately.

543
00:31:43,216 --> 00:31:44,630
- It's on Twitter.

544
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,832
- Of course it is.

545
00:31:46,832 --> 00:31:50,582
(commotion, people chatting)

546
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:57,313
(gasps)

547
00:31:58,247 --> 00:31:59,080
(giggles)

548
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,493
Good to see you, kiddo.

549
00:32:00,493 --> 00:32:04,590
- It's been too long, I feel
like it's been too long.

550
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,366
It looks like you're doing good.

551
00:32:06,366 --> 00:32:08,721
I tried to call a few times after I heard.

552
00:32:08,721 --> 00:32:10,955
- Thanks, I'm doing alright though.

553
00:32:10,955 --> 00:32:15,043
- Honestly, I am way too
young for someone I slept with

554
00:32:15,043 --> 00:32:16,572
to die.

555
00:32:16,572 --> 00:32:17,460
(laughs)

556
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,983
I mean, even if it was
back in high school.

557
00:32:19,983 --> 00:32:22,707
- So far so good, I mean, my
brakes aren't making a funny

558
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:25,402
noise so there's still hope.

559
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:27,345
- Well, is there anything you need?

560
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:28,840
- No I'm all good.

561
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,082
- Hey, I thought that was you.

562
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:32,165
- Oh hey man.

563
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:35,723
- Oh man I love you.

564
00:32:35,723 --> 00:32:36,640
I hate you.

565
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,330
- Nice to see you too.

566
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:43,473
You know, I swear she used to like me.

567
00:32:43,473 --> 00:32:45,088
- She never liked you.

568
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,619
- Uh, third grade,

569
00:32:46,619 --> 00:32:48,024
she ate my glue.
- I think she just liked

570
00:32:48,024 --> 00:32:48,946
the taste of glue.

571
00:32:48,946 --> 00:32:49,935
(laughs)

572
00:32:49,935 --> 00:32:51,518
- So, how's Amanda?

573
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,853
- We broke up.

574
00:32:54,853 --> 00:32:56,848
- Oh recently?

575
00:32:56,848 --> 00:32:57,967
- Yeah.

576
00:32:57,967 --> 00:32:58,967
- Oh, sorry.

577
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:01,677
Still doing the design work on the side?

578
00:33:01,677 --> 00:33:03,546
- Actually I went full
time a couple years ago.

579
00:33:03,546 --> 00:33:05,995
So with the painting and the
graphic design I'm actually

580
00:33:05,995 --> 00:33:07,778
doing alright.

581
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:10,861
- Yeah man, I can never do what you do.

582
00:33:10,861 --> 00:33:12,466
Creating stuff for other people,

583
00:33:12,466 --> 00:33:14,292
it's gotta be hard.
- No you just gotta find

584
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:16,034
something you like in what they like.

585
00:33:16,034 --> 00:33:17,901
- Oh I'm sure.

586
00:33:17,901 --> 00:33:20,977
Look I'm not trying to put you
down, I mean, I wish I could

587
00:33:20,977 --> 00:33:22,094
sell out.

588
00:33:22,094 --> 00:33:23,264
- Thanks.

589
00:33:23,264 --> 00:33:26,537
- Well listen man, I really
gotta get going but hit me up

590
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:28,273
sometime, we need to catch up.

591
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:29,106
- Cool.

592
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:38,420
I'm still safe.

593
00:33:39,378 --> 00:33:40,625
(keyboard keys clicking)

594
00:33:40,625 --> 00:33:44,792
- Alright I'm almost finished,
I said 8:30 and it's 8:28.

595
00:33:46,038 --> 00:33:48,179
- Pretty strict schedule
for personal life.

596
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:52,583
- Well my stepdad used to
say that you need to live how

597
00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:55,372
other people won't so you can
live how other people can't.

598
00:33:55,372 --> 00:33:58,622
The parenting acumen of Attila The Hun.

599
00:34:01,102 --> 00:34:04,393
But it's work as it can't be beat.

600
00:34:04,393 --> 00:34:05,560
Be right back.

601
00:34:13,122 --> 00:34:14,326
- You okay?

602
00:34:14,326 --> 00:34:16,243
- [Girl] Just a second.

603
00:34:17,619 --> 00:34:19,652
Give me a drum roll.

604
00:34:19,652 --> 00:34:22,745
- What?
- [Girl] A drum roll please.

605
00:34:22,745 --> 00:34:25,578
(drumming on leg)

606
00:34:30,452 --> 00:34:34,101
(girl makes mouth noises)

607
00:34:34,101 --> 00:34:36,018
(hums)

608
00:35:22,595 --> 00:35:25,364
- I just don't understand
why he'd treat me like that.

609
00:35:25,364 --> 00:35:27,845
- Sounds like an asshole.

610
00:35:27,845 --> 00:35:30,312
- We've been friends forever.

611
00:35:30,312 --> 00:35:33,370
We met in grade school and
starting painting together.

612
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:34,787
- Aw that's cute.

613
00:35:36,792 --> 00:35:40,111
- I just feel like maybe I
hurt his feelings or something.

614
00:35:40,111 --> 00:35:40,944
- Maybe.

615
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:46,920
- Do you have any friends like that?

616
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,837
- Nope, my friends are pretty cool.

617
00:35:50,802 --> 00:35:52,566
- We should all hang out.
- And it's time for Breaking

618
00:35:52,566 --> 00:35:53,399
Bad.

619
00:35:56,563 --> 00:35:57,396
Yup.

620
00:35:59,795 --> 00:36:02,712
- Come on just one check, just one.

621
00:36:04,018 --> 00:36:05,185
Of course not.

622
00:36:06,446 --> 00:36:09,029
(guitar music)

623
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:14,870
♫ If you don't like the
gifts then you should leave

624
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:19,037
♫ Hate this sort of
thing then you should go

625
00:36:19,979 --> 00:36:22,140
♫ Wish leaving was like ♫

626
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,723
(chair creaks)

627
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,791
(knocks)

628
00:36:42,791 --> 00:36:43,624
- Yeah?

629
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:50,045
- I just gotta talk to you
about something real quick.

630
00:36:50,045 --> 00:36:51,045
- What's up?

631
00:36:52,863 --> 00:36:56,363
- So today's gonna be my last day, and uh,

632
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:01,008
I'm out this bitch.

633
00:37:06,563 --> 00:37:09,334
That was supposed to be Back in Black.

634
00:37:09,334 --> 00:37:10,794
- Okay.

635
00:37:10,794 --> 00:37:12,827
- Is the WiFi down or something?

636
00:37:12,827 --> 00:37:14,077
- I don't know.

637
00:37:16,181 --> 00:37:20,152
- Uh, so, today, I'm not
gonna be back after today,

638
00:37:20,152 --> 00:37:24,317
and you're a terrible boss,
so, I'm gonna go out on my own

639
00:37:24,317 --> 00:37:28,903
and I'm gonna be better for
it, and that's about it.

640
00:37:28,903 --> 00:37:30,195
- Okay.

641
00:37:30,195 --> 00:37:31,028
- Alright.

642
00:37:37,404 --> 00:37:40,313
- You uh, you gonna leave?

643
00:37:40,313 --> 00:37:41,146
- Oh yeah.

644
00:37:50,504 --> 00:37:52,504
That's enough for today.

645
00:38:01,561 --> 00:38:05,478
Man I should really black
all these things out.

646
00:38:06,941 --> 00:38:11,029
Wait, no, that's a really
sad thing to think.

647
00:38:11,029 --> 00:38:11,862
Yikes.

648
00:38:13,963 --> 00:38:16,713
(phone vibrates)

649
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:20,029
Hello?

650
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:24,700
No, I'm not doing anything.

651
00:38:26,517 --> 00:38:28,709
- And I said F a bunch of
that, and I poured the guy's

652
00:38:28,709 --> 00:38:31,360
coffee down the drain.

653
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,465
- You see, that's exactly why
I had to get out of retail

654
00:38:33,465 --> 00:38:36,193
service, the people are so stupid.

655
00:38:36,193 --> 00:38:37,934
- Seriously.

656
00:38:37,934 --> 00:38:40,211
- I worked at the mall, I
really didn't mind it that much.

657
00:38:40,211 --> 00:38:42,235
- Yeah but you didn't work
during the worst times.

658
00:38:42,235 --> 00:38:43,649
- Christmas, oh my gosh.

659
00:38:43,649 --> 00:38:45,107
- That was seasonal.
- The call center was

660
00:38:45,107 --> 00:38:46,456
way better.

661
00:38:46,456 --> 00:38:48,230
- You don't make tips at a call center.

662
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:50,802
- You can have a tip of my dick.

663
00:38:50,802 --> 00:38:52,919
- Well you would make minimum wage then.

664
00:38:52,919 --> 00:38:54,487
(chuckles)

665
00:38:54,487 --> 00:38:55,848
I don't miss it.

666
00:38:55,848 --> 00:38:57,660
- You don't miss what?
- Punching the clock like

667
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,479
the rest of us normies.

668
00:38:59,479 --> 00:39:01,831
- Well it's not easy, but,
honestly I'm just really

669
00:39:01,831 --> 00:39:03,564
surprised it's still working out for me.

670
00:39:03,564 --> 00:39:05,545
- But are you really making a living?

671
00:39:05,545 --> 00:39:08,249
I mean, if you wanna live
under a bridge while you do it,

672
00:39:08,249 --> 00:39:09,904
but that's not really my thing.

673
00:39:09,904 --> 00:39:11,137
- I do alright.

674
00:39:11,137 --> 00:39:13,084
- Yeah but you don't have kids.

675
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:14,417
- Or a mortgage.

676
00:39:20,115 --> 00:39:21,663
(clock ticks)

677
00:39:21,663 --> 00:39:24,996
- Are you still seeing that girl Jessie?

678
00:39:26,349 --> 00:39:27,182
- Yes.

679
00:39:28,458 --> 00:39:30,357
- Are you upset because you
still don't feel like you

680
00:39:30,357 --> 00:39:31,440
have a penis?

681
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:36,957
Does it make you feel
threatened in this environment?

682
00:39:38,022 --> 00:39:40,311
- You don't have a penis either.

683
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:42,728
- Don't act like you know me.

684
00:39:44,331 --> 00:39:46,728
- Why do you spend time with
friends that make you feel

685
00:39:46,728 --> 00:39:48,351
the worst?

686
00:39:48,351 --> 00:39:50,992
- Because they've been
with me through everything.

687
00:39:50,992 --> 00:39:54,083
We put on our first art show
together, had our first beers

688
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:54,916
together.

689
00:39:56,021 --> 00:39:58,624
I just gotta show them that
I'm still the cool guy they

690
00:39:58,624 --> 00:40:01,941
used to hang out with.
- But you're not.

691
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,376
- Yeah I am.

692
00:40:03,376 --> 00:40:06,640
- No you're not, and that's a good thing.

693
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,821
I only have four hours a week
to unwind, do you think we

694
00:40:08,821 --> 00:40:09,988
could do that?

695
00:40:11,095 --> 00:40:12,262
- Yeah, sorry.

696
00:40:13,516 --> 00:40:14,349
- Suit up.

697
00:40:19,551 --> 00:40:23,134
♫ I'm a lot more than that

698
00:40:25,991 --> 00:40:30,264
♫ I wanna change the
world but I can't do it

699
00:40:30,264 --> 00:40:34,431
♫ I wanna save myself but
I just don't know how ♫

700

00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:51,309
- Hello?

702
00:40:51,309 --> 00:40:53,328
- [Father] Hey buddy.

703
00:40:53,328 --> 00:40:54,495
- Oh, hey Dad.

704
00:40:55,518 --> 00:40:57,747
- [Father] How are you doing?

705
00:40:57,747 --> 00:40:59,901
- I'm alright.
- [Father] Glad to hear it.

706
00:40:59,901 --> 00:41:03,126
Word got back to me a little
later than I'd like but,

707
00:41:03,126 --> 00:41:04,656
I was worried,
- Dad I gotta go, I got a

708
00:41:04,656 --> 00:41:06,847
lot going on, kind of busy.
- [Father] Alright buddy,

709
00:41:06,847 --> 00:41:11,014
no problem, but please call
me back at this number, okay?

710
00:41:11,967 --> 00:41:15,207
- Alright.
- [Father] I'm serious.

711
00:41:15,207 --> 00:41:18,050
Call me back sometime, I miss you.

712
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:22,217
♫ And I don't live anywhere at all anymore

713
00:41:27,414 --> 00:41:31,931
♫ I don't being here, I never did

714
00:41:31,931 --> 00:41:34,782
♫ If I don't pack my bags ♫

715
00:41:34,782 --> 00:41:36,159
- Fucking asshole.

716
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:37,775
- Actually, he fucked your mom.

717
00:41:37,775 --> 00:41:39,139
- Shut up.

718
00:41:39,139 --> 00:41:41,999
- Whoa, hey, are you okay?

719
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:44,096
- It's bullshit.

720
00:41:44,096 --> 00:41:46,745
And he thought about it.

721
00:41:46,745 --> 00:41:48,541
I was perfectly fine with
him never even coming back

722
00:41:48,541 --> 00:41:50,448
in my life ever again.

723
00:41:50,448 --> 00:41:52,320
- Yeah but you have talked to him?

724
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,721
- Yeah.

725
00:41:53,721 --> 00:41:55,080
After 11 years.

726
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:55,913
11 years.

727
00:41:59,287 --> 00:42:01,051
- Did you guys fight?

728
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:03,642
- Yeah, he thought I
wasn't being realistic

729
00:42:03,642 --> 00:42:05,059
about growing up.

730
00:42:06,546 --> 00:42:08,931
Calls got shorter and shorter
until they just stopped

731
00:42:08,931 --> 00:42:12,687
altogether miraculously
when child support ended.

732
00:42:12,687 --> 00:42:13,687
- I'm sorry.

733
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:16,908
- I worked hard.

734
00:42:18,226 --> 00:42:21,143
Harder than I ever thought I could.

735
00:42:23,238 --> 00:42:25,181
He said I could never be what
I wanted to be and I hated

736
00:42:25,181 --> 00:42:27,499
him so much for it.

737
00:42:27,499 --> 00:42:30,416
I wanted to prove him wrong so bad.

738
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:33,500
Had it all planned out.

739
00:42:34,567 --> 00:42:38,247
I was gonna strike it stinking
rich by the time he hit 70.

740
00:42:38,247 --> 00:42:41,147
Buy the nursing home he was living in.

741
00:42:41,147 --> 00:42:44,082
Replace all the staff with
immigrants and minimum wage

742
00:42:44,082 --> 00:42:47,789
workers and totally
degrade his health care.

743
00:42:47,789 --> 00:42:51,755
Make sure he died alone in
that thin soiled blanket.

744
00:42:51,755 --> 00:42:53,903
Now what, he's just checking in?

745
00:42:53,903 --> 00:42:56,254
Thinks he can just walk right
back into my fucking life

746
00:42:56,254 --> 00:42:58,087
like nothing happened?

747
00:42:59,688 --> 00:43:01,881
He made my childhood miserable.

748
00:43:01,881 --> 00:43:06,014
He second guessed
everything about my life.

749
00:43:06,014 --> 00:43:09,852
Just a macho asshole, doesn't
even deserve me as a son.

750
00:43:09,852 --> 00:43:11,769
He can go fuck himself.

751
00:43:12,746 --> 00:43:14,814
He can go fuck himself.

752
00:43:14,814 --> 00:43:18,635
- Okay, so now that that's
done, is there anything

753
00:43:18,635 --> 00:43:21,740
constructive that you
want to say about it?

754
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:22,990
- I don't know.

755
00:43:24,377 --> 00:43:27,362
- Well he's probably worried
about you, since he heard

756
00:43:27,362 --> 00:43:28,195
about the,

757
00:43:29,721 --> 00:43:31,054
- Yeah probably.

758
00:43:33,061 --> 00:43:37,117
- Call him, but let him know
that you're the one in control.

759
00:43:37,117 --> 00:43:38,450
Because you are.

760
00:43:39,545 --> 00:43:41,609
You're not a kid anymore.

761
00:43:41,609 --> 00:43:44,135
- Yeah, you're grown as shit, man.

762
00:43:44,135 --> 00:43:47,885
- You're right.
- You're like late 30s, right?

763
00:43:48,763 --> 00:43:52,930
- Thank you for that, thank
you, but, I'm just afraid he's

764
00:43:54,118 --> 00:43:56,437
gonna try to turn it around
on me and blame it on me

765
00:43:56,437 --> 00:43:58,764
for not calling in.
- Then you tell him that

766
00:43:58,764 --> 00:44:01,520
people in glass houses shouldn't
jerk off while they take

767
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,353
a shit.

768
00:44:04,299 --> 00:44:06,132
- That actually helps.

769
00:44:07,441 --> 00:44:11,331
♫ You could be doing anything
you could be rolling in ♫

770
00:44:11,331 --> 00:44:14,891
My first car I drove for 11 years.

771
00:44:14,891 --> 00:44:17,252
I mistreated it pretty bad.

772
00:44:17,252 --> 00:44:19,236
I was always broke.

773
00:44:19,236 --> 00:44:23,691
And every late oil change,
every fast acceleration,

774
00:44:23,691 --> 00:44:24,941
delayed repair.

775
00:44:26,419 --> 00:44:28,925
I knew I could have treated it better.

776
00:44:28,925 --> 00:44:30,781
I was worried all the time
about the damage I was doing

777
00:44:30,781 --> 00:44:34,082
and how it would all add up someday.

778
00:44:34,082 --> 00:44:37,350
But eventually I traded
it in and it was fine.

779
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:41,117
I think I worry about
consequence too much.

780
00:44:41,117 --> 00:44:43,055
I don't really know
what I'm talking about.

781
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:44,748
♫ It is real, it is real. ♫

782
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:46,981
I should be afraid of dying though.

783
00:44:46,981 --> 00:44:47,981
Like really.

784
00:44:48,995 --> 00:44:51,245
I'm hungry, hungry is good.

785
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:55,633
Hungry is the opposite of dead.

786
00:44:56,914 --> 00:44:58,595
I am alive.

787
00:44:58,595 --> 00:45:01,928
(acoustic guitar music)

788
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:13,791
(phone vibrates)

789
00:45:17,328 --> 00:45:19,811
- [Father] Hey buddy.
- Hey.

790
00:45:19,811 --> 00:45:22,330
- [Father] How are you doing?

791
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:23,163
- Fine.

792
00:45:24,144 --> 00:45:26,992
- I'm glad, I was worried.

793
00:45:26,992 --> 00:45:28,438
- Worried?

794
00:45:28,438 --> 00:45:29,271
Really?

795
00:45:29,271 --> 00:45:30,746
It's been 11 years, I guess
you just knew you were gonna

796
00:45:30,746 --> 00:45:32,109
get around to it at some point.

797
00:45:32,109 --> 00:45:33,847
- Now, now, calm down.

798
00:45:33,847 --> 00:45:35,952
- Bad choice of words, I was
completely calm and then you

799
00:45:35,952 --> 00:45:38,846
called, so why, what is
it and what do you want?

800
00:45:38,846 --> 00:45:42,869
- You're grown up, and I
know, I don't really know you

801
00:45:42,869 --> 00:45:44,485
anymore.

802
00:45:44,485 --> 00:45:47,340
- [Neil] Who's fault is that?

803
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:49,414
- Could I just ask you something?

804
00:45:49,414 --> 00:45:53,758
You ever had something in
your life that you regret?

805
00:45:53,758 --> 00:45:56,693
You know there's something
pretty big, something that

806
00:45:56,693 --> 00:46:00,777
you kind of take with you wherever you go?

807
00:46:00,777 --> 00:46:05,126
Something that's always kind
of in the back of your mind?

808
00:46:05,126 --> 00:46:06,659
- Yeah I guess so.

809
00:46:06,659 --> 00:46:09,296
- Well that's what our
relationship is to me.

810
00:46:09,296 --> 00:46:13,512
I mean it got a little rough
and I stepped back, but,

811
00:46:13,512 --> 00:46:15,757
stepping back was shameful.

812
00:46:15,757 --> 00:46:17,740
I felt terrible about it.

813
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:21,540
So terrible I didn't call,
because, well it had been

814
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:22,373
so long.

815
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:28,304
But it just got worse, you
know, I'd wait longer, and it'd

816
00:46:28,304 --> 00:46:30,137
be even more shameful.

817
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:32,969
(sighs)

818
00:46:32,969 --> 00:46:37,109
Could have gone on forever
honestly, but, when I heard

819
00:46:37,109 --> 00:46:41,196
what happened, it was sort
of like a wake up call.

820
00:46:41,196 --> 00:46:45,024
I realized I wouldn't always
be able to put it off.

821
00:46:45,024 --> 00:46:49,626
This is no excuse, hell,
it's barely a worthwhile

822
00:46:49,626 --> 00:46:52,376
explanation, but, it's the truth.

823
00:46:54,014 --> 00:46:55,931
I'm sorry, I really am.

824
00:47:00,579 --> 00:47:03,072
You still there, buddy?

825
00:47:03,072 --> 00:47:07,167
- Yeah, I just don't really
know what to say to that.

826
00:47:07,167 --> 00:47:11,900
- If you still want to talk
to me I'll take it as a win.

827
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,407
- Well I haven't hung up.

828
00:47:14,407 --> 00:47:18,001
- Tell me about yourself,
what are you doing for work?

829
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:20,903
- I sell paintings and do graphic design.

830
00:47:20,903 --> 00:47:22,388
- Cool, no shit?

831
00:47:22,388 --> 00:47:24,205
That's cool as hell, buddy.

832
00:47:24,205 --> 00:47:25,822
- You were never really a big fan of that.

833
00:47:25,822 --> 00:47:29,055
- Yeah well I'm a stupid
old man. (chuckles)

834
00:47:29,055 --> 00:47:31,252
There are plenty of us
out there, trust me.

835
00:47:31,252 --> 00:47:34,359
- What about you, what
have you been up to?

836
00:47:34,359 --> 00:47:37,501
- I'm retired, old man, remember?

837
00:47:37,501 --> 00:47:39,154
- Not that old.

838
00:47:39,154 --> 00:47:40,321
- You kidding?

839
00:47:41,288 --> 00:47:43,871
You should hear me take a piss.

840
00:47:45,278 --> 00:47:46,847
- It was really great, I just
never thought that me and

841
00:47:46,847 --> 00:47:49,205
my dad would actually reconnect.

842
00:47:49,205 --> 00:47:51,596
- Okay, I can't believe this,

843
00:47:51,596 --> 00:47:54,911
you're talking about your dad now?

844
00:47:54,911 --> 00:47:57,193
I can't do this, the finals
are coming up and we need

845
00:47:57,193 --> 00:47:58,649
to wrap this up.

846
00:47:58,649 --> 00:47:59,602
- What do you mean?

847
00:47:59,602 --> 00:48:01,969
- Fun, sex and Breaking Bad,
I don't know how I could have

848
00:48:01,969 --> 00:48:03,423
been more clear.

849
00:48:03,423 --> 00:48:05,090
- That's what I'm into, it's awesome.

850
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,259
(sighs)

851
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:09,443
- We met on a hookup app, we
slept together on the first

852
00:48:09,443 --> 00:48:13,405
date, you're putting more
into this than I want.

853
00:48:13,405 --> 00:48:15,505
- I just had something
interesting to talk about.

854
00:48:15,505 --> 00:48:18,641
- You're gonna get hurt
if you keep doing this.

855
00:48:18,641 --> 00:48:20,377
It's not what you want.

856
00:48:20,377 --> 00:48:22,393
- It's exactly what I want, I love this.

857
00:48:22,393 --> 00:48:23,751
I like it casual.

858
00:48:23,751 --> 00:48:25,364
- I think what you want is a girlfriend.

859
00:48:25,364 --> 00:48:28,329
- I had a girlfriend, for years.

860
00:48:28,329 --> 00:48:30,121
I'm not looking for anything serious.

861
00:48:30,121 --> 00:48:32,725
- You should spend your time
trying to find someone who

862
00:48:32,725 --> 00:48:35,245
wants to do these things with
you, you're wasting your time

863
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:39,412
with me when you could be
meeting people or making art.

864
00:48:40,454 --> 00:48:42,965
You want to spend your life
with someone and there's no

865
00:48:42,965 --> 00:48:44,687
shame in that.

866
00:48:44,687 --> 00:48:47,137
But if you keep hanging
out with the wrong people,

867
00:48:47,137 --> 00:48:49,027
you're gonna lose all this
time and you won't even know it

868
00:48:49,027 --> 00:48:50,360
until it's gone.

869
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:52,883
- Wow.

870
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:55,983
You're right.
- I know.

871
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:59,607
- I just can't believe
you put it so simply.

872
00:48:59,607 --> 00:49:03,024
- Smart girls can like sex too, you know.

873
00:49:05,306 --> 00:49:07,139
- Yeah I deserve that.

874
00:49:10,093 --> 00:49:14,260
♫ Heartbreak, heartbreak ♫

875
00:49:15,476 --> 00:49:17,590
The worst is going to sleep
after something bad happens.

876
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:19,074
So I don't.

877
00:49:19,074 --> 00:49:22,311
♫ Heartbreak, fucking heartbreak

878
00:49:22,311 --> 00:49:25,122
♫ Fucking heartbreak ♫

879
00:49:25,122 --> 00:49:28,062
I have an incredible
amount of sauce packets.

880
00:49:28,062 --> 00:49:31,198
Save a couple every time I go out to eat.

881
00:49:31,198 --> 00:49:33,858
They're always there when I need them.

882
00:49:33,858 --> 00:49:36,364
Sometimes I forget they're here
because I don't really need

883
00:49:36,364 --> 00:49:38,450
them so I throw them away.

884
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:42,454
It's because they're free so who cares?

885
00:49:42,454 --> 00:49:44,708
I spent a lot of time learning
that sauce packets and I

886
00:49:44,708 --> 00:49:46,864
have a lot in common.

887
00:49:46,864 --> 00:49:49,441
♫ Just make it loud enough
to raise the fucking dead

888
00:49:49,441 --> 00:49:52,184
♫ I'll never get your voice out of my head

889
00:49:52,184 --> 00:49:56,370
♫ Heartbreak, heartbreak ♫

890
00:49:56,370 --> 00:50:00,699
Is it weird sometimes I
forget I'm not a vampire?

891
00:50:00,699 --> 00:50:03,496
Yes, that's, that's weird.

892
00:50:03,496 --> 00:50:06,592
- That's the name of the
game, easy come, easy go.

893
00:50:06,592 --> 00:50:09,824
Except, you know, come's
spelled different.

894
00:50:09,824 --> 00:50:10,958
- Right.

895
00:50:10,958 --> 00:50:13,800
- I met this one girl on
the app, she was really into

896
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:18,485
daddy-daughter play, so we
did it, and then I never spoke

897
00:50:18,485 --> 00:50:19,587
to her again.

898
00:50:19,587 --> 00:50:21,809
I figured since her dad
left, I would just commit

899
00:50:21,809 --> 00:50:22,809
to the role.

900
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:25,659
- I just really liked her.

901
00:50:25,659 --> 00:50:27,591
- Yeah that's why you swiped right.

902
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:29,015
- No not like that, like,

903
00:50:29,015 --> 00:50:30,923
I thought we really got
along well together.

904
00:50:30,923 --> 00:50:33,695
- But, she just wanted to hook up,

905
00:50:33,695 --> 00:50:35,823
because that's what the app's for, right?

906
00:50:35,823 --> 00:50:36,873
- I guess so.

907
00:50:36,873 --> 00:50:39,771
- Did you ever tell her you wanted more?

908
00:50:39,771 --> 00:50:41,509
- No, not exactly.

909
00:50:41,509 --> 00:50:44,209
- There's no room for
unclear shit in dating.

910
00:50:44,209 --> 00:50:45,399
You've gotta have it down pat.

911
00:50:45,399 --> 00:50:49,347
How can you ever get what
you want if you don't ask?

912
00:50:49,347 --> 00:50:51,027
- I guess I never really
thought about it like that.

913
00:50:51,027 --> 00:50:53,083
- Do you think I would
ever get to pee on a girl

914
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:55,153
if I didn't ask?

915
00:50:55,153 --> 00:50:56,727
- And we're back to normal.

916
00:50:56,727 --> 00:50:59,303
- Hey, it's a horrible
and disgusting metaphor,

917
00:50:59,303 --> 00:51:01,347
but it's still a metaphor.

918
00:51:01,347 --> 00:51:03,559
(guitar music)

919
00:51:03,559 --> 00:51:06,734
- The heart is the strongest
muscle in the human body,

920
00:51:06,734 --> 00:51:09,226
and it can take just about anything.

921
00:51:09,226 --> 00:51:10,878
- Yeah.
- Once I was locked out

922
00:51:10,878 --> 00:51:13,860
of the house, the new lock
and deadbolt were my divorce

923
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:15,946
papers being served.

924
00:51:15,946 --> 00:51:18,998
She kept my guitar, got my guns.

925
00:51:18,998 --> 00:51:23,478
And I'm pretty sure if I
still hadn't had my bike,

926
00:51:23,478 --> 00:51:24,478
I'd be done.

927
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:30,128
But the funny thing is, that
was so terrible, but now,

928
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:34,295
today, I have to really
think to even remember it.

929
00:51:35,604 --> 00:51:39,075
Back then that was the
end of the goddamn world.

930
00:51:39,075 --> 00:51:41,611
I remember riding my bike
away on the highway with tears

931
00:51:41,611 --> 00:51:42,528
in my eyes.

932
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:47,026
I was three or four years
older than you are now.

933
00:51:47,026 --> 00:51:50,414
I was positive my life was over.

934
00:51:50,414 --> 00:51:52,976
And I went back to the
clubhouse and slept on the couch

935
00:51:52,976 --> 00:51:54,476
by the pool table.

936
00:51:55,384 --> 00:52:00,340
It was grim shit, and I woke
up the next day and apparently

937
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:04,129
I just went forward, always forward.

938
00:52:04,129 --> 00:52:05,865
- I guess that's a good way to look at it.

939
00:52:05,865 --> 00:52:08,285
- You know no matter how bad
things are, just remember,

940
00:52:08,285 --> 00:52:13,227
you aren't sleeping on a couch
that smells like biker piss.

941
00:52:13,227 --> 00:52:15,227
So you're doing alright.

942
00:52:16,084 --> 00:52:18,046
- Still riding your bike?

943
00:52:18,046 --> 00:52:21,046
- No way, too rough on the prostate.

944
00:52:21,922 --> 00:52:23,705
When you get to be my age,

945
00:52:23,705 --> 00:52:27,122
everything you think about is down there.

946
00:52:28,334 --> 00:52:30,250
You think maybe, later in the year

947
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:33,000
I could maybe come out and visit?

948
00:52:36,093 --> 00:52:40,093
It's cool if you don't
want me to, I understand.

949
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:47,723
- No yeah, it's cool, we can't
wait another 11 years, right?

950
00:52:47,723 --> 00:52:49,806
- No, we certainly can't.

951
00:52:50,958 --> 00:52:54,150
Let me see if any of my old
buddies are still in town that

952
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:55,843
I can crash with.

953
00:52:55,843 --> 00:52:57,721
- Just stay here.

954
00:52:57,721 --> 00:52:59,554
- You sure about that?

955
00:53:01,402 --> 00:53:03,600
- Yeah, I mean, I have a couch
and it doesn't smell like

956
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:04,888
biker piss.

957
00:53:04,888 --> 00:53:07,016
(chuckles)

958
00:53:07,016 --> 00:53:09,683
(clock ticking)

959
00:53:11,775 --> 00:53:15,261
I just really don't want
to hear I told you so.

960
00:53:15,261 --> 00:53:18,524
- Therapists never say I told you so.

961
00:53:18,524 --> 00:53:21,191
That's pretty much just implied.

962
00:53:22,051 --> 00:53:24,884
Any developments with your father?

963
00:53:26,138 --> 00:53:27,638
- Yeah, we talked.

964
00:53:28,826 --> 00:53:31,375
And he also made me feel
a lot better about stuff.

965
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:33,292
He's coming to visit.

966
00:53:33,292 --> 00:53:37,129
- That's excellent, how
does it make you feel?

967
00:53:37,129 --> 00:53:37,962
- Nervous.

968
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:42,484
Kind of scared to see him

969
00:53:42,484 --> 00:53:45,124
because things aren't going so well.

970
00:53:45,124 --> 00:53:49,291
- Fear is just excitement
wearing a fake mustache.

971
00:53:50,151 --> 00:53:51,234
- I guess so.

972
00:53:53,202 --> 00:53:56,002
Going to see my old friends again tonight.

973
00:53:56,002 --> 00:53:59,223
- The ones who talked down to you?

974
00:53:59,223 --> 00:54:02,223
- That's not entirely true.
- Right.

975
00:54:07,034 --> 00:54:10,045
But back to your father, this
new development is going to

976
00:54:10,045 --> 00:54:11,628
help you immensely.

977
00:54:13,138 --> 00:54:16,093
It's safe to say most of
your problems stem from your

978
00:54:16,093 --> 00:54:18,710
relationship with your father.

979
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:21,286
- Well that just makes
me feel like a cliche.

980
00:54:21,286 --> 00:54:23,597
- You're absolutely cliche.

981
00:54:23,597 --> 00:54:26,047
Artists pretty much all
tied back to the parents

982
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:27,965
one way or another.

983
00:54:27,965 --> 00:54:29,601
- So just like that?

984
00:54:29,601 --> 00:54:31,099
We're all the same?

985
00:54:31,099 --> 00:54:32,863
- Virtually.

986
00:54:32,863 --> 00:54:37,650
Artists are simple, they
just want to be complicated.

987
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:40,241
Now pharmacy tech or something?

988
00:54:40,241 --> 00:54:43,324
Those people are seriously fucked up.

989
00:54:44,609 --> 00:54:46,261
- It's the first sketch I've
done in the last couple weeks

990
00:54:46,261 --> 00:54:47,843
that I've actually liked.

991
00:54:47,843 --> 00:54:49,926
Think I'm gonna paint it.

992
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:53,791
- Well I mean, it's not terrible.

993
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,684
- Yeah, I just really don't like it.

994
00:54:56,684 --> 00:55:00,222
- What do you mean?
- It's not particularly,

995
00:55:00,222 --> 00:55:03,611
- You know I was thinking
it's, it's more like,

996
00:55:03,611 --> 00:55:05,972
it's not interesting.
- Like we've seen it before.

997
00:55:05,972 --> 00:55:08,086
- Oh definitely.

998
00:55:08,086 --> 00:55:10,298
- And I didn't really like it
the first or the second time.

999
00:55:10,298 --> 00:55:11,131
- Exactly.

1000
00:55:14,288 --> 00:55:17,088
- So, big shot artist, you
gonna buy us some drinks?

1001
00:55:17,088 --> 00:55:20,751
- Yeah, drinks would be
sweet, like old times man.

1002
00:55:20,751 --> 00:55:21,849
- Yeah, sure.

1003
00:55:21,849 --> 00:55:26,016
♫ He's got no time for
his life or his friends ♫

1004
00:55:29,042 --> 00:55:32,375
(acoustic guitar music)

1005
00:55:40,399 --> 00:55:43,149
- I'm just saying, what was that?

1006
00:55:46,211 --> 00:55:50,378
My artwork gets a raw deal,
that's all I'm saying.

1007
00:55:51,267 --> 00:55:54,346
- Hey man, I mean, it's
a bullshit business.

1008
00:55:54,346 --> 00:55:55,763
No one gets paid.

1009
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:58,742
- It's not easy getting paid.

1010
00:55:58,742 --> 00:56:01,739
- Well, we aren't all like you.

1011
00:56:01,739 --> 00:56:04,300
All you ever do is talk about yourself.

1012
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:06,135
Always trying to get attention.

1013
00:56:06,135 --> 00:56:07,466
- Yeah but isn't that the whole point?

1014
00:56:07,466 --> 00:56:09,088
- It's about the work, not us.

1015
00:56:09,088 --> 00:56:11,777
- I bet the whole suicide
thing was just a way to get

1016
00:56:11,777 --> 00:56:14,143
attention for his shit.

1017
00:56:14,143 --> 00:56:14,976
- Dude.

1018
00:56:16,635 --> 00:56:19,298
- I've had a few too many man.

1019
00:56:19,298 --> 00:56:21,649
It's probably time for
us to Uber out of here.

1020
00:56:21,649 --> 00:56:24,383
- Yeah, we'll call you up man.

1021
00:56:24,383 --> 00:56:26,383
- Thanks for the drinks.

1022
00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:37,500
- I'm a fucking joke.

1023
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,079
- No you're not.

1024
00:56:39,079 --> 00:56:40,788
- Then what am I?

1025
00:56:40,788 --> 00:56:43,727
- You're my buddy, you've
always been my buddy.

1026
00:56:43,727 --> 00:56:44,560
- Thanks.

1027
00:56:45,463 --> 00:56:48,081
- Well let me tell you
something about Steve and Wayne.

1028
00:56:48,081 --> 00:56:51,721
They're two boys that
grew up to be mean men.

1029
00:56:51,721 --> 00:56:54,465
And you know they're just
jealous of you, you know that,

1030
00:56:54,465 --> 00:56:56,005
right?

1031
00:56:56,005 --> 00:56:57,253
- How so?

1032
00:56:57,253 --> 00:56:59,983
- You're not washing dishes
or working at a drive through

1033
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:03,497
liquor store, you're actually
doing something you enjoy,

1034
00:57:03,497 --> 00:57:06,997
whether you're willing to admit it or not.

1035
00:57:11,169 --> 00:57:15,336
- I just feel like, every
time I start to like myself,

1036
00:57:16,321 --> 00:57:17,571
everyone stops.

1037
00:57:18,687 --> 00:57:20,406
- It's not true.

1038
00:57:20,406 --> 00:57:23,094
We take for granted the people
that love us, and we remember

1039
00:57:23,094 --> 00:57:26,927
the ones that hurt us,
it's just human nature.

1040
00:57:28,659 --> 00:57:30,159
- Yeah I guess so.

1041
00:57:31,866 --> 00:57:35,645
- You remember after graduation,
the girl that dumped you?

1042
00:57:35,645 --> 00:57:36,812
The heavy one?

1043
00:57:37,999 --> 00:57:39,733
- Flower?
- Yeah.

1044
00:57:39,733 --> 00:57:44,269
Except it was spelled Flour.
(laughs)

1045
00:57:44,269 --> 00:57:46,584
Total space cadet.

1046
00:57:46,584 --> 00:57:49,314
- Space cadets are nice.

1047
00:57:49,314 --> 00:57:50,564
She was stupid.

1048
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:53,303
Like ragefully stupid.

1049
00:57:54,855 --> 00:57:57,809
- You remember how when she
broke up with you and she

1050
00:57:57,809 --> 00:58:00,642
hated you, you chased her so hard?

1051
00:58:02,744 --> 00:58:05,244
I know that was stupid, right?

1052
00:58:06,283 --> 00:58:07,616
Feel any better?

1053
00:58:09,038 --> 00:58:10,915
- A little bit.

1054
00:58:10,915 --> 00:58:11,748
I'm sorry.

1055
00:58:13,254 --> 00:58:15,326
My Dad's coming to see me
tomorrow and I think it's just

1056
00:58:15,326 --> 00:58:16,823
messing with my head.

1057
00:58:16,823 --> 00:58:18,349
- Whoa, wait, your Dad?

1058
00:58:18,349 --> 00:58:20,687
The motorcycle one, the
one you haven't spoken to

1059
00:58:20,687 --> 00:58:22,423
in 10 years?

1060
00:58:22,423 --> 00:58:24,578
- Yeah.
- Oh my God,

1061
00:58:24,578 --> 00:58:27,029
everything's gonna be
okay, you're gonna do this,

1062
00:58:27,029 --> 00:58:28,443
oh my gosh.

1063
00:58:28,443 --> 00:58:31,021
You know I love you right?

1064
00:58:31,021 --> 00:58:31,854
- Yeah.

1065
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:37,050
♫ Just laugh ♫

1066
00:58:38,679 --> 00:58:41,953
Just stay cool, yeah, you
haven't seen the guy in a long

1067
00:58:41,953 --> 00:58:45,088
time but it's not a big deal.

1068
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:46,743
Just keep it together, be normal.

1069
00:58:46,743 --> 00:58:50,338
It's nothing, just pretend
he's a mail man or something.

1070
00:58:50,338 --> 00:58:53,433
Like you know him but you don't know him.

1071
00:58:53,433 --> 00:58:55,267
No biggy right?

1072
00:58:55,267 --> 00:58:57,198
No, it's no biggy.

1073
00:58:57,198 --> 00:58:59,351
It's going to be cool.

1074
00:58:59,351 --> 00:59:00,754
Shit, did he hear me?

1075
00:59:00,754 --> 00:59:02,627
Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, fuck.

1076
00:59:02,627 --> 00:59:03,901
- You alright, buddy?

1077
00:59:03,901 --> 00:59:05,693
- Yeah, I'm great.

1078
00:59:05,693 --> 00:59:08,878
- I was worried this was gonna be awkward.

1079
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:09,961
- Not at all.

1080
00:59:14,709 --> 00:59:18,209
This should be pretty comfortable I think.

1081
00:59:19,362 --> 00:59:21,354
- Falling asleep while you're sucking on

1082
00:59:21,354 --> 00:59:24,021
a glass titty a lot, huh?
- Yeah.

1083
00:59:26,576 --> 00:59:30,916
- Well, just as long as you're
not doing it while you're

1084
00:59:30,916 --> 00:59:34,416
cranking one off, sheets are fresh, right?

1085
00:59:37,152 --> 00:59:39,215
- Fresh as monkey's breath.

1086
00:59:39,215 --> 00:59:41,632
- Good enough for an old man.

1087
00:59:42,572 --> 00:59:44,729
- If you want to watch TV
or something, I can show you

1088
00:59:44,729 --> 00:59:46,548
how the remote works.

1089
00:59:46,548 --> 00:59:48,957
- I'm not that old okay?

1090
00:59:48,957 --> 00:59:52,555
Anyway I wanted to chat
with you for a while.

1091
00:59:52,555 --> 00:59:55,537
I can see you're on edge,
I hope I'm not being

1092
00:59:55,537 --> 00:59:56,787
too disruptive.

1093
00:59:59,875 --> 01:00:02,086
- No, it's not you.

1094
01:00:02,086 --> 01:00:04,771
- Because you know, I mean, I get it,

1095
01:00:04,771 --> 01:00:07,188
there's been shit between us.

1096
01:00:08,830 --> 01:00:11,580
- Yeah but, I'm glad you're here.

1097
01:00:13,954 --> 01:00:18,121
- So uh, what's trying to
push it's way up your colon?

1098
01:00:21,605 --> 01:00:24,354
- I was, I saw some friends last night

1099
01:00:24,354 --> 01:00:27,543
and they treated me like shit.

1100
01:00:27,543 --> 01:00:28,710
- How is that?

1101
01:00:30,286 --> 01:00:33,203
- They just hate my art and they...

1102
01:00:35,174 --> 01:00:37,507
- Alright, you can spill it.

1103
01:00:38,548 --> 01:00:41,236
- Nothing's ever good enough.

1104
01:00:41,236 --> 01:00:43,443
Nothing's ever cool enough.

1105
01:00:43,443 --> 01:00:46,110
- So they're titans of industry?

1106
01:00:47,021 --> 01:00:48,104
- Not really.

1107
01:00:49,275 --> 01:00:51,923
- Well I mean, gotta
be at least one of them

1108
01:00:51,923 --> 01:00:55,057
that's president of the
United States, right?

1109
01:00:55,057 --> 01:00:55,890
- No.

1110
01:00:57,646 --> 01:00:58,479
- Huh.

1111
01:00:59,916 --> 01:01:00,749
Strange.

1112
01:01:02,961 --> 01:01:05,088
- They're really talented though.

1113
01:01:05,088 --> 01:01:08,044
- So talented that they
gotta keep you in your place

1114
01:01:08,044 --> 01:01:12,508
so you don't hold a mirror up
to their bullshit existence.

1115
01:01:12,508 --> 01:01:14,399
- I don't know.

1116
01:01:14,399 --> 01:01:18,025
- Well in the words of a great
poet, they can suck a dick

1117
01:01:18,025 --> 01:01:19,775
up until they hiccup.

1118
01:01:20,937 --> 01:01:23,443
You know I used to have
friends like those, never had

1119
01:01:23,443 --> 01:01:27,610
anything nice to say, always
picking everything apart.

1120
01:01:28,987 --> 01:01:31,479
You know what happened with them?

1121
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:33,299
They're all dead.

1122
01:01:33,299 --> 01:01:36,407
Well not literally, I mean, I don't know.

1123
01:01:36,407 --> 01:01:40,690
But their life sucks so hard
they should be living in

1124
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:42,607
a Taiwanese whorehouse.

1125
01:01:44,275 --> 01:01:46,192
Toxic people, dump 'em.

1126
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:52,283
- You're not wrong.

1127
01:01:57,126 --> 01:01:57,959
You okay?

1128
01:02:02,589 --> 01:02:03,839
- I'm so sorry.

1129
01:02:05,881 --> 01:02:09,072
I know I should have been
there to give you advice,

1130
01:02:09,072 --> 01:02:13,398
and try to make you
laugh when you were hurt.

1131
01:02:13,398 --> 01:02:15,898
God I am such a piece of shit.

1132
01:02:17,711 --> 01:02:21,461
I should have grown up
about the whole thing.

1133
01:02:22,373 --> 01:02:23,373
- It's okay.

1134
01:02:24,234 --> 01:02:28,401
- No it's not, don't make
excuses, stop making excuses.

1135
01:02:29,719 --> 01:02:33,479
I have been making excuses my whole life,

1136
01:02:33,479 --> 01:02:35,729
and it has got to stop now.

1137
01:02:37,004 --> 01:02:38,671
I wanna be your Dad.

1138
01:02:40,841 --> 01:02:42,758
I'm old and I'm broken.

1139
01:02:45,505 --> 01:02:49,672
And I know you shouldn't take
me in, but I'm hoping you

1140
01:02:52,947 --> 01:02:55,614
suffer a lapse in good judgment.

1141
01:02:57,265 --> 01:03:00,015
(sniffles, sobs)

1142
01:03:01,497 --> 01:03:03,914
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

1143
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:09,664
I loved you since the day you were born.

1144
01:03:09,664 --> 01:03:13,444
You came out, I saw that
you were as perfect as your

1145
01:03:13,444 --> 01:03:14,361
mother was.

1146
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:21,867
I just hope you might be willing
to learn to love me back.

1147
01:03:23,804 --> 01:03:26,304
I know I'm late, but I'm here.

1148
01:03:29,194 --> 01:03:33,085
- I'm really glad you called.
- Look I had to.

1149
01:03:33,085 --> 01:03:37,252
Once I realized that someday
I wouldn't be able to.

1150
01:03:39,905 --> 01:03:43,513
I just hope you'll never do
anything like that again.

1151
01:03:43,513 --> 01:03:45,851
- I didn't try to kill myself.

1152
01:03:45,851 --> 01:03:46,768
- Say what?

1153
01:03:47,937 --> 01:03:51,687
- It was an accident,
but nobody believes me.

1154
01:03:52,551 --> 01:03:57,201
I was cleaning my house drunk,
and, the bleach bottle looked

1155
01:03:57,201 --> 01:03:59,595
exactly like the bottle that
my buddy brought over filled

1156
01:03:59,595 --> 01:04:02,156
with this nasty homemade liquor.

1157
01:04:02,156 --> 01:04:06,239
I took a sip and dialed
911 as I was passing out.

1158
01:04:09,349 --> 01:04:11,432
(laughs)

1159
01:04:14,957 --> 01:04:17,290
- That is a hell of a thing.

1160
01:04:20,014 --> 01:04:21,431
- You're not mad?

1161
01:04:22,477 --> 01:04:24,507
- Are you kidding me?

1162
01:04:24,507 --> 01:04:28,188
I'm just glad you didn't
do it on purpose, oh God,

1163
01:04:28,188 --> 01:04:32,892
I haven't done stupid shit
like that in my whole life.

1164
01:04:32,892 --> 01:04:34,975
(laughs)

1165
01:04:38,492 --> 01:04:39,492
You alright?

1166
01:04:40,858 --> 01:04:42,608
- Yeah I'm okay.

1167
01:04:42,608 --> 01:04:43,441
- Good.

1168
01:04:46,627 --> 01:04:50,794
Well, I guess this old man
better get to sleep before he

1169
01:04:51,932 --> 01:04:54,599
blubbers all over you some more.

1170
01:04:55,544 --> 01:04:57,627
- Yeah it's getting late.

1171
01:04:59,674 --> 01:05:00,507
- Hey.

1172
01:05:04,296 --> 01:05:05,713
I love you buddy.

1173
01:05:07,879 --> 01:05:09,296
- I love you too.

1175
01:05:22,716 --> 01:05:25,017
- What are you doing here?

1176
01:05:25,017 --> 01:05:27,635
- Want to kiss and stuff?

1177
01:05:27,635 --> 01:05:28,468
- Yeah.

1178
01:05:29,836 --> 01:05:33,404

here, hold on a second.

1189

1212
01:07:59,741 --> 01:08:02,834
Or we don't have to talk,
we can just sit here and be

1213

hanging out, or if you
want we can watch a movie.

- I can lay in bed and hold
you until you fall asleep?

- I'd really like that.

1217

but I'll stay until then okay?

- Okay.

1219
01:08:39,547 --> 01:08:43,214
- I'll just sneak out
after you fall asleep.

1220
01:08:44,447 --> 01:08:46,422
- I didn't know you had so
much experience sneaking out

1222

01:08:50,706 --> 01:08:51,539
Come here.

1224
01:08:53,562 --> 01:08:55,312
- I wrote you a song.

1225
01:09:02,610 --> 01:09:04,085
I hope you like it.

1226
01:09:04,085 --> 01:09:06,752
(strums guitar)

1227
01:09:11,029 --> 01:09:14,627
♫ Neil's an asshole

1228
01:09:14,627 --> 01:09:17,822
♫ He's a piece of shit

1229
01:09:17,822 --> 01:09:20,409
♫ Neil sucks dick

1230
01:09:20,409 --> 01:09:23,326
♫ He sucks penises

1231
01:09:24,973 --> 01:09:27,647
♫ And I hope he dies

1232
01:09:27,647 --> 01:09:30,909
♫ He needs to die, die, die

1233
01:09:30,909 --> 01:09:34,493
♫ Neil's an asshole

1234
01:09:34,493 --> 01:09:37,687
♫ Neil is Jewish

1235
01:09:37,687 --> 01:09:39,981
♫ And that's not the worst part

1236
01:09:39,981 --> 01:09:44,148
♫ Because he's a fucking asshole ♫

1237
01:09:47,864 --> 01:09:48,697
Thank you!

1238
01:09:49,648 --> 01:09:52,315
(Neil laughing)

1239
01:10:00,106 --> 01:10:02,439
(pats back)

1240
01:10:03,676 --> 01:10:05,157
- I love you.

1241
01:10:05,157 --> 01:10:07,324
(kissing)

1242
01:10:15,685 --> 01:10:17,877
- I love you, buddy.

1243
01:10:17,877 --> 01:10:19,640
- Wasn't such a bad guy.

1244
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:20,473
- I know.

1245
01:10:21,404 --> 01:10:24,574
You should go to the funeral.
- I can't.

1246
01:10:24,574 --> 01:10:25,824
- Sure you can.

1247
01:10:26,752 --> 01:10:30,140
You make your own schedule,
you're a big shot.

1248
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:32,185
- It's too far of a drive.

1249
01:10:32,185 --> 01:10:34,872
- Now don't act like
you couldn't use a trip.

1250
01:10:34,872 --> 01:10:37,602
Drive out there, it'll be good for you.

1251
01:10:37,602 --> 01:10:39,150
I'll even pay for it.

1252
01:10:39,150 --> 01:10:40,868
- I can handle the trip, Mom.

1253
01:10:40,868 --> 01:10:45,035
- Well, at least get a good
dinner while you're gone.

1254
01:10:46,663 --> 01:10:48,707
- You never stop do you?

1255
01:10:48,707 --> 01:10:50,790
- Can't stop, won't stop.

1256
01:10:52,109 --> 01:10:54,870
♫ I hate my hair

1257
01:10:54,870 --> 01:10:57,625
♫ I hate my voice

1258
01:10:57,625 --> 01:11:01,792
♫ But I've no choice
it's what my genes say

1259
01:11:04,443 --> 01:11:07,360
♫ Make me this way

1260
01:11:09,394 --> 01:11:11,911
♫ I guess that's okay

1261
01:11:11,911 --> 01:11:14,683
♫ I like my job

1262
01:11:14,683 --> 01:11:17,427
♫ I like my wife

1263
01:11:17,427 --> 01:11:21,594
♫ This is my life I guess I will stay

1264
01:11:23,769 --> 01:11:27,102
♫ At least one more day

1265
01:11:28,483 --> 01:11:31,055
♫ I guess that's okay

1266
01:11:31,055 --> 01:11:35,222
♫ But there are times
when I wonder if what I do

1267
01:11:36,524 --> 01:11:39,352
♫ Makes a difference to you

1268
01:11:39,352 --> 01:11:41,875
♫ Who are listening

1269
01:11:41,875 --> 01:11:46,042
♫ I've got no kids, I've got no progeny ♫

1270
01:11:52,792 --> 01:11:55,625
(people chatting)

1271
01:12:01,068 --> 01:12:02,151
- Hey lonely.

1272
01:12:03,614 --> 01:12:05,241
- Hi.

1273
01:12:05,241 --> 01:12:06,241
- I'm Linda.

1274
01:12:07,369 --> 01:12:11,536
- I'm Neil, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

1275
01:12:12,943 --> 01:12:14,360
- Rough day, huh?

1276
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:19,591
- Yeah, but, this is supposed
to be rough, so, I guess

1277
01:12:19,591 --> 01:12:20,841
we're on track.

1278
01:12:25,072 --> 01:12:28,322
I have to go check on the kitchen, but,

1279
01:12:32,448 --> 01:12:34,673
you should text me or something.

1280
01:12:34,673 --> 01:12:35,506
- I will.

1281
01:12:43,326 --> 01:12:46,923
- You grieving or just like
eating people's cold cuts?

1282
01:12:46,923 --> 01:12:50,185
- No I,
- I'm just kidding, c'mon man.

1283
01:12:50,185 --> 01:12:52,102
No really, who are you?

1284
01:12:53,167 --> 01:12:56,890
- Eddie was my dad.
- No shit, you're Neil.

1285
01:12:56,890 --> 01:12:57,982
- Yeah.

1286
01:12:57,982 --> 01:12:59,844
- Good to see you man.

1287
01:12:59,844 --> 01:13:01,734
- Yeah.
- Oh, sorry.

1288
01:13:01,734 --> 01:13:02,567
My bad.

1289
01:13:03,570 --> 01:13:05,276
I'll pick that up later.

1290
01:13:05,276 --> 01:13:07,099
Last time I saw you you
were as tall as my dick,

1291
01:13:07,099 --> 01:13:10,404
granted that's pretty tall, but,

1292
01:13:10,404 --> 01:13:12,365
- You saw me back then?

1293
01:13:12,365 --> 01:13:14,895
- Yeah, your dad and I go way
back, we were inseparable,

1294
01:13:14,895 --> 01:13:17,062
we were together for like 30 years.

1295
01:13:17,062 --> 01:13:20,100
Oh and uh, that hot little
number you were talking to,

1296
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:22,466
that's your half sister.

1297
01:13:22,466 --> 01:13:25,129
You might want to stick that
in the old brain computer.

1298
01:13:25,129 --> 01:13:27,314
- I will.
- Yeah, it's a little creepy.

1299
01:13:27,314 --> 01:13:29,372
Eddie uh, come to terms?

1300
01:13:29,372 --> 01:13:31,486
You guys been talking?

1301
01:13:31,486 --> 01:13:34,930
- We started talking, he actually
passed away the day after.

1302
01:13:34,930 --> 01:13:36,597
- Dude I'm so sorry.

1303
01:13:37,778 --> 01:13:39,227
I really am.

1304
01:13:39,227 --> 01:13:40,408
- Thank you.

1305
01:13:40,408 --> 01:13:42,076
- [Man] How long are you in town for?

1306
01:13:42,076 --> 01:13:44,863
- Just until tomorrow.
- No.

1307
01:13:44,863 --> 01:13:47,535
No, stay an extra day,
come hunting with me.

1308
01:13:47,535 --> 01:13:49,538
- I'm not really much of a hunter.

1309
01:13:49,538 --> 01:13:53,934
- Hunting is code for drinking
beer and bullshitting.

1310
01:13:53,934 --> 01:13:55,908
Come on, what do you got to lose?

1311
01:13:55,908 --> 01:13:59,066
Come play with me.
- Alright.

1312
01:13:59,066 --> 01:14:01,418
- Yes, good.
- Okay.

1313
01:14:01,418 --> 01:14:04,416
- You even smell good, God
I can't wait till tomorrow.

1314
01:14:04,416 --> 01:14:05,301
- Yeah.

1315
01:14:05,301 --> 01:14:06,151
- Good.
- Yep.

1316
01:14:06,151 --> 01:14:08,234
- See you then.
- Alright.

1317
01:14:09,689 --> 01:14:12,503
- So I made a lawnmower out of watches.

1318
01:14:12,503 --> 01:14:14,883
It was a waste of time.
- What?

1319
01:14:14,883 --> 01:14:16,216
- Waste of time.

1320
01:14:18,481 --> 01:14:22,600
You know kid, you have what
medical professionals call

1321
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:23,600
a sour puss.

1322
01:14:24,825 --> 01:14:27,569
I'm trying to break it for you.

1323
01:14:27,569 --> 01:14:28,652
So loosen up.

1324
01:14:30,369 --> 01:14:31,202
So.

1325
01:14:32,189 --> 01:14:34,272
You twist it, just twist.

1326
01:14:35,549 --> 01:14:39,274
There you go, so, there's two
guys on the train, they've

1327
01:14:39,274 --> 01:14:43,441
been eating clams all day, clams
are bad, I mean really bad.

1328
01:14:45,125 --> 01:14:48,402
Well it finally hit the
first guy right in the gut.

1329
01:14:48,402 --> 01:14:50,992
He's gotta go, so he heads
right to the bathroom, starts

1330
01:14:50,992 --> 01:14:53,442
shitting his guts out.

1331
01:14:53,442 --> 01:14:56,242
Just as that happens, clams
hit the other guy just like

1332
01:14:56,242 --> 01:14:59,732
punch him right in the colon,
like donkey punch him right

1333
01:14:59,732 --> 01:15:01,473
in the butt hole, right?

1334
01:15:01,473 --> 01:15:03,797
He's gotta go, he ain't got
no place to go because the

1335
01:15:03,797 --> 01:15:05,561
other guy's in the bathroom,
what's he gonna do?

1336
01:15:05,561 --> 01:15:08,289
Drops his drawers, sticks
his ass right out the window,

1337
01:15:08,289 --> 01:15:11,956
just as he sticks his
ass out of the window,

1338
01:15:14,295 --> 01:15:16,647
train goes by two hobos.

1339
01:15:16,647 --> 01:15:19,334
This guy starts shitting his
guts out the back, out the

1340
01:15:19,334 --> 01:15:21,813
window, one hobo looks at
the other and goes "Frank,

1341
01:15:21,813 --> 01:15:26,246
"I thought you could chew
tobacco, Jesus Christ."

1342
01:15:26,246 --> 01:15:27,884
- Oh my God.

1343
01:15:27,884 --> 01:15:29,116
(chuckles)

1344
01:15:29,116 --> 01:15:30,208
- See?

1345
01:15:30,208 --> 01:15:31,589
I knew you were a sick son
of a bitch just like your

1346
01:15:31,589 --> 01:15:32,919
old man.

1347
01:15:32,919 --> 01:15:36,086
This wildlife ain't gonna kill itself.

1348
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:44,043
(insects buzz, foliage shuffles)

1349
01:15:50,518 --> 01:15:52,751
You remember the dog?

1350
01:15:52,751 --> 01:15:53,838
- The dog?

1351
01:15:53,838 --> 01:15:54,671
- Yeah.

1352
01:15:54,671 --> 01:15:57,921
Back in the day, your dad had, careful.

1353
01:16:01,004 --> 01:16:04,437
Back in the day, your
dad had to get around,

1354
01:16:04,437 --> 01:16:05,312
he couldn't have you right

1355
01:16:05,312 --> 01:16:08,539
on the back of the bike,
you were too small.

1356
01:16:08,539 --> 01:16:11,241
So he got a bungee cord and
he strapped you to his chest.

1357
01:16:11,241 --> 01:16:14,241
Kind of like a papoose or something.

1358
01:16:15,187 --> 01:16:17,677
Then he'd go riding the bike,
the two of you together,

1359
01:16:17,677 --> 01:16:20,800
that way he could safely get you around.

1360
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,679
- That sounds real safe.

1361
01:16:22,679 --> 01:16:23,929
- It's the 80s.

1362
01:16:24,917 --> 01:16:27,101
We didn't know kids could die yet.

1363
01:16:27,101 --> 01:16:30,573
Anyways, so you dad's out
riding and he's got you

1364
01:16:30,573 --> 01:16:33,878
strapped to his chest and he hits a dog.

1365
01:16:33,878 --> 01:16:36,709
Now your dad being who he is,
he didn't think it was right

1366
01:16:36,709 --> 01:16:39,966
just to leave a dog laying in the road.

1367
01:16:39,966 --> 01:16:43,340
So he took it upon himself to
scoop the dog up and go door

1368
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:46,672
to door trying to find
out who owned the dog.

1369
01:16:46,672 --> 01:16:48,715
- That's really great of him.

1370
01:16:48,715 --> 01:16:51,148
- Yeah.
(chuckles)

1371
01:16:51,148 --> 01:16:53,593
Yeah could you imagine the
big biker standing on your

1372
01:16:53,593 --> 01:16:55,653
doorstep, bloody dog in
his hand and a kid strapped

1373
01:16:55,653 --> 01:16:57,196
to his chest?

1374
01:16:57,196 --> 01:16:59,169
I mean, what a sight.

1375
01:16:59,169 --> 01:17:01,658
I'm surprised they didn't
call the cops on him.

1376
01:17:01,658 --> 01:17:03,030
- Probably too afraid to.

1377
01:17:03,030 --> 01:17:03,947
- Probably.

1378
01:17:11,246 --> 01:17:12,079
You go.

1379
01:17:15,950 --> 01:17:18,783
(heavy breathing)

1380
01:17:23,370 --> 01:17:25,651
Ever hear the story about
your old man's finger?

1381
01:17:25,651 --> 01:17:27,752
It's this finger, you know this finger?

1382
01:17:27,752 --> 01:17:29,488
- I'm familiar with that,
- Right here?

1383
01:17:29,488 --> 01:17:30,818
- I don't know the story, yep.

1384
01:17:30,818 --> 01:17:35,437
- Well, this one night your
dad and I in the garage,

1385
01:17:35,437 --> 01:17:38,854
and your dad's got his head to the motor,

1386
01:17:40,086 --> 01:17:42,336
and some idiot turns it on.

1387
01:17:43,921 --> 01:17:44,754
Wasn't me.

1388
01:17:46,175 --> 01:17:50,140
Anyway, cuts his finger clean
off, I mean, it disappears

1389
01:17:50,140 --> 01:17:53,241
and we can't find it, we look everywhere.

1390
01:17:53,241 --> 01:17:55,649
And then finally your dad's
like look, I have to go to

1391
01:17:55,649 --> 01:17:59,882
the hospital, and I'm like,
I promise I will keep looking

1392
01:17:59,882 --> 01:18:03,006
for your finger until I find it.

1393
01:18:03,006 --> 01:18:03,839
- Did you?

1394
01:18:05,888 --> 01:18:09,154
- Yeah, it was sitting on a
shelf about four feet off the

1395
01:18:09,154 --> 01:18:12,794
ground just all nice and
pretty like it belonged there,

1396
01:18:12,794 --> 01:18:15,915
just chilling, just hanging out.

1397
01:18:15,915 --> 01:18:19,414
Had to stop by McDonald's
and stick it in a cup of ice,

1398
01:18:19,414 --> 01:18:20,744
should have seen the
girl behind the counter,

1399
01:18:20,744 --> 01:18:21,807
she freaked out.

1400
01:18:21,807 --> 01:18:23,628
Had to take it to the
hospital for your Dad.

1401
01:18:23,628 --> 01:18:24,971
- You guys had some times.

1402
01:18:24,971 --> 01:18:25,804
- Yeah.

1403
01:18:27,127 --> 01:18:28,960
Had the best of times.

1404
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
- This is such bullshit.

1405
01:18:35,472 --> 01:18:38,243
- We all gotta die, kid.

1406
01:18:38,243 --> 01:18:40,371
- Yeah but right when
we start talking again,

1407
01:18:40,371 --> 01:18:42,965
and on my fucking couch, man.

1408
01:18:42,965 --> 01:18:44,590
- Yeah, I know.

1409
01:18:44,590 --> 01:18:45,423
I'm sorry.

1410
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:51,207
- The same year my fucking
girlfriend leaves me, and,

1411
01:18:52,779 --> 01:18:56,110
I just feel like a piece
of shit all the time.

1412
01:18:56,110 --> 01:18:58,056
- You see that?

1413
01:18:58,056 --> 01:18:59,414
That right there?

1414
01:18:59,414 --> 01:19:01,081
That's your problem.

1415
01:19:02,018 --> 01:19:06,185
You gotta live with the fact
that nothing good ever happens.

1416
01:19:08,635 --> 01:19:10,787
- Thanks, I feel a lot better now.

1417
01:19:10,787 --> 01:19:12,608
- The universe doesn't give a shit.

1418
01:19:12,608 --> 01:19:16,388
The universe doesn't know good and bad.

1419
01:19:16,388 --> 01:19:18,880
We're the ones that know good and bad.

1420
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:21,833
You have to make good things
happen, and you have to

1421
01:19:21,833 --> 01:19:24,250
appreciate them when they do.

1422
01:19:25,739 --> 01:19:29,906
You're responsible for
yourself, so grow the fuck up.

1423
01:19:30,785 --> 01:19:32,821
You understand?

1424
01:19:32,821 --> 01:19:34,907
Make good things happen.

1425
01:19:34,907 --> 01:19:38,658
And have the balls to
appreciate them when they do.

1426
01:19:38,658 --> 01:19:40,241
Your dad knew that.

1427
01:19:51,403 --> 01:19:54,320
(knocking on door)

1428
01:20:00,968 --> 01:20:03,895
- I know this is weird, but, um,

1429
01:20:03,895 --> 01:20:06,024
could I possibly use your restroom?

1430
01:20:06,024 --> 01:20:08,320
- I'm sorry, I don't do that.

1431
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:11,289
- Well maybe, I can explain
why I'm like this and how

1432
01:20:11,289 --> 01:20:13,781
uncomfortable this is, I
know it's an uncomfortable

1433
01:20:13,781 --> 01:20:17,211
situation, down the street
here I'm a clown, I was doing a

1434
01:20:17,211 --> 01:20:20,850
children's party and this
little monster, I'm sorry,

1435
01:20:20,850 --> 01:20:24,910
your neighbor insisted that
I share a hot dog with her.

1436
01:20:24,910 --> 01:20:28,714
And being a vegan it's done
horrible things to my intestinal

1437
01:20:28,714 --> 01:20:32,881
tract, if you could, just be
a pal and just for second,

1438
01:20:35,860 --> 01:20:37,664
just for a second let me use the facility?

1439
01:20:37,664 --> 01:20:39,540
I can show you my ID.

1440
01:20:39,540 --> 01:20:42,103
- Fine, do whatever, it's fine.

1441
01:20:42,103 --> 01:20:43,704
(door creaks)

1442
01:20:43,704 --> 01:20:46,537
- Oh thank you, thank you so much.

1443
01:20:52,398 --> 01:20:55,815
Hey dude, dude, you got any toilet paper?

1444
01:20:57,756 --> 01:21:00,839
- Yeah I just got some hold on a sec.

1445
01:21:03,090 --> 01:21:05,648
Oh dude, what the fuck?

1446
01:21:05,648 --> 01:21:08,768
- Hey, I'm sorry, I'm like
viciously claustrophobic,

1447
01:21:08,768 --> 01:21:10,888
I have to leave the door open.

1448
01:21:10,888 --> 01:21:12,995
But if you want me ever out of here

1449
01:21:12,995 --> 01:21:14,773
then please just pass the TP.

1450
01:21:14,773 --> 01:21:16,316
(clown grunts)

1451
01:21:16,316 --> 01:21:19,788
Oh nice hand off, thank you
so much, thank you so much.

1452
01:21:19,788 --> 01:21:21,455
Hey, dude, you okay?

1453
01:21:22,702 --> 01:21:25,418
- Yeah, I mean, besides this whole thing.

1454
01:21:25,418 --> 01:21:28,920
- You kind of look a little
bleary eyed, like bloodshot.

1455
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:31,165
- I'm fine, I just really
don't want to talk about it

1456
01:21:31,165 --> 01:21:32,144
like this.

1457
01:21:32,144 --> 01:21:34,688
- I'm sorry, I never met
anybody who didn't poop before.

1458
01:21:34,688 --> 01:21:35,879
(laughs)

1459
01:21:35,879 --> 01:21:37,559
You ought to be in the
Guinness Book of World Records

1460
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:39,000
or something for that one.

1461
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,919
Really, you're not looking
too good, I, you know,

1462
01:21:40,919 --> 01:21:43,495
I read people for a living,
if anything I can do to

1463
01:21:43,495 --> 01:21:47,611
be of assistance here, I can
be like, think of my as your

1464
01:21:47,611 --> 01:21:50,228
poop priest doing a confessional
for you and, (laughs)

1465
01:21:50,228 --> 01:21:55,111
come on, spill your guts
while I spill mine. (farts)

1466
01:21:55,111 --> 01:21:57,280
- I'm fine, things just
haven't been panning out.

1467
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:58,666
- Well what's bothering you man?

1468
01:21:58,666 --> 01:22:02,010
Is it like, (farts) boyfriend
problems, girlfriend problems?

1469
01:22:02,010 --> 01:22:04,883
- No, why'd you say boyfriend first?

1470
01:22:04,883 --> 01:22:07,346
- You have to find something
bigger to love than that, man,

1471
01:22:07,346 --> 01:22:09,418
that's how you find happiness.

1472
01:22:09,418 --> 01:22:11,139
Before I realized I was a performer,

1473
01:22:11,139 --> 01:22:13,000
I used to sell insurance.

1474
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,433
And it was okay, you know,
it paid pretty good, but,

1475
01:22:16,433 --> 01:22:20,185
I woke up every just so goddamn sad.

1476
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:23,026
You have anything in your
life that you could just wrap

1477
01:22:23,026 --> 01:22:25,628
your heart around and
get into and hold onto

1478
01:22:25,628 --> 01:22:27,098
as like an anchor?

1479
01:22:27,098 --> 01:22:29,731
- I mean, I paint and I draw.

1480
01:22:29,731 --> 01:22:32,236
- Well there you go, that's kind of cool.

1481
01:22:32,236 --> 01:22:33,499
- Yeah, but I do it for a living,

1482
01:22:33,499 --> 01:22:35,498
and it kind of gets a little mundane.

1483
01:22:35,498 --> 01:22:38,089
- You just gotta ask yourself
two questions in life.

1484
01:22:38,089 --> 01:22:40,007
Speaking of number 2,
(farts)

1485
01:22:40,007 --> 01:22:43,798
will doing what you love make you happy?

1486
01:22:43,798 --> 01:22:44,881
- I guess so.

1487
01:22:45,870 --> 01:22:48,444
- Well then the next question
is that, do you want to

1488
01:22:48,444 --> 01:22:49,277
be happy?

1489
01:22:54,094 --> 01:22:57,278
Man seriously, thanks, you
saved my, don't worry, I washed

1490
01:22:57,278 --> 01:22:59,146
my hands by the way.
- I know, I saw,

1491
01:22:59,146 --> 01:23:01,778
and thank you.
- Thank you so much, man.

1492
01:23:01,778 --> 01:23:03,081
All in a day's work.

1493
01:23:03,081 --> 01:23:04,214
(horn toots)

1494
01:23:04,214 --> 01:23:07,118
By the way, you've got mail.

1495
01:23:07,118 --> 01:23:08,118
- Thank you.

1496
01:23:22,537 --> 01:23:23,370
Yes, yes.

1497
01:23:31,259 --> 01:23:33,771
- So, are you going to tell me

1498
01:23:33,771 --> 01:23:36,487
why you missed our last appointment?

1499
01:23:36,487 --> 01:23:38,545
- I went to the funeral.

1500
01:23:38,545 --> 01:23:40,224
- For your father?

1501
01:23:40,224 --> 01:23:41,555
- Yeah.

1502
01:23:41,555 --> 01:23:43,361
- How did it make you feel?

1503
01:23:43,361 --> 01:23:45,433
- How do you think it made me feel?

1504
01:23:45,433 --> 01:23:46,266
- Better?

1505
01:23:48,474 --> 01:23:50,253
- Yeah, it did.

1506
01:23:50,253 --> 01:23:53,951
- I'm glad to hear that, is
there something else on your

1507
01:23:53,951 --> 01:23:57,562
mind that's putting you in a bad mood?

1508
01:23:57,562 --> 01:23:59,340
- I can't stop thinking about the guys.

1509
01:23:59,340 --> 01:24:01,495
I just always thought they
were here for me, and now

1510
01:24:01,495 --> 01:24:03,162
I really don't know.

1511
01:24:05,163 --> 01:24:07,163
- Let's try an exercise.

1512
01:24:08,747 --> 01:24:11,715
Pretend I'm your friends
that have hurt you.

1513
01:24:11,715 --> 01:24:14,698
Say to me what you want to say to them.

1514
01:24:14,698 --> 01:24:16,503
- Isn't that something you
do with eight year olds?

1515
01:24:16,503 --> 01:24:19,095
- I can give you a juice box afterward.

1516
01:24:19,095 --> 01:24:23,770
Just try it, just open your
mouth and let it come out.

1517
01:24:23,770 --> 01:24:25,270
- Well I'm pissed.

1518
01:24:26,359 --> 01:24:28,964
Come into my life and then
judge everything about it.

1519
01:24:28,964 --> 01:24:32,520
- Well, you do stupid things,
like try to kill yourself.

1520
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:34,103
- I didn't...

1521
01:24:34,103 --> 01:24:36,603
- They are saying this to you.

1522
01:24:38,207 --> 01:24:40,685
- Why would you notice?

1523
01:24:40,685 --> 01:24:43,768
When I was low, when I was depressed.

1524
01:24:45,490 --> 01:24:48,073
When I couldn't get out of bed.

1525
01:24:50,587 --> 01:24:52,087
You laughed at me.

1526
01:24:52,938 --> 01:24:57,105
You made fun of me because
I couldn't get shit done.

1527
01:25:00,798 --> 01:25:04,465
You didn't think I heard
about it but I did.

1528
01:25:07,325 --> 01:25:08,742
So what did I do?

1529
01:25:09,944 --> 01:25:10,777
I got up.

1530
01:25:14,844 --> 01:25:19,352
And now you hate me
because I'm doing too much.

1531
01:25:19,352 --> 01:25:20,352
I can't win.

1532
01:25:25,246 --> 01:25:28,913
I pick myself up on my
own, and that's fine.

1533
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:34,610
But I don't deserve to die.

1534
01:25:37,888 --> 01:25:39,805
I don't deserve to die.

1535
01:25:43,165 --> 01:25:44,165
So fuck you.

1536
01:25:45,238 --> 01:25:46,071
Fuck off.

1537
01:25:48,255 --> 01:25:51,293
Because I got everything I need.

1538
01:25:51,293 --> 01:25:53,840
- Don't give them what you just gave me.

1539
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:55,914
They don't deserve it.

1540
01:25:55,914 --> 01:25:56,747
- Right.

1541
01:25:57,958 --> 01:26:01,708
- Is there anything else
you need to get out?

1542
01:26:12,155 --> 01:26:14,233
- Hey.
- Hey, what brings you here?

1543
01:26:14,233 --> 01:26:15,718
- I just need to talk to you real quick.

1544
01:26:15,718 --> 01:26:16,893
- Sure.

1545
01:26:16,893 --> 01:26:18,559
- You're a great friend.

1546
01:26:18,559 --> 01:26:21,619
And I think about you all the time.

1547
01:26:21,619 --> 01:26:25,976
So I think we should go out to
make a lot of sense together.

1548
01:26:25,976 --> 01:26:28,090
- I really appreciate that.

1549
01:26:28,090 --> 01:26:30,794
But I like us as friends.

1550
01:26:30,794 --> 01:26:34,616
Not really looking for
anything more than that.

1551
01:26:34,616 --> 01:26:35,949
- You know what?

1552
01:26:37,224 --> 01:26:38,057
It's okay.

1553
01:26:39,338 --> 01:26:41,501
- You gonna be okay?

1554
01:26:41,501 --> 01:26:44,511
- Yeah, I just better get going.

1555
01:26:44,511 --> 01:26:46,975
- Sorry, I didn't mean
to hurt your feelings.

1556
01:26:46,975 --> 01:26:48,558
- I really am okay.

1557
01:26:49,524 --> 01:26:52,869
Being friends with you is a
pretty great consolation prize.

1558
01:26:52,869 --> 01:26:54,493
I just got some important
stuff I gotta take care of

1559
01:26:54,493 --> 01:26:56,089
so I'll talk to you later okay?

1560
01:26:56,089 --> 01:26:57,797
- Take care.

1561
01:26:57,797 --> 01:27:00,630
(whimsical music)

1562
01:27:04,755 --> 01:27:06,224
No excuses.

1563
01:27:06,224 --> 01:27:10,391
♫ How do you do what you do
after dealing with what's done

1564
01:27:13,546 --> 01:27:17,937
♫ Smiling statues standing ground

1565
01:27:17,937 --> 01:27:22,181
♫ While I turn tail and run

1566
01:27:22,181 --> 01:27:26,348
♫ How do you do what you
do with the trap cards

1567
01:27:27,753 --> 01:27:30,525
♫ You're dealt

1568
01:27:30,525 --> 01:27:34,692
♫ Turning deuces into kings
while dealers bite the felt

1569
01:27:39,259 --> 01:27:43,516
♫ Oh no not me I can barely talk

1570
01:27:43,516 --> 01:27:45,616
♫ Oh no not me

1571
01:27:45,616 --> 01:27:46,927
♫ I can't chew the book ♫

1572
01:27:46,927 --> 01:27:48,523
(pounding on door)

1573
01:27:48,523 --> 01:27:49,523
- It's open.

1574
01:27:50,470 --> 01:27:51,940
(door creaks)

1575
01:27:51,940 --> 01:27:54,557
- I'm gonna need a tip for
delivering in this neighborhood.

1576
01:27:54,557 --> 01:27:56,336
(chuckles)

1577
01:27:56,336 --> 01:27:57,693
- Hey how's it going man?

1578
01:27:57,693 --> 01:27:58,757
Is it done?

1579
01:27:58,757 --> 01:28:00,424
- Yeah, have a look.

1580
01:28:03,575 --> 01:28:04,492
Is it good?

1581
01:28:05,330 --> 01:28:07,245
- What do you mean is it good?

1582
01:28:07,245 --> 01:28:09,828
Oh my God, dude, this is great.

1583
01:28:10,816 --> 01:28:12,844
- I think you're just asking
to be a dick, you know you

1584
01:28:12,844 --> 01:28:14,844
can paint good and shit.

1585
01:28:19,130 --> 01:28:21,524
- Hey do you guys mind
if we watch Breaking Bad?

1586
01:28:21,524 --> 01:28:24,263
I've kind of been rewatching it.

1587
01:28:24,263 --> 01:28:26,463
- Yeah.
- Whatever man.

1588
01:28:26,463 --> 01:28:28,099
- Hey you got any drink?

1589
01:28:28,099 --> 01:28:30,432
- Yeah in the fridge.
- Cool.

1590
01:28:34,396 --> 01:28:37,699
(acoustic guitar music)

1591
01:28:37,699 --> 01:28:41,449
♫ It's much more comfortable

1592
01:28:43,598 --> 01:28:46,763
♫ My fingers are not much
to be happy with a dollar

1593
01:28:46,763 --> 01:28:50,552
♫ This is not a time to be
overly impressed or proud

1594
01:28:50,552 --> 01:28:53,938
♫ These are not the lyrics you
were hoping I'd scribble down

1595
01:28:53,938 --> 01:28:57,186
♫ Everything sounds so
sweet until it's on the page

1596
01:28:57,186 --> 01:29:00,336
♫ Oh everything sounds
amazing until you're living it

1597
01:29:00,336 --> 01:29:04,956
♫ But it's another city
with nothing to eat

1598
01:29:04,956 --> 01:29:09,251
♫ It's another town with
nowhwere but my car to sleep

1599
01:29:09,251 --> 01:29:11,956
♫ It doesn't sound so ridiculous
until I say it out loud

1600
01:29:11,956 --> 01:29:15,275
♫ Everything sounds so strange
when I try to explain it

1601
01:29:15,275 --> 01:29:18,680
♫ Oh everything sounds this
crazy until you're living it

1602
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:19,952
♫ But I'm highly adaptable

1603
01:29:19,952 --> 01:29:22,119
♫ Dum, dum, dum, dum

1604
01:29:22,119 --> 01:29:23,623
♫ And I wear this guilt like a medal

1605
01:29:23,623 --> 01:29:25,469
♫ Da da dum, da da dum

1606
01:29:25,469 --> 01:29:29,366
♫ No, no, there is no problem

1607
01:29:29,366 --> 01:29:31,390
♫ It's just that everything
sounds self destructive

1608
01:29:31,390 --> 01:29:34,307
♫ Until you see it

1609
01:29:35,734 --> 01:29:39,294
♫ Finally seen that
look on strangers faces

1610
01:29:39,294 --> 01:29:41,863
♫ And I'm doing my best
not to crack a smile

1611
01:29:41,863 --> 01:29:44,446
♫ Because maybe I get
a little satisfaction

1612
01:29:44,446 --> 01:29:46,237
♫ Being looked down on

1613
01:29:46,237 --> 01:29:49,053
♫ Like a fuck up, like a piece of trash

1614
01:29:49,053 --> 01:29:52,405
♫ Because god fucking
dammit I know what I am

1615
01:29:52,405 --> 01:29:53,517
♫ And I like to be right, yeah

1616
01:29:53,517 --> 01:29:56,194
♫ Da da dum, da da dum

1617
01:29:56,194 --> 01:29:58,052
♫ And I wear this guilt like a medal

1618
01:29:58,052 --> 01:29:59,357
♫ Da da dum, da da dum

1619
01:29:59,357 --> 01:30:03,317
♫ No, no, there is no problem

1620
01:30:03,317 --> 01:30:05,575
♫ It's just that everything
sounds self destructive

1621
01:30:05,575 --> 01:30:08,492
♫ until you see it

1622
01:30:09,534 --> 01:30:11,249
♫ And the days pass like seconds

1623
01:30:11,249 --> 01:30:12,862
♫ And the nights, they take years

1624
01:30:12,862 --> 01:30:16,662
♫ And your voice is
thousands of miles away

1625
01:30:16,662 --> 01:30:20,829
♫ And I wish I didn't have
to keep explaining myself

1626
01:30:21,718 --> 01:30:26,214
♫ Like this it wanes my confidence

1627
01:30:26,214 --> 01:30:28,902
♫ I wish it weren't the truth

1628
01:30:28,902 --> 01:30:31,710
♫ I don't believe in myself

1629
01:30:31,710 --> 01:30:36,662
♫ I'm afraid that I
don't believe in myself

1630
01:30:36,662 --> 01:30:38,367
♫ It doesn't actually matter what

1631
01:30:38,367 --> 01:30:40,598
♫ The lyrics to the song even are

1632
01:30:40,598 --> 01:30:45,174
♫ If I don't believe in myself

1633
01:30:45,174 --> 01:30:48,086
♫ Then how can I expect any better?

1634
01:30:48,086 --> 01:30:49,494
♫ Two, three, four

1635
01:30:49,494 --> 01:30:52,430
♫ Da da dum, da da dum

1636
01:30:52,430 --> 01:30:54,246
♫ And I wear this guilt like a medal

1637
01:30:54,246 --> 01:30:56,773
♫ Da da dum, da da dum

1638
01:30:56,773 --> 01:31:00,461
♫ I swear I'm doing alright

1639
01:31:00,461 --> 01:31:02,477
♫ It's just that
everything sounds so fresh

1640
01:31:02,477 --> 01:31:04,909
♫ When I open my mouth

1641
01:31:04,909 --> 01:31:06,257
♫ And everything seems so alright

1642
01:31:06,257 --> 01:31:08,781
♫ When no one's around.

1643
01:31:08,781 --> 01:31:12,606
♫ Everything is just perfect

1644
01:31:12,606 --> 01:31:15,342
♫ I promise

1645
01:31:15,342 --> 01:31:19,709
♫ How I wish that were true

1646
01:31:19,709 --> 01:31:22,042
- Miracles happen every day.
