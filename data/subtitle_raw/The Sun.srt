1
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:41,370
Early 21st century

2
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,370
More than half of humans died due to infection

3
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:54,920
And the humans that barely survived...

4
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:54,920
Divided into two groups

5
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,110
Very shortly...

6
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,220
 Everyone who is out of the CURIO area, please return immediately.

7
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,290
Very shortly...

8
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:06,390
Everyone who is out of the CURIO area, please return immediately.

9
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,920
Very shortly...

10
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,830
Everyone who is out of the CURIO area, please return immediately.

11
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,460
Very shortly...

12
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,700
Everyone who is out of the CURIO area, please return immediately

13
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,330
Very shortly...

14
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:41,660
Everyone who is out of the CURIO are, please return immediately.

15
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,280
Katsuya!

16
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,260
Why are you doing this?

17
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:54,400
Hey...speak to me Katsuya!

18
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,410
You sure are worthy of being a NOX member.

19
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,130
Will you be okay if your head gets smashed in?

20
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,360
Didn't I tell you that we were friends?

21
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,050
Why are you doing this?

22
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:18,150
Didn't you say that you wanted to talk and be on good terms?

23
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,400
But you never gave me a chance you bastard.

24
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,770
You look down on us don't you?

25
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,580
You're drinking alcohol aren't you?

26
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,930
You can't do that Katsuya!

27
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,560
You can't make good judgments in that state...

28
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,110
Shut up!

29
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,020
That's dangerous you bastard!

30
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,190
Don't spread it to me!

31
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,210
Katsuya...

32
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,730
We can coexist!

33
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,470
Didn't we make a promise that we'd go home together?

34
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:28,750
Katsuya!

35
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,330
Katsuya!

36
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,950
Thanks to you, we have to endure such a shitty lifestyle.

37
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:54,510
My grandparents and my parents as well...

38
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:02,320
Things must be changed by our generation.

39
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:05,360
Katsuya...

40
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,270
Hey, stop it!

41
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,330
Please stop!

42
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,830
I'm not a slave of NOX!

43
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,170
I'm a child of the Sun!

44
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:14,350
We found it! It's right here!

45
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:17,920
Over here! Over here!

46
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:19,780
It's right here!

47
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,180
Take a look!

48
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,070
How could this happen?

49
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,190
Dad!

50
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,780
Dad!

51
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:37,840
Don't look!

52
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:38,810
Don't look!

53
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,340
Where is Katsuya?

54
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:41,790
Go look for him!

55
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:02,560
Katsuya! What have you done?

56
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,190
Is that you Onee-chan?

57
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,220
He was your friend...

58
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,580
I can't stand NOX!

59
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,190
Turn yourself in. Please!

60
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,020
What are you saying?

61
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,330
The village will be destroyed! Please!

62
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,910
I'm going to Shikoku! It's a revolution!

63
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,790
This isn't only your village!

64
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,070
Onee-chan!

65
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,590
Don't you want to live a nice life?

66
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,300
We're both humans!

67
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,530
Katsuya!

68
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,290
Katsuya!

69
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,200
Katsuya!

70
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:03,980
Damn you!

71
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:05,730
Damn you!

72
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,790
What have you done?

73
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,850
This is because of your stupid little brother!

74
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,340
It's over!

75
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,460
How are you gong to take responsibility for this!?

76
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,630
This village is done for!

77
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,200
What are you doing?!

78
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,260
Junko can't do anything about it!

79
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,400
Hey! This village is done for!

80
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,940
Stop wasting time and look for him!

81
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:37,920
It's on fire!

82
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,320
It's on fire. Alright! Let's go!

83
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,260
It's dangerous! Get back!

84
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,250
Step back! It's dangerous!

85
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:04,260
Decades ago when people died of the new virus infection...

86
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:08,000
The people who stumbled upon the antibodies became NOX.

87
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:11,860
They lived a totally different life then us.

88
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,710
We're different than NOX.

89
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,570
We will die once we are infected.

90
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,570
Although these differences exist...

91
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,510
Humans aren't based off what their parents did.

92
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,620
We can't be treated differently at birth.

93
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,910
We and NOX are equal.

94
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,130
Sounds good?

95
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,680
Although it's a little far from here...

96
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:40,060
There are people who live well without depending on NOX in Shikoku.

97
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,580
I talked about the autonomous region before.

98
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,090
I already explained it but...

99
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,320
Can anyone else explain it?

100
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,220
Me!

101
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,410
Alright, what about Takahashi?

102
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:59,430
Loud and clear!

103
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,190
They don't rely on Nox...

104
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,010
What do they do if they don't rely on them?

105
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,310
Me!

106
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,520
You can't answer?

107
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,240
You can't rely on these girls to answer for you.

108
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,380
What do they do if they don't relay on NOX?

109
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,150
Okay!

110
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,750
Okay...let's see..

111
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:29,010
They have their own law administration.

112
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,760
What is this administration?

113
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:34,970
Me!

114
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,470
Alright...how about...

115
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,990
-They're here! -You're right!

116
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,570
Really?

117
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,480
-It's my mom! -No way!

118
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,680
Alright! You can go home when you return the textbooks!

119
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:53,950
Okay!!

120
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:58,430
-Hayase-san will teach math tomorrow.  -Okay!

121
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,480
-Farewell! -Don't drop anything and be safe on your way home!

122
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,870
Okay!!

123
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,240
Nox school's have activities like exercise and work right?

124
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,040
That equality is a lie isn't it?

125
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,370
You're late!

126
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,820
Your Dad's ethic class is too long!

127
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,800
Your mom isn't going to come?

128
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:26,140
At 8pm, we have a special announcement in the government Palace!

129
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:31,580
People over 20 years old, please come to the meeting place! Thank you!

130
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:37,490
NOX people will come at 8pm!

131
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:40,520
Please come to the meeting place everyone!

132
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,890
Best regards!

133
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:37,540
Yes!

134
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,010
I have just arrived.

135
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:42,910
Yeah.

136
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,710
That isn't a problem.

137
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,160
Yes.

138
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,200
Dad! Are they coming?

139
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:19,710
They're just in time.

140
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,030
We might get busy in the future.

141
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,030
Yes! Good work!

142
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,990
To be honest, I was shocked!

143
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,300
The past 10 years of economic blockade has been so awful.

144
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:53,850
Someone just recently died right?

145
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:00,300
There's 44 people now.

146
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,360
10 years ago, there were 307 people.

147
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,700
Is everyone in Shikoku?

148
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,330
Some people did...yeah.

149
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,880
They simply abandon their hometown if the economy does bad.

150
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,040
It's not their fault.

151
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,770
Okudera Junko-san!

152
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:30,930
Your little brother killed a NOX member.

153
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:37,850
His family has finally forgiven your brother's crimes.

154
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,960
Please be grateful!

155
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:42,410
This is a special case.

156
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,050
It's because of the generosity of his family.

157
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,530
Please be grateful!

158
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:55,010
I hope you can respond to me.

159
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:58,010
Be grateful or apologize. Either one is fine.

160
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,310
It's rude to let me speak alone.

161
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,930
Thank you...

162
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,060
Speak up. Put some volume in that voice.

163
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,070
-Thank you  -Louder!

164
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,770
-Thank you. -Louder!

165
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,050
-Thank you! -Louder!

166
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,100
Thank you!

167
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,370
Thanks for that.

168
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,130
They're saying something to Junko-san.

169
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,940
Shit! Why is it just the adults?

170
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:44,900
But wow, it must be really hard for you to survive in this environment?

171
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:48,240
In our opinion, it is in a primitive era.

172
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,340
Let's start with infrastructure first!

173
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:52,880
We will also provide medical support.

174
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:58,750
Also..if your child is under 20, please raise your hand.

175
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:09,220
After 10 years, the lottery for conversion surgery will be carried out again.

176
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,810
I will send the application materials to everyone later.

177
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,800
Now then! It's time for a new beginning!

178
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,370
Let's return back to the cultural age.

179
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,550
Have a seat.

180
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,810
The boy over there! Look straight!

181
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,480
Let's shake hands as a sign of reconciliation, Okudera-san.

182
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:53,390
I'll publish the photo in the newspaper.

183
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,930
Look forward.

184
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,650
It's okay. You can't catch anything with a handshake.

185
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,690
Please get a good shot!

186
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,190
Okay!

187
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,330
I'm taking it!

188
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,140
Damn, that's bright!

189
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,440
What was that?

190
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,220
NOX people are weak to light.

191
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:17,410
Now then! We will give you the medicine for the virus.

192
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,410
This is medicine for preventing the infection.

193
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,170
Alright, I'll have the 6 of you come follow me over here.

194
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,940
Go ahead.

195
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:34,040
Please take off your jacket and stand in line here.

196
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,310
Alright! Over here!

197
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,480
Please take off your jacket and come over here.

198
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:41,610
Please take off your jacket and stand side by side in front of the bar.

199
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,090
Please take off your jacket and stand side by side in front of the bar.

200
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,990
We're going to spray you with medicine to prevent the infection.

201
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,950
Here we go!

202
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,950
Please come over here.

203
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,770
Please take off your jacket and stand side by side in front of the bar.

204
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,490
Over here!

205
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,100
Please take off your jacket and stand side by side in front of the bar.

206
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,050
Okay! The next person please!

207
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:20,930
Please take off your jacket and stand side by side in front of the bar.

208
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,580
Please stand side by side in front of this bar.

209
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:30,090
Please stand side by side in front of this bar.

210
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,660
Alright, here we go!

211
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,390
Alright, that's it!

212
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:56,250
Alright, for those of you in front, please come over here for a simple check.

213
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:56,880
The next person please!

214
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:59,460
Please go inside.

215
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,180
Please go in the middle.

216
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,470
Go inside please.

217
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,560
Soichi?

218
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,770
Are you Soichi?

219
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,810
It's me! It's me!

220
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,780
Kaneda! From Iiyama!

221
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:36,590
Kaneda?

222
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,680
Kaneda Yoji?

223
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:42,170
Oh, Soichi! You are still here?

224
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,800
Still here?

225
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:45,930
I'll always been here!

226
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:49,130
It's okay. You won't catch anything by a handshake.

227
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,710
I'm 55!

228
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,860
If I get infected then I'm going to die.

229
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:57,070
But man...you've gotten so old.

230
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,970
You're too youthful for your age!

231
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:00,380
Who is that?

232
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:03,060
My daughter!

233
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,990
Nice to meet you. I'm Kaneda.

234
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,460
I'm your Dad's childhood friend.

235
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,740
How old are you right now?

236
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,100
19.

237
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,690
That means that you still haven't gotten the surgery.

238
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,640
Why did you come here?

239
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,290
I'm a doctor.

240
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,240
I thought about helping out my hometown.

241
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:23,310
More and more people are getting sick after all.

242
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,280
Take off your glasses.

243
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:29,150
Weren't you on our side before?

244
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,510
Why are you talking to me like this now?

245
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,520
Alright! Let's start!

246
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:05,120
Such stupid crap!

247
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,300
Are you okay with going back first?

248
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,270
Without Junko-san.

249
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:26,860
What's up with you?

250
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,660
When did you start talking like that?

251
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:53,690
I'm gonna take a bath first.

252
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,000
Do you need something?

253
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,520
Permits will be available next week.

254
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,330
Umm...

255
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:50,510
What are you doing?

256
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,230
Hold on! Don't move!

257
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:55,490
Ah, no...umm...it's nothing dangerous!

258
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,470
Put it on the ground!

259
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,390
It's okay! It's okay!

260
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,920
-Throw it out! -It's okay!

261
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,010
It's a mask.

262
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:14,660
I heard that NOX can't handle the sun....

263
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,970
It's iron so it's a little heavy...

264
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:23,320
If you put that on...

265
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,650
You can avoid the sun.

266
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,860
What am I going to do about my body?

267
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,260
The back of the head is also exposed!

268
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,860
It's too bad but...

269
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:39,030
Unauthorized transactions are strictly prohibited.

270
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,600
This is umm...

271
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,080
A greeting gift!

272
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,780
I will be a NOX member next year.

273
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,240
The lottery system was restored after all.

274
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,250
What are the chances of being selected?

275
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:05,140
Seven people under 20.

276
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:08,630
But no one else will sign up!

277
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,140
I'll probably be the only one...

278
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:11,310
Why don't they sign up?

279
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:15,820
Everyone hates NOX after all.

280
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,750
I want to study at a NOX school...

281
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,630
And learn some technical jobs!

282
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,810
Before I go there...

283
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,070
 I want to learn all kinds of things!

284
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,340
That's why...

285
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,180
Umm...

286
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,930
I want to become friends!

287
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,460
With me?

288
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:49,260
Yeah!

289
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:02,570
You can't.

290
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,810
I'm working.

291
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,510
You can become a NOX member now!

292
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,570
They have volunteer applications for one week.

293
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,260
So what?

294
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,920
You'll be twenty next year.

295
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,670
This is your last chance.

296
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,770
Didn't you hate them?

297
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:59,870
Old man Mitake is over 80 and probably infected.

298
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,790
You can't be afraid of the virus forever.

299
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,060
You can become a NOX..

300
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:07,190
That's why...

301
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,750
Mom left right?

302
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,200
I won't become a NOX member.

303
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,680
You've been there the whole time?

304
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:21,620
The people in Shikoku...

305
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:25,250
Can live without relying on NOX right?

306
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,990
I'm going to Shikoku!

307
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:32,750
What are you going to do in Shikoku?

308
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:37,660
I'll learn how to make everyone's lives better.

309
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:41,810
What are you going to do after that?

310
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,120
Come back home!

311
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,830
I'll show you!

312
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,330
That Mom was wrong.

313
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,980
I heard that you couldn't have children.

314
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,420
I heard that the child couldn't be saved.

315
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,850
I've gotten used to it.

316
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,390
This is the 10th miscarriage.

317
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:40,160
Science is advancing but birth rates aren't going up.

318
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:42,700
I'm sorry that I'm not capable enough...

319
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,970
Aren't you in the medicine field Kaneda-kun?

320
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,300
That's true....

321
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:56,740
I wonder if there's no love in my sex with Seiji-san?

322
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:57,800
If you're okay with me...

323
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,280
I can be your partner anytime.

324
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,890
Stop that.

325
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,140
Why?

326
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:05,480
You're having sex with other men besides Seiji-san right?

327
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:06,970
Yeah.

328
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,770
But former CURIO people are awkward.

329
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:15,000
You still have those kinds of feelings huh?

330
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:19,150
I became a NOX member later on.

331
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,590
You were 30 during that time huh?

332
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:25,380
20 is the upper limit now.

333
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,430
Be the way...

334
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,900
I saw your ex-husband in the CURIO area.

335
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,560
Soichi?

336
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:46,370
Your daughter too.

337
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,570
It was Yuu-chan right?

338
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,320
They're still there?

339
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,310
It's a pity.

340
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,230
They were basically deserted there.

341
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,030
Is he old now?

342
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,200
Yeah.

343
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,130
CURIO people age quickly.

344
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:03,300
That's right.

345
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:10,620
I heard that 72 people were born in Osaka.

346
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:11,760
You still have a chance.

347
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:17,960
Kaneda-kun said that adoption is an option as well.

348
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,350
I don't agree with him.

349
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,900
You're using avocado again?

350
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,540
I heard that it is good for conception.

351
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:26,820
That is superstition.

352
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:34,770
It seems like the Miura family next door are adopting.

353
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,040
They adopted a six year old boy.

354
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:39,170
The earlier the surgery, the better.

355
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,230
Seiji-san?

356
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,990
Before I became a NOX member...

357
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,510
Do you remember how I gave birth to a kid?

358
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,830
Yeah.

359
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,460
I heard that she is still in District 8.

360
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:01,090
She'll turn 20 next year.

361
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,280
What kind of child do you think she is now?

362
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:05,150
Who knows...

363
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,380
Maybe I should go and see her.

364
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,310
It would be better if you didn't.

365
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,420
They have their pride as well.

366
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:17,030
Besides, she was only three when you came here right?

367
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,760
She probably doesn't remember how you look.

368
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,030
You guys better not sign up!!

369
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,790
I'm 23 anyways.

370
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,630
Who will be the next village chief if I leave?

371
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:38,390
Why do you want to be a NOX member Mitsuhiko?

372
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,080
You'll never see the sun again!

373
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,230
Is that okay?

374
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,560
That's fine!

375
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,250
I'll be able to eat yummy food!

376
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,610
And I can go to a good school. It's the best!

377
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,750
You skip classes!

378
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,270
Shut up, you ugly hag!

379
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:53,110
It's because your Dad is so preachy!

380
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,550
You flat chest! Flat chest!

381
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,060
Stupid! Try and stop me!

382
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:58,050
Hey hold on!

383
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:58,870
Don't jump down damn it!

384
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,630
Come on! You ugly hag!

385
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,170
Hold on!

386
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,830
Why are you running away?

387
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:05,240
I'll tell your pops!

388
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:06,250
That his class is boring!

389
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,170
Hold on!

390
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,850
Hold on dummy!

391
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,440
Stop running!

392
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:17,150
Ugly!

393
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,490
Come on! Come on! You're too slow!

394
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,060
Do something about your pops!

395
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:27,360
Hold on Mitsuhiko!

396
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,640
You're too slow!

397
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,810
Come on!

398
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,710
Hold on!

399
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:41,600
Too slow!

400
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:45,520
Catch him!

401
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,450
You're weak! Too weak!

402
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:54,560
Where are you going?

403
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:56,320
Over here!

404
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:06,000
That hurt!

405
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:08,630
Only stupid people join NOX!

406
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,950
Shut up!

407
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,650
I'm stupid because I was born as a CURIO!

408
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,090
It's because I'm stuck here!

409
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,240
Do you know what CURIO is?

410
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,310
What?

411
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,860
It means antique.

412
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:22,090
It's a discriminating term.

413
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,170
For real?

414
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,330
That pisses me off.

415
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,860
You dummy! You don't know anything!

416
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,180
Shut up!

417
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:35,890
Don't sign up! Alright?

418
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,320
Don't sign up!

419
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,690
We won't!

420
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:41,870
Bye bye!

421
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,460
Shut up! Flat chest!

422
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:45,510
Shut up!

423
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,530
Shut up!

424
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:48,810
Geez...

425
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,290
He really is an idiot.

426
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,950
If he put up with it then he could make money selling meat and vegetables.

427
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,370
He can also watch TV.

428
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,110
He can drive a car too.

429
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,880
There will be all kinds of new things coming in.

430
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:03,170
Is that okay?

431
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,690
Of course!

432
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,640
We've been enduring this until now.

433
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,990
Everyone is going to have a nice life together.

434
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,130
We want that don't we?

435
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,090
I improved it!

436
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,380
This will protect the back of the head!

437
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,290
I'm sorry for calling you out here.

438
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,390
You are a person of interest.

439
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:19,330
This is my little sister and news reporter Sadako.

440
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,020
Nice to meet you. I'm Sadako.

441
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:25,930
I should have chosen a less flashy name...

442
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,020
Hey...

443
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:31,810
Can you talk to me for a little bit?

444
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,030
I'm curious about people of the sun.

445
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:35,850
How does that sound?

446
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,530
Communication is permitted again.

447
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,510
You can talk about anything.

448
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,510
That's fine...

449
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,950
Thanks!

450
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,830
This is a gift. Here you go.

451
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,690
Where is your thank you?

452
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:06,620
You say thank you when you get something from someone.

453
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:08,190
Words are also a gift.

454
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,110
Thank you.

455
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,140
Sadako!

456
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:18,870
We don't want to be seen by people, so please get in the car.

457
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:22,550
I'll talk to your father about old times.

458
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:30,880
Kaneda-kun! The key.

459
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:35,390
Call your big brother by his first name!

460
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,890
Wanna drive?

461
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,240
You haven't done it before right?

462
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,660
You can step on the gas a little harder.

463
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:03,540
It will automatically control the speed.

464
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:07,570
Umm...

465
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:11,080
Can you stop staring at me?

466
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,460
What is this?

467
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:24,960
My mother became a NOX member when I was three.

468
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,890
She abandoned my father and me.

469
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,600
She said she wanted to leave the village.

470
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:35,120
She didn't want to live a poor life.

471
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,240
It seems like she said that.

472
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,560
I was always crying, my friend's mother gave this to me.

473
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,460
When I get lonely, she told me to hold on to it.

474
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:50,490
What is her name?

475
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:52,910
Junko-san.

476
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,750
She's a good person huh?

477
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,630
It doesn't hurt at all does it?

478
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,960
I polished it a ton!

479
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:05,990
Also the back...

480
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:06,770
Here...

481
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,260
And here.

482
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:14,290
Light will come through the slits.

483
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:17,190
I know that!

484
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:24,660
Damn it!

485
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:26,340
If only I had a solder!

486
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,520
A solder? What is that?

487
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:32,760
It's used to join and mold metal.

488
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:34,490
You're from NOX and don't know what it is?

489
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,180
Unlike Curio, we have a better division of labor.

490
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,770
Don't say CURIO!

491
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,280
Don't say Curio!

492
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:49,850
Why not?

493
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:52,740
It's a discriminatory term!

494
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:55,150
We don't call ourselves Curio!

495
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:59,020
Then what do you call yourselves?

496
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:07,990
Humans.

497
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:14,670
Hey Sadoko-san...

498
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,390
You're my Mom aren't you?

499
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:23,790
How did you know?

500
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:27,530
I don't really get it but...

501
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:31,010
When you touched me, I got that feeling.

502
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:36,480
For you to find out when you don't really know is amazing.

503
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,570
You're a smart girl.

504
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:56,980
I thought about killing my Mom if I ever saw her!

505
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:00,790
I'd hit her a ton!

506
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:02,660
And kick her!

507
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:04,270
And say awful things to her!

508
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,060
I'd push her down from a high place!

509
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:15,330
I'm frustrated!

510
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:19,530
I was abandoned!

511
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:16,490
Thanks for today.

512
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:21,110
If you'd like...

513
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:24,560
Come to my house and have some fun next time.

514
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:34,460
Are you trying to take away my daughter too?

515
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,440
Soichi...

516
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,140
You've gotten so...

517
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:43,450
I've gotten old huh?

518
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,130
I'm old aren't I?

519
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,340
It's been 16 years since you've gone.

520
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,470
Yuu has...

521
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:50,550
Don't say her name!

522
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:54,510
You don't have that qualification!

523
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,060
Get in!

524
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:06,830
Ouch!

525
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:11,630
Do you want to join NOX?

526
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,830
After you met your Mom, you wanna be a NOX?

527
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:17,990
Stop it!

528
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,890
You can live a good life there can't you?

529
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,140
You can make friends and have a good job.

530
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:30,710
Get ready to leave and pack your bags!

531
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:31,790
Shut up!

532
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,560
I'm sorry about the other day!

533
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:35,910
Reiko was in the wrong.

534
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:38,010
I don't know if it's her motherly instinct or what.

535
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,810
Even if she abandoned her, it's still her daughter.

536
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,090
Kaneda-kun!

537
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,400
How old were you when you became a NOX member?

538
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:45,780
I was 17.

539
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:46,920
How did it feel?

540
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:51,010
Refreshed is the perfect word for it.

541
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:54,060
When I opened my eyes, the scenery and my vision changed...

542
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:57,060
And I felt like everything was under the control of logic.

543
00:46:57,210 --> 00:46:59,950
I was fully able to conquer myself.

544
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,790
I was born into it so I don't really understand.

545
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:03,920
Seiji-san...

546
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:05,660
What are you so anxious about?

547
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:33,210
Reiko says she wants to adopt a Curio child.

548
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:36,110
Nox's low birth rate is a fact.

549
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:37,640
That is true...

550
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:42,100
I can't get rid of the prejudice behind Curio.

551
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:44,460
I'm the same way.

552
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:49,740
They are too attached to their feelings and relationships.

553
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:52,980
That's why they can't escape the poverty and violence.

554
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:56,520
I'd take care of an adopted son.

555
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:48,420
What's wrong?

556
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:55,470
Murai is back!

557
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:57,240
Murai?

558
00:48:57,390 --> 00:48:58,990
Yes! Murai!

559
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:02,560
It's Murai?

560
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:02,930
Yeah!

561
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:03,640
Where?

562
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:06,920
They're in the foothills!

563
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:07,870
What are you doing?

564
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:09,950
Why is it always just the adults?

565
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:13,050
There's things that children shouldn't know!

566
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:13,960
Go home damn it!

567
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:15,190
Stop screwing with me!

568
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:16,720
Don't treat me like a child!

569
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:17,660
You're a child aren't you?

570
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:19,060
I'm not a kid!

571
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:23,860
In Shikoku... It's much worse than what we thought.

572
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:27,470
All of the rumors are false!

573
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:31,310
They're not living good lives in Shikoku?

574
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:37,820
We're lucky that we left so soon.

575
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:40,330
The rest of them are suffering...

576
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:44,310
War and plunder has caused many deaths.

577
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:49,670
Some eldery women have even starved to death.

578
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:56,390
Fortunately the children still have a chance to become NOX.

579
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:57,470
Become NOX?

580
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:03,170
They have a hard time giving birth.

581
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,800
They have no choice but to adopt.

582
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:09,620
Many children have been adopted in Shikoku legally.

583
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:13,150
Well but...

584
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:17,770
The children are guaranteed to live as NOX members.

585
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,060
They don't have to worry about it.

586
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:26,910
Is that what NOX gave you?

587
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:28,530
Isn't that Sake?

588
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:45,410
Katsuya...

589
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,390
Umm...

590
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:51,440
Where is Katsuya?

591
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,010
Where is Katsuya?

592
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,640
I don't know.

593
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:09,950
What are we going to do now?

594
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:12,780
We're not going to do anything.

595
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,810
The people who left have come back. That's all.

596
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:28,960
Go on without me.

597
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:30,720
I remembered something.

598
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,200
Hey! Soichi!

599
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:55,930
Come get a drink!

600
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:08,940
What is it?

601
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:16,340
This...

602
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:23,700
Does this mean what I think it does?

603
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:31,890
Wasn't she always reluctant?

604
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:35,290
She said that she was going to revitalize the village...

605
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:41,750
Everyone just came back...

606
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:42,670
Today is the last day right?

607
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:45,330
Please.

608
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:46,660
Soichi.

609
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:49,160
Soichi!

610
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:52,770
Hey...Pops!

611
00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:39,330
What happened with the application form?

612
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:47,100
Why are you doing this on your own?

613
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:48,670
Who asked you to do that?

614
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:49,960
It's a lottery.

615
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:51,640
You don't know if you'll get chosen or not.

616
00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:53,590
I told you that I don't want to be a NOX member!

617
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:55,600
Why did you do it on your own?

618
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:58,590
This village is done for.

619
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:01,780
If you have even the slightest bit of chance...

620
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,840
You don't know that!

621
00:54:08,770 --> 00:54:10,210
It's because of that, isn't it Dad?

622
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:11,940
You're trying to kick me out of the house right?

623
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:14,760
Then you can live together with Junko-san!

624
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:18,320
In that case, you should just get married to her!

625
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:20,890
Junko-san has always been waiting for it!

626
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,030
But like...

627
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:26,210
You don't have to care about what other people think of her! Just be with her!

628
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,350
That way I can leave the house peacefully!

629
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,150
Why did you do this on your own?

630
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,730
You know that I don't want to be a Nox member...

631
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:38,680
Why do things always turn out like this?

632
00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:41,940
That's why Mom left you!

633
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:35,920
Good evening.

634
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:37,010
What can I do for you?

635
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:41,750
Umm...

636
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:46,690
I would like to go here.

637
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:50,370
In order to go into NOX territory, you need to schedule it one week in advance.

638
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:51,900
Not just anyone can go in.

639
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:54,980
They said if I showed you this I could get in.

640
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:00,910
Hold on a second please.

641
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,390
Souga Reiko-san.

642
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:20,680
They are spouses that serve in the district government.

643
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:24,260
You should get in with this.

644
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:25,350
I'll confirm it.

645
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:34,770
Yeah.

646
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,980
It will be fine if she comes.

647
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:38,720
I'll come and pick her up right away.

648
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:49,130
This is a three hour visa.

649
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,090
The consequences will be severe if it times out so please be cautious.

650
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:56,160
Go one Kilometer ahead and there's an old bus stop.

651
00:56:56,770 --> 00:56:58,470
It seems like she's going to pick you up there.

652
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,640
I'll hold on to this for you.

653
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:31,430
Thanks.

654
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:36,060
Be safe.

655
00:58:17,210 --> 00:58:18,280
It's time!

656
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:30,310
Is there any way you can secretly invalidate it?

657
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:32,750
I can't.

658
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:34,530
They're watching us.

659
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:45,050
The 8th district!

660
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:49,580
This year's minors...

661
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:52,720
Will get the NOX conversion surgery.

662
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:59,770
The applicants for residency are two people.

663
00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:02,680
I'm sending the application now.

664
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:18,810
Yes? Hello?

665
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:22,620
Did you get it?

666
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:25,870
It's done?

667
01:00:28,510 --> 01:00:29,440
It's done already?

668
01:00:31,430 --> 01:00:32,080
Yeah.

669
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:43,910
The results came right away.

670
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:25,360
If you told me about this sooner, I could have arranged for you to stay over.

671
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,060
Why did you do this all of the sudden?

672
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,270
I want to ask you something.

673
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:46,090
If that's what you are talking about then it's true.

674
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:49,580
The Shikoku region was a total failure.

675
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,570
It's a pity that companies were investing heavily into them with high expectations.

676
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:56,590
The ending result was faction struggles and chaos among the Curio.

677
01:01:59,190 --> 01:02:01,580
I want to confirm it with my own eyes.

678
01:02:02,430 --> 01:02:05,600
If you want to go no matter what, then I don't mind granting that request.

679
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:07,180
It's just...

680
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:15,900
After you arrive in Shikoku the only thing you will see is despair and violence.

681
01:02:35,330 --> 01:02:36,250
Yuu...

682
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:41,510
I have a plan.

683
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:49,600
Shit...

684
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:54,320
You could separate the pieces.

685
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:56,730
But light will get in right?

686
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:57,920
Attach the adapter.

687
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:01,670
I know that!

688
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:03,810
You're so annoying with all your blabbering.

689
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:09,260
You seem a little impatient today Tetsuhiko.

690
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:13,140
The results for the lottery are coming out.

691
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,350
Shit!

692
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:21,210
What a mess!

693
01:03:42,450 --> 01:03:43,310
I'm sorry Tetsuhiko.

694
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:44,860
It was no good.

695
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,390
You can try again next year, okay?

696
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:10,000
How did I fail?

697
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:13,570
Let's go home for today okay?

698
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,360
Tetsuhiko.

699
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:19,120
You can do it again next year.

700
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:22,500
You can enjoy the sun this year...

701
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:24,800
I don't need the sun!

702
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:26,170
Let's go home Tetsuhiko.

703
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,930
I'll go home on my own! You old hag!

704
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:30,090
Tetsuhiko!

705
01:04:58,170 --> 01:05:00,080
My uncle killed a NOX member right?

706
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:03,870
I lost because there's criminals in my family right?

707
01:05:04,310 --> 01:05:06,420
Why was I born in this household!?

708
01:05:06,450 --> 01:05:07,290
You shitty old hag!

709
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:08,490
Hey Tetsuhiko!

710
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,540
You...You...

711
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,880
You look down on me don't you?

712
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:16,770
You discriminate us!

713
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:18,190
I don't need your pity!

714
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:32,440
Why?

715
01:05:35,370 --> 01:05:37,940
Why wasn't I born as a NOX?

716
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:43,120
I..I...

717
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:47,390
I wanted to live a good life and eat yummy food!

718
01:05:48,230 --> 01:05:50,610
I can't stand this place anymore!

719
01:05:51,620 --> 01:05:52,800
I've had enough!

720
01:05:54,030 --> 01:05:55,730
I've had enough!

721
01:05:56,970 --> 01:06:02,290
Your uncle said the same thing 10 years ago.

722
01:06:16,490 --> 01:06:18,200
Damn it!!!

723
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:33,550
Yuu! Where did Yuu go?

724
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:34,940
Are you looking for Ikuta Yuu-san?

725
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:35,550
That's right!

726
01:06:35,570 --> 01:06:37,140
Hey! Where did she go?

727
01:06:37,290 --> 01:06:38,780
She went to the other side at around 8pm.

728
01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:41,710
-Yuu... -Hey!

729
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:42,370
Yuu!

730
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:44,140
-You can't! -Yuu!

731
01:06:44,290 --> 01:06:45,590
You can't do that!

732
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:47,780
-You can't go without permission! -Let go!

733
01:06:47,930 --> 01:06:48,690
Stop!

734
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:50,090
I said let go!

735
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:50,980
Stop!

736
01:07:58,800 --> 01:07:59,620
Morning!

737
01:07:59,770 --> 01:08:00,900
Good morning.

738
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:02,620
Where's everyone else?

739
01:08:02,770 --> 01:08:05,460
Dad wouldn't let them come here.

740
01:08:05,610 --> 01:08:08,510
Yuu-chan is going to become a NOX right?

741
01:08:32,910 --> 01:08:33,830
Where is Tetsuhiko?

742
01:08:34,450 --> 01:08:35,550
He's depressed.

743
01:08:36,690 --> 01:08:38,160
He'll come back to work in a few days.

744
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:37,820
Are you okay?

745
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:48,760
Yuu-chan...

746
01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:53,380
Go home for today.

747
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:55,690
But...

748
01:09:57,170 --> 01:09:59,250
Go and prepare lunch with your Dad.

749
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:00,760
Okay?

750
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:04,940
Yeah...

751
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,890
You said that you would live together with us right?

752
01:11:58,400 --> 01:11:59,450
Your shoes!

753
01:12:00,580 --> 01:12:01,380
Why?

754
01:12:02,070 --> 01:12:03,250
Why are you running away?

755
01:12:05,810 --> 01:12:07,110
I wasn't the one who did it.

756
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:09,170
But you were chosen!

757
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:10,700
I haven't decided to become NOX yet.

758
01:12:10,850 --> 01:12:12,840
Then why were you in that NOX place!?

759
01:12:12,850 --> 01:12:14,180
Shut up!

760
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:16,060
Don't yell at me!

761
01:12:16,210 --> 01:12:16,810
You...

762
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:19,110
You're going to become NOX right?

763
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:21,250
My Dad decided that!

764
01:12:22,690 --> 01:12:26,280
Are you going to leave me? Hey!

765
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:28,460
I won't forgive you!

766
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:31,730
You don't have to forgive me!

767
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:33,970
Don't screw with me!

768
01:12:35,540 --> 01:12:37,280
Don't screw with me!

769
01:12:37,430 --> 01:12:40,580
Stop it! Stop it!

770
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:44,060
No!!

771
01:12:47,670 --> 01:12:48,470
Let go!

772
01:12:50,210 --> 01:12:50,950
Yuu!

773
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:52,500
-No! -Get back here!

774
01:12:52,650 --> 01:12:55,510
-I like you! -Stop!

775
01:12:55,660 --> 01:12:57,220
-I always have... -Stop!

776
01:12:57,370 --> 01:13:00,440
You said that you would be together with us!

777
01:13:00,590 --> 01:13:02,730
-Stop it Takumi! -Yuu!

778
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,900
-Takumi! -You said we've be together right?

779
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:08,450
No!

780
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:11,340
No!

781
01:13:12,030 --> 01:13:13,280
Stop it!

782
01:13:17,370 --> 01:13:18,670
Stop!

783
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:21,920
Stop!

784
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:34,130
Please let me go!

785
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:36,060
Takumi!

786
01:13:39,430 --> 01:13:40,510
Stop it!

787
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,650
Stop it!

788
01:13:45,730 --> 01:13:46,240
Yuu!

789
01:13:47,030 --> 01:13:48,720
Stop it!

790
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:55,020
You little shit!

791
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:58,780
Hold on damn it!

792
01:16:04,630 --> 01:16:05,490
You little shit!

793
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:10,890
Hey!

794
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:12,570
Damn you!

795
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:18,390
Damn you!

796
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:21,520
Damn you!

797
01:16:21,670 --> 01:16:22,890
Soichi!!

798
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:24,170
Hey! Soichi!

799
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:25,050
What have you done?

800
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:27,620
-Damn you! -Stop it!

801
01:16:27,770 --> 01:16:29,230
Soichi!

802
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:30,360
Let me go damn it!

803
01:16:34,050 --> 01:16:34,780
Stop it!

804
01:16:35,970 --> 01:16:37,100
Let me go damn it!

805
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:09,750
Get over here! Explain this to everyone!

806
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:11,580
Hey! Sit down!

807
01:17:36,580 --> 01:17:38,870
Why did you do something like this?

808
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:42,780
Huh?

809
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:04,190
Say something!

810
01:18:08,210 --> 01:18:09,450
Hey!!

811
01:18:54,210 --> 01:19:00,950
I don't blame you for losing the lottery.

812
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:23,910
I'm going to go running.

813
01:20:15,050 --> 01:20:16,860
I'm sorry about saying those awful things the other day.

814
01:20:20,770 --> 01:20:22,910
It's rare for someone to become my friend.

815
01:20:32,630 --> 01:20:36,000
If you'd like...you can hold on to this for me.

816
01:20:45,130 --> 01:20:46,930
There's no point in me having it.

817
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:53,440
Tetsuhiko...

818
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:57,190
Do you want to go on a trip with me?

819
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:01,840
A trip? Where to?

820
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:04,140
Anywhere is fine!

821
01:21:07,050 --> 01:21:09,020
Japan is very vast!

822
01:21:12,310 --> 01:21:13,120
Look!

823
01:21:17,980 --> 01:21:20,370
It's different than the one I see at school...

824
01:21:20,860 --> 01:21:22,230
This is NOX's map.

825
01:21:23,260 --> 01:21:25,000
Is there anywhere you'd like to go?

826
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:30,340
I want to see the ocean.

827
01:21:35,110 --> 01:21:36,000
We can go.

828
01:21:36,030 --> 01:21:37,330
We can go by car.

829
01:21:37,390 --> 01:21:38,650
But you can't in the afternoon....

830
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:42,380
That's why you can drive in the afternoon and I can drive in the night.

831
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:44,060
I work all the time.

832
01:21:44,670 --> 01:21:46,190
This is unprecedented.

833
01:21:46,210 --> 01:21:48,200
A NOX and Curio trip.

834
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:08,330
You don't have to say CURIO.

835
01:22:13,150 --> 01:22:14,030
Alright!

836
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:15,950
Alright!

837
01:22:16,580 --> 01:22:18,560
Let's plan this out!

838
01:22:18,580 --> 01:22:20,590
Maybe someone can sponsor us!

839
01:22:20,610 --> 01:22:21,920
That why we'll get money for it!

840
01:22:21,940 --> 01:22:23,080
That's a joke right?

841
01:22:27,870 --> 01:22:29,380
They can't do something like that.

842
01:22:32,790 --> 01:22:33,890
I'm a CURIO.

843
01:22:49,610 --> 01:22:50,770
I need to apologize...

844
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:56,500
I need to apologize to Tetsuhiko...

845
01:22:58,020 --> 01:22:59,830
It's fine...

846
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:01,820
-I need to apologize! -Yuu-chan!

847
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:02,740
Yuu-chan!

848
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:03,760
Stay back!

849
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,310
This is my problem.

850
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:19,210
That's not true!

851
01:23:19,210 --> 01:23:21,160
NOX isn't perfect!

852
01:23:21,210 --> 01:23:23,360
But everyone goes to a proper school right?

853
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:25,680
I'm different than you.

854
01:23:28,290 --> 01:23:30,750
I can't make something like this.

855
01:23:31,730 --> 01:23:34,780
The schools that you can get into are based on your IQ that you are born with.

856
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,580
The assigned work is also determined by a fitness test you take as a child.

857
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:41,800
You say it's alright but in the end it's just separation by class.

858
01:23:42,980 --> 01:23:46,330
In order to increase the birth rate...

859
01:23:46,340 --> 01:23:49,370
Personal freedom is useless compared to economic rationalization.

860
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:54,340
What are you talking about?

861
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:56,160
I'm talking about me.

862
01:23:57,430 --> 01:23:59,470
I want to see a world I've never seen before.

863
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:02,620
That's why I want to go on a trip.

864
01:24:30,510 --> 01:24:31,560
Shit!

865
01:24:40,420 --> 01:24:41,270
You!

866
01:24:42,220 --> 01:24:43,630
Are you Tetsuhiko?

867
01:24:43,690 --> 01:24:44,420
Who are you?

868
01:24:44,770 --> 01:24:45,930
It's me! It's me!

869
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:48,080
Have you forgotten your uncle's face?

870
01:24:49,180 --> 01:24:52,080
You've gotten so big!

871
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:54,220
You haven't been eating good food but have gotten so big!

872
01:24:54,230 --> 01:24:56,410
You must be a fool!

873
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:03,080
What?

874
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:06,050
Did my nephew do something?

875
01:25:06,860 --> 01:25:08,830
Isn't the sanction over?

876
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:13,350
What the hell is this?

877
01:25:13,570 --> 01:25:14,460
Surveillance?

878
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:16,330
No...

879
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:18,930
For crying out loud!

880
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:22,280
This village hasn't changed at all!

881
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:24,730
What have they been doing for 10 years?

882
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:26,250
Umm...

883
01:25:26,450 --> 01:25:29,290
Drinking while driving a motorcycle is illegal.

884
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:30,580
Look at the full moon!

885
01:25:30,590 --> 01:25:31,570
Just kidding!

886
01:25:46,450 --> 01:25:47,390
Oh, this?

887
01:25:47,690 --> 01:25:49,620
Umm...can you let me go?

888
01:25:49,790 --> 01:25:52,680
That's impossible...

889
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:53,790
Let him go!

890
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:55,340
He's my friend!

891
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:56,660
Friend?

892
01:25:56,940 --> 01:25:57,870
With this guy?

893
01:25:58,140 --> 01:26:00,080
You're being deceived.

894
01:26:00,140 --> 01:26:02,150
You're stupid so you've been brainwashed.

895
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:03,870
Right?

896
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:05,120
That's not true!

897
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:11,690
Your friend here is trying to act cool with a Curio friend...this bastard!

898
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:15,760
We aren't pets...

899
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:20,020
Everyone one of them are the same!

900
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:24,140
Their hearts are stones!

901
01:26:25,330 --> 01:26:27,040
You messed up the village didn't you?

902
01:26:27,510 --> 01:26:29,120
He's the same as them!

903
01:26:31,290 --> 01:26:32,160
You are...

904
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:33,290
Okudera!

905
01:26:33,310 --> 01:26:34,620
Shut up!

906
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:38,060
Get back! It's dangerous!

907
01:26:38,070 --> 01:26:39,690
Your wounds will get infected if they touch his blood!

908
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:43,440
Umm...I think you're getting the wrong idea...

909
01:26:43,530 --> 01:26:45,270
-We... -Enough!!

910
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:48,640
You lie to us with your rhetoric!

911
01:26:48,670 --> 01:26:49,900
Your specialty is speaking.

912
01:26:49,930 --> 01:26:51,490
That's your ace!

913
01:26:51,510 --> 01:26:52,460
For now..

914
01:26:52,490 --> 01:26:54,200
Can you let me out of this?

915
01:26:54,230 --> 01:26:56,120
I won't file an assault incident.

916
01:26:56,130 --> 01:26:57,360
You bastard...

917
01:26:57,640 --> 01:27:00,130
Don't you dare look down on me!

918
01:27:00,150 --> 01:27:01,420
Stop it! Stop it!

919
01:27:19,590 --> 01:27:21,830
What are you doing? What are you doing?

920
01:27:25,260 --> 01:27:27,900
Well...hang in there.

921
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:29,020
Shit!

922
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:40,270
Hey! What are you doing!?

923
01:27:48,220 --> 01:27:50,580
What the hell? What the hell?

924
01:27:51,430 --> 01:27:52,800
What the hell is up with him?

925
01:27:52,950 --> 01:27:53,960
Shit!

926
01:27:58,280 --> 01:27:59,530
How do I get this off?

927
01:28:00,250 --> 01:28:01,190
I'll get some help!

928
01:28:01,350 --> 01:28:03,070
I'll open it! I'll open it!

929
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:04,670
It won't open without my certification!

930
01:28:05,430 --> 01:28:08,390
You can call someone to come from the other side!

931
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:10,670
It would be bad if someone saw us!

932
01:28:10,690 --> 01:28:11,700
Someone is going to see us!

933
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:14,430
It's not as simple as economic situations!

934
01:28:15,220 --> 01:28:16,080
Shit!

935
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:18,580
What are we going to do? If the sun comes out...

936
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:20,460
Do you have any wire cutters?

937
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:21,430
Wire cutters?

938
01:28:21,490 --> 01:28:22,960
It can be anything that can cut!

939
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:25,470
Something that can cut! Something that can cut!

940
01:28:26,170 --> 01:28:31,080
Wire cutters! Wire cutters! Wire cutters!

941
01:28:54,380 --> 01:28:58,700
Wire cutters...wire cutters....wire cutters!

942
01:28:58,710 --> 01:29:00,700
-Tetsuhiko!-Wire cutters!

943
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:02,860
Tetsuhiko!

944
01:29:17,850 --> 01:29:19,380
What happened Tetsuhiko?

945
01:29:20,260 --> 01:29:23,700
I-I need something that cuts!

946
01:29:23,710 --> 01:29:25,240
-Something that cuts! -Something that cuts?

947
01:29:25,270 --> 01:29:26,090
Why?

948
01:29:36,020 --> 01:29:36,920
Hey!

949
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:39,950
Tetsuhiko!

950
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:20,640
Are you okay?

951
01:30:30,710 --> 01:30:31,740
I'm fine!

952
01:30:58,360 --> 01:30:59,340
Are you okay?

953
01:31:22,290 --> 01:31:23,430
Katsuya...

954
01:31:54,150 --> 01:31:56,340
Hey, that's scary....what is that?

955
01:31:57,660 --> 01:31:59,710
I was looking a lot for something!

956
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:01,770
-What's going on? -Please don't touch me!

957
01:32:01,790 --> 01:32:02,610
I'm bleeding!

958
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:07,150
That was dangerous! Listen to me!

959
01:32:07,150 --> 01:32:07,880
Sorry!

960
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:09,990
Hold on! Hold on!

961
01:32:11,050 --> 01:32:12,360
You need to be more careful!

962
01:32:12,380 --> 01:32:13,420
Careful? Got it!

963
01:32:13,430 --> 01:32:15,050
Be careful Tetsuhiko!

964
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:22,880
Ouch!

965
01:32:22,890 --> 01:32:23,770
Shit!

966
01:32:28,130 --> 01:32:29,050
Shit!

967
01:32:32,700 --> 01:32:34,670
Damn it!

968
01:32:42,350 --> 01:32:45,060
Very shortly...

969
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:46,070
Shit!

970
01:32:46,220 --> 01:32:48,850
Everyone in the CURIO area...

971
01:32:46,390 --> 01:32:48,620
Hey Tetsuhiko! Let me see it!

972
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,990
Please return immediately.

973
01:32:49,930 --> 01:32:51,010
Geez!

974
01:32:53,330 --> 01:32:54,190
Hurry up!

975
01:32:54,260 --> 01:32:56,250
Very shortly...

976
01:32:57,990 --> 01:33:00,730
Everyone in the CURIO area....

977
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:02,600
Please return immediately.

978
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:07,720
Very shortly..

979
01:33:09,060 --> 01:33:12,040
Everyone in the CURIO area...

980
01:33:11,570 --> 01:33:13,530
Hey! It's starting to get brighter!

981
01:33:12,190 --> 01:33:13,380
Please return immediately!

982
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:14,730
Shut up! I know!

983
01:33:17,330 --> 01:33:18,110
The Mori Mask!

984
01:33:18,150 --> 01:33:20,640
The sun is about to rise.

985
01:33:21,940 --> 01:33:24,240
The sun is about to rise.

986
01:33:25,910 --> 01:33:27,560
It's no good! Damn it!

987
01:33:28,270 --> 01:33:30,800
The sun is about to rise.

988
01:33:28,650 --> 01:33:29,890
Tetsuhiko!

989
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:31,240
The Schlalf is in the back!

990
01:33:31,270 --> 01:33:31,970
The Schlaf?

991
01:33:31,540 --> 01:33:32,170
Bring it!

992
01:33:31,910 --> 01:33:34,100
The sun is about to rise.

993
01:33:32,060 --> 01:33:33,340
Schlaf?

994
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:34,100
The sleeping bag!

995
01:33:34,110 --> 01:33:35,640
Say that sooner!

996
01:33:36,830 --> 01:33:38,150
Sorry...

997
01:33:38,580 --> 01:33:41,080
The Sun is about to rise.

998
01:33:39,330 --> 01:33:39,940
It's okay!

999
01:33:39,860 --> 01:33:41,440
I'll do something about it!

1000
01:33:42,170 --> 01:33:44,960
The Sun is about to rise.

1001
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:45,920
Yuu! Yuu!

1002
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:51,560
The Sun is about to rise.

1003
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:55,580
The Sun is about to rise.

1004
01:33:53,900 --> 01:33:55,500
Hurry up Yuu!

1005
01:33:55,510 --> 01:33:56,730
I know that!

1006
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:02,320
That's hot!

1007
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:06,270
The sun is impossible....

1008
01:34:07,130 --> 01:34:09,010
What happens if the Sun hits you?

1009
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:13,490
It will probally be the same as the person who died 10 years ago.

1010
01:34:18,610 --> 01:34:19,530
The sun is about to rise.

1011
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:22,700
Damn it!

1012
01:34:21,850 --> 01:34:22,690
The sun is about to rise.

1013
01:34:28,310 --> 01:34:29,130
Damn it!

1014
01:34:28,550 --> 01:34:29,900
The Sun is about to rise.

1015
01:34:31,970 --> 01:34:32,760
The Sun is about to rise.

1016
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:53,670
Tetsuhiko!

1017
01:34:53,820 --> 01:34:54,600
A rope!

1018
01:34:54,750 --> 01:34:57,380
Tie my arm with a rope!

1019
01:34:57,530 --> 01:34:58,870
Tie it!

1020
01:34:58,900 --> 01:35:00,590
Tie it!

1021
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:01,840
Tie it!

1022
01:35:02,430 --> 01:35:03,750
Hurry up!

1023
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:07,440
Alright...

1024
01:35:08,270 --> 01:35:10,170
Cut off my hand with your axe!

1025
01:35:14,140 --> 01:35:16,100
Cut off my hand!

1026
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:20,780
I can't! I can't! I can't!

1027
01:35:20,790 --> 01:35:22,230
I'm strong.

1028
01:35:23,210 --> 01:35:24,380
Rather than being burned alive...

1029
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:27,010
I will be able to take less damage!

1030
01:35:29,030 --> 01:35:29,890
Hurry up.

1031
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:32,750
Hurry up Tetsuhiko!

1032
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:38,000
Tetsuhiko! Tetsuhiko!

1033
01:35:41,420 --> 01:35:42,300
Tetsuhiko...

1034
01:35:43,690 --> 01:35:45,690
We're going on a trip right?

1035
01:35:49,350 --> 01:35:51,440
You're the only one who can do this.

1036
01:35:55,310 --> 01:35:58,690
Be careful not to get my blood on you...

1037
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:05,440
Please...

1038
01:36:42,130 --> 01:36:43,010
The Mori mask...

1039
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:49,740
I'll definitely save you!

1040
01:37:01,960 --> 01:37:03,660
-Stabilize it! -I know that!

1041
01:37:36,550 --> 01:37:37,380
That's dangerous!

1042
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:39,500
What are you doing?

1043
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:40,910
Stay back Dad!

1044
01:37:42,710 --> 01:37:45,440
He has the Mori mask on!

1045
01:37:45,450 --> 01:37:46,940
-My uncle... -We need to hurry!

1046
01:37:46,950 --> 01:37:48,740
-Your uncle? -My uncle...

1047
01:37:48,770 --> 01:37:49,520
You can't!

1048
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:51,690
You can't open it Dad! Don't open it!

1049
01:37:52,470 --> 01:37:53,800
-Hurry up! -You guys...

1050
01:37:54,770 --> 01:37:56,820
What have you done!?

1051
01:37:56,970 --> 01:37:58,560
Hold on! Hold on!

1052
01:37:58,570 --> 01:38:00,990
-Cover him with this! -What have you done!?

1053
01:38:01,990 --> 01:38:03,480
Don't stop us Dad!

1054
01:38:19,810 --> 01:38:21,970
Soichi-san?

1055
01:38:21,980 --> 01:38:24,260
Long time no see!

1056
01:38:31,710 --> 01:38:32,370
You...

1057
01:38:33,270 --> 01:38:34,000
Yuu!

1058
01:38:34,970 --> 01:38:36,050
Is that Yuu?

1059
01:38:36,650 --> 01:38:38,160
You've gotten so big!

1060
01:38:38,170 --> 01:38:40,110
You're a woman now!

1061
01:38:43,190 --> 01:38:44,510
Okudera Katsuya!

1062
01:38:44,550 --> 01:38:46,300
I've come back from Shikoku!

1063
01:38:47,510 --> 01:38:48,820
What's up with you?

1064
01:38:48,820 --> 01:38:49,690
It's me!

1065
01:38:49,710 --> 01:38:53,300
The picture of my sister shaking hands was published!

1066
01:38:53,310 --> 01:38:55,600
She's still alive huh?

1067
01:38:58,870 --> 01:38:59,690
Huh?

1068
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:01,610
Is it that guy?

1069
01:39:03,350 --> 01:39:04,840
He's still alive huh?

1070
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:06,550
Katsuya!

1071
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:08,130
Why did you come back?

1072
01:39:08,140 --> 01:39:11,470
I thought about doing something for this village.

1073
01:39:12,460 --> 01:39:16,420
But every one of you haven't changed at all!

1074
01:39:16,420 --> 01:39:20,550
You've always been confined in the forest so that's why you're so old school!

1075
01:39:20,580 --> 01:39:23,260
I finally gave you guys an opportunity.

1076
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:25,280
Why won't you fight?

1077
01:39:25,290 --> 01:39:27,550
I've been reflecting like an idiot for 10 years.

1078
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:31,090
How long are we going to be these people's slaves?

1079
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:32,440
That's dangerous Tetsuhiko!

1080
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:36,640
Stop it Tetsuhiko!

1081
01:39:37,830 --> 01:39:40,950
You can't do that Tetsuhiko! Violence is no good!

1082
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:43,080
Don't be fooled by NOX!

1083
01:39:43,100 --> 01:39:44,210
Don't screw with me!

1084
01:39:45,470 --> 01:39:48,060
This is common in Shikoku!

1085
01:39:48,090 --> 01:39:49,120
Stop it!

1086
01:39:51,650 --> 01:39:53,010
-Hey Katsuya! -Yes?

1087
01:39:54,100 --> 01:39:56,900
Since you came back, why don't you go over to Junko-san's place right away?

1088
01:39:57,670 --> 01:39:58,560
Oneechan?

1089
01:39:59,540 --> 01:40:03,490
Do you know how she felt for these past 10 years?

1090
01:40:03,490 --> 01:40:04,880
Stop it Tetsuhiko...

1091
01:40:04,900 --> 01:40:05,850
I know!

1092
01:40:13,580 --> 01:40:14,870
You don't know!

1093
01:40:15,780 --> 01:40:16,860
You...

1094
01:40:17,750 --> 01:40:20,790
You ruined her and this village for 10 years!

1095
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:22,680
You have been brainwshed Soichi-san!

1096
01:40:22,690 --> 01:40:24,360
This is NOX's fault!

1097
01:40:24,410 --> 01:40:26,480
It's not NOX that ruined this village....

1098
01:40:27,050 --> 01:40:28,350
It's you!

1099
01:40:28,370 --> 01:40:29,260
And us!

1100
01:40:30,140 --> 01:40:32,810
We destroyed it ourselves!

1101
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:34,480
Soichi-san!

1102
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:36,800
You bastard!!

1103
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:40,730
Stop it! Stop it!

1104
01:40:46,680 --> 01:40:47,950
Don't touch her Yuu!

1105
01:40:48,550 --> 01:40:49,710
Neechan?

1106
01:40:51,310 --> 01:40:52,130
Neechan?

1107
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:54,320
Oneechan!

1108
01:40:56,690 --> 01:40:57,540
Neechan!

1109
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:01,080
Neechan...

1110
01:41:02,470 --> 01:41:03,310
Neechan?

1111
01:41:04,220 --> 01:41:08,970
Why didn't you get back here immediately? You shouldn't have come back!

1112
01:41:08,950 --> 01:41:09,900
Neechan!

1113
01:41:13,090 --> 01:41:17,720
She was worried about you and the village until the very end!

1114
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:22,760
Katsuya!!

1115
01:41:31,220 --> 01:41:32,530
Junko-san...

1116
01:41:33,620 --> 01:41:34,800
Junko-san!

1117
01:41:39,060 --> 01:41:40,130
Mom?

1118
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:41,860
Mom?

1119
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:46,970
Mom?

1120
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:51,090
I'll never forgive you...

1121
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:55,230
Mom?

1122
01:41:56,310 --> 01:41:57,440
Mom?

1123
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:07,920
Katsuya!

1124
01:42:07,940 --> 01:42:08,830
Katsuya!

1125
01:42:09,580 --> 01:42:11,050
You bastard!

1126
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:15,970
Katsuya you bastard!

1127
01:42:18,270 --> 01:42:19,550
You bastard!

1128
01:42:19,700 --> 01:42:22,700
It's because of you the village got ruined!

1129
01:42:25,660 --> 01:42:27,710
Don't come over here Soichi!

1130
01:42:29,060 --> 01:42:30,840
Don't come here.

1131
01:42:30,860 --> 01:42:32,160
Stay back!

1132
01:42:32,180 --> 01:42:33,030
Don't come here!

1133
01:42:33,270 --> 01:42:34,510
Don't interfere!

1134
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:37,630
We've made our decision!

1135
01:42:52,090 --> 01:42:53,250
Dad...

1136
01:42:54,740 --> 01:42:56,330
Dad!

1137
01:42:56,350 --> 01:42:57,820
Dad!

1138
01:42:57,850 --> 01:42:58,990
Dad!

1139
01:43:00,030 --> 01:43:02,670
Dad! Dad! Dad!

1140
01:43:44,620 --> 01:43:45,750
Shit!

1141
01:43:47,430 --> 01:43:48,460
Shit!

1142
01:43:49,050 --> 01:43:50,900
I'm going to die in a place like this?

1143
01:43:50,990 --> 01:43:53,010
In a place like this?

1144
01:43:53,030 --> 01:43:53,980
Shit!

1145
01:43:56,560 --> 01:43:57,610
Shit!

1146
01:43:57,640 --> 01:43:59,750
In a place like this?

1147
01:43:59,780 --> 01:44:00,780
Shit!

1148
01:44:04,910 --> 01:44:06,240
NOX's blood!

1149
01:44:07,510 --> 01:44:08,880
No! No!

1150
01:44:08,900 --> 01:44:09,850
I'm going to get infected!

1151
01:44:09,860 --> 01:44:10,530
No!

1152
01:44:12,630 --> 01:44:15,930
You bastard!

1153
01:44:16,460 --> 01:44:17,970
I'll never forgive you!

1154
01:44:18,900 --> 01:44:21,790
You ruined this village!

1155
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:24,620
Dad!

1156
01:44:24,990 --> 01:44:28,950
Hey Dad!

1157
01:44:29,710 --> 01:44:31,240
Dad!

1158
01:44:31,830 --> 01:44:33,280
You can't go!

1159
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:10,970
You can't!

1160
01:45:12,580 --> 01:45:13,470
You can't!

1161
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:14,770
Tetsuhiko!

1162
01:45:16,730 --> 01:45:18,040
Tetsuhiko!

1163
01:45:21,540 --> 01:45:23,470
You can't go!

1164
01:45:24,500 --> 01:45:25,570
Tetsuhiko!

1165
01:45:27,300 --> 01:45:28,610
Tetsuhiko!

1166
01:45:30,090 --> 01:45:31,080
Tetsuhiko!

1167
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:36,050
Tetsuhiko!

1168
01:45:36,850 --> 01:45:37,880
Tetsuhiko!

1169
01:45:40,720 --> 01:45:41,850
Tetsuhiko...

1170
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:44,610
Tetsuhiko...

1171
01:45:44,030 --> 01:45:45,340
Don't let him go!

1172
01:45:45,820 --> 01:45:47,290
You bastard!

1173
01:45:47,220 --> 01:45:49,390
-I'll kill you! -Tetsuhiko...

1174
01:45:51,350 --> 01:45:52,760
Tetsuhiko....

1175
01:45:57,950 --> 01:46:00,330
Katsuya!

1176
01:46:07,120 --> 01:46:08,510
Is he dead?

1177
01:46:12,750 --> 01:46:13,680
Is he dead?

1178
01:50:17,090 --> 01:50:18,420
Don't worry.

1179
01:50:26,860 --> 01:50:28,590
We'll give you an injection first.

1180
01:50:29,140 --> 01:50:32,330
Then after that, Reiko's blood will be pumped into you.

1181
01:50:33,260 --> 01:50:34,350
Then it will be over.

1182
01:50:34,760 --> 01:50:35,810
It's not scary.

1183
01:50:49,330 --> 01:50:49,980
Alright...

1184
01:50:49,990 --> 01:50:53,690
Inhale it slowly please...

1185
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:46,110
We're starting...

1186
01:54:57,540 --> 01:54:58,880
Are you okay now?

1187
01:54:59,820 --> 01:55:01,720
They helped me deal with it as an accident.

1188
01:55:02,860 --> 01:55:03,600
Is that right?

1189
01:56:33,220 --> 01:56:34,240
Are you okay?

1190
01:56:36,370 --> 01:56:37,110
Yeah!

1191
01:56:44,020 --> 01:56:46,330
How does it feel to be changed?

1192
01:56:48,130 --> 01:56:51,650
It feels kinda refreshing.

1193
01:56:52,460 --> 01:56:54,860
I feel like I was a fool for worrying about it.

1194
01:56:57,750 --> 01:57:00,190
There is a constant feeling of power flowing in my body...

1195
01:57:00,210 --> 01:57:02,650
I feel very free!

1196
01:57:04,690 --> 01:57:08,270
It makes me feel courageous.

1197
01:57:09,690 --> 01:57:12,230
If I would have converted earlier, I could have done a lot of stuff.

1198
01:57:13,250 --> 01:57:16,880
I was always thinking about what I can change....

1199
01:57:16,890 --> 01:57:19,010
Why haven't I done anything?

1200
01:57:19,830 --> 01:57:21,820
I feel like I wasted my youth.

1201
01:57:23,940 --> 01:57:27,490
You told me to hurry up and become NOX too!

1202
01:57:29,310 --> 01:57:32,830
I'm going to study more and more!

1203
01:57:32,850 --> 01:57:35,870
I'll work hard for people like you and Tetsuhiko!

1204
01:57:37,740 --> 01:57:42,030
It would be good if everyone was happier and lived a better life right?

1205
01:57:51,540 --> 01:57:53,310
What's wrong Dad?

1206
01:58:03,790 --> 01:58:04,960
What?

1207
01:58:05,730 --> 01:58:07,240
Why are you crying?

1208
01:58:09,970 --> 01:58:11,030
I don't know.

1209
01:58:17,450 --> 01:58:18,690
I don't know why...

1210
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:21,140
What's going on?

1211
01:58:21,150 --> 01:58:23,230
What's wrong Dad?

1212
01:58:25,610 --> 01:58:33,620
Even if you go to the other side...

1213
01:58:40,290 --> 01:58:41,480
Become excellent!

1214
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:44,670
Yeah!

1215
01:58:51,900 --> 01:58:52,920
Be healthy!

1216
01:58:54,650 --> 01:58:56,450
You're healthier than us now though...

1217
01:58:59,170 --> 01:59:00,100
Be careful!

1218
01:59:02,280 --> 01:59:02,990
Yeah!

1219
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:22,560
You'll be together with your new family.

1220
01:59:24,810 --> 01:59:25,440
Yeah.

1221
01:59:34,480 --> 01:59:40,310
It's okay if you forget about me and the village!

1222
01:59:43,570 --> 01:59:44,540
That's not true.

1223
01:59:54,360 --> 01:59:55,240
Go now!

1224
01:59:56,580 --> 01:59:57,470
They're waiting for you!

1225
02:00:00,010 --> 02:00:00,670
Yeah!

1226
02:00:06,270 --> 02:00:08,780
Thanks for everything Dad!

1227
02:00:20,170 --> 02:00:21,190
It's okay!

1228
02:00:22,070 --> 02:00:23,790
You won't catch anything by a handshake.

1229
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:02,930
Hey!

1230
02:04:32,220 --> 02:04:33,000
Oh crap!

1231
02:04:33,820 --> 02:04:36,020
There is a road that's not on the map!

1232
02:04:37,700 --> 02:04:38,560
Where is it?

1233
02:04:42,600 --> 02:04:45,710
Go where the sun is. That's the west.

1234
02:04:46,180 --> 02:04:47,430
There's no mistaking it!

1235
02:04:49,830 --> 02:04:50,810
Then it's a right!

1236
02:04:52,320 --> 02:04:53,070
Most likely.

1237
02:04:53,980 --> 02:04:55,150
I can't see it though.

1238
02:04:57,690 --> 02:04:58,630
Morishige!

1239
02:04:58,940 --> 02:05:00,240
Does your arm hurt?

1240
02:05:01,640 --> 02:05:04,770
If you can avoid the bumpy roads as much as possible, I'd appreciate it.

1241
02:05:05,870 --> 02:05:08,460
This car is old so it's quite bumpy.

1242
02:05:09,810 --> 02:05:12,240
It's been repaired quite a bit.

1243
02:05:13,330 --> 02:05:15,660
I bought this with my salary.

1244
02:05:23,570 --> 02:05:24,600
Alright....

1245
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:29,590
We'll change shifts when the Sun goes down!

1246
02:05:30,940 --> 02:05:31,600
Yeah!

1247
02:05:32,100 --> 02:05:32,980
Be careful!

1248
02:06:35,400 --> 02:08:37,400
Thanks for watching! Like my Facebook page at Rjgman56 japanese drama subs fanpage!
