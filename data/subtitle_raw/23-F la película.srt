1
00:02:40,087 --> 00:02:41,679
Well, l'm off.

2
00:02:45,567 --> 00:02:47,398
Everything alright, honey?

3
00:02:48,647 --> 00:02:49,796
Yes.

4
00:02:50,887 --> 00:02:52,002
l'll call you later.

5
00:03:28,887 --> 00:03:29,956
Spaniards...

6
00:03:31,887 --> 00:03:34,924
Franco... is dead.

7
00:04:47,207 --> 00:04:49,198
My leaving
is of more benefit to Spain

8
00:04:49,407 --> 00:04:51,204
than my remaining as president.

9
00:04:51,407 --> 00:04:53,841
And I do not wish a democratic
system of coexistence

10
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:57,598
to be once again a parenthesis
in the history of Spain.

11
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,519
...and send them before closing.

12
00:05:07,887 --> 00:05:10,196
Fine, we'll get to it then.

13
00:05:10,807 --> 00:05:12,763
-What are you smoking?
-Pall Mall.

14
00:05:13,007 --> 00:05:15,805
Pall Mall?
Where'd you get them from?

15
00:05:19,127 --> 00:05:20,879
Testing, testing...

16
00:05:21,367 --> 00:05:24,165
And you'll change your vote.

17
00:05:24,327 --> 00:05:26,602
l assure you, that won't happen.

18
00:05:30,007 --> 00:05:33,477
Since he resigned,
he hasn't been seen here.

19
00:05:33,807 --> 00:05:36,321
And just when it comes time to vote,
he turns up.

20
00:05:42,047 --> 00:05:43,799
Congress is in session.

21
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:51,478
This plenary session
has come together, as set out

22
00:05:51,687 --> 00:05:53,245
in Article 99 of the Constitution,

23
00:05:53,407 --> 00:05:54,999
to submit to a second vote

24
00:05:55,167 --> 00:05:57,886
the proposal of the candidate
for President of the Government

25
00:05:58,367 --> 00:06:00,756
as Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo.

26
00:06:04,127 --> 00:06:07,244
Next, the proposal of
the candidate for President,

27
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,523
Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo,

28
00:06:10,047 --> 00:06:13,278
who will take the podium
to again request

29
00:06:13,447 --> 00:06:15,244
a vote from the Chamber.

30
00:06:15,767 --> 00:06:16,836
17:41 MADRlD

31
00:06:17,007 --> 00:06:19,646
JUNTA OF THE CHlEFS OF STAFF

32
00:06:19,807 --> 00:06:21,525
At your orders, General.

33
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:42,918
Ladies and gentlemen of this Congress,
l take this podium

34
00:06:43,087 --> 00:06:46,284
only to confirm what l said
in my investiture speech

35
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:47,880
and in the subsequent debate

36
00:06:48,887 --> 00:06:52,163
to thank all parliamentary groups
for their contributions

37
00:06:52,327 --> 00:06:55,444
and to ask the Chamber again
for the vote of confidence

38
00:06:55,607 --> 00:06:59,156
according to Article 99
of the Constitution.

39
00:07:00,007 --> 00:07:01,076
Thank you.

40
00:07:07,887 --> 00:07:08,922
Yes?

41
00:07:12,207 --> 00:07:13,879
Yes. Everything as planned.

42
00:07:16,127 --> 00:07:19,085
You can locate me in Zarzuela,
as of 7 o'clock.

43
00:07:22,247 --> 00:07:25,398
You know the King is changeable,

44
00:07:25,727 --> 00:07:28,116
and even though he backs this,

45
00:07:28,807 --> 00:07:31,685
l'd rather be with him,
in the Palace.

46
00:07:32,407 --> 00:07:34,682
l don't trust Sabino.

47
00:07:37,047 --> 00:07:37,923
Yes.

48
00:07:38,567 --> 00:07:41,639
For any truly pressing matters,
call me there.

49
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:54,244
Gentlemen,

50
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,045
from now on there's no hesitation.

51
00:07:56,207 --> 00:07:56,844
ARMY HQ

52
00:07:57,007 --> 00:07:59,123
Orders will come at any moment.

53
00:07:59,287 --> 00:07:59,958
Excuse me.

54
00:08:03,207 --> 00:08:04,196
Yes?

55
00:08:04,447 --> 00:08:07,405
-Pedro, I'm very worried.
-Why?

56
00:08:07,647 --> 00:08:10,559
Damn. Because it's 57 past exactly.

57
00:08:11,127 --> 00:08:13,846
The distance from my ''estate'',

58
00:08:14,007 --> 00:08:16,885
worked out this morning,
was close to 1 hour.

59
00:08:17,047 --> 00:08:19,561
But the ''foreman'' was going to
tell you when he was leaving.

60
00:08:19,887 --> 00:08:22,196
l was told the ''variation''
would be at 25 past.

61
00:08:23,367 --> 00:08:25,722
-At 25 past!
-So ends the contribution

62
00:08:25,887 --> 00:08:28,117
from the Andalusian group.

63
00:08:28,287 --> 00:08:30,562
Next, the President of the Chamber

64
00:08:30,727 --> 00:08:31,762
will hand over to...

65
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:33,395
Sir, lgnacio and Miguel

66
00:08:33,567 --> 00:08:34,556
await you on the court.

67
00:08:34,767 --> 00:08:35,404
Good.

68
00:08:35,567 --> 00:08:37,080
And don't forget that around 8
Landelino is coming

69
00:08:37,247 --> 00:08:38,965
for the signing of the appointment.

70
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:43,047
Don't worry,
l'll finish them off quickly.

71
00:08:43,207 --> 00:08:45,323
Especially Miguel,
he's got a weak serve.

72
00:08:45,527 --> 00:08:47,085
...the most powerful sectors

73
00:08:47,367 --> 00:08:49,483
of this country's oligarchy,

74
00:08:49,647 --> 00:08:52,115
a policy that opposes
the interests...

75
00:09:08,007 --> 00:09:09,599
Right.

76
00:09:09,767 --> 00:09:11,359
You know what you have to do.

77
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,683
There's even a segment that says,

78
00:09:15,967 --> 00:09:18,197
''We must turn round and go back''.

79
00:09:18,367 --> 00:09:21,245
And another part of public opinion,

80
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,806
the majority in my judgement,

81
00:09:22,967 --> 00:09:26,004
believes that little has been done,
little progress has been made,

82
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:29,045
that the structure of the State
must be changed.

83
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:35,439
General, Carres calculates
that they'll arrive at 25 past.

84
00:10:26,047 --> 00:10:29,403
The vote will commence
with Deputy 114,

85
00:10:29,727 --> 00:10:31,558
Antonio Garcia Miralles.

86
00:10:49,487 --> 00:10:50,966
l'll go in first.

87
00:10:51,447 --> 00:10:54,917
Bovis, stay in the courtyard,
with those on the first bus.

88
00:10:55,887 --> 00:10:59,038
Vecinos, take the podium.
You know what to do.

89
00:11:00,167 --> 00:11:02,840
Corthay, you come inside with me.

90
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:04,475
Gentlemen.

91
00:11:10,927 --> 00:11:14,317
Guards!
This is in the name of the King!

92
00:11:15,367 --> 00:11:17,085
For Spain.

93
00:11:17,527 --> 00:11:19,563
-Long live Spain!
-Hurrah!

94
00:11:19,727 --> 00:11:21,524
Santiago Carrillo Solares.

95
00:11:22,087 --> 00:11:23,076
Nay.

96
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:36,555
C'mon, c'mon!

97
00:11:38,687 --> 00:11:42,396
-Faustino Munoz Garcia.
-Aye.

98
00:11:44,607 --> 00:11:45,801
Let's go! Let's go.

99
00:11:58,087 --> 00:12:00,555
-Cipriano Garcia Rollan.
-Nay.

100
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:03,355
-Alfonso Guerra Gonzalez.
-Nay.

101
00:12:03,567 --> 00:12:04,886
Take it easy, officer.

102
00:12:05,047 --> 00:12:07,117
-Out of the way!
-Stop right there!

103
00:12:07,287 --> 00:12:09,039
-Where are you going?
-Out of the way.

104
00:12:09,207 --> 00:12:09,923
Halt!

105
00:12:10,247 --> 00:12:12,841
By order of the King
and Valencian HQ,

106
00:12:13,007 --> 00:12:15,760
we're taking over Congress.
Take it easy...

107
00:12:15,927 --> 00:12:18,395
-For your own good.
-Armoured is about to arrive.

108
00:12:18,567 --> 00:12:19,920
-Freeze!
-Stay right there.

109
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:22,043
-For the King!
-For Spain!

110
00:12:24,407 --> 00:12:25,806
-Out of the way!
-Stop! Stop!

111
00:12:25,967 --> 00:12:26,956
Out of the way!

112
00:12:27,607 --> 00:12:28,801
Halt, you can't go past.

113
00:12:29,127 --> 00:12:30,401
Get to one side.

114
00:12:33,087 --> 00:12:35,317
C'mon, c'mon!

115
00:12:36,807 --> 00:12:39,037
Victor Zero! Attention, Victor Zero!
A group of Civil Guards...

116
00:12:39,327 --> 00:12:40,760
Put that away.

117
00:12:42,207 --> 00:12:43,560
Whose side are you on?

118
00:12:43,967 --> 00:12:46,606
-Pedro.
-Aye.

119
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:48,723
Enrique Mugica Herzog.

120
00:12:48,887 --> 00:12:49,956
Nay.

121
00:12:50,127 --> 00:12:51,640
-What is this? What do you want?
-On the floor!

122
00:12:51,807 --> 00:12:54,196
-l'm Commissioner Oria.
-l said, on the floor!

123
00:12:55,807 --> 00:12:57,001
On the floor!

124
00:12:59,927 --> 00:13:01,406
On the floor!

125
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,364
-Everyone hold it! On the floor!
-On the floor!

126
00:13:03,527 --> 00:13:04,596
Go up there.

127
00:13:05,207 --> 00:13:07,960
My men, with me. Move it!

128
00:13:08,607 --> 00:13:11,565
-Carlos Navarrete Merino.
-Nay.

129
00:13:16,807 --> 00:13:17,922
On the floor!

130
00:13:20,447 --> 00:13:21,562
On the floor!

131
00:13:23,287 --> 00:13:24,322
On the floor!

132
00:13:25,727 --> 00:13:28,321
Manuel Nunez Encabo.

133
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:35,436
Guards!

134
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,321
On the floor l said.

135
00:13:37,487 --> 00:13:39,045
Guard, no one is to move.

136
00:13:39,207 --> 00:13:42,995
A loud noise
has just been heard

137
00:13:43,167 --> 00:13:46,443
in the Chamber.
We don't know what it was because...

138
00:13:46,607 --> 00:13:48,006
One can see the police.

139
00:13:48,247 --> 00:13:50,044
The Civil Guard is entering.

140
00:14:03,647 --> 00:14:04,796
Everyone stay put!

141
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:10,246
Where are you going, Manolo?
Sit down.

142
00:14:10,407 --> 00:14:12,204
-Who's your leader?
-Sit down, Deputy.

143
00:14:12,367 --> 00:14:14,358
-Who's giving you orders?
-l told you to sit.

144
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,836
-Halt!
-Sit down!

145
00:14:16,007 --> 00:14:17,759
l order you to hand over that gun!

146
00:14:17,927 --> 00:14:19,246
Leave him alone!

147
00:14:36,047 --> 00:14:37,400
Every stay put! On the floor!

148
00:14:38,407 --> 00:14:41,001
Cease fire! Hold it!

149
00:14:41,927 --> 00:14:43,042
Hold it!

150
00:14:43,207 --> 00:14:45,482
You're going to hit one of ours!

151
00:14:48,647 --> 00:14:50,205
Unplug that camera! Unplug it!

152
00:14:51,607 --> 00:14:52,562
Give it to him!

153
00:14:52,727 --> 00:14:55,605
On the floor! And stay put!

154
00:14:58,167 --> 00:14:59,646
Sit down!

155
00:15:00,127 --> 00:15:01,879
Go back to your place.

156
00:15:02,047 --> 00:15:04,481
-l order you to be quiet, Captain.
-Sit down!

157
00:15:04,647 --> 00:15:05,284
Shut up!

158
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:07,039
-Manolo, sit down.
-Sit down!

159
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:08,356
Leave him alone!

160
00:15:09,527 --> 00:15:10,926
Manolo, please sit down.

161
00:15:12,087 --> 00:15:13,076
Sit down.

162
00:15:41,247 --> 00:15:43,920
Sabino, have you been listening
to the radio?

163
00:15:45,007 --> 00:15:46,599
Yes, come up, please.

164
00:15:55,967 --> 00:15:57,719
Put me through to State Security.

165
00:16:08,207 --> 00:16:11,483
lt's only a charity event
for widows and orphans.

166
00:16:12,487 --> 00:16:15,445
Perhaps you, Armada,
with your influence over the King,

167
00:16:15,687 --> 00:16:18,485
could slip him a word.

168
00:16:18,647 --> 00:16:20,683
Of course, General.

169
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:24,044
lf l may, General...
There are shots in Congress.

170
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,637
Shots? What do you mean?

171
00:16:26,807 --> 00:16:29,446
lt's on the radio.
Some Civil Guards came in shooting.

172
00:16:29,607 --> 00:16:31,359
lt looks like an assault.

173
00:16:31,687 --> 00:16:33,643
Good God.

174
00:16:34,967 --> 00:16:38,243
Olivenza, go straight to Congress.
Keep me informed.

175
00:16:38,407 --> 00:16:39,317
Yes, sir!

176
00:16:39,767 --> 00:16:40,916
Yes, Guillermo.

177
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:42,122
Yes, l heard.

178
00:16:43,327 --> 00:16:44,521
Excuse me. Armada...

179
00:16:48,767 --> 00:16:50,758
l'm leaving for Zarzuela, General.

180
00:16:53,047 --> 00:16:55,800
l think right now,
my duty is by the King's side.

181
00:16:56,207 --> 00:16:58,596
No, Armada. l need you here.

182
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:02,123
lf this is what l think it is,
we'll have to act under one command.

183
00:17:02,847 --> 00:17:04,519
Yes, Guillermo.

184
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,961
l'll call you back.

185
00:17:07,407 --> 00:17:08,283
Yes?

186
00:17:08,687 --> 00:17:11,599
This is shameful, Alfonso.
What a terrible country.

187
00:17:11,927 --> 00:17:14,760
Are they going to keep us
on the floor like rats all night?

188
00:17:14,927 --> 00:17:15,837
Come on!

189
00:17:17,007 --> 00:17:18,406
Keep your hands in sight!

190
00:17:18,687 --> 00:17:20,518
Your little hands
where l can see them!

191
00:17:23,087 --> 00:17:24,918
Everyone!

192
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:26,486
Everyone! You too!

193
00:17:28,207 --> 00:17:30,801
And you! Get those hands higher.

194
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:33,246
l can't see them!

195
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:34,876
Just a moment.

196
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,198
Sir, State Security.

197
00:17:39,127 --> 00:17:40,401
Laina, what's going on?

198
00:17:44,767 --> 00:17:45,722
ls anyone hurt?

199
00:17:47,407 --> 00:17:49,284
Just a moment. You see to it.

200
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,963
l can't now. Call back in 5 minutes.

201
00:17:58,207 --> 00:18:00,402
Gentlemen, no personal calls.

202
00:18:00,607 --> 00:18:02,404
We need the lines open.

203
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:06,036
Get my diary from my office.

204
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,686
And get Maria to make coffee.

205
00:18:11,847 --> 00:18:13,246
You know what you have to do.

206
00:18:19,607 --> 00:18:22,121
Please, talk to the deputies,
calm them down.

207
00:18:23,607 --> 00:18:25,563
Excuse me, given the circumstances,

208
00:18:25,727 --> 00:18:27,843
l refuse to exercise the presidency.

209
00:18:32,407 --> 00:18:34,443
...highly disturbed by events...

210
00:18:34,607 --> 00:18:36,757
What did you hear? A colonel?

211
00:18:37,087 --> 00:18:38,998
They said, a lieutenant colonel.

212
00:18:39,167 --> 00:18:40,759
Then the sound of gunfire.

213
00:18:41,207 --> 00:18:42,356
...15 minutes later

214
00:18:42,527 --> 00:18:45,325
Vice-President Calvo Sotelo,
in Congress...

215
00:18:45,487 --> 00:18:47,125
Do you think it was gunfire?

216
00:18:47,287 --> 00:18:50,324
The team phoned to say that

217
00:18:50,487 --> 00:18:52,398
during the incident,
First Vice-President,

218
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:55,206
Lt. Col. Gutierrez Mellado,
was struck...

219
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:58,200
Next the caller said not to worry.

220
00:19:31,607 --> 00:19:32,960
No, not a chance.

221
00:19:34,287 --> 00:19:35,606
-Thanks, Paco.
-Sir...

222
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,126
One moment, Nicolas.

223
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:40,083
lnform me as soon as
you find out anything.

224
00:19:46,407 --> 00:19:47,886
Where are Agustin and Jose?

225
00:19:49,447 --> 00:19:51,563
Call Fernando and everyone
from the Fourth.

226
00:19:51,727 --> 00:19:53,399
A crisis cabinet has to be set up.

227
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:55,076
Nicolas, please...

228
00:19:56,367 --> 00:19:59,245
-Office of the King.
-Yes, in 5 minutes.

229
00:20:00,647 --> 00:20:03,207
Laina says
they entered Congress in my name.

230
00:20:03,367 --> 00:20:06,404
l cannot consent to that.
Have you located them yet?

231
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:37,078
Where are you going?
On the floor!

232
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,477
On the floor!
Sit down.

233
00:20:41,567 --> 00:20:42,716
And don't get jumpy!

234
00:20:43,087 --> 00:20:46,159
Tejero! Get Tejero here!

235
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:50,159
Valencia's on the phone for you.

236
00:20:51,007 --> 00:20:53,567
-Where are the phones here?
-Down the end.

237
00:21:14,447 --> 00:21:16,324
-General?
-Antonio...

238
00:21:16,767 --> 00:21:20,157
Congratulations.
l heard it on the radio.

239
00:21:21,687 --> 00:21:23,405
You were magnificent.

240
00:21:23,967 --> 00:21:25,116
Thank you, General.

241
00:21:25,687 --> 00:21:27,757
The building
has been taken as planned.

242
00:21:28,367 --> 00:21:30,164
We have the government here,
a little cowed.

243
00:21:30,327 --> 00:21:30,998
Yes.

244
00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:32,680
But keep it all calm.

245
00:21:33,327 --> 00:21:36,444
Wait until ''H plus 2'' arrives.
Good luck,

246
00:21:36,607 --> 00:21:38,359
look out and get down to it.

247
00:21:38,527 --> 00:21:41,997
General, now we can say it out loud.

248
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,156
Long live Spain.

249
00:21:43,327 --> 00:21:44,362
Hurrah.

250
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:48,283
-Long live Spain, damn it!
-Hurrah!

251
00:21:49,047 --> 00:21:50,446
-Long live Spain!
-Hurrah!

252
00:21:50,607 --> 00:21:52,404
-Long live Spain!
-Hurrah!

253
00:21:52,567 --> 00:21:54,285
-Long live Spain!
-Hurrah!

254
00:21:54,807 --> 00:21:56,525
-Long live Spain!
-Hurrah!

255
00:22:15,487 --> 00:22:16,442
Okay! Great.

256
00:22:44,127 --> 00:22:46,083
Sorry about the delay.
How are things?

257
00:22:46,687 --> 00:22:47,961
Everything under control.

258
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:49,995
What about your men?

259
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:53,159
As agreed, l told them we're here
on manoeuvres. They understood,

260
00:22:53,327 --> 00:22:56,046
-and they're at your disposal.
-lncredible...

261
00:22:57,607 --> 00:23:00,041
My men were just incredible.

262
00:23:02,127 --> 00:23:03,685
l was worried about you.

263
00:23:04,047 --> 00:23:05,924
-There was traffic...
-Traffic?

264
00:23:06,287 --> 00:23:09,438
On the Valdemoro exit.
Did you think l chickened out?

265
00:23:12,287 --> 00:23:13,515
You?

266
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:16,685
You've got balls to spare.

267
00:23:22,847 --> 00:23:23,563
Welcome.

268
00:23:24,407 --> 00:23:26,443
-Thanks.
-Let's go.

269
00:23:27,527 --> 00:23:29,040
What are they doing here?

270
00:23:29,887 --> 00:23:31,843
Journalists, relatives,

271
00:23:32,127 --> 00:23:34,641
even diplomats wanting to call
their embassies.

272
00:23:34,807 --> 00:23:37,446
Throw them out.
We just want the people inside.

273
00:23:37,607 --> 00:23:39,438
-l need a favour.
-Whatever you want.

274
00:23:39,967 --> 00:23:41,605
You've got the gift of the gab.

275
00:23:41,967 --> 00:23:45,755
Why don't you go in and say
something to calm them down?

276
00:23:51,447 --> 00:23:52,846
You're not filming, are you?

277
00:23:56,567 --> 00:23:59,320
Good evening.
Nothing's going to happen,

278
00:24:00,207 --> 00:24:03,916
but we're going to wait for
the relevant military authority

279
00:24:04,087 --> 00:24:06,442
to state what is to be done,

280
00:24:06,607 --> 00:24:08,677
and what he has to declare.

281
00:24:09,767 --> 00:24:11,405
So stay calm.

282
00:24:11,887 --> 00:24:14,162
lt may be 15 or 20 minutes...

283
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:15,965
Unplug it or l'll kill you.

284
00:24:17,527 --> 00:24:20,087
...or half an hour, no longer,

285
00:24:20,647 --> 00:24:23,320
and the relevant authority,

286
00:24:23,487 --> 00:24:25,364
military of course,

287
00:24:25,567 --> 00:24:29,003
will determine
what is going to happen.

288
00:24:29,567 --> 00:24:31,159
Nothing's going to happen,

289
00:24:31,327 --> 00:24:33,079
so everyone stay calm.

290
00:24:33,247 --> 00:24:34,839
Mr. Suarez, remain in your seat!

291
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:38,283
-As President of the Government, l...
-Mr. Suarez, sit down!

292
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:40,200
Sit down, damn it!

293
00:24:57,367 --> 00:24:58,482
Guards!

294
00:24:59,087 --> 00:25:01,885
General Milans sends us
his warmest greetings.

295
00:25:03,967 --> 00:25:07,198
He has decreed a general mobilization.

296
00:25:19,087 --> 00:25:21,123
What do we know about
the Armoured Division?

297
00:25:21,287 --> 00:25:23,084
Relax. They'll be on their way.

298
00:25:23,247 --> 00:25:26,239
BRUNETE ARMOURED DlVlSlON

299
00:26:02,207 --> 00:26:04,960
Units of phase 1 of Operation Diana
waiting to depart, General.

300
00:26:05,127 --> 00:26:07,038
What are they waiting for?
Move out at once.

301
00:26:07,367 --> 00:26:08,163
Yes, sir.

302
00:26:25,807 --> 00:26:29,038
What's Juste doing here?
Shouldn't he be in Zaragoza?

303
00:26:29,847 --> 00:26:32,441
San Martin said he'd take him there,
on the excuse of manoeuvres.

304
00:26:33,487 --> 00:26:35,523
That was what was agreed with Milans.

305
00:26:41,207 --> 00:26:42,606
What's going on here?

306
00:26:44,327 --> 00:26:46,318
l remind you that you don't command
this division anymore.

307
00:26:46,487 --> 00:26:50,002
Look, Pepe, no one's disputing
that Armoured is under your orders.

308
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:52,635
But l'm here under orders
from Armada

309
00:26:52,807 --> 00:26:54,445
and the King.

310
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:56,957
The King?

311
00:26:57,127 --> 00:26:58,879
They ordered this operation.

312
00:27:04,567 --> 00:27:07,365
That changes matters.
Continue the operation.

313
00:27:07,527 --> 00:27:10,041
l'll confirm with Zarzuela
that everything's alright.

314
00:27:10,207 --> 00:27:11,526
Talk to Armada.

315
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:12,803
He'll explain.

316
00:27:12,967 --> 00:27:15,197
Stand to attention
when you address me, Commander.

317
00:27:20,927 --> 00:27:22,042
Don't worry,

318
00:27:22,687 --> 00:27:24,405
Pepe's one of us. l know him.

319
00:27:24,567 --> 00:27:26,523
How could l miss all this?

320
00:27:26,887 --> 00:27:28,286
You'd better be right.

321
00:27:28,767 --> 00:27:31,201
l gave my word to Milans
that Brunete would come out,

322
00:27:31,367 --> 00:27:33,164
and nothing or nobody
is going to stop me.

323
00:27:33,327 --> 00:27:34,601
Follow my instructions.

324
00:27:34,767 --> 00:27:37,042
That's right. Agreed.

325
00:27:37,207 --> 00:27:40,005
We need a command
to keep the units under control.

326
00:27:41,007 --> 00:27:43,965
We need to gather
the General Staff immediately.

327
00:27:46,487 --> 00:27:47,476
Hello, Pepe.

328
00:27:48,407 --> 00:27:49,886
lt's Juste.

329
00:27:50,847 --> 00:27:54,840
-Tell me, how are things going there?
-All in order.

330
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:58,283
The first units are out
and the tanks are set to take Madrid.

331
00:27:59,727 --> 00:28:01,479
What is this lunacy?

332
00:28:03,287 --> 00:28:04,845
What is it? What's he saying?

333
00:28:05,287 --> 00:28:08,040
The Armoured Division
is setting out to take Madrid.

334
00:28:09,767 --> 00:28:11,280
All units to barracks immediately

335
00:28:11,447 --> 00:28:13,244
and they're to stay there!

336
00:28:17,087 --> 00:28:18,156
To barracks?

337
00:28:18,487 --> 00:28:19,840
You heard.

338
00:28:20,687 --> 00:28:22,643
I don't understand at all...

339
00:28:23,007 --> 00:28:24,201
lsn't Armada there?

340
00:28:26,047 --> 00:28:27,878
Armada isn't here, nor is he expected.

341
00:28:28,047 --> 00:28:30,197
That certainly changes things.

342
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:32,640
Torres Rojas is here.

343
00:28:33,327 --> 00:28:34,919
Torres Rojas?

344
00:28:35,087 --> 00:28:37,601
He told me that Armada's there...

345
00:28:38,567 --> 00:28:40,683
and you'd given the order.

346
00:28:41,367 --> 00:28:42,686
-Sabino?
-Go ahead.

347
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:45,077
I don't know if I understand
what's happening.

348
00:28:46,847 --> 00:28:49,645
They're to follow our orders
and stay where they are.

349
00:28:50,927 --> 00:28:53,839
l have the King right here.
His orders are clear.

350
00:28:54,047 --> 00:28:56,356
He says: Do not let your troops out

351
00:28:57,087 --> 00:29:00,921
and do not listen to anyone,
not to Torres Rojas or to Armada.

352
00:29:01,087 --> 00:29:04,124
-No one!
-l'll keep the units on stand-down.

353
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:09,238
But the officers are fired up.

354
00:29:10,767 --> 00:29:12,678
It won't be easy
to maintain command.

355
00:29:12,847 --> 00:29:14,838
All the best, Pepe.

356
00:29:15,127 --> 00:29:18,005
Anyone who is not
a civil servant may leave.

357
00:29:18,767 --> 00:29:21,281
Journalists, guests,
and Security Forces,

358
00:29:21,447 --> 00:29:23,199
leave in an orderly fashion.

359
00:29:26,487 --> 00:29:28,523
We don't have the 3rd,
and the 4th is engaged.

360
00:29:28,687 --> 00:29:30,040
Are the Canaries secure?

361
00:29:30,207 --> 00:29:31,196
Please tell them...

362
00:29:31,367 --> 00:29:33,244
to call me at this number.

363
00:29:33,407 --> 00:29:34,203
We must insist.

364
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,802
-What do we know about the 4th?
-lt's still engaged.

365
00:29:37,967 --> 00:29:39,116
Keep at the ready.

366
00:29:39,287 --> 00:29:42,882
-l'll put you through.
-We don't have the 3rd.

367
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:45,038
The 4th is engaged,
nothing on the 5th and 6th.

368
00:29:45,207 --> 00:29:47,198
l've been trying to get on to him
for over half an hour.

369
00:29:47,847 --> 00:29:51,283
l'll confirm it to you
as soon as l can.

370
00:29:51,687 --> 00:29:53,678
l can't tell you.
He's to call this number.

371
00:29:53,847 --> 00:29:54,836
Yes, he's here.

372
00:29:56,967 --> 00:29:57,683
Armada!

373
00:30:00,207 --> 00:30:01,242
lt's for you.

374
00:30:07,567 --> 00:30:11,116
l know he's been talking
to politicians lately,

375
00:30:12,287 --> 00:30:14,164
looking for situations
in the Constitution

376
00:30:14,327 --> 00:30:16,716
that would legitimize
an crisis government

377
00:30:16,887 --> 00:30:18,525
presided over by a military man.

378
00:30:18,687 --> 00:30:21,565
-Obviously, Armada himself.
-lt was crazy talk.

379
00:30:21,847 --> 00:30:24,281
The problem is that Armada,
in military eyes,

380
00:30:24,967 --> 00:30:27,242
after so many years in the Household,

381
00:30:27,687 --> 00:30:29,086
is linked to the King.

382
00:30:29,407 --> 00:30:32,240
lt's possible he's convinced
some of the military

383
00:30:32,407 --> 00:30:34,125
that a decisive blow

384
00:30:35,007 --> 00:30:37,396
would be approved of by Your Majesty.

385
00:30:41,767 --> 00:30:43,598
l know the Army.

386
00:30:44,487 --> 00:30:46,955
Many of them
crave a return to the past,

387
00:30:47,127 --> 00:30:48,879
but l've always
made it clear that their duty

388
00:30:49,127 --> 00:30:50,640
is to the Constitution
over and above the King!

389
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,320
The Constitution...

390
00:30:52,647 --> 00:30:55,207
A lot of them are still ruled
by Franco's testament.

391
00:30:55,367 --> 00:30:57,722
And according to that,
they owe you obedience.

392
00:31:00,527 --> 00:31:03,519
One must tread carefully.
Your Majesty, you should...

393
00:31:03,687 --> 00:31:04,437
Let's go back.

394
00:31:04,767 --> 00:31:06,678
l have to speak to
the Commanding Generals.

395
00:31:06,847 --> 00:31:09,315
-Sabino, try to speak to Tejero.
-Very well.

396
00:31:17,447 --> 00:31:18,436
l've got him.

397
00:31:22,887 --> 00:31:25,162
Lt. Colonel,
l'm putting a call through.

398
00:31:30,127 --> 00:31:31,196
Yes, go ahead.

399
00:31:31,367 --> 00:31:33,483
This is Gen. Sabino Fernandez Campos,

400
00:31:33,647 --> 00:31:35,558
General Secretary
of the Royal Household.

401
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:38,676
Yes. How are you?

402
00:31:38,887 --> 00:31:40,764
Did you want something?

403
00:31:40,927 --> 00:31:42,360
Did l want something?

404
00:31:42,807 --> 00:31:44,206
Have you gone mad?

405
00:31:44,367 --> 00:31:46,403
How dare you enter
in the King's name?

406
00:31:46,927 --> 00:31:50,124
ln the name of His Majesty,
leave Congress immediately!

407
00:31:50,887 --> 00:31:54,516
l only obey orders from
the Commanding General of Valencia!

408
00:31:57,327 --> 00:32:00,046
-What did he say?
-That he only obeys Milans.

409
00:32:00,847 --> 00:32:02,326
Milans...

410
00:32:06,087 --> 00:32:07,486
lmpossible.

411
00:32:08,487 --> 00:32:10,876
Jaime would never
rise up against the King.

412
00:32:11,367 --> 00:32:13,119
But for the King, yes.

413
00:32:13,687 --> 00:32:16,884
Guard, get me through to
the number l gave you before.

414
00:32:20,407 --> 00:32:22,284
Milans is a good friend of Armada.

415
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:25,198
They fought
in the Blue Division together.

416
00:32:27,247 --> 00:32:28,760
Get me Armada and Milans.

417
00:32:29,527 --> 00:32:33,122
-Call the rest of the HQ's!
-We're on it, sir.

418
00:33:02,967 --> 00:33:04,036
Guards!

419
00:33:04,287 --> 00:33:07,279
Obey no orders but mine!

420
00:33:07,727 --> 00:33:09,922
Who the hell is in command?

421
00:33:10,847 --> 00:33:13,566
You men!
Get on the buses going back!

422
00:33:13,887 --> 00:33:17,721
Juan, start moving, the unit
is to get here as soon as possible.

423
00:33:17,887 --> 00:33:19,400
Then ''that gentleman''
has to be called.

424
00:33:19,847 --> 00:33:23,362
He told me not to forget ''H Plus 2'',
that's when the unit has to arrive.

425
00:33:27,327 --> 00:33:29,795
Give me the number
where l can contact you.

426
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:31,366
l'm here in the Congress Building.

427
00:33:31,527 --> 00:33:33,199
Give me the number, damn it.

428
00:33:33,367 --> 00:33:35,756
General Aramburu is here.
He want to take away the Guards.

429
00:33:38,607 --> 00:33:39,801
Excuse me,

430
00:33:40,047 --> 00:33:42,925
we have orders to obey
only immediate superiors.

431
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:44,042
lmmediate...?

432
00:33:44,447 --> 00:33:46,961
l'm the Head of the Civil Guard!

433
00:33:47,207 --> 00:33:47,957
Arrest him!

434
00:33:48,127 --> 00:33:50,402
-You'll see who's in command here!
-Come with me.

435
00:33:50,567 --> 00:33:53,206
You! Back on the buses!
Everybody on!

436
00:33:53,887 --> 00:33:55,843
You're a disgrace to the Corps!

437
00:34:07,727 --> 00:34:09,160
Here he is.

438
00:34:09,687 --> 00:34:11,006
The great man.

439
00:34:12,447 --> 00:34:13,721
General.

440
00:34:16,567 --> 00:34:19,127
Give up, Antonio.
Put a stop to this madness.

441
00:34:22,967 --> 00:34:25,162
-That's an order!
-l only obey orders

442
00:34:25,327 --> 00:34:26,840
from the Commanding General
of Valencia.

443
00:34:27,007 --> 00:34:28,406
-Careful!
-Drop the gun!

444
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:31,684
-Seize that man!
-l will not surrender, General!

445
00:34:38,007 --> 00:34:39,884
One more step,

446
00:34:40,527 --> 00:34:43,803
and l'll shoot you
and turn the gun on myself.

447
00:34:56,567 --> 00:34:59,286
-This is over!
-No, no! General!

448
00:34:59,647 --> 00:35:00,318
No, General.

449
00:35:00,687 --> 00:35:02,837
lt'd mean a massacre. Let's leave.

450
00:35:17,487 --> 00:35:19,045
Calm yourself, General.

451
00:35:19,847 --> 00:35:22,156
The main thing now
is to set up a command centre nearby,

452
00:35:22,327 --> 00:35:23,726
to keep an eye on them.

453
00:35:29,767 --> 00:35:30,756
Excuse me, sir...

454
00:35:31,487 --> 00:35:32,715
Yes. One moment.

455
00:35:33,287 --> 00:35:36,324
Laina suggests that all Secretaries
and Sub-secretaries of State meet

456
00:35:36,487 --> 00:35:38,045
to form a provisional government.

457
00:35:38,207 --> 00:35:40,198
-What do you think?
-lt's a good idea.

458
00:35:40,407 --> 00:35:41,806
That'll avoid a power vacuum.

459
00:35:46,687 --> 00:35:49,201
Go ahead, Paco.
Gather as soon as possible.

460
00:35:50,647 --> 00:35:52,160
Excuse me, Sabino.

461
00:35:53,727 --> 00:35:56,525
Pascual, are you still there?
Listen carefully.

462
00:35:56,727 --> 00:35:58,718
No, no, listen.

463
00:35:58,887 --> 00:35:59,922
Don't do anything.

464
00:36:00,087 --> 00:36:01,839
Remain in your barracks.

465
00:36:03,527 --> 00:36:05,836
Don't you give that
''unique-opportunity'' line too!

466
00:36:06,007 --> 00:36:08,316
That's a direct order,
do you understand?

467
00:36:15,527 --> 00:36:17,802
-Go ahead.
-l've just spoken to Armada.

468
00:36:18,407 --> 00:36:20,477
He denies any knowledge
of what's happening.

469
00:36:21,007 --> 00:36:24,443
He insisted
on coming here to help us.

470
00:36:25,007 --> 00:36:26,281
What did you tell him?

471
00:36:26,447 --> 00:36:28,642
That he's more useful to us
at General Staff.

472
00:36:31,487 --> 00:36:32,840
Good.

473
00:36:35,127 --> 00:36:38,597
For greater security,
call the Somontes checkpoint and...

474
00:36:40,967 --> 00:36:44,198
order them not to let him in
if he presents himself.

475
00:36:45,407 --> 00:36:47,796
l've taken that liberty, sir.

476
00:36:50,087 --> 00:36:52,647
-You're all journalists.
-Yes, sir.

477
00:36:53,487 --> 00:36:54,920
Why didn't you say so before?

478
00:36:55,887 --> 00:36:57,798
-Well...
-Fine.

479
00:37:00,207 --> 00:37:01,276
Get going.

480
00:37:01,687 --> 00:37:04,679
But the film and cameras stay here.

481
00:37:26,967 --> 00:37:28,082
Madam.

482
00:37:31,127 --> 00:37:33,118
-How are you?
-Fine.

483
00:37:33,767 --> 00:37:37,043
l spoke to London.
My brother sends you a hug.

484
00:37:38,247 --> 00:37:41,080
-Are the children alright?
-l'm trying not to let them worry.

485
00:37:41,327 --> 00:37:43,887
Cristina and Elena
keep asking me what's happening.

486
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:45,683
And Felipe?

487
00:37:46,167 --> 00:37:49,045
-ln his room.
-Tell him to come, please.

488
00:37:49,647 --> 00:37:50,762
7:32 P.M. MADRlD

489
00:37:50,927 --> 00:37:52,758
SPANlSH TV, PRADO DEL REY

490
00:37:52,927 --> 00:37:54,246
Everyone stay put!

491
00:37:54,687 --> 00:37:57,360
-Silence!
-Stay put!

492
00:38:10,167 --> 00:38:12,317
Here they are! We've got to hurry!

493
00:38:39,807 --> 00:38:42,367
We're taking control here.

494
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:44,759
No news.

495
00:38:45,287 --> 00:38:47,323
Broadcast what you like, but no news.

496
00:38:48,087 --> 00:38:49,361
ls that clear?

497
00:38:53,807 --> 00:38:57,720
We've also ordered National Radio
to only broadcast military marches.

498
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,315
You!

499
00:39:01,647 --> 00:39:02,841
Get me a transistor.

500
00:39:03,047 --> 00:39:05,038
l want to check that
our orders have been obeyed.

501
00:39:05,767 --> 00:39:06,882
Didn't you bring one?

502
00:39:07,807 --> 00:39:09,877
l mean,
l don't have a transistor here.

503
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:11,282
This is a TV station.

504
00:39:11,447 --> 00:39:14,405
We don't have ''transistors'' here.

505
00:39:15,367 --> 00:39:17,164
How can that be?

506
00:39:22,247 --> 00:39:24,522
Men, turn all this upside-down,

507
00:39:24,687 --> 00:39:26,359
but find me a fucking radio!

508
00:39:26,807 --> 00:39:30,197
-What do we know about Barcelona?
-Nothing, we know nothing.

509
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:31,880
-And Granada?
-Delgado Alvarez,

510
00:39:32,167 --> 00:39:35,443
-we have his full support.
-His Majesty has to talk to them.

511
00:39:36,087 --> 00:39:36,758
Seville...

512
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:38,486
The Captain-General
isn't answering the phone.

513
00:39:38,647 --> 00:39:41,400
Merry Gordon.
Keep calling him.

514
00:39:41,807 --> 00:39:44,685
And if they don't answer,
send them a teletype!

515
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:47,077
-Go ahead, Juanillo.
-Antonio...

516
00:39:47,247 --> 00:39:50,319
There a many of us behind you.
lmportant people, very important.

517
00:39:50,727 --> 00:39:51,682
Listen.

518
00:39:53,447 --> 00:39:55,517
Military marches on National Radio.

519
00:39:56,367 --> 00:39:59,245
-You don't say!
-Yes! Keep that morale high!

520
00:40:00,167 --> 00:40:03,557
Guards!
Military marches on National Radio!

521
00:40:04,887 --> 00:40:06,923
Keep up that morale!

522
00:40:07,087 --> 00:40:09,317
Listen to them! Listen to them!

523
00:40:19,487 --> 00:40:21,478
Let's get the ones l told you about.

524
00:40:26,487 --> 00:40:28,603
Military marches on National Radio.

525
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:30,716
Alfonso,

526
00:40:30,967 --> 00:40:32,923

527
00:40:36,727 --> 00:40:38,683

Military marches on National Radio.

532
00:40:50,527 --> 00:40:51,562
Adolfo,

533
00:40:51,767 --> 00:40:54,156
they're broadcasting military marches

534
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:55,965
on National Radio.

535
00:41:10,647 --> 00:41:11,636
You...

536
00:41:12,367 --> 00:41:13,880
come with me.

537
00:41:36,447 --> 00:41:37,766
Gentlemen...

538
00:41:38,607 --> 00:41:42,441
Gen. Milans del Bosch
just declared a state of siege.

539
00:41:43,207 --> 00:41:44,765
We shall read out the decree.

540
00:41:44,927 --> 00:41:48,761
Don Jaime Milans del Bosch y Ussia,

541
00:41:48,927 --> 00:41:49,723
Lt. General...

542
00:41:49,887 --> 00:41:52,003
You two, come with me.

543
00:41:52,167 --> 00:41:54,203
...Captain-General, 3rd Region...

544
00:41:54,847 --> 00:41:55,962
Let's go.

545
00:41:56,127 --> 00:41:57,879
...given the events

546
00:41:58,127 --> 00:42:01,802
taking place
in the capital of Spain,...

547
00:42:02,047 --> 00:42:03,400
You, follow me!

548
00:42:04,047 --> 00:42:07,960
it is my duty to guarantee order
in my military region

549
00:42:08,127 --> 00:42:11,039
until receiving instructions

550
00:42:11,207 --> 00:42:13,516
from His Majesty the King.

551
00:42:13,687 --> 00:42:15,996
l therefore declare:

552
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:17,680
Article 1 :

553
00:42:18,007 --> 00:42:22,000
All civil service personnel

554
00:42:22,487 --> 00:42:25,559
are to be militarized,
with the duties and powers

555
00:42:25,727 --> 00:42:26,921
set down by law.

556
00:42:27,087 --> 00:42:30,079
Contact with armed military units

557
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:32,283
by the civil population
is prohibited.

558
00:42:32,447 --> 00:42:34,836
These units will repel

559
00:42:35,007 --> 00:42:37,237
without intimidation or warning

560
00:42:37,407 --> 00:42:40,399
all aggressions they may encounter
with the greatest force.

561
00:42:41,327 --> 00:42:43,124
Similarly repelled will be

562
00:42:43,287 --> 00:42:45,960
aggressive action against buildings,
water and light utilities...

563
00:42:48,167 --> 00:42:51,159
All public and private activity

564
00:42:51,327 --> 00:42:53,557
by political parties is suppressed,

565
00:42:53,727 --> 00:42:56,366
similarly banning the gathering

566
00:42:56,527 --> 00:42:58,199
of more than four people.

567
00:42:58,447 --> 00:43:02,326
It is established...

568
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:06,086
that family groups

569
00:43:06,247 --> 00:43:08,397
in their respective...

570
00:43:09,967 --> 00:43:12,401
All state security bodies

571
00:43:12,567 --> 00:43:14,842
will remain under my authority.

572
00:43:15,367 --> 00:43:17,835
Similarly, I assumejudicial

573
00:43:18,007 --> 00:43:19,884
and administrative power,

574
00:43:20,047 --> 00:43:21,321
at the regional...

575
00:43:25,607 --> 00:43:27,484
The rules will remain valid

576
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:30,207
for a strictly limited period

577
00:43:30,367 --> 00:43:32,756
until instructions from His Majesty

578
00:43:32,927 --> 00:43:34,883
or High Command are received.

579
00:43:35,647 --> 00:43:38,400
For all this,
I shall finish with a hearty:

580
00:43:38,567 --> 00:43:41,035
Long live the King!
Long live Spain!

581
00:43:48,127 --> 00:43:49,355
On the right.

582
00:44:12,127 --> 00:44:13,355
Go ahead, gentlemen.

583
00:44:16,167 --> 00:44:18,283
You two, down the end.

584
00:44:19,727 --> 00:44:20,682
Quickly.

585
00:44:21,487 --> 00:44:24,718
Mr. Rodriguez Sahagun.
Next to the table.

586
00:44:27,447 --> 00:44:29,358
You two, there.

587
00:44:38,807 --> 00:44:41,560
May one enquire why there are tanks
in the streets? By what right?

588
00:44:41,727 --> 00:44:44,321
They're only some units
returning from manoeuvres.

589
00:44:44,527 --> 00:44:46,358
Manoeuvres?
Do you take me for a fool?

590
00:44:48,047 --> 00:44:50,197
Withdraw those units at once!

591
00:44:50,407 --> 00:44:51,886
And call Zarzuela,

592
00:44:52,167 --> 00:44:55,079
the King's been trying all evening
to speak to you.

593
00:44:55,247 --> 00:44:56,680
I will, General.

594
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:59,285
ls Armada there?

595
00:45:01,127 --> 00:45:02,276
Armada?

596
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:16,875
General.

597
00:45:17,767 --> 00:45:19,883
How are things in Valencia?

598
00:45:20,687 --> 00:45:24,362
What the hell are you doing there?
You're meant to be with the King.

599
00:45:24,527 --> 00:45:25,801
Of course, but...

600
00:45:26,127 --> 00:45:29,324
l'll try to speak to him
sometime tonight.

601
00:45:29,487 --> 00:45:30,442
Do so.

602
00:45:31,207 --> 00:45:34,722
You have to protect the King
from bad influences.

603
00:45:35,927 --> 00:45:37,485
And, if need be,

604
00:45:38,247 --> 00:45:40,522
protect the King
from the King himself.

605
00:45:40,727 --> 00:45:42,445
l'll do what l can.

606
00:45:45,767 --> 00:45:48,565
Armada, why is everyone
asking me about you?

607
00:45:51,407 --> 00:45:55,036
Since l've had some contact...

608
00:45:55,207 --> 00:45:57,721
with politicians of late...

609
00:45:57,967 --> 00:45:59,878
Armada, you and l are soldiers.

610
00:46:01,367 --> 00:46:03,039
Let's leave politics
to the professionals.

611
00:46:03,207 --> 00:46:06,119
They're doing a bad enough job
on their own.

612
00:46:17,607 --> 00:46:19,837
l'm leaving for
the Junta of the General Staff.

613
00:46:20,407 --> 00:46:22,682
l'm counting on you to
keep things calm here.

614
00:46:32,167 --> 00:46:33,566
lt's an extraordinary night

615
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:35,206
for our country.

616
00:46:35,367 --> 00:46:36,880
We're here at the Palace Hotel,

617
00:46:37,047 --> 00:46:38,116
in front of Congress.

618
00:46:38,807 --> 00:46:41,765
Meeting right now

619
00:46:41,927 --> 00:46:44,395
are the Head of the Civil Guard,
Aramburu Topete,

620
00:46:44,727 --> 00:46:47,241
and representatives of
the Police and the Army.

621
00:46:47,487 --> 00:46:49,478
ln coordination with
State Security Forces,

622
00:46:49,647 --> 00:46:52,366
they're trying to determine
what measures to take

623
00:46:52,527 --> 00:46:54,199
at this crucial time.

624
00:46:54,367 --> 00:46:57,200
Yes, Father,
l've just spoken to all the HQs.

625
00:46:57,367 --> 00:46:59,642
lt seems it's an isolated incident,
only seconded by the Third,

626
00:46:59,807 --> 00:47:01,286
but l've insisted that Gabeiras

627
00:47:01,447 --> 00:47:04,007
maintain full control
of the Armed Forces.

628
00:47:04,527 --> 00:47:06,279
What about the General StaffE?

629
00:47:08,567 --> 00:47:10,558
They're meeting now.

630
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:13,161
A meeting of the Secretaries
has also been called

631
00:47:13,327 --> 00:47:15,204
in order to establish
a provisional government.

632
00:47:15,607 --> 00:47:19,236
Son, this isn't the first time
our family has faced this.

633
00:47:20,127 --> 00:47:23,199
My father had to do it,
and your grandfather before him.

634
00:47:23,527 --> 00:47:25,757
These are difficult times, Father.

635
00:47:26,767 --> 00:47:29,406
But don't worry,
we'll get through this.

636
00:47:30,367 --> 00:47:33,723
I'm sure you'll be up to it.

637
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:36,683
I know you hold Spain in your heart

638
00:47:37,207 --> 00:47:39,767
and you'll defend her
with all your courage.

639
00:47:40,887 --> 00:47:44,084
Majesty... Long live Spain!

640
00:47:47,287 --> 00:47:49,039
Thank you, Father.

641
00:47:49,887 --> 00:47:51,320
l know l can count on you.

642
00:47:51,767 --> 00:47:53,758
l'll call back when l can.

643
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,846
Goodbye.

644
00:48:04,327 --> 00:48:06,363
l want you to pay close attention
to what's going on today.

645
00:48:08,127 --> 00:48:10,083
This is a very important day for us.

646
00:48:11,127 --> 00:48:12,526
Take a seat.

647
00:48:16,967 --> 00:48:19,845
Sabino! l need to address
the nation as soon as possible.

648
00:48:20,007 --> 00:48:22,202
The people need to know
the Crown's position.

649
00:48:42,687 --> 00:48:43,915
Castedo, go ahead.

650
00:48:44,807 --> 00:48:46,365
Fernando. This is Sabino.

651
00:48:48,047 --> 00:48:50,322
The King wants you
to send a crew to Zarzuela.

652
00:48:50,487 --> 00:48:52,159
He wants to send
a message to the country.

653
00:48:52,727 --> 00:48:54,365
No, tell him l'm in a meeting.

654
00:48:56,527 --> 00:48:59,724
-Do you have people in your office?
-Yes.

655
00:49:00,287 --> 00:49:01,561
Civilian or military?

656
00:49:02,807 --> 00:49:03,603
The latter.

657
00:49:03,887 --> 00:49:06,162
The latter, on UHF.

658
00:49:07,007 --> 00:49:10,283
You've got military men
in your office?

659
00:49:10,567 --> 00:49:12,205
That's right.

660
00:49:12,487 --> 00:49:14,443
We'll do what we can
to get them out of there.

661
00:49:14,727 --> 00:49:15,955
Alright.

662
00:49:22,047 --> 00:49:23,082
Captain.

663
00:49:27,527 --> 00:49:29,483
Quintana Lacaci on the phone.

664
00:49:29,647 --> 00:49:31,956
l'm only here for my commander.
Hang up.

665
00:49:32,127 --> 00:49:33,606
And if he calls again,
hang up again!

666
00:49:45,367 --> 00:49:48,359
You and l fought in the War
on opposite sides,

667
00:49:49,687 --> 00:49:50,517
but...

668
00:49:53,087 --> 00:49:54,884
you might accept one from me.

669
00:49:55,647 --> 00:49:57,126
l'd be grateful.

670
00:50:18,767 --> 00:50:20,519
l wanted to give up smoking,

671
00:50:20,687 --> 00:50:23,042
because of this damn bronchitis.

672
00:51:30,607 --> 00:51:33,360
The situation is quite complicated.

673
00:51:33,767 --> 00:51:35,280
There are over 50 tanks.

674
00:51:35,607 --> 00:51:36,835
All the best.

675
00:51:37,047 --> 00:51:38,685
50 tanks...

676
00:51:39,687 --> 00:51:42,565
You have to put me in touch
with Milans, any way you can.

677
00:51:43,887 --> 00:51:44,558
What did he say?

678
00:51:44,807 --> 00:51:47,002
He won't speak to
Quintana or Gabeiras.

679
00:51:47,167 --> 00:51:48,680
He refuses to leave.

680
00:51:48,847 --> 00:51:51,645
He says he only obey orders
from immediate superiors.

681
00:51:52,647 --> 00:51:54,842
lt's a detachment from Villaviciosa.

682
00:51:57,047 --> 00:52:00,198
You've always been
on close terms with the Cavalry.

683
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,119
Have you got friends
in that detachment?

684
00:52:02,287 --> 00:52:03,197
Yes, sir.

685
00:52:03,567 --> 00:52:06,081
Those crews have to leave
the TV building.

686
00:52:06,247 --> 00:52:08,715
Taping an image
is a top priority, Nicolas.

687
00:52:08,887 --> 00:52:10,878
Alright. l'll see what l can do.

688
00:52:11,047 --> 00:52:12,400
Thank you.

689
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:15,720
304, Herrero de Minon...

690
00:52:19,687 --> 00:52:22,406
305, Ernest Lluc...

691
00:52:29,287 --> 00:52:30,925
300...

692
00:52:33,687 --> 00:52:35,359
Count away.

693
00:52:36,767 --> 00:52:40,442
Like we counted on you,
while you people did nothing.

694
00:52:41,607 --> 00:52:43,165
What are you talking about?

695
00:52:44,967 --> 00:52:47,197
Over 80 last year alone.

696
00:52:48,927 --> 00:52:50,440
They had wives...

697
00:52:51,487 --> 00:52:52,681
...children...

698
00:52:53,287 --> 00:52:55,118
And you never even went
to their funerals.

699
00:52:56,007 --> 00:52:58,396
l stopped when the wives
looked at me the way you are now.

700
00:52:58,687 --> 00:53:00,996
You didn't have the balls
to look them in they eye!

701
00:53:01,167 --> 00:53:02,361
Listen to me!

702
00:53:13,447 --> 00:53:16,484
l've spent many sleepless nights
searching for a solution.

703
00:53:18,607 --> 00:53:20,199
A solution?

704
00:53:30,087 --> 00:53:31,281
An iron fist.

705
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:34,039
There is no other solution.

706
00:53:35,247 --> 00:53:37,886
That's why we had to intervene.

707
00:53:39,167 --> 00:53:41,283
Because you didn't have the courage
to take steps.

708
00:53:41,527 --> 00:53:44,200
lt's easy to be brave
when you're aiming at an unarmed man.

709
00:53:46,207 --> 00:53:49,005
You unarmed people
are the most dangerous of all.

710
00:53:50,047 --> 00:53:52,436
You only drag Spain down

711
00:53:52,607 --> 00:53:54,438
with laws, from inside your offices,

712
00:53:54,607 --> 00:53:56,802
while outside
Civil Guards risks their lives!

713
00:53:57,087 --> 00:53:58,679
-Look...
-No, you look.

714
00:53:58,847 --> 00:54:01,486
Who's to blame that we're here?

715
00:54:03,367 --> 00:54:04,846
Are we?

716
00:54:05,327 --> 00:54:07,761
We're not, that's for sure.

717
00:54:17,447 --> 00:54:18,960
Sir, if you'll let me...

718
00:54:21,207 --> 00:54:22,765
Are you sure, sir?

719
00:54:26,327 --> 00:54:27,316
Yes.

720
00:54:29,007 --> 00:54:30,759
At your orders, sir.

721
00:54:35,967 --> 00:54:37,036
Get the men.

722
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:38,196
We're leaving.

723
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:41,645
l gather l'm now back in charge
of this establishment

724
00:54:41,807 --> 00:54:44,002
and can broadcast what l like.

725
00:54:44,487 --> 00:54:46,318
Do what you like.

726
00:55:11,047 --> 00:55:12,321
Manises hasn't come out.

727
00:55:14,047 --> 00:55:15,878
Brunete hasn't come out.

728
00:55:20,167 --> 00:55:22,806
Anyway, sooner or later
you'll have to talk to him.

729
00:55:38,327 --> 00:55:39,555
Majesty.

730
00:55:40,887 --> 00:55:42,764
Jaime, what are you doing?

731
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:45,760
l'm trying to preserve order,
that's all.

732
00:55:46,367 --> 00:55:48,483
At a time like this
one has to protect the monarchy,

733
00:55:48,687 --> 00:55:52,157
protect the King,
and wait for events to unfold.

734
00:55:52,367 --> 00:55:54,597
Protect me from what?

735
00:55:54,807 --> 00:55:56,160
From whom?

736
00:55:56,447 --> 00:55:58,483
Wasn't it you people
who started this?

737
00:55:58,887 --> 00:56:00,240
Not at all.

738
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:03,406
This is a one-off, it's some zealot.

739
00:56:04,207 --> 00:56:06,675
-Right.
-It's understandable,

740
00:56:06,847 --> 00:56:08,360
given this country's situation.

741
00:56:08,527 --> 00:56:09,755
The Army saw its duty as...

742
00:56:09,927 --> 00:56:12,999
Jaime, you must revoke that
decree now.

743
00:56:13,167 --> 00:56:15,522
Or l'll have to declare you
as being in rebellion.

744
00:56:17,007 --> 00:56:18,486
Majesty...

745
00:56:21,367 --> 00:56:22,766
Armada told me last night.

746
00:56:22,967 --> 00:56:23,956
You spoke to Armada?

747
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:28,881
Sir, you'd have to see
the mood of the troops.

748
00:56:29,807 --> 00:56:31,798
They're just waiting for you
to give the word

749
00:56:31,967 --> 00:56:32,956
and they'll take to the streets.

750
00:56:33,127 --> 00:56:35,516
Revoke that decree
or suffer the consequences!

751
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:38,718
Have I made that clear?

752
00:56:39,887 --> 00:56:41,479
Yes, sir.

753
00:56:42,327 --> 00:56:44,716
But I beg you,
try to speak to Armada.

754
00:56:47,287 --> 00:56:50,040
lt seems that five politicians,

755
00:56:50,207 --> 00:56:52,004
as well as Adolfo Suarez,

756
00:56:52,287 --> 00:56:54,005
have been taken away...

757
00:56:54,407 --> 00:56:55,806
Latest news.

758
00:56:55,967 --> 00:56:59,926
Attention, attention,
this very moment,

759
00:57:00,087 --> 00:57:02,317
at 9:03 p.m.,

760
00:57:02,487 --> 00:57:03,636
we've received a note,

761
00:57:03,807 --> 00:57:06,560
a communique from
the Ministry of the lnterior

762
00:57:06,727 --> 00:57:09,195
informing of the establishment
of a provisional government.

763
00:57:09,607 --> 00:57:11,723
Under the orders of
His Majesty the King,

764
00:57:11,887 --> 00:57:13,559
and presided over by
Francisco Laina,

765
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:17,686
this government's aim is to ensure
the governability of the State.

766
00:57:17,927 --> 00:57:21,044
Given the circumstances,
the Secretaries of State

767
00:57:21,207 --> 00:57:23,562
and their Sub-secretaries,

768
00:57:23,727 --> 00:57:26,480
have come together,

769
00:57:26,647 --> 00:57:27,523
on the orders

770
00:57:27,687 --> 00:57:29,040
of His Majesty the King,

771
00:57:29,287 --> 00:57:30,356
to ensure

772
00:57:30,527 --> 00:57:33,724
the governing of the country
in civilian hands

773
00:57:34,007 --> 00:57:38,000
and it remains in close contact
with the General StaffE,

774
00:57:38,367 --> 00:57:40,164
who are also meeting.

775
00:57:40,847 --> 00:57:42,838
Gabeiras,
how are things going at General Staff?

776
00:57:43,447 --> 00:57:46,166
We've just approved a declaration
supporting the Constitution

777
00:57:46,607 --> 00:57:49,201
and established a single command
under your orders, Majesty.

778
00:57:50,087 --> 00:57:51,918
Good. Good, good.

779
00:57:54,047 --> 00:57:56,197
Another thing.
ls Armada with you?

780
00:57:56,967 --> 00:57:59,197
No, l left him
in command at Buenavista.

781
00:57:59,487 --> 00:58:01,762
Leave General Staff
and return to Buenavista at once.

782
00:58:02,087 --> 00:58:04,681
-Keep me informed.
-Immediately, sir.

783
00:58:09,687 --> 00:58:11,678
Armada is alone at Buenavista.

784
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:30,238
Tejero has the Congress,
l've got my tanks on the streets.

785
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:32,358
What are you doing in Madrid?

786
00:58:32,687 --> 00:58:34,882
No one's being decisive here.

787
00:58:35,047 --> 00:58:37,117
l can't see how it can be done.

788
00:58:37,327 --> 00:58:38,760
You can't?

789
00:58:39,007 --> 00:58:40,440
lt's being done!

790
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:44,203
Get some balls
and keep your word!

791
00:59:00,927 --> 00:59:03,236
General, time's slipping by

792
00:59:03,487 --> 00:59:07,366
and the linking of chains
you talked about hasn't come about.

793
00:59:07,527 --> 00:59:10,166
l think the time has come

794
00:59:10,367 --> 00:59:12,164
to try another way.

795
00:59:13,487 --> 00:59:15,717
Let me retake the reins.

796
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:17,963
How can you,
if you haven't done anything?

797
00:59:18,127 --> 00:59:19,242
You're not even in Zarzuela

798
00:59:19,407 --> 00:59:20,806
keeping the King under wraps!

799
00:59:30,807 --> 00:59:33,401
General, l think
l speak for all of us.

800
00:59:33,807 --> 00:59:36,765
We have a unique opportunity
to put things in order.

801
00:59:37,647 --> 00:59:41,083
lt seems even the King can't stand
this government anymore.

802
00:59:41,247 --> 00:59:43,317
Have you been talking to Armada?

803
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:45,364
He gathered the officers together.

804
00:59:45,567 --> 00:59:48,877
He says that the 2nd, 4th
and 5th are thinking it over.

805
00:59:49,047 --> 00:59:51,845
lf Madrid moves out,
all Spain will follow suit.

806
00:59:53,767 --> 00:59:55,883
lt's in your hands, General.

807
00:59:56,047 --> 00:59:58,117
Go back to your posts!

808
00:59:59,647 --> 01:00:02,002
Things haven't gone
the way we thought.

809
01:00:02,327 --> 01:00:03,362
Excuses!

810
01:00:03,527 --> 01:00:05,802
Don't give me excuses again!

811
01:00:08,367 --> 01:00:10,323
You want to try it your way.

812
01:00:11,687 --> 01:00:12,563
Go ahead.

813
01:00:12,727 --> 01:00:15,161
Isn't that what you wanted
from the start?

814
01:00:21,287 --> 01:00:24,279
Alright... l'll try to....

815
01:00:26,767 --> 01:00:28,086
do something.

816
01:00:28,887 --> 01:00:32,004
Alfonso, will you tell me
what the hell's going on here?

817
01:00:35,327 --> 01:00:36,760
Milans just called.

818
01:00:36,927 --> 01:00:38,360
He tells me...

819
01:00:40,087 --> 01:00:41,884
Tejero seems very agitated.

820
01:00:42,047 --> 01:00:46,040
He's afraid there could be
a massacre at any time.

821
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:49,244
He suggested that
l go to Congress

822
01:00:49,407 --> 01:00:50,283
and...

823
01:00:52,167 --> 01:00:54,317
propose a political solution
to the deputies.

824
01:00:54,487 --> 01:00:55,681
And you refused.

825
01:00:57,567 --> 01:00:59,239
l don't know...

826
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:04,081
lf with this l did
a service to Spain...

827
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:06,795
lf l went there under your...

828
01:01:06,967 --> 01:01:07,763
direct orders...

829
01:01:16,647 --> 01:01:18,797
A decision like that
isn't up to me.

830
01:01:20,287 --> 01:01:21,925
The King would have to authorize it.

831
01:01:32,687 --> 01:01:34,200
Give the wire some slack.

832
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:37,556
-Tape in.
-Connect it.

833
01:01:45,727 --> 01:01:46,955
How are we doing?

834
01:02:00,567 --> 01:02:03,240
-Well, Chus, what do you think?
-Perfect, Majesty.

835
01:02:04,407 --> 01:02:05,806
Thank you, Nicolas.

836
01:02:06,087 --> 01:02:08,362
Do you have everything ready?

837
01:02:08,607 --> 01:02:09,722
How does it look, Pedro?

838
01:02:09,967 --> 01:02:12,720
Just the last technical adjustments
and we'll be set.

839
01:02:12,887 --> 01:02:14,036
Good.

840
01:02:14,207 --> 01:02:16,277
Sir, l've just spoken to Armada.

841
01:02:16,887 --> 01:02:18,286
He's on the phone.

842
01:02:19,567 --> 01:02:22,445
Excuse me, today's been
a day full of calls.

843
01:02:26,407 --> 01:02:27,556
Guards!

844
01:02:28,287 --> 01:02:30,039
l've just spoken to Valencia.

845
01:02:30,727 --> 01:02:32,922
The Second, Third, Fourth

846
01:02:33,087 --> 01:02:35,442
and Fifth Military Region
have said yes...

847
01:02:35,607 --> 01:02:37,598
to Milans del Bosch as President.

848
01:02:38,207 --> 01:02:40,357
The Balearics are considering it.

849
01:02:50,287 --> 01:02:52,676
This looks like a rescue operation.

850
01:02:53,167 --> 01:02:57,160
Congress has no generator.
lt could just be a power failure.

851
01:02:57,487 --> 01:03:00,365
-Please, stay put and keep calm.
-Go back to your place.

852
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:01,244
Guards!

853
01:03:02,287 --> 01:03:04,801
lf there's a blackout,
and anyone brushes past

854
01:03:04,967 --> 01:03:07,322
trying to get out or in,
open fire without hesitation.

855
01:03:07,527 --> 01:03:09,757
Cover the access points!

856
01:03:10,167 --> 01:03:11,316
Everyone stay sharp!

857
01:03:12,687 --> 01:03:14,166
What's going on, Alfonso?

858
01:03:14,407 --> 01:03:16,841
l warned you of the risk of

859
01:03:17,327 --> 01:03:20,364
some excitable person doing this.

860
01:03:20,687 --> 01:03:22,200
Now it's too late.

861
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:24,801
l need to know
what your role is in all this.

862
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:28,403
l'm just trying to intermediate.

863
01:03:28,567 --> 01:03:30,285
l've just spoken to Milans.

864
01:03:31,887 --> 01:03:33,878
He suggests that I go
to Parliament...

865
01:03:34,087 --> 01:03:37,841
and propose a crisis government.

866
01:03:38,007 --> 01:03:39,963
You want to be named president

867
01:03:40,127 --> 01:03:42,687
by a Parliament
besieged by arms, is that it?

868
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:43,996
lt's not my desire,

869
01:03:44,167 --> 01:03:47,955
but l'm ready to make that sacrifice,
if Your Majesty orders it.

870
01:03:48,127 --> 01:03:50,436
-l think you've gone mad.
-We're talking about human lives,

871
01:03:50,607 --> 01:03:52,325
not just those of politicians.

872
01:03:53,447 --> 01:03:56,519
A civil war could break out again.

873
01:03:57,847 --> 01:03:59,519
Your Majesty would be responsible...

874
01:03:59,687 --> 01:04:01,006
Responsible for what?

875
01:04:01,567 --> 01:04:05,560
You people are setting the Army
against me and all Spaniards.

876
01:04:06,767 --> 01:04:08,086
You, Alfonso.

877
01:04:08,487 --> 01:04:09,556
You,

878
01:04:10,047 --> 01:04:11,685
my tutor.

879
01:04:13,847 --> 01:04:16,566
These people are ready to open fire!

880
01:04:16,727 --> 01:04:18,479
lt'll be carnage!

881
01:04:18,647 --> 01:04:19,682
Sir,

882
01:04:21,167 --> 01:04:24,045
may l go
and speak to Tejero in your name?

883
01:04:24,207 --> 01:04:25,435
Look...

884
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:29,478
You don't have my support.

885
01:04:32,447 --> 01:04:34,517
You may not speak in my name.

886
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:41,046
ln fact, l don't want to speak to you.

887
01:04:42,407 --> 01:04:43,920
I'll put you on to Sabino.

888
01:04:53,487 --> 01:04:54,124
Alfonso,

889
01:04:54,447 --> 01:04:57,245
if you think
you can convince Tejero to surrender,

890
01:04:57,847 --> 01:04:59,200
go and see him.

891
01:04:59,607 --> 01:05:01,598
But in your own name.

892
01:05:05,207 --> 01:05:07,596
Leave the Crown out of this.

893
01:05:08,207 --> 01:05:10,596
Well, tell the King
he still has time.

894
01:05:10,767 --> 01:05:13,486
You have to convince him.
For the love of God!

895
01:05:14,447 --> 01:05:16,915
Everyone's waiting
for word from him.

896
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:18,761
And they'll get it.

897
01:05:29,407 --> 01:05:30,442
General...

898
01:05:31,887 --> 01:05:34,720
l just want to say
that l was forced to come here.

899
01:05:37,487 --> 01:05:39,762
l was in the Traffic Dept.
washing a car,

900
01:05:40,367 --> 01:05:43,325
when they gave me this gun
and told me ''Come with us''.

901
01:05:47,367 --> 01:05:49,927
We know how these things start.

902
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:52,639
But not how they end.

903
01:05:52,807 --> 01:05:55,275
We have here Gen. Prieto
of the Civil Guard,

904
01:05:55,447 --> 01:05:59,201
one of the last people to contact
his friend, Lt. Col. Tejero.

905
01:05:59,367 --> 01:06:01,198
How did he seem to you, General?

906
01:06:01,367 --> 01:06:03,642
l know him very well.

907
01:06:03,887 --> 01:06:06,037
At present he is not nervous.

908
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:08,926
He's out of his mind.

909
01:06:09,087 --> 01:06:11,442
He's making no sense at all.

910
01:06:11,607 --> 01:06:12,244
There he is!

911
01:06:12,407 --> 01:06:13,317
Excuse me.

912
01:06:13,487 --> 01:06:15,205
Attention, it seems...

913
01:06:15,367 --> 01:06:17,756
Yes, General Armada,

914
01:06:18,207 --> 01:06:21,119
along with General Aramburu
and other Army personnel

915
01:06:21,287 --> 01:06:24,120
are leaving the Palace Hotel
and heading for Congress.

916
01:06:33,487 --> 01:06:36,160
We can't make a copy here,
we have to do two takes.

917
01:06:36,327 --> 01:06:36,998
Fine.

918
01:06:37,167 --> 01:06:39,317
lt has to be filmed twice
and the tapes sent out in two cars

919
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:41,318
on separate routes
in case of roadblocks.

920
01:06:41,487 --> 01:06:42,124
Alright.

921
01:06:53,487 --> 01:06:56,001
At your orders, General,
we've been waiting for you.

922
01:06:57,807 --> 01:06:58,444
General.

923
01:07:01,527 --> 01:07:03,119
l'm sorry l'm late.

924
01:07:03,767 --> 01:07:07,123
A problem came up,
but it's all sorted out now.

925
01:07:07,287 --> 01:07:09,164
Don't worry, General,

926
01:07:09,527 --> 01:07:11,677
we've been kept very busy here.

927
01:07:14,367 --> 01:07:16,835
As Milans will have told you,
from now on

928
01:07:17,007 --> 01:07:18,963
l'm taking charge of the situation.

929
01:07:19,447 --> 01:07:21,597
l shall address the deputies.

930
01:07:23,807 --> 01:07:26,480
There's no need
for you to accompany me.

931
01:07:29,047 --> 01:07:30,685
Just a moment, General.

932
01:07:32,567 --> 01:07:35,081
We have to talk this over first.

933
01:07:36,967 --> 01:07:39,720
Tejero, we thank you
for your services,

934
01:07:39,967 --> 01:07:41,639
and we know they'll be rewarded.

935
01:07:41,847 --> 01:07:43,200
But don't make me
waste any more time.

936
01:07:43,367 --> 01:07:45,323
A government must be set up urgently.

937
01:07:46,567 --> 01:07:49,206
And what ministry would Milans
have in this government?

938
01:07:50,007 --> 01:07:52,077
That's none of your affair.

939
01:07:53,287 --> 01:07:56,836
But if you insist: none.
Milans is a soldier, not a politician.

940
01:07:57,127 --> 01:07:58,526
No, General!

941
01:07:59,767 --> 01:08:02,964
l thought we came here
to set up a Military Junta.

942
01:08:03,127 --> 01:08:04,924
Now you give me
this politician stuff.

943
01:08:06,287 --> 01:08:07,481
Let me go.

944
01:08:07,687 --> 01:08:09,245
You're making a scene.

945
01:08:23,127 --> 01:08:24,321
Come with me.

946
01:08:28,487 --> 01:08:30,398
Turn off the extractors
to cut down the noise.

947
01:08:31,167 --> 01:08:32,156
Turn them off.

948
01:08:32,327 --> 01:08:35,876
Change the clocks so they don't chime.
lt's almost half past.

949
01:08:41,887 --> 01:08:43,036
When you wish, Pedro.

950
01:08:43,887 --> 01:08:44,842
Alright, sir.

951
01:08:45,687 --> 01:08:46,881
-Are we ready?
-Ready.

952
01:08:47,087 --> 01:08:48,122
Roll it, guys.

953
01:08:49,127 --> 01:08:50,401
We're taping.

954
01:08:52,367 --> 01:08:53,641
Rolling.

955
01:08:59,567 --> 01:09:00,556
Whenever you wish.

956
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,883
On addressing the Spanish people,

957
01:09:05,327 --> 01:09:06,999
briefly and concisely,

958
01:09:07,567 --> 01:09:09,239
in the extraordinary circumstances

959
01:09:09,407 --> 01:09:11,841
we are going through at this time,

960
01:09:12,207 --> 01:09:15,199
l ask of everyone the greatest
serenity and trust.

961
01:09:21,687 --> 01:09:25,362
We must proclaim
a Military Junta at once!

962
01:09:25,687 --> 01:09:27,325
With Milans at the head.

963
01:09:27,487 --> 01:09:30,320
A cabinet to take power
and declare a state of emergency.

964
01:09:30,487 --> 01:09:31,966
That's what we have to do.

965
01:09:33,367 --> 01:09:37,042
That solution is infeasible, Tejero.

966
01:09:37,447 --> 01:09:39,358
At least for now.

967
01:09:40,007 --> 01:09:42,202
We have to find

968
01:09:43,047 --> 01:09:45,402
a solution, a compromise.

969
01:09:45,647 --> 01:09:48,480
A government
with military men, of course, but...

970
01:09:50,087 --> 01:09:52,237
inevitably, with politicians too.

971
01:09:52,847 --> 01:09:54,041
What politicians?

972
01:09:54,807 --> 01:09:58,322
Politicians from
the four main parties.

973
01:09:59,727 --> 01:10:01,957
lf l can get into the Chamber,

974
01:10:02,127 --> 01:10:04,277
l believe l can convince them.

975
01:10:06,047 --> 01:10:09,357
This is the government list
l've prepared.

976
01:10:47,127 --> 01:10:49,197
A communist in government?

977
01:10:51,927 --> 01:10:53,804
ls that why we came this far?

978
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:58,399
There's no other solution, Tejero,

979
01:10:58,607 --> 01:10:59,596
believe me.

980
01:11:00,167 --> 01:11:01,885
What does it matter?

981
01:11:02,167 --> 01:11:05,000
We give two portfolios to each party,

982
01:11:05,167 --> 01:11:06,566
so they're happy,

983
01:11:06,727 --> 01:11:10,720
but Spain will be in our hands.

984
01:11:12,607 --> 01:11:15,167
Milans would never accept this.

985
01:11:15,887 --> 01:11:18,003
Milans is in total agreement.

986
01:11:20,607 --> 01:11:22,723
Confirm it. There's the phone.

987
01:11:22,887 --> 01:11:25,845
...the Constitution,
voted for by the Spanish people,

988
01:11:26,007 --> 01:11:28,760
determined, in its day,
through a referendum.

989
01:11:31,487 --> 01:11:32,476
What do you think?

990
01:11:33,447 --> 01:11:34,926
Fine. Fine, fine.

991
01:11:35,127 --> 01:11:36,958
Now hotfoot it to Prado del Rey.

992
01:11:38,087 --> 01:11:39,520
-Sir...
-Thanks, Pedro.

993
01:11:39,687 --> 01:11:40,642
Thanks to you, sir.

994
01:11:42,207 --> 01:11:45,119
Have them escorted at all times
until it's been broadcast.

995
01:11:45,287 --> 01:11:46,720
-Yes, sir.
-Let's go.

996
01:11:49,927 --> 01:11:51,645
Listen to me, Tejero!

997
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:55,436
Nobody, nobody talked about
a Military Junta!

998
01:11:55,807 --> 01:11:58,765
Neither you nor l are politicians!

999
01:11:58,927 --> 01:12:02,397
This is about putting things
in the hands of the King and Armada,

1000
01:12:02,567 --> 01:12:04,797
-so that they decide.
-General...

1001
01:12:04,967 --> 01:12:07,117
We did our part.

1002
01:12:08,167 --> 01:12:10,886
Now obey Armada
in whatever he requests.

1003
01:12:11,047 --> 01:12:12,526
That's an order.

1004
01:12:12,927 --> 01:12:15,077
l'm sorry, General,
but l cannot obey that order.

1005
01:12:23,687 --> 01:12:24,802
ln that case...

1006
01:12:26,287 --> 01:12:27,686
prepare for the consequences.

1007
01:12:28,447 --> 01:12:30,915
Do you think at this point
l'm worried about consequences?

1008
01:12:34,087 --> 01:12:36,157
Don't kid yourself, General.

1009
01:12:37,127 --> 01:12:38,719
This man's looking for
a cushy job,

1010
01:12:38,927 --> 01:12:41,839
even at the price of
carrying on with democracy!

1011
01:12:58,047 --> 01:12:59,116
Listen...

1012
01:13:00,887 --> 01:13:03,685
Could you do me a favour
and get my coat from my seat.

1013
01:13:05,407 --> 01:13:07,602
This cold is unbearable.

1014
01:13:14,847 --> 01:13:15,916
Something's going wrong.

1015
01:13:16,367 --> 01:13:19,757
They look anxious,
like they were being abandoned.

1016
01:13:23,687 --> 01:13:25,166
That makes them more dangerous.

1017
01:13:27,887 --> 01:13:30,481
You're tired, nervous,

1018
01:13:30,647 --> 01:13:33,798
and that stops you
from taking stock of

1019
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:36,767
the situation we're in.

1020
01:13:40,247 --> 01:13:42,841
Even of your own actions.

1021
01:13:44,847 --> 01:13:47,919
lf you're worried about

1022
01:13:48,127 --> 01:13:49,685
your personal safety,

1023
01:13:50,167 --> 01:13:53,284
l have several Aviocars
ready in Getafe

1024
01:13:53,527 --> 01:13:55,483
so that you...

1025
01:13:56,007 --> 01:13:58,805
and any officers you may choose
can leave the country.

1026
01:13:59,567 --> 01:14:03,480
Later, once in government,

1027
01:14:03,727 --> 01:14:06,082
we'd process a pardon.

1028
01:14:07,247 --> 01:14:08,805
And...

1029
01:14:15,447 --> 01:14:19,360
...sure, there'd be a tidy sum
of money as a reward.

1030
01:14:21,807 --> 01:14:23,718
Thank you, General,

1031
01:14:24,407 --> 01:14:26,284
but flying makes we queasy.

1032
01:14:29,287 --> 01:14:30,879
ln the worst case scenario,

1033
01:14:31,047 --> 01:14:33,766
you'd be an exile in luxury,

1034
01:14:33,927 --> 01:14:35,519
respected and admired.

1035
01:14:35,687 --> 01:14:38,838
But if you hinder me
from addressing Congress,

1036
01:14:39,367 --> 01:14:40,959
you'll end your days in jail,

1037
01:14:41,127 --> 01:14:44,085
and forget about watching
your children grow up.

1038
01:14:48,527 --> 01:14:49,482
Look,

1039
01:14:51,167 --> 01:14:53,965
the only way out l accept
is a Military Junta.

1040
01:14:54,487 --> 01:14:58,002
lt's that, or l start
a martyr's massacre here.

1041
01:14:58,167 --> 01:14:59,566
l don't mind dying,...

1042
01:14:59,927 --> 01:15:02,316
but l'll take all of them
with me first.

1043
01:15:03,327 --> 01:15:05,841
l know you're doing this
in good faith, for Spain!

1044
01:15:06,007 --> 01:15:08,157
But l'm thinking of Spain too!

1045
01:15:08,407 --> 01:15:12,400
Or do you think
l love Spain less than you?

1046
01:15:14,247 --> 01:15:15,362
Don't make me laugh.

1047
01:15:16,807 --> 01:15:18,843
Any one of my men

1048
01:15:19,007 --> 01:15:20,884
loves Spain more than you.

1049
01:15:24,767 --> 01:15:25,756
And now,

1050
01:15:26,287 --> 01:15:27,720
if you will allow me...

1051
01:16:07,207 --> 01:16:10,995
BREAKlNG NEWS

1052
01:16:11,287 --> 01:16:12,800
The news up to this minute.

1053
01:16:12,967 --> 01:16:15,686
We can tell you that
in a few moments

1054
01:16:15,847 --> 01:16:19,237
you'll be able to hear the message
from His Majesty the King.

1055
01:16:19,407 --> 01:16:23,366
On addressing the Spanish people,
briefly and concisely,

1056
01:16:24,047 --> 01:16:26,083
in the extraordinary circumstances

1057
01:16:26,247 --> 01:16:28,841
we are going through at this time,

1058
01:16:29,007 --> 01:16:31,840
I ask of everyone the greatest
serenity and trust

1059
01:16:32,287 --> 01:16:36,280
and may they know that
I have given the generals of

1060
01:16:36,487 --> 01:16:39,638
the military regions, maritime zones

1061
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:42,799
and air sectors the following order:

1062
01:16:43,567 --> 01:16:46,604
Faced with the situation created by
developing events

1063
01:16:46,967 --> 01:16:48,605
in the Congress

1064
01:16:49,207 --> 01:16:52,005
and in order to avoid any confusion,

1065
01:16:52,207 --> 01:16:54,163
I confirm that I have ordered

1066
01:16:54,967 --> 01:16:56,639
the civil authorities

1067
01:16:56,807 --> 01:16:58,763
and the Junta of the Chiefs of StaffE

1068
01:16:59,327 --> 01:17:02,319
to take all necessary measures

1069
01:17:02,487 --> 01:17:05,047
to maintain constitutional order

1070
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:07,403
within existing legality.

1071
01:17:07,567 --> 01:17:10,764
Any measure of a military nature

1072
01:17:10,927 --> 01:17:12,599
that has to be taken

1073
01:17:13,167 --> 01:17:14,759
must have the approval

1074
01:17:14,927 --> 01:17:17,760
of the Junta of the Chiefs of StaffE.

1075
01:17:20,047 --> 01:17:23,403
The Crown cannot tolerate,
in any form,

1076
01:17:23,847 --> 01:17:27,635
actions or attitudes of people
attempting to disrupt by force

1077
01:17:27,807 --> 01:17:30,879
the democratic process
that the Constitution,

1078
01:17:31,127 --> 01:17:32,924
voted for by the Spanish people,

1079
01:17:33,087 --> 01:17:35,726
determined in its time
by referendum.

1080
01:17:42,887 --> 01:17:45,845
Mad. The man's gone mad.

1081
01:17:46,927 --> 01:17:48,724
He's threatening a massacre.

1082
01:17:50,487 --> 01:17:52,478
He's gone mad, Aramburu.

1083
01:17:54,807 --> 01:17:57,082
You can't reason with him.

1084
01:17:59,047 --> 01:18:00,400
l've failed.

1085
01:18:03,927 --> 01:18:05,758
l need to inform the King.

1086
01:18:06,447 --> 01:18:07,562
General.

1087
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:13,360
Why don't you come with me
to the Ministry of the lnterior?

1088
01:18:14,887 --> 01:18:16,923
Laina would like to speak to you.

1089
01:18:20,287 --> 01:18:21,720
Yes, of course.

1090
01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:29,524
Gen. Alfonso Armada,
Army Second-in-Command,

1091
01:18:29,727 --> 01:18:32,321
has left Congress
just a few minutes ago.

1092
01:18:32,647 --> 01:18:35,525
Gen. Armada was negotiating

1093
01:18:35,687 --> 01:18:38,804
with Lt. Col. Antonio Tejero Molina
of the Civil Guard,

1094
01:18:38,967 --> 01:18:40,605
in charge of the group

1095
01:18:40,767 --> 01:18:43,406
still holding Congress
in their power.

1096
01:18:43,767 --> 01:18:45,359
No, that won't be necessary.

1097
01:18:45,527 --> 01:18:46,960
Thank you, see you soon.

1098
01:18:47,927 --> 01:18:49,246
l just spoke to Juste.

1099
01:18:49,407 --> 01:18:50,920
Commander Pardo Zancada,
of the Brunete Division,

1100
01:18:51,087 --> 01:18:51,963
refuses to obey.

1101
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:53,879
He's mobilized a column
of military police

1102
01:18:54,127 --> 01:18:55,276
and is heading for Congress.

1103
01:18:55,447 --> 01:18:56,516
What do we know about him?

1104
01:18:56,687 --> 01:18:58,723
A zealot.
He often writes or El Alcazar.

1105
01:18:58,887 --> 01:19:02,402
The question is: could this be
the start of a chain reaction?

1106
01:19:02,567 --> 01:19:04,478
Juste can't guarantee that
there won't be more cases.

1107
01:19:04,647 --> 01:19:06,285
He says that moods are fired up.

1108
01:19:06,447 --> 01:19:08,915
-Examples like this do not help.
-What do you think?

1109
01:19:09,327 --> 01:19:12,956
After your message,
the HQs seem quieter.

1110
01:19:13,247 --> 01:19:15,363
But while Milans
refuses revoke the decree,

1111
01:19:15,527 --> 01:19:17,563
and with Tejero still holding
the government,

1112
01:19:17,767 --> 01:19:19,883
l wouldn't rule out others
like Pardos popping up.

1113
01:19:20,047 --> 01:19:21,196
Yes, Milans is the key.

1114
01:19:21,927 --> 01:19:24,805
The indecisive generals
will have their eyes on Valencia.

1115
01:19:24,967 --> 01:19:27,117
Even Tejero said
he'd only obey Milans.

1116
01:19:27,287 --> 01:19:30,438
At 1:40 in the morning,
jeeps with Army forces

1117
01:19:30,607 --> 01:19:33,883
crossed the security cordon
set up by the Police

1118
01:19:34,207 --> 01:19:37,040
and have taken up positions
facing the main gate of Congress

1119
01:19:37,207 --> 01:19:38,276
on La Carrera de San Jeronimo.

1120
01:19:38,447 --> 01:19:41,439
Thesejeeps arrived at Congress
with Military Police

1121
01:19:41,647 --> 01:19:44,161
from the Brunete Armoured Division,

1122
01:19:44,327 --> 01:19:45,476
and at 1:45,

1123
01:19:45,647 --> 01:19:48,844
they had donned helmets

1124
01:19:49,007 --> 01:19:52,124
and were awaiting orders
from Military Command

1125
01:19:52,367 --> 01:19:53,800
outside Congress itself.

1126
01:19:53,967 --> 01:19:56,640
l don't understand how you could
take these decisions

1127
01:19:56,807 --> 01:19:57,523
without consulting me!

1128
01:19:57,687 --> 01:19:59,598
No, no, Jaime,
you're not listening to me

1129
01:19:59,767 --> 01:20:01,405
and l'm sick of this drivel!

1130
01:20:01,567 --> 01:20:03,876
l order you to withdraw
those troops immediately!

1131
01:20:04,047 --> 01:20:07,164
And to tell Tejero
to stop behaving this way!

1132
01:20:07,327 --> 01:20:09,045
l swear, l'm not leaving
and l'm not abdicating!

1133
01:20:10,767 --> 01:20:12,803
You'll have to shoot me first.

1134
01:20:12,967 --> 01:20:15,083
l beg you to reconsider, Majesty.

1135
01:20:31,487 --> 01:20:32,715
Gabeiras, are you there?

1136
01:20:33,047 --> 01:20:34,639
Yes. l heard.

1137
01:20:34,807 --> 01:20:37,367
l have the Military Governor
of Valencia on the other line.

1138
01:20:37,527 --> 01:20:39,006
I'll give him the order, Majesty.

1139
01:20:42,527 --> 01:20:45,121
Send a telex to Valencia
with all the orders in writing.

1140
01:20:46,087 --> 01:20:47,236
Right away.

1141
01:20:47,887 --> 01:20:48,797
Are you alright?

1142
01:20:49,807 --> 01:20:50,603
Send that telex.

1143
01:20:50,807 --> 01:20:53,401
Caruana, direct orders from the King.

1144
01:20:53,567 --> 01:20:55,205
You have to detain Milans.

1145
01:21:01,007 --> 01:21:02,599
Your orders, Lieutenant Colonel.

1146
01:21:02,767 --> 01:21:05,201
Commander Pardos Zancada
of the Armoured Division.

1147
01:21:05,407 --> 01:21:07,477
l'm here at the request
of Milans del Bosch.

1148
01:21:07,647 --> 01:21:09,000
l have 70 men outside.

1149
01:21:12,487 --> 01:21:14,557
-70?
-70.

1150
01:21:15,367 --> 01:21:17,119
l expected a division.

1151
01:21:17,687 --> 01:21:19,678
They told me they'd send
someone higher.

1152
01:21:23,447 --> 01:21:25,039
The generals are thinking it over.

1153
01:21:26,887 --> 01:21:29,355
The Civil Guard always
takes the brunt of everything.

1154
01:21:30,487 --> 01:21:32,398
ln the end, we're left
hanging in the wind.

1155
01:21:35,327 --> 01:21:36,442
Look, Commander....

1156
01:21:36,727 --> 01:21:38,080
Do what you like.

1157
01:21:38,967 --> 01:21:42,164
The Civil Guard
can defend Spain by itself here.

1158
01:22:05,167 --> 01:22:08,557
-How did the conversation go?
-No, more of the same.

1159
01:22:08,927 --> 01:22:10,918
-Armada too.
-Yes.

1160
01:22:12,127 --> 01:22:14,402
He was going to make a botch of it.

1161
01:22:14,567 --> 01:22:16,398
A pile of shit
with politicians on top.

1162
01:22:16,887 --> 01:22:19,606
Carrillo and the Minister of whatever.

1163
01:22:19,767 --> 01:22:21,678
Just a moment, don't hang up.

1164
01:22:21,847 --> 01:22:23,041
l won't hang up.

1165
01:22:25,807 --> 01:22:27,240
This is a shitty time for me.

1166
01:22:30,567 --> 01:22:33,286
That's the way it is.
Nobody dares to step.

1167
01:22:33,447 --> 01:22:34,562
Okay, okay. Okay.

1168
01:22:39,047 --> 01:22:40,639
-Hey!
-Yes?

1169
01:22:41,247 --> 01:22:42,999
They tell me a regiment
is on its way there.

1170
01:22:44,367 --> 01:22:46,323
Villaviciosa is out, Antonio!

1171
01:22:46,487 --> 01:22:48,921
Villaviciosa and Pavia
are going to move out!

1172
01:22:49,407 --> 01:22:50,442
Hold out!

1173
01:22:50,927 --> 01:22:53,157
And tell everyone about this!

1174
01:22:53,327 --> 01:22:55,602
Hold out? Of course l'll hold out!

1175
01:22:55,767 --> 01:22:57,086
The radio is lying!

1176
01:22:57,247 --> 01:22:59,078
They've fucked us!
Of course they're lying!

1177
01:22:59,247 --> 01:23:00,646
Please, hold out!

1178
01:23:00,807 --> 01:23:02,843
-This victory is for Spain!
-Exactly.

1179
01:23:03,007 --> 01:23:03,996
For Spain!

1180
01:23:04,247 --> 01:23:07,842
This victory is for Spain!
Keep you chins up, up, up!

1181
01:23:08,607 --> 01:23:10,882
Men of honour will know
how to respond to this.

1182
01:23:11,327 --> 01:23:13,841
Juanillo, cut the propaganda!

1183
01:23:14,007 --> 01:23:16,840
Bloody hell!
Long live Spain!

1184
01:23:17,007 --> 01:23:18,042
Long live Spain!

1185
01:23:23,767 --> 01:23:24,756
Guards!

1186
01:23:24,927 --> 01:23:27,043
Pavia and Villiviciosa
are on their way here!

1187
01:23:27,287 --> 01:23:29,005
Keep your chins up!

1188
01:23:29,767 --> 01:23:31,200
Are you sure?

1189
01:23:32,047 --> 01:23:33,446
Do you trust him?

1190
01:23:33,607 --> 01:23:35,245
How could l not trust Juanillo?

1191
01:23:35,607 --> 01:23:37,086
Whose side are you on?

1192
01:23:37,247 --> 01:23:39,158
-How can you say that to me?
-And how can you say that to me?

1193
01:23:39,327 --> 01:23:41,602
-l'm just saying, think about...
-l don't think!

1194
01:23:42,327 --> 01:23:45,956
This is what we're here for,
to hold on, and die if need be!

1195
01:23:46,687 --> 01:23:49,247
lf you're not with me,
then get out.

1196
01:23:49,447 --> 01:23:50,482
Antonio...

1197
01:23:57,287 --> 01:23:58,561
General...

1198
01:23:59,047 --> 01:24:01,641
This is the hardest order
l've ever had to carry out.

1199
01:24:04,167 --> 01:24:05,885
But it comes straight from the King.

1200
01:24:07,927 --> 01:24:10,316
l'm very sorry, but l have to...

1201
01:24:19,287 --> 01:24:20,640
Take it.

1202
01:24:23,247 --> 01:24:25,442
Gunplay, you and l, General?

1203
01:24:26,287 --> 01:24:27,561
Not a chance.

1204
01:24:34,047 --> 01:24:36,845
You needn't pay heed to me,
but at least withdraw the troops.

1205
01:24:37,167 --> 01:24:39,727
And leave those brave men
in the lurch?

1206
01:24:41,327 --> 01:24:42,680
lt's a superior order.

1207
01:24:43,327 --> 01:24:46,000
l gave my word of honour
to those men!

1208
01:24:53,047 --> 01:24:54,321
Caruana...

1209
01:24:56,687 --> 01:24:59,406
How can we give Spain back
its dignity

1210
01:24:59,567 --> 01:25:02,764
if we can't behave with honour
amongst ourselves?

1211
01:25:04,847 --> 01:25:08,203
l was taught that
discipline comes before honour.

1212
01:25:10,927 --> 01:25:14,556
When what you hold most sacred
is destroyed all around you...

1213
01:25:15,327 --> 01:25:17,397
there are times when
you cannot obey,

1214
01:25:17,567 --> 01:25:18,841
you have to act.

1215
01:25:19,007 --> 01:25:21,282
At least you'll have
the consolation of having tried.

1216
01:25:34,447 --> 01:25:37,245
-Take me to Lt. Col. Tejero.
-That's impossible right now.

1217
01:25:37,407 --> 01:25:39,602
-Here he is.
-Antonito!

1218
01:25:40,927 --> 01:25:41,916
Camilo...

1219
01:25:42,727 --> 01:25:45,161
-What a surprise.
-Your Guards won't let me past.

1220
01:25:47,207 --> 01:25:49,004
What are you doing here?

1221
01:25:49,167 --> 01:25:52,796
l was nearby
and l'm just visiting.

1222
01:25:54,607 --> 01:25:56,165
But if l'm a nuisance...

1223
01:25:57,047 --> 01:26:00,323
How could you be a nuisance?
Give me a hug.

1224
01:26:02,327 --> 01:26:03,442
Thanks.

1225
01:26:03,927 --> 01:26:06,202
Come on in.
Ever been here before?

1226
01:26:06,367 --> 01:26:08,005
-No.
-l'll show you around.

1227
01:26:08,167 --> 01:26:11,955
These stairs go up to the podium.

1228
01:26:12,207 --> 01:26:13,037
Come.

1229
01:26:13,207 --> 01:26:14,959
This hall leads to
some fabulous rooms.

1230
01:26:15,127 --> 01:26:17,641
l keep the dangerous ones
separate here.

1231
01:26:17,927 --> 01:26:19,076
Guards!

1232
01:26:19,407 --> 01:26:21,125
Pavia and Villaviciosa
are on their way here!

1233
01:26:21,487 --> 01:26:24,285
General, a telex
just in from Valencia.

1234
01:26:32,567 --> 01:26:34,239
Milans has revoked the decree.

1235
01:26:34,527 --> 01:26:36,279
That means his surrender.

1236
01:26:36,447 --> 01:26:38,836
We hope now that nobody moves out.

1237
01:26:41,367 --> 01:26:42,402
What about Tejero?

1238
01:26:43,087 --> 01:26:45,442
The bastards have cut off everything.

1239
01:26:46,807 --> 01:26:49,275
l have to find out where
Pavia and Villaviciosa are!

1240
01:26:50,367 --> 01:26:53,996
Holy shit, we have to find
a fucking phone that works!

1241
01:26:54,167 --> 01:26:55,725
Holy fucking shit!

1242
01:27:06,887 --> 01:27:07,956
In short,

1243
01:27:08,407 --> 01:27:11,205
we want the unity of Spain, peace,

1244
01:27:11,367 --> 01:27:13,119
order and security.

1245
01:27:13,287 --> 01:27:15,005
And sign it with
a ''Long live Spain''.

1246
01:27:20,007 --> 01:27:21,520
You've moved me, Antonio.

1247
01:27:22,487 --> 01:27:23,397
l've taken it down.

1248
01:27:23,567 --> 01:27:25,956
lt'll be in the morning edition
of El Alcazar tomorrow.

1249
01:27:26,407 --> 01:27:28,967
People will hit the streets
in droves when they read this.

1250
01:27:29,807 --> 01:27:31,923
Don't give in, Antonio!

1251
01:27:32,087 --> 01:27:34,555
-This is for Spain!
-Of course it is, damn it!

1252
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:37,078
-Long live Spain!
-Long live Spain.

1253
01:27:37,247 --> 01:27:38,396
And another thing, Juanillo.

1254
01:27:38,567 --> 01:27:40,080
l may not be able to call you again.

1255
01:27:40,247 --> 01:27:42,317
l've got Carmen on the other line.

1256
01:27:42,887 --> 01:27:44,240
-Carmen?
-Don't hang up.

1257
01:27:44,687 --> 01:27:46,086
Speak up so she can hear you.

1258
01:27:50,127 --> 01:27:51,355
How are you, honey?

1259
01:27:52,247 --> 01:27:53,441
Fine, baby, fine.

1260
01:27:53,607 --> 01:27:55,677
Antonio, promise me
there'll be no bloodshed.

1261
01:27:55,847 --> 01:27:58,725
Of course there won't be
any bloodshed. Don't worry!

1262
01:27:58,887 --> 01:28:00,559
Why didn't you tell me anything?

1263
01:28:01,407 --> 01:28:02,806
How little you love me.

1264
01:28:03,367 --> 01:28:04,959
Of course l love you, sweetie.

1265
01:28:07,487 --> 01:28:09,364
-Juan Garcia Carres?
-Yes, what is it?

1266
01:28:09,567 --> 01:28:11,125
You're under arrest.

1267
01:28:11,287 --> 01:28:12,276
-Carmen?
-Antonio?

1268
01:28:12,567 --> 01:28:14,603
Stop! Stop!

1269
01:28:15,887 --> 01:28:19,323
The well-known ultra-right leader
Juan Garcia Carres

1270
01:28:19,487 --> 01:28:21,876
was arrested this morning
at his home in Madrid.

1271
01:28:28,127 --> 01:28:29,719
National Radio Network.

1272
01:28:29,887 --> 01:28:31,320
9 minutes to 7 in the morning.

1273
01:28:31,487 --> 01:28:33,762
We hand you over to
another of our mobile units,

1274
01:28:33,927 --> 01:28:37,078
located in front of
the Congress of Deputies.

1275
01:28:37,247 --> 01:28:38,123
Luis de Benito...

1276
01:28:38,527 --> 01:28:40,722
As we previously reported,

1277
01:28:40,887 --> 01:28:43,276
Civil Guard forces have vacated

1278
01:28:43,447 --> 01:28:46,484
the Congress Building,
and have been replaced by

1279
01:28:46,647 --> 01:28:48,126
members of the National Police...

1280
01:29:09,727 --> 01:29:13,561
-Hello? Listen, l need...
-Are you Tejero?

1281
01:29:13,927 --> 01:29:16,646
Yes. Put me through to Milans.
lt's very important.

1282
01:29:17,567 --> 01:29:19,398
The General has retired
to his rooms.

1283
01:29:19,647 --> 01:29:20,284
What?

1284
01:29:21,847 --> 01:29:23,599
He's asked you to hand yourself in,

1285
01:29:23,767 --> 01:29:26,156
to negotiate surrender.

1286
01:29:36,047 --> 01:29:37,162
Guards!

1287
01:29:38,327 --> 01:29:39,362
Attention!

1288
01:29:45,167 --> 01:29:48,045
From the King on down,
they're all trash!

1289
01:29:48,887 --> 01:29:49,842
Trash.

1290
01:29:54,807 --> 01:29:55,876
What did they say?

1291
01:29:59,567 --> 01:30:00,761
He's asleep.

1292
01:30:02,487 --> 01:30:03,886
He's gone to sleep.

1293
01:30:10,287 --> 01:30:11,925
A nation of cowards.

1294
01:30:13,247 --> 01:30:15,636
They don't deserve our sacrifice.

1295
01:30:24,047 --> 01:30:27,119
COUP FAlLS

1296
01:30:29,047 --> 01:30:31,959
All that effort to change
Spain's image...

1297
01:30:34,287 --> 01:30:37,597
...and in the end, this is the photo
that'll go around the world.

1298
01:30:37,767 --> 01:30:38,882
Guards...

1299
01:30:39,807 --> 01:30:41,035
the time has come

1300
01:30:42,327 --> 01:30:44,158
to show that

1301
01:30:44,327 --> 01:30:46,443
in the holy name of Spain,

1302
01:30:46,607 --> 01:30:49,201
we shall sacrifice everything.

1303
01:30:53,407 --> 01:30:56,160
Yes, it's been a rough night.

1304
01:30:58,807 --> 01:31:01,605
We're tired.

1305
01:31:02,807 --> 01:31:05,446
lt's time for us to show ourselves
to be even more united!

1306
01:31:06,647 --> 01:31:08,638
We're going to turn this Congress...

1307
01:31:10,767 --> 01:31:12,200
into a new Alcazar...

1308
01:31:14,287 --> 01:31:16,596
a new Santa Maria de la Cabeza!

1309
01:31:17,327 --> 01:31:19,602
And like the men of
glorious Captain Cortes,

1310
01:31:20,567 --> 01:31:21,841
we will resist...

1311
01:31:22,007 --> 01:31:24,043
until ultimate victory is ours.

1312
01:31:25,487 --> 01:31:27,045
Who is ready to follow me?

1313
01:31:49,407 --> 01:31:50,681
Stand to attention.

1314
01:31:55,167 --> 01:31:56,156
Stand to attention.

1315
01:32:16,727 --> 01:32:17,682
Here he is.

1316
01:32:24,087 --> 01:32:26,965
Lt. Col. Eduardo Fuentes,
sent by the General Staff.

1317
01:32:27,527 --> 01:32:29,677
Fine. What do you want?

1318
01:32:31,047 --> 01:32:33,720
These are the conditions proposed
by Commander Pardo Zancada.

1319
01:32:36,887 --> 01:32:38,764
None of your men,
from lieutenant down,

1320
01:32:38,927 --> 01:32:40,280
will suffer any reprisals.

1321
01:32:40,487 --> 01:32:43,206
You will all leave for El Pardo,
and there, in your barracks,

1322
01:32:43,367 --> 01:32:45,517
without photographers,
you will surrender.

1323
01:32:45,687 --> 01:32:48,406
And l'll be the last
to leave the Congress Building.

1324
01:32:50,687 --> 01:32:51,676
Very well.

1325
01:32:55,127 --> 01:32:59,120
We can offer a pact of honour
on similar terms for the Civil Guard.

1326
01:33:03,367 --> 01:33:04,277
Look...

1327
01:33:05,927 --> 01:33:07,599
...for the good of my men...

1328
01:33:08,687 --> 01:33:10,723
l'd accept these conditions...

1329
01:33:13,327 --> 01:33:16,285
but l will, of course,
be the last to leave.

1330
01:33:16,447 --> 01:33:18,836
Over 20 Civil Guards

1331
01:33:19,007 --> 01:33:21,760
have abandoned
the Congress Building.

1332
01:33:22,007 --> 01:33:24,726
The Guards jumped from
a first floor window

1333
01:33:24,887 --> 01:33:27,401
of the Press OffEice section.

1334
01:33:29,127 --> 01:33:31,322
Tell Captain Munecas
l'm on my way.

1335
01:33:32,847 --> 01:33:34,599
lt's what must be done, Antonio.

1336
01:33:35,847 --> 01:33:38,122
It appears

1337
01:33:38,287 --> 01:33:40,847
to be Colonel Tejero

1338
01:33:41,007 --> 01:33:44,443
in Civil Guard uniform,
talking to another offEicer.

1339
01:33:44,687 --> 01:33:46,757
It seems they've seen the camera,

1340
01:33:48,607 --> 01:33:51,644
but aren't taking much notice of it.

1341
01:34:42,167 --> 01:34:43,441
Adolfo...

1342
01:34:46,447 --> 01:34:47,880
President...

1343
01:34:53,767 --> 01:34:57,760
With every passing minute
it's getting harder and harder

1344
01:34:57,927 --> 01:34:59,565
