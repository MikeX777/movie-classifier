00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,714
Nimbus Film presents

3
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,596
A Nimbus Film/Wuste Filmproduktion

4
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,274
Wuste Film Ost/Studio Babelsberg
production

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,792
Based on actual events

6
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,754
Do you remember
when they arrived?

7
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,150
Do you remember
April 9th?

8
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,998
I think you do.
Everybody does.

9
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,038
All of a sudden
they were everywhere.

10
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,312
The Gestapo,
The Wehrmacht, Abwehr, SS.

11
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,636
All the German corps.

12
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,636
German Nazis.

13
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,234
Danish Nazis.

14
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,750
They came out of the dark.

15
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,077
They had been
awaiting the day.

16
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,918
Did you go outside and watch?

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,151
What were you thinking?

18
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:05,557
Flame & Lemon

19
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,916
A film by
Ole Christian Madsen

20
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,875
North of Copenhagen, May 1 944

21
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,390
Act with determination.

22
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,196
Execute your plan.

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,958
If you stay calm,
no one will suspect a thing.

24
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,151
People will only be looking
at the dead.

25
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,236
At nothing else.

26
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,233
They won't see you leaving.

27
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,995
They won 't remember you...

28
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,318
...at all.

29
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,553
I know I'm doing the right thing.

30
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,715
It's the only right thing.

31
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,791
You see?

32
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,991
Yes...

33
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,990
Lieutenant Ostergaard Petersen

34
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,239
Yes?

35
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,114
Flowers from
Dagmarhus headquarters.

36
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,435
- Ostergard Petersen?
- That's correct.

37
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,393
Shall I sign for them?

38
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,988
No.

39
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,799
You often asked me why.

40
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,273
Why we do this.

41
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,839
Why?

42
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,799
- Don't provoke them.
- Sure.

43
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,590
One good reason:

44
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,629
The Schalburg Corps.

45
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,228
Good morning.

46
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,476
Papers.

47
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,672
No, I don't think so...
Have you seen any papers?

48
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:37,276
Danes in German uniforms.
Traitors.

49
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,557
Some are experienced soldiers
from the Eastern Front.

50
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,591
Brutal bastards.

51
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,553
Impossible to get close to.

52
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,636
Always in groups.

53
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,999
They are... vermin.

54
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,553
Go!.

55
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,954
The ambulance people help us.

56
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,268
The police help us.

57
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,156
Everyone who 's not afraid
helps us.

58
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,196
Editor Gaust

59
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,672
They've raised the reward.
1 0,000.

60
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,156
- For the both of us?
- Just you.

61
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,312
- What do they know?
- They know you're a redhead.

62
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,394
Get your hair dyed, Bent.

63
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,313
Or wear a hat.

64
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,591
- A hat?
- Or a cap, if you prefer.

65
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,033
That's him.

66
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,837
Another good reason:

67
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,919
Nazi editors who spew their
propaganda through newspapers.

68
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,992
Editor Gaust?

69
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,399
Each has his own reasons.

70
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,550
On the 9th of April Jorgen watches
as the Germans march into the city.

71
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,438
Endless rows of soldiers
make his stomach turn.

72
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,915
He feels sick.

73
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,994
A feeling that persists.

74
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,669
Right up until that day last summer,
when he enters a radio store.

75
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,235
In the back room they were printing
illegal flyers,

76
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,549
and at long last Jorgen meets
like-minded people.

77
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,990
And before long they're involved
in underground activities.

78
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,435
Now Jorgen and a few others
are the only ones left.

79
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:23,389
Everybody else either fled,
got beaten to a pulp in jail or died.

80
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,274
Shot at the pole.

81
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,838
But Jorgen...
Jorgen persisted.

82
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,998
Smuggling British pilots at night.
Getting explosives to the saboteurs.

83
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,072
He 's eating pills
to stay awake.

84
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,152
Procuring weapons.
Everything.

85
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,309
And he rides with me.

86
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,195
Time?

87
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,835
1 1.25 p. m.
Shot through the back of the head.

88
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,152
Aksel Winther is a police solicitor.

89
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,438
He has access to all the confidential
channels at police HQ.

90
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:52,869
He is in contact with the British and
gets his orders directly from them.

91
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,709
Last autumn he helped the Jews
flee the country.

92
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,479
Without him there was nothing.

93
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,591
Our chain of command
is quite clear.

94
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:07,078
- I didn't authorise killing Gaust.
- We assessed that it was safe.

95
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,234
- And we were in the neighbourhood.
- Really?

96
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,838
A signature
for the big shots in Stockholm.

97
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,877
- Some things are on the way.
- What things?

98
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,679
Things that require discretion,

99
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,958
and the utmost discipline.

100
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,355
- You'll like it.
- With Winther...

101
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,119
- It's big.
-...it's always big.

102
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,595
Mother country.

103
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,114
Who else would celebrate three killings
in a place swarming with Germans.

104
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,949
That requires code.

105
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,028
There aren't many of us,
and it's hard to tell who does what.

106
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,517
Once in a while we get together,
but we usually work alone.

107
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,910
That's Bob, a veteran
from the Winter War in Finland.

108
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,199
The schoolteacher called Brains,
expert at getting information.

109
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,599
Big Bear, expert with the ladies.
Always ready to party.

110
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,194
And Little Bear,
great with weapons.

111
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,348
Rumour has it that if they shoot
the man, they also shoot his wife.

112
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:37,950
The wine merchant sells information
to both us and the Germans.

113
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,071
The Banana, former boxer who
takes part in every operation he can.

114
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,236
Carl, a timid fellow,
but tough if need be.

115
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,434
Heinrich and Teddy, students,
the youngest of us.

116
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:58,471
Slim, he talks and talks
and never stops. Always about food.

117
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,754
Cap, previously a nun in Belgium.
Has her own group in Kastrup.

118
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,434
The Banana considers it his job
to protect her.

119
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,755
And Jorgen, my friend.

120
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,154
We've been through this.
Stay clear of him.

121
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:44,112
Karl Heinz Hoffmann.
Head of the Gestapo.

122
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,719
He's the one hounding us.

123
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,518
Hoffmann wants to see you.

124
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,558
Make no mistake.

125
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,834
He's the biggest mass murderer
Denmark has ever seen.

126
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,188
But you already know that.

127
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,672
May I offer you a drink?

128
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,354
Pardon my manners.
Svend Christensen, police detective.

129
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,033
- And your name?
- Ketty Selmer.

130
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,000
- Cheers, Svend Christensen.
- Cheers.

131
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,992
Very nice.

132
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,673
You're married?

133
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,556
Yes.

134
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,748
- I haven't seen you here before.
- I don't come here often. I travel.

135
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,990
- What do you do?
- Fashion design and photography.

136
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,033
I just did a shoot
for Women of the Times.

137
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,348
- Who are you?
- Thank you for the wine.

138
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,156
I asked you a question.

139
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,398
You ask too many questions.
Goodbye, Bent.

140
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,475
"Goodbye, Bent."

141
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,276
Maybe one of the boys said too much.

142
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,198
They would never say my name.

143
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,036
There she is!

144
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,038
Bent, it's a Kraut hotel.
It's crawling with them.

145
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,278
- I'm going in.
- Okay.

146
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,672
If you're not back in half an hour,
I'm going in after you.

147
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,749
Yes.

148
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,319
ClD.
Ketty Selmer?

149
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,678
Nordland Hotel, Vesterbrogade,
Copenhagen

150
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,996
What do you want?

151
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,989
May I come in?

152
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,155
Who do you know?

153
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,872
I design and photograph fashion.

154
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,359
Look.

155
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,910
- Why did you call me Bent?
- It's your name, isn't it?

156
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,996
What do you really do?

157
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,878
- I can't tell you.
- You'll have to.

158
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,233
I'm a courier.
Stockholm-Copenhagen.

159
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,278
I carry letters.
I know the wine merchant.

160
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,631
The wine merchant?
He merely passes on information.

161
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,548
He's just a go-between.
You don't work for a go-between.

162
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,638
I also know Winther.

163
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,756
What do you do for Winther?

164
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,959
You know I can't tell you.

165
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,032
- And that's not why you're here.
- It isn't?

166
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,558
You had something else
in mind.

167
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,556
I don't sleep with married women.

168
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,989
My husband is gay.

169
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,554
My marriage is pure pro forma. He's
Swedish, so I can go back and forth.

170
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,355
Are you attracted to me?

171
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,599
Yes.

172
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,718
Why?

173
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,110
Because you're beautiful.

174
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,718
How old are you?

175
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,633
I'm 23.
Why?

176
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,950
You're young.

177
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,713
Age matters.

178
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,950
Now, leave.

179
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,553
- Ketty Selmer, is that your real name?
- Yes, of course. Why not?

180
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,597
Now, go.

181
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,393
This is my landlady, Lis.

182
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,669
And her husband, Helmer.

183
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,831
This is where I live.

184
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,272
In their basement.

185
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,156
It's a good place.

186
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,912
A good place to wait in.
That's how it is.

187
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,918
Most of my time is spent waiting.

188
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:30,030
This is Horst Ernst Gilbert, colonel
and editor at Scandinavian Telegrams,

189
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,554
where he spews
German propaganda.

190
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,760
Political refugee. In reality he's
a highly placed spy in the Abwehr.

191
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,355
Closest collaborator is
Hermann Seibold.

192
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,319
SS-Obersturmbannfuhrer.
Head of agents in Scandinavia.

193
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,789
And lastly,
Mrs Elisabeth Lorentzen.

194
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:53,637
An author. Highly placed in
the Abwehr and a secretary to Gilbert.

195
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,037
Care for some pastry?

196
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,155
And it's real coffee.

197
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,152
- They're Germans?
- German spies!

198
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,754
Yes, but Germans nonetheless.

199
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,279
But the Liberation Council issued
a ban on liquidation of Germans?

200
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,592
It's more of a recommendation.
One that we do not follow.

201
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,914
It's a British order. London wants
Abwehr extinguished in Scandinavia.

202
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,838
Did I get it all wrong?

203
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,834
Isn't our job to eliminate
Danish informers and Nazis?

204
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:32,596
Yes, but you're in Special Forces,
and you'll do as you are told!

205
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,439
Fine.

206
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,790
- How about you, Bent?
- Perfect.

207
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,029
- But I don't shoot women.
- You don't?

208
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,193
Then you'll do it, Citron.

209
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,070
Or do you also have
a problem with women?

210
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,155
No, I don't.

211
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,636
So, we're shooting
high-ranking German officers.

212
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,197
Then let's get Hoffmann.
We would paralyse the Gestapo.

213
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,995
- There are no orders to that effect.
- You can give it.

214
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,156
No, I can't.
And I won't!

215
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,909
Stay away from Hoffmann,
the both of you!

216
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,317
Bent, don't get caught up
in a conversation with Gilbert.

217
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:33,910
He has a powerful personality
and a great... spiritual potential.

218
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,476
- Knock on the door and shoot him!
- Yes.

219
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,831
Good evening, Nielsen.

220
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,071
I met a woman last night.
Ketty Selmer.

221
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,270
Did you, now?

222
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,914
Stay away from her.

223
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,036
- Waiting for me?
- Yes.

224
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,951
What do you want?

225
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,077
I need to know
how you know my name.

226
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:32,039
- Someone must have let it slip.
- Yes, the question is who.

227
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,957
Don't worry.
We're on the same side.

228
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,598
We are?

229
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,151
Is it Winther?

230
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:49,117
Don't ask me about that
or anything else.

231
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,671
Don't come here again.
It's the last thing I need.

232
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,950
Good night.

233
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,996
I was to shoot this woman.
The one who turned in Finn.

234
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,271
I ran up the stairs.

235
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,991
Knocked on the door.
She opened it.

236
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,715
I was about to pull the trigger...

237
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,359
But somehow she managed to tell me
that she wasn't an informer.

238
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,717
She only informed on him
because he'd abandoned her.

239
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:23,391
He had promised to marry her,
but he was already married.

240
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,314
She was just a lonely hurt woman.

241
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,114
She stood there
staring right at me.

242
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,395
And I couldn't pull the trigger.

243
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,595
She cried and cried...

244
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,070
I just couldn't.

245
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,839
I wet my pants and ran off.

246
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,750
The following week
she turned in two more.

247
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,389
I swore it would never happen again.

248
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,399
Why couldn't you do it?

249
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,352
I forgot that we're not killing people,
but Nazis.

250
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,509
This one is all yours, Jorgen.

251
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,432
We have to get going.

252
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,548
If you're not back in five minutes,
I'm going in.

253
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,158
Ready?

254
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,309
Editor
Horst Ernst Gilbert

255
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,756
I couldn't do it!

256
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,750
I only got her in the shoulder.

257
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:03,635
I've never killed before, Bent.
I'm sorry.

258
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,756
- Who are you?
- This is from Police Solicitor Winther.

259
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,953
Legal documents.

260
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,872
- May I see your badge?
- Yes, of course.

261
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:58,312
One must be cautious these days.
My husband is resting.

262
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,429
Would you like some tea?

263
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,519
"Thank you, Budjonny."

264
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,999
The famous Soviet general.
I educated him myself, Mr...?

265
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,838
Christensen.
Svend Christensen.

266
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:52,552
After the First World War many officers
tried their luck in the Red Army.

267
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,195
Germany was
destroyed and impoverished.

268
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,958
The Russian officers,
who now fight the German army,

269
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,319
were trained by us.

270
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,989
But I suppose you knew that.

271
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,596
You're here on behalf of
my friend Winther?

272
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,639
Yes, I was to deliver
these documents to you.

273
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,792
Thank you.
Is something wrong with your hand?

274
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,160
Your German is very good,
Mr Christensen.

275
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:32,034
Thank you.
I used to live in Germany.

276
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,918
My father sent me there.

277
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,555
You're in the resistance.

278
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,790
Well, you're here on behalf of Winther.
Don't be alarmed.

279
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,077
I have no sympathy for Hitler
or the National Socialists.

280
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:03,110
- You swore allegiance to Der Fuhrer.
- That is a matter for my conscience.

281
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,919
You are a partisan.

282
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,716
That's very interesting.

283
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,197
A soldier without a front.

284
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,670
Are you a good soldier?

285
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,599
Are you prepared to pay the price?

286
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,516
- What price?
- What do you think?

287
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,557
Your life.

288
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:43,995
You see, there can be only
three reasons for fighting in a war.

289
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,991
Firstly, career opportunity.

290
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:50,318
It's widespread but does not
produce good soldiers.

291
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:55,434
You have a fear of dying
and only think of peace.

292
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:59,752
Secondly, ideology.
Love of the mother country.

293
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,197
That is much more intriguing,
but the dreamer breaks down.

294
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:08,796
He doesn't have the strength.
He's shallow.

295
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,469
The frivolous and presumptuous nature
of youth.

296
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,991
Unless he's passionate.
Fanatical, if you will.

297
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:23,430
That makes
for a good soldier.

298
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:29,078
- And thirdly?
- Hatred of your enemy.

299
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,749
Hate seduces you
into doing things...

300
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,954
you never thought
yourself capable of.

301
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,436
Unless the hatred is caused by
a personal neurosis.

302
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,198
What are you saying?

303
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:47,393
The neurotic is intelligent
and he has doubts.

304
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:53,309
If he is betrayed,
his hatred fades,

305
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,437
and doubt sets in.

306
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,998
War does nothing
for the neurotic.

307
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:07,031
The gentle loving father
is not to be found in war.

308
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,673
Your cause, Christensen,
is legitimate.

309
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,315
Now you must become
a good soldier.

310
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,190
Leaving already?

311
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,914
I suppose it had to come to this.

312
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,719
You're making a big mistake.

313
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:40,195
Our Father, who art in heaven...

314
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,913
Hallowed be thy Name...

315
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,788
Something's not right.

316
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:09,197
- What happened?
- Drive!

317
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,030
Hermann Seibold

318
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,791
Stop it.

319
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,354
Easy, now. Breathe.

320
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:59,549
Bent, you'll be taken
to a private clinic.

321
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,837
When you get an order,
you follow it!

322
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,229
Do you understand?
It's not optional!

323
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:10,758
- Yes, but Seibold was tough.
- Of course, he's a trained soldier!

324
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,998
Mrs Lorentzen is dead,
and Seibold is wounded.

325
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,510
One out of three
isn't good enough.

326
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,519
Then do it yourself next time.

327
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,473
I'll choose to ignore that.

328
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,796
I was quite clear about Gilbert.

329
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,596
- He's not a Nazi. He admires us.
- You think so?

330
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,029
He'd say anything
to get off the hook.

331
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,839
Gilbert is insanely intelligent.

332
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:47,113
He knew you were coming.

333
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,752
He played you.
He's been laughing at you all day.

334
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,115
He called up Hoffmann
and they had a laugh!

335
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,913
It won't happen again.

336
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:01,830
I'm sorry. I'm sorry...

337
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,033
Just make sure
you survive.

338
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:12,071
I'm meeting Hoffmann in half an hour.
Bent left the documents at Gilbert's.

339
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,549
Hoffmann wants an explanation.

340
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,757
Jorgen...
There's someone to see you.

341
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,597
- Where's Anne?
- Right outside.

342
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:05,311
We've been looking for you.
You said you'd pick us up.

343
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,670
This is from you.
It's the book she wanted.

344
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,475
- But it's on Monday.
- It's today.

345
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:24,148
Shall we celebrate?
We usually do.

346
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,959
We can't afford to celebrate.

347
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,759
You bring home nothing,

348
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,429
and my father won't help out,
as long as I'm married to you.

349
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,558
Wait.

350
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,634
Lend me some money.
Come on.

351
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,796
Cough up.

352
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,316
It's my daughter's birthday.
Cough up.

353
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:01,152
There's that Nazi grocer.
He's loaded with cash.

354
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,674
I'm not a criminal.

355
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,719
Stay away from him.
Little Bear, you too.

356
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,231
Go out and play
with your new yoyo.

357
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,830
I'm sorry.

358
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,475
She's learned how to whistle?

359
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,750
A lot has happened.

360
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,317
I don't know
if I can take this anymore.

361
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,397
Do you understand?

362
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,830
- Bodil, I...
- I'm not going to Sweden!

363
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,194
You have to.

364
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,033
- It's safer.
- We're safe here.

365
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,635
I can't visit you here.
In Sweden I can.

366
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,909
I love you.

367
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,600
It's the war.

368
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:37,830
This has nothing to do with the war.
You weren't home before either.

369
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,269
I sat waiting then, too.

370
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,278
It has nothing to do with that.

371
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,074
You're not cut out for it, that's all.

372
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,075
You're just not that kind of man.

373
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,959
Stockholm, 3 weeks later

374
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,478
- Are they coming?
- I assume so.

375
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:32,270
- They're your men, you should know.
- I should, but I don't.

376
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,116
Finally.

377
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,959
Spex from
Danish Army intelligence.

378
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:58,277
- Flame, Citron.
- Welcome to Stockholm.

379
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,952
Thanks.

380
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,477
Welcome.

381
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:07,998
Three days ago the Gestapo retaliated
for the attacks on German officers.

382
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:13,430
Stopped a streetcar and threw eight
hand-grenades at the 29 passengers.

383
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:19,476
You can imagine the consequences.
If not, then look at the file.

384
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:25,557
The Gestapo threatens to repeat it,
if the attacks persist.

385
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,596
Pure terror.

386
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:32,629
Terror that could've been avoided, if
you hadn't started attacking Germans.

387
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,790
I don't know what you mean.

388
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:38,993
Maybe you can make Hoffmann
believe that your hands are clean,

389
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:42,914
but we know that you ordered
the assassinations of Gilbert,

390
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,996
Mrs Lorentzen
and Seibold.

391
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,355
I still don't know
what you're talking about.

392
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,076
I act on direct orders
from the British Command.

393
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:57,550
- And I don't answer to anyone else.
- What the hell are you talking about?

394
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:01,189
- Are you kidding me?
- What's this about?

395
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:13,390
This is an order: There will be no
retaliation for the streetcar incident.

396
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:17,268
All killings, all sabotage
will cease immediately.

397
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,633
The Communist groups
have received identical orders.

398
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:26,553
We need 50,000 armed men
ready to ambush the Germans,

399
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,918
on the day the Allied Forces land
on the west coast. This is big.

400
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:36,033
We need peace to establish
these covert groups.

401
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:41,430
And I need to listen to the 29 victims.
They say only one thing:

402
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,028
Revenge.

403
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,430
From your time in the army,
Mr Faurschou-Hviid...

404
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,835
Leave us!

405
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:58,598
You must know the consequences
of wartime disobedience.

406
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,911
- Is that a threat?
- Read it as you wish.

407
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:06,436
We're preparing a big military
operation and neither we

408
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:11,588
nor the British want it disrupted
by random civilian resistance.

409
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,200
Our goal is to win the peace,
not escalate the war.

410
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,429
I follow standing orders.

411
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:22,354
- Such as executing Gilbert?
- Among others.

412
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,955
I'll personally call London
and find out who you work for.

413
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:30,198
Until then you follow my orders.
Is that clear?

414
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,037
- The mother country.
- The mother country.

415
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,158
- Yes?
- It's Winther.

416
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:58,398
Spex is clueless. He thinks he can
run everything from Stockholm.

417
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,313
Are they following us?

418
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,119
- Yes.
- Spex' people?

419
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:12,030
Spex is a moron. It's the Swedish
Intelligence, SAPO. They're worried.

420
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,072
- About what?
- That you'll shoot someone here.

421
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,192
They don't want trouble
with their German friends.

422
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,833
You're quite famous here.

423
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,870
- Thank you.
- It'll be hard to get close to Gilbert.

424
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:35,509
The Gestapo has him covered.
He has two guards at all times.

425
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:39,633
I'll be ready in two weeks.
To do whatever you decide.

426
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,832
- London wants action now.
- Now?

427
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:49,069
Gilbert is expanding.
He's turning into a serious threat.

428
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:52,550
- Can the Bears do it?
- They're too noisy.

429
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:56,389
This requires precision,
discretion and a minimum of brains.

430
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:01,399
Maybe I can shoot him from the car.

431
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,159
If we can get close enough.

432
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:09,399
- Too risky.
- Let me. I'll do it.

433
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,391
Don't, Jorgen.

434
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:55,394
Let's drink to Jorgen.
Cheers!

435
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,791
We're closed.

436
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,513
We're closed.

437
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,550
Alright, what can I do for you?

438
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:35,397
Do you want to live?
You Nazi pig.

439
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,720
Fill it up.

440
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:02,237
Eggs, flour, yeast, sugar...

441
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,510
Whatever you have.

442
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:12,153
I see you have real coffee
for your friends in the party.

443
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,874
Nice apples...

444
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:22,318
- Is this real chocolate?
- Yes.

445
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,033
What the hell is that?

446
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:48,913
What the hell do you take me for?
Someone who steals your money?

447
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,916
Do you think I'm a thief?

448
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,995
- Are you calling me a thief?
- I'm sorry...

449
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,234
Thank you...

450
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,879
- Hello, Jorgen.
- Hello.

451
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,118
- You're home late.
- Yes.

452
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,398
Hey, sweetie.

453
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,153
Look, what Dad bought for you.

454
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,238
- Isn't it pretty?
- Thank you.

455
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,993
And a few dresses...

456
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:54,196
And this is for you.
It should last you for a few days.

457
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:55,875
Thank you.

458
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:02,872
Anne, go put on your pyjamas.

459
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,468
I'll be right there to tuck you in.

460
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:23,797
Jorgen,
I have to tell you something.

461
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,468
I met someone.

462
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,393
Are you listening to me?

463
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:44,317
It shouldn't have happened.
But it did.

464
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,394
I'm so sorry.

465
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,988
Jorgen.

466
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,514
Please don't...

467
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,871
- Who is it?
- That's not important.

468
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,154
- But who is it?
- You don't know him.

469
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,953
Who is it?!

470
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:11,194
Answer me, damn it.
Who is it?

471
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:16,156
Are you afraid of me?

472
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,588
Why would you be afraid of me?

473
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,280
I never hurt you.
Did I ever hurt you?

474
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,390
You'll kill him.

475
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:31,832
If I tell you, you'll kill him.
It's the only thing you...

476
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,871
Why do you say that?

477
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,310
Why do you say that?
Why?

478
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,752
It's not true.
Why do you say that?

479
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,792
I love you.

480
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,795
Where did you go?

481
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:45,038
I just...

482
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:51,354
I had to...

483
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:59,072
- Can I try that?
- Of course.

484
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:23,989
It's more efficient
if you fire single shots.

485
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:41,233
Aksel asked
if you want to go to Sweden.

486
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:45,154
- To calm your nerves.
- Did he, now?

487
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:50,229
- Tell him my nerves are fine.
- Keep it, Jorgen.

488
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:51,554
I'll get another.

489
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,160
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

490
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:06,995
We can bring it to Japan.
When we're done with the Germans.

491
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,917
We can go to Japan
with the Americans.

492
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:16,353
- Flame and Citron in Japan?
- Exactly.

493
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:34,031
- And after that?
- I don't think there is an "after".

494
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:37,357
Not here. Not for us.

495
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,799
I think we have to move on.

496
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,197
Get up! Come on.

497
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:15,639
Up!

498
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:21,999
Get up!

499
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,878
Mother country!

500
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:45,793
A short while ago the Gestapo
executed three of our men.

501
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:50,471
Bob, Carl and the school teacher
were all shot at Dagmarhus.

502
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:54,872
There's an informer in our midst.

503
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,310
They were turned in, for sure.

504
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:02,151
And an hour ago there were
eight executions at Ryvangen.

505
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:05,835
Our contact in Dagmarhus says
eight more will be shot tonight.

506
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:09,077
Hoffmann is striking back
for Gilbert.

507
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,676
The Communists took the opportunity
to sabotage The Rifle Syndicate, inc.

508
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:18,550
And the Schalburg Corps
just bombed the Tivoli Gardens.

509
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:26,512
Everything points to more retaliation
and more executions.

510
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:30,477
Let's have a moment's silence
in memory of our fallen friends.

511
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:00,193
Soren, are you a bigamist?

512
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:04,030
What?

513
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,915
Do you get into bed with others?

514
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,549
No. Hell, no.

515
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,432
I'd never do that.

516
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:19,875
They were my friends.
We served in Finland together.

517
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:23,316
- Friends inform on friends.
- Shall I shoot him?

518
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:27,433
- I don't know yet.
- I'm not the one, damn it!

519
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,913
What really happened
at Cafe Lauritz Betjent?

520
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:39,955
We were celebrating
the invasion of France.

521
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,672
We were at the bar.

522
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:48,596
Me, Little Bear and Big Bear.

523
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:54,710
We turn around and see
that Bob, Carl and Brains

524
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:57,798
are surrounded by Gestapo men.

525
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:03,355
What could we do...

526
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:06,199
...other than sneak off?

527
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:08,316
What say the Bears?

528
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,389
He's telling the truth.

529
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:16,354
About Cafe Lauritz Betjent.
That's what happened.

530
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:21,833
Alright, Soren. I'm sorry.
But you know how it is.

531
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:26,236
Yes.
I know how it is.

532
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:33,355
I need time, but I'll find the informer.
Keep a low profile.

533
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,398
Vesterbro's in uproar,
so stay clear.

534
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,114
Where were you?

535
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:49,515
Where were you,
when the uprising started?

536
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:56,269
Where were you on June 26th

537
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,675
when Copenhagen resisted?

538
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:05,956
At long last people had had enough.

539
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:09,629
At long last they're
doing something.

540
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,593
It's getting close.

541
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,790
Real war.

542
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:19,514
Already, 32 have fallen,

543
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:22,234
and it's only just begun.

544
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:26,032
The Communists are fighting.

545
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:34,038
But we 're just waiting.

546
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:58,749
Hello, Ketty.

547
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:03,357
How did you get in?

548
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,675
Today's my birthday.

549
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:08,951
And so?
Do you expect me to sing for you?

550
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:12,152
No. I want to take you to dinner.

551
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:15,590
- Who sent you?
- No one.

552
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:24,589
Hoffmann just named you
the number one enemy of Germany.

553
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:28,596
He raised the reward to 20,000
and you break into my room?

554
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:33,714
The city is in uproar,
and you want to go out for dinner?

555
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:38,595
- Have you lost your mind?
- Alright, I'm sorry. I'll leave.

556
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:46,392
You should take care.
Cover your hair.

557
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:47,879
Here.

558
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:06,994
- What did you do before the war?
- Various things.

559
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:11,272
- At one point I was a dancer.
- A dancer?

560
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:14,039
Where?

561
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:17,436
At the Apollo.

562
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:19,869
It was fun.

563
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,912
It wasn't proper, but it was fun.

564
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:27,431
And I met a lot of people.
That's how I met Winther.

565
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:36,552
Winther has helped me
a great deal.

566
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:41,390
- He got me a place to stay and a job.
- He's a great man.

567
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,911
- Do you think so?
- Yes.

568
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:51,149
- Why do you do it?
- Do what?

569
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,550
Kill so many people.

570
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:03,912
- Someone has to.
- But why kill at all?

571
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:06,918
What else can you do?

572
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:13,391
My father sent me
to Germany in 1 940,

573
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:16,318
to train as a waiter
and a chef.

574
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:20,917
The hotel manager was a Nazi.

575
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,639
The chef was a Nazi.

576
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:26,320
Several of the waiters were Nazis.

577
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:30,149
I served Nazis every day.
Everywhere.

578
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:36,719
One of the girls at the hotel
was Jewish, but no one knew.

579
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,318
She kept it secret.

580
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:43,598
But the chef found out.

581
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,995
He turned her in.

582
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:52,035
She was beaten to a pulp
before the police came after her.

583
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,231
I don't want that to happen here.

584
01:05:57,360 --> 01:06:00,591
Sabotage makes no difference.

585
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:04,755
The only thing you can do
is eliminate them. One by one.

586
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:09,197
Down to the last one.

587
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:13,753
Was she your girlfriend?

588
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:19,673
What happened to her?

589
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:27,238
- And you?
- I don't know.

590
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:30,955
The war came as a relief to me.

591
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:34,517
Finally I could do something.
Something right.

592
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:37,438
I stopped dancing
and started working for Winther.

593
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:42,714
Conveying letters. Procuring
information and passing it on.

594
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:49,271
It was fun in the beginning.

595
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:52,434
But it's different now.

596
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:55,358
Everything is grey.

597
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:01,397
I think I just want to survive.

598
01:07:06,458 --> 01:07:08,688
Do you know what I think?

599
01:07:09,098 --> 01:07:13,137
I think we should get out of here.

600
01:07:30,458 --> 01:07:33,575
You have to promise me something.

601
01:07:33,698 --> 01:07:36,974
Don't ever use me for information.

602
01:07:37,538 --> 01:07:42,134
Don't ask me for anything like that.
Don't let that come between us.

603
01:07:42,258 --> 01:07:45,807
- Will you promise me that?
- Yes.

604
01:07:48,778 --> 01:07:52,612
I just wish this war would end.

605
01:07:56,138 --> 01:07:58,857
Why can't I get out of this?

606
01:08:01,138 --> 01:08:04,448
I wish I could leave
and never return.

607
01:08:05,858 --> 01:08:08,213
Where would you go?

608
01:08:10,298 --> 01:08:12,254
To Stockholm.

609
01:08:21,538 --> 01:08:26,407
The war will last
for a good while still.

610
01:08:26,498 --> 01:08:30,127
- But don't be afraid.
- No?

611
01:08:32,258 --> 01:08:35,330
I'll look out for you.

612
01:08:39,538 --> 01:08:43,008
- You will?
- Yes.

613
01:09:05,138 --> 01:09:07,333
My name is Jorgen.

614
01:09:08,698 --> 01:09:11,166
Do you have a minute?

615
01:09:24,258 --> 01:09:25,771
What's your name?

616
01:09:28,058 --> 01:09:30,572
Morten.

617
01:09:34,178 --> 01:09:38,057
I want you to take good care
of my wife and daughter.

618
01:09:39,418 --> 01:09:42,410
- Yes.
- Do you have a job?

619
01:09:43,658 --> 01:09:47,048
- Are you making any money?
- Yes.

620
01:09:57,178 --> 01:10:00,932
Morten, be good to my daughter.
Be very good to her.

621
01:10:01,058 --> 01:10:04,368
If I hear any different...

622
01:10:06,138 --> 01:10:08,493
...I'll be back.

623
01:10:08,618 --> 01:10:12,327
- Is that understood?
- Yes.

624
01:10:50,218 --> 01:10:52,254
One coffee.

625
01:10:59,218 --> 01:11:01,015
You've gotten yourself a hat.

626
01:11:09,218 --> 01:11:11,095
That's good.

627
01:11:26,018 --> 01:11:29,693
- The reward is now 20,000.
- I know.

628
01:11:30,298 --> 01:11:33,335
That could tempt anybody.
Smart move on Hoffmann's part.

629
01:11:33,418 --> 01:11:36,694
- I want an order to shoot him.
- You won't get it.

630
01:11:38,698 --> 01:11:42,168
I have something else for you.
I found the informer.

631
01:11:43,858 --> 01:11:48,329
Unfortunately it's one of us.
Mrs Ketty Selmer Sjoberg.

632
01:11:50,938 --> 01:11:53,293
She is to be liquidated
immediately.

633
01:11:58,578 --> 01:12:01,138
- You're mistaken.
- I am?

634
01:12:01,258 --> 01:12:03,328
I know her.

635
01:12:04,058 --> 01:12:05,650
She's a courier.

636
01:12:05,778 --> 01:12:09,612
- A former dance girl.
- I know all about Ketty.

637
01:12:09,738 --> 01:12:13,970
She's my courier.
She knows everything.

638
01:12:14,098 --> 01:12:16,692
If we don't strike now,
we'll all be shot.

639
01:12:16,818 --> 01:12:19,776
Then why hasn't she
informed on Bent?

640
01:12:19,858 --> 01:12:24,249
Why inform on Carl and Brains,
when Bent will get her 20,000?

641
01:12:24,378 --> 01:12:27,370
You should ask Bent about that.

642
01:12:28,138 --> 01:12:31,289
She's a double agent.
Not loyal to anyone.

643
01:12:31,418 --> 01:12:36,412
Hoffmann cornered her,
and she provided him with information.

644
01:12:36,498 --> 01:12:38,773
And now she's in too deep.

645
01:12:44,618 --> 01:12:46,654
Do you want me to do it?

646
01:12:49,258 --> 01:12:50,771
No.

647
01:13:24,938 --> 01:13:28,453
CONFIDENTIAL

648
01:14:09,938 --> 01:14:12,372
Bent?
What are you doing here?

649
01:14:14,218 --> 01:14:16,209
It's lovely to see you.

650
01:14:18,138 --> 01:14:20,015
Sit down.

651
01:14:38,138 --> 01:14:40,368
Who do you work for?

652
01:14:42,778 --> 01:14:45,053
- Winther, of course.
- Try again.

653
01:14:48,298 --> 01:14:51,256
- Who asked you to draw me?
- No one.

654
01:14:51,378 --> 01:14:53,528
Then why that one?

655
01:14:55,418 --> 01:14:58,410
I was thinking about you.

656
01:15:00,738 --> 01:15:02,808
How come you frequent Dagmarhus?

657
01:15:02,938 --> 01:15:08,012
I need visas.
So that I can travel.

658
01:15:08,138 --> 01:15:09,969
Look.

659
01:15:11,338 --> 01:15:13,613
- Look, visa.
- Who do you work for?

660
01:15:13,698 --> 01:15:17,134
- I can't tell you.
- Who do you work for?

661
01:15:24,018 --> 01:15:27,249
I work for Army Intelligence.

662
01:15:27,538 --> 01:15:29,893
And for Winther.

663
01:15:31,218 --> 01:15:34,210
I traffic documents.

664
01:15:34,738 --> 01:15:37,935
And do different jobs for them.
I follow orders, like you.

665
01:15:38,058 --> 01:15:41,653
You turned them in.
Didn't you?

666
01:15:41,818 --> 01:15:43,968
Why did you turn them in?

667
01:15:45,018 --> 01:15:48,647
- Why did you turn them in?
- What is this?

668
01:15:48,778 --> 01:15:52,088
- How much did they pay you?
- Who's been saying that?

669
01:15:52,218 --> 01:15:54,254
Is it Winther?

670
01:15:56,458 --> 01:15:59,655
He's a swindler.
A thorough scoundrel.

671
01:15:59,778 --> 01:16:03,134
Watch your mouth.
He's under London orders.

672
01:16:03,258 --> 01:16:07,729
- London? They never wanted him.
- That's not true!

673
01:16:07,858 --> 01:16:12,056
- He receives orders.
- Yes, but not from the British!

674
01:16:12,178 --> 01:16:15,250
Let me show you something.

675
01:16:16,858 --> 01:16:22,251
These are all copies of contracts
that Winther made with Gilbert.

676
01:16:26,138 --> 01:16:27,969
I keep copies in Stockholm.

677
01:16:33,658 --> 01:16:37,014
Winther was legal adviser to Gilbert
for years.

678
01:16:37,458 --> 01:16:41,053
They did business together
and made a lot of money.

679
01:16:41,178 --> 01:16:43,772
Serious money, Bent!

680
01:16:44,218 --> 01:16:51,488
But Winther must have realised
that it would be considered treason.

681
01:16:51,618 --> 01:16:54,974
Gilbert was after all
a high-ranking German officer.

682
01:16:55,098 --> 01:17:00,491
So after the war, Winther would be
facing charges of collaboration.

683
01:17:00,618 --> 01:17:04,133
And his close relationship with
Seibold would also be scrutinised.

684
01:17:04,218 --> 01:17:08,177
He would be sent to jail.
This was his only way out.

685
01:17:08,298 --> 01:17:11,210
He had to get rid of them.

686
01:17:11,338 --> 01:17:14,933
Both Gilbert and Seibold.

687
01:17:15,058 --> 01:17:17,492
And he used you.

688
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:26,256
- They're forgeries.
- No, the documents are genuine.

689
01:17:26,378 --> 01:17:29,893
He's nothing but a gangster.
I know too much, and I have proof.

690
01:17:30,018 --> 01:17:34,648
- So now I'm to be shot too.
- They were German spies.

691
01:17:34,778 --> 01:17:36,734
German spies?

692
01:17:36,858 --> 01:17:41,409
No, Gilbert and Mrs Lorentzen
were in the German resistance.

693
01:17:43,778 --> 01:17:48,647
Seibold was a spy.
But you never got him, did you?

694
01:17:55,938 --> 01:18:00,170
Gilbert was an expert at manipulation,
and he had Gestapo bodyguards...

695
01:18:00,298 --> 01:18:02,687
They weren't bodyguards.

696
01:18:02,818 --> 01:18:07,016
Gilbert was under house arrest,
suspected of anti-Nazi activity.

697
01:18:07,138 --> 01:18:12,007
If Hoffmann wanted to protect Gilbert,
you'd never have gotten that close.

698
01:18:12,138 --> 01:18:15,016
Do you think Hoffmann
cries over Gilbert's death?

699
01:18:15,138 --> 01:18:19,336
- No, you did him a favor.
- And Mrs Lorentzen?

700
01:18:20,258 --> 01:18:23,807
She was Gilbert's secretary
and knew of his deals with Winther.

701
01:18:23,938 --> 01:18:26,850
She was also involved
in the opposition to Hitler,

702
01:18:27,418 --> 01:18:32,128
but more than that she was just
a sweet lady caught between two men.

703
01:18:32,498 --> 01:18:34,375
And Winther...?

704
01:18:36,258 --> 01:18:38,852
Does Winther work for the Gestapo?

705
01:18:39,738 --> 01:18:42,810
No, he just erases his own tracks.

706
01:19:01,138 --> 01:19:05,211
- Is Winther here?
- Winther has escaped to Stockholm.

707
01:19:06,018 --> 01:19:08,486
They've unravelled it all.

708
01:19:08,618 --> 01:19:10,654
Get out!

709
01:19:55,378 --> 01:19:59,291
He was right.
Winther has disappeared. He ran for it.

710
01:20:00,498 --> 01:20:03,012
We've been shooting
innocent people.

711
01:20:03,138 --> 01:20:05,527
Aksel never worked for the British.

712
01:20:07,138 --> 01:20:08,935
Anybody who knew anything
was shot.

713
01:20:09,018 --> 01:20:11,976
- Shut up.
- Only Ketty was left.

714
01:20:13,098 --> 01:20:15,931
- We've shot innocent...
- Shut the hell up!

715
01:20:16,058 --> 01:20:18,094
Shut up!

716
01:20:18,458 --> 01:20:21,655
I sure as hell
didn't kill innocent people.

717
01:20:27,018 --> 01:20:32,888
I shot a German officer,
and a German officer is not innocent.

718
01:20:33,098 --> 01:20:37,614
You come here and tell me he was
in the resistance. Are you stupid?

719
01:20:38,378 --> 01:20:43,691
Winther! What did you expect?
That's rich people for you!

720
01:20:43,818 --> 01:20:48,209
In a nutshell!
They're greedy and full of shit.

721
01:20:51,738 --> 01:20:54,411
You should have shot her
when you had the chance.

722
01:20:56,178 --> 01:20:58,373
What are you saying?

723
01:20:58,458 --> 01:21:00,449
- She's fucking with your brain.
- Watch out!

724
01:21:00,538 --> 01:21:06,693
A girl knows your real name, you fuck
her and "bam", she's an oracle.

725
01:21:06,818 --> 01:21:09,537
- Shut up!
- I'll say what I like.

726
01:21:10,258 --> 01:21:14,649
And I never killed innocent people,
do you hear me?

727
01:21:38,658 --> 01:21:41,013
Why didn't I see it?

728
01:21:43,018 --> 01:21:45,168
Why didn't I see it happening?

729
01:21:45,858 --> 01:21:48,133
He's in Stockholm,

730
01:21:48,258 --> 01:21:52,809
while we're being hounded
by the Gestapo.

731
01:21:55,018 --> 01:21:56,371
Is that justice?

732
01:21:58,578 --> 01:22:02,890
There is no just or unjust any longer.
There is war.

733
01:22:04,778 --> 01:22:08,054
We choose our own targets
and go after them.

734
01:22:17,978 --> 01:22:20,128
- Hoffmann.
- Yes.

735
01:22:54,858 --> 01:22:56,769
Come on...

736
01:23:02,098 --> 01:23:04,009
Go, guys.

737
01:23:26,578 --> 01:23:29,888
- Easy now.
- Where is he?

738
01:23:30,458 --> 01:23:32,369
- Where is he?
- In the back.

739
01:23:45,818 --> 01:23:47,171
Flame?

740
01:23:54,778 --> 01:23:56,973
I have a proposal for you.

741
01:23:58,778 --> 01:24:01,850
You leave this place and so do l.

742
01:24:01,938 --> 01:24:04,611
I suspend the hunt for you
for 24 hours.

743
01:24:04,738 --> 01:24:09,334
Go to Sweden and stay there till
the war is over, and this conversation...

744
01:24:09,418 --> 01:24:11,613
...never took place.

745
01:24:24,778 --> 01:24:27,417
Have you considered
the consequences?

746
01:24:27,978 --> 01:24:30,890
If you kill the head of the Gestapo.

747
01:24:32,098 --> 01:24:36,057
- Do you want to survive the war?
- I'll survive.

748
01:24:36,338 --> 01:24:40,490
That would surprise me.
Surviving is not in your character.

749
01:24:41,418 --> 01:24:45,331
You're a fanatic, a terrorist.
They always die.

750
01:24:50,378 --> 01:24:52,255
Tell me...

751
01:24:53,458 --> 01:24:57,292
Do you really think you make
a difference with all your shooting?

752
01:24:57,418 --> 01:25:02,173
Don't you realise you're just a tool
for someone with less pure motives?

753
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:09,936
I thought you were in charge
of all these courageous activities.

754
01:25:10,058 --> 01:25:12,333
But it was Mr Winther.

755
01:25:12,458 --> 01:25:17,486
How could you take him seriously?
He's so untrustworthy.

756
01:25:19,538 --> 01:25:21,813
And now you want to take over.

757
01:25:21,938 --> 01:25:26,409
You're angry and hurt, and now
the Gestapo chief must die. Why?

758
01:25:27,538 --> 01:25:31,133
What will that change?

759
01:25:35,218 --> 01:25:36,367
We're the same.

760
01:25:39,938 --> 01:25:41,929
I love Denmark.

761
01:25:43,058 --> 01:25:45,253
You love Denmark.

762
01:25:47,218 --> 01:25:49,971
The beautiful landscapes
of North Zealand.

763
01:25:52,058 --> 01:25:55,255
Why don't we cooperate?

764
01:25:56,458 --> 01:26:00,337
You're right. The National Socialist
idea is fine but impossible.

765
01:26:00,458 --> 01:26:04,133
Far too many emotions.
Like an infatuation.

766
01:26:05,498 --> 01:26:08,490
See what that idea
has done to the world.

767
01:26:08,618 --> 01:26:11,610
But think of me
as an opportunity.

768
01:26:11,738 --> 01:26:15,128
I have given up on my ideals.
I must survive.

769
01:26:15,258 --> 01:26:20,457
And I want you to survive, too.
What do you say?

770
01:26:27,258 --> 01:26:29,852
I understand.

771
01:26:32,578 --> 01:26:34,455
Fine.

772
01:26:36,098 --> 01:26:37,895
On three.

773
01:26:39,898 --> 01:26:41,968
One.

774
01:26:42,098 --> 01:26:44,896
Two.

775
01:26:45,018 --> 01:26:47,054
Here come the police,

776
01:26:47,178 --> 01:26:51,091
or what's even worse for you,
German soldiers.

777
01:26:51,218 --> 01:26:54,494
Do you plan to stay here
until you're surrounded?

778
01:27:04,898 --> 01:27:06,775
What happened?

779
01:27:07,898 --> 01:27:09,889
What happened?

780
01:27:32,298 --> 01:27:35,210
- You got my message?
- Yes.

781
01:27:36,578 --> 01:27:40,048
- You didn't come alone.
- Neither did you.

782
01:27:40,178 --> 01:27:43,454
It's Spex.
He doesn't trust you.

783
01:27:45,818 --> 01:27:49,777
I have a message,
and I'm to return with your answer.

784
01:27:49,898 --> 01:27:53,686
There's a meeting in Stockholm
the day after tomorrow at 1 0.

785
01:27:53,818 --> 01:27:57,447
- What do they want?
- I don't know.

786
01:27:59,778 --> 01:28:01,416
Who'll be there?

787
01:28:01,538 --> 01:28:04,769
Spex and someone
from the Liberation Council,

788
01:28:04,898 --> 01:28:07,651
and Winther.

789
01:28:07,778 --> 01:28:09,769
- Aksel?
- Yes.

790
01:28:09,898 --> 01:28:12,810
He's been white-washed.

791
01:28:17,258 --> 01:28:20,170
I won't be there.

792
01:28:20,298 --> 01:28:22,653
You should, Bent.

793
01:28:24,778 --> 01:28:29,135
You should go and hear
what they have to say.

794
01:28:29,258 --> 01:28:31,214
It's important.

795
01:28:35,018 --> 01:28:38,693
I asked to be the one
to tell you.

796
01:28:41,378 --> 01:28:43,289
I wanted to see you.

797
01:28:43,418 --> 01:28:47,252
- To see that you were okay.
- I'm fine.

798
01:28:57,058 --> 01:29:00,653
I'll let them know
you'll be there.

799
01:29:06,938 --> 01:29:09,406
- Gentlemen.
- You're back with Winther?

800
01:29:09,538 --> 01:29:13,770
No, we're military now.
They pay well.

801
01:29:13,898 --> 01:29:17,777
I'm afraid we have to
confiscate your equipment.

802
01:29:23,098 --> 01:29:25,453
It's an honour.

803
01:29:27,138 --> 01:29:31,290
I represent the Liberation Council.
They call me Raven.

804
01:29:31,418 --> 01:29:34,455
You know Spex
and Aksel Winther.

805
01:29:39,218 --> 01:29:42,654
The Police Solicitor represents
the American Forces.

806
01:29:42,778 --> 01:29:44,131
Interesting.

807
01:29:46,698 --> 01:29:49,610
I'd like to start the meeting
with some good news.

808
01:29:50,138 --> 01:29:54,290
We're on the verge of a breakthrough
in negotiations with the Germans.

809
01:29:54,378 --> 01:29:56,846
Regarding putting an end
to the insurrection.

810
01:29:58,458 --> 01:30:02,849
It's a great victory for the people.
The curfew will be suspended.

811
01:30:02,978 --> 01:30:07,369
- The Schalburg Corps withdraws...
- If both sides stay calm.

812
01:30:08,498 --> 01:30:10,454
Are you paying attention?

813
01:30:12,338 --> 01:30:16,889
Is everyone here aware of
what the Police Solicitor has done?

814
01:30:18,978 --> 01:30:22,971
He's been ordering us to liquidate
innocent people. Old friends.

815
01:30:23,498 --> 01:30:26,376
- People who got in his way.
- What the hell are you saying?

816
01:30:26,498 --> 01:30:29,695
Who's done more to have Denmark
be recognised by the Allied Forces?

817
01:30:29,778 --> 01:30:35,011
- What old friends, Flame?
- Gilbert, German resistance man.

818
01:30:35,498 --> 01:30:38,808
- Ketty Selmer, Danish courier.
- German resistance man?

819
01:30:41,058 --> 01:30:45,017
My boy. The Allied don't recognise
any German resistance.

820
01:30:45,138 --> 01:30:47,333
It simply doesn't exist.

821
01:30:47,458 --> 01:30:54,296
The incident with Mrs Selmer was
a mistake and has been explained.

822
01:30:54,818 --> 01:30:56,490
A simple misunderstanding...

823
01:31:00,098 --> 01:31:03,886
A misunderstanding... I'm sorry.
A misunderstanding?

824
01:31:04,938 --> 01:31:07,771
And in a minute
when I shoot you...

825
01:31:07,898 --> 01:31:09,695
...it's just a mistake.

826
01:31:11,818 --> 01:31:13,854
Can we agree on that?

827
01:31:15,498 --> 01:31:17,853
I...

828
01:31:17,978 --> 01:31:21,254
...admire you, Flame.

829
01:31:21,858 --> 01:31:27,455
But war can be confusing,
as you well know.

830
01:31:27,578 --> 01:31:30,490
All sorts of information
flies all over the place.

831
01:31:30,618 --> 01:31:33,769
The sensible thing is,

832
01:31:33,898 --> 01:31:35,934
to keep your calm.

833
01:31:38,058 --> 01:31:42,176
The Liberation Council knows of
no liquidations of innocent people,

834
01:31:42,298 --> 01:31:45,893
so with your permission,

835
01:31:46,498 --> 01:31:49,171
maybe we can proceed
with this meeting.

836
01:31:49,298 --> 01:31:52,449
- Are you a Communist, Faurschou?
- No.

837
01:31:53,298 --> 01:31:56,256
How would you feel about
a commission?

838
01:31:56,698 --> 01:32:00,657
You'll command 1 0,000 men
in the waiting groups in Copenhagen.

839
01:32:00,778 --> 01:32:02,530
Rank of Captain.

840
01:32:02,658 --> 01:32:06,207
Captain! There you go, Bent!
Imagine that.

841
01:32:06,338 --> 01:32:10,411
Either you'll fight alongside
the British, if the Germans resist,

842
01:32:10,538 --> 01:32:14,929
or you will be fighting against
the Red Army, if it arrives first.

843
01:32:15,058 --> 01:32:19,290
It's about the survival of democracy,
and we'd like to use your name.

844
01:32:19,418 --> 01:32:23,969
- My name? How so?
- We will need heroes.

845
01:32:24,098 --> 01:32:27,773
Heroes to talk about
in schools and associations.

846
01:32:27,898 --> 01:32:30,207
Heroes for public speeches
to huge crowds,

847
01:32:30,338 --> 01:32:34,047
conveying the unselfish and
sacrificing nature of the resistance.

848
01:32:34,178 --> 01:32:37,693
Which you are both
excellent examples of.

849
01:32:42,858 --> 01:32:47,056
- And Jorgen?
- Second-in-command. Lieutenant?

850
01:32:49,218 --> 01:32:52,847
- What rank are you?
- Captain.

851
01:32:53,898 --> 01:32:55,934
Then I also want to be a captain.

852
01:32:58,258 --> 01:32:59,247
No, thanks.

853
01:32:59,338 --> 01:33:04,537
We will no longer tolerate your acts
of random violence. It's unacceptable.

854
01:33:04,658 --> 01:33:08,731
In wartime you kill
your adversaries.

855
01:33:08,858 --> 01:33:12,817
I want Hoffmann.
Then we can talk commissions.

856
01:33:12,938 --> 01:33:15,930
- Out of the question.
- I respect your stance.

857
01:33:16,058 --> 01:33:19,812
But Hoffmann...

858
01:33:19,938 --> 01:33:22,611
- Nothing good will come of it.
- We'll see.

859
01:33:22,738 --> 01:33:26,208
We have other ways of stopping you.

860
01:33:29,658 --> 01:33:33,970
I apologise on behalf of Spex.
That was uncalled for.

861
01:33:35,698 --> 01:33:40,169
These files contain the name
of an informer in your organisation.

862
01:33:40,738 --> 01:33:43,332
- Where are we going?
- Asserbo.

863
01:33:44,258 --> 01:33:47,056
Accept this as a token
of our good intentions.

864
01:33:48,618 --> 01:33:54,090
- Do you have a photo of him?
- No, only name and address.

865
01:33:58,978 --> 01:34:02,368
- I have to pee.
- Me too.

866
01:34:31,338 --> 01:34:32,851
I'm sorry.

867
01:35:00,378 --> 01:35:02,892
And now what?

868
01:35:03,018 --> 01:35:05,691
Now I go and see my dad.

869
01:35:08,138 --> 01:35:11,528
- Has it been a long time?
- Three years.

870
01:35:14,458 --> 01:35:16,688
Wait here.

871
01:35:18,218 --> 01:35:22,894
Birkegaarden Hotel, Northern Sealand

872
01:35:44,738 --> 01:35:46,376
Hello, Father.

873
01:35:59,858 --> 01:36:02,292
A glass of wine?

874
01:36:06,578 --> 01:36:11,936
- Why have you come?
- To see how my father's doing.

875
01:36:12,058 --> 01:36:15,846
Let's not get carried away.
What do you want?

876
01:36:16,858 --> 01:36:19,656
You have many German guests.

877
01:36:20,138 --> 01:36:23,335
The guests choose the hotel,
not the other way around.

878
01:36:23,858 --> 01:36:28,170
- I hear Hoffmann often stays here.
- Head of the Gestapo?

879
01:36:28,298 --> 01:36:32,450
- I couldn't say.
- I would like to talk to him.

880
01:36:33,738 --> 01:36:38,050
Apparently he's a pleasant man...
and intelligent.

881
01:36:38,178 --> 01:36:39,736
And a murderer for the Nazis.

882
01:36:39,858 --> 01:36:43,692
Yes, there is that.

883
01:36:45,538 --> 01:36:50,009
- You always liked them.
- Them?

884
01:36:50,138 --> 01:36:54,893
I admire the German culture and
all the wonderful things it's fostered.

885
01:36:55,298 --> 01:36:57,493
But "them"?
No.

886
01:36:58,178 --> 01:37:00,294
The war must be
a disappointment to you.

887
01:37:00,418 --> 01:37:05,287
Aren't you listening?
I'm just trying to make ends meet.

888
01:37:07,618 --> 01:37:10,212
But you're too young
to understand that.

889
01:37:10,338 --> 01:37:13,455
And with your background
and brains,

890
01:37:14,458 --> 01:37:17,689
you could have done better
than driving around shooting people.

891
01:37:19,818 --> 01:37:22,651
But then again
you became a hero.

892
01:37:28,218 --> 01:37:30,174
Listen.

893
01:37:32,018 --> 01:37:35,328
If you talk well of me
to your Communist friends,

894
01:37:35,458 --> 01:37:41,249
and promise not to shoot Hoffmann
at the hotel, I'll tell you what I know.

895
01:37:42,738 --> 01:37:44,694
Do we have a deal?

896
01:38:04,778 --> 01:38:09,090
Hoffmann comes here with his family
and his mistresses.

897
01:38:12,218 --> 01:38:17,008
And with four bodyguards
at his side at all times.

898
01:38:22,098 --> 01:38:26,455
I'm only told about his arrival
at the very last minute.

899
01:39:14,698 --> 01:39:18,293
Army Intelligence asked me
to get close to him.

900
01:39:18,418 --> 01:39:20,727
I'm merely following orders.

901
01:39:20,858 --> 01:39:26,012
My dear Ketty. Thank you
for last night. You were enchanting.

902
01:39:27,578 --> 01:39:30,376
Your laughter makes me so happy.

903
01:39:32,378 --> 01:39:35,017
Yours sincerely, Karl Heinz.

904
01:39:35,138 --> 01:39:38,175
You're on first name terms.

905
01:39:41,578 --> 01:39:43,967
This is not about us.

906
01:39:44,098 --> 01:39:49,616
It's bigger than that. My work requires
sacrifice. They ask me and I do it.

907
01:39:49,738 --> 01:39:52,172
Did they ask you to sleep with me?

908
01:39:53,178 --> 01:39:56,409
No, of course they didn't.

909
01:39:58,738 --> 01:40:03,607
- You and me just happened.
- Really?

910
01:40:09,618 --> 01:40:13,531
Listen, Bent.
Hoffmann means nothing to me.

911
01:40:15,538 --> 01:40:18,575
You do!

912
01:40:20,378 --> 01:40:22,938
Do you understand?

913
01:40:32,138 --> 01:40:37,815
Now you'll tell me what car he drives
and his route to Dagmarhus.

914
01:40:37,938 --> 01:40:41,931
- And the registration number.
- Don't ask me to do that.

915
01:40:42,058 --> 01:40:45,653
You promised you wouldn't, Bent.

916
01:40:46,778 --> 01:40:48,655
You promised.

917
01:40:53,618 --> 01:40:55,051
Bent...

918
01:40:55,178 --> 01:40:58,727
I love you.
Do you understand that?

919
01:40:58,858 --> 01:41:01,691
This serves no one.

920
01:41:06,698 --> 01:41:09,974
If I tell you...

921
01:41:11,378 --> 01:41:14,051
...will you then come
to Stockholm with me?

922
01:41:15,938 --> 01:41:19,897
We'll go to Stockholm
and never return.

923
01:41:20,018 --> 01:41:22,896
Will you promise me that?

924
01:41:24,138 --> 01:41:26,698
Promise me.

925
01:41:30,778 --> 01:41:36,171
On odd weeks he drives
a small black Opel Kadett.

926
01:41:37,018 --> 01:41:39,532
23 34 5.

927
01:41:39,658 --> 01:41:45,176
And on even weeks a big Mercedes.
44 1 9 3.

928
01:41:45,778 --> 01:41:47,848
The route is unpredictable.

929
01:41:48,978 --> 01:41:52,095
Sometimes Roskildevej,

930
01:41:52,218 --> 01:41:54,971
and other times Vigerslevvej.

931
01:43:25,698 --> 01:43:29,373
It's not Hoffmann.

932
01:43:32,898 --> 01:43:35,332
Oh, no...

933
01:43:55,218 --> 01:43:57,254
You'll be okay.

934
01:43:57,498 --> 01:44:00,410
You'll be fine.
Don't be afraid.

935
01:44:00,538 --> 01:44:03,291
You'll be fine.

936
01:44:29,418 --> 01:44:31,136
Dearest Bent.

937
01:44:31,258 --> 01:44:34,694
Hoffmann is on to me.

938
01:44:34,818 --> 01:44:37,651
I'm leaving for Stockholm now.

939
01:44:37,778 --> 01:44:41,612
I hope and believe
that you will join me here.

940
01:44:51,138 --> 01:44:53,254
He's dead.

941
01:45:14,138 --> 01:45:16,811
He kept looking at me.

942
01:45:16,938 --> 01:45:20,977
I held him in my arms,
and he kept looking at me.

943
01:45:23,978 --> 01:45:28,130
I could tell that he wanted
to say something but...

944
01:45:29,778 --> 01:45:32,372
...he wasn't able to.

945
01:45:36,298 --> 01:45:40,007
He died before I got there.

946
01:46:05,738 --> 01:46:08,889
Do you still have the police uniforms?

947
01:46:11,978 --> 01:46:15,573
We'll go to Dagmarhus
and ask to see Hoffmann.

948
01:46:15,698 --> 01:46:17,211
We have to.

949
01:46:17,338 --> 01:46:21,854
We'll never get in. Even if we do,
we'll never get out again.

950
01:46:21,978 --> 01:46:24,208
Come, come. Move on.

951
01:46:25,338 --> 01:46:27,329
Next.
Come.

952
01:46:31,818 --> 01:46:34,093
God dammit.

953
01:46:34,858 --> 01:46:37,656
I thought we were rid of them.

954
01:46:43,578 --> 01:46:45,409
Stop! Stop!

955
01:46:45,538 --> 01:46:47,130
Out of the car!

956
01:46:47,258 --> 01:46:51,410
Get out. Can't you hear?
On the ground!

957
01:46:52,218 --> 01:46:53,651
On the ground!

958
01:46:59,658 --> 01:47:01,569
Get into the truck!

959
01:47:01,698 --> 01:47:03,416
Turn around!

960
01:47:07,578 --> 01:47:10,570
Keep moving.
Get up.

961
01:47:17,538 --> 01:47:19,494
Come on!

962
01:47:22,938 --> 01:47:25,896
Faster!
Move!

963
01:47:26,498 --> 01:47:30,491
These two at the end.
Up against the wall!

964
01:47:32,578 --> 01:47:35,968
Against the wall.
Legs one metre apart!

965
01:47:37,338 --> 01:47:41,126
- What's going on?
- They've taken the whole corps.

966
01:47:41,258 --> 01:47:44,967
We're being sent
to a concentration camp.

967
01:47:48,138 --> 01:47:50,891
- Do you have your Baby Browning?
- In my boots.

968
01:47:51,018 --> 01:47:52,576
- And you?
- Yes.

969
01:47:54,258 --> 01:47:58,137
In a second I'll jump the fence,
and you'll run.

970
01:48:05,258 --> 01:48:07,692
See you, Bent.

971
01:48:20,738 --> 01:48:22,330
Get back in line!

972
01:48:37,338 --> 01:48:39,329
Get an ambulance!

973
01:48:39,458 --> 01:48:42,416
Get him out of here!

974
01:49:00,778 --> 01:49:02,814
Water.

975
01:49:04,618 --> 01:49:07,894
- Water.
- Shut up!

976
01:49:09,378 --> 01:49:12,415
- Water.
- Give him some water!

977
01:49:14,418 --> 01:49:17,091
It's in the back!

978
01:49:33,978 --> 01:49:37,050
Safe house,
north of Copenhagen, October 1 944

979
01:49:52,618 --> 01:49:55,178
How are you feeling?

980
01:49:57,098 --> 01:49:58,736
I'm fine.

981
01:49:58,858 --> 01:50:03,090
Too bad I have to get shot through
the lung to be looked after by you.

982
01:50:13,978 --> 01:50:15,775
There.

983
01:50:22,938 --> 01:50:26,726
- I'm going to jail, Marie.
- Jail?

984
01:50:27,098 --> 01:50:30,249
- I don't think so.
- Yes.

985
01:50:30,378 --> 01:50:33,973
I have to go to jail
for the things I've done.

986
01:50:36,738 --> 01:50:39,650
When this is over...

987
01:50:47,538 --> 01:50:50,530
Do you know what I've done?

988
01:50:59,258 --> 01:51:00,976
No.

989
01:51:12,778 --> 01:51:15,292
It'll be okay.

990
01:51:27,258 --> 01:51:30,648
I'll be back tomorrow.

991
01:51:52,538 --> 01:51:55,575
Watch out, Jorgen.

992
01:56:40,818 --> 01:56:42,410
Oh, no, no...

993
01:56:43,858 --> 01:56:47,009
Go to the basement.

994
01:56:47,138 --> 01:56:49,652
Hurry up.

995
01:57:16,658 --> 01:57:19,536
Open the door!
Can't you hear?

996
01:57:25,338 --> 01:57:27,329
Open the door!

997
01:57:28,458 --> 01:57:31,336
Open this door!

998
01:59:29,018 --> 01:59:31,134
Flame?

999
01:59:31,258 --> 01:59:35,092
Are you Flame?
Say something!

1000
01:59:35,218 --> 01:59:37,334
Get some milk!

1001
02:00:29,658 --> 02:00:31,216
Stop it!

1002
02:00:34,178 --> 02:00:37,090
What do you think you're doing?

1003
02:00:37,178 --> 02:00:39,169
Have you no sense of decency?

1004
02:00:42,138 --> 02:00:45,130
- Cover them up.
- Yes, sir!

1005
02:01:14,698 --> 02:01:18,213
The money order
for the 20,000 kroner reward.

1006
02:01:18,298 --> 02:01:20,687
You can cash it tomorrow.

1007
02:01:40,938 --> 02:01:44,408
We also found a letter
at his place.

1008
02:01:46,338 --> 02:01:47,691
It's for you.

1009
02:02:06,658 --> 02:02:09,889
Do you remember
when they arrived?

1010
02:02:11,218 --> 02:02:14,255
Do you remember
April 9th?

1011
02:02:15,738 --> 02:02:17,729
I think you do.

1012
02:02:17,858 --> 02:02:20,088
Everybody does.

1013
02:02:21,218 --> 02:02:24,369
I've been thinking
and thinking...

1014
02:02:24,498 --> 02:02:29,811
No matter what they say,
I don 't believe it was you.

1015
02:02:29,938 --> 02:02:32,054
You're not like that.

1016
02:02:38,338 --> 02:02:43,014
Where do we go after this?
When it's all over.

1017
02:02:44,338 --> 02:02:47,535
I don 't know.

1018
02:02:47,658 --> 02:02:50,411
Can we ever go back?

1019
02:02:50,538 --> 02:02:52,768
Can we ever go forward?

1020
02:02:53,738 --> 02:02:55,217
Perhaps.

1021
02:02:56,418 --> 02:02:58,170
Perhaps not.

1022
02:02:59,698 --> 02:03:03,247
At this moment there is only
The Flame.

1023
02:03:47,298 --> 02:03:52,816
After the Liberation, Flame and
Citron received a grand funeral.

1024
02:03:52,898 --> 02:03:57,813
In the days following the service
their coffins stood side by side.

1025
02:03:57,898 --> 02:04:01,527
A few months later Flame's father
passed away.

1026
02:04:03,938 --> 02:04:08,887
In 1 951 Citron was awarded the
US government's Medal of Freedom.

1027
02:04:08,978 --> 02:04:12,971
It was accepted by Citron's mother.

1028
02:04:13,098 --> 02:04:18,013
Flame received the same distinction.

1029
02:04:20,698 --> 02:04:24,816
Bodil fled to Sweden where she
gave birth to a daughter, Lone.

1030
02:04:24,898 --> 02:04:28,447
After the Liberation she settled
down in a house near Copenhagen,

1031
02:04:28,538 --> 02:04:31,530
where she and her daughters
lived alone for many years.

1032
02:04:31,618 --> 02:04:34,928
The fate of Citron impacted
the family throughout the years.

1033
02:04:37,338 --> 02:04:42,332
After Flame died,
Ketty Selmer moved to Stockholm.

1034
02:04:42,418 --> 02:04:49,017
She then settled down in Majorca,
where she died in the mid '90s.

1035
02:04:49,098 --> 02:04:51,532
She never spoke of Flame.
