The bell!

[Ringing Stops]

00:03:12,186 --> 00:03:14,086
[Man]
Ugh! Tastes like
old chicken wire.

8
00:03:14,188 --> 00:03:17,180
[Woman]
Yes, but you've
taken off 20 pounds.

[Sputtering]

10
00:03:19,793 --> 00:03:22,261
Au revoir.

11
00:03:22,363 --> 00:03:24,593
Oh! How is he
this morning?

12
00:03:24,698 --> 00:03:28,532
Tolerably well.
He says his liver's acting up
a bit, but, you know.

13
00:03:28,636 --> 00:03:32,128
Ah, good morning.
And how is poor,
dear Mr. Kidley?

14
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,673
His gall bladder spent
a rather peaceful night.

15
00:03:34,775 --> 00:03:37,437
Ah, that's good.
That's good.
Splendid. Splendid.

16
00:03:37,544 --> 00:03:40,604
However, he complains
of a shooting pain
in his sacroiliac.

17
00:03:40,714 --> 00:03:44,912
Oh, good morning.
Isn't he the Kidley
of Kidley's Korn Plasters?

18
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:47,180
Kidley's Beans, madam,
if you don't mind.

19
00:03:47,288 --> 00:03:51,418
Oh.
I ate some once.
Very tasty.

20
00:03:51,525 --> 00:03:53,425
Thank you, madam.

21
00:03:53,527 --> 00:03:55,427
Ah, Jeepers.
Good morning.

22
00:03:55,529 --> 00:03:57,429
How is Mr. Kidley
this morning?

23
00:03:57,531 --> 00:03:59,431
Up and down-ish,
thank you, sir.

24
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:02,229
His liver was a bit
squeamish during the night.
That's nice.

25
00:04:02,336 --> 00:04:04,566
Did he invent
the Kidley Bean?

26
00:04:04,672 --> 00:04:07,004
His grandfather did,
madam.

27
00:04:07,107 --> 00:04:10,235
I understand
Mr. Kidley inherited
quite a little money.

28
00:04:10,344 --> 00:04:13,541
$20 Million, madam.
I shouldn't call that
"a little."

29
00:04:13,647 --> 00:04:15,547
Please, please.
Yes!

Yes, sir.

Is that you,

Yes, sir.

Oh, Jeepers,
I'm a very sick man.

35
00:04:27,594 --> 00:04:30,028
Very sick.

36
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:33,622
Will you take that?

37
00:04:33,734 --> 00:04:35,634
Oh, it's terrible.

38
00:04:38,505 --> 00:04:40,632
Normal, sir.
Oh, but it can't be!

39
00:04:40,741 --> 00:04:42,800

sir, right on the nose.

broken again.

If I may say so, sir,
it's all poppycock.

You're as healthy
as a fire horse.

Oh! Oh, is that so?

44
00:04:53,253 --> 00:04:56,381
Well, why do you think
I came to Switzerland,
to yodel?

45
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,390
And how about yesterday?

46
00:04:58,492 --> 00:05:01,825
That dizzy spell
when I fell downstairs?
You saw me yourself.

downstairs, sir.

- Well, l...

Well, you wait till
I see Dr. Schmidt
this afternoon.

00:05:14,308 --> 00:05:17,072
He'll tell you
what I've got.
Dr. Schmidt!

53
00:05:17,177 --> 00:05:20,044
Yes. Dr. Schmidt
is the biggest

00:05:20,147 --> 00:05:22,240
Very well, sir.
Whatever he says goes.

You're not getting
a chill, sir?

56
00:05:27,955 --> 00:05:30,116
No. I forgot
to shake the bottle.

Don't let me
forget that, Jeepers.

for your romances.

and cool off.

she falls in love

and then, uh...

there was a doctor,
and he told me that...

- After we're married.
- Oh, uh... [Laughs]

Yeah. Yeah.
But I understood... I mean,
what about your husband?

have to worry about Pierre.

Everything was settled
that wonderful night
you danced with me.

111
00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:14,019
I knew how you felt
when you held me close...

112
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:16,988
and whispered,
"You, you,
it's got to be you."

113
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,293
Yes, but that was a song,
Mrs. Marko.

114
00:08:19,293 --> 00:08:20,191
Yes, but that was a song,
Mrs. Marko.

115
00:08:20,294 --> 00:08:22,194
? You, you
It's gotta be you ?

116
00:08:22,296 --> 00:08:24,196
? You wonderful you
No one but you ??

Don't you remember?
I remember.

118
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:28,360
Darling, of course
it's going to be me.
Oh.

119
00:08:28,468 --> 00:08:31,767
And then you remember later,
when you...
Oh, did I?

120
00:08:31,872 --> 00:08:34,136
[Laughs]
Well, that was the elevator.

121
00:08:34,241 --> 00:08:38,041
You see, l-I just went,
and I got off.
It'll happen.

122
00:08:38,145 --> 00:08:41,012
John, do you know what first
attracted me to you?

123
00:08:41,114 --> 00:08:44,641
Yeah, well, I guess you had
20 million reasons,
eh, Mrs. Marko?

124
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:47,584
You're the only one
in the whole world
who believes in me.

125
00:08:47,688 --> 00:08:50,987
The others are always
pointing accusing fingers,
just because of DeBaupre.

126
00:08:51,091 --> 00:08:53,355
DeBaupre?
Yes. He was the one
before Pierre.

127
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,951
- Oh, he's the one
they said you shot.
- It's not true!

128
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:59,260
- It's a wicked, slanderous lie!
- Oh, I should say it is.

129
00:08:59,366 --> 00:09:01,960
Just because you were there
and there were holes
in him, Mrs. Marko...

130
00:09:02,069 --> 00:09:04,037
is no reason
why people should...

131
00:09:04,137 --> 00:09:07,800
I was acquitted.
Just because I'm impulsive
and quick tempered, people talk.

132
00:09:07,908 --> 00:09:10,376
Yes, and with you being
an Olympic pistol champion...

133
00:09:10,477 --> 00:09:12,968
You too!
Oh, pardon me.

134
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,548
John, what you just said
is what the police said.

135
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:18,516
You don't dare
to think that l...
Why, no, Mrs. Marko.

136
00:09:18,619 --> 00:09:22,055
I think you're as innocent
as a child... a small child.
Way down...

137
00:09:22,155 --> 00:09:24,055
[Marko]
We're going to be
very happy together.

138
00:09:24,157 --> 00:09:26,990
- Don't you think so, John?
- You're the type of woman
I admire.

139
00:09:27,094 --> 00:09:30,586
I'd marry you
just like that,
if it weren't for...

140
00:09:30,697 --> 00:09:35,066
If it weren't for what?
Well, if it weren't for your
present husband, Mr. Marko.

141
00:09:35,168 --> 00:09:38,695
Oh. I thought I told you.

142
00:09:38,805 --> 00:09:41,205
[Sighing]
Oh, poor Pierre!

143
00:09:41,308 --> 00:09:43,242
Yes, poor Pierre.
L...

144
00:09:43,343 --> 00:09:45,243
"Poor Pierre"?
What happened to him?

145
00:09:45,345 --> 00:09:47,245
He fell off
the Matterhorn.

146
00:09:47,347 --> 00:09:49,611
Oh, that's too...
That's a mountain!

147
00:09:49,716 --> 00:09:53,277
Thirteen thousand,
six hundred
and sixty-nine feet.

148
00:09:53,387 --> 00:09:55,719
He was never found.

149
00:09:55,822 --> 00:09:58,484
Did they look?
Were you there,
Mrs. Marko?

150
00:09:58,592 --> 00:10:00,651
Oh, I saw it all.
It was horrible.

151
00:10:00,761 --> 00:10:03,855
Why, when it happened,
l-I wasn't a foot behind him.
Think of that.

152
00:10:03,964 --> 00:10:05,864
I'll bet you could have
reached right out...

153
00:10:05,966 --> 00:10:09,367
and touched him,
eh, Mrs. Marko?
Easily.

154
00:10:12,606 --> 00:10:15,302
Seven years.
Seven years.

155
00:10:15,409 --> 00:10:17,673
That's how long we'll
have to wait, Mrs. Marko.

156
00:10:17,778 --> 00:10:20,713
When a husband disappears,
you have to wait seven years.

157
00:10:20,814 --> 00:10:22,805
Not in mountain climbing.
I'd be willing
to bet.

158
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:25,544
Oh, you'd lose.
I stopped in Geneva
to find out.

159
00:10:25,652 --> 00:10:27,916
I had the same lawyers
as the League of Nations.

160
00:10:28,021 --> 00:10:31,047
Oh.
I'm entirely free.

161
00:10:31,158 --> 00:10:33,149
Oh, well, Mrs. Marko,
you wouldn't want
to marry me.

162
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,558
I'm a hopeless invalid.
I'm liable to die, just like that.

163
00:10:35,662 --> 00:10:37,653
You mistrust me!
You act as though you
don't want to marry me.

164
00:10:37,764 --> 00:10:39,664
Why, I've told everyone
I came here to...

165
00:10:39,766 --> 00:10:41,734
Shh! Don't.

166
00:10:41,835 --> 00:10:46,033
Oh, I must control myself.
I mustn't lose my temper.

167
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:49,336
No, no.
Don't do that!
No! Uh, oh.

168
00:10:49,443 --> 00:10:52,276
You do intend to marry me,
don't you, John?
Why...

169
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:54,574
Well, uh, l-l...

170
00:10:54,681 --> 00:10:57,013
Let...

171
00:10:57,117 --> 00:10:59,017
I'll get it.

172
00:11:00,287 --> 00:11:02,312
You do...

173
00:11:02,422 --> 00:11:04,390
don't you, John?

174
00:11:04,491 --> 00:11:08,894
Oh, sure.
No other thought ever
entered my mind, Mrs. Marko.

175
00:11:08,995 --> 00:11:11,429
Then that's settled.

176
00:11:11,531 --> 00:11:13,431
I'll go and change.
Yes.

177
00:11:13,533 --> 00:11:15,433
And then we'll
set the date.

178
00:11:17,838 --> 00:11:19,738
Date.
[Door Closes]

179
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,831
Jeepers!

180
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,810
I gathered from what
I overheard, sir...

181
00:11:25,912 --> 00:11:27,846
that we're
in a slight miasma, sir.

182
00:11:27,948 --> 00:11:29,848
Miasma is right.

183
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:32,043
I should advise
a firm stand.

184
00:11:32,152 --> 00:11:34,052
I had a brother-in-law...
since deceased...

185
00:11:34,154 --> 00:11:36,782
who sponged lions
for a living, sir.

186
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:39,552
He always said...
Oh, shut up, Jeepers!

187
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:42,753
Feel my pulse.
It's doing that again.

188
00:11:42,863 --> 00:11:45,388
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

189
00:11:45,499 --> 00:11:48,434
Waltzing?
Yes, sir.

190
00:11:48,535 --> 00:11:51,129
I'd better drop down
to the chemist's, sir,
and get your acidity test.

191
00:11:51,238 --> 00:11:54,469
Oh, yes. Good.
I'll meet you
at Dr. Schmidt's.

192
00:11:56,576 --> 00:12:00,569
And as for Mrs. Marko,
I should tell her
to go fry an egg.

193
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,841
Yeah, and get shot down
like a clay pigeon.

194
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:07,409
"The coward dies
a thousand deaths,
the hero dies but once."

195
00:12:12,025 --> 00:12:13,925
Do hurry, Marjorie.

196
00:12:14,027 --> 00:12:15,927
Oh, yes, but these
lovely little fish!

197
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:17,929
Doesn't it frighten
the fish?

198
00:12:18,031 --> 00:12:19,931
Not at all, madam.
They grow to love it.

199
00:12:20,033 --> 00:12:22,001
The acidity test
for Mr. Kidley, please.
Of course.

200
00:12:22,102 --> 00:12:25,071
What does it do?
Just one moment,
madam, please.

201
00:12:25,172 --> 00:12:29,404
Knoodle, Kneck,
Kipper, Kidley.
Ah. Here we are.

202
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:33,240
Ah, now I remember
what I want...
Corn plasters.

203
00:12:33,346 --> 00:12:35,678
But the gentleman was...
Oh, but I was
here first.

204
00:12:35,782 --> 00:12:37,807
Excuse, please.
Now, these we recommend.

205
00:12:37,918 --> 00:12:40,716
That will be
two samelkas, please.

206
00:12:40,821 --> 00:12:43,790
Here you are.
And ten samelkas.

207
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,915
Two samelkas.
Thank you.

208
00:12:46,026 --> 00:12:49,393
I've been waiting here
for the analysis for Kipper.

209
00:12:49,496 --> 00:12:52,932
He's been a little bit
off color lately.
Haven't you, Kipper?

210
00:12:53,033 --> 00:12:55,900
Oh, poor little
poochie-woochie.

211
00:12:56,002 --> 00:12:58,994
[Barks]
Why, you nasty
little dog, you!

212
00:12:59,105 --> 00:13:01,232
[Chuckling]
The name was Kipper,
wasn't it?

213
00:13:01,341 --> 00:13:03,241
Ja, Kipper.
Ja, ja, ja, ja.
Uh, Kidley...

214
00:13:03,343 --> 00:13:05,277
Kornbostle,
Kreutzenheimer.

215
00:13:05,378 --> 00:13:07,437
I was certain
that was here
a moment ago.

216
00:13:07,547 --> 00:13:12,211
Knoodle, Kneck,
Kidley, Kornbostle.

217
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,652
I can't understand it.

218
00:13:15,755 --> 00:13:18,417
[Man]
Breathe in, breathe out.

219
00:13:18,525 --> 00:13:21,255
Breathe in, breathe out.

220
00:13:21,361 --> 00:13:23,352
Good. Very good.

221
00:13:23,463 --> 00:13:25,795
Yeah, but Doctor,
I'm worried about
those three white spots.

222
00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:28,129
I am not worried
about them.
You're not?

223
00:13:28,235 --> 00:13:30,795
No. They are the buttons
on your under trousers.

224
00:13:30,904 --> 00:13:32,804
Oh.
[Laughs]
That is all.

225
00:13:34,574 --> 00:13:36,474
Step out.

226
00:13:38,478 --> 00:13:40,412
Here, Maria.

227
00:13:40,513 --> 00:13:42,413
[Knocking]

228
00:13:46,353 --> 00:13:49,447
Mr. Kidley's acidity test.
Here I am, sir.

229
00:13:49,556 --> 00:13:51,649
Ah. Here we are.

230
00:13:51,758 --> 00:13:54,226
I have very much
expect this...

231
00:14:00,834 --> 00:14:03,928
But this is marvelous!
[Kidley]
What is it, Doc?

232
00:14:04,037 --> 00:14:08,406
You've got 162 acidity...
three times normal!

233
00:14:08,508 --> 00:14:11,306
Oh, well that's fine.
That's great.
Or is it?

234
00:14:11,411 --> 00:14:16,348
Is it? My friend,
with your acidity,
you can digest bones.

235
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:19,714
You mean bones?
But I don't like bones.

236
00:14:19,819 --> 00:14:21,787
You not only can,
but you will...

237
00:14:21,888 --> 00:14:24,152
your bones
and everything else.

238
00:14:24,257 --> 00:14:26,885
You will completely
digest yourself.

239
00:14:26,993 --> 00:14:29,518
W-W...
You-You mean I'm...

240
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:31,688
I'm gonna pass away?
Pass away?

241
00:14:31,798 --> 00:14:33,698
You will disappear!

242
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,736
Thinner and thinner,
smaller and smaller...

243
00:14:37,837 --> 00:14:41,500
until finally...
pfft!
Pfft?

244
00:14:41,608 --> 00:14:44,543
Now I know what is
the matter with you.

245
00:14:44,644 --> 00:14:48,239
You have got
Acidatus Canis...
the acidity of a dog.

246
00:14:48,348 --> 00:14:51,715
A dog?
It is very, very rare.
Oh, very rare.

247
00:14:51,818 --> 00:14:54,514
Not once in 700 years
does it turn up.

248
00:14:56,089 --> 00:14:58,922
Acidity.
Acid mouth.

249
00:14:59,025 --> 00:15:02,586
Acidity...
Ah! Here we are.

250
00:15:02,696 --> 00:15:05,563
"The last case was
a Greek shepherd boy.

251
00:15:05,665 --> 00:15:07,997
His name was Peropilis."

252
00:15:08,101 --> 00:15:11,832
Well, what happened
to him?
Unfortunately, nobody knows.

253
00:15:11,938 --> 00:15:14,634
"On the last day,
he went out
with his sheep...

254
00:15:14,741 --> 00:15:17,869
Yes?
And they found
only his footprints."

255
00:15:19,512 --> 00:15:22,811
Yeah, well, look, Doc.
I mean, how long
have I got?

256
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:26,852
Oh, ten, twenty,
maybe thirty days.

257
00:15:26,953 --> 00:15:29,478
D-Days?
Oh!

258
00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:34,185
But why should you care?
In the history of medicine,
you will live forever.

259
00:15:34,294 --> 00:15:36,956
You are the first
human dog.

260
00:15:37,063 --> 00:15:40,931
L-I'm...
[Coughing]

261
00:15:41,034 --> 00:15:43,195
[Barks]
What was that?

262
00:15:43,303 --> 00:15:45,203
Ah. Erno.

263
00:15:45,305 --> 00:15:47,273
[Barking]
Jeepers!

264
00:15:47,374 --> 00:15:51,242
Doc! Doc!
Never mind writing me up.
What I want to know is...

265
00:15:51,344 --> 00:15:54,541
Look, Erno.
The body is still
round and fat.

266
00:15:54,647 --> 00:15:56,911
The face is still smooth.

267
00:15:57,017 --> 00:16:00,885
But in the eyes already
show the ravages of-of...

268
00:16:00,987 --> 00:16:02,887
We've got to give it
a name.

269
00:16:02,989 --> 00:16:04,957
I'll call it
"Schmidt's Disease."

270
00:16:05,058 --> 00:16:06,992
After you?
After me.

271
00:16:07,093 --> 00:16:09,755
Down the centuries,
students will read of this.

272
00:16:09,863 --> 00:16:13,390
Side by side we will
live through all eternity...

273
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,298
Schmidt and his disease.

274
00:16:16,403 --> 00:16:18,564
We must send it
to the journal.
Oh, yes.

275
00:16:18,671 --> 00:16:22,072
All the newspapers.
The whole world.

276
00:16:22,175 --> 00:16:24,837
Doc, look! Look, Doc.
It's started already.

277
00:16:24,944 --> 00:16:26,969
I'm shrinking!
L... l...

278
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,345
That is my hat.
Oh.
[Laughs]

279
00:16:46,066 --> 00:16:49,263
If I may say so, sir,
I don't think you
put up much of a fight.

280
00:16:49,369 --> 00:16:51,303
Jeepers,
you talk like a fool.

281
00:16:51,404 --> 00:16:54,202
Have you ever
seen Mrs. Marko
at target practice?

282
00:16:54,307 --> 00:16:57,640
Why, she can shoot
the head off a pin
at 100 yards.

283
00:16:57,744 --> 00:17:00,713
But didn't you tell her,
sir, that you only had
30 days to live?

284
00:17:00,814 --> 00:17:02,714
Yeah. That was
my fatal mistake.

285
00:17:02,816 --> 00:17:06,775
Three minutes after I told her,
she had me signing
on a lot of dotted lines.

286
00:17:06,886 --> 00:17:10,151
I'll fix it with flowers,
and it will look beautiful.

287
00:17:10,256 --> 00:17:12,247
All right.
Now, what
about the time?

288
00:17:12,358 --> 00:17:14,849
I can push you in
and your gentleman
at 3:30.

289
00:17:14,961 --> 00:17:16,861
Oh, couldn't you
make it 4:00?

290
00:17:16,963 --> 00:17:19,591
Marrying on the half hour
has been unlucky for me.
No. Impossible!

291
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:23,328
At 4:00 I marry
his Highness Prince Smirnov
to a young lady from Texas.

292
00:17:23,436 --> 00:17:25,597
[Chuckles]
That's where
the cows come from.

293
00:17:25,705 --> 00:17:29,607
Very well.
Mr. Kidley and I
will be here at 3:30.

294
00:17:29,709 --> 00:17:29,976
They say cremation's
awfully nice, sir.

295
00:17:29,976 --> 00:17:32,171
They say cremation's
awfully nice, sir.

296
00:17:32,278 --> 00:17:34,178
Jeepers!
Just trying
to be helpful, sir.

297
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,180
Well, stop it.
Have you got a cigar?

298
00:17:36,282 --> 00:17:38,876
Yes, indeed, sir.
Shall I smoke it
for you?

299
00:17:38,985 --> 00:17:42,648
No, I'll smoke it myself.
What does it matter now?
That's the spirit, sir.

300
00:17:42,755 --> 00:17:44,655
As the poet says,
"Come fill the cup...

301
00:17:44,757 --> 00:17:47,191
for the bird's
on the wing."

302
00:17:47,293 --> 00:17:49,193
That's good.

303
00:17:49,295 --> 00:17:51,490
I'm just beginning to realize
what a swell old world
this is...

304
00:17:51,598 --> 00:17:54,897
now that I've only
got thirty days.
Twenty-nine now, sir.

305
00:17:57,137 --> 00:17:59,367
Jeepers, I've got
to do something
about my money.

306
00:17:59,472 --> 00:18:01,997
If I leave it to Mrs. Marko,
she'll use it to start a war.

307
00:18:02,108 --> 00:18:04,008
[Man]
I'm tellin'you,
you'll do like I say!

308
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,874
You'll marry Smirnov
if I have to
hogtie you!

309
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:10,381
[Woman]
No! I won't! No!
Do exactly as I say!

310
00:18:10,483 --> 00:18:12,974
Look out!

311
00:18:13,086 --> 00:18:14,986
Well!
Well!

312
00:18:18,691 --> 00:18:21,455
Well, I don't blame her.

313
00:18:21,561 --> 00:18:24,655
Whatever it is,
he's wrong.

314
00:18:24,764 --> 00:18:28,097
Home, Jeepers.
Yes, sir.

315
00:18:32,605 --> 00:18:34,505
[Loud Pop]

316
00:18:41,014 --> 00:18:43,482
[Man]
Mighty proud to be his wife,
that's what you ought to be.

317
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:47,519
Mighty proud!
Why, Smirnov's folks
goes back 40 generations.

318
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,952
Well, why don't he
go back with 'em?
[Sobbing]

319
00:18:50,056 --> 00:18:51,956
"Don't do this.
Don't do that.

320
00:18:52,058 --> 00:18:53,958
Don't wear this.
Don't wear that."

321
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,460
Trying to make
a lady out of me!

322
00:18:56,563 --> 00:19:00,693
Always licking my hand
like a St. Bernard dog.
Oh, I hate him!

323
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,700
Now, we didn't traipse
all the way...

324
00:19:02,802 --> 00:19:05,168
from Eagle Heights, Texas,
to Bad Gaswasser...

325
00:19:05,271 --> 00:19:07,239
just so you could
back out now.

326
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:11,401
But, Pa,
I love Henry Munch!

327
00:19:11,511 --> 00:19:13,411
Aww!

328
00:19:15,114 --> 00:19:17,981
Oh, Henny-Penny!
They're trying
to pull us apart.

329
00:19:18,084 --> 00:19:22,248
Oh, Henny,
coochie-woochie!

330
00:19:22,355 --> 00:19:24,755
Aw, coochie-woochie-woochie!

331
00:19:24,857 --> 00:19:27,417
Oh, Daddy, no, don't!
Munch is a no-account
bus driver!

332
00:19:27,527 --> 00:19:30,018
From Eagle Heights
to Silver Falls.

333
00:19:30,129 --> 00:19:32,256
I don't care.
I love him
just the same.

334
00:19:32,365 --> 00:19:34,765
That Smirnov's nothing
but a dressed-up coyote.

335
00:19:34,867 --> 00:19:38,132
Dressed or undressed,
you're marrying him at 4:00.

336
00:19:38,238 --> 00:19:41,036
Well, Henry was good enough
when we were nothing
but poor scrub farmers.

337
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,836
Ever since we struck oil
and got to wearin' shoes...

338
00:19:43,943 --> 00:19:46,173
you've been gettin'
mighty nose-high, Pa.

339
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:50,272
You're goin'
back home a princess,
just like I told 'em.

340
00:19:50,383 --> 00:19:53,511
By hooky, they'll let me
into the country club
and everything then.

341
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,953
I'll show 'em!
That bunch always
lookin' down on me.

342
00:19:57,056 --> 00:19:58,956
If they could only
patch up a man...

343
00:19:59,058 --> 00:20:00,958
as easily as they can
a bicycle tire.

344
00:20:02,595 --> 00:20:06,190
[Loud Pop]
[Laughing]

345
00:20:08,468 --> 00:20:10,368
Imagine me laughing
in my condition.

346
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:13,633
You're going through with it,
and that's my final say!

347
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,868
I won't.
I won't, I won't,
I won't, I won't!

348
00:20:16,976 --> 00:20:20,309
I'll... I'll run away.
I'll... I'll do
something desperate.

349
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:33,252
Hey!
Jeepers, that girl!

350
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:35,919
Mr. Kidley! No!

351
00:20:39,265 --> 00:20:41,290
Oh!

352
00:20:41,401 --> 00:20:45,428
Help! Help!
Oh! Wait!
Careful!

353
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:47,438
Help!

354
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,441
Why, you...

355
00:20:57,317 --> 00:21:01,583
- Oh, Miss, please!
- I'll save you. Take it easy.

356
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,525
Let me, sir!
Let me, please!

357
00:21:07,627 --> 00:21:09,618
Oh, darn fool.

358
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:21,939
Oh! Oh!

359
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,236
Get her! Save her!
Get her!
Hey, wait a minute!

360
00:21:24,344 --> 00:21:29,043
Wait.
Are you all right?
Oh! Oh. Oh.

361
00:21:29,148 --> 00:21:32,345
Oh, say!
Oh, thanks.
You saved my life.

362
00:21:32,452 --> 00:21:34,784
Well, why did you do it?
Why didn't you
let me alone?

363
00:21:34,887 --> 00:21:36,787
You-You can't
even swim.

364
00:21:36,889 --> 00:21:39,949
Apart from his morning tub,
Miss, he's never been
in the water in his life.

365
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:41,959
Well, then,
why did you do it?

366
00:21:42,061 --> 00:21:43,995
It was marvelous...
I mean, wonderful...

367
00:21:44,097 --> 00:21:47,589
[Sobbing]
But why did you do it?

368
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,931
Well, you see, l...
Any man would have
done the same.

369
00:21:51,037 --> 00:21:53,267
I couldn't get
the inner tube
off my neck, sir.

370
00:21:53,373 --> 00:21:55,341
Look. Look, you.
You...

371
00:21:55,441 --> 00:21:57,341
Don't you ever do
anything like that...

372
00:21:57,443 --> 00:21:59,343
no matter what
your troubles are.

373
00:21:59,445 --> 00:22:01,345
This world's a pretty nice
place to live in.

374
00:22:01,447 --> 00:22:03,347
Think of the sunshine,
and the bees...

375
00:22:03,449 --> 00:22:05,349
and the butterflies
and the breeze and the...
and the...

376
00:22:05,451 --> 00:22:07,351
What's that thing
about the cup?

377
00:22:07,453 --> 00:22:09,944
"Come fill the cup.
The bird's on the wing."

378
00:22:10,056 --> 00:22:12,081
Yeah, you see?
The bird's on the wing.
What bird?

379
00:22:12,191 --> 00:22:15,058
Well, uh...
What bird, Jeepers?
Just a figure of speech, sir.

380
00:22:15,161 --> 00:22:18,289
Come along, sir.
We mustn't precipitate
your demise. Pneumonia!

381
00:22:18,398 --> 00:22:21,595
Come on.
You're liable to catch
your death of cold if you...

382
00:22:21,701 --> 00:22:23,601
Oh, me.
[Coughs]

383
00:22:23,703 --> 00:22:26,263
[Barking]

384
00:22:28,307 --> 00:22:30,332
I just wish
you knew my Henry.

385
00:22:30,443 --> 00:22:33,742
He's so big, and strong
and-and cute.

386
00:22:33,846 --> 00:22:35,746
Why, he'd do
anything for me.

387
00:22:35,848 --> 00:22:37,748
You know,
when we were kids, he...

388
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:41,183
he ate a beetle, just
'cause I asked him to.

389
00:22:41,287 --> 00:22:44,279
Sounds like a handy fella
to have around a garden.

390
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:46,517
Yeah, but that's
all over with now.

391
00:22:46,626 --> 00:22:48,821
At 4:00 I've
got to marry Smirnov.

392
00:22:48,928 --> 00:22:50,919
Yeah, but this is 1939.

393
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:53,089
You don't have to go around
jumping off bridges.

394
00:22:53,199 --> 00:22:56,032
You don't know Pa.

395
00:22:56,135 --> 00:22:58,035
But what are my troubles
compared to yours?

396
00:22:58,137 --> 00:23:01,231
I mean, you being
a human dog and everything.

397
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:04,776
Yeah. Acidatus Canis.

398
00:23:04,877 --> 00:23:07,072
You know, while we're
sitting here, Mickey,
you know what I'm doin'?

399
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,148
Uh-uh.
I'm digesting myself.

400
00:23:09,248 --> 00:23:11,443
Huh?
Bones and all.

401
00:23:11,551 --> 00:23:13,576
I'm getting smaller
and smaller.

402
00:23:13,686 --> 00:23:16,348
First a pygmy,
then a radiator ornament...

403
00:23:16,456 --> 00:23:19,550
then a watch charm,
and finally... pfft.

404
00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:23,823
Just a memory.
I'm the last
of the vanishing Americans.

405
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:26,194
Oh, I feel so sorry
for you, Mr. Kidley.

406
00:23:26,299 --> 00:23:28,699
Oh, thanks, Mickey.
Nobody else cares.

407
00:23:28,801 --> 00:23:31,099
Why, even the hotel people
asked me to move.

408
00:23:31,204 --> 00:23:33,672
Afraid I might give
the hotel a bad name.

409
00:23:33,773 --> 00:23:36,640
Told me to go to some
other place and die.

410
00:23:36,742 --> 00:23:38,937
Oh, I wouldn't
be afraid of them.

411
00:23:39,045 --> 00:23:42,014
I'd do it right here
in this room,
if I wanted to.

412
00:23:42,114 --> 00:23:44,048
Oh, gee.
You're a nice girl, Mickey.

413
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:46,618
I like you...
and I like Henry too.

414
00:23:46,719 --> 00:23:49,085
You do?
Jeepers.

415
00:23:49,188 --> 00:23:51,088
Yes, sir?
Another glass.

416
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:53,090
Another glass,
Jeepers.
For you.

417
00:23:53,192 --> 00:23:56,491
Oh, thank you, sir.
Let's drink to Henry.
Munch?

418
00:23:56,596 --> 00:23:58,723
Munch.
Munch.

419
00:23:58,831 --> 00:24:01,459
[Telephone Rings]

420
00:24:01,567 --> 00:24:03,467
That couldn't be Pa,
could it?

421
00:24:03,569 --> 00:24:06,003
The Kidley suite.

422
00:24:06,105 --> 00:24:08,005
[Kidley]
Who is it?
It's the "Arko-may."

423
00:24:08,107 --> 00:24:10,302
Holy mackerel!
I forgot all about her.

424
00:24:10,409 --> 00:24:13,401
What does she want?
It's about
your nuptials, sir.

425
00:24:13,513 --> 00:24:15,413
She wants to know
if you're dressed.
Tell her no.

426
00:24:15,515 --> 00:24:18,882
Tell her anything.
Tell her I'm not dressed,
not even my socks.

427
00:24:18,985 --> 00:24:23,354
You see, Mrs. Marko,
Mr. Kidley is
a little delayed.

428
00:24:23,456 --> 00:24:26,152
No, not decayed, madam,
delayed.

429
00:24:26,259 --> 00:24:28,159
[Marko]
And I want him to be
ready for the ceremony!

430
00:24:28,261 --> 00:24:30,161
What'd she say?
What'd she say?

431
00:24:30,263 --> 00:24:32,163
She says you'd better
be ready darn soon, sir...

432
00:24:32,265 --> 00:24:34,563
and I didn't like
the way she said it.
Well, Jeepers...

433
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:36,567
Jeepers, do something.
Think of something.

434
00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:38,569
Yeah!
What's the matter?
What's the matter?

435
00:24:38,671 --> 00:24:40,866
She... Mrs. Marko,
she shoots her husbands.

436
00:24:40,973 --> 00:24:42,873
She pushes them
off mountains and...

437
00:24:42,975 --> 00:24:45,273
and I've got
to marry her at 3:30.

438
00:24:45,378 --> 00:24:48,040
But you don't have
to marry her, do you?

439
00:24:48,147 --> 00:24:50,707
I don't, huh?
She's the Olympic
pistol champion.

440
00:24:50,816 --> 00:24:52,716
I can't get out of this
any more than you can.

441
00:24:52,818 --> 00:24:54,718
I mean, we're
in the same fix.

442
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,913
Oh, why didn't you
let me stay in the water?

443
00:24:57,023 --> 00:24:58,923
I was just beginning
to do all right.

444
00:24:59,025 --> 00:25:02,222
All she wants
is my money.
She's my Smirnov.

445
00:25:02,328 --> 00:25:04,387
Hey, wait a minute.
There's an out.

446
00:25:04,497 --> 00:25:06,397
There's an out
for both of us.

447
00:25:06,499 --> 00:25:08,399
You mean we should
jump back into the...
No! Listen carefully.

448
00:25:08,501 --> 00:25:10,401
We only have
a few minutes.
Yeah?

449
00:25:10,503 --> 00:25:12,403
How would you
like to marry me?

450
00:25:12,505 --> 00:25:15,372
How would l... What?
You've had too much
of that spider juice, sir.

451
00:25:15,474 --> 00:25:17,567
No, I haven't.
But I can't marry you.

452
00:25:17,677 --> 00:25:19,577
Yes, you can.
Here, put this on.

453
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,579
It throws everybody
for a loss.

454
00:25:21,681 --> 00:25:23,581
It puts the prince
behind the eight ball...

455
00:25:23,683 --> 00:25:25,514
and the pistol champion
in the side pocket.

456
00:25:25,618 --> 00:25:28,416
But what about Henry?
Well, that's it.

457
00:25:28,521 --> 00:25:30,682
I can die in peace,
and as soon as I'm gone
you can marry Henry...

458
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,690
and I'll leave him
barrels of money.

459
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:34,692
He can buy
a thousand buses.

460
00:25:34,794 --> 00:25:37,262
Yeah, that's...
Oh, but I don't love you.

461
00:25:37,363 --> 00:25:39,888
I mean, I don't even
know you, well,
good, you know.

462
00:25:39,999 --> 00:25:41,899
I don't love you either.
That makes it perfect.

463
00:25:42,001 --> 00:25:43,901
But why should you
do all this for me?

464
00:25:44,003 --> 00:25:46,597
Well, in the first place,
I've never done anything
for anybody.

465
00:25:46,706 --> 00:25:49,004
In the second place,
it helps me too.

466
00:25:49,108 --> 00:25:51,702
And in the third place...
Oh, well, I don't know.

467
00:25:51,811 --> 00:25:54,780
But-But, you can't...
No buts. You leave
everything to me.

468
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,873
All right, I will.
And I'll leave
everything to you.

469
00:26:13,332 --> 00:26:15,232
Highness.

470
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,170
[Man]
Ah, gentlemen!

471
00:26:20,272 --> 00:26:25,835
Your Highness, I wouldn't
have missed your wedding
for the world.

472
00:26:25,945 --> 00:26:28,004
Gentlemen,
you all know Kretsky.

473
00:26:28,114 --> 00:26:30,674
There he stands,
an eloquent picture
of his mission.

474
00:26:30,783 --> 00:26:33,718
The bulge
in his right pocket:
My unpaid notes.

475
00:26:33,819 --> 00:26:36,947
In his left pocket:
My bad checks.

476
00:26:37,056 --> 00:26:39,183
The hollow in the middle
is Kretsky.

477
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:41,350
Your Highness
has saved me words.

478
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,792
Unless the bulge
in my left pocket...

479
00:26:43,896 --> 00:26:46,763
is made good immediately
after the ceremony...

480
00:26:46,866 --> 00:26:48,993
Your Highness will
have the opportunity...

481
00:26:49,101 --> 00:26:52,593
of entertaining the police
with his priceless humor.

482
00:26:52,705 --> 00:26:54,605
Kretsky,
I intensely dislike
you and your bloodhound...

Just one moment.
Will you pardon me.
Your Highness, pardon me.

There's a certain

She wants
to get married.
Well, uh...

I'm afraid they'll elope
unless we do something, sir.

00:36:11,663 --> 00:36:14,689
Go on, do it.
Go on.
Oh, no. That's kid stuff.

646
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,325
Aw, go on, Henry.
Just one little horse,
please.

647
00:36:17,436 --> 00:36:20,428
Well, all right.
Just once.
Yeah, yeah.

[Laughing]

652
00:36:29,548 --> 00:36:31,846
I love it.
Come on. Do it again, Henry.

[Mickey, Henry
Laughing]

655
00:36:36,455 --> 00:36:40,687
Look, Mama.
The moon out and everything,
and he makes like a horse.

656
00:36:42,294 --> 00:36:44,194
Oh!

657
00:36:44,296 --> 00:36:46,196
Oh, Mickey?
Oh, pardon me.

658
00:36:46,298 --> 00:36:48,198
I didn't mean to...
[Chuckles]

659
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,701
I just came out.
I thought it was just about
time for me to kick off.

660
00:36:51,803 --> 00:36:54,397
What?
I mean, turn in.
Go to bed.

661
00:36:54,506 --> 00:36:57,031
Oh.
[Laughs]
Good night, Mickey.

662
00:36:57,142 --> 00:36:59,474
Good night, Henry.
Good night!

663
00:36:59,578 --> 00:37:01,944
Oh, Mr. Kidley,
wait a minute.
I'm coming right in.

664
00:37:03,315 --> 00:37:05,442
Good night, Henry.
And I'll see you
in the morning.

665
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,518
Good night.
You'll see me
in the morn...

666
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:09,519
Hey, you!

667
00:37:09,621 --> 00:37:11,714
L-I'll tuck you in,
huh?
Oh, thank you.

668
00:37:11,823 --> 00:37:15,054
Oh, that's all right.
I want you to feel
nice and comfortable.

669
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,958
It's full of feathers.
Oh, yeah?

670
00:37:18,063 --> 00:37:19,928
Hey!

671
00:37:20,032 --> 00:37:23,524
Oh, Henry, doesn't
Mr. Kidley look cute
in his pajamas?

672
00:37:23,635 --> 00:37:27,162
Well, yeah, but...
He looks so cute.
[Laughs]

673
00:37:27,272 --> 00:37:29,740
Uh...

674
00:37:29,841 --> 00:37:31,741
Mr. Kidley,
we gotta have a talk.

675
00:37:31,843 --> 00:37:34,277
All right, Henry.
We'll talk in the morning.
I've had a hard day.

676
00:37:34,379 --> 00:37:36,870
Well, in the morning
won't do, Mr. Kidley.

677
00:37:36,982 --> 00:37:40,543
Well, what is it?
What is it?
Well, I ain't happy.

678
00:37:40,652 --> 00:37:42,552
Why, Henry,
just a minute ago
you were swell...

679
00:37:42,654 --> 00:37:44,554
when you were acting
like a horse.

680
00:37:44,656 --> 00:37:47,284
Well, I ain't the
beating-around-the-bush
kind of guy.

681
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:49,622
If I got anything
on my mind,
I spit it out.

682
00:37:49,728 --> 00:37:51,593
Now, Henry,
don't be that way.

683
00:37:51,697 --> 00:37:53,790
Mr. Kidley hasn't long
to be with us.

684
00:37:53,899 --> 00:37:55,799
[Whispering]
He hasn't long
to be with us.

685
00:37:55,901 --> 00:37:58,131
And it's our duty to see
that he's happy and...

686
00:37:58,236 --> 00:38:01,933
Happy? Well, what difference
does it make to you
whether he's happy or not?

687
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:05,271
[Mickey]
Well, after all, Henry,
I am Mrs. Kidley.

688
00:38:05,377 --> 00:38:08,972
And I always say that a
wife's place is in the home.
Listen!

689
00:38:09,081 --> 00:38:12,073
Oh, Henry, you don't have
to worry about me.

690
00:38:12,184 --> 00:38:14,175
Why, one of these mornings
you'll wake up and...

691
00:38:14,286 --> 00:38:17,221
Pfft. I'll be gone.

692
00:38:17,322 --> 00:38:21,383
Mr. Kidley,
I been watchin' you
mighty close here of late...

693
00:38:21,493 --> 00:38:25,429
and all I got to say
is that you ain't been
livin' up to your promise.

694
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:27,498
You ain't gettin'
any smaller.

695
00:38:32,604 --> 00:38:35,630
[Humming]

696
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:42,579
[Mumbling]
Uh, who's there?

697
00:38:42,681 --> 00:38:45,149
[Ingleborg Humming,
Knocking]
Oh, come in.

698
00:38:47,018 --> 00:38:50,385
Good morning!
Good morning!

699
00:38:50,489 --> 00:38:53,947
Well, Mama Ingleborg
has fixed the breakfast
herself.

700
00:38:54,059 --> 00:38:55,959
Oh, that's fine.
Hey, breakfast!

701
00:38:56,061 --> 00:38:58,996
Yes, a very
special breakfast...

702
00:38:59,097 --> 00:39:01,657
for our two little
dummelflumphes.
[Laughs]

703
00:39:01,767 --> 00:39:04,970
Well, that's very nice
of Mama, Mr. Ingleborg.

704
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:05,197
Well, that's very nice
of Mama, Mr. Ingleborg.

705
00:39:05,303 --> 00:39:08,602
Yes, it sure is!
Ah!

706
00:39:13,445 --> 00:39:17,404
What sticks in my craw is,
everything he says
is so wonderful...

707
00:39:17,516 --> 00:39:20,644
but everything I say it's,
"Oh, Henry, oh, Henry,
oh, Henry."

708
00:39:20,752 --> 00:39:24,188
Oh!
Now, Henry, don't talk
that way about Mr. Kidley.

709
00:39:24,289 --> 00:39:27,053
Oh, shucks.
[Crashes]

710
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:29,787
Look! He's getting
that flower just for me.
Risking his life.

711
00:39:29,895 --> 00:39:31,795
Oh!

712
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:41,166
I got it!

713
00:39:41,273 --> 00:39:43,173
[Mickey]
Careful! Careful!

714
00:39:43,275 --> 00:39:45,709
[Henry]
Oh, that ain't nothin'.

715
00:39:45,811 --> 00:39:48,678
I'd take a chance
at breakin' my neck, too,
if I knew I was gonna die.

716
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,941
Gee, thanks.

717
00:39:51,049 --> 00:39:53,244
Aw.

718
00:39:53,351 --> 00:39:56,787
Well, there it is.
Oh, thanks,
Mr. Kidley.

719
00:39:56,888 --> 00:39:59,880
For you.
In the words of the poet,
"You are like a flower."

720
00:39:59,991 --> 00:40:02,357
Oh, Mr. Kidley,
that's so sweet.

721
00:40:02,461 --> 00:40:05,692
That's just like
in the movies.
Yeah.

722
00:40:05,797 --> 00:40:07,697
Well, it was original
with me at the moment.

723
00:40:07,799 --> 00:40:10,529
Let me help you, Mr. Kidley.
You must be a little tired.

724
00:40:10,635 --> 00:40:13,365
Let's sit down
and rest a minute, huh?
Yeah.

725
00:40:13,472 --> 00:40:15,372
Huh?
Huh-uh.

726
00:40:17,042 --> 00:40:19,909
I guess I'll
run along to the hotel.
You and Henry want to be alone.

727
00:40:20,011 --> 00:40:23,378
The minute you do, he'll
just start whittling.
Oh, that's fine talk.

728
00:40:23,482 --> 00:40:25,677
A fella can whittle
and still be in love,
I guess.

729
00:40:25,784 --> 00:40:29,015
He don't have
to go around shouting
that poetry muck all day.

730
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,850
Oh, Henry,
that's where you're wrong.
Women are romantic, sentimental.

731
00:40:31,957 --> 00:40:34,517
It's up to us men
to humor 'em...
say pretty things.

732
00:40:34,626 --> 00:40:36,560
Oh, I suppose you could
give me a lesson.

733
00:40:36,661 --> 00:40:38,561
Oh, I bet you'd
be good at it too.

734
00:40:38,663 --> 00:40:40,563
Well, I have kind of
been around.

735
00:40:40,665 --> 00:40:42,565
Frankly, Henry,
I think you could
use a few lessons.

736
00:40:42,667 --> 00:40:44,567
For instance?
Well, for a starter...

737
00:40:44,669 --> 00:40:46,830
Supposing you were going
to take a girl in your arms.
Uh-huh.

738
00:40:46,938 --> 00:40:49,031
Now you hold her
tenderly... gently.

739
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,335
Yeah, Henry,
you handle me
as if I was a bus.

740
00:40:51,443 --> 00:40:53,673
Oh, bosh!
Now, watch, Henry.

741
00:40:53,778 --> 00:40:57,305
Now, supposing I'm you.
You hold her like this,
and then you kiss her.

742
00:40:57,415 --> 00:40:59,280
Oh.

743
00:41:00,819 --> 00:41:02,719
[Laughs]
You see, Henry?

744
00:41:02,821 --> 00:41:05,051
Uh-uh. No.
[Mickey]
No?

745
00:41:05,156 --> 00:41:08,148
No? Well, show him
again, Mr. Kidley.
All right.

746
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:11,559
Wait a minute.
Here. Thank you.
[Laughs]

747
00:41:11,663 --> 00:41:13,858
Ooh!
Oh, pardon me.

748
00:41:18,703 --> 00:41:21,331
[Chuckles]

749
00:41:21,439 --> 00:41:24,738
There.
Now you do it, Henry.
I'll sit here and watch.

750
00:41:24,843 --> 00:41:29,280
No, sir. I don't have
to kiss my girl in front
of a whole crowd of people.

751
00:41:29,381 --> 00:41:31,679
Well, it's only
Mr. Kidley, Henry.
No.

752
00:41:31,783 --> 00:41:34,752
Aw, come on.
Please?
Oh, all right.

753
00:41:38,189 --> 00:41:41,784
Uh-uh.
Well, I can't
get started.

754
00:41:41,893 --> 00:41:44,885
Maybe you haven't
turned on your ignition.
Oh!

755
00:41:47,499 --> 00:41:50,059
There!
No, that's not it,
Henry.

756
00:41:50,168 --> 00:41:52,693
Would you show him again,
please, Mr. Kidley?
Oh, of course.

757
00:41:52,804 --> 00:41:54,704
Anything at all.
Here. Hold that.
Just a moment.

758
00:41:57,842 --> 00:42:00,504
Any time you
get the idea,
Henry, just cut in.

759
00:42:02,047 --> 00:42:05,312
Well, I don't see
that he's doin' anything
that I didn't do.

760
00:42:05,417 --> 00:42:08,909
Well, it's just
something or other
that I can't explain, Henry.

761
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:12,080
When he does it,
it's like a bunch
of trained wildcats...

762
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:15,455
but when you do it,
it's more like wild mice.

763
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,460
Yeah.
Oh, well,
I watched him close...

764
00:42:17,562 --> 00:42:19,587
and I did everything
that he did...

765
00:42:19,698 --> 00:42:24,260
and I'll bet you
if you had your eyes closed
you couldn't tell us apart.

766
00:42:24,369 --> 00:42:26,428
All right, Henry.
I'll prove it to you.

767
00:42:26,538 --> 00:42:28,438
Somebody give me
a hankie.
You got a hankie?

768
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,440
Oh, yes,
I have one here.

769
00:42:30,542 --> 00:42:33,375
No! Her, her, her!

770
00:42:33,478 --> 00:42:35,378
Oh, pardon me.
Pardon me.

771
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,380
All right, now I'll
tie this tight.

772
00:42:37,482 --> 00:42:39,814
Now you come around
in front, Mr. Kidley.
All right.

773
00:42:39,918 --> 00:42:41,909
And the both of you
step back now.

774
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,920
And then you sneak up
one at a time and kiss me...

775
00:42:44,022 --> 00:42:45,922
and I'll tell you
just who it is.

776
00:42:46,024 --> 00:42:49,323
All right, step back.
Go on, go on.

777
00:42:54,132 --> 00:42:56,032
Well, don't go away.

778
00:42:56,134 --> 00:42:58,034
Okay. Now, I'll count
up to ten...

779
00:42:58,136 --> 00:43:00,036
and then one of you
come up and kiss me.

780
00:43:00,138 --> 00:43:05,201
All right.
One, two, three...

781
00:43:06,311 --> 00:43:08,176
four...

782
00:43:08,279 --> 00:43:10,406
five...

783
00:43:10,515 --> 00:43:14,383
six, seven, eight...

784
00:43:14,486 --> 00:43:16,454
nine, ten.

785
00:43:16,554 --> 00:43:20,217
You ready?
Well, come on.

786
00:43:23,461 --> 00:43:25,361
That's Henry.

787
00:43:27,265 --> 00:43:30,063
That's Mr. Kidley.
[Laughs]

788
00:43:30,168 --> 00:43:33,228
Ready again.

789
00:43:33,338 --> 00:43:35,101
That's Henry.

790
00:43:37,075 --> 00:43:38,975
That's Mr. Kidley.

791
00:43:39,077 --> 00:43:41,739
[Laughs]

792
00:43:41,846 --> 00:43:45,304
That's Henry, still handling
me like I was a bus.
[Clicks Tongue]

793
00:43:48,853 --> 00:43:50,912
Why, Henry, how dare you
take your shirt off.

794
00:43:51,022 --> 00:43:52,922
I'm surprised, l...

795
00:43:56,995 --> 00:44:02,865
Mr. Kidley!
Henry!

796
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:17,946
Yes, sir.
I can leave
immediately, sir.

797
00:44:18,049 --> 00:44:20,950
Just a minute, sir.
I'll write it down.

798
00:44:22,387 --> 00:44:24,981
"Ingleborg Haus...

799
00:44:27,625 --> 00:44:29,786
Ingleborg."

800
00:44:29,894 --> 00:44:32,192
I've got it, sir.

801
00:44:32,297 --> 00:44:34,697
Forgive the liberty,
sir, but, uh...

802
00:44:34,799 --> 00:44:37,063
how is everything?

803
00:44:37,168 --> 00:44:39,102
Oh?

804
00:44:39,204 --> 00:44:41,502
Oh?

805

968
00:57:45,789 --> 00:57:48,451
You're all taken care of
in my will.
How so?

969
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:53,189
Henry, I'm not gonna waste a lot
of time telling you how much
I admire you, because I don't.

970
00:57:53,297 --> 00:57:56,698
But I'm gonna leave you
enough money to choke a horse,
and I hope it does choke ya.

971
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,735
[Dinnerware Clanks]
Mr. Kidley, I resent that!

972
00:57:59,837 --> 00:58:03,466
We are now where we started,
still with egg over my face.

973
00:58:03,574 --> 00:58:05,974
I know.
I'm wiping that off
in paragraph three.

974
00:58:06,076 --> 00:58:09,534
Marriage with you is
a business proposition,
and I've ruined your business.

975
00:58:09,647 --> 00:58:14,710
So I'm prepared to marry you.
I mean, [Chuckles]
Pay you off in full.

976
00:58:14,818 --> 00:58:19,517
Mr. Kidley, Prince Alexis
Cassandro Michael Smirnov
thanks you.

977
00:58:22,693 --> 00:58:26,527
I do not wish to talk like
a peasant, but there is
something that I must know.

978
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:29,497
Tell me, how soon do you
expect to go pfft?

979
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:32,967
Poor Mr. Kidley's only 18
days left. Haven't you,
poor Mr. Kidley?

980
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:35,402
Yes, any time now.
It's...
Good.
Good.

981
00:58:35,506 --> 00:58:37,565
What do you mean,
"good"?

982
00:58:37,675 --> 00:58:41,236
There's a little thing known
as breach of promise. You won't
mind if I send my lawyers?

983
00:58:41,345 --> 00:58:44,280
That won't be necessary.
I've taken care of that
in paragraph six.

984
00:58:44,381 --> 00:58:47,646
You go out and buy yourself
a nice solid-gold
shooting gallery.

985
00:58:47,751 --> 00:58:51,152
Oh, John!
I'm sentimentally touched.

986
00:58:51,255 --> 00:58:54,349
I'll see that they put flowers
on you every Father's Day.
[Chuckling] Yes, l...

987
00:58:54,458 --> 00:58:57,052
She probably gets 'em
wholesale.
What I want to know is...

988
00:58:57,161 --> 00:59:01,325
Shut up, Henry. Mr. Kidley,
I guess this just about
takes care of everything.

989
00:59:01,432 --> 00:59:04,162
Yes.
Folks, let's get out of here and
leave the honeymooners alone.

990
00:59:04,268 --> 00:59:06,600
Come on, Henry.
Well, I'm one
of the honeymooners!

991
00:59:06,704 --> 00:59:09,935
Oh, shut up
and get outta here!
All of my clothes are...

992
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:11,940
Oh.

993
00:59:12,042 --> 00:59:16,138
Mr. Kidley... you have
promised me to die.

994
00:59:16,246 --> 00:59:20,615
I am warning you that
I will be around personally
to see that you do it.

995
00:59:20,718 --> 00:59:22,845
[Weak Chuckle]

996
00:59:22,953 --> 00:59:24,853
[Clicks Heels]

997
00:59:28,025 --> 00:59:29,993
Henry...

998
00:59:30,094 --> 00:59:32,153
I may call you Henry,
mayn't I?

999
00:59:32,262 --> 00:59:35,527
Yes, ma'am, and I'll
call you Mrs. Marko.

1000
00:59:35,633 --> 00:59:38,033
Well, Henry,
when Mr. Kidley...

1001
00:59:38,135 --> 00:59:42,196
I mean, when it happens,
you'll come into quite a
tidy sum, won't you, Henry?

1002
00:59:42,306 --> 00:59:44,331
Mm... Yes, ma'am,
I guess I will.

1003
00:59:44,441 --> 00:59:49,071
Dear Henry,
I want you and Mrs. Kidley
to be very happy.

1004
00:59:49,179 --> 00:59:51,807
If things don't work out,
it may make it easier
for you to know...

1005
00:59:51,915 --> 00:59:55,146
that there'll always be
someone waiting for you.

1006
00:59:55,252 --> 00:59:57,482
There will?

1007
00:59:57,588 --> 01:00:01,581
Oh.
You're a very
attractive man, Henry.

1008
01:00:01,692 --> 01:00:04,092
I mustn't say any more
than that right now.

1009
01:00:04,194 --> 01:00:07,254
Well, you're kind of pretty
yourself, Mrs. Marko.
[Chuckles]

1010
01:00:07,364 --> 01:00:09,696
That's sweet of you.

1011
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:13,634
Henry, if you don't mind
my suggesting it,
I could have my lawyers...

1012
01:00:13,737 --> 01:00:16,433
they're very good...
go over Mr. Kidley's will.

1013
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:18,701
Just watching out
for your interests.

1014
01:00:18,809 --> 01:00:23,712
Well, doggone it, ma'am...
and me just meetin' ya...
that sure is kind.

1015
01:00:23,814 --> 01:00:25,714
Mighty kind.

1016
01:00:27,584 --> 01:00:30,314
?? [Whistling]

1017
01:00:30,421 --> 01:00:32,753
?? [Joins In]
Good morning, ma'am.
Good morning, sir.

1018
01:00:32,856 --> 01:00:34,756
[Together]
Good morning, Jeepers.

1019
01:00:34,858 --> 01:00:37,850
Your mail, sir,
from Bad Gaswasser.
Just throw it away.

1020
01:00:37,961 --> 01:00:40,054
Oh, but, sir,
there may be
something important.

1021
01:00:40,164 --> 01:00:42,632
Nothing is important,
Jeepers, but living.

1022
01:00:42,733 --> 01:00:46,396
That's the spirit, sir.
I noticed a change in you
the moment I arrived.

1023
01:00:46,503 --> 01:00:48,767
Yes, you can thank
Mickey for that.
Thank you, Mickey...

1024
01:00:48,872 --> 01:00:51,272
Uh, Mrs. Kidley.
Okay, Jeepers.

1025
01:00:51,375 --> 01:00:54,867
Yes, sir, if I may say so,
you're bubbling over, sir...
just bubbling over.

1026
01:00:54,978 --> 01:00:57,208
That's the coffee,
Jeepers.
Oh.

1027
01:00:57,314 --> 01:01:00,579
Uh, Jeepers, will you order
some more heavy cream?

1028
01:01:01,685 --> 01:01:04,449
Very good, sir.

1029
01:01:04,555 --> 01:01:08,389
? One day in springtime
their love dream came true ??

1030
01:01:08,492 --> 01:01:13,623
Mr. Kidley, isn't there
somethin' that you get
a great big kick out of doin'?

1031
01:01:13,731 --> 01:01:17,258
I mean, there's not much time
before you D-l-E.

1032
01:01:19,403 --> 01:01:23,499
And I just want you to
remember these last few days
as long as you live.

1033
01:01:23,607 --> 01:01:26,303
Well, there's one...
Let's see...

1034
01:01:26,410 --> 01:01:29,311
Do you mind if I write on this?
It's from that druggist.
What druggist?

1035
01:01:29,413 --> 01:01:31,313
You know,
in Bad Gaswasser.

1036
01:01:31,415 --> 01:01:34,407
He probably wants
to sell me something.
"Kipper, a dog."

1037
01:01:34,518 --> 01:01:37,316
Yeah, yeah. He wants
to sell you a dog.
[Chuckles]

1038
01:01:37,421 --> 01:01:41,721
Say, that's
a pretty hairdo.
Thank you.

1039
01:01:41,825 --> 01:01:46,421
Well, we're going to
figure out right now what
to do with your last 18 days.

1040
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:49,931
Uh... Have you ever
seen the Sphinx?
No. Is it good?

1041
01:01:50,033 --> 01:01:53,025
Well, we're
gonna see it.
We? Henry too?

1042
01:01:53,137 --> 01:01:58,074
No, we don't want him around
our Sphinx. He'll only
start whittlin' on it.

1043
01:01:58,175 --> 01:02:00,234
Sphinx. One day.

1044
01:02:01,478 --> 01:02:03,605
What's he
so sorry about?

1045
01:02:03,714 --> 01:02:07,309
What's who what?
This druggist.
He sure is sorry.

1046
01:02:07,417 --> 01:02:10,284
"Had your acidity test
mixed with a dog's...
Kipper."

1047
01:02:10,387 --> 01:02:14,824
Say, I know where we could spend
about six days. There must be
a bicycle race around here.

1048
01:02:14,925 --> 01:02:17,052
Mr. Kidley, listen.
Huh?

1049
01:02:17,161 --> 01:02:21,825
Listen. "Kipper, whose name
sounds not unlike your own"...

1050
01:02:21,932 --> 01:02:26,733
Mr. Kidley, Kipper's a dog.
You're not.

1051
01:02:26,837 --> 01:02:29,237
What?
Well, I mean, it...

1052
01:02:29,339 --> 01:02:31,398
It says so right here.

1053
01:02:31,508 --> 01:02:33,976
Y-Y-You got all mixed up
with Kipper.
Kippers?

1054
01:02:34,077 --> 01:02:37,137
[Stammering]
Listen, listen.

1055
01:02:37,247 --> 01:02:40,808
"I am happy to report
that both you and the dog
are entirely normal."

1056
01:02:40,918 --> 01:02:43,113
Mm-hmm.
Normal.

1057
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:45,780
Oh. Well, you're both
all right!

1058
01:02:45,889 --> 01:02:47,880
Oh, well, sure. I wouldn't want
to buy a dog...
Yeah.

1059
01:02:47,991 --> 01:02:50,118
Wha... Wha... Wha...

1060
01:02:50,227 --> 01:02:53,424
"I am happy to report
that both you and the dog
are entirely normal.

1061
01:02:53,530 --> 01:02:55,930
It's wonderful!
You're not gonna die!
You're both all right."

1062
01:02:56,033 --> 01:02:59,935
You're gonna live!
Hooray! It's wonderful!
It's great! That's marvel...

1063
01:03:00,037 --> 01:03:02,096
Or is it?
Of course it is.

1064
01:03:02,206 --> 01:03:05,607
I know, but that gang...
I promised them
I was gonna kick off.

1065
01:03:05,709 --> 01:03:09,201
They're gonna be sore
about this.
Tell 'em you were only foolin'.

1066
01:03:09,313 --> 01:03:12,214
Fooling with
an Olympic pistol champion
and a duelist?

1067
01:03:12,316 --> 01:03:16,480
If I don't die on time
something serious is liable
to happen to me.

1068
01:03:16,587 --> 01:03:20,421
L...
Here. Nobody will know anything
happened; what it's all about.

1069
01:03:20,524 --> 01:03:22,958
We won't tell anybody
a thing.

1070
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:26,291
Oh, Mr. Kidley, we...
Now we're really married.

1071
01:03:26,396 --> 01:03:29,263
I mean, just like
Ma and Pa and...

1072
01:03:29,366 --> 01:03:32,267
and Mrs. Marko and...
well, everybody.

1073
01:03:32,369 --> 01:03:34,735
Oh, yeah!
Y... Oh.

1074
01:03:34,838 --> 01:03:37,807
Oh, what about Henry?
Oh, yeah, Henry.

1075
01:03:37,908 --> 01:03:40,604
Well... Well, don't worry
about him. I'll...
I'll take care of him.

1076
01:03:40,711 --> 01:03:42,611
Oh!

1077
01:04:05,235 --> 01:04:07,931
?? [Whistling]

1078
01:04:08,038 --> 01:04:09,938
Mr. Kidley.
Hello, Henry.

1079
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:13,339
Could I speak to you
for a moment, please?
Sure. What's on your mind?

1080
01:04:13,443 --> 01:04:17,880
Well, it's about
Mickey and me too.
I ain't happy again.

1081
01:04:17,981 --> 01:04:23,317
What seems to be the trouble?
I know you don't like me
and I can't blame you for it.

1082
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:25,980
But I like you.
Henry, I like you!

1083
01:04:26,089 --> 01:04:31,550
Let me finish, Mr. Kidley.
Here you are doin'
everything for me, and...

1084
01:04:31,662 --> 01:04:35,496
Well, I want you to know
you're one of the finest men
I ever met up with.

1085
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:37,658
[Voice Cracking]
Well, Henry, I'm a...

1086
01:04:37,768 --> 01:04:40,566
Heh!
I mean, I'm not really
like you say at all.

1087
01:04:40,671 --> 01:04:43,435
If you only knew me.
I'd double-cross my own...

1088
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:46,373
Mr. Kidley,
I won't let you say a word
again' yourself.

1089
01:04:46,476 --> 01:04:49,934
I guess I know a man
when I see one.

1090
01:04:50,047 --> 01:04:53,414
I know I'm nothing but
a poor bus driver and...

1091
01:04:53,517 --> 01:04:56,384
Well, you could cut me out
with Mickey just like that...
[Snaps Fingers]

1092
01:04:56,486 --> 01:05:01,116
- If you wanted to.
- Well, I don't know, Henry.

1093
01:05:01,224 --> 01:05:04,523
Things are different now.
I mean, I just found out...

1094
01:05:04,628 --> 01:05:08,689
Shucks, Mr. Kidley.
You've done everything
to make me and Mickey happy...

1095
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:12,496
and, well,
I guess you know
how I feel about her.

1096
01:05:12,602 --> 01:05:15,594
I guess you know
how I feel about you too.

1097
01:05:15,706 --> 01:05:18,402
Well, that's all.
I just had to let it out.

1098
01:05:18,508 --> 01:05:21,807
Except, I'd like to
shake your hand and
tell you how sorry I am...

1099
01:05:21,912 --> 01:05:25,939
for bein' such a fool
suspicionin' you.

1100
01:05:26,049 --> 01:05:28,415
Well, don't worry about
a thing. You're okay.

1101
01:05:28,518 --> 01:05:30,418
Thanks, Mr. Kidley.

1102
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:59,381
Here, boy. I want you to
take this to Mr. Henry Munch.

1103
01:06:03,553 --> 01:06:05,612
Do you know him?
Yes, ma'am.

1104
01:06:05,722 --> 01:06:09,123
All right. Here is
something for you.
Thank you.

1105
01:06:09,226 --> 01:06:11,126
[Knocking]

1106
01:06:12,929 --> 01:06:17,696
Hello, Mickey.
Oh, Mr. Kidley. I was
just going to find you.

1107
01:06:17,801 --> 01:06:20,065
Uh, look, Mickey,
I just sent...

1108
01:06:20,170 --> 01:06:22,570
I've been thinking
this whole thing over.

1109
01:06:22,672 --> 01:06:25,470
I mean,
now that I'm gonna live
and everything, l...

1110
01:06:25,575 --> 01:06:29,477
It kinda changes the whole
setup. It kinda puts
a different angle on it.

1111
01:06:29,579 --> 01:06:31,638
I don't know
what you mean.

1112
01:06:31,748 --> 01:06:36,151
Well, after all, we hardly
knew each other, and this
whole thing was a put-up job.

1113
01:06:36,253 --> 01:06:38,483
Marriage is a serious
sort of thing.

1114
01:06:38,588 --> 01:06:42,991
You mean you... you don't
want to be married to me,
Mr. Kidley?

1115
01:06:43,093 --> 01:06:47,496
Well, it was a lot of fun
and everything, but for it to be
for the rest of our lives, l...

1116
01:06:47,597 --> 01:06:51,761
- You mean you don't love me?
- Well, frankly, Mickey,
I guess I don't.

1117
01:06:51,868 --> 01:06:53,495
Oh.

1118
01:06:53,603 --> 01:06:56,401
Naturally, I'll give you
the divorce.

1119
01:06:57,774 --> 01:06:59,799
You won't have any trouble.

1120
01:06:59,910 --> 01:07:03,004
And after everything's set,
you must go back to Henry.

1121
01:07:04,314 --> 01:07:06,714
Well, it...
[Laughs]

1122
01:07:06,817 --> 01:07:09,650
It was nice being married
to you, Mr. Kidley...

1123
01:07:09,753 --> 01:07:11,812
even if we weren't, really.

1124
01:07:11,922 --> 01:07:14,186
Yeah, it was a lot of fun.

1125
01:07:15,292 --> 01:07:18,056
It's kind of a surprise.
L...

1126
01:07:18,161 --> 01:07:21,392
I mean, l-I,
I thought it was gonna...

1127
01:07:21,498 --> 01:07:25,229
Well, l... I guess
that's the way things
are with things, huh?

1128
01:07:25,335 --> 01:07:28,361
Oh, sure.
Things have a way of always
turning out right, Mickey.

1129
01:07:28,472 --> 01:07:30,372
Yeah.

1130
01:07:30,474 --> 01:07:32,874
Well...
I'll be seeing you.

1131
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:42,650
[Faintly]
L...

1132
01:07:43,753 --> 01:07:45,653
[Sobbing]

1133
01:08:19,022 --> 01:08:22,082
[Smirnov]
Kretsky...
I have been double-crossed.

1134
01:08:22,192 --> 01:08:24,888
This dog man,
he is without honor.

1135
01:08:24,995 --> 01:08:28,396
He will be
walking the streets alive,
breathing the air...

1136
01:08:28,498 --> 01:08:31,695
listening to the birds,
going to the opera,
the movies.

1137
01:08:31,801 --> 01:08:35,202
While l...
What will I be doing
all that time?

1138
01:08:35,305 --> 01:08:39,002
Well, unless
you do something,
starting tomorrow...

1139
01:08:39,109 --> 01:08:42,169
Your Highness
will be rotting in jail.
Yeah, heh...

1140
01:08:45,515 --> 01:08:47,574
But what is there
to do?

1141
01:08:47,684 --> 01:08:50,676
What is there to do?

1142
01:08:50,787 --> 01:08:53,221
My friend,
there is only one thing.

1143
01:08:56,193 --> 01:08:59,356
Kretsky...
you are even a bigger stinker
than I think.

1144
01:08:59,462 --> 01:09:02,124
[Laughs]
Yeah.

1145
01:09:02,232 --> 01:09:04,393
Yes, but that
is all very fine.

1146
01:09:04,501 --> 01:09:07,197
But what good is it for me
to make him go pfft...

1147
01:09:07,304 --> 01:09:10,796
if to me they are going...
[Choking Sounds]

1148
01:09:10,907 --> 01:09:13,501
Your Highness,
you amaze me.

1149
01:09:13,610 --> 01:09:18,274
It's all very simple.
You make it look like
an affair of honor.

1150
01:09:18,381 --> 01:09:20,645
It will not be
your first duel.

1151
01:09:22,085 --> 01:09:23,985
Kretsky...

1152
01:09:25,589 --> 01:09:28,057
Kidley,
he is in the bag.

1153
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:32,319
Crepe suzette?
Yeah, I guess so.

1154
01:09:32,429 --> 01:09:34,329
Merci.

1155
01:09:36,433 --> 01:09:38,333
Oh, Mickey.

1156
01:09:38,435 --> 01:09:41,632
Oh, you're... you're going.
I mean, those are your bags?

1157
01:09:41,738 --> 01:09:44,935
Yes. They're my bags.

1158
01:09:46,443 --> 01:09:49,674
Well... good-bye,
Mr. Kidley.

1159
01:09:49,779 --> 01:09:52,543
Well, you're really going.
Well, good-bye.

1160
01:09:52,649 --> 01:09:55,049
L-I'll be thinking
a lot about you.

1161
01:09:55,151 --> 01:09:57,551
I'll be thinking about
you too, Mr. Kidley.

1162
01:09:57,654 --> 01:10:01,317
Mr. Kidley.

1163
01:10:01,424 --> 01:10:05,952
You have tricked us.
Oh, this. Smirnov, I didn't
know myself. This is all...

1164
01:10:06,062 --> 01:10:09,429
That's right. Until yesterday,
he thought he was a dog.

1165
01:10:09,532 --> 01:10:11,796
Really?
This is wasting time.

1166
01:10:11,901 --> 01:10:16,668
Yes. Mr. Kidley,
I do not like your face.

1167
01:10:16,773 --> 01:10:19,139
Yeah, well,
if you had a face,
I wouldn't like it either.

1168
01:10:19,242 --> 01:10:21,301
That is an insult,
yes?
Yes!

1169
01:10:21,411 --> 01:10:24,574
All right. Mr. Kidley,
I challenge you...
Now, wait a minute!

1170
01:10:24,681 --> 01:10:29,709
I apologize. And I also
apologize for that poke
I gave you after the wedding.

1171
01:10:29,819 --> 01:10:31,844
What are you
apologizing for?
Don't take that from him.

1172
01:10:31,955 --> 01:10:34,480
He's trying to pick a fight
with me. He wants to
shoot me full of holes.

1173
01:10:34,591 --> 01:10:37,526
Oh! Well, well, don't
get mad at him. Smile.
Huh!

1174
01:10:37,627 --> 01:10:39,686
[Whispering]
Something physical.
Ah.

1175
01:10:41,398 --> 01:10:45,198
Mr. Kidley, if I should
take this pigeonette...

1176
01:10:45,302 --> 01:10:48,100
and push it in your face,
what will you do?

1177
01:10:48,204 --> 01:10:50,832
Why, I'd get so mad,
I'd probably...
How mad?

1178
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:54,307
Uh, well, sorta mad.
Not very!

1179
01:10:54,411 --> 01:10:57,073
No, I'd be more hurt
than anything else.

1180
01:10:57,180 --> 01:11:00,240
I'd probably go away
and never speak to you again.
[Poultry Clanks Plate]

1181
01:11:02,519 --> 01:11:04,510
[Inaudible Whispering]
Ah.

1182
01:11:09,559 --> 01:11:12,027
[Chuckles]

1183
01:11:13,797 --> 01:11:16,197
Ouch!

1184
01:11:24,474 --> 01:11:26,840
Why, you...

1185
01:11:26,943 --> 01:11:28,843
[Nervous Laughing]

1186
01:11:30,013 --> 01:11:32,948
There.
How do you like that?

1187
01:11:33,049 --> 01:11:36,985
- Not bad. I like it.
- Yeah, that's very cute.
Do it to me, Mr. Smirnov.

1188
01:11:37,087 --> 01:11:38,987
[Both Laughing]

1189
01:11:40,290 --> 01:11:42,622
Are they wearing this type
this year? Ah... l...

1190
01:11:44,194 --> 01:11:46,594
Why, you,
I oughta push in your...
Push in my what?

1191
01:11:46,696 --> 01:11:50,359
What?
Oh, you can't make him mad,
no matter what you do.

1192
01:11:51,468 --> 01:11:53,368
See?
[Nervous Giggle]

1193
01:11:53,470 --> 01:11:55,370
Uh...

1194
01:11:58,108 --> 01:12:00,008
Very good natured.

1195
01:12:00,110 --> 01:12:02,010
[Both Laugh]

1196
01:12:06,149 --> 01:12:08,083
See?
Nothing bothers him.

1197
01:12:09,819 --> 01:12:11,719
Does it?
No.

1198
01:12:13,723 --> 01:12:15,953
All right, Mickey.
I think we sold him.

1199
01:12:16,059 --> 01:12:17,959
Okay.
All right.

1200
01:12:18,061 --> 01:12:20,154
Oh.
[Chuckles]

1201
01:12:20,263 --> 01:12:22,322
This time I think up
something for myself.

1202
01:12:22,432 --> 01:12:25,094
Your dessert, monsieur.
Crepe suzette.

1203
01:12:27,670 --> 01:12:30,969
Mrs. Kidley,
I do not like your shoes...

1204
01:12:31,074 --> 01:12:33,702
I do not like
your dress...

1205
01:12:33,810 --> 01:12:36,210
and I do not like
your hat.

1206
01:12:38,014 --> 01:12:40,778
Oh! My new hat!
How do you like that,
Mr. Kidley?

1207
01:12:40,884 --> 01:12:43,682
Why you, l...
Let it go!

1208
01:12:43,787 --> 01:12:46,187
Let it go? Just a minute!
[Waiter]
This gentleman here!

1209
01:12:46,289 --> 01:12:48,689
Now perhaps, uh?
Your Highness,
you're a cutie.

1210
01:12:52,362 --> 01:12:55,991
[Crowd Exclaiming]
Everybody is a witness!
I have been insulted!

1211
01:12:56,099 --> 01:12:59,330
Oh, no! You haven't been
insulted yet. You have to
be good natured too.

1212
01:12:59,436 --> 01:13:02,166
Coffee...

1213
01:13:02,272 --> 01:13:04,172
cream...

1214
01:13:05,742 --> 01:13:08,210
and asparagus
and peas.

1215
01:13:08,311 --> 01:13:10,711
Now you have been
insulted.

1216
01:13:10,814 --> 01:13:14,443
Oh, you did it for me!
That proves it:
You do love me.

1217
01:13:14,551 --> 01:13:18,544
Sure I do, Mickey.
But what's the difference now?
Now, listen, Smirnov...

1218
01:13:18,655 --> 01:13:22,421
[Mickey] We didn't mean it.
We didn't mean to throw
all those things on you.

1219
01:13:22,525 --> 01:13:25,494
Mr. Kidley, my seconds
will call on you.

1220
01:13:25,595 --> 01:13:28,120
We meet at dawn
at the Three Dead Oaks.

1221
01:13:28,231 --> 01:13:31,325
I'm sure I'll never
find the place.
We will take you there.

1222
01:13:31,434 --> 01:13:33,334
[Clicks Heels]

1223
01:13:36,172 --> 01:13:38,436
Did he say "Dead Oaks"?

1224
01:13:39,542 --> 01:13:41,442
Dead Oaks.

1225
01:14:03,933 --> 01:14:05,833
Mr. Kidley.
Yes?

1226
01:14:05,935 --> 01:14:08,335
Please to stand up at
that end of the field.
That end?

1227
01:14:08,438 --> 01:14:12,397
His Highness does not like to
shoot with the sun in his eyes.
Oh, that's all ri...

1228
01:14:12,509 --> 01:14:15,069
How do you like that?
That guy Smirnov kills me.

1229
01:14:15,178 --> 01:14:17,669
You said it.

1230
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:21,876
He's supposed to be my second.
He's supposed to be on my side,
isn't he?
Pistols.

1231
01:14:21,985 --> 01:14:25,182
Oh, those are the...
Heh-heh!
This way, sir.

1232
01:14:28,091 --> 01:14:30,958
He will be ready soon.
Don't hurry him.

1233
01:14:35,164 --> 01:14:37,758
Very good.

1234
01:14:37,867 --> 01:14:41,530
Reload, please.
Only this time with
a little more umph!

1235
01:14:43,172 --> 01:14:45,072
Come.

1236
01:14:51,948 --> 01:14:55,645
What are you doin' now?
I'm reloading
the pistols.

1237
01:14:55,752 --> 01:14:59,779
With real bullets?
Yes, madam.
The kind that spread.

1238
01:14:59,889 --> 01:15:01,789
L...

1239
01:15:03,359 --> 01:15:06,294
Hey.

1240
01:15:06,396 --> 01:15:10,264
Jeepers, stop shaking.
I don't know why
you worry about this.

1241
01:15:10,366 --> 01:15:14,234
I'm in great condition. You
know that. This kind of a thing
wouldn't bother me a second.

1242
01:15:14,337 --> 01:15:17,135
I just... Jeepers, l...

1243
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:19,299
Ivan, massage
the arm there.

1244
01:15:19,409 --> 01:15:21,639
No, no. Massage
the trigger finger.

1245
01:15:21,744 --> 01:15:24,304
All right.

1246
01:15:26,115 --> 01:15:29,846
Mr. Kidley!
Oh, John!
John, wait!

1247
01:15:29,953 --> 01:15:32,888
Hey, Jeepers!
Juno.
Oh, John!

1248
01:15:32,989 --> 01:15:35,890
Oh, John, dear.
These are from us.

1249
01:15:35,992 --> 01:15:39,359
Me too, Mr. Kidley.
Ain't it wonderful?
We're gonna be married.

1250
01:15:39,462 --> 01:15:42,590
She swept me
right off my feet.
I can't believe it myself.

1251
01:15:42,699 --> 01:15:44,894
He's whittled his way
right into my heart.

1252
01:15:45,001 --> 01:15:47,231
Yeah, we found the bonds
you left me, Mr. Kidley.

1253
01:15:47,337 --> 01:15:49,771
Oh, no. This time
it's really love, John.

1254
01:15:49,872 --> 01:15:53,808
Good-bye, John.
[Chuckling]
Good-bye. Good-bye?

1255
01:15:57,380 --> 01:15:59,644
You got everything
all fixed now?
Yes.

1256
01:15:59,749 --> 01:16:01,808
All you got to do
is tell him this:

1257
01:16:01,918 --> 01:16:04,853
There's a cross on
the muzzle of the pistol
with the bullet...

1258
01:16:04,954 --> 01:16:07,422
and a nick on
the handle of the pistol
with the blank.

1259
01:16:07,523 --> 01:16:09,684
Oh, I see. Oh, yeah.
That's great.

1260
01:16:09,792 --> 01:16:11,692
Gimme that again.

1261
01:16:11,794 --> 01:16:14,024
There's a cross on
the muzzle of the pistol
with the bullet...

1262
01:16:14,130 --> 01:16:16,428
and a nick on
the handle of the pistol
with the blank.

1263
01:16:16,532 --> 01:16:19,160
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1264
01:16:19,268 --> 01:16:21,702
There's a cross
on the muzzle...

1265
01:16:21,804 --> 01:16:25,205
It is a question of honor.
I will call you.

1266
01:16:25,308 --> 01:16:28,471
...and a cross...
No, a nick on a bullet.

1267
01:16:28,578 --> 01:16:31,103
Huh-uh. On the handle.
And...

1268
01:16:33,282 --> 01:16:37,184
Cross on the muzzle of
the pistol with the bullet, and
a nick on the handle of the...

1269
01:16:37,286 --> 01:16:40,187
Courage, sir.
Mr. Kidley!
Yes?

1270
01:16:40,289 --> 01:16:42,348
You're not
gonna die!
I'm not gonna die?

1271
01:16:42,458 --> 01:16:44,517
You're not gonna be shot.
Oh, that's fine!
Let's get outta here!

1272
01:16:44,627 --> 01:16:47,653
No, wait a minute.
Jeepers, you stand
right over here.
Yes.

1273
01:16:47,764 --> 01:16:50,096
Don't let them see us.
Promise me.
No, miss.

1274
01:16:50,199 --> 01:16:52,258
I fixed it, see.
You have?

1275
01:16:52,368 --> 01:16:54,666
When you pick out the gun,
remember this.
Yeah?

1276
01:16:54,771 --> 01:16:58,002
Remember: There's a cross
on the muzzle of the pistol
with the bullet...

1277
01:16:58,107 --> 01:17:00,200
Yeah?
And a mick on
the nandle...

1278
01:17:00,309 --> 01:17:03,335
I mean, a nick on
the handle of the pistol
with the blank.

1279
01:17:03,446 --> 01:17:06,847
Oh, Mickey.
Give that again, quick.
Yeah.

1280
01:17:06,949 --> 01:17:11,283
There's a muzzle on the cross
of... I mean, a cross on
the muzzle of the... on the...

1281
01:17:11,387 --> 01:17:14,015
Mickey,
this is my life.
I'll save it.

1282
01:17:14,123 --> 01:17:16,182
There's a...
Don't get excited now.

1283
01:17:22,699 --> 01:17:24,599
Kretsky.

1284
01:17:25,902 --> 01:17:28,166
Kretsky,
we cannot lose.
Huh?

1285
01:17:28,271 --> 01:17:32,139
One of the pistols
has no bullet in it.
What?

1286
01:17:32,241 --> 01:17:35,074
It is marvelous!

1287
01:17:35,178 --> 01:17:38,079
But how do you know
which one?
It's very simple.

1288
01:17:38,181 --> 01:17:40,479
There is a cross on
the muzzle of the pistol
with the bullet...

1289
01:17:40,583 --> 01:17:42,778
and a nick on the handle
of the pistol with the blank.
[Chuckles]

1290
01:17:42,885 --> 01:17:47,049
Brilliant, Your Highness.
Superb. What an idea.

1291
01:17:47,156 --> 01:17:50,592
A nick on the muzzle
of the pistol with the...

1292
01:17:50,693 --> 01:17:54,561
No, no, no.
I said, there is
a nick on the handle.

1293
01:17:54,664 --> 01:17:58,657
Your Highness
distinctly said,
a cross on the handle.

1294
01:17:58,768 --> 01:18:04,001
No, no. I said, there is
a nick on the bullet on
the handle... You see?

1295
01:18:04,107 --> 01:18:08,168
[Man] Attention.
The principals will now proceed
to the center of the field.

1296
01:18:08,277 --> 01:18:12,043
Mr. Kidley, please!
They're ready
for you, sir.

1297
01:18:12,148 --> 01:18:15,379
All right.
All right.

1298
01:18:15,485 --> 01:18:19,512
I've got it. And a mistol
on the nozzle of the pistol
with the blank.

1299
01:18:19,622 --> 01:18:23,422
There is a cross
on the handle of the muzzle
with the bullet.

1300
01:18:23,526 --> 01:18:27,963
No. There is
a cross on the handle
of the nickel... nizzle?

1301
01:18:28,064 --> 01:18:31,761
No! And a nick on
the pullet of the whistle
with the blank.

1302
01:18:31,868 --> 01:18:34,496
Yeah, all right.
Stand away. I think
I've got it. Yeah.
Yeah?

1303
01:18:34,604 --> 01:18:37,767
There's a noss on
the crizzle of the mistol
with the pillet...

1304
01:18:39,242 --> 01:18:42,109
and a pullet on
the nozzle of the nickel
with the blank.

1305
01:18:42,211 --> 01:18:45,908
There's a cross on the puzzle
of the mistol with the bullet.
There's a...

1306
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:47,915
[Whimpering]

1307
01:18:50,119 --> 01:18:52,019
[Both Click Heels]

1308
01:18:55,458 --> 01:18:59,519
Gentlemen,
select your weapons.

1309
01:18:59,629 --> 01:19:02,097
- There is a nickel
in the cuzzle...
- Huddle on the...

1310
01:19:02,198 --> 01:19:04,826
handle of the bullet
with the pretzel.

1311
01:19:04,934 --> 01:19:06,834
Here, here, gentlemen.
Come, come.

1312
01:19:06,936 --> 01:19:10,064
[Together]
There's a cuzzle on the muzzle
of the bullet with the blanket...

1313
01:19:10,173 --> 01:19:13,040
and a whistle on the panel
of the noodle with the cross.

1314
01:19:13,142 --> 01:19:15,042
Shut up!
You shut up!

1315
01:19:15,144 --> 01:19:19,171
Now, really, gentlemen.
This is no time
for incantations. What?

1316
01:19:19,282 --> 01:19:22,479
- Cross!
- [Whispers] No!

1317
01:19:28,424 --> 01:19:30,324
Oh!

1318
01:19:32,328 --> 01:19:36,594
- The cross on the muzzle!
- And a nick on the handle
of the pistol with the blank.

1319
01:19:40,236 --> 01:19:45,037
Yeah, blank.
Ah, ah, ah.
Ready?

1320
01:19:45,141 --> 01:19:48,008
Would you like to trade
pistols? I'll give you
mine and $40, Mr. Smirnov.

1321
01:19:48,110 --> 01:19:50,169
Thank you, I am
very well satisfied.

1322
01:19:50,279 --> 01:19:52,338
I can't shoot with mine.
I'm left-handed.

1323
01:19:52,448 --> 01:19:54,848
It will not make
any difference
which hand you use.

1324
01:19:54,951 --> 01:19:57,511
Gentlemen,
take your places.

1325
01:20:03,326 --> 01:20:05,226
Ah!

1326
01:20:07,930 --> 01:20:11,195
On the word march,
you will...
You dropped your pistol.

1327
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:13,291
No, you dropped yours!

1328
01:20:13,402 --> 01:20:15,302
Oh.

1329
01:20:17,707 --> 01:20:19,902
Pardon.

1330
01:20:20,009 --> 01:20:21,909
Gentlemen,
retire.

1331
01:20:23,312 --> 01:20:26,042
On the word march,
you will start walking.

1332
01:20:26,148 --> 01:20:28,912
At ten paces
you will turn and fire.

1333
01:20:29,018 --> 01:20:32,954
Ready? March.
One, two... No, no!
Halt!

1334
01:20:33,055 --> 01:20:35,353
Halt!
Exception.

1335
01:20:35,458 --> 01:20:37,517
Doesn't he know
the rules?

1336
01:20:37,627 --> 01:20:40,596
Oh, Mr. Kidley.
Are you going to go
through with this?

1337
01:20:40,696 --> 01:20:44,154
Or do you wish to be
branded as a coward?
Yes!

1338
01:20:44,267 --> 01:20:46,326
Bravo.
D...
Very well, then.

1339
01:20:47,503 --> 01:20:50,301
Ready again.
March.

1340
01:20:50,406 --> 01:20:53,273
One, two, three, four...

1341
01:20:53,376 --> 01:20:57,745
five, six, seven, eight,
Don't hurry.
Take careful aim.

1342
01:20:57,847 --> 01:21:00,179
Nine, ten!

1343
01:21:00,283 --> 01:21:02,410
[Crowd Chattering Excitedly]

1344
01:21:02,518 --> 01:21:04,850
What kind of blanks
are these?

1345
01:21:04,954 --> 01:21:09,357
Gee, Mrs. Marko,
that sure was white of ya.
You sure can shoot too.

1346
01:21:09,458 --> 01:21:11,949
Always remember that,
Henry my love.

1347
01:21:12,061 --> 01:21:16,361
Oh, Mr. Kidley!
You did it! You shot the hand
right out of his revolver!

1348
01:21:16,465 --> 01:21:19,866
Yeah! Imagine what
I'd have done to him if
I'd had a bullet in it.

1349
01:21:19,969 --> 01:21:21,869
Oh, John,
you're wonderful.

1350
01:21:21,971 --> 01:21:25,702
Gee, Mr. Kidley,
I got so excited,
l... I called you John.

1351
01:21:25,808 --> 01:21:28,572
Oh... that's okay,
Mrs. Kidley.
