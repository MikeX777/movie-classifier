2
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,480
Please don't tell anyone about this.

3
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,760
The whole neighborhood already knows!

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,480
The whole neighborhood?
Who told you?

5
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,520
Forget it. Nobody knows.

6
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,680
Exactly.

7
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,320
Half the neighbors did it.

8
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,080
I didn't do the job for them.

9
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,680
They extended it themselves?

10
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,320
Who told you?

11
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,920
- Nobody.
- I'm doing this as a favor.

12
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,240
Is this a tree clipper?

13
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,000
Just let me work!

14
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,720
What's wrong?

15
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,120
Why are you barefoot, darling?

16
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,960
It's too dark inside.

17
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,800
Wasn't dinner at my parents
better than this?

18
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,120
Why are you mad?

19
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,040
I already told you I have an important
meeting tonight.

20
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,360
You always have important meetings!

21
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,480
You have to visit my parents,
they want to see you.

22
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,400
I can't tonight, at all.

23
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,440
But I already told them
we're coming tonight.

24
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,640
Apologize to them.

25
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,760
Apologize again?

26
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,760
Then don't apologize!

27
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,600
There'll be no mercy in this game!

28
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,200
It's the fifth time he's calling.

29
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,840
I don't know what to tell him.

30
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,400
He's already waited for three weeks,
he can wait another day.

31
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,360
You've been saying this for 3 weeks!

32
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,560
I can't make a living because of you.

33
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,640
I'll solve it tomorrow.

34
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,856
The custom's guy promised
that it will be done by tomorrow 10 am.

35
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,640
If you don't pay him under the table,
the laptops will rust

36
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,680
and you'll be wasting your time!

37
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,400
You're right, Abu Sameer,
you have to pay him,

38
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,920
and that's why you'll pay the price
with this King!

39
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,880
Should I be stuck with this card?

40
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,480
Who else, me?

41
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,760
- Good for you.
- You don't know how to play.

42
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,040
Do you have diamond cards?

43
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,600
None.

44
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,920
Show me.

45
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,816
Forget about my cards,
you don't know how to play!

46
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,160
I swear, I won't play with you.

47
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,160
Come on, man.

48
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,600
No way, I won't play.

49
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,920
I'll still write down your score!

50
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,520
Here comes the nagging!
My wife is calling.

51
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,320
Why is everybody grumpy tonight?

52
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,800
Hello. Yes, darling.

53
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,520
What's wrong with Mom? Why?

54
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,080
Ok, lock the door, I'll be home soon.

55
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,520
Ok, bye, darling.

56
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,040
Is everything ok?

57
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,920
As usual, my wife got mad.

58
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,920
We were supposed to visit her parents,
and we didn't.

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,440
The girls are home alone?

60
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,839
Yes.

61
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,280
We're done for tonight! Leave.

62
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,200
Don't forget about tomorrow.

63
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,520
The guy filed a lawsuit against me.

64
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,800
Don't worry.

65
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,080
Make some room, guys.

66
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,040
Please, guys.

67
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,840
- Hello.
- Hello.

68
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,800
Your ID, please.

69
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,080
Who are you?

70
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,400
Criminal investigation.

71
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,360
Can I see your ID?

72
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,640
Sure, it is your right.

73
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,320
Never mind.

74
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,720
Here you go, sir.

75
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,280
- Ahmad Taher?
- Yes.

76
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,200
Can you please come with us?

77
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,440
What is wrong?

78
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,640
We need you at the station for 5 minutes.

79
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,576
Those 5 minutes will become a year!

80
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,680
You'll be out in an hour.

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,760
Can I make a call?

82
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,240
I want to inform my wife
and I have stuff in my car.

83
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,680
- Is it urgent?
- Yes.

84
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,480
Hello.

85
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,040
Cousin, listen.

86
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,320
I don't have time for hellos and all that.

87
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,440
Come take the car, its next to
the juice shop opposite the phone shop.

88
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,120
The key is inside.

89
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,760
Where am I going?
It's your fault!

90
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,400
I got dragged by the ants!

91
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,680
Sir, can I have a cigarette?

92
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,760
I wish it was up to me

93
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,920
but it's not allowed,
do you see the camera up there?

94
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,800
Will I go to court today?

95
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,520
It won't be till tomorrow.

96
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,680
What?

97
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,840
I'm staying here till tomorrow?

98
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,680
No. I'll take you to a bigger cell
downstairs.

99
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,000
Can you take me now? I want to sleep.

100
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,040
You need to wait till someone joins you.

101
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,400
You ruined my life!

102
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,160
You know the law, it's your fault.

103
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,360
Stop it now.

104
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,920
Didn't you see me coming from behind?

105
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,080
How could I see you? I wasn't in the car!

106
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,960
It's your fault!
You hit the rear of my car!

107
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,720
Stop it, guys.

108
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,160
Not a single word.
Don't talk till I ask you to.

109
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,600
Tell me what happened.

110
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,680
Sir, I was driving all peacefully,

111
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,416
and he suddenly popped out in front of me.

112
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,440
I was parked there for 5 hours!

113
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,160
You think I can afford wasting 5 hours!

114
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,160
Do you know how much it costs for a taxi
to park for 5 hours?

115
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,240
I hit the brakes 5 meters away
from your car.

116
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,640
You wrecked it after I fixed it.

117
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,560
The bumper was new sir!

118
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,480
I followed the rules.

119
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,480
According to the law, it's your fault,
since you hit my rear!

120
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,680
And who dripped the oil on the street!

121
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,920
I don't know about the oil.

122
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Guys.

123
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,840
- It was like a new bride, sir.
- You suddenly popped up in the street.

124
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,280
- You hit my rear!
- Stop it, guys.

125
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,120
Guys, just relax for a minute.

126
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,800
I think it's the mechanic's fault
for dripping the oil.

127
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,280
Need anything, old man?

128
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,920
Yes, a cigarette, please!

129
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,240
Give him a cigarette, sir.

130
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,080
He's sitting there like a chicken.

131
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,600
Have some mercy, he's a human being.

132
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:08,600
Stop blabbering,
another word and you'll be joining him.

133
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,840
Wait outside for the patrol officer.

134
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,880
Not another word.

135
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,760
Give me a 100 Dinars
and I'll call it a day.

136
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,520
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

137
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,720
God! Finally someone joins me.

138
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,040
What brought you here?

139
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,000
I finished a year's sentence yesterday.

140
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,920
What were you in for?

141
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,800
Forged checks.

142
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,200
You spent a year inside?

143
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,280
Was it worth it?

144
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,480
The checks bought me 4 cars.

145
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,640
If I worked a whole year...

146
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,560
I won't even be able to buy a tire!

147
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,640
That's true!

148
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,600
What about you?

149
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,880
Nothing serious.

150
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,120
I'll be out tomorrow,
when my cousin pays bail.

151
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,160
Good morning.

152
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,840
Good morning!

153
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,960
Just in time, your papers are ready.

154
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,280
Really?

155
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,400
Yes, it's just missing
the manager's signature.

156
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,360
Your file is on his desk.
It's just missing one signature.

157
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,480
Ok, get it signed.

158
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,400
He's off today.

159
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,160
It's his son's wedding today.

160
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,640
I wish he was here,
I could have congratulated him.

161
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,400
He would've liked that.

162
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Listen

163
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,360
I've been running back and forth
for a while and it's a new story everyday.

164
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,040
Please help me get the laptops released.

165
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,840
It's not up to me, you know that.

166
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,920
But it's in his hand now
and he's busy with the wedding these days

167
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,056
and Eid holiday is coming up

168
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,416
and he has to get lots of sheep for feasts
for a lot of guests

169
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,840
and the sheep should be local
because imported sheep are tasteless

170
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,600
and the local markets
only have imported sheep.

171
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,960
You're right, no point of a feast
without local sheep!

172
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,520
- It's an embarrassment.
- Exactly!

173
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,600
You're right!

174
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,520
- It will be fine.
- God willing.

175
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,080
So, Salameh, where did you find
the Islamic center receipts?

176
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,336
I found them on the street, sir.

177
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,800
You found them on the street?

178
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,480
Cut the crap, smart ass!

179
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,840
Listen, Salameh,

180
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,680
I'm a civilized and an understanding
District Attorney

181
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,560
but don't make me jump on this table

182
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,920
do a couple of somersaults

183
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
and go back in time 4,000 years
and become a savage monster

184
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,200
and stomp on your stomach.

185
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,120
So, don't push me too far,
and tell me the truth.

186
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,400
- Where did you get them from?
- I printed them, sir.

187
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,760
You should've said that from the start.

188
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,120
You scumbag,

189
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,160
you scam in the name
of the Islamic center?

190
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,280
Go scam women who drive
fancy Jeeps instead!

191
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,600
Zuhair.

192
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,400
Take him, please.

193
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,800
Move it!

194
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,760
What do you do?

195
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,800
A contractor.

196
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,120
A contractor.

197
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,200
Did you take 1800 Dinars
from the plaintiff?

198
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,640
- Yes, I did.
- But I wanted to...

199
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,280
- So you took them?
- Yes, I took them.

200
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,440
That's all I want to know.

201
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,400
Sir, give me a couple of days...

202
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,000
You can ask the judge for that,
not me,

203
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,840
I can't help you at all.

204
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,360
Take him officer.

205
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,640
What are you in for?

206
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,920
Fraud.

207
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,240
God bless you!

208
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,160
Put your arms up.

209
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,320
Here you go.

210
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,760
Just knock on the door for anything
you need, I am available.

211
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,880
What do you do?

212
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,120
A contractor.

213
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,240
Man...

214
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,360
I started building a room on my roof
but ran out of money.

215
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,200
I don't know what to do.

216
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,520
I'd help, but I'm off to prison.

217
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,080
I'll keep them standing
till a miracle happens!

218
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,360
Sir, can I make a call?

219
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,880
It's not allowed, but here, make it quick.

220
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,360
Hello.

221
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,520
Tell my cousin to come
to Tareq station urgently.

222
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,720
Guys, I'm collecting money
to buy us dinner.

223
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,840
Each has to pay 2.5 Dinars.

224
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,560
It will get us a decent dinner.

225
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,040
Let's all pitch in, so we can eat.

226
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,000
Do you want to pay for dinner?

227
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,880
No, thanks.

228
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,080
As you like!

229
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,360
Did you check that apartment for rent?

230
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,280
I did, but it has no balcony.

231
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,000
The balcony isn't important.

232
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,640
We need to leave this apartment.

233
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,960
But this one is closer to Mom's house.

234
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,200
That's why we should leave.

235
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,840
Ahmad Taher Farraj.

236
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,000
Is my cousin here?

237
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,560
What cousin?

238
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,240
Didn't you ask me for food?

239
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,360
Yes, food and cigarettes.

240
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,440
So give me 7 Dinars.

241
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,840
5 is enough.

242
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,080
No problem, you'll get the food soon.

243
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,760
But don't tell anyone that you paid me.

244
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,200
Why, is food illegal here?

245
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,720
Just do as you're told!

246
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,280
How much did you pay him?

247
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
5 Dinars.

248
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,240
If you paid me you
would've saved a lot.

249
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,520
- He pockets the rest!
- So what.

250
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,560
Osama Melhim Qaddoura.

251
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,040
- Did you take the goods?
- Yes, sir.

252
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,400
Did the plaintiff drop the charges?

253
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,600
No, sir.

254
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,200
Your sentence is 8 months.

255
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,520
This isn't fair.

256
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,000
8 months is good,
you already got the money! Go!

257
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,400
You, come closer.

258
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,880
- Ahmad Taher Farraj.
- Yes, sir.

259
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,120
Swear on the Holy Quran to tell the truth.

260
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,120
I swear to tell the truth
and nothing but the truth.

261
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,240
Were you paid to build the wall?

262
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,600
Yes, sir.

263
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,840
Did you build the wall?

264
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,640
I couldn't build it, I had a situation.

265
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,200
But I can repay the plaintiff.

266
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,000
So you took the money,
but didn't build the wall?

267
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,240
Exactly.

268
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,320
Why didn't you pay him back then?

269
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,040
Your sentence is 3 months.

270
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,080
You have anything to say?

271
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,400
3 months?

272
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,760
Sir, I want to appoint a lawyer, please.

273
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,480
Why?

274
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,120
It's only 3 months.

275
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,000
It's fair.

276
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,080
But I have the money, I can get out today.

277
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,880
Pay and I'll let you go.

278
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,360
Next.

279
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,359
Please wait for 10 minutes.

280
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,599
My phone battery is dead.
Can I use yours?

281
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:29,160
Sorry, I don't have credit.

282
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,840
Where can I recharge mine?

283
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,240
You want to recharge it?

284
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,480
Let's take a walk.

285
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,880
What are you talking about?

286
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,520
I just got sentenced.

287
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,120
We'll look for a charger.

288
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,000
I'll find you the best charger.

289
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,400
Do you have internet on your phone?

290
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,000
No.

291
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,200
Do you have a Facebook account?

292
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,880
No, I don't.

293
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,080
Can you create a Facebook account
without the internet?

294
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,520
You can't create one
without the internet.

295
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,720
I heard that one gets to meet people
from any country.

296
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,080
What do I need to make an account?

297
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,440
You need electricity, a phone, a landline
and a decent picture.

298
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,720
What are you looking for? The girl left.

299
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,240
What girl? I'm looking for a charger!

300
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,920
- Hello.
- Hello.

301
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,920
How much are the sheep for?

302
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,560
- What kind?
- A local one.

303
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,840
I have one.

304
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,080
For how much?

305
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,960
150 Dinars.

306
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,560
I need a discount.

307
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,760
What do you mean?

308
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,440
130 Dinars is fair.

309
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,080
- Do you think I stole it?
- Of course not.

310
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,440
- Do you want it?
- Yes!

311
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,760
Then pay 150!

312
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,840
- That's your best price?
- Yes!

313
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,600
Don't worry. I trust this guy.

314
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,040
Tell the driver to go faster we're bored.

315
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,720
And turn the fan on.

316
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,640
How about I get you air-conditioning?

317
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,120
Let me take this.

318
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,920
Hello. It's all fine.

319
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,400
We didn't expect to get off this easily.

320
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,400
Much better than we thought.

321
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,160
What are you guys in for?

322
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,200
Have you heard of the stock market case?

323
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,560
Yes.

324
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,200
We are the stock market guys.

325
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,360
You did a great job!

326
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,520
Goodbye.

327
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,080
Can I use your phone?

328
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,120
Sure. And take your time.

329
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,480
Thanks!

330
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,000
This is a touch phone.

331
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,800
Wait.

332
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,600
Hello.

333
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,720
Hello.

334
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,360
Cousin, I got sentenced.

335
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,960
What?

336
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,040
One second.

337
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,880
The sheep! Wait.

338
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,040
God damn you.

339
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,360
Just a minute.

340
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,760
What sheep? Hello!

341
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,080
Attention!

342
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,280
Where are the stock market guys?

343
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,920
Stand at the other side.

344
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,560
There are rules you must follow here.

345
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,640
Calls are absolutely forbidden.

346
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,280
No visits for the first 6 months.

347
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,760
No integration with prisoners. Understood?

348
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,120
What do you want?

349
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,560
I am not with them, sir.

350
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,640
What are you in for?

351
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,600
Fraud.

352
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,240
Why are you standing with them then?
Get the hell away!

353
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,040
Are my rules clear?

354
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,120
Give me your hand!

355
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,520
Your prints. The first finger.

356
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,480
The second here.

357
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,880
The third here.

358
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,160
The fourth.

359
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,480
Your thumb here.

360
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,760
Change your clothes.

361
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,800
Put your belongings in the safe
then go to cell 6W.

362
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,800
- Move it.
- Next!

363
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,520
Higher.

364
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,800
AHMAD TAHER FARRAJ - FRAUD

365
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,920
Turn right.

366
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,920
Sir, I need a drink of water.

367
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,320
After dinner!

368
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,360
I'm really thirsty.

369
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,160
Can't you wait till after dinner?

370
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,920
Do you want to end up in solitary tonight!

371
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,080
Everybody stand up!

372
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,960
Stand in line. Next to the wall.

373
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,400
- Welcome sir.
- Hello.

374
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,840
- How are you?
- I'm well.

375
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,640
- Welcome, sir.
- Thanks.

376
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,560
- How are you?
- Good.

377
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,200
What are you in for?

378
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,400
Fraud.

379
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,440
Welcome, sir. Let me take this.

380
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,080
Are you joining us for a long time?

381
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,360
- I hope not!
- Be patient.

382
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,720
See the Friday flee market there?

383
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,600
That man is our cell leader.

384
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,240
Fine, but I need to sleep.

385
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,320
Go see him first.

386
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,440
- I'll do it, sir.
- I want to sleep.

387
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,400
Mor, here is Tuesday's batch, one piece!

388
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,760
Come here.

389
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,080
Have some coffee.

390
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,080
Bis, make us some coffee.

391
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,440
- You have plenty of time.
- Hello.

392
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,760
Hello.

393
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,760
Welcome.

394
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,280
What brought you here?

395
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,760
Fraud.

396
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,760
Did you benefit from it?

397
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,200
Not really.

398
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,680
God bless you.

399
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,600
This is my shop.
It's all at your disposal.

400
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,960
All these prisoners are my customers

401
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,440
and now you'll become my customer too.

402
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,800
Give me 15 Dinars to open
an instant account for you.

403
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,640
Plus 1 Dinar for cleaning service.

404
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,000
Now?

405
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,640
Yes. Why are you scared?

406
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,360
Come on.

407
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,320
I have 20. Give me back 5.

408
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,080
20?

409
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:50,200
15 plus 1 for cleaning,
then you'll have 4 on tab.

410
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,640
So you're in for fraud?

411
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,480
Not a big deal.

412
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,120
Just 1800 Dinars.

413
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,200
What?

414
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,720
Yes.

415
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:03,640
An old man like you in prison
for 1800 Dinars?

416
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,840
I don't know what to say.

417
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,480
Did you confess?

418
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,160
Yes, I did.

419
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,520
Why did you confess?

420
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,600
I swore on the Holy Quran.

421
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,280
You are a moron
for doing this to yourself!

422
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,560
Yes, I'm an idiot!

423
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,080
But I couldn't lie with my hand
on the Quran.

424
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,680
Bis prepared your bed, go have some rest.

425
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,040
God bless you, my dear.

426
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,240
Sir.

427
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,400
Sir.

428
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,440
- What?
- I prepared your bed.

429
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,880
What do you want?

430
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,600
Can you believe I had no visits
in the past 6 months?

431
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,560
Can you please give me some cigarettes?

432
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,760
Take 2 from under the pillow.

433
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,240
Get some rest.

434
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,320
If you want cigarettes, just call me.

435
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,040
You took the whole pack?

436
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,720
- You want the pack?
- Of course I do!

437
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,960
- I was guarding it for you.
- I told you to take 2.

438
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,360
- It's your turn.
- I pass!

439
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,200
How come? Who has the Jack?

440
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,880
Pass.

441
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,760
- Here's a 7.
- What's the use of a 7!

442
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,520
I have the 9! Just play.

443
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,480
- Pass.
- Just focus, Dead Man!

444
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,600
Shut the hell up!

445
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,560
Turn the light on, old man!

446
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,920
How am I supposed to sleep?

447
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,240
That's your problem.

448
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,160
Why did you sleep up there?

449
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,160
Turn it on and let the night go in peace

450
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,960
or I'll come up to you!

451
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,400
Wait, I can't see.

452
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,720
Turn it on!

453
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,800
Turn on the damn light.

454
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,440
Just ignore him, man.

455
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,840
How can I ignore him,
I can't see the cards.

456
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,920
Come on, play.

457
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,320
- I don't want to play!
- Come on, play!

458
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,880
Don't ruin the game, don't be a child!

459
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,760
Go to bed!

460
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,880
He drove me crazy!

461
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,320
Cell count!

462
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,040
Turn the light on.

463
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:34,760
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...

464
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,560
Did you turn off the water tap?

465
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,920
Of course.

466
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,640
From now on,
always keep the water running.

467
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,320
Why waste all that water?

468
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,800
Are you paying for it from
your own pocket?

469
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,160
When you leave it running,
the bathroom stays clean.

470
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,840
One can have a clean shower
and feel fresh.

471
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,720
So keep it running next time!

472
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,120
Fine, no problem.

473
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,920
Pass the ball.

474
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,880
I'm so sick of this,
please get me out of here.

475
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,640
It's almost over, cousin!

476
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,240
Just pay the 1800 Dinars. I've had it!

477
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,440
What did the lawyer tell you?

478
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,000
What lawyer?

479
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,880
Who asked for Ahmad Taher?

480
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,240
Hello.

481
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,800
Hello.

482
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,080
Are you my lawyer?

483
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,840
Yes, your cousin appointed me
for your case.

484
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,736
You'll get the money in the coming
couple of days.

485
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:28,720
I know, just sign the proxy
so I can start working.

486
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,240
My fees are 200 Dinars, 100 is due now
and 100 is due when you get out.

487
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,880
Is my case easy?

488
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,400
As simple as a drink of water!
I don't even consider this a case.

489
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,520
I'll be out before Eid?

490
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,800
For sure, just like I can see you
right now!

491
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,920
You'll dress up and celebrate
with your kids.

492
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,760
Sign here so I can start working.

493
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,560
- Here you go.
- May God bless you.

494
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,840
Let's hope so!

495
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,240
Please walk me to the door.

496
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,760
Don't be sad, darling.
Smile for our guests.

497
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,040
I'm so scared, Mom.

498
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,200
Don't be scared.
He's your husband now.

499
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,160
What if he beats me up?

500
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,600
Oh, my God!
Where did you get such an idea?

501
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,160
I'm scared, Mom.

502
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,040
Why would he beat you up?

503
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,760
- Come greet your guests.
- I'm coming.

504
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,640
Coffee. Coffee's ready, guys.

505
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,520
Sugarless, semi-sweet
and sweet coffee.

506
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,800
It's hot and ready.

507
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,920
Coffee, guys.

508
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,520
Get the hell out of here!

509
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,080
You're all watching this series now!

510
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,320
I won't leave till this thermos is empty!

511
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,320
- Coffee is ready, guys.
- Bis, no one has time for you.

512
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:29,520
- Coffee is hot and ready.
- Bis! We don't want your damn coffee!

513
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,000
Coffee, guys. Coffee.

514
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,320
Damn you!

515
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,560
Coffee.

516
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,240
Cell count!

517
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,920
Turn on the light.

518
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,520
It doesn't work.

519
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,240
Why?

520
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,520
There is no starter.

521
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,800
Where is it?

522
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,159
I don't know.

523
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:13,239
- You don't know?
- No, I don't.

524
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,199
Ok.

525
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,880
Search for it in every hole!

526
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,960
Search over there.

527
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,600
There's the sheep! Get it!

528
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,680
Wake up.

529
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,800
Wake up! Hurry up.

530
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,400
Wake up.

531
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,560
Get up. Faster.

532
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,880
Put your hands on the wall.

533
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,240
You don't want to admit
who took the starter?

534
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,560
So it grew legs and ran off?

535
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,200
This starter is your responsibility.

536
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,680
You will all be punished for this!

537
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,040
One of you, man up and confess!

538
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,160
The cell is ready for inspection, sir.

539
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,920
Sir, they don't want to admit
who took the starter.

540
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,520
Repeat after me, guys.

541
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,240
Long live his Majesty the King!

542
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,200
May he live!

543
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,280
Long live his Majesty the King!

544
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,240
May he live.

545
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,600
Long live his Majesty the King!

546
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,600
May he live!

547
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,000
Are they dismissed, sir?

548
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,640
They may go.

549
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,080
Dismissed!

550
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,440
Quickly.

551
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,200
Quickly.

552
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,280
Come here, boy.

553
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,560
Where is Abu Haitham's house?

554
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,840
This is his son.

555
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,360
- You're his son?
- Yes.

556
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,960
- Where is your house?
- Over there.

557
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,360
- That one?
- Yes.

558
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,480
Please get your father.

559
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,680
Welcome.

560
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,120
Hello.

561
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,560
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

562
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,000
Praise God. Is it local?

563
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,560
Local, like you wanted!

564
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,600
- Please come in.
- Thanks.

565
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,880
Praise God.

566
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,440
Local, like you requested.

567
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,960
Fouad Mohamed Abdel Majeed.

568
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:20,920
Yes.

569
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,120
You've been released.

570
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,920
Bring your things and follow me.

571
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,280
Wait?

572
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,440
Where are you going?

573
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,320
What's up?

574
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,920
You think you can just move to that bed?

575
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,600
I have a bad back.
I can't climb up to the high beds.

576
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:12,000
You think I can? I am a monkey in a circus
jumping around all day?

577
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,960
You're not a monkey or anything, but...

578
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,600
Put back the mattress,
I've been here longer so it's my turn.

579
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,480
- Ok.
- Stop!

580
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:25,720
You had a bottom bed, but you broke it.

581
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:29,520
If you care about him, give him your bed
and get rid of your shopping mall!

582
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:33,040
What? You want my bed? It's better for you
to go back to your bed.

583
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,440
You care about him because he buys
a lot from you?

584
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,920
- Shut up.
- To hell with you and your mall.

585
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,760
Shut up and go to your bed.

586
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:46,400
- He pays you always so you care for him!
- Shut up.

587
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,560
- Mor, ignore him.
- I've had it with you!

588
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,920
I got the bed, no issues.

589
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,520
What is Dead Man's story?

590
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,840
He bought himself a life insurance policy.

591
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,360
And next day faked his own death

592
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,800
and issued his own death certificate

593
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,720
and in return got 100,000 Dinars!

594
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,320
Wow!

595
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,640
How did he fake it?

596
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,480
He spoofed his brother's identity.
He looks a lot like him.

597
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,120
There is no evidence
proving he's still alive.

598
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,120
He agreed with his wife
that she'd collect the money.

599
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,600
When she found out that he made
his brother the only beneficiary

600
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:56,320
she went insane, so she reported him
and he ended up here.

601
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,240
He's an idiot!

602
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,040
An ass, a mule!

603
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,120
That's why we call him Dead Man.

604
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,240
The problem is he's worthless
and arrogant.

605
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,440
A bed wetter and wants
to sleep in the middle?

606
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,240
Good one!

607
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,600
Guys, the warden is coming for a visit.

608
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,960
Listen carefully and focus.

609
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,760
Let's all sing together.

610
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,880
Don't ask vague questions.

611
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,920
Let's be organized and talk one at a time.

612
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,080
I have great suggestions
to make our lives better.

613
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:48,880
Therefore, I should be first to speak. Ok?

614
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,880
You always do this!

615
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,640
You only ask for extra calls for yourself.

616
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,520
That's not true.

617
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,840
Who got you extra calls last time?

618
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,520
As usual!

619
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,200
Come on, guys.

620
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,000
Cell W6, attention!

621
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,880
Long live his Majesty the King.

622
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,160
May he...

623
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:21,000
- How is everything?
- We are well, sir.

624
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,160
Any requests?

625
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,560
All is good.

626
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,160
If you allow me to speak.

627
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:31,440
I really need to call my wife.

628
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,640
- Let him make a call.
- Yes, sir.

629
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,880
I need a call, too.

630
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,120
Let him make a call, too.

631
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,760
Let 10 men make calls.

632
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,240
The ones that didn't call last time.

633
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,880
God bless you.

634
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,360
It's our fault!

635
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,360
Yes!

636
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,440
What's up, guys?

637
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:57,720
I haven't called my wife in 3 months.

638
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,880
What a liar!

639
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,640
You keep promising to fix my computer
but doing nothing.

640
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,800
I'll fix it soon, be patient.

641
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:23,280
Please fix it,
I want to call my sister online.

642
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,080
Don't worry, I'll fix it soon.

643
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:40,240
10 NEW LAPTOPS IMPORTED FROM
CANADA FOR SALE FOR 6,000 DINARS

644
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,320
Please give me some good news!

645
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,640
Great news!

646
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,760
The laptops were released
from customs today!

647
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:52,440
I wish I could believe you!
It's been over 3 weeks.

648
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:56,080
I placed an ad in the newspaper
asking for retail cost.

649
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,880
I swear I made no profit!
I'll sell them soon and bail you out.

650
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,600
Are you sure?

651
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:08,360
Come on, cousin, I'm trying my best.
I'll keep you posted.

652
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,480
- Play, old man!
- Pass!

653
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:25,480
You pass more than you play!

654
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,280
We can't see, how can we play?

655
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,760
Cut this crap!

656
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:42,120
I won't switch on the light
and the cafe is closed. Go to bed!

657
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:45,600
Would you just cut the crap
and switch it on now!

658
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,896
Do it, before I force you to do!

659
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:50,000
Force me? You want the light? Sure.

660
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,720
Here, I switched it on.

661
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,800
Now get your ass over here!

662
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:00,800
I don't mind going to solitary tonight!

663
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,120
I said switch on the damn light!

664
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,440
Who the hell do you think you are?

665
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,920
He'll switch it on
whether he likes it or not!

666
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:15,560
You want the light?

667
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,920
Here's your light!

668
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,800
Here's your light!

669
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:27,560
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- Calm down, you guys.

670
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,600
No more playing cards! All of you to bed!

671
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,680
Go to bed!

672
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,600
What's all this shouting?

673
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,840
- He broke the light, sir.
- Who broke it?

674
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,000
- I broke it.
- Why?

675
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,616
They play cards all night,
we want to sleep!

676
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,400
Get your blanket and follow me.

677
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:49,400
Solitary is better than this shit hole.

678
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,376
Where did you get them from?

679
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,640
From Canada.

680
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,680
- They're all the same?
- Yes, you can check them if you like.

681
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,280
- The money is ready.
- Great.

682
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:12,640
Follow me to my office?

683
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:14,200
Sure.

684
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,520
How about you ride with me
rather than taking a taxi?

685
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:21,840
- That would be better.
- Fine, get in.

686
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,920
We'll move them to your car.

687
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,840
Wait here. I'll get the money
and come back.

688
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,240
Sure.

689
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,880
- Hello.
- Hello.

690
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,520
Yes, I can hear you.

691
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,000
Why don't you come up, sign the contract
and take the money.

692
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,600
What?

693
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,440
Can you see me?

694
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,560
Yes, I can see you.

695
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,320
The fourth floor, come up.

696
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:28,800
Are the laptops safe here?

697
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,320
Yes, I'll lock it now.

698
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,680
See, it's locked.

699
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,480
Ok, I'm coming up.

700
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,120
What are you still doing here?

701
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,600
Waiting for my lawyer.

702
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,840
If he wanted to come,
he would have by now!

703
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,120
Let's wait for a bit.

704
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,920
You can't wait any more,
I'm locking the cell in 10 minutes.

705
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,360
Get up! Come on.

706
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:15,760
The number you're calling is currently
switched off, please try again later.

707
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,640
You still didn't fix the computer.

708
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,880
I told you I'll fix it! Stop nagging!

709
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:54,880
What's this?

710
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,480
Open it!

711
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,760
Thanks, darling.

712
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,880
Looks like you're spending Eid
here, old man.

713
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,440
Mor, go see what's wrong with him.

714
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,840
What's wrong, my dear?

715
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:52,280
You don't seem to be good.
What's wrong?

716
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,160
Nothing's wrong.

717
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,520
Have some faith.

718
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:00,240
God is great and merciful.

719
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,880
I deserve what happened to me.

720
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:07,920
Stop it now. All will be fine.

721
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,400
Stop sulking.

722
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,280
You'll be out in no time.

723
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,280
It's only a few days.

724
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,400
They'll fly by in no time.

725
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,840
Believe me, when you get out...

726
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:23,040
you'll miss the prison days.

727
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,800
I don't know how my family is managing.

728
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,280
Eid is coming up.

729
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,120
Have faith in God.

730
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,720
Don't worry.

731
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,680
They won't die without you.

732
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:43,960
Let's go wash up for prayers, come on.

733
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,000
All praise is due to Allah,
Lord of the worlds

734
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:03,600
The Entirely Merciful,
Sovereign of the Day of Recompense.

735
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:08,400
It is You we worship
and You we ask for help.

736
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,800
Guide us to the straight path

737
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:15,880
The path of those upon whom
You have bestowed favor,

738
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:22,960
not of those who have evoked
Your anger or of those who are astray.

739
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,480
Amen.

740
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,760
By the morning brightness and
by the night when it covers with darkness,

741
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:36,720
Your Lord has not taken leave of you,
O Muhammad, nor has He detested you.

742
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:41,400
And the Hereafter is better for you
than the first life.

743
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:45,840
And your Lord is going to give you,
and you will be satisfied.

744
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:50,720
Did He not find you an orphan
and give you refuge?

745
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:56,240
And He found you lost and guided you,

746
00:53:56,320 --> 00:54:01,280
And He found you poor
and made you self-sufficient.

747
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:05,560
So as for the orphan,
do not oppress him.

748
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:10,560
And as for the petitioner,
do not repel him.

749
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:16,360
But as for the favor of your Lord,
report it.

750
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:19,960
- God is Great.
- God is Great.

751
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:15,400
<i>Finally! You've been promising
me to call for 2 months!</i>

752
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:19,600
<i>When you buy a dongle here,
it works as soon as you get home!</i>

753
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:22,496
Put your hands up. Don't move!

754
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,240
<i>What the hell is going on?</i>

755
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,280
- Search the house.
- What's happening?

756
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,840
How did you subscribe to the internet?

757
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,240
I used the family extract.

758
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,360
Very smart of you!

759
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,080
<i>What's going on?</i>

760
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:37,960
Get up.

761
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:42,800
Ibrahim!

762
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,240
What's happening?

763
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,520
Somebody answer me!

764
00:55:58,600 --> 00:55:59,600
Wow.

765
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:03,040
What delicious lentil soup.
What a great chef.

766
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:04,960
Nothing's missing

767
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,320
just a clove of garlic

768
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,000
a pinch of salt

769
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,000
and a squeeze of lemon.

770
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,520
Where to...

771
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:14,840
to the garbage bin!

772
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:19,640
God damn you,
this is diarrhea soup!

773
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:24,160
You really love that woman
you're always calling?

774
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:28,200
Please, Ahmad, don't poke my wounds.

775
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,360
Don't remind me of her.

776
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,800
You're head over heels.
You call her a lot!

777
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:38,280
I call her at any chance I get.

778
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:43,600
She's completely in love with me!

779
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,200
Then marry her!

780
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:48,640
When I get released.
I'm waiting for the pardon.

781
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,600
Which one is he?

782
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,360
The second one to the right, sir.

783
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,680
Fine. Please follow me.

784
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,680
Mor, you never told me what you're in for.

785
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,040
Spying.

786
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:26,040
Why are you sunbathing with the frauds?

787
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:30,800
Leave me alone. I can't get her
voice out of my head.

788
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,280
Looks like you're head over heels!

789
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,800
Why doesn't she visit you?

790
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:39,840
I wish...

791
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,440
I'm sure her family won't let her.

792
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:48,600
- Don't you want to see her?
- Please find me a way!

793
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:50,200
What's up, guys?

794
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:52,440
The whole country's naked
inside and outside!

795
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:53,880
But, outside, people are hairless!

796
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,200
Ahmad, your cousin rotted while
waiting for you.

797
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:04,360
Forget about him.
Come sunbathe with us.

798
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:05,360
Sunbathe?

799
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,536
You can call this wheat bathing

800
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:09,360
or sweat bathing, hair bathing.

801
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,720
Whatever. Just come.

802
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,240
Give us a break.

803
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:16,000
Give you a break?
Mor, what's all this beauty?

804
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:19,800
What a beautiful sight! Where were
you hiding this silky white skin?

805
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:22,960
Just come, relax, you're always tense.

806
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:26,120
I would've joined if it wasn't a slumber.

807
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,760
I'll put on my one-piece swimsuit
and come back.

808
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,320
Get naked.

809
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:45,600
Politicians in Custody for Fraud Win
Seats in Parliamentary Elections

810
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,320
Technology is amazing!

811
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:19,800
With this tiny dongle...

812
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:22,240
you can connect to the internet
and see anything in Jordan.

813
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:26,000
That's enough now,
take it to the safe department!

814
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:27,840
How do you create a Facebook account?

815
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,960
What, Facebook now? Enough!

816
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,520
Let me be just a little while longer.

817
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:38,440
Always in a hurry!

818
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,920
Who has some extra bread?

819
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,040
Who has extra bread?

820
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:47,920
What the hell?

821
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,760
Are we in Somalia!?

822
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,280
I need bread, not a blood unit!

823
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,480
Come here.

824
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:55,560
Why didn't you say something earlier,
you heard me asking for the past hour.

825
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:58,840
Speak up! Say I have some.

826
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:01,400
You stole a 100,000
and you're looking for a loaf?

827
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:04,800
You talk as if you stole a million!

828
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,240
You're an old man with grey hair...

829
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:11,000
and thick glasses in jail for 1800 Dinars.

830
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:13,360
You should be ashamed of yourself.

831
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,840
In this country,
the only way is to hit and run.

832
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,160
You're a man if you don't get caught.

833
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:21,720
But you got caught.

834
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:25,240
You think they were smart enough
to catch me? It's my damn wife's fault.

835
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:26,600
I hope I get rid of her.

836
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:30,720
From trust comes betrayal.

837
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,160
The end of a...

838
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,320
A betrayed man, my dear!

839
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:43,920
Dance with me!

840
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,520
Guys, let's hear some noise!

841
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:51,320
Jaloul, come. It's an orphanage over here!

842
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:25,040
Cell W6! Attention!

843
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:33,680
The cell is ready for inspection, sir.

844
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:39,760
How are you today? Need anything?

845
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,400
Everything is fine, sir.

846
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:43,600
But I have family issues.

847
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:49,000
I'm desperate for a call
to solve the issue, if you please.

848
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:52,000
This is not fair, sir.

849
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:55,320
He always makes calls.
We all have families too!

850
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,760
We all want to make phone calls.

851
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,480
That's true, sir.

852
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:03,080
There will be no calls for you this time.

853
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:04,760
Yes, sir.

854
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:08,160
- Let 10 men make calls.
- Yes, sir.

855
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:09,840
Any other requests?

856
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,440
Sir, the food is a bit salty.

857
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:16,080
Is that all?

858
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:19,080
- Get the kitchen to cut down on salt.
- Yes, sir.

859
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,680
Jaloul...

860
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:36,600
You owe me 18 Dinars from 3 months ago.

861
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,520
Let's see if I get money today.

862
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:42,360
I want the cash.

863
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:45,000
- I'll see what I can do.
- Find a way.

864
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:50,520
- Excuse me.
- What?

865
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,360
You owe me 35 Dinars.

866
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:57,400
Don't forget this time.

867
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:00,120
35? Do they hatch and multiply?

868
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:01,560
Details are here!

869
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:06,040
- Your whole shop isn't worth 35 Dinars.
- Everything is written here.

870
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:07,000
Find a way.

871
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:08,680
- Yeah, whatever!
- Find a way!

872
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:11,800
Ahmad, come here.

873
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,880
- Please do me a favor.
- What?

874
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:20,360
Keep an eye on Jaloul and Dead Man.

875
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,520
See if they receive money during visits.

876
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:23,960
Sure, don't worry.

877
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,960
Watch them closely.

878
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:28,440
I'll be on them like a hawk!

879
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:30,680
- I'll have a treat for you.
- I'll let you know.

880
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,000
God bless you.

881
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:39,560
Hello.

882
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,120
How's my little Nasnoos?

883
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,560
She sends her regards.

884
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,680
Will you be home next week?

885
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:53,160
Your cousin did nothing to get you out.

886
01:03:55,520 --> 01:04:00,040
I borrowed money
from our neighbors' market.

887
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:02,800
They let me take groceries for free.

888
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:07,640
Not completely free, but till you get out.

889
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:11,840
They'll wait till you get back
on your feet,

890
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,600
but they won't wait forever.

891
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:19,160
And the girls need new school uniforms.

892
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:23,160
Electricity bills Ahmad...

893
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:35,560
Welcome our hero!

894
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:43,400
Come on, cousin.

895
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:45,720
You really thought I'd forget about you?

896
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:53,040
3 minutes and you'll slip away forever.

897
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:32,440
Cousin, I really don't know what to say.

898
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:37,280
Don't say a damn thing!
You ruined my life!

899
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:39,040
I'm still stuck in here!

900
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:42,160
I swear a guy stole all the laptops
except for one.

901
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:45,240
You deserve it!

902
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,760
You should be here! Not me!

903
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:50,880
I'm so sorry.
I'll pick up the last laptop tomorrow.

904
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,400
When you get out,
I'll pay all that I owe you.

905
01:05:56,280 --> 01:06:01,200
Did Jaloul and Dead Man
get money at the visit?

906
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:03,800
I'm sure they did!
They get visitors everyday

907
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:06,600
Did you see them receiving money?

908
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:08,280
Listen, Mor...

909
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,600
it's not a matter of receiving money
or not.

910
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:13,240
They just don't want to pay.

911
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:18,680
I think they don't take you
seriously anymore.

912
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:22,200
I have the same feeling. You're right.

913
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,400
If I were you, I'd remind them
who is the boss here.

914
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:28,640
Act quickly before you end up
with nothing.

915
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:30,480
You think so?

916
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,160
That's what I think.

917
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,760
You owe me 7 Dinars from last month.

918
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:49,040
Pay me, I've had it with you.
Get me the money.

919
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:50,760
Ok.

920
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:53,320
Sir.

921
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,080
You owe me 35 Dinars

922
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,400
Pay them now and I'll close your account

923
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:01,040
and won't deal with you anymore.

924
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:03,016
I'm the one who doesn't
want to deal with you.

925
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:05,280
Please close my Swiss account!

926
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:09,280
Watch your mouth, and pay what you owe.

927
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:13,440
You watch your mouth, and don't shout.

928
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:16,760
Who do you think you are?

929
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:18,680
You're nothing

930
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:22,800
You're worthless,
you're dead in the first place.

931
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:26,960
I'll pay you back and give you
a slipper on top of them.

932
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:30,200
- Leave me!
- Calm down.

933
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:31,440
Today's your end.

934
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,840
I should've beaten you up a long time ago.

935
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,560
Come here, you bastard.

936
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:39,760
I'm going to squash you.

937
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:43,800
I'll have you for breakfast!

938
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:49,200
Kick his ass, he deserves it.

939
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:50,560
I'll teach you all a lesson.

940
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:53,960
I'm your boss whether you like it or not!

941
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:00,760
Welcome back!

942
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:02,440
Thanks. You're here?

943
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:03,960
Of course, where would I be?

944
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:06,120
You were out for 2 months only,
why are you back?

945
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:07,680
I came to relax for a while.

946
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:10,320
Relax all you want.
You just missed a fight!

947
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:46,600
Old man, get up!

948
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:50,279
Bis, get up. The shop.

949
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,319
Wake up!

950
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,439
Ahmad, get up!

951
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:02,520
You haven't smoked in a month!
Move it.

952
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:28,520
What are you bastards doing?

953
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:31,279
What's happening? Bastards!

954
01:09:32,359 --> 01:09:34,680
Our beloved Mor, our darling Mor.

955
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:37,560
The best shop, that once was a shop.

956
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:43,279
Let's hear, the robbery!

957
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:43,680
Listen

958
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,520
If you need a job once you're out,
I'll find you one.

959
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:50,200
I'm not blessed with honest money,
how about with dishonest?

960
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,360
Dishonest?

961
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:54,680
You think I was born a fraud?

962
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:58,200
My first time in jail,
I was falsely accused.

963
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:01,680
Aren't you tired of this life?

964
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,880
I tried and I am not supposed
to be here now.

965
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,280
It's my wife's fault!

966
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:12,640
She got me tracked from the new internet
connection she got.

967
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:14,040
Damn that dongle!

968
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:17,040
Like an idiot, I got her a new laptop!

969
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:21,240
Don't even mention laptops.

970
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:24,000
They ruined my life.

971
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,800
Look at me, I'm here cleaning rice!

972
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:32,160
I got a golden opportunity,
10 new laptops, I couldn't resist!

973
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:33,840
10 laptops?

974
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:37,920
The idiot imported them from Canada.

975
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:43,680
God damn you! You screwed me over!

976
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:48,440
What's wrong, guys?
Calm down, Ahmad.

977
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:54,880
- What's wrong?
- He's stole the laptops from my cousin!

978
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:58,120
- Calm down, guys.
- Calm down.

979
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:25,560
Here's your tea.

980
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:28,120
Get the hell out of here!

981
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,400
- I don't want tea.
- Fine, don't drink it!

982
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:31,520
Get out of here!

983
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:53,280
What's up with you?
You didn't go to the yard today.

984
01:12:57,720 --> 01:12:59,320
Come on, Mor, cheer up!

985
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:03,320
The Holy land has been taken
and no one got upset

986
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:04,880
and you're upset about a tiny shop?

987
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,000
- Hello.
- Welcome.

988
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:17,080
Sir, I'm here for my laptop.

989
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:19,680
Come in a week.

990
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:22,280
Why after a week?
I am sure you have the laptop.

991
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:24,400
It's in the safe department.

992
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:27,480
Look? All these are robbery
inventory files and this takes time.

993
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:30,600
Please help me.
I can't keep running around.

994
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:32,240
The officer told me I'll take it today.

995
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:36,360
Come back in 3 days.
This is a personal favor to you.

996
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:37,800
Leave now.

997
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:42,320
Don't huff and puff. Leave!

998
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:43,680
We have work to do!

999
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:39,680
Ahmad Taher Farraj.

1000
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:41,360
You're released.

1001
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:50,280
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE MOR, OUR LEADER.
CELL W6, AHMAD

1002
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:02,080
Will you help me finish building
the room on my roof?

1003
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:08,000
Buy the materials
and I won't charge you for my fee.

1004
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,800
How about you buy the materials
and I'll pay you back in installments.

1005
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:16,320
Of course not?
That way I'll be plowing on a rooster!

1006
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:19,280
Then I'll leave them as they are!

1007
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:21,240
How are you?

1008
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:25,160
I remember what you used to do
to our teacher in school?

1009
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:29,280
Look at you now, you became a mayor!
I didn't expect you'll become a mayor.

1010
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:31,760
I'm still aiming for even higher ranks!

1011
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:35,680
Your biggest ambition was to be
a mechanic or a car electrician.

1012
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:37,760
I have no idea how you became mayor!

1013
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:41,360
- Remember the good old days?
- Of course I do!

1014
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:50,240
- Ahmad Taher Farraj.
- Yes, sir.

1015
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:54,280
You and the likes of you
are ruining our country.

1016
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:57,720
I'm giving you 3 months probation.

1017
01:16:58,480 --> 01:16:59,800
I didn't ruin anything.

1018
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:03,200
I know a man in prison if he gets out
he'll ruin the country!

1019
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:07,760
Get the hell out of my face!

1020
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:22,200
Stop. Give me your hands.

1021
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:25,200
Why? I got released!

1022
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:29,200
I have to hand you back to the station
I received you from

1023
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:32,040
and from there you can go home.

1024
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:34,400
It'll take an hour
and you'll go back home.

1025
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:37,160
Why are you in a hurry? We're having fun.

1026
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:39,240
- Ok.
- Ok?

1027
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:34,440
What are you guys in for?

1028
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:37,480
National security.

1029
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:41,080
Sir?

1030
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,000
I should be transferred under minimum
security, why am I with them?

1031
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:47,440
You're right, but they are on our way!

1032
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:55,440
Hello.

1033
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:57,080
Yes.

1034
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,160
Raise your voice!

1035
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:03,920
Raise your voice!

1036
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,000
What?

1037
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:09,120
Hello.

1038
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:12,520
Hello.

1039
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:14,360
What?

1040
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:15,720
What did you say?

1041
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:23,640
Guys, please put on your handcuffs
before we get to the station.

1042
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:30,680
Hello.

1043
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:34,320
Raise your voice!

1044
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:37,760
What did you say?

1045
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:42,120
Is he mad because you took off your cuffs?

1046
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:46,960
No, we always do this, we want to smoke.

1047
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:48,800
I'm on my way.

1048
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:50,800
Don't touch a thing.

1049
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:52,880
Damn, I'm screwed!

1050
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:57,200
I'm screwed!

1051
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:58,680
Are you ok?

1052
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:01,520
How can I be ok? My house got robbed!

1053
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:04,400
Oh, Salem! You're screwed!
