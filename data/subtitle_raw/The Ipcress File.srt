1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,195
Thank you.

2
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:59,421
- Just these.
- Right.

3
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:04,019
- What train, sir?
- 7:55 to Nottingham.

4
00:01:06,464 --> 00:01:09,817
- There's a reservation for Dr Radcliffe.
- Yes, sir.

5
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:16,450
'The 7:55 express
leaving platform 13

6
00:01:16,536 --> 00:01:22,844
'will stop at Rugby, Leicester,
Nottingham and Sheffield.'

7
00:01:36,556 --> 00:01:39,670
- Thank you very much indeed.
- Thank you, sir.

8
00:01:42,071 --> 00:01:44,025
- All right?
- Yes, thank you.

9
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,654
Well, have a good holiday,
and Henderson will meet you.

10
00:01:47,745 --> 00:01:49,894
- Yes. Yes.
- Right. Bye.

11
00:01:49,986 --> 00:01:52,620
'... leaving platform 13

12
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:58,566
'will stop at Rugby, Leicester,
Nottingham and Sheffield.'

13
00:02:03,173 --> 00:02:05,126
All aboard.

14
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:14,640
Dr Radcliffe, you forgot your camera?

15
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,793
Where's Dr Radcliffe?

16
00:06:57,381 --> 00:06:59,334
Morning.

17
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:09,881
You should get up in the morning.
20 minutes late you are, you know.

18
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,766
- Anything new?
- It's all in the report.

19
00:07:14,646 --> 00:07:17,032
And it's neat and tidy - unlike some.

20
00:07:17,122 --> 00:07:20,270
You ought to remember
you're still in the army, boyo.

21
00:07:20,358 --> 00:07:22,994
I'll tell you what, you remember for me.

22
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:41,933
9:45am, postal delivery.

23
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:47,169
The postman was your man Haggerty,
delivered two packets and four letters.

24
00:07:47,256 --> 00:07:50,289
9:56am, the baker's van called.

25
00:07:50,372 --> 00:07:53,089
Left two large brown and a sliced white.

26
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:55,123
They had an extra pint of milk

27
00:07:55,207 --> 00:07:59,718
which either means there are more
people there or they're drinking more tea.

28
00:08:02,922 --> 00:08:06,467
What are you doing here?
You're not due on for hours yet.

29
00:08:06,557 --> 00:08:10,866
Ross wants you. So old muggins here
has to come down and relieve you.

30
00:08:10,952 --> 00:08:13,748
- What does he want? Did he tell you?
- No.

31
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:16,818
Didn't he say anything?

32
00:08:16,907 --> 00:08:19,340
Yes. I'm in his full confidence, I am.

33
00:08:20,346 --> 00:08:22,857
Blast you and blast old Ross.

34
00:08:24,221 --> 00:08:26,175
- You know what?
- No, what?

35
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:31,692
You've got some wiping to do -
that tape's still running. Good morning.

36
00:09:00,386 --> 00:09:02,342
- Morning.
- Morning, sir.

37
00:09:06,263 --> 00:09:08,217
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

38
00:09:15,692 --> 00:09:17,647
Come on, little pigeons.

39
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:30,787
Come in, Palmer.

40
00:09:34,317 --> 00:09:37,987
- Sergeant Palmer reporting as ordered.
- Close the door.

41
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:55,689
And don't slouch into my office
like a pregnant camel. Stand to attention.

42
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,551
At ease.

43
00:10:19,633 --> 00:10:21,588
Is that my B-107, sir?

44
00:10:21,673 --> 00:10:23,899
As if you didn't know.

45
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,343
And it makes awful reading, Palmer.

46
00:10:26,427 --> 00:10:28,542
You just love the army, don't you?

47
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:31,091
Oh, yes, sir. I just love the army, sir.

48
00:10:32,782 --> 00:10:35,851
We may find you a better audience
for your jokes.

49
00:10:35,939 --> 00:10:40,009
- I'm transferring you to Major Dalby.
- Oh. What will be my job, sir?

50
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:44,803
It could give your peculiar talents
more scope than observation duties.

51
00:10:44,891 --> 00:10:49,325
- At least you won't be stuck in an attic.
- Er, is this a promotion, sir?

52
00:10:50,925 --> 00:10:53,119
- Sort of.
- Any more money?

53
00:10:54,203 --> 00:10:57,556
Let's see.
You're on 1300 pay and allowances.

54
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:59,913
Yes, sir.

55
00:10:59,996 --> 00:11:02,872
- I'll try and get you 1400.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

56
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:06,627
- Now I can get that new infrared grill.
- Save your money.

57
00:11:06,711 --> 00:11:10,019
You won't have much time for cooking.
Dalby works his men.

58
00:11:10,107 --> 00:11:12,221
And he doesn't have
my sense of humour.

59
00:11:12,306 --> 00:11:14,580
Yes, sir. I will miss that, sir.

60
00:11:16,423 --> 00:11:19,332
All right, come on, I'll take you over.

61
00:11:19,421 --> 00:11:22,250
Er, the B-107, must that go with us?

62
00:11:23,496 --> 00:11:25,450
I'm afraid so.

63
00:11:35,006 --> 00:11:36,880
Come along, Palmer.

64
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,697
...to take any old job...

65
00:11:56,065 --> 00:11:58,020
...no, not weekends.

66
00:11:58,104 --> 00:12:00,139
Oh. Good morning, sir.

67
00:12:00,222 --> 00:12:04,416
The butler you asked for
is upstairs waiting to be interviewed.

68
00:12:04,499 --> 00:12:07,966
Just go through the door,
along the passage and up the stairs.

69
00:12:08,054 --> 00:12:11,009
- Got it?
- Er, yes, thank you.

70
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,636
Do you mind waiting?

71
00:12:16,687 --> 00:12:18,641
Sir.

72
00:12:18,725 --> 00:12:22,921
...I don't think I'm difficult,
it's just these jobs.

73
00:12:23,002 --> 00:12:25,196
Well, I mean...

74
00:12:38,587 --> 00:12:40,815
Good morning, Dalby.

75
00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:48,052
- Good morning sir.
- I've just read your T-104.

76
00:12:48,138 --> 00:12:50,648
I thought that might speed your arrival.

77
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:53,010
It did.

78
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,723
It's a pity you lost Radcliffe.

79
00:13:04,044 --> 00:13:06,237
We were expecting something like that.

80
00:13:06,322 --> 00:13:08,914
I hope you're not imputing negligence.

81
00:13:08,998 --> 00:13:12,351
My dear chap,
there's no question of that.

82
00:13:16,471 --> 00:13:18,664
Let me put you in the picture, Dalby.

83
00:13:18,749 --> 00:13:23,102
The killing of Radcliffe's guard
has verified our suspicions.

84
00:13:23,185 --> 00:13:27,222
For some time we've had a section
investigating the brain drain.

85
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,765
Too many government scientists
are leaving their jobs

86
00:13:31,856 --> 00:13:35,291
at the peak of their careers -
they cease to function.

87
00:13:35,374 --> 00:13:40,284
- You've checked on them, of course?
- Naturally. We checked on them all.

88
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:45,245
126 have left in the past two years.

89
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:49,632
107 had fair enough reasons to go -
better facilities, better pay.

90
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:53,510
Three defected to the other side.

91
00:13:53,597 --> 00:13:57,552
- And the other 16?
- 17 with Radcliffe. 17 top men.

92
00:13:58,593 --> 00:14:00,741
What defies probability

93
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:04,183
is that none of them
had a rational explanation for quitting.

94
00:14:04,268 --> 00:14:06,223
But Radcliffe didn't quit.

95
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:09,613
- He was lifted.
- Exactly.

96
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:16,255
Now we think
we've got our first real lead.

97
00:14:17,935 --> 00:14:20,446
And I want you to get Radcliffe back.

98
00:14:21,972 --> 00:14:24,927
- I'll try, of course.
- That's not good enough.

99
00:14:25,008 --> 00:14:29,840
If you don't get him back, the people
upstairs might have to close you down.

100
00:14:29,923 --> 00:14:32,038
Now wait a minute.

101
00:14:32,123 --> 00:14:35,192
This department was set up
for counterespionage

102
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:38,664
not security grade one surveillance
on people like Radcliffe.

103
00:14:38,756 --> 00:14:41,985
Neither were Wilson's
or Roberts's departments

104
00:14:42,072 --> 00:14:44,062
but I put them on S1 duties.

105
00:14:44,151 --> 00:14:46,343
They were War Office, I'm Home Office.

106
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:48,542
I'm aware of that, Dalby.

107
00:14:48,628 --> 00:14:50,582
I set you up, remember?

108
00:14:50,665 --> 00:14:53,971
You have a very good job
for a passed-over major, haven't you?

109
00:14:57,417 --> 00:14:59,373
Hm.

110
00:15:01,055 --> 00:15:04,010
I've brought you
a replacement for Taylor.

111
00:15:04,093 --> 00:15:06,322
Hm?

112
00:15:06,411 --> 00:15:08,399
What's he like?

113
00:15:08,489 --> 00:15:12,000
A little insubordinate but a good man.
Sergeant Palmer.

114
00:15:12,844 --> 00:15:15,800
- That's it, Mrs Norman.
- It's not much.

115
00:15:15,882 --> 00:15:19,233
After doing Lyons Corner House
you can't expect me to clean a pub.

116
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,751
- It's a good hotel.
- I don't know.

117
00:15:21,836 --> 00:15:25,508
I'd do better at the labour exchange.

118
00:15:25,593 --> 00:15:27,741
Yes, sir? You can go up now.

119
00:15:30,428 --> 00:15:32,383
Good luck, Palmer.

120
00:15:32,467 --> 00:15:34,420
And don't forget your mop.

121
00:15:34,504 --> 00:15:36,493
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning.

122
00:15:36,582 --> 00:15:39,937
Through the door,
along the passage and up the stairs.

123
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:41,972
Got it!

124
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,285
Shut the door.

125
00:16:23,979 --> 00:16:28,093
It isn't usual to read a B-107
to its subject, Palmer,

126
00:16:28,175 --> 00:16:30,163
but I'm going to put you straight.

127
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,725
"Insubordinate,

128
00:16:36,648 --> 00:16:38,602
"insolent...

129
00:16:39,564 --> 00:16:42,633
"and a trickster...

130
00:16:42,724 --> 00:16:45,677
"perhaps with criminal tendencies. "

131
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,317
Yes, that's a pretty fair appraisal.

132
00:16:48,397 --> 00:16:50,432
- Sir.
- Good.

133
00:16:50,515 --> 00:16:52,867
That last quality might be useful.

134
00:16:54,391 --> 00:16:58,348
But if I have any trouble with you,
I shall bite you, Palmer,

135
00:16:58,427 --> 00:17:02,974
and I shall bite you so hard you'll go
right back to where Ross found you.

136
00:17:07,698 --> 00:17:09,652
Come with me.

137
00:17:13,295 --> 00:17:15,283
A word in your shell-like ear.

138
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:20,122
If there's anything
to be reported to Ross, I report it.

139
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,558
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

140
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:38,738
Thank you for a wonderful evening.

141
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:44,098
Spare us the jokes, Palmer, I don't have
Colonel Ross's sense of humour.

142
00:17:44,184 --> 00:17:45,935
Yes, I will miss that, sir.

143
00:17:47,143 --> 00:17:50,652
The fella whose job I'm taking,
will he show me the ropes?

144
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:54,888
- Only if you're in touch with the spirits.
- I beg your pardon?

145
00:17:56,653 --> 00:17:58,607
He was shot this morning.

146
00:18:04,887 --> 00:18:07,078
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning.

147
00:18:07,163 --> 00:18:08,753
Morning, sir.

148
00:18:37,257 --> 00:18:38,929
Murray.

149
00:18:41,452 --> 00:18:42,965
Palmer.

150
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,800
- Hi.
- Hi.

151
00:18:44,887 --> 00:18:46,843
Give him your gun.

152
00:18:49,804 --> 00:18:51,758
Issue him with a Colt. 32.

153
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:18,813
- Do you know how to use this?
- Colt. 32? Yes.

154
00:19:18,898 --> 00:19:21,729
- I'd sooner have my automatic.
- Use the Colt.

155
00:19:21,815 --> 00:19:23,768
I'll use the Colt.

156
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:29,247
- Morning, sir.
- Good morning.

157
00:19:32,325 --> 00:19:34,439
- Morning, sir.
- Good morning.

158
00:19:37,881 --> 00:19:39,029
Morning.

159
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,154
- Thank you.
- Here's the file on Bluejay, sir.

160
00:19:42,238 --> 00:19:45,542
- You won't need that.
- No... Oh, come in, Palmer.

161
00:19:47,072 --> 00:19:50,027
Yes, I understand. I see.

162
00:19:54,146 --> 00:19:57,896
I'll be going down there.
Yes, if you will.

163
00:19:59,221 --> 00:20:02,336
Oh, yes.
Excuse me.

164
00:20:09,012 --> 00:20:11,603
Did you go over there last night?

165
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,644
How did it turn out?

166
00:20:19,241 --> 00:20:23,516
This morning our S1, Radcliffe,
was lifted and Taylor killed.

167
00:20:25,037 --> 00:20:28,549
It has been put to me
that if we don't get Radcliffe back,

168
00:20:28,635 --> 00:20:31,101
this department will be closed down.

169
00:20:31,193 --> 00:20:33,260
Message received and understood.

170
00:20:34,868 --> 00:20:36,142
Palmer.

171
00:20:36,227 --> 00:20:38,863
This is Palmer, Taylor's replacement.

172
00:20:39,782 --> 00:20:41,737
Chilcott-Oakes.

173
00:20:41,821 --> 00:20:43,891
- Hello.
- Carswell.

174
00:20:43,979 --> 00:20:46,649
Gray, Edwards and Courtney.

175
00:20:48,177 --> 00:20:50,688
You know Alice, of course. Now, then...

176
00:20:50,772 --> 00:20:52,966
Oh, you may sit down.

177
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:56,044
There are only two people in Europe

178
00:20:56,128 --> 00:20:59,277
operating on a scale large enough
to market Radcliffe.

179
00:20:59,366 --> 00:21:03,481
One, codenamed Sparrow,
whom I've just been told by the French Sûreté,

180
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:07,153
was arrested two months ago
and they're still holding.

181
00:21:07,236 --> 00:21:11,272
So, we are left with Erik Ashley Grantby,

182
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:14,980
codename Bluejay, born Albania 1918.

183
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,465
Thank you, Chico.

184
00:21:24,343 --> 00:21:26,900
The one in the hat is Bluejay,

185
00:21:26,979 --> 00:21:31,412
the bald one is his chief of staff,
codenamed Housemartin.

186
00:21:33,136 --> 00:21:36,329
This was taken in Stockholm
two years ago.

187
00:21:39,609 --> 00:21:43,961
Here is a more recent film of Bluejay
in Vienna last October.

188
00:21:46,761 --> 00:21:49,877
Since then, it would appear,
he's been lying low.

189
00:21:52,596 --> 00:21:58,189
Alice has done a breakdown of all
his known haunts in and around London.

190
00:21:58,271 --> 00:22:00,260
I want them all checked.

191
00:22:00,349 --> 00:22:02,737
- Jock, take these.
- Sir.

192
00:22:02,827 --> 00:22:04,782
- Gray.
- Sir.

193
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,014
- Edwards.
- Sir.

194
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:09,057
- Chico.
- Thank you, sir.

195
00:22:10,101 --> 00:22:12,054
Palmer.

196
00:22:12,896 --> 00:22:17,044
Lastly, if Bluejay has Radcliffe,
he'll sell to the highest bidder

197
00:22:17,133 --> 00:22:19,088
and that's got to be us.

198
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:23,241
Whoever contacts him must let him
know that we're in the market.

199
00:22:23,329 --> 00:22:27,318
Right, get on with it.
Courtney, I'd like a word with you.

200
00:22:33,239 --> 00:22:35,909
I say, er, my name's Harry.

201
00:22:35,996 --> 00:22:37,951
- I'm Jock.
- Hi.

202
00:22:38,035 --> 00:22:40,070
- Is that his bird?
- No!

203
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:44,823
Oh. That parade-ground manner of his
doesn't work with women.

204
00:22:44,908 --> 00:22:47,738
- He gave you the treatment, eh?
- I'll say.

205
00:22:47,826 --> 00:22:52,053
He does that to everyone.
Still, he's not a bad bloke really.

206
00:22:58,136 --> 00:22:59,612
Go ahead.

207
00:22:59,695 --> 00:23:01,888
This'll be your desk.

208
00:23:10,486 --> 00:23:12,793
- Don't smoke a pipe, do you?
- No.

209
00:23:12,883 --> 00:23:14,950
Mr Taylor was scared of cancer.

210
00:23:16,758 --> 00:23:19,191
Combined clearing house reports,

211
00:23:19,277 --> 00:23:23,789
your equipment requisitions,
expense allowance indent,

212
00:23:23,871 --> 00:23:26,986
motor pool chit - yours is a blue Zodiac.

213
00:23:28,108 --> 00:23:33,301
Log book, insurance,
civilian driving licence and form L-101.

214
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:42,375
What is form L-101?

215
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:45,843
Field report. You have
to make one out after every job.

216
00:23:45,933 --> 00:23:47,887
It makes Dalby happy.

217
00:23:47,971 --> 00:23:50,960
I've got to ask about Grantby
in 19 different places

218
00:23:51,046 --> 00:23:53,354
and then make out 19 silly answers?

219
00:23:53,446 --> 00:23:57,321
That's about it, laddie.
This job's nearly all legwork.

220
00:24:12,468 --> 00:24:16,504
It may be Dalby's way of doing things
but it isn't mine.

221
00:24:16,584 --> 00:24:18,732
- See you, Jock.
- Aye, cheerio.

222
00:24:49,633 --> 00:24:51,191
I'm always doing you favours.

223
00:24:51,272 --> 00:24:54,227
- We're mates.
- How about doing me a favour for once?

224
00:24:54,308 --> 00:24:56,820
Sure, Pat. I'd do anything for you.

225
00:24:56,907 --> 00:24:59,418
- Afternoon, Inspector.
- Afternoon.

226
00:24:59,504 --> 00:25:02,811
- What's his name again?
- Erik Ashley Grantby.

227
00:25:02,902 --> 00:25:06,255
- See what we've got.
- You've got a green card on him.

228
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:08,292
Won't take a moment, sir.

229
00:25:10,853 --> 00:25:13,206
- Now...
- Yes?

230
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:16,166
That blonde bird
you was with the other evening.

231
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:18,396
- Rita?
- What's her phone number?

232
00:25:18,486 --> 00:25:20,395
You dirty old man.

233
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:23,394
Well, you scratch my back
and I'll scratch hers.

234
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:26,276
- You ought to be locked up.
- I know.

235
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:28,427
- Here we are, sir.
- Thank you.

236
00:25:30,435 --> 00:25:35,140
Ah... Grantby. A right master criminal.

237
00:25:36,189 --> 00:25:39,974
Well, there you are, Harry.
Scrutinise that.

238
00:25:46,861 --> 00:25:48,850
Three parking tickets.

239
00:25:48,938 --> 00:25:50,654
Thurlow Gardens.

240
00:25:51,818 --> 00:25:53,771
Thurlow Gardens.

241
00:25:54,814 --> 00:25:56,769
Thurlow Gardens.

242
00:25:56,852 --> 00:25:58,885
The last one only two weeks ago.

243
00:25:59,968 --> 00:26:02,638
Ah! Registration number.

244
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:05,595
- Can I borrow that?
- Go ahead.

245
00:26:05,683 --> 00:26:09,149
Four-one-seven...

246
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:12,314
F- L-U.

247
00:26:13,597 --> 00:26:17,427
- Thank you, Pat.
- What about her telephone number?

248
00:26:17,512 --> 00:26:20,025
Oh! Disconnected.

249
00:29:08,274 --> 00:29:12,822
Get me Wilson's Metal Fatigue
And Stress Engineering.

250
00:29:12,911 --> 00:29:15,423
Yes, certainly.

251
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:38,838
Mr Grantby?

252
00:29:42,804 --> 00:29:48,555
Mr Grantby, we are looking for an
important piece of scientific equipment.

253
00:29:48,638 --> 00:29:50,593
It was lost on a train.

254
00:29:53,354 --> 00:29:56,422
We think that you might
be able to help us get it back.

255
00:30:02,503 --> 00:30:03,981
Shh.

256
00:30:13,815 --> 00:30:16,373
We would be willing to do a deal.

257
00:30:32,199 --> 00:30:34,346
Call me, after six.

258
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:21,591
Operator, I'm getting unobtainable
on Knightsbridge 2149,

259
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:23,944
could you check it for me, please?

260
00:31:24,031 --> 00:31:26,589
'That line is discontinued, caller. '

261
00:31:37,697 --> 00:31:40,163
Grantby.

262
00:32:35,124 --> 00:32:37,079
Right, gentlemen, sit down.

263
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,349
All right, let's hear what you have to say.

264
00:32:43,438 --> 00:32:45,153
Carswell?

265
00:32:46,235 --> 00:32:48,302
Er, no luck sir, I drew a blank.

266
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:54,258
- Chico?
- No joy at all. I'm awfully sorry, sir.

267
00:32:54,346 --> 00:32:58,699
There's no use being sorry, is there?
Didn't anyone contact him?

268
00:32:58,783 --> 00:33:00,737
Er, I did.

269
00:33:03,218 --> 00:33:05,605
In the Science Museum library.

270
00:33:06,496 --> 00:33:07,723
And?

271
00:33:07,814 --> 00:33:10,963
All he gave me
was a discontinued telephone number.

272
00:33:11,051 --> 00:33:13,439
- Did you follow him?
- Yes, and I lost him.

273
00:33:13,529 --> 00:33:16,564
- You lost him?
- Yes.

274
00:33:16,648 --> 00:33:20,397
You idiot. Let's see it.

275
00:33:28,596 --> 00:33:31,154
All right, put it on your report.

276
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:37,824
I want your L-101 s as quickly as
possible, however feeble they may be.

277
00:33:37,907 --> 00:33:42,055
And then you can all get out
and start looking for Grantby again.

278
00:33:42,143 --> 00:33:43,496
Alice.

279
00:33:46,978 --> 00:33:50,887
Don't worry, man, you were the only one
to come up with anything.

280
00:33:50,973 --> 00:33:54,849
- He seemed very pleased.
- He's got a comical way of showing it.

281
00:35:27,445 --> 00:35:31,991
- You know this is unauthorised?
- My mother gave it to me for Christmas.

282
00:35:33,321 --> 00:35:35,787
You're supposed to be at work.

283
00:35:36,876 --> 00:35:39,149
Oh, you are, of course?

284
00:35:40,635 --> 00:35:43,428
Dalby likes to know about his new boys.

285
00:36:01,853 --> 00:36:05,637
- Have you seen everything?
- Yes, thank you.

286
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,878
Then you know where the...

287
00:36:07,969 --> 00:36:09,957
whisky is.

288
00:36:11,045 --> 00:36:14,240
- Yes.
- Fix us both one, will you?

289
00:36:52,366 --> 00:36:53,958
Thank you.

290
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:57,079
Cheers.

291
00:37:01,399 --> 00:37:03,354
Do you like music?

292
00:37:03,437 --> 00:37:06,187
- Yes.
- Why don't you put a record on?

293
00:37:06,276 --> 00:37:07,672
Mozart.

294
00:37:14,508 --> 00:37:16,461
Music to cook by!

295
00:37:34,808 --> 00:37:37,399
What are you gonna tell Dalby
in your L-101?

296
00:37:37,485 --> 00:37:39,439
That you like girls.

297
00:37:39,524 --> 00:37:41,559
You got that right.

298
00:37:41,642 --> 00:37:44,392
You're not the tearaway
he thinks you are.

299
00:37:44,479 --> 00:37:47,550
You also like books, music, cooking.

300
00:37:47,638 --> 00:37:49,626
I like birds best.

301
00:37:51,354 --> 00:37:54,387
- How did you get into this game?
- My husband was in it.

302
00:37:56,428 --> 00:37:58,381
He was killed in Tokyo.

303
00:37:59,305 --> 00:38:00,861
I'm sorry.

304
00:38:03,421 --> 00:38:05,569
So they gave me a job.

305
00:38:05,661 --> 00:38:08,252
You were bailed out
of detention barracks.

306
00:38:08,337 --> 00:38:10,291
Yes, I was.

307
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:13,603
- So what bailed you in?
- Er...

308
00:38:13,692 --> 00:38:15,761
I was stationed in Berlin

309
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:19,443
and I was making rather a lot of money
out of the German army

310
00:38:19,528 --> 00:38:23,278
and they insisted that the British army
made an example of me.

311
00:38:23,363 --> 00:38:26,034
- What did you do?
- It's very complicated.

312
00:38:26,122 --> 00:38:29,236
- It impressed Ross.
- It impressed me.

313
00:38:29,318 --> 00:38:31,989
Boy, has he got me
by the short hairs for it.

314
00:38:32,996 --> 00:38:37,428
Still, it's better than two years in the nick.
The food's terrible.

315
00:38:44,664 --> 00:38:48,018
- You're very professional.
- Yeah, so are you.

316
00:38:50,979 --> 00:38:52,888
Do you need all that?

317
00:38:52,978 --> 00:38:55,330
It's as easy to cook for two
as it is for one.

318
00:38:55,415 --> 00:38:57,369
I thought you might join me.

319
00:38:58,492 --> 00:39:02,037
No, thanks. I'm not hungry.

320
00:39:04,406 --> 00:39:06,677
- You got to have...
- You show me.

321
00:39:06,764 --> 00:39:09,719
It's easy. Cut this first thing out
for a start.

322
00:39:09,801 --> 00:39:11,869
Get that, will you?

323
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:15,426
- Forget it, we'll go to lunch.
- Right, in a minute.

324
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:19,306
- Duty officer, please.
- 'Who wants him? '

325
00:39:19,392 --> 00:39:21,779
- Special Branch.
- Ah! Pat, it's Harry.

326
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:24,779
Hello! I think we might have
something for you.

327
00:39:24,868 --> 00:39:28,981
Shoreditch have picked up a bloke
we're holding a red card on.

328
00:39:29,065 --> 00:39:32,337
- Codename Housemartin.
- We'll be right down.

329
00:39:41,371 --> 00:39:43,884
- Palmer.
- Mr Palmer's just left, sir.

330
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:46,959
He said he'd be back soon.
Would you like to wait?

331
00:39:47,046 --> 00:39:49,354
Everything's under control, sir.

332
00:39:52,202 --> 00:39:54,031
I'm Palmer.

333
00:39:55,439 --> 00:39:57,395
Get the keys.

334
00:40:01,913 --> 00:40:03,868
This way, sir.

335
00:40:12,983 --> 00:40:15,018
Right, on your feet.

336
00:40:24,133 --> 00:40:25,927
He's dead, sir.

337
00:40:26,011 --> 00:40:28,602
Looks as if Bluejay beat us to it.

338
00:40:28,688 --> 00:40:31,326
I want to see his charge sheet.

339
00:40:41,197 --> 00:40:43,151
That's the one, sir.

340
00:40:44,793 --> 00:40:48,306
"Charged with unlawful possession
of a suitcase."

341
00:40:48,391 --> 00:40:52,778
- Where's the suitcase?
- The other gentleman took it.

342
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:56,377
- Did you see what was in it?
- Electrical equipment.

343
00:40:56,462 --> 00:40:59,532
"Arrested near Sandersons."
What's Sandersons?

344
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,574
It's a disused factory, sir.

345
00:41:01,658 --> 00:41:04,295
- Is that an outside phone?
- Yes, sir.

346
00:41:04,376 --> 00:41:07,844
- 225 Wellington Street.
- Calling Dalby?

347
00:41:07,934 --> 00:41:10,046
Up Dalby. I need a TX-82.

348
00:41:10,129 --> 00:41:12,197
You'll never get it, man.

349
00:41:12,287 --> 00:41:14,720
I did learn something working for Ross.

350
00:41:17,324 --> 00:41:19,279
- Keightley.
- 'Hello, Pat.

351
00:41:19,363 --> 00:41:21,715
- 'It's Harry Palmer.'
- What's up?

352
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:25,107
I want your help.
Housemartin's dead and I need a TX-82.

353
00:41:25,195 --> 00:41:28,582
You need a 3H security clearance.
What's your authority?

354
00:41:28,672 --> 00:41:30,866
Authority? CC1.

355
00:41:30,952 --> 00:41:32,905
CC1?

356
00:41:32,988 --> 00:41:35,376
All right, Harry, if you say so.

357
00:41:36,386 --> 00:41:38,341
Give me the time and place.

358
00:41:41,701 --> 00:41:43,450
2:30. They're late.

359
00:41:50,294 --> 00:41:52,249
- Palmer?
- I'm Palmer.

360
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:54,366
All right, let's get on with it.

361
00:42:00,682 --> 00:42:02,558
Come on, let's go.

362
00:42:14,391 --> 00:42:18,506
- The men are in position.
- Get them away from the door.

363
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:40,324
Having fun, Inspector?
Did you call this TX-82?

364
00:42:40,409 --> 00:42:45,160
- Yes, sir. I think Radcliffe's in there.
- Really? Get on with it, then.

365
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:53,990
Lose that door, will you?

366
00:43:13,656 --> 00:43:16,009
All right, split up.

367
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:18,651
Get some light in here, will you?

368
00:43:54,779 --> 00:43:58,654
- I wonder what sort of factory this was.
- Search me.

369
00:43:58,735 --> 00:44:00,689
No one here, sir.

370
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:03,960
- Get the men out of here.
- Right, sir.

371
00:44:04,051 --> 00:44:06,686
Get back in your cars. Come on, let's go.

372
00:44:08,367 --> 00:44:10,959
Come on, get moving.

373
00:44:11,044 --> 00:44:13,999
It looks as if all this
has been for nothing.

374
00:44:15,161 --> 00:44:17,114
That's not good enough.

375
00:44:17,198 --> 00:44:19,711
Come on, let's have you.

376
00:44:19,796 --> 00:44:23,910
This operation was timed to start at 2:25,
you started at 2:35,

377
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:26,139
that's not good enough.

378
00:44:27,669 --> 00:44:29,622
Good afternoon.

379
00:44:42,855 --> 00:44:44,809
Thank you.

380
00:44:44,892 --> 00:44:49,756
The next time you use CC1 authority,
just you make sure you have it.

381
00:44:53,884 --> 00:44:56,759
You know, it's funny.

382
00:44:56,842 --> 00:45:00,626
If Radcliffe had been here,
I'd have been...

383
00:45:00,718 --> 00:45:02,673
a hero.

384
00:45:02,757 --> 00:45:05,109
He wasn't and you're not.

385
00:45:58,106 --> 00:46:00,173
Major.

386
00:46:00,264 --> 00:46:02,217
This stove's still warm.

387
00:46:07,895 --> 00:46:09,850
I found this in it.

388
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,887
A piece of recording tape.

389
00:46:16,447 --> 00:46:18,641
- "Ipcress. "
- What?

390
00:46:18,727 --> 00:46:23,749
It's got "Ipcress" written on it.
See what Chilcott-Oakes can make of it.

391
00:46:23,841 --> 00:46:25,795
This might be something.

392
00:46:28,836 --> 00:46:30,904
Yes, Palmer, it might.

393
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:37,461
- By the way, have you had lunch?
- No.

394
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:39,300
No, sir.

395
00:46:39,386 --> 00:46:41,340
I'll buy you some.

396
00:47:03,885 --> 00:47:06,075
And what do you make of that?

397
00:47:07,201 --> 00:47:12,113
If I could have a bit more equipment,
I might be able to make something out.

398
00:47:12,197 --> 00:47:14,392
Well, keep it within reason.

399
00:47:14,476 --> 00:47:16,464
Well, it must mean something.

400
00:47:16,555 --> 00:47:19,065
Hardly worth a TX-82 though, was it?

401
00:47:19,152 --> 00:47:21,299
- Open a file on it.
- Right, sir.

402
00:47:23,146 --> 00:47:26,615
- Chico, why...
- And we still have to find Radcliffe.

403
00:47:26,704 --> 00:47:30,535
That means more legwork
and fewer hunches. Get on with it.

404
00:48:03,789 --> 00:48:06,142
Oh. Good morning, sir.

405
00:48:08,066 --> 00:48:10,020
"Champignons. "

406
00:48:10,782 --> 00:48:13,975
You're paying ten pence more
for a fancy French label.

407
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:17,686
If you want mushrooms,
you'd get better value on the next shelf.

408
00:48:17,775 --> 00:48:20,685
It's not just the label,
these do have a better flavour.

409
00:48:20,774 --> 00:48:24,445
Of course.
You're quite a gourmet, aren't you?

410
00:48:28,166 --> 00:48:30,234
Beefaroni? Extraordinary.

411
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:33,870
- I haven't seen you here before, sir.
- No, I don't...

412
00:48:33,962 --> 00:48:37,554
really care for
these American shopping methods.

413
00:48:37,639 --> 00:48:40,707
One has to move with the times,
I suppose. Hm?

414
00:48:40,795 --> 00:48:43,430
- Yes, that's very nice.
- Is it really?

415
00:48:43,512 --> 00:48:45,466
Mm.

416
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:49,944
- Settled down with Dalby, have you?
- Yes, sir.

417
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:54,216
- And the girl Courtney.
- You didn't come...

418
00:48:54,303 --> 00:48:56,257
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

419
00:48:56,341 --> 00:48:58,488
You didn't come to talk about...

420
00:48:58,579 --> 00:49:00,249
Oh, you men!

421
00:49:00,337 --> 00:49:03,849
...button mushrooms and birds.
- Perceptive of you.

422
00:49:05,573 --> 00:49:07,527
May I?

423
00:49:12,606 --> 00:49:18,358
That, erm, tape. You must have
a pretty thick file on it now.

424
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:21,073
That's right.

425
00:49:21,157 --> 00:49:23,669
That's baby food, sir.

426
00:49:27,111 --> 00:49:30,261
- I want to see it.
- Why don't you...

427
00:49:30,351 --> 00:49:32,303
Sorry.

428
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:37,412
Why don't you ask Dalby for it?

429
00:49:37,502 --> 00:49:40,890
- I don't want Dalby to know about it.
- Why not, sir?

430
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:44,013
Don't be impertinent, Palmer.

431
00:49:45,135 --> 00:49:48,283
- I want you to do a job for me.
- Have I any choice?

432
00:49:48,374 --> 00:49:50,043
Frankly, no.

433
00:49:50,131 --> 00:49:55,405
It's quite simple - I don't want the file,
I just want it microfilmed. Hm?

434
00:49:59,122 --> 00:50:00,270
Sir.

435
00:50:04,358 --> 00:50:08,235
- Stick that in my B-107.
- Very funny.

436
00:50:08,316 --> 00:50:11,509
- Excuse me, please.
- Yes, of course. So sorry.

437
00:50:16,106 --> 00:50:18,824
There are other people,
you know, Palmer.

438
00:50:18,906 --> 00:50:21,098
Why don't you try them?

439
00:50:21,182 --> 00:50:25,171
- Dalby's not to hear about this.
- You've already said that.

440
00:50:25,259 --> 00:50:27,770
Or your past might catch up with you.

441
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:31,641
You'll find yourself in a military prison.
Good morning.

442
00:50:41,044 --> 00:50:42,193
Thank you.

443
00:50:45,081 --> 00:50:48,434
Champignons?
Nothing but the best for our Palmer.

444
00:50:50,915 --> 00:50:53,222
You're working for Ross.

445
00:50:54,312 --> 00:50:56,619
He sent you here.

446
00:50:56,709 --> 00:51:00,983
Don't be silly. I'm working for Dalby.
You're working for Ross.

447
00:51:01,066 --> 00:51:04,100
I'm working for Dalby,
you're working for...

448
00:51:08,059 --> 00:51:10,048
Oh, what the hell?

449
00:51:10,136 --> 00:51:13,205
Courtney, I am gonna cook you...

450
00:51:13,295 --> 00:51:15,806
the best meal you've ever eaten.

451
00:51:22,847 --> 00:51:24,961
That was the most delicious meal.

452
00:51:45,306 --> 00:51:47,260
Good.

453
00:51:53,139 --> 00:51:55,855
Do you always wear your glasses?

454
00:51:55,937 --> 00:51:58,050
Yes.

455
00:51:58,132 --> 00:52:00,087
Except in bed.

456
00:52:47,368 --> 00:52:49,880
This is my itinerary for the weekend.

457
00:52:49,965 --> 00:52:54,114
I want you to know where I am
in case you become desperate to see me.

458
00:52:54,202 --> 00:52:57,350
- Considerate of you.
- If you spent it with me,

459
00:52:57,438 --> 00:53:00,667
we would save ourselves
both a lot of bother.

460
00:53:17,421 --> 00:53:19,374
Yours, I take it?

461
00:53:20,818 --> 00:53:24,568
I'm sorry to spoil your weekend
but we're working tomorrow.

462
00:53:24,653 --> 00:53:26,689
Saturday?

463
00:53:29,608 --> 00:53:32,882
- Grantby's discontinued number?
- Turn it over.

464
00:53:35,483 --> 00:53:40,030
- "The band of the Irish Guards. "
- And very good they are, too.

465
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:43,428
I think you'll find it most interesting.

466
00:53:43,516 --> 00:53:47,300
I'll see you at the bandstand at...
three o'clock.

467
00:54:05,457 --> 00:54:07,411
What's this called?

468
00:54:08,213 --> 00:54:10,168
The Thin Red Line.

469
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:16,520
Good, patriotic stuff.
Got a proper rhythm to it.

470
00:54:19,044 --> 00:54:20,998
Not quite your line, eh?

471
00:54:21,082 --> 00:54:23,548
I prefer Bach or Mozart.

472
00:54:25,718 --> 00:54:28,310
You're lucky, Mozart next.

473
00:54:29,635 --> 00:54:31,350
Oh, really?

474
00:55:05,321 --> 00:55:09,310
We are interested in a certain piece
of scientific equipment.

475
00:55:09,396 --> 00:55:12,033
The proto-proton scattering device?

476
00:55:12,115 --> 00:55:13,867
Quite so.

477
00:55:13,953 --> 00:55:17,544
We understand that...
you hold the sole rights.

478
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:20,699
I wouldn't say that
I hold them personally.

479
00:55:23,665 --> 00:55:25,302
A fine piece that.

480
00:55:25,382 --> 00:55:27,814
Thank you. The band of the Irish Guards

481
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:31,605
would now like to play you
a light and classical overture,

482
00:55:31,696 --> 00:55:34,333
this by Mozart - The Marriage Of Figaro.

483
00:55:37,891 --> 00:55:41,516
There's a delicacy and precision
about Mozart's work.

484
00:55:41,608 --> 00:55:45,960
Transcribes remarkably well
from the orchestra to the military band.

485
00:55:46,043 --> 00:55:48,874
- Don't you agree?
- Oh, yes. Of course.

486
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:53,032
I might be able to arrange
those rights for you.

487
00:55:53,117 --> 00:55:55,787
My principals are prepared to buy.

488
00:55:55,874 --> 00:55:57,942
Shall we say 15,000?

489
00:55:58,033 --> 00:56:03,420
My dear sir, this is not a clearance sale.
I can get a much better price than that.

490
00:56:03,507 --> 00:56:05,462
20, then?

491
00:56:06,344 --> 00:56:08,298
25.

492
00:56:08,383 --> 00:56:10,337
- Agreed.
- Cash.

493
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:14,971
Here are the delivery arrangements.

494
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:24,995
Very neat.

495
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:29,078
Must we sit through any more
of this torture? I have things to do.

496
00:56:29,165 --> 00:56:32,870
- I think they're playing very well.
- Tell me who wins.

497
00:59:44,864 --> 00:59:46,818
Look out!

498
01:00:55,399 --> 01:00:57,591
Congratulations, Palmer,

499
01:00:57,676 --> 01:01:00,233
you've just killed an American agent.

500
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:18,125
The CIA should have let us know
they had a tail on Grantby.

501
01:01:18,177 --> 01:01:22,326
Anyway, that'll teach them
not to poach on our preserve.

502
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:25,880
Tell me, Dalby, how is Radcliffe?

503
01:01:26,969 --> 01:01:29,242
He doesn't remember being lifted.

504
01:01:29,327 --> 01:01:33,714
Physically, he seems all right.
Just needs a few weeks rest.

505
01:01:33,803 --> 01:01:36,599
- Keep the S1 surveillance on him.
- Mm-hm.

506
01:01:36,681 --> 01:01:39,432
I'll put Palmer on him.

507
01:01:41,036 --> 01:01:43,149
Do you think that's wise?

508
01:01:46,151 --> 01:01:48,947
You know your own business best,
I suppose.

509
01:01:49,709 --> 01:01:52,664
Ah. Very good tea.

510
01:01:54,225 --> 01:01:56,180
Good morning.

511
01:02:13,647 --> 01:02:15,601
Thank you.

512
01:02:18,282 --> 01:02:20,953
Well, did you find it interesting?

513
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:22,516
Oh, yes.

514
01:02:27,675 --> 01:02:30,471
Have you seen
the collection of portrait miniatures?

515
01:02:30,551 --> 01:02:33,300
- No.
- No! Then we must go there tomorrow.

516
01:02:33,387 --> 01:02:34,660
Yeah.

517
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:44,373
Sorry to keep you waiting, Palmer.

518
01:02:51,572 --> 01:02:53,843
Bit of a rush but I think we'll make it.

519
01:03:02,561 --> 01:03:05,072
- Out of breath, doctor?
- I'm all right.

520
01:03:05,158 --> 01:03:07,113
In you go.

521
01:03:11,314 --> 01:03:14,860
My dear fellow,
I'm delighted to see you looking so well.

522
01:03:14,949 --> 01:03:17,462
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Not at all.

523
01:03:17,547 --> 01:03:19,502
- Shall we begin?
- Certainly.

524
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:23,370
I'll just say a few words
and then I'll leave it to you.

525
01:03:24,501 --> 01:03:28,456
Ladies and gentlemen,
you've probably all heard something

526
01:03:28,537 --> 01:03:30,730
on our scientific bush telegraph

527
01:03:30,816 --> 01:03:35,249
about Dr Radcliffe's
proto-proton scattering experiments.

528
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:41,594
It is largely due to Dr Radcliffe that
control of the fusion of hydrogen atoms,

529
01:03:41,686 --> 01:03:45,641
and all that means in terms
of the world's energy resources,

530
01:03:45,722 --> 01:03:48,360
is getting appreciably nearer every day.

531
01:03:48,439 --> 01:03:53,554
So it is with great pleasure that I ask
Dr Radcliffe to give this symposium

532
01:03:53,635 --> 01:03:57,101
his account
of the results of his latest work.

533
01:03:58,230 --> 01:04:00,185
Thank you, Sir Robert.

534
01:04:02,465 --> 01:04:05,694
Ladies and gentlemen...

535
01:04:05,784 --> 01:04:10,569
today I shall be dealing with
a new meson production method...

536
01:04:12,056 --> 01:04:14,444
which stems from the result...

537
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:19,520
...a new...

538
01:04:19,611 --> 01:04:22,681
meson production...

539
01:04:24,805 --> 01:04:26,396
A new...

540
01:04:27,683 --> 01:04:31,752
meson production... method...

541
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:33,907
Dr Radcliffe, are you all right?

542
01:04:49,463 --> 01:04:51,416
Hold it right there.

543
01:04:53,339 --> 01:04:55,294
Over against the wall.

544
01:04:57,697 --> 01:04:59,650
Right, now, don't move a muscle.

545
01:04:59,734 --> 01:05:03,359
- I thought you British were subtle.
- Very subtle, like you.

546
01:05:03,449 --> 01:05:06,040
- Trigger-happy, too.
- What are you doing here?

547
01:05:06,129 --> 01:05:08,083
- I'm tailing you.
- Why?

548
01:05:08,166 --> 01:05:10,598
Because you killed one of our men.

549
01:05:11,724 --> 01:05:13,677
Uh-uh.

550
01:05:16,678 --> 01:05:18,633
Open it.

551
01:05:24,271 --> 01:05:27,102
- Why did you kill him?
- He came straight at me.

552
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:30,258
Yeah... that's what Dalby said.

553
01:05:32,663 --> 01:05:35,300
- What do you know about Grantby?
- Nothing.

554
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:39,211
Now get this, I'm gonna tail you
till I know you're clean.

555
01:05:39,297 --> 01:05:42,172
And if you're not clean...

556
01:05:44,054 --> 01:05:46,327
I'm gonna kill you.

557
01:06:18,502 --> 01:06:20,456
Ah, there you are, Dalby.

558
01:06:22,897 --> 01:06:26,011
We'll lunch at my club -
we can walk there.

559
01:06:26,093 --> 01:06:28,811
Good bit of lunch at your club, is it?

560
01:06:28,891 --> 01:06:31,881
Not bad. The Dover sole's rather good.

561
01:06:35,286 --> 01:06:38,591
Have you seen
the medical report on Radcliffe?

562
01:06:38,681 --> 01:06:40,955
No.

563
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:45,509
The psychiatrist says he's suffering
from some form of amnesia.

564
01:06:45,597 --> 01:06:47,951
Physically, he's perfectly normal

565
01:06:48,034 --> 01:06:51,307
but he can no longer function
as a physicist.

566
01:06:51,392 --> 01:06:55,222
Apparently, that part of his life
is a complete blank.

567
01:06:55,307 --> 01:06:59,058
Scientist suddenly
becoming non-productive, eh?

568
01:06:59,143 --> 01:07:02,053
Seems to fit in with
your brain-drain idea.

569
01:07:02,141 --> 01:07:05,812
- Yes, exactly.
- What's our next move, then?

570
01:07:06,977 --> 01:07:09,408
Grantby.

571
01:07:09,494 --> 01:07:14,360
What sticks in my craw
is that he sold us damaged goods.

572
01:07:14,450 --> 01:07:17,484
I've sent Palmer
to try and get the money back.

573
01:07:17,567 --> 01:07:21,239
You don't think a man like Grantby
will do the right thing?

574
01:07:21,323 --> 01:07:23,993
What shall I do? Pull him in, then?

575
01:07:24,082 --> 01:07:26,036
No, I wouldn't advise that.

576
01:07:28,316 --> 01:07:31,068
- Let's play him a little.
- It's dangerous.

577
01:07:31,154 --> 01:07:35,507
- He could easily give us the slip.
- Oh, we'll take that risk.

578
01:07:35,591 --> 01:07:37,545
If you say so.

579
01:07:40,586 --> 01:07:42,858
- Incidentally...
- Hm?

580
01:07:42,943 --> 01:07:46,411
...the Americans
have put a tail on Palmer.

581
01:07:46,501 --> 01:07:48,455
How very tiresome of them.

582
01:07:49,177 --> 01:07:52,291
If he's clean,
he's got nothing to worry about.

583
01:07:52,376 --> 01:07:55,843
And if he isn't,
the Americans will take care of him -

584
01:07:55,933 --> 01:07:57,885
save us a lot of bother.

585
01:08:06,163 --> 01:08:08,436
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

586
01:08:08,522 --> 01:08:11,634
- Major Dalby sent me to see you.
- Indeed.

587
01:08:11,716 --> 01:08:14,023
- Too tired to come himself?
- No.

588
01:08:14,114 --> 01:08:17,946
It seems that you've been
slightly dishonest, Mr Grantby.

589
01:08:18,030 --> 01:08:22,100
- The goods you sold us were damaged.
- I merely agreed to deliver him.

590
01:08:22,188 --> 01:08:24,461
His condition is no concern of mine.

591
01:08:24,545 --> 01:08:28,376
Nevertheless, we would like
our money back.

592
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:31,493
No. I am merely a pipeline.

593
01:08:31,577 --> 01:08:35,363
You haven't been long
in this business but you'll learn.

594
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:55,234
Harry.

595
01:08:55,317 --> 01:08:57,431
- What?
- Come here a minute.

596
01:09:07,465 --> 01:09:08,816
What?

597
01:09:08,904 --> 01:09:11,575
Round here,
I want to show you something.

598
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:18,130
"Induction of psychoneuroses

599
01:09:18,215 --> 01:09:21,682
"by conditioned reflex under stress."

600
01:09:23,131 --> 01:09:25,084
What does that mean?

601
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:29,046
It means I know why
17 scientists ceased to function.

602
01:09:29,127 --> 01:09:31,274
- Yes?
- Look again, boy.

603
01:09:31,364 --> 01:09:37,587
I-P-C-R-E-S-S.

604
01:09:37,677 --> 01:09:39,666
Ipcress.

605
01:09:41,632 --> 01:09:44,350
- Have you got your car outside?
- Yes.

606
01:09:44,432 --> 01:09:48,626
I'm going to see Radcliffe.
I want to try a wee experiment.

607
01:09:48,708 --> 01:09:52,582
Take a look at it while I'm away.
Be sure to lock it up after you.

608
01:09:52,663 --> 01:09:54,617
Right.

609
01:10:39,579 --> 01:10:42,570
Hello, Pat. This is Harry. What is it?

610
01:10:52,888 --> 01:10:54,842
Yes.

611
01:10:56,926 --> 01:10:58,880
Thank you.

612
01:11:47,239 --> 01:11:49,830
Jock's dead.

613
01:11:49,915 --> 01:11:52,825
He... He was shot in my car.

614
01:11:52,913 --> 01:11:56,267
That American agent
must have thought it was me.

615
01:11:56,350 --> 01:12:00,182
- You'd better move into my place.
- Yes.

616
01:12:01,463 --> 01:12:04,101
I'll go and get my things.

617
01:12:23,245 --> 01:12:25,200
Come on, I'll drop you off.

618
01:13:38,177 --> 01:13:41,482
Palmer here, Major,
I must talk to you at once.

619
01:13:41,572 --> 01:13:43,324
Very.

620
01:13:43,411 --> 01:13:46,366
N... No, I can't talk on the telephone.

621
01:13:46,448 --> 01:13:48,482
I must see you.

622
01:13:48,566 --> 01:13:51,839
Yes. Yes, I know T108.

623
01:14:11,784 --> 01:14:15,410
I hope this won't take too long.
I have an appointment for dinner.

624
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:19,206
All right. There's a dead
American agent in my flat.

625
01:14:20,217 --> 01:14:24,048
- You killed him?
- Someone is trying to frame me.

626
01:14:24,134 --> 01:14:26,850
Now, who would want to do
a thing like that?

627
01:14:26,931 --> 01:14:31,125
Jock Carswell got somewhere with
the Ipcress file and he showed it to me.

628
01:14:31,208 --> 01:14:33,356
I am being framed by whoever killed him.

629
01:14:33,445 --> 01:14:37,752
- Can you prove any of this?
- The file was stolen from my desk.

630
01:14:37,842 --> 01:14:39,957
By Grantby, of course.

631
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:41,677
No.

632
01:14:41,759 --> 01:14:43,792
- Ross.
- Ross?

633
01:14:45,353 --> 01:14:48,070
He once asked me
to microfilm the Ipcress file.

634
01:14:48,152 --> 01:14:52,937
- Why didn't you tell me before?
- He'd have put me back in jail.

635
01:14:53,987 --> 01:14:56,295
What time does
your cleaning woman arrive?

636
01:14:56,385 --> 01:14:59,530
- About nine.
- Gives you exactly 12 hours.

637
01:14:59,618 --> 01:15:03,929
Leave me to sort this out.
You, lose yourself.

638
01:15:05,256 --> 01:15:08,403
Someone is trying to frame me,
you've got to help me.

639
01:15:08,492 --> 01:15:10,925
But you're just too hot, Palmer.

640
01:15:21,801 --> 01:15:23,472
Harry.

641
01:15:23,559 --> 01:15:27,264
- They might be watching for you.
- I'll be watching for them.

642
01:15:28,594 --> 01:15:31,025
I'll miss that train.

643
01:15:53,092 --> 01:15:55,047
See you.

644
01:16:23,903 --> 01:16:25,654
Colonel Ross, please.

645
01:16:27,779 --> 01:16:30,212
'... leave platform 14

646
01:16:30,376 --> 01:16:35,446
'will connect with
the transcontinental express for...

647
01:16:35,532 --> 01:16:40,362
'... travelling via Prague,
Budapest and Belgrade.'

648
01:16:43,046 --> 01:16:45,604
Thank you.

649
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:11,249
I'd like a word with you, sir.

650
01:17:19,652 --> 01:17:23,722
Palmer's found a dead
American agent in his flat.

651
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:28,832
- Did he do it?
- He says not. Claims he's being framed.

652
01:17:30,802 --> 01:17:34,677
- Where is he now?
- I don't know.

653
01:17:34,758 --> 01:17:39,351
He also told me that you'd expressed
an interest in the Ipcress file.

654
01:17:39,434 --> 01:17:43,388
Your department has developed
a remarkably high casualty rate.

655
01:17:43,469 --> 01:17:46,743
- I wonder why.
- You better pick up Grantby.

656
01:17:46,827 --> 01:17:48,896
I suggested that earlier.

657
01:17:48,985 --> 01:17:51,019
Do it now, will you?

658
01:18:01,013 --> 01:18:02,968
Billets.

659
01:18:03,051 --> 01:18:05,243
Billets.

660
01:18:11,966 --> 01:18:14,157
- Yes?
- Tickets, please.

661
01:19:28,332 --> 01:19:30,288
Hey!

662
01:20:22,043 --> 01:20:24,112
Wait a minute.

663
01:21:50,402 --> 01:21:54,835
- Who are you?
- I'm a doctor. Lie still, please.

664
01:21:54,917 --> 01:21:58,351
What's wrong with these zombies?
Can't they speak?

665
01:21:58,436 --> 01:22:01,629
You don't speak English in Albania.

666
01:22:04,030 --> 01:22:07,018
- Albania?
- The land of my fathers.

667
01:22:15,020 --> 01:22:18,611
This... starving and freezing...

668
01:22:18,696 --> 01:22:21,129
won't work with me, Grantby.

669
01:22:21,214 --> 01:22:23,248
- No?
- No.

670
01:22:23,333 --> 01:22:25,161
I can resist it.

671
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:28,320
- I read the file.
- I know.

672
01:22:28,409 --> 01:22:31,079
That's why you're here.

673
01:22:37,039 --> 01:22:41,028
We'll give him two more days
then we'll start the treatment.

674
01:22:57,101 --> 01:22:59,454
All right, zombie. All right.

675
01:23:11,288 --> 01:23:13,242
How are you feeling?

676
01:23:13,327 --> 01:23:16,839
- You're the doctor, you tell me.
- Do sit down.

677
01:23:47,695 --> 01:23:49,648
He's ready.

678
01:25:05,623 --> 01:25:10,214
The Gestapo and the MVD used to beat a
man for months to get him to this state.

679
01:25:10,298 --> 01:25:12,333
But it's old-fashioned and crude.

680
01:25:12,418 --> 01:25:14,407
And so slow.

681
01:25:17,333 --> 01:25:19,561
Relax.

682
01:25:21,008 --> 01:25:22,962
Relax.

683
01:25:23,045 --> 01:25:26,719
You are getting sleepy. Relax.

684
01:25:26,803 --> 01:25:28,872
Quite relaxed.

685
01:25:28,962 --> 01:25:31,314
'Listen to my voice. '

686
01:25:32,559 --> 01:25:35,991
Nothing but my voice.

687
01:25:38,672 --> 01:25:41,389
You will forget the Ipcress noise.

688
01:25:43,908 --> 01:25:47,295
You will forget all about the Ipcress file.

689
01:25:49,581 --> 01:25:52,538
'You will forget your name. '

690
01:25:55,178 --> 01:25:58,770
Harry Palmer. My name is Harry Palmer.

691
01:25:58,854 --> 01:26:01,366
You have no name.

692
01:26:02,451 --> 01:26:05,804
Harry Palmer. My name is Harry Palmer.

693
01:26:05,887 --> 01:26:07,921
No name.

694
01:26:09,004 --> 01:26:12,879
'My name is Harry Palmer. Harry Palmer. '

695
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:16,035
My name is Harry Palmer.

696
01:26:16,118 --> 01:26:18,312
He's using pain to distract himself.

697
01:26:23,990 --> 01:26:25,944
Get him down.

698
01:26:34,861 --> 01:26:37,089
Put padding on the straps next time.

699
01:26:37,180 --> 01:26:41,213
- You want to make it easy for me?
- No. For me.

700
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:53,764
- He is difficult.
- He'll respond.

701
01:26:53,843 --> 01:26:55,796
Intensify the treatment.

702
01:26:55,881 --> 01:26:59,665
Every time he falls asleep,
wake him up and bring him here.

703
01:28:32,312 --> 01:28:34,302
Ready.

704
01:28:40,625 --> 01:28:44,137
Fit the rhythm of
the sound and vision to his brainwaves,

705
01:28:44,223 --> 01:28:46,576
it'll make for a much deeper response.

706
01:28:47,978 --> 01:28:51,888
Relax.

707
01:28:53,652 --> 01:28:56,005
'Quite relaxed.

708
01:28:58,848 --> 01:29:01,359
'Listen to my voice.

709
01:29:02,365 --> 01:29:04,672
'Nothing but my voice.

710
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:10,072
'Relax. Relax'.

711
01:29:11,635 --> 01:29:13,590
Quite relaxed.

712
01:29:15,073 --> 01:29:17,461
You are getting sleepy.

713
01:29:18,470 --> 01:29:20,583
Your eyelids are getting heavy.

714
01:29:22,267 --> 01:29:24,221
Heavy as lead.

715
01:29:26,903 --> 01:29:28,857
'Heavy as lead.

716
01:29:29,699 --> 01:29:33,086
'You will try but
you can't open your eyes.

717
01:29:35,056 --> 01:29:38,727
'You have forgotten the Ipcress noise.

718
01:29:38,810 --> 01:29:41,719
'You have forgotten the Ipcress file. '

719
01:29:41,807 --> 01:29:44,638
You have forgotten your name.

720
01:29:47,324 --> 01:29:49,961
'What is your name? '

721
01:29:53,277 --> 01:29:58,395
Now you will hear a voice say,
"Now listen to me. "

722
01:29:58,473 --> 01:30:01,825
'You will always obey this voice. '

723
01:30:05,387 --> 01:30:08,456
'Now, listen to me. Listen to me.

724
01:30:10,103 --> 01:30:12,774
'You are here because you are a traitor.

725
01:30:13,739 --> 01:30:15,692
'Listen to me.

726
01:30:16,617 --> 01:30:19,253
'You are here because you are a traitor.

727
01:30:20,334 --> 01:30:23,880
'A traitor who killed
the agents of your allies.

728
01:30:25,526 --> 01:30:28,835
'A traitor who stole the Ipcress file.

729
01:30:28,925 --> 01:30:33,551
'A traitor who sold the Ipcress file
to an enemy of your country.

730
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:38,392
'Now, listen to me. Listen to me. '

731
01:30:40,354 --> 01:30:42,308
Now repeat after me,

732
01:30:43,590 --> 01:30:50,139
"Whenever I hear the voice say,
'Now, listen to me,' I will obey. "

733
01:30:51,185 --> 01:30:56,972
"When I hear the voice say,
'Now, listen to me,' I will obey. "

734
01:30:58,736 --> 01:31:01,852
You will wake up when I count five.

735
01:31:04,134 --> 01:31:08,089
You will forget what's happened to you
but you will remember your name.

736
01:31:08,170 --> 01:31:11,842
One, two, three,

737
01:31:11,927 --> 01:31:13,881
four...

738
01:31:15,002 --> 01:31:16,321
five.

739
01:31:22,435 --> 01:31:24,583
He's responding very well.

740
01:32:21,301 --> 01:32:23,255
Aah!

741
01:34:07,444 --> 01:34:10,637
Operator. CC1 exchange.

742
01:34:15,156 --> 01:34:17,748
- Hello.
- This is Palmer.

743
01:34:19,232 --> 01:34:21,300
Where are you?

744
01:34:22,990 --> 01:34:25,946
In a call box at Austin's Wharf Lane.

745
01:34:26,028 --> 01:34:27,982
Just a minute.

746
01:34:28,866 --> 01:34:30,818
He's broken out.

747
01:34:31,822 --> 01:34:36,289
- Is he programmed?
- I'd have preferred more treatments.

748
01:34:36,377 --> 01:34:39,013
Try him.

749
01:34:39,096 --> 01:34:41,244
Now, listen to me. Listen to me.

750
01:34:42,532 --> 01:34:44,759
Are you listening?

751
01:34:45,768 --> 01:34:48,599
- Yes.
- Phone Colonel Ross

752
01:34:48,687 --> 01:34:51,357
and ask him to meet you
at the warehouse

753
01:34:51,443 --> 01:34:54,909
then go back there yourself
and I will meet you there.

754
01:34:56,200 --> 01:34:58,836
'Now, listen to me. Listen to me. '

755
01:35:00,077 --> 01:35:04,905
Do it now, then hang up
and forget what I have just said.

756
01:35:13,384 --> 01:35:16,816
Get those men
out of the warehouse immediately.

757
01:35:54,706 --> 01:35:56,660
Palmer?

758
01:36:03,337 --> 01:36:05,724
Palmer?

759
01:36:11,650 --> 01:36:15,479
Stop, Major.
Don't say a word or I'll kill you.

760
01:36:21,081 --> 01:36:23,113
Shut the door.

761
01:36:25,396 --> 01:36:27,350
Don't say a word, not a word.

762
01:36:48,335 --> 01:36:50,290
Right, over here.

763
01:36:53,652 --> 01:36:55,880
There.

764
01:36:55,969 --> 01:36:58,435
Get back to the wall, under the light.

765
01:37:40,048 --> 01:37:42,355
Put it down.

766
01:37:44,283 --> 01:37:46,876
- What the hell are you doing?
- Shut up.

767
01:37:53,036 --> 01:37:55,026
Didn't tell me Dalby'd be here.

768
01:39:15,721 --> 01:39:18,185
What has happened to you, Palmer?

769
01:39:19,397 --> 01:39:22,591
One of you knows exactly
what has happened to me.

770
01:39:22,675 --> 01:39:25,583
One of you is a double agent.

771
01:39:25,670 --> 01:39:27,786
You're right, Palmer.

772
01:39:27,869 --> 01:39:31,061
Who wanted you
to microfilm the Ipcress file?

773
01:39:33,103 --> 01:39:34,979
I did that to test you.

774
01:39:36,180 --> 01:39:38,408
Ross killed Carswell.

775
01:39:38,499 --> 01:39:40,453
Don't be bloody ridiculous.

776
01:39:42,696 --> 01:39:46,652
Ross couldn't have known that
Carswell had cracked the Ipcress file.

777
01:39:46,733 --> 01:39:48,561
Courtney told him.

778
01:39:51,967 --> 01:39:53,999
Jean was working for you?

779
01:39:54,084 --> 01:39:57,960
Yes. I'd suspected this one
for some time.

780
01:39:59,919 --> 01:40:01,670
It won't work, Ross.

781
01:40:03,156 --> 01:40:07,589
You used Courtney
just as you've tried to use Palmer.

782
01:40:07,672 --> 01:40:09,626
Ross killed the CIA man.

783
01:40:10,749 --> 01:40:12,703
He framed you.

784
01:40:14,427 --> 01:40:16,733
- You bastard.
- Oh dear!

785
01:40:17,823 --> 01:40:20,175
You used to call me
a passed-over major.

786
01:40:24,737 --> 01:40:29,045
Now, listen to me. Listen to me.

787
01:40:30,090 --> 01:40:32,045
Shoot Ross.

788
01:40:40,283 --> 01:40:44,351
Shoot the traitor... now.

789
01:41:25,959 --> 01:41:30,188
I was counting on you being
an insubordinate bastard, Palmer.

790
01:41:31,754 --> 01:41:33,707
You used me as a decoy.

791
01:41:35,710 --> 01:41:39,098
I might have been killed
or driven stark, raving mad.

792
01:41:39,188 --> 01:41:41,142
That's what you're paid for.

793
01:41:55,812 --> 01:41:57,767
Thank you.
