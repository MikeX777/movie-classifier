2
00:01:46,482 --> 00:01:47,538
Oi.

3
00:01:49,138 --> 00:01:50,578
Excuse me.

4
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,843
I'm wondering when the next
Ipswich train's arriving?

5
00:01:53,874 --> 00:01:55,282
The train's delayed,

6
00:01:55,314 --> 00:01:58,386
Central will be calling us
shortly and we'll let you know.

7
00:02:09,745 --> 00:02:13,329
Unfortunately, these
things take some time.

8
00:02:13,362 --> 00:02:15,409
I'll be announcing the
arrival time for you soon,

9
00:02:15,442 --> 00:02:17,747
it shouldn't be too long.

10
00:02:17,778 --> 00:02:18,579
Oh okay.

11
00:02:20,787 --> 00:02:21,651
That way?

12
00:02:21,682 --> 00:02:22,674
Yeah.

13
00:02:22,707 --> 00:02:23,507
Okay.

14
00:03:08,947 --> 00:03:11,219
And Jesus
said to them,

15
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,594
with men it is not possible,

16
00:03:12,627 --> 00:03:15,026
but with God it is possible.

17
00:03:15,059 --> 00:03:18,418
Because with God, all
things are possible.

18
00:03:25,011 --> 00:03:26,067
What's her name?

19
00:03:26,098 --> 00:03:27,570
Daisy.

20
00:03:27,602 --> 00:03:28,530
Daisy!

21
00:03:29,362 --> 00:03:31,122
That's a nice name for a cow.

22
00:03:33,651 --> 00:03:35,922
My dad had cows when
I was a little boy.

23
00:03:37,331 --> 00:03:39,122
And this, this is a Friesian.

24
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:43,538
You use girl cows
like this for milking.

25
00:03:44,786 --> 00:03:45,682
Not for meat.

26
00:03:48,114 --> 00:03:50,642
But you can, still
eat Friesians.

27
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,706
Go on boy, get on with it.

28
00:04:16,051 --> 00:04:18,162
Can't hold a bloody
calf. Useless.

29
00:04:26,898 --> 00:04:28,722
Some things only
good for eating.

30
00:04:39,826 --> 00:04:41,811
The train to
Ipswich has been delayed.

31
00:04:41,842 --> 00:04:43,923
We're sorry for
the inconvenience,

32
00:04:43,954 --> 00:04:46,419
the train will be
arriving in forty minutes.

33
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:47,889
Wouldn't want to lose Daisy.

34
00:05:14,865 --> 00:05:16,498
Be not be conformed
to this world,

35
00:05:17,843 --> 00:05:20,946
but be transformed by the
renewing of your mind.

36
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:12,658
I will not cause pain, without
something new being born.

37
00:07:12,691 --> 00:07:13,843
His blood.

38
00:07:13,874 --> 00:07:14,930
He entered the.

39
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,051
I don't need a
ride, thanks though.

40
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,034
Yeah not bad, it's been
pretty quiet tonight.

41
00:10:03,314 --> 00:10:05,074
Yeah, how was your
day yesterday?

42
00:10:07,538 --> 00:10:08,306
Yeah.

43
00:10:09,683 --> 00:10:10,994
That's great, there's
a little old man

44
00:10:11,026 --> 00:10:13,970
that's been waiting
so I'll let him know.

45
00:10:14,002 --> 00:10:15,314
Thanks, bye!

46
00:10:57,234 --> 00:10:59,219
Oh my God, oh my God!

47
00:10:59,251 --> 00:11:00,275
Sir?

48
00:11:00,307 --> 00:11:01,106
Sir?

49
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,051
It's Claire Duncan
from Borree Station

50
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,650
I need urgent medical
assistance, over!

51
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:05,778
Hi, good evening.

52
00:12:23,763 --> 00:12:25,619
If you need anything,
just buzz me.

53
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:27,922
Okay, thanks.

54
00:13:12,723 --> 00:13:16,946
Excuse me, you just, you
forgot this in the room.

55
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,938
The girl from Mr. Moore's room.

56
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,826
No, no, I'm in room 11.

57
00:13:23,858 --> 00:13:25,394
Mr. Moore's not my patient.

58
00:13:25,425 --> 00:13:26,706
It's Mr. Dallas.

59
00:13:28,562 --> 00:13:30,290
Yeah, I know that.

60
00:13:30,322 --> 00:13:32,114
But that Mr. Moore's room.

61
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,386
That how we call it here.

62
00:13:42,323 --> 00:13:44,050
What's your name, dear?

63
00:13:44,082 --> 00:13:45,841
Rose, my name is Rose.

64
00:13:47,858 --> 00:13:49,043
Okay Rose.

65
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,250
Why don't you go
back to your room

66
00:13:51,282 --> 00:13:52,722
and take care of your patient?

67
00:13:54,098 --> 00:13:56,274
I have a call from
room number three.

68
00:13:59,985 --> 00:14:01,651
These girls were assaulted

69
00:14:01,683 --> 00:14:03,539
and now they're
under observation.

70
00:14:07,154 --> 00:14:11,409
So, if you need
anything, just buzz me.

71
00:14:12,498 --> 00:14:13,298
Okay?

72
00:14:30,866 --> 00:14:32,274
Are you
calling me a snob?

73
00:14:32,307 --> 00:14:33,489
Yeah, I guess I am.

74
00:14:33,522 --> 00:14:35,922
Well, I can't help it
if you have dumb taste.

75
00:14:35,955 --> 00:14:38,385
Jo, back me up here.

76
00:14:38,418 --> 00:14:39,762
Sorry, I wasn't listening.

77
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,490
I'm saying that we should
go see Trivium today

78
00:14:41,521 --> 00:14:42,771
instead of Cattle Decapitation

79
00:14:42,803 --> 00:14:44,787
since we just saw
them in the spring.

80
00:14:44,819 --> 00:14:46,194
No.

81
00:14:46,226 --> 00:14:47,507
That's it?

82
00:14:47,538 --> 00:14:48,467
You're a snob, too.

83
00:14:48,498 --> 00:14:50,387
No, here's the thing.

84
00:14:50,418 --> 00:14:52,658
Whether or not you like their
music doesn't really matter.

85
00:14:52,689 --> 00:14:53,970
Do you really wanna deal
with than many teenagers?

86
00:14:54,001 --> 00:14:54,994
You're right.

87
00:14:55,026 --> 00:14:56,339
And so am I.

88
00:14:56,371 --> 00:14:57,395
No, you're still a snob.

89
00:14:57,427 --> 00:14:58,930
Whatever, dummy.

90
00:15:09,202 --> 00:15:11,731
Dammit, I forgot,
the landlord's here.

91
00:15:11,763 --> 00:15:14,065
Do we have
to talk to him?

92
00:15:14,098 --> 00:15:15,250
There they are.

93
00:15:15,283 --> 00:15:16,403
They made it.

94
00:15:16,434 --> 00:15:18,291
Hey, I'm Dean.

95
00:15:18,323 --> 00:15:19,090
Dean.

96
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:24,147
Sorry, did you girls
find the place okay?

97
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:25,681
Uh yeah, it was fine.

98
00:15:25,714 --> 00:15:28,498
We had GPS and it crapped
out, but we found it.

99
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,683
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

100
00:15:29,715 --> 00:15:31,474
Signal can be a little
bit patchy out here.

101
00:15:31,506 --> 00:15:32,274
Sorry about that.

102
00:15:32,305 --> 00:15:33,330
So do you live here?

103
00:15:33,361 --> 00:15:34,225
Yeah.

104
00:15:34,258 --> 00:15:36,402
Yeah, welcome to Chez Dean.

105
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,834
Don't worry, I stay in the
RV when I rent the place out,

106
00:15:38,865 --> 00:15:42,323
so, we can just play
the landlord game.

107
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,818
You can pretend like
I'm your mean landlord

108
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,194
and I'm always in your hair.

109
00:15:47,891 --> 00:15:48,818
I'm just kidding.

110
00:15:48,851 --> 00:15:51,954
I'm really, I'm really nice.

111
00:15:51,987 --> 00:15:52,979
Come on.

112
00:15:53,011 --> 00:15:54,963
At least smile a little bit, or.

113
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,281
So serious.

114
00:16:03,025 --> 00:16:03,825
All right.

115
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,547
Here we are.

116
00:16:06,578 --> 00:16:08,371
So, you girls get settled and
then come on out to the porch.

117
00:16:08,403 --> 00:16:10,899
I got some beers and sodas
for ya if you're thirsty.

118
00:16:12,243 --> 00:16:13,554
Thanks, but we'll probably

119
00:16:13,585 --> 00:16:15,666
be heading to the festival soon.

120
00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:16,498
That's fine.

121
00:16:18,258 --> 00:16:19,122
Here are the keys.

122
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:22,643
Don't lose 'em.

123
00:16:25,362 --> 00:16:26,802
Geez.

124
00:16:26,834 --> 00:16:29,459
Sorry we don't wanna hang out
with some rando on our vacay.

125
00:16:29,491 --> 00:16:30,258
Creep.

126
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:33,203
Right, and, no Wi-Fi.

127
00:16:33,234 --> 00:16:34,962
Don't worry, I
printed the lineup.

128
00:16:36,754 --> 00:16:37,681
We'll be fine.

129
00:16:41,202 --> 00:16:42,322
See?

130
00:16:42,354 --> 00:16:43,698
If we start with
Cattle Decapitation,

131
00:16:43,731 --> 00:16:46,162
we'll be at the Murder Stage,
already for Benediction.

132
00:16:46,194 --> 00:16:47,475
Fine.

133
00:17:03,699 --> 00:17:04,947
I guess that's fine.

134
00:17:06,803 --> 00:17:08,209
I found this in the freezer.

135
00:17:08,242 --> 00:17:09,555
Holy fuck!

136
00:17:09,587 --> 00:17:10,355
Is that real?

137
00:17:10,387 --> 00:17:11,154
Looks real.

138
00:17:11,185 --> 00:17:12,049
Jesus!

139
00:17:12,082 --> 00:17:13,331
We should call the cops.

140
00:17:14,322 --> 00:17:16,722
Yeah, but should we though?

141
00:17:16,754 --> 00:17:19,026
Yeah, this guy's probably
a fucking serial killer.

142
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:20,178
Here's the thing.

143
00:17:20,211 --> 00:17:22,258
If we do call, I mean,
even if we could,

144
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,978
since none of our
phones work out here,

145
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:27,891
we'd have to deal with
that whole hassle,

146
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:31,185
and miss out on the
entire festival.

147
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:35,122
He could be a med student,
and that's a cadaver thing.

148
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,498
We don't know!

149
00:17:36,531 --> 00:17:39,025
And I mean, there's three of us.

150
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,594
He's not very big.

151
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:42,865
I guess we could pretend
we didn't see it,

152
00:17:42,898 --> 00:17:45,458
and call the cops at the
end, before we leave.

153
00:17:47,762 --> 00:17:48,529
Yeah, okay.

154
00:18:04,658 --> 00:18:05,778
You're gonna
owe us 50 bucks.

155
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:10,514
You guys, be
quiet, or he'll hear us.

156
00:18:12,243 --> 00:18:14,322
Look, I still don't buy it.

157
00:18:14,354 --> 00:18:16,147
You guys are so full of shit.

158
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,034
Shh, or he's gonna come
in here and murder us.

159
00:18:24,275 --> 00:18:25,458
Holy shit.

160
00:18:25,491 --> 00:18:26,578
Let me hold it.

161
00:18:28,914 --> 00:18:30,547
I bet it's not even real.

162
00:18:30,578 --> 00:18:32,434
That fucker's real.

163
00:18:32,467 --> 00:18:35,187
We weren't shitting you.

164
00:18:37,234 --> 00:18:38,771
Do you think we should go?

165
00:18:38,802 --> 00:18:43,602
Probably, but
tomorrow's line up is so good.

166
00:18:46,451 --> 00:18:48,913
Well, I guess they aren't
gonna make us breakfast.

167
00:18:48,945 --> 00:18:52,082
I can't believe I made out
with a guy in a Slipknot shirt.

168
00:18:53,713 --> 00:18:55,378
At least you
didn't break a girl's nose.

169
00:18:55,411 --> 00:18:56,562
I feel so bad.

170
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,482
Don't, it wasn't your fault.

171
00:18:58,513 --> 00:19:01,011
Plus, we got to meet
Castrator in the med tent.

172
00:19:01,042 --> 00:19:02,034
True.

173
00:19:02,067 --> 00:19:03,505
Okay, good night.

174
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:04,530
No, no!

175
00:19:04,562 --> 00:19:05,842
It's noon.

176
00:19:05,874 --> 00:19:09,682
I'm so excited to not
see Trivium again.

177
00:19:09,714 --> 00:19:10,611
You are a snob.

178
00:19:10,642 --> 00:19:12,114
Oh.

179
00:19:12,146 --> 00:19:12,945
Hey girls.

180
00:19:14,418 --> 00:19:16,307
Just planting some new shrubs.

181
00:19:16,338 --> 00:19:18,451
Of course you're probably
not into gardening.

182
00:19:18,483 --> 00:19:22,642
You're into more dark stuff
like burning bushes, right?

183
00:19:22,674 --> 00:19:25,489
I mean, not like in the
Bible burning bushes.

184
00:19:25,522 --> 00:19:26,385
Nah man.

185
00:19:26,418 --> 00:19:29,907
Gardening's cool, you do you.

186
00:19:29,938 --> 00:19:30,707
Okay.

187
00:19:30,738 --> 00:19:31,891
We're gonna get going.

188
00:19:31,923 --> 00:19:33,714
Sure, don't
let me keep you.

189
00:19:33,747 --> 00:19:34,547
We won't.

190
00:19:35,698 --> 00:19:37,042
Okay, have a good one.

191
00:19:37,074 --> 00:19:37,873
You, too.

192
00:19:52,338 --> 00:19:53,842
Oh boy, here we go.

193
00:19:53,874 --> 00:19:55,027
Don't bring up Nate out back.

194
00:19:55,058 --> 00:19:56,306
Maybe we don't need
to include him.

195
00:19:56,339 --> 00:19:57,266
Yeah.

196
00:19:57,299 --> 00:19:58,546
Hey girls.

197
00:19:58,578 --> 00:20:00,435
Uh, this is my buddy Carl.

198
00:20:01,362 --> 00:20:02,737
How was today, did you have fun?

199
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:04,371
Um, yeah.

200
00:20:04,402 --> 00:20:05,939
Why don't you join us
for a couple of drinks

201
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,537
and tell us the highlights?

202
00:20:07,569 --> 00:20:09,267
Oh thanks, but
we're really tired

203
00:20:09,298 --> 00:20:12,051
from headbanging and all,
so we're just gonna turn in.

204
00:20:12,082 --> 00:20:13,555
Aww, man.

205
00:20:13,586 --> 00:20:15,378
What's wrong with
girls these days?

206
00:20:16,691 --> 00:20:18,963
I feel like we're
being good hosts.

207
00:20:18,994 --> 00:20:21,330
We're getting nothing
but the cold shoulder.

208
00:20:21,362 --> 00:20:22,707
No smiles, nothing?

209
00:20:22,738 --> 00:20:23,889
We don't feel like it.

210
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:25,554
Oh, you will.

211
00:20:32,082 --> 00:20:33,106
Night, night.

212
00:20:36,147 --> 00:20:37,267
I can't stay here.

213
00:20:37,297 --> 00:20:38,898
Now there's another creepy guy,

214
00:20:38,931 --> 00:20:41,971
and I think we're putting
ourselves in a bad situation.

215
00:20:42,003 --> 00:20:44,145
You didn't just say we were
asking for it, did you?

216
00:20:44,178 --> 00:20:45,747
No, that's not what I mean.

217
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:46,962
But it'd be really
fucking stupid,

218
00:20:46,993 --> 00:20:49,491
especially after what
we found in the freezer.

219
00:20:49,522 --> 00:20:50,291
No.

220
00:20:50,322 --> 00:20:51,825
No, what?

221
00:20:51,858 --> 00:20:52,979
We're not leaving.

222
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,195
We're not surrendering.

223
00:20:54,226 --> 00:20:56,082
They don't get to
dictate what we do.

224
00:20:56,115 --> 00:20:56,882
Right.

225
00:20:56,915 --> 00:20:58,002
Fuck those guys.

226
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:02,385
I'll go keep an
eye on 'em, go on.

227
00:21:03,282 --> 00:21:04,659
Hey Ash?

228
00:21:38,162 --> 00:21:39,378
We were wrong.

229
00:21:39,411 --> 00:21:40,979
Pack, now.

230
00:21:46,995 --> 00:21:47,955
What the fuck?

231
00:21:47,986 --> 00:21:49,171
Was that always there?

232
00:21:49,202 --> 00:21:51,249
Who puts a reverse
lock on the door?

233
00:21:51,282 --> 00:21:52,499
Murderers.

234
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:53,778
Break the window.

235
00:21:53,811 --> 00:21:54,579
Hey girls.

236
00:21:55,442 --> 00:21:56,466
Did you find my gifts?

237
00:21:57,555 --> 00:21:59,602
It's what metal girls
are into, right?

238
00:21:59,634 --> 00:22:02,930
Well, I have so much
more I wanna show you.

239
00:22:02,963 --> 00:22:05,906
But first, it's dinner time.

240
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,483
Alright. No need for
grace here, girls, dig in.

241
00:22:14,514 --> 00:22:16,499
I'm a vegetarian.

242
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:17,426
Me, too.

243
00:22:17,459 --> 00:22:18,834
Yes, that.

244
00:22:18,867 --> 00:22:20,370
Oh.

245
00:22:20,402 --> 00:22:22,066
Now, now, girls.

246
00:22:22,098 --> 00:22:24,083
That sounds like bullshit to me.

247
00:22:25,651 --> 00:22:30,451
My good friend Dean here spent
three hours smoking that.

248
00:22:35,506 --> 00:22:37,074
So, stop being such
little bitches,

249
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:41,746
and show some
appreciation to your chef.

250
00:22:43,731 --> 00:22:45,170
I said enjoy it!

251
00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:47,315
Can I get a knife?

252
00:22:47,346 --> 00:22:49,043
You do not need a knife, no.

253
00:22:49,074 --> 00:22:49,874
It's very tender.

254
00:22:56,915 --> 00:22:57,779
You're gonna need a new shirt.

255
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:58,643
No, it's fine.

256
00:22:58,674 --> 00:23:00,082
It was on the plate.

257
00:23:00,114 --> 00:23:00,882
Come with me.

258
00:23:00,915 --> 00:23:01,682
No, it's fine.

259
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:03,091
It's clean.

260
00:23:03,122 --> 00:23:04,209
No, I promise I'll eat
everything, it's so good.

261
00:23:04,243 --> 00:23:05,394
I said shut up!

262
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:09,490
Don't even think about it.

263
00:23:09,522 --> 00:23:10,322
Nate.

264
00:23:12,594 --> 00:23:14,259
Shit, what'd you do?

265
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:16,402
Shut up and help me
get her to the fucking studio.

266
00:23:16,434 --> 00:23:17,939
Oh my god!

267
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:21,810
Excuse me.

268
00:23:22,802 --> 00:23:24,114
May I use the restroom?

269
00:23:24,146 --> 00:23:24,946
Ask me again.

270
00:23:27,058 --> 00:23:28,659
May I use the restroom, please?

271
00:23:30,258 --> 00:23:31,794
Since you asked so nicely.

272
00:23:33,714 --> 00:23:36,050
But don't take too long.

273
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:37,651
I don't wanna miss that face.

274
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:40,690
I don't think that's
something I can control.

275
00:23:41,554 --> 00:23:42,354
Go, go.

276
00:24:03,794 --> 00:24:04,658
Where is Ashley?

277
00:24:06,482 --> 00:24:08,723
Ash was tired so I put her in
the studio where it's quiet.

278
00:24:08,754 --> 00:24:10,226
I need to see her and
make sure she's okay.

279
00:24:10,258 --> 00:24:12,307
No, no, no, no, no.

280
00:24:12,338 --> 00:24:14,642
You sit right here and
finish your dinner, okay?

281
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,298
Carl.

282
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,323
Where's the other one?

283
00:24:18,354 --> 00:24:19,442
Bathroom.

284
00:24:19,474 --> 00:24:21,586
Well go keep a
fucking eye on her.

285
00:24:30,066 --> 00:24:31,507
Yes?

286
00:24:31,538 --> 00:24:33,010
You know, it's really creepy

287
00:24:33,042 --> 00:24:34,866
to have someone watch you eat.

288
00:24:34,899 --> 00:24:36,307
Is that what you were going for?

289
00:24:36,338 --> 00:24:38,483
Stop talking! I will tell
you when I want you to talk.

290
00:24:38,514 --> 00:24:41,107
Do you do this to
all your guests?

291
00:24:41,138 --> 00:24:44,722
Hold them captive and force
feed them your shit barbecue?

292
00:24:45,778 --> 00:24:47,218
Be honest.

293
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:50,355
Are you fattening us up to
make skin coats out of us?

294
00:24:50,386 --> 00:24:51,986
Do you dance around
naked in front

295
00:24:52,018 --> 00:24:54,834
of your mirror checking
out your mangina?

296
00:24:54,866 --> 00:24:56,594
Like if I go down to
your basement right now,

297
00:24:56,626 --> 00:24:58,162
am I gonna find a
shit ton of moths,

298
00:24:58,194 --> 00:24:59,698
you useless piece of shit.

299
00:25:05,234 --> 00:25:07,666
Carl, I need your help.

300
00:25:07,698 --> 00:25:08,626
I got it.

301
00:25:08,658 --> 00:25:10,034
You get the door.

302
00:25:13,202 --> 00:25:14,034
Fuck!

303
00:25:22,258 --> 00:25:23,122
Okay.

304
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:37,330
Hey.

305
00:25:37,362 --> 00:25:39,122
It's time to come
back to dinner now.

306
00:25:43,986 --> 00:25:44,754
Fuck.

307
00:25:47,442 --> 00:25:48,243
Nate.

308
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:50,930
The, yes.

309
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:52,978
Jesus Christ.

310
00:25:55,698 --> 00:25:57,459
Did that last one try to come
out the window or anything?

311
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,674
No.

312
00:25:58,706 --> 00:25:59,827
I didn't hear any glass
break out front neither.

313
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:01,458
Alright, great, I'm
just gonna keep looking.

314
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:02,643
Well I can help.

315
00:26:02,675 --> 00:26:04,498
Stay here in case she
tries to break out.

316
00:26:04,531 --> 00:26:05,874
Carl's securing the other one.

317
00:26:31,858 --> 00:26:33,682
Oh, what the fuck?

318
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:43,442
Nate!

319
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:46,226
Shit, what is it?

320
00:26:46,258 --> 00:26:47,218
It's a pen.

321
00:26:50,546 --> 00:26:51,571
Get it out!

322
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:55,858
Fuck, it's locked.

323
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,490
Hold on,
I'll check the back.

324
00:26:57,522 --> 00:26:59,890
Get us out of
here, it's a trap!

325
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:06,035
We don't have much time.

326
00:27:06,067 --> 00:27:07,955
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

327
00:27:07,987 --> 00:27:08,786
Fuck that.

328
00:27:08,819 --> 00:27:10,098
They're dead.

329
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,090
Wait!

330
00:27:11,122 --> 00:27:12,914
I want the knife.

331
00:27:17,106 --> 00:27:19,570
I'm gonna kill those bitches.

332
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:27,314
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

333
00:27:27,346 --> 00:27:29,682
Oh fuck, Nate!

334
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:32,178
You wanna fuckin' die, bitch?

335
00:27:33,747 --> 00:27:34,546
Ah, fuck!

336
00:27:38,034 --> 00:27:40,402
No, you bitches!

337
00:27:40,434 --> 00:27:41,394
Carl.

338
00:28:06,834 --> 00:28:09,202
You are not entitled to
the attention of women.

339
00:29:31,282 --> 00:29:32,145
What's going on?

340
00:29:32,178 --> 00:29:32,947
Who are you?

341
00:29:32,978 --> 00:29:33,875
Where's the lady,

342
00:29:33,907 --> 00:29:35,442
the one who was just
here just a minute ago?

343
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:36,370
Okay, calm down.

344
00:29:36,402 --> 00:29:37,298
Who are you talking about?

345
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:38,675
I'm talking about the nurse.

346
00:29:38,707 --> 00:29:40,499
The one who was here
just a few minutes ago.

347
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:41,650
I saw her.

348
00:29:41,682 --> 00:29:43,122
Which room are you?

349
00:29:43,154 --> 00:29:47,794
I'm in room 11 and something
happened next to my patient,

350
00:29:48,658 --> 00:29:50,003
something appeared and
was bleeding, bleeding.

351
00:29:50,034 --> 00:29:50,899
Okay, just breathe,
just breathe.

352
00:29:50,931 --> 00:29:52,210
And bleeding, and bleeding.

353
00:29:52,242 --> 00:29:53,265
Just breath, just breath.

354
00:29:53,298 --> 00:29:54,578
It's okay.

355
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:56,274
Come here, take a seat.

356
00:29:59,827 --> 00:30:00,914
I'll make you some tea.

357
00:30:03,282 --> 00:30:05,874
I'm Steve, I just
started my shift.

358
00:30:08,818 --> 00:30:11,378
You must have fallen
asleep and had a nightmare.

359
00:30:14,867 --> 00:30:16,561
People tends to freak out
in this place at night.

360
00:30:16,594 --> 00:30:19,185
No, it wasn't a
nightmare, it was real.

361
00:30:20,242 --> 00:30:21,138
I won't deny,

362
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:25,715
some pretty bizarre things
happen in this place.

363
00:30:28,403 --> 00:30:33,171
In fact, a patient with an
eating disorder went insane.

364
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:35,219
The police brought her here.

365
00:30:35,251 --> 00:30:38,322
She told them a story,
they couldn't prove.

366
00:33:07,122 --> 00:33:08,305
Piggy!

367
00:33:08,338 --> 00:33:09,138
What's up?

368
00:33:11,731 --> 00:33:12,914
Hey, hey!

369
00:33:12,945 --> 00:33:14,161
Who's that guy?

370
00:33:14,195 --> 00:33:15,121
It's her boyfriend.

371
00:33:15,155 --> 00:33:16,050
Her boyfriend?

372
00:33:16,081 --> 00:33:17,331
- Yes.
- Come on.

373
00:33:17,363 --> 00:33:19,665
You've got a boyfriend
and I didn't know?

374
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:22,194
I can't believe you've
pulled and not told us.

375
00:33:22,227 --> 00:33:24,211
Come on Piggy, come on.

376
00:33:26,449 --> 00:33:31,249
Your boyfriend's gorgeous, eh.

377
00:33:32,627 --> 00:33:35,698
That bikini looks
great on you, love it.

378
00:33:38,738 --> 00:33:39,858
Are you laughing at me?

379
00:33:41,842 --> 00:33:42,930
Piggy!

380
00:33:42,962 --> 00:33:44,467
I'm talking to you!

381
00:33:51,314 --> 00:33:52,787
Where you going pigster?

382
00:33:52,818 --> 00:33:53,619
Hey, your boyfriend's leaving!

383
00:33:54,963 --> 00:33:59,282
Don't let him get
away, you look great together!

384
00:34:07,283 --> 00:34:09,203
Call him back!

385
00:34:12,882 --> 00:34:14,227
Let's go, come on.

386
00:34:15,123 --> 00:34:15,922
Come on.

387
00:34:39,154 --> 00:34:41,329
Time to clean the
bugs out of the pool.

388
00:34:42,354 --> 00:34:45,362
Maca, you're too much.

389
00:34:45,395 --> 00:34:46,259
Hey, didn't you know pigs

390
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:47,571
aren't allowed in the pool?

391
00:34:50,387 --> 00:34:52,627
C'mon, Maca,
leave it, leave it.

392
00:34:52,658 --> 00:34:55,411
Boyfriend's not around
to help you now, is he pig?

393
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:59,251
Maca, let it go.

394
00:34:59,283 --> 00:35:00,178
Oh, I'm sorry!

395
00:35:00,211 --> 00:35:01,011
Hold on!

396
00:35:01,842 --> 00:35:03,091
Careful you don't drown.

397
00:35:04,051 --> 00:35:05,747
I helping you, don't drown.

398
00:35:06,707 --> 00:35:08,242
Grab the pole, come on grab it.

399
00:35:09,778 --> 00:35:11,922
Claudia, give me hand,
she weighs a ton.

400
00:35:13,905 --> 00:35:15,603
Claudia!

401
00:35:15,634 --> 00:35:16,753
Piggy!

402
00:35:16,785 --> 00:35:18,834
Look this way, you look amazing.

403
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:19,633
Smile!

404
00:35:26,034 --> 00:35:26,835
Smile!

405
00:35:28,499 --> 00:35:30,898
You're going to be famous now!

406
00:35:48,851 --> 00:35:50,067
Claudia, come on,
come on, come on!

407
00:35:50,098 --> 00:35:50,867
Come on.

408
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:22,962
Well, well, well!

409
00:37:24,882 --> 00:37:26,162
Where you going?

410
00:37:27,249 --> 00:37:28,051
What's up?

411
00:37:30,771 --> 00:37:32,466
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

412
00:37:49,329 --> 00:37:50,227
Give me that.

413
00:37:50,257 --> 00:37:52,659
Give me that, give me that.

414
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:53,490
Hey.

415
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:56,787
Hey, lardass!

416
00:37:58,355 --> 00:37:59,794
Too heavy.

417
00:37:59,827 --> 00:38:00,754
Lardass!

418
00:41:15,794 --> 00:41:17,555
Help me Sara!

419
00:41:17,587 --> 00:41:18,386
Help!

420
00:41:20,914 --> 00:41:21,874
Please Sara!

421
00:41:23,762 --> 00:41:24,626
Sara, Sara!

422
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:30,450
Sara, help me, Sara!

423
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:38,450
Please help me Sara!

424
00:41:40,114 --> 00:41:41,235
Sara, help me!

425
00:41:44,979 --> 00:41:45,778
Please!

426
00:41:51,314 --> 00:41:52,083
Sara.

427
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:24,179
The nurse mentioned
this Mr. Moore guy,

428
00:43:24,211 --> 00:43:28,083
when I told her I was taking
care of a patient in room 11.

429
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:34,418
But when I asked her who
he was she didn't answer.

430
00:43:36,402 --> 00:43:38,322
Who was this Mr. Moore guy?

431
00:43:52,306 --> 00:43:54,322
Mr. Moore was a patient

432
00:43:54,354 --> 00:43:56,210
that was admitted
here many years ago.

433
00:43:57,811 --> 00:44:00,498
80 percent of his body was
badly burned in a fire.

434
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:04,146
I wasn't working here at
the time but they told me

435
00:44:04,178 --> 00:44:06,642
Mr. Moore kept screaming
and moaning in pain.

436
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:10,323
Medication didn't help.

437
00:44:10,355 --> 00:44:12,018
Nobody wanted to
take care of him,

438
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:15,602
not because he was
disfigured from the burns.

439
00:44:17,426 --> 00:44:21,554
Every time somebody was near
him, he would try to grab them,

440
00:44:21,586 --> 00:44:24,338
begging them for help for
the excruciating pain.

441
00:44:29,714 --> 00:44:33,650
In the end, they had to
restrain him to the bed.

442
00:44:33,682 --> 00:44:37,267
One night, the buzzer
went off in his room.

443
00:44:40,019 --> 00:44:41,874
When the nurse went
to answer the call,

444
00:44:42,995 --> 00:44:45,683
and went to saw his
bed, it was empty.

445
00:44:48,306 --> 00:44:49,619
They never saw him again.

446
00:44:51,026 --> 00:44:52,627
That's Mr. Moore's story.

447
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:57,010
But like I said,
sometimes things

448
00:44:57,042 --> 00:44:58,227
are just our imagination.

449
00:45:38,962 --> 00:45:40,114
Carrie?

450
00:45:40,146 --> 00:45:41,459
Sam, what
are you doing...

451
00:45:41,491 --> 00:45:43,314
It happened.

452
00:45:43,347 --> 00:45:44,114
Really?

453
00:45:44,146 --> 00:45:44,914
Yeah.

454
00:45:44,946 --> 00:45:45,906
Are you sure this time?

455
00:45:46,866 --> 00:45:47,986
Pretty sure.

456
00:45:48,019 --> 00:45:48,946
Yes!

457
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:50,258
You should be excited!

458
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:51,859
It finally happened.

459
00:45:51,891 --> 00:45:54,067
Look, I'm gonna get
you some tampons, okay?

460
00:45:56,178 --> 00:45:57,875
Wait, there's no pads?

461
00:46:27,474 --> 00:46:29,555
What are y'all
doin' in here? Good Lord!

462
00:46:29,587 --> 00:46:31,954
Sam got her period, but
I got it under control.

463
00:46:31,986 --> 00:46:33,970
Welcome to the
club, little girl!

464
00:46:34,002 --> 00:46:36,051
Shut up, Jessica,
you're like three months older.

465
00:46:36,083 --> 00:46:38,003
Yeah, well, I got
my period like two years ago.

466
00:46:38,034 --> 00:46:38,835
Really?

467
00:46:38,867 --> 00:46:39,827
I'm just trying to help.

468
00:46:39,858 --> 00:46:41,202
It's not like she's got a mom

469
00:46:41,234 --> 00:46:42,322
to tell her about these things.

470
00:46:42,354 --> 00:46:44,338
Well, your daddy
problems are showing.

471
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:46,002
Your daddy problems are showing.

472
00:46:47,699 --> 00:46:48,531
Oh!

473
00:46:48,563 --> 00:46:49,842
Y'all, Trevor and
Jake just got here.

474
00:46:49,874 --> 00:46:50,707
So let's go, come on!

475
00:46:50,738 --> 00:46:52,146
Wait, Sam, are you okay?

476
00:46:52,178 --> 00:46:53,394
Sam, literally,
just stick it in there.

477
00:46:53,427 --> 00:46:54,258
You'll be fine!

478
00:46:54,291 --> 00:46:55,730
Come on, let's go!

479
00:47:13,523 --> 00:47:14,323
Shit.

480
00:47:55,954 --> 00:47:57,938
Sam, did
you plug it in okay?

481
00:47:58,739 --> 00:47:59,922
Stop!

482
00:47:59,954 --> 00:48:03,474
Girl, you know
I'm just playing around.

483
00:48:03,507 --> 00:48:04,627
I didn't even, like,

484
00:48:04,658 --> 00:48:06,099
know how to skate when
I was this little.

485
00:48:06,131 --> 00:48:07,538
I wish there
was college guys here.

486
00:48:31,155 --> 00:48:33,458
Sam, you know you can't make out

487
00:48:33,489 --> 00:48:35,378
with Jake like you
planned, right?

488
00:48:35,409 --> 00:48:36,658
I didn't plan that.

489
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:37,907
And why can't she?

490
00:48:37,938 --> 00:48:40,178
You can't just make out
on your period, Carrie,

491
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:41,554
because, one, it's gross,

492
00:48:41,587 --> 00:48:44,178
and then two, what if
he tries to go further?

493
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:45,778
Who told you that?

494
00:48:45,811 --> 00:48:46,898
Everybody knows that.

495
00:48:51,889 --> 00:48:52,722
Hey, you know what?

496
00:48:52,754 --> 00:48:53,491
Let's go skating.

497
00:48:54,609 --> 00:48:56,082
I think it'll make
you feel better.

498
00:48:56,115 --> 00:48:57,138
I don't know.

499
00:48:57,171 --> 00:48:58,227
I promise.

500
00:49:40,689 --> 00:49:43,059
All right,
ladies and gentlemen.

501
00:49:43,091 --> 00:49:45,585
It's DJ Rocket's
favorite time of night

502
00:49:45,618 --> 00:49:46,802
and I know it's yours.

503
00:49:46,835 --> 00:49:48,819
It's couples skate,
Take her by the hand,

504
00:49:48,851 --> 00:49:51,378
treat her nice, or I
will come find you.

505
00:49:51,409 --> 00:49:52,498
Enjoy.

506
00:50:30,162 --> 00:50:31,602
I'm getting my money back.

507
00:50:31,633 --> 00:50:32,498
Yeah.

508
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:33,811
It's the Boogeywoman doin' it.

509
00:50:33,842 --> 00:50:35,251
Oh, shut up, Trevor!

510
00:50:35,283 --> 00:50:36,755
It's an electrical problem.

511
00:50:36,786 --> 00:50:38,002
What's the Boogeywoman?

512
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:39,666
Every time the power
goes out in Bradley,

513
00:50:39,699 --> 00:50:42,129
it's because the Boogeywoman
took another man's soul.

514
00:50:42,162 --> 00:50:43,539
My mom says
the Boogeywoman's

515
00:50:43,571 --> 00:50:45,747
just a made-up
thing about sexism.

516
00:50:45,778 --> 00:50:46,803
She can eat me.

517
00:50:46,834 --> 00:50:47,602
My mom?

518
00:50:48,339 --> 00:50:49,427
The Boogeywoman.

519
00:50:49,458 --> 00:50:50,865
You're disgusting.

520
00:50:52,658 --> 00:50:54,227
One slice.

521
00:50:54,258 --> 00:50:55,026
You sure?

522
00:50:55,059 --> 00:50:56,434
One slice?

523
00:50:56,467 --> 00:51:00,051
- Yeah, just, just the one.
- Okay, you hungry?

524
00:51:04,305 --> 00:51:05,971
I'll have two slices, please?

525
00:51:06,003 --> 00:51:07,122
One's for her.

526
00:51:07,153 --> 00:51:07,954
Gotcha.

527
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:12,882
Oh, my stars, okay,
there's been an accident.

528
00:51:12,913 --> 00:51:16,722
Uh, Betty, Betty, this
young lady needs help.

529
00:51:16,753 --> 00:51:17,554
Hey!

530
00:51:18,866 --> 00:51:20,307
What's going on?

531
00:51:23,859 --> 00:51:24,659
What's wrong with you?

532
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:25,682
Oh my God.

533
00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:26,482
All that blood.

534
00:51:26,514 --> 00:51:27,282
I hate blood!

535
00:51:27,313 --> 00:51:28,178
Oh my God.

536
00:51:28,209 --> 00:51:29,555
You're full of blood.

537
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:30,450
Yeah, but it's
inside my body, Carrie, God.

538
00:51:30,482 --> 00:51:32,049
Whatever.

539
00:51:45,458 --> 00:51:46,609
She must have just run

540
00:51:46,642 --> 00:51:48,562
into someone when
the lights went out.

541
00:51:48,595 --> 00:51:50,449
Oh my God, is it
still happening?

542
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:52,114
She's not the only one bleeding.

543
00:51:52,978 --> 00:51:53,715
What?

544
00:51:53,746 --> 00:51:54,898
Don't you dare.

545
00:51:54,931 --> 00:51:56,722
Y'all, Sam just got
her first period.

546
00:51:57,682 --> 00:51:59,089
Wait, right now?

547
00:52:00,978 --> 00:52:02,066
Jake.

548
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:02,962
Sam.

549
00:52:02,995 --> 00:52:03,858
Jake's afraid of blood!

550
00:52:03,889 --> 00:52:05,010
I can't believe you!

551
00:52:05,042 --> 00:52:07,186
What, she should be proud!

552
00:52:07,218 --> 00:52:08,722
Now you're fair prey
for the Boogeywoman.

553
00:52:08,755 --> 00:52:10,482
She waits for girls to get it.

554
00:52:10,513 --> 00:52:12,018
Starts wiping out
her competition.

555
00:52:12,051 --> 00:52:13,555
You're sick.

556
00:52:13,586 --> 00:52:15,602
Sam, let's get you outta here.

557
00:52:16,595 --> 00:52:17,555
Come on, let's go.

558
00:52:20,883 --> 00:52:21,682
God!

559
00:52:29,778 --> 00:52:30,705
Bitch!

560
00:52:33,427 --> 00:52:35,730
Carrie told me about your mom.

561
00:52:35,762 --> 00:52:37,842
About how she died
because of you.

562
00:52:37,875 --> 00:52:38,675
Stop!

563
00:52:57,331 --> 00:52:58,417
Right, that's
what we wanted to see,

564
00:52:58,449 --> 00:52:59,795
the lights are back, people!

565
00:52:59,826 --> 00:53:02,067
We are back in action, okay!

566
00:53:04,818 --> 00:53:07,539
Trevor, we gotta get outta here.

567
00:53:09,042 --> 00:53:09,842
Trev.

568
00:53:10,802 --> 00:53:11,602
Trev!

569
00:53:33,234 --> 00:53:34,482
You look like her.

570
00:53:39,411 --> 00:53:40,306
Like who?

571
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:41,970
Steve?

572
01:06:15,409 --> 01:06:18,067
Bonjour to you to, madame.

573
01:06:18,098 --> 01:06:19,923
Sorry, who are you?

574
01:06:21,105 --> 01:06:23,538
Human popsicle
looking for a lift.

575
01:06:23,571 --> 01:06:24,339
Well.

576
01:06:26,355 --> 01:06:27,155
That's bad.

577
01:06:28,627 --> 01:06:29,938
Oh yeah?

578
01:06:29,971 --> 01:06:31,762
Now that you mentioned it.

579
01:06:31,794 --> 01:06:33,042
I haven't seen anyone all day.

580
01:06:33,075 --> 01:06:33,875
Yeah.

581
01:06:34,995 --> 01:06:36,625
No one lives here.

582
01:06:36,658 --> 01:06:38,289
Good thing I ran into you, then.

583
01:06:41,971 --> 01:06:44,082
What are you doing
here, anyways?

584
01:06:45,330 --> 01:06:46,547
It's complicated.

585
01:06:47,411 --> 01:06:48,754
But I can tell you about it.

586
01:06:56,754 --> 01:06:59,762
Well I'm going that direction.

587
01:06:59,795 --> 01:07:01,171
So.

588
01:07:01,203 --> 01:07:03,027
Any way's fine with me.

589
01:07:03,058 --> 01:07:05,394
- Okay.
- My name is Oz.

590
01:07:05,425 --> 01:07:06,225
Sylvie.

591
01:07:12,435 --> 01:07:14,195
Okay, get in then.

592
01:07:14,226 --> 01:07:14,994
Yeah?

593
01:07:15,026 --> 01:07:15,793
Yeah.

594
01:07:15,825 --> 01:07:16,594
Thanks!

595
01:07:16,627 --> 01:07:17,745
Yeah.

596
01:07:17,778 --> 01:07:19,474
Put your bag in the
back and yeah, let's go.

597
01:07:31,314 --> 01:07:32,113
All right.

598
01:07:35,058 --> 01:07:35,953
Who's this guy?

599
01:07:35,985 --> 01:07:37,235
Don't touch it.

600
01:07:37,266 --> 01:07:38,099
Sorry.

601
01:07:38,130 --> 01:07:38,898
Thank you.

602
01:07:45,202 --> 01:07:47,314
So, complicated?

603
01:07:48,722 --> 01:07:49,875
What?

604
01:07:49,906 --> 01:07:51,475
A bit
earlier you just said.

605
01:07:58,355 --> 01:08:00,882
Been walking for 108 days now.

606
01:08:03,186 --> 01:08:05,010
Needed to clear my head.

607
01:08:06,418 --> 01:08:08,882
That's a pretty long
time to clear your head.

608
01:08:08,915 --> 01:08:10,291
Got a big head.

609
01:08:17,746 --> 01:08:19,571
First time driving?

610
01:08:21,299 --> 01:08:22,098
No.

611
01:08:23,282 --> 01:08:25,522
The car is a bit ruddy
and old, that's it.

612
01:08:29,394 --> 01:08:31,443
Forget to get in
there or something?

613
01:08:31,474 --> 01:08:33,553
Gotta keep track time somehow.

614
01:08:34,706 --> 01:08:35,730
Okay.

615
01:08:35,762 --> 01:08:36,563
And you?

616
01:08:37,425 --> 01:08:42,225
What's your story?

617
01:10:45,618 --> 01:10:47,634
There's got to be a
better way to do it.

618
01:10:50,162 --> 01:10:52,179
I don't know what else to do.

619
01:11:51,602 --> 01:11:54,162
You can, you can stay at
my place if you want to.

620
01:11:54,194 --> 01:11:57,330
It's, you know, it's
cold, it's getting late.

621
01:11:59,954 --> 01:12:00,754
Yeah.

622
01:12:02,707 --> 01:12:03,506
Thanks.

623
01:12:49,202 --> 01:12:50,290
Don't touch anything.

624
01:12:51,442 --> 01:12:52,466
I learned my lesson.

625
01:13:22,226 --> 01:13:24,242
How do you do the eyes?

626
01:13:25,875 --> 01:13:28,786
You don't start with the eyes.

627
01:13:28,818 --> 01:13:32,082
First you have to
remove the skin.

628
01:13:34,354 --> 01:13:35,922
You treat it, preserve it.

629
01:13:38,546 --> 01:13:42,386
And then when that's done
you pin it on the model

630
01:13:44,946 --> 01:13:49,267
and you sew it back up
and when that's done,

631
01:13:50,706 --> 01:13:51,762
then you put the eyes.

632
01:13:54,323 --> 01:13:55,474
But never the real ones.

633
01:13:59,922 --> 01:14:01,683
I'll put on some tea.

634
01:14:01,715 --> 01:14:02,866
Can I help?

635
01:14:02,898 --> 01:14:04,146
No, no,
no, no, it's okay.

636
01:14:09,202 --> 01:14:10,706
Are you going to do the deer?

637
01:14:11,666 --> 01:14:12,466
Yeah.

638
01:14:14,514 --> 01:14:15,506
Yeah, he deserves it.

639
01:14:25,874 --> 01:14:26,675
I've.

640
01:14:28,946 --> 01:14:31,026
I've never killed
anything before.

641
01:14:31,059 --> 01:14:33,138
Hey, that wasn't your fault.

642
01:14:34,387 --> 01:14:37,394
I mean, it happens all the time.

643
01:14:37,426 --> 01:14:38,227
Right?

644
01:14:49,554 --> 01:14:52,434
Yeah, you know that's
what I love about it.

645
01:14:56,371 --> 01:14:58,546
I mean, it's kind of like
giving them a fresh start.

646
01:15:03,442 --> 01:15:07,891
No matter what horrible
things happen to them,

647
01:15:07,923 --> 01:15:12,050
they have a chance to be okay.

648
01:15:20,114 --> 01:15:21,074
It's complicated?

649
01:15:23,090 --> 01:15:24,562
In the car a bit earlier,

650
01:15:24,594 --> 01:15:27,027
you said it's
complicated, but you,

651
01:15:28,562 --> 01:15:30,226
didn't really tell me why so.

652
01:15:33,074 --> 01:15:35,186
It's hard to
know where to start.

653
01:15:40,210 --> 01:15:41,010
Right here?

654
01:15:42,258 --> 01:15:43,058
Okay.

655
01:15:49,171 --> 01:15:53,971
Okay, I was at a traffic
light on December 29th.

656
01:15:58,450 --> 01:16:01,747
There wasn't anything
special about the light,

657
01:16:01,778 --> 01:16:04,563
other than the fact that it
hadn't changed in 10 minutes.

658
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:09,395
I thought about just
driving through,

659
01:16:09,427 --> 01:16:12,338
but couldn't see if
any cars were coming.

660
01:16:13,362 --> 01:16:14,354
So I just waited.

661
01:16:19,186 --> 01:16:23,986
It's dangerous waiting, it
gives you time to think.

662
01:16:31,794 --> 01:16:34,802
My doctor gave me a
lot to think about.

663
01:16:38,930 --> 01:16:43,730
Like why breathing
had become a chore,

664
01:16:46,354 --> 01:16:48,146
and not just something
that happened.

665
01:16:50,226 --> 01:16:55,026
And why pretty soon,
I wouldn't be able to.

666
01:16:59,890 --> 01:17:03,987
All at once, I
realized how temporary

667
01:17:04,019 --> 01:17:06,482
my stupid little existence was.

668
01:17:07,891 --> 01:17:12,466
And I became, painfully aware
of every moment I was wasting,

669
01:17:15,378 --> 01:17:18,098
just sitting there at
a broken traffic light.

670
01:17:20,307 --> 01:17:21,458
So...

671
01:17:23,347 --> 01:17:27,762
I look both ways,
worked up the courage

672
01:17:27,794 --> 01:17:30,706
and drove on through.

673
01:17:40,339 --> 01:17:41,138
So yeah.

674
01:17:48,626 --> 01:17:50,163
I don't know what to say.

675
01:17:51,859 --> 01:17:52,658
It's okay.

676
01:17:56,787 --> 01:17:57,907
You ready?

677
01:17:57,938 --> 01:17:58,739
Yeah.

678
01:18:12,754 --> 01:18:13,842
What about you?

679
01:18:15,314 --> 01:18:16,209
What's your story?

680
01:18:21,490 --> 01:18:22,290
I don't.

681
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:24,945
I don't like it.

682
01:18:28,754 --> 01:18:29,745
I told you mine.

683
01:18:42,803 --> 01:18:43,794
Do you want to dance?

684
01:18:49,523 --> 01:18:50,579
Okay, sure.

685
01:19:27,249 --> 01:19:28,818
You could always stay.

686
01:19:28,851 --> 01:19:29,939
What?

687
01:19:29,971 --> 01:19:30,771
Nothing.

688
01:19:59,058 --> 01:20:01,362
I think I should get some rest.

689
01:20:03,794 --> 01:20:04,594
Yeah, okay.

690
01:20:06,419 --> 01:20:07,634
I'll go.

691
01:20:13,074 --> 01:20:14,610
Your room.

692
01:20:14,641 --> 01:20:15,410
Thank you.

693
01:20:19,122 --> 01:20:19,923
In the morning.

694
01:20:24,563 --> 01:20:26,194
I'll tell my story
in the morning.

695
01:20:27,794 --> 01:20:28,945
Looking forward to it.

696
01:20:35,922 --> 01:20:36,721
Night.

697
01:21:11,089 --> 01:21:12,498
Amera looked down.

698
01:21:15,698 --> 01:21:18,514
The red, blue and
green lights glitched.

699
01:21:20,529 --> 01:21:23,761
She watched her boots
flicker until they failed,

700
01:21:23,795 --> 01:21:24,786
and then it was dark.

701
01:21:26,771 --> 01:21:29,586
She was among the
stars, above the world.

702
01:21:31,378 --> 01:21:34,707
She watches night after
night, day after day,

703
01:21:34,738 --> 01:21:38,994
and, and forever she stayed.
