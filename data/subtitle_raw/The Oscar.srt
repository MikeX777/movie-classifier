1
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:50,000
Ladies and gentlemen
for the annual academy awards,

2
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:53,003
truly the big night
for the people in Hollywood.

3
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,070
- Frankie, over here, please.
- Hey, Johnny, how are you?

4
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,210
Fine, nice to see you
and, ladies and gentlemen,

5
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:02,174
here's a fella who needs
no introduction, Frankie Fane,

6
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:03,634
one of the five nominees

7
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,720
for this year's
best actor award.

8
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:08,260
Well, Frankie, how does it feel
to be up for your first Oscar?

9
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,178
Oh, like a ton of butterflies.

10
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:12,939
Well, it's no secret too
that the surveys and polls

11
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,269
reveal you as the favorite.

12
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,150
What do you have
to say about that?

13
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,257
I'm sure the academy members
have voted for the performance

14
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,942
they believe to be the best.

15
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,636
We'll just have to wait
until the envelope is open

16
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,866
to see who that is.

17
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,321
Well, Frankie, good luck inside.

18
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,848
- Thank you, Johnny.
- Thank you very much.

19
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,238
Ladies and gentlemen,
much excitement here.

20
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,703
The big night
for the people in Hollywood,

21
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,494
the annual academy awards
presentation.

22
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,112
Thank you very much.

23
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:06,514
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,

24
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:09,371
and welcome to
the annual academy awards show.

25
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,281
This is Hollywood's big night,

26
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,791
so, naturally, we're holding it
in Santa Monica.

27
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,084
I'm emceeing the awards
because they wanted someone

28
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,250
who could lose and keep smiling,

29
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:24,136
and I... and I've had
the most practice.

30
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,473
This night means a lot
to everyone

31
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,054
in the movie industry.

32
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,845
This is the night
war and politics are forgotten

33
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,889
and we find out
who we really hate.

34
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,357
You finally made it, Frankie.

35
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,991
Oscar night.

36
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,153
And here you sit
on top of a glass mountain

37
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:50,821
called success.

38
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,239
You're one of the chosen five,

39
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,728
and the whole town
is holding its breath

40
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:55,288
to see who won it.

41
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,419
It's been quite a climb,
hasn't it, Frankie?

42
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,295
Down at the bottom
scuffling for dimes

43
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:00,547
in those smokers.

44
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:04,676
All the way to the top,
magic Hollywood.

45
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,552
Ever think about it?

46
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,338
I do, friend Frankie.

47
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,471
I do.

48
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,975
What am I talking about,
friends?

49
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,481
The good nights and the bad.

50
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:21,439
The cheap motels
and the postponed meals.

51
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,194
It was a rough way
to make a living,

52
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,650
but it was a living.

53
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,985
And it was all for one
and one for all.

54
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,151
You, me...

55
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:32,742
The best thing
your watery eyes ever set up.

56
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,656
And Laurel.

57
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:38,622
I'm talking about art,
that's a-r-t!

58
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,754
You were quite a spieler,
Frankie.

59
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,586
You had to keep those guys
under control.

60
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,461
Gentlemen, gentlemen,

61
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,721
what you're about to see
is a form of art,

62
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,552
art that comes to you
from way back

63
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,683
in the dawn of time,
from that first little bit

64
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,719
of art they called Eve.

65
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,637
The kind of round and warm art

66
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,397
that made that
old snake serpent,

67
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:02,024
that the blind stagger started
crawling around backwards.

68
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,186
I'm talking about
Helen of Troy, man,

69
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,820
about Cleopatra.

70
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:09,529
I'm talking about woman,
friends.

71
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,443
I'm talking about miss Laurel,

72
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,532
the one and only hip-switching,

73
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,664
nice walking bunch of loveliness

74
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,324
you're gonna see right now.

75
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,288
Let's hear it for miss Laurel!

76
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,602
Hey, we did all right out there.

77
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,649
- What's this?
- I'm sorry, boys,

78
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,651
I had some heavy expenses.

79
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,007
You're gonna have
some heavy trouble

80
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,300
unless you come up with the rest

81
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,551
of the scratch you owe us,
mister.

82
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,281
There ain't gonna be no trouble.

83
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,409
You see, the sheriff
happens to be my partner.

84
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:17,990
You got a little egg
on your face.

85
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,451
Just don't stand around
and let it drip into your shoes.

86
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,616
- Now beat it.
- You fat honey-dripper.

87
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,125
Come up with the rest
of our money

88
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,751
or I'll strip the lard
off your ugly...

89
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,256
Pretty?

90
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,752
Pretty, pretty?

91
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,555
Pretty, pretty, pretty?

92
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,635
Blackmail.

93
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,266
Don't!

94
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,521
Frankie!

95
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:06,539
You know, it would've been nice
if I had time to change.

96
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,954
All right now, we've left
the Clinton city limits.

97
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,714
Would you mind telling me
what the rush was all about?

98
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,842
- We had some trouble.
- What kind of trouble?

99
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,297
I had to lay the landlord out.

100
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:18,713
He tried to stiff us
for the money.

101
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,553
Uh-oh, here it comes.

102
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,245
- Your name Fane?
- Yes, sir.

103
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,371
Uh-huh.

104
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,577
Resisting arrest.

105
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,088
Sheriff, you've got us
tuned in all wrong.

106
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,341
Ledbetter tried to cut us
out of our money.

107
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,923
What's t.C. Got to do
with all of this?

108
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,884
I thought you picked us up
for... for knocking him around.

109
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,175
Are you kidding?

110
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,093
You're down in our books
for prostitution

111
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,181
and procuring.

112
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,938
For what?

113
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,190
You know, you're a dirty fella.

114
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,147
You're downright unclean.

115
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,561
Prostitution.

116
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,276
What have we got to do
with prostitution?

117
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:20,408
Hymie Kelly.

118
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,195
Where'd you get the name
Kelly, hymie?

119
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:25,330
From my father, Michael Kelly,

120
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,242
and he got it from his father,
Timothy Kelly.

121
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,955
And my mother's name
was Sadie rabinowitz.

122
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:33,087
- Any more questions?
- Don't let him bug ya, hymie.

123
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,839
Picture is pretty clear.

124
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,375
They cover us with enough dirt,
then nobody can hear us yelling

125
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,906
that the sheriff here
has a nice business

126
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,090
going with ledbetter.

127
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,096
Shut your mouth, fella.

128
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,007
I'm a duly elected official
of this city

129
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,016
and I take my job damn serious.

130
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,303
You stole our money
pretty damn serious too.

131
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:51,314
Shut up!

132
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:55,728
Now if you're itching for
a bruising, keep scratching.

133
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,317
Well, you really fixed
things up fine this time.

134
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,697
Now, tell me, how are you gonna

135
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,983
get us out of this thing,
friend Fane?

136
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,556
Cool it, Laurel,
we're in enough trouble.

137
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,116
You're telling me!

138
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:08,248
Do you know what
they've got me booked for?

139
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:09,829
- We know.
- If you'll post

140
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,664
a hundred dollars bail apiece,

141
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:13,669
I might be able to get you
on the road again.

142
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,046
You took all our money!

143
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,501
There you go again, boy.

144
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:19,133
Money? What money
are you referring to?

145
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,465
I don't know nothing
about no money.

146
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,597
We'll have to sell your car.

147
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:27,133
My car? That's all I've got!

148
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,848
This isn't a game of potsie,
Laurel.

149
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,604
He's gonna keep us here
till we grow webbed feet.

150
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:38,152
All right, sell my car.

151
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,988
The price we got for the car

152
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,320
barely gave us enough
to post bail,

153
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:47,032
which we promptly jumped,
and a few bucks to spare.

154
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,663
Laurel wanted to take
a stab at New York,

155
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,872
so we headed for the big town
by bus and thumb.

156
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,582
We finally made it.

157
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,547
The girls work five sets
between 9:00 and 3:00 A.M.

158
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,678
Miss Laurel works
with special music.

159
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,179
Miss Laurel?

160
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,715
You her personal booker, huh?

161
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,099
Who's he, a chauffeur?

162
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,554
Frankie is the spieler.

163
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:11,219
I ain't hiring
a package deal here.

164
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,112
I don't make a dime
in this hole to begin with.

165
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,127
I got my own spieler, I don't
need no second-rate spieler.

166
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,641
She wants to work,
she works alone.

167
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:17,922
Now wait a minute, Mr. grobard.

168
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,561
Frankie here is great.

169
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:21,821
He can hold any kind of
audience down or warm it up.

170
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,606
- Whatever you need.
- Sure.

171
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,070
This ain't some country barn.

172
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,405
- He gets scratched.
- Forget it, hymie.

173
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,036
Like the man says,
this place is a hole.

174
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,893
- Who needs it?
- You got a pretty feisty mouth.

175
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,659
And you got a glass head,
I can see right through it.

176
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,669
That's how I know you're stupid.

177
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,124
I don't want him around here.

178
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,005
He stays away or she don't work.

179
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:41,737
- Now wait a minute...
- Don't say anything, hymie,

180
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,001
don't say a word.

181
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,885
Tonight. Be here 8:30.

182
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,312
Things haven't been going
so good for us

183
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:06,108
the past couple of months,
have they?

184
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,367
What you mean is
I'm not workin'.

185
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,745
So I'm a creep?

186
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,873
You could get a job, Frankie.

187
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,579
It wouldn't kill you.

188
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,752
Tell me all about it.

189
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,334
You twitch your hips
and you think

190
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:22,965
that's ten years
on the road gang.

191
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:26,048
Well, nobody ever gave me a dime
I didn't have to sweat for.

192
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:29,214
So knock off
of this lazy slob routine.

193
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:30,677
You hurt me, Frankie.

194
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,683
Send me a bill.

195
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,484
Well, you heard.

196
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,487
It's a small apartment, Frankie.

197
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,022
I've got to go to work.

198
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,315
But when I come back,

199
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,359
you and me
are gonna have a talk.

200
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:52,324
Sure, if you like
talkin' to yourself.

201
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:00,086
I hate to leave you
by yourself, Frankie.

202
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:01,971
Supposed to be a swingin' party
in the village.

203
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,465
I ots of chicks.

204
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,752
Hymie, take me to the party
with you.

205
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,721
Sure, come on.

206
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,528
Cool.

207
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,322
Man, what a scene. Forget it!

208
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,099
You're entitled to all
the spaghetti and chili

209
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,158
you can scarf.

210
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,448
Which way?

211
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:37,957
Through here.

212
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:09,147
You a tourist or a native?

213
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,533
Take one from column a
and two from column b,

214
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,411
you get an egg roll either way.

215
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,289
I have a feeling I'm not going
to get anywhere with you.

216
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,950
All depends where
you'd like to get.

217
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:24,245
Mostly, I'd like to get alone
with you somewhere.

218
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,708
Get to know you better.

219
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,464
"Get to know you better”
usually means

220
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,341
"I'd like to make a pass
at you." Huh?

221
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,503
Anything wrong with that?

222
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,848
You're wasting your time.

223
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,479
I'm not the kind of woman
who uses sex as a release

224
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,766
or... or even as a weapon.

225
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:47,856
- You always talk like that?
- I try.

226
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,716
Do me a favor, will ya?
Try droppin' it with me.

227
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,401
I'm not that smart.

228
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:55,069
You free thinkers confuse me.

229
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,827
Let me put it this way.

230
00:15:56,873 --> 00:16:00,115
I think I have more to offer
than just my body.

231
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:02,329
Now I understand.

232
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:06,166
I am the end result of
everything I've ever learned,

233
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,547
all I ever hope to be,

234
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:11,710
and all the experiences
I've ever had.

235
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,047
Uh-huh.

236
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,213
How many experiences
have you had?

237
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:18,008
None. But when
the right time comes

238
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,676
I'll be special for some man.

239
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,142
So it's worth waiting for.

240
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:26,524
Most of us have to keep
grabbin' what's handy.

241
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:30,437
Well, I'm not up for grabs.

242
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,105
If a woman doesn't
treasure herself,

243
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,865
how can a man treasure her?

244
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:38,369
You make my head hurt
with all that poetry.

245
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,998
I think you try awfully hard
not to understand people.

246
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:44,580
I'm tryin' to understand you.

247
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:48,163
No, you're not.

248
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:50,628
You're trying to seduce me.

249
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,387
Thank you.

250
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,559
You're welcome.

251
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,862
Have a nice time
after the party?

252
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:14,259
Bamboo shoots
under the fingernails

253
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,274
- were too much for you, huh?
- Hold it!

254
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,055
Come on, you're not gonna
start on me, are you?

255
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,491
- I'm beat!
- From what?

256
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,531
We've been down
this road before.

257
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,869
Why don't we quit arguing
and have a cup of coffee?

258
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:27,285
No, hymie. It's time
to get this talked out

259
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,329
once and for all.
What's there to talk out?

260
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,943
You got yourself a beef
that's makin' a hole

261
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,611
in the back of my head
listening to you whine about it.

262
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,154
But you're gonna listen
to me, Frankie,

263
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,635
because I'm gonna
spell it out for you a-b-c

264
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,342
so you don't misunderstand.

265
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,757
Right here in front of hymie
and god and everyone.

266
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:44,052
Ever since we hit this town
you've been living off me.

267
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:46,266
If you think
I'm gonna work my tail off

268
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,522
so you can run around
with the village chicks...

269
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:51,605
Oh, stop spreading the pollen
around, Frankie, or else!

270
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:52,689
Or else what?

271
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,069
You'll chop my allowance,

272
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:56,071
you'll turn me out
of your warm bed.

273
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:57,527
You're nothin', that's what.

274
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,442
So can that "or else" crap.

275
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,281
Oh, come on, Frankie,
all she wants you to do

276
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,308
is to stop cattin' around,
she's got that much right.

277
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,790
Everybody's got the knife
out tonight, right, kemosabe?

278
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:08,622
Now, you just shut your face,

279
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:12,209
'cause we been together too long
and you owe me too much, man!

280
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,089
You started payin' me
back right now,

281
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:16,196
you wouldn't get even before
this stupid, round-heeled broad

282
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,302
come back into style,
which figures to be never!

283
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,587
Oh, that's it!

284
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,096
That tears it!

285
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:23,474
This is one stupid,
round-heeled broad

286
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,602
who is finished, done,
d-o-n-e, done!

287
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,059
Get the hell out of here,
Frankie, right now.

288
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,393
Out!

289
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,308
You heard me, freeloader.

290
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,943
And don't let the door
hit you in the backside.

291
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:36,945
Out!

292
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,650
Out!

293
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:43,828
To hell with him!

294
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,034
What does he think I am? Dirt?

295
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,043
Every morning I get the feeling
he was gonna leave

296
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,246
two dollars on the dresser
for me.

297
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,378
I am no slut, and nobody,

298
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:55,290
nobody is gonna
treat me like one!

299
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:58,380
I never knew him to be
any other way with a woman.

300
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:02,638
To Frankie, no woman is
any better than his mother.

301
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,550
She didn't care
who she slept with.

302
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,889
He wanted his father
to break away,

303
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,850
so one night he took his father
to this guy's house.

304
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,516
When Frankie and his father
walked in,

305
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,106
his mother was busy with...

306
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:20,398
Well, anyway, the old man
actually blew his brains out.

307
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:22,737
Frankie felt responsible.

308
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:26,371
Try packin' around
that much guilt.

309
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:29,282
Oh, you should have seen Frankie
at that funeral.

310
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,621
He almost killed her.

311
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,959
Frankie and me,
we hit the road together.

312
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:38,750
That's a long time
before we ran into you.

313
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,543
But the way he sees it,

314
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,133
no woman is any better
than his mother.

315
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,635
Hymie...

316
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:52,647
Why did you let Frankie
take me away from you?

317
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:57,352
Well, I knew
that's what you wanted.

318
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,817
Anyhow, I know Frankie.

319
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:04,617
He won't be back.

320
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:05,822
Oh.

321
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,578
Oh, that's lovely.

322
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,707
Oh, that's just lovely.

323
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,328
All these years

324
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:19,169
knocking around
looking for a way out,

325
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,631
not even wanting
very much of anything.

326
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,514
Just a little rest,
some peace and quiet.

327
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,889
I just wanted to be happy.

328
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:36,399
I see other people,
they get happy.

329
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:38,856
I want mine.

330
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:42,112
Is that asking a lot?

331
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,524
And I wanted a kid.

332
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,486
I always wanted a kid.

333
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,698
And what rotten, stinking luck

334
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:54,288
that it's gonna be
Frankie's kid.

335
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:10,098
Listen, Kay, I got
a front table at the Waldorf.

336
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:12,476
Old man kleinmetz stuck me
with some out-of-town buyers.

337
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,308
Good food and good music
and we'll dance a little bit,

338
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,847
and have a few laughs.
How about it?

339
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,016
I'm sorry, sid, I can't.

340
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,979
I have a date. "I can't!"

341
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,690
It's always "I can't.”

342
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:23,445
Ever since that Fane guy
came on the job.

343
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:25,231
What is with you and him?

344
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,741
I don't think my private life
is of any concern of yours.

345
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,368
- Okay, sid?
- I'm not concerned.

346
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,278
I'm just confused.

347
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:32,697
What do you see in him anyway?

348
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,867
A waste of time.

349
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:37,956
Do you mind, sid?

350
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,916
Please.

351
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,876
That Fane guy is nothing!

352
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:43,962
Turning me down for nothing.
She's crazy.

353
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,878
Well, some broads just
ain't got no sense at all.

354
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:59,060
Hi.

355
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,896
I can't offer you a front table
at the Waldorf,

356
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,565
but I'll show you the big town.

357
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:09,404
We'll have Manhattan, the Bronx,

358
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,533
how very lyrical.

359
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,618
Sidney told Mr. kleinmetz
what you did,

360
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:18,626
and I had all I could do
to keep him from firing you.

361
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,377
Why did you bother?

362
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,787
Look, Frankie,
I think it is best

363
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,581
we don't see each other tonight.

364
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:25,124
Besides I have to get
these costumes

365
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,042
down to the theater.

366
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,711
The theater?

367
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,470
Frankie, I'll be late.

368
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:34,429
These are my new designs
for the show.

369
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:35,934
Look, Frankie, please.

370
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,165
These dresses are getting heavy.

371
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,224
I'll carry them for you.

372
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:40,139
I said no.

373
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:43,275
And we're not going out
together tonight.

374
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:46,024
Which subway?

375
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,359
Irt or bmt?

376
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:56,781
Slowly, that's it.

377
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:03,879
Let's go.

378
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,210
- That's good.
- Let's go. Come on.

379
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,841
Terrible.

380
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,781
Since when have you become
an authority on acting?

381
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,215
I don't know anything
about acting.

382
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:12,951
Keep your voice down,
you're embarrassing me.

383
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:14,870
Those two jokers don't know
how to handle a knife.

384
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:17,010
Jab, thrust, that's it.

385
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,552
If they ever get into a rumble,

386
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:21,598
they'd wind up looking
like cheesecloth.

387
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,858
Look at 'em, will ya?
A couple of clowns.

388
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:28,317
Who the devil out there
is making all that noise?

389
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,855
Oh, I'm...

390
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:33,527
I'm sorry about this,
miss cantaro.

391
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:36,286
- It's all right, Bert.
- All right, whoever you are,

392
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:38,197
we're trying to rehearse
up here.

393
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,520
If you don't know how to keep
your mouth shut, then get out.

394
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,125
Bert, he's a friend of mine.

395
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:43,877
I must apologize.

396
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:45,788
All right, Kay.
Get that creep out of here

397
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,423
before I throw him out.

398
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:50,881
Frankie.

399
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:54,172
- Frankie.
- What do you think you're doing?

400
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,930
What are you doing?

401
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:03,060
You got a busy mouth on you,
friend.

402
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,939
Wanna throw this creep out?

403
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:07,692
Start throwin'.

404
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:11,230
Now I'm gonna show you
what a knife is for.

405
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,736
No!

406
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,500
That's how it's done.

407
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,684
Let's get out of here.

408
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,229
You lunatic!

409
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,064
Ya damned kook!

410
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,572
Don't you understand
how you embarrassed me in there?

411
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,852
Who do you think you are,
Frankie,

412
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,491
just who do you think you are?

413
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:06,206
I'm me.

414
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:07,961
And that's plenty good enough.

415
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:10,168
I'm just as good as that
creep salesman at kleinmetz,

416
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,299
or your phony actor friends.

417
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,364
Sometimes I get the feeling,
Frankie, you ought to be

418
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:16,879
chained up with a ring
in your nose.

419
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:19,890
Now, here, I've worked so hard
to get these costumes accepted

420
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,913
and this is the first group
that has given me a chance.

421
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:25,054
You're incorrigible,
you're absolutely incorr...

422
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:26,893
- Oh.
- May I sit down?

423
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,684
Oh, please do.

424
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:31,944
Miss Sophie cantaro,
Mr. Frankie Fane.

425
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:34,446
Hi.

426
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,573
Now, um, about Frankie.

427
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,781
I've already had one lecture
on my bad manners.

428
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,037
What you did on that stage
was very realistic.

429
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,947
Once you've been
on the noisy end of a knife

430
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,895
you don't forget what that guy
looked like comin' at you.

431
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,204
Very impressive.

432
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,040
An actor has to draw
from all his experience.

433
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,795
Oh, miss cantaro,
Frankie isn't an actor.

434
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:52,377
He doesn't belong to our group.

435
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:54,279
And the opinions expressed
were strictly my own,

436
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:56,885
and not necessarily those
of the director, the designer,

437
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,137
or the so-called actors.

438
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:01,094
I see.

439
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:03,384
What do you do?

440
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:05,678
I push a dress cart
in the garment center.

441
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:09,064
Strong back, weak mind.

442
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,646
Do you think you could
tear yourself away long enough

443
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:14,311
for a little stage experience?

444
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,776
Frankie, miss cantaro
is from Hollywood.

445
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:17,860
Swingin'.

446
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,650
And I'm from Ohio.

447
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,113
How many green stamps is that?

448
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:23,028
Frankie, please.

449
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:25,784
I'll just charge that up

450
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:29,702
to Frankie's
youthful exuberance.

451
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:31,586
You can call me Mr. Fane.

452
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:35,591
Frankie, stop being rude
and listen, please.

453
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:39,424
All right, I'll listen.

454
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:41,338
What's on your mind?

455
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:44,554
I'm in New York trying to find
young talent for my studio.

456
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:45,934
What studio?

457
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,469
An important studio.

458
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:50,686
Important enough,
even for you, Mr. Fane.

459
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:54,022
And you want to make me a star,
is that right?

460
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:55,936
Haven't we got this
all backwards?

461
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:59,197
Isn't it me that's supposed
to be hustlin' you?

462
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:03,486
Frankie, you are rude and nasty
and impossible.

463
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:04,779
Absolutely impossible.

464
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,164
Will you stop beating
on my ears!

465
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:09,951
I'm up to here with
all this bring-down.

466
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,994
I'm me. You don't like
what you see,

467
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:14,789
then change the scenery. Go.

468
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:19,877
That's right, go!

469
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:23,013
I'm not good enough, take off.

470
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:28,386
Wait, Kay!

471
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,520
Don't! Come back, please.

472
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,937
I didn't mean that.

473
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:44,155
Why... why do I...

474
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:48,573
Why do I always try to destroy
the people I love?

475
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,490
I've lost her.

476
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:53,786
I lost the only one in the world
who means anything to me.

477
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:57,540
I can't make it without her,
I can't!

478
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:04,880
Ah, Mr. Fane.

479
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,673
Mr. Fane.

480
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:18,231
You can call me Frankie.

481
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:22,068
That's twice in one night
you've impressed me.

482
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:24,733
Oh, I think you'd like
to become an actor.

483
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:25,901
If that's all it takes.

484
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,740
Oh, it takes a lot more.

485
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,074
But if you're willing to learn.

486
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,364
I'm willing to learn.

487
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:32,578
It means you do
exactly as I say.

488
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:34,289
I don't like wasting my time.

489
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:36,795
That makes two of us...

490
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,580
Sophie.

491
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,758
After the night Frankie left
Laurel, I didn't see him.

492
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,547
And word went through
the coffee houses

493
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:50,934
that Sophie cantaro was trying
to make an actor out of him.

494
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:53,061
Frankie was looking
for something,

495
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:56,439
something that made him
hungrier and hungrier.

496
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:59,602
Sophie got him a part
in an off-Broadway show.

497
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:01,941
We went to see the show,
Laurel and I.

498
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,821
We sat in the back.

499
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:04,982
He was good.

500
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:06,195
Don't try to stop me.

501
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:08,327
I'll start. Stay here!

502
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:17,961
How about a nightcap?

503
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,371
You know I don't touch
the stuff.

504
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,735
Besides, you didn't
bring me up here

505
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,670
just for a nightcap.

506
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,211
All right, kappy.

507
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:28,381
- What did you think of him?
- Sophie, my love,

508
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,765
it was a genuine stinker
of a play.

509
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:33,974
Oh, I know the play is a loser,
but it's the boy.

510
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,683
He has all the right instincts

511
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:38,348
and he's learning faster
than I can teach him.

512
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:40,893
Any day now,
he's going to make the big leap

513
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,688
and he's going to need an agent
he can trust.

514
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,573
I'm arranging with the coast
for a screen test.

515
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,655
How about it,
will you handle him?

516
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:51,241
Is there something more
to this boy

517
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,622
than just his talent?

518
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:58,619
Alfred kapstetter,
I'm 42 years old.

519
00:29:58,672 --> 00:29:59,878
Don't be ludicrous.

520
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,505
And me? I'm almost 60

521
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:03,820
and a certain percent
of my money

522
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:06,335
goes to pay
ladies of the evening,

523
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:11,052
not to reserve me a place in
the senior citizen's column.

524
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:14,389
You, you're 42,

525
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:17,930
there are many good minutes
left for you.

526
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:20,690
All right, I have
a full client list right now

527
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:22,476
but I'll take him on.

528
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,110
Good!

529
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,925
Oh, I haven't found anyone
as exciting as this

530
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,564
in years, kappy.

531
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,073
I want him to be my discovery.

532
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,701
It's very important to me.

533
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:35,365
Is it... is it possible
he's too important?

534
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,604
Kenneth, you ran Frankie's
screen test three times.

535
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,308
Why can't you give us an answer?

536
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,478
Note to the budget department:
I have not yet received

537
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,233
the cost breakdown sheets
for the second unit in Rome.

538
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,769
I want those figures
immediately.

539
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,733
I think his basic strength
came through

540
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,739
quite effectively, Kenneth.

541
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:10,900
What do you think about it?

542
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,692
Note to art department:

543
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:14,532
The sets for "timbuktu"
are still standing.

544
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,993
Why can't they be revamped
for "the mongol horde?"

545
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:19,704
Kenneth, what is your decision?

546
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:21,118
No.

547
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:23,287
That's what my sense
tells me, no.

548
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,126
Something is not right with him.

549
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:27,291
If kappy walks out of here
without a contract

550
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:30,177
and signs him up at Metro...

551
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:31,507
Why you pushing me, Sophie?

552
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,547
Very, very simple,
he's a new talent,

553
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,307
and Sophie brought him to you,
that makes our first obligation.

554
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:38,639
You, you want your dollar,
it rides with Fane,

555
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:41,475
so you bow and murmur to me
all the words

556
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:43,356
you think I want to hear:

557
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:46,109
Vitality, dynamic personality,

558
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,611
good box office.

559
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:52,741
And you sense time passes,
no stars have come your way.

560
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:56,157
I just hope you're telling me
a little truth.

561
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:57,787
I never know with either of you.

562
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,789
Kenneth, this is
all foolishness.

563
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:01,291
Yes, foolishness.

564
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,247
Once in a while
when the weather is cooler,

565
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:04,536
and you move a little faster,

566
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,500
you bring me meat
like this meat.

567
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:10,509
It all has different names,
prime rib of Gloria,

568
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:13,546
shoulder cut of Johnny,
filet Fane meat.

569
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,680
I've been with the studio
a lot of years, Kenneth,

570
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,841
and I know what I'm doing.

571
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:21,853
Frankie is the best potential
I have ever uncovered for you.

572
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:25,106
There is something I miss
in Fane's performance.

573
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:28,189
I can't identify it.
It disturbs me.

574
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,030
All right, I'll pick up
the option on him.

575
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,074
I'll notify
the legal department.

576
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,913
No rush, Kenneth.

577
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,169
Your word is good enough for me.

578
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:57,005
Note to Regan: Nice meeting you.

579
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:59,925
We'll have to get together
again sometime.

580
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:11,732
It was quite a while
since I'd seen Frankie,

581
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:14,818
but the telegram he sent
was as if it were yesterday.

582
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:17,780
He had no doubt
that I would come, and I did.

583
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,320
As tight as he was
with some people out here,

584
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:21,829
he was still alone.

585
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:23,661
He had called me
because he needed me,

586
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,075
as simple as that.

587
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,493
It was a new world

588
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:29,504
and he needed a friend
alongside.

589
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:32,541
He was living in a posh place
just off the strip.

590
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:34,425
It was a far cry from the motels

591
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:36,007
we used to crawl into.

592
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:39,173
It had hot and cold
running everything.

593
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:40,932
He introduced me to the troops

594
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,684
as his public relations man
from New York.

595
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,937
Out here, nobody walks around
without a title,

596
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,597
so that was mine.

597
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:51,394
I came, I saw, and he conquered.

598
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,357
It was the same Frankie.

599
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:57,615
A little more tanned,
more assured, better dressed,

600
00:33:57,661 --> 00:34:00,528
but the same Frankie.

601
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,738
Wow! What a pad!

602
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,453
This is the place, hymie.

603
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:08,494
It's like Hollywood
was waitin' for me.

604
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:11,664
You'll bunk here on the duo-bed.

605
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,206
Hang your stuff in there.

606
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,376
Hey, are there always
that many broads around?

607
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:16,508
Wait till the weekend!

608
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,216
Hey, I'm gonna like it here.

609
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:21,348
Speakin' of broads,
whatever happened to Laurel?

610
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:22,553
I married her.

611
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,263
Oh yeah?

612
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,018
How is she?

613
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,895
She died.

614
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,441
What'd you say?

615
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,853
I said she died.

616
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,326
Hey, get into some trunks,
then we'll go pick ourselves

617
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:43,908
a couple of goodies
from poolside.

618
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,958
You're late!

619
00:34:58,513 --> 00:34:59,923
Mr. Fane.

620
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:02,214
You're late!

621
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:10,605
- What's this?
- It's usually called a camera.

622
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,986
Full length.

623
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,319
All right, Mr. Fane.

624
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:25,703
Let's get a few things straight

625
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:28,161
before we're seen
on the street together.

626
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:31,451
Now, in as much as this date
was set up through the studio

627
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,916
by our respective
publicity managers,

628
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,752
you can put your suave
masculine charm in escrow

629
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,042
for the night.

630
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:41,131
We either do it
by the ground rules

631
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:43,092
or we don't do it.

632
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,301
Ground rules?

633
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:45,887
One.

634
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:49,052
When they ask for autographs,
this is my scene.

635
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,141
You play straight man.

636
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:52,271
Two.

637
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:53,898
You keep your mouth shut

638
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,774
when the columnists
ask questions.

639
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,651
Oh, I'll spell Fane properly,

640
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:01,485
but I don't like grabbers
so don't volunteer any remarks.

641
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,240
Can I bark once in a while

642
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,948
so as they'll know
I haven't stopped breathing?

643
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,409
Oh, it's terrible!

644
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:10,494
All wrong.

645
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:11,999
Oh.

646
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,006
Ground rule number three.

647
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,472
I photograph best
from my left side,

648
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:32,183
so stay on my right
at all times.

649
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:34,223
Four. Don't try
to drop any hints

650
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:37,813
about our big romance
to the fan magazines.

651
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:43,273
One pinkie on my thigh
and they'll be mailing you

652
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:47,239
back to pocatello,
or wherever you come from,

653
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,574
in an envelope.

654
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,410
Is that all?

655
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:54,201
You're the one
who needs to be seen.

656
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:56,666
Take it or leave it.

657
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:02,130
Ah, perfect, just perfect!

658
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:07,006
My wrap is on the chair.

659
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,024
That's your car?

660
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,234
About twelve more payments.

661
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:25,524
Call William.

662
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,863
Tell him to bring
the continental around.

663
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,128
Miss barker?

664
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,381
Thank you.

665
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,321
Miss barker, anything to say
about your next picture?

666
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:45,926
Oh, the studio is
just pleading with me

667
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,462
to do a picture
with Jack lemmon,

668
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,115
but I really haven't
made up my mind yet.

669
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:50,745
Who's the gentleman
you're with, miss barker?

670
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,455
Oh, don't get me wrong,
I respect Mr. lemmon,

671
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:53,969
I think he's a marvelous actor.

672
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:55,387
It's just that I feel
I should wait

673
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,896
until the right script
comes along.

674
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,252
The gentleman you're with,
miss barker.

675
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,686
What's his name?

676
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,442
My last picture was
so terribly exhausting

677
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:02,944
I really feel I need a rest,

678
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,854
but the studio is spending
a million dollars

679
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:06,614
to exploit it
so I have agreed to travel

680
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:07,944
to several of the openings.

681
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,609
This way, miss barker, please!

682
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,198
Hold it, miss barker.

683
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:13,033
Excuse us, fellas,
but miss barker has to go

684
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:15,539
rest her mouth a while,
she's been talking all evening.

685
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:20,503
Frankie wanted the town
to be aware he was alive

686
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,209
and he knew how to do it.

687
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,839
Man, he wanted
to swallow Hollywood

688
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:25,421
like a cat with a canary.

689
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,801
And he did it.

690
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,508
The parts got bigger,
and Frankie was hooked.

691
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,263
Like a junkie
shooting pure quicksilver

692
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,765
into his veins.

693
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,847
Frankie got turned
on the wildest narcotic

694
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:37,433
known to mortal man: Success.

695
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,848
And he needed larger
and larger doses.

696
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:41,186
As the years went by,

697
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:43,352
it became part of his life
like air.

698
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:45,315
The attention, the recognition.

699
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:47,321
Now he was somebody.

700
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:48,698
He was always too hungry.

701
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:51,200
Too much and too far
ahead of himself.

702
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:53,487
He bought a rolls
before he could afford it.

703
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,451
He bought the mansion
in bel air.

704
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,240
He went the route.

705
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:58,908
The interiors were
from the best shops

706
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:00,293
on decorators row.

707
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:03,671
Even Sam the houseboy
was imported.

708
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:07,208
Frankie played the part
for real, the whole image.

709
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:09,423
He had arrived.

710
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,588
Tell hymie to make me a drink.

711
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:16,184
- Bwana wants a drink.
- I heard.

712
00:39:16,229 --> 00:39:18,265
He's in a funky mood today.

713
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,554
Well, you know the pattern.

714
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,188
Every time he starts
a new picture,

715
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:23,225
snarly Fane, the boy-faced dog.

716
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:30,732
Fane residence.

717
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,400
Miss Cheryl barker.

718
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,193
Butter would melt in her mouth.

719
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:36,408
Why not? She's got a hot mouth.

720
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:41,584
It's Cheryl barker.
What should I tell her?

721
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:44,666
Tell her I've got
my own ground rules.

722
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:46,377
Hi, Cheryl?

723
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:50,044
Frankie says he has
his own ground rules.

724
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,256
Okay, I'll tell him.

725
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:53,171
What'd she say?

726
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,327
She musta found it written
in the ladies' room somewhere

727
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:56,557
come on, let's go.

728
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:58,594
Regan may have another coronary.

729
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,223
Yes, sir, Mr. Fane.

730
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:06,017
Wally!

731
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,075
Mr. Fane, I've just been
assigned to your picture.

732
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:13,403
Fine, Wally, hop in.
The wardrobe's in the back.

733
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:15,284
We're taking it over
to my dressing room.

734
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:34,296
Kay bergdahl, sketch artist.

735
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:35,759
Studio brought her
out from New York

736
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,844
to work for Edith head.

737
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:40,055
Okay? Let's go.

738
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:13,794
Let's go inside, Frankie.

739
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:16,007
Cool it.

740
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:25,597
This way, Mr. Fane, please.

741
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:28,399
Thank you.

742
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:35,110
Oh, Frankie,
isn't that hedda hopper?

743
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:38,614
Would you care for
something from the bar?

744
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:40,949
Yes, I'd like
a double vodka gimlet,

745
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:44,332
and a huge, I mean huge
green goddess salad.

746
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:46,709
I just love green goddess salad.

747
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,790
You will make it
that special way for me,

748
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,376
won't you, Pierre?

749
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:52,040
Scotch and water for me.

750
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:54,835
And tone it down to
a 20 decibel war hoop.

751
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:56,673
Hedda can hear you.

752
00:41:56,723 --> 00:41:59,214
You know, that's getting to be
a lousy habit of yours.

753
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:03,556
Leaving me standing alone and
not paying any attention to me.

754
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:06,812
You know, I really... oh...

755
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:09,440
Really, Frankie, I just love
going out with you.

756
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:10,565
And look who's here!

757
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:11,771
Hello, hedda.

758
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:14,403
- Hello. Hello, Frankie!
- Hello, hedda.

759
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:17,441
Anything going between you two
I should have for the column?

760
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:20,235
Oh really, hedda,
you're embarrassing us.

761
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:21,698
If there's anything at all,

762
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:23,534
you'll be the first to know it.

763
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:24,914
Thank you.

764
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,870
There's nothing.

765
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,955
Frankie and I are just
inseparable good friends,

766
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:30,165
that's all.

767
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,829
We're nothing.

768
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:37,009
Once you've gone out
with Frankie,

769
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:39,637
why, there's just
nobody else in Hollywood.

770
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:45,343
I just think Frankie is
the most dynamic man

771
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,932
I've ever dated.

772
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,346
She's nothing.

773
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,855
Excuse me, hedda.

774
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:55,148
Frankie has the most marvelous
sense of humor.

775
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:57,735
Darling,
your laughter is showing.

776
00:42:57,784 --> 00:42:59,365
Bye!

777
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:26,827
You've got your own date,
Frankie.

778
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:45,463
Listen, buster.

779
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:46,801
When somebody dates me,

780
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:48,091
they better know that I require

781
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:49,759
a lot of attention.

782
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:57,020
That oughta get you
some attention.

783
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:33,681
How long have you been out here?

784
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,187
A few months.

785
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:38,691
Don't you call your friends?

786
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,977
I called my friends, Frankie.

787
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:43,237
I want to talk to you, Kay.

788
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:45,398
It's important.

789
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,868
I'll make a deal with you.

790
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:52,826
One hour, cup of coffee,

791
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,831
and I'll show you
the most unusual restaurant

792
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:56,788
you've ever seen.

793
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:59,419
Look, Frankie,
I'm tired, and I...

794
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,205
Come on.

795
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:04,126
Please.

796
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:06,510
Please?

797
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:18,643
Why are we stopping here?

798
00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:20,524
You said coffee,
or a restaurant.

799
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,405
Come on aboard.

800
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,112
Come on.

801
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,625
It's a beautiful boat, Frankie.

802
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:40,127
Remember me when
I was pushing a rack

803
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:42,879
through the snow on 28th street?

804
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:45,382
I remember many things, Frankie.

805
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:48,420
I'd like to get you
to forget some of them.

806
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:50,133
Listen, Kay.

807
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:52,423
I was a punk
without a subway token.

808
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,592
It couldn't have gone
anywhere with us.

809
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,260
It's different now.

810
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:57,850
What are you talking about?

811
00:46:57,898 --> 00:46:59,263
I'm talking about us.

812
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:00,807
Us.

813
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:03,476
There's no us.

814
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:06,441
There's you and there's me.

815
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:07,946
There's no us.

816
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:09,482
That's not true.

817
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:11,400
There is something
between us, Kay.

818
00:47:11,454 --> 00:47:13,115
It may not have been right
in New York,

819
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:16,281
but there were things
happening between us always.

820
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:18,871
You can't deny that.

821
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:21,126
Well, you're not exactly
the kind of man

822
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:25,415
any woman could call
a passing fancy.

823
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:27,299
There's nothing happening
between us,

824
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:29,927
now any more than before.

825
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:32,554
It was the Princess
and the pauper then.

826
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,512
I didn't have anything
to offer you.

827
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,392
But now it's different.

828
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,522
Don't con me, Frankie.

829
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:44,183
Offer me.

830
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:46,898
What were you ever
going to offer me?

831
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:50,064
The chance to fight you off
every time we got together?

832
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,857
So, fine, now you got the yacht

833
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:54,243
and you got cars, and...

834
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:58,122
They save the best table for you
at the best restaurants.

835
00:47:58,167 --> 00:48:00,123
So what?

836
00:48:00,169 --> 00:48:02,125
You haven't changed.

837
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:05,413
It's that seed of rot
inside of you

838
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:07,422
which makes you what you are,

839
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:09,709
that you can't change.

840
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:11,468
You just dress it better.

841
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:16,549
Now I get it.

842
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:18,342
I think I understand.

843
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:20,352
Maybe it's that thing inside me,

844
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:23,140
that rot, that evil
you think you see.

845
00:48:23,192 --> 00:48:25,649
Maybe that's what turns you on.

846
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:26,934
Take me home, Frankie.

847
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,318
You slapped my face
the first time

848
00:48:28,364 --> 00:48:29,774
I made a pass at you.

849
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:31,468
But you got me a job
that kept me near you.

850
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:32,948
Every time I tried to get close,

851
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:34,949
you pushed me away,
but not too far.

852
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:36,735
Oh, that middle European

853
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:38,745
peasant upbringing
of yours, baby.

854
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:39,906
They told you so often

855
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:41,395
that playing house
with a guy was dirty,

856
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:44,206
you got all knotted up inside.

857
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:46,166
But you like to play.

858
00:48:46,215 --> 00:48:49,332
So you can't get turned on
by a guy who treats you nice,

859
00:48:49,385 --> 00:48:52,297
a schlep like the one
you were out with tonight.

860
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:55,429
But a guy
who wipes his feet on you?

861
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:57,260
That, you dig.

862
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:58,389
Shut up!

863
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:04,434
You just want me
because I won't let you use me

864
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:06,189
like all the others.

865
00:49:06,235 --> 00:49:08,191
Because I'm not like
all the others.

866
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:12,071
You represent
everything I loathe, Frankie.

867
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:15,358
You mean everything you love.

868
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:17,447
Take me home.

869
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:18,861
Take me home!

870
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:23,540
Right away.

871
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:41,259
Well.

872
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:43,678
Hello, stranger.

873
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:03,656
Stop! Just stop.

874
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:05,791
What is this all about?

875
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,451
Is there something
eating you, lady?

876
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:09,245
What should be eating me?

877
00:50:09,298 --> 00:50:12,256
That I haven't seen you
in almost two months?

878
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:14,713
That Sam or hymie tell me
you've gone to tierra del fuego

879
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:16,298
when I call?

880
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:18,074
That you should appear
suddenly out of the night

881
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,884
and expect me to play
lady bountiful

882
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:22,016
to your world-weary carcass?

883
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:23,801
Oh, should I be disturbed?

884
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,721
Heaven forbid,
Frankie Fane, sir.

885
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:28,454
I don't know what the hell
your problem is,

886
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:32,443
but whatever it is,
just forget it.

887
00:50:32,488 --> 00:50:34,524
I mean, I feel lousy,
I'm drivin' around,

888
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:35,858
I find myself here,

889
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:37,569
so I come in for a drink
and a cigarette.

890
00:50:37,618 --> 00:50:40,075
You're jumpin' salty all over me
before I get my shoes off.

891
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,485
Exactly the point, Frankie,

892
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:43,871
before you get your shoes off.

893
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:46,202
Didn't you ever think to ask?

894
00:50:46,252 --> 00:50:50,120
Just once, say please or may I?

895
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:54,957
Oh, Frankie, Frankie,

896
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:58,127
you really don't understand,
do you?

897
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,920
I don't know why
I keep expecting you

898
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:01,965
to act like other men
when you're not.

899
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:05,259
You're another kind of machine
entirely.

900
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:07,052
Do you bleed?

901
00:51:07,106 --> 00:51:09,017
Do you cry?

902
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:13,560
No, Sophie, I don't care
about anything that much.

903
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:15,853
Don't go.

904
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,771
We'll talk.

905
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:25,363
Don't break a leg
getting out of here.

906
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:28,032
What's that supposed to mean?

907
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:31,122
I didn't know we considered
meanings, Frankie.

908
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:34,163
I thought you and I went
strictly by instinct.

909
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:36,377
You got a bug again.

910
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:41,091
No bug, just a middle-aged
woman's rosary,

911
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,847
a bead for each year,

912
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:46,759
six with your name on them.

913
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:48,790
You know, I think you go
a little soft in the gourd

914
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:50,429
early in the morning.

915
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:52,347
Look at me when you talk to Mel

916
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:54,858
I'm not some sort of garbage
pail you can slam a lid on

917
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:56,393
and walk away.

918
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:59,063
- What the hell is all this?
- Let me tell you about hell,

919
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:01,448
about being a silly woman
who needs to feel

920
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:03,074
she belongs to someone,

921
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,032
even someone as empty
as you are, Frankie.

922
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:08,413
'Cause you're not real,
you're some sort of dream,

923
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:10,950
some sort of fog that comes
drifting in here at night

924
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:12,584
and out again in the morning.

925
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:14,211
You get as good as you give,
Sophie.

926
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:16,087
Nobody breaks your arm.

927
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:18,749
Oh, no, nobody breaks my arm.

928
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:21,464
That's the pathetic thing
about me.

929
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:24,175
But you, Frankie, oh,
you're something else again,

930
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:25,634
you're really something else.

931
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:28,642
You go after what you want...
And in some men it's admirable...

932
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:31,804
In you, it's unclean!

933
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:34,439
I don't know what the hell
you're gibbering about.

934
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:38,194
No, no, I know you don't.

935
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:39,648
Oh, go on.

936
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:40,938
Go on and get out of here.

937
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,322
That's what you want to do
anyway,

938
00:52:42,368 --> 00:52:44,054
you want get out of here
without having to look at me.

939
00:52:44,078 --> 00:52:46,239
So, go on, go on!

940
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:50,156
I'm going, old lady.

941
00:52:50,209 --> 00:52:52,120
But let's make this
the last stand.

942
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:54,125
Let's make this the one
that wraps it up.

943
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,332
Fade out.

944
00:52:56,382 --> 00:52:58,122
Bye, Frankie.

945
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:00,040
Close the door behind you.

946
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:01,755
Let me get some sleep.

947
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:14,313
- Steve marks, how are you?
- How are you, Frankie?

948
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:16,336
Haven't seen you since we did
that thing together at Metro.

949
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,725
Yeah, it's good
seeing you again.

950
00:53:17,778 --> 00:53:19,063
Haven't seen kappy kapstetter,

951
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:20,319
I'm supposed to meet him here.

952
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:22,400
Yes, he's in a booth
in the back.

953
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:27,947
Kappy.

954
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:29,861
Hi, frank.

955
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:31,246
I'd ask you to join us, Steve,

956
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:33,327
but we have some business
to discuss.

957
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:36,961
Would you care for a drink
before dinner?

958
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:40,293
Ah, no, thanks, Steve.

959
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,756
Maitre d'.

960
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:47,091
What happened?
He was a good actor.

961
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:48,847
Made more pictures than I have.

962
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,848
This is a chancy business,
Frankie.

963
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,430
You never know
you're on the way out

964
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,359
till you suddenly realize
it would take a ticket

965
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:55,934
to get back in.

966
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:57,689
Would you care
to order dinner now?

967
00:53:57,735 --> 00:53:59,191
Oh.

968
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:01,522
Frankie.

969
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:02,857
Frankie!

970
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,862
You want to order dinner now?

971
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,523
Squab and wild rice.

972
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:08,818
I'll have the same, thanks.

973
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:10,987
Well, what brings you
to the valley

974
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:13,155
to see me over
squab and wild rice?

975
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:14,948
I want you to do something
for me.

976
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:17,914
The studio brought out a girl
named Kay bergdahl.

977
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:19,828
- Is she an actress?
- No, they brought her out

978
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:22,248
to work under Edith head
as a sketch artist.

979
00:54:22,301 --> 00:54:24,292
I'd like her to be a designer.

980
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:26,380
See to it, will you?

981
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,136
"See to it"?

982
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:30,047
What am I, a genie in a bottle?

983
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,136
Poof, you're a designer?

984
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:34,768
I mean, what right have I got
to go in to Regan

985
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:36,769
and say
make this girl a designer.

986
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:40,273
Would you mind breakin' that
two-buck violin you're playin'?

987
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:42,526
What is this Sincere bit?

988
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:44,937
The fact is
my ten percent before taxes

989
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:47,572
is paying your office overhead.

990
00:54:47,618 --> 00:54:48,778
And you'll stop earning it

991
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:51,534
when you stop giving me
what I want.

992
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:53,491
Tell Regan.

993
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:58,875
How quickly you forget
the beginnings.

994
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:03,171
I just remembered
I'll have to skip dinner.

995
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:05,082
I have a doctor's appointment
in the morning.

996
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:07,968
Kappy!

997
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:10,846
Do it!

998
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:12,677
Then I suppose I'm to make sure

999
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:17,390
miss bergdahl knows it was you
who got her the job?

1000
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:20,397
All in due time, kappy.

1001
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:23,104
All in due time.

1002
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:37,827
Cancel those orders.

1003
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:39,412
Where can I find Steve marks?

1004
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:41,543
Oh, through that door
in the back.

1005
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:53,760
You're gonna have
the soul of a ribbon clerk.

1006
00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:56,050
Inventory.

1007
00:55:56,103 --> 00:55:58,014
Now, marks, I can't promise
a big part...

1008
00:55:58,063 --> 00:55:59,863
I don't have that much to say
about casting...

1009
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:01,751
But a small part, something
with a little juice in it.

1010
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,766
No, no thanks,
I don't want any part.

1011
00:56:03,819 --> 00:56:05,935
You've got
to understand something.

1012
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:07,774
I made the money, I blew it.

1013
00:56:07,823 --> 00:56:09,359
My time passed.

1014
00:56:09,408 --> 00:56:12,650
New kids were coming in
on every bus,

1015
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:14,318
so I died.

1016
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:17,363
I got used to it.

1017
00:56:17,416 --> 00:56:21,500
I don't want to be dug up
like some corpse.

1018
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:25,333
I don't want to have to die
all over again.

1019
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:28,044
No thanks.

1020
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:30,835
How did it happen so fast?

1021
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:32,970
Fast?

1022
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:35,882
Like being stunned by a hammer.

1023
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:37,174
Am I bitter?

1024
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:38,558
Sure I am.

1025
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:42,846
I don't want you to think
this is charity.

1026
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,310
There is nothing wrong
with charity,

1027
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:46,099
I'm not Charlie noble,
I can use the money.

1028
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:48,018
I paid my dues in this town.

1029
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:54,450
Hey, don't fool yourself.

1030
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:57,110
You didn't give me this
out of friendship or charity

1031
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,372
it's fear, Frankie.

1032
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:06,248
It's going to help
bury your fear.

1033
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:21,810
Hi, kappy.

1034
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:23,686
- Hello, hymie.
- Sit down, kappy.

1035
00:57:23,732 --> 00:57:26,394
Hymie, fix kappy
a plate of huevos rancheros.

1036
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,934
Eggs rancheros coming up in
honor of our Mexican friends

1037
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:30,693
below the border.

1038
00:57:30,739 --> 00:57:33,230
Eggs made with chopped
green tomatoes, some chilies,

1039
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:36,320
and a couple of squirts
of Tequila guaranteed to cement

1040
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:38,452
inter-American relations.

1041
00:57:38,497 --> 00:57:40,613
Just orange juice.

1042
00:57:43,085 --> 00:57:44,416
What are you, a guest?

1043
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,201
I revolted when
they said I had to make

1044
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:47,710
a terrible meal like that.

1045
00:57:47,756 --> 00:57:49,997
Icch!

1046
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:52,211
Sunday isn't my idea of a time
for business, Frankie,

1047
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,797
but I wanted to catch you
before you left for Tijuana.

1048
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:56,586
I have a waiver for you to sign.

1049
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,301
What kind of waiver?

1050
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:00,557
One of the attorneys at
the studio's legal department

1051
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:02,058
failed to notify us officially

1052
00:58:02,104 --> 00:58:03,890
that they were picking up
your option.

1053
00:58:03,939 --> 00:58:07,102
It's a technicality,
but Regan wants a waiver signed.

1054
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,516
So what does it mean that
they didn't notify us on time,

1055
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:11,105
I mean legally?

1056
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:14,692
Well, legally it means
if we wanted to take advantage,

1057
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:17,528
we could get
out of the contract.

1058
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:19,192
Sign right here.

1059
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:20,907
No.

1060
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:22,287
What no?

1061
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:23,788
Why no?

1062
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:25,620
Sign, Frankie.

1063
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:28,957
I want you to negotiate
a new contract.

1064
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:30,997
You can't do this.

1065
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:32,880
We've operated by a handshake.

1066
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:34,211
Regan trusts me.

1067
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:35,751
Good faith.

1068
00:58:35,804 --> 00:58:38,011
You can't sandbag him like this.

1069
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:40,368
- That lawyer might lose his job.
- Who are you agenting for,

1070
00:58:40,392 --> 00:58:42,553
me or some kid
out of Harvard law?

1071
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:47,930
I said I want Regan's back
up against the wall.

1072
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:50,648
Hey, Frankie, take it easy.

1073
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:51,774
Listen to kappy.

1074
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:54,857
- Maybe...
- Shut up!

1075
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:56,817
Now?

1076
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:00,741
Remember the day
I sat in that man's office

1077
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:03,119
and he talked about me
like I was meat,

1078
00:59:03,165 --> 00:59:05,952
like I wasn't even there.

1079
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:10,540
Well, now comes payback time.

1080
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:12,750
He has big plans for you,
Frankie.

1081
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,630
Please don't do this
to Regan, please!

1082
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:19,466
Well, it just breaks my heart
to think of poor Regan unhappy.

1083
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:20,924
Do it, kappy!

1084
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:23,386
Tell him I want a better deal
or I walk!

1085
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:27,893
Snake pit.

1086
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:29,304
Hymie Kelly speaking.

1087
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:30,517
Oh, hi.

1088
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,307
Wait a minute,
I'll see if he's up yet.

1089
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:35,397
It's Kay bergdahl.

1090
00:59:35,447 --> 00:59:37,779
I'll take it inside.

1091
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:46,579
Yeah?

1092
00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:50,209
Frankie, um, I called
to tell you two things.

1093
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:52,289
The first is to thank you.

1094
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:53,579
For what?

1095
00:59:53,632 --> 00:59:55,213
For getting me
that designing job.

1096
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:57,715
I was at a party at Mr. Regan's
last night and he told me

1097
00:59:57,761 --> 01:00:00,298
how I got the break.

1098
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:02,008
Thank you, Frankie.

1099
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:04,389
It was a very kind thing to do.

1100
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,174
What's the second thing?

1101
01:00:06,228 --> 01:00:10,437
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry
for what I said on the boat.

1102
01:00:10,482 --> 01:00:13,474
Look, uh, how would you like
to go down to Tijuana

1103
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:15,734
for the bullfights with me
this afternoon?

1104
01:00:15,779 --> 01:00:18,316
Well, I don't know,
Frankie, I...

1105
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:20,651
I'm not about
to hassle with you.

1106
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:21,906
I'm sorry about what I said.

1107
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:23,179
You're sorry
about what you said.

1108
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:24,443
Let's make up.

1109
01:00:24,496 --> 01:00:25,827
You either trust me
or you don't.

1110
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:27,183
You either want to go
or you don't.

1111
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:29,072
Yes or no.

1112
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:30,411
No hassle?

1113
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,542
No hassle.

1114
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:34,828
I'd like to go very much,
Frankie.

1115
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:36,587
Pick you up in an hour.

1116
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:45,259
Attencion!

1117
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:47,845
Seforas, senoritas,
y caballeros,

1118
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:49,304
it is my great pleasure

1119
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:51,936
to introduce our
special guest of honor,

1120
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:53,973
senor frank Fane!

1121
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,863
Matador ruiz losada...

1122
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:07,820
Will dedicate this bull
to senor Fane

1123
01:01:07,873 --> 01:01:09,659
and his lovely senorita.

1124
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:19,631
What does it mean
"dedicate the bull" to you?

1125
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,667
It means they cut the ears
of the dead carcass

1126
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,210
and give them to me.

1127
01:01:23,263 --> 01:01:25,379
That sounds charming.

1128
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:29,223
Olé!

1129
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:31,635
The minute I saw you,
I told little darling,

1130
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:34,145
I said, that's Frankie Fane.

1131
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:35,772
I couldn't believe my eyes.

1132
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:38,103
Frankie Fane
sittin' right next to me.

1133
01:01:38,153 --> 01:01:40,144
Yeah, honey bunny here
recognized you right away,

1134
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:41,528
Mr. Fane.

1135
01:01:41,573 --> 01:01:43,484
Olé!

1136
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,740
Trina here is
one of your biggest fans!

1137
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:47,867
She sees
every one of your shows.

1138
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:48,948
Isn't that right, doll?

1139
01:01:48,997 --> 01:01:50,533
Oh, yeah.

1140
01:01:50,582 --> 01:01:52,493
Nice to know you, trina.
This is miss bergdahl.

1141
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,328
- How are you?
- Hi.

1142
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:56,083
I just adore your pictures.

1143
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:57,289
I saw that one, you know,

1144
01:01:57,339 --> 01:01:59,421
where you play the private eye
three times.

1145
01:01:59,466 --> 01:02:00,797
Honey bunny here
is a private eye,

1146
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:02,082
I guess that's why.

1147
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:03,250
Name is Barney Yale.

1148
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:05,510
I got my own agency in L.A.

1149
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:08,547
Olé!

1150
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,431
Hey, what are you doin'
after the corrida?

1151
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:12,342
Goddess and me got
big things planned.

1152
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:14,807
Thanks, Barney,
but we got plans.

1153
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:17,063
Olé!

1154
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:19,019
Look, we been together now
for three years

1155
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:21,185
and we finally made
the big decision.

1156
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:24,901
Oh, come on, we'd be honored
if you'd be our witnesses.

1157
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:26,406
What d'ya say, miss bergdahl?

1158
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:29,409
Oh, it'd be a thrill to have you
and a big celebrity

1159
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:31,991
like frank Fane
as our witnesses.

1160
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,122
Golly!

1161
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:35,327
Please?

1162
01:02:35,377 --> 01:02:36,708
Frankie, what do you think?

1163
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:39,165
Let's go, huh? I love weddings.

1164
01:02:39,214 --> 01:02:40,454
Weddings?

1165
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:42,213
Who said anything
about weddings?

1166
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:44,625
We came down here
to get a divorce!

1167
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:58,430
And so now with
the power invested in me

1168
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:00,519
I pronounce you divorced.

1169
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:01,808
Okay, sign the papers.

1170
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:03,567
That is fifteen dollars, please.

1171
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:04,853
Thank you, senor.

1172
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:07,113
Fifteen dollars, senor, please.
Por favor.

1173
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:10,992
- Barney Yale!
- Si, Barney, fifteen dollars.

1174
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:12,368
Baby!

1175
01:03:12,414 --> 01:03:14,325
It was miserable
being married to you!

1176
01:03:14,374 --> 01:03:15,989
Honey, it was hell!

1177
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:19,083
Son locos!

1178
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:21,415
Hey, don't you want
to kiss the ex-bride?

1179
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:22,624
Go ahead.

1180
01:03:22,674 --> 01:03:26,166
- Come on!
- Frankie, oh!

1181
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:28,676
Mmm!

1182
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:33,765
Hey!

1183
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,641
The witnesses have to sign
a decree.

1184
01:03:35,687 --> 01:03:37,302
Hey, no, come on.

1185
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:39,767
Have to sign a decree,
makes it very legal.

1186
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,272
Twenty-five dollars, senor.

1187
01:03:41,318 --> 01:03:43,604
Twenty-five?
I thought you said fifteen!

1188
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,769
No, I don't say fifteen.
It's twenty-five dollars.

1189
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,562
You have a lot of papers
to sign, man.

1190
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:49,480
Barney, pay the man.

1191
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:52,401
Oh, all right, okay,
all right, here you go,

1192
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:54,035
go on, it was worth it.

1193
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,490
Muchas gracias, senor.

1194
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:57,300
Listen, lady, I have
some nice watch for you.

1195
01:03:57,334 --> 01:03:58,540
Come on, very nice.

1196
01:03:58,585 --> 01:03:59,729
Come on, come on, the small one.

1197
01:03:59,753 --> 01:04:01,289
- Come on.
- No I've got one.

1198
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:02,953
Okay, listen,
I have a very good deal.

1199
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:04,462
Pasaporte fotografias.

1200
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:05,963
I make you a package deal.

1201
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:08,546
You guys, four for five dollars!

1202
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:35,368
You and Kay are just right
for each other.

1203
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:39,577
Why, it's like an "Alice
in wonderland" kind of thing,

1204
01:04:39,626 --> 01:04:42,709
with you and her
as the prince and Princess.

1205
01:04:42,754 --> 01:04:44,106
There wasn't
any prince and Princess

1206
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:46,041
in "Alice in wonderland.”

1207
01:04:46,091 --> 01:04:50,209
There wasn't any in my marriage
to that stinko Barney either.

1208
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:52,752
Too bad.

1209
01:04:52,806 --> 01:04:56,719
Oh, there's always
Chester tumwater.

1210
01:04:56,768 --> 01:05:00,431
Chester tumwater,
man of my dreams.

1211
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,223
And you know, Barney doesn't
even know I know him.

1212
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:05,981
You're a pretty busy girl.

1213
01:05:06,027 --> 01:05:09,269
He has lots and lots of money
stashed away

1214
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:11,938
in lots and lots of banks.

1215
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:18,282
And he is going to provide me
with comfort and luxury

1216
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:21,744
in my declining years.

1217
01:05:21,793 --> 01:05:26,537
Oh-ho, that Chester
is an operator.

1218
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:29,922
Right now he's operating
on your girlfriend.

1219
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:36,796
Oh, you mean Barney?

1220
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:43,767
Everybody sees Barney,
but I... l see Chester.

1221
01:05:45,984 --> 01:05:47,940
You know,

1222
01:05:47,986 --> 01:05:49,567
I admire you.

1223
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,477
You admire me.

1224
01:05:51,531 --> 01:05:54,944
'Cause you're
a movin' picture star.

1225
01:05:54,993 --> 01:05:57,700
That's what I was gonna be.

1226
01:05:57,745 --> 01:06:00,987
That's why I married
old Chester.

1227
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:03,031
Oh, sugar!

1228
01:06:03,084 --> 01:06:06,247
I mean Barney.

1229
01:06:23,855 --> 01:06:25,436
Hey Frankie, go ahead!

1230
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:27,188
Take her!

1231
01:06:33,156 --> 01:06:35,442
It's too hot in here.

1232
01:06:35,492 --> 01:06:37,653
And too crowded.

1233
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:40,193
And the music's loud.

1234
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:42,111
Too loud.

1235
01:06:42,165 --> 01:06:44,952
I don't like this music, anyhow.

1236
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:49,040
And, uh, Barney might come back
any minute.

1237
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:52,546
There's one or two places
where I'm not black and blue.

1238
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:54,878
And we haven't been alone
all day.

1239
01:06:54,928 --> 01:06:56,668
No, we haven't.

1240
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,851
It's been a lovely day, Frankie.

1241
01:07:12,904 --> 01:07:14,940
Pretty good for me too.

1242
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:18,277
I can't relax this much
around most people.

1243
01:07:18,326 --> 01:07:21,238
Sometimes we do go well
together, don't we?

1244
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:24,120
I go better with you
than any other girl I know.

1245
01:07:26,084 --> 01:07:28,917
Woman I know.

1246
01:07:30,505 --> 01:07:33,087
Which are you, Kay?

1247
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:36,090
Girl or woman?

1248
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:39,844
I'd like to think
that I'm a woman, Frankie.

1249
01:07:53,361 --> 01:07:55,352
Woman.

1250
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:12,452
Spend the night with me
at rosarita beach.

1251
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:20,384
I think I'm in love with you.

1252
01:08:23,141 --> 01:08:26,178
Frankie, I want to go with you
to rosarita,

1253
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:28,343
I want to, I do.

1254
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:36,150
Marry me, Kay.

1255
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:38,151
Marry me, tonight.

1256
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:43,650
And now I pronounce you
man and wife.

1257
01:08:43,703 --> 01:08:47,287
Thirty-five dollars please,
thank you very much.

1258
01:08:47,332 --> 01:08:48,617
Thirty-five?

1259
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:51,078
You only charged me 25
for a divorce.

1260
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:53,083
Senor, this is a deluxe service.

1261
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:55,461
My wife consuela is going
to sing "Carmen carmela."

1262
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:57,087
Yeah, right, sing, sing.
Go ahead.

1263
01:08:57,133 --> 01:09:00,125
Consuela, sing "Carmen carmela."

1264
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:08,225
Oh no, come on,
let's get out of here!

1265
01:09:15,735 --> 01:09:17,600
I'm so happy, darling.

1266
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:20,020
- Love me?
- Mm-hm.

1267
01:09:20,073 --> 01:09:21,654
As much as last night?

1268
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:24,532
Of course.

1269
01:09:24,577 --> 01:09:26,283
Oh, it feels so good.

1270
01:09:26,329 --> 01:09:28,160
I wish we could stay down here
forever.

1271
01:09:28,206 --> 01:09:29,491
It's almost noon.

1272
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:31,155
We should've started back
hours ago.

1273
01:09:31,209 --> 01:09:33,120
But can't we stay
just for a few days?

1274
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:35,034
Nope.

1275
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:36,999
Is there anything wrong,
Frankie?

1276
01:09:37,048 --> 01:09:38,288
Nothing's wrong.

1277
01:09:38,341 --> 01:09:40,502
I just don't have
the time to spend here.

1278
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:41,916
Well, can't you make the time?

1279
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:43,834
It's our honeymoon.

1280
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:45,378
I have to get back to town.

1281
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:47,271
I'm involved in contract trouble
at the studio.

1282
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:49,264
Is that so difficult
to understand?

1283
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:51,301
Now, will you please
get dressed?

1284
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:56,856
Frankie, look at me
when you talk to me.

1285
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:18,207
I'll pay the bill.

1286
01:10:18,256 --> 01:10:20,497
See you downstairs.

1287
01:10:27,265 --> 01:10:29,096
Frankie found himself married

1288
01:10:29,142 --> 01:10:32,475
but he still couldn't change
his feelings about women,

1289
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:34,852
so his only Avenue was escape.

1290
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:36,853
He employed the slimy services

1291
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:39,891
of the hymie Kelly
broad procuring agency.

1292
01:10:39,944 --> 01:10:41,605
I was running out of numbers.

1293
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:44,896
He used them like kleenex,
once and threw 'em away.

1294
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:46,610
I was having trouble
rationalizing

1295
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:49,241
what I was becoming
working for Frankie.

1296
01:10:49,287 --> 01:10:51,243
A garbage collector applies
for a credit card,

1297
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:54,156
calls himself
a sanitation disposal expert.

1298
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:55,994
What could I call myself?

1299
01:10:56,043 --> 01:10:59,706
Kay wouldn't have any trouble
giving it a name.

1300
01:10:59,756 --> 01:11:02,714
Hymie, deep thinker,
explain to me

1301
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:05,375
the ethical structure
of the universe.

1302
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:10,338
Oh, there's nothing wrong
with building a dream castle

1303
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:13,133
unless you try to move into it.

1304
01:11:13,186 --> 01:11:14,517
Kay, why don't you go to bed?

1305
01:11:14,562 --> 01:11:16,177
It's almost three A.M.

1306
01:11:18,483 --> 01:11:21,520
Because my bed is empty
of husband.

1307
01:11:21,569 --> 01:11:23,309
You know what I do, hymie?

1308
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:25,193
I count nights.

1309
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:27,981
I found a freudian substitute
for counting sheep.

1310
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:30,275
I count empty nights.

1311
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:34,195
Where is he, hymie?

1312
01:11:34,248 --> 01:11:36,113
Well, there was a late call
on the set

1313
01:11:36,167 --> 01:11:40,285
and he said he'd have a sandwich
and be home right away.

1314
01:11:40,338 --> 01:11:41,544
You're lying.

1315
01:11:41,589 --> 01:11:42,669
You're lying, hymie.

1316
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:44,501
Why does everybody lie for him?

1317
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:47,041
You, Sam, kappy, all of you.

1318
01:11:48,763 --> 01:11:50,879
Frankie's company
finished at 9:15.

1319
01:11:50,932 --> 01:11:53,469
I called the studio.

1320
01:11:53,518 --> 01:11:57,477
You see, you turned me
into something I always hated,

1321
01:11:57,522 --> 01:12:00,559
a sneaking kind of woman,
a jealous woman,

1322
01:12:00,608 --> 01:12:03,566
a checking-up-on-him
kind of woman.

1323
01:12:03,611 --> 01:12:05,611
Well, he may have stopped off
for a couple of belts

1324
01:12:06,614 --> 01:12:09,777
you know Frankie, he needs
to unlax after a work day.

1325
01:12:13,538 --> 01:12:15,995
Oh, I am sorry, sir,
but you will have to go.

1326
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:19,624
My husband is expected back from
the punic wars any moment now

1327
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:22,706
and he's insanely jealous.

1328
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:24,871
Sam, go run me
a tub of hot water, huh?

1329
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:27,586
- Want something to eat?
- No, I've eaten.

1330
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:34,005
I don't see very much of you
these days, Frankie.

1331
01:12:34,058 --> 01:12:35,923
They're keeping me hopping
at the studio.

1332
01:12:35,977 --> 01:12:37,808
No, no, I mean after work.

1333
01:12:37,854 --> 01:12:40,391
You seem to be able to keep
hopping right through the night.

1334
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:42,771
Hymie, get me an aspirin,
my head's splitting.

1335
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:47,067
And so is our marriage.

1336
01:12:47,113 --> 01:12:49,479
Finding excuses not to come home
at night until I'm asleep

1337
01:12:49,532 --> 01:12:51,134
and leaving in the morning
before I get up,

1338
01:12:51,158 --> 01:12:53,570
no matter how early I get up.

1339
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:55,905
I am married to you, Frankie.

1340
01:12:55,955 --> 01:12:57,820
It means that you come home
after work

1341
01:12:57,874 --> 01:12:59,410
and that we go out together,

1342
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:03,872
and that we raise babies
and make a marriage.

1343
01:13:03,921 --> 01:13:06,913
Whatever you have inside you,
Frankie, doesn't apply to me.

1344
01:13:06,966 --> 01:13:08,957
I am your wife.

1345
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:12,878
There are different kinds
of women.

1346
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:14,886
What do you mean,
whatever I have inside me?

1347
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:16,797
Uh-oh, this time
I'm not in the middle.

1348
01:13:16,851 --> 01:13:18,466
I have nothin' to do with it.

1349
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:21,386
I'm splittin',
I'll see you tomorrow.

1350
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:24,397
Frankie, it is like heat
lightning just before a storm.

1351
01:13:24,442 --> 01:13:27,229
I can smell the rain in the air.

1352
01:13:27,278 --> 01:13:29,064
Terrible things will happen,
Frankie.

1353
01:13:29,113 --> 01:13:31,149
Please listen to me now, please.

1354
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:32,278
I'm beat.

1355
01:13:32,325 --> 01:13:33,815
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

1356
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:35,779
But we're running out
of tomorrows.

1357
01:13:35,828 --> 01:13:37,347
I'm going to take a bath
and get some sleep.

1358
01:13:37,371 --> 01:13:39,362
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

1359
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:47,124
I'll phone for an appointment,
my love.

1360
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:56,429
Why does it take me years
to learn a lesson?

1361
01:13:56,474 --> 01:13:58,886
Why do I continue
to put money into actors

1362
01:13:58,935 --> 01:14:01,392
whose films simply
don't sell tickets?

1363
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:03,803
I thought the rushes were very,
very good, Kenneth.

1364
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:05,062
These are exhibitors' reports.

1365
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:06,972
They speak very clearly
and very loudly.

1366
01:14:07,026 --> 01:14:09,859
They say, "do not send any more
frank Fane product.

1367
01:14:09,904 --> 01:14:11,440
Send botulism or typhus.

1368
01:14:11,489 --> 01:14:13,070
Don't send Fane."

1369
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:15,135
Some of Frankie's pictures
have been your biggest grossers.

1370
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:16,194
Certainly.

1371
01:14:16,243 --> 01:14:17,574
Which ones?

1372
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:19,360
I'll tell you which ones.

1373
01:14:19,413 --> 01:14:22,325
This one costarring John Wayne,
this one with Jack lemmon

1374
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:25,742
and Shirley MacLaine,
this one with kirk Douglas.

1375
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:28,036
He did a great job
in "breakthrough."

1376
01:14:28,089 --> 01:14:29,954
The critics gave him raves.

1377
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:32,498
It will be the most artistic
financial flop I ever made.

1378
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:34,712
I'm not saying
Fane isn't a good actor,

1379
01:14:34,762 --> 01:14:36,878
he's just not good box office.

1380
01:14:36,931 --> 01:14:39,388
Yes, kappy, Kenneth is right.

1381
01:14:39,433 --> 01:14:43,927
It's the magic the camera
catches that makes a star.

1382
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:47,313
I thought Frankie had it
but I was wrong.

1383
01:14:47,358 --> 01:14:49,940
And I say he does have it.
I've seen it.

1384
01:14:49,986 --> 01:14:51,317
I've seen him walk into a room.

1385
01:14:51,362 --> 01:14:53,227
I've watched women react.

1386
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:54,895
It's happened before, kappy.

1387
01:14:54,949 --> 01:14:56,564
We've seen it, you and I.

1388
01:14:56,617 --> 01:14:58,073
What happens in a room

1389
01:14:58,119 --> 01:15:00,280
just doesn't come across
on the screen.

1390
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:06,996
That personal magnetism wears
off on film like hypnosis.

1391
01:15:07,044 --> 01:15:09,751
Kenneth perceived it
from the beginning.

1392
01:15:09,797 --> 01:15:12,038
I admit I was fooled.

1393
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:14,173
And his demands.

1394
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:18,302
If I had a dime for every dollar
he cost in lost production.

1395
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:21,510
The fights, arguments.

1396
01:15:21,559 --> 01:15:24,847
He's a trouble, kappy,
you know that's the truth.

1397
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:27,978
And not to make a dime
from a trouble.

1398
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:33,146
So...

1399
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:34,935
We take off
the clown's happy face

1400
01:15:34,989 --> 01:15:37,275
and see tears underneath.

1401
01:15:37,324 --> 01:15:39,030
Don't, kappy.

1402
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:42,534
You leave a man's career
like a bag of broken glass

1403
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:44,741
and you say, "don't, kappy"?

1404
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:49,826
Once a long time ago,
Sophie, you came to me,

1405
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:52,916
you asked me a favor.

1406
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:55,001
I wondered
if I was making a mistake,

1407
01:15:55,051 --> 01:16:00,045
but I did the favor
because you were who you were.

1408
01:16:00,097 --> 01:16:01,928
I'm someone else now.

1409
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:04,886
He changed me.

1410
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:07,426
No one changes anyone else.

1411
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,721
They merely open the doors.

1412
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:12,982
You have to walk through
those doors yourself.

1413
01:16:17,865 --> 01:16:20,607
You know what the sadness is,
Sophie?

1414
01:16:20,659 --> 01:16:24,493
That you couldn't possibly
do the hurt to him

1415
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:26,494
that he did to you.

1416
01:16:46,227 --> 01:16:47,933
I'm beginning to think
you're telepathic.

1417
01:16:47,978 --> 01:16:50,264
I was gonna call you,
I need some money.

1418
01:16:50,314 --> 01:16:52,930
There isn't any more money,
Frankie.

1419
01:16:52,983 --> 01:16:55,190
Working on the set all day
has apparently dulled

1420
01:16:55,236 --> 01:16:56,726
my sense of humor.

1421
01:16:56,779 --> 01:16:58,735
I don't get the joke.

1422
01:16:58,781 --> 01:17:00,692
You have back taxes to pay,

1423
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:03,027
not to mention
commissions owing me.

1424
01:17:03,077 --> 01:17:04,908
The money you keep overdrawing
for the boat,

1425
01:17:04,954 --> 01:17:07,616
household expenses,
it's no joke, Frankie.

1426
01:17:07,665 --> 01:17:11,157
I'm not in a joking mood.

1427
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:14,168
Regan isn't picking up
your option.

1428
01:17:14,213 --> 01:17:17,751
Figures from the exhibitors,
trouble with your pictures.

1429
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,040
Eh, who cares?

1430
01:17:19,093 --> 01:17:20,629
I don't need Regan.

1431
01:17:24,181 --> 01:17:27,139
What about that spy thing
at warners?

1432
01:17:27,184 --> 01:17:29,140
They signed Dean Martin.

1433
01:17:29,186 --> 01:17:30,471
Dean Martin?

1434
01:17:30,521 --> 01:17:31,931
That part was right for me.

1435
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:33,846
Yeah, but they wanted
Dean Martin.

1436
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:35,560
Look, I'm not trying
to hurt you,

1437
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:40,524
I'm just trying to clear away
the fog between you and reality.

1438
01:17:40,573 --> 01:17:42,234
There's
a short-scheduled picture

1439
01:17:42,283 --> 01:17:45,320
that I've been working on
for you.

1440
01:17:45,369 --> 01:17:48,861
It means a trick deal,
a cut in salary.

1441
01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:51,371
It's a nice script,
one of those horror shticks

1442
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:54,454
with a couple of big name
older actresses.

1443
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:56,915
Kappy, you've gotta be
shuckin' me.

1444
01:17:56,964 --> 01:18:00,798
Cut in salary?
Trick deal? Old bags?

1445
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:04,919
Here's your money, Frankie,

1446
01:18:04,972 --> 01:18:08,055
and I think
it's for the last time.

1447
01:18:11,395 --> 01:18:13,056
Face facts.

1448
01:18:13,105 --> 01:18:15,187
In a few days,
the word goes out,

1449
01:18:15,232 --> 01:18:17,689
it always does.

1450
01:18:17,735 --> 01:18:19,851
You're runnin' scared.

1451
01:18:19,904 --> 01:18:21,610
A little trouble
and it's chicken licken,

1452
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:23,270
the sky is falling.

1453
01:18:23,324 --> 01:18:25,360
If that's the kind of faith
in me ten percent buys,

1454
01:18:25,409 --> 01:18:27,320
maybe I need a fresh agent.

1455
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:29,405
I'll pretend that wasn't said.

1456
01:18:35,002 --> 01:18:36,617
But Frankie
couldn't face reality

1457
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:38,956
because he had
lost touch with it.

1458
01:18:39,006 --> 01:18:41,668
And kappy, he was busy
trying to save the pieces

1459
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:43,628
of Frankie's career.

1460
01:18:43,677 --> 01:18:47,590
But the word was out,
he was box office poison.

1461
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:50,507
It was like trying
to save humpty dumpty.

1462
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:53,722
All the king's horses and all
the king's men couldn't do it.

1463
01:18:53,771 --> 01:18:55,386
Neither could kappy.

1464
01:18:59,276 --> 01:19:01,813
Did you have a good day?

1465
01:19:01,862 --> 01:19:04,148
Tell it like it is.

1466
01:19:04,198 --> 01:19:08,567
Well, they talk James garner
or rod Taylor or somebody else.

1467
01:19:08,619 --> 01:19:10,200
They won't talk you.

1468
01:19:10,246 --> 01:19:12,737
When you tell it straight,
you don't do any polka, do you?

1469
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:14,655
Put Regan's back against
the wall, you told me,

1470
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:16,699
and I told you he'd remember.

1471
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:18,617
The figures on your picture
are all over town.

1472
01:19:18,671 --> 01:19:20,002
That crumb.

1473
01:19:20,047 --> 01:19:22,003
I broke my back for him
in "breakthrough."

1474
01:19:22,049 --> 01:19:23,164
It was a great picture.

1475
01:19:23,217 --> 01:19:24,673
I checked it out, it's all true.

1476
01:19:24,718 --> 01:19:26,424
It's like tryin'
to hatch an ostrich egg.

1477
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:28,051
The picture sits there.

1478
01:19:28,097 --> 01:19:30,075
Things can't be as bad
as you're makin' 'em, kappy.

1479
01:19:30,099 --> 01:19:31,930
Not so fast, not just like that.

1480
01:19:31,976 --> 01:19:36,310
It's as bad as you can make it,
Frankie.

1481
01:19:36,355 --> 01:19:39,813
I've got a home, a wife,
a yacht, cars.

1482
01:19:39,858 --> 01:19:42,895
I've got things I worked
a long time to get.

1483
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:45,402
It's a nightmare, kappy.

1484
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:47,984
You've gotta do something,
you've got to pull me out.

1485
01:19:48,033 --> 01:19:52,072
If you only saved a little,
Frankie, but you always spent.

1486
01:19:52,121 --> 01:19:53,702
God, how you spent.

1487
01:19:53,747 --> 01:19:55,658
That's all past. This is now.

1488
01:19:55,708 --> 01:19:57,915
Don't lecture me,
you've got to save me, kappy.

1489
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:00,121
What am I, the second coming
of the Messiah?

1490
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:03,583
I'm an agent,
there's just so much I can do.

1491
01:20:07,428 --> 01:20:10,261
All right, there's
a television pilot deal,

1492
01:20:10,306 --> 01:20:11,796
an adventure series.

1493
01:20:11,849 --> 01:20:13,760
A television pilot?

1494
01:20:15,978 --> 01:20:17,809
I figured you'd feel
that way about it.

1495
01:20:17,855 --> 01:20:19,470
Pilot films
are a dollar a six-pack.

1496
01:20:19,523 --> 01:20:21,514
If it doesn't sell,
I'm really through.

1497
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:22,977
This town is full of ex-actors

1498
01:20:23,027 --> 01:20:25,234
who were in unsold
television pilots.

1499
01:20:25,279 --> 01:20:27,520
They're selling used cars
or real estate.

1500
01:20:27,573 --> 01:20:30,360
I know, or working
as head waiters.

1501
01:20:36,415 --> 01:20:38,326
- Forget it.
- Frankie.

1502
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:39,740
Winter is coming.

1503
01:20:39,793 --> 01:20:41,203
Be smart.

1504
01:20:41,253 --> 01:20:43,084
Get in out of the cold.

1505
01:20:51,138 --> 01:20:52,503
I thought you were sleeping.

1506
01:20:52,556 --> 01:20:54,092
Why bother?

1507
01:20:54,141 --> 01:20:55,722
I don't need
the night for sleep.

1508
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:58,054
I've got all kinds
of time on my hands.

1509
01:20:58,103 --> 01:21:00,810
Morning time,
night time, noon time.

1510
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:04,144
I'm alone, just me and Sam,
my shadow.

1511
01:21:04,193 --> 01:21:06,980
Please, Kay, not tonight.

1512
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:08,829
You wouldn't believe
the kind of day I've had.

1513
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:12,197
Oh, you should put
that speech on tape.

1514
01:21:12,242 --> 01:21:14,528
It's gotten to be
a fireproof, gold-plated,

1515
01:21:14,578 --> 01:21:19,038
diamond-encrusted excuse
for never talking to me.

1516
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:20,914
And we're gonna fight again.

1517
01:21:20,959 --> 01:21:23,746
Machiavelli would have
loved your technique.

1518
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:25,627
In no time at all
I've been typecast

1519
01:21:25,672 --> 01:21:27,879
as the nagging,
shrewish haus frau.

1520
01:21:27,925 --> 01:21:31,793
Kay, you're getting more, more
I don't know what every day.

1521
01:21:31,845 --> 01:21:34,461
If you're groping for a verb
to explain my condition,

1522
01:21:34,515 --> 01:21:36,722
try "frustrated," huh?

1523
01:21:46,485 --> 01:21:49,192
What is happening
to us, Frankie?

1524
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:51,149
Nothing's happening to us.

1525
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:54,986
It's just that things
are going badly.

1526
01:21:56,787 --> 01:21:58,948
I talked to kappy today.

1527
01:21:58,997 --> 01:22:01,204
The bottom is dropping out
of everything.

1528
01:22:12,886 --> 01:22:13,921
Don't.

1529
01:22:19,685 --> 01:22:21,413
You know how to strip
the slaughtered animal clean,

1530
01:22:21,437 --> 01:22:22,847
don't you?

1531
01:22:22,896 --> 01:22:24,602
Well, there isn't much left
when you say,

1532
01:22:24,648 --> 01:22:27,731
"no, thank you,
maybe some other time

1533
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:29,391
when I can stomach you!"

1534
01:22:42,166 --> 01:22:43,702
Speaking for the network,
gentlemen,

1535
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:46,207
we think
it's a beautiful package.

1536
01:22:46,253 --> 01:22:48,369
I think this meeting today
will go a long way

1537
01:22:48,422 --> 01:22:50,208
towards reassuring Mr. Quentin

1538
01:22:50,257 --> 01:22:51,997
that frank Fane is just right

1539
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:53,460
for the pilot script.

1540
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:54,625
I'm a businessman.

1541
01:22:54,678 --> 01:22:56,134
I deal in tile, paint,

1542
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:58,842
and things that become
part of your home,

1543
01:22:58,891 --> 01:23:01,678
so that anybody stands up there
on that television screen says,

1544
01:23:01,727 --> 01:23:04,013
"I used quentiplak
in my rumpus room,

1545
01:23:04,062 --> 01:23:06,303
that man has to stand
for something."

1546
01:23:06,356 --> 01:23:08,392
Excuse me, gentlemen,
what has this got to do

1547
01:23:08,442 --> 01:23:10,057
with Mr. Fane as an actor?

1548
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:11,600
Mr. Fane, as star of the series,

1549
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:13,860
is required to do
Quentin tile commercials.

1550
01:23:13,906 --> 01:23:16,818
Part of the contract,
clause six.

1551
01:23:16,867 --> 01:23:18,823
Yeah, of course.

1552
01:23:18,869 --> 01:23:21,155
That man has to stand
for Quentin products.

1553
01:23:21,205 --> 01:23:22,445
He has to be acceptable

1554
01:23:22,498 --> 01:23:24,454
to two and a half
million American people

1555
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:28,209
who will be saying, "come in,
be a guest in my house."

1556
01:23:28,253 --> 01:23:30,335
Well, I think frank Fane
would be a welcome guest

1557
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:31,495
in any house.

1558
01:23:31,548 --> 01:23:33,379
Well, now I'm not much
of a movie-goer,

1559
01:23:33,425 --> 01:23:34,915
but Mrs. Quentin, my wife,

1560
01:23:34,968 --> 01:23:36,924
she's very big
on that sort of thing,

1561
01:23:36,970 --> 01:23:38,426
you know, theater.

1562
01:23:38,472 --> 01:23:40,133
And she has very good taste.

1563
01:23:40,182 --> 01:23:41,547
You see, gentlemen, Mrs. Quentin

1564
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:46,060
has a very highly defined sense
of what is saleable over TV.

1565
01:23:46,104 --> 01:23:47,844
It was her idea
to market quentiplak

1566
01:23:47,898 --> 01:23:50,640
- in pastel colors, you recall.
- I asked her, I said,

1567
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:52,353
"Phyllis, would you want
this Fane fellow

1568
01:23:52,402 --> 01:23:54,814
in our home
for a Saturday night party?"

1569
01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:56,353
"It'd be a pleasure,” she said.

1570
01:23:56,406 --> 01:23:58,021
And I agree.

1571
01:23:58,075 --> 01:23:59,940
Now, Mr. Fane
looks clean-cut to me.

1572
01:23:59,993 --> 01:24:01,699
He isn't one of those
snotty little punks

1573
01:24:01,745 --> 01:24:04,361
with too much hair that
they have on those other shows.

1574
01:24:04,414 --> 01:24:06,996
We need a man of this sort
for promotion,

1575
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:09,203
a man that men
will look at and say,

1576
01:24:09,253 --> 01:24:12,211
"he's a man,”
that's a necessity.

1577
01:24:12,256 --> 01:24:14,212
A Mr. Kelly for Mr. Fane.

1578
01:24:14,258 --> 01:24:16,214
Tell him to leave a number,
we're in conference.

1579
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:19,002
He says it's urgent,
extremely urgent.

1580
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:21,045
I'll take it
in the outer office.

1581
01:24:21,098 --> 01:24:23,339
You go ahead, I'll catch up.

1582
01:24:23,392 --> 01:24:26,054
I don't think we need to worry
about Fane being a man.

1583
01:24:26,103 --> 01:24:27,889
He looks like a real man.

1584
01:24:27,938 --> 01:24:30,805
Hell, he's a man all right.

1585
01:24:32,568 --> 01:24:34,900
You can take it
right over there, Mr. Fane.

1586
01:24:37,447 --> 01:24:38,937
- Hymie?
- You've just been nominated

1587
01:24:38,991 --> 01:24:40,606
- for an Oscar.
- What?

1588
01:24:40,659 --> 01:24:42,945
- I can't hear you.
- I'm at the academy,

1589
01:24:42,995 --> 01:24:45,281
and they just released
the Oscar nominations.

1590
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:47,036
Frankie, do you hear me?

1591
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:49,619
I said they just nominated you
for the best actor,

1592
01:24:49,668 --> 01:24:53,661
"breakthrough," you
and Burton and Lancaster and...

1593
01:24:53,714 --> 01:24:55,750
Hymie, if this is a gag
I'll kill ya.

1594
01:24:55,799 --> 01:24:58,506
Hey, Frankie, congratulations!

1595
01:24:58,552 --> 01:25:00,964
So help me, Frankie,
it's no gag.

1596
01:25:01,013 --> 01:25:03,550
It's the emmes, the truth,
you've been nominated.

1597
01:25:03,599 --> 01:25:06,257
Frankie!

1598
01:25:06,310 --> 01:25:07,345
Talk to you later.

1599
01:25:10,063 --> 01:25:11,974
Frankie, they're getting
impatient.

1600
01:25:13,817 --> 01:25:15,523
I don't think I can make it.

1601
01:25:17,237 --> 01:25:18,943
What are you talking about?

1602
01:25:18,989 --> 01:25:21,196
I'm not doing
that nitwit series.

1603
01:25:21,241 --> 01:25:23,903
Wait a minute, Frankie, this
is one of the major networks.

1604
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:25,430
They've already put money
into the project,

1605
01:25:25,454 --> 01:25:27,054
they've brought out
an important sponsor.

1606
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:28,445
That's their problem.

1607
01:25:28,498 --> 01:25:29,908
No one told them to go ahead.

1608
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:31,368
I told 'em to go ahead.

1609
01:25:31,418 --> 01:25:33,750
Then it's your problem.
I never authorized it.

1610
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:35,607
You didn't sit there
in the Polo lounge and say,

1611
01:25:35,631 --> 01:25:38,247
"go ahead, kappy.
Save my life, kappy.

1612
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:41,588
Let me keep my car,
my home, my yacht."

1613
01:25:41,637 --> 01:25:43,719
You didn't do this?

1614
01:25:43,764 --> 01:25:46,722
One phone call
and I'm not dogmeat

1615
01:25:46,767 --> 01:25:48,052
like I was in Regan's office,

1616
01:25:48,101 --> 01:25:49,637
like I was in there
a minute ago.

1617
01:25:49,686 --> 01:25:51,847
One phone call.

1618
01:25:51,897 --> 01:25:53,853
So just go sliding back
in there and tell 'em,

1619
01:25:53,899 --> 01:25:56,606
"game called
on account of Oscar."

1620
01:25:56,652 --> 01:25:58,938
That's right, Oscar.

1621
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:01,569
That phone call from hymie.

1622
01:26:01,615 --> 01:26:04,402
Academy nominations
were announced.

1623
01:26:04,451 --> 01:26:07,864
I was nominated
for "breakthrough."

1624
01:26:07,913 --> 01:26:11,201
So go tell old quentiplak
and his wife Phyllis

1625
01:26:11,249 --> 01:26:14,241
I won't be able to come to their
house party Saturday night.

1626
01:26:19,383 --> 01:26:20,543
Congratulations, boss.

1627
01:26:20,592 --> 01:26:22,457
Yeah, sure, baby, thanks, bye.

1628
01:26:22,511 --> 01:26:24,030
Where have you been?
They told me you left

1629
01:26:24,054 --> 01:26:25,794
the network three hours ago.

1630
01:26:25,847 --> 01:26:27,383
I took a drive.

1631
01:26:27,432 --> 01:26:29,013
Well, the phones
haven't stopped.

1632
01:26:29,059 --> 01:26:30,703
While you were out playing
the wandering gentile,

1633
01:26:30,727 --> 01:26:32,372
everyone who wouldn't
look our way last week

1634
01:26:32,396 --> 01:26:34,352
is calling
to proclaim buddyhood.

1635
01:26:34,398 --> 01:26:36,764
It's a hell of a thing, hymie.

1636
01:26:36,817 --> 01:26:38,728
Yeah, it is a hell
of a thing, all right.

1637
01:26:40,779 --> 01:26:42,940
I've been driving around
thinking.

1638
01:26:42,989 --> 01:26:44,945
All the way back to the smokers.

1639
01:26:46,243 --> 01:26:47,512
You won't believe
what it was like

1640
01:26:47,536 --> 01:26:49,197
in that office this morning.

1641
01:26:49,246 --> 01:26:51,077
I was nothing all over again.

1642
01:26:51,123 --> 01:26:52,488
Fane residence.

1643
01:26:52,541 --> 01:26:53,951
I was sitting
on my hands sweating

1644
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,831
while they had me
on the counter.

1645
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:03,499
170 pounds of meat again,
sold to the highest bidder.

1646
01:27:06,513 --> 01:27:08,344
- Hi.
- Frankie!

1647
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:09,926
Congratulations, Frankie.

1648
01:27:09,975 --> 01:27:11,681
Everyone here
is so excited for you,

1649
01:27:11,727 --> 01:27:13,263
you just don't know.

1650
01:27:13,311 --> 01:27:14,767
It was wonderful news.

1651
01:27:14,813 --> 01:27:16,474
Edith says
you simply have to win

1652
01:27:16,523 --> 01:27:19,230
because everybody at the studio
here is rooting for you.

1653
01:27:19,276 --> 01:27:21,267
Thanks, Kay,
and thank Edith for me.

1654
01:27:21,319 --> 01:27:23,059
Aren't you thrilled?

1655
01:27:23,113 --> 01:27:24,853
Haven't come in
for a landing yet.

1656
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:27,522
Save some champagne for me, eh?

1657
01:27:27,576 --> 01:27:29,407
- Right.
- Okay, darling.

1658
01:27:29,453 --> 01:27:31,284
See you later. Bye.

1659
01:27:32,914 --> 01:27:34,199
We've got a lot of work ahead.

1660
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:37,537
The other nominees have probably
started their campaigns already.

1661
01:27:37,586 --> 01:27:39,577
We'll lead off with ads
in the trade papers,

1662
01:27:39,629 --> 01:27:43,087
- thanking the...
- Oh, later, hymie, I'm beat.

1663
01:27:43,133 --> 01:27:46,296
Like somebody pulled the plug
and let the juice out of me.

1664
01:27:50,766 --> 01:27:52,722
This morning I saw
what the bottom of the bucket

1665
01:27:52,768 --> 01:27:53,974
looks like again.

1666
01:27:56,188 --> 01:27:57,928
And now an Oscar nomination.

1667
01:28:08,992 --> 01:28:10,698
This is a chancy business,
Frankie.

1668
01:28:10,744 --> 01:28:12,405
It can happen.

1669
01:28:12,454 --> 01:28:14,069
You never know
you're on the way out

1670
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:16,204
till you suddenly realize
it would take a ticket

1671
01:28:16,249 --> 01:28:18,365
- to get back in.
- It can happen so fast

1672
01:28:18,418 --> 01:28:20,204
it's like being stunned
by a hammer.

1673
01:28:20,253 --> 01:28:22,084
You heard me, freeloader.

1674
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:24,587
Don't let the door
hit you in the backside.

1675
01:28:24,633 --> 01:28:26,715
That Fane guy's nothing.

1676
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:29,627
You bring me meat, filet Fane.

1677
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:30,714
Meat.

1678
01:28:30,764 --> 01:28:32,925
It's fear, Frankie.

1679
01:28:32,974 --> 01:28:35,431
Is this going to help you
bury your fear?

1680
01:28:35,477 --> 01:28:36,683
- Meat.
- It's fear.

1681
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:37,914
- Freeloader!
- I don't need any

1682
01:28:37,938 --> 01:28:38,973
second-rate spieler!

1683
01:28:39,022 --> 01:28:40,353
That Fane guy's nothing.

1684
01:28:40,398 --> 01:28:42,013
- It's fear.
- It can happen.

1685
01:28:42,067 --> 01:28:43,273
- Meat.
- Freeloader!

1686
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:44,728
- Second-rate spieler!
- Nothing!

1687
01:28:44,778 --> 01:28:46,063
It can happen, it can happen,

1688
01:28:46,112 --> 01:28:48,148
it can happen fast.

1689
01:28:48,198 --> 01:28:51,986
Fear, fear, fear, fear,
fear, fear, fear, fear.

1690
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:08,332
When it hits,
I want it to hit big.

1691
01:29:08,385 --> 01:29:09,420
You think you can do it?

1692
01:29:09,469 --> 01:29:11,425
Sure I can.

1693
01:29:11,471 --> 01:29:14,087
I can get it on the front page
of every major newspaper

1694
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:16,256
in the country within 48 hours.

1695
01:29:17,561 --> 01:29:20,223
What happens when
they ask who hired you?

1696
01:29:20,272 --> 01:29:21,853
Now you know better than that.

1697
01:29:21,898 --> 01:29:23,388
It's built in the deal.

1698
01:29:23,441 --> 01:29:24,851
I'm a private detective.

1699
01:29:24,901 --> 01:29:26,892
It's privileged communication.

1700
01:29:26,945 --> 01:29:30,779
But if I reveal
just the name of one client,

1701
01:29:30,824 --> 01:29:32,485
I'm out of business.

1702
01:29:33,994 --> 01:29:36,406
There's $2,000 in it for you.

1703
01:29:36,454 --> 01:29:39,366
A thousand now and a thousand
after I do it, okay?

1704
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:43,124
It's all there, $2,000.

1705
01:29:43,169 --> 01:29:45,455
Now we don't have
to see each other again.

1706
01:29:47,841 --> 01:29:49,331
Okay.

1707
01:29:51,636 --> 01:29:56,096
Now, you want it leaked
just this way:

1708
01:29:56,141 --> 01:29:58,223
That you were arrested
for prostitution and procuring

1709
01:29:58,268 --> 01:30:01,180
and jumped bail,
you and this fella,

1710
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:05,097
hymie Kelly, and a girl by
the name of Laurel Scott, right?

1711
01:30:06,943 --> 01:30:10,811
Hey, Mr. Fane,
you're a pretty chilly item.

1712
01:30:10,864 --> 01:30:13,230
I can't figure you out.

1713
01:30:13,283 --> 01:30:15,069
Yeah.

1714
01:30:15,118 --> 01:30:16,403
How about that?

1715
01:30:21,458 --> 01:30:23,870
Early papers.
Everything hit the fan.

1716
01:30:23,919 --> 01:30:25,771
Some crud dug up what happened
to us in Clinton,

1717
01:30:25,795 --> 01:30:27,786
how we got put in jail
on morals charges.

1718
01:30:27,839 --> 01:30:30,330
- Ooh-wee! That ain't good.
- Don't bother to read.

1719
01:30:30,383 --> 01:30:32,612
They've got all of the facts,
right down to the bail jump

1720
01:30:32,636 --> 01:30:34,672
and the spelling
of the sheriff's name.

1721
01:30:34,721 --> 01:30:36,257
Give me a gallon of coffee, Sam.

1722
01:30:36,306 --> 01:30:37,842
What's the talk around town?

1723
01:30:37,891 --> 01:30:39,660
That you're an ex-pimp
and I'm a child molester.

1724
01:30:39,684 --> 01:30:42,642
I've heard of dirty politics
but this is the lowest.

1725
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:44,447
Putting myself aside
for the moment, Frankie,

1726
01:30:44,481 --> 01:30:46,563
it's an even lousier break
for you.

1727
01:30:46,608 --> 01:30:48,502
They're saying that too?
That it's a tough break?

1728
01:30:48,526 --> 01:30:50,126
Well, sure,
almost everybody in this town

1729
01:30:50,153 --> 01:30:51,422
lives with the big worry
of scandal,

1730
01:30:51,446 --> 01:30:52,936
so when something
like this hits,

1731
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:58,908
hey!

1732
01:30:58,954 --> 01:31:00,444
You know somethin'?

1733
01:31:00,497 --> 01:31:02,297
This doesn't seem to grab you
like I expected.

1734
01:31:02,332 --> 01:31:03,572
You don't seem to realize

1735
01:31:03,625 --> 01:31:05,490
we're hand-in-hand
into the sewer together!

1736
01:31:05,543 --> 01:31:06,578
Frankie!

1737
01:31:10,256 --> 01:31:12,838
Now keep your mouth shut,
and listen.

1738
01:31:12,884 --> 01:31:15,045
Nobody knows who broke this.

1739
01:31:15,095 --> 01:31:17,461
But who has reason to shaft me?

1740
01:31:17,514 --> 01:31:20,051
One of the other
four nominees, right?

1741
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:22,182
But which one?

1742
01:31:22,227 --> 01:31:25,344
So in sympathy,
the academy votes for me.

1743
01:31:26,606 --> 01:31:28,892
Pull one plug and I drown
all the opposition.

1744
01:31:28,942 --> 01:31:30,648
Sweeps the boards against me.

1745
01:31:32,988 --> 01:31:35,400
I blew the whistle on myself.

1746
01:31:35,448 --> 01:31:38,315
You must be suffering
from oxygen starvation!

1747
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:40,700
I'm fighting for my life!

1748
01:31:40,745 --> 01:31:43,828
And I'll use a spiked boot
on anybody who gets in my way.

1749
01:31:45,208 --> 01:31:47,540
Oh, hymie, I was goin'
down for the third time

1750
01:31:47,585 --> 01:31:48,825
when I got that nomination.

1751
01:31:48,878 --> 01:31:50,789
But you got a nomination!

1752
01:31:50,839 --> 01:31:52,545
I osers are a dime a dozen.

1753
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:54,251
Who were the nominees last year?

1754
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:55,631
Or the year before?

1755
01:31:55,677 --> 01:31:57,918
Can't remember, right?

1756
01:31:57,971 --> 01:32:00,428
Only get remembered
when you win.

1757
01:32:00,473 --> 01:32:02,338
And I'm gonna win.

1758
01:32:04,310 --> 01:32:07,393
I need that Oscar, hymie,
more than anybody.

1759
01:32:07,439 --> 01:32:09,083
That Oscar can give me
the kind of pictures

1760
01:32:09,107 --> 01:32:11,894
that can keep me from drowning.

1761
01:32:11,943 --> 01:32:14,150
I can't rig the votes,

1762
01:32:14,195 --> 01:32:17,528
but I can rig the emotions
of the voters.

1763
01:32:17,574 --> 01:32:21,533
I'm not exactly guy kibbee,
world's most beloved actor,

1764
01:32:21,578 --> 01:32:23,097
so I had to find another way
to reach them.

1765
01:32:23,121 --> 01:32:25,954
But if it goes wrong
it could be suicide.

1766
01:32:25,999 --> 01:32:29,583
Not just the Oscar, but the
whole town, completely snap!

1767
01:32:29,627 --> 01:32:31,618
I'm on the edge right now.

1768
01:32:31,671 --> 01:32:33,832
You think I like admitting
this is where it ends?

1769
01:32:33,882 --> 01:32:36,999
You think I like putting
my head on a block like this?

1770
01:32:37,052 --> 01:32:39,543
You don't care
who else it smears, do you?

1771
01:32:39,596 --> 01:32:41,757
Can't make an omelet
without breakin' eggs.

1772
01:32:41,806 --> 01:32:43,012
Ya lie down with pigs,

1773
01:32:43,058 --> 01:32:45,094
ya come up
smellin' like garbage!

1774
01:32:45,143 --> 01:32:47,350
So now it's my turn,
huh, Frankie?

1775
01:32:47,395 --> 01:32:50,307
One after another
you finally get to all of us.

1776
01:32:58,073 --> 01:33:00,940
That's a custom made cashmere,

1777
01:33:00,992 --> 01:33:03,324
a lot better than
the scuffed-around threads

1778
01:33:03,369 --> 01:33:05,530
you wore in the village.

1779
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:07,866
Or have you forgotten
New York already?

1780
01:33:07,916 --> 01:33:09,560
You've got me on the hook,
haven't you, Frankie?

1781
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:11,666
It's your hook!

1782
01:33:11,711 --> 01:33:13,702
Jump free whenever you want!

1783
01:33:19,552 --> 01:33:20,837
Now, call a press conference.

1784
01:33:20,887 --> 01:33:22,377
Wha...

1785
01:33:22,430 --> 01:33:26,048
How else will I get a big play
when I confess?

1786
01:33:26,101 --> 01:33:28,763
Set it up in the private
dining room at chasen's.

1787
01:33:33,608 --> 01:33:35,269
You start balkin',

1788
01:33:35,318 --> 01:33:38,310
I start cuttin' the hired help.

1789
01:33:38,363 --> 01:33:40,479
And you ain't got a union, baby.

1790
01:33:40,532 --> 01:33:43,615
No, but I've got a patron Saint.

1791
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:44,991
Saint Judas.

1792
01:33:54,087 --> 01:33:56,328
I just heard about it
at the studio.

1793
01:33:56,381 --> 01:33:59,544
I'm sorry, truly sorry.

1794
01:33:59,592 --> 01:34:01,958
It was a terrible thing
to do to you.

1795
01:34:10,937 --> 01:34:11,972
Here he comes!

1796
01:34:14,607 --> 01:34:16,814
Frankie, you gonna sue
for libel, and for how much?

1797
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:18,350
My paper checked Clinton records

1798
01:34:18,403 --> 01:34:20,189
and they do have you
on the books down there

1799
01:34:20,238 --> 01:34:22,445
for prostitution
and for procuring.

1800
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:23,884
Yeah, how are you going
to explain that, Frankie?

1801
01:34:23,908 --> 01:34:25,193
That's not easy to explain.

1802
01:34:26,452 --> 01:34:27,783
Quiet, boys, quiet!

1803
01:34:27,829 --> 01:34:29,535
Hold it down, please!

1804
01:34:29,581 --> 01:34:31,788
I explain it by telling you
to go three days

1805
01:34:31,833 --> 01:34:33,619
without anything to eat.

1806
01:34:33,668 --> 01:34:35,271
By workin' the road
for a handful of bucks

1807
01:34:35,295 --> 01:34:37,627
so you can get a bunk
for the night.

1808
01:34:37,672 --> 01:34:39,833
Sure we were arrested.

1809
01:34:39,883 --> 01:34:42,124
We were short-changed
by a crook,

1810
01:34:42,177 --> 01:34:43,542
and when we put up a beef,

1811
01:34:43,595 --> 01:34:44,960
we were booked on those charges,

1812
01:34:45,013 --> 01:34:47,049
but we were just trying
to make a decent living.

1813
01:34:47,098 --> 01:34:49,635
In smokers with a stripper?

1814
01:34:49,684 --> 01:34:51,345
Yeah, tiger.

1815
01:34:51,394 --> 01:34:53,726
With a stripper, in smokers.

1816
01:34:53,771 --> 01:34:56,228
Because that was all we knew
how to do.

1817
01:34:56,274 --> 01:34:59,186
We were flat broke,
we didn't have any skills,

1818
01:34:59,235 --> 01:35:01,351
so we made out
the best way we could.

1819
01:35:01,404 --> 01:35:05,363
And we're about as guilty
of those charges as you are.

1820
01:35:05,408 --> 01:35:07,219
And nobody's going to be asking
the girl, Laurel Scott,

1821
01:35:07,243 --> 01:35:09,609
about it because she isn't here
to defend herself.

1822
01:35:09,662 --> 01:35:11,368
She's dead.

1823
01:35:11,414 --> 01:35:14,030
Frankie, there's talk around
town this was a smear tactic

1824
01:35:14,083 --> 01:35:15,448
by one of the other
Oscar nominees

1825
01:35:15,501 --> 01:35:17,287
to put you out of the running.

1826
01:35:17,337 --> 01:35:19,373
I flatly reject the idea.

1827
01:35:19,422 --> 01:35:21,066
These are four
of the most highly respected

1828
01:35:21,090 --> 01:35:22,876
members of our community.

1829
01:35:22,926 --> 01:35:25,008
I can't believe one of them
would do such a thing.

1830
01:35:25,053 --> 01:35:26,293
Then who's behind it?

1831
01:35:26,346 --> 01:35:28,462
I don't know,
probably some crank,

1832
01:35:28,514 --> 01:35:30,220
some very sick person.

1833
01:35:30,266 --> 01:35:32,427
Do you think this will hurt
your chances for the Oscar?

1834
01:35:32,477 --> 01:35:34,889
Only the voters can answer that.

1835
01:35:34,938 --> 01:35:38,681
I can only tell you what is
a lie and what is the truth.

1836
01:35:38,733 --> 01:35:42,772
I've always tried
to level with you before,

1837
01:35:42,820 --> 01:35:45,482
and I'm leveling with you now.

1838
01:35:45,531 --> 01:35:46,691
I hope you believe me.

1839
01:35:47,992 --> 01:35:49,261
Frankie should
have won the Oscar

1840
01:35:49,285 --> 01:35:51,446
right then and there
for the performance he gave.

1841
01:35:51,496 --> 01:35:53,703
He set his scene
and sold his case.

1842
01:35:53,748 --> 01:35:56,205
He wrapped up the package
of being the maligned underdog

1843
01:35:56,251 --> 01:35:58,913
and every newspaper man
left there believing it.

1844
01:35:58,962 --> 01:36:00,918
Didn't matter to Frankie
that he had dug a girl

1845
01:36:00,964 --> 01:36:03,421
out of her grave
to sell his point.

1846
01:36:03,466 --> 01:36:06,549
Frankie used them whether
they were living or dead.

1847
01:36:08,137 --> 01:36:09,502
Frankie had stacked the deck,

1848
01:36:09,555 --> 01:36:11,671
and was ready for the hand
to be played.

1849
01:36:11,724 --> 01:36:14,511
And the game at Regan's party
was showdown.

1850
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:16,300
It was Frankie's
first public outing

1851
01:36:16,354 --> 01:36:18,015
since the press conference.

1852
01:36:21,609 --> 01:36:25,022
He was facing a black-tie jury
of his peers.

1853
01:36:25,071 --> 01:36:28,404
The scene to be played:
Humble but proud.

1854
01:36:28,449 --> 01:36:30,360
Color it Sincere.

1855
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:31,445
Lights.

1856
01:36:31,494 --> 01:36:32,529
Camera.

1857
01:36:32,578 --> 01:36:33,784
Action.

1858
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:36,993
Frankie, congratulations
on your nomination!

1859
01:36:37,041 --> 01:36:38,156
Congratulations!

1860
01:36:38,209 --> 01:36:39,494
Good to see you!

1861
01:36:47,593 --> 01:36:49,675
Kay, how nice of you to come.

1862
01:36:49,721 --> 01:36:51,161
Edith is right over there
at the bar.

1863
01:36:52,473 --> 01:36:54,304
I will. Thank you very much.

1864
01:36:56,811 --> 01:36:57,971
Hi, Edith!

1865
01:36:58,021 --> 01:37:00,353
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1866
01:37:00,398 --> 01:37:02,605
I want to thank you
for this party, Kenneth.

1867
01:37:02,650 --> 01:37:04,515
It isn't really necessary
for me to listen

1868
01:37:04,569 --> 01:37:07,527
to this slice of humility,
is it, Frankie?

1869
01:37:07,572 --> 01:37:11,656
You don't think my attitude
toward you has changed, do you?

1870
01:37:11,701 --> 01:37:14,158
I still consider you
one of the most despicable men

1871
01:37:14,203 --> 01:37:16,098
- I ever encountered.
- Then why go to so much trouble

1872
01:37:16,122 --> 01:37:17,703
for a bitter enemy?

1873
01:37:17,749 --> 01:37:20,991
I'm not at all certain I can put
it in terms you'd grasp.

1874
01:37:21,044 --> 01:37:23,626
Then tell it
like a giant golden book.

1875
01:37:23,671 --> 01:37:25,536
I think I can cut it.

1876
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:28,753
Well, it has to do
with pride in craft, Frankie.

1877
01:37:28,801 --> 01:37:31,258
With identification
and the industry.

1878
01:37:31,304 --> 01:37:33,295
I didn't know this
was a testimonial dinner.

1879
01:37:33,348 --> 01:37:35,088
Easy enough to be flippant,

1880
01:37:35,141 --> 01:37:36,785
but I've been in
the motion picture business

1881
01:37:36,809 --> 01:37:38,470
for 37 years,

1882
01:37:38,519 --> 01:37:41,807
and this smear
that's being aimed at you,

1883
01:37:41,856 --> 01:37:45,314
it's throwing mud
on the academy awards as well.

1884
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:48,067
And despite your sneers, Fane,

1885
01:37:48,112 --> 01:37:49,693
the oscars mean
a great deal to me,

1886
01:37:52,116 --> 01:37:56,359
they're a symbol, we don't like
to see them tarnished.

1887
01:37:56,412 --> 01:38:00,075
I find myself
repelled and repulsed by you,

1888
01:38:00,124 --> 01:38:01,955
but you're getting
a severely raw deal,

1889
01:38:02,001 --> 01:38:06,370
and this party is meant to say
we won't stand for it.

1890
01:38:06,422 --> 01:38:11,041
I think my line is,
"thanks for nothing."

1891
01:38:11,094 --> 01:38:13,551
I'm sure you think
that's your line.

1892
01:38:21,979 --> 01:38:25,642
Frankie, I've seen men back away
from things this nasty.

1893
01:38:25,691 --> 01:38:27,461
It takes guts to stand up to it
the way you're doing.

1894
01:38:27,485 --> 01:38:28,895
- Thank you.
- My name is pereira,

1895
01:38:28,945 --> 01:38:30,464
I'm in art direction.
Just wanted to say hello.

1896
01:38:30,488 --> 01:38:31,728
Thank you very much, sir.

1897
01:38:41,290 --> 01:38:42,780
Welcome home. Nice party?

1898
01:38:42,834 --> 01:38:44,495
Oh, a very nice party, Sam.

1899
01:38:44,544 --> 01:38:45,579
Thank you.

1900
01:38:45,628 --> 01:38:46,788
What are you doing up?

1901
01:38:46,838 --> 01:38:48,107
I'm playing gin rummy
with hymie.

1902
01:38:48,131 --> 01:38:49,291
Knock with five points.

1903
01:38:49,340 --> 01:38:50,546
You lose.

1904
01:38:50,591 --> 01:38:51,876
Advertising campaign trouble

1905
01:38:51,926 --> 01:38:55,168
is very dull, very dry,
but very important.

1906
01:38:55,221 --> 01:38:56,586
Got a few minutes to talk?

1907
01:38:56,639 --> 01:38:58,675
Well, then, good night.

1908
01:38:58,724 --> 01:39:00,555
See you in the morning, bwana.

1909
01:39:04,897 --> 01:39:06,979
You like sleepin' too much
to come out at this hour

1910
01:39:07,024 --> 01:39:08,730
just about the campaign.

1911
01:39:08,776 --> 01:39:10,892
It's the village locksmith,

1912
01:39:10,945 --> 01:39:13,186
he sounds like he wants
to turn a key on you.

1913
01:39:13,239 --> 01:39:14,820
Barney Yale.

1914
01:39:14,866 --> 01:39:16,731
You'd better go see him.

1915
01:39:25,042 --> 01:39:26,782
How did you get in here?

1916
01:39:31,174 --> 01:39:33,444
Thought you understood I didn't
want to see you again, ever.

1917
01:39:33,468 --> 01:39:36,210
Well, I'm sorry, Frankie,
but a situation came up.

1918
01:39:36,262 --> 01:39:38,344
I thought you'd better
talk about it.

1919
01:39:38,389 --> 01:39:41,256
You picked some dumb stupid time
to want to chew the fat.

1920
01:39:43,227 --> 01:39:44,842
Our deal was I wouldn't tell

1921
01:39:44,896 --> 01:39:47,057
who hired me
to dig into your past.

1922
01:39:47,106 --> 01:39:49,097
I'm not goin' back on that.

1923
01:39:49,150 --> 01:39:51,106
But a couple
of public relations guys

1924
01:39:51,152 --> 01:39:53,359
called to feel me out.

1925
01:39:53,404 --> 01:39:56,612
They work for
two of the other nominees.

1926
01:39:56,657 --> 01:39:59,114
They wanted to know
how much it would cost for me

1927
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:03,904
to let the newspapers know
that it wasn't their clients

1928
01:40:03,956 --> 01:40:05,241
who hired me.

1929
01:40:05,291 --> 01:40:07,873
This is starting to smell, Yale.

1930
01:40:07,919 --> 01:40:10,410
Put a little chlorophyll
in the conversation.

1931
01:40:12,215 --> 01:40:15,048
Listen, Frankie, this could
mean as much as twenty grand.

1932
01:40:15,092 --> 01:40:17,424
There are four other nominees.

1933
01:40:17,470 --> 01:40:18,835
I need that money, Frankie.

1934
01:40:18,888 --> 01:40:20,503
With the divorce and all,
I can use it.

1935
01:40:20,556 --> 01:40:23,514
Now you win that Oscar,
you stand to make millions.

1936
01:40:23,559 --> 01:40:24,890
Why shouldn't I get a few bucks?

1937
01:40:24,936 --> 01:40:26,801
It only seems fair.

1938
01:40:28,648 --> 01:40:32,266
You know I got a good reputation
in this town,

1939
01:40:32,318 --> 01:40:34,104
everybody knows
I can be trusted,

1940
01:40:34,153 --> 01:40:37,190
I don't reveal a client.

1941
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:42,701
I'm not tellin' who hired me,
just who didn't.

1942
01:40:42,745 --> 01:40:44,505
Ah, but just to stay tight
with you, Frankie,

1943
01:40:44,539 --> 01:40:46,370
I'd settle for fifteen grand.

1944
01:40:46,415 --> 01:40:49,782
Now, I'm voluntarily cuttin'
myself out of five big ones.

1945
01:40:49,835 --> 01:40:51,188
Barney, I hope
you're gonna believe this

1946
01:40:51,212 --> 01:40:52,622
because it's the truth.

1947
01:40:52,672 --> 01:40:54,333
I haven't got it.

1948
01:40:57,885 --> 01:41:00,217
Look, I don't care
if you think I'm dumb,

1949
01:41:00,263 --> 01:41:02,629
but just don't talk me dumb.

1950
01:41:02,682 --> 01:41:05,719
Frankie, you live
in a bel air mansion,

1951
01:41:05,768 --> 01:41:08,555
this is 65 feet of yacht,

1952
01:41:08,604 --> 01:41:10,219
and you drive around
in those cars...

1953
01:41:10,273 --> 01:41:12,480
All in hock, up to the ears.
I haven't got a dime.

1954
01:41:12,525 --> 01:41:14,516
I come up empty, empty!

1955
01:41:20,408 --> 01:41:22,615
Now, this ain't right, Frankie.

1956
01:41:22,660 --> 01:41:26,244
I didn't have to come up here
to offer you this chance.

1957
01:41:26,289 --> 01:41:28,575
The least you can do
is deal me straight!

1958
01:41:28,624 --> 01:41:31,661
Now, look, 15 grand to you
is like a drop in the bucket.

1959
01:41:31,711 --> 01:41:34,248
I know how you guys live,
that's walkin'-around money.

1960
01:41:34,297 --> 01:41:35,816
What the hell's the matter
with you, Barney?

1961
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:37,455
Are you deaf?
I said I haven't got it!

1962
01:41:37,508 --> 01:41:39,590
Stop shuckin' me, Fane.

1963
01:41:39,635 --> 01:41:42,798
I want that 15
or I tell those PR guys

1964
01:41:42,847 --> 01:41:45,554
I'm takin' 'em up
on their offer.

1965
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:47,386
Now the ballots are in the mail.

1966
01:41:47,435 --> 01:41:48,891
In a few days
they'll have voted.

1967
01:41:48,936 --> 01:41:52,178
My word won't be worth a dollar.

1968
01:41:52,231 --> 01:41:53,562
You got 48 hours.

1969
01:41:53,608 --> 01:41:55,688
That's what they gave me.
That's what I'm givin' you.

1970
01:41:57,320 --> 01:42:01,233
I can't afford to let you
do me out of that money.

1971
01:42:01,282 --> 01:42:02,897
I expected better
from a guy like you.

1972
01:42:02,950 --> 01:42:04,440
I figured you'd treat me square.

1973
01:42:04,493 --> 01:42:06,449
You must be nuts!

1974
01:42:06,495 --> 01:42:08,781
You blackmail me!

1975
01:42:08,831 --> 01:42:11,117
And you're insulted
I don't want to pay.

1976
01:42:15,463 --> 01:42:18,250
You got 48 hours.

1977
01:42:18,299 --> 01:42:20,631
Don't waste a minute of it.

1978
01:42:23,512 --> 01:42:25,048
Please.

1979
01:42:32,855 --> 01:42:34,971
Out of town? Where out of town?

1980
01:42:35,024 --> 01:42:36,335
Well, what's he doing
in Baltimore?

1981
01:42:36,359 --> 01:42:38,020
- Where in Baltimore?
- Benzie? Hymie.

1982
01:42:38,069 --> 01:42:40,481
Listen, I'm trying to locate
a chick named trina Yale.

1983
01:42:40,529 --> 01:42:42,507
She used to me married to...
Yeah, right, that's the one.

1984
01:42:42,531 --> 01:42:44,531
Have him call me the minute
he gets in, understand?

1985
01:42:44,575 --> 01:42:46,190
- The minute he gets in!
- Okay, do it!

1986
01:42:46,243 --> 01:42:48,780
Listen, I'll make it up to you,
just call me back!

1987
01:42:48,829 --> 01:42:50,182
Kappy's housekeeper
says he's in Baltimore,

1988
01:42:50,206 --> 01:42:51,326
won't be back until morning.

1989
01:42:51,374 --> 01:42:53,143
He say anything to you
about going to Baltimore?

1990
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:55,312
Uh-uh. Benzie's gonna check
the independent's extra list,

1991
01:42:55,336 --> 01:42:57,076
but he doesn't think
trina Yale's in it.

1992
01:42:57,129 --> 01:42:59,120
He thinks she's listed
with central casting.

1993
01:42:59,173 --> 01:43:01,004
When I need him,
what's he doing in Baltimore?

1994
01:43:01,050 --> 01:43:02,790
Look, there's nothing else
I can do tonight.

1995
01:43:02,843 --> 01:43:05,129
First thing in the morning
I'll call every agent in town,

1996
01:43:05,179 --> 01:43:07,010
all the studio
casting departments,

1997
01:43:07,056 --> 01:43:08,492
see if anybody
can put a trace on her.

1998
01:43:08,516 --> 01:43:09,847
I'll find her, Frankie.

1999
01:43:09,892 --> 01:43:11,453
There's no time, hymie.
Don't you understand?

2000
01:43:11,477 --> 01:43:12,762
No time!

2001
01:43:12,812 --> 01:43:15,269
The nutcracker closes, chomp,
we're outta business.

2002
01:43:15,314 --> 01:43:16,520
Take it easy.

2003
01:43:16,565 --> 01:43:18,806
It's not gonna help
if you get a thrombo.

2004
01:43:18,859 --> 01:43:20,770
Go home, get some sleep!

2005
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:23,106
There's nothing else
you can do tonight.

2006
01:43:25,032 --> 01:43:26,488
I told you,
you lie down with pigs,

2007
01:43:26,534 --> 01:43:28,365
you come up
smellin' like garbage!

2008
01:43:28,411 --> 01:43:29,651
Eh!

2009
01:43:33,833 --> 01:43:35,118
Phone call for you, bwana.

2010
01:43:35,167 --> 01:43:37,453
Kappy.

2011
01:43:37,503 --> 01:43:38,689
Kappy, where the hell
have you been?

2012
01:43:38,713 --> 01:43:40,169
Why didn't you stay in touch?

2013
01:43:40,214 --> 01:43:41,920
I need $15,000, I need it now.

2014
01:43:41,966 --> 01:43:43,297
I'm really desperate.

2015
01:43:43,342 --> 01:43:45,549
Don't move, I'll be right over.

2016
01:43:51,934 --> 01:43:53,140
Thanks, kappy.

2017
01:43:53,185 --> 01:43:54,516
You don't know how much.

2018
01:43:54,562 --> 01:43:57,520
That's... that's not the money,
Frankie.

2019
01:43:57,565 --> 01:43:59,146
That's your agency release.

2020
01:43:59,191 --> 01:44:01,648
I'm no longer your agent.

2021
01:44:01,694 --> 01:44:05,232
One of us is losing his mind.
What are you trying to do to me?

2022
01:44:05,281 --> 01:44:07,738
Like the snake that sheds
his skin, Frankie Fane,

2023
01:44:07,783 --> 01:44:09,148
I'm getting rid of you.

2024
01:44:09,201 --> 01:44:11,317
What are you talking about,
kappy?

2025
01:44:11,370 --> 01:44:13,656
I'm the hottest now
I've ever been.

2026
01:44:13,706 --> 01:44:15,100
Now ['ll start getting
what I'm worth,

2027
01:44:15,124 --> 01:44:16,739
the real big money.

2028
01:44:16,792 --> 01:44:18,248
I'm gonna win that Oscar!

2029
01:44:18,294 --> 01:44:20,455
Perhaps you will.

2030
01:44:20,504 --> 01:44:23,621
But do you want me to tell you
why you won that nomination?

2031
01:44:23,674 --> 01:44:26,256
Because you played the role
of a man without morals,

2032
01:44:26,302 --> 01:44:28,884
a man without ethics or decency.

2033
01:44:28,929 --> 01:44:32,137
You played the part of you,
yourself, Frankie Fane.

2034
01:44:32,183 --> 01:44:33,923
What you really are.

2035
01:44:33,976 --> 01:44:36,433
That's why you have
your release, Frankie.

2036
01:44:36,479 --> 01:44:38,811
I have no more time
left for you.

2037
01:44:38,856 --> 01:44:42,724
No more time to let you hurt me
and degrade me and use me.

2038
01:44:42,777 --> 01:44:46,611
Have you ever seen a moth
smashed against a window?

2039
01:44:46,655 --> 01:44:50,239
Leaves the dust of its wings.

2040
01:44:50,284 --> 01:44:52,115
You're like that, Frankie.

2041
01:44:52,161 --> 01:44:55,073
You leave a powder of dirt
everywhere you touch.

2042
01:44:55,122 --> 01:44:58,080
I'm no different from anybody
else in this damn town.

2043
01:44:58,125 --> 01:45:00,411
Oh, oh, that's not true,
Frankie, that's not true.

2044
01:45:00,461 --> 01:45:02,827
Oh, if it becomes a matter
of life or death,

2045
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:05,917
we have no other choice
then we hurt others,

2046
01:45:05,966 --> 01:45:08,753
but reluctantly.

2047
01:45:08,803 --> 01:45:11,840
I suppose you were
an unpleasant child,

2048
01:45:11,889 --> 01:45:14,801
even more unpleasant young man.

2049
01:45:14,850 --> 01:45:19,685
Now you're a vicious,
bitter adult.

2050
01:45:21,148 --> 01:45:23,605
I don't need your pity!

2051
01:45:23,651 --> 01:45:26,267
But you need my money.

2052
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:29,653
Let me have $15,000, kappy.

2053
01:45:29,698 --> 01:45:32,314
Stinkin' creep!

2054
01:45:32,368 --> 01:45:34,154
Hey, the sun is warm today.

2055
01:45:34,203 --> 01:45:36,319
Miserable flesh peddier!

2056
01:45:36,372 --> 01:45:39,034
I think I'll take
a nice rock steam bath.

2057
01:45:39,083 --> 01:45:41,165
Drop dead, damn youl!

2058
01:45:42,586 --> 01:45:44,451
No agent in town handles her.

2059
01:45:44,505 --> 01:45:47,087
Studio casting offices
haven't used her in years.

2060
01:45:47,132 --> 01:45:49,339
My chick at the extras guild
never heard of trina Yale.

2061
01:45:49,385 --> 01:45:50,487
Either she couldn't
afford a listing

2062
01:45:50,511 --> 01:45:51,591
in the players directory,

2063
01:45:51,637 --> 01:45:53,365
or she never made it
out of the extras league.

2064
01:45:53,389 --> 01:45:54,866
The only thing I could do
was leave a message

2065
01:45:54,890 --> 01:45:56,175
with central casting.

2066
01:45:56,225 --> 01:45:58,119
She's gotta check in there
if she's out hustling work,

2067
01:45:58,143 --> 01:45:59,474
otherwise we're stopped.

2068
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:00,885
Nothing.

2069
01:46:00,938 --> 01:46:01,998
Well, you started it, Frankie.

2070
01:46:02,022 --> 01:46:03,228
What do you expect?

2071
01:46:03,274 --> 01:46:05,310
I know, I know.
Your favorite dumb line:

2072
01:46:05,359 --> 01:46:07,816
Lie down with pigs,
get up smellin" like garbage.

2073
01:46:07,862 --> 01:46:09,443
Well, can't you reason
with Yale?

2074
01:46:09,488 --> 01:46:10,819
Sure I can reason with him,

2075
01:46:10,865 --> 01:46:12,947
but it will take
15,000 green reasons.

2076
01:46:12,992 --> 01:46:15,825
You tell me where I'm gonna
dig up that much logic.

2077
01:46:17,329 --> 01:46:20,571
Oh, damn, I'm scared.

2078
01:46:20,624 --> 01:46:23,161
Hymie, you're the one guy
who can understand. I'm scared.

2079
01:46:23,210 --> 01:46:24,771
If there was anything
I could do, I would do it,

2080
01:46:24,795 --> 01:46:26,080
I would, Frankie, I would.

2081
01:46:26,130 --> 01:46:29,088
We've got to stop him,
we've got to.

2082
01:46:29,133 --> 01:46:30,669
Hymie, help me.

2083
01:46:30,718 --> 01:46:31,798
Help me, hymie.

2084
01:46:31,844 --> 01:46:33,425
Frankie, don't!

2085
01:46:33,470 --> 01:46:34,960
Hymie, I'm scared.

2086
01:46:35,014 --> 01:46:38,051
I'm scared out of my mind.

2087
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:40,432
You're the one guy
who can understand why.

2088
01:46:40,477 --> 01:46:42,934
You were with me way back
when it all started.

2089
01:46:44,356 --> 01:46:45,766
We're gonna lose everything.

2090
01:46:45,816 --> 01:46:47,147
Frankie!

2091
01:46:47,192 --> 01:46:49,057
After all those years,

2092
01:46:49,111 --> 01:46:51,067
after everything
we've been through.

2093
01:46:51,113 --> 01:46:55,732
Oh, help me, hymie.

2094
01:46:55,784 --> 01:46:57,024
You're my friend.

2095
01:46:57,077 --> 01:46:59,113
He waited till
we were locked in,

2096
01:46:59,163 --> 01:47:02,496
till we had nowhere to go
if he pulled a thing like this.

2097
01:47:02,541 --> 01:47:04,327
I'd like to see him dead.

2098
01:47:04,376 --> 01:47:06,583
I'd like to see his grinning
kisser pounded to jelly,

2099
01:47:06,629 --> 01:47:09,371
break his arms,
bust him up good.

2100
01:47:09,423 --> 01:47:11,505
We can't let him
roll over us like this.

2101
01:47:11,550 --> 01:47:13,632
Hymie, we've got to stop him,
we've got to do it!

2102
01:47:13,677 --> 01:47:16,510
Frankie, you don't know
what you're talking about!

2103
01:47:16,555 --> 01:47:18,216
We can stop him.

2104
01:47:18,265 --> 01:47:21,223
We can stop the bastard.

2105
01:47:21,268 --> 01:47:23,179
We get some guys to do it.
You know some guys.

2106
01:47:23,228 --> 01:47:24,908
Frankie, you don't know
what you're sayin'!

2107
01:47:24,939 --> 01:47:26,833
Hymie, it's gotta be like that.
Don't ya see, it's him or us.

2108
01:47:26,857 --> 01:47:28,710
You said you wanted to help.
All the years we been together.

2109
01:47:28,734 --> 01:47:29,940
Well, now it comes down to it:

2110
01:47:29,985 --> 01:47:31,771
In for a penny
is in for a pound.

2111
01:47:31,820 --> 01:47:34,174
Don't back out on me, hymie.
I've got no one else to turn to.

2112
01:47:34,198 --> 01:47:35,634
Frankie, you're not
making any sense!

2113
01:47:35,658 --> 01:47:37,719
Otherwise we lose everything!
Where do we go from here?

2114
01:47:37,743 --> 01:47:40,450
Where do you go?
What does he matter to us?

2115
01:47:40,496 --> 01:47:42,223
You're movin' too fast.
Let me think, let me think!

2116
01:47:42,247 --> 01:47:43,975
There's no time to think.
There's no time to think.

2117
01:47:43,999 --> 01:47:45,679
Hymie, it's just the two of us,
you and me.

2118
01:47:45,709 --> 01:47:46,994
We trust each other, hymie.

2119
01:47:47,044 --> 01:47:48,146
I don't know, Frankie,
I don't know.

2120
01:47:48,170 --> 01:47:49,956
Oh, hymie,
don't cop out on me now.

2121
01:47:50,005 --> 01:47:51,858
- We've got to stop Yale!
- I don't know, Frankie.

2122
01:47:51,882 --> 01:47:53,042
Do it, hymie, do it!

2123
01:47:53,092 --> 01:47:54,457
- Do it!
- No, damn it, Frankie!

2124
01:47:54,510 --> 01:47:56,216
No, I said no!

2125
01:47:57,012 --> 01:47:58,343
Hymie! Hymie!

2126
01:47:58,389 --> 01:48:01,347
Hymie, help me!

2127
01:48:08,399 --> 01:48:10,390
Bwana, who stomped you?

2128
01:48:11,485 --> 01:48:13,396
Shut up.

2129
01:48:13,445 --> 01:48:15,060
Get me a drink.

2130
01:48:19,868 --> 01:48:22,701
There was a phone call for you,
a miss brightly.

2131
01:48:26,291 --> 01:48:27,622
Who?

2132
01:48:29,503 --> 01:48:31,710
Trina brightly's
my show biz name.

2133
01:48:31,755 --> 01:48:33,746
They put two and two together
in central casting.

2134
01:48:33,799 --> 01:48:36,040
Only one other trina's
registered.

2135
01:48:36,093 --> 01:48:37,445
We had such a good time
in Tijuana,

2136
01:48:37,469 --> 01:48:39,425
I thought we'd pick it up
from here.

2137
01:48:47,438 --> 01:48:48,748
Figured we'd get
hammered together

2138
01:48:48,772 --> 01:48:50,763
and wrestle around on the couch
for a while?

2139
01:48:50,816 --> 01:48:52,431
How about that?

2140
01:48:52,484 --> 01:48:55,897
So, Barney pulled
the plug on you, huh?

2141
01:48:55,946 --> 01:48:57,937
I don't know what you mean.

2142
01:48:57,990 --> 01:49:02,154
Okay, we'll play it like
I'm the jerk you think I am.

2143
01:49:02,202 --> 01:49:04,693
Tell me a little story.

2144
01:49:04,747 --> 01:49:08,365
All right, you know the story,
it's been in all the papers.

2145
01:49:08,417 --> 01:49:10,499
Your ex sprang
a rotten lie on me

2146
01:49:10,544 --> 01:49:12,375
and got me clobbered
for the Oscar.

2147
01:49:12,421 --> 01:49:14,190
Now he's got something else
that's an even bigger lie

2148
01:49:14,214 --> 01:49:17,377
and he's threatenin' to open it
up if I don't pay off.

2149
01:49:17,426 --> 01:49:19,257
Finished with the fairy tales?

2150
01:49:19,303 --> 01:49:20,839
Fairy tales?

2151
01:49:20,888 --> 01:49:23,800
I'm tryin' to tell you your pal
Barney is crucifyin' me.

2152
01:49:27,019 --> 01:49:28,884
You're a beautiful liar.

2153
01:49:28,937 --> 01:49:32,600
Don't forget
I lived with Barney.

2154
01:49:32,649 --> 01:49:34,935
Oh, you're not the first one.

2155
01:49:34,985 --> 01:49:37,692
Sure, Barney never
reveals his clients.

2156
01:49:37,738 --> 01:49:39,194
If he did
he'd be killing the goose

2157
01:49:39,239 --> 01:49:41,571
that lays
his golden rotten eggs.

2158
01:49:41,617 --> 01:49:43,323
Because when Barney
pulls off a job

2159
01:49:43,368 --> 01:49:45,199
that's "under the counter,"

2160
01:49:45,245 --> 01:49:46,906
he waits until it's all done.

2161
01:49:46,955 --> 01:49:48,741
Then he Springs for more loot.

2162
01:49:48,791 --> 01:49:51,123
So, they pay off.

2163
01:49:51,168 --> 01:49:53,784
Barney never has
to reveal a client.

2164
01:49:55,089 --> 01:49:58,422
Now, when I saw it
in the papers about you,

2165
01:49:58,467 --> 01:50:00,833
I figured like everybody else

2166
01:50:00,886 --> 01:50:03,047
it might be any one
of the other four nominees

2167
01:50:03,097 --> 01:50:05,304
who hired Barney.

2168
01:50:05,349 --> 01:50:08,591
But now that your curly
little head shows up here

2169
01:50:08,644 --> 01:50:11,852
and you say that Barney's
springing on you too,

2170
01:50:11,897 --> 01:50:14,809
I get a hot flash that, maybe,

2171
01:50:14,858 --> 01:50:20,694
now just maybe,
you are the client.

2172
01:50:20,739 --> 01:50:23,276
Uh, I, uh...

2173
01:50:25,077 --> 01:50:29,446
You look so silly with your
mouth wide open, sweetness,

2174
01:50:29,498 --> 01:50:32,706
I haven't got the heart
to turn you down.

2175
01:50:32,751 --> 01:50:35,117
Save the booze,
let's talk business.

2176
01:50:38,382 --> 01:50:42,421
Inside that chorus girl head,
you've got a guillotine.

2177
01:50:42,469 --> 01:50:47,304
Inside that chorus girl head,
I've got a lot of sad.

2178
01:50:47,349 --> 01:50:48,714
L, ah, married Barney

2179
01:50:48,767 --> 01:50:52,009
because he said
he'd get me in pictures.

2180
01:50:52,062 --> 01:50:56,726
But all I got was Barney,
and I'm still an extra.

2181
01:50:56,775 --> 01:51:00,859
Now, I don't trust you
any more than I do Barney.

2182
01:51:00,904 --> 01:51:04,192
On the other hand,
what have I got to lose?

2183
01:51:04,241 --> 01:51:07,984
There's nobody breaking down
my door to make me a star.

2184
01:51:08,036 --> 01:51:09,776
If you win that Oscar,

2185
01:51:09,830 --> 01:51:11,866
you're going to be
a very important man

2186
01:51:11,915 --> 01:51:14,327
in this town.

2187
01:51:14,376 --> 01:51:17,834
I scratch your back,
you scratch mine.

2188
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:19,711
You can call your shots
with me, trina.

2189
01:51:19,756 --> 01:51:21,087
Anything you say.

2190
01:51:25,345 --> 01:51:27,586
Barney has six
safety deposit boxes,

2191
01:51:27,639 --> 01:51:29,175
six different names.

2192
01:51:29,224 --> 01:51:30,839
All the shakedown money
he's made,

2193
01:51:30,893 --> 01:51:33,350
and there is a pile, baby,

2194
01:51:33,395 --> 01:51:34,680
none of which he's reported

2195
01:51:34,730 --> 01:51:37,437
to the internal
revenue department.

2196
01:51:37,482 --> 01:51:40,440
I learned about this scam
a long time ago.

2197
01:51:40,485 --> 01:51:41,895
Barney didn't know.

2198
01:51:45,699 --> 01:51:50,284
I was saving it for a rainy day.

2199
01:51:50,329 --> 01:51:51,944
How's the weather, lover?

2200
01:51:54,082 --> 01:51:56,744
First of all,
there's Chester tumwater.

2201
01:52:06,136 --> 01:52:08,092
Chester tumwater.

2202
01:52:11,516 --> 01:52:13,302
You made your point.

2203
01:52:14,770 --> 01:52:17,102
Ya know, Frankie.

2204
01:52:17,147 --> 01:52:18,762
No wonder you're
gonna win that Oscar.

2205
01:52:20,442 --> 01:52:23,354
You've got to
with a mind like yours.

2206
01:52:23,403 --> 01:52:26,315
It'd be a travesty of justice
if you didn't.

2207
01:52:31,036 --> 01:52:32,276
Where's my lord and master?

2208
01:52:32,329 --> 01:52:33,660
In having dinner.

2209
01:52:38,710 --> 01:52:40,041
Hey, seen the newspaper polls?

2210
01:52:40,087 --> 01:52:41,327
They're pickin' me to win.

2211
01:52:42,506 --> 01:52:43,996
You're no man.

2212
01:52:44,049 --> 01:52:46,040
You're some kind of poison.

2213
01:52:46,093 --> 01:52:48,004
You're lushed.

2214
01:52:48,053 --> 01:52:50,965
Hymie, let Sam take you inside
to lie down for a few minutes.

2215
01:52:51,014 --> 01:52:52,242
Tell me, old buddy,
what happened?

2216
01:52:52,266 --> 01:52:53,847
No, wait a minute, let me guess.

2217
01:52:53,892 --> 01:52:55,852
Let me see, you got two
side boys from Kansas City

2218
01:52:55,894 --> 01:52:57,680
to dump old Barney Yale
in a cement mixer

2219
01:52:57,729 --> 01:52:59,811
and he's currently a mile
and a half of new freeway

2220
01:52:59,856 --> 01:53:01,084
- in Pasadena.
- What the hell's

2221
01:53:01,108 --> 01:53:02,393
your story, hymie?

2222
01:53:02,442 --> 01:53:03,477
What's wrong with you?

2223
01:53:03,527 --> 01:53:04,937
What's wrong with me?

2224
01:53:04,987 --> 01:53:06,602
You're wrong with me!

2225
01:53:06,655 --> 01:53:08,771
And for one split second
I almost went for it.

2226
01:53:08,824 --> 01:53:10,109
I almost went for it
all the way,

2227
01:53:10,158 --> 01:53:11,898
ready to cream Barney Yale!

2228
01:53:11,952 --> 01:53:14,238
I never said anything
about creamin' Barney Yale.

2229
01:53:14,288 --> 01:53:16,279
Birdseed, daddy!
That's exactly what you said!

2230
01:53:16,331 --> 01:53:17,600
You wanted him dead,
you wanted him killed,

2231
01:53:17,624 --> 01:53:19,160
you wanted him murdered.

2232
01:53:19,209 --> 01:53:22,292
And for one tiny moment
I almost went for it.

2233
01:53:22,337 --> 01:53:23,648
What is he talking about,
Frankie?

2234
01:53:23,672 --> 01:53:25,583
He's smashed!
He's out of his mind.

2235
01:53:25,632 --> 01:53:27,694
Yeah, I been out of my mind
all the years I been followin'

2236
01:53:27,718 --> 01:53:29,629
behind you, walkin'
the same mud holes you do.

2237
01:53:29,678 --> 01:53:31,030
I think I better
throw you out of here

2238
01:53:31,054 --> 01:53:32,407
and let you dry out
on the front lawn!

2239
01:53:32,431 --> 01:53:33,700
You're not gonna
have to throw me out.

2240
01:53:33,724 --> 01:53:35,589
I'm gonna walk.
But first you're gonna listen

2241
01:53:35,642 --> 01:53:37,245
because I've got somethin'
to square away.

2242
01:53:37,269 --> 01:53:39,476
Everything you did for me
in exchange for Laurel.

2243
01:53:39,521 --> 01:53:41,477
What the hell has Laurel
got to do with this?

2244
01:53:41,523 --> 01:53:43,730
I married her, remember?

2245
01:53:43,775 --> 01:53:45,356
She was what you call a wife.

2246
01:53:45,402 --> 01:53:47,563
She was also
what you call a mother...

2247
01:53:47,612 --> 01:53:49,443
- Almost a mother.
- Stop talkin' around it!

2248
01:53:49,489 --> 01:53:51,070
If you got something
on your weak mind,

2249
01:53:51,116 --> 01:53:52,526
spit it out.

2250
01:53:52,576 --> 01:53:54,487
She died on the table,
ya bastard!

2251
01:53:54,536 --> 01:53:56,868
She died under the knife,
she miscarried.

2252
01:53:56,913 --> 01:53:58,119
What's that got to do with me?

2253
01:53:58,165 --> 01:53:59,405
It was your baby!

2254
01:54:03,628 --> 01:54:05,459
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yeah, you're sorry.

2255
01:54:05,505 --> 01:54:07,191
You're so sorry
you pull her out of the grave

2256
01:54:07,215 --> 01:54:08,943
and made her a whore in
every newspaper in the world.

2257
01:54:08,967 --> 01:54:10,567
So don't say you're sorry,
or so help me,

2258
01:54:10,594 --> 01:54:12,300
I swear I'll tear
your throat out!

2259
01:54:15,349 --> 01:54:17,681
You know what I did when I ran
out this morning, Frankie?

2260
01:54:17,726 --> 01:54:21,560
I ran and I ran and I didn't
even know where I was going.

2261
01:54:23,273 --> 01:54:26,060
And after a while
my face grew cold

2262
01:54:26,109 --> 01:54:29,146
and I started ballin'.

2263
01:54:29,196 --> 01:54:30,982
You know what I was cryin' for,
Frankie?

2264
01:54:31,031 --> 01:54:33,192
For all the years
that I haven't been me.

2265
01:54:33,241 --> 01:54:34,469
For all the years
that I've been sittin'

2266
01:54:34,493 --> 01:54:36,154
like an extra nose on your face.

2267
01:54:36,203 --> 01:54:38,194
What happened to me?
When did I die?

2268
01:54:38,246 --> 01:54:40,487
When did I get buried
inside you?

2269
01:54:40,540 --> 01:54:41,905
I'm so much a part of you,
Frankie,

2270
01:54:41,958 --> 01:54:43,061
that when I shave in the morning

2271
01:54:43,085 --> 01:54:45,701
I see your face in the mirror.

2272
01:54:45,754 --> 01:54:47,961
I ran, Frankie,
I ran into an alley.

2273
01:54:48,006 --> 01:54:50,964
Down at the end of it
I fell behind some crates.

2274
01:54:51,009 --> 01:54:53,671
I don't know for how long,

2275
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:57,258
but I was just twitchin'
just like a spastic.

2276
01:54:57,307 --> 01:54:58,638
I couldn't stop.

2277
01:54:58,683 --> 01:55:01,220
Frankie,
I'm nothing but a parasite.

2278
01:55:01,269 --> 01:55:05,387
I've never had the guts
to tear myself away from you.

2279
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:07,522
I've let you castrate me
inch by inch.

2280
01:55:07,567 --> 01:55:09,603
I'm weak! I'm a leech!

2281
01:55:09,653 --> 01:55:11,439
He's the one
who hired Barney Yale!

2282
01:55:17,369 --> 01:55:18,905
You shut up, hymie!

2283
01:55:18,954 --> 01:55:22,071
I don't want to have
to bust you up!

2284
01:55:22,124 --> 01:55:24,310
Don't listen to that drunk.
He's talkin' out of a bottle.

2285
01:55:24,334 --> 01:55:25,915
He doesn't know
what he's saying.

2286
01:55:28,964 --> 01:55:30,149
If there's one thing
that somebody can learn

2287
01:55:30,173 --> 01:55:31,234
from a guy like you, Frankie,

2288
01:55:31,258 --> 01:55:32,293
it's what I've learned:

2289
01:55:32,342 --> 01:55:34,128
Don't be afraid to fight dirty.

2290
01:55:42,853 --> 01:55:44,514
Look at you, Frankie.

2291
01:55:44,563 --> 01:55:46,599
Look at what's left of you.

2292
01:55:46,648 --> 01:55:49,811
There isn't even enough
to feel sorry for.

2293
01:55:49,860 --> 01:55:53,193
And now I know
there isn't enough to love.

2294
01:55:53,238 --> 01:55:56,275
How could I think
there was hope for us,

2295
01:55:56,324 --> 01:56:00,158
or anything between us?

2296
01:56:00,203 --> 01:56:03,661
Maybe it takes a terrible thing
like this tonight,

2297
01:56:03,707 --> 01:56:06,414
this senseless evil.

2298
01:56:06,460 --> 01:56:09,623
Do you at least know that's
what it is, Frankie, do you?

2299
01:56:09,671 --> 01:56:11,536
Maybe it takes
something this strong

2300
01:56:11,590 --> 01:56:14,502
to cure a woman like me.

2301
01:56:14,551 --> 01:56:17,133
Whatever there was
between us, Frankie,

2302
01:56:17,179 --> 01:56:19,170
you could never call it love,

2303
01:56:19,222 --> 01:56:22,680
because to love means to commit
yourself and to belong.

2304
01:56:22,726 --> 01:56:26,389
And you never belonged to
anybody but yourself, Frankie!

2305
01:56:26,438 --> 01:56:29,555
And when you don't belong,
nothing belongs to you.

2306
01:56:29,608 --> 01:56:32,645
So you may have your Oscar,
and you may have everything,

2307
01:56:32,694 --> 01:56:34,525
and you'll have nothing.

2308
01:56:36,239 --> 01:56:39,481
Hymie, please, I...

2309
01:56:39,534 --> 01:56:41,240
Please take me out of here.

2310
01:56:41,286 --> 01:56:43,402
Just anywhere, please?

2311
01:56:45,499 --> 01:56:47,160
Bye, Frankie.

2312
01:56:47,209 --> 01:56:51,077
And I do hope the Oscar
keeps you warm on cold nights.

2313
01:56:55,050 --> 01:56:56,915
Go on and run.

2314
01:56:56,968 --> 01:56:58,504
Who the hell needs you!

2315
01:57:01,473 --> 01:57:03,555
Too stupid to understand.

2316
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:06,182
This damn town wasn't tryin'
to pull your guts out.

2317
01:57:06,228 --> 01:57:08,685
Nobody was trying
to shove you into a sewer.

2318
01:57:08,730 --> 01:57:10,686
Look around,
go ahead, look around!

2319
01:57:10,732 --> 01:57:12,518
How does anybody win?

2320
01:57:13,985 --> 01:57:16,067
Oh, you're too stupid
to know that.

2321
01:57:16,112 --> 01:57:18,649
I'm going to win,
and that's what counts.

2322
01:57:18,698 --> 01:57:20,404
I'm gonna win!

2323
01:57:20,450 --> 01:57:22,486
Go on and run, you freeloaders.

2324
01:57:22,536 --> 01:57:23,651
Go on, run.

2325
01:57:23,703 --> 01:57:25,694
Who needs yal who needs yal!

2326
01:57:25,747 --> 01:57:27,032
Freeloaders.

2327
01:57:27,082 --> 01:57:28,197
Freeloaders!

2328
01:57:32,295 --> 01:57:34,035
And youl!

2329
01:57:34,089 --> 01:57:35,795
You too, ya creep!

2330
01:57:35,840 --> 01:57:37,080
What are you lookin' at?

2331
01:57:37,133 --> 01:57:38,748
I suppose you want out too.

2332
01:57:38,802 --> 01:57:41,134
Well go on,
get the hell outta here.

2333
01:57:43,557 --> 01:57:45,138
Go on.

2334
01:57:45,183 --> 01:57:46,218
Go!

2335
01:58:01,741 --> 01:58:03,902
The award
for the best actor of the year

2336
01:58:03,952 --> 01:58:06,614
will be presented
by the elegant and beautiful

2337
01:58:06,663 --> 01:58:08,073
miss merle oberon.

2338
01:58:19,968 --> 01:58:22,584

01:58:37,277 --> 01:58:40,110
on top of the glass mountain
where you wanted to be,

2346
01:58:40,155 --> 01:58:42,646
looking down at the rest of us.

2347
01:58:42,699 --> 01:58:46,237
I hate to admit it
but you proved your point.

2348
01:58:46,286 --> 01:58:50,029
It looks like it is the only
way to climb that high.

2349
01:58:50,081 --> 01:58:51,412
The envelope, please.

2350
01:58:53,585 --> 01:58:54,620
Thank you.

2351
01:58:57,756 --> 01:59:00,247
And the winner is...

2352
01:59:00,300 --> 01:59:02,461
Frank Sinatra!

2353
01:59:25,992 --> 01:59:27,027
Thank you.

2354
01:59:27,077 --> 01:59:28,533
Thank you very much.
