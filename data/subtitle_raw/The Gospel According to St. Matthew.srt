1
00:00:31,207 --> 00:00:34,916
THE GOSPEL
ACCORDING TO ST MATTHEW

2
00:02:43,967 --> 00:02:47,926
To the dear, joyous familiar
memory of Pope John XXIII

3
00:05:22,327 --> 00:05:27,162
Joseph, fear not to take Mary
as your wife...

4
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:31,320
...for she has conceived by the
power of the Holy Ghost.

5
00:05:31,487 --> 00:05:34,206
She will bear a son whom you
will call Jesus...

6
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:38,076
...for he is to save his people
from their sins.

7
00:05:42,407 --> 00:05:45,399
The virgin shall be with child...

8
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:47,319
...and shall bear a son...

9
00:05:47,487 --> 00:05:50,718
...and they shall call him Emmanuel,
meaning God with us.

10
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,038
Where has the king of the Jews
been born?

11
00:07:46,207 --> 00:07:50,962
We have seen his star in the east,
and have come to worship him.

12
00:08:15,447 --> 00:08:18,280
Where will Christ be born?

13
00:08:20,727 --> 00:08:23,605
At Bethlehem in Juda, the prophet
wrote:

14
00:08:23,767 --> 00:08:26,804
And you, Bethlehem, in the land
of Juda...

15
00:08:26,967 --> 00:08:30,323
...art far from the least
among the princes of Juda.

16
00:08:30,487 --> 00:08:33,206
For out of you will arise a leader...

17
00:08:33,367 --> 00:08:36,484
...who is to be the shepherd
of my people Israel"

18
00:09:38,647 --> 00:09:42,640
Seek the child, and when you
have found him...

19
00:09:42,807 --> 00:09:47,278
...bring me word so I too may come
and worship him.

20
00:14:54,087 --> 00:14:56,726
Take the child and his mother...

21
00:14:56,887 --> 00:15:00,243
...flee to Egypt and remain there
until I give you word.

22
00:15:00,407 --> 00:15:04,195
For Herod will soon search for
the child, to destroy him.

23
00:16:28,407 --> 00:16:31,877
I called my son out of Egypt.

24
00:18:51,167 --> 00:18:56,639
A voice was heard in Rama,
lamentation and great mourning.

25
00:18:56,807 --> 00:18:59,924
Rachel wept for her children...

26
00:19:00,087 --> 00:19:03,238
...she would not be comforted,
for none is left.

27
00:20:31,967 --> 00:20:35,596
Take the child and his mother
and return to Israel...

28
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:39,316
...for those who sought the
child's life are dead.

29
00:23:37,527 --> 00:23:42,123
Repent, the kingdom of heaven
is at hand.

30
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:49,204
It was of him that the prophet
Isaias spoke when he said:

31
00:23:49,367 --> 00:23:52,404
There is a voice of one crying
in the wilderness

32
00:23:52,567 --> 00:23:55,923
Prepare the way of the Lord...

33
00:23:56,087 --> 00:23:58,920
...straighten out his paths.

34
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:07,118
Brood of vipers! Who taught you to
flee the vengeance that draws near?

35
00:24:07,287 --> 00:24:10,199
Yield the acceptable fruit
of repentance.

36
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:16,397
Do not presume to say in your hearts:
We have Abraham for our father.

37
00:24:16,567 --> 00:24:21,197
God has power to raise up children
to Abraham out of these very stones.

38
00:24:21,367 --> 00:24:25,997
Already the axe has been put
to the root of the trees...

39
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:29,842
...so that every tree that
does not show good fruit...

40
00:24:30,007 --> 00:24:32,521
...will be hewn down
and cast into the fire.

41
00:24:38,647 --> 00:24:43,596
I am baptizing you with water,
for your repentance...

42
00:24:43,767 --> 00:24:48,397
...but one is to come after me
who is mightier than I...

43
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:53,800
...so that I am not worthy even
to carry his shoes for him.

44
00:24:55,607 --> 00:24:57,996
He will baptize you...

45
00:24:58,167 --> 00:25:02,797
...with the Holy Ghost and with fire.

46
00:25:02,967 --> 00:25:07,279
He holds his winnowing fan to sweep
his threshing-floor clean.

47
00:25:07,447 --> 00:25:11,122
He will gather the wheat
into his barn...

48
00:25:11,287 --> 00:25:16,042
...but the chaff he will consume
in unquenchable fire

49
00:26:29,887 --> 00:26:33,675
It is I that ought to be
baptized by you.

50
00:26:33,847 --> 00:26:35,803
Do you come to me?

51
00:26:38,647 --> 00:26:42,845
Let it be so for the present,
to fulfil due observance

52
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:18,804
This is my beloved Son...

53
00:27:18,967 --> 00:27:21,800
...in whom I am well pleased.

54
00:29:15,767 --> 00:29:20,397
If you are the Son of God,
turn these stones into bread.

55
00:29:20,567 --> 00:29:22,637
Man cannot live by bread alone...

56
00:29:22,807 --> 00:29:26,277
...but by all the words which
proceed from the mouth of God.

57
00:29:37,447 --> 00:29:42,157
If you are the Son of God, cast yourself
down to earth. For it is written:

58
00:29:42,327 --> 00:29:48,641
He has charged angels to watch over
you lest you should trip on a stone.

59
00:29:50,687 --> 00:29:55,886
It is further written: You shall not put
the Lord your God to the proof.

60
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:12,880
I will give you all these, If you
will fall down and worship me.

61
00:30:15,927 --> 00:30:17,679
Away with you, Satan!

62
00:30:17,847 --> 00:30:22,363
It is written: You shall worship the
Lord your God, and serve none but him.

63
00:30:59,127 --> 00:31:03,882
The people that abode in darkness
have seen a great light.

64
00:31:04,887 --> 00:31:10,359
For men living in a land where death
overshadowed them, light has dawned.

65
00:32:12,727 --> 00:32:16,356
Repent, the kingdom of heaven
is at hand.

66
00:32:49,207 --> 00:32:50,959
Peter.

67
00:32:53,687 --> 00:32:55,439
Andrew.

68
00:32:58,167 --> 00:33:01,318
Come and follow me; I will
make you fishers of men.

69
00:33:51,287 --> 00:33:54,802
James and John, sons of Zebedee,
come with me.

70
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:20,566
The harvest is plentiful,
but the labourers are few.

71
00:34:20,727 --> 00:34:25,801
Ask the Lord whose harvest it is
to send labourers for the harvesting.

72
00:34:31,927 --> 00:34:34,964
Peter...Andrew...

73
00:34:35,127 --> 00:34:39,723
...James...John...Philip...

74
00:34:41,527 --> 00:34:43,085
Thomas.

75
00:34:44,087 --> 00:34:45,964
Simon.

76
00:34:47,287 --> 00:34:48,845
Bartholomew.

77
00:34:51,127 --> 00:34:52,685
Thaddaeus.

78
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:57,481
James, son of Alphaeus.

79
00:35:00,087 --> 00:35:02,157
Matthew.

80
00:35:02,327 --> 00:35:04,204
Judas Iscariot.

81
00:35:06,207 --> 00:35:09,517
You shall be labourers for
the harvesting.

82
00:35:09,687 --> 00:35:12,406
I am sending you to be
like sheep among wolves.

83
00:35:12,567 --> 00:35:16,560
You must be wary as serpents,
yet innocent as doves

84
00:35:16,727 --> 00:35:19,764
Do not put your trust in men.

85
00:35:19,927 --> 00:35:24,557
They will deliver you to courts and
scourge you in their synagogues.

86
00:35:24,727 --> 00:35:28,720
On my account you will bear witness
before governors, kings and Gentiles.

87
00:35:28,887 --> 00:35:34,484
When you are given into their hands
do not fear what to say.

88
00:35:34,647 --> 00:35:38,117
Words will be given you
when the time comes.

89
00:35:39,007 --> 00:35:44,206
It is not you who speak, it is your
Father's Spirit that speaks in you.

90
00:35:48,727 --> 00:35:52,197
You will be hated by all men
because you bear my name.

91
00:35:52,367 --> 00:35:57,839
Fear not those who kill the body but
have no means of killing the soul.

92
00:35:58,007 --> 00:36:02,444
Fear him more who has the power
to ruin body and soul in hell.

93
00:36:07,607 --> 00:36:10,041
Are not sparrows sold
two for a penny?

94
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:16,406
Yet not one of them may fall to the
ground without your Father's will.

95
00:36:16,567 --> 00:36:18,637
Every hair of your head...

96
00:36:18,807 --> 00:36:20,877
...he takes into his reckoning.

97
00:36:21,047 --> 00:36:24,517
Fear not, you count more than
a host of sparrows.

98
00:36:27,767 --> 00:36:31,442
Do not imagine I have come
to bring peace to the earth.

99
00:36:31,607 --> 00:36:34,644
I have come to bring a sword,
not peace.

100
00:36:34,807 --> 00:36:39,119
I have come to set man at variance
with his father...

101
00:36:39,287 --> 00:36:42,324
...and the daughter with her mother.

102
00:36:42,487 --> 00:36:45,638
A man's enemies will be
the people of his own house

103
00:36:49,847 --> 00:36:55,240
He is not worthy of me, that loves
father or mother more.

104
00:36:59,767 --> 00:37:02,804
He who secures his own life
will lose it.

105
00:37:02,967 --> 00:37:06,755
It is the man who loses his life for
my sake that will secure it.

106
00:39:16,847 --> 00:39:19,600
Lord, If you will, make me clean.

107
00:39:19,767 --> 00:39:22,076
It is my will, be made clean.

108
00:39:33,887 --> 00:39:37,516
Tell no man, rather go and
show yourself to the priest..

109
00:39:37,687 --> 00:39:41,043
...and offer the gift which
Moses ordained...

110
00:39:41,207 --> 00:39:44,040
...to make the truth be known to them.

111
00:39:55,927 --> 00:39:59,602
Blessed are the poor in spirit;
the kingdom of heaven is theirs.

112
00:39:59,767 --> 00:40:02,486
Blessed are those who mourn;
they shall be comforted.

113
00:40:02,647 --> 00:40:05,036
Blessed are the patient;
they shall inherit the land.

114
00:40:05,207 --> 00:40:08,563
Blessed are those who hunger for
holiness; they shall have their fill.

115
00:40:08,727 --> 00:40:11,321
Blessed are the merciful;
they shall obtain mercy.

116
00:40:11,487 --> 00:40:13,955
Blessed are the clean of heart;
they shall see God.

117
00:40:14,127 --> 00:40:17,358
Blessed are the peace-makers; they
shall be counted the children of God.

118
00:40:17,527 --> 00:40:21,998
Those persecuted in right's cause;
the kingdom of heaven is theirs.

119
00:40:22,167 --> 00:40:25,523
Blessed are you, when men revile
you and persecute you...

120
00:40:25,687 --> 00:40:29,362
...and speak all manner of evil
against you falsely, because of me.

121
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:33,839
Be glad and light-hearted, a rich
reward awaits you in heaven.

122
00:40:34,007 --> 00:40:37,044
So it was they persecuted the
prophets who went before you.

123
00:40:37,207 --> 00:40:40,244
If your son asks for bread,
will you give him a stone?

124
00:40:40,407 --> 00:40:43,763
If he asks for a fish,
will you give him a serpent?

125
00:40:43,927 --> 00:40:48,557
If you, evil as you are, know
what is good for your children...

126
00:40:48,727 --> 00:40:54,324
...will not your Father in heaven give
more good gifts to those who ask?

127
00:40:54,487 --> 00:40:58,799
Do to other men all that you
would have them do to you.

128
00:40:58,967 --> 00:41:01,845
That is the law and the prophets.

129
00:41:02,807 --> 00:41:06,800
Do not think I have come to set aside
the law and the prophets.

130
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:10,004
I have come to bring them
to perfection.

131
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:15,446
You are the salt of the earth; if salt
loses salinity, what can restore it?

132
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:20,237
Nothing can be done with it but
throw it out to be trodden underfoot

133
00:41:20,407 --> 00:41:22,477
You are the light of the world.

134
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:25,684
A city on a mountain top
cannot be hidden.

135
00:41:25,847 --> 00:41:29,203
A lamp is not placed under a bushel...

136
00:41:29,367 --> 00:41:33,406
...it is put where it will
light the house

137
00:41:34,167 --> 00:41:36,886
Do not lay up treasure on earth...

138
00:41:37,047 --> 00:41:40,722
...where moth and rust consume it,
thieves break in and steal it.

139
00:41:40,887 --> 00:41:43,924
Lay up treasure for yourselves
in heaven...

140
00:41:44,087 --> 00:41:48,399
...where there is no moth or rust,
no thieves steal it.

141
00:41:48,567 --> 00:41:50,956
A man cannot serve two masters.

142
00:41:51,127 --> 00:41:56,076
He will hate one and love the other,
devote himself to one, scorn the other.

143
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:59,922
You may serve God or money;
you cannot serve both.

144
00:42:00,087 --> 00:42:04,717
When giving alms, let not your left
hand know what your right is doing...

145
00:42:04,887 --> 00:42:08,243
...so secret is your almsgiving to be.

146
00:42:08,407 --> 00:42:12,844
Then your Father, who sees what is
done in secret, will reward you.

147
00:42:14,047 --> 00:42:18,165
You have heard it said: An eye for
an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

148
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,716
I tell you, do not offer resistance.

149
00:42:20,887 --> 00:42:24,562
If a man strikes you on your
right cheek, turn the other.

150
00:42:24,727 --> 00:42:30,006
You have heard it said: Love your
neighbour and hate your enemy.

151
00:42:30,167 --> 00:42:34,479
I tell you: Love your enemies,
pray for those who persecute you...

152
00:42:34,647 --> 00:42:38,640
...so that you may be true sons of
your Father in heaven...

153
00:42:38,807 --> 00:42:42,163
...who makes his sun rise on the evil
and on the good...

154
00:42:42,327 --> 00:42:45,364
...his rain fall on the just
and on the unjust.

155
00:42:45,527 --> 00:42:48,883
Do not judge others, or you
yourselves will be judged.

156
00:42:49,047 --> 00:42:53,040
As you have judged, so you will
be judged, by the same rule.

157
00:42:53,207 --> 00:42:56,563
Award shall be made to you
as you have made award.

158
00:42:56,727 --> 00:42:59,764
How is it you see the speck
of dirt in your brother's eye...

159
00:42:59,927 --> 00:43:03,283
...and are not aware of the beam
which is in your own?

160
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:08,077
When you pray, do not use many
phrases, like the heathen...

161
00:43:08,247 --> 00:43:12,240
...who think to make themselves
heard by their eloquence.

162
00:43:12,407 --> 00:43:14,796
You are not to be like them.

163
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:19,279
Your Father knows well what your
needs are before you ask him.

164
00:43:19,447 --> 00:43:22,484
This, then, is to be your prayer:

165
00:43:22,647 --> 00:43:27,277
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

166
00:43:27,447 --> 00:43:32,396
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

167
00:43:32,567 --> 00:43:35,286
Give us this day our daily bread.

168
00:43:35,447 --> 00:43:40,396
And forgive us our trespasses, as we
forgive them that trespass against us.

169
00:43:40,567 --> 00:43:44,242
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

170
00:43:44,407 --> 00:43:49,037
Do not fret over your life, how to
support it with food and drink

171
00:43:49,207 --> 00:43:52,244
Over your body, how to
keep it clothed.

172
00:43:52,407 --> 00:43:56,525
is not life itself a greater gift
than food, the body than clothing?

173
00:43:59,127 --> 00:44:04,076
See the birds of the air never sow,
or reap, or gather grain into barns...

174
00:44:04,247 --> 00:44:07,603
...and yet your heavenly Father
feeds them.

175
00:44:07,767 --> 00:44:10,486
Have you not an excellence
beyond theirs?

176
00:44:10,647 --> 00:44:15,277
Can anyone of you add a cubit's
growth to his height?

177
00:44:15,447 --> 00:44:18,484
And why should you be anxious
over clothing?

178
00:44:18,647 --> 00:44:22,959
See how the lilies grow,
they do not toil or spin.

179
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:27,120
And yet I tell you that even Solomon
in all his glory...

180
00:44:27,287 --> 00:44:29,676
...was not arrayed like one of these.

181
00:44:29,847 --> 00:44:32,566
If God so clothes the grasses
of the field...

182
00:44:32,727 --> 00:44:35,764
...which today live and will feed
the oven tomorrow...

183
00:44:35,927 --> 00:44:39,602
...will he not be much more ready to
clothe you, men of little faith?

184
00:44:39,767 --> 00:44:43,760
Do not fret then, asking what you
will eat or drink or wear.

185
00:44:43,927 --> 00:44:48,239
It is for the heathen to busy
themselves over such things.

186
00:44:48,407 --> 00:44:52,719
You have a Father in heaven who knows
that you need them all.

187
00:44:52,887 --> 00:44:56,562
Make it your first care to find the
kingdom of God, and his approval...

188
00:44:56,727 --> 00:44:59,764
...and all these things shall be
yours without the asking.

189
00:44:59,927 --> 00:45:04,239
Do not fret over tomorrow, leave it
to fret over its own needs.

190
00:45:04,407 --> 00:45:08,082
For today, today's troubles
are enough.

191
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:10,966
Make your way in by the narrow gate.

192
00:45:11,127 --> 00:45:14,278
It is a broad gate and a wide road
that leads to perdition...

193
00:45:14,647 --> 00:45:17,366
...and those who go that way
are many indeed.

194
00:45:17,527 --> 00:45:21,520
How small the gate, how narrow
the road that leads to life...

195
00:45:21,687 --> 00:45:23,803
...and how few there are that find it.

196
00:45:25,127 --> 00:45:29,120
Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
I give you praise...

197
00:45:29,287 --> 00:45:33,280
...that you have hidden this from the
wise and revealed it to children.

198
00:45:33,447 --> 00:45:36,803
My Father has entrusted everything
into my hands.

199
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:40,004
None knows the Son truly
except the Father.

200
00:45:40,167 --> 00:45:42,237
None knows the Father truly
except the Son...

201
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:46,082
...and those to whom it is
the Son's pleasure to reveal him.

202
00:45:46,247 --> 00:45:49,922
Come to me all you that labour and
are burdened; I will give you rest.

203
00:45:50,087 --> 00:45:52,476
Take my yoke upon yourselves
and learn from me.

204
00:45:52,647 --> 00:45:57,357
I am gentle and humble of heart;
you shall find rest for your souls.

205
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:02,680
For my yoke is easy
and my burden is light.

206
00:47:19,247 --> 00:47:23,035
Your disciples are doing
what is not lawful on the Sabbath.

207
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:28,156
Have you never read what David did,
when he and his followers hungered?

208
00:47:28,327 --> 00:47:32,639
How he went into the tabernacle,
and ate the loaves set out there...

209
00:47:32,807 --> 00:47:37,437
...although neither he nor anyone but
the priest had the right to eat them?

210
00:47:37,607 --> 00:47:39,996
Have you not read in the law...

211
00:47:40,167 --> 00:47:46,083
...that priests violate the Sabbath
rest in the temple; none blames them?

212
00:47:46,247 --> 00:47:50,559
I tell you, there is one standing
here who is greater than the temple.

213
00:47:50,727 --> 00:47:54,720
If you understood the words:
I desire mercy, not sacrifice...

214
00:47:54,887 --> 00:47:57,276
...you would not condemn
the guiltless.

215
00:47:57,447 --> 00:48:00,519
The Son of Man has even
the Sabbath at his disposal.

216
00:48:49,847 --> 00:48:52,315
is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?

217
00:48:52,487 --> 00:48:55,843
If one of your sheep fell
into a pit...

218
00:48:56,007 --> 00:49:00,000
...would you not pull it out
on a Sabbath?

219
00:49:00,167 --> 00:49:05,321
What is a sheep compared to a man?
Mercy is not unlawful on the Sabbath.

220
00:49:12,327 --> 00:49:14,124
Throw away your crutches.

221
00:49:18,407 --> 00:49:21,763
Tell no man that you have
been healed...

222
00:49:21,927 --> 00:49:25,920
...so that the word spoken by
Isaias may be fulfilled.

223
00:49:26,087 --> 00:49:31,480
Behold my servant, my chosen,
with whom my soul is well pleased.

224
00:49:32,807 --> 00:49:37,119
I will lay my spirit on him, he shall
proclaim my rule among Gentiles.

225
00:49:37,287 --> 00:49:41,917
He will not protest and cry out; none
shall hear his voice in the streets.

226
00:49:42,087 --> 00:49:47,366
He will not break a bruised reed
or quench a smouldering wick...

227
00:49:47,527 --> 00:49:51,964
...until the time comes when he
crowns his judgement with victory.

228
00:49:55,247 --> 00:49:58,683
We must find a way to make a way
with him.

229
00:50:21,207 --> 00:50:24,165
It is past the accustomed hour.

230
00:50:24,327 --> 00:50:27,046
Let the multitudes buy food
in the villages.

231
00:50:27,207 --> 00:50:30,244
It is for you to give them food.

232
00:50:30,407 --> 00:50:32,796
We have only five loaves and
two fishes.

233
00:50:32,967 --> 00:50:35,083
Bring them to me.

234
00:51:59,367 --> 00:52:02,837
I am going to pray. Take ship
and cross to the other side.

235
00:52:56,007 --> 00:52:57,645
It is an apparition.

236
00:52:58,247 --> 00:53:00,317
Take courage, it is myself.

237
00:53:00,487 --> 00:53:02,364
Do not be afraid.

238
00:53:07,207 --> 00:53:11,120
Lord, if it is you, bid me
to come to you over the water.

239
00:53:25,447 --> 00:53:29,235
Why did you hesitate,
man of little faith?

240
00:53:45,287 --> 00:53:50,236
is it his coming that was foretold...

241
00:53:50,407 --> 00:53:53,444
...or are we yet waiting for
some other?

242
00:54:26,887 --> 00:54:32,166
John has sent us to ask if it is
your coming that was foretold.

243
00:54:32,327 --> 00:54:37,276
Go and tell John what your own
ears and eyes have witnessed.

244
00:54:37,447 --> 00:54:42,396
How the blind see, the lame walk,
lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear...

245
00:54:42,567 --> 00:54:47,516
...the dead are raised to life, the
poor have the gospel preached to them.

246
00:54:47,687 --> 00:54:50,997
Blessed is the man who
does not lose confidence in me.

247
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:11,199
What did you expect to see when
you went into the wilderness?

248
00:55:11,367 --> 00:55:16,646
A reed trembling in the wind?
A man clad in silk?

249
00:55:16,807 --> 00:55:20,800
You must look in kings' palaces
for men clad in silk.

250
00:55:20,967 --> 00:55:25,245
Did you go to see a prophet?
Yes, and something more.

251
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:27,836
This is the man of whom it was
written:

252
00:55:28,007 --> 00:55:31,363
I am sending before you that angel of
mine who is to prepare the way.

253
00:55:31,527 --> 00:55:35,566
God has raised up no greater son of
woman than John the Baptist.

254
00:55:36,967 --> 00:55:41,597
Yet to be least in the kingdom of
heaven is to be greater than he.

255
00:55:41,767 --> 00:55:44,156
Ever since John the Baptist's time...

256
00:55:44,327 --> 00:55:47,683
...the kingdom of heaven
has opened to force...

257
00:55:47,847 --> 00:55:51,840
...whereas all the prophets and the
law, before John's time...

258
00:55:52,007 --> 00:55:55,682
...spoke only of things
that were to come.

259
00:55:55,847 --> 00:55:59,203
He is that Elias whose coming
was prophesied.

260
00:55:59,367 --> 00:56:03,360
As fort his generation,
to what shall I compare it?

261
00:56:03,527 --> 00:56:07,520
It reminds me of those children
who complain to their companions:

262
00:56:07,687 --> 00:56:12,124
You would not dance when we
piped to you.

263
00:56:13,447 --> 00:56:17,440
John would not eat or drink,
and they say he is possessed.

264
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:20,644
The Son of Man came, ate and drank...

265
00:56:20,807 --> 00:56:24,163
...and they call him a glutton,
friend of publicans and sinners.

266
00:56:24,327 --> 00:56:27,125
It is by her own children
that wisdom is vindicated.

267
00:56:28,167 --> 00:56:32,877
Woe to you, cities where I did
miracles and you have not repented.

268
00:56:33,047 --> 00:56:36,005
If Tyre and Sidon had witnessed
such miracles...

269
00:56:36,167 --> 00:56:41,366
...they would have repented in
sackcloth and ashes long ago.

270
00:56:41,527 --> 00:56:45,202
I say it shall go less hard
with Tyre and Sidon...

271
00:56:45,367 --> 00:56:48,165
...than with you at judgement day.

272
00:56:48,327 --> 00:56:53,003
Capharnaum, do you hope to be lifted
to heaven? You shall fall low as hell.

273
00:56:56,247 --> 00:56:58,317
Can this be the Son of David?

274
00:56:58,487 --> 00:57:03,117
It is only through the power of
Beelzebub that he casts devils out.

275
00:57:19,087 --> 00:57:21,806
He who is not with me, is against me.

276
00:57:21,967 --> 00:57:25,676
There is pardon...

277
00:57:27,447 --> 00:57:31,884
...for all the other
sins and blasphemies of men...

278
00:57:32,047 --> 00:57:36,086
...but not for blasphemy
against the Holy Spirit.

279
00:57:36,247 --> 00:57:38,317
Master, may we see a sign from you?

280
00:57:38,487 --> 00:57:43,436
Wicked and unfaithful generation,
the only sign that will be given...

281
00:57:43,607 --> 00:57:46,963
...is the sign of the prophet Jonas.

282
00:57:47,127 --> 00:57:50,802
Jonas was three days and nights
in the belly of the sea-beast.

283
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:55,597
The Son of Man will be three days
and nights in the earth.

284
00:57:55,767 --> 00:58:01,683
The men of Nineveh will condemn this
generation on judgement day...

285
00:58:01,847 --> 00:58:05,522
...for they did penance to Jonas,
and a greater than Jonas is here.

286
00:58:05,687 --> 00:58:09,362
The queen of the south will
condemn this generation...

287
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:13,839
...for she came from the ends of the
earth to hear Solomon's wisdom.

288
00:58:14,007 --> 00:58:17,124
And, behold, a greater than Solomon
is here.

289
00:58:20,807 --> 00:58:24,846
Your mother and brethren are here,
looking for you.

290
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,799
When an unclean spirit...

291
00:58:30,967 --> 00:58:35,597
...leaves a man to find another
dwelling, yet finds none...

292
00:58:35,767 --> 00:58:40,397
...it says: I will go back to
my own dwelling.

293
00:58:40,567 --> 00:58:45,516
It finds it empty, neatly swept, and
It brings seven worse spirits...

294
00:58:45,687 --> 00:58:48,724
...and they enter and settle down.

295
00:58:48,887 --> 00:58:52,800
So the last state of that man
is worse than the first.

296
00:58:52,967 --> 00:58:56,403
So shall it fare with
this wicked generation.

297
00:58:56,567 --> 00:58:59,240
Your mother and brethren are here.

298
00:59:19,607 --> 00:59:22,519
Who is a mother, who are brethren,
to me?

299
00:59:43,927 --> 00:59:46,964
Here are my mother and my brethren!

300
00:59:47,127 --> 00:59:49,846
If anyone does the will of
my Father in heaven...

301
00:59:50,007 --> 00:59:52,567
...he is my brother, and sister,
and mother.

302
01:01:50,127 --> 01:01:54,325
How did he come by this wisdom,
and these strange powers?

303
01:01:56,527 --> 01:01:58,597
is his mother not Mary...

304
01:01:58,767 --> 01:02:02,760
...and his brethren James,
Joseph, Simon and Judas?

305
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:06,920
And do not his sisters live near us?

306
01:02:07,087 --> 01:02:09,362
How has all this come to him?

307
01:02:16,447 --> 01:02:18,915
is not this the carpenter's son?

308
01:02:37,207 --> 01:02:41,883
Only in his own country, his own home,
a prophet goes unhonoured.

309
01:03:09,007 --> 01:03:13,797
Master, what good must I do
to win eternal life?

310
01:03:13,967 --> 01:03:18,597
Why ask me of goodness?
God is good, and he only.

311
01:03:18,767 --> 01:03:22,237
If you want to enter into life,
keep the commandments.

312
01:03:23,607 --> 01:03:29,796
Do no murder, commit no adultery,
do not steal, bear no false witness..

313
01:03:29,967 --> 01:03:34,916
...honour your father and mother,
love your neighbour as yourself.

314
01:03:35,087 --> 01:03:37,726
I have kept these;
where am I still wanting?

315
01:03:48,527 --> 01:03:53,806
To be perfect, sell your possessions
and give to the poor...

316
01:03:53,967 --> 01:03:58,199
...so your treasure shall be
in heaven; then follow me.

317
01:04:17,647 --> 01:04:19,717
Believe me...

318
01:04:19,887 --> 01:04:24,517
...a rich man will not enter
God's kingdom easily.

319
01:04:24,687 --> 01:04:28,043
It is easier for a camel to pass
through a needle's eye...

320
01:04:28,207 --> 01:04:31,563
...than for a rich man to enter
the kingdom of heaven.

321
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:40,719
Christ, bless our children.

322
01:05:00,407 --> 01:05:03,285
Leave the Lord in peace.

323
01:05:04,047 --> 01:05:08,040
Let the children be,
do not keep them from me.

324
01:05:08,207 --> 01:05:11,244
The kingdom of heaven
belongs to such as these.

325
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:07,200
Your dance has pleased me;
I will grant whatever you wish.

326
01:09:13,207 --> 01:09:16,438
Give me the head of John the Baptist,
onadish.

327
01:09:19,167 --> 01:09:21,556
Her wish be granted.

328
01:10:11,607 --> 01:10:16,078
Let us withdraw into desert country,
to be alone.

329
01:10:19,327 --> 01:10:22,160
Come, let us cross to the other side.

330
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:47,960
Lord, give me leave to go home
and bury my father.

331
01:10:48,127 --> 01:10:51,915
Follow me, and leave the dead
to bury their dead.

332
01:10:58,887 --> 01:11:02,482
Master, I will follow you
wherever you are going.

333
01:11:04,767 --> 01:11:08,123
Foxes have holes and birds their
nesting places.

334
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:11,518
The Son of Man has nowhere
to lay his head.

335
01:11:13,367 --> 01:11:17,042
Howl, O gate; cry, O city.

336
01:11:17,207 --> 01:11:20,882
Thou, whole Palestina, art dissolved,
for a smoke shall come from the north.

337
01:11:21,047 --> 01:11:25,040
in their streets they shall
gird themselves with sackcloth.

338
01:11:25,207 --> 01:11:30,918
On the tops of their houses, and in their
streets everyone shall weep abundantly.

339
01:11:38,487 --> 01:11:41,047
Who do men say is the Son of Man?

340
01:11:41,207 --> 01:11:43,926
Some say John the Baptist.

341
01:11:44,087 --> 01:11:45,520
Others Elias.

342
01:11:45,687 --> 01:11:47,439
Others Jeremy.

343
01:11:47,607 --> 01:11:50,838
Or one of the prophets.
- What do you say that I am?

344
01:12:08,167 --> 01:12:11,443
You are the Christ, the Son
of the living God.

345
01:12:11,607 --> 01:12:14,963
Blessed are you, Simon son of Jona.

346
01:12:15,127 --> 01:12:19,279
It is not flesh and blood, it is my
Father that has revealed this to you.

347
01:12:21,527 --> 01:12:23,916
And I tell you that you are Peter.

348
01:12:24,087 --> 01:12:26,806
And it is upon this rock
that I will build my church...

349
01:12:26,967 --> 01:12:30,004
...and the gates of hell shall not
prevail against it.

350
01:12:30,167 --> 01:12:33,204
I will give you the keys
of the kingdom of heaven.

351
01:12:33,367 --> 01:12:36,723
And whatever you shall bind on earth
shall be bound in heaven.

352
01:12:36,887 --> 01:12:40,357
And whatever you shall loose on earth
shall be loosed in heaven.

353
01:12:43,287 --> 01:12:46,757
You are to tell no one
that I am the Christ.

354
01:12:54,807 --> 01:12:58,800
I must go up to Jerusalem...

355
01:12:58,967 --> 01:13:03,916
...and there, with ill-usage from the
chief priests, elders and scribes..

356
01:13:04,087 --> 01:13:06,601
...must be put to death.

357
01:13:14,407 --> 01:13:17,046
Never, Lord; no such thing
shall befall you.

358
01:13:17,207 --> 01:13:21,962
Back, Satan! For these thoughts of
yours are men's, not God's.

359
01:13:32,247 --> 01:13:34,317
If any man has a mind to
come my way...

360
01:13:34,487 --> 01:13:38,560
...let him renounce self, rake up
his cross, and follow me.

361
01:13:53,047 --> 01:13:57,996
The Son of Man is to be given
into the hands of men.

362
01:13:58,167 --> 01:14:02,285
They will put him to death, and he
will rise again on the third day.

363
01:14:31,127 --> 01:14:33,436
Who is the greatest in the
kingdom of heaven?

364
01:14:35,607 --> 01:14:38,963
Unless you become like
little children again...

365
01:14:39,127 --> 01:14:41,516
...you shall not enter
the kingdom of heaven.

366
01:14:41,687 --> 01:14:45,999
He is greatest in heaven who will
abase himself like this little child.

367
01:14:46,167 --> 01:14:49,842
He who welcomes such a child,
welcomes me.

368
01:14:50,007 --> 01:14:53,682
If anyone hurts the conscience of
one of these little ones...

369
01:14:53,847 --> 01:14:57,203
...he had better have drowned
in the sea...

370
01:14:57,367 --> 01:15:00,404
...with a mill-stone hung about
his neck.

371
01:15:00,567 --> 01:15:04,560
Woe to the world, for the hurt
done to conscience

372
01:15:04,727 --> 01:15:08,402
Such hurt must come, but woe to the
man through whom it comes.

373
01:15:08,567 --> 01:15:11,923
If your hand or foot is an occasion
of failing to you...

374
01:15:12,087 --> 01:15:14,476
...cut it off and cast it away
from you.

375
01:15:14,647 --> 01:15:18,003
Better to enter into life
crippled or lame...

376
01:15:18,167 --> 01:15:22,160
...than to have hands and feet when
you are cast into eternal fire

377
01:15:22,327 --> 01:15:27,276
If a man has a hundred sheep
and one has strayed...

378
01:15:27,447 --> 01:15:31,759
...does he not leave the ninety-nine
and go to look for the stray?

379
01:15:31,927 --> 01:15:33,997
If, by good fortune, he finds it...

380
01:15:34,167 --> 01:15:38,479
...he rejoices more over that one
than over those that did not stray.

381
01:15:38,647 --> 01:15:43,926
So it is not your Father's pleasure
that one of these little ones be lost.

382
01:15:44,087 --> 01:15:49,036
How often must I see my brother do
me wrong and still forgive him?

383
01:15:49,207 --> 01:15:51,402
As much as seven times?

384
01:15:53,687 --> 01:15:57,805
Forgive not seven wrongs,
but seventy times seven.

385
01:16:49,687 --> 01:16:52,838
Now we are going up to Jerusalem.

386
01:16:56,407 --> 01:17:02,198
The Son of Man will be given up into the
hands of the chief priests and the scribes

387
01:17:03,767 --> 01:17:06,281
Who will condemn him to death.

388
01:17:09,207 --> 01:17:13,837
And these will give him up into the
hands of the Gentiles, to be mocked...

389
01:17:14,007 --> 01:17:16,237
...scourged and crucified...

390
01:17:18,167 --> 01:17:20,965
...but on the third day
he will rise again.

391
01:17:58,007 --> 01:18:04,196
in that village you will find
tethered a she-ass and her foal.

392
01:18:04,367 --> 01:18:06,483
Go and bring them to me.

393
01:18:06,647 --> 01:18:09,036
If anyone asks...

394
01:18:09,207 --> 01:18:12,916
...say that the Lord needs them,
and he will let you have them.

395
01:19:05,527 --> 01:19:07,916
It is Jesus, son of David.

396
01:21:22,247 --> 01:21:25,523
It is written: My house
shall be a house of prayer.

397
01:21:25,687 --> 01:21:27,564
You have made it a den of thieves.

398
01:22:01,527 --> 01:22:05,315
Hosanna to the Son of David!

399
01:22:18,487 --> 01:22:20,921
Do you hear them?

400
01:22:22,327 --> 01:22:24,682
Have you never read the words:

401
01:22:24,847 --> 01:22:29,284
Thou hast made the lips of children
vocal with praise?

402
01:24:12,127 --> 01:24:14,721
Let no fruit grow on you hereafter.

403
01:24:23,007 --> 01:24:25,726
How suddenly it has withered.

404
01:24:25,887 --> 01:24:31,803
If you have faith and do not hesitate
you will be able to do more.

405
01:24:31,967 --> 01:24:36,916
If you say to this mountain:
Be cast into the sea, it will come about.

406
01:24:37,087 --> 01:24:41,524
Every gift you ask for in prayer
will be granted.

407
01:25:14,807 --> 01:25:17,685
By what authority do you do
these things?

408
01:25:18,247 --> 01:25:20,124
Who gave you this authority?

409
01:25:23,367 --> 01:25:26,404
I too have a question to ask.

410
01:25:26,567 --> 01:25:30,765
If you can answer I will tell you
what is my authority.

411
01:25:32,967 --> 01:25:38,246
Whence did John's baptism come,
from heaven or from men?

412
01:25:40,647 --> 01:25:44,640
If we tell him it was from heaven,
he will ask:

413
01:25:44,807 --> 01:25:48,482
Then why did you not believe him?

414
01:25:48,647 --> 01:25:52,959
If we say from men, we have reason
to fear the people...

415
01:25:53,127 --> 01:25:58,406
...for they all look upon John
as a prophet.

416
01:25:58,567 --> 01:26:00,319
We cannot tell.

417
01:26:00,487 --> 01:26:04,002
And you will not learn from me
of my authority.

418
01:26:06,127 --> 01:26:09,915
Tell me what you think:
A man had two sons...

419
01:26:10,087 --> 01:26:14,080
...and he asked the first to work
in his vineyard that day.

420
01:26:14,247 --> 01:26:18,559
The son refused, but relented
afterwards and went.

421
01:26:18,727 --> 01:26:22,402
He asked his second son to work
in the vineyard.

422
01:26:22,567 --> 01:26:26,446
The son said he would go,
but did not go.

423
01:26:26,607 --> 01:26:29,599
Which of the two
did his father's will?

424
01:26:29,767 --> 01:26:31,325
The second.

425
01:26:32,007 --> 01:26:36,956
The publicans and harlots are further
on the road to God's kingdom than you.

426
01:26:37,127 --> 01:26:41,120
John came among you following all due
observance, but won no belief from you.

427
01:26:41,287 --> 01:26:44,324
The publicans believed him,
and the harlots...

428
01:26:44,487 --> 01:26:47,206
...but even when you saw that...

429
01:26:47,367 --> 01:26:51,679
...you would not relent,
and believe him.

430
01:26:51,847 --> 01:26:53,917
Listen to another parable.

431
01:26:54,087 --> 01:26:57,204
A rich man planted a vineyard.

432
01:26:57,367 --> 01:27:02,236
He walled it, dug a wine-press,
and let it to vine-dressers.

433
01:27:02,407 --> 01:27:04,477
Then he went on his travels.

434
01:27:04,647 --> 01:27:09,926
At vintage-time he sent his servants
to claim its revenues.

435
01:27:10,087 --> 01:27:15,036
The vine-dressers beat his servants
killed one and stoned another.

436
01:27:15,207 --> 01:27:19,837
The man sent even more servants,
but they were used no better.

437
01:27:20,007 --> 01:27:23,682
Then he sent his son,
thinking he would be respected.

438
01:27:23,847 --> 01:27:26,884
But the vine-dressers,
seeing the man's heir...

439
01:27:27,047 --> 01:27:30,403
...thought to kill him
and seize his inheritance.

440
01:27:30,567 --> 01:27:34,082
They thrust him from the vineyard
and killed him.

441
01:27:35,087 --> 01:27:39,558
What will the man do to
those vine-dressers?

442
01:27:40,807 --> 01:27:44,800
He will bring those wretches
to a wretched end...

443
01:27:44,967 --> 01:27:49,916
...and will let the vineyard to
others who will pay him his due.

444
01:27:51,367 --> 01:27:54,404
Have you never read these words
in the scriptures:

445
01:27:54,567 --> 01:27:59,516
The stone which the builders rejected
has become the corner-stone...

446
01:27:59,687 --> 01:28:04,124
...this is the Lord's doing, and it
is marvellous in our eyes?

447
01:28:05,127 --> 01:28:10,076
I tell you the kingdom of God
will be taken away from you...

448
01:28:10,247 --> 01:28:13,922
...and given to a people which yields
the revenues that belong to it.

449
01:28:14,087 --> 01:28:17,124
When a man falls against the stone,
he will break his bones.

450
01:28:17,287 --> 01:28:20,643
When it falls on him, it will
scatter him like chaff.

451
01:28:22,967 --> 01:28:26,801
Many are called, but few are chosen.

452
01:28:55,367 --> 01:28:59,042
Master, we know well that you
are sincere...

453
01:28:59,207 --> 01:29:02,244
...and teach in all sincerity
the ways of God.

454
01:29:02,407 --> 01:29:07,686
You hold no one in awe, making no
distinction between man and man.

455
01:29:07,847 --> 01:29:13,444
Tell us, then, is it right
to pay tribute to Caesar, or not?

456
01:29:13,607 --> 01:29:15,359
Hypocrites, why test me thus?

457
01:29:15,527 --> 01:29:18,599
Show me the coinage in which
the tribute is paid.

458
01:29:22,367 --> 01:29:25,165
Whose likeness, whose name
is inscribed on it?

459
01:29:27,687 --> 01:29:32,715
Give unto Caesar what is Caesar's,
to God what is God's.

460
01:29:41,767 --> 01:29:47,683
Moses told us: If a man leaves
no children when he dies...

461
01:29:47,847 --> 01:29:51,840
...his brother shall marry the widow
by right of kinship...

462
01:29:52,007 --> 01:29:56,000
...and beget children in the
dead brother's name.

463
01:29:56,167 --> 01:30:00,797
We had seven brothers in our country,
of whom the first died...

464
01:30:00,967 --> 01:30:04,960
...a married man without issue,
bequeathing his wife to the second.

465
01:30:05,127 --> 01:30:07,846
He died, bequeathing her to
the third...

466
01:30:08,007 --> 01:30:12,956
...and finally she had been every
brother's wife, dying last of all.

467
01:30:13,127 --> 01:30:18,440
When the dead rise again, which
brother will be her husband?

468
01:30:21,447 --> 01:30:26,077
You do not understand the scriptures,
or what is the power of God.

469
01:30:27,207 --> 01:30:30,882
When the dead rise again, there is
no marrying or giving in marriage.

470
01:30:31,047 --> 01:30:34,403
They are as the angels in heaven are.

471
01:30:34,567 --> 01:30:39,846
Have you never read what God himself
said of the resurrection?

472
01:30:40,007 --> 01:30:44,762
I am the God of Abraham, of Isaac,
and of Jacob.

473
01:30:46,087 --> 01:30:48,806
Yet it is of living men, not dead men,
that he is God.

474
01:30:50,967 --> 01:30:56,724
Master, which commandment in the law
is the greatest?

475
01:30:57,287 --> 01:31:00,643
Thou shalt love the Lord thy God
with thy whole heart...

476
01:31:00,807 --> 01:31:03,526
...thy whole soul and thy whole mind.

477
01:31:03,687 --> 01:31:07,680
This is the greatest of the
commandments, and the first.

478
01:31:07,847 --> 01:31:10,236
And the second, its like:

479
01:31:10,407 --> 01:31:12,762
Thou shalt love thy neighbour
as thyself.

480
01:31:23,527 --> 01:31:27,202
The scribes and Pharisees sit
in the chair of Moses.

481
01:31:27,367 --> 01:31:30,723
Do what they tell you,
observe what they tell you...

482
01:31:30,887 --> 01:31:35,199
...but do not imitate their actions,
they do not practise what they preach.

483
01:31:35,367 --> 01:31:39,997
They bind unbearable packs
and lay them on men's shoulders.

484
01:31:40,167 --> 01:31:42,522
They will not stir a finger
to lift them.

485
01:31:45,167 --> 01:31:47,237
They act...

486
01:31:47,407 --> 01:31:52,356
...to be a mark for men's eyes,
with rich clothes and fine books.

487
01:31:52,527 --> 01:31:55,564
They love the first seats at table
and in the synagogue..

488
01:31:55,727 --> 01:31:59,402
...and salutations, and being
called Rabbi.

489
01:31:59,567 --> 01:32:02,923
You are not to claim the title of
Rabbi; you have but one Master...

490
01:32:03,087 --> 01:32:05,157
...and you are all brethren.

491
01:32:05,327 --> 01:32:09,639
Nor are you to call any man on earth
your father; you have one Father...

492
01:32:09,807 --> 01:32:11,559
...and he is in heaven.

493
01:32:11,727 --> 01:32:16,676
Nor are you to be called teachers;
you have one teacher, Christ.

494
01:32:16,847 --> 01:32:19,566
The greatest of all
is to be the servant of all.

495
01:32:19,727 --> 01:32:22,116
The man who exalts himself
will be humbled.

496
01:32:22,287 --> 01:32:24,562
The man who humbles himself
will be exalted.

497
01:32:43,087 --> 01:32:46,443
Woe upon you, scribes and Pharisees,
you hypocrites...

498
01:32:46,607 --> 01:32:49,644
...that shut the door of the kingdom
of heaven in men's faces.

499
01:32:49,807 --> 01:32:53,800
You will not enter, nor let others
enter when they would.

500
01:32:53,967 --> 01:32:57,642
Woe upon you, scribes and Pharisees,
you hypocrites...

501
01:32:57,807 --> 01:33:02,119
...that encompass sea and land
to gain a single proselyte...

502
01:33:02,287 --> 01:33:06,599
...then make him twice as worthy
of damnation as yourselves.

503
01:33:06,767 --> 01:33:09,486
Woe upon you, blind leaders, who say:

504
01:33:09,647 --> 01:33:13,322
If a man swears by the temple,
It goes for nothing.

505
01:33:13,487 --> 01:33:16,877
If he swears by the gold in
the temple, his oath stands.

506
01:33:17,047 --> 01:33:21,962
Which is greater, the gold, or the
temple that consecrates the gold?

507
01:33:22,127 --> 01:33:25,164
And again: If a man swears by
the altar, it goes for nothing.

508
01:33:25,327 --> 01:33:28,683
If he swears by the gift on the altar,
his oath stands.

509
01:33:28,847 --> 01:33:34,444
Blind fools, which is greater, the
gift, or the consecrating altar?

510
01:33:34,607 --> 01:33:39,556
A man who swears by the altar
swears by all that is on it.

511
01:33:39,727 --> 01:33:44,357
He who swears by the temple, swears
by him who has made it his dwelling.

512
01:33:44,527 --> 01:33:46,597
The man who swears by heaven...

513
01:33:46,767 --> 01:33:50,442
...swears not only by God's throne,
but by him who sits upon it.

514
01:33:50,607 --> 01:33:54,282
Woe upon you, scribes and Pharisees,
you hypocrites...

515
01:33:54,447 --> 01:33:58,440
...that will award God his tithe,
belt mint or dill or cumin...

516
01:33:58,607 --> 01:34:01,326
...and have forgotten the
weightier commandments of the law...

517
01:34:01,487 --> 01:34:05,924
...justice, mercy and honour.

518
01:34:07,247 --> 01:34:11,877
You did ill to forget one duty
while you performed the other.

519
01:34:12,047 --> 01:34:16,279
Blind leaders, that have a strainer
for the gnat, then swallow the camel.

520
01:34:54,607 --> 01:34:57,963
Woe upon you, scribes and Pharisees,
you hypocrites...

521
01:34:58,127 --> 01:35:00,846
...that scour the outward part
of a cup and dish...

522
01:35:01,007 --> 01:35:04,044
...while all within is running
with avarice and incontinence.

523
01:35:04,207 --> 01:35:06,926
Scour the inside of the cup
and dish first...

524
01:35:07,087 --> 01:35:09,806
...so that the outside, too,
may become clean.

525
01:35:09,967 --> 01:35:13,004
Woe upon you, scribes and Pharisees,
you hypocrites...

526
01:35:13,167 --> 01:35:17,479
...that are like whitened sepulchres,
fair in outward show...

527
01:35:17,647 --> 01:35:21,640
...when they are full of dead men's
bones and corruption within.

528
01:35:21,807 --> 01:35:25,800
You may seem exact over your duties,
outwardly, to men's eyes...

529
01:35:25,967 --> 01:35:29,323
...while there is nothing within
but hypocrisy and iniquity.

530
01:35:29,487 --> 01:35:32,843
Woe upon you, scribes and Pharisees,
you hypocrites...

531
01:35:33,007 --> 01:35:37,319
...that build tombs of prophets
and engrave monuments to the just.

532
01:35:37,487 --> 01:35:41,162
You say: If we had lived in
our fathers' time...

533
01:35:41,327 --> 01:35:44,364
...we would not have murdered
the prophets.

534
01:35:44,527 --> 01:35:49,476
You thus witness your ancestry;
your fathers slaughtered the prophets.

535
01:35:49,647 --> 01:35:52,241
It is for you to complete
your fathers' reckoning.

536
01:35:52,407 --> 01:35:57,925
Brood of vipers, how should you
escape from the award of hell?

537
01:35:58,087 --> 01:36:03,445
Now, behold, I am sending wise men
and prophets to preach to you.

538
01:36:03,607 --> 01:36:06,644
Some you will put to death
and crucify...

539
01:36:06,807 --> 01:36:09,844
...some you will scourge
in your synagogues...

540
01:36:10,007 --> 01:36:13,044
...and persecute them from city
to city...

541
01:36:13,207 --> 01:36:17,200
...so you will become answerable for
all the blood of just men...

542
01:36:17,367 --> 01:36:21,360
...from the blood of the just Abel
to the blood of Zacharias...

543
01:36:21,527 --> 01:36:25,315
...whom you slew between
the temple and the altar.

544
01:36:26,327 --> 01:36:30,320
Believe me, this generation shall be
held answerable for all of it.

545
01:36:30,487 --> 01:36:35,436
Jerusalem, still murdering prophets
and stoning messengers sent to you...

546
01:36:35,607 --> 01:36:38,963
...how often have I been ready
to gather your children together...

547
01:36:39,127 --> 01:36:42,164
...as a hen gathers her chickens
under her wings...

548
01:36:42,327 --> 01:36:44,522
...and you refused it.

549
01:36:45,887 --> 01:36:49,641
Behold, your house is left to you,
uninhabited.

550
01:36:51,287 --> 01:36:56,566
You shall see no more of me until
the time when you will be saying:

551
01:36:56,727 --> 01:37:00,163
Blessed is he that comes
in the name of the Lord.

552
01:37:28,407 --> 01:37:30,796
Do you see all this?

553
01:37:30,967 --> 01:37:35,404
There will not be a stone left on
another, it will all be thrown down.

554
01:37:52,727 --> 01:37:56,515
It is time to bring Jesus
into our power.

555
01:37:58,167 --> 01:38:02,922
By cunning... and put him to death.

556
01:38:19,287 --> 01:38:22,006
Not on the day of the feast...

557
01:38:22,167 --> 01:38:25,125
...or perhaps there will be
an uproar among the people.

558
01:39:57,207 --> 01:40:02,918
Why this waste? It could be sold at
great price, to give alms to the poor.

559
01:40:11,287 --> 01:40:15,997
Why do you vex the woman?
She did well to treat me so.

560
01:40:17,047 --> 01:40:21,677
You have the poor among you always;
I am not always among you.

561
01:40:21,847 --> 01:40:26,238
When she poured ointment over my body
It was to prepare me for burial.

562
01:40:27,887 --> 01:40:34,326
Wherever the gospel is preached,
this deed shall preserve her memory.

563
01:41:28,727 --> 01:41:31,878
What will you pay me for
handing him over to you?

564
01:41:36,087 --> 01:41:38,999
Thirty pieces of silver.

565
01:41:58,167 --> 01:42:03,161
Believe me, one of you
is to betray me.

566
01:42:06,287 --> 01:42:08,323
Lord, is it I?

567
01:42:09,047 --> 01:42:10,639
Lord, is it I?

568
01:42:19,927 --> 01:42:24,364
The man who has put his hand into
the dish with me will betray me.

569
01:42:30,487 --> 01:42:35,117
The Son of Man goes his way,
as the scripture foretells...

570
01:42:35,287 --> 01:42:39,599
...but woe upon that man by whom
the Son of Man is betrayed.

571
01:42:39,767 --> 01:42:43,442
Better for that man if
he had never been born.

572
01:42:43,607 --> 01:42:45,484
Master, is it I?

573
01:42:48,407 --> 01:42:50,602
Your own lips have said it.

574
01:42:56,407 --> 01:43:00,525
Take, eat, this is my body.

575
01:43:40,567 --> 01:43:42,319
Drink...

576
01:43:42,487 --> 01:43:45,843
...for this is my blood,
of the new testament...

577
01:43:46,007 --> 01:43:49,158
...shed for many, for the remission
of sins.

578
01:44:06,847 --> 01:44:11,637
I shall not drink of this fruit
of the vine again...

579
01:44:11,807 --> 01:44:16,244
...until I drink it with you, new
wine, in the kingdom of my Father.

580
01:44:25,887 --> 01:44:28,924
Tonight you will all lose courage
over me.

581
01:44:29,087 --> 01:44:31,157
For it has been written:

582
01:44:31,327 --> 01:44:35,718
I will smite the shepherd, and the
sheep of his flock will be scattered.

583
01:44:36,767 --> 01:44:40,760
But when I have risen, I will go on
before you into Galilee.

584
01:44:40,927 --> 01:44:45,557
Though all else should lose courage
over you, I never shall.

585
01:44:45,727 --> 01:44:52,280
This night, before the cock crows,
you will thrice disown me.

586
01:44:52,447 --> 01:44:56,201
I will never disown you, though
I lay down my life with you.

587
01:45:00,447 --> 01:45:03,598
Sit down here, while I go and pray.

588
01:45:16,447 --> 01:45:22,158
Peter, and you two, James and John,
come with me.

589
01:45:23,487 --> 01:45:27,480
My soul is ready to die with sorrow.

590
01:45:27,647 --> 01:45:30,480
Abide here and watch with me.

591
01:46:57,687 --> 01:47:01,805
My father, if it be possible,
let this chalice pass me by.

592
01:47:06,327 --> 01:47:10,206
Only as thy will is, not as mine is.

593
01:47:41,527 --> 01:47:46,806
Had you not strength to watch with me
even for an hour?

594
01:47:46,967 --> 01:47:50,960
Watch and pray, that you may not
enter into temptation.

595
01:47:51,127 --> 01:47:54,915
The spirit is willing enough,
but the flesh is weak

596
01:48:31,127 --> 01:48:36,406
My father, if this chalice may not
pass me by, but I must drink of it...

597
01:48:36,567 --> 01:48:39,718
...then let thy will be done.

598
01:49:03,727 --> 01:49:09,040
Put back the sword! Those who rake
the sword will perish by the sword!

599
01:49:09,207 --> 01:49:11,926
Do you doubt that if I call
upon my Father...

600
01:49:12,087 --> 01:49:17,525
..he will send more than twelve
legions of angels to my side?

601
01:49:17,687 --> 01:49:21,839
You come to arrest me with swords
and clubs, as if I were a robber.

602
01:49:22,007 --> 01:49:26,523
Yet day after day I sat teaching
in the temple...

603
01:49:26,687 --> 01:49:29,406
...and you never laid hands on me.

604
01:49:29,567 --> 01:49:33,526
Friend, on what errand have you come?

605
01:51:33,527 --> 01:51:37,202
He said: I can destroy the temple
and raise it in three days.

606
01:51:37,367 --> 01:51:40,200
I, too, heard him say those things.

607
01:51:42,167 --> 01:51:45,876
Have you no answer to make
to these accusations?

608
01:51:50,167 --> 01:51:52,237
I adjure you by the living God...

609
01:51:52,407 --> 01:51:55,444
...to tell us whether you are Christ,
the Son of God.

610
01:51:55,607 --> 01:51:57,802
Your own lips have said it.

611
01:51:59,127 --> 01:52:01,846
And you will see the Son of God
again...

612
01:52:02,007 --> 01:52:05,682
...when he is seated on the right
hand of God's power...

613
01:52:05,847 --> 01:52:11,240
...and comes on the clouds of heaven.
- He has blasphemed!

614
01:52:17,687 --> 01:52:20,520
What further need have we
of witnesses?

615
01:52:28,567 --> 01:52:31,718
You have heard his blasphemy
for yourselves.

616
01:52:33,367 --> 01:52:35,562
What is your finding?

617
01:52:38,167 --> 01:52:41,204
The penalty is death.

618
01:53:07,287 --> 01:53:09,323
You were with Jesus.

619
01:53:11,447 --> 01:53:13,642
I do not know what you mean.

620
01:53:15,287 --> 01:53:17,357
This man was with Jesus.

621
01:53:17,527 --> 01:53:19,597
I know nothing of the man.

622
01:53:19,767 --> 01:53:23,442
You are one of them;
even your speech betrays you.

623
01:53:23,607 --> 01:53:27,725
in the name of the living God,
I know nothing of the man.

624
01:55:22,967 --> 01:55:25,162
He must die.

625
01:55:27,447 --> 01:55:30,598
Give him up to Pontius Pilate.

626
01:56:04,567 --> 01:56:06,444
I have sinned...

627
01:56:09,687 --> 01:56:12,076
...in betraying innocent blood.

628
01:56:12,247 --> 01:56:14,886
What is that to us?
It concerns you only.

629
01:56:18,727 --> 01:56:23,596
It must not be put into the treasury;
It is the price of blood.

630
01:56:23,767 --> 01:56:27,123
We will use it to buy the
potter's field...

631
01:56:27,287 --> 01:56:31,599
...as a burial place for strangers;
to be known as the field of blood.

632
01:58:05,527 --> 01:58:08,360
Do you not hear the testimony
against you?

633
01:58:15,127 --> 01:58:17,197
It is the paschal feast.

634
01:58:17,367 --> 01:58:21,155
As is customary, I wish to
release a prisoner...

635
01:58:22,167 --> 01:58:25,204
...according to your choice.

636
01:58:25,367 --> 01:58:30,646
Whom shall I release? Barabbas,
or Jesus who is called Christ?

637
01:58:33,607 --> 01:58:36,075
What wrong has he done?

638
01:58:36,247 --> 01:58:38,124
Let him be crucified!

639
01:58:40,847 --> 01:58:44,396
I have no part in the death
of this innocent man.

640
01:58:44,567 --> 01:58:47,400
It concerns you only.

641
01:58:54,447 --> 01:58:58,599
His blood be upon us,
and upon our children!

642
01:59:22,327 --> 01:59:24,522
Hail, king of the Jews!

643
02:00:06,767 --> 02:00:09,565
Carry this cross!

644
02:04:29,687 --> 02:04:33,805
You will listen, but for you
there is no understanding.

645
02:04:33,967 --> 02:04:38,438
You will watch, but for you
there is no perceiving.

646
02:04:38,607 --> 02:04:41,963
The heart of this people
has become dull.

647
02:04:42,127 --> 02:04:46,166
Their ears are slow to listen,
they keep their eyes shut.

648
02:04:46,327 --> 02:04:51,276
So they may never see with those
eyes, or hear with those ears.

649
02:04:51,447 --> 02:04:54,803
My God, why hast thou forsaken me?

650
02:04:54,967 --> 02:04:58,164
He is calling upon Elias.

651
02:05:14,487 --> 02:05:18,116
Wait, let us see if Elias
is to come and save him.

652
02:10:04,607 --> 02:10:07,758
I know you have come to look
for Jesus, who was crucified.

653
02:10:07,927 --> 02:10:10,395
He is not here; he has risen,
as he told you.

654
02:10:10,567 --> 02:10:17,086
Tell his disciples you shall
have sight of him in Galilee.

655
02:10:33,007 --> 02:10:36,556
All authority in heaven and earth
has been given to me.

656
02:10:36,727 --> 02:10:40,640
Make disciples of all nations...

657
02:10:40,807 --> 02:10:45,198
...baptizing them in the name of
the Father, Son and Holy Ghost...

658
02:10:45,367 --> 02:10:48,723
...teaching them to obey all the
commandments I have given you.

659
02:10:48,887 --> 02:10:53,961
Behold, I am with you always,
unto the end of the world.
