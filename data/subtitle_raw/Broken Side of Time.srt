1
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,140
Fuck you, Jake.

2
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,420
I don't have enough money
to buy more cigarettes.

3
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,860
Shit!

4
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:27,740
He took my money.
That son of a bitch.

5
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,380
Shit.

6
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,540
John... Hi, it's Jane...

7
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,260
Sorry, yeah Dolce...

8
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,420
Yeah I'm okay, how are you?

9
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,580
Good.

10
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,340
Actually, I'm going
to be leaving town...

11
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,980
Well, I was hoping
that maybe we could set up...

12
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,140
Yeah, one last time...

13
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:49,060
Oh, I was... I was thinking
this afternoon...

14
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,260
You would? Thank you...

15
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,020
Yeah, sure that would be great...

16
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,540
Yeah, I'll see you then.

17
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,540
Yeah, right.

18
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:37,180
Hi, I saw your ad for models...

19
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,940
Nudes, yes...

20
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,140
Yes...

21
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,340
I have a lot of experience...

22
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,820
My name is Dolce...

23
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,140
Yeah...

24
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,140
Tonight...

25
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,780
Okay...

26
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,740
That's good...

27
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,100
Where are you?

28
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,020
Alright, yeah I can be there...

29
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,260
Okay, I'll see ya.

30
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,900
Hi, I just read your ad online...

31
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,860
You're looking for nude models?

32
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,340
I like that.

33
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,460
Zack! Hi, it's Dolce.

34
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,620
Jane, sorry...

35
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,300
How are you?

36
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,540
Good! Good...

37
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,220
Yeah, well, I'm good...

38
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,340
No, I am not drunk... much...

39
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,740
Shut up!
That's not why I'm calling...

40
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,700
How've you been?

41
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,220
Yeah...

42
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,140
Yeah, actually I have been...
Yeah...

43
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,900
And my equipment sucks,
but I'm working on that

44
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,300
and I'm going to make some money
and fix it...

45
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,100
Seriously...

46
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,780
Yeah!

47
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,460
In fact, I was wondering
if that job was still open?

48
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,500
I know it was a long time ago, come on!

49
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,380
You don't want to work with me anymore?

50
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:56,420
No I am, I'm coming back to Michigan...
I promise...

51
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,340
No...

52
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,740
No, I'm not going to flake out
this time...

53
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,220
Come on Zack...

54
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:11,740
Of course I want to work with you,
who else would I work with?

55
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:19,140
Okay... Yes... Yes!

56
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,060
Oh, yes I have a project...

57
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:30,060
I could send you some shots.
Thinking I could maybe make a book...

58
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,020
Alright... Yeah, I'll do that...

59
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,900
Okay...

60
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:42,940
No, soon, so... I'll be in touch?

61
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,340
Great...

62
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,620
You too...
Okay...

63
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,460
Thank you Zack...

64
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,620
Bye.

65
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,620
Alright.

66
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,420
Beautiful.

67
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,540
Beautiful, beautiful...

68
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,860
Good.

69
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,980
That was cool. Put your arm back up
on the pole there...

70
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,340
Perfect.

71
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,260
So cool.

72
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:14,900
Mom, Hi. How are you?

73
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,700
No, no, no, no, nothing's wrong.

74
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:24,620
Actually, I'm, I'm coming home...

75
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:31,020
Mom? Are you there?

76
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,820
Ma?

77
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:40,260
Yes, yes I know what that means...

78
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:47,820
No, no I haven't touched anything
in, awhile...

79
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:52,460
Yes, the booze too.

80
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,500
I even quit smoking...

81
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:04,100
No, no one's here...

82
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,500
I quit that too...

83
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,700
Why? Why?

84
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:18,380
I don't know I guess
I knew where I was headed...

85
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:26,180
Actually I have a job set up...

86
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:30,860
Yes, I think it's going to be good.

87
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,380
Something that I, I'm good at...

88
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:42,820
Yes, I have some money...
I wouldn't come home otherwise...

89
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,340
No, I won't, I wouldn't do that again...

90
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,500
How is he?

91
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,820
Well I think about him all the time...

92
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:15,980
Yeah, could you, could you tell him
that I, that I miss him,

93
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:20,220
and that I, I'm coming home...

94
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:25,140
I don't know a few weeks, or something...

95
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:36,380
Yeah, okay, sure...

96
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:41,700
No, I'm, I'm okay... I am...

97
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,300
Thanks...

98
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:53,260
So I should go
but I will see you soon...

99
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,700
Okay...

100
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,900
Bye.

101
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:46,420
Yeah?
No, let me stop you...

102
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,340
I'm done.

103
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,740
Don't ever call me again.

104
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,860
It's right there, right there...

105
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,860
Marvelous...

106
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,180
Oh, yes, yes, hold that, hold that.

107
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,300
Wonderful.

108
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,180
Yes, right there...

109
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,100
I like that one.

110
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:40,700
Do you think maybe you could
put your hand on your shoulder?

111
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:45,140
Wouldn't you rather I put my hand
somewhere else?

112
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,700
Maybe my face? My neck?

113
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,500
My breast? Maybe somewhere lower?

114
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,420
Maybe.

115
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,740
Yeah. Maybe.

116
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,540
I, I should get that.

117
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,220
Of course you should.

118
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,700
Oh my fucking God!

119
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:43,140
Bob, why didn't you tell me
Dolce was the other model?

120
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,300
I didn't think
you knew who she was.

121
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,820
Are you kidding me?
It is such an honor to meet you.

122
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:51,060
I am such a fan. You're the whole
reason I started modeling.

123
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,100
Thanks.

124
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:00,940
Dolce, if you could put your hand
on Viral's shoulder, please? Thank you...

125
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,380
Oh yeah, this one's beautiful...

126
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,420
That's amazing...

127
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,540
Perfect...

128
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,340
Yes, yes, right there.
Wonderful.

129
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:21,620
Oh, yes, yes. Perfection.

130
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,300
You have any plans?

131
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:44,180
Dinner, then drive a bit,
then get a cheap room.

132
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:51,460
- I've got a better idea. Shoot me.
- I don't think so.

133
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:55,500
Please? You're as good behind the camera
as you are in front of it.

134
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,420
Not yet.

135
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,300
So practice with me.

136
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:03,220
It would mean everything to me to have
some of your pictures in my port.

137
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,220
And I'll pose however you want.
Anything goes.

138
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,820
The craziest thing you can think of,
I'll do.

139
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:11,820
I'll pay for the room, and buy dinner...

140
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:15,460
Please, please, please, please?
Please?

141
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,700
You're a persistent little thing,
aren't you?

142
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,620
Thank you.

143
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,500
You're the best, Bob.

144
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:29,580
- I, I'll email you my favorite pictures.
- Great, thank you.

145
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,780
- See you in a few weeks?
- Oh, oh, you're leaving now?

146
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:37,460
- Dolce's going to shoot me, right?
- Sure, what the fuck.

147
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,500
That a deal?

148
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,500
Shall we?

149
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:58,540
Yeah...
We have to stop at a liquor store first.

150
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,380
If there is anything special
you'd like me to wear,

151
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,380
Bob just bought me
all these new panties...

152
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,820
- Cute, no?
- Adorable.

153
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,460
Here's mud in your eye....

154
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,860
- You sleeping with him?
- Bob?

155
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:14,100
No. Not really...

156
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,860
Okay, if you really want to know,
he likes to eat me out,

157
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,620
but that's all we've ever done...

158
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,220
I do owe him a blow job next time.

159
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:37,700
- You really do want to shoot with me?
- You have no idea.

160
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:47,860
I do sleep with a lot of them though.
I mean, it's where I meet guys.

161
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:51,500
I don't really like going out
to clubs or parties.

162
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:55,500
- You're a stay-at-home type?
- I guess.

163
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,420
The good ones always expect it,
don't they?

164
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,060
The pictures turn out better.

165
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,820
Or maybe that's in my mind...

166
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:12,340
And the bad ones, I guess I used to
feel sorry for them.

167
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,020
Go for it.

168
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,180
This guy...

169
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,220
- Bob?
- Yeah.

170
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,540
He was, I don't know.

171
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,900
Had a shoulder fetish?

172
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:38,580
Yeah. I was going to say pathetic
but, yeah.

173
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,820
He has a great tongue though.

174
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:50,900
You said you used to feel sorry
for the bad ones?

175
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:55,740
Yeah, I felt more like a therapist
with GWCs.

176
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:00,140
Like they were these really lonely guys
who couldn't get a girl no matter what,

177
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,780
and I was their one chance
to see one naked.

178
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,380
Here I'd be posing on the bed
or the floor,

179
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,380
usually naked or in a thong.

180
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:10,260
We'd be spending most of our couple hours
just talking.

181
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,220
I started to feel like an Angel of Mercy.

182
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:15,460
Like I'd be their one chance to sleep
with a really pretty girl.

183
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,660
Like I'd be making a fantasy
of their's come true,

184
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,860
they'd remember forever.

185
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,260
What changed?

186
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:28,900
Now, when I work with a GWC,
it makes me not want to model anymore.

187
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:33,020
I started realizing, it's like
they hired their own personal stripper

188
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,540
which they got to pick out online,

189
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:39,140
choose what I'm going to wear,
or not wear, how I'm going to be posed.

190
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,900
And they get to keep
these pictures forever, to jerk off to...

191
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,660
It made me feel a lot less sorry
for them.

192
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,980
Had me questioning my worth
and what I was doing with my life.

193
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:56,900
I mean don't get me wrong,
when I see my pictures its like,

194
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:00,500
'fuck, if I was a guy
I'd jerk off right now'.

195
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:04,060
I always assume most of them
jerk off to the photos, don't you?

196
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:15,420
It's just that I'd rather them not
take them with that in mind exactly...

197
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:25,940
Okay I feel like I'm saying
all the wrong things...

198
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:33,220
Do you want me to just leave?

199
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,900
I want you to take your clothes off.

200
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:03,060
The last GWC I worked with, made me pose
while watching this video

201
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:07,260
of an old black and white football game
with my clothes coming off,

202
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:10,100
as if I was getting turned on
by watching it.

203
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,980
And the whole time
he's shooting me from behind.

204
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:18,060
Telling me not to turn around, at all.

205
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:22,700
'Whatever you do, just don't turn around.'

206
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:28,660
So, here I am watching
this stupid football game, stripping,

207
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:32,060
and I can't even see the guy
who I am supposed to be posing for.

208
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,980
So, it's like really freaking weird.

209
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,660
And when I finally decide
that I am going to turn around,

210
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:40,380
sure enough he has his camera
in one hand, and his dick in the other.

211
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:44,060
And he is jerking off
while he is taking photos of me.

212
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,940
Talk about multi-tasking.

213
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,700
I know, right?
I was just so grossed out.

214
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,860
And the thing is,
he didn't even stop or anything.

215
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,860
He just kept whacking off,
telling me to turn back around,

216
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:58,780
as if I was really going
to let this situation continue.

217
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,300
So that's when I decided
right then and there,

218
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,420
no more guys with cameras.

219
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,740
Except Bob.

220
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,780
Six hundred dollars for two hours.

221
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:12,780
I spend most of my time
just rolling around in bed teasing him.

222
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:15,380
And he always has free clothes for me.

223
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:18,060
- Like the panties?
- Like the panties.

224
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,620
And he makes me cum.

225
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,940
He's a dork, but he's a keeper dork...

226
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,180
Are you really going to quit modeling?

227
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,020
I'm quitting the lifestyle.

228
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,020
What will you do?

229
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,260
I mean I've only been doing it
for a year

230
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,820
but, I can't imagine
doing anything else.

231
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:52,020
It's been over ten years for me.
It's just time to do something else.

232
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:01,620
I want you to shoot something with me
you've never shot with any other model.

233
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:04,180
Something you'd never have
the nerve to ask.

234
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:12,540
What makes you think there is something
I haven't had the nerve to ask?

235
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,020
Okay.

236
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:20,060
Well how about you
ask for what you want,

237
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:23,540
and, and I'll ask for what I want?

238
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,500
We'll see.

239
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:35,300
Aren't you going to miss the money?

240
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:43,060
Did one shoot with a photographer
who flew me to Monty Carlo for a week.

241
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,300
Made twenty five thousand dollars.

242
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:48,620
Yeah. He didn't even try
to sleep with me.

243
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:54,260
Bought my jeep the day after I got back.
Paid in cash.

244
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,460
That was a long time ago.

245
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,060
There were a couple years there
where I was averaging

246
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:05,460
eight to ten thousand dollars a month
though. So, yeah.

247
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:11,780
I average like, three grand.
Unless I'm on a road trip.

248
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,740
Then it's usually double that.

249
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,820
I'm about the same place.

250
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,020
I did a shoot a few weeks ago,

251
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:20,660
made four hundred dollars
just for washing my hair.

252
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:23,820
Yeah, I didn't even have to be nude.

253
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:27,620
Okay, that is a new one, even to me.

254
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:31,060
It's a whole site devoted to girls
just washing their hair.

255
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:34,500
I do some foot fetish work too.
That's the easiest money.

256
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:40,300
See, and I have good feet...
and great nipples, or so I've been told.

257
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:52,180
I was twelve when I first saw you.

258
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:57,500
I was playing on my older brother's
computer, clicked on Internet Explorer,

259
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:00,380
and up popped your Model Domination page.

260
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,500
Is your brother a photographer?

261
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:04,620
My brother? No.

262
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,140
He was like fourteen.

263
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:17,180
I saw you and became obsessed.
I wanted to be you.

264
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,740
All those costumes and make up.

265
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:23,260
Oh my god, the nudes of you
in those old abandoned buildings.

266
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:25,620
The way you could bend yourself in half.

267
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:29,100
I printed out all your pictures
and made a modeling book.

268
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,940
I used to practice your poses

269
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,860
so that one day I could have
a modeling book of my own...

270
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:43,820
The Pile Driver.

271
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,020
Straighten your right leg.

272
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:58,140
- Do your parents know?
- Are you kidding? Do yours?

273
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:02,700
- They found out eventually.
- How'd that turn out?

274
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:05,820
Exactly as you think.

275
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:09,020
My mom found a book
of your pictures one time.

276
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:10,660
She asked what it was.

277
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:12,980
And I told her I think that the body
is natural and beautiful

278
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:15,380
and we should be proud of who we are.

279
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:18,300
I think she was just glad
I wasn't into girls.

280
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:30,500
- I want to see you turned on.
- I am.

281
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:34,380
Not enough.

282
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:39,580
You know that grainy
black and white photo of me?

283
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:44,860
I'm writhing back on the bed.
My left arm over my head.

284
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:48,620
This is what the photographer did
to get that shot.

285
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:02,580
- Hurt me.
- Why would I want to do that?

286
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,420
'Cause I need you to.

287
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:26,940
Whatcha doin' over there?

288
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:30,180
Having breakfast.

289
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:38,380
Dolce.

290
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:43,100
Take me with you.

291
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:48,220
Even if it's only for a little while.
Like a road trip.

292
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:52,620
We'd have so much fun together.
We'd make a lot of money.

293
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:58,260
Why would I do that?

294
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:51,620
- What is your real name?
- My name is Jane.

295
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:27,060
I am here today with Dolce
and first off let me say

296
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:30,420
that it is an honor to shoot
this little interview with you.

297
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:33,380
This, as you probably know,
will go along with the photo shoot

298
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:36,020
so people can look at the pictures
and get to know you a little bit better.

299
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:37,060
Right.

300
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:39,980
So, Dolce,
what brings you to Pittsburgh?

301
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:46,820
I'm on my way home. I am driving
to Michigan, where I am from, Bay City.

302
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:49,660
And I am stopping along the way

303
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:52,500
to meet all the photographers
I've always wanted to work with,

304
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:55,260
and some of my old favorites.

305
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:58,500
This is my last blast.

306
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,660
- You're retiring.
- I am.

307
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:06,620
So, will this actually be
your last foot fetish shoot?

308
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,300
Actually, I think it will be.

309
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:13,060
I am even more honored,
and completely privileged.

310
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:14,060
Thank you.

311
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:16,460
Well, I mean, you, you're legendary

312
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:18,660
and yes, I've wanted to shoot you
for a long time.

313
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:19,580
Thank you.

314
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:22,660
Tell us a little bit about yourself.
What's your favorite food?

315
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:28,820
I love candy. So, Twizzlers...

316
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:31,500
I would say is my favorite.

317
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:34,780
But what exactly do they taste like?

318
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:38,940
It is a great mystery!

319
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:44,300
I don't know. They don't really taste
like strawberry, but I love them.

320
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:48,100
Do you Dolce,
have a favorite pair of shoes?

321
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:56,180
Well, they may not be sexy but,
my Chucks.

322
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:59,780
- Sneakers.
- Yes.

323
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:02,580
On you,
I'm sure they're completely adorable.

324
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:04,260
Thank you.

325
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:06,860
Now, are you personally into feet?

326
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:12,020
Well, I like feet, I suppose.

327
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:17,220
- Do you like having your toes sucked?
- Sure.

328
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:23,100
What about... well has a lover
ever ejaculated onto your feet?

329
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:26,700
No.

330
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:31,420
Have you ever been toe fucked?

331
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:42,180
I think that's enough... sorry.

332
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:30,580
Hey.

333
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:32,540
Hey.

334
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:41,220
Want to do some blow?

335
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:47,060
No.

336
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:55,460
- I thought you weren't...
- I changed my mind.

337
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:57,500
Okay.

338
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:45,900
Oh, shit.

339
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:12,820
No more of this... no more.

340
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:53,580
Nice.

341
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:34,620
- How you feeling?
- I feel good.

342
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:39,300
- Not good?
- I'm a little tired... But I'm good.

343
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:41,380
Oh, you are good? Okay.

344
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:46,460
Well, the photos are looking,
the images are coming out great.

345
01:07:46,620 --> 01:07:49,340
Like, you've got a great...

346
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:53,060
You're not looking tired,

347
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:56,780
you're not looking like you're ready
to be done with this.

348
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:02,940
Ever just wake up and feel like
it's time to do something else?

349
01:08:05,060 --> 01:08:09,340
Well, I went through that
for a long time.

350
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:11,300
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

351
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:17,020
I don't know if I settled in
to what I do

352
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:22,580
because I couldn't really think
of something that would make me happier,

353
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:26,460
but it's not realistically.

354
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:30,540
So, I kept doing what I do.

355
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:36,260
And I thank God everyday that I can do
what I do

356
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:38,540
because it's really not a bad job.

357
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:39,660
Yeah.

358
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:47,100
How long did it take you before
you felt comfortable doing this?

359
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:54,300
- You mean...
- Being a photographer.

360
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:56,580
Well, what kind of photographer?

361
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:58,260
Well, this kind.

362
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:02,180
Well this kind, it took a little time

363
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:05,100
because you...

364
01:09:07,740 --> 01:09:10,180
you're working
with beautiful women

365
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:16,020
who are taking their clothes off for you,
with you,

366
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:22,940
and there's a certain adjustment period,
we'll put it that way.

367
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:28,540
And so it took some time but
at the end of the day,

368
01:09:29,940 --> 01:09:36,180
you get used to it after a little while
and it's not a novelty anymore,

369
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:40,980
you realize it's part of your profession,
and part of your art

370
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:45,460
and you think of it in a completely
different element at that point.

371
01:09:46,420 --> 01:09:50,500
Only time it still seems a little bit
uncomfortable for me

372
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:54,460
is if I'm working with a brand new model
who's never done that before

373
01:09:54,620 --> 01:10:01,060
or done glamour or, artistic nude,
and you feel her awkwardness,

374
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:04,100
and it translates to me.

375
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:08,620
And I think I'm pretty good
at playing it out and you know,

376
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:13,660
acting like I'm comfortable
because obviously I need to.

377
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:18,540
But, I don't know if I answered
your question or not.

378
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:20,060
Yeah.

379
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:35,180
Beautiful.

380
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:41,900
I'm really not doing this on purpose.

381
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:56,540
Hey, Kim. Hi, it's Dolce.
How are you?

382
01:10:57,020 --> 01:11:01,500
Great. I'm confirming for Wednesday.

383
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:05,260
Right, two o'clock... Good.

384
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:08,180
Is there anything I should know?

385
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:13,980
Yeah I can stay still for a long time...

386
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:20,740
Because of your cameras. That's so cool.

387
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:24,540
Great, I'm really looking forward to it...

388
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:27,820
Excellent, I will see you soon...
Thanks.

389
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:48,620
Hi is this Anthony?
Yes, how are you? This is Dolce.

390
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:03,500
This way?

391
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:06,740
Yeah, kinda, kinda manage to get your...

392
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:08,900
I know your backbone
doesn't turn that way.

393
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:11,060
Which way do you want it to turn?

394
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:12,900
Let me try to see.

395
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:17,380
Kind of facing that way but just kind of
rotate around with your waist

396
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:19,100
and your...

397
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:43,020
I feel like the theme from the Olympics
playing for some reason.

398
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:46,020
You should be holding a discus or...

399
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:48,340
That is what I feel like actually
now that you say it.

400
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:51,020
... have a medallion of some kind
around your neck.

401
01:12:57,860 --> 01:13:00,220
So we'll kind of develop a tempo here.

402
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:08,220
Be a little more compact.

403
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:10,700
Oh, okay. Sure.

404
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:40,900
Okay, now just a little bit more
on your right... Okay, good!

405
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:43,660
Alrighty, here we go. Here we go.

406
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:45,420
Good? Excellent?

407
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:48,620
Okay John!
There you go, good, good, good!

408
01:14:50,180 --> 01:14:53,300
Good. Phyllis give me a smile.

409
01:14:55,380 --> 01:14:58,580
Okay, I need you to move over
just a little bit this way... yeah, yeah,

410
01:14:58,740 --> 01:15:02,260
now do that same feel where your hip
is on the other, yeah, yeah.

411
01:15:02,420 --> 01:15:03,700
Good. Excellent.

412
01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:05,540
Yeah. Right at me, good.

413
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:41,020
Watch as this hand tells a story.
And the shadows in the hand,

414
01:17:41,220 --> 01:17:43,580
the way they accentuate the shadows
in the background here,

415
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:46,020
it's like ink running into the hand.

416
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:49,220
You look like a painting...

417
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:55,740
Nice, you can't even tell
where you're at in it.

418
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:58,620
It's my general idea on most of them,

419
01:17:58,780 --> 01:18:01,540
is to try to make it to where
there isn't any sensuality,

420
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:03,900
it's just paint to where people look
at it

421
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:07,380
in a gallery they don't know there is
a naked person there at first.

422
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:11,100
I don't want it to be about sex,
I want it to be about art.

423
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:13,580
I mean, obviously when there is tits
in it,

424
01:18:13,740 --> 01:18:16,220
it's about sex to somebody looking at it.

425
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:25,140
- Place it all over your body.
- Okay.

426
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:27,180
Just spread it out as much as you can.

427
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:29,500
Just go ahead
and be as generous as you'd like.

428
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:33,100
Just take your hands in it as if you're
applying a lotion all over your skin.

429
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:36,540
Try to get every part of your body,
including your hair,

430
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:39,580
also be careful not to get it
in your eyes and your mouth as well.

431
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:40,820
Ah, okay.

432
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:46,700
And then once you're done with this,
then we have the ashes.

433
01:18:47,660 --> 01:18:51,740
Which the ashes are actually gently
sifted ashes from my fireplace

434
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:56,740
which were burnt I guess you want to say
burnt discards of old love letters,

435
01:18:56,900 --> 01:19:02,460
photos, and poems, and so there is
a certain, to me an emotional aspect

436
01:19:02,620 --> 01:19:06,980
with that essence of yourself that you're
going to also place all over your body.

437
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:11,860
And hopefully that will kind of guide
the emotive aspect of the shoot, so.

438
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:13,540
I love it.

439
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:17,780
In short, what we're going to be doing
is focusing on the tragic victims

440
01:19:17,940 --> 01:19:21,180
of Mt Vesuvius exploding...

441
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:24,300
- Right.
- And destroying Pompeii, Herculaneum.

442
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:27,900
And the series is not to glorify
their death,

443
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:30,700
but it's more to tribute the compassion
they had for each other

444
01:19:30,860 --> 01:19:33,140
in their final hours of life.

445
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:36,700
And so what I want you to do with
this series

446
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:41,980
is I want more of your images to kind of
try to focus on what they might have felt,

447
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:47,540
listen to the music that's playing
and listen to like,

448
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:53,540
what's inside of you as far as
the sorrow, the, the reaching out

449
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:58,060
to possibly for help or to save someone.

450
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:00,660
So I want like a lot of poses

451
01:20:00,820 --> 01:20:03,100
that are kind of a little bit
more introspective,

452
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:05,860
a little bit more internalized.

453
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:08,860
Everything is going to have a single,
what I call a divine light,

454
01:20:09,020 --> 01:20:12,580
coming down on you, and you can focus
on that if you want,

455
01:20:12,740 --> 01:20:14,500
as if reaching for the light,

456
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:18,860
or you can just kind of shield
your eyes from the light.

457
01:20:31,940 --> 01:20:35,900
My favorites? I mean for just not having
to think about it

458
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:39,500
and just going out and shooting,
would be any of the box cameras

459
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:43,540
because none of them have any kind
of aperture control, shutter speeds,

460
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:46,540
it's you just basically point it
and click it.

461
01:20:51,140 --> 01:20:53,380
Now I can't see you at all.

462
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:03,140
You do it to be more conscious
of how much sunlight you're getting in,

463
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:07,180
and that kind of thing,
but they're the easiest ones to use.

464
01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:14,740
Your leg's going to be sore
by the end of this.

465
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:17,420
Feels good actually right now.

466
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:22,300
Probably after sitting in the car
for so long.

467
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:23,860
Yeah...

468
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:30,860
I like the drive
but I'm definitely stiff.

469
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:38,980
I like driving
if I am on my way to something.

470
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:48,220
I shoot all one twenty film,
I don't shoot any thirty five millimeter,

471
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:55,180
but thirty fives, are usually kind of
like an entry point

472
01:21:55,340 --> 01:21:57,780
for getting into that kind of thing.

473
01:21:58,060 --> 01:22:00,620
A lot of these I don't even,
I have never even tried using,

474
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:03,380
because it got to the point where people
just started giving them to me

475
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:07,740
and finding them in their dad's basement,
and finding them at garage sales

476
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:11,620
and, I think I got this one,
like a week ago for like a dollar.

477
01:22:13,740 --> 01:22:16,420
And it's funny because there is still
a spool inside it,

478
01:22:16,580 --> 01:22:19,940
and a spool themselves are worth
about twenty five dollars on eBay.

479
01:22:20,660 --> 01:22:23,380
Because once I get this open
it's going to be...

480
01:22:27,260 --> 01:22:30,340
and if you could just hold still for...

481
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:36,220
and blinking doesn't matter,
don't worry about that,

482
01:22:36,380 --> 01:22:38,260
it won't even register.

483
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:40,620
You made this one?

484
01:22:40,780 --> 01:22:44,220
Yeah, this one I made
just out of a tea canister.

485
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:46,260
What's inside of it?

486
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:49,460
Just a piece of paper right now.

487
01:22:49,620 --> 01:22:51,180
A piece of photo paper

488
01:22:51,340 --> 01:22:54,100
that's just kind of like wrapped
around the interior of it.

489
01:22:55,060 --> 01:22:57,820
So I end up with like an eight by ten
paper negative

490
01:22:57,980 --> 01:23:01,820
that I contact print
to make a positive image.

491
01:23:02,740 --> 01:23:05,620
But with the pinhole,
it comes out all distorted and...

492
01:23:06,780 --> 01:23:08,340
That's incredible.

493
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:14,820
- May I look through one of these?
- Oh, sure, go right ahead.

494
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:19,580
So a lot of the brownies are,
like you hold them at waist level.

495
01:23:19,740 --> 01:23:21,100
Okay.

496
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:24,860
And so you would be looking through...

497
01:23:25,020 --> 01:23:26,740
From this position
I would look through it?

498
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:28,660
Yep, and you'd just be looking
through that,

499
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:30,220
which might be kind of difficult in here

500
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:31,660
because we don't have
a whole lot of light.

501
01:23:31,820 --> 01:23:32,900
Right.

502
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:34,540
Perfect.

503
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:50,380
The view of that light is nice.

504
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:54,140
So if I were to be shooting now,

505
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:56,300
do I have to keep it steady
the whole time?

506
01:23:56,460 --> 01:23:59,140
The shutter speed on these
is usually pretty slow.

507
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:02,220
It's like about a fifteenth
of a second to a thirtieth of a second,

508
01:24:02,380 --> 01:24:04,220
so you can't be moving a whole lot

509
01:24:04,380 --> 01:24:06,540
and your subject
can't be moving a whole lot,

510
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:12,540
but enough that you can hand hold it and
not be concerned with blurring the image.

511
01:26:24,860 --> 01:26:29,300
I've got a stereo in the other room,
I could play some music if you want.

512
01:26:30,220 --> 01:26:31,980
What kind of music do you like?

513
01:26:32,140 --> 01:26:38,020
Old punk, or the Stones maybe?
Something loud and obnoxious?

514
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:46,740
I think we've got Elton John, Billy Joel,
I've got Journey's Greatest Hits?

515
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:50,900
I think I've got some Katy Perry too
if you want.

516
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:52,780
- Don't worry about it.
- Okay.

517
01:26:52,940 --> 01:26:58,500
- I'm fine. Unless you want to hear some?
- No, I don't really listen to music.

518
01:26:58,940 --> 01:27:00,940
I never would have guessed.

519
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:04,740
- Gary?
- Alisa.

520
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:07,420
What the hell is going on in here?

521
01:27:08,460 --> 01:27:10,180
What are you doing home?

522
01:27:10,340 --> 01:27:12,940
Why is there a naked girl in my kitchen?

523
01:27:18,580 --> 01:27:21,180
What happened between you and my husband?

524
01:27:21,460 --> 01:27:22,780
Nothing.

525
01:27:22,980 --> 01:27:25,180
Did he try anything with you?

526
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:28,740
- He's not the type.
- What do you mean by that?

527
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:33,100
He just doesn't seem like the kind
of photographer who would do that.

528
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:36,980
- There's a type?
- It's not Gary.

529
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:40,060
But, how can you be sure?

530
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:43,660
For one, he never offered me a drink.

531
01:27:43,820 --> 01:27:46,540
What, you sleep with every photographer
who gives you something to drink?

532
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:52,380
No. But on occasion, one drink
will lead to two and then three...

533
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:56,540
I get it. Does it matter
if they're married?

534
01:27:57,820 --> 01:28:00,500
- Apparently not.
- I've never asked.

535
01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:03,660
That doesn't make it right.

536
01:28:14,380 --> 01:28:15,740
I think that's Gary's.

537
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:20,700
Yes. Target. On sale.
I buy all of his clothes.

538
01:28:22,860 --> 01:28:24,820
He's a goddamned accountant.

539
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:27,900
What does he need pictures
of naked girls for?

540
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:38,140
- So he can masturbate to them?
- I never ask.

541
01:28:38,820 --> 01:28:41,420
You don't ask much, do you?

542
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:44,860
Don't you want to know what
people do with your photos?

543
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:46,900
Not really.

544
01:28:47,740 --> 01:28:50,700
It's degrading.
You're degrading yourself.

545
01:28:50,860 --> 01:28:52,460
I don't find it degrading.

546
01:28:52,620 --> 01:28:54,940
Posing naked for someone else's husband?

547
01:28:55,100 --> 01:28:58,300
He is a photographer. I'm a model.

548
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:01,300
That works for you?

549
01:29:01,660 --> 01:29:03,820
I'm very proud of some
of the photographs taken of me.

550
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:07,220
How nice.
Some of the photographs taken of you.

551
01:29:07,540 --> 01:29:10,060
It depends a lot on the photographer.

552
01:29:10,420 --> 01:29:13,620
- What about Gary?
- He's a hobbyist.

553
01:29:14,780 --> 01:29:17,780
- Is he any good?
- Probably not.

554
01:29:21,380 --> 01:29:24,660
- At least you're honest.
- It's a job.

555
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:28,700
If I only pose for the best photographers,
I wouldn't be able to pay the bills.

556
01:29:28,860 --> 01:29:32,780
- So instead you take my bill money.
- Gary hired me.

557
01:29:33,820 --> 01:29:37,300
I posted a travel notice on my page
and he emailed me.

558
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:39,620
Not the other way around.

559
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:07,580
I made it out to cash.

560
01:32:33,860 --> 01:32:35,140
Hey Mom...

561
01:32:37,580 --> 01:32:40,020
What do you mean you're surprised?

562
01:32:41,620 --> 01:32:45,020
Mom, I'm serious this time.
I told you that.

563
01:32:48,380 --> 01:32:51,900
Okay, okay
I will be there in two days...

564
01:32:56,940 --> 01:32:58,500
You did?

565
01:32:59,820 --> 01:33:01,180
Thank you...

566
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:07,500
Well how's he holding up?

567
01:33:10,100 --> 01:33:11,300
Okay...

568
01:33:13,860 --> 01:33:14,900
Good...

569
01:33:15,940 --> 01:33:17,860
Yeah, I'm good...

570
01:33:23,780 --> 01:33:25,180
Alright...

571
01:33:29,140 --> 01:33:31,620
I will, see you in two days...

572
01:33:34,220 --> 01:33:35,460
Thanks...

573
01:33:36,740 --> 01:33:38,020
Bye.

574
01:35:56,820 --> 01:36:00,620
Ten years later and you're still
not locking your front door.

575
01:36:00,980 --> 01:36:04,340
Well you never know who's just going
to wonder in off the street.

576
01:36:04,580 --> 01:36:07,060
- Surprised?
- Honestly? Yeah.

577
01:36:07,740 --> 01:36:08,820
Hey.

578
01:36:10,060 --> 01:36:14,180
And I mean,
looking as sexy as ever, right?

579
01:36:15,260 --> 01:36:18,900
- Hi, I'm Fresh.
- Fresh?

580
01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:23,780
Now, Fresh is her modeling alias.
Krista, this is Jane.

581
01:36:24,100 --> 01:36:28,060
Jane is the very first model I ever shot.

582
01:36:28,380 --> 01:36:32,180
- Nice to meet you.
- Krista's just starting out.

583
01:36:32,740 --> 01:36:34,500
I remember what that's like.

584
01:36:34,660 --> 01:36:36,860
How old were you
when you first started shooting?

585
01:36:38,940 --> 01:36:41,980
We were both eighteen.

586
01:36:44,140 --> 01:36:46,620
So I was in like, first grade.

587
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:50,580
Well, let's wrap it up for today.

588
01:36:50,940 --> 01:36:53,020
We'll set up a shoot
later in the week, alright?

589
01:36:53,820 --> 01:36:55,060
Okay.

590
01:36:55,220 --> 01:36:57,060
You don't want to hang out?

591
01:36:59,900 --> 01:37:01,500
Not tonight, babe.

592
01:37:02,740 --> 01:37:04,340
You sure?

593
01:37:15,660 --> 01:37:18,260
- She's cute.
- They all are.

594
01:37:21,380 --> 01:37:25,100
- And young.
- Well, they don't get any older.

595
01:37:25,620 --> 01:37:27,260
Only we do.

596
01:37:36,620 --> 01:37:39,860
Whatever happened to that shy boy

597
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:43,900
who was afraid to ask me
to take my clothes off?

598
01:37:45,140 --> 01:37:47,300
Well, I think he grew up.

599
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:50,380
That's a shame.

600
01:38:07,220 --> 01:38:10,100
So, can I tell you about my book idea?

601
01:38:10,300 --> 01:38:15,500
- Sure, over a cold beer.
- Ah, thanks, I'm not drinking.

602
01:38:16,260 --> 01:38:20,540
Okay. Is there anything else you gave up
that I should be aware of?

603
01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:27,500
Hey, come on. I'm kidding.
I missed you.

604
01:38:40,180 --> 01:38:41,300
Great.

605
01:38:59,020 --> 01:39:00,660
Fuck you, Zack.

606
01:39:03,420 --> 01:39:07,980
- What will it be?
- Cranberry juice...that's it.

607
01:39:36,860 --> 01:39:38,420
Please, go away.

608
01:39:38,580 --> 01:39:40,100
I just wanted to see
if I could buy you a drink.

609
01:39:40,260 --> 01:39:42,860
You can't buy me a drink.
You can't buy me anything.

610
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:44,580
You can't buy me.

611
01:39:44,740 --> 01:39:47,220
Nothing is for sale in this little
perimeter around me

612
01:39:47,380 --> 01:39:49,420
I like to think of as personal space.

613
01:39:49,580 --> 01:39:51,500
You have yourself a nice evening.

614
01:39:55,860 --> 01:39:57,900
My name is Maggie Stinson.

615
01:39:58,060 --> 01:40:01,380
I'd like to thank my friend Dean
for helping me out on the bass tonight.

616
01:40:01,540 --> 01:40:03,380
We've got one more for you.

617
01:40:08,900 --> 01:40:18,460
You were so beautiful
when I was drunk.

618
01:40:20,580 --> 01:40:30,620
And I'm sure we could have been
something good if I hadn't sobered up.

619
01:40:44,380 --> 01:40:50,060
There's the door with your name on it.

620
01:40:50,660 --> 01:40:55,060
Don't let it hit your ass.

621
01:40:56,260 --> 01:41:01,900
Yes, I know we both
could have gotten lucky

622
01:41:02,060 --> 01:41:06,740
but I think I'll have to pass.

623
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:13,620
'Cause you're not my type.

624
01:41:15,460 --> 01:41:21,380
You are not the boy that I like but...

625
01:41:32,380 --> 01:41:41,660
You were so beautiful
when I was drunk.

626
01:41:43,700 --> 01:41:53,500
And I'm sure we could have been
something good if I hadn't sobered up.

627
01:42:21,020 --> 01:42:22,220
Bill.

628
01:42:23,940 --> 01:42:26,820
Could I get one
of whatever she's having?

629
01:42:34,660 --> 01:42:37,380
It's not often someone claps in here.

630
01:42:49,780 --> 01:42:52,300
- Top it off?
- No, I'm good.

631
01:42:55,940 --> 01:43:00,900
- I like the song. You write it?
- I did. Thank you.

632
01:43:01,860 --> 01:43:05,700
Don't remember hearing much
in the way of original music in Bay City.

633
01:43:05,980 --> 01:43:09,220
Usually just bad cover bands
playing Journey or Skynyrd.

634
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:12,260
- Classics.
- Exactly.

635
01:43:15,700 --> 01:43:18,580
- You from here?
- Born and raised.

636
01:43:19,100 --> 01:43:22,060
Then, I escaped
on my eighteenth birthday.

637
01:43:22,980 --> 01:43:27,140
Been back just a couple of times.
It's always a disaster.

638
01:43:27,820 --> 01:43:31,340
So, what brings you back again?

639
01:43:32,220 --> 01:43:35,940
A job. I thought.
A friend I thought.

640
01:43:36,420 --> 01:43:40,780
The need to start over,
to reconnect with my past,

641
01:43:40,940 --> 01:43:44,540
to reconnect with life,
to reconnect before it's too late.

642
01:43:44,820 --> 01:43:49,980
All of the above. None of the above...
I don't fucking know.

643
01:43:50,260 --> 01:43:52,740
It sounds like something
I'd write a song about.

644
01:43:54,100 --> 01:43:59,460
- You? You from here?
- I'm from Detroit, originally.

645
01:44:00,100 --> 01:44:01,980
Needed to get away from there,

646
01:44:02,140 --> 01:44:04,780
but still wanted to be able to visit
my family on occasion,

647
01:44:05,060 --> 01:44:08,020
followed a boy up here about a year ago,
found a job I love,

648
01:44:08,180 --> 01:44:10,700
the boy moved on, I stayed.

649
01:44:11,220 --> 01:44:13,060
I just quit a job I love.

650
01:44:13,220 --> 01:44:16,300
Oh, mine's in an animal shelter.
Where was yours?

651
01:44:28,180 --> 01:44:32,940
These are like, something you'd see
in a magazine.

652
01:44:34,660 --> 01:44:37,820
I only put the best shots
in my portfolio.

653
01:44:38,060 --> 01:44:43,900
Remember this is ten years of shooting
at a minimum of five times a week, so.

654
01:44:44,700 --> 01:44:52,060
- How old were you here?
- Ah, there? Nineteen? Maybe twenty.

655
01:44:58,820 --> 01:45:02,220
- But why would you give this up?
- The side effects.

656
01:45:03,940 --> 01:45:08,060
Warning, nude modeling
may lead to alcoholism, drug use,

657
01:45:08,220 --> 01:45:12,300
random sex with strangers to whom
you'd never give the time of day,

658
01:45:12,780 --> 01:45:17,660
disownment by family members,
sleeplessness, delusions of grandeur,

659
01:45:17,820 --> 01:45:21,180
and the inability to ever cut your hair.

660
01:45:21,700 --> 01:45:24,380
Because every fucking photographer
wants you to look

661
01:45:24,540 --> 01:45:28,300
exactly as you do in your portfolio
no matter if the photos are 10 years old.

662
01:45:37,740 --> 01:45:39,660
And I'm not getting any younger.

663
01:45:43,620 --> 01:45:47,380
But, you're beautiful.

664
01:45:49,100 --> 01:45:50,780
Thank you...

665
01:45:52,820 --> 01:45:58,540
I just don't have the energy
to compete with eighteen year olds.

666
01:46:01,020 --> 01:46:03,500
And it's changed so much
since when I started.

667
01:46:03,660 --> 01:46:07,940
I mean back then, girls were
really serious about modeling.

668
01:46:09,060 --> 01:46:13,660
If I lost out on a job to someone,
it was because they were a better model,

669
01:46:13,820 --> 01:46:18,500
and now it's like, it's like this place
where anyone with photos

670
01:46:18,660 --> 01:46:20,980
can call themselves a model.

671
01:46:21,300 --> 01:46:24,260
A place where anyone can feel beautiful,
I guess,

672
01:46:24,420 --> 01:46:28,820
but there's just so many of these girls.

673
01:46:30,100 --> 01:46:34,740
And it's to the point now
where if I lose out of a job

674
01:46:34,900 --> 01:46:39,300
to someone with a good photographer,
it's because I wouldn't sleep with them.

675
01:46:49,060 --> 01:46:52,900
What's it like, modeling nude?

676
01:46:53,300 --> 01:46:56,260
Ah, taking my clothes off
for complete strangers?

677
01:46:56,420 --> 01:47:03,020
- If you want to put it that way.
- It depends, honestly.

678
01:47:03,380 --> 01:47:11,100
Sometimes it's exciting, or funny,
or a little weird.

679
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:14,100
Or a lot weird.

680
01:47:14,260 --> 01:47:17,820
Sometimes it's boring. It depends.

681
01:47:18,020 --> 01:47:21,260
Completely on the photographer,
on the setting,

682
01:47:21,420 --> 01:47:25,820
on what I'm wearing, or not wearing,

683
01:47:27,580 --> 01:47:30,300
if there's a story
to what we're shooting.

684
01:47:30,500 --> 01:47:37,900
Some shoots are amazing, and they
make me feel like I'm six feet tall.

685
01:47:39,860 --> 01:47:42,860
Those I will remember
for the rest of my life.

686
01:47:45,540 --> 01:47:48,380
Others I feel like I'm going
through the motions,

687
01:47:48,540 --> 01:47:50,660
although I try not to do that.

688
01:47:50,820 --> 01:47:53,100
I always try to give the photographer
something,

689
01:47:53,300 --> 01:47:55,660
even if he's giving me nothing.

690
01:47:55,860 --> 01:47:58,940
Even if he's the worst sort of GWC.

691
01:48:00,940 --> 01:48:05,020
- GWC?
- Guy With Camera.

692
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:09,060
He's a hobbyist who doesn't have a clue
how to work his camera,

693
01:48:09,220 --> 01:48:12,700
but he likes the idea
of shooting naked girls.

694
01:48:18,220 --> 01:48:21,260
Can I see the photos you take now?

695
01:48:38,260 --> 01:48:43,060
It's, it's this idea I have
for a book. Interior, exterior.

696
01:48:43,580 --> 01:48:47,260
It's a shot of all the signs
from the hotels and motels

697
01:48:47,420 --> 01:48:52,460
that I've found myself in
and a shot of me, inside the room.

698
01:48:53,620 --> 01:48:57,940
Something that speaks to what's going on
in my head.

699
01:48:58,620 --> 01:49:01,660
In that place, at that moment.

700
01:49:09,420 --> 01:49:17,380
You look, so alone,
in all of these photos.

701
01:49:40,460 --> 01:49:45,820
You really are beautiful...

702
01:49:52,860 --> 01:49:55,700
And I really should get going.

703
01:49:56,380 --> 01:49:59,540
You can stay... if you want.

704
01:50:02,260 --> 01:50:05,100
- Next time.
- Next time?

705
01:50:07,220 --> 01:50:14,740
Yeah, I'm playing Friday night
at a house party... you're going to come.

706
01:50:15,180 --> 01:50:16,940
I am, huh?

707
01:50:31,420 --> 01:50:32,900
I hope so.

708
01:55:22,700 --> 01:55:27,620
I'm on the broken side of time.

709
01:55:32,700 --> 01:55:37,820
Fifteen years out of my skin,
out of my mind.

710
01:55:42,620 --> 01:55:49,020
And there's no explaining
why I went where I've been,

711
01:55:52,740 --> 01:55:59,740
except that some of us are little more
than burnt fuel on the wind.

712
01:56:02,860 --> 01:56:09,300
My first kiss was stolen,
my first love was drunk.

713
01:56:12,940 --> 01:56:17,460
I'm on my back on the ceiling
where the first pain was sunk.

714
01:56:17,620 --> 01:56:19,580
- Hi, what can I get you?
- Cranberry juice.

715
01:56:19,740 --> 01:56:20,620
Okay...

716
01:56:23,820 --> 01:56:26,380
And when I say that,

717
01:56:27,580 --> 01:56:30,660
I don't mean
that I was lifted or free,

718
01:56:33,140 --> 01:56:36,940
I was more like a dead dolphin
at the bottom of the sea.

719
01:56:37,620 --> 01:56:39,700
This place never changes, huh?

720
01:56:43,460 --> 01:56:48,300
I'm on the broken side of time.

721
01:56:53,580 --> 01:56:58,180
Out of my skin, out of my mind.

722
01:57:03,340 --> 01:57:09,980
I sing hallelujah
from the darkest of rooms.

723
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:18,060
Until the cold light of nothing
shivers and blooms.

724
01:57:23,580 --> 01:57:30,340
I don't long for forgiveness,
for you to even understand.

725
01:57:33,660 --> 01:57:38,860
In this there's no difference
between a fist and a hand.

726
01:57:43,820 --> 01:57:46,700
It had nothing to do with you,

727
01:57:48,820 --> 01:57:51,860
and the truth is that it never did.

728
01:57:53,860 --> 01:57:58,380
I've been inches from the surface
since I was a kid.

729
01:58:03,900 --> 01:58:06,540
But I'm holding my breath

730
01:58:08,940 --> 01:58:11,660
and I'm quiet and loud.

731
01:58:14,060 --> 01:58:18,860
Been on the broken side of time
afraid until now,

732
01:58:21,660 --> 01:58:23,900
afraid until now.
