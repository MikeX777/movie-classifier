I know you can't tell

Can you tell me how badly he's hurt?

to get me a date with
that guy in the first row.

Why won't you?

He's your best friend.

65

66
00:03:16,056 --> 00:03:18,106
especially when I'm in school.

67
00:03:18,106 --> 00:03:20,073
I can't remember his name.

- Oh.

69
00:03:21,757 --> 00:03:24,497
Well, Mr. Hill, just how
long have you had this, uh,

70
00:03:24,497 --> 00:03:26,267
problem with your memory.

71
00:03:26,267 --> 00:03:27,100

Um, Cindy, you

74
00:03:33,165 --> 00:03:34,720
you could go out with me

75
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,309
until I remember his name.

00:03:37,309 --> 00:03:40,638
(church bells ringing)

77
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:41,939

walked down the hallway,

82
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:48,970
I asked God to forgive
the man who shot Denny.

83
00:05:49,331 --> 00:05:52,646
I did forgive him, and that surprised me,

84
00:05:52,646 --> 00:05:55,229
that I could do it and mean it.

85
00:05:59,171 --> 00:06:00,504
Is this a dream?

86
00:06:03,826 --> 00:06:06,076
This isn't happening to me.

87
00:06:09,894 --> 00:06:13,828
- [Man] I heard Hill got it in the face.

88
00:06:13,828 --> 00:06:17,995
- [Cindy Voiceover] Oh, God
help me, I can't go in there.

89
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:24,857
Why doesn't the doctor come and tell me

90
00:06:24,857 --> 00:06:27,357
when Denny will go to surgery?

91
00:06:29,927 --> 00:06:31,286
Why do they make me wait?

92
00:06:31,286 --> 00:06:32,505
It's not fair.

00:06:32,505 --> 00:06:34,505
(sighs)

00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:40,472
Jesus,

95
00:06:41,904 --> 00:06:42,987
take my hand.

96
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:48,342
- Because you are Christians,

97
00:06:48,342 --> 00:06:52,237
and because you have great
dreams in your hearts,

98
00:06:52,237 --> 00:06:54,936
I hope you will pray together,

99
00:06:54,936 --> 00:06:56,950
and practice those disciplines

100
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,571
that will undergird your
life forever and ev--

101
00:07:00,571 --> 00:07:03,114
- Grandpa, can we watch cartoons on TV?

102
00:07:03,114 --> 00:07:04,455
- Children, come on out of here.

103
00:07:04,455 --> 00:07:06,756
Grandpa's havin' a wedding.

104
00:07:06,756 --> 00:07:07,589
- Could you guys hurry?

105
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:09,636
We're missing our favorite cartoons.

106
00:07:09,636 --> 00:07:10,469
- Hey.

107
00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:12,569
We'll hurry.

108
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:17,182
- Mister, I hope you
live happily ever after.

109
00:07:17,182 --> 00:07:19,849
(wedding music)

110
00:07:22,054 --> 00:07:25,595
- How do you like being Mrs. Hill?

111
00:07:25,595 --> 00:07:26,595
- I love it.

112
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,200
Say it again.

113
00:07:33,014 --> 00:07:34,473
- Mrs. Hill.

114
00:07:34,473 --> 00:07:36,221
(Cindy laughing)

115
00:07:36,221 --> 00:07:38,102
- Say it again.

116
00:07:38,102 --> 00:07:41,045
- (Doctor's voice) Mrs. Hill.

117
00:07:41,045 --> 00:07:41,878
Mrs. Hill.

118
00:07:44,556 --> 00:07:45,389
- Oh.

119
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:47,018
- I'm Dr. Kelsey.

120
00:07:47,018 --> 00:07:51,185
Your husband has suffered a
very, very serious brain injury.

121
00:07:52,283 --> 00:07:54,983
- Is there anything you can do?

122
00:07:54,983 --> 00:07:58,233
- Well, the fragments could be removed,

123
00:07:59,236 --> 00:08:03,403
but, uh, that would be
of doubtful benefit.

124
00:08:03,555 --> 00:08:07,224
The brain tissue has been
severely torn by one pellet

125
00:08:07,224 --> 00:08:09,886
that entered through his left eye,

126
00:08:09,886 --> 00:08:12,469
and this damage is irreparable.

127
00:08:13,415 --> 00:08:16,405
If it had hit 1/4 of an inch higher,

128
00:08:16,405 --> 00:08:18,698
it would have hit the skull,

129
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:22,365
and that's something
we could've dealt with.

130
00:08:23,505 --> 00:08:24,979
- May I see him.

131
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:25,979
- Of course.

132
00:08:34,552 --> 00:08:35,385
Mrs. Hill,

133
00:08:36,798 --> 00:08:39,683
your husband, uh, is not suffering.

134
00:08:39,683 --> 00:08:42,388
Matter of fact, he hasn't been
suffering since the injury,

135
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:45,790
because he's been in such a deep coma.

136
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,548
Now, he's not responsive,

137
00:08:48,548 --> 00:08:52,715
but I would encourage you
to go in and talk to 'im.

138
00:08:56,918 --> 00:08:58,846
(dramatic orchestral music)

139
00:08:58,846 --> 00:09:01,110
(heart monitor rhythmically beeping)

140
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:05,193
(respirator breathing regularly)

141
00:09:31,689 --> 00:09:32,522
- Lord.

142
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:36,887
I need him.

143
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,753
Our children need him.

144
00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:45,692
Please.

145
00:09:48,193 --> 00:09:49,860
We love him so much.

146
00:09:56,124 --> 00:09:57,041
I love you.

147
00:10:36,253 --> 00:10:37,170
- You know,

148
00:10:38,328 --> 00:10:39,352
people see a

149
00:10:39,352 --> 00:10:40,519
a blue uniform

150
00:10:42,858 --> 00:10:45,441
and they think we're different.

151
00:10:46,736 --> 00:10:50,736
The whole thing is that
we are, uh, we're human.

152
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:56,043
This guy is a, uh, a little boy's daddy.

153
00:10:56,043 --> 00:10:59,960
He's a guy who, uh... (crying)

154
00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:05,519
- Wayne, you know, at this very moment,

155
00:11:06,553 --> 00:11:09,220
Jesus knows exactly how we feel.

156
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,791
You wanna be alone with Denny?

157
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:17,791
I'll, um, go get you a cuppa coffee.

158
00:11:21,392 --> 00:11:24,225
(monitor rhythmically beeping)

159
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:28,392

(upbeat orchestral music)

162
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,192
- Freeze now!

163
00:12:11,192 --> 00:12:13,359
Get your hands off of him!

164
00:12:15,172 --> 00:12:17,531
(rifle being cocked)

165
00:12:17,531 --> 00:12:19,791
- Hands on the car. You!

166
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:20,624
Move it!

167
00:12:22,822 --> 00:12:25,246
Get your hands on the car.

168
00:12:25,246 --> 00:12:26,199
Step back three steps.

169
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:28,366
Step back, stretch it out!

170
00:12:29,357 --> 00:12:30,190
(police siren approaching)

171
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:34,357
You guys'll get pretty brave
when it's four against one.

172
00:12:51,074 --> 00:12:52,498
Here, hold this, will ya?

173
00:12:52,498 --> 00:12:54,748
I gotta go to the bathroom.

174
00:12:58,216 --> 00:13:00,428
- So I said to the guy, look,

175
00:13:00,428 --> 00:13:03,551
you were illegally parked,
you have to move it.

176
00:13:03,551 --> 00:13:05,768
The guy said, it's in fronta my house,

177
00:13:05,768 --> 00:13:07,992
and he wants to fight.

178
00:13:07,992 --> 00:13:11,806
- Rick, some laws certain
people don't agree with,

179
00:13:11,806 --> 00:13:15,214
so, when we try to enforce
them, we meet some resistance.

180
00:13:15,214 --> 00:13:16,265
(makes a tongue click)

181
00:13:16,265 --> 00:13:18,200
Comes with the job, pal.

182
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,499
- I musta met every creep in
town the first day on the job.

183
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:23,249
(both chuckling)

184
00:13:24,084 --> 00:13:25,084
- Hey, Rick.

185
00:13:26,377 --> 00:13:29,697
Cops don't get invited
to birthday parties.

186
00:13:29,697 --> 00:13:32,193
Most of the time that's
all you'll see as a cop,

187
00:13:32,193 --> 00:13:33,685
people at their worst.

188
00:13:33,685 --> 00:13:35,385
(shotgun being cocked)

189
00:13:35,385 --> 00:13:38,209
You'd do well to remember that.

190
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:40,142
- Boy, I sure wish they hadn't dropped

191
00:13:40,142 --> 00:13:42,267
that helicopter program.

192
00:13:42,267 --> 00:13:45,338
A guy's gotta work for
a living on the ground.

193
00:13:45,338 --> 00:13:47,271
- How you getting along
with your new partner?

194
00:13:47,271 --> 00:13:48,583
- He just got transferred.

195
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:49,854
- Oh?

196
00:13:49,854 --> 00:13:51,166
You looking for a new partner?

197
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,025
- Yup.

198
00:13:52,025 --> 00:13:52,884
I just came over to ask ya,

199
00:13:52,884 --> 00:13:55,671
if you ever thought about a two man.

200
00:13:55,671 --> 00:13:56,739
- Sure.

201
00:13:56,739 --> 00:13:58,641
Thought about it a lot.

202
00:13:58,641 --> 00:14:01,394
- You wanna team up again?

203
00:14:01,394 --> 00:14:02,917
- Sure.

204
00:14:02,917 --> 00:14:05,750
- Let's go see the watch commander.

205
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,529
- I already did.

206
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:10,036
- (laughs) What do you
mean you already did?

207
00:14:10,036 --> 00:14:14,203
- How do you think your new
partner got transferred?

208
00:14:14,441 --> 00:14:16,845
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

209
00:14:16,845 --> 00:14:19,581
(respirator breathing regularly)

210
00:14:19,581 --> 00:14:21,142
- Here's your coffee.

211
00:14:21,142 --> 00:14:21,975
- Thanks.

212
00:14:27,336 --> 00:14:30,157
- You know, you really
oughta get some rest.

213
00:14:30,157 --> 00:14:31,907
It's almost daylight.

214
00:14:34,977 --> 00:14:36,560
- Maybe I'd better.

215
00:14:42,063 --> 00:14:45,730
(dramatic orchestral music)

216
00:14:58,262 --> 00:15:01,579
(machine rhythmically clicking)

217
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:02,412
- Denny?

218
00:15:04,418 --> 00:15:06,668
I think you'll feel better,

219
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,440
knowing God will help me to handle this.

220
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,607
He'll provide for me and the children.

221
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:19,977
You prepared me quite well
for this situation, you know.

222
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:25,167
I guess what I'm trying to say is,

223
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:27,417
don't worry about us, okay?

224
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:29,961
And, anyway,

225
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:33,808
You know what?

226
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:39,506
We'll be together again in the garden.

227
00:15:40,582 --> 00:15:43,073
- I don't know what you're
saying to him, Mrs. Hill,

228
00:15:43,073 --> 00:15:46,051
but his brainwaves are
just going wild out there.

229
00:15:46,051 --> 00:15:50,218
Perhaps you could say something
a little more soothing.

230
00:15:57,881 --> 00:15:59,396
- [Cindy Voiceover] I
had prayed all afternoon

231
00:15:59,396 --> 00:16:00,563
for a miracle.

232
00:16:01,643 --> 00:16:04,255
I told God we needed Denny.

233
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,751
We love and depend on him.

234
00:16:06,751 --> 00:16:08,800
I felt the Lord say,

235
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,365
"Can't you love and depend on me?"

236
00:16:12,365 --> 00:16:13,198
I said,

237
00:16:14,042 --> 00:16:17,375
"Okay, Lord, if You want him he's Yours.

238
00:16:19,739 --> 00:16:22,322
"But, please, take care of us."

239
00:16:24,546 --> 00:16:28,603
All this Christianity
better not be a big put-on,

240
00:16:28,603 --> 00:16:30,103
because, if it is,

241
00:16:32,661 --> 00:16:34,244
I'll never make it.

242
00:16:40,086 --> 00:16:42,379
- Mrs. Hill, you're, uh,

243
00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:46,094
husband's blood pressure is almost zero.

244
00:16:46,094 --> 00:16:49,296
And there are no brainwaves now.

245
00:16:49,296 --> 00:16:50,521
Clinically he's--

246
00:16:50,521 --> 00:16:53,568
- Is there a chance that
anything could change?

247
00:16:53,568 --> 00:16:56,842
- No, I'm sorry, Mrs. Hill, none at all.

248
00:16:56,842 --> 00:16:58,938
We can leave him on
the life-support system

249
00:16:58,938 --> 00:17:01,451
for another 24 to 48 hours, if you wish.

250
00:17:01,451 --> 00:17:02,311
- No.

251
00:17:02,311 --> 00:17:03,978
- But it's really...

252
00:17:05,196 --> 00:17:08,847
- Denny and I discussed this, and, um,

253
00:17:08,847 --> 00:17:11,633
he said, if, if this ever happened,

254
00:17:11,633 --> 00:17:12,466
he, uh,

255
00:17:15,264 --> 00:17:17,129
wanted it turned off.

256
00:17:17,129 --> 00:17:18,379
(monitor making a long unbroken beep)

257
00:17:18,379 --> 00:17:21,483
- [Cindy Voiceover] Denny
knew that this could happen.

258
00:17:21,483 --> 00:17:23,695
During our seven years of marriage,

259
00:17:23,695 --> 00:17:26,319
he put me in charge of finances.

260
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,255
He always kept our
household matters in order,

261
00:17:29,255 --> 00:17:33,422
and he kept me up-to-date
on insurance matters.

262
00:17:33,888 --> 00:17:35,221
And he loved me.

263
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:40,437
(birds chirping and slow, dramatic music)

264
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,790
(Denny grunting)

265
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:46,394
- Giddy up!
- Oh.

266
00:17:46,394 --> 00:17:48,409
(Denny laughing)

267
00:17:48,409 --> 00:17:49,457
All right.

268
00:17:49,457 --> 00:17:50,994
(Denny exhaling loudly)

269
00:17:50,994 --> 00:17:54,327
(jack-in-the-box music)

270
00:17:58,073 --> 00:17:58,906
(door of jack-in-the-box flying open)

271
00:17:58,906 --> 00:18:00,696
(Denny laughing)

272
00:18:00,696 --> 00:18:03,251
(Denny making a single tongue click)

273
00:18:03,251 --> 00:18:05,437
- I love you, daddy.

274
00:18:05,437 --> 00:18:06,954
(monitor making a long unbroken beep)

275
00:18:06,954 --> 00:18:10,037
- [Cindy] And I love you, too, daddy.

276
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:17,217
(beep moving to a slightly lower pitch)

277
00:18:32,635 --> 00:18:36,026
(female vocalists singing
long, harmonious oohs)

278
00:18:36,026 --> 00:18:38,609
(Cindy crying)

279
00:19:01,355 --> 00:19:05,522
- Denny may be gone now,
but you have 200 brothers.

280
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,543
(Cindy crying)

281
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:13,003
- It means a great deal to have

282
00:19:13,003 --> 00:19:15,696
so many of you here today to honor Dennis,

283
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:16,529
especially those of you,

284
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:19,743
who were his fellow workers
on the police force.

285
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:23,446
I've thought a great about
policemen the last few days.

286
00:19:23,446 --> 00:19:26,058
I'd often hear stories
on the news of policemen,

287
00:19:26,058 --> 00:19:28,641
who had been injured or killed,

288
00:19:29,673 --> 00:19:32,673
but it was always just a story.

289
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:34,269
But now I think I'm
beginning to understand

290
00:19:34,269 --> 00:19:36,069
what it must be like for those of you,

291
00:19:36,069 --> 00:19:39,282
who are here in uniform today.

292
00:19:39,282 --> 00:19:43,023
The constant pressure, the tension,

293
00:19:43,023 --> 00:19:44,376
not knowing what that day

294
00:19:44,376 --> 00:19:48,230
or that particular assignment might hold.

295
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,210
And, if that's true for you,

296
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:53,892
how much more must it be
true for your families?

297
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:57,059
For your wives, and parents, children.

298
00:19:58,777 --> 00:20:01,703
I've gained a real
appreciation for all of you,

299
00:20:01,703 --> 00:20:05,720
and the high price you
pay to be a policeman,

300
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,553
or a policeman's wife.

301
00:20:09,621 --> 00:20:13,788
And as I thought about Dennis,
and Cindy, and all of you,

302
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:17,446
I realized that your lifestyle
is not so far removed

303
00:20:17,446 --> 00:20:19,211
from that of the Apostle Paul.

304
00:20:19,211 --> 00:20:20,482
(dramatic orchestral music)

305
00:20:20,482 --> 00:20:24,220
He also lived daily with
the possibility of death.

306
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,264
There were so many people who hated Paul,

307
00:20:26,264 --> 00:20:28,098
because of what he stood for,

308
00:20:28,098 --> 00:20:32,040
and he suffered a great deal
for the cause of Jesus Christ.

309
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,129
And, yet, in the midst of that life

310
00:20:34,129 --> 00:20:37,409
of so much suffering and uncertainty,

311
00:20:37,409 --> 00:20:40,725
Paul is able to say an amazing thing.

312
00:20:40,725 --> 00:20:43,642
He says, "For me to live is Christ,

313
00:20:44,898 --> 00:20:46,898
"for me to die is gain."

314
00:20:48,962 --> 00:20:50,552
Incredible, isn't it?

315
00:20:50,552 --> 00:20:54,076
That a man, who daily faced
the possibility of death,

316
00:20:54,076 --> 00:20:55,827
could face death,

317
00:20:55,827 --> 00:20:57,660
not just without fear,

318
00:20:58,538 --> 00:20:59,705
but with hope.

319
00:21:00,871 --> 00:21:02,665
How could that be?

320
00:21:02,665 --> 00:21:06,270
What had Paul experienced in
his life that made him able

321
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:09,937
to face death with such
triumphant sureness?

322
00:21:11,163 --> 00:21:13,491
He'd finally realized that Jesus Christ

323
00:21:13,491 --> 00:21:15,574
was who he claimed to be,

324
00:21:16,474 --> 00:21:18,233
the Son of God,

325
00:21:18,233 --> 00:21:20,497
the Savior of the world,

326
00:21:20,497 --> 00:21:23,945
and that his offer of
forgiveness and reconciliation

327
00:21:23,945 --> 00:21:26,499
with God was available to anyone,

328
00:21:26,499 --> 00:21:30,202
who would trust in Him as Lord and Savior.

329
00:21:30,202 --> 00:21:32,211
Jesus Himself said,

330
00:21:32,211 --> 00:21:34,960
"Whoever believes in me,

331
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,009
"though he were dead,

332
00:21:37,009 --> 00:21:38,676
"yet shall he live."

333
00:21:40,324 --> 00:21:41,491
So, we grieve.

334
00:21:42,739 --> 00:21:44,590
I have wept this week.

335
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,757
I imagine most of us have.

336
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,287
But we do not grieve as
those who have no hope.

337
00:21:52,299 --> 00:21:54,709
Our grief is for the many who love Dennis,

338
00:21:54,709 --> 00:21:58,070
and who've lost an important
part of their lives.

339
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:01,153
(power saw whirring)

340
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:05,622
(hammer pounding)

341
00:22:20,268 --> 00:22:22,433
- You know, Hill, I've been thinkin'.

342
00:22:22,433 --> 00:22:26,026
How can a guy be a cop and a Christian?

343
00:22:26,026 --> 00:22:30,193
- Hey, partner, police
officers are God's authority.

344
00:22:30,305 --> 00:22:31,646
Says in Romans,

345
00:22:31,646 --> 00:22:35,813
"Authorities that exist have
been established by God."

346
00:22:35,953 --> 00:22:37,346
- The Bible says that?

347
00:22:37,346 --> 00:22:38,179
- 10-4.

348
00:22:39,328 --> 00:22:40,675
- Okay.

349
00:22:40,675 --> 00:22:42,272
You know I believe in God, right?

350
00:22:42,272 --> 00:22:43,595
- Right.

351
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:45,029
- Okay.

352
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:48,599
Now, on the other hand, when
it comes right down to it,

353
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:52,766
how can a guy put his trust
in something or someone

354
00:22:52,796 --> 00:22:56,262
he can't really see, or
someone he can't touch?

355
00:22:56,262 --> 00:23:00,203
- You can believe God is,
because of what you can see.

356
00:23:00,203 --> 00:23:01,036
Creation.

357
00:23:02,554 --> 00:23:04,847
- Suppose I was real atheist,

358
00:23:04,847 --> 00:23:07,558
and said I needed more proof than that?

359
00:23:07,558 --> 00:23:09,510
- Then I'd say, "Congratulations."

360
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:12,385
- (laughing) Congratulations?

361
00:23:12,385 --> 00:23:15,252
- You've got a lot more faith than I do.

362
00:23:15,252 --> 00:23:17,000
- What do you mean?

363
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,027
- Well, you have to accept by faith,

364
00:23:20,027 --> 00:23:22,041
that everything came from nothing,

365
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:25,158
that highly intelligent,
complex forms of life

366
00:23:25,158 --> 00:23:27,618
came from absolutely nothing.

367
00:23:27,618 --> 00:23:28,640
(makes a tongue click)

368
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,311
That takes a lot more faith than I have.

369
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:34,358
- Wait a minute, Hill.

370
00:23:34,358 --> 00:23:36,441
I don't quite follow you.

371
00:23:38,091 --> 00:23:39,443
- Well, you like cars.

372
00:23:39,443 --> 00:23:41,991
How do you like my Trans Am?

373
00:23:41,991 --> 00:23:43,704
- I love it.

374
00:23:43,704 --> 00:23:46,287
- Well, where did it come from?

375
00:23:48,574 --> 00:23:49,468
I'll tell you where it came from,

376
00:23:49,468 --> 00:23:52,702
it oozed up out of the pavement.

377
00:23:52,702 --> 00:23:54,588
Couldn't happen, right?

378
00:23:54,588 --> 00:23:57,050
Well, where'd it come from?

379
00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:00,120
- All right, Detroit, they built it.

380
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,116
- A highly complex design demands what?

381
00:24:03,116 --> 00:24:04,033
A designer.

382
00:24:05,124 --> 00:24:09,072
So, it takes a lot more faith
to believe that God is not,

383
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:12,183
than to believe that God is.

384
00:24:12,183 --> 00:24:14,612
- Geesh, Hill, you come
on like you nearly know

385
00:24:14,612 --> 00:24:16,458
what you're talkin' about.

386
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:18,757
You know, you oughta put
in for police chaplain.

387
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:20,385
(both laughing)

388
00:24:20,385 --> 00:24:21,218
- Uh-Uh.

389
00:24:24,867 --> 00:24:26,347
- [Minister] Our grief is for a world

390
00:24:26,347 --> 00:24:29,347
of hatred, and violence, and murder.

391
00:24:30,376 --> 00:24:33,000
But it's not for Dennis.

392
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,327
Our grief is for the
countless men and women,

393
00:24:35,327 --> 00:24:39,463
who must face the prospect
of death and the grave,

394
00:24:39,463 --> 00:24:41,796
without hope, without Jesus.

395
00:24:44,409 --> 00:24:46,742
But Dennis is with the Lord.

396
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:51,920
That message of hope and
life beyond the grave

397
00:24:52,321 --> 00:24:55,230
comes echoing down to us today

398
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:57,406
through the Apostle Paul,

399
00:24:57,406 --> 00:25:01,052
through all those who trust in Jesus,

400
00:25:01,052 --> 00:25:03,270
through Dennis Hill,

401
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,437
that life, yes, even death

402
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:09,132
can be faced with hope and joy,

403
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:11,706
because of Jesus.

404
00:25:13,488 --> 00:25:17,409
(light but somber music)

405
00:25:17,409 --> 00:25:20,992
(motorcade driving slowly)

406
00:25:22,066 --> 00:25:24,816
(birds chirping)

407
00:25:51,024 --> 00:25:55,191
(female vocalists singing
long, harmonious oohs)

408
00:26:06,122 --> 00:26:08,670
- [Man] Present arms!

409
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:12,170
(helicopters approaching)

410
00:26:23,189 --> 00:26:26,522
(helicopters flying by)

411
00:26:29,958 --> 00:26:32,001
- [Man On Television] The
agony of war in Vietnam

412
00:26:32,001 --> 00:26:36,082
continues in the jungles, and
over the jungles of Chu Lai.

413
00:26:36,082 --> 00:26:38,898
Here the giant Hueys from
the 1st Aviation Battalion,

414
00:26:38,898 --> 00:26:41,069
1st Infantry Division, are flying

415
00:26:41,069 --> 00:26:44,006
seek-and-destroy missions day and night.

416
00:26:44,006 --> 00:26:45,664
Enemy ground fire is thick.

417
00:26:45,664 --> 00:26:47,408
Casualties have been...

418
00:26:47,408 --> 00:26:49,001
- [Man] Who distinguished himself,

419
00:26:49,001 --> 00:26:51,335
while participating in aerial flight,

420
00:26:51,335 --> 00:26:53,994
above and beyond the call of duty.

421
00:26:53,994 --> 00:26:56,362
While serving as an aircraft commander,

422
00:26:56,362 --> 00:26:59,383
a convoy was attacked near Lai Khe.

423
00:26:59,383 --> 00:27:01,708
With complete disregard
for his own safety,

424
00:27:01,708 --> 00:27:04,053
officer Hill flew dangerously low

425
00:27:04,053 --> 00:27:05,237
to enable his crew gunners

426
00:27:05,237 --> 00:27:08,123
to direct destructive fire on the enemy.

427
00:27:08,123 --> 00:27:11,199
Officer Hill served as
a flying command post

428
00:27:11,199 --> 00:27:13,489
for the direction of air and ground power.

429
00:27:13,489 --> 00:27:15,010
Due to his heroic actions,

430
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:18,330
the main thrust of the attack was crushed.

431
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:20,903
Officer Hill, it is with great pride,

432
00:27:20,903 --> 00:27:23,735
and by direction of the
President of the United States,

433
00:27:23,735 --> 00:27:26,440
that I award you the
Distinguished Flying Cross

434
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,105
for bringing credit upon yourself,

435
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:29,493
- Firing squad.
- the 1st Infantry Division...

436
00:27:29,493 --> 00:27:30,993
- [Man] Tench-hut!

437
00:27:34,191 --> 00:27:35,191
Order, arms!

438
00:27:37,397 --> 00:27:38,814
Half-right, face!

439
00:27:41,281 --> 00:27:42,114
Ready.

440
00:27:43,614 --> 00:27:44,447
Aim.

441
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:47,321
Fire.
(guns firing simultaneously)

442
00:27:47,321 --> 00:27:48,911
Aim.

443
00:27:48,911 --> 00:27:51,054
Fire.
(guns firing simultaneously)

444
00:27:51,054 --> 00:27:52,319
Aim.

445
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:53,579
Fire.
(guns firing simultaneously)

446
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:54,412
(rifle being cocked)

447
00:27:54,412 --> 00:27:56,008
- Gentlemen, you may
hear that sound at night

448
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,442
and it will scare you.

449
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:59,207
However, you may never hear this one.

450
00:27:59,207 --> 00:28:00,245
(rifle firing once)

451
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:01,860
(rifle being cocked)

452
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,590
Gentlemen, one of the biggest enemies

453
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,843
of a police officer
today is police stress.

454
00:28:05,843 --> 00:28:07,404
You must learn to deal
with these problems,

455
00:28:07,404 --> 00:28:09,778
if you're going to succeed
as a police officer.

456
00:28:09,778 --> 00:28:12,542
It can take your wife,
or it can take your life.

457
00:28:12,542 --> 00:28:15,299
First, I'd like to talk about
the Sir Galahad syndrome,

458
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:17,635
or the Wyatt Earp syndrome, if you would.

459
00:28:17,635 --> 00:28:20,224
Always looking for the bad
guy in everyone you meet.

460
00:28:20,224 --> 00:28:21,658
Always wanting to put the gun on,

461
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,249
when you go to the grocery store.

462
00:28:23,249 --> 00:28:25,350
Next, I'll talk about the
Niederhoffer syndrome,

463
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,277
which deals with police paranoia,

464
00:28:27,277 --> 00:28:29,779
paranoia to the point
that everyone you look at,

465
00:28:29,779 --> 00:28:31,173
you will think is looking at you,

466
00:28:31,173 --> 00:28:33,796
because you are a police
officer, and they want a favor.

467
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:35,439
This is simply not true.

468
00:28:35,439 --> 00:28:37,332
Next, we will talk about boredom,

469
00:28:37,332 --> 00:28:40,159
boredom to the point that
you, as a police officer,

470
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,579
will become routine in everything you do.

471
00:28:42,579 --> 00:28:45,000
Boredom to the point that 90%
of your time will be spent

472
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,583
in a police car, looking
at routine things.

473
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:50,132
You will build a false sense of security

474
00:28:50,132 --> 00:28:52,100
that everything is routine.

475
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:55,049
Believe me, a routine
call can end in tragedy.

476
00:28:55,049 --> 00:28:57,347
If it's an ambush,
they're going to get you.

477
00:28:57,347 --> 00:28:59,269
There's nothing you can do to prevent it.

478
00:28:59,269 --> 00:29:01,359
When they want you, they've got you.

479
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:04,017
- [Man] Present, arms!

480
00:29:04,017 --> 00:29:07,297
(bugle playing "Taps")

481
00:29:07,297 --> 00:29:11,130
(second bugle echoing "Taps")

482
00:29:24,259 --> 00:29:28,426
- [Cindy Voiceover] Lord,
how do I tell a four-year-old

483
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:33,435
that his daddy's not coming home anymore?

484
00:29:35,372 --> 00:29:36,205
- Honey.

485
00:29:38,095 --> 00:29:39,345
Daddy got hurt.

486
00:29:41,166 --> 00:29:42,249
Really badly.

487
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:47,110
And the doctors couldn't do anything.

488
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:47,943
So.

489
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:55,432
God

490
00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:59,798
felt it would be better,

491
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:03,215
if daddy came to live with Him in heaven.

492
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:08,263
That means he won't be
living with us anymore.

493
00:30:09,454 --> 00:30:13,621
(dramatic orchestral music with timpani)

494
00:30:28,286 --> 00:30:30,405
- [Cindy Voiceover] Without Jesus Christ

495
00:30:30,405 --> 00:30:32,488
I never could've made it.

496
00:30:33,777 --> 00:30:37,944
There was always a police car
turning around in my driveway.

497
00:30:38,665 --> 00:30:42,293
God was helping me
through his authorities.

498
00:30:42,293 --> 00:30:44,568
Whenever I needed help, He was there

499
00:30:44,568 --> 00:30:47,119
through my 200 brothers.

500
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:50,393
(cars driving by on street)

501
00:30:50,393 --> 00:30:54,393
(dry grass crunching underfoot)

502
00:30:58,619 --> 00:31:01,369
(birds chirping)

503
00:31:24,814 --> 00:31:28,777
(cars driving on busy street)

504
00:31:28,777 --> 00:31:32,944
(emergency vehicle siren approaching)

505
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:44,853
(dramatic orchestral music)

506
00:31:44,853 --> 00:31:46,444
- Police! Freeze, mister!

507
00:31:46,444 --> 00:31:47,335
(two gunshots firing)

508
00:31:47,335 --> 00:31:48,535
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

509
00:31:48,535 --> 00:31:51,952
(rifle hitting pavement)

510
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,382
- [Denny] Put your hands behind your head.

511
00:32:00,382 --> 00:32:02,882
- [Wayne] Fingers interlocked.

512
00:32:44,133 --> 00:32:47,158
- Look, the guy tried to shoot me.

513
00:32:47,158 --> 00:32:48,795
Didja hear me?

514
00:32:48,795 --> 00:32:49,628
He tried to shoot me,

515
00:32:49,628 --> 00:32:51,163
and I took his gun away
from him, and shot him.

516
00:32:51,163 --> 00:32:52,980
It was nothin' but self-defense.

517
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:56,260
(handcuffs clicking closed)

518
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,775
It's self-defense, that's all it was.

519
00:32:57,775 --> 00:32:59,331
I got a right to protect myself.

520
00:32:59,331 --> 00:33:01,125
(handcuff clicking closed)

521
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:02,390
- Let's go.

522
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:03,815
- I said it was, look, the guy,

523
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,141
he's comin' out with a shotgun,

524
00:33:05,141 --> 00:33:05,974
and I took it away from him,

525
00:33:05,974 --> 00:33:06,981
and shot him with it!

526
00:33:06,981 --> 00:33:09,650
At least I got a right to
protect myself, don't I?

527
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:11,339
You can't arrest me for protecting myself.

528
00:33:11,339 --> 00:33:13,476
It's just self-defense.

529
00:33:13,476 --> 00:33:15,084
You guys are all the same.

530
00:33:15,084 --> 00:33:18,334
I didn't do anything, it was his fault.

531
00:33:19,525 --> 00:33:23,442
(car approaching and stopping)

532
00:33:27,843 --> 00:33:29,346
- Is everything under control?

533
00:33:29,346 --> 00:33:31,390
- Would you call Fire Rescue?

534
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:33,706
- Look, that guy shot at me
first, and I just shot back.

535
00:33:33,706 --> 00:33:35,291
I got a right to protect myself.

536
00:33:35,291 --> 00:33:36,968
- He's tellin' the truth, officer.

537
00:33:36,968 --> 00:33:40,480
Some guy up there fired
three, four shots at this man.

538
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,313
- Who are you?

539
00:33:41,313 --> 00:33:43,547
- Dale Lear, I'm assistant manager here.

540
00:33:43,547 --> 00:33:44,859
- If you were shooting in self-defense,

541
00:33:44,859 --> 00:33:46,815
then why'd you turn the gun on us?

542
00:33:46,815 --> 00:33:49,996
- That guy said he was cops
and started shooting at me.

543
00:33:49,996 --> 00:33:52,246
I got confused and excited.

544
00:33:54,379 --> 00:33:57,769
- [Denny] How long since you've
been to the firing range?

545
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:01,936
- [Wayne] I was gonna ask
you the same question.

546
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:04,816
- [Denny] You know, they're
going to ask us why we missed.

547
00:34:04,816 --> 00:34:06,366
- [Wayne] Yes.

548
00:34:06,366 --> 00:34:08,116
Lucky for him we did.

549
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:10,580
- Hmmph.

550
00:34:12,661 --> 00:34:16,498
- You think God had
something to do with that?

551
00:34:16,498 --> 00:34:18,669
- I didn't say anything.

552
00:34:18,669 --> 00:34:19,732
- Why do you think it was God,

553
00:34:19,732 --> 00:34:22,385
and not just the fact
that we were lousy shots.

554
00:34:22,385 --> 00:34:26,338
- Well, for one thing,
we're not lousy shots.

555
00:34:26,338 --> 00:34:28,126
- It's kinda weird, isn't it?

556
00:34:28,126 --> 00:34:32,293
I mean, if we'd have hit 'im,
we'd have hit the wrong guy.

557
00:34:32,712 --> 00:34:33,629
- Question.

558
00:34:34,709 --> 00:34:38,876
Suppose he had opened up on
us, and we'd bought the farm?

559
00:34:39,135 --> 00:34:39,968
- Coulda happened.

560
00:34:39,968 --> 00:34:41,915
- I know it coulda happened.

561
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:43,634
- What's the question?

562
00:34:43,634 --> 00:34:47,051
- Do you know where you'd spend eternity?

563
00:34:50,692 --> 00:34:52,971
And be honest now.

564
00:34:52,971 --> 00:34:54,572
- Well, in heaven, I hope.

565
00:34:54,572 --> 00:34:55,849
- But you're not sure.

566
00:34:55,849 --> 00:34:56,682
- Are you?

567
00:34:57,568 --> 00:34:58,651
- Absolutely.

568
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:03,898
- [Wayne] Well, I guess I
don't really know for sure.

569
00:35:03,898 --> 00:35:07,231
- [Denny] Something to think about, huh?

570
00:35:16,663 --> 00:35:18,846
- [Dispatcher On Radio] One-35.

571
00:35:18,846 --> 00:35:20,320
- One-35.

572
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,645
- [Dispatcher On Radio]
One-35, 1330 South Bettencourt,

573
00:35:23,645 --> 00:35:26,623
1330 South Bettencourt, resusce and care,

574
00:35:26,623 --> 00:35:28,955
child swallowed unknown substance.

575
00:35:28,955 --> 00:35:30,762
Rescue's en route.

576
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:31,788
- 10-4.

577
00:35:31,788 --> 00:35:34,538
- 10-4, 10-17, KV-Two-60 and out.

578
00:35:36,544 --> 00:35:39,377
(engine starting)

579
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:47,109
(tires squealing)

580
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:51,023
- [Wayne] Emergency comin'
in, emergency goin' out.

581
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:55,190
(emergency vehicle siren wailing)

582
00:36:11,104 --> 00:36:13,354
Oh, no, now we got trouble.

583
00:36:14,431 --> 00:36:18,098
(dramatic orchestral music)

584
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:22,442
- [Denny] I'm gonna swing a right.

585
00:36:22,442 --> 00:36:25,275
- [Wayne] We just lost 10 minutes.

586
00:36:26,265 --> 00:36:27,818
If we can somehow get through to Hubbell,

587
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:30,985
we can get at least five minutes back.

588
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:35,869
(tires screeching to a halt)

589
00:36:41,742 --> 00:36:43,384
- Listen, we gotta get to Hubbell.

590
00:36:43,384 --> 00:36:44,483
A boy's life is at stake.

591
00:36:44,483 --> 00:36:46,250
Can you get us through here?

592
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,083
- Yeah.

593
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:56,663
(starter cranking)

594
00:36:56,663 --> 00:36:59,996
(diesel engine revving)

595
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:07,893
- One-35.

596
00:37:09,008 --> 00:37:10,314
- [Dispatcher On Radio] One-35.

597
00:37:10,314 --> 00:37:13,189
- We're on East 46th, East 46th,

598
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,163
cutting through field to Hubbell.

599
00:37:15,163 --> 00:37:18,298
You might advise Rescue
that East 9th is blocked.

600
00:37:18,298 --> 00:37:19,785
Come down East 46th.

601
00:37:19,785 --> 00:37:22,081
The path bulldozed to Hubbell will cut ETA

602
00:37:22,081 --> 00:37:24,199
to 1330 Bettencourt.

603
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:26,754
(dead branches being moved and crushed)

604
00:37:26,754 --> 00:37:29,171
- [Dispatcher On Radio] 10-4.

605
00:37:44,231 --> 00:37:47,239
(heavy metal-on-metal thud)

606
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:51,406
(emergency vehicle siren wailing)

607
00:37:55,996 --> 00:37:57,653
(birds chirping)

608
00:37:57,653 --> 00:38:01,320
(dramatic orchestral music)

609
00:38:07,717 --> 00:38:10,467
(light thumping)

610
00:38:20,636 --> 00:38:21,961
- Ah, ah, ah.

611
00:38:21,961 --> 00:38:23,209
Now lie still.

612
00:38:23,209 --> 00:38:24,697
- [Wayne] Oh, ho, ho.

613
00:38:24,697 --> 00:38:25,955
- Lie still.

614
00:38:25,955 --> 00:38:30,122
(emergency vehicle siren approaching)

615
00:38:30,487 --> 00:38:33,487
(car doors closing)

616
00:38:37,985 --> 00:38:39,746
- How's he doin' now?

617
00:38:39,746 --> 00:38:41,446
Feel better?

618
00:38:41,446 --> 00:38:45,613
(conversation obscured
by diesel engine running)

619
00:38:56,427 --> 00:38:58,950
- Thank God the button
had four holes in it.

620
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,556
Gave him just enough air to keep him alive

621
00:39:00,556 --> 00:39:02,056
until we got here.

622
00:39:04,686 --> 00:39:06,526
- [Cindy Voiceover] Denny
had been asking himself,

623
00:39:06,526 --> 00:39:09,810
was being a cop really worth it?

624
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:12,468
He said God had given him his answer,

625
00:39:12,468 --> 00:39:13,301
but, of course,

626
00:39:13,301 --> 00:39:17,191
it wasn't long until Satan
tried to discourage him again.

627
00:39:17,191 --> 00:39:19,858
- You filthy, dirty rotten pigs.

628
00:39:20,979 --> 00:39:23,041
- Well, at least we know one little boy,

629
00:39:23,041 --> 00:39:27,208
who's not gonna grow
up with that attitude.

630
00:39:27,306 --> 00:39:28,766
(Denny sighing heavily)

631
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:31,849
(blow dryer running)

632
00:39:39,534 --> 00:39:40,996
(blow dryer stops running)

633
00:39:40,996 --> 00:39:44,746
- Dennis Hill, I don't
understand you at all.

634
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:52,844
- You know, there's a name for that.

635
00:39:52,844 --> 00:39:54,124
- What is it?

636
00:39:54,124 --> 00:39:56,104
- Dirty, rotten pig.

637
00:39:56,104 --> 00:39:56,937
- Well.

638
00:39:59,414 --> 00:40:02,922
You're spoiled rotten, that's for sure.

639
00:40:02,922 --> 00:40:07,089
Denny, you're the most
organized guy in the world.

640
00:40:07,212 --> 00:40:10,393
Your car will probably
never see a speck of dirt.

641
00:40:10,393 --> 00:40:12,699
You hang up your clothes,
shine your shoes.

642
00:40:12,699 --> 00:40:16,866
Your closet is ready for a
military inspection at all times.

643
00:40:19,011 --> 00:40:19,844
But, why,

644
00:40:21,441 --> 00:40:23,587
do you always throw your underwear

645
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,670
behind the bathroom door?

646
00:40:28,415 --> 00:40:30,498
- Well, I can explain it.

647
00:40:32,162 --> 00:40:34,705
If I did everything right,
then I'd be perfect.

648
00:40:34,705 --> 00:40:35,803
Then all the women in the world,

649
00:40:35,803 --> 00:40:37,430
who are looking for perfect husbands,

650
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:38,907
would be after me,

651
00:40:38,907 --> 00:40:41,617
and that would make you most unhappy.

652
00:40:41,617 --> 00:40:43,689
So, I, uh, throw my underwear

653
00:40:43,689 --> 00:40:46,073
behind the bathroom door for two reasons.

654
00:40:46,073 --> 00:40:48,176
One, so I won't be perfect.

655
00:40:48,176 --> 00:40:50,426
And two, to make you happy.

656
00:40:54,874 --> 00:40:55,874
- Smart cop.

657
00:40:57,664 --> 00:41:00,247
- Mmm. You're a beautiful lady.

658
00:41:01,939 --> 00:41:04,939
(power saw whining)

659
00:41:09,192 --> 00:41:11,782
(saw turning off)

660
00:41:11,782 --> 00:41:12,865
- Ah, thanks.

661
00:41:18,223 --> 00:41:19,056
Phew.

662
00:41:19,947 --> 00:41:21,317
You know, you asked me a coupla weeks ago

663
00:41:21,317 --> 00:41:24,130
where I'd spend eternity, if I died.

664
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:25,982
- Oh, you've been thinking about it, huh?

665
00:41:25,982 --> 00:41:28,068
- I can't stop thinking about it.

666
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,182
- Good.

667
00:41:29,182 --> 00:41:30,690
- You know, the only thing is,

668
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:33,363
how come you think I'm such a sinner?

669
00:41:33,363 --> 00:41:34,670
I'm good to my family.

670
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:36,233
I fought in Nam.

671
00:41:36,233 --> 00:41:37,876
Man, I don't even drink.

672
00:41:37,876 --> 00:41:38,856
- You cuss.

673
00:41:38,856 --> 00:41:40,623
- Yeah, but only when I'm mad.

674
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:43,399
(both laughing)

675
00:41:43,399 --> 00:41:44,232
- Well,

676
00:41:45,445 --> 00:41:47,943
I'm a sinner, too, ya know.

677
00:41:47,943 --> 00:41:49,918
- Shoot, I never even heard you cuss

678
00:41:49,918 --> 00:41:51,782
or saw you take a drink.

679
00:41:51,782 --> 00:41:54,203
- There's a lot more to
sin than those things.

680
00:41:54,203 --> 00:41:55,866
It's pride.

681
00:41:55,866 --> 00:41:57,690
It's all kinds of things.

682
00:41:57,690 --> 00:41:59,773
But my sins are forgiven,

683
00:42:00,779 --> 00:42:04,091
because Christ died on a cross.

684
00:42:04,091 --> 00:42:08,258
What in your estimation
is the world's worst sin.

685
00:42:08,701 --> 00:42:09,534
- Murder.

686
00:42:11,475 --> 00:42:12,308
- Come on.

687
00:42:13,557 --> 00:42:15,724
Let me show you something.

688
00:42:16,921 --> 00:42:19,532
You know, doing good deeds,
and being a good guy,

689
00:42:19,532 --> 00:42:21,962
won't get you into heaven.

690
00:42:21,962 --> 00:42:25,852
Unless you receive Christ
as your personal Savior,

691
00:42:25,852 --> 00:42:28,098
you will not spend eternity in heaven.

692
00:42:28,098 --> 00:42:30,435
- You know, I think I've
come a long ways, Denny,

693
00:42:30,435 --> 00:42:32,280
since you and I started talking about this

694
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,823
back in the flying days.

695
00:42:34,823 --> 00:42:38,818
The only thing is, how come
I'm still not buying this?

696
00:42:38,818 --> 00:42:41,304
- Because you're a typical, cynical cop.

697
00:42:41,304 --> 00:42:42,563
You have a sick syndrome.

698
00:42:42,563 --> 00:42:43,916
(both laughing)

699
00:42:43,916 --> 00:42:45,583
Matthew, chapter 22,

700
00:42:46,517 --> 00:42:47,910
37.

701
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:51,091
"Thou shall love the Lord,
thy God, with all thy heart,

702
00:42:51,091 --> 00:42:54,651
"and with all thy soul,
and with all thy mind."

703
00:42:54,651 --> 00:42:57,697
That's the first and greatest commandment.

704
00:42:57,697 --> 00:43:00,713
So, what's the first and greatest sin?

705
00:43:00,713 --> 00:43:04,112
Not to put God first in everything.

706
00:43:04,112 --> 00:43:08,279
- You mean I should put
God ahead of my family?

707
00:43:08,542 --> 00:43:10,127
- How important is your family to you?

708
00:43:10,127 --> 00:43:12,065
- You know how important they are to me.

709
00:43:12,065 --> 00:43:13,728
- So does God.

710
00:43:13,728 --> 00:43:16,329
And He's even more concerned
about them than you are.

711
00:43:16,329 --> 00:43:17,733
So, if you put God first,

712
00:43:17,733 --> 00:43:19,997
He will help you take proper care of them,

713
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:21,883
to help you raise your kids,

714
00:43:21,883 --> 00:43:23,966
make the right decisions.

715
00:43:28,849 --> 00:43:31,287
Do you believe that Christ existed.

716
00:43:31,287 --> 00:43:33,266
- Oh, sure, I believe that.

717
00:43:33,266 --> 00:43:36,868
Well, he was a carpenter and a teacher.

718
00:43:36,868 --> 00:43:38,815
That's, I've always wondered about that.

719
00:43:38,815 --> 00:43:42,462
Why was he a carpenter
instead of, instead of a cop?

720
00:43:42,462 --> 00:43:44,746
- Well, he is a cop.

721
00:43:44,746 --> 00:43:46,475
He's a chief of police.

722
00:43:46,475 --> 00:43:47,676
And, if you remember the scripture

723
00:43:47,676 --> 00:43:49,961
we were talking about before from Romans,

724
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:52,512
we are His police force,
we are His authority,

725
00:43:52,512 --> 00:43:55,476
and we should take our
instructions from Him.

726
00:43:55,476 --> 00:43:58,871
You know, He still is a carpenter.

727
00:43:58,871 --> 00:44:01,213
He helps to build lives into a purpose,

728
00:44:01,213 --> 00:44:03,463
not just into an existence.

729
00:44:12,678 --> 00:44:14,413
- How you doin'?

730
00:44:14,413 --> 00:44:16,693
- The little, the little boy?

731
00:44:16,693 --> 00:44:19,450
- The little boy is fine, thanks to you.

732
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:21,972
A lot of people wouldn't
have gotten involved.

733
00:44:21,972 --> 00:44:24,352
- You helped save his life.

734
00:44:24,352 --> 00:44:25,185
- I know.

735
00:44:26,103 --> 00:44:30,103
But, you see, what I
didn't know, the other day,

736
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:34,343
when I helped you,

737
00:44:34,343 --> 00:44:35,176
you see,

738
00:44:36,877 --> 00:44:40,228
well, that was, that was my son.

739
00:44:40,228 --> 00:44:43,728
(somber orchestral music)

740
00:44:47,798 --> 00:44:48,631
Thank you.

741
00:44:49,801 --> 00:44:52,968

00:45:28,805 --> 00:45:29,638

755
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:53,204
(police radio chatter under music)

756
00:46:00,473 --> 00:46:01,306
Psalm 19.

757
00:46:02,959 --> 00:46:04,167
Whew.

758
00:46:04,167 --> 00:46:06,750
This is worse than Shakespeare.

759
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:15,019
(Denny whistling a song)

760
00:46:18,167 --> 00:46:21,750
(intense orchestral music)

761
00:46:24,461 --> 00:46:26,632
Have you noticed that gas-station holdups

762
00:46:26,632 --> 00:46:28,736
on our beat are at an all-time low?

763
00:46:28,736 --> 00:46:29,886
- Really?

764
00:46:29,886 --> 00:46:31,067
- Well, sure.

765
00:46:31,067 --> 00:46:35,234
Every time a guy goes to rob
one, there's a cop in the can.

766
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:38,626
(both laughing)

767
00:46:40,202 --> 00:46:44,124
Ah, listen, what do you
know about Psalm 19?

(tires screeching, pavement scraping)

771
00:47:21,314 --> 00:47:22,731
That guy's crazy.

781
00:47:42,563 --> 00:47:44,583
Send Rescue at this time.

782
00:47:44,583 --> 00:47:45,780
Attention all units.

783
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:49,039

(tires screeching to a halt)

794
00:48:31,773 --> 00:48:33,660
- Lunders, you and Hill
go to back to 107 Norwalk,

795
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:37,827
and see if you can do somethin'
'til Rescue gets there.

(woman crying)

800
00:49:44,541 --> 00:49:47,556
- If you guys would spend more
time enforcing speeding laws,

801
00:49:47,556 --> 00:49:49,188
instead of writing parking tickets,

802
00:49:49,188 --> 00:49:52,521
maybe our kids'd be safe on the streets.

803
00:49:54,821 --> 00:49:56,464
- Did anyone see this happen?

804
00:49:56,464 --> 00:49:57,297
- I did.

805
00:49:58,298 --> 00:50:00,536
Eric lost his ball, and the
ball went out in the street,

806
00:50:00,536 --> 00:50:01,794
and he went out to get it,

807
00:50:01,794 --> 00:50:04,051
and this crazy, wild man
came down the street,

808
00:50:04,051 --> 00:50:06,696
about 30, 40, 50 miles
an hour, and he hit 'im,

809
00:50:06,696 --> 00:50:09,113
and he didn't even slow down.

810
00:50:13,697 --> 00:50:16,299
- Can you tell me how many
occupants were in the vehicle?

811
00:50:16,299 --> 00:50:17,211
- One. I th--

812
00:50:17,211 --> 00:50:18,758
Yeah, I think one, just one.

813
00:50:18,758 --> 00:50:19,591
- Mm-hmm.

814
00:50:19,591 --> 00:50:21,560
Could you describe the driver?

815
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,741
- No, it happened so fast,

816
00:50:22,741 --> 00:50:24,394
that I just, didn't even barely--

817
00:50:24,394 --> 00:50:28,561
I didn't think anything like
this was ever gonna happen.

818
00:51:02,151 --> 00:51:06,234
(vehicle starts and drives away)

819
00:51:24,004 --> 00:51:28,171
(plastic tricycle bouncing around)

820
00:51:31,891 --> 00:51:34,974
(vehicle door slams)

821
00:51:46,767 --> 00:51:50,850
(vehicle starts and drives away)

822
00:51:54,145 --> 00:51:58,074
(police radio chatter)

823
00:51:58,074 --> 00:51:58,907
- Thanks.

824
00:52:01,732 --> 00:52:04,883
- Coulda been one of our kids, Denny.

825
00:52:04,883 --> 00:52:06,805
How could God allow that to happen.

826
00:52:06,805 --> 00:52:09,069
- God didn't allow that
little guy to be killed.

827
00:52:09,069 --> 00:52:09,902
Sin did.

828
00:52:10,971 --> 00:52:11,825
A drunken driver,

829
00:52:11,825 --> 00:52:15,820
whose mind was clouded
and controlled by Satan.

830
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:17,722
- I can't buy that.

831
00:52:17,722 --> 00:52:19,815
What if that little boy had been hit by a,

832
00:52:19,815 --> 00:52:23,540
by some little, old lady, who
goes to church every Sunday?

833
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:26,343
- Wayne, let me explain something.

834
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:27,804
In all our experiences of life,

835
00:52:27,804 --> 00:52:29,670
there are times, when we cannot understand

836
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:32,177
why God would allow something to happen.

837
00:52:32,177 --> 00:52:35,283
We can't understand it, because
we don't have all the facts.

838
00:52:35,283 --> 00:52:36,116
God does.

839
00:52:38,049 --> 00:52:40,019
But I can tell you this,

840
00:52:40,019 --> 00:52:42,719
if you're in God's family,
nothing happens to you,

841
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:44,118
if not by design.

842
00:52:44,118 --> 00:52:46,062
(police radio chatter)

843
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:46,895
- All right.

844
00:52:46,895 --> 00:52:48,034
Okay, what if, um...

845
00:52:48,034 --> 00:52:49,069
Okay, what if, let's say that--

846
00:52:49,069 --> 00:52:49,902
- [Dispatcher On Radio] Building nine,

847
00:52:49,902 --> 00:52:54,069

848
00:52:54,084 --> 00:52:55,380

849
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:59,114
- One-35, 4th and Carpenter, on the way.

850
00:52:59,114 --> 00:53:00,906

00:53:04,362 --> 00:53:06,273
Officer needs help, subject's 10-32.

854
00:53:06,273 --> 00:53:08,882
First unit 10-23 advise.

855
00:53:08,882 --> 00:53:12,799
(suspenseful orchestral music)

856
00:53:15,323 --> 00:53:18,156
(liquid dripping)

857
00:53:21,252 --> 00:53:24,752
(officer cocking shotgun)

858
00:53:25,758 --> 00:53:28,591
- [Man Elsewhere In Building] Jim?

859
00:53:35,162 --> 00:53:35,995
- [Dispatcher On Radio] 10-4.

860
00:53:35,995 --> 00:53:38,865
Attention all units, 135 is
10-23 at northeast corner.

861
00:53:38,865 --> 00:53:39,698

862
00:53:43,984 --> 00:53:46,548
(vehicles stopping quickly)

863
00:53:46,548 --> 00:53:49,131
(guns cocking)

864
00:53:57,009 --> 00:53:59,811
- Malwitz, what's your position?

865
00:53:59,811 --> 00:54:00,780
- We're on the second floor,

866
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:04,947
and we got 'em in the northwest
corner, and they are armed.

867
00:54:05,843 --> 00:54:09,579
- You and Steve take the northeast corner,

868
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:12,128
Wayne and I will go in through the door.

869
00:54:12,128 --> 00:54:12,961
You ready?

870
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:15,043
Go.

871
00:54:20,263 --> 00:54:21,096
You ready?

872
00:54:21,096 --> 00:54:21,929
Go.

873
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:34,419
Hey.

874
00:54:34,419 --> 00:54:35,606
Two things.

875
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:36,861
- What's that?

876
00:54:36,861 --> 00:54:40,294
- Before you try to be a
hero, remember eternity?

877
00:54:40,294 --> 00:54:43,294
Try to remember you're a lousy shot.

878
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:45,733
Ready?

879
00:54:48,369 --> 00:54:51,024
(Denny cocking shotgun)

880
00:54:51,024 --> 00:54:54,024
(door crashes open)

881
00:54:55,058 --> 00:54:58,475
(tense orchestral music)

882
00:55:53,968 --> 00:55:56,801
(liquid dripping)

883
00:55:59,959 --> 00:56:02,024
- Okay, in the corner,
we know you're in there.

884
00:56:02,024 --> 00:56:03,615
Just give it up now.

885
00:56:03,615 --> 00:56:04,953
The guy in the corner with the shotgun,

886
00:56:04,953 --> 00:56:07,290
stick it out butt first and follow it out.

887
00:56:07,290 --> 00:56:08,123
Now!

888
00:56:09,043 --> 00:56:11,293
The other one, come on out.

889
00:56:13,608 --> 00:56:15,778
Hold it right there.

890
00:56:15,778 --> 00:56:19,778
- Man in the blue shirt,
take two steps forward.

891
00:56:23,188 --> 00:56:26,021
(liquid dripping)

892
00:56:35,139 --> 00:56:37,056
Take two steps forward.

893
00:56:39,578 --> 00:56:40,995
- He's got a gun.

894
00:56:42,268 --> 00:56:43,364
(gun hammer cocks)

895
00:56:43,364 --> 00:56:46,859
- [Dark-Haired Officer]
Fall to your knees.

896
00:56:46,859 --> 00:56:48,931
Fall straight forward with your arms out,

897
00:56:48,931 --> 00:56:50,431
and your palms up.

898
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:02,192
(liquid dripping)

899
00:57:23,048 --> 00:57:26,131
(handcuffs clicking)

900
00:57:30,018 --> 00:57:33,394
- I'm gonna go get my shotgun, Ron.

901
00:57:33,394 --> 00:57:36,227
(liquid dripping)

902
00:57:45,078 --> 00:57:47,745
(shotgun fires)

903
00:57:48,666 --> 00:57:50,096
Hill!

904
00:57:50,096 --> 00:57:50,929
- Phew.

905
00:57:53,933 --> 00:57:55,433
- You okay, buddy.

906
00:57:57,389 --> 00:57:59,472
- I think I wet my pants.

907
00:58:04,825 --> 00:58:07,691
So you have to shield yourself
from being hurt emotionally.

908
00:58:07,691 --> 00:58:08,917
- Is that possible?

909
00:58:08,917 --> 00:58:10,105
- Oh, sure.

910
00:58:10,105 --> 00:58:11,714
Cops do it all the time.

911
00:58:11,714 --> 00:58:15,196
It's called the callous-cop syndrome.

912
00:58:15,196 --> 00:58:17,857
In other words, a cop deals with emotion,

913
00:58:17,857 --> 00:58:18,933
day in and day out.

914
00:58:18,933 --> 00:58:20,530
He has to build defense mechanisms,

915
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:23,322
or else he's gonna become
an emotional cripple.

916
00:58:23,322 --> 00:58:25,859
Then the public sees
him acting unemotional,

917
00:58:25,859 --> 00:58:27,886
and they wonder, what's
wrong with this guy?

918
00:58:27,886 --> 00:58:29,006
Doesn't he care?

919
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:30,339
Doesn't he feel?

920
00:58:31,884 --> 00:58:33,854
- Couldn't his being unemotional

921
00:58:33,854 --> 00:58:36,255
have an adverse effect on his family?

922
00:58:36,255 --> 00:58:38,255
- Oh, sure, and it does.

923
00:58:39,746 --> 00:58:42,629
Praise God, our relationship,
faith in Christ,

924
00:58:42,629 --> 00:58:44,546
has kept us in balance.

925
00:58:45,582 --> 00:58:47,808
But it's not easy, you know.

926
00:58:47,808 --> 00:58:51,975
A guy can become an unemotional
person and lose his family.

927
00:58:53,441 --> 00:58:57,608
And, if he shows emotion on
the job, he can lose his life.

928
00:58:57,733 --> 00:58:59,523
It's a thin line.

929
00:58:59,523 --> 00:59:03,690
- That's frightening, Denny,
I mean, you lose either way.

930
00:59:03,993 --> 00:59:06,747
- That's why a cop that
doesn't have Christ

931
00:59:06,747 --> 00:59:09,651
is gonna have a pretty rough road.

932
00:59:09,651 --> 00:59:13,818
That's why I want so much for
Wayne to be able to see that.

933
00:59:17,431 --> 00:59:19,773
I really blew it today.

934
00:59:19,773 --> 00:59:21,106
- What happened?

935
00:59:22,228 --> 00:59:25,879
- I just couldn't handle
that little guy being killed.

936
00:59:25,879 --> 00:59:26,712
Got to me.

937
00:59:28,035 --> 00:59:31,090
Wayne, he was solid as a rock

938
00:59:31,090 --> 00:59:32,914
on the outside,

939
00:59:32,914 --> 00:59:35,816
but I know he hurt on the inside.

940
00:59:35,816 --> 00:59:38,588
- You guys see a child beaten or killed,

941
00:59:38,588 --> 00:59:41,883
and you're supposed to sit on all that?

942
00:59:41,883 --> 00:59:43,703
It must be frustrating at times,

943
00:59:43,703 --> 00:59:47,280
wanting to strike back
and not being able to.

944
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,218
- Well, it's natural to wanna strike back,

945
00:59:49,218 --> 00:59:51,994
but you're right, we can't.

946
00:59:51,994 --> 00:59:53,244
But it happens.

947
00:59:54,330 --> 00:59:56,786
A guy can be a model cop
for an entire career,

948
00:59:56,786 --> 00:59:58,875
and let go just once.

949
00:59:58,875 --> 01:00:01,052
He'll answer for it.

950
01:00:01,052 --> 01:00:05,219
- How does a cop get rid
of all that frustration?

951
01:00:05,491 --> 01:00:06,408
How do you?

952
01:00:08,978 --> 01:00:13,145
- I throw my underwear
behind the bathroom door.

953
01:00:13,536 --> 01:00:16,092
- Oh, Denny, you know,

954
01:00:16,092 --> 01:00:19,132
it would be really easy for
our relatioship to suffer,

955
01:00:19,132 --> 01:00:21,715
if you shut me out, so, well, I

956
01:00:24,136 --> 01:00:26,886
I appreciate you sharing with me.

957
01:00:28,222 --> 01:00:31,635
(easy listening music)

958
01:00:31,635 --> 01:00:34,135
(Denny sighs)

959
01:00:35,633 --> 01:00:39,370
- Well, I better get ready and go to work.

960
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:40,868
- Mmm.

961
01:00:40,868 --> 01:00:42,329
- Kids goin' to grandpa's tonight?

962
01:00:42,329 --> 01:00:43,162
- Mm-hmm.

963
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:45,905
- Hmm.

964
01:00:45,905 --> 01:00:48,532
I think you're looking at a cop,

965
01:00:48,532 --> 01:00:51,365
who's about to have a close shave.

966
01:00:53,271 --> 01:00:54,258
- Dad?

967
01:00:54,258 --> 01:00:55,525
- Hmm?

968
01:00:55,525 --> 01:00:59,181
- When can I get a blade on my razor?

969
01:00:59,181 --> 01:01:00,014
- When you get a job,

970
01:01:00,014 --> 01:01:04,181
and can afford to buy
them with your own money.

971
01:01:04,342 --> 01:01:05,828
Hey.

972
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:08,054
Why don't I go to
grandma-and-grandpa's tonight,

973
01:01:08,054 --> 01:01:09,919
and you go to work for me?

974
01:01:09,919 --> 01:01:12,132
- You can't do that, dad.

975
01:01:12,132 --> 01:01:13,376
- Why not?

976
01:01:13,376 --> 01:01:15,652
- 'Cause your hat falls down over my eyes.

977
01:01:15,652 --> 01:01:18,235
(Denny laughs)

978
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:24,983
(slow harp music)

979
01:01:27,324 --> 01:01:30,574
- I surrender into the arms of the law.

980
01:01:31,888 --> 01:01:34,425
- Cindy, could you pick
me up a new watch band?

981
01:01:34,425 --> 01:01:37,478
- If anyone says you're a
spoiled, rotten cop tonight,

982
01:01:37,478 --> 01:01:40,439
tell them your wife agrees.

983
01:01:40,439 --> 01:01:41,939
- Cindy, you're...

984
01:01:43,392 --> 01:01:44,742
I'll tell ya later.

985
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:45,892
- Tell me now.

986
01:01:45,892 --> 01:01:46,874
You won't remember.

987
01:01:46,874 --> 01:01:47,714
You never did remember

988
01:01:47,714 --> 01:01:50,617
to tell me the name of
that guy in the front row.

989
01:01:50,617 --> 01:01:52,402
- Jonathan Augustinsky.

990
01:01:52,402 --> 01:01:53,330
- You're kidding!

991
01:01:53,330 --> 01:01:55,118
I woulda been Cynthia Augustinsky?

992
01:01:55,118 --> 01:01:57,772
- Mm-hmm.
- How gruesome.

993
01:01:57,772 --> 01:02:00,037
(both laughing)

994
01:02:00,037 --> 01:02:02,212
- Todd, after you watch the car go by,

995
01:02:02,212 --> 01:02:04,952
help mom get your things together.

996
01:02:04,952 --> 01:02:06,785
Have fun at grandpa's.

997
01:02:08,619 --> 01:02:10,186
(smacking lips)

998
01:02:10,186 --> 01:02:12,103
- Remember, I love you.

999
01:02:15,166 --> 01:02:16,666
- I love you, too.

1000
01:02:20,006 --> 01:02:23,089
(car engine running)

1001
01:02:46,313 --> 01:02:47,938
- [Wayne] You know, you
never did explain to me

1002
01:02:47,938 --> 01:02:50,314
what that thing was I read in the Bible.

1003
01:02:50,314 --> 01:02:51,340
- [Denny] Psalm 19?

1004
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:52,943
- [Wayne] Yeah. Well, it's
an interesting scripture,

1005
01:02:52,943 --> 01:02:55,798
because, um, I can't remember
it all without the Bible,

1006
01:02:55,798 --> 01:02:59,965
but it says that God placed
the stars in the heavens,

1007
01:03:01,390 --> 01:03:04,739
and put the earth in its orbit,

1008
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:06,406
and that He created,

1009
01:03:07,507 --> 01:03:10,064
designed the universe.

1010
01:03:10,064 --> 01:03:11,944
- [Denny] Do you remember,
when we were talking about

1011
01:03:11,944 --> 01:03:14,050
faith and my car?

1012
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:15,017
- [Wayne] Yeah.

1013
01:03:15,017 --> 01:03:17,783
- (chuckles) Well, Psalm 19 is telling us

1014
01:03:17,783 --> 01:03:20,054
that God created all the universe,

1015
01:03:20,054 --> 01:03:23,958
and that we can see his
handiwork in nature.

1016
01:03:23,958 --> 01:03:25,208
Now, in Romans,

1017
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:29,505
it says that God has
given man the instincts,

1018
01:03:29,505 --> 01:03:31,948
to obey and follow God.

1019
01:03:31,948 --> 01:03:35,393
But Satan has filled men's
hearts with such pride,

1020
01:03:35,393 --> 01:03:37,143
that man ignores God.

1021
01:03:38,697 --> 01:03:40,668
You see, the thing is that,

1022
01:03:40,668 --> 01:03:42,787
since God has given us this knowledge,

1023
01:03:42,787 --> 01:03:45,909
the Bible warns us that
there is no excuse,

1024
01:03:45,909 --> 01:03:48,826
when man comes before the Judgment.

1025
01:03:49,931 --> 01:03:51,480
You know, Wayne,

1026
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:53,482
you seem to want to receive Christ.

1027
01:03:53,482 --> 01:03:55,649
You ask so many questions.

1028
01:03:56,870 --> 01:03:58,953
Why don't you just do it?

1029
01:03:59,949 --> 01:04:00,931
- I don't know, Denny.

1030
01:04:00,931 --> 01:04:01,764
I want to.

1031
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:04,037
And I can't quit thinking

1032
01:04:04,037 --> 01:04:06,904
about what you said about eternity.

1033
01:04:06,904 --> 01:04:08,527
But I, uh,

1034
01:04:08,527 --> 01:04:09,497
I don't know.

1035
01:04:09,497 --> 01:04:10,580
It's so hard.

1036
01:04:11,673 --> 01:04:15,061
I can't seem to feel about
it, the way that you do.

1037
01:04:15,061 --> 01:04:16,728
And, yet, I want to.

1038
01:04:18,301 --> 01:04:20,664
If I, um, if I did become a Christian,

1039
01:04:20,664 --> 01:04:21,497
how,

1040
01:04:22,672 --> 01:04:24,422
I mean, what do I do?

1041
01:04:25,818 --> 01:04:29,872
- Well, first you admit
that you're sinful,

1042
01:04:29,872 --> 01:04:32,122
and ask God to forgive you.

1043
01:04:33,226 --> 01:04:35,285
That's the tough part.

1044
01:04:35,285 --> 01:04:38,862
Then you must believe that
Jesus Christ is the Son of God,

1045
01:04:38,862 --> 01:04:43,029
that He died and shed
His blood for our sins,

1046
01:04:43,082 --> 01:04:44,910
arose three days later,

1047
01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:47,782
and still lives in the hearts of men.

1048
01:04:47,782 --> 01:04:51,199
Then ask Him to be the Lord of your life.

1049
01:04:52,045 --> 01:04:54,326
- That's all there is to it?

1050
01:04:54,326 --> 01:04:56,354
- That's all there is to it.

1051
01:04:56,354 --> 01:04:59,187
- (laughing) Man.

1052
01:05:02,361 --> 01:05:03,604
- You know, Wayne.

1053
01:05:03,604 --> 01:05:05,388
Once you've heard the plan of salvation,

1054
01:05:05,388 --> 01:05:07,555
you're responsible for it.

1055
01:05:09,541 --> 01:05:11,462
You must make a decision.

1056
01:05:11,462 --> 01:05:15,629
If you don't, God may do
something to get your attention.

1057
01:05:23,233 --> 01:05:25,566
Well, we better get to work.

1058
01:05:27,182 --> 01:05:30,182
(crickets chirping)

1059
01:05:45,474 --> 01:05:49,161
(Denny clearing his throat loudly)

1060
01:05:49,161 --> 01:05:51,293
I don't know if I wanna drive with you.

1061
01:05:51,293 --> 01:05:53,282
Besides, it's my turn.

1062
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:54,199
- Go ahead.

1063
01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:56,057
Have at it.

1064
01:06:07,267 --> 01:06:09,094
(engine starts)

1065
01:06:09,094 --> 01:06:09,927
- Are you ready?

1066
01:06:09,927 --> 01:06:10,927
- I'm ready.

1067
01:06:12,476 --> 01:06:13,625
- You sure?

1068
01:06:13,625 --> 01:06:14,542
- I'm sure.

1069
01:06:24,052 --> 01:06:26,969
(yawning) Oh, man.

1070
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:28,653
I'm beat.

1071
01:06:29,954 --> 01:06:34,121
I don't know if I can hack
this for another three hours.

1072
01:06:34,629 --> 01:06:37,172
