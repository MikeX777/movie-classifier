00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,430
We couldn't have met in a worse manner.

2
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,620
It's this late already?!

3
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,580
I'm gonna be late for practice!

00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,680
Oh no, it's all over the floor...

5
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:29,960
Hey, you.

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,680
What do you think you're doing?!

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,300
I'm so sorryâ€”

8
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,840
I have somewhere to be,
so you'd better clean up this mess!

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,930
What's with that look?

10
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,690
It's just, um...

11
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:46,670
Speak up!

12
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,940
I, uh...

13
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,710
I can... see...

14
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,040
Wanna grab something to eat?

15
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,410
Do you ever think about anything but food?

16
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,410
Get back here!

17
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,000
The hell...?

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,550
Something wrong?

19

I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

20
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,060
You saw, didn't you?

21
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,760
No I didn't! I saw nothing!

22
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,640
I would never look at your panda panties!

23
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:17,290
You totally did!

24
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:18,890
Huh?

25
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,580

26
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,960

00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,020
Nacchan, you know this guy?

29
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,520
He's in my class!

30
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,680
In your class?

31
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,030
Yeah, he's my classmate, Ayase Koyuki.

32
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,490
Wait, that means...

33
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,120
I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!

34
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,000
I had no idea you were my senior!

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,120
No, I should be the one apologizing.

36
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,220
I'll clean everything up, so don't worry about it.

37
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,560
We couldn't have met in a worse manner.

38
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,380
But...

39
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,110
I did notice...

40
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:07,940
Someday...

41
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:07,940

in love

45
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,980
Would you mind going out with a younger girl?

46
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,610
Maybe you'd prefer someone who grows their hair out?

47
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,900
If I asked you out now, how would you respond?

48
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,700
I'm just head over heels... in love!

848
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:31,540
The Moment

849
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:31,580
The Moment

850
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,500
The Moment

851
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:38,420
I had my stupid reasons to apply to this school

852
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,180
What's it gonna take from me

853
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,310
To get you to turn your head my way?

854
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:50,190
I hope all my "coincidences" don't push you away

855
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:57,280
Every day a new excuse to jump out and say hi to you

856
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,150
I know that we make an unusual pair (I'll try!)

857
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,070
Yet I'm always inching closer to you (Trying!)

858
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,240
Riverboats

859
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:06,120
Feelings building up inside as I do (Trying!)

860
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,080
I'll give my all tomorrow too (I'll try!)

861
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,000
Would you mind going out with a younger girl?

862
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,340
Would you be too ashamed?

863
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,710
You started living just a little bit before me, my darling

864
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:21,010
You started learning how to love a little bit early

865
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,300
If I seized the hands of time

866
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,810
I'd push my own clock forward just to catch up

867
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,770
You and me could sit together in classes

868
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,730
You and me could make a wonderful couple

869
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,060
Please, just let my wish come true!

870
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,690
Just fall in love with me like I did with you!

871
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,610
It doesn't matter to me

872
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,450
That you are a whole year ahead

873
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:49,540
Please just notice me right by your side

874
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,080
Time to eat!

875
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,780
You're still wearing that hoodie?

876
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,760
Well yeah, it's super comfy!

877
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,640
Yeah, that's why it's my favorite.

878
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,830
Oh, I'll take one, okay?

879
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,110
Sure, go ahead.

880
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,300
I love you, Big Bro!

881
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,530
You're so silly.

882
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,750
You'd better hurry or you'll be late
for your morning practice!

883
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,890
Okey-dokey!

884
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,540
Morning practice again?

885
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,610
Talk about early.

886
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,860
No, you're just late!

887
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,470
You might be stupid, but I admit
waking up this early is impressive.

888
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,160
Very impressive.

889
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,410
Oh, shut up!

890
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,240
I'm off!

891
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,120
Shee ya.

892
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,230
I'm off!

893
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:42,630
Ugh, Kotarou... Why are you here?

894
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,310
Going to morning practice, obviously!

895
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,890
Why else would I be leaving this early?

896
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,190
Great.

897
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,180
My wonderful morning has just been ruined.

898
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,140
That's my line.

899
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,590
Saying "ugh" the moment
you see someone is so rude!

900
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,810
Enomoto

901
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,900
Could at least start with "morning" orâ€”

902
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,550
No time to chat!

903
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,520
Enomoto

904
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,330
Hey, get back here!

905
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,520
At least pretend to listen when someone's talking!

906
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,970
See ya later!

907
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,580
You really think you can outrun
the star of the soccer team?!

908
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,940
And I run hurdles!
Underestimate me at your own peril!

909
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,620
Pass it!

910
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,520
Here!

911
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,070
Kotarou!

912
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,020
Cover!

913
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,400
Nice shot!

914
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,220
Sure enjoying his youth.

915
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,870
Good job putting in effort this early!

916
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:37,340
It's because morning practice is the
only time first-years can touch the ball.

917
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,600
Oh, shut up!

918
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,380
Ready...

919
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,390
One! Two! Three! Four!

920
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,880
Despite our disastrous first meeting...

921
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,490
What's our next class again?

922
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,770
Music.

923
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,510
Good morning, Setoguchi.

924
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,390
H-Hi.

925
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,480
Since then, he's been greeting me every time, but...

926
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,070
Koyuki.

927
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,070
Morning!

928
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:27,820
Morning!

929
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,540
Sakata, Urata!

930
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,060
Oh, morning.

931
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,770
Morning.

932
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:32,940
Is someone there?

933
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,320
N-Not really.

934
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,700
Isn't that... Ayase Koyuki or something?

935
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,210
So you know him, Kotarou?

936
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,220
Natsuki's friend who shares her hobbies?

937
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,620
I don't know much, though.

938
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:52,600
Oh, he stumbled.

939
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,340
What a weirdo!

940
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,230
Enomoto!

941
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,470
Does Setoguchi like that Ayase person?

942
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,820
What? No way!

943
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,530
He's basically a girl!

944
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,030
Really?

945
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,460
Who cares!

946
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,440
Koyuki...

947
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:31,800
Setoguchiâ€”

948
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,840
Ayase!

949
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:37,220
Doing this every day must take a lot of dedication!

950
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,080
Um...

951
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,230
I don't think we've met...

952
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:44,320
Takamizawa Arisa, first year!

953
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,240
Takamizawa?

954
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,110
That's right!

955
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:48,830
Nice to meet you.

956
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,110
It's nice to meet you too!

957
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,320
Takamizawa?

958
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:56,390
Ah, Setoguchiâ€”

959
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,120
Koyuki!

960
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,790
What?

961
00:07:59,470 --> 00:07:59,890
Setoguâ€”

962
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,120
Koyuki!

963
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,110
What?

964
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,060
Ah, Setoâ€”

965
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,320
Yuki!

966
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,760
Need me to help you with the flowers?

967
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,700
No, actually Iâ€”

968
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,810
Great! Happy to help!

969
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,480
Right this way!

970
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,320
Whaâ€”

971
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,380
What's her deal?

972
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:23,690
She's acting all cozy with
Koyuki all of a sudden!

973
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:24,980
Oh, hey Hina.

974
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:26,800
About the next match...

975
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,190
I was put on the team actually, so uh...

976
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,740
I was wondering if you'dâ€”

977
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,700
Man, she ticks me off so much!

978
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,870
Hey, that hurt!

979
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,550
The hell are you doing?!

980
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,160
Hey!

981
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,180
Hina!

982
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:43,970
Hina...

983
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,170
Sheesh.

984
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,520
Wait...

985
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:06,870
Why am I so on edge?

986
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,420
Setoguchi.

987
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,970
It's not like I'm interested in him or anything...

988
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,450
Wait, am I interested?

989
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,020
No, I'm not!

990
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,200
There's no way someone that
useless could be my first love!

991
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:27,750
My type is tall, manly, and dependable!

992
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,950
Like my brother!

993
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,480
But...

994
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:40,550
Every time our eyes meet,
he smiles at me so sweetly...

995
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,030
It's unfair to smile like that.

996
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,730
Ah, Setoguchi.

997
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,530
Are you heading to practice?

998
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,420
Why?

999
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,420
Just because our eyes met...

1000
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,340
If they meet again...

1001
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,150
If they meet just a few more times...

1002
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,150
No! No, I can't!

1003
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,600
I don't want to admit it!

1004
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,430
Setoguchi!

1005
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,000
Is something the matter?

1006
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,160
Are you all right?

1007
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:55,350
See...

1008
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,350
Even though I don't want to admit it,

1009
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,270
even though he's not my type at all,

1010
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,880
I get so happy when we meet.

1011
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,100
I...

1012
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,660
This feeling is...

1013
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,870
Koyuki...

1014
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,380
Graduating is so sad.

1015
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,270
I want to stay with everyone.

1016
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,940
Right, we ended up going to different schools...

1017
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,460
But we'll stay friends forever, won't we?

1018
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,330
Yeah!

1019
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,660
We'll meet up again for sure, right?

1020
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,380
Right!

1021
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,200
Koyuki...

1022
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,520
Setoguchi.

1023
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,090
Which high school are you applying to?

1024
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,590
Sakuragaoka High.

1025
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,800
Sakuragaoka...

1026
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,080
S-Setoguchi?

1027
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,020
Setoguchi?

1028
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:21,760
Um...

1029
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,420
Don't cry, Hina!

1030
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,920
I'll take a picture!

1031
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,550
Okay?

1032
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:30,060
Come on, smile!

1033
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,160
Hey, Kotarou!

1034
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,490
Whatcha doing?

1035
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,780
Mochita... Look at that.

1036
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,450
You're crying way too much!

1037
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:54,330
Why's Hina crying?

1038
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:55,730
No idea.

1039
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,590
Isn't she just sad her friends are graduating?

1040
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,970
Can't say I understand.

1041
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:03,970
If anything, I'm happy all the
older students are leaving.

1042
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:08,100
When you put it like that,
I'm not sure what to think.

1043
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,650
But yeah, the way girls think is a mystery.

1044
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,110
They're always changing their minds,

1045
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,920
you never know when
you're gonna step on a landmine,

1046
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,100
and they're just so annoying to deal with in general.

1047
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,700
Don't tell me you get bossed around by both
your older and younger sisters, Mochita.

1048
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,510
H-How did you figure that out?

1049
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,200
Kotarou?

1050
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,390
What's so special about that guy?

1051
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,880
I just don't get girls!

1052
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,810
There he is!

1053
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,000
Hey!

1054
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:55,690
I won't get to see Koyuki anymore...

1055
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,340
I don't want that!

1056
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,960
I'm going to apply to Sakuragaoka High!

1057
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,580
Huh?

1058
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:17,580
So can you please tutor me, Big Bro?

1059
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,670
Sure, but why Sakuragaoka?

1060
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:29,610
I-Isn't it obvious? I wanna go to
the same high school as you!

1061
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:35,930
Now imagine a world with no feelings at all

No one knows how to try

1210
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,530
We'd give up without a reason why

Natsuki!

Can you explain it to me?

Huh? What makes you think I know?

Wait, isn't that math...

1216

Are you proud of yourself?

1217
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,800
How did you even get into
Sakuragaoka High like that?

1218
00:14:54,490 --> 00:15:00,170
Now imagine a world with no feelings at all

1219
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,000
Dunno, just did!

1220
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,590
Why don't you ask Yuu to teach you?

1221
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,540
No one loves anyone

1222
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:03,590
Hina is aiming for Sakuragaoka too, right?

1223
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,960
No one follows their fate

1224
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,300
So it never could've led me to you

1225
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:06,090
Y-Yeah.

1226
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,590
Who would we live for?

1227
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,070
Ah, I see now!

1228
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:13,330
Did you actually choose Sakuragaoka
because Hina is applying there?

1229
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:11,430
What would our purpose be?

1230
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:14,260
"How embarrassing, I know what that's like"

1231
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:16,890
Hell no, dumbass! You're so dumb!

1232
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,890
That's my reason to be at your side

1233
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,390
Whaâ€”You called me dumb twice!

1234
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,940
When a love meets a love

1235
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:23,060
It's 'cause of how good Sakuragaoka
High's soccer team is! Obviously!

1236
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,350
Locking eyes is a miracle

1237
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:25,300
If you want it, you just have to ask

1238
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,950
I see, I see.

1239
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,240
Figure it out and find what's true

1240
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,470
That's impressive!

1241
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,900
Do your best!

1242
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,760
I'm sure I'll do better than you at least!

1243
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,460
What a rude little brother.

1244
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:45,380
But our world seems upset. Is it something we said?

1245
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,820
Far too often, it seems

1246
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,180
"Love" and "like" alike

1247
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,880
Get left at the side of the road

1248
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:56,600
For that reason alone, I don't know what to do

1249
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,000
I feel powerless

1250
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,480
I take it out on you

1251
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,850
Even though it's just a fact of life

1252
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:05,000
When it's you meeting me

1253
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,480
The encounter's a miracle

1254
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,380
I chased you at max speed

1255
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,360
Stumbling the entire way

1256
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,960
If I had a chance to have a single wish granted

1257
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,130
For anything I want

1258
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:33,660
I would give everyone apart from you and me a blissful life

1259
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,930
And then say to you:

1260
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,980
"You don't need a miracle

1261
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,360
I can bring you happiness

1262
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,230
All by myself"

1263
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:48,440
Letting my feelings out, speaking softly so you can't hear

1264
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:54,240
"You're my love. You're my love. You're my love," I whispered so

1265
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:00,170
Look! There you are!

1266
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,120
There's your name!

1267
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,120
Can you see it?

1268
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,120
We did it!

1269
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,170
We did it! We did it!

1270
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,110

So I'm in class 3, huh...

1419
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,370
Right?

Yeah!

1423
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,110
Look, Koudai.

1424
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,190
What at?

1425
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,630
He's staring at Setoguchi again.

Class 1-4

1512
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:07,340
Let's see, my seat is...

1513
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,740
T-Takamizawa...

1514
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,670
Looks like we're in the same class!

1515
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,530
Let's have a good year, Setoguchi.

1516
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,340
Yeah, let's.

1517
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:24,040
Say, have you met Koyuki yet?

1518
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,370
Are you still in love with him?

1519
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,480
If I answer, it'll only encourage her.

1520
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,880
I should ignore her.

1521
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,830
I'm impressed that you came all the way
to this high school just for him.

1522
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:38,510
Not really. And that wasn't the reason anyway.

1523
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:42,720
But you haven't seen him since his
middle school graduation, have you?

1524
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:47,140
It's been two years.
Maybe he's a totally different person now.

1525
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,830
You sure he still remembers you?

1526
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,660
There's no way he'd forget!

1527
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,920
This is Yuu's sister, Hina!

1528
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,640
Welcome to this school.

1529
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,200
Who made you the boss?

1530
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,770
I'm Setoguchi Hina.

1531
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,960
Thank you for looking after my brother.

1532
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,850
Hina! Not you, too...

1533
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,770
What's the problem?

1534
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:21,740
Actually, me and Hina are basically sisters!

1535
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,220
Yeah!

1536
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,770
I've never considered you my sister, though.

1537
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:27,850
Teehee.

1538
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,430
Hina, huh?

1539
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,100
What a polite girl you are!

1540
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,500
Nice to meet you, Hina.

1541
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,730
Are you used to the school yet?

1542
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:39,170
Yes! It's already been a week, after all.

1543
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:42,130
I didn't know you had a sister, Setoguchi.

1544
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,860
Can't say I expected that.

1545
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,030
Really?

1546
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,020
Yeah.

1547
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,230
Though come to think of it,
you do have this dependable aura.

1548
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,750
Hina, Natsuki, Kotarou...

1549
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,530
I'm absolutely surrounded by children to babysit.

1550
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,960
Why am I on the list?

1551
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:58,460
Kotarou?

1552
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,370
Natsuki's brother.

1553
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:02,650
Don't ignore me!

1554
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,720
Ah, right!

1555
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,060
Nacchan's brother also enrolled here, didn't he?

1556
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,420
Sounds like it's going to get
really lively around here!

1557
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,480
Akarin is as angelic as ever...

1558
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,520
Mochita, we can see you.

1559
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:22,360
I wonder which class Koyuki is in?

1560
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,200
Soccer

1561
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,200
Tennis

1562
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,440
Ah, Kotarou!

1563
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,920
Haruki!

1564
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,710
Good job making it into this school.

1565
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,540
Though if Midori can get in, anybody can.

1566
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,050
Surprisingly easy, right?

1567
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,460
Whatcha say?!

1568
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:43,550
Haruki, you ain't ever gonna
beat me in PE or Health!

1569
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:47,510
There's no entrance exams for those!

1570
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,970
Ah, Serizawa!

1571
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,080
Oh, hey Narumi!

1572
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,080
Get a load of this!

1573
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,230
What is it?

1574
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:03,950
Midori here was just bragging
that no one can beat him in Health!

1575
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,990
You idiot!

1576
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,020
Not Health!

1577
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,080
It's PE! It's PE that I'm good at!

1578
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,150
You can't just say that Sex Ed
is someone's best subject!

1579
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,700
Hey man, I never said that.

1580
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,490
I-I see...

1581
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:15,710
Well, see you guys later.

1582
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,930
No way, it's Narumi Sena!

1583
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,420
I'm not dreaming, am I?

1584
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,510
You're the real deal!

1585
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:26,880
Um, could you stop screaming
and calm down, please?

1586
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,050
Ah, I'm so sorry!

1587
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:31,220
You've been my role model since forever!

1588
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,570
I want to be as amazing as you!

1589
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:38,360
I've been checking out all the CMs
you appear in, and I read your magazines too!

1590
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,070
Um, thank you...

1591
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:41,360
You were also a model for some
new hairstyles recently, weren't you?

1592
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,740
Your hair looked so cute!

1593
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,500
Oh! Could that be...

1594
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:50,870
This hairpin? Yes, I was wearing it for a few pictures.

1595
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:53,660
That's so nice! It's so cute!

1596
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,240
See ya!

1597
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,730
So you really are watching me closely.

1598
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,450
O-Of course!

1599
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,080
I really admire you!

1600
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,700
You're such an amazing person,

1601
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,550
even girls love you.

1602
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,090
Meanwhile, I'm the total opposite...

1603
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:12,720
Oh, I don't think I caught your name.

1604
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:18,650
Class 1-1, Takamizawa Arisa!

1605
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,230
Nice to meet you, Arisa!

1606
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:27,790
It's weird to see Takamizawa
chatting with another girl.

1607
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,150
Hey, Kotarou!

1608
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,700
Hey.

1609
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,390
If you're looking for Setoguchi, she's thataway.

1610
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,850
I-I'm not!

1611
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:41,300
See ya.

1612
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:46,460
I eat HoneyWorld's pudding every day!

1613
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,980
It's so good!

1614
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,750
Wanna go to karaoke today?

1615
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,790
Sure!

1616
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,030
You sure he still remembers you?

1617
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:14,940
What if he really doesn't remember me?

1618
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,390
Setoguchi!

1619
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,440
It's been a while.

1620
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,710
So you came to this high school.

1621
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,550
I did.

1622
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:33,550
I suppose we'll be seeing plenty
of each other again, then.

1623
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,740
Yeah!

1624
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,320
The cherry tress in full bloom lost all
their petals in virtually the blink of an eye.

1625
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:59,890
My first semester passed with little progress
other than just greeting Koyuki.

1626
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,350
But in the second...

1627
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:49,210
I'll definitely talk to him more today!

1628
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,710
Who is that?

1629
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:55,140
He's so cool!

1630
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:13,840
Koyuki has... changed.

1631
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,400
Why?

1632
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,750
I don't even need to ask.

1633
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:32,350
I'm sure it was because he wants
the person he likes to like him back.

1634
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:38,030
That's how it is for everyone.

1635
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:41,380
So why does it sometimes go wrong?

1636
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,860
I'm gonna be late!

1637
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,700
Yukki!

1638
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,860
Where should I plant this flower?

1639
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,190
This belongs right here.

1640
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,460
Yukki! I'll help too!

1641
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,030
Thank you.

1642
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,900
What are those yellow flowers?

1643
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:06,710
They're in the same family
as the ones over there, you see...

1644
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,260
What the heck?!

1645
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:13,210
No one ever cared about him until now!

1646
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:15,270
And now he's surrounded by girls?!

1647
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:18,090
I was first to fall in lâ€”

1648
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,740
Actually...

1649
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:35,550
I guess it doesn't really matter.

1650
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,620
Setoguchi!

1651
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,850
What's wrong, Yukki?

1652
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,830
Was that your friend?

1653
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,430
I don't know anymore!

1654
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:11,020
How can I face Koyuki when
he's trying so hard for the person he likes?

1655
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,710
But... I want...

1656
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,550
I want to talk with him!

1657
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,310
Koyuki...

1658
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,370
Hina!

1659
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:36,730
Big Bro?!

1660
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,360
There was a movie you wanted
to watch, wasn't there?

1661
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:42,240
How about we do something together for a change?

1662
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,870
Come on, get ready.

1663
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,620
It's weird to see you inviting me to something.

1664
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,670
Is it?

1665
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:13,420
I mean, lately you haven't even been
playing games with me anymore!

1666
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:17,440
I know it's easy for you to forget, but...

1667
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,180
I have entrance exams to worry about.

1668
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,440
I know.

1669
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,400
Thanks!

1670
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:31,310
Hina! You're heavy!

1671
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:34,540
Ew, you like your brother?

1672
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:37,540
Kotarou!

1673
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,640
Hi, Kotarou.

1674
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,550
So what?!

1675
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:43,050
You're in love with your sister too!

1676
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:45,120
Of course I'm not, you idiot!

1677
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,630
In denial, are we?

1678
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:48,970
'Cause it ain't true!

1679
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,670
I do not love my sister!

1680
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:52,720
Sister-lover!

1681
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,860
Brother-lover!

1682
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,810
Sister-lover!

1683
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:57,310
Brother-lover!

1684
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,250
Sister-lover!

1685
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,210
Brother-lover!

1686
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:00,920
You two are such good friends.

1687
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,070
No we're not!

1688
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:07,060
Aren't you going somewhere?

1689
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:07,950
You should go.

1690
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,860
I don't need your permission!

1691
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,950
Let's go, Big Bro.

1692
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:16,920
Kotarou.

1693
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:19,460
Thanks.

1694
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,430
Something wrong?

1695
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,160
Let's go.

1696
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:46,730
Huh? I thought you were going somewhere?

1697
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,020
Not anymore.

1698
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:50,990
Why not?

I guess it's fine as long as she's enjoying herself.

1742
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,320
A panda or a polar bear?

1743
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,820
Oh, I dunno...

1744
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,800
It's so hard to choose.

1745
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:39,080
Man, Setoguchi's like... got pretty big boobs, huh?

1746
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,340
What?!

1747
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,580
Hey, keep it down.

1748
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:44,430
What are you staring at, Shibaken?!

1749
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:49,950
Actually, haven't you and Setoguchi known
each other since you were kids, Kotarou?

1750
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,280
Y-Yeah.

1751
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,660
Seriously? So you've touched them before!

1752
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:57,480
Can you give it a rest, you dumbass?!

1753
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,020
You're a healthy teen, aren't you? It's normal!

1754
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,560
There's nothing normal about
what you consider normal!

1755
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,770
Tell him, Koudai!

1756
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,620
I'd rather not get involved in this.

1757
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:09,600
Well? What made you fall for Setoguchi?

1758
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,000
I-I don't know what you're talking about.

1759
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,070
Bam. Proof.

1760
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,340
You can't keep your eyes off her, man.

1762

1763
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:21,210
I-It was j-just a coincidence!

1764
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,420
Don't you think girls like that
are kinda a pain in the ass?

1765
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:28,840
Like, she's too serious, y'know.

1766
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:31,900
If anything I think you're too carefree, Shibaken.

1767
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,520
Y'think?

1768
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,050
'Sup, Rika!

1769
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:36,390
'Bout the date we got planned...

1770
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:38,670
Wait, for real?

1771
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:41,430
Kotarou.

1772
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:42,850
That's perfect!

1773
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:45,860
Don't pay attention to anything Shibaken says.

1774
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,980
Just do what you're comfortable
with and give it your best.

1775
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:56,160
You're both assuming
I'm actually in... love... with Hina.

1776
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:57,490
I haven't said aâ€”

1777
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,910
Oh, were we wrong?

1778
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,370
Which one will you choose?

1779
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:05,030
You see...

1780
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:10,760
That's so like you!

1781
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:19,210
Do my best, huh?

1782
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:23,010
Is it okay to visit her without a reason?

1783
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,560
I'll be going home!

1784
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:29,520
Welcome back!

1785
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,770
Oh, Natsuki. Were you visiting again?

1786
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,080
Yeah.

1787
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,270
Was she around?

1788
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,480
Who?

1789
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,590
You know who I'm talking about!

1790
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:43,170
No, I don't! That's why I'm asking!

1791
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:46,040
The girl who's the same age as me!

1792
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,330
Ah, you're talking about Hina!

1793
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:54,880
D-Did she say anything about me?

1794
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,970
What?

1795
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:58,340
Enomoto

1796
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:58,430
Why would we be talking about you?

1797
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:58,470
Enomoto

1798
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:00,370
I'm just asking!

1799
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:58,590
Enomoto

1800
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:00,970
Enomoto

1801
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:02,330
I get it, don't worry.

1802
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:01,100
Enomoto

1803
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:01,220
Enomoto

1804
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:01,970
Enomoto

1805
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:02,100
Enomoto

1806
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:02,220
Enomoto

1807
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:02,350
Enomoto

1808
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:05,100
I'll bring it up the next time I'm there.

1809
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:02,970
Enomoto

1810
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:03,100
Enomoto

1811
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:03,600
Enomoto

1812
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,230
Enomoto

1813
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,570
No one told you to do that!

1814
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:05,600
Enomoto

1815
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,230
Enomoto

1816
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:06,350
Enomoto

1817
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,980
Enomoto

1818
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:09,920
Ugly bitch!

1819
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,900
You did not just call your big sister that!

1820
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,700
Ugly bitch, ugly bitch, ugly bitch, idiot!

1821
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,300
H-Hey! You're the ugly idiot here!

1822
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,240
Ugly!

1823
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:23,240
Damn. I don't have a chance.

1824
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,040
But...

1825
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:33,210
Even if I know, even if I understand

1826
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:40,600
There's no way I could just turn my back on you like that

1827
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:41,000
I love her...

1828
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:46,100
Even now I'm still... in love

1829
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,330
Kota!

1830
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:56,930
Kota!

1831
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:06,450
Not a guy to count on, nothing to remark on, and he's such a coward, too

1832
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,410
Kota!

1833
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:13,000
I just don't get what it is you see in him

1834
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,090
I want her to laugh.

1835
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:19,510
I saw you acting oh so headstrong, like the gap just wasn't there

1836
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:19,220
Even if I'm not the one she's in love with.

1837
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:25,890
I still couldn't bear to see you two meet

1838
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:32,440
Then I realized, whenever I saw you with him

1839
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:33,030
I'll do everything in my power
to make sure she doesn't cry.

1840
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:38,900
You two would lock eyes, and you would always have a smiling face

1841
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,150
See you!

1842
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:46,580
I couldn't get past just how kind he was to you

1843
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,330
Bye!

1844
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:52,710
In my softest voice, I declare my love for you

1845
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:50,000
It's Haruki and Miou.

1846
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:56,000
Could another step have really been enough

1847
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:56,640
I'm kinda jealous.

1848
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,050
For my voice to make its way to you?

1849
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:05,680
I will always be standing right there by your side

1850
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:15,650
Because I know, I understand it all

1851
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:29,630
Feeling hungry, Kotarou?

1852
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,400
What?

1853
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,940
Hey girls, let's have hamburgers together.

1854
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:38,420
I'd prefer to get home as soon
as possible and study for our tests.

1855
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:38,420
When it comes to eating,
the more the merrier, right?

1856
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:41,770
Can't concentrate on an empty stomach, y'know?

1857
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:42,840
Let's go.

1858
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,560
What's wrong with you?

1859
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:46,080
Relax, I'll pay.

1860
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,010
All righty then, shall we introduce ourselves?

1861
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,700
Pleasure to meet you, Mademoiselle

1862
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,900
Oh, Misato?

1863
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,360
I hail from the West

1864
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,610
Yeah, I'm fine now.

1865
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,070
I have come all this way just for you

1866
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:07,750
What? Now?

1867
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:08,830
That I may see your face

1868
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:10,240
This may all be quite sudden for you

1869
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:13,250
Obviously I was thinking about you.

1870
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,250
But there's no need to be alarmed

1871
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:14,000
Every prince seeks a princess, of course

1872
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,440
It's "Misato only" anytime, anywhere.

1873
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,790
Could you be the one for me?

1874
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,460
I never think about other girls, seriously.

1875
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,220
No, really. Always.

1876
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:24,680
I only ever dream about you, seriously.

1877
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,050
No, I'm serious!

1878
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:28,250
What's wrong with these people?

1879
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,250
What about you?

1880
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:31,140
Is something the matter, Mademoiselle?

1881
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:30,920
No, I haven't.

1882
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,810
Your face is rather drawn

1883
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:34,640
This sort of look doesn't suit you; chin up

1884
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,270
Won't you lend me your ear?

1885
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:38,060
You're under no obligation, of course, but

1886
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,610
Why don't you come with me?

1887
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:41,360
You could just leave your whole life here behind

1888
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,070
And follow me to the East

1889
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:46,530
Those red lips upon your face

1890
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:50,030
Look to be so very lonely

1891
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:53,000
I can cast a gentle spell

1892
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,120
To ease your heart

1893
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,880
Come on now, put on your most wonderful dress

1894
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,710
So I can take your hand and ask for a dance with the most dear, sweet princess

1895
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,180
What's wrong?

1896
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:05,420
Everyone wants to make you theirs

1897
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,260
You can drive us all to madness for you

1898
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:06,990
Oh, nothing.

1899
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:12,100
It's always been a dream of mine to stop by
somewhere with friends on the way home.

1900
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,970
So I'll steal true love's kiss

1901
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:12,430
Close your eyes, I've a present for you

1902
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,060
I see...

1903
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:14,020
Now look up, to the sky

1904
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,390
All the shining stars

1905
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:17,480
I'll bring them down just for you

1906
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:20,980
The best thing they have here is this apple pie!

1907
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,100
The whole world wants to make you theirs

1908
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,980
We would all do anything to be with you

1909
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:23,940
And your name is Julietta

1910
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:25,970
Here, have half!

1911
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:28,890
It's really sweet.

1912
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,030
Well, since you're offering...

1913
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,710
You needn't leave me, Mademoiselle

1914
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,300
Stay with me by my side

1915
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:42,420
Sorry, girls, that took a while.

1916
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,250
You've such a wonderful smile right now

1917
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:45,340
All right, in order to get to know each other better,

1918
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,840
I'd hate to see it fade

1919
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,590
And if you should happen to shed a tear

1920
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:47,970
let's do an "ask me anything"!

1921
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:47,970
I'm sure it will be one of joy

1922
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:49,930
We can spend life hand in hand

1923
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:51,850
Smiling until the end

1924
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:53,930
How would you want someone to ask you out?

1925
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,480
You first, Kotarou.

1926
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:59,860
H-How the hell would I know?!

1927
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,810
I've never thought about these things before!

1928
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:03,160
What about you, Hina?

1929
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,780
As a girl, surely you've thought about it.

1930
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,870
Like, you want him to say this, or do this with him...

1931
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:17,200
I really don't know.

1932
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,060
With a figure like that you're bound
to be a hit with the boys, right?

1933
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,970
Wait, lemme guess. There's someone you like.

1934
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:26,270
Aha, knew it. Who's the lucky guy?
Someone we know?

1935
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:30,230
Come on, don't be shy. We're all friends here.

1936
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:32,630
We're even in the same class. Come on?

1937
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,510
You're a total jerk!

1938
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:37,400
What? What did I do?

1939
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,060
Can't you see you're making her uncomfortable?

1940
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,570
Takamizawa...

1941
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,170
Don't be like that.

1942
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:50,900
No need to get all scary.

1943
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:56,080
You're cute, Arisa.
A smile suits you better, yeah?

1944
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,660
Don't play dumb.

1945
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,420
No idea what you mean.

1946
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:04,080
No one's having fun and yet
you're laughing like an idiot.

1947
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,960
But we are having fun!

1948
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:10,590
Better to laugh instead of just being all serious.

1949
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,410
I'm sure doing that...

1950
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:16,510
isn't fun at all!

1951
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,250
Okay, that's enough!

1952
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:23,070
Our food's getting cold, so let's just eat.

1953
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:29,480
Y-You're right.

1954
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,550
Let's eat!

1955
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,050
Hey, Kotarou!

1956
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:36,320
Ketchup!

1957
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,910
What are you even doing?

1958
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,750
Yeah! What are you even doing?

1959
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:46,500
Dangerous stuff, that ketchup, eh?

1960
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,080
I came to the same high school,

1961
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,210
and yet nothing's changed...

1962
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:18,650
Oh? Hina?

1963
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,090
Miou.

1964
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:34,030
You seem a bit down, Hina.

1965
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,430
I'm not really...

1966
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:39,610
Are you not with Haruki today?

1967
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:40,800
Hm? Nah.

1968
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,970
I see.

1969
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:46,850
What do you usually talk with Haruki about?

1970
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:49,720
Why are you suddenly so curious?

1971
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,170
Aw come on, tell me!

1972
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:53,710
Just... stuff.

1973
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,320
Normal stuff.

1974
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,320
What's that supposed to mean?

1975
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,330
Normal stuff is just stuff that's normal.

1976
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:03,060
Things that happened at school, friends...

1977
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:06,590
Sometimes the movies that Haruki likes.

1978
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:10,000
It really is always just the most unimportant things.

1979
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,340
What's wrong?

1980
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,690
Did something happen
between you and your friends?

1981
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:18,470
You had a falling out and it's hard
to talk to them now, or something?

1982
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,390
Well, not exactly, but...

1983
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:23,910
Actually...

1984
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:26,850
It's like we're not even at that stage yet.

1985
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:30,050
When I wonder what they're thinking about,

1986
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:40,870
Yoshida Public Library

1987
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:33,560
or what they think of me,

1988
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,710
all of a sudden I'm lost for words.

1989
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:44,390
If only I could just let it all out!

1990
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,320
I know what you mean.

1991
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:52,340
I want them to know how I feel
because I want to be friends with them,

1992
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:56,250
but if I tell them, it might end up
making us more distant instead.

1993
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:58,680
Is this about love?

1994
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,380
Huh?!

1995
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:02,170
So there's someone you like, huh?

1996
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,520
M-Miou!

1997
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:09,450
It's fine. I won't tell Setoguchi.

1998
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,660
You know, I have a friend who's full of regrets.

1999
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:20,690
She's been lying to herself,

2000
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:23,150
and she's still unable to voice her feelings.

2001
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,320
She knows that she's in love,

2002
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,090
but she lacks the courage.

2003
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:35,430
Isn't that silly?

2004
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:44,590
Maybe she's also scared of becoming distant,

2005
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:46,890
and that's why she can't say anything.

2006
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,070
Just like me.

2007
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:52,840
Yeah.

2008
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:56,890
But it's not like we have forever.

2009
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,450
If we graduate without saying anything,

2010
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:03,930
our loved ones might go somewhere far away.

2011
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:06,410
And before you know it, that distance you mention

2012
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:09,410
might become far more literal than you expect.

2013
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,320
Graduation...

2014
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:30,490
I wonder if Koyuki will also go
far away once he graduates.

2015
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:32,940
How many more times...

2016
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:38,030
How many more times will I still get
to talk with him face-to-face?

2017
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:49,490
To battle!

2018
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:03,110
How the heck do I even write a love letter?

2019
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:10,060
Ayase Koyuki,

2020
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:10,060
I don't really get a chance to talk to you at school, so...

2021
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:21,860
Dear Koyuki,

2022
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:22,030
Dear Koyuki,

2023
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:22,070
Dear Koyuki,

2024
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:22,110
Dear Koyuki,

2025
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:22,150
Dear Koyuki,

2026
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:22,190
Dear Koyuki,

2027
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:22,240
Dear Koyuki,

2028
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:22,280
Dear Koyuki,

2029
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:22,320
Dear Koyuki,

2030
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:22,360
Dear Koyuki,

Dear Koyuki,

2094

Dear Koyuki,

2095
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:25,070
Dear Koyuki,

2096
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:25,110
Dear Koyuki,

2097
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:25,160
Dear Koyuki,

2098
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:25,200
Dear Koyuki,

2099
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:25,240
Dear Koyuki,

2100
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:25,280
Dear Koyuki,

2101
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:25,320
Dear Koyuki,

2102
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:25,360
Dear Koyuki,

2103
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:29,880
I'll write it all down.

2104
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,430
Every last one of my feelings.

2105
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:39,540
Say, all these feelings inside of you

2106
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:43,510
Aren't you gonna need to bury them away?

2107
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:48,010
Acting as if they're feeling down

2108
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:50,430
Acting as if they're withering

2109
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:54,980
The thorny flowers all droop their faces to the ground

2110
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:59,310
I want my secrets to stay with me

2111
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:01,730
But I still want to bloom so free

2112
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:06,200
You introduced me to this pain, and so I want to give my thanks

2113
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:10,450
Please give me the courage to confess my love

2114
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:13,290
This love which I can never quite express to you

2115
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:16,790
It always seems as if the words escape me

2116
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,800
I'm not just gonna ask for you to hold me

2117
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,670
I like to think that I'm not quite that weak

2118
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:29,340
But deep inside I think it might be what I want

2119
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:34,930
All of those flowers that we planted together

2120
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:40,560
They tell us the next season is about to begin

2121

And when our time together is almost at an end

2140
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:51,740
We should plant some more

2141
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:57,040
Please let all the love I feel reach you

2142
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,880

Dear Koyuki,
I bet you're surprised by this sudden letter, right?
I can totally see your face right now!
We first met in middle school, remember?
I don't know about you, but I can recall it very clearly.
You tripped and spilled rubbish all over the floor
I had just cleaned!
I'm really sorry I ended up chasing and yelling at you,
not knowing you were a third-year...
Since then, every time our eyes met, you'd start talking to me.
That smile you gave me should be reserved only for the girl
you like...
Yet it made me really, really happy.
I looked forward to seeing you at school so much,
I would look around for you every day.
And the reason I was crying at your graduation ceremony...
Part of it was obviously that I wouldn't see my big bro
(Setoguchi Yuu - that's my brother) or Nacchan at school
anymore, but when I thought about how you were graduating
as well, the tears just started flowing...
I've kept the picture we took that day
in my room this whole time.
When I entered high school, I saw that you had cut your hair,
become more handsome, become more popular, and in just one
year already a talking point of the whole school!
I have to admit, I was a little bit jaelous.
But I knew that even though I've had these feelings
for a while, I had to put them into words, because they
wouldn't ever reach you otherwise, which is why I'm writing
this letter.
I love you, Koyuki.
You're so irresponsible, yet so kind and strong.
Please let me stay in love with you.
Hina

2145
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:08,340
Please let me feel all the love inside me

2146
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:11,260
I'm not even sad, so this doesn't make sense

2147
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:16,100
Why is it that I feel like I'm on the verge of tears?

2148
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:19,640
I found the strength to say it on that day alone

2149
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:22,610
And now I know I won't achieve the same today

2150
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:25,980
I'm glad that you're the one I fell for

2151
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:30,950
I'm grateful that you were the one I first loved

2152
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:33,870
I'm grateful that you were the one I first confessed to

2153
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:38,750
When spring comes 'round, why don't we make the flowers bloom some more?

2154
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:46,380
Yes, all the flowers that I know you so adore

2155
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,330

I'm sorry! I'm stealing him for an urgent matter!

2166
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,930
Hey, I never agreed!

2167
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:03,400
If you don't go right now...

2168
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:05,950
I...

2169
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:10,370
I owe a lot to both you and Setoguchi.

00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:41,550
I never seem to be able to find the right words.

2337
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:45,730
No matter how hard I try, I end up running in circles.

2338
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:48,150
But you know...

2339
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:50,940
If you give up, it's all over!

2340
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:52,920
Takamizawa.

2341
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:54,520
Thanks!

2342
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:58,370
Good luck, Enomoto!

2343
00:49:58,370 --> 00:49:59,440
Thanks!

2344
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:25,890
Congratulations, my former love.

2345
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,190
He hasn't gone home yet, has he?

2346
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:37,040
He should be done with his club by now...

2347
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,300
He's late.

2348
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:47,480
Koyukâ€”

2349
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:55,580
Setoguchi.

2350
00:50:58,390 --> 00:50:59,810
Did something happen?

2351
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:01,730
What are you doing here?

2352
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:07,370
This is the worst timing ever.

2353
00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:10,320
Um...

2354
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,830
I have to say it.

2355
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:14,730
"I've been waiting for you."

2356
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,510
I have to say it!

2357
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:18,340
Um...

2358
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,410
What about you?

2359
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:27,730
I got heartbroken.

2360
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:30,860
Heartbroken...

2361
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,890
Though I guess it doesn't really concern you...

2362
00:51:34,890 --> 00:51:36,530
I like you.

2363
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:39,980
I like you, Koyuki!

2364
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:48,260
You don't have to try and cheer me up.

2365
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:51,920
Thank you.

2366
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:57,710
That's not... what I meant.

2367
00:52:00,810 --> 00:52:04,950
You should go home before it gets dark.

2368
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:15,520
See you.

2369
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:48,860
Wait!

2370
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:51,910
You are...

2371
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:53,770
You!

2372
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:56,980
You made Hina crâ€”

2373
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:06,020
Can't you even tell when a girl's being serious?!

2374
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,620
Are you in love with Setoguchi?

2375
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,100
Whâ€”

2376
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:16,020
Be sure not to have any regrets.

2377
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:19,600
Wait.

2378
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:28,970
What's wrong with him?

2379
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:55,220
Let's go home.

2380
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,350
Don't you want to give it to him?

2381
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:25,550
It's fine.

2382
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:26,980
No it's not.

2383
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,450
Didn't you put your heart and soul into it?

2384
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:31,720
It's not like it'd change anything.

2385
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:34,720
Man, that really pisses me off.

2386
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,020
Why are you upset now?

2387
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:38,730
'Cause I just am.

2388
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,590
At him, and at myself for not
being able to do anything...

2389
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:46,590
It really pisses me off.

2390
00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:50,460
You're such a weirdo.

2391
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:01,990
By the way, do you think
you'll get on the soccer team?

2392
00:55:02,410 --> 00:55:03,180
'Course.

2393
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:04,350
Hundred percent!

2394
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:07,050
It'd be nice if you could do it
through sheer willpower.

2395
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:08,500
It's important!

2396
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:11,990
I can do my best because I'm so confident.

2397
00:55:12,490 --> 00:55:15,170
Even if you know it might not go well?

2398
00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:16,780
That won't stop me.

2399
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:20,020
When you're serious about something,
you gotta go all out.

2400
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:22,430
No matter what happens.

2401
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:26,130
Yeah.

2402
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:30,360
We have a match for regular team members soon.

2403
00:55:31,010 --> 00:55:32,260
Come and watch.

2404
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:34,740
Maybe if I have nothing better on...

2405
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:35,820
You little...

2406
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:37,390
If I feel like it!

2407
00:55:39,850 --> 00:55:41,710
So, when is it?

2408
00:55:47,570 --> 00:55:50,410
You're the one who made me who I am

2409
00:55:50,410 --> 00:55:53,320
I never expected to turn out this way

2410
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:55,910
Now I know I need you in my life

2411
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:59,120
It just has to be you, please stay with me

2412
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:13,010
"Hey, just curious, which class are you in?"

2413
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:15,470
Class 2-1

2414
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:15,470
Class 2-2

2415
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:15,470
Class 2-3

2416
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:15,470
Class 2-4

2417
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:15,100
Acting super nonchalant

2418
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:17,980
"Are we in the same one?

2419
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:20,850
Not that I care either way"

2420
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:24,400
"So you were hoping to be in my class?"

2421
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,520
Giving you a teasing prod

2422
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:29,280
"Look at that, guess we are!

2423
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,120
Now we have an example to set"

2424
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:35,330
"Oh, by the way,

2425
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:38,620
I got on the team, why don't you watch me play?"

2426
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:40,960
"Well, I did say

2427
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,830
I would come, so I'll see you there"

2428
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:45,250
There you were

2429
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:48,000
I heard you shout out

2430
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,260
"You'd better win it all!"

2431
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:53,930
You're the one who made me who I am

2432
00:56:53,930 --> 00:56:56,930
I never expected to turn out this way

2433
00:56:56,930 --> 00:56:59,520
Now I know I need you in my life

2434
00:56:59,430 --> 00:57:02,560
It just has to be you, please stay with me

2435
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:05,230
Used to hate how forward you could be

2436
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:08,190
But now I feel like something might've changed

2437
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:11,110
"Look at him now, shining like a hero"

2438
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:13,860
Then when our eyes met, I turned all red

2439
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:16,740
It felt like my heart skipped a beat

2440
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:17,160
gasp

2441
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:17,200

3747
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:59,030
But the rumors and the teasing followed us

3748
00:57:59,030 --> 00:58:01,450
"Hate this kind of thing

3749
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:04,330
Being laughed at really hurts"

3750
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:05,710
So I thought

3751
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:08,540
I'd answer them by

3752
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:11,750
Just reaching for your hand

3753
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:14,340
When you're sad and when you want to cry

3754
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:17,390
I promise I'll make you happy again

3755
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:20,300
Now I know I want to see you smile 'cause

3756
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:22,930
That's the look that suits you best

3757
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:25,640
"Don't tell me what I already know!"

3758
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:28,690
I couldn't admit how I really felt

3759
00:58:28,690 --> 00:58:31,230
Honestly, you made me really glad

3760
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:34,360
So I wish I'd been more honest with you

3761
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:37,240
"Sorry for exploding like that..."

3762
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:44,330
Friends were making fun of me

3763
00:58:44,330 --> 00:58:45,710
"Hey man, don't you give her up"

3764
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:47,710
Oh, so nice of them

3765
00:58:47,710 --> 00:58:53,710
"Sorry, I'm not the type to give up that easily"

3766
00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:55,260
"Say, tonight..."

3767
00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:55,260
"Yeah, what's up?"

3768
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:56,630
"Can we meet?"

3769
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:56,630
"Sure, why not"

3770
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:58,010
"Listen though"

3771
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:58,010
"What is it?"

3772
00:58:58,010 --> 00:58:59,430
"Gotta ask"

3773
00:58:58,010 --> 00:58:59,430
"Go ahead"

3774
00:58:59,430 --> 00:59:05,770
"Do you have someone who you maybe like?"

3775
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:09,480
You saw through me and then simply said

3776
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:12,440
Without any chance for me to confess

3777
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:14,900
"Sorry, but there's already someone

3778
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:18,110
Who I like, I've always liked him so much"

3779
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:43,140
Everything's changed

3780
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:46,430
Things are awkward now and you're avoiding me

3781
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:48,770
"Why does it hurt?"

3782
00:59:48,770 --> 00:59:51,600
I can't soothe my aching heart

3783
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:53,020
But I ran

3784
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:55,780
I chased you and tried

3785
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:58,990
To shout out how I feel

3786
00:59:58,990 --> 01:00:01,660
You should know my feelings won't change

3787
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:04,620
You love someone else, but nevertheless

3788
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:07,250
Now I know that I'm in love with you

3789
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:10,330
And nothing's gonna change how I feel

3790
01:00:10,330 --> 01:00:13,000
Used to hate how forward you could be

3791
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,960
But now I feel like something might've changed

3792
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:18,920
"Look at him now, he really is my true hero"

3793
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:21,590
Then our eyes met, I turned all red

3794
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:24,430
It felt like my heart skipped a beat

3795
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:29,060
Could I really be... in love?

3796
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:52,760
So, as luck would have it,
I have four movie tickets here!

3797
01:00:53,170 --> 01:00:57,300
It seems both Yuu and I bought a pair.

3798
01:00:57,670 --> 01:00:59,860
But it would be a shame to let them go to waste.

3799
01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:03,180
What should we do now?

3800
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:04,560
Do whatever the hell you want.

3801
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:07,010
Got something in mind?

3802
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:10,910
Let's go on a double date!

3803
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:18,730
I'm so excited!

3804
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:20,490
When's the last time we saw a movie together?

3805
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:23,870
You think those two'll work out as a couple?

3806
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:27,620
For sure! They've been in love
with each other since forever.

3807
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:29,300
They're a good match.

3808
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:31,910
Are you okay with your brother
being snatched away?

3809
01:01:31,910 --> 01:01:33,890
It's okay if it's Nacchan.

3810
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:36,850
I want him to find happiness anyway.

3811
01:01:36,850 --> 01:01:37,940
Huh...

3812
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:42,470
What about you, huh? Are you devastated
your sister's being snatched away?

3813
01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:44,470
What? Why would I be?!

3814
01:01:44,670 --> 01:01:46,590
I can see right through you.

3815
01:01:46,590 --> 01:01:48,330
You're totally in love with Nacchan!

3816
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:49,740
'Course not, you idiot!

3817
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:52,590
Yeah, yeah, no need to get all embarrassed!

3818
01:01:52,590 --> 01:01:54,840
We've known each other for so long I can tell!

3819
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:57,230
Hell no! The one I like isâ€”

3820
01:01:58,770 --> 01:01:59,800
...you.

3821
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:04,950
I know.

3822
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:09,580
Oh, I forgot to mention!

3823
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:14,420
Congrats on making the starting team!

3824
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:21,500
Hey, what's taking you so long?

3825
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:23,110
The movie's about to start.

3826
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:25,730
Is something wrong, Kotarou?

3827
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:27,630
You're all red!

3828
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:29,620
Like a monkey!

3829
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:32,300
Who are you calling a monkey?!

3830
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:34,420
Let's go, Big Bro!

3831
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:37,180
Hey! Hina!

3832
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:39,270
He's mine!

3833
01:02:39,270 --> 01:02:42,040
We're on a date today!

3834
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:45,210
Hey! Don't leave me behind!

3835
01:02:45,210 --> 01:02:46,730
Chop chop, Kotarou!

3836
01:02:46,730 --> 01:02:48,240
Movie's not gonna wait!

3837
01:02:49,210 --> 01:02:52,450
Let's just leave him behind!
