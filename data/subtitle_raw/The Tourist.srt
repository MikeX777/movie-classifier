1
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,135
Thank you, Detective.

2
00:00:42,714 --> 00:00:45,794
- Any change?
- Nothing since you left.

3
00:00:52,988 --> 00:00:55,585
She seems to be looking for something.

4
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:59,234
Camera?

5
00:01:23,961 --> 00:01:26,662
She has a nice ass.

6
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:30,407
Stay focused on the mission.

7
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,336
Keep an eye on her,
but don't get too close.

8
00:01:51,605 --> 00:01:53,832
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

9
00:01:53,835 --> 00:01:55,180
What can I get for you?

10
00:01:55,341 --> 00:01:57,291
Tea with milk and fresh orange juice..

11
00:01:57,293 --> 00:01:59,780
- ...and a croissant with butter.
- I've already attended to it.

12
00:02:00,012 --> 00:02:02,107
- Thank you.
- No problem.

13
00:02:08,466 --> 00:02:12,665
- Say again?
- She's drinking her tea!

14
00:02:13,168 --> 00:02:15,434
- Can I get you a tea, sir?
- No, no thank you.

15
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,077
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

16
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:39,810
- I'm looking for Elise Ward.
- Ward, the lady.

17
00:02:40,063 --> 00:02:41,398
Okay, thanks.

18
00:02:43,421 --> 00:02:47,160
- Good morning. Elise Ward?
- Yes, that's me.

19
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,475
I have a letter for you.

20
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:49,801
She's talking to someone.

21
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,475
A delivery boy.

22
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:02,049
Scotland Yard, London.

23
00:03:02,076 --> 00:03:03,139
Yes?

24
00:03:03,374 --> 00:03:08,874
She's at the usual cafe, she's speaking
with a man, it looks like a messenger...

25
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:12,481
But you said to call if anything
changed in her routine.

26
00:03:15,507 --> 00:03:18,644
Stay on his face.  His face!

27
00:03:22,454 --> 00:03:27,845
- Do you think it's Alexander Pierce?
- I think everybody's Pierce.

28
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:31,268
No, it's okay.
It is a gift, you can keep it.

29
00:03:31,285 --> 00:03:32,541
Thank you.

30
00:03:35,434 --> 00:03:38,920
- Here you go, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

31
00:03:47,532 --> 00:03:49,443
Get him.

32
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,548
Alright, grab him.

33
00:03:51,663 --> 00:03:53,221
Let's move.

34
00:03:53,854 --> 00:03:56,879
Sir, sir! Sir, we are police.

35
00:04:00,076 --> 00:04:02,329
- What did I do?
- You're under arres.t

36
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,258
- You're coming with us.
- What did I do?

37
00:04:06,888 --> 00:04:09,047
What are you arresting me for?

38
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:24,064
"Elise, you have no reason
to trust me any more..."

39
00:04:24,593 --> 00:04:26,550
"But give me a chance to explain myself."

40
00:04:27,113 --> 00:04:31,184
"I know the police are watching you,
we have to throw them off the trail."

41
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:35,067
"Board the 8:22 at the Gare De Lyon"

42
00:04:35,295 --> 00:04:38,918
"Pick someone my height and build,
and make them believe it is me."

43
00:04:45,987 --> 00:04:47,920
"Burn this letter."

44
00:04:48,296 --> 00:04:51,455
"It is important you follow my instructions
precisely. I love you, Alexander."

45
00:04:52,053 --> 00:04:54,450
It's from him.

46
00:04:58,282 --> 00:05:00,351
It's from him.

47
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,999
Save that letter, go in now.
Save that letter!

48
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,268
Go, now!

49
00:05:30,793 --> 00:05:34,801
- No, stop! Police!
- What happened?

50
00:05:35,824 --> 00:05:37,230
Well?

51
00:05:38,524 --> 00:05:41,568
The letter is burned to shit.

52
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,421
Don't fucking touch it.

53
00:05:44,453 --> 00:05:48,329
Collect the ashes, take them to the van.
I'll send you someone.

54
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:15,295
The road's too narrow,
we have to go around.  Quick!

55
00:06:26,231 --> 00:06:30,580
Turn right!
Quick, go!

56
00:06:57,804 --> 00:06:59,206
Let's go

57
00:07:10,953 --> 00:07:12,923
Police. Make way!

58
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,181
Wednesday meeting.

59
00:07:50,184 --> 00:07:54,503
So, Alexander Pierce has a new
face just as you suspected.

60
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,656
I'd have thought it must've taken quite a lot
of the money he stole from Reginald Shaw.

61
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:03,321
To finance this transformation.

62
00:08:04,703 --> 00:08:09,338
Ahmed Toubali, bicycle
courier of Algerian descent.

63
00:08:10,576 --> 00:08:14,249
Not only has Pierce acquired
a wife, and a child...

64
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:18,598
He is also 4 inches shorter
than the used to be.

65
00:08:19,334 --> 00:08:21,537
That must have been
a big item of expenditure?

66
00:08:24,643 --> 00:08:28,219
Congratulations Acheson,
You have indeed cracked this case.

67
00:08:33,686 --> 00:08:37,874
Sir, this morning she recieved a note...
and we have strong reason to believe.

68
00:08:37,877 --> 00:08:43,831
Alexander Pierce has
744 million in illegal assets.

69
00:08:43,867 --> 00:08:47,971
That given he is a British
Subject, we might seize.

70
00:08:48,006 --> 00:08:51,501
This operation so far has
cost me 8 million pounds.

71
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:56,313
If I thought there were more than a one in
a hundred chance you could be successful...

72
00:08:56,689 --> 00:08:58,889
It would be rational for me
to continue this operation...

73
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:03,453
I do not.

74
00:09:09,212 --> 00:09:10,430
... that's an amendment... yes...

75
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,672
Thank you, sir.

76
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,234
8:22

77
00:10:27,186 --> 00:10:29,591
- Sir, the projection for the pension plan...
- Not now.

78
00:10:34,118 --> 00:10:35,927
<i>"8:22 Lyon"</i>

79
00:10:36,081 --> 00:10:39,395
Are they meeting in Lyon at 8:22?

80
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:41,752
- Gare de Lyon, perhaps?
- Gare de Lyon...

81
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:52,864
That's it, Gare De Lyon!
The train station, she's getting on a 8:22 train.

82
00:10:52,874 --> 00:10:54,057
Go!

83
00:11:01,325 --> 00:11:04,533
<i>"Board the 8:22 at the Gare De Lyon"</i>

84
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:23,700
<i>"Pick someone my height and build,
and make them believe it is me"</i>

85
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,833
- I'm sorry.
- What for?

86
00:12:51,046 --> 00:12:53,884
Do you mind me smoking?
It's not a real cigarette.

87
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,739
- What?
- It's electronic.

88
00:12:55,889 --> 00:13:01,454
It delivers the same amount of nicotine,
but the smoke is water vapor. Yeah, watch!

89
00:13:02,016 --> 00:13:04,905
LED light.

90
00:13:07,215 --> 00:13:08,982
That's somewhat disappointing.

91
00:13:09,988 --> 00:13:12,787
Would you rather have me smoking for real?

92
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:16,117
No, I would rather you be a
man who did exactly as he pleased.

93
00:13:18,286 --> 00:13:20,964
- I'm Elise.
- I'm Frank.

94
00:13:20,975 --> 00:13:25,244
- That's a terrible name.
- Yeah, it's the only one I've got.

95
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:29,533
- Maybe we can find you another...
- Okay.

96
00:13:33,975 --> 00:13:40,840
You're British.
I'm American.

97
00:13:43,961 --> 00:13:46,637
What brings you to Venice?

98
00:13:47,253 --> 00:13:51,174
You read spy novels.
I am a mysterious woman on a train..

99
00:13:51,196 --> 00:13:54,142
You tell me what my story is.

100
00:13:55,174 --> 00:13:57,363
Okay...

101
00:14:00,316 --> 00:14:04,885
I think you would be a diplomat attachÃ©.

102
00:14:04,952 --> 00:14:10,891
Or maybe a girl from East Germany
whose father's been kidnapped.

103
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:14,959
And they're blackmailing you
into stealing something for them...

104
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,581
Probably microfilm, there's
usually microfilm involved.

105
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:20,158
- What awaits me?
- Trouble, certainly.

106
00:14:20,187 --> 00:14:22,064
- Danger?
- Oh, yeah.

107
00:14:22,725 --> 00:14:25,253
You'll most likely be shot at
in less than two chapters!

108
00:14:28,017 --> 00:14:31,059
Is there a man in my life?

109
00:14:33,353 --> 00:14:36,682
... have to wait and see.

110
00:14:37,071 --> 00:14:40,473
- Invite me to dinner, Frank.
- What?

111
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:48,663
- Would you like to have the dinner?
- Women don't like questions.

112
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:54,907
- Join me for dinner.
- Too demanding.

113
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:59,037
- Join me for dinner?
- Another question.

114
00:15:02,918 --> 00:15:08,853
I'm having dinner...
If you'd care to join me.

115
00:15:27,202 --> 00:15:28,887
Musician?

116
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,433
Bartender?

117
00:15:39,026 --> 00:15:40,893
I give up.

118
00:15:41,932 --> 00:15:45,692
Math, I teach maths.

119
00:15:46,582 --> 00:15:49,138
I would not have guessed that.

120
00:15:50,445 --> 00:15:52,979
I'd imagine you're a cool
math teacher, though?

121
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:55,134
Still a math teacher.

122
00:16:09,254 --> 00:16:13,439
- Can I take your picture?
- Sure.

123
00:16:57,555 --> 00:17:02,034
- Could this be Pierce?
- We're still working on that.

124
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:09,202
Well, I only have the sketches to go by, so...

125
00:17:10,952 --> 00:17:14,873
Ectomorpheus, same basic phenotype.

126
00:17:16,591 --> 00:17:20,026
- Bottom line, could be him.
- I knew we couldn't leave her.

127
00:17:20,296 --> 00:17:23,897
Run a worldwide blind check on that face,
Bet you 10 quid there's no match.

128
00:17:24,337 --> 00:17:27,005
Okay, but what case number
do you want to book it under?

129
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:32,300
- Just run it.
- Do you really think it's Pierce?

130
00:17:32,456 --> 00:17:34,532
Run it.

131
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:45,217
Get me Italian Interpol.

132
00:17:57,546 --> 00:18:03,540
I have a strange feeling that those
two people over there are watching us.

133
00:18:11,336 --> 00:18:15,586
Do you know something?
I think you're right.

134
00:18:15,997 --> 00:18:18,368
Really?

135
00:18:23,324 --> 00:18:25,897
You're the paranoid, math teacher.

136
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,022
Memorize this face.

137
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:42,554
The train arrives in 10 minutes
Stop him when he descends.

138
00:19:00,767 --> 00:19:05,464
So, what are you doing all
alone in the city of lovers?

139
00:19:05,828 --> 00:19:08,232
Is there no one in your life?

140
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:14,785
- There was.
- What happened?

141
00:19:19,851 --> 00:19:24,988
- She left me.
- I'm sorry to hear that, Frank

142
00:19:34,401 --> 00:19:39,449
<i>Arrival at train station Venicia Santa
Lucia in 10 minutes. End of the line.</i>

143
00:19:45,504 --> 00:19:48,789
Guess I should go get my suitcase and stuff.

144
00:19:51,548 --> 00:19:58,542
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, thank you.

145
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,716
Oh shit.

146
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:49,644
- Sir.
- Wait.

147
00:20:51,703 --> 00:20:53,748
"Pick someone my height and build"

148
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:58,245
"And make them believe it's me"

149
00:21:01,204 --> 00:21:03,708
We did get an exact match.

150
00:21:03,969 --> 00:21:06,688
He's a math teacher at
Madson Community College.

151
00:21:06,693 --> 00:21:08,741
Frank Tupelo.

152
00:21:09,361 --> 00:21:11,991
Lost his wife in a car crash 3 years ago.

153
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:13,830
He's a tourist.

154
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:17,953
Thank you.

155
00:21:31,252 --> 00:21:32,510
Get me Italian Interpol.

156
00:21:47,826 --> 00:21:49,371
Yes?

157
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,917
Received.

158
00:21:58,949 --> 00:22:03,387
Abort. We go back to HQ quickly.

159
00:22:03,424 --> 00:22:04,927
On the other side.

160
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:55,271
- What are you doing?
- The Internet Fraud Report.

161
00:22:57,867 --> 00:23:01,318
So, this is what Alexander Pierce looks like?

162
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:04,359
It's above your clearance.
Get back to your work.

163
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:41,093
He's fluttering his eyelids
like a girl, that's his tell.

164
00:23:41,144 --> 00:23:43,245
Go all in.

165
00:23:45,478 --> 00:23:46,866
Damn.

166
00:23:52,448 --> 00:23:54,082
Yes?

167
00:23:54,086 --> 00:23:56,938
I have a piece of information for Mr. Shaw.

168
00:23:58,586 --> 00:24:01,646
It's concerning Alexander Pierce.

169
00:24:03,834 --> 00:24:07,169
Alexander Pierce has just arrived in Venice.

170
00:24:07,733 --> 00:24:09,171
With her.

171
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:18,068
- Aleri.
- Sir

172
00:24:18,273 --> 00:24:22,323
- Change of course. Venice.
- Yes, sir.

173
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:26,671
Now what do I own in Venice?

174
00:24:42,394 --> 00:24:44,242
Frank.

175
00:24:51,181 --> 00:24:52,702
Hi.

176
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,919
- Do you want to come with me?
- What?

177
00:24:59,552 --> 00:25:02,450
Oh yeah, sure, I mean,
I could use a lift, yeah.

178
00:25:03,441 --> 00:25:06,280
Thank you very... that's very kind.

179
00:25:42,765 --> 00:25:45,456
Welcome to Venice, Madam.

180
00:25:45,897 --> 00:25:47,486
Bags.

181
00:25:49,736 --> 00:25:51,771
Thank you.

182
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:56,190
Oh, uh, my bags!

183
00:25:56,782 --> 00:25:59,279
Are you coming?

184
00:26:04,574 --> 00:26:06,508
Thank you.

185
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:14,785
Hello, Welcome to Hotel Danieli, Madam.

186
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,316
Elise Clifton-Ward, and husband.

187
00:26:20,304 --> 00:26:22,980
We have arranged for you a wonderful suite...

188
00:26:23,752 --> 00:26:27,699
with bathroom and with...

189
00:26:29,562 --> 00:26:32,304
- May I have your documents, please?
- Yes

190
00:26:32,388 --> 00:26:34,386
Thank you.

191
00:26:35,561 --> 00:26:39,802
It will be my pleasure to show
you up personally. Please, this way.

192
00:26:39,804 --> 00:26:41,395
Thank you.

193
00:26:42,455 --> 00:26:46,035
- Enjoy your stay, sir.
- Thank you.

194
00:26:57,558 --> 00:27:00,381
Everything was arranged according
to the precise instructions.

195
00:27:00,873 --> 00:27:03,306
I very much hope you will not be disappointed.

196
00:27:03,537 --> 00:27:06,036
We are entering the Doches Suite.

197
00:27:06,488 --> 00:27:12,464
A room that has been a home away from
home for Marcel Proust and HonorÃ© de Balzac.

198
00:27:16,613 --> 00:27:19,640
- Have a nice day, sir.
- Thank you.

199
00:27:26,657 --> 00:27:28,529
Make yourself at home.

200
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:12,355
This really is a very nice hotel, isn't it?

201
00:28:13,571 --> 00:28:17,135
They think of everything, don't they?

202
00:29:21,992 --> 00:29:24,375
I know he will be with her.

203
00:29:24,383 --> 00:29:28,817
They'll be staying at one of the grand hotels.
The Pretty, The Regina, The Danieli.

204
00:29:28,874 --> 00:29:31,708
I want you to keep a watch on all of them.

205
00:29:32,067 --> 00:29:35,303
You can kill the girl, but you can't kill him.

206
00:29:36,956 --> 00:29:39,878
Not until I have my money, that is.

207
00:29:40,547 --> 00:29:44,052
- Is that clear?
- Let's go.

208
00:30:01,911 --> 00:30:06,025
- You're ravenous.
- Do you mean ravishing?

209
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,733
...I do.

210
00:30:07,734 --> 00:30:11,284
- You're ravenous.
- I am.

211
00:30:12,903 --> 00:30:14,013
Come on!

212
00:30:28,084 --> 00:30:33,219
- The Skambian champagne risotto, please.
- Excellent choice.... Excellent.

213
00:30:40,427 --> 00:30:45,916
He didn't say that to me.
Did he not like my choice?

214
00:30:45,951 --> 00:30:49,286
Your choice was excellent.

215
00:31:05,652 --> 00:31:07,860
Who is he?

216
00:31:09,516 --> 00:31:14,854
Hotels don't give gifts like that,
do they? Who is he?

217
00:31:16,229 --> 00:31:20,736
- He's someone who used to be very important to me.
- Used to?

218
00:31:23,374 --> 00:31:25,970
Are you meeting him in Venice?

219
00:31:26,869 --> 00:31:28,770
I hope so.

220
00:31:30,821 --> 00:31:34,331
- Part of me hopes I don't.
- Why?

221
00:31:37,482 --> 00:31:43,787
Because I don't like being told what to do.
I don't like being "summoned".

222
00:31:45,147 --> 00:31:48,941
But it felt even worse not
hearing from him for 2 years.

223
00:32:03,929 --> 00:32:09,330
It's the Roman god, Janus.

224
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:12,576
My mother gave it to me when I was little.

225
00:32:12,578 --> 00:32:17,384
She wanted it to teach me that people
have two sides; a good side, a bad side...

226
00:32:17,385 --> 00:32:20,665
Past and future.

227
00:32:22,663 --> 00:32:27,072
And that we must embrace
both in someone we love.

228
00:32:29,146 --> 00:32:31,136
And I tried...

229
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,896
What's he like?

230
00:32:45,813 --> 00:32:52,797
He's... different from anybody I know.

231
00:32:57,623 --> 00:33:00,467
Different's good.

232
00:33:01,914 --> 00:33:06,764
Where I come from the highest compliment...
that you can offer a person...

233
00:33:06,767 --> 00:33:10,800
Is to say that they're down to earth...
Grounded.

234
00:33:10,801 --> 00:33:15,248
I hate it.  Drives me nuts.

235
00:33:23,031 --> 00:33:26,258
Would you like another Americano?

236
00:33:27,168 --> 00:33:32,074
I don't know, would I?

237
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:39,074
It really was a very nice restaurant, wasn't it?
Oh. Very nice wine.

238
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:45,483
I'm making us a nice little drink.
Which is very nice of me, isn't it?

239
00:33:49,215 --> 00:33:50,554
Thank you.

240
00:33:50,556 --> 00:33:54,118
Were those flowers here
when we checked-in?

241
00:34:08,962 --> 00:34:12,920
It is an invitation to a Ball,
two nights from now.

242
00:34:15,696 --> 00:34:18,489
You've been "summoned"

243
00:34:18,491 --> 00:34:20,764
It appears I have.

244
00:34:58,574 --> 00:35:01,538
May I pay you a compliment?

245
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:05,599
Another question you need never ask.

246
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:14,623
You are the least down to
earth person I've ever met.

247
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:40,226
It's been a long day. I do hope
the couch will be comfortable.

248
00:35:41,392 --> 00:35:43,630
Good night.

249
00:39:09,901 --> 00:39:12,692
Excuse me, sir. Good morning.

250
00:39:12,695 --> 00:39:16,161
My name is Guido, your waiter.

251
00:39:16,163 --> 00:39:20,013
I'm Frank.  What's this?

252
00:39:20,015 --> 00:39:23,274
It's your breakfast, sir.

253
00:39:23,958 --> 00:39:29,382
- I didn't order any.
- The senora ordered it for you, when she left.

254
00:39:36,743 --> 00:39:38,984
She left?

255
00:40:03,983 --> 00:40:06,782
Have a nice day, sir.

256
00:40:36,396 --> 00:40:40,669
- Hi.
- Alexander, let's go see an old friend.

257
00:40:43,095 --> 00:40:46,964
- I'm not sure he's Pierce.
- The boss warned us about this.

258
00:40:46,967 --> 00:40:48,903
Get him!

259
00:41:03,111 --> 00:41:05,529
- Hello, please help.
- Hello, sir.

260
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:09,869
Hello. I need help. There are two
men trying to break down the door.

261
00:41:09,871 --> 00:41:13,120
I see, what kind of problem
do you have with the door, sir?

262
00:41:13,194 --> 00:41:18,206
No no no. There are two men
with guns trying to break in!

263
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:21,567
- Your spanish is excellent, sir.
- Thank you.

264
00:41:22,337 --> 00:41:24,734
- I gotta go!
- Sir?

265
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:29,279
Americans...

266
00:41:45,807 --> 00:41:48,038
The boss wants him alive!

267
00:41:57,633 --> 00:41:59,550
She's returned.

268
00:42:14,101 --> 00:42:15,735
Frank!

269
00:42:21,352 --> 00:42:23,694
Get ready to intervene.

270
00:42:26,763 --> 00:42:30,368
Commander Acheson, two armed men
are chasing the American from yesterday.

271
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:33,521
Shots have been fired.
Request permission to intervene.

272
00:42:33,523 --> 00:42:35,658
Do you still have Elise?

273
00:42:35,659 --> 00:42:40,836
We still have a visual on Elise Ward,
but the American is in imminent danger.

274
00:42:40,837 --> 00:42:44,944
You mean the mathematics teacher from Wisconsin?
I'd say not our mandate.

275
00:42:44,945 --> 00:42:47,613
Sir, this man is in real peril.

276
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:52,015
This is exactly why she chose him, to distract us.

277
00:42:52,017 --> 00:42:53,473
Stay with her.

278
00:42:53,474 --> 00:42:58,133
Do not move unless she moves.
Am I making myself crystal clear?

279
00:42:58,135 --> 00:43:01,901
Sir, they will kill him.

280
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:06,699
Not our mandate.

281
00:43:58,557 --> 00:44:01,763
- Look at that man!
- What the hell?

282
00:44:04,477 --> 00:44:07,887
Center, send someone to the market!

283
00:44:07,889 --> 00:44:12,315
There is a nut trying to kill himself.
American, I bet.

284
00:44:15,841 --> 00:44:17,781
Stop, stop!

285
00:44:22,096 --> 00:44:23,806
Do not jump!

286
00:44:36,432 --> 00:44:39,862
- I'm so sorry.
- Asshole!

287
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:43,093
I'm sorry!

288
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:46,542
- Stop him
- I'm sorry, sorry!

289
00:45:10,842 --> 00:45:13,938
- Answer the phone.
- Yes, sir.

290
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:33,230
- I think you need it more than I.
- "Thank you"

291
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:35,987
"You're welcome"

292
00:45:37,205 --> 00:45:39,011
Smoke?

293
00:45:42,012 --> 00:45:43,543
No?

294
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:01,135
- Now, you wish to report a murder?
- No.

295
00:46:01,946 --> 00:46:04,297
Some people tried to kill me.

296
00:46:04,299 --> 00:46:07,062
I was told you are reporting a murder.

297
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:09,572
Attempted murder.

298
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:16,707
- That's not so serious.
- No, not when you downgrade it from murder.

299
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:20,056
But when you upgrade it from room
service, it's quite serious.

300
00:46:20,057 --> 00:46:24,273
- So is assaulting a Police Officer.
- That was an accident.

301
00:46:24,275 --> 00:46:27,085
The officer feels differently.

302
00:46:28,498 --> 00:46:31,137
...With all due respect, sir.

303
00:46:31,138 --> 00:46:35,356
...I think maybe I should
be talking with someone.

304
00:46:36,246 --> 00:46:39,990
...Someone not Italian.

305
00:46:39,992 --> 00:46:44,329
- Like the Embassy, or Interpol.
- Interpol?

306
00:46:44,332 --> 00:46:47,037
I'm an American citizen.

307
00:46:47,916 --> 00:46:49,233
- What does that mean?
- I do not know.

308
00:46:49,236 --> 00:46:53,791
But I was involved in something here
and no offense, this is not a local issue.

309
00:46:53,792 --> 00:46:58,081
What is it you think you're involved in?

310
00:47:01,048 --> 00:47:06,333
It all started when I met a
woman on the train from Paris.

311
00:47:06,334 --> 00:47:09,020
- This already good!
- No, no.

312
00:47:09,023 --> 00:47:10,736
She took me to her hotel.

313
00:47:10,739 --> 00:47:13,615
- Ah, wonderful!
- No, no.

314
00:47:13,651 --> 00:47:16,593
She's involved with another man,
I think she's in love...

315
00:47:16,596 --> 00:47:20,639
- Sorry to hear that.
- I know.

316
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,888
...Anyway.

317
00:47:23,565 --> 00:47:29,404
This man, whatever his story is.
Some people are obviously trying to kill him.

318
00:47:30,512 --> 00:47:35,259
- How do you know this?
- Because they tried to kill me.

319
00:47:35,262 --> 00:47:38,050
- They tried to kill you?
- Yes!

320
00:47:38,052 --> 00:47:43,555
Because they must have
thought that I was him.

321
00:47:47,786 --> 00:47:51,786
- I like you Mr. Tupelo.
- I like you too, sir.

322
00:47:52,867 --> 00:47:57,013
But surely you understand
how strange this all sounds.

323
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,674
Come with me.

324
00:48:10,371 --> 00:48:12,991
Where are you taking me?

325
00:48:17,933 --> 00:48:20,768
Oh! You're going to lock me in there?

326
00:48:26,866 --> 00:48:31,750
Please don't do this.
Sir, I've done nothing wrong.

327
00:48:33,778 --> 00:48:37,829
- Please!
- It's only until I check some facts

328
00:48:42,526 --> 00:48:44,434
Hi.

329
00:48:56,354 --> 00:49:00,652
Your facts checked out.
We have to leave.

330
00:49:01,375 --> 00:49:05,802
- You're not safe here.
- I don't understand.

331
00:49:05,805 --> 00:49:09,330
This has to look right.

332
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:13,094
Come on.

333
00:49:15,668 --> 00:49:18,975
The man you're talking about is
called Alexander Pierce.

334
00:49:18,978 --> 00:49:21,912
...who stole big money from a gangster.

335
00:49:21,914 --> 00:49:25,076
They came to Venice to find him.

336
00:49:25,078 --> 00:49:27,764
They think you are him.

337
00:49:27,766 --> 00:49:34,750
They placed a... how do you say...
A bounty on your head.

338
00:49:35,235 --> 00:49:38,700
That's why you're not safe.

339
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:48,701
Wait here for a moment.

340
00:50:13,037 --> 00:50:16,304
You've come to buy a key?

341
00:50:26,713 --> 00:50:30,502
Brand new bills, I appreciate it.

342
00:50:37,953 --> 00:50:40,055
You think we cheat you?

343
00:50:40,056 --> 00:50:44,461
Of course not, I just enjoy counting

344
00:50:51,962 --> 00:50:56,818
Well, gentlemen,
Alexander Pierce is all yours.

345
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:06,754
Do not shoot him!

346
00:51:27,547 --> 00:51:29,991
I think we lost them!

347
00:51:29,992 --> 00:51:32,708
I'd really like to take these off!

348
00:51:32,712 --> 00:51:35,652
We have to wait until
we get to open waters

349
00:51:41,215 --> 00:51:43,181
Elise! Elise!

350
00:52:59,041 --> 00:53:00,335
Elise!

351
00:54:40,215 --> 00:54:44,548
It suits you perfectly, sir
You have a wonderful figure.

352
00:54:44,551 --> 00:54:51,112
- You think it's a little loose?
- No, it's of the utmost magnificence

353
00:54:57,881 --> 00:55:00,621
14 Red, bet made.

354
00:55:00,625 --> 00:55:02,964
Wager, sir?

355
00:55:05,046 --> 00:55:07,350
42 Red.

356
00:55:10,402 --> 00:55:13,716
- They're back.
- Yeah, bring them in.

357
00:55:13,719 --> 00:55:17,470
- I'll come back tomorrow?
- No, no, no, stay.

358
00:55:26,796 --> 00:55:29,518
We tried everything, sir

359
00:55:29,521 --> 00:55:33,661
- But he got away.
- So I heard, so I heard.

360
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:39,549
They're referring to the young man
who stole $2.3 billion dollars from me.

361
00:55:42,371 --> 00:55:44,544
You know, I worked very hard
for years so I wouldn't have to

362
00:55:44,547 --> 00:55:50,301
do the dirty work any more.
No more chasing traitors

363
00:55:50,303 --> 00:55:51,878
...No more killing.

364
00:55:53,046 --> 00:55:58,488
Now I employ people
to do those things for me.

365
00:55:58,490 --> 00:56:03,415
Except that you don't!

366
00:56:39,328 --> 00:56:42,814
- Does it look alright?
- Yes!

367
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,466
- Like always.
- What's always?

368
00:56:48,468 --> 00:56:51,947
Very good.

369
00:56:53,425 --> 00:56:54,872
Yes, I think it looks alright!

370
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:12,547
So thats how you pick a lock.

371
00:57:12,652 --> 00:57:15,881
How do you know how to do that?

372
00:57:18,431 --> 00:57:23,159
Wheres the owner of this boat?
Bottom of the canal?

373
00:57:23,161 --> 00:57:27,329
Sitting in a cafe with a pocketful of Euros.

374
00:57:28,669 --> 00:57:33,958
Why is this happening?
Why is everyone trying to kill me?

375
00:57:35,742 --> 00:57:38,869
Because I kissed you.

376
00:57:45,110 --> 00:57:48,811
Do I look that much like him?

377
00:57:51,448 --> 00:57:54,011
I am sorry I got you involved in all this.

378
00:57:54,013 --> 00:57:57,596
Why are you involved in all this?

379
00:57:59,007 --> 00:58:04,415
- Because I'm in love with him.
- Really? I'm not.

380
00:58:04,417 --> 00:58:06,997
...Seriously, help me understand why?

381
00:58:06,999 --> 00:58:10,486
I honestly didn't think
he would let it go this far.

382
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,772
I didn't think he would let Shaw get to you.

383
00:58:12,774 --> 00:58:17,918
Shaw - that's the man who Pierce stole from?

384
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:23,381
Reginald Shaw. Alexander used
to be his private banker.

385
00:58:23,383 --> 00:58:29,815
- I thought he was Russian or something like that.
- He surrounds himself with the Russians.

386
00:58:29,852 --> 00:58:32,833
But he's as English as Alex and I.

387
00:58:34,248 --> 00:58:36,654
Give me your hand.

388
00:58:37,041 --> 00:58:43,181
Now he owns most of the casinos and
brothels from here to Novus Brusk.

389
00:58:43,182 --> 00:58:47,568
Once, he bragged to Alexander
that he had every man killed.

390
00:58:47,571 --> 00:58:50,745
his wife had slept with
before she met him.

391
00:58:50,746 --> 00:58:55,610
And when he found out how many
there had been... he killed her too.

392
00:58:55,612 --> 00:58:57,777
There you are.

393
00:59:01,725 --> 00:59:05,888
What made Pierce think he
could take on a guy like that?

394
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:09,830
It's just who he is.

395
00:59:14,585 --> 00:59:18,828
Could you ever feel like about
that someone like me?

396
00:59:21,854 --> 00:59:28,792
I don't regret it, you know. Kissing you.

397
00:59:30,115 --> 00:59:35,279
I have to go check the... the thing...

398
00:59:56,156 --> 00:59:57,978
Where are we going?

399
01:00:18,548 --> 01:00:19,571
The airport?

400
01:00:21,187 --> 01:00:23,372
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

401
01:00:27,741 --> 01:00:29,077
Tie us up, would you?

402
01:00:44,679 --> 01:00:46,982
I wish we'd met in another life, Frank.

403
01:00:52,066 --> 01:00:54,709
Take the next flight back to America,
you'll find what you need in the bag.

404
01:00:57,772 --> 01:00:58,815
Be safe.

405
01:01:22,933 --> 01:01:24,456
But I'm in love with you...

406
01:02:47,595 --> 01:02:54,147
Agent Elise Clifton-Ward.
Identification number "MFS 98495 G"

407
01:03:27,403 --> 01:03:28,567
Elise Ward!

408
01:03:45,806 --> 01:03:47,980
Well, you're certainly
blowing your cover now.

409
01:03:48,648 --> 01:03:49,988
I'm ready to give you Pierce.

410
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:07,160
You're ready to give me Pierce?

411
01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:09,865
Well that's interesting.

412
01:04:09,962 --> 01:04:13,406
So you're aren't here to beg
me to lift your suspension?

413
01:04:14,345 --> 01:04:16,718
You've actually come to do your job?

414
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:21,455
Allow me to ask. Why now?

415
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:27,569
You live with a man for an entire year.

416
01:04:27,732 --> 01:04:31,929
During which time, we don't get
one single useable photograph.

417
01:04:33,067 --> 01:04:35,079
Now you're ready to give him up?

418
01:04:39,215 --> 01:04:41,785
It's because of that tourist, isn't it?

419
01:04:44,137 --> 01:04:46,737
I want to put an end to this
before someone gets killed.

420
01:04:58,803 --> 01:05:01,773
...I wish I could understand
your choice in men.

421
01:05:03,644 --> 01:05:06,649
...The fugitive thief?

422
01:05:06,773 --> 01:05:08,593
Well, that's exciting, perhaps.

423
01:05:10,526 --> 01:05:15,276
But a school teacher from Wisconsin?

424
01:05:16,632 --> 01:05:20,115
Who'd have thought your
tastes were so provincial?

425
01:05:21,270 --> 01:05:25,333
- Do you want Pierce or not?
- Yes

426
01:05:27,204 --> 01:05:29,814
I'm meeting him at a ball. Tonight.

427
01:05:31,578 --> 01:05:34,115
You know you'll have to wear a wire?

428
01:06:15,992 --> 01:06:17,472
Hello Madam.

429
01:06:49,669 --> 01:06:51,909
<i>She's heading toward the southeast corner</i>

430
01:07:02,149 --> 01:07:03,532
Where've you been?

431
01:07:05,977 --> 01:07:07,922
I thought you'd never get here.

432
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,644
Really?

433
01:07:11,992 --> 01:07:13,197
"So tell me"

434
01:07:14,726 --> 01:07:16,032
Is that our man?

435
01:07:17,426 --> 01:07:19,554
How could you be so sure I was coming?

436
01:07:20,893 --> 01:07:22,220
I just knew it.

437
01:07:23,995 --> 01:07:27,276
Fate wouldn't bring me to an
evening like this with no reason.

438
01:07:27,992 --> 01:07:31,495
As soon as you walked in,
I knew what the reason was.

439
01:07:34,817 --> 01:07:37,931
- No?
- No

440
01:07:44,005 --> 01:07:49,375
"Count Philipe Organza, land owner,
big reputation as a swordsman"

441
01:07:49,751 --> 01:07:51,882
Well, he won't be dueling tonight.

442
01:08:22,984 --> 01:08:24,418
Wait!

443
01:08:25,289 --> 01:08:26,379
Alexander!

444
01:08:27,203 --> 01:08:27,954
Excuse me.

445
01:08:28,063 --> 01:08:29,599
It's Pierce, he's here.

446
01:08:29,696 --> 01:08:32,801
He just left her an envelope.
Pull up the footage, we have his face.

447
01:08:36,314 --> 01:08:37,355
Alexander!

448
01:08:43,809 --> 01:08:44,954
Alexander!

449
01:08:47,934 --> 01:08:48,964
Frank!

450
01:08:51,686 --> 01:08:53,572
I don't bloody believe this!

451
01:08:53,712 --> 01:08:55,880
Alright, get that moron out of here.

452
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:59,870
You shouldn't be...
I can't, I'm sorry.

453
01:09:15,987 --> 01:09:18,724
Come on, you owe me a dance.

454
01:09:30,953 --> 01:09:31,991
You shouldn't be here.

455
01:09:33,042 --> 01:09:36,999
No, Elise.  This is the only
place on earth I should be.

456
01:09:43,992 --> 01:09:45,319
How did you get in here?

457
01:09:45,815 --> 01:09:47,198
I told the doorman, you're my wife.

458
01:09:47,310 --> 01:09:48,916
and I wanted to keep an eye on you.

459
01:09:49,316 --> 01:09:51,106
Italians are big on that kinda thing.

460
01:09:53,861 --> 01:09:55,960
- Leave.
- No.

461
01:10:02,459 --> 01:10:05,499
Do you like the suit?
You paid for it.

462
01:10:08,827 --> 01:10:11,336
I've been thinking about
your friend Pierce, and his plan.

463
01:10:12,097 --> 01:10:15,994
So far, I'm thinking it
hasn't worked out for him.

464
01:10:16,268 --> 01:10:17,280
No?

465
01:10:17,975 --> 01:10:20,902
No, take that gangster guy.

466
01:10:21,105 --> 01:10:22,849
- Shaw?
- Yeah, Shaw.

467
01:10:23,938 --> 01:10:28,684
I don't believe that Pierce was prepared
for him being here. The whole chase.

468
01:10:29,856 --> 01:10:31,241
Will you please leave?

469
01:10:35,335 --> 01:10:36,842
You're kinda worried about me, aren't you?

470
01:10:36,877 --> 01:10:37,874
Yes.

471
01:10:38,995 --> 01:10:40,005
And I'm worried about you

472
01:10:40,689 --> 01:10:42,930
Frank!

473
01:10:45,133 --> 01:10:46,611
And I'm not leaving without you.

474
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:54,181
You were part of the plan.
You were useful, that's all.

475
01:10:55,992 --> 01:10:59,022
Why do you think, I saw you on the
train and my heart stopped?

476
01:11:00,334 --> 01:11:01,563
Leave.

477
01:11:16,853 --> 01:11:17,994
This way please.

478
01:11:18,433 --> 01:11:20,392
Excuse me sir,
I think you've made a mista...

479
01:11:48,584 --> 01:11:49,847
What's it say?

480
01:11:55,216 --> 01:11:56,308
What's it say?

481
01:12:10,007 --> 01:12:11,672
Ms. Ward's boarding the boat.

482
01:12:13,899 --> 01:12:18,136
"It looks like they've called up
her boat, what should I do?"

483
01:12:18,205 --> 01:12:21,435
She may just be playing with us, let's wait.

484
01:12:26,918 --> 01:12:29,190
Fondamenta San Giacomo 23, please

485
01:12:29,726 --> 01:12:31,917
Okay, good.  We have the address.

486
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:33,955
I'm going to follow her on the boat.

487
01:12:34,098 --> 01:12:36,894
I want snipers on all surrounding roofs

488
01:12:36,995 --> 01:12:39,999
and if you get a visual on Pierce first, call.

489
01:13:03,663 --> 01:13:06,040
The Commissioner wants a report.

490
01:13:22,867 --> 01:13:23,864
Hello?

491
01:13:25,446 --> 01:13:27,113
Let's have a little fun with him

492
01:13:28,142 --> 01:13:29,227
Please?

493
01:13:34,009 --> 01:13:36,345
Who are you people?
Where are we going?

494
01:13:37,779 --> 01:13:42,747
Well, I don't know, Alexander.
Where are we going?

495
01:13:44,051 --> 01:13:47,809
I'm not Alexander,
my name's Frank Tupelo.

496
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:50,466
I'm an American citizen and I have rights.

497
01:13:50,590 --> 01:13:52,947
I don't care what you call
yourself these days.

498
01:13:53,579 --> 01:13:56,894
Your name's Alexander Pierce
and you have no rights.

499
01:13:57,259 --> 01:14:01,503
Not until you pay us
744 million pounds back taxes.

500
01:14:02,296 --> 01:14:04,670
744 million?

501
01:14:04,772 --> 01:14:07,111
Looks like someone else
is following our target.

502
01:14:11,866 --> 01:14:13,140
Reginald Shaw.

503
01:14:15,304 --> 01:14:16,458
Well, this could be fun.

504
01:14:16,939 --> 01:14:18,561
Alright, stay close but not too close.

505
01:14:18,655 --> 01:14:21,890
- And get the office to send me an interpreter.
- Right.

506
01:14:21,926 --> 01:14:24,927
Yes, 744 million.

507
01:14:25,737 --> 01:14:29,848
You didn't think we knew about that
bank account in Liechtenstein.

508
01:14:30,707 --> 01:14:32,387
I don't know what you are talking about.

509
01:14:32,525 --> 01:14:33,712
Listen...

510
01:14:34,414 --> 01:14:35,794
You asshole.

511
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:39,282
I know everything about you.

512
01:14:39,766 --> 01:14:41,855
I even know how much that face cost.

513
01:14:42,602 --> 01:14:44,824
24 million wired to a Brazilian surgeon.

514
01:14:44,952 --> 01:14:46,381
from a numbered Swiss bank account.

515
01:14:46,491 --> 01:14:47,673
I haven't been able to prove it.

516
01:14:49,125 --> 01:14:50,882
...But now I don't have to.

517
01:14:52,705 --> 01:14:55,437
...Because I just lock you
in a box in the basement.

518
01:14:55,538 --> 01:14:57,488
Until you tell me where the money is.

519
01:15:09,230 --> 01:15:10,321
It's alright.

520
01:15:10,849 --> 01:15:12,249
It's alright, Frank.

521
01:15:13,965 --> 01:15:15,919
I know you're not Alexander Pierce

522
01:15:16,707 --> 01:15:20,323
But you know who you are?
You're a moron.

523
01:15:20,941 --> 01:15:25,253
And you're a moron that almost
ruined my Â£8 million sting operation.

524
01:15:25,367 --> 01:15:26,797
Twice...

525
01:15:27,945 --> 01:15:30,346
So you're going to stay
here until this is all over.

526
01:15:30,468 --> 01:15:33,693
Please, you can't do this
I haven't done anything.

527
01:15:33,925 --> 01:15:35,465
I shouldn't be here.

528
01:15:36,057 --> 01:15:37,385
Know what I think?

529
01:15:38,241 --> 01:15:40,684
...I think that this is the one place on Earth

530
01:15:40,836 --> 01:15:42,892
You really should be.

531
01:15:48,090 --> 01:15:50,082
How was your night at the hotel?

532
01:15:51,761 --> 01:15:53,597
She's quite something, I'm sure.

533
01:15:53,925 --> 01:15:57,286
Target is about 200 yards
away from destination.

534
01:15:57,449 --> 01:15:59,187
- We are matching speed.
- Good.

535
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:00,824
But don't get too close.

536
01:16:01,895 --> 01:16:03,719
I don't want to scare Pierce off again.

537
01:16:13,870 --> 01:16:14,868
We're here.

538
01:16:21,218 --> 01:16:22,912
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

539
01:16:23,054 --> 01:16:25,201
I won't be needing you
any more this evening.

540
01:17:16,894 --> 01:17:18,436
Magnificent.

541
01:17:21,112 --> 01:17:25,861
I've never really understood the
love that people devote to each other.

542
01:17:26,581 --> 01:17:29,316
Money, yes. Possessions, yes.

543
01:17:29,476 --> 01:17:34,629
But people are so unreliable,
they sicken decay and die.

544
01:17:34,943 --> 01:17:38,524
But this, this is worth dying for.

545
01:17:57,155 --> 01:17:58,586
"...such good taste"

546
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:01,603
We're live.

547
01:18:06,197 --> 01:18:08,161
Oh, yes, do sit down.

548
01:18:09,807 --> 01:18:11,072
When are you going in?

549
01:18:11,464 --> 01:18:13,017
You're welcome to stay and watch.

550
01:18:13,155 --> 01:18:14,934
If you can keep your mouth shut.

551
01:18:15,274 --> 01:18:17,455
<i>You know, Alexander was like a son for me.</i>

552
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:19,820
I loved him.

553
01:18:20,753 --> 01:18:25,798
That brilliant playful disrespectful young bastard...

554
01:18:27,758 --> 01:18:30,072
I even thought he and I were two of a kind.

555
01:18:31,919 --> 01:18:36,003
I took great pleasure never knowing
what the scamp would do next.

556
01:18:38,162 --> 01:18:42,911
Until one day, what he did next...
didn't give me any pleasure at all.

557
01:18:45,097 --> 01:18:47,330
You know, in our quaint legal system...

558
01:18:47,423 --> 01:18:48,986
...When a man sleeps with my wife

559
01:18:49,091 --> 01:18:52,288
...I kill him and her and get away scot-free.

560
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:54,852
...Crime of passion as it was called.

561
01:18:55,275 --> 01:18:58,547
But my passion extends
to all the things I own

562
01:18:59,163 --> 01:19:03,152
They are me, they represent me.

563
01:19:03,663 --> 01:19:10,938
So if a man steals from me, I kill him.
I kill his wife, his children, his mother...

564
01:19:11,562 --> 01:19:14,456
...I might even throw in the
family doctor for good measure.

565
01:19:14,641 --> 01:19:18,657
For he has taken from me something
for which I have paid the infinite price.

566
01:19:19,655 --> 01:19:21,056
My Soul.

567
01:19:25,753 --> 01:19:29,166
Thats somethng these
idiots will never understand.

568
01:19:48,499 --> 01:19:49,912
He's not coming, is he?

569
01:19:52,858 --> 01:19:54,770
He sent you to get the money.

570
01:19:57,816 --> 01:20:03,752
So where is it?
Where is my money?

571
01:20:04,656 --> 01:20:08,529
- Where is the safe?
- I don't know.

572
01:20:09,029 --> 01:20:13,283
Where is the safe?

573
01:20:13,374 --> 01:20:14,880
I don't know.

574
01:20:14,975 --> 01:20:16,376
You don't know?

575
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:30,355
Is it behind this bookcase here?

576
01:20:37,284 --> 01:20:39,914
Or perhaps...

577
01:20:40,756 --> 01:20:41,879
...This one here.

578
01:20:55,732 --> 01:20:58,815
- Where is the safe?
- I don't know, I haven't seen him..

579
01:21:00,001 --> 01:21:01,133
Please, you have to do something.

580
01:21:01,169 --> 01:21:02,266
Permission to fire?

581
01:21:02,379 --> 01:21:03,422
Hold your fire. I repeat, hold your fire.

582
01:21:03,526 --> 01:21:06,516
Not until Pierce shows himself.

583
01:21:07,682 --> 01:21:09,487
You're very beautiful, Elise.

584
01:21:09,787 --> 01:21:12,367
Try to combine it with a little intelligence.

585
01:21:12,496 --> 01:21:16,446
- And tell me where the safe is.
- If I knew it, I would tell you.

586
01:21:19,222 --> 01:21:21,511
In my opinion she knows nothing.

587
01:21:22,939 --> 01:21:26,116
You have to go in.
They're gonna kill her.

588
01:21:26,241 --> 01:21:28,700
- Where's my interpreter?
- They're going to kill her.

589
01:21:29,027 --> 01:21:32,249
- She can handle herself.
- She can handle herself?

590
01:21:33,153 --> 01:21:34,602
She's one of us.

591
01:21:35,444 --> 01:21:37,853
Expert in undercover operations.

592
01:21:38,544 --> 01:21:40,860
When I sent her to Russia to find Pierce.

593
01:21:40,987 --> 01:21:42,416
She went dark.

594
01:21:43,109 --> 01:21:44,895
...I think she could never quite decide.

595
01:21:45,035 --> 01:21:46,977
If she was with him, or with us.

596
01:21:47,756 --> 01:21:49,267
She's a good agent.

597
01:21:49,534 --> 01:21:51,918
...Except that she invariably
falls in love with any man.

598
01:21:52,037 --> 01:21:54,467
That she spends longer
than a train ride with.

599
01:21:56,925 --> 01:21:58,703
Commander Acheson, I'm the interpreter.

600
01:21:58,811 --> 01:21:59,933
Yes, go!

601
01:22:09,853 --> 01:22:12,473
If you could provide
me with some context...

602
01:22:14,993 --> 01:22:17,358
She really doesn't seem...

603
01:22:18,076 --> 01:22:19,795
...To know where it is.

604
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:21,426
"We should go"

605
01:22:21,616 --> 01:22:23,666
We give it 5 more minutes.

606
01:22:23,795 --> 01:22:29,877
If Pierce doesn't show,
we get rid of the woman and go.

607
01:22:33,724 --> 01:22:36,392
- Permission to engage?
- Negative.

608
01:22:36,427 --> 01:22:38,734
- Please!
- Not one more word from you.

609
01:22:42,662 --> 01:22:44,009
They won't kill her.

610
01:22:45,309 --> 01:22:46,757
Pierce will come.

611
01:22:47,805 --> 01:22:49,183
He has to come.

612
01:22:50,394 --> 01:22:52,362
Well alright, let's do it.

613
01:22:53,611 --> 01:22:55,492
No, knife.

614
01:22:58,375 --> 01:22:59,663
"Engaging target"

615
01:22:59,804 --> 01:23:04,868
- Negative, that is an order.
- Order the shot.

616
01:23:05,071 --> 01:23:07,279
Now if you don't tell
me where the safe is

617
01:23:07,861 --> 01:23:12,014
I might be tempted to rearrange
your face somewhat.

618
01:23:22,104 --> 01:23:28,217
You'll find life is not quite
so giving to an ugly woman.

619
01:23:37,511 --> 01:23:39,237
You really don't know, do you?

620
01:23:50,015 --> 01:23:51,150
There!

621
01:23:55,043 --> 01:23:56,652
Behind the medallion, there!

622
01:24:35,973 --> 01:24:37,434
Open it.

623
01:24:42,215 --> 01:24:43,807
There is movement in the courtyard.

624
01:24:45,874 --> 01:24:47,256
Pierce, I knew it

625
01:24:52,083 --> 01:24:54,517
You know what, he
does look a little like you.

626
01:24:58,925 --> 01:25:00,093
No!

627
01:25:17,853 --> 01:25:19,500
Just try.

628
01:25:32,199 --> 01:25:34,111
Go on, press it.

629
01:25:37,034 --> 01:25:39,403
You may try one more time.

630
01:25:52,734 --> 01:25:53,801
Let her go!

631
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:57,617
Let her go!

632
01:25:58,099 --> 01:26:00,685
- You let her leave and I'll open the safe.
- Stop right there.

633
01:26:02,849 --> 01:26:05,307
Frank, what in hell?

634
01:26:05,434 --> 01:26:08,374
Please Elise, let me handle this.

635
01:26:09,142 --> 01:26:13,762
I'll say it again, let her go.
I'll open the safe.

636
01:26:13,967 --> 01:26:18,526
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Alexander Pierce.

637
01:26:18,697 --> 01:26:20,378
This is the man that
was driving the boat.

638
01:26:20,679 --> 01:26:23,571
- He is not Alexander Pierce.
- Elise, please.

639
01:26:23,913 --> 01:26:25,795
What the hell are you doing?

640
01:26:25,830 --> 01:26:26,995
What the hell is he doing?

641
01:26:27,157 --> 01:26:28,492
"Permission to engage target?"

642
01:26:28,599 --> 01:26:30,357
Shut the hell up.

643
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:37,692
Alexander, is it you?  Truly?

644
01:26:38,459 --> 01:26:39,746
Truly.

645
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:43,590
Show me your teeth.

646
01:26:45,927 --> 01:26:49,875
Alexander had crooked teeth
Stained from excessive smoking.

647
01:26:49,995 --> 01:26:52,965
Braces. Electronic cigarettes.

648
01:26:53,203 --> 01:26:55,286
He had a higher forehead.

649
01:26:56,515 --> 01:26:59,070
I had a migraine for
2 weeks after the remodel.

650
01:27:00,175 --> 01:27:03,351
- You sound different.
- Voice chip implant.

651
01:27:03,489 --> 01:27:05,650
No no, I mean the way you speak.

652
01:27:05,793 --> 01:27:09,480
Yes, that's right, Alexander was English.
This man is American.

653
01:27:12,186 --> 01:27:14,573
I've actually gotten so used
to the American accent.

654
01:27:14,676 --> 01:27:16,608
that I find it a tad difficult to go back.

655
01:27:17,359 --> 01:27:21,020
That's pathetic, this man
is not Alexander Pierce.

656
01:27:21,392 --> 01:27:23,270
He's a tourist!

657
01:27:25,018 --> 01:27:26,229
A tourist?

658
01:27:26,342 --> 01:27:29,264
Someone I happened to
sit next to on the train.

659
01:27:30,389 --> 01:27:31,755
How would a tourist...

660
01:27:32,348 --> 01:27:34,947
know that you killed every
man your wife ever slept with?

661
01:27:35,057 --> 01:27:36,534
I told him that.

662
01:27:36,707 --> 01:27:39,555
You told a tourist?

663
01:27:39,649 --> 01:27:42,685
Why would she do that?
It's absurd.

664
01:27:43,873 --> 01:27:48,058
Well, there's a simple way of finding out.

665
01:27:51,310 --> 01:27:54,160
- Open the safe.
- I've made you a deal.

666
01:27:55,191 --> 01:27:56,307
...When she's gone.

667
01:27:56,343 --> 01:27:57,424
What are you doing?

668
01:27:57,579 --> 01:27:59,319
...and I know she's safe.

669
01:27:59,555 --> 01:28:00,880
Then.

670
01:28:01,428 --> 01:28:03,694
Well, I'll make you an even better deal.

671
01:28:04,510 --> 01:28:06,219
Open the safe now...

672
01:28:06,779 --> 01:28:10,935
And I won't make you watch something
that you would never forget.

673
01:28:12,557 --> 01:28:13,799
Open it!

674
01:28:19,343 --> 01:28:20,666
I see.

675
01:28:21,957 --> 01:28:23,592
Now you see?

676
01:28:40,766 --> 01:28:43,974
- Sir?
- I know him, he'll come for her.

677
01:28:45,297 --> 01:28:46,586
I know him.

678
01:28:46,798 --> 01:28:48,215
He won't give her up now.

679
01:28:48,317 --> 01:28:49,561
<i>We must engage.</i>

680
01:28:49,691 --> 01:28:52,847
<i>Permission to engage, Sir</i>

681
01:28:53,457 --> 01:28:54,872
Sir...

682
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:29,826
He'll come for her. He'll come for her.
It doesn't make sense..

683
01:29:35,958 --> 01:29:37,116
Fire!

684
01:30:37,846 --> 01:30:40,839
- Are you alright?
- Yes.

685
01:30:41,257 --> 01:30:44,277
I want you to know your
suspension is lifted.

686
01:30:45,107 --> 01:30:46,301
Thank you, sir.

687
01:30:46,430 --> 01:30:50,101
And your employment is terminated,
effective immediately.

688
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:52,455
Thank you, sir

689
01:30:55,951 --> 01:30:58,365
<i>We got him, we got Alexander Pearce.</i>

690
01:30:58,489 --> 01:30:59,737
Where?

691
01:30:59,774 --> 01:31:03,053
<i><>i>On the vondameta, 300 meters
south of your location.</i>

692
01:31:21,092 --> 01:31:22,775
So, you love me?

693
01:31:32,385 --> 01:31:33,635
I do.

694
01:31:35,781 --> 01:31:39,282
How do you feel about
Alexander Pierce these days?

695
01:31:41,632 --> 01:31:44,763
I love him too, unfortunately.

696
01:31:48,515 --> 01:31:50,939
I may have a solution for you.

697
01:32:24,031 --> 01:32:25,689
Are you with me this time?

698
01:32:51,829 --> 01:32:52,868
C'mon, let him up.

699
01:32:54,861 --> 01:32:56,322
I'm just a tourist.

700
01:32:59,896 --> 01:33:01,320
Just a tourist.

701
01:33:02,208 --> 01:33:04,928
He said I might get
arrested at some point.

702
01:33:05,163 --> 01:33:06,216
What?

703
01:33:06,253 --> 01:33:09,676
But that you'd have to let me go
because you have nothing on me.

704
01:33:09,789 --> 01:33:10,798
Who?

705
01:33:11,078 --> 01:33:13,262
The man who's been
sending me these texts.

706
01:33:13,555 --> 01:33:14,627
Texts?

707
01:33:15,562 --> 01:33:16,887
And the money, of course.

708
01:33:22,833 --> 01:33:26,570
So let me get this straight
because I'm... a little confused.

709
01:33:26,816 --> 01:33:29,898
You recieve money from a
man you've never met before?

710
01:33:30,134 --> 01:33:34,935
Who sends you text messages telling
you just to show up somewhere?

711
01:33:35,334 --> 01:33:36,701
Well...

712
01:33:40,207 --> 01:33:41,794
Not just anywhere...

713
01:33:53,673 --> 01:33:54,744
Clear!

714
01:34:16,838 --> 01:34:19,532
774 million.

715
01:34:34,585 --> 01:34:36,330
- Sir, listen...
- We have our money, Acheson.

716
01:34:36,470 --> 01:34:38,088
But we don't have Pierce.

717
01:34:39,243 --> 01:34:42,355
The man is a criminal
wanted in 14 countries.

718
01:34:42,823 --> 01:34:45,456
But what is it he did?  Really?

719
01:34:46,014 --> 01:34:50,188
He stole the money from a gangster.
A dead gangster.

720
01:34:50,468 --> 01:34:52,445
And he has good taste in women.

721
01:34:53,286 --> 01:34:55,931
I can't say I don't wish him well.

722
01:35:35,776 --> 01:35:39,087
20 million dollars worth of plastic surgery...

723
01:35:39,747 --> 01:35:41,907
And that's the face you choose?

724
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:45,938
- Do you not like it?
- It'll do.
