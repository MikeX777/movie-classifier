Got it?

377
00:35:01,101 --> 00:35:03,838
What? Kill them?

378
00:35:06,106 --> 00:35:07,976
I can sneak out.

379
00:35:08,076 --> 00:35:09,844
They're knocked out already.

380
00:35:09,944 --> 00:35:11,846
Why should I kill them?

381

[growling]

382
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,953
[screaming] Why? Why? Why?

383
00:35:19,486 --> 00:35:21,889
Do you think I make the rules?

384
00:35:22,991 --> 00:35:25,827
It is the way it is.

385
00:35:26,761 --> 00:35:29,162
The rules are the rules.

386
00:35:29,262 --> 00:35:32,634
Don't ask stupid questions.

387
00:35:35,036 --> 00:35:39,473
Okay, and rule number three?

388
00:35:42,376 --> 00:35:44,912

My son would love you.

A bad conscience

456
00:43:22,436 --> 00:43:27,074
is worse than any curse, right?

457
00:43:30,878 --> 00:43:33,614
Come over, Martha.

458
00:43:35,783 --> 00:43:37,251

Please.

00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,309
I just want to go home.

464

00:44:47,656 --> 00:44:49,023
Ma'am.

You are serious, right?

00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,385
Sure I am.

472
00:45:19,353 --> 00:45:22,823
I just killed two guys
trying to win this game.

473
00:45:25,292 --> 00:45:26,360
And you...

474
00:45:32,333 --> 00:45:33,434
Please, ma'am.

475
00:45:36,036 --> 00:45:37,238
Please.

476
00:45:38,939 --> 00:45:40,975
Let me go home.

477
00:45:48,148 --> 00:45:49,216
No.

478
00:45:53,454 --> 00:45:57,024
I am so sorry, Martha.

479
00:45:57,758 --> 00:46:01,028
I am just a token in this game.

480
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:04,832
Same as you are.

481
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:09,270

484
00:46:20,881 --> 00:46:22,950
Not my game,

485
00:46:23,817 --> 00:46:26,086
not my rules.

486
00:46:27,955 --> 00:46:29,758
But if you let me,

487
00:46:31,726 --> 00:46:33,460
I'll help you a bit.

488
00:46:35,863 --> 00:46:37,431
Do you know...

489
00:46:40,401 --> 00:46:42,903
where your son is?

490
00:46:47,676 --> 00:46:51,478
He's waiting in his bed at home.

491
00:46:53,447 --> 00:46:54,448
[scoffs]

492
00:46:54,549 --> 00:46:56,083
At home?

493
00:46:56,518 --> 00:47:00,522
Martha, you can't follow, right?

494
00:47:02,691 --> 00:47:07,127
Look inside the ball.

495
00:47:12,399 --> 00:47:14,501
Okay, you know what?

496
00:47:17,438 --> 00:47:18,606
I'm leaving.

497
00:47:20,642 --> 00:47:25,412
Look inside the ball!

No.

506
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:06,920
No.

507
00:48:08,322 --> 00:48:09,657
This ain't true.

508
00:48:12,627 --> 00:48:14,995
What are you trying to suggest?

509
00:48:16,263 --> 00:48:20,367
To identify the truth,
inner place,

510
00:48:20,901 --> 00:48:24,606
where there is no reality
to prove.

511
00:48:25,673 --> 00:48:27,307
It's impossible.

512
00:48:30,077 --> 00:48:33,848
I don't know what you
and the Pink Rab...

And the pink fucker in the suit
are trying to tell me,

515
00:48:41,523 --> 00:48:43,390
but my son is at home.

516
00:48:45,693 --> 00:48:47,494
I've just talked to him.

517
00:48:49,363 --> 00:48:50,632
He's waiting.

518
00:48:53,434 --> 00:48:54,702
In his bed.

519
00:48:56,270 --> 00:49:01,308
Hell is an empty place.

520
00:49:02,911 --> 00:49:07,114
But future is in your hands.

521
00:49:08,115 --> 00:49:09,717
If you want,

522
00:49:11,686 --> 00:49:13,721
you can win.

523
00:49:14,656 --> 00:49:17,291
I don't want to play games.

524
00:49:17,991 --> 00:49:20,194
I'm leaving.

525
00:49:20,294 --> 00:49:24,364
I don't want to play your games.

526
00:49:34,007 --> 00:49:35,342
Fuck!

527
00:49:39,814 --> 00:49:41,583
Where is the door?

528
00:49:50,157 --> 00:49:53,595
Where is the door?!

529
00:50:06,006 --> 00:50:10,645
"Put trust in the power
of your mind."

530
00:50:23,558 --> 00:50:24,592
Oh!

531
00:50:25,125 --> 00:50:26,393
[Martha] Ah!

532
00:50:27,829 --> 00:50:29,898

Martha, listen.

536
00:50:44,211 --> 00:50:47,414
There is no way out of here.

537
00:50:49,517 --> 00:50:53,253
Except of death.

538
00:50:53,988 --> 00:50:56,123
Why me?

539
00:50:58,726 --> 00:51:02,496
Why me?!

540
00:51:07,334 --> 00:51:09,804
Because you have a reason.

541
00:51:09,904 --> 00:51:11,371
[Yanush] <i>Mommy!</i>

Okay.

What the f...

554
00:52:00,622 --> 00:52:03,992
You have to win
against yourself.

555
00:52:04,626 --> 00:52:09,597
Your inner obstacles,
your fears,

556
00:52:09,697 --> 00:52:11,799
your anger,

557
00:52:12,867 --> 00:52:16,604

and I just want
to go home to my son.

734
01:09:33,141 --> 01:09:34,942
How old is your son, Martha?

will figure out what happened.

to play games.

01:10:46,681 --> 01:10:47,749
No.

750
01:10:49,851 --> 01:10:51,485
You're wrong.

751
01:10:52,553 --> 01:10:54,589
I've just talked to him.

752
01:10:57,759 --> 01:10:59,761
Come on, Officer.

753
01:10:59,861 --> 01:11:01,796
There must be a mistake.

754
01:11:27,889 --> 01:11:29,056
Martha.

755
01:11:30,258 --> 01:11:31,659
Your son is dead.

756
01:11:32,994 --> 01:11:34,294
He got hit by this woman.

757
01:11:34,394 --> 01:11:35,506
She was hunting around
for a mobile phone

758
01:11:35,530 --> 01:11:37,098
on the car floor while driving,

759
01:11:37,198 --> 01:11:38,933
instead of looking at the road.

760
01:11:39,399 --> 01:11:41,401
Her name was Miss Brown.

761
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:46,941
No.

762
01:11:47,909 --> 01:11:49,777
No, no, no.

763
01:11:49,877 --> 01:11:52,613
Mr. Brown is my boss.

764
01:11:55,283 --> 01:11:57,450
And my son is alive.

765
01:11:57,552 --> 01:11:59,554
I've just talked to him.

766
01:12:00,487 --> 01:12:03,456
Just before I met the Pink Rab...

767
01:12:08,830 --> 01:12:11,732
The guy wearing
a pink rabbit beanie.

768
01:12:22,810 --> 01:12:26,013
I know there are a lot of people
named Brown in this world.

769
01:12:26,547 --> 01:12:28,950
It must be hard for you
seeing this name every day.

770
01:12:29,050 --> 01:12:31,586
But nevertheless,
your son is dead, Martha.

771
01:12:33,654 --> 01:12:35,833
You're divorced, living in
a one flat room in Dark Lake.

772
01:12:35,857 --> 01:12:38,391
And that night after,
you killed four people.

773
01:12:40,027 --> 01:12:41,863
Four people and a black cat.

774
01:12:48,202 --> 01:12:51,438
[laughing]

775
01:12:55,509 --> 01:12:59,814
<i>I</i> killed four people?

776
01:13:02,183 --> 01:13:03,851
Stop playing.

777
01:13:04,484 --> 01:13:06,020
Stop playing, Martha.

778
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:09,123
I know you're trying to play
the legal insane card,

779
01:13:09,690 --> 01:13:11,424
but it won't work with me.

780
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:18,165
You killed four people, not to
speak of the poor little cat.

781
01:13:20,902 --> 01:13:26,173
This little black kitty
looked like Mr. Jenkins.

782
01:13:27,141 --> 01:13:29,076
Mr. Jenkins.

783
01:13:30,678 --> 01:13:32,580
[Martha] Mr. Jenkins?

784
01:13:33,446 --> 01:13:36,784
Mr. Jenkins was the name
of the swineherd

785
01:13:37,285 --> 01:13:39,053
Caleb and Kain killed.

786
01:13:40,487 --> 01:13:41,722
Caleb and Kain?

787
01:13:41,822 --> 01:13:44,091
And a swineherd
called Mr. Jenkins?

788
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:45,626
Are you kidding me?

789
01:13:46,459 --> 01:13:49,997
Yes. They ate his liver.

790
01:13:55,670 --> 01:13:57,705
Do you mean these two guys?

791
01:13:58,906 --> 01:14:00,007
Yes.

792
01:14:01,609 --> 01:14:03,077
They are cannibals.

793
01:14:03,945 --> 01:14:05,246
Caleb and Kain.

794
01:14:05,713 --> 01:14:08,883
They pretended to live in 1866.

795
01:14:10,284 --> 01:14:11,819
They tried to eat me.

796
01:14:13,788 --> 01:14:16,023
I didn't want to kill them.

797
01:14:16,123 --> 01:14:17,792
It was not my fault.

798
01:14:19,226 --> 01:14:22,730
The rabbit guy made me do it.

799
01:14:24,899 --> 01:14:26,100
He said,

800
01:14:28,669 --> 01:14:30,871
it's the only way out.

801
01:14:32,039 --> 01:14:34,075
Cannibals? The rabbit?

802
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:37,645
Come on.

803
01:14:39,547 --> 01:14:41,315
Kain was a hardworking farmer.

804
01:14:41,415 --> 01:14:43,084
Everybody in this area
knew them.

805
01:14:43,184 --> 01:14:44,251
They were good guys.

806
01:14:44,352 --> 01:14:45,619
His son is...

807
01:14:46,187 --> 01:14:47,555
How do you say it?

808
01:14:48,289 --> 01:14:49,724
Mentally challenged.

809
01:14:51,125 --> 01:14:53,861
[Martha] Yes, because
of the great famine.

810
01:14:55,663 --> 01:14:56,998
What famine?

811
01:14:58,532 --> 01:15:01,501
That's why Kain
had a wooden leg.

812
01:15:02,536 --> 01:15:05,873
He fed it to Caleb
and his younger son,

813
01:15:06,474 --> 01:15:10,211
and his wife, Karen,
to try to save them.

814
01:15:12,046 --> 01:15:13,214
But he couldn't.

815
01:15:14,715 --> 01:15:17,718
After they died, they ate them.

816
01:15:22,123 --> 01:15:23,224
What the...

817
01:15:23,891 --> 01:15:27,228
His wife and younger son died
in a fire a couple of years ago.

818
01:15:28,696 --> 01:15:31,665
He lost his leg and Caleb
had a rare genetic defect,

819
01:15:31,766 --> 01:15:35,036
and there were all alternative
weekend farmers.

820
01:15:35,403 --> 01:15:36,437
Look at them.

821
01:15:36,537 --> 01:15:38,172
Look what you did.

822
01:15:44,478 --> 01:15:45,780
No.

823
01:15:47,715 --> 01:15:49,817
It was the rabbit guy.

824
01:15:51,385 --> 01:15:55,022
The guy with the pink beanie.

825
01:15:57,825 --> 01:16:00,227
Oh, the pink beanie.

826
01:16:04,465 --> 01:16:05,833
[door opens]

827
01:16:06,667 --> 01:16:08,469
[cart rolling]

828
01:16:08,569 --> 01:16:09,837
[door shuts]

829
01:16:20,214 --> 01:16:21,615
This is Madam Martita.

830
01:16:21,715 --> 01:16:23,851
She's travelling around
with the Boston fair.

831
01:16:24,652 --> 01:16:27,021
Now, watch what happens to her.

832
01:16:34,361 --> 01:16:35,663
[Madam Martita screaming]

833
01:16:35,763 --> 01:16:37,532
[Martha] <i>Get that. Get down.</i>

834
01:16:37,631 --> 01:16:40,734
<i>Where's my son? Where is he?</i>

835
01:16:40,835 --> 01:16:42,603
<i>Where's my son?</i>

836
01:16:44,271 --> 01:16:45,906
[Madam Martita screaming,
gunshot firing]

837
01:17:04,125 --> 01:17:05,759
[Martha exhaling]

838
01:17:09,997 --> 01:17:13,067
The pink rabbit guy pretty
much looks like you, Martha.

839
01:17:14,468 --> 01:17:15,736
What do you think?

840
01:17:17,371 --> 01:17:18,639
Officer.

841
01:17:19,473 --> 01:17:21,543
I know that sounds weird,

842
01:17:21,642 --> 01:17:24,945
but something wrong
is going on here.

843
01:17:25,946 --> 01:17:30,585
I've had a fight with
two cannibal trying to eat me.

844
01:17:31,085 --> 01:17:33,487
I've confronted
the fortune teller

845
01:17:33,588 --> 01:17:35,022
with telekinetic powers,

846
01:17:35,122 --> 01:17:39,561
and a huge mutant brain
under her head scarf

847
01:17:39,693 --> 01:17:44,365
owned by a black cat,
both trying to kill me.

848
01:17:47,501 --> 01:17:48,836
And then,

849
01:17:49,870 --> 01:17:53,908
there was this old dude
under the pergola.

850
01:17:57,778 --> 01:17:59,246
Is he dead?

851
01:18:01,616 --> 01:18:05,753
The janitor of the Fourth Street
Elementary School, Mr. Zeit?

852
01:18:06,555 --> 01:18:08,122
He was such a good guy.

853
01:18:09,690 --> 01:18:12,393
Oh, my God, Officer.

854
01:18:14,328 --> 01:18:15,396
I...

855
01:18:19,066 --> 01:18:22,436
I thought he made
my son disappear.

856
01:18:25,005 --> 01:18:28,742
This crazy one-piece guy

857
01:18:31,278 --> 01:18:34,048
is playing an evil game.

858
01:18:37,051 --> 01:18:41,121
He puts up all these
monsters against me.

859
01:18:41,855 --> 01:18:45,092
They're all on his side.

860
01:18:47,228 --> 01:18:48,462
Martha,

861
01:18:49,296 --> 01:18:52,099
you a graduate of
the Boston School of Law,

862
01:18:52,199 --> 01:18:54,735
and a lawyer at a big legal firm

863
01:18:54,835 --> 01:18:56,403
and if we believe your
medical records,

864
01:18:56,503 --> 01:18:58,739
you're suffering from nothing
than depression,

865
01:18:58,839 --> 01:19:01,041
and you're taking nothing
but anti-depressants.

866
01:19:01,141 --> 01:19:04,979
So, you're an average
American citizen.

867
01:19:05,079 --> 01:19:07,982
Stop playing and confess.

868
01:19:10,050 --> 01:19:13,087
[Martha] No, officer.

869
01:19:13,821 --> 01:19:18,092
I swear, I am not a killer.

870
01:19:21,829 --> 01:19:25,600
I see. This is going
to be a long night.

871
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:30,237
Todd? Todd? Todd!

872
01:19:31,338 --> 01:19:33,541
I have to do everything
by my own.

873
01:19:40,715 --> 01:19:43,984
[rock music playing
on headphones]

874
01:19:49,256 --> 01:19:50,791
Just what you attention-craving

875
01:19:50,891 --> 01:19:52,727
wannabe rock-stars
are getting paid to do?

876
01:19:53,327 --> 01:19:56,130
Eating donuts and listening to
subversive punk rock bands,

877
01:19:56,230 --> 01:19:58,700
dreaming of a radical new world,

878
01:19:58,799 --> 01:20:01,736
while your dad to whom you have
a questionable relationship

879
01:20:01,835 --> 01:20:03,605
forces you to join the enemy?

880
01:20:04,238 --> 01:20:07,041
You should either
grow yourself a pair of balls

881
01:20:07,141 --> 01:20:10,010
and tell your beloved daddy
that you hate this job

882
01:20:10,110 --> 01:20:13,247
and the police and join
an un... underground movement

883
01:20:13,347 --> 01:20:17,151
to play revolution with a couple
of reckless boys like yourself.

884
01:20:17,251 --> 01:20:21,989
Or you should grow up and do
your job like a responsible men.

885
01:20:23,525 --> 01:20:24,592
Fuck!

886
01:20:25,292 --> 01:20:26,561
You wait.

887
01:20:28,962 --> 01:20:30,230
[door closes]

888
01:20:31,965 --> 01:20:34,401
As if I have another chance.

889

[rock music continues to play]

890

[suspenseful music]

891
01:21:38,031 --> 01:21:40,635
No, Pumpkin Yanush.

892
01:21:44,839 --> 01:21:47,341
I know you're waiting.

893
01:21:48,843 --> 01:21:50,612
Waiting at home.

894
01:21:52,012 --> 01:21:55,115
Waiting in your little bed.

895
01:21:58,185 --> 01:22:02,489
Waiting for mommy
to come to tuck you in.

896
01:22:04,859 --> 01:22:06,960
And give you a little kiss

897
01:22:09,997 --> 01:22:12,166
onto your forehead.

898
01:22:14,769 --> 01:22:17,605
So you can ease your pain,

899
01:22:22,009 --> 01:22:24,945
and all the worries
in your head,

900
01:22:29,651 --> 01:22:31,084
knowing

901
01:22:32,887 --> 01:22:34,656
that you're safe.

902
01:22:38,726 --> 01:22:42,196
Knowing that mommy is around,

903
01:22:42,296 --> 01:22:44,331
and you are not alone.

904
01:22:52,774 --> 01:22:55,142
I'll be around, my love.

905
01:22:56,744 --> 01:22:59,379
I will be there.

No.

No.

914
01:23:39,621 --> 01:23:42,022
No, no.

01:23:52,734 --> 01:23:54,101
I am not

916
01:23:55,637 --> 01:23:59,206
going to lose my mind.

I am Martha O'Hare.

I am not a mass killer.

921
01:24:42,984 --> 01:24:47,421
I am married to my best friend.

922
01:24:50,324 --> 01:24:54,294
And my son is alive,

923
01:24:55,730 --> 01:24:57,732
waiting at home,

924
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:03,470
because I promised
to be there on time.

925
01:25:06,975 --> 01:25:09,209
And there is no way

926
01:25:09,309 --> 01:25:13,581
I am going to disappoint him!

927
01:25:15,817 --> 01:25:19,887
I am not

928
01:25:21,254 --> 01:25:26,226
going to lose my mind.

929
01:25:31,465 --> 01:25:33,101
I know

931
