2
00:00:46,069 --> 00:00:50,309
I want to tell a story
that changed my life.

3
00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:53,149
It happened on the island gradskiyat Zora ..

4
00:00:53,229 --> 00:00:56,829
Ogkrit ... French corsair
in the 17th century

5
00:00:57,069 --> 00:01:00,229
Winter here is like paradise.

6
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:04,869
Today Zora is a
small village ..

7
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:09,189
All ... where life revolves
proshtada around in the cafeteria "Aristotle."

8
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:10,989
You all know ...

9
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:13,149

... Between my parents,
Demosthenes and Antonia.

13

And the day of their wedding
when my father gave my mother ...

00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:32,029
Family ... a gold cross.

15
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:39,349
When my mother died,
Golden Cross was mine.

16
00:01:46,989 --> 00:01:48,389
And I say Janis ...

17
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:51,949

Pedaling! ..

19
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:08,309
There is a divine sight
but to move the legs is useful!

20

Stop grumbling! ..
The biggest climb yet!

24
00:02:19,749 --> 00:02:22,029
If you have enough forces
just wait.

25
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:22,989

26
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:25,469

Drive slower, Father Kosmas,

33
00:02:51,149 --> 00:02:53,949
This year proved only weaklings.

34
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:56,869
So then you also
"Great land" are you going?

Where was gone! ..
But that naglets.

60
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:46,989
Want to drink ...
It is clear as day.

61
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:48,469
Where is water?

62
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:51,709
Let's get out ... Did brandy?
- Yes, that is behind the door

63
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:55,949
Smuggler you? ..
I thought it would be any greater.

64
00:05:56,069 --> 00:05:58,469
What is smuggling??
It's fat brandy.

65
00:05:58,589 --> 00:05:59,989
For you 60 euros.

66
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:06,349
From where did you bird? ..
That I have not seen.

67
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:09,989
From Cuba ...
Here hold and get out of here.

68
00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:13,629
Give me this bird.

69
00:06:17,149 --> 00:06:18,709
I'm not stupid!

70
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:23,629
I wear it for a client ...

71
00:06:25,869 --> 00:06:28,069
The bird is not home.
- How?

72
00:06:30,549 --> 00:06:32,109
Sixty euros.

73
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:36,869
My father would beat me
if not give him money.

74
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:39,429
And what is this cross on your neck?

75
00:06:41,989 --> 00:06:43,909
Okay? ..
Will it be enough?

76
00:06:43,989 --> 00:06:47,949
Well .. Is it gold?
- Of course it is golden ...

77
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:53,109
My mom is ..
She died three years ago.

78
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:58,949
And get ready to swap it for this
plucked bird?

79
00:06:59,749 --> 00:07:01,949
I like plucked birds.

80
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:04,989
Are not you afraid that your father
will disconnect when out?

81
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:06,349
You will not understand.

82
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:10,549
I'll tell him not to move
Thai and not felt.

83
00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:21,589
So what better than a cell is? ..
But we must also Chairman hide.

84
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:24,349
My father was not home animals suffer.

85
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:29,589
I often think
if I'm doing the right thing then

86
00:07:29,789 --> 00:07:33,549
Was it not folly to exchange
Mama's Cross ...

87
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:35,949
... For some kind of stinking bird?

88
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:41,229
Damn! ..
My father is back!

89
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:44,469
But somehow I was sure
that my mother will forgive me ..

90
00:07:44,549 --> 00:07:49,109
I traded ... family relic
to preserve this beautiful bird ...

91
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:52,189
But my father? ...
that's another story.

92
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:03,309
Hi, Kitsa!

93
00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:09,909
Do not run ...
You must help her father.

94
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,349
Sit quietly ...

95
00:08:11,549 --> 00:08:15,589
Kitsa, get ...
Go walk.

96
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:27,229
Enjoy ...
Today was not going fishing.

97
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:40,389
Looking so there?
- Kitsa, go away! ..

98
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:43,109
Who can know ...
You may insolation.

99
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:46,669
A tank?
- Oh, I forgot ... Excuse.

100
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:49,549
What are you my apologies!

101
00:08:55,189 --> 00:08:57,549
Do not forget that the network will be towels.

102
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:12,349
Kitsa! .. go away! ..
Run ... get out of here ...

103
00:09:13,229 --> 00:09:15,549
This miracle is called with goat horns.

104
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:18,389
Stupid is
but her milk is delicious ...

105
00:09:18,469 --> 00:09:20,789
In time it will get used to.

106
00:09:22,989 --> 00:09:25,709
Lay your head,
're prigladnyalo much.

107
00:09:25,909 --> 00:09:27,789
Here's your bread with milk.

108
00:09:30,309 --> 00:09:31,949
What are you so ...

109
00:09:32,349 --> 00:09:35,989
This M. .. beak of a swan ...
feet of a duck ...

110
00:09:37,669 --> 00:09:41,269
neck with a frog ...

111
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:44,949
Eat!

112
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:51,989
Delicious!

113
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:58,189
Hai De, smell it well ...

114
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:02,589
This is a bird and you - a goat ...
Jealous.

115
00:10:07,109 --> 00:10:12,069
I will wear it for the gold ...
if you do not understand - I'm not lazhech ...

116
00:10:12,989 --> 00:10:17,149
Come, rest in peace ...
Do not be afraid, my father will not come here.

117
00:10:23,549 --> 00:10:26,509
Oh! ..
Have a strong beak.

118
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,109
Hey! ..
Okay!

119
00:10:28,909 --> 00:10:30,189
You want to eat it?

120
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:34,429
Tomorrow, after my father went into the sea
will feed you ...

121
00:10:34,909 --> 00:10:36,629
Now a quiet ...

122
00:10:36,789 --> 00:10:39,669
If they find my father -
and they will beat us.

123
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:41,829
Better not to irritate.

124
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:46,029
Lie.

125
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:09,309
You are sea dweller, I knew ...
I will baptize with the name of the ship.

126
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:11,989
Nikostratos ...
Great, huh!

127
00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:13,589
Nikostratos.

128
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:21,309
Needless to say,
that the bird is quite unusual ...

129
00:11:21,429 --> 00:11:22,949
Such an inflexible.

130
00:11:23,109 --> 00:11:25,669
An interesting and touching.

131
00:11:25,749 --> 00:11:28,029
Wonder what kind is it?

132
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:34,469
Some cross between an ostrich and a dog ...
Or swan suffering from laryngitis ...

133
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:37,869
To explain this puzzle
Only one man can ...

134
00:11:38,189 --> 00:11:39,589
Father Kosmas.

135
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:44,669
Monk where he did not look like a monk
who knows everything about birds.

136
00:11:45,109 --> 00:11:49,469
Good morning, Holy Father!
- Hey, Janis.

137
00:11:50,189 --> 00:11:53,229
I need a Father Kosmas.
- Once you? .. Or then?

138
00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:55,949
As soon as ...
I will show him something.

139
00:11:56,109 --> 00:11:57,589
Well ...
Let's go.

140
00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:02,269
Octopus spews
black ink cloud ..

141
00:12:02,349 --> 00:12:05,109
Ink ... which is
here in this bag ...

142
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:08,589
We will not allow losses
the valuable liquid ..

143
00:12:08,989 --> 00:12:11,549
... And would do so here
and tampered with our rice ...

144
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:15,509
See how simple it is ...
What an amazing color!

145
00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:23,589
Well, enough now harder.

146
00:12:23,789 --> 00:12:29,029
Rice with octopus brothers is very
food dish, rich in protein.

147
00:12:29,789 --> 00:12:33,269
And if you add
and a few glasses of wine ...

148
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:35,309
That is food for the gods.

149
00:12:36,229 --> 00:12:38,309
Janis, very early today.

150
00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:43,389
Come, friends, places ...
So, what do you show me?

151
00:12:43,469 --> 00:12:44,749
A bird.

152
00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:47,949
Oh, and what is this bird?
- I do not know ...

153
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:50,629
This brought it to you ...
Hey now ...

154
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:52,829
Take a look.

155
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:57,429
A! ..
This is Pelekanus Onokrotalus!

156
00:12:58,429 --> 00:12:59,389
What?

157
00:12:59,469 --> 00:13:03,869
Pelekanus Onokrotalus, it is
Latin name of Pink Pelican.

158
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:05,869
Who gives it?

159
00:13:06,109 --> 00:13:09,629
A bad man ...
Tormented him.

160
00:13:10,109 --> 00:13:13,669
Well, you gave it your ...
Not seem so bad.

161
00:13:13,789 --> 00:13:17,429
Nisho not give away my ...
I had to give him something in return.

162
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:19,949
So what?
- His cross.

163
00:13:20,749 --> 00:13:24,909
This was where your mother?
- Not very well know.

164
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:33,269
Received his noble ...
Replacing its okrashenie for being ...

165
00:13:33,349 --> 00:13:34,909
The birds grow quickly.

166
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:39,429
And in case you want to know
Pelicans reached five feet.

167
00:13:39,549 --> 00:13:40,709
In the wingspan?

168
00:13:40,789 --> 00:13:44,149
No, no - in height ...
This is a huge bird!

169
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:49,029
Now let h ...

170
00:13:54,109 --> 00:13:56,229
It turned a giant bird!?

171
00:13:56,349 --> 00:14:00,589
Come on children, their water pipe
remove and notebooks ...

172
00:14:03,349 --> 00:14:06,109
Kitsa! ..
But that goat!

173
00:14:09,669 --> 00:14:11,349
Wow, now eight!

174
00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:18,349
Sleep my friend ...
I go out, but will be back.

175
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:32,509
Fruits are very tasty!
- I do not want ...

176
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:34,229
It is delicious, it is delicious!

177
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:38,109
Good morning, Mrs. Karusos.
- Good, Janis!

178
00:14:38,229 --> 00:14:41,309
And you think this cucumber? ..
This is a small gherkin!

179
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:44,189
Your vegetables are shriveled in fear
Christina!

180
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:48,389
You know what, Father Kosmas,
if you like - go to Kiki.

181
00:14:48,509 --> 00:14:51,429
Hello, Aristotle!
- Hey, Janis!

182
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:06,789
And when you nothing! ..
And you do not have squid?

183
00:15:07,069 --> 00:15:10,229
Well my mock ...
Thank you for refreshing me.

184
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:11,589
As always polite.

185
00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:15,069
No wonder fish
they shun.

186
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:28,749
The cheese alone I do it?
- Not just me ...

187
00:15:28,869 --> 00:15:30,389
Goat also helps.

188
00:15:30,549 --> 00:15:35,229
For cheese milk gives me,
and for vegetables - fertilizer.

189
00:15:35,429 --> 00:15:36,709
Janis, hello!

190
00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:39,589
This is cheese! ..
Fresh goat cheese!

191
00:15:39,669 --> 00:15:43,349
Hello Demosfen! ..
What are you wearing?

192
00:15:43,469 --> 00:15:45,629
Working overalls.
- Download it ...

193
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:47,869
With overalls is not traded.

194
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,869
Demosfen, what ...
You scare people!

195
00:15:49,989 --> 00:15:51,949
Kokvo?
- Goal you will trade!

196
00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:54,789
Before you give advice
why not put it gracefully ..

197
00:15:54,909 --> 00:15:56,869
Better ... to have seen
in the mirror!

198
00:15:56,989 --> 00:16:00,149
Do not boil your nose ...
Educate his son as you want ...

199
00:16:00,229 --> 00:16:04,149
Got it? ..
And you understand? .. A?

200
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:12,909
Swine his Demosfen, pig!

201
00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:30,509
When my mother died,
My father changed ...

202
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:34,229
Sometimes silent for days.

203
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:38,189
Luckily I already have a friend.

204
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:40,549
I decided to put my Nikos
in the annexe, ..

205
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:45,189
Entrance ... and slashed in their room
for better movement.

206
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:46,629
Grow quite rapidly.

207
00:16:46,749 --> 00:16:50,269
And every day it became
stronger and more beautiful.

208
00:16:50,349 --> 00:16:53,709
Island life
obeyed the seasons ...

209
00:16:53,989 --> 00:16:57,589
Fall gathered mushrooms
winter chestnuts.

210
00:16:58,069 --> 00:16:59,349
Come on, girls ...

211
00:16:59,509 --> 00:17:03,629
Gladly accept all
generous gifts of nature.

212
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:13,709
This is for you, Father Alexius.
- Thank you.

213
00:17:14,029 --> 00:17:16,029
Nikos also enjoyed life.

214
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:19,629
But hiding it became
harder and harder.

215
00:17:19,749 --> 00:17:22,909
Quiet right, quiet! ..
What a glutton've become.

216
00:17:31,389 --> 00:17:33,069
Give me a hug ...

217
00:17:35,829 --> 00:17:38,469
We work a little, then play.

218
00:17:47,389 --> 00:17:50,189
I need a new pump ...
I will write you a letter?

219
00:17:50,389 --> 00:17:51,949
Of course.

220
00:17:53,269 --> 00:18:00,069
First the address: "George Karbunis ...
Motor Boat "Piraeus" ...

221
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:04,829
What is it?
- Nothing.

222
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:10,309
"Athens, the port area" ...

223
00:18:11,109 --> 00:18:14,949
I bike "YANMAR"
48 horsepower. "

224
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:20,429
Mo-tor ...
Ian ... Jan-Mar ...

225
00:18:22,949 --> 00:18:24,669
UAA-chezvay!

226
00:18:26,829 --> 00:18:29,469
48 horsepower.

227
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:33,549
What's up?
- Meaning?

228
00:18:35,509 --> 00:18:39,549
Break the fuel pump is ... ...

229
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:42,109
Get out! .. Quick! .. Shoo! ..
Get out! .. Get out!

230
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:44,589
You hear me?
- I hear you!

231
00:18:45,509 --> 00:18:50,229
Please let me know,
if you have one in stock ...

232
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:03,429
And the sign: "Demosfen Kuzmanovic."
- Kuz-ma-no-vich.

233
00:19:14,949 --> 00:19:17,789
With the advent of Nikos
our usual home line ...

234
00:19:17,869 --> 00:19:20,069
... Turned upside down ...

235
00:19:21,109 --> 00:19:23,429
The first victim
Nice was the goat ...

236
00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:27,229
Equip ..., Porva suffer
new occupant.

237
00:19:30,349 --> 00:19:32,989
To live under one roof
was not so simple.

238
00:19:33,069 --> 00:19:39,829
The two neighbors fought tirelessly ...
Beak horn ... Beak horn for ...

239
00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:44,549
Overcoming that you're
greater creativity.

240
00:19:44,669 --> 00:19:47,589
Each fiercely defended
its territory ...

241
00:19:48,389 --> 00:19:53,549
At the end of kraishtatav, realizing
they have no choice, be reconciled.

242
00:19:54,349 --> 00:19:56,109
"FAVORITE ANTONIA"

243
00:19:56,229 --> 00:20:00,189
But, of course, the main battle
was between me and my father.

244
00:20:02,229 --> 00:20:05,109
Well then ...
Now we have to learn to fly ...

245
00:20:05,189 --> 00:20:09,309
Believe me, it's not complicated ...
That look will show you ...

246
00:20:10,189 --> 00:20:13,789
Open the wings - and fly ...
Go ahead, hop!

247
00:20:20,029 --> 00:20:22,429
Get wings and bounce!

248
00:20:26,269 --> 00:20:28,029
E! ..
Come on!

249
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:33,149
Now bounce, Nikos, bounce!

250
00:20:40,229 --> 00:20:42,229
You lazy, lazy!

251
00:20:51,629 --> 00:20:53,669
Hop! .. Hop! ..
Bravo!

252
00:20:54,709 --> 00:20:56,669
Watch not to swallow ...

253
00:20:56,749 --> 00:20:59,309
Hop! .. Hop! ..
Give the pass!

254
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,349
So run, run!

255
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:09,029
Now returns ...
Shoo! .. Get out and hide!

256
00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:21,789
So what kind of bird is this?
- This is the Pelican ... A friend of mine.

257
00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:24,389
And where do you have?
- Long story.

258
00:21:25,109 --> 00:21:29,389
Here is what constantly busy? ..
In a game bird fitbol?

259
00:21:29,469 --> 00:21:32,069
I do my job ...
And take care of it ...

260
00:21:32,149 --> 00:21:34,309
What's wrong with that?
- Where did you hide?

261
00:21:34,389 --> 00:21:35,829
In podnavesa ...
There sleeps.

262
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:38,989
Who gives it? ..
Just do not you dare lie to me.

263
00:21:39,189 --> 00:21:41,669
I bought it from the master of
"Son of Star."

264
00:21:41,949 --> 00:21:45,429
What? ..
More specifically Traded it for one thing.

265
00:21:46,229 --> 00:21:47,469
Exchanged?

266
00:21:49,629 --> 00:21:51,269
For Mama cross.

267
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:55,589
Change your cross its
mother for Pelican?

268
00:21:55,709 --> 00:21:59,029
And this? .. Where is it? ..
What is this? .. A? ..

269
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:01,109
How ...?

270
00:22:07,989 --> 00:22:10,429
Daddy, Daddy!
"Daddy, Daddy" ...

271
00:22:10,669 --> 00:22:12,549
Dad!
"Dad" ...

272
00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:15,389
Dad!

273
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:28,869
Dad, let him!

274
00:22:34,189 --> 00:22:35,869
Fly! ..
In Live!

275
00:22:39,789 --> 00:22:42,149
Dad ...

276
00:22:42,229 --> 00:22:46,829
"Dad" ... Pelican! ..

277
00:23:19,429 --> 00:23:20,989
Go medicine!

278
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:28,949
Just to see Pelican
and it is done!

279
00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:36,629
More ...

280
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:42,269
Cross me.
- Broke is f

281
00:23:59,789 --> 00:24:00,949

282
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:10,909
You're back! ..
How nice!

283
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:14,109
Nikos ...
My Nikos.

284
00:24:15,629 --> 00:24:19,389
No noise ...
Do not Wake the evil enemy.

285
00:24:21,629 --> 00:24:24,389
Do not be afraid ...
I will not divide us ...

286
00:24:25,949 --> 00:24:29,749
I'll take you to Myrtle ...
See how beautiful.

287
00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:09,669
Wait for me!

288
00:25:12,829 --> 00:25:14,149
Wait for me.

289
00:25:16,989 --> 00:25:19,229
Soon will fly, Nikos.

290
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:23,749
However his father did not speak.

291
00:25:23,909 --> 00:25:25,469
Hear me ...

292
00:25:26,029 --> 00:25:30,429
Nothing will help so happens ...
But actually that's great.

293
00:25:30,589 --> 00:25:31,509
Why?

294
00:25:31,589 --> 00:25:34,029
Grab the corners ... Go ...
Bravo.

295
00:25:34,109 --> 00:25:37,389
Now that the truth is revealed
things came to my place.

296
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:39,069
What I think is not so
holy Father.

297
00:25:39,149 --> 00:25:42,629
My father is angry at me,
I lied to him and to cross ...

298
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:46,229
I will not forgive me.
- Have patience, Janis ...

299
00:25:46,349 --> 00:25:48,709
Naturally you
You can easily say it.

300
00:25:49,989 --> 00:25:54,229
Everything will be fine ...
This is his message.

301
00:25:55,629 --> 00:25:58,949
Are you sure that you understand?
- Hey you!

302
00:26:31,429 --> 00:26:32,829

303
00:26:54,869 --> 00:26:56,909
Nikos learn to fly ...

304
00:26:59,149 --> 00:27:02,789
I envied him that sees
islands of high ...

305
00:27:02,909 --> 00:27:06,509
Nikos has become a big
beautiful bird.

306
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:19,789
We realize that there
could not go unnoticed.

307
00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:26,389
Vish pilotage, Nikos! ..
Landing least it should not.

308
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:31,189
Promise not to fly away, Nikos ...

309
00:27:33,309 --> 00:27:35,269
I do not wanna lose.

310
00:27:35,349 --> 00:27:36,349
It was a pelican, Dad?

311
00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:39,589
I first saw it!
- No, I was first.

312
00:27:39,669 --> 00:27:41,389
No, I do!
- No, I ...

Hello Demosfen ...

316

By Thursday I will bring you

Consider them as delivered.

00:27:58,949 --> 00:28:01,989
Pelican have seen huge ...
The whole village talking.

Stop, to whom I speak!

Torgoviyata today are you mine?

331
00:28:42,229 --> 00:28:45,869
Still ...
People do not buy just about anything.

332
00:28:45,949 --> 00:28:47,629
And I do not know why.

333
00:28:50,629 --> 00:28:52,029
And tomorrow ...

334
00:28:52,869 --> 00:28:56,589
For tomorrow, what are you plans?

Yeah right, tomorrow.

To turn on your music?

00:30:34,429 --> 00:30:36,429
Tourists in droves
arrive on the island ..

339
00:30:36,509 --> 00:30:38,749
To ... a glimpse of his
Pelican stupid.

340

00:30:53,509 --> 00:30:56,709
What business would do
only touch this bird.

348
00:30:56,789 --> 00:30:59,109
Vazilis,
Should I talk about this now?

349
00:30:59,189 --> 00:31:02,349
Today is Mata, what your pelican! ..
Get out there on the street and talk!

350
00:31:02,429 --> 00:31:04,429

At the end!

352
00:31:11,149 --> 00:31:12,549
Where is Uncle?

353
00:31:13,349 --> 00:31:15,709
Angelica! ..
Niece!

354
00:31:16,629 --> 00:31:18,789
Hello!
- Good evening!

355
00:31:18,869 --> 00:31:21,509
Good evening!
- Hello!

356
00:31:26,349 --> 00:31:29,389
Beauty, eh? ..
The daughter of my brother ...

357
00:31:30,069 --> 00:31:33,149
Arrives to work during vacation.

358
00:31:33,829 --> 00:31:36,949
Look how the "Spree" those Germans.

359
00:31:37,709 --> 00:31:40,389
Remember my words ...
Away you go ...

360
00:31:49,029 --> 00:31:51,749
Can you look aside?
- I did not understand?

361
00:31:52,589 --> 00:31:54,149
Do not treat.

362
00:31:55,429 --> 00:31:58,829
For me what you think?
- For an Orthodox priest.

363
00:31:58,949 --> 00:32:00,189
There, you see!

364
00:32:00,989 --> 00:32:03,229
The sun does not sit long ...

365
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:07,229
There is no coverage ...

366
00:32:22,629 --> 00:32:25,189
How much cheese?
- 2 euro 40 cents.

367
00:32:25,269 --> 00:32:26,389
Here he is!

368
00:32:26,469 --> 00:32:29,549
How quickly fly ...
And turbot is huge!

369
00:32:33,669 --> 00:32:35,989
No, no, Nikos, you should!

370
00:32:36,109 --> 00:32:38,949
This is not for you ... Fly! ..
Go home!

371
00:32:39,429 --> 00:32:42,069
I have to work!
- You could have asked for cheese?

372
00:32:42,149 --> 00:32:44,349
This albatross is it?
- No, Pelican.

373
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:46,149
Oh! ..
Did you see that!

374
00:32:46,309 --> 00:32:48,509
Look back up!

375
00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:53,469
Just fantastic!
- Oh, landed on the roof!

376
00:32:55,549 --> 00:32:57,629
Pelican Is yours? ..
Why are you silent until now?

377
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:59,349
I'm not his master ...
Friends are.

378
00:32:59,429 --> 00:33:02,309
Go! .. Fly!
- How wonderful ...

379
00:33:02,389 --> 00:33:04,669
Buy fresh fish!

380
00:33:11,429 --> 00:33:13,789
Why not listen? ..
Let's go.

381
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:16,549
Stand back, do his time!

382
00:33:21,469 --> 00:33:22,589
Come on ...

383
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:25,549
It is now flying ...
Fly ...

384
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:28,429
Fly to the cave ...

385
00:33:35,709 --> 00:33:37,229
Unbelievable!

386
00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:44,949
Bravo! .. Bravo! ..
Bravo!

387
00:33:45,029 --> 00:33:47,749
That's it! ..
What a beauty!

388
00:33:48,629 --> 00:33:51,669
Your son can make a roll collar.

389
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:54,629
This pelican was a gift from heaven.

390
00:33:56,429 --> 00:33:59,749
Get out, get out of here.
Get on!

391
00:34:01,389 --> 00:34:03,029
Hello, Yannis.

392
00:34:05,149 --> 00:34:07,989
Yannis! ..
Today I will buy you a drink ...

393
00:34:08,349 --> 00:34:10,829
Tell me more.
- No, thanks ...

394
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:13,709
I go,
that the consignment is unattended.

395
00:34:13,829 --> 00:34:15,429
Work TRULY MEET work.

396
00:34:15,869 --> 00:34:18,549
It does not happen often
Aristotle, one to draw.

397
00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:21,429
Do not give up! ..
I'm Angelica, his niece.

398
00:34:21,509 --> 00:34:23,109
And you are?
- Yannis.

399
00:34:26,749 --> 00:34:29,309
Angelica! ..
I have one hundred hands.

400
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:31,149
Just a minute, uncle.

401
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:34,829
Do not call me uncle at work,
this is not professional.

402
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:36,709
Okay.
I gotta go.

403
00:34:36,829 --> 00:34:39,789
Today I saw
of "private transport".

404
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:42,669
We will ride with you if you ask me.

405
00:36:44,709 --> 00:36:46,149
Go ...

406
00:36:47,709 --> 00:36:49,069
Fly!

407
00:37:27,509 --> 00:37:29,229
The heads are gone ...

408
00:37:33,429 --> 00:37:36,629
Tomorrow I will go to the village of his stand two.

409
00:37:41,269 --> 00:37:43,509
How do you say?
- Nikostratos.

410
00:37:43,629 --> 00:37:45,469
A large is it?
- Very high.

411
00:37:45,549 --> 00:37:47,909
How tall are you?
- 1.56.

412
00:37:48,029 --> 00:37:49,749
And I love steaks?

413
00:37:50,069 --> 00:37:53,269
And where steaks at sea? ..
Pelican is a marine animal.

414
00:37:53,349 --> 00:37:55,189
Hello!
Pilgrims annoy you?

415
00:37:55,269 --> 00:37:58,549
This is it, the burden of fame ...
Help me to get off.

416
00:37:58,669 --> 00:38:00,789
Chichomi about you
day and night.

417
00:38:00,909 --> 00:38:03,429
Yesterday, for example,
so work-

418
00:38:03,509 --> 00:38:05,589
as never was making.

419
00:38:05,709 --> 00:38:08,869
When the accounts relates only wept.

420
00:38:08,949 --> 00:38:10,589
Pelicans your home you?

421
00:38:10,709 --> 00:38:12,989
My father was against it.

422
00:38:13,069 --> 00:38:15,029
How so?
- I have been on the island.

423
00:38:15,109 --> 00:38:17,069
Who?
- For what I'm talking about.

424
00:38:17,149 --> 00:38:18,109
And rightly so.

425
00:38:18,189 --> 00:38:20,909
Customers continually ask for this.

426
00:38:20,989 --> 00:38:22,709
Terribly afraid of bees.

427
00:38:36,949 --> 00:38:37,909
Angelica!

428
00:38:37,989 --> 00:38:40,229
What do you interfere now
come on time?

429
00:38:40,309 --> 00:38:43,549
And do everything
I pay and without too much?

430
00:38:43,669 --> 00:38:46,669
Too much!?
Is my salary ovilichil!?

431
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:49,829
Janis, wait! ..
I'll buy from you cheese.

432
00:38:50,669 --> 00:38:53,989
Hang on, my uncle wants
to talk to you about the pelican.

433
00:38:54,069 --> 00:38:55,829
Now we see Janis.

434
00:38:58,109 --> 00:39:01,469
Juice at the expense of the establishment
young friend, accommodated.

435
00:39:01,869 --> 00:39:04,869
You can cry, and the pelican,
not vazrazavam ...

436
00:39:04,949 --> 00:39:07,749
Angelica,
Bring juice to a local celebrity.

437
00:39:07,829 --> 00:39:10,509
Do not forget to put and straw.
- D yeah!

438
00:39:10,629 --> 00:39:12,269
After a minute, boss.

439
00:39:13,189 --> 00:39:16,189
Your pelican
has hit number one.

440
00:39:16,469 --> 00:39:19,989
All seemed to go crazy.
- Angelica said.

441
00:39:20,069 --> 00:39:22,909
Brought you a big profit.

442
00:39:22,989 --> 00:39:26,069
For this gain will be silent.

443
00:39:26,149 --> 00:39:28,869
Do not worry, Aristototel,
I understand everything.

444
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:33,309
In this case, come in five
with his Nikostratos.

445
00:39:33,749 --> 00:39:37,589
By noon it is too hot ..
Afternoon is dead time.

446
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:40,749
Many customers want
to be photographed with the pelican.

447
00:39:40,829 --> 00:39:45,629
You can sleep on the terrace.
Magical time at sunset.

448
00:39:46,109 --> 00:39:49,269
We earned decent money.
Nothing is going to take for themselves.

449
00:39:49,349 --> 00:39:52,989
An orange juice through a straw.
Oops!

450
00:39:54,109 --> 00:39:56,309
It is now without a straw.

451
00:39:56,389 --> 00:40:00,629
And what funny imav this?
- Relax it's only a joke.

452
00:40:00,709 --> 00:40:04,229
I did not understand her joke
You think you ... A?

453
00:40:08,909 --> 00:40:10,869
This is the guy with the bird.

454
00:40:11,069 --> 00:40:13,949
Are you the guy with the penguin?
- Please?

455
00:40:14,029 --> 00:40:18,589
With Penguin, actually a pelican.
I want to shoot him.

456
00:40:18,669 --> 00:40:21,229
He says he wants the bird to shoot.

457
00:40:21,309 --> 00:40:23,429
And in return for what?
- In cash?

458
00:40:23,829 --> 00:40:26,949
White money for a simple picture.
I agree!

459
00:40:27,029 --> 00:40:29,469
I do not need anything.
Thank you anyway.

460
00:40:29,589 --> 00:40:32,429
Not receive inheritance
or all of your home?

461
00:40:32,549 --> 00:40:36,669
You are with his uncle.
Departments are not the most important.

462
00:40:37,589 --> 00:40:39,909
My friend asks, "how?"

463
00:40:39,989 --> 00:40:44,789
Pay 10 euros for photography.

464
00:40:48,229 --> 00:40:49,949
What did you say?

465
00:40:50,229 --> 00:40:53,509
He said the pelican you beaut.

466
00:40:53,789 --> 00:40:56,029
Tell her that I know.

467
00:40:56,109 --> 00:40:58,309
He says that "it is little."

468
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:00,949
Business man.
- Right.

469
00:41:01,349 --> 00:41:04,709
I give 15
my last word.

470
00:41:08,589 --> 00:41:12,149
Her younger sister is very ill
and can not come here ..

471
00:41:12,229 --> 00:41:14,189
Pelican ... and her favorite bird.

472
00:41:14,269 --> 00:41:17,429
Many will be glad if
gift to get a photograph.

473
00:41:17,549 --> 00:41:20,189
Have you no mercy?
- Ok, it happens.

474
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:24,229
But only once.
- Agreed, but 20.

475
00:41:25,269 --> 00:41:30,629
Bida not look like Bill Gates?
We agreed.

476
00:41:30,949 --> 00:41:32,949
See Nikostratos!

477
00:41:39,589 --> 00:41:42,869
More than you earn
of cheese, right?

478
00:42:14,629 --> 00:42:16,109
Hello Kitsa!

479
00:42:34,069 --> 00:42:37,269
Tomorrow off to Tyre.
For vintage.

480
00:42:38,109 --> 00:42:41,389
For long?
- There will understand.

481
00:42:42,629 --> 00:42:48,189
We need money, and you alone.
Time flies and do not feel it.

482
00:42:59,069 --> 00:43:01,149
Kitsa!
This is rubbish.

483
00:43:09,029 --> 00:43:11,509
My father is going to go to far.

484
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:15,949
Of gasoline you do not need.
You have to help.

485
00:43:19,589 --> 00:43:22,669
And "Dawn" was
"Pelikanski island."

486
00:43:25,989 --> 00:43:28,789
Tourists arriving in waves.

487
00:43:28,869 --> 00:43:31,069
infinitely glad that Aristotle

488
00:43:31,149 --> 00:43:34,509
owner
the only cafe on the island.

489
00:43:34,629 --> 00:43:36,189
What air.
What a sight.

490
00:43:36,269 --> 00:43:40,029
And as the only benchmark
was making big profits.

491
00:43:40,109 --> 00:43:42,669
What do you want?
- Two photos of pelicans.

492
00:43:42,749 --> 00:43:44,589
Group?
- Not alone.

493
00:43:44,669 --> 00:43:48,109
Idividualnite photos are more expensive.
Keep this in mind.

494
00:43:52,189 --> 00:43:55,829
What would you order?
- Ook, please.

495
00:44:04,469 --> 00:44:07,229
On that Nikos had no incumbent.

496
00:44:07,349 --> 00:44:10,269
That's why our business does not go bad.

497
00:44:17,069 --> 00:44:20,189
But everyone kept a secret.

498
00:44:20,549 --> 00:44:22,429
What do you want?
Now I come!

499
00:44:22,549 --> 00:44:25,509
Jump her legs become too small.
Good!

500
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:29,029
Guess I'll hire another waiter.

501
00:44:29,109 --> 00:44:32,549
Do not lose your mind!
Steam on my arm falls?

502
00:44:32,909 --> 00:44:34,789
Angelica - a family member.

503
00:44:34,869 --> 00:44:38,069
All enter into a pocket
but you that you clearly.

504
00:44:43,509 --> 00:44:46,469
If you want to help do not worry!

505
00:44:49,429 --> 00:44:50,669
A young rabbit.

506
00:44:51,029 --> 00:44:54,109
Does not understand the subtleties of the craft.

507
00:44:58,189 --> 00:44:59,389
Here's your share.

508
00:44:59,509 --> 00:45:03,109
For what do you think?
- For a brilliant manager ...

509
00:45:03,189 --> 00:45:05,149
What not to give up white money?

510
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:08,869
Not receive inheritance
or all of your home?

511
00:45:08,949 --> 00:45:10,109
Boss!

512
00:45:10,229 --> 00:45:13,109
I want tomorrow, Yannis
to lead him in stores.

513
00:45:13,869 --> 00:45:15,189
Where?

514
00:45:15,389 --> 00:45:17,829
In high season? ..
Do you want me bankrupt?

515
00:45:17,909 --> 00:45:22,309
Wonderful to deal without me.
Glamorous and have a great experience.

516
00:45:22,429 --> 00:45:27,189
Any conversation can lead.
And I do not have to pay dase.

517
00:45:30,829 --> 00:45:33,389
Until recently, Aristotle!

518
00:45:40,949 --> 00:45:42,149
Look!

519
00:45:42,269 --> 00:45:44,509
This Court
I sold Nikostratos.

520
00:45:44,589 --> 00:45:47,349
A police captain arrested him.
- Police? .. Why?

521
00:45:47,469 --> 00:45:50,669
Poured fuel on the coast.
This suits many.

522
00:45:50,749 --> 00:45:52,869
And how much you paid for it, this bird?

523
00:45:52,949 --> 00:45:55,589
Mama gave him a golden cross.

524
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:58,269
She gave it?
- Her is gone three years.

525
00:45:58,389 --> 00:46:01,589
Your mother has died?
And you and replaced the cross?

526
00:46:02,709 --> 00:46:03,949
Let's go.

527
00:46:04,469 --> 00:46:07,869
Forgive me
always speak first, then think.

528
00:46:07,989 --> 00:46:10,549
Everything is fine.
You're my only friend.

529
00:46:10,629 --> 00:46:11,789
No offense.

530
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:14,069
And your father how he reacted
uznavuznavayki,

531
00:46:14,149 --> 00:46:16,589
that he replaced the cross on the bird?

532
00:46:16,669 --> 00:46:19,509
Poor, but
not a gift from my father.

533
00:46:20,389 --> 00:46:23,749
Hold on Athens! ..
People!

534
00:46:24,909 --> 00:46:27,429
Hello everyone!
Hello everyone!

535
00:46:29,509 --> 00:46:30,989
Watch in mine!

536
00:46:33,869 --> 00:46:35,189
Go ...

537
00:46:36,669 --> 00:46:39,589
Are you afraid?
Add a little!

538
00:46:40,309 --> 00:46:41,669
Omotri traffic jam!

539
00:46:41,749 --> 00:46:43,749
Look!
Do you see?

540
00:46:44,429 --> 00:46:46,029
We go now!

541
00:46:55,069 --> 00:46:57,309
I'll meet Cousin.

542
00:46:57,389 --> 00:47:00,229
What people ..
I see today with his company.

543
00:47:00,349 --> 00:47:01,349
This is Janis!

544
00:47:01,669 --> 00:47:03,109
To dance?
- Yes ...

545
00:47:05,669 --> 00:47:08,749
To go?
- No! .. You do not like to grind.

546
00:47:09,429 --> 00:47:10,869
And I love it!

547
00:48:42,509 --> 00:48:44,549
Yannis!
Look.

548
00:48:46,789 --> 00:48:48,909
But that snore!

549
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:52,469
Cross me!
From where?

550
00:48:52,549 --> 00:48:57,549
Go and look - something shiny in the dust.
I look closely - your cross!

551
00:48:57,789 --> 00:49:02,309
Just kidding, silly, I bought it
while the master slept.

552
00:49:02,389 --> 00:49:06,229
What, one night
in its port you gone?

553
00:49:06,309 --> 00:49:09,349
With me was a cousin.
For me it will do.

554
00:49:10,309 --> 00:49:12,389
He's my bodyguard.

555
00:49:17,709 --> 00:49:20,269
This will not forget it.

556
00:49:23,269 --> 00:49:25,149
I guess a lot of money you gave.

557
00:49:25,229 --> 00:49:28,149
What?!
Marketplaces as a gypsy for him.

558
00:49:28,389 --> 00:49:31,989
Now you owe me.
I want to Myrtle.

559
00:49:33,669 --> 00:49:36,229
Do not give up easily, eh?

560
00:49:38,749 --> 00:49:40,269
Aha!

561
00:49:43,149 --> 00:49:45,309
Where is our Nikostratos?

562
00:49:46,709 --> 00:49:48,429
Hiding somewhere.

563
00:49:54,789 --> 00:49:57,909
I'm starving.
Is there anything zayadene?

564
00:49:58,109 --> 00:50:00,909
Okorsh will.
Just nalovya.

565
00:50:01,229 --> 00:50:03,469
I eat fish for breakfast?

566
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:16,669
Hey, you!

567
00:50:19,069 --> 00:50:20,709
High f

568
00:50:20,989 --> 00:50:23,829
Jump! Do not be afraid!

569
00:50:25,829 --> 00:50:27,309
Do not hurt?

570
00:50:29,229 --> 00:50:31,029
I'll try here.

571
00:50:52,469 --> 00:50:54,429
Not jealous, Nikos!

572
00:51:21,789 --> 00:51:24,029
Fool you, Janis! ..
You scared me.

573
00:51:24,429 --> 00:51:27,109
I'll bake
and will lick your fingers.

574
00:51:27,669 --> 00:51:30,469
Who dives more deeply ...

575
00:51:30,789 --> 00:51:33,029
... Gets bigger!

576
00:51:39,349 --> 00:51:41,189
I won!
- No, I do!

577
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:43,429
Hey!
What are you doing?

578
00:51:43,869 --> 00:51:47,509
Nikos!
- That is what is the real winner.

579
00:51:50,749 --> 00:51:53,829
P earlier fish together
and spent much time.

580
00:51:53,949 --> 00:51:55,789
After the death of my mother
everything changed.

581
00:51:55,869 --> 00:51:57,389
Curse?
- Permanently.

582
00:51:57,469 --> 00:51:59,029
And the beat?
- No, do not beat me.

583
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:01,309
But I stuck permanently
and not for something.

584
00:52:01,389 --> 00:52:04,269
Pick? ..
And that's all you can say?

585
00:52:04,349 --> 00:52:05,749
Do you believe that enough?

586
00:52:05,829 --> 00:52:10,109
Now ke teach an oath
it will help you ...

587
00:52:10,389 --> 00:52:14,069
Repetition! .. From the fools do not fear! ..
Do not be afraid!

588
00:52:14,429 --> 00:52:15,909
From the fools do not fear!

589
00:52:16,229 --> 00:52:17,829
Fools! ..
From the fools do not fear!

590
00:52:17,949 --> 00:52:20,269
From the fools do not fear! ..
Do not be afraid!

591
00:52:20,349 --> 00:52:22,789
From the fools do not fear! ..
Do not be afraid!

592
00:52:26,149 --> 00:52:29,069
What do you frowned?
- What?

593
00:52:29,709 --> 00:52:33,869
I asked them: What do you frowned?
- I frowned.

594
00:52:34,349 --> 00:52:37,269
Today is the finest
day of my life.

595
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:41,269
Glad to meet you.

596
00:52:43,069 --> 00:52:45,829
With you is not easy
but it is fun.

597
00:52:54,909 --> 00:52:56,589
You will not get anything
Nothing will give you.

598
00:52:59,549 --> 00:53:02,629
Get out, Nikos! ..
Do not be afraid.

599
00:53:03,509 --> 00:53:06,709
What do you do?
- Struck me.

600
00:53:06,829 --> 00:53:10,069
What is happening here?
- It's okay.

601
00:53:10,149 --> 00:53:13,029
The location of wildlife is
zoo. Do not cry my dear little boy!

602
00:53:13,109 --> 00:53:15,869
For him, this is a game.
Flying to the cave!

603
00:53:20,709 --> 00:53:22,269
Dad is furious.

604
00:53:22,349 --> 00:53:25,109
Yes, but not touched him,
only ice cream and bitten.

605
00:53:25,189 --> 00:53:26,229
Big deal, a great drama.

606
00:53:26,309 --> 00:53:29,589
And if it veshe bitten in the eye?
Maybe we would still be funny?

607
00:53:29,669 --> 00:53:31,309
A pelican has Dio animal.

608
00:53:31,389 --> 00:53:33,869
I turned it into a circus performer
and here is the result.

609
00:53:33,989 --> 00:53:35,509
Olives paw
and other such nonsense.

610
00:53:35,589 --> 00:53:38,509
All food brought him
and never think about fish.

611
00:53:38,589 --> 00:53:41,389
Not exaggerated ...
Just like it is among the company.

612
00:53:41,469 --> 00:53:44,629
This is better than alone in the cave.
- It is,

613
00:53:44,869 --> 00:53:46,509
Listen, listen!

614
00:53:48,189 --> 00:53:51,469
I will buy him sunglasses
and let them hang out on the beach.

615
00:53:51,549 --> 00:53:53,589
So no one know it nyamada
- Funny you?

616
00:53:53,669 --> 00:53:57,189
You're with her uncle - only
their respective interests you think.

617
00:53:57,389 --> 00:53:59,349
And you - when your father!

618
00:54:24,069 --> 00:54:26,829
Manoli! ..
Manoli, where he fled?

619
00:54:26,909 --> 00:54:29,589
Now we hide.
You are looking for!

620
00:54:29,949 --> 00:54:31,789
You can not hide.

621
00:54:31,909 --> 00:54:34,349
Manoli, you are looking for!
- I do not want!

622
00:54:35,989 --> 00:54:37,309
Manoli!

623
00:54:58,429 --> 00:54:59,549
Come on.

624
00:55:10,189 --> 00:55:11,629
Who is this?

625
00:55:24,709 --> 00:55:26,469
When your father returns?

626
00:55:26,549 --> 00:55:29,549
Does anyone know.
When the grape harvest.

627
00:55:29,629 --> 00:55:32,149
Carefully, Father Kosmas! ..
Let me help you.

628
00:55:32,349 --> 00:55:34,909
That's it.
Leave no longer needed.

629
00:55:36,349 --> 00:55:39,589
How do you feel without him?
- Neither good nor bad.

630
00:55:40,069 --> 00:55:41,469
But I was sad.

631
00:55:43,029 --> 00:55:46,149
Do not be surprised:
of how two Sundays left.

632
00:55:46,389 --> 00:55:48,869
Sadly, even when I was here.

633
00:56:00,109 --> 00:56:03,069
Cafe
"NIKOSTRATOS"

634
00:56:03,149 --> 00:56:04,789
It looks bad?

635
00:56:06,869 --> 00:56:09,429
Praise goes to your son.

636
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:13,069
As for his bird.
Come get in.

637
00:56:13,349 --> 00:56:16,269
In your absence
here has changed a lot.

638
00:56:16,669 --> 00:56:18,869
I see.

639
00:56:19,229 --> 00:56:22,189
This pelican is a blessing for the island.

640
00:56:22,349 --> 00:56:24,549
We never had such tourists.

641
00:56:24,669 --> 00:56:27,349
Ferry which leads to Mycenae
comes to us on the island.

642
00:56:27,429 --> 00:56:30,589
Business protsavtyava
- Circle of your interests has not changed.

643
00:56:30,709 --> 00:56:34,669
And your character too.
- Hordes of idiots you are a heart?

644
00:56:34,789 --> 00:56:38,669
These tapatsisa our customers! ..
And deserve due respect ...

645
00:56:39,269 --> 00:56:41,989
If you do not like -
go home.

646
00:56:42,069 --> 00:56:45,389
I'm home! Thomas is my village.
You did your wedding!

647
00:56:45,469 --> 00:56:48,389
Hear my advice:
marry again.

648
00:56:49,469 --> 00:56:52,309
And your visitors will not command me!

649
00:56:55,709 --> 00:56:57,069
Iztreshtyalka.

650
00:57:03,309 --> 00:57:05,349
What happened?
Who is this?

651
00:57:05,429 --> 00:57:08,029
The father of Janis.
Slightly scrimmage.

652
00:57:08,749 --> 00:57:10,709
He stood by my side uncomfortable.

653
00:57:20,669 --> 00:57:21,989
Dad.

654
00:57:23,709 --> 00:57:25,069
Dad!

655
00:57:28,029 --> 00:57:30,869
Dad!
Have you been back?

656
00:57:34,829 --> 00:57:39,429
Just.
I go and no one at home.

657
00:57:40,509 --> 00:57:41,869
Where have you been?

658
00:57:43,709 --> 00:57:46,309
And where are those new clothes
Room?

659
00:57:46,389 --> 00:57:48,269
And the shoes?
Who is this?

660
00:57:48,709 --> 00:57:50,429
Mine.
- And what is bought?

661
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:52,389
With my earned money.

662
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:53,429
And from where?

663
00:57:53,509 --> 00:57:56,309
Tourists pay.
When taking pictures with Nikos.

664
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:58,949
With my pelican!
- And you think this is working?

665
00:57:59,029 --> 00:58:03,989
Better than your fishing!
I even have my mum's Cross.

666
00:58:09,189 --> 00:58:10,669
Yanni!

667
00:58:21,949 --> 00:58:23,309
Yanni!

668
00:58:50,869 --> 00:58:54,269
Nikos, let me sleep.
Nikos, do not be afraid.

669
00:58:54,469 --> 00:58:56,029
This is safe.

670
00:58:57,909 --> 00:58:59,629
Nikos, relax.

671
00:59:15,589 --> 00:59:16,749
Nikos!

672
00:59:19,429 --> 00:59:20,869
Nikos!

673
00:59:28,109 --> 00:59:29,309
Nikos!

674
01:00:02,229 --> 01:00:03,629
Angelica!

675
01:00:04,029 --> 01:00:08,869
Did you at any time predicting the sea?
- Ha-ha, belly ached from laughter.

676
01:00:12,069 --> 01:00:15,909
Not now ..
Next. Let's get out.

677
01:00:18,149 --> 01:00:20,629
Then you will play.
I have no mood.

678
01:00:22,629 --> 01:00:25,189
No, no, no!
This is no time to play.

679
01:00:25,269 --> 01:00:28,229
Marsh, Nikos ... talk to you!
Get out of here.

680
01:00:28,389 --> 01:00:29,829
Go on the street!

681
01:00:30,029 --> 01:00:32,149
Nikos!

682
01:00:35,989 --> 01:00:38,109
Here is my bill so.

683
01:00:47,469 --> 01:00:51,429
Dance with the pelican,

01:00:51,829 --> 01:00:53,109
For fun!

685
01:00:53,189 --> 01:00:55,869
Dance with the pelican,

686
01:00:55,989 --> 01:00:58,669
Approaching the village with the pelican.

687
01:00:58,749 --> 01:01:01,309
Pelican called Nikostratos!

688
01:01:01,389 --> 01:01:04,629
Mrs. Flora, our otdovno tions us

689
01:01:04,709 --> 01:01:08,389
I had to buy from others.
- My old man is already pretty lazy.

690
01:01:08,509 --> 01:01:11,069
A Nikostratos! ..
Come here.

691
01:01:11,309 --> 01:01:13,949
Well, go, I have a job.

Come here!
Brzo faster!

Dancing ...

01:01:27,989 --> 01:01:29,069
No!

696
01:01:29,349 --> 01:01:30,909
Not my fault!

697
01:01:34,869 --> 01:01:37,549
Aristotle!
Aristotle!

698
01:01:38,149 --> 01:01:39,629
Aristotle!

699
01:01:40,509 --> 01:01:42,309
Nikostratos ...

700
01:02:19,989 --> 01:02:23,189
Why are you wearing dark glasses and their
you see nothing!

701
01:02:23,269 --> 01:02:24,349
I have nothing in common.

702
01:02:24,469 --> 01:02:28,189
Why do you see in the hall of abtobusa?
- Who has driven them to talk!

703
01:02:28,269 --> 01:02:30,309
Come on, Christina,
bad enough for me.

704
01:02:30,429 --> 01:02:31,509
Both are guilty.

705
01:02:31,789 --> 01:02:34,549
Spread out in the country.
Let mine.

706
01:02:34,669 --> 01:02:36,549
Shut all.
Shut up!

707
01:03:32,029 --> 01:03:33,669
Help!

708
01:04:14,069 --> 01:04:17,029
What happened?
- The bus hit him!

709
01:04:17,109 --> 01:04:19,629
Squeeze his beak.
- Come on.

710
01:04:23,069 --> 01:04:24,709
Free table.

711
01:04:32,549 --> 01:04:35,669
Scissors, Scissors!
More vivid, more vivid!

712
01:04:51,509 --> 01:04:53,069
Poor.

713
01:04:53,429 --> 01:04:55,629
Save him, save him.

714
01:04:56,789 --> 01:04:58,109
I will die.

715
01:05:01,149 --> 01:05:03,029
Help my dad.

716
01:05:05,789 --> 01:05:09,029
Now it is better to leave him in peace.

717
01:05:09,509 --> 01:05:13,709
Because of me ...
do not let him die!

718
01:05:19,629 --> 01:05:20,709
Dad ...

719
01:05:20,789 --> 01:05:24,109
As I felt nothing.

720
01:05:44,429 --> 01:05:45,709
Dad!

721
01:06:27,589 --> 01:06:28,869
Mom ...

722
01:06:31,709 --> 01:06:32,949
Mom!

723
01:08:01,709 --> 01:08:06,509
The whole village suffered in this tragedy
and worried about my condition.

724
01:08:06,589 --> 01:08:11,669
Angelica visited me every day
brings new and the others.

725
01:08:11,789 --> 01:08:13,989
But the island was obvzet of sorrow.

726
01:08:15,429 --> 01:08:19,189
A Myrtle, Where I was so happy
now deserted.

727
01:08:28,109 --> 01:08:31,189
Aristotle!
Demosfen coming!

728
01:08:37,109 --> 01:08:37,989
Here's the devil!

729
01:08:38,109 --> 01:08:41,589
Something I really sour.
- And another way you look?

730
01:08:48,909 --> 01:08:52,429
We're all worried about Janis.

731
01:08:52,509 --> 01:08:54,549
Yes ...
Is there such a rush ...

732
01:08:54,949 --> 01:08:57,669
Thanks ...
Plemyannitsata you here?

733
01:08:58,189 --> 01:08:59,469
Angelica!

734
01:08:59,709 --> 01:09:01,829
I am here.
What can not you see?

735
01:09:01,909 --> 01:09:05,309
Will you stay with Janis today?
- Uncle? .. Can I?

736
01:09:05,389 --> 01:09:06,829
What a question!

737
01:09:13,349 --> 01:09:16,749
Forgive for impact.
- I have asked him to cm.

738
01:09:21,709 --> 01:09:24,989
He stood by my side ... not convenient
I was not prepared ...

739
01:09:25,509 --> 01:09:27,829
All along, relax.

740
01:09:34,549 --> 01:09:38,269
Angelica sat with me,
To my father was at sea ...

741
01:09:38,469 --> 01:09:40,389
But I would have been like ...

742
01:09:40,829 --> 01:09:45,469
Even I wanted nothing to eat,
except lukuma Mrs. Flora.

743
01:10:32,429 --> 01:10:34,229
Family recipe?

744
01:10:34,669 --> 01:10:38,469
I prepared a potion with your father ...
It is a mixture of herbs ...

745
01:10:45,189 --> 01:10:47,709
Do not worry ...
Now is better.

746
01:11:07,429 --> 01:11:09,509
Angelica drink!

747
01:11:29,029 --> 01:11:31,589
I feel guilt for what happened.

748
01:11:31,669 --> 01:11:32,669
Why now you do.

749
01:11:32,749 --> 01:11:35,349
You did not hit him,
but its sought first aid.

750
01:11:35,429 --> 01:11:38,149
But surely I am convinced they can do
its star.

751
01:11:38,229 --> 01:11:42,269
If I had listened,
nothing wrong with it dase did not happen.

752
01:11:42,349 --> 01:11:44,189
Life was so bright ...

753
01:11:44,269 --> 01:11:48,589
If it was not taken by the ship
might not learn to fly.

754
01:11:48,669 --> 01:11:50,629
Fate, that's it.

755
01:11:51,509 --> 01:11:53,349
You not everything you know.

756
01:11:54,109 --> 01:11:59,549
Before this happened I cried,
and he flew at me ...

757
01:12:07,389 --> 01:12:10,229
The appearance, then the lack
Nikostratos of our lives ...

758
01:12:10,309 --> 01:12:12,349
Many changes ... islanders ...

759
01:12:12,429 --> 01:12:15,149
Aristotle at all at heart ...

760
01:12:15,229 --> 01:12:16,829
Nikos many lacked.

761
01:12:16,949 --> 01:12:19,829
And not because of profit
just loved it!

762
01:12:19,949 --> 01:12:22,469
Our Aristotle
had a sensitive soul.

763
01:12:22,549 --> 01:12:25,989
Vazilis did could not forgive
that abducted attention chauffeur, ..

764
01:12:26,069 --> 01:12:28,669
Become cost culprit ...
the death of Nikos ...

765
01:12:28,749 --> 01:12:32,309
Often lost in thought
circling the square.

766
01:12:32,949 --> 01:12:38,549
I also changed ...
I got up, how to tell an adult ...

767
01:12:40,869 --> 01:12:43,469
Yes, I think ...
Older.

768
01:12:45,869 --> 01:12:48,749
Life of the village still
usual move ...

769
01:12:50,189 --> 01:12:52,629
Madame Karusos
and her pious man ...

770
01:12:52,709 --> 01:12:56,669
Were prepared ...
to complete their family.

771
01:13:01,829 --> 01:13:06,389
My father, yet he spent his time
at sea or in the cafeteria of Aristotle ...

772
01:13:06,469 --> 01:13:10,749
Every sailor knows how to quell
grief at the death of a friend at sea.

773
01:13:12,429 --> 01:13:16,229
Soon travel agencies
leaflets dropped the island from ...

774
01:13:16,389 --> 01:13:21,189
We no longer docked ferries ...
Life returned to his bed.

775
01:13:21,309 --> 01:13:22,549
Everything is back in his old.

776
01:13:22,629 --> 01:13:24,669
Quick, quick! ..
All places!

777
01:13:24,749 --> 01:13:26,789
This is not so bad.

778
01:13:35,189 --> 01:13:38,109
Cafe 'NIKOSTRATOS "

779
01:13:44,109 --> 01:13:45,749
Violation of the prohibition of his father?

780
01:13:45,869 --> 01:13:49,509
We need to stay home
until a restore.

781
01:13:49,589 --> 01:13:51,989
I do hear it,
But now I am better.

782
01:13:52,109 --> 01:13:55,069
So it seems what you want?
- Coffee frappe.

783
01:13:55,189 --> 01:13:57,549
Odno coffee frappe
will now arrive!

784
01:13:58,749 --> 01:14:01,549
Yannis!
What a surprise only!

785
01:14:01,789 --> 01:14:03,669
Weak, there's no appetite you?

786
01:14:03,789 --> 01:14:06,349
Do not worry;
eating until full.

787
01:14:06,629 --> 01:14:09,829
We have not seen with your father.
- How so?

788
01:14:09,949 --> 01:14:12,349
He every night with you your drink.

789
01:14:12,429 --> 01:14:15,589
If I do not where you ...
you somewhere else to drink ...

790
01:14:15,829 --> 01:14:19,029
That where? ..
The island has only one cafe.

791
01:14:19,549 --> 01:14:22,909
Not so stupid father.
Is your girlfriend.

792
01:14:22,989 --> 01:14:25,749
A friend?
Off does not know him.

793
01:14:25,869 --> 01:14:30,029
But if one does not ohazhva,
then go where?

794
01:14:33,549 --> 01:14:35,629
You'll have to figure it out.

795
01:14:37,229 --> 01:14:39,789
And your coffee?
- Otstapvam you do!

796
01:14:43,349 --> 01:14:46,509
Do not tell me that it happened at sea.
- The sea?

797
01:14:46,589 --> 01:14:49,949
He took with him Nikostratos.
Do you suffer?

798
01:14:50,389 --> 01:14:52,429
He died almost immediately.

799
01:14:53,069 --> 01:14:56,269
Why it took the boat?
- To not watch.

800
01:14:56,349 --> 01:15:01,269
And where the body away?
- Threw it into the sea ...

801
01:15:01,709 --> 01:15:05,029
But do not trovozhi ...
it will catch fish.

802
01:15:05,109 --> 01:15:07,109
And I pluuu-vaaaa!

803
01:15:07,789 --> 01:15:11,709
I knew that I will never forget
time spent with Nikostratos.

804
01:15:11,829 --> 01:15:13,909
My father told again
what happened.

805
01:15:13,989 --> 01:15:15,669
But I could not lie ..

806
01:15:15,789 --> 01:15:18,189
And its history ...
seemed inconclusive.

807
01:15:18,269 --> 01:15:20,349
And interrogation is not subsidized.

808
01:15:20,429 --> 01:15:24,829
Sometimes, to understand the truth
should posrachkat little things.

809
01:15:24,949 --> 01:15:28,309
If my father would not go in cafe
then what do you do?

810
01:15:28,389 --> 01:15:30,349
Persistently sought answers.

811
01:15:48,709 --> 01:15:50,229
And, it's you!
- And what happened?

812
01:15:50,309 --> 01:15:52,589
I will clarify what my father does ...

813
01:15:52,909 --> 01:15:56,029
Just in time coming ...
We stand on guard.

814
01:15:58,229 --> 01:16:01,069
"If you do not have anything in mind!"
- I beg you!

815
01:16:01,349 --> 01:16:03,269
Okay ...
Away you go?

816
01:16:03,429 --> 01:16:06,029
We search the boat ...
If you see my father - played ...

817
01:16:06,109 --> 01:16:08,309
Know how, right?
- As for the question.

818
01:17:41,549 --> 01:17:42,949
Damn it!

819
01:17:44,749 --> 01:17:46,069
Yannis!

820
01:17:55,069 --> 01:17:56,909
Good day!
- Good to f ..

821
01:17:57,629 --> 01:18:00,109
Where is Janis?
- In the monastery ...

822
01:18:00,189 --> 01:18:01,349
I come to you.

823
01:18:01,429 --> 01:18:04,629
To ask:
hard you fish?

824
01:18:04,749 --> 01:18:08,949
Interested in fishing?
- Can you go into the kitchen?

825
01:18:09,029 --> 01:18:11,909
My eyes capital.

826
01:18:11,989 --> 01:18:14,109
Now seriously -
It eletniyat my project.

827
01:18:14,189 --> 01:18:16,909
For professions ...
All anglers must have a strong?

828
01:18:16,989 --> 01:18:19,589
I guess it is difficult to
draw heavy nets from the water?

829
01:18:19,709 --> 01:18:21,029
I have a winch.

830
01:18:21,109 --> 01:18:24,829
No one can winch
remove from the water network.

831
01:18:24,989 --> 01:18:25,989
Yeah, I know, I know.

832
01:18:26,069 --> 01:18:28,149
It's that shturavina
the bow of the boat!

833
01:18:29,029 --> 01:18:31,309
And it succeed
To keep your balance?

834
01:18:31,389 --> 01:18:32,669
You need skill.

835
01:18:32,789 --> 01:18:35,629
I can not imagine how
you are given to manage a boat ..

836
01:18:35,749 --> 01:18:37,549
Where ... is full to the brim with fish?

837
01:18:37,669 --> 01:18:40,429
Here for example, if I
wearing a heavy backpack ...

838
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:43,389
Always ... I feel
something that weighs me.

839
01:18:43,549 --> 01:18:45,349
In the way,
Janis helps you?

840
01:18:45,469 --> 01:18:49,389
Lately
just run the monastery day and night.

841
01:18:49,469 --> 01:18:50,669
As a mania.

842
01:18:50,789 --> 01:18:54,269
So heavy nets filled with fish
you pull with the help of a winch.

843
01:18:54,349 --> 01:18:57,629
then is not difficult
as a bicycle with three wheels.

844
01:18:57,749 --> 01:19:01,229
All the problems come from there
people want to get everything for free.

845
01:19:01,309 --> 01:19:04,909
This has become a phobia.
Take your work.

846
01:19:04,989 --> 01:19:08,389
If you calculate the value
fuel, nets, repair - ...

847
01:19:08,509 --> 01:19:10,549
Then the fish ...
will cost a fortune.

848
01:19:10,669 --> 01:19:12,749
Just imagine
so this is just nonsense.

849
01:19:12,829 --> 01:19:14,869
Do you know how much
a coffee frappe?

850
01:19:14,949 --> 01:19:17,189
Now I'll tell ...
After all I do ...

851
01:19:17,909 --> 01:19:19,149
Here at ...

852
01:19:19,229 --> 01:19:22,749
You're also a mechanic? ..
How romantic ...

853
01:19:30,069 --> 01:19:31,629
Talk between the read, ..

854
01:19:31,709 --> 01:19:34,549
Itself ... that remotirate bike?

855
01:19:34,669 --> 01:19:38,149
And anywhere that you have not learned ...
For us this is long gone.

856
01:19:38,229 --> 01:19:41,269
I think you just have ...
gold hands.

857
01:19:44,309 --> 01:19:46,389
And you are here
- We're not.

858
01:19:47,509 --> 01:19:50,389
How went the rehearsal?
- Cool.

859
01:19:54,509 --> 01:19:58,349
I'm leaving.
- Thank you for interesting conversation.

860
01:19:58,469 --> 01:19:59,549
Yep.

861
01:20:00,909 --> 01:20:03,309
Did you find something?
- Treated it is ..

862
01:20:03,389 --> 01:20:06,509
I found drugs and that's what ...
I lied that is

863
01:20:06,589 --> 01:20:08,149
And what does that mean?

864
01:20:08,229 --> 01:20:10,829
If it is treated,
Nikostratos may be alive.

865
01:20:10,909 --> 01:20:14,109
Just do not worry,
there is insufficient evidence.

866
01:20:14,189 --> 01:20:17,389
Your father was Lucullus ...
but obviously it has not healed.

867
01:20:17,509 --> 01:20:19,629
But what disappears?
Here is the answer.

868
01:20:19,709 --> 01:20:22,469
In nothing sure.
- Listen ...

869
01:20:23,309 --> 01:20:25,469
I am confident that swim to it.

870
01:20:25,949 --> 01:20:27,109

In order not to drive them to suffer.

I was not confident that it will heal.
It was probably not happen.
