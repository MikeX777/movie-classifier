1
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:41,930
Can you take a break from
your phone for a second?

2
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:47,001
Sorry. Vinny wanted me to
show a house this weekend.

3
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:49,768
Calvin, you can't.
We're going up to the cabin.

4
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:54,173
I know. That's what
I'm telling him. See?

5
00:02:58,111 --> 00:02:59,378
Great.

6
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,971
Listen, honey. I... I know you're
nervous about seeing her again

7
00:03:04,071 --> 00:03:07,853
but you don't have to worry.
I'm here for you.

8
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,693
And I'm sure it'll be fine.
Just like old times.

9
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:14,795
That's what I'm afraid of.

10
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:18,597
So, tell me what she's like.

11
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:22,369
I don't really know.
I don't even talk to her that much.

12
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:24,303
I mean, when you were younger.

13
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,740
Well, we were both kind of rebellious.

14
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:32,446
You? Rebellious?

15
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:35,380
- In my own way.
- Yeah, sure.

16
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,317
I will believe when I see it.

17
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:42,154
Oh, my God! That's her.

18
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:04,171
- Rebecca, are you all right?
- Yeah, it's just...

19
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:06,173
Not much has changed.

20
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:08,573
How old were you last
time you were here?

21
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:11,743
- I don't know. Maybe...
- 16.

22
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:14,982
So, what's the plan?

23
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:18,319
Maybe we should get unpacked.
And settled.

24
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:20,754
No. I wanna do this first.

25
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:23,021
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

26
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,431
You sure you want me here?

27
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:42,307
You can go first if you want.

28
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:45,743
No. It's okay.

29
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:48,112
You were closer to her.

30
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:53,716
Mom,

31
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,589
I've never had to deal
with life without you.

32
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:01,796
Every memory I have,
you're there with me.

33
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:06,197
When dad died, you were the
one who rocked me to sleep.

34
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:11,069
I know how much this place meant to you.

35
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:13,872
To us.

36
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,376
Here, you say something.

37
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,688
This is the closest I've
been to mom in 12 years.

38
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:29,447
Can you believe this is the first time
I've been up here? After all this time.

39
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:35,823
It's a nice place.
I always wanted a cabin growing up,

40
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:39,891
my family was poor as dirt.
I was lucky if I got to go camping.

41
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,962
So, you're in real estate?

42
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:50,637
I'm... still fairly new at it.
But I... I think I've got what it takes.

43
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:53,405
There's... It's good money in it.

44
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,711
- And Abby?
- She's in marketing for a record company.

45
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:02,816
Indie bands, small label. Very hip.

46
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,117
She's... she's good at it too.

47
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:08,287
So, what do you do?

48
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,193
Hey, how was your shower, babe?

49
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:15,630
Amazing, as long as you
don't like water pressure.

50
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,899
- Who does?
- What you got there?

51
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:24,272
It's my old knife. From Girl Scouts.
I thought I had lost it.

52
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:28,676
So, what have you been telling
your fiance about me?

53
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:33,881
- Why? What were you two talking about?
- We were just chatting.

54
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:38,885
Actually, Abby told me you two were a
couple of hell raisers back in the day.

55
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:43,324
- I never said that.
- Yes, you did. You told me this morning.

56
00:08:43,424 --> 00:08:47,027
Yeah, Abby was a real rebel.
Remember you got a B- in Algebra?

57
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:48,862
- She cried for two days.
- That didn't happen.

58
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:52,633
Yes, it did. You thought Mr. Zolinsky
was disappointed in you.

59
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:55,530
Okay, so I should have
punched him in the face

60
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,671
like you did and punish
him for my bad grade.

61
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,241
- Okay, you remember that.
- Yeah.

62
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:04,345
- You punched a teacher in the face?
- No, not exactly.

63
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:06,680
Yeah, it was more like,
just his right eye.

64
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,748
Wow, that's bad ass.

65
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:15,320
- I never punched a teacher in the face.
- Don't worry. There's still time.

66
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:22,062
Honey, you look a little empty handed.

67
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:24,729
- How about some wine?
- Yes. Thank you.

68
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,000
So...

69
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:34,741
How are things in Louisville?
How's Aunt Linda doing these days?

70
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:38,145
She's okay. Do you talk her much?

71
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:41,746
No, not in long time.
I was getting sick of her lectures.

72
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,919
- She's still a little off?
- Yeah.

73
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:50,314
It's getting worse as she gets older.
She was there for us though,

74
00:09:50,414 --> 00:09:54,025
when mom got sick. So, that's something.

75
00:09:56,295 --> 00:10:01,101
Well, we're glad you're here.
Feels weird though. Doesn't it?

76
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:05,773
Yeah. It's... I don't know.
I don't know what to think.

77
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:09,176
Are you doing okay? You seem okay.

78
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:12,413
If you ever feel like you wanna leave,
just let us know.

79
00:10:12,513 --> 00:10:14,646
No, this is good.

80
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:17,015
I should be here.

81
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:22,022
My therapist in Louisville told me I
should come back and face this place,

82
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,456
if I had any hope of putting
what happened behind me.

83
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,592
Well, we're here for you.

84
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:50,081
You were acting a
little strange tonight.

85
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,517
Was I?

86
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:57,755
Come on, Calvin.
You seemed pretty uptight around her.

87
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:04,095
I still remember when you were afraid
that corner store guy didn't like you.

88
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:07,732
Yeah, he was a tough nut to crack.

89
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:12,776
Seriously.

90
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:15,099
What's going on?

91
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:20,311
You know, you never talk about it.

92
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:23,570
About what happened to Rebecca.

93
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,691
We're going to get married next year.
And you have to trust me.

94
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:31,955
It's not that.

95
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:33,927
Just...

96
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:37,862
It's just a messed up situation.
I don't like to talk about it.

97
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,867
I understand.

98
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:45,670
But she's here now. So maybe,
you should let me in on this.

99
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,162
Well...

100
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,285
You know, she was kidnapped. And...

101
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:04,455
Yeah, I remember all that.

102
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:08,759
- Her boyfriend, right?
- Chuck.

103
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:14,465
- And she tried to kill herself?
- No.

104
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,066
Not right away.

105
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,674
There was something else.

106
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:24,275
They never reported. Mom kept it quiet.

107
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:28,146
When they found her,

108
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,719
she was pregnant.

109
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:35,620
Mom made her get a... abortion.

110
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,475
Oh, my God.

111
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:45,696
I am so sorry.

112
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,704
We don't have to talk about this if you
don't want to. I'm sorry I brought it up.

113
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:53,227
No, it's not that. It's just...

114
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,485
Calvin, it was my fault.

115
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,846
No.

116
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,813
No, Abby, that is not true.

117
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:07,618
We were up here for the weekend.
We were close, then.

118
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:13,257
Then, we had this huge
fight about Chuck.

119
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,560
I knew he was a scumbag and I...

120
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:20,834
I wouldn't leave it alone.
And we were screaming at each other,

121
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:23,834
and then she ran off
into the woods and I...

122
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:30,077
I didn't see again until after
the search party found her.

123
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:34,815
Abby, it's not your fault.
You couldn't have known.

124
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:38,716
If I hadn't chased her away,
it wouldn't have happened.

125
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,173
Abby, that's not true.

126
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:45,025
Chuck was obviously a psychopath.

127
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:48,826
If it didn't happen then, it could
have happened another time.

128
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:54,465
Great. That makes me
feel so much better.

129
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:01,772
I didn't mean it like that.

130
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:09,580
You're a great motivational speaker.

131
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:19,423
I... I know this is a
horrible situation,

132
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,792
but...

133
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:24,862
At least, Rebecca is here now.

134
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,631
With us.

135
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:33,270
We'll do everything we can, for her.

136
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,208
We'll make it work.

137
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:41,745
The worst is behind her.

138
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:46,884
We can be a family.

139
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:23,521
How are you, happy camper?

140
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:29,296
City slickers won't leave me be. They know
not the meaning of a true vacation.

141
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:33,097
Speaking of which, thought you said you
wouldn't work while we were up here?

142
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,697
Honey.

143
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,277
No. I'll get her.

144
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:47,712
- Sure?
- Yeah. Go back to work.

145
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,280
Rebecca?

146
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:51,102
Okay.

147
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,250
Rebecca?

148
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:08,199
Rebecca?

149
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:15,773
Rebecca!

150
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:22,482
Rebecca? What is the matter?

151
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:25,151
Sorry. I just...

152
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:27,921
Something about this place
reminds me of that night.

153
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:30,857
What did your doctor tell you?
To take a tour down memory lane?

154
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:32,826
Doesn't he understand
what you went through?

155
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:35,662
You don't understand.
It's not that simple.

156
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:37,928
Then lay it out for me.

157
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,699
I had to come up here.
I can't explain it.

158
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:47,438
Don't you worry about anything.

159
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:51,845
What happened is in the past. I'm here now
and we're gonna get through this together.

160
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:56,781
I know you wanna help me,
but you don't know what I've seen.

161
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:02,120
What is that?

162
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:22,807
- What happened here?
- Let's go back.

163
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,932
It's really light.
There must have been a plane crash.

164
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:49,634
- Abby, I don't know...
- Looks like it happened recently.

165
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:12,423
We shouldn't be here.

166
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:19,964
Abby...

167
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,665
Rebecca?

168
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:52,963
- Did you see it?
- Yeah, it's definitely a crash.

169
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,878
Not sure about this, though.

170
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:59,603
Do you think it was a bad
idea we came up here?

171
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,476
It's too late to worry about that now.

172
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:05,779
We just have to deal with
the situation as it stands.

173
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:09,149
Yeah. I guess so.

174
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:11,484
I just wish I knew why she freaked out.

175
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:14,789
What she went through was traumatic.
I don't think she was ready to face it.

176
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:18,658
Calvin, just because you took
those online psychology courses,

177
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:21,425
doesn't mean that you can
cross-analyze everyone.

178
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:24,128
Jesus, Abby. Calm down.

179
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,532
Sorry.

180
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:28,498
It's just...

181
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:32,036
- It's been a stressful day.
- How's Rebecca doing?

182
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:35,939
I gave her something to help her sleep.

183
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:39,777
Rest is probably the
best thing right now.

184
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,640
How are you feeling?

185
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:11,573
Okay.

186
00:20:11,673 --> 00:20:15,215
Are you hungry? Do you wanna
get up and stretch your legs?

187
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:17,217
We shouldn't have gone up there.

188
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:22,086
- Becca, what's bothering you?
- We weren't meant to find that.

189
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:29,660
You brought that back?

190
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:34,832
- We have to get rid of that, right now.
- Becca, calm down.

191
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:36,870
What's the big deal?

192
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,573
- I don't want it around me.
- Calvin, get it out of here.

193
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:42,273
- Get it away from me.
- Calvin, now.

194
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,475
Okay.

195
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:49,983
It's okay. It's gone.
Now, what's gotten into you?

196
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,285
We shouldn't have come back here.
This was a mistake.

197
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:56,990
Becca, I don't understand why you're acting
like this. Nothing happened up there.

198
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,523
Everything happened up there.

199
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:11,869
It's beautiful out here.

200
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:14,476
Yeah.

201
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:20,280
It's okay, honey.

202
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:24,381
She's gonna be fine.
It's just a transition period.

203
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:26,183
You think so?

204
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,189
After what she's been through?

205
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:33,991
Plus your mom sheltered her after
everything that happened, right?

206
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,863
That's what I used to think, but...

207
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:39,930
Or maybe mom was just
trying to protect her.

208
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:44,971
No. Abby, don't start thinking that way.

209
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:48,933
It's better that Rebecca faces this now and
learns how to stand on her own two feet.

210
00:21:49,033 --> 00:21:50,874
We can help her do that.

211
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:53,650
Maybe you're right.

212
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,551
I like hearing that.

213
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,687
Don't hear it too often.

214
00:22:00,787 --> 00:22:05,088
That's because it's not
true all that often.

215
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:11,695
I really appreciate you being
here for me. And Rebecca.

216
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,598
Of course.

217
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,434
I love you.

218
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:30,000
Hello?

219
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:32,803
Becca, is that you?

220
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:43,180
What do you want?

221
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:49,253
We have to leave this place.

222
00:25:00,231 --> 00:25:01,726
Calvin.

223
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:06,539
- Rebecca, Good Morning.
- Good morning. Where's Abby?

224
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:10,874
She's... She's out at the car.
Organizing.

225
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,746
- You feeling any better?
- Organizing?

226
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:17,881
Yeah, we packed up our stuff
this morning. We're going home.

227
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:44,877
Abby?

228
00:25:44,977 --> 00:25:47,947
Oh, sweetie. How're you feeling?

229
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:50,683
- Okay, I guess.
- Good.

230
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:54,253
I know you packed light, so I
figured we'd just eat on the road.

231
00:25:54,353 --> 00:25:56,589
Why are you in such a rush?

232
00:25:56,689 --> 00:25:58,958
Last night, you were the
one who was in a rush.

233
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:00,726
What are you talking about?

234
00:26:00,826 --> 00:26:03,129
You came into my room
and said we had to leave.

235
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:05,431
What do you mean?
I slept the whole night.

236
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:08,766
No, I... I walked you
out my room, and...

237
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:12,169
And then...

238
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:19,078
Okay. Whatever. Sounds like you
had the most boring dream ever.

239
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:21,111
I'll go get my bag.

240
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:03,155
- This is such a nice place, Abby.
- We just bought it.

241
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:06,992
It was our first act as a
soon-to-be-married couple.

242
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:08,561
Looks expensive.

243
00:27:08,661 --> 00:27:12,231
Well, it was a little bit of a stretch.
But Calvin got us a really good deal.

244
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:14,701
The guest room is all set up for you.

245
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:17,370
Yeah. I... I'll show it to you.
You'll be really comfortable there.

246
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:21,974
Thank you so much, you two. I really
appreciate how welcoming you've been.

247
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:24,441
Don't mention it. You're family.

248
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,499
Hey, what's going on down here?

249
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:54,840
Calvin? Oh, my God,
you brought that home?

250
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,708
Abby, you've...
You've got to check this out.

251
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,655
The table's uneven, right?

252
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:14,593
Lift the edge of the table.

253
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,863
- Why?
- Just... grab the edge. Lift it.

254
00:28:17,963 --> 00:28:20,397
Hey, what are you guys doing?

255
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:22,969
Is that what I think it is?

256
00:28:24,029 --> 00:28:26,372
I'm sorry, sweetie. I didn't know.

257
00:28:26,472 --> 00:28:31,474
It was... It was totally me.
This thing is...

258
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:37,047
I have never seen anything like it.

259
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:41,751
- Well, what do you think it is?
- I don't know.

260
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,657
But that was a crash out there, right?

261
00:28:44,757 --> 00:28:48,725
Well, every plane has
to have a black box.

262
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:51,395
A black box?

263
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:56,268
Yeah. They're indestructible.

264
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:59,171
They record everything
that happens to a plane.

265
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:01,538
They come in handy when one goes down.

266
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:06,910
The engineers study it. Find out what
happened that caused the accident.

267
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:08,679
So, it's a black box?

268
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:11,083
I don't know.

269
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:13,486
Shouldn't it look like a box?

270
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:17,587
I... I don't know.
It could be some new model.

271
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,994
Why did you want me to lift the table?

272
00:29:23,302 --> 00:29:25,998
I was just doing some tests,

273
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:29,201
but... If it's gonna bother anyone...

274
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:31,902
you know, we don't have to.

275
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:36,609
- Do what you were gonna do.
- All right, Abby.

276
00:29:36,709 --> 00:29:40,143
Grab the edge of the table
and lift it to make an incline.

277
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:44,597
Little higher.

278
00:29:54,527 --> 00:29:55,728
What the fuck?

279
00:29:55,828 --> 00:29:59,198
That is not a black box.
You shouldn't have brought that here.

280
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:02,702
It's just a fucking black ball.
Who knows what it is?

281
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:05,671
That is exactly why you
shouldn't have taken it.

282
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:07,807
What if it is a military thing?

283
00:30:07,907 --> 00:30:11,544
Absolutely. It could be something
experimental. A prototype.

284
00:30:11,844 --> 00:30:14,480
So, why do we want that?

285
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,316
- What if it's worth something?
- So it's about the money?

286
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:19,251
I don't know but it
could be worth a lot.

287
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:21,752
And if it isn't, I just
wanna know what it is.

288
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:24,121
What if it's dangerous?

289
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:28,127
Dangerous how?
That you might step on it and slip?

290
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:30,496
What if it's radioactive or something?

291
00:30:30,596 --> 00:30:32,765
- Are you kidding me right now?
- I don't know.

292
00:30:32,865 --> 00:30:36,235
Listen, it's fine. I promise.

293
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:41,006
If at any time, it seems like it might
be dangerous, we'll contact the authorities.

294
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:44,176
- The authorities?
- The police.

295
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:47,747
The fucking army. Whatever.
We'll hand it right off.

296
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:51,243
But it might be worth something
and how will we know unless

297
00:30:51,343 --> 00:30:53,917
we find out what it is first?

298
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:59,792
This could be good for us.

299
00:30:59,892 --> 00:31:02,492
Help pay for this house
that you love so much.

300
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:11,470
Okay. If it seems dangerous
at any point, it's gone.

301
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,770
- Abby.
- It's fine.

302
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:21,979
Now, I'm not scared of...
Whatever it is.

303
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,482
Neither am I.

304
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,045
Rebecca?

305
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:17,961
Calvin? Calvin? Calvin!

306
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:23,002
Honey, what's wrong?

307
00:33:23,102 --> 00:33:24,521
I...

308
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:27,604
My God... I had a nightmare.

309
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:32,957
It's okay.

310
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:37,347
You're awake now.

311
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,794
So, nobody knocked these over?

312
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:53,566
Honey, I swear.

313
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:56,602
As much as I like to avoid
incurring the wrath of Abby,

314
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:58,702
I would not lie about this one.

315
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:02,005
I didn't do it.

316
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:06,009
Oh, my God. I'm really gonna be late.
Vinny's gonna kill me.

317
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:09,649
- Have a good day at work, honey.
- You too. Love you.

318
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:13,519
Oh, Rebecca, feel free to dig into the
books or movies if you get bored.

319
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:15,953
Thanks. See you later.

320
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:19,291
I gotta go too. I'm sorry
it's so busy this morning.

321
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:21,525
I didn't sleep well last night,
I lost track of time.

322
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:23,829
- It's fine.
- If you need anything, call me.

323
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:26,229
And if you can't get a hold of me,
Calvin's number is on the fridge.

324
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:27,597
All right.

325
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,152
Just make yourself at home.

326
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:52,589
- Thank you.
- Yup.

327
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:33,756
Hello.

328
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:35,692
<i>Abby.</i>

329
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,198
Wow! Hi, Aunt Linda.

330
00:36:39,298 --> 00:36:43,236
Been a while since we've spoken.
What's up?

331
00:36:43,336 --> 00:36:47,137
<i>I was checking in on Rebecca.
She hasn't been answering her phone.</i>

332
00:36:48,473 --> 00:36:51,543
Well, she's been doing great.

333
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:53,579
Really great. I love having her here.

334
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:56,479
- It's just like old...
<i>- And your mother's ashes?</i>

335
00:36:59,418 --> 00:37:02,621
We took care of that right away.
Rebecca and I did it together.

336
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:03,756
<i>Good.</i>

337
00:37:03,856 --> 00:37:07,159
We took them up to the old cabin
and we spread them out on the...

338
00:37:07,259 --> 00:37:09,192
<i>You did what?</i>

339
00:37:12,206 --> 00:37:15,464
We poured them into
the lake at the cabin.

340
00:37:18,136 --> 00:37:21,874
- Aunt Linda?
<i>- What did you think you were doing?</i>

341
00:37:21,974 --> 00:37:25,744
- I don't understand?
<i>- Send Rebecca home, on the next bus.</i>

342
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:28,514
<i>You have done enough,
don't cause her any more pain.</i>

343
00:37:28,614 --> 00:37:30,582
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

344
00:37:30,682 --> 00:37:32,818
<i>You should never have
taken her up there.</i>

345
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:35,320
- What are you...
<i>- Send her back home before it's too late.</i>

346
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:38,721
- What are you talking about?
<i>- Abby, send her home.</i>

347
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:44,227
Hey! What was that about?
Sounded serious.

348
00:37:46,662 --> 00:37:50,102
It was nothing. A solicitor.

349
00:37:50,402 --> 00:37:53,705
Yeah, mom used to curse
those guys out too.

350
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:55,207
How was work?

351
00:37:55,307 --> 00:37:57,040
- It was good.
- Good.

352
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,545
When do you have to
get back to Louisville?

353
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,248
I don't know. I bought a one-way ticket.

354
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:17,393
- Check this out!
- Calvin!

355
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,799
Not a scratch on it.

356
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:25,504
And that tells us what?

357
00:38:25,904 --> 00:38:29,605
- That should've taken a chunk out of it.
- But it didn't.

358
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:33,977
Calvin, it's almost time for dinner.
Can we please go upstairs?

359
00:40:29,494 --> 00:40:31,530
Oh, Jesus!

360
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:34,297
Sorry, I thought you heard
me coming down the stairs.

361
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:36,936
What are you doing?

362
00:40:37,436 --> 00:40:40,603
I couldn't sleep.
Is everything all right?

363
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,608
I just...

364
00:40:42,708 --> 00:40:45,374
Had another weird dream.

365
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,810
What was it?

366
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:51,648
I don't know. Just weird.

367
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:55,117
I haven't been feeling too well, lately.

368
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:57,389
Yeah, I'm gonna call
Dr. Lieberman in the morning,

369
00:40:57,489 --> 00:41:00,359
see if he will squeeze
me in for a checkup.

370
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:02,994
Yeah, I bet he'd like to squeeze you in.

371
00:41:03,518 --> 00:41:05,364
Calvin, shut up.

372
00:41:05,464 --> 00:41:08,209
You are the only woman I know
that can get a doctor's appointment

373
00:41:08,309 --> 00:41:12,068
on the same day she calls.
Why do you think that is?

374
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:18,274
You have a headache?

375
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:23,346
Yeah, my head has been hurting
me the past couple of days.

376
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:27,049
What if it's that thing?

377
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:31,890
Nah, that doesn't make any sense.

378
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,925
You've been spending a lot
of time down here lately,

379
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:36,492
maybe it has something to do with it.

380
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:39,998
No, not my...

381
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:44,400
My head's been bugging me for a
couple of weeks, before the cabin.

382
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,937
You just said it was
only a couple of days.

383
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:53,509
I know.

384
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:56,880
Yeah, I'm sorry.

385
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:00,285
I didn't want to worry you.

386
00:42:00,585 --> 00:42:03,421
Calvin, you have to
tell me these things.

387
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,955
I do worry about you.

388
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:10,960
I'm gonna get you an appointment
with the doctor tomorrow, too.

389
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,864
Okay.

390
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:19,537
Come to bed soon, please.

391
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,464
Okay, Abby. Looked at your charts.

392
00:42:45,564 --> 00:42:49,801
- Any good news, doctor?
- Maybe.

393
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:53,736
So you say you've been feeling
sick the past week or so.

394
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:55,438
Yeah, sort of nauseated.

395
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:59,942
Does it tend to come on
stronger in the morning?

396
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:03,312
Like a morning sickness?

397
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:06,449
I suppose.

398
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:12,521
Wait, are you saying what
I think you are saying?

399
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:21,230
<i>We're sorry, your call...</i>

400
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:32,008
- Wow! That was a waste of time.
- What?

401
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:33,279
Well...

402
00:43:33,379 --> 00:43:37,048
Apparently the medical community is fairly
impotent when it comes to headaches.

403
00:43:37,148 --> 00:43:40,116
They told me to take two aspirin,
like I don't know that.

404
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:42,254
They didn't say anything else?

405
00:43:42,554 --> 00:43:45,472
There wasn't much to say.
I took a full physical instead.

406
00:43:45,572 --> 00:43:49,261
They said it was overdue.
How was your appointment dear?

407
00:43:49,361 --> 00:43:52,561
The good doctor was happy
to see you, I'm sure.

408
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:55,431
He said I was pregnant.

409
00:43:57,234 --> 00:43:58,701
What?

410
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:05,241
- Really?
- Yeah.

411
00:44:06,544 --> 00:44:08,644
Honey, that's great.

412
00:44:09,112 --> 00:44:11,917
- Really?
- Oh, my God. Yeah!

413
00:44:12,017 --> 00:44:15,453
Okay, I can see you are
excited but what about work?

414
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,957
What about work?
They have maternity leave, right?

415
00:44:19,057 --> 00:44:21,560
I'll put in some more hours...

416
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,595
Push some more properties,
I can make enough for both of us.

417
00:44:23,695 --> 00:44:25,597
Calvin, I like where I am
at with my job right now.

418
00:44:25,697 --> 00:44:28,567
What if months of maternity
leave jeopardizes my position?

419
00:44:28,667 --> 00:44:32,404
Listen, honey, I know how important
landing that job was to you.

420
00:44:32,504 --> 00:44:36,405
But this, is a baby we're
talking about here.

421
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:39,809
Our baby.

422
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:43,948
And with everything that's happened lately,
your mother passing away,

423
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:47,085
and your sister coming to stay with us.
Hasn't it made you think?

424
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:50,755
- Think about what?
- Just about family.

425
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:54,457
About how important it is,
and how little of it we have left.

426
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,529
I'm excited about starting
a family with you.

427
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:05,702
Just feel lucky you don't have to carry
our family around in your uterus.

428
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,804
I don't have a uterus.

429
00:45:09,474 --> 00:45:13,009
But, I will carry you wherever you want.

430
00:47:11,764 --> 00:47:13,829
What the fuck?

431
00:47:15,542 --> 00:47:19,301
Oh, God! What are you doing?

432
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:22,073
Sorry. Are you okay?

433
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:25,577
Where were you?
Don't you know how late it is?

434
00:47:25,677 --> 00:47:27,746
What's wrong?

435
00:47:28,046 --> 00:47:31,013
Why did you put that
thing under the bed?

436
00:47:31,381 --> 00:47:32,584
What are you talking about?

437
00:47:32,684 --> 00:47:35,184
This stupid sphere.
Why did you put it under the bed?

438
00:47:40,124 --> 00:47:44,193
- Calvin, I want it gone.
- Don't be ridiculous.

439
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:46,896
What did you just say to me?

440
00:47:50,968 --> 00:47:52,868
Look, I...

441
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:59,110
I just mean, that this thing is harmless.
We still don't know what it is.

442
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,780
Calvin, are you even
listening to yourself?

443
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,014
You just said we don't know what it is,
so how can you know that it's harmless.

444
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:08,551
What's going on?
Why are you acting like this?

445
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:11,689
I'm having nightmares.

446
00:48:11,789 --> 00:48:13,892
Yeah, I know.

447
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:17,093
They say that can happen in
the early stages of pregnancy.

448
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:21,397
Like the ones I've been having?
I don't think so.

449
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:24,434
No. Really.

450
00:48:26,003 --> 00:48:29,474
Vivid dreams or nightmares

451
00:48:29,574 --> 00:48:32,041
can be the product of all the
hormones from the baby.

452
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:35,477
How do you know this?

453
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:40,649
Well... You know all those
pamphlets Dr. Lieberman gave us?

454
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:43,185
I've been reading them.

455
00:48:43,821 --> 00:48:45,616
Really?

456
00:48:46,523 --> 00:48:49,361
Yeah. Honey, I know that you're scared.

457
00:48:49,961 --> 00:48:52,764
But you don't have to
go through this alone.

458
00:48:52,864 --> 00:48:57,199
I may not be experiencing exactly
what you are, but I can help you.

459
00:48:57,868 --> 00:49:00,369
I still want that thing gone.

460
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,438
I don't like it.

461
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:06,953
Okay.

462
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:12,948
I promise.

463
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:29,332
You're quite the cook?

464
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,371
What is that supposed to mean?

465
00:49:32,971 --> 00:49:36,372
Nothing. It's just nice to know
that some things never change.

466
00:49:38,843 --> 00:49:42,547
I am sorry for taking the time
of cooking you breakfast.

467
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:44,883
Relax, Abby. I was just kidding.

468
00:49:44,983 --> 00:49:47,919
Yeah. You and Calvin are always kidding.

469
00:49:48,019 --> 00:49:50,686
Maybe I'm not in the mood
for anymore fucking jokes.

470
00:49:51,355 --> 00:49:53,892
Jesus! Sorry.

471
00:49:53,992 --> 00:49:56,561
Next time, give me a heads up
when you're in a bad mood.

472
00:49:56,661 --> 00:50:01,232
You know, my therapist says it's not healthy
to take out your frustrations on others.

473
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:03,902
Well, we all don't have the luxury
of running away to Kentucky,

474
00:50:04,002 --> 00:50:06,102
every time something goes wrong.

475
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,472
Is that what you think happened?

476
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:14,045
You think we left it all behind
and everything got better?

477
00:50:14,245 --> 00:50:16,679
It must have helped,
or you wouldn't have done it.

478
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:23,183
I'm sorry, Becca.

479
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:28,958
I understand... I guess.

480
00:50:30,294 --> 00:50:33,098
If my boyfriend did to me
what Chuck did to you,

481
00:50:33,398 --> 00:50:36,232
- I would have run away, too.
- Abby, none of that happened.

482
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:40,972
- What are you saying?
- Chuck didn't rape me.

483
00:50:41,172 --> 00:50:44,342
Of course, it happened.
You were pregnant.

484
00:50:44,442 --> 00:50:47,946
I didn't know what happened
during the time I was missing.

485
00:50:48,046 --> 00:50:51,349
I didn't remember. Not at first.

486
00:50:51,449 --> 00:50:53,952
Becca, what's going on?

487
00:50:54,052 --> 00:50:57,653
You made me so angry that night...

488
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:02,958
telling me what I could and couldn't do.
I ran away wishing you weren't my sister.

489
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:08,967
I walked through the woods,

490
00:51:09,067 --> 00:51:12,000
to Sal's gas station
out on the main road.

491
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:15,837
Called Chuck to come and get me.

492
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:22,513
He showed up a little
while later and... we talked.

493
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:25,283
Parked by the side of the road.

494
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:29,418
He was sorry that you and
I were fighting about him.

495
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:34,489
He really wasn't such a bad guy.

496
00:51:36,526 --> 00:51:39,027
But then something happened.

497
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:42,233
And the lights in the dashboard died.

498
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:45,837
I thought maybe we had been sitting
on the side of the road too long.

499
00:51:45,937 --> 00:51:50,791
Killed the battery, you know?
But, Chuck wasn't so sure.

500
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:54,977
When the lights came back on,
he started up the car.

501
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:59,717
It seemed like he wanted to get
us back into town in a hurry.

502
00:51:59,817 --> 00:52:03,788
We took McLusky Road, as a shortcut.

503
00:52:03,888 --> 00:52:07,789
We were so close to the cabin.
I thought you might see us.

504
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:12,795
There was no light out there.

505
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:16,832
Just what we could
see in the headlights.

506
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:23,806
We went up this incline, and when we
came down the other side, there was...

507
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:27,476
What?

508
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:31,146
Abby, there were three...

509
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:33,715
Three what?

510
00:52:36,353 --> 00:52:40,058
I'm sorry. Maybe we shouldn't
talk about this right now.

511
00:52:40,158 --> 00:52:43,661
Becca, we've been not talking
about this for 12 years.

512
00:52:43,761 --> 00:52:46,829
I think it's way past time when
we started talking about it.

513
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,533
Abby, there were three UFOs.

514
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:57,806
UFOs?

515
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:02,914
- Like, flying saucers?
- I know you know what UFOs are.

516
00:53:03,014 --> 00:53:05,249
You used to love the <i>X Files.</i>

517
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:08,850
Yeah, but I didn't believe.

518
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:15,357
We saw them. Chuck hit the brakes
hard and then the car just, died.

519
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:20,462
I started screaming.

520
00:53:20,897 --> 00:53:22,464
I couldn't stop.

521
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:27,035
I've never been so
scared in my whole life.

522
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,775
No, I don't know what to do with this.

523
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:37,916
I can't... I can't think
about this right now.

524
00:53:38,116 --> 00:53:42,220
- Abby...
- That is just a lot to take in.

525
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,886
I'm not really sure I...

526
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:47,456
You should sit down.

527
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:51,760
Why didn't anybody tell me this before?

528
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:54,396
It took a lot of time.

529
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:57,635
A lot of therapy to start remembering.

530
00:53:57,735 --> 00:54:00,235
So what did mom think?

531
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,672
She knew about this?

532
00:54:05,442 --> 00:54:09,111
Apparently, I was babbling about
this shit when she found me.

533
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:18,589
When Chuck never showed back up,
everyone else said I was out of my head.

534
00:54:18,689 --> 00:54:22,824
And that what really happened is
that he kidnapped and raped me.

535
00:54:25,162 --> 00:54:27,596
But mom believed me.

536
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:30,735
Even when I didn't fully
remember what happened.

537
00:54:30,835 --> 00:54:33,769
She trusted what she had seen in my
eyes when they first found me.

538
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:38,039
What about the baby?

539
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:41,512
I'd been with Chuck before.

540
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:45,947
I didn't even know I was pregnant until
after they found me and ran tests.

541
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:50,018
After everything happened, I was...

542
00:54:51,655 --> 00:54:54,322
I just couldn't think straight.

543
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:58,860
I guess I believed what
they said was true and...

544
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:02,431
I let mom convince me to...

545
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:04,633
Get the...

546
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,741
What happened after the car died?

547
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:18,647
There were these horrible creatures.

548
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,552
Not little green men at all.

549
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:28,890
They came out of their
ships and they took us.

550
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:33,862
We couldn't fight back. We were frozen.

551
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:36,167
What happened to Chuck?

552
00:55:36,267 --> 00:55:39,000
They took Chuck away.

553
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:46,007
I heard him screaming,
but I never saw him again.

554
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:53,849
Abby, I'm so sorry.

555
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:56,287
I wish I had had the
guts to tell you sooner.

556
00:55:56,387 --> 00:55:58,620
Mom said we should never
talk about it with anyone.

557
00:56:02,941 --> 00:56:04,960
It's just the baby.

558
00:56:06,096 --> 00:56:08,499
I'm gonna go lay down for a while.

559
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:10,668
You don't wanna talk about this anymore?

560
00:56:10,768 --> 00:56:14,469
Becca, just let me go and lay down.

561
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:21,343
Who's running away, now?

562
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:38,496
- Hey, you're finally home.
- Where's Abby?

563
00:56:38,796 --> 00:56:41,832
She's been resting most of the day.
She hasn't been feeling well.

564
00:56:41,932 --> 00:56:45,133
Thanks for taking care of her.
I'll be in the basement.

565
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:48,570
So, what are you doing down there?

566
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:04,553
No, no, no, no.

567
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,989
I can't.

568
00:57:09,293 --> 00:57:13,562
They're family. We have a family.
It's our family.

569
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:19,501
I can't do it.

570
00:57:20,804 --> 00:57:22,568
I won't.

571
00:57:25,308 --> 00:57:26,375
What test?

572
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:30,281
Well, if, but, If...

573
00:57:30,381 --> 00:57:34,283
If I can't, then, then who? Who?

574
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:38,153
It's not mine?

575
00:57:48,331 --> 00:57:50,932
No. Okay. Yeah.

576
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:49,725
No!

577
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:48,650
Calvin?

578
00:59:51,688 --> 00:59:53,254
Calvin!

579
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:58,429
Abby? What's wrong?

580
00:59:58,529 --> 01:00:00,097
Where's Calvin?

581
01:00:00,197 --> 01:00:02,199
I don't know. I haven't seen
him since I went to sleep.

582
01:00:02,299 --> 01:00:04,435
Is he in the house?

583
01:00:04,535 --> 01:00:06,101
Let me check.

584
01:00:10,206 --> 01:00:11,809
It looks like his car is gone.

585
01:00:12,209 --> 01:00:14,846
He's always gone when I need him.

586
01:00:15,546 --> 01:00:17,813
Okay. Well, I'm here.
Can you talk to me?

587
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:20,549
I had another nightmare.

588
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:23,854
Another?

589
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:27,224
I've been having them ever
since we were up at the cabin.

590
01:00:27,324 --> 01:00:33,130
There's bright lights, and then horrible
creatures and then they grab me, and...

591
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:36,965
I knew something was wrong.
We should have never gone up to the cabin.

592
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:38,536
What are you talking about?

593
01:00:38,636 --> 01:00:40,904
Mom told me that grandma
used to tell her stories

594
01:00:41,004 --> 01:00:43,474
about weird things happening in
the woods by the cabin, I just...

595
01:00:43,574 --> 01:00:47,177
Stop trying to put horrible things into
my head. The only reason I had the dream

596
01:00:47,277 --> 01:00:50,047
is because you've filled my mind
with a bunch of sci-fi bullshit.

597
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:53,751
I can't handle this.
I feel like I'm going crazy.

598
01:00:53,851 --> 01:00:55,820
No. Abby?

599
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:59,554
You're not going crazy.
Don't think that for a second.

600
01:01:00,089 --> 01:01:02,557
That's what they want you to think.

601
01:01:04,026 --> 01:01:06,397
I don't need this, Rebecca.

602
01:01:06,497 --> 01:01:10,935
This isn't helping. I just want Calvin.
Where is he?

603
01:01:11,735 --> 01:01:14,202
Last I saw, he was heading
for the basement.

604
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:19,307
Abby, wait.

605
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:31,453
He said he'd get rid of it.

606
01:01:35,558 --> 01:01:37,025
Abby?

607
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:38,929
Abby, what are you doing?

608
01:01:39,029 --> 01:01:41,365
If he won't get rid of it, I will.

609
01:01:41,465 --> 01:01:44,268
- Good. I'll go with you.
- Stay away from me, Rebecca.

610
01:01:44,368 --> 01:01:47,371
My life has been nothing but a
disaster since this thing showed up.

611
01:01:47,471 --> 01:01:48,973
You mean since I showed up.

612
01:01:49,473 --> 01:01:52,877
Well, I never would have found it,
if you didn't go crying off into the woods.

613
01:01:53,077 --> 01:01:55,577
I only ever do that when you are around.

614
01:02:55,204 --> 01:02:56,271
Rebecca?

615
01:02:59,742 --> 01:03:01,209
Becca.

616
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:13,190
Where's the sphere, Abby?

617
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:15,624
Fuck you. Where have you been all night?

618
01:03:16,225 --> 01:03:17,692
Where is it?

619
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:20,631
I got rid of it.

620
01:03:20,731 --> 01:03:23,599
Just like you said you
were going to. It's gone.

621
01:03:25,167 --> 01:03:26,834
What?

622
01:03:28,771 --> 01:03:31,706
Where is it? Abby, that...

623
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:33,208
sphere...

624
01:03:33,743 --> 01:03:35,279
Could make us rich.

625
01:03:35,379 --> 01:03:38,115
It's time to stop
fucking around, Calvin.

626
01:03:38,515 --> 01:03:40,751
There are more important
things to be worrying about,

627
01:03:40,851 --> 01:03:44,254
like all the time you're spending at work.
And in the basement.

628
01:03:44,354 --> 01:03:47,424
You told me that family was the
most important thing to you,

629
01:03:47,524 --> 01:03:52,262
but you're never around. And even when
you're here, you're not really here.

630
01:03:52,362 --> 01:03:55,598
How dare you talk to me about family?

631
01:03:55,698 --> 01:03:57,935
What's that supposed to mean?

632
01:03:58,035 --> 01:04:01,105
I got a call from Dr. Lieberman's
office this morning.

633
01:04:01,805 --> 01:04:03,972
Yeah, so? What did they say?

634
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:07,375
Abby,

635
01:04:08,811 --> 01:04:10,112
I'm sterile.

636
01:04:13,416 --> 01:04:17,084
- What are you saying?
- I'm fucking sterile.

637
01:04:18,788 --> 01:04:19,821
Sterile.

638
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:24,659
I can't have kids.

639
01:04:26,628 --> 01:04:29,164
It's not my baby, you fucking bitch.

640
01:04:31,067 --> 01:04:32,569
That's not possible.

641
01:04:32,669 --> 01:04:36,240
It is possible. It's more than possible.
It's a fucking fact.

642
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:40,510
It's science. I'm sterile.
It's not my baby.

643
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:42,045
So...

644
01:04:42,701 --> 01:04:44,713
You wanna talk?

645
01:04:45,581 --> 01:04:47,649
You wanna talk about family?

646
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:50,751
Come on. Let's talk.

647
01:04:51,687 --> 01:04:53,354
Whose is it?

648
01:04:53,956 --> 01:04:56,159
- It's yours.
- Yeah. Right.

649
01:04:56,259 --> 01:05:00,928
Whose is it? Somebody from
your fucking office? Who, Abby?

650
01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:02,199
Who?

651
01:05:02,599 --> 01:05:04,700
I've only been with you.

652
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,367
Right.

653
01:05:07,103 --> 01:05:08,936
Of course.

654
01:05:10,272 --> 01:05:13,407
Immaculate conception, I suppose.

655
01:05:13,876 --> 01:05:16,713
I am so honored.

656
01:05:16,813 --> 01:05:23,084
This baby, is really going
to be something special.

657
01:07:09,258 --> 01:07:10,861
<i>This is Linda Wallace.</i>

658
01:07:10,961 --> 01:07:12,629
- <i>I'm not here right now.</i>
- Shit!

659
01:07:12,729 --> 01:07:15,162
<i>Please leave a message after the beep.</i>

660
01:07:17,633 --> 01:07:19,468
Aunt Linda...

661
01:07:19,568 --> 01:07:22,503
It's me, again.

662
01:07:22,638 --> 01:07:24,205
Hey.

663
01:07:25,574 --> 01:07:28,242
I need to talk to you.

664
01:07:29,111 --> 01:07:31,746
I don't know what's happening, and...

665
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:34,481
Rebecca is gone.

666
01:07:35,084 --> 01:07:37,685
I think I'm going crazy.

667
01:07:39,255 --> 01:07:41,655
<i>Hello. Abby?</i>

668
01:07:41,924 --> 01:07:44,792
Aunt Linda, yeah. I'm here.

669
01:07:45,094 --> 01:07:47,028
<i>Where's Rebecca?</i>

670
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:49,266
I don't know.

671
01:07:49,366 --> 01:07:53,734
<i>I told you to send her home.
I knew something might happen.</i>

672
01:07:55,771 --> 01:07:58,505
She told me what happened.

673
01:07:59,441 --> 01:08:02,810
And... I've been having these...

674
01:08:03,212 --> 01:08:06,047
- dreams.
<i>- Abby, stop. I don't wanna hear it.</i>

675
01:08:06,448 --> 01:08:07,584
What?

676
01:08:07,684 --> 01:08:11,054
<i>Our family has dealt with a lot
of weird shit over the years.</i>

677
01:08:11,154 --> 01:08:16,090
<i>There's only way that we've been able
to cope. You don't talk about it.</i>

678
01:08:16,192 --> 01:08:19,030
- That's crazy.
<i>- Don't start with me, Abby.</i>

679
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:22,663
<i>It's not my fault you were too good
to see things for what they were.</i>

680
01:08:23,999 --> 01:08:26,500
<i>You were always too
good for the rest of us.</i>

681
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:30,774
<i>You want answers?
I'm not going to give them to you.</i>

682
01:08:30,874 --> 01:08:35,042
I don't know where Rebecca is.
So could you just give me something?

683
01:08:37,479 --> 01:08:39,213
<i>Dr. Sydney Mora.</i>

684
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:45,386
<i>He's the one who performed the abortion.
Go ahead and talk to him.</i>

685
01:09:42,244 --> 01:09:45,980
Well, what can I tell you
about my most famous patient?

686
01:09:46,915 --> 01:09:51,052
Rebecca... told me a story.

687
01:09:51,887 --> 01:09:54,521
I don't know what to believe, though.

688
01:09:54,957 --> 01:09:57,591
What, you don't believe your own sister?

689
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:00,027
She's unwell.

690
01:10:01,597 --> 01:10:06,000
All these things tend to...
run in the family.

691
01:10:07,403 --> 01:10:10,473
I can't find her and I thought if you
told me about what happened then,

692
01:10:10,573 --> 01:10:11,975
it may help me now.

693
01:10:12,075 --> 01:10:14,808
Well, frankly, I'm not
surprised that she's missing.

694
01:10:15,644 --> 01:10:17,811
I always thought they'd come back.

695
01:10:18,981 --> 01:10:20,884
With all the things
these visitors can do,

696
01:10:20,984 --> 01:10:24,487
I'm sure finding an old test
subject isn't very difficult.

697
01:10:24,587 --> 01:10:27,124
You're saying you believe in aliens?

698
01:10:27,224 --> 01:10:30,666
Well, you'd have to be a fool to not
believe that in this gigantic universe,

699
01:10:30,766 --> 01:10:32,762
there's no other intelligent life.

700
01:10:32,862 --> 01:10:35,765
Believing there's life elsewhere
in the universe is a lot different

701
01:10:35,865 --> 01:10:39,703
- than believing your sister was abducted.
- Believe what you like.

702
01:10:39,803 --> 01:10:44,105
So, when you saw Rebecca, your first
instinct was she had been abducted?

703
01:10:44,273 --> 01:10:46,674
No. Of course, not.

704
01:10:47,609 --> 01:10:48,912
Your mother brought her to me

705
01:10:49,012 --> 01:10:53,013
because she knew I would do what
needed to be done. I was discreet.

706
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:56,486
When she first walked
in here, she did tell me

707
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:59,687
what your sister had said
upon being discovered.

708
01:10:59,955 --> 01:11:02,389
She obviously believed her.

709
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:04,192
I had my doubts.

710
01:11:05,561 --> 01:11:08,531
That is until I saw Rebecca.

711
01:11:08,631 --> 01:11:12,602
- What did you find?
- She had bruises on her arms and legs.

712
01:11:12,702 --> 01:11:15,970
As though she had been held
down with great force.

713
01:11:17,339 --> 01:11:21,876
Now, in a kidnapping situation,
this would not seem out of the ordinary.

714
01:11:22,978 --> 01:11:24,601
But then I saw the cuts.

715
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:30,651
She had an incision on her torso that was
nearly healed when they brought her to me.

716
01:11:30,919 --> 01:11:33,657
But with the depth of the cut...

717
01:11:33,757 --> 01:11:37,295
Why, that would be impossible for,
for someone only missing a week.

718
01:11:38,395 --> 01:11:42,800
- I've never seen a cut.
- She also had a small incision on her palm.

719
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,767
Looked as though she'd
been scratching it.

720
01:11:49,838 --> 01:11:53,243
I did a scan and discovered a
piece of metal under the skin.

721
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:54,509
What was it?

722
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:57,013
Implant.

723
01:11:57,113 --> 01:12:00,317
Tracking device. Who knows?

724
01:12:00,417 --> 01:12:04,587
So the implant is why you
believed my mother's story?

725
01:12:04,687 --> 01:12:09,359
It wasn't until after I performed the
operation and I removed the fetus from her,

726
01:12:09,459 --> 01:12:13,663
that I realized your mother was
not as crazy as she sounded.

727
01:12:13,763 --> 01:12:17,364
- What was wrong with it?
- It was quite...

728
01:12:17,866 --> 01:12:19,633
disfigured.

729
01:12:21,103 --> 01:12:25,606
Deformities that I had never seen in
all my years practicing medicine.

730
01:12:28,043 --> 01:12:31,381
You see, in my line of work,
we build a healthy constitution towards

731
01:12:31,481 --> 01:12:34,782
the things that make other
people uncomfortable.

732
01:12:35,117 --> 01:12:37,184
But seeing that...

733
01:12:37,886 --> 01:12:39,453
thing...

734
01:12:42,724 --> 01:12:45,326
That is something that still
wakes me in the night.

735
01:12:50,666 --> 01:12:52,666
You're with a child.

736
01:12:54,069 --> 01:12:56,873
It is... my fiance's.

737
01:12:56,973 --> 01:13:01,309
I know what you're carrying.
And you brought that into my house.

738
01:13:01,643 --> 01:13:03,778
Please leave now.

739
01:13:09,384 --> 01:13:10,909
Fuck!

740
01:13:29,705 --> 01:13:33,040
What am I supposed to do?

741
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:23,724
Jesus, Calvin!

742
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:25,726
Where's Abby?

743
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:28,897
Abby...

744
01:14:28,997 --> 01:14:31,431
is not home.

745
01:14:32,167 --> 01:14:33,934
Where is she?

746
01:14:35,070 --> 01:14:39,406
- I was hoping you could tell me.
- I don't know. I haven't been here.

747
01:14:41,109 --> 01:14:43,443
We got into an argument.

748
01:14:44,546 --> 01:14:46,814
Just like old times?

749
01:14:49,351 --> 01:14:51,885
So, what was the fight about?

750
01:14:52,821 --> 01:14:54,922
Did she tell you about the baby?

751
01:14:56,925 --> 01:14:59,026
What about the baby?

752
01:15:01,463 --> 01:15:03,764
It's not mine.

753
01:15:14,876 --> 01:15:16,313
Yeah, that's how I felt.

754
01:15:17,113 --> 01:15:20,517
I might have taken it a little
better than you, actually.

755
01:15:20,617 --> 01:15:22,883
This can't be happening.

756
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:30,257
Becca.

757
01:15:32,894 --> 01:15:34,595
Where's the sphere?

758
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:37,231
I don't know.

759
01:15:37,933 --> 01:15:41,704
Is it with Abby? Does she have it?

760
01:15:41,804 --> 01:15:44,905
I don't know, Calvin.
I haven't been here.

761
01:15:46,675 --> 01:15:49,176
You know more than you're telling me.

762
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:54,217
I don't know where
that fucking thing is.

763
01:15:54,317 --> 01:16:00,154
Abby got rid of it. It's gone.
You'll never see it again.

764
01:16:06,695 --> 01:16:07,962
I doubt that.

765
01:16:12,434 --> 01:16:15,405
We'll see Abby and the sphere soon.

766
01:16:15,505 --> 01:16:18,171
We just have to make them come to us.

767
01:16:19,441 --> 01:16:20,508
What are you...

768
01:17:50,065 --> 01:17:53,268
<i>I warned you, Abby.
You should have listened to me.</i>

769
01:18:01,509 --> 01:18:03,744
Fuck this.

770
01:18:04,946 --> 01:18:06,513
Fuck.

771
01:18:19,795 --> 01:18:24,033
Rebecca? Just tell me where you are,
and I'll be right there.

772
01:18:24,133 --> 01:18:26,934
<i>- Rebecca can't really talk right now.</i>
- Calvin?

773
01:18:27,269 --> 01:18:28,936
Calvin?

774
01:18:30,605 --> 01:18:32,642
What the hell is going on?

775
01:18:32,742 --> 01:18:34,775
<i>I know about the baby.</i>

776
01:18:35,243 --> 01:18:38,245
<i>And I know  you have the device.</i>

777
01:18:39,014 --> 01:18:41,781
<i>I need you to bring them both to me.</i>

778
01:18:42,818 --> 01:18:45,988
- Where's Rebecca?
<i>- She's right here.</i>

779
01:18:46,088 --> 01:18:48,288
<i>Let me get her for you.</i>

780
01:18:49,257 --> 01:18:51,858
<i>Say hi to your big sister.</i>

781
01:18:53,762 --> 01:18:57,166
You son of a bitch!
What are you doing to her?

782
01:18:57,266 --> 01:19:00,801
<i>If you don't bring what
they want up to this cabin,</i>

783
01:19:01,503 --> 01:19:03,503
<i>I'm gonna kill her.</i>

784
01:19:04,272 --> 01:19:06,173
You wouldn't.

785
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:11,778
<i>You have no idea what
I'm going through,</i>

786
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,916
<i>or what I would do to make it stop.</i>

787
01:19:15,016 --> 01:19:18,721
Okay. I'll leave right now.

788
01:19:18,821 --> 01:19:20,587
Good Girl.

789
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:24,344
Abby,

790
01:19:25,610 --> 01:19:27,166
don't call the cops.

791
01:19:28,530 --> 01:19:30,297
They'll know.

792
01:19:59,227 --> 01:20:00,694
She's on her way.

793
01:20:08,503 --> 01:20:11,071
You know, this isn't what I wanted.

794
01:20:13,942 --> 01:20:16,810
I love Abby.

795
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:20,644
<i>I was...</i>

796
01:20:21,155 --> 01:20:23,696
<i>so excited when she told me the news...</i>

797
01:20:24,219 --> 01:20:26,753
about the baby.

798
01:20:29,524 --> 01:20:32,092
But now it looks like the joke's on me.

799
01:20:48,209 --> 01:20:50,444
I've seen things.

800
01:20:51,746 --> 01:20:53,413
You,

801
01:20:54,749 --> 01:20:56,516
Chuck.

802
01:20:57,953 --> 01:21:02,589
I know what you've been through.
And I've seen pieces.

803
01:21:03,725 --> 01:21:06,293
I don't want to see anymore.

804
01:21:11,633 --> 01:21:14,434
I don't know how you made
it through all these years.

805
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:20,407
But they'll come back.

806
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:23,757
For the device.

807
01:21:25,747 --> 01:21:27,329
For Abby.

808
01:21:29,918 --> 01:21:32,919
Getting you back will just be a bonus.

809
01:21:34,255 --> 01:21:38,261
Maybe then... they'll leave me alone.

810
01:21:38,361 --> 01:21:41,795
Get out of my head!

811
01:21:53,341 --> 01:21:55,710
Oh, my God! Rebecca, I'm so...

812
01:21:59,381 --> 01:22:01,348
That's a good girl, Abby.

813
01:22:11,392 --> 01:22:14,995
- Calvin, what the fuck are you doing?
- It's what I have to do.

814
01:22:24,973 --> 01:22:27,074
We shouldn't have to wait long.

815
01:22:28,209 --> 01:22:31,478
- For what?
- They're coming now.

816
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:36,015
- They'll take what's theirs.
- And then what?

817
01:22:36,851 --> 01:22:38,885
Calvin,

818
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:41,655
you love me.

819
01:22:42,557 --> 01:22:44,324
Is this what you want?

820
01:22:45,093 --> 01:22:47,763
I wanted a family with you.

821
01:22:47,863 --> 01:22:50,530
Our family.

822
01:22:51,332 --> 01:22:54,067
Calvin, it's your baby.

823
01:22:54,903 --> 01:22:55,769
No.

824
01:22:58,573 --> 01:23:01,441
How did you find out you were sterile?

825
01:23:04,446 --> 01:23:06,013
The doctor...

826
01:23:07,549 --> 01:23:09,223
called.

827
01:23:11,553 --> 01:23:14,254
Did he really call?

828
01:23:17,358 --> 01:23:19,659
I don't remember.

829
01:23:20,595 --> 01:23:21,831
I think so...

830
01:23:22,031 --> 01:23:25,332
How would they know
you were sterile, Calvin?

831
01:23:26,734 --> 01:23:28,702
It's yours.

832
01:23:31,306 --> 01:23:34,643
You want to get rid of it,
is that what you want?

833
01:23:34,743 --> 01:23:39,515
It's not about what I
want anymore. I need...

834
01:23:39,615 --> 01:23:43,784
The voices, the pictures, in my mind...

835
01:23:44,052 --> 01:23:48,791
to stop. There's only one
way that happens and I...

836
01:23:49,391 --> 01:23:53,793
I can't control it.
I'm sorry. But it's true.

837
01:23:54,262 --> 01:23:56,096
Calvin.

838
01:23:57,398 --> 01:23:59,466
Please.

839
01:23:59,968 --> 01:24:01,735
Let's go home.

840
01:24:03,071 --> 01:24:05,038
Let's go home.

841
01:24:08,076 --> 01:24:10,711
Don't you fucking
touch me, I'll kill you.

842
01:24:13,948 --> 01:24:15,615
I'm so sorry.

843
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:27,461
No!

844
01:24:37,805 --> 01:24:39,472
Oh, God.

845
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:45,179
Where are you? Where?

846
01:24:49,350 --> 01:24:51,685
No, no, no.

847
01:25:00,028 --> 01:25:02,028
You're here.

848
01:25:04,499 --> 01:25:06,304
You found it.

849
01:25:08,469 --> 01:25:10,637
I brought it for you.

850
01:25:10,972 --> 01:25:12,939
I brought them.

851
01:25:41,169 --> 01:25:42,471
In case he comes back.

852
01:25:42,771 --> 01:25:45,608
Did you hear those screams?
He's not coming back.

853
01:25:45,708 --> 01:25:48,307
Well then it's for his friends.

854
01:25:48,910 --> 01:25:50,746
I don't think that'll work.

855
01:25:50,846 --> 01:25:54,450
Do you have any other suggestions?
Because I feel a lot safer going with a gun.

856
01:25:54,550 --> 01:25:56,285
I don't think we can stop them.

857
01:25:56,385 --> 01:26:00,754
There has to be some way.
How come they didn't find me after I left?

858
01:26:21,876 --> 01:26:23,043
God!

859
01:26:24,912 --> 01:26:25,913
Oh, shit.

860
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:40,094
I think they're already here.

861
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:47,768
Not this time, you fuckers.

862
01:26:52,173 --> 01:26:54,541
You didn't load it?

863
01:26:55,777 --> 01:26:58,111
Oh, we gotta go get the shells.

864
01:27:47,362 --> 01:27:51,364
Your baby is healthy, Ms. Powell.
Would you like to see him?

865
01:27:51,799 --> 01:27:52,966
Yes.

866
01:28:06,381 --> 01:28:10,485
Why is he so quiet?
Why isn't he crying?

867
01:28:10,786 --> 01:28:13,486
He doesn't cry, Ms. Powell.
