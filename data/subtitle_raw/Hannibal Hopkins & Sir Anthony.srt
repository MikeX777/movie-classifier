1
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:31,831
- I like to be center stage

2
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:34,667
taking the big parts.

3
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:38,505
I'm not interested
in being worthy,

4
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,774
I'm not interested
in being virtuous

5
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:43,610
and standing there for
the good of the company.

6
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:45,545
I'm simply not
interested in that.

7
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:47,147
It's the way I'm constructed.

8
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,283
It's my own megalomaniacal
selfishness, I suppose.

9
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:52,452
I'm not interested in
all that experimentation,

10
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:56,322
and we've all got a knuckle
under and obey the director.

11
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:57,457
I say, bollocks.

12
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:01,461
- In 1991, in
The Silence of the Lambs

13
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:02,662
by Jonathan Demme,

14
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:05,732
Anthony Hopkins achieves
worldwide success,

15
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:09,803
playing a cannibalistic
psychopath imprisoned in a cage.

16
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:14,574
The most famous serial killer
of all time, Hannibal Lecter.

17
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:15,842
Even though he was on screen

18
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,911
for only 20 minutes
throughout the movie,

19
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:20,613
it's enough to propel him
to the top of Hollywood

20
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:22,449
at almost 60 years old,

21
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,617
and after more than
30 years of acting.

22
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,587
The biggest directors
fight over him,

23
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,191
like Francis Ford Coppola
who casts him in Dracula.

24
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:32,425
- Action!

25
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:36,162
- Mina!

26
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:39,265
- The thing is going
to happen pretty fast.

27
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,500
- Yes.
- You confront them,

28
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:41,801
they attack you,

29
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:43,336
Van Helsing challenges you,

30
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:46,239
you make your lay statement
and then you leave.

31
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,841
- Even Steven
Spielberg wants him

32
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:51,177
to play the president of the
United States in Amistad.

33
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:52,445
- Yeah.

34
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,613
- And you're coming down
with your secretary.

35
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:54,881
This was something,
you can trial this.

36
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:56,549
But this is a better location.

37
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:57,851
- Good.
- So we'll do that first.

38
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:58,518
- And have you seen the
house of the General?

39
00:01:58,551 --> 00:01:59,853
- No.

40
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:01,387
- Come here, because
you're going to love this.

41
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,923
- 1992 is a
turning point for him.

42
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:07,360
In addition to becoming the
favorite actor of James Ivory,

43
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:09,429
it's also the year
that he is cemented

44
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,464
among the greatest
actors of all time

45
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:14,601
for his iconic role in
The Silence of the Lambs.

46
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:18,671
- And the Oscar goes
to Anthony Hopkins

47
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:20,540
in The Silence of The Lambs.

48
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,576
- I sat there that
evening in the Oscars

49
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,947
and Ted Tally picked up
the best screenplay writer.

50
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:31,584
And at that moment I thought,
"I think I've got the Oscar,"

51
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:35,421
and Kathy Bates came
on stage to present it

52
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:37,657
and I knew she was
going to call my name.

53
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:41,961
First of all, before I say on,

54
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,664
I want to say
hello to my mother.

55
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:46,866
She's in Wales watching
this on television

56
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,770
with Eve and Jean
and Jill and Tony.

57
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:52,906
My father died 11
years ago tonight,

58
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:55,775
so maybe he had something to
do with this as well.

59
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:58,244
And then I thought when I got
up there to take the Oscar,

60
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:00,313
I thought, "Well now I
can do some bad films,"

61
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,781
which I proceeded to do.

62
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:02,916
Doesn't matter really.

63
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,953
I touched the ceiling
of my life, I suppose.

64
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:10,823
I love the coldness of life.

65
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,993
I love the
inevitability of it all.

66
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:24,671
I had no friends, because I
rejected friends, I suppose.

67
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,005
So I was lonely.

68
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,707
I was a non-starter.

69
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:30,276
Very poor student.

70
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,513
I was convinced I was
on the wrong planet.

71
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,452
I think that those years
were quite formative for me.

72
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:41,788
I was escaping, I
think, from my sense

73
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,856
of being a kind of clodhopper.

74
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:49,696
Well, I was the source of worry.

75
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,997
I was the only child and
I was the source of worry

76
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,599
of both my parents
when I was a kid,

77
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,701
because I was so
stupid at school.

78
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,669
I mean, I haven't got
fashionable high flowing words

79
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:57,637
like, I was dyslexic,

80
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,838
I think I was just stupid.

81
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:01,774
And I couldn't figure out
what anyone was talking about.

82
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,410
And I was the lonely kid
at the top of the streets

83
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:05,712
staring at my thumbnail,

84
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,380
and all the other kids were down

85
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,548
the other end of the street.

86
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,816
My father used to
say to my mother,

87
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,551
"There's something very
wrong with this boy."

88
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:15,021
Which is not the way to
give one self-confidence,

89
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:17,357
but they were worried about me.

90
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,859
But in a strange way, I
had an idyllic childhood.

91
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,828
I remember the first
four years very clearly.

92
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,963
I've got one of those,
cursed and blessed

93
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:29,369
with images and a
very long memory.

94
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,438
I can remember back
to very early times,

95
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:35,475
probably about the age of
two, something like that.

96
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:38,978
And I remember South Wales.

97
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,880
I was born in the rural
part of Port Talbot,

98
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:42,749
a place called Margam.

99
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,818
And it really was like
the Garden of Eden.

100
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,553
I remember our
little front garden,

101
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:48,521
and it was really...

102
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:50,356
a couple of small trees there,

103
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,126
and it really was
like a mini paradise.

104
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:56,029
And I can recall,
when I close my eyes,

105
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:59,432
I can go back there and it's
all changed now, of course,

106
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:04,637
but I can, the smells
and the colors.

107
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:06,906
But when I went to school,

108
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,875
that was the beginning of
the turning point for me.

109
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,576
When I realized I was different,

110
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,047
backward, more slow.

111
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,615
And I have no regret at all,

112
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,550
because that was the
fire in the belly

113
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,053
that gave me enough
anger and rage.

114
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:29,362
My father was a pretty
boisterous, tough
old sort, really.

115
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:31,164
He was a remarkable man.

116
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:32,532
I loved him very much.

117
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:35,601
He was a baker by profession.

118
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:36,903
That's what he started.

119
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:40,073
And he took over, he was
a baker with his father.

120
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,140
Good God.

121
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,444
Believe it or not
I lived in here.

122
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,414
It's just like in my dreams.

123
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:49,782
Ruins.

124
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,752
Maybe it's a symbol
of my own ruined life.

125
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:53,820
I don't know.

126
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:57,156
And I remember that sometimes,

127
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,125
the yellow look in his
face around the gills,

128
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:00,693
and the sweat.

129
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:04,063
And he'd say, "Oh God."

130
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,999
And he'd do that, and I remember
that God, he's worked hard.

131
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:13,005
Yeah, I think that's why
I get angry sometimes.

132
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:15,975
- Do you think of
your father often now?

133
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:16,943
- All the time.

134
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:18,177
- Yes.

135
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:18,745
- And as I get older,
he's becoming me.

136
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:19,879
I'm him.

137
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,515
I remember I used to
play the piano a lot.

138
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,750
I was a little
artist, you could say.

139
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:24,951
I used to play Beethoven
and all that stuff,

140
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:26,152
and Chopin, and all that.

141
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:27,854
And he was a baker,

142
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,189
and he used to ask me to come
and help him in the shop.

143
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,892
Carry the cakes into the
shop during school holidays.

144
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:35,528
Well I'd sort of get distracted.

145
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,063
And I remember sitting
at the top of the house

146
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:38,030
where this piano was,

147
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,031
and I remember him coming out,

148
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,733
and "For God sakes," he'd say,

149
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,535
"I asked you to take those
donuts into the shop."

150
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,803
"What the hell are
you doing up here?"

151
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:45,004
I was playing the piano.

152
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:46,139
"So what's that you're playing?"

153
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:47,607
I remember him
standing in the doorway

154
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,509
and he had flour dust
in the hair on his arms.

155
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:50,777
Really hard worker.

156
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,644
He said, "What are you playing?"

157
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:52,979
I said, "Beethoven."

158
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:55,014
He said, "No wonder you
went deaf."

159
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,686
I don't know what my
role in the world is.

160
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:03,022
I came out here many years ago

161
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:05,925
because I wanted to be
in movies, be an actor.

162
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,894
I was a bad boy.

163
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,564
I couldn't stand
the British theater.

164
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:12,799
I couldn't stand any of it,

165
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:15,067
because I didn't feel
I belonged there.

166
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,769
Nobody's fault.

167
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:20,807
I just didn't have it in my
nature to be part of that group.

168
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,642
So I reinvented my life,

169
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:24,210
and I came out here
some years ago,

170
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:25,545
and you see the result of it.

171
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:28,147
I'm pretty feisty.

172
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,082
I am rebellious and happy.

173
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:35,521
And so I want to
give back to people.

174
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:37,557
Not because I'm on a
crusade, far from it.

175
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,692
I just do this because I've
got nothing better to do.

176
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:41,627
They give me a cup of coffee
and some fruit in the morning.

177
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:42,995
So it keeps me off the streets,

178
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,130
keeps me out of trouble,

179
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:45,264
and I get some fun doing it.

180
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,933
These pretty
beautiful girls here.

181
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,134
Women, women.

182
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,169
- They're beautiful.

183
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,170
I get hugs from them all.

184
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:52,638
It's very nice.

185
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,841
- Some of the men
hug me as well.

186
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:56,676
But it's lovely to
see them opening up,

187
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:59,078
and if that's their response,
then that makes me happy.

188
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:05,551
- In 1965,
after five years on stage

189
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,220
in Cardiff and then in London,

190
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:10,056
he is noticed by the legendary
playwright and actor,

191
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:11,290
Sir Laurence Olivier,

192
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,894
who invites him to join him
in the Royal National Theatre.

193
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:20,333
Hopkins becomes his understudy
and eventually replaces him.

194
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:23,002
In his memoir, Laurence
Olivier writes,

195
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:26,339
"An exceptionally promising
young actor from the company,

196
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:30,276
named Anthony Hopkins,
replaced me and played my role

197
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:33,579
as a cat with a mouse
between its teeth."

198
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:38,317
- Yeah, when I started out
I just wanted to be famous.

199
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,919
I didn't want to
become a great actor.

200
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:41,721
I didn't want to become a
great Shakespearean actor.

201
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,055
I had no idea.

202
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,290
When people would say,
"You're the next Olivier."

203
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:45,725
I didn't want to become
the next Olivier.

204
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:47,093
I didn't want to stand
in wrinkled tights

205
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:49,028
on The Old Vic stage
for the rest of my life.

206
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:51,764
I had ideas beyond that.

207
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:02,008
I was discontent, I
was angry and fed up.

208
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,878
And I hated being part
of an establishment

209
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:08,180
and hated doing Shakespeare.

210
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,882
It was all my own making.

211
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,017
I was the enemy
within, you know?

212
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,018
It was all my own making.

213
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,286
It was nobody else's fault.

214
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:17,924
Everyone did their best
to cater to my needs.

215
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,327
- Were you
drinking at that time?

216
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,897
- Oh yes, but all actors drink.

217
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,732
That was just an
episode in my life,

218
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:27,867
that's over and done with now.

219
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,869
That's a boring episode of life.

220
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,704
But I don't think it helped,

221
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:32,972
but I was restless.

222
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:34,840
I wanted to get out,
and I was frightened.

223
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:38,177
I was afraid I was taking
on this monumental part,

224
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,146
and I never pretended
that I had the courage

225
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,281
to do these great parts
like Macbeth and King Lear.

226
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:44,817
I never said I could do them.

227
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,253
I never thought I had
the courage to do them.

228
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:54,760
I wanted it all.

229
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:55,895
I wanted to be successful,

230
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:56,862
and I wanted to be famous,

231
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,364
and I wanted to be in movies.

232
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:01,167
And I wanted to meet people
like Katharine Hepburn,

233
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,735
and I want to meet
Peter O'Toole,

234
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:03,836
and I met Peter O'Toole,

235
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,404
and I've met some great people,

236
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,007
some wonderful directors,
some wonderful actors.

237
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,810
Would you say, Father, that
I have the makings of a king?

238
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:12,712
- Splendid king.

239
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:15,247
- Would you expect me, Father,
to give up without a fight?

240
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,349
- Of course you'll fight.

241
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,184
I raised you to.

242
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:19,452
- I don't care what
you offer Phillip,

243
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:20,987
I don't care what
plans you make,

244
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,856
I'll have the Aquitaine
and Alais and the crown,

245
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:26,125
I'll not give up one
to get the other.

246
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:27,860
I won't trade off
Alais or Aquitaine

247
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,261
to that walking pustule!

248
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,265
No, your loving son will not.

249
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,705
I remember the first few days
on the set of Lion in Winter,

250
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:43,275
and I'd done a movie
test with Peter O'Toole

251
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,944
a few weeks before.

252
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:48,047
And he was on the test with me

253
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,982
reading off lines
off the camera,

254
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,753
And I remember
them saying, "Cut!"

255
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:57,289
And O'Toole saying,
"You've got it. Fantastic."

256
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,761
Bloody marvelous darling.

257
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:02,895
I'm a big star.

258
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,866
"Let's go and have a drink."

259
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,968
See, I love those
guys, the drinkers,

260
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,403
because they were the best.

261
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:12,772
I love them, I love drunks.

262
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:13,773
I love that.

263
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:15,274
And Peter's a great boozer.

264
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:16,809
I had to give it up

265
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:17,977
because it nearly damn
killed me in the end.

266
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,478
But I remember that sensation

267
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,447
of, "Oh yeah, that'd
be marvelous."

268
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:24,950
But you have to have a
certain vulnerability

269
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,820
and to be a certain
amount of mess inside you.

270
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,955
I think to really succeed, you
have to be really screwed up

271
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:32,425
to be successful
in this business.

272
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,327
- What did you
learn from Katharine Hepburn?

273
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,164
What did you learn from
Hepburn in that movie?

274
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,465
- She said to me, she said,

275
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:43,369
"Don't act, don't act,
just speak the lines.

276
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:45,171
Be what you are."

277
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,305
I was playing Richard
the Lionheart.

278
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:47,873
She knew.

279
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,175
She said, "You look good.
You've got a good head.

280
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,443
You've got a good
shoulders on you."

281
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:51,811
She said, "You've got
all the advantages,

282
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:54,213
so don't act, don't overact."

283
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:56,082
She said, "Don't be theatrical."

284
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:57,049
I said, "Well what do I do?"

285
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,818
She said, "Speak the lines."

286
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:02,188
Which sounds very simplistic,
but I think she was right.

287
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:05,958
She's talking about filmmaking.

288
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:07,126
Don't overact.

289
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,961
Don't show too much.

290
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:12,832
We could tangle spiders
on the webs you weave.

291
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:15,534
- If I'm so devious,
why don't you go?

292
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,937
Don't stand there
quivering in limbo.

293
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:22,041
Love me, little
lamb, or leave me.

294
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,843
- You were influenced
by the movies,

295
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:25,244
weren't you, the actors?

296
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:26,579
We all were.

297
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:28,180
- I was brought up on movies.

298
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:30,316
I have a nice, my parents
were quite disciplined.

299
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:32,451
I used to go to a movie once
a week, or twice a week,

300
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:33,919
but I used to watch

301
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:36,188
all those old Warner
Brothers movies,

302
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,523
Bogart and all that lot.

303
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:38,991
- Yeah, yeah.

304
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,426
- And I used to
learn the script.

305
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:42,762
- You could?

306
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:43,996
- I knew you were
going to ask me this.

307
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:44,964
You want me to do one?

308
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:46,465
- Speak the script, yeah.

309
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:47,366
- Well, okay.

310
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:49,368
- But you remember
those scripts?

311
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:51,003
- Yes.

312
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:53,005
My name is Spade, Sam Spade.

313
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:55,341
License number 357896,

314
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:58,077
issued by the police
department of San Francisco.

315
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,411
Occupation private detective,

316
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,247
sometimes known as private eye.

317
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:03,883
- Well done!

318
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:09,121
- That's Bogart.

319
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,293
- As close to Lauren
Bacall as I've ever heard.

320
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:17,329
Very nice.

321
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:18,364
It's just another facet of your-

322
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:20,032
- Yeah, very slick
going up for life.

323
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:21,233
I'll tell you about it.

324
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:22,434
So it's not bad is it?

325
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,602
- Yeah, it's good, and you
remember the lines definitely.

326
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,070
- Yes, I remember the lines

327
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:26,071
I learned all that
before I came on here.

328
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:27,940
I knew you were going to ask me.

329
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:30,643
- For God's sake, don't let
them know all the secrets.

330
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:31,977
- I wasn't born here.

331
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:32,978
- Yeah

332
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:37,082
- At age 37,
Anthony Hopkins decides

333
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:40,519
to leave England and try
his luck in Hollywood.

334
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,955
He starts another
chapter of his life,

335
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,157
following the example
of Humphrey Bogart,

336
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:47,293
James Cagney, and Marlon Brando.

337
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:52,298
This chapter is undoubtedly
the most intense.

338
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,633
Anthony Hopkins, still
grapples with a demon

339
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,303
that will not let go, alcohol.

340
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:04,176
His lack of self-confidence
and his discomfort,

341
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,946
as he often says,
encourages his drinking.

342
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,950
Hollywood would be his hell,

343
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:14,186
and then later, his redemption.

344
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,233
- Well, I found tequila
when I came here

345
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:30,336
and I drunk enough of
that to unzip my brain

346
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,670
and drive me crazy,

347
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,006
and then I woke up
and came to my senses.

348
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,041
I thought, "Well, I'm
going to blow it all

349
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,077
if I don't stop
doing this nonsense."

350
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,079
I was trouble, I know.

351
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:41,647
I was just a bore really.

352
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,950
And I couldn't fit in, and
I just didn't feel at home.

353
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:46,051
And that was my problem.

354
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,723
I'm just bad tempered,
trying too much and all that.

355
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:53,192
And it all came to
a bit of a crisis,

356
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,426
and I walked out.

357
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,294
I left in the middle
of a production,

358
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:58,097
which was a very
drastic thing to do.

359
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:00,232
I hurt a few people,

360
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:08,040
but it's the only way
I knew how to survive

361
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,008
whatever I was going through.

362
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,476
And so I got out.

363
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:14,513
And I was in work, I started
work fairly soon after that.

364
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:16,749
I suppose I went through a
sort of, not a breakdown,

365
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:20,753
but I just felt very
unhappy and unsettled,

366
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:24,757
and I had no sense of
self-confidence at all.

367
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,593
It's not I fear death
or the end of it all,

368
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,028
but I am aware of it.

369
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:30,596
I'm 57 years of age,

370
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:34,166
and I want to have the richest
years of my life ahead of me.

371
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,502
And I plan to, and I'm going to.

372
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:46,645
When I first came to California,
out here in Santa Monica,

373
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:51,717
it was like being
on another planet.

374
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:56,155
I thought they were
different race of people.

375
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:58,123
Everyone in those days
looked very glamorous,

376
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:01,627
and I thought they were
all tall blonde girls

377
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,663
and good looking guys.

378
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,601
I like the shallowness
of it all in a way.

379
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:13,238
Jonathan Miller said to
me when he came out here,

380
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,740
He said, "How can you live here?

381
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:16,675
It's like living on the moon."

382
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:19,078
I said, "Well, it's all right.

383
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:19,778
I like it here."

384
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:23,415
There's a lovely time in
the evening, like now,

385
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:27,419
when it feels very,
very peaceful and
it just feels right.

386
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:30,456
I carry that feeling
around with me

387
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,725
most of my time now,

388
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:36,228
It's that thing where it just
feels right inside, you know?

389
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:40,032
No contention, no argument,

390
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:44,136
no fighting, no belligerence.

391
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:49,842
- For him, California
becomes another planet,

392
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:53,345
one on which he lives with his
second wife, Jennifer Lynton,

393
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,447
who he met in England
while she was working

394
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:57,182
as a production assistant.

395
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:03,422
There, Anthony Hopkins left
his first wife Petronella,

396
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:06,558
and the child they had
together, his daughter, Abigail.

397
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:12,731
America for Hopkins is the
world of possibilities.

398
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:16,335
Luck smiles on him, when in
'78, Richard Attenborough

399
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,637
offers him a key
role in his career,

400
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:22,541
as a mad ventriloquist in
the little known film, Magic.

401
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:24,376
- You ruined the rising aces.

402
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,211
- So what, screw it.

403
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,480
You see the broad
with the big jugs?

404
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,182
- You mean the young
lady in the feathers?

405
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,884
Yeah I see her, so what?

406
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:34,553
- Wonder if she'd like a
roll in the shavings with me?

407
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:37,790
- I don't think
you're very funny.

408
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,191
- Well they do.

409
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:43,228
- What about the vent
though, first of all,

410
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,464
how difficult is it to
throw your voice like that

411
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:47,332
without moving your
lips as they say?

412
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:52,538
- Well I found it fairly easy,
maybe because I'm an actor

413
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,774
and you have to keep
your voice flexible,

414
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:57,743
and I was willing to learn.

415
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:00,279
And I decided that the
only way I could do it

416
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,748
was to enjoy it.

417
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,550
And I've been a mimic as well,

418
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:09,588
so I found it fairly easy,
and I had a good teacher.

419
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:10,823
Now, maybe I was a good student.

420
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,291
- Can you still do it?

421
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:13,659
- Yes

422
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:14,526
- Like what?

423
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,761
- Yes I can,

424
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:16,595
Hi, Michael.

425
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:17,362
How are you doing?

426
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:18,230
Good to see you.

427
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,898
Hi gang, you okay?

428
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,200
Fantastic.

429
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,208
- Hey you know what I think?

430
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:31,276
- No, what do you think?

431
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,245
- We're going to be a star!

432
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:41,753
- I find that acting has been

433
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,455
tremendously therapeutic for me.

434
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:44,957
So I think if I
hadn't been an actor,

435
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,226
I probably would have been,

436
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:48,494
I don't know if I'd have
been slightly criminal,

437
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:51,463
but I don't think I would have
been a very nice human being.

438
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:52,798
I don't think I would have,

439
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:55,467
I think I would have
eaten myself alive,

440
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,669
and acting has saved
me from that in a way.

441
00:18:57,703 --> 00:19:02,875
It's helped me to touch
parts of my own personality,

442
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:09,248
I suppose, of my
own inner darkness.

443
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,584
- Darkness,
monsters, prejudice,

444
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:14,419
violence, humanity,

445
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,622
in 1980 with the film,
The Elephant Man,

446
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,490
in his role as Doctor Treves,

447
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:20,559
who tries to come to
the aid of John Hurt,

448
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:22,427
the famous man-elephant.

449
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:25,831
Anthony Hopkins puts on
his Hollywood star clothes.

450
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:28,600
On set, the relationship
between David Lynch

451
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:31,603
and Hopkins is
appalling, but it works.

452
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,405
The film is a masterpiece,

453
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:37,676
and will forever remain
one of his greatest roles.

454
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:40,379
- Basically, it's a
very touching story

455
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,448
about a man called John Merrick,

456
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,250
who was so seriously deformed.

457
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:47,586
I don't know what the
nature of his disease was,

458
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:48,887
but he had a very large head,

459
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,990
and the one side of his
body totally deformed.

460
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,793
And he was a sideshow freak.

461
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:57,996
And he was cruelly beaten
and treated very badly.

462
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,298
He was born like this.

463
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:20,385
- And the part I play
is Dr. Frederick Treves.

464
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,456
And Treves found him in the
circus, in the sideshow,

465
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:28,327
and took him back to the London
hospital and kept him there.

466
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,937
But John Merrick could speak,

467
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,939
and he could read,
and he could write,

468
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:44,476
and he became a centerpiece
for society in London.

469
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:45,544
This is about the 1880s.

470
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:50,616
- Mr. Merrick, I'd like
you to meet my wife, Anne.

471
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:53,051
Anne, this is John Merrick.

472
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:59,758
- I'm very pleased to
meet you, Mr. Merrick.

473
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:03,996
- I...

474
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:04,896
I...

475
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:07,532
I very...

476
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,873
- It's when Jonathan Demme
sees David Lynch's film,

477
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:16,975
that he considers
Anthony Hopkins for

478
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:19,411
The Silence of the Lambs.

479
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,647
This is the role
of a serial killer,

480
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,383
a machiavellian cannibal.

481
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,551
No one has heard of the
script in Hollywood,

482
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:29,988
but Hopkins quickly realizes
the potential of such a role

483
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:32,624
and starts shaping
the character.

484
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:36,428
Slicked black hair, glassy
eyes, and a straight jacket.

485
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,430
The mask is made for him.

486
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:41,800
- I didn't want
to play the evils,

487
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,935
because if you're
playing a madman,

488
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,638
if you play the
madness, it's ludicrous.

489
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,473
How do you play madness?

490
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:53,578
So I opted for playing the
really super sane side of him,

491
00:21:55,981 --> 00:22:00,652
the highly civilized
section of Hannibal's mind.

492
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:03,088
And then all the
evil that he is,

493
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:06,091
is there for the audience to
make up for their own minds.

494
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,493
Good evening, Clarice.

495
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:13,498
- I thought you might like
your drawings back, doctor.

496
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:17,803
Just until you get your view.

497
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,672
- How very thoughtful.

498
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,110
Or did Jack Crawford send
you for one last wheedle

499
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:27,846
before you're both
booted off the case?

500
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:29,614
- No, I came
because I wanted to.

501
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,622
- People will say we're in love.

502
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:39,758
- Let me talk about some
of the specifics of that,

503
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:43,028
well there's the noise you
make, that .

504
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:43,895
- Oh yeah.

505
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:44,996
- Yeah.

506
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,732
Now that presumably
wasn't written,

507
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:47,966
that must've come from
you, I would have thought,

508
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:50,435
or was that Jonathan
Demme's idea?

509
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:51,603
- That happened on the
spur of the moment.

510
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:53,171
I just put it in for a joke.

511
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,742
Because you heard
Jonathan Demme laugh,

512
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:59,778
quietly so he didn't
destroy the soundtrack.

513
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:03,648
And I just did it,
it just came to me.

514
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:06,017
And I heard him say,
"God," in the corner,

515
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,452
he was watching the camera,

516
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,054
he was on the monitor,
watching the film.

517
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:11,957
And he said, "Cut."

518
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,025
He says, "You are
so sick, Hopkins."

519
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,494
I said, "Was it over the top?"

520
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:16,962
He said, "Yeah," he
said, "But I like it."

521
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:18,497
So we kept it in.

522
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,801
- It's
with his hissing noise

523
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:24,770
that Anthony Hopkins
chills the blood

524
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:26,838
of an entire generation,

525
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:30,776
and earns his stripes as
Hollywood's greatest psychopath.

526
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,244
- Five, five, nine.

527
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:34,679
- The first to pay
the price is Jodie Foster,

528
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:38,750
who still remembers it in 2016
on The Graham Norton Show.

529
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:42,654
- Is it true, did you never
speak to Anthony Hopkins?

530
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:43,622
- Nope.

531
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:44,656
Never spoke to him.

532
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:45,824
He was scary.

533
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:48,193
The first day we had a reading,

534
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:50,095
we had like a
little read-through.

535
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:52,597
I got there early, and then
I went to the bathroom,

536
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:54,032
and I came back, everybody
was sitting down.

537
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:56,234
We did the read-through
of the film,

538
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,637
and by the end of it, I never
wanted to talk to him again.

539
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,138
I was petrified.

540
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:02,808
- But you never passed
backstage in a corridor?

541
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:03,809
- No, I avoided him.

542
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:07,712
I really avoided him.

543
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:10,215
And then I was eating
a tuna fish sandwich.

544
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:13,084
It was the last day, and
he came up to me, and he...

545
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,820
I guess he was sidled up to me.

546
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:16,955
And I said, I don't know, I
sort of had a tear in my eye.

547
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:18,523
I was like, "I was
really scared of you."

548
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:20,192
And he said, "I
was scared of you!"

549
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,228
- May I ask your credentials?

550
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:24,162
- And
by the time that we got

551
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:25,764
into our scenes together,

552
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,866
he was behind this
glass partition

553
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:30,602
and he had to be unscrewed
out of the glass partition

554
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,103
in order for us to communicate.

555
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,138
- Closer please.

556
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,008
Closer.

557
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,254
- There were a few
things that he added in

558
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:51,623
that for some reason, just
sent shivers up my spine.

559
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:56,328
There's one moment where
Lecter is going on at Clarice,

560
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:57,762
and saying, "You're
just a rube,"

561
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:00,098
and, "You're some
small-town hick."

562
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:06,071
And he started
mimicking my accent,

563
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:10,041
and that just really upset me.

564
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:13,211
I guess as an actor,
I got really...

565
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:16,214
it really took me off guard,

566
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:17,749
to have the actor
who's playing opposite

567
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:20,051
of you start
mimicking the accent

568
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:21,319
that you're using as an actor.

569
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:24,356
And he got to me.

570
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:27,225
And I think it really
shows on screen actually.

571
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,660
- You know what you
look like to me,

572
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:31,096
with your good bag
and your cheap shoes?

573
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:32,297
You look like a rube.

574
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:37,202
A well-scrubbed, hustling
rube with a little taste.

575
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:40,639
Good nutrition's given
you some length of bone,

576
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:42,274
but you're not more
than one generation

577
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:45,977
from poor white trash,
are you, Agent Starling?

578
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:48,914
And that accent you've tried
so desperately to shed,

579
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:51,049
pure West Virginia.

580
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:52,017
What is your father, dear?

581
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,652
Is he a coal miner?

582
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:55,787
Does he stink of the land?

583
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,223
And oh, how quickly
the boys found you.

584
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:00,158
All those tedious,
sticky fumblings

585
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:02,193
in the back seats of cars,

586
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,229
while you could only
dream of getting out,

587
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:05,196
getting anywhere,

588
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,832
getting all the way to the FBI.

589
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,636
I understand monsters.

590
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:12,871
I understand tyrants.

591
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,239
I understand madmen.

592
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:16,041
I don't know what it is,

593
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,009
I have a sympathy with
them, in a strange way.

594
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:21,046
I can understand what
makes people tick

595
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,714
in these darker levels.

596
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,688
- Jesus Christ!

597
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:32,290
- Ow, ow, ow.

598
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,818
- Hello.

599
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:03,288
So here we are at the
Universal Studios.

600
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,960
This is Dino De
Laurentiis' production.

601
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:12,330
So we're going into
the original set

602
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:13,431
that we have on
Silence of the Lambs.

603
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,700
Where it's re-built.

604
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:16,401
Hello.

605
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:21,072
So this is the return
to the original set,

606
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:26,011
the jail where they
lock Dr. Lecter up.

607
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,380
It's funny being back here.

608
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:31,016
We started filming
here last week,

609
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:36,221
and this is the corridor that
Jodie Foster walked down.

610
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:42,027
So here we are back
like old times.

611
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,462
I can't take any of
this too seriously.

612
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,464
I can't take it
seriously at all.

613
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,799
Anyway, it's fun.

614
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:48,833
It's all a game.

615
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:49,901
And these are the cells.

616
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:53,004
And this is where...

617
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:03,481
This was Lecter's cell.

618
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:07,786
So it is odd, to say the least,

619
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:08,820
to be back here.

620
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:17,796
- March 30th,
1992 is Oscar night.

621
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:20,432
Sometime earlier,
the film's director,

622
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:22,367
Jonathan Demme told reporters,

623
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,969
"We created Hollywood's
greatest villain

624
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:26,938
since Norman Bates in Psycho."

625
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,542
So when MC Billy
Crystal enters the stage

626
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:32,777
wearing the Hannibal
Lecter mask,

627
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:35,213
Hopkins realizes that
whatever the verdict,

628
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:38,516
his interpretation
of a fearsomely
intelligent psychopath

629
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,784
is now legendary,

630
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:43,154
and that it has propelled him
to the ranks of the greatest.

631
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:47,092
- His competitors
in the best actor category

632
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:49,260
are Warren Beatty,
Robert De Niro,

633
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:51,362
Nick Nolte, and Robin Williams.

634
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:04,275
Hopkins would later say that
the evening was life changing,

635
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:06,111
and that he finally
felt legitimate

636
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:09,380
and accepted in this world
that was not meant for him.

637
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:16,988
- I'm having some of the
academy over for dinner.

638
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:18,356
Care to join me?

639
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:21,292
- Yes, anytime.

640
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:22,427
- Anytime.

641
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:24,896
Good evening.

642
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,500
- Welcome, live at the
St. James's Club LA,

643
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:31,169
cuddly cannibal,
Anthony Hopkins.

644
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:41,946
- Anthony, welcome
and congratulations.

645
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,515
- Thank you, Terry.

646
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:45,517
- Well, one of the reasons
that I'm interviewing you

647
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:50,321
so far away, is because quite
frankly, after that movie,

648
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:52,123
I'm fairly apprehensive of you,

649
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:54,425
and I imagine that most people

650
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,327
wouldn't really want to
sit beside you at dinner.

651
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:57,228
Would they?

652
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:01,966
- No, they all get up and leave.

653
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,968
When I go into a restaurant,
people just get up and leave.

654
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:08,173
No, people don't respond
in any different way.

655
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:10,208
I tell them I'm a vegetarian.

656
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:14,312
- With an
Oscar in his pocket,

657
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:16,948
Anthony Hopkins becomes
one of Hollywood's

658
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,383
highest paid actors.

659
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,653
In 1992, Francis Ford Coppola

660
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:25,056
offers him the role of the
vampire hunter in Dracula,

661
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:27,592
an adaptation of the
Bram Stoker novel.

662
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:29,594
Scar on his face,
crucifix in hand,

663
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:32,564
Anthony Hopkins
is in his element.

664
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:37,936
Alongside Gary Oldman
as Count Dracula,

665
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:40,238
Winona Ryder, and Keanu Reeves,

666
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:42,240
Anthony Hopkins immerses himself

667
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:45,510
in the obsessive filming and
rehearsals imposed by Coppola,

668
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:48,313
a man known to push his
actors to their limits.

669
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:53,184
- Let's
stop the presses.

670
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:55,153
- We don't
have to change it.

671
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,120
We don't have to print it out.

672
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:57,288
- No but we should.

673
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:58,256
You have all these reasons,

674
00:30:58,289 --> 00:30:59,591
every time we pin it down,

675
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:02,227
it's another nail
out of my coffin.

676
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,665
- We were up in Napa where
we started rehearsing

677
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,235
at his home, this
big sound stage.

678
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:12,270
And he said, "I want us to read

679
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:15,707
the whole book together, aloud."

680
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,175
It took two days.

681
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,676
And he said, "because
I want us to absorb,

682
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,645
all of us, to absorb the book."

683
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:24,115
It was a marathon
to read that book.

684
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:26,651
I don't have an analytical mind.

685
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:29,220
I'm not a very bright
or intellectual man.

686
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:34,425
So I have a good instinct.

687
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:37,295
And my theory, for
what it's worth,

688
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:40,632
is to know the text so
well, the script so well,

689
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:42,634
because the word is powerful.

690
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:45,336
That's all I have to do.

691
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,138
That's all I'm capable of doing.

692
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:49,741
I used to have a neurosis
about not learning lines

693
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:51,242
and not being able
to remember texts.

694
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:53,678
One of my actor's
nightmares is to show up

695
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:54,913
and not know the lines.

696
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:59,417
So maybe I overcompensate, but
I find that by learning it,

697
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:04,255
it gives me a sense
of ease and confidence

698
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:07,091
to walk on the set or the
stage of wherever I'm doing,

699
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:10,361
and know that I know,
that I know how to do it.

700
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:16,034
Well, that was a very
confined movie to be on

701
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:18,202
because Francis Ford Coppola,

702
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:22,473
brilliant director as he
is, he's a great controller.

703
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:23,474
He controls everything.

704
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:25,376
So you don't get much choice.

705
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:28,546
And I fought for my
choice to make Van Helsing

706
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:30,081
like an insane madman,

707
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:33,451
wanted him to be this
uproarious rebel,

708
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:37,055
and seer, and bad man.

709
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:40,124
I had a scar, he fought a
duel and all that stuff.

710
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:43,695
And so I concocted it myself,
I don't know how it came out.

711
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:47,065
Jesus, God, I command you
in the name of Christ!

712
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,004
No!

713
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,474
No!

714
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:59,811
And I had to take out
some rather

715
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:02,480
- In 1992,
there's a change of scenery

716
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:06,284
and a decisive encounter
in Anthony Hopkins career.

717
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,219
He joins the filming
of Howards End,

718
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:10,722
a period film directed
by James Ivory.

719
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:14,559
This film will mark
the beginning of
their collaboration,

720
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:17,328
which will continue with
The Remains of the Day,

721
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:19,030
and Surviving Picasso.

722
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:22,433
That's what I like

723
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:24,802
about working in film.

724
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,604
You just go along with it.

725
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,809
The more relaxed you are,
I think the easier it is.

726
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:35,847
And I like it this way
because it's effortless.

727
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:40,351
I learn the lines very very
well, and very methodically.

728
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:41,719
So that I can improvise,

729
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:45,790
and make them sound
real on each take.

730
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:46,791
Scene 59F, Take 1.

731
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:51,095
- So I don't have that
sweat or that tension,

732
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:53,531
by not knowing the lines.

733
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:55,666
My relationship to
directors has changed.

734
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,403
I used to fight
them, now I don't.

735
00:33:58,436 --> 00:33:59,570
I think that they do
the best they can,

736
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:01,406
and I do the best I can.

737
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:03,674
We seem to get on fine now,

738
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,210
which is a great
new change for me.

739
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:08,846
My dear Helen, I
grieve for your clerk.

740
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,314
I really do.

741
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:12,216
But it is all part of
the battle of life.

742
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,518
- The battle of life?

743
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:14,852
- Yes.

744
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:15,887
- A man who had
little money, has less.

745
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,155
Owing to us.

746
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:18,156
- Oh come, come.

747
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:18,823
Anyway, you're not to blame.

748
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:19,724
No one is to blame.

749
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:20,725
- No one?

750
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:22,527
Oh is no one to blame for it?

751
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,462
- I didn't say that.

752
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:26,264
You take things
far too seriously.

753
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:30,268
My dear Helen, I
grieve for your clerk.

754
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:31,536
I really do.

755
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,271
But it is all part of
the battle of life.

756
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:34,605
- The battle of life?

757
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,807
- Yes.

758
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,574
- A man who had little
money, has less.

759
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:37,608
Owing to us.

760
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:38,576
- Oh come, come.

761
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:39,577
You're not to blame.

762
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:40,445
No one is to blame.

763
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:41,512
- No one?

764
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:42,547
Is no one to blame for anything?

765
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,148
- I didn't say that.

766
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:45,917
You take things
far too seriously.

767
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,885
- How did you get a
handle on the character

768
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,487
you played in that?

769
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,755
- It was the mustache did it.

770
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:51,622
- Oh?

771
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:52,857
- Yeah.

772
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:55,259
So I went to the makeup
room and they said,

773
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:56,594
"Would you wear a
mustache in this?"

774
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:58,229
I said, "Well, I
haven't grown one, no."

775
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,198
She said, "Well, I've
got one for you."

776
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:01,399
I said, "Okay, well
let's put it on."

777
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,501
I put it on, and I
said, "There's the man."

778
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:06,204
And it made me feel
like my grandfather,

779
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:08,439
my father's father, he
was a strict Victorian.

780
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:11,409
And I looked in the mirror,
and I thought, "That's him."

781
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:12,543
And it did something to my eyes,

782
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:13,644
it did something to my face,

783
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:15,613
it give it a sort of edge.

784
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:17,415
And it made my eyes stand out.

785
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:18,916
I thought this man
is a ruthless man,

786
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,651
and he's a tough man,

787
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:22,820
and I could see him
in the dark suit.

788
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:24,856
So I didn't have to do
much work on top of that.

789
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:27,625
There is Henry Wilcox.

790
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:28,759
Henry.

791
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:33,364
I call it the mask, and it
doesn't even have to be makeup.

792
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:35,900
It can be a pair of shoes,
or it can be a jacket.

793
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:37,969
And I remember
Remains of the Day,

794
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:41,205
my first day was
wearing a rain coat.

795
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:44,709
Because it was raining,
and getting into a car,

796
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:46,344
and then turning
up on the location,

797
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:48,846
and I looked in the mirror
and it was my own grandfather

798
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,915
looking back at me.

799
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:55,820
He used to wear a coat like
that and a green felt hat.

800
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:57,455
And I looked, and I
thought, "That's him,"

801
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:00,558
and I felt everything
transform inside me slightly,

802
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:02,493
and it all came to life.

803
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,732
You must take good care
of yourself Mrs. Benn.

804
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:10,334
- You too, Mr. Stevens,
promise me that.

805
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,869
- Oh yes, I promise.

806
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:13,004
You must try to do all you can

807
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:14,839
to make these years happy ones

808
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:16,641
for yourself and
for your husband.

809
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:19,677
I don't know why I play
those repressed men.

810
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,546
Maybe I am like
that, I don't know.

811
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:22,847
I'm pretty shy.

812
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,284
I'm not very gregarious.

813
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:29,754
I'm not gregarious at all
really, I have very few friends,

814
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:33,758
but I'm happy in my way.

815
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:36,961
I like to be on my own a lot.

816
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:40,498
I'm married, and have a
wife, and a few friends,

817
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:44,902
but I prefer my own
company most of the time.

818
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:48,472
So maybe that's why they cast
me in these strange parts.

819
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:51,876
- Anthony Hopkins
and Emma Thompson reunite

820
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:54,712
in James Ivory's The
Remains of the Day,

821
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:56,414
a year after Howards End.

822
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,850
In this film, they play a
butler and a housekeeper

823
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,986
caught in a silent,
romantic relationship

824
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:04,755
subject to the weight
of conventions.

825
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:08,025
Here, Hopkins slips into the
skin of the most introverted,

826
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,529
subtle, and almost ghostly
character of his career.

827
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:14,732
- I'm invading your
private time. Am I?

828
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:15,633
- Yes.

829
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:18,803
- What's in that book?

830
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:20,805
Come on, let me see.

831
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,674
Or are you protecting me?

832
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:24,976
Is that what you're doing?

833
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:27,745
Would I be shocked?

834
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,915
- Anthony Hopkins is
the perfect repressed

835
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:33,451
English gentleman, because
he has all the niceties

836
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:34,418
on the outside, you know?

837
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:35,653
He knows how to be presentable,

838
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:40,358
and how to bring tea properly,

839
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:42,593
and yet you never
feel a coldness.

840
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:43,995
You always feel that underneath,

841
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:47,398
there's this terrifically
warm, big, beautiful heart

842
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,467
that yearns to come out.

843
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,736
And that's when those
movies really work,

844
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:55,339
when those very sort of
prissy English characters

845
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:56,774
aren't just what they
are on the outside,

846
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:58,609
but that you can intuit

847
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:00,544
that inside is somebody
who's really yearning

848
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:03,581
to get beyond this
Victorian repression.

849
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:05,816
- I read these books.

850
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:09,920
Any books to develop my command

851
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,922
and knowledge of the
English language.

852
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:16,527
I read to further my
education, Miss Kenton.

853
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,033
- But there were a few
things you do in Howards End,

854
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:23,734
which struck me as being
not only brilliant,

855
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:25,469
and very moving,

856
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:26,570
but also, I can't imagine
they were in the script.

857
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:29,373
In particular, the character
you play, Mr. Wilcox.

858
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:30,541
- Yeah.

859
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:33,044
- There are two events in
the movie when he's talking

860
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:34,779
about something
shameful in his past,

861
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:39,016
and both times he does not
wish to be looked upon.

862
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,785
He doesn't want to make
eye contact with his wife.

863
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,620
He kind of hides his face away.

864
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:43,587
Do you remember those ones?

865
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:44,455
- Oh, I did that.

866
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:45,523
- Yeah.

867
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:49,060
- So you were that
woman's lover?

868
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:53,497
- To put it with your
usual delicacy, yes, I was.

869
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:54,398
- When?

870
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:56,600
When, please?

871
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:57,635
- 10 years ago!

872
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:01,639
I'm sorry, 10 years ago.

873
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:05,142
I don't know, maybe I'd seen
it in a movie somewhere.

874
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:08,145
I think Charles Laughton did
it in Hunchback of Notre Dame

875
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,413
or something, he hid his face.

876
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:10,414
It may have been...

877
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:11,982
Yeah, I think it was that.

878
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:12,950
Maybe I stole it.

879
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:15,019
It's a good piece to steal.

880
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:18,689
He's, "How ugly I
am," and he put his...

881
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:20,925
I think I stole that.

882
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:22,159
- It's
a wonderful moment,

883
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,928
and it really breaks
through as well because-

884
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:25,730
- Oh, and then
he breaks down doesn't he,

885
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:26,964
at the end?

886
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:27,965
- At
the end he does, yeah.

887
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:29,100
- He couldn't
bear to be seen crying.

888
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:30,134
Yes, showing of emotion.

889
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,536
I'm sorry.

890
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,171
I think that's why I
have a lot in common

891
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,573
with these characters.

892
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:38,008
I don't like bearing
emotion much.

893
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,945
Maybe it's a British thing,
maybe it's a male thing.

894
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:42,213
But I don't like it.

895
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:45,216
I don't like displays
of tears and, you know.

896
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,592
- But I don't feel
like an actor.

897
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:56,794
I don't know what
the hell an actor is.

898
00:39:56,827 --> 00:40:00,564
I feel like I'm a member of
the circus most of the time.

899
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:01,799
You travel around the world.

900
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:03,734
You travel around,
you arrive in cities,

901
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:07,838
and arrive on locations, do
the job and then go home.

902
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:13,043
As I get older, I just feel
that's all I do is a job.

903
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:17,548
It's nothing more, nothing less.

904
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:20,184
It happens to be
well-paid and it's public.

905
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:23,554
And I have my father's attitude.

906
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,689
It's like my father
is inside me now.

907
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:28,793
The more I see photographs
of myself sometimes,

908
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:30,861
and I look just like my father.

909
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:34,498
And he's alive and
well in me, I think.

910
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:37,635
I have his attitudes, his
values, and all the rest of it.

911
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,137
He had a tough life

912
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:42,907
and I've had a very easy
life, comparatively.

913
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,209
Actually, I have a
very easy life, period.

914
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:47,611
I'm just one of those
very fortunate ones.

915
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:54,952
I tend to be very
unpredictable and moody.

916
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:59,690
See, I go into a situation and
say, "Oh hi there. Mm-hmm."

917
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:01,058
You know, I want to be liked.

918
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:04,195
So I go into a movie
set or to a new play,

919
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:07,631
whatever, and I'm Mr.
Friendly, Mr. Nice guy

920
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:09,166
because I want to be liked.

921
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,769
I want to be
pleasant to everyone.

922
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,737
And then suddenly
somebody steps on my toes,

923
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:16,006
and I go off like a firecracker.

924
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,542
- Got to see him on a
couple of cranky days,

925
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:21,712
when Sir Tony would turn cranky

926
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:24,048
and that was good fun,
very entertaining.

927
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:27,084
And I'm telling you
when Tony's cranky,

928
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:28,052
the Red Sea parts.

929
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:33,324
In fact, forget Moses,
if I was casting God,

930
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:35,559
I would cast Sir Tony.

931
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:38,028
Sir Anthony Hopkins,
because he has a force.

932
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,800
It's a romantic fantasy

933
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:46,971
I have of the loner,
the lone wolf who...

934
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:51,775
the lone person who
doesn't need any affection.

935
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:52,943
That's part of my
life, actually.

936
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:56,113
I think I can do very well
without affection and love.

937
00:41:57,948 --> 00:42:01,285
It doesn't bode well for
a good life, a full life,

938
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:03,721
but I am capable of
withdrawing from people

939
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:05,289
and closing myself off.

940
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:09,059
Maybe it's a form of martyrdom.

941
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:14,098
I used to turn
savagely on people.

942
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:16,233
I'd get rid of people,
get rid of friends

943
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:18,002
and they'd wonder
what had happened.

944
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:20,638
And then recently, over
the last year, I guess,

945
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,908
something changed in me,

946
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:26,010
and I thought life's too
short to do all this.

947
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,344
I have a few friends,

948
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,680
and I'm very lucky to
have them in my life.

949
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:31,582
Really lucky.

950
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:35,252
Because they see me walking
straight into the jaws of hell,

951
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:36,253
because I am naive.

952
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:38,088
I am easily taken in by people,

953
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:41,091
and that's my main
fault, I guess.

954
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:44,929
My main defect is
that I'm very naive.

955
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:49,633
I'm told that I have a
nature which is complex.

956
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:52,703
I don't feel complex actually,
I feel quite a simpleton.

957
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,942
- Anthony
Hopkins grew up thinking

958
00:42:57,975 --> 00:42:59,777
he wasn't worth much.

959
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:03,080
A withdrawn child without
any particular talent.

960
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:06,283
In Port Talbot, Wales,
people called him, "Dumbo".

961
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:10,354
Although he never
intended to get revenge,

962
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:12,656
he manages to find a
place in a Hollywood

963
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:15,292
that likes to
pigeonhole its actors.

964
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:17,294
He draws his strength and talent

965
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:19,396
from not fitting into any mold.

966
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:27,171
He proves it again,
when Oliver Stone,

967
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:29,940
against all expectations
chooses him,

968
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:32,242
the most English
actor in Hollywood

969
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:35,245
to play the typical
American by changing again.

970
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,948
But this time, in the
role of President Nixon.

971
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:44,321
- He was scared shitless

972
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:48,125
because, "How can I be Nixon?

973
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:50,461
They're going to
see me as a fraud."

974
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:52,863
You're Welsh,
you're not English.

975
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:54,198
You're Welsh, there's
a big difference.

976
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:55,466
And I said, "You're
halfway there already.

977
00:43:55,499 --> 00:43:56,900
You're in the Atlantic anyway.

978
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:59,003
You're not far."

979
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:00,871
I said, "There's
something in your spirit,

980
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:03,040
which is obstinate, stubborn,

981
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:06,310
and yet has a great
misunderstood quality."

982
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:08,812
- I've got to keep fighting,
Buddy, for the country.

983
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:12,216
These people running
things, the elite.

984
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:14,885
They're just soft
chicken-shit faggots.

985
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,822
They don't have the
long-term vision anymore.

986
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:21,258
They just want to cover
their ass, and meet girls,

987
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:23,427
and tear each other down.

988
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:27,831
Oh God, this country's in deep,
deep, deep trouble, Buddy.

989
00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:29,299
Got into the
psychology of the man.

990
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,467
I understood his paranoia.

991
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:35,072
I understood his
loneliness, his terrors,

992
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:40,144
his bleakness of life,
and the lies he told.

993
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:44,381
He was caught in a
morass of such lies.

994
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:49,753
And I felt sorry for him because
he was always the outsider.

995
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:03,734
When they look at you, they
see what they want to be.

996
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:11,141
When they look at me,
they see what they are.

997
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,247
Well I had no illusions I
was going to be Cary Grant

998
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:19,183
or Robert Redford.

999
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:21,852
And any moment that they tried
to do something like that

1000
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:24,455
or someone said, "This is a..."

1001
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:26,190
That sort of part to give me,

1002
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:31,328
I knew I was what they would
call a "character actor."

1003
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:36,266
Bly, I was always very chunky.

1004
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,401
I'm not a leading man actor.

1005
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:42,973
I'm not Brad Pitt, or Robert
Redford, or Tom Cruise.

1006
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:44,775
Those are leading movie stars.

1007
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:47,311
I'm not a movie star,
I'm a movie actor.

1008
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:51,982
- And it's in
Meet Joe Black in 1998,

1009
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:54,518
that the actor completely
changes his register.

1010
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:56,954
Playing a billionaire
at the end of his life,

1011
00:45:56,987 --> 00:45:59,423
opposite Brad Pitt,
who incarnates death

1012
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:01,992
coming to take him
on his last trip.

1013
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,028
- The question.

1014
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:12,536
- Am I going to die?

1015
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:24,581
- Yes.

1016
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:28,252
- This is the
second time that the two actors

1017
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:31,922
meet on a movie set, four
years after starring together

1018
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:33,157
in Legends of the Fall.

1019
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:37,194
There isn't an actor on one
side and a star on the other,

1020
00:46:37,227 --> 00:46:41,031
but rather two generations
that mirror each other.

1021
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:42,499
Their duo makes this film,

1022
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:45,102
which is often
underestimated by critics,

1023
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:48,238
an astonishing allegory
on life and death.

1024
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:52,409
- Who am I?

1025
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:05,189
- Death.

1026
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:08,659
- How would I want
to be remembered?

1027
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:11,028
I certainly don't want any
longer to be remembered

1028
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:12,963
as that nice guy, you know?

1029
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,932
The guy who does the Tommy
Cooper jokes anymore.

1030
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:16,600
I don't want to be that anymore.

1031
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:20,003
I don't really give a damn.

1032
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:34,051
Should I be afraid?

1033
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:37,621
- Not a man like you.

1034
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,166
- We should
bring in a better light.

1035
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:51,435
- In 2001,
he returns to the cell

1036
00:47:51,468 --> 00:47:53,403
that made him an icon.

1037
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:56,073
10 years after The
Silence of The Lambs,

1038
00:47:56,106 --> 00:47:59,343
Anthony Hopkins puts on the
Hannibal Lecter mask again,

1039
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:02,079
and plays in the two other
films in the trilogy,

1040
00:48:02,112 --> 00:48:04,081
Hannibal and Red Dragon.

1041
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:10,120
- I did have some misgivings
about doing this third one

1042
00:48:10,153 --> 00:48:12,623
because I thought,
"Well I've done it now.

1043
00:48:12,656 --> 00:48:14,091
So I can't get any more
mileage out of it,"

1044
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:17,261
because it becomes
boring and tedious.

1045
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:21,431
And I thought, "Well, it
wouldn't harm to do one more,"

1046
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:24,701
as long as I'm more of a
background figure, I think.

1047
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:26,303
More of a shadowy figure.

1048
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,274
I can't go on hitting the
bullseye all the time.

1049
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:32,109
You're going to
make some bad films,

1050
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:34,444
and I made a number
of bad films.

1051
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:39,483
I made probably on one
hand, maybe four good films.

1052
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:41,385
Most of the ones
have been mediocre.

1053
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:48,158
I am a terrible liar, you
see, I'll tell my agent,

1054
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:49,526
"Yeah, I've read the script."

1055
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:51,762
And then I wake up after
they've committed me

1056
00:48:51,795 --> 00:48:53,363
and I say, "God almighty."

1057
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:55,198
I did that recently on the
thing called Bad Company.

1058
00:48:55,232 --> 00:48:57,134
I thought, "What the hell
have I done this for?"

1059
00:48:57,167 --> 00:48:59,136
But I tend to do that
because I'm stupid,

1060
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:00,771
or greedy, or impatient.

1061
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:02,239
And I think if I
don't say, "Yes,"

1062
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:03,540
they'll give it
to somebody else.

1063
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:06,043
Those are my motives.

1064
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:08,378
That's what a
refined actor I am,

1065
00:49:08,412 --> 00:49:10,347
how I've planned my career.

1066
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,582
- Anthony
Hopkins spends the 2000s

1067
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:14,151
moving from set to set.

1068
00:49:14,184 --> 00:49:16,219
He has a series of blockbusters,

1069
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:18,522
such as Thor and Transformers,

1070
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:20,557
but he returns to
what he does best

1071
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,259
in the biopic Hitchcock,

1072
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:25,262
in which he brings the famous
English suspense genius,

1073
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:27,664
Sir Alfred Hitchcock to life.

1074
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:30,434
The film highlights the
influence of his wife, Alma,

1075
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:33,103
played by Helen Mirren,
on the master's work.

1076
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:36,473
- Just think of the shock value.

1077
00:49:36,506 --> 00:49:40,243
Killing off your leading
lady halfway through.

1078
00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:45,282
I mean you are intrigued,
are you not my dear?

1079
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,453
Come on, admit it.

1080
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:50,354
Admit it.

1081
00:49:51,555 --> 00:49:53,657
- Actually I think
it's a huge mistake.

1082
00:49:58,161 --> 00:49:59,596
You shouldn't wait
until halfway through,

1083
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:01,732
kill her off after 30 minutes.

1084
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,035
- Well.

1085
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:09,806
- Fortunately,
Hitchcock listened to his wife

1086
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:13,176
and killed his heroin
after more than 30 minutes.

1087
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:16,646
Today, the shower scene is
recognized as a classic.

1088
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,814
- More, more!

1089
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:19,783
- No.

1090
00:50:19,816 --> 00:50:20,650
- Use some guts!

1091
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:22,552
- C'mon!

1092
00:50:22,586 --> 00:50:23,553
- Ow, ow.

1093
00:50:23,587 --> 00:50:25,322
- No, more anger!

1094
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:26,656
- Ow.

1095
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:27,924
- All right, cut, cut, cut!

1096
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:32,496
For god's sake, would someone
get me a proper stunt double?

1097
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:34,464
Now give me the knife.

1098
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:36,133
Like this!

1099
00:50:37,901 --> 00:50:39,403
Ungovernable rage!

1100
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:44,775
Homicidal violence!

1101
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:48,111
- You've never
really done anything

1102
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:49,880
as good as Psycho, have you?

1103
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:51,248
- Psycho?

1104
00:50:52,249 --> 00:50:53,483
Should I tell you that story?

1105
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:55,118
Yeah, somebody asked me
for my autograph once,

1106
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:57,220
and I went up and
signed this autograph

1107
00:50:57,254 --> 00:50:58,555
and she said, "You
don't look anything

1108
00:50:58,588 --> 00:51:00,157
like you did in Psycho."

1109
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:01,558
- Is it in just the
name, Hopkins, Perkins?

1110
00:51:01,591 --> 00:51:03,660
- Hopkins, Perkins,
I think they get...

1111
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:08,231
I promise you, I
was down in Bristol.

1112
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:10,534
I was filming with
Lesley Ann Down.

1113
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:14,738
The assistant director said,
"The station master's wife

1114
00:51:14,771 --> 00:51:15,705
would love to see you.

1115
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:16,807
She's a great fan of yours."

1116
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,508
I said, "Oh, show me the way."

1117
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:20,877
So, we went in and I thought,
"Well, where is she?"

1118
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:23,146
And she said, "Oh,
you don't look

1119
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,315
anything like you
did in Psycho."

1120
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:27,784
So, I ripped her curtains off

1121
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:29,786
and stabbed her with my biro.

1122
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:32,389
- You signed the
name Anthony Perkins.

1123
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:33,290
- That's right.

1124
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:45,869
- So anyone who says
"It's lonely at the top,"

1125
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:49,139
either needs a good psychiatrist
or a kick in the ass.

1126
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:51,675
It's nice being successful.

1127
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:53,210
It's good.

1128
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:54,644
It's very, very good.

1129
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:56,546
Fucking good, yeah.

1130
00:51:57,647 --> 00:51:59,483
I enjoy it.

1131
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:00,484
I have a good life.

1132
00:52:00,517 --> 00:52:03,687
I have a lot of fun, no
regrets, no complaints.

1133
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,822
If it all ended
tomorrow, so be it.

1134
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:08,525
I've had a good time.

1135
00:52:11,561 --> 00:52:13,830
I was very surprised
by the knighthood.

1136
00:52:13,864 --> 00:52:15,765
Very, very surprised,
very honored.

1137
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,267
I didn't know what had...

1138
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:20,604
My wife phoned me up
while I was down in Bath,

1139
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:21,771
doing Remains of the Day.

1140
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:24,608
She phoned me, she said, "You've
been given a knighthood."

1141
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:25,575
I said, "What for?"

1142
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:26,843
She said, "I don't know."

1143
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:28,211
And I said, I didn't know.

1144
00:52:28,245 --> 00:52:29,679
I was quite speechless
for many days.

1145
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:30,981
Of course, I was
sworn to secrecy.

1146
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:32,782
You're not supposed
to tell anyone.

1147
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:34,351
But it was, I mean,
it's a great honor

1148
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:39,489
and I try to wear it as
comfortably as I can.

1149
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:43,426
If people call me Mr. Hopkins
instead of Sir Anthony,

1150
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,495
I don't have a conniption fit.

1151
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:47,264
I'm very happy
with what everyone,

1152
00:52:47,297 --> 00:52:48,798
In America, they
say "Sir Hopkins."

1153
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,500
Oh, I say, "Just call me Tony,"

1154
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:52,435
because they get
it all wrong there.

1155
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:56,740
But it's very, very, very nice.

1156
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:06,550
- I've been asked to write a
biography, an autobiography,

1157
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:07,918
and I haven't a clue,
and I keep doing it,

1158
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:10,387
and I keep deleting it
all from the computer.

1159
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,555
Because I look at it,

1160
00:53:11,588 --> 00:53:12,989
and I thought, "What am I
writing all this stuff for?"

1161
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:14,724
Because I don't want
to go back to the past.

1162
00:53:14,758 --> 00:53:16,459
I don't want to go back
and examine my childhood.

1163
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:17,827
I had a perfectly
fine childhood.

1164
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:21,898
I had a confused school
career, but that was all,

1165
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:25,635
I mean nothing really
untoward has happened to me.

1166
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:27,504
I drank a bit too much,
stopped doing that,

1167
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:31,741
and then my life really
started to take flower then.

1168
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:32,876
I get out in the
morning, out of bed,

1169
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:34,578
and you know, I'm getting old.

1170
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:38,882
And as I get out of bed,
"Oh, dear God, right move!"

1171
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:42,018
I get up, and I think,
"Right. I'm alive.

1172
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:45,622
Life's in Session. It's
not a rehearsal. Move,"

1173
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:47,390
and that's what I do.

1174
00:53:55,765 --> 00:53:57,601
And now I can make
some bad films,

1175
00:53:57,634 --> 00:53:59,302
and it doesn't matter anymore.

1176
00:53:59,336 --> 00:54:00,537
I don't have to prove it.

1177
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:01,504
It's like all
those little doubts

1178
00:54:01,538 --> 00:54:04,407
that started way back
when I was a child.

1179
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:07,010
It's like a voice
inside me says,

1180
00:54:07,043 --> 00:54:10,413
"See you weren't that dumb.
You were just different."
