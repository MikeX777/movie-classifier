00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:07,875
STARVISION PRESENTS

2
00:00:10,708 --> 00:00:11,625
Honey, let's go and see!

3
00:00:11,917 --> 00:00:14,000
A FILM BY ATTA HALILINTAR

4
00:00:14,167 --> 00:00:14,958
Check!

5
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:16,500
Sir, look!

6
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:18,332
Gosh, that guy again.

7
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:19,333
This will cause a commotion.

8
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:23,374
One, two, three.

9
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:25,207
Seven, eight.

10
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:27,042
- Nine.
- No, that's wrong.

11
00:00:27,292 --> 00:00:28,792
After three, comes four.

12
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:31,125
Then five, six, seven.

13
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:32,833
Yes, Sis.

14
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:34,750
Hey, it's Brother Zul!

15
00:00:34,792 --> 00:00:36,292
Brother Zul!

16
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:39,250
I'm ready!

17
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:47,375
Excuse us!

18
00:00:47,917 --> 00:00:49,042
Hey, Zul!

19
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:51,583
Zul!

20
00:00:53,417 --> 00:00:54,000
Where's Zul?

21
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:57,500
Don't panic.
I can't be dead yet.

22
00:00:57,667 --> 00:01:00,416
Why would a main cast die so early?

23
00:01:00,417 --> 00:01:01,499
He's not coming up.

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,417
Zul drowned?

25
00:01:02,418 --> 00:01:04,666
First of all, may peace be upon you.

26
00:01:04,667 --> 00:01:06,208
Second, this is not a prank.

27
00:01:06,292 --> 00:01:06,708
Zul!

28
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:09,166
Because this is a movie,
not a YouTube video.

29
00:01:09,167 --> 00:01:12,499
Third, I'd like to tell
a story about a boy...

30
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,375
...who has been different
since he was a kid.

31
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:18,000
Father, I can't!

32
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:20,249
Father, I can't!

33
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,333
Calm down, Zul. Don't be afraid.

34
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,208
I'm here.

35
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,250
Very good!

36
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:28,875
That's my father, he's a kind man.

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,081
MR. IBRAHIM - TRAVELLED TO
JAKARTA, CATFISH RICE SELLER

38
00:01:29,082 --> 00:01:31,583
MR. IBRAHIM - TRAVELLED TO JAKARTA, CATFISH
RICE SELLER I learned a lot from him.

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So, how was school?

40
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:35,166
Thank goodness it went well, Father.

41
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:36,999
It did? Did the teacher come?

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Of course, Father.

43
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:40,875
Alright then.

44
00:01:40,917 --> 00:01:43,917
Now you go play with your friends.

45
00:01:51,417 --> 00:01:52,958
What are "friends", Father?

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,375
Friends are people that you have to defend.

47
00:01:57,792 --> 00:02:01,207
Because then, they too will defend you.

48
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:03,792
Alright? Now go play nicely.

49
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:05,167
Hey, smile.

50
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:13,500
Where are they?

51
00:02:16,542 --> 00:02:18,625
You! Such a bad boy!

52
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:20,667
You ruined my stand!

53
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:22,333
Ow, it hurts!

54
00:02:22,334 --> 00:02:26,000
Now you have to be responsible
and clean my stand!

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,375
I'm Aisyah.

56
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:40,375
Zul.

57
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,041
Why did you admit that it was your mistake?

58
00:02:51,042 --> 00:02:54,125
You knew nothing about it.

59
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,583
If you want to defend people...

60
00:02:57,208 --> 00:03:00,875
...first you have to know the difference
between right and wrong.

61
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:02,000
Yes?

62
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:04,750
Follow your conscience, Zul.

63
00:03:04,917 --> 00:03:06,625
Your conscience is always right.

64
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:10,417
That's right, and always
listen to your mother.

65
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:12,542
That too.

66
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,667
Just like your conscience.

67
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,792
Women are always right.

68
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,582
That one's my mother.

69
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:19,666
Although she argues a lot with Father...

70
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:21,124
MRS. IBRAHIM - CREATOR OF PADANG SAUCE CHICKEN
RICE Although she argues a lot with Father...

71
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,458
MRS. IBRAHIM - CREATOR OF PADANG
SAUCE CHICKEN RICE ...they both love me.

72
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,833
AT-TAUBAH PRAYER ROOM

73
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,625
From Mother, I learned about tidiness.

74
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:37,958
She said with tidiness,
we can please other people.

75
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,125
Truly awesome.

76
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:48,292
Father, why must we salute the flag?

77
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:54,375
Our flag is a symbol of our freedom.

78
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:57,167
In the past, our nation had heroes.

79
00:03:58,167 --> 00:04:00,458
They fought, sacrificed.

80
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:03,708
To free us from colonialism.

81
00:04:04,042 --> 00:04:05,875
From injustice.

82
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:07,792
Do you understand?

83
00:04:08,417 --> 00:04:09,167
I understand.

84
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:10,875
Help people, Father.

85
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:12,958
Like superheroes?

86
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:14,542
Something like that.

87
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:18,625
But one thing's for sure,
we must always remember our heroes...

88
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:23,833
...by always paying
respect to our national flag.

89
00:04:24,042 --> 00:04:26,667
The sacred Red and White.

90
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:31,167
Salute up!

91
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:35,292
Salute down!

92
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,207
Flags and poles.

93
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:39,333
Goodness.

94
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,583
Zul, where are you going?

95
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:45,707
Since I heard my father's
story about heroes...

96
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,707
...I knew my dream.

97
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,833
I knew what I wanted to become.

98
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:52,792
So you want to be a hero, Zul?

99
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,542
A superhero? That's fine.

100
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:59,082
As long as it motivates you
to do good for you and others.

101
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,708
Zul!

102
00:05:01,292 --> 00:05:03,333
Surprise.

103
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:08,375
We wish you a long life and health.

104
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:11,958
We wish you a long and noble life.

105
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:19,708
And a noble life.

106
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:21,542
Blow the candle.

107
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:27,208
A present from us...

108
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,958
...for our beloved boy.

109
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,292
- What is this?
- Just open it.

110
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,542
It's a superhero cape.

111
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,208
For my beloved boy.

112
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,458
I had no choice.

113
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,625
I had to cut it into a cape.

114
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,875
You're so reckless.

115
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,917
- I feel sorry for Zul.
- It's alright.

116
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,875
Look, he's happy.

117
00:05:57,542 --> 00:06:00,082
Yay, Zul is now a superhero, Father!

118
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,583
"Zul, enemy to the right!"

119
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:02,625
I'm ready!

120
00:06:02,626 --> 00:06:03,875
"Zul, catch that thief!"

121
00:06:03,917 --> 00:06:05,083
I'm ready!

122
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,583
"Zul, the cops need your help!"

123
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,250
I'm ready!

124
00:06:09,292 --> 00:06:12,417
Zul! We've found your superhero name.

125
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,542
Ashiap Man!

126
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:18,625
Ashiap Man!

127
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:19,625
I'm ready!

128
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,541
So that's a small part of my childhood.

129
00:06:26,542 --> 00:06:27,750
- Hi, Zul.
- Hi, Sir!

130
00:06:27,792 --> 00:06:29,792
Now I'm all grown up.

131
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:31,083
Excuse me, Sir.

132
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:31,958
I'm ready!

133
00:06:34,042 --> 00:06:35,625
Why am I imitating him?

134
00:06:37,542 --> 00:06:38,042
Down.

135
00:06:38,542 --> 00:06:40,708
- May peace be upon you, Mrs. Ijah.
- And upon you as well, Zul.

136
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,875
Bring them inside.

137
00:06:42,042 --> 00:06:45,250
To fulfill my dream, I
have to keep working.

138
00:06:45,417 --> 00:06:48,458
Help my parents, and help others.

139
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,749
Zul, I'll pay you later
this afternoon, okay?

140
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,583
Also, please fix my roof.
It was leaking yesterday.

141
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,292
I'm ready, Mrs. Ijah!

142
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,417
Alright.

143
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,750
- Zul!
- Hey!

144
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:11,999
Don't forget our plans for tonight.

145
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,333
I'm ready!

146
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:14,917
Don't be late, Zul.

147
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,042
Excuse me, Sir.

148
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,458
May peace be upon you.

149
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,250
And upon you as well.

150
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,542
Hi, Brother Zul.

151
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,458
I'm delivering your water.

152
00:07:34,417 --> 00:07:37,083
That's Aisyah, she's all grown up too.

153
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,499
And still pretty.

154
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,166
But most importantly,
Aisyah is a nice girl.

155
00:07:41,167 --> 00:07:45,208
She runs a shelter house
for homeless kids with no parents.

156
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,333
Ouch!

157
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:52,750
One.

158
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:53,958
One more.

159
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:58,667
Two.

160
00:08:01,042 --> 00:08:02,750
One more thing, Little Aisyah.

161
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:03,667
What is it?

162
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:06,583
This.

163
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:12,791
Wink, wink!

164
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,750
Brother Zul, tell us more about Ashiap Man.

165
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,333
Who did he help yesterday?

166
00:08:18,542 --> 00:08:19,707
Come on, Brother Zul!

167
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,542
- Hey. Zul.
- Tell us more stories.

168
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:25,750
This guy is Ben.
He's my true hater.

169
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,750
Acting like a superhero.

170
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,707
But since the Green Ogre era...

171
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,874
...your only power is
lifting water gallons.

172
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,083
What a poser.

173
00:08:33,167 --> 00:08:34,917
If you get hit, I bet
you'll cry to your mom.

174
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:38,083
The kids are studying.

175
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,250
Don't be noisy.

176
00:08:39,542 --> 00:08:41,375
And stop bothering Zul.

177
00:08:42,417 --> 00:08:44,292
Gosh, Little Aisyah.

178
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:46,042
Little Aisyah.

179
00:08:46,542 --> 00:08:47,542
Listen to me.

180
00:08:48,292 --> 00:08:49,458
Open your eyes.

181
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,500
Take a look at that Zul.

182
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,125
From head to toe, and
back to the armpits...

183
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,458
He is weird!

184
00:08:58,625 --> 00:08:59,500
What?

185
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,375
I'm sorry, Zul.

186
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:03,583
We haven't gotten enough
donations for the shelter.

187
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,875
Can I pay for the water later?

188
00:09:05,917 --> 00:09:07,500
It's alright, Little Aisyah.

189
00:09:09,542 --> 00:09:11,792
You can pay with these.

190
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,166
That's a drawing of Sis Aisyah!

191
00:09:15,167 --> 00:09:16,458
Yes, I know.

192
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,374
Do you have more drawings of her?

193
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:19,792
Me, me!

194
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:20,500
Zul!

195
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,875
Won't you draw me too?
Look at my sexy pose.

196
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:27,750
- May peace be upon you.
- And upon you as well.

197
00:09:30,042 --> 00:09:32,624
Hello, guys! You're back with us...

198
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,374
I have these two good friends.

199
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,666
They always support and encourage me...

200
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:38,708
...to gain real superhero powers.

201
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:40,750
Here's one of our stories.

202
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:44,541
Can Zul finally become a superhero...

203
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,750
...by gaining the power of the lightning?

204
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,958
Remember, kids.

205
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,083
This is really dangerous.

206
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:59,625
Do not recreate or imitate.

207
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,875
You can do it, Zul!

208
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,750
- For our content.
- Content.

209
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:10,917
I'm going to be a superhero!

210
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,333
Zul, did you get it?

211
00:10:31,292 --> 00:10:34,917
This must be one of his lightning powers.

212
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,667
Come on, Zul. Show us your lightning power.

213
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:41,707
I've prepared a superhero name
if you succeed.

214
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,708
Zul Halilintar (Zul Lightning)!

215
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,750
Hello, guys.

216
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:53,707
Today we'll conduct an experiment.

217
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,958
To make Zul stronger.

218
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,249
Alright!

219
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:01,958
In this video, we will try to get Zul
bitten by spiders.

220
00:11:04,292 --> 00:11:07,500
Will Zul survive and become stronger?

221
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,291
Uh, Diana.

222
00:11:10,292 --> 00:11:12,207
Can I really become like Spider-Man?

223
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:13,999
Relax, Zul. After this...

224
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,542
...you'll be stronger than Spider-Man.

225
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:18,125
Come, come.

226
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:19,292
Ready?

227
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:20,583
Okay?

228
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:25,207
FIVE MINUTES LATER
Now what, Jon?

229
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:25,792
FIVE MINUTES LATER

230
00:11:25,793 --> 00:11:27,333
FIVE MINUTES LATER
Maybe the spiders are fasting.

231
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,166
Bro, Miss, sorry.
I'm rescuing a snake.

232
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:44,083
Did you see a large snake coming here?

233
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,333
Here, Bro.

234
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,250
Finally.

235
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,875
I've been chasing you all over.

236
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:58,916
Here you are.

237
00:11:58,917 --> 00:12:00,500
Gosh.

238
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,125
But it looks like he just had a bite.

239
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,750
Bro, that snake just bit my friend.

240
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:07,666
- Huh? Seriously?
- There!

241
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:08,458
Me, Bro.

242
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:09,375
Did he really bite you?

243
00:12:09,376 --> 00:12:10,417
Yes, Bro.

244
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:13,416
Did you know that
he's one of the top ten...

245
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:15,417
...world's most venomous snake?

246
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:16,250
Goodness!

247
00:12:16,251 --> 00:12:18,417
If you get bitten, you might...

248
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:19,583
Feel itchy?

249
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,750
You might die, Bro. Pass away.

250
00:12:21,792 --> 00:12:23,750
Can a person really die from itchiness?

251
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,167
Die from itchiness?

252
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,375
Bro, Miss, I'm done here.

253
00:12:28,917 --> 00:12:30,166
I need to go, thank you.

254
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:31,042
Yes, you're welcome!

255
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,458
These people are weird.

256
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,500
Careful!

257
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,417
Gosh!

258
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,667
- Zul.
- Yes, Mother?

259
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:05,292
Please give it up.

260
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:08,375
You're a grown man.

261
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,542
Stop dreaming of becoming a superhero.

262
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,750
Who will you fight?

263
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,958
We no longer need heroes.

264
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,625
Our country is free, Zul.

265
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:30,041
Of all of my wondrous stories...

266
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:33,958
...this is the origin story of Ashiap Man.

267
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,583
Get her!

268
00:13:40,292 --> 00:13:41,417
Damn intruder!

269
00:14:39,542 --> 00:14:41,208
- Who are you people?
- Move aside!

270
00:14:42,292 --> 00:14:44,082
Why are you standing here? Get her!

271
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,083
- Get her!
- Out of the way!

272
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:59,832
This cool, bald but evil guy...

273
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,542
...he's not Daddy Man.

274
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:02,917
He's called DP Man.

275
00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:07,000
Not "Down Payment".
That's just his name.

276
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:09,542
He likes to terrorize the village folks.

277
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,125
- Where is that girl?
- We don't know, DP Man Sir.

278
00:15:13,292 --> 00:15:14,250
She's gone.

279
00:15:14,251 --> 00:15:16,292
People don't just disappear! Find her!

280
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:18,833
Or I'll cancel all of your DPs!

281
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,125
Cancel yourself, DP Man Sir?

282
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,667
Your down payments, I will cancel them!

283
00:15:25,917 --> 00:15:26,917
Go find her!

284
00:15:26,918 --> 00:15:28,375
- Yes, hurry!
- Yes, Bos.

285
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
May peace be upon you,
my most beautiful mother.

286
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,333
I have finished delivering water gallons.

287
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,583
I need to go.

288
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:55,500
Zul, what do you say if...

289
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,499
...I sell Father's motorbike?

290
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,792
We might get enough money
to cover our daily needs.

291
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:04,124
Mother, we've had this bike
since you and Father dated.

292
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:07,042
Please don't sell it, Mother.
There are so many memories.

293
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,958
I need to go. May peace be upon you.

294
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,875
And upon you as well.

295
00:16:11,876 --> 00:16:13,250
I'm ready!

296
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,708
Hey, it's Brother Zul!

297
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,208
Brother Zul!

298
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,875
Zul!

299
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,750
Where's Zul?

300
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:31,708
Zul!

301
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,125
Why isn't he coming up?

302
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:35,542
Maybe he got eaten by a monster.

303
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,792
Huh, what monster?

304
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,250
A sucker fish monster.

305
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:40,583
Zul!

306
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,750
There he is!

307
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,917
See? I'm not dead.

308
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:51,083
And my story has just begun.

309
00:17:02,042 --> 00:17:03,792
Throw it, Zul!

310
00:17:12,792 --> 00:17:14,708
Normal people go diving...

311
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,291
...at the sea, not a river.

312
00:17:17,292 --> 00:17:20,291
Let him be. He's cleaning our river,
to help reduce flooding.

313
00:17:20,292 --> 00:17:21,792
Again, again!

314
00:17:28,542 --> 00:17:29,250
Brother.

315
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:31,250
Another one.

316
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:32,500
Thanks, Zul.

317
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,500
Sorry, Bro.

318
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:43,292
Hey, I found a chain for your motorbike.

319
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:44,875
I'll put it here.

320
00:17:45,292 --> 00:17:46,292
Thank you.

321
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:05,583
What a beautiful creation of God.

322
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:06,792
So pretty.

323
00:18:07,917 --> 00:18:09,125
I think she's a a social media celebrity.

324
00:18:09,292 --> 00:18:10,333
Make a Boomerang.

325
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,874
A dead body!

326
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,375
Is she alive or dead?

327
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,792
Calm down, everyone.

328
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:19,292
Leave it to the authorities, okay?

329
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:25,792
It looks like she needs CPR.

330
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:32,291
You just can't stand to see pretty
girls, can you? Always ready to kiss.

331
00:18:32,292 --> 00:18:34,625
Well, that's the procedure.

332
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,917
Ladies and gentlemen, she's still alive!

333
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,750
Well now this won't go viral.

334
00:18:49,917 --> 00:18:52,167
You're still thinking about going viral?

335
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,542
What to do, Mr. Security?
Where should we take her?

336
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,250
Let's take her to...

337
00:18:56,292 --> 00:18:57,333
The shelter.

338
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,500
Right, let's take her to the shelter.

339
00:18:59,542 --> 00:19:01,417
Alright, pick her up.

340
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:04,292
- This won't go trending.
- Careful.

341
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:12,125
Praise be to Allah, you're awake, Miss.

342
00:19:18,542 --> 00:19:22,124
I'm sorry, I changed your clothes.

343
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,167
I washed the dirty ones.

344
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:26,833
Where am I?

345
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,250
You're in my shelter.

346
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,417
I'm Aisyah.

347
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,833
These are the orphans under my care.

348
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:44,167
Your hand was hurt, but I tended it.

349
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,208
You're so smart.

350
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,207
Tending my hand.

351
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:51,792
Yes, Sis. I learned it
from YouTube tutorials.

352
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:54,667
YouTube?

353
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,999
What's with my head?

354
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,750
Your head was fine.

355
00:20:02,792 --> 00:20:05,249
But I always see it on TV.

356
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,250
No matter the illness, the head is
always wrapped up in bandages.

357
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:10,292
So I just did the same.

358
00:20:11,292 --> 00:20:12,792
Please excuse the kids.

359
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,125
Yes, it's alright.

360
00:20:17,792 --> 00:20:18,708
Oh right.

361
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:21,958
I think someone rescued me.

362
00:20:22,292 --> 00:20:23,458
He has a curly hair.

363
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,708
Oh, that's Ashiap Man!

364
00:20:26,042 --> 00:20:27,500
His name is Brother Zul.

365
00:20:27,542 --> 00:20:30,625
He's our village's hero.

366
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:32,667
I'm ready!

367
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,375
Hey, there's Zul.

368
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,708
Zul, come on in.

369
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:41,458
Hi.

370
00:20:45,792 --> 00:20:46,792
Bye.

371
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:06,874
Wink, wink, Zul!

372
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:07,625
Zul.

373
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:09,250
You're not nervous, right?

374
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:11,792
You don't misbehave
next to pretty girls, right?

375
00:21:13,042 --> 00:21:15,458
Of course, you see me everyday.

376
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,167
And I'm still nervous even now.

377
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,667
- Zul.
- Yes, Father?

378
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,708
Who was that girl you helped at the river?

379
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,707
Kiara Asyifa, that's her name.

380
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:30,917
According to her ID.

381
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,375
Why did she dive into the river?

382
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:38,625
Isn't that what you always do?

383
00:21:38,667 --> 00:21:41,667
And heartbroken people.

384
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,250
And penniless people.

385
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:46,000
Zul has a crush on that girl, Sir.

386
00:21:47,542 --> 00:21:50,042
Goodness.

387
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:53,167
If that's so, Zul, you
have to be her friend.

388
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,000
When you two are as close as friends...

389
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:59,000
And when she gives you signals like this...

390
00:22:00,167 --> 00:22:02,458
...then you can make it official.

391
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,250
Official, Father?

392
00:22:04,542 --> 00:22:06,208
You mean you want to get married again?

393
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:11,000
Not me, you!

394
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:13,000
Zul.

395
00:22:13,042 --> 00:22:15,917
As a girl, when I see a guy...

396
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,082
...I'll check his style first.

397
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,874
If you look like this...

398
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:21,792
Gosh, that's tough.

399
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:22,999
- Tough, huh?
- Needs a lot of work.

400
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,333
Relax, we'll give you an upgrade.

401
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:27,958
Not just an upgrade, we'll reinstall him.

402
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:29,333
Hey.

403
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,417
Don't just upgrade your
physical appearance.

404
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:33,667
Don't just reinstall your body.

405
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:35,750
But upgrade your heart as well.

406
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:37,916
You must become good people.

407
00:22:37,917 --> 00:22:40,875
And being good must come from the heart.

408
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:43,708
I pray that you will stay as good people.

409
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:46,792
And be surrounded by good people.

410
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:49,500
- Amen.
- Praise be to Allah.

411
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:55,500
Come on, Zul. Let's be stylish.

412
00:22:59,292 --> 00:23:02,041
Yeah, are you ready, audience?

413
00:23:02,042 --> 00:23:05,833
- I'm ready!
- Please welcome a singer with a thunderous voice!

414
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:08,292
Zul!

415
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:27,458
Presenting the most
stylish shirt of 2020, Zul!

416
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:30,374
Zul, come out and show your charm!

417
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:31,833
What do you say? Cool?

418
00:23:32,167 --> 00:23:34,875
You want one too? Here you go.

419
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:38,167
This is your style, Fool.
No girl would want Zul.

420
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,500
Go get changed, Zul!

421
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,417
Okay, guys. This is
the latest style from Zul.

422
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:45,292
YARD SALE

423
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:47,333
JUST SOMETHING

424
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:49,208
THIS IS IT

425
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,292
JUST ALLOW IT
Don't forget the hair gel, guys.

426
00:23:50,293 --> 00:23:51,958
Don't forget the hair gel, guys.

427
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:55,708
Make it stickier!

428
00:24:26,417 --> 00:24:27,458
May peace be upon you.

429
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:32,375
And upon you as well.

430
00:24:40,917 --> 00:24:41,708
What's this?

431
00:24:41,917 --> 00:24:44,000
Catfish rice, made by my father.

432
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:48,167
If you like it, I'll bring more tomorrow.

433
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,542
Or tomorrow morning.

434
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:53,167
Or tomorrow afternoon.

435
00:24:54,958 --> 00:24:56,542
Tomorrow night is fine too.

436
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:58,792
Do you eat catfish three times a day?

437
00:24:59,292 --> 00:25:01,708
I'm sorry, I don't mean to brag.

438
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:08,750
I bet this is your lunch box.

439
00:25:16,917 --> 00:25:18,458
That's Diana and Jon.

440
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,708
They're eavesdropping.

441
00:25:20,458 --> 00:25:22,458
To check if I can get close to you or not.

442
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,833
What are you two doing
at the corner like this?

443
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,083
Are you two dating?

444
00:25:29,458 --> 00:25:30,958
That's my intention, Sir.

445
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:33,958
You wish. Not a good match.

446
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,458
If you two get married, your
child will look like a zebra.

447
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:40,167
- Zul.
- Hi, Mr. Hans.

448
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:43,500
Miss, are you feeling better?

449
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:44,583
I am.

450
00:25:44,917 --> 00:25:47,125
Anyway, if there's any
trouble around here...

451
00:25:47,167 --> 00:25:49,292
...just call me, Mr. Hans.

452
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:51,083
- Alright?
- Alright.

453
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:53,083
- Alright.
- Yeah.

454
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:55,292
What do you mean, "yeah"?

455
00:25:55,875 --> 00:25:57,958
Be gone, eavesdroppers.

456
00:25:58,667 --> 00:26:00,125
Good luck with your approach, Zul.

457
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:01,833
Wish me luck too, Sir.

458
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:05,874
Zul, "Keeper Nogo".

459
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:07,875
Keep her close, don't let go.

460
00:26:07,917 --> 00:26:10,250
- I'm ready, Mr. Hans.
- Alright.

461
00:26:15,667 --> 00:26:17,208
Are you...

462
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:19,458
Trying to get close to me?

463
00:26:19,667 --> 00:26:20,500
Yes.

464
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:39,417
Sorry.

465
00:26:42,542 --> 00:26:44,333
- What?
- There's a fly.

466
00:26:45,542 --> 00:26:47,583
Let's not hurt God's creations.

467
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:50,500
And never a woman.

468
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:54,458
Uh, I'm sorry.

469
00:27:09,542 --> 00:27:11,417
Where are you going this late?

470
00:27:12,792 --> 00:27:13,832
I'm going home.

471
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:16,125
I don't want to bother
you by staying here long.

472
00:27:16,292 --> 00:27:17,874
Can't you leave tomorrow?

473
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:18,417
I guess not.

474
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,500
Thank you.

475
00:27:20,833 --> 00:27:24,000
For the clothes and
for letting me stay here.

476
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,999
By the way, that friend
of yours who came by.

477
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,791
His name...

478
00:27:30,792 --> 00:27:31,792
Zul.

479
00:27:32,292 --> 00:27:33,208
Yeah.

480
00:27:33,917 --> 00:27:36,333
Is he always that weird?

481
00:27:37,417 --> 00:27:39,083
Zul isn't weird.

482
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:42,083
He's just different.

483
00:27:43,583 --> 00:27:46,374
Brother Zul is our village's savior.

484
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:48,375
We call him Ashiap Man.

485
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,917
And he can lift...

486
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:53,124
Two water gallons all by himself.

487
00:27:53,125 --> 00:27:54,208
It's four gallons.

488
00:27:54,458 --> 00:27:56,375
I saw him lift seven gallons.

489
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:58,542
Where does he live?

490
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:00,000
That way.

491
00:28:00,792 --> 00:28:03,875
- That way.
- That way.

492
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,542
I'm heading back now, Sir.

493
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:06,583
Oh right.

494
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:08,292
- Take care.
- Yes.

495
00:28:15,958 --> 00:28:18,958
Zul, when you're done with your prayers,
go help your father at the market.

496
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,208
Yes, Mother.

497
00:28:24,292 --> 00:28:26,958
May peace be upon you. Excuse me.

498
00:28:27,542 --> 00:28:29,000
And upon you as well.

499
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:32,958
Kiara?

500
00:28:41,792 --> 00:28:43,417
Please protect this village.

501
00:28:43,542 --> 00:28:46,750
I have a feeling, something
bad might happen here.

502
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,792
Fire!

503
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,833
Fire!

504
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:10,083
- Sir, there's fire!
- Huh? Fire?

505
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:15,750
Sir, where's the fire?

506
00:29:16,917 --> 00:29:18,541
Fire!

507
00:29:18,542 --> 00:29:20,458
Zul, the market's on fire!

508
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,458
The market's on fire?

509
00:29:22,458 --> 00:29:23,875
Mother, the market's on fire!

510
00:29:25,583 --> 00:29:27,208
Fire!

511
00:29:34,958 --> 00:29:35,875
Fire!

512
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:37,833
Fire!

513
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,500
- Fire!
- Help!

514
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:56,958
Who sent you, huh?

515
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:09,792
Help!

516
00:30:12,458 --> 00:30:13,875
Where's my father?

517
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:22,292
Help, fire!

518
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:32,667
Come, Ma'am.

519
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:34,208
Help!

520
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:36,458
Help!

521
00:30:38,292 --> 00:30:41,125
- Help!
- That's my husband.

522
00:30:49,292 --> 00:30:51,499
Please help my husband!

523
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,667
Help!

524
00:30:52,875 --> 00:30:53,583
Father!

525
00:30:54,667 --> 00:30:55,625
Father!

526
00:30:56,208 --> 00:30:56,875
Zul!

527
00:30:59,542 --> 00:31:00,583
Goodness.

528
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,542
Father!

529
00:31:09,292 --> 00:31:10,417
Help!

530
00:31:12,292 --> 00:31:13,917
Help!

531
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:15,792
Father!

532
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:17,958
Father!

533
00:31:24,167 --> 00:31:25,792
Help!

534
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:27,208
Father!

535
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:32,208
Father!

536
00:31:34,708 --> 00:31:35,667
Father!

537
00:31:37,917 --> 00:31:38,667
Father!

538
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:41,458
Father!

539
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:48,708
Dear Allah!

540
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:01,292
Zul!

541
00:32:06,208 --> 00:32:08,083
Zul!

542
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,667
- Zul.
- Ma'am, it's your husband.

543
00:32:14,542 --> 00:32:15,417
Honey?

544
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:17,042
- Honey!
- Dear Allah!

545
00:32:22,292 --> 00:32:23,125
Honey?

546
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,333
- Father?
- Dear Allah! Honey!

547
00:32:46,458 --> 00:32:47,667
Take care of Zul.

548
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:52,583
I'm here, Father.

549
00:33:03,375 --> 00:33:04,417
Father!

550
00:33:04,875 --> 00:33:06,417
Honey!

551
00:33:10,292 --> 00:33:12,292
Father!

552
00:33:26,583 --> 00:33:28,375
Father!

553
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:05,792
Be strong.

554
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:20,292
Zul.

555
00:34:23,375 --> 00:34:25,167
Let your father go, Zul.

556
00:34:27,167 --> 00:34:29,458
He's resting in peace with Allah.

557
00:34:30,292 --> 00:34:31,958
You have to prove to him.

558
00:34:32,167 --> 00:34:35,000
That you can be useful to others.

559
00:34:36,458 --> 00:34:38,292
Make your father proud, Zul.

560
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:22,375
Well.

561
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:24,875
Soon.

562
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:26,792
Everyone of you...

563
00:35:27,833 --> 00:35:29,500
...will live at Gersang Land.

564
00:35:37,708 --> 00:35:38,500
Nico.

565
00:35:41,583 --> 00:35:42,667
Hi, Baby.

566
00:35:47,042 --> 00:35:47,833
Take a look.

567
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:50,750
Excuse me, Sir.

568
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:54,750
I found this at the
burned down marketplace.

569
00:35:54,792 --> 00:35:59,250
Coincidentally, it's right at the area that
you're trying to develop as elite housing.

570
00:35:59,333 --> 00:36:02,667
I don't like the way you do your business
that always sacrifices poor people.

571
00:36:02,792 --> 00:36:04,042
It's their own fault.

572
00:36:04,083 --> 00:36:07,083
Why did they have to rent houses
at the riverbank?

573
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:08,833
Use your brain!

574
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,667
Do you think they want to live there?

575
00:36:10,875 --> 00:36:13,667
You think they all have
rich family, like you?

576
00:36:15,167 --> 00:36:17,583
Have you ever heard a saying?

577
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:21,875
Fellow rich people
shouldn't hurt each other.

578
00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:27,250
I will tell my dad about this.

579
00:36:27,458 --> 00:36:28,957
I will expose everything!

580
00:36:28,958 --> 00:36:30,250
Be my guest, Kiara.

581
00:36:31,042 --> 00:36:33,333
Because you'll need more evidence.

582
00:36:33,667 --> 00:36:35,083
Than just a lighter.

583
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:38,292
I regret I ever had a boyfriend like you!

584
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,958
If you're upset at your ex...

585
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:47,042
...it means you still have
feelings for him, Kiara.

586
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,167
DP Man.

587
00:36:57,458 --> 00:37:00,083
Make sure the development of that village
goes according to plan.

588
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:03,292
As you can see.

589
00:37:04,167 --> 00:37:05,292
I'm not playing games.

590
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:08,333
This is what you get if
you don't pay the rent.

591
00:37:08,375 --> 00:37:11,875
How can we pay?
We don't have any livelihood anymore.

592
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,333
We're having a hard time.

593
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:15,375
Forget eating.
We don't even have anything to cook.

594
00:37:15,417 --> 00:37:19,125
True, Sir. My family and
I are taking turns fasting.

595
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:22,082
One day my wife fasts,
the next day's my turn.

596
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:24,792
The other day my wife
eats, and my child fasts.

597
00:37:25,083 --> 00:37:26,417
Please help, Sir.

598
00:37:26,458 --> 00:37:27,208
Shut up!

599
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:31,750
Sir, I'm begging you.

600
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,167
Don't destroy our house.

601
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:34,916
This is all we have.

602
00:37:34,917 --> 00:37:36,167
It's not yours!

603
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:38,500
You just rent.

604
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,542
And you haven't paid!

605
00:37:40,583 --> 00:37:42,167
Sister Aisyah!

606
00:37:42,792 --> 00:37:45,208
Don't be rude to a girl.

607
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,042
Sir, I'm begging you.

608
00:37:48,417 --> 00:37:49,750
Don't destroy it.

609
00:37:49,792 --> 00:37:51,332
Have mercy on these kids.

610
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:52,500
Take your kids with you!

611
00:37:52,542 --> 00:37:53,833
Please, Sir.

612
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:55,542
Don't destroy it.

613
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:56,625
Get out of here!

614
00:37:57,542 --> 00:37:58,125
Or else...

615
00:38:03,042 --> 00:38:04,250
It hurts, Bro!

616
00:38:08,667 --> 00:38:09,583
Are you alright?

617
00:38:12,667 --> 00:38:14,542
Good, someone has guts.

618
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,750
But courage is not enough!

619
00:38:16,792 --> 00:38:17,792
I need money.

620
00:38:18,958 --> 00:38:21,458
If you can't pay your rent...

621
00:38:21,667 --> 00:38:22,708
...leave this place.

622
00:38:22,917 --> 00:38:25,708
The rest can take our boss' generous offer.

623
00:38:25,917 --> 00:38:27,042
Sell your land.

624
00:38:27,083 --> 00:38:27,958
Don't worry.

625
00:38:28,583 --> 00:38:31,083
You can rent the apartment we will provide.

626
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:32,333
Special for you.

627
00:38:32,625 --> 00:38:34,708
Where can we get such
money? It's so expensive.

628
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,375
Yes, so expensive.

629
00:38:36,917 --> 00:38:41,333
Sir, how can we live in an apartment?
Please be reasonable.

630
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:42,458
That's not my business!

631
00:38:42,792 --> 00:38:44,250
In a few days...

632
00:38:44,292 --> 00:38:45,667
...I'll be back.

633
00:38:46,042 --> 00:38:48,916
Sir, won't you give us some lenience?

634
00:38:48,917 --> 00:38:51,708
Sister Aisyah!

635
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:11,708
Dad.

636
00:39:12,167 --> 00:39:14,208
Did you get the pictures I sent you?

637
00:39:14,833 --> 00:39:15,708
I did.

638
00:39:15,917 --> 00:39:17,917
And I'm very concerned about the incident.

639
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:19,417
Your concern is not enough.

640
00:39:19,583 --> 00:39:20,875
We have to help them, Dad.

641
00:39:23,292 --> 00:39:24,250
Kiara.

642
00:39:25,292 --> 00:39:27,292
Why do you still doubt me?

643
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:30,125
Today I coordinated things with my team.

644
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:33,375
And they've prepared essential groceries
for the fire victims.

645
00:39:33,667 --> 00:39:34,999
And what about the eviction?

646
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,667
Well.

647
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:39,292
That is also one of
the things I will fight for.

648
00:39:39,833 --> 00:39:41,708
If I get reelected.

649
00:39:44,042 --> 00:39:45,375
I'm proud of you.

650
00:39:45,667 --> 00:39:49,083
A daughter with a good
sense of social responsibility.

651
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:51,958
I believe in you.

652
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:55,750
Help your sisters tidy up, okay?

653
00:39:57,792 --> 00:39:59,917
Zul, Miss.

654
00:40:00,458 --> 00:40:01,292
Yes, Mr. Hans.

655
00:40:01,293 --> 00:40:04,999
I have a message from
the neighborhood chief.

656
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,333
Should we let the kids stay here
or at his house?

657
00:40:08,375 --> 00:40:10,207
They want to stay here, Sir.

658
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:11,208
With Zul.

659
00:40:11,833 --> 00:40:14,125
Yes, Sir. I asked them to stay indoors.

660
00:40:14,167 --> 00:40:15,417
But they refused.

661
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:16,708
We'll stay in this tent.

662
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,457
Yes, camping with Ashiap Man.

663
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:21,082
- Yes, with Ashiap Man.
- We'll stay here.

664
00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:23,082
Well, if anything happens...

665
00:40:23,083 --> 00:40:26,083
...once every 24 hours,
you can contact Mr. Hans.

666
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:27,500
Alright.

667
00:40:27,667 --> 00:40:28,500
Thank you, Sir.

668
00:40:28,501 --> 00:40:30,333
Okay then, I'll be going.

669
00:40:30,417 --> 00:40:31,292
Alright, Mr. Hans.

670
00:40:31,293 --> 00:40:33,250
- May peace be upon you.
- And upon you as well.

671
00:40:33,625 --> 00:40:35,792
- Let's clean up some more.
- Yes, Sis.

672
00:40:53,583 --> 00:40:55,875
It's a superhero cape.

673
00:40:56,125 --> 00:40:58,125
For my beloved son.

674
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:01,958
Why are you trying to burn it, Zul?

675
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,500
Father?

676
00:41:06,708 --> 00:41:08,250
I'm ready!

677
00:41:10,083 --> 00:41:11,375
I miss you.

678
00:41:11,667 --> 00:41:15,375
Why do you look so sad?

679
00:41:17,667 --> 00:41:19,083
I've failed, Father.

680
00:41:20,167 --> 00:41:21,708
I'm a useless kid.

681
00:41:22,208 --> 00:41:26,708
Zul, everybody in this
village needs your help.

682
00:41:29,375 --> 00:41:30,417
No, Father.

683
00:41:31,292 --> 00:41:32,792
I'm not a hero.

684
00:41:34,833 --> 00:41:36,250
I'm just an ordinary person.

685
00:41:36,958 --> 00:41:40,042
All heroes are ordinary people, Zul.

686
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:44,333
And ordinary people can be heroes.

687
00:41:49,458 --> 00:41:51,250
Follow your conscience, Son.

688
00:41:52,583 --> 00:41:54,625
Your conscience is always right.

689
00:41:56,333 --> 00:41:57,292
Zul.

690
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,292
Aisyah.

691
00:42:01,125 --> 00:42:02,375
Can't sleep?

692
00:42:12,292 --> 00:42:13,375
I'm sorry, Aisyah.

693
00:42:13,792 --> 00:42:15,375
I couldn't help you.

694
00:42:15,417 --> 00:42:17,125
It wasn't your fault, Zul.

695
00:42:20,167 --> 00:42:22,458
Taking care of the children is not easy.

696
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:27,208
But I try to hold on.

697
00:42:27,958 --> 00:42:29,958
I want them to have a future.

698
00:42:30,792 --> 00:42:32,375
But it's my fault, Aisyah.

699
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:35,250
Zul.

700
00:42:36,292 --> 00:42:39,250
Even staying in a tent, I'm grateful.

701
00:42:42,792 --> 00:42:46,458
It's true that sometimes I feel desperate.

702
00:42:49,458 --> 00:42:52,000
I don't have the answer to all my problems.

703
00:42:52,125 --> 00:42:55,625
But I always rely on Allah.

704
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I'm sure you can help us, Zul.

705
00:43:03,625 --> 00:43:04,792
Are you sure?

706
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:07,792
Pray for me.

707
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:09,583
I will.

708
00:43:18,292 --> 00:43:21,167

709
00:43:24,208 --> 00:43:27,041
Relax, Zul. Jon and I will help you...

710
00:43:27,042 --> 00:43:29,375
...to be the hero of our village.

711
00:43:29,667 --> 00:43:31,249
That's right, Zul.

712
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:32,832
But from YouTube videos, Jon?

713
00:43:32,833 --> 00:43:36,167
Nowadays you can learn
anything from YouTube.

714
00:43:36,208 --> 00:43:37,916
True, look at this.

715
00:43:37,917 --> 00:43:39,667

Does it have circumcision tutorial, Jon?

720
00:43:51,083 --> 00:43:52,792
You haven't been circumcised, Zul?

721
00:43:54,542 --> 00:43:55,375
I have.

722
00:43:55,542 --> 00:43:57,375
Enough, focus.

A million?

Cheap, right?

Huh, what a dead end!

739
00:45:23,875 --> 00:45:26,708
Excuse me, would you
like to order more drinks?

740
00:45:28,708 --> 00:45:29,750
You got any promo, Ma'am?

741
00:45:29,917 --> 00:45:31,708
We do have some promotional offers.

742
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:33,750
Buy two coffees and you'll get one free.

743
00:45:33,792 --> 00:45:35,791
It suits the three of you.

744
00:45:35,792 --> 00:45:38,666
Also for the cakes, 30.000 each.

745
00:45:38,667 --> 00:45:41,208
If you buy two, you'll only pay 50.000.

746
00:45:41,417 --> 00:45:43,625
We also have this digital wallet promotion.

747
00:45:43,667 --> 00:45:45,541
You'll get a 30% cash back.

748
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:46,958
So which one will you take?

749
00:45:50,042 --> 00:45:52,333
No, thanks, Ma'am. We still have some.

750
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,458
Excuse us.

751
00:46:13,667 --> 00:46:14,625
What's going on?

752
00:46:15,833 --> 00:46:16,542
Hey!

753
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,542
Who stopped my car?

754
00:46:19,667 --> 00:46:20,875
Quite strong.

755
00:46:21,583 --> 00:46:22,958
But what was your purpose?

756
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:25,750
Mister, you almost hit a kid.

757
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,417
Kid, stop playing mobile games
on the street. It's dangerous.

758
00:46:29,583 --> 00:46:31,374
Whose playing games?

759
00:46:31,375 --> 00:46:33,250
I'm making a TikTok video.

760
00:46:37,625 --> 00:46:40,541
And what's a kid like you
doing outside all by yourself?

761
00:46:40,542 --> 00:46:43,916
Better to be alone than
going out together like you two.

762
00:46:43,917 --> 00:46:46,708
See, the devil is following you.

763
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:51,750
This insolent kid, always answering.

764
00:46:51,917 --> 00:46:53,792
Men, always hard to understand!

765
00:46:58,625 --> 00:46:59,375
Mister.

766
00:46:59,875 --> 00:47:02,417
Are you Mister Jamet? The famous YouTuber?

767
00:47:02,458 --> 00:47:04,291
Hi, you must be my fans.

768
00:47:04,292 --> 00:47:05,791
Ah, that's right.

769
00:47:05,792 --> 00:47:06,792
Did you subscribe to my channel?

770
00:47:06,833 --> 00:47:07,833
We have!

771
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:08,833
Mr. Jamet.

772
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,292
Please teach us how to
become heroes, Mr. Jamet.

773
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:15,333
Yes, Mister. But...

774
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:18,917
We don't have the money
for your "Meet and Greet".

775
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:24,124
Okay, since you saved that kid...

776
00:47:24,125 --> 00:47:26,458
...and saved me from
the trouble of hitting her...

777
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,083
...I will tell you the secret.

778
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:29,375
For free!

779
00:47:29,833 --> 00:47:30,833
No need to pay.

780
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:35,625
For real, Mister?

781
00:47:36,208 --> 00:47:37,083
Kuproy.

782
00:47:38,458 --> 00:47:39,292
My laptop.

783
00:47:45,375 --> 00:47:46,708
Here's my secret.

784
00:47:47,625 --> 00:47:48,792
Closer.

785
00:47:59,458 --> 00:48:00,542
Awesome!

786
00:48:00,875 --> 00:48:02,750
This guy is self-taught.

787
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:04,042
Just from YouTube videos.

788
00:48:04,043 --> 00:48:06,250
See, what did I told you?

789
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:09,000
So Mr. Jamet is not really strong?

790
00:48:10,083 --> 00:48:11,500
So you're not a hero?

791
00:48:13,542 --> 00:48:15,917
I'm strong, I'm a hero.

792
00:48:16,792 --> 00:48:18,792
A hero through editing, animation.

793
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:21,292
I want to learn.

794
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:23,875
- You want to be superheroes?
- We do, Mister.

795
00:48:24,042 --> 00:48:24,792
Come here.

796
00:48:26,542 --> 00:48:29,042
"We are the heroes of our own story."

797
00:48:29,375 --> 00:48:30,458
Which means?

798
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,292
We are the heroes.

799
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:34,542
Of our own story.

800
00:48:36,458 --> 00:48:38,249
Did you hear that? I'm positively sure.

801
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:41,166
We can make a great video about Ashiap Man!

802
00:48:41,167 --> 00:48:42,167
That's right!

803
00:48:42,168 --> 00:48:44,166
Relax, Zul, we'll make a great video.

804
00:48:44,167 --> 00:48:45,916
Mister, thank you!

805
00:48:45,917 --> 00:48:47,083
Mister, thank you so much!

806
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:49,750
Come on, Zul. Let's make one.

807
00:48:50,583 --> 00:48:53,249
Reach far up, then you go down.

808
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:55,832
Keep your spirit up.
Try to look like a hero.

809
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:56,708
Okay.

810
00:48:56,875 --> 00:48:57,708
Roll.

811
00:48:57,750 --> 00:48:58,875
Let's check some references.

812
00:48:59,417 --> 00:49:00,874
Three, two, one.

813
00:49:00,875 --> 00:49:02,042
Action!

814
00:49:02,917 --> 00:49:05,500
Zul...
And then like this.

815
00:49:11,333 --> 00:49:13,250
Now, let's take a look.

816
00:49:13,792 --> 00:49:15,375
But this looks like it's too much.

817
00:49:15,625 --> 00:49:18,582
What do you mean too much?
No, this is just acting. It's great.

818
00:49:18,583 --> 00:49:20,292
It's just for YouTube.

819
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,041
Jon, you're great!

820
00:49:28,042 --> 00:49:29,999
Good job.

821
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,333
But this is just editing.

822
00:49:31,875 --> 00:49:33,417
It's alright.

823
00:49:33,458 --> 00:49:36,958
What's important is that you look cool.
You got that, Zul?

824
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:40,833
Ashiap Man's first video, ready to upload.

825
00:49:41,708 --> 00:49:43,457
We're stealing WiFi, don't be so loud!

826
00:49:43,458 --> 00:49:44,583
Oh, right.

827
00:49:46,708 --> 00:49:48,000
100 percent!

828
00:49:49,208 --> 00:49:51,375
We'll be famous, Zul.

829
00:49:51,417 --> 00:49:54,208
- We'll go viral!
- Amen!

830
00:49:56,125 --> 00:49:58,750
Hey, what are you doing here?

831
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:01,708
Goodness, you're stealing WiFi?

832
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:03,875
Sorry, Ma'am. We're done.

833
00:50:04,458 --> 00:50:06,750
Yes, we're sorry, Ma'am. Just a bit more.

834
00:50:06,792 --> 00:50:09,375
"Ma'am"?! You think I'm your mother?

835
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:11,582
Forget about being your mother.

836
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:13,708
I don't even wanna be your mother-in-law.

837
00:50:13,792 --> 00:50:17,292
God forbid my daughter has
a penniless boyfriend like you.

838
00:50:17,458 --> 00:50:19,333
Yes, Ma'am. Relax.

839
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:20,875
I already have a future bride.

840
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:23,583
Not my daughter, right?

841
00:50:23,917 --> 00:50:25,250
I don't know, Ma'am.

842
00:50:25,292 --> 00:50:26,917
I've never met her mother.

843
00:50:27,208 --> 00:50:28,875
Just leave, be gone!

844
00:50:29,125 --> 00:50:31,083
And don't come back!

845
00:50:31,208 --> 00:50:33,042
I'll change the WiFi password!

846
00:50:40,208 --> 00:50:42,125
Hello, Earth citizens.

847
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:45,166
Good news for all of us.

848
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:48,167
The news about our misfortune
has reached Mr. Dwi Rupa.

849
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:51,708
He sent these groceries for all of us.

850
00:50:51,875 --> 00:50:54,124
Awesome, right?
Come grab them. Don't be shy.

851
00:50:54,125 --> 00:50:56,833
Hey, this is called "money politic".

852
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,333
This is not right.

853
00:50:58,708 --> 00:51:00,458
- This is not right.
- Hey, Lady.

854
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:01,958
Mind your words.

855
00:51:02,375 --> 00:51:05,041
These are groceries, not politics.
Take a look.

856
00:51:05,042 --> 00:51:06,750
Hey, Man. We don't need groceries.

857
00:51:06,792 --> 00:51:08,082
We need money. Right, Ma'am?

858
00:51:08,083 --> 00:51:10,167
- That's right!
- To pay our rent.

859
00:51:10,542 --> 00:51:12,416
We also need assurances.

860
00:51:12,417 --> 00:51:14,708
That we won't be evicted.

861
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:18,457
We need someone who
can guarantee our lives here.

862
00:51:18,458 --> 00:51:19,458
That's right!

863
00:51:19,459 --> 00:51:22,875
We don't need congressmen who makes
a lot of promises, without any assurances.

864
00:51:23,083 --> 00:51:25,083
True, it's a habit.

865
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:27,958
When they need votes, they come to us.

866
00:51:28,167 --> 00:51:29,583
You all just take it slow.

867
00:51:29,625 --> 00:51:31,999
That's his picture, and
these groceries are for you.

868
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,667
I'm this close to Mr. Dwi Rupa.

869
00:51:33,708 --> 00:51:36,124
I will talk to Mr. Dwi Rupa...

870
00:51:36,125 --> 00:51:38,458
Let Ashiap Man defend us!

871
00:51:39,167 --> 00:51:41,500
That's right!

872
00:51:41,583 --> 00:51:42,708
Yeah, you're useless.

873
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:43,500
Hey!

874
00:51:46,667 --> 00:51:48,333
You're quite loud.

875
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,708
Even my dad never yells at me.

876
00:51:50,875 --> 00:51:52,167
I'll bite your left ear.

877
00:51:52,208 --> 00:51:53,708
Hey, you're threatening a kid?

878
00:51:56,417 --> 00:51:58,332
I'll let you know, Ashiap Man is...

879
00:51:58,333 --> 00:51:59,083
Cool!

880
00:51:59,333 --> 00:52:01,333
Ladies and gentlemen, check you phones.

881
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,625
HE'S COOL!

882
00:52:11,875 --> 00:52:13,250
HE'S FAST!

883
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:16,292
HE'S STRONG!

884
00:52:18,125 --> 00:52:20,292
Hey, a thief! He's so ugly!

885
00:52:20,708 --> 00:52:22,457
Guys, that thief is so ugly.

886
00:52:22,458 --> 00:52:23,667
I'm scared, I'm a girl!

887
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:26,167
What to do, guys? I'm so scared!

888
00:52:30,333 --> 00:52:31,874
Honey, look at this.

889
00:52:31,875 --> 00:52:34,292
This video got a lot of viewers.

890
00:52:34,333 --> 00:52:36,708
What is this, a
clarification podcast? Or...

891
00:52:37,208 --> 00:52:39,125
Oh, a hobo prank.

892
00:52:39,292 --> 00:52:40,500
No!

893
00:52:40,792 --> 00:52:42,458
He's a superhero.

894
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,042
Like the movie Rafathar back then.

895
00:52:44,792 --> 00:52:46,250
Ashiap Man.

896
00:52:46,292 --> 00:52:48,458
He does look like a superhero. But...

897
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:50,250
He looks like a hillbilly.

898
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
He could be a famous YouTuber.

899
00:52:54,583 --> 00:52:55,375
You're right.

900
00:52:55,376 --> 00:52:58,500
But nowadays, you shouldn't
make superhero content.

901
00:52:58,625 --> 00:53:00,083
We should make simp content.

902
00:53:00,208 --> 00:53:03,625
Like that Gen Halilintar kid who's in
relationship with that Hermansyah girl.

903
00:53:03,667 --> 00:53:04,708
Hah, what a simp.

904
00:53:04,875 --> 00:53:06,500
Housewives throughout
Indonesia love that stuff.

905
00:53:06,542 --> 00:53:08,833
- So adorable.
- They're getting married in GBK Stadium!

906
00:53:24,417 --> 00:53:26,082
So handsome.

907
00:53:26,083 --> 00:53:27,458
What's your name?

908
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:28,333
Ashiap Man.

909
00:53:28,334 --> 00:53:29,625
I'm ready!

910
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:34,708
Guys, Ashiap Man really do help people.

911
00:53:35,708 --> 00:53:37,958
I want to be Ashiap Man's fan now.

912
00:53:41,167 --> 00:53:41,833
Yes!

913
00:53:42,417 --> 00:53:44,083
The village folks trust Ashiap Man.

914
00:53:46,833 --> 00:53:49,583
Pfft. Who would trust Ashiap Man?

915
00:53:49,625 --> 00:53:50,625
You guys are fools.

916
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:54,332
Ashiap Man is here,
everything's under control!

917
00:53:54,333 --> 00:53:55,667
Under control!

918
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,708
Return these groceries.

919
00:53:57,750 --> 00:53:58,750
Break it up!

920
00:53:59,333 --> 00:54:00,667
But I accepted the money!

921
00:54:00,708 --> 00:54:01,833
Ashiap Man has tricked you!

922
00:54:01,917 --> 00:54:03,583
Mr. Dwi Rupa is your true savior!

923
00:54:03,625 --> 00:54:05,333
Ashiap Man tricked you, hey!

924
00:54:05,792 --> 00:54:07,333
Where are the rice sacks?

925
00:54:07,542 --> 00:54:08,667
Are you hungry?

926
00:54:13,042 --> 00:54:15,000
Zul, Jon, look!

927
00:54:17,083 --> 00:54:18,500
It's trending number one!

928
00:54:18,958 --> 00:54:21,542
6,5 million viewers!

929
00:54:21,583 --> 00:54:24,041
We have gone viral!

930
00:54:24,042 --> 00:54:26,750
Yes! Viral, viral!

931
00:54:27,125 --> 00:54:28,458
I only get this much?

932
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:32,833
I shouldn't have acted so natural.

933
00:54:32,875 --> 00:54:34,042
Just take it.

934
00:54:34,542 --> 00:54:35,667
Don't tell anyone, okay?

935
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,250
You're quite handsome in person.

936
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:45,500
We have to make
something new! Think, quick!

937
00:54:45,833 --> 00:54:48,708
How about a scene where Ashiap Man
is chased by a komodo.

938
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:50,374
But when Ashiap Man stares at it...

939
00:54:50,375 --> 00:54:52,374
...the komodo turns into a gecko.

940
00:54:52,375 --> 00:54:53,375
Awesome.

941
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:02,167
What?

942
00:55:03,583 --> 00:55:04,875
Your hair...

943
00:55:08,792 --> 00:55:10,125
Goat!

944
00:55:15,667 --> 00:55:16,458
Morning, Andy.

945
00:55:17,292 --> 00:55:19,167
- Morning, Honey.
- Morning, Hon.

946
00:55:25,292 --> 00:55:26,832
So serious, what are you watching?

947
00:55:26,833 --> 00:55:29,791
It's a viral video on YouTube.

948
00:55:29,792 --> 00:55:33,083
He's been watching it since yesterday.

949
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,583
Oh right, Hon.

950
00:55:34,625 --> 00:55:36,708
It's Andy's birthday soon.

951
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,208
Why don't you ask him
what he want as a present?

952
00:55:40,208 --> 00:55:41,083
Dear.

953
00:55:41,375 --> 00:55:43,000
What do you want from Daddy?

954
00:55:43,792 --> 00:55:45,625
Andy wants to see Ashiap Man.

955
00:55:45,792 --> 00:55:47,167
I'm ready!

956
00:55:47,583 --> 00:55:50,000
Well, just give it to him.

957
00:55:50,125 --> 00:55:51,957
Let's arrange a party at home.

958
00:55:51,958 --> 00:55:53,458
Call our close friends.

959
00:55:56,625 --> 00:55:57,625
Let's eat.

960
00:55:57,625 --> 00:55:58,500
Where's Nico?

961
00:55:59,583 --> 00:56:00,542
I don't know.

962
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:07,333
Some villagers are resisting
the land purchase.

963
00:56:07,625 --> 00:56:08,750
But don't worry, Sir.

964
00:56:09,458 --> 00:56:10,875
I'll take care of it soon.

965
00:56:11,083 --> 00:56:13,042
How long do I have to wait?

966
00:56:13,375 --> 00:56:16,708
I told you to get everything done!

967
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:20,000
Now what's the problem?

968
00:56:20,042 --> 00:56:23,667
From the report, that
one person resisting is...

969
00:56:24,417 --> 00:56:25,625
Ashiap Man.

970
00:56:27,458 --> 00:56:29,167
- Who?
- Ashiap Man.

971
00:56:35,833 --> 00:56:37,833
Nico, do you know?

972
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:39,875
The one called...

973
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:41,250
Ashiap Man?

974
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:48,667
Good then.

975
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:53,083
You find that guy and
invite him to our house.

976
00:56:53,417 --> 00:56:57,167
He will entertain at your
brother Andy's birthday party.

977
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,500
I don't think we should invite him.

978
00:56:59,667 --> 00:57:01,874
Besides, you know I'm busy
dealing with the village folks...

979
00:57:01,875 --> 00:57:04,333
Why haven't you taken
care of that matter yet, Nico?

980
00:57:04,667 --> 00:57:05,500
Why?

981
00:57:07,125 --> 00:57:08,500
Can you do your work?

982
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:11,083
You told me yourself.

983
00:57:11,875 --> 00:57:15,542
That you will proof yourself
by acquiring that land.

984
00:57:18,125 --> 00:57:19,042
So can you?

985
00:57:19,583 --> 00:57:20,375
I can do it, Dad.

986
00:57:21,792 --> 00:57:22,583
Okay.

987
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:33,083
Zul?

988
00:57:33,625 --> 00:57:34,542
Yes, Mother?

989
00:57:35,458 --> 00:57:37,417
Why's your hair like that?

990
00:57:38,833 --> 00:57:42,042
Since you were a kid, I've
tried many kinds of shampoo.

991
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:45,417
But none can straighten
your hair like that.

992
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:50,417
I even tried to cut it, but didn't work.

993
00:58:03,458 --> 00:58:05,250
Goodness.

994
00:58:05,792 --> 00:58:06,958
So hard.

995
00:58:09,625 --> 00:58:10,958
What happened, Son?

996
00:58:12,042 --> 00:58:13,875
You can tell me.

997
00:58:14,708 --> 00:58:15,792
Zul lied, Mother.

998
00:58:18,333 --> 00:58:20,625
People think that I'm a superhero.

999
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:23,375
It's just a hoax, Mother.

1000
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:25,000
It's not true.

1001
00:58:26,542 --> 00:58:29,374
Zul, since your video came out...

1002
00:58:29,375 --> 00:58:32,375
...the village folks have
become high spirited.

1003
00:58:33,375 --> 00:58:35,750
You can't help them with materials.

1004
00:58:35,875 --> 00:58:39,458
But I see that you can
bring back their smile.

1005
00:58:42,542 --> 00:58:44,292
May peace be upon you.

1006
00:58:44,792 --> 00:58:46,042
And upon you as well.

1007
00:58:53,125 --> 00:58:54,625
This is for me, Kiara?

1008
00:58:55,958 --> 00:58:57,958
- What's inside?
- A surprise.

1009
00:58:58,583 --> 00:58:59,667
Open it later, okay?

1010
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:02,208
Thanks, Kiara.

1011
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:04,500
By the way, Zul...

1012
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:07,125
What's with your hair?

1013
00:59:11,792 --> 00:59:12,958
I made a video.

1014
00:59:14,542 --> 00:59:16,124
Everyone liked it.

1015
00:59:16,125 --> 00:59:18,792
Oh, that video where you become Ashiap Man?

1016
00:59:19,125 --> 00:59:20,542
I watched it.

1017
00:59:21,292 --> 00:59:22,750
It was cool. I liked it too.

1018
00:59:23,792 --> 00:59:25,292
I'm ready.

1019
00:59:29,583 --> 00:59:31,292
But that's all not true, Kiara.

1020
00:59:32,417 --> 00:59:33,667
The video was a lie.

1021
00:59:34,375 --> 00:59:36,083
I'm not really that strong.

1022
00:59:37,333 --> 00:59:38,333
I think...

1023
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:40,750
...being strong is a matter of perception.

1024
00:59:41,375 --> 00:59:44,500
Whoever helps people,
is surely stronger...

1025
00:59:44,583 --> 00:59:46,042
...than those who need help.

1026
00:59:47,708 --> 00:59:49,333
I can't help the villagers.

1027
00:59:51,542 --> 00:59:53,333
I can't help Aisyah.

1028
00:59:54,417 --> 00:59:57,667
I can't help the orphans.

1029
00:59:58,208 --> 00:59:59,875
And I couldn't save Father.

1030
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,917
When I first came to this village...

1031
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:11,000
...people called you a hero.

1032
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,792
If you could help people back then...

1033
01:00:14,208 --> 01:00:16,417
...I'm sure you can do it again now.

1034
01:00:17,458 --> 01:00:20,167
What's important is that with you around...

1035
01:00:20,875 --> 01:00:22,792
...they all have hope, Zul.

1036
01:00:23,083 --> 01:00:25,667
There! She's right, Zul.

1037
01:00:25,833 --> 01:00:28,832
Zul, here. A man came.

1038
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:30,542
A mysterious guy came to me.

1039
01:00:30,917 --> 01:00:32,000
He gave me these.

1040
01:00:32,042 --> 01:00:33,750
- An invitation.
- Also...

1041
01:00:39,583 --> 01:00:42,374
Zul, he said this is just the down payment.

1042
01:00:42,375 --> 01:00:45,750
He'll give you more if Ashiap
Man agrees to entertain...

1043
01:00:45,792 --> 01:00:47,792
...at some rich folks' house.

1044
01:00:48,083 --> 01:00:50,750
You could use the money, Zul. To...

1045
01:00:51,083 --> 01:00:53,042
To pay the villagers' rent.

1046
01:00:54,625 --> 01:00:55,958
Exactly, Zul.

1047
01:00:58,042 --> 01:00:59,875
Zul, you didn't lie.

1048
01:01:00,542 --> 01:01:02,375
You just need to be yourself.

1049
01:01:02,875 --> 01:01:04,208
Be Ashiap Man.

1050
01:01:04,875 --> 01:01:06,542
I'm sure you can be a hero.

1051
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:12,708
Zul, your hair!

1052
01:01:17,708 --> 01:01:19,333
Let's go, I'm ready.

1053
01:01:19,875 --> 01:01:21,708
I'm ready!

1054
01:01:23,417 --> 01:01:24,542
That's more like it.

1055
01:01:54,542 --> 01:01:57,042
Ashiap Man!

1056
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:31,750
Come on. Ashiap Man!

1057
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:54,208
Damn girlfriend!

1058
01:04:00,375 --> 01:04:01,458
What's wrong with you?

1059
01:04:02,583 --> 01:04:03,458
Did you use your brain?

1060
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:07,625
What would happen if those files
from my computer are exposed?

1061
01:04:07,792 --> 01:04:09,042
Did you even think?

1062
01:04:09,625 --> 01:04:11,624
Dad, I'll take it back from Kiara.

1063
01:04:11,625 --> 01:04:14,792
I told you to approach her, be nice to her.

1064
01:04:14,917 --> 01:04:17,458
Not break up with her!
Now everything's messed up!

1065
01:04:17,708 --> 01:04:18,542
Listen, Nico.

1066
01:04:19,125 --> 01:04:22,417
Don't let everything that I have built...

1067
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:24,625
...be destroyed just because of you!

1068
01:04:25,333 --> 01:04:27,125
Give me another chance.

1069
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
I promise.

1070
01:04:29,792 --> 01:04:31,750
I will take care of everything.

1071
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:35,875
Not once have you ever made me proud.

1072
01:04:46,083 --> 01:04:50,208
Dad, I've gathered all the evidence
that I promised you.

1073
01:04:51,708 --> 01:04:55,125
Everything in this flash disk
could destroy Gersang Corp.

1074
01:04:55,625 --> 01:04:58,375
I won't let you interfere
further with my business!

1075
01:04:58,583 --> 01:05:01,958
Just because you want to
play hero for the commoners.

1076
01:05:02,583 --> 01:05:05,750
Do you think I can have all this...

1077
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:07,750
...without anyone helping me?

1078
01:05:08,625 --> 01:05:10,500
I receive supports from many people!

1079
01:05:10,875 --> 01:05:12,542
Especially Gersang Corp.

1080
01:05:13,458 --> 01:05:15,458
You promised to help the citizens!

1081
01:05:16,458 --> 01:05:17,458
Citizens.

1082
01:05:17,792 --> 01:05:18,667
Kiara.

1083
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:20,875
I'm a citizen too.

1084
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:24,708
Mr. Gersang, Nico, they're also citizens.

1085
01:05:25,375 --> 01:05:27,667
Would I be able to give all this to you...

1086
01:05:27,708 --> 01:05:30,083
...If I hadn't been nice to their company?

1087
01:05:33,042 --> 01:05:34,333
I don't need all this.

1088
01:05:34,792 --> 01:05:37,833
No matter what, I will find more evidence
and upload it to the social media!

1089
01:05:37,875 --> 01:05:39,792
Okay, fine!

1090
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:43,958
Look.

1091
01:05:50,458 --> 01:05:52,792
I've been watching all your moves.

1092
01:05:53,125 --> 01:05:54,833
If you try to do anything...

1093
01:05:56,500 --> 01:06:00,167
...your hillbilly friend will be done for.

1094
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:02,333
And I'm sure.

1095
01:06:03,625 --> 01:06:06,500
His catfish stand cape won't be able
to protect him from hot bullets.

1096
01:06:08,667 --> 01:06:11,708
Here, I found this while collecting trash.

1097
01:06:13,208 --> 01:06:14,292
This is nice, Bro.

1098
01:06:14,333 --> 01:06:16,792
Still in good condition, Zul.
You can use it.

1099
01:06:16,958 --> 01:06:18,208
- Thanks, Bro.
- Yeah.

1100
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,250
- Hey, Zul!
- Zul!

1101
01:06:20,667 --> 01:06:23,332
Have you got no brain?
Where's your conscience?

1102
01:06:23,333 --> 01:06:26,167
How could you sell us out
for your personal gain?

1103
01:06:26,792 --> 01:06:29,167
Traitor! Fake!

1104
01:06:30,708 --> 01:06:32,083
Hey, why are you shouting
in front of my house?

1105
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:33,542
- What house?
- This!

1106
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:35,249
- This is your house?
- Yes!

1107
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:37,458
One spit on your house
and it will break down!

1108
01:06:38,042 --> 01:06:40,500
Give it up, we already saw Zul's video.

1109
01:06:40,750 --> 01:06:42,041
- True!
- That's enough proof!

1110
01:06:42,042 --> 01:06:44,625
Hey, you're a hobo. You know nothing.

1111
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:47,500
This is technological stuff.
You don't even have a cellphone.

1112
01:06:47,667 --> 01:06:49,625
I bet all you have is a
yellow screen phone.

1113
01:06:50,375 --> 01:06:52,082
True, I don't have a cellphone.

1114
01:06:52,083 --> 01:06:53,250
But I have a lot of garbage!

1115
01:06:57,583 --> 01:06:58,583
You listen.

1116
01:06:58,958 --> 01:07:01,417
Your house will be demolished soon too!

1117
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:10,667
Thank you.

1118
01:07:11,083 --> 01:07:12,749
It's nothing, Sir.

1119
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:14,042
Thank you for the payment.

1120
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:17,667
Just relax, trust me.

1121
01:07:17,792 --> 01:07:22,208
I will get rid of those insolent villagers.

1122
01:07:22,333 --> 01:07:24,000
Zul, you got hoax-ed!

1123
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:27,083
How did it get so complicated?

1124
01:07:27,792 --> 01:07:31,042
All I know is that we can't hope...

1125
01:07:31,875 --> 01:07:34,417
...for others to treat us kindly.

1126
01:07:34,667 --> 01:07:38,167
But we must always be kind to others.

1127
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:41,917
I'm sure Kiara can explain to the people
that Zul is innocent.

1128
01:07:51,542 --> 01:07:53,042
- What is it?
- Zul.

1129
01:07:53,792 --> 01:07:55,042
You don't have to look...

1130
01:07:57,292 --> 01:08:00,375
CONGRESSMAN DAUGHTER, KIARA RUPA SOON TO
MARRY NICO GERSANG, CRAZY RICH INDONESIAN

1131
01:08:00,958 --> 01:08:03,125
I'm sorry Zul. Honestly I already know...

1132
01:08:03,167 --> 01:08:06,250
...that Kiara has a relationship with Nico.

1133
01:08:06,792 --> 01:08:11,417
But what I don't understand is,
why would Kiara defend our village?

1134
01:08:12,667 --> 01:08:14,333
We can't rely on others.

1135
01:08:14,708 --> 01:08:16,375
We have to help this village.

1136
01:08:16,542 --> 01:08:18,667
And I want to be the Ashiap
Man with real strength.

1137
01:08:18,833 --> 01:08:20,833
No editting, no tricks.

1138
01:08:20,875 --> 01:08:23,417
Zul, you don't have a superhero power.

1139
01:08:23,458 --> 01:08:26,750
Even if we don't have superhero powers,
we can still help this village.

1140
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,125
I'm sure we can.

1141
01:08:29,625 --> 01:08:30,791
Will you guys help me?

1142
01:08:30,792 --> 01:08:32,833
Of course.

1143
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:00,792
Frog!

1144
01:09:11,417 --> 01:09:12,417
Are we done yet?

1145
01:09:12,458 --> 01:09:14,500
You can do it, Zul.
Another 400.

1146
01:09:15,292 --> 01:09:17,833
- 399...
- I've done 1000!

1147
01:09:17,958 --> 01:09:19,042
No, a little more.

1148
01:09:21,458 --> 01:09:22,208
Jon!

1149
01:09:22,958 --> 01:09:23,958
Did you fart?

1150
01:09:24,958 --> 01:09:26,000
Yeah, Zul.

1151
01:09:26,917 --> 01:09:28,583
I let out a bit.

1152
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:30,917
What did you let out?

1153
01:09:32,792 --> 01:09:34,250
Just hold it, Zul.

1154
01:09:35,083 --> 01:09:37,083
Jon, something's wet!

1155
01:09:38,208 --> 01:09:40,292
Look at your exercise. So strong, Zul.

1156
01:09:40,542 --> 01:09:41,750
Something stinks!

1157
01:09:41,792 --> 01:09:44,249
Three more rounds around the village, Zul!

1158
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:46,083
You can do it, Zul!

1159
01:09:46,417 --> 01:09:48,417
Three more rounds!

1160
01:10:27,167 --> 01:10:27,875
Dad.

1161
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:30,500
- I'll be going now.
- Okay.

1162
01:10:30,708 --> 01:10:34,875
Your decision to get back with Nico
is correct.

1163
01:10:37,042 --> 01:10:40,542
You don't think that you can get away
with this forever, do you?

1164
01:10:40,875 --> 01:10:42,833
That's what I've been doing.

1165
01:10:43,417 --> 01:10:44,625
Always getting away with it.

1166
01:10:45,625 --> 01:10:46,750
Give it up, Kiara.

1167
01:10:46,958 --> 01:10:49,458
You're too young to understand all this.

1168
01:10:50,292 --> 01:10:53,000
Get going. Good luck with
your pre-wedding photo shoot.

1169
01:10:53,125 --> 01:10:53,833
Yes, Dad.

1170
01:11:00,417 --> 01:11:01,292
Hi.

1171
01:11:02,375 --> 01:11:03,292
Wow.

1172
01:11:04,167 --> 01:11:05,292
You're so beautiful.

1173
01:11:07,333 --> 01:11:09,958
I'll be the most stupid
creature in the world.

1174
01:11:10,167 --> 01:11:12,625
If I have to lose you for the second time.

1175
01:11:14,292 --> 01:11:15,042
Thanks.

1176
01:11:15,917 --> 01:11:16,958
Nico.

1177
01:11:17,375 --> 01:11:19,375
May I borrow your phone?

1178
01:11:20,333 --> 01:11:21,000
What for?

1179
01:11:21,001 --> 01:11:24,667
I'm trying to contact the Event Organizer
that handles our pre-wedding.

1180
01:11:24,708 --> 01:11:27,167
But I accidentally deleted the number.

1181
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:29,000
May I see your phone?

1182
01:11:29,333 --> 01:11:31,042
Yeah, sure.

1183
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:37,792
Thanks.

1184
01:11:40,583 --> 01:11:43,000
By the way, my dad called you.

1185
01:11:43,208 --> 01:11:45,250
You better see him, he's been waiting.

1186
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:48,167
You came all the way
here, you should see him.

1187
01:11:48,333 --> 01:11:50,958
Okay, I'll go inside and see your dad.

1188
01:11:51,167 --> 01:11:51,708
Yeah.

1189
01:12:05,958 --> 01:12:08,000
Kiara! Hey, Kiara!

1190
01:12:08,792 --> 01:12:09,625
Kiara!

1191
01:12:14,417 --> 01:12:15,250
Damn it!

1192
01:12:16,583 --> 01:12:18,416
- Bitter?
- Well, this is coffee.

1193
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:19,708
Good news!

1194
01:12:19,875 --> 01:12:22,917
Today we will evict
everyone in this village.

1195
01:12:26,375 --> 01:12:28,375
Hey, everybody get out!

1196
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:29,417
Take your stuff with you.

1197
01:12:29,458 --> 01:12:32,875
Hey, get out!

1198
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:45,958
Bro, calm down.

1199
01:12:46,125 --> 01:12:47,417
No need to get angry.

1200
01:12:47,625 --> 01:12:48,417
Here's your money.

1201
01:12:52,750 --> 01:12:53,875
I'm sincere.

1202
01:12:55,417 --> 01:12:56,250
But remember.

1203
01:12:56,792 --> 01:12:58,750
Stop bothering the village folks.

1204
01:12:58,792 --> 01:12:59,458
Not enough!

1205
01:12:59,917 --> 01:13:01,250
This much money doesn't mean a thing.

1206
01:13:01,292 --> 01:13:03,375
- That's a lot!
- You talk a lot.

1207
01:13:04,250 --> 01:13:05,500
You still have to leave.

1208
01:13:05,542 --> 01:13:08,125
This is our village.
We will not leave this village!

1209
01:13:09,875 --> 01:13:10,583
Get him!

1210
01:14:05,875 --> 01:14:07,208
You're finished, Zul.

1211
01:14:08,167 --> 01:14:10,292
That's what you get for acting so cool!

1212
01:14:10,958 --> 01:14:12,333
You're just an fake.

1213
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:14,042
This guy is the real deal.

1214
01:14:37,417 --> 01:14:39,708
Hit his Adam's apple! Make him swallow it!

1215
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:21,583
I'm with Ashiap Man!

1216
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:25,708
Ashiap Man!

1217
01:15:38,333 --> 01:15:40,667
I hope you all have health insurance.

1218
01:15:40,833 --> 01:15:43,333
Because you will end up in hospital!

1219
01:15:55,667 --> 01:15:57,208
Charge!

1220
01:16:20,583 --> 01:16:21,833
Where are you going?

1221
01:16:40,458 --> 01:16:42,000
Mercy!

1222
01:17:35,875 --> 01:17:37,667
The DP is paid in full.

1223
01:17:50,542 --> 01:17:54,083
We won!

1224
01:17:57,667 --> 01:17:58,958
We won!

1225
01:17:59,333 --> 01:18:01,000
We won!

1226
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:04,041
Our village won!

1227
01:18:04,042 --> 01:18:05,000
Zul!

1228
01:18:12,583 --> 01:18:13,500
Zul!

1229
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:17,166
You better not come here anymore.

1230
01:18:17,167 --> 01:18:19,917
How could you?
You made Zul care for you.

1231
01:18:20,125 --> 01:18:22,583
And you toyed with him
by marrying someone else?

1232
01:18:22,625 --> 01:18:23,957
Don't you know how much it hurts?

1233
01:18:23,958 --> 01:18:26,750
To love somebody who doesn't love you back?

1234
01:18:29,875 --> 01:18:33,667
I made people believe
that I'm marrying Nico.

1235
01:18:33,958 --> 01:18:35,958
So I can get his cellphone.

1236
01:18:36,375 --> 01:18:40,750
This phone holds all the information needed
to destroy Gersang Corp.

1237
01:18:40,792 --> 01:18:42,583
I'll just upload it to the social media.

1238
01:18:43,042 --> 01:18:44,333
But the problem is...

1239
01:18:44,708 --> 01:18:47,042
His phone is locked with a password.

1240
01:18:47,333 --> 01:18:49,167
And I don't know what the password is.

1241
01:18:52,875 --> 01:18:53,875
Nico!

1242
01:18:59,792 --> 01:19:00,750
Aisyah!

1243
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:03,667
I'm asking you, where's Ashiap Man?

1244
01:19:04,417 --> 01:19:05,500
Where is he?

1245
01:19:05,792 --> 01:19:07,166
Ashiap Man is heartbroken!

1246
01:19:07,167 --> 01:19:09,833
Tell Ashiap Man, stop acting like a hero.

1247
01:19:10,417 --> 01:19:11,125
Useless!

1248
01:19:12,042 --> 01:19:13,167
And for you, Kiara.

1249
01:19:13,458 --> 01:19:14,791
You will return my phone.

1250
01:19:14,792 --> 01:19:18,583
Because if I find you
stealing files from my phone...

1251
01:19:19,042 --> 01:19:20,333
Or if you upload them...

1252
01:19:24,792 --> 01:19:26,167
You know what this is, Kiara?

1253
01:19:26,333 --> 01:19:27,833
One click, Kiara.

1254
01:19:28,333 --> 01:19:29,875
They will all go to heaven.

1255
01:19:30,083 --> 01:19:30,917
Boom!

1256
01:19:33,708 --> 01:19:35,292
I will share the address to your phone.

1257
01:19:35,708 --> 01:19:37,167
You come here right now.

1258
01:19:38,167 --> 01:19:38,958
Okay.

1259
01:19:39,667 --> 01:19:40,750
I'll go there now.

1260
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:41,958
Wait.

1261
01:19:42,375 --> 01:19:43,833
Maybe this is a trap.

1262
01:19:44,458 --> 01:19:46,375
Then who will help them?

1263
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:47,542
I'm leaving now.

1264
01:19:49,583 --> 01:19:50,458
Wait!

1265
01:19:57,292 --> 01:19:58,500
You're an evil person!

1266
01:19:59,083 --> 01:20:01,542
Aren't you afraid of sinning?

1267
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:03,833
People like him are more afraid of poverty.

1268
01:20:15,542 --> 01:20:18,917
The other day, evidence against me...

1269
01:20:19,625 --> 01:20:21,417
...was destroyed by Dwi Rupa.

1270
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,917
But why do you have to mess up again, Nico?

1271
01:20:27,667 --> 01:20:28,542
I...

1272
01:20:29,708 --> 01:20:30,708
I was tricked, Dad.

1273
01:20:36,042 --> 01:20:38,583
Somebody has to take the blame for this.

1274
01:20:39,333 --> 01:20:40,458
It's time, Nico.

1275
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,292
For you to show your
loyalty to your parents.

1276
01:20:46,458 --> 01:20:47,458
Dad!

1277
01:20:51,833 --> 01:20:53,750
Dad!

1278
01:20:54,708 --> 01:20:56,292
You really are an incompetent kid!

1279
01:20:56,583 --> 01:20:57,250
Useless!

1280
01:20:58,292 --> 01:21:00,375
Sis Aisyah!

1281
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:07,625
- Dad!
- Sis Aisyah!

1282
01:21:09,542 --> 01:21:12,167
Dad, please open the door.

1283
01:21:12,792 --> 01:21:15,750
Tomorrow morning, there will be huge news.

1284
01:21:16,292 --> 01:21:18,542
"Nico, son of Mr. Gersang."

1285
01:21:19,125 --> 01:21:22,583
"Out of guilt decided to..."

1286
01:21:22,625 --> 01:21:25,292
"...blow himself up with the witnesses."

1287
01:21:27,375 --> 01:21:29,375
Dad, come on! Please, Dad!

1288
01:21:32,667 --> 01:21:36,375
Sir, please. Don't hurt the kids.

1289
01:21:38,875 --> 01:21:40,125
Take care of her, and remember.

1290
01:21:40,167 --> 01:21:42,250
Finish whoever dares to enter this place.

1291
01:21:49,833 --> 01:21:51,957
I'm going, you two stay here.

1292
01:21:51,958 --> 01:21:53,250
No, we're coming.

1293
01:21:53,292 --> 01:21:54,792
No, you two wait here.

1294
01:22:01,167 --> 01:22:01,875
Jon.

1295
01:22:02,583 --> 01:22:05,917
In action movies,
do they listen when told to wait?

1296
01:22:06,667 --> 01:22:08,458
- They do?
- No, Fool! Let's go!

1297
01:22:18,875 --> 01:22:21,125
- Jon, let's fight them 2 by 2.
- Okay.

1298
01:22:21,167 --> 01:22:22,874
- You take the big one, I'll take the medium one.
- Okay.

1299
01:22:22,875 --> 01:22:25,792
- Remember, strike before they're ready.
- I'm ready.

1300
01:22:25,833 --> 01:22:28,167
We have to strike their weaknesses, Jon!

1301
01:22:29,125 --> 01:22:30,874
- You got that?
- Got it.

1302
01:22:30,875 --> 01:22:32,083
Crush them!

1303
01:22:32,958 --> 01:22:35,417
No matter what, don't let go!

1304
01:22:35,667 --> 01:22:37,250
Don't let go.

1305
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:38,625
- Ready?
- Ready.

1306
01:22:38,667 --> 01:22:41,000
One, two...

1307
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:42,083
Three!

1308
01:22:45,625 --> 01:22:46,792
They're KO-ed.

1309
01:23:26,875 --> 01:23:29,125
Brother, now what?

1310
01:23:30,583 --> 01:23:31,833
We won't survive.

1311
01:23:53,292 --> 01:23:55,416
Sis Aisyah.

1312
01:23:55,417 --> 01:23:57,417
- Please help Sis Aisyah.
- Come with us.

1313
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:01,250
Sis Aisyah was taken away.

1314
01:24:08,125 --> 01:24:09,917
Slowly, careful.

1315
01:24:25,375 --> 01:24:26,958
Sis Aisyah!

1316
01:24:27,125 --> 01:24:29,042
You're right, it's Sis Aisyah!

1317
01:24:37,375 --> 01:24:38,542
You guys wait here.

1318
01:24:43,917 --> 01:24:44,833
Kiara!

1319
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:01,083
Superhuman serum.

1320
01:26:26,958 --> 01:26:28,083
How are you?

1321
01:26:29,125 --> 01:26:30,500
Future daughter-in-law?

1322
01:26:55,750 --> 01:26:57,999
Aisyah and the kids were kidnapped!

1323
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:58,750
Kidnapped?

1324
01:27:14,542 --> 01:27:16,833
This is for me, Kiara? What's inside?

1325
01:27:29,208 --> 01:27:30,708
Zul!

1326
01:27:31,167 --> 01:27:34,792
Ashiap Man!

1327
01:28:47,583 --> 01:28:49,000
Kiara, are you hurt?

1328
01:28:49,250 --> 01:28:50,916
It hurts, Zul!

1329
01:28:50,917 --> 01:28:52,917
Same here, I'm hurt too.

1330
01:28:58,125 --> 01:28:59,750
Fighting against a girl?

1331
01:28:59,917 --> 01:29:00,917
Come fight me!

1332
01:29:12,542 --> 01:29:13,250
Zul!

1333
01:29:29,042 --> 01:29:31,500
My son's idol...

1334
01:29:32,375 --> 01:29:33,708
...is nothing but a party clown!

1335
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,250
Not a hero!

1336
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:42,917
Where's Nico's phone? Give it to me!

1337
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:53,292
Sir, please don't resort to violence.

1338
01:29:53,417 --> 01:29:54,875
Sir, let's make peace.

1339
01:29:55,792 --> 01:29:58,167
Yes, Sir. Make peace.

1340
01:29:58,708 --> 01:30:00,124
Stop joking!

1341
01:30:00,125 --> 01:30:02,958
I'm not joking. This is all we got, Sir.

1342
01:30:07,625 --> 01:30:08,208
Stop.

1343
01:30:23,958 --> 01:30:25,291
We won't give you the phone.

1344
01:30:25,292 --> 01:30:26,292
What?

1345
01:30:28,167 --> 01:30:29,500
And we all...

1346
01:30:30,542 --> 01:30:32,332
...will uncover your crimes.

1347
01:30:32,333 --> 01:30:34,042
What did you say, Nico?!

1348
01:30:35,208 --> 01:30:36,125
Unlock my phone.

1349
01:30:37,708 --> 01:30:38,667
The password...

1350
01:30:39,083 --> 01:30:41,917
060872.

1351
01:30:46,042 --> 01:30:47,042
What number is that?

1352
01:30:47,792 --> 01:30:48,750
Your birthday?

1353
01:30:50,958 --> 01:30:52,208
That's my dad's birthday.

1354
01:30:53,958 --> 01:30:55,042
Which folder?

1355
01:30:56,167 --> 01:30:57,292
Inside the folder...

1356
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:02,000
"My Dad, My Hero."

1357
01:31:10,917 --> 01:31:14,542
For years I've been trying to be like you.

1358
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:17,667
And you're right.

1359
01:31:19,167 --> 01:31:20,667
I will never succeed.

1360
01:31:23,208 --> 01:31:27,125
I will never commit crimes like you do.

1361
01:31:28,167 --> 01:31:29,208
And now...

1362
01:31:29,708 --> 01:31:32,500
I'm determined to choose the right way.

1363
01:31:37,833 --> 01:31:38,750
Found it!

1364
01:31:39,042 --> 01:31:41,583
This is all evidence of
Gersang Corp's crimes!

1365
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,083
Uploading!

1366
01:31:55,125 --> 01:31:57,625
Zul, you can do it!

1367
01:32:06,083 --> 01:32:07,167
Nico!

1368
01:32:09,958 --> 01:32:11,042
Hey, Mr. Evil.

1369
01:32:14,458 --> 01:32:16,667
I'm ready!

1370
01:32:26,375 --> 01:32:29,792
Ashiap Man!

1371
01:32:46,125 --> 01:32:48,583
Everybody get out! Out!

1372
01:32:49,167 --> 01:32:50,083
Come on!

1373
01:32:50,792 --> 01:32:51,625
Hurry!

1374
01:33:02,750 --> 01:33:04,042
Hurry, Nico!

1375
01:33:09,708 --> 01:33:10,542
Kiara!

1376
01:33:11,042 --> 01:33:11,833
Hurry!

1377
01:33:12,125 --> 01:33:14,417
Zul, help Aisyah now!

1378
01:33:15,583 --> 01:33:16,583
Aisyah!

1379
01:33:16,625 --> 01:33:19,208
No, save Kiara now, Zul!

1380
01:33:21,458 --> 01:33:23,082
- Kiara, come on!
- Save Aisyah!

1381
01:33:23,083 --> 01:33:26,083
Hurry, Zul! Get Kiara out of here!

1382
01:33:26,750 --> 01:33:28,458
Zul, help Aisyah now!

1383
01:33:30,708 --> 01:33:33,250
Zul, help Kiara!

1384
01:33:33,542 --> 01:33:35,917
Zul, hurry and help Aisyah! Get her out!

1385
01:33:37,750 --> 01:33:39,749
Zul, hurry!

1386
01:33:39,750 --> 01:33:41,792
Zul, hurry and get Aisyah out!

1387
01:34:44,542 --> 01:34:45,542
Zul!

1388
01:34:59,042 --> 01:35:01,333
Thank you, Dear Allah!

1389
01:35:07,625 --> 01:35:09,625
Mr. Dwi Rupa, is it true
that you've bought the land?

1390
01:35:09,667 --> 01:35:12,292
- Yes, how about that, Sir?
- Please explain, Sir.

1391
01:35:13,417 --> 01:35:15,958
Alright. The disputed property land...

1392
01:35:16,125 --> 01:35:18,458
...was purchased by my dad.

1393
01:35:18,667 --> 01:35:20,499
But not for personal usage.

1394
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:23,500
Instead, it will be rightfully managed
by a social foundation.

1395
01:35:23,542 --> 01:35:26,625
So the area is safe to
be occupied by the locals.

1396
01:35:26,667 --> 01:35:27,458
Thank you.

1397
01:35:27,459 --> 01:35:29,124
Do you have any response, Sir?

1398
01:35:29,125 --> 01:35:31,042
What do you say, Sir?

1399
01:35:33,708 --> 01:35:35,417
Here it is.

1400
01:35:37,167 --> 01:35:38,708
Wait, wait.

1401
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:40,207
Pay attention to Mr. Hans.

1402
01:35:40,208 --> 01:35:41,417
Alright!

1403
01:35:43,292 --> 01:35:46,417
To celebrate our happy day...

1404
01:35:46,583 --> 01:35:50,958
...we'll have a feast, a tumpeng rice.

1405
01:35:53,083 --> 01:35:56,041
And the one who deserve to cut the rice...

1406
01:35:56,042 --> 01:35:57,958
...is none other than...

1407
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,792
...our hero, Zul!

1408
01:36:01,042 --> 01:36:04,500
Come on, Zul. Don't be shy.

1409
01:36:04,542 --> 01:36:07,291
Cut the tumpeng rice,
and give the first cut...

1410
01:36:07,292 --> 01:36:08,917
...to your special one.

1411
01:36:08,958 --> 01:36:10,958
Wink, wink!

1412
01:36:11,917 --> 01:36:12,958
Hey, Zul.

1413
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:16,000
If you wanna give it to me,
scoop some more. I'm starving.

1414
01:36:23,667 --> 01:36:26,708
Complete toppings for the most beloved.

1415
01:36:39,875 --> 01:36:41,875
Wink, wink!

1416
01:36:48,125 --> 01:36:50,958
Come on, Zul. You have to decide.

1417
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,125
Be like me, Zul. I've already chosen.

1418
01:37:24,417 --> 01:37:26,292
What a sly kid.

1419
01:37:42,208 --> 01:37:42,958
Mother.

1420
01:37:44,250 --> 01:37:47,208
Whatever happens, I will
always take care of you.

1421
01:37:48,667 --> 01:37:49,625
Thank you, Mother.

1422
01:37:51,583 --> 01:37:52,417
Yes, Zul.

1423
01:37:53,583 --> 01:37:54,708
Here, have some.

1424
01:37:56,667 --> 01:37:57,625
You're a great guy, Zul.

1425
01:38:17,333 --> 01:38:20,375
My story this time may have ended.

1426
01:38:21,042 --> 01:38:25,457
But Ashiap Man's adventure has just begun.

1427
01:38:25,458 --> 01:38:27,542
I'm ready!

1428
01:39:18,667 --> 01:39:20,083
I can sell this.
