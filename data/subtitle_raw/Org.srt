Reactionaries!

let me redo that bit...

8
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,796

On our dear bitch of an Earth

Our dear bitch of an Earth,

The road of excess leads
to the palace of wisdom. - W. Blake

25
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,752
: for instance, Chuang-tzu's dream

26
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,638
ZOHOMMM:... Borges
is a great writer...

27
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,749
GRRR:... yet he positioned himself
against the Cuban Revolution...

28
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,349
24 centuries ago he dreamed
that he was a butterfly

29
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,278
ZOHOMMM:... but
he is a great writer...

30
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,316
GRRR:... yet he positioned himself
against the Cuban Revolution...

31
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,949
when he woke up he didn't know
if he was a man dreaming

32
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,795
that he was a butterfly...

33
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,596
...or a butterfly dreaming
that it was a man.

34

he is a great writer...

35

38
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:41,116

GRRR: Don't take a single needle

00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,279

00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,516
4) PAY FOR
ANYTHING YOU DAMAGE.

48
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,158
5) DON'T HIT OR SWEAR AT PEOPLE.

49
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,320
6) DON'T DAMAGE CROPS.

50
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,878
7) DON'T TAKE LIBERTIES WITH WOMEN

51
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,040
8) DON'T ILL-TREAT CAPTIVES

52
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,950
GRRR: Don't take a single needle
or piece of thread from the masses.

55
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,269
GRRR: Don't take a single needle
or piece of thread from the masses.

56
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,280
GRRR - Good...

57
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,958
ZOHOMMM - Evil...

58
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,080
GRRR - Very good!

59
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,953
GRRR (he speaks in Basa, then translates)

60
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,912
- I say to my friend
that this Shuick

61
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,710
I know a lot, starlet,
made a screen test... science-fiction,

62
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,393
a film about the past, about '68...

63
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,598
people in trousers, shirts,
really funny thing...

64
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,918
me work interplanetary drive-in...

65
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,798
no problem...
I'm sure I can bring her to you

66
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,352
ZOHOMMM - Good...
GRRR - Aren't you convinced?...

67
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,794
ZOHOMMM - My grandfather told me
that at the explosion of the Great Mushroom

68
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,476
no one wanted to believe it...

69
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,994
excuse me, one question...
no, nothing...

70
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,391
nothing?
that's it

71
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,758
to you, sir... a very simple question:
do you think...

72
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:59,760
no sir, please...
okay, you can move, sir...

73
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,391
do you think that
the atom bomb could explode or not?

74
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,120
Let's hope so!
today?

75
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,831
not today...
...tomorrow yes

76
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,280
...please...

77
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,275
it's a question,
can't I ask?

78
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,480
no, nothing, nothing, nothing,

79
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,996
this is how
liberty gets abused,

80
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,192
this man is sitting there peacefully...

81
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,869
GRRR - My grandfather also said
that in these years '66-'68

82
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,269
he was a guerilla with Che Guevara
in Bolivia... (he cries)

83
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,351
GRRR - Here is my pledge of friendship...
in case you die

84
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,991
to die together

85
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,351
GRRR - the girl...

86
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,353
I'll bring her to you...

87
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,598
THE STALLION AND THE GAZELLE

88
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,280
THE STALLION AND THE GAZELLE

89
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,598
This is Shuick!
This is Zohommm!

90
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,440
I wonder if stars
really have little points?

91
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,758
No, that's due to our astigmatism,
it's an optical illusion

92
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,799
caused by irregularities of the cornea.

93
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,351
My optometrist says that
mild astigmatism is normal

94
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,155
and keeps us from seeing
stars as round points of light

95
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,915
Your optometrist has ruined
the joy of looking at the stars for me.

96

01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:13,680
and thus confusion

177
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:20,959
beyond the fear and the desire
the impulse to know

178
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:27,797
Irrationality of acculturation

179
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:34,595
the image can be a method of
general orientation

180
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:38,994
a new dramaturgy

181
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:48,877
Hollywood or Moscow
the same thing

182
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:55,518
one is a traitor in the cinema
as in politics

183
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:01,675
the recorded image belongs

184
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:05,790
half to the one who made it,
half to the one looking or listening to it

185
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:09,793
technology today

186
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:11,753
(8mm, magnetic tape)

187
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:13,673
is simpler

188
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,071
New Cinema

189
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:19,117
made

190
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:22,791
by those who have never made cinema

191
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:26,839
no one

192
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:28,720
may speak

193
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:30,554
in place for others

194
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:33,520
(absent)

195
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,040
to experiment on the technological vocabulary

196
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:40,840
Underground: It's important,

197
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:42,355
that it's not important.

198
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:46,518

200
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:56,398
without

201
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:57,631
submitting yourself to

202
01:21:57,960 --> 01:21:58,313
stressed out productions

203
01:21:58,640 --> 01:21:59,073

205
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:00,718
wretched fraud

just playing

207
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,073
the camera on your friends
on things you love

208
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:14,715

209
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:16,758
you make a film

210
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:20,557
the current revolutionary moment
is heterogeneous

211
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:25,876
the current revolutionary moment
is heterogeneous

212
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:27,396
internationally coherent

213
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:28,278
not perfect

214
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:35,832

217
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:59,229
the linguistic trap:
the cinema in the cinema

218
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:09,438
a new filmmaker
has to commit suicide as a filmmaker

219
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:14,317
Cinema Nôvo
question of style

220
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:20,560

224
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:41,670

225
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:47,758
we have decided
to be militant in cinema

EX-GALAXY OF THE UNCOMMUNICATED

365
02:12:16,280 --> 02:12:17,953
UNIVERSAL HISTORY OF VIOLENCE

366
02:12:23,720 --> 02:12:25,200
The one aimed at us

367
02:12:29,160 --> 02:12:31,038
...and the one we contest with

368
02:14:49,240 --> 02:14:56,556
"For our people now understand
that violence

369
02:14:56,880 --> 02:15:02,911
can take on many forms.

370
02:15:03,240 --> 02:15:10,511
It is violence to sterilize people
as has been done in India and Bolivia,

371
02:15:10,840 --> 02:15:18,156
it is violence to oppress people
by plundering their natural resources,

372
02:15:18,480 --> 02:15:24,875
by compelling them to live in misery.

373
02:15:25,240 --> 02:15:32,670
The day that our people
accept the principle

374
02:15:32,920 --> 02:15:40,157
that imperialism
by its very nature

375
02:15:40,560 --> 02:15:45,555
is violent,

376
02:15:45,880 --> 02:15:53,117
they will know how to justify
physical violence rationally as contestation.

377
02:15:53,480 --> 02:16:00,796
One of the most important
struggles of the Third World

378
02:16:01,120 --> 02:16:07,151
is the struggle
to legalize violence,

379
02:16:07,480 --> 02:16:15,115
for the West has convinced the people
that violence is bad."

380
02:24:46,080 --> 02:24:48,515
ZOHOMMM - What should we do?

381
02:24:48,920 --> 02:24:51,560
SHUICK - I could kill myself...

382
02:24:51,840 --> 02:24:54,196
GRRR - Keep calm, okay...

383
02:25:03,920 --> 02:25:07,038
The 3 - COMMUNISM
WILL NOT BRING ASCETICISM,

384
02:25:07,440 --> 02:25:10,478
BUT JOY OF LIFE, POWER OF LIFE,
AND A SATISFIED LOVE LIFE

385
02:25:10,840 --> 02:25:13,958
WILL HELP TO DO THAT.
LENIN.

386
02:25:14,360 --> 02:25:17,592
ZOHOMMM/MARIO - I, Mario,
would have done everything

387
02:25:17,960 --> 02:25:20,316
that the character did.

388
02:25:21,680 --> 02:25:24,593
I could go away and live alone,

389
02:25:29,480 --> 02:25:32,393
but, really in history,
I would lose

390
02:25:36,360 --> 02:25:40,354
Either kill one and leave the other two

391
02:25:40,680 --> 02:25:43,991
or one kills himself
and the two others remains

392
02:25:44,160 --> 02:25:47,278
or one goes.
Killing is also a problem.

393
02:25:47,400 --> 02:25:49,676
That's also a difficult solution

394
02:25:50,880 --> 02:25:54,760
The best solution,
even in this situation,

395
02:25:55,360 --> 02:25:58,592
is really to stick together always.

396
02:25:58,720 --> 02:26:03,476
Perhaps we can change
the mentality with time.

397
02:26:04,480 --> 02:26:06,392
I don't know if I expressed that well.

398
02:26:10,160 --> 02:26:14,040
SHUICK/LIDIJA - I would be happy
to live with two men...

399
02:26:14,360 --> 02:26:16,636
even with more than two...
even with several women...

400
02:26:20,440 --> 02:26:23,353
GRRR/ISAAC -
... even a billion...

401
02:26:34,720 --> 02:26:37,394
The 3 - COMMUNISM
WILL NOT BRING ASCETICISM,

402
02:26:37,720 --> 02:26:40,360
BUT JOY OF LIFE, POWER OF LIFE,
AND A SATISFIED LOVE LIFE

403
02:26:40,680 --> 02:26:43,434
WILL HELP TO DO THAT.
LENIN.

404
02:26:50,120 --> 02:26:53,875
SHUICK/LIDIJA -
Isaac: do you love Shuick?

405
02:26:54,200 --> 02:26:57,989
GRRR/ISAAC - Now that the mess
has been made... not any more

406
02:26:58,360 --> 02:27:00,716
ZOHOMMM/MARIO - If you leave
she'll be sad.

407
02:27:01,920 --> 02:27:05,231
GRRR/ISAAC -Zohommm
no chance for two men,

408
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,959
to live in one woman

409
02:27:10,280 --> 02:27:12,431
SHUICK/LIDIJA - Why should I
feel guilty?

410
02:27:23,720 --> 02:27:27,600
Because normally...
I introduced you.

411
02:27:27,840 --> 02:27:30,480
You didn't know each other before.

412
02:27:30,680 --> 02:27:33,991
Afterwards they even got married.

413
02:27:35,200 --> 02:27:37,192
SHUICK/LIDIJA -
What does that have to do with...

414
02:27:39,320 --> 02:27:42,950
ZOHOMMM/MARIO - Be quiet...
married or not married...

415
02:27:53,160 --> 02:27:56,949
I'm happy that you made love
to her with my body.

416
02:27:58,280 --> 02:28:01,876
What happened to me
could have happened to anyone.

417
02:28:02,600 --> 02:28:03,875
That's not my fault.

418
02:28:04,040 --> 02:28:07,033
Of course it's perhaps
a physical weakness...

419
02:28:07,560 --> 02:28:10,029
SHUICK/LIDIJA -... so...

420
02:28:22,840 --> 02:28:25,560
The 3 - COMMUNISM
WILL NOT BRING ASCETICISM,

421
02:28:25,880 --> 02:28:28,554
BUT JOY OF LIFE, POWER OF LIFE,
AND A SATISFIED LOVE LIFE

422
02:28:28,880 --> 02:28:31,236
WILL HELP TO DO THAT.
LENIN.

423
02:28:34,320 --> 02:28:37,950
ALL -...yes, Yes, you said it:
but you didn't understand it.

424
02:36:36,720 --> 02:36:46,719
...our homeland is the whole world
our law is liberty...

425
02:45:59,400 --> 02:46:05,795
... future humanity...
