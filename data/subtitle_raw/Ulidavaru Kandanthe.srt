1
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:04,777
Fishermen chanting.

2
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,248
﻿It's my hometown, Malpe.

3
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:31,247
﻿A major fishing town on the
Arabian Coast of Karnataka.

4
00:02:32,047 --> 00:02:35,484
﻿A town whose shores are
cleansed everyday by the sea.

5
00:02:36,245 --> 00:02:39,483
﻿But the waves can't reach
everything. Can they?

6
00:02:39,644 --> 00:02:47,322
﻿Fishermen chanting continues.

7
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:21,507
﻿Boy chanting with fishermen.

8
00:03:24,066 --> 00:03:28,904
﻿Boy starts chanting again.

9
00:03:36,622 --> 00:03:40,019
﻿I met him a few times
during my college days.

10
00:03:41,339 --> 00:03:43,378
﻿I feel he was attracted to me.

11
00:03:44,538 --> 00:03:47,376
﻿Or was he just trying to annoy me?

12
00:03:48,537 --> 00:03:49,615
﻿What would you call that?

13
00:03:50,136 --> 00:03:53,974
﻿Or did he behave the same
with everyone? I will never know.

14
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:07,569
I would see him around
during my visits to hometown.

15
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,367
﻿Incidentally, we met on that fateful day.

16
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:14,166
So is it about him?
The article you want to write.

17
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:20,363
﻿Regina?

18
00:04:22,924 --> 00:04:24,562
﻿Are you here for that interview?

19
00:04:24,563 --> 00:04:25,202
﻿Yes.

20
00:04:25,203 --> 00:04:26,361
﻿Please follow me.

21
00:04:29,641 --> 00:04:31,959
﻿No, No!
It's not only about him.

22
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,638
﻿Then why a series? I mean, is it worth it?

23
00:04:36,278 --> 00:04:38,157
﻿You can finish it in one article.

24
00:04:38,718 --> 00:04:39,677
﻿No.

25
00:04:39,718 --> 00:04:42,356
﻿There are many stories
involved in this incident.

26
00:04:43,196 --> 00:04:46,554
﻿A single article will
not do justice to them.

27
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,987
﻿Madam, Can I get you a chair?

28
00:05:01,309 --> 00:05:02,946
﻿No. Please open the cell.

29
00:05:05,027 --> 00:05:06,745
﻿It's okay. I know him.

30
00:05:07,226 --> 00:05:08,185
﻿Okay.

31
00:05:15,343 --> 00:05:16,342
﻿So what is your idea?

32
00:05:28,178 --> 00:05:29,138
﻿Sorry.

33
00:05:29,297 --> 00:05:31,616
﻿It's okay. I can understand.

34
00:05:31,816 --> 00:05:32,975
﻿Take some time.

35
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:37,733
﻿Nobody knows what really happened.

36
00:05:38,374 --> 00:05:41,412
Thereis a strange feeling
listening to everyone's version.

37
00:05:45,691 --> 00:05:48,409
﻿You feel it is true,
yet different from the other.

38
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,487
One incident seen through different eyes.

39
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:05,603
What do you prefer, Tea or Coffee?

40
00:06:07,962 --> 00:06:08,922
﻿Coffee.

41
00:06:09,642 --> 00:06:12,400
Coffee for her and tea for me.

42
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:22,315
Perspectives. What's true? Who is right?

43
00:06:22,796 --> 00:06:26,034
﻿Everything changes when you see
it from a different point of view.

44
00:06:28,674 --> 00:06:30,832
﻿So how am I supposed
to come to a conclusion?

45
00:06:31,193 --> 00:06:34,950
﻿tell this story with a conclusion.

46
00:06:35,151 --> 00:06:36,110
﻿Instead,

47
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:40,708
﻿lf every aspect and each
perspective of the story is narrated,

48
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:42,748
﻿the readers might find their own answers.

49
00:06:43,109 --> 00:06:44,068
﻿Hmmm...

50
00:06:44,867 --> 00:06:45,827
﻿Fair enough.

51
00:06:46,627 --> 00:06:48,306
﻿Ho many articles do you want to write?

52
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:53,503
﻿I don't know. Maybe 5 or 6. It all depends.

53
00:06:54,304 --> 00:06:55,463
﻿Hmmm... Okay.

54
00:06:56,063 --> 00:06:58,342
﻿Six consecutive articles
for the Tuesday edition.

55
00:06:58,662 --> 00:07:00,741
﻿And I think we can freeze on that.

56
00:07:00,742 --> 00:07:02,221
﻿Sure Sir. Thank you so much!

57
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,099
﻿So this is your first write up.

58
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,658
﻿What will you call it?

59
00:07:11,857 --> 00:07:14,135
﻿I'll tell you everything I know.

60
00:07:14,457 --> 00:07:15,694
﻿I'll tell what I saw.

61
00:07:16,256 --> 00:07:17,335
﻿I'll tell you what I know.

62
00:07:17,655 --> 00:07:21,013
Bastard﻿, What do you know?
Sit quietly. I'll talk.

63
00:07:27,772 --> 00:07:28,450
﻿Regina.

64
00:07:28,451 --> 00:07:30,449
﻿What will you name this article?

65
00:07:37,047 --> 00:07:38,246
﻿Il call it...

66
00:07:47,164 --> 00:07:54,079
"AS SEEN BY THE REST"

81
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,808
﻿Richi was a bully since childhood.

82
00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:02,806
﻿He stabbed a boy to death defending
his friend Raghu at the age of 12.

83
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:16,041
﻿Raghu disappeared without a trace.

84
00:11:16,961 --> 00:11:19,199
﻿And Richi was sent to the remand home.

85
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,598
﻿And then? What happened?

86
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:26,357
﻿He was released after
eight years in the remand home.

87
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:27,955
﻿He returned to Malpe.

88
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:31,435
﻿And looked for Raghu all over in vain.

89
00:11:31,595 --> 00:11:33,394
﻿But Raghu was nowhere to be found.

90
00:11:34,035 --> 00:11:36,193
﻿Then how did you find Raghu's whereabouts?

91
00:11:36,634 --> 00:11:39,792
﻿I didn't know either,
until I visited Bombay.

92
00:11:40,352 --> 00:11:46,949
﻿I was in Bombay to show
cashew nut samples to a buyer.

93
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:49,149
﻿He exports cashews to foreign countries.

94
00:11:49,389 --> 00:11:51,187
﻿Raghu was his acquaintance.

95
00:11:51,548 --> 00:11:55,986
﻿We visited a ladies bar for dinner
one night and Raghu joined us there.

96
00:11:56,706 --> 00:11:58,744
﻿What did he do in Bombay?

97
00:11:59,225 --> 00:12:03,102
﻿He was only 13 or 14 years old
when he fled to Bombay.

98
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:06,981
﻿He took up a job in a little
canteen at the Bombay port.

99
00:12:07,262 --> 00:12:07,981
﻿A few years later he became the cashier
as he was good with numbers.

100
00:12:07,982 --> 00:12:11,179
A few years later he became the cashier
as he was good with numbers.

101
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:17,976
﻿Gradually, he got involved in
smalltime smuggling at the Bombay port.

102
00:12:18,298 --> 00:12:22,375
﻿Then one day, he made a mess, cracking
the head of someone from the Navy.

103
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:24,375
﻿He died on the spot!

104
00:12:24,735 --> 00:12:27,773
﻿Raghu had to take refuge with another gang.

105
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:31,451
﻿He couldn't get out of the vicious circle.

106
00:12:31,532 --> 00:12:34,250
﻿So didn't he feel like
returning home in these 15 years?

107
00:12:35,091 --> 00:12:38,968
﻿He would've never come back.
He had only bad memories of here.

108
00:12:39,729 --> 00:12:42,367
﻿Not that he had good memories in Bombay.

109
00:12:43,207 --> 00:12:47,565
﻿But how many times can a man
run away from his memories?

110
00:12:48,965 --> 00:12:50,963
﻿No, no! I'm not expecting
any money out of this.

111
00:12:50,964 --> 00:12:55,202
﻿I'm just making notes. What was
the name of the ladies bar in Bombay?

112
00:12:59,241 --> 00:13:05,158
﻿I'm a regular to quite a few ladies bars.
It's hard to recall out of the blue.

113
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:07,637
﻿It's... mm...

114
00:13:07,638 --> 00:13:09,676
﻿It's... Hmmmm...

115
00:13:11,037 --> 00:13:12,876
Roopa Ladies Bar.

116
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,873
﻿So when did you meet him?

117
00:13:18,314 --> 00:13:19,913
﻿Almost a year ago.

118
00:13:24,112 --> 00:13:30,268
﻿We spoke a lot that night.
I told him about his father's death.

119
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:32,107
﻿He was very upset.

120
00:13:39,825 --> 00:13:43,343
﻿He asked me to meet him the next day
early in the morning at the Bombay harbor.

121
00:13:54,579 --> 00:13:59,936
﻿Chapter 1 Voice of Silence.

122
00:14:02,017 --> 00:14:02,977
﻿When did this happen?

123
00:14:03,336 --> 00:14:06,094
﻿Four years ago. Liver cancer.

124
00:14:06,695 --> 00:14:09,533
﻿His drinking worsened after you ran away.

125
00:14:11,133 --> 00:14:12,092
﻿Mother?

126
00:14:12,933 --> 00:14:16,450
﻿She is okay. Haven't seen
her for a long time now.

127
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:20,088
﻿I see her once in a while
when visit the market to buy fish.

128
00:14:20,969 --> 00:14:22,048
﻿Is she happy?

129
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,168
﻿I don't know.

130
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:28,805
﻿She is alone. How can she be happy?

131
00:14:31,086 --> 00:14:32,364
﻿Why don't you come back?

132
00:14:32,885 --> 00:14:36,842
﻿Where? To Malpe?
And do what?

133
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,641
﻿You could set up a business.

134
00:14:41,001 --> 00:14:44,640
﻿It's not that easy.
They'll come for me if I leave Bombay.

135
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:46,759
﻿Who?

136
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:48,238
﻿The people I work for.

137
00:14:48,998 --> 00:14:54,635
﻿I know their secrets.
They won't like me quitting.

138
00:14:56,475 --> 00:14:58,833
﻿Why don't you get her here then?

139
00:14:59,995 --> 00:15:01,073
﻿To this hellhole?

140
00:15:02,394 --> 00:15:05,032
She must've learned to live
without me by now. So let it be.

141
00:15:08,391 --> 00:15:09,430
How are others?

142
00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:11,829
﻿Others?

143
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:13,507
Richi

144
00:15:14,908 --> 00:15:16,443
﻿You remember Shankar Poojary, don't you?

145
00:15:18,147 --> 00:15:21,105
﻿Richi oversees his
legal and illegal business.

146
00:15:22,105 --> 00:15:23,144
﻿Still a bully.

147
00:15:24,345 --> 00:15:27,902
﻿Even after serving time in the remand home.

148
00:15:29,702 --> 00:15:32,300
After you fled, he was sent to
remand home for eight years.

149
00:15:44,536 --> 00:15:45,496
﻿Take this money.

150
00:15:46,256 --> 00:15:46,615
﻿What is this for?

151
00:15:47,056 --> 00:15:49,694
Keep it.
Meet my mother frequently.

152
00:15:50,054 --> 00:15:52,893
﻿Let me know if she needs money.
I'll send in more.

153
00:15:55,932 --> 00:15:57,491
﻿And don't tell anyone about meeting me.

154
00:16:08,248 --> 00:16:10,086
﻿I didn't hear from him for a while.

155
00:16:10,326 --> 00:16:14,005
﻿He then called me two
weeks before this incident.

156
00:16:15,164 --> 00:16:18,762
﻿He wanted to flee from the country
along with his mother forever.

157
00:16:18,924 --> 00:16:21,201
﻿He assured to call back
after arranging money.

158
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,800
﻿Hello.

159
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,918
﻿I'm coming to Malpe.

160
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:30,998
﻿Arrange my accommodation.

161
00:16:31,917 --> 00:16:33,516
﻿Nobody should know about my visit.

162
00:16:34,597 --> 00:16:35,916
﻿The money is arranged.

163
00:16:43,433 --> 00:16:46,711
﻿A huge deal between the Bombay underworld
and the US mafia was underway.

164
00:16:47,232 --> 00:16:51,509
﻿A red bag crucial for the deal
went missing two days prior.

165
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,029
﻿I had no choice but to steal the bag.

166
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,427
﻿But they won't spare me.

167
00:16:57,388 --> 00:16:58,826
﻿They will try and find me.

168
00:18:44,426 --> 00:18:48,864
﻿I don't know where the
switch is. We visit so rarely.

169
00:18:50,024 --> 00:18:53,902
﻿It's not a big house. But it's safe.

170
00:18:54,182 --> 00:19:01,219
﻿There is some food in the kitchen.
Some bread, jam and eggs.

171
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,898
﻿Can you cook?

172
00:19:05,138 --> 00:19:06,457
﻿Will she come with me?

173
00:19:06,618 --> 00:19:08,455
﻿Of course, She will.

174
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:10,455
﻿What if she refuses?

175
00:19:10,536 --> 00:19:12,495
﻿What is wrong with you?

176
00:19:13,175 --> 00:19:16,492
How will she say no to her only son?

177
00:19:17,174 --> 00:19:19,651
﻿Mark my words,
She will be ecstatic to see you.

178
00:19:21,972 --> 00:19:22,932
﻿Hmmm.

179
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:29,248
﻿Well in that case I'll need
your help with her passport.

180
00:19:30,768 --> 00:19:34,086
﻿It will take a month or two.
I can't stay here much longer.

181
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:37,244
Don't worry about all that.
I'll take care of it.

182
00:19:44,922 --> 00:19:45,881
﻿Keep this money.

183
00:19:46,683 --> 00:19:48,241
﻿I'll send more from Dubai.

184
00:19:49,081 --> 00:19:50,120
﻿Do you have a passport?

185
00:19:50,161 --> 00:19:50,919
﻿Yes!

186
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,958
﻿I've had my share of Dubai dreams.

187
00:19:55,238 --> 00:19:59,435
﻿Okay then, I'll make
arrangements on reaching Dubai.

188
00:20:00,476 --> 00:20:03,435
﻿I'll send tickets for the both of you
after mom's passport is done.

189
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:06,433
﻿You'll have to accompany her to Dubai.

190
00:20:06,794 --> 00:20:08,993
﻿To Dubai? Will I get a job there?

191
00:20:10,952 --> 00:20:13,030
I have friends in Dubai. I'll talk to them.

192
00:20:13,432 --> 00:20:15,190
﻿Alright. I'll go now.

193
00:20:15,551 --> 00:20:16,589
﻿Get ready by 8 pm.

194
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,599
<i>♫ ﻿If you need anything give me a call. ♫
♫ The phone is right there. ♫</i>

195
00:20:38,781 --> 00:20:43,338
<i>♫ ﻿Hide and seek, ♫
♫ Away from the womb. ♫</i>

196
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:47,737
<i>♫ ﻿You went beyond the light. ♫</i>

197
00:20:47,978 --> 00:20:52,335
<i>♫ ﻿How high into the sky have you flown? ♫</i>

198
00:20:52,896 --> 00:20:57,133
<i>♫ ﻿That you cannot see your own mother. ♫</i>

199
00:20:57,335 --> 00:21:01,173
<i>♫ ﻿Fingers have dried, ♫</i>

200
00:21:01,332 --> 00:21:05,570
<i>♫ ﻿Holding the food you've forgotten. ♫</i>

201
00:21:05,811 --> 00:21:10,169
<i>♫ ﻿I am worn out waiting. ♫</i>

202
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:13,567
﻿I called him at 8 pm to
tell that the car was waiting.

203
00:21:14,128 --> 00:21:18,045
﻿He was nervous, perhaps because
he was seeing his mother after years.

204
00:21:25,044 --> 00:21:32,720
<i>♫ ﻿A full grown tree is ♫
♫ eager to see its roots. ♫</i>

205
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:41,997
<i>♫ ﻿A bird of the vast skies ♫

206
00:21:43,876 --> 00:21:48,193

207
00:21:48,354 --> 00:21:52,992
<i>♫ ﻿I can come home again. ♫</i>

208
00:21:53,072 --> 00:21:57,390
<i>♫ ﻿I wish to go back into your womb, ♫</i>

209
00:21:57,631 --> 00:22:04,187
<i>♫ ﻿To be born again with painless labour. ♫</i>

210
00:22:30,217 --> 00:22:34,016
<i>♫ ﻿The mother's eyes are always Seeking. ♫</i>

211
00:22:34,176 --> 00:22:38,613
<i>♫ ﻿Hearing the child's call, ♫</i>

212
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:42,413
<i>♫ ﻿I came running. ♫</i>

213
00:22:42,573 --> 00:22:45,811
<i>♫ ﻿Oh my Mother! ♫</i>

214
00:22:46,411 --> 00:22:49,547
﻿After visiting his mother,
he called me around midnight...

215
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:52,568
when he was
back at the farmhouse.

216
00:22:53,369 --> 00:22:54,648
﻿He was overjoyed.

217
00:22:55,168 --> 00:22:57,247
﻿His mother had agreed to come.

218
00:22:57,807 --> 00:23:00,646
﻿He wanted the car again
at 7 pm the next day.

219
00:23:01,006 --> 00:23:02,445
﻿His mother had called him for dinner.

220
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,717
﻿I called him the next afternoon.

221
00:25:12,274 --> 00:25:13,914
﻿We talked for a bit.

222
00:25:14,274 --> 00:25:17,671
﻿He said that he heard a car arrive.

223
00:25:19,831 --> 00:25:21,510
﻿Gimme a minute. I hear a car outside.

224
00:25:33,026 --> 00:25:34,066
﻿They are coming.

225
00:25:34,745 --> 00:25:36,264
﻿Did you tell anyone about me?

226
00:25:36,505 --> 00:25:38,983
﻿No. I didn't tell anyone.

227
00:25:39,503 --> 00:25:40,542
﻿How did they know?

228
00:25:40,822 --> 00:25:42,302
﻿I think I saw a gun.

229
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:44,781
﻿I'll call back.

230
00:26:57,473 --> 00:26:58,872
﻿Please connect a trunk call to Dubai.

231
00:26:58,873 --> 00:27:00,063
﻿Operator: Telephone number Sir.

232
00:27:01,592 --> 00:27:03,070
﻿Seven five eight double zero.

233
00:27:03,391 --> 00:27:05,189
﻿Operator: Okay, I'll
call back in 5 minutes.

234
00:27:15,986 --> 00:27:17,624
﻿I visited the farmhouse he stayed at.

235
00:27:18,465 --> 00:27:19,904
﻿I could feel his presence there.

236
00:27:20,984 --> 00:27:22,383
I could feel what he felt.

237
00:27:24,503 --> 00:27:26,900
I experienced his confusion.

238
00:27:41,176 --> 00:27:44,334
﻿I sensed a chapter coming to an end.

239
00:27:48,093 --> 00:27:51,131
﻿The next chapter was in the making.

240
00:28:41,439 --> 00:28:44,239
Tearing the poster, Out came the hero.

241
00:28:45,845 --> 00:28:47,245
Your attention please!

242
00:28:47,689 --> 00:28:49,889
As the Cuban kid always said

243
00:28:50,338 --> 00:28:54,338
Here we meet once again!

244
00:28:57,661 --> 00:29:01,461
Chapter 2
Richard Anthony Alias Richi.

245
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:02,783
﻿What can I say?

246
00:29:06,741 --> 00:29:08,180
﻿I lost a brother.

247
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,898
﻿Richi was like a son to me.

248
00:29:12,538 --> 00:29:13,577
﻿B@$tarD!

249
00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:16,296
He is an A$$h0lE, a $ON OF A BitcA!

250
00:29:17,216 --> 00:29:18,415
He should rot in hell!

251
00:29:18,856 --> 00:29:20,374
﻿There is a story about him.

252
00:29:20,935 --> 00:29:24,374
﻿When Richi was in the remand home there
was a ruthless cop who beat up the kids.

253
00:29:24,654 --> 00:29:28,771
﻿On his way out of the remand home,
Richi stole his uniform.

254
00:29:29,252 --> 00:29:32,170
﻿And wore that police belt everywhere
he went around town.

255
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:33,650
﻿Can you believe that?

256
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:14,219
What a waste!

257
00:30:33,446 --> 00:30:35,546
Thank you!

258
00:30:39,766 --> 00:30:41,366
What a risk!

259
00:30:41,862 --> 00:30:45,962
Old customs of the past,
sacred land, sacred house

260
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:53,783
God will forgive anyone who sins in that
house, but the householder will never forgive.

261
00:30:57,219 --> 00:30:58,519
Smiles!

262
00:31:09,315 --> 00:31:11,273
﻿I know all about Shankar Poojary.

263
00:31:11,834 --> 00:31:13,472
﻿He may be an important man to these guys.

264
00:31:14,633 --> 00:31:16,471
﻿It's all black money.

265
00:31:17,232 --> 00:31:19,870
﻿They say he ruled the
Bombay underworld at one time.

266
00:31:19,871 --> 00:31:21,069
﻿Bullshit!

267
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,668
﻿Then why did he flee from Bombay?

268
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:26,187
﻿They kicked him out.

269
00:31:26,348 --> 00:31:28,387
﻿He can't even set foot in Bombay anymore.

270
00:31:29,108 --> 00:31:30,586
﻿He is an exile.

271
00:32:46,748 --> 00:32:49,026
﻿Please find that god
forsaken picture, will you?

272
00:32:49,186 --> 00:32:51,144
﻿I've told a million times
that it is a dummy camera.

273
00:32:51,506 --> 00:32:52,664
﻿You don't believe my words.

274
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:56,023
﻿What are you laughing at?

275
00:32:56,304 --> 00:32:57,263
﻿Do I look crazy?

276
00:32:57,424 --> 00:32:58,384
﻿You guys are crazy!

277
00:32:58,463 --> 00:32:59,960
﻿- Have you seen yourselves...
- Shut up!

278
00:33:04,101 --> 00:33:05,906
﻿You were saying something
interesting. Continue.

279
00:33:06,781 --> 00:33:09,098
﻿You are harassing me
for a picture I never took.

280
00:33:09,379 --> 00:33:10,218
﻿I'm done with you.

281
00:33:10,219 --> 00:33:11,577
- Please stop...
- Shut up!

282
00:33:14,137 --> 00:33:15,215
﻿She is so cute.

283
00:33:18,655 --> 00:33:19,999
﻿This tea needs a little more sugar.

284
00:33:20,615 --> 00:33:21,574
﻿Please continue.

285
00:33:22,854 --> 00:33:23,814
﻿Shh...

286
00:33:24,613 --> 00:33:25,573
﻿You...

287
00:33:28,651 --> 00:33:29,611
﻿What happened?

288
00:33:29,771 --> 00:33:30,730
﻿Speak baby.

289
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,209
﻿Wait a minute.

290
00:33:34,089 --> 00:33:36,807
﻿Now that you are done talking,
let me have a look at the camera.

291
00:33:37,328 --> 00:33:39,647
﻿Dummy camera huh, What a piece of junk!

292
00:33:40,207 --> 00:33:41,645
﻿Sorry. This not the same camera.

293
00:33:42,326 --> 00:33:44,004
﻿What? Have you lost it?

294
00:33:44,285 --> 00:33:45,245
﻿It's the same camera.

295
00:33:45,324 --> 00:33:47,883
﻿No, it is not.
That camera had a flash as I recall.

296
00:33:48,483 --> 00:33:50,522
﻿How can a dummy camera have a flash?

297
00:33:51,122 --> 00:33:54,000
﻿That is the point.
The real camera had flash as recall.

298
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,920
﻿So it can't be a dummy camera.

299
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,078
﻿Hand over my photo
and I'll stop troubling you.

300
00:34:00,959 --> 00:34:03,797
﻿How can I give a photo I don't have.

301
00:34:03,998 --> 00:34:05,196
﻿Not my problem lady.

302
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:08,196
﻿You should have thought
before being a nosy parker.

303
00:34:08,197 --> 00:34:09,195
﻿I was just a kid.

304
00:34:09,355 --> 00:34:10,394
﻿So was I.

305
00:34:10,555 --> 00:34:13,393
﻿Yeah right! And I have
memories of cops chasing that kid.

306
00:34:15,912 --> 00:34:16,872
﻿Arrgh, What the hell!

307
00:34:17,832 --> 00:34:19,591
﻿Listen girl,
You're meddling in my life again.

308
00:34:20,311 --> 00:34:21,830
﻿Okay fine. I'm sorry.

309
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:26,189
﻿I've lost that photo.
Please let me off the hook.

310
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:27,987
﻿Hmmm...

311
00:34:28,668 --> 00:34:29,628
﻿Please.

312
00:34:30,307 --> 00:34:31,385
﻿Wait, Wait. I'm thinking.

313
00:34:34,466 --> 00:34:35,426
﻿Please!

314
00:34:35,626 --> 00:34:38,983
﻿Dinesha, have you tasted
the fish fry at Rama's hotel?

315
00:34:39,463 --> 00:34:41,782
﻿I swear its the best in Udupi.

316
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,059
﻿I'll try my best darling.

317
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:17,327
﻿Are you here to meet me?

318
00:35:17,729 --> 00:35:19,847
﻿Yes. You are Richi's father.

319
00:35:20,408 --> 00:35:20,926
﻿Yes.

320
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:24,285
﻿Can I talk to you for a while.
I wanted some information.

321
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,166
﻿Sure.

322
00:35:26,886 --> 00:35:29,323
﻿How do you know Richi?

323
00:35:30,204 --> 00:35:33,082
﻿We've met a couple of times.
But this is not personal.

324
00:35:33,522 --> 00:35:38,120
﻿I'm a journalist.
I'm writing an article about the incident.

325
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,640
﻿So you know...

326
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:41,678
﻿Yes. I understand.

327
00:35:42,799 --> 00:35:46,476
﻿If you don't mind,
can we talk in my office.

328
00:35:47,077 --> 00:35:48,037
﻿Sure, sure.

329
00:35:50,196 --> 00:35:52,075
﻿I used to come here as a kid.

330
00:35:52,436 --> 00:35:53,034
﻿Really?

331
00:35:53,035 --> 00:35:57,473
﻿Yes. My parents brought me here
during my vacations in Udupi.

332
00:35:58,553 --> 00:36:00,271
﻿I'm really sorry to bother you with this.

333
00:36:00,632 --> 00:36:01,592
﻿It's okay.

334
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,869
﻿Tell me, how can I help you?

335
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:08,868
﻿When did you last see your son?

336
00:36:13,307 --> 00:36:15,585
﻿He visited the previous
day of the incident.

337
00:36:18,346 --> 00:36:23,302
﻿Did you break Nikson's nose
in fight three days ago.

338
00:36:24,063 --> 00:36:25,662
﻿What the hell!

339
00:36:27,822 --> 00:36:28,782
﻿Who's Nikson?

340
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,459
﻿I had many fights 3 days ago.

341
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,178
﻿And I keep breaking noses man.
That is my business.

342
00:36:35,418 --> 00:36:39,256
Richi, I'm talking about
Mr. Gonsalves’ son.

343
00:36:41,056 --> 00:36:43,655
﻿Mr. Gonualvas came to church yesterday.

344
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:49,252
How can I preach at the church
when my own son is...

345
00:36:50,892 --> 00:36:51,852
﻿Your own son?

346
00:36:54,091 --> 00:36:57,689
﻿You should have asked
Mr. Gonzales why I hit his son.

347
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:00,808
﻿I didn't break his nose.

348
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:02,847
﻿That B@$tarD got away
before I could do it.

349
00:37:07,526 --> 00:37:09,444
﻿I ain't doing nothing Sir.

350
00:37:10,085 --> 00:37:11,773
﻿And you summoned me
for such a baseless rumor

351
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:14,322
﻿Now if your point is over, I'll go.

352
00:37:14,643 --> 00:37:15,682
﻿Thank you. Welcome.

353
00:37:17,642 --> 00:37:19,080
Stop bothering me.

354
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:20,281
﻿I have loads of work.

355
00:37:20,801 --> 00:37:23,679
﻿May Jesus ‘peace be upon him’
bless you and Mr. Gonsalves.

356
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,639
﻿If not his son.

357
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:28,676
﻿And that was the
last time I saw him.

358
00:37:33,836 --> 00:37:35,194
﻿Stop bothering me.

359
00:37:35,235 --> 00:37:36,274
﻿I have loads of work.

360
00:37:36,714 --> 00:37:39,512
﻿May Jesus ‘peace be upon him’
bless you and Mr. Gonsalves.

361
00:37:39,553 --> 00:37:40,551
﻿If not his son.

362
00:37:43,431 --> 00:37:44,910
﻿Where will we find Nikson?

363
00:37:44,951 --> 00:37:45,670
﻿Why?

364
00:37:45,751 --> 00:37:46,711
﻿I have a job to do.

365
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:47,869
﻿What job?

366
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,068
﻿I have to break his nose.

367
00:38:04,504 --> 00:38:05,742
﻿Richi, Be gentle.

368
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:07,981
Will you shut up?

369
00:38:11,501 --> 00:38:12,460
﻿What is this bullshit?

370
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:17,018
﻿Your father is spreading rumors
around town that I broke your o e

371
00:38:18,457 --> 00:38:20,536
﻿Uh oh! The nose looks fine!

372
00:38:21,057 --> 00:38:22,017
﻿Come here.

373
00:38:34,012 --> 00:38:35,410
﻿Now, this looks superb!

374
00:38:36,211 --> 00:38:39,808
﻿lf the townspeople feel the nose is not
broken well, my reputation will be at stake.

375
00:38:40,529 --> 00:38:42,447
﻿If Richi breaks a nose,
this is how it should be.

376
00:38:45,567 --> 00:38:47,606
﻿No hard feelings bro.
Purely professional.

377
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:54,323
﻿What?

378
00:38:57,123 --> 00:39:01,241
﻿We regret the inconvenience caused. The
match is postponed due to technical reasons.

379
00:39:08,598 --> 00:39:11,397
﻿What are you laughing at
B@$tarD$? Wanna get shot?

380
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:31,988
﻿How much shall I buy?

381
00:39:32,429 --> 00:39:33,388
﻿Get a crate for now.

382
00:39:33,389 --> 00:39:35,428
﻿$On OF A BitcA!
Who the hell is that?

383
00:39:36,948 --> 00:39:37,907
﻿What?

384
00:39:37,947 --> 00:39:39,826
﻿I was working in peace by
myself and you butt in like this.

385
00:39:39,827 --> 00:39:43,184
Shit! I don't even understand his
dialect. What the hell happened now?

386
00:39:43,184 --> 00:39:45,183
Use my real name. Will you?

387
00:39:45,944 --> 00:39:47,663
﻿What is that "Loverboy" huh?

388
00:39:47,823 --> 00:39:49,621
﻿The whole town calls you by that name.

389
00:39:49,862 --> 00:39:51,981
﻿I don't like that.
Just call me by my name.

390
00:39:52,261 --> 00:39:53,780
﻿Alright! Where is Democracy?

391
00:39:54,501 --> 00:39:58,978
﻿Dont you understand?
Left a kid all alone in that darkness.

392
00:39:59,458 --> 00:40:00,777
Democracy, come here.

393
00:40:01,617 --> 00:40:02,096
﻿Why?

394
00:40:02,418 --> 00:40:04,222
﻿send him for a bit.
I have a little job for him.

395
00:40:04,896 --> 00:40:05,856
﻿Listen!

396
00:40:06,216 --> 00:40:08,774
﻿Don't waste time chatting with them.
Come back soon.

397
00:40:08,895 --> 00:40:09,854
﻿Go.

398
00:40:14,972 --> 00:40:19,410
﻿Dude, you sent a kid to buy beer!
He can't even lift that crate.

399
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,607
﻿Rayban?

400
00:40:33,085 --> 00:40:35,164
He is asking if your Sunglasses are Rayban.

401
00:40:36,404 --> 00:40:37,563
﻿Yes. Why?

402
00:40:37,884 --> 00:40:38,843
﻿Is it original?

403
00:40:39,243 --> 00:40:39,762
﻿Yes.

404
00:40:40,162 --> 00:40:41,762
﻿Do you have one more back at home?

405
00:40:41,921 --> 00:40:42,441
﻿Yes.

406
00:40:42,521 --> 00:40:43,673
﻿Can you give these to me then?

407
00:40:45,361 --> 00:40:46,080
﻿Why do you want them?

408
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,280
﻿To wear them.

409
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:49,438
﻿What is your name?

410
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:50,479
﻿Satisha.

411
00:40:51,038 --> 00:40:51,757
﻿Don't you go to school?

412
00:40:51,918 --> 00:40:53,157
﻿I go during holidays.

413
00:40:53,398 --> 00:40:54,358
﻿To play.

414
00:40:56,157 --> 00:40:57,674
﻿Ask him, how much has he studied.

415
00:40:58,395 --> 00:40:59,714
﻿How much have you studied?

416
00:41:00,754 --> 00:41:03,833
﻿Democracy for the people,
by the people, to the people.

417
00:41:05,313 --> 00:41:06,272
﻿What's that?

418
00:41:10,271 --> 00:41:12,029
﻿He was caught at school
smoking a cigarette.

419
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:13,948
﻿It was a beedi.

420
00:41:13,989 --> 00:41:15,028
﻿Oh, a beedi!

421
00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:16,428
﻿A beedi is fine.

422
00:41:22,426 --> 00:41:23,424
﻿Democracy!

423
00:41:24,905 --> 00:41:25,864
﻿Let's go.

424
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,223
﻿I'll go now.

425
00:41:27,464 --> 00:41:28,623
﻿Hey, come here.

426
00:41:42,699 --> 00:41:43,658
﻿Thanks!

427
00:41:47,256 --> 00:41:47,895
﻿Who is that kid?

428
00:41:48,135 --> 00:41:51,773
﻿Vasu's son. He is always with Munna.

429
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,650
So... Where are we heading?

430
00:42:00,131 --> 00:42:03,409
﻿Let's go for a ride man.
What do you say?

431
00:42:22,243 --> 00:42:23,203
﻿Hey Richi.

432
00:42:25,841 --> 00:42:26,841
Yikes! What's that?

433
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,240
﻿Why dude?

434
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,141
Where did you get weed at this hour?

435
00:42:35,757 --> 00:42:36,916
What are they upto this late?

436
00:42:38,716 --> 00:42:40,715
They are painting the
tiger dancers for tomorrow.

437
00:42:44,714 --> 00:42:46,312
Okay. Give mea drag.

438
00:42:48,392 --> 00:42:49,631
Pick up the one you threw away.

439
00:42:49,992 --> 00:42:51,489
Are you going to smoke the whole joint?

440
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:58,468
When is “Shankaranna's
yakshagana for the ex-voto?

441
00:42:59,388 --> 00:43:02,066
﻿Oh, it slipped my mind.
It's today.

442
00:43:02,067 --> 00:43:04,664
Ugh, What time is it?

443
00:43:06,705 --> 00:43:07,665
﻿11 pm.

444
00:43:09,664 --> 00:43:11,222
It's not too late. Let's go.

445
00:43:12,783 --> 00:43:13,821
﻿What about him?

446
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,338
﻿Look at his plight!
He has drunk too many.

447
00:43:21,819 --> 00:43:23,338
The ASSh0l3 has passed out.

448
00:43:26,098 --> 00:43:27,935
We can't take him along. Let's go.

449
00:43:28,456 --> 00:43:29,895
﻿Okay.
Hey, wait up.

450
00:43:31,055 --> 00:43:32,134
Give me another drag.

451
00:43:32,255 --> 00:43:33,733
How much will you smoke up?

452
00:43:33,734 --> 00:43:37,932
Bhagawata singing.

453
00:43:39,972 --> 00:43:41,546
I hope the act doesn't last till morning.

454
00:43:42,051 --> 00:43:44,489
I don't think so. It might rain.

455
00:43:44,969 --> 00:43:46,689
We have to suffer along with Shankaranna.

456
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:48,707
﻿Gimme a moment. I'll catch up.
V4 Okay.

457
00:43:59,844 --> 00:44:00,804
﻿Hello, Mr. Artist!

458
00:44:01,124 --> 00:44:04,881
﻿A sword in one hand and a gun in another.
Where are you looting tonight?

459
00:44:06,042 --> 00:44:08,120
Nah, No plans of heist.

460
00:44:08,121 --> 00:44:10,519
How long can you hold
the tide back with a broom.

461
00:44:13,159 --> 00:44:17,317
﻿Spit the fire out of your mouth.
Or it will burn you from inside.

462
00:44:17,318 --> 00:44:20,595
﻿Are you curious about what
happened next, my friend?

463
00:44:20,676 --> 00:44:27,192
﻿When the merchants were sailing on
the waters of Malpe a storm hit their ship.

464
00:44:28,114 --> 00:44:31,311
﻿Shankara, I'm going to sleep.
‘Okay.

465
00:44:31,472 --> 00:44:36,908
﻿When the merchants were sailing in
Malpe's waters a storm hit their ship.

466
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:44,907
﻿Sire Madhvacharya who was meditating at the shore
saved the sinking ship with his divine powers.

467
00:44:54,063 --> 00:44:55,368
You finally had some time to come!

468
00:45:00,101 --> 00:45:07,256
﻿The grateful merchants offered anything
on the ship as a token of gratitude.

469
00:45:08,337 --> 00:45:09,297
﻿Listen...

470
00:45:10,977 --> 00:45:16,774
﻿Bhagawata singing.

471
00:45:42,125 --> 00:45:49,802
﻿lf Madhvacharya had searched the
ship well, he might have found more than..

472
00:45:50,241 --> 00:45:57,918
﻿the two statues of Krishna and
Balarama hidden in sandalwood trunks.

473
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:05,995
﻿My friend, there are still such precious
treasures in the depth of the oceans.

474
00:46:11,043 --> 00:46:12,003
Do you know Balu?

475
00:46:12,282 --> 00:46:13,242
﻿Yes.

476
00:46:13,282 --> 00:46:14,242
Where will we find him?

477
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:16,960
At this hour, I guess he'd be home.

478
00:46:17,121 --> 00:46:18,399
﻿Let's go then.

479
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,638
Not now, Tomorrow morning is fine.

480
00:46:23,399 --> 00:46:24,358
﻿We'll talk later.

481
00:46:30,915 --> 00:46:32,874
I had sent for Munna.

482
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:33,793
Has he come yet?

483
00:46:33,794 --> 00:46:34,993
He has been informed Anna.

484
00:46:34,994 --> 00:46:36,233
He'll be here soon.

485
00:46:41,671 --> 00:46:43,430
﻿Aren't you giving
attention to these things?

486
00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:46,828
﻿We've 140 boats.
And there are other dealings too.

487
00:46:49,227 --> 00:46:50,426
﻿What are these two for?

488
00:46:54,266 --> 00:46:57,144
﻿It's not about the money,
It's about loyalty.

489
00:46:57,865 --> 00:47:02,062
﻿If we let him off easily,
the others will take us lightly.

490
00:47:02,503 --> 00:47:03,463
﻿I'll take care of it.

491
00:47:04,183 --> 00:47:07,220
﻿Don't overdo it.
Just a simple lesson.

492
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:11,619
﻿What's funny?

493
00:47:11,779 --> 00:47:17,017
﻿If you send Richi to mow a lawn,
he will mow down a jungle.

494
00:47:18,496 --> 00:47:21,575
﻿﻿He broke someone's nose yesterday.

495
00:47:21,656 --> 00:47:22,894
﻿You $On OF A BitcA!

496
00:47:23,255 --> 00:47:24,560
﻿Are you still high from yesterday?

497
00:47:26,853 --> 00:47:27,813
﻿Come here.

498
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:36,569
Anna, Munna is here.

499
00:47:36,969 --> 00:47:37,929
Tell him to wait.

500
00:47:40,808 --> 00:47:43,086
﻿Look here, Just a simple lesson.

501
00:47:44,167 --> 00:47:45,885
﻿Don't be a loose cannon.

502
00:47:49,165 --> 00:47:50,124
﻿Walk with me.

503
00:47:57,881 --> 00:47:58,880
﻿Give me a cigar.

504
00:47:59,121 --> 00:48:01,999
﻿Don't give him the cigar.
We'll be screwed if Shankaranna finds out.

505
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,518
﻿Nobody will notice a cigar missing.

506
00:48:03,639 --> 00:48:05,290
﻿It's the same old shit with him every time.

507
00:48:09,596 --> 00:48:10,556
﻿Hey Munna!

508
00:48:11,837 --> 00:48:12,796
﻿Come here.

509
00:48:13,276 --> 00:48:14,274
﻿I'll be back. Wait here.

510
00:48:18,833 --> 00:48:22,950
Alright. I'll send someone with the car
as soon as I get more information.

511
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:25,470
﻿He'll take you there.

512
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:26,870
﻿First,

513
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:28,188
﻿Find Balu.

514
00:48:32,588 --> 00:48:35,386
﻿Balu is one among the tiger dancers.
Last night...

515
00:48:41,344 --> 00:48:42,304
﻿Hey Sudhi!

516
00:48:43,464 --> 00:48:46,581
﻿He was at the school in Malpe last night.

517
00:48:46,982 --> 00:48:48,901
﻿Everyone must've left
for Car street this morning.

518
00:48:55,059 --> 00:48:56,857
﻿Here comes the A$$AQie!

519
00:48:56,938 --> 00:48:58,296
﻿What did I do?

520
00:48:58,418 --> 00:48:59,760
﻿The idiot needs an explanation too.

521
00:48:59,977 --> 00:49:01,281
﻿You are talking too much thes days

522
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:07,654
﻿Where are we going?

523
00:49:08,134 --> 00:49:09,630
﻿To your dad's house.
Shut up and follow.

524
00:49:11,492 --> 00:49:19,169
﻿Janmashtami celebrations in Udupi

525
00:49:54,316 --> 00:49:55,429
﻿The photo is clicked already.

526
00:49:57,634 --> 00:49:59,411
﻿I don't have spare coins.
Share this among yourselves.

527
00:49:59,434 --> 00:50:00,394
﻿Thank you!

528
00:50:05,631 --> 00:50:06,230
﻿Hey!

529
00:50:06,391 --> 00:50:08,109
﻿What's our share?

530
00:50:08,191 --> 00:50:14,826
﻿lf we have to share a hundred rupees among
the four of us. Should we divide or multiply?

531
00:50:15,067 --> 00:50:17,186
﻿I think we should subtract.

532
00:50:17,187 --> 00:50:20,985
﻿You idiot!
We must divide.

533
00:50:21,065 --> 00:50:23,624
﻿Then... How much is 100 divided by 4?

534
00:50:26,903 --> 00:50:32,819
I have an idea. Let's buy 4 ice candies,
Collect the change and divide it.

535
00:50:33,381 --> 00:50:35,218
﻿Okay.
I want the yellow one.

536
00:50:37,299 --> 00:50:38,259
﻿Democracy!

537
00:50:39,058 --> 00:50:40,017
﻿Come here.

538
00:50:40,618 --> 00:50:42,536
﻿All three of you stand in a line.
I'll be back.

539
00:50:46,415 --> 00:50:47,375
﻿Making a killing, eh?

540
00:50:47,574 --> 00:50:50,773
It's decent.
Business isn‘t as good anymore.

541
00:50:51,334 --> 00:50:52,293
﻿Take this.

542
00:50:53,173 --> 00:50:56,970
﻿That's all?
That girl gave me a hundred bucks.

543
00:51:03,209 --> 00:51:04,169
﻿Richi.

544
00:51:28,878 --> 00:51:29,838
﻿Is this the same camera?

545
00:51:30,158 --> 00:51:31,118
﻿Uh oh! It's not.

546
00:51:31,477 --> 00:51:33,436
﻿I will click some photos
if you care to move aside.

547
00:51:34,437 --> 00:51:35,036
﻿Click mine.

548
00:51:35,396 --> 00:51:37,114
﻿I'm not intere ted.

549
00:51:38,195 --> 00:51:40,113
﻿You were very interested 15 years ago.

550
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:43,313
﻿I will be really interested when the
police chase you the next time.

551
00:51:44,672 --> 00:51:45,991
﻿I won't make you wait for long.

552
00:51:46,152 --> 00:51:47,111
﻿Okay. Good!

553
00:51:48,151 --> 00:51:50,709
﻿lf you are not developing them
into photos, why do even click them?

554
00:51:51,629 --> 00:51:53,509
﻿Who said that I don't
develop these into photos?

555
00:51:53,629 --> 00:51:55,107
﻿You do?
Of course.

556
00:51:55,309 --> 00:51:56,347
﻿Then, give me my photo.

557
00:51:56,748 --> 00:51:58,307
﻿Why are you so obsessed with that photo?

558
00:51:58,587 --> 00:52:01,505
﻿Well Madam, I don't have
any photos of my childhood.

559
00:52:01,825 --> 00:52:04,304
﻿And you captured the
most important moment of my life.

560
00:52:04,665 --> 00:52:05,932
﻿How can I let that go so easily’?

561
00:52:06,304 --> 00:52:08,102
﻿I've already told you, that pho...

562
00:52:11,902 --> 00:52:12,861
﻿Oh oh!

563
00:52:13,301 --> 00:52:14,940
So I'll have to take your leave now.

564
00:52:15,461 --> 00:52:17,539
﻿But the next time we meet
please get that photo.

565
00:52:17,699 --> 00:52:19,337
﻿Oh! Can I also come with you.

566
00:52:19,338 --> 00:52:21,297
﻿I'm sure I'll get some
interesting pictures.

567
00:52:22,258 --> 00:52:23,217
﻿Shall we take her along?

568
00:52:24,857 --> 00:52:26,123
﻿Not this time darling. Next time.

569
00:52:29,175 --> 00:52:31,693
﻿The police won't chase me yet.
Get the photo.

570
00:52:37,091 --> 00:52:38,090
- Where is he?
- Jod raste

571
00:52:40,051 --> 00:52:41,010
﻿At the junction.

572
00:52:43,929 --> 00:52:45,288
Dineshanna, Where are you headed?

573
00:52:47,328 --> 00:52:48,287
﻿Jod raste.

574
00:52:48,328 --> 00:52:49,287
﻿Wanna race?

575
00:52:50,207 --> 00:52:51,885
﻿Let's see how far can you keep up.

576
00:52:51,926 --> 00:52:53,844
﻿Pedal hard! Fast
Faster, Faster, Faster.

577
00:52:55,485 --> 00:52:57,283
﻿Faster, Faster, Faster

578
00:54:27,649 --> 00:54:28,287
Hey, Why did you stop?

579
00:54:28,288 --> 00:54:29,248
Hey, Why did you stop?

580
00:54:29,408 --> 00:54:31,007
﻿Once more, Shall we?
Music.

581
00:55:22,987 --> 00:55:24,585
I'm so beat after all that dancing.

582
00:55:24,747 --> 00:55:26,625
﻿I'm out of practice.
Gimme a cigarette.

583
00:55:37,782 --> 00:55:38,741
Once more?

584
00:55:42,779 --> 00:55:44,818
﻿Hey, this is our tiger, right?

585
00:55:45,458 --> 00:55:47,696
﻿We don't want to be
hunting the wrong tigers.

586
00:55:50,897 --> 00:55:51,857
﻿Aww!

587
00:55:52,255 --> 00:55:53,415
This tiger is dead!

588
00:55:55,174 --> 00:55:56,134
﻿This tig...

589
00:55:56,334 --> 00:55:57,812
﻿He won't die so easily.

590
00:55:58,773 --> 00:56:00,612
﻿He needs at least an hour to wake up.

591
00:56:03,891 --> 00:56:05,889
Lets dance again, shall we?

592
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:08,129
We have time till my tiger wakes up.

593
00:56:24,563 --> 00:56:26,162
Raghu Is in town.

594
00:56:26,163 --> 00:56:28,160
Shankaranna sent me to take you to him.

595
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:35,197
﻿Hey Sudhi. Take the tiger to the harbor
in the rickshaw. I'll meet you there.

596
00:56:37,878 --> 00:56:38,837
﻿I'll take your leave now.

597
00:56:49,914 --> 00:56:50,952
﻿Do you have a paan?

598
00:57:03,508 --> 00:57:05,586
﻿Dinesha, come with me.

599
00:57:13,264 --> 00:57:14,224
﻿Where are you guys going?

600
00:57:15,183 --> 00:57:17,582
﻿To your dad's house.
Shut up and do as I said.

601
00:57:20,141 --> 00:57:21,979
﻿I gave it to hold, not to wear.

602
00:57:28,937 --> 00:57:29,897
﻿Where to?

603
00:57:30,458 --> 00:57:31,976
To meet an old friend.

604
00:58:01,365 --> 00:58:02,325
﻿Hold the gun.

605
00:58:33,793 --> 00:58:34,753
Are you sure he is here?

606
00:58:34,792 --> 00:58:36,350
Yes, Shankaranna said he is here.

607
00:58:42,989 --> 00:58:43,948
﻿No response.

608
00:58:44,748 --> 00:58:45,267
﻿Anna.

609
00:58:45,587 --> 00:58:46,662
﻿Can you please move the car?

610
00:58:46,748 --> 00:58:47,707
Our lorry has to pass by.

611
00:58:49,946 --> 00:58:50,906
﻿Whose lorry is that?

612
00:58:52,105 --> 00:58:53,983
﻿Hey! Go, give him a nice beating.

613
00:58:55,744 --> 00:58:56,704
﻿Go!

614
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:01,928
Do you think he can pick a fight?

615
00:59:09,618 --> 00:59:10,578
﻿Instead,

616
00:59:10,818 --> 00:59:11,914
You go and give him a beating.

617
00:59:11,938 --> 00:59:12,898
﻿Richi!

618
00:59:13,177 --> 00:59:14,216
﻿After the beating,

619
00:59:14,417 --> 00:59:15,415
﻿Park the car aside.

620
00:59:34,528 --> 00:59:40,805
Open the gates of heaven and
let me serve you, Oh Almighty!

621
00:59:43,415 --> 00:59:48,653
Don't you hear my devout pleas?

622
00:59:51,092 --> 00:59:53,451
Tearing the poster, Out came the hero.

623
00:59:56,890 --> 00:59:57,850
Your attention please!

624
00:59:59,009 --> 01:00:00,647
As the Cuban kid always said

625
01:00:01,489 --> 01:00:02,846
Here we meet once again!

626
01:00:05,127 --> 01:00:06,286
Hey, hey, hey, hey hey!

627
01:00:07,126 --> 01:00:08,164
Down, down, down, down.

628
01:00:11,445 --> 01:00:12,404
Now vou may ask me,

629
01:00:12,884 --> 01:00:14,043
Who is this Cuban kid?

630
01:00:14,603 --> 01:00:15,563
﻿Well,

631
01:00:15,682 --> 01:00:17,041
There is a little story behind it.

632
01:00:18,921 --> 01:00:20,440
When I was in the Bombay remand home,

633
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:22,519
There was this legend.

634
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:24,638
The legend of two kids.

635
01:00:25,799 --> 01:00:27,037
﻿A long time ago,

636
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:29,236
A story about two kids in the remand home.

637
01:00:30,237 --> 01:00:32,835
Some called it a myth.

638
01:00:33,716 --> 01:00:37,273
﻿And people like me,
believed it to be a true incident.

639
01:00:41,712 --> 01:00:45,631
Hmmm, the telephone rings a lot here.

640
01:00:46,711 --> 01:00:47,429
﻿Don't worry.

641
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:48,390
I will take care of it.

642
01:00:48,949 --> 01:00:49,909
﻿Back to the story.

643
01:00:50,828 --> 01:00:51,827
﻿The two kids.

644
01:00:52,348 --> 01:00:53,627
One was from Cuba,

645
01:00:54,348 --> 01:00:55,307
﻿The other kid,

646
01:00:55,627 --> 01:00:58,904
﻿He was from a village called Mandva
somewhere in Maharashtra.

647
01:01:04,824 --> 01:01:05,784
﻿Uh oh!

648
01:01:07,103 --> 01:01:08,062
﻿What the hell!

649
01:01:27,334 --> 01:01:28,294
﻿Easy man!

650
01:01:29,414 --> 01:01:30,053
﻿No tension.

651
01:01:30,054 --> 01:01:31,013
﻿He is our friend.

652
01:01:32,932 --> 01:01:35,090
﻿Where was I?
Yes.

653
01:01:37,091 --> 01:01:38,051
﻿The two kids.

654
01:01:42,808 --> 01:01:44,806
Antonio Montano,

655
01:01:46,966 --> 01:01:48,246
What was the other one's name?

656
01:01:48,406 --> 01:01:49,365
﻿Vijay.

657
01:01:49,406 --> 01:01:50,365
﻿Yes

658
01:01:50,885 --> 01:01:53,443
Vijay Dinanath Chauhan.

659
01:01:55,483 --> 01:01:56,443
﻿Wanna smoke?

660
01:01:58,002 --> 01:01:58,962
﻿Okay!

661
01:02:02,361 --> 01:02:04,839
﻿Every morning in the remand home,

662
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,804
﻿Everyone gathered at
this canteen for breakfast.

663
01:02:07,479 --> 01:02:09,637
﻿Whenever this Cuban kid
saw the kid from Mandva,

664
01:02:09,958 --> 01:02:11,637
﻿He smiled and abused him in Spanish.

665
01:02:12,157 --> 01:02:14,475
﻿The Mandva kid never understood a word.

666
01:02:14,757 --> 01:02:16,637
﻿But it happened again...
And again... And again.

667
01:02:17,235 --> 01:02:21,073
﻿Now tell me, If you were in his
shoes, how long would you bear it?

668
01:02:22,153 --> 01:02:26,871
﻿Then one day, the Mandva kid lost his mind, put the
Cuban kid on the ground and started punching him.

669
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:28,790
﻿Daan! Daan! Daan!

670
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:31,090
﻿Punched until he broke the nose open.

671
01:02:33,508 --> 01:02:36,067
﻿Will you keep staring at us or make
yourself useful and go search?

672
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:43,385
﻿So...

673
01:02:44,304 --> 01:02:48,662
﻿The two kids were taken to the warden
and the Mandva kid was asked to explain,

674
01:02:49,063 --> 01:02:50,023
﻿Why he beat him up?

675
01:02:50,781 --> 01:02:52,279
﻿The Mandva kid explained what happened.

676
01:02:52,741 --> 01:02:56,059
﻿The warden then asked the
Cuban kid, why he swore at him?

677
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,820
﻿The Cuban kid abused
again in front of the warden.

678
01:02:59,338 --> 01:03:00,298
﻿But this time,

679
01:03:00,538 --> 01:03:01,857
﻿Not with a smiling face though.

680
01:03:02,177 --> 01:03:03,137
﻿But with a broken nose.

681
01:03:09,455 --> 01:03:10,415
﻿Concentrate!

682
01:03:10,654 --> 01:03:11,773
﻿Now this is the best part.

683
01:03:12,294 --> 01:03:16,851
﻿The warden then realized that the Cuban
kid was only greeting the Mandva kid.

684
01:03:17,811 --> 01:03:19,650
﻿Good Morning!
We meet once again!

685
01:03:20,410 --> 01:03:22,249
﻿It is a Cuban tradition.

686
01:03:23,089 --> 01:03:26,247
﻿The Mandva kid was embarrassed.
Then they became best of friends.

687
01:03:26,608 --> 01:03:29,247
﻿That's the legend.
But that's not the point.

688
01:03:30,087 --> 01:03:31,445
﻿My point is,

689
01:03:32,285 --> 01:03:35,564
﻿Let's rewind to the part where
the Cuban kid is getting punched.

690
01:03:36,364 --> 01:03:39,482
﻿At that moment, What is running
through the Cuban kid's mind?

691
01:03:39,842 --> 01:03:42,041
﻿Put yourself in his shoes.

692
01:03:42,842 --> 01:03:45,839
﻿You are getting punched by a kid,
But you have no clue why he is hitting you.

693
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,782
﻿What would be going on in your mind?

694
01:03:52,358 --> 01:03:53,557
﻿Full confusion, right?

695
01:03:57,396 --> 01:03:59,034
﻿Are you confused?

696
01:04:02,514 --> 01:04:06,872
﻿You have a bag. If you don't
hand it over, I'm gonna shoot you.

697
01:04:08,671 --> 01:04:09,830
﻿I don't have any bag.

698
01:04:10,071 --> 01:04:14,668
﻿You do. If you don't give it, I'm gonna
take it anyway, along with your life.

699
01:04:15,029 --> 01:04:17,427
﻿I'm telling the truth.
There is no bag.

700
01:04:17,828 --> 01:04:20,026
﻿ls it? Okay.

701
01:04:20,787 --> 01:04:25,304
﻿We'll find the bag.
And then we'll shoot you.

702
01:04:27,025 --> 01:04:27,984
﻿Got it.

703
01:04:29,903 --> 01:04:30,862
﻿Good!

704
01:04:31,183 --> 01:04:32,221
﻿Now it's time to shoot you.

705
01:04:32,942 --> 01:04:34,020
﻿But the bag is empty.

706
01:04:34,261 --> 01:04:37,819
﻿Huh? Empty?
There must be something.

707
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:39,411
﻿Have you brought an empty bag?

708
01:04:40,979 --> 01:04:41,939
﻿Alright.

709
01:04:42,338 --> 01:04:45,016
﻿We'll have a look in the
bag once we shoot you.

710
01:04:45,497 --> 01:04:46,457
﻿Now, I'll shoot you.

711
01:04:48,616 --> 01:04:49,815
﻿Before I shoot you,

712
01:04:50,375 --> 01:04:52,102
﻿Why was I telling you
the story of those kids?

713
01:04:54,333 --> 01:04:55,293
﻿You don't know?

714
01:04:55,773 --> 01:04:56,732
﻿How did it start?

715
01:04:58,692 --> 01:05:00,251
﻿Come on. Don't spoil it now.

716
01:05:00,772 --> 01:05:02,849
﻿What did I say when I
entered through that door?

717
01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:05,209
﻿Your attention please.

718
01:05:05,769 --> 01:05:06,729
﻿After that?

719
01:05:10,847 --> 01:05:12,006
﻿Tell me fast!

720
01:05:12,407 --> 01:05:13,525
﻿Are you on mute?

721
01:05:13,966 --> 01:05:14,964
﻿What did I say after that?

722
01:05:15,525 --> 01:05:16,485
﻿We meet once again.

723
01:05:16,765 --> 01:05:17,724
﻿What does it mean?

724
01:05:17,964 --> 01:05:19,522
﻿We meet once again.

725
01:05:21,243 --> 01:05:25,200
﻿Exactly! You B@$rarD!
We meet once again.

726
01:05:27,961 --> 01:05:30,399
﻿We meet once again after 15 years!

727
01:05:37,437 --> 01:05:38,397
﻿Richi?

728
01:05:39,196 --> 01:05:42,234
﻿Oh! So you remember Richi!

729
01:05:43,235 --> 01:05:44,793
﻿You B@$tarD, $On OF A BitcA!

730
01:05:45,034 --> 01:05:47,792
﻿Look at your face.
It's a sight to watch.

731
01:05:48,472 --> 01:05:50,791
﻿Look at his face. Sweating like a pig.

732
01:05:53,311 --> 01:05:54,788
﻿So you remember Richi?

733
01:05:55,430 --> 01:05:56,508
﻿How can I forget you?

734
01:05:56,949 --> 01:05:59,587
﻿What? You $0n OF A BitcA!

735
01:06:00,068 --> 01:06:03,522
﻿You've returned to Udupt after 15 years. Why
didn't you let your best friend know about it?

736
01:06:04,266 --> 01:06:06,784
﻿It's not like that. I was
supposed to meet you all.

737
01:06:07,705 --> 01:06:10,982
﻿But...
So I heard you met your mother last night.

738
01:06:12,503 --> 01:06:13,463
﻿Oh, you know?

739
01:06:14,142 --> 01:06:16,821
﻿Are you taking her to Dubai?
Won't you take me along?

740
01:06:18,341 --> 01:06:19,300
﻿Alright.

741
01:06:20,579 --> 01:06:23,378
﻿Take your bag.
You are coming with us.

742
01:06:23,818 --> 01:06:27,096
﻿Sorry. I've promised mom that
I'll be coming home for dinner.

743
01:06:27,457 --> 01:06:29,300
﻿Fine. I'll drop you home
by evening. Now come on.

744
01:06:30,137 --> 01:06:31,374
﻿Come on now.

745
01:06:32,975 --> 01:06:33,934
﻿Get him along.

746
01:06:38,613 --> 01:06:40,171
﻿I'm sorry about breaking the door.

747
01:06:41,492 --> 01:06:47,768
﻿I have a small job to do. If you don't mind
You enjoy the sea breeze. I will finish my job.

748
01:06:58,365 --> 01:06:59,324
﻿Hey Sudhi! Stop the boat.

749
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:16,037
﻿Hey A$$h0l3!
So you want Shankaranna's money, eh?

750
01:07:18,718 --> 01:07:20,475
﻿So you're a tiger, eh?

751
01:07:32,472 --> 01:07:34,390
﻿When a dog gets high it eats its own shit.

752
01:07:34,911 --> 01:07:35,949
﻿Deceitful B@$tarD!

753
01:07:38,110 --> 01:07:39,069
﻿Are you a real tiger?

754
01:07:46,506 --> 01:07:48,664
Let me hear you roar like a tiger.

755
01:07:52,504 --> 01:07:54,343
Don't whine like a dog.

756
01:07:54,663 --> 01:07:56,102
Tiger! Roar like a tiger.

757
01:08:00,461 --> 01:08:01,939
Louder! I cant hear you.

758
01:08:06,099 --> 01:08:08,457
Roar properly you $On OF A BitcA!

759
01:08:12,616 --> 01:08:14,334
Nah! It's not a real tiger.

760
01:08:15,894 --> 01:08:17,200
It's a dog under the tiger's skin.

761
01:08:30,609 --> 01:08:34,127
﻿Is it enough?
Everything under control?

762
01:08:35,327 --> 01:08:36,286
﻿Just a simple lesson.

763
01:08:38,086 --> 01:08:40,724
﻿Nah! Our tiger needs more.

764
01:08:42,244 --> 01:08:45,522
﻿Our tiger...
needs to earn some more lessons.

765
01:08:50,361 --> 01:08:56,798
﻿Are you confused?
Nah! You are not confused.

766
01:08:57,758 --> 01:09:04,035
﻿Our tiger is not confused. Because...
Our tiger knows why I'm hitting him.

767
01:09:17,755 --> 01:09:18,714
﻿That's the house.

768
01:09:43,864 --> 01:09:45,703
﻿Shailesha, What are you doing here?

769
01:09:45,944 --> 01:09:49,980
﻿Nothing Ratnakka.
Just waiting for a friend.

770
01:10:20,411 --> 01:10:23,408
﻿Chapter 3 Fish Curry.

771
01:10:33,605 --> 01:10:39,242
﻿Fish Auction at the harbor.

772
01:10:42,482 --> 01:10:45,639
﻿She is in her prime now
and not getting any younger.

773
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,798
﻿Ratnakka, how much
did you pay for the fish?

774
01:10:50,078 --> 01:10:51,038
﻿Will you sell it for 180?

775
01:10:51,558 --> 01:10:52,996
﻿I bought it for 200.

776
01:10:53,077 --> 01:10:54,396
﻿How about 190?

777
01:10:54,636 --> 01:10:56,635
﻿Don't you get it? We paid 200!

778
01:10:57,715 --> 01:11:00,753
﻿She has an elder brother,
but he is busy drinking.

779
01:11:00,794 --> 01:11:02,432
﻿Ratnakka, thats my final offer.

780
01:11:02,473 --> 01:11:04,031
﻿Do you think I'm selling peanuts?

781
01:11:05,633 --> 01:11:07,630
﻿Akka, are these new rings?

782
01:11:13,029 --> 01:11:14,628
﻿She paid 375.

783
01:11:18,228 --> 01:11:19,465
﻿Are these fresh?

784
01:11:19,787 --> 01:11:21,225
﻿We would've got it for 340.

785
01:11:21,866 --> 01:11:25,823
﻿She let it pass. I kept pinching her A$$.
When has she ever listened to me?

786
01:11:26,464 --> 01:11:29,022
﻿How was I suppose to know
that the boats would be late today?

787
01:11:29,703 --> 01:11:31,353
﻿Didn't I bargain for a
good price yesterday?

788
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:38,620
﻿What is she up to?

789
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:41,057
﻿New job, thus the excitement.

790
01:11:41,298 --> 01:11:42,497
﻿This basket is already counted.

791
01:11:43,137 --> 01:11:45,616
﻿Hey Anita, How many
fish are there in this basket?

792
01:11:46,736 --> 01:11:48,134
﻿Tell me, How many in this basket?

793
01:11:48,375 --> 01:11:49,934
﻿Arrgh! I lost my count now.

794
01:11:50,095 --> 01:11:51,333
﻿Why are you counting?

795
01:11:51,534 --> 01:11:52,933
﻿Don't you want to share?

796
01:11:53,014 --> 01:11:55,251
﻿Who told you that we count and share?

797
01:11:55,533 --> 01:11:57,691
﻿Silly girl! Get up!

798
01:11:58,412 --> 01:12:00,330
﻿Counting! My A$$!

799
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:10,606
﻿Hello Ratnakka.

800
01:12:11,567 --> 01:12:13,085
﻿How is the business today?

801
01:12:13,286 --> 01:12:14,965
﻿As usual. You want fish?

802
01:12:14,966 --> 01:12:16,123
﻿What do you have?

803
01:12:16,124 --> 01:12:17,643
﻿Lady fish, mackerel.

804
01:12:17,844 --> 01:12:19,322
﻿Don't you have sardines?

805
01:12:19,323 --> 01:12:20,602
﻿No sardines today.

806
01:12:20,643 --> 01:12:21,562
﻿Do you want Clams?

807
01:12:21,563 --> 01:12:23,002
﻿No. How much for the lady fish?

808
01:12:23,322 --> 01:12:25,960
﻿As usual. 5 fish for 30 rupees.

809
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:32,357
﻿My god! That's expensive. Maybe omorrow.

810
01:12:32,438 --> 01:12:33,917
﻿Will get Sardines tomorrow.

811
01:12:41,355 --> 01:12:44,752
﻿Just 4 left. I'll give all the
fish for an extra 10 rupees.

812
01:12:45,513 --> 01:12:51,150
﻿We are just four people. I've already bought
more and the children don't even like mackerel.

813
01:12:51,911 --> 01:12:53,549
﻿Where will I sell these?

814
01:12:53,950 --> 01:12:56,988
﻿Ratnakka, Do you know
this other girl who sells fish?

815
01:12:58,588 --> 01:13:00,026
﻿She is very pretty.

816
01:13:01,707 --> 01:13:02,666
﻿Who is she talking about?

817
01:13:02,906 --> 01:13:03,866
﻿Must be Sharada.

818
01:13:03,906 --> 01:13:07,944
﻿Yes. Who Is that guy
following her around on the bike?

819
01:13:08,104 --> 01:13:11,742
﻿Oh that guy! He is not from here.

820
01:13:12,303 --> 01:13:15,140
﻿He is from across the mountains.
He works at the harbor.

821
01:13:15,782 --> 01:13:18,739
﻿Following her post
noon is his daily routine.

822
01:13:20,699 --> 01:13:22,476
﻿Akka, Do you want the
head or shall I throw them?

823
01:13:22,499 --> 01:13:25,936
﻿Nobody eats the head.
We feed it to the dog.

824
01:13:39,652 --> 01:13:41,330
﻿Ratnakka, Early today?

825
01:13:41,331 --> 01:13:43,570
﻿Early? Its already dark.

826
01:13:45,489 --> 01:13:46,528
﻿Get inside.

827
01:13:53,687 --> 01:13:55,325
﻿Akka, any fish left?

828
01:13:55,486 --> 01:13:56,685
﻿Sorry. Everything is sold.

829
01:13:56,686 --> 01:14:00,043
﻿Oh okay. I thought of taking
some home if there were any fish left.

you once before he died.

852
01:18:31,777 --> 01:18:37,414
﻿How foolish of me. I didn't
even ask you for dinner.

853
01:18:39,574 --> 01:18:42,013
﻿It's okay. Don't worry about it.

854
01:18:42,414 --> 01:18:46,650
﻿I know you like fish curry. I will
cook quickly. Eat a little before you go.

855
01:18:48,971 --> 01:18:53,648

I will get some from the neighbor.

856
01:18:53,889 --> 01:18:55,048
﻿Mom, I have to go.

857
01:18:57,048 --> 01:18:58,606

01:19:06,084 --> 01:19:07,203
﻿Will you come with me?

860
01:19:08,963 --> 01:19:10,802
﻿Who do I have to call my own but you?

861
01:19:11,162 --> 01:19:15,879
﻿I am going to Dubai the day after tomorrow.
I'll take you there. Will you come with me?

862
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:19,398
﻿To Dubai?

863
01:19:19,758 --> 01:19:22,196
﻿Yes. We can be a family again.

864
01:19:28,155 --> 01:19:29,394
﻿Are you telling the truth?

865
01:19:32,474 --> 01:19:34,192
﻿Will you really take me?

866
01:19:37,352 --> 01:19:39,390
﻿Then I'll come along with
you the day after tomorrow.

867
01:19:39,551 --> 01:19:42,150
﻿You'll need a passport to travel.

868
01:19:42,350 --> 01:19:45,788
﻿It'll at least take a month.
I can't stay here for long.

869
01:19:51,387 --> 01:19:54,385
﻿Mom. Take this money.

870
01:19:55,745 --> 01:19:58,982
﻿My friend will take you to Bangalore
and help you with the passport.

871
01:19:59,943 --> 01:20:03,541
﻿Once it is ready, I will send you tickets.

872
01:20:03,941 --> 01:20:05,460
﻿He'll take you to Dubai.

873
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:09,178
﻿Why can't you come and take me along?

874
01:20:09,219 --> 01:20:15,976
﻿I can't explain.
Anyway, I'll have to leave now.

875
01:20:16,776 --> 01:20:18,775
﻿Please stay home tonight.

876
01:20:21,735 --> 01:20:23,372
﻿At least have some dinner!

877
01:20:25,333 --> 01:20:29,370
﻿I don't know when I'll see you again.

878
01:20:32,370 --> 01:20:34,768
﻿Alright Mom, I'll come for dinner tomorrow.

879
01:20:36,329 --> 01:20:42,165
﻿I will cook your favorite fish curry.

880
01:20:42,326 --> 01:20:44,565
﻿It's been ages since I had your fish curry.

881
01:20:45,645 --> 01:20:47,163
﻿Fine. I will go now.

882
01:21:04,918 --> 01:21:06,556
﻿Ratnakka, Where is your basket?

883
01:21:10,715 --> 01:21:12,153
﻿Are you ill?

884
01:21:14,313 --> 01:21:16,951
﻿My son has returned.

885
01:21:16,952 --> 01:21:17,912
﻿What?

886
01:21:18,353 --> 01:21:19,631
﻿My son is back.

887
01:21:20,071 --> 01:21:24,069
﻿The one who ran away 15
years ago? He came back, huh?

888
01:21:24,070 --> 01:21:25,029
﻿Yes.

889
01:21:25,070 --> 01:21:27,188
﻿﻿Where was he?

890
01:21:27,269 --> 01:21:27,988
﻿Bombay.

891
01:21:28,148 --> 01:21:30,546
﻿What was he doing there for 15 years?

892
01:21:30,708 --> 01:21:32,065
﻿He was working at a hotel.

893
01:21:33,266 --> 01:21:34,865
﻿Oh. He must have made money then.

894
01:21:35,866 --> 01:21:37,343
﻿He is taking me to Dubai.

895
01:21:37,385 --> 01:21:38,464
﻿To Dubai?!!!

896
01:21:40,823 --> 01:21:43,062
﻿So you won't be coming with us anymore.

897
01:21:44,222 --> 01:21:45,660
﻿When are you traveling to Dubai?

898
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:51,059
﻿After a month. You need a passport
to travel. It takes a month.

899
01:21:51,499 --> 01:21:53,338
Is it for preparing
fish curry for your son?

900
01:21:54,498 --> 01:21:59,136
﻿He likes lady fish very much.
I'll leave now. I am getting late.

901
01:21:59,377 --> 01:22:01,894
﻿Ratnakka, Don't forget about
us after you go to Dubai.

902
01:22:02,055 --> 01:22:04,973
Oh Shut up! Drama queen.

903
01:22:04,974 --> 01:22:07,012
﻿Will meet you tomorrow.

904
01:22:11,612 --> 01:22:14,049
Ratnakka, where are you going in a hurry?

905
01:22:14,050 --> 01:22:14,769
﻿My son has returned.

906
01:22:14,792 --> 01:22:16,712
The one who ran away 15 years ago?

907
01:22:18,729 --> 01:22:19,688
Where was he?

908
01:22:19,969 --> 01:22:21,927
It's along story. I'll tell you

909
01:22:21,928 --> 01:22:24,166
Some other time. I'm late already.

910
01:22:25,806 --> 01:22:27,085

956
01:28:22,686 --> 01:28:24,565
﻿I will wear them on alternate days.

957
01:28:25,045 --> 01:28:26,462

01:28:26,485 --> 01:28:28,563
﻿Can't you wear the same one everyday?

959
01:28:28,724 --> 01:28:30,802

have any idea how expensive they are?

01:29:41,936 --> 01:29:42,895
﻿Why?

975
01:29:43,214 --> 01:29:45,019
Send him for a bit.
I have a little job for him.

976
01:29:46,813 --> 01:29:51,051
﻿Listen! Don't waste time
chatting with them. Come back soon.

977
01:29:51,811 --> 01:29:52,771
﻿Go.

﻿Send that small kid to
get the booze. Filthy pigs.

982
01:31:02,024 --> 01:31:03,182
﻿Democracy!

983
01:31:04,623 --> 01:31:05,583
﻿Let's go.

984
01:31:15,260 --> 01:31:15,937
﻿Whats in the carry bag?

985
01:31:16,099 --> 01:31:17,059
﻿Fish.

986
01:31:17,298 --> 01:31:18,258
﻿Why did you get them?

987
01:31:18,857 --> 01:31:20,216
﻿To put them in an aquarium.

988
01:31:21,536 --> 01:31:22,576
﻿They are dead!

989
01:31:22,735 --> 01:31:28,812
﻿Really? Then I will cook
some nice fish fry for you.

990
01:31:30,653 --> 01:31:35,891
﻿Don't feel bad for them. Take a couple of
extra cooked pieces and parcel them to Mandya.

991
01:31:36,371 --> 01:31:37,945
﻿I'll smash your face, you li'l scoundrel!

992
01:31:39,850 --> 01:31:41,408
﻿Why did those 3 monkeys call you?

993
01:31:41,969 --> 01:31:45,686
﻿Those guys? I was teaching
them Gandhian principles.

994
01:31:46,167 --> 01:31:46,646
What principles?

995
01:31:46,887 --> 01:31:54,282
﻿See no evil, hear no evil, talk no evil. They asked
if they can drink evil. I got them a crate myself.

996
01:31:54,364 --> 01:31:56,441
﻿They even gave me 20 rupees.

997
01:32:04,759 --> 01:32:07,877
﻿You stay away from them.
They are not good people.

998
01:32:08,758 --> 01:32:14,995
﻿And no more taking their money.
Wait till I talk to your dad today.

999
01:32:25,111 --> 01:32:26,631
﻿Shall I wear the other one?

1000
01:32:26,951 --> 01:32:28,029
﻿Shut up and sit.

1001
01:32:36,947 --> 01:32:38,665
﻿Will you paint me for tomorrow?

1002
01:32:39,306 --> 01:32:40,266
﻿What painting?

1003
01:32:40,306 --> 01:32:45,663
﻿It's Janmaastami. Think of something
awesome. I should look better than my friends.

1004
01:32:46,343 --> 01:32:47,582
﻿Will you paint me?

1005
01:33:00,938 --> 01:33:04,975
﻿Why do we come here every
afternoon? You don't even buy fish.

1006
01:33:05,616 --> 01:33:06,935
﻿Shut up and follow.

1007
01:33:22,609 --> 01:33:24,168

01:39:58,174 --> 01:40:01,612
Nah! I have better things to do.

1080
01:40:01,933 --> 01:40:04,012
﻿You mean we are good for nothing, huh?

﻿An idle mind is a devil's workshop.

1122
01:43:39,368 --> 01:43:41,086
﻿Shankaranna is very angry with him.

1123
01:43:41,567 --> 01:43:43,294
﻿Why? Is it because he
hasn't shown up at work?

1124
01:43:43,326 --> 01:43:45,324
﻿Shankaranna won't lose
sleep over his absence.

1125
01:43:45,965 --> 01:43:47,283
﻿Then? What did he do?

1126

﻿Munna,

1141
01:44:52,859 --> 01:45:00,536
Boat 98 is giving trouble. I've told
Richi to dock it by 4 pm. Have a look.

1142
01:45:02,055 --> 01:45:06,493
Are the China made engines any good?

1143
01:45:07,454 --> 01:45:11,010
﻿Big engines, so good load capacity.
Very few boats have it in Malpe.

1144
01:45:13,811 --> 01:45:18,807
﻿I've ordered for one.
If it's good we will order for more.

1145
01:45:19,408 --> 01:45:20,847
﻿I'll leave now.

1146
01:45:50,476 --> 01:45:51,035
﻿What happened?

1147
01:45:51,196 --> 01:45:52,634
They took away Balanna.

1148
01:45:52,657 --> 01:45:53,252
Who?

1149
01:45:53,275 --> 01:45:56,913
Richi and his friends. They beat him badly.
Balanna was bleeding all over.

1150
01:45:57,193 --> 01:45:58,921
﻿When did this happen?
Where did they take him?

1151
01:45:59,313 --> 01:46:01,391
This afternoon.
I don't know where hey took him.

1152
01:46:06,190 --> 01:46:08,028

1195
01:51:05,653 --> 01:51:08,011
﻿Do it quickly.

1196
01:51:11,970 --> 01:51:14,049
﻿Do you see any blood stains?
No Anna.

1197
01:51:24,406 --> 01:51:26,205
I'm still tired with all that dancing.

1198
01:51:32,962 --> 01:51:36,240
Look at Sudhi. Killing time.

1199
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:39,799
﻿Where is that B@$tarD. He had a
lot to talk at Shankaranna's house.

1200
01:51:44,958 --> 01:51:47,196
Hey Sudhi, start the vehicle.

1201
01:51:49,676 --> 01:51:51,515
﻿All he does is chase women.

1202
01:52:19,024 --> 01:52:24,781
﻿Don't get that any closer.
I beg you, just let me be.

1203
01:52:25,582 --> 01:52:27,558
﻿I don't want to talk about that.
Please leave me alone.

1204
01:52:27,581 --> 01:52:30,219
﻿Just a few minutes.
I won't trouble you much.

1205
01:52:32,579 --> 01:52:33,777
﻿Please understand!

1206
01:52:33,778 --> 01:52:39,655
﻿The trouble you are causing is more than
enough. I'm an ordinary man. What'll I know?

1207
01:52:40,456 --> 01:52:44,814
﻿- Please don't drag me into this.
- I'll make sure to protect your identity.

1208
01:52:45,095 --> 01:52:50,851
﻿Arrghhhh! Please leave me alone.
I'm already fed up in life!

1209
01:52:51,452 --> 01:52:57,408
﻿First it was the police and then that lawyer. As
if that wasn't enough, now you want my interview!

1210
01:52:59,769 --> 01:53:05,325
See, Everyone is looking at us.
What will they think of me?

1211
01:53:09,445 --> 01:53:14,601
﻿Arrgh! Bloody crow! All
this mess is because of you!

1212
01:53:15,243 --> 01:53:18,081
﻿You are the main reason.
I'm gonna kill you today!

1213
01:53:20,240 --> 01:53:22,398
You B@$TarD!
Disgusting crow!

1214
01:53:28,956 --> 01:53:33,394
﻿Hey! What are you doing? She is a girl.
How willl you say no to her?

1215
01:53:33,716 --> 01:53:37,153
﻿She is just asking for an interview.
Talk to her.

1216
01:53:37,314 --> 01:53:38,792
﻿Hey Koraga, Mind your own business.

1217
01:53:39,714 --> 01:53:41,791
﻿If you so wanna talk to her,
go give the interview.

1218
01:53:42,352 --> 01:53:44,151
﻿Don't tell me what to do.

1219
01:53:44,631 --> 01:53:47,389
﻿﻿Come on! Leave me! Come on, Let me go!

1220
01:53:47,590 --> 01:53:48,818
﻿She is a girl, you can't say no.

1221
01:53:48,950 --> 01:53:51,387
﻿She has promised not
to disclose your name too.

1222
01:53:51,628 --> 01:53:56,305
﻿So what if she discloses my name?
I'm not afraid of anyone. I don't care!

1223
01:53:56,306 --> 01:54:00,144
﻿Sit down now. Hey kid bring a chair

1224
01:54:03,104 --> 01:54:04,382
﻿Please come inside.

1225
01:54:10,940 --> 01:54:12,379
﻿Please sit down.

1226
01:54:17,738 --> 01:54:19,336
﻿Ask whatever you want now.

1227
01:54:19,337 --> 01:54:20,336
﻿I will answer all your questions.

1228
01:54:20,337 --> 01:54:23,774
﻿B@$tarD, What do you know?
Sit quietly. I'll talk.

1229
01:54:31,173 --> 01:54:32,132
﻿Do you see that crow?

1230
01:54:33,332 --> 01:54:35,290
﻿That B@$tarD crow!

1231
01:54:36,531 --> 01:54:39,569
﻿It's been following me
since I got that thing.

1232
01:54:40,289 --> 01:54:41,249
﻿What thing?

1233
01:54:55,443 --> 01:54:56,122
﻿What is it?

1234
01:54:56,163 --> 01:54:57,122
﻿Shhhh!

1235
01:54:57,841 --> 01:54:58,916
﻿You shouldn't take its name.

1236
01:54:59,521 --> 01:55:00,920
﻿It is a bad omen, a curse.

1237
01:55:01,720 --> 01:55:04,078
﻿It has ruined all its owners’ lives.

1238
01:55:05,039 --> 01:55:07,398
﻿I found it while fishing at the sea.

1239
01:55:08,198 --> 01:55:09,397
﻿What does it look like?

1240
01:55:20,153 --> 01:55:21,792
﻿It was raining heavily that night.

1241
01:55:22,633 --> 01:55:28,750
﻿Five people could not pull the net that day. I joined
and so did Seena. It took seven people to haul the net.

1242
01:55:56,379 --> 01:55:59,538
﻿As we untied the net, we found a
huge log of wood in the midst of the fish.

1243
01:56:15,612 --> 01:56:18,730
﻿For some reason, I couldn't discard it.

1244
01:56:31,846 --> 01:56:34,324
﻿I got it home along with me.

1245
01:56:48,559 --> 01:56:53,716
﻿That night the bird was crowing non stop.
It sounded like a brass band inside my ears.

1246
01:57:09,031 --> 01:57:16,307
﻿shoo! Shoo! Go away.
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

1247
01:57:25,345 --> 01:57:28,982
﻿Hey! Go away.
Shoo! Shoo!

1248
01:57:28,983 --> 01:57:35,619
﻿The crow did not leave with all my efforts. I
realized the crow had followed me from the sea.

1249
01:57:36,540 --> 01:57:41,097
﻿It did not stop crowing.
It had its eyes fixed on the piece of wood.

1250
01:58:00,451 --> 01:58:03,809
﻿I couldn't bear it anymore and
threw the log towards the crow.

1251
01:58:04,330 --> 01:58:12,006
﻿The log split and I see the
most beautiful thing in my life!

1252
01:58:19,243 --> 01:58:22,881
﻿Gold. It shined as bright as gold!

1253
01:58:31,279 --> 01:58:32,758
﻿It is very precious.

1254
01:58:33,718 --> 01:58:36,555
﻿It's in huge demand
outside our own country too.

1255
01:58:37,636 --> 01:58:39,434
﻿Do you know how much
they were ready to pay?

1256
01:58:40,115 --> 01:58:41,354
﻿In lakhs, crores.

1257
01:58:42,235 --> 01:58:43,793
﻿You can't imagine. So much money.

1258
01:58:45,073 --> 01:58:50,271
﻿It's a relic. You won't find it anywhere
but in the depths of the ocean.

1259
01:58:50,831 --> 01:58:52,150
﻿So where is it now?

1260
01:58:52,631 --> 01:58:54,868
﻿I sold it to a guy in Bombay.

1261
01:58:55,589 --> 01:58:59,507
﻿That B@$tarD gave me an advance of 10,000 and
promised me to pay 50% of profit after sale.

1262
01:59:00,428 --> 01:59:03,066
﻿But then he calls me
and says that it is stolen.

1263
01:59:04,026 --> 01:59:05,216
﻿Now how does that matter to me?

1264
01:59:05,465 --> 01:59:07,143
﻿Catch the culprit.

1265
01:59:07,584 --> 01:59:08,583
﻿Give me my money.

1266
01:59:08,944 --> 01:59:12,661
﻿He says he can't until he finds that thing.

1267
01:59:13,142 --> 01:59:13,661
﻿Now you tell me,

1268
01:59:14,102 --> 01:59:16,300
﻿How do I trust these
guys with so much money?

1269
01:59:19,140 --> 01:59:21,458
﻿Shankar Poojary was after it too.

1270
01:59:22,499 --> 01:59:26,896
﻿He had sent that Richi, to find out
where I had sent it in Bombay.

1271
01:59:27,256 --> 01:59:28,600
﻿But Shankar Poojary told me that...

1272
01:59:28,696 --> 01:59:30,174
﻿I was selling his fish in the market.

1273
01:59:31,135 --> 01:59:32,095
﻿$On OF A BitcA!

1274
01:59:32,695 --> 01:59:35,052
﻿Runs an illegal business
and talks about righteousness.

1275
01:59:36,293 --> 01:59:38,852
﻿This Shankar Poojary
has good links in Bombay.

1276
01:59:39,652 --> 01:59:41,410
﻿You just can't trust him with anything.

1277
01:59:43,570 --> 01:59:47,848
﻿This bloody crow doesn't stop.
I'm going to kill it today.

1278
02:00:01,483 --> 02:00:05,242
﻿Chapter 5 Ka.

1279
02:00:05,802 --> 02:00:06,761
﻿Trust me.

1280
02:00:07,481 --> 02:00:10,399
﻿We don't give Bechappas
(scarecrow) their real credits.

1281
02:00:11,600 --> 02:00:19,036
﻿Bechappa has protected our field
day and night from crows and even animals.

1282
02:00:19,716 --> 02:00:24,233
﻿What have we done in return?
Not even a yakshagana act in his name.

1283
02:00:25,514 --> 02:00:26,474
If you ask me,

1284
02:00:26,914 --> 02:00:29,272
﻿We should perform a
Yakshagana act in his name.

1285
02:00:29,793 --> 02:00:30,830
﻿The Chronicles of Bechappa.

1286
02:00:31,272 --> 02:00:32,232
What do you think, huh?

1287
02:00:35,831 --> 02:00:37,519
There is an act on
Krishna & Arjuna's battle.

1288
02:00:37,869 --> 02:00:38,867
﻿Bheeshma's Victory too.

1289
02:00:39,789 --> 02:00:43,826
﻿Has Krishna, Arjuna or Bheeshma
ever saved us from the crow.

1290
02:00:44,107 --> 02:00:46,424
Never! why on earth should
we have acts in their names?

1291
02:00:46,945 --> 02:00:49,424
But Bechappa has always been there for us.

1292
02:00:51,424 --> 02:00:53,302
﻿What do you folks call him?

1293
02:00:55,023 --> 02:00:55,983
﻿Bedaru Gombe.

1294
02:00:56,661 --> 02:00:57,621
﻿Not bad.

1295
02:00:57,662 --> 02:00:59,220
﻿Same looks but different names.

1296
02:01:01,500 --> 02:01:02,460
﻿Hey Balu!

1297
02:01:03,859 --> 02:01:05,257
﻿Come on. Let's paint you waist down.

1298
02:01:06,138 --> 02:01:10,336
﻿In a minute. Don't get on my
nerves now. Paint the rest of them.

1299
02:01:11,416 --> 02:01:13,814
﻿Everyone's almost finished.
You come fast.

1300
02:01:22,531 --> 02:01:23,491
﻿Bedaru Gombe

1301
02:01:25,091 --> 02:01:27,208
﻿Isn't a very ordinary name?

1302
02:01:28,209 --> 02:01:29,822
You should have named
him something strong.

1303
02:01:32,448 --> 02:01:33,484
KrantiVeera (Revolutionary)

1304
02:01:34,047 --> 02:01:35,199
MahaPrachanda (The Tremendous)

1305
02:01:36,287 --> 02:01:37,605
Bedaru Gombe

1306
02:01:38,926 --> 02:01:40,004
Doesn't have a ring to it.

1307
02:01:41,644 --> 02:01:42,604
Trust me.

1308
02:01:43,163 --> 02:01:45,428
﻿You folks over at the western
ghats have no sense in naming.

1309
02:01:46,802 --> 02:01:47,762
﻿Have you gone nuts?

1310
02:01:48,722 --> 02:01:50,800
﻿A scarecrow is a scarecrow.
What else will you call it?

1311
02:01:52,320 --> 02:01:54,438
﻿Don't underestimate our Bechappa.

1312
02:01:55,158 --> 02:01:57,878
﻿Do you know how many sleepless
nights I've had due to that bloody crow?

1313
02:01:58,838 --> 02:02:00,636
﻿It didn't let me sleep or a week.

1314
02:02:01,117 --> 02:02:02,755
﻿I tried to scare it in vain.

1315
02:02:03,276 --> 02:02:05,594
Finally I settled down
near my Saviour, Bechappa.

1316
02:02:06,275 --> 02:02:08,673
﻿That crow did not dare to come
close to me for those 4 days.

1317
02:02:09,193 --> 02:02:12,791
﻿I'm telling you, These crows
are really scared of Bechappa.

1318
02:02:16,750 --> 02:02:17,709
﻿Have a look.

1319
02:02:18,870 --> 02:02:19,830
﻿He is a foreigner.

1320
02:02:20,269 --> 02:02:21,388
﻿That's the guy who is buying it.

1321
02:02:21,389 --> 02:02:22,147
﻿Marsellus Wallace.

1322
02:02:22,229 --> 02:02:23,627
﻿A rich party!

1323
02:02:24,108 --> 02:02:25,626
﻿He was ready to pay in crores!

1324
02:03:02,652 --> 02:03:03,612
﻿Take a few more drags.

1325
02:03:04,652 --> 02:03:05,612
﻿Oh no!

1326
02:03:06,372 --> 02:03:09,609
﻿I can't handle the high.

1327
02:03:10,810 --> 02:03:12,368
﻿How much money is a crore?

1328
02:03:14,447 --> 02:03:16,287
﻿How many zeros does it have?

1329
02:03:19,046 --> 02:03:21,804
﻿You'll see, my Bechappa's
prophecy will come true.

1330
02:03:25,164 --> 02:03:26,602
﻿You B@$tarD!

1331
02:03:27,923 --> 02:03:30,001
﻿Fantasizing about my
sister in my company, huh?

1332
02:03:40,079 --> 02:03:41,076
﻿Tell you the truth,

1333
02:03:41,837 --> 02:03:44,370
﻿These folks from the Western ghats
have no control over themselves.

1334
02:03:59,350 --> 02:04:02,748
﻿The guilty conscience does not
need an accuser. Look at him run.

02:09:11,279 --> 02:09:14,476
﻿Don't whine like a dog.
Tiger! Roar Like tiger.

1356
02:09:23,274 --> 02:09:27,472
﻿Nah! It's not a real tiger.
It's a dog under the tiger's skin.

1357
02:09:37,429 --> 02:09:41,465
﻿Have I ever told you the legend
of the Mandva and the Cuban kid?

1358
02:09:42,826 --> 02:09:46,184
﻿The Cuban kid smiling and abusing
the the Mandva kid in Spanish,

1359
02:09:47,064 --> 02:09:51,661
﻿The Mandva kid dropping him
on the ground and breaking his nose.

1360
02:09:57,380 --> 02:09:58,340
﻿Where is it?

1361
02:09:59,899 --> 02:10:01,258
﻿Yes. Got it!

1362
02:10:05,257 --> 02:10:11,654
﻿When the Mandva kid was punching him, what
was running through the Cuban kid's mind?

1363
02:10:12,534 --> 02:10:13,932
﻿Put yourself in his shoes.

1364
02:10:14,533 --> 02:10:19,051
﻿You are getting punched without a reason,
What will be going on in your mind?

1365
02:10:20,891 --> 02:10:21,930
﻿Full confusion, isn't it?

1366
02:10:23,410 --> 02:10:24,409
﻿Are you confused?

1367
02:10:26,849 --> 02:10:31,046
﻿Nah! You are not confused.

1368
02:10:33,766 --> 02:10:36,484
﻿Our tiger is not confused.

1369
02:10:36,805 --> 02:10:40,043
﻿Because, our tiger
knows why I'm hitting him.

1370
02:11:10,152 --> 02:11:11,111
﻿Are you confused?

1371
02:11:15,110 --> 02:11:16,069
﻿8 years.

1372
02:11:18,348 --> 02:11:19,467
﻿All those years for you.

1373
02:11:22,027 --> 02:11:23,665
﻿Do you know the life in a remand home?

1374
02:11:25,746 --> 02:11:26,706
﻿Hell!

1375
02:11:28,505 --> 02:11:32,502
﻿You ran away so easily!
Did you ever think of me?

1376
02:11:34,662 --> 02:11:35,621
﻿Now die.

1377
02:11:42,379 --> 02:11:44,857
﻿Stop staring and tie him up.

1378
02:11:53,695 --> 02:11:54,655
﻿Richi!

1379
02:11:55,254 --> 02:11:56,214
﻿Check the bag.

1380
02:12:30,159 --> 02:12:31,119
﻿Move aside.

1381
02:12:46,033 --> 02:12:49,870
﻿Final Chapter Reasons.

1382
02:14:00,843 --> 02:14:02,761
﻿Raghu! Raghu!

1383
02:14:05,842 --> 02:14:08,960
﻿Raghu!
Not that way! This way!

1384
02:15:51,360 --> 02:15:53,399
Shankaranna is very angry with him.

1385
02:15:55,758 --> 02:15:59,316
﻿Nothing.
What is it? I will talk to him.

1386
02:16:00,956 --> 02:16:02,435
﻿Hey, Munna.

1387
02:16:06,194 --> 02:16:08,712
﻿- What happened They took away Balanna.
- Who?

1388
02:16:08,713 --> 02:16:12,631
﻿Richi and his friends. They beat him
badly. Balanna was bleeding all over.

1389
02:16:12,872 --> 02:16:14,910
﻿First, find Balu.

1390
02:16:19,110 --> 02:16:23,106
﻿Do you see any blood stains?
Shankaranna is very angry with him.

1391
02:21:40,824 --> 02:21:44,381
﻿Have I ever told you the legend
of the Mandva and the Cuban kid?

1392
02:21:45,142 --> 02:21:46,979
﻿Put yourself in the Cuban kid's shoes.

1393
02:21:48,660 --> 02:21:53,977
﻿lf someone hits you without a reason,
What will be going on in your mind?

1394
02:21:55,138 --> 02:21:59,176
﻿Full confusion, isn't it?
Are you confused now?

1395
02:23:56,770 --> 02:23:59,808
﻿Nobody knows what really happened.

1396
02:24:00,609 --> 02:24:03,807
﻿There was a strange feeling
listening to everyone's version.

1397
02:24:14,964 --> 02:24:21,399
﻿You $On OF A BitcA!
B@$tarD. Bloody crow!

1398
02:24:36,234 --> 02:24:39,313
﻿You feel it is true, yet
different from the other.

1399
02:24:40,552 --> 02:24:43,351
﻿One incident seen through different eyes.

1400
02:24:43,352 --> 02:24:48,629
I guess, the thing was
stolen by Raghu in Bombay.

1401
02:24:49,949 --> 02:24:52,907
﻿He probably had plans to
sell it in Dubai and settle there.

1402
02:24:54,188 --> 02:24:59,425
﻿I told you! Its a bad omen, a curse.
It won't rest until it ruins your life.

1403
02:25:02,944 --> 02:25:08,302
﻿Perspectives. What's right? What's wrong?
What is the truth? Which one is a lie?

1404
02:25:08,462 --> 02:25:11,659
﻿Everything changes when you see
it from a different point of view.

1405
02:25:12,160 --> 02:25:19,838
﻿No, no! Richi didn't kill him. I was there. They
were childhood friends. Why would he kill him?

1406
02:25:20,517 --> 02:25:23,555
So why didn't Raghu
meet his mother that night?

1407
02:25:24,756 --> 02:25:32,031
﻿I'm not sure either. When we were leaving the
farmhouse, he said he had to make an urgent trunk call.

1408
02:25:32,913 --> 02:25:39,588
﻿After the phone call, he was tensed.
He left in the evening to meet his mother.

1409
02:25:40,589 --> 02:25:42,046
﻿I don't know what happened after that.

1410
02:25:42,070 --> 02:25:48,786
﻿He must've returned secretly, probably
because, the Bombay guys found out he was here.

1411
02:25:50,107 --> 02:25:53,383
﻿If he is in Dubai, he will surely call me.

1412
02:25:54,025 --> 02:25:56,183
So how am I supposed
to come to a conclusion?

1413
02:25:56,503 --> 02:26:00,181
﻿In fact, it would be wrong to
tell this story with a conclusion.

1414
02:26:01,142 --> 02:26:06,859
﻿Instead, If every aspect and each
perspective of the story is narrated,

1415
02:26:07,100 --> 02:26:09,377
﻿I believe you'll find your own answers.

1416
02:26:37,688 --> 02:26:43,284
﻿I did not witness this story.
I've chronicled it “As Seen by the Rest"
