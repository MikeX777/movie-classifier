1
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,280
Thank you.

2
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,440
Hall.

3
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,440
<i>Come here, please.</i>

4
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,080
<i>- Sir?
- Come on.</i>

5
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,080
Have a good send-off?

6
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,000
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

7
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,920
Mr. Abrahams gave me a picture -

8
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,120
<i>The Light of the World.</i>

9
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,080
The fellas have given me a set of Guatemalas.

10
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,320
Up to two dollars!

11
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,680
The ones with the parrot
and the pillar on.

12
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,200
Look, sir.

13
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,480
Oh, splendid, splendid.

14
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,880
And, um, what did Mr. Abrahams say to you?

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,080
Told you you were a miserable sinner, I hope.

16
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,040
Mr. Abrahams said I'm never to do anything...

17
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,240
I'd be ashamed to do
in front of my mother.

18
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,200
He said my next school...

19
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,120
will be more like the world.

20
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,040
Did he? Did he?

21
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,240
What's the world like, do you suppose?

22
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,640
Don't know, sir. I'm a boy.

23
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,360
Do you, um, have
any older brothers, Hall?

24
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,280
No, sir. Only Kitty and Ada.

25
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,200
They're my sisters, sir.

26
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,600
No uncles?

27
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,840
No, sir.

28
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,400
There's Dr. Barry.
He knew my father before he died.

29
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,120
So you don't really know
a- a great many grown-up fellows.

30
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,040
No, not really, sir.

31
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,000
Mother keeps a coachman...

32
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,920
and George for the garden.

33
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,840
But of course, you mean gentlemen.

34
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,160
Hall, I'm going to talk to you
for a few moments...

35
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,240
as if I were your father.

36
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,640
It isn't anything your mother could say.

37
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,600
Do you - Do you see?

38
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,560
Your body...

39
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,920
is about to experience
various changes.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,880
Physical changes.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,960
Now, Mr. Abrahams has explained
to you that in the beginning...

42
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,320
"...God created he
man and woman...

43
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,400
that the earth
should be peopled abundantly."

44
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,440
Yes, sir. Sir...

45
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,640
what changes?

46
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,920
I speak, Hall...

47
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,120
of the sacred mystery of sex -

48
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,080
the act of procreation...

49
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,040
<i>between a man and his wife.</i>

50
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,160
<i>The- The procreation indeed...</i>

51
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,080
<i>of all creeping things.</i>

52
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,720
You will discover...

53
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,400
<i>that your membrum virilis-</i>

54
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,320
<i>- That's Latin from vir.
- Vir, sir. It means man, sir.</i>

55
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,120
Very good. Very good.
Um, uh, look.

56
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,040
Uh, this might be easier if I -

57
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,320
That. That -That, um -
That thing.

58
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,840
There. Now, that will...

59
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,520
develop and grow larger.

60
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,480
You see?

61
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,720
<i>And when that happens...</i>

62
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,560
<i>the man lies
very, very close to his wife...</i>

63
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,920
<i>and he puts his membrum virilis...</i>

64
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,920
into her vagina...

65
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,880
<i>thus.</i>

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,400
<i>Then, in due course,
she will bring forth his child.</i>

67
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,400
Seminiferous tubules...

68
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,120
<i>labia major and minor, ducts...</i>

69
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,360
vulva.

70
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,280
<i>That- That is
the very crown oflife, Hall.</i>

71
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,720
God's wondrous purpose.

72
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,800
<i>Your body is his temple.</i>

73
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,520
You must never, ever
pollute that temple.

74
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,720
And when,
as one day I - I'm sure you will...

75
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,600
you fall in love and marry,
you will discover...

76
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,560
to serve and protect a woman...

77
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,640
and have children by her...

78
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,200
is life's chiefest glory.

79
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,640
Yes, sir.

80
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,280
You must never, ever mention
any of this to your mother...

81
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,360
or- or- or indeed to any lady.

82
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,760
And if at your next school
the fellows mention it...

83
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,680
just shut them up.

84
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,600
Tell them you know.

85
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,600
I think I shan't marry.

86
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,280
What?

87
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,840
Look, um, in 10 years to the day...

88
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,720
I invite you and your wife to dine
with me and my wife as our guests.

89
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,680
- What do you say?
- Oh, sir.

90
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,200
Yes. It's a bargain then, is it?

91
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,800
Oh, God. Those infernal designs.

92
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,760
Sir, won't they be all right?
The tide will have covered them by now.

93
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,080
Oh, yes, the rising tide.

94
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,880
<i>I only hope to God he's right...</i>

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,520
<i>by God.</i>

96
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,600
Come, Victoria. Come.

97
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,360
<i>Wagner's utter rubbish.
Fat women with horns on their heads...</i>

98
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,280
<i>singing at the tops of their voices...</i>

99
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,200
<i>about how happy they are to be dying.</i>

100
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,120
<i>It's a horrible noise. And it's unhealthy.</i>

101
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,360
<i>But music is about death. It always has been.</i>

102
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,280
<i>I think he's trying to provoke us.</i>

103
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,240
<i>Go on then, Risley. Enlighten us.</i>

104
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,800
<i>A superior mind wouldn't need enlightening.</i>

105
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,640
<i>Music is the highest of the arts.</i>

106
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,000
<i>It needs no reference to the figurative...</i>

107
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,920
or the corporeal.

108
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,160
It is therefore, of all the arts,
the closest to death.

109
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,080
Wagner's by no means unhealthy.

110
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,040
He's merely expressing
most exactly the state of things.

111
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,760
<i>Help yourselves to potatoes, Hall.
Don't stand on ceremony.</i>

112
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,800
I can't stand music.

113
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,200
Or concert halls.
I don't go in for being superior.

114
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,520
- Don't you? I do.
- Come along, Chapman. You're in need of food.

115
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,120
I expect Lord Risley isn't.

116
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,200
I've put him off with my low talk.

117
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,440
I simply can't think of a reply to that.

118
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,880
<i>What about saying nothing?</i>

119
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,920
Say nothing? Horrible.

120
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,960
He must be mad.

121
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,400
<i>What you do
is more important than what you say.</i>

122
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,840
Your deeds are more important
than your words.

123
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,040
<i>What is the difference?
Words are deeds.</i>

124
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,320
Are you trying to say
that these few minutes talking...

125
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,360
in the dean's rooms
have done nothing for you?

126
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,680
Will you, for instance,
ever forget that you've met me?

127
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,360
You're confusing what is important...

128
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,120
with what is impressive.

129
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,760
Chapman and Hall will always remember
they've met you. Of that I have no doubt.

130
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,760
Exactly. Because of my conversation.

131
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,640
Oh, they'll forget that they were engaged
in the act of eating a cutlet.

132
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,680
At least the cutlet does some good to them.
You do not.

133
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,120
I mean, Dean, that a cutlet
merely influences their subconscious life.

134
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,440
I, by my words,
shape the consciousness.

135
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,800
<i>I am therefore not only
more impressive than the cutlet...</i>

136
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,160
but infinitely more important.

137
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,000
Your dean here dwells in superstitious clouds
of Christian self-righteousness.

138
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,480
Your dean pretends that
only insensate faith is of any significance.

139
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,800
<i>And daily he droops,
soporific, into his soup.</i>

140
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,520
Oh, Risley, shut up.
Come on.

141
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,920
I think if a man has ideas like that...

142
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,400
he should have the courtesy
to keep them to himself.

143
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,360
<i>No, no, no.
On the contrary, one must talk, talk, talk.</i>

144
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,560
<i>It's only by talking
that we shall caper upon the summit.</i>

145
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,120
Otherwise the mountains
will overshadow us.

146
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,960
<i>I'm sure, Hall, you will agree.</i>

147
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,320
Wait.

148
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,360
I'm eager to hear
more of your interesting ideas...

149
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,400
about words and deeds.

150
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,320
My rooms are in Trinity.

151
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,360
And I have a dining club
whose members would...

152
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,640
if I'm not mistaken, interest you.

153
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,200
No need to bring your chum.

154
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,120
Oh, well -

155
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,720
You're not going, are you?

156
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,400
Salutations, Risley.

157
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,880
You've bargained for more
than you've gained.

158
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,960
Risley-

159
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,880
You've, uh -You've bargained
for more than you've gained.

160
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,800
- Salutations.
- Look.

161
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,960
<i>- Come in.
- Hello?</i>

162
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,920
<i>- You're Durham, aren't you?
- Yes.</i>

163
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,200
I was looking for Risley.
You don't know where he is?

164
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,680
He's debating at the Union.

165
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,160
I was just stealing
his "pathetic" symphony.

166
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,600
<i>I'm reading a paper on Tchaikovsky,
but I cannot find the third movement.</i>

167
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,680
If it's here at all,
which I don't think it is.

168
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,680
Fetherstonhaugh's got a Pianola.

169
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,320
I know.
His rooms are directly above mine.

170
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,320
Oh, well, I'll come back with you then.
You're living in college now?

171
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,280
<i>- Beginning my second year.
- I'm third.</i>

172
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,680
<i>I have seen you, though.
Hall, isn't it?</i>

173
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,760
If Risley's not coming,
perhaps I'd better get back.

174
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,760
<i>I didn't know you knew Risley.</i>

175
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,000
He's a dangerous man.

176
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,240
A little of him
certainly goes a very long way.

177
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,320
- You like this music?
- I'm afraid I do, yes.

178
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,200
Sweet water from a foul well,
as they say.

179
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,320
A good waltz is more my style.

180
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,960
<i>Hmm. Mine too, really.</i>

181
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,680
- Thank you. Good night.
- Good night, sir.

182
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,520
Hall.

183
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,240
- Oh! Got your third movement.
- I thought I'd come along with you instead.

184
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,400
- Give me some of those to carry.
- It's all right. I think I've got them.

185
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,320
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.

186
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,280
Give.

187
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,680
Mortarboard.

188
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,960
This bit's supposed to be mad.

189
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,040
Hall.

190
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,320
You -You should be at this end.

191
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,600
You should get as far away
from the machine as you can.

192
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,840
Play it again.
If Fetherstonhaugh doesn't mind, that is.

193
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,640
No, you can't play it again.
It's a - It's a movement.

194
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,320
You have to get right to the end.

195
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,040
Fetherstonhaugh, I think I'm gonna eat
one of your apples.

196
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,680
- Is this Sophocles?
- Mm.

197
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,320
Try reading it for the characters,
rather than the author.

198
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,280
It's much more interesting.

199
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,320
Much too fast, Hall.

200
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,320
Slower. Slower.

201
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,320
There. Otherwise you'll tear it.

202
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,840
This bit isn't as jolly, really, is it?

203
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,800
No.

204
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,520
<i>Appalling vac.</i>

205
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,480
<i>I nearly wrote to you about it.</i>

206
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,920
<i>My mother started flinging the cat about because
I wouldn't go to Communion on Christmas Day.</i>

207
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,960
I mean, I'm unorthodox.
I'm not a Christian.

208
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,000
It was imperative that I made a stand.

209
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,000
It's a difficult question.

210
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,840
<i>Hall, come down to the buttery.</i>

211
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,200
Oh, hello, Durham. Halliday's been given
a case of hock for Christmas.

212
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,480
Reward for good behavior over the vac.
He's asked for us.

213
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,960
<i>I'm sorry, Chapman.
Not now.</i>

214
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,920
- We're fixing something.
- Oh. I see.

215
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,920
Sorry. Well, perhaps
we'll see you later, then.

216
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,280
Have you known Chapman long?

217
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,160
<i>Five years. Here and at school.</i>

218
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,480
Give me a cigarette, would you?

219
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,520
I mean, you've got
a mother and sisters.

220
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,400
All the way through that row
I was thinking what you would have done.

221
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,120
My mother never makes a row about anything.

222
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,200
That's 'cause you've never done anything
she wouldn't approve, I expect.

223
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,880
You never will.

224
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,160
I'm disgusted with mine.

225
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,760
I despise her character.

226
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,920
There. I've told you something
no one else in the world knows.

227
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,440
- Won't tell.
- Tell me about your home life.

228
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,920
Nothing to say.
We just go on.

229
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,120
- Lucky devils.
- Rotten vac, eh?

230
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,480
Yes, it was. Rotten.
Misery and hell.

231
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,400
Ow! That really hurt. Ow!

232
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,080
- Misery and hell, eh?
- Hall, what are you -

233
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,000
No! No, Hall, no.

234
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,080
Please. I've got to go.
Don't be such a fool.

235
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,480
- I've got to go. I said I've got a lecture.
- Why don't you go late again?

236
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,320
Because I can't.

237
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,640
You think I don't think.

238
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,280
But I can tell you I do.

239
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:05,080
<i>"Every human soul has...</i>

00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,760
Omit the reference
to the unspeakable vice of the Greeks.

265
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,680
<i>Ah. Yes, sir.</i>

<i>"The unspeakable vice of the Greeks"?</i>

273
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,240
The hypocrisy of the man.
He ought to lose his fellowship.

274
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,480
<i>- Oh, come on!
- No, as a point of pure scholarship.</i>

275
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,160
All the poor old dean can understand
is the physical act.

276
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,920
- I'm not advocating that.
- Cold as a fish on a marble slab. See?

277
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,760
<i>- Shut up, Risley.
I'm trying to make a serious point...</i>

278
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:24,200
which is that a masculine love
of physical beauty and of moral beauty...

279
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,000
and of the beauty
of the thirst for human knowledge -

280
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:30,480
you omit that and you've omitted
the mainstay of Athenian society.

281
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,680
<i>It's as if our benighted dean
hadn't even read The Symposium.</i>

282
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,120
<i>- You read it, Hall?
- No, no, you missed the point.</i>

283
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,080
You have to maintain
some standards of decency.

284
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,840
<i>No, you don't.
Not if they're propped up by tenth-hand opinion.</i>

285
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,560
<i>- Typical of you, I may say.
- Western civilization...</i>

286
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,680
happens to be run on the principles
of Christ's doctrines, not Plato's bloody essences.

287
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,160
What exactly do you mean by Christ's doctrines?
They're open to all sorts of interpretations.

288
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,200
You know: The redemption, the Trinity.

289
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,280
<i># Three in one #</i>

290
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,920

# Hear us while #

293
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,120
Damn Christ's doctrines.
I can't prove them...

294
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,560
but they mean a lot to millions of people,
whatever you say.

295
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,840
# Holy Child and Son ##

296
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,160
<i># Thou shalt open my lips, O Lord #</i>

297
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:29,240
<i>- Hall.
- #And my mouth shall show thy praise #</i>

298
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:34,760
# For thou desirest no sacrifice #

299
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,360
# Else would I #

300
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,560
<i># Give it #</i>

301
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,040
<i># Thee #</i>

302
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,440
# But thou delightest not #

# In burnt offerings ##

304
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,640
- That was enormously embarrassing.
- I did actually say 6:00.

305
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,760
You just made me
walk out of chapel.

306
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,160
<i>I just don't understand it.</i>

307
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,800
<i>- Your father always went to church.
- I can't help it, Mother.</i>

308
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm made that way.
There's no use arguing.

309
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,560
<i>Durham.
I wonder if that's Alicia Durham's brother.</i>

310
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,680
<i>- Besides, I'm not my father.
- Morrie.</i>

311
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,040
- What a thing to say.
- Well, he isn't. Really, Mother, come on.

312
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,400
Kitty, we are talking
about things not suited...

313
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,360
and you are perfectly wrong, besides.

314
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,520
Morrie is the image of his father.

315
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,520
Dr. Barry said so.

316
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,200
Dr. Barry doesn't go to church himself.

317
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,880
<i>Dr. Barry is a most clever man,
and so is Mrs. Barry.</i>

318
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,880
Imagine Mrs. Barry being a man.

319
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,680
Have you been all right?

320
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,440
Have you?

321
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,120
No.

322
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,160
You wrote that you were.

323
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,880
<i>- Hall.!
- Here!</i>

324
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,480
We want tea! We need tea!
We demand tea! Hello, Durham.

325
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,080
<i>A glorious match. We're absolute heroes.</i>

326
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,880
- Peterhouse are abject.
- And wonderful wicketkeeping.

327
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,880
Don't you have any Darjeeling, Hall?
I don't like this Chinese bilge.

328
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,520
Marvelous match.
Best so far.

329
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,880
If it hadn't been for my two valiant
catches in the slips -

330
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,480
Three wickets. Just dropping them
into the rough spot. It was too easy.

331
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,120
Hall. Hall.

332
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,880
- Durham. Where did you get to?
- I know you read those books in the vac.

333
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,240
- How do you mean?
- You'll understand then. I don't have to explain.

334
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,720
- Understand what?
- That I love you.

335
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,320
Don't talk rubbish.

336
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,560
Durham?
Durham, come back!

337
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,920
Come on, old man.

338
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,560
<i>Benedic, Domine, nobis...</i>

339
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,000

342
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,520
<i>a te nutriti.</i>

343
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,040
Tibi debitum obsequium
praestare valeamus...

344
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,440
per Christum Dominum nostrum.

345
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,520
Amen.

346
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,440
Perhaps you could get Hall here.

347
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,280
<i>Clive, you're bloody hard.</i>

348
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,640
You don't know what it is to have
a mind in a mess. It makes you very hard.

349
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,080
<i>Hall, don't be so stupid. You must know
that to be alone with you hurts me.</i>

350
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,760
- I only want to discuss -
- No, please don't reopen it. It's over.

351
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,000
<i>I'm in hell.</i>

352
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,760
You'll get out.
It's only disgust.

353
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,080
You haven't done anything
to be ashamed of.

354
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,200
You don't know
what hell's really like.

355
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,440
I thought it was
the worst crime in the calendar.

356
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,840
The one subject
absolutely beyond the limit.

357
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,520
<i>Look, you've been thoroughly decent
from first to last.</i>

358
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,600
So decent that I mistook
your friendliness.

359
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,000
I thought it was... something else.

360
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,240
I'm sorry to have insulted you.

361
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,080
Durham, I love you...
in my very own way.

362
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,280
Rubbish! As you so rightly said.
Good night.

363
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,640
<i>I do.
I think I have always.</i>

364
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,080
Look.

365
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:59,040
It's like the good, blundering creature
that you are to try to comfort me...

366
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,400
but there are limits.

367
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,680
I'm thankful that it was
into your hands I fell.

368
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,760
Most men would have reported me
to the dean... or the police.

369
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,800
Damn you, Durham.

370
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,400
<i>Maurice.</i>

371
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,000
- I love you.
- I love you.

372
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,160
Hall.

373
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,160
- It's the dean.
- Lord!

374
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,880
- Don't you have a lecture?
- I overslept!

375
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,560
Hall! Stop when I speak to you!

376
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,640
Do you realize...

377
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,560
I -

378
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,800
I would have
gone through life half-awake...

379
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,040
if you'd had the decency
to leave me alone?

380
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,600
Why me?

381
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,400
Perhaps we woke up each other.

382
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,520
- No.
- Can't you kiss me?

383
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,480
I think-
I think it would bring us -

384
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,240
I think it would bring us down.

385
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,560
I think it would spoil everything.

386
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,360
This harmony.

387
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,280
Body...

388
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,760
mind, soul.

389
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,000
I don't think women have even guessed.

390
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,280
But you know.

391
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,960
<i>Why did you not stop when I called you?</i>

392
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,320
Yesterday you cut chapel,
four lectures...

393
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,880
including my own translation class.

394
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,080
And, Hall, you've done
this sort of thing before.

395
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,480
<i>It's unnecessary to add impertinence,
don't you think?</i>

396
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,080
Very well.
I'm sending you down.

397
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,600
You will catch the 12:00.

398
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,040
<i>Unless you write me a letter of apology,
I shall not recommend...</i>

399
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,960
your readmission
to college in October.

400
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,320
If it had been a girl in the sidecar,
Cornwallis would never have kicked up a stink.

401
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,400
Everyone cuts lectures.

402
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,320
I've done nothing wrong.

403
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,080
- I refuse to say that I have.
- What'll you do?

404
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,400
Go into the stock market
like Father did.

405
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,240
I don't need one of
their rotten degrees.

406
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,960
You will come to Pendersleigh?

407
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,600
Good-bye!

408
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,600
Boo-hoo-hoo!

409
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,800
<i>Not quite what you expected, eh?</i>

410
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,440
Dr. Barry, not quite as anyone expected.

411
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:52,440
Still, these past few weeks,
it's become apparent to me that...

412
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,160
it's time a man was here
to head this household again.

413
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,560
Well, it's all for the best.

414
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:02,320
What do you want with a degree?
They were never meant for the suburban classes.

415
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,840
I mean, you're not going to become a parson
or a barrister or a pedagogue...

416
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,440
and you're not a -
you're not a country gentleman.

417
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:13,000
No, it's a sheer waste of time.
The city's your place.

418
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,640
Absolutely right to insult the dean.

419
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,520
If anything,
I've been insulted by him.

420
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,520
<i>Treated like a schoolboy.</i>

421
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,320
You see, your mother
doesn't understand how you feel.

422
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,600
She's worried
because you don't apologize.

423
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,800
To my mind, these things
work themselves out.

424
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,040
You see, you've got yourself
into an atmosphere...

425
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,120
for which you were not suited...

426
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,920
and you very properly
took the first chance to get out.

427
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,360
- How do you mean?
- Oh, still not clear?

428
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,400
I mean that a gentleman
would have apologized by instinct...

429
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,560
if he'd found
that he'd behaved as you did.

430
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:53,240
- I think it's time I turned in.
- How dare you bully your mother, Maurice.

431
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,480
You ought to be horsewhipped.

432
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,040
Swaggering about instead of
begging her to forgive you.

433
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,480
She comes to me with tears in her eyes
and asks me to say something.

434
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,360
- But -
- Don't answer me, sir. I want none of your speech.

435
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,720
<i>- You're a disgrace to chivalry.
- Oh!</i>

436
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,920
<i>I'm disappointed
and disgusted with you.</i>

437
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,400
<i>Oh, Morrie darling,
we all looked forward so much to May Week.</i>

438
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,720
Mother, do stop crying.
It'll only make him think he's important.

439
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,320
He'll write to the dean
as soon as no one wants him to.

440
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,040
- Kitty, I won't.
- I don't see why you shouldn't.

441
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,480
Little girls don't see a great deal.

442
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,720
<i>I see a great deal more than some little boys
who think they're little men.</i>

443
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,120
- Mrs. Sheepshanks.
- Oh, how very complimentary.

444
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,280
Thank you so much.
Skeggs. Olivia.

445
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,560
- Woolly, dear.
- I think everyone should curtsy, don't you?

446
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,040
I've had such an interesting talk
with Mr. Hall.

447
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,120
- And isn't Clive handsome?
- Mother, this is Maurice Hall.

448
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,240
- Welcome to Pendersleigh, Mr. Hall.
- How do you do?

449
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,880
- Woolly.
- Yes, it's so lovely to see you.

450
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
No, leave those.
Come on.

451
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,200
Oh, by the way,
if my mother or my sister...

452
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,600
ask you to do this or that
tomorrow, don't worry.

453
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,520
Say yes if you want, but you're actually
going to ride with me, and they know it.

454
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,360
- It's just their ritual.
- But I haven't brought any riding breeches.

455
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,600
Ah. Well, I can't associate
with you in that case.

456
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,000
Deep breath.

457
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,240
You must be Mr. Hall.

458
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,320
- I'm Pippa Durham, Clive's sister.
- Yes, he's -

459
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,440
May I introduce Mr. London?
Mr. Hall.

460
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,480
- How do you do? Archie London.
- How do you do?

461
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,920
I'm the lucky devil who's to marry her.

462
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,920
<i>I'm commandeering troops
for canvassing tomorrow. Tariff reform.</i>

463
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,840
<i>- Yes. Stop bullying, Pippa.
- Are you interested?</i>

464
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,840
<i>- Certainly. I'd be delighted.
- Good. There, Mama.</i>

465
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,960
<i>Mr. Hall is sound.</i>

466
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,240
- Pippa, dear, does Mr. Hall know his room?
- The Blue Room, Mama.

467
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,240
The Blue Room?
Poor man.

468
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,160
<i>The one with the smoking fireplace. Simcox.</i>

469
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,720
- Where'd you come from?
- The old schoolroom, our study.

470
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,200
That's why you've been put to stay
in this dog's misery.

471
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,320
<i>Come.</i>

472
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,480
<i>It's as much like college as I could make it.</i>

473
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,760
<i>Look at the view, though.</i>

474
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,760
There. You may shoot rabbits from this window.

475
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,800
Oh, it is jolly for me, coming here.

476
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,160
<i>Well, this place will never seem the same again.</i>

477
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,760
<i>- I shall love it at last.
- Would there be anything else, sir?</i>

478
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,240
No, thank you, Milly.
No, that's all.

479
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,440
<i>We're up the staircase by ourselves.</i>

480
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:09,200
We need never be in any other part of the house,
apart from meals, that is.

481
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,080
I'll leave you to unpack.
See you down there.

482
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,120
<i>I hope you can find
enough to amuse yourself, Mr. Hall.</i>

483
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,520
So we dressed and came down
to find water lapping...

484
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,680
at the foot of the staircase...

485
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,480
and all the waiters
wearing green leather waders.

486
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,960
Yes, it was.

487
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,720
Oh, yes, that's right.

488
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,440
This house is his.
Did he tell you?

489
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,640
- No, he didn't.
- Oh, it is.

490
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,240
<i>Under my late husband's will.</i>

491
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,040
I must move to the dower house
as soon as he marries.

492
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,160
<i>A fourth year at Cambridge
would little profit a yokel like Clive.</i>

493
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,120
<i>He must take his place
here in the countryside.</i>

494
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,240
There's the game to consider.

495
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:16,120
There are the tenants.
There'll be his duties as a magistrate.

496
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,120
And unless there's a war...

497
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,440
<i>there's his political future.</i>

498
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,880
He ought to spend the year
traveling instead.

499
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,160
<i>He must see America
and, if possible, the colonies.</i>

500
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,640
He speaks of traveling.
He wants me to go with him.

501
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:34,400
<i>I trust you will,
but not Greece, Mr. Hall.</i>

502
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,400
<i>That is traveling for pleasure.
Dissuade him from Greece.</i>

503
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,120
I'd prefer America myself.

504
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,480
<i>Naturally. Anyone sensible would.</i>

505
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,200
Pippa says he writes verse.

506
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,160
<i>Have you seen any?</i>

507
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,600
<i>Mr. Hall, is there someone?</i>

508
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,120
<i>Some... Newnham girl?</i>

509
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,840
Pippa declares there is.

510
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,640
Pippa had better ask, then.

511
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,560
Did I hear my name, Mr. Hall?

512
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,400
Hyah!

513
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,880
Damn! Damn, it's locked.

514
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,560
The Goblin House.
My grandfather's grandfather built it.

515
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,600
I locked Pippa in here for a whole day once...

516
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,640
when we were small.

517
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,920
<i>Ashby's Ordinaries are up an eighth.
Three and seven-eighths, four and three-eighths.</i>

518
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,800
<i>What's Barclay Perkins doing?</i>

519
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,080
<i>Hmm. Debit one. 87.90.</i>

520
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,920
Gas staged a recovery.

521
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,920
What about Alliance and Dublin?

522
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,360
Alliance and Dublin?

523
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,360
- Consumers' orders?
- That'll do.

524
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,560
Up two - 78.80.

525
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,560
<i>Perhaps, dear Mrs. Hall,
when Clive has finally completed...</i>

526
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,760
<i>and, pray heaven,
passed his bar examinations...</i>

527
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,600
<i>would Ada not like to come down
and stay with us here at Pendersleigh?</i>

528
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,160
I do declare that our sons find amusement...

529
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,160
in the friendship of our two families.

530
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,520
<i>- But Ada is such an attractive
and good-natured girl.</i>

531
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:53,040
Although at present Clive appears to regard
his Fridays to Mondays entirely sacrosanct...

532
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,720
I'm sure that he, too,
could be enticed down.

533
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,120
I'm writing to Mrs. Hall.

534
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,680
- I thought Ada might like to stay.
- Ada?

535
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,720
Isn't that the girl whose grandfather
is going to leave her a lot of money?

536
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,880
She'll make an excellent bride for my godson.

537
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,240
Really. Perhaps Clive doesn't want to marry yet.

538
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,960
Oh, would you be so good as to post this, uh -
What's your name?

539
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,000
Scudder, ma'am.

540
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,800
<i>We are already snug
in our little house, Mrs. Durham...</i>

541
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:36,240
<i>now that Maurice is living at home
after so long away.</i>

542
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:40,920
<i>Each day, he eats a vast breakfast
and then catches the 8:36.</i>

543
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,160
<i>He returns at 4:59
and lays down the law.</i>

544
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,120
<i>He has developed,
under your son's influence...</i>

545
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,600
<i>into far more of a personage
than we had expected.</i>

546
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,320
<i>One hardly begrudges him the time
he spends as Clive's guest in London.</i>

547
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,760
<i>Is Clive not fortunate...</i>

548
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,960
<i>to have a London house now
as well as beautiful Pendersleigh Park?</i>

549
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:06,120
<i>I do confess that I am looking forward
to meeting their amusing London set...</i>

550
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,000
<i>pictures of some of whom we see
in the illustrated newspapers...</i>

551
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:12,400
<i>here at dull Alfriston Gardens.</i>

552
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,480
<i>But I concentrated
on the tips ofhis mustache.</i>

553
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,400
<i>Do you think I might have one of your cigarettes?</i>

554
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,240
Do you not think that Maurice's mustache
will be the making of him?

555
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,760
- No, it's revolting.
- Thank you, Clive.

556
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:56,600
Your cavalrymen, see,
must have legs so straight...

557
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:00,640
that they can hold a sixpence between
their legs all the way up -

558
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,920
ankles, calves, knees, thighs -

559
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,840
Not only a sixpence, is it, love?

560
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,400
For the price of your beer, no wonder.

561
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,040
- He'll never do it.
- Give the man his due.

562
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,360
One here.

563
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,680
I was a pure country lad...

564
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,040
<i>- Here.
- Till I took the queen's shilling.</i>

565
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,760
<i>- One here.
- Now it seems I've turned out bad.</i>

566
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,120
<i>- The last sixpence there.
- Oh, he's always winning.</i>

567
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,600
<i>Poor twink.</i>

568
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,240
Well, I suppose it's pints
all around, gentlemen.

569
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:44,000
- Get him!
- Come on!

570
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,920
Come here, you!

571
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,440
<i>Come along.</i>

572
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,320
Would you give me my hat?

573
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,760
I'm told that if I plead guilty,
the publicity can be kept to a minimum.

574
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,680
So what am I to do?

575
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,680
You must understand,
if I were to give you a testimonial...

576
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,120
it would make me a sitting duck
to any prosecution.

577
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,040
Yes, I see that.

578
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:22,320
I realize it might compromise your position
to be seen to be associated with me.

579
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,120
Quite understand that.

580
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,880
- Good night, Clive.
- Good night.

581
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,920
- Maurice.
- Oh. Where on earth have you been?

582
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,320
Excuse me.

583
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,120
Thanks.

584
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,000
Where have you been?

585
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,200
You all right?

586
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,720
- Clive?
- Yes, thank you, Maurice. I'm fine.

587
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,720
Please, don't nanny me.

588
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:30,480
<i>The defendant is a man ofbreeding...</i>

589
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,760
<i>who, rather than
setting an example...</i>

590
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:39,080
<i>has regrettably attempted
the corruption ofhis social inferior.</i>

591
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,280
<i>He is a man
of considerable learning...</i>

592
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,560
<i>who has taken advantage
of the gullibility...</i>

593
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:50,560
<i>and the baser passions
ofhis intellectual inferior.</i>

594
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:56,280
<i>Lord Risley, your guilt has been unquestionably
proven before this court.</i>

595
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,960
As you are no doubt aware...

596
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:02,440
I am empowered to sentence you
to imprisonment with flogging.

597
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,040
<i>However...</i>

598
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:08,120
<i>in view of
the promising career in politics...</i>

599
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,600
<i>which has been terminated
by your disgrace...</i>

600
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,600
<i>and in view of the position
in society which you have forfeited...</i>

601
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,840
I am inclined to leniency...

602
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,080
<i>in sentencing you...</i>

603
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,680
<i>to six months'imprisonment
with hard labor.</i>

604
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,040
<i>Silence.!</i>

605
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:30,880
I am satisfied that you will pay for this
for the rest of your life.

606
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,320
<i>Take him down.</i>

607
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,160
<i>All rise.</i>

608
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:03,280
<i>A wit. A... poet.</i>

609
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,720
- Breeding.
- Breeding. And now...

610
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,560
legal legislator.

611
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:14,040
- Legal legislator.
- Clive Durham, barrister-at-art.

612
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:16,760
To Clive Durham, our honored friend.

613
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,640
<i>Barrister-at-law.</i>

614
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:22,200
- Mr. Durham.
- To the most marvelous evening.

615
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:25,520
<i>Come on, Clive. On your feet. Clive.!</i>

616
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:28,400
To the Durhams
of Pendersleigh Park.

617
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,960
Oh, I say. I'm gonna faint.

618
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,520
- Mr. Durham!
- Morrie, quickly.

619
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,320
Clive.

620
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,520
Get a pillow.
Kitty, a pillow.

621
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,480
Ada, brandy.

622
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,440
- Mother.
- What is it?

623
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,560
- Fan him.
- Oh, Morrie, what is it?

624
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,600
Oh, fan, fan, fan. Fan him.

625
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:58,000
It's all right. Silly to -

626
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,840
- Oh.
- Uh, all right. I'm all right.

627
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,840
Uh, I'm all -

628
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,480
Certainly not.
Maurice is going to carry you.

629
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:09,160
Oh. Oh, dear.

630
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,680
<i>Um, Mr. Durham.</i>

631
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,520
<i>Mr. Durham, try and put
your arms around Morrie.</i>

632
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,400
<i>- Come along, old man. Up you come.
- That's it.</i>

633
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,600
<i>That's it, Morrie.</i>

634
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,560
Come on.

635
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:24,000
Put your arm around me.

636
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:27,040
- Sorry.
- The doctor. Somebody telephone.

637
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,840
Sorry, Morrie.
I'm a fool.

638
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,480
Oh, do be careful, Morrie.
It's rather hot.

639
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,400
Mother, you needn't
tell the others I kissed Durham.

640
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,320
He wouldn't like it.

641
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,240
No, of course not.

642
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:48,520
I was upset and -
and did it without thinking.

643
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,440
As you know, we're great friends.
Relations almost.

644
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,640
Mother, the doctor's here.

645
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,800
Where shall I put
the hot-water bottle?

646
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,920
<i>You mustn't do
this sort of thing.</i>

647
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:31,840
<i>You mustn't. It's filthy.</i>

648
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:35,360
<i>It doesn't worry me.
I don't say this just to please you.</i>

649
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:38,760
You can carry on all night
as far as I'm concerned.

650
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:41,840
<i>Although the doctor's coming up.</i>

651
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,560
<i>He'll see me like this.</i>

652
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,720
<i>I hope he does.</i>

653
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,360
Oh, hello, Jowitt.
Sorry to call you out so late.

654
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,720
I'm just curious, chap.

655
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:57,600
He, uh - He fainted at dinner...

656
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,640
and he can't stop crying.

657
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,840
Been working hard?

658
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,520
<i>Yes. And now he says
he's going to Greece.</i>

659
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,520
So he shall. You clear out now.

660
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,320
<i>Told your sisters none of you
were to come into this room.</i>

661
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,320
<i>- My sisters, yes. I'm looking after him.
- You equally.</i>

662
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,680
Miss Kitty has telephoned
to the institute for a nurse.

663
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,440
Why is everything done
in such a damned hurry?

664
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,960
<i>- I thought a nurse might amuse him.
- Can't we amuse him?</i>

665
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,520
I can nurse him myself.

666
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:29,040
Oh, have you wheeling the baby next.

667
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,840
Beg your pardon?

668
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,520
I suppose I ought to have the nurse.

669
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,440
Right.

670
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,960
She can...
make you more comfortable than I can.

671
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,320
- Pendersleigh today?
- Yes.

672
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,840
Mother, he can hardly stand up.
What does Jowitt say?

673
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,560
- He seems to think he's well enough to leave.
- Keep him there.

674
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:08,360
I'll get the 1:40. Someone will have to
talk sense to you people. Good-bye. What?

675
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:12,160
- Shall I send the car?
- No, I'll get a cab from the station.

676
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,840
- How much do I owe?
- Fourpence, governor.

677
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,680
Thank you.
Thank you very, very much for being so kind.

678
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,760
Well, I hope you get better soon.

679
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:34,680
<i>We've enjoyed
having him here, haven't we, Mother?</i>

680
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,840
What are you playing at, Clive?
You're far too ill to travel.

681
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,680
I can't go on being
such a bore to your family, Maurice.

682
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,840
<i>- Don't be absurd.
- Such good friends.</i>

683
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,840
<i>As he says, relations almost.</i>

684
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,640
Mother. Mother, get in.

685
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:53,720
<i>- Good-bye, Mrs. Durham.
- Thank you so much.</i>

686
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:58,200
<i>Good-bye, Mrs. Durham.
Don't let your coachman bump about.</i>

687
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,480
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

688
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,880
Good-bye.

689
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,280
<i>Good-bye. And don't forget his embrocation.</i>

690
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,400
<i>And fuller's earth, remember.</i>

691
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,640
I'll tell cook.

692
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:43,200
Terrible affair
about Viscount Risley, sir.

693
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,880
And him a parliamentary
private secretary, too.

694
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,760
I did read he was at Cambridge.

695
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,120
Like yourself, sir.

696
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,680
You will never mention
that subject again, Simcox...

697
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:07,720
while you remain
in employment here.

698
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,560
I've become a barrister...

699
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,520
so that I may enter public life.

700
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,720
But why should I enter public life? Who wants me?

701
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,640
Your mother says the country does.

702
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,640
I've talked to more people
than my mother...

703
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,560
and I tell you no one wants us...

704
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,560
or anything really,
except a comfortable home.

705
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:29,040
But to give people a comfortable home
is what public life is for.

706
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:32,840
<i>- Is or ought to be?
- Well, it's all the same.</i>

707
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:36,360
<i>- Well, "is"and "ought"are not the same.
- Quite right, Mrs. Hall.</i>

708
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,560
<i>You sound as if you have no use
whatsoever for Greece, Mr. Hall.</i>

709
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,640
It sounds out of repair.

710
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,080
A heap of old stones
without any paint on.

711
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:49,040
We shall know what it is
if you fall over this time, Mr. Durham.

712
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:52,720
Your health... and the health of all the ladies.

713
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:56,280
<i>Maurice, come.
The ladies.</i>

714
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,000
Oh. The ladies.

715
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:00,960
The ladies.

716
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,840
<i>Dear Clive...</i>

717
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,440
<i>Still no word from you,
so here is my news.</i>

718
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:46,040
<i>I am practicing a regimen
of severe self-discipline.</i>

719
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:50,640
<i>Our Wednesdays and our weekends
I spend in the darkest reaches of Bermondsey...</i>

720
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,360
<i>with the dockers lads at the mission.</i>

721
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,600
<i>It's a far cry
from our metropolitan pleasures.</i>

722
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:00,120
<i>I am supposed to be teaching them
the gentle art ofboxing.</i>

723
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,600
<i>More often than not,
I get the pummeling.</i>

724
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:07,800
<i>Preferable to the pummeling you gave me
at the Wigmore Hall. Ha, ha.</i>

725
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:13,120
<i>Most of the other evenings I spend working
through that reading list you once gave me.</i>

726
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:16,400
<i>Clive, I'm so worried
at not hearing from you.</i>

727
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:18,760
<i>I get no sleep worrying...</i>

728
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:21,640
<i>for fear that you've
fallen ill again.</i>

729
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:25,280
<i>I've looked out your connections
and would expect you back by Tuesday week.</i>

730
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:28,040
<i>Wire, if you can, on reaching Dover.</i>

731
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,440
<i>I don't have to tell you
how much I miss you.</i>

732
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:35,080
Mr. Durham.
Oh, Maurice is away tonight on business.

733
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:37,080
- Oh, no, where's he gone?
- Don't ask me.

734
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,680
We know even less about him than when
you were last here, if you think that's possible.

735
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:44,000
He keeps everything so secret.

736
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:46,800
<i>Mother, Ada,
Mr. Durham is back from Greece.</i>

737
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,920
What was Greece like?

738
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:52,880
Um, rather disappointing, I'm afraid.
It's not exactly what I'd expected it would be.

739
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,800
Why didn't you let us know?
There'll be nothing but pie.

740
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:59,000
- We would've given you a real English dinner.
- Don't worry. I can't stay.

741
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:03,440
No, Mr. Durham. You must stop the night.
We've missed you, haven't we, Ada, Kitty?

742
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,480
Maurice told us you'd be back last week.
He was so disappointed.

743
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:09,080
We can practice on you.
We've joined an ambulance class.

744
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,040
We need a victim to bandage up.

745
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:15,040
It was Dr. Barry's idea.
He says there's going to be a war soon.

746
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:18,760
You sound just like Maurice.
Your voices are wonderfully alike.

747
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:22,680
- It's 'cause I have a cold.
- No, you are alike. You do have the same voice.

748
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:25,920
And nose. By that, of course,
I mean the mouth, too.

749
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:30,320
And also his good spirits and good health.
Kitty, on the other hand, has his brains.

750
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,960
- Ow! That really hurts.
- Ow, ow.

751
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,200
<i>Yeah, well, it's my hair.</i>

752
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:42,160
That's very good, Kitty.
Thank you.

753
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,440
These are excellent. I feel so much better.

754
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:49,880
- If you knew what it was to be in England.
- Is Greece not nice?

755
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:53,000
- Horrible.
- Maurice said you'd like Greece.

756
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,760
Maurice doesn't know.

757
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:58,200
I'm happy you're back.

758
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:02,120
<i>Maurice is home.</i>

759
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,520
<i>Clive.</i>

760
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:13,680
Come out of all that, Clive.
Why did you let them?

761
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,920
I say he looks well.

762
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,640
You look well.
Come and have a drink.

763
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,840
I'll unpick you.
No, girls, not you.

764
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:37,400
Why didn't you answer my letters?

765
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,080
Don't you love me anymore?

766
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:43,040
All that must be tomorrow.

767
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:46,800
Quite so.
Have a drink.

768
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:51,320
Maurice, I don't want a row.

769
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:54,960
I do. I want a row, and I'll have it.

770
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:00,440
<i>Why didn't you write?
What secrets are you keeping from me?</i>

771
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:04,960
I was trying to work things out,
and I couldn't explain in a letter.

772
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:08,320
<i>One oughtn't to have secrets...
or they get worse.</i>

773
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,360
<i>- One ought to talk.
- No, thank you.</i>

774
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:18,040
Talk, talk, talk.
Provided one has someone to talk to.

775
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,040
As you and I have.

776
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:22,720
<i>I've thought about this solidly
for the last month and a half.</i>

777
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,960
We've got to change, you and I.

778
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:28,160
Can the leopard change his spots?

779
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:31,160
Clive, you're in a muddle.

780
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:34,240
What is it you're afraid to tell me?

781
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:37,360
Surely we've got past
sparing each other.

782
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,320
You can't trust anyone else.

783
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,040
<i>You and I are outlaws.</i>

784
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,960
All this will be
taken away from us if people knew.

785
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:47,000
Precisely.

786
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:51,800
By continuing like this,
you and I are risking everything we have.

787
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:55,160
Our careers, our-
our families, our names.

788
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,960
Balls! I don't give a damn about name.

789
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:03,240
<i>What sort of a life
would I have without you?</i>

790
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:07,280
I risk everything, and gladly,
because the one thing I...

791
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:10,080
dread losing is you.

792
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,560
You're the only happiness
there is for me.

793
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:16,160
There are other ways
to be happy, you know.

794
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:18,760
We could... explore those a little.

795
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,800
<i>- Not for me.
- Maurice...</i>

796
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:26,520
think how easy life is for people
who don't have to go through all this.

797
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,880
This... secrecy.

798
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:34,080
Never being able to talk about the person
whom you're in love with to anybody.

799
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:37,520
Imagining the servants
are thinking things.

800
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:41,000
And always being asked when you're gonna
get married, and having every bloody girl...

801
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:43,480
<i>paraded in front of you
'cause your family's so desperate.</i>

802
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,440
You want to get married, is that it?

803
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:49,720
<i>You're in love with some girl? Who is it?</i>

804
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,640
No one.

805
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:56,080
But don't you think it would be wonderful
if there - if there was someone...

806
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:59,880
who I could care about in the same way
that I do about you?

807
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,360
<i>- We love each other... and know it.
- For God's sake, Maurice...</i>

808
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:05,320
hold your tongue for a moment.

809
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,960
If I were in love with anyone now...

810
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:11,480
then it would be with some nice girl.

811
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,280
<i>- Like Ada.
- Ada?</i>

812
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:18,040
<i>- I take her at random as an example.
- You scarcely know Ada.</i>

813
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:21,120
Don't be so stupid.
Try to understand.

814
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:24,520
<i>We must change.</i>

815
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:27,880
I like you enormously.

816
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,920
More - More than any man I've ever met.

817
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:32,560
Did you say something to Ada
just before I came in?

818
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,640
<i>Didn't you hear my car come up?</i>

819
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:39,320
Why did Kitty and my mother come out and -
and not you and Ada?

820
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,480
I really can't be cross-examined
about your sister.

821
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:43,080
Why not?

822
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:46,160
- You must shut up and concentrate, Maurice.
- Ada.

823
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:48,000
- What for?
- Ada.

824
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:50,880
- Maurice, no. It mustn't end in a row.
- Ada, Ada.

825
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,800
- You can't drag in a woman. I won't have it.
- Give me the key!

826
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:56,760
Leave it!
Maurice, don't make it worse.

827
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:03,600
<i>I didn't mean to.</i>

828
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:09,640
<i>- Did I hurt you?
- I'm all right.</i>

829
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:11,640
What an ending.

830
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:14,320
What an ending!

831
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,720
<i>Maurice?</i>

832
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:19,440
What's gonna happen to me?

833
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:23,680
<i>- I'm done for.
- Maurice?</i>

834
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,120
<i>- Clive, what's the matter?
- Ada.</i>

835
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:28,120
Nothing. It's fine.

836
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,480
What's happened to your lip?

837
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:34,400
It's perfectly all right.
Just fooling about.

838
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:43,960
<i>Maurice?</i>

839
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:46,600
<i>Don't be an ass.</i>

840
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,000
Yes, he's - he's fine.

841
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,320
What's the matter with you?

842
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,520
<i>- Nothing.
- Yes, there is. I can see it.</i>

843
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,600
You can't take me in.

844
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:40,880
<i>No, really, Maurice.
It's- It's nothing.</i>

845
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,360
Why-

846
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:45,480
What did he say?

847
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:50,720
<i>- Nothing.
- Who said nothing?</i>

848
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:53,160
Clive. He said nothing.

849
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:55,160
Clive, is it?

850
01:02:57,080 --> 01:03:00,080
What is Mr. Durham to you?

851
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:03,360
Answer.

852
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,920
Do you want to know...
what he told me just now...

853
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:15,800
when I accused him of...

854
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,760
making love to you
behind all our backs?

855
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,640
<i>- What?
- When I hit him?</i>

856
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:21,880
No, Maurice.

857
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,400
He said that you -
He said you threw yourself at him.

858
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,480
<i>- That you-you tried to corrupt him.
- No.</i>

859
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:30,880
<i>He complained that you-
you made advances to him.</i>

860
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,720
And that - that's why he wouldn't stay.

861
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:36,720
<i>That's -That's why he's gone back to town.</i>

862
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:40,520
You -You -
You have the satisfaction of...

863
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,320
breaking up our friendship at least.

864
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:47,840
You've always been unkind to us.

865
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:50,000
<i>Always.</i>

866
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:55,600
It's - It's not my fault.

867
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,760
It isn't.

868
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:10,320
Stop! Remember, step back.

869
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:13,360
That's it.

870
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:28,400
<i>Go on, turn him, Larry.</i>

871
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:37,760
<i>Give him an answer.!</i>

872
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:45,520
<i>That's good of you, sir.</i>

873
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:48,560
There ain't many city gents
that'd give up their Saturdays.

874
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,640
Good night, sir.

875
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,120
Oh, good night, Mr. Hall, sir.

876
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:32,240
<i>Children, Clive Durham
is engaged to be married.</i>

877
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:35,600
- How friendly of his mother to tell me.
- Who is she?

878
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:39,440
Lady Anne Woods.
You can read it for yourself later.

879
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,800
He met her in Greece.

880
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:45,520
"Lady Anne Woods,
daughter of Sir H. Woods."

881
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,760
Oh, Mother, you got it wrong.

882
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:56,240
What Mrs. Durham wrote is
"I will now tell you the name of the lady...

883
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:59,280
Anne Woods,
daughter of Sir H. Woods."

884
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:10,640
Do you know her, Maurice?

885
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:12,880
Oh, yes.

886
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:15,720
<i>- Mr. Chapman, Miss Hall.
- Thank you.</i>

887
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:25,880
<i>Ada.</i>

888
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:32,200
Ada, I behaved badly to you
after Clive's last visit.

889
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:35,960
He - He never said those things
I let you think he said.

890
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:39,200
<i>He never blamed you.</i>

891
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:43,120
I don't care whether he did.
It doesn't signify.

892
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:45,080
I love Arthur now.

893
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:48,520
<i>Chapman's... a good fellow.</i>

894
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:53,880
For two people in love,
to marry strikes me as very jolly.

895
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,280
<i>I wish you happiness.</i>

896
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:04,880
- Hello.
- Mr. Hall, please.

897
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:07,160
Hall. Hall. For you.

898
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,560
Argentine Northern Land,
gone up again.

899
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:14,440
- Hmm. Up six.
- Hello.

900
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:16,520
Hello, Maurice.

901
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:20,080
You'll have heard my news.

902
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:25,720
- Yes, but you didn't write, so I didn't.
- Quite so.

903
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:28,600
The wedding's next month.
You'll be an usher?

904
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,560
- Best of luck.
- Anne's with me.

905
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,000
She wants to talk, too.

906
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:40,680
- I'm Anne Woods.
- My name's Hall.

907
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:43,720
Maurice Christopher Hall.

908
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:47,160
Mine's Anne Clare Wilbraham Woods.

909
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:50,640
But I can't think of anything to say.

910
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:54,960
You're the eighth friend of Clive's
I've spoken to this morning like this.

911
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:57,840
- Eighth?
- Yes, the eighth.

912
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:01,320
I'll give Clive a turn. Good-bye.

913
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:05,000
Maurice, Anne has a hundred pounds
in her pocket. Would you invest it for her?

914
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:07,480
- Certainly. What sort of thing?
- Whatever you fancy.

915
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:12,800
- I'm not supposed to fancy more than four percent.
- Barclay Perkins.

916
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:15,760
Brewing and distillers.
They're at five percent.

917
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:19,880
Or there's Argentine Northern Land.
They've gone up a sixth.

918
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:23,640
- Land investments. How about -
- I like the last one best.

919
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:26,560
Very well.
Send the check here, would you?

920
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:29,080
Can't you come down to Pendersleigh next week?

921
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:31,880
It's short notice, I know,
but later everything's gonna be chaotic.

922
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:34,840
I'm afraid I can't do that very well.
Hill's getting married, too.

923
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:36,840
Things are more or less busy here.

924
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:40,280
And after that,
Chapman's marrying Ada.

925
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:42,720
Well, uh, come in September.

926
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:45,160
Not October, because that's almost
certainly the by-election.

927
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:48,920
But come in September and see us through
that awful Park versus Village cricket match.

928
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:52,360
All right.

929
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:54,320
You'd better write nearer the time.

930
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:57,080
All right.
Good-bye, then, Maurice.

931
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:59,000
Good-bye.

932
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,280
Good-bye.

933
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:55,000
I mean, I haven't even got
a consulting room.

934
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:58,040
It's an illness
too awfully intimate forJowitt.

935
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:01,640
You're the only doctor alive
I dare tell.

936
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:04,680
A secret trouble, eh?
Yeah, right, well -

937
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:06,960
Excuse me, my dear.
Won't be a moment.

938
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,880
Come along, then.

939
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:31,800
No, no. Now take your time.

940
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,280
And remember, of course,
that this is professional.

941
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:36,680
Nothing you say will ever reach
your mother's ears.

942
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:49,600
It's about women.

943
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:53,760
Well, we'll soon fix that up.

944
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:57,680
Fix me, for God's sake.
I'm done for.

945
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:01,520
Now don't be afraid of me.
Now, when did you catch the beastly thing?

946
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:05,440
It's nothing as filthy as that.

947
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:09,040
In my own wrong way
I've kept myself clean.

948
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:12,920
Oh, well, um -
Let's have a look.

949
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:44,520
<i>- Is that you in there, Dr. Barry?
- It's all right, Ettie.</i>

950
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,520
I'm in here.

951
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,640
You're all right.

952
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:10,000
<i>- What do you mean, sir, by "all right"?
- Well, what I say.</i>

953
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:13,520
You're a clean man.
Nothing wrong with you down there.

954
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:16,080
You could marry tomorrow if you like.

955
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:18,520
<i>If you'll take
an old man's advice, you will.</i>

956
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:21,440
<i>So cover up now.
It's so-so drafty.</i>

957
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:24,840
What put all this into your head?

958
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:28,320
You've never guessed.

959
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,200
<i>I'm like Lord Risley.</i>

960
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:37,480
I'm an unspeakable.

961
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,800
The Oscar Wilde sort.

962
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:44,480
Rubbish. Rubbish.

963
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:46,680
Dr. Barry, I can't have explained.

964
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,960
Now listen to me, Maurice.

965
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:51,120
<i>Never let that evil hallucination-</i>

966
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:53,680
<i>that temptation from the devil-
occur to you again.</i>

967
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:56,240
I mean, who put that lie
into your head?

968
01:12:56,360 --> 01:13:00,360
- You, whom I see and know to be a decent fellow.
- Dr. Barry, I want -

969
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:03,880
No, sir, I'll not discuss!
The worst thing I could do for you is to discuss.

970
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:06,000
It's not rubbish to me.

971
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:07,920
Rubbish!

972
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
I've been like this
ever since I can remember...

973
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:11,960
without knowing why.

974
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,360
Am I diseased?

975
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:18,880
If I am, I want to be cured.

976
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,480
Find yourself a pretty young woman.
She'll soon cure you.

977
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,520
It's unspeakable.

978
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:27,280
Come. Dress yourself.

979
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:30,480
Oh, yes. I'm sorry.
Of course.

980
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:34,480
<i>Ettie, whiskey.</i>

981
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:17,760
Mine!

982
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,880
Sir.

983
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:33,760
<i>Bull's-eye. One less bunny wunny
for Durham to lose sleep over.</i>

984
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:38,360
<i>What? Oh, buck up, man.
Corpore sano.</i>

985
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:40,280
Look out! Mine!

986
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,120
Damn!

987
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:48,880
Will you gentlemen wish to continue shooting?
The mist's coming down.

988
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,320
I suppose he thinks it's our fault.

989
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:54,280
Very well, Scudder.
We may as well pack it in.

990
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:56,560
You'll bring the game book
up to the house.

991
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:01,320
Oh, cheer up, old man.
What has got into you?

992
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:07,080
Would you believe...
it's my birthday?

993
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:09,160
Good Lord, is it really?

994
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:14,360
I say, old man, many happy returns.
Durham never mentioned it at all.

995
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:18,400
Durham's far too busy canvassing.
Come on.

996
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:20,680
- Let's toast it in chiskey.
- That's more like it.

997
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:34,800
- Telegram arrived for you at midday, sir.
- Oh, thank you, Simcox.

998
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:38,280
There, you see?
Durham did remember your birthday.

999
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:44,840
- Shall we have that drink?
- Mm. Two large chiskeys, Simcox.

1000
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,680
Very good, sir.

1001
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:01,560
I think I may have to go
to town with you tomorrow.

1002
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:05,120
Hall, old fellow, what a pity.
You might have had more shooting.

1003
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:08,640
<i>- Nothing wrong, is there?
- No. Have business.</i>

1004
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:10,640
Happy birthday, sir.

1005
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:21,800
- Hello. Did you have a good day shooting?
- Frightful.

1006
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:26,480
It's awfully rude of Clive to have been here
so little, but he's working so hard.

1007
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:30,360
And I do think it'll be a good idea
for the poor if he does get in, don't you?

1008
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,400
He's their best friend,
if only they knew it.

1009
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:34,760
You can't worry
too much about the poor.

1010
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:37,240
One must give them a leg up,
for the sake of the country...

1011
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:39,640
but they don't suffer
as we should in their place.

1012
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:43,160
I see we're in the hands
of the right sort of stockbroker.

1013
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:46,840
Oh, here's the Reverend Borenius.
He's joining us for dinner. Do you know him?

1014
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:50,200
<i>He's come to scold Clive
about the tenants'housing.</i>

1015
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:52,360
Now, he would say
that they want love.

1016
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:56,400
- No doubt they do, but they won't get it.
- Mr. Hall.

1017
01:16:56,480 --> 01:17:00,280
I scold Clive for being cynical,
but really, I think you're being horrible.

1018
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:04,200
I get used to being horrible.
The poor get used to their slums.

1019
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:07,680
After you've banged about a bit,
you get used to your particular hole.

1020
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:12,080
Everyone yaps at first.

1021
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:14,960
I've had a telegram.
I've got to go back up to town tomorrow.

1022
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:17,120
<i>- Oh, no, not bad news I hope.
- No.</i>

1023
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:20,280
Well, in that case,
it must be an amorous intrigue.

1024
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:24,080
<i>- Maurice has to go back to London tomorrow.
- What?</i>

1025
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:27,280
<i>- Well, that's what he told me.
- But damn it, he's onlyjust arrived.</i>

1026
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:30,000
He had a telegram.
He's being awfully secretive.

1027
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:33,200
He's being impossible.
What about the cricket?

1028
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:37,800
I rather like him.

1029
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:43,560
I have a private notion he's in love.

1030
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:52,720
I think he has
a little girl up in London.

1031
01:17:57,920 --> 01:17:59,960
<i>Your hand, Pippa.</i>

1032
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:05,240
- Darling -
- It's all right, Archie. I'll manage.

1033
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:08,960
Mr. Borenius, your turn.

1034
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:11,800
Oh. Forgive me.

1035
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:16,280
The family ghost again.

1036
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:20,600
<i>There's the sweetest little hole
in the ceiling. Clive, can't we leave it?</i>

1037
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:23,600
<i>Well, we shall have to,
but let's move the pianoforte...</i>

1038
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:26,160
because I don't think
it's going to stand much more.

1039
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:30,360
<i>How about a saucer?</i>

1040
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:33,120
Clive, how about a saucer?

1041
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:35,600
Once the rain came through
the ceiling of the club.

1042
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:38,360
I rang the bell
and the servant brought a saucer.

1043
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:41,200
- I ring the bell and the servant brings me nothing.
- Hmm.

1044
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:43,840
<i>I knew this beastly present
would come in useful.</i>

1045
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:46,120
Poor Pendersleigh.

1046
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:54,840
<i>Milly, bring a basin and a duster,
and get one of the men to help shift the piano.</i>

1047
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:56,800
<i>The rain's come through again.</i>

1048
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:59,360
<i>We had to ring twice. Twice.</i>

1049
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:06,520
<i>It's got right under the sounding board.</i>

1050
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:09,160
<i>Can't make it sound
any worse than it already does.</i>

1051
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:11,920
<i>- Shall I place this lamp here?
- Ah, Scudder.</i>

1052
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,640
<i>Shift the piano, would you,
and, um, take up the carpet.</i>

1053
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:17,600
Tomorrow you'd better go up
and attack that roof again.

1054
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:22,720
Well, there we are, everybody.

1055
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:25,040
Perhaps we'd better turn in,
leave them to it.

1056
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:27,680
Before we get carried away
on the flood tide.

1057
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:31,280
Pippa, tell Simcox to bring up
my nightcap, will you?

1058
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:34,520
The cellar will be awash by now.
Why is my house falling down?

1059
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,920
Anne. Maurice, are you coming up?

1060
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:39,600
<i>A saucer would have done thejob.</i>

1061
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:43,920
<i>How very kind of you.</i>

1062
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,280
Down. Down there a bit.
Little bit more.

1063
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:03,400
More. Bit more.
Down. Down.

1064
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:07,040
Someone will have to get up
in the night, change the bowl.

1065
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,960
As soon as my body developed...

1066
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:14,400
the obscene imaginings began.

1067
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:20,080
I thought that some...

1068
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:23,120
individual curse
had descended on me.

1069
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:26,760
My schooling was pure enough.

1070
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:31,440
A terrific scandal there
before my arrival...

1071
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:35,160
meant that we were drilled all day...

1072
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:38,280
and policed all night.

1073
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:42,520
I had little chance, therefore...

1074
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:46,360
to talk about such experiences
with my school fellows.

1075
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:50,520
<i>I am the only son in my fam -</i>

1076
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:08,840
Oh, Maurice, I am glad.

1077
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,560
Well, it's the greatest thing on earth.

1078
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:14,880
Perhaps the only one.

1079
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:18,880
Anne guessed as much.

1080
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,160
Aren't women extraordinary?

1081
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:28,280
Oh, Maurice, it's what
I've always wished for you.

1082
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:30,640
I know you have.

1083
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:34,480
- You don't mind if I tell her? Only Anne, of course.
- Not a bit. Tell everyone.

1084
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:11,800
You don't mind?

1085
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:13,800
No.

1086
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:18,080
I just wanted to show that...
I hadn't forgotten the past.

1087
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:21,800
But I agree.

1088
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:24,400
Let's not mention it again.

1089
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,600
All right.

1090
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:31,960
Aren't you glad
it's all ended properly?

1091
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:33,920
How properly?

1092
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:37,280
Well, instead of that
muddle last year.

1093
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:40,680
With you.

1094
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:47,280
Quits, and I'll go.

1095
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:56,080
Come back here
as soon as you can, won't you?

1096
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:41,360
Whoo!

1097
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:10,200
Clive?

1098
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:28,280
I've been talking to Maurice.

1099
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:34,000
You were right.

1100
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:38,360
Told you he had something
up his sleeve.

1101
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:11,720
Make sure the tarpaulin covers the cover.
Pull it down.

1102
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:13,680
<i>I think he's after a tip.</i>

1103
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:15,840
Tell him to boil his head.

1104
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:19,040
<i>I offered him five shillings,
but he wouldn't take it, damn cheek.</i>

1105
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:22,760
Best of luck.
I'm so glad you're not really horrible.

1106
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:25,360
<i>- Are you?
- Good-bye, dear Maurice.</i>

1107
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:28,560
<i>Good-bye.
You gave him more, I suppose.</i>

1108
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:34,440
Five shillings not good enough?
You'll only take gold?

1109
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:46,480
I'll take it.

1110
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:52,760
<i>- Clive.
- You're coming back very soon.</i>

1111
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:54,680
- Good luck.
- Thanks, old man.

1112
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:58,560
Cheerio, old man.

1113
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:00,520
- Archie, good-bye.
- Good-bye.

1114
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:04,600
Thank you, Simcox.

1115
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:07,480
- Good-bye.
- Bye, Maurice.

1116
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:09,480
- Good-bye.
- See you soon.

1117
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:13,200
- Bye, Maurice.
- Good-bye.

1118
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:18,480
I do wish I knew the girl's name.

1119
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:35,440
You're not quite off yet, I think.

1120
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,880
No, I'm not.

1121
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:56,880
I'm nearer off now.

1122
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:01,320
Hmm.

1123
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:15,240
How do you like
my consulting room?

1124
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:22,400
- It's a nice room.
- Not too dark.

1125
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:24,400
Rather dark.

1126
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:28,800
You can see the picture
on the wall ahead of you?

1127
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:34,680
<i>Come nearer...</i>

1128
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:37,480
Mr. Hall.

1129
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:39,600
Take care of that crack
in the carpet, though.

1130
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:43,440
How broad is the crack?

1131
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:45,920
You can jump it.

1132
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:54,600
Admirable.

1133
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:59,240
Now, what do you suppose
this picture is of?

1134
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:02,440
<i>Whom is it of?</i>

1135
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:08,320
<i>It is...</i>

1136
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:12,680
Miss Edna May.

1137
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:21,400
I want to go home to my mother.

1138
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:27,800
Miss Edna May is beautiful.

1139
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:32,560
She is attractive.

1140
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:36,760
<i>- She's not attractive to me.
- What an ungallant remark.</i>

1141
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:40,160
Oh...

1142
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:42,160
Mr. Hall...

1143
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:46,440
Iook at her lovely hair.

1144
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:50,680
I like short hair best.

1145
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:53,080
<i>Why?</i>

1146
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:56,960
Because -

1147
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:06,440
<i>Because-</i>

1148
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:22,640
<i>Did it get anywhere near?</i>

1149
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:27,600
You're open to suggestion.
I made you see a picture on the bare wall.

1150
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:32,680
I'd - I'd like another appointment.

1151
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,640
Telephone me in two weeks.

1152
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:38,440
In the meantime, uh,
take exercise in moderation.

1153
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:42,840
A little tennis,
stroll around with a gun.

1154
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:50,720
Go back to the country.

1155
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:56,440
It - It seems rather foolish
to make that journey twice in one day.

1156
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:14,360
Hale fellow!

1157
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:16,680
Good Lord.
You did rush back. What a shame.

1158
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:19,920
We're just off electioneering overnight.
I'm sorry. I - I had no idea.

1159
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:27,000
But I understood distinctly from you
that all your servants had been confirmed.

1160
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:30,920
I thought so.
I did think so, Mr. Borenius.

1161
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:36,600
The trouble is, Mrs. Durham,
that even if the bishop can be prevailed upon...

1162
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:39,760
<i>I have not time to prepare him before he sails.</i>

1163
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:41,720
- Mr. Hall.
- Ah, Mr. Hall.

1164
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:43,920
<i>Simcox informed us that you'd returned.</i>

1165
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:47,520
<i>You're in time for dinner.
Did you have a successful trip?</i>

1166
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:49,360
That remains to be seen.

1167
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:51,280
Ah.

1168
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:54,800
Dinner jacket's enough tonight.
I'm afraid we're only three.

1169
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:19,600
Pardon me, sir. Um, will the gentleman
be shooting tomorrow?

1170
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:23,120
I don't think so.
Obviously not, it's the cricket match.

1171
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:27,760
I'm sure, sir, I'm very sorry if I failed
to give you and Mr. London full satisfaction, sir.

1172
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:29,680
That's all right, Scudder.

1173
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:35,480
Glad to see you
down again so soon, sir.

1174
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:39,040
That's all right, Scudder.

1175
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:45,160
<i>The way that Scudder sprang his notice on Clive.</i>

1176
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:48,120
<i>His brother has found him a job
in the Argentine.</i>

1177
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:51,840
<i>His brother has got him the fare,
so offhe goes.</i>

1178
01:31:56,440 --> 01:31:58,480
Excuse me, sir.

1179
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:02,280
The underkeeper wonders
whether you have orders.

1180
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:04,640
I saw him before dinner, Simcox.
Nothing, thanks.

1181
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:06,800
Tomorrow's the match.
I did tell him.

1182
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:10,680
He wonders whether the gentleman wished
to bathe between innings, sir.

1183
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:12,640
He's just bailed out the boat.

1184
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:15,960
<i>If that's Scudder, will you tell him I'll come
and speak to him directly?</i>

1185
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:18,160
Very good, sir.

1186
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,960
Good night, sir.

1187
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,440
Oh. Scudder.

1188
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:37,480
Good night.

1189
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:44,160
- They tell me you're emigrating.
- That's my idea, sir.

1190
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:47,120
Well, good luck to you.

1191
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:49,360
Thank you, sir.

1192
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:52,760
Seems rather strange.

1193
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:58,440
- The Argentine, I understand.
- That's right, sir.

1194
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:02,040
Have you ever visited it yourself, sir?

1195
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:05,800
No. No. England for me.

1196
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:09,720
<i>- Night, sir.
- Good night.</i>

1197
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:19,920
I'm off, then.

1198
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,840
An easy start tomorrow.

1199
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:26,080
Only Mr. Hall's pleasure to wait upon.

1200
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:28,160
Mr. Hall's a gentleman.

1201
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:13,200
<i>Was that you calling to me, sir?</i>

1202
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:15,160
I know, sir.

1203
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:17,720
It's all right. I know, sir.

1204
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:24,200
Come on. Lie down.

1205
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:18,480
<i>Sir, the church has struck.
You'll have to release m-</i>

1206
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:20,400
Maurice.

1207
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:22,880
I'm Maurice.

1208
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,480
There's the cricket pitch I have to help roll
for the match, and the young birds, too.

1209
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:30,840
The boat's done.
Mr. London dived "splack" into the water lilies.

1210
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:37,200
They told me that all young gentlemen learn
to dive. Well, I never learned to.

1211
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:41,680
It seems more natural-like
not to let your head get under the water.

1212
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:44,560
I call that drowning before your day.

1213
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:49,040
I was taught I'd be ill
if I didn't get my hair wet.

1214
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:54,120
Well, you was taught
what wasn't the case.

1215
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:03,760
Alec...

1216
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:08,440
did you ever dream you had a friend,
someone to last your whole life?

1217
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:32,280
Nice day, sir.

1218
01:38:34,040 --> 01:38:37,720
<i>- Nice day for the match.
- Hmm?</i>

1219
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:47,880
Ah, he moved that ladder
away at last, I see.

1220
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,880
<i>About time.</i>

1221
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,840
<i>Now, sir...</i>

1222
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:56,200
what will you wear, I wonder?

1223
01:38:56,280 --> 01:38:58,800
Will you put your cricketing flannels
on straightaway?

1224
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:00,840
<i>All right.</i>

1225
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:07,320
<i>Oh, sir...</i>

1226
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:09,960
in, uh, Mr. Durham's absence...

1227
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:12,440
the servants feel...

1228
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:17,320
we should be so honored
if you would captain us for the match.

1229
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:21,520
<i>I'm no cricketer, Simcox.
Who's your best bat?</i>

1230
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:24,720
We have none better
than the under gamekeeper, sir.

1231
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:26,640
Scudder, sir.

1232
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:29,680
Well, then make Scudder captain.

1233
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:32,760
Hmm.

1234
01:39:32,840 --> 01:39:34,680
Pity, sir.

1235
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:37,600
Things always go better
with a gentleman captain.

1236
01:39:37,720 --> 01:39:41,000
<i>Tell him to put me to field deep.
And I won't bat first.</i>

1237
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:44,880
Bat eighth if he likes. You might tell him,
as I shan't be down till it's time.

1238
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,800
Very good, sir.

1239
01:39:54,040 --> 01:39:57,880
Oh, dear, sir.
Mud on the carpet.

1240
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:01,640
<i>I'll send someone up.</i>

1241
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:04,640
Very good, sir.

1242
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:15,720
The captain's put himself in to bat first.
Clive Durham would never have done that.

1243
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:18,800
<i>Little points interest me.</i>

1244
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:20,840
He's our best man, apparently.

1245
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:23,680
I've an instinct the man's conceited.

1246
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:27,360
He's lasted very well.
He's playing more carefully this year.

1247
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:31,320
<i>- Run!
- Run hard, Roger.!</i>

1248
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:34,640
<i>- Throw it to the bowler's end.
- They're going two.</i>

1249
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:37,520
<i>How is he?</i>

1250
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:43,600
That's me.

1251
01:40:57,200 --> 01:40:59,200
<i>Man in.</i>

1252
01:41:14,440 --> 01:41:17,720
<i>- Go for it.
- Go on, chase it.</i>

1253
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:25,520
<i>Jolly well done.!
Marvelous.!</i>

1254
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:27,440
<i>Well done.</i>

1255
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:39,560
- After it, Graham!
- Chase hard.

1256
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:43,240
Get it in hard.
Quick, they're going three.

1257
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:45,320
- Come on.
- Chase hard.

1258
01:41:59,080 --> 01:42:01,560
I do begin to see what you mean.

1259
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:03,480
Well, with a haircut.

1260
01:42:14,160 --> 01:42:17,240
<i>Go chase it, boy.</i>

1261
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:23,480
<i>Wonderful.!</i>

1262
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:25,480
<i>Keep it up.</i>

1263
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:31,920
- Jolly well done, Hall!
- Bravo. Bravo. Well done.

1264
01:42:39,880 --> 01:42:42,360
Scudder's holding the fort for you.

1265
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:44,320
<i>- He's doing rather well.
- Out.!</i>

1266
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:49,160
Well, I suppose I'd better play for a bit,
please these people.

1267
01:42:49,320 --> 01:42:51,240
<i>Over.</i>

1268
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:55,600
<i>Simon.
Andrew, down to point.</i>

1269
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:03,120
<i>- Clive.
- Maurice.</i>

1270
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:07,240
- Aren't you exhausted?
- Well, I've had meetings till midnight.

1271
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:09,520
I've got another this afternoon.
But I'm back tonight...

1272
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:11,560
and then your visit really does begin.

1273
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:13,760
- Now, gentlemen.
- We stand rebuked.

1274
01:43:13,880 --> 01:43:15,800
To the Olympic Games, Maurice.

1275
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:32,720
<i>- Yes!
- Take him, Simon.!</i>

1276
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:36,120
<i>- No, wait. Sorry, Maurice. Sorry.
- Get it in, Andy.!</i>

1277
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:40,080
<i>How's that?</i>

1278
01:43:42,160 --> 01:43:44,080
<i>Sorry.</i>

1279
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:53,560
- Well played, Mr. Hall.
- Thank you.

1280
01:43:57,320 --> 01:43:59,880
<i>Ah. Thank you, Simcox.</i>

1281
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:10,360
<i>I know, sir.</i>

1282
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:12,840
<i>It's all right.
I know, sir.</i>

1283
01:44:16,120 --> 01:44:18,040
<i>Come on.</i>

1284
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:30,480
What sort of man
was that keeper of yours who captained us?

1285
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:33,960
Scudder? Well, he's a little bit smart...

1286
01:44:34,040 --> 01:44:37,000
but Anne would say
I'm being unfair.

1287
01:44:37,080 --> 01:44:40,040
<i>You can't expect our standard
ofhonesty in servants.</i>

1288
01:44:42,360 --> 01:44:44,480
What sort of background did he have?

1289
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:47,720
<i>Let's see. Um, wasn't his father
the butcher at Osmington?</i>

1290
01:44:47,800 --> 01:44:49,640
<i>Yes, I think so.</i>

1291
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:54,040
Is your head feeling rotten again?

1292
01:44:54,160 --> 01:44:57,160
Putrid.

1293
01:44:57,240 --> 01:45:00,600
<i>I do wish you'd think of Pendersleigh
as your second home.</i>

1294
01:45:00,720 --> 01:45:02,720
<i>Just treat it like an hotel.</i>

1295
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:04,760
<i>Come and go when you like.</i>

1296
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:08,080
Doesn't matter if I'm home or not.

1297
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:11,600
Anne feels as I do.

1298
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:52,080
Pretend to the other gentlemen
that you want a stroll.

1299
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:54,120
<i>It's easily managed.</i>

1300
01:45:54,280 --> 01:45:57,040
Then come down to the boathouse.

1301
01:45:57,160 --> 01:46:01,200
Dear sir, let me share with you once
before leaving old England.

1302
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:03,360
It's not asking too much.

1303
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:15,400
You should not resist me.
You're resisting me.

1304
01:46:15,480 --> 01:46:18,360
<i>- Damn it, I'm not.
- You're less suggestible than you were.</i>

1305
01:46:18,440 --> 01:46:21,320
- Don't give up.
- I do not propose to give up, Mr. Hall.

1306
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:24,000
Have I fallen short of your 50%?

1307
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:33,640
I needn't remind you that your sort
were once put to death in England.

1308
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:37,240
I would advise you to...

1309
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:41,080
live in some country-
France, Italy-

1310
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:45,400
where homosexuality
is no longer criminal.

1311
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:47,920
Will it ever be like that in England?

1312
01:46:48,040 --> 01:46:51,120
England has always been disinclined...

1313
01:46:51,240 --> 01:46:54,040
to accept human nature.

1314
01:46:57,680 --> 01:47:00,240
I have not told you the whole truth.

1315
01:47:00,360 --> 01:47:02,720
No, Mr. Hall?

1316
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:08,800
Since I was here, I...

1317
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:13,840
went wrong...
with the gamekeeper.

1318
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:16,720
<i>I'm terrified
he may blackmail me.</i>

1319
01:47:16,840 --> 01:47:19,360
<i>Apparently, he's quite
smart enough to do so.</i>

1320
01:47:21,080 --> 01:47:25,080
I have an idea that's what's stopping me
from going into a trance.

1321
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:28,880
He sent me a letter, you see.

1322
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:33,360
Read it.

1323
01:47:46,640 --> 01:47:50,440
"Come to the boathouse.
I have key and will let you in."

1324
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:53,040
No doubt he has a duplicate key...

1325
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:57,000
and an accomplice
waiting up at the house.

1326
01:47:57,080 --> 01:48:02,120
"I, since cricket match, do long to place
both arms around you and share with you.

1327
01:48:02,240 --> 01:48:06,240
<i>"The above now seems
sweeter than words can say.</i>

1328
01:48:06,360 --> 01:48:11,120
<i>"Mind and write if you don't come,
for I get no... sleep waiting.</i>

1329
01:48:11,200 --> 01:48:13,680
"So come without fail
to boathouse...

1330
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:15,640
<i>"Pendersleigh, tomorrow night.</i>

1331
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:19,640
<i>"Yours respectfully,
Alec Scudder.</i>

1332
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:23,080
<i>Gamekeeper to-"</i>

1333
01:48:23,160 --> 01:48:26,120
"C. Durham, Esquire."

1334
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:28,720
I'm walking on a volcano.

1335
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:33,760
He's an uneducated man,
but he's got me in his power.

1336
01:48:33,880 --> 01:48:36,240
Will he have a case
in court, do you think?

1337
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:40,240
I'm no lawyer, Mr. Hall.
You'd have to consult your solicitor.

1338
01:48:40,360 --> 01:48:44,280
<i>My children playing overhead.</i>

1339
01:48:51,960 --> 01:48:54,960
<i>How did a country lad
like that know?</i>

1340
01:48:56,560 --> 01:49:01,080
Why did he come to me that one night
when I was at my weakest?

1341
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:08,760
There we are, sir.

1342
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:20,840
Just a moment.
Uh, ticket, please. Ticket.

1343
01:49:49,680 --> 01:49:51,480
Maurice.

1344
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:53,600
What, uh -
What brings you to London, Scudder?

1345
01:49:55,320 --> 01:49:58,360
My, um, brother and I have,
um, some business here.

1346
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:01,240
You ought to know what it is.

1347
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:05,040
I'll be with you in a few minutes.
Let me just have a word with Scudder here.

1348
01:50:05,120 --> 01:50:07,320
Something's up at the mission.

1349
01:50:09,680 --> 01:50:12,960
Scudder, is it?
"Alec, you're a dear fellow," you said.

1350
01:50:13,080 --> 01:50:15,280
You did.

1351
01:50:16,280 --> 01:50:18,120
What mission?

1352
01:50:19,120 --> 01:50:21,200
What, you ashamed
to be seen with me?

1353
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:23,200
Hmm? You're not glad anyway.

1354
01:50:23,320 --> 01:50:25,240
- Don't say you are.
- Of course I'm glad.

1355
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:27,840
Then why didn't you come to the boathouse?
I waited two nights.

1356
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:30,000
- I got no sleep waiting.
- Shh!

1357
01:50:30,120 --> 01:50:33,000
- I know something.
- I'm sure you do.

1358
01:50:33,080 --> 01:50:36,080
I'm sure you could tell me
a good many things, Alec.

1359
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:38,800
I know about you and Mr. Durham.

1360
01:50:50,120 --> 01:50:52,600
This is your office, is it?

1361
01:50:52,720 --> 01:50:54,600
What do you do here?

1362
01:50:54,680 --> 01:50:57,720
You shouldn't treat me like a dog.

1363
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:01,720
You was just amusing yourself.
I've never come like that to a gentleman before.

1364
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:06,320
You said, "Call me Maurice,"
but you never even wrote to me.

1365
01:51:08,280 --> 01:51:11,120
You made a fool of me,
and I can make you sorry for it.

1366
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:40,160
He's big enough, isn't he?

1367
01:51:45,720 --> 01:51:49,480
Well, they must've owned
wonderful machinery to make a thing like that.

1368
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:51,440
I expect so.

1369
01:51:54,440 --> 01:51:56,800
Mine's got five legs.

1370
01:51:57,920 --> 01:51:59,760
So has mine.

1371
01:52:01,080 --> 01:52:04,360
It's a peculiar notion,
when you think about it.

1372
01:52:10,360 --> 01:52:13,640
It won't do, Mr. Hall.
I know what you're trying to do.

1373
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:17,040
You'd do better to settle this,
I can tell you.

1374
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:22,920
You've had your fun.
Now you've gotta pay up.

1375
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:27,920
I'll leave you to think it over.

1376
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:39,600
Surely-

1377
01:52:39,720 --> 01:52:43,000
<i>Surely you're an old boy
at Mr. Abrahams's school.</i>

1378
01:52:43,120 --> 01:52:46,520
Now, now, don't - don't tell me your name.
L- l-I want to remember.

1379
01:52:46,640 --> 01:52:50,920
I shall remember.
Um -You're -You're not Colgan.

1380
01:52:51,080 --> 01:52:55,200
You're not Smith. I know.
You're -You're Wimbleby. Yes?

1381
01:52:55,320 --> 01:52:58,000
- My name's Scudder.
- Isn't. I'm Mr. Scudder.

1382
01:52:58,120 --> 01:53:01,840
<i>And I've got a serious charge
to bring against this gentleman.</i>

1383
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:04,240
- Yes, awfully serious.
- My goodness me.

1384
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:08,200
I am really most - most frightfully sorry.
L- l-I do beg your pardon.

1385
01:53:08,320 --> 01:53:10,480
It's... seldom I make a mistake.

1386
01:53:12,920 --> 01:53:17,040
Well, remarkable place, this, isn't it?
Not just a collection of relics.

1387
01:53:17,120 --> 01:53:21,400
It's a place which could
stimulate the minds of the -

1388
01:53:21,520 --> 01:53:24,040
- Less fortunate?
- Well, quite so.

1389
01:53:24,160 --> 01:53:27,760
To ask questions which one -
which one no doubt inadequately tries to -

1390
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:30,000
<i>Ben, we're waiting.</i>

1391
01:53:30,120 --> 01:53:33,280
Oh. Uh, yes. Uh, quite so.
I, uh - I - I -

1392
01:53:33,400 --> 01:53:35,280
Excuse me.

1393
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:40,560
Extraordinary thing.

1394
01:53:40,640 --> 01:53:42,480
I shan't trouble you any further.

1395
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:44,520
Where are you going
with your serious charge?

1396
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:47,640
- I don't know what came over me.
- You blackmailed me.

1397
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:49,120
- No, sir.
- You didn't?

1398
01:53:49,240 --> 01:53:51,040
- Maurice, listen -
- Maurice am I?

1399
01:53:51,160 --> 01:53:54,200
Well, you called me Alec.
I'm as good as you.

1400
01:53:54,360 --> 01:53:56,640
I don't find you are.

1401
01:53:56,760 --> 01:54:00,320
By God, if you'd split on me to Ducie,
I'd have broken you.

1402
01:54:00,440 --> 01:54:02,960
Might have cost me hundreds,
but I've got them.

1403
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:05,440
But the police always
back my sort against yours.

1404
01:54:06,520 --> 01:54:08,320
As good as I?

1405
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:13,800
Come outside.

1406
01:54:14,840 --> 01:54:17,520
It rained even harder
than this at the boathouse.

1407
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:21,400
It was even colder.

1408
01:54:22,960 --> 01:54:24,840
Why did you not come?

1409
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:27,840
I was frightened.

1410
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:30,320
And you let yourself get afraid of me.

1411
01:54:30,440 --> 01:54:32,720
That's why we're trying
to down each other.

1412
01:54:32,840 --> 01:54:36,560
I wouldn't take a penny from you.
I don't want to hurt your little finger.

1413
01:54:36,680 --> 01:54:39,440
Come on.
Let's give over talking. Here.

1414
01:54:40,480 --> 01:54:42,800
Stop with me.
Sleep the night with me.

1415
01:54:45,480 --> 01:54:47,920
I - I can't.

1416
01:54:48,040 --> 01:54:52,080
I've got an engagement.
A formal business dinner.

1417
01:54:52,200 --> 01:54:56,680
It's my job.
Meet me another evening instead.

1418
01:54:56,800 --> 01:54:59,280
I can't come to London again.

1419
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:03,000
My father or Mr. Borenius
will be passing remarks.

1420
01:55:03,120 --> 01:55:06,920
- What does it matter if they do?
- What does your engagement matter?

1421
01:55:15,640 --> 01:55:18,240
<i>First time I "seed"you, I thought...</i>

1422
01:55:18,360 --> 01:55:20,400
<i>"I wish I had that one."</i>

1423
01:55:21,480 --> 01:55:23,600
And it is so.

1424
01:55:25,240 --> 01:55:28,200
The only good thing
to happen to me at Pendersleigh.

1425
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:31,400
"Scudder, do this.
Scudder, do that."

1426
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:33,360
The old lady, she says...

1427
01:55:33,440 --> 01:55:37,120
"Oh, would you most kindly
of your goodness post this for me -

1428
01:55:37,240 --> 01:55:39,040
What's your name?"

1429
01:55:39,160 --> 01:55:40,960
"What's your name?"

1430
01:55:41,080 --> 01:55:43,920
Every day for bloody 18 months
I went to that porch for orders...

1431
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,160
and the old bitch
doesn't even know my name.

1432
01:55:46,240 --> 01:55:49,680
I said to her,
"What's your name?" Fuck your name!

1433
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,280
Nearly did, too.

1434
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:58,320
Wish I had.

1435
01:56:00,760 --> 01:56:04,000
And you, too grand
to come to the boathouse.

1436
01:56:04,120 --> 01:56:07,440
"Haw, my man.
Five shillings not good enough for you, eh?"

1437
01:56:09,960 --> 01:56:12,520
You've no idea
how you nearly missed gettin' me.

1438
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:20,160
Boathouse was the place
I always fancied.

1439
01:56:21,720 --> 01:56:24,240
I still got the key now,
matter of fact.

1440
01:56:25,240 --> 01:56:27,720
We'll meet in your boathouse yet.

1441
01:56:27,800 --> 01:56:30,080
No, we won't.

1442
01:56:39,880 --> 01:56:42,240
You'll remember that at any rate.

1443
01:56:58,480 --> 01:57:02,040
Tomorrow's Thursday.
Friday's packing.

1444
01:57:02,160 --> 01:57:06,200
Saturday, Southampton,
so it's good-bye, old England.

1445
01:57:10,640 --> 01:57:13,480
You mean that you and I shan't meet
again after now?

1446
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:15,920
That's right.
You got it quite correct.

1447
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:22,280
- Stay with me.
- Stay? Miss my boat?

1448
01:57:22,360 --> 01:57:24,280
You daft?

1449
01:57:25,360 --> 01:57:27,760
Of all the bloody rubbish.

1450
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:31,440
Order me about again, you would.

1451
01:57:31,560 --> 01:57:35,040
It's a chance in a thousand we met.
You know it.

1452
01:57:36,040 --> 01:57:39,400
- Why don't you stay?
- Stay? With you?

1453
01:57:39,560 --> 01:57:42,240
How? And where?

1454
01:57:42,360 --> 01:57:44,240
With your ma?

1455
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:47,720
Oh, yeah.
What would she say if she saw me?

1456
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:51,040
All rough and ugly the way I am.

1457
01:57:51,160 --> 01:57:53,280
My people wouldn't
take to you one bit.

1458
01:57:54,280 --> 01:57:56,320
And I don't blame them either.

1459
01:57:56,440 --> 01:57:59,080
<i>And how would you run yourjob,
I'd like to know?</i>

1460
01:57:59,160 --> 01:58:01,000
I shall chuck it.

1461
01:58:01,080 --> 01:58:04,040
Your job in the city
what gives you money and position?

1462
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:08,680
<i>You talk like a man
who's never had to earn his living.</i>

1463
01:58:09,720 --> 01:58:14,160
You can do anything...
once you know what it is.

1464
01:58:14,280 --> 01:58:16,560
We can live without money,
without people.

1465
01:58:16,680 --> 01:58:19,440
<i>We can live without position.</i>

1466
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:22,840
<i>We're not fools.</i>

1467
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:25,520
<i>We're both strong.</i>

1468
01:58:25,600 --> 01:58:27,760
There'll be someplace we could go.

1469
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:34,000
Wouldn't work, Maurice.

1470
01:58:34,120 --> 01:58:37,680
Be the ruin of... us both.

1471
01:58:39,640 --> 01:58:41,840
Can't you see?

1472
01:59:02,520 --> 01:59:05,280
Well, I'm off.

1473
01:59:13,720 --> 01:59:17,000
Pity we ever met, really,
if you think about it.

1474
01:59:26,240 --> 01:59:29,280
You paid for this room in advance,
didn't you?

1475
01:59:29,400 --> 01:59:31,520
I mean, they won't stop me
downstairs or anything?

1476
01:59:33,600 --> 01:59:35,480
You'll be all right.

1477
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:09,920
Edgar, I shan't be long.
Just wait for me.

1478
02:00:10,040 --> 02:00:11,920
- Yes, sir.
- All right?

1479
02:00:23,200 --> 02:00:27,200
- Good afternoon.
- Oh, yes, um, I've come to see a passenger off.

1480
02:00:27,320 --> 02:00:30,520
- Alec Scudder.
- Ah, the Scudders.

1481
02:00:30,640 --> 02:00:32,960
Yes, I believe they're up there, sir.

1482
02:00:36,240 --> 02:00:38,640
- Right, thank you.
- Thank you very much, sir.

1483
02:00:38,760 --> 02:00:41,040
Plenty of time yet.

1484
02:00:41,120 --> 02:00:44,040
Oh, he won't be late.
If Alec says a thing, he means it.

1485
02:00:44,120 --> 02:00:46,000
He can be late if he likes.

1486
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:48,760
I can manage without him,
but he needn't expect me to help him anymore.

1487
02:00:48,920 --> 02:00:51,040
Mr. Scudder?

1488
02:00:55,400 --> 02:00:59,760
You must be Alec Scudder's brother.
I've come to see him off.

1489
02:00:59,880 --> 02:01:04,600
Alec ain't aboard yet, but his kit is.
Interested to see his kit?

1490
02:01:04,720 --> 02:01:07,160
No, no, no, don't worry.

1491
02:01:07,280 --> 02:01:10,200
I'll just wait with you, if I may.

1492
02:01:10,320 --> 02:01:12,880
My name's Maurice Hall.

1493
02:01:41,240 --> 02:01:43,960
<i>Good afternoon, Mr. Hall.</i>

1494
02:01:44,080 --> 02:01:46,520
Now, this is kind of you, Mr. Hall.

1495
02:01:46,640 --> 02:01:50,400
I could hardly believe my eyes
when I saw you among his friends here.

1496
02:01:50,520 --> 02:01:52,800
<i>Family. My parents.</i>

1497
02:01:52,920 --> 02:01:57,000
<i>And I'm his brother, Frederick Scudder,
purveyor of viand, at your service.</i>

1498
02:01:57,120 --> 02:02:01,840
Ah. I am Mr. Borenius.
Alec is one of my parishioners.

1499
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:06,040
I've come to give him a letter of introduction
to an Anglican priest in Buenos Aires...

1500
02:02:06,160 --> 02:02:09,000
in the hopes that
he will be confirmed after landing.

1501
02:02:09,080 --> 02:02:13,200
<i>Very kind of you, sir, I'm sure.</i>

1502
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:21,960
<i>- How did you know so precisely
when the boat sailed?
- All aboard who's coming aboard.</i>

1503
02:02:22,040 --> 02:02:24,960
<i>- It was advertised.
- All aboard now.</i>

1504
02:02:25,080 --> 02:02:29,560
May I speak frankly to you?
I'm far from easy about Scudder.

1505
02:02:29,720 --> 02:02:32,080
The fact is...

1506
02:02:32,240 --> 02:02:34,920
he has been guilty of sensuality...

1507
02:02:36,280 --> 02:02:38,120
with women.

1508
02:02:38,200 --> 02:02:40,200
It's not just the deed
of fornication.

1509
02:02:40,320 --> 02:02:44,400
When the nations went a-whoring,
they invariably ended up by denying God.

1510
02:02:44,480 --> 02:02:47,120
Until all sexual irregularities,
and not some of them, are penal...

1511
02:02:47,240 --> 02:02:49,960
the church will never again
reconquer England.

1512
02:02:50,040 --> 02:02:52,080
I have reason to believe...

1513
02:02:52,200 --> 02:02:56,200
Scudder spent
Tuesday night... in London...

1514
02:02:57,880 --> 02:02:59,760
fornicating.

1515
02:03:01,680 --> 02:03:06,200
I'm telling you all this
because of your charitable interest in him.

1516
02:03:08,480 --> 02:03:11,400
<i>But surely he wouldn't have missed his train.</i>

1517
02:03:11,480 --> 02:03:15,120
<i>- Well, they wouldn't leave without him.
- He's late.</i>

1518
02:03:15,240 --> 02:03:17,640
He's bloody well missed
his bleeding train!

1519
02:03:17,760 --> 02:03:19,840
Gentlemen! Gentlemen.

1520
02:03:21,560 --> 02:03:23,600
Gentlemen, I do assure you...

1521
02:03:23,720 --> 02:03:27,280
<i>Mr. Scudder was booked for a passage.</i>

1522
02:03:27,400 --> 02:03:30,280
But his kit's aboard.
His kit's aboard.

1523
02:04:30,680 --> 02:04:32,920
Clive.

1524
02:04:33,080 --> 02:04:35,320
Don't tell Anne I'm here.
I've only a few minutes.

1525
02:04:38,520 --> 02:04:40,880
I mean -
Look here, man, that's fantastic.

1526
02:04:40,960 --> 02:04:43,600
<i>She'll be furious
if you don't stay the night.</i>

1527
02:04:43,720 --> 02:04:45,720
Maurice, I hope nothing's wrong.

1528
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:48,400
Pretty well everything.

1529
02:04:50,040 --> 02:04:51,920
You'd think so.

1530
02:05:11,680 --> 02:05:14,960
Very well. I'm at your service.

1531
02:05:15,120 --> 02:05:19,160
My advice, though, is to sleep here tonight
and ask Anne in the morning.

1532
02:05:19,280 --> 02:05:22,960
Where a woman is in question,
it's always better to ask another woman...

1533
02:05:23,040 --> 02:05:25,600
and particularly if she has
Anne's almost uncanny insight.

1534
02:05:25,720 --> 02:05:27,880
I'm not here to see Anne.

1535
02:05:27,960 --> 02:05:30,440
Or you, Clive.
It's miles worse for you.

1536
02:05:31,880 --> 02:05:34,000
I'm in love with Alec Scudder.

1537
02:05:38,960 --> 02:05:41,240
What a grotesque announcement.

1538
02:05:46,040 --> 02:05:47,920
Most grotesque.

1539
02:05:48,040 --> 02:05:49,960
- But I felt I ought to tell you.
- Maurice -

1540
02:05:50,080 --> 02:05:53,200
Maurice, we did everything we could
when you and I thrashed out the subject.

1541
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:56,560
- When you brought yourself to kiss my hand.
- Don't allude to that.

1542
02:05:59,960 --> 02:06:01,800
Come in here.

1543
02:06:05,240 --> 02:06:08,000
I'm more sorry for you
than I can possibly say.

1544
02:06:08,120 --> 02:06:12,320
And I do, do beg you to resist
the return of this obsession.

1545
02:06:12,400 --> 02:06:14,240
I don't need advice.

1546
02:06:14,320 --> 02:06:18,120
I'm flesh and blood, Clive,
if you'll condescend to such low things.

1547
02:06:20,200 --> 02:06:22,120
I've shared with Alec.

1548
02:06:23,280 --> 02:06:25,160
Shared - Shared what?

1549
02:06:26,200 --> 02:06:28,080
Everything.

1550
02:06:29,200 --> 02:06:32,240
Alec slept with me in the Russet Room
when you and Anne were away.

1551
02:06:32,320 --> 02:06:34,160
Oh, good God.

1552
02:06:36,440 --> 02:06:38,800
Also in town.

1553
02:06:38,920 --> 02:06:43,760
The sole excuse for any relationship between
two men is that it remain purely platonic.

1554
02:06:43,920 --> 02:06:47,560
- Surely we agreed that.
- I don't know.

1555
02:06:47,640 --> 02:06:49,920
I've come to tell you what I did.

1556
02:06:50,920 --> 02:06:56,520
Well, Alec - Scudder- is in point of fact
no longer in my service.

1557
02:06:56,600 --> 02:07:00,560
In fact, he's no longer in England.
He sailed for Buenos Aires this very day.

1558
02:07:00,640 --> 02:07:04,520
He didn't.
He sacrificed his career for my sake...

1559
02:07:04,600 --> 02:07:07,200
without a guarantee.

1560
02:07:07,280 --> 02:07:10,160
I don't know whether
that's platonic of him or not...

1561
02:07:10,280 --> 02:07:12,880
but it's what he did.

1562
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,280
Scudder missed his boat?

1563
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:18,960
Maurice, you're going mad.

1564
02:07:19,120 --> 02:07:22,680
- May I ask if you intend to pursue -
- No. No, you may not ask.

1565
02:07:22,800 --> 02:07:25,280
I'll tell you everything up to this minute.
Not a word beyond.

1566
02:07:57,800 --> 02:07:59,600
Alec?

1567
02:08:40,360 --> 02:08:42,160
Alec.

1568
02:08:44,600 --> 02:08:46,920
So you got the wire, then?

1569
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,400
What wire?

1570
02:08:49,520 --> 02:08:51,800
The wire I sent to your house...

1571
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:55,920
telling you -

1572
02:08:56,040 --> 02:08:57,880
Oh, sorry.

1573
02:08:58,000 --> 02:08:59,880
I'm a bit tired,
what with one thing and another.

1574
02:09:02,880 --> 02:09:04,720
No. Telling you to come here...

1575
02:09:04,800 --> 02:09:07,040
to the boathouse
at Pendersleigh without fail.

1576
02:09:20,520 --> 02:09:23,200
Now we shan't never be parted.

1577
02:09:23,320 --> 02:09:25,200
It's finished.

1578
02:09:51,480 --> 02:09:53,400
Will that be all, sir?

1579
02:09:53,520 --> 02:09:55,320
Yes. Thank you, Simcox.

1580
02:09:55,440 --> 02:09:57,320
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

1581
02:11:09,200 --> 02:11:11,120
<i>Come on.!</i>

1582
02:11:25,160 --> 02:11:27,280
Who were you talking to?

1583
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:29,600
No one. No one.

1584
02:11:29,720 --> 02:11:31,920
I was just trying out a speech.
