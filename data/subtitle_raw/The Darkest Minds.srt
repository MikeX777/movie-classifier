Grace!

4
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,830

Mr. President!

29
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:19,723
Do you have any updates

30
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:20,974
on the I.A.A.N. pandemic?

31
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:22,100
Uh, yes, I do.

32
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:26,563
Uh, first, I want to say to you
that I am speaking today...

33
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,691
not as your president,
but as a parent.

34
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:32,318
As you know, my son...

35
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,991
My son is among the survivors,

But most importantly,
it has given my family hope.

39
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:49,461
And I urge you, I urge you
to give your children

40
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,462
that same hope.

41
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,255
<i>The CDC is here for you.</i>

<i>This is not about politics.</i>

45

This is about your children.

46
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:01,639
This is about our...
Our children.

47
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,058
We will find a cure

48
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:06,644
and we will save our precious
sons and daughters. Thank you.

49
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,271
Mr. President!

50
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,403
Surprise!

51
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,697
Happy birthday, honey.

52
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,204
Gudetama!

53
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,414
That's the one
you wanted, right?

54
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,582
Totally.

55
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,126
When you are 16,
you can put a car key on it.

56
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,671
It probably won't be cool

57
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,506
when I'm 16.

58
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,303
It's okay, Mommy.

59
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,223
You don't have to worry
about me.

60
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,141
I'll be fine.

61
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,147
Okay, bedtime.

62
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:53,316
I love you.

63
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,684
Don't worry
anymore, Mommy and Daddy.

64
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:30,478
Nothing can take me away
from you.

65
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,336
- Mom, my head hurts.
- Oh, my God!

66
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,090
How did you get in here?

67
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,969
Sweetheart, are you...
Are you lost?

68
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,388
Do your parents know
that you're here?

69
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,100
Why are you saying that?

70
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,477
Can you tell me your name?

71
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:12,854
Mommy, what's wrong?

72
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:14,898
I am not your mommy.

73
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,275
Yes, you are.

74
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:18,985
You and Dad gave me this

75
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,904
for my birthday yesterday,
remember?

76
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,614
Here, come-- Come with me.

77
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,909
Come on, okay? Come on.

78
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,869
What did I do wrong?

79
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:28,870
Where are we going?

80
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,246
I just need you
to wait right here,

81
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,664
just wait right there, okay?

82
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:32,624
Just wait.

83
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,879
I'm sorry! Please!

84
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:41,257
This is my house!
You're my parents.

85
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,112
Contact made
with survivor.

86
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,197
Approach with extreme caution.

87
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,283
No, no!

88
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,748
<i>It was the beginning.</i>

89
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,751
<i>The government wasn't scared</i>

90

<i>of what happened
to the dead kids</i>

91
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,172
<i>or the empty spaces
that they would leave behind.</i>

92
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,386
<i>They were afraid of us.</i>

93
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,514
<i>The ones who lived.</i>

94
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,893
<i>Soon, there wouldn't be
any kids anywhere.</i>

95
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:41,276
<i>You either died
or you went to the camps.</i>

96
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,070
Let's move it, now!

97
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,907
- All right, they're coming in.
- Let's go!

98
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,210
Move! Let's go!
Don't try to run.

99
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:00,712
Don't talk.

100
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,007
Don't do anything other than
what is asked of you.

101
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,925
Failure to follow
these instructions

102
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,844
will be met with punishment.

103
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:08,845
Piss off!

104
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:12,849
Stay down!

105
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:26,196
LaVine, LaVine!
What are you doing?

106
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:29,866
Orange! He did that! Orange!

107
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,868
Take him out.
You know what to do.

108
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,787
Move, all of you. Inside!

<i>All new

110
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,468
Is this a hospital?

111
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:50,345
Name?

112
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,515
Your name, young lady.

113
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,308
Ruby Daly.

114
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,479
I don't feel sick.

115
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,773
Actually, it's not a sickness.

116
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:05,193
You survived the sickness,
but you're not the same.

117
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,445
And until you are,
there's no going home.

118
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:11,324
Now, when they picked you up,
were you assigned a color?

119
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,284
Color?

120
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,036
Yes.

121
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,456
All kids are given
a color assignment

122
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,417
that corresponds
to their disorder.

123
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,669
On the bottom here are Greens.

124
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,629

<i>Blues have

<i>Golds can

127
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:34,764
Up here, past this line,
are the most dangerous.

128
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:38,560
Reds and Oranges.
But they are very rare.

129
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,895
I'm sure you have nothing
to worry about.

130
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,356
Are you very good
at math and puzzles?

131
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,567
Because that means

132
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,485
you're most likely
in Green territory.

133
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,697
And that's not so terrible.

134
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,166
Orange!
Orange! Orange!

135
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,752
Take him out. You know what to do.

136
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,131
It'll be okay.
We can fix this.

137
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:11,176
Get back here!

138
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,387
Stay still. Stay still.

139
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,312
I'm a Green.

140
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:24,731
I'm one of the smart ones.

141
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,107
Yes.

142
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:39,954
You're a Green.

143
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,462
<i>In the camps
we were segregated by color.</i>

144
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:49,881
<i>Greens.</i>

145
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:50,965
<i>Blues.</i>

146
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:52,676
<i>Golds.</i>

147
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,344
<i>But no Reds.</i>

148
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,221
<i>And no Oranges.</i>

149
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,390
<i>Except for me.</i>

150
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,519
<i>Having been told
that our gifts</i>

151
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,521
<i>were finally being brought
to light...</i>

152
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,858
<i>I had to bury mine

<i>Stations will be assigned

Doing it wrong.

158
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,954
Like this.

159
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,832
Look at me.

160
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,627
Look at me.

161
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:13,548
Look at me!

162
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,679
We're not supposed
to look at you.

163
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:22,932
Hmm. Yeah.

164
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:27,395
The aglets
go over the holes, not under.

165
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,029
I've had my eye on you
for a while.

166
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,199
You're too dumb to be a Green.

167
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:41,868
But after today,
we're gonna know the truth.

168
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,370
The aglets go under.

169
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:46,790
What did you say?

170
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:48,833
If you want a tighter fit,

171
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,711
the aglets should go under,
not over.

172
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:54,464
Aren't you super smart?

173
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:57,258
Yeah, like every Green
in this room.

174
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,386
I guess inhaling
all that shoe polish

175
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,388
killed whatever brain cells
you had left.

176
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:05,975
We'll see about that.

177
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:07,811
Get your hands off of me!

178
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,480
Run the test!

179
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:12,941
<i>Initiate subatomic

180
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,109
<i>Copy that.</i>

181

<i>Frequency test one.</i>

182
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,049
Ruby?

183
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,719
Ruby, do you hear me?

184
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,264
Ruby, can you hear me?

185
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:47,475
Oh, no. Shh, shh! It's okay.
It's okay. Hey. You're okay.

186
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,352
You're gonna be fine, Ruby.

187
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,605
Are you still in pain?

188
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,444
Do you know where you are?

189
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:01,990
Yes.

190
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:03,158
Okay.

191
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,367
Hi.

192
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,536
I'm Dr. Begbie.

193
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,830
But if it makes you feel
more comfortable,

194
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:09,998
you can call me Cate.

195
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,541
Forget the doctor business.

196
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,504
You know, before this,
I was a social worker.

197
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,468
And you remind me of a girl
I used to know.

198
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,013
What happened to her?

199
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,142
I couldn't help her then.

200
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:36,358
But I want you to know
that I'm here for you now.

201
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,238
Do you remember falling

202
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,907
when they turned on
the white noise?

203
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,577
Time's up!

204
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:53,666
This time it was different.

205
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:04,219
I need to keep her overnight.
I have more tests to run.

206
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,096
You gotta take that up
with Captain McManus.

207
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:25,782
Results of the frequency test.

208
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:28,034
Who spiked the highest?

209
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:33,456
My God, alert the captain.

210
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:35,625
<i>We got a security breach.</i>

211
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,877
<i>Lock down the infirmary
immediately.</i>

212
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,552
Okay. Here.

213
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,429
- Put these on. Hurry, okay?
- Okay.

214
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,638
Let's go.

215
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:50,432
Play along.

216
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:55,687
<i>Security breach. Lock down...</i>

217
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,313
Okay, come on.
Let's go.

218
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,192
Come on, come on, come on!

219
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,657
Cover your face
as much as you can.

220
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:10,493
If they catch you,
they'll kill you.

221
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,846
Hey, I've got Dr. Rogers
with me.

222
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:32,849
Dr. Rogers, ID, please.

223
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:34,225
Yeah,
I have it right here.

224
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,644
She, uh, is zonked out
on pain meds, poor thing.

225
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:39,522
Dr. Rogers.

226
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,149
I'm gonna have to ask you
to remove your mask.

227
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:42,650
Captain, I don't think
that's a good idea.

228
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:43,693
She is highly contagious.

229
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:44,903
Roll down
the back window, please.

230
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,071
Captain,
I don't think that's a--

231
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,572
We have a security breach.

232
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,032
Roll down the back window.

233
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:52,744
I'm not asking again.

234
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:58,750
Dr. Rogers...

235
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:01,378
I'm ordering you
to remove your mask.

236
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:03,004
- Understood?
- Cap...

237
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:04,422
Now!

238
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:09,678
You don't feel well.

239
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:12,597
Uh... I don't feel well.

240
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,766
You will let us move on.

241
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:21,106
Move along.

242
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,525
Oh, my God!

243
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:23,418
Where are we?

244
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,671
We just left Harvey,
West Virginia.

245
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:30,383
We met up with a friend
who helped me switch cars.

246
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:33,303
Where is everybody?

247
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:38,183
Uh, most people fled
to the big cities for work.

248
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,393
No kids. No economy.

249
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:44,314
No kids?

250
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,031
How long will it take
to get home?

251
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:54,240
Home?

252
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:55,575
- You're taking me home, right?
- No.

253
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:56,951
But I just wanna go home.

254
00:17:57,243 --> 00:18:01,039
Ruby, I can't take you home.
It's not safe there.

255
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:03,083
Get down. Get down.

256
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,510
I'm gonna protect you.

257
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:17,222
How?

258
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,182
Have you heard
of the Children's League?

259
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:20,141
No.

260
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:22,686
Most people don't realize
the camps are total bullshit,

261
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,604
because the White House
keeps flaunting

262
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:27,315
its reformed children on TV,
including the president's son.

263
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:29,609
So we started the League

264
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:31,111
to get you guys
out of the camps.

265
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:33,196
Those on the upper end
of the scale,

266
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:36,074
the Reds and the Oranges,
are considered too dangerous.

267
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:39,160
Ruby, you are very, very rare.

268
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:42,372
Among the most powerful
and the least trusted.

269
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:45,750
Those like you are...
killed on sight.

270
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:47,460
What are you going to do?

271
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:49,963
If we ever get separated

272
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:51,673
and you find yourself
in danger,

273
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:53,800
I want you
to squeeze this pendant

274
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:54,843
for three seconds.

275
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:58,680
It's a tracking device,
but only if you activate it.

276
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:01,725
And it only goes to me.
Okay?

277
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,394
Look, Ruby,
you and I both know

278
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:06,271
how dangerous it is out here.

279
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:09,566
At some point,
it might be really nice

280
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,317
to have someone
looking out for you.

281
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:20,160
<i>And now
the president's son,</i>

282
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:22,287
<i>Clancy Gray,
with his message of hope.</i>

283
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,039
<i>If I can be cured,
you can be cured.</i>

284
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:31,296
We did it.

285
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:32,630
I never doubted you
for a second.

286
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,007
Wait. Where are your two?

287
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:35,759
I couldn't get them out.

288
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:38,511
What?
So sorry.

289
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,306
Yeah, but I got a lead
on a Red.

290
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:43,558
Oh, Ruby, this is Rob.

291
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,768
It's nice to meet you.

292
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,189
We don't have a ton of time.

293
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,815
And we need you
to change, okay?

294
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,401
New clothes, soap,
some other things.

295
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:55,320
The bathroom in the station
still has running water.

296
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:56,488
But hey.

297
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,281
Definitely don't drink it,
okay?

298
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:03,495
Whoa, whoa!

299
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:07,332
Get back here!

300
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,336
You're not going anywhere.

301
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,421
You okay?

302
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:17,550
Yeah, uh, I just tripped.

303
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:12,772
Hey!

304
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:19,237
Hey!

305
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:27,787
Please, let me in!

306
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:29,289
I have nowhere to go.
No one to trust.

307
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:32,500
Please!

308
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:34,377
Ruby!

309
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:38,089
Come on!

310
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:41,176
Please. I think
they're trying to kill me.

311
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,642
<i>It was Lady Jane.</i>

312
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:51,978
I saw her
with my own eyes, dude!

313
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,146
Yeah, you're blind.

314
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:54,522
Let's just focus
on finding East River.

315
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:04,407
Ruby!

316
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,329
- Ruby!
- Ruby!

317
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:11,206
- Who are these guys?
- Go, go, go.

318
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:30,642
What happened
at the gas station, Zu?

319
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:32,727
- Did they see you?
- Yeah, and who's Ruby?

320
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:35,105
I'm Ruby.

321
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:44,155
Ruby Daly.

322
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:50,286
What do we
always tell you, Zu?

323
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:51,788
No strays.

324
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:52,831
Wait, I'll handle this.

325
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:54,124
Don't worry, I'm leaving.

326
00:22:56,626 --> 00:22:58,837
Wait, did you just come
from the camp?

327
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,338
Yeah, they broke me out.

328
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:02,215
But I'm Green,
I'm not a threat.

329
00:23:02,257 --> 00:23:04,676
- "They" being the League?
- Open the freaking door, Liam!

330
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:06,553
We already got the cops
and the Tracers on our ass,

331
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:08,388
we don't need to add
the League to the list.

332
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,140
What if they put in a call
that there's four kids

333
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:11,641
cruising around
in a beat-up, blue minivan?

334
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:13,518
Ooh, that's no way
to talk about Betty, man.

335
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,563
Excuse me for hurting
the feelings of a Nissan van.

336
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:18,773
Please, just let me out.
I'm really sorry.

337
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:19,941
You're not going
with the League.

338
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:21,317
What? Liam!

339
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:24,404
I'm Liam. That's Zu.
This is Chubs.

340
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:26,948
- Chubs?
- Charles to you.

341
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,533
Yeah, he used to be
a bit beefier.

342
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:29,993
Zu can back me up on that one.

343
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,037
Right, Zu? What's wrong?

344
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:45,967
That's Lady Jane!
I told you I saw Lady Jane!

345
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:46,885
Shit.

346
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:56,144
Come on, we got to go.
Go, go, go. Punch it!

347
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:03,443
She's crazy!

348
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:05,653
Whoa!

349
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:18,708
It's the League, man!

350
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:20,043
Go, go, go!

351
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:31,721
Please. You have to let me out
before someone gets hurt.

352
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,640
Liam. Let her out, man.

353
00:24:33,682 --> 00:24:34,641
Shut up, I got this.

354
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:35,975
- Can you drive?
- No.

355
00:24:36,017 --> 00:24:37,352
Yeah, well,
you're gonna have to.

356
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:39,270
Chubs can't see more than
ten feet in front of his face.

357
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:40,230
I heard that.

358
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:41,398
Dude, come on,
it's just like a bike.

359
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:43,566
- Tell me you've ridden a bike.
- Of course I've ridden a bike!

360
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:44,693
- Come on.
- Don't touch me.

361
00:24:45,068 --> 00:24:46,236
- Come on.
- Okay.

362
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:47,696
Come on. You got this.

363
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:56,329
Okay, good. Come on.

364
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:57,539
We're so dying.

365
00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:59,290
- Keep driving.
- Okay.

366
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:03,461
- Whoa! You got me?
- Yeah, I got you.

367
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:11,011
What's he doing?

368
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:24,941
- Drive faster.
- Okay.

369
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:34,701
Whatever happens, don't stop.

370
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:47,464
Rob!

371
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:04,397
Watch out!

372
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,159
Nice driving.

373
00:26:18,078 --> 00:26:19,913
This is so not like
riding a bike.

374
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:41,101
Do you guys even know
where you are?

375
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:44,104
Don't look so scared.
Chubs is a map expert.

376
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:46,940
I'm Green, so all maps
make sense to me.

377
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:48,108
So does theoretical physics,

378
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:49,567
existentialism
according to Thoreau,

379
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:50,944
speed chess,
artificial intelligence.

380
00:26:50,985 --> 00:26:52,153
Yeah. In short,
the kid is smart.

381
00:26:52,195 --> 00:26:53,488
What, you think I rock
these geeky-ass

382
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,906
Coke-bottle glasses for show?

383
00:26:55,156 --> 00:26:56,241
Plus, I'm smart enough to know

384
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:57,701
no one gives a crap
about Greens.

385
00:26:58,993 --> 00:27:00,161
So enlighten me,

386
00:27:00,203 --> 00:27:01,579
why the hell
would the League go through

387
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:02,872
all this trouble for you?

388
00:27:02,914 --> 00:27:04,541
What makes you so special?

389
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:05,917
Chubs, leave her alone.

390
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:07,794
If we're gonna be stuck
with her, we need to know.

391
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:09,254
You're not gonna be
stuck with me.

392
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:11,631
I'm going home.

393
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:14,551
Wait, where is home?

394
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:16,261
Salem, Virginia.

395
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:22,559
Hey!

396
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,935
What are you gonna do?

397
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:25,937
Walk back to the highway
and hitchhike?

398
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:27,272
You'll be nabbed by a Tracer

399
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:28,815
and back in a camp
in time for bed.

400
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:30,108
A Tracer?

401
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:31,693
Bounty hunters.

402
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:33,695
Like that crazy Lady Jane

403
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:35,280
who nearly smoked our ass
back there?

404
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:37,365
Man, for a Green, she sure
takes a while to catch up.

405
00:27:37,866 --> 00:27:39,951
You should come with us.
We're going to East River.

406
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:41,453
Don't tell her.

407
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:42,746
Supposedly,
it's this huge compound

408
00:27:42,787 --> 00:27:44,414
where kids can live together
on the outside.

409
00:27:44,748 --> 00:27:47,417
There's food, a place to stay,
and it's safe.

410
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:49,127
The Slip Kid's in charge.

411
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:50,211
Who?

412
00:27:50,253 --> 00:27:51,504
No one knows
who he really is.

413
00:27:51,546 --> 00:27:53,840
He got the name because
he slipped custody four times.

414
00:27:54,758 --> 00:27:57,510
And supposedly he's an Orange.

415
00:27:57,761 --> 00:27:58,970
Nice, Liam.

416
00:27:59,262 --> 00:28:00,638
You wanna tell her
your shoe size

417
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,140
and your favorite animal
while you're at it?

418
00:28:05,393 --> 00:28:06,936
Dinner?

419
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:09,731
Sweet! It's literally sweet.

420
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:22,077
We're your best chance
of getting home.

421
00:28:56,945 --> 00:28:58,446
If the League
was protecting us

422
00:28:58,488 --> 00:29:01,491
from the Tracer shooting at us
then what makes them so bad?

423
00:29:01,866 --> 00:29:03,868
The enemy of my enemy
is my friend?

424
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:07,330
Yeah, like that ever works.

425
00:29:07,956 --> 00:29:10,041
The woman that I met
risked a lot

426
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:11,126
to get me out.

427
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:12,961
She seemed okay.

428
00:29:13,003 --> 00:29:14,629
Some shady lady kidnaps you,

429
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:16,214
and you think
that's all right?

430
00:29:16,256 --> 00:29:18,091
You were hanging with
the wrong people.

431
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:19,300
Like, did she lure you
with candy

432
00:29:19,342 --> 00:29:20,719
from a panel van or something?

433
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,012
You weren't there.

434
00:29:22,637 --> 00:29:24,347
She said that the League
wanted to help me.

435
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,850
And I ran away.

436
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:29,185
But what if I was wrong?
What if they can?

437
00:29:29,227 --> 00:29:30,812
You don't want help
from the League!

438
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:32,856
Okay?

439
00:29:37,652 --> 00:29:38,987
All right, come on, Zu.

440
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,739
It's time for math class.

441
00:29:46,578 --> 00:29:48,830
Listen. My brother
joined the League first.

442
00:29:48,872 --> 00:29:50,874
And he's always right,
so I joined, too.

443
00:29:50,915 --> 00:29:52,834
They just made us
so many promises.

444
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:55,378
Taught us
how to use our powers.

445
00:29:55,754 --> 00:29:58,548
At first on little things
like dummies, smaller stuff.

446
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,383
Then they showed us
how to break an arm.

447
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:04,471
I didn't sign up
to be a soldier, so I left.

448
00:30:05,764 --> 00:30:07,432
And I'll die before I go back.

449
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,851
They're fighting a war.

450
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,395
Doesn't that require them
to be strong?

451
00:30:12,437 --> 00:30:14,105
Strong, yeah. Cruel? Reckless?

452
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:15,440
No, leave that
to the government.

453
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:17,567
There was nothing cruel
about what she did.

454
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:19,819
She rescued me.
She saved my life.

455
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:21,404
- For what?
- I don't know.

456
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:23,365
I don't know what's going on.

457
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,283
But for the first time
in six years,

458
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:26,618
someone was nice to me.

459
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:28,286
So I'm just saying,
maybe my experience

460
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:29,496
was a little different
from yours.

461
00:30:29,537 --> 00:30:30,872
So why'd you run away
from her?

462
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:33,333
The League's
not your friend, okay?

463
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:36,086
You made the right choice.
Trust me.

464
00:30:36,127 --> 00:30:37,420
Why should I trust you?

465
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:39,339
Whether you trust me or not,
I don't care.

466
00:30:39,673 --> 00:30:40,924
Sooner or later,
you're gonna learn

467
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:43,259
that the only ones
who can help us are us.

468
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:53,269
How could you miss this?

469
00:30:53,311 --> 00:30:55,772
Six years, she roamed free
in these hallways.

470
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:58,692
You have one job to do
and you couldn't even do it.

471
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:01,903
Obviously you have
a problem recognizing

472
00:31:01,945 --> 00:31:03,988
Oranges and Reds
when you see one,

473
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:06,241
so, let's refresh your memory.

474
00:31:08,618 --> 00:31:09,703
Oh...

475
00:31:09,744 --> 00:31:11,246
Let's go, Lieutenant.

476
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:14,916
These two need time
to get reacquainted.

477
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:17,210
No, no, Captain.
Captain, please, don't.

478
00:31:17,252 --> 00:31:18,878
Please. It wasn't my fault!

479
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,255
Captain,
don't close that door!

480
00:31:23,508 --> 00:31:24,801
Oh, God, no.

481
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,764
No!

482
00:31:29,806 --> 00:31:31,266
Put a bounty on that girl.

483
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:32,892
Whatever you need
from the war chest.

484
00:31:32,934 --> 00:31:35,603
Every Tracer out there
better be after her.

485
00:31:39,774 --> 00:31:41,401
We're gonna need
another doctor.

486
00:32:12,724 --> 00:32:13,892
<i>Surprise!</i>

487
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:15,268
<i>Gudetama!</i>

488
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,687
<i>Don't worry anymore,
Mommy and Daddy.</i>

489
00:32:17,729 --> 00:32:19,314
<i>Nothing can take me
away from you.</i>

490
00:32:21,107 --> 00:32:23,485
<i>I'm sorry, Mommy, I'm sorry.</i>

491
00:32:24,361 --> 00:32:26,571
Hey, Ruby, you all right?

492
00:32:30,033 --> 00:32:31,409
What do you want?

493
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:32,952
Nothing, I just, uh...

494
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:34,996
I just wanted
to give you these.

495
00:32:35,372 --> 00:32:36,498
A peace offering.

496
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:38,124
Aren't they yours?

497
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:40,418
Yeah, no. I have
a couple of extra pairs.

498
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,337
And, uh, you don't.

499
00:32:42,796 --> 00:32:43,922
Just take them.

500
00:32:43,963 --> 00:32:45,423
Chubs says your extremities
or whatever

501
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:47,217
are the first things
to get cold.

502
00:32:48,093 --> 00:32:49,552
It's spring, so...

503
00:32:50,553 --> 00:32:51,680
Yeah.

504
00:32:51,721 --> 00:32:53,223
Yeah. But, you know,
you're all...

505
00:32:54,849 --> 00:32:57,352
You need them.
This way you won't...

506
00:32:58,478 --> 00:32:59,479
die.

507
00:32:59,729 --> 00:33:02,273
Oh, God. Ruby,
just take the damn socks

508
00:33:02,315 --> 00:33:03,650
and put him out of his misery.

509
00:33:03,692 --> 00:33:04,818
Shut up, Chubs.

510
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:06,986
You got a way
with the ladies, Liam.

511
00:33:07,654 --> 00:33:09,572
You gotta teach me
your moves someday, pal.

512
00:33:12,534 --> 00:33:14,244
I'm just going
to leave them there.

513
00:33:14,285 --> 00:33:16,079
- Yeah, okay.
- Yeah.

514
00:33:16,913 --> 00:33:18,039
Hey, Liam?

515
00:33:18,498 --> 00:33:19,624
Yes?

516
00:33:21,126 --> 00:33:22,210
Thank you.

517
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:26,089
Yeah.

518
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:56,846
Zu. Hey, Zu.

519
00:34:57,305 --> 00:34:58,306
It's just a dream.

520
00:34:58,932 --> 00:35:00,934
Come here. I got you.

521
00:35:02,102 --> 00:35:03,269
I got you.

522
00:35:03,895 --> 00:35:05,146
Go back to sleep.

523
00:35:06,147 --> 00:35:07,148
Okay.

524
00:35:08,733 --> 00:35:09,818
All right?

525
00:35:18,576 --> 00:35:20,078
Are you okay, Zu?

526
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,083
Okay.

527
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,818
Oh, no. I'm really not
a fancy dress kinda girl.

528
00:35:55,488 --> 00:35:56,698
- Hey.
- Hey.

529
00:36:02,454 --> 00:36:03,747
Where'd you get that?

530
00:36:03,788 --> 00:36:05,290
It's stupid.

531
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:08,418
No, no. It's, uh...

532
00:36:09,336 --> 00:36:11,755
It's been a while since
I've seen a girl in a dress.

533
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:14,549
Or anyone in a dress.

534
00:36:16,134 --> 00:36:18,178
I feel like I should
ask you to prom or something.

535
00:36:18,511 --> 00:36:21,473
Well, unfortunately,
I'm already going with

536
00:36:21,514 --> 00:36:23,600
the captain
of the football team, so...

537
00:36:26,227 --> 00:36:27,270
Conner Jenkins?

538
00:36:27,854 --> 00:36:29,981
Did you just
make that name up?

539
00:36:30,023 --> 00:36:33,526
No, Conner Jenkins
was at Caledonia with me.

540
00:36:33,568 --> 00:36:34,611
He was an idiot, though.

541
00:36:36,738 --> 00:36:39,908
Well, in that case,
gotta dump him.

542
00:36:41,659 --> 00:36:42,577
Oh.

543
00:36:43,078 --> 00:36:44,829
So you're saying
I have a shot?

544
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:49,668
Why don't we start
with scraping

545
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:50,960
these letters
off this minivan

546
00:36:51,002 --> 00:36:52,754
and then we'll see
where it goes from there?

547
00:36:53,296 --> 00:36:54,381
Deal.

548
00:36:57,342 --> 00:36:58,718
So do you always carry
a cocktail dress

549
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,719
when you're on the run?

550
00:37:00,929 --> 00:37:02,514
No, Zu gave it to me.

551
00:37:02,889 --> 00:37:04,140
She likes you.

552
00:37:05,433 --> 00:37:07,435
Careful, though.
She needs girl time so bad...

553
00:37:07,477 --> 00:37:08,728
I think she might
turn you into

554
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:09,979
her own personal
dress-up doll.

555
00:37:13,441 --> 00:37:14,609
Tracers.

556
00:37:27,372 --> 00:37:29,332
Come on, let's just go.

557
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,797
Wait, what just happened?

558
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:37,882
I don't know.

559
00:37:47,225 --> 00:37:49,019
<i>And now
the president's son,</i>

560
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,271
<i>Clancy Gray,
with his message of hope.</i>

561
00:37:51,312 --> 00:37:53,398
<i>If I can be cured,
you can be cured.</i>

562
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,275
Wonder king, Clancy Gray.

563
00:37:56,234 --> 00:37:58,737
"If I can be cured,
you can be cured."

564
00:37:58,778 --> 00:38:00,780
You had
those stupid posters, too?

565
00:38:00,822 --> 00:38:02,490
Seven shades of bullshit.

566
00:38:02,532 --> 00:38:03,700
That's right.

567
00:38:05,118 --> 00:38:08,288
You gotta stop drawing the cats
all over the nines and sixes.

568
00:38:13,293 --> 00:38:15,086
She needs her numbers.

569
00:38:15,545 --> 00:38:16,755
You have to learn.

570
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:20,800
So why are we
at the mall?

571
00:38:22,302 --> 00:38:24,304
Somebody's got to
get supplies, right?

572
00:38:33,438 --> 00:38:34,439
Zu.

573
00:38:35,106 --> 00:38:36,358
Would you do the honors?

574
00:38:44,491 --> 00:38:46,743
Let's go shopping.

575
00:38:52,374 --> 00:38:53,375
You like this?

576
00:39:56,563 --> 00:39:57,772
Whoa!

577
00:40:01,651 --> 00:40:03,445
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

578
00:40:06,781 --> 00:40:08,283
Whoa!

579
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:16,332
Stop!

580
00:40:16,624 --> 00:40:17,625
Whoa!

581
00:41:01,586 --> 00:41:02,712
Hey, hey, hey.

582
00:41:03,338 --> 00:41:04,964
- They're just kids.
- Hey, what the hell?

583
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:07,092
You could have been Tracers.

584
00:41:07,717 --> 00:41:10,136
We're here for supplies.
We're not looking for trouble.

585
00:41:10,178 --> 00:41:13,682
Look. No hard feelings.
We're sorry.

586
00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:15,642
We can give you some food,

587
00:41:15,684 --> 00:41:17,602
and you can sleep here
tonight.

588
00:41:17,644 --> 00:41:18,561
What?

589
00:41:18,603 --> 00:41:20,397
But only tonight.

590
00:41:22,315 --> 00:41:24,484
Last week we scored five pallets
of fresh produce

591
00:41:24,526 --> 00:41:25,777
off a delivery truck.

592
00:41:26,027 --> 00:41:27,278
What do you do with all of it?

593
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,822
I mean,
it's only four of you guys.

594
00:41:28,863 --> 00:41:30,782
We do the work
that needs to be done.

595
00:41:30,824 --> 00:41:32,909
We're the arms and legs
of a greater cause.

596
00:41:33,743 --> 00:41:35,078
Wait, do you know him?

597
00:41:35,662 --> 00:41:38,039
- Know him?
- Yeah, the Slip Kid.

598
00:41:38,081 --> 00:41:40,208
Nah, nobody really knows
the Slip Kid.

599
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,584
We're trying to find his camp.

600
00:41:41,626 --> 00:41:42,752
East River?

601
00:41:42,794 --> 00:41:44,754
- So it's real?
- Sure.

602
00:41:46,756 --> 00:41:48,717
- Where is it?
- I can't tell you.

603
00:41:49,509 --> 00:41:51,511
Come on, dude, you got to be
shittin' me, man! Come on!

604
00:41:51,553 --> 00:41:53,722
They call it a secret
for a reason, pal.

605
00:41:53,763 --> 00:41:55,348
It's one of
the Slip Kid's rules.

606
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:56,725
One hundred percent secrecy.

607
00:41:56,766 --> 00:41:58,560
It's the only way he can keep
all the kids safe.

608
00:42:06,192 --> 00:42:08,361
Do you think
that we've survived this

609
00:42:08,403 --> 00:42:10,196
by following the rules?

610
00:42:10,238 --> 00:42:12,782
Look, we're not just
a bunch of dead weight.

611
00:42:18,705 --> 00:42:20,081
We're powerful.

612
00:42:20,123 --> 00:42:21,750
And we're useful.

613
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:25,837
The Slip Kid
would be lucky to have us.

614
00:42:27,005 --> 00:42:28,131
E.D.O.

615
00:42:28,173 --> 00:42:29,591
Wait, what?

616
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,593
Dude, that is not cool!

617
00:42:31,634 --> 00:42:32,635
What's E.D.O.?

618
00:42:33,053 --> 00:42:34,512
That's all you get.

619
00:42:34,929 --> 00:42:35,930
E.D.O.

620
00:42:38,266 --> 00:42:40,477
"All the world
will be your enemy.

621
00:42:40,518 --> 00:42:42,729
Prince with a thousand enemies.

622
00:42:42,771 --> 00:42:45,690
And whenever they catch you,
they will kill you,

623
00:42:46,107 --> 00:42:48,777
but first they must catch you.

624
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:52,530
Digger, listener, runner.

625
00:42:53,114 --> 00:42:54,908
Prince with a swift warning.

626
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:58,661
Be cunning
and full of tricks

627
00:42:59,245 --> 00:43:02,165
and your people
shall never be destroyed."

628
00:43:07,003 --> 00:43:08,254
Go to sleep.

629
00:43:28,858 --> 00:43:30,151
Hey, Chubs.

630
00:43:30,735 --> 00:43:31,861
It's Charles.

631
00:43:31,903 --> 00:43:32,904
Charles.

632
00:43:35,907 --> 00:43:36,908
What are you doing?

633
00:43:45,041 --> 00:43:46,501
I was afraid
they might steal Betty.

634
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,753
Nice work
getting that clue, by the way.

635
00:43:49,295 --> 00:43:50,463
How'd you do that?

636
00:43:51,256 --> 00:43:52,882
I just asked.

637
00:43:54,134 --> 00:43:57,679
Okay, so, have you figured out
what E.D.O. means?

638
00:43:57,929 --> 00:43:59,639
I have guesses.

639
00:44:00,515 --> 00:44:01,975
I tried Greek, Sumerian

640
00:44:02,017 --> 00:44:04,894
or corresponding placements
in all major alphabets. Nothing.

641
00:44:05,645 --> 00:44:06,813
I even tried pictographs,

642
00:44:06,855 --> 00:44:08,356
and Chinese
military call signs

643
00:44:08,398 --> 00:44:10,483
and sign language. Zip.

644
00:44:10,525 --> 00:44:12,944
There's nothing that leads
to a spot on the map.

645
00:44:12,986 --> 00:44:15,030
Why are you
writing book reports?

646
00:44:15,321 --> 00:44:16,740
They're not book reports.

647
00:44:24,873 --> 00:44:26,958
"I'm out. Can't get to you.

648
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:30,879
Can meet anywhere, name place
and time. Missed you.

649
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,047
Love you."

650
00:44:32,088 --> 00:44:33,506
It's how I got in contact
with my parents

651
00:44:33,548 --> 00:44:34,632
when I was in hiding.

652
00:44:35,592 --> 00:44:38,553
I posted reviews online
with messages.

653
00:44:38,595 --> 00:44:40,764
Your parents must be
really worried about you.

654
00:44:42,974 --> 00:44:45,685
My dad's a doctor.
He saw everything firsthand.

655
00:44:48,146 --> 00:44:49,606
I'm sure he thinks I'm dead.

656
00:44:56,696 --> 00:44:59,074
My dad's
a police detective, so...

657
00:44:59,908 --> 00:45:01,576
he saw everything, too.

658
00:45:12,712 --> 00:45:13,838
Police band.

659
00:45:16,049 --> 00:45:17,550
Wait. What?

660
00:45:18,259 --> 00:45:19,803
Well, think about it,
I mean,

661
00:45:19,844 --> 00:45:21,429
police can talk
to each other on frequencies

662
00:45:21,471 --> 00:45:22,597
only they can listen to.

663
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:24,349
Like UHF, VHF.

664
00:45:24,724 --> 00:45:25,809
You know kids under 17

665
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:27,143
can hear frequencies
adults can't.

666
00:45:27,769 --> 00:45:30,689
That's why the white noise
works on us and not on them.

667
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:34,401
What if E.D.O. isn't a place,
but a frequency?

668
00:45:36,152 --> 00:45:37,153
Okay.

669
00:45:37,862 --> 00:45:39,280
But frequencies are numbers.

670
00:45:40,407 --> 00:45:44,119
E is 5, D is 4, and O is 15.

671
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,704
But...
That doesn't work.

672
00:45:45,745 --> 00:45:47,831
Well, O could just mean,
like, zero.

673
00:45:48,832 --> 00:45:51,167
Five, four, zero.
Five, four, zero.

674
00:45:52,711 --> 00:45:53,795
Got it.

675
00:46:05,432 --> 00:46:07,559
<i>If you can
hear this, you're one of us.</i>

676
00:46:07,976 --> 00:46:11,021
<i>If you're one of us,
you can find us.</i>

677
00:46:11,062 --> 00:46:13,023
<i>Lake Prince, Virginia.</i>

678
00:46:14,315 --> 00:46:15,734
<i>If you can hear this,</i>

679
00:46:15,775 --> 00:46:17,485
<i>- you're one of us.</i>

680
00:46:17,527 --> 00:46:19,904
<i>If you're one of us,
you can find us.</i>

681
00:46:20,363 --> 00:46:21,364
Charles!

682
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:23,825
You did it!

683
00:46:25,744 --> 00:46:26,870
It's Chubs to you.

684
00:46:26,911 --> 00:46:28,371
<i>If you're one of us,
you can find us.</i>

685
00:46:33,752 --> 00:46:36,338
All right. So, we're
going to take the next exit

686
00:46:36,379 --> 00:46:38,840
and a straight shot.

687
00:46:38,882 --> 00:46:39,883
Got it.

688
00:46:41,051 --> 00:46:42,260
To Lake Prince?

689
00:46:45,347 --> 00:46:46,723
It's to your house.

690
00:46:47,432 --> 00:46:48,725
We're taking you home.

691
00:47:12,916 --> 00:47:13,917
Are you sure about this?

692
00:47:17,379 --> 00:47:18,505
Yeah.

693
00:47:20,173 --> 00:47:21,216
No.

694
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:36,147
So if your parents
are there I guess...

695
00:47:36,981 --> 00:47:38,233
I guess this is it.

696
00:47:38,692 --> 00:47:40,318
Yeah, I guess we'll see.

697
00:47:47,367 --> 00:47:49,452
Don't take any candy
from strangers.

698
00:47:52,455 --> 00:47:53,665
Thank you.

699
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:56,376
Yeah.

700
00:48:20,483 --> 00:48:24,279
<i>For six years,
all I wanted was to see them.</i>

701
00:48:27,198 --> 00:48:28,992
<i>But looking
through the window now...</i>

702
00:48:31,244 --> 00:48:32,871
<i>everything feels wrong.</i>

703
00:48:35,415 --> 00:48:38,168
<i>I know what would happen
if I went in there.</i>

704
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:42,130
<i>They wouldn't remember me.</i>

705
00:48:44,674 --> 00:48:46,343
<i>I'd be a stranger.</i>

706
00:48:51,139 --> 00:48:52,390
<i>It was my fault.</i>

707
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:56,853
<i>And because of what I did...</i>

708
00:48:58,688 --> 00:49:00,148
<i>they lost their daughter.</i>

709
00:49:02,692 --> 00:49:04,527
<i>And I lost my family.</i>

710
00:49:45,276 --> 00:49:46,653
You dropped this back there.

711
00:49:47,987 --> 00:49:49,239
I don't want it.

712
00:49:51,825 --> 00:49:52,951
You're lying.

713
00:49:58,331 --> 00:49:59,708
You know, Ruby,
you're not the only one

714
00:49:59,749 --> 00:50:00,875
who's lost someone.

715
00:50:02,544 --> 00:50:03,962
We've all been here.

716
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:07,173
So take this.

717
00:50:07,841 --> 00:50:08,925
This, uh...

718
00:50:09,843 --> 00:50:10,844
What is this?

719
00:50:17,809 --> 00:50:20,562
It's a birthday present
from my dad.

720
00:50:22,147 --> 00:50:23,940
It's the last thing
he gave me.

721
00:50:27,569 --> 00:50:29,654
It used to make me feel
like I wasn't alone.

722
00:50:29,696 --> 00:50:31,281
Hey, you're not alone.

723
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:37,078
I mean,
we're all pretty much orphans.

724
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:40,498
We have each other.

725
00:50:41,958 --> 00:50:43,501
It's kind of like a family.

726
00:50:44,836 --> 00:50:46,546
A dysfunctional family, but...

727
00:50:48,965 --> 00:50:51,217
that's as good as you're
gonna get these days, right?

728
00:50:54,471 --> 00:50:55,513
Right.

729
00:51:13,865 --> 00:51:14,949
Sorry.

730
00:51:21,456 --> 00:51:22,665
It's okay.

731
00:51:23,625 --> 00:51:25,085
One of these days,
you're gonna tell me

732
00:51:25,126 --> 00:51:26,378
all about you, Ruby Daly.

733
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,506
And I can't wait
to hear that story.

734
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:30,882
Until then...

735
00:51:31,424 --> 00:51:34,594
Zu saved
some Twinkies for you.

736
00:51:35,053 --> 00:51:36,054
Come on.

737
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:50,568
Hey, Liam.

738
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:59,077
I love that kids can
hear frequencies adults can't.

739
00:52:00,745 --> 00:52:02,831
There is some good
in getting old, after all.

740
00:52:07,335 --> 00:52:09,254
Took you long enough,
Lady Jane.

741
00:52:09,295 --> 00:52:11,381
Are they gonna dock you
for slacking on the job?

742
00:52:11,423 --> 00:52:14,801
You alone fetch 150,000, baby.
You should be proud.

743
00:52:15,135 --> 00:52:16,219
You've gone up in price

744
00:52:16,261 --> 00:52:17,971
since the last time
I snagged you.

745
00:52:18,013 --> 00:52:19,014
What'd you do?

746
00:52:19,723 --> 00:52:21,182
Start another revolution?

747
00:52:21,516 --> 00:52:23,143
Just let them go,
and you can have me.

748
00:52:23,643 --> 00:52:25,353
I promise
I won't give you any trouble.

749
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:28,940
That's a very
generous offer, Liam,

750
00:52:28,982 --> 00:52:30,984
but considering
I'm the one with a gun,

751
00:52:31,026 --> 00:52:32,277
I think I'm gonna pass.

752
00:52:33,945 --> 00:52:35,864
Who's the little lady?

753
00:52:37,866 --> 00:52:38,992
You first, little girl.
Come on.

754
00:52:51,212 --> 00:52:52,297
Drop it.

755
00:52:54,007 --> 00:52:55,008
And the keys.

756
00:52:58,595 --> 00:53:00,263
Say you're sorry to Zu.

757
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:03,767
I'm sorry, Zu.

758
00:53:04,726 --> 00:53:05,602
Now...

759
00:53:07,103 --> 00:53:09,230
you're gonna walk
into that forest...

760
00:53:11,983 --> 00:53:13,401
and you're gonna keep walking.

761
00:53:14,444 --> 00:53:19,324
No matter how tired
or how hungry you get...

762
00:53:20,825 --> 00:53:21,993
keep walking.

763
00:53:23,078 --> 00:53:25,288
Don't stop.

764
00:53:25,914 --> 00:53:26,915
Ever.

765
00:53:27,749 --> 00:53:28,625
Ever.

766
00:53:51,356 --> 00:53:53,274
Just hear me out.
I don't want to ditch her.

767
00:53:53,316 --> 00:53:54,651
I know
what's better for us.

768
00:53:54,693 --> 00:53:56,111
- Why?
- Because I'm a Green!

769
00:53:56,152 --> 00:53:57,487
I can bank on that fact.

770
00:53:57,529 --> 00:53:58,905
It's too dangerous
with her around.

771
00:53:58,947 --> 00:54:01,574
If we keep driving with her,
they're gonna find us.

772
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:04,661
Look, man, you're getting way
too sentimental about this.

773
00:54:04,703 --> 00:54:06,246
I get it. You have to move on.

774
00:54:06,287 --> 00:54:07,872
You don't know her, okay?

775
00:54:07,914 --> 00:54:09,749
Trust me, I know
what I'm talking about.

776
00:54:09,791 --> 00:54:12,085
This is the right way to go.
You know it.

777
00:54:12,127 --> 00:54:13,378
You just don't want
to part with her.

778
00:54:13,795 --> 00:54:16,047
- But it's the best decision.
- So why are we doing it?

779
00:54:16,089 --> 00:54:18,174
I don't want to leave her.
I don't want to just dump her.

780
00:54:18,216 --> 00:54:19,884
We're being watched
heavily all the time.

781
00:54:19,926 --> 00:54:21,011
Hey, I'm just gonna go.

782
00:54:21,511 --> 00:54:23,263
So, you can stop fighting.

783
00:54:23,972 --> 00:54:27,225
And I'm really sorry
that I lied to you.

784
00:54:31,104 --> 00:54:32,230
Ruby.

785
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:37,777
- Ruby.
- I just forgot my bag, okay?

786
00:54:37,819 --> 00:54:39,237
We were talking about
damn Betty,

787
00:54:39,279 --> 00:54:40,488
not your Orange ass.

788
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:42,866
And for the record,

789
00:54:43,158 --> 00:54:45,076
I knew you were Orange
since day zero.

790
00:54:48,204 --> 00:54:49,414
Sit down.

791
00:54:53,543 --> 00:54:57,172
I just... didn't want you
to be afraid of me.

792
00:54:58,006 --> 00:55:00,300
There's nothing wrong
with being Orange.

793
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,385
I can't even control it.

794
00:55:03,928 --> 00:55:07,057
I'm trying to figure it out,
but it just happens.

795
00:55:07,098 --> 00:55:08,683
Sometimes all it takes
is my skin

796
00:55:08,725 --> 00:55:10,643
brushing up
against someone else

797
00:55:10,935 --> 00:55:12,562
and I'm in their head.

798
00:55:13,271 --> 00:55:15,023
And the more
that I try to pull free,

799
00:55:15,065 --> 00:55:17,442
the more damage that I do.

800
00:55:17,484 --> 00:55:18,360
Damage?

801
00:55:26,117 --> 00:55:28,203
Is that why
you didn't wanna kiss me?

802
00:55:29,162 --> 00:55:30,246
Yeah.

803
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,376
Okay.

804
00:55:34,959 --> 00:55:37,420
Well, touching
as this moment is, uh,

805
00:55:37,671 --> 00:55:39,255
we have a Slip Kid
to party with, right?

806
00:55:39,297 --> 00:55:40,340
- We do, yeah.
- Let's go.

807
00:55:40,382 --> 00:55:42,092
Yeah, we're not far now.
Hey, Zu.

808
00:55:42,133 --> 00:55:43,843
We're packing up.

809
00:55:45,345 --> 00:55:46,429
Gotta go.

810
00:55:46,763 --> 00:55:49,015
Unless you wanna try
and run away again.

811
00:55:49,057 --> 00:55:50,058
No.

812
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:51,643
I'll keep trying to stop you.

813
00:55:52,018 --> 00:55:53,186
Come on.

814
00:55:58,733 --> 00:56:00,944
Ah, it feels like we
should do something for her.

815
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:04,948
Like a barge out to sea.
Set her on fire.

816
00:56:06,574 --> 00:56:07,742
Blaze of glory.

817
00:56:08,535 --> 00:56:09,869
She's a minivan...

818
00:56:10,704 --> 00:56:11,788
not a Viking.

819
00:56:29,139 --> 00:56:30,724
Woo!

820
00:56:32,642 --> 00:56:33,643
Man.

821
00:57:01,713 --> 00:57:03,673
I don't know, Chubs.
It doesn't feel right.

822
00:57:04,299 --> 00:57:06,468
Man, y'all are just
a bunch of negative nellies.

823
00:57:11,264 --> 00:57:12,432
Check it, man.

824
00:57:17,103 --> 00:57:19,898
E. D. O.

825
00:57:21,024 --> 00:57:22,859
- E.D.O.
- E.D.O., man.

826
00:57:22,901 --> 00:57:24,027
Oh, my God.

827
00:57:24,986 --> 00:57:26,738
All right, let's go!

828
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:34,704
Stay on your knees!

829
00:57:36,081 --> 00:57:37,582
Head to the ground!

830
00:57:39,125 --> 00:57:40,960
- Hey, we're not armed.
- Save it, asshole.

831
00:57:41,002 --> 00:57:42,212
Hold on.

832
00:57:42,921 --> 00:57:43,797
Liam Stewart?

833
00:57:46,049 --> 00:57:48,134
- Mike?
- Everybody, stand down.

834
00:57:49,177 --> 00:57:51,179
Jesus. I'm sorry, Liam.
I didn't know it was you.

835
00:57:51,221 --> 00:57:52,305
It's okay.

836
00:57:53,014 --> 00:57:54,349
Wait, I thought
you were with Josh?

837
00:57:54,391 --> 00:57:55,392
I was.

838
00:57:55,642 --> 00:57:56,935
I made it through the fields.

839
00:57:57,936 --> 00:57:59,062
Thanks to you.

840
00:58:01,564 --> 00:58:03,692
- Wait, are you looking for--
- You found it.

841
00:58:03,733 --> 00:58:05,110
Oh.

842
00:58:05,151 --> 00:58:06,361
Welcome home.

843
00:58:06,403 --> 00:58:08,863
Finally! I told you, man.

844
00:58:08,905 --> 00:58:10,198
Told you!

845
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:14,452
This is it.

846
00:58:24,546 --> 00:58:25,547
Come on, guys.

847
00:58:27,799 --> 00:58:29,759
Everyone looks so happy here.

848
00:58:29,801 --> 00:58:32,012
Yeah, we don't segregate
by colors here.

849
00:58:32,053 --> 00:58:35,890
We respect our differences,
but we're all the same.

850
00:58:36,224 --> 00:58:38,018
Now, let's go.

851
00:58:38,476 --> 00:58:39,978
It's time to meet
the Slip Kid.

852
00:58:54,534 --> 00:58:56,369
You gotta be kidding me!

853
00:58:56,745 --> 00:58:57,787
Clancy Gray?

854
00:58:58,163 --> 00:58:59,998
I knew you weren't reformed.

855
00:59:02,292 --> 00:59:03,668
You're Charles, right?

856
00:59:05,337 --> 00:59:07,505
And you must be Suzume. Hey.

857
00:59:09,841 --> 00:59:10,925
And Liam Stewart.

858
00:59:11,301 --> 00:59:13,845
The hero who broke
a hundred kids out of Caledonia.

859
00:59:15,638 --> 00:59:16,931
Ruby Daly.

860
00:59:16,973 --> 00:59:18,808
The last remaining Orange
other than me.

861
00:59:19,351 --> 00:59:20,643
It's an honor to meet you.

862
00:59:20,977 --> 00:59:23,688
I'm honestly excited to meet
all of you guys.

863
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:25,398
I mean,
you're kind of legendary.

864
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:26,733
You're so welcome.

865
00:59:28,443 --> 00:59:30,111
Now, there's a lot
to be done here

866
00:59:30,153 --> 00:59:32,655
and we could really use
your guys' help.

867
00:59:33,281 --> 00:59:35,658
I'm thinking cabin 18.

868
00:59:36,117 --> 00:59:37,077
Yes, sir.

869
00:59:37,118 --> 00:59:38,411
Go get settled.

870
00:59:38,453 --> 00:59:40,080
We're gonna have
some fun tonight.

871
00:59:40,121 --> 00:59:41,247
Bye.

872
00:59:58,014 --> 01:00:00,266
Wow, floating lanterns.

873
01:00:00,308 --> 01:00:01,893
This is like Hogwarts.

874
01:00:01,935 --> 01:00:03,061
Yeah.

875
01:00:06,356 --> 01:00:08,483
Oh, wait, that would make you
Harry, right?

876
01:00:09,609 --> 01:00:15,073
And me Hermione
or Ginny Weasley, right?

877
01:00:16,408 --> 01:00:17,575
Probably.

878
01:00:18,201 --> 01:00:19,994
Well, Harry and Ginny
end up together.

879
01:00:20,036 --> 01:00:21,830
Yeah.

880
01:00:22,831 --> 01:00:25,417
Oh, no, I didn't mean...

881
01:00:27,419 --> 01:00:28,628
You know what?

882
01:00:29,212 --> 01:00:30,797
I really like them together.

883
01:00:40,515 --> 01:00:41,933
We should dance.

884
01:00:43,393 --> 01:00:45,145
- No.
- Yeah.

885
01:00:45,186 --> 01:00:46,354
- No.
- No?

886
01:00:57,407 --> 01:00:58,783
It's okay, I won't hurt you.

887
01:00:58,825 --> 01:00:59,951
I know.

888
01:00:59,993 --> 01:01:01,703
Oh, that's right,
you're the mind reader.

889
01:01:01,745 --> 01:01:03,413
I can't read minds.

890
01:01:03,455 --> 01:01:05,707
I can barely understand
my own thoughts.

891
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:22,182
You're really beautiful.

892
01:01:22,932 --> 01:01:24,142
What?

893
01:01:24,184 --> 01:01:27,354
I just said you're...
You're really beautiful.

894
01:02:11,523 --> 01:02:12,691
Clancy?

895
01:02:12,732 --> 01:02:13,733
Come in!

896
01:02:23,159 --> 01:02:24,160
Hey.

897
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:26,121
Hi.

898
01:02:27,997 --> 01:02:29,958
Mike didn't give me
a work assignment

899
01:02:29,999 --> 01:02:31,876
and said to come and see you,
so...

900
01:02:31,918 --> 01:02:33,503
You do have a work assignment.

901
01:02:34,713 --> 01:02:35,964
Well, what is it?

902
01:02:36,381 --> 01:02:37,507
You're gonna work with me.

903
01:02:38,925 --> 01:02:41,553
Please. There's something
I need to show you.

904
01:02:43,138 --> 01:02:44,264
Come on.

905
01:02:52,689 --> 01:02:54,941
I was one
of the first survivors.

906
01:02:54,983 --> 01:02:56,901
<i>They used me
as their test monkey.</i>

907
01:02:57,902 --> 01:02:59,738
<i>Trying to find a cure
that didn't exist.</i>

908
01:03:00,238 --> 01:03:01,448
Dad!

909
01:03:01,489 --> 01:03:03,491
<i>My father didn't care.
He sanctioned it.</i>

910
01:03:03,950 --> 01:03:06,119
<i>When the doctors
came up empty-handed,</i>

911
01:03:06,161 --> 01:03:09,414
<i>my father just said
I was cured.</i>

912
01:03:09,456 --> 01:03:10,957
Please, stop!

913
01:03:10,999 --> 01:03:12,500
<i>- I knew I wasn't cured.</i>

914
01:03:13,626 --> 01:03:14,919
<i>He wouldn't listen.</i>

915
01:03:16,296 --> 01:03:17,797
<i>I lost my family.</i>

916
01:03:18,131 --> 01:03:20,008
Dad!

917
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:21,760
<i>I lost everything.</i>

918
01:03:24,679 --> 01:03:26,639
But if he knows
we can't be fixed--

919
01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:29,017
He'll never stop trying
to fix us.

920
01:03:29,059 --> 01:03:30,101
Why?

921
01:03:30,143 --> 01:03:31,561
Because he's afraid of us.

922
01:03:31,603 --> 01:03:33,605
Maybe he has a reason to be.

923
01:03:34,189 --> 01:03:36,858
Never be ashamed
of who you are, Ruby.

924
01:03:38,193 --> 01:03:40,028
Now, I know how scary it is...

925
01:03:41,821 --> 01:03:43,698
to not be able
to touch someone.

926
01:03:44,407 --> 01:03:45,950
To never be able to go home.

927
01:03:47,786 --> 01:03:49,746
But I can show you
how to use your strengths

928
01:03:49,788 --> 01:03:51,164
the way
they're meant to be used.

929
01:03:52,916 --> 01:03:54,250
How to control them.

930
01:03:56,252 --> 01:03:57,837
Otherwise they control you.

931
01:03:59,589 --> 01:04:01,049
And I won't hurt anyone?

932
01:04:02,509 --> 01:04:03,927
Not unless you want to.

933
01:04:07,639 --> 01:04:08,848
Teach me.

934
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:12,644
<i>Everyone has a place
in the world.</i>

935
01:04:13,978 --> 01:04:16,064
<i>A responsibility. A purpose.</i>

936
01:04:17,148 --> 01:04:19,025
<i>Here, you can discover
what that is.</i>

937
01:04:20,193 --> 01:04:22,862
<i>Learning how to use your power
is just the beginning.</i>

938
01:04:23,863 --> 01:04:25,699
<i>Learning to use it
for a cause...</i>

939
01:04:26,991 --> 01:04:28,743
<i>that's what I'll teach you.</i>

940
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:30,829
Okay, now,
without touching me,

941
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:32,539
and without saying a word...

942
01:04:33,081 --> 01:04:34,416
put a thought into my head.

943
01:04:36,543 --> 01:04:37,711
Okay.

944
01:04:38,128 --> 01:04:39,129
Focus.

945
01:04:40,005 --> 01:04:41,256
Concentrate.

946
01:04:43,466 --> 01:04:44,718
Try harder.

947
01:04:46,428 --> 01:04:47,721
- Sorry.
- Don't be.

948
01:04:48,346 --> 01:04:49,389
It takes time.

949
01:04:49,973 --> 01:04:51,099
Go again.

950
01:04:51,141 --> 01:04:52,142
Okay.

951
01:04:54,477 --> 01:04:57,188
<i>All of us
have lost families.</i>

952
01:04:58,189 --> 01:04:59,357
<i>Homes.</i>

953
01:05:00,358 --> 01:05:01,568
<i>Childhood.</i>

954
01:05:03,028 --> 01:05:04,404
<i>We can get them back.</i>

955
01:05:06,239 --> 01:05:09,034
<i>And you and I were brought
together for a reason.</i>

956
01:05:09,367 --> 01:05:11,369
<i>We're the only ones
strong enough</i>

957
01:05:11,411 --> 01:05:13,329
<i>to create a better place
for all of us.</i>

958
01:05:13,371 --> 01:05:15,623
Sorry, but no one
can leave right now.

959
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:20,170
<i>Where we
don't have to be afraid.</i>

960
01:05:22,339 --> 01:05:25,091
<i>Where no one
can take away what's ours.</i>

961
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:28,345
You can't control something
that scares you.

962
01:05:29,763 --> 01:05:31,806
The fear's
always gonna get in the way.

963
01:05:32,349 --> 01:05:34,476
- Let's try again.
- Okay.

964
01:05:34,517 --> 01:05:35,769
Just like I taught you.

965
01:05:37,228 --> 01:05:38,396
But first...

966
01:05:39,397 --> 01:05:41,149
<i>you need to be stronger.</i>

967
01:05:41,816 --> 01:05:45,070
<i>You need to be able
to fight beside me as an equal.</i>

968
01:05:45,111 --> 01:05:48,281
<i>Only then can we change
what's in everyone's minds.</i>

969
01:05:48,323 --> 01:05:51,076
Man, you just don't pull
the pepper right off the plant.

970
01:05:51,117 --> 01:05:52,577
<i>And give us a future.</i>

971
01:05:52,619 --> 01:05:54,913
Which is why you have janky,
ripped-up peppers.

972
01:05:55,246 --> 01:05:57,457
And wouldn't you rather have
red peppers anyways?

973
01:05:57,499 --> 01:05:59,042
I mean, they're high
on vitamin C.

974
01:05:59,084 --> 01:06:00,669
We don't have a choice,
you idiot.

975
01:06:00,710 --> 01:06:01,753
These are green peppers.

976
01:06:01,795 --> 01:06:03,088
- Now it's your turn.
- Really?

977
01:06:03,421 --> 01:06:05,465
Red peppers and green peppers
are the same thing, dipshit.

978
01:06:05,507 --> 01:06:07,467
Listen,
I'm the garden guy.

979
01:06:07,509 --> 01:06:10,261
I know what vegetables
grow in this garden.

980
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:11,554
And if I woulda...

981
01:06:13,973 --> 01:06:15,225
You're right.

982
01:06:15,642 --> 01:06:18,520
We should really wait for these
to mature into red peppers.

983
01:06:18,561 --> 01:06:20,605
We need all the vitamin C
we can get.

984
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:31,324
Well done.

985
01:06:39,708 --> 01:06:42,043
<i>Ruby, you're still
holding back.</i>

986
01:06:42,794 --> 01:06:44,629
Why are you so afraid
of who you are?

987
01:06:46,381 --> 01:06:47,507
What happened?

988
01:06:48,758 --> 01:06:50,719
I've never told anyone.

989
01:06:51,261 --> 01:06:52,595
Of course you haven't.

990
01:06:53,179 --> 01:06:55,056
Only another Orange
could understand.

991
01:06:56,224 --> 01:06:57,475
<i>Let me in.</i>

992
01:06:58,309 --> 01:06:59,644
<i>You can't hurt me.</i>

993
01:07:06,317 --> 01:07:07,402
It's okay.

994
01:07:14,409 --> 01:07:15,660
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

995
01:07:16,327 --> 01:07:17,454
Gudetama!

996
01:07:17,495 --> 01:07:18,496
Surprise!

997
01:07:24,461 --> 01:07:26,713
Don't worry anymore,
Mommy and Daddy.

998
01:07:35,388 --> 01:07:37,015
<i>Gudetama!</i>

999
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:39,309
<i>Mommy, what's wrong?</i>

1000
01:07:39,351 --> 01:07:41,061
I am not your mommy.

1001
01:07:44,314 --> 01:07:45,565
You erased yourself.

1002
01:07:46,775 --> 01:07:47,901
Yes.

1003
01:07:48,234 --> 01:07:50,528
I didn't want them
to worry about me.

1004
01:07:51,321 --> 01:07:53,114
And so, I guess I just...

1005
01:07:56,368 --> 01:07:58,161
I took away me.

1006
01:07:59,579 --> 01:08:00,705
I was just a little kid.

1007
01:08:00,747 --> 01:08:03,083
I had no clue
what I was doing.

1008
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:06,419
I just wish I could fix it.

1009
01:08:06,753 --> 01:08:08,338
You have a gift.

1010
01:08:09,547 --> 01:08:11,257
Beyond mine.

1011
01:08:13,051 --> 01:08:14,636
I don't know how to do
what you've done,

1012
01:08:14,678 --> 01:08:16,096
let alone reverse it.

1013
01:08:17,097 --> 01:08:18,390
But we'll figure it out.

1014
01:08:18,848 --> 01:08:20,058
Together.

1015
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:24,396
What?

1016
01:08:28,066 --> 01:08:30,485
I have just never met
someone like you.

1017
01:08:33,697 --> 01:08:35,198
Someone like me.

1018
01:08:46,501 --> 01:08:48,086
Hey, Ruby.

1019
01:08:53,508 --> 01:08:54,509
Hey.

1020
01:08:55,301 --> 01:08:56,302
How was it?

1021
01:08:56,344 --> 01:08:58,638
Um...
Intense.

1022
01:09:00,348 --> 01:09:01,725
You two
are getting pretty close.

1023
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:03,226
What does that mean?

1024
01:09:03,476 --> 01:09:05,311
Why couldn't you tell me
the truth?

1025
01:09:06,813 --> 01:09:08,064
Why are you so scared of me?

1026
01:09:08,106 --> 01:09:09,607
I'm not scared of you.

1027
01:09:09,649 --> 01:09:10,984
I'm trying not to hurt you.

1028
01:09:11,026 --> 01:09:12,360
Ruby, I don't care
if our skin touches,

1029
01:09:12,402 --> 01:09:13,570
and you know everything
about me.

1030
01:09:13,611 --> 01:09:16,281
I don't want to do to you
what I did to my parents.

1031
01:09:16,322 --> 01:09:17,449
No. I'm never gonna
forget you!

1032
01:09:17,490 --> 01:09:18,658
You can't make
that promise, Liam.

1033
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:19,826
You can't help me.

1034
01:09:19,868 --> 01:09:22,162
You're not an Orange.
We're not the same.

1035
01:09:29,294 --> 01:09:30,337
Wait, Liam.

1036
01:09:41,848 --> 01:09:42,974
Liam!

1037
01:10:00,283 --> 01:10:01,409
Hey.

1038
01:10:02,744 --> 01:10:04,579
Wow. You caught me
staring at a lake.

1039
01:10:05,121 --> 01:10:06,790
I've officially become
my grandma.

1040
01:10:12,545 --> 01:10:13,755
So what's going on?

1041
01:10:14,381 --> 01:10:15,507
Nothing.

1042
01:10:16,966 --> 01:10:21,179
Things are just getting
a little... weird around here.

1043
01:10:22,597 --> 01:10:23,723
Yeah.

1044
01:10:25,725 --> 01:10:27,852
Kinda wish we were
all back in the van.

1045
01:10:28,353 --> 01:10:31,106
Tell me about it.

1046
01:10:31,147 --> 01:10:32,732
This place is horrible.

1047
01:10:34,109 --> 01:10:36,236
We're told when to eat,
when to sleep...

1048
01:10:37,028 --> 01:10:38,446
and we're forced to work.

1049
01:10:39,364 --> 01:10:42,033
How is this place
any different from the camps?

1050
01:10:42,075 --> 01:10:43,451
Where else would we go?

1051
01:10:44,619 --> 01:10:45,662
Home.

1052
01:10:46,121 --> 01:10:48,707
Home? Really?

1053
01:10:48,748 --> 01:10:50,166
At least I'd be with my books.

1054
01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:52,836
My dog, if--
If he's still around.

1055
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:54,671
My parents.

1056
01:11:19,988 --> 01:11:20,989
Hey, Clancy?

1057
01:11:22,615 --> 01:11:25,827
I was wondering if
I could ask you for a favor.

1058
01:11:26,161 --> 01:11:27,037
Sure.

1059
01:11:27,662 --> 01:11:30,040
Okay, so, I was hoping
that you could let

1060
01:11:30,081 --> 01:11:32,083
Chubs use your computer

1061
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:34,002
to contact his parents.
He's done it before.

1062
01:11:34,044 --> 01:11:35,795
It's very safe and coded.

1063
01:11:35,837 --> 01:11:37,714
- He just needs access--
- No. I'm sorry.

1064
01:11:37,756 --> 01:11:39,257
He just wants
to contact his parents

1065
01:11:39,299 --> 01:11:40,675
and let them know
that he's okay.

1066
01:11:40,925 --> 01:11:43,261
I mean, it's obvious he's
not a fan of this place,

1067
01:11:43,303 --> 01:11:44,262
I don't doubt for a second

1068
01:11:44,304 --> 01:11:45,805
that he'd tell his parents
our location.

1069
01:11:45,847 --> 01:11:46,890
He's not stupid.

1070
01:11:46,931 --> 01:11:49,309
He's, like, the smartest person
I've ever met.

1071
01:11:52,312 --> 01:11:53,271
All right.

1072
01:11:54,397 --> 01:11:57,192
- Really?
- But first, you teach me.

1073
01:11:58,360 --> 01:11:59,736
What do you want me
to teach you?

1074
01:12:00,195 --> 01:12:01,279
I wanna know how to do

1075
01:12:01,321 --> 01:12:02,697
what you did
with your parents.

1076
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:05,492
How to erase yourself
from someone's memory.

1077
01:12:05,992 --> 01:12:08,828
Clancy, I told you.
I don't know how I did that.

1078
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:09,871
I know.

1079
01:12:10,705 --> 01:12:12,499
But if you let me walk through
your memories,

1080
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:14,167
then maybe
I can figure it out.

1081
01:12:15,585 --> 01:12:17,420
If we can figure out
how you did it,

1082
01:12:17,462 --> 01:12:20,298
then maybe we can figure out
how to undo it.

1083
01:12:22,592 --> 01:12:24,469
And you'll let Chubs
use your computer?

1084
01:12:24,511 --> 01:12:25,428
Yeah.

1085
01:12:27,263 --> 01:12:28,306
Okay.

1086
01:12:30,475 --> 01:12:31,601
Great.

1087
01:12:32,727 --> 01:12:35,188
Okay. Now, close your eyes...

1088
01:12:35,897 --> 01:12:37,190
think about your parents.

1089
01:12:44,155 --> 01:12:46,533
Go back to the night
of your 10th birthday.

1090
01:13:14,227 --> 01:13:16,271
<i>Don't worry anymore,
Mommy and Daddy.</i>

1091
01:13:16,312 --> 01:13:18,606
<i>Nothing can take me
away from you.</i>

1092
01:13:47,510 --> 01:13:49,804
- Stop! What are you doing?
- Shh! Just relax.

1093
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:52,640
It's okay, Ruby.
I won't hurt you.

1094
01:13:57,979 --> 01:13:59,522
Don't worry.

1095
01:13:59,564 --> 01:14:01,066
Now that I know how,
I'll just erase

1096
01:14:01,107 --> 01:14:02,567
this part
and we can start over.

1097
01:14:12,952 --> 01:14:14,079
Ruby, what are you doing here?

1098
01:14:14,913 --> 01:14:16,373
Nothing,
I just want to be alone.

1099
01:14:16,414 --> 01:14:17,665
Well, you're crying.

1100
01:14:17,707 --> 01:14:19,000
No, I'm not.
Please, just go away.

1101
01:14:19,042 --> 01:14:20,168
What happened?

1102
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:21,795
I don't want
to tell you, Liam.

1103
01:14:21,836 --> 01:14:23,046
Why can't you
just leave me alone?

1104
01:14:23,088 --> 01:14:24,964
I don't want you to be alone.
Tell me what's going on.

1105
01:14:25,006 --> 01:14:26,216
- Stop!
- Ruby!

1106
01:14:26,257 --> 01:14:27,926
- Stop!
- Ruby!

1107
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:29,260
Stop it!

1108
01:14:31,262 --> 01:14:32,806
<i>Stop! What are you doing?</i>

1109
01:14:32,847 --> 01:14:33,848
<i>Shh! Just relax.</i>

1110
01:14:34,974 --> 01:14:37,519
<i>It's okay, Ruby.
I won't hurt you.</i>

1111
01:14:39,270 --> 01:14:40,605
I'll kill him.

1112
01:14:41,272 --> 01:14:42,399
Liam, wait.

1113
01:14:45,276 --> 01:14:46,528
Let's just leave.

1114
01:14:54,953 --> 01:14:56,496
- I'll get Zu.
- Okay.

1115
01:14:56,538 --> 01:14:58,164
Chubs, we gotta go.

1116
01:14:58,206 --> 01:14:59,249
Hey, Zu. Wake up.

1117
01:14:59,290 --> 01:15:00,625
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did I miss something?

1118
01:15:00,667 --> 01:15:01,960
The four of us are leaving
right now.

1119
01:15:02,002 --> 01:15:03,420
It's about damn time!

1120
01:15:07,132 --> 01:15:08,299
Through here.

1121
01:15:10,552 --> 01:15:12,220
Come on.
This way's not guarded.

1122
01:15:25,108 --> 01:15:26,484
Look who's here.

1123
01:15:28,278 --> 01:15:29,612
Our little fugitive.

1124
01:15:31,614 --> 01:15:33,700
Get out of here.

1125
01:15:37,787 --> 01:15:38,788
Liam.

1126
01:15:39,622 --> 01:15:40,790
Liam, come on.

1127
01:15:42,542 --> 01:15:44,461
He can't hear you, Ruby.

1128
01:15:47,255 --> 01:15:48,590
Clancy?

1129
01:15:48,631 --> 01:15:49,883
He's with them.

1130
01:15:51,343 --> 01:15:52,469
Oh, shit!

1131
01:15:53,219 --> 01:15:54,220
They're rounding us up.

1132
01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:56,931
Get up, you asshole.

1133
01:15:58,725 --> 01:16:00,352
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

1134
01:16:00,393 --> 01:16:01,519
How's my dad?

1135
01:16:01,561 --> 01:16:05,065
Enjoying your old padded cell.

1136
01:16:07,025 --> 01:16:08,276
Anyway, we got kids
to round up.

1137
01:16:08,318 --> 01:16:09,944
Lots of new recruits
for my army.

1138
01:16:10,820 --> 01:16:12,155
- Call the birds.
- Ruby, we gotta go.

1139
01:16:12,197 --> 01:16:13,615
Already en route, sir.

1140
01:16:17,327 --> 01:16:18,453
I liked you, Ruby.

1141
01:16:19,954 --> 01:16:21,122
I really did.

1142
01:16:21,706 --> 01:16:24,501
So believe me when I say
I am broken up about this.

1143
01:16:26,670 --> 01:16:29,339
I'm just... trying to make
this miserable world

1144
01:16:29,381 --> 01:16:31,174
a place where
we don't have to be afraid.

1145
01:16:31,716 --> 01:16:33,551
Where those who are special,
like you and me,

1146
01:16:33,593 --> 01:16:35,261
can be the ones in charge.

1147
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:38,723
And you'd rather run around
the woods with this guy?

1148
01:16:40,767 --> 01:16:41,768
Stop!

1149
01:16:43,978 --> 01:16:47,065
No one takes what's mine.

1150
01:16:48,483 --> 01:16:49,484
Stop!

1151
01:16:50,276 --> 01:16:51,528
Not my father.

1152
01:16:51,986 --> 01:16:52,987
Not anyone.

1153
01:16:54,197 --> 01:16:55,657
And certainly not you.

1154
01:16:56,866 --> 01:16:57,867
Stop!

1155
01:16:59,285 --> 01:17:00,954
You know what sucks, Ruby?

1156
01:17:02,414 --> 01:17:04,207
We could've been leading
an army together.

1157
01:17:05,208 --> 01:17:07,585
Punishing everyone
whoever hurt us.

1158
01:17:08,253 --> 01:17:09,713
Now look where we are.

1159
01:17:12,007 --> 01:17:13,591
My hand hurts, take over.

1160
01:17:13,633 --> 01:17:14,676
Gladly.

1161
01:17:15,468 --> 01:17:16,886
Stop!

1162
01:17:17,971 --> 01:17:19,139
Stop!

1163
01:17:19,180 --> 01:17:20,974
Now, I can find it in my heart
to forgive you.

1164
01:17:21,016 --> 01:17:22,684
- Don't!
- It's not up to you.

1165
01:17:23,226 --> 01:17:24,853
You've shown me
how to fix you.

1166
01:17:25,395 --> 01:17:26,771
And once I've erased
all the parts

1167
01:17:26,813 --> 01:17:28,356
I don't like,
you'll do whatever I want.

1168
01:17:28,398 --> 01:17:29,691
Stop! You'll kill him!

1169
01:17:30,191 --> 01:17:31,568
No, I won't.

1170
01:17:33,028 --> 01:17:34,320
I want him alive.

1171
01:17:34,738 --> 01:17:36,656
To see exactly
what you become.

1172
01:17:37,782 --> 01:17:39,075
Go to hell!

1173
01:17:47,042 --> 01:17:48,168
Zu, lights!

1174
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:01,431
Get them, go!

1175
01:18:10,357 --> 01:18:12,192
Open the hatch.
Drop the package.

1176
01:18:47,227 --> 01:18:48,228
Reds!

1177
01:18:54,317 --> 01:18:55,318
Run!

1178
01:20:12,020 --> 01:20:13,188
Go, go, go!

1179
01:20:13,229 --> 01:20:14,397
I'm not leaving you.

1180
01:20:14,439 --> 01:20:16,566
You can't fight him! I can.

1181
01:20:18,651 --> 01:20:21,613
I can.
Zu, go with Liam.

1182
01:20:21,654 --> 01:20:22,655
Zu, go!

1183
01:20:23,281 --> 01:20:24,532
Liam, they need you.

1184
01:20:25,116 --> 01:20:26,284
Trust me.

1185
01:20:27,118 --> 01:20:29,829
Now, go!
Save as many as you can.

1186
01:20:29,871 --> 01:20:31,748
Come on, come on.
Let's go! This way.

1187
01:20:32,165 --> 01:20:33,291
Come on. We gotta go!

1188
01:20:33,333 --> 01:20:34,751
Everybody, come on.
Let's go!

1189
01:20:34,793 --> 01:20:36,044
- This way!
- Come on! Run!

1190
01:21:34,436 --> 01:21:35,603
It's okay, Ruby.

1191
01:21:36,146 --> 01:21:38,690
Stop fighting. Let me in.

1192
01:21:38,732 --> 01:21:41,985
Let me take
all those sad and angry

1193
01:21:42,027 --> 01:21:43,820
thoughts and make them
go away.

1194
01:21:43,862 --> 01:21:46,990
I can prune and snip
and rewrite you now

1195
01:21:47,032 --> 01:21:48,283
into a better Ruby.

1196
01:21:51,119 --> 01:21:52,412
The perfect Ruby.

1197
01:21:52,912 --> 01:21:55,915
The Ruby I want you to be.

1198
01:22:12,974 --> 01:22:14,976
I kinda like how I am.

1199
01:22:18,646 --> 01:22:20,565
What are you doing?
Pull up! Pull up!

1200
01:22:43,004 --> 01:22:46,716
<i>Bird down, bird down.
Unknown hostile.</i>

1201
01:22:50,553 --> 01:22:51,763
Ruby!

1202
01:23:42,272 --> 01:23:43,440
Where's Liam and Zu?

1203
01:23:43,481 --> 01:23:44,816
I don't know.

1204
01:23:44,858 --> 01:23:46,651
Chubs, we have
to get out of here.

1205
01:23:46,693 --> 01:23:48,486
Go, save yourself.

1206
01:23:48,528 --> 01:23:49,821
We have to get you help!

1207
01:23:49,863 --> 01:23:51,322
It's not happening.

1208
01:24:06,921 --> 01:24:08,256
Hey, what are you doing?

1209
01:24:09,007 --> 01:24:10,300
What is that?

1210
01:24:11,051 --> 01:24:12,260
It's help.

1211
01:24:24,481 --> 01:24:26,066
You're gonna be okay.

1212
01:24:39,079 --> 01:24:40,288
Chubs?

1213
01:24:45,585 --> 01:24:47,003
Come on, Chubs.

1214
01:24:49,172 --> 01:24:50,423
Ruby!

1215
01:24:54,302 --> 01:24:55,929
I knew you were okay.

1216
01:24:57,931 --> 01:25:00,558
Liam, you have to get out
of here right now.

1217
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:01,685
Oh, Jesus.

1218
01:25:02,769 --> 01:25:04,270
I'll grab his legs.

1219
01:25:04,312 --> 01:25:06,564
I got Zu to a group of kids.
She's gonna be safe.

1220
01:25:06,606 --> 01:25:07,649
Liam. He needs a hospital.

1221
01:25:07,691 --> 01:25:09,484
Yeah, we'll find one, a vet,
somebody. Come on.

1222
01:25:09,526 --> 01:25:11,319
Liam, we can't fix this.

1223
01:25:24,582 --> 01:25:26,167
I called someone who can.

1224
01:25:33,133 --> 01:25:34,134
The League?

1225
01:25:34,884 --> 01:25:37,262
- No, Ruby.
- "The enemy of my enemy."

1226
01:25:37,303 --> 01:25:38,680
You don't know
what they're like.

1227
01:25:38,722 --> 01:25:39,973
You have to get out of here.

1228
01:25:40,265 --> 01:25:42,142
The League is coming,
and they don't trust you.

1229
01:25:42,183 --> 01:25:43,351
They won't take you back.

1230
01:25:52,944 --> 01:25:54,029
I'm staying.

1231
01:25:54,070 --> 01:25:55,405
- Please, Liam, you have to go.
- No.

1232
01:25:58,366 --> 01:25:59,659
We're family, remember?

1233
01:26:02,287 --> 01:26:03,788
I'm not leaving you.

1234
01:27:07,977 --> 01:27:09,354
It's good to see you again.

1235
01:27:11,690 --> 01:27:13,024
Ruby, you're safe here.

1236
01:27:13,066 --> 01:27:14,484
The League owns this house.

1237
01:27:14,734 --> 01:27:17,821
And we use it
when things get complicated.

1238
01:27:18,947 --> 01:27:20,740
Chubs is in the hospital.

1239
01:27:21,074 --> 01:27:22,242
He's in pretty bad shape,

1240
01:27:22,283 --> 01:27:24,202
so if he has any chance
of making it...

1241
01:27:24,994 --> 01:27:26,121
he'll get it there.

1242
01:27:26,955 --> 01:27:29,290
Don't call him Chubs.
You haven't earned that.

1243
01:27:30,333 --> 01:27:31,501
Charles.

1244
01:27:33,837 --> 01:27:35,964
When he can have visitors,
you'll see him.

1245
01:27:38,466 --> 01:27:40,635
You're wondering
where Liam is.

1246
01:27:41,136 --> 01:27:42,429
You have to let him go.

1247
01:27:42,470 --> 01:27:43,471
I can't do that.

1248
01:27:43,513 --> 01:27:46,099
Liam's not a killer.
You can't make him one.

1249
01:27:46,141 --> 01:27:47,183
We don't create killers.

1250
01:27:47,225 --> 01:27:49,561
I don't know what Liam
told you about the League,

1251
01:27:49,602 --> 01:27:50,812
but that is not
what we're about.

1252
01:27:50,854 --> 01:27:52,397
Then what is the League about?

1253
01:27:52,856 --> 01:27:54,107
Because as far as I can see,

1254
01:27:54,149 --> 01:27:55,442
you're no better
than anyone else.

1255
01:27:55,483 --> 01:27:56,609
We're here to help you...

1256
01:27:57,110 --> 01:27:58,820
and expose the camps
for what they are,

1257
01:27:58,862 --> 01:28:00,488
and stop President Gray.

1258
01:28:00,530 --> 01:28:02,198
President Gray and his son

1259
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:04,075
are collecting us,
just like you are.

1260
01:28:04,117 --> 01:28:05,827
Okay, Cate. Clearly she
doesn't want to be here.

1261
01:28:05,869 --> 01:28:06,953
Rob, I can handle this.

1262
01:28:06,995 --> 01:28:08,830
So, let's make room
for someone useful.

1263
01:28:08,872 --> 01:28:10,206
- Liam is never--
- Look, kid.

1264
01:28:10,623 --> 01:28:11,750
In order to survive

1265
01:28:11,791 --> 01:28:13,501
we all have to do things
that we don't wanna do.

1266
01:28:13,752 --> 01:28:15,462
Your boyfriend can help us.

1267
01:28:15,503 --> 01:28:17,255
I've seen him fling targets
like ragdolls.

1268
01:28:17,297 --> 01:28:18,298
Rob!

1269
01:28:18,340 --> 01:28:19,883
At least with us, he's useful.

1270
01:28:20,717 --> 01:28:22,427
Now, if I have to
turn him into a...

1271
01:28:24,804 --> 01:28:27,682
Liam is not a killer.

1272
01:28:28,391 --> 01:28:30,060
Liam is not a killer.

1273
01:28:30,101 --> 01:28:31,770
And you're an asshole.

1274
01:28:31,811 --> 01:28:33,271
I am an asshole.

1275
01:28:33,313 --> 01:28:34,230
Leave.

1276
01:28:42,197 --> 01:28:43,239
Ruby, stop.

1277
01:28:43,948 --> 01:28:45,408
I am your only friend here.

1278
01:28:45,450 --> 01:28:48,536
And you could help us
do so much good.

1279
01:28:48,578 --> 01:28:51,039
So, please... stop.

1280
01:28:58,838 --> 01:29:00,215
Let Liam go.

1281
01:29:00,256 --> 01:29:01,383
He is a security risk.

1282
01:29:01,424 --> 01:29:03,343
He knows way too much
about us.

1283
01:29:03,385 --> 01:29:04,469
Take me.

1284
01:29:05,095 --> 01:29:06,888
And I'll fight alongside you.

1285
01:29:07,430 --> 01:29:09,182
My one condition...

1286
01:29:09,808 --> 01:29:11,059
is that you let Liam go.

1287
01:29:11,476 --> 01:29:14,562
But if Liam cares for you
as much as you care for him...

1288
01:29:16,523 --> 01:29:17,816
why would he ever leave?

1289
01:29:19,484 --> 01:29:21,194
Let me talk to him.

1290
01:30:00,692 --> 01:30:03,820
Crazy thing is I had...
I had all these plans...

1291
01:30:05,655 --> 01:30:07,615
all these places
I would take you.

1292
01:30:09,534 --> 01:30:11,244
- Liam.
- We'll be okay.

1293
01:30:12,037 --> 01:30:13,747
Just can't let them
separate us.

1294
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,044
I know it sounds cheesy, but...

1295
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:24,466
I'd do it all again
if it meant that I met you.

1296
01:30:26,968 --> 01:30:29,095
- You really think that?
- Yeah.

1297
01:30:32,223 --> 01:30:34,851
I mean, the way I see it,
you and me...

1298
01:30:36,061 --> 01:30:38,271
inevitable.

1299
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:42,192
I'm gonna tell you
a story, okay?

1300
01:30:42,442 --> 01:30:43,443
Okay.

1301
01:30:43,777 --> 01:30:45,862
So, it's summer in Salem,

1302
01:30:45,904 --> 01:30:48,281
and you're suffering through
another boring hot July

1303
01:30:48,323 --> 01:30:50,408
working part-time
at the ice cream parlor.

1304
01:30:51,284 --> 01:30:52,452
Ice cream.

1305
01:30:52,994 --> 01:30:55,330
But one day,
the ice cream parlor

1306
01:30:55,622 --> 01:30:57,040
runs out of ice cream.

1307
01:30:57,957 --> 01:31:00,210
And that happens, you know?

1308
01:31:00,627 --> 01:31:01,878
Your dad says...

1309
01:31:02,420 --> 01:31:04,464
"Hey, let's go
to Virginia Beach."

1310
01:31:05,173 --> 01:31:06,633
Where are you in the story?

1311
01:31:06,675 --> 01:31:07,926
- Me?
- Yeah.

1312
01:31:10,053 --> 01:31:13,515
Well, I'm in--
I'm in Wilmington.

1313
01:31:14,182 --> 01:31:16,810
Suffering through another
boring, hot summer

1314
01:31:16,851 --> 01:31:18,144
working at the garage...

1315
01:31:19,187 --> 01:31:22,023
before heading off
to some fancy university.

1316
01:31:22,816 --> 01:31:25,318
My mom can't bear
to see her baby leave,

1317
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:29,447
so she packs us up for
one last week together at...

1318
01:31:30,156 --> 01:31:31,282
Virginia Beach.

1319
01:31:33,660 --> 01:31:36,037
I see where this is going.

1320
01:31:38,415 --> 01:31:41,042
And then,
as fate would have it...

1321
01:31:41,835 --> 01:31:43,461
on our last day
at the beach...

1322
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:47,382
I spot you.

1323
01:31:49,009 --> 01:31:50,677
I mean, I'm in the middle
of playing volleyball

1324
01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:52,303
with my best friend,
Chubs, but it's...

1325
01:31:53,805 --> 01:31:55,849
It's like everyone else
disappears.

1326
01:31:59,310 --> 01:32:00,895
And you're walking
towards me...

1327
01:32:02,147 --> 01:32:04,357
you have
these big sunglasses on,

1328
01:32:04,774 --> 01:32:07,694
earbuds in and music blaring.

1329
01:32:11,740 --> 01:32:12,991
You're beautiful.

1330
01:32:15,410 --> 01:32:16,870
And you keep smiling
and laughing,

1331
01:32:16,911 --> 01:32:18,663
and looking out
at the water, but...

1332
01:32:23,710 --> 01:32:25,295
all I want to look at is you.

1333
01:32:37,849 --> 01:32:39,059
What happens next?

1334
01:32:42,604 --> 01:32:43,688
Well...

1335
01:32:47,150 --> 01:32:48,860
I tell you that I love you.

1336
01:33:01,581 --> 01:33:02,832
Close your eyes.

1337
01:33:06,378 --> 01:33:08,004
I'm going to finish
this story.

1338
01:34:40,680 --> 01:34:41,556
Who are you?

1339
01:34:42,349 --> 01:34:43,350
The League.

1340
01:34:46,144 --> 01:34:47,937
If you feel well enough,
you can go.

1341
01:34:48,229 --> 01:34:50,023
You're the League
and you're just letting me go?

1342
01:34:50,565 --> 01:34:53,276
Supplies, money, new ID.

1343
01:34:53,318 --> 01:34:54,319
Here you go.

1344
01:34:55,403 --> 01:34:56,946
I don't want anything
from you.

1345
01:35:08,124 --> 01:35:09,584
You're what, 16?

1346
01:35:11,086 --> 01:35:12,921
You should know better
than to work for the League.

1347
01:35:17,175 --> 01:35:18,218
Go.

1348
01:35:18,635 --> 01:35:20,345
Before we change our minds.

1349
01:35:32,982 --> 01:35:33,983
Liam.

1350
01:35:38,655 --> 01:35:39,781
Just be careful.

1351
01:35:42,617 --> 01:35:43,618
You too.

1352
01:36:04,472 --> 01:36:05,598
We're ready for you.

1353
01:36:12,188 --> 01:36:14,524

01:36:20,864 --> 01:36:23,408
<i>But we don't have to stay
in darkness.</i>

1356
01:36:24,451 --> 01:36:27,620
<i>You taught me the only ones
who could help us...</i>

1357
01:36:28,413 --> 01:36:29,706
<i>are us.</i>

1358
01:36:30,832 --> 01:36:31,833
<i>So...</i>

1359
01:36:32,917 --> 01:36:34,711
<i>I have to let you go...</i>

1360
01:36:36,379 --> 01:36:37,714
<i>and step into the light.</i>

1361
01:36:41,176 --> 01:36:43,219
<i>To protect our greatest cause.</i>

1362
01:36:45,764 --> 01:36:46,765
<i>Our family.</i>

1363
01:36:49,351 --> 01:36:50,393
<i>For Zu.</i>

1364
01:36:54,939 --> 01:36:56,107

1365
01:37:00,862 --> 01:37:01,946

1369
01:37:19,589 --> 01:37:21,341

1370
01:37:22,967 --> 01:37:25,261
