1
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,416
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for joining us

2
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,326
for another episode of "Edible Desires".

3
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,186
Before we begin, please welcome

4
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,563
my fabulous co-host, Nikki.

5
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,786
- From the outside looking in

6
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,126
it would seem like Nikki has
everything under control,

7
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:08,066
that life is glamorous, full
of joy, excitement, luxury,

8
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,193
all the things.

9
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,596
And sure, while some of that is true,

10
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,820
there's always more
than what meets the eye.

11
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:17,276
We often only see the surface layer

12
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,650
and that's for good reason.

13
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,856
Most people don't wanna go deeper

14
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,730
out of fear for what they might find.

15
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,136
Whether it's in their minds

16
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,006
or in their physical existence,

17
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,033
humans tend to trap themselves.

18
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,736
Not Nikki, though.

19
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,653
She will find a way to be set free.

20
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:17,926
From the outside looking in,

21
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,143
her life could even
seem like a fairy tale.

22
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,313
But every fairy tale has a villain.

23
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,126
- Her boyfriend
Ethan was a genius,

24
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,126
always working hard on the next big thing.

25
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,946
This time it's something
involving binary sound waves.

26
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:39,780
- Hey, babe.

27
00:03:39,804 --> 00:03:42,263
- Which keeps him
busy enough not to notice.

28
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:46,361
- Mmm.

29
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,866
- One ordinary day,

30
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,593
while out walking her dogs,

31
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,126
she noticed the most
handsomely attired man.

32
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,913
He looked different.

33
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,373
As if he was headed to a
grand event of some sort.

34
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,156
He behaved a bit like a white
rabbit from a fairy tale,

35
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,403
caught in a time warp
as he stared her way.

36
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,180
Sometimes he visits her in her dreams.

37
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,936
Rose has done a lot for Nikki.

38
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,216
But she can't help but feel

39
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,040
like there's more out there for her.

40
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,136
- Who would have thought I would have

41
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,410
to give up these so soon?

42
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,453
I knew you'd be popular.

43
00:05:20,008 --> 00:05:22,330
You are quite different from the others.

44
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,683
Oh, my sweet Nikki.

45
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,720
- Rose.

46
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,413
You protected me.

47
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,424
When I was lost, you took me in.

48
00:05:36,448 --> 00:05:37,848
I'm never gonna forget that.

49
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,563
- Your parents would be so proud.

50
00:05:42,461 --> 00:05:44,011
If only they could see you now.

51
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,916
- She remembered
how one naughty man

52
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,240
played very mean with her.

53
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,777
He gave her nasty medicine

54
00:06:35,801 --> 00:06:39,051
and left her behind like a broken doll.

55
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,893
Maurice still haunts her.

56
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,643
She really believed that he
was a good man deep down.

57
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,750
Will she ever heal from the trauma?

58
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:18,356
- Ladies, I've worked
very hard on this piece.

59
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,680
You've all been paid well.

60
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:21,749
I hope you're prepared.

61
00:07:24,404 --> 00:07:26,403
The premiere's tomorrow.

62
00:07:42,543 --> 00:07:44,117
No, no, no, don't nod.

63
00:07:44,141 --> 00:07:45,299
I sing, you repeat.

64
00:07:45,323 --> 00:07:46,853
I sing, you respond.

65
00:07:46,877 --> 00:07:48,151
Respond.

66
00:07:48,175 --> 00:07:49,874
- No say.

67
00:07:49,898 --> 00:07:50,972
- Si.

68
00:07:50,996 --> 00:07:52,154
I sing, you repeat.

69
00:07:52,178 --> 00:07:54,838
I sing, you respond, respond.

70
00:07:56,224 --> 00:07:57,360
- No say.

71
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,500
- To papa!

72
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:22,630
- Layabout,

73
00:10:44,789 --> 00:10:45,963
- Remember her, Sarah,

74
00:10:45,987 --> 00:10:49,404
this is the female form, a divine nimbus.

75
00:10:56,423 --> 00:10:57,334
- Oh!

76
00:10:57,358 --> 00:10:59,365
- I'm just gonna tickle you!

77
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,440
- How's it coming along?

78
00:12:20,942 --> 00:12:21,942
- It's not good.

79
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,536
I have my presentation
for the grant in two weeks

80
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,243
and I'm shit creek fucked!

81
00:12:30,966 --> 00:12:33,247
Can you hear those damn dogs barking?

82
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,417
It shouldn't be happening.

83
00:12:37,502 --> 00:12:39,653
Not at this frequency level anyway.

84
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,986
- You're gonna figure it out, don't worry.

85
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,503
You're too smart not to.

86
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:49,374
- Wish I could take you with me

87
00:12:49,398 --> 00:12:54,045
to the review board.

88
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:55,819
Yeah, I can get this.

89
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:22,193
- Ethan!

90
00:13:22,217 --> 00:13:23,613
Honey, are these yours?

91
00:14:08,193 --> 00:14:10,193
Wow, what is this place?

92
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:29,750
- Nikki, wake up!

93
00:14:29,774 --> 00:14:30,857
Are you okay?

94
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,203
Wake up, it's me.

95
00:14:34,227 --> 00:14:35,666
It's okay.

96
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:38,273
Hey, come on, come on, breathe.

97
00:14:39,938 --> 00:14:40,747
Come on, it's okay.
- Getting tighter.

98
00:14:40,771 --> 00:14:41,631
- I got you.

99
00:14:41,655 --> 00:14:43,191
I got you.

100
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,215
It's okay.

101
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,480
It's okay, I got you.

102
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,816
- One is told
to stick to the devil

103
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,883
they know best.

104
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,453
But what if one knows multiple demons?

105
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,350
What to do?

106
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:25,060
- Tomorrow, let's go to our favorite spot

107
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,253
for a nice picnic.

108
00:15:29,831 --> 00:15:30,833
You need some rest.

109
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,583
- Why so disappointed?

110
00:16:09,884 --> 00:16:12,033
You know I can't give you them all.

111
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,363
Overhead is high, I'm losing money.

112
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,536
All the hotel rooms for you girls, rent.

113
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,046
Credit cards, security, travel,

114
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,836
dining, car leases, fucking cat food.

115
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,660
The new girls especially don't
have their shit together.

116
00:16:35,419 --> 00:16:36,579
He's calling again, isn't he?

117
00:16:37,604 --> 00:16:39,023
- Who, Maurice?

118
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,526
Unfortunately.

119
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,486
I've changed my number three times.

120
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,803
He just does not quit.

121
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,053
At least he stopped threatening
to barbecue my dogs.

122
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:53,036
- You have that effect on people.

123
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,326
- I make them wanna murder my pets?

124
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:58,363
- No, but you're dangerously enchanting.

125
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,186
I'm shocked that more of your clients

126
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,623
don't take things too far.

127
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,983
Does Ethan know?

128
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,070
- Hell no.

129
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,756
After what happened last time,

130
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,073
Ethan would castrate him.

131
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:17,176
- Maybe that would be for the best.

132
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,626
You have to think of your own safety.

133
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,116
- Maurice is harmless.

134
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,990
Besides, Ethan is so stressed
out with work right now and

135
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,466
the last time those two had an encounter,

136
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:28,466
one was in the ER,

137
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,746
Ethan was in handcuffs.

138
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,820
I have enough drama in my life right now.

139
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,083
- You know what's best, you always do.

140
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:39,206
Just let me know if you'd like me

141
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,856
to speak to Maurice, I
can be very persuasive.

142
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,880
- I will.

143
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,733
- Come on, boy.

144
00:17:51,757 --> 00:17:54,124
Come on, go on, go fetch it.

145
00:17:54,148 --> 00:17:55,231
Go on, go on.

146
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,960
Oh, boo boo.

147
00:18:29,655 --> 00:18:30,671
- Hey.

148
00:18:30,695 --> 00:18:31,695
- Hi.

149
00:18:39,617 --> 00:18:42,217
- The last few months have
been beyond intense, huh?

150
00:18:46,327 --> 00:18:49,116
I don't know how you're not burnt out.

151
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,306
I could barely drag my ass
out of bed this morning.

152
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:53,330
- Trust me.

153
00:18:54,215 --> 00:18:55,415
I share your exhaustion.

154
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,010
But I don't know.

155
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,210
Ethan wants me to go
away with him somewhere.

156
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,716
What's going away somewhere gonna do?

157
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,533
It's not gonna change anything.

158
00:19:08,683 --> 00:19:09,833
- I just wanna be free.

159
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,546
You know, I had this dream last night

160
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:14,683
that I was flying.

161
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,423
And I was hovering above the earth.

162
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,336
And I saw my mom down there

163
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,876
and she was waving and calling to me.

164
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,546
I just wanted to sweep her up

165
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:29,620
and take her with me.

166
00:19:31,272 --> 00:19:33,223
But then, for some reason,

167
00:19:34,187 --> 00:19:36,187
I just, I passed her by.

168
00:19:37,957 --> 00:19:41,560
And then when I looked back, she's gone.

169
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,440
What do you think that means?

170
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,336
- It means you should stop
fucking your therapist

171
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,610
and actually talk to
him about your problems.

172
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,366
- Then I would have to pay him

173
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,990
instead of the other way around.

174
00:19:59,596 --> 00:20:03,686
- A dream
child wandering to a land

175
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:04,853
far and new.

176
00:20:06,691 --> 00:20:09,086
A friendly chat with bird or beast

177
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,913
and hath believe it true.

178
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,400
- What's that from?

179
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,956
- It's this poem.

180
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,080
I had to memorize it for an English class.

181
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,226
You know, it pops in my head

182
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,616
whenever I get really stressed out.

183
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,093
It just relaxes me, makes me feel better.

184
00:20:27,454 --> 00:20:30,113
- You are one strange girl, Nikki.

185
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,806
- The strangest.

186
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:38,811
And that's why you love me.

187
00:22:21,012 --> 00:22:22,012
- Sit.

188
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,357
I told Amy you were an eager one.

189
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:32,073
She has weaseled her way
into your mind, hasn't she?

190
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,013
She's playing us against each other.

191
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:40,076
Just give me two weeks

192
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,873
and this whole town will
be crying out your name.

193
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,740
You'll become a fucking
legend, I promise you.

194
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,373
Ah, you're a stubborn one, aren't you?

195
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,666
Just like your father.

196
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:58,406
- My father?

197
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:00,036
How'd you know him?

198
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,396
- I'm shocked.

199
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,503
You've forgotten?

200
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:06,926
Ah of course, you were very, very young.

201
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,906
Rose took you in

202
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:12,283
and raised you as if you were her own.

203
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,683
Of course, she had her
best interests in mind.

204
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,100
There are things going on here

205
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,493
which are way beyond your control.

206
00:23:27,349 --> 00:23:30,406
There's things you could
never even have imagined

207
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:32,257
in your darkest fantasies.

208
00:23:46,445 --> 00:23:47,778
Watch your back.

209
00:24:26,635 --> 00:24:27,635
- Come.

210
00:24:28,912 --> 00:24:30,523
Come here, come here.

211
00:24:30,547 --> 00:24:32,412
Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick!

212
00:24:32,436 --> 00:24:35,019
Before they see you, come, yes.

213
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:38,458
Yes, yes, come.

214
00:24:39,425 --> 00:24:40,842
Come, come, come.

215
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:43,850
Come inside.

216
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,963
You're safe here.

217
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,423
Yes, yes, yes.

218
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:52,503
You've been through quite the journey.

219
00:24:53,346 --> 00:24:54,980
You look famished.

220
00:24:55,004 --> 00:24:56,200
- Where?

221
00:24:56,224 --> 00:24:57,324
- Here, have some tea.

222
00:24:58,823 --> 00:24:59,866
Yes, yes.

223
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:02,253
All better.

224
00:25:06,391 --> 00:25:07,558
- Who are you?

225
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:09,610
- Who am I?

226
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:11,880
Who are you?

227
00:25:11,904 --> 00:25:13,206
- Oh, enough with this nonsense.

228
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:16,026
I have zero tolerance for games.

229
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,066
- Ready to play?

230
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:18,856
- You're not making any sense.

231
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,146
- Oh, but I am.

232
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:25,170
All sense is nonsense.

233
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,793
Where did you get this?

234
00:25:27,738 --> 00:25:28,988
- I don't know.

235
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,940
- Here.

236
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:33,630
Yes, yes.

237
00:25:35,268 --> 00:25:37,346
Here, here, take this too.

238
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,378
You won't need it.

239
00:25:38,402 --> 00:25:41,420
Until you do, until you do.

240
00:25:41,444 --> 00:25:43,806
- Which way does this thing go?

241
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:44,707
- Any way you like.

242
00:25:44,731 --> 00:25:46,596
Up, down, left, right, in, out.

243
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:50,883
The only difference is it
makes no difference.

244
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:54,260
- I must be dreaming.

245
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:58,386
- But how can you dream
when you're not asleep?

246
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:01,326
- This is batshit mental ward crazy.

247
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,156
How the fuck do I get out of here?

248
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,116
- Where do you wanna go?

249
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,506
- Anywhere.

250
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:07,566
Anywhere but here.

251
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,063
- But which is it?

252
00:26:09,087 --> 00:26:10,423
Anywhere?

253
00:26:10,447 --> 00:26:11,497
Or anywhere but here?

254
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,966
Whatever choice you make is right for you

255
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:16,046
but I must say if you go right

256
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:18,516
there's a mad being there today, yes.

257
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,796
- A mad being?

258
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,826
- Yes.

259
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,496
- Okay then I'll go left.

260
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,526
- No, no, no!

261
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,086
Don't go that way.

262
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,676
That's where she is.

263
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,856
And she's even madder.

264
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:34,453
You see, we're all mad here.

265
00:26:36,969 --> 00:26:39,336
Oh, I have something for you.

266
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,301
Yes, yes, yes.

267
00:26:41,325 --> 00:26:43,389
Yes, yes, yes, here, here.

268
00:26:43,413 --> 00:26:44,223
Here, take it.

269
00:26:44,247 --> 00:26:45,366
Here, yes, yes, yes.

270
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:48,614
Open it, open it, yes.

271
00:26:48,638 --> 00:26:49,638
It's for you.

272
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,313
- An invitation just for you.

273
00:26:53,337 --> 00:26:54,976
- For you, it's for you.

274
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,363
- The queen wants to see what you can do.

275
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,426
Join us for the Red Rose Roy.

276
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,736
- Join us, yes, yes.

277
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,543
- And happily dance the night away.

278
00:27:07,824 --> 00:27:09,886
Look, I'm not really into dancing,

279
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:12,483
and yeah, have fun in your tree.

280
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:14,790
- Travel well.

281
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,496
Bye Nikki!

282
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,520
Bye!

283
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,813
Be safe out there!

284
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,576
Goodbye!

285
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,600
Bye, Nikki.

286
00:27:32,142 --> 00:27:33,796
Come back soon.

287
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,739
- Why were you in the water?

288
00:27:35,763 --> 00:27:36,763
I got you.

289
00:27:37,477 --> 00:27:38,477
I got you.

290
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:48,259
What's happening to you?

291
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,313
Nikki, talk to me.

292
00:28:00,163 --> 00:28:01,163
- What?

293
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:04,830
- You were underwater

294
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,203
I don't know for how
long until I found you.

295
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:14,616
You seem lost, not there.

296
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,103
I'm worried about you, Nikki.

297
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,220
I can't lose you.

298
00:28:19,849 --> 00:28:22,643
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

299
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:23,993
- But I saw you.

300
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:30,180
Still, motionless, almost dead.

301
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:33,223
Your eyes were open but you were gone.

302
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,593
Why were you trying to drown yourself?

303
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
- I wasn't.

304
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:47,283
I'm the happiest I've ever been, okay?

305
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,233
I love my life.

306
00:28:52,257 --> 00:28:53,207
I don't know what happened,

307
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,080
I must have blacked out or something.

308
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:57,623
- You're working too hard.

309
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:01,053
Fuck, we're both working too hard.

310
00:29:02,346 --> 00:29:05,626
Look, soon as I get that grant money,

311
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:07,000
I wanna take you somewhere.

312
00:29:08,564 --> 00:29:09,764
Somewhere special, okay?

313
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,203
Just you and me.

314
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,460
- Sounds good.

315
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:26,613
- You had me worried.

316
00:29:34,863 --> 00:29:36,326
- Nikki closes her eyes

317
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,827
and the memories of the night are erased,

318
00:29:38,851 --> 00:29:41,396
if only for the moment.

319
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:44,626
A new day begins and a
chance for redemption,

320
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:47,350
another chance to prove
something to herself.

321
00:29:52,729 --> 00:29:54,520
- Please, and lock it.

322
00:29:54,544 --> 00:29:55,953
Scene one, take one, mark.

323
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:00,083
Traffic.

324
00:30:01,104 --> 00:30:03,560
- And action.

325
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,846
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for joining us

326
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:16,766
for another episode of Edible Desires.

327
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:18,626
Before we begin, please welcome

328
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:22,163
my fabulous co-host, Nikki.

329
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:26,596
All right, let's get to it, so.

330
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,876
You have some dough here.

331
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,663
Add some nuts to it, right?

332
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:36,316
Again, mix it and mix
it and mix it, right?

333
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:39,823
Now, give me your hand, okay.

334
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:42,310
We're gonna put together okay?

335
00:30:43,189 --> 00:30:44,272
Okay, slowly.

336
00:30:45,448 --> 00:30:47,165
Yeah, that's enough.

337
00:30:47,189 --> 00:30:48,189
- Cut.

338
00:30:49,946 --> 00:30:50,946
And action.

339
00:30:58,927 --> 00:30:59,986
- Cut.

340
00:31:04,178 --> 00:31:05,178
And action.

341
00:31:12,658 --> 00:31:13,658
- Oh, right.

342
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:15,730
See?

343
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,520
Mmm.

344
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:19,960
- Cut.

345
00:31:22,187 --> 00:31:23,730
Yeah, put it back in her mouth again

346
00:31:23,754 --> 00:31:24,754
and take it out again.

347
00:31:26,729 --> 00:31:28,048
- Cut.

348
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:29,967
- Oh of course, to the camera.

349
00:31:29,991 --> 00:31:31,111
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Got it.

350
00:31:32,629 --> 00:31:35,146
Oh, oh, very nice.

351
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,396
See?

352
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,493
Surprise.

353
00:31:39,499 --> 00:31:40,499
Good?

354
00:31:46,035 --> 00:31:49,083
Mmm.

355
00:31:51,672 --> 00:31:53,316
- Cut.

356
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,023
You got it, you got it.

357
00:32:06,619 --> 00:32:07,773
- Where do you want my face?

358
00:32:22,176 --> 00:32:23,593
- Cut.

359
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,963
- Don't listen to Edna.

360
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:54,586
All that sow does is sit
around on her fat ass,

361
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:56,103
eating away at the profits.

362
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,363
This is showbusiness.

363
00:33:01,865 --> 00:33:05,083
But if you want to join
her sideshow, be my guest.

364
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:08,433
- Believe me, I don't.

365
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:10,666
I'm loyal to Rose.

366
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:13,986
- Don't even mention that
manipulative cunt to me.

367
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:16,786
We could have run this town.

368
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:19,596
But she'd rather sit on
her antique high horse

369
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,973
judging people who
aren't stuck in the 50s.

370
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,506
Maybe I'd buy her a rotary phone

371
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:30,376
so she can call for help
when she's going down, pfft.

372
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,086
- Sure, she's old school but

373
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,476
she's always been like a mother to me.

374
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,003
I can't leave her now.

375
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,136
- Don't you see you're
just a payday to her?

376
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,523
But to me, you're a star.

377
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:46,356
Rose doesn't care about
you or anybody else.

378
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,453
She's using you.

379
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,096
Come with me, Nikki,

380
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,270
and the world is yours.

381
00:34:08,562 --> 00:34:10,395
So we have a deal, no?

382
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:18,283
Kay, bring me the FCDA document.

383
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:25,826
- The document, sir.

384
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:56,047
- Welcome aboard.

385
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,780
- How could you?

386
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:58,440
How could you turn on me like this?

387
00:36:00,914 --> 00:36:02,409
- But Rose, I, please-

388
00:36:02,433 --> 00:36:03,536
- No!

389
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,660
I don't wanna hear it.

390
00:36:05,853 --> 00:36:07,193
What's done is done.

391
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,446
I would have expected something like this

392
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,713
from Sarah or Greta.

393
00:36:17,991 --> 00:36:18,991
But you,

394
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,670
I always held you so high.

395
00:36:26,819 --> 00:36:28,057
You're my baby girl.

396
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,256
- Rose, I have to do what's best for me.

397
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,523
- Save your excuses.

398
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:40,493
I know how it is out there.

399
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,580
Whatever!

400
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:45,563
I don't have time for hurt feelings.

401
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,883
Let's have a drink.

402
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,860
For old time's sake.

403
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:59,453
Could you go any more slowly?

404
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,676
Get down, down, down boy!

405
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,173
- Yes, my lady, sorry, sorry.

406
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,978
- That's all, now bark!

407
00:37:10,002 --> 00:37:10,812
Bark!

408
00:37:10,836 --> 00:37:12,027
Bark!

409
00:37:12,051 --> 00:37:13,116
Do you know know how to bark?

410
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,686
Have you not heard a fucking dog?

411
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,519
- Woof, woof!

412
00:37:15,543 --> 00:37:16,353
- Woof?

413
00:37:16,377 --> 00:37:17,694
Woof woof?

414
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:23,167
- Woof, woof, woof!

415
00:37:28,224 --> 00:37:29,719
- Now crawl, get out, get out, get out!

416
00:37:29,743 --> 00:37:33,333
Crawl, crawl, not walk,
crawl, crawl, crawl!

417
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,736
We've had relations.

418
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,760
You know.

419
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,803
To new beginnings.

420
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:58,156
- Rose gave
Nikki her first taste.

421
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,903
She'll never be the same.

422
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,513
- Swallow.

423
00:38:11,537 --> 00:38:13,457
- Silence in court!

424
00:38:13,481 --> 00:38:14,481
Silence!

425
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,686
The court has come to a decision.

426
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:20,906
Nikki, as punishment for her crimes

427
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:23,615
must give eternal servitude to the queen.

428
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:25,896
Any failure to do so

429
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,260
or attempt at escape will result in quick

430
00:38:29,284 --> 00:38:31,123
and painful death.

431
00:38:31,147 --> 00:38:32,047
- No!

432
00:38:32,071 --> 00:38:33,422
You can't do this!

433
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,618
- Court in session, silence!

434
00:38:36,642 --> 00:38:37,846
- Silence!

435
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:40,626
- There is an exception if you so please.

436
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:43,756
If you can complete the queens challenges,

437
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,780
you'll walk free.

438
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,626
But if you fail to do so,

439
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:51,876
you Nikki, will be sent
to eternal quarantine.

440
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,506
What is your decision?

441
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:54,777
- Bring it on!

442
00:38:54,801 --> 00:38:57,051
- Let the challenges begin!

443
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:08,346
Now let's see what you're made of, haha!

444
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:09,370
- 3403N, 118

445
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,053
15W, what city?

446
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:14,357
- Madrid!

447
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,176
- Oh, you call that sportsmanship?

448
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,933
- 4331 12N,

449
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:22,716
122 40W, what city?

450
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,740
- French lick?

451
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,909
- Oh, that's just childs play.

452
00:39:26,933 --> 00:39:29,793
Cut your head off!

453
00:39:31,063 --> 00:39:33,316
- 5033, 23 56E, what city?

454
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,150
- Chicago!

455
00:39:34,174 --> 00:39:35,473
- Two looks hate.

456
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,027
- 4880, what city?

457
00:39:38,051 --> 00:39:39,075
- London.

458
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:42,716
- 832N, 86, what city?

459
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,006
- Los Angeles.

460
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,856
- How can this be?!

461
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,072
- The queenie pie is crying.

462
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:51,846
I thought this was your queendom.

463
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,483
- This magical
green substance is her escape.

464
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,026
It seems to make everything okay

465
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:24,858
at least for the time being.

466
00:41:30,435 --> 00:41:31,435
- Welcome.

467
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:33,906
- We've been expecting you.

468
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:35,636
- Such a pleasure to see you.

469
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,932
- Right this way.

470
00:41:36,956 --> 00:41:37,827
- You honor me.

471
00:41:37,851 --> 00:41:39,066
You honor my family.

472
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:40,076
- Welcome, Nikki.

473
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,659
Fantastic to see you, come have a drink.

474
00:41:42,683 --> 00:41:43,683
- Ah!

475
00:41:44,355 --> 00:41:45,830
There you are.

476
00:41:45,854 --> 00:41:47,483
I thought you'd never come.

477
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:53,896
Didn't anyone tell you
this was a mad party?

478
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,136
A party of epic proportions

479
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,306
and tea party!

480
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:02,196
- Hey oh, wasn't my fault that I was late,

481
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,776
I tried to be here on time.

482
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,566
But it's not my fault, it's not my fault.

483
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:07,516
Everything was set,
everything was planned.

484
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:10,696
There was this thing,
this thing in the road.

485
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,836
And a tree, there was a tree and a thing.

486
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:16,487
There was a thing and a tree and a lady!

487
00:42:20,252 --> 00:42:21,946
This old lady was in the way,

488
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:23,812
I couldn't get around her, I tried.

489
00:42:23,836 --> 00:42:24,770
I really tried, I tried to get around her

490
00:42:24,794 --> 00:42:26,443
but no no, she was in the way.

491
00:42:26,467 --> 00:42:29,587
But I had everything set today, set, set!

492
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:33,849
I was late, oh,

493
00:42:45,083 --> 00:42:46,144
I'm late!

494
00:42:48,077 --> 00:42:49,909
- I love tea parties.

495
00:42:49,933 --> 00:42:51,563
Hooray!

496
00:42:51,587 --> 00:42:52,616
Woo, woo!

497
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,236
Now we can begin.

498
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:58,610
Ladies, gents, let the show begin, woo!

499
00:43:11,712 --> 00:43:15,688
- Are you okay, honey?

500
00:43:15,712 --> 00:43:16,712
- Yeah.

501
00:43:17,997 --> 00:43:18,997
I'm fine.

502
00:43:19,879 --> 00:43:21,296
Go back to sleep.

503
00:45:01,128 --> 00:45:03,956
- The dreams
are getting more intense.

504
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:05,880
It's hard to tell what's real anymore.

505
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,466
Will she decide to stay
in this fantasy realm

506
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:11,343
or will she face her true reality?

507
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:14,946
Behind the glitz and glam

508
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:16,783
there's a darkness that follows her.

509
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:19,360
A world where she's a prisoner

510
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:21,963
stuck inside her own mind.

511
00:45:24,173 --> 00:45:26,742
- A toast to my darling Nikki!

512
00:45:29,217 --> 00:45:32,676
- Detached from true
feelings of love and peace.

513
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:33,700
Where will she go?

514
00:45:54,723 --> 00:45:57,056
- Well what do we have here?

515
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:00,963
You guys started without me.

516
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:14,780
- My name's Maurice.

517
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:18,080
Thanks for coming tonight.

518
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:34,766
Yeah, this is Greta.

519
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:36,190
We used to perform together.

520
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:39,106
- You're new here, aren't you?

521
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,846
- I think so.

522
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:42,376
I'm not sure.

523
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,176
- You must be.

524
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,693
I'd never forget a face like yours.

525
00:46:55,176 --> 00:46:58,406
- I think I've seen you someplace before.

526
00:46:58,430 --> 00:47:00,636
- Of course you have, darling.

527
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,563
I'm quite famous.

528
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:10,403
- Let the show begin.

529
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:19,933
- Is this my sweet prince come to save me?

530
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:32,800
Ooh.

531
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,520
So strong.

532
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,736
- Maurice is here.

533
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,663
And somehow he seems different.

534
00:48:00,141 --> 00:48:01,776
- Ooh.

535
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:02,800
He likes you.

536
00:48:03,581 --> 00:48:04,581
Wow, oh, oh.

537
00:48:56,995 --> 00:48:58,162
- I loved you.

538
00:49:13,771 --> 00:49:16,206
- But now I'm gonna hurt you!

539
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,998
- Wha, wait a minute.

540
00:50:46,022 --> 00:50:47,355
That's it, okay.

541
00:50:48,582 --> 00:50:49,582
45, 76, one.

542
00:51:04,299 --> 00:51:05,299
And 110!

543
00:51:07,958 --> 00:51:09,809
That's it!

544
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:11,151
That's it, I did it!

545
00:51:11,175 --> 00:51:12,515
I did it!

546
00:51:12,539 --> 00:51:13,539
Yes! Yes!

547
00:51:15,019 --> 00:51:18,334
Oh god, I can't believe it!

548
00:51:18,358 --> 00:51:19,358
Woo, woo!

549
00:51:21,006 --> 00:51:26,006
I did it, I did it!

550
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,267
Yes, woo, woo!

551
00:51:35,107 --> 00:51:40,107
Haha, woo!

552
00:51:48,262 --> 00:51:49,262
Yes!

553
00:52:10,467 --> 00:52:12,462
You first, then you!

554
00:52:12,486 --> 00:52:15,385
And you mister, I want
to hear you all together!

555
00:52:15,409 --> 00:52:16,409
One, two!

556
00:52:25,766 --> 00:52:29,877
Yes! Hahaha!

557
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:48,361
Ah!

558
00:52:48,385 --> 00:52:50,135
I can't believe this.

559
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,173
- Are you okay?

560
00:53:05,486 --> 00:53:06,956
Good.

561
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,456
'Cause you're on in five.

562
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,736
- Nikki knew in her heart

563
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,583
something was off with Greta.

564
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:15,076
But she just trusted.

565
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:17,133
They were friends no matter what.

566
00:53:30,982 --> 00:53:32,016
- Bravo!

567
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,896
- Why is he here?

568
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,215
He would never be invited to such a party.

569
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:37,239
- Bravo!

570
00:53:38,287 --> 00:53:39,287
Bravo!

571
00:54:01,066 --> 00:54:04,758
- Chap, chap,
chap, chap, chap, chap,

572
00:54:04,782 --> 00:54:08,125
chap, chap, chap, chap, chap, chap, chap,

573
00:54:08,149 --> 00:54:11,537
chap, chap, chap, chap, chap, chap, chap,

574
00:54:11,561 --> 00:54:15,256
chap, chap, chap, chap, chap, chap, chap!

575
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:40,060
- Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

576
00:55:41,439 --> 00:55:43,726
Oh, look at this.

577
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:47,135
Have a fish, really good fish.

578
00:55:47,159 --> 00:55:48,713
Try, try, try, try.

579
00:55:48,737 --> 00:55:50,820
Yes, kissy, kissy, kissy.

580
00:55:54,663 --> 00:55:55,746
Need some spices.

581
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:57,083
Hold on a second, hold.

582
00:55:57,952 --> 00:55:58,952
Okay.

583
00:56:08,835 --> 00:56:10,207
Wait, wait wait.

584
00:56:10,231 --> 00:56:12,648
Last one, last one, last one.

585
00:56:21,749 --> 00:56:23,519
I can live with that.

586
00:56:23,543 --> 00:56:24,353
All right.

587
00:56:24,377 --> 00:56:25,890
- Taste this!

588
00:56:25,914 --> 00:56:27,914
You sick, maniacal fuck!

589
00:56:41,894 --> 00:56:42,894
Bastard!

590
00:57:02,153 --> 00:57:03,038
You sick fuck.

591
00:57:03,062 --> 00:57:06,036
You maniacal motherfucker.

592
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:07,060
You bastard!

593
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,813
- Get your hands off him!

594
00:57:15,718 --> 00:57:18,551
Who the fuck do you think you are?

595
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:21,396
You think you can just come into our world

596
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:23,796
and destroy everything that
Kemper and I have built?

597
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:26,266
- You ungrateful harlot.

598
00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:28,623
Did you forget about
the contract you signed?

599
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,943
You're mine now, forever!

600
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:34,533
To do with as I please!

601
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:52,993
You'll soon learn your place.

602
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:55,946
- How could you do this to us?

603
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:58,496
To me after everything
that we've been through!

604
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:01,106
- I don't know you and I
don't wanna fucking know you.

605
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:03,166
You stay the fuck away from me!

606
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:05,233
- You've left me no choice.

607
00:58:16,752 --> 00:58:18,441
You shouldn't have done that.

608
00:58:18,465 --> 00:58:20,216
- Nikki, darling.

609
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:23,041
It's a shame we could not work things out.

610
00:58:23,065 --> 00:58:25,106
You had so much potential.

611
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:28,156
- You've ruined everything.

612
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:30,583
This was our shot at the big time.

613
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:36,069
- Finish her!

614
00:58:36,093 --> 00:58:37,093
- No!

615
00:58:46,575 --> 00:58:47,658
I'm so sorry.

616
00:58:49,043 --> 00:58:50,743
I feared this was going to happen.

617
00:58:52,106 --> 00:58:53,856
I should have never left your side.

618
00:58:57,370 --> 00:58:58,370
What should we do?

619
00:59:00,930 --> 00:59:05,333
- Let's teach that
self-righteous prick a lesson!

620
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:14,906
Sweet dreams, asshole.

621
00:59:14,930 --> 00:59:17,023
- Nikki
started at the beginning.

622
00:59:17,870 --> 00:59:20,540
She's reached the end and
now she's ready to stop.

623
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,963
No longer stuck in her mind.

624
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:51,483
Her body no longer merely a toy.

625
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:56,723
The power is hers, free.

626
