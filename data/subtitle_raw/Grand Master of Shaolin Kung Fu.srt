1
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,700
What's that you say?

2
00:03:08,767 --> 00:03:10,533
Master's been killed?

3
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,700
Yes.

4
00:03:11,767 --> 00:03:13,867
He was attacked by a stranger
in the night.

5
00:03:13,933 --> 00:03:16,367
It was awful.

6
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:21,600
Let's go.

7
00:04:29,267 --> 00:04:30,367
Hey...

8
00:04:30,433 --> 00:04:31,800
Ugh!

9
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,233
Hiyah!

10
00:04:43,433 --> 00:04:44,533
Ugh!

11
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,867
Ooh!

12
00:04:45,933 --> 00:04:48,200
Hoo... huh!

13
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,067
Hoo-ahh!

14
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:32,600
Hoo-ahh!

15
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:42,467
You feel no repentance
in your challenging us.

16
00:05:43,933 --> 00:05:45,067
All right.

17
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,700
You think my leg Kung Fu
is nothing.

18
00:05:47,767 --> 00:05:50,867
You now destroy
my panther fist.

19
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:51,967
Huh.

20
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:53,233
Tell me what'll be next.

21
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,533
I know only
your panther fist

22
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,733
Can do evil killing
such as I have seen.

23
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,700
From now on,

24
00:06:01,767 --> 00:06:04,467
I will be the most feared
of all warriors.

25
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:17,633
Hiyah!

26
00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:44,067
Hiyah!

27
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,300
Oh!

28
00:06:50,767 --> 00:06:53,133
Ugh!

29
00:07:10,767 --> 00:07:13,067
I have lost,

30
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,667
But you still
won't be the leader.

31
00:07:17,133 --> 00:07:18,867
The Shaolin Temple

32
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:21,367
Has be destroyed
by you already.

33
00:07:21,433 --> 00:07:23,367
Now who will support you?

34
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:26,200
The Shaolin Temple will...

35
00:07:29,433 --> 00:07:30,800
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

36
00:07:32,267 --> 00:07:33,433
Hmm.

37
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,067
Hiyah!

38
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,333
Dragon?

39
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,433
Dragon Lin?

40
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
The Grand Abbot.

41
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:55,667
He's been found dead.

42
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:57,067
He's been murdered.

43
00:07:57,067 --> 00:07:59,133
Found murdered?

44
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,333
Come on!

45
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,667
But wait!

46
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:03,833
The murderer fled
and left no trace behind.

47
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,767
We can't avenge him.

48
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:08,800
Hmm.

49
00:08:45,933 --> 00:08:47,533
Master Ma,

50
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,833
You know I've done
nothing wrong.

51
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,867
You exploited
your reputation.

52
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:54,600
You've raped
another man's woman.

53
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:57,100
How can you say
that you're not guilty?

54
00:08:57,167 --> 00:08:58,833
It's not true.

55
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,733
I obeyed your orders.

56
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,633
Now you accuse me of all these
ridiculous crimes!

57
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,633
Heck.

58
00:09:06,433 --> 00:09:08,200
Just give half
of your wealth

59
00:09:08,267 --> 00:09:09,367
To our master.

60
00:09:09,433 --> 00:09:11,533
Then everything
will be all right.

61
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,200
It's no good to you, huh?

62
00:09:13,267 --> 00:09:14,533
You know I'm right,
huh?

63
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,700
Huh?

64
00:09:15,767 --> 00:09:17,067
Damn you!

65
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,067
What's that?

66
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,200
And the same goes
for all of you bastards!

67
00:09:21,267 --> 00:09:22,500
You scum!

68
00:09:26,267 --> 00:09:28,533
You can still decide
whether life or wealth

69
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,067
Is more important.

70
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,200
Now, woman,

71
00:09:31,267 --> 00:09:32,633
Did that dog rape you?

72
00:09:34,267 --> 00:09:35,367
Speak, I said!

73
00:09:35,433 --> 00:09:36,533
Huh!

74
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,633
Speak!

75
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:47,867
Please.

76
00:09:47,933 --> 00:09:49,367
Please tell him the truth.

77
00:09:49,433 --> 00:09:50,633
Tell him it wasn't me.

78
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,867
You're guilty.

79
00:09:53,933 --> 00:09:56,700
You can't deny it now.

80
00:09:56,767 --> 00:09:58,333
You're guilty,
you flea ridden dog!

81
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,100
You're lying!

82
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:02,200
I'm no rapist!

83
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:04,200
She cries out of fear!

84
00:10:04,267 --> 00:10:05,867
Fear of you!

85
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:07,800
You are the one
that keeps raping her!

86
00:10:15,267 --> 00:10:16,633
Why not admit it?

87
00:10:18,933 --> 00:10:20,700
I'll never admit it!

88
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:22,200
You're the rapist!

89
00:10:31,433 --> 00:10:32,433
Stop it!

90
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,567
Huh?

91
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,333
What did you just say?

92
00:10:44,933 --> 00:10:47,867
We're all powers
of the Buddha.

93
00:10:47,933 --> 00:10:49,200
Why the whips?

94
00:10:49,267 --> 00:10:52,000
Can you show no mercy
towards your prisoner?

95
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,467
You crazy monk.

96
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,700
I look for
our Abbots murderer.

97
00:11:10,767 --> 00:11:12,067
Hmm.

98
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,267
Well, in that case then...

99
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:29,533
You should
mind your own business.

100
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,067
Huh.

101
00:12:59,067 --> 00:13:01,200
Ugh!

102
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,133
Hi...

103
00:13:39,933 --> 00:13:41,367
Yah!

104
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,133
Ugh!

105
00:15:38,767 --> 00:15:40,067
Uh, what's the matter,

106
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,367
You don't think I clean
the teapot there or something?

107
00:15:42,433 --> 00:15:44,700
Everything's unclean
in this world.

108
00:15:44,767 --> 00:15:47,067
Leave it for one instant
and it all is soiled.

109
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,167
Everything.

110
00:15:48,233 --> 00:15:50,667
What the heck are you
talking about there, huh?

111
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:51,933
There you are.

112
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,367
If I were to take your heart
and filter it through here

113
00:15:56,433 --> 00:15:57,867
I'd find
there were dirt in it, too.

114
00:15:57,933 --> 00:15:59,867
Why are you gonna
filter my heart through there?

115
00:16:00,067 --> 00:16:01,100
You tell me that one.

116
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:02,433
I don't
understand this.

117
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,933
Think about it.
Hey, come back.

118
00:16:05,067 --> 00:16:06,200
Huh?

119
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,200
Huh?

120
00:16:20,267 --> 00:16:22,200
Oh, come in, please.

121
00:16:22,267 --> 00:16:23,367
Please you're welcome.

122
00:16:23,433 --> 00:16:24,700
Please come right this way.

123
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:25,800
Right this way.

124
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,067
I'd like a room
for a few days.

125
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,700
Oh, yes,
certainly, yes.

126
00:16:30,767 --> 00:16:32,967
One second and I'll go
find one for you right here.

127
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,633
Please register, huh?
Hmm.

128
00:16:55,767 --> 00:16:56,867
Huh?

129
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:58,200
Uh, so it's you.

130
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,533
Great Master
of Shaolin Temple.

131
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,433
I'm so honored
by your presence.

132
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,600
Right this way.

133
00:17:06,267 --> 00:17:08,200
I'd like to stay
for four or five days.

134
00:17:08,267 --> 00:17:10,367
Since the robbers are gone
our town is so peaceful.

135
00:17:10,433 --> 00:17:11,700
We're so happy now.

136
00:17:11,767 --> 00:17:12,967
Ha, ha.

137
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:14,300
Were they really
as disruptive as that?

138
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,600
Oh, curse the memory.

139
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:18,433
We were defenseless against them
like little goats, uh...

140
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,800
Before a tiger.

141
00:17:21,267 --> 00:17:22,367
What do you mean?

142
00:17:22,433 --> 00:17:23,533
Go on.

143
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,533
They abuse the name
of fighters guild to prey upon

144
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,700
The village folk.

145
00:17:26,767 --> 00:17:28,533
In three years,
they never paid a single bill.

146
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,867
Oh, I felt much stress.

147
00:17:29,933 --> 00:17:31,200
I couldn't sleep,
you know.

148
00:17:31,267 --> 00:17:32,367
My stomach went bad.

149
00:17:32,433 --> 00:17:33,700
I even went bald, too.

150
00:17:33,767 --> 00:17:35,067
Well, don't worry.

151
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,367
I'll keep 'em away.

152
00:17:36,433 --> 00:17:38,067
I heard that you went forth
and took revenge for the Abbot

153
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,533
And now you work
for the common folk.

154
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,233
You know, you can really...
Hey, I'm sort of hungry.

155
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,567
You got anything to eat?

156
00:17:42,633 --> 00:17:44,067
Oh, right away,
back in a flash.

157
00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:45,400
Ha, ha, right back.

158
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,233
Put the heavenly spice
under the eaves.

159
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,533
Even from ten miles away

160
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,467
He'll be lured
by its fragrance.

161
00:19:05,267 --> 00:19:06,867
Hey, you!

162
00:19:06,933 --> 00:19:08,800
Hey, you!

163
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,533
I haven't caused you
any trouble, have I?

164
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,733
What's inside your bag?

165
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,900
No!

166
00:19:16,967 --> 00:19:18,733
You can't touch that.

167
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,900
Quick.

168
00:19:19,967 --> 00:19:21,167
Get him!

169
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,367
I told you.

170
00:19:35,433 --> 00:19:36,700
It's none of your business.

171
00:19:36,767 --> 00:19:38,333
Now you've opened up my box
and let my pet out.

172
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,833
You stupid idiot,
lousy twit.

173
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,167
Get him!

174
00:19:41,233 --> 00:19:42,767
Yes, boss.

175
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,733
Ugh!

176
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,800
Hmm.

177
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,200
Who are you anyway?

178
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:26,700
I'm a descendent

179
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,967
Of the great Dragon himself.

180
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:26,200
Ugh!

181
00:21:31,767 --> 00:21:33,067
From here on after,

182
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,867
Don't give me anymore trouble.

183
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,533
I gave you a last chance

184
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,700
Whether you choose Shaolin
or play safe with us.

185
00:22:06,767 --> 00:22:08,400
What is your decision?

186
00:22:08,467 --> 00:22:10,400
I have only one word.

187
00:22:10,467 --> 00:22:11,900
That word is "No."

188
00:22:11,967 --> 00:22:13,700
I refuse to have
anything to do with you.

189
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,733
You should think
in terms of survival.

190
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,067
I'm not afraid of death.

191
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,367
You were the one

192
00:22:22,433 --> 00:22:24,067
Who killed the Abbot.

193
00:22:49,967 --> 00:22:51,100
Ugh!

194
00:22:51,167 --> 00:22:52,933
Come on, try something new.

195
00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:54,267
Cut off my head.

196
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:55,433
I need...

197
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,433
I need one of you guys
to try it.

198
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,500
Just one will get $10
if he can cut off my head.

199
00:23:00,567 --> 00:23:02,133
It's very easy.

200
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,467
Come on,
you must be able to do it.

201
00:23:03,533 --> 00:23:04,800
Come on, you guys.

202
00:23:04,867 --> 00:23:06,800
You're all suckers
if you're not gonna come.

203
00:23:06,867 --> 00:23:08,467
Come on,
just one!

204
00:23:08,533 --> 00:23:10,567
Okay, I'll do it!

205
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,333
Hey,

206
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,667
That's not fair.

207
00:23:17,733 --> 00:23:19,167
I'll show you how.

208
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:20,500
Now, listen carefully.

209
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:21,833
Listen, all of you.

210
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,833
I don't want anybody
breaking any rules.

211
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,200
This is my head

212
00:23:25,267 --> 00:23:26,833
That's gonna go
through those holes there.

213
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,333
Now, when I poke it through,

214
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,067
You gotta try and cut it
with that sword, all right?

215
00:23:31,067 --> 00:23:32,100
Hmm.

216
00:23:42,267 --> 00:23:43,533
Ooh!

217
00:23:46,933 --> 00:23:49,367
Ah, hard luck.

218
00:23:49,433 --> 00:23:51,067
Come on,
the next one will be luckier.

219
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,067
$10 for anybody
who can do it.

220
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,200
$10.

221
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:55,533
What's $10 to you guys?

222
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,333
Come on,
don't just stand there.

223
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,133
Can I play your game?

224
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,200
Hey, a man can gamble,
can he?

225
00:24:05,267 --> 00:24:06,700
That's right.

226
00:24:06,767 --> 00:24:08,367
But with a trick so cunning,

227
00:24:08,433 --> 00:24:10,067
I simply can't resist.

228
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,700
Now, can I play or not?

229
00:24:12,767 --> 00:24:15,200
Here's my money.

230
00:24:15,267 --> 00:24:16,533
But I'm warning you,

231
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,867
I'm pretty good.

232
00:24:17,933 --> 00:24:19,200
All right.

233
00:24:19,267 --> 00:24:21,533
But, hey, let's make
the stakes even higher.

234
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,533
I tell you what,

235
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,367
I'm gonna bet all my takings
from today on this.

236
00:24:26,433 --> 00:24:28,367
You son of a gun.

237
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:31,100
That's exactly
how I'd want to play the game.

238
00:24:31,167 --> 00:24:32,433
Hey.

239
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,600
I really appreciate
your zeal.

240
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:36,433
Right, just to get
things straight,

241
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,700
Let's do it.

242
00:24:39,767 --> 00:24:41,367
Here, all my earnings
from today

243
00:24:41,433 --> 00:24:42,867
Just in case

244
00:24:42,933 --> 00:24:44,533
I'm gonna lose my head.

245
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,800
But I won't.

246
00:24:54,267 --> 00:24:55,533
He-he-he.

247
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,367
Don't get nervous.

248
00:24:57,433 --> 00:24:58,467
Hmm.

249
00:25:05,767 --> 00:25:07,067
Hmm.

250
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,600
Hmm.

251
00:25:19,767 --> 00:25:21,367
Cheating the people
out of their money

252
00:25:21,433 --> 00:25:22,867
Is a great sin.

253
00:25:22,933 --> 00:25:24,533
I'll punish you
for this crime of yours.

254
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,867
I promise you.

255
00:25:25,933 --> 00:25:27,100
Nevermore.

256
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:28,433
You're forgiven.

257
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,933
But I'll take my earnings.

258
00:25:30,067 --> 00:25:31,267
Any objections?

259
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:32,867
No objection.

260
00:25:36,267 --> 00:25:37,467
Huh?

261
00:25:38,933 --> 00:25:40,200
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

262
00:25:47,933 --> 00:25:49,533
Put it right here.

263
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,867
Here you go, miss.

264
00:25:50,933 --> 00:25:52,200
All cut up for you.

265
00:25:52,267 --> 00:25:53,333
Here.

266
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,700
Please take 'em.
They're yours.

267
00:25:54,767 --> 00:25:55,967
Go on.

268
00:25:57,433 --> 00:25:59,067
Oh, no thank you.

269
00:25:59,067 --> 00:26:00,233
Oh, miss.

270
00:26:02,933 --> 00:26:04,067
Oh-ho!

271
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,867
Oh, I am terribly sorry, sir.

272
00:26:05,933 --> 00:26:07,467
That's all right.

273
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:09,733
May Buddha bless you.

274
00:26:34,633 --> 00:26:36,233
Hey Gus, hurry!

275
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,567
It's coming.

276
00:26:37,633 --> 00:26:39,400
It's coming.

277
00:26:39,467 --> 00:26:40,567
Ooh, whoa!

278
00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:42,333
Whoa-oh-ho!

279
00:26:47,433 --> 00:26:49,700
You fool!
A thousand pardons.

280
00:26:49,767 --> 00:26:51,333
Oh!

281
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,567
I'll teach you!

282
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:57,433
Oh!

283
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,767
Did that hurt?

284
00:26:58,833 --> 00:26:59,833
Oh, sorry.

285
00:27:01,433 --> 00:27:03,067
Oh!

286
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,700
Oh-ho!

287
00:27:04,767 --> 00:27:06,367
What's...?

288
00:27:06,433 --> 00:27:08,367
What's your problem?

289
00:27:08,433 --> 00:27:10,200
You're my problem.

290
00:27:10,267 --> 00:27:12,067
Hey, you.
Uh-huh?

291
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,533
Hey, you can't
walk away like that.

292
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,867
First, you trip me up
and hurt me.

293
00:27:16,933 --> 00:27:18,167
What's wrong with you?

294
00:27:18,233 --> 00:27:19,667
Don't you think
you should quit

295
00:27:19,733 --> 00:27:21,533
Before you really get hurt?

296
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,767
For all I know,
you've separated my vertebrae.

297
00:27:23,833 --> 00:27:25,167
I will.

298
00:28:30,833 --> 00:28:31,800
Huh?

299
00:28:31,867 --> 00:28:32,800
Huh?

300
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,867
Oh, I'm so terribly sorry.

301
00:28:37,933 --> 00:28:39,133
Please forgive us...

302
00:28:40,867 --> 00:28:42,133
No!

303
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,633
No, no, what're you...

304
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,633
No, no, no!

305
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,200
No.

306
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,467
Uh, no.

307
00:29:02,433 --> 00:29:03,867
You lousy no good.

308
00:29:03,933 --> 00:29:05,533
You have the nerve
to show up here right now?

309
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,867
Sorry, boss.

310
00:29:06,933 --> 00:29:08,367
I... I'll work harder
and much faster.

311
00:29:08,433 --> 00:29:09,700
Harder and faster?

312
00:29:09,767 --> 00:29:11,867
You better give me
compensation right now

313
00:29:11,933 --> 00:29:13,200
Or I'm throwing you
clear out of here.

314
00:29:13,267 --> 00:29:14,533
You got that?

315
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,867
Now wait a minute.

316
00:29:15,933 --> 00:29:17,533
I promise I'll work
much harder.

317
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,200
Get out of here right now
or else...

318
00:29:19,267 --> 00:29:21,133
Or else I'm gonna kill you!
Oh, oh... okay!

319
00:29:22,433 --> 00:29:23,700
Okay, okay!

320
00:29:23,767 --> 00:29:25,400
Now you don't
have to harm anybody.

321
00:29:25,467 --> 00:29:26,900
Be careful with that thing.

322
00:29:33,267 --> 00:29:34,467
I'm homeless.

323
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,467
Just like an orphan.

324
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,067
Excuse me.

325
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,700
Excuse me.
Huh?

326
00:29:48,767 --> 00:29:49,867
Go away.

327
00:29:49,933 --> 00:29:51,133
I've got no money
for beggars.

328
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,633
I've lost
all my business today.

329
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,967
Go on.

330
00:29:54,067 --> 00:29:56,300
But, sir,
I'm not here for money.

331
00:29:56,367 --> 00:29:58,800
Won't you please
listen to me?

332
00:29:58,867 --> 00:30:00,967
Huh, you're here as a guest?

333
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:02,533
All right.

334
00:30:03,933 --> 00:30:04,933
Right this way.

335
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,267
Right this way.

336
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:08,267
We got fried rice,
boiled shrimp, salt pork buns...

337
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:09,567
You name it,
we got it.

338
00:30:09,633 --> 00:30:10,900
No, listen to me.
Huh?

339
00:30:10,967 --> 00:30:12,067
What do you want then?

340
00:30:12,133 --> 00:30:13,200
Tell me.

341
00:30:13,267 --> 00:30:14,533
Please forgive me.

342
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,633
I'd like to ask you something.

343
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,967
Huh?

344
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:19,733
Wha... what does that mean?

345
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,133
I have a favor to ask
of you.

346
00:30:23,433 --> 00:30:24,567
Huh?

347
00:30:24,633 --> 00:30:26,200
Uh, all right,
but talk fast.

348
00:30:26,267 --> 00:30:27,700
And what is this favor,
huh?

349
00:30:27,767 --> 00:30:29,700
I heard that the Master
of Shaolin Temple

350
00:30:29,767 --> 00:30:31,033
Is staying here.

351
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,033
You're looking for him?
Mm-hm.

352
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,533
Ah-ha-ha-ha.

353
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,367
Mm-hmm.

354
00:30:36,433 --> 00:30:37,633
Mm-hmm.

355
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,367
He's staying here all right,
but with you dressed like that

356
00:30:41,433 --> 00:30:43,367
I don't know whether
he'd really want to see you.

357
00:30:43,433 --> 00:30:45,533
It's something
of an emergency.

358
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,533
I really do
have to see him.

359
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,700
You can't see him
looking like that.

360
00:30:49,767 --> 00:30:51,200
You go stand in the corner
and I'll call him down here.

361
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:53,433
Okay?
Oh, thank you, sir.

362
00:30:56,267 --> 00:30:58,700
Some people say evil of you
in this town.

363
00:30:58,767 --> 00:31:00,867
So I've come
to give you a blessing.

364
00:31:00,933 --> 00:31:02,100
Buddha bless you.

365
00:31:02,167 --> 00:31:03,867
They all lie.

366
00:31:03,933 --> 00:31:05,867
The gang of Wu Dong
has done this.

367
00:31:05,933 --> 00:31:07,367
They want us to join them.

368
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:10,067
They've destroyed property
and they blame it all on us.

369
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,367
The people misunderstand.

370
00:31:12,433 --> 00:31:14,367
Before you blame others,

371
00:31:14,433 --> 00:31:17,067
You should look at
your own self first.

372
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,200
Are you also here
for trouble then?

373
00:31:19,267 --> 00:31:20,533
Is that is, huh?

374
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,067
How can you say that?

375
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,700
I am here
to look for the killer

376
00:31:23,767 --> 00:31:25,067
Of the Shaolin Abbot.

377
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,700
That is my soul mission.

378
00:31:26,767 --> 00:31:28,067
Mind your own business.

379
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,633
Please leave us alone.

380
00:31:30,933 --> 00:31:32,533
And what if I don't go?

381
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,067
Then what'll you do?

382
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,533
I can do nothing
but fight you off.

383
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,867
That's my only defense.

384
00:31:36,933 --> 00:31:38,133
Hiyah!

385
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,333
Ugh!

386
00:32:02,067 --> 00:32:03,633
Have I really got

387
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,300
No place in this world
to go to?

388
00:32:09,067 --> 00:32:10,800
Must I beg for food?

389
00:32:20,933 --> 00:32:22,767
I've heard your Kung Fu's
pretty good.

390
00:32:22,833 --> 00:32:24,433
Who me?

391
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,900
What're you talking about?

392
00:32:25,967 --> 00:32:28,700
Come on, don't be
such a coward.

393
00:32:28,767 --> 00:32:30,067
Now, you listen.

394
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,867
I don't fight with anyone.

395
00:32:31,933 --> 00:32:33,133
But we do.

396
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:06,733
Ugh!

397
00:33:49,067 --> 00:33:50,600
Ugh!

398
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:12,900
Ah, so, then our
master is back.

399
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,733
Anyone ask for me
while I was gone?

400
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,733
Uh, as a matter of fact, yes.

401
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,467
She's right this way.

402
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:22,467
Uh... What?

403
00:34:23,933 --> 00:34:25,367
How can she disappear
like that?

404
00:34:25,433 --> 00:34:26,867
Who was it?
Your caller,

405
00:34:26,933 --> 00:34:28,200
A very pretty girl,
oh, yes.

406
00:34:28,267 --> 00:34:29,433
Not so.

407
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,600
A girl?

408
00:34:30,667 --> 00:34:31,933
Should have been a man.
Oh, yes.

409
00:34:32,067 --> 00:34:33,267
She wanted to see you,
really.

410
00:34:33,333 --> 00:34:34,767
I just can't figure out
where's she's gone now.

411
00:34:34,833 --> 00:34:36,067
Ha, ha.

412
00:34:36,067 --> 00:34:38,500
If anyone else comes for me,
send 'em up to my room.

413
00:34:38,567 --> 00:34:39,600
Yes, yes,
of course.

414
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:40,833
Of course.

415
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,500
Where could she have gone?

416
00:34:42,567 --> 00:34:43,767
Hmm.

417
00:34:45,267 --> 00:34:46,533
What a coincidence.

418
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,133
I thought for sure
it was him.

419
00:34:56,933 --> 00:34:59,367
Many fighters of Shaolin
have surrendered.

420
00:34:59,433 --> 00:35:00,933
Why are you so stubborn?

421
00:35:01,067 --> 00:35:02,433
Why do you resist like this?

422
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,100
Tell me, huh?

423
00:35:04,167 --> 00:35:05,867
Why?

424
00:35:05,933 --> 00:35:07,533
Because the spirit of Shaolin

425
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,867
Is totally different
to your Moja.

426
00:35:09,933 --> 00:35:12,367
It's only one
of self interest, you dog.

427
00:35:13,767 --> 00:35:15,533
Don't you know
that all has changed now?

428
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,200
The strong destroy the meek.

429
00:35:17,267 --> 00:35:18,867
You had best
change your school

430
00:35:18,933 --> 00:35:20,533
To the name
of Wu Dong or else

431
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,200
You will face disaster.

432
00:35:22,267 --> 00:35:23,533
You understand me?

433
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,067
Is that clear now?

434
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:28,300
I would rather die
than bow to your kind.

435
00:35:50,933 --> 00:35:52,533
Uh, are you...

436
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,800
Oh, oh, oh.

437
00:35:53,867 --> 00:35:54,967
Ahem.

438
00:35:55,067 --> 00:35:56,300
Wha... ha, ha, ha.

439
00:35:56,367 --> 00:35:58,233
Why blush?

440
00:36:05,433 --> 00:36:07,700
Your visitor is here, sir.

441
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,600
Hello, Master.

442
00:36:14,667 --> 00:36:16,600
I knew you would come.

443
00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:18,600
I had a dream

444
00:36:18,667 --> 00:36:20,767
That I would meet
a pretty girl.

445
00:36:20,833 --> 00:36:22,100
So how are you?

446
00:36:22,167 --> 00:36:23,600
What's on your mind?

447
00:36:23,667 --> 00:36:25,867
Have a seat there.

448
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:28,067
My name is Pinky Poon.

449
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,533
It wasn't my fault.

450
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,867
Please forgive me.

451
00:36:31,933 --> 00:36:33,067
Hmm?

452
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,367
Oh.

453
00:36:34,433 --> 00:36:35,500
The purse.

454
00:36:35,567 --> 00:36:36,833
That's all right.

455
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,833
You know, money should be
kept moving

456
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,500
From the rich to the poor.

457
00:36:40,567 --> 00:36:42,833
So don't you worry about it.

458
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,100
Please.

459
00:36:46,267 --> 00:36:48,200
So, your name is Pinky Poon?

460
00:36:48,267 --> 00:36:49,867
Yes.
Hmm.

461
00:36:49,933 --> 00:36:51,700
That's fine.

462
00:36:51,767 --> 00:36:54,533
You know, one of
my best friends little girl

463
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,200
Is named Pinky.

464
00:36:56,267 --> 00:36:58,733
I'd like to invite you
to share a cup of wine with me.

465
00:37:00,933 --> 00:37:02,933
I'd like to make up
for my very bad behavior.

466
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:08,867
You know, we Buddhists
don't take this wine

467
00:37:08,933 --> 00:37:10,800
Quite so seriously.

468
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,867
We call it
"Rice Colonel Tea."

469
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:18,300
But, thank you all the same.

470
00:37:20,267 --> 00:37:21,800
Ah...

471
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,133
Hmm.

472
00:37:39,767 --> 00:37:42,700
Money for the poor.

473
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,067
Money for the blind.
What's going on out here?

474
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,067
Oh, you're a beggar
and blind, too, huh?

475
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,967
Here,
take this and go on.

476
00:37:56,067 --> 00:37:57,300
Thank you.

477
00:37:57,367 --> 00:37:58,800
Hey, beggar?

478
00:37:58,867 --> 00:38:01,067
Huh?

479
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,367
Hey, beggar?

480
00:38:03,433 --> 00:38:05,300
Don't you pay
protection money?

481
00:38:11,267 --> 00:38:13,367
So you're dumb

482
00:38:13,433 --> 00:38:14,967
And blind, too?

483
00:38:17,933 --> 00:38:19,533
Where do you come from?

484
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,133
I've never seen you.

485
00:38:23,733 --> 00:38:25,600
I'll bet you talk.

486
00:38:29,267 --> 00:38:30,800
What do you want?

487
00:38:32,767 --> 00:38:34,567
Say it!

488
00:38:36,433 --> 00:38:37,700
Oh, it's you again.

489
00:38:37,767 --> 00:38:39,400
So you need another lesson,
do you?

490
00:38:39,467 --> 00:38:40,567
Okay!

491
00:38:45,767 --> 00:38:47,533
Don't you fight with me.

492
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,200
I'm pretty tough stuff.

493
00:38:50,433 --> 00:38:51,867
You're just a cheap
little mongrel.

494
00:38:51,933 --> 00:38:53,133
That's all.

495
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,467
Hiyah!

496
00:39:15,933 --> 00:39:17,167
There!

497
00:39:22,267 --> 00:39:23,533
Huh.

498
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,067
From now on,
I think you can take over

499
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,200
As a beggar.

500
00:39:26,267 --> 00:39:27,367
Hah!

501
00:39:27,433 --> 00:39:28,467
Ha, ha!

502
00:39:32,433 --> 00:39:33,867
Now relax.

503
00:39:35,433 --> 00:39:36,700
Do you like this?

504
00:39:38,267 --> 00:39:41,067
What earthly heaven is this?

505
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:44,200
Hell's temptation
is so sweet.

506
00:39:44,267 --> 00:39:45,867
But would you call this
a sin?

507
00:39:45,933 --> 00:39:48,200
Don't you touch me
like this!

508
00:39:48,267 --> 00:39:50,533
I only wanted
to please you.

509
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,200
That's all.

510
00:39:52,267 --> 00:39:54,867
Buddha,
have mercy on me.

511
00:39:54,933 --> 00:39:56,433
My flesh is so weak.

512
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,700
Massa!

513
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,200
May I come in?

514
00:40:00,267 --> 00:40:01,633
You man enter.

515
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:04,667
Reporting for duty.

516
00:40:06,433 --> 00:40:09,033
Do you know that you are
very indeed?

517
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,700
What is your reason?

518
00:40:11,767 --> 00:40:14,367
I had to travel 30 miles
in just two days.

519
00:40:14,433 --> 00:40:16,367
I'm sorry.

520
00:40:16,433 --> 00:40:17,867
I sure doubt your dedication

521
00:40:17,933 --> 00:40:19,533
To the cause.

522
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,800
Spare me.

523
00:40:20,867 --> 00:40:22,133
Have mercy on me.

524
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,800
Spare me, please?

525
00:40:23,867 --> 00:40:25,800
Have mercy on my soul.

526
00:40:25,867 --> 00:40:27,633
I don't want you around.

527
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,967
If you won't have me,

528
00:40:29,033 --> 00:40:30,767
I'll just lay down here
all the time and die.

529
00:40:30,833 --> 00:40:32,100
Damn you,
get up!

530
00:40:32,167 --> 00:40:33,700
I'll...
Hold it!

531
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,033
I'll fix you,
you little...

532
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,467
Shut up!

533
00:40:42,767 --> 00:40:45,033
That poor boy
has no home.

534
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,867
Surely you can
employ him.

535
00:40:46,933 --> 00:40:48,200
Yes, yes,
certainly I will.

536
00:40:48,267 --> 00:40:49,367
Buddha be blessed.

537
00:40:49,433 --> 00:40:50,700
I'll have him right back.

538
00:40:50,767 --> 00:40:53,367
Hey, no more monkey business,
you've got that, okay?

539
00:40:53,433 --> 00:40:56,200
But of course, boss.

540
00:40:56,267 --> 00:40:57,700
Come on.

541
00:40:57,767 --> 00:40:58,967
Okay.

542
00:41:02,433 --> 00:41:04,067
I don't want you
bullying that boy.

543
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,200
I won't.

544
00:41:05,267 --> 00:41:06,367
You understand?

545
00:41:06,433 --> 00:41:07,700
Now go about your business.

546
00:41:07,767 --> 00:41:09,133
Come on.
Mm.

547
00:41:16,433 --> 00:41:17,700
Now I have
20 bags right here.

548
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:19,367
Now you're gonna move them
without wasting any time.

549
00:41:19,433 --> 00:41:20,700
Have you got that?

550
00:41:20,767 --> 00:41:21,967
No problem.

551
00:42:06,933 --> 00:42:08,100
Ugh.

552
00:42:09,933 --> 00:42:11,567
How was that, huh?

553
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,200
Okay?

554
00:42:15,267 --> 00:42:16,533
Now, you're tops,
all right.

555
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,700
You bet.

556
00:42:17,767 --> 00:42:19,067
That was very good.

557
00:42:22,933 --> 00:42:25,200
That was wonderful.

558
00:42:25,267 --> 00:42:26,700
Where did you
learn that from?

559
00:42:26,767 --> 00:42:27,867
Huh?

560
00:42:27,933 --> 00:42:29,800
If your job
depended on it,

561
00:42:29,867 --> 00:42:31,333
You'd do amazing things
as well

562
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,800
To keep it.

563
00:42:32,867 --> 00:42:35,133
Do you want to be
my student?

564
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,467
It's much better
than working around here.

565
00:42:37,533 --> 00:42:38,533
How about it?

566
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,700
He's right, you know?

567
00:42:39,767 --> 00:42:41,200
This great master
could tell you a lot more

568
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,533
Than you know about.

569
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,633
Huh?

570
00:42:44,933 --> 00:42:46,867
You...

571
00:42:46,933 --> 00:42:48,700
Got it!

572
00:42:48,767 --> 00:42:51,067
You're the girl that was
begging around restaurant

573
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,100
The other day.

574
00:42:52,167 --> 00:42:53,433
That's right.

575
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,267
And can you guess
who he is?

576
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:57,633
He's the Grand Master
of Shaolin Temple.

577
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,067
What?

578
00:43:01,267 --> 00:43:02,533
Uh, you must forgive me.

579
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,700
I'm really sorry.

580
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,367
Forget it.

581
00:43:06,433 --> 00:43:07,867
Will you follow me then?

582
00:43:07,933 --> 00:43:09,867
Gosh, I didn't
know about that.

583
00:43:09,933 --> 00:43:12,933
Will you teach me
the Shaolin Staff Kung Fu?

584
00:43:13,067 --> 00:43:15,067
Hmm, Staff Kung Fu?
Yes.

585
00:43:15,067 --> 00:43:17,500
I'm told that every member
of Shaolin learns this.

586
00:43:17,567 --> 00:43:19,500
Uh, you ask too much.

587
00:43:19,567 --> 00:43:21,700
Forget it!

588
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:23,867
You forget that this
is a great honor.

589
00:43:23,933 --> 00:43:25,533
Don't rush me!

590
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,867
Please, I want you
to tell me some more.

591
00:43:27,933 --> 00:43:29,067
Ha.

592
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,200
Greedy.

593
00:43:30,267 --> 00:43:32,200
You just mind that you don't
ask too much of me.

594
00:43:32,267 --> 00:43:33,367
Of course not.

595
00:43:33,433 --> 00:43:34,867
I know how to strike
a good bargain.

596
00:43:34,933 --> 00:43:36,200
Well, what's your offer then?

597
00:43:36,267 --> 00:43:38,700
How about we have
a big contest then?

598
00:43:38,767 --> 00:43:41,700
And if I lose,
then you make up the rules.

599
00:43:43,933 --> 00:43:46,067
Okay then,
when do we start?

600
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:47,267
How do we start?

601
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:49,700
Now that's the kind of talk
I like to hear.

602
00:43:49,767 --> 00:43:52,700
Now miss, you be witness
to this big contest.

603
00:43:52,767 --> 00:43:54,867
All right.

604
00:43:54,933 --> 00:43:56,533
Shall we go?

605
00:43:57,933 --> 00:43:59,133
You bet.

606
00:45:01,933 --> 00:45:03,200
You go first.

607
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:04,700
All right.

608
00:45:04,767 --> 00:45:06,200
Then let's begin.

609
00:45:06,267 --> 00:45:07,467
Hmm.

610
00:46:32,267 --> 00:46:34,433
It's clear who lost.

611
00:46:37,267 --> 00:46:39,867
So what do you
have to say?

612
00:46:39,933 --> 00:46:41,533
I got nothing to say.

613
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,533
I'm only a student.

614
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,533
That's right.

615
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:46,967
I want to leave here now.

616
00:46:48,267 --> 00:46:50,200
Well, certainly.

617
00:46:50,267 --> 00:46:52,867
We'll go then.

618
00:46:52,933 --> 00:46:54,533
Student.

619
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,967
All right.

620
00:47:08,767 --> 00:47:09,967
Hey, Master.

621
00:47:11,933 --> 00:47:13,300
I was thinking just now.

622
00:47:14,767 --> 00:47:16,700
Did you and the Abbot
ever fight?

623
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:19,200
I mean,
really hate each other?

624
00:47:19,267 --> 00:47:22,200
Yes, but Master
is a man of Buddha.

625
00:47:22,267 --> 00:47:24,367
He has no time
for hate.

626
00:47:24,433 --> 00:47:26,800
To be his student
is really a great honor.

627
00:47:28,267 --> 00:47:30,533
Did you really
like each other?

628
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,533
They did.

629
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,967
Let's rest here.

630
00:47:35,067 --> 00:47:36,233
I'm tired.

631
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:43,167
Thanks.

632
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:48,867
Master,
I'm really very hungry.

633
00:47:48,933 --> 00:47:50,167
Please can I have some?

634
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:54,367
Hey, if you get so tired
after carrying so little,

635
00:47:54,433 --> 00:47:56,067
How can you be
my student?

636
00:48:03,933 --> 00:48:05,200
What is that?

637
00:48:05,267 --> 00:48:06,633
Has the sun
gotten to you?

638
00:48:09,767 --> 00:48:11,200
There's a lot
of dust in the water.

639
00:48:11,267 --> 00:48:12,867
You must filter it out.

640
00:48:12,933 --> 00:48:15,367
Otherwise, it could be
bad for you.

641
00:48:15,433 --> 00:48:17,867
If I'm gonna be
your teacher,

642
00:48:17,933 --> 00:48:20,533
You're gonna
have to smarten up.

643
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:24,367
Listen, Master,
it is all our fault.

644
00:48:24,433 --> 00:48:26,367
Won't you please
lift us out of our ignorance

645
00:48:26,433 --> 00:48:27,533
And show us Kung Fu?

646
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:28,867
We really want to learn it.

647
00:48:28,933 --> 00:48:31,367
Won't you please show us?

648
00:48:31,433 --> 00:48:32,633
Not right now.

649
00:48:37,267 --> 00:48:38,467
Um,

650
00:48:38,533 --> 00:48:40,600
I'll teach you when we get
to Chang's Village.

651
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:41,667
Ha.

652
00:48:41,733 --> 00:48:43,067
That's such a long way.

653
00:48:43,067 --> 00:48:44,333
It's over a hundred miles.

654
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,067
By the time we get there
I'll have lost interest

655
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,167
In learning your style
of Kung Fu.

656
00:48:48,233 --> 00:48:49,900
Ah.

657
00:48:49,967 --> 00:48:51,400
Take this.

658
00:48:51,467 --> 00:48:53,133
It'll keep
your mouth shut.

659
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,300
Ha...

660
00:48:54,367 --> 00:48:55,300
Hmm.

661
00:49:08,933 --> 00:49:10,067
Where you going?

662
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:11,700
Hey, have you forgotten?

663
00:49:11,767 --> 00:49:13,067
She's a woman.

664
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:15,200
She's got to do it
in the bushes.

665
00:49:15,267 --> 00:49:16,367
That's right.

666
00:49:16,433 --> 00:49:17,700
I'll be right back.

667
00:49:17,767 --> 00:49:18,800
Go on.

668
00:49:18,867 --> 00:49:20,233
Hmm.

669
00:49:36,433 --> 00:49:38,533
How dare you
assault that woman.

670
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,767
Release her at once.

671
00:49:43,633 --> 00:49:44,767
Who are you?

672
00:49:46,267 --> 00:49:48,700
He's the Master
of Shaolin Temple.

673
00:49:48,767 --> 00:49:49,800
Shaolin Temple?

674
00:49:51,433 --> 00:49:53,067
That's right.

675
00:49:53,133 --> 00:49:54,400
And if you had any sense,

676
00:49:54,467 --> 00:49:56,100
You'd get out of here
right now.

677
00:49:56,167 --> 00:49:59,700
My name is fighter Yang.

678
00:49:59,767 --> 00:50:01,200
I have walked
three whole months

679
00:50:01,267 --> 00:50:04,700
To challenge this very man
to a duel today.

680
00:50:04,767 --> 00:50:06,733
And now I have my chance.

681
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,067
Hah.

682
00:50:08,133 --> 00:50:09,233
Go on, Master.

683
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,733
You teach that guy
a good lesson.

684
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:11,867
Hmm.

685
00:50:11,933 --> 00:50:14,133
Now's your chance
to show us.

686
00:51:18,767 --> 00:51:20,200
I was losing just then.

687
00:51:20,267 --> 00:51:21,867
Why didn't you
come and help me?

688
00:51:21,933 --> 00:51:23,867
If you'd have taught me
your Shaolin Kung Fu...

689
00:51:23,933 --> 00:51:25,067
Hey...

690
00:51:25,133 --> 00:51:26,133
Listen to me.

691
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:27,467
If I beat him,
then I'm your teacher, okay?

692
00:51:27,533 --> 00:51:28,667
What's that?

693
00:51:28,733 --> 00:51:30,267
Otherwise, consider it lost.
All right.

694
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:32,800
It's a deal.

695
00:51:32,867 --> 00:51:34,067
Go ahead.

696
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:35,300
Hmm.

697
00:51:35,367 --> 00:51:37,800
We've made a deal.

698
00:51:37,867 --> 00:51:39,733
You're my witness.

699
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:43,833
Who are you?

700
00:51:48,267 --> 00:51:49,367
Master's student.

701
00:51:49,433 --> 00:51:50,700
I'm Ko Dragon.

702
00:52:59,367 --> 00:53:01,367
Now get going!

703
00:53:01,433 --> 00:53:02,867
Yes, Mr...
Yes, Master.

704
00:53:02,933 --> 00:53:04,133
Ha, ha.

705
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:12,367
That was great.

706
00:53:12,433 --> 00:53:13,700
You really beat him.

707
00:53:13,767 --> 00:53:15,067
Let me dust you off.

708
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:16,300
No thanks.

709
00:53:18,767 --> 00:53:20,967
Student, come here.

710
00:53:23,267 --> 00:53:24,800
Right now!

711
00:53:35,267 --> 00:53:36,867
Wipe the dust off me.

712
00:53:36,933 --> 00:53:38,233
Hmm?

713
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,467
I said, wipe it off!

714
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,533
You should call me
"Teacher."

715
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,800
Hmm?

716
00:54:00,067 --> 00:54:01,300
Teacher.

717
00:54:01,367 --> 00:54:03,367
Ah, ha, ha.

718
00:54:03,433 --> 00:54:04,700
From now on,

719
00:54:04,767 --> 00:54:06,067
I'm the leader.

720
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:07,100
Hmm.

721
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:09,967
Miss Poon.

722
00:54:11,767 --> 00:54:13,800
I'd like to be
your student, also.

723
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:16,200
Hmm.

724
00:54:16,267 --> 00:54:18,200
I'm not so sure.

725
00:54:18,267 --> 00:54:20,533
How can a woman
be so reliable?

726
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,833
You're really so wise.

727
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:24,100
Keep wiping!

728
00:54:31,367 --> 00:54:32,467
Hey.

729
00:54:32,533 --> 00:54:33,600
Hey!

730
00:54:36,433 --> 00:54:38,367
Hey, I'm really tired,
you know?

731
00:54:38,433 --> 00:54:40,067
And, and these...

732
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,767
These,
these packages here.

733
00:54:41,833 --> 00:54:43,767
You wanna take a rest?

734
00:54:43,833 --> 00:54:46,600
How can a student of mine
be so weak, huh?

735
00:54:46,667 --> 00:54:49,200
Hey, I'm really tired.

736
00:54:49,267 --> 00:54:50,867
And these things
are so heavy.

737
00:54:50,933 --> 00:54:52,367
Tell me,

738
00:54:52,433 --> 00:54:55,067
How can we take revenge
for the Abbot?

739
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:57,533
You need to strengthen
your body, I think.

740
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:58,967
Let's get going.

741
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,067
Hey, I can't have a slouch
for a student.

742
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:06,067
You know, not far from here
is my hometown.

743
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:08,200
Please,
let's take a rest there?

744
00:55:08,267 --> 00:55:10,133
I'll repay you for these.

745
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:13,533
Repay me?

746
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,867
But we can't stop.

747
00:55:14,933 --> 00:55:16,200
Now let's get moving.

748
00:55:16,267 --> 00:55:17,367
Come on.

749
00:55:17,433 --> 00:55:19,267
Oh, please.

750
00:55:19,333 --> 00:55:20,533
Enough!

751
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:39,533
There are so many beggars.

752
00:56:34,267 --> 00:56:36,600
You've been impolite
to a monk.

753
00:56:36,667 --> 00:56:37,800
You should be punished.

754
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:40,233
Hmm.

755
00:56:41,833 --> 00:56:43,067
Ugh!

756
00:56:50,767 --> 00:56:52,867
Hmm, although
you're in disguise,

757
00:56:52,933 --> 00:56:55,633
I know you're a master
of the Shaolin Temple.

758
00:56:57,433 --> 00:56:58,467
Hmm.

759
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:01,633
Hmm.

760
00:57:05,767 --> 00:57:07,200
Take it easy, miss.

761
00:57:07,267 --> 00:57:09,867
You know,
if you're nice to our chief,

762
00:57:09,933 --> 00:57:12,067
He'll be nice to you.

763
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:13,600
Here's the chief.

764
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,133
Chief.

765
00:57:33,433 --> 00:57:36,067
Are you the Master
of Shaolin Temple

766
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:37,700
Who wishes to take
blood revenge

767
00:57:37,767 --> 00:57:39,100
For your dead Abbot?

768
00:57:41,867 --> 00:57:42,900
I am.

769
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:47,700
Please excuse me
for treating an important guest

770
00:57:47,767 --> 00:57:49,367
Like you.

771
00:57:49,433 --> 00:57:51,067
Release him
right now.

772
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:55,967
Obey.

773
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,800
Yes.

774
00:58:08,433 --> 00:58:09,833
I appreciate your reception.

775
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:11,067
Charming.

776
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:16,067
I know you're here
for a purpose.

777
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:17,367
You'd best forget it

778
00:58:17,433 --> 00:58:18,967
While you live and breathe
this air.

779
00:58:20,933 --> 00:58:22,867
It's still not too

780
00:58:22,933 --> 00:58:25,067
To give up your ambitions.

781
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:27,400
Come back
to the ways of our Buddha.

782
00:58:30,267 --> 00:58:32,200
You still have a chance
not to die.

783
00:58:32,267 --> 00:58:33,467
Now get out of here.

784
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:36,300
If you force me

785
00:58:36,367 --> 00:58:37,467
My only way

786
00:58:37,533 --> 00:58:39,300
Is to steal your evil heart.

787
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:15,867
Bring him here.

788
01:00:15,933 --> 01:00:17,033
Mmm.

789
01:00:26,367 --> 01:00:28,033
Now I must destroy you,

790
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:29,800
You self-righteous dog you.

791
01:00:31,367 --> 01:00:33,967
Don't think
you can stop me

792
01:00:34,033 --> 01:00:35,867
By killing my mortal body.

793
01:00:35,933 --> 01:00:38,000
What rubbish.

794
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:39,500
Come here and lick my feet,

795
01:00:39,567 --> 01:00:41,233
Then I might consider
letting you go.

796
01:00:58,967 --> 01:01:00,233
Get up.

797
01:01:13,433 --> 01:01:15,800
Well, lick.

798
01:01:19,933 --> 01:01:21,467
Quick.

799
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:28,600
Lick it.

800
01:02:01,767 --> 01:02:03,867
Take him to the prison.

801
01:02:03,933 --> 01:02:04,967
Yeah.

802
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:09,300
Get up.

803
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,700
Uh, chief,

804
01:02:16,767 --> 01:02:18,300
I came here
to tell you.

805
01:02:20,267 --> 01:02:23,200
Remember I mentioned to you
about that girl?

806
01:02:23,267 --> 01:02:24,433
Hmm.

807
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:33,067
Take her inside.

808
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:34,300
Yeah.

809
01:02:48,933 --> 01:02:50,200
This is your room.

810
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:51,533
You work for the chief.

811
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:52,867
And you better please him.

812
01:02:52,933 --> 01:02:54,300
You understand?

813
01:03:12,933 --> 01:03:14,533
For the dead Abbot.

814
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,400
You're his murderer.

815
01:03:18,267 --> 01:03:19,667
You talk nonsense.

816
01:03:19,733 --> 01:03:21,067
I've done nothing.

817
01:04:16,933 --> 01:04:18,067
Ugh!

818
01:04:40,833 --> 01:04:42,200
Ahh!

819
01:05:41,767 --> 01:05:42,800
Shh!

820
01:05:45,267 --> 01:05:47,267
I've come to help you.

821
01:05:47,333 --> 01:05:48,533
Don't be afraid of me.

822
01:05:51,933 --> 01:05:53,067
Hey, hey, you.

823
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:54,333
Give me some water.

824
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,667
I'm thirsty.

825
01:05:55,733 --> 01:05:58,800
What is it, hmm?

826
01:05:58,867 --> 01:06:00,700
I need some water.

827
01:06:00,767 --> 01:06:02,067
Nah!

828
01:06:06,267 --> 01:06:07,533
What's this?

829
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,867
The chief asked me to bring
this fruit for you two.

830
01:06:09,933 --> 01:06:12,200
Oh, thank you.
Oh, thank you.

831
01:06:28,233 --> 01:06:30,933
You are all
completely useless.

832
01:06:34,433 --> 01:06:36,067
Are you all clear now?

833
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:37,367
Uh, yes, very clear.

834
01:06:37,433 --> 01:06:38,600
Yes.

835
01:06:38,667 --> 01:06:40,067
Get up.

836
01:06:49,767 --> 01:06:51,067
Come here, Chiang.

837
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:52,300
Oh, oh.

838
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:01,333
I give you exactly two days
to seize this fellow.

839
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:02,500
Yes.

840
01:07:30,067 --> 01:07:31,367
Do you feel better now?

841
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:35,700
Thank you very much.

842
01:07:35,767 --> 01:07:37,467
If not for you,
I would've died.

843
01:07:38,767 --> 01:07:40,200
Don't talk like that.

844
01:07:40,267 --> 01:07:42,200
Now you mustn't
say anything anymore.

845
01:07:42,267 --> 01:07:44,200
You have to rest yourself.

846
01:07:44,267 --> 01:07:46,333
And you must be quiet now.

847
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,267
The man who saved you
will bring you some medicine

848
01:07:48,333 --> 01:07:49,533
Very soon.

849
01:08:38,433 --> 01:08:39,800
No!... Ahh!

850
01:09:12,067 --> 01:09:13,867
Master!

851
01:09:13,933 --> 01:09:15,200
Master!

852
01:09:15,267 --> 01:09:16,633
Huh?
Wake up.

853
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:18,800
Hah, what?

854
01:09:18,867 --> 01:09:21,300
You were having
a nightmare.

855
01:09:21,367 --> 01:09:23,667
Oh.

856
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:46,800
Oh.

857
01:09:48,933 --> 01:09:50,533
It's you.

858
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,867
I have decided
to follow the dragon

859
01:09:52,933 --> 01:09:56,067
In spite of all the risks
that pose a threat to my life.

860
01:09:58,433 --> 01:10:00,200
That day in the rice fields.

861
01:10:00,267 --> 01:10:02,533
I decided to let you win.

862
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,633
To lure the dragon out.

863
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,633
Hey, come on.

864
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:50,800
Hiyah!

865
01:10:53,067 --> 01:10:54,800
Hiyah!

866
01:11:20,433 --> 01:11:21,800
Where are they?

867
01:11:38,933 --> 01:11:40,133
Stop.

868
01:11:49,933 --> 01:11:51,133
Hmm.

869
01:11:57,267 --> 01:11:58,300
Yes.

870
01:12:00,933 --> 01:12:02,400
Watch this as well.

871
01:12:10,767 --> 01:12:11,867
Sir.

872
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:15,900
Chief.

873
01:12:15,967 --> 01:12:18,367
Dragon has escaped.

874
01:12:18,433 --> 01:12:20,867
How can you be underchief
of the Wu Dong school,

875
01:12:20,933 --> 01:12:23,700
The greatest school
in the entire world?

876
01:12:23,767 --> 01:12:24,967
I have lost face.

877
01:12:26,267 --> 01:12:27,867
But he is wounded
and could not have run

878
01:12:27,933 --> 01:12:29,133
A great distance.

879
01:12:30,367 --> 01:12:32,467
I will continue to search
with my men.

880
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:35,867
Attention you.

881
01:12:35,933 --> 01:12:37,200
Search every tree.

882
01:12:37,267 --> 01:12:38,533
We must have him back...

883
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:39,867
Or there will be
dire consequences.

884
01:12:39,933 --> 01:12:41,067
Yeah.

885
01:12:52,533 --> 01:12:55,133
Master Dragon,
please come now.

886
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:56,633
Your breakfast is ready.

887
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:58,300
It'll get cold.

888
01:12:58,367 --> 01:12:59,733
Thank you, Miss Poon.

889
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,467
You're very kind.

890
01:13:01,533 --> 01:13:02,800
Don't you worry.

891
01:13:02,867 --> 01:13:04,800
When the time comes

892
01:13:04,867 --> 01:13:07,200
I will take revenge
for the Abbot

893
01:13:07,267 --> 01:13:09,200
And our loved ones
who have died at their hands.

894
01:13:09,267 --> 01:13:10,700
I stand with you,

895
01:13:10,767 --> 01:13:12,367
Because I know
you will take revenge

896
01:13:12,433 --> 01:13:13,867
Against the Wu Dong school.

897
01:13:13,933 --> 01:13:15,700
They're devils.

898
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:18,367
I would rather die

899
01:13:18,433 --> 01:13:20,867
Than leave them to commit
more of their evil ways.

900
01:13:20,933 --> 01:13:22,700
Okay, let's eat now.

901
01:13:22,767 --> 01:13:24,133
Come.

902
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,867
We found nothing, sir.
Search over there.

903
01:13:35,933 --> 01:13:37,300
Yes, sir.

904
01:14:33,733 --> 01:14:35,433
Hey.

905
01:14:36,933 --> 01:14:38,200
Come on.

906
01:14:38,267 --> 01:14:40,200
Let me do the laundry,
all right?

907
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:41,533
Are you sure about that?

908
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:42,700
I don't mind.

909
01:14:42,767 --> 01:14:43,967
Come on.

910
01:14:50,833 --> 01:14:51,933
Huh?

911
01:14:52,067 --> 01:14:53,833
Huh?

912
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:54,933
Huh?

913
01:16:56,133 --> 01:16:57,400
Ugh!

914
01:17:00,933 --> 01:17:02,133
Thank you, Master.

915
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,800
Thank you very much.
You've improved.

916
01:17:03,867 --> 01:17:05,400
Hmm.

917
01:17:14,933 --> 01:17:16,200
Good.

918
01:17:16,267 --> 01:17:18,867
In a little while,
Dragon will come for you.

919
01:17:18,933 --> 01:17:20,433
This time
you will die with him.

920
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:24,700
I wanted to die

921
01:17:24,767 --> 01:17:27,700
A long time ago
with my father

922
01:17:27,767 --> 01:17:30,067
Who also died
by your hand.

923
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:31,867
He was killed by you

924
01:17:31,933 --> 01:17:34,533
About ten years ago.

925
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:36,200
Then you are...?

926
01:17:36,267 --> 01:17:38,700
I'm the daughter
of Poon Yong Hoi.

927
01:17:38,767 --> 01:17:40,333
You killed him
ten years ago.

928
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:41,667
Huh?

929
01:17:41,733 --> 01:17:43,067
Poon Yong Hoi?

930
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:05,867
Ugh!

931
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:16,133
Ugh!

932
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:11,933
Ugh!

933
01:19:18,267 --> 01:19:20,633
Hee-Yah!

934
01:20:23,933 --> 01:20:25,300
Ahh!

935
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:29,800
Ugh.

936
01:21:59,533 --> 01:22:01,300
Release the woman now.

937
01:22:01,367 --> 01:22:02,400
Slowly.

938
01:22:08,267 --> 01:22:09,733
And don't try anything.

939
01:22:11,267 --> 01:22:14,367
You'll have to lick
my feet again first.

940
01:22:14,433 --> 01:22:15,533
Or do you think I can't

941
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,467
Humiliate you
still more?

942
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:22,700
I have knelt before you
once before...

943
01:22:22,767 --> 01:22:25,533
For that
I burn with vengeance.

944
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:28,200
I will never allow myself
to do it again.

945
01:22:28,267 --> 01:22:29,700
You just want my throne.

946
01:22:29,767 --> 01:22:31,200
That's all.

947
01:22:31,267 --> 01:22:33,800
You're very jealous,
you filthy dog.

948
01:24:57,133 --> 01:24:59,900
Ugh!

949
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:12,467
Huh?

950
01:28:42,667 --> 01:28:43,700
Ugh!

951
01:29:38,733 --> 01:29:40,300
Ugh!

952
01:29:46,933 --> 01:29:49,533
So tell me,
where do we go from here?

953
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:51,067
There's a temple
on the hill.

954
01:29:51,100 --> 01:29:52,633
Let's get married.
