1
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,397
I was just in the neighborhood.

2
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,734
I thought I'd drop off your trousers.

3
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,527
They're ready.

4
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,366
Here.

5
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,953
Just a moment.

6
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,181
Come in.

7
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,142
Straight on.

8
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,501
Perfect.

9
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,798
For the length, perhaps I need...

10
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,973
a different pair of sandals.

11
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:04,452
I always wear my trousers with a belt.

12
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:08,915
Then they fit better.

13
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,846
I'll be right back. - Okay.

14
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,342
CLOUD 9

15
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:10,777
Werner?

16
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:15,907
How much, a lot or a little? - In between.

17
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,376
The speech wasn't great, was it?

18
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,628
I can't understand a word.

19
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,632
It wasn't a very good speech.

20
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,970
He was just a cemetery orator.

21
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,474
Yes.

22
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,822
And now I'm the last of the old staff.

23
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,164
But we still have each other.

24
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:13,274
Dance with me into the morning,

25
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:20,699
Dance as our happiness grows,

26
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:29,499
Here in your arms just a-dreaming,

27
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:36,923
Sweet music dispels our sorrows.

28
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:43,138
May I ask for this tango tonight, my dear,

29
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:47,392
Said a gentleman later to her.

30
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:51,146
He was quicker and took her away from here.

31
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:55,483
Hi. - Hello.

32
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,987
I'd like to speak to Mrs. Lindner.

33
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,574
I have a jacket too. It might need some altering.

34
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,576
Inge, it's for you.

35
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,250
Yes?

36
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,502
Good afternoon.

37
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:20,717
Hello.

38
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:28,767
I have this jacket. It needs a small alteration.

39
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:33,813
I don't do alterations any more. - It can't be very much work.

40
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,526
No, it's not possible. It's not possible.

41
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,905
I can understand if it's an inconvenient moment.

42
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,909
Could I come back later?

43
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,702
No.

44
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:49,913
I'm afraid not.

45
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:52,582
Goodbye.

46
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,131
What was the problem.

47
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,052
Nothing.

48
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,221
Why?

49
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,391
Since when don't you do alterations?

50
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,561
It's all a bit much at the moment.

51
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,442
If you're sending people away, you should take down that notice.

52
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,290
I'm going to read for a bit.

53
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:37,502
Yes.

54
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:10,447
What?

55
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,126
Yes, but...

56
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,505
Sunday...

57
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:34,095
I've got the grandchildren.

58
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:40,018
I'm telling you right now, I'm not coming.

59
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:45,774
No, I don't want this any more.

60
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:49,444
Sunday at 10. Yes, I heard you.

61
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,530
If you want to wait,

62
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:55,200
that's your problem.

63
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,245
I'm not...

64
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:01,081
I'm not...

65
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:05,335
No, I don't want to.

66
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:12,133
Not at all. I've got to go now. Bye.

67
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:27,065
The balls aren't very good.

68
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,943
They look fine. You've done a fine job.

69
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,611
Do you think so?

70
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:39,953
"Steep incline" means it's going up a mountain.

71
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:43,248
You can hear it working.

72
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:47,669
Shall I show you my favorite engine?

73
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:51,214
This one. - Yes, that's a fine engine.

74
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:57,679
Have you ever heard one like this?

75
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:00,473
No? - That's this one? - Yes.

76
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,350
Thanks, Momma.

77
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:04,686
Take care.

78
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,355
Bye, Werner. Have a nice evening. - You too.

79
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,691
Bye, and thanks a lot.

80
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:12,027
See you the day after tomorrow?

81
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,779
Okay, get moving.

82
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:17,782
Let's go.

83
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:19,743
Bye, my darlings.

84
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:34,007
Front helper engine 02-0201

85
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:38,720
and engine 01-2204, pulling a special train

86
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:41,723
of the GDR Model Rail Association.

87
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:44,851
through Ottendorf station.

88
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:26,768
Engine 02...

89
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:36,601
If I ever end up like my father, you can shoot me in the woods.

90
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:56,121
Sure you don't want to come?

91
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:58,164
He's your son.

92
00:24:58,748 --> 00:25:00,500
See you tomorrow. Bye.

93
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:03,294
Have a nice trip. â€“ Enjoy your Sunday.

94
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:06,297
Say hello to the sea for me.

95
00:29:41,656 --> 00:29:46,077
Oh, you lovely rose garden,

96
00:29:46,578 --> 00:29:50,999
Oh, you lovely laurel bouquet,

97
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:55,962
Ever are you within my heart

98
00:29:56,379 --> 00:30:00,884
Never will you get away.

99
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:06,848
Father, mother won't bear our love.

100
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:11,061
Yes, my dear, you know it's true.

101
00:30:11,853 --> 00:30:16,149
Tell me the appointed hour,

102
00:30:16,608 --> 00:30:21,112
When I ought to come to you.

103
00:30:22,697 --> 00:30:26,868
I have stayed with you so often,

104
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:31,539
Lost in wonder, half the night,

105
00:30:31,956 --> 00:30:38,213
All sleep forgotten, in love...

106
00:31:06,741 --> 00:31:08,034
Here.

107
00:31:11,746 --> 00:31:13,123
Your tea.

108
00:31:19,629 --> 00:31:21,506
My, you're sweating.

109
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:47,574
God, what on earth have you caught?

110
00:31:47,949 --> 00:31:50,410
Huh, little dear? - Thanks.

111
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:27,364
I've got two hours.

112
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:03,418
My beauty.

113
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,332
It doesn't matter.

114
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,922
I'm sorry. - No.

115
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,800
Don't worry.

116
00:34:58,723 --> 00:35:00,100
Actually...

117
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:03,853
Do you know how80-year-olds screw?

118
00:35:06,523 --> 00:35:07,982
What?

119
00:35:08,525 --> 00:35:10,276
She stands on her head,

120
00:35:11,403 --> 00:35:13,905
and he lowers it in from above.

121
00:35:28,586 --> 00:35:30,171
That's a good one.

122
00:35:33,174 --> 00:35:34,551
Funny.

123
00:35:34,884 --> 00:35:36,386
For the future.

124
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:47,188
How old are you anyway? - Me?

125
00:35:48,732 --> 00:35:50,567
Seventy-six.

126
00:35:53,194 --> 00:35:55,947
We've still got four years.

127
00:36:02,495 --> 00:36:04,080
Thanks.

128
00:36:13,256 --> 00:36:15,633
Enjoy it. Bon appetit. - Thanks.

129
00:36:19,095 --> 00:36:21,765
I'll wait a bit. It's still hot.

130
00:36:29,731 --> 00:36:32,567
Do you know how 80-year-olds screw?

131
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,029
She stands on her head, and he lowers it in.

132
00:36:57,759 --> 00:37:00,762
Is that the kind of thing you tell each other in the choir?

133
00:37:01,346 --> 00:37:02,764
The choir?

134
00:37:04,182 --> 00:37:05,725
Incredible.

135
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:32,919
I wanted to tell you that I love you very much.

136
00:37:39,467 --> 00:37:40,760
Karl,

137
00:37:41,136 --> 00:37:43,471
I can't talk longer.

138
00:37:47,475 --> 00:37:49,060
Good night.

139
00:37:53,314 --> 00:37:54,858
See you soon.

140
00:39:44,634 --> 00:39:46,261
Everything okay?

141
00:39:57,689 --> 00:40:00,108
I can't stop thinking of Werner.

142
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,812
What are you doing tomorrow?

143
00:40:43,234 --> 00:40:45,362
At rain ride.

144
00:40:50,158 --> 00:40:51,618
Where to?

145
00:40:54,287 --> 00:40:56,623
I don't know. Werner always decides.

146
00:41:00,251 --> 00:41:02,170
He loves train rides.

147
00:41:08,468 --> 00:41:10,053
Just for fun?

148
00:41:12,263 --> 00:41:13,848
With no destination?

149
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:18,895
Yes, it's nice.

150
00:41:20,105 --> 00:41:22,315
Sitting by the window,

151
00:41:24,901 --> 00:41:28,321
with the countryside flying by.

152
00:41:28,655 --> 00:41:30,323
It's lovely.

153
00:41:43,461 --> 00:41:45,714
I prefer bike rides.

154
00:41:46,756 --> 00:41:49,426
Through nature. Or I walk.

155
00:41:51,594 --> 00:41:53,596
I have to...

156
00:41:55,056 --> 00:41:57,142
to touch and smell everything.

157
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:00,854
That's my thing.

158
00:42:05,025 --> 00:42:07,402
But train rides are nice too.

159
00:42:23,084 --> 00:42:25,378
Just look at this guy.

160
00:42:29,049 --> 00:42:32,969
No living creature can become as large and as old

161
00:42:34,137 --> 00:42:35,847
as a tree.

162
00:42:47,567 --> 00:42:50,945
The countryside along the train lines.

163
00:42:51,279 --> 00:42:54,157
is much prettier than along the freeways.

164
00:43:02,874 --> 00:43:04,918
But now we're here.

165
00:43:06,169 --> 00:43:08,129
Together. - Yes.

166
00:43:12,133 --> 00:43:14,302
For you this isn't a problem.

167
00:43:21,935 --> 00:43:25,105
For me this is no problem at all.

168
00:43:51,172 --> 00:43:54,676
...the soldiers can die during their overseas deployment.

169
00:43:55,051 --> 00:43:58,388
One feels for them, and has a sense of responsibility

170
00:43:58,722 --> 00:44:01,141
for the political decision taken.

171
00:44:01,474 --> 00:44:03,643
And so, I may say...

172
00:44:07,188 --> 00:44:10,358
You dropped all your ash in the pretzel sticks.

173
00:44:13,445 --> 00:44:14,946
That's disgusting.

174
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,323
...in 2004 you were asked

175
00:44:17,657 --> 00:44:20,994
how you would console a woman whose husband had died in service.

176
00:44:21,619 --> 00:44:24,956
Eighteen soldiers have already died in Afghanistan.

177
00:44:25,331 --> 00:44:28,460
And you replied: "It's no consolation,

178
00:44:28,793 --> 00:44:31,838
but he died a meaningful death."

179
00:44:32,172 --> 00:44:36,176
Do you still think this? - Yes, I'm convinced of it.

180
00:44:37,635 --> 00:44:41,014
Well, I don't think there should be soldiers any more.

181
00:44:43,725 --> 00:44:45,769
If a man wants to be a soldier,

182
00:44:46,227 --> 00:44:49,105
he should have to ask his mother to sign her permission.

183
00:44:49,439 --> 00:44:51,149
And if she doesn't,

184
00:44:51,483 --> 00:44:54,194
the man shouldn't be allowed to become a soldier.

185
00:44:58,865 --> 00:45:00,450
Globally.

186
00:45:01,201 --> 00:45:04,329
...but I'm still convinced it's right for us to intervene.

187
00:45:04,662 --> 00:45:09,125
We are still defending Germany, even in the Hindu Kush.

188
00:45:27,394 --> 00:45:29,062
Look at the trees.

189
00:45:33,525 --> 00:45:35,568
The countryside by the train lines.

190
00:45:35,902 --> 00:45:38,613
is much prettier than by the freeways.

191
00:45:52,627 --> 00:45:54,337
What's the matter.

192
00:45:59,843 --> 00:46:01,970
It's so pretty.

193
00:46:30,707 --> 00:46:32,459
Really?

194
00:46:32,792 --> 00:46:35,837
Yes. - Seriously?

195
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:38,506
Yes.

196
00:46:39,841 --> 00:46:41,384
Really.

197
00:46:49,267 --> 00:46:51,770
Good grief, this is...

198
00:46:53,313 --> 00:46:54,981
This is news.

199
00:46:57,942 --> 00:47:00,945
I told myself it just couldn't be happening.

200
00:47:05,408 --> 00:47:08,495
Momma! - I was immediately...

201
00:47:10,747 --> 00:47:13,750
I had these instant butterflies in my stomach.

202
00:47:15,585 --> 00:47:17,796
But that's just...

203
00:47:18,129 --> 00:47:20,799
I mean...

204
00:47:21,299 --> 00:47:23,301
Momma. - I'm always...

205
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:28,264
I long for him constantly.

206
00:47:36,106 --> 00:47:40,026
I can't do this, not like this.

207
00:47:43,738 --> 00:47:46,783
Why not? - It's wonderful, but I can't...

208
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,413
I can't be in the apartment

209
00:47:52,956 --> 00:47:55,500
as if nothing had happened.

210
00:47:55,959 --> 00:47:57,919
What year are you living in?

211
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:04,092
No, I can't just pretend... - Yes, you can.

212
00:48:06,052 --> 00:48:07,762
You can see him.

213
00:48:08,471 --> 00:48:10,223
But you have to...

214
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:13,184
Nobody except us...

215
00:48:15,228 --> 00:48:18,982
...should know? - No way.

216
00:48:21,234 --> 00:48:24,362
Momma, this is wonderful.

217
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:28,867
Enjoy it. Just enjoy it.

218
00:48:32,037 --> 00:48:34,039
We won't tell anyone.

219
00:48:37,834 --> 00:48:39,336
Thanks.

220
00:48:44,507 --> 00:48:46,384
With nice puckered lips.

221
00:48:58,104 --> 00:49:00,273
Perfect. Now mezzo forte.

222
00:49:05,987 --> 00:49:07,113
Right!

223
00:50:44,669 --> 00:50:46,421
Now back.

224
00:50:51,885 --> 00:50:53,511
Hold, hold.

225
00:51:02,103 --> 00:51:03,313
Hold.

226
00:51:04,147 --> 00:51:05,648
And down.

227
00:51:17,952 --> 00:51:20,205
Oh, man. - Up.

228
00:51:22,791 --> 00:51:24,042
Down.

229
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:57,409
Say that again.

230
00:52:01,496 --> 00:52:03,164
Yes, it's true.

231
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:06,292
I'm sorry.

232
00:52:09,254 --> 00:52:11,631
Have you lost your marbles?

233
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:19,055
How long has it been going on?

234
00:52:21,933 --> 00:52:24,102
A few weeks.

235
00:52:44,748 --> 00:52:46,791
I'm really sorry, I tell you.

236
00:52:47,292 --> 00:52:49,544
Stop your blubbering!

237
00:52:53,048 --> 00:52:56,676
I don't want to cry, but it's so sad.

238
00:53:01,181 --> 00:53:04,184
It isn't as if I don't care for you any more.

239
00:53:06,895 --> 00:53:10,565
But it just... It just happened.

240
00:53:12,859 --> 00:53:14,652
I didn't want it.

241
00:53:18,365 --> 00:53:20,617
I hoped it would pass.

242
00:53:26,998 --> 00:53:29,000
Stop moaning.

243
00:53:39,928 --> 00:53:42,055
I'm so sorry.

244
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,643
Get lost!

245
00:54:06,788 --> 00:54:08,957
If only I hadn't told you.

246
00:54:14,462 --> 00:54:16,715
This isn't solving anything.

247
00:54:19,092 --> 00:54:21,553
So what do you think I should do?

248
00:54:24,097 --> 00:54:26,349
Congratulate you?

249
00:54:29,019 --> 00:54:31,187
Got yourself a younger guy, huh?

250
00:54:31,563 --> 00:54:34,149
He fucks better than me, or what?

251
00:54:35,275 --> 00:54:37,861
I don't think it's right to say...

252
00:54:40,989 --> 00:54:43,742
I helped to raise your kids. "Now you can get lost."

253
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:46,703
What's going on in your mind?

254
00:54:48,121 --> 00:54:51,916
If you want to leave, I understand. - Oh, you want me to leave you.

255
00:54:53,251 --> 00:54:56,129
Who "fell in love," me or you?

256
00:55:02,886 --> 00:55:05,597
Me, but... - But?

257
00:55:09,184 --> 00:55:11,227
There must be a reason.

258
00:55:11,603 --> 00:55:13,229
Of course there is.

259
00:55:14,272 --> 00:55:16,858
You live for the moment.

260
00:55:18,151 --> 00:55:20,862
I always thought you were so wonderfully naive.

261
00:55:21,237 --> 00:55:23,823
What's that supposed to mean?

262
00:55:24,157 --> 00:55:26,034
You don't think about things.

263
00:55:28,953 --> 00:55:31,623
You just live for the moment.

264
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:33,917
Really? - Yes.

265
00:55:35,627 --> 00:55:38,046
So that's how you see me. - Yes.

266
00:55:41,383 --> 00:55:43,843
You're not acting very intelligently.

267
00:55:46,429 --> 00:55:49,307
That's interesting. - Yes.

268
00:55:50,183 --> 00:55:52,102
You're being stupid.

269
00:55:55,939 --> 00:55:57,899
It's for you to decide.

270
00:55:59,109 --> 00:56:00,735
Not me.

271
00:56:05,156 --> 00:56:07,826
That's what I'm doing. -Well, do it.

272
00:56:17,043 --> 00:56:19,295
After living together for so long

273
00:56:19,629 --> 00:56:21,798
we should be able to talk to each other

274
00:56:22,173 --> 00:56:24,259
if something like this happens.

275
00:57:01,129 --> 00:57:03,048
I'm going to the garden.

276
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,300
Have fun.

277
00:57:13,391 --> 00:57:16,144
Are you staying home today? - I don't know.

278
00:57:26,988 --> 00:57:29,366
Will you come over later? - No!

279
00:57:31,034 --> 00:57:33,370
Come on, listen. - Get lost!

280
00:57:33,703 --> 00:57:35,121
Listen...

281
00:57:37,332 --> 00:57:39,668
Just leave me alone.

282
00:57:41,419 --> 00:57:43,213
I really am sorry.

283
00:57:44,297 --> 00:57:46,049
Please go.

284
00:57:50,345 --> 00:57:52,263
I said go.

285
00:57:59,437 --> 00:58:01,272
Leave me alone.

286
00:58:03,775 --> 00:58:05,235
Bye.

287
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:22,270
Normally, I ought to be happy now.

288
00:59:29,069 --> 00:59:31,279
You can always come to me.

289
00:59:34,032 --> 00:59:35,658
If you want to.

290
00:59:47,504 --> 00:59:52,008
Perhaps I'm already too old for this sort of thing.

291
01:00:01,768 --> 01:00:04,938
I always hoped I'd fall in love again properly.

292
01:00:10,485 --> 01:00:12,821
But I stopped expecting it.

293
01:00:18,868 --> 01:00:21,913
Perhaps we should go away somewhere.

294
01:00:25,583 --> 01:00:27,002
Where?

295
01:00:29,337 --> 01:00:31,256
Some place you like.

296
01:00:54,654 --> 01:00:56,531
Where have you been?

297
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:02,537
That's my business.

298
01:01:09,127 --> 01:01:11,046
Were you with your guy?

299
01:01:24,142 --> 01:01:27,312
Do you intend to make this place your second home?

300
01:01:28,063 --> 01:01:31,274
What's wrong with you? -What's wrong with me?

301
01:01:32,817 --> 01:01:35,570
Are you drunk? - I'm not drunk.

302
01:01:36,112 --> 01:01:37,906
It sure looks like it.

303
01:01:38,865 --> 01:01:41,201
I want to know where you were.

304
01:01:41,993 --> 01:01:44,579
It doesn't concern you. It's my business.

305
01:01:44,913 --> 01:01:46,289
Your business.

306
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:48,792
You fuck him all day and all evening,

307
01:01:49,125 --> 01:01:51,211
and then come back here to rest.

308
01:01:51,544 --> 01:01:55,799
You're behaving like a child. Have you gone senile, or what?

309
01:01:56,174 --> 01:01:59,594
Don't touch me, stop.

310
01:02:01,304 --> 01:02:02,681
Are you crazy?

311
01:02:03,014 --> 01:02:06,518
If anyone's crazy here it's you. - Let me go.

312
01:02:08,395 --> 01:02:10,105
Stop hitting me.

313
01:02:10,438 --> 01:02:13,316
I'm not hitting you. But I want to know what's going on.

314
01:02:13,817 --> 01:02:16,361
What's going on? I told you.

315
01:02:16,945 --> 01:02:19,030
Aren't you ashamed, at your age?

316
01:02:22,283 --> 01:02:24,869
Inge, I don't have much time left.

317
01:02:25,203 --> 01:02:28,957
Neither do l. Just because I'm over sixty,

318
01:02:30,375 --> 01:02:33,253
I have to sit here in the dumps for twenty years?

319
01:02:36,006 --> 01:02:38,508
What's my age got to do with it? 

320
01:02:39,634 --> 01:02:43,930
It doesn't matter if I'm 16 or 60... or 80.

321
01:02:45,265 --> 01:02:47,434
It does matter.

322
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:51,354
Perhaps, but at the moment that's the way I feel.

323
01:02:56,317 --> 01:02:58,486
I wish this hadn't happened to me.

324
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:00,947
But it has, so what should I do?

325
01:03:01,281 --> 01:03:02,699
And me?

326
01:03:03,742 --> 01:03:07,328
Should I sit on my chair with my legs crossed?

327
01:03:11,583 --> 01:03:14,753
Watching you carrying on?

328
01:03:16,588 --> 01:03:19,007
That's so mean, what you're saying.

329
01:03:19,341 --> 01:03:21,801
I'm not "carrying on."

330
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:24,596
It's an awful situation for me.

331
01:03:25,013 --> 01:03:28,058
We've been together for 30 years.

332
01:03:29,434 --> 01:03:31,394
What do you think you're doing?

333
01:03:35,023 --> 01:03:37,108
You've got to decide for once.

334
01:03:37,442 --> 01:03:40,403
You've got to think about what you're doing.

335
01:03:40,737 --> 01:03:44,032
Stop being such a silly brat.

336
01:03:46,993 --> 01:03:50,622
That's just so mean.

337
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:54,709
Why accuse me of being a silly brat

338
01:03:55,043 --> 01:03:57,712
just because I feel something different?

339
01:04:00,674 --> 01:04:03,718
That's no argument.

340
01:04:04,636 --> 01:04:06,346
Perhaps not.

341
01:04:13,019 --> 01:04:15,313
But you're only thinking about yourself.

342
01:04:16,189 --> 01:04:18,024
That's not true at all.

343
01:04:18,358 --> 01:04:23,279
Do you think this isn't painful for me?

344
01:04:24,698 --> 01:04:28,410
But I can't change the fact that it's happening.

345
01:04:29,536 --> 01:04:32,080
And all you can do is lay into me.

346
01:04:32,414 --> 01:04:35,291
What's the point of that?

347
01:04:38,044 --> 01:04:40,296
Werner, tell me.

348
01:04:41,131 --> 01:04:45,719
If one of us can change what's happening, it's you not me.

349
01:04:46,803 --> 01:04:48,179
I feel...

350
01:05:00,567 --> 01:05:03,695
Let's get some sleep and talk about it again tomorrow.

351
01:05:07,615 --> 01:05:10,452
We'll just go round in circles.

352
01:05:28,636 --> 01:05:31,139
How can you make such a mess?

353
01:05:55,622 --> 01:05:57,374
I can't help you.

354
01:06:06,091 --> 01:06:08,802
But let's not be nasty to one another.

355
01:06:17,018 --> 01:06:19,062
I'm so sorry.

356
01:09:20,618 --> 01:09:22,037
Werner?

357
01:09:28,793 --> 01:09:30,211
Werner?

358
01:10:25,433 --> 01:10:26,935
Hi.

359
01:10:27,310 --> 01:10:29,270
Morning, it's Momma.

360
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:34,067
I just wanted to ask if Werner called you?

361
01:10:39,364 --> 01:10:41,282
No, I just wanted...

362
01:10:46,121 --> 01:10:48,289
I'll ring you again later.

363
01:10:53,670 --> 01:10:56,131
No, get the kids ready first.

364
01:10:56,923 --> 01:10:58,800
I'll call you later.

365
01:11:01,594 --> 01:11:03,179
Talk to you later.

366
01:11:32,709 --> 01:11:34,586
Was it necessary, Momma?

367
01:11:40,216 --> 01:11:41,509
Yes.

368
01:11:48,433 --> 01:11:50,560
My God, poor Werner.

369
01:11:53,897 --> 01:11:55,732
What were you thinking?

370
01:11:56,608 --> 01:11:58,943
What do you mean, "poor Werner"?

371
01:12:00,612 --> 01:12:02,655
You wanted to keep it to yourself.

372
01:12:02,989 --> 01:12:05,992
That's what we agreed.

373
01:12:07,202 --> 01:12:11,122
I want to tell the truth, so I can look Werner in the eye.

374
01:12:11,456 --> 01:12:14,250
It wasn't possible any more. What do you think I should do?

375
01:12:15,126 --> 01:12:18,129
Be with another man, arrange to see him,

376
01:12:18,463 --> 01:12:21,508
And lie through my teeth to Werner? â€“ Exactly that.

377
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:27,764
At least that way you wouldn't cause so much pain.

378
01:12:30,350 --> 01:12:33,019
You're putting the family in jeopardy.

379
01:12:45,907 --> 01:12:48,410
I'm sorry, I can't.

380
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:55,750
You're like a stranger.

381
01:12:57,711 --> 01:12:59,713
Sorry, but...

382
01:13:04,592 --> 01:13:06,428
You're so hard.

383
01:13:07,470 --> 01:13:10,724
Yes, it's strange when someone puts herself first suddenly.

384
01:13:11,057 --> 01:13:15,103
I can see that. It was never an issue.

385
01:13:15,729 --> 01:13:20,650
Whether I had any personal dreams, desires or whatever.

386
01:13:20,984 --> 01:13:23,862
That was never an issue.

387
01:13:24,195 --> 01:13:26,906
But you could fall on your face. -Yes, I know.

388
01:13:28,324 --> 01:13:31,745
But still... I'm coming in five minutes.

389
01:13:32,078 --> 01:13:34,831
Five more minutes. Go and play out back.

390
01:13:35,707 --> 01:13:37,167
Sorry.

391
01:13:38,168 --> 01:13:42,005
Surely I can have a chat with Grandma for five minutes.

392
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:49,429
Think it over, Momma. Please.

393
01:13:55,602 --> 01:13:58,980
You just can't do this to Werner.

394
01:14:06,696 --> 01:14:09,366
We're in a fine mess now.

395
01:14:10,825 --> 01:14:14,871
This is just what I wanted to avoid.

396
01:14:20,835 --> 01:14:22,796
What a mess.

397
01:14:23,672 --> 01:14:25,548
Let's get some coffee.

398
01:14:27,467 --> 01:14:28,968
Yes.

399
01:14:37,310 --> 01:14:41,314
Scoff at worldly destiny.

400
01:14:42,899 --> 01:14:46,903
Three things they have shown me today:

401
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:51,074
How from this life to gain insight,

402
01:14:51,449 --> 01:14:55,328
How to smoke, sleep, waste it away,

403
01:14:55,662 --> 01:14:59,833
How to give it threefold spite,

404
01:15:04,754 --> 01:15:09,092
How to give it threefold spite.

405
01:15:10,427 --> 01:15:14,472
The gypsies lingered in my gaze,

406
01:15:14,806 --> 01:15:18,018
As I traveled on my ways.

407
01:16:45,855 --> 01:16:47,273
Wardrobe.

408
01:16:48,066 --> 01:16:50,485
I've already cleared out my stuff.

409
01:16:52,570 --> 01:16:55,573
And the writing desk can hold a lot.

410
01:16:56,074 --> 01:16:59,160
This has got to go.

411
01:17:00,286 --> 01:17:01,871
It doesn't belong here.

412
01:17:04,541 --> 01:17:05,875
You sleep there,

413
01:17:06,543 --> 01:17:08,712
and I'll get set up in here.

414
01:17:10,296 --> 01:17:13,717
So you can gather your wits.

415
01:17:23,977 --> 01:17:26,021
I've made something to eat.

416
01:17:26,855 --> 01:17:28,356
Join me? - Yes.

417
01:17:34,404 --> 01:17:36,072
As a welcome.

418
01:17:39,409 --> 01:17:40,827
Are you happy?

419
01:17:47,042 --> 01:17:48,335
Yes.

420
01:17:59,346 --> 01:18:01,056
I'm seventy-six.

421
01:18:02,057 --> 01:18:04,851
At my age, you don't know how long you've got left.

422
01:18:10,899 --> 01:18:12,525
Why are you doing this?

423
01:18:12,859 --> 01:18:15,445
It's only worth it for the things you never had.

424
01:18:15,779 --> 01:18:17,489
She's my daughter.

425
01:18:17,822 --> 01:18:22,285
I don't suppose you expect anything but contempt from me.

426
01:18:25,955 --> 01:18:28,458
...but as of Wednesday there is another number:

427
01:18:28,792 --> 01:18:31,336
The child-protection hotline...

428
01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:33,922
...unstable, with heavy rain...

429
01:18:57,904 --> 01:19:02,450
Three, two, one, zero!

430
01:19:09,624 --> 01:19:12,877
We're sailing over the lake.

431
01:19:13,211 --> 01:19:15,088
We're sailing over the...

432
01:19:23,013 --> 01:19:26,808
With a big wooden root stick.

433
01:19:27,142 --> 01:19:29,811
With a big wooden root stick, and no oar.

434
01:20:06,222 --> 01:20:08,600
Could you take off my watch?

435
01:20:17,317 --> 01:20:18,693
Thanks.

436
01:20:40,006 --> 01:20:42,175
We can even still sing together.

437
01:20:50,433 --> 01:20:52,769
When did we do that for the first time?

438
01:20:53,770 --> 01:20:55,939
My God!

439
01:20:56,606 --> 01:20:58,733
Petra was still very little.

440
01:20:59,943 --> 01:21:01,486
Yes.

441
01:21:02,237 --> 01:21:05,198
The same age as Laura now. - Right.

442
01:21:08,785 --> 01:21:11,621
Do you remember carrying her through the sunflower field?

443
01:21:11,955 --> 01:21:12,997
Yes.

444
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:16,251
She was so small. She couldn't see over the tops.

445
01:21:16,584 --> 01:21:18,962
She was crying, and you put her on your shoulders,

446
01:21:19,295 --> 01:21:20,964
piggy-back.

447
01:21:21,423 --> 01:21:23,216
She was thrilled.

448
01:21:25,093 --> 01:21:29,180
At that moment you won her heart. That's when you became her dad.

449
01:22:06,468 --> 01:22:07,886
I'll be off.

450
01:23:23,795 --> 01:23:25,755
What were you thinking of exactly,

451
01:23:27,048 --> 01:23:30,552
bringing my trousers round to the apartment?

452
01:23:35,473 --> 01:23:37,726
I wanted to see you again.

453
01:23:40,478 --> 01:23:42,022
I liked you.

454
01:23:44,274 --> 01:23:45,859
You did?

455
01:23:48,611 --> 01:23:52,198
The first time you came to our place

456
01:23:52,615 --> 01:23:55,035
with your trousers, for a fitting,

457
01:23:56,911 --> 01:23:58,913
you kept giving me the eye.

458
01:24:03,084 --> 01:24:07,672
Well, you were certainly taking the measure of... things.

459
01:24:16,890 --> 01:24:18,475
I thought:

460
01:24:19,225 --> 01:24:22,062
He seems to fancy you.

461
01:24:24,814 --> 01:24:27,400
What, you noticed?

462
01:24:36,284 --> 01:24:38,286
Do you always do that?

463
01:24:38,828 --> 01:24:43,750
A woman knocks at your door, and you throw her onto the carpet.

464
01:24:45,585 --> 01:24:47,128
Always. 

465
01:24:56,012 --> 01:24:58,139
I love sleeping with you.

466
01:25:11,069 --> 01:25:13,571
And I love sleeping with you.

467
01:25:24,332 --> 01:25:28,586
Whoever has been fortunate

468
01:25:28,962 --> 01:25:33,049
to find a friend indeed,

469
01:25:33,466 --> 01:25:37,637
He who has won a lovely maid,

470
01:25:38,013 --> 01:25:42,225
Join our cheering company.

471
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:46,730
Yes, he who just one soul can call

472
01:25:47,105 --> 01:25:50,608
his own, his own upon the earth.

473
01:25:50,942 --> 01:25:55,363
But he who never could at all,

474
01:25:55,780 --> 01:26:00,035
weeping from our throng go forth.

475
01:26:29,272 --> 01:26:31,691
Werner, I think it's better if we separate.

476
01:26:38,907 --> 01:26:41,076
I'll look for my own place at first.

477
01:26:49,459 --> 01:26:51,836
I'm just fetching a few things.

478
01:26:57,258 --> 01:27:00,136
What we do with the furniture...

479
01:27:04,391 --> 01:27:06,559
We can discuss that later.

480
01:27:44,597 --> 01:27:46,683
Would you like a drink?

481
01:27:50,562 --> 01:27:52,731
I'll open a bottle of wine.

482
01:28:07,787 --> 01:28:10,707
I was often surprised these last few weeks.

483
01:28:12,083 --> 01:28:14,753
You sometimes looked like a young girl.

484
01:28:17,005 --> 01:28:19,132
Now I know why.

485
01:28:28,933 --> 01:28:31,144
I didn't want this.

486
01:28:35,857 --> 01:28:37,734
It just happened.

487
01:28:43,365 --> 01:28:45,617
What did I do wrong?

488
01:28:46,368 --> 01:28:49,079
You didn't do anything wrong.

489
01:28:51,831 --> 01:28:54,959
Otherwise we couldn't have lived together for 30 years.

490
01:29:04,761 --> 01:29:06,971
Perhaps everything has its time.

491
01:29:15,063 --> 01:29:16,940
I would never have thought

492
01:29:17,732 --> 01:29:20,276
this could still happen to us.

493
01:29:36,918 --> 01:29:40,714
Perhaps you'll forgive me some day.

494
01:32:09,195 --> 01:32:11,031
Danneberg.

495
01:32:11,906 --> 01:32:13,992
Yes, I'm Karl.

496
01:32:16,244 --> 01:32:18,288
Yes.

497
01:32:36,556 --> 01:32:38,308
Hold on.

498
01:32:41,186 --> 01:32:42,645
Just a moment.

499
01:33:00,872 --> 01:33:02,457
Inge,

500
01:33:03,166 --> 01:33:04,834
it's your daughter.

501
01:33:05,168 --> 01:33:06,795
Petra?

502
01:33:07,962 --> 01:33:09,506
Hello.

503
01:33:10,465 --> 01:33:12,467
Yes, what?

504
01:33:14,177 --> 01:33:15,595
What's wrong?

505
01:33:20,350 --> 01:33:22,268
Is it...?

506
01:33:26,106 --> 01:33:27,649
What?

507
01:33:33,238 --> 01:33:34,656
What?

508
01:33:35,782 --> 01:33:37,117
What?

509
01:33:47,252 --> 01:33:49,796
No, it can't be true.

510
01:33:53,717 --> 01:33:55,218
Sorry.

511
01:33:57,637 --> 01:33:58,972
What?

512
01:33:59,305 --> 01:34:00,932
No.

513
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:14,446
Inge.

514
01:34:14,988 --> 01:34:16,573
Werner, he's...

515
01:34:32,130 --> 01:34:34,132
I didn't want this.

516
01:34:39,763 --> 01:34:42,015
It can't be true.

517
01:35:23,139 --> 01:35:25,141
It's my fault.

518
01:35:33,316 --> 01:35:35,402
It's my fault.

519
01:36:55,315 --> 01:36:56,816
Come on, Momma.

520
01:39:23,338 --> 01:39:25,924
