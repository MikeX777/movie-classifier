alone in the street?

00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,936
- I wasn't gonna go in without you.

- I know.
- We're supposed to be doing this.

00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,972
- Having these... these wild adventures.
- Ooh, yeah.

Embrace it.

00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,853
- See where I'm going here?
- I see. I... Yeah.

16
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,146

Okay, but I'm gonna pick
a terrible, sappy song.

22
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,971

- They'll make great...

00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:03,998

- Oh, you're good.

00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,501
I can help you pick.

25
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:08,585
What?

26
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,046
- Your song.
- Oh.

27
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,258
I typically save my suggestions
for people in costume, but...

28
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:17,137
Oh, well, then you're confused.
I am in costume.

00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,432
Oh. Like, if I like squint my eyes
and tilt my head?

00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,977
- Hold on. Give me a second.
- I'm with you.

- Yeah.

- It's good, right?
- Yeah.

35
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:33,778
- It... it's on the weaker side of costumes.
- The weaker side?

36
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,823
Well, I was dragged here against my will.

37
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,450
And I'm sorry,
but you're not really one to talk,

Mr. White T-shirt Ferris Bueller.

00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,431
You didn't really have to go all out
for that one, did you?

40
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:47,750
This is iconic. This is movie magic.
Okay? And frankly,

41
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,628
I think your anti-party ass
could use a little Ferris.

42
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:55,675
Are you always this confident,
or is this the Ferris Bueller act?

43
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,135
He's always this confident.

44
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:59,262
- I can answer that. Buddy?
- Good to know.

We didn't introduce ourselves.

It's not really Halloween
without candy.

00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,732
- Right? Like we kinda have... Yeah, come on.
- Wait.

71
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:38,903
Isn't it cheating
if we, like, buy it though?

72
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,781
More than stuffing on a party hat
and calling it a Halloween costume?

73
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:44,659
I didn't realize I was talking
to the mayor of Halloween right now.

74
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,786
See, you are though. There was a vote.

75
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:50,581
- Must've been before I moved back.
- Moved back? You used to live here?

76
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:54,794
Yeah, that's how I know Stella.
I moved away in the first grade.

77
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:58,548
Since then,
it's been six schools in three states.

78
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,550
Yeah.

79
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,386
It's why I don't spend
too much time being social.

80
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,805
I'd rather focus
on getting into a good school.

81
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:08,474
Oh! So that's why we never met.
You're a nerd.

82
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:09,976
Yeah.

83
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,317
Oh, miss.

84
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,488
So I'm in a band.

85
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,450
Oh my God, of course you're in a band.

86
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,410
It all makes sense.

87
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,996
Okay, you said it like it was a bad word.

88
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,709
No, but I bet it's actually good.
Which is the annoying part,

89
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,794
'cause it should be bad.
But I'm sure it's great.

90
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,087
Why is it annoying?

91
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:42,383
'Cause I bet you're one of those people
that's, like, good at everything.

92
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:48,348
The rest of us are out here overthinking,
and you're the king of karaoke.

93
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:53,436
I bet you're gonna go off
and become, like, a famous musician.

94
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,357
Actually, it's gonna be med school for me.

95
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,274
Hmm.

96
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,360
Yeah, both my parents are doctors,

97
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:03,154
so they kind of expect me
to follow in their footsteps.

98
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,656
But you don't want that?

99
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,202
I mean, my dream, honestly,

100
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,080
would be to apply to Berklee.

101
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:16,626
It's my favorite music school,
but my parents don't think it's practical.

102
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,132
Well, then you should change their minds.

103
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,014
Come on.

104
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,605
There.

105
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,944
I mean, you get into the perfect school.
And then what? What's next?

106
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,030
And then I become a lawyer.

107
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,659
I'm gonna fight for people
that need protecting.

108
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,577
Something my mom and I talked about.

109
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,163
Like the next RBG.

110
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,417
Sounds like you got
your whole future mapped out.

111
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,210
Yeah, I don't know.

112
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,338
You move around as much as I do,
and you crave a little stability.

113
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,345
My parents were
actually high school sweethearts

114
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,430
that didn't pan out.

115
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:16,269
And since the divorce,
my mom's kind of taken us all over,

116
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:19,772
and usually, each stop means
falling in love with a new guy.

117
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,817
And right now, that guy is Steve.

118
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,069
- We don't like Steve.
- He's fine.

119
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:28,781
But no, I'm just...
I give her credit for never giving up.

120
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,825
I mean, she just...

121
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:34,537
I don't know, she sounds
like a hopeless romantic.

122
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,455
Maybe.

123
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,918
I just don't wanna...

124
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,922
...make the same mistakes she did.

125
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:48,843
Yeah.

126
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:52,930
<i>One...</i>

127
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,267
two...

128
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,603
Three!

129
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,149
Sorry.

130
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,038
- I think it's gonna rain.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

131
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:21,542
And we're still, like,
six blocks from my house.

132
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:23,377
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

133
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,337
All right.

134
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:27,590
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

135
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:42,812
This is me.

136
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:48,236
I'm glad to have witnessed
you live up to your party-animal name.

137
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,319
Mmm.

138
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,201
I'm not looking for a boyfriend.

139
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,648
- Oh, yeah...
- I'm sorry.

140
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,122
You didn't even ask and...

141
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,793
I'm just afraid. We've had this night.
If we kiss, we'll wanna kiss again.

142
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,116
Or at least I will,
and I don't wanna do this whole thing

143
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,839
if we'll break each other's hearts
in ten months when we graduate.

144
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,341
I'm sorry.

145
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,845
What? Why do we have
to break each other's hearts?

146
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,640
This whole thing,
high school, this is the prologue.

147
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,684
It sets the stage
for the rest of our lives,

148
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:23,020
and no offense, but I'm not
gonna be taking my prologue with me.

149
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,275
Okay, you think I'm insane. Look.

150
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,822
We... we... Okay.
We... we... we can kiss. That's fine.

151
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:36,617
But I just...
I needed you to know all the facts,

152
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:37,702
'cause, like, I...

153
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,253
- So... okay, that...
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

154
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,776
- I think you need a new plan.
- My plan's pretty set.

155
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,050
It doesn't include me, so I'd like
to make an amendment if I may.

156
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:54,969
I'll allow it.

157
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:58,598
Okay, how about... we kiss again?

158
00:09:58,681 --> 00:09:59,515
Mmm.

159
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,559
If that kiss leads to something else,

160
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,979
then we make it
the best year ever, you know?

161
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,981
And then we'll just end it. It's done.

162
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:10,651
- Like a breakup pact?
- I'm proposing a breakup pact.

163
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,297
So what's gonna happen
in ten months when this is over?

164
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:16,032
I'll take you on
some kind of epic date, you know?

165
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,327
And then... and then...
and then we just go our separate ways

166
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,703
to close out the...

167
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,039
- Prologue. Yeah.
- Prologue. That's the one.

168
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:25,498
Do we have a deal?

169
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,133
Deal.

170
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,012
- <i>Hi.</i>
- Hi.

171
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,095
<i>Um...</i>

172
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:43,059
<i>Yeah, I'll just go for it.
I'd like to take you on a proper date</i>

173
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:46,562
<i>to see a band I'm pretty confident
will be your new favorite.</i>

174
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,688
Are you now?

175
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,650
Whoo!

176
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,669
<i>- Saw you dancing.
- I heard music.</i>

177
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:56,113
I might have moved a little.
If anything, I just did like this.

178
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:00,242
- If that's the base, it started there.
- That's a light swaying.

179
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:04,413
- It was also like this right here.
- My arms were not up.

What if he takes you
hot-air ballooning tonight?

213
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,597
He's not taking me hot-air ballooning.

214
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,933
For your last date?
Clare, he could get a bunch of doves,

215
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,351
fricking release them,

216
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,813
and they assemble the words
"Clare, we can make it" in the sky.

217
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,273
Come on.

218
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:56,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

219
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,655
If a girl sent me doves, I'd be done for.

220
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:05,075
That would require you
to actually talk to a girl.

221
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,119
"Require you
to actually talk to a girl."

222
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:10,915
For your information, I'm working
a very diligent long game with Tess, okay?

223
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,334
- Long game, now?
- Yes, it's very long.

224
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,795
Well, the long game's
gonna have to speed it up

225
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,505
because time is running out.

226
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,508
Time's kind of running out
for you too, dude.

227
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:23,636
It's for the best.

228
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:26,806
I'm not gonna be like my parents, Stel.
I'm not doing that.

229
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,015
Okay.

230
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,811
Casually pivoting,

231
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:36,315
uh, I think a few people are
maybe going to South Point Beach later...

232
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:40,778
- Tess is going to South Point Beach later.
- Don't make me sound like a stalker, dude.

233
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:43,280
- I'm not.
<i>- </i>We did<i> Spring Awakening </i>together.

234
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,198
We're bonded.

235
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:46,575
That's one
of Broadway's horniest musicals.

236
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,952
It was hot and heavy.

237
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,663
Mrs. G didn't even make us
do the junior version.

238
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:54,083
- We straight up got to do regular.
- I think you should message her.

239
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,211
I think you should slide into her DMs,
but that's just me.

240
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,170
Clare?

241
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,505
Oh f...

242
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,588
No.

243
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,173
What?

244
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,593
I just sent a crying reaction.

245
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,303
- To... to Tess?
- To Tess.

246
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,473
Okay, fine, you DMed her.
That's good. This is a good thing.

247
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,600
Just say it was an accident
at the bonfire tonight.

248
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:16,021
Are you gonna be next to me
while I have to suffer and do this?

249
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:20,192
I'm at the mercy of Aidan tonight,
but, um, we'll see. I'll try.

250
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:24,029
Speaking of, he should be here,
like, any minute now.

251
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,741
- Okay.
- You need help.

252
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,536
- It's okay to ask.
- I don't need help.

253
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,454
- You do need help.
- Look, it's going.

254
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,956
Look at that.

255
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:37,167
Something ugly's in here that's asking
to not be brought to college.

256
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,545
- That's what's happening.
- Probably the whole bag.

257
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,797
But don't worry about it.

258
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,884
All right, well, um,
call me if you need backup.

259
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:52,266
You, uh... sure you're ready for this?

260
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:55,477
Yeah. Yeah, no, for sure.

261
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,981
It's obviously not gonna be
the easiest night in the world,

262
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,274
but it's a good goodbye.

263
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,071
- Lilies.
- Hi.

264
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,741
- Good choice.
- It's the flower of funerals.

265
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:09,658
I like it.

266
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,375
- You ready?
- Final date.

267
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,045
- Whoa.
- Ah, damn it.

268
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,296
Oh, Mom.

269
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,381
- Hey.
- Hey there.

270
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,217
My folks are right behind me.

271
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,461
Good to see you. Let me help.

272
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,805
I mean, we were all ready,
minus the chaos.

273
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,641
Let's get this up.

274
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,226
We're gonna be lost without you.

275
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,189
You kids break up yet?

276
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,733
- Hi.
- How are you?

277
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,781
- You know everyone thinks you're idiots?
- Of course.

278
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,074
- Hi.
- Hi.

279
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,993
- My favorite sister.
- Oh, my only brother.

280
00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,625
Okay, here we go.

281
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,011
While no parent loves their teen dating,

282
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,932
Clare did manage to find
the one thoughtful high-school boy.

283
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:16,350
I did.

284
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:19,186
And even though
she's letting him get away,

285
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,607
Aidan, I loved
having you in our family this year.

286
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,568
And, Clare Bear,

287
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,823
God knows things
have not always been easy for us,

288
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,117
but somehow, you have managed

289
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,286
to grow into this brilliant,

290
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:40,290
caring, and determined young woman.

291
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:46,672
I'll kill you if you're late
for our 7:00 a.m. departure, so...

292
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:50,092
Okay, we know it'll be me
dragging you out of bed in the morning.

293
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,176
Ooh!

294
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,262
- Okay. Yeah, maybe.
- It's true.

295
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,973
Okay. To Clare.

296
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,683
- Yes.
- To Clare.

297
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:58,766
Clare.

298
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:00,476
Steve.

299
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,646
I... I wanna thank you

300
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,941
for letting me into your life.

301
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,943
I mean, who would've thought

302
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:12,656
that a year after getting kicked off
the city council, I'd be living in a house

303
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:16,618
with a beautiful,
intelligent, capable woman

304
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:20,039
and sending a pseudo stepdaughter
off to college.

305
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,040
Not me.

306
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,167
Clare, most importantly,

307
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,462
do not get mono in college.

308
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,172
Steve! He's not wrong.

309
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:31,633
- It spreads like wildfire, guys.
- He knows what I'm talking about.

310
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:32,885
Cheers.

311
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,928
This is why
we didn't need to do the toast.

312
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,014
- To Clare and Aidan.
- Okay.

313
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,226
- So, Clare.
- Yes.

314
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,395
- Poli-sci at Dartmouth.
- Mm-hmm.

315
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,522
- That's amazing. So cool.
- I'm excited.

316
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,441
And Aidan is pre-med.

317
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,943
- I thought you'd do something with music.
- Oh...

318
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:53,238
No, Mr. Perfect over here
is gonna follow in their footsteps.

319
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,699
Yep. Cardiologist, like his old man.

320
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:56,867
Excuse me.

321
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,828
He's gonna be a radiologist,
just like his mama.

322
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,080
Well...

323
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,085
- I think we have places to be.
- Yeah.

324
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:08,670
We should, uh... we should get going.

325
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,672
It's a lot on the itinerary.

326
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:11,882
Itinerary?

327
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,111
- Bungee jumping?
- Yes.

328
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,498
We're going to buy a dog?

329
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:20,015
I've been really patient.
You need to tell me what's going on.

330
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,768
You texted me 13 times
asking me what we were doing.

331
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,061
It was me holding back.

332
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:27,773
It is my epic date. It's my rules. Period.

333
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:31,610
Technically, the whole "go to college
single" thing was my idea, so...

334
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,445
Clare, do you trust me?

335
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,447
Yes, I trust you.

336
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:40,077
- Even though everyone thinks we're crazy.
- Oh, please.

337
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,454
They wish that they could end
a relationship this well.

338
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,915
We're like the anti-broken hearts club.

339
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:49,586
- Poster children of modern relationships.
- The king and queen of ending things.

340
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,390
I'm breaking up with you
because I love you.

341
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,468
Easy breezy.

345
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:07,603
Thank you.

346
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:11,024
I thought you said this was sold out.

347
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:14,736
Summersets is like a big deal.
How did you manage to pull this off?

348
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,448
- I, uh... have my ways.
- Okay.

349
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,659
This takes me back to our first date.

350
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,578
One, two. One.

351
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,164
Check. Check.

352
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,247
- One.
- Aidan.

353
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,543
Colette, thank you so much
for hooking us up.

354
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:32,421
I can't believe you hooked him up
after he bailed on your band.

355
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,423
- How dare he bail on us?
- Whoa.

356
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,092
I'm still mad at him
for not applying to Berklee.

357
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,094
I am too.  I told him.

358
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,471
But he just had to go pre-med.

359
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,766
- The golden boy has lives to save.
- Okay, I'm standing here.

360
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,518
- Yeah, we know.
- Yeah, we see you.

361
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,817
Have a good breakup or whatever this is.

362
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,569
Thank you.

363
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,323
Hey, we're Milk & Bone.

364
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,825
It's a first for us
to do a breakup shout-out,

365
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,369
but Clare and Aidan, here's to your song.

378
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,557
You didn't lie.

379
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:10,560

a pretty incredible first date.

385
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,258
Stella, hey.

386
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,636
So... you were right.

387
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,973
This is, like,
a lot harder than I thought.

388
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,309
<i>Wait, take a breath.
What's going on?</i>

389
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:55,564
Just... what if I'm throwing away, like,
the best thing that ever happened to me?

390
00:21:56,064 --> 00:22:01,028
But maybe I'm... I'm also just clinging
to that, 'cause Aidan's safe and easy.

391
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:05,157
But also it, like, wouldn't be easy at all
if we were long-distance.

392
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,076
Also, we're supposed to go off
and be our own people

393
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,203
and have our own experiences and...

394
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:15,000
That was the point of this whole pact
in the first place. Yep.

395
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,878
Know what? I'm being
really stupid right now. I'm sorry.

396
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:20,839
<i>- How we doing?</i>
- Great. Clare'll be out any second.

397
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:23,050
I wanted to make sure we're still good.

398
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,801
<i>Yeah, we're all set, man.</i>

399
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,137
This can't be the end.

400
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:28,757
We're making the right call.

401
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:31,266
Aidan knows it. I know it.
We're gonna have our last date,

402
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,769
and it's gonna be incredible,
and then that's it.

403
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:38,607
I feel like we can make it, and hopefully,
by the end of the night, she'll...

404
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,525
she'll feel that too.

405
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,621
Thank you...

406
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,540
for everything.

407
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:05,300
You don't want to be
the douchey guitar guy in your dorm.

408
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,677
Bring, like, a keyboard or something.

409
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:11,598
You think my dad is gonna let me haul
a whole-ass keyboard to school?

410
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,850
I mean, he's not the grandma from<i> Coco.</i>

411
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,269
I don't know. Music's allowed at college.

412
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,562
I don't know, you say that,

413
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:20,232
but he's downloaded
an eight-part cardiology lecture

414
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:21,149
for the trip.

415
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,776
- Rough.
- I'm dead serious.

416
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:27,114
Well, at least your parents can road trip
without killing each other.

417
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,616
Once, mine fought so bad
that, I kid you not,

418
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:31,535
my mom made us stop
on the Golden Gate Bridge

419
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,120
so she could get out and walk.

420
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,955
No. No, no, no.

421
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,249
Hockey?

422
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,793
What gave it away?

423
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:42,462
- I've no idea.
- Like the hockey rink?

424
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,047
Wait, okay, what are we doing?

425
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,883
What're we doing?
Tell me what we're doing.

426
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,969
- You got an hour.
- Thanks, Rhoda.

427
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:50,720
Thanks, Rhoda.

428
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,056
Who's Rhoda?

429
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,059
Oh m...

430
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,481
- The whole place?
- Oh, all of it.

431
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:07,028
- You're impressed, right?
- I... I... I'm speechless.

432
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,739
Just take it all in.
No, just take it all in.

433
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,534
Everything that the light touches

434
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:15,829
is all ours for the next hour.

435
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,205
Whoo!

436
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,086
Okay.

437
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,465
Tonight, we are reliving our firsts.

438
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,801
All right?
We've already gone on our first date,

439
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:33,180
and now we return
to our first hockey game.

440
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,725
Okay, but that hockey game
was our first fight.

441
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:41,188
I don't know why we need to memorialize
our first fight on our last date.

442
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,482
A first fight is momentous.

443
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:44,983
It's a moment of growth.

444
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:48,695
That is such bull.

445
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,409
I don't know why
you just can't admit you farted.

446
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,578
I don't know why you're bringing this up.

447
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,079
Aidan and Clare?

448
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,289
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

449
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:01,833
This way.
The race's about to start in one minute.

450
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,252
You guys look good. Ba-boom!

451
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,339
Aidan, you can't say that you farted.

452
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:11,301
I announce it. Like, "Yo, I let one rip."
It's funnier if you do it like that.

453
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:14,304
You don't have to be perfect all the time.
Not with me.

454
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,806
Please turn your attention to center ice

455
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,851
for the intermission race around the rink.

456
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,230
We've got the hot dog and the popcorn.

457
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:25,565
We've got the mustard and the ketchup.

458
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:29,319
"Sorry, I let one rip. My fault."
It's not a big deal. Admit the truth.

459
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:31,988
I didn't fart. I don't know
what else you want me to say.

460
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:35,575
I was in the car with you.
Okay, so is it disgusting if I fart?

461
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:38,036
You can fart if you wanna fart.
Everybody farts.

462
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,956
I'll hold it in.
Whenever I'm around you, I'll never fart.

463
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,958
You have my word. Oops, I just farted.

464
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,709
- Let me just move.
- Three!

465
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,854
- But that's what you're acting like.
- Two!

466
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,005
- One!
- Team Hot Dog, baby! Team Hot Dog!

467
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,089
Go!

468
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:53,152
- You can't admit it.
- Can we just focus on the race?

469
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:54,886
You were so excited two minutes ago.

470
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,739
- I'm over it.
- It's for Ellie's Deli.

471
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,306
I'm over it. I gotta go.

472
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,850
Are you actually leaving
'cause you think I let one rip?

473
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,812
I'm leaving because
you don't trust me enough to admit it.

474
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:09,693
I do think we owe it to ourselves
to finally win not only one

475
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,611
but two pastries...

476
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:12,612
Oh my God.

477
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,382
...from Ellie's Deli. What're you... No, no.

478
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,824
Are you... Excuse me?

479
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:19,661
Oh, no, no. You gotta win these bad boys.
We gotta right this wrong.

480
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:21,161
What are...

481
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,042
What are you doing?

482
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,130
Okay.

483
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,048
It's on.

484
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,261
Booyah!

485
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,430
- No, no, no, no, no.
- One, two, three.

486
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,849
Ready? We'll play nice and fair.

487
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:44,686
- You won't play fair.
- I'm a fair... I'm a fair player.

488
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:49,232
You ready? Three, two, one, go.

00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:53,630
That might be the most romantic thing
you've ever said to me.

507
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,384
Hour's up, lovebirds.

508
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,343
Let's go!

509
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:02,847
- I wanna watch<i> Shark Tank.</i>
- Thanks, Rhoda.

510
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:04,765
Thank you.

511
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,852
This has all been so perfect.

512
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:20,323
Whoo!

513
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:25,120
First time you kept
outdoing yourself on a date?

514
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:39,259
Oh, first time we went waterskiing?

515
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:42,429
No, think, um... think more sentimental.

516
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:44,723
More meaningful to us as a couple.

517
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,350
If I can find it.

518
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,435
Here it is.

519
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:50,979
Maybe this'll jog your memory.

520
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,649
The first time you ever
proposed to me on a boat.

521
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,234
- Oh, you wish.
- Aw.

522
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:57,944
No, open that.

523
00:28:58,528 --> 00:28:59,528
Thank you.

524
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,745
It's a rocket.

525
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,163
Flip it over.

526
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,381
Easy breezy.

527
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:21,092
Hey! Slow down, Scotty!

528
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,136
No, I wanna get off! No, no, no!

529
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:31,894
Yes!

530
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,190
It's good. I got you.

531
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,942
- Easy breezy.
- Easy breezy?

532
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,027
Easy breezy.

533
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,905
Easy bre... easy breezy.

534
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,244
Here we go!

535
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,746
Yeah!

536
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:54,125
Let's go! In three...

537
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,335
Scotty!

538
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:57,128
...two...

539
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:00,340
Here we go!

540
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:01,257
Scotty!

541
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,058
Clare! Scotty, pull around.

542
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,852
Where the hell did she go?

543
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:14,728
Clare!

544
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:18,107
- Clare!
- I'm over here.

545
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,526
Clare, Clare, you're good.

546
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,152
That's what I like to see.

547
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,571
Okay, okay, I got you.

548
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:24,655
Aidan.

549
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,574
I got you.

550
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:29,911
I got you. I got you.

551
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:31,830
Come here.

552
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:34,541
Yes!

553
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:37,502
Yes! Yes!

554
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:38,419
Hey.

555
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,423
Oh my God

556
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,009
I love you.

557
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,845
That was not easy.

558
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,059
What did you say?

559
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:54,726
I love you.

560
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:57,605
Easy breezy.

561
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:01,316
Okay.

562
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:04,988
You got rocketed!

563
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:07,574
You got rocketed, Clare!

564
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,367
- Let's go.
- Whoo!

565
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:21,212
The first "I love you."

566
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,258
This was definitely worth the trip.

567
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,763
Clare, um...

568
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:34,350
I know we made a deal.

569
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,476
We don't...

570
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:45,904
I wanted to know what it was like
to be launched into the air.

571
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:48,740
- I mean, you were flying.
- Stop. Enough.

572
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:52,076
- It was crazy though, right?
- I mean, it was crazy.

573
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,202
I made that work.

574
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:56,289
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

575
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,082
- Pizza? All right, let's go.
- Mm-hmm.

576
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:04,464
<i>♪ In the end, it ain't the end ♪</i>

577
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:06,925
<i>♪ It just goes on and on again ♪</i>

578
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,514
<i>♪ And all the people that you meet ♪</i>

579
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,142
<i>♪ Are just the same as you and me ♪</i>

580
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:21,772
Wow.

581
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:24,192
First Valentine's Day.

582
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:34,369
Okay, just, um...
just chill here. Wait for me.

583
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:35,452
Will do.

584
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,877
You need to be
shutting this down, immediately.

585
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:28,965
You can put me facedown all you want,
but you can't avoid this.

586
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:32,802
- Okay, well, I just texted Stella...
- Uh-uh.

587
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:35,263
- This is about you and Aidan.
- He's still my boyfriend.

588
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,015
Yeah, he's still her boyfriend.

589
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:38,975
Her Valentine.

590
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,602
No, no, no, no, no. One is enough.

591
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,438
- Hi.
- Hi.

592
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:47,817
He'll hold you back from becoming
the woman you were meant to be.

593
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,236
Or... or he'll be
your biggest supporter along the way.

594
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:52,155
- Doubtful.
- Guys, I have a plan.

595
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:54,532
And I'm gonna...
I'm gonna stick to that plan.

596
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:57,994
You can't fault someone for loving
big, romantic gestures. It's kinda cute.

597
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:00,997
You can't fault someone
for wanting to do their own thing.

598
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,249
You wanna move forward
from your true love?

599
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:05,626
- We are too young to know.
- Okay.

600
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,712
Thank you, but this is more than enough.

601
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:10,673
I'm getting a little anxious right now,
so let's stop.

602
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,426
- Don't wanna mess this up.
- No, look at me.

603
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:15,887
You give an inch,
and you can lose your whole future.

604
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,639
- You wanna move away...
- We need to stay strong.

605
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,059
I'm trying to. Wow.

606
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,477
It's okay. I'm here.

607
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,397
Okay, and so is James Bond.

608
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,109
You called Stella?

609
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,778
You're wearing a tux?

610
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:34,155
We never got a prom.

611
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,532
It's our next stop.

612
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:40,661
Stella. What's up?

613
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:45,708
- It's a... it's a big energy shift.
- Yeah.

614
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,461
- I told you guys it was good.
- I like it.

615
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:50,296
Come on.

616
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:52,673
That's adorable.

617
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:55,277
- This is a production.
- Planning the night for a while.

618
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:58,179
- You stud.
- I'm gonna miss this.

619
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:01,891
- Miss what?
- Us just, I don't know, all hanging out.

620
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:02,974
I mean...

621
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:06,104
- Not to be sappy or anything, but...
- Uh-huh.

622
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:09,941
Okay, stop. I never thought
I'd have a group of friends like this.

623
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,360
'Cause you did
nothing but school.

624
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,861
Ow-wah!

625
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,948
No. Well, like, a little bit.
But because I, like...

626
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:18,407
I moved around so much.

627
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:23,496
And, I don't know, it's our last night
before we all go off to our new lives.

628
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:28,417
Aidan and I are celebrating our firsts,
but how often do you know that

629
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:32,130
this is, like, the last time of something?

630
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,297
Damn.

631
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:39,137
For real. I got suspended
before I even got to tag the senior wall.

632
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,013
Never got to leave my mark.

633
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:44,767
I'm pretty sure you did that
when you streaked at the soccer game.

634
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:48,437
Well... well, yeah. I mean,
you know I like to show my school spirit.

635
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:51,524
Everybody saw your ding-dong, my guy.

636
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:54,986
- Aight, uh, this has been a blast.
- But I'm saying...

637
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,529
- Okay.
- This has been a blast.

638
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:58,132
You guys are awesome. I love you both.

639
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:00,199
- But Clare and I...
- We should go tag it.

640
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,117
What?

641
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:07,582
I think you should tag the wall.
We have time, right, Aid?

642
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,960
Yeah, I mean,
it's kind of a full night planned.

643
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:14,630
I know, I know, but it's our last night
as a group together too.

644
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,757
And Scotty, Scotty needs to make his mark.

645
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,217
Absolutely.

646
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,981
We can't leave him hanging like that.
We can't let him be forgotten.

647
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:23,347
No, we don't want him to be forgotten.

648
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,934
- Don't you have to work tonight?
- Dude, I got off like an hour ago.

649
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:30,229
Aidan, it's just one stop,
and we get back to our night.

650
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:31,522
For Scotty.

651
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:32,732
Break into the school?

652
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:34,650
And also there's...

653
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:36,861
My...

654
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:40,072
- Your character shoes.
- Character shoes.

655
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,741
- Your what?
- Character shoes.

656
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:43,719
- In your locker.
- In my locker.

657
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,703
Let's go. Let's go tag the wall.

658
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:46,786
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

659
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:49,457
Let's go tag that wall
and save Stella's character.

660
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,700
- Yes.
- Close enough.

661
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,668
This is gonna be really fun.
Am I crazy?

662
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,128
- Aidan? Dude?
- Come on.

663
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,254
Let's go.

664
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:56,464
Aidan.

665
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:59,342
- It's gonna be fun.
- Come on.

666
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:00,885
- Please?
- Come on.

667
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:01,969
Come on.

668
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,640
- I mean, I guess it is our only...
- Come on! Wow!

669
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,350
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

670
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,560
- Yeah.
- Okay, okay, okay.

671
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,604
- To the school.
- Party bus!

672
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:13,814
- To the school.
- Oh yes!

673
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,910
<i>♪ This is me all day, all week
No, they can't say what I can't be ♪</i>

674
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,664
<i>♪ This is me all day, all week
No, they can't say what I can't be ♪</i>

675
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:33,668
<i>♪ This is me all day, all week
'Cause they ain't got nothin' on me ♪</i>

676
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,213
Quite a vibe, huh?

677
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:45,513
If I spent a lot of money
to rent a party bus,

678
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,056
this is how I'd be behaving.

684
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,534
Aidan, what about you?

<i>♪ This is me all day, all week

692
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,649
Yo!

693
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,194
So there's no plan at all?

694
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:44,613
Here we go.

695
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:49,869
That's all I got.

696
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:52,121
Okay, follow me. Follow me.

697
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:53,289
I know what to do.

698
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:56,375
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Be quiet, man.

699
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:59,670
- Trying to get us in trouble.
- I know people who've done this before.

700
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,941
- You're breaking and entering.
- I'm not breaking and entering.

701
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:06,260
So technically, this is the only door
in the school that doesn't fully lock.

702
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:10,014
I know 'cause of fire safety checks.
Whatever. Watch this. You go like...

703
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:14,393
What the... Okay, Clare,
you legit just made me a feminist.

704
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,604
- Well-done.
- A lot better than my attempt.

705
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,248
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

706
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:21,359
- Student Council paid off. Maybe not.
- Football. Aidan, go long.

707
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,736
- Nope, took too long.
- I don't like this.

708
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:27,073
- Scotty, why? Why would you do that?
- Okay.

709
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:29,533
Okay, you and me,
we're gonna go to the art room

710
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:32,119
and get our paint for the hands.
You guys, character shoes?

711
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,204
- Meet back here?
- Yeah.

712
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:34,997
- Let's go. Ready?
- Wait, what?

713
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:37,249
- Oh. Okay.
- Scotty, we're out, okay?

714
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,853
- Pick up your feet, guys. Let's go.
- All right. All right. Okay.

715
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:40,877
Okay.

716
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,511
Nothing like the theater, I tell ya.

717
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:54,308
Well, okay,
time to find my character shoes.

718
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,853
- Which are in my locker.
- Stella, you can drop the act.

719
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:02,108
Yeah, we cleared these out in May,

720
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:05,152
and honestly, I've never owned
a pair of character shoes.

721
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:10,074
I mostly work on set stuff,
but you knew that.

722
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,163
You know, we should be recreating
our prom night right now.

723
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:23,087
You know,
when Clare got sick before the prom,

724
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:27,174
she was actually relieved
she didn't have to go.

725
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,468
Stella, you know good and well

726
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,762
that she would've had a great time
if we would've gone.

727
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,723
I actually don't think I know that.

728
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:37,601
You can't control
everything, Aidan.

729
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:41,397
You can't...
"Aidan" your way out of situations.

730
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,815
Aidan my way out of situ...

731
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:45,127
- What in the world... Please tell me what...
- You know what...

732
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,610
I think you know what I mean.

733
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:49,131
I have no clue. You used my name
as a verb. What does it mean?

734
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:53,993
Positively, when one,

735
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:57,788
an Aidan for example,
behaves in a sort of manner

736
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:01,625
where, you know, you sort of...

737
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:04,378
You know?
And then things kind of go your way.

738
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:06,714
I'm just saying,

739
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:10,593
you both set the rules at the start.

740
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:13,053
You can't be upset
if she doesn't wanna break them.

741
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,763
There's no way we could've known

742
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,927
it would've turned out
to be as good as it is though.

743
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,100
It's good.

744
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:21,020
Yes, you guys are my favorite couple.
I'm obsessed with you.

745
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:22,521
So you think I should keep trying?

746
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:27,568
You just need to be honest with her.

747
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:32,615
Just... be real with each other.

748
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,702
And then when you're done with that...

749
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:41,707
hope for the best, my light-skinned king.

750
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,172
Thank you. Yeah.

751
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:49,255
Okay.

752
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,425
I feel like mixing black...

753
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,178
- Wow, that's a lot.
- Just gotta get the right color.

754
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:55,930
You did just mix black paint...

755
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:00,935
Now, can you check
that there's blue, please?

756
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,645
Or purple, for that matter?

757
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,522
Thank you.

758
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,150
You need to hurry up
because they're waiting.

759
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:11,278
What's the rush? I thought you'd be happy

760
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,781
about avoiding your relationship
a little longer.

761
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:17,576
- No, I... wasn't.
- I'm messing.

762
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:19,912
Sort of. Kind of.

763
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:22,705
Not really.

764
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:29,213
This isn't working.

765
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:31,590
I know.

766
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:34,301
I just wish Aidan would see that too.

767
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:37,346
I was talking about the paints.

768
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,058
Right, the paints.

769
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:44,228
Do you wanna just go
with a... a solid color?

770
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,230
Not whatever that is.

771
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:48,691
Let's... let's go with red.

772
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,408
Dude, tonight just wasn't the clean break
I was hoping it would be.

773
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:59,910
Please, Clare,
it was always gonna be messy.

774
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,120
And you know it.

775
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:03,914
I don't know, maybe if Aidan were
more excited about school,

776
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:07,293
or if he ended up
deciding to, you know, like...

777
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:08,544
Go to Berklee?

778
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,254
Yeah.

779
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,173
I've heard that.

780
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:17,136
You know, he's just so talented,
and I know his parents think

781
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:20,306
it's a huge risk or whatever
to pursue that, but I don't know.

782
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:23,934
I don't know if it would end up actually
being that much of a risk with him.

783
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:28,229
Well,

784
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:32,401
I don't think Aidan thinks
it'd be much of a risk with you.

785
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:50,544
Oh, there she is.

786
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,297
In the flesh.

787
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:57,635
My Everest.

788
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:01,221
What color you going with?

789
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:03,974
Red. The color of war.

790
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:07,353
Disturbing.

791
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:13,067
- Scotty! Scotty!
- Oh, yeah.

792
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,361
Ready for the Senior Week suspension.

793
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:17,446
Scotty! Scotty!

794
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:18,530
Scotty!

795
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:19,614
Ooh!

796
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:22,034
- Scotty!
- Yo!

797
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:25,287
Okay, a bold choice.

798
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:28,582
- But we'll take it though.
- There's so much paint and no towel.

799
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,584
- Okay, well...
- Well, thank you.

800
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:33,462
What you gonna do?
Wipe it on my jacket? Who raised you?

801
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:35,297
- Go to the bathroom.
- Okay.

802
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:38,008
- Why would I voluntarily...
- I don't know.

803
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:41,136
- That is barely a handprint.
- Yeah.

804
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:48,060
How many couple prints
you think actually last?

805
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:52,939
I don't know.

806
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,736
Jade and Marcus already broke up.

807
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:03,242
Stella said she hooked up with some guy
at MSU before school even started.

808
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:06,120
Wow.

809
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,414
Didn't even last a month.

810
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:11,769
Is that what you're afraid of?

811
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,384
I don't know, Aidan. I just...

812
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:25,180
I wanna give ourselves
the chance to be our own people.

813
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:27,975
Don't you just wanna be able
to jump into any situation

814
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:31,019
and not have to give it
a second thought, you know?

815
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:32,813
I want that, and I want that for you too.

816
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:36,066
It's one of those things
I've always had in the back of my mind.

817
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:40,362
And I'm sorry if that sounds selfish,
but that's always been my plan...

818
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:43,657
For two seconds, forget...
forget about your plan.

819
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:46,785
Okay? What... what do you want?

820
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:55,626
Aidan...

821
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,009
I may have triggered the alarm.

822
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:04,928
He definitely did.
It's the one that's ringing right now.

823
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:07,181
It really doesn't matter.
Just run.

00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:11,018

- Where's the bus?
- Go, go, go, go!

830
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,119
Come on, come on!
Come on, come on!

831
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:33,415
Think someone's
actually chasing us?

832
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:35,876
To safety.

833
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:38,504
Here. I got you.

834
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:47,137
- Come on.
- Dude, hurry.

835
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:49,430
Come on!

836
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,687
- Oh shit.
- Oh my God, are...

837
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:57,523
Oh my God. Are you okay?

838
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,858
- I'm good. Yeah.
- You're okay? Okay.

839
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:00,776
Oh God.

840
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:02,444
Oh no.

841
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:03,403
No.

842
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,113
Stella, no, no, no.

843
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:07,157
- Stella, no.
- Should I call the driver?

844
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:10,160
Hold up, hold up.

845
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,580
- You feel okay? Okay.
- I'm good.

846
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:18,168
Just one more stitch here.

847
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,784
How's our patient doing?

848
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,704
I'm all right, Mom.
I already told you, I'm good.

849
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:56,373
Well, you're lucky it's me on call
and not your dad.

850
00:47:57,499 --> 00:48:00,377
You know, Dr. Olsen,
my son is gonna be pre-med this fall.

851
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,462
- Is he now?
- Mm-hmm.

852
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:06,967
He'll be just a short drive from Clare.
She's off to Dartmouth in the morning.

853
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:08,886
Bright and early.

854
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:13,431
Oh.

855
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:14,600
- That was good.
- Yeah.

856
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,520
Ooh!

857
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:20,856
- Come on. Yeah.
- I mean, you know?

858
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:24,484
What's your plan? Like, after school...

859
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:26,570
- I got a houseboat.
- You got a houseboat?

860
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:29,281
Yeah, well, I'm gonna have a houseboat.
That's my plan.

861
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:30,633
- Okay.
- What about you?

862
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:33,035
- You're going to college, right?
- Yeah.

863
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:35,996
Is that...

864
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,119
- Meeting new people.
- That is what it is.

865
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:39,791
That stuff takes time, you know?

866
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:44,296
It takes people actually, like, being, uh,

867
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:46,590
interested in you, maybe?

868
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:48,050
I was interested in you.

869
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:51,887
- Sorry.
- I had a really big crush on you.

870
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:53,847
- Yeah, in seventh grade.
- Huh.

871
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:56,850
On the bus back from Lansing.
I brought mints on it,

872
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:59,186
'cause I was gonna make out with you.

873
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:00,979
The mints are a nice touch.

874
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:02,940
If there's one thing I know,

875
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:05,233
you gotta be bold.

876
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:08,445
Be bold.

877
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:11,782
Tell me more about what women want.

878
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:13,992
I'm telling you,
it's gonna get you places.

879
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:15,243
Like a houseboat?

880
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:19,873
So, your last stop is a bonfire?

881
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:21,582
Sort of.

882
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,545
It... The beach was supposed to be
just the two of us,

883
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,881
but the night's taken a few turns.

884
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:31,885
Ah. Well, if I were a better parent,
I'd make you both go home right now.

885
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,887
Oh, thank God you're so terrible then.

886
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:34,846
Ah.

887
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:35,931
We'll be okay.

888
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:38,016
- Mmm.
- He's alive.

889
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:41,103
Ooh, let's see those stitches. Mmm.

890
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:45,649
This is gonna be the last time I see you.

891
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:49,236
- Clare, you're gonna do great things.
- Thank you.

892
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:52,823
And if you ever change your mind,
he won't be too far away.

893
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:56,952
When he didn't get into Berklee,
he was at least excited about that.

894
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:01,081
Oh, sorry, I... I thought

895
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:03,917
that, um, he wasn't allowed
to apply to music school.

896
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:06,003
Oh, honey, no. Uh...

897
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:08,338
He didn't get in.

898
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:12,843
Aidan didn't tell you.

899
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,012
Um...

900
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:18,140
No, he didn't.

901
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:22,102
But it was good to see you.

902
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:24,729
You too.

- So you were in the hospital?
- Relax.

913
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:15,947
I'm good. I promise.

914
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:18,075
Uh, we're gonna meet you guys over here.

915
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:20,911
We patched him up really good, though.
Really good.

916
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,501
Dude, I'm sorry
I dragged you into all this.

917
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:29,544
It's a lot.

918
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:31,755
Yeah,
sort of like my whole night.

919
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:33,673
But I am willing to excuse it

920
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:36,802
on the grounds of you being
in the midst of the most

921
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:41,014
complicated breakup of maybe all time.

922
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:43,307
You didn't lie.

923
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,149
But thank you.

924
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,109
Like, for real.

925
00:51:57,155 --> 00:52:00,617
You know, this is, like,
our last night together too.

926
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:02,202
I know.

927
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:07,457
Mmm.

928
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:13,338
Aidan is not the only one
who can do a big gesture, okay?

929
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:14,256
Okay.

930
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:18,969
- I... I've been planning for months, and I...
- Don't joke about that.

931
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:21,638
I present you this pine cone...

932
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:23,056
Oh.

933
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,474
...which represents...

934
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:25,433
Mmm.

935
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:27,853
...how I felt when... when you moved.

936
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:31,148
All sappy inside.

937
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:32,149
Sappy.

938
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,275
I give you this.

939
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:37,946
- Cheers, bitch.
- Cheers.

940
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:41,449
And may this pine cone
burn like our friendship.

941
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:46,204
- I don't know, I can be sentimental.
- Is that sentimental?

942
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:48,081
- Yeah.
- You put a hex on me.

943
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:50,750
- That's not a hex.
- That's a bad omen.

944
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:53,670
I'm saying, like,
our friendship is like heat. It's like...

945
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:56,006
Okay, for sure.

946
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:59,342
No, I got there. I got there.
No, but you know what's heat though?

947
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:01,303
This seaweed.

948
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:03,096
- Oh no, it's a sock.
- That's nasty.

949
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:05,640
Oh!

950
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,518
It's a sock.

951
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:11,354
Did you just throw a sock at me?

952
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:12,438
Mmm.

953
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:15,942
Tess. Uh, that was... that was an accident.

954
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:18,028
We were, like, doing, like, a bit thing.

955
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:21,907
Uh, 'cause here I thought
the sock and the crying emoji

956
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:24,159
were you acting out
'cause summer's ending.

957
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:28,079
Uh, yeah, no, for sure. Yeah.

958
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:30,749
Some people have love languages.
I have a grief language,

959
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:34,794
where I throw debris
and send random emojis.

960
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:39,382
Yeah, a few of us are heading up the beach
to Ladarian's house, if you wanna come?

961
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:41,676
- We kind of like...
- That would be so cool.

962
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,678
- We'd love to come.
- Cool.

963
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:47,265
- Uh, yes, that is cool with me.
- I'll meet you guys in a sec.

964
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:51,061
- Hey. Do you...
- Yeah, let's...

965
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:52,144
Yeah.

966
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:57,317
For the record, um, the beach was all part
of the date night anyway.

967
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,069
We're just hitting it kinda late.

968
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:03,573
Uh, yes. I assumed you wanted us
to relive the senior swim out to Rusty.

969
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:06,076
Yeah, had to happen at some point.

970
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:10,455
I mean, you kind of bailed
on the whole graduation race thing.

971
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:13,625
Yeah, well, the water was freezing and...

972
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:17,045
I... I just don't understand the tradition
of swimming out to a buoy.

973
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:19,047
I know, it's stupid.

974
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:20,048
No, it's...

975
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:22,592
But Rusty is still bobbing out there,

976
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,761
and it's waiting for us.

977
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:31,559
Aidan, your mom told me about Berklee.

978
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:37,065
- Whoa. What?
- Why would you have kept that from me?

979
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:41,987
Clare, I'm... It's not...
There was nothing to talk about.

980
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:45,490
- Not a big deal.
- All I've ever been is honest with you.

981
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:46,783
Clare, it... it... it...

982
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:52,622
I don't... I don't know
what you want me to say.

983
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:57,002
I just thought tonight
was about saying goodbye.

984
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:00,297
Or is that just another lie too?

985
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:14,060
It's dare.

986
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:16,104
Truth bomb.

987
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:17,939
- What do you wanna know?
- Dare, baby.

988
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:20,567

that nobody knows about you.

1000
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:03,318
Secret. Hmm.

1001
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,905
Well, I don't know if it's a secret,

1002
00:56:06,988 --> 00:56:10,784
but the truth is that...

1003
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:16,956
I wish you would've dared her to kiss me.

00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,877

1016
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:24,816
<i>You were my friend Allie's
prospective student. What're you studying?</i>

1017
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:26,693
Uh, poli-sci.

1018
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:30,405
Okay. Whatever you do, avoid
Professor Holmes for political theory.

1019
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:36,327
You going?

1020
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:38,036
Where?

1021
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:42,375
- To Dartmouth?
- Oh. Yes. Yes.

1022
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,586
Yeah, I'm, like,
actually leaving tomorrow.

1023
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:57,639
What's up?

1024
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:05,857
Oh, it's so good.

1025
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:07,734
Hey, what up, my man?

1026
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:12,280
Uh, sorry, have you... have you seen Clare?

1027
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:14,866
No, I... I haven't.

1028
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:15,949
Are you good?

1029
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:23,124
Cool, no, yeah.
You don't have to answer. It's all good.

1030
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:25,584
I'm good. I'm fine.

1031
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:26,711
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1032
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:29,047
You seem fine.

1033
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:32,383
- I'm good. Yes. No, we're good.
- You sure?

1034
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:33,468
We're gonna be good.

1035
00:58:34,093 --> 00:58:37,222
You don't seem good.

Yo! Yo, yo, can we, um...
can we cut the music real quick?

1041
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:16,010
What's up, guys? How we doing?

1042
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:19,013
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's been a cool night, right?

1043
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:21,266
- Oh, he's standing on a table.
- Yeah.

1044
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:24,727
It's uh... it's been a year, man.

1045
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:28,439
And it's just weird,
thinking about, like, moving on

1046
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:31,818
and growing and... and all that stuff.

1047
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:34,988
And, you know, you... you meet people,

1048
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:38,491
and you hope that you have them
for a long time. It's crazy.

1049
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:43,162
Some of us might see each other
in college, and some of us might not.

1050
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:46,624
And the good parts,
I don't really want to end.

1051
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:49,752
And I'm sure we all feel the same way.

1052
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:53,339
Either way, it's the end of the year,
and it's the end of summer,

1053
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:55,800
and... and what's... what's the end

1054
00:59:55,883 --> 00:59:59,846
without bringing it back
to the beginning, right? So that said, um,

1055
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:02,599
I would love to invite Clare to come over.

1056
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:05,101
- Yeah.
- Whoo!

1057
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:11,941
Uh, it... it all started with a song,
if you guys remember, back at Halloween.

1058
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:17,655
What's up, everybody?

1059
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:19,866

Dude.

1064
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:01,615
Oh.

1065
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:05,119
It's not what it looks like.

1066
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:07,747
It looks like
you're kissing my sister right now.

1067
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:10,667
Well, yeah, you got me there.

1068
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:12,835
- Aidan...
- We kissed. It's not a big deal.

1069
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:13,919
You guys kissed?

1070
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:18,216
I don't... I don't know what to say
about any of this.

1071
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:21,177
About any of this, actually.

1072
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:23,512
Wow.

1073
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:25,515
We're gonna leave.

1074
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:27,517
Yeah, um...

1075
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,317
I don't know what the hell
that was back there.

1076
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:40,697
Oh, it's just... it's me
trying to do some... anything to save us.

1077
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:43,366
I'm sorry that you put
an impossible expectation on the night.

1078
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:45,660
- That's not my fault.
- Impossible expectation?

1079
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:48,454
Clare, we... we made a ridiculous joke pact,

1080
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:51,040
and you somehow
turned it into a binding agreement.

1081
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:54,836
It wasn't a joke. I know you think it was,
but I was very serious

1082
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:57,672
when I said I wasn't going
to college in a relationship.

1083
01:01:57,755 --> 01:02:01,634
That was before we fell for each other.
That's... Sometimes things change.

1084
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:05,054
Eventually, the prologue
turns into the book, Clare.

1085
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:06,818
Right, because we're the ones who make it.

1086
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:09,034
We're gonna feel the same way
for the rest of our lives.

1087
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:10,685
We're not gonna hurt each other.

1088
01:02:10,768 --> 01:02:13,938
It's already starting.
We can't do this the rest of our lives.

1089
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:16,482
Oh my God,
you should be studied for your ability

1090
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:18,568
to see the worst possible outcome.

1091
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:20,361
Aidan, but that's... Aidan!

1092
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:23,865
That's not the worst possible outcome.
That's the most realistic one.

1093
01:02:23,948 --> 01:02:26,576
I'm sorry you can't be real,
but I kept it real with you,

1094
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:28,494
and you couldn't even tell me
about Berklee.

1095
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:31,330
What do you want me
to say about Berklee?

1096
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:34,876
My parents finally let me apply,
I went to the audition and bombed it?

1097
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:37,837
It was the most humiliating thing
I've ever experienced?

1098
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,465
- There. There you go. There's Berklee.
- Oh my God.

1099
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:44,719
Oh my God, Aidan, it's... it's the fart.

1100
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:47,847
- It's always the fart.
- What are you talking about?

1101
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:51,225
You have this impossible expectation
to be perfect all the time.

1102
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:52,685
It's bleeding into everything.

1103
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:54,771
- I'm not trying to be perfect.
- Yes, you are.

1104
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:58,524
Berklee's not the only program.
There's hundreds of other programs.

1105
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:02,028
You know what? Maybe if you told me
and let me in, I could've helped.

1106
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:04,322
- But it's too late.
- No, no, you're right.

1107
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:07,575
You're right. Is there a world
where I wish I could say screw it

1108
01:03:07,658 --> 01:03:10,578
and go to LA or New York
and try to make it work

1109
01:03:10,661 --> 01:03:13,164
and most likely fail doing so? Yeah, 100%.

1110
01:03:13,247 --> 01:03:15,374
And you say I'm unrealistic

1111
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:19,212
when I'm going to school close to you
so we could try to make this work.

1112
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:22,024
Don't use that as an excuse.
It's not why you're going to that school.

1113
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:25,927
It's not an excuse when you believe in us.
It's not an excuse when I love you.

1114
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:29,847
And maybe you would feel the same way
if... if... if you could actually say it.

1115
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:37,021
- What are you talking about?
- Easy breezy. "I love you." "Easy breezy."

1116
01:03:37,104 --> 01:03:40,525
Do you have any idea how much it sucks
to tell someone you love them,

1117
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:43,444
and their response is "easy breezy."
What does it even mean?

1118
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:47,281
- You know exactly what it means.
- Just say it.

1119
01:03:55,873 --> 01:03:56,873
Just say it.

1120
01:04:03,631 --> 01:04:04,631
Yeah.

1121
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:08,928
So we're... we're done.

1122
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:12,931
Okay.

1123
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:44,505
Come on.

1124
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:55,558
Honey.

1125
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:03,691
I feel like I can't breathe or something.

1126
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:08,863
My heart's like beating out of my chest.

1127
01:05:11,198 --> 01:05:12,700
Okay, okay.

1128
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:26,464
I know that you wanted it
to be painless between you and Aidan,

1129
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:30,551
but that's... that's not how it works.

1130
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:32,553
Not when it's real.

1131
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:40,394
I just thought I was so careful.

1132
01:05:44,523 --> 01:05:45,566
You and Dad...

1133
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:50,154
you know, you committed so young and...

1134
01:05:50,738 --> 01:05:52,406
and fought until you broke.

1135
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:54,909
I just... I didn't wanna do that.

1136
01:05:57,995 --> 01:05:59,705
You were so unhappy, Mom.

1137
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:05,294
Well, I'm no expert at love,

1138
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:07,713
no need to tell you that,

1139
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:13,427
but there is one thing that I do know.

1140
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:15,513
And that's

1141
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:18,474
a relationship doesn't have a shot in hell

1142
01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:21,560
if you start planning its end
before it even starts.

1143
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:27,650
I just don't wanna lose myself.

1144
01:06:28,567 --> 01:06:31,362

I was afraid.

1172
01:08:57,383 --> 01:09:00,761
I was afraid of falling for you

1173
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:05,391
because I was worried that if I did,
I wouldn't be able to be on my own again.

1174
01:09:06,934 --> 01:09:08,734
I don't know.
I've moved around my whole life,

1175
01:09:08,769 --> 01:09:11,397
and I've always been
just so focused on the future

1176
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,482
and picturing what that was like.

1177
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:17,695
I never put much energy into the now.

1178
01:09:20,781 --> 01:09:22,199
Then I met you...

01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:31,667

on a beach giving you this speech,

01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:46,724
because I'm not afraid of that anymore.

1184
01:09:46,807 --> 01:09:50,019
And I wanna swim out to that buoy,
and I wanna finish this night,

1185
01:09:50,102 --> 01:09:53,022
and I wanna have our last first,
because I love you so much.

1186
