1
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:18,503
Give me something to eat.

2
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:31,506
Give me some food.

3
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:49,797
Why are you asleep? Wake up.

4
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:54,535
You will become wealthy.

5
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,405
Your children
will become healthy.

6
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:01,144
And they will study a lot.

7
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,044
You have got stuck at
this word. Continue.

8
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,843
You cannot even pronounce
the chants correctly.

9
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:49,046
Oh Priest, hurry up with
whatever you have to do.

10
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,655
We don't have time
for such minute details.

11
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,056
Your parents had a lot of
time to give birth to you.

12
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,526
To raise you! And you don't
have any time for them?

13
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:02,260
Look, when my father
expired, he was 50 years old.

14
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:05,435
If I keep chanting like you,
l' ll turn 50 years right here.

15
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:07,061
- Yes, l' ll turn 50
years old too. - Yes.

16
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,868
A person should do every
task with full dedication.

17
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,604
Or else, you won't
get the desired result.

18
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:16,273
Nowadays, even a priest
should complete his work fast.

19
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:17,873
Or else, you won't
get the desired fees.

20
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,451
Yes, you won't!

21
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,080
I cannot go to hell, just
for a little fees money.

22
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,086
- You go away from here!
- Why should we go?!

23
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,555
- Alright. Then l' ll go. - Go.

24
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,698
Even you are very stubborn.

25
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:37,337
If you would have agreed
with them,...

26
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,567
-...what would have happened?
- l' m a priest, not a politician!

27
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,741
The way they shorten
their speech...

28
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,142
... to stop the public
from going,...

29
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:45,110
...I cannot shorten
the incantations.

30
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,109
To live in this world, one has
to learn the ways of this world.

31
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,906
Your hosts are
also like customers.

32
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,114
One who wants to earn money,
has to agree with his customers.

33
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,117
-They may be customers,but l...
- Then you won't get any fees!

34
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,119
Such fees is a punishment for me!

35
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,623
I cannot go to
hell for their money.

36
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,592
Heaven and hell
are a different case.

37
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,323
But we have to eat!

38
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:07,599
And your religion
cannot fill our stomachs!

39
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,769
Because of your principles,...

40
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,637
... if you keep losing
hosts like this,...

41
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:13,002
...then how will you
manage this house?

42
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,501
Your village is small.
But your family is very big.

43
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:18,132
I cannot do both.

44
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,779
Neither can I make
the family small...

45
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,180
... nor can I increase
the village size.

46
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,738
- Understand? - But
l' ll ask you one thing.

47
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:24,984
Your daughter Shalini
has passed her metric...

48
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:26,747
... & is sitting idle at home.

49
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:28,351
Why can't she go out and work?

50
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:30,952
She will surely earn some money.

51
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,521
You mean that now l' ll have to
live on my daughter's earnings?

52
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,152
So what is the harm? In a job,
a salary is attained every month.

53
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,026
A priest's earnings
are unpredictable.

54
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,869
- You never know when to expect
it. - No, that will never happen.

55
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:46,369
Ram Shastri's daughter
will go out and work?

56
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,873
No. And she is
still very young too.

57
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:50,498
She is a child.

58
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,654
Listen! It is already
8 o' clock in the morning.

59
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,692
I've already returned
from the fields,...

60
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:08,387
...and you are still sleeping!

61
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:10,996
- Will you get up or not?
- Who is it?

62
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,799
What is this?

63
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,930
- You are laughing?
- On your face...

64
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:27,001
Uncle! Uncle, don't tell him.
Don't tell him what happened.

65
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:38,216
But what is the matter?
Why are you laughing?

66
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,029
So uncle? Isn't he
looking like a king?

67
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,027
So, this was your mischief?

68
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:54,834
I thought that only small
children sleep till so late.

69
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:56,439
So I made you look older.

70
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,440
When l' ll teach you a lesson,
you' ll always remember it.

71
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,239
Okay, first go and
remove the moustache.

72
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,041
- You are looking like a demon.
- Really?

73
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,250
- Uncle, this moustache
will never come off. - Why?

74
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,458
Because it is made of coal tar.

75
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:15,852
It won't come off, even if
you' ll scrub it with a stone.

76
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:17,460
- Never? - Never!

77
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,263
But whatever you say. This
moustache is praiseworthy.

78
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,732
Atleast, this moustache
made father laugh.

79
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,985
Wait! Why are you entering
so quietly, like a thief?

80
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:55,294
Where are you coming from?
Where had you gone till now?

81
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:58,938
Forget about doing
housework,....

82
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:01,168
... she doesn't have time
to come and eat too.

83
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:05,110
Just look.
You have become so old.

84
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,803
And you play like children.

85
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,312
In your age, I was the
mother of two children.

86
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,315
And you behave like
a small child yourself.

87
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,117
I say, stop it!

88
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,564
The daughter
has grown so old...

89
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,533
... and the father is
getting others married.

90
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,198
But not his own daughter.

91
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:05,364
Look! There is already a
shortage of food in the house.

92
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,006
And this crow is giving
the message...

93
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:08,371
... of the arrival of a guest!

94
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:14,179
Go away from here!
Someone make him go away!

95
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,980
He's not even moving.

96
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,585
Sending the crow
away is of no use.

97
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,385
We should stop the train in
which the guests are coming.

98
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:26,854
Tell me! Will you come
with me? You won't? I' ll go.

99
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,258
Hey! You are secretly
smoking a cigarette?

100
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,244
- Hey, it's you?
- If l' ll tell uncle,...

101
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:48,213
-...do you know what will
happen? - How will you go?

102
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,014
- l' ll tie you up.
- With what will you tie me?

103
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,617
Will you tie a rope
around my neck?

104
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:57,013
Yes, l' ll surely do
that. But not a rope.

105
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,617
- A `Mangalsutra'. - Come on!

106
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,426
You cannot tie a
`Mangalsutra' around my neck.

107
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,429
I' m a Brahmin, and you' re not.

108
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,634
The entire village will
malign our family name.

109
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:10,026
Let them.

110
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,635
What difference does
that make to me?

111
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:19,178
Will you drink up
the entire pond,...

112
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,237
... or will you leave
a little for others?

113
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,239
Why do you say anything?

114
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,311
You want water to get rid
of tobacco smell.

115
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,655
And I want water
to fill my stomach.

116
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:37,255
- Father. - What is it?

117
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,161
I want to buy a Botany record
for college.

118
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,368
I'd told you earlier...

119
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,393
... that I don't have money
for your college education.

120
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,706
But you ignored me
and said that...

121
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,264
... the education is free
for the first year.

122
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,671
Education is free.

123
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,676
But the government
doesn't give free books.

124
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:54,072
- What did you say?
- I didn't say anything.

125
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,217
But I say that one who cannot
reach their aims....

126
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,684
... shouldn't think of victory.

127
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:03,483
That is foolishness.
Just look at his hair style.

128
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,283
He is a Brahmin. A Brahmin
of the new generation.

129
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:13,358
Take this Rs.2. I
just have this much.

130
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,301
- Have you completed
your prayers? - Yes.

131
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:22,105
Yes! This is it.
Come on, get down.

132
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:24,707
This is my brother's home.
Get down.

133
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,877
Really? We have
reached uncle's home.

134
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,112
Wait. I' ll have the money sent.

135
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,353
Brother! Sister-in-law!

136
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:45,128
- Where are you?
- Come, Janki.

137
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,733
Really? Uncle?

138
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,000
- Mother! - Poorna!

139
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,329
The crow had told us yesterday.

140
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,339
It was useless for
you to chase it away.

141
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,534
Come aunty!

142
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,509
Where is sister-in-law?

143
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:02,137
First tell me
about yourself, Janki.

144
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:08,152
- Brother! - Hey! Why
did you start crying?

145
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:10,014
Is your husband fine?

146
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:14,421
- Come sister. - Sister-in-law.
- Really? Aunty!

147
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:19,255
Brother, first let
the horse cart go.

148
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:21,389
The fool was asking for Rs.2.50.

149
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,561
I have decided at Rs.2.
Let him go.

150
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:27,807
- Go and give the Rs.2 to the
horse cart owner.-But father,...

151
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,275
-...my Botany record?
- Go and give it to him.

152
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:36,040
Why are you crying?
Is your husband fine?

153
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:39,184
Don't ask!

154
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,051
- Shall I tell you? - Tell us!
- What happened, Meenu?

155
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:48,387
Actually, my father
has run away from home.

156
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:52,192
Ran away from home?
And you are laughing?

157
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:58,461
- Aren't you ashamed? - Brother,
you had lovingly named me Janki.

158
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,604
My fate was just like my name.

159
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,801
Lord Rama's wife, Janaki, had
faced just 1 4 years of exile.

160
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:08,304
God knows how many years
my exile is going to last.

161
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:12,213
1 4 years, 1 4 months or 1 4 days.

162
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:16,615
Whatever it may be.
Now l' ll live with you.

163
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:20,282
Till then, you will have
to do everything for me.

164
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,318
Food, water and everything else.

165
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,029
Oh God! This is empty.

166
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:34,835
Sister-in-law, I don't
need food right now.

167
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,105
I am feeling very dizzy.

168
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:39,244
Just give me
one big glass of milk.

169
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:40,843
And one for my daughter too.

170
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:45,009
You know that I can
live on just milk too.

171
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,445
What can we do?

172
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:56,859
Here, I have come.
What is this?

173
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,124
Where are you getting
dressed and going?

174
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,662
Won't you pay homage
to your late father?

175
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,529
All that can be done later.
You have come so late!

176
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:06,400
There, the collector
has come on rounds.

177
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,472
I have to go and greet him.

178
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,576
Greeting your boss
is more important...

179
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,043
... than paying homage
to your father?

180
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:13,712
Can't you tell him,...

181
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,314
... you were paying homage
to your father, that's why...

182
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:16,872
-...you got a little late?
- Yes, I can tell him.

183
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:18,918
But the collector
can also say that...

184
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,284
...I don't need to
go to work at all.

185
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:25,882
Listen, next year, we' ll
fulfill these rites twice.

186
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:29,683
- Won't that be a sin? - Why
are you concerned with that?

187
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,898
You want your fees,
right? Take this.

188
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,495
Sir, I am a priest,
not a beggar!

189
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:49,576
- Father, my Botany record? -To
hell with your Botany record!

190
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,953
If these men have to keep
greeting the officers...

191
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,319
... Iike this, then your studies
won't last for long!

192
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:57,579
Now go away from here!

193
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:08,264
Listen Gautam, l
feel pity for you

194
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,100
Take this Rs.2, and
buy the Botany record.

195
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:18,933
No, Usha. The price of
a Botany record is Rs.2.

196
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:23,206
But pity is very expensive.
And I cannot repay you for that.

197
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:24,549
Take it.

198
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,751
Is there any theater here,
or not?

199
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,361
- There is. - Which movie
is showing right now?

200
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:40,565
You won't like it, aunty.

201
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,226
- Why? - It is not
of any use to you.

202
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:44,960
But atleast, tell me the name.

203
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,635
`Pati-Patni'(Husband and wife)!

204
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,373
See? Now your daughter has
also started taunting me.

205
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,375
That is her habit.

206
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,978
Hey! You have returned so soon?

207
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,989
What happened? Why did you
throw the scriptures like this?

208
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:05,387
What else shall I do?

209
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:07,982
I can't throw them
on those who deserve it!

210
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:10,987
But what is the matter?
Why are you getting so angry?

211
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:13,032
Just understand that
the world has forgotten...

212
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,398
...it's religion and the priests
have forgotten their work!

213
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,399
This world has become new!

214
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,632
There is no value of worship
and customs in this world!

215
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:27,008
Then how will you take
care of your home and us?

216
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,510
God will take care
of this world.

217
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,615
Shall I tell you where
the entire problem lies?

218
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,815
The world is changing. But
you are not ready to change.

219
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,389
Then what do you want? Even l
should become like those who...

220
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,822
...have divided the world
amongst each other?!

221
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,518
Those who have no character,
principles or customs?!

222
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,691
They are just bothered
about their jobs and money!

223
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,661
But you cannot reform
the entire world alone.

224
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,072
The world that couldn't be
reformed by...

225
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,040
... Gods like Rama and Krishna,
cannot be reformed by me.

226
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:58,700
I can just leave such a world.

227
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:11,321
- Yes, father? - I am
feeling very anxious today.

228
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:17,051
- Sing some poetry to relax me.
- Okay, father.

229
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:22,662
" When..."

230
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:28,403
"... you draw blank"

231
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:38,346
" Everything seems confused"

232
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:47,090
" Who protects religion..."

233
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:52,496
"... sincerely"

234
00:18:54,733 --> 00:19:02,504
" He wins over the world"

235
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:12,911
Brothers and sisters!
Shivaratri is approaching.

236
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,710
We have to stay awake all night.

237
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,920
That's why, to spend the
time, we will rehearse a drama.

238
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:26,929
All of you keep quiet!

239
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:31,731
All you children of
the new generation, keep quiet!

240
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,800
Now, one by one, ask
for whatever you want.

241
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:38,136
You will get whatever
you will ask for.

242
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:40,411
This is the blessing
of a Goddess.

243
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,742
- l' ll ask for something!
- Keep quiet!

244
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,547
Don't create such havoc!

245
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:46,307
This is not the ticket counter
of a theater.

246
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:48,612
This is the assembly
of the Goddess.

247
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,554
All of you ask in turns.

248
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:58,953
- Hey, get up. - Oh,
Goddess. My name is Gautam.

249
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:02,767
I study in the first year.
I have just one dream.

250
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,803
I want to get admission
in a medical college, and...

251
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:06,168
...I want to become a doctor.

252
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,765
What is there to laugh about?

253
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,837
- Oh Goddess?
- You must have heard.

254
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,511
A man becomes half a doctor
after killing a 100 patients.

255
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,976
First kill 100 men,
and become half a doctor.

256
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:23,179
Worship me on every Shivaratri.

257
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:28,353
After that l' ll come and
make you a complete doctor.

258
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:30,629
Goddess, I want
to complete my B.A....

259
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:31,994
... and become an officer
in the army.

260
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,199
- What is your name?
- Chamchu Shastri.

261
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:38,466
Why are you laughing, Oh Goddess?

262
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:43,004
His name is Chamchuram, and he
wants to become an army officer.

263
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,005
First you change your name.

264
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:49,874
Because your name is horrible.
Not worth an army officer.

265
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:53,712
- What is your name?
- My name is Devi (Goddess).

266
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,377
What?! How can there
be two Goddesses?

267
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,817
No, Goddess! She
is Devi from Earth.

268
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:06,222
I want a handsome husband.

269
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,031
Impudent children! Stop it! Or
else, the Goddess will go away!

270
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:16,037
- And my husband should own
100 acres of land. - 100 acres?

271
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,767
I can give you 100 acres
of land, if I want.

272
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:24,082
But what shall I do? The Goddess
who's ruling lndia nowadays,...

273
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:28,041
...has ordered to give
only 18 acres of land.

274
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,257
- Hail the Goddess!
- It's my turn now.

275
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:35,057
- What is your name? - Poorna.

276
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:39,523
- Who gave you such a nice name?
- My parents did.

277
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:42,531
I am the third daughter
out of their four children.

278
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:47,263
They had decided that after me,
this family will be complete.

279
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:50,666
- Then, is the family complete?
- That is what didn't happen.

280
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:55,278
They didn't know that these
four will also arrive after me.

281
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,726
First you change your name
from Poorna to Apoorna.

282
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:11,287
- Okay.
- Now tell me what you want.

283
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,799
I want to become a
very famous singer.

284
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:20,339
I want my records also to...

285
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:24,105
...play on the radio
all the time.

286
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,904
Of course, they will.

287
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,308
Run! Father has come.

288
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:33,352
Or else, both the devotees
and the Goddess...

289
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,320
... will be taught a lesson.
Run away!

290
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,728
- The children were enacting
a drama. - Yes, I saw that.

291
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:49,725
- Did you understand anything?
- Yes, I understood.

292
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:53,329
All of them are worthless.
Useless!

293
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:56,604
Then you did not understand
anything.

294
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:59,744
You can only read
the scriptures.

295
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:03,140
But you cannot understand
your children's feelings.

296
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:08,787
Can't one who is born
to a poor mother,...

297
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:11,017
...not even dream of happiness?

298
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,370
Look how the ornaments
are shining now.

299
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,638
Yes, it looks
like real gold now.

300
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,171
Who can make
these fools understand?

301
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:36,640
A person can never scrub brass
enough to turn it into gold.

302
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:40,018
And even if it does,
nobody will believe...

303
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:42,782
...Ram Shastri's daughters
are wearing real gold.

304
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:47,382
You left at dawn and are
returning in the evening.

305
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,182
Have you eaten anything?

306
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,398
You must be thinking
that I am talking too much.

307
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:57,197
Isn't it? But how
can I stop myself?

308
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:00,930
- There is nothing at home
to eat and... - I heard you!

309
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,603
Take this Rs.5.

310
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:09,210
Rs.5? But where did you
get so much money from?

311
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:12,908
I can see that you want to
ask me thousands of questions.

312
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,420
I have neither stolen
them nor begged for them!

313
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,688
This is my hard
earned money. Take it!

314
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,018
There are boils on your hands.

315
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:26,695
What else will happen
when l' ll break stones?

316
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,229
But this has shown me one thing.

317
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:32,697
In today's world, stones are
more expensive than incantations.

318
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,236
But, did someone see you
while breaking the stones?

319
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,238
I had covered my face!

320
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:43,436
How must Ram Shastri be
looking while breaking stones?

321
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:57,260
You are laughing, and
my heart is bleeding!

322
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:02,957
There are boils on these hands.
And my heart has been wounded.

323
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:08,006
For you, whatever the
climate and season may be,...

324
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,270
...only laughter is important!

325
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:15,469
"The earth laughs,
there's joy everywhere"

326
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:30,156
" Rays laugh in every bud"

327
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:33,157
" Even I laugh every time"

328
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:10,127
" Under the sky,
youth laughs again and again"

329
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:15,131
"The sun melts"

330
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:22,138
" And the moonlight showers
with love"

331
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:28,043
" Laughs and sings"

332
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:36,959
" Laughs and sings,
the season changes"

333
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:11,592
" My scarf slips off
Like a child..."

334
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:15,932
" Like a child I laugh"

335
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:20,731
" No matter what the world says"

336
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:28,079
" My bangles tinkle"

337
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:34,211
" Every moment..."

338
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:42,886
"the jingling of my anklets
torment me"

339
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:15,452
" Laugh and live"

340
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:18,995
" Laugher is the symbol of life"

341
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:33,075
" It seems every where..."

342
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:39,948
"... even God himself laughs"

343
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,489
" Happiness of the heart..."

344
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:55,088
"... the more expensive
the more cheap"

345
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:27,722
What is it?

346
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:32,734
If I want to give you
something, will you take it?

347
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:37,733
If you cross your
limits, l' ll slap you.

348
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:42,010
Look, I have bought
a sari for you.

349
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:47,010
- Why? - I don't like it when
you roam around in torn clothes.

350
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:49,551
Why don't you like it?

351
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:55,023
- I don't know.
- Look, l' ll do one thing.

352
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,020
There are several people in the
village who don't have clothes.

353
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:00,159
I' ll send all of them to you.

354
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,763
- Why? - You can
distribute clothes to them.

355
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,270
But I have brought
this sari for you.

356
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:14,371
Look, it is not nice to look
into torn clothes. Give.

357
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:38,794
You did very well. He gave
you a sari. And you took it.

358
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:41,962
Why didn't you die of shame?

359
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,800
- So what calamity took place?
- Calamity?

360
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,404
You won't be able to see
that calamity so easily.

361
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,851
But you should understand...

362
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,820
...the big difference in taking
a sari from a man & from a shop.

363
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:59,084
So what? Give me money and l' ll
go and take it from the shop.

364
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:01,823
You very well know
that I don't have money.

365
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,829
I feel pity for you.

366
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,491
And I feel like crying on myself.

367
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:10,234
But what can a mother do?

368
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,231
Maybe my child has
just rags in her fate!

369
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,632
Show it to me.

370
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,846
It is silken, just like you.

371
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:26,647
Listen, did someone see
you while taking the sari?

372
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:34,450
A mother has to ask. We poor
people have nothing else.

373
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:36,851
We just have our honor.

374
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:42,389
You want to wear it, right?
Wear it.

375
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:58,874
During mealtime, our house looks
exactly like a grain store.

376
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,386
There is a lot of crowd,
and less of grains!

377
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,390
Enough! Now stop
laughing. Start eating.

378
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:10,156
Wait!
Nobody will touch the food.

379
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,388
Before eating, I want
to find out something.

380
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,163
If you eat,
l' ll break your hand!

381
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:20,566
Today, someone has
committed a big sin.

382
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:23,901
I won't take
the name of the sinner.

383
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:28,301
But I want that person to come
forward and confess the sin!

384
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:33,316
Till that won't happen,
nobody will eat.

385
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:37,719
Give me something to eat!

386
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:40,324
It is better to beg like this.

387
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:44,925
But what a family member of Ram
Shastri did today, is not good.

388
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,660
Have pity on the poor.

389
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,541
Mother, you must
have done something.

390
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:01,669
Confess fast. I' m very hungry.

391
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,450
Give me some food.

392
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:19,688
This is that sin, right?

393
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:21,763
Yes, this is it.

394
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:25,596
Have pity on the poor.

395
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,971
Give this to that beggar woman!

396
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,235
Alright. You can eat now.

397
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,991
What is the meaning of getting
up from the meal like this?

398
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:52,724
- l' m very hungry. - l' m
going to give this to her too.

399
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:00,493
Her sari was torn, and I gave
her a new one. Was that a sin?

400
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:02,401
Couldn't you take
permission from me?

401
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,009
Permission for having
pity on someone?

402
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:07,809
I don't think
this was just pity.

403
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,346
If you have understood,
it is good.

404
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,319
- What nonsense are you saying?
- I mean that,...

405
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:19,688
-...I love Shalini.
- This can never happen!

406
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,686
She is so innocent!

407
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,826
If she mingles freely with you,
you are trying to trap her?

408
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,831
I' m not trying to trap her. I
love her and want to marry her.

409
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:34,027
And just listen. I
will marry only her.

410
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,830
Ashok, are you in your senses?

411
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,838
Do you know
how high her caste is?

412
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:43,839
All that are old beliefs.

413
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:47,313
- These are new times.
- New times!

414
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:49,380
What has these new times
given to this world?

415
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:52,647
- Forget about her right now!
Or else... - Or else?

416
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:56,056
Or else, l' ll have to
forget that you are my son.

417
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,228
These are also
often repeated words.

418
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:02,863
In every era of this world,every
father has aid this to his son.

419
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:07,060
- What do you mean? - Father,
I don't want to forget Shalini.

420
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:10,871
- How dare you?! - I know
what you will say now.

421
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:14,669
`You' re not my son! I don't want
to see you! Get out of my house!'

422
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,077
`You won't get a single
dime from me!' Right?

423
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,482
You won't feel the
need to do all this.

424
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:23,879
I' ll go away myself. So that you
are not defamed in the society.

425
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:28,889
So that people cannot accuse you
of throwing your son out of home.

426
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:32,563
I' m going.

427
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,537
Do you know Shastriji's home,...

428
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:40,902
... where a girl
called Shalini stays?

429
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,107
Yes! That is the house.

430
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,099
Do one thing, take this letter
tomorrow...

431
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,506
Who gave you this sari?

432
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:52,378
The one you are giving this
letter for, has given this sari.

433
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,915
She is so generous.

434
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:17,930
Take us with you too,
to the theater.

435
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,941
- I cannot go.
- Look, sister-in-law,...

436
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,781
When a sister comes
to a brother' s home,...

437
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:25,749
... she asks for several things.

438
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,414
But I don't want anything.

439
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:32,315
None of the delicacies.

440
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,955
Just show me a movie sometimes.

441
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:39,152
Your treasure
will never get empty.

442
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:42,557
- Really? - There is not
even enough to eat here.

443
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,964
And your mother want
to go to see a movie!

444
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:48,434
Did you hear that, Meenu?
You are fond of movies!

445
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:51,209
-And I have to hear such taunts!
-I don't say anything to anybody.

446
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,643
I just say that this is not the
correct way to bring up children.

447
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:55,904
They should not be given
such expensive habits.

448
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:57,446
Stop it!

449
00:36:57,615 --> 00:37:00,982
Meena's father works in the
tax office of the theater.

450
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,346
We get free passes
to the movies.

451
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,985
And that too, four passes.

452
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:09,990
Both of us see the movie with 2,
and mother sells the other two.

453
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:13,231
Stop it!
Since we have come here,...

454
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:16,997
...we can only hear
one thing. Hunger!

455
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:36,620
What is this?

456
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,815
You' re giving money offered
to God for seeing movies?

457
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:44,355
Never mind. Both the money
and the movie are God's.

458
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:46,630
Do you know what the
name of the movie is?

459
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:49,697
- `Bhagvat Mahima'.
- Mother! Did you hear that?

460
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:53,359
Hurry up, mother.
God is calling you.

461
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:07,513
- Sister, tell us again what
you had said. - Okay, I will.

462
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:10,250
And l' ll see who
says it the fastest.

463
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:13,651
- l' ll say it! - Let me say it.

464
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:21,062
- This is very easy. - Then
say it. Who's stopping you?

465
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:33,073
What nonsense are you saying?

466
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,075
Hey doctor, you are very proud
of yourself, right? The say this.

467
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:43,084
Not like this. Say it fast.

468
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,098
Mother has come. We' ll
continue after the meal.

469
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:02,098
Come here.

470
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:10,714
What is it?

471
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,819
Nothing has been cooked today.

472
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,989
There was nothing to cook.

473
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:23,320
These poor children
are playing there.

474
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:26,525
How can I make them
understand now?

475
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,333
That today their plates and
their stomachs will remain empty?

476
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,634
I' ll make them
understand in some way.

477
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,852
Now repeat fast
whatever I will say.

478
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,959
Today, the food is not prepared.

479
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,756
Even if it's prepared,
it's not good.

480
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:01,162
Have you still not understood?

481
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:05,366
We are not hungry today.

482
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,769
Say it loudly.

483
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:51,404
Sister, I am hungry.

484
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:11,432
Give me something to eat!

485
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:35,449
What are you looking at?

486
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,259
Hey, why are you crying?

487
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,465
I am very hungry.

488
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,993
Food hasn't been
cooked at home today.

489
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:49,136
Will you eat my leftovers?

490
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:51,636
Here, eat it.

491
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:13,288
Tell me. Where did
you get this rice from?

492
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,294
- Tell me. - What will he say?

493
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:19,835
This is my brother's home, who
is so religious and a priest!

494
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:23,029
And this is his son!
He begs from beggars!

495
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,505
He eats from their used vessels!

496
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:26,708
I have seen
that with my own eyes!

497
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,300
I caught him myself!

498
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,912
Isn't it a shameful matter
for the entire family?

499
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:34,509
Oh God!
What kind of a day is this?

500
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:38,319
First the movie was bad.
Then this scene was even worse.

501
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:42,918
You were teaching me the way
to bring up children, right?

502
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,787
Today, I have seen your way too.

503
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:49,931
If my daughter would have done
this, I would have killed myself!

504
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:53,732
The children of dogs and pigs
are better than such children!

505
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:02,144
Sinner! Come with me.

506
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:14,217
Don't hit him!
He's just a child!

507
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:36,377
No! Nobody can save you today!

508
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:40,573
- l' ll kill you! - Mother! - You
don't come in between, Shalini!

509
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:42,982
Couldn't he stop is
hunger for just one day?

510
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,385
Can you stop your anger?

511
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:49,627
When one is hungry
he can't remember...

512
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,993
... what is written
in the scriptures!

513
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:56,198
And he is still a child! How
can he understand all this?

514
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,236
That aunty, who has
become 50 years old,...

515
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:01,329
...cannot stop going
to the theater!

516
00:44:01,905 --> 00:44:04,642
This child, who hasn't even
turned 10 years old yet,...

517
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,610
...should stop his hunger?!

518
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:08,875
He' ll commit a sin
if he doesn't!

519
00:44:09,046 --> 00:44:11,606
Shall I tell you what
the biggest sin is?

520
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:15,880
Hunger! And hitting a hungry
child is an even bigger crime!

521
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,298
- Don't drink this, Shalini!
- Why?

522
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,501
Because this contains poison?

523
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:49,908
You have found a nice way
to get free of your troubles!

524
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:53,150
Mother, after what you
have done today,...

525
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:56,517
...no children will be
able to trust their mother!

526
00:45:57,154 --> 00:46:02,217
You used to ask me when I would
become sensible and responsible.

527
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,218
But today I have seen how
sensible and responsible you are!

528
00:46:06,363 --> 00:46:08,126
But what else could I do,
Shalini?

529
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:12,531
There is nothing at home
for the children to eat.

530
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,000
So you would take eight
lives because of that?!

531
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:20,405
- Your children are of
such less value. - Stop it.

532
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:24,339
The children's hunger
had made blinded me!

533
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:27,546
I couldn't see them suffering.

534
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:32,154
That's why I hardened myself
and wanted to poison them.

535
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:36,557
So that they can
sleep peacefully forever!

536
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:41,754
Do you know why God has given
a heart and hands to a mother?

537
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,563
The heart is for loving.

538
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:47,771
And the hands are
for giving blessings.

539
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:51,032
But your heart
has become of stone!

540
00:46:51,408 --> 00:46:53,273
And your hands have
become the hands of fate!

541
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:55,777
You are making poison
for your own children!

542
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:58,315
But if this is what
makes you happy,...

543
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,579
...then l' ll go right
now and awaken everybody!

544
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:03,378
First I will drink and
then the rest of them!

545
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:06,585
Because I am elder
to all of them!

546
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:10,191
Don't say that, Shalini!

547
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:21,602
Till now, I was your daughter
and you were my mother.

548
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:24,070
But now,
the relations have changed.

549
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:27,602
Now you are my daughter,
and I am your mother!

550
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:31,610
Yes, mother. Henceforth, l
am a mother for all of you!

551
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:36,549
For my brothers,
sisters, you and father!

552
00:47:37,254 --> 00:47:41,088
Now l' ll prove myself
as a mother!

553
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:48,229
What did you say? You will work?

554
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,834
Never! Where is your mother?

555
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:52,826
There's no need to ask mother.

556
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:55,101
I have made her sit in one place.

557
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:58,173
I am not a child now.
I can think for myself.

558
00:47:58,275 --> 00:48:00,004
But I am not dead yet!

559
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:03,644
I can still go and
break stones on the road!

560
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:07,114
A great priest like you won't
get the work of breaking stones.

561
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:11,248
Like a graduate cannot work
as a peon even if he wants to.

562
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:13,356
What has happened to you today?

563
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:15,185
Something has really happened
to me.

564
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:18,896
If someone else
would have seen what I saw,...

565
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,454
... he would have gone mad.

566
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:23,867
Death has entered this
house in the form of hunger.

567
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:27,532
The entire family
is in danger of it.

568
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:30,034
But I have also decided.

569
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:34,004
Till I am alive, l
won't let death win!

570
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,676
But my heart has made
some other decision.

571
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:41,378
That you should get married.

572
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:45,282
There are 10 hungry people
in the way of your decision.

573
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:48,687
They have several
dreams and hopes.

574
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:52,887
But their dreams are much more
important than my marriage!

575
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:56,491
I will live and die for them!

576
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:59,336
Inspite of knowing all this,...

577
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:00,894
... you want me to get
married, and not work?

578
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,907
In front of you,
l' ll ask all of them.

579
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:08,500
- Tell me what I should do!
- You should work!

580
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:11,915
What is the harm if
she earns, brother?

581
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:18,653
- You will work? - Yes, I will.

582
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,523
You are the chairman
of the Panchayat court.

583
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:26,261
You know so many people.
Can't you find a job for me?

584
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:31,423
- Did you ask Shastri?
- Why ask him?

585
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,972
To keep hunger away
from our home,...

586
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:38,464
... I will have to come out
of the house.

587
00:49:57,594 --> 00:50:00,961
The food has been cooked.
You don't need to do anything.

588
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:02,956
I' ll come back from
work and do the rest.

589
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,765
You do everything.

590
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:08,137
- Go carefully to office.
- Okay, mother.

591
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:51,505
Shall I say something?
Will you mind?

592
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:55,179
Why will we work,
if we are not poor?

593
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:58,187
But what happened today,
is not good.

594
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:01,524
Why don't you buy a
new sari and blouse?

595
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:05,495
It is not for fashion,
but for decency.

596
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:11,289
You don't know, Sudha. In my
house, someone needs books.

597
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:12,833
And someone needs clothes.

598
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:16,369
There may be something to eat
today, and nothing for tomorrow.

599
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,833
My house is
like a whole village.

600
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:32,285
I have got my first salary
today. Rs.170. Take this.

601
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,558
Won't you give me
your blessings?

602
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,854
I have gotten people married
for just half a rupee.

603
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:42,465
I have worked
for quarter of a rupee.

604
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:45,291
I saw so much money
for the first time today.

605
00:51:45,368 --> 00:51:46,665
Hence, I was speechless.

606
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:51,867
- Take it, father.
- Keep it with you.

607
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:55,341
You are the mother of this house.

608
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,355
I never defeat you, uncle.

609
00:52:14,531 --> 00:52:17,261
I am a loser in life.

610
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,501
That's why,
I always win in games.

611
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,264
So you finally missed your son!

612
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:26,509
Your heart is still
suffering for him.

613
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:31,103
- Right, uncle?
- You have caught me today.

614
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:36,108
But should that fool have left
his home and gone into the army?

615
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:40,785
Whatever it is. He won't lag
behind anybody in the army too.

616
00:52:41,558 --> 00:52:43,617
He always defeated me in games.

617
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:45,924
Just see! He' ll defeat
the enemy in the war too.

618
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:50,397
- Telegram! - Uncle, go.
There is a telegram.

619
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:51,534
I' m coming.

620
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,942
Uncle, who's telegram is it?

621
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,944
I don't know. You read it.

622
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:08,949
What is written in the telegram?

623
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:12,678
Tell me, what is written.

624
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:17,824
Shalini, why don't you tell me
what is written in the telegram?

625
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:25,166
- Weren't you saying that
nobody can defeat Ashok? - Yes?

626
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:29,970
- Death has defeated him.
- What?

627
00:53:31,608 --> 00:53:32,973
He was killed in the war.

628
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,205
Sister...

629
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,645
... have you told brother...

630
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:10,704
... that you will get him
admitted to medical college?

631
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:12,472
Yes, so?

632
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:16,014
Won't you appoint a
music teacher for me?

633
00:54:16,653 --> 00:54:19,554
What a question to ask at
this hour! Go to sleep.

634
00:54:19,656 --> 00:54:21,021
We' ll discuss
this in the morning.

635
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,632
Ghasite, why is
Gautam doing sit-ups?

636
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:36,036
I think it's preparation
for marriage.

637
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:40,232
No. Shastri will not get
his daughter married first.

638
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:43,568
If he gets her married,
they will go hungry.

639
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,648
That's also true.

640
00:54:46,683 --> 00:54:48,514
Gautam is coming, let's ask him.

641
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:53,089
Gautam, why were
you doing sit-ups?

642
00:54:53,089 --> 00:54:55,523
I have to go for an interview
for admission to medical college

643
00:54:55,692 --> 00:55:00,652
That is why you were
begging before God?

644
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:05,526
But it is not so easy to get
admission to medical college.

645
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:07,670
So what?
I have passed in first class.

646
00:55:07,904 --> 00:55:10,065
Hear that!
He has stood first in class.

647
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:14,065
Oh really?
But that alone is not enough.

648
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:17,544
- Then what else is required?
- Do you have a reference?

649
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:22,082
Nowadays, even death comes
with a recommendation.

650
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:27,679
If you don't have a reference,
nothing can be done.

651
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:34,559
I have just one dream, uncle.
That I become a doctor.

652
00:55:36,132 --> 00:55:39,101
Only good marks are not
enough to get admission.

653
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:42,471
People say that one
even needs reference.

654
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:45,105
- Who told you that?
- Everyone says so.

655
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:50,109
Out of worry, Gautam
cannot sleep all night.

656
00:55:50,747 --> 00:55:52,112
Please do something, uncle.

657
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:53,714
You' ll have to do
something for me.

658
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:58,113
What are you thinking? You must
be knowing someone in Poona.

659
00:55:59,089 --> 00:56:02,581
I' m not asking you to go there.
I' ll go there myself.

660
00:56:02,759 --> 00:56:06,126
Can't you see!
Uncle is deep in thought.

661
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:07,330
Yes.

662
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:12,464
Do one thing. I have an old
friend in Poona who's an MLA.

663
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:14,600
I' ll write a
letter in his name.

664
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:19,998
Go and meet him. But don't
mention this to anybody.

665
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:21,077
I won't.

666
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,643
Where will you live in Poona?
Do you know anyone there?

667
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:29,052
No, but l' ll
arrange something.

668
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:33,148
That will not do. You can
go and live with my niece.

669
00:56:33,656 --> 00:56:35,624
Take this card,
her name and address is on it.

670
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:40,523
- Uncle, write her a letter.
- On one condition.

671
00:56:40,797 --> 00:56:44,164
When you become a doctor, you' ll
have to treat me free of charge.

672
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:46,669
Not only you,
l' ll treat for free...

673
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:48,637
... all those who come to me
with your reference.

674
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:50,170
Alright.
Now massage my legs.

675
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,388
Wow!
You dance very well.

676
00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:12,056
Feel at home here.

677
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,795
You can stay here
as long as you like.

678
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:19,660
Once Mala's programme is over,
she' ll be with you always.

679
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:22,405
Shalini, this programme
is making me nervous.

680
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:24,441
That's natural. You are
performing on stage...

681
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:25,908
... for the first time.

682
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,411
You must come
to see my programme.

683
00:57:28,845 --> 00:57:33,077
- Here's your invitation.
- I will surely come.

684
00:57:41,724 --> 00:57:46,423
Look child, the easiest way
is not always the best way.

685
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:50,133
I don't agree that one gets
admission in medical college...

686
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,691
... only with reference.

687
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:53,870
The government has
formed committees....

688
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:55,838
...that interview every student.

689
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:59,108
Where they check the
capability of the candidate.

690
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:00,699
They see how many
marks he has scored.

691
00:58:00,877 --> 00:58:04,779
That's true.
But everyone says...

692
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:06,843
People say anything.

693
00:58:07,884 --> 00:58:10,580
You wasted time and
money coming to Poona.

694
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:12,853
Don't penalise yourself more.

695
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:17,117
Give my regards
to Jagannath Rao.

696
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,455
I will.
Thank you very much.

697
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:21,727
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

698
00:58:34,911 --> 00:58:40,747
Listen! I heard
everything you' ll spoke.

699
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:42,742
Come with me.

700
00:58:48,925 --> 00:58:52,759
Look, no job can be done
without a reference.

701
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:56,097
You want admission in medical
college for your brother?

702
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,161
I know a person
who can help you.

703
00:58:59,936 --> 00:59:02,905
He does not make proclamations
about helping the poor.

704
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:07,307
If you like, I can take
you to him in the evening.

705
00:59:08,945 --> 00:59:10,310
You don't believe me?

706
00:59:11,948 --> 00:59:14,917
- Alright, l' ll be going.
- No, it's not that.

707
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:17,846
My friend has a
dance show tonight.

708
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:20,514
- I have to go there.
- Alright, then tomorrow.

709
00:59:20,957 --> 00:59:23,926
`Bharat Rang Bhuvan - Poona.'

710
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:52,989
- Listen.
- Hello!

711
00:59:52,989 --> 00:59:56,823
Come out for a minute.
....Come!

712
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,560
- You' ll have to come
with me now. - Where?

713
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:10,227
The man I mentioned to you
is leaving for Delhi tonight.

714
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:12,905
If you want to meet him,
you can only meet him today.

715
01:00:13,009 --> 01:00:15,910
But my friend's show
is about to begin.

716
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:19,215
Now it is up to you. Either
watch your friend's show...

717
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:21,206
... or get your brother
admitted to medical college.

718
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:24,987
- Alright, l' ll come with you.
- Let's go.

719
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:29,592
`Next programme - Trap.'

720
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:36,931
Hello!....The P A
to the minister?

721
01:00:37,033 --> 01:00:40,196
How are you Mr.Mathur?
Yes, l' m Lal speaking.

722
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:42,867
The minister is busy?

723
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:45,872
No, I want only him. I have
some urgent work with him.

724
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:47,407
I' ll hold the line.

725
01:00:51,047 --> 01:00:54,608
It's good you came today.
Or after I'd left for Delhi...

726
01:00:56,052 --> 01:00:58,213
Hello, Minister?
I' m Lal speaking.

727
01:00:59,055 --> 01:01:01,615
No Sir, l' m not Ramlal,
l' m Shyamlal speaking.

728
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:03,423
How are you, sir?

729
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:06,124
It's nothing major,
it's just a small matter.

730
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:09,131
Someone need admission
in medical college.

731
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:11,964
Today is the last day.

732
01:01:12,068 --> 01:01:16,232
You can even do it
at the last minute.

733
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:19,905
Yes, he has
given the interview.

734
01:01:21,077 --> 01:01:23,443
You can assume that.
They are related to me.

735
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,045
They are close relatives.

736
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:29,449
What? Name and number?

737
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:32,452
Give me your brother's
name and number.

738
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:35,455
Sorry to have bothered you.

739
01:01:38,094 --> 01:01:40,927
I will give the name
and number to your P A.

740
01:02:10,359 --> 01:02:15,058
You don't want me to give the
name and number to the minister?

741
01:02:22,705 --> 01:02:23,672
Leave me!

742
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:13,273
What thoughts are you lost in?
Even your tea has gone cold.

743
01:04:14,817 --> 01:04:18,184
I was thinking that it's
many days since I came here.

744
01:04:18,821 --> 01:04:20,584
But I have no news on the
admission to medical college.

745
01:04:20,957 --> 01:04:23,448
It is only four days
since you came here.

746
01:04:23,826 --> 01:04:27,387
I am sure your brother will get
admission in medical college.

747
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:31,197
Look, so much has been written
about my dance in the papers.

748
01:04:31,434 --> 01:04:35,393
They say that my dance
was excellent.

749
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:38,807
`Shyamlal arrested.'

750
01:04:39,308 --> 01:04:41,208
What are you
reading in the paper?

751
01:04:41,444 --> 01:04:44,811
Damn! Did his photo have
to be published today!

752
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:47,149
This is the photo of a cheat...

753
01:04:47,149 --> 01:04:50,448
... who has looted many
people in various ways.

754
01:04:50,853 --> 01:04:54,311
The police has arrested him
on charges of forgery.

755
01:05:15,878 --> 01:05:20,838
Sister!
Don't leave us!

756
01:05:30,893 --> 01:05:32,656
I am everyone's
mother from today.

757
01:05:32,895 --> 01:05:36,854
Mother of my sisters, my
brothers, even you and father.

758
01:05:38,301 --> 01:05:41,134
Mother, feed your children.

759
01:05:42,305 --> 01:05:45,365
Mother, we are very hungry.

760
01:06:10,266 --> 01:06:12,496
Mother! Sister has returned!

761
01:06:12,935 --> 01:06:15,904
Brother, Chhotu,
sister is back!

762
01:06:23,946 --> 01:06:26,176
What a noise you' ll are making!
Shut-up of all you.

763
01:06:26,949 --> 01:06:28,507
Devi, get salt and pepper.

764
01:06:31,954 --> 01:06:33,717
Shut-up all of you!
Go from here!

765
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:36,916
- Take this, mother.
- You also go.

766
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:46,931
Why do you behave like
as if you know nothing?

767
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:51,438
Look at what you have done! I
got admission in medical college!

768
01:06:53,376 --> 01:06:54,977
What you have done for me,...

769
01:06:54,977 --> 01:06:58,071
... no sister in the world
must have done for her brother.

770
01:06:59,382 --> 01:07:02,351
`You have wasted time
and money coming to Poona.'

771
01:07:02,985 --> 01:07:04,543
`Don't penalise yourself more.'

772
01:07:13,262 --> 01:07:15,560
A diamond's real value is
known only in the market.

773
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:19,425
I never realised
your worth, Shalini.

774
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:22,564
But you are very worthy.

775
01:07:26,642 --> 01:07:31,579
Shalini, you were very naughty.
Where is that laughter of yours?

776
01:07:33,015 --> 01:07:36,974
I lost it in the city.

777
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:03,603
"The earth laughs,
there's joy everywhere"

778
01:08:04,046 --> 01:08:08,176
" Beauty laughs"

779
01:08:10,052 --> 01:08:12,612
" Rays laugh in every bud"

780
01:08:13,055 --> 01:08:15,421
" Even I laugh every time"

781
01:08:44,086 --> 01:08:46,384
You chose the perfect
time to go to Poona.

782
01:08:46,489 --> 01:08:49,492
Bravo! Admission for your
brother in medical college...

783
01:08:49,492 --> 01:08:51,392
... and a promotion for you!

784
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:55,856
- And a Rs.200 increment.
- Rs.200 increment?

785
01:08:57,099 --> 01:09:00,068
But I am wondering
how I will go to Delhi.

786
01:09:01,103 --> 01:09:03,663
Only a lucky few
get such a chance.

787
01:09:04,373 --> 01:09:08,110
That's true, but where
women are concerned...

788
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:12,069
... they have to lose
something to gain something.

789
01:09:12,515 --> 01:09:13,880
What did you lose?

790
01:09:16,118 --> 01:09:19,087
Why? Won't I lose a good
friend like you for this job?

791
01:09:45,548 --> 01:09:49,109
Father, I have got
a good job in Delhi.

792
01:09:49,752 --> 01:09:51,777
I will earn Rs.200
more than I get here.

793
01:09:52,154 --> 01:09:53,917
There are also chances
of getting a promotion.

794
01:09:55,157 --> 01:09:57,159
I had thought I will
only be able to...

795
01:09:57,159 --> 01:09:59,320
... arrange the basic
necessities for the family.

796
01:10:00,563 --> 01:10:02,724
Now even their
dreams can be fulfilled.

797
01:10:03,165 --> 01:10:05,656
There is no end
to one's dreams.

798
01:10:06,569 --> 01:10:08,170
This world is like a train...

799
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:10,573
... where the passenger first
tries to get a foothold,...

800
01:10:10,573 --> 01:10:12,632
... then aspires to get a seat,
and then, space to lie down.

801
01:10:13,676 --> 01:10:17,134
When he can get space to lie
down, why should he stand?

802
01:10:19,582 --> 01:10:23,143
Savitri, Tuesday is not
an auspicious day for travel.

803
01:10:23,586 --> 01:10:24,951
Ask her to leave on Wednesday.

804
01:10:30,192 --> 01:10:32,752
Shalini will live alone
in a city like Delhi.

805
01:10:33,195 --> 01:10:35,959
Why don't you go
with her, Janki?

806
01:10:36,198 --> 01:10:38,962
- No, brother.
- Let us go, mother.

807
01:10:39,201 --> 01:10:41,669
There are many movie halls
there. More than 30 movie halls.

808
01:10:41,804 --> 01:10:42,964
We can watch a movie every day.

809
01:10:43,205 --> 01:10:45,332
Shut-up!
Watch a movie everyday indeed!

810
01:10:45,474 --> 01:10:47,567
Delhi is a very big city.

811
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:50,178
The bigger the city,
the worse the situation there.

812
01:10:50,713 --> 01:10:52,578
What difference will
that make to you?

813
01:10:58,821 --> 01:11:03,986
- Sister....Sister!
- What is it?

814
01:11:04,226 --> 01:11:07,491
You are doing the dishes alone?
I' ll help you.

815
01:11:08,831 --> 01:11:11,595
Tell me honestly,
what do you want from me.

816
01:11:12,234 --> 01:11:13,462
Nothing, honestly.

817
01:11:13,636 --> 01:11:16,400
I know you want something.
I can read your face.

818
01:11:16,839 --> 01:11:20,366
- Tell me.
- So you even read faces.

819
01:11:22,244 --> 01:11:24,712
I want Rs.300 to
pay admission fees.

820
01:11:25,247 --> 01:11:28,683
What!
Rs.300?

821
01:11:29,251 --> 01:11:32,709
Rs.300 is just the admission
fees.I've another 5 years ahead.

822
01:11:32,921 --> 01:11:34,684
Wonder how much money
I will need every year.

823
01:11:35,658 --> 01:11:38,218
- When do you want Rs.300?
- Within a week.

824
01:11:49,271 --> 01:11:53,401
You have joined only today, and
you already want an advance?

825
01:11:54,677 --> 01:11:56,278
Sir, my brother has got
admission in medical college...

826
01:11:56,278 --> 01:11:57,745
... with great difficulty.

827
01:11:57,946 --> 01:12:01,040
If he doesn't pay the fees,
his name will be canceled.

828
01:12:01,283 --> 01:12:03,251
You can deduct the amount
from my salary every month.

829
01:12:04,687 --> 01:12:08,646
The women's hostel where you
stay is close to my house.

830
01:12:08,924 --> 01:12:11,694
Come home on Sunday.
You can meet my wife...

831
01:12:11,694 --> 01:12:13,059
... and also take the money.

832
01:12:13,295 --> 01:12:15,058
- Thank you, sir.
- No mention.

833
01:12:29,712 --> 01:12:34,740
- Where's your wife?
- My wife?...There she is.

834
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:42,757
- She is no more?
- No, she is not dead.

835
01:12:43,926 --> 01:12:45,291
But she is not alive either.

836
01:12:46,328 --> 01:12:47,795
She does not keep well.

837
01:12:49,331 --> 01:12:57,295
Since years, she is in hospital,
and I am here, alone.

838
01:12:58,340 --> 01:12:59,807
Absolutely alone.

839
01:13:01,343 --> 01:13:03,937
But you had called me here
to introduce me to your wife.

840
01:13:05,347 --> 01:13:06,974
You wanted Rs.300, didn't you?

841
01:13:14,623 --> 01:13:16,318
What games God plays!

842
01:13:16,959 --> 01:13:20,588
Where he gives beauty,
he doesn't give money.

843
01:13:22,364 --> 01:13:23,922
You wanted Rs.300, didn't you?

844
01:13:25,367 --> 01:13:28,131
Take it as a gift,
not an advance.

845
01:13:28,771 --> 01:13:31,934
For your brother
on your behalf.

846
01:13:34,777 --> 01:13:36,142
I understand.

847
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:42,012
Isn't there a single good
man in your rich world?

848
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:46,510
Here's Rs.300.

849
01:13:49,992 --> 01:13:51,152
You will not accept?

850
01:13:52,394 --> 01:13:54,396
You don't care whether
your brother...

851
01:13:54,396 --> 01:13:56,799
... gets admission in
medical college or not,...

852
01:13:56,799 --> 01:14:00,166
... whether he
becomes a doctor or not.

853
01:14:15,017 --> 01:14:17,884
`l need Rs.300 to pay
my admission fees.'

854
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:21,389
`Or you will not see your
brother's face again.'

855
01:14:22,925 --> 01:14:26,383
`How will I complete
five years of education?'

856
01:14:43,846 --> 01:14:48,078
`l have only one dream,
that I become a great singer.'

857
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:53,217
`Won't you appoint me
a music teacher?'

858
01:15:00,062 --> 01:15:03,225
`Even I have certain dreams,
some aspirations.'

859
01:15:04,066 --> 01:15:07,832
`l don't want to suffer
poverty and hunger once again.'

860
01:15:08,737 --> 01:15:12,696
`Get me married to a
rich, handsome man.'

861
01:15:16,078 --> 01:15:21,448
`l want to be a doctor,
I want to be a singer.'

862
01:16:57,579 --> 01:16:59,046
Sing in tune.

863
01:18:46,288 --> 01:18:48,654
- That would be so nice.
- Yes. - Mother, we are back!

864
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:52,260
On sister's birthday today,
we prayed to all the Gods.

865
01:18:52,694 --> 01:18:54,059
Here's the offering.

866
01:18:54,362 --> 01:18:55,920
May she live long.
