1
00:01:19,932 --> 00:01:22,331
Miwi, darling...

2
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,198
Get up.

3
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:26,998
What time is it?

4
00:01:27,632 --> 00:01:29,265
Get up!

5
00:01:44,032 --> 00:01:45,031
Your sister had an accident.

6
00:01:45,032 --> 00:01:46,931
Where is she?

7
00:01:46,932 --> 00:01:48,031
In the living room.

8
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,998
Pack her bag.

9
00:01:48,999 --> 00:01:50,931
Dad, are you ok?
You have blood on you.

10
00:01:50,932 --> 00:01:51,631
Hurry.

11
00:01:51,632 --> 00:01:52,331
Don't worry.

12
00:02:17,265 --> 00:02:18,664
Have your cellphone on hand.

13
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:24,464
Drive straight, ok?

14
00:02:24,465 --> 00:02:25,531
Ok.

15
00:02:26,865 --> 00:02:28,464
Do you have any money?

16
00:02:28,465 --> 00:02:29,531
Yes.

17
00:02:29,632 --> 00:02:30,697
Take everything with you.

18
00:02:30,965 --> 00:02:31,964
Go get it...

19
00:02:31,998 --> 00:02:32,831
and hurry up.

20
00:02:33,532 --> 00:02:34,364
Miwi...

21
00:03:32,298 --> 00:03:33,464
Juliana

22
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,197
I saw your clothes in the sink.

23
00:03:39,631 --> 00:03:41,530
Juliana tell me what happened, why...

24
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:26,763
It's Santiago, right?

25
00:04:44,031 --> 00:04:45,030
Hello?

26
00:04:46,698 --> 00:04:48,197
Yeah.
We are fine.

27
00:04:50,931 --> 00:04:54,597
Sorry, I had my cellphone on silent.

28
00:04:54,964 --> 00:04:56,130
Sorry.

29
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:59,463
We are on our way,
almost at the highway.

30
00:05:00,364 --> 00:05:02,530
No, we didn't get lost,
we are on our way.

31
00:05:03,331 --> 00:05:04,930
Take the next turn.

32
00:05:05,797 --> 00:05:07,596
She's fine.

33
00:05:09,364 --> 00:05:12,296
Juliana never tells me anything.

34
00:05:15,697 --> 00:05:16,696
Ok. I will.

35
00:05:26,864 --> 00:05:28,630
Make a left.

36
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:32,696
Make a left!

37
00:06:40,163 --> 00:06:41,762
Keep going.

38
00:06:41,763 --> 00:06:42,662
It's a shortcut.

39
00:07:16,963 --> 00:07:18,162
Sorry.

40
00:07:38,696 --> 00:07:41,195
This is hell of a shortcut.

41
00:08:00,863 --> 00:08:01,929
Dad?

42
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,662
Yes I'm ok.

43
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,162
They called me from his cellphone.

44
00:08:13,963 --> 00:08:16,429
Has anyone been to the house?

45
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:40,862
Shit.

46
00:09:34,196 --> 00:09:35,761
Are you OK?

47
00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:39,295
Do you want some soda?

48
00:09:42,096 --> 00:09:42,995
No.

49
00:09:48,162 --> 00:09:51,695
What did he tell you?

50
00:09:54,462 --> 00:09:57,461
Nothing...

51
00:09:57,462 --> 00:10:00,428
that he loves us and...

52
00:10:00,429 --> 00:10:04,261
that you should drive
with your thumbs on the outside.

53
00:10:08,795 --> 00:10:12,628
Did you tell him that we went
to Santiago's house?

54
00:10:22,862 --> 00:10:26,128
Why did you turn off the van?

55
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,861
We are running out of gas.

56
00:10:33,462 --> 00:10:34,961
What happened?

57
00:10:42,629 --> 00:10:44,994
What happened?

58
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:55,627
We got into a fight.

59
00:11:41,262 --> 00:11:42,427
Do you have reception?

60
00:12:04,961 --> 00:12:06,027
Juliana.

61
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:09,160
What?

62
00:12:10,761 --> 00:12:14,860
Do you know why the police
were outside of his house?

63
00:13:09,194 --> 00:13:09,960
Thanks.

64
00:14:07,861 --> 00:14:09,626
Why don't you answer the phone?

65
00:14:09,861 --> 00:14:11,760
What took you so long?

66
00:14:12,261 --> 00:14:14,160
We just missed the 8 AM bus.

67
00:14:14,361 --> 00:14:15,293
How are you?

68
00:14:15,594 --> 00:14:16,660
How are you Julie?

69
00:14:17,527 --> 00:14:19,193
Your parents are giving
a statement to the police.

70
00:14:19,294 --> 00:14:21,126
But you shouldn't be worried.

71
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:22,459
You're going to go to Queretaro...

72
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,859
to Efrén's house...

73
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,359
a friend of your dad and I.

74
00:14:25,594 --> 00:14:27,426
Your dad says to call him
when you get there...

75
00:14:27,494 --> 00:14:29,926
and he will give you directions.

76
00:14:30,294 --> 00:14:32,959
Anyway, I printed you out a few maps...

77
00:14:33,194 --> 00:14:34,759
so you won't have any
trouble getting there.

78
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,659
Julie?

79
00:14:37,827 --> 00:14:39,493
Yes Auntie, I heard you.

80
00:14:49,694 --> 00:14:51,193
Get some sleep dear.

81
00:14:51,694 --> 00:14:53,193
No thanks Auntie.

82
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:56,126
We gotta go.

83
00:15:03,794 --> 00:15:04,959
Open wide.

84
00:15:06,794 --> 00:15:08,126
Wide wide open.

85
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,426
How long have you had that filling?

86
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,292
I got it about a month ago.

87
00:15:17,027 --> 00:15:19,192
It's good that you are
staying so l can fix it.

88
00:15:19,427 --> 00:15:20,159
Auntie...

89
00:15:20,693 --> 00:15:21,959
I have to go with Juliana.

90
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,159
That's what my dad told me.

91
00:15:23,193 --> 00:15:24,359
That I have to take care of her.

92
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,626
Julie?

93
00:15:27,365 --> 00:15:29,359
Julie, what happened?

94
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,959
I broke the mirror. I'll clean it up.

95
00:15:32,027 --> 00:15:32,859
No, don't.

96
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,926
You're going to cut yourself.
Leave it.

97
00:15:34,927 --> 00:15:35,792
Don't worry about it.

98
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,459
The maid will do it.

99
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,526
Are you OK?

100
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,526
I'm all right.

101
00:15:43,027 --> 00:15:44,859
Leave your clothes in the basket.

102
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:46,859
Thanks, but I'm taking them with me.

103
00:15:47,293 --> 00:15:48,992
No, seriously, leave them here.

104
00:15:49,027 --> 00:15:51,159
Don't worry.
I'll keep them for you.

105
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,159
I brought your clothes.

106
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,192
You sure you're OK, Julie?

107
00:15:59,193 --> 00:16:01,859
I'm fine.
Please stop calling me Julie.

108
00:16:09,626 --> 00:16:12,792
Are you sure you don't want
anything else for breakfast, Miwi?

109
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,025
No thanks.

110
00:16:14,193 --> 00:16:15,259
I have eggs...

111
00:16:15,293 --> 00:16:16,359
Auntie...

112
00:16:18,593 --> 00:16:19,692
Please help me.

113
00:16:19,693 --> 00:16:20,925
Julie!

114
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,525
Put your hand here.

115
00:16:40,693 --> 00:16:41,859
Leave it here.

116
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,292
Hang in there.

117
00:16:53,793 --> 00:16:54,825
What happened?

118
00:17:12,626 --> 00:17:13,825
Juliana.

119
00:17:21,093 --> 00:17:23,458
Why do you have a knife?

120
00:17:24,193 --> 00:17:25,925
Miwi stop it, please.

121
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:32,592
Where did you park the van?

122
00:17:32,793 --> 00:17:33,958
Right outside.

123
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:42,758
I won't be able to take
you to the bus station.

124
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:43,758
I'll take her.

125
00:17:45,292 --> 00:17:46,158
Can you drive?

126
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:47,925
You can't drive.

127
00:17:48,126 --> 00:17:49,291
You should've seen her.

128
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,958
Of course she can't drive.

129
00:17:51,026 --> 00:17:53,258
Go to my room and
bring my purse.

130
00:17:54,292 --> 00:17:56,835
I told you to bring my
purse from my room.

131
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:11,398
I think it's best that
you go to Queretaro by car.

132
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,591
Let me see.

133
00:18:20,526 --> 00:18:22,925
I just saw you on the news.

134
00:18:31,626 --> 00:18:32,191
Hello?

135
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:38,858
In Saltillo, I'll explain later.

136
00:18:43,425 --> 00:18:45,958
Hold on, I can't hear you.

137
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:47,458
Hello?

138
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:50,524
Damn.

139
00:18:54,562 --> 00:18:58,609
I don't know what your
father told Efrén...

140
00:18:58,729 --> 00:18:59,812
Give me the keys.

141
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:00,882
What happened?

142
00:19:01,002 --> 00:19:03,002
I'll tell you in a minute.

143
00:19:03,122 --> 00:19:04,226
What are you going to tell her...

144
00:19:04,346 --> 00:19:05,749
if you don't even know what happened?

145
00:19:05,869 --> 00:19:06,839
Give me the keys.

146
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,125
You should stay here with me.

147
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:09,304
I already told you...

148
00:19:09,425 --> 00:19:10,924
either we both leave or
we both stay.

149
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:12,191
Miriana, please listen to me.

150
00:19:12,312 --> 00:19:13,804
Miwi, stay with Auntie.

151
00:19:13,925 --> 00:19:15,858
Give me the keys.

152
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:17,124
No.

153
00:19:17,192 --> 00:19:19,091
I told you that you are
staying here with me.

154
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,491
Give me the keys!

155
00:19:35,192 --> 00:19:37,957
What did they say about Santiago?

156
00:19:39,092 --> 00:19:41,024
That he's not doing well.

157
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:10,857
Sixty.

158
00:20:27,525 --> 00:20:28,490
How much are these?

159
00:20:29,491 --> 00:20:29,857
Three.

160
00:20:30,425 --> 00:20:30,957
Three.

161
00:20:35,591 --> 00:20:36,590
Do you want a bag?

162
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,406
Yes.

163
00:20:51,358 --> 00:20:52,757
Thanks.

164
00:20:55,691 --> 00:20:56,957
Thanks.

165
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,024
What's up baby?

166
00:21:24,024 --> 00:21:25,157
Do you know anyone here...

167
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:28,290
that could lend us some money?

168
00:21:29,524 --> 00:21:31,090
Danny.

169
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:06,423
Straight to voicemail again.

170
00:22:06,424 --> 00:22:07,590
I'm gonna go look for him.

171
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:08,656
OK.

172
00:22:08,691 --> 00:22:10,023
Ask for Dannysaurio.

173
00:22:10,091 --> 00:22:11,490
No one knows him as Daniel.

174
00:22:11,691 --> 00:22:13,923
Don't bring him along Miwi, please.

175
00:22:14,424 --> 00:22:15,690
Just ask him for money.

176
00:22:15,691 --> 00:22:17,523
A thousand pesos.

177
00:22:25,228 --> 00:22:27,352
Miwis, what's up girl?

178
00:22:28,296 --> 00:22:30,679
What's up Danny, how are you?

179
00:22:30,957 --> 00:22:32,359
You should've called me.

180
00:22:32,724 --> 00:22:34,190
I did, but you never answered.

181
00:22:34,357 --> 00:22:34,623
Really?

182
00:22:34,757 --> 00:22:35,256
Yup.

183
00:22:35,524 --> 00:22:37,823
I need a favor.

184
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,790
We need some money.

185
00:22:41,857 --> 00:22:43,856
Did you come with someone?

186
00:22:45,491 --> 00:22:46,790
Julie!

187
00:22:47,357 --> 00:22:48,923
How have you been?

188
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,623
This job is killing me.

189
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:00,856
What's up?

190
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:01,956
Danny...

191
00:23:01,957 --> 00:23:03,323
the money.

192
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:07,589
Always the damn money.

193
00:23:10,357 --> 00:23:11,589
OK.

194
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:15,689
Let's see how much we have.

195
00:23:17,457 --> 00:23:20,189
You're going to bankrupt me.

196
00:23:21,857 --> 00:23:23,856
What can we do?

197
00:23:25,024 --> 00:23:27,456
I am sorry, I would love
to help you, but...

198
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:30,989
I'll end up asking
my mom for money again.

199
00:23:31,357 --> 00:23:33,256
No worries.
Thanks Danny.

200
00:23:33,624 --> 00:23:35,156
No, no. Wait.

201
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:39,489
I can get a thousand pesos in no time.

202
00:23:39,757 --> 00:23:40,989
What should we do?

203
00:23:41,523 --> 00:23:43,256
Let's call Buki.

204
00:23:43,623 --> 00:23:45,856
Remember him?

205
00:23:46,957 --> 00:23:49,322
Buki! My friend.

206
00:23:49,757 --> 00:23:51,689
A skinny guy that became a rocker.

207
00:23:51,857 --> 00:23:54,322
And he'll lend you money?

208
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,289
Pardo!

209
00:24:04,713 --> 00:24:06,273
What's up dude?

210
00:24:06,393 --> 00:24:07,898
Hey, do you know where Buki is?

211
00:24:08,124 --> 00:24:10,304
I'm looking for him.

212
00:24:10,681 --> 00:24:12,171
Yeah, dude. I need some cash.

213
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:15,710
You too?
Welcome to the club.

214
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,405
No, seriously can you
lend me something?

215
00:24:18,525 --> 00:24:20,030
Anything?

216
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:39,789
Is that Buki?

217
00:24:40,023 --> 00:24:41,089
No, that's not Buki.

218
00:24:41,456 --> 00:24:43,422
I don't know who that is.

219
00:24:45,356 --> 00:24:47,355
Actually, Buki's late.

220
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:52,155
Are you sure this is
the only way in?

221
00:24:52,356 --> 00:24:53,989
Yes, it's the only one.

222
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:01,489
I think we should leave.

223
00:25:01,956 --> 00:25:04,122
This guy's not coming.

224
00:25:04,756 --> 00:25:06,989
He said he'd be here an hour ago.

225
00:25:08,856 --> 00:25:10,355
Actually if you're going to Queretaro...

226
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,822
leave me at Real de Catorce.

227
00:25:12,023 --> 00:25:12,622
No, Danny.

228
00:25:12,923 --> 00:25:13,789
I'll give you my money.

229
00:25:13,923 --> 00:25:15,155
How much?

230
00:25:15,356 --> 00:25:16,355
About four hundred pesos.

231
00:25:16,423 --> 00:25:17,689
Let me see.

232
00:25:25,856 --> 00:25:27,855
I don't get why you're
going to Queretaro.

233
00:25:28,023 --> 00:25:30,655
Wouldn't you like to go to
Real de Catorce?

234
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:33,622
We've planned this trip for
ages and we never do it.

235
00:25:34,189 --> 00:25:36,022
We can bring the van.

236
00:25:36,023 --> 00:25:38,088
We go down to the desert...

237
00:25:38,089 --> 00:25:40,488
where the peyote is.

238
00:25:41,189 --> 00:25:42,688
We camp there with the people...

239
00:25:42,756 --> 00:25:44,288
there's always people down there.

240
00:25:45,123 --> 00:25:46,688
In Real you need less
money the in Querétaro...

241
00:25:46,689 --> 00:25:48,788
I don't know what are you
going to do there...

242
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:51,488
But we don't need that much money.

243
00:25:51,523 --> 00:25:54,588
What we have will do.

244
00:25:56,023 --> 00:25:58,288
I only have phone cards for 200 pesos.

245
00:25:58,289 --> 00:25:59,422
Is that okay?

246
00:25:59,423 --> 00:26:00,288
OK

247
00:26:05,023 --> 00:26:05,922
Here.

248
00:26:07,364 --> 00:26:08,363
It's 200.

249
00:26:08,923 --> 00:26:09,588
Thanks.

250
00:26:15,181 --> 00:26:16,813
Can I borrow a coin?

251
00:26:17,521 --> 00:26:18,620
Thanks.

252
00:26:26,689 --> 00:26:31,455
"Attacks boyfriend and kills child."

253
00:26:34,856 --> 00:26:36,088
Do you need anything else?

254
00:26:36,356 --> 00:26:37,788
No, thanks.

255
00:26:39,856 --> 00:26:40,688
Good afternoon.

256
00:26:40,956 --> 00:26:41,988
Good afternoon.

257
00:26:42,089 --> 00:26:42,855
Anything else?

258
00:26:42,856 --> 00:26:43,788
No.

259
00:27:30,355 --> 00:27:31,754
Girls...

260
00:27:33,589 --> 00:27:35,821
this is Danny The Freakasaurus.

261
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:39,421
My friends and colleagues...

262
00:27:39,522 --> 00:27:41,454
call me “the dannysaurius".

263
00:27:41,522 --> 00:27:43,754
In this rap thing...

264
00:27:43,989 --> 00:27:46,988
l don't have any adversaries.

265
00:27:47,255 --> 00:27:49,521
My flow keeps living on word of mouth.

266
00:27:49,689 --> 00:27:52,854
Just feel it. Don't ask for an explanation.

267
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:56,051
Smoke these rhymes.

268
00:27:56,171 --> 00:27:58,637
Especially dedicated to my cousins.

269
00:27:58,757 --> 00:28:01,418
Miwi and Juliana...

270
00:28:01,538 --> 00:28:03,340
I love them like my sisters.

271
00:28:03,461 --> 00:28:04,566
We continue to rhyme.

272
00:28:06,755 --> 00:28:08,154
Typical.

273
00:28:08,755 --> 00:28:10,454
Fucking people.

274
00:28:11,088 --> 00:28:14,348
You and me, we should
start a band together Miwi.

275
00:28:20,455 --> 00:28:22,287
What's with her?

276
00:28:23,022 --> 00:28:24,621
Juliana...

277
00:28:26,122 --> 00:28:27,587
Juliana!

278
00:28:29,522 --> 00:28:30,354
Juliana!

279
00:29:10,966 --> 00:29:12,512
Juliana.

280
00:29:31,621 --> 00:29:32,620
Want to hear my demo?

281
00:29:34,088 --> 00:29:35,653
Hand it to me, Miwi

282
00:29:35,654 --> 00:29:37,020
it's in the briefcase.

283
00:29:42,321 --> 00:29:43,153
Give it to me.

284
00:29:43,588 --> 00:29:44,753
No, just the CD case.

285
00:29:44,754 --> 00:29:46,453
Play the CD and give me the case.

286
00:29:47,754 --> 00:29:49,253
I recorded this one at home...

287
00:29:50,254 --> 00:29:51,587
with my laptop and a guitar.

288
00:29:54,288 --> 00:29:56,020
Then if you get some money...

289
00:29:56,321 --> 00:29:57,653
you go to a studio...

290
00:29:57,654 --> 00:29:59,987
get it remastered but...

291
00:30:01,121 --> 00:30:04,120
you can start by doing it at home.

292
00:30:04,921 --> 00:30:05,620
Did you find it?

293
00:30:06,421 --> 00:30:06,996
Yes.

294
00:30:07,454 --> 00:30:08,120
Give me the case.

295
00:30:08,121 --> 00:30:10,587
I want to show something to Julie.

296
00:30:10,921 --> 00:30:12,487
Julie, check this out:

297
00:30:12,488 --> 00:30:13,987
Danny the Freakasaurus.

298
00:30:21,121 --> 00:30:22,787
Play track two.

299
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:25,586
This will lighten you up a little, Julie.

300
00:30:26,121 --> 00:30:27,153
Miwi...

301
00:30:27,954 --> 00:30:29,853
Please turn down the volume.

302
00:30:33,654 --> 00:30:34,586
Miwi.

303
00:30:39,454 --> 00:30:42,086
Remember I told you about CJ?

304
00:30:42,254 --> 00:30:44,253
You know him right?

305
00:30:44,621 --> 00:30:47,820
CJ is my supervisor at the call center.

306
00:30:48,487 --> 00:30:51,586
It's tough to get a
hundred and ten, with him.

307
00:30:52,121 --> 00:30:54,320
Because it's not a hundred,
it's a hundred and ten.

308
00:30:54,321 --> 00:30:56,686
It's motivational bullshit.

309
00:30:57,087 --> 00:31:00,520
Danny, you know what, make a U-turn here.

310
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:06,286
Oh I'm sorry, I thought
this was the freeway.

311
00:31:06,854 --> 00:31:07,686
Turn around.

312
00:31:07,687 --> 00:31:08,620
Really?

313
00:31:08,654 --> 00:31:10,320
No, no. Keep straight.

314
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:13,186
Damn it, Danny. Why did
you come this way?

315
00:31:13,187 --> 00:31:15,186
I'm sorry Julie, I fucked up.

316
00:31:15,854 --> 00:31:16,586
Relax.

317
00:31:24,087 --> 00:31:24,753
Buki.

318
00:31:26,087 --> 00:31:28,153
Dude, I've been calling you.

319
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,619
Danny.

320
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,619
Hang up.

321
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,986
It's just Buki, Julie.

322
00:31:32,654 --> 00:31:34,319
Yes, we are on the road...

323
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,286
on our way to Real.

324
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,519
Where are you watching that, man?

325
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,619
Hang up!

326
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,819
Yes, I'm with my cousins.

327
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,919
Hang up!

328
00:31:42,254 --> 00:31:43,353
Wear this.

329
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,286
What are you talking about?

330
00:31:45,287 --> 00:31:46,819
Danny, hang up!

331
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,753
Keep driving.

332
00:31:56,487 --> 00:31:57,519
Calm down.

333
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,119
Thanks.

334
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,986
I told you not to bring him.

335
00:32:50,987 --> 00:32:52,319
Relax, ok?

336
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,486
I told you.

337
00:32:53,487 --> 00:32:54,819
Shut up.

338
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:51,585
Are you alone?

339
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:54,652
You sure?

340
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:59,685
Ok. Yes. I am with Juliana.

341
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:02,118
No.

342
00:34:03,619 --> 00:34:05,285
She didn't do it.

343
00:34:06,619 --> 00:34:09,452
No, but I'm sure she didn't do it.

344
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:13,752
Yes. I promise.

345
00:34:15,419 --> 00:34:16,485
I gotta go.

346
00:34:23,786 --> 00:34:25,618
Will you send me texts?

347
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:29,785
Will you send me kisses?

348
00:34:35,986 --> 00:34:37,752
Do you know that your
cellphones can be traced?

349
00:34:39,586 --> 00:34:40,251
How?

350
00:34:43,086 --> 00:34:44,251
They go to the cellphone company

351
00:34:44,319 --> 00:34:46,151
with a warrant that says

352
00:34:46,152 --> 00:34:47,685
they need to track your cellphone...

353
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:49,318
and that's it.

354
00:34:49,319 --> 00:34:52,118
You don't even have
to be making calls.

355
00:34:52,486 --> 00:34:54,151
How do you know that?

356
00:34:54,586 --> 00:34:56,751
My job.

357
00:34:59,619 --> 00:35:01,985
My cellphone is off anyway.

358
00:35:23,152 --> 00:35:28,018
What did one Campbell's
soup say to the other?

359
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:33,484
Let's smile while we can.

360
00:35:51,952 --> 00:35:53,484
Keep my demo.

361
00:35:53,919 --> 00:35:55,818
Danny the Freakasaurus.

362
00:35:56,319 --> 00:35:58,481
Tell Julie she'll like the last song.

363
00:35:58,684 --> 00:35:59,559
OK?

364
00:36:14,485 --> 00:36:17,918
"The Beast roams free".

365
00:37:14,118 --> 00:37:17,484
I told you not to leave the van.

366
00:37:19,751 --> 00:37:22,684
We have to find a cyber café.

367
00:37:23,285 --> 00:37:25,350
You're an idiot Juliana.

368
00:37:41,485 --> 00:37:43,684
You're an idiot!

369
00:37:44,185 --> 00:37:46,117
Stop it!

370
00:37:54,418 --> 00:37:55,584
Excuse me.

371
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,184
I'll be in the van.

372
00:38:45,751 --> 00:38:48,583
Santiago and I made an oath

373
00:38:51,651 --> 00:38:54,083
That we would never leave each other.

374
00:38:54,617 --> 00:38:56,016
Look.

375
00:39:02,917 --> 00:39:04,750
We made a pact.

376
00:39:27,984 --> 00:39:30,516
Hey, I've tried calling several times...

377
00:39:30,584 --> 00:39:33,150
but no one answers...

378
00:39:33,251 --> 00:39:35,616
and I have 16 missed calls from Dad.

379
00:41:14,983 --> 00:41:17,482
The unfortunate news reveal...

380
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:20,116
that the young man has just died.

381
00:41:20,117 --> 00:41:22,782
The state authorities confirmed...

382
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,749
the death of Santiago Villanueva.

383
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:27,249
They have announced
a multiple police operation...

384
00:41:27,283 --> 00:41:29,149
to catch the young killer...

385
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:31,015
Juliana Martinez Garza.

386
00:41:31,016 --> 00:41:32,682
So it's a double homicide.

387
00:41:33,316 --> 00:41:34,949
How sad.

388
00:41:35,516 --> 00:41:38,449
It's so sad, what's
happening in Monterrey...

389
00:41:56,292 --> 00:41:58,125
Help me, please.

390
00:42:10,616 --> 00:42:11,982
What's wrong?

391
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:18,948
Can't you blame Santiago?

392
00:42:20,558 --> 00:42:21,224
No.

393
00:42:22,783 --> 00:42:24,315
What about you?

394
00:42:25,583 --> 00:42:27,248
I can take care of myself.

395
00:43:26,816 --> 00:43:27,948
Excuse me...

396
00:43:27,949 --> 00:43:29,148
do you know what happened?

397
00:43:29,149 --> 00:43:30,315
An accident.

398
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:31,481
How far is it?

399
00:43:31,982 --> 00:43:33,848
Walking, about two hours.

400
00:43:34,516 --> 00:43:35,681
Driving...

401
00:43:36,349 --> 00:43:37,448
the same.

402
00:46:35,914 --> 00:46:37,113
Miwi.

403
00:47:36,314 --> 00:47:37,980
What would you like to drink?

404
00:47:37,981 --> 00:47:38,813
I have...

405
00:47:38,847 --> 00:47:40,346
lemonade, milk...

406
00:47:41,014 --> 00:47:42,013
water...

407
00:47:43,147 --> 00:47:44,146
Water, please.

408
00:47:44,181 --> 00:47:44,913
Milk.

409
00:47:45,781 --> 00:47:46,480
Water...

410
00:47:49,447 --> 00:47:50,513
Let's see.

411
00:47:55,947 --> 00:47:57,913
What happened to your hand?

412
00:47:59,514 --> 00:48:00,446
I cut myself.

413
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:05,246
Water.

414
00:48:05,847 --> 00:48:06,846
That's fine.

415
00:48:08,347 --> 00:48:10,080
And milk.

416
00:48:11,814 --> 00:48:12,746
Thank you.

417
00:48:13,447 --> 00:48:14,279
I'll leave it here...

418
00:48:14,614 --> 00:48:16,013
if you want some more.

419
00:48:19,447 --> 00:48:21,446
Did you tell anyone else...

420
00:48:21,447 --> 00:48:22,779
you were coming here?

421
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:24,113
No.

422
00:48:24,114 --> 00:48:25,979
Just my dad.

423
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:28,513
Who gave you my address?

424
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:29,746
My aunt.

425
00:48:30,447 --> 00:48:30,979
Your aunt...

426
00:48:31,014 --> 00:48:32,079
which aunt?

427
00:48:32,114 --> 00:48:33,113
Bea.

428
00:48:34,014 --> 00:48:36,279
I remember Bea.

429
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,313
How is she...?

430
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:39,579
Fine.

431
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:40,996
I'm glad.

432
00:48:41,514 --> 00:48:42,679
What a blessing that Bea.

433
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:46,346
Do you have a computer
that I could use?

434
00:48:46,614 --> 00:48:47,346
I am sorry?

435
00:48:47,347 --> 00:48:48,446
A computer...

436
00:48:48,647 --> 00:48:49,179
Sure...

437
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,313
Do you need Internet?

438
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:52,479
Sorry dear...

439
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,813
it crashed this morning.

440
00:48:59,347 --> 00:49:01,513
Watch out, it's hot.

441
00:49:01,614 --> 00:49:02,613
Thanks.

442
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:03,979
So...

443
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:07,679
Besides Bea and your dad...

444
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,179
who else knows you're here?

445
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:15,179
No one.

446
00:49:15,813 --> 00:49:17,146
The thing is that...

447
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:19,246
we haven't talked with my dad.

448
00:49:19,613 --> 00:49:21,446
I spoke with him two hours ago.

449
00:49:21,567 --> 00:49:24,232
I thought you weren't coming.

450
00:49:24,813 --> 00:49:26,579
Sorry for arriving so late.

451
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,146
Nevermind.

452
00:49:28,147 --> 00:49:30,512
Was it difficult to find the place?

453
00:49:31,447 --> 00:49:33,079
A little.

454
00:49:36,013 --> 00:49:38,446
Can I use your bathroom, please?

455
00:49:38,613 --> 00:49:39,679
Sure.

456
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:40,946
Actually, I'll go with you.

457
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:42,079
The knob is broken.

458
00:49:42,113 --> 00:49:43,612
I don't want you to get locked in.

459
00:49:43,613 --> 00:49:45,512
Come with me.

460
00:50:18,946 --> 00:50:19,479
Hi.

461
00:50:29,946 --> 00:50:31,679
Noé, what are you doing here?

462
00:50:32,013 --> 00:50:33,679
I came for a glass of water.

463
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,745
Go to your room right now.

464
00:50:40,813 --> 00:50:42,812
Take the cat with you.

465
00:50:49,779 --> 00:50:50,612
Hey kitty.

466
00:50:50,613 --> 00:50:52,145
Let me see him.

467
00:50:53,113 --> 00:50:54,312
Hi kitty.

468
00:50:54,679 --> 00:50:55,945
I am talking to you Noé.

469
00:50:55,979 --> 00:50:56,912
What's his name?

470
00:50:56,946 --> 00:50:57,512
Bernardo.

471
00:50:57,846 --> 00:50:58,945
Bernardo!

472
00:50:59,513 --> 00:51:00,178
Noé!

473
00:51:00,613 --> 00:51:01,278
I'm going.

474
00:51:01,279 --> 00:51:02,278
Bye.

475
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:10,478
Sweetheart, you can finish
your dinner in the guest room.

476
00:51:10,479 --> 00:51:12,745
That's where you'll stay.

477
00:51:14,179 --> 00:51:15,845
Are you going to help us?

478
00:51:17,346 --> 00:51:18,345
Help you how?

479
00:51:20,779 --> 00:51:22,345
We need money.

480
00:51:23,279 --> 00:51:25,312
How much money do you need?

481
00:51:26,179 --> 00:51:27,845
About five thousand pesos.

482
00:51:28,479 --> 00:51:31,245
Five thousand pesos.

483
00:51:32,813 --> 00:51:34,845
There is nothing
I can do right now.

484
00:51:34,946 --> 00:51:36,345
Why don't you
get some rest...

485
00:51:36,346 --> 00:51:38,978
and we can talk
about this tomorrow?

486
00:51:39,112 --> 00:51:41,478
Bring your dinner with you.

487
00:51:42,679 --> 00:51:43,345
Thanks.

488
00:51:43,846 --> 00:51:45,011
This way.

489
00:51:51,479 --> 00:51:52,645
Why don't you throw it away?

490
00:51:54,579 --> 00:51:55,478
It freaks me out...

491
00:51:55,479 --> 00:51:57,311
that you still carry it.

492
00:51:57,412 --> 00:51:58,311
I am going to throw it away.

493
00:51:58,312 --> 00:51:59,778
But not here.

494
00:52:05,579 --> 00:52:06,645
Come here.

495
00:52:14,312 --> 00:52:16,178
Juliana, come over here.

496
00:52:26,146 --> 00:52:27,311
C'mon.

497
00:52:45,279 --> 00:52:47,111
Let's find a cyber café tomorrow.

498
00:52:47,245 --> 00:52:48,311
What for?

499
00:52:48,512 --> 00:52:50,744
I want to know if mom and dad wrote and...

500
00:52:50,912 --> 00:52:53,778
see how Santiago's doing.

501
00:53:04,845 --> 00:53:05,611
Wake up!

502
00:53:05,645 --> 00:53:07,144
You have to go.

503
00:53:08,145 --> 00:53:09,311
Why?
What happened?

504
00:53:09,345 --> 00:53:10,344
They're coming for you.

505
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:11,311
Who?

506
00:53:12,112 --> 00:53:13,411
The police.

507
00:53:15,979 --> 00:53:17,144
Go down by the vacant lot...

508
00:53:17,145 --> 00:53:18,144
and then turn right...

509
00:53:18,145 --> 00:53:19,511
Two blocks ahead

510
00:53:19,512 --> 00:53:21,077
there's an abandoned house.

511
00:53:21,078 --> 00:53:22,177
You can stay there.

512
00:57:42,477 --> 00:57:43,742
There's none here either?

513
00:57:43,777 --> 00:57:44,676
No.

514
00:57:56,643 --> 00:57:58,409
I'm going to the van.

515
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:01,142
No.

516
00:58:04,477 --> 00:58:05,909
What for?

517
00:58:06,777 --> 00:58:08,109
I don't know.

518
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:14,242
No.

519
00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:18,476
Why not?

520
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:24,409
They might be watching
it or something...

521
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:27,909
it's probably not even there.

522
00:58:30,943 --> 00:58:31,675
Right.

523
00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:39,975
I am really thirsty
and hungry.

524
00:59:12,443 --> 00:59:16,342
We should have gone to Real with Danny.

525
00:59:52,343 --> 00:59:54,508
Does anyone else know
that you came here?

526
00:59:55,109 --> 00:59:55,775
No

527
00:59:55,809 --> 00:59:58,142
Just me and Elias.

528
00:59:58,143 --> 00:59:59,508
He's my cousin.

529
00:59:59,509 --> 01:00:00,242
What's up.

530
01:00:01,343 --> 01:00:02,575
I'm Noé.

531
01:00:03,609 --> 01:00:04,775
Miriana.

532
01:00:05,509 --> 01:00:06,675
That's a pretty name.

533
01:00:13,942 --> 01:00:16,775
Is there a place with
internet around here?

534
01:00:17,342 --> 01:00:19,508
I could bring you a
cellphone with Internet.

535
01:00:19,942 --> 01:00:21,275
Can you bring it later?

536
01:00:21,809 --> 01:00:24,475
Sure I'll bring it at night.

537
01:00:25,509 --> 01:00:26,441
Thanks.

538
01:00:56,442 --> 01:00:57,641
Delete it.

539
01:00:58,475 --> 01:00:59,574
But they're mine.

540
01:00:59,609 --> 01:01:01,141
Please delete it.

541
01:01:02,809 --> 01:01:04,008
What happened?

542
01:01:04,609 --> 01:01:05,608
He took a picture.

543
01:01:08,942 --> 01:01:10,174
Let me see.

544
01:01:39,775 --> 01:01:41,808
You erased them all.

545
01:01:47,942 --> 01:01:49,441
Miwi, let's go.

546
01:04:16,941 --> 01:04:17,940
I can make them bigger.

547
01:04:17,941 --> 01:04:18,607
Let's see.

548
01:04:31,507 --> 01:04:33,173
Do you have a boyfriend Miwi?

549
01:04:34,941 --> 01:04:35,506
No.

550
01:04:37,141 --> 01:04:38,173
Miriana.

551
01:04:38,807 --> 01:04:39,640
Look at me.

552
01:04:39,674 --> 01:04:40,673
Do you have a boyfriend?

553
01:04:41,641 --> 01:04:42,473
No.

554
01:04:45,107 --> 01:04:47,440
Why you are smiling then?

555
01:04:48,441 --> 01:04:49,640
Come on, tell me.

556
01:04:51,441 --> 01:04:52,606
I don't have a boyfriend!

557
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:56,473
That's it!

558
01:04:56,507 --> 01:04:59,306
Your laughter gives you away.

559
01:05:00,174 --> 01:05:01,673
What do you want me to tell you?

560
01:05:02,107 --> 01:05:03,506
What's his name?

561
01:05:03,607 --> 01:05:05,340
How did you meet him?

562
01:05:05,507 --> 01:05:07,106
What do you like about him?

563
01:05:07,141 --> 01:05:08,906
What does he do?

564
01:05:08,941 --> 01:05:09,806
Fine.

565
01:05:10,441 --> 01:05:11,939
So you do have a boyfriend.

566
01:05:12,674 --> 01:05:13,506
Yes.

567
01:05:16,307 --> 01:05:17,306
What's his name?

568
01:05:18,507 --> 01:05:20,139
Jorge Bernardo.

569
01:05:20,774 --> 01:05:22,473
Jorge Bernardo Vargas.

570
01:05:23,107 --> 01:05:23,939
What?

571
01:05:24,107 --> 01:05:24,506
No?

572
01:05:27,138 --> 01:05:27,886
No.

573
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:29,973
OK. his name is Kyzza.

574
01:05:30,274 --> 01:05:30,973
C'mon...

575
01:05:30,974 --> 01:05:31,973
That name doesn't even exist.

576
01:05:32,007 --> 01:05:32,939
You just made it up.

577
01:05:32,974 --> 01:05:33,806
I am serious.

578
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:34,506
Yes..

579
01:05:34,607 --> 01:05:35,806
OK, his name is Kyzza.

580
01:05:37,107 --> 01:05:37,673
OK.

581
01:05:39,274 --> 01:05:40,773
OK so...

582
01:05:43,274 --> 01:05:45,106
I met him at a party...

583
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:48,306
of a friend from school.

584
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:50,739
And...

585
01:05:52,274 --> 01:05:53,473
and the party was cool.

586
01:05:53,607 --> 01:05:54,473
So I was there...

587
01:05:54,507 --> 01:05:55,939
hanging out...

588
01:05:56,774 --> 01:05:58,339
chatting...

589
01:05:59,007 --> 01:06:00,806
when he came over...

590
01:06:01,174 --> 01:06:02,839
and he started talking to me..

591
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:05,272
And he sat next to me and we talked.

592
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:08,472
He told me about what he does.

593
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:09,672
What does he do?

594
01:06:09,673 --> 01:06:10,839
Well...

595
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:14,506
he's in a band.

596
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:15,406
A punk band.

597
01:06:15,807 --> 01:06:17,139
So, he's punk.

598
01:06:19,773 --> 01:06:21,506
What does he play?

599
01:06:21,507 --> 01:06:22,606
He plays an instrument.

600
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:23,139
Which one?

601
01:06:23,173 --> 01:06:24,406
The guitar.

602
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:27,172
And...

603
01:06:27,273 --> 01:06:30,506
He was telling me this and that...

604
01:06:31,007 --> 01:06:34,439
Then he offered me a beer.

605
01:06:35,473 --> 01:06:36,506
And what did you say?

606
01:06:36,607 --> 01:06:38,806
"No thanks, I don't drink."

607
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:41,272
And well...

608
01:06:41,807 --> 01:06:44,739
he convinced me so I had one drink.

609
01:06:45,273 --> 01:06:47,606
You fell into his trap.

610
01:06:48,107 --> 01:06:50,272
I didn't!

611
01:06:50,773 --> 01:06:52,139
And then...

612
01:06:53,140 --> 01:06:55,805
And then he said,
"Do you want to dance?”

613
01:06:57,173 --> 01:06:59,905
And we danced...

614
01:07:02,273 --> 01:07:03,272
It's true!

615
01:07:04,106 --> 01:07:06,505
I thought he was a punk!

616
01:07:06,773 --> 01:07:09,672
He is a punk and a danger

617
01:07:09,773 --> 01:07:11,305
What were you dancing?

618
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:13,405
Just to the song.

619
01:07:14,473 --> 01:07:15,472
And then...

620
01:07:16,673 --> 01:07:19,072
he kissed me.

621
01:07:19,273 --> 01:07:20,105
He kissed you?

622
01:07:20,106 --> 01:07:21,005
Yes.

623
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:22,272
Dancing?

624
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:23,939
Yes.

625
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:26,639
Cute?

626
01:07:27,273 --> 01:07:28,605
A kiss on the dance floor.

627
01:07:28,773 --> 01:07:30,472
A dancing kiss.

628
01:07:34,273 --> 01:07:34,972
And that's it...

629
01:07:35,006 --> 01:07:36,672
that's my story.

630
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:39,505
And with that kiss...

631
01:07:39,606 --> 01:07:40,805
he swept you off your feet.

632
01:07:40,806 --> 01:07:41,572
Yes.

633
01:07:43,273 --> 01:07:44,272
And we have been together...

634
01:07:44,273 --> 01:07:45,605
for about two weeks.

635
01:07:46,439 --> 01:07:47,605
Two weeks?

636
01:07:47,773 --> 01:07:48,605
Yeah.

637
01:07:54,339 --> 01:07:56,005
Sweet.

638
01:07:59,673 --> 01:08:02,238
Why didn't you tell me?

639
01:08:03,806 --> 01:08:05,505
I don't know.

640
01:09:14,972 --> 01:09:16,305
What are you doing Miwi?

641
01:09:18,972 --> 01:09:20,438
Let me see.

642
01:09:23,139 --> 01:09:23,971
Miwi.

643
01:09:25,139 --> 01:09:26,571
What's wrong with you?

644
01:09:32,272 --> 01:09:33,838
Give it to me.

645
01:09:47,939 --> 01:09:49,504
I wanted to tell you.

646
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:10,238
I heard it on the radio.

647
01:11:12,771 --> 01:11:13,937
Dad wrote.

648
01:11:25,505 --> 01:11:27,837
He said that everything's
gotten out of control...

649
01:11:28,138 --> 01:11:30,670
that I should turn myself in.

650
01:11:46,805 --> 01:11:48,804
Danny also wrote me.

651
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:52,404
What did he say?

652
01:11:55,271 --> 01:11:58,970
He asked me if I liked the song.

653
01:12:08,604 --> 01:12:11,303
When I was in sixth grade,
I met Santiago.

654
01:12:11,735 --> 01:12:14,137
But he was in junior
high school.

655
01:12:14,641 --> 01:12:17,243
Actually, I didn't know
him because...

656
01:12:17,364 --> 01:12:20,137
I only saw him when he was
training or at games.

657
01:12:20,138 --> 01:12:23,937
He was the goalkeeper of the
football team.

658
01:12:28,104 --> 01:12:30,103
Then l didn't see
him for a long time...

659
01:12:30,104 --> 01:12:32,137
because he graduated...

660
01:12:32,171 --> 01:12:33,670
and that was it...

661
01:12:34,271 --> 01:12:35,303
he went away.

662
01:12:36,438 --> 01:12:37,770
I was very sad.

663
01:12:38,971 --> 01:12:40,903
I stopped eating for a few days.

664
01:12:41,004 --> 01:12:42,237
I remember it so well.

665
01:12:44,438 --> 01:12:46,103
And then,

666
01:12:46,138 --> 01:12:47,303
two years ago...

667
01:12:49,171 --> 01:12:51,336
l saw him at a Halloween party.

668
01:12:52,271 --> 01:12:55,403
Neither of us had costumes on.

669
01:12:58,804 --> 01:13:01,403
Suddenly somebody poked me...

670
01:13:01,437 --> 01:13:03,936
I turned around and he said "Julie"!

671
01:13:03,937 --> 01:13:05,636
I was like...

672
01:13:05,671 --> 01:13:06,336
"Who are you?”

673
01:13:06,437 --> 01:13:08,503
"Santiago, don't you
remember me?”

674
01:13:09,837 --> 01:13:11,670
And I was like, "No."

675
01:13:13,971 --> 01:13:15,803
Obviously I did.

676
01:13:18,337 --> 01:13:19,936
And he said...

677
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:21,817
"I do".

678
01:13:21,937 --> 01:13:25,270
"I have been waiting all
these years for you to grow up.”

679
01:13:48,604 --> 01:13:50,336
Can you play this CD?

680
01:13:59,604 --> 01:14:01,603
Play the last song, please.

681
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:42,602
Thanks.

682
01:15:42,603 --> 01:15:43,935
You're welcome.

683
01:16:08,670 --> 01:16:10,169
Noé had like a crush
on you, right?

684
01:16:10,970 --> 01:16:12,135
Shut up.

685
01:16:19,903 --> 01:16:22,068
Do you recognize it yet?

686
01:16:23,303 --> 01:16:24,735
No.

687
01:16:29,469 --> 01:16:31,435
It's behind the mountain.

688
01:16:42,336 --> 01:16:44,135
I can't see anything.

689
01:18:01,266 --> 01:18:03,266
I'm going to bury the knife.

690
01:18:05,935 --> 01:18:08,334
Can you wait for me near
the cabins?

691
01:18:10,124 --> 01:18:11,035
Ok.

692
01:18:16,302 --> 01:18:17,901
Stay there.

693
01:18:33,435 --> 01:18:35,134
Wait for me.
