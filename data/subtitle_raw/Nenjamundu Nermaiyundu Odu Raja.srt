00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,240
Nothing, sir.
I am normal.

173
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,440
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

174
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,480
You have any idea who he is?

175
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,080
I'm warning you,
leave him alone...

176
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,800
- I will--
- Calm down! Stop yelling.

177
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,840
- You came to kill this man, right?
- What? Me?

178
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,200
Why are you getting agitated?

179
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,440
- You're going to make me stab him.
- You're doing one mistake after another...

180
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,400
Shut up.

181
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,920
Everyone, please listen
to what I am going to say.

182
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,360
If any of you...

183
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,120
He makes me hold an old man
and he grabs that gorgeous girl?

184
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,760
Just let him go.

185
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,040
Or, I'll kill her.

186
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,400
Why would you kill me
for that man?

187
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,880
Shut up,
I'll bite your ears off.

188
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,320
You want to play it that way?

189
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,440
If you kill her,
I will kill this man.

190
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,680
Sir, please!

191
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,400
I don't even know
who this man is.

192
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,680
Sir, let me go.
Please! Please! Please!

193
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,280
Quit nagging.

194
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,520
Take your hand off her waist.

195
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,800
Why? You can hold his waist
if you'd like!

196
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,960
Just take your hands
off her waist.

197
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,880
I won't!

198
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,040
Don't cheat, buddy!
Get your hands off.

199
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,040
Don't talk unnecessarily...

200
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,680
Sir, please I beg you.
Let me go.

201
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,040
Sir, please!
Let me go.

202
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,120
Sir?

203
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,640
Please! Please!
Please! Please!

204
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,880
- Please, sir!
- Hello?

205
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,280
She is your co-hostage, isn't she?
Look how she is begging for her life.

206
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,160
Why are you just standing there
like it's a college viva.

207
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,040
I saw the camera.

208
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,440
Camera?

209
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,520
Impossible!
Our cameraman...

210
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,080
Sarath?

211
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,760
Yes, sir?

212
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,280
- What are you doing?
- I am hiding, sir!

213
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,680
- Come again?
- I'm hiding, brother.

214
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,280
- No one saw you, right?
- Not at all!

215
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,040
- Let's roll the camera?
- Sure! Rolling, action!

216
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,400
I'll whack you!

217
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,120
Sir, we were doing it for kicks!

218
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,280
Be a sport and
say, 'We're doing fun!'

219
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,640
It's a prank, sir.

220
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,280
'We're doing fun?'
You dare play a prank?

221
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,280
You--!

222
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,160
What were you thinking?
What do we look like to you?

223
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,560
When you put a knife to our necks,
we're supposed to get scared.

224
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,840
Finally when you say it's a prank,
we're supposed to smile for the camera?

225
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,320
A reporter?

226
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,680
If I call the cops, they'll lock you up
under public nuisance for 5 years.

227
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,640
I'll call them?

228
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,200
No, please don't.

229
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,800
The next time I see you in Chennai
with a camera, you're done for!

230
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,160
Rascals.

231
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,600
Tell them to disperse.

232
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,240
Get going, everyone.
Leave!

233
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,280
Boys...

234
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,040
You're one of those people
who make videos for YouTube?

235
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,880
Yes, sir.

236
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,520
You're putting a knife to my neck
in front of such a big crowd...

237
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,480
What if someone from the crowd
stepped forward and beat you up?

238
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,760
Sir, don't humour me.

239
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:09,000
Who would dare come close
when I hold a knife to your neck?

240
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,720
Even that girl was scared
when she had that knife to her neck.

241
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,520
Only after she knew it was a prank
did she slap my friend.

242
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,680
So...

243
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,320
In front of such a large crowd...

244
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,360
A girl just slapped you.
You didn't feel like slapping her back?

245
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,840
Oh, right.

246
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,080
If I slap her back
in return...

247
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,360
She'd slap me again.
I'll hit her back.

248
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,720
Is this what revenge is?

249
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,280
The courage she gathered to slap me...
I need to break that courage.

250
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,640
She should only feel fear
when she tries to hit me again.

251
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,480
Instilling that fear is true revenge.

252
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,720
Wow!

253
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,480
- Oh yes...
- Sir!

254
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,640
Sir! Sir!

255
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,080
Aren't you 'Prank Star' Siva?

256
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,960
Sir, I'm your biggest fan.

257
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,520
During the Gaja Cyclone,
you helped the Delta Region people...

258
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,400
and raised money
by donating both your kidneys!

259
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,440
You're god, sir.

260
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,560
- I'll fall at your feet.
- To handle any potential problems...

261
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,960
we set-up these men and...

262
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,560
- Sir?
- Go!

263
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,640
Sir, during the Jallikattu protests...

264
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,200
Get out.

265
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:18,200
You take so much risk in public,
set-up these men too...

266
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,760
why do you go through
all this pain?

267
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,560
Sir, we need to make money.

268
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,480
We want to make solid cash...
in lakhs and crores!

269
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,480
What will you do by making
lakhs and crores?

270
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,920
Sir, he is...

271
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,640
Don't.

272
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,000
No, dude.
It's the time to speak up.

273
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,760
Sir, his name is Viki.
He is my friend.

274
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,800
He fainted a couple
of days back.

275
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,480
After we rushed him to the hospital,
we found out...

276
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,360
He has brain tumour.

277
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,920
Sorry.

278
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,160
When we went to treat it,
we found out...

279
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,920
He has a hole in his heart.

280
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,960
A hole in your heart?

281
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,040
I'm sorry.

282
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,920
When we opened him up
to plug that hole, we found out...

283
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,680
his body is missing lungs.

284
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,600
What, then?

285
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,480
Why do we need reasons
to make money?

286
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,320
The reason is money itself!

287
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,880
It was nice and cool in there...

288
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,440
now, we're sweating.

289
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,440
Money!

290
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,240
The tomatoes we eat
is sold on the streets...

291
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,040
and our footwear
is sold in air-conditioned rooms.

292
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,640
Money, money, money.
Money is everything.

293
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,920
How do you survive in our country
without this basic general knowledge!

294
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,640
Do you have a visiting card?

295
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,400
Sir!

296
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,760
- This card is...
- Sir, one moment.

297
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,160
Got a pen?

298
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,280
Okay!

299
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,880
By the by,
this is my visiting card.

300
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,840
You can contact us anytime
to sponsor our videos.

301
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,960
But get in touch with us quickly
because we have a lot of sponsors waiting.

302
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,480
Sir, step aside please.

303
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,440
Dude, that guy who wanted to
sponsor 20 crores...

304
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,400
He backed out.

305
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,920
- He slippered us!
- He is gone too?

306
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,560
Oh, that's funny!

307
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,800
Who would dare come close
when I hold a knife to your neck?

308
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,440
The courage she gathered to slap me...
I need to break that courage.

309
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,520
Instilling that fear is true revenge.

310
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,200
Money, money, money.
Money is everything.

311
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,120
You said there's this guy Ram
who helps the beggars at the beach...

312
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,640
I don't see him here.

313
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,040
I wanted to interview him today.

314
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,240
The next time I see you in Chennai
with a camera, you're done for!

315
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,160
How come I've never seen you here before?

316
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,880
You want to sit up here?

317
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,360
- Careful.
- Watch it.

318
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,640
- Are you doing well?
- Yes.

319
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,560
- Have you two eaten?
- We have.

320
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,040
My name is Ram.
What's yours?

321
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,880
- My name is Kuppan...
- What about grandma?

322
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,320
My name is Azhagi!

323
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,840
These are my brothers,
Siva and Viki.

324
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,840
- Hi, darling.
- Yes, darling?

325
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,880
What a English!

326
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,080
How long have you been here?

327
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,560
We've been here for 30 years.

328
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,960
We beg here.

329
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,040
We live here.
We sleep here.

330
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,760
Where were you
before 30 years?

331
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,800
Thirty years back,
when grandma was cooking...

332
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,320
The stove exploded and she got
injuries on her hands and neck.

333
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,280
We went to the hospital.

334
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:05,440
Our children asked us to place our fingerprint
on a document to pay the hospital bills.

335
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,400
We were waiting and waiting
for them to return.

336
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,080
But they never came.

337
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,960
We left the hospital
and came here.

338
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,200
You came here?

339
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,920
How did you come here
with the burn injuries?

340
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,440
It was Kuppan who looked after me.
It took 3 years to heal.

341
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,840
You call your husband by name?

342
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,080
Why not?

343
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,040
I'll hit you!

344
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,360
I can't use my hands to eat.

345
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,120
Kuppan feeds me.

346
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,400
He fed you for 3 whole years?

347
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,560
No, Kuppan has been feeding me
for 30 years.

348
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:43,560
"Day after day, we run and run for ourselves;
This selfish life is a burden on the soul."

349
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:54,800
"Look for God in someone's smile;
For God lives in the heart of a loved one."

350
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,440
You've been feeding someone
for 30 years?

351
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,120
I'd even feed my beauty Azhagi
for another 40 years!

352
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,040
- What do you care?
- Look at him!

353
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,800
Getting all worked up.
Does grandpa lose his temper often?

354
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,960
Oh, yes.

355
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,600
When he gets angry,
he won't talk to me for 3 days.

356
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,600
Darling, do you really have to live with
such a short tempered man?

357
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,520
Why don't you come with me?
I will take such good care of you.

358
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,160
Yes, darling. I'm bored of
living with this man.

359
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,400
Why are you talking to that guy?

360
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,200
Darling, he feels possessive.

361
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,800
Let's irritate him?

362
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,840
Give me your hand.

363
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,160
Very good.

364
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,720
Come! Kiss me, darling.

365
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,240
Hey, don't kiss him!

366
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,560
- I will.
- Don't!

367
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,520
I will!

368
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,040
Grandpa, I'll build a hut for you
by the railway station.

369
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,480
You can live there and sell
vegetables from a cart.

370
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,480
- Okay?
- Okay...

371
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,160
- We need to pay rent, right?
- Come on, darling...

372
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,760
We will take care of that.

373
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,200
- Do you really mean it?
- Of course we do.

374
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:05,000
So my Azhagi is going
to sleep under a roof from now?

375
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:13,400
"The way of love is a higher state of mind;
Yes, it is a higher state of mind."

376
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,680
"There is no lock to contain love."

377
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,640
Sir?

378
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,600
Sir...

379
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,840
You're going a great deed.
I feel so happy.

380
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,640
Thanks.

381
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,760
Sir, my name is Nisha.

382
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,880
I work as a reporter at News7 Channel.

383
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,840
I actually came looking for you.
Can you give us an interview?

384
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,320
I'm not important enough
to give an interview.

385
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,880
I do these things
because it makes me happy.

386
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,120
If I give an interview,
the whole purpose changes.

387
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,080
Please don't mistake me.
Sorry.

388
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,840
Oh, okay sir.

389
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,120
But if you ever feel like
giving an interview...

390
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,000
call this number.

391
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,520
You dare ask him
for an interview?

392
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,560
- Brother, you know who she is?
- Who is she?

393
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,080
She is 'that' girl!

394
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,120
Yes, brother.

395
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,000
We've had a YouTube channel for years
and even we haven't asked him.

396
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,520
She thinks she'd get one
if she says 'Sir, interview sir?'

397
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,840
No interview.
Go away, woman!

398
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,360
Sir, it's okay if you
don't give us an interview...

399
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,200
but don't give it
to their channel!

400
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,000
Even 10 people won't watch.

401
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,080
What did you say, woman?

402
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,720
Hey, don't shout

403
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,640
Tell her

404
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,560
Don't mistake them.
That's just how they are.

405
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,520
Rip that card an throw it
at her face.

406
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,520
I'll rip it apart!

407
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,400
See, I'm taking that card...

408
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,200
I'm tearing it to pieces...

409
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,320
ripping it to shreds,
and throwing it away!

410
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,400
What?

411
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,000
Slip it inside.
I can see it!

412
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,440
Tuck it in properly.

413
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,840
Can't see it now.

414
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,320
Disgusting.

415
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,680
Dude...

416
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,800
- Look there.
- You traitor!

417
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,600
Look there!

418
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,000
You recognize him?

419
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:22,440
Isn't he the PA
of that tunic man from the mall?

420
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,120
Why is he all suited up
and drinking witch-grass juice?

421
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,040
He is following us.

422
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,680
What are you saying?

423
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,240
Yes, he was there
at the restaurant yesterday.

424
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,200
Dude...

425
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,640
something is happening
around us.

426
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,080
- We need to be careful.
- You are scaring me!

427
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,560
No need to be scared...

428
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,640
We will handle it.
Come

429
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,240
Actually Indian economy heavily depends
on agriculture and farming.

430
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,760
Yes, Mr. Viki...

431
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,320
But no one is taking
care of them.

432
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:00,880
Yeah...

433
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,720
During this crisis period,
youngsters should be taking care--

434
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,400
Was it the PA?

435
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,520
You, too?
What was your dream?

436
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,760
We were walking,
he rammed his car into us...

437
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,440
and shot us with a gun.

438
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,120
- What about you?
- Well...

439
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,800
[Singing a romantic song]

440
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,520
Viki!

441
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,760
Hi!

442
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,520
Viki...

443
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,640
Tell me,
what was your dream?

444
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,360
It was the same accident!
The same dream.

445
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,600
He rammed his car into us
and shot us with a gun.

446
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,120
Hi!

447
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,000
- Let's go.
- Take your hands off, perv!

448
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,680
Don't you have brothers?

449
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,360
Turn that AC on, please.

450
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,520
We need to make some serious money,
buy a house like this...

451
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,560
and rent it to our house owner.

452
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,560
You fool!

453
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,320
Why would you buy such a big house
and rent it out to our house owner?

454
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,360
It should be his wife!

455
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,880
Come on!

456
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,360
Oh, yes.

457
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,760
What is it?

458
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,360
What is it, dear?

459
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,800
What are you doing?

460
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,080
You sanction the liquor shops...
and then you protest against it too?

461
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,520
When did I protest against it?
You brainless moron!

462
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:43,200
If we build factories in all the farming lands,
what would you do for food?

463
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,040
I didn't build any factories.

464
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,000
I didn't build any either!

465
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,080
People don't even have water to drink,
but you want it to make cool drinks?

466
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,440
You stupid fool.
Why are you asking me all this?

467
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,840
Then whom do I ask?

468
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,280
There is a tunic clad man inside.
Go ask him!

469
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,760
Who was that guy?

470
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,920
Maybe that tunic man's
younger brother?

471
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,440
Could be!
They do look alike.

472
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,000
Why did you concede Katchatheevu?

473
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,200
Who are you, man?
Where did you come from?

474
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,680
You fool--

475
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,120
Why did you concede it?
Why, why, why?

476
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,920
- Please forgive him, please.
- Why didn't you come sooner?

477
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,480
Please don't take it the wrong way.
The boss is inside.

478
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,640
Come on.

479
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,080
Take that stick away from him.

480
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,440
Dude...

481
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,240
Hello, sir.

482
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,000
Sit.

483
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,200
That's okay, sir.
We can't sit in front of you.

484
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,120
Enough with the act.
Just sit.

485
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,680
He figured.

486
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,520
Sir, do you know how to play
the piano?

487
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,600
What would you do
if I said I didn't know?

488
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:42,000
All the rich people have it in their homes.
But I've never seen anyone playing it!

489
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,880
Do you know
why I asked you to come?

490
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,280
Of course!

491
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,320
Your daughter went missing
a couple of months back...

492
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,880
You couldn't find her anywhere.

493
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,960
It will damage your reputation if you
went to the police...

494
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,280
so you've called us.

495
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,640
- What are you blabbering?
- Then what?

496
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,720
How could we possibly know
why you called us?

497
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,080
You need to tell us!

498
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,360
This respectable man has all his
workers standing while he is seated...

499
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,960
is this the way you talk to him?

500
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Sorry, sir.

501
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,640
You tell us...

502
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,160
That big mouth!

503
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,160
Make it smaller.

504
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,720
Fine...

505
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,560
I'll tell you
why I called you.

506
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,320
Money, money, money.
You were crazy about it.

507
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,120
What sort of money
would make you happy?

508
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,040
Write it down.

509
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,400
Sir, you don't know us!

510
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,200
We would write an exorbitant amount!
Take it back.

511
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,360
Then write an exorbitant amount.

512
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,920
He's talking too much...

513
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,720
ask him for 10 grand!

514
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,520
Keep your mouth shut!

515
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,760
Ones, ten, hundred...

516
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,080
lakh, lakh and lakh...

517
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,640
We don't know if he has
that much money!

518
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,760
million, billion, and trillion!

519
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,040
That's our amount, sir.

520
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,480
I'll give you that amount
with a couple of extra zeros.

521
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,400
Will you do as I say?

522
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,480
Sir?

523
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,920
By 'giving', you mean,
you're actually giving it?

524
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,520
Sir, pardon sir...

525
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,600
Will you actually
give us the money?

526
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,800
Yes.

527
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,160
Wow, sir! Tell us...
what do we have to do?

528
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,920
- Well... - Sir, just say the word...
we will do it for you!

529
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
- You guys--
- We really want to do something for you!

530
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,160
Why are you still silent?
Just tell us what we need to do!

531
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,680
Let me speak.

532
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,480
Point, sir.

533
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,920
Tell us, sir.

534
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,760
I'll give you three tasks.

535
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,840
If you complete
all three tasks successfully...

536
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,560
I'll give you the money
you asked for.

537
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,360
But I have some conditions.

538
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:00,840
Condition 1 - The task could be anything.
You can't ask me any questions.

539
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:05,160
Condition 2 - Only after you
finish the first task will...

540
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,440
...I even tell you what the next task is.

541
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,480
Condition 3 - this is the
most important one.

542
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:15,400
If you complete the first two tasks
and give up at the final task...

543
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,920
you won't even get a single rupee.

544
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,560
The third task is very difficult.

545
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:26,080
Till you complete these tasks,
you need to stay where I tell you to.

546
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,440
You use the numbers I give you.

547
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,320
I'll take care of all the expenses
to complete these tasks.

548
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,200
If you agree to all these conditions...

549
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,880
sign on this agreement.

550
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,240
What are you thinking?

551
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,120
Are you scared?

552
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,920
No, sir...

553
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,040
The amount is okay.

554
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,160
It's just the tasks... 10 to 15
would have suited our level...

555
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,120
just three?

556
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,120
Only three!

557
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,040
Don't get cocky.

558
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,880
- The agreement...
- Here you go!

559
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,640
You're still playful...

560
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,760
The tasks will be extreme.

561
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,760
We're extreme people.
Tell us the task!

562
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,800
There are 22 news channels
in Tamil Nadu.

563
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:38,000
All 22 channels should carry
the same breaking news at the same time.

564
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,560
You should be in that breaking news.
I need to see your faces there.

565
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,400
You must get all the channels
to talk about you.

566
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:49,320
All the opinions and debates that day...
every single thing should be about you.

567
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,520
From the evening newspapers
to the next day papers,

568
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,480
all the headlines
should be about you.

569
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,840
All the FM radio channels
should talk about you.

570
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,200
In this huge screen here,
when I watch all 22 channels...

571
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,600
every one of them
should show your faces!

572
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,040
I need to watch it from here
and enjoy it.

573
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,920
I want to watch and enjoy it.

574
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,880
I want to watch and enjoy it.

575
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,520
I want to watch and enjoy it.

576
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,520
I want to watch and enjoy it.

577
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,400
You are an anti-Indian.

578
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,880
His name is not Vignesh.
It is actually Joseph Vignesh.

579
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,200
I've got a Xerox copy
of his identity card.

580
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,240
High Court?

581
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,640
High Court can go to--

582
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,840
Today, we are going to review the movie
'With your heart, for the truth, rise and charge'.

583
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,080
You may use the first couple of words
of an old song as a movie title.

584
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,240
You don't use an entire song
as the title!

585
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,320
Funny, funny, funny!

586
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,520
Dude...

587
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,200
It's a little difficult for us
to make breaking news.

588
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,240
A little difficult is something,
impossible is something else.

589
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,920
Come on, man.

590
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,240
You've been trying to call
Sun Music for six years!

591
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,600
Did you even get
your call through?

592
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,720
No.

593
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,880
That's the clout
we have in media.

594
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,040
Understand?

595
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,200
We can't even ask anyone for help.
We have problems with everyone in town!

596
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,920
Minister Nellore Gaja...

597
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:50,280
is meeting ISRO scientists today
in Sriharikota.

598
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,960
We expect a breakthrough in science
following this meeting.

599
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,120
Come what may,
we are not going to her!

600
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,680
Right, right, right.

601
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,800
Even if we die penniless,
we are not asking her for help.

602
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,040
Correct, correct, correct.

603
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,400
I'm too cool.

604
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,560
Not her, of all people.

605
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,160
Are you idiots?

606
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,560
Wants to feature on breaking news!

607
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,720
Do you always come up
with twisted ideas like these?

608
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,600
Nisha, Nisha, Nisha, Nisha!
Please, Nisha!

609
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,080
Help us somehow.

610
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Please!

611
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,280
Please?

612
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,000
First tell me why you want
to be in breaking news?

613
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,080
Don't ask us that!

614
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,960
If you give us a good idea, we will
find a way to make it to breaking news.

615
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,040
You don't get it?

616
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,800
Do you know what breaking news means?

617
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,400
News is generally scheduled ahead of time.

618
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,320
But we put all that aside,
and break some important news.

619
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,920
How will you ever fit in there?

620
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,480
If you dare touch my phone,
I'll cuss at you real bad.

621
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,400
Why are you touching my phone
without my permission?

622
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,120
Fat cupcake!

623
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,120
You can't keep your hands to yourself?

624
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,400
This is an important business meeting.
Stop fidgeting.

625
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,800
Fat cupcake!

626
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,760
Forget him, Nisha.
Please do something.

627
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,360
Anything!

628
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,440
We will do exactly as you say.

629
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,640
Help us in some way.
Please, Nisha.

630
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,120
Fine...

631
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,920
You have a camera, right?

632
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,040
Take it and roam around the city.

633
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,160
Try to get some good footage
that can be breaking news.

634
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,560
Everyday at 6,
my friend reports 100 different news.

635
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,040
I can ask her to include yours
as one among them.

636
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,840
I'm doing this not for you,
but for your brother.

637
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,800
Nisha, the boss called for you.

638
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,720
Damn.

639
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,320
Fat cupcake!

640
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,200
Forget it.

641
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,600
She says she will cover us
if we get her something.

642
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,840
She has a porn movie in her mobile

643
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,000
Wait, what?!

644
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:02,000
I'm sure she does! That's why
she isn't allowing me to touch it.

645
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,240
Really?

646
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,960
Yes, dude.

647
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,400
The stuff they watch
is something else.

648
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,000
Not like us.

649
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,800
She has a pattern lock.

650
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,320
Oh no! She has a pattern lock?

651
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:24,240
Her name is Nisha.
The pattern should be N!

652
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,280
Give it.

653
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,240
A disgrace to pattern locks!

654
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,440
See, it's open!

655
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,760
Oh! So these girls fall in love
with men who get kisses from grannies.

656
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,720
Come on!

657
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,000
Just one kiss.

658
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,880
You still haven't left?

659
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,080
The very sight of your faces annoy me.

660
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,760
Such weirdos.

661
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,160
It's you I'm scolding.
Why are you grinning?

662
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,560
Did you take my phone?

663
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,000
I've got a pattern lock!

664
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,360
Yeah, like it's a
really secure pattern!

665
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,000
Look how secure it is.

666
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,200
Sir, come here.

667
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,200
Her name is Nisha,
and this is her phone.

668
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,240
She has a pattern.
Open it.

669
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,560
If her name is Nisha,
it should be N, right?

670
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,040
There you go!

671
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:56,560
"My fingers yearn to touch you,
Come, give me a kiss!"

672
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:02,200
"My fingers long to feel you,
Come, let's start the war."

673
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,240
- Are you going to sing a duet?
- Why do you ask?

674
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,080
We have lots of work.
Holy shit!

675
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,040
Coming back to work, Mr. Siva...

676
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,920
did you get any idea
for breaking news?

677
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,480
Let me tell one idea.

678
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,480
Yes, please!

679
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,520
A man sticks his head into the mouth
of a crocodile that entered the city - Vignesh!

680
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,560
Traitor!

681
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:25,280
The man who decided to jump
head first from the LIC building... Siva!

682
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,720
A man dances naked
in Mount Road... Vignesh!

683
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,680
A lone man cleans up
Marina Beach... Siva!

684
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,600
Take it!

685
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,840
That sounds like a good idea.

686
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,880
What are you saying?

687
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,080
You're going to clean
the beach single-handedly?

688
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,200
Then why are we still thinking?

689
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,960
Hello, put that down!

690
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,240
Go away.

691
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,920
Dude, look here...

692
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,480
I did this only yesterday morning!

693
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,280
Fat pancake!

694
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,760
Nothing we shot so far has worked.

695
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,600
Didn't I tell you,
this is not for us.

696
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,680
Coming on breaking news
isn't a simple thing.

697
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,680
We're acting like lunatics.

698
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,480
I know we are acting like lunatics.

699
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,720
you think I don't get that?

700
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,760
But think about it.

701
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,520
No one else here would have
got a chance like we have.

702
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,440
Even we won't get another chance
like this in our lives again.

703
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,000
So I want to make use of it.

704
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,680
Just think about it,
what do we have to lose?

705
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,000
Let's try to give it our best shot.

706
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,360
You're blabbering.

707
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,200
Brother, please don't...

708
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,400
Just drink it, girl.

709
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,440
- I want to go home.
- Here, drink it.

710
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,560
Open your mouth!
Drink up...

711
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,600
Pour it in her mouth.

712
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,680
Dude, pour it

713
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,560
Something wrong is happening.

714
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,760
What do we do now?

715
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,120
Come here.

716
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,600
Roll the camera.

717
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,400
Frame it with them on one half
and me on the other.

718
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,960
- Okay?
- Action!

719
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:49,720
Four rich boys here are harassing
two public school girls.

720
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,320
Such injustices continue happening
all over Tamil Nadu.

721
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:55,000
To prevent such incidents,
we must stop them in the act.

722
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,640
Viki will now show you
how to stop such incidents.

723
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,880
Viki, my foot!

724
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,600
Why don't you go and save them?

725
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,120
All of them are big and bulky.

726
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,080
You'd be a good match.

727
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,560
For your kind information Mr. Siva,
I am the cameraman.

728
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,280
I work the camera,
you save the girls.

729
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,040
If everyone minds their own job,
someone has to go save them!

730
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,680
You could be that someone!

731
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,960
Go ahead.

732
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:24,320
- Try to be socially conscious...
- If you are just going to talk...

733
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,720
someone will--

734
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,440
They're gone!

735
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,720
What?

736
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,000
Why won't he blink?

737
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,520
You're committing all the mistakes.

738
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,240
I've been watching you.
Such an irresponsible Indian citizen.

739
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,680
- Who, me?
- Yes, you!

740
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,320
Wretched man.

741
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,880
We've missed the
only proper content we got.

742
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:46,880
Happy?

743
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,960
Good content...

744
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,240
Did you think about this?

745
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,000
We tried to do good things.
But not one person was interested.

746
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,240
But when something bad happens,
we give it all our attention.

747
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,600
So?

748
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:04,600
We shouldn't do good things anymore.

749
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:05,840
Only bad things.

750
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,560
What do you mean?

751
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,320
We shall become suicide bombers

752
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,160
We didn't know any other way.

753
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,600
All the press and media from Tamil Nadu
need to be here in the next 5 minutes.

754
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:23,640
Or I'll press the remote I'm holding,
and explode these bombs.

755
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,400
Three...

756
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,720
Two...

757
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,280
- One...
- Bro!

758
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:31,400
Bro, aren't you from that
YouTube channel?

759
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,040
Bro, the prank you played
at the park was so funny.

760
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,360
What are you doing here?

761
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,640
What's this TV remote?

762
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,280
- Who is this guy?
- No idea!

763
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,880
Oh, so you were doing a prank here?

764
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,320
Bro, judging by everyone's scared faces,
I'm sure this prank will be a big hit.

765
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,280
Superb, bro. Bye!
All the best!

766
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,680
We'll throw ourselves
in front of the CM's convoy.

767
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:57,040
All hail Tamil Nadu's permanent
Chief Minister!

768
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,440
The leader of our future!

769
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,400
Dude...

770
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,920
If you've got any dirt on
your moustache, clean it!

771
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,200
When we rise,
the press is going to be all over us.

772
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:20,600
Did all these people come here
to feature in some breaking news?

773
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:37,880
'Two youth desperate to feature
in breaking news face untimely death.'

774
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:45,560
I'm telling you...finally that's going to be
the breaking news.

775
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,800
Why don't you answer the damn phone?

776
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,680
Why are you rejecting her calls?

777
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:56,720
Let it go.

778
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,840
That girl loves you.
You know that, right?

779
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,160
I know...

780
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,600
that's why she is going
out of her way to help us.

781
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,680
You love that girl, too.
You know that, right?

782
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,320
What's that look?

783
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:13,280
Don't pretend!
I've been noticing you.

784
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:15,680
Yes...

785
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,680
I like her too.

786
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,800
- But...
- But what?

787
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,640
If you are into this crap,
just say it out loud.

788
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:28,800
I like her, yes!

789
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,600
Are we in any place
to ask a girl out?

790
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,240
Let's complete these 3 tasks first...

791
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,560
then I'll tell her in person.

792
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,640
There is a big difference between
telling her now and telling her later.

793
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,800
Complete 3 tasks, then love, and marriage.

794
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,320
Must tell that girl
to find some other man!

795
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,840
He's dead meat.

796
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,400
Actually I'm answering your calls.
But see, it's getting rejected!

797
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,680
- What are you doing here?
- We are...

798
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,720
- Breaking news...
- Are you mad?

799
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,280
Do you know what you're doing?

800
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,560
Who are you?
Who the hell are you?

801
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,880
Are you a politician?
Or a celebrity?

802
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:16,920
Who are you?

803
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,000
Are you Kamal Haasan or Kareena Kapoor
to make it to news when you have a fever?

804
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,800
Understand one thing.

805
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,800
These days, breaking news don't happen.

806
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:25,880
It's being created.

807
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,520
Come with me.

808
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,520
The MP is on a hunger
protest with his son-

809
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,600
-to close down the liquor
shop next to the school.

810
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,960
The liquor shop has been there for 4 years.

811
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,400
He didn't mind it these 4 years,
why is he suddenly concerned now?

812
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:48,240
Now all the media have come here
with our mics to cover this.

813
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,080
Sir!

814
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:55,360
My daughter wouldn't have done
such a thing.

815
00:48:55,400 --> 00:49:00,000
Two school girls got drunk and jumped into
the pond, committing suicide.

816
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,960
I think they had relationship problems.

817
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:03,720
Their parents are weeping.

818
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,600
Saying, 'Our girls don't drink..
they were really good girls.'

819
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:10,080
'Please don't put this in the papers
and tarnish their names.'

820
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:14,040
But then parents really don't know
if their kids drink.

821
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:18,720
The liquor shop CCTV has recorded
the two girls buying booze there.

822
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,080
That's the case here.
But over there...

823
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:26,920
the MP's men won't allow the bodies to be
removed till the liquor shop is sealed shut

824
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,160
This is the news for the next 3 days.

825
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,760
We will run behind these people.

826
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:35,400
For the media to come after you,
you need to be a politician or a rich person.

827
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:38,040
You can't do it.
Let's get that straight.

828
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,200
My daughter doesn't drink.
She doesn't.

829
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:47,200
Please give my girl back to me.
My little one!

830
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,240
My little girl.

831
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,680
Sir, you can't go in.

832
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,800
Sir, please.
It's important.

833
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:37,080
Two young girls have died due to
liquor consumption today.

834
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,160
I need to go in!

835
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,960
Get out of here.

836
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,560
Who is the reason for this?

837
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:45,440
Is it the girls?
Or their parents?

838
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,160
- We can't raise our voice against them.
- Listen...

839
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,120
Not at all.

840
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,160
We are the reason.

841
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,440
Every youth in this country is responsible.

842
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:05,640
Sir, so your son is also responsible?

843
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,000
Brother...

844
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,800
What did you say?

845
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:17,000
You said every youth was responsible.
I asked if your son is included, too.

846
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:20,320
A young man has been waiting a long time
to talk about this.

847
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:23,440
Let us know how deeply
you care for his opinion?

848
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,960
Ask him to come.
Let's talk.

849
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Superb, sir!

850
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:32,800
Siva.

851
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,880
The MP says that every youth
is responsible for this misfortune.

852
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:03,080
Do you wish to comment on that?

853
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,560
I'm going to tell you something
more important.

854
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:09,200
Do you know how
those two girls actually died?

855
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,640
Stick to the stuff
you wanted to speak about.

856
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,560
Don't digress from the topic.
Okay?

857
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:16,080
One moment, sir.
Let me say what I have to say.

858
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,600
Tell me...

859
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,760
Do you think those two girls
committed suicide?

860
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,520
How did they die, then?

861
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,280
Someone could have threatened them
to go to the liquor shop.

862
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:28,360
And the girls could have bought liquor
out of fear.

863
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,800
Then they could have been forced
to drink that liquor and then killed.

864
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:35,040
The boy's father, fearing
for his son's future,

865
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:38,000
could divert everyone by
organising this protest.

866
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:39,920
It could be anything.

867
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,280
What do you mean?

868
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:49,080
Based on what you're saying...
the MP is the one on a hunger protest.

869
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:51,320
Are you accusing his son
of killing the girls?

870
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,960
What's all this nonsense?

871
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,200
Just because you have a mic
you'd say anything you want?

872
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,600
Do you know it's a crime to accuse someone
without any evidence?

873
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,600
Do you have any evidence?

874
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:04,600
Do you have any evidence at all?
Show us the proof!

875
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,080
Tell us, sir...
do you have any evidence?

876
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:09,920
Our media friends are asking you!
Answer them.

877
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,880
- Any evidence?
- Tell them!

878
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,800
- Do you have the evidence?
- I have evidence.

879
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,840
Then quit talking
and show us the evidence.

880
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,040
- Show us, sir.
- Show it!

881
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,040
Don't just talk. Show us the evidence.

882
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,760
Buddy, someone is killing it here.

883
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,960
He is showing a video of the MP's son
harassing those girls as evidence.

884
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,120
- Really?
- I'll send a live feed...

885
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,440
you tell the people there
and break the news.

886
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,320
Right away!

887
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,360
We have some great news.
Inform our boss.

888
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:18,120
'There is a witness against to
Central Minister's son'

889
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:39,600
Had I been there,
I'd have chopped them down like vegetables.

890
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:42,280
I'd shave off their ears
along with the beard.

891
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,280
'Will police arrest minister's son?'

892
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,960
'Will police arrest minister's son?'

893
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,480
Slow.

894
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:59,680
What's the point in being on
all the major breaking news?

895
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:02,040
We're still scared of that mad-man.

896
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:07,320
I have a feeling that mad-man
is out here somewhere...

897
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:09,120
watching us.

898
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:10,880
Shut your mouth.

899
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:15,200
Why did you kill Gandhi?

900
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,720
Gandhi is dead?

901
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,000
Oh, no.

902
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,400
The monkey got away.

903
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,040
What's an African doing in Tamil Nadu?

904
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,200
I'm from Africa?
You saw that?

905
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,400
Don't speak.
Don't speak.

906
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,240
Sir!

907
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:30,640
Hello, sir.

908
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,320
You're both on every breaking news.

909
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:37,080
In all 22 channels.
Very good!

910
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,960
How? How did you do it?
I really don't understand...

911
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,400
How did you manage it?
Tell me.

912
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,360
Oh, it's nothing.
Ever since childhood--

913
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,560
You said no one other than you
knew this number?

914
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:49,920
I am getting so many threats by call.
It's scary.

915
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,200
I'm here for you, dear.

916
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,560
I'll handle it.

917
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,040
Thanks, sir.

918
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,520
Sir, about the second task...

919
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,320
What was that sound?

920
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,720
I bit him!

921
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,200
What?

922
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:08,240
Yeah, man.

923
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,360
Look, sir. Either he stays in this house
or I stay.

924
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,600
The choice is yours.

925
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,520
But you don't even live in this house.

926
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:14,920
Only he lives here.

927
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,440
What does it matter who lives where?

928
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,600
Ask him what the task is,
let's get it over with.

929
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:20,800
Mani...

930
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,960
His name is Mani.

931
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,480
- He is a little...
- I know!

932
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,280
I know, sir.
I know.

933
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,680
- If you hand him a stick--
- I know!

934
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,280
I know, sir.
I know.

935
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,920
Make him an MLA
in the upcoming by-elections.

936
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:51,200
Mr. Siva, take good care of your health.
Eat your meals on time.

937
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:54,440
Don't go sleepless because of the task.
Be wise with your money.

938
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,440
- Come on, man.
- What, then?

939
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:57,240
If it were possible,
we could become MLAs instead of him.

940
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,120
He is mad.

941
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,160
And this man is mad
for setting us this task.

942
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,680
What are you looking at?

943
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,280
You have all this money.
Why don't 'you' make him an MLA?

944
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:07,160
Like we don't have enough geniuses
for politicians in our country.

945
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,480
This won't work.

946
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,360
Be quiet.
We will talk it out.

947
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:11,440
Sir...

948
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,600
Please don't joke around.

949
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:16,480
Really...?
Is this the task?

950
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,280
This is the second task.

951
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:21,360
You must make him an MLA
in the by-elections.

952
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,840
I will take care of all the expenses.

953
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,960
He never fails to say this line,
no matter what.

954
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:34,560
- Buddy...
- Get lost, man.

955
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,360
Listen up, man.

956
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,280
We can handle this.

957
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,640
Don't tell me we're
going to do this task.

958
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,720
What we did earlier was tough.
This is very easy.

959
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:47,480
What? Making this mad man
a politician is easy?

960
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:48,880
Oh...

961
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:52,680
He did agree to foot all the expenses.

962
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,880
Politicians are just criminals.

963
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:57,480
Now we need to find the
most criminal of the criminals.

964
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:03,560
We need to find someone whose mind,
body and soul is seeped in corruption.

965
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:09,120
If we give him the money,
he will make him an MLA.

966
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:14,120
You mean a political criminal?

967
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,120
Yes.

968
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:41,280
Keep it shut.

969
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,280
Sit down.

970
00:59:58,280 --> 00:59:59,600
So it's you?

971
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:03,600
You said you are willing to
spend as much as needed to make an MLA?

972
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,280
Yes, sir.
That's me.

973
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:07,800
What do you mean,
Spend as much as needed?

974
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:09,640
We can spend as much as needed, sir.

975
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,640
Who wants to become an MLA?
You?

976
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,160
No, sir.

977
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:15,840
Him.

978
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,920
You have a lot of money?

979
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:20,720
If yes, tell me.
I'll make both of you MLAs.

980
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:23,600
Dear, there can only be one MLA
in one constituency.

981
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:24,880
What's wrong with that?

982
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,360
Aren't there states
with two chief ministers?

983
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:30,920
Let two people rather than one person
do good for the constituency.

984
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:32,960
Okay, son.

985
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:35,640
You can discuss money matters
with my Baby here.

986
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,160
We'll meet at the party office tomorrow.

987
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,320
Wait, dear.

988
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:40,400
You forgot our little brother.

989
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:43,160
Oh, thank god.
I forgot to mention.

990
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,800
I will introduce you to someone
very important.

991
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,080
This is my sister's son.
His name is Little Face.

992
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:54,640
Since his childhood, he has to sneeze
before I leave home.

993
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,400
If he sneezes, I will have
a good day.

994
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:00,600
But he needs to feel like sneezing
at that moment, right?

995
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,400
Oh, we will make him feel it.

996
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:04,400
- Do it.
- Okay, leader.

997
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:19,720
That's done.
This endeavour will be successful.

998
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,240
You have won!

999
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,960
He looks so weird.

1000
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,640
What if the people are unhappy
when we let him contest?

1001
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,640
People?
Who are these people?

1002
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:30,560
You mean those who speak
indignantly all year...

1003
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:34,840
and at election time take thousand or two
thousand rupees for votes?

1004
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,800
You mean those who
participate in protests...

1005
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:41,520
but when a 20-20 cricket match is on,
shamelessly go to watch the game?

1006
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:44,960
When our farmers were protesting
semi-naked for 100 days in New Delhi...

1007
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,720
those who sat in their homes and voted for
reality TV contestants Aarav and Oviya?

1008
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,120
Who are the people? Huh?
Who are they?

1009
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:52,680
Have we not cheated them in the past?

1010
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:54,520
Have they not been cheated
by us in the past?

1011
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:56,200
Worst case, what can they do?

1012
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,040
They'll spit on us?
If they spit

1013
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,520
We shall wipe it.

1014
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,280
This girl?

1015
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,200
Why is she jumping over
this compound wall?

1016
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:27,640
Who knows who this little mouse
is playing hide-n-seek with?

1017
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,200
Girl, I'll get you.

1018
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:49,440
When we said we're featuring in
breaking news, you called us crazy.

1019
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,800
And now you're secretly
making plans with him?

1020
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:53,560
Tell me, how much
is he paying you?

1021
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:55,280
I thought you were something else.

1022
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:57,240
But you're doing such a thing
just for money?

1023
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:59,520
Tell me, what were you doing in Bombay?

1024
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:00,400
Shut up.

1025
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,120
Don't keep yelling like a fool.

1026
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,560
I am his daughter.

1027
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,560
His daughter?

1028
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:07,960
You mean you're his daughter?

1029
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:09,240
Yes, moron.

1030
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:12,120
He is my father.
The outside world doesn't know.

1031
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,600
I work as a reporter
and observe the happenings...

1032
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:17,320
get Intel on news channels
and their stance, find allies...

1033
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,400
and I pass on this information.

1034
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:22,240
With this knowledge,
he works in politics and wins.

1035
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:23,720
What is your problem?

1036
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,160
You wretch!

1037
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,200
Disgusting.

01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:44,360
- Will you?
- I will.

1209
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:47,880
- Will you extract methane?
- I won't. I swear I won't!

1210
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:52,680
'Candidate Mani manhandles the reporter'

1211
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,520
Is he even a leader? [Spits]

1212
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:58,520
It's about what the people need--

1213
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:01,160
He is a mad man!

1214
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:03,480
That rascal!

1215
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:06,320
Had I trusted him with a daughter,
he would have beat her to death.

1216
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:08,720
If you have read Osho's books,
you would know

1217
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:10,240
All the answers are in the books.

1218
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,480
He is a mad man!

1219
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:13,520
Sir!

1220
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:17,600
But he is a mad man!

1221
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:19,360
Who are you calling a mad man?

1222
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:32,280
U.K. Nagar by-elections have ended
in a peaceful manner.

1223
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:35,480
75% of the people have voted.

1224
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:40,800
The much awaited counting of votes
is to begin tomorrow morning at 10.

1225
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:49,880
Oh, no!

1226
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:52,800
Dude, wake up.

1227
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:54,400
- Wake up!
- Yes, Nisha.

1228
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:56,200
Yes, I love you too.

1229
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:59,360
Siva is not such a nice guy
like you think.

1230
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:04,120
You can hit me,
but I won't change my mind, Nisha.

1231
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:06,400
The count is taking place.

1232
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:12,200
The ruling party's candidate Mani is behind
the opposition party's Thangadurai...

1233
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:15,320
by 2200 votes at the
end of the first round.

1234
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:17,680
It's over.
We're doomed.

1235
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:19,280
We've lost.

1236
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:24,520
NASA party has never lost
at U.K Nagar till now.

1237
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:30,000
I told you this won't work out.

1238
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:32,280
You won't get a single rupee.

1239
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,160
Complete 3 tasks, then love, and marriage.

1240
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,600
Must tell that girl
to find some other man!

1241
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:39,840
Everyone come here

1242
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:41,240
Boss has come

1243
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:45,640
Sir, the counting is about to be done.
What do we do?

1244
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:47,680
Sir?

1245
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:51,240
Can we call somebody,
do something?

1246
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:53,600
Sir?

1247
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:55,520
Sir...

1248
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:58,840
We trusted you and spent so much money.
But now they're leading.

1249
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:01,960
Sir?

1250
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:04,360
Sir...

1251
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,160
Tell me your three favourite numbers.

1252
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:08,320
Three what?

1253
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,640
Come on, tell me your
three favourite numbers.

1254
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:13,280
7, 3 and 4.
Why do you ask?

1255
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:14,240
Sir?

1256
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:15,920
Go downstairs
and see for yourself.

1257
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:17,920
- Sir?
- Go downstairs and see.

1258
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:24,000
U.K. Nagar by-election vote counting
has come to an end.

1259
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,920
With a margin of 734 votes,

1260
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:31,560
ruling party's Mani has won over the
opposition candidate Thangadurai.

1261
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,080
Money, money, money.

1262
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:44,160
I've told you about people.

1263
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:46,440
Now let me tell you about money.

1264
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:49,600
The man who picked pockets
to fill his belly is locked up in prison.

1265
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:52,960
The man who trampled over starving bellies
and made money, is in power.

1266
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:53,920
Money.

1267
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:57,080
The man who brews illegal liquor
is given honorary doctorate.

1268
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:59,000
The man who aspired to
be a doctor...

1269
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:01,600
all his life ends his life unable
to attend coaching.

1270
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:02,440
Money.

1271
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:05,320
If you have money, you can get drunk
and run over homeless people on sidewalks.

1272
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:08,480
If you have money, you can destroy forests
and erect statues for yourself.

1273
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:10,760
If you have money,
you can do anything.

1274
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:11,520
Money.

1275
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:13,840
Everyone bribed the voters with money.

1276
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:15,480
I think different.

1277
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:17,400
I bribed the vote counter with money.

1278
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:18,760
Everybody knows.

1279
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,440
I got this far in politics
only with money.

1280
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:22,520
What can they do?

1281
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,480
Worst case, they will spit on me.

1282
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:26,600
- If they spit--
- We shall wipe it off, sir!

1283
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:35,240
You're God!

1284
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:40,000
Dude, we won!

1285
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:41,440
We won!

1286
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:43,640
'Our beloved brother Mani'

1287
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:04,760
Finally, you've turned him
into a politician too!

1288
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:08,360
Siva, Viki! How are you?

1289
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:10,240
Let's take a picture.

1290
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:14,160
You should stay for the meal.

1291
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:17,880
What's all this?

1292
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:24,600
Oh, so you're the reason?

1293
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:27,440
Oh, no.
Him and his stupid face.

1294
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:29,440
Move it.

1295
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:34,640
Long live... MLA Mani.

1296
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:38,000
Dude, we completed both the tasks!

1297
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:40,280
Oh, yeah.

1298
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:45,720
If we finish the third task as well
and collect all the money...

1299
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:52,560
Meets the VJ here

1300
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:01,640
Sir, there's a problem.

1301
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:02,480
What is it?

1302
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:06,160
A man is troubling me
asking for a recharge of 30 lakhs.

1303
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:10,800
Dammit!

1304
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:13,560
What's the problem?
Why hasn't the train left?

1305
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:16,680
Two men are causing a ruckus
insisting on buying the train.

1306
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:19,360
What? Someone wants to buy off
the government train?

1307
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:25,440
Grandma, why are you running?

1308
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:29,040
Two men are harassing me asking me
to cook 'vadais' on the moon.

1309
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:30,560
They're coming!

1310
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:38,040
Hello, NASA.
No, we don't sell rockets.

1311
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:41,600
What? Sparkle firecrackers?
Flower pot?

1312
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:42,800
Bull shit.

1313
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:54,560
Siva and Viki have shocked the nation...

1314
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:57,840
by meeting Donald Trump
at the White House...

1315
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:01,200
and asking to buy off America.

1316
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,680
Sir, we have completed
both the tasks assigned by you.

1317
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:17,480
If you tell us about that
difficult third task...

1318
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:20,440
we'll quickly get it done, collect
our payment and be on our way.

1319
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:25,560
I understand.

1320
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:29,000
For our calibre, it's hard to come up
with a task difficult enough.

1321
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:31,120
But tell us whatever you had in mind.

1322
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:32,520
We'll handle it.

1323
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:38,640
This coming Wednesday morning at 7:30...

1324
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:42,240
there will be an attempt to kill a girl
at Kodambakkam Railway Station.

1325
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,240
You must prevent that murder.

1326
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,440
Sir, stop kidding.

1327
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:55,640
What's our task?

1328
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:57,080
Let me finish.

1329
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:00,960
You don't know the identity
of the murderer.

1330
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:03,000
You don't know the identity
of the victim either.

1331
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:06,280
Most importantly, you may not
carry any weapons.

1332
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:08,520
When he pulls out his knife to attack her,

1333
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:10,720
you can use anything you
find there to hit him.

1334
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:14,240
In front of everyone,
you must prevent the murder.

1335
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:17,760
Do we look like idiots to you?

1336
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:19,160
What?

1337
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:21,560
Dude, this man is fooling us.

1338
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,080
He wants us to prevent a murder.

1339
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:25,720
That too, without any weapons.

1340
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,720
You think you and I
can do this?

1341
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:30,400
When we get close,
the knife could be on our throats.

1342
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:31,680
What will you do?

1343
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:33,480
What if I die stopping it?

1344
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:34,440
What if you die?

1345
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,760
Or if we lose a limb?
What then?

1346
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:41,280
We have been fooled.
This man is cheating us.

1347
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:44,560
I told you in the very beginning,
the tasks could be anything.

1348
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:46,440
You did agree to it.

1349
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,720
You said it could be anything,
but not that we could die.

1350
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:51,560
I don't want this.

1351
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:53,560
Give us half the money.
We'll be on our way.

1352
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:55,800
You have these huge men
standing outside your doors.

1353
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:58,160
Use them for this task.
Let us go.

1354
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:01,680
If you don't complete this task,
you won't get a single paisa.

1355
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:06,360
For the past five months,
we've done nothing but slog on your tasks.

1356
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,880
Now you have the gall to tell us
you won't pay a single paisa?

1357
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:10,800
Okay, forget about the money.

1358
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:13,800
Won't you do this for me?

1359
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:15,240
For you?

1360
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:18,040
Who are you?
Why should I do this for you?

1361
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:21,440
You don't care if we die there.
Why should we do this for you?

1362
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:23,440
Fine, let that go.

1363
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:26,640
We've done so much.
Have you ever told us why?

1364
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:29,080
Why make it to breaking news?
Why get a mad man elected as MLA?

1365
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:31,560
Why prevent this murder?
How do you know it's about to take place?

1366
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:34,240
You won't tell us any of this
but we should die for you?

1367
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:35,720
I have no need for that.

1368
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:37,720
Either, you tell us why.

1369
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,920
Or you pay us half the agreed amount.

1370
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:42,720
If not, we know how to get our hands
on that money.

1371
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:44,240
We'll handle it.

1372
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:45,720
Let's go.

1373
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:50,960
Dad...

1374
01:22:58,360 --> 01:22:59,800
How are you?

1375
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:06,120
It's been so many days
since you spoke properly to me, you know?

1376
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:10,480
Ever since I became a reporter,
you've stopped talking to me.

1377
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:15,320
You keep telling me to work with you
on your business...

1378
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:17,840
but I don't like business, dad.

1379
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:21,600
I want to become a great journalist, dad.
Want to cover many news items.

1380
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:23,360
One day, I shall uncover
a major news...

1381
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:25,840
that will be the breaking
news in all channels.

1382
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:31,600
In our big screen TV at home,
I want to be on all 22 channels we surf.

1383
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:35,360
And you should sit back on the sofa
and watch it like a king.

1384
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:37,480
You should watch it like a king, dad.

1385
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:40,520
We won't get any of
this in business, dad.

1386
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:45,360
That's why I went against your word
and joined as a reporter, dad.

1387
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:47,640
I've always wanted to tell you
these things in person.

1388
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:51,040
But you've never had the time
to even lend me a ear.

1389
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:54,360
I wished to buy you a gift
with my first month's salary.

1390
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:59,240
That's why I've told you everything
in the form of this gift.

1391
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:03,440
Dad, on your birthday...

1392
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,560
I only ask for one thing.

1393
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:10,160
Will you hug me just one time?

1394
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:23,440
My son.

1395
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:26,040
His name was Anbu.

1396
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:30,720
He would always say, 'I want to
be a reporter, feature in breaking news.'

1397
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:34,920
I would always scold him saying,
What money could possibly be there in it?

1398
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,120
But he was adamant
and became a reporter.

1399
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:40,560
I was so angry,
I stopped talking to him.

1400
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:46,000
I thought, if I didn't talk to him,
he would work in the business.

1401
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:49,920
Business, business, business.
I knew nothing else.

1402
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:52,800
When he gave me this gift...

1403
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,840
that was the last time I saw him.

1404
01:24:57,080 --> 01:24:58,160
Dad...

1405
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:00,600
What? Tell me, I'm running late.

1406
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,560
Dad, it's your birthday.

1407
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:04,080
So I got you this gift.

1408
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:05,200
What gift?

1409
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:06,920
A cell phone?

1410
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:07,560
Dad...

1411
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:09,920
What does it cost?
6,000? Or 8,000?

1412
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:12,200
Do you know how much my cell phone costs?

1413
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:13,600
Do you know who uses this?

1414
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:15,120
- Ramasamy!
- Boss?

1415
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:20,440
Keep doing such jobs and these are
the kind of gifts you can buy me.

1416
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:22,680
You better come and join my business.

1417
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:28,000
Then I left to my office.

1418
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:30,960
I got a call from my son
a little while later.

1419
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:35,440
Dad, I'm going to feature
in a breaking news.

1420
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:37,280
What?
You're featuring in a breaking news?

1421
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:40,080
Stop blabbering.
I'm in a meeting, don't disturb me.

1422
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:42,600
- Dad, dad, dad...
- Calm down and talk!

1423
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:43,960
Listen to me, dad!

1424
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,120
Someone has murdered a man
under the bridge!

1425
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:52,440
Murdered?

1426
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:54,200
- Where are you?
- Listen to me!

1427
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:58,200
I went closer to see his face,
but he had covered it with a kerchief.

1428
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:00,600
So I've come to his house
following him.

1429
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:02,160
You went to his house?

1430
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,160
You shouldn't be there.

1431
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:06,640
Get out of there right away.

1432
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:08,560
We'll inform the police.
Get out of there.

1433
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:10,920
No, dad. I overheard
everything they were talking.

1434
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:14,200
There is a verdict in the court
on December 26th.

1435
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:15,280
The very next day,

1436
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:19,200
they are going to murder a girl
in Kodambakkam Railway Station.

1437
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:21,040
Murder?
They're going to murder?

1438
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:23,640
Son, you shouldn't be there.

1439
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:25,320
They will kill you.

1440
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:27,320
Tell me where you are.
Tell me.

1441
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:30,280
Didn't I always say I wanted
to be on the breaking news?

1442
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:31,680
This is the perfect chance.

1443
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:34,320
I'll get to the railway
station with reporters...

1444
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:37,800
and cameramen when
they come to murder.

1445
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:41,200
Just when they are about to murder,
I will intervene and prevent it.

1446
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:43,440
I will get captured on every camera,
won't I?

1447
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:45,640
I will definitely be on breaking news,
won't I?

1448
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:47,640
Fool of a son!
Don't talk like an idiot.

1449
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:49,360
None of what you say will happen.

1450
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:51,640
Not a single soul will come
when you call them.

1451
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:53,720
- Get out of there.
- No, I can't.

1452
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:56,680
This will work.
I will be on the breaking news.

1453
01:26:56,720 --> 01:26:58,400
I will never get another chance.

1454
01:26:58,480 --> 01:26:59,840
Fool! You fool!

1455
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:02,240
Tell me where you are.
Daddy will come and--

1456
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:09,320
This number can't be reached

1457
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:11,120
I looked everywhere.

1458
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:13,520
I got a call three hours later.

1459
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:16,560
That my son is lying dead
in the railway station.

1460
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,240
I went and looked.

1461
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:21,440
They had slashed him
in twelve places.

1462
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:24,920
Some random guy went and surrendered
claiming to have committed the murder.

1463
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,280
But everyone knows he didn't do it.

1464
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:30,680
I searched everywhere
for the murderer.

1465
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:34,440
Two days later, we caught the driver
of the murderer.

1466
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:42,120
Do you know why they killed my son?

1467
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:10,120
Can you hear anything?

1468
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:12,280
You can't?

1469
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:15,600
It does seem like you can hear.

1470
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:21,880
Maybe you can hear a little bit?

1471
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:24,200
- Hey...
- Yes, boss?

1472
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:25,720
- Go inside and talk.
- Okay.

1473
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:27,000
Quick.

1474
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:30,680
Boss? Can you hear me?

1475
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:32,880
I can hear.

1476
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:34,520
Oh, shucks.

1477
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:36,560
It can be heard.

1478
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:40,360
Come on, dear.
Run along.

1479
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:45,280
Come on!

1480
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:47,560
How long have you been
eavesdropping on us?

1481
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:50,040
Who are you?
How did you get in?

1482
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:52,280
Tell me.

1483
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:53,920
It was a mistake.

1484
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:56,720
You followed us here, didn't you?

1485
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:58,880
We've become friends now.
Tell me.

1486
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:00,840
You followed us here, didn't you?

1487
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:05,840
So, under that bridge...

1488
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:10,560
Boss, his ID card.

1489
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:18,840
Oh, you're a reporter?

1490
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:20,640
You never mentioned.

1491
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:24,240
So, you were eavesdropping on us.

1492
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:25,960
What were we talking inside?

1493
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,040
I couldn't hear.

1494
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:28,520
Tell me, dude!

1495
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:30,560
Tell me, tell me, tell me.

1496
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:31,720
Tell me.

1497
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:35,480
The court verdict is on December 26th.

1498
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:37,080
Yes, it is.

1499
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:39,920
The next day, you're going to
Kodambakkam Railway station and...

1500
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:41,440
Going to the railway station and...?

1501
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:44,000
Murder a girl...

1502
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:45,960
Me? Murder a girl?

1503
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,040
Oh, God!

1504
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:50,080
Okay, what will you do
with all this knowledge?

1505
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:51,800
You'll go to the police?

1506
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:53,240
You'll write an article?

1507
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:55,720
What will you do?
You'll do nothing.

1508
01:29:58,360 --> 01:29:59,680
You're scared?

1509
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:03,160
Get back! Back!

1510
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:05,000
Tell me.

1511
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:06,960
Don't be afraid, okay?

1512
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,120
Yes!

1513
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:09,760
How could I not be afraid?

1514
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:12,000
It's your house.
Your men are surrounding me.

1515
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:13,240
Of course I'm afraid.

1516
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:15,040
Are you some brave man?

1517
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:18,040
You're the guy that hides behind a kerchief
and murders someone under a bridge.

1518
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:21,120
Let me see you try to stand alone
and murder someone in public.

1519
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:23,320
Oh... what if I do it?

1520
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:27,320
That's it.
The public would destroy you.

1521
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:30,360
Like hell they will.

1522
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:33,400
When I pull out a knife in public,
everyone will scatter away in fear.

1523
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:34,960
They'd stand around and watch.

1524
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,800
Standing around and watching
is a thing of the past.

1525
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:38,200
People have changed now.

1526
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:39,320
They've changed?

1527
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:41,920
Haven't you seen those
murder videos on YouTube?

1528
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,480
Not one soul will come forward.
That's who they are.

1529
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:47,720
Their maximum courage is to record
a video on their mobiles.

1530
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:50,600
Ask the man recording the video
to take one step forward?

1531
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:51,600
He won't come.

1532
01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:53,280
No, he will definitely come.

1533
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:55,200
- He won't come.
- He will.

1534
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:57,000
Only one person needs
to step forward.

1535
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:58,760
Then everyone will follow.

1536
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:01,320
Now you're talking.

1537
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:04,160
When one person steps forward,
others will follow.

1538
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:05,880
But such a person doesn't exist.

1539
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:07,520
- He will come.
- He won't come.

1540
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:09,040
- He will come.
- He won't come.

1541
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:12,240
- He will come!
- God, what's with you?

1542
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,000
Fine...

1543
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:15,840
Let's do three things.

1544
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:17,480
One: Let's kill you.

1545
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:21,720
Two: I've never murdered anyone
in a railway station before.

1546
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:23,160
So I'll do a demo round with you.

1547
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:25,800
Three: This is the most important point.

1548
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:28,280
You challenged me saying
someone will come?

1549
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:30,560
I will prove to you
that no one will come.

1550
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:31,800
It's time!

1551
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:34,320
The college boys would be there.
Let's get going.

1552
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:37,920
My glasses!

1553
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:41,880
Play some music?

1554
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:43,080
Okay, boss.

1555
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:47,160
"The jasmine flower on the creeper..."

1556
01:31:47,320 --> 01:31:51,040
"...scents so fragrant, my dear"

1557
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:54,720
"Shall I take and offer it to you?"

1558
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:57,880
"I am very much eager, my sweetie pie"

1559
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:02,120
"Provokes me to pluck it at once"

1560
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:05,800
"...this vast jasmine garden"

1561
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:08,960
"But stops me to reach it..."

1562
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:12,840
"...by the shyness inside my heart"

1563
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:33,320
"Which direction to take to fly?"

1564
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:37,000
"This bird doesn't know anything"

1565
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:41,040
"Pity, do not know of its kith and kin"

1566
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:43,920
I will ask you one last time.

1567
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:46,320
Will that someone step forward or not?

1568
01:32:57,360 --> 01:32:58,440
He will.

1569
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:01,960
"The jasmine flower on the creeper..."

1570
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:05,120
"...scents so fragrant, my sweetheart"

1571
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:09,240
"Shall I say 'yes' to accept
or 'no' to refuse...?"

1572
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:11,960
"I am very much confused"

1573
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:13,760
Oh, I'm out of breath.

1574
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:15,960
I am panting.

1575
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:18,400
Is this spot okay?
It's crowded.

1576
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,680
It's more crowded over there.

1577
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:42,280
This is a good crowd.

1578
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:45,800
So?

1579
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:48,680
When I brandish my knife,
these people will step forward?

1580
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:05,080
See? Didn't I tell you?

1581
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:08,000
Didn't I tell you these people are useless,
that they won't come?

1582
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:31,920
Standing by and watching
is a thing of the past?

1583
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:38,480
A thing of the past?

1584
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:45,280
Someone from the public will step forward
and destroy me?

1585
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:47,240
Die!

1586
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:51,080
Public...

1587
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:00,720
For a second there,
even I got scared hearing your words.

1588
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:04,000
I thought someone might come forward.

1589
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:24,920
He is a mad man.

1590
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:27,160
A mad man.

1591
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:30,040
Mad man!

1592
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:04,360
Who are you?

1593
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:07,720
Where did you come from?

1594
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:10,200
This was unnecessary...

1595
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:15,840
Ten seconds before you die...

1596
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:17,840
I wish to tell you something.

1597
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:21,760
I want you to die
while listening to it.

1598
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,960
There's a pulse.
There is, there is.

1599
01:36:37,680 --> 01:36:38,960
It's dropping!

1600
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,240
It's dropping, man.

1601
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:47,280
That someone you mentioned...
he never did come.

1602
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:03,720
Till the very end, my son believed
that the people will step forward.

1603
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:08,760
He didn't know reality,
that no one will come.

1604
01:37:10,160 --> 01:37:11,280
He died.

1605
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:14,640
He died watching that crowd.

1606
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:19,600
But think about it, what my son said
was correct.

1607
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:22,760
At least one person
should have stepped forward that day.

1608
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:24,880
We have grown up wrong.

1609
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:27,840
The crowd that stood and watched
was a selfish crowd.

1610
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:31,840
They only care about their daily meal.
They don't care if others starve.

1611
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:35,400
Ask him who is his area's MLA?
He won't know.

1612
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:38,200
A mad man is enough to rule them.

1613
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:40,360
And I have made it happen.

1614
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:42,320
Mani, the MLA.

1615
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:47,840
In our country, no one will help
even if someone is murdered in public.

1616
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:51,040
With that confidence, they are going to
murder a girl tomorrow.

1617
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:52,760
This time, I won't let that happen.

1618
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:56,200
That one person my son needed
shall be there to step forward.

1619
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:59,040
I will tell him
that the man he needed has arrived.

1620
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:01,160
My son would be watching, wouldn't he?

1621
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:03,040
He would be happy, wouldn't he?

1622
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:05,880
That's why I asked you to go there.

1623
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:09,960
Do you know why I chose you both?

1624
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:13,160
When I found out who murdered my son...

1625
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:16,760
I came to the mall determined
to chop his head off his body.

1626
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:19,280
He was sitting in the table
next to mine.

1627
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:23,280
If you had placed that knife on my throat
two seconds later...

1628
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:25,360
that man would have been headless.

1629
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:28,600
You brought my son back
right before my eyes.

1630
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:31,920
That's when I began to understand.

1631
01:38:31,960 --> 01:38:34,640
When you told me what it meant
to exact revenge...

1632
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:37,760
I realised how foolish I have been
all this time.

1633
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:41,160
I know you weren't
serious about anything.

1634
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:42,960
But you were right.

1635
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:48,400
If I had killed him then and there,
no one would have stepped forward.

1636
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:51,040
My son would have lost
all over again.

1637
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:54,560
I wanted to complete this task with
the men who made me understand this.

1638
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:55,920
Tell me now.

1639
01:38:55,960 --> 01:38:58,240
Will you prevent that murder tomorrow?

1640
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:03,160
We can't, sir.

1641
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:04,320
You can't?

1642
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:05,560
Sir...

1643
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:08,160
Everything you say is fair.

1644
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:11,680
We do feel sorry for your son.

1645
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:15,400
Based on what you've said...

1646
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:17,880
Sounds like the murderer
is a big-shot.

1647
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:20,040
If I go there,
I will definitely die.

1648
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:22,720
Think about it practically.

1649
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:24,560
What's your final decision?

1650
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:28,240
We...

1651
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:29,840
don't want to go.

1652
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:33,120
Let's not talk about the money now.

1653
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:36,000
We'll take leave now.

1654
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:39,960
I confided all this in you
because I considered you my sons.

1655
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:43,560
What if this were to happen
to one of you?

1656
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:45,320
Would you still refuse?

1657
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:47,800
Get out.

1658
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:49,880
Get out of my sight.

1659
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:51,120
Get lost!

1660
01:40:02,160 --> 01:40:03,480
That poor boy.

1661
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,760
Why are you constantly thinking about it.
Let it go.

1662
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:10,200
What do you think
was the cause of his death?

1663
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:12,920
The murderer?

1664
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,160
No.

1665
01:40:14,360 --> 01:40:16,520
The fear of the onlookers.

1666
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:21,800
Not one person there thought
the way that mad-man did.

1667
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:23,520
Just let it go, man.

1668
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:25,880
It's Nisha.

1669
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:31,080
I wonder what he would have thought
right before he died?

1670
01:40:31,120 --> 01:40:32,640
Dude, let it go.

1671
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:34,440
You're whining non-stop.

1672
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:38,200
As if we don't have enough on our plates,
you're bothering us, too?

1673
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:41,240
We're discussing something important.
And look what you're doing.

1674
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:42,720
Come on.

1675
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:44,560
At least he won't hit us back.

1676
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:47,320
Why are you messing with 'it'?

1677
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:48,200
Wait, man.

1678
01:40:48,240 --> 01:40:49,760
Where are you from?

1679
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:53,960
Did someone cheat you also after promising
to give you crores for completing tasks?

1680
01:40:55,160 --> 01:40:56,760
Stop beating yourself.

1681
01:40:57,600 --> 01:40:59,400
I know you have
something to say to the world.

1682
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:01,080
Tell me, I'll make sure you're heard.

1683
01:41:01,120 --> 01:41:02,720
Tell me, tell me, tell me.

1684
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:04,360
Siva, Siva, Siva...

1685
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:07,560
It's your name 'Siva' that he's muttering.

1686
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:08,760
It's you.

1687
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:26,920
They are good boys.

1688
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:30,200
After I got a job and moved out,
they had no one to take care of them.

1689
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:32,880
Even I have no one besides them.

1690
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:37,320
Brother! My brother Ram!

1691
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:39,200
How did you become like this?

1692
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:41,600
Oh! Why should this happen to you?

1693
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:46,400
He's bleeding!

1694
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:49,560
Come on, man.

1695
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:51,600
Somebody! Please help.

1696
01:41:51,680 --> 01:41:53,200
It's my brother...

1697
01:41:56,480 --> 01:41:58,360
He's my brother!

1698
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:02,240
Brother!

1699
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,760
Siva, come on.

1700
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:07,320
Come on, man.

1701
01:42:46,680 --> 01:42:47,480
Hello!

1702
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:49,640
- Hello, brother?
- Who is this?

1703
01:42:50,160 --> 01:42:51,000
It's me, Siva.

1704
01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:53,040
Bloody hell! You're still alive?

1705
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:54,280
Where were you gone
all these days?

1706
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:54,880
Bro...?

1707
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:58,400
Because of you both, your brother
has become a mad-man, out on the streets.

1708
01:42:58,440 --> 01:43:00,560
You got an MP's son
caught in the news, right?

1709
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:02,520
His men came looking for you
at your home.

1710
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:06,000
When they realised you weren't home,
they beat the hell out of your brother.

1711
01:43:06,120 --> 01:43:08,600
Even when he was lying unconscious
in the hospital...

1712
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:10,920
he kept calling out your name.

1713
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:14,440
Suddenly, he went missing one day.
We just couldn't find him.

1714
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:17,240
I told him not to trust you dogs.

1715
01:43:18,040 --> 01:43:20,360
Where are you now?

1716
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:23,040
Did you go after some man
who promised you money?

1717
01:43:23,080 --> 01:43:26,640
I wouldn't be surprised.
You'd do anything for money, you--

1718
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:34,760
Siva!

1719
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:35,840
Siva!

1720
01:43:35,880 --> 01:43:37,840
Why are you avoiding me?

1721
01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:41,160
I shouldn't have taken Mani to
the channel office without telling you.

1722
01:43:41,240 --> 01:43:43,840
But you won't even look at my face?

1723
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:47,360
We've never had fun together.
We have never gone out on dates.

1724
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:50,240
But we both know
we're in love with each other.

1725
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:51,920
Fine, Siva.
I'll say it.

1726
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:53,240
I love you.

1727
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:55,280
You could scold me.
You could hate me.

1728
01:43:55,320 --> 01:43:57,160
But I will always love you.

1729
01:44:18,040 --> 01:44:19,280
Siva!

1730
01:44:20,160 --> 01:44:21,360
What happened?

1731
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:22,720
Why are you crying?

1732
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:24,640
Say something!

1733
01:44:25,640 --> 01:44:26,960
What happened?

1734
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:46,080
I have lost.

1735
01:44:47,080 --> 01:44:48,600
I have lost everything.

1736
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:54,120
What do I want? What do I like?
I have lived selfishly.

1737
01:44:55,200 --> 01:44:57,480
But there were people around me...

1738
01:44:58,320 --> 01:44:59,880
I never gave them a thought.

1739
01:45:00,240 --> 01:45:03,720
Six months back, when hunger struck,
I would remember about my brother Ram.

1740
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:07,240
But these past six months, maybe because
I had food even before I got hungry...

1741
01:45:07,280 --> 01:45:09,040
I didn't even remember him.

1742
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:13,520
To prove to me that there is a life
beyond money, here he was...

1743
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:15,000
right here.

1744
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:17,840
He's been loafing around
as a mad man here.

1745
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:20,440
I've been passing by this road
for one month now.

1746
01:45:21,480 --> 01:45:23,600
I don't know how many times
he saw me here.

1747
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:27,000
I feel terrible seeing him
in flesh and blood this way...

1748
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:29,640
think of the two school girls?

1749
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:32,040
They just died.

1750
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:35,760
To everyone else, that was a death.

1751
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:38,000
But to me, that was just news.

1752
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:41,840
I was right there moments before
the two girls died.

1753
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:43,480
Right before my eyes,
a man pinched her waist.

1754
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:44,960
And another man poured her a drink.

1755
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:46,120
But I...

1756
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:48,440
I was just holding a camera.

1757
01:45:51,320 --> 01:45:53,960
If I'd put the camera down,
I could have saved them.

1758
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,040
Those two girls
would still be alive.

1759
01:45:57,480 --> 01:46:00,360
My happiness, my money...
that's all I thought about.

1760
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:08,200
But not anymore.

1761
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:09,680
Now...

1762
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:13,560
that man who is setting out
to murder a girl in public with no fear...

1763
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:17,480
I will stand up to him.

1764
01:46:17,560 --> 01:46:19,840
Are you stupid?
If you stand up to him--

1765
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:21,120
I will die.

1766
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:24,600
I will die.

1767
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:27,880
Because I don't know how to fight.

1768
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:32,400
You think if you stand up,
everyone else will step forward?

1769
01:46:32,440 --> 01:46:33,760
They won't.

1770
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:36,320
Not one of them.

1771
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:39,480
I don't need anyone.

1772
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:42,720
- But I will stand tall.
- Siva...

1773
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:44,760
Whether or not I survive tomorrow...

1774
01:46:45,560 --> 01:46:47,160
I won't let that girl die.

1775
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:01,920
What happened?

1776
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:07,680
"Let me kill you, yaar"

1777
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:09,440
"Let me kill you, yaar"

1778
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:12,080
I see a car approaching.
Let me see if we can get a ride.

1779
01:47:12,160 --> 01:47:14,720
"Shall I finish you off, you tell?"

1780
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,800
"Let me kill you, yaar"

1781
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:20,680
"Let me kill you, yaar"

1782
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:23,400
Sir, we need to go to
the railway station urgently.

1783
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:25,080
Can you help us?

1784
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:51,400
"Let me kill you, yaar"

1785
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:53,840
"Let me kill you, yaar"

1786
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:56,200
"Let me kill you, yaar"

1787
01:47:56,280 --> 01:47:59,040
"Shall I finish you off, you tell?"

1788
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:09,800
'Attention to the passengers'

1789
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:16,000
'Next train to Chennai beach
will arrive shortly on platform # 3'

1790
01:48:16,280 --> 01:48:17,520
Dude...

1791
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:20,400
If we step up,
others will follow, right?

1792
01:48:23,480 --> 01:48:25,640
They may come, or they may not.

1793
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:27,400
I'm going.

1794
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:30,920
Dude, listen.

1795
01:48:31,080 --> 01:48:34,120
It's very difficult for the two of us
to stop the murderer.

1796
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:37,320
Do something.
Stand a little away.

1797
01:48:37,880 --> 01:48:40,160
When I intervene,
he will it me.

1798
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:41,360
You come and save me.

1799
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:43,520
When he hits you,
I will save you.

1800
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:47,560
But here's the thing...

1801
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:50,840
the both of us must not get
trapped by him.

1802
01:48:55,200 --> 01:48:57,320
I am still very scared.

1803
01:48:59,160 --> 01:49:00,680
I am scared, too.

1804
01:49:01,120 --> 01:49:02,400
But we're here now.

1805
01:49:04,760 --> 01:49:06,040
Let's do this.

1806
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:13,400
Siva...

1807
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:15,440
one last time.

1808
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:09,000
"With your heart, for the truth;
Rise and charge!"

1809
01:50:09,080 --> 01:50:12,880
"Your time will come;
Wait and watch!"

1810
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:16,640
"You've cowered in fear for too long;
Not anymore!"

1811
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:20,320
"Like a dam breaking loose;
Rise and charge!"

1812
01:51:21,240 --> 01:51:24,200
"What use is the blood
in the body of a slave?"

1813
01:51:24,280 --> 01:51:28,400
"What use is a home for
coward living in fear?"

1814
01:51:28,600 --> 01:51:31,680
"What use is the blood
in the body of a slave?"

1815
01:51:31,720 --> 01:51:35,760
"What use is a home for
coward living in fear?"

1816
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:42,800
"What is the need to fear torment?"

1817
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:47,360
"You were born with nothing;
Rise and charge!"

1818
01:52:47,800 --> 01:52:51,200
"You can, you can!
Believe in yourself, take the plunge."

1819
01:52:51,240 --> 01:52:55,440
"What's a world without you?
Let go of your worries."

1820
01:52:55,560 --> 01:52:58,520
"You can, you can!
Believe in yourself, take the plunge."

1821
01:52:58,600 --> 01:53:03,040
"What's a world without you?
Let go of your worries."

1822
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:19,920
"It ends one way or the other;
Stand tall and face it."

1823
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:24,440
"Justice shall reward you;
With pomp and fanfare."

1824
01:53:31,320 --> 01:53:34,880
"With your heart, for the truth;
Rise and charge!"

1825
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:38,800
"Your time will come;
Wait and watch!"

1826
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:42,440
"You've cowered in fear for too long;
Not anymore!"

1827
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:45,840
"Like a dam breaking loose;
Rise and charge!"

1828
01:54:19,640 --> 01:54:22,680
Only one man needs to step forward.
Everyone else will follow.

1829
01:54:22,760 --> 01:54:24,320
But such a person doesn't exist.

1830
01:54:24,360 --> 01:54:27,040
He will come.
He will definitely come.

1831
01:54:38,240 --> 01:54:39,680
No, it's fine.

1832
01:54:39,720 --> 01:54:41,920
Brother, thank you so much.

1833
01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:44,600
Thank you?

1834
01:54:45,640 --> 01:54:47,360
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

1835
01:54:48,120 --> 01:54:51,440
It's me you were fighting for
all this time, brother.

1836
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:16,880
"With your heart, for the truth;
Rise and charge!"

1837
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:20,840
"Your time will come;
Wait and watch!"

1838
01:55:20,920 --> 01:55:24,400
"You've cowered in fear for too long;
Not anymore!"

1839
01:55:24,440 --> 01:55:28,160
"Like a dam breaking loose;
Rise and charge!"

1840
01:56:16,400 --> 01:56:19,360
"What use is the blood
in the body of a slave?"

1841
01:56:19,400 --> 01:56:23,680
"What use is a home for
coward living in fear?"

1842
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:26,720
"What use is the blood
in the body of a slave?"

1843
01:56:26,760 --> 01:56:30,920
"What use is a home for
coward living in fear?"

1844
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:38,160
"What is the need to fear torment?"

1845
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:42,320
"You were born with nothing;
Rise and charge!"
