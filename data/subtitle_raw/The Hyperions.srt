2
00:02:45,115 --> 00:02:46,613
Next
stop, Rainey Avenue,

3
00:02:46,655 --> 00:02:48,556
doors open on the left.

4
00:02:49,392 --> 00:02:50,716
Oh my gosh, mommy!

5
00:02:50,758 --> 00:02:52,014
- Mommy!
- Oh my god!

6
00:02:52,056 --> 00:02:53,884
This is
the eastbound E train.

7
00:02:53,926 --> 00:02:55,787
Next stop, Washington Avenue.

8
00:03:00,933 --> 00:03:01,965
Ah.

9
00:03:04,266 --> 00:03:05,126
There you are.

10
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:09,379
Maya told you, didn't she?

11
00:03:10,877 --> 00:03:12,903
Now how would you know that?

12
00:03:12,945 --> 00:03:15,301
She tells you everything.

13
00:03:15,343 --> 00:03:17,684
I think you read my mind.

14
00:03:18,918 --> 00:03:22,583
What did I
say about doing that?

15
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:25,454
Very clever, it's impolite!

16
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,488
Stop it, Vista!

17
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,753
I'm not joking!

18
00:03:27,795 --> 00:03:29,249
You know you're never
allowed in my head.

19
00:03:36,606 --> 00:03:38,830
All right, come
on, hand it over.

20
00:03:38,872 --> 00:03:40,128
Come on.

21
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,261
That's not fair!

22
00:03:41,303 --> 00:03:42,643
Hand it over.

23
00:03:49,685 --> 00:03:53,845
Reading a person's mind,
unless it's for a mission is?

24
00:03:53,887 --> 00:03:55,946
A privilege that
warrants approval.

25
00:03:55,988 --> 00:03:57,460
That's right.

26
00:03:58,991 --> 00:04:03,763
So
where are you going?

27
00:04:07,197 --> 00:04:09,256
I'd like to have an address.

28
00:04:09,298 --> 00:04:10,895
Why?

29
00:04:10,937 --> 00:04:13,326
Well, 'cause I
know Ansel will want

30
00:04:13,368 --> 00:04:14,609
to write to you.

31
00:04:16,646 --> 00:04:18,133
New York City.

32
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,904
Squirreling back to Manhattan.

33
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,684
I have a little gift for you.

34
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,185
It's just your watch.

35
00:04:37,227 --> 00:04:39,693
Oh no, it's a compass.

36
00:04:39,735 --> 00:04:42,795
Matter of fact, it's the
compass my mother gave me.

37
00:04:42,837 --> 00:04:45,567
She told me it would take
me wherever I wanted to go,

38
00:04:45,609 --> 00:04:48,504
bring me home when I was done.

39
00:04:48,546 --> 00:04:50,073
Thanks, I guess.

40
00:04:59,414 --> 00:05:01,110
You hate me.

41
00:05:01,152 --> 00:05:02,584
I beg your pardon?

42
00:05:02,626 --> 00:05:04,120
I read your mind.

43
00:05:06,058 --> 00:05:07,182
Don't think that.

44
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,052
I mean, I don't hate you.

45
00:05:09,094 --> 00:05:12,227
I was a little
frustrated, that's all.

46
00:05:14,033 --> 00:05:17,034
Mind if I ride with
you for a while?

47
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:21,610
Fine.

48
00:05:32,447 --> 00:05:37,351
Stay together,
everybody stay together, come on.

49
00:05:38,288 --> 00:05:39,419
My favorite!

50
00:05:41,225 --> 00:05:43,218
The
Hyperions Family Museum

51
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,122
will be closing in 10 minutes.

52
00:05:46,164 --> 00:05:48,091
Thank you for visiting.

53
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:49,796
The United
States Space Program

54
00:05:49,838 --> 00:05:52,095
calls upon the high
security to assist

55
00:05:52,137 --> 00:05:54,170
in the tests of Earth.

56
00:05:57,582 --> 00:06:00,576
This is a housing
project right here.

57
00:06:00,618 --> 00:06:02,545
This is, people would live here.

58
00:06:02,587 --> 00:06:05,181
This is a five story building.

59
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:23,159
The museum
will be closing very soon.

60
00:06:23,201 --> 00:06:25,326
Please follow the
green exit signs

61
00:06:25,368 --> 00:06:27,262
through the gift shop.

62
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:31,240
Thank you for visiting the
Hyperion Family Museum.

63
00:07:12,118 --> 00:07:13,480
Who's that?

64
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,346
Professor
Mandulbaum here.

65
00:07:18,388 --> 00:07:21,217
The Hyperions and I hope
you had a grand time.

66
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:23,351
Please visit again soon.

67
00:07:23,393 --> 00:07:24,693
- Okay.
- Right.

68
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,229
Yeah.

69
00:07:27,232 --> 00:07:28,158
Oh, ma'am we're closing.

70
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,665
Sir, Ma'am?

71
00:07:29,707 --> 00:07:30,607
Ma'am?

72
00:07:40,344 --> 00:07:41,908
Everybody against the wall!

73
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,075
Ansel, your gun!

74
00:07:44,117 --> 00:07:46,209
Oh, shit!

75
00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:48,541
Get against the wall.

76
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,015
Get against the wall.

77
00:07:50,057 --> 00:07:51,544
Now!

78
00:07:51,586 --> 00:07:54,019
Make a little group,
that's it, together.

79
00:07:54,061 --> 00:07:55,126
Okay.

80
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,132
Ansel?

81
00:08:41,174 --> 00:08:42,712
Ansel!

82
00:08:43,605 --> 00:08:44,707
What's this?

83
00:08:44,749 --> 00:08:45,774
They're locked in.

84
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,475
Locked in?

85
00:08:50,513 --> 00:08:51,747
You work here?

86
00:08:51,789 --> 00:08:52,814
Me?

87
00:08:52,856 --> 00:08:55,212
You, yes, come here.

88
00:08:55,254 --> 00:08:57,115
I need the key to
this display lock.

89
00:08:57,157 --> 00:08:59,282
There isn't a
key to that case.

90
00:08:59,324 --> 00:09:01,757
What do you mean
there isn't a key?

91
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,286
What is this, what
am I looking at?

92
00:09:03,328 --> 00:09:05,486
Fingerprint identification.

93
00:09:05,528 --> 00:09:08,423
It's the only way
to open the case.

94
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,938
Which one of you can open it?

95
00:09:20,048 --> 00:09:22,477
I need to make a phone call.

96
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,314
Distro Chex soap

97
00:09:31,356 --> 00:09:34,856
and American Millimeter
Films present

98
00:09:34,898 --> 00:09:36,700
Professor Mandulbaum's

99
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:39,494
Hyperions!

100
00:09:41,168 --> 00:09:43,194
Where each week we're
invited into the mysterious

101
00:09:43,236 --> 00:09:47,469
headquarters of the world's
only superhero family.

102
00:09:55,413 --> 00:09:59,507
And now your host,
Professor Ruckus Mandulbaum.

103
00:09:59,549 --> 00:10:01,608
Good day, Hyperion
club members.

104
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,984
And welcome to Hyperion Hall.

105
00:10:04,026 --> 00:10:06,349
How are you doing
today, Mercury?

106
00:10:06,391 --> 00:10:07,482
Suit up for adventure!

107
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,891
You can say that
again, old friend.

108
00:10:09,933 --> 00:10:12,322
You know, it's been
nearly 20 years

109
00:10:12,364 --> 00:10:15,622
since the remarkable story
of the Hyperions began.

110
00:10:15,664 --> 00:10:19,527
And nearly 20 years
since I invented this.

111
00:10:19,569 --> 00:10:21,463
The Titan Badge.

112
00:10:21,505 --> 00:10:23,168
I know it doesn't look
like much, does it?

113
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,665
But believe you me,
this little device

114
00:10:25,707 --> 00:10:27,542
packs quite a punch.

115
00:10:28,413 --> 00:10:31,011
Let me show you what I mean.

116
00:10:31,053 --> 00:10:32,573
Everyone you know
from your best friend

117
00:10:32,615 --> 00:10:36,016
to your math teacher is filled
with this magical material.

118
00:10:36,058 --> 00:10:38,150
It's called DNA.

119
00:10:38,192 --> 00:10:40,482
DNA is given to
you by your parents

120
00:10:40,524 --> 00:10:42,748
and acts like a
blueprint for the body.

121
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,190
Everything from eye color
to the shape of your nose

122
00:10:45,232 --> 00:10:48,523
is contained in this
little strand of DNA.

123
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,723
So what does this
little fellow do?

124
00:10:50,765 --> 00:10:54,936
Well, when I make a badge,
I make it for one person.

125
00:10:54,978 --> 00:10:56,762
It plugs into that person's DNA

126
00:10:56,804 --> 00:11:00,502
and changes one piece
of their blueprint.

127
00:11:00,544 --> 00:11:03,373
For example, I can tell the
body to have x-ray vision

128
00:11:03,415 --> 00:11:08,081
or to be able to shrink
to the size of an ant.

129
00:11:08,123 --> 00:11:10,512
So you see, this Titan Badge

130
00:11:10,554 --> 00:11:13,614
can grant an individual
a superhuman power.

131
00:11:13,656 --> 00:11:16,624
Imagine that, a
real life superhero.

132
00:11:17,693 --> 00:11:19,191
So the question became

133
00:11:19,233 --> 00:11:22,095
who do I choose to
give this power to?

134
00:11:22,137 --> 00:11:24,790
I traveled the globe in
search of the brightest,

135
00:11:24,832 --> 00:11:26,902
most selfless young
people on earth,

136
00:11:26,944 --> 00:11:31,038
finally finding three
suitable candidates.

137
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,238
Maya was given the
ability to teleport

138
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,406
from place to place with
nothing more than a thought.

139
00:11:36,448 --> 00:11:40,245
Vista was granted the ability
to read and influence minds.

140
00:11:40,287 --> 00:11:42,445
And Ansel, the youngest
of the children

141
00:11:42,487 --> 00:11:45,481
gained super strength,
becoming the strongest human

142
00:11:45,523 --> 00:11:47,021
ever to live.

143
00:11:47,063 --> 00:11:49,584
I brought the children into
my home where we trained,

144
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:52,895
awaiting the day when their
powers would be needed.

145
00:11:52,937 --> 00:11:55,333
And boy, were they needed.

146
00:11:56,699 --> 00:11:58,699
Adventure!

147
00:12:03,607 --> 00:12:04,606
Exploration!

148
00:12:10,251 --> 00:12:11,481
Heroic rescues!

149
00:12:14,783 --> 00:12:17,249
For 20 years, the
valiant exploits

150
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,581
of Professor
Mandelbaum's Hyperions

151
00:12:19,623 --> 00:12:22,122
have shaped out world.

152
00:12:22,164 --> 00:12:24,131
Calling all Hyperions.

153
00:12:25,332 --> 00:12:26,852
And
for nearly 20 years

154
00:12:26,894 --> 00:12:29,327
we'd been invited each
week to witness retellings

155
00:12:29,369 --> 00:12:31,791
of their unbelievable stories

156
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,603
through the Hyperions
television program.

157
00:12:41,513 --> 00:12:43,209
Follow team leader Maya,

158
00:12:43,251 --> 00:12:45,475
the teleporting Titan!

159
00:12:45,517 --> 00:12:48,511
Vista, the mind-reading
rapscallion!

160
00:12:48,553 --> 00:12:52,185
And Ansel, the
strongest boy alive

161
00:12:52,227 --> 00:12:56,882
as they show the world the
meaning of the world family.

162
00:12:58,233 --> 00:13:00,457
Over the years, the
Hyperions have faced

163
00:13:00,499 --> 00:13:03,724
innumerable threats
both at home and abroad.

164
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:07,200
Our contributions to world
peace are beyond debate.

165
00:13:07,242 --> 00:13:08,868
Members come and go.

166
00:13:10,377 --> 00:13:12,469
Every few years we bid
farewell to the old class

167
00:13:12,511 --> 00:13:15,670
and welcome three new
team members to carry on

168
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,672
the tradition of service.

169
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,345
In fact, just last month,
we announced the end

170
00:13:20,387 --> 00:13:21,841
of our second class,

171
00:13:21,883 --> 00:13:23,953
and the search for our third
generation of team members

172
00:13:23,995 --> 00:13:25,218
has already begun.

173
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,616
So far, we have chosen only one.

174
00:13:27,658 --> 00:13:31,521
Meet Apollo, our
brand new Hyperion.

175
00:13:31,563 --> 00:13:34,491
But the search continues
for the other two.

176
00:13:34,533 --> 00:13:36,973
Could you be the next Hyperion?

177
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,862
Next question,
how's the family?

178
00:13:42,904 --> 00:13:43,837
The family is,

179
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,636
gosh, what is it?

180
00:13:47,678 --> 00:13:48,736
Marvelous.

181
00:13:48,778 --> 00:13:50,045
Marvelous, right.

182
00:13:50,087 --> 00:13:52,476
Look, I can't remember
all these lines.

183
00:13:52,518 --> 00:13:54,610
I mean why are we even
doing this interview

184
00:13:54,652 --> 00:13:55,776
with what was her name again?

185
00:13:55,818 --> 00:13:57,316
Meredith Lane.

186
00:13:57,358 --> 00:13:59,747
She's very influential
with the 15 over demographic.

187
00:13:59,789 --> 00:14:01,525
Sign here.

188
00:14:01,793 --> 00:14:03,520
Once again, how's the family?

189
00:14:03,562 --> 00:14:05,126
Family's fine,
thank you for asking.

190
00:14:05,168 --> 00:14:06,424
They're marvelous.

191
00:14:06,466 --> 00:14:08,129
Marvelous.

192
00:14:08,171 --> 00:14:09,394
Hyperion call.

193
00:14:09,436 --> 00:14:11,099
Sir, Mercury's ringing.

194
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,892
- Let me get that.
- They're going to have to call back later.

195
00:14:12,934 --> 00:14:14,802
We're almost at the studio.
Sign here.

196
00:14:17,543 --> 00:14:18,469
What's your name?

197
00:14:18,511 --> 00:14:19,767
Delano.

198
00:14:19,809 --> 00:14:20,735
Delano.

199
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:21,835
I need you to call this number.

200
00:14:21,877 --> 00:14:23,870
Call it over and over again.

201
00:14:23,912 --> 00:14:25,047
If no one picks up,

202
00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:26,939
hang up and call again.

203
00:14:26,981 --> 00:14:28,941
Do that until you get an answer.

204
00:14:28,983 --> 00:14:31,680
When you do, yell out for me.

205
00:14:31,722 --> 00:14:32,688
Understand?

206
00:14:34,131 --> 00:14:36,916
Are you the real Vista?

207
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,325
Say you understand.

208
00:14:39,367 --> 00:14:40,861
I understand.

209
00:14:48,035 --> 00:14:49,467
What are you doing?

210
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:51,634
What did I just say?

211
00:14:51,676 --> 00:14:53,346
Hah, yeah, no, oh!

212
00:14:54,712 --> 00:14:56,111
So close.

213
00:14:56,153 --> 00:14:58,080
Come on, a little higher.

214
00:14:58,122 --> 00:15:00,775
Oh, good throw, good
throw, like a rocket.

215
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,679
What the hell
is going on here?

216
00:15:03,721 --> 00:15:05,483
Trying to knock down
the security cameras.

217
00:15:05,525 --> 00:15:07,188
Police can tap
right into those,

218
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,783
see right into here.

219
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,290
Who are you?

220
00:15:10,332 --> 00:15:12,820
Olly Pinkletter, I'm the
junior security guard here.

221
00:15:12,862 --> 00:15:14,690
Yeah, Ollie here,
he has some experience

222
00:15:14,732 --> 00:15:16,296
with robbing places
and so you know,

223
00:15:16,338 --> 00:15:17,858
just tell her, go ahead.

224
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,201
I robbed the place across
the street two years ago.

225
00:15:20,243 --> 00:15:22,500
Yeah, he's giving
some advice, that's all.

226
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:23,996
Cameras, knock 'em down,

227
00:15:24,038 --> 00:15:26,669
how to deal with
hostage negotiators.

228
00:15:26,711 --> 00:15:29,903
Oh and, you forgot to frisk me.

229
00:15:29,945 --> 00:15:31,344
Pardon me.

230
00:15:31,386 --> 00:15:33,511
But I think you two need
to tell the rest of us here

231
00:15:33,553 --> 00:15:34,710
what's going on.

232
00:15:34,752 --> 00:15:35,777
Is this real?

233
00:15:35,819 --> 00:15:37,042
Yes ma'am, this is real.

234
00:15:37,084 --> 00:15:38,186
Miss.

235
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,517
- That's what I hate.
- Mr. Ansel.

236
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:40,452
My name is,

237
00:15:41,693 --> 00:15:43,092
Do you mind signing this?

238
00:15:43,134 --> 00:15:44,159
Well I want that too.

239
00:15:44,201 --> 00:15:45,688
I usually take
the bullets out.

240
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,294
Anna, Anna, A.

241
00:15:47,336 --> 00:15:48,724
Would you mind taking
a picture with me?

242
00:15:48,766 --> 00:15:49,989
Maybe try this on.

243
00:15:50,031 --> 00:15:52,057
- I mean not now.
- I was here first.

244
00:15:52,099 --> 00:15:54,697
- I'll show you the exhibits and I know everything.
- How close to the actual plane?

245
00:15:54,739 --> 00:15:56,442
- What did he say?
- Ah!

246
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,384
I have a gun.

247
00:16:05,783 --> 00:16:07,347
Okay?

248
00:16:07,389 --> 00:16:08,454
This is real.

249
00:16:09,787 --> 00:16:11,721
Now, just,

250
00:16:12,823 --> 00:16:14,717
take a seat over there

251
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:17,760
and we'll be out
of here in no time.

252
00:16:19,962 --> 00:16:21,053
Okay, uh,

253
00:16:21,095 --> 00:16:22,692
look, what did he say?

254
00:16:22,734 --> 00:16:23,832
On the phone?

255
00:16:24,637 --> 00:16:26,109
He didn't answer.

256
00:16:27,607 --> 00:16:29,094
He didn't answer?

257
00:16:29,136 --> 00:16:31,734
What are we gonna do?

258
00:16:31,776 --> 00:16:32,966
How are we gonna
get out of here?

259
00:16:33,008 --> 00:16:34,099
What's our next move?

260
00:16:34,141 --> 00:16:35,705
I need a minute to think.

261
00:16:35,747 --> 00:16:37,076
Vis.

262
00:16:38,145 --> 00:16:40,182
Hey, Ollie.

263
00:16:40,224 --> 00:16:42,580
Is there a way to get out of here,
like a loading area or something?

264
00:16:42,622 --> 00:16:44,714
- Oh yeah, actually, if you head down-
- Hey, hey, hey, no.

265
00:16:44,756 --> 00:16:46,045
No, no, no, no, no.

266
00:16:46,087 --> 00:16:48,454
We are not going anywhere
without those badges.

267
00:16:48,496 --> 00:16:49,422
All right, we talked about this.

268
00:16:49,464 --> 00:16:50,588
Okay.

269
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,820
You said this would
take five minutes.

270
00:16:51,862 --> 00:16:53,459
You said we'd be
out of here by now

271
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:54,559
and nothing can go wrong!

272
00:16:54,601 --> 00:16:55,824
Yeah, well you
said that the badges

273
00:16:55,866 --> 00:16:57,496
were only protected by
a single pane of glass

274
00:16:57,538 --> 00:16:59,927
which is what I
based the plan on.

275
00:16:59,969 --> 00:17:02,468
Okay, well yeah, I did say
that, yes, that is true.

276
00:17:07,977 --> 00:17:09,812
Hyperion Family Museum.

277
00:17:13,587 --> 00:17:15,382
It's the police.

278
00:17:15,424 --> 00:17:18,953
They want to talk to
whoever's in charge.

279
00:17:25,896 --> 00:17:26,796
Hey, Vista.

280
00:17:27,535 --> 00:17:28,666
Vista!

281
00:17:30,373 --> 00:17:33,598
What am I gonna do
with these people?

282
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,797
Hey.

283
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:35,871
Hey.

284
00:17:37,171 --> 00:17:38,966
Just give us a minute.

285
00:17:39,008 --> 00:17:41,100
Yeah, you guys
could just, I guess,

286
00:17:41,945 --> 00:17:42,944
Oh boy.

287
00:18:05,672 --> 00:18:07,533
On scene and we
are now in position.

288
00:18:39,266 --> 00:18:40,962
Remember when we
enter, take a moment

289
00:18:41,004 --> 00:18:42,898
to assess the situation.

290
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,571
Assess, plan and act.

291
00:18:45,613 --> 00:18:46,843
Right, okay.

292
00:18:48,077 --> 00:18:49,252
Ready?

293
00:18:50,013 --> 00:18:51,144
Yeah.

294
00:18:52,389 --> 00:18:54,041
Yeah, I'm ready.

295
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,885
Remember to breathe.

296
00:19:18,976 --> 00:19:20,342
Shit.

297
00:19:30,152 --> 00:19:32,387
Hello, Maya.

298
00:20:38,462 --> 00:20:39,285
Agh!

299
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,690
Junior Mints.

300
00:20:44,732 --> 00:20:46,857
No, I think we
did really well.

301
00:20:46,899 --> 00:20:48,155
Honestly.

302
00:20:48,197 --> 00:20:49,636
Oh, thank you.

303
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,665
I feel like I did pretty good.

304
00:20:52,707 --> 00:20:54,964
Don't, don't scratch that.

305
00:20:55,006 --> 00:20:57,197
But the hole's itchy.

306
00:20:57,239 --> 00:21:00,042
Gunshots to the
chest can sting.

307
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:04,908
I'd recommend next
time using your power.

308
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:07,878
Turn my skin into metal?

309
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,815
I think it would have made
a difference, don't you?

310
00:21:10,857 --> 00:21:13,147
Yeah, if you think so.

311
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,313
Are you there, Maya?

312
00:21:14,355 --> 00:21:15,490
Are you there?

313
00:21:15,532 --> 00:21:16,722
Go for Maya.

314
00:21:16,764 --> 00:21:19,285
It's a bad connection,
can you speak up?

315
00:21:19,327 --> 00:21:20,990
Excuse me, I beg your pardon.

316
00:21:21,032 --> 00:21:23,124
Thank you so much.

317
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:24,165
Hello?

318
00:21:25,069 --> 00:21:27,128
Yes, I need you back right away.

319
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:28,866
The news is saying there's
a hostage situation

320
00:21:28,908 --> 00:21:30,736
at the museum!

321
00:21:30,778 --> 00:21:33,167
Somebody's attempting
to pinch my shit!

322
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:34,872
Wait, are you alone?

323
00:21:34,914 --> 00:21:36,236
Did I say shit?

324
00:21:36,278 --> 00:21:37,277
On my way.

325
00:21:38,786 --> 00:21:40,174
Maya.

326
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,599
Speaking French.

327
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:01,030
<i>Merci.</i>

328
00:22:01,072 --> 00:22:02,262
Looks like you're
gonna be staying

329
00:22:02,304 --> 00:22:04,231
with Dr. Charles
for the week, okay?

330
00:22:04,273 --> 00:22:06,167
Do you want the remote?

331
00:22:06,209 --> 00:22:07,135
Who's Dr. Charles?

332
00:22:07,177 --> 00:22:08,037
Where am I?

333
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:09,111
Paris.

334
00:22:10,884 --> 00:22:11,777
Every time I stay here,

335
00:22:11,819 --> 00:22:14,241
I beg Dr. Charles to get cable.

336
00:22:14,283 --> 00:22:15,755
Oh, MASH.

337
00:22:16,417 --> 00:22:17,750
Who's Dr. Charles?

338
00:22:17,792 --> 00:22:20,463
Oh, he's our
private physician.

339
00:22:22,093 --> 00:22:23,921
Look, do me a favor.

340
00:22:23,963 --> 00:22:25,890
It's very important you
don't tell the Professor

341
00:22:25,932 --> 00:22:27,760
about your injury.

342
00:22:27,802 --> 00:22:30,224
Don't tell him about Dr.
Charles either, okay?

343
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:31,606
Yeah, of course.

344
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,169
Why?

345
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:39,233
There are some details the
public shouldn't know about.

346
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:41,609
And since the Professor's
the face of the team,

347
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,072
we wouldn't wanna put
him in a situation

348
00:22:43,114 --> 00:22:46,108
where he'd have to lie
to the public, would we?

349
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:48,913
Hey Maya,
what's your ETA?

350
00:22:48,955 --> 00:22:50,152
Leaving now.

351
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,481
Sergeant, I don't
want you to worry a bit.

352
00:22:56,523 --> 00:22:57,988
I've written every
single word you've said

353
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,990
in my notebook.

354
00:23:00,032 --> 00:23:03,125
I won't let you down again, sir.

355
00:23:03,167 --> 00:23:04,298
Over and out.

356
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,261
All units,
we have a code 805,

357
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,544
repeat, code 805.

358
00:23:10,207 --> 00:23:13,135
All right people,
look alive, goddamit!

359
00:23:13,177 --> 00:23:14,433
Sergeant Burns just confirmed

360
00:23:14,475 --> 00:23:17,106
that we've got a
Hyperion en route.

361
00:23:17,148 --> 00:23:19,654
Not a good time to look stupid.

362
00:23:20,888 --> 00:23:22,184
Oh God.

363
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,411
Hey, Fitzpatrick, come here.

364
00:23:25,453 --> 00:23:27,116
I locked my keys in the car.

365
00:23:27,158 --> 00:23:28,150
Take care of that one.

366
00:23:29,292 --> 00:23:31,864
Are you
Captain Woodcock?

367
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:35,025
Looks like
a hostage situation.

368
00:23:35,067 --> 00:23:37,566
Any idea how
many are inside, demands?

369
00:23:37,608 --> 00:23:39,128
No words
from anybody inside.

370
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:40,965
What about
security cameras?

371
00:23:41,007 --> 00:23:42,835
Cameras inside
are just for show.

372
00:23:42,877 --> 00:23:44,166
Non functional.

373
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:46,102
You've attempted
contact by phone?

374
00:23:46,144 --> 00:23:48,045
They keep hanging up.

375
00:23:49,246 --> 00:23:51,206
Have you tried
knocking on the door?

376
00:23:53,547 --> 00:23:54,682
The
Hyperion Arm Device

377
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,717
attaches onto the forearm.

378
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:58,950
The Titan Badge is
then locked into place

379
00:23:58,992 --> 00:24:00,985
allowing the precision
needle to act as a highway

380
00:24:01,027 --> 00:24:03,731
for the DNA altering
material to,

381
00:24:13,776 --> 00:24:16,238
We've run into
a small problem.

382
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:22,717
Nothing big, but we might need
more time than we discussed.

383
00:24:23,786 --> 00:24:26,373
What constitutes
a small problem?

384
00:24:26,415 --> 00:24:28,045
Nothing, really.

385
00:24:28,087 --> 00:24:30,377
Everything's fine.

386
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:33,215
When will I have them?

387
00:24:36,733 --> 00:24:38,128
I'll call you.

388
00:24:59,514 --> 00:25:01,111
Maya.

389
00:25:01,153 --> 00:25:02,651
Vista.

390
00:25:02,693 --> 00:25:04,213
What are you doing here?

391
00:25:04,255 --> 00:25:06,248
These men think there's a
robbery going on in there.

392
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:07,256
There is.

393
00:25:08,127 --> 00:25:09,416
Well, do you have the thieves?

394
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:10,857
How many are there?

395
00:25:10,899 --> 00:25:12,221
Have you spoken
to the Professor?

396
00:25:12,263 --> 00:25:13,768
Not yet.

397
00:25:14,003 --> 00:25:15,587
Well, let me in, I'll help.

398
00:25:15,629 --> 00:25:16,870
I can't.

399
00:25:17,305 --> 00:25:20,229
I'm the one robbing the place.

400
00:25:20,271 --> 00:25:21,296
You're kidding.

401
00:25:21,338 --> 00:25:22,238
No.

402
00:25:23,373 --> 00:25:25,465
And I need the
Professor right away.

403
00:25:25,507 --> 00:25:27,441
Have you lost your mind?

404
00:25:32,481 --> 00:25:34,309
Don't bother trying
to teleport in here.

405
00:25:34,351 --> 00:25:35,658
I have the cork.

406
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:37,851
You don't.

407
00:25:37,893 --> 00:25:39,248
What is the cork?

408
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:43,450
Well, this little device
acts as my security system

409
00:25:43,492 --> 00:25:46,255
in preventing any abuse
in power that may come

410
00:25:46,297 --> 00:25:49,555
from granting the
Hyperions super powers.

411
00:25:49,597 --> 00:25:51,425
With one push of a button,

412
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:54,769
I am able to generate
a power-free radius

413
00:25:54,811 --> 00:25:58,300
where none of the Titan
badges can function.

414
00:25:58,342 --> 00:25:59,972
Let me give you an example.

415
00:26:00,014 --> 00:26:02,843
Take this dashing super
powered Hyperion Team member.

416
00:26:02,885 --> 00:26:03,635
Mmm?

417
00:26:03,677 --> 00:26:04,845
Yes, you.

418
00:26:04,887 --> 00:26:06,473
Would you mind showing
us what happens

419
00:26:06,515 --> 00:26:10,180
when you attempt to use
your power in the cork zone?

420
00:26:17,328 --> 00:26:18,925
You stole the cork?

421
00:26:18,967 --> 00:26:19,959
How did you get it?

422
00:26:20,001 --> 00:26:21,290
It doesn't matter.

423
00:26:21,332 --> 00:26:23,490
The inside of this museum
is off limits to you.

424
00:26:23,532 --> 00:26:25,360
Vista, you're
making a big mistake.

425
00:26:25,402 --> 00:26:26,691
We need the Professor now,

426
00:26:26,733 --> 00:26:28,000
we don't have much time.

427
00:26:28,042 --> 00:26:28,876
Who's we?

428
00:26:30,209 --> 00:26:32,906
I, I need the Professor.

429
00:26:32,948 --> 00:26:35,634
Did you seriously
drag Ansel into this?

430
00:26:35,676 --> 00:26:37,372
Bring him here.

431
00:26:38,745 --> 00:26:41,013
What the hell
are you thinking?

432
00:26:41,055 --> 00:26:44,386
Holding up the museum,
taking hostages?

433
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,547
And then you have the
nerve to make demands of me

434
00:26:47,589 --> 00:26:49,028
and your father.

435
00:26:50,064 --> 00:26:51,386
You don't get to do
that, young lady.

436
00:26:51,428 --> 00:26:53,993
Drop the weird
babysitter routine, Maya.

437
00:26:54,035 --> 00:26:56,831
I'm not trying to be
your goddamn babysitter.

438
00:26:56,873 --> 00:26:59,658
I'm trying to talk to
you one adult to another.

439
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,935
What are you doing here?

440
00:27:01,977 --> 00:27:05,235
I just need the
Professor to come.

441
00:27:05,277 --> 00:27:06,335
That's all this is?

442
00:27:06,377 --> 00:27:08,909
Some bizarre way
of reconnecting?

443
00:27:08,951 --> 00:27:10,702
This has nothing
to do with you.

444
00:27:10,744 --> 00:27:12,407
Of course it does!

445
00:27:12,449 --> 00:27:13,815
You abandoned us 10 years ago

446
00:27:13,857 --> 00:27:15,278
like a spoiled brat.

447
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,545
And then out of nowhere
you hold up the museum.

448
00:27:18,587 --> 00:27:20,928
And dragging Ansel into it?

449
00:27:23,229 --> 00:27:24,800
I'm trapped, Maya.

450
00:27:27,266 --> 00:27:29,457
Let me get you and
Ansel out of here.

451
00:27:29,499 --> 00:27:30,260
I can't.

452
00:27:30,302 --> 00:27:32,031
I'll take you home.

453
00:27:32,073 --> 00:27:35,364
I can't, I can't go anywhere.

454
00:27:35,406 --> 00:27:36,937
This is gonna break
your father's heart.

455
00:27:36,979 --> 00:27:38,202
Don't call him that.

456
00:27:38,244 --> 00:27:39,731
Don't call him what?

457
00:27:39,773 --> 00:27:40,941
He's not my father!

458
00:27:40,983 --> 00:27:42,602
Vista, be gentle.

459
00:27:42,644 --> 00:27:45,242
You've both made mistakes.

460
00:27:45,284 --> 00:27:46,481
I was a kid.

461
00:27:47,517 --> 00:27:50,511
I was allowed to make mistakes.

462
00:27:50,553 --> 00:27:52,183
How many apology letters
do I have to write?

463
00:27:52,225 --> 00:27:53,745
I sent hundreds.

464
00:27:53,787 --> 00:27:57,485
And all the while he just
dragged my name through the mud

465
00:27:57,527 --> 00:27:59,421
for like 10 years,
as if cutting me off

466
00:27:59,463 --> 00:28:00,862
in every way wasn't enough?

467
00:28:00,904 --> 00:28:02,655
I wake up every other night

468
00:28:02,697 --> 00:28:05,460
with lingering pains
from years of injuries.

469
00:28:05,502 --> 00:28:09,068
Broken bones, gunshot
wounds, stab wounds,

470
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,307
I was stabbed!

471
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:15,602
He wasn't always
aware of everything.

472
00:28:15,644 --> 00:28:16,471
Oh, please.

473
00:28:16,513 --> 00:28:17,545
Vista.

474
00:28:18,812 --> 00:28:20,772
Don't be so eager to
destroy the man's legacy.

475
00:28:20,814 --> 00:28:22,345
He cares about you.

476
00:28:22,387 --> 00:28:24,853
He cares about the team,
not the people on it.

477
00:28:24,895 --> 00:28:26,745
And I'm no longer an employee.

478
00:28:26,787 --> 00:28:28,714
You're wrong. Ruckus has never
just thought of us as employees.

479
00:28:28,756 --> 00:28:29,682
Not you, at least.

480
00:28:29,724 --> 00:28:31,024
What's that supposed to mean?

481
00:28:31,066 --> 00:28:31,959
Come on, Maya.

482
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,752
You were always the favorite.

483
00:28:33,794 --> 00:28:36,491
Ruckus cares about
all of us equally.

484
00:28:39,734 --> 00:28:41,140
Vista!

485
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:47,707
Don't forget which one
of us used to read minds.

486
00:28:53,352 --> 00:28:54,608
Leave your men
outside of the building.

487
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:55,884
Nobody enters.

488
00:28:55,926 --> 00:28:57,024
Yes, ma'am.

489
00:29:01,855 --> 00:29:03,261
Maya.

490
00:29:03,934 --> 00:29:05,934
Just give me a moment.

491
00:29:07,201 --> 00:29:09,194
Look, I know I'm not
supposed to be seen in public-

492
00:29:11,634 --> 00:29:13,330
I'm kind of in the
middle of something, Ares.

493
00:29:13,372 --> 00:29:14,298
I completely understand.

494
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,497
I don't wanna be a bother.

495
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:16,938
Wait, what country is this?

496
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,500
Is this Idaho?

497
00:29:18,542 --> 00:29:20,172
What's on your mind, Ares?

498
00:29:20,214 --> 00:29:22,911
Maya, I wanna be
back on the team.

499
00:29:22,953 --> 00:29:25,111
I could train like you did.

500
00:29:25,153 --> 00:29:27,080
I'm a Hyperion
through and through.

501
00:29:27,122 --> 00:29:29,214
- Ares.
- Look, I know the Professor and I

502
00:29:29,256 --> 00:29:30,512
have had our fair
share of headbutting.

503
00:29:30,554 --> 00:29:31,843
I wasn't perfect.

504
00:29:31,885 --> 00:29:33,317
Hell, sometimes I
was even a burden.

505
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:35,484
But look at these!

506
00:29:35,526 --> 00:29:36,881
I've photocopied
some news articles

507
00:29:36,923 --> 00:29:39,620
I believe highlights some
of the great work I've done.

508
00:29:39,662 --> 00:29:40,720
Like this one, when I assisted

509
00:29:40,762 --> 00:29:43,063
in the Atlantic
Pipeline rupture.

510
00:29:43,105 --> 00:29:45,934
Or this one when I assisted
in the USS Sherman expedition.

511
00:29:45,976 --> 00:29:47,628
And I didn't even
complain when I was asked

512
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:50,037
to supervise
negotiations in Korea.

513
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:53,172
Even though the dear
leader was super handsy.

514
00:29:53,214 --> 00:29:56,538
Ares, please be understanding.

515
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,441
You've done a wonderful job.

516
00:29:58,483 --> 00:30:00,879
I could do more, Maya.

517
00:30:02,223 --> 00:30:06,317
The Professor's firm
on this, it's time to go.

518
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:08,220
You're gonna have all the
money you'll ever need.

519
00:30:10,132 --> 00:30:12,290
Don't make waves again.

520
00:30:12,332 --> 00:30:13,760
Let it go.

521
00:30:20,769 --> 00:30:22,571
You go home now, Ares.

522
00:30:41,625 --> 00:30:43,255
What
happened, who was it?

523
00:30:43,297 --> 00:30:44,685
Maya.

524
00:30:44,727 --> 00:30:47,127
Hey, what's your name again?

525
00:30:47,169 --> 00:30:48,425
Delano.

526
00:30:48,467 --> 00:30:50,460
Can you give
me a hand up here?

527
00:30:50,502 --> 00:30:51,857
What did Maya say?

528
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:53,628
She's
bringing the Professor.

529
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:55,102
- Delano.
- Yes?

530
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:57,401
I need you to help
me block this door, okay?

531
00:30:57,443 --> 00:30:58,699
So maybe some boxes.

532
00:30:58,741 --> 00:30:59,733
Do you have anything bigger?

533
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:01,009
Yeah.

534
00:31:01,051 --> 00:31:02,868
- What else have you got?
- I was thinking about

535
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:04,507
what we talked about
earlier, remember?

536
00:31:04,549 --> 00:31:06,245
If things were
to get out of hand,

537
00:31:06,287 --> 00:31:08,610
instead of just handing
over the badges,

538
00:31:08,652 --> 00:31:10,546
why don't we just use 'em?

539
00:31:10,588 --> 00:31:12,119
It hasn't come to that yet.

540
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:15,749
Yeah but I still kind of think
we should at least be ready

541
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:17,131
to use the powers.

542
00:31:19,696 --> 00:31:21,003
Ansel.

543
00:31:22,534 --> 00:31:23,922
I need to know that
you're doing this

544
00:31:23,964 --> 00:31:25,627
for the same reason I am.

545
00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:26,991
Oh, of course,

546
00:31:27,033 --> 00:31:28,663
this is about Ruby,
getting your daughter back.

547
00:31:28,705 --> 00:31:29,631
- Right.
- Yeah.

548
00:31:29,673 --> 00:31:31,600
So we stick to the plan.

549
00:31:31,642 --> 00:31:33,635
We do what they ask,
give them the badges

550
00:31:33,677 --> 00:31:35,142
and they'll let her go.

551
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:38,046
Okay, but how do we
know that they will?

552
00:31:38,088 --> 00:31:40,147
If we were to use the badges,

553
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:42,006
it just would make
more sense if,

554
00:31:42,048 --> 00:31:43,355
Ansel.

555
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:49,229
You know that the badges
don't make you happy.

556
00:31:50,331 --> 00:31:51,686
You're so much
more than some guy

557
00:31:51,728 --> 00:31:54,663
who can lift a
car over his head.

558
00:31:56,139 --> 00:31:58,825
Besides, how many
people need cars

559
00:31:58,867 --> 00:32:01,571
lifted over their heads anyway?

560
00:32:17,127 --> 00:32:19,978
Our guest this evening
requires no introduction.

561
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,123
He is known and beloved
throughout the world

562
00:32:22,165 --> 00:32:24,917
as the father and
leader of the world's

563
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:28,019
most famous family
of superheroes.

564
00:32:28,061 --> 00:32:31,660
He is of course, Professor
Ruckus Mandulbaum.

565
00:32:31,702 --> 00:32:33,728
Welcome to the show, Professor.

566
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:36,236
Thank you for
having me, Meredith.

567
00:32:36,278 --> 00:32:38,766
I suppose we should
also welcome Mercury.

568
00:32:38,808 --> 00:32:39,734
Yes.

569
00:32:39,776 --> 00:32:41,505
Say hello, Mercury.

570
00:32:41,547 --> 00:32:42,935
Adventure awaits!

571
00:32:42,977 --> 00:32:44,244
Brilliant.

572
00:32:44,286 --> 00:32:45,872
And how's the family?

573
00:32:45,914 --> 00:32:47,643
The team is just,

574
00:32:47,685 --> 00:32:50,877
don't tell me, it's right
on the tip of my tongue.

575
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:52,483
Marvelous?

576
00:32:52,525 --> 00:32:54,584
Why yes, yes, thank
you, marvelous, marvelous.

577
00:32:54,626 --> 00:32:56,916
Now you're in the middle of a
transition, are you not?

578
00:32:56,958 --> 00:32:59,523
With the second
team being replaced?

579
00:32:59,565 --> 00:33:02,559
Yes, we are retiring
the second generation

580
00:33:02,601 --> 00:33:07,564
and currently in the process

581
00:33:07,606 --> 00:33:09,896
of finding a new team.

582
00:33:09,938 --> 00:33:12,030
We do have a new member.

583
00:33:12,072 --> 00:33:13,900
- Apollo.
- Yes.

584
00:33:13,942 --> 00:33:15,033
That's me.

585
00:33:15,075 --> 00:33:16,844
And
how is he coming?

586
00:33:19,321 --> 00:33:22,282
I don't know what you're saying.

587
00:33:22,324 --> 00:33:25,747
You adopted children
from the original team.

588
00:33:25,789 --> 00:33:26,814
Vista and Ansel.

589
00:33:26,856 --> 00:33:28,882
Yes, that's correct.

590
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:31,049
But not Maya,
she was an adult already.

591
00:33:31,091 --> 00:33:33,227
No, we hired Maya.

592
00:33:33,269 --> 00:33:35,361
And why was that?

593
00:33:35,403 --> 00:33:37,429
Well, Meredith.

594
00:33:37,471 --> 00:33:38,760
Because the team
would be required

595
00:33:38,802 --> 00:33:40,597
to travel from the
highest mountain

596
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:42,533
to the deepest ocean,

597
00:33:42,575 --> 00:33:44,964
we realized that some
adult supervision

598
00:33:45,006 --> 00:33:48,737
might be necessary
on certain missions.

599
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:50,211
And when I met Maya,

600
00:33:50,253 --> 00:33:51,971
she was a very
responsible young woman

601
00:33:52,013 --> 00:33:55,073
and I knew she would fit in
very well with the children.

602
00:33:55,115 --> 00:33:57,911
Now when you were replacing
the original children,

603
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:01,618
you mentioned the concept
of using robots instead.

604
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,685
Yes.

605
00:34:02,727 --> 00:34:03,950
I was noodling on robots.

606
00:34:03,992 --> 00:34:06,091
But you know, in the end,

607
00:34:07,666 --> 00:34:11,430
to be a Hyperion one must
have heart and compassion.

608
00:34:11,472 --> 00:34:14,433
And of course,
robots can't replace

609
00:34:14,475 --> 00:34:17,542
the soul required
to be on this team.

610
00:34:19,546 --> 00:34:22,001
Well, Professor,
there were many groups

611
00:34:22,043 --> 00:34:24,168
who read into that
original desire

612
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:26,808
to use robots as a
sign that perhaps

613
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:29,745
there were more problems
under the surface of the team

614
00:34:29,787 --> 00:34:31,978
than were being revealed to us.

615
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,749
Is that accurate?

616
00:34:33,791 --> 00:34:34,592
Problems?

617
00:34:35,793 --> 00:34:37,324
I can't think of any.

618
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,864
Hello.

619
00:34:45,066 --> 00:34:46,960
Sorry to interrupt.

620
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:49,567
Professor, we have
a bit of a problem.

621
00:34:49,609 --> 00:34:50,601
What?

622
00:34:50,643 --> 00:34:51,371
A problem.

623
00:34:51,413 --> 00:34:52,438
Oh gosh.

624
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,803
I do beg your pardon, but,

625
00:34:54,845 --> 00:34:56,310
Problems?

626
00:34:56,352 --> 00:34:59,676
Not really, just late
for an appointment.

627
00:34:59,718 --> 00:35:00,908
So sorry.

628
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:03,680
Thank you.

629
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:08,008
Hyperion Hall,
known throughout the world

630
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:11,385
as the headquarters of the
world famous superhero team.

631
00:36:11,427 --> 00:36:13,717
Behind the walls of
this elegant structure,

632
00:36:13,759 --> 00:36:15,389
world leaders have
sought the assistance

633
00:36:15,431 --> 00:36:17,149
of the Hyperions.

634
00:36:17,191 --> 00:36:18,920
It is also, however, the home

635
00:36:18,962 --> 00:36:21,461
where Professor Mandulbaum
has raised his children.

636
00:36:21,503 --> 00:36:23,925
And like millions of
fathers around the world,

637
00:36:23,967 --> 00:36:26,257
Professor Mandulbaum
has had his fair share

638
00:36:26,299 --> 00:36:28,061
of challenges bringing
up his children

639
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:29,267
Ansel and Vista.

640
00:36:30,974 --> 00:36:33,297
Who can forget the
public rebellions

641
00:36:33,339 --> 00:36:35,442
of his often disobedient Vista?

642
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:38,577
After several very public
attempts at running away,

643
00:36:38,619 --> 00:36:41,547
young Vista in her most
rebellious act of all

644
00:36:41,589 --> 00:36:43,450
publicly condemned the Professor

645
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:45,111
on the eve of her
ill-conceived wedding

646
00:36:45,153 --> 00:36:48,048
to Wes Harrison, the
Andy Warhol superstar

647
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:50,985
and former television
child actor.

648
00:36:51,027 --> 00:36:54,252
In spite of the Professor's
unconditional support and love,

649
00:36:54,294 --> 00:36:56,122
Vista abandoned the family

650
00:36:56,164 --> 00:36:57,992
leaving millions of
concerned citizens

651
00:36:58,034 --> 00:37:01,094
wondering if the team they
had come to love and rely on

652
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:03,965
was on the brink of collapse.

653
00:37:04,007 --> 00:37:06,968
But Professor Mandulbaum
saw an opportunity,

654
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:10,334
an opportunity to refresh the
team that had grown stale.

655
00:37:10,376 --> 00:37:12,578
And so after releasing Ansel,

656
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:15,174
the Professor introduced the
world to three new youths,

657
00:37:15,216 --> 00:37:18,342
leaving Maya to
train the newcomers.

658
00:37:18,384 --> 00:37:21,653
Every few years, the Hyperions
will retire the old class

659
00:37:21,695 --> 00:37:23,017
and welcome the new,

660
00:37:23,059 --> 00:37:25,690
thus ensuring continued
safety for the human race

661
00:37:25,732 --> 00:37:28,088
for generations to come.

662
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:29,958
In the famous words
of the Professor,

663
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,960
"May we forget the
mistakes of our past

664
00:37:32,002 --> 00:37:34,666
and look with anticipation
to the future.

665
00:37:34,708 --> 00:37:38,072
Leave behind the old
and embrace the new."

666
00:37:54,057 --> 00:37:55,049
Grab a pen.

667
00:37:55,091 --> 00:37:57,828
You're about to
make a statement.

668
00:38:02,263 --> 00:38:03,893
It's Vista and Ansel.

669
00:38:03,935 --> 00:38:05,862
They've taken hostages.

670
00:38:05,904 --> 00:38:08,102
Vista and Ansel?

671
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:12,836
I spoke to her, Ruckus.

672
00:38:12,878 --> 00:38:14,101
Face to face.

673
00:38:14,143 --> 00:38:16,946
I bet she talked him into it.

674
00:38:19,115 --> 00:38:20,173
Do the police know it's them?

675
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:21,746
I don't think they
know about Ansel

676
00:38:21,788 --> 00:38:24,144
but they did see her.

677
00:38:24,186 --> 00:38:25,816
In uniform.

678
00:38:25,858 --> 00:38:27,246
In uniform?

679
00:38:27,288 --> 00:38:30,018
Oh, that's just great.

680
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,020
That's just great, that's
just be-loody marvelous.

681
00:38:32,062 --> 00:38:33,461
Ruckus, Vista needs you.

682
00:38:33,503 --> 00:38:35,188
Oh, I bet she does.

683
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,295
I bet she does!

684
00:38:38,068 --> 00:38:39,665
The problem is, Maya,

685
00:38:39,707 --> 00:38:42,030
and you can correct me if I'm
wrong, even though I'm not.

686
00:38:42,072 --> 00:38:43,262
I seem to remember
her telling me

687
00:38:43,304 --> 00:38:45,165
she never wants to see me again.

688
00:38:45,207 --> 00:38:47,772
- Ever.
- She wouldn't tell me what was going on.

689
00:38:47,814 --> 00:38:49,202
Can't you see what
she's trying to do?

690
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:51,006
She's trying to destroy me!

691
00:38:51,048 --> 00:38:52,513
She's in trouble.

692
00:38:52,555 --> 00:38:55,109
Yes, that's a great way
to ask for help, isn't it?

693
00:38:55,151 --> 00:38:56,755
Taking hostages.

694
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:59,080
Wait.

695
00:39:08,065 --> 00:39:10,058
These are how she's
been asking for help.

696
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,796
I thought I told you
to get rid of those.

697
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:13,567
You're making such
a mess in here.

698
00:39:13,609 --> 00:39:15,602
Akiko just cleaned!

699
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:17,164
Every month she writes
you another letter.

700
00:39:17,206 --> 00:39:18,869
The least you could
do is read one.

701
00:39:18,911 --> 00:39:21,102
I don't need to read them.

702
00:39:21,144 --> 00:39:22,400
I know what's in them.

703
00:39:22,442 --> 00:39:24,809
They're probably just
asking for more money.

704
00:39:24,851 --> 00:39:26,811
Why can't you
just let that go?

705
00:39:26,853 --> 00:39:28,241
She was upset.

706
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:29,748
Of course she's upset.

707
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:32,245
Ripped from an orphanage,
dragged to a beautiful mansion

708
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:35,281
where there's, what's this?

709
00:39:35,323 --> 00:39:37,085
Caviar, open trays of caviar

710
00:39:37,127 --> 00:39:39,417
all over the house,
I mean who has that?

711
00:39:39,459 --> 00:39:40,568
Hmm?

712
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:43,487
I mean that's a
little off, but still.

713
00:39:43,529 --> 00:39:45,797
Forced to have
super powers, fame.

714
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,195
Maybe she doesn't care
about the powers and fame.

715
00:39:48,237 --> 00:39:51,099
Who doesn't care
about power and fame?

716
00:39:51,141 --> 00:39:53,805
I mean what is she,
some kind of an alien?

717
00:39:53,847 --> 00:39:56,302
I mean what more can I give?

718
00:39:56,344 --> 00:39:58,850
All I do is give, give, give.

719
00:40:00,887 --> 00:40:04,350
And who's on my side
at the end of the day?

720
00:40:05,595 --> 00:40:07,148
I am.

721
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,321
Nobody.

722
00:40:09,797 --> 00:40:11,665
- I wanna see the cork.
- Hmm?

723
00:40:13,493 --> 00:40:14,393
The cork.

724
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:17,033
You have it, right?

725
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,996
Yes.

726
00:40:20,038 --> 00:40:22,236
I'll never show it to you.

727
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:27,135
You don't lie to me, Ruckus.

728
00:40:27,177 --> 00:40:30,072
Maya!

729
00:40:30,114 --> 00:40:31,711
Oh, sod it.

730
00:40:31,753 --> 00:40:33,082
What did I say?

731
00:40:33,755 --> 00:40:34,754
Maya!

732
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:37,020
Maya?

733
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:42,150
God, I do wish you'd
stop rushing off,

734
00:40:42,192 --> 00:40:45,567
you know how I hate
chasing you like this.

735
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:50,730
Why are you packing?

736
00:40:50,772 --> 00:40:52,963
Are you going somewhere?

737
00:40:53,005 --> 00:40:55,636
How long have you been
lying about the cork?

738
00:40:55,678 --> 00:40:58,232
Do you know how dangerous
that could have been?

739
00:40:58,274 --> 00:40:59,838
What if it fell into
the wrong hands?

740
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,236
Well, it didn't.

741
00:41:02,278 --> 00:41:03,534
Bugger.

742
00:41:03,576 --> 00:41:05,404
Vista said
something today.

743
00:41:05,446 --> 00:41:07,747
It really got me
thinking, Ruckus.

744
00:41:07,789 --> 00:41:09,591
Do share the wisdom.

745
00:41:11,793 --> 00:41:14,479
Can't wait to hear this one.

746
00:41:14,521 --> 00:41:16,217
I'm sure it's a real doozy.

747
00:41:17,227 --> 00:41:18,549
She said you loved the team,

748
00:41:18,591 --> 00:41:20,129
not the people on it.

749
00:41:21,803 --> 00:41:25,200
You don't really
believe that, do you?

750
00:41:26,742 --> 00:41:29,934
I'm not sure what I
believe anymore, Ruckus.

751
00:41:31,307 --> 00:41:33,531
All I know is that I'm tired.

752
00:41:33,573 --> 00:41:36,171
I'm tired of saying
goodbye to people I love.

753
00:41:36,213 --> 00:41:39,713
I'm tired of the fight and
I'm tired of the burden.

754
00:41:39,755 --> 00:41:41,044
Ah.

755
00:41:41,086 --> 00:41:41,946
There you are.

756
00:41:41,988 --> 00:41:43,145
I'm tired of taking sides.

757
00:41:45,959 --> 00:41:48,553
I'm tired of you disappearing.

758
00:41:53,769 --> 00:41:54,966
Look!

759
00:41:56,266 --> 00:41:59,399
I really didn't mean
to rattle your cage.

760
00:42:07,475 --> 00:42:10,304
Would you at least have
the decency to stay-

761
00:42:12,513 --> 00:42:14,480
Ruckus, look at me.

762
00:42:15,483 --> 00:42:17,311
This isn't just about
the cork, Ruckus.

763
00:42:17,353 --> 00:42:19,049
It's about us, all of us.

764
00:42:19,091 --> 00:42:21,788
I wish you would just say
what it is you want to say.

765
00:42:22,798 --> 00:42:25,319
I understand Vista hurt you.

766
00:42:25,361 --> 00:42:27,130
I know you're scared.

767
00:42:28,496 --> 00:42:30,060
I know you loved those two kids

768
00:42:30,102 --> 00:42:33,261
and I know why you dismissed
Ansel when she left.

769
00:42:33,303 --> 00:42:36,737
But Ruckus, I'm not sure
they know how you feel.

770
00:42:36,779 --> 00:42:41,170
Every penny I spent
should have told them.

771
00:42:41,212 --> 00:42:43,403
The PR team said I
had to start fresh

772
00:42:43,445 --> 00:42:45,141
with whole new Hyperions.

773
00:42:45,183 --> 00:42:47,051
What choice did I have?

774
00:42:50,254 --> 00:42:52,346
Like it or not,
you formed a family.

775
00:42:52,388 --> 00:42:55,620
You have two children
and you have me.

776
00:42:56,997 --> 00:43:01,124
We've never understood
where we stand, Ruckus.

777
00:43:01,166 --> 00:43:02,660
What are we to you?

778
00:43:03,465 --> 00:43:04,706
What am I?

779
00:43:05,907 --> 00:43:07,559
Professor?

780
00:43:07,601 --> 00:43:09,000
Yes?

781
00:43:09,042 --> 00:43:10,430
What is it?

782
00:43:10,472 --> 00:43:12,333
I've just received word
that we're about to hear

783
00:43:12,375 --> 00:43:14,302
a prepared statement
from one of the culprits

784
00:43:14,344 --> 00:43:16,535
in the museum hostage situation.

785
00:43:16,577 --> 00:43:17,778
Again, ladies and gentlemen,

786
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,208
this is going to be live.

787
00:43:38,071 --> 00:43:40,005
And five, four, three.

788
00:43:47,047 --> 00:43:49,410
My name is Vista Mandulbaum.

789
00:43:54,351 --> 00:43:56,120
My brother Ansel and I

790
00:43:57,992 --> 00:44:00,091
have taken four hostages.

791
00:44:01,259 --> 00:44:03,615
We've come for one thing,

792
00:44:03,657 --> 00:44:05,749
our Titan Badges.

793
00:44:05,791 --> 00:44:08,356
The badges are currently
locked in a case

794
00:44:08,398 --> 00:44:11,773
that only Professor
Mandulbaum can unlock.

795
00:44:12,798 --> 00:44:14,934
Nobody will leave this building

796
00:44:14,976 --> 00:44:17,273
until we have those badges.

797
00:44:19,178 --> 00:44:21,204
Well.

798
00:44:21,246 --> 00:44:24,504
That appears to be all we're going to be
hearing from the scene, so in summation,

799
00:44:24,546 --> 00:44:26,572
from what we've just heard live,

800
00:44:26,614 --> 00:44:29,384
Professor, what do you think?

801
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:31,617
Yeah.

802
00:44:32,994 --> 00:44:35,456
At least we know where we stand.

803
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:39,222
Dice, you
get to roll first.

804
00:44:39,264 --> 00:44:40,487
All right.

805
00:44:40,529 --> 00:44:42,456
So everyone gets
a pack of cards.

806
00:44:42,498 --> 00:44:43,589
That's for you.

807
00:44:43,631 --> 00:44:44,997
Thanks.

808
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:48,528
And you get to choose
whoever you wanna be, yeah.

809
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:50,365
Was spotted
over the eastern seaboard.

810
00:44:50,407 --> 00:44:51,872
Well, it's
difficult to see

811
00:44:51,914 --> 00:44:53,335
through the
tremendous smoke here

812
00:44:53,377 --> 00:44:55,535
on the streets, but
I believe, I see yes!

813
00:44:55,577 --> 00:44:58,637
Ladies and gentlemen, I
could see Ansel Mandulbaum.

814
00:44:58,679 --> 00:45:00,507
He's carrying, he's
emerging from the haze

815
00:45:00,549 --> 00:45:02,146
and he's carrying,

816
00:45:02,188 --> 00:45:03,675
oh I can't believe
what I'm seeing.

817
00:45:03,717 --> 00:45:06,579
He's carrying the
missile above his head!

818
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:08,955
Ansel Mandulbaum
has saved us all!

819
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:10,550
He stopped the missile!

820
00:45:10,592 --> 00:45:12,585
Ansel has saved countless lives

821
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:15,423
and I have never seen
such a display of heroism

822
00:45:15,465 --> 00:45:17,722
and self-sacrifice
in all my life.

823
00:45:17,764 --> 00:45:20,461
Ansel Mandulbaum, the
Hyperion super team

824
00:45:20,503 --> 00:45:22,727
has caught a rogue
soviet missile.

825
00:45:22,769 --> 00:45:24,663
The crowd is cheering.

826
00:45:24,705 --> 00:45:27,072
What a moment to
witness in person.

827
00:45:27,114 --> 00:45:28,436
Citizens are in tears

828
00:45:28,478 --> 00:45:31,945
and they are reaching out
to thank the young hero.

829
00:45:58,178 --> 00:45:59,705
Hey, Mr. Ansel?

830
00:46:02,545 --> 00:46:04,677
You wanna get in on this?

831
00:46:06,384 --> 00:46:08,872
I'm hot, I'm tired,
this is like flying coach.

832
00:46:08,914 --> 00:46:10,214
- Oh, new player.
- Here you go,

833
00:46:10,256 --> 00:46:11,215
here are your blue cards.

834
00:46:11,257 --> 00:46:12,018
Hey, all right.

835
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,547
You get to roll first.

836
00:46:13,589 --> 00:46:15,989
But first you have
to choose a guy

837
00:46:16,031 --> 00:46:19,619
from the characters
left in this box.

838
00:46:19,661 --> 00:46:21,357
Did someone take Ansel?

839
00:46:21,399 --> 00:46:23,392
I did, I'm Ansel.

840
00:46:23,434 --> 00:46:26,692
I hope you don't have
a problem with that.

841
00:46:26,734 --> 00:46:30,696
I was kinda hoping
I could be Ansel.

842
00:46:30,738 --> 00:46:33,633
Hey, look, let's
see who's in here?

843
00:46:33,675 --> 00:46:34,872
Okay, look there!

844
00:46:36,546 --> 00:46:38,737
Here's Ares, you could be him.

845
00:46:38,779 --> 00:46:41,575
He's pretty neat, he's blue.

846
00:46:41,617 --> 00:46:43,412
Yeah, yeah.

847
00:46:43,454 --> 00:46:45,315
- That's fine, yeah, yeah.
- Great, that's okay?

848
00:46:45,357 --> 00:46:47,185
Okay good, okay good, let's go.

849
00:46:47,227 --> 00:46:49,187
- All right, so.
- Were you there?

850
00:46:59,371 --> 00:47:01,562
Can we all focus here?

851
00:47:01,604 --> 00:47:03,597
Ant, can we all
focus for a minute?

852
00:47:03,639 --> 00:47:06,699
Ansel is supposed
to roll the dice.

853
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:08,906
I don't feel like playing.

854
00:47:14,155 --> 00:47:15,543
Okay, that
was very dramatic.

855
00:47:15,585 --> 00:47:17,215
Okay well he
seemed kinda upset.

856
00:47:17,257 --> 00:47:18,117
You were bullying him.

857
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:19,745
Don't put it on me.

858
00:47:19,787 --> 00:47:23,287
I think he has some
emotional issues.

859
00:47:44,647 --> 00:47:46,482
What'd I do wrong?

860
00:47:47,419 --> 00:47:48,682
No, no.

861
00:47:49,017 --> 00:47:50,908
You haven't done anything wrong.

862
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:54,120
Well, that's
not entirely true.

863
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:56,980
We did warn you about
seeing Vista, Ansel.

864
00:47:57,022 --> 00:47:58,619
I missed her.

865
00:47:58,661 --> 00:48:00,357
She just wanted to talk.

866
00:48:00,399 --> 00:48:03,459
But didn't we tell you
not to talk to her, Ansel?

867
00:48:03,501 --> 00:48:05,593
She wants to ruin the team.

868
00:48:05,635 --> 00:48:07,727
Dad, I'm sorry I saw Vista.

869
00:48:07,769 --> 00:48:09,234
But I wanna stay.

870
00:48:09,276 --> 00:48:12,336
My boy, you've
done a grand job.

871
00:48:12,378 --> 00:48:14,378
Maybe it's for the best.

872
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,341
Now you can be free to
think of all the things

873
00:48:17,383 --> 00:48:18,738
that you would like to do,

874
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:21,411
like what would you like
to be when you grow up?

875
00:48:21,453 --> 00:48:23,090
This, I like this.

876
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:28,583
Well,
the team just feels,

877
00:48:28,625 --> 00:48:30,849
we all feel that
perhaps it's time

878
00:48:30,891 --> 00:48:35,326
for someone else to take
on the responsibility.

879
00:48:35,368 --> 00:48:36,624
Do I have to move out?

880
00:48:36,666 --> 00:48:38,758
Of course not.

881
00:48:40,736 --> 00:48:45,171
Well I'm sure we can secure
you a wonderful place nearby.

882
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:48,643
So you can visit as
often as you'd like.

883
00:49:00,822 --> 00:49:02,485
My point is,

884
00:49:04,023 --> 00:49:06,430
if you need someone to talk,

885
00:49:08,929 --> 00:49:10,724
I'd be more than
happy to volunteer.

886
00:49:10,766 --> 00:49:13,404
Yeah I'll keep that in mind.

887
00:49:40,598 --> 00:49:42,690
Everybody stay here.

888
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,121
Stop right there!

889
00:50:14,093 --> 00:50:15,822
Is he
SWAT or something?

890
00:50:15,864 --> 00:50:17,230
He's not a cop.

891
00:50:17,272 --> 00:50:18,832
Are you?

892
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,598
What
happened to you?

893
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,765
He kicked me in my chest.

894
00:50:24,807 --> 00:50:27,768
Broke the pen in my shirt.

895
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:29,073
My brand new pen.

896
00:50:30,142 --> 00:50:32,153
But who is he?

897
00:50:33,585 --> 00:50:34,940
Don't give me that.

898
00:50:34,982 --> 00:50:36,744
He's yours, isn't he?

899
00:50:36,786 --> 00:50:39,252
How did he get in here?

900
00:50:39,294 --> 00:50:41,947
When will
I have the badges?

901
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:47,432
You're in the building.

902
00:50:51,966 --> 00:50:53,900
I wanna talk to Ruby.

903
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,336
First you
deliver the badges.

904
00:50:57,378 --> 00:50:59,477
No, you put her on now.

905
00:51:03,681 --> 00:51:05,010
Mommy?

906
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:09,190
Hi, honey.

907
00:51:10,853 --> 00:51:11,951
Are you okay?

908
00:51:13,526 --> 00:51:15,394
Where are you?

909
00:51:17,926 --> 00:51:21,624
Mommy's just picking
something up for you.

910
00:51:21,666 --> 00:51:23,204
I'll be right there.

911
00:51:26,165 --> 00:51:28,796
I'm coming to get you.

912
00:51:28,838 --> 00:51:30,002
Okay.

913
00:51:34,844 --> 00:51:37,108
Are they being nice to you?

914
00:51:39,244 --> 00:51:41,479
Are you watching TV?

915
00:51:41,521 --> 00:51:43,316
I'm losing my patience.

916
00:51:43,358 --> 00:51:45,813
You have 30 minutes to
get me those badges.

917
00:52:29,228 --> 00:52:30,403
You're here.

918
00:53:16,143 --> 00:53:21,146
Ah, good evening
everyone.

919
00:53:22,787 --> 00:53:23,911
Let's greet the fans.

920
00:53:23,953 --> 00:53:25,451
- Mhmm.
- And then straight up to Vista.

921
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:27,387
Right, will do.

922
00:53:27,429 --> 00:53:29,114
Ah, hello, hello, how are you,

923
00:53:29,156 --> 00:53:30,555
nice to meet you, hello.

924
00:53:30,597 --> 00:53:31,556
Are they treating you well here?

925
00:53:31,598 --> 00:53:32,887
Very well, thank you.

926
00:53:32,929 --> 00:53:34,152
- Professor, Alvin Delano.
- Hello, hello.

927
00:53:34,194 --> 00:53:35,560
I'm the curator.

928
00:53:35,602 --> 00:53:36,528
Ah, yes, yes.

929
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:37,859
All your creations here.

930
00:53:37,901 --> 00:53:39,564
Quite the stain
you've got there.

931
00:53:39,606 --> 00:53:40,730
Yes, exploding pen.

932
00:53:40,772 --> 00:53:41,962
Hi
Professor, I'm Sarah.

933
00:53:42,004 --> 00:53:43,029
I own the paper.

934
00:53:43,071 --> 00:53:44,470
I have this book
that I used to know.

935
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:46,571
Oh yes yes of course.

936
00:53:46,613 --> 00:53:48,298
What are you gonna say?

937
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:50,971
Just that we need
his thumbprint.

938
00:53:51,013 --> 00:53:52,170
Mr. Professor,
would you please

939
00:53:52,212 --> 00:53:53,479
- sign this for me?
- Yes?

940
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:54,942
Ah, oh, what's this?

941
00:53:54,984 --> 00:53:56,548
It's you,
a mask of you.

942
00:53:56,590 --> 00:53:57,879
Really?

943
00:53:57,921 --> 00:53:59,584
Ha, doesn't really look
like me.

944
00:53:59,626 --> 00:54:01,850
Eh, it's pretty close.

945
00:54:01,892 --> 00:54:04,497
You gonna tell him about Ruby?

946
00:54:12,771 --> 00:54:14,027
Ready?

947
00:54:14,069 --> 00:54:16,359
Yes, I suppose so.

948
00:54:16,401 --> 00:54:19,329
I must say, the hostages seem
pretty upbeat, don't you?

949
00:54:19,371 --> 00:54:20,711
Unnaturally so.

950
00:54:23,342 --> 00:54:24,341
What's this?

951
00:54:35,695 --> 00:54:37,057
Ah, there you are.

952
00:54:43,197 --> 00:54:45,065
Congratulations, Vista.

953
00:54:46,068 --> 00:54:47,962
It's a real fine mess
you've gotten yourself

954
00:54:48,004 --> 00:54:49,069
and Ansel into.

955
00:54:50,875 --> 00:54:52,736
I gotta keep an eye on
those people out there.

956
00:54:52,778 --> 00:54:55,838
Wait, wait, don't
you mean hostages?

957
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,543
I think that's what you
call people you hold

958
00:54:57,585 --> 00:54:58,544
against their will.

959
00:55:01,886 --> 00:55:06,988
You do realize that armed
robbery is a felony, don't you?

960
00:55:08,024 --> 00:55:09,181
You have any idea of the strings

961
00:55:09,223 --> 00:55:09,951
I'm gonna have to pull?

962
00:55:11,896 --> 00:55:14,824
To get you out of this mess, hm?

963
00:55:14,866 --> 00:55:16,155
I'll watch them.

964
00:55:16,197 --> 00:55:17,420
No, you stay right here, Maya.

965
00:55:17,462 --> 00:55:18,762
Why does she have to be here?

966
00:55:18,804 --> 00:55:20,665
I don't know, why does
Ansel have to be here?

967
00:55:20,707 --> 00:55:22,062
Because he's my
partner in this.

968
00:55:22,104 --> 00:55:23,195
Oh, please.

969
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:25,138
It's true.

970
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,314
That doesn't
sound like my boy.

971
00:55:37,383 --> 00:55:38,492
Not my Ansel.

972
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:45,763
Is it true?

973
00:55:47,228 --> 00:55:48,451
What?

974
00:55:48,493 --> 00:55:51,454
That you're half to
blame for this mess?

975
00:55:51,496 --> 00:55:53,258
Maya, would you do me a favor

976
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:55,964
and escort Ansel outside
for a moment please?

977
00:55:56,006 --> 00:55:57,137
Fine.

978
00:55:59,438 --> 00:56:02,234
Shouldn't I at least
stay to help explain?

979
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:03,202
It's okay.

980
00:56:03,244 --> 00:56:05,277
I'll meet you outside.

981
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:19,020
- 15 years and
- Of course the first thing

982
00:56:19,062 --> 00:56:21,220
- that comes out of your mouth is about you.
- Nothing has changed.

983
00:56:21,262 --> 00:56:23,222
- You're still just a spoiled
- You think the whole world

984
00:56:23,264 --> 00:56:24,960
- revolves around you!
- Little child!

985
00:56:25,002 --> 00:56:27,259
- Money, money...
- You have everything anyone could want to have.

986
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:29,294
You won't be satisfied
until you've burned...

987
00:56:29,336 --> 00:56:31,637
Fixate on the one time someone didn't
fall on your stupid precious little line.

988
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:34,581
You're still a spoiled
little child!

989
00:56:38,785 --> 00:56:41,614
It's good to see you, Ansel.

990
00:56:41,656 --> 00:56:42,648
Really?

991
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:44,316
Yeah, of course.

992
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:46,725
I've missed you.

993
00:56:47,992 --> 00:56:51,151
Things aren't the
same without you.

994
00:56:51,193 --> 00:56:52,995
I've missed you too.

995
00:56:58,739 --> 00:57:01,260
Are you still in Detroit?

996
00:57:01,302 --> 00:57:03,676
No, I moved a few years ago.

997
00:57:06,373 --> 00:57:09,873
Now I'm living with
Vista, actually.

998
00:57:09,915 --> 00:57:11,013
Oh, really?

999
00:57:12,753 --> 00:57:15,043
Haven't you been
receiving our checks?

1000
00:57:15,085 --> 00:57:16,183
I have.

1001
00:57:19,485 --> 00:57:22,189
You're sharing
them with Vista.

1002
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:26,358
She needs me.

1003
00:57:27,394 --> 00:57:28,767
Her and Ruby both.

1004
00:57:30,595 --> 00:57:31,704
Who's Ruby?

1005
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:35,393
You're spoiled
and you're selfish!

1006
00:57:35,435 --> 00:57:38,165
You have any idea
what you've done?!

1007
00:57:38,207 --> 00:57:41,201
You and your stupid persona.

1008
00:57:41,243 --> 00:57:43,467
I beg your pardon?

1009
00:57:43,509 --> 00:57:46,041
You don't even know when you're on television
anymore. You can't tell the difference.

1010
00:57:46,083 --> 00:57:49,887
Have I ever met the real
Ruckus Mandulbaum anyway?

1011
00:57:53,959 --> 00:57:55,420
I know who I am.

1012
00:57:56,588 --> 00:57:59,549
I don't have to
prove it to anyone.

1013
00:57:59,591 --> 00:58:01,228
Least of all, you.

1014
00:58:04,233 --> 00:58:06,732
But you want your
little badge, don't you?

1015
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:09,867
You always get what you want.

1016
00:58:09,909 --> 00:58:11,297
That's her.

1017
00:58:11,339 --> 00:58:12,536
That's Ruby Red.

1018
00:58:13,847 --> 00:58:16,841
Why didn't Vista tell
us she had a daughter?

1019
00:58:16,883 --> 00:58:18,106
How old is she?

1020
00:58:18,148 --> 00:58:19,818
She's five.

1021
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:22,539
Want them so badly?

1022
00:58:22,581 --> 00:58:24,079
You think these
little bits of plastic

1023
00:58:24,121 --> 00:58:25,278
will bring you happiness?

1024
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:27,280
Fine, they're all yours,
whatever you want.

1025
00:58:27,322 --> 00:58:28,754
That's all I've
been asking for.

1026
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:32,054
Give, give, give,
that's all I ever do.

1027
00:58:32,096 --> 00:58:33,693
And we have an audience.

1028
00:58:33,735 --> 00:58:35,801
Let the grand show begin.

1029
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:47,142
It's all yours.

1030
00:58:59,794 --> 00:59:01,057
Well?

1031
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:04,698
Aren't you gonna put it on?

1032
00:59:32,893 --> 00:59:34,156
It's a decoy.

1033
00:59:36,996 --> 00:59:38,127
It's a decoy?

1034
00:59:39,526 --> 00:59:41,860
Well of course it's a decoy.

1035
00:59:41,902 --> 00:59:44,489
You don't actually think
I'd allow the real badges

1036
00:59:44,531 --> 00:59:48,841
to be out in the open in a
traveling exhibit, do you?

1037
00:59:51,538 --> 00:59:52,746
Dad, please.

1038
01:00:01,416 --> 01:00:03,218
It's Dad now, is it?

1039
01:00:05,156 --> 01:00:09,184
Ladies and gentlemen, I do
apologize for the delay.

1040
01:00:09,226 --> 01:00:10,482
This'll all be over momentarily.

1041
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:12,550
In the meantime,
please help yourselves

1042
01:00:12,592 --> 01:00:14,486
to some Hyperion juice boxes

1043
01:00:14,528 --> 01:00:16,356
from the gift store.

1044
01:00:16,398 --> 01:00:17,720
You don't understand.

1045
01:00:17,762 --> 01:00:19,491
I understand when
I'm being manipulated.

1046
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:20,800
Ruckus, stop!

1047
01:00:20,842 --> 01:00:22,494
Maya, they're
making me do this.

1048
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:24,364
Enough
of this nonsense.

1049
01:00:24,406 --> 01:00:25,596
Ansel, you can come with us.

1050
01:00:28,212 --> 01:00:29,336
Dad, you need to listen.

1051
01:00:29,378 --> 01:00:30,843
Ruckus, hear them out.

1052
01:00:30,885 --> 01:00:33,241
I've heard all I need to hear.

1053
01:00:33,283 --> 01:00:35,111
You can't leave us!

1054
01:00:35,153 --> 01:00:37,153
They have my daughter!

1055
01:00:40,455 --> 01:00:42,587
Did you say daughter?

1056
01:00:47,429 --> 01:00:48,395
Ruckus.

1057
01:00:57,439 --> 01:00:58,636
Hmm.

1058
01:00:59,305 --> 01:01:01,573
What an adorable little girl.

1059
01:01:03,808 --> 01:01:08,408
Tell me, is she a friend's
kid or a union actress?

1060
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:10,509
Because if she has talent,

1061
01:01:10,551 --> 01:01:14,612
I may be able to use her
in an upcoming episode.

1062
01:01:14,654 --> 01:01:18,491
Do you honestly think
I would lie about this?

1063
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,936
I've seen you do worse.

1064
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:46,189
Don't do this.

1065
01:01:46,994 --> 01:01:48,862
Put it in the case.

1066
01:02:25,395 --> 01:02:27,619
I hope it makes you happy.

1067
01:02:37,572 --> 01:02:41,706
I knew you'd end up abusing
the power I gave you.

1068
01:02:46,284 --> 01:02:48,581
Baby, what are you doing?

1069
01:02:49,650 --> 01:02:51,056
Let's go.

1070
01:02:53,962 --> 01:02:56,094
Don't even listen to him.

1071
01:02:56,921 --> 01:02:58,162
It's ours.

1072
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:19,348
Now you haven't
given me anything.

1073
01:06:44,291 --> 01:06:45,448
- Sir?
- Hmm?

1074
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:46,779
What's
the situation?

1075
01:06:46,821 --> 01:06:49,386
Well there's nothing
more I can do in there.

1076
01:06:49,428 --> 01:06:53,522
So I suggest you go in and
resolve it your way, Captain.

1077
01:06:53,564 --> 01:06:54,655
No, hold that.

1078
01:06:54,697 --> 01:06:56,459
Ruckus, wait.

1079
01:06:56,501 --> 01:06:57,955
Captain, it's a bit
more complicated

1080
01:06:57,997 --> 01:06:59,429
than we expected in there.

1081
01:06:59,471 --> 01:07:01,761
Can you please be
patient and hold off?

1082
01:07:01,803 --> 01:07:04,632
Have the negotiator call
and tell Vista we'll be back

1083
01:07:04,674 --> 01:07:05,930
within the hour.

1084
01:07:05,972 --> 01:07:07,239
Right away, ma'am.

1085
01:07:07,281 --> 01:07:08,768
Nobody enter that
building until we return.

1086
01:07:08,810 --> 01:07:11,177
- Captain!
- Yes, ma'am.

1087
01:07:11,219 --> 01:07:12,805
Oh, Miss Maya?

1088
01:07:12,847 --> 01:07:16,079
We just received
this message for you.

1089
01:07:18,149 --> 01:07:19,614
Professor?

1090
01:07:19,656 --> 01:07:20,912
Hmm?

1091
01:07:20,954 --> 01:07:22,254
Professor, I'm needed
at the White House.

1092
01:07:22,296 --> 01:07:23,915
Can you just go
home and stay there,

1093
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:24,784
we'll talk when I'm back.

1094
01:07:24,826 --> 01:07:25,752
I'm not gonna be long.

1095
01:07:25,794 --> 01:07:26,786
Fine.

1096
01:07:26,828 --> 01:07:28,260
Just teleport me
back to the office

1097
01:07:28,302 --> 01:07:30,790
and then you can read the
President his bedtime story.

1098
01:07:30,832 --> 01:07:32,022
You're not going
anywhere with me.

1099
01:07:32,064 --> 01:07:35,025
You acted like a
stubborn ass back there.

1100
01:07:35,067 --> 01:07:38,303
Well how am I
supposed to get home?

1101
01:07:38,345 --> 01:07:40,602
I had the car brought
here, I'll find you a driver.

1102
01:07:41,843 --> 01:07:44,573
Well what happened
to my driver?

1103
01:07:45,946 --> 01:07:47,477
Ah, for God's sake.

1104
01:07:47,519 --> 01:07:50,172
To heck with it all,
I'll drive myself.

1105
01:07:50,214 --> 01:07:51,356
Ruckus!

1106
01:07:51,886 --> 01:07:53,142
Captain!

1107
01:07:53,184 --> 01:07:55,353
The Professor's never
driven a car before.

1108
01:07:55,395 --> 01:07:56,816
Can you find someone to
drive him home, please?

1109
01:07:56,858 --> 01:07:57,850
On it.

1110
01:07:57,892 --> 01:07:58,653
Thank you.

1111
01:08:04,272 --> 01:08:05,832
That man will do.

1112
01:08:49,416 --> 01:08:50,415
Time's up.

1113
01:08:58,953 --> 01:09:00,517
Excuse me.

1114
01:09:00,559 --> 01:09:02,178
Would you mind picking a station

1115
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:04,917
and sticking to it please?

1116
01:09:06,092 --> 01:09:07,300
Thank you.

1117
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:46,130
Oh, what a day, what a day.

1118
01:09:48,838 --> 01:09:51,634
What are you looking at, hmm?

1119
01:09:51,676 --> 01:09:53,379
Like you're so brave.

1120
01:09:55,647 --> 01:09:57,904
Wanna know what kind
of a day I've had?

1121
01:09:57,946 --> 01:09:59,037
I'll tell you.

1122
01:09:59,079 --> 01:10:01,072
I'm a grandfather.

1123
01:10:01,114 --> 01:10:02,414
Vista has a daughter.

1124
01:10:02,456 --> 01:10:03,448
Suit up for adventure!

1125
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:04,482
Hmm?

1126
01:10:04,524 --> 01:10:06,150
Oh, you wanna see?

1127
01:10:09,628 --> 01:10:10,627
There.

1128
01:10:12,158 --> 01:10:13,124
Yes.

1129
01:10:18,769 --> 01:10:20,032
All the badges.

1130
01:10:21,332 --> 01:10:25,235
They want all the badges to
release my granddaughter.

1131
01:11:03,110 --> 01:11:04,509
Your life's work.

1132
01:11:04,551 --> 01:11:06,914
Yes, yes it is.

1133
01:11:08,214 --> 01:11:10,522
How can you give them away?

1134
01:11:20,193 --> 01:11:22,061
You can't destroy them.

1135
01:11:24,065 --> 01:11:26,223
What choice do I have?

1136
01:11:26,265 --> 01:11:28,199
What else can be done?

1137
01:11:33,173 --> 01:11:34,414
No, this won't do.

1138
01:11:35,978 --> 01:11:38,070
This won't do at all.

1139
01:11:39,982 --> 01:11:41,513
- Sir?
- Hmm?

1140
01:11:41,555 --> 01:11:43,306
Miss Maya insisted that
you stayed at Hyperion Hall

1141
01:11:43,348 --> 01:11:45,044
until her return.

1142
01:11:45,086 --> 01:11:46,375
Tell me.

1143
01:11:46,417 --> 01:11:48,080
How long have you worked for me?

1144
01:11:48,122 --> 01:11:50,016
Oh, 10 years, Professor.

1145
01:11:50,058 --> 01:11:52,920
And in those 10 years
have you ever known me

1146
01:11:52,962 --> 01:11:55,692
not to do whatever I wanted?

1147
01:11:55,734 --> 01:11:56,898
No, sir.

1148
01:11:57,967 --> 01:12:00,895
Although I do appreciate
your concern, Lucy.

1149
01:12:00,937 --> 01:12:02,094
I'm Lucy, sir.

1150
01:12:02,136 --> 01:12:03,194
Hmm?

1151
01:12:03,236 --> 01:12:06,098
I'm Lucy
and she's Marian.

1152
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:07,238
Right, yes.

1153
01:12:08,142 --> 01:12:09,680
Yes, I knew that.

1154
01:12:45,278 --> 01:12:49,115
Ah, okay, right.

1155
01:12:50,316 --> 01:12:52,492
Evening, Professor.

1156
01:12:54,452 --> 01:12:55,451
Hmm, Ares.

1157
01:12:58,027 --> 01:13:00,526
Well, well, well, I
should have guessed.

1158
01:13:00,568 --> 01:13:01,659
We were beginning to wonder

1159
01:13:01,701 --> 01:13:04,090
if you were ever coming back.

1160
01:13:04,132 --> 01:13:05,454
I could be mistaken but I think

1161
01:13:05,496 --> 01:13:07,566
this may be your first
time in a room with a gun.

1162
01:13:07,608 --> 01:13:10,334
Yes, you might be
right about that.

1163
01:13:11,744 --> 01:13:15,233
So.

1164
01:13:15,275 --> 01:13:16,432
Kidnapping eh?

1165
01:13:16,474 --> 01:13:19,171
I learned from the best.

1166
01:13:19,213 --> 01:13:21,008
Oh it's amazing what
other people's kids

1167
01:13:21,050 --> 01:13:22,746
can get done for you.

1168
01:13:22,788 --> 01:13:23,853
Isn't it?

1169
01:13:24,722 --> 01:13:27,179
Yes, well I'm not
entirely sure what it is

1170
01:13:27,221 --> 01:13:29,181
you've gotten done here.

1171
01:13:29,223 --> 01:13:30,820
Oh, I've gotten
the world famous

1172
01:13:30,862 --> 01:13:33,592
Professor Mandulbaum to
hand deliver my Titan Badge.

1173
01:13:33,634 --> 01:13:35,418
Oh, I have it, yes.

1174
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:37,387
I think I'll take it now.

1175
01:13:37,429 --> 01:13:42,300
No, no,
no, I don't think so.

1176
01:13:42,969 --> 01:13:44,295
He doesn't get it, does he?

1177
01:13:44,337 --> 01:13:46,099
He doesn't understand
what it's like.

1178
01:13:46,141 --> 01:13:48,530
You triggered something
in us, Professor.

1179
01:13:48,572 --> 01:13:51,137
There's no going back.

1180
01:13:51,179 --> 01:13:53,014
I can't live like them.

1181
01:13:56,019 --> 01:13:57,084
Look, Ares.

1182
01:13:58,351 --> 01:13:59,882
I want my badge.

1183
01:13:59,924 --> 01:14:02,148
There's nothing more to say.

1184
01:14:02,190 --> 01:14:05,624
Why don't you take
the guns off of them?

1185
01:14:05,666 --> 01:14:07,285
Because if you think
about it logically,

1186
01:14:07,327 --> 01:14:09,122
they're really in
the same boat as you.

1187
01:14:09,164 --> 01:14:11,091
I still need them.

1188
01:14:11,133 --> 01:14:12,928
You think I'm stupid?

1189
01:14:12,970 --> 01:14:14,523
I can't just steal my own badge.

1190
01:14:14,565 --> 01:14:15,865
Then what?

1191
01:14:15,907 --> 01:14:17,427
Live the rest of
my life in hiding

1192
01:14:17,469 --> 01:14:20,705
knowing the whole
world is after me?

1193
01:14:20,747 --> 01:14:25,072
It's no secret how you feel
about Vista, Professor.

1194
01:14:25,114 --> 01:14:27,778
She's the most hated person
in the world 'cause of you.

1195
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:29,076
If you hadn't seen
it for yourself

1196
01:14:29,118 --> 01:14:30,176
you would have never believed

1197
01:14:30,218 --> 01:14:31,848
she wasn't the one to blame.

1198
01:14:31,890 --> 01:14:34,411
And Ansel, this guy
wants his powers back

1199
01:14:34,453 --> 01:14:36,149
more than anyone.

1200
01:14:36,191 --> 01:14:37,762
His life's pathetic.

1201
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:46,903
A gift
of an old fool.

1202
01:14:52,405 --> 01:14:53,272
Look, Ares.

1203
01:14:54,715 --> 01:14:55,674
The badge.

1204
01:14:57,311 --> 01:14:58,783
It's beyond repair.

1205
01:15:01,249 --> 01:15:02,439
Let me see it.

1206
01:15:02,481 --> 01:15:06,087
I'm not sure you
want to, but all right.

1207
01:15:19,201 --> 01:15:20,497
That's all of it.

1208
01:15:22,501 --> 01:15:24,501
Why would you do that?

1209
01:15:26,472 --> 01:15:28,267
Make me another one.

1210
01:15:28,309 --> 01:15:30,137
No.

1211
01:15:30,179 --> 01:15:31,875
I'm afraid that's quite
out of the question.

1212
01:15:31,917 --> 01:15:34,713
You'll make me another one!

1213
01:15:34,755 --> 01:15:37,657
Or I'll kill everyone
in this room!

1214
01:15:38,825 --> 01:15:42,123
You're not going
to kill anyone, Ares.

1215
01:16:30,536 --> 01:16:32,338
When did you get it?

1216
01:16:51,326 --> 01:16:52,490
Wait.

1217
01:16:56,397 --> 01:16:57,554
Okay.

1218
01:16:57,596 --> 01:16:59,193
I think I get it.

1219
01:16:59,235 --> 01:17:00,392
Ooh.

1220
01:17:00,434 --> 01:17:02,460
Shots fired, shots fired!

1221
01:17:02,502 --> 01:17:04,330
Squad A, come with me.

1222
01:17:04,372 --> 01:17:06,035
Squad B, maintain the perimeter,

1223
01:17:06,077 --> 01:17:07,399
keep those people back!

1224
01:17:08,376 --> 01:17:10,138
Goddammit, Garrett, come on.

1225
01:17:10,180 --> 01:17:11,843
Give me my gun, give me my gun!

1226
01:17:11,885 --> 01:17:13,438
I don't wanna miss the show.

1227
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:14,754
All right.

1228
01:17:23,391 --> 01:17:24,423
Ugh.

1229
01:17:49,780 --> 01:17:50,790
Stop, Vista.

1230
01:17:51,683 --> 01:17:53,287
Wait, just wait.

1231
01:17:55,489 --> 01:17:58,087
I would never hurt her.

1232
01:17:58,129 --> 01:17:59,326
You know that.

1233
01:18:00,428 --> 01:18:03,462
I had no choice,
I needed it back.

1234
01:18:05,466 --> 01:18:07,063
Vista, it's him you're angry at.

1235
01:18:07,105 --> 01:18:08,599
It's the Professor!

1236
01:18:11,109 --> 01:18:12,108
He did this.

1237
01:18:24,958 --> 01:18:26,951
Ruby, darling.

1238
01:18:26,993 --> 01:18:29,928
Go in that stall
and lock the door.

1239
01:18:32,625 --> 01:18:34,255
That's it.

1240
01:18:34,297 --> 01:18:37,896
Now, block your ears
and sing our song.

1241
01:18:37,938 --> 01:18:39,696
I'll be right there.

1242
01:21:25,171 --> 01:21:26,130
Ansel!

1243
01:21:26,172 --> 01:21:27,237
Hey!

1244
01:21:29,274 --> 01:21:31,340
Oh, it's good to see you.

1245
01:21:35,841 --> 01:21:36,602
Wait.

1246
01:21:36,644 --> 01:21:37,669
Where's the Professor?

1247
01:21:37,711 --> 01:21:38,670
Professor?

1248
01:21:38,712 --> 01:21:40,705
- Professor?
- Professor?

1249
01:21:40,747 --> 01:21:41,944
Professor!

1250
01:21:42,815 --> 01:21:44,005
Professor!

1251
01:21:44,047 --> 01:21:45,006
Maya!

1252
01:21:45,048 --> 01:21:45,809
Ansel!

1253
01:21:45,851 --> 01:21:47,547
Medic, I need your help.

1254
01:21:47,589 --> 01:21:49,648
Get someone
over here, right away.

1255
01:21:49,690 --> 01:21:51,518
No, no, no, no, no!

1256
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:52,658
No, Dad, Dad.

1257
01:21:53,661 --> 01:21:55,621
I need you
to look over here.

1258
01:21:55,663 --> 01:21:56,794
Stay with me.

1259
01:22:27,761 --> 01:22:29,226
But paramedics
were reportedly seen

1260
01:22:29,268 --> 01:22:31,360
rushing Professor
Ruckus Mandulbaum,

1261
01:22:31,402 --> 01:22:33,494
the world famous leader
of the Hyperions,

1262
01:22:33,536 --> 01:22:35,991
believed to George Washington
University Hospital

1263
01:22:36,033 --> 01:22:38,202
where he remained overnight.

1264
01:22:38,244 --> 01:22:39,962
He is now back at
home in Hyperion Hall,

1265
01:22:40,004 --> 01:22:42,866
recovering where thousands
of fans and supporters

1266
01:22:42,908 --> 01:22:45,000
have gathered to share
their messages of love.

1267
01:22:45,042 --> 01:22:46,382
Sorry, Ansel.

1268
01:22:50,157 --> 01:22:51,387
I have so,

1269
01:22:53,886 --> 01:22:55,589
so many blueprints.

1270
01:22:57,230 --> 01:22:58,981
It's okay.

1271
01:22:59,023 --> 01:23:01,595
No, its not okay.

1272
01:23:02,862 --> 01:23:04,558
Hey, Ruby Red.

1273
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:05,757
Let's give your mom some time

1274
01:23:05,799 --> 01:23:08,364
to talk to granddad, okay?

1275
01:23:08,406 --> 01:23:09,801
All right, come on.

1276
01:23:13,213 --> 01:23:14,311
Bye.

1277
01:23:29,053 --> 01:23:30,195
Hey.

1278
01:23:34,894 --> 01:23:36,927
I don't know what to say.

1279
01:25:12,497 --> 01:25:14,057
I love you too, Dad.

1280
01:25:50,260 --> 01:25:52,297
Just like
your parents at home,

1281
01:25:52,339 --> 01:25:55,597
I sometimes need to help
my children fall asleep.

1282
01:25:55,639 --> 01:25:57,797
When counting sheep
doesn't cut the mustard

1283
01:25:57,839 --> 01:26:01,005
for my girl Vista, I
sing her this song.

1284
01:27:02,574 --> 01:27:04,996
Now arriving
at 7th Street Station.

1285
01:27:05,038 --> 01:27:07,097
This is the last
station on the red line.

1286
01:27:07,139 --> 01:27:11,042
Please mind your step
upon exiting the train.
