00:06:52,194 --> 00:06:53,935
the search for objectivity
about sharks

00:07:05,642 --> 00:07:08,036
But "Jaws" stopped people
from getting in boats,

178
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,994
going in the water,
going in their pool,

179
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:11,169
going in the bathtub.

180
00:07:11,213 --> 00:07:12,475
People who lived in Iowa
didn't want

181
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,955
to get in the lake
near their house.

182
00:07:13,998 --> 00:07:15,957
It was just like
this phenomenon.

183
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,264
- And it became the movies
that changed the movies.

184
00:07:19,308 --> 00:07:21,789
- We had been making
low-budget

185
00:07:21,832 --> 00:07:23,486
science-fiction pictures,

186
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:26,881
very often
underwater pictures.

187
00:07:26,924 --> 00:07:28,839
And when "Jaws" came out,

188
00:07:28,883 --> 00:07:30,885
"The New York Times" wrote,

189
00:07:30,928 --> 00:07:32,364
"What is 'Jaws'

190
00:07:32,408 --> 00:07:35,237
but a big-budget
Roger Corman film?"

191
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,414
He was right
in half of what he said.

192
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,765
It was a big-budget
Roger Corman film.

193
00:07:41,809 --> 00:07:44,115
But it was also better.

194
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:46,466
It was bigger and better.

195
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:50,339
And I thought--and I talked
to a few of my friends--

196
00:07:50,382 --> 00:07:55,866
the major studios have caught
on to what we've been doing,

197
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,999
and we are in trouble.

198
00:07:58,042 --> 00:07:59,957
But I was not the only one.

199
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:02,699
There was a whole genre
of these

200
00:08:02,743 --> 00:08:04,571
underwater monster films.

201
00:08:04,614 --> 00:08:07,661
But they were all
low-budget films.

202
00:08:11,403 --> 00:08:13,144
- Many of the adventure movies

203
00:08:13,188 --> 00:08:16,234
of the 1920s and the 1930s

204
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:17,627
took place at sea.

205
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:21,936
A good example is
"The Sea Bat" from 1930,

206
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:25,896
in which a giant manta ray
attacks sponge fishers

207
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,768
near the West Indies.

208
00:08:27,811 --> 00:08:32,120
But for some reason, sharks
were considered less dangerous.

209
00:08:32,163 --> 00:08:33,643
- Back in the days,

210
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:36,211
way, way back
from the start of humanity,

211
00:08:36,254 --> 00:08:40,084
people thought of sharks like
a "mysterical" creature,

212
00:08:40,128 --> 00:08:42,173
especially on
the small island

213
00:08:42,217 --> 00:08:44,349
and the Pacific Ocean.

214
00:08:44,393 --> 00:08:46,830
- Anyone who lived
in a coastal area

215
00:08:46,874 --> 00:08:49,920
who saw these creatures
in real life,

216
00:08:49,964 --> 00:08:51,792
we'd tell stories
about those things.

217
00:08:51,835 --> 00:08:54,316
So in mythology and folklore
in different places

218
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:57,101
in the Caribbean,
in the Pacific,

219
00:08:57,145 --> 00:09:00,322
and in Africa have stories
of sharks.

220
00:09:00,365 --> 00:09:03,717
And oftentimes,
these sharks are neither

221
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,066
malevolent or benevolent.

222
00:09:05,109 --> 00:09:06,633
They're somewhere in between.

223
00:09:06,676 --> 00:09:09,592
There are cases
where sharks actually

224
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:11,333
are seen as ancestral spirits

225
00:09:11,376 --> 00:09:13,291
that might actually be helpful.

226
00:09:13,335 --> 00:09:16,599
And there are some folklore
stories where the sharks

227
00:09:16,643 --> 00:09:19,167
themselves actually
help people in the ocean

228
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,082
rather than attack them.

229
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,214
- In Greece, they actually
worshipped sharks

230
00:09:23,258 --> 00:09:24,738
and made it a shark god.

231
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:29,394
But then, most of the shark
god wasn't an evil god.

232
00:09:29,438 --> 00:09:30,787
They didn't punish people.

233
00:09:30,831 --> 00:09:32,746
Very, very first shark movie,

234
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:34,704
"Tabu" from 1931,

235
00:09:34,748 --> 00:09:35,966
the shark was godlike.

236
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,272
It was a shark

237
00:09:37,315 --> 00:09:39,448
who protected an area
in the water.

238
00:09:39,491 --> 00:09:42,233
They actually made
the first rubber shark.

239
00:09:42,277 --> 00:09:46,847
But also, movies like
"She Gods of the Shark Reef"

240
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,066
or "Omoo-Omoo, The Shark God"

241
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:52,069
actually portrayed the shark
as a god.

242
00:09:52,113 --> 00:09:54,855
- And their belief in
the power of the shark god.

243
00:09:54,898 --> 00:09:57,945
- You would see
a statue of a shark.

244
00:09:57,988 --> 00:09:59,686
You would see movies
like "Tiger Shark"

245
00:09:59,729 --> 00:10:02,297
where you'd see the everyday
life of the fishermen.

246
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,952
You'd see how hard it was
and how the shark was

247
00:10:04,995 --> 00:10:06,693
a big part of their lives--

248
00:10:06,736 --> 00:10:08,303
but not as a villain,

249
00:10:08,346 --> 00:10:10,784
but as an animal
they had to deal with.

250
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:12,916
And they actually respected
the animal.

251
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,789
- Now, these are all movies
with sharks in them,

252
00:10:15,832 --> 00:10:19,314
but they're not
"movies about sharks."

253
00:10:19,357 --> 00:10:23,405
- It was mainly just some
individual scenes with sharks.

254
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:24,754
- Cause you're looking at me
like I'm--

255
00:10:24,798 --> 00:10:27,017
- There are even more
specific examples today,

256
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:28,062
or in the modern period.

257
00:10:28,105 --> 00:10:29,063
- Shark head.

258
00:10:29,106 --> 00:10:30,325
This mission is cursed.

259
00:10:30,368 --> 00:10:32,283
- It's not cursed.

260
00:10:32,327 --> 00:10:33,328
- Shark head.

261
00:10:33,371 --> 00:10:35,112
- With DC and Suicide Squad,

262
00:10:35,156 --> 00:10:37,767
this idea of the half-human,
half-shark

263
00:10:37,811 --> 00:10:39,377
is becoming more popular.

264
00:10:39,421 --> 00:10:41,336
But it really has roots
in a mythology

265
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:43,599
that is still very important
to people.

266
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,819
There's this really,
I think, profound

267
00:10:45,862 --> 00:10:48,865
and deeply saddening scene
for a CGI character

268
00:10:48,909 --> 00:10:50,998
where he's standing
in an aquarium

269
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:54,088
forlornly looking at these
other ocean creatures.

270
00:10:54,131 --> 00:10:57,178
And initially you're thinking,
of course, obvious metaphor,

271
00:10:57,221 --> 00:10:59,833
right, that he doesn't feel
like part of the human world.

272
00:10:59,876 --> 00:11:01,704
He misses part
of the ocean world.

273
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:03,706
And then the tank breaks,

274
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,577
and some of those
sea creatures

275
00:11:05,621 --> 00:11:07,449
start attacking him.

276
00:11:07,492 --> 00:11:10,757
It becomes this really quick,
but really interesting

277
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,022
metaphor about not fitting in
in either world.

278
00:11:15,065 --> 00:11:16,588
- A king shark.

279
00:11:16,632 --> 00:11:17,720
- Bullshit.

280
00:11:17,764 --> 00:11:19,853
- What the fuck?

281
00:11:19,896 --> 00:11:22,420
- Some people claim that
Nanaue is a descendant

282
00:11:22,464 --> 00:11:24,161
of an ancient shark god.

283
00:11:24,205 --> 00:11:26,337
Whatever the case,
he's strong and deadly.

284
00:11:26,381 --> 00:11:29,384
- An interesting example
of sharks in mythology

285
00:11:29,427 --> 00:11:31,168
is the story of Nanaue,

286
00:11:31,212 --> 00:11:32,909
which comes from
the Hawaiian Islands.

287
00:11:32,953 --> 00:11:34,606
So there there's a king
of the sharks.

288
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:38,698
And the king is a shark
who can shapeshift and sees

289
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:43,093
a beautiful woman and decides
to shapeshift into a human man

290
00:11:43,137 --> 00:11:44,399
to sort of pursue her.

291
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:45,835
They have an affair.

292
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:50,057
And they have a child,
a boy who is a demigod.

293
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,886
And he's born with the mouth
of a shark on his back.

294
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:56,803
And Nanaue is eventually
killed because of the threat

295
00:11:56,846 --> 00:11:58,718
that he poses
to the other people.

296
00:11:58,761 --> 00:12:01,111
But Nanaue is a very
important figure

297
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:03,897
in Hawaiian indigenous lore

298
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,769
because of this association
with the king of sharks.

299
00:12:06,813 --> 00:12:08,771
And that seems like a really
interesting story to me.

300
00:12:08,815 --> 00:12:11,948
I think it's fascinating
that when Europeans and even

301
00:12:11,992 --> 00:12:14,777
cinematographers
in the 20th and 21st century

302
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:16,823
started thinking
of shark monsters,

303
00:12:16,866 --> 00:12:18,781
instead of going
into the folklore,

304
00:12:18,825 --> 00:12:20,740
we looked at the real shark
again.

305
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:23,699
And James Bond did contribute

306
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,006
to this idea of sharks
as monstrous

307
00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:27,964
by associating them
with the villains

308
00:12:28,008 --> 00:12:30,053
of James Bond films.

309
00:12:30,097 --> 00:12:31,968
- Gently, my friend. Gently.

310
00:12:32,012 --> 00:12:36,233
- I got interested in shark
movies when I was a young kid.

311
00:12:36,277 --> 00:12:39,802
It was actually "Jaws,"
but not "Jaws," the movie.

312
00:12:39,846 --> 00:12:42,849
It was Jaws, the character
from "The Spy Who Loved Me."

313
00:12:42,892 --> 00:12:45,068
You know, the big guy
with the steel teeth.

314
00:12:45,112 --> 00:12:49,812
- And Jaws would kill people
not with his gigantic body

315
00:12:49,856 --> 00:12:51,814
and hands or a gun or a knife.

316
00:12:51,858 --> 00:12:54,643
He would go up to you
and bite you on the neck.

317
00:12:54,686 --> 00:12:57,820
And then he bites the shark
at the end.

318
00:12:57,864 --> 00:12:59,866
- In stuff like
"Live and Let Die"

319
00:12:59,909 --> 00:13:01,215
and "Thunderball,"

320
00:13:01,258 --> 00:13:03,826
we have James encountering,
you know,

321
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,611
a shark in the ocean
that goes directly after him,

322
00:13:06,655 --> 00:13:09,049
and you know,
he has to fight it off.

323
00:13:09,092 --> 00:13:12,008
But more commonly, and I think
more interestingly,

324
00:13:12,052 --> 00:13:15,098
is sharks being used
as a form of execution,

325
00:13:15,142 --> 00:13:16,491
which to my knowledge
is something

326
00:13:16,534 --> 00:13:18,275
that never really occurred.

327
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:20,190
But you have
these pits of sharks

328
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:22,802
and you have these villains
who are cruelly

329
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:25,500
throwing people into
these shark pits.

330
00:13:25,543 --> 00:13:27,458
And they're
instantly devoured.

331
00:13:27,502 --> 00:13:30,505
And there's plumes of blood
everywhere.

332
00:13:30,548 --> 00:13:33,856
- The villain in "Thunderball"
kept sharks in a pool

333
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,466
on his island compound...

334
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,685
- With sharks, no less.

335
00:13:36,728 --> 00:13:39,296
- Both as a way
to dispose of enemies

336
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,472
and as a security measure
and just

337
00:13:41,516 --> 00:13:43,605
a signifier of being evil.

338
00:13:43,648 --> 00:13:46,434
In the first
"Despicable Me" movie,

339
00:13:46,477 --> 00:13:49,089
they had sharks in a pool too,
sort of as an homage to that.

340
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:51,961
- Quiet down, fish.

341
00:13:52,005 --> 00:13:53,571
- And you know,
in "Austin Powers,"

342
00:13:53,615 --> 00:13:55,617
Dr. Evil wants sharks that have

343
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,619
frickin' laser beams
on their heads.

344
00:13:57,662 --> 00:14:00,622
- Sharks with laser beams
attached to their heads.

345
00:14:00,665 --> 00:14:03,103
- The villain has sharks
in "The Phantom."

346
00:14:03,146 --> 00:14:05,583
- "Batman,"
the movie from the '60s,

347
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:08,891
there's a very famous scene
where we see Batman

348
00:14:08,935 --> 00:14:10,110
struggling with a shark.

349
00:14:10,153 --> 00:14:11,981
He's hanging
beneath a helicopter,

350
00:14:12,025 --> 00:14:13,809
and a shark attacks him.

351
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,768
It's very obviously
a rubber shark.

352
00:14:16,812 --> 00:14:18,901
And the only reason
it's moving

353
00:14:18,945 --> 00:14:21,556
is because Batman
is moving his leg.

354
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:22,774
And he's reaching up
to the helicopter.

355
00:14:22,818 --> 00:14:24,254
And Robin's sitting there

356
00:14:24,298 --> 00:14:27,605
and he's asking for this
shark repellent bat spray.

357
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:29,216
And he starts spraying
the shark

358
00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:31,479
and then it's releasing
its rubber teeth.

359
00:14:31,522 --> 00:14:32,915
And it's dropping down.

360
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,483
That's an awesome scene.

361
00:14:35,526 --> 00:14:39,704
- An exploding shark
was pulling my leg.

362
00:14:39,748 --> 00:14:40,923
- The Joker!

363
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:44,579
- It all adds up
to a sinister riddle.

364
00:14:44,622 --> 00:14:46,537
Riddle-er.

365
00:14:46,581 --> 00:14:48,061
Riddler?

366
00:14:48,104 --> 00:14:50,063
- Oh, a thought strikes me.

367
00:14:51,412 --> 00:14:54,850
- So sharks become associated
with being kept as pets

368
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:58,288
by being controlled by humans,
and more specifically

369
00:14:58,332 --> 00:15:00,073
being controlled by villains.

370
00:15:00,116 --> 00:15:02,684
So it's really doubling down
on this idea

371
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:05,078
that sharks themselves
are inherently bad

372
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:08,559
or evil because they're being
used in an evil way

373
00:15:08,603 --> 00:15:10,866
by humans, which,
of course, begs the question

374
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,261
of who are the real monsters
in that situation?

375
00:15:14,304 --> 00:15:18,395
- Pre-"Jaws," there was no
sharksploitation genre.

376
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:20,832
But there was
a treasure-hunting genre.

377
00:15:20,876 --> 00:15:22,573
And a lot of them involved
a shark,

378
00:15:22,617 --> 00:15:25,141
because the treasure was in
a sunken ship or some sort

379
00:15:25,185 --> 00:15:28,492
of underwater area
that they needed to somehow

380
00:15:28,536 --> 00:15:31,887
get down to retrieve
the treasure.

381
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,194
- If you take one
of the more interesting

382
00:15:34,237 --> 00:15:35,978
treasure hunt movies,
shark movies,

383
00:15:36,022 --> 00:15:37,414
it was a movie called "Shark!"

384
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:40,243
with a big name actor,
Burt Reynolds.

385
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,985
But the most interesting story
about that movie

386
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:46,119
was actually the unfortunate
death of one of the stuntmen,

387
00:15:46,162 --> 00:15:48,077
because when they made
the movie,

388
00:15:48,121 --> 00:15:49,861
they made it with real sharks.

389
00:15:49,905 --> 00:15:52,212
And unfortunately,
one of the stuntmen

390
00:15:52,255 --> 00:15:53,996
got too close
to one of the sharks,

391
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,260
and he actually died.

392
00:15:57,304 --> 00:16:00,307
- They had been shooting in
an area that was netted off,

393
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:04,093
but the shark broke through
the netting right into the shot

394
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:06,748
and killed the stuntman
right on camera.

395
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,532
So that was bad enough.

396
00:16:08,576 --> 00:16:12,710
But the producers actually
included the footage

397
00:16:12,754 --> 00:16:17,280
of Jose's death in the film.

398
00:16:17,324 --> 00:16:21,545
They immediately started
publicizing that a stuntman

399
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:26,594
was killed during the making of
this film to garner publicity.

400
00:16:26,637 --> 00:16:29,118
They sold the story
to "Life Magazine."

401
00:16:29,162 --> 00:16:31,773
They eventually changed
the name of the movie

402
00:16:31,816 --> 00:16:34,210
from "Caine" to "Shark!"

403
00:16:34,254 --> 00:16:38,301
Then when "Jaws" came out,
they re-released the movie

404
00:16:38,345 --> 00:16:40,782
to capitalize on it again

405
00:16:40,825 --> 00:16:42,784
and changed the title of it
to "Man-Eater."

406
00:16:42,827 --> 00:16:46,831
And so that is the dark side
of the term exploitation.

407
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,053
- When you think about a movie
like "Blue Water White Death,"

408
00:16:51,097 --> 00:16:54,448
you can really villainize
a lot of what they did.

409
00:16:54,491 --> 00:16:56,493
But at the same time,
I think of it more like

410
00:16:56,537 --> 00:16:58,104
they were us, but at that time.

411
00:16:58,147 --> 00:17:00,497
And there was a lot
of real thought

412
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:04,153
that these were very, very
dangerous, villainous animals.

413
00:17:04,197 --> 00:17:07,765
- We're looking for the animal
that I think is considered

414
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:10,986
to be the most
dangerous predator

415
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,466
still living in the world,

416
00:17:12,509 --> 00:17:16,296
the great white shark,
which attacks the...

417
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:18,167
- "Blue Water, White Death,"
you know,

418
00:17:18,211 --> 00:17:20,517
I missed that
when it first came out.

419
00:17:20,561 --> 00:17:23,738
But it became a--almost like

420
00:17:23,781 --> 00:17:25,653
the Dead Sea Scroll
or something.

421
00:17:25,696 --> 00:17:28,482
Those of us that knew the ocean
and knew sharks,

422
00:17:28,525 --> 00:17:30,397
when we saw it, we went, wow.

423
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,963
That's really good.

424
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:34,444
- Before this film,
there's only been one shot

425
00:17:34,488 --> 00:17:36,098
of a great white underwater.

426
00:17:36,142 --> 00:17:37,752
And that Ron Taylor had taken.

427
00:17:37,795 --> 00:17:39,536
And that was all there was.

428
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:44,759
I was 24 years old
and I was just totally enamored

429
00:17:44,802 --> 00:17:46,978
of the idea of doing this.

430
00:17:47,022 --> 00:17:51,374
And then I met Peter Gimbel,
Stan Waterman.

431
00:17:51,418 --> 00:17:53,028
Jim Lipscomb I knew well.

432
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,899
He was a great friend of ours.

433
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:57,772
And then
Ron and Valerie Taylor.

434
00:17:57,815 --> 00:18:01,123
And these guys had
great delight in what

435
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:05,345
they were doing and yet
were afraid in the sense

436
00:18:05,388 --> 00:18:06,650
it was unknown.

437
00:18:06,694 --> 00:18:09,436
Didn't know
what was gonna happen.

438
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:11,742
Peter Gimbel invented
the cages.

439
00:18:11,786 --> 00:18:14,441
And that allowed them
to film underwater.

440
00:18:14,484 --> 00:18:17,183
And that was radical
at that time.

441
00:18:17,226 --> 00:18:20,708
And then they filmed
at night underwater,

442
00:18:20,751 --> 00:18:23,711
which was the scariest thing
in the world.

443
00:18:23,754 --> 00:18:27,149
It was a real, real danger
there, you know.

444
00:18:27,193 --> 00:18:29,543
And when they decided
to swim with the sharks,

445
00:18:29,586 --> 00:18:31,022
one of the things
they decided was

446
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:32,676
they'd have these bang sticks.

447
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,157
And so one person was filming,

448
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:37,333
and then the other person
would be behind

449
00:18:37,377 --> 00:18:39,030
just looking for sharks
and trying to--

450
00:18:39,074 --> 00:18:40,771
but when you have goggles
like this,

451
00:18:40,815 --> 00:18:42,077
you've got no
peripheral vision.

452
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,687
What's happening back there?

453
00:18:43,731 --> 00:18:44,775
What's happening over there?

454
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:46,212
And the sharks would come up.

455
00:18:46,255 --> 00:18:47,691
And what they would do
a lot of times

456
00:18:47,735 --> 00:18:49,519
is the ocean tip, white tips,
would come up

457
00:18:49,563 --> 00:18:51,913
and bang it like this,
you know,

458
00:18:51,956 --> 00:18:55,090
luckily, instead of biting,
you know.

459
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,484
- In the filming
of "Blue Water, White Death,"

460
00:18:57,527 --> 00:19:00,051
the filmmakers themselves kill
a shark in it

461
00:19:00,095 --> 00:19:01,444
because they get scared of it

462
00:19:01,488 --> 00:19:03,185
and they have their boom stick,
and they use it.

463
00:19:03,229 --> 00:19:06,406
And so I mention the movie

464
00:19:06,449 --> 00:19:08,625
not to make light of some
of those darker parts,

465
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:10,584
but just to show people
all of these things

466
00:19:10,627 --> 00:19:12,151
are like dominoes.

467
00:19:15,632 --> 00:19:17,547
- The 18th century,
we start to see

468
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:20,637
more negative illustrations
and paintings

469
00:19:20,681 --> 00:19:23,205
of sharks attacking people.

470
00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:25,425
At first, this is
usually sharks following

471
00:19:25,468 --> 00:19:28,515
alongside slave ships.

472
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:32,214
And then in the 19th century,
when we see an increase

473
00:19:32,258 --> 00:19:35,913
in print culture, we start
seeing more shark attack

474
00:19:35,957 --> 00:19:37,959
encounters being
reported as well,

475
00:19:38,002 --> 00:19:42,616
one of which was a cabin boy
fell off the side of a ship

476
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:46,446
in Cuba and his leg
was bitten off by a shark,

477
00:19:46,489 --> 00:19:49,318
which, of course,
newspapers latched on to.

478
00:19:49,362 --> 00:19:51,668
And that inspired
an American painter

479
00:19:51,712 --> 00:19:54,584
to make a very famous painting
called "Watson and the Shark"

480
00:19:54,628 --> 00:19:56,804
that depicts an exaggerated
account of that.

481
00:19:56,847 --> 00:19:58,806
And "Watson and the Shark,"
I do think,

482
00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:00,547
started some of these
negative depictions

483
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:03,767
that have continued
throughout history.

484
00:20:03,811 --> 00:20:05,813
- In the real world,
there was two

485
00:20:05,856 --> 00:20:08,381
major events
which actually transformed

486
00:20:08,424 --> 00:20:09,947
the public's view of sharks.

487
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:13,255
You had an event in 1916
in New Jersey

488
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:16,476
where actually some
bull sharks swam up a river

489
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:20,610
and attacked a few who I guess
was in the water swimming.

490
00:20:20,654 --> 00:20:23,004
And at that time in 1916,

491
00:20:23,047 --> 00:20:25,006
you didn't have
very much television.

492
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:27,922
You have some radio and you
have some of the newspapers,

493
00:20:27,965 --> 00:20:30,359
so that story
about the shark attack

494
00:20:30,403 --> 00:20:33,841
traveled slowly but steadily
through all of America.

495
00:20:33,884 --> 00:20:36,104
And people was totally afraid
of sharks.

496
00:20:36,147 --> 00:20:39,673
You can see that the tourists
was running away

497
00:20:39,716 --> 00:20:41,501
from the beaches
because of when they saw

498
00:20:41,544 --> 00:20:42,980
the stories in the newspapers.

499
00:20:43,024 --> 00:20:46,636
- So we start seeing
front page newspapers

500
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:50,074
with photos of sharks
and, like, "man-eater."

501
00:20:50,118 --> 00:20:52,033
So we have man-eater
associated with the shark

502
00:20:52,076 --> 00:20:53,469
for the first time.

503
00:20:53,513 --> 00:20:54,992
That's on one side
of the world.

504
00:20:55,036 --> 00:20:56,298
On the other side of the globe,

505
00:20:56,342 --> 00:20:58,648
Australia was getting
more into surfing.

506
00:20:58,692 --> 00:21:01,564
So of course, people
were also being attacked

507
00:21:01,608 --> 00:21:03,218
or bitten by sharks
in Australia.

508
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,090
So as that circulated
through the globe,

509
00:21:06,134 --> 00:21:09,311
this idea of the man-eater
plus real shark attacks,

510
00:21:09,355 --> 00:21:11,574
the demonization
and the creation

511
00:21:11,618 --> 00:21:13,620
of the monster shark
really started becoming

512
00:21:13,663 --> 00:21:14,925
more and more prevalent.

513
00:21:14,969 --> 00:21:17,580
- And then throughout
the Second World War,

514
00:21:17,624 --> 00:21:21,018
you had the warship,
the USS "Indianapolis."

515
00:21:21,062 --> 00:21:23,934
The ship was carrying some
part of the atomic bomb

516
00:21:23,978 --> 00:21:26,720
that went down on Japan
in the ending

517
00:21:26,763 --> 00:21:28,330
of the Second World War.

518
00:21:28,374 --> 00:21:33,030
And on the way back,
a Japanese submarine

519
00:21:33,074 --> 00:21:36,904
sank the big warship.

520
00:21:36,947 --> 00:21:40,690
- Here you have Captain McVay
bringing the secret cargo.

521
00:21:40,734 --> 00:21:44,651
Intercepted by a Japanese sub,
sunk.

522
00:21:44,694 --> 00:21:51,353
So 1,200 men go into the water
and 300 and something survive.

523
00:21:51,397 --> 00:21:53,573
And many of them--
most of them, in fact--

524
00:21:53,616 --> 00:21:56,880
die from shark attacks.

525
00:21:56,924 --> 00:21:58,926
- Woody James was one
of the survivors

526
00:21:58,969 --> 00:22:00,580
of the "Indianapolis."

527
00:22:00,623 --> 00:22:02,146
And I got to ask him.

528
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,801
I said, how did you feel
the first time you saw "Jaws"?

529
00:22:04,845 --> 00:22:06,847
Because that was
the first time anybody

530
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,588
had ever heard about that.

531
00:22:08,631 --> 00:22:09,937
And he one of the survivors.

532
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,199
And he said
he was just stunned,

533
00:22:11,242 --> 00:22:12,766
because these guys--
this was a generation

534
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:14,202
that didn't talk about
these things.

535
00:22:14,245 --> 00:22:16,030
No one, none of their families,
none of the kids,

536
00:22:16,073 --> 00:22:17,597
no one really knew
what they went through.

537
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,905
They just kept quiet
and buried that trauma.

538
00:22:26,997 --> 00:22:31,915
- Peter had many ideas
for novels.

539
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:33,439
But the one he liked the best

540
00:22:33,482 --> 00:22:37,530
came from reading
about an article

541
00:22:37,573 --> 00:22:39,662
about a giant
great white shark.

542
00:22:39,706 --> 00:22:43,405
- In 1964, long before all
of this drama had happened,

543
00:22:43,449 --> 00:22:45,886
I read a story
in the "New York Daily News"

544
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:47,540
about a fisherman
who had caught

545
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:51,413
a 4,550-pound great white shark

546
00:22:51,457 --> 00:22:53,546
off the beaches of Long Island.

547
00:22:53,589 --> 00:22:56,592
And I thought, my God,
what would happen

548
00:22:56,636 --> 00:22:59,421
if one of those things came
into a resort community

549
00:22:59,465 --> 00:23:00,466
and wouldn't go away?

550
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:02,293
- Peter wrote "Jaws."

551
00:23:02,337 --> 00:23:06,428
It was fiction based on fact,
I remember he used to say.

552
00:23:06,472 --> 00:23:11,215
So everything in it
could have happened

553
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:15,219
or did happen, except this idea

554
00:23:15,263 --> 00:23:17,961
that the shark had
some idea to do it.

555
00:23:18,005 --> 00:23:21,661
- At that time, when Peter was
doing research for the book,

556
00:23:21,704 --> 00:23:23,445
there was not a lot
of research.

557
00:23:23,489 --> 00:23:26,622
But there was a theory called
the "rogue shark theory."

558
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:30,844
And that was that once
a shark tasted human flesh,

559
00:23:30,887 --> 00:23:33,716
it would then hang around
and wanted more human flesh.

560
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,936
Peter did not believe
in that theory.

561
00:23:35,979 --> 00:23:38,460
- Now, this shark
that swims alone.

562
00:23:38,504 --> 00:23:39,505
- Rogue.
- What's it called?

563
00:23:39,548 --> 00:23:41,898
- Rogue, rogue.
- Yeah.

564
00:23:41,942 --> 00:23:44,814
Now, this guy,
he keeps swimming around

565
00:23:44,858 --> 00:23:46,860
in a place
where the feeding is good

566
00:23:46,903 --> 00:23:48,818
until the food supply is gone,
right?

567
00:23:48,862 --> 00:23:50,472
- It's called territoriality.

568
00:23:50,516 --> 00:23:54,171
It's just a theory
that I happen to agree with.

569
00:23:54,215 --> 00:23:55,825
- The rogue shark theory
is nonsense.

570
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:57,348
The idea that
one shark develops

571
00:23:57,392 --> 00:23:59,612
a taste for human blood
and then becomes evil

572
00:23:59,655 --> 00:24:01,352
and the only way
to save the beach

573
00:24:01,396 --> 00:24:03,267
is to track down that one
specific individual shark

574
00:24:03,311 --> 00:24:05,748
and kill it,
that theory has inspired

575
00:24:05,792 --> 00:24:08,185
a lot of what we call
shark control measures

576
00:24:08,229 --> 00:24:09,926
around the world,
and it doesn't work,

577
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:12,189
because even if you could
identify what specific

578
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:14,844
individual shark was
responsible for a given bite,

579
00:24:14,888 --> 00:24:17,368
which you almost certainly
cannot,

580
00:24:17,412 --> 00:24:18,457
you couldn't find it.

581
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,110
And in the efforts to find it,

582
00:24:20,154 --> 00:24:21,547
you would kill
a bunch of other sharks

583
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:24,593
that you're even saying
were not the ones involved.

584
00:24:24,637 --> 00:24:29,293
- Stephen really went with
the rogue shark theory.

585
00:24:29,337 --> 00:24:33,384
And it sure did make
for a really powerful movie.

586
00:24:33,428 --> 00:24:35,822
- The book's singular gimmick,

587
00:24:35,865 --> 00:24:39,347
which was to give you
the shark's point of view,

588
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,567
that was, you know,
that was a first,

589
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:45,179
to have the monster, you know,
as a character.

590
00:24:45,222 --> 00:24:48,443
- This is the shark
that was built for "Jaws 1."

591
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,532
And it was built by a guy
named Joe Alves.

592
00:24:50,576 --> 00:24:52,752
He was one of Universal's
resident visual effect--

593
00:24:52,795 --> 00:24:53,883
special effects guys.

594
00:24:53,927 --> 00:24:55,058
Because there is a difference.

595
00:24:55,102 --> 00:24:56,625
Special effects are practical,

596
00:24:56,669 --> 00:24:58,322
visual effects are post.

597
00:24:58,366 --> 00:25:00,803
"Jaws," we did not have
visual effects to the scale

598
00:25:00,847 --> 00:25:03,589
where they could have done
this kind of shark things.

599
00:25:03,632 --> 00:25:05,504
Computers didn't exist
for doing CG.

600
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:07,549
So they built this shark.

601
00:25:07,593 --> 00:25:10,683
Joe Alves and his crew
physically built this shark.

602
00:25:10,726 --> 00:25:13,555
And famously,
it did not work very well.

603
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:16,340
So that is the reason "Jaws"
is such a powerful film.

604
00:25:16,384 --> 00:25:18,995
- It's actually those moments
in the movie that really

605
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,650
separate it and make it
as good as it is,

606
00:25:21,694 --> 00:25:23,913
because it's such clever
filmmaking.

607
00:25:23,957 --> 00:25:26,829
- It's probably from where I
grew up in the '70s, watching,

608
00:25:26,873 --> 00:25:30,746
you know, movies
where the limitations

609
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:33,532
from budget and maybe even
mechanical issues

610
00:25:33,575 --> 00:25:34,968
have limited the amount
of times

611
00:25:35,011 --> 00:25:36,360
you actually see the creature.

612
00:25:36,404 --> 00:25:38,798
And to me, that's much scarier.

613
00:25:38,841 --> 00:25:40,321
- Stephen King once said,
once you see

614
00:25:40,364 --> 00:25:42,366
the zipper down
the monster's back,

615
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,672
the game's over.

616
00:25:43,716 --> 00:25:45,587
So the more real you can make
the situation,

617
00:25:45,631 --> 00:25:46,893
I think the more--
the easier it is

618
00:25:46,936 --> 00:25:48,590
for people to get
invested in it.

619
00:25:48,634 --> 00:25:52,463
- Our focus was creating
this creature

620
00:25:52,507 --> 00:25:55,510
as close as we could
to a shark.

621
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:56,772
We weren't thinking about what

622
00:25:56,816 --> 00:25:58,252
he was gonna do to the future.

623
00:25:58,295 --> 00:26:00,776
- Summer wasn't for
blockbusters back then.

624
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,865
It was just for
escapist fare, you know,

625
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:04,998
drive-in movies,
that kind of stuff.

626
00:26:05,041 --> 00:26:07,435
That's the movie
that made $100 million.

627
00:26:07,478 --> 00:26:09,089
And everybody wanted
some of that.

628
00:26:09,132 --> 00:26:11,352
- When the movie came out,
everything went crazy.

629
00:26:11,395 --> 00:26:15,835
Everything totally changed--
not only for the shark movies,

630
00:26:15,878 --> 00:26:17,924
but also for
the cinema history.

631
00:26:17,967 --> 00:26:20,666
- Movies didn't open
in as many theaters

632
00:26:20,709 --> 00:26:22,450
then as they open in now.

633
00:26:22,493 --> 00:26:25,279
So I remember waiting
in line for five hours

634
00:26:25,322 --> 00:26:27,411
the first time we saw "Jaws,"
because we had to wait

635
00:26:27,455 --> 00:26:31,111
for two showings to come
and go before we got in.

636
00:26:31,154 --> 00:26:32,982
- At that time in 1975,

637
00:26:33,026 --> 00:26:34,810
the idea of running
your trailer

638
00:26:34,854 --> 00:26:37,726
as a TV commercial
was relatively new.

639
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,685
And "Jaws" did it a lot.

640
00:26:39,728 --> 00:26:42,426
And that meant that
everybody was seeing it.

641
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,907
It wasn't just
point-of-contact ads

642
00:26:44,951 --> 00:26:48,911
at the movie theater,
it was in your living room.

643
00:26:48,955 --> 00:26:50,391
- I saw those ads
all over the place.

644
00:26:50,434 --> 00:26:52,785
And it really stoked
my enthusiasm for it.

645
00:26:52,828 --> 00:26:55,048
The book was in every
bookstore you went into

646
00:26:55,091 --> 00:26:56,353
and supermarket.

647
00:26:56,397 --> 00:26:57,964
It was inescapable
during that summer.

648
00:26:58,007 --> 00:27:00,662
I think it was "TIME" magazine
had it on the cover.

649
00:27:00,706 --> 00:27:03,186
The cool thing was, even if
you couldn't see the movie,

650
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:05,754
there was tons and tons
of merchandise.

651
00:27:05,798 --> 00:27:07,451
You know, that was one
of the first movies

652
00:27:07,495 --> 00:27:10,150
that got seriously marketed
with lots of tie-in stuff.

653
00:27:10,193 --> 00:27:13,022
So I had the "Jaws" game.

654
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:14,023
- You're out.

655
00:27:14,067 --> 00:27:15,285
"Jaws."

656
00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:17,374
It's you against
the great white shark

657
00:27:17,418 --> 00:27:18,375
and each other.

658
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:19,463
From Ideal.

659
00:27:19,507 --> 00:27:21,552
- Everybody wore
"Jaws" T-shirts.

660
00:27:21,596 --> 00:27:24,468
Everybody had "Jaws" posters
and toys.

661
00:27:24,512 --> 00:27:27,515
There was a parody song
released

662
00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:30,997
on top 40 radio
called "Mr. Jaws."

663
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,260
And I just--
pardon the expression--

664
00:27:33,303 --> 00:27:35,001
ate that stuff up.

665
00:27:35,044 --> 00:27:36,872
To this day, the scene
that still scares me

666
00:27:36,916 --> 00:27:39,701
is when the fisherman's boat
gets capsized

667
00:27:39,745 --> 00:27:41,355
and there's
that overhead shot.

668
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:43,966
And he's hanging on the boat
and you kind of see

669
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:46,186
the shark come up
underneath him and grab him.

670
00:27:46,229 --> 00:27:48,971
- And the scene when you see
the shark for the first time

671
00:27:49,015 --> 00:27:51,060
in "Jaws,"
when he pop out of the water

672
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:54,063
and we see Sheriff Brody
just floating, stalled.

673
00:27:54,107 --> 00:27:56,326
That was one of
the defining moments

674
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:57,501
for shark movies for me.

675
00:27:57,545 --> 00:27:59,416
- Run down and chum
some of this shit.

676
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:03,551
- That's another one
that still gets me

677
00:28:03,594 --> 00:28:04,987
every time I watch it.

678
00:28:05,031 --> 00:28:07,337
It's those classic moments
that just still work,

679
00:28:07,381 --> 00:28:09,339
no matter how many times
you've seen the film.

680
00:28:09,383 --> 00:28:12,691
- I remember seeing "Jaws"
and thinking how cool it was

681
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:15,476
and how phony the shark was.
[laughing]

682
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:17,739
You know,
after seeing the real things,

683
00:28:17,783 --> 00:28:21,700
but how great the cast was
and what a great film it was.

684
00:28:21,743 --> 00:28:23,876
And then I got worried,

685
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,967
as a lot of people
who know sharks went, uh-oh.

686
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:30,143
So if you make this
the great villains,

687
00:28:30,186 --> 00:28:32,232
then A,
they're gonna kill them.

688
00:28:32,275 --> 00:28:34,974
And B, people are gonna be
scared of them, and so--

689
00:28:35,017 --> 00:28:36,366
which is exactly what happened.

690
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:39,892
- We were absolutely thrilled
with the success

691
00:28:39,935 --> 00:28:42,242
of the book and the movie
"Jaws."

692
00:28:42,285 --> 00:28:46,637
But we were just horrified
that people somehow

693
00:28:46,681 --> 00:28:49,423
felt that this was
a license to go out

694
00:28:49,466 --> 00:28:52,643
and kill every shark
they could.

695
00:28:52,687 --> 00:28:54,950
There were more shark
tournaments that were started

696
00:28:54,994 --> 00:28:57,300
to go out and kill sharks.

697
00:28:57,344 --> 00:28:59,563
- Around the time when
the movie "Jaws" came out,

698
00:28:59,607 --> 00:29:01,783
you can see
that shark landings

699
00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:03,959
really, really skyrocketed,

700
00:29:04,003 --> 00:29:05,744
specifically around that time.

701
00:29:05,787 --> 00:29:08,224
So specifically shark landings
around the United States.

702
00:29:08,268 --> 00:29:11,662
And that was because of
this very effective idea

703
00:29:11,706 --> 00:29:16,363
that people had, unfortunately,
that sharks were so dangerous

704
00:29:16,406 --> 00:29:19,409
that it was a safety issue
and that they were

705
00:29:19,453 --> 00:29:21,672
actually helping
by removing large amounts

706
00:29:21,716 --> 00:29:22,891
of sharks at one time.

707
00:29:22,935 --> 00:29:24,588
- Some species still
haven't recovered

708
00:29:24,632 --> 00:29:26,721
from that summer's
exploitation.

709
00:29:30,377 --> 00:29:32,509
- One of the very first
sharksploitation films

710
00:29:32,553 --> 00:29:35,034
that we see out of the gates
right after "Jaws" is

711
00:29:35,077 --> 00:29:36,818
"Mako, Jaws of Death,"

712
00:29:36,862 --> 00:29:39,255
which is
a William Grefé feature.

713
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:42,345
It's an interesting film in
that it does use real sharks.

714
00:29:42,389 --> 00:29:44,957
And the actors
in the film are actually

715
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,263
swimming with real sharks.

716
00:29:47,307 --> 00:29:48,874
- I found out later that,
I think,

717
00:29:48,917 --> 00:29:50,963
some of the sharks had
had their teeth removed,

718
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:52,921
which is kind of dubious.

719
00:29:52,965 --> 00:29:54,836
And I don't know
how I feel about that.

720
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,143
But it is
a very entertaining movie.

721
00:29:57,186 --> 00:29:59,972
I'm also amused by the fact
that it's referred to

722
00:30:00,015 --> 00:30:02,322
sometimes as
"Mako, The Jaws of Death,"

723
00:30:02,365 --> 00:30:04,237
though I've never seen
a print of the movie

724
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,847
or an ad or a poster for it

725
00:30:05,891 --> 00:30:07,588
saying,
"Mako, The Jaws of Death."

726
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:09,111
And the sharks aren't makos.

727
00:30:09,155 --> 00:30:12,027
There are no mako sharks
anywhere in that film.

728
00:30:12,071 --> 00:30:14,073
- Unfortunately, some
of the tales coming out

729
00:30:14,116 --> 00:30:15,901
of "Mako, Jaws of Death"
is that the sharks

730
00:30:15,944 --> 00:30:18,817
were not treated very well
during the filming at all.

731
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,254
Some of them were killed,
actually, for the filming.

732
00:30:21,297 --> 00:30:23,386
But what's unusual about it

733
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:25,475
is one of the very few films

734
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:27,042
that come out post-"Jaws"

735
00:30:27,086 --> 00:30:29,828
that is actually about
showing compassion to sharks.

736
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:31,830
The movie itself
is about this man

737
00:30:31,873 --> 00:30:33,309
who is trying
to preserve sharks

738
00:30:33,353 --> 00:30:35,094
and is telepathically
connected to them.

739
00:30:35,137 --> 00:30:36,443
But at the same time,
you find out

740
00:30:36,486 --> 00:30:37,923
that some of
the filming procedures

741
00:30:37,966 --> 00:30:39,881
they were doing
to get these shots

742
00:30:39,925 --> 00:30:41,796
are really damn horrific.

743
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,146
- Another shark movie
that is not afraid

744
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,453
of killing any real sharks

745
00:30:46,496 --> 00:30:49,717
is "Sharks' Treasure"
from 1975,

746
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,155
in which men go on
an underwater treasure hunt

747
00:30:53,199 --> 00:30:56,419
and they have to kill sharks
in order to stay alive.

748
00:30:56,463 --> 00:30:58,726
- And most of the trailer
is sharks getting killed,

749
00:30:58,769 --> 00:30:59,988
and really getting killed,

750
00:31:00,032 --> 00:31:02,904
like getting hit
with spears and bang sticks.

751
00:31:02,948 --> 00:31:04,601
And even at the time,
I'm like,

752
00:31:04,645 --> 00:31:07,517
they're killing sharks
on camera for this movie.

753
00:31:07,561 --> 00:31:09,084
"Tintorera" was another one

754
00:31:09,128 --> 00:31:10,651
that I caught up with
later on.

755
00:31:10,694 --> 00:31:13,741
That's like combining sharks
and sexploitation.

756
00:31:13,784 --> 00:31:15,612
You know, it's lots
of naked people, you know,

757
00:31:15,656 --> 00:31:16,918
and shark attacks.

758
00:31:16,962 --> 00:31:18,920
And that's a great example

759
00:31:18,964 --> 00:31:21,923
of exploitation at its finest.

760
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:23,794
[woman screaming]

761
00:31:29,017 --> 00:31:31,367
[dramatic music]

762
00:31:31,411 --> 00:31:33,979
- I remember "Shark Kill,"
which is a TV movie.

763
00:31:34,022 --> 00:31:36,720
I think that was the first
kind of "Jaws" knockoff

764
00:31:36,764 --> 00:31:38,070
that made it to market.

765
00:31:38,113 --> 00:31:40,246
- They played it up
like it was "Jaws,"

766
00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:44,467
but it's about these two guys
that go out to hunt a shark.

767
00:31:44,511 --> 00:31:48,123
As a kid, it made me wonder,
is this what "Jaws" was?

768
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:49,951
But it clearly wasn't.

769
00:31:49,995 --> 00:31:52,127
- And I remember
all the other TV spin-offs.

770
00:31:52,171 --> 00:31:54,477
Like Sheriff Lobo encountered
the shark.

771
00:31:54,521 --> 00:31:56,349
Like, all the Universal
TV series

772
00:31:56,392 --> 00:31:58,177
would have their characters

773
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,266
encounter the shark
from "Jaws."

774
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:03,269
- "The Hardy Boys" had
a shark episode.

775
00:32:03,312 --> 00:32:06,446
"The Bionic Woman" had
a shark episode.

776
00:32:06,489 --> 00:32:08,056
There's a show called
"Matt Houston"

777
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,101
that had a shark episode.

778
00:32:09,144 --> 00:32:11,146
Sharks were everywhere.

779
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:13,148
- There was Jabberjaw,
you know,

780
00:32:13,192 --> 00:32:15,150
the Scooby-Doo rip-off
of the talking shark.

781
00:32:15,194 --> 00:32:16,978
There was Misterjaw

782
00:32:17,022 --> 00:32:18,806
that was on
"The Pink Panther."

783
00:32:18,849 --> 00:32:21,287
And then I'll always remember,
they had the episode where

784
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:24,638
the Six Million Dollar Man
fights a killer shark.

785
00:32:24,681 --> 00:32:27,989
- When he's holding
the shark and shaking it,

786
00:32:28,033 --> 00:32:29,425
it's the nurse shark,

787
00:32:29,469 --> 00:32:31,253
which is not
a dangerous shark.

788
00:32:31,297 --> 00:32:34,387
But when they're showing
the shark swimming away,

789
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:36,302
that's a sand tiger.

790
00:32:36,345 --> 00:32:40,001
Now, a sand tiger,
doing that too?

791
00:32:40,045 --> 00:32:43,526
I think you'd be pretty stupid
to grab it

792
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:45,485
and do the same thing
as you do with a nurse shark.

793
00:32:45,528 --> 00:32:47,052
- And then, of course,
you know,

794
00:32:47,095 --> 00:32:51,795
the most infamous example
is the jump the shark episode

795
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:54,189
of "Happy Days."

796
00:32:54,233 --> 00:32:57,236
It has coined the idiom
jumping the shark,

797
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,543
which is a term which means
that something has become

798
00:33:00,587 --> 00:33:03,198
so successful that there's
an inevitable point

799
00:33:03,242 --> 00:33:05,505
where that success
begins to sour.

800
00:33:05,548 --> 00:33:09,291
That moment is the moment
that it jumps the shark.

801
00:33:09,335 --> 00:33:10,814
- There he goes!

802
00:33:10,858 --> 00:33:13,208
- I mean,
Fonzie jumping the shark

803
00:33:13,252 --> 00:33:18,561
was the world going,

804
00:33:18,605 --> 00:33:20,955
"Yeah, it's just infecting
everything."

00:33:58,775 --> 00:34:01,822

And that is "Grizzly."

831
00:34:17,098 --> 00:34:22,625
- Grizzly uses almost the exact
same script of "Jaws."

832
00:34:22,669 --> 00:34:25,280
- It uses a lot of the same
filming style,

833
00:34:25,324 --> 00:34:28,370
where it's POVs of it watching
people from a distance.

834
00:34:28,414 --> 00:34:30,546
It has a very similar tone
to it.

835
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:33,332
And they actually used it
in the marketing campaign

836
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:35,029
as well,
where it was something like,

837
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,813
"Jaws" but on land.

838
00:34:36,857 --> 00:34:40,904
Like, it literally states
that it is taken from "Jaws."

839
00:34:40,948 --> 00:34:42,080
- Another one that was kind of

840
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:43,820
a "Jaws" on land thing
was "The Car."

841
00:34:43,864 --> 00:34:46,171
You know, it's basically
a predator of sorts,

842
00:34:46,214 --> 00:34:48,608
you know, terrorizing a town,
from Universal.

843
00:34:48,651 --> 00:34:50,827
- And this car
just starts riding around,

844
00:34:50,871 --> 00:34:52,220
picking people off.

845
00:34:52,264 --> 00:34:55,832
And somehow the car feels
just like "Jaws."

846
00:34:55,876 --> 00:34:57,399
- In "Jaws,"

847
00:34:57,443 --> 00:34:59,662
"Jaws" kills a kid,
the little Kintner boy.

848
00:34:59,706 --> 00:35:01,882
In "Tentacles,"
they're gonna outdo "Jaws."

849
00:35:01,925 --> 00:35:03,623
They kill a baby
in a baby carriage.

850
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:06,930
The tentacle pulls the baby
underwater, kills the baby.

851
00:35:06,974 --> 00:35:09,585
- Billy!

852
00:35:09,629 --> 00:35:13,023
- Two years after "Jaws"
comes out, we get "Orca."

853
00:35:13,067 --> 00:35:14,895
This is Dino De Laurentiis

854
00:35:14,938 --> 00:35:18,725
making a ridiculously
elegantly well-done

855
00:35:18,768 --> 00:35:20,335
exploitation film.

856
00:35:20,379 --> 00:35:22,642
- "Orca" was another one
that was kind of omnipresent.

857
00:35:22,685 --> 00:35:24,905
The poster, I think,
was on the back

858
00:35:24,948 --> 00:35:26,776
of every single
Marvel comic book

859
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,083
that came out
in the summer of '77.

860
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,824
So it's a big event film,
you know,

861
00:35:30,867 --> 00:35:33,261
even though it's obviously
just ripping off "Jaws."

862
00:35:33,305 --> 00:35:35,176
- So the way
that "Orca" is set up,

863
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,612
it does this interesting thing

864
00:35:36,656 --> 00:35:39,659
where it puts the audience
on the side of the orca

865
00:35:39,702 --> 00:35:40,921
from the very get-go,

866
00:35:40,964 --> 00:35:43,837
because we start
with the killer shark

867
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,230
kind of going
through the water,

868
00:35:45,273 --> 00:35:47,188
and we get the feeling
that that killer shark

869
00:35:47,232 --> 00:35:48,581
is about to eat somebody.

870
00:35:48,624 --> 00:35:50,191
And we think, okay,
it's like "Jaws."

871
00:35:50,235 --> 00:35:51,497
We're gonna be looking
at these killer sharks.

872
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,499
- You think sharks are scary?

873
00:35:53,542 --> 00:35:56,066
What's bigger and faster?

874
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,633
A killer whale.

875
00:35:57,677 --> 00:36:02,290
Orca shoots like a missile
and hits the shark,

876
00:36:02,334 --> 00:36:05,032
and the shark goes, wham,
out of the air.

877
00:36:05,075 --> 00:36:07,861
And Orca just kills the shark
because it wants to.

878
00:36:07,904 --> 00:36:09,210
- Jesus, what did that?

879
00:36:09,254 --> 00:36:10,864
- I think, out of all
the "Jaws" rip-offs,

880
00:36:10,907 --> 00:36:12,431
it is probably
the best crafted.

881
00:36:12,474 --> 00:36:15,999
[suspenseful music]

882
00:36:16,043 --> 00:36:19,089
- Roger Corman really had
an eye for trends.

883
00:36:19,133 --> 00:36:22,745
And he knew, in the '70s,
that it was a good idea

884
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:24,834
to make "Jaws" rip-offs.

885
00:36:24,878 --> 00:36:27,228
- "Piranha" was
a reaction to "Jaws."

886
00:36:27,272 --> 00:36:30,753
We felt, all right,
they've gone up above us.

887
00:36:30,797 --> 00:36:33,800
We've got to raise our level
a little bit.

888
00:36:33,843 --> 00:36:35,149
- How could you not be aware

889
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,324
you were making
a "Jaws" rip-off?

890
00:36:36,368 --> 00:36:37,891
I mean, it's a "Jaws" rip-off.

891
00:36:37,934 --> 00:36:39,675
I mean, obviously nobody
would be making this movie

892
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:41,068
if it wasn't for the fact
that there had been

893
00:36:41,111 --> 00:36:42,809
a big hit movie
that took place

894
00:36:42,852 --> 00:36:44,506
underwater with a monster.

895
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:49,946
And so it was--we were so
alert to the fact that it was

896
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:52,819
a "Jaws" rip-off that the
opening titles of the movie

897
00:36:52,862 --> 00:36:55,256
have the heroine playing
a "Jaws" video game,

898
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,476
as if to say, we get it.

899
00:36:57,519 --> 00:36:59,434
Just forget it. We know it.

900
00:36:59,478 --> 00:37:01,131
We know it's a rip-off.
You know.

901
00:37:01,175 --> 00:37:02,568
We know that you know.

902
00:37:02,611 --> 00:37:05,353
So just forget about it
and have a good time.

903
00:37:05,397 --> 00:37:09,270
- We shot the "Piranha" in
the USC swimming pool.

904
00:37:09,314 --> 00:37:14,275
And we had some fake blood
and one thing and another.

905
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:17,452
And it sort of spread
throughout the swimming pool.

906
00:37:17,496 --> 00:37:21,978
And SC was not happy
with what we had done.

907
00:37:22,022 --> 00:37:24,285
- Whatever it is
that we did caused

908
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:28,333
a fungus to grow
that ate away at the pool

909
00:37:28,376 --> 00:37:31,031
and started to eat--

910
00:37:31,074 --> 00:37:33,816
literally eat--
the paint off the pool.

911
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,688
And so no one could figure out
what it was.

912
00:37:35,731 --> 00:37:37,516
We had to fly scientists
down from Sacramento

913
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:41,171
to figure out what this
creature that we created was.

914
00:37:41,215 --> 00:37:42,521
And they didn't know.

915
00:37:42,564 --> 00:37:44,392
They just said,
we have to just kill it

916
00:37:44,436 --> 00:37:46,307
because we can't let it get
out of the swimming pool.

917
00:37:46,351 --> 00:37:48,962
I mean, it was
almost a better story

918
00:37:49,005 --> 00:37:50,746
than the movie we were making.

919
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:54,097
- They brought "Piranha"
up to a level

920
00:37:54,141 --> 00:37:56,578
where we did rather well.

921
00:37:56,622 --> 00:38:01,496
We still couldn't and never
will compete with "Jaws,"

922
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,716
but we got up a little bit.

923
00:38:03,759 --> 00:38:07,328
- And that basically
led to me--

924
00:38:07,372 --> 00:38:08,808
as Roger often said,
you know, if you make

925
00:38:08,851 --> 00:38:10,026
two good pictures for me,

926
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,898
you'll never have to work
for me again.

927
00:38:11,941 --> 00:38:16,294
And it led to me being offered
other aquatic adventures,

928
00:38:16,337 --> 00:38:20,602
such as "Orca 2," "Barracuda."

929
00:38:20,646 --> 00:38:23,605
I can't even remember all these
aquatic movies that came out

930
00:38:23,649 --> 00:38:25,259
in the wake of "Jaws,"
because there was

931
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:28,610
a tremendous need to imitate
the big blockbuster.

932
00:38:28,654 --> 00:38:31,961
- "Alligator" is definitely
part of the sharksploitation

933
00:38:32,005 --> 00:38:35,269
subgenre as well, because it's
straight up like them saying,

934
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,489
well what else is in the water
that can chase people?

935
00:38:37,532 --> 00:38:39,795
Well, alligators.

936
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:43,712
Basically any time you had
a resort owner, politician,

937
00:38:43,756 --> 00:38:46,367
mayor claiming he could
not close down the beaches

938
00:38:46,411 --> 00:38:47,760
because it's spring break,

939
00:38:47,803 --> 00:38:49,718
4th of July, Labor Day weekend,

940
00:38:49,762 --> 00:38:51,546
it's a "Jaws" rip-off.

941
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:54,680
The idea of having the moment
where we're all gonna stop

942
00:38:54,723 --> 00:38:57,291
and talk to a scientist
about all sharks do

943
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,380
is swim and eat
and make baby sharks.

944
00:38:59,424 --> 00:39:00,816
- And make baby sharks.

945
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,862
- Usually they always have
the same setup,

946
00:39:02,905 --> 00:39:04,690
where the shark begins
hunting.

947
00:39:04,733 --> 00:39:06,344
And then somebody
is gonna be like,

948
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:07,780
"There's nothing out there."

949
00:39:07,823 --> 00:39:09,303
And then one person
will be like,

950
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,000
"Oh, no, there's totally
something out there,"

951
00:39:11,044 --> 00:39:13,655
until there's a whole bunch
of deaths.

952
00:39:13,699 --> 00:39:16,397
And then suddenly everyone
has to pay attention to it.

953
00:39:16,441 --> 00:39:17,529
- You have to close the beach.

954
00:39:17,572 --> 00:39:19,357
- And then one
very heroic male

955
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,923
is gonna go kill the shark.

956
00:39:20,967 --> 00:39:22,447
♪

957
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:27,234
- "Great White"
or "The Last Shark,"

958
00:39:27,277 --> 00:39:29,976
it was one of the most
notorious rip-offs of "Jaws."

959
00:39:30,019 --> 00:39:31,978
- If some of these
sharksploitation films

960
00:39:32,021 --> 00:39:34,676
had kind of been winking
and nodding at "Jaws,"

961
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,852
this one gives it,
like, an outright hug.

962
00:39:36,896 --> 00:39:38,985
- The issue of "Variety"
had a three-page spread

963
00:39:39,028 --> 00:39:40,421
for "Great White."

964
00:39:40,465 --> 00:39:42,205
And they had the poster
and I'm like, well,

965
00:39:42,249 --> 00:39:43,816
obviously
this is a "Jaws" rip-off.

966
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:44,991
And it's from Italy.

967
00:39:45,034 --> 00:39:46,340
And even then,
I knew Italy was like

968
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,211
the province of movie rip-offs.

969
00:39:48,255 --> 00:39:52,477
- Italians were really ripping
off anything back then--

970
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:57,264
"Mad Max," "The Exorcist,"
"Rambo," "Dawn of the Dead,"

971
00:39:57,307 --> 00:39:59,745
and, of course, "Jaws."

972
00:39:59,788 --> 00:40:02,922
- Universal decided
that "Great White"

973
00:40:02,965 --> 00:40:08,275
was a copy of "Jaws"
and "Jaws 2."

974
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:10,233
So there were
so many similarities

975
00:40:10,277 --> 00:40:12,366
that they felt they had
a pretty good case,

976
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,238
so they took legal action.

977
00:40:15,282 --> 00:40:17,458
And we got cease and desist.

978
00:40:17,502 --> 00:40:19,591
And we couldn't do anything
with it anymore.

979
00:40:19,634 --> 00:40:23,508
And they--I think they
even confiscated the prints.

980
00:40:23,551 --> 00:40:26,162
So we were dead in the water.

981
00:40:26,206 --> 00:40:27,686
- And I read about that
and I'm like,

982
00:40:27,729 --> 00:40:29,427
now I'm never gonna get
to see this thing.

983
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:31,254
And little did I know,
I wouldn't even

984
00:40:31,298 --> 00:40:34,127
get to see it on video
for years and years and years.

985
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:35,998
And then
I finally got to see it.

986
00:40:36,042 --> 00:40:38,871
And I was like, yeah,
they have a case.

987
00:40:38,914 --> 00:40:41,874
This movie is just
ridiculously derivative.

988
00:40:41,917 --> 00:40:43,919
It's like,
how do they even get away

989
00:40:43,963 --> 00:40:45,443
with this in the first place?

990
00:40:45,486 --> 00:40:47,619
You have James Franciscus
as Peter Benton.

991
00:40:47,662 --> 00:40:50,491
And Vic Morrow is a guy,
like, trying

992
00:40:50,535 --> 00:40:51,971
to do a Robert Shaw accent.

993
00:40:52,014 --> 00:40:54,321
I'm not sure what it is
he's doing there.

994
00:40:54,364 --> 00:40:59,500
- Especially once he's had
his taste of human flesh.

995
00:40:59,544 --> 00:41:01,284
- And just scene after scene
ripped off

996

from both "Jaws" and "Jaws 2."

997
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:06,028
They went at it from
every conceivable angle.

998
00:41:10,163 --> 00:41:12,252
- Bruno Mattei was just like,
"You know what?"

999

Let's just do this
with "Cruel Jaws."

1000
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:18,214
And he just blatantly rips
entire scenes,

no fucks given.

1002

it feels like

1035
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:49,436
they got the studio note
of, well, it's a sequel,

1036
00:42:49,479 --> 00:42:51,177
so we need more shark.

1037
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:54,354
And it's not as effective
as you would want it

1038
00:42:54,397 --> 00:42:56,486
to be in a lot of the shots.

1039
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:59,620
- We didn't have the luxury,
in the second film,

1040
00:42:59,664 --> 00:43:01,143
of hiding the shark.

1041
00:43:01,187 --> 00:43:03,537
Everybody knew
what the shark looked like.

1042
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:06,279
But we wanted him to be
a fearsome creature.

1043
00:43:06,322 --> 00:43:09,151
And in the opening sequence
where we see

1044
00:43:09,195 --> 00:43:10,413
the shark for the first time,

1045
00:43:10,457 --> 00:43:12,198
where he's chasing
the water skier

1046
00:43:12,241 --> 00:43:15,331
and the panicky boater throws
a can of gasoline,

1047
00:43:15,375 --> 00:43:17,507
it explodes, and the shark's
face is burned,

1048
00:43:17,551 --> 00:43:22,208
that was kind of
a calculated move to say,

1049
00:43:22,251 --> 00:43:23,905
yes, you think you've
seen the shark.

1050
00:43:23,949 --> 00:43:28,344
But this is not just the shark,
it's like Scarface shark.

1051
00:43:28,388 --> 00:43:31,086
You know,
this time he's really angry.

1052
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:32,653
- That, of course, sparked,
you know,

1053
00:43:32,697 --> 00:43:33,959
"just when you thought
it was safe to go

1054
00:43:34,002 --> 00:43:36,091
back in the water,"
which is probably

1055
00:43:36,135 --> 00:43:37,527
the most famous tagline.

1056
00:43:37,571 --> 00:43:39,660
And it's been, you know,
parodied

1057
00:43:39,704 --> 00:43:43,185
and spun off on ever since.

1058
00:43:43,229 --> 00:43:45,013
But it's just become
so associated

1059
00:43:45,057 --> 00:43:46,449
with the whole franchise.

1060
00:43:46,493 --> 00:43:48,277
And it may be one
of the things people

1061
00:43:48,321 --> 00:43:49,801
most remember about that film.

1062
00:43:49,844 --> 00:43:51,759
- The second "Jaws" movie
had come out right

1063
00:43:51,803 --> 00:43:53,065
around the time of "Piranha."

1064
00:43:53,108 --> 00:43:54,719
And for whatever reason,
Universal

1065
00:43:54,762 --> 00:43:56,982
was very concerned and annoyed
that Roger was putting out

1066
00:43:57,025 --> 00:43:59,898
his rip-off of "Jaws"
the same year

1067
00:43:59,941 --> 00:44:01,464
that "Jaws 2" was coming out.

1068
00:44:01,508 --> 00:44:04,250
And so they apparently
threatened an injunction.

1069
00:44:04,293 --> 00:44:08,950
And I discovered much later
that Spielberg had stepped in

1070
00:44:08,994 --> 00:44:11,692
to Universal and apparently
had seen "Piranha"

1071
00:44:11,736 --> 00:44:12,911
and said, no, you don't get it.

1072
00:44:12,954 --> 00:44:14,564
This is a spoof.

1073
00:44:14,608 --> 00:44:17,306
This isn't really a rip-off,
although it is a rip-off.

1074
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:23,312
And we basically got away with
it, I guess is the phrase.

1075
00:44:23,356 --> 00:44:27,316
And because of that, I was
offered "Jaws 3, People 0,"

1076
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,579
which was
a combination production

1077
00:44:29,623 --> 00:44:32,495
between The National Lampoon
and Universal Pictures.

1078
00:44:35,194 --> 00:44:37,239
- I was over at Universal.

1079
00:44:37,283 --> 00:44:39,677
My next-door neighbors
were Zanuck and Brown,

1080
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,026
Dick Zanuck and David Brown.

1081
00:44:41,069 --> 00:44:42,897
And he, first thing he said
to me, is Dick and I

1082
00:44:42,941 --> 00:44:45,813
would love to make
a movie with you guys.

1083
00:44:45,857 --> 00:44:48,947
So out of the blue, I just
started kidding around.

1084
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:53,429
And I said,
"Jaws 3, People Nothing."

1085
00:44:53,473 --> 00:44:55,214
I said,
Peter Benchley walks out

1086
00:44:55,257 --> 00:44:57,564
of his house
in a bathing suit,

1087
00:44:57,607 --> 00:44:59,871
jumps into his pool,
and disappears.

1088
00:44:59,914 --> 00:45:01,568
And the next thing,
we see a fin

1089
00:45:01,611 --> 00:45:03,570
floating around in the pool.

1090
00:45:03,613 --> 00:45:05,354
I said, I know it's ridiculous.

1091
00:45:05,398 --> 00:45:06,834
He's, "No, no, go on."

1092
00:45:06,878 --> 00:45:10,272
So I had no idea
where I was going, but I went.

1093
00:45:10,316 --> 00:45:12,274
And he said,
"I love it. I love it.

1094
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:14,755
I'll call you tomorrow.
We're gonna make this movie."

1095
00:45:14,799 --> 00:45:17,976
As soon as I got the call
from David Brown telling me

1096
00:45:18,019 --> 00:45:20,674
that the studio is doing
the movie, I left my office

1097
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:22,545
and I walked into
the editorial office.

1098
00:45:22,589 --> 00:45:23,895
I knew who I was looking for.

1099
00:45:23,938 --> 00:45:25,723
And I walked over
to the two of them.

1100
00:45:25,766 --> 00:45:28,813
I said, Tod, you,
and I turned to the other,

1101
00:45:28,856 --> 00:45:31,076
the first--the guy
I was really looking for,

1102
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:32,599
John Hughes.

1103
00:45:32,642 --> 00:45:34,906
I said, John, you and Tod
are writing this script.

1104
00:45:34,949 --> 00:45:36,995
And I handed him
the short story.

1105
00:45:37,038 --> 00:45:41,216
And then I hired Joe Dante
to direct the picture.

1106
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:43,741
- The National Lampoon people
wanted to make an R-rated

1107
00:45:43,784 --> 00:45:45,786
comedy like "Animal House."

1108
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:50,008
And the more conservative
Zanuck and Brown team

1109
00:45:50,051 --> 00:45:53,359
wanted to make it PG
and have it be a wide release,

1110
00:45:53,402 --> 00:45:54,621
family picture.

1111
00:45:54,664 --> 00:45:56,928
- First of all,
Bo Derek was nude

1112
00:45:56,971 --> 00:45:59,887
from the waist up
through much of--

1113
00:45:59,931 --> 00:46:01,541
a good deal of the picture.

1114
00:46:01,584 --> 00:46:04,109
And secondly, that's what
we made, was R-rated movies.

1115
00:46:04,152 --> 00:46:07,852
The National Lampoon
did not make PG movies.

1116
00:46:07,895 --> 00:46:10,724
- I guess
wiser heads prevailed.

1117
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,987
And I think it was, you know,
Sid Sheinberg

1118
00:46:13,031 --> 00:46:17,383
and maybe Lew Wasserman
and certainly Spielberg.

1119
00:46:17,426 --> 00:46:20,125
They said, why do you
want to take, you know,

1120
00:46:20,168 --> 00:46:23,737
a great franchise and mock it?

1121
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:26,479
- I think the project died
because they just

1122
00:46:26,522 --> 00:46:28,046
couldn't agree on what movie
they were making.

1123
00:46:28,089 --> 00:46:30,831
And you can't go into a movie
with two entities

1124
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:32,790
as powerful as The Lampoon was
at that time

1125
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:33,921
and Zanuck and Brown

1126
00:46:33,965 --> 00:46:35,531
and have them fighting
constantly

1127
00:46:35,575 --> 00:46:36,881
through the entire movie.

1128
00:46:36,924 --> 00:46:39,753
It's just a bad idea.

1129
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:42,060
And I think
they just pulled the plug.

1130
00:46:42,103 --> 00:46:43,975
- So they had to choose
between me and Spielberg.

1131
00:46:44,018 --> 00:46:45,977
And I suspect
they made the right choice.

1132
00:46:48,066 --> 00:46:50,590
- They were gonna do
"Jaws 3, People 0."

1133
00:46:50,633 --> 00:46:53,375
So Verna said,
"Go talk to Landsburg."

1134
00:46:53,419 --> 00:46:54,550
They came back.

1135
00:46:54,594 --> 00:46:56,204
I got the directing job.

1136
00:46:56,248 --> 00:47:00,034
And they got all excited about
doing this 3D "Jaws" movie.

1137
00:47:00,078 --> 00:47:03,646
And so that was it.

1138
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:06,214
Then, that's--
my problem started.

1139
00:47:06,258 --> 00:47:09,478
- Because it was 3D,
there was an awful--

1140
00:47:09,522 --> 00:47:13,874
an awful lot of complicated
technical requirements

1141
00:47:13,918 --> 00:47:15,267
for the filming.

1142
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:17,399
There wasn't much I could do

1143
00:47:17,443 --> 00:47:19,314
to write new props
or new scenery

1144
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:20,838
or new action,
because it had all

1145
00:47:20,881 --> 00:47:23,928
been storyboarded
very carefully for 3D,

1146
00:47:23,971 --> 00:47:26,234
which has its own requirements.

1147
00:47:26,278 --> 00:47:29,020
- Let me tell you something
about 3D.

1148
00:47:29,063 --> 00:47:30,673
Here's our screen proportion.

1149
00:47:30,717 --> 00:47:32,371
We're taking 35 millimeter.

1150
00:47:32,414 --> 00:47:34,199
So this is your
screen proportion.

1151
00:47:34,242 --> 00:47:38,029
Now, if it was a snake,
you could slide that out

1152
00:47:38,072 --> 00:47:40,553
right out into the audience.

1153
00:47:40,596 --> 00:47:42,685
But they have a thing
called the dorsal fin.

1154
00:47:42,729 --> 00:47:45,775
And as soon as the dorsal fin
hits the pickup,

1155
00:47:45,819 --> 00:47:47,255
it stops.

1156
00:47:47,299 --> 00:47:50,955
So that damn dorsal fin
kills you on 3D.

1157
00:47:50,998 --> 00:47:52,957
I could get the head out
a little bit,

1158
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,089
but I couldn't get it
into the audience.

1159
00:47:55,133 --> 00:47:56,917
Oh, I had kids.

1160
00:47:56,961 --> 00:47:58,701
There were things in the park.

1161
00:47:58,745 --> 00:48:01,748
I had an octopus thing goes
out and other things go out.

1162
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:05,099
And of course, the studio,
they just throw stuff out.

1163
00:48:05,143 --> 00:48:06,405
Wasn't my concept.

1164
00:48:06,448 --> 00:48:09,060
My concept for 3D
was the depth.

1165
00:48:09,103 --> 00:48:11,932
But no, no, no,
you gotta throw stuff out.

1166
00:48:11,976 --> 00:48:13,934
- I remember
from the beginning, like,

1167
00:48:13,978 --> 00:48:15,588
you expect it's a 3D "Jaws,"

1168
00:48:15,631 --> 00:48:17,329
they're gonna open
with something really great.

1169
00:48:17,372 --> 00:48:19,113
And the first big 3D effect

1170
00:48:19,157 --> 00:48:22,638
is a fish head floating
into your face.

1171
00:48:22,682 --> 00:48:24,466
- For me, "Jaws 3" is where

1172
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:26,468
"Jaws" becomes
an exploitation movie.

1173
00:48:26,512 --> 00:48:28,688
It's where "Jaws" literally
jumps the shark.

1174
00:48:28,731 --> 00:48:32,039
Because it really is trying
to do something different

1175
00:48:32,083 --> 00:48:34,346
to set itself apart
from itself.

1176
00:48:34,389 --> 00:48:36,652
- I saw "Jaws 3" too late.

1177
00:48:36,696 --> 00:48:39,612
Like I was--you know,
"Independence Day"

1178
00:48:39,655 --> 00:48:42,180
had been made and all
these great VFX movies.

1179
00:48:42,223 --> 00:48:44,704
And I think I just saw through
all of, like,

1180
00:48:44,747 --> 00:48:49,187
the weird shark floating
towards the glass,

1181
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:50,884
like, then the glass, like,

1182
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:53,452
mysteriously breaks
towards the screen.

1183
00:48:53,495 --> 00:48:55,541
And I mean, fuck,
it's good, actually,

1184
00:48:55,584 --> 00:48:56,846
the more you think about it.

1185
00:48:56,890 --> 00:48:59,153
- The shark is moving
with the speed

1186
00:48:59,197 --> 00:49:02,200
and ferocity
of the Goodyear blimp.

1187
00:49:02,243 --> 00:49:03,679
And it's the climax
of the movie.

1188
00:49:03,723 --> 00:49:05,812
It's supposed to go
bang, crash,

1189
00:49:05,855 --> 00:49:08,684
boom, collapse, broken glass,

1190
00:49:08,728 --> 00:49:10,686
water flooding in, everything.

1191
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:13,124
But the shark's approach
just takes forever.

1192
00:49:13,167 --> 00:49:15,039
You go, "One, one thousand,
two, one thousand..."

1193
00:49:15,082 --> 00:49:16,518
He's gonna hit the screen
any minute.

1194
00:49:16,562 --> 00:49:19,565
And it's 3D, so he's--he's--

1195
00:49:19,608 --> 00:49:22,133
the shark is coming
at the screen.

1196
00:49:22,176 --> 00:49:26,311
So the climactic shot
of the movie is dog shit.

1197
00:49:26,354 --> 00:49:30,358
- When people talk to me about
1, 2, or 3 for various scenes.

1198
00:49:30,402 --> 00:49:32,491
But nobody ever mentions 4.

1199
00:49:32,534 --> 00:49:34,362
- I mean, the problem
with "Jaws, The Revenge"

1200
00:49:34,406 --> 00:49:36,234
was it was a joke
before it even opened.

1201
00:49:36,277 --> 00:49:38,540
Because that tagline,
"This time it's personal,"

1202
00:49:38,584 --> 00:49:40,673
I don't know
who came up with that one.

1203
00:49:40,716 --> 00:49:43,067
But again, it made the film
kind of a punchline

1204
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:44,372
before it even opened.

1205
00:49:44,416 --> 00:49:47,462
- "Jaws, The Revenge"
comes out in 1987.

1206
00:49:47,506 --> 00:49:50,813
And though I'm sure adults
and critics at the time

1207
00:49:50,857 --> 00:49:55,427
fucking hated that movie,
I loved "Jaws, The Revenge."

1208
00:49:55,470 --> 00:49:57,168
Like, it knows
what it's doing.

1209
00:49:57,211 --> 00:50:00,171
It is the shark
that has telepathically

1210
00:50:00,214 --> 00:50:02,564
chased the family.

1211
00:50:02,608 --> 00:50:04,175
So it functions
as a straight-up slasher,

1212
00:50:04,218 --> 00:50:06,090
because it is
specifically targeting

1213
00:50:06,133 --> 00:50:08,614
members of this family
and trying

1214
00:50:08,657 --> 00:50:11,051
to find ways to get them.

1215
00:50:11,095 --> 00:50:13,401
Now, at that point,
logic might say,

1216
00:50:13,445 --> 00:50:14,837
like, well,
just don't go in the water.

1217
00:50:14,881 --> 00:50:17,231
Like, if Jason can only
kill you in the water,

1218
00:50:17,275 --> 00:50:18,319
you just don't go in the water.

1219
00:50:18,363 --> 00:50:19,755
- And I remember
at a certain point

1220
00:50:19,799 --> 00:50:20,974
I was reading the script.

1221
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:23,977
And there was a part
where Lorraine Gary

1222
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:25,413
realizes that it's personal,

1223
00:50:25,457 --> 00:50:27,676
the shark is coming after
her children.

1224
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,505
And she's so infuriated
that she gets in the ship

1225
00:50:30,549 --> 00:50:32,377
and she goes out
after the shark.

1226
00:50:34,118 --> 00:50:36,685
Now, I said,
that's some white people stuff.

1227
00:50:36,729 --> 00:50:40,080
Now, I said, what is the plan?

1228
00:50:40,124 --> 00:50:42,256
Now, we've seen
this big-ass shark

1229
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:43,910
the size of a school bus,

1230
00:50:43,953 --> 00:50:46,043
you know, kill up
a whole lot of people.

1231
00:50:46,086 --> 00:50:48,219
Why is she going in this...
[laughing]

1232
00:50:48,262 --> 00:50:49,307
What is she doing?

1233
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:50,482
What's the plan?
She's gonna poke it?

1234
00:50:50,525 --> 00:50:51,613
She's gonna hit it with her--

1235
00:50:51,657 --> 00:50:52,875
she's gonna punch it out
like Rocky?

1236
00:50:52,919 --> 00:50:54,094
What is--does she have
a bazooka?

1237
00:50:54,138 --> 00:50:55,139
Does she have an army?

1238
00:50:55,182 --> 00:50:56,227
What does she got?

1239
00:50:57,489 --> 00:51:03,712
- It's a very strange,
strange sequel.

1240
00:51:03,756 --> 00:51:06,672
I think the TV version,
where of course,

1241
00:51:06,715 --> 00:51:09,588
I had to pause it where
there's this very fake-looking

1242
00:51:09,631 --> 00:51:13,113
shark with, like,
a toy boat stuck through it

1243
00:51:13,157 --> 00:51:17,378
that explodes,
that is insanely ridiculous.

1244
00:51:17,422 --> 00:51:23,471
I remember the shark roaring
like a Godzilla monster a lot.

1245
00:51:23,515 --> 00:51:24,951
[shark roaring]

1246
00:51:24,994 --> 00:51:27,214
- Everyone blames
the end of "Jaws, The Revenge"

1247
00:51:27,258 --> 00:51:29,390
for the introduction
of the shark roar.

1248
00:51:29,434 --> 00:51:32,045
But it happens in "Jaws 3."

1249
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:35,266
There's a scene where the shark
is starting to surface.

1250
00:51:35,309 --> 00:51:39,226
Its giant jaws--its lips
curl back and its mouth opens.

1251
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:43,317
It just belches out
this deep, guttural roar.

1252
00:51:43,361 --> 00:51:44,840
And it's like, wait, what?

1253
00:51:44,884 --> 00:51:46,233
Why is it roaring?

1254
00:51:46,277 --> 00:51:47,974
- If you're gonna have a shark,
you know,

1255
00:51:48,017 --> 00:51:50,324
coming to bite
somebody's head clean off

1256
00:51:50,368 --> 00:51:51,847
as they're flying
through the air,

1257
00:51:51,891 --> 00:51:53,240
there has to be a growl.

1258
00:51:53,284 --> 00:51:54,328
There has to be.

1259
00:51:54,372 --> 00:51:55,329
[shark growling]

1260
00:51:55,373 --> 00:51:57,418
- I always put shark roars

1261
00:51:57,462 --> 00:51:58,854
in the movies

1262
00:51:58,898 --> 00:52:00,073
whenever the shark's
out of the water,

1263
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:01,422
because
I feel like it adds a lot.

1264
00:52:01,466 --> 00:52:04,730
It feels--watching it
without any shark sounds

1265
00:52:04,773 --> 00:52:06,079
feels really wrong, I think.

1266
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:08,734
[laughs] But I know--

1267
00:52:08,777 --> 00:52:10,083
I know sharks don't roar.

1268
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:11,389
But maybe they do.
I don't know.

1269
00:52:11,432 --> 00:52:12,477
You know, who knows?

1270
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,957
- Yeah, sharks growl
in movies a lot.

1271
00:52:15,001 --> 00:52:16,698
Sharks can't make noises,

1272
00:52:16,742 --> 00:52:19,571
so that's not happening
in real life.

1273
00:52:19,614 --> 00:52:21,747
Sharks can hear pretty well,
but they hear

1274
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:23,183
sort of low frequency sounds.

1275
00:52:23,227 --> 00:52:25,316
They can hear something
splashing over here

1276
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:27,056
or something's thrashing
over here.

1277
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:29,755
But sharks do not communicate
audibly.

1278
00:52:29,798 --> 00:52:32,366
So there's a--Hollywood has
a rich tradition

1279
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:34,586
of substituting
one animal noise for another.

1280
00:52:40,635 --> 00:52:43,421
- When we get to about
the mid-'90s,

1281
00:52:43,464 --> 00:52:45,771
shark movies weren't
in big supply.

1282
00:52:45,814 --> 00:52:48,077
- I think once
"Jaws, The Revenge" tanked

1283
00:52:48,121 --> 00:52:49,775
at the box office,
it sort of killed

1284
00:52:49,818 --> 00:52:51,733
the sharksploitation genre
for a while.

1285
00:52:51,777 --> 00:52:53,648
- People was not
interested in shark.

1286
00:52:53,692 --> 00:52:54,954
They didn't want nature movie.

1287
00:52:54,997 --> 00:52:56,738
They want
big blockbuster movie.

1288
00:52:56,782 --> 00:52:58,349
They wanted sci-fi movies.

1289
00:52:58,392 --> 00:53:00,786
If they wanted
an animal on screen,

1290
00:53:00,829 --> 00:53:02,048
it had to be a dinosaur.

1291
00:53:02,091 --> 00:53:04,877
They wanted big,
bigger, biggest.

1292
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,531
- And then "Deep Blue Sea"
came in,

1293
00:53:06,574 --> 00:53:09,534
and things just exploded.

1294
00:53:09,577 --> 00:53:12,058
- When Renny Harlin
made "Deep Blue Sea,"

1295
00:53:12,101 --> 00:53:14,669
he had only one aim in mind:

1296
00:53:14,713 --> 00:53:17,933
to make the shark movie
fun again.

1297
00:53:17,977 --> 00:53:20,588
- That was a return
to true shark form.

1298
00:53:20,632 --> 00:53:24,288
- I believe that came out
a little bit after "Anaconda."

1299
00:53:24,331 --> 00:53:26,246
So there is this cool thing

1300
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:28,248
of animals
from the actual Earth

1301
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:29,641
scary again.

1302
00:53:29,684 --> 00:53:31,033
And then the other thing
that I liked about it is,

1303
00:53:31,077 --> 00:53:34,167
like, it started with this idea
of science.

1304
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,691
- And it was a cool plot,
because it was

1305
00:53:36,735 --> 00:53:37,953
legitimizing it.

1306
00:53:37,997 --> 00:53:40,608
It was suddenly back
what "Jaws" did,

1307
00:53:40,652 --> 00:53:42,871
where it was feeding you
science and using it

1308
00:53:42,915 --> 00:53:44,482
to make the movie seem legit.

1309
00:53:44,525 --> 00:53:46,266
"Wait, sharks can't
get Alzheimer's?

1310
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:47,659
"Sharks don't get cancer?

1311
00:53:47,702 --> 00:53:49,138
"Well, that's kind of crazy.

1312
00:53:49,182 --> 00:53:51,228
Cool premise for a movie."

1313
00:53:51,271 --> 00:53:53,317
- Sharks never get cancer
or go blind

1314
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:56,711
or show any loss
of brain activity as they age,

1315
00:53:56,755 --> 00:53:58,670
unlike some people I know.

1316
00:53:58,713 --> 00:54:00,411
- Sharks
absolutely get cancer.

1317
00:54:00,454 --> 00:54:02,500
The first documented case
of shark cancer

1318
00:54:02,543 --> 00:54:04,066
was in the 1860s,

1319
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:05,677
so it's not a new thing.

1320
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:08,941
Sharks are the subject of some
actual biomedical research.

1321
00:54:08,984 --> 00:54:11,291
Their healing abilities,
in particular,

1322
00:54:11,335 --> 00:54:12,988
are really remarkable,

1323
00:54:13,032 --> 00:54:15,252
and the Department of Defense
is interested in that

1324
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:17,341
to help wounded soldiers.

1325
00:54:17,384 --> 00:54:20,866
And there are some diseases
that shark physiology

1326
00:54:20,909 --> 00:54:22,737
or immune systems are
more resistant to,

1327
00:54:22,781 --> 00:54:25,436
but sharks
absolutely do get cancer.

1328
00:54:25,479 --> 00:54:27,699
- These killer sharks
were man-made.

1329
00:54:27,742 --> 00:54:30,005
So there is this whole point
that this is not

1330
00:54:30,049 --> 00:54:31,572
how actual sharks would act.

1331
00:54:31,616 --> 00:54:35,141
These were like
super killer sharks.

1332
00:54:35,184 --> 00:54:36,664
- They recognize that gun.

1333
00:54:36,708 --> 00:54:37,970
- It's impossible.

1334
00:54:38,013 --> 00:54:39,885
Sharks do not swim backwards.
They can't.

1335
00:54:39,928 --> 00:54:42,627
- So it also made the storyline
a lot more digestible.

1336
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:45,673
It kind of put the blame back
on humans, which I liked.

1337
00:54:45,717 --> 00:54:47,022
- It was funny,
because it seemed

1338
00:54:47,066 --> 00:54:48,633
like a very B-movie idea.

1339
00:54:48,676 --> 00:54:51,462
You know, genetically enhanced
sharks attacking people.

1340
00:54:51,505 --> 00:54:54,291
And at the time, not
many major studio movies

1341
00:54:54,334 --> 00:54:57,076
were being made on these
kind of B-horror subjects.

1342
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:00,122
They do properly the scene
that "Jaws 3-D" did not,

1343
00:55:00,166 --> 00:55:03,387
the shattering of
the undersea viewing window.

1344
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:05,737
Because there's
a scene where the shark throws

1345
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:07,652
Stellan Skarsgard
against the glass,

1346
00:55:07,695 --> 00:55:09,610
and it cracks.

1347
00:55:09,654 --> 00:55:10,785
And while I was watching that,
I'm like,

1348
00:55:10,829 --> 00:55:12,526
someone on here
must have decided,

1349
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:13,919
you know, "We wanted to see

1350
00:55:13,962 --> 00:55:15,573
"that scene
in 'Jaws 3-D' done right,

1351
00:55:15,616 --> 00:55:16,922
so let's do it here."

1352
00:55:19,272 --> 00:55:20,534
- The practical effects

1353
00:55:20,578 --> 00:55:22,362
in "Deep Blue Sea"
are phenomenal.

1354
00:55:22,406 --> 00:55:23,798
And the CG effects--
I love it.

1355
00:55:23,842 --> 00:55:25,974
I think in the commentary,
Renny is like,

1356
00:55:26,018 --> 00:55:29,021
"I challenge you
to tell the difference."

1357
00:55:29,064 --> 00:55:30,849
I'm like, "Renny,
that one, that one,

1358
00:55:30,892 --> 00:55:32,546
that one, that one, that one."

1359
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:35,244
The CG is absolute bullshit
in that.

1360
00:55:35,288 --> 00:55:37,116
You know, sorry, Renny.

1361
00:55:37,159 --> 00:55:38,770
- I don't know if anybody had

1362
00:55:38,813 --> 00:55:40,598
big expectation
for the movies,

1363
00:55:40,641 --> 00:55:45,254
but when the movie came out,
it totally exploded again.

1364
00:55:45,298 --> 00:55:46,952
And actually, the movie
was quite fun also.

1365
00:55:46,995 --> 00:55:48,345
Because the ending
of the movie

1366
00:55:48,388 --> 00:55:50,259
was quite different from
normal American movie,

1367
00:55:50,303 --> 00:55:53,219
because we have
the Black guy surviving,

1368
00:55:53,262 --> 00:55:54,655
we have the white girl dying.

1369
00:55:54,699 --> 00:55:58,355
So it was quite different
from the normal recipe

1370
00:55:58,398 --> 00:55:59,704
from Hollywood.

1371
00:55:59,747 --> 00:56:02,271
And in the movie,
you had a big name.

1372
00:56:02,315 --> 00:56:03,708
You had Samuel L. Jackson.

1373
00:56:03,751 --> 00:56:06,406
And he was seen
as one of the big parts,

1374
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:09,496
and making this
very inspirational speech,

1375
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:11,542
the big speech,
talking about how

1376
00:56:11,585 --> 00:56:13,761
they've got to get together
and save the day.

1377
00:56:13,805 --> 00:56:16,416
And in the middle
of the scene--spoiler alert--

1378
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:19,201
a shark jumps up
and just eat him

1379
00:56:19,245 --> 00:56:20,768
right in front of the camera.

1380
00:56:20,812 --> 00:56:22,727
And everybody who watched
the movie for the first time

1381
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:25,294
was just, "What?
What's happening?"

1382
00:56:25,338 --> 00:56:27,471
- So shocking
and so surprising.

1383
00:56:27,514 --> 00:56:30,561
And I think that also
kicked off a competition

1384
00:56:30,604 --> 00:56:32,127
among the makers
of sharksploitation movies

1385
00:56:32,171 --> 00:56:34,042
to have
the most outlandish deaths.

1386
00:56:34,086 --> 00:56:35,609
It wasn't just about timing.

1387
00:56:35,653 --> 00:56:38,264
It was about, how stupid
and crazy can these deaths be?

1388
00:56:38,307 --> 00:56:39,265
[man yelling]

1389
00:56:39,308 --> 00:56:41,006
[crunching]

1390
00:56:41,049 --> 00:56:42,660
I mean, really,
you could almost trace it

1391
00:56:42,703 --> 00:56:44,705
all the way back to "Jaws 3."

1392
00:56:44,749 --> 00:56:47,229
Because it was in 3D,
I think they felt compelled

1393
00:56:47,273 --> 00:56:51,843
to amplify the deaths
and make them even crazier

1394
00:56:51,886 --> 00:56:53,322
than we've seen before.

1395
00:56:53,366 --> 00:56:57,936
- There's a scene
which haunts me, you know,

1396
00:56:57,979 --> 00:57:00,286
where there's a shark hunter.

1397
00:57:00,329 --> 00:57:03,158
And he goes toe--

1398
00:57:03,202 --> 00:57:06,379
goes one on one
with the shark and gets eaten.

1399
00:57:07,859 --> 00:57:12,037
But they cut to inside
of the shark

1400
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,386
with him getting eaten.

1401
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:15,475
You know, the jaws
are opening and closing,

1402
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:17,346
and he's, like,
fighting for his life.

1403
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:20,524
And just the sound effects
and the way

1404
00:57:20,567 --> 00:57:24,441
he's fighting for his life,
trying to get out,

1405
00:57:24,484 --> 00:57:27,531
is really disturbing.

1406
00:57:27,574 --> 00:57:28,749
- There's another great death

1407
00:57:28,793 --> 00:57:30,272
in a movie called
"Atomic Shark"

1408
00:57:30,316 --> 00:57:32,100
where this kid
is on the beach,

1409
00:57:32,144 --> 00:57:33,580
buried up to his neck
in sand.

1410
00:57:33,624 --> 00:57:36,627
And this shark just comes
riding up on the beach.

1411
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:40,500
And the kid just explodes,
because the shark is atomic.

1412
00:57:40,544 --> 00:57:42,284
You see a lot of deaths
like this

1413
00:57:42,328 --> 00:57:43,329
in the Nu Image movies.

1414
00:57:43,372 --> 00:57:45,505
They made "Shark Zone,"

1415
00:57:45,549 --> 00:57:48,203
"Raging Sharks,"
"Sharks in Venice."

1416
00:57:48,247 --> 00:57:51,946
And let's not forget
"Shark Attack 3: Megalodon."

1417
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:54,383
- Nothing could have prepared
me for this movie,

1418
00:57:54,427 --> 00:57:57,212
because this was truly
the triumph

1419
00:57:57,256 --> 00:58:00,259
of just how fucking bonkers
you can get.

1420
00:58:00,302 --> 00:58:03,697
- "Shark Attack 3" just
goes completely for broke.

1421
00:58:03,741 --> 00:58:05,438
I think at that point,
it was that point

1422
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:07,179
in a franchise
where it's like,

1423
00:58:07,222 --> 00:58:08,615
"We know we have
a built-in audience.

1424
00:58:08,659 --> 00:58:10,182
Let's just go crazy."

1425
00:58:10,225 --> 00:58:12,880
- But what
"Shark Attack 3: Megalodon"

1426
00:58:12,924 --> 00:58:15,622
has become known for
is the greatest line

1427
00:58:15,666 --> 00:58:16,971
in all of cinema.

1428
00:58:17,015 --> 00:58:19,234
Because in
"Shark Attack 3: Megalodon,"

1429
00:58:19,278 --> 00:58:21,498
we still have
the same setup of the guy

1430
00:58:21,541 --> 00:58:22,847
who thinks there
may be something

1431
00:58:22,890 --> 00:58:24,065
out there, killing people,

1432
00:58:24,109 --> 00:58:25,327
but in this time, we have

1433
00:58:25,371 --> 00:58:26,938
the sexy scientist
who is there.

1434
00:58:26,981 --> 00:58:29,549
And she's trying to, you know,
give him the whole primer

1435
00:58:29,593 --> 00:58:31,290
on sharks and what could
and couldn't be.

1436
00:58:31,333 --> 00:58:32,509
And they've had

1437
00:58:32,552 --> 00:58:33,510
a very professional
relationship

1438
00:58:33,553 --> 00:58:34,772
up to this point.

1439
00:58:34,815 --> 00:58:36,991
- So we're at the end
of a long shooting day.

1440
00:58:37,035 --> 00:58:38,732
And we have the camera
on a crane

1441
00:58:38,776 --> 00:58:40,168
and we've done this shot.

1442
00:58:40,212 --> 00:58:42,867
And it's--and
everything's happened.

1443
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:44,477
And we're getting
ready to wrap.

1444
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:45,565
And John comes up to me
and says,

1445
00:58:45,609 --> 00:58:46,827
"Can we do another one?

1446
00:58:46,871 --> 00:58:49,482
I'd like to say
something funny to Jenny."

1447
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:52,311
I said, "Sure.
Everybody back to one."

1448
00:58:52,354 --> 00:58:55,967
So we have a big crane shot
overlooking the harbor.

1449
00:58:56,010 --> 00:58:59,448
And we come down on them
and the two shot.

1450
00:58:59,492 --> 00:59:00,624
And the other guy drives off.

1451
00:59:00,667 --> 00:59:01,712
"See you tomorrow morning."

1452
00:59:01,755 --> 00:59:02,713
- I'm exhausted.

1453
00:59:02,756 --> 00:59:03,931
- Yeah, me too.

1454
00:59:03,975 --> 00:59:06,717
But you know, I'm really wired.

1455
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:10,198
What do you say I take you
home and eat your pussy?

1456
00:59:10,242 --> 00:59:14,551
- I fell out
of my directing chair.

1457
00:59:14,594 --> 00:59:16,378
I couldn't stop laughing.

1458
00:59:16,422 --> 00:59:18,119
I could not stop laughing.

1459
00:59:18,163 --> 00:59:20,426
And nobody
didn't break character.

1460
00:59:20,469 --> 00:59:21,601
Just said it.

1461
00:59:21,645 --> 00:59:22,863
And she was before.

1462
00:59:22,907 --> 00:59:24,517
And she was like so.

1463
00:59:25,649 --> 00:59:26,911
And then we cut.

1464
00:59:26,954 --> 00:59:28,782
It was the funniest thing
I'd ever seen.

1465
00:59:28,826 --> 00:59:32,569
And I made the editor
put it in the film

1466
00:59:32,612 --> 00:59:34,701
because every time
I saw it in the film,

1467
00:59:34,745 --> 00:59:36,747
I fell off the chair laughing.

1468
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:38,749
I just thought
it was fantastic.

1469
00:59:38,792 --> 00:59:42,100
And I said to myself,

1470
00:59:42,143 --> 00:59:45,233
"I'm going to leave this
in the film

1471
00:59:45,277 --> 00:59:49,281
until a producer tells me
to take it out."

1472
00:59:53,807 --> 00:59:56,462
- I came on to Syfy
pretty much

1473
00:59:56,505 --> 00:59:58,029
right after
the channel launched.

1474
00:59:58,072 --> 01:00:01,032
I was originally
the head of acquisitions.

1475
01:00:01,075 --> 01:00:02,337
Syfy was new,

1476
01:00:02,381 --> 01:00:03,730
and we didn't have
a whole lot of originals,

1477
01:00:03,774 --> 01:00:05,123
almost no originals.

1478
01:00:05,166 --> 01:00:06,777
And my job was
to fill the schedule.

1479
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:09,127
And I realized
that, well, I can't fill

1480
01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:11,172
the schedule 52 weeks
a year every Saturday night.

1481
01:00:11,216 --> 01:00:12,696
I would love to have
one of these,

1482
01:00:12,739 --> 01:00:14,349
but there's just not
enough good ones to buy

1483
01:00:14,393 --> 01:00:15,742
and not enough available.

1484
01:00:15,786 --> 01:00:18,397
So I said,
"Well, if we can't buy them,

1485
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:19,703
maybe we should make them."

1486
01:00:19,746 --> 01:00:22,662
We started with one
as an experiment.

1487
01:00:22,706 --> 01:00:24,142
And it worked.

1488
01:00:24,185 --> 01:00:25,534
So after that, we said,
"Oh, let's try a few more."

1489
01:00:25,578 --> 01:00:26,840
Management liked the ratings.

1490
01:00:26,884 --> 01:00:27,972
They liked what we were doing.

1491
01:00:28,015 --> 01:00:29,277
"Oh, try another four."

1492
01:00:29,321 --> 01:00:30,757
And after that,
"Try a few more."

1493
01:00:30,801 --> 01:00:33,194
All of a sudden, we were doing
24 movies a year.

1494
01:00:33,238 --> 01:00:35,240
A few years later, we were
actually doing 36 a year.

1495
01:00:35,283 --> 01:00:37,155
We were doing three a month,
which was incredible.

1496
01:00:37,198 --> 01:00:38,765
It was crazy.

1497
01:00:38,809 --> 01:00:40,114
When we first started
doing these movies,

1498
01:00:40,158 --> 01:00:41,899
we didn't go for the big,
over-the-top titles.

1499
01:00:41,942 --> 01:00:44,336
But then we slowly started
getting into titles

1500
01:00:44,379 --> 01:00:45,729
that were a little bit
more over the top.

1501
01:00:45,772 --> 01:00:47,861
And you know, we have
these titles

1502
01:00:47,905 --> 01:00:49,863
that grabbed people's
attention.

1503
01:00:49,907 --> 01:00:52,126
And then the press started
talking about these movies.

1504
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:53,911
And then the audience realized,

1505
01:00:53,954 --> 01:00:55,956
"Oh, these guys are having
a blast.

1506
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,611
These guys are
just having fun."

1507
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:01,788
- These movies are
made off titles.

1508
01:01:01,832 --> 01:01:03,660
The network just, like, looks
at the movies,

1509
01:01:03,703 --> 01:01:06,314
and they're like,
"Okay, we like Sharkacaine

1510
01:01:06,358 --> 01:01:09,143
and we like Mega Shark."

1511
01:01:09,187 --> 01:01:12,930
And let's see
some rough outlines.

1512
01:01:12,973 --> 01:01:14,235
And then it's
like a paragraph.

1513
01:01:14,279 --> 01:01:15,889
And they read it.
They're like, "Mm,

1514
01:01:15,933 --> 01:01:18,109
let's do sort of something
like this instead."

1515
01:01:18,152 --> 01:01:19,719
And then they, like, see
a treatment.

1516
01:01:19,763 --> 01:01:22,374
And then they're like,
"We like the treatment,

1517
01:01:22,417 --> 01:01:24,158
but how about instead of this,
we do this?"

1518
01:01:24,202 --> 01:01:25,986
- I've done pictures
for them before, yeah.

1519
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:28,119
And their process
is basically, you know,

1520
01:01:28,162 --> 01:01:30,425
"Bring us ten ideas and just
throw them around."

1521
01:01:30,469 --> 01:01:32,297
And they may do none
of the ten,

1522
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:34,865
but they may do, like,
the space aliens

1523
01:01:34,908 --> 01:01:35,996
from the first movie you did

1524
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:37,998
and then this giant crustacean

1525
01:01:38,042 --> 01:01:39,565
from the second movie
you had an idea.

1526
01:01:39,608 --> 01:01:40,914
And we'll put those together

1527
01:01:40,958 --> 01:01:42,916
so it's giant crustaceans
from space.

1528
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,570
- And then they
approve the script.

1529
01:01:44,613 --> 01:01:46,485
So it's
this really backwards process

1530
01:01:46,528 --> 01:01:47,921
from what filmmaking
normally is,

1531
01:01:47,965 --> 01:01:49,314
where there's, like, a script,

1532
01:01:49,357 --> 01:01:51,185
and you have this script,
and that's the story,

1533
01:01:51,229 --> 01:01:52,709
and then you get that,
like, financed,

1534
01:01:52,752 --> 01:01:54,841
and it goes through
all the, you know, rigmarole

1535
01:01:54,885 --> 01:01:56,190
that a movie normally does.

1536
01:01:56,234 --> 01:01:58,236
These are literally
just a name.

1537
01:01:58,279 --> 01:02:01,718
[laughs] And that's the--
that's the selling point.

1538
01:02:01,761 --> 01:02:04,895
Like that's the--that's what
the movie is at its core.

1539
01:02:04,938 --> 01:02:07,245
- And when you mix genres,
you actually come up

1540
01:02:07,288 --> 01:02:08,899
with movies that really work.

1541
01:02:08,942 --> 01:02:11,031
You don't have to stick
to the exact same genre.

1542
01:02:11,075 --> 01:02:12,729
You want to take something
people love, sharks,

1543
01:02:12,772 --> 01:02:14,078
and then expand it.

1544
01:02:14,121 --> 01:02:17,037
- And the Asylum really rode
that whole trend.

1545
01:02:17,081 --> 01:02:18,822
- We started off
in arthouse movies.

1546
01:02:18,865 --> 01:02:20,998
And then from there,
we did horror films.

1547
01:02:21,041 --> 01:02:23,174
We were known for--
as a B-horror film,

1548
01:02:23,217 --> 01:02:24,784
you know, slasher movie place.

1549
01:02:24,828 --> 01:02:26,743
And then we were known
to a big segment

1550
01:02:26,786 --> 01:02:29,397
as mockbusters.

1551
01:02:29,441 --> 01:02:32,400
- We've sort of got
a reputation for making

1552
01:02:32,444 --> 01:02:36,013
what the "New York Post"
dubbed mockbusters,

1553
01:02:36,056 --> 01:02:40,757
where we make movies that are
similar in theme and concept

1554
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,715
to big studio releases.

1555
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:44,195
- It's our own genre.

1556
01:02:44,238 --> 01:02:49,591
We took over that,
you know, monocle, and we--

1557
01:02:49,635 --> 01:02:51,245
it's something
that we embraced.

1558
01:02:51,289 --> 01:02:53,595
And we've been
enjoying it ever since.

1559
01:02:53,639 --> 01:02:56,468
We were a young company
that had its own genre.

1560
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:59,645
- Mtv.com--I don't know if
they're still around anymore,

1561
01:02:59,688 --> 01:03:01,429
but they had contacted me
and said,

1562
01:03:01,473 --> 01:03:04,519
"Hey, can you give us
an exclusive on a trailer?"

1563
01:03:04,563 --> 01:03:05,738
And we said yes.

1564
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:07,914
And it went crazy:

1565
01:03:07,958 --> 01:03:10,308
millions, millions of hits.

1566
01:03:10,351 --> 01:03:14,094
And that was our first taste
of a viral success

1567
01:03:14,138 --> 01:03:16,662
of one of the films.

1568
01:03:16,705 --> 01:03:20,100
We were just trying
to make a Godzilla.

1569
01:03:20,144 --> 01:03:22,494
You know, it was
giant creatures.

1570
01:03:22,537 --> 01:03:24,801
And that was one of the things
that the Japanese,

1571
01:03:24,844 --> 01:03:28,892
not surprisingly, you know,
really insisted upon.

1572
01:03:28,935 --> 01:03:30,415
It's gotta be giant.

1573
01:03:30,458 --> 01:03:34,027
And you know, you really have
to be creative in terms

1574
01:03:34,071 --> 01:03:36,900
of, you know, what are you
gonna do with a giant shark?

1575
01:03:36,943 --> 01:03:40,686
Well, of course, you're gonna
take down a jetliner.

1576
01:03:40,729 --> 01:03:41,818
- Holy shit.

1577
01:03:41,861 --> 01:03:43,210
[dramatic music]

1578
01:03:44,908 --> 01:03:46,039
[woman screaming]

1579
01:03:46,083 --> 01:03:47,693
- The fact that a shark
would jump

1580
01:03:47,736 --> 01:03:50,261
all the way up
and take out a jet,

1581
01:03:50,304 --> 01:03:51,784
to me, just was ridiculous.

1582
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:54,656
And I fought to not even
have that shot in the movie

1583
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:55,701
and not even do it.

1584
01:03:55,744 --> 01:03:57,094
And it turned out
to be, I guess,

1585
01:03:57,137 --> 01:04:00,184
one of the most iconic parts
of "Mega Shark."

1586
01:04:00,227 --> 01:04:01,881
- That launched
some more orders

1587
01:04:01,925 --> 01:04:04,188
for more shark
or shark hybrid movies.

1588
01:04:04,231 --> 01:04:07,017
- And you see
a lot of integration.

1589
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:09,541
It's not a shark movie anymore.

1590
01:04:09,584 --> 01:04:13,110
You take the shark as an animal
and then take something else.

1591
01:04:13,153 --> 01:04:16,678
And then you combine it to
make an even more crazy movie.

1592
01:04:16,722 --> 01:04:18,419
Some of the most
well-known is where

1593
01:04:18,463 --> 01:04:22,119
you take, of course, a shark
and combine it with a man.

1594
01:04:22,162 --> 01:04:23,772
So you have a Sharkman.

1595
01:04:23,816 --> 01:04:28,386
But you also see
when you combine two animals.

1596
01:04:28,429 --> 01:04:32,129
The most well-known is perhaps
the movie called "Sharktopus."

1597
01:04:32,172 --> 01:04:34,261
- I said to Roger,
"Roger, I've got a movie

1598
01:04:34,305 --> 01:04:37,264
I want you to make for us
called 'Sharktopus.'"

1599
01:04:37,308 --> 01:04:39,788
And Roger Corman is on
the other end of the line.

1600
01:04:39,832 --> 01:04:40,833
I hear him pause.

1601
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:42,661
He takes a breath.
And he goes,

1602
01:04:42,704 --> 01:04:45,533
"Tom, I have this theory

1603
01:04:45,577 --> 01:04:48,667
"that you can take
the audience to a point,

1604
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:50,538
"but you can't take them
beyond that point.

1605
01:04:50,582 --> 01:04:52,497
"You can only take
the audience so far,

1606
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:55,021
and I think that 'Sharktopus'
goes too far."

1607
01:04:55,065 --> 01:04:56,109
I said, "That's okay, Roger.

1608
01:04:56,153 --> 01:04:57,110
"We'll find
another film with you.

1609
01:04:57,154 --> 01:04:58,372
"I love working with you.

1610
01:04:58,416 --> 01:04:59,591
"I want to work with you
on something else.

1611
01:04:59,634 --> 01:05:00,809
I'll just call the Asylum."

1612
01:05:00,853 --> 01:05:02,768
And I knew by saying that,

1613
01:05:02,811 --> 01:05:05,292
that was gonna kind of get him.

1614
01:05:05,336 --> 01:05:06,946
I hear him take a deep breath
on the other side.

1615
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:10,254
He's like,
"Well, let's not be too hasty.

1616
01:05:10,297 --> 01:05:13,953
I think I can find a way
to make 'Sharktopus' work."

1617
01:05:13,997 --> 01:05:17,522
- And not only
you're combining two animals,

1618
01:05:17,565 --> 01:05:19,089
you're also taking the shark

1619
01:05:19,132 --> 01:05:22,092
out of its normal environment,
the sea,

1620
01:05:22,135 --> 01:05:24,224
and taking it somewhere else.

1621
01:05:24,268 --> 01:05:26,009
- You could be standing
on a street corner

1622
01:05:26,052 --> 01:05:28,098
and the shark can come out
and get you.

1623
01:05:28,141 --> 01:05:30,970
Because that's--
that's the concept now.

1624
01:05:31,014 --> 01:05:33,494
I mean, the logic is,
there's no logic.

1625
01:05:33,538 --> 01:05:35,105
- We have movies
like "Ghost Shark."

1626
01:05:35,148 --> 01:05:36,976
- That movie was so special.

1627
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:38,586
That was like a haunted shark

1628
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:41,981
that would come after you
in bodies of water.

1629
01:05:42,025 --> 01:05:43,417
And then the best part
was that,

1630
01:05:43,461 --> 01:05:44,897
towards the end of the movie,

1631
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:49,641
the bodies of water got
more and more, like, nuanced.

1632
01:05:49,684 --> 01:05:51,730
[laughing] Like--
like, I think it came out

1633
01:05:51,773 --> 01:05:53,775
of, like, sink water,

1634
01:05:53,819 --> 01:05:55,038
steam from a bath.

1635
01:05:55,081 --> 01:05:56,604
- Or you know, if it's raining,

1636
01:05:56,648 --> 01:05:58,998
God forbid, the shark can swim
through the air.

1637
01:05:59,042 --> 01:06:00,260
There's, like,
a bikini car wash,

1638
01:06:00,304 --> 01:06:01,827
and a girl gets, like,
pulled into a bucket.

1639
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:03,350
- Drinking water
might be dangerous.

1640
01:06:03,394 --> 01:06:04,438
A pool could be dangerous.

1641
01:06:04,482 --> 01:06:05,874
A Slip 'N Slide
can be dangerous.

1642
01:06:05,918 --> 01:06:08,399
I usually had a rule
in most of the movies

1643
01:06:08,442 --> 01:06:10,967
that, you know,
adults and teens,

1644
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:13,143
but not kids,
would become victims.

1645
01:06:13,186 --> 01:06:15,710
But in this one,
the director really fought

1646
01:06:15,754 --> 01:06:17,930
for that gag,
which he just felt

1647
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:19,410
was gonna be a great gag.

1648
01:06:19,453 --> 01:06:21,020
I was like, "Okay, let's try
it and see if it works."

1649
01:06:21,064 --> 01:06:22,195
And people love that scene.

1650
01:06:22,239 --> 01:06:23,544
- So that's quite fun

1651
01:06:23,588 --> 01:06:26,069
to see how they're taking
the shark

1652
01:06:26,112 --> 01:06:27,244
away from
its normal environment

1653
01:06:27,287 --> 01:06:29,420
and then put it
in somewhere else.

1654
01:06:29,463 --> 01:06:31,900
You also have movies
like "Nightmare Shark,"

1655
01:06:31,944 --> 01:06:33,815
where the shark
is quite like

1656
01:06:33,859 --> 01:06:35,121
"Nightmare on Elm Street."

1657
01:06:35,165 --> 01:06:37,428
We take the shark
into people's dreams.

1658
01:06:39,517 --> 01:06:41,998
- For the shark TV movies
for the Syfy Channel,

1659
01:06:42,041 --> 01:06:44,826
there's a very specific
shark formula.

1660
01:06:44,870 --> 01:06:47,438
So they are movies
that play out in eight acts

1661
01:06:47,481 --> 01:06:49,222
with seven commercial breaks.

1662
01:06:49,266 --> 01:06:52,530
And you're required to have,
in each act,

1663
01:06:52,573 --> 01:06:55,054
a major gag and a minor gag.

1664
01:06:55,098 --> 01:06:57,970
So a major gag is one where
you have to show the shark.

1665
01:06:58,014 --> 01:06:59,754
And then a minor gag
would be like, you know,

1666
01:06:59,798 --> 01:07:02,105
a shark POV looking
at someone out of the water

1667
01:07:02,148 --> 01:07:03,280
and then they go, "Aah!"

1668
01:07:03,323 --> 01:07:04,759
And then, like,
blood splashes.

1669
01:07:04,803 --> 01:07:07,066
[laughs]
Just kind of implying it.

1670
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:08,633
- One of the things
for the shark movies,

1671
01:07:08,676 --> 01:07:09,982
certainly
for the low-budget ones,

1672
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:12,071
what you try to do
is keep it, you know,

1673
01:07:12,115 --> 01:07:13,464
we're either underwater

1674
01:07:13,507 --> 01:07:14,943
or they're doing
something crazy

1675
01:07:14,987 --> 01:07:16,293
flying through space.

1676
01:07:16,336 --> 01:07:19,557
So we did shark swimming
through the sand.

1677
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,863
It's like,
well, what else can we do?

1678
01:07:21,907 --> 01:07:23,430
The sand shark was brown.

1679
01:07:23,474 --> 01:07:25,171
And if I just negatived
all the textures,

1680
01:07:25,215 --> 01:07:26,520
it became blue and looked icy.

1681
01:07:26,564 --> 01:07:29,045
And we're like...[gasps]
A shark in the snow!

1682
01:07:29,088 --> 01:07:30,307
- The sort of secret to these--

1683
01:07:30,350 --> 01:07:31,960
like, the, like,
climax moments,

1684
01:07:32,004 --> 01:07:33,527
the action moments
that try to show the shark,

1685
01:07:33,571 --> 01:07:35,964
like, in three different ways.

1686
01:07:36,008 --> 01:07:38,358
And so, like,
underwater it jumps out.

1687
01:07:38,402 --> 01:07:39,707
Over water, slow-mo.

1688
01:07:39,751 --> 01:07:41,796
And then, like, right--
looking from

1689
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,363
where you see it, like,
coming right at her.

1690
01:07:43,407 --> 01:07:44,582
And then, like, cut to a wide,

1691
01:07:44,625 --> 01:07:46,497
and it's, like,
this giant, crazy shark.

1692
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:48,107
And she just shoots it
right in the mouth

1693
01:07:48,151 --> 01:07:49,804
and it flies into the air
and just explodes

1694
01:07:49,848 --> 01:07:51,850
in, like, gore and fireworks.

1695
01:07:51,893 --> 01:07:53,591
And then the whole town claps.

1696
01:07:53,634 --> 01:07:56,115
♪

1697
01:07:56,159 --> 01:07:58,161
- The scene where the shark
comes out of the water--

1698
01:07:58,204 --> 01:07:59,379
that was
in the original script.

1699
01:07:59,423 --> 01:08:00,772
That was always there.

1700
01:08:00,815 --> 01:08:02,643
That was a part, you know,
of the six-headed shark.

1701
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:03,949
Like, what can we do
with the shark,

1702
01:08:03,992 --> 01:08:05,342
you know, that's different,

1703
01:08:05,385 --> 01:08:07,474
that hasn't been done
in the other shark movies?

1704
01:08:07,518 --> 01:08:09,041
Originally, I wanted it
to walk.

1705
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:11,261
Like, I did an animation,
almost like fingers.

1706
01:08:11,304 --> 01:08:13,045
And I think they thought
that was too funny.

1707
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:14,481
You know, it's like a hand.

1708
01:08:14,525 --> 01:08:16,353
And so it's--now it's flat

1709
01:08:16,396 --> 01:08:17,963
and it's kind of,
like, pushing itself.

1710
01:08:18,006 --> 01:08:19,356
It's still hilarious.

1711
01:08:19,399 --> 01:08:20,966
I'm like, what's
the difference, you know?

1712
01:08:21,009 --> 01:08:23,360
- The visual effects
of the sharks came in,

1713
01:08:23,403 --> 01:08:25,362
and they're adorable.

1714
01:08:25,405 --> 01:08:28,234
And they're still in there
as the most adorable things

1715
01:08:28,278 --> 01:08:29,540
you've ever seen.

1716
01:08:29,583 --> 01:08:31,194
I was like, "Okay, well,
it's not gonna be

1717
01:08:31,237 --> 01:08:33,457
the scariest
of all the shark attacks."

1718
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:36,242
- The way it works is,
we don't pitch our buyers,

1719
01:08:36,286 --> 01:08:37,635
really, what we're doing.

1720
01:08:37,678 --> 01:08:39,202
I mean, they tell us
what they want.

1721
01:08:39,245 --> 01:08:42,292
So they're much more in tune
with what the audience wants

1722
01:08:42,335 --> 01:08:44,076
and what they need.

1723
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,730
And so we're just there,

1724
01:08:45,773 --> 01:08:47,558
as any good drug dealer
would be,

1725
01:08:47,601 --> 01:08:49,255
to supply them with the drugs,

1726
01:08:49,299 --> 01:08:50,430
in this case, sharks.

1727
01:08:50,474 --> 01:08:51,997
- And we had pitched
a movie

1728
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,825
that we were calling
"Shark Storm."

1729
01:08:53,868 --> 01:08:55,870
- And they said,

1730
01:08:55,914 --> 01:08:58,482
"Well, interesting
that you sent us that.

1731
01:08:58,525 --> 01:09:02,181
"We actually have
a pitch called 'Sharknado.'

1732
01:09:02,225 --> 01:09:04,575
"And if you can sort of mix
what you're doing,

1733
01:09:04,618 --> 01:09:06,968
"which is sharks
in a tornado, with that,

1734
01:09:07,012 --> 01:09:08,535
let's make
the movie together."

1735
01:09:08,579 --> 01:09:11,973
But finding a director,
it was pass, pass, pass.

1736
01:09:12,017 --> 01:09:13,192
- Look, if I'm gonna make
a movie

1737
01:09:13,236 --> 01:09:14,411
and it's gonna destroy
my career,

1738
01:09:14,454 --> 01:09:16,108
it has to be "Sharknado."

1739
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:18,197
Because I'm just gonna go down
with the flaming sharks

1740
01:09:18,241 --> 01:09:20,156
and make the most insane movie
we can.

1741
01:09:20,199 --> 01:09:21,548
- We put together
all these pieces

1742
01:09:21,592 --> 01:09:23,028
and "Sharknado" starts
coming together.

1743
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:24,203
And it starts being developed.

1744
01:09:24,247 --> 01:09:25,552
- Once we got the tone right,
it's

1745
01:09:25,596 --> 01:09:26,771
how do you do the things

1746
01:09:26,814 --> 01:09:28,816
that are asked of this movie?

1747
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:30,383
I mean, even on--

1748
01:09:30,427 --> 01:09:32,124
it was a little bit bigger
budget than we normally have,

1749
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:34,387
but it's still a film
called "Sharknado."

1750
01:09:34,431 --> 01:09:38,130
And it's a film that floods,
you know, a house.

1751
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:40,741
And there are a lot
of production challenges

1752
01:09:40,785 --> 01:09:42,047
to the film.

1753
01:09:42,090 --> 01:09:43,788
- Because of the limitations,

1754
01:09:43,831 --> 01:09:46,051
there's an energy
of desperation in making it

1755
01:09:46,094 --> 01:09:48,227
where you're using
your limitations

1756
01:09:48,271 --> 01:09:49,315
and what you don't have

1757
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:50,795
or what didn't show up
or the problems.

1758
01:09:50,838 --> 01:09:52,405
And you're just going,
"Okay, let's do this

1759
01:09:52,449 --> 01:09:54,059
and let's do that."

1760
01:09:54,102 --> 01:09:55,234
And so instead of being
so precise

1761
01:09:55,278 --> 01:09:57,236
and, you know, animatic-ed out
to death

1762
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:58,933
and, you know, everything
is so precise,

1763
01:09:58,977 --> 01:10:01,632
it just has
this energy of the moment.

1764
01:10:01,675 --> 01:10:05,766
- It's, you know, cut
to this stock shot,

1765
01:10:05,810 --> 01:10:07,594
then an actual shot
from the movie,

1766
01:10:07,638 --> 01:10:09,248
and then the visual effect.

1767
01:10:09,292 --> 01:10:13,687
And really was massaged over
time to somehow be coherent.

1768
01:10:13,731 --> 01:10:16,516
- The whole movie is just,
you know,

1769
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,431
messed up and crazy and wild.

1770
01:10:18,475 --> 01:10:21,173
And it just doesn't stop,
from the beginning to end.

1771
01:10:23,741 --> 01:10:27,353
- "Sharknado" really
checks all the boxes,

1772
01:10:27,397 --> 01:10:30,965
I think, not just for
the network requirements

1773
01:10:31,009 --> 01:10:33,620
and for, like, the genre,
but, like, for the audience.

1774
01:10:33,664 --> 01:10:37,581
You know, it's just always
delivering on what you--

1775
01:10:37,624 --> 01:10:38,843
on what you expect

1776
01:10:38,886 --> 01:10:41,759
out of something
called "Sharknado."

1777
01:10:41,802 --> 01:10:45,284
- I remember watching
the film for the first time,

1778
01:10:45,328 --> 01:10:47,025
like all together,
before anybody else

1779
01:10:47,068 --> 01:10:49,070
was gonna see it,
just to see if it was working.

1780
01:10:49,114 --> 01:10:51,377
And after it was over,
it was like,

1781
01:10:51,421 --> 01:10:53,988
we were laughing and making fun
of it and all that stuff.

1782
01:10:54,032 --> 01:10:56,600
And at the end, I go,
"This is the most insane movie,

1783
01:10:56,643 --> 01:10:58,776
I think, that's ever gonna air
on Syfy."

1784
01:10:58,819 --> 01:11:00,299
- We had no expectations

1785
01:11:00,343 --> 01:11:02,997
because, quite frankly,

1786
01:11:03,041 --> 01:11:06,566
we'd made "Sharknado"
a dozen times before this.

1787
01:11:06,610 --> 01:11:07,698
- We were doing, you know,

1788
01:11:07,741 --> 01:11:09,177
two or three of these movies
a month.

1789
01:11:09,221 --> 01:11:11,179
So you never know which ones
are going to take off

1790
01:11:11,223 --> 01:11:12,746
and which ones aren't.

1791
01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:14,879
And the whole Twitter thing
was kind of new at the time.

1792
01:11:14,922 --> 01:11:16,663
It wasn't brand new,
but it was kind of new.

1793
01:11:16,707 --> 01:11:20,928
And I remember I was at home,
watching the movie

1794
01:11:20,972 --> 01:11:22,887
with my wife and kids.

1795
01:11:22,930 --> 01:11:25,324
And all of a sudden,
I get a text

1796
01:11:25,368 --> 01:11:27,674
from someone at work saying,
"Go to Twitter right now.

1797
01:11:27,718 --> 01:11:28,719
Go to Twitter."

1798
01:11:28,762 --> 01:11:32,288
- I did look at Twitter,
you know,

1799
01:11:32,331 --> 01:11:34,202
the night that it premiered.

1800
01:11:34,246 --> 01:11:35,856
And it just goes on and on.

1801
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:37,336
And it just keeps refreshing.

1802
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:39,947
And the feed just--
I can't keep up with it.

1803
01:11:39,991 --> 01:11:41,993
- A couple of celebrities
and comedians

1804
01:11:42,036 --> 01:11:43,951
did the first couple
of tweets about it.

1805
01:11:43,995 --> 01:11:45,736
And they had
a lot of followers.

1806
01:11:45,779 --> 01:11:48,521
And then the snowball
just started rolling.

1807
01:11:48,565 --> 01:11:50,697
- And I remember going to bed
that night,

1808
01:11:50,741 --> 01:11:55,049
probably about two hours later,
thinking our lives

1809
01:11:55,093 --> 01:11:56,616
have changed.

1810
01:11:56,660 --> 01:11:58,488
- And then this juggernaut
of "Sharknado"

1811
01:11:58,531 --> 01:12:00,533
just like plowed
through everything.

1812
01:12:00,577 --> 01:12:01,665
- "Sharknado."

1813
01:12:01,708 --> 01:12:03,493
- It's called "Sharknado."

1814
01:12:03,536 --> 01:12:05,146
- There's a Sharknado warning.

1815
01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:07,671
- At its peak, more
than 5,000 #Sharknado.

1816
01:12:07,714 --> 01:12:11,849
- "Sharknado" caught
kind of a wave

1817
01:12:11,892 --> 01:12:13,459
on the Internet

1818
01:12:13,503 --> 01:12:15,853
of people who were praising it

1819
01:12:15,896 --> 01:12:18,290
and also people
who were laughing at it.

1820
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:22,163
And it's the old statement,
any publicity is good,

1821
01:12:22,207 --> 01:12:24,818
whether they praise
your picture or not.

1822
01:12:24,862 --> 01:12:28,126
- We could have done this
a thousand different ways,

1823
01:12:28,169 --> 01:12:29,736
and the outcome would have been

1824
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:32,086
a thousand different,
you know, outcomes.

1825
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:35,481
The fact that, as I've said,
no plane crashes happened

1826
01:12:35,525 --> 01:12:37,744
on that day
when it was released

1827
01:12:37,788 --> 01:12:39,616
made us a little bit
more newsworthy.

1828
01:12:39,659 --> 01:12:41,792
But why we were newsworthy
the next day,

1829
01:12:41,835 --> 01:12:43,402
and the next day,
and the next day?

1830
01:12:43,446 --> 01:12:45,883
I mean, literally,
it was a news story

1831
01:12:45,926 --> 01:12:49,190
for a week on local press
and national press.

1832
01:12:49,234 --> 01:12:56,023
It defied logic
and expectation, certainly,

1833
01:12:56,067 --> 01:13:01,420
the success and how it was
received and how it was loved.

1834
01:13:01,464 --> 01:13:03,422
- It was a great feeling
that we did

1835
01:13:03,466 --> 01:13:06,382
this little, tiny film
that the fans discovered

1836
01:13:06,425 --> 01:13:07,818
and it became what it was.

1837
01:13:07,861 --> 01:13:11,474
- For Sharknado, tons
of, like, sharky nerd people

1838
01:13:11,517 --> 01:13:13,780
like me that are
also actually scientists,

1839
01:13:13,824 --> 01:13:16,435
they low-key did data
on "Sharknado"

1840
01:13:16,479 --> 01:13:17,741
and then they're,
like, putting up

1841
01:13:17,784 --> 01:13:20,308
on different social media
platforms

1842
01:13:20,352 --> 01:13:22,180
you know, like Twitter,
Facebook,

1843
01:13:22,223 --> 01:13:25,836
of, like, a graph that
they did from "Sharknado."

1844
01:13:25,879 --> 01:13:30,014
It got people like me
who just love bad movies

1845
01:13:30,057 --> 01:13:32,930
like, a little bit further
down the rabbit hole

1846
01:13:32,973 --> 01:13:34,366
of the actual science.

1847
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:37,108
Because that's--you know,

1848
01:13:37,151 --> 01:13:39,284
like, social media is where
both of these people

1849
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:40,851
find each other.

1850
01:13:40,894 --> 01:13:42,461
- I think
that's the beauty of it.

1851
01:13:42,505 --> 01:13:43,767
We got to make something.

1852
01:13:43,810 --> 01:13:45,203
They trusted me,

1853
01:13:45,246 --> 01:13:46,596
even though
I was absolutely insane,

1854
01:13:46,639 --> 01:13:48,467
making an insane little film.

1855
01:13:48,511 --> 01:13:50,338
And they gave me a lot of rope
to hang myself with.

1856
01:13:50,382 --> 01:13:52,384
And we ended up
with a movie

1857
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:55,082
that somehow spawned
six films.

1858
01:13:55,126 --> 01:13:57,563
And it's its own
little unique universe.

1859
01:13:59,086 --> 01:14:00,827
- After "Sharknado,"
nobody looked back.

1860
01:14:00,871 --> 01:14:03,221
You see the shark movies
just popping out

1861
01:14:03,264 --> 01:14:05,571
with more
and more stupid movies,

1862
01:14:05,615 --> 01:14:08,182
more and more lousy CGI--

1863
01:14:08,226 --> 01:14:10,489
quick made movies,
but fun movies.

1864
01:14:10,533 --> 01:14:12,926
- The sharksploitation genre,
budget-wise,

1865
01:14:12,970 --> 01:14:14,667
really breaks down
into three tiers.

1866
01:14:14,711 --> 01:14:17,583
You have the studio-level
sharksploitation movies.

1867
01:14:17,627 --> 01:14:19,193
Then you have the second tier,

1868
01:14:19,237 --> 01:14:21,631
which are like the Syfy Channel
Original movies.

1869
01:14:21,674 --> 01:14:25,896
But then, below that, you have
the micro-budget tier,

1870
01:14:25,939 --> 01:14:29,639
which consists of movies
like "Sharkula"

1871
01:14:29,682 --> 01:14:31,858
or "Sharkenstein."

1872
01:14:31,902 --> 01:14:35,035
Oh, and let's not forget
"Ouija Shark."

1873
01:14:35,079 --> 01:14:36,384
- Mystic shield.

1874
01:14:36,428 --> 01:14:40,954
- You're taking
the shark sort of milieu,

1875
01:14:40,998 --> 01:14:45,742
and you're adding a lot
of extravagant things to it,

1876
01:14:45,785 --> 01:14:49,354
idea-wise--sharks that fly,
sharks that can be on land.

1877
01:14:49,397 --> 01:14:53,706
You really can throw
any genre or trapping at it

1878
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:57,667
and kind of expand upon just
the shark being in the water.

1879
01:14:57,710 --> 01:15:01,322
- I can watch
a bad shark movie with a joy.

1880
01:15:01,366 --> 01:15:05,196
If I can feel the heartbeat
behind the director,

1881
01:15:05,239 --> 01:15:07,938
then it doesn't matter
that the effects are poor

1882
01:15:07,981 --> 01:15:12,159
or that the extras can't act,
or that light is not right,

1883
01:15:12,203 --> 01:15:14,118
and the CGI is crappy.

1884
01:15:14,161 --> 01:15:18,949
But if you take heart
into it, I actually like it.

1885
01:15:18,992 --> 01:15:21,734
- Some of the shark movies
that I've directed

1886
01:15:21,778 --> 01:15:23,867
would be "Sharkenstein,"

1887
01:15:23,910 --> 01:15:26,434
"Land Shark,"
"Amityville Island,"

1888
01:15:26,478 --> 01:15:28,611
"Shark Encounters
of the Third Kind,"

1889
01:15:28,654 --> 01:15:31,004
"Virus Shark," "Noah's Shark,"

1890
01:15:31,048 --> 01:15:32,745
"Jurassic Shark 2"
and "3,"

1891
01:15:32,789 --> 01:15:37,533
"Sharkula," and "Doll Shark,"
just to name a few.

1892
01:15:39,491 --> 01:15:42,407
- We had had a great mix
of everything.

1893
01:15:42,450 --> 01:15:44,931
We had had the Jawsploitation.

1894
01:15:44,975 --> 01:15:46,846
We'd had the sci-fi films.

1895
01:15:46,890 --> 01:15:48,544
We'd had everything
in between.

1896
01:15:48,587 --> 01:15:52,069
And then you have
the more realistic,

1897
01:15:52,112 --> 01:15:54,985
if you were actually
scuba diving and left

1898
01:15:55,028 --> 01:15:59,163
or you're a swimmer who's
stranded for whatever reason.

1899
01:15:59,206 --> 01:16:00,468
- There's one
called "The Reef,"

1900
01:16:00,512 --> 01:16:02,079
which was done by a filmmaker

1901
01:16:02,122 --> 01:16:03,602
named Andrew Traucki,

1902
01:16:03,646 --> 01:16:06,344
who had done "Black Water,"
where he had composited.

1903
01:16:06,387 --> 01:16:08,912
Instead of doing
digitally created crocodiles,

1904
01:16:08,955 --> 01:16:11,871
he shot the real thing
and just digitally composited

1905
01:16:11,915 --> 01:16:12,872
them in with the actors.

1906
01:16:12,916 --> 01:16:14,047
And it was really effective.

1907
01:16:14,091 --> 01:16:16,049
So the obvious next step
was to do that

1908
01:16:16,093 --> 01:16:17,442
with the great white shark.

1909
01:16:17,485 --> 01:16:19,139
And it's
a really solid little film.

1910
01:16:19,183 --> 01:16:21,838
- In both "The Reef"
and "The Reef: Stalked,"

1911
01:16:21,881 --> 01:16:23,883
I've used, as much
as possible, real sharks.

1912
01:16:23,927 --> 01:16:25,885
I think it really pays off
in spades

1913
01:16:25,929 --> 01:16:29,149
in terms of your belief
in the situation.

1914
01:16:29,193 --> 01:16:31,369
So that's my approach.
It's all about suspense.

1915
01:16:31,412 --> 01:16:33,501
And, you know, a lot of that
in a shark film is,

1916
01:16:33,545 --> 01:16:35,286
where is that fin?

1917
01:16:35,329 --> 01:16:38,028
Like, you know, you show
that fin and then it's gone.

1918
01:16:38,071 --> 01:16:39,464
And that, to me,
is a lot scarier

1919
01:16:39,507 --> 01:16:42,206
than constantly seeing
the shark and CGI sharks

1920
01:16:42,249 --> 01:16:43,816
and all that sort of stuff.

1921
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:46,645
- I just liked what he did
with such little.

1922
01:16:46,689 --> 01:16:49,082
The way that he played
the tension of the shark

1923
01:16:49,126 --> 01:16:50,910
and then not
really seeing the shark,

1924
01:16:50,954 --> 01:16:52,259
I just really bought it.

1925
01:16:52,303 --> 01:16:53,304
You know, 'cause I bought
the shark

1926
01:16:53,347 --> 01:16:54,653
and I bought the tension.

1927
01:16:54,697 --> 01:16:57,656
And so that one
really kind of affected me.

1928
01:16:57,700 --> 01:16:59,615
- "The Reef" was based
on a true story.

1929
01:16:59,658 --> 01:17:02,530
It happened in Australia
in the '80s,

1930
01:17:02,574 --> 01:17:04,315
about a boat that went down.

1931
01:17:04,358 --> 01:17:06,273
And in my version,
it's about four friends

1932
01:17:06,317 --> 01:17:09,059
who--they're gonna deliver
a boat to Indonesia

1933
01:17:09,102 --> 01:17:10,669
and, unfortunately,
hit a piece of reef,

1934
01:17:10,713 --> 01:17:12,149
and the boat sinks.

1935
01:17:12,192 --> 01:17:13,846
And then they're left
with this terrible dilemma

1936
01:17:13,890 --> 01:17:16,457
as to whether they're gonna
stay on the sinking boat

1937
01:17:16,501 --> 01:17:17,937
or swim for land.

1938
01:17:17,981 --> 01:17:20,636
And some of them decide
to swim,

1939
01:17:20,679 --> 01:17:22,942
and one of them decides
to stay on the boat.

1940
01:17:22,986 --> 01:17:27,251
And yeah, so unfortunately,
those that decided to swim,

1941
01:17:27,294 --> 01:17:29,819
a big shark starts
to come after them

1942
01:17:29,862 --> 01:17:32,473
and picks them off one by one.

1943
01:17:34,562 --> 01:17:35,651
When you're writing something,

1944
01:17:35,694 --> 01:17:37,783
you're always looking
at references

1945
01:17:37,827 --> 01:17:40,003
and drawing off things
to get inspiration.

1946
01:17:40,046 --> 01:17:43,789
I think a great inspiration
for this, both my--

1947
01:17:43,833 --> 01:17:45,530
really in my entire style
of working,

1948
01:17:45,573 --> 01:17:47,010
has been "Open Water,"
in the sense

1949
01:17:47,053 --> 01:17:49,708
that it's very real
but it also was low-budget

1950
01:17:49,752 --> 01:17:51,231
and could be done.

1951
01:17:51,275 --> 01:17:53,712
- "Open Water" is probably
the best shark movie

1952
01:17:53,756 --> 01:17:55,975
to come out, you know,
maybe since "Jaws."

1953
01:17:56,019 --> 01:17:58,108
You know, and it took
a whole different approach.

1954
01:17:58,151 --> 01:17:59,631
We were kind of into the whole

1955
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:02,242
"Blair Witch" era of sort of--

1956
01:18:02,286 --> 01:18:04,854
I hate to use this term, but
kind of handmade horror films,

1957
01:18:04,897 --> 01:18:06,246
which sounds negative.

1958
01:18:06,290 --> 01:18:07,857
But it's like
people just going out

1959
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:09,902
with, like,
a camera and a few actors

1960
01:18:09,946 --> 01:18:11,208
and taking advantage

1961
01:18:11,251 --> 01:18:13,471
of, you know,
the new opportunities

1962
01:18:13,514 --> 01:18:15,299
that digital filmmaking
allowed

1963
01:18:15,342 --> 01:18:16,953
and not having a big crew

1964
01:18:16,996 --> 01:18:19,433
and just going out there
and making a little movie

1965
01:18:19,477 --> 01:18:21,348
in kind of
a hostile environment.

1966
01:18:21,392 --> 01:18:22,915
Instead of the woods
for "Blair Witch,"

1967
01:18:22,959 --> 01:18:25,744
you take these characters
out into the open ocean.

1968
01:18:25,788 --> 01:18:27,137
- I'd been a diver
for a long time.

1969
01:18:27,180 --> 01:18:29,400
I love diving with sharks
and all these things.

1970
01:18:29,443 --> 01:18:32,882
And I got newsletters
from dive magazines.

1971
01:18:32,925 --> 01:18:36,320
And a story had come out about
a couple that were left at sea

1972
01:18:36,363 --> 01:18:38,235
in Australia
off the Great Barrier Reef,

1973
01:18:38,278 --> 01:18:39,758
that they had gone off
on one of these

1974
01:18:39,802 --> 01:18:41,107
what we call cattle boats,

1975
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:42,935
because there's, like,
100 people.

1976
01:18:42,979 --> 01:18:43,936
And they take them out
in the reef,

1977
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:45,068
and everyone goes in,

1978
01:18:45,111 --> 01:18:46,634
and they do the head count.

1979
01:18:46,678 --> 01:18:48,593
And these people--they missed
them on the head count.

1980
01:18:48,636 --> 01:18:51,117
And the boat left them
in the middle of the ocean.

1981
01:18:51,161 --> 01:18:54,860
To me, was the most horrifying
thing that could happen.

1982
01:18:54,904 --> 01:18:57,428
What hit me emotionally was,
it could happen to me.

1983
01:18:57,471 --> 01:18:58,864
Like, what was that like?

1984
01:18:58,908 --> 01:19:00,910
Like, oh, my--
it just taunted me.

1985
01:19:00,953 --> 01:19:02,433
Like, it could keep me up.

1986
01:19:02,476 --> 01:19:04,435
And like, oh, my God,
how could that happen?

1987
01:19:04,478 --> 01:19:05,871
Just when you go on vacation,

1988
01:19:05,915 --> 01:19:07,743
you just assume
you're gonna be okay,

1989
01:19:07,786 --> 01:19:09,657
especially in
a situation like that.

1990
01:19:09,701 --> 01:19:12,573
This is not extreme--
some kind of extreme sport.

1991
01:19:12,617 --> 01:19:16,360
It's the most tourist level
of diving there is.

1992
01:19:16,403 --> 01:19:19,232
So aesthetically,
we wanted it to look

1993
01:19:19,276 --> 01:19:22,279
just like how people film
their vacations.

1994
01:19:22,322 --> 01:19:26,936
Because the secret to the film
was--working, in my mind,

1995
01:19:26,979 --> 01:19:28,720
was all about point of view.

1996
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:30,853
It was all about putting
the audience right there

1997
01:19:30,896 --> 01:19:32,680
and knowing
what that experience was

1998
01:19:32,724 --> 01:19:34,857
and limiting
what they can see and do

1999
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:37,468
to what
the two lead characters

2000
01:19:37,511 --> 01:19:38,556
could see and do.

2001
01:19:40,079 --> 01:19:42,690
- The realism of that movie
is what is so terrifying.

2002
01:19:42,734 --> 01:19:44,301
Because you don't start
the movie

2003
01:19:44,344 --> 01:19:45,389
being scared of sharks.

2004
01:19:45,432 --> 01:19:46,651
I mean, these people have been

2005
01:19:46,694 --> 01:19:48,087
scuba diving in this
at this point.

2006
01:19:48,131 --> 01:19:49,785
You know that
there are sharks there,

2007
01:19:49,828 --> 01:19:51,351
but that they're not doing
anything.

2008
01:19:51,395 --> 01:19:52,831
And it's not until
these people

2009
01:19:52,875 --> 01:19:54,093
have been just bobbing

2010
01:19:54,137 --> 01:19:55,878
in the water for hours
that the sharks

2011
01:19:55,921 --> 01:19:58,445
start getting curious,
where they're bumping them.

2012
01:19:58,489 --> 01:20:00,273
And then you just see them
swimming by.

2013
01:20:00,317 --> 01:20:03,755
And it's a more
real-to-life progression

2014
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:06,323
of how a shark
would actually explore

2015
01:20:06,366 --> 01:20:08,978
to decide if you are food
or not.

2016
01:20:09,021 --> 01:20:11,589
- And of course, the fact
that the sharks are real--

2017
01:20:11,632 --> 01:20:13,983
that just adds to the whole
terror of the experience

2018
01:20:14,026 --> 01:20:15,288
of watching that film.

2019
01:20:15,332 --> 01:20:17,247
- In every movie,
you see sharks underwater.

2020
01:20:17,290 --> 01:20:18,639
And they're not--

2021
01:20:18,683 --> 01:20:20,163
I never found them scary
underwater.

2022
01:20:20,206 --> 01:20:22,078
And actually diving with them,
they're not.

2023
01:20:22,121 --> 01:20:23,557
You know, it's amazing.

2024
01:20:23,601 --> 01:20:25,429
Of course, I'm a person
who chooses to do that.

2025
01:20:25,472 --> 01:20:28,258
But after the dive,
on the surface,

2026
01:20:28,301 --> 01:20:31,652
what's disconcerting is
the tail flapping by or a fin.

2027
01:20:31,696 --> 01:20:34,830
And so I wanted
to capture that,

2028
01:20:34,873 --> 01:20:36,222
which is something
I'd never seen before,

2029
01:20:36,266 --> 01:20:37,963
which is actually
how you'd experience it

2030
01:20:38,007 --> 01:20:39,443
if you were in the middle
of the ocean

2031
01:20:39,486 --> 01:20:42,185
and sharks decided to gather
and check you out.

2032
01:20:42,228 --> 01:20:45,275
So it was all these factors
that came together.

2033
01:20:45,318 --> 01:20:47,581
And we said
this feels like a good--

2034
01:20:47,625 --> 01:20:49,235
this feels like a good
combination of things

2035
01:20:49,279 --> 01:20:52,717
to do something we think
could be kind of different.

back up
into mainstream movies.

2041
01:21:06,687 --> 01:21:08,689
And eventually,
we work our way into things

2042
01:21:08,733 --> 01:21:11,910
like "47 Meters Down"
and "The Shallows"

2043
01:21:11,954 --> 01:21:13,564
and even films like "Crawl,"

2044
01:21:13,607 --> 01:21:16,393
where suddenly
nature attack films

2045
01:21:16,436 --> 01:21:18,699
are kind of shifted
back into theaters.

2046
01:21:18,743 --> 01:21:22,529
And we see sharks existing
both in A-market

2047
01:21:22,573 --> 01:21:26,142
and in B-market
simultaneously.

2048
01:21:26,185 --> 01:21:28,753
- I was sharing an apartment
with the producer.

2049
01:21:28,796 --> 01:21:30,798
And I told him
I wanted to do a shark movie.

2050
01:21:30,842 --> 01:21:32,626
And I was like,
"I have not seen

2051
01:21:32,670 --> 01:21:33,976
a good shark movie for ages."

2052
01:21:34,019 --> 01:21:36,195
You know, forever,
apart from "Jaws."

2053
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:39,068
You know,
the pitch was so sharp.

2054
01:21:39,111 --> 01:21:41,766
It was like, you know--
it was actually, at the time,

2055
01:21:41,809 --> 01:21:43,115
the pitch was four people
at the bottom

2056
01:21:43,159 --> 01:21:44,682
of the ocean trying to get up.

2057
01:21:44,725 --> 01:21:46,292
And people were like,
this is great.

2058
01:21:46,336 --> 01:21:48,686
And I'm just like, this is,
you know, the easiest thing

2059
01:21:48,729 --> 01:21:49,861
I'm ever gonna write.

2060
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:54,126
I wrote it,
and it just felt like--

2061
01:21:54,170 --> 01:21:55,388
you know, it felt like sort of

2062
01:21:55,432 --> 01:21:56,912
"I Know What You Did
Last Summer,"

2063
01:21:56,955 --> 01:21:58,304
but at the bottom of the ocean.

2064
01:21:58,348 --> 01:22:00,480
It just felt like, "Oh, God,
this is just awful."

2065
01:22:00,524 --> 01:22:01,960
And then I was sitting

2066
01:22:02,004 --> 01:22:03,788
with my script writing
partner, Ernest.

2067
01:22:03,831 --> 01:22:05,268
And we watched
"Touching the Void."

2068
01:22:05,311 --> 01:22:06,965
And I was just like,
"Holy shit,

2069
01:22:07,009 --> 01:22:08,532
that's what this movie
needs to be."

2070
01:22:08,575 --> 01:22:10,534
You know, there's that moment
in "Touching the Void"

2071
01:22:10,577 --> 01:22:12,536
where the guy is down
the crevasse

2072
01:22:12,579 --> 01:22:14,407
and he can see above
and he can't get to it.

2073
01:22:14,451 --> 01:22:18,934
So his decision-making process
was, "I can't get up to it,

2074
01:22:18,977 --> 01:22:22,676
so what I'll do is, I'll go
further down into this abyss."

2075
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:24,591
And I was like,
what kind of fucking mentality

2076
01:22:24,635 --> 01:22:26,028
is happening?

2077
01:22:26,071 --> 01:22:28,726
I mean, that saved his life,
but I could not imagine

2078
01:22:28,769 --> 01:22:32,034
any moment in my life that
I would leave the light

2079
01:22:32,077 --> 01:22:35,820
to go further into a--
into, like, a crevasse.

2080
01:22:35,863 --> 01:22:37,343
And I was just obsessed

2081
01:22:37,387 --> 01:22:40,129
with these two
crazy characters.

2082
01:22:40,172 --> 01:22:44,394
And so that was where
"47" then sprung from.

2083
01:22:44,437 --> 01:22:47,832
- It was very, like,
uncharted territory.

2084
01:22:47,875 --> 01:22:52,880
And it was this motley crew
in this very small,

2085
01:22:52,924 --> 01:22:56,362
quite affordable
underwater stage in England--

2086
01:22:56,406 --> 01:22:57,755
not one of the big ones.

2087
01:22:57,798 --> 01:23:01,280
And it was like
pirates making a movie.

2088
01:23:01,324 --> 01:23:02,934
We were just learning
as we went.

2089
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:06,938
And Johannes did a great job,
but I know it's like,

2090
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:08,461
every day,
there'd be a new, like,

2091
01:23:08,505 --> 01:23:10,420
"Oh, you can only be underwater
for four hours"

2092
01:23:10,463 --> 01:23:13,597
and all this stuff
that you just didn't expect

2093
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:14,902
or didn't know about.

2094
01:23:14,946 --> 01:23:17,557
- You know, I'm a diver,
and I wanted it to look

2095
01:23:17,601 --> 01:23:19,081
real, rather than the tank.

2096
01:23:19,124 --> 01:23:22,998
So we--I think we did what
nobody else has done before.

2097
01:23:23,041 --> 01:23:26,653
We had trucks of broccoli
coming in every day.

2098
01:23:26,697 --> 01:23:28,481
And the interns would be
mincing up the broccoli,

2099
01:23:28,525 --> 01:23:31,832
and we'd have special divers
putting out the broccoli

2100
01:23:31,876 --> 01:23:33,138
before we were filming

2101
01:23:33,182 --> 01:23:34,748
so the light catches
the broccoli.

2102
01:23:34,792 --> 01:23:36,794
And even in a small tank,
you have a current.

2103
01:23:36,837 --> 01:23:38,926
And you see the sediment
sort of flow

2104
01:23:38,970 --> 01:23:40,276
backwards and forwards.

2105
01:23:40,319 --> 01:23:42,626
And it gives it
a completely different look,

2106
01:23:42,669 --> 01:23:43,844
that unique look.

2107
01:23:43,888 --> 01:23:45,411
And then we put
milk in the tank

2108
01:23:45,455 --> 01:23:47,413
so it really felt
like when I go diving.

2109
01:23:47,457 --> 01:23:48,501
It really felt like that.

2110
01:23:48,545 --> 01:23:49,763
But the problem was,

2111
01:23:49,807 --> 01:23:51,243
it was the hottest summer

2112
01:23:51,287 --> 01:23:53,202
we had ever had in England.

2113
01:23:53,245 --> 01:23:54,594
It was like
a super hot summer.

2114
01:23:54,638 --> 01:23:56,683
- And the sun was just beaming
down on us

2115
01:23:56,727 --> 01:23:57,989
inside this tank,

2116
01:23:58,033 --> 01:23:59,512
because it was
like a canvas tank

2117
01:23:59,556 --> 01:24:02,167
as opposed to, like,
a brick or cement tank.

2118
01:24:02,211 --> 01:24:04,343
And so we're just
getting cooked.

2119
01:24:04,387 --> 01:24:05,866
- You've got broccoli.

2120
01:24:05,910 --> 01:24:07,651
You've got milk.

2121
01:24:07,694 --> 01:24:10,088
You've got--when you
shoot in the tank,

2122
01:24:10,132 --> 01:24:11,524
nobody goes to the loo.

2123
01:24:11,568 --> 01:24:13,135
So you've got urine,
you've got broccoli,

2124
01:24:13,178 --> 01:24:16,268
you've got milk all rotting
under this incredible heat.

2125
01:24:16,312 --> 01:24:18,662
I remember it clear as a day,

2126
01:24:18,705 --> 01:24:22,579
standing there
on the side of the tank.

2127
01:24:22,622 --> 01:24:25,103
And I just remember thinking,
"I don't know

2128
01:24:25,147 --> 01:24:26,974
how to make this cage drop."

2129
01:24:27,018 --> 01:24:29,499
Everything moves
fucking slowly under water.

2130
01:24:29,542 --> 01:24:32,110
Not just to get stuff
to happen, but when it does.

2131
01:24:32,154 --> 01:24:34,634
Like the cage was--you know,
I wanted it to do that.

2132
01:24:34,678 --> 01:24:36,897
And it's like, like that.

2133
01:24:36,941 --> 01:24:39,552
And basically,
we just had it go

2134
01:24:39,596 --> 01:24:40,901
as fast as it could one way,

2135
01:24:40,945 --> 01:24:42,120
the girls go the other,

2136
01:24:42,164 --> 01:24:43,730
and then the camera go
another.

2137
01:24:43,774 --> 01:24:46,646
And it just looks tumbling.

2138
01:24:48,387 --> 01:24:50,694
I think we're now in a world--

2139
01:24:50,737 --> 01:24:52,826
like, I love the sharks
in "47."

2140
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:55,177
Like, that shot where
it comes out at the end

2141
01:24:55,220 --> 01:24:57,744
and grabs her foot--I remember
when they delivered that.

2142
01:24:57,788 --> 01:24:59,833
I was like, "Holy fuck.
This is--this is really"--

2143
01:24:59,877 --> 01:25:02,097
there's, like,
two or three shots in there

2144
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:06,013
where I'm like,
"Wow, that's--that's like--

2145
01:25:06,057 --> 01:25:07,145
I can touch that."

2146
01:25:07,189 --> 01:25:09,539
That's pretty impressive.

2147
01:25:09,582 --> 01:25:11,193
- And then you had
"The Shallows,"

2148
01:25:11,236 --> 01:25:13,804
which was a similar kind of
thing done on a bigger budget.

2149
01:25:13,847 --> 01:25:16,023
But again, it's like
a survival thing.

2150
01:25:16,067 --> 01:25:18,287
You know, one young woman
stuck in the sea.

2151
01:25:18,330 --> 01:25:20,289
It's a great premise.
She's stuck on a rock,

2152
01:25:20,332 --> 01:25:21,855
and the beach is
right over there,

2153
01:25:21,899 --> 01:25:24,641
but there's a big shark
kind of circling around

2154
01:25:24,684 --> 01:25:26,338
that's gonna make
that impossible.

2155
01:25:26,382 --> 01:25:27,818
And that was
another really fun one.

2156
01:25:27,861 --> 01:25:30,299
- There's something
really terrifying

2157
01:25:30,342 --> 01:25:34,651
about the idea of being trapped
on a buoy with nowhere to go.

2158
01:25:34,694 --> 01:25:36,218
And the tide comes in,
and you know

2159
01:25:36,261 --> 01:25:38,220
there's a 30-foot shark

2160
01:25:38,263 --> 01:25:40,265
lurking around underneath you,

2161
01:25:40,309 --> 01:25:42,093
ready to just tear you
to pieces.

2162
01:25:42,137 --> 01:25:44,704
- When you watch that film,
it's a great movie.

2163
01:25:44,748 --> 01:25:47,838
But the concept--you gotta give
credit to the filmmakers

2164
01:25:47,881 --> 01:25:48,882
and the actress.

2165
01:25:48,926 --> 01:25:50,841
Because once that film starts,

2166
01:25:50,884 --> 01:25:52,712
it literally is just her.

2167
01:25:52,756 --> 01:25:55,498
And that's--I mean, for her
to carry that whole movie,

2168
01:25:55,541 --> 01:25:57,413
hold that tension
for that long,

2169
01:25:57,456 --> 01:26:00,851
was pretty impressive.

2170
01:26:00,894 --> 01:26:02,679
- "47 Meters Down"
and "The Shallows"

2171
01:26:02,722 --> 01:26:05,812
were really successful
studio-level pictures.

2172
01:26:05,856 --> 01:26:07,205
But they were
studio-level pictures

2173
01:26:07,249 --> 01:26:09,076
made on a pretty modest budget.

2174
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:11,035
So the natural progression
of that,

2175
01:26:11,078 --> 01:26:13,211
because they were
so successful,

2176
01:26:13,255 --> 01:26:15,866
it just made sense
to make things even bigger.

2177
01:26:15,909 --> 01:26:17,259
And along comes "The Meg."

2178
01:26:17,302 --> 01:26:21,741
- A type of shark stronger
inside the shark movies

2179
01:26:21,785 --> 01:26:24,657
is the way you see the shark
not as a normal shark,

2180
01:26:24,701 --> 01:26:26,398
but as a prehistoric shark.

2181
01:26:26,442 --> 01:26:28,487
A big shark, like a megalodon.

2182
01:26:28,531 --> 01:26:30,707
- The megalodon was
the largest shark

2183
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:32,926
that ever existed.

2184
01:26:32,970 --> 01:26:34,145
It feared nothing.

2185
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:35,364
- The most well-known,
of course,

2186
01:26:35,407 --> 01:26:37,235
is the movie called "The Meg"

2187
01:26:37,279 --> 01:26:39,629
with Jason Statham
in the lead role,

2188
01:26:39,672 --> 01:26:42,022
where you see a submarine
going through

2189
01:26:42,066 --> 01:26:45,200
the bottom of the sea
and releasing a big shark.

2190
01:26:45,243 --> 01:26:47,898
It's coming back to the human

2191
01:26:47,941 --> 01:26:50,422
and actually eating everything
on its way.

2192
01:26:50,466 --> 01:26:52,163
- It goes back to this idea

2193
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:54,513
that we want to believe
in the supernatural

2194
01:26:54,557 --> 01:26:56,080
and the mysterious.

2195
01:26:56,123 --> 01:26:57,777
I think that,
especially as technology

2196
01:26:57,821 --> 01:26:59,692
and science advances,

2197
01:26:59,736 --> 01:27:02,434
we lose a little bit
of the mystery,

2198
01:27:02,478 --> 01:27:04,436
or we think that we lose
some of the mystery

2199
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:05,655
that exists in our world.

2200
01:27:05,698 --> 01:27:08,484
And the idea
that someone is out there

2201
01:27:08,527 --> 01:27:10,747
who could discover
this thousands-of-year-old

2202
01:27:10,790 --> 01:27:13,793
giant megalodon
or prehistoric creature

2203
01:27:13,837 --> 01:27:16,056
is really attractive,
not only because it allows us

2204
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:18,407
to stake our claim
over part of the environment

2205
01:27:18,450 --> 01:27:21,279
we might not understand,
but because it allows us

2206
01:27:21,323 --> 01:27:23,325
to keep that imagination alive.

2207
01:27:23,368 --> 01:27:25,979
- I knew that there was
such a thing as the megalodon.

2208
01:27:26,023 --> 01:27:27,633
I looked it up online.

2209
01:27:27,677 --> 01:27:32,508
And I saw families of people
standing inside these jaws.

2210
01:27:32,551 --> 01:27:35,293
These were huge
fucking real sharks

2211
01:27:35,337 --> 01:27:36,555
from back in the day.

2212
01:27:36,599 --> 01:27:39,602
- What were they saying,
six fully-grown men

2213
01:27:39,645 --> 01:27:41,821
could be swallowed
by the megalodon?

2214
01:27:41,865 --> 01:27:43,649
I mean, that's
a pretty giant mouth.

2215
01:27:43,693 --> 01:27:45,172
[laughs]

2216
01:27:45,216 --> 01:27:47,436
- Is that megalodon
out there in the sea?

2217
01:27:47,479 --> 01:27:50,221
You know, 80% of the sea
hasn't been explored.

2218
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:53,268
And every day, you see
new creatures popping up.

2219
01:27:53,311 --> 01:27:55,574
So perhaps someday,
the megalodon

2220
01:27:55,618 --> 01:27:57,272
is coming back to us.

2221
01:27:57,315 --> 01:28:03,060
- Megalodons went extinct
370 million years ago.

2222
01:28:03,103 --> 01:28:08,979
And, in my opinion,
I can't imagine

2223
01:28:09,022 --> 01:28:12,852
any way whatsoever that there's
still any in existence today.

2224
01:28:15,377 --> 01:28:19,206
- In the 70s, "Jaws" is
what, like, irked everybody,

2225
01:28:19,250 --> 01:28:21,644
because it was
confusing people

2226
01:28:21,687 --> 01:28:23,254
on what sharks
were really like.

2227
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:26,779
And I think nowadays, it's
that megalodon mockumentary

2228
01:28:26,823 --> 01:28:29,042
that really irks scientists.

2229
01:28:29,086 --> 01:28:32,568
Because it's the idea
of being--of people being

2230
01:28:32,611 --> 01:28:36,311
tricked into thinking that
there's something out there

2231
01:28:36,354 --> 01:28:38,443
that's not really there
and that

2232
01:28:38,487 --> 01:28:41,577
it could encourage
current negative behavior.

2233
01:28:41,620 --> 01:28:43,535
It did what "Jaws" did
by accident.

2234
01:28:43,579 --> 01:28:47,104
"Jaws" accidentally convinced
people something was real.

2235
01:28:47,147 --> 01:28:51,369
And "The Meg"
mockumentary was trying

2236
01:28:51,413 --> 01:28:53,240
to get people to think

2237
01:28:53,284 --> 01:28:55,852
that something
that wasn't real could be.

2238
01:28:55,895 --> 01:28:57,157
- They aired this show,

2239
01:28:57,201 --> 01:28:58,855
"Megalodon:
The Monster Shark Lives,"

2240
01:28:58,898 --> 01:29:01,379
that claimed that
megalodon is not extinct

2241
01:29:01,423 --> 01:29:03,773
and it's still out there
and it's an active threat

2242
01:29:03,816 --> 01:29:05,340
to you and your family,

2243
01:29:05,383 --> 01:29:06,384
and scientists know that,

2244
01:29:06,428 --> 01:29:07,472
and the government knows that,

2245
01:29:07,516 --> 01:29:08,952
and they're lying to you.

2246
01:29:08,995 --> 01:29:10,519
Don't trust scientists
and the government.

2247
01:29:10,562 --> 01:29:13,348
I have spoken to thousands
of people all over the world,

2248
01:29:13,391 --> 01:29:15,045
giving these public talks

2249
01:29:15,088 --> 01:29:16,481
about sharks
and shark conservation.

2250
01:29:16,525 --> 01:29:18,004
I can't remember
the last time someone

2251
01:29:18,048 --> 01:29:19,397
didn't ask me about megalodon.

2252
01:29:19,441 --> 01:29:23,880
This is--Shark Week
just absolutely broke

2253
01:29:23,923 --> 01:29:26,143
public trust with this.

2254
01:29:26,186 --> 01:29:29,451
- I think that a lot
of shark scientists

2255
01:29:29,494 --> 01:29:32,410
and deep-sea scientists get
really angry with something

2256
01:29:32,454 --> 01:29:36,371
like "The Meg" is because
of all this intrigue and people

2257
01:29:36,414 --> 01:29:37,807
getting passionate
and maybe wanting

2258
01:29:37,850 --> 01:29:39,417
to do something with that.

2259
01:29:39,461 --> 01:29:41,767
And people like that are
really important,

2260
01:29:41,811 --> 01:29:43,856
especially
for ocean conservation,

2261
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:45,467
so it's like you're
seeing this person

2262
01:29:45,510 --> 01:29:47,556
that you need on your team
for real ocean stuff,

2263
01:29:47,599 --> 01:29:49,427
and you're like,
"No, don't go chase mermaids.

2264
01:29:49,471 --> 01:29:51,342
"We need you to help
with like, the manatees

2265
01:29:51,386 --> 01:29:52,735
"that are actually stuck
right now

2266
01:29:52,778 --> 01:29:55,607
in some sort of climate change
thing in Florida."

2267
01:29:55,651 --> 01:29:57,087
Or like, "No, we need
you for the vaquita.

2268
01:29:57,130 --> 01:29:58,567
The vaquita is,
like, a real animal."

2269
01:29:58,610 --> 01:30:01,483
And instead it's like,
"No, we need to get a mission

2270
01:30:01,526 --> 01:30:03,789
to, like, find the meg
that's in the deep sea,"

2271
01:30:03,833 --> 01:30:05,095
which, it's not.
It's just gone.

2272
01:30:05,138 --> 01:30:06,792
It's extinct.
It's super extinct.

2273
01:30:08,620 --> 01:30:10,013
Even if something's extinct,

2274
01:30:10,056 --> 01:30:11,754
we want to believe
it's still around.

2275
01:30:11,797 --> 01:30:13,364
That's the appeal
of "Jurassic Park,"

2276
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:16,106
right, is that there's
this mysterious element

2277
01:30:16,149 --> 01:30:18,543
or thing in the world
that we might be able

2278
01:30:18,587 --> 01:30:20,197
to control or discover.

2279
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:21,764
And we like
to discover things.

2280
01:30:21,807 --> 01:30:24,070
It's part of humanity.

2281
01:30:24,114 --> 01:30:26,682
I think that sharks
become monstrous

2282
01:30:26,725 --> 01:30:28,640
because they do seem so alien.

2283
01:30:28,684 --> 01:30:31,164
Unlike a lot
of other predator creatures

2284
01:30:31,208 --> 01:30:36,387
that we have in our world,
sharks are largely unseen.

2285
01:30:36,431 --> 01:30:38,389
Anything that you've seen
in a movie

2286
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:40,043
is the tip of the iceberg.

2287
01:30:40,086 --> 01:30:42,611
And what's real about sharks
in the ocean

2288
01:30:42,654 --> 01:30:45,962
almost always is
so much cooler.

2289
01:30:46,005 --> 01:30:48,573
What exactly steered me
into marine biology

2290
01:30:48,617 --> 01:30:52,534
was a very specific incident
with a great white shark.

2291
01:30:52,577 --> 01:30:54,884
And so that was
on a fishing boat.

2292
01:30:54,927 --> 01:30:58,017
I was about to win
the jackpot of the boat,

2293
01:30:58,061 --> 01:30:59,671
which is, like,
a really big deal.

2294
01:30:59,715 --> 01:31:03,196
The jackpot on a fishing boat
is the biggest fish.

2295
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:05,677
And it was five days with me
and a bunch of dudes.

2296
01:31:05,721 --> 01:31:08,071
And so, like, I thought I was
gonna have this, like--

2297
01:31:08,114 --> 01:31:10,160
like, independent lady moment.

2298
01:31:10,203 --> 01:31:11,335
But then they yelled shark.

2299
01:31:11,378 --> 01:31:12,728
So a shark came over.

2300
01:31:12,771 --> 01:31:13,816
It was a great white.

2301
01:31:13,859 --> 01:31:17,254
It took my super large tuna.

2302
01:31:17,297 --> 01:31:20,736
It came by just like--I would
compare it to, like, Pac-Man.

2303
01:31:20,779 --> 01:31:22,694
It didn't look
like it had looked in a movie,

2304
01:31:22,738 --> 01:31:24,522
where it's like just all
"Jaws" and, you know,

2305
01:31:24,566 --> 01:31:25,871
moving around a bunch.

2306
01:31:25,915 --> 01:31:27,743
Long story short:
bring up the fishing line.

2307
01:31:27,786 --> 01:31:30,136
And what I have
is just a tuna head.

2308
01:31:30,180 --> 01:31:31,964
What had just happened
to the tuna

2309
01:31:32,008 --> 01:31:34,924
was the shark had bitten it
so efficiently

2310
01:31:34,967 --> 01:31:38,101
that its neurons
were still operating.

2311
01:31:38,144 --> 01:31:40,320
And so what I was looking at
was a head

2312
01:31:40,364 --> 01:31:41,974
that was still gasping for air.

2313
01:31:42,018 --> 01:31:43,976
And I thought it was
the coolest fucking thing

2314
01:31:44,020 --> 01:31:45,412
I'd ever see.

2315
01:31:45,456 --> 01:31:49,547
Because here this shark
had done the thing

2316
01:31:49,591 --> 01:31:52,594
that sharks do on TV or movie,

2317
01:31:52,637 --> 01:31:55,597
which is they kind of, like,
scare you and impress you

2318
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:56,859
at the same time.

2319
01:31:56,902 --> 01:31:58,556
And here, the shark
had done exactly that,

2320
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:01,080
but without doing
all the action

2321
01:32:01,124 --> 01:32:02,342
you see in a scary movie.

2322
01:32:02,386 --> 01:32:04,214
- The first time
I saw a great white,

2323
01:32:04,257 --> 01:32:05,650
you know, in the wild for real,

2324
01:32:05,694 --> 01:32:09,262
for me, it was as if
I had just met Marlon Brando.

2325
01:32:09,306 --> 01:32:10,568
That's the way I felt like.

2326
01:32:10,612 --> 01:32:13,136
Because, you know,
your whole life,

2327
01:32:13,179 --> 01:32:14,398
you read about great whites.

2328
01:32:14,441 --> 01:32:15,399
You read about sharks.

2329
01:32:15,442 --> 01:32:16,487
You watch shark movies.

2330
01:32:16,531 --> 01:32:17,488
You watch shark documentaries.

2331
01:32:17,532 --> 01:32:19,055
You see "Jaws."

2332
01:32:19,098 --> 01:32:22,101
So, like, this creature is
built up so much in your mind.

2333
01:32:22,145 --> 01:32:24,756
And so to actually see it was
like, to me, like, you know,

2334
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:26,018
meeting a Hollywood celebrity.

2335
01:32:26,062 --> 01:32:27,280
It was amazing.

2336
01:32:27,324 --> 01:32:30,240
- When I spent four days
filming sharks

2337
01:32:30,283 --> 01:32:32,677
down in South Australia,
I was surrounded

2338
01:32:32,721 --> 01:32:34,113
by great whites for four days.

2339
01:32:34,157 --> 01:32:36,159
And you know, everything
I saw of their behavior

2340
01:32:36,202 --> 01:32:38,074
was just insanely wonderful.

2341
01:32:38,117 --> 01:32:40,729
I love and really do
respect sharks.

2342
01:32:40,772 --> 01:32:42,687
You know, I live
by the sea and I'm a surfer.

2343
01:32:42,731 --> 01:32:44,428
And I'm in the sea
every second day.

2344
01:32:44,471 --> 01:32:47,605
So for me, sharks,
it's their domain.

2345
01:32:47,649 --> 01:32:49,128
We're just visitors.

2346
01:32:49,172 --> 01:32:50,826
They've got every right
to do what they do there.

2347
01:32:50,869 --> 01:32:53,089
It's not like they're being
malicious or horrible.

2348
01:32:53,132 --> 01:32:54,569
That's just what a shark does.

2349
01:32:54,612 --> 01:32:56,309
If he--you know, occasionally,
there's a shark attack,

2350
01:32:56,353 --> 01:33:00,270
it's because it thought it
could eat you and stay alive.

2351
01:33:00,313 --> 01:33:01,401
- We just don't look
like anything

2352
01:33:01,445 --> 01:33:03,055
that they would want to eat.

2353
01:33:03,099 --> 01:33:06,624
If you looked at a table,
and you had a hamburger on it,

2354
01:33:06,668 --> 01:33:10,410
an onion, a salt shaker,
a bowl of flowers,

2355
01:33:10,454 --> 01:33:13,109
and a pitcher of water,
what are you gonna go for?

2356
01:33:13,152 --> 01:33:14,327
You go for the hamburger.

2357
01:33:14,371 --> 01:33:15,938
And we're the pitcher
of water.

2358
01:33:15,981 --> 01:33:17,156
You know,
we're just not something

2359
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:18,680
they're gonna eat.

2360
01:33:18,723 --> 01:33:20,769
But if we aren't paying
attention to what we're doing

2361
01:33:20,812 --> 01:33:23,641
and we reach down on the table
and we grab the onion,

2362
01:33:23,685 --> 01:33:25,034
we might think it's an apple.

2363
01:33:25,077 --> 01:33:27,210
And we'd pick it up
and take a bite and go, oh.

2364
01:33:27,253 --> 01:33:29,691
Spit it out and go,
that's the wrong thing.

2365
01:33:29,734 --> 01:33:32,171
That's what I think happens
most of the time

2366
01:33:32,215 --> 01:33:34,609
when people are bitten
by sharks.

2367
01:33:34,652 --> 01:33:37,089
- Whenever we tend
to demonize something--

2368
01:33:37,133 --> 01:33:40,049
if that's a human,
or an inanimate object,

2369
01:33:40,092 --> 01:33:41,311
or an animal--

2370
01:33:41,354 --> 01:33:42,660
it's from a lack
of understanding.

2371
01:33:42,704 --> 01:33:46,359
- Peter Benchley used to say
we love our demons.

2372
01:33:46,403 --> 01:33:50,799
[chuckles] And sharks
represent iconically, I think,

2373
01:33:50,842 --> 01:33:52,670
a kind of a demon-y thing.

2374
01:33:52,714 --> 01:33:56,674
Sharks are not demons,
but they are dangerous.

2375
01:33:56,718 --> 01:33:59,155
And when you go
into their wild environment--

2376
01:33:59,198 --> 01:34:01,461
when you go into any animal's
wild environment--

2377
01:34:01,505 --> 01:34:05,030
you've gotta respect
the rules of that environment.

2378
01:34:05,074 --> 01:34:09,818
- We absolutely must have
sharks in the ocean.

2379
01:34:09,861 --> 01:34:12,559
We need our apex predators,

2380
01:34:12,603 --> 01:34:15,040
'cause they keep the balance
in the ocean.

2381
01:34:15,084 --> 01:34:17,826
And if you don't have them,

2382
01:34:17,869 --> 01:34:20,829
the balance gets
all out of whack.

2383
01:34:20,872 --> 01:34:25,224
It's like having the Serengeti
in Africa

2384
01:34:25,268 --> 01:34:26,878
without lions.

2385
01:34:26,922 --> 01:34:28,750
You've got to have the lions

2386
01:34:28,793 --> 01:34:31,274
to keep populations intact

2387
01:34:31,317 --> 01:34:35,017
and keep that ecosystem healthy
and thriving.

2388
01:34:35,060 --> 01:34:39,935
So apex predators, sharks,
are absolutely essential.

2389
01:34:39,978 --> 01:34:42,415
And there are 500 species.

2390
01:34:42,459 --> 01:34:45,244
Don't forget there are others
besides great white sharks.

2391
01:34:45,288 --> 01:34:46,985
- I call, like,
great white sharks,

2392
01:34:47,029 --> 01:34:48,204
like, a gateway drug,

2393
01:34:48,247 --> 01:34:49,684
but like,
they're a gateway shark,

2394
01:34:49,727 --> 01:34:51,468
because, for the people
that are really interested

2395
01:34:51,511 --> 01:34:52,774
in that stuff,
it, like, sucks them

2396
01:34:52,817 --> 01:34:54,514
into the whole world of it.

2397
01:34:54,558 --> 01:34:56,647
There's, like, all these
ridiculous shark movies,

2398
01:34:56,691 --> 01:34:58,649
and they come up
with all these ridiculous ways

2399
01:34:58,693 --> 01:34:59,955
to make the sharks scary,

2400
01:34:59,998 --> 01:35:02,000
and here's these real sharks

2401
01:35:02,044 --> 01:35:04,089
that already do things

2402
01:35:04,133 --> 01:35:06,135
that are a great plot
for a scary movie.

2403
01:35:06,178 --> 01:35:09,616
The ninja lanternshark
is jet black--

2404
01:35:09,660 --> 01:35:11,662
just very, very, very,
very dark black.

2405
01:35:11,706 --> 01:35:14,404
And all the lanternsharks
are glowing

2406
01:35:14,447 --> 01:35:16,232
as an invisibility cloak.

2407
01:35:16,275 --> 01:35:19,670
They're glowing just enough
to hide their shadows.

2408
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:22,368
So basically,
this shark just wants to hide

2409
01:35:22,412 --> 01:35:24,153
before it gets you.

2410
01:35:24,196 --> 01:35:27,722
When it came to the end
of the project,

2411
01:35:27,765 --> 01:35:29,506
okay, we know this is
a real animal.

2412
01:35:29,549 --> 01:35:31,116
We know that we can get
this published.

2413
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:32,465
Now we need to give it a name.

2414
01:35:32,509 --> 01:35:33,945
At the time of the publication,
it was gonna be

2415
01:35:33,989 --> 01:35:37,470
the 40th anniversary of "Jaws."

2416
01:35:37,514 --> 01:35:40,256
And we thought it'd
be really cool to use

2417
01:35:40,299 --> 01:35:42,345
this whole concept
of the "Jaws" effect

2418
01:35:42,388 --> 01:35:44,782
and this obsession with "Jaws."

2419
01:35:44,826 --> 01:35:47,045
And then the other cool thing
was to name it

2420
01:35:47,089 --> 01:35:48,917
after Peter Benchley.

2421
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:51,658
So the common name
of the shark

2422
01:35:51,702 --> 01:35:53,443
is ninja lanternshark.

2423
01:35:53,486 --> 01:35:57,577
And then the scientific name
isEtmopterus benchleyi.

2424
01:35:57,621 --> 01:35:59,710
The genus isEtmopterus.

2425
01:35:59,754 --> 01:36:03,888
And then specifically, it's
named after Peter Benchley.

2426
01:36:03,932 --> 01:36:06,717
And so the way
taxonomic names go is,

2427
01:36:06,761 --> 01:36:09,633
if it's named after a male,
you add an "I."

2428
01:36:09,676 --> 01:36:13,376
So that's why the name is
Etmopterus benchleyi.

2429
01:36:13,419 --> 01:36:14,856
People would
probably think, like,

2430
01:36:14,899 --> 01:36:16,466
"Oh, it's the anniversary,

2431
01:36:16,509 --> 01:36:19,861
and oh, it's because,
you know, 'Jaws' is so cool."

2432
01:36:19,904 --> 01:36:23,386
But in my feeling,
it was to recognize

2433
01:36:23,429 --> 01:36:26,476
all this wonderful work
that the Benchley family

2434
01:36:26,519 --> 01:36:30,088
has done for ocean work
that no one would think about.

2435
01:36:30,132 --> 01:36:34,484
- Right after "Jaws"
and the huge success,

2436
01:36:34,527 --> 01:36:36,529
Peter was asked to do

2437
01:36:36,573 --> 01:36:40,446
many National Geographic
expeditions,

2438
01:36:40,490 --> 01:36:43,275
ABC sportsman expeditions.

2439
01:36:43,319 --> 01:36:46,931
And we very quickly
began to see

2440
01:36:46,975 --> 01:36:48,977
the destruction of the ocean.

2441
01:36:49,020 --> 01:36:52,284
We began to see
sharks being finned.

2442
01:36:52,328 --> 01:36:53,808
So as this happened,

2443
01:36:53,851 --> 01:36:56,245
Peter was being interviewed
more and more

2444
01:36:56,288 --> 01:36:59,422
and said, from his heart,

2445
01:36:59,465 --> 01:37:03,034
"There is no way I could write
'Jaws' now,

2446
01:37:03,078 --> 01:37:06,864
"because I know too much
about the ocean

2447
01:37:06,908 --> 01:37:09,780
and about great white sharks
and sharks in general."

2448
01:37:09,824 --> 01:37:13,044
So we started
to work hard at trying

2449
01:37:13,088 --> 01:37:15,307
to spread
the correct information,

2450
01:37:15,351 --> 01:37:17,570
that sharks need
to be preserved.

2451
01:37:17,614 --> 01:37:21,139
And please, please, please
don't think that because "Jaws"

2452
01:37:21,183 --> 01:37:25,709
was a novel and the movie
is fiction,

2453
01:37:25,752 --> 01:37:28,277
that this is somehow real life.

2454
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:29,931
- Peter noticed
that I was getting

2455
01:37:29,974 --> 01:37:31,497
into conservation work.

2456
01:37:31,541 --> 01:37:34,457
And he said, "I want to do
something meaningful."

2457
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:36,938
So we made--

2458
01:37:36,981 --> 01:37:38,548
I don't know,
it's about a dozen films.

2459
01:37:38,591 --> 01:37:41,029
We called them the "World
of Water Film Series."

2460
01:37:41,072 --> 01:37:46,643
And he and I did that
for the last part of his life.

2461
01:37:46,686 --> 01:37:48,993
And then I got
a phone call from Wendy.

2462
01:37:49,037 --> 01:37:51,561
And she told me he passed.

2463
01:37:51,604 --> 01:37:54,825
And she was crying,
I was crying, you know,

2464
01:37:54,869 --> 01:37:58,394
and she said, "And you know,
Greg, Peter always felt

2465
01:37:58,437 --> 01:37:59,830
"the work that he did with you

2466
01:37:59,874 --> 01:38:02,833
was the most important work
of his life, you know."

2467
01:38:02,877 --> 01:38:06,228
And it wasn't, by any means,
financially the most important,

2468
01:38:06,271 --> 01:38:07,838
nor was it the most popular.

2469
01:38:07,882 --> 01:38:09,971
It was just
the most meaningful.

2470
01:38:10,014 --> 01:38:14,149
- I think Peter would be
thrilled to know nowadays

2471
01:38:14,192 --> 01:38:17,195
how much interest there is
in sharks,

2472
01:38:17,239 --> 01:38:19,589
how much research has
been done,

2473
01:38:19,632 --> 01:38:22,766
that the world understands now

2474
01:38:22,809 --> 01:38:24,637
how important sharks are.

2475
01:38:24,681 --> 01:38:26,901
And there are many, many
environmental groups

2476
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:28,424
working on this issue.

2477
01:38:28,467 --> 01:38:33,124
So we've come a long way
in almost 50 years

2478
01:38:33,168 --> 01:38:34,560
since he wrote "Jaws."

2479
01:38:34,604 --> 01:38:38,825
And I hope that within
the next ten years,

2480
01:38:38,869 --> 01:38:43,221
we really make more progress
on protecting sharks,

2481
01:38:43,265 --> 01:38:45,876
on marine-protected areas,

2482
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:49,401
and on not overfishing
the ocean.

2483
01:38:49,445 --> 01:38:53,362
And you know, what happens is,
if you protect the ocean,

2484
01:38:53,405 --> 01:38:57,018
it has amazing ability
to just come back again.

2485
01:38:57,061 --> 01:39:01,370
And Peter worked really hard
on this all of his life.

2486
01:39:01,413 --> 01:39:04,982
And he always said,
"I'm gonna use 'Jaws'

2487
01:39:05,026 --> 01:39:08,116
"for all it's worth to bring
attention to the ocean

2488
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:11,075
and to the issues
of conservation."

2489
01:39:11,119 --> 01:39:15,123
And so I've continued
with that thought in mind.

2490
01:39:15,166 --> 01:39:18,256
♪

2491
01:39:18,300 --> 01:39:19,997
- After we watched
a shark movie,

2492
01:39:20,041 --> 01:39:22,217
we also have a responsibility
to think

2493
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:24,480
about how sharks are portrayed

2494
01:39:24,523 --> 01:39:26,438
and how you are talking
about sharks.

2495
01:39:26,482 --> 01:39:28,005
Yeah, it's a fun movie.

2496
01:39:28,049 --> 01:39:30,486
But the shark is actually
not a dangerous animal.

2497
01:39:30,529 --> 01:39:34,490
And we have a responsibility
to tell that story also.

2498
01:39:34,533 --> 01:39:35,970
- I know that in my research--

2499
01:39:36,013 --> 01:39:37,493
and I'm sure you've talked
to people

2500
01:39:37,536 --> 01:39:40,278
whose careers were inspired
by seeing "Jurassic Park"

2501
01:39:40,322 --> 01:39:41,976
or watching "Jaws."

2502
01:39:42,019 --> 01:39:43,760
- I saw Matt Hooper.

2503
01:39:43,803 --> 01:39:45,892
They could have put him
in a white lab coat

2504
01:39:45,936 --> 01:39:48,112
with a pencil holder
and notebook,

2505
01:39:48,156 --> 01:39:49,984
but instead, he had jeans,

2506
01:39:50,027 --> 01:39:52,290
he had a beard,
he liked to drink wine,

2507
01:39:52,334 --> 01:39:53,813
he told good jokes.

2508
01:39:53,857 --> 01:39:55,380
- Arguing with a man who's
lining up to be a hot lunch.

2509
01:39:55,424 --> 01:39:57,382
- That's why I think
a lot of oceanographers

2510
01:39:57,426 --> 01:39:58,557
look a bit like me.

2511
01:39:58,601 --> 01:40:00,777
That was the effect
"Jaws" had on me.

2512
01:40:00,820 --> 01:40:03,954
It was--it didn't scare me
out of the ocean.

2513
01:40:03,998 --> 01:40:06,043
It made me want to be
Matt Hooper.

2514
01:40:06,087 --> 01:40:09,003
- Over the years, that shark
became a character...

2515
01:40:09,046 --> 01:40:10,004
- Well, hi.

2516
01:40:10,047 --> 01:40:11,135
- That people loved.

2517
01:40:11,179 --> 01:40:12,615
- Name's Bruce.

2518
01:40:12,658 --> 01:40:15,096
- And people still keep
showing "Jaws."

2519
01:40:15,139 --> 01:40:18,099
I mean, I saw "Jaws" a couple
months ago at the Orpheum.

2520
01:40:18,142 --> 01:40:19,839
They had
over 1,400 people there

2521
01:40:19,883 --> 01:40:22,059
to pay $20 to see this movie

2522
01:40:22,103 --> 01:40:24,018
that's been around
for 40-some years.

2523
01:40:24,061 --> 01:40:26,890
- I think sharksploitation
will never die.

2524
01:40:26,933 --> 01:40:31,634
I think they will continue
to exploit every possible sub,

2525
01:40:31,677 --> 01:40:34,550
sub, sub-basement,
sublevel genre

2526
01:40:34,593 --> 01:40:37,161
of this particular realm
of films.

2527
01:40:37,205 --> 01:40:40,077
- What I'm seeing now
is almost like a renaissance

2528
01:40:40,121 --> 01:40:42,645
where there's, like,
this really cool potential

2529
01:40:42,688 --> 01:40:45,952
to entertain people
with science and facts

2530
01:40:45,996 --> 01:40:48,999
but make it totally
ridiculous at the same time.

2531
01:40:49,043 --> 01:40:51,175
- We've made sharks less scary.

2532
01:40:51,219 --> 01:40:53,264
Again, you know, it's--

2533
01:40:53,308 --> 01:40:57,268
I don't know if we should be
respected for that or reviled.

2534
01:40:57,312 --> 01:40:58,574
- Just give me
that great white,

2535
01:40:58,617 --> 01:41:00,141
let me eat my popcorn,

2536
01:41:00,184 --> 01:41:03,492
let me see it doing
some great white stuff.

2537
01:41:03,535 --> 01:41:08,410
- I'm a fan
of this exaggerated, campy,

2538
01:41:08,453 --> 01:41:12,066
kind of horror sci-fi
where it's very implausible,

2539
01:41:12,109 --> 01:41:13,763
but that doesn't mean
we can't enjoy it.

2540
01:41:13,806 --> 01:41:15,112
And I think that's
the important thing

2541
01:41:15,156 --> 01:41:17,593
with looking at any kind
of horror film

2542
01:41:17,636 --> 01:41:20,639
or any kind of film that paints
