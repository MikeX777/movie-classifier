00:00:01,626 --> 00:00:08,924


3
00:00:20,436 --> 00:00:42,958
?

4
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:46,295
(Dolphins whistling throughout)

5
00:00:46,296 --> 00:01:21,496
?

6
00:01:21,497 --> 00:01:24,916
(Dolphins whistling
throughout)

7
00:01:24,917 --> 00:02:19,930
?

8
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,349
(Dolphin whistling)

9
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:43,537
?

10
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:46,331
(Dolphin whistling)

11
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:49,251
?

12
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,253
(Dolphin whistling)

13
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,922
?

14
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,674
(Alyssa gasping)

15
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,218
(Water lapping)

16
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:00,137
(Dolphin clicking)

17
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,767
(Kita)
90 feet! Your best yet.

18
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,269
I know I can do better.

19
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,270
One more time.

20
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,313
Hello, I think
lack of oxygen

21
00:03:10,314 --> 00:03:11,440
is affecting your brain.

22
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,941
(Rasca chirping)

23
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,234
(Alyssa)
Hey! I thought
you're supposed to be

24
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,861
on my side.

25
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:16,987
(Alyssa sighs)

26
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,823
Alright, alright,
we'll go back.

27
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:25,454
?

28
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:30,751
(Dolphin whistling)

29
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:37,924
?

30
00:03:37,925 --> 00:03:40,552
(Dolphin whistling)

31
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:51,688
?

32
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:52,981
(Daniel)
lf Hawk only knew

33
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,274
what was going on
around here.

34
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,358
(Kita)
Well, how would he?

35
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:56,860
Unless you tell him.

36
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,028
(Daniel)
A father ought to know

37
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,821
that his daughter
is trying to drown herself.

38
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:02,199
(Alyssa)
Oh, come on, Daniel,
you know I know my own limits.

39
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,784
Besides, you know
you're not gonna tell him.

40
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,827
You said you were
only gonna go down 50 feet!

41
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:08,371
She's fine.
Look at her!

42
00:04:08,372 --> 00:04:10,791
Better than fine,
I'd say.

43
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:13,960
Mwah!

44
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:15,837
All the voodoo word play.

45
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:16,838
(Alyssa and Kita laughing)

46
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,424
(Daniel)
Let's get out of here.

47
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,176
(Dolphin whining)

48
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,514
(Dolphin whistling)

49
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,309
(Jet skis droning)

50
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,525
(Kita)
Get a load of that.

51
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,360
(Alyssa laughs)
Ah yeah, judging
by the hottie he's with,

52
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,986
I'd say that one's
been claimed.

53
00:04:39,987 --> 00:04:41,988
Mmm, I'm not above
a little claim jumping,

54
00:04:41,989 --> 00:04:43,156
time to time.

55
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:44,658
Oh, you're shameless.

56
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,077
(Craig)
That wouldn't be
the famous Rasca, would it?

57
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,079
(Styles)
Everyone on the island
is talking about her.

58
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,206
We heard her owner
takes her out around here.

59
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,500
(Alyssa)
Yeah, that's Rasca,
but she doesn't have an owner.

60
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,544
(Rasca chirping)

61
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,254
(Rasca whistling)

62
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,548
(Craig)
Anyway you can get her
to, uh, stay still?

63
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,174
Tryin' to get a shot.

64
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:02,425
Um, I'm sorry,

65
00:05:02,426 --> 00:05:04,261
I think she's a little excited
right now.

66
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,346
(Jet skis humming)

67
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:07,764
We gotta go so, uh,

68
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:10,225
enjoy your stay
in the beautiful Bahamas.

69
00:05:12,144 --> 00:05:15,146
(Boat propellers churning)

70
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,571
(lnstrumental music)

71
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,573
?

72
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:29,286
(Dolphins whistling)

73
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:32,330
?

74
00:05:32,331 --> 00:05:33,999
(Liz)
Mmm hmm.

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,334
Hey there, little fellas.

76
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:37,836
I see you.

77
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,921
I see you looking at me
looking at you.

78
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:40,964
Mmm hmm.

79
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:45,176
(Phone ringing)

80
00:05:45,177 --> 00:05:51,558
?

81
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,767
Lab.

82
00:05:52,768 --> 00:05:54,060
(Man on phone)
Duvey, have you
heard anything

83
00:05:54,061 --> 00:05:55,520
about another stranding?

84
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,771
No.

85
00:05:56,772 --> 00:05:58,440
(Man on phone)
Well, I'm looking at one
right now.

86
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,649
How many?

87
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,944
(Man on phone)
Looks like 15 dolphins,
at least.

88
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,446
Make sure
Hawk knows about it.

89
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,448
It's gonna be
all over the media soon.

90
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:10,118
Hawk, I need you
in here, please.

91
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,787
Hawk?

92
00:06:12,788 --> 00:06:15,165
(Man on phone)
Listen, Noah is sending out
a pathologist from Woods Hole

93
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,125
to do necropsies
on the bodies.

94
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,085
We're gonna find out
what happened here.

95
00:06:19,086 --> 00:06:21,004
(Liz)
Okay, and where were
they found?

96
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,172
(Man on phone)
Providence Channel.

97
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,298
(Liz)
All right.

98
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,800
And they're all
bottlenose dolphins?

99
00:06:25,801 --> 00:06:27,344
(Man on phone)
Maybe a half
a dozen pilot whales

100
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,929
and three pygmy sperms.

101
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,597
(Liz)
Okay, thank you.

102
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,391
(Hawk) Yeah, what?
(Liz) It's another stranding.

103
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:34,392
(Hawk sighs)
Where?

104
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:35,685
Providence Channel.

105
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:36,895
How many?

106
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,064
Fifteen!
And they all dead!

107
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,275
That's like, what,
50 dead dolphins in three weeks?

108
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,443
Something going on, man.

109
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,569
(Hawk)
Hmm.

110
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,529
But as soon as we get
the necropsy reports back, we--

111
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:47,948
You don't need
a necropsy report

112
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,491
to know what's goin' on.

113
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,700
You know
who's doin' this, Liz,

114
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,744
well as I do.

115
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,996
I mean, we talkin'
about the U.S. Navy here,

116
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:58,500
And they say they don't do
sonar testing in the Caribbean.

117
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,501
No, I just sayin'!

118
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,627
I just sayin',
that's what they say,

119
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:01,962
I ain't sayin'
that's what they do.

120
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,713
And anything else
is up for discussion.

121
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:06,049
I don't even understand it.

122
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,594
(Typing)

123
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,471
Where is Rasca?

124
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,348
(Whistling)

125
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,434
(Dolphin whistling)

126
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:19,396
(Female computer voice)
Rasca almost home.

127
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,647
(Hawk)
There's my girl.

128
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:23,149
(Tamika)
Hmm, I hear there's been
another stranding.

129
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,069
Tell me you got
some good news in there.

130
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,489
?

131
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,908
Another threat.

132
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,202
I don't have time for this.

133
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,037
(Liz reading flyer)
"Return your captured dolphins
to the wild,

134
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,497
or we'll do it for you.

135
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,249
This is your last warning.

136
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,876
Wildlife Liberation Front."

137
00:07:41,877 --> 00:07:43,712
(Tamika)
I found some information online.

138
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,005
They claim
to free animals

139
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,548
used for medical
and corporate research

140
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,467
and then burn down the labs.

141
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:50,802
Well you can't burn
this one down.

142
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:51,803
It's underwater.

143
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,264
(Liz)
So what? They don't know
you is the good guy.

144
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,725
These dolphins free
to come and go as they please.

145
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:57,809
They ain't in cages.

146
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,893
Well maybe
I should contact them,

147
00:07:58,894 --> 00:08:00,645
talk to them
about our program.

148
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,731
(Hawk)
It won't do any good.

149
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,691
Doesn't matter to them that
our dolphins aren't captive.

150
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:08,278
They're against any kind
of interaction whatsoever.

151
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,572
To them,
I'm not a good guy.

152
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,698
I'll call the police again.

153
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:12,782
That's all we can do.

154
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,534
Mmm hmm.
See what
I can find out
about them.

155
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:15,952
Okay, thanks.

156
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,038
I can check the
surveillance camera feeds again.

157
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,164
And make sure
those camera feeds

158
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,957
are stored
on the main drive, okay?

159
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,292
(Liz)
Alright.

160
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:25,003
(Hawk)
Lookee there.

161
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,130
(lnstrumental music)

162
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:34,971
?

163
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,222
(Gull cries out)

164
00:08:36,223 --> 00:08:42,187
?

165
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,646
(Rasca whistles)

166
00:08:43,647 --> 00:08:48,568
?

167
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,862
(Dolphins whistling)

168
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,697
(Female computer voice)
Alyssa home.

169
00:08:52,698 --> 00:09:03,374
?

170
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,085
(Dolphins whistling)

171
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,420
?

172
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:09,506
(Alyssa)
Hey guys, missed you, too!

173
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,507
?

174
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,592
(Dolphins chattering)

175
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:16,971
?

176
00:09:16,972 --> 00:09:18,807
Hey Alyssa.

177
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:19,974
Get a rope.

178
00:09:19,975 --> 00:09:22,185
Yes, sir.

179
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:32,320
?

180
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,030
Hey Dad.

181
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:36,366
How many?

182
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,201
(Alyssa sighs)
Not a single pod.

183
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,953
You go diving again?

184
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,246
Dad, you really think
I'd have my fun

185
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,622
before I do my job?

186
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,040
How deep?

187
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,041
I'm gonna
go take a shower,

188
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,459
and then we're gonna go
to the Fish Fry.

189
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,169
And we're gonna
find our man, too.

190
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,046
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would ya?

191
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,423
Mmm.
We'll see
you there.

192
00:09:52,424 --> 00:09:54,968
?

193
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,594
(Tamika)
There's Alyssa.
Hi.

194
00:09:56,595 --> 00:09:58,138
Hey.
Hey!

195
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,639
(Alyssa) Hi baby.
(Baby blows raspberries)

196
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,849
(Women laugh)

197
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,891
Oh.

198
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,101
You going down
to the Fish Fry?

199
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,185
Yeah.

200
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,228
You gonna be there later?

201
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,688
Yeah, we'll come later.

202
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,439
See you, bye.
Say "bye."

203
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,440
Bye.

204
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:10,900
(Tamika) Okay, bye.
(Alyssa) Bye.

205
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:13,611
Bye.

206
00:10:13,612 --> 00:10:16,614
(Hawk)
So, she was
divin' again, huh?

207
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,074
(Daniel)
Rasca was with her.

208
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,659
You know she wouldn't
let anything happen.

209
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,661
She just pushes
the envelope too hard.

210
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,371
Chip off the old block.

211
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:25,081
Tell me about it.

212
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:27,250
Let's go to the Fish Fry;
I'm a little bit hungry.

213
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,711
(Hawk)
Hmm, when are you not?

214
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,880
?

215
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,089
(Children laughing)

216
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,049
(Boy shouting)
Rasca!

217
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,467
Rasca!

218
00:10:36,468 --> 00:10:38,178
(Children shouting)

219
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,763
Jump!

220
00:10:40,764 --> 00:10:43,683
(Children shouting)

221
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:46,269
?

222
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,898
Here, because
this is my room.

223
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:53,484
(Liz)
Oh, look at the lovely
comin' on by!

224
00:10:53,485 --> 00:10:55,361
Wow, you actually
look like you're--

225
00:10:55,362 --> 00:10:56,613
Like a girl, yeah.

226
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:57,947
(Kita) Yeah.
(Liz) Sexy Momma!

227
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,449
And oh, if I could just
put some--

228
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,617
No, no thank you.

229
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,618
Okay, you already
got me in the dress,

230
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,203
let's just make one mistake
at a time, okay?

231
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,204
Oh, okay.

232
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,330
(Alyssa)
You ready?
Yeah.

233
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,414
Let's go.

234
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,415
(Kita)
lf I just add a little bit.

235
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,000
(Alyssa)
No. No!

236
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,628
(Liz)
You stop putting yourself down.

237
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,796
You gotta learn how
to work it out, sweet girl.

238
00:11:13,797 --> 00:11:15,632
Yeah, I mean
you're in your prime time,

239
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,508
gotta get that groove grinding.

240
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:19,052
Ah ha!
I know you like dolphins.

241
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,720
They might
be smooth and silky,

242
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,222
but he ain't no substitute

243
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:25,767
for a strong, strapping,
earth-bound, fur-bearing man.

244
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,101
Did you say
"fur-bearing man"?

245
00:11:27,102 --> 00:11:28,102
Yes, yes, I did.

246
00:11:28,103 --> 00:11:29,354
Well, well-waxed maybe.

247
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,022
No, man.
Hairy.

248
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,190
(Alyssa)
I give up,
you guys are--

249
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,233
(Boys)
Alyssa!

250
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,317
We saw Rasca.

251
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,443
Yeah, did you say hi?

252
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,153
(Boy)
Yeah, but now she's gone.

253
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,154
Oh, well, don't worry,
she'll be back tomorrow,

254
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,155
around in the centre.

255
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:40,490
Can I give her some fish?

256
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,242
Well, Rasca catches
her own fish.

257
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,576
You come see tomorrow.

258
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,161
If you promise not to bite.

259
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,663
Okay.

260
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,499
Alright guys, see ya!

261
00:11:51,835 --> 00:11:53,836
(Women laugh)

262
00:11:53,837 --> 00:11:56,005
(Distant music)

263
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:59,342
(Woman singing)
? Hey Bombay ?

264
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,677
? Hey ?

265
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:03,888
? She's a bright girl ?

266
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:07,100
? She knows nothing
of the world ?

267
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,227
? She's a bright girl ?

268
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,603
?

269
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,604
(Girl)
Hey, Alyssa.

270
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,564
(Alyssa)
Hey.

271
00:12:13,565 --> 00:12:17,318
?

272
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,028
(Liz)
Oh huh, I see you!

273
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,154
I'll check you out.

274
00:12:20,155 --> 00:12:22,532
Look at you, little flirt!

275
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,201
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

276
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,286
Whatever.

277
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,954
Oh God,
they caught us ogling.

278
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:30,873
Okay, you were ogling,
I was merely staring intently.

279
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,583
Well, I prefer ogling.

280
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:34,168
(Liz)
Well, what's the difference?

281
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:36,713
Well, ladies stare,
and - and...

282
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,381
You know what, never mind,
you two are hopeless.

283
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:39,382
Whatever.

284
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:40,717
(Craig)
Hey, excuse me, um,

285
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,218
I saw you guys
on the water today, right?

286
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,219
I was on a jet ski.

287
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,554
Jet ski? Um.

288
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,264
Kita, do you remember
a jet ski?

289
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,515
Not even two of them.

290
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,891
I didn't see no jet skis.

291
00:12:48,892 --> 00:12:50,310
Ah, I'm Craig.

292
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,811
Ah, Alyssa.

293
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:52,937
And this is Kita.

294
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,605
Hi, you're more than welcome
to know me

295
00:12:54,606 --> 00:12:56,065
as much as you like to.

296
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,859
Oh.
She's kidding,
I think.

297
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,901
Ah, this is Liz.

298
00:12:58,902 --> 00:12:59,902
(Kita)
Nice to meet you.

299
00:12:59,903 --> 00:13:00,903
(Craig)
Nice to meet you.

300
00:13:00,904 --> 00:13:02,405
Well, I just -
I wanted to apologize

301
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,240
for crashing
your party earlier.

302
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,325
Oh yeah, no,
don't worry about it,

303
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,659
It happens all the time.

304
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,745
So, what's up
with your girlfriend?

305
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:09,746
Oh, Gwen?

306
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,247
Oh no, no, she's not
my, uh, my girlfriend.

307
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,248
She's my sister.

308
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:13,249
(Kita)
Oh?

309
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,500
And she has a dive scheduled
in the morning,

310
00:13:14,501 --> 00:13:16,252
so she went back
to the hotel early.

311
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,587
Alright, so we'll just
have to look after you

312
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,838
while she's gone.

313
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,174
Oh yeah, we'll take care
of you real good.

314
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,216
(Women laugh)

315
00:13:22,217 --> 00:13:23,593
That works for me.
Cheers.

316
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:24,719
(Kita)
Cheers.

317
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,971
(Craig) Cheers.
(Kita) Cheers.

318
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:35,938
?

319
00:13:35,939 --> 00:13:38,107
Hey.

320
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,193
She's got a new friend.

321
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,779
(Hawk)
Mmm hmm.

322
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,530
?

323
00:13:44,531 --> 00:13:45,531
(Alyssa laughs)

324
00:13:45,532 --> 00:13:47,575
So, is there anything else
to do on this island

325
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:51,204
besides jet skies
and ah, diving?

326
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,246
(Alyssa)
Not really.

327
00:13:52,247 --> 00:13:53,915
Um, we actually spend
most of our time

328
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,625
at the Research Center
with the dolphins.

329
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:56,626
That sounds fun.

330
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:59,462
Yeah, it is.

331
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:04,050
Um, my Dad actually founded
the Research Center.

332
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,135
Ah, we're studying how dolphins
communicate with each other,

333
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,887
as well as how
to better communicate with them.

334
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:11,808
Ah, so you're proving
Carl Sagan wrong?

335
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,684
Carl who?

336
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:15,937
The genius scientist
whose name you should know?

337
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,855
Now, now shush, let's go
get something to drink.

338
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:19,982
Yes, thanks.

339
00:14:19,983 --> 00:14:23,027
You know that, ah -
that famous quote of his,

340
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:26,114
"It is of interest to note
that while some Dolphins

341
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,032
have learned
up to 50 words in English,

342
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,325
no human being has been..."

343
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,244
(Both)
"...has ever been reported
to be able to speak Dolphinese."

344
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:34,664
(Craig)
Right, so my question
to you is:

345
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,041
Do you speak Dolphinese?

346
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:40,002
(Alyssa chuckles)
No, that's actually
physically impossible.

347
00:14:40,003 --> 00:14:41,379
A lot of their sounds
are in frequencies

348
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,005
that we can't even hear.

349
00:14:43,006 --> 00:14:44,715
Right, so how do you do it?

350
00:14:44,716 --> 00:14:45,967
Um well, what we've done -

351
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,009
I guess what my Dad's done

352
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:49,178
is come up with
an artificial whistle language

353
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,888
that both humans and dolphins
can use,

354
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:52,181
um, and we're teaching it
to dolphins

355
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,933
using a model rival training.

356
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,436
Oh, so it's like, um,
lrene Pepperberg

357
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,771
and Alice Gray Perret,
and all that?

358
00:14:58,772 --> 00:14:59,772
Exactly.

359
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,023
How do you know all this?

360
00:15:01,024 --> 00:15:03,359
I am a Discovery Channel junkie.

361
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,735
I can't help myself.

362
00:15:04,736 --> 00:15:06,320
I watch it all the time.

363
00:15:06,321 --> 00:15:08,531
Well, actually my Dad worked
with lrene Pepperberg.

364
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,950
Really?
And ah,
the model rival
training is--

365
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,493
(Kita)
Hey, ah, Craig,
did you know

366
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:15,037
that sex is the glue
of dolphin society?

367
00:15:15,038 --> 00:15:16,038
Really?

368
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:18,499
No, I didn't -
I didn't, uh, know that.

369
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,918
Yeah, ask Alyssa.

370
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,295
Ah, it sounds
kind of crazy,

371
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:25,131
but, um, dolphins
are very social creatures,

372
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,382
and sex--

373
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,675
(Kita)
Hey, I've got
a better idea.

374
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:28,926
Why don't you
actually come down

375
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:30,219
to the Research Center tomorrow

376
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,721
and find out for yourself?

377
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,056
(Liz)
Unfortunately,
standards dictate

378
00:15:34,057 --> 00:15:35,975
that we have to keep
the fishy porn to a minimum.

379
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:36,976
(Kita)
Yes.

380
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:39,854
Please ignore them;
they are demented.

381
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,063
(Liz)
No, seriously,
you should stop by.

382
00:15:41,064 --> 00:15:42,148
I bet you'll learn something.

383
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,817
Okay, well, as long as
I'm getting a good education.

384
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,110
I'm in.

385
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,321
Alright, um, cool,
I'll see you then.

386
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,281
Great.
Um, and
it was, ah -

387
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,532
it was really nice
meeting you guys.

388
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,451
(Liz) Same.
(Craig) Okay, cool.

389
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,038
Yup.

390
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,998
Yeah, not as nice
as it could have been, though.

391
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,875
What - what are
you talking about?

392
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,585
I mean, you have
another chance tomorrow.

393
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:03,920
Oh, I didn't invite him
for me,

394
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,589
I invited him for you.

395
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,175
Despite all attempts
at inappropriate innuendo,

396
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,093
he looked at you
the whole time.

397
00:16:11,094 --> 00:16:13,387
(Liz)
His eyes was
all over you, girl.

398
00:16:13,388 --> 00:16:14,764
(Kita)
Mmm hmm.

399
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:15,765
Really?

400
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,518
Wait, how one girl
could be so smart

401
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,936
and so dumb
at the same time.

402
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:20,937
(Kita) I know.
(Liz) I don't get it.

403
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,146
I don't either.
I don't
get it.

404
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,106
You're serious?
You're not messing with me?

405
00:16:24,107 --> 00:16:26,108
Yes, yes,
he was looking at you.

406
00:16:26,109 --> 00:16:27,109
He likes you.

407
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:29,278
(Liz)
Yeah, come on.

408
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:35,952
(Sonar echoing underwater)

409
00:16:40,123 --> 00:16:42,250
(Alyssa)
Our goal here is to communicate
with dolphins,

410
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,793
but that's hard
because they aren't suited

411
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,461
for making human sounds,

412
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,129
and half their sounds they make
are at frequencies

413
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,923
we can't even hear.

414
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,883
So, the sound you hear
is a recall pinger.

415
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:53,135
Um, it's what we use
to call the dolphin's home.

416
00:16:53,136 --> 00:16:54,262
Do they always come home?

417
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,263
(Alyssa)
Well, not always.

418
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,974
It's their choice,
but most of the time they do.

419
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,268
(Dolphins whistling)

420
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,019
(Recall pinger)

421
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,354
(Girl)
Look!

422
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,397
(Dolphins whistling)

423
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:07,066
(Alyssa)
That's Bogie on the left
and Bacall on the right.

424
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,651
They are called
bottlenose dolphins,

425
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:11,112
or Tursiops truncatus.

426
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,697
So, if we want to communicate
with them,

427
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,990
but we can't make
their sounds,

428
00:17:14,157 --> 00:17:15,658
and they can't make ours,

429
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,034
we have a problem, don't we?

430
00:17:17,035 --> 00:17:19,370
So, we had to come up
with another kind of sound

431
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,455
we could both use
in order to communicate.

432
00:17:21,456 --> 00:17:23,499
Does anybody know
what that might be?

433
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,500
(Girl)
Whistling?

434
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:25,501
(Alyssa)
Exactly!

435
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:28,170
So, we use
a made up whistle language

436
00:17:28,171 --> 00:17:29,839
in order to communicate
with them.

437
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,508
And this is
our current vocabulary.

438
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:35,845
And, as we teach a new word,
it's added to our dictionary.

439
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,306
(Dolphin whistling)

440
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,016
(Alyssa)
Oh, oh, it looks like
Bacall went away.

441
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:43,436
Let's ask Bogie
where he went.

442
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,187
Bogie, where is Bacall?

443
00:17:45,188 --> 00:17:47,106
(Computer whistling)

444
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,025
(Bogie whistling)

445
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,819
(Female computer voice)
Bacall is catching fish.

446
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:53,863
This kind of fish?

447
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,948
(Computer whistling)

448
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:00,202
(Bogie whistling)

449
00:18:00,203 --> 00:18:01,579
(Female computer voice)
No. Dangerous.

450
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,039
(Group chuckles)

451
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,499
(Man)
Come on, you can't expect us
to believe

452
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,544
you're actually having
a conversation with a fish?

453
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,880
Did you hear that,
he called you a fish,

454
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,132
and doesn't believe
we can communicate with you.

455
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,383
(Bogie makes farting noise)

456
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:15,551
(Group laughs)

457
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,470
(Teenage girl)
What's he saying?

458
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,554
Um, I don't know.

459
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:21,974
We haven't really been able to
translate dolphin swearing yet.

460
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:22,975
(Man)
Oh, come on, I mean--

461
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:25,728
So where does this
all lead?

462
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:28,314
I mean, what are you guys
hoping to accomplish?

463
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,524
Well, they're intelligent,
we know that,

464
00:18:30,525 --> 00:18:31,776
and very self-aware.

465
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,486
So, by communicating with them,

466
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,571
we can see
how they perceive the world

467
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,531
and it may add
for further understanding

468
00:18:37,532 --> 00:18:39,575
of the consciousness
in other animals.

469
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:42,536
Are saying that dolphins
are as smart as humans?

470
00:18:42,537 --> 00:18:43,871
No, of course not.

471
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:46,207
I'm saying they are
much, much smarter.

472
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,250
(Group chuckles)

473
00:18:48,251 --> 00:18:50,670
Okay, Bogie,
go find Bacall.

474
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:51,754
See you tomorrow.

475
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:55,091
(Bogie whistling)

476
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,384
Okay guys, follow me

477
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,510
and I'll take you
down to the pool

478
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,221
and you can see
the dolphins up close, okay?

479
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,267
(Alyssa)
Thanks.

480
00:19:05,268 --> 00:19:06,268
For what?

481
00:19:06,269 --> 00:19:08,062
For helping out
with that guy.

482
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,605
Does that happen often?

483
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:13,275
Well, not too often,
but somehow we manage.

484
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,654
(Craig)
So, Rasca never takes part
in these shows?

485
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,698
No, we use her
just for research.

486
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,491
She's not used to it
like Bogie and Bacall.

487
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,327
Actually, she spends
most of her time off base.

488
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:27,873
Um, so you know, if you got
to go back to the hotel--

489
00:19:27,874 --> 00:19:29,375
No, no, no, I actually -

490
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:30,960
I have nowhere to go,
nowhere to be.

491
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,462
Ah, my sister
is still on her dive,

492
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:36,132
and, ah, she may have even met
a really hot diving master,

493
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,967
so she might not be back
for awhile.

494
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,552
(Officer Michael)
Hi, Alyssa.

495
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,554
Oh hey, Officer Michael.

496
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,556
(Officer Michael)
I'm looking for your Dad
and Tami.

497
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,517
They're at the house,
is anything wrong?

498
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,185
(Officer Michael)
Everything's okay, thank you.

499
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:50,479
Okay.

500
00:19:50,480 --> 00:20:26,348
?

501
00:20:26,349 --> 00:20:28,309
(Officer Michael)
Make sure you let us know
of any further threats.

502
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,352
I'll inform the town committee.

503
00:20:30,353 --> 00:20:31,437
Thanks, Thomas.

504
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:32,480
Is there anything else?

505
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,564
No, we'll be fine.

506
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,732
Okay.

507
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,609
Hi, Alyssa.
Hi.

508
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,651
Hi, Dad.

509
00:20:37,652 --> 00:20:38,861
Um, this is Craig.

510
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:39,862
Craig, this is my Dad.

511
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,030
Hi, nice to meet you, sir.

512
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,031
You, too.

513
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,741
But don't call me sir,
it makes me nervous.

514
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,867
(Craig chuckles)
Alright.

515
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,285
And this is
my Step mom, Tamika.

516
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,787
(Craig)
Hi, how are ya?
Nice to meet you.

517
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,413
Is everything okay?

518
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,290
Yeah, yeah, it's fine.

519
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,209
Alright, well,
we'll see you guys later.

520
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,210
(Tamika)
Bye.

521
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,462
(Craig)
See ya.

522
00:20:56,463 --> 00:21:01,634
?

523
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,177
What?

524
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,220
You think you know
what I'm thinking.

525
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,513
(Tamika laughs)
I know exactly
what you're thinking.

526
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:06,514
(Hawk)
You have no idea.

527
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,391
(Tamika)
Of course I know what
you think, I always know.

528
00:21:09,392 --> 00:21:10,559
(Craig)
Wow.

529
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,560
This is beautiful.

530
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:14,814
I mean it -
this is your backyard.

531
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:18,025
This is what you wake up to
every single day, right?

532
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,318
Yeah well, my Dad says

533
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,570
it's the closest thing
on Earth to Heaven.

534
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,572
I'd say he was right.

535
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:26,200
So, does Rasca swim
around here?

536
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,452
Yeah, um, but actually,
I think we're gonna call her

537
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,496
into the Research Center
tomorrow around 1 1 :00,

538
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:32,414
if you, uh -
if you want to come, too?

539
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,624
Yeah.
Unless you have,
you know,

540
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,792
other plans
or whatever.

541
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,752
No, of course,
I'd love to.

542
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:37,753
Really?

543
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:40,339
Yeah, absolutely.

544
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:54,353
?

545
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:56,313
(Styles)
Mmm hmm.

546
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:58,774
(Ominous music)

547
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,609
?

548
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,820
No, not yet.

549
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,321
Right, of course,
I understand.

550
00:22:04,322 --> 00:22:07,491
Clear, identifying photos.

551
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,659
?

552
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,495
He's here,
I'll call you back.

553
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,873
I saw the presentation
they put on for the tourists,

554
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,499
but they don't
use her for that.

555
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,959
They use different dolphins.

556
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,460
She's research only.

557
00:22:18,461 --> 00:22:22,381
I managed to get some audio,
but not enough.

558
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:24,133
Going back
for more tomorrow.

559
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,802
Mmm, good.

560
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:29,972
?

561
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:32,850
Does your friend like you?

562
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,351
?

563
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:36,645
Gettin' it done.

564
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,314
Very good.

565
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,190
(Typing)

566
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:45,195
?

567
00:22:45,196 --> 00:22:46,447
(Dolphin whistling)

568
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:49,366
(Sonar pinging underwater)

569
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,000
There's my girl.

570
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,711
(Rasca chirping and clicking)

571
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,594
All right, you ladies
ready to get started?

572
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:09,929
(Rasca chirping)

573
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,389
What session number
is this?

574
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,891
(Liz)
367.

575
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,895
(Hawk)
Okay, Rasca, session 367.

576
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,147
Alyssa, you're on.

577
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:24,443
What's the same?

578
00:23:25,111 --> 00:23:27,029
(Whistling)

579
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,366
(Rasca whistles)

580
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,534
(Female computer voice)
Colour.

581
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,662
What's different?

582
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,872
(Whistling)

583
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,416
(Rasca whistles)

584
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:42,044
(Female computer voice)
Shape.

585
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:45,881
?

586
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:48,509
(Rasca whistling)

587
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,511
Alright, let's try numbers.

588
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,680
?

589
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:55,099
You see, the dolphins
get bored real easy,

590
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,059
and since we don't use food
to control them,

591
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,520
it helps to have Alyssa
in the water.

592
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,272
Start with four.

593
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,651
(Rasca whistling)

594
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:09,154
?

595
00:24:09,155 --> 00:24:11,073
(Rasca whistling)

596
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:13,200
(Female computer voice)
Four.

597
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,077
Seven.

598
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:18,247
?

599
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,665
(Rasca whistling)

600
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:22,126
(Female computer voice)
Seven.

601
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:28,340
?

602
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:30,259
What's the shape?

603
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,512
(Rasca whistling)

604
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,556
(Female computer voice)
Black.

605
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,433
?

606
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:40,102
(Rasca whistling)

607
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,270
?

608
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,563
What shape?

609
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:46,608
(Rasca whistling)

610
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,069
(Female computer voice)
White.

611
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,654
She knows the answer,
trust me.

612
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,865
She's just not being
challenged enough.

613
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,951
Like a teenage girl,
they get bored easily.

614
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:57,494
Ah, no pictures in here.

615
00:24:57,495 --> 00:24:58,579
(Craig)
Oh, sorry.

616
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,497
Just wanted a memento.

617
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:03,375
(Hawk)
All right, she's had enough.

618
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,461
Rasca, swim with Alyssa.

619
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,087
(Computer whistling)

620
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,548
(Rasca whistling)

621
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:12,301
(Female computer voice)
Rasca happy!

622
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:16,889
?

623
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:22,019
(Phone ringing)

624
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,020
?

625
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,064
Lab.

626
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:30,110
And the results?

627
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,946
You might wanna take this.

628
00:25:32,947 --> 00:25:34,948
Hawk.

629
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:37,493
What?

630
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,495
You're sure?

631
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,955
All right, I'm on the way.

632
00:25:41,956 --> 00:25:49,880
?

633
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,507
All right,
I'll take you up.

634
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,009
(Craig)
Okay.

635
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:57,513
(Soft instrumental music)

636
00:25:57,514 --> 00:26:43,183
?

637
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:45,185
(Rasca whistling)

638
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:47,729
?

639
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,064
(Alyssa)
Hey guys!

640
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,274
(Kita)
Hey.

641
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,400
(Alyssa)
Where did my Dad go?

642
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,610
(Kita)
I don't know.

643
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,239
He got a call
and ran out of here

644
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,117
like a tornado was like
chasing him or something.

645
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:02,536
Rasca.

646
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:03,745
(Kita)
Here you go.

647
00:27:03,746 --> 00:27:06,123
(Alyssa)
Thank you.
I've got some
things to do,

648
00:27:08,459 --> 00:27:10,127
?

649
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:12,379
(Rasca whistling)

650
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:15,507
?

651
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:18,010
Ah, so you do know something
about dolphins.

652
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,428
(Craig)
Yeah, I told you I'm a, uh--

653
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:21,013
Discovery Channel junkie,
mmm hmm.

654
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,347
Do you believe that, Rasca?

655
00:27:22,348 --> 00:27:23,640
(Rasca makes farting sound)

656
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:25,184
I see.

657
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,019
(Kita)
Come on you two,
coffee's ready.

658
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,521
Come on.

659
00:27:34,777 --> 00:27:36,945
Same thing again?

660
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:38,572
(Dr. Waters)
I'm afraid so.

661
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:40,616
How solid's the evidence?

662
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,784
Well, they all show
identical damage

663
00:27:42,785 --> 00:27:44,620
that's consistent
with the upper strandings

664
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,955
after naval exercises.

665
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,081
And by the way,

666
00:27:48,082 --> 00:27:51,460
the earlier stranding's
cranial MRIs are back.

667
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,337
?

668
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,130
Can I get a copy of that?

669
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:56,298
This is your copy.

670
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:59,593
Oh, thanks.

671
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:03,305
?

672
00:28:12,815 --> 00:28:14,233
Looks like you are hungry.

673
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,151
Well, after a week of having

674
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:18,695
conch fritters and conch salad,
and grilled conch,

675
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:21,156
it's good to finally
have some home cooking.

676
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:22,824
What is this?
This is delicious.

677
00:28:22,825 --> 00:28:24,159
Cracked conch.

678
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,160
(Everyone chuckles)

679
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:27,037
(Craig)
Seriously?

680
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,413
(Tamika and Alyssa)
Yeah.

681
00:28:28,414 --> 00:28:29,539
You're an amazing cook.

682
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,583
Well, my Momma always
used to say the best compliment

683
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:33,877
to a woman's cooking
is an empty plate, so.

684
00:28:34,545 --> 00:28:35,754
Boy, you should have seen

685
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:37,839
what her mother
used to prepare for me.

686
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,676
Peas and rice
with plantain on the side,

687
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,928
and the snapper
I used to catch in the bay.

688
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,096
(Craig)
So, she was a good cook, too?

689
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:46,723
Yeah, she used to satisfy me
in other ways, too.

690
00:28:46,724 --> 00:28:48,225
(Kita groans)
Oh.

691
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,601
Oh.

692
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:50,686
Come on.

693
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:53,689
So, how did it go?

694
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,357
How did what go?

695
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:57,359
The first date?
Mmm hmm.
Yeah.

696
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,902
Well, it wasn't a date.

697
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,153
Yeah, no, I assure you,

698
00:29:00,154 --> 00:29:02,364
my intentions
are purely scientific.

699
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:04,116
What, biological sciences, eh?

700
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,117
(Kita laughs)

701
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:06,368
(Alyssa)
Please ignore them.

702
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:08,537
So, how about dinner?

703
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,289
What? Here?

704
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,375
No, Port Lucaya,
just you two.

705
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:16,712
Is she - wait,
is she asking us out on a date?

706
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,046
Well, somebody have to.

707
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:20,382
Yeah, it's never gonna happen
if we don't.

708
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:24,845
Well, how can I refuse
an invitation like that?

709
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,764
This is the part
where you say, "Yes."

710
00:29:27,765 --> 00:29:30,392
Yes, um, yeah,
that'll be great, why not?

711
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:31,435
Okay.

712
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,353
(Tamika sighs)
You two are too much.

713
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:35,063
Don't worry,
we ain't got no shame.

714
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:37,733
And we get results.

715
00:29:38,192 --> 00:29:40,193
(Dramatic music)

716
00:29:40,194 --> 00:29:56,752
?

717
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,086
(Naval officer on air horn)
These are restricted
naval waters.

718
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:00,547
Turn your boat around
immediately.

719
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:03,425
(Hawk on air horn)
I'm here to see
Captain Liath Blaine.

720
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:05,677
(Naval officer)
Turn your boat around
or you'll be arrested.

721
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:06,970
(Hawk on air horn)
Cut the crap!

722
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:10,265
You tell Blaine that
James Harker is here to see him.

723
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:11,266
?

724
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,268
(Naval officer)
Stand by.

725
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:14,603
?

726
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:15,604
(Sailors)
Left!

727
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,272
(Sailor)
Left, right, left.

728
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:20,442
Left, left,
left, right, left.

729
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:23,779
(Voice fading)
Left, left,
left, right, left.

730
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:33,789
?

731
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,332
(Blaine)
Ah.

732
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,458
Dr. Harker.

733
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,710
I've heard quite a bit
about you and your daughter.

734
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:40,837
These are the necropsy results
of two separate groups

735
00:30:40,838 --> 00:30:42,589
of dolphins
and beaked whales,

736
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,174
washed up
in your area of operation

737
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:47,135
in the last two weeks.

738
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,261
Doctor, you and I both know

739
00:30:48,262 --> 00:30:49,471
that there's more
than one reason

740
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:51,640
why marine mammals
become stranded.

741
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,768
There's disease,
parasites, viruses.

742
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:56,853
Bullshit.

743
00:30:56,854 --> 00:30:59,648
This is collateral damage
from your sonar testing.

744
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:02,651
And look at this.

745
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:05,779
Massive haemorrhaging
of the inner ear.

746
00:31:06,989 --> 00:31:09,116
Look at this.

747
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:10,951
That's the cochlea.

748
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,744
It's a part of the inner ear
that controls balance.

749
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:15,831
It's broken down completely,
crushed.

750
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:18,500
So, don't you hand me
that crap about viruses.

751
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,337
All right.

752
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:26,508
Let's say,
for argument's sake,

753
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:28,635
that what you're saying
is right.

754
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:33,890
That Navy sonar is unfortunately
damaging some dolphins.

755
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,977
But, it's minuscule
compared to commercial fishing,

756
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:40,188
which is responsible
for over 600,000 deaths a year.

757
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:42,774
You're responsible
for what you do, Captain.

758
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,443
?

759
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:47,279
This is a dangerous world,
Doctor.

760
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,739
The sonar saves lives,
it saves American lives.

761
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:53,994
Now, the loss of some wildlife
is regrettable,

762
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,203
but unavoidable.

763
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:58,248
California courts held
that it's not unavoidable.

764
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,500
They've ruled that
you not only have the means,

765
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:03,753
but the responsibility to clear
any waters of marine mammals

766
00:32:03,754 --> 00:32:05,672
before you start testing.

767
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:08,633
But you just can't
be bothered, can ya?

768
00:32:08,634 --> 00:32:10,218
?

769
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:13,388
The California ruling is
on appeal to the Supreme Court,

770
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:16,308
and we're expecting
a much more favourable ruling.

771
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,976
And meanwhile, you just
brought your little circus

772
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:20,270
to the Bahamas.

773
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,564
?

774
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:24,649
I'm gonna stop you, Blaine.

775
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:27,486
You can count on it.

776
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:28,612
?

777
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,990
(Blaine)
Your concerns
are duly noted.

778
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:36,161
But, the U.S. Navy
will defend its right

779
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:38,288
to protect American lives.

780
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,081
(Hawk)
Hmm.

781
00:32:40,082 --> 00:32:43,585
Sounds like I've just been
threatened by the U.S. Navy.

782
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:46,421
But Doctor, you're the one
that's been threatening.

783
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,548
That wasn't a threat.

784
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,884
That was a promise.

785
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:52,260
?

786
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:54,429
(Door closing)

787
00:32:54,430 --> 00:33:17,619
?

788
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,250
(Styles)
Well?

789
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,960
(Craig)
Audio is complete.

790
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,461
Everything you need
is on there.

791
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:27,462
And the photos?

792
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:29,673
Still working on it.

793
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,303
You're gonna make me say it?

794
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:38,807
Don't get involved.

795
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:39,808
(Craig snorts)

796
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:42,143
What are you talking about?

797
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,647
(Styles)
You gotta understand something.

798
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:47,941
This work is like
being a surgeon.

799
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:50,235
You operate,
you do your best,

800
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:51,695
but you keep your distance
from the patient

801
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,780
because it doesn't always
end well.

802
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:56,199
Sometimes the patient dies.

803
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,200
?

804
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,452
And if that happens,
you still go home,

805
00:33:59,453 --> 00:34:02,622
you pour yourself a drink
and have dinner.

806
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:04,040
You know
you did your job well

807
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:07,711
and that's the best
you can do.

808
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,087
Life goes on.

809
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:12,132
Understood?

810
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,634
Absolutely.

811
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,886
Good.

812
00:34:16,887 --> 00:34:18,847
I'm gonna head back
to the hotel.

813
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,348
Get some rest.

814
00:34:20,474 --> 00:34:22,017
Tomorrow's a big day.

815
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,352
(Styles)
Good idea.

816
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:34,529
?

817
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,239
(Whistling)

818
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,657
?

819
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:39,909
(Dolphin whistling)

820
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:43,371
?

821
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:45,749
(Dance music)

822
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,083
(Woman singing)
? Together as one ?

823
00:34:47,084 --> 00:34:50,754
? We're together as one
for his honey buns ?

824
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:51,755
?

825
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,715
? Under we're here again ?

826
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:55,091
? Here we go,
here we go ?

827
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:56,926
(Lyrics unclear)
? ...all my friends ?

828
00:34:56,927 --> 00:34:59,137
(Crowd cheering)

829
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:00,221
(Girl)
Alyssa.

830
00:35:00,222 --> 00:35:01,306
(Alyssa)
Hey, guys.

831
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:02,724
(Craig)
You come here a lot?

832
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:04,768
You know, occasionally.

833
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,646
(Woman singing)
? We're together as one
for his honey buns ?

834
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,397
? We bumpin' as one ?

835
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:10,940
? We livin' as one ?

836
00:35:10,941 --> 00:35:14,903
? We're together as one
for his honey buns ?

837
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:17,113
?

838
00:35:17,114 --> 00:35:18,156
I owe you.
Want a drink?

839
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:20,075
Yes, thank you.
Thank you
very much.

840
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,576
(Bartender)
See you later.

841
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:29,292
?

842
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,252
What?

843
00:35:31,253 --> 00:35:33,922
?

844
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:37,550
I really admire
what you're doing with Rasca,

845
00:35:37,551 --> 00:35:40,345
and with the other dolphins.

846
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:43,264
I think it's -
I think it's amazing.

847
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:46,059
I envy you.

848
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:50,563
I'm, uh -
I'm a much different person.

849
00:35:50,564 --> 00:35:53,024
Yeah, um, so was I.

850
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:55,777
I mean, you know,
before I came here.

851
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:58,446
Before I met Rasca.

852
00:35:58,447 --> 00:35:59,572
?

853
00:35:59,573 --> 00:36:02,117
I think you're great.

854
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:04,119
I really do.

855
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,122
I want you to know that.

856
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:09,749
(Soft music)

857
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:18,133
?

858
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,509
(Hawk)
They're killing dolphins,
damn it.

859
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,177
We gotta shut 'em down.

860
00:36:21,178 --> 00:36:24,097
Hawk, this is the U.S. Navy.

861
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:25,390
They fund the foundations

862
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,475
that are funding your research.

863
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:28,476
lf someone makes

864
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:29,936
a few well-placed phone calls,

865
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,062
everything you've worked for

866
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:33,648
could disappear.

867
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,151
I'm not saying you're wrong.

868
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:38,153
I'm saying
protect what we have,

869
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:41,364
'cause what we have
is precious.

870
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,954
(Hawk)
Okay.

871
00:36:49,915 --> 00:36:52,167
Oh, hey guys, get a room.

872
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,793
Oh.

873
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:55,253
Where have you been?

874
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:57,672
Um, I was on a date.

875
00:36:58,632 --> 00:37:00,842
A date?

876
00:37:01,343 --> 00:37:03,553
Yeah, with uh Craig.

877
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,180
You met him yesterday?

878
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:07,307
He seems like a nice guy.

879
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:10,143
Yeah, he is,
he's really nice.

880
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:14,397
Good night.

881
00:37:17,651 --> 00:37:18,985
Come on.

882
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:20,195
Well, I just thought l--

883
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:22,447
Come on, it's late.

884
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,199
You're sneaky.

885
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,909
(Tamika laughs)
Manipulative.

886
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,702
Maybe I like
being manipulated.

887
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:30,163
Come on,
before I get sleepy.

888
00:37:31,665 --> 00:37:33,875
I love you.

889
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:36,252
I love you, too.

890
00:37:36,253 --> 00:37:44,803
?

891
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,054
(Alyssa)
Hey Daniel.

892
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,889
Thought I'd find you here.

893
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,474
(Hawk)
What's up, Sugar?

894
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,226
(Alyssa sighs)

895
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:53,478
It was a nice date.

896
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:54,813
?

897
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,689
Had a good time?

898
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:59,108
It was fun.

899
00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:03,571
I don't know, I mean,
I really like this guy.

900
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:06,825
I don't know how long he's gonna
really be there, you know?

901
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:13,039
?

902
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,749
See that ship?

903
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,668
(Alyssa)
Mmm hmm.

904
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:21,548
(Daniel)
It travels hundreds and hundreds
of miles in the night.

905
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,758
Without a headlight.

906
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:26,928
And all the Captain has
is a course,

907
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:30,890
the pole star,
and a compass.

908
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:31,933
?

909
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:35,436
lf the course isn't right,
he corrects it.

910
00:38:35,437 --> 00:38:38,648
That's like life.

911
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,985
We all have challenges.

912
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,778
?

913
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:46,906
We all have a compass.

914
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,074
?

915
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:52,745
All we have to do
is to find it...

916
00:38:52,746 --> 00:38:55,331
and trust it.

917
00:38:55,332 --> 00:39:03,631
?

918
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:04,841
(Rasca whistling)

919
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:09,679
?

920
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,556
(Rasca whistling)

921
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:37,540
?

922
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,208
(Camera beeping)

923
00:39:39,209 --> 00:39:41,544
?

924
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:43,171
(Camera beeping)

925
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:56,684
?

926
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:58,311
(Rasca whistling)

927
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:52,240
?

928
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,868
(Guitar music)

929
00:40:55,869 --> 00:40:58,246
?

930
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:01,708
So um, when are
you going home?

931
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:04,419
?

932
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,379
Like you said,
it doesn't bother you?

933
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,132
I'm just curious,
that's all.

934
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,591
?

935
00:41:10,592 --> 00:41:12,927
I don't know.

936
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:14,429
You don't give out much,
do you?

937
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,555
(Craig)
What do you mean?

938
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,849
I mean, you know all about me
and my family,

939
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:21,436
and I know nothing
about yours.

940
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,730
What do you wanna know?

941
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:26,774
Um, where did you grow up?

942
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:28,609
Are your parents
still living?

943
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:31,571
Um, what was
your first dog's name?

944
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,197
Favourite condiments.

945
00:41:33,198 --> 00:41:35,658
Um... favourite Spice Girl,

946
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:36,951
and don't tell me
you didn't think they were cool

947
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:38,536
when you were eight?

948
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,329
Boxers or briefs?

949
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:41,998
Uh, what's your job?

950
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:45,001
I mean, I don't know...
the usual.

951
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,794
Oh, wow, okay.

952
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:49,797
Um, okay, well, let's see.

953
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,758
Uh, Central Oregon coast.

954
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,634
Yes, they are both
still alive,

955
00:41:53,635 --> 00:41:55,470
but no longer speak
to one another.

956
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:58,014
Uh, Tabasco mixed
with mayonnaise.

957
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,432
You know, it's sounds
kind of weird,

958
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:01,059
but it's actually really good.

959
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,143
Uh, you should try it.

960
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:06,064
Um, it was a cat,
his name was George,

961
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:09,484
and I still to this day
carry the guilt

962
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,736
about the time I tried
to teach him how to body surf.

963
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:12,737
(Alyssa laughs)

964
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:14,489
Not a good idea.

965
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:18,034
Um, favourite Spice Girl,
man, I don't know.

966
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:21,370
Scary Spice is
the only Spice Girl's name

967
00:42:21,371 --> 00:42:23,581
I can remember,
I swear to God.

968
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:26,501
I know you probably don't
believe me, but it's true.

969
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:30,129
Um, and I'm a boxer briefs
kind of guy.

970
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:33,174
And as far as my job,

971
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:35,301
um, I'm on vacation,

972
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:37,637
so ah,
let's not talk about that.

973
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:40,515
Let's just enjoy this,
fair enough?

974
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:43,017
All right, fair enough.

975
00:42:43,018 --> 00:43:13,381
?

976
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:14,882
(Rasca whistles)

977
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:22,932
?

978
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,433
When I go under,
start the clock.

979
00:43:24,434 --> 00:43:26,894
Alright.

980
00:43:26,895 --> 00:44:52,813
?

981
00:44:52,814 --> 00:44:54,315
(Rasca whistling)

982
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:59,737
?

983
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:02,073
(Rasca whistling)

984
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:10,331
?

985
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:11,666
(Rasca whistles loudly)

986
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,334
(Dramatic music)

987
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:15,336
(Rasca whistles loudly)

988
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:25,388
?

989
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,223
(Rasca whistles)

990
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:40,611
?

991
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:44,240
(Craig pants)

992
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:48,369
?

993
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:49,787
(Rasca chirps)

994
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:50,830
?

995
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:53,874
Come on, come on,
come on.

996
00:45:53,875 --> 00:45:55,126
Come on, cough it up.

997
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:56,294
Come on.

998
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:57,461
Come on, cough it up.

999
00:45:57,587 --> 00:45:59,547
All right,
all right.

1000
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:01,632
Come on, cough it up.

1001
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:03,384
(Rasca whistles)

1002
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:06,887
Come on, come on.

1003
00:46:06,888 --> 00:46:09,223
Come on, cough it up.

1004
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:12,393
?

1005
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:14,186
(Craig grunts)

1006
00:46:14,187 --> 00:46:16,314
Come on, cough it up.

1007
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:17,773
?

1008
00:46:17,774 --> 00:46:18,899
Come on.

1009
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,651
(Alyssa coughs)

1010
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:21,986
You're okay,
you're okay.

1011
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:23,112
You're okay.

1012
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,823
Just breathe,
just breathe.

1013
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:28,492
?

1014
00:46:28,493 --> 00:46:30,494
(Dramatic music)

1015
00:46:30,495 --> 00:46:33,622
?

1016
00:46:33,623 --> 00:46:35,333
(Whispering)
Okay.

1017
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:36,917
(Craig)
This the harbour master?

1018
00:46:36,918 --> 00:46:38,377
Yeah, I've an emergency.

1019
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:41,756
I'm ah - I'm ah,
two miles south of Smith Point.

1020
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:44,925
I'm on a boat
called the Delphinus.

1021
00:46:44,926 --> 00:46:48,054
It's an emergency,
send a boat now.

1022
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,221
Okay.

1023
00:46:49,222 --> 00:46:50,806
You're alright,
you're okay.

1024
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:52,600
Just breathe.

1025
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,894
(Rasca whistling)

1026
00:46:54,895 --> 00:47:20,628
?

1027
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:22,338
(Rasca chirping)

1028
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:26,801
?

1029
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:29,845
(Rasca whistling)

1030
00:47:29,846 --> 00:47:34,975
?

1031
00:47:34,976 --> 00:47:37,645
(Motor starting up)

1032
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:56,664
?

1033
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:58,833
(Rasca whistling)

1034
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:03,671
(Soft music)

1035
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:13,097
?

1036
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,228
(Doctor)
James.

1037
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:21,397
I'm going to have to keep her
for a night or two

1038
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:22,523
for observation.

1039
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:26,735
She's suffered
a cerebral hypoxia.

1040
00:48:26,736 --> 00:48:29,530
That's a deep water black out.

1041
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:31,073
I've given her
a sedative,

1042
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:34,326
so she'll be drowsy
for awhile.

1043
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:39,165
Good thing this fellow
was around.

1044
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,332
Another 30 seconds

1045
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:44,420
and we'd be having
a different conversation.

1046
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,672
Thanks, Wenson.

1047
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:54,805
Dumb kid.

1048
00:48:55,348 --> 00:48:58,017
Ah, it was my fault.

1049
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:00,352
She was telling me
about her free diving

1050
00:49:00,353 --> 00:49:03,272
and I asked her
to show me.

1051
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:06,484
Nah, she doesn't listen
to anybody.

1052
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:09,028
Nice try, though.

1053
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:11,280
?

1054
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,699
(Gull crying)

1055
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:19,079
?

1056
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:22,333
(Rasca whistling)

1057
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:24,627
?

1058
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,795
Don't worry, girl.

1059
00:49:26,796 --> 00:49:28,631
Alyssa's gonna be alright,
alright?

1060
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:31,717
She's coming back
any time soon.

1061
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:34,136
I'll be up there
if you need me, okay?

1062
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:52,446
?

1063
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:55,491
(Jet ski approaching)

1064
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:58,035
(Soft music)

1065
00:49:58,036 --> 00:50:27,565
?

1066
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:29,900
(Styles)
As you can see,
it's the same animal, sir.

1067
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:31,735
The markings match.

1068
00:50:31,736 --> 00:50:35,239
The dolphin they called Rasca
is our Kate.

1069
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,409
She was an integral part
of our marine mammal program.

1070
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,994
After the training incident,

1071
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:42,997
she probably got confused
and lost her bearings.

1072
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:45,124
Training incident?
What training incident?

1073
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,001
Operational details
are restricted

1074
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:48,711
to Marine Mammal
Command personnel,

1075
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:52,298
if you'd like, I can call
Admiral Black in San Diego.

1076
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:53,382
That won't be necessary.

1077
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:56,385
I've already talked
to Admiral Black about you.

1078
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:58,637
Told me all about
the court martial proceedings

1079
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:01,849
that ended your career
in submarine command.

1080
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:05,060
Now they've got you
chasing animals.

1081
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:06,937
Dolphins, sir.

1082
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:08,355
Ah.

1083
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:11,942
Oh, did it ever occur to you
to just ask for the animal back?

1084
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:13,694
You've dealt with Harker.

1085
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:16,155
Do you seriously think
he would voluntarily cooperate

1086
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:17,948
with the Navy?

1087
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:19,950
What's so special
about this dolphin?

1088
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:23,871
With all due respect, sir,
this is no ordinary dolphin.

1089
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:26,957
She's a major investment
in United States security.

1090
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:28,876
Millions of dollars
have been spent training her,

1091
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:31,170
and quite frankly,
a dolphin trained like this

1092
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:33,255
is a threat to civilians.

1093
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:36,550
So really, we'd be
doing everyone a favour.

1094
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:39,845
Shall I call
Admiral Black, Sir?

1095
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:41,764
(Blaine)
No.

1096
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:49,938
Just keep me informed.

1097
00:51:49,939 --> 00:51:52,024
And no surprises.

1098
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:54,151
No surprises, sir.

1099
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,820
Dismissed.

1100
00:51:56,821 --> 00:51:58,280
(Styles)
Thank you.

1101
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:01,116
(Rasca whistling)

1102
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:16,674
?

1103
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:19,009
(Rasca whistling)

1104
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:37,111
?

1105
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:39,988
(Ominous music)

1106
00:52:39,989 --> 00:52:59,133
?

1107
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:02,678
(Whistling)

1108
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,221
?

1109
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:05,431
(Rasca whistles)

1110
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:07,474
(Whistling)

1111
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:11,729
(Rasca whistling)

1112
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:22,364
?

1113
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:24,491
(Rasca whistling)

1114
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:27,703
?

1115
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:30,330
(Rasca sounds distressed)

1116
00:53:30,331 --> 00:53:33,500
?

1117
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:35,961
(Rasca whistling)

1118
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:41,258
(Faint whistling)

1119
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:42,885
?

1120
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:45,304
(Boat motor humming)

1121
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:47,306
?

1122
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:51,226
(Rasca sounding distressed)

1123
00:53:51,227 --> 00:54:00,277
?

1124
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:02,613
(Alyssa)
Please, can I go home?
I'm feeling much better.

1125
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:05,824
(Doctor)
There can be delayed reactions
after something like this.

1126
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:07,409
I need to keep you overnight.

1127
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:08,911
lf all goes well,

1128
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:11,288
you can go home
in the morning.

1129
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:14,833
Now, I'll have to ask you please
to all say your good-byes.

1130
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:17,544
(Nurse)
Dr. Harker,
you have a phone call.

1131
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:19,963
Elizabeth Duvey?

1132
00:54:22,383 --> 00:54:25,260
(Doctor)
Alyssa, I'll see you
in the morning.

1133
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:27,596
(Kita)
Well, get well, okay?

1134
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,264
I will, see ya.

1135
00:54:29,265 --> 00:54:30,265
(Tamika)
Good night, Alyssa.

1136
00:54:30,266 --> 00:54:31,266
Good night.

1137
00:54:31,267 --> 00:54:34,061
(Craig)
See you in the morning.

1138
00:54:36,105 --> 00:54:37,773
(Alyssa sighs)

1139
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:45,364
(Footsteps approaching)

1140
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:48,408
(Hawk)
So, you get
some rest now, okay?

1141
00:54:48,409 --> 00:54:49,451
Is everything okay?

1142
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:50,577
Sure, it's fine.

1143
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:52,120
She just called
to check on ya.

1144
00:54:52,121 --> 00:54:53,872
Alright, see you tomorrow.

1145
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:54,998
Good night, Dad.

1146
00:54:54,999 --> 00:54:56,750
Good night.

1147
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:57,751
What is it?

1148
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:59,545
Rasca.

1149
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:18,021
?

1150
00:55:18,022 --> 00:55:21,024
(Footsteps approaching)

1151
00:55:21,025 --> 00:55:23,193
(Nurse)
Honey, are you alright?

1152
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:25,070
Yeah, I - I'm okay.

1153
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:27,489
You should be sleeping.

1154
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,157
My Dad was really upset
about that phone call.

1155
00:55:29,158 --> 00:55:32,160
Oh, it's so sad.

1156
00:55:32,161 --> 00:55:33,662
And I wonder
who could do that

1157
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:35,956
to an animal?

1158
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:38,000
Well, get some rest

1159
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,835
and I'll see you
in a couple of hours.

1160
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:42,713
Okay, thanks.

1161
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:47,134
?

1162
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:49,887
(Alyssa sighs)

1163
00:55:49,888 --> 00:56:04,067
?

1164
00:56:04,068 --> 00:56:06,069
(Alyssa)
Dad?

1165
00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:08,906
?

1166
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:10,991
Is she gone?

1167
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:14,202
(Hawk sighs)
Looks like it, yeah.

1168
00:56:14,203 --> 00:56:17,039
Wh - Why
didn't you tell me?

1169
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,749
I wanted to be sure.

1170
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:38,310
?

1171
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:41,229
You gotta be strong,
girl.

1172
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:45,442
?

1173
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:47,611
(Alyssa sobs)

1174
00:56:47,612 --> 00:57:01,750
?

1175
00:57:09,842 --> 00:57:12,636
(Christina Thompson)
Rasca, the dolphin
that captured the imagination

1176
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:13,762
of the Caribbean,

1177
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:14,763
has disappeared,

1178
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:17,766
and is believed to have
been forcibly taken.

1179
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:18,976
A letter has been received

1180
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:21,979
from an organization
claiming responsibility

1181
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:24,982
for what it terms
the liberation of the animal.

1182
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:27,109
I spoke earlier
with Dr. James Harker,

1183
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:30,612
head of the International
Dolphin Research Center.

1184
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:32,322
(Hawk)
There were some
threatening letters

1185
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:33,699
and we took
extra precautions,

1186
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,118
but, uh,
I guess they weren't enough.

1187
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:39,329
(Thompson)
Asked what action he plans
to take to recover the dolphin,

1188
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:41,456
Dr. Harker
had this to say:

1189
00:57:41,457 --> 00:57:45,043
I wanna promise you this,
whoever you are,

1190
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:46,169
we're gonna find you.

1191
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:48,505
No brag, just fact.

1192
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:50,298
(Thompson)
This is Christina Thompson
reporting.

1193
00:57:50,299 --> 00:57:53,635
Back to you in the studio.

1194
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:54,636
?

1195
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:57,305
(Footsteps approaching)

1196
00:57:57,306 --> 00:58:00,892
?

1197
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:05,647
Admiral Black
sends his congratulations.

1198
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:06,940
Everything's going smoothly.

1199
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:09,359
We just need you
to stick around here

1200
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,987
for a little while,
'til things quiet down.

1201
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:14,364
Okay.
What about you?

1202
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:15,365
My job is done here.

1203
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:16,742
We'll retrain the dolphin

1204
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:17,909
and transport it
out of the area.

1205
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:20,328
I'll deal with that,
you deal with this.

1206
00:58:20,329 --> 00:58:22,330
Right?
Then return to base.

1207
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:24,499
Craig.

1208
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:25,667
Yeah.

1209
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:28,503
This operation is a success.

1210
00:58:28,504 --> 00:58:30,881
Do your job and make sure
it stays that way.

1211
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:34,009
lf something goes wrong now,
youre gonna take the fall.

1212
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,385
Court martials
can be quite messy,

1213
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:37,763
I'd hate to see
your career end like that.

1214
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:40,599
?

1215
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,185
(Footsteps receding)

1216
00:58:43,186 --> 00:59:03,497
?

1217
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:05,332
(Knocking on door)

1218
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:08,710
(Alyssa) Hey.
(Craig) Hey.

1219
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:10,754
How are you feeling?

1220
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:13,590
I've been better.

1221
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:21,181
Heard about what happened
on the news.

1222
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:23,058
Yeah.

1223
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:26,812
The police just left
and they are completely useless.

1224
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:28,563
What I don't understand is
if these people wanted

1225
00:59:28,564 --> 00:59:30,315
to release her in the wild
like they claimed,

1226
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:32,651
she would have just
come back home.

1227
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:36,154
Doesn't make any sense.

1228
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:38,990
Organizations like this...

1229
00:59:38,991 --> 00:59:41,535
what they do,

1230
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:44,412
doesn't always make sense.

1231
00:59:44,413 --> 00:59:49,209
?

1232
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:52,254
What kind of people
would do something like this?

1233
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:58,009
?

1234
00:59:58,010 --> 00:59:59,344
(Craig sighs heavily)

1235
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:01,429
Really sorry you're, uh...

1236
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:04,099
you're going through this
right now.

1237
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,100
?

1238
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:08,103
I know it's hard,
but try not to think about it.

1239
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:09,604
Try and get some rest,

1240
01:00:09,605 --> 01:00:12,274
and, uh,
I'll check up on you

1241
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:14,442
first thing
in the morning, okay?

1242
01:00:14,443 --> 01:00:16,987
(Whispering)
Okay.

1243
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:18,989
Okay.

1244
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,783
?

1245
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,118
Good night.

1246
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,494
Night.

1247
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:27,330
And thanks, Craig.

1248
01:00:27,331 --> 01:00:30,584
(Door opening and closing)

1249
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:38,258
?

1250
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:40,260
(Hawk sighs)

1251
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:45,515
?

1252
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:48,018
(Computer chimes)

1253
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:54,107
?

1254
01:00:54,108 --> 01:00:55,483
(WLF man)
Dr. Harker,
I'm a representative

1255
01:00:55,484 --> 01:00:58,570
of the Wildlife
Liberation Front.

1256
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:01,323
I know you've been attempting
to contact us.

1257
01:01:01,490 --> 01:01:03,366
We're aware of a dolphin
in your care

1258
01:01:03,367 --> 01:01:04,951
that was abducted.

1259
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:08,121
We deny any involvement
with the abduction.

1260
01:01:08,122 --> 01:01:09,206
Go on.

1261
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:10,790
We're both victims here.

1262
01:01:10,791 --> 01:01:12,626
It's obvious that someone
is trying to damage

1263
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:13,668
both of our causes.

1264
01:01:13,669 --> 01:01:15,337
Any idea who?

1265
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:16,421
I'm sure you know

1266
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:19,007
that there's a marine mammal
holding facility at AUTEC,

1267
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:21,468
the U.S. Naval base
on Andros Island.

1268
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:22,510
Yeah.

1269
01:01:22,511 --> 01:01:24,846
Lately,
it's been abnormally active.

1270
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:26,723
I'm sending you a document
that'll shed light

1271
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:28,391
on this whole area.

1272
01:01:28,392 --> 01:01:30,685
We have no quarrel with you.

1273
01:01:30,686 --> 01:01:33,188
Good luck.

1274
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:35,357
(Suspenseful music)

1275
01:01:35,358 --> 01:02:06,054
?

1276
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:08,807
(Liz)
Hawk!

1277
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:11,059
Hawk, come here.

1278
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:19,734
?

1279
01:02:19,735 --> 01:02:22,862
Pull it back.

1280
01:02:22,863 --> 01:02:25,073
Yeah, right there.

1281
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:28,410
?

1282
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:32,205
Damn!

1283
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:39,587
?

1284
01:02:39,588 --> 01:02:42,882
(Rasca whining)

1285
01:02:42,883 --> 01:02:45,427
?

1286
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:48,263
Come on, Kate.

1287
01:02:48,264 --> 01:03:00,275
?

1288
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:03,445
(Rasca whining)

1289
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:10,702
?

1290
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:12,829
Morning.

1291
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:13,872
Coffee?

1292
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:14,873
Thank you.

1293
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:18,501
Island brewed,
shake the cobwebs out.

1294
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:24,799
(Hawk)
Alyssa really
seems to like you.

1295
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:27,552
I feel the same way.

1296
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:29,220
So, you guys, uh,
having any luck

1297
01:03:29,221 --> 01:03:30,722
in finding Rasca?

1298
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:32,640
Matter of fact,
we just got a lead last night,

1299
01:03:32,641 --> 01:03:34,642
I'm gonna run it down
this morning.

1300
01:03:34,643 --> 01:03:37,854
I'm sure Alyssa would like it
if you came along.

1301
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:39,606
Yeah, of course.

1302
01:03:39,607 --> 01:03:41,066
Good.

1303
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:43,360
I'll go wake her.

1304
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:54,329
?

1305
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:57,207
(Propellers churning)

1306
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:03,046
We're going to Andros?

1307
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:05,465
Yup.

1308
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:07,384
Isn't there a naval base
out there?

1309
01:04:07,385 --> 01:04:09,177
A-U-T-E-C
or something?

1310
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:11,763
That's right, AUTEC.

1311
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:14,849
So, that would mean that these
are restricted waters.

1312
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:16,935
You would be right.

1313
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:19,145
I don't understand, I thought
we were gonna look for Rasca?

1314
01:04:19,146 --> 01:04:22,148
We are.

1315
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:26,611
Why are we here?

1316
01:04:26,612 --> 01:04:29,114
(Boat engines slowing)

1317
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:30,490
(Hawk)
Up ahead
in that Naval base

1318
01:04:30,491 --> 01:04:33,576
is a dolphin training facility.

1319
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:37,580
Why don't you tell us
about it, Craig?

1320
01:04:37,581 --> 01:04:39,749
Better yet,
tell Alyssa.

1321
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:40,875
?

1322
01:04:40,876 --> 01:04:43,837
What's the matter,
cat got your tongue?

1323
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:47,382
It wasn't an activist
organization that stole Rasca.

1324
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:49,717
It was the U.S. Navy.

1325
01:04:49,718 --> 01:04:51,845
Craig here is in the Navy.

1326
01:04:51,846 --> 01:04:53,972
?

1327
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:56,558
I'd guess an Ensign.

1328
01:04:56,684 --> 01:04:58,518
Alyssa,
it's not like that.

1329
01:04:58,519 --> 01:05:00,895
(Hawk)
Computers were on
the night Rasca was taken.

1330
01:05:00,896 --> 01:05:02,564
They show Alyssa's whistles
were used

1331
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:04,649
to lure Rasca
out of the pen.

1332
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:05,650
The other day at the lab

1333
01:05:05,651 --> 01:05:09,279
did you have a tape recorder
in your pocket?

1334
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,072
What, you recorded me?

1335
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:12,532
You used me?

1336
01:05:12,533 --> 01:05:14,242
(Hawk)
Tell the truth, boy.

1337
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:15,618
(Naval officer on air horn)
You're in
restricted naval waters.

1338
01:05:15,619 --> 01:05:18,037
Turn your boat around
immediately.

1339
01:05:18,038 --> 01:05:22,584
?

1340
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:25,587
I didn't have a choice.

1341
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:29,048
?

1342
01:05:29,049 --> 01:05:30,425
(Craig sputtering)

1343
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:36,097
?

1344
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:39,601
Let's go home,
darlin'.

1345
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:42,604
(Boat engines revving up)

1346
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:51,738
?

1347
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:53,281
(Alyssa sobbing)

1348
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:54,949
He was lying to me
the whole time,

1349
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:56,034
and I was such an idiot

1350
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:57,535
that I - I -
I fell for it.

1351
01:05:57,536 --> 01:06:00,747
(Daniel)
Hey, there's your challenge
right there.

1352
01:06:00,748 --> 01:06:03,875
And I know you can
overcome it.

1353
01:06:03,876 --> 01:06:05,919
(Alyssa whispering)
Yeah.

1354
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,338
(Alyssa sniffing)

1355
01:06:09,798 --> 01:06:12,300
What are we gonna do?

1356
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:19,641
Well, taking on
the entire U.S. Navy,

1357
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:21,643
that can get messy.

1358
01:06:25,731 --> 01:06:29,692
These people
came into our home.

1359
01:06:29,693 --> 01:06:33,029
They took a member
of our family.

1360
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:34,239
?

1361
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,740
They crossed a line,

1362
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:39,118
and we can't allow it
to stand.

1363
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:40,495
?

1364
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:43,456
We fight this together.

1365
01:06:43,582 --> 01:06:44,749
?

1366
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:47,252
As a family.

1367
01:06:47,253 --> 01:07:01,808
?

1368
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:05,186
(Ominous music)

1369
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:07,021
(Craig)
Rasca!

1370
01:07:07,022 --> 01:07:08,189
Come on, girl.

1371
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:09,691
Rasca!

1372
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:11,192
Rasca.

1373
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:12,360
Come here, girl.

1374
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:13,528
Up, up, up!

1375
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:14,654
That's a good boy.

1376
01:07:14,655 --> 01:07:15,989
See Kate?
That's how it's done.

1377
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:17,407
lf you put on
a camera vest,

1378
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:18,449
you get one of these.

1379
01:07:18,450 --> 01:07:19,450
Good boy, Oscar.

1380
01:07:19,451 --> 01:07:20,535
(Craig)
Her name's not Kate,

1381
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:21,953
and I don't think
she's gonna respond very well

1382
01:07:21,954 --> 01:07:23,162
to reward training,
either.

1383
01:07:23,163 --> 01:07:24,455
The Navy says
her name is Kate,

1384
01:07:24,456 --> 01:07:26,291
her name is Kate.

1385
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:27,917
Get the vest on her.

1386
01:07:27,918 --> 01:07:29,919
(Craig sighs)

1387
01:07:31,672 --> 01:07:32,755
Rasca!

1388
01:07:32,756 --> 01:07:34,674
Come here, girl!

1389
01:07:34,675 --> 01:07:35,883
Come on, girl,
there you go.

1390
01:07:35,884 --> 01:07:37,719
Good girl, good girl.

1391
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,761
Come on, girl.

1392
01:07:38,762 --> 01:07:40,305
Put this on you, okay?

1393
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:43,766
I know, I know, come on.

1394
01:07:43,767 --> 01:07:46,728
Come here, girl.

1395
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:49,522
Rasca!

1396
01:07:49,523 --> 01:07:51,024
Just get it on her.

1397
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:52,859
Rasca.

1398
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:54,736
Come here, girl.

1399
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:56,988
(Sad music)

1400
01:07:56,989 --> 01:08:04,579
?

1401
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:06,456
(Hawk)
It's official
U.S. Navy document.

1402
01:08:06,624 --> 01:08:08,458
Talks about a dolphin
you folks had

1403
01:08:08,459 --> 01:08:10,168
in your training program
named Kate.

1404
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:12,128
Went missing
about three years ago.

1405
01:08:12,129 --> 01:08:13,504
And how your researchers
believed

1406
01:08:13,505 --> 01:08:16,591
this other dolphin named Rasca
might be the same dolphin.

1407
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:17,759
lf they can prove it,

1408
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,594
well then it's, uh,
how does it say,

1409
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:22,930
" Recovery of the
animal is authorized."

1410
01:08:22,931 --> 01:08:24,390
Where did you get this?

1411
01:08:24,391 --> 01:08:26,893
I can't tell you that,
I'd have to kill ya.

1412
01:08:27,978 --> 01:08:30,897
Blaine, you got 48 hours
to return my dolphin,

1413
01:08:30,898 --> 01:08:33,232
or I go to CNN.

1414
01:08:34,109 --> 01:08:35,443
I don't need that.

1415
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:37,820
Got plenty of copies.

1416
01:08:37,821 --> 01:08:41,532
?

1417
01:08:41,533 --> 01:08:44,619
Come here, girl.

1418
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:45,828
Rasca!

1419
01:08:45,829 --> 01:08:48,956
(Sailor)
Ensign Morrison,
Lieutenant Styles?

1420
01:08:48,957 --> 01:08:49,957
Yes?

1421
01:08:49,958 --> 01:08:52,669
Captain Blaine
wants to see you.

1422
01:08:55,047 --> 01:08:56,047
(Craig sighs)

1423
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:02,387
Harker was just in here
with a 48-hour ultimatum

1424
01:09:02,388 --> 01:09:05,598
and he gave me these.

1425
01:09:05,599 --> 01:09:07,517
Do either of you
have any idea

1426
01:09:07,518 --> 01:09:09,477
how he got his hands
on them?

1427
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:13,022
No, sir.

1428
01:09:13,023 --> 01:09:14,816
You jokers aren't
under my command,

1429
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:17,318
but you are now
my problem.

1430
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:19,320
(Dialing phone)

1431
01:09:20,864 --> 01:09:23,408
Ensign, give me San Diego,
Admiral Black.

1432
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:25,410
Sir, please.

1433
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:27,120
?

1434
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:30,998
Ensign,
hold that call.

1435
01:09:30,999 --> 01:09:32,917
Sir, we can have the dolphin
out of here

1436
01:09:32,918 --> 01:09:35,002
before Harker goes
to the media.

1437
01:09:35,003 --> 01:09:37,505
Then all he'll have
is documents.

1438
01:09:37,631 --> 01:09:39,632
Documents can be forged.

1439
01:09:39,633 --> 01:09:40,758
It'll blow over.

1440
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:43,302
Let me clean this up,
then call Admiral Black.

1441
01:09:43,303 --> 01:09:45,680
(Ominous music)

1442
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:47,515
So, you want to solve
the problem

1443
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:48,975
before you present it
to your boss.

1444
01:09:48,976 --> 01:09:51,394
You're trying to protect
your career, aren't you?

1445
01:09:51,395 --> 01:09:53,521
I can have her out
tomorrow.

1446
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:57,191
?

1447
01:09:57,192 --> 01:10:00,445
We're gonna resume
sonar testing tomorrow.

1448
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:01,487
Nothing in and out
of the harbour

1449
01:10:01,488 --> 01:10:02,655
while the testing
is going on.

1450
01:10:02,656 --> 01:10:06,784
I will not reschedule
to accommodate you.

1451
01:10:06,785 --> 01:10:08,286
But if you can have
that animal out of here

1452
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:09,704
by tomorrow night...

1453
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:10,872
We can, sir.

1454
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:13,541
(Blaine)
Don't you dare screw up.

1455
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:16,377
?

1456
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:18,087
Dismissed.

1457
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:26,304
?

1458
01:10:26,305 --> 01:10:28,055
There's something
going on here,

1459
01:10:28,056 --> 01:10:29,390
and I don't think
you're telling me.

1460
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:31,184
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1461
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:33,102
Yeah, you do.

1462
01:10:33,103 --> 01:10:35,313
Do you wanna know
what I think?

1463
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:37,899
I think that this
is your personal operation.

1464
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:38,983
I don't think
that Admiral Black

1465
01:10:38,984 --> 01:10:40,735
knows anything about this.

1466
01:10:40,736 --> 01:10:42,320
You're in this with me
whether you like it or not.

1467
01:10:42,321 --> 01:10:44,614
Your fingerprints
are all over it.

1468
01:10:44,615 --> 01:10:46,240
I go down,
you go down.

1469
01:10:46,241 --> 01:10:48,743
Yeah,
I'm calling San Diego.

1470
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:51,746
Craig, a dolphin like Kate
is worth more

1471
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:53,706
than you'll see
in a decade.

1472
01:10:53,707 --> 01:10:56,167
The training,
the capabilities--

1473
01:10:56,168 --> 01:10:58,127
Wait, wait, wait,
hold on a second.

1474
01:10:58,128 --> 01:11:00,630
You do this for the money?

1475
01:11:00,756 --> 01:11:02,006
You're crazy.

1476
01:11:02,007 --> 01:11:04,425
(Styles)
I already have a buyer,
Craig.

1477
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:06,636
?

1478
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:09,430
Two million dollars.

1479
01:11:09,431 --> 01:11:10,932
And all you have to do

1480
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:13,518
is be quiet
and let it happen,

1481
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:14,769
and you get a cut.

1482
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:16,062
Well, I don't want
your money.

1483
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:17,146
I think you're insane.

1484
01:11:17,147 --> 01:11:18,940
Am I?

1485
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:21,484
Who's getting hurt
by this?

1486
01:11:21,485 --> 01:11:23,986
Your little friend
and her family?

1487
01:11:23,987 --> 01:11:25,279
They'll get over it,

1488
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,740
and so what if I'm boosting
another country's capabilities,

1489
01:11:27,741 --> 01:11:28,866
it doesn't matter.

1490
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:31,953
Tomorrow when Rasca disappears,
so do I.

1491
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:33,621
?

1492
01:11:33,622 --> 01:11:35,748
And it'll be clear
when the dust settles,

1493
01:11:35,749 --> 01:11:38,125
that this was my op,
not yours,

1494
01:11:38,126 --> 01:11:39,627
and you were just
following orders

1495
01:11:39,628 --> 01:11:42,922
from a superior officer.

1496
01:11:42,923 --> 01:11:44,090
Me.

1497
01:11:44,091 --> 01:11:47,218
On the other hand,
if you report this,

1498
01:11:47,219 --> 01:11:49,095
I'll make sure
that everyone understands

1499
01:11:49,096 --> 01:11:50,346
that you were in on it
from the beginning.

1500
01:11:50,347 --> 01:11:52,807
ln fact, that it was your idea
to start with

1501
01:11:52,808 --> 01:11:54,642
and then you just
lost your nerve in the end.

1502
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:56,644
You'll be finished.

1503
01:11:56,645 --> 01:11:57,979
Dishonourable discharge,

1504
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,814
five years
in the military prison,

1505
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:02,275
is that what you want,
Craig?

1506
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:03,985
Think about it.

1507
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:06,988
You're smart,
that's why I picked you.

1508
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:11,033
(Receding footsteps)

1509
01:12:11,034 --> 01:12:15,079
?

1510
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:18,207
(Hawk)
I should have never
given them 48 hours.

1511
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:20,543
Should have gone to CNN
right off the bat.

1512
01:12:20,669 --> 01:12:23,504
You don't have to give them
the 48 hours, Hawk.

1513
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:24,589
Well, we know where she is.

1514
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:25,840
We just need to figure out
a way to break in

1515
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:27,091
and get her back.

1516
01:12:27,092 --> 01:12:29,176
(Craig)
That would never work.

1517
01:12:29,177 --> 01:12:34,515
?

1518
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:36,642
(Daniel)
What the hell are you
doing here?

1519
01:12:36,643 --> 01:12:40,396
?

1520
01:12:40,397 --> 01:12:42,648
Alright,
listen to me.

1521
01:12:42,649 --> 01:12:44,567
You wouldn't get within
a half a mile of the base

1522
01:12:44,568 --> 01:12:47,028
before you got spotted,
alright?

1523
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:48,029
There's only one way

1524
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:49,155
that you're gonna
get Rasca back

1525
01:12:49,156 --> 01:12:51,699
and you need my help.

1526
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:53,618
No, I don't trust him.

1527
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:56,203
Yeah, me neither.

1528
01:12:56,204 --> 01:12:58,331
?

1529
01:12:58,332 --> 01:13:01,042
Alright, you got one minute.

1530
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:03,753
Navy is doing sonar testing
tomorrow.

1531
01:13:03,754 --> 01:13:06,213
It means another group
of dead dolphins,

1532
01:13:06,214 --> 01:13:09,133
and they're never tagged.

1533
01:13:09,134 --> 01:13:10,134
?

1534
01:13:10,135 --> 01:13:12,470
I'm following ya.

1535
01:13:12,471 --> 01:13:14,722
?

1536
01:13:14,723 --> 01:13:16,140
It means
we gotta kill Rasca.

1537
01:13:16,141 --> 01:13:18,225
(Tamika)
What?!

1538
01:13:18,226 --> 01:13:21,395
?

1539
01:13:21,396 --> 01:13:23,606
And we need a diversion.

1540
01:13:23,607 --> 01:13:26,484
?

1541
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:29,111
I'll take care of that.

1542
01:13:29,112 --> 01:14:02,603
?

1543
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:05,272
(Ominous music)

1544
01:14:05,273 --> 01:14:24,917
?

1545
01:14:24,918 --> 01:14:27,253
(Hawk)
Okay Daniel,
we're in position.

1546
01:14:27,254 --> 01:14:30,131
Stand by.

1547
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:43,978
?

1548
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:47,815
(Sonar pulsing)

1549
01:14:47,941 --> 01:14:55,948
?

1550
01:14:55,949 --> 01:14:57,825
(Rasca whistling excitedly)

1551
01:14:57,826 --> 01:15:04,623
?

1552
01:15:04,624 --> 01:15:09,170
(Sonar pulsing)

1553
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:31,442
?

1554
01:15:31,443 --> 01:15:32,526
I wouldn't do that.

1555
01:15:32,527 --> 01:15:50,044
?

1556
01:15:50,045 --> 01:15:52,963
Get out of the water,
Craig.

1557
01:15:52,964 --> 01:15:55,716
Looks like your meal ticket
just swam away.

1558
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:56,884
?

1559
01:15:56,885 --> 01:16:00,971
(Sonar pulsing)

1560
01:16:00,972 --> 01:16:03,307
(Dramatic music)

1561
01:16:03,308 --> 01:16:06,393
?

1562
01:16:06,394 --> 01:16:08,229
(Sonar pulsing)

1563
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:17,696
?

1564
01:16:17,697 --> 01:16:20,449
(Sonar pulsing)

1565
01:16:20,450 --> 01:16:46,225
?

1566
01:16:46,226 --> 01:16:50,062
(Rasca whistling)

1567
01:16:50,063 --> 01:16:53,107
(Boat engine)

1568
01:16:53,108 --> 01:17:20,259
?

1569
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:23,804
(Alyssa and hawk laughing)

1570
01:17:23,805 --> 01:17:25,472
(Rasca chattering excitedly)

1571
01:17:25,473 --> 01:17:38,402
?

1572
01:17:38,403 --> 01:17:41,488
(Hawk laughing)

1573
01:17:41,489 --> 01:17:45,367
?

1574
01:17:45,368 --> 01:17:46,619
(Hawk)
She looks alright.

1575
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:48,329
(Alyssa)
Yeah.

1576
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:51,165
?

1577
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:56,837
(Boat engine revving)

1578
01:17:56,838 --> 01:17:58,923
(Dramatic music)

1579
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:24,365
?

1580
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:26,367
You are in possession
of Navy property,

1581
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:29,536
I order you to return it
to base immediately, Harker!

1582
01:18:29,537 --> 01:18:31,705
?

1583
01:18:31,706 --> 01:18:34,041
She's not property,
she's a dolphin.

1584
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:35,501
This is pointless,
Harker,

1585
01:18:35,502 --> 01:18:36,835
you know we'll get her back.

1586
01:18:36,836 --> 01:18:38,337
I don't think so.

1587
01:18:38,338 --> 01:18:40,256
Rasca knows how to live
in the wild.

1588
01:18:40,257 --> 01:18:41,715
Once I get her
to a thermocline,

1589
01:18:41,716 --> 01:18:43,259
you're never gonna
track her down.

1590
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:44,718
(Sailor)
They're testing
out there today, Ma'am.

1591
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:46,512
I know that!

1592
01:18:46,513 --> 01:18:52,559
?

1593
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:55,521
I order you
to stop your vessel!

1594
01:18:55,522 --> 01:18:57,314
?

1595
01:18:57,315 --> 01:19:00,067
(Jet skis buzzing)

1596
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:12,121
?

1597
01:19:12,122 --> 01:19:14,415
(Muttering)
I don't believe this.

1598
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:17,710
?

1599
01:19:17,711 --> 01:19:18,836
Do not slow down.

1600
01:19:18,837 --> 01:19:20,587
Make way!

1601
01:19:20,588 --> 01:19:22,631
?

1602
01:19:22,632 --> 01:19:24,216
(Sailor)
We're gonna hit them!

1603
01:19:24,217 --> 01:19:26,302
I don't care,
go around them.

1604
01:19:26,303 --> 01:19:43,610
?

1605
01:19:43,611 --> 01:19:45,112
Make way!

1606
01:19:45,113 --> 01:20:02,463
?

1607
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:06,425
(Drone of jet ski)

1608
01:20:06,426 --> 01:20:39,750
?

1609
01:20:39,751 --> 01:20:41,752
(Crack of flare gun)

1610
01:20:41,753 --> 01:20:46,382
?

1611
01:20:46,383 --> 01:20:49,468
Red, let her through.

1612
01:20:49,469 --> 01:20:51,929
?

1613
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:54,348
(Boat engine starting)

1614
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:57,351
(Boat engine chugging)

1615
01:20:57,352 --> 01:21:08,695
?

1616
01:21:08,696 --> 01:21:10,906
(Boat engine chugging)

1617
01:21:10,907 --> 01:21:18,914
?

1618
01:21:18,915 --> 01:21:21,750
(Boat engine speeding up)

1619
01:21:21,751 --> 01:21:25,462
(Suspenseful music)

1620
01:21:25,463 --> 01:21:47,943
?

1621
01:21:47,944 --> 01:21:49,945
STOP - YOUR - VESSEL!

1622
01:21:49,946 --> 01:21:55,075
?

1623
01:21:55,201 --> 01:21:57,661
Alright, alright,
you got me.

1624
01:21:57,662 --> 01:22:01,081
(Styles)
Where's the dolphin?

1625
01:22:01,082 --> 01:22:04,668
Well, she's around here,
somewhere.

1626
01:22:04,669 --> 01:22:07,254
Alright, girl,
time to give yourself up.

1627
01:22:07,255 --> 01:22:13,218
?

1628
01:22:13,219 --> 01:22:14,428
(Alyssa)
Hey, Dad.

1629
01:22:14,429 --> 01:22:16,221
Whoa! I surrender!

1630
01:22:16,222 --> 01:22:17,264
(Hawk laughs)

1631
01:22:17,265 --> 01:22:18,599
?

1632
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:21,602
(Sailor)
Lieutenant Styles,
put down the weapon.

1633
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:23,437
?

1634
01:22:23,438 --> 01:22:25,606
Put it down now!

1635
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:38,660
?

1636
01:22:38,661 --> 01:22:41,079
(Rasca whistling)

1637
01:22:41,080 --> 01:23:01,308
?

1638
01:23:01,309 --> 01:23:04,269
(Loud sonic blast)

1639
01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:05,270
?

1640
01:23:05,271 --> 01:23:08,398
(Ominous music)

1641
01:23:08,399 --> 01:23:12,819
(Rumbling aftershock)

1642
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:19,993
?

1643
01:23:19,994 --> 01:23:22,913
(Alyssa)
Anything wrong?

1644
01:23:22,914 --> 01:23:25,457
No, let's go home.

1645
01:23:25,458 --> 01:23:43,517
?

1646
01:23:43,518 --> 01:23:45,185
(Reporter)
Unfortunate news
from the Bahamas

1647
01:23:45,186 --> 01:23:46,979
where it has been determined
that a dolphin

1648
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:49,231
missing from the International
Dolphin Research Center

1649
01:23:49,232 --> 01:23:52,150
was among a group which beached
themselves two days ago.

1650
01:23:52,151 --> 01:23:54,528
Earlier I spoke with
marine forensic scientist,

1651
01:23:54,529 --> 01:23:56,154
Mitchell Waters,
about this development.

1652
01:23:56,155 --> 01:23:59,366
(Dr. Waters)
Death occurred due
to active sonar tests.

1653
01:23:59,367 --> 01:24:01,702
The necropsy was conclusive
in that regard.

1654
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:04,204
Navy Lieutenant, Gwen Styles,
has been arrested

1655
01:24:04,205 --> 01:24:05,831
in connection
with the abduction.

1656
01:24:05,832 --> 01:24:07,874
Documents found
in her possession

1657
01:24:07,875 --> 01:24:09,668
confirmed that
she had planned to sell

1658
01:24:09,669 --> 01:24:10,711
the highly-trained dolphin,

1659
01:24:10,878 --> 01:24:12,212
which is said
to have been worth

1660
01:24:12,213 --> 01:24:14,214
as much as
two million dollars.

1661
01:24:14,215 --> 01:24:16,049
(Daniel)
Hey Hawk...

1662
01:24:16,050 --> 01:24:19,720
Somebody out front
wanna see you.

1663
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:46,455
?

1664
01:24:46,456 --> 01:24:50,626
Funny thing
about those necropsies...

1665
01:24:50,627 --> 01:24:52,502
Seems that all the carcasses
were destroyed

1666
01:24:52,503 --> 01:24:55,464
before the Navy got a chance
to examine them.

1667
01:24:55,465 --> 01:24:58,175
Hmm, were they?

1668
01:24:58,176 --> 01:24:59,676
A shame.

1669
01:24:59,677 --> 01:25:00,927
lf I were a detective,

1670
01:25:00,928 --> 01:25:03,805
I'd think you pulled
a fast one on us.

1671
01:25:05,975 --> 01:25:09,686
But, if the Navy says
the dolphin is dead,

1672
01:25:09,687 --> 01:25:13,106
then the dolphin is dead.

1673
01:25:13,107 --> 01:25:14,775
Thanks.

1674
01:25:16,986 --> 01:25:18,737
Classified documents.

1675
01:25:18,738 --> 01:25:20,656
I think you've earned
the right to see them.

1676
01:25:23,785 --> 01:25:27,454
They're gonna be on the news
in a couple of hours.

1677
01:25:29,999 --> 01:25:33,001
The Supreme Court
ruled against us.

1678
01:25:33,002 --> 01:25:35,629
We're not gonna test here again.

1679
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:39,132
We're probably on our way
back to California.

1680
01:25:39,133 --> 01:25:42,052
Where you'll just
keep on testing.

1681
01:25:42,053 --> 01:25:43,428
With increased safeguards.

1682
01:25:43,429 --> 01:25:45,430
Harker, you moved the needle.

1683
01:25:46,641 --> 01:25:48,433
And you got an old sailor
to think twice,

1684
01:25:48,434 --> 01:25:52,479
and I think
that's something.

1685
01:25:52,480 --> 01:26:06,702
?

1686
01:26:06,703 --> 01:26:08,704
Well?

1687
01:26:08,705 --> 01:26:10,414
?

1688
01:26:10,415 --> 01:26:14,960
Daniel, everybody's got to have
something to believe in.

1689
01:26:14,961 --> 01:26:17,379
Right now,
I believe I'll have a beer.

1690
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:19,214
(Daniel laughs)

1691
01:26:19,215 --> 01:26:23,635
?

1692
01:26:23,636 --> 01:26:27,055
(Woman singing)
? So wherever
I'm to settle in ?

1693
01:26:27,056 --> 01:26:29,307
? It's gonna be
up to the winds ?

1694
01:26:29,308 --> 01:26:35,063
? Of New Orleans or Mexico ?

1695
01:26:35,064 --> 01:26:38,608
She seems happy.

1696
01:26:38,609 --> 01:26:41,611
Yeah.

1697
01:26:41,696 --> 01:26:43,989
?

1698
01:26:43,990 --> 01:26:47,325
Listen, uh...

1699
01:26:47,326 --> 01:26:51,121
I know that you'll never
be able to forgive me.

1700
01:26:51,122 --> 01:26:54,916
I want you to know that
I'm not expecting that of you.

1701
01:26:54,917 --> 01:27:00,756
?

1702
01:27:00,757 --> 01:27:02,174
What about you?

1703
01:27:02,175 --> 01:27:04,801
I mean, are -
are you in trouble?

1704
01:27:04,802 --> 01:27:06,303
Yeah, I'm in some trouble,

1705
01:27:06,304 --> 01:27:07,387
but I have an attorney,

1706
01:27:07,388 --> 01:27:09,931
and he thinks that, uh,
I'll be able to get off

1707
01:27:09,932 --> 01:27:12,225
with a, uh,
simple discharge.

1708
01:27:12,226 --> 01:27:14,895
Maybe even an honourable one.

1709
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:17,939
Chance for me
to start over, you know?

1710
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:23,904
?

1711
01:27:23,905 --> 01:27:28,408
So, what are you
gonna do now?

1712
01:27:28,409 --> 01:27:30,243
I don't
know what I'll do,

1713
01:27:30,244 --> 01:27:34,372
but, uh, I do know
where I'd like to be.

1714
01:27:34,373 --> 01:27:36,458
Here.

1715
01:27:36,459 --> 01:27:38,752
That is, of course,
as along you don't think

1716
01:27:38,753 --> 01:27:40,754
I'll be run off the island
by the locals.

1717
01:27:40,755 --> 01:27:44,716
(Alyssa laughs)
Well, I think you're okay
on that.

1718
01:27:44,717 --> 01:27:47,803
You know, there might even
be a position for you

1719
01:27:47,804 --> 01:27:51,556
at the, uh,
Dolphin Research Center.

1720
01:27:51,557 --> 01:27:52,557
?

1721
01:27:52,558 --> 01:27:54,768
I'd like that.

1722
01:27:54,769 --> 01:27:59,439
?

1723
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,149
(Rasca whistling)

1724
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:03,652
(Water splashing)

1725
01:28:03,653 --> 01:28:17,874
?

1726
01:28:17,875 --> 01:28:19,960
Hey guys.

1727
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:20,961
?

1728
01:28:20,962 --> 01:28:23,547
The whole family
is up there.

1729
01:28:23,548 --> 01:28:26,800
Why don't you come up
and join us?

1730
01:28:26,801 --> 01:28:27,968
Wanna go?

1731
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:30,095
(Quietly)
Yeah.

1732
01:28:30,096 --> 01:28:59,165
?

1733
01:28:59,166 --> 01:29:01,877
(Piano music)

1734
01:29:02,003 --> 01:29:12,888
?

1735
01:29:12,889 --> 01:29:15,807
? I used
to believe ?

1736
01:29:15,808 --> 01:29:19,603
? in bein'
alone ?

1737
01:29:19,604 --> 01:29:21,187
? Never
thought
no one ?

1738
01:29:21,188 --> 01:29:23,064
? was out
there ?

1739
01:29:23,065 --> 01:29:25,525
?

1740
01:29:25,526 --> 01:29:29,905
? But you gave
me a reason ?

1741
01:29:29,906 --> 01:29:33,158
? to
understand ?

1742
01:29:33,159 --> 01:29:35,160
? Changed
all my
plans ?

1743
01:29:35,161 --> 01:29:39,372
? And you're
my world now ?

1744
01:29:39,373 --> 01:29:42,667
? I promise
you ?

1745
01:29:42,668 --> 01:29:46,212
? all that
I am ?

1746
01:29:46,213 --> 01:29:49,716
? I'll be
a hero ?

1747
01:29:49,717 --> 01:29:52,427
? Whenever
I can ?

1748
01:29:52,428 --> 01:32:27,999
?
