1
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:28,900
Councilman.

2
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:29,733
Good morning.

3
00:00:29,743 --> 00:00:31,320
Councilman, the pig dog ass.

4
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,153
What did you call me?

5
00:00:32,163 --> 00:00:32,986
No, what did you call her?

6
00:00:32,996 --> 00:00:34,410
I called her pig dog because

7
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,370
cunt bitch whore takes too long.

8
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,460
Let the record show that 91% of AIDS

9
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,860
babies are black or Latino.

10
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,090
You blocked the health care measures.

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:41,923
What's up with that?

12
00:00:41,933 --> 00:00:43,190
Let the record show people of color

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,190
die faster and in disproportionate numbers.

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,680
You block treatment to the people.

15
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,910
There's death in the street
and blood on your hands.

16
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,060
We want AIDS hospice and
health to this district now.

17
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:53,160
We're dying and you're doing nothing.

18
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,701
Call my office...

19
00:00:54,711 --> 00:00:55,534
We want needle exchange for drug users.

20
00:00:55,544 --> 00:00:56,616
We die, you do nothing.

21
00:00:56,626 --> 00:00:58,276
You're deadlier than the virus.

22
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,970
We are black faggots
with a political agenda.

23
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,563
We your worst nightmare.

24
00:01:03,573 --> 00:01:04,680
Who do you think you're talking to?

25
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:05,513
A murderer!

26
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:08,210
And we gonna fight you to the death.

27
00:01:44,457 --> 00:01:46,874
♪ Party time ♪

28
00:02:02,013 --> 00:02:03,013
Boo!

29
00:02:08,025 --> 00:02:09,025
Ah!

30
00:02:13,446 --> 00:02:14,696
La la la la la.

31
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,240
Mmm.

32
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,230
Some folks got AIDS and some folks

33
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,350
got Magic Johnson disease.

34
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,550
Folks with Magic Johnson
disease is innocent victims.

35
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,960
Well, I ain't got Magic Johnson disease

36
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:55,260
and I ain't got Ryan White's disease.

37
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:58,600
I got AIDS, dammit and I
got it by sucking dick,

38
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,600
getting fucked and
sticking needles in my arm

39
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,850
and the government doesn't give a shit.

40
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,080
I am not innocent.

41
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:09,050
I was never innocent, but I am strong.

42
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,330
Just picture it.

43
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,430
If I was a weak woman, I'd be
out killing mother fuckers.

44
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,700
No, that's where you're wrong.

45
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,990
This goes far beyond freedom of protest.

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,480
This goes far beyond freedom of expression.

47
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,030
This goes far beyond even
simple assault and battery.

48
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,890
This is attempted murder
and while I appreciate

49
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,560
the expressions of sympathy that have been

50
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,410
conveyed by the mayor and
the police commissioner,

51
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,430
I will not be satisfied until these people

52
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,260
are found and brought to justice.

53
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,720
You'll have to excuse
me, we're running late.

54
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,470
Thank you all very much.

55
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,420
Repeating our top story.

56
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,240
Councilman Melvin Freeman
was attacked by faggots

57
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,530
outside his Greenwich
Village home this morning

58
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,780
making it the third attack in as many weeks

59
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:10,120
by this gang of self-proclaimed
raging, atheist,

60
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:14,280
meat-eating, HIV positive,
colored terrorists.

61
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,440
So I had him up in the bed

62
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:20,910
and that juicy Latin
dick was just a swinging.

63
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,680
So I unzipped it and girl,
the meat just fell out.

64
00:04:25,635 --> 00:04:26,512
So when you woke up what happened?

65
00:04:26,522 --> 00:04:27,980
It's true.

66
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,813
Believe it.

67
00:04:28,823 --> 00:04:30,320
I put my teeth marks on him.

68
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,790
Dear, can't you just
spray like the other animals?

69
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,090
Oh, please, just 'cause you never

70
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,950
actually got the knack
of classic dick sucking...

71
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,490
Oh, hooker I will suck a dick 'til the head

72
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,400
caves in and the balls scream mercy.

73
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:43,100
And you know I'll cut your
heart out to get to some dick.

74
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,933
I know you won't.

75
00:04:43,943 --> 00:04:44,766
You know I will.

76
00:04:44,776 --> 00:04:45,740
I bet you should.

77
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,573
You know I could.

78
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:47,583
I bet you did.

79
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:49,990
Oh, please.

80
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,700
Girl, for someone so gorgeous, you sure

81
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,580
don't know how to work it.

82
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,700
You'd look so stunning in girl drag.

83
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:58,140
I just can't think what
I'd do with you, though.

84
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,243
Max, did you think about what I said?

85
00:05:01,253 --> 00:05:02,301
Said what?

86
00:05:02,311 --> 00:05:05,470
Max, did you think about what I said?

87
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,350
What he say?

88
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,183
You so cute!

89
00:05:07,193 --> 00:05:08,860
Come on, it could work.

90
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,590
He trusts me implicitly.

91
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,870
We could sneak in his office.

92
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,870
We could drug him.

93
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,210
I even bought chloroform.

94
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,580
Wait a minute, you want
us to kidnap a politician?

95
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,908
I want us to kidnap Melvin Freeman.

96
00:05:20,741 --> 00:05:22,470
You're such a rotten child.

97
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,490
When I was giving birth to you,

98
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,518
I should have crossed my legs and inhaled!

99
00:05:26,821 --> 00:05:29,590
Lucy, you know you just wanna get Freeman

100
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,598
so you can work some trade.

101
00:05:31,608 --> 00:05:33,630
like the rest of us.

102
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,230
We're talking about the
real AIDS acquisition files.

103
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,130
Look out, Dan, a flows in a tizzy.

104
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,070
I'm the one who works there.

105
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,560
I'm the one who knows what's going on.

106
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,000
Yes, but you're not the one who knows

107
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:44,650
what's going on in the real world, Sam.

108
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,530
Let's get real.

109
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,030
Trade, all he wants is trade.

110
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,910
I know this'll work.

111
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,773
I know if you'll only trust me.

112
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:52,090
No!

113
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,810
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

114
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,723
Brava!

115
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:58,556
No.

116
00:05:58,566 --> 00:05:59,700
That was awful what you just did.

117
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,380
Look, that's all I got to say

118
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,213
on the subject, okay?

119
00:06:02,223 --> 00:06:03,060
Will you just think...

120
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,090
Washroom trade.

121
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,560
Central palm trade.

122
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:10,350
Prospect for trade.

123
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,560
Washington Square Park trade.

124
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,530
I know this'll...

125
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,610
Grand Central Station trade.

126
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,443
He only trusts me.

127
00:06:16,453 --> 00:06:18,545
The World Trade Center.

128
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:22,700
bathroom trade.

129
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,510
Honey, to the death, to the death.

130
00:06:30,794 --> 00:06:31,995
Just call it what it is.

131
00:06:32,005 --> 00:06:33,051
It's dick, honey.

132
00:06:39,206 --> 00:06:40,131
Hey!

133
00:06:40,141 --> 00:06:41,500
Hello, sweetheart.

134
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:44,291
Say hello to your worst
technical nightmare.

135
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,770
I know you missed me.

136
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,860
Wanna take away some more of my rights?

137
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,693
Give me a kiss.

138
00:06:49,703 --> 00:06:51,540
Show me you love me.

139
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:55,370
Who here is HIV positive?

140
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,570
Come on.

141
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,727
Don't disappoint me.

142
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,580
Well, I've got news for you.

143
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,413
What?

144
00:07:09,423 --> 00:07:12,570
We are all HIV positive.

145
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,440
Tell 'em, girl.

146
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:19,890
You and you and you and you

147
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,760
and your brothers and your sisters

148
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,050
and your mothers and all your chillens.

149
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,070
AIDS is number one on the charts

150
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,770
as the number one killer of black women.

151
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,420
I am Jamela and HIV positive.

152
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,335
Positively dangerous when
I'm pissed so don't try it.

153
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,600
Move, Silas, I don't want to hear that.

154
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,410
We are going to church this Sunday.

155
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,790
Boy, don't you be talking to me like that.

156
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,240
Don't be rolling your eyes at me like that.

157
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,760
Boy, what is wrong with you?

158
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,230
This is Sunday and every Sunday
I have to go through this.

159
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,650
I don't want to hear it
no more, you hear me?

160
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,120
We are going to church
and I don't wanna know

161
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,720
anything about it.

162
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,690
Larry, hmmm.

163
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,730
We are going to church.

164
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,590
Now, if you wanna come
along, you can go upstairs

165
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,900
and get yourself a tie and come on,

166
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,850
otherwise, keep your cocksucking ass here.

167
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,700
You call yourself a church lady and talking

168
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,740
about cocksuckers, you should be...

169
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,117
Well, that is what they do with it.

170
00:08:25,127 --> 00:08:27,171
You old woman.

171
00:08:27,181 --> 00:08:28,420
Who are you calling old, honey?

172
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,253
You!

173
00:08:29,263 --> 00:08:30,430
Who am I standing in front of?

174
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,450
Honey, I do not wanna hear...

175
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,110
A big old sinner, that's what you are!

176
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,094
You ain't nothing but a sinner.

177
00:08:36,104 --> 00:08:37,793
But you can't even...

178
00:08:37,803 --> 00:08:39,168
You big sissy, you.

179
00:08:39,178 --> 00:08:40,511
You can call me whatever you want to.

180
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:41,355
Big old sinner.

181
00:08:41,365 --> 00:08:43,783
Sinner, sinner, sinner,
that's what you are.

182
00:08:43,793 --> 00:08:45,721
The biggest sinner in Harlem.

183
00:08:45,731 --> 00:08:46,554
I will see you Thanksgiving.

184
00:08:46,564 --> 00:08:47,764
Fine, I'll bring the turkey.

185
00:08:54,795 --> 00:08:55,618
Step up.

186
00:08:55,628 --> 00:08:56,451
Maybe we should carry him.

187
00:08:56,461 --> 00:08:58,150
Another step, step up high, higher.

188
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,420
Yeah, it's kinda rocky, be careful now.

189
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,030
Keep walking forward, forward.

190
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,970
Step up.

191
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,330
But you did beat us, Dada.

192
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,220
It's...

193
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,053
No, sir.

194
00:09:06,063 --> 00:09:06,886
Yes, you did.

195
00:09:06,896 --> 00:09:07,719
I remember very well.

196
00:09:07,729 --> 00:09:08,570
Poor little Max.

197
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,440
I must have been what, about nine years old

198
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,273
and you used to chase me 'round and 'round

199
00:09:11,283 --> 00:09:14,092
the kitchen table beating
me with the frozen dinners.

200
00:09:14,102 --> 00:09:14,925
Dinners, that's right.

201
00:09:14,935 --> 00:09:17,510
You used to chase me up
that tree in the back yard.

202
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,860
I used to have to wait there for hours

203
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,900
for you to cool off Dada.

204
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,080
Don't you remember that?

205
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:23,740
No, sir, I don't remember that.

206
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,196
Of course you don't remember that.

207
00:09:26,206 --> 00:09:28,840
Three dresses, one for the kitchen,

208
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,140
one for church and one for bed.

209
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,886
That's all Mama could have.

210
00:09:32,896 --> 00:09:34,641
Now how could a woman
live in three dresses?

211
00:09:34,651 --> 00:09:35,474
Not so.

212
00:09:35,484 --> 00:09:36,307
Could you live...

213
00:09:36,317 --> 00:09:37,140
Oh, yes it was so, Dada.

214
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:39,210
How could a woman live
in three dresses her whole,

215
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,497
and you were making so much money, Dada.

216
00:09:41,507 --> 00:09:42,482
Hand over fist.

217
00:09:42,492 --> 00:09:43,352
Really, me and Jamela saw your paystubs

218
00:09:43,362 --> 00:09:44,270
on the bureau.

219
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,070
Jamela, Jamela, where is your baby?

220
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,950
Don't bring the baby to see me.

221
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,350
I thought I told you.

222
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,280
She's staying with Aunt Flo.

223
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,284
With Aunt Flo?

224
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:55,120
Yeah, she's been there...

225
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,220
You don't love your baby.

226
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,100
Of course I love my baby.

227
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,730
I just had some things to take care of.

228
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,980
I had some things to attend to.

229
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,279
There's nothing more important for a mother

230
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:08,253
to attend to than to suckle her child...

231
00:10:08,263 --> 00:10:11,130
Shut, up let me handle this.

232
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,080
You don't know what is more important

233
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,100
for a mother to do for her baby.

234
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,120
I had to leave her with Aunt Flo because

235
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,260
it was the best thing for her.

236
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,710
She is healthy.

237
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,830
She is well-loved.

238
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,972
And I care about her.

239
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,390
Day when there would be war over baby.

240
00:10:36,316 --> 00:10:37,866
A little child shall lead them.

241
00:10:39,033 --> 00:10:41,740
There you go off again, please.

242
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,450
I'm going to pray for you.

243
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:47,150
I'm going to pray that God
will show you the way...

244
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,983
Yeah, well...

245
00:10:47,993 --> 00:10:50,820
And I will pray for you too, Maxwell

246
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,350
so that when you have your children,

247
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,690
God will show you the
right way not to leave

248
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,270
your children with other people

249
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,434
and not to take care of them...

250
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:07,400
Oh Lord, I pray and I pray that I'm so glad

251
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,750
my children are healthy and good...

252
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:18,524
Dada, Dada, Dada, Dada, Dada.

253
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,240
I think that's enough praying.

254
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:30,170
In a related story, 23 gay and lesbian

255
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,110
activists were arrested
during a city hall sit-in

256
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,640
accusing the government
of secretly compiling

257
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:39,310
comprehensive lists of
all HIV positive people

258
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,250
in the Tri-State area.

259
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,090
Councilman Hardigan denied the existence

260
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,760
of the so-called AIDS acquisition files

261
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:49,970
and criticized public
demonstrations as anti-American.

262
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,198
Hello, Mr. Mayor.

263
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,041
Good to hear from you.

264
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,570
Just let me kiss you.

265
00:12:56,641 --> 00:12:58,224
I want to kiss you.

266
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,040
Yeah, Paul.

267
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:15,774
Great, send him in.

268
00:13:15,784 --> 00:13:16,797
Hey, Mel.

269
00:13:16,807 --> 00:13:17,630
How was Maine?

270
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,150
Oh, Maine is Maine.

271
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:19,983
How the hell are you?

272
00:13:19,993 --> 00:13:22,320
I hear the faggots been
knocking the hell out of you.

273
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,153
Let me see your noggin'.

274
00:13:23,163 --> 00:13:24,670
It's just a scratch, really.

275
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,930
I'm gonna milk it for all it's worth.

276
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,300
I'm gonna show these
little pieces of dog shit

277
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,570
they don't know who they're fucking with

278
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,570
when they're fucking with me.

279
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,958
I'll break their fucking legs.

280
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:34,920
These little faggots are really getting

281
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:37,070
way out of control, you know.

282
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,903
Thank you, Sam.

283
00:13:37,913 --> 00:13:39,684
Something has to be done about it.

284
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:41,200
I want you to know I saw
Hardigan the other day.

285
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:43,280
Ho, ho, ho, let me tell ya.

286
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,290
He looks terrible.

287
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,745
He was right out in the
street when they got him.

288
00:13:47,755 --> 00:13:48,578
Bam, bam.

289
00:13:48,588 --> 00:13:50,228
Yeah, but fucking Hardigan deserves that.

290
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,240
You got a point, there.

291
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,400
Listen, if we're gonna
get this bill through,

292
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:56,430
we've got to take care...

293
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,263
Thank you, Sam.

294
00:13:57,273 --> 00:13:58,777
Women's coalition.

295
00:13:58,787 --> 00:14:02,390
I have a few ideas about what
to do about the coalition,

296
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,460
however, I need your help.

297
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,470
I'm your man.

298
00:14:07,665 --> 00:14:09,248
Spare any change?

299
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:13,410
Can you spare any change, a dollar?

300
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,529
Spent 27% of New York City's hospital AIDS.

301
00:14:17,539 --> 00:14:21,030
No money, no beds, no staff, no treatment.

302
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,290
You shit.

303
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,771
Oh, you'll go to hell, that's right.

304
00:14:23,781 --> 00:14:25,413
I'm a black faggot, that's right,

305
00:14:25,423 --> 00:14:28,250
a fat, black faggot who's
gonna kick your fucking ass.

306
00:14:31,882 --> 00:14:33,139
Come on, come on with it.

307
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:35,286
I'm gonna kick your fucking ass right now.

308
00:14:35,296 --> 00:14:36,119
You come on, come on.

309
00:14:36,129 --> 00:14:37,609
Get the fuck out of our neighborhood.

310
00:14:39,394 --> 00:14:41,230
Oh, you think that shit was scary?

311
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:45,883
I'm Larvetta Larvon Lavicomtess Delarva.

312
00:14:47,794 --> 00:14:51,510
Mortals may address me as Larva

313
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,890
and I'm the only infected
person in the history of AIDS

314
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,530
who hasn't lost weight.

315
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,490
You better be scared.

316
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:34,339
Oh hi.

317
00:15:34,349 --> 00:15:35,268
Hey.

318
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:36,101
What?

319
00:15:36,111 --> 00:15:37,111
Look at you.

320
00:15:38,022 --> 00:15:38,845
Call me.

321
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,075
It's a little early for that, Max.

322
00:15:40,085 --> 00:15:41,720
Oh come on, but it makes me feel better.

323
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:42,810
Well, you look great.

324
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,643
Thank you.

325
00:15:43,653 --> 00:15:44,815
You see what he does to me?

326
00:15:44,825 --> 00:15:45,648
Great.

327
00:15:45,658 --> 00:15:49,060
Max, you gotta take better
care of yourself, Max.

328
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:51,930
Max, you take better care of yourself, oh!

329
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,990
Can you be serious for one minute, Max?

330
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,073
Max.

331
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:58,906
What?

332
00:15:58,916 --> 00:15:59,778
What's this money for?

333
00:15:59,788 --> 00:16:02,434
Oh, for my jewelries.

334
00:16:02,444 --> 00:16:03,267
Jewelries, no.

335
00:16:03,277 --> 00:16:05,227
Yes, no, 'cause I have no stones.

336
00:16:05,237 --> 00:16:06,434
Max.

337
00:16:06,444 --> 00:16:07,267
Okay, no.

338
00:16:07,277 --> 00:16:08,810
We gotta get more vodka.

339
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,750
No, no, no, Max.

340
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,670
Okay, okay, okay.

341
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,015
It's for rent and utilities.

342
00:16:12,025 --> 00:16:13,170
Rent and utilities, that's right.

343
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,003
Now promise.

344
00:16:14,013 --> 00:16:15,220
I promise, I swear...

345
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,310
I'll give it to Jamela next time.

346
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,200
I swear to Goddesses
I will pay it tomorrow.

347
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,165
Okay.

348
00:16:21,175 --> 00:16:21,998
Ow.

349
00:16:22,008 --> 00:16:22,831
See? See?

350
00:16:22,841 --> 00:16:23,850
You do feel bad.

351
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,860
What can I do?

352
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,070
Kiss me.

353
00:16:31,969 --> 00:16:33,010
Kiss you?

354
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,698
Mmm hmm.

355
00:16:39,681 --> 00:16:41,510
Is that better?

356
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,520
No.

357
00:16:43,637 --> 00:16:44,637
No?

358
00:16:45,317 --> 00:16:46,317
No.

359
00:16:51,683 --> 00:16:53,048
Now?

360
00:16:53,058 --> 00:16:54,543
Now.

361
00:16:54,553 --> 00:16:55,553
Now.

362
00:17:48,983 --> 00:17:49,983
Girl.

363
00:17:52,417 --> 00:17:53,834
You still got it.

364
00:17:55,477 --> 00:17:58,823
I don't know where you put it,

365
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,583
but you still got it.

366
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,400
Saw this woman today.

367
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,480
She was laying on the street

368
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,700
bleeding from her mouth.

369
00:18:31,496 --> 00:18:32,546
I wanted to help her.

370
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,570
She wouldn't let me.

371
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,380
I know she didn't try.

372
00:18:46,714 --> 00:18:47,960
I gave him the money.

373
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,370
She didn't try.

374
00:18:59,314 --> 00:19:00,560
'Cause I'm fab.

375
00:19:05,725 --> 00:19:06,725
Go, girl.

376
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:49,810
Oh Jesus Christ.

377
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,160
Why don't you go somewhere else with that?

378
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,650
You're making me sick already!

379
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,510
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

380
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,840
Kiss my ass!

381
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:58,230
What's the matter, Miss Dumb Pussy?

382
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,620
That trifling husband of yours

383
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,100
ain't slamming you right, lately?

384
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,037
Oh, yeah?

385
00:20:02,047 --> 00:20:03,140
And well maybe if you
kept your head on his dick

386
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,470
instead of outta that window you wouldn't

387
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,090
be so worried about
what's going on up here!

388
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,660
What do you know about my husband?

389
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:09,670
Here's a battery.

390
00:20:10,336 --> 00:20:11,330
Go get that vibrator of yours and stick it

391
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,969
in your stale pussy and rotate
the fuck out of my business!

392
00:20:14,979 --> 00:20:15,802
Oh, yeah?

393
00:20:15,812 --> 00:20:17,062
Well, fuck you!

394
00:20:22,269 --> 00:20:23,955
Oh, Miss Thing.

395
00:20:23,965 --> 00:20:27,210
Oh, you oughta read
Dear Abby, she's fierce.

396
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,750
I mean Erma Bombeck.

397
00:20:37,896 --> 00:20:39,480
This mother fucker gets back.

398
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,120
I'll be out in a minute, y'all.

399
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,810
I'm just using the.

400
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:04,589
Come on outta there now, child please.

401
00:21:19,096 --> 00:21:19,922
Yeah, that's right.

402
00:21:19,932 --> 00:21:23,015
your ass.

403
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,820
Yes!

404
00:21:29,624 --> 00:21:32,541
my ass.

405
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,940
New York City remains both fascinated

406
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:50,070
and outraged by the bizarre gay terrorists

407
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,340
who are ultimately
described by their victims

408
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:57,350
as ugly black women,
overdressed homos or freaks.

409
00:21:58,675 --> 00:22:00,820
This morning the police detained several

410
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,950
leaders of local gay activist groups

411
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,910
and although all denied
knowledge and responsibility

412
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,330
for the attacks, many pledged support

413
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,950
of the gay gang's activities.

414
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,720
Later, the mayor issued a city-wide alert

415
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,110
for the immediate apprehension of quote,

416
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,834
"This bunch of colored fags".

417
00:22:21,937 --> 00:22:26,450
♪ You can move on outta here ♪

418
00:22:46,223 --> 00:22:49,180
Oh, come on baby, what's the problem, huh?

419
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,690
What's the matter with you?

420
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,820
Come on, come on, come on.

421
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,450
This is supposed to be a celebration.

422
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,283
I know.

423
00:22:54,293 --> 00:22:55,600
Look, I got this great idea, you know?

424
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:58,650
I realize die and go on and our

425
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:01,620
ashes scattered over the
waters on Christopher Street.

426
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:05,413
You gonna be the next leader
of the Max Mo-Freak gang.

427
00:23:05,423 --> 00:23:06,610
Come on, what's the problem?

428
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,640
This is the problem here, Max.

429
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:11,427
Oh come on, this is my problem, not yours.

430
00:23:11,437 --> 00:23:12,430
Max.

431
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,400
This is good chicken.

432
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:14,550
Chicken, y'all had chicken?

433
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,240
Yeah well, Max made some quiche.

434
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,250
Oh, please.

435
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,000
You know I got an idea.

436
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:24,640
When we go back tonight, I'm
gonna send them for pizza

437
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:26,090
and they can stay out all night,

438
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,250
and we'll have our own
private celebration, okay?

439
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,788
Okay, just me and you, like it used to be.

440
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:32,420
Max.

441
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,480
That time he made apple quiche

442
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:36,200
and had the nerve to tell us he made it.

443
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,740
He had the nerve to fix
his face talking about

444
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,671
he made pork and bean quiche, oh please.

445
00:23:45,795 --> 00:23:48,750
I don't wanna talk
about death anymore, Max.

446
00:23:51,259 --> 00:23:52,459
I wanna talk about life.

447
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,530
Life, and...

448
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,363
Max.

449
00:23:55,373 --> 00:23:56,196
What's, what's...

450
00:23:56,206 --> 00:23:59,280
They're doing great things
with research now, Max.

451
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,560
You don't have to die.

452
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:02,680
Oh, well wait a minute.

453
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:03,770
Stop the presses.

454
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,040
Walk me cross the water.

455
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:07,320
You're gonna step down from
your pedestal of 21 years

456
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:09,060
to tell me that they're
doing research to save my...

457
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,545
I hate it when you
talk to me that way, Max.

458
00:24:10,555 --> 00:24:12,360
No, no, they're doing
research to save my tired life?

459
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,470
What, have you been talking
to your friends in college?

460
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,600
Look at the way you talk to people.

461
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:16,890
That's the only way I get things done, Sam.

462
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,640
How many times do I have
to tell that to you?

463
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:19,750
You're wrong, you're wrong!

464
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,583
You've seen what's going on.

465
00:24:20,593 --> 00:24:21,930
They're not doing anything for me

466
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:22,763
or your friends at college.

467
00:24:22,773 --> 00:24:23,987
All the sudden it's about research.

468
00:24:23,997 --> 00:24:24,820
No, no, not my friends...

469
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,150
And oh, they're gonna do
something for Marmalade,

470
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,270
any of us down here.

471
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,810
Oh, Sam come on.

472
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,850
Y'all want some barbecue?

473
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,911
In the house?

474
00:24:35,744 --> 00:24:36,567
You're brighter than that.

475
00:24:36,577 --> 00:24:37,400
Max, I'm tired of it.

476
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,233
I don't wanna do this anymore.

477
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:39,173
Look, I'm tired of this conversation.

478
00:24:39,183 --> 00:24:40,183
Max!

479
00:24:41,126 --> 00:24:42,540
Max, I'm sick of you.

480
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:45,182
I'm sick of the way you do things.

481
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,015
I'm sick of the...

482
00:24:46,025 --> 00:24:47,530
No, no, no, I'm sick.

483
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,020
And I'm healthy.

484
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,200
I'm healthy.

Do you like them?

Sure.

494
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,560
I like them.

495
00:26:25,366 --> 00:26:30,366
Do you like them, or
do you really like them?

I really like them.

Do you want some more?

498
00:26:47,697 --> 00:26:48,697
Yes.

499
00:26:55,639 --> 00:26:56,806
Six o'clock.

500
00:26:58,043 --> 00:26:59,043
There.

501
00:27:01,816 --> 00:27:03,733
I'll get you some more.

502
00:27:11,181 --> 00:27:12,181
Six o'clock.

503
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,860
Thank you.

504
00:27:36,794 --> 00:27:39,553
You seem to be a bit uncomfortable.

505
00:27:39,563 --> 00:27:40,563
No.

506
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:43,369
I hope I'm not making you afraid of me.

507
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,980
I like to think that we
have a lot in common.

508
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,790
Okay.

509
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,100
I want you to be
completely at ease with me.

510
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:56,615
I'm sorry.

511
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:58,625
Don't apologize.

512
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:06,530
Aren't you afraid?

513
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,710
I mean, to be seen in public with me?

514
00:28:10,604 --> 00:28:13,586
I'd be proud to be seen anywhere with you.

515
00:28:17,179 --> 00:28:19,139
That's the stupidest
thing that I've ever heard.

516
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,642
It is pretty stupid, Sam.

517
00:28:22,652 --> 00:28:23,652
Yeah.

518
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,530
Okay, now it's your turn.

519
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,440
You get to say something stupid to me.

520
00:28:33,911 --> 00:28:35,560
I can't think of anything.

521
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,085
I'm so bored with city council.

522
00:28:39,095 --> 00:28:41,590
You know I've been on city
council for ten years now?

523
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,370
I was elected when I was 25 years old.

524
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,160
There's nothing left for me now.

525
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:51,450
I have my sights set on bigger things.

526
00:28:52,629 --> 00:28:53,629
President?

527
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,470
No one wants to be President, Sam.

528
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,890
Presidents don't make enough
money for what they do.

529
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,840
No, I'm running for Congress.

530
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:06,560
Yeah, the mayor, party, the owe me a lot.

531
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,800
I've done a lot for
them the past few years.

532
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:10,630
I'm gonna call in a few chits.

533
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,660
I really think that I'm ready for it

534
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:15,755
and I have all the
contacts to make it work.

535
00:29:15,765 --> 00:29:16,765
I think so, too.

536
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,000
When I get down to Washington,

537
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:24,700
I'd like to have you there with me.

538
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,970
I think we could find a place for you.

539
00:29:32,048 --> 00:29:32,922
Really?

540
00:29:32,932 --> 00:29:34,015
Yeah.

541
00:29:37,055 --> 00:29:38,138
Doing what?

542
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,580
Doesn't matter, really.

543
00:29:42,516 --> 00:29:45,266
I'd just like to have you around.

544
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,720
That's really corny.

545
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,040
That's two corny things from me.

546
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:53,353
You get to say one.

547
00:29:53,363 --> 00:29:55,340
You can tell me one corny thing.

548
00:30:02,775 --> 00:30:05,660
Your eyes like two huge...

549
00:30:11,479 --> 00:30:13,229
Okay, okay, you're excused.

550
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,295
We believe the government is acquiring

551
00:30:17,305 --> 00:30:22,305
names and numbers of
all HIV positive people

552
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:23,540
in New York City.

553
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:27,100
We can't prove it yet...

554
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:31,239
The AIDS acquisition
files, you heard of them?

555
00:30:31,249 --> 00:30:32,072
Uh huh.

556
00:30:32,082 --> 00:30:34,230
So, you want the government
knowing who you are,

557
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,850
and where you are and who you
fucking, when you fucking,

558
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:41,040
what your HIV status is even before you do?

559
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:42,500
Hell no.

560
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,087
To the death.

561
00:30:44,097 --> 00:30:45,847
To the death.

562
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:54,684
What's this?

563
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,293
The AIDS crisis is not over.

564
00:31:07,303 --> 00:31:10,740
The discrimination impact
let the record show.

565
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,420
For legislative AIDS trials against

566
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:15,140
children of color and
children without color.

567
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:16,941
Councilman Eddie Hicks.

568
00:31:16,951 --> 00:31:17,820
Guilty.

569
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:20,410
University Hospital
President T. Warden Cropp.

570
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,250
Guilty.

571
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,960
Sister Mary Clarence.

572
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:23,793
Guilty.

573
00:31:23,803 --> 00:31:26,640
Commissioner what's his name?

574
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:27,473
Guilty.

575
00:31:27,483 --> 00:31:29,511
Councilman Melvin Freeman.

576
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:30,458
Guilty.

577
00:31:30,468 --> 00:31:33,100
Fight to the death, my
children, to the death.

578
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:33,933
Ghetto.

579
00:31:33,943 --> 00:31:37,390
Before we start, I want to ask something.

580
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,410
Last week I pushed very hard to organize

581
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,730
a nice political reception for us

582
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,790
with pizza and performances and such

583
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,430
and I got the go ahead
to do the groundwork,

584
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,480
then come to find out you
ordered the idea to be killed.

585
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,030
Now, what I wanna know is why should I

586
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,890
spend time at these
meetings giving all this

587
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,050
creative input when you go ahead and do

588
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,600
whatever the hell you feel like?

589
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:04,580
I have better things to do with my time.

590
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,920
I could have been sucking dick.

591
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:07,530
Don't y'all know who I am?

592
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:10,567
I am Larvetta Larvon Lavicomtess Delarva

593
00:32:10,577 --> 00:32:11,660
and I will be heard.

594
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:14,851
Shut it down, shut it down.

595
00:32:14,861 --> 00:32:18,260
And I'm sick of having
to work in an opium den.

596
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:21,100
I'm trying to bring you
people up to a new level.

597
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:22,870
Will you just relax?

598
00:32:26,084 --> 00:32:27,550
Maybe you're right.

599
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,190
Maybe I better just take
my aristocratic black ass

600
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,050
back to my chateau to be
served flawlessly by my...

601
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,290
Ta ta ta ta.

602
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,300
Maybe you'd better.

603
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:37,983
Next.

604
00:32:39,225 --> 00:32:40,048
Bitch.

605
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:40,900
Ghetto.

606
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,450
Answer the fucking question.

607
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,840
Are you in or out?

608
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:45,540
Use your brain, it's not hard.

609
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,643
I'm in.

610
00:32:46,653 --> 00:32:48,490
I just don't wanna go to jail.

611
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,720
I'm a songstress.

612
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:50,610
She's out.

613
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,000
I'm not out.

614
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:54,460
In fact, I was in long before

615
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,440
you even showed up, Foxy Brown.

616
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:57,440
Watch it.

617
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:59,060
Cleopatra Jones.

618
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,330
Watch what?

619
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,530
Who are we supposed to watch?

620
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,030
And who's watching the watchers?

621
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,410
Joan, please.

622
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,630
I just don't wanna go to jail.

623
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,090
Are you on?

624
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:08,923
Fuck you.

625
00:33:08,933 --> 00:33:09,800
No, are you on?

626
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:11,480
It's a simple question.

627
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,120
Are you on?

628
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:14,700
I don't gotta put up with this shit.

629
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,850
I'm a woman of substance.

630
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,170
I ain't judging you.

631
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,000
I just wanna know.

632
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:21,070
Are you on?

633
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,580
Well?

634
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:26,980
Marmalade is a warrior.

635
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:28,900
Marmalade is fearless.

636
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,580
Marmalade is an addict.

637
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,900
So are a lot of people.

638
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,594
We all got issues, Miss Shenequa

639
00:33:41,604 --> 00:33:44,760
and you can't lay them all out on me.

640
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:48,800
I am an addict, baby,
but I am not the problem.

641
00:33:50,057 --> 00:33:52,570
Besides, I have nowhere to go.

642
00:33:55,507 --> 00:33:59,801
Addict.

643
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,850
Ghetto.

644
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,420
Come on guys.

645
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:07,510
Freeman is big in the
AIDS acquisition scam,

646
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,762
I can just feel it.

647
00:34:08,772 --> 00:34:09,750
You can just feel it?

648
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,185
If we kidnap him and bring him here,

649
00:34:11,195 --> 00:34:13,770
we could force information
or blackmail him.

650
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,603
With what?

651
00:34:14,613 --> 00:34:15,940
I don't wanna get shot.

652
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,220
You have no proof.

653
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,190
I do nothing without proof, Sam.

654
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,730
Freeman really trusts me now.

655
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,280
Trusts you'd go right to jail.

656
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:23,320
I don't wanna get jail.

657
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:24,910
Not if we do it right.

658
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,020
Why are we still talking about this?

659
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:28,130
You can flap your wings
all you want, honey.

660
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,190
It ain't gonna fly.

661
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,500
What are we talking about?

662
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:33,650
We're not big medical doctors
with psychological degrees.

663
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:36,462
We limited queens who can
barely finish a manicure.

664
00:34:36,472 --> 00:34:37,295
Speak for yourself.

665
00:34:37,305 --> 00:34:38,660
What the fuck are we gonna do with Freeman?

666
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:39,850
Freeman has different sides.

667
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:40,780
I've seen it.

668
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:41,830
Different sides.

669
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,663
Oh, yeah?

670
00:34:42,673 --> 00:34:43,496
Well, what if he resists?

671
00:34:43,506 --> 00:34:44,779
We'd have to beat him up.

672
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,180
Oh, don't worry.

673
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:49,290
Sam can just monologue him to death.

674
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,690
You've all got no respect.

675
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,960
No respect for me as a gay Asian militant.

676
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,300
When we first met you, you were

677
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:59,930
a closeted apolitical Oriental.

678
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,230
So big deal about my life.

679
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,680
You've still got no respect.

680
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:05,680
What have you been doing in that office?

681
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:06,750
Have you blown it?

682
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,900
No.

683
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:08,920
Well, what have you done?

684
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:09,900
Nothing.

685
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:11,590
Yes you have.

686
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,100
You've done something.

687
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,690
Stop it.

688
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,840
You too young to be scheming up shit.

689
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:17,673
I'm young?

690
00:35:17,683 --> 00:35:18,600
Yes.

691
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:22,310
Now, if you refuse to
present evidence and refuse

692
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,205
to cite sources...

693
00:35:23,215 --> 00:35:24,038
Max!

694
00:35:24,048 --> 00:35:26,080
I refuse to address the issue any further.

695
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,090
So that's it?

696
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:29,110
We're not even gonna try?

697
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,880
I thought you guys were badasses.

698
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:33,790
To the death.

699
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,970
Yes, but not a silly death, Sammy.

700
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,750
I really don't need your help, you know.

701
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,800
Dorothy, please.

702
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:39,920
I've got my own shit.

703
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,240
Bull fagga jones shit.

704
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,120
And I'm cool with it.

705
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:43,490
Well, sister, if you got your own shit

706
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,360
and you're cool with it, that just means

707
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:47,620
you have cool shit, now don't it?

708
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,453
Next!

709
00:35:48,463 --> 00:35:49,463
Da da!

710
00:35:51,586 --> 00:35:53,840
Ooh, she's so funny.

711
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:55,745
Gorgeous, but funny.

712
00:35:57,966 --> 00:35:58,789
Ghetto.

713
00:35:58,799 --> 00:35:59,622
I'm sorry.

714
00:35:59,632 --> 00:36:01,220
I thought we were a self-proclaimed

715
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:04,120
queer terrorist group
dedicated to queer terrorism.

716
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:05,060
We are.

717
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,540
So why should I expend energy on some

718
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:08,360
abortion clinic dealing with tired fish

719
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:10,330
pollyannas who wanna kill their kid?

720
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:13,050
No, see but I have the
right to control my body.

721
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:16,099
So control your body by not fucking.

722
00:36:16,109 --> 00:36:17,120
What?

723
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:20,080
I said control your body by not fucking

724
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,150
and face the consequences of your actions.

725
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,334
Pregnancy is a consequence?

726
00:36:24,344 --> 00:36:25,167
Yep.

727
00:36:25,177 --> 00:36:26,340
Is rape a consequence?

728
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,460
Is AIDS a consequence?

729
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:29,840
AIDS is not comparable to baby making.

730
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:32,060
If a woman gets herself pregnant.

731
00:36:33,135 --> 00:36:36,430
I wanna know how a woman
gets herself pregnant.

732
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,980
If she opens up her legs then that's

733
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:39,813
what's gonna happen.

734
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:41,958
She gonna get herself
pregnant now ain't it?

735
00:36:41,968 --> 00:36:43,252
LaLarva.

736
00:36:43,262 --> 00:36:44,570
La victim.

737
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:48,070
Abort all the babies you
want, just call it murder.

738
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,000
Call it murder!

739
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:52,840
Step off, Betty, step the fuck off.

740
00:36:54,338 --> 00:36:56,160
Are you ever here?

741
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,133
Ever?

742
00:36:58,143 --> 00:36:59,810
Here, on this planet with us?

743
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,560
Divide and conquer.

744
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:04,310
That's how it always falls.

745
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,800
You are why every revolution has failed.

746
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:08,740
Me? I...

747
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:09,600
Yes, you.

748
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:10,433
I am the cause?

749
00:37:10,443 --> 00:37:11,560
You.

750
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,306
For why every single revolution...

751
00:37:13,316 --> 00:37:14,139
Yes, you...

752
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:14,972
Has failed?

753
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:16,416
Big house momma, sitting
up here trying not to...

754
00:37:16,426 --> 00:37:18,010
Look, come and get your bitch, okay?

755
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,328
No, you come for me.

756
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:20,580
You come for me, okay?

757
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:21,413
I'm ready.

758
00:37:21,423 --> 00:37:24,801
Would y'all please shut up!

759
00:37:24,811 --> 00:37:26,410
Jesus fucking H Chri...

760
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,820
I swear I hate every last one of you.

761
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,940
You, you, you, you, you, you.

762
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,530
You, ya big cocoon mother fucker.

763
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,870
And you, twist your wig and maybe

764
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,040
you can think straight, okay?

765
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:37,550
And would you stop writing
all this goddamn shit down?

766
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,250
And Sam fix your piercing and get a clone.

767
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,030
Jesus fucking Christ.

768
00:37:45,891 --> 00:37:48,090
Uh oh, out of liquor.

769
00:37:56,879 --> 00:37:58,129
Hey, hey Pedro.

770
00:37:59,725 --> 00:38:00,591
Jose!

771
00:38:00,601 --> 00:38:01,833
Get your friends and come on up.

772
00:38:01,843 --> 00:38:02,725
We having a party.

773
00:38:02,735 --> 00:38:03,766
Ooh, look at that one.

774
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,770
Shut the fuck up.

775
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,810
looking for him.

776
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:06,643
Ooh, which one?

777
00:38:06,653 --> 00:38:08,373
The one with the dick swinging in the wind.

778
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,183
He was what?

779
00:38:10,193 --> 00:38:12,609
He was sucking that man's dick yesterday.

780
00:38:12,619 --> 00:38:13,442
Stop.

781
00:38:13,452 --> 00:38:14,275
Oh, yes.

782
00:38:14,285 --> 00:38:15,238
I love me a less giving it man.

783
00:38:15,248 --> 00:38:17,890
Oh worship that.

784
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,086
In the name of the father,
the son, that holy thing.

785
00:38:20,096 --> 00:38:21,430
You better stop here with me.

786
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,527
Come on baby.

787
00:38:22,537 --> 00:38:23,360
Stop it right now.

788
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:24,193
Oh!

789
00:38:24,203 --> 00:38:25,026
Oh please, holy Mary mother of dick.

790
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:25,859
Oh please, the only
reason I hang out with you

791
00:38:25,869 --> 00:38:27,200
is light-skinning it.

792
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:28,033
You didn't go there.

793
00:38:28,043 --> 00:38:28,937
Oh, yes I did.

794
00:38:28,947 --> 00:38:29,770
You shouldn't.

795
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:30,603
But you know I did.

796
00:38:30,613 --> 00:38:31,436
You better never do it again.

797
00:38:31,446 --> 00:38:32,446
Oh, what you gonna do?

798
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,180
Yeah, y'all come waaa!

799
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,630
He's the devil.

800
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,310
Larva is the devil.

801
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,550
He's lonely.

802
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,383
He's angry, he's hurting.

803
00:38:42,393 --> 00:38:43,510
He's obviously lonely.

804
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,580
No, Sam, Larva is the devil.

805
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:47,413
Look at him.

806
00:38:47,423 --> 00:38:48,840
He's deeply disturbed.

807
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:50,380
Look what he's doing to Max.

808
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:51,213
He's disruptive.

809
00:38:51,223 --> 00:38:54,460
Have you noticed we don't
have one plan for next week?

810
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:56,840
I'm not gonna spend another
day in his presence.

811
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:59,110
They are just too old for me, anyway.

812
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,920
I like my men young, light-skinned

813
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:04,690
and so dumb they can even spell commitment.

814
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,790
Isn't it a little late in the day

815
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,090
to be so goddamn color struck?

816
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,370
Why?

817
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,300
To uplift the race.

818
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,133
Oh child please.

819
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,600
The race'll do fine without me.

820
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:17,560
My preferences are a part of who I am

821
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:19,500
and I will not apologize.

822
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:21,990
Now I loves my black people.

823
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
But I loves me, ooh, a light-skinned man.

824
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:29,170
Don't go there.

825
00:39:30,767 --> 00:39:31,610
Why don't you just let the child

826
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,320
make up his own mind already?

827
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:34,330
Come on, Sam.

828
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,250
Oh, Fernando.

829
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,832
Better yell a little harder.

830
00:39:38,842 --> 00:39:40,259
Fernando.

831
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:42,450
Larva.

832
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,150
Samuel.

833
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,760
Will you marry me?

834
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,260
Where's the ring?

835
00:39:54,469 --> 00:39:55,339
I lost it.

836
00:39:55,349 --> 00:39:57,499
You can't marry the Larva without a ring.

837
00:39:59,421 --> 00:40:00,582
But I won't tell Max.

838
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:03,120
Marriage ha!

839
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,950
The last time I heard
that it was from Raoul.

840
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,590
He was the one that infected me.

841
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,520
Gangster bitch mother fucker Raoul.

842
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:13,810
I know you did it.

843
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,063
I know.

844
00:40:15,073 --> 00:40:16,890
How can you be sure?

845
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:17,900
I'm sure.

846
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,610
Besides, Raoul was too
smitten by your vicomtess.

847
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:26,160
Too smitten as it should be.

848
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:29,260
Oh, he was dumb, dumb!

849
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:33,500
Couldn't write, couldn't read.

850
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:35,080
Couldn't spell dick.

851
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,470
But he sure did know how to work one.

852
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,320
Lord have mercy.

853
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:46,250
He could say ooh.

854
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,430
Then he would just pull his teeth

855
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,782
out of his mouth.

856
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,440
Oh.

857
00:40:56,510 --> 00:41:01,320
Now who's gonna marry a
fat, ugly, disease-ridden

858
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:03,180
bag like myself?

859
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:06,700
Fame, fortune and a title to boot.

860
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,170
But I fear your vicomtess

861
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,670
will die waiting for the vicomdale.

862
00:41:15,536 --> 00:41:16,786
I know, I know.

863
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:55,350
Just what?

864
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,810
Oh, you kiss my mother fuck...

865
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,410
Fuck you Sam.

866
00:42:01,668 --> 00:42:04,829
♪ I wanna see you ♪

867
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:07,815
♪ When I'm leaving ♪

868
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:11,046
♪ 'Cause I'm leaving ♪

869
00:42:11,056 --> 00:42:12,223
You alright?

870
00:42:14,275 --> 00:42:16,710
You know, Sam, I got this brilliant idea.

871
00:42:18,166 --> 00:42:18,989
Let's go away.

872
00:42:18,999 --> 00:42:21,270
Let's get the fuck outta
here, just me and you.

873
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,400
I don't want them around.

874
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:24,770
We'll go to Jamaica.

875
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:28,020
You know, I know this, there's this beach.

876
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,780
It's a villa, I don't know where it is

877
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:32,290
but we can find it, you know?

878
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:37,300
And it's got sand, like
snow in August it's so white

879
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:43,100
and blue water and oh, man, me and you

880
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:46,030
could be on the beach, just me and you,

881
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:49,662
like we used to be.

882
00:42:49,672 --> 00:42:54,672
I just want to be honest, I
just want to suck your dick.

883
00:42:54,809 --> 00:42:55,809
Max.

884
00:43:04,345 --> 00:43:05,345
Boo!

885
00:43:08,158 --> 00:43:10,780
Who the fuck you think
you blowing off, huh?

886
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:14,040
I'm Max Mo-Freak.

887
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:20,530
You little fucking geisha
girl Suzy Wong bitch.

888
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,840
Why don't you take your ass
back on the fucking boat

889
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:27,060
to them damn rice fields?

890
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:30,160
I been doing more shit than when

891
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:33,920
you were little with your
little tiny fucking feet bound.

892
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:37,940
You don't know who you're fucking with.

893
00:43:39,466 --> 00:43:40,466
Shit.

894
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,427
Not with that nigger.

895
00:44:06,437 --> 00:44:07,758
Not in there.

896
00:44:09,705 --> 00:44:11,364
I'm trying to save her life, goddammit.

897
00:44:11,374 --> 00:44:12,723
Save my life, mind your goddamn business.

898
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:13,980
What, oh now that you can't get no ass

899
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:16,271
you gotta find someone else to shoot up?

900
00:44:22,265 --> 00:44:24,515
Break it up, break it up.

901
00:44:26,858 --> 00:44:27,858
What's your problem?

902
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,080
Don't you push me.

903
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:34,000
I'm so tired.

904
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:35,380
Get off of me, Sam.

905
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:36,798
You tired?

906
00:44:36,808 --> 00:44:37,780
I'm so tired of this.

907
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:41,600
I'm so tired of you wasting
your life away with this...

908
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:42,762
What the fuck is wrong with dreaming?

909
00:44:42,772 --> 00:44:43,595
This dream of yours.

910
00:44:43,605 --> 00:44:44,428
Oh, oh.

911
00:44:44,438 --> 00:44:46,380
And you're doing it all wrong.

912
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:47,250
Look at you.

913
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:48,620
You coming down off your pedestal

914
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:50,460
of your self-righteousness
to say we doing it wrong.

915
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:51,930
You wasting your time?

916
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,060
Is that it?

917
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:54,310
Yeah, I'm wasting my time.

918
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,100
I don't have that much time.

919
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,750
Max, you know I don't have that much time.

920
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,882
I know to the death, to the death, huh?

921
00:45:00,892 --> 00:45:02,414
So, what to the death when it's convenient?

922
00:45:02,424 --> 00:45:03,247
Huh?

923
00:45:03,257 --> 00:45:04,080
I don't wanna kill myself, though.

924
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:05,200
going away?

925
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:08,261
I don't wanna watch you kill yourself!

926
00:45:08,271 --> 00:45:10,441
How can you stand here and watch...

927
00:45:10,451 --> 00:45:11,907
Don't sit here and preach to me!

928
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:14,761
Don't sit here and preach to me.

929
00:45:14,771 --> 00:45:15,594
How can you...

930
00:45:15,604 --> 00:45:16,427
You're wasting your time, huh?

931
00:45:16,437 --> 00:45:17,962
Is that what you're telling me?

932
00:45:17,972 --> 00:45:19,160
Y'all are a lost cause.

933
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:20,610
Revolution's over, huh?

934
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:23,270
That what you telling me?

935
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,470
You done, huh?

936
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,090
All the marching, all them women out there

937
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,940
with their babies, huh?

938
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:30,140
With their babies, that's over, right?

939
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,630
'Cause you wasting your time

940
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,381
and we ain't doing what
you want us to do, huh?

941
00:45:36,391 --> 00:45:37,600
'Cause everything ain't right.

942
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:38,433
Everything ain't Jamela's way?

943
00:45:38,443 --> 00:45:39,851
Max, no, it's not like that!

944
00:45:39,861 --> 00:45:43,940
I just can't watch you kill yourself.

945
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:45,000
Then, you know what then?

946
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:48,190
Hey, hey, Jamela, hey, fuck off.

947
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,737
Fuck off, okay?

948
00:45:51,747 --> 00:45:52,570
Is that the way you want it?

949
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:53,580
Yeah.

950
00:45:54,491 --> 00:45:55,314
I won't waste your time.

951
00:45:55,324 --> 00:45:57,524
I don't wanna do anything
that's gonna inconvenience you.

952
00:45:57,534 --> 00:45:59,240
You know, we ain't perfect.

953
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:00,073
'Cause that's the way you want it.

954
00:46:00,083 --> 00:46:00,906
Jamela, fuck off.

955
00:46:00,916 --> 00:46:02,560
Fuck off!

956
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:05,100
I been taking care of
you for 30 years, Max.

957
00:46:07,434 --> 00:46:09,767
I don't need no preaching.

958
00:46:11,174 --> 00:46:13,174
Don't need no preaching.

959
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,560
Fuck off.

960
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:19,190
Hmm?

961
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,830
Max, now that that's over

962
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,400
can we go get my shit now?

963
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:35,110
Max.

964
00:46:38,851 --> 00:46:39,680
Gonna go get it now?

965
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:40,832
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

966
00:46:40,842 --> 00:46:41,665
We're gonna go get your shit.

967
00:46:41,675 --> 00:46:43,285
We're gonna go, alright?

968
00:46:43,295 --> 00:46:44,118
Gonna get it now?

969
00:46:44,128 --> 00:46:44,951
Yeah, let me think.

970
00:46:44,961 --> 00:46:46,250
Alright, alright.

971
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:47,560
Where that bottle of
vodka I left around here?

972
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:48,750
I drank it.

973
00:46:50,509 --> 00:46:51,828
Okay.

974
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:02,940
It's me.

975
00:47:05,316 --> 00:47:06,647
I know.

976
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,657
I'm one of them.

977
00:47:09,715 --> 00:47:10,538
I know.

978
00:47:10,548 --> 00:47:11,507
You've gotta go now.

979
00:47:11,517 --> 00:47:13,336
They're on their way.

980
00:47:13,346 --> 00:47:14,207
You've gotta go.

981
00:47:14,217 --> 00:47:16,038
Don't make me go.

982
00:47:18,958 --> 00:47:19,857
Stop that.

983
00:47:19,867 --> 00:47:22,995
I don't want you to get hurt.

984
00:47:23,005 --> 00:47:25,255
Let me stay.

985
00:47:25,265 --> 00:47:26,598
Can you?

986
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:29,930
I love you.

987
00:47:32,405 --> 00:47:33,488
Yeah?

988
00:47:36,017 --> 00:47:37,017
Yeah?

989
00:48:02,939 --> 00:48:04,969
Oh, I ain't done.

990
00:48:04,979 --> 00:48:06,450
I guess I could sing
for you mother fuckers.

991
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:07,480
I mean, people, now.

992
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,004
Oh, I got a little ditty.

993
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:14,030
You get that, ditty?

994
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,260
Fuck you.

995
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:18,090
I'm gonna give you a little ditty

996
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:21,350

Y'all ain't getting no
more outta me tonight.

1010
00:48:59,889 --> 00:49:00,889
I'm tired.

1011
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:03,740
And the band gotta go pee.

1012
00:49:05,363 --> 00:49:07,620
Oh, how y'all doing?

1013
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:09,399
The little people.

1014
00:49:09,409 --> 00:49:10,238
Hi.

1015
00:49:10,248 --> 00:49:11,408
Who's that big bitch there?

1016
00:49:12,905 --> 00:49:15,308
Alright wait a minute, wait, wait.

1017
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:17,423
Wait a minute.

1018
00:49:17,433 --> 00:49:18,256
Oh, help me up.

1019
00:49:18,266 --> 00:49:19,440
Oh what you got baby?

1020
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:20,480
stomach, I got stuff.

1021
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:21,749
cheap, got a little cheap.

1022
00:49:21,759 --> 00:49:22,759
Okay.

1023
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:24,653
You got the words.

1024
00:49:24,663 --> 00:49:27,983
Ooh, we gonna go have ourselves some fun.

1025
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:31,590
I'll be back to sing.

1026
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,066
She'll be right back, okay?

1027
00:49:33,076 --> 00:49:34,576
Be right back.

1028
00:49:34,586 --> 00:49:35,905
Trying to steal my thunder?

1029
00:49:35,915 --> 00:49:37,551
Let's go, alright?

1030
00:49:37,561 --> 00:49:40,316
Okay, we gonna be back in a minute.

1031
00:49:41,443 --> 00:49:42,810
Just like a lady.

1032
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:49,960
Max...

1033
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:56,506
Hey.

1034
00:49:56,516 --> 00:49:57,643
Shh.

1035
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:02,988
Get off of me.

1036
00:50:02,998 --> 00:50:03,821
How can you think of that?

1037
00:50:03,831 --> 00:50:05,080
We're in serious trouble.

1038
00:50:05,090 --> 00:50:06,260
I thought these were your friends.

1039
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:08,620
I know but they're nuts.

1040
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:11,100
Capable of anything, gotta think.

1041
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:12,600
Don't let me stop you.

1042
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:14,490
This is for your sake.

1043
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,500
Thank you.

1044
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:18,950
Hey, is the bald one your boyfriend?

1045
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:22,900
He is your boyfriend.

1046
00:50:23,878 --> 00:50:24,701
Shut up.

1047
00:50:24,711 --> 00:50:26,020
I thought you said you
were so pure and innocent.

1048
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:26,853
Shh shh, please stop it.

1049
00:50:26,863 --> 00:50:28,790
This could be the end of
your political career.

1050
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,232
Not with you on the case.

1051
00:50:31,242 --> 00:50:32,242
Oh God.

1052
00:50:34,259 --> 00:50:35,133
Hey Sam.

1053
00:50:35,143 --> 00:50:36,143
What?

1054
00:50:37,810 --> 00:50:38,810
Do you love me?

1055
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,280
What?

1056
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:44,310
Brunch is served.

1057
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:54,900
Why is he still blindfolded?

1058
00:50:54,910 --> 00:50:57,240
So he can't see where we are.

1059
00:50:58,192 --> 00:51:02,390
Actually, we took a cab here,

1060
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,030
so I know where we are.

1061
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:10,140
I think I should speak.

1062
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,530
Melvin here, he's not quite the person

1063
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:15,540
we thought he was.

1064
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,110
He's actually a very special person.

1065
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,630
He's forced to do things he hates.

1066
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:23,190
I mean, that whole AIDS hospice...

1067
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,360
See, my thoughts on the
AIDS hospice is simply this:

1068
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:28,940
why should we allow them to force another

1069
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:30,500
AIDS hospice on this community?

1070
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,200
We're not the only place
in the city that has AIDS.

1071
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:35,070
They have AIDS on the upper east side.

1072
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,230
Nobody's trying to force an
AIDS hospice down their throat.

1073
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,530
They have AIDS down in Battery Park City.

1074
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:40,710
Nobody's trying to give
them an AIDS hospice.

1075
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,800
You see, the more we allow them to turn

1076
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:47,010
this community into a AIDS ghetto,

1077
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,880
a dumping ground for people with AIDS,

1078
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:50,590
it takes away from our ability to serve

1079
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:51,760
other people in other ways.

1080
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:56,660
I mean, what about day care
and housing, senior citizens?

1081
00:51:56,670 --> 00:52:01,670
And there are other ways
to serve people with AIDS.

1082
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:03,700
You know, we didn't cause this disease.

1083
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:06,410
Why should we have to bear the brunt of it?

1084
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:10,200
Melvin's gonna help us get
the AIDS acquisition files.

1085
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:11,510
But you have to trust him.

1086
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:13,540
You have to trust me.

1087
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:17,090
Max?

1088
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:19,640
Max, what do you say, Max?

1089
00:52:35,474 --> 00:52:38,898
Suck my dick mother fucker.

1090
00:52:38,908 --> 00:52:39,890
Suck my dick.

1091
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,192
Yeah, yeah.

1092
00:52:41,202 --> 00:52:42,532
You're a sick person, Max.

1093
00:52:42,542 --> 00:52:43,563
You're a sick person.

1094
00:52:43,573 --> 00:52:44,563
Oh damn.

1095
00:52:44,573 --> 00:52:46,770
You should be a doctor.

1096
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:50,835
You have this fucking
fantastic diagnostic ability.

1097
00:52:55,283 --> 00:52:56,106
Let me get this player.

1098
00:52:56,116 --> 00:52:57,300
Come on, Freddie, give me a player.

1099
00:52:57,310 --> 00:52:58,430
Come on, let's go.

1100
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:59,263
I want to hear, I'm all ears.

1101
00:52:59,273 --> 00:53:01,186
I'm all ears mother fucker.

1102
00:53:01,196 --> 00:53:02,529
All ears.

1103
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:14,580
Max, please.

1104
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:16,420
Bitch, it's left goddammit, left.

1105
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:18,590
I know when I'm right,
Lawrence and it's right.

1106
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,200
Don't you dare go there.

1107
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:21,158
How dare you speak to your

1108
00:53:21,168 --> 00:53:22,000
vicomtess like that?

1109
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:23,410
It's left, you bitch.

1110
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:24,970
And where's your glasses?

1111
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:26,480
You can't see worth a damn.

1112
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:28,490
When was the last time
you were up in Harlem,

1113
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:31,020
Miss I'm Wearing My Knockoff
Donna Karan sunglasses.

1114
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:32,580
Don't you dare go there.

1115
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:35,320
It's left, goddammit, left.

1116
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:36,153
Where are we?

1117
00:53:36,163 --> 00:53:36,986
Max.

1118
00:53:36,996 --> 00:53:38,062
Please.

1119
00:53:38,072 --> 00:53:39,021
Would you shut the fuck up?

1120
00:53:39,031 --> 00:53:40,050
What?

1121
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:41,060
Where are we?

1122
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,320
Oh.

1123
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:48,750
You were right, I'm sorry.

1124
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,160
Sorry?

1125
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:52,060
Well, how sorry do you want me to be?

1126
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:54,137
Didn't you call me bitch?

1127
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:54,970
I'm sorry.

1128
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:56,160
Well, it's just that your "I'm sorry"

1129
00:53:56,170 --> 00:53:58,780
is so much less emphatic than your "bitch".

1130
00:53:59,779 --> 00:54:02,080
Where is my chiffon scarf?

1131
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:07,800
No, Kappa girls are alright.

1132
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:09,800
It's those Gammas you gotta watch out for.

1133
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:12,380
Wait, wasn't it a Kappa who wrote

1134
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:13,919
an article in Essence magazine about

1135
00:54:13,929 --> 00:54:16,970
black women having to share black men?

1136
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:17,803
What?

1137
00:54:17,813 --> 00:54:18,636
No, seriously.

1138
00:54:18,646 --> 00:54:20,960
Apparently there's this
shortage of black men

1139
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:22,920
so us black women have
to start doubling up.

1140
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:24,544
Oh, that's ridiculous.

1141
00:54:24,554 --> 00:54:25,950
It is girl.

1142
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:29,060
There is no biblical
reference for such nonsense.

1143
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:32,240
You girls can find all the
good black men you need

1144
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:34,840
and you don't gotta
downgrade yourselves, either.

1145
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:36,897
All you gotta do is go to prison.

1146
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:40,200
That's not downgrading yourself?

1147
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:41,440
No, I'm serious.

1148
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:43,400
Prison is the only place where...

1149
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,340
Maxwell, Larry.

1150
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:49,070
It's been a while.

1151
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,380
My stoop isn't used to such a gathering

1152
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:52,900
but find yourselves a seat.

1153
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:58,938
So, Maxwell, what brings you
and your friends up this way?

1154
00:54:58,948 --> 00:54:59,771
One guess.

1155
00:54:59,781 --> 00:55:01,150
Oh come on, now.

1156
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,870
Can't you be civil to your Aunt Flo?

1157
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,030
This is between Jamela
and me, okay, that's it.

1158
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,880
Oh no, oh no, that's not it at all.

1159
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:11,220
Why'd you have to bring your entourage?

1160
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:14,960
No, you've always relied on
Jamela to be your strength.

1161
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:17,520
Well, now you gotta learn by yourself.

1162
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:19,330
Well look, if you could
just keep your dime store

1163
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:20,783
philosophy to yourself, okay?

1164
00:55:20,793 --> 00:55:21,961
Max, respect.

1165
00:55:23,955 --> 00:55:26,980
I'm sorry, I just wish it
wasn't Wednesday, you know?

1166
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:32,080
It's just that in African traditions,

1167
00:55:32,090 --> 00:55:34,639
you know Wednesday's a bad
day to make any decisions.

1168
00:55:34,649 --> 00:55:36,980
Has something to do with the energies

1169
00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:39,680
and the moon and the chakras.

1170
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:44,070
It's just always better to
make a decision on Thursdays.

1171
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:49,280
Max, you know my answer.

1172
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:50,460
I'm your brother.

1173
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:52,260
And I'm your sister.

1174
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:54,780
I don't have time or patience.

1175
00:55:54,790 --> 00:55:57,560
If I get cancer, if it
moves into my cervix,

1176
00:55:57,570 --> 00:55:58,660
it's different for a man.

1177
00:55:58,670 --> 00:56:01,510
It's just that Jamela needs some time

1178
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,840
to be with herself and Zalea.

1179
00:56:03,850 --> 00:56:04,890
You can understand that.

1180
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:05,960
I mean, come on.

1181
00:56:05,970 --> 00:56:07,360
You oughta be able to.

1182
00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:10,250
You're always tripping off
into some fantasy land,

1183
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:12,070
dragging Jamela down with you.

1184
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,620
You probably could use some rest yourself.

1185
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:16,300
Look, look, there is
no time for rest, okay?

1186
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:19,660
You're always finding some cause to fight,

1187
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:22,370
but really the only cause
you're fighting is yourself.

1188
00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:25,260
Max it's time to come home.

1189
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:26,987
It's time for home.

1190
00:56:38,038 --> 00:56:39,038
Yeah, right.

1191
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:46,650
It's been a pleasure to meet you.

1192
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:55,910
You did the right thing, girl.

1193
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,420
How could you let him leave?

1194
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:03,140
How could I let myself stay?

1195
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:20,866
To feel like I feel.

1196
00:57:20,876 --> 00:57:21,699
Nina, Nina, where is she?

1197
00:57:21,709 --> 00:57:22,594
Right or wrong.

1198
00:57:22,604 --> 00:57:23,900
Nina, where is she?

1199
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:24,913
You know I don't have time...

1200
00:57:24,923 --> 00:57:26,944
I just see you.

1201
00:57:26,954 --> 00:57:27,955
Nina.

1202
00:57:27,965 --> 00:57:29,589
'Cause you made me love you.

1203
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,640
Hey, hey, mother fucker.

1204
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:31,998
Get the fuck off.

1205
00:57:32,008 --> 00:57:33,913
Nigger, who the fuck you think you are?

1206
00:57:33,923 --> 00:57:35,113
That's my bitch, nigger.

1207
00:57:35,123 --> 00:57:37,990
That your bitch, that's your bitch, nigger?

1208
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,700
Fuck out of my face mother fucker.

1209
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:42,680
No baby, you gotta pay.

1210
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:46,078
This here's a capitalist society.

1211
00:57:47,355 --> 00:57:48,178
Come on, come on.

1212
00:57:48,188 --> 00:57:49,011
Pull yourself up, come on.

1213
00:57:49,021 --> 00:57:50,410
Ooh, I feel so good.

1214
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:51,935
Ooh, so good.

1215
00:57:51,945 --> 00:57:52,768
Yeah, yeah honey.

1216
00:57:52,778 --> 00:57:53,737
Look, relax yourself.

1217
00:57:53,747 --> 00:57:54,955
Relax?

1218
00:57:54,965 --> 00:57:55,788
Relax yourself.

1219
00:57:55,798 --> 00:57:56,621
Why should I relax?

1220
00:57:56,631 --> 00:57:59,610
You relax, you relax mother fucker.

1221
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:00,960
You relax.

1222
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:02,730
What are we gonna do about her?

1223
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:06,327
Liz, don't worry about it, shit.

1224
00:58:06,337 --> 00:58:08,820
I just want to kill me somebody.

1225
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:09,830
You hear me, girl?

1226
00:58:10,846 --> 00:58:12,479
I just want to kill me somebody.

1227
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:13,433
Tell 'em, girl.

1228
00:58:13,443 --> 00:58:15,640
Shoot, I'm strong.

1229
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:16,473
Tell me who.

1230
00:58:16,483 --> 00:58:17,483
Who?

1231
00:58:20,255 --> 00:58:21,511
Who?

1232
00:58:21,521 --> 00:58:23,854
You, you, you mother fucker.

1233
00:58:25,796 --> 00:58:26,963
You, you, him.

1234
00:58:29,928 --> 00:58:32,595
No, it's not gonna work no more.

1235
00:58:33,818 --> 00:58:35,901
Please, I need some shit.

1236
00:58:36,787 --> 00:58:38,549
You gotta help me out.

1237
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:39,467
Careful Nina.

1238
00:58:39,477 --> 00:58:41,630
Get the fuck off.

1239
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:42,670
Max, wait.

1240
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:46,280
Everything is fucked and me most of all.

1241
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:49,750
God burns in heaven and
the devil freezes in hell

1242
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,230
and what difference does it make, huh?

1243
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,171
You know?

1244
00:58:53,181 --> 00:58:54,629
What difference does it make?

1245
00:58:54,639 --> 00:58:57,380
Maybe after all is said and done,

1246
00:58:57,390 --> 00:58:59,410
maybe when all this shit is over,

1247
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:02,160
there'll be a little
bit of love left for me.

1248
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:04,790
And I will know just what to do with it.

1249
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:08,694
Get out of my way.

1250
00:59:13,810 --> 00:59:15,980
It's day two in the
mysterious disappearance

1251
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:18,130
of Councilman Melvin Freeman.

1252
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:20,360
His secretary reports
Mr. Freeman left work

1253
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:22,190
for a dinner engagement Tuesday night

1254
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,480
and has not been heard from since.

1255
00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:26,350
You'll remember the councilman had recently

1256
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:28,360
been victim of two faggot attacks

1257
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:30,150
by the notorious drag queen gang

1258
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:34,635
that has been rampaging the
city and still remains at large.

1259
01:00:04,039 --> 01:00:04,862
Mel.

1260
01:00:04,872 --> 01:00:05,695
Douglas.

1261
01:00:05,705 --> 01:00:06,528
Thanks for coming.

1262
01:00:06,538 --> 01:00:07,361
I really appreciate it.

1263
01:00:07,371 --> 01:00:09,100
Blink, mother fucker
and you die in the dark.

1264
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:11,540
I heard you got my name on your list.

1265
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:14,050
Well now, I got yours.

1266
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:17,460
Alright, everybody drop your tools.

1267
01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:18,293
Get them hands in the air.

1268
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:19,126
Good work, Al.

1269
01:00:19,136 --> 01:00:19,978
And you trusted him?

1270
01:00:19,988 --> 01:00:21,250
That's enough out of you.

1271
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:22,594
You alright, Councilman?

1272
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,714
Everybody freeze!

1273
01:00:26,724 --> 01:00:27,547
You lyin' son of a...

1274
01:00:27,557 --> 01:00:28,557
Max, no, Max!

1275
01:00:30,081 --> 01:00:31,081
Move.

1276
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:33,962
Move!

1277
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,110
Marmalade.

1278
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:39,010
Hurry.

1279
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:43,720
Let's go, let's go, run!

1280
01:00:44,734 --> 01:00:45,557
Run, hurry!

1281
01:00:45,567 --> 01:00:46,390
Max, come on!

1282
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,812
That's who framed us!

1283
01:00:47,822 --> 01:00:48,822
That one.

1284
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,077
Ma, Ma?

1285
01:00:54,938 --> 01:00:56,638
Where's your mother?

1286
01:01:00,625 --> 01:01:01,529
He's shot.

1287
01:01:01,539 --> 01:01:04,272
Oh my God, Samuel!

1288
01:01:04,282 --> 01:01:05,105
What are you doing to me?

1289
01:01:05,115 --> 01:01:05,938
Gotta help him.

1290
01:01:05,948 --> 01:01:07,385
Are you going to medical school?

1291
01:01:07,395 --> 01:01:08,218
Look at this.

1292
01:01:08,228 --> 01:01:09,564
Oh my God, oh my God.

1293
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:19,500
Alright, alright, dear,
get a bottle of whiskey.

1294
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:21,220
On the table, on the table.

1295
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:22,656
Lay him down gently.

1296
01:01:22,666 --> 01:01:23,711
Gently, gently.

1297
01:01:23,721 --> 01:01:24,721
Oh!

1298
01:01:26,742 --> 01:01:27,730
Give him the whiskey.

1299
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:29,968
Not on the wound, not on the wound.

1300
01:01:29,978 --> 01:01:30,801
Give it to him.

1301
01:01:30,811 --> 01:01:31,752
It's an anesthesia.

1302
01:01:31,762 --> 01:01:32,660
Careful, careful.

1303
01:01:32,670 --> 01:01:33,833
No, don't stir the wound.

1304
01:01:33,843 --> 01:01:35,250
Alright, alright, alright.

1305
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:36,260
Lemme just see.

1306
01:01:41,819 --> 01:01:42,650
Need a band-aid.

1307
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:43,840
Come on Max.

1308
01:01:43,850 --> 01:01:44,673
Pour it in his mouth.

1309
01:01:44,683 --> 01:01:45,660
He's got AIDS?

1310
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:46,493
Alright, alright.

1311
01:01:46,503 --> 01:01:47,543
Let's be careful, alright.

1312
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,010
Put the antiseptic on the gauze.

1313
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:51,137
Larva.

1314
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:54,468
It'll sting, it'll sting.

1315
01:01:54,478 --> 01:01:56,353
It'll sting, it'll sting.

1316
01:01:56,363 --> 01:01:57,186
Don't move.

1317
01:01:57,196 --> 01:01:58,019
Ow!

1318
01:01:58,029 --> 01:01:59,009
Shit.

1319
01:01:59,019 --> 01:01:59,934
Goddammit.

1320
01:01:59,944 --> 01:02:01,768
I'm sorry.

1321
01:02:01,778 --> 01:02:02,601
Hold him down.

1322
01:02:02,611 --> 01:02:03,611
Hold him...

1323
01:02:05,578 --> 01:02:06,415
I don't like that.

1324
01:02:06,425 --> 01:02:08,092
Marmalade, tell 'em.

1325
01:02:09,289 --> 01:02:10,483
You know what a scalpel is?

1326
01:02:10,493 --> 01:02:12,038
Get me the scalpel from in there.

1327
01:02:12,871 --> 01:02:13,772
Yes.

1328
01:02:13,782 --> 01:02:17,420
Ma.

1329
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:20,390
Careful, careful.

1330
01:02:21,393 --> 01:02:22,216
You alright?

1331
01:02:22,226 --> 01:02:23,112
Okay, it's gonna hurt.

1332
01:02:23,122 --> 01:02:24,167
Okay, it's gonna hurt.

1333
01:02:24,177 --> 01:02:25,000
I ain't bitch.

1334
01:02:25,010 --> 01:02:25,833
It's gonna hurt.

1335
01:02:25,843 --> 01:02:26,666
Everybody hold him.

1336
01:02:26,676 --> 01:02:28,775
Everybody hold him.

1337
01:02:28,785 --> 01:02:29,785
Gonna hurt.

1338
01:02:29,795 --> 01:02:30,818
Ouch!

1339
01:02:30,828 --> 01:02:31,651
Alright, alright, alright.

1340
01:02:31,661 --> 01:02:32,670
I see the bullet.

1341
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:35,101
Alright, I see it.

1342
01:02:35,111 --> 01:02:36,983
Calm him down.

1343
01:02:36,993 --> 01:02:37,816
Goddamn, get this bitch off of me!

1344
01:02:37,826 --> 01:02:38,780
Get her off.

1345
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:39,649
It's okay.

1346
01:02:39,659 --> 01:02:40,517
Damn.

1347
01:02:40,527 --> 01:02:44,099
I see it.

1348
01:02:44,109 --> 01:02:45,850
I see it, I see it.

1349
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:46,940
Alright, get me the,

1350
01:02:49,085 --> 01:02:51,202
alright, hold him down, hold him down.

1351
01:02:57,097 --> 01:03:00,808
It's good, he's alive.

1352
01:03:00,818 --> 01:03:04,103
Alright, alright, hold him down.

1353
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:05,196
Ow, ow, ow!

1354
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:06,855
It's alright, it's okay.

1355
01:03:06,865 --> 01:03:07,969
Now come on, you can take it.

1356
01:03:07,979 --> 01:03:09,896
You can take it, bitch.

1357
01:03:21,155 --> 01:03:22,155
Shit!

1358
01:03:45,785 --> 01:03:46,808
Oh, there it is.

1359
01:03:46,818 --> 01:03:47,818
There it is.

1360
01:03:48,809 --> 01:03:49,939
It's out.

1361
01:03:49,949 --> 01:03:51,602
You did very well.

1362
01:03:51,612 --> 01:03:52,862
Oh goddammit.

1363
01:03:56,008 --> 01:03:57,211
Give him some whiskey.

1364
01:03:57,221 --> 01:04:01,272
give up the bottle.

1365
01:04:01,282 --> 01:04:04,362
Okay, you did just fine.

1366
01:04:08,257 --> 01:04:09,424
He'll be fine.

1367
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:12,559
We got the acquisition files.

1368
01:04:12,569 --> 01:04:14,260
He did just fine.

1369
01:04:14,270 --> 01:04:17,530
Get that damn bitch away from me.

1370
01:04:18,422 --> 01:04:19,422
Get away.

1371
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:27,130
Are you...

1372
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,360
HIV positive too?

1373
01:04:32,565 --> 01:04:33,565
No.

1374
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:44,900
Why didn't you tell me all of this before?

1375
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:47,720
You never asked.

1376
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:48,850
I'm asking.

1377
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:54,990
This is Max.

1378
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:58,320
He's my lover.

1379
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:02,220
I'm gay.

1380
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:06,520
We help people.

1381
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:09,800
This is Max?

1382
01:05:09,810 --> 01:05:12,170
This, he's my lover, we're freaks,

1383
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:14,250
you help people and that's it?

1384
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:15,860
What happened to medical school?

1385
01:05:16,945 --> 01:05:17,945
I hated it.

1386
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:20,530
I gave the money to Max.

1387
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:22,180
To him?

1388
01:05:22,190 --> 01:05:25,420
Oh, Sam you, oh Sam.

1389
01:05:25,430 --> 01:05:28,260
I've worked so hard to
send you to medical school.

1390
01:05:28,270 --> 01:05:30,041
Now, what happened?

1391
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:30,874
What happened?

1392
01:05:30,884 --> 01:05:32,350
Sam, you were such a wonderful baby.

1393
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:34,280
Everything you did was wonderful.

1394
01:05:34,290 --> 01:05:36,067
Everything you touched turned to gold...

1395
01:05:36,077 --> 01:05:36,900
I still am, Ma, I still am.

1396
01:05:36,910 --> 01:05:40,250
I know you still are, dear,

1397
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:41,940
and the best thing for you to do

1398
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:44,570
is just to get away from these people

1399
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:46,330
and go back to medical school, alright?

1400
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:47,720
If you don't like the school,

1401
01:05:47,730 --> 01:05:49,350
if you don't like the
school you're going to...

1402
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:50,183
No, Ma, I want...

1403
01:05:50,193 --> 01:05:51,530
You can go to any other school.

1404
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:52,930
You want to go to Europe?

1405
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:55,170
I'll send you to Europe, alright?

1406
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:56,003
Alright?

1407
01:05:56,013 --> 01:05:56,999
Just get away from these people.

1408
01:05:57,009 --> 01:05:57,832
Ma, Ma...

1409
01:05:57,842 --> 01:05:58,740
They're a bad influence on you.

1410
01:05:58,750 --> 01:05:59,868
I want to go to Manila.

1411
01:05:59,878 --> 01:06:00,878
Manila!

1412
01:06:01,892 --> 01:06:03,099
Are you crazy?

1413
01:06:03,109 --> 01:06:03,932
Manil...

1414
01:06:03,942 --> 01:06:04,765
God!

1415
01:06:04,775 --> 01:06:06,270
Sam, I tried to get out
of there and we're here.

1416
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:07,540
We're fine now, alright?

1417
01:06:07,550 --> 01:06:09,090
I don't want you to go to Manila, alright.

1418
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:10,033
Ma!

1419
01:06:10,043 --> 01:06:10,866
No, the thing to do is to get away

1420
01:06:10,876 --> 01:06:12,586
from these people, I want
these people out of here...

1421
01:06:12,596 --> 01:06:13,419
Ma, I love you.

1422
01:06:13,429 --> 01:06:14,252
And you go to school.

1423
01:06:14,262 --> 01:06:15,085
Ma, I love you.

1424
01:06:15,095 --> 01:06:15,950
I love you too, and that's not the point.

1425
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:18,510
Alright, alright all you
people, come back in here.

1426
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:20,320
Pick him up and take him out of here.

1427
01:06:20,330 --> 01:06:22,320
I want you freaks out of here.

1428
01:06:22,330 --> 01:06:24,470
You people turned my son into a faggot!

1429
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,560
He's not a fag!

1430
01:06:25,570 --> 01:06:27,390
Alright, just get out of here!

1431
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,300
I want you out of here right now.

1432
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:30,550
Pick up all your dirty things

1433
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:33,420
and get out of here and don't come back!

1434
01:06:33,430 --> 01:06:35,334
Sam, I don't want you
seeing these people anymore,

1435
01:06:35,344 --> 01:06:36,740
alright, don't you see these people

1436
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:37,820
and don't call him.

1437
01:06:37,830 --> 01:06:38,653
Put your arm around him.

1438
01:06:38,663 --> 01:06:39,977
I guess your date never did show up, huh?

1439
01:06:39,987 --> 01:06:41,931
Get out.

1440
01:06:41,941 --> 01:06:43,548
Get out.

1441
01:06:43,558 --> 01:06:44,381
Come on, Larva.

1442
01:06:44,391 --> 01:06:45,214
Let's just go.

1443
01:06:45,224 --> 01:06:46,047
Get out and don't come back.

1444
01:06:46,057 --> 01:06:46,953
Thank you, Miss Yien.

1445
01:06:46,963 --> 01:06:48,700
We ain't coming back.

1446
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:53,570
I just forgot something for a minute.

1447
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:55,140
I'll see you later Sam, okay?

1448
01:06:55,150 --> 01:06:57,160
You have a lovely home.

1449
01:06:57,170 --> 01:07:01,030

01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:17,240
I love them hot toy.

1464
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:18,680
That hot toy.

1465
01:08:18,690 --> 01:08:20,170
Well, that's a different kind baby.

1466
01:08:20,844 --> 01:08:22,408
Give me some orgies.

1467
01:08:22,418 --> 01:08:23,955
Wait, lookie, look!

1468
01:08:23,965 --> 01:08:25,640
Larry, Larry.

1469
01:08:25,650 --> 01:08:26,650
Ah!

1470
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,624
Oh God, Sammy.

1471
01:08:29,634 --> 01:08:30,457
I missed you.

1472
01:08:30,467 --> 01:08:31,383
Oh, precious, I missed you too.

1473
01:08:31,393 --> 01:08:32,216
How've you been?

1474
01:08:32,226 --> 01:08:33,049
I been fine.

1475
01:08:33,059 --> 01:08:35,570
Ooh, you look bigger, yes you do.

1476
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:36,403
It's the shirt.

1477
01:08:36,413 --> 01:08:37,236
Oh, it ain't no shirt.

1478
01:08:37,246 --> 01:08:38,162
Cute!

1479
01:08:38,172 --> 01:08:39,750
Isn't he great?

1480
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,636
Ooh, Sam.

1481
01:08:41,646 --> 01:08:43,500
This is Claude.

1482
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:45,177
Claude's my husband.

1483
01:08:46,278 --> 01:08:48,232
We got married.

1484
01:08:51,090 --> 01:08:53,640
Oh, it's been a long time.

1485
01:08:53,650 --> 01:08:54,473
So, how've you been?

1486
01:08:54,483 --> 01:08:55,306
Good.

1487
01:08:55,316 --> 01:08:56,630
Well, you know what I want you to do?

1488
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:57,880
I want you to stay for
dinner, 'cause we have

1489
01:08:57,890 --> 01:09:00,110
some hot dogs, some macaroni and cheese,

1490
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:01,910
some pinto beans, some lima beans,

1491
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,717
some kidney beans, some green beans.

1492
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:05,925
And don't forget...

1493
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:12,410
He cooks, cleans, is artistic and fucks

1494
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:14,430
me like a horse in heat.

1495
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:16,790
And he's so dark skinned.

1496
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:18,517
I know.

1497
01:09:18,527 --> 01:09:19,350
Ooh.

1498
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:20,360
Ooh I know.

1499
01:09:21,542 --> 01:09:22,840
I know.

1500
01:09:22,850 --> 01:09:24,200
How many times you gonna know?

1501
01:09:24,210 --> 01:09:25,210
Oh shut up.

1502
01:09:25,930 --> 01:09:26,990
Old fool.

1503
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:34,850
Sammy is smoking.

1504
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:36,860
You better go ahead.

1505
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:38,543
Trying to quit, actually.

1506
01:09:38,553 --> 01:09:39,925
Oh, oh really?

1507
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:44,940
So.

1508
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
You stopped writing.

1509
01:09:49,050 --> 01:09:51,390
So you don't know what's happened.

1510
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:52,400
You don't know.

1511
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:54,320
What's happened?

1512
01:09:54,330 --> 01:09:56,000
You should have written.

1513
01:09:56,010 --> 01:09:57,600
I wrote.

1514
01:09:57,610 --> 01:10:00,510
Unknown address or return
to sender but still I wrote.

1515
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:01,343
Dammit, Larry.

1516
01:10:01,353 --> 01:10:02,470
I don't need this.

1517
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:05,040
You know why I went away.

1518
01:10:05,970 --> 01:10:08,600
I'm not gonna apologize, I'm not.

1519
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:11,410
Just tell me what you have to.

1520
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:12,420
Jamela's dead.

1521
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:18,850
February 21st.

1522
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:22,110
Nina Simone's birthday.

1523
01:10:23,496 --> 01:10:26,920
Oh, a cunt to the end.

1524
01:10:26,930 --> 01:10:29,950
She kept lecturing me on and on and on

1525
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:33,240
and sending me to the store for candy.

1526
01:10:33,250 --> 01:10:34,620
Can you image the vicomtess

1527
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:36,441
going to the store for candy?

1528
01:10:38,170 --> 01:10:39,860
Oh, but she was okay.

1529
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:44,190
She had her family around to see her off,

1530
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:45,590
and Flo's got her baby.

1531
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:47,980
Did she get my letter?

1532
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:50,980
I don't know.

1533
01:10:53,390 --> 01:10:54,780
But she wished you well.

1534
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:56,760
She did.

1535
01:11:03,010 --> 01:11:04,870
Lady Marmalade was killed, too.

1536
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:08,500
When they found her in the hotel room,

1537
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:11,900
strangled under the bed, the only thing

1538
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:15,600
holding her head to her shoulders was skin.

1539
01:11:20,370 --> 01:11:21,620
Creole Lady Marmalade.

1540
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:24,640
Dear God.

1541
01:11:28,730 --> 01:11:31,920
And your boyfriend is now Congressman.

1542
01:11:31,930 --> 01:11:33,140
But you outed him.

1543
01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:33,973
Ha!

1544
01:11:33,983 --> 01:11:36,150
That was a happy day for her.

1545
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:39,380
Oh, sister denied nothing and lept all over

1546
01:11:39,390 --> 01:11:41,280
the liberal middle road gate ticket

1547
01:11:41,290 --> 01:11:43,380
and really tear the roof off a sucker.

1548
01:11:45,030 --> 01:11:47,250
Mmm, we never got fingered
for the crimes, though.

1549
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:49,019
I give her that.

1550
01:11:49,029 --> 01:11:51,510
So you're telling me
Melvin Freeman's a gay hero?

1551
01:11:52,670 --> 01:11:55,180
Heroine, darling, heroine.

1552
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:57,420
Oh, please.

1553
01:11:57,430 --> 01:11:59,320
She still votes fascist.

1554
01:11:59,330 --> 01:12:01,756
But nationally renowned now as

1555
01:12:01,766 --> 01:12:04,280
the first gay congressman of color.

1556
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:06,930
I'll give her that.

1557
01:12:08,810 --> 01:12:10,241
And there you go.

1558
01:12:10,251 --> 01:12:11,178
There you go.

1559
01:12:11,188 --> 01:12:12,188
Mmm.

1560
01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:15,890
Larry?

1561
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:16,900
Yeah, sweetie.

1562
01:12:23,830 --> 01:12:24,830
Sammy.

1563
01:12:27,825 --> 01:12:28,648
It's not good.

1564
01:12:28,658 --> 01:12:29,510
What do you expect?

1565
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:30,610
He got shot.

1566
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:33,230
He's got pneumonia.

1567
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:34,460
He's got night sweats.

1568
01:12:34,470 --> 01:12:35,350
He's got shingles.

1569
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:36,620
He's coughing up blood.

1570
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:37,630
Does he hate me?

1571
01:12:42,370 --> 01:12:43,840
