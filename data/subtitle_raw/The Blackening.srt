00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,413
Nobody should judge anybody
in here, bruh.

1009
00:47:26,496 --> 00:47:27,914
I know you ain't
trying to argue about

1010
00:47:27,997 --> 00:47:29,833
who should be
the Blackest here, Nnamdi.

1011
00:47:29,916 --> 00:47:33,545
-What? Why?
-Because you are a literal African, Nnamdi.

1012
00:47:33,628 --> 00:47:35,755
You are, like, still
in its original packaging Black.

1013
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:38,675
I'm sorry, boo, but on paper,
you the Blackest.

1014
00:47:38,758 --> 00:47:40,093
First of all,
I'm from Oakland, all right,

1015
00:47:40,176 --> 00:47:41,469
and my daddy is
from South Africa.

1016
00:47:41,553 --> 00:47:43,763
So, Townbiz,
Raider Nation, Go A's,

1017
00:47:43,847 --> 00:47:45,849
Michael B. Jordan, Fruitvale
Station off top, bruh.

1018
00:47:45,932 --> 00:47:46,975
Mmm. That just
makes you Blacker.

1019
00:47:47,058 --> 00:47:48,601
ALLISON: Mmm-hmm.

1020
00:47:48,685 --> 00:47:50,270
But if anybody
is the Blackest here,

1021
00:47:50,353 --> 00:47:52,564
it's African diaspora,
Angela Rye head ass over here.

1022
00:47:52,647 --> 00:47:55,025
-Wow, Nnamdi, really?
-Yeah!

1023
00:47:55,108 --> 00:47:56,901
Okay. So, that's what we doing?

1024
00:47:56,985 --> 00:47:59,070
Because every single time
one of y'all make a joke,

1025
00:47:59,154 --> 00:48:01,990
it's always, "Oh, Allison, you white this.
Allison, you white that."

1026
00:48:02,073 --> 00:48:04,868
But now, when it is
the most convenient for you,

1027
00:48:04,951 --> 00:48:06,161
you wanna use my Blackness?

1028
00:48:06,244 --> 00:48:08,329
-Absolutely.
-Absolutely not, nigga.

1029
00:48:08,413 --> 00:48:10,832
Because guess what?
If we playing this game,

1030
00:48:10,915 --> 00:48:14,669
my daddy is white with "wha",
so it's surely not me.

1031
00:48:14,753 --> 00:48:16,629
-King?
-King?

1032
00:48:16,713 --> 00:48:18,882
-Yeah, King. -'Cause you the
one with the gun and you gangsta.

1033
00:48:18,965 --> 00:48:20,925
I'm a ex-gangsta, all right?
I changed my life.

1034
00:48:21,009 --> 00:48:22,635
And I'm married
to a white woman, so...

1035
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:24,888
-That does not help.
-You right. I'mma shut up.

1036
00:48:24,971 --> 00:48:27,766
-Ninety seconds.
-Oh, my God, this is not working.

1037
00:48:27,849 --> 00:48:29,476
I'mma need so much therapy
if we get through this.

1038
00:48:29,559 --> 00:48:31,936
-What about Dewayne?
-Girl, shut your ass up.

1039
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:33,396
Did you not hear what I said?

1040
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,231
Therapy. Black people
don't do therapy.

1041
00:48:35,315 --> 00:48:37,108
Well, actually, Black people
are slowly but surely

1042
00:48:37,192 --> 00:48:39,027
adopting healthier
mental health lifestyles.

1043
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:40,487
Hey, big fucking deal.

1044
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:41,946
No, deadass, big fucking deal.

1045
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:43,365

It's a beautiful thing.

-Yeah.
-We have.

But that's not the point.

1048
00:48:46,034 --> 00:48:47,827

y'all can't pick me. I'm gay.

homophobic family member says,

1051
00:48:52,207 --> 00:48:55,418
"Gayness is just whiteness wrapped up
in a bunch of dicks," and today, I agree.

-Seventy seconds left.

-We can't.

What about Clifton?

pick his little weak-ass?

quiet in the corner,

1057
00:49:04,678 --> 00:49:06,262
but you did not get invited
to this event,

1058
00:49:06,346 --> 00:49:07,555
but yet you showed up.

1059
00:49:07,639 --> 00:49:08,765
That is some Black shit, nigga.

1060

00:49:10,266 --> 00:49:13,395

by Morgan.

-How?
-Sixty seconds.

1063
00:49:15,605 --> 00:49:17,148

1064
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:20,944
Guys, I can prove
I'm not the Blackest.

-Prove it.

-I've never seen Friday.
-What the fuck?

was a type of seasoning.

without The Roots.

-Um...

in the face of adversity.

go into some complete dramatic-ass monologue

need to pick somebody, all right, and...

you'd know that this is what
the game wanted us to do.

1103

To turn on each other.
To act like animals.

fuck somebody up with this.

some of them painkillers.

-Yes.

Here, you can take this.
Vicodin.

No, you supposed to be dead, bruh.

but I can run. My legs work.

start lagging, we ain't carrying your ass.

you was gonna say that shit,

but I figured that was just
your white side talking.

1212

This is not my white half
talking, Nnamdi.

1213

This is me talking
as a whole-ass Black person

who just so happens
to be biracial.

1215
00:56:48,850 --> 00:56:50,518
My "Blackness"
should not be in question

1216
00:56:50,602 --> 00:56:53,104
just because
I am simply suggesting

1217
00:56:53,188 --> 00:56:55,607
that separating might
actually help us stay alive.

1218
00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:57,400
Allison, yes,
you do have a point.

1219
00:56:57,484 --> 00:56:59,319
But do you really think your
Black side did them air quotes?

1220
00:56:59,402 --> 00:57:00,820

exclusively Caucasian.

it. No time like the present.

01:22:04,908 --> 01:22:06,284
Question one.

1664
01:22:07,619 --> 01:22:09,120
Why am I doing this?

1665
01:22:12,624 --> 01:22:15,752
Now, listen, you should be
familiar with the rules by now.

1666
01:22:15,835 --> 01:22:19,047
It's been a long night.
Right answers only.

1667
01:22:19,130 --> 01:22:21,091
-But we don't know.
-(IMITATES BUZZER)

1668
01:22:21,174 --> 01:22:23,677
-Wrong answer.
-Shit!

1669
01:22:26,388 --> 01:22:29,766
So, hey, Dewayne,
the next one won't miss.

1670
01:22:29,849 --> 01:22:31,976
Gonna ask you
just one more time.

1671
01:22:32,060 --> 01:22:37,148
Question one!
Why am I doing this?

1672
01:22:37,232 --> 01:22:40,110
The article
about the girl you killed?

1673
01:22:40,193 --> 01:22:43,029
Ding, ding, ding, ding.
Good job, Lis.

1674
01:22:43,113 --> 01:22:45,615
Good job. Right.

1675
01:22:45,699 --> 01:22:49,160
Per the article, that happened
ten years ago tonight.

1676
01:22:49,244 --> 01:22:55,041
Question two, what else happened
ten years ago tonight?

1677
01:22:55,125 --> 01:22:58,336
It was... It was, uh...
It was...

1678
01:22:58,420 --> 01:23:00,130
The what? The what? Come on.

1679
01:23:00,213 --> 01:23:03,216
The party. It was the party.
It was the Juneteenth party.

1680
01:23:03,299 --> 01:23:05,010
Ding fucking ding.

1681
01:23:05,093 --> 01:23:07,595
-I remember you got really drunk.
-Okay.

1682
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:09,139
Lisa and I kept trying
to give your ass shots,

1683
01:23:09,222 --> 01:23:10,765
but all you wanted to do
was fucking play Spades.

1684
01:23:10,849 --> 01:23:12,308
The pot was up to $1,000
that night

1685
01:23:12,392 --> 01:23:14,269
and everybody
was acting fucking crazy.

1686
01:23:14,352 --> 01:23:16,813
Yeah, motherfuckers
were fucking tripping.

1687
01:23:16,896 --> 01:23:19,858
You know,
I was just so excited

1688
01:23:19,941 --> 01:23:22,569
to be around people
that looked like me.

1689
01:23:22,652 --> 01:23:24,154
And I'll be the first to admit,

1690
01:23:24,237 --> 01:23:27,907
I was never
the best dancer, Dewayne,

1691
01:23:27,991 --> 01:23:29,826
or the funniest, Shanika,

1692
01:23:29,909 --> 01:23:31,870
or the best cheater, Nnamdi.

1693
01:23:31,953 --> 01:23:34,789
Relax. Or whatever you do, Lisa.

1694
01:23:34,873 --> 01:23:37,292
-I'm an attorney.
-Congrats.

1695
01:23:37,375 --> 01:23:42,213
But you know, one thing I love
more than all that is games.

1696
01:23:42,297 --> 01:23:44,674
Monopoly, chess,
checkers, Connect Four,

1697
01:23:44,758 --> 01:23:47,844
whatever you wanna play me in,
I'm a monster at, you know.

1698
01:23:47,927 --> 01:23:52,640
But the one game I could never,
ever really get a handle on

1699
01:23:52,724 --> 01:23:53,683
was Spades.

1700
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:58,897
Because nobody
plays Spades in Vermont!

1701
01:24:00,690 --> 01:24:03,943
So, that night
I made one honest mistake.

1702
01:24:06,237 --> 01:24:08,656
I thought I was out of clubs.

1703
01:24:08,740 --> 01:24:12,202
Oh, shit, shit. I remember that.
You fucked around and you reneged.

1704
01:24:12,285 --> 01:24:13,578
And it could have happened
to anybody.

1705
01:24:13,661 --> 01:24:15,205
Not to niggas
who know how to play.

1706
01:24:15,288 --> 01:24:17,290
-It was an honest mistake!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1707
01:24:21,252 --> 01:24:22,629
-What you doing?
-Yes!

1708
01:24:26,925 --> 01:24:30,345
-Motherfucker.
-Clifton? I thought he was dead.

1709
01:24:30,428 --> 01:24:32,013
I guess he's better at games
than we thought.

1710
01:24:32,097 --> 01:24:34,391
It was a simple mistake.

1711
01:24:34,474 --> 01:24:37,811
A mistake that
you all couldn't let go.

1712
01:24:37,894 --> 01:24:43,149
You turned it into some
ultimatum about how Black I was.

1713
01:24:43,233 --> 01:24:47,779
And you laughed at me, and you
attacked me about my Blackness.

1714
01:24:49,781 --> 01:24:51,241
And then you ruined my life.

1715
01:24:51,324 --> 01:24:53,618
Everyone gets shit over Spades.

1716
01:24:53,702 --> 01:24:55,662
It's not like someone revoked
your Black card.

1717
01:24:55,745 --> 01:24:58,790
No, Lisa, you're incorrect.
That's exactly what you said.

1718
01:24:58,873 --> 01:25:00,750
Your exact words. I remember.

1719
01:25:00,834 --> 01:25:03,044
You said, "Yeah, nigga,
your Black card's revoked."

1720
01:25:03,128 --> 01:25:04,254
That's what you said.

1721
01:25:04,337 --> 01:25:06,423
You know, that... that tracks.

1722
01:25:06,506 --> 01:25:10,385
You know, I was really honored
to be your friend, you know.

1723
01:25:11,469 --> 01:25:13,888
Until you said what you said.

1724
01:25:13,972 --> 01:25:17,559
And then I became
embarrassed, rejected.

1725
01:25:17,642 --> 01:25:18,685
And you know what I did?

1726
01:25:20,437 --> 01:25:23,773
I drank for the first time ever
that night,

1727
01:25:23,857 --> 01:25:27,318
and I drove away
to escape the ridicule.

1728
01:25:27,402 --> 01:25:31,197
And I didn't see this woman
in front of me

1729
01:25:32,323 --> 01:25:35,952
until her body hit my car.

1730
01:25:37,162 --> 01:25:38,580
If he controlling the locks,

1731
01:25:38,663 --> 01:25:40,331
who was controlling them
when he was with us?

1732
01:25:44,502 --> 01:25:47,047
I served four years in jail.

1733
01:25:47,130 --> 01:25:48,590
Four years for manslaughter?

1734
01:25:48,673 --> 01:25:51,092
That's like grad school, man.

1735
01:25:51,176 --> 01:25:55,180
You know,
I got a little jealous

1736
01:25:56,723 --> 01:25:58,183
of seeing
the lives you were living,

1737
01:25:58,266 --> 01:25:59,684
the amazing lives
you were living,

1738
01:25:59,768 --> 01:26:01,936
because my life got taken away.

1739
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:05,023
Because I wasn't
Black enough for you.

1740
01:26:05,106 --> 01:26:08,902
I honestly thought
that those redneck twins

1741
01:26:08,985 --> 01:26:13,365
would have gotten the job done,
but they didn't.

1742
01:26:13,448 --> 01:26:16,201
I guess cheap labor
is cheap for a reason.

1743
01:26:16,284 --> 01:26:18,244
Anyway, I'm gonna
kill you guys now,

1744
01:26:18,328 --> 01:26:21,289
and I'm gonna dispose of
your bodies the same way I did

1745
01:26:21,373 --> 01:26:23,833
Morgan and Shawn's, in the well.

1746
01:26:25,627 --> 01:26:27,003
ALL: Nigga!

1747
01:26:27,087 --> 01:26:28,254
Nigga indeed.

1748
01:26:33,009 --> 01:26:34,678
-Got it.
-Yeah.

1749
01:26:34,761 --> 01:26:36,096
Oh, fuck.

1750
01:26:36,888 --> 01:26:38,056
Okay.

1751
01:26:40,016 --> 01:26:41,685
I don't know which one...

1752
01:26:41,768 --> 01:26:43,728
-I don't know which one.
-Try that one.

1753
01:26:43,812 --> 01:26:45,355
How about once and for all

1754
01:26:45,438 --> 01:26:49,567
we find out which one of you
is the Blackest?

1755
01:26:49,651 --> 01:26:53,780
I'm gonna call this round
Black Sophie's Choice.

1756
01:26:53,863 --> 01:26:56,783
And remember, you brought this
on yourselves.

1757
01:26:56,866 --> 01:26:58,868
You know, for a moment,

1758
01:26:58,952 --> 01:27:05,542
I actually thought
maybe you changed, maybe,

1759
01:27:05,625 --> 01:27:08,920
until you sent me out to die.

1760
01:27:11,089 --> 01:27:13,925
And why?
Because I wasn't Black enough?

1761
01:27:14,009 --> 01:27:15,510
It was mainly
just the Trump thing.

1762
01:27:15,593 --> 01:27:21,182
Shut up! Lisa, pick!
Who is the Blackest?

1763
01:27:21,266 --> 01:27:24,686
And remember, the one you choose
is gonna die.

1764
01:27:24,769 --> 01:27:26,521
We're not playing your game.
You just gonna kill us anyway.

1765
01:27:26,604 --> 01:27:28,523
-So just do it.
-NNAMDI: Fuck your game, bruh.

1766
01:27:28,606 --> 01:27:31,443
-I think we should keep playing.
-I'm with Shanika and Nnamdi.

1767
01:27:31,526 --> 01:27:33,403
You've been fucking with us
this entire night.

1768
01:27:33,486 --> 01:27:36,698
That's right, so your non-Black,
coon, MAGA ass

1769
01:27:36,781 --> 01:27:39,534
can kiss my Black ass.
Matter of fact...

1770
01:27:39,617 --> 01:27:41,870
-DEWAYNE: Do you trust me?
-LISA: With my life.

1771
01:27:41,953 --> 01:27:44,706
-DEWAYNE: Then play the game.
-SHANIKA: ...your little ass crossbow.

1772
01:27:44,789 --> 01:27:47,167
I should flick your little ass
across this goddamn basement.

1773
01:27:47,250 --> 01:27:49,961
-Okay, I'll play your game.
-Wait, what? Baby, what?

1774
01:27:50,045 --> 01:27:51,713
How the fuck you just gon'
change your mind like that?

1775
01:27:51,796 --> 01:27:54,424
-I'll play your game.
-Yes!

1776
01:27:54,507 --> 01:27:57,594
Finally, we have a competitor.

1777
01:27:57,677 --> 01:27:59,679
Now, go ahead, choose.

1778
01:27:59,763 --> 01:28:01,431
Which one's the Blackest?

1779
01:28:01,514 --> 01:28:03,850
-I choose myself.
-Wait, baby, what?

1780
01:28:03,933 --> 01:28:06,686
What? No, no, that's not
what I... what I said.

1781
01:28:06,770 --> 01:28:08,772
I said choose one of them,
one of them.

1782
01:28:08,855 --> 01:28:11,649
Choose one of them! Go! Now!

1783
01:28:11,733 --> 01:28:13,943
Those are the fucking rules,
Lisa! Pick!

1784
01:28:14,027 --> 01:28:17,197
-DWAYNE: Psst. Nnamdi.
-NNAMDI: You talking to me?

1785
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:19,157
-DEWAYNE: Yes.
-NNAMDI: Yo, this is trippy.

1786
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:20,909
I didn't think this mind
talking worked for the guys.

1787
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:23,370
-But go ahead.
-I need you to hit him low.

1788
01:28:23,453 --> 01:28:25,330
NNAMDI: Wait a minute. What?

1789
01:28:25,413 --> 01:28:28,458
DEWAYNE: I said hit him low
and I'm gonna hit him high.

1790
01:28:28,541 --> 01:28:30,960
Choose one of them!
Choose one of 'em!

1791
01:28:31,044 --> 01:28:32,379
Choose one of 'em, Lisa!

1792
01:28:32,462 --> 01:28:34,047
NNAMDI: He's crazy.
Are you sure?

1793
01:28:34,130 --> 01:28:35,465
DEWAYNE: Yes, nigga. I'm sure.

1794
01:28:35,548 --> 01:28:37,133
LISA: You heard me,
I choose myself.

1795
01:28:37,217 --> 01:28:38,718
-NNAMDI: Okay.
-I refuse to play your game.

1796
01:28:42,389 --> 01:28:44,516
DEWAYNE: Wait,
did you hear all of that?

1797
01:28:44,599 --> 01:28:46,226
CLIFTON:
Yes, motherfucker, I did.

1798
01:28:46,309 --> 01:28:47,602
DEWAYNE: Oh...

1799
01:28:47,686 --> 01:28:49,396
CLIFTON: You done fucked up now!

1800
01:28:50,146 --> 01:28:51,189
(NNAMDI GULPS)

1801
01:28:52,190 --> 01:28:54,234
You guys just gave away

1802
01:28:54,317 --> 01:28:57,153
the only thing
you had going for you.

1803
01:28:58,905 --> 01:29:00,490
And that was
the element of surprise.

1804
01:29:01,741 --> 01:29:04,285
It's fine, Dewayne. It's okay.

1805
01:29:04,369 --> 01:29:08,623
Because luckily...
I still have mine.

1806
01:29:11,001 --> 01:29:12,585
No, no, no!

1807
01:29:12,669 --> 01:29:14,337
-Shit!
-Oh, my God!

1808
01:29:14,421 --> 01:29:17,173
No, no, let him bleed.
Let him go!

1809
01:29:17,257 --> 01:29:20,218
Let him go! Let him bleed.

1810
01:29:20,301 --> 01:29:22,012
-Fuck you.
-Okay?

1811
01:29:22,095 --> 01:29:25,140
Lisa, I don't think
you've fully grasped

1812
01:29:25,223 --> 01:29:27,767
the gravity of this situation.

1813
01:29:27,851 --> 01:29:31,938
So I'm going to repeat myself
one last time!

1814
01:29:33,690 --> 01:29:36,151
Which one of your friends
is the Blackest?

1815
01:29:40,113 --> 01:29:42,490
I... I... I...

1816
01:29:42,574 --> 01:29:44,409
-Um, shit.
-Shall we try two at a time?

1817
01:29:46,244 --> 01:29:50,165
What was that? Hey. Stay
right there. Stay right there!

1818
01:29:50,248 --> 01:29:53,668
Oh! No! Oh, my...

1819
01:29:53,752 --> 01:29:56,004
Okay. Time out, time out.

1820
01:29:56,087 --> 01:29:59,382
-What the fuck?
-Oh, my ear! Let go!

1821
01:29:59,466 --> 01:30:01,217
Shoot him!

1822
01:30:01,301 --> 01:30:02,677
-Shoot who?
-Him!

1823
01:30:02,761 --> 01:30:04,596
-Shoot him!
-Who's him?

1824
01:30:04,679 --> 01:30:06,389
-Shoot him, Shanika!
-Nigga, it's dark!

1825
01:30:06,473 --> 01:30:08,058
-The one on the left.
-The one on the right!

1826
01:30:08,141 --> 01:30:09,351
Who's on the right?
Who's on the left?

1827

1829
01:30:12,562 --> 01:30:14,189
Dewayne, I don't wanna
shoot you. Say something gay.

1830
01:30:14,272 --> 01:30:16,274
Bitch, that is offensive.
How fucking dare you?

1831
01:30:16,358 --> 01:30:17,359
Got it!

1832
01:30:19,361 --> 01:30:20,862
You're gay?

1833
01:30:20,945 --> 01:30:22,447
-Wait, wait, wait.

(DISTANT SPLASH)

1843
01:31:01,569 --> 01:31:04,489
Ain't that some
poetic fucking justice.

1844
01:31:04,572 --> 01:31:07,117
I guess he's not
doing too well.

1845
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:08,660
-Dewayne.
-You see what I did there?

1846
01:31:08,743 --> 01:31:09,994
Somebody's dead, nigga.

-That's a good kick, bruh.
-Thanks.

1848
01:31:12,914 --> 01:31:13,957
Told you we'd handle it.

1849
01:31:15,583 --> 01:31:17,961
-There is an arrow. It's okay.
-I'm sorry.

(CLIFTON LAUGHING MANIACALLY)

1851
01:31:36,771 --> 01:31:39,357
We did it. We survived.

1852
01:31:39,441 --> 01:31:42,444
-So, what do we do now?
-Call the cops?

1853

I don't know no better
I'm on this every day

You cannot run with me, boy
I'm a heavyweight...

1858
01:32:12,432 --> 01:32:14,642
We can always call

-Mmm.
-(GIGGLING)

1860
01:32:16,686 --> 01:32:18,688
When they get here expecting
Hannah, Kailey and Kimberley

1861
01:32:18,772 --> 01:32:21,858
and see our Black asses
and it's bang, bang, then what?

1862
01:32:21,941 --> 01:32:23,318
You right.

1863
01:32:23,401 --> 01:32:26,112
Any other ideas
on how to get help

1864
01:32:26,196 --> 01:32:27,655
without getting shot
in the process?

1865

So, why did we decide
to do this?

1869
01:32:44,631 --> 01:32:47,759
Oh, because firemen
won't shoot you. You see?

1870
01:32:47,842 --> 01:32:49,302
It's called beating the system.

1871
01:32:49,386 --> 01:32:51,179
I know I'm high as fuck,
but, nigga,

1872
01:32:51,262 --> 01:32:52,514

1873
01:32:52,597 --> 01:32:54,015
Yes, I did! The news might come.

1874
01:32:54,099 --> 01:32:56,226
