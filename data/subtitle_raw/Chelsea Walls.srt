1
00:00:27,507 --> 00:00:31,500
(door creaks open)

2
00:00:40,554 --> 00:00:42,989
I've got to go home.

3
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:46,460
Man: No, you don't.

4
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,496
Yes, I do.
I'm going.

5
00:00:49,496 --> 00:00:52,733
Man: Why?

6
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:56,136
'Cause I don't want
to be here right now.

7
00:00:56,136 --> 00:00:57,671
Man: Why not?

8
00:00:57,671 --> 00:01:00,707
I love this place.

9
00:01:00,707 --> 00:01:02,376
Come here.

10
00:01:02,376 --> 00:01:03,977
No.

11
00:01:03,977 --> 00:01:07,970
I'm going home.
I want to wake up in my own bed.

12
00:01:08,548 --> 00:01:10,650
Come here for a second.

13
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,643
No.

14
00:01:28,935 --> 00:01:32,928
I'm going home,
really, I am.

15
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,843
Take this off.

16
00:01:36,843 --> 00:01:40,836
- No.
- Yes.

17
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:53,783
You're stronger than me.
Let me go.

18
00:01:57,731 --> 00:02:00,667
I'm going home.

19
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:02,669
Suit yourself.

20
00:02:02,669 --> 00:02:05,038
What?

21
00:02:05,038 --> 00:02:06,773
You're not here with me.

22
00:02:06,773 --> 00:02:10,766
You're thinking
about something.

23
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,083
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:21,076
Don't be sorry.

25
00:02:21,154 --> 00:02:25,147
Okay.

26
00:02:26,193 --> 00:02:30,186
It's all right.

27
00:02:55,255 --> 00:02:57,991
- Man: Why do you hold me so tight?
- (woman laughs)

28
00:02:57,991 --> 00:03:01,984
- I'm sorry.
- Stop saying that.

29
00:03:03,196 --> 00:03:07,189
So I can stop saying,
"Don't be sorry."

30
00:03:13,106 --> 00:03:15,108
What time is it?

31
00:03:15,108 --> 00:03:18,245
It's late.

32
00:03:18,245 --> 00:03:21,281
Come here.

33
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:24,851
Do you ever think about me?

34
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:28,788
Never.

35
00:03:28,788 --> 00:03:31,191
Good.

36
00:03:31,191 --> 00:03:33,793
Poet:
To begin at the beginning.

37
00:03:33,793 --> 00:03:36,630
Hush.

38
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,933
The babies are sleeping.

39
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:42,068
The farmers, the fishers,

40
00:03:42,068 --> 00:03:44,137
the tradesmen, and pensioners...

41
00:03:44,137 --> 00:03:46,206
...the undertaker,
and the fancy woman,

42
00:03:46,206 --> 00:03:48,909
drunkard, dressmaker,
preacher, policeman,

43
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:52,279
the web-foot cockle women
and their tidy wives.

44
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:55,215
Young girls lie bedded soft,

45
00:03:55,215 --> 00:03:58,518
but glide in their dreams,

46
00:03:58,518 --> 00:04:00,921
with rings and trousseau,

47
00:04:00,921 --> 00:04:03,123
bridesmaided by glow-worms

48
00:04:03,123 --> 00:04:05,959
down the aisles
of the organ-playing wood.

49
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:09,763
The boys are dreaming wicked...

50
00:04:09,763 --> 00:04:12,098
and the cats nap
in the slant corners

51
00:04:12,098 --> 00:04:16,036
or lope sly,
streaking and needling,

52
00:04:16,036 --> 00:04:18,939
on the one cloud of the roofs.

53
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:20,941
You can hear the dew falling,

54
00:04:20,941 --> 00:04:22,976
and a hushed town, breathing.

55
00:04:22,976 --> 00:04:26,969
Only your eyes are unclosed.

56
00:04:27,981 --> 00:04:31,885
And you alone can hear
the invisible starfall.

57
00:04:31,885 --> 00:04:33,887
The darkest-before-dawn

58
00:04:33,887 --> 00:04:36,256
minutely dewgrazed stir

59
00:04:36,256 --> 00:04:39,292
of the black, dab-filled sea.

60
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:42,762
...the Arethusa, the Curlew,
and the Skylark,

61
00:04:42,762 --> 00:04:46,132
Zanzibar, Rhiannon,
the Rover, the Cormorant,

62
00:04:46,132 --> 00:04:50,036
the Star of Wales...
tilt and ride.

63
00:04:50,036 --> 00:04:54,029
Listen...

64
00:04:54,307 --> 00:04:57,911
...the dew falling,
...starfall... sleep of birds,

65
00:04:57,911 --> 00:05:01,904
...milk wood.

66
00:05:02,749 --> 00:05:05,085
This hallway's closed
for the next half hour.

67
00:05:05,085 --> 00:05:06,753
- What happened?
- Nothing.

68
00:05:06,753 --> 00:05:08,655
We'll be out of here
in a half hour.

69
00:05:08,655 --> 00:05:11,057
But I need to get to my apartment
and it's down there.

70
00:05:11,057 --> 00:05:12,325
- Right.
- Hey.

71
00:05:12,325 --> 00:05:13,893
I need to use
that bathroom.

72
00:05:13,893 --> 00:05:15,595
Use the third floor, please.

73
00:05:15,595 --> 00:05:17,263
The bathroom's right there.

74
00:05:17,263 --> 00:05:18,798
And I paid for that.

75
00:05:18,798 --> 00:05:22,135
And I'm telling you
to use the third floor.

76
00:05:22,135 --> 00:05:24,004
Okay.

77
00:05:24,004 --> 00:05:27,641
Don't make
a federal case about it.

78
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:29,909
Poet: Listen. Look...

79
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:31,745
dumbly, royally

80
00:05:31,745 --> 00:05:35,248
winding through the
Coronation of cherry trees;

81
00:05:35,248 --> 00:05:37,884
going through
the graveyard of Bethesda

82
00:05:37,884 --> 00:05:41,154
with winds gloved and folded,

83
00:05:41,154 --> 00:05:42,188
and dew doffed;

84
00:05:42,188 --> 00:05:46,181
tumbling by the Sailors Arms.

85
00:05:46,393 --> 00:05:49,329
New York,
New York, New York!!

86
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:51,097
Neeeew Yoork!

87
00:05:51,097 --> 00:05:53,933
Fucking city! Yes!

88
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:54,968
Whoa!

89
00:05:54,968 --> 00:05:56,636
(laughing)

90
00:05:56,636 --> 00:05:58,171
How long have we been up?

91
00:05:58,171 --> 00:06:01,074
Uhh... oh Christ,

92
00:06:01,074 --> 00:06:04,411
You gotta figure
we've been on the road

93
00:06:04,411 --> 00:06:07,213
since uh... yesterday,

94
00:06:07,213 --> 00:06:10,283
and it's already today, so...

95
00:06:10,283 --> 00:06:12,752
Poet: Time passes.

96
00:06:12,752 --> 00:06:14,320
Listen...

97
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,356
Time passes.

98
00:06:16,356 --> 00:06:18,925
Come closer now.

99
00:06:18,925 --> 00:06:21,461
Only you can hear the houses

100
00:06:21,461 --> 00:06:24,731
sleeping in the streets
in the slow deep salt

101
00:06:24,731 --> 00:06:28,101
and silent black,
bandaged night.

102
00:06:28,101 --> 00:06:31,938
Only you can see it,
in the blinded bedrooms,

103
00:06:31,938 --> 00:06:34,741
the combs and petticoats
over the chairs,

104
00:06:34,741 --> 00:06:37,744
the jugs and basins,
the glasses of teeth.

105
00:06:37,744 --> 00:06:41,737
Thou Shalt Not on the wall.

106
00:06:42,282 --> 00:06:46,275
Endurance.

107
00:06:48,855 --> 00:06:52,292
Man: Responsibility
is a necessity for happiness.

108
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:54,794
Poet: and the yellowing
dickybird-watching

109
00:06:54,794 --> 00:06:58,787
pictures of the dead.

110
00:07:05,772 --> 00:07:08,842
Poet: cat's purr in the kitchen.

111
00:07:08,842 --> 00:07:11,077
It smells like shit.

112
00:07:11,077 --> 00:07:13,279
Is it an overdose
or a suicide?

113
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:17,272
An overdose is suicide.

114
00:07:17,817 --> 00:07:21,810
I'm a man, Greta.
One of the last goddamn men.

115
00:07:22,922 --> 00:07:25,959
Unfortunately,
there's only three of us left.

116
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:28,528
Unfortunately,
we're all drunks.

117
00:07:28,528 --> 00:07:32,365
And that ain't nothing new.

118
00:07:32,365 --> 00:07:36,369
Nothing new.

119
00:07:36,369 --> 00:07:40,073
You're born in this world
and they shove it down your throat.

120
00:07:40,073 --> 00:07:42,008
Poet:
Only you can hear and see,

121
00:07:42,008 --> 00:07:45,378
behind the eyes
of the sleepers,

122
00:07:45,378 --> 00:07:49,182
the movements and countries
and colors

123
00:07:49,182 --> 00:07:51,184
and rainbows and...

124
00:07:51,184 --> 00:07:54,120
First, I want to go
to 42nd Street.

125
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,756
Then, I want to go
to Harlem.

126
00:07:56,756 --> 00:07:58,124
Hey!

127
00:07:58,124 --> 00:07:59,292
Hey!

128
00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:03,263
Hey, there we are.

129
00:08:03,263 --> 00:08:05,231
I feel fucking sick.

130
00:08:05,231 --> 00:08:08,234
Poet: and flight and fall
and despairs and big seas...

131
00:08:08,234 --> 00:08:10,170
Driver: Do you know
where we're going?

132
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:14,163
- I think so.
- All right.

133
00:08:14,574 --> 00:08:17,377
I gave everyone 100%.

134
00:08:17,377 --> 00:08:19,279
Whatever they take away
is their business.

135
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:23,272
(knocking on door)

136
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:27,787
- Who is it?
- Man: Thank God! Listen.

137
00:08:27,787 --> 00:08:31,090
I lost my key to the bathroom.
Can I use your key?

138
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,926
- Please...
- I'm sleeping.

139
00:08:32,926 --> 00:08:36,162
- I'm sorry...
- I don't have the key.

140
00:08:36,162 --> 00:08:37,430
(knocks again)

141
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,132
Please!

142
00:08:39,132 --> 00:08:42,001
Hello? Hello?!

143
00:08:42,001 --> 00:08:45,994
Hi.

144
00:09:02,255 --> 00:09:06,248
No. Go away.

145
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,495
(knocks again)

146
00:09:09,495 --> 00:09:11,497
Leave me alone.

147
00:09:11,497 --> 00:09:13,233
Another man: Audrey?

148
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:14,567
Val?

149
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:18,560
Val?

150
00:09:24,644 --> 00:09:27,213
- Goddamn slob.
- Talk about beautiful.

151
00:09:27,213 --> 00:09:31,150
I'll tell you about beautiful.
This place used to be beautiful.

152
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:35,143
Everybody lived here.
Everybody who was anybody.

153
00:09:36,222 --> 00:09:39,525
It's fucking disgusting.

154
00:09:39,525 --> 00:09:43,518
There's vomit everywhere.

155
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,908
Audrey:
I missed you.

156
00:09:54,908 --> 00:09:57,410
I didn't think
you were coming back.

157
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:01,414
Where have you been?
Are you gonna stay?

158
00:10:01,414 --> 00:10:02,515
Cop #1:
Look at this...

159
00:10:02,515 --> 00:10:04,217
songs.

160
00:10:04,217 --> 00:10:08,210
There's tons of them.

161
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,292
Psst.

162
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:14,627
Pills for epilepsy.

163
00:10:14,627 --> 00:10:18,620
Nyquil bottles, empty...
all empty.

164
00:10:19,065 --> 00:10:22,502
Cop #2: This guy must have had
some sore throat.

165
00:10:22,502 --> 00:10:25,071
You don't believe me,
but I'm telling you,

166
00:10:25,071 --> 00:10:28,641
40 years ago this place
was beautiful.

167
00:10:28,641 --> 00:10:31,277
It still is from the outside.

168
00:10:31,277 --> 00:10:34,948
Some frog from New Orleans
built it for artist types.

169
00:10:34,948 --> 00:10:37,583
Supposed to be a hotel
for artists.

170
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,018
Cop #1: Artists...

171
00:10:39,018 --> 00:10:41,187
shit.

172
00:10:41,187 --> 00:10:44,090
Hotel for drug addicts.

173
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:48,083
(woman yelling)

174
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:58,126
(woman still yelling)

175
00:11:12,485 --> 00:11:15,555
(woman screaming)

176
00:11:15,555 --> 00:11:19,359
There was a fire here last week
and nobody told me.

177
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:22,395
I go to the store
to get a pack of cigarettes,

178
00:11:22,395 --> 00:11:24,731
and there are all these people
in the lobby.

179
00:11:24,731 --> 00:11:28,724
I asked them why and they said
because there was a fire.

180
00:11:29,068 --> 00:11:33,061
And no one told me!

181
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:38,533
I'm staying this time.

182
00:12:21,387 --> 00:12:24,624
§ Promising §

183
00:12:24,624 --> 00:12:28,617
§ Promising... §

191
00:13:04,297 --> 00:13:07,633
Man: Yeah.

192
00:13:07,633 --> 00:13:11,637
I don't know, I must have
passed out from the fumes.

193
00:13:11,637 --> 00:13:15,475
My stove is still leaking.

194
00:13:15,475 --> 00:13:19,178
Might have been that.

195
00:13:19,178 --> 00:13:23,171
Why don't you fix my stove...

196
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:28,154
and then you'll get
your painting?

197
00:13:28,154 --> 00:13:32,147
I said tomorrow.

198
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:37,452
I said tomorrow!
I meant tomorrow.

199
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:44,292
Yes.

200
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:47,206
I don't feel
like they're pep talks,

201
00:13:47,206 --> 00:13:49,242
I feel like they're more...

202
00:13:49,242 --> 00:13:53,235
annoying disturbances.

203
00:13:53,546 --> 00:13:57,539
Yes.

204
00:13:59,218 --> 00:14:01,787
Okay.

205
00:14:01,787 --> 00:14:05,224
You try painting and then...

206
00:14:05,224 --> 00:14:09,217
you give me advice, okay?

207
00:14:10,196 --> 00:14:12,698
Yeah.

208
00:14:12,698 --> 00:14:15,201
Yeah.

209
00:14:15,201 --> 00:14:18,871
Can you hang on one second?

210
00:14:18,871 --> 00:14:22,341
Man: 10 years ago
I was living in San Diego

211
00:14:22,341 --> 00:14:25,444
off and on.

212
00:14:25,444 --> 00:14:29,437
Spent a lot of time
in Carmel and Big Sur.

213
00:14:30,483 --> 00:14:34,476
I ran naked and fasted.

214
00:14:34,754 --> 00:14:38,658
I found the lightness
of existence.

215
00:14:38,658 --> 00:14:42,651
I freed myself from
all of society's burdens.

216
00:14:43,162 --> 00:14:47,155
I let the spirits
pass through me.

217
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:51,826
I let the spirits talk to me,
all that shit.

218
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:57,232
I was into candles, and incense
and the death of JFK,

219
00:14:57,276 --> 00:14:59,779
and Martin Luther King,

220
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:03,772
and Bobby and Malcolm X.

221
00:15:05,851 --> 00:15:08,688
This is where I'm coming from.

222
00:15:08,688 --> 00:15:12,681
It may or may not be important.

223
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,194
Val: For Christ's sake, man.

224
00:15:15,194 --> 00:15:17,396
Look at you.

225
00:15:17,396 --> 00:15:21,000
I got $2,000 out of it.

226
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,704
What happened to your dog?

227
00:15:24,704 --> 00:15:28,374
Rock, you mean.

228
00:15:28,374 --> 00:15:31,477
Died.

229
00:15:31,477 --> 00:15:33,846
What happened was...

230
00:15:33,846 --> 00:15:37,839
I was working for my uncle
in my uncle's shop.

231
00:15:38,217 --> 00:15:40,486
- Uncle Vern.
- Shit.

232
00:15:40,486 --> 00:15:42,655
You're not there,
and everyone hates me.

233
00:15:42,655 --> 00:15:44,490
I'm doing a lot of drugs,

234
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:47,493
I'm under the gun.
I found out you were here,

235
00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:51,486
and me and Rock
got on the train, and...

236
00:15:54,934 --> 00:15:57,670
(stuttering)

237
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:00,673
fell on me.

238
00:16:00,673 --> 00:16:03,342
Or I fell off of it.

239
00:16:03,342 --> 00:16:06,846
I don't remember.

240
00:16:06,846 --> 00:16:10,016
I came to The Chelsea
to help a friend.

241
00:16:10,016 --> 00:16:12,585
A friend who was beyond help.

242
00:16:12,585 --> 00:16:16,022
And I never left.

243
00:16:16,022 --> 00:16:19,458
If it wasn't for this place,
I wouldn't live in New York.

244
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:22,695
For the first year
I rarely left my room.

245
00:16:22,695 --> 00:16:25,464
I had spent years, man.

246
00:16:25,464 --> 00:16:27,967
Years living with the vibe!

247
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:30,002
How's the wife doing?

248
00:16:30,002 --> 00:16:31,570
Cute...

249
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:34,807
socialite, Brandy Alexander?

250
00:16:34,807 --> 00:16:37,543
Does she wear lace for you?

251
00:16:37,543 --> 00:16:40,379
Is it like a French movie?

252
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:42,281
It's okay.

253
00:16:42,281 --> 00:16:44,417
I love her.

254
00:16:44,417 --> 00:16:46,385
You're a weak man.

255
00:16:46,385 --> 00:16:48,621
Yeah, well...

256
00:16:48,621 --> 00:16:50,356
You should come back with me.

257
00:16:50,356 --> 00:16:52,558
You're miserable.

258
00:16:52,558 --> 00:16:55,828
- Where are you going?
- Going to Mexico.

259
00:16:55,828 --> 00:16:59,821
Getting lost in Mexico,

260
00:17:00,099 --> 00:17:02,001
under the gun.
But I am.

261
00:17:02,001 --> 00:17:05,838
Guess what? You are too,
only you don't admit it,

262
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:09,831
you've weakened for lacy,
soft pleasures.

263
00:17:11,477 --> 00:17:15,470
...And they found me.

264
00:17:15,648 --> 00:17:17,650
I wasn't looking.

265
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,652
I wasn't asking.

266
00:17:19,652 --> 00:17:23,645
It wasn't God,
it wasn't Buddha.

267
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:28,483
It was a conversation.

268
00:17:28,627 --> 00:17:31,664
I had a fucking conversation...

269
00:17:31,664 --> 00:17:34,133
with Dylan Thomas.

270
00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:35,701
Well...

271
00:17:35,701 --> 00:17:39,694
I think about leaving
all the time.

272
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:44,332
I love her,
you don't understand that.

273
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:48,481
You're right.
I'm probably the devil.

274
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:52,474
You came here to hear this.

275
00:17:55,621 --> 00:17:58,090
You've heard his sounds,

276
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:02,083
you've felt his feelings,
this is sacred.

277
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:07,633
We've all got
to come together...

278
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:09,935
and realize...

279
00:18:09,935 --> 00:18:12,371
that ghosts

280
00:18:12,371 --> 00:18:15,040
are our most valuable resource.

281
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,043
We need them as much
as they need us.

282
00:18:18,043 --> 00:18:20,045
They stay here at The Chelsea

283
00:18:20,045 --> 00:18:24,038
because this is the only place
people listen to them.

284
00:18:25,918 --> 00:18:29,911
Their blood is on the walls.

285
00:18:57,683 --> 00:19:00,953
Hey, are you Bob?

286
00:19:00,953 --> 00:19:03,422
Hey, are you Bob Dylan?

287
00:19:03,422 --> 00:19:05,891
By any chance
can I kiss your boot?

288
00:19:05,891 --> 00:19:07,092
Fuck off.

289
00:19:07,092 --> 00:19:11,085
You're from Minnesota, aren't you?
You must be him.

290
00:19:11,197 --> 00:19:13,432
Seriously, fuck off.

291
00:19:13,432 --> 00:19:15,167
Bob! Bob! Bob!

292
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:17,837
Listen, you're not
gonna believe this.

293
00:19:17,837 --> 00:19:20,873
I'm down in the lobby, right?

294
00:19:20,873 --> 00:19:22,475
Yeah?

295
00:19:22,475 --> 00:19:25,177
There's this guy
putting up a painting,

296
00:19:25,177 --> 00:19:27,546
so I'm helping him
with the ladder.

297
00:19:27,546 --> 00:19:30,015
He tells me he lives here

298
00:19:30,015 --> 00:19:32,818
in a room just like this one,

299
00:19:32,818 --> 00:19:36,789
but he's got it all
for free.

300
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:39,959
All he's gotta do is give
a painting to the manager.

301
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:41,861
This guy's...

302
00:19:41,861 --> 00:19:43,863
bullshitting me about

303
00:19:43,863 --> 00:19:47,633
how he's an artist,
and the manager understands,

304
00:19:47,633 --> 00:19:50,736
and as long as he's creating,

305
00:19:50,736 --> 00:19:54,640
he can live here.

306
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,842
- The guy was lying.
- That's what I thought,

307
00:19:56,842 --> 00:19:58,277
but...

308
00:19:58,277 --> 00:20:01,747
the manager was standing
fucking right there.

309
00:20:01,747 --> 00:20:04,016
What did it look like?

310
00:20:04,016 --> 00:20:06,852
- What?
- The painting, dumbshit.

311
00:20:06,852 --> 00:20:08,988
That's the best part.
It's ugly as shit.

312
00:20:08,988 --> 00:20:10,723
I could have done it, easy.

313
00:20:10,723 --> 00:20:14,716
A whole bunch of colors
thrown all around.

314
00:20:14,827 --> 00:20:16,495
I don't know.

315
00:20:16,495 --> 00:20:18,497
I don't know...

316
00:20:18,497 --> 00:20:22,490
This place fucking kills me.

Woman: I never had it before.
Somebody gave it to me.

327
00:20:59,572 --> 00:21:03,108
- Sure.
- I'll get you some more honey.

328
00:21:03,108 --> 00:21:05,744

329

Yeah.

330
00:21:07,313 --> 00:21:09,214
I dropped...
this is sticky.

331
00:21:09,214 --> 00:21:12,217
Do you have a sponge?

332
00:21:12,217 --> 00:21:13,752
I do.

333
00:21:13,752 --> 00:21:15,588
Here.

334
00:21:15,588 --> 00:21:19,581
You should get up
on the counter.

335
00:21:28,734 --> 00:21:31,604
I hated school.

336
00:21:31,604 --> 00:21:33,973
I never wanted to go.

337
00:21:33,973 --> 00:21:36,008
I wanted to drop out, even.

338
00:21:36,008 --> 00:21:37,876
Why didn't you?

339
00:21:37,876 --> 00:21:41,869
A teacher...
he drove a motorcycle.

340
00:21:44,116 --> 00:21:47,286
Who did?

341
00:21:47,286 --> 00:21:49,288
The teacher,

342
00:21:49,288 --> 00:21:53,281
not me.

343
00:21:54,226 --> 00:21:56,629
Where's your garbage?

344
00:21:56,629 --> 00:22:00,622
Um... here.

345
00:22:16,949 --> 00:22:18,784
Just...

346
00:22:18,784 --> 00:22:22,777
(giggles)

347
00:22:26,358 --> 00:22:30,351
Sink.

348
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:43,208
I have this reoccurring dream.

349
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:44,843
Yeah?

350
00:22:44,843 --> 00:22:47,646
Yeah.

351
00:22:47,646 --> 00:22:51,639
I'm a in cold water flat
in the East Village...

352
00:22:53,052 --> 00:22:54,953
and it's cold...

353
00:22:54,953 --> 00:22:58,190
and bare-bones empty,
I mean nothing.

354
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,359
Yeah?

355
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:04,352
Yeah.

356
00:23:06,732 --> 00:23:10,725
And that dream
reminds me of you.

357
00:23:12,337 --> 00:23:16,330
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

358
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:18,877
It's kind of sad.

359
00:23:18,877 --> 00:23:22,870
I'm all alone in the dream.

360
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:27,152
It's kind of sad.

361
00:23:27,152 --> 00:23:31,145
Yeah.

362
00:23:39,765 --> 00:23:43,758
Thank you.

363
00:23:49,374 --> 00:23:53,145
I should go.

364
00:23:53,145 --> 00:23:54,313
Umm...

365
00:23:54,313 --> 00:23:58,306
all right.

366
00:24:00,052 --> 00:24:03,856
Are you gonna walk me
to the door?

367
00:24:03,856 --> 00:24:05,190
Sure.

368
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:08,994
Just...

369
00:24:08,994 --> 00:24:11,096
Jump up...

370
00:24:11,096 --> 00:24:12,931
Okay.
Are you ready?

371
00:24:12,931 --> 00:24:16,924
Yep.

372
00:24:17,302 --> 00:24:19,238
- Are you okay?
- Um-huh.

373
00:24:19,238 --> 00:24:21,974
§ Toothy smile §

374
00:24:21,974 --> 00:24:24,276
§ Curly style §

375
00:24:24,276 --> 00:24:26,378
§ In the backyard... §

376
00:24:26,378 --> 00:24:28,180
(knocking on door)

377
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,015
Who is it?

378
00:24:30,015 --> 00:24:34,008
- Man: Shoeshine.
- Come on in.

379
00:24:37,956 --> 00:24:40,159
I'm gonna ask you

380
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,294
a few questions.

381
00:24:42,294 --> 00:24:44,429
If you pay me enough,
I'll answer your questions.

382
00:24:44,429 --> 00:24:47,466
Not that kind.

383
00:24:47,466 --> 00:24:50,202
Just simple questions.

384
00:24:50,202 --> 00:24:54,195
- Like what?
- What does O.T.B. mean to you?

385
00:24:56,175 --> 00:24:59,178
Off Track Betting.

386
00:24:59,178 --> 00:25:00,445
Nice.

387
00:25:00,445 --> 00:25:02,047
Brilliant.

388
00:25:02,047 --> 00:25:04,082
It doesn't take a genius.

389
00:25:04,082 --> 00:25:06,318
Settle down.

390
00:25:06,318 --> 00:25:10,311
Settle down.

391
00:25:11,156 --> 00:25:15,149
There's an O.T.B. next door.

392
00:25:16,428 --> 00:25:20,332
I'm gonna give you
an envelope.

393
00:25:20,332 --> 00:25:24,303
You don't look inside
that envelope.

394
00:25:24,303 --> 00:25:25,971
You got that?

395
00:25:25,971 --> 00:25:27,372
I got you.

396
00:25:27,372 --> 00:25:29,808
I win.

397
00:25:29,808 --> 00:25:33,801
You win.

398
00:25:33,979 --> 00:25:35,981
What if you lose?

399
00:25:35,981 --> 00:25:38,951
(jazz plays)

400
00:25:38,951 --> 00:25:41,153
You promised me!

401
00:25:41,153 --> 00:25:45,146
I know.

402
00:25:50,562 --> 00:25:52,464
Well?

403
00:25:52,464 --> 00:25:56,457
I'll go wake him up.

404
00:25:57,502 --> 00:26:01,473
You gave me your word.

405
00:26:01,473 --> 00:26:05,466
I'm sorry.

406
00:26:06,311 --> 00:26:08,180
Yo!

407
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,082
Yo.

408
00:26:10,082 --> 00:26:12,351
- Ouch!
- Get up!

409
00:26:12,351 --> 00:26:14,186
Get up!

410
00:26:14,186 --> 00:26:16,288
Come on.
Get the fuck up.

411
00:26:16,288 --> 00:26:18,490
- Relax.
- No, you relax. Get up.

412
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:21,927
Let go of me.

413
00:26:21,927 --> 00:26:23,662
Let go. Get...

414
00:26:23,662 --> 00:26:27,655
I'm up.

415
00:26:29,601 --> 00:26:31,670
Whoa!
Come here, hot shot.

416
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:34,673
Come on back.

417
00:26:34,673 --> 00:26:38,043
You like Billie Holiday?

418
00:26:38,043 --> 00:26:39,978
Yeah.

419
00:26:39,978 --> 00:26:42,014
Come on over.

420
00:26:42,014 --> 00:26:44,116
We're gonna listen
to Billie,

421
00:26:44,116 --> 00:26:48,109
she's gonna tell you
who to bet on.

422
00:26:48,186 --> 00:26:50,923
I don't want to.

423
00:26:50,923 --> 00:26:53,191
No Billie, no envelope.

424
00:26:53,191 --> 00:26:57,184
Give me my fucking crutches.

425
00:26:57,596 --> 00:26:59,665
Hi, Audrey.

426
00:26:59,665 --> 00:27:02,434
Hi.
You sure are looking...

427
00:27:02,434 --> 00:27:05,070
(door slams)

428
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:07,372
Sure are looking pretty today.

429
00:27:07,372 --> 00:27:11,076
You should be real happy.
You fucked up everything for me.

430
00:27:11,076 --> 00:27:14,079
You fucked up things for me
a long time ago.

431
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:17,549
I'm not going with you,
even if she kicks me out.

432
00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:19,718
She'll kick you out.

433
00:27:19,718 --> 00:27:23,711
Eventually.

434
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:27,526
Sayonara.

435
00:27:27,526 --> 00:27:31,430
Hey, lilac-lily-girl.

436
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:35,423
It's all safe.

437
00:27:40,205 --> 00:27:43,942
$43.

438
00:27:43,942 --> 00:27:46,044
What?

439
00:27:46,044 --> 00:27:48,213
That's all we got.

440
00:27:48,213 --> 00:27:50,115
So?

441
00:27:50,115 --> 00:27:53,185
"So?"
We're starving here.

442
00:27:53,185 --> 00:27:57,178
Yeah...

443
00:27:59,124 --> 00:28:01,126
Maybe I should go.

444
00:28:01,126 --> 00:28:03,628
Oh, I see.

445
00:28:03,628 --> 00:28:05,664
- No, you don't.
- I think I do.

446
00:28:05,664 --> 00:28:07,666
It's hard to see you
live like this.

447
00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:10,335
Like what?
We're just living.

448
00:28:10,335 --> 00:28:12,738
A lot of people
live like this.

449
00:28:12,738 --> 00:28:16,475
- Starving?
- Yeah, and worse.

450
00:28:16,475 --> 00:28:18,543
The real question is...

451
00:28:18,543 --> 00:28:21,279
What?

452
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,749
- You lied to me.
- I didn't lie.

453
00:28:23,749 --> 00:28:26,151
Okay.

454
00:28:26,151 --> 00:28:30,144
You're not gonna kick me out,
are you?

455
00:28:32,324 --> 00:28:35,160
No way.

456
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:39,153
Come here.

457
00:28:46,204 --> 00:28:48,507
Audrey's voice:
Oh, may it come,

458
00:28:48,507 --> 00:28:51,009
the time of love,

459
00:28:51,009 --> 00:28:53,779
the time we'd be enamored of.

460
00:28:53,779 --> 00:28:56,114
I've been patient too long,

461
00:28:56,114 --> 00:28:58,183
my memory is dead,

462
00:28:58,183 --> 00:29:02,187
all fears and all wrongs
to the heavens have fled,

463
00:29:02,187 --> 00:29:06,180
while all my veins burst
with a sickly thirst.

464
00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:09,628
Together: Oh, may it come,
the time of love...

465
00:29:09,628 --> 00:29:12,197
Val's voice:
...the time we'd be enamored of.

466
00:29:12,197 --> 00:29:14,533
Audrey's voice:
Oh, may it come,

467
00:29:14,533 --> 00:29:17,169
the time of love,

468
00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:21,162
the time we'd be enamored of.

469
00:29:27,479 --> 00:29:30,582
§ I love you §

470
00:29:30,582 --> 00:29:34,575
§ What a little moonlight
can do §

471
00:29:36,788 --> 00:29:39,091
§ Wait a while §

472
00:29:39,091 --> 00:29:43,084
§ Till a little moonbeam
comes leaping through §

473
00:29:44,129 --> 00:29:48,122
§ You get bold... §

474
00:30:01,379 --> 00:30:03,482
Are you in the dark?

475
00:30:03,482 --> 00:30:05,584
Yes, actually I am.

476
00:30:05,584 --> 00:30:09,577
- You mean the light.
- I know.

477
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:17,129
Should I come in
or stay here?

478
00:30:17,129 --> 00:30:21,122
(giggles)

479
00:30:22,267 --> 00:30:26,104
Oh...

480
00:30:26,104 --> 00:30:29,274
it's bad for you today,
isn't it?

481
00:30:29,274 --> 00:30:33,267
Um-hmm.

482
00:30:33,612 --> 00:30:36,615
Wait a minute, let's...

483
00:30:36,615 --> 00:30:39,417
make it better.

484
00:30:39,417 --> 00:30:41,620
How's that?

485
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,522
Um-hmm.

486
00:30:43,522 --> 00:30:46,491
You want an aspirin?
I'm gonna have one myself.

487
00:30:46,491 --> 00:30:48,426
No, maybe later.

488
00:30:48,426 --> 00:30:52,419
- I'll get it.
- No, no.

489
00:30:55,567 --> 00:30:58,503
You know what I've been
thinking about lately?

490
00:30:58,503 --> 00:31:01,873
No. What?

491
00:31:01,873 --> 00:31:04,876
What have you
been thinking about?

492
00:31:04,876 --> 00:31:08,513
About how my father used to put
gasoline behind his ear,

493
00:31:08,513 --> 00:31:10,515
like perfume,

494
00:31:10,515 --> 00:31:13,285
so when he held a girl close
at a dance,

495
00:31:13,285 --> 00:31:15,487
she'd know he had a car.

496
00:31:15,487 --> 00:31:16,555
Yeah?

497
00:31:16,555 --> 00:31:19,958
That's what I was thinking about
as you were walking up the stairs.

498
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:21,927
Lately?

499
00:31:21,927 --> 00:31:25,920
Here, sit down.

500
00:31:26,932 --> 00:31:30,925
It's easier for me to stand,
but you shouldn't have to.

501
00:31:31,369 --> 00:31:33,238
Uh-huh.

502
00:31:33,238 --> 00:31:34,372
What?

503
00:31:34,372 --> 00:31:36,808
Hello.
Nothing, nothing.

504
00:31:36,808 --> 00:31:40,412
I'm on to you,
you know?

505
00:31:40,412 --> 00:31:42,614
There's a word in German.

506
00:31:42,614 --> 00:31:44,683
- Which one?
- One word.

507
00:31:44,683 --> 00:31:46,918
It means...

508
00:31:46,918 --> 00:31:50,255
a near paralyzing fear

509
00:31:50,255 --> 00:31:54,226
of not being able
to connect.

510
00:31:54,226 --> 00:31:56,628
In America we call it fear.
One word.

511
00:31:56,628 --> 00:31:59,331
You know what I'm talking about.

512
00:31:59,331 --> 00:32:02,334
Instead of talking about
that bottle of whiskey...

513
00:32:02,334 --> 00:32:03,902
Yes, yes.

514
00:32:03,902 --> 00:32:07,872
I'm not drinking it.
My glass is just for water.

515
00:32:07,872 --> 00:32:10,909
You got the whole bottle for me,
myself, alone?

516
00:32:10,909 --> 00:32:14,879
Yeah. I figured it was either that,
or a philosophy lesson.

517
00:32:14,879 --> 00:32:18,872
I don't want a lesson.
I'm in no shape for it.

518
00:32:19,784 --> 00:32:21,653
No lessons.

519
00:32:21,653 --> 00:32:25,646
All right.

520
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:34,799
Well?
Are you gonna stand?

521
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,835
Are you gonna sit?
Want me to stand?

522
00:32:36,835 --> 00:32:40,828
No.
I'll sit down with you.

523
00:32:43,675 --> 00:32:46,778
Here's to those fields
that I won time.

524
00:32:46,778 --> 00:32:50,482
Oh, no.

525
00:32:50,482 --> 00:32:52,617
To cowardice.

526
00:32:52,617 --> 00:32:55,287
No.

527
00:32:55,287 --> 00:32:56,488
To "no."

528
00:32:56,488 --> 00:32:59,758
No.

529
00:32:59,758 --> 00:33:02,360
This is a good way
to get sober.

530
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:06,353
We'll disagree
on what to drink to.

531
00:33:09,034 --> 00:33:12,070
Here's to everyone...

532
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:15,073
thinking that they know
everything,

533
00:33:15,073 --> 00:33:18,043
when they don't know
anything at all.

534
00:33:18,043 --> 00:33:20,512
What are you talking about...

535
00:33:20,512 --> 00:33:24,049
really?

536
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:27,852
Jealousy and what
a horrible trait it is.

537
00:33:27,852 --> 00:33:31,556
But you don't possess it?

538
00:33:31,556 --> 00:33:34,559
No, I have my own set
of qualities

539
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,995
that aren't so admirable.

540
00:33:36,995 --> 00:33:39,097
Let's drink to those.

541
00:33:39,097 --> 00:33:41,066
Maybe.

542
00:33:41,066 --> 00:33:43,902
- What are they?
- You know them.

543
00:33:43,902 --> 00:33:46,071
- I don't.
- You do!

544
00:33:46,071 --> 00:33:49,074
The big one is impatience.

545
00:33:49,074 --> 00:33:51,910
- That doesn't bother me.
- It's a horrible fault.

546
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:54,979
Huge fault.

547
00:33:54,979 --> 00:33:57,716
You want to drink
to your impatience?

548
00:33:57,716 --> 00:34:00,385
Yes, and...

549
00:34:00,385 --> 00:34:03,321
to cowardice.

550
00:34:03,321 --> 00:34:05,590
All right.

551
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:08,693
All right.

552
00:34:08,693 --> 00:34:10,695
I got off easy.

553
00:34:10,695 --> 00:34:13,932
I have a lot worse qualities.

554
00:34:13,932 --> 00:34:16,968
No, you don't,
cowardice is the worst,

555
00:34:16,968 --> 00:34:20,939
especially in a man.

556
00:34:20,939 --> 00:34:24,932
Wow.

557
00:34:25,777 --> 00:34:28,113
I did something bad
the other day.

558
00:34:28,113 --> 00:34:30,448
You didn't take a drink.

559
00:34:30,448 --> 00:34:32,550
I told you I'm not drinking.

560
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:36,543
So what's the bad thing
you did?

561
00:34:37,355 --> 00:34:40,458
It's nothing.

562
00:34:40,458 --> 00:34:42,427
All right,

563
00:34:42,427 --> 00:34:44,863
you'll tell me about it later,

564
00:34:44,863 --> 00:34:48,856
and I'll make sure to tell you
everything is all right.

565
00:34:49,934 --> 00:34:53,705
And you'll feel much better.

566
00:34:53,705 --> 00:34:56,441
- I feel better already.
- Yeah.

567
00:34:56,441 --> 00:34:58,443
You know what
would be better even?

568
00:34:58,443 --> 00:35:00,512
- What?
- Better than a drink?

569
00:35:00,512 --> 00:35:01,813
What?

570
00:35:01,813 --> 00:35:04,149
If you rubbed my back.

571
00:35:04,149 --> 00:35:08,142
Okay.

572
00:35:13,725 --> 00:35:17,718
Oh God,
why am I here?

573
00:35:17,962 --> 00:35:21,955
I don't want to be here.

574
00:35:22,167 --> 00:35:25,036
We could help each other.

575
00:35:25,036 --> 00:35:28,540
I want to believe that,
but I don't.

576
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,676
You told me a long time ago

577
00:35:31,676 --> 00:35:34,579
that I didn't have any faith.

578
00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:36,581
You were right.

579
00:35:36,581 --> 00:35:39,417
I finally realized
what you meant by that.

580
00:35:39,417 --> 00:35:41,453
I didn't mean that.

581
00:35:41,453 --> 00:35:45,023
It's true.

582
00:35:45,023 --> 00:35:48,893
You can look at me in the eyes
and tell me you don't have faith?

583
00:35:48,893 --> 00:35:51,129
If I could look at you
in the eyes?

584
00:35:51,129 --> 00:35:53,031
Yes.

585
00:35:53,031 --> 00:35:54,899
I...

586
00:35:54,899 --> 00:35:56,835
Yes.

587
00:35:56,835 --> 00:35:59,571
It just seems...

588
00:35:59,571 --> 00:36:01,906
so impossible.

589
00:36:01,906 --> 00:36:05,899
- What seems impossible?
- You!

590
00:36:07,745 --> 00:36:10,648
Do I make you feel safe?

591
00:36:10,648 --> 00:36:12,617
I feel...

592
00:36:12,617 --> 00:36:16,588
I feel safe,
but I'm not.

593
00:36:16,588 --> 00:36:18,590
Why not?

594
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:21,726
Because when I look at you,

595
00:36:21,726 --> 00:36:25,719
I can't get out.

596
00:36:26,464 --> 00:36:30,457
I get lost.

597
00:36:31,236 --> 00:36:35,229
- Completely?
- You know.

598
00:36:35,573 --> 00:36:38,142
You can have me completely.

599
00:36:38,142 --> 00:36:40,512
- No. No.
- You know that, right?

600
00:36:40,512 --> 00:36:42,280
You're wrong.

601
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,816
We could help each other.

602
00:36:44,816 --> 00:36:47,652
I want to believe that...

603
00:36:47,652 --> 00:36:49,988
but I don't.

604
00:36:49,988 --> 00:36:53,091
It's the truth,
whether you believe it or not.

605
00:36:53,091 --> 00:36:57,084
You're no good to yourself
and you hide it from me.

606
00:36:59,531 --> 00:37:02,567
Why can't you understand that
when you hurt yourself

607
00:37:02,567 --> 00:37:05,003
you might as well hurt me?

608
00:37:05,003 --> 00:37:07,038
If you...

609
00:37:07,038 --> 00:37:09,507
just turn it around,
I mean...

610
00:37:09,507 --> 00:37:13,500
you'd have no patience for me
if I destroyed myself.

611
00:37:13,645 --> 00:37:16,915
How would you feel?
Would you feel loved?

612
00:37:16,915 --> 00:37:20,908
Would you feel like
you had me completely?

613
00:37:20,985 --> 00:37:22,954
You do hurt yourself.

614
00:37:22,954 --> 00:37:24,322
How?

615
00:37:24,322 --> 00:37:28,315
By being with me.

616
00:37:30,094 --> 00:37:32,897
You came to save me,
didn't you?

617
00:37:32,897 --> 00:37:36,034
Of course I did.

618
00:37:36,034 --> 00:37:39,203
At least I haven't had
a drink in years.

619
00:37:39,203 --> 00:37:42,173
Yeah, sure.

620
00:37:42,173 --> 00:37:44,709
At least
I don't need it tonight.

621
00:37:44,709 --> 00:37:46,578
Well, I might.

622
00:37:46,578 --> 00:37:48,846
Nah, you don't.

623
00:37:48,846 --> 00:37:49,881
Yes.

624
00:37:49,881 --> 00:37:53,874
Come here.

625
00:38:02,226 --> 00:38:05,263
Poet:
Dusk and ceremonial dust.

626
00:38:05,263 --> 00:38:08,333
and night's first darkening snow,

627
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:11,202
and sleep of birds
drift under and through

628
00:38:11,202 --> 00:38:14,939
the live dusk of
this place of love.

629
00:38:14,939 --> 00:38:17,075

630
00:38:17,075 --> 00:38:20,111

§ The cameras flashed... §

637
00:38:37,795 --> 00:38:41,788
It's getting dark.

638
00:38:43,167 --> 00:38:46,638
The light's over there.

639
00:38:46,638 --> 00:38:49,040
§ The band came out §

640
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,043

641
00:38:52,043 --> 00:38:54,212

642
00:38:54,212 --> 00:38:57,348
§ And the lights went blue §

643
00:38:57,348 --> 00:39:01,341
§ You stood alone
in the halo's haze... §

644
00:39:03,121 --> 00:39:05,990
Can I see your letters?

645
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:08,059
No.

646
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:10,995
- Please?
- No, it's against the rules.

647
00:39:10,995 --> 00:39:14,988
§ You were the lonely one §

648
00:39:17,835 --> 00:39:21,673

665
00:40:44,956 --> 00:40:48,949

"Trinity."

668
00:40:55,967 --> 00:40:57,735
Seven letters...

669
00:40:57,735 --> 00:41:00,938
63 points.

Holy trinity.

672
00:41:05,209 --> 00:41:09,202

It's just a coincidence.

693
00:42:53,117 --> 00:42:55,987
- When the two guitars come in,
- I... I...

694
00:42:55,987 --> 00:42:58,522
- It's pretty good.
- I screwed up.

695
00:42:58,522 --> 00:43:01,525
I think it's good,
after the chorus,

696
00:43:01,525 --> 00:43:05,518
if you stay
with the first progression.

697
00:43:06,464 --> 00:43:08,132
- Yeah.
- Great.

698
00:43:08,132 --> 00:43:10,534
That's nice.

699
00:43:10,534 --> 00:43:13,004
Poet:
When I was a windy boy and a bit

700
00:43:13,004 --> 00:43:16,374
and the black spit
of the chapel fold,

701
00:43:16,374 --> 00:43:19,143
Sighed the old ramrod,

702
00:43:19,143 --> 00:43:21,379
dying of women,

703
00:43:21,379 --> 00:43:24,415
I tiptoed shy
through the gooseberry wood

704
00:43:24,415 --> 00:43:28,052
The rude owl cried
like a tell-tale tit,

705
00:43:28,052 --> 00:43:29,520
and I skipped blushing

706
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,357
as the big girls
rolled ninepins

707
00:43:33,357 --> 00:43:36,193
down on the donkeys' common.

708
00:43:36,193 --> 00:43:38,996
And on the seesaw Sunday nights,

709
00:43:38,996 --> 00:43:41,699
I wooed whoever I would
with my wicked eye.

710
00:43:41,699 --> 00:43:44,502
The whole of the moon

711
00:43:44,502 --> 00:43:46,938
I could love and leave

712
00:43:46,938 --> 00:43:50,007
all the green leaved
little weddings' wives

713
00:43:50,007 --> 00:43:54,000
in the coal black bush
and let them grieve.

714
00:43:54,211 --> 00:43:56,480
MC: Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

715
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,050
(applause)

716
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:01,552
You're too kind.
You're too kind.

717
00:44:01,552 --> 00:44:04,722
You're too beautiful
and you're too kind.

718
00:44:04,722 --> 00:44:07,558
Not only are you beautiful
on the outside,

719
00:44:07,558 --> 00:44:09,593
let's face it,
you are,

720
00:44:09,593 --> 00:44:12,063
buy you're also beautiful
on the inside.

721
00:44:12,063 --> 00:44:16,056
Let's hear it for the waitress.
Drop another glass.

722
00:44:16,133 --> 00:44:18,703
Each one of you,
every one of you...

723
00:44:18,703 --> 00:44:21,272
you got a mind.
You know what they say?

724
00:44:21,272 --> 00:44:23,407
"A mind is a terrible thing
to waste."

725
00:44:23,407 --> 00:44:25,476
Which leads me to mind reduction.

726
00:44:25,476 --> 00:44:28,145
I'm the dream man,
the dream maker,

727
00:44:28,145 --> 00:44:30,748
the vision keeper,
your memory.

728
00:44:30,748 --> 00:44:32,750
All the world's nostalgia,

729
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:34,418
your dictionary,

730
00:44:34,418 --> 00:44:37,154
your encyclopedia.
Welcome. Hey!

731
00:44:37,154 --> 00:44:39,390
We've got a great show.

732
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:41,625
Sit back, relax...

733
00:44:41,625 --> 00:44:45,618
and go to sleep if you want to.
Just kidding.

734
00:44:47,298 --> 00:44:50,735
What I'm about to do
for you tonight,

735
00:44:50,735 --> 00:44:54,105
and this is a warning
of sorts,

736
00:44:54,105 --> 00:44:56,607
I'm gonna be with you.

737
00:44:56,607 --> 00:45:00,600
It's sort of a spell
I cast on people.

738
00:45:00,978 --> 00:45:04,515
I don't mean to do it,
but I do.

739
00:45:04,515 --> 00:45:06,617
Let's say,
for example...

740
00:45:06,617 --> 00:45:09,286
I'm your subconscious,

741
00:45:09,286 --> 00:45:12,623
and you...
you're my jailer.

742
00:45:12,623 --> 00:45:14,759
I do something wrong,
you hold the key.

743
00:45:14,759 --> 00:45:16,193
I don't even know you,

744
00:45:16,193 --> 00:45:19,463
but in the dark of the night
our eyes meet.

745
00:45:19,463 --> 00:45:23,456
And then, my friend,
I'm through.

746
00:45:23,567 --> 00:45:25,136
She...

747
00:45:25,136 --> 00:45:29,129
There's always a "she"...

748
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:33,310
And she is known as...

749
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:36,480
"the one who got away."

750
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,418
Bring it down, boys.

751
00:45:40,418 --> 00:45:44,288
About 4:00 a.m. the other night
I finished my vodka,

752
00:45:44,288 --> 00:45:46,257
the bottle, that is.

753
00:45:46,257 --> 00:45:48,592
In other words,
I'm referring to,

754
00:45:48,592 --> 00:45:51,529
the bottle that I finished.

755
00:45:51,529 --> 00:45:55,522
Liquor stores are closed,
so I'm contemplating a tatoo...

756
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,393
"The one who got away."

757
00:46:00,571 --> 00:46:04,375
Then I remembered
what a religious guy I am,

758
00:46:04,375 --> 00:46:08,045
and how our maker

759
00:46:08,045 --> 00:46:11,082
didn't intend for tatoos,

760
00:46:11,082 --> 00:46:14,218
with us being made
in His vision, and all that.

761
00:46:14,218 --> 00:46:18,211
Hey, that's good enough for me.

762
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:23,594
So I'm without a tatoo.

763
00:46:23,594 --> 00:46:27,587
I don't have a drink.

764
00:46:28,866 --> 00:46:31,569
And I don't have her.

765
00:46:31,569 --> 00:46:35,562
Time has a funny way...

766
00:46:36,407 --> 00:46:40,400
of finding us
in the strangest places.

767
00:46:47,885 --> 00:46:51,878
Terry?

768
00:46:53,757 --> 00:46:56,861
Hey, Terr.

769
00:46:56,861 --> 00:46:59,096
Hey, Terry.

770
00:46:59,096 --> 00:47:02,233
- Listen.
- Jesus, Ross.

771
00:47:02,233 --> 00:47:04,435
Where the fuck
have you been?

772
00:47:04,435 --> 00:47:06,871
We have
some nice guests here.

773
00:47:06,871 --> 00:47:08,772
You should be hospitable.

774
00:47:08,772 --> 00:47:10,608
They're mine, okay?

775
00:47:10,608 --> 00:47:12,810
Hey, this is...

776
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:16,280
my good friend Terry.
He came out here with me.

777
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:19,817
Terry, I'd like you
to meet...

778
00:47:19,817 --> 00:47:21,852
Lorna Doone.

779
00:47:21,852 --> 00:47:25,756
Um-huh.

780
00:47:25,756 --> 00:47:28,159
- What's your name?
- Wall.

781
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:30,761
Yeah, Wall!

782
00:47:30,761 --> 00:47:32,663
Wall and...

783
00:47:32,663 --> 00:47:35,499
this is all of us.

784
00:47:35,499 --> 00:47:38,502
It's very nice
to meet everybody.

785
00:47:38,502 --> 00:47:40,337
Yeah.

786
00:47:40,337 --> 00:47:44,308
They sure know how to breed them
out there with them cows.

787
00:47:44,308 --> 00:47:45,543
Yeah.

788
00:47:45,543 --> 00:47:48,245
Men are so ugly in New York.

789
00:47:48,245 --> 00:47:52,238
I know.

790
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:54,718
Wall: Got any more of these?

791
00:47:54,718 --> 00:47:57,855
Ross: You got an ID?

792
00:47:57,855 --> 00:47:59,690
Terry: Just give it to him.

793
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:03,627
What the hell?
The man wants a beer.

794
00:48:03,627 --> 00:48:06,330
I'm gonna go to sleep again.

795
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:08,199
Ross: I'm first.

796
00:48:08,199 --> 00:48:10,167
Here.
I got something for you.

797
00:48:10,167 --> 00:48:14,160
Get over here.

798
00:48:14,238 --> 00:48:16,240
Ross:
Come over to the quiet part.

799
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,877
Come over to the quiet part.

800
00:48:19,877 --> 00:48:23,870
Don't bother him.
He's quiet.

801
00:48:24,381 --> 00:48:26,183
Hey.

802
00:48:26,183 --> 00:48:30,176
Are you gonna sleep
with your clothes on?

803
00:48:30,221 --> 00:48:31,255
Yes.

804
00:48:31,255 --> 00:48:34,358
It's a game of rhythm.
It's called Thumper.

805
00:48:34,358 --> 00:48:37,461
Don't you want to get
under the covers?

806
00:48:37,461 --> 00:48:40,931
No.

807
00:48:40,931 --> 00:48:42,933
Can I tuck you in?

808
00:48:42,933 --> 00:48:43,934
Um...

809
00:48:43,934 --> 00:48:45,502
No.

810
00:48:45,502 --> 00:48:49,495
It's okay.

811
00:48:51,275 --> 00:48:55,268
Tired boy, huh?

812
00:48:55,579 --> 00:48:59,416
Hi.

813
00:48:59,416 --> 00:49:03,409
Why do they call you Lorna Doone?
Ain't that a cookie?

814
00:49:04,221 --> 00:49:08,214
You can call me
whatever you want.

815
00:49:08,592 --> 00:49:10,961
Do you want me
to sleep with you?

816
00:49:10,961 --> 00:49:12,763
Huh?

817
00:49:12,763 --> 00:49:16,756
No.

818
00:49:16,967 --> 00:49:20,960
Are you sure about that?

819
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:30,903
Hey.

820
00:49:48,932 --> 00:49:52,925
§ I was dreaming §

821
00:49:53,737 --> 00:49:57,730
§ Of the past §

822
00:50:00,344 --> 00:50:03,580

00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:07,573

825
00:50:14,992 --> 00:50:17,861
Bud's voice: Listen,
have a drink with me.

826
00:50:17,861 --> 00:50:21,799
I left some booze at your house
in the kitchen.

827
00:50:21,799 --> 00:50:23,400
Yeah.

828
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,501
Yeah.

829
00:50:24,501 --> 00:50:28,494
Go pour yourself a glass.

830
00:50:30,374 --> 00:50:32,810
Yeah, I got mine right here.

831
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:35,879
(glass clinks)

832
00:50:35,879 --> 00:50:38,382
(pouring drink)

833
00:50:38,382 --> 00:50:41,885
Don't mind if I do.

834
00:50:41,885 --> 00:50:45,878
Did you have a drink?

835
00:50:46,056 --> 00:50:49,393
Good. Yeah, it's here.

836
00:50:49,393 --> 00:50:51,395
Yeah.

837
00:50:51,395 --> 00:50:55,388
Yeah.

838
00:50:55,432 --> 00:50:59,425
Yeah. Royal blue, yeah.

839
00:51:01,739 --> 00:51:05,732
§ I was feeling insecure §

841
00:51:14,618 --> 00:51:18,611
§ Love me anymore §

842
00:51:18,989 --> 00:51:20,991
Bud's voice:
Well, the point is,

843
00:51:20,991 --> 00:51:24,595
if I can't uh...

844
00:51:24,595 --> 00:51:28,588
function alone,

845
00:51:28,899 --> 00:51:31,735
but I'm scared to death
to love,

846
00:51:31,735 --> 00:51:33,837
that I'm in a real...

847
00:51:33,837 --> 00:51:37,674
predicament.

848
00:51:37,674 --> 00:51:40,911
And it's real deep too.

849
00:51:40,911 --> 00:51:44,904
Because I'm not a kid anymore.

850
00:51:44,948 --> 00:51:48,485
And I'm not broke anymore.

851
00:51:48,485 --> 00:51:52,478
Why didn't you stop me?

852
00:51:57,161 --> 00:52:01,154
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

853
00:52:02,166 --> 00:52:04,435
I don't want to open it.

854
00:52:04,435 --> 00:52:08,428
I may never open it.

855
00:52:09,173 --> 00:52:11,775
Greta, answer me honestly.

856
00:52:11,775 --> 00:52:14,411
have you ever sat down
to have a drink

857
00:52:14,411 --> 00:52:17,714
and it falls down you
like a waterfall of fire?

858
00:52:17,714 --> 00:52:20,617
Like it splits you
down the middle,

859
00:52:20,617 --> 00:52:23,487
like it burns a hole
in your brain

860
00:52:23,487 --> 00:52:27,480
and drains the blood out of your heart
and onto the floor.

861
00:52:31,595 --> 00:52:33,931
What do I like?

862
00:52:33,931 --> 00:52:37,134
You want a list?

863
00:52:37,134 --> 00:52:39,937
Okay, okay.

864
00:52:39,937 --> 00:52:43,540
I like booze.

865
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:47,478
I like you.

866
00:52:47,478 --> 00:52:49,213
I like...

867
00:52:49,213 --> 00:52:53,206
little girls older than four
and younger than six.

868
00:52:53,484 --> 00:52:57,254
Little girls like that,
they should open presents.

869
00:52:57,254 --> 00:53:01,258
I'm a grown man
for Christ's sake.

870
00:53:01,258 --> 00:53:05,251
I've uh...
come up with something.

871
00:53:05,996 --> 00:53:08,198
And uh...

872
00:53:08,198 --> 00:53:11,068
well,

873
00:53:11,068 --> 00:53:12,669
I think...

874
00:53:12,669 --> 00:53:16,106
I just need...

875
00:53:16,106 --> 00:53:20,099
unconditional love.

876
00:53:21,912 --> 00:53:25,905
Are you there?

877
00:53:27,618 --> 00:53:29,219
Oh.

878
00:53:29,219 --> 00:53:31,655
Well, what do you think?

879
00:53:31,655 --> 00:53:35,648
About that.

880
00:53:37,794 --> 00:53:40,731
I was in the elevator
on the way up here,

881
00:53:40,731 --> 00:53:44,724
and there was a little girl
with her mother in there with her.

882
00:53:45,602 --> 00:53:49,006
The little girl had
these huge brown eyes,

883
00:53:49,006 --> 00:53:51,174
curls all over her head,

884
00:53:51,174 --> 00:53:54,678
and she beamed at me
and then hugged my leg.

885
00:53:54,678 --> 00:53:57,814
I just looked at her, you know,

886
00:53:57,814 --> 00:54:00,150
and smiled, grinned really.

887
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:02,986
No teeth.

888
00:54:02,986 --> 00:54:05,055
Teeth scare kids I think.

889
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:09,048
§ I was tryin' §

890
00:54:12,296 --> 00:54:16,289
§ To catch your eye §

891
00:54:19,136 --> 00:54:21,572
§ Thought §

892
00:54:21,572 --> 00:54:25,565
§ That you were tryin' to hide §

893
00:54:27,177 --> 00:54:31,170
And it was so strange,
as I got out,

894
00:54:31,248 --> 00:54:33,216
her mother said,

895
00:54:33,216 --> 00:54:36,219
"She's gonna fall in love
with men who look like you

896
00:54:36,219 --> 00:54:38,121
and not know why.

897
00:54:38,121 --> 00:54:41,358
But I will."

898
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:44,361
And then the elevator door closed.

899
00:54:44,361 --> 00:54:46,229
It was...

900
00:54:46,229 --> 00:54:48,699
oddly...

901
00:54:48,699 --> 00:54:50,067
beautiful.

902
00:54:50,067 --> 00:54:53,637
§ I didn't §

903
00:54:53,637 --> 00:54:57,630
§ Mean to hurt you §

904
00:55:01,578 --> 00:55:05,571
§ I'm sorry §

905
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:11,243

909
00:55:32,275 --> 00:55:35,746
§ A jealous guy. §

910
00:55:35,746 --> 00:55:38,115
Bud's voice:
And I've had a couple of drinks

911
00:55:38,115 --> 00:55:41,385
so it's all dreamy, but...

912
00:55:41,385 --> 00:55:44,955
I couldn't help wondering
about you as a little girl

913
00:55:44,955 --> 00:55:48,948
in an elevator
with your mother.

914
00:55:49,693 --> 00:55:53,686
I wonder...

915
00:55:54,064 --> 00:55:56,833
I wonder if you ever
saw a man

916
00:55:56,833 --> 00:56:00,826
like me.

917
00:56:04,007 --> 00:56:07,811
I'm tired, baby.

918
00:56:07,811 --> 00:56:11,804
Goodnight.

919
00:56:23,794 --> 00:56:27,787
What do you know
about human frailty?

920
00:56:27,964 --> 00:56:31,957
Enough, Buster!

921
00:56:34,871 --> 00:56:38,275
- What's that?
- A wall.

922
00:56:38,275 --> 00:56:39,976
A beer wall.

923
00:56:39,976 --> 00:56:41,745
Girl: It's nice.

924
00:56:41,745 --> 00:56:44,881
I know.

925
00:56:44,881 --> 00:56:47,718
So what do you do?

926
00:56:47,718 --> 00:56:49,753
Are you a gambler
like your friend?

927
00:56:49,753 --> 00:56:53,457
No. He's not a gambler either.

928
00:56:53,457 --> 00:56:56,126
I want to be a Pinkerton.

929
00:56:56,126 --> 00:56:58,829
Is that what your dad does?

930
00:56:58,829 --> 00:57:02,822
No. He's a professional.

931
00:57:02,966 --> 00:57:06,036
Both: Professional what?

932
00:57:06,036 --> 00:57:10,029
A professional, is all.

933
00:57:11,808 --> 00:57:15,801
Why do you want to be a spy?

934
00:57:19,149 --> 00:57:23,086
I want to be
a private detective.

935
00:57:23,086 --> 00:57:25,188
Wall: I'm going to be
very mysterious.

936
00:57:25,188 --> 00:57:27,224
And invincible.

937
00:57:27,224 --> 00:57:29,826
And nobody
will know who I am.

938
00:57:29,826 --> 00:57:31,528
I've got a code name

939
00:57:31,528 --> 00:57:33,530
and I'm going to get cards.

940
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:36,133
They're going
to ask for "Wallman."

941
00:57:36,133 --> 00:57:37,834
That's me,

942
00:57:37,834 --> 00:57:40,170
'cause well,

943
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:42,873
I'll just melt into walls.

944
00:57:42,873 --> 00:57:46,276
Like a human wall.

945
00:57:46,276 --> 00:57:48,111
A human bug,

946
00:57:48,111 --> 00:57:52,015
a human tape recorder,
a human tap on phones.

947
00:57:52,015 --> 00:57:54,151
Everybody is going to love me.

948
00:57:54,151 --> 00:57:57,287
I've got to learn
how to go days without sleeping.

949
00:57:57,287 --> 00:57:59,523
Can't eat neither.

950
00:57:59,523 --> 00:58:03,516
Wallman's got to be real skinny.
My business cards will say,

951
00:58:04,961 --> 00:58:07,497
"For the Wallman...

952
00:58:07,497 --> 00:58:11,490
I'll find you."

953
00:58:13,436 --> 00:58:17,429
Jesus.

954
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:21,878
Audrey's voice:
I want to be a lost poem

955
00:58:21,878 --> 00:58:23,847
in a stranger's coat pocket,

956
00:58:23,847 --> 00:58:24,981
(shower running)

957
00:58:24,981 --> 00:58:28,518
that conveys the importance of you.

958
00:58:28,518 --> 00:58:32,255
To assure you of my desire,

959
00:58:32,255 --> 00:58:36,248
to assure you of dreams.

960
00:58:37,427 --> 00:58:41,420
I want all the possibilities
of you in writing.

961
00:58:42,065 --> 00:58:46,058
I want to give you
your reflection,

962
00:58:46,269 --> 00:58:48,271
Both:
I want your eyes on me,

963
00:58:48,271 --> 00:58:51,474
I want to travel to the lightness
with you and stay there,

964
00:58:51,474 --> 00:58:52,943
and I want
everything before you...

965
00:58:52,943 --> 00:58:56,936
...everything before you
to follow us like a trail behind me.

966
00:58:57,881 --> 00:59:00,417
I want never
to say goodbye to you,

967
00:59:00,417 --> 00:59:04,410
even on the street corner
or the phone.

968
00:59:04,988 --> 00:59:07,924
I want,

969
00:59:07,924 --> 00:59:11,917
I want so much
I'm breathless.

970
00:59:12,162 --> 00:59:15,398
I want to put my power
into a poem to burn a hole

971
00:59:15,398 --> 00:59:17,400
in your pocket

972
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:20,937
so I can sew it.

973
00:59:20,937 --> 00:59:23,406
Val: I want my words
to scream through you

974
00:59:23,406 --> 00:59:26,076
Audrey: I want the poem
not to mean that much.

975
00:59:26,076 --> 00:59:28,912
Both: And I want
to contradict myself by accident,

976
00:59:28,912 --> 00:59:31,248
Audrey: and for you
to know what I mean.

977
00:59:31,248 --> 00:59:35,241
I want you to be distant
and for me to feel you close,

978
00:59:36,419 --> 00:59:39,556
I want endless days
when it's day and...

979
00:59:39,556 --> 00:59:43,549
nighttime never to end
when it's night.

980
00:59:43,627 --> 00:59:46,429
I want all the seasons
in one day.

981
00:59:46,429 --> 00:59:50,422
I want the sun to set before us
and come up in front of us.

982
00:59:51,067 --> 00:59:54,271
I want water up to our waists
and to be drenched by the rain,

983
00:59:54,271 --> 00:59:56,439
up to our ankles
with holes in our shoes.

984
00:59:56,439 --> 00:59:58,275
...with holes in our shoes.

985
00:59:58,275 --> 01:00:02,268
Both: I want to think your thoughts
because they're mine.

986
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:06,616
I want only
what's urgent with you.

987
01:00:06,616 --> 01:00:09,452
I want to get
in the way of the barriers

988
01:00:09,452 --> 01:00:12,122
and I want you to be a tough guy
when you're supposed to,

989
01:00:12,122 --> 01:00:14,291
like you do already.

990
01:00:14,291 --> 01:00:16,259
...when you're supposed to.

991
01:00:16,259 --> 01:00:20,252
And I want you to be tender,
like you do already.

992
01:00:20,997 --> 01:00:23,266
And I want us
to have met for a reason

993
01:00:23,266 --> 01:00:26,336
and I want that reason
to be important.

994
01:00:26,336 --> 01:00:29,306
And I want it
to be bigger than us,

995
01:00:29,306 --> 01:00:31,641
I want it to take over us.

996
01:00:31,641 --> 01:00:34,511
I want to forget.

997
01:00:34,511 --> 01:00:37,681
I want to remember us.

998
01:00:37,681 --> 01:00:39,683
And when you say
you love me

999
01:00:39,683 --> 01:00:42,352
I don't want to think
you really mean New York City,

1000
01:00:42,352 --> 01:00:45,922
and all the fun
we have in it.

1001
01:00:45,922 --> 01:00:48,425
And I want your smile always,

1002
01:00:48,425 --> 01:00:52,418
and your grimaces too.

1003
01:00:53,029 --> 01:00:56,700
I want your scar on my lips,

1004
01:00:56,700 --> 01:01:00,693
and I want your disappointments
in my heart.

1005
01:01:01,304 --> 01:01:03,206
I want your strength
in my soul

1006
01:01:03,206 --> 01:01:05,141
and I want
your soul in my eyes,

1007
01:01:05,141 --> 01:01:08,178
I want to believe
everything you say,

1008
01:01:08,178 --> 01:01:11,047
and I do.

1009
01:01:11,047 --> 01:01:13,316
And I want you
to tell me what's best

1010
01:01:13,316 --> 01:01:15,452
when I don't know.

1011
01:01:15,452 --> 01:01:19,445
And when you're lost
I want to find you.

1012
01:01:19,556 --> 01:01:21,958
And when you're weary

1013
01:01:21,958 --> 01:01:24,728
I want to give you steeples

1014
01:01:24,728 --> 01:01:27,397
and cathedral thoughts

1015
01:01:27,397 --> 01:01:31,067
and coliseum dreams.

1016
01:01:31,067 --> 01:01:33,737
I want to drag you from the darkness

1017
01:01:33,737 --> 01:01:36,373
and kneel with you

1018
01:01:36,373 --> 01:01:40,366
exhausted with the blinding light
blaring on us,

1019
01:01:40,543 --> 01:01:44,536
And...

1020
01:01:44,681 --> 01:01:48,218
Ross: So...

1021
01:01:48,218 --> 01:01:52,211
I met Terry's brother first
at treatment.

1022
01:01:52,589 --> 01:01:54,524
And then I went
to a halfway house

1023
01:01:54,524 --> 01:01:57,227
and I ended up
in a storefront downtown.

1024
01:01:57,227 --> 01:01:59,596
So Terry comes in,

1025
01:01:59,596 --> 01:02:03,589
I don't even know
how Terry knew I was there,

1026
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,469
I didn't even know Terry.

1027
01:02:06,469 --> 01:02:10,462
But everybody knew Terry Olsen,

1028
01:02:11,207 --> 01:02:12,675
Girl: Hmm...

1029
01:02:12,675 --> 01:02:16,668
- Really?
- He, uh...

1030
01:02:17,047 --> 01:02:18,581
(girl chuckles)

1031
01:02:18,581 --> 01:02:21,017
So...

1032
01:02:21,017 --> 01:02:23,820
- Terry came in to my place,
- Uh-huh?

1033
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:26,156
and he says,

1034
01:02:26,156 --> 01:02:29,259
"Hey..."

1035
01:02:29,259 --> 01:02:31,061
No. He said,

1036
01:02:31,061 --> 01:02:34,030
"Get your shit... get your shit together.

1037
01:02:34,030 --> 01:02:38,023
Why are you... why are you
wasting your life away?"

1038
01:02:40,503 --> 01:02:42,072
And you know what?

1039
01:02:42,072 --> 01:02:46,065
(water dripping)

1040
01:02:47,077 --> 01:02:51,070
He was right.

1041
01:02:53,049 --> 01:02:57,042
Hmm...

1042
01:02:59,422 --> 01:03:02,058
§ One, two, three, four... §

1043
01:03:02,058 --> 01:03:06,051
(guitar music plays)

1044
01:03:09,466 --> 01:03:13,369
§ They were strolling
in the gloaming §

1045
01:03:13,369 --> 01:03:17,362
- § Where the roses were in bloom §
- (knocking on door)

1046
01:03:18,775 --> 01:03:21,678
- § A soldier and his sweetheart §
- Bud: Grace!

1047
01:03:21,678 --> 01:03:25,671
§ Brave and true... §

1048
01:03:26,716 --> 01:03:28,718
Oh, man!

1049
01:03:28,718 --> 01:03:31,821
Wait a second!

1050
01:03:31,821 --> 01:03:33,256
Uh...

1051
01:03:33,256 --> 01:03:37,249
Hey, it's late.

1052
01:03:37,894 --> 01:03:39,762
Grace:
What's the matter?!

1053
01:03:39,762 --> 01:03:41,531
(door closes)

1054
01:03:41,531 --> 01:03:44,300
Bud: I'm very, very,
very, very, very...

1055
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:47,570
very, very,
very, very drunk.

1056
01:03:47,570 --> 01:03:50,673
May I come in?

1057
01:03:50,673 --> 01:03:52,542
Grace: What's this?

1058
01:03:52,542 --> 01:03:54,577
I stole it for you.

1059
01:03:54,577 --> 01:03:56,112
Grace: You stole it?

1060
01:03:56,112 --> 01:03:57,380
Uh-huh.

1061
01:03:57,380 --> 01:04:01,373
It's not as
old-fashioned as flowers.

1062
01:04:01,518 --> 01:04:03,653
- (groaning)
- Can I come in?

1063
01:04:03,653 --> 01:04:07,157
Actually I was just about
to go to bed, so...

1064
01:04:07,157 --> 01:04:09,125
Just for a second.

1065
01:04:09,125 --> 01:04:10,894
Can I get you something?

1066
01:04:10,894 --> 01:04:14,887
- May I use the...
- Sure.

1067
01:04:15,932 --> 01:04:19,925
(door closes)

1068
01:04:20,770 --> 01:04:22,839
Bud: Grace?

1069
01:04:22,839 --> 01:04:24,641
Yes?

1070
01:04:24,641 --> 01:04:28,344
You must promise me something.

1071
01:04:28,344 --> 01:04:31,247
- Okay.
- Don't be scared of me.

1072
01:04:31,247 --> 01:04:34,217
I'm not a scary drunk.

1073
01:04:34,217 --> 01:04:36,653
I'm not even a mean drunk.

1074
01:04:36,653 --> 01:04:39,889
(toilet flushing)
Actually, they say it's a sickness,

1075
01:04:39,889 --> 01:04:42,158
so it's...

1076
01:04:42,158 --> 01:04:46,151
not even my fault.

1077
01:04:46,829 --> 01:04:49,332
- Just friends.
- Sure.

1078
01:04:49,332 --> 01:04:50,833
What?

1079
01:04:50,833 --> 01:04:53,203
"Just friends," that song.

1080
01:04:53,203 --> 01:04:54,704
Chet Baker.

1081
01:04:54,704 --> 01:04:58,697
Yeah?

1082
01:04:58,841 --> 01:05:02,834
I heard you play that song.

1083
01:05:02,946 --> 01:05:05,848
Are you all right?

1084
01:05:05,848 --> 01:05:08,785
Yeah, I came over because

1085
01:05:08,785 --> 01:05:12,288
I have no friends
and I need a friend and...

1086
01:05:12,288 --> 01:05:16,281
you like that song...
you told me.

1087
01:05:18,361 --> 01:05:22,354
Maybe you should just go home
and get some sleep, though.

1088
01:05:22,465 --> 01:05:25,435
I'm sure you'll feel much better
in the morning.

1089
01:05:25,435 --> 01:05:27,704
Do you have any aspirin?

1090
01:05:27,704 --> 01:05:31,541
Aspirin? Uhm...

1091
01:05:31,541 --> 01:05:33,276
I don't think I do.

1092
01:05:33,276 --> 01:05:35,712
I hate going to bed drunk.

1093
01:05:35,712 --> 01:05:38,348
I get scared I won't wake up.

1094
01:05:38,348 --> 01:05:41,317
Maybe you should go
and get some coffee then.

1095
01:05:41,317 --> 01:05:45,310
Coffee is a fallacy.

1096
01:05:45,421 --> 01:05:48,591
It makes you sober because
that's what you've been told,

1097
01:05:48,591 --> 01:05:51,394
it's psychological.

1098
01:05:51,394 --> 01:05:53,563
The only way to get sober

1099
01:05:53,563 --> 01:05:57,267
is to sweat it out,
stay up.

1100
01:05:57,267 --> 01:05:58,534
Well, uh...

1101
01:05:58,534 --> 01:06:02,527
I'd love to sweat it out
with you, but...

1102
01:06:02,772 --> 01:06:06,776
I really, really
got to get some sleep.

1103
01:06:06,776 --> 01:06:08,611
Sing to me.

1104
01:06:08,611 --> 01:06:12,604
Sing to you?

1105
01:06:13,783 --> 01:06:17,587
I'm...
I'm just not a singer.

1106
01:06:17,587 --> 01:06:21,524
What's it going to take, Grace?

1107
01:06:21,524 --> 01:06:22,892
What do you mean?

1108
01:06:22,892 --> 01:06:24,594
I mean...

1109
01:06:24,594 --> 01:06:28,587
who do you want me to be?

1110
01:06:28,731 --> 01:06:32,502
Oh, I think you're fine, Bud.

1111
01:06:32,502 --> 01:06:34,704
You're just a little drunk.

1112
01:06:34,704 --> 01:06:38,374
(Bud chuckles)

1113
01:06:38,374 --> 01:06:41,377
Let me ask you something.

1114
01:06:41,377 --> 01:06:43,446
Have you ever been drunk?

1115
01:06:43,446 --> 01:06:45,815
Me?

1116
01:06:45,815 --> 01:06:49,652
Of course.

1117
01:06:49,652 --> 01:06:53,645
Have you ever been drunk?

1118
01:06:54,390 --> 01:06:58,383
Honey, you just asked me that.

1119
01:06:58,761 --> 01:07:02,754
I mean,
have you ever been in love?

1120
01:07:05,902 --> 01:07:09,605
It's none of your business.

1121
01:07:09,605 --> 01:07:12,642
Of course I have.

1122
01:07:12,642 --> 01:07:16,635
Well,
let me tell you something.

1123
01:07:16,979 --> 01:07:20,972
I know exactly
what I'm saying,

1124
01:07:21,584 --> 01:07:25,577
and I know exactly
what I'm doing.

1125
01:07:25,722 --> 01:07:29,715
And I've seen
people come and go.

1126
01:07:30,693 --> 01:07:33,563
And I just want...

1127
01:07:33,563 --> 01:07:36,632
I want...

1128
01:07:36,632 --> 01:07:40,603
I don't know
what to say to you, Bud.

1129
01:07:40,603 --> 01:07:44,596
Don't say anything.

1130
01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:50,413
(telephone rings)

1131
01:07:50,413 --> 01:07:53,783
Oh my God!

1132
01:07:53,783 --> 01:07:56,519
(ringing)

1133
01:07:56,519 --> 01:07:59,122
Uhm...

1134
01:07:59,122 --> 01:08:01,491
(ringing)

1135
01:08:01,491 --> 01:08:04,427
- Hello?
- Man: Grace, are you there?

1136
01:08:04,427 --> 01:08:06,763
I'm calling you from the plane,
are you there?

1137
01:08:06,763 --> 01:08:09,132
I can't hear you!
Can you hear me?

1138
01:08:09,132 --> 01:08:11,601
- Hello?!
- Grace: Yes, I can hear you.

1139
01:08:11,601 --> 01:08:14,771
Man: Great! If we get cut off
I'll call you right back.

1140
01:08:14,771 --> 01:08:17,140
All right?
So just sit by the phone.

1141
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:20,443
- All right? Okay?
- Grace: Okay.

1142
01:08:20,443 --> 01:08:24,436
Man: Jesus, Grace! I called
to talk to you. Say something!

1143
01:08:24,747 --> 01:08:26,382
You talk.

1144
01:08:26,382 --> 01:08:29,185
Listen to this. They want me
to do The Tonight Show, right?

1145
01:08:29,185 --> 01:08:33,055
I told them, I get tired
going back to fucking New York,

1146
01:08:33,055 --> 01:08:36,793
and if you want me to do this
then you find a goddamn way!

1147
01:08:36,793 --> 01:08:39,095
- Grace? Can you fucking hear me?
- Grace: Yeah.

1148
01:08:39,095 --> 01:08:40,763
Man: Did you hear
what I've just said?

1149
01:08:40,763 --> 01:08:42,598
Grace: Yeah.

1150
01:08:42,598 --> 01:08:45,401
Man:
What do you think?!

1151
01:08:45,401 --> 01:08:47,170
I think it's great.

1152
01:08:47,170 --> 01:08:49,472
Man: Yeah, all right.
You talk for a while, okay?

1153
01:08:49,472 --> 01:08:52,775
And speak up
for Christ sakes!

1154
01:08:52,775 --> 01:08:56,412
- Hello?!
- Grace: Well,

1155
01:08:56,412 --> 01:08:58,848
you probably think
you're going to hate this but...

1156
01:08:58,848 --> 01:09:00,483
Man: All right, yeah, what?

1157
01:09:00,483 --> 01:09:03,486
I went walking through
the Farmer's Market today

1158
01:09:03,486 --> 01:09:04,654
and uh...

1159
01:09:04,654 --> 01:09:07,824
and I heard this saxophone,
out of nowhere, like an angel.

1160
01:09:07,824 --> 01:09:10,660
It was "Willow Weep For Me,"
by Ben Webster,

1161
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:14,653
it was extraordinary, and...

1162
01:09:14,831 --> 01:09:16,766
Sam?

1163
01:09:16,766 --> 01:09:17,934
Sam?

1164
01:09:17,934 --> 01:09:21,927
(dial tone)

1165
01:09:25,208 --> 01:09:27,443
(phone rings)

1166
01:09:27,443 --> 01:09:30,446
Hello?

1167
01:09:30,446 --> 01:09:33,716
Collect call from who?

1168
01:09:33,716 --> 01:09:35,251
Oh yes.

1169
01:09:35,251 --> 01:09:36,819
Val?

1170
01:09:36,819 --> 01:09:40,756
Val, are you there?

1171
01:09:40,756 --> 01:09:44,749
Are you okay?

1172
01:09:48,197 --> 01:09:52,190
He punched you?
Are you okay?

1173
01:09:57,807 --> 01:10:01,800
When are you coming back?

1174
01:10:02,912 --> 01:10:06,905
I miss you too.

1175
01:10:08,651 --> 01:10:10,920
Oh, I just remembered...

1176
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:12,989
Oh, I'm sweating,

1177
01:10:12,989 --> 01:10:16,982
I had this awful dream...

1178
01:10:17,527 --> 01:10:20,763
that these Vietnam soldiers...

1179
01:10:20,763 --> 01:10:24,756
Yeah, they're Vietnamese,
they broke into my room...

1180
01:10:24,934 --> 01:10:28,927
Yeah,
through the french windows...

1181
01:10:29,105 --> 01:10:33,098
Yeah, they had machine guns...

1182
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:38,603
It sounds silly but it wasn't
silly in my dream, it was scary.

1183
01:10:41,284 --> 01:10:43,953
I'm lonely and scared?

1184
01:10:43,953 --> 01:10:47,946
How do you know?

1185
01:10:48,658 --> 01:10:52,128
Val?

1186
01:10:52,128 --> 01:10:56,121
Val?

1187
01:11:07,310 --> 01:11:09,245
(phone rings)

1188
01:11:09,245 --> 01:11:11,948
- Sam?
- Yeah, it's Sam.

1189
01:11:11,948 --> 01:11:15,651
Of course it's me.
Who else is it going to be?

1190
01:11:15,651 --> 01:11:17,553
So what happened?

1191
01:11:17,553 --> 01:11:21,546
- What happened?
- Sam: Yeah, the Ben Webster story?

1192
01:11:22,058 --> 01:11:24,093
I was reading the liner notes,

1193
01:11:24,093 --> 01:11:26,028
and you know they used
to call him "The Frog"?

1194
01:11:26,028 --> 01:11:29,198
And sometimes "The Brute."

1195
01:11:29,198 --> 01:11:31,033
Sam: Uh-huh?

1196
01:11:31,033 --> 01:11:32,234
Yeah.

1197
01:11:32,234 --> 01:11:35,905
Sam: So?

1198
01:11:35,905 --> 01:11:39,275
So...

1199
01:11:39,275 --> 01:11:41,644
It's so beautiful, Sam.

1200
01:11:41,644 --> 01:11:43,846
His sound.

1201
01:11:43,846 --> 01:11:46,315
Sam:
Are you asleep?! Or what?

1202
01:11:46,315 --> 01:11:49,385
I mean,
what are you talking about?!

1203
01:11:49,385 --> 01:11:50,987
I told you you'd hate it.

1204
01:11:50,987 --> 01:11:54,056
Oh for Christ's sakes,
I don't hate it.

1205
01:11:54,056 --> 01:11:57,326
Listen, I have been thinking
about you the whole time,

1206
01:11:57,326 --> 01:11:59,028
missing you.

1207
01:11:59,028 --> 01:12:00,730
I miss you too.

1208
01:12:00,730 --> 01:12:03,799
Sam: Do you remember
that DP on the movie,

1209
01:12:03,799 --> 01:12:06,102
the one that I told you about?

1210
01:12:06,102 --> 01:12:09,138
Right. I told him that you
were a writer and he went on,

1211
01:12:09,138 --> 01:12:11,841
telling me this story
about a student

1212
01:12:11,841 --> 01:12:14,744
who becomes obsessed with a poet,
a philosopher guy, right?

1213
01:12:14,744 --> 01:12:17,880
And he reads everything the poet
writes and taught himself French

1214
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:20,950
so he could read the original poems
in their original form,

1215
01:12:20,950 --> 01:12:24,020
and he quits college and spends
all his money just to go to France

1216
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:25,921
and find this poet.

1217
01:12:25,921 --> 01:12:28,924
And he gets there, and not only
does he meet the guy,

1218
01:12:28,924 --> 01:12:31,894
but he gets himself invited
to the old guy's house.

1219
01:12:31,894 --> 01:12:33,896
And, I mean, it is beautiful!

1220
01:12:33,896 --> 01:12:37,433
The sun is shining
through the windows,

1221
01:12:37,433 --> 01:12:40,436
he couldn't have dreamt
for a more perfect situation.

1222
01:12:40,436 --> 01:12:43,739
They sat down to lunch, he asked him
some questions he had prepared...

1223
01:12:43,739 --> 01:12:47,309
And the poet starts to answer,
and the student realizes

1224
01:12:47,309 --> 01:12:50,046
that he's forgotten
his tape recorder,

1225
01:12:50,046 --> 01:12:52,882
and since he's
self-educated from a book,

1226
01:12:52,882 --> 01:12:55,051
he doesn't understand a word
the guy says.

1227
01:12:55,051 --> 01:12:58,954
But the poet talks on and on
all afternoon enthusiastically,

1228
01:12:58,954 --> 01:13:02,291
with this great
knowing light in his eyes,

1229
01:13:02,291 --> 01:13:04,794
and the student just sits
opposite this guy,

1230
01:13:04,794 --> 01:13:07,830
not understanding
a word he says.

1231
01:13:07,830 --> 01:13:10,366
Too humble
or shy or whatever,

1232
01:13:10,366 --> 01:13:13,169
to assert himself,
and then he nodded his head,

1233
01:13:13,169 --> 01:13:16,172
thanked the poet and got back
on the plane, penniless.

1234
01:13:16,172 --> 01:13:17,840
But he did learn.

1235
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:20,342
- Yeah.
- Sam: He learned...

1236
01:13:20,342 --> 01:13:23,145
that there are no answers.

1237
01:13:23,145 --> 01:13:24,880
I'm not a writer.

1238
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:26,382
Sam: What?!

1239
01:13:26,382 --> 01:13:29,218
What?! What are you talking about?

1240
01:13:29,218 --> 01:13:31,353
Sounds wonderful.

1241
01:13:31,353 --> 01:13:33,889
Sam: Bullshit,
I didn't tell it any good,

1242
01:13:33,889 --> 01:13:35,691
you should've heard Jean Paul.

1243
01:13:35,691 --> 01:13:39,061
Listen, Grace,
I'm landing in 45 minutes,

1244
01:13:39,061 --> 01:13:41,831
- You want to pick me up?
- It's 5:00 in the morning.

1245
01:13:41,831 --> 01:13:44,200
Yeah, I know. Come on.

1246
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:45,735
Grace: I don't...

1247
01:13:45,735 --> 01:13:48,437
What? You don't want to?

1248
01:13:48,437 --> 01:13:50,206
No, I mean...

1249
01:13:50,206 --> 01:13:52,308
- Sam: What?!
- I don't have $30 on me.

1250
01:13:52,308 --> 01:13:54,744
Sam: Oh bullshit!
That's an excuse!

1251
01:13:54,744 --> 01:13:56,512
It's not an excuse...

1252
01:13:56,512 --> 01:13:59,215
Sam: This is not about me.
You use money

1253
01:13:59,215 --> 01:14:01,751
and the lack of it
as an excuse.

1254
01:14:01,751 --> 01:14:04,820
Okay? I need you.
I feel like fucking shit!

1255
01:14:04,820 --> 01:14:07,323
My movie is horrible,
nobody likes it,

1256
01:14:07,323 --> 01:14:10,025
I'm exhausted, I feel sick,
I want to see you

1257
01:14:10,025 --> 01:14:13,229
- And you won't fucking do it!
- Oh my God, Sam.

1258
01:14:13,229 --> 01:14:14,897
Sam: What?!

1259
01:14:14,897 --> 01:14:17,366
I want to be there
but I just can't.

1260
01:14:17,366 --> 01:14:19,235
Sam: No, but you won't!
All right?

1261
01:14:19,235 --> 01:14:21,237
All right, fuck it, all right?

1262
01:14:21,237 --> 01:14:23,005
Fuck it! Fuck you!

1263
01:14:23,005 --> 01:14:26,998
(dial tone)

1264
01:14:32,414 --> 01:14:34,416
(hangs up)

1265
01:14:34,416 --> 01:14:38,409
(Grace sighs)

1266
01:14:43,292 --> 01:14:47,285
there's three of us.

1267
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:53,302
That's my brother's.

1268
01:14:53,302 --> 01:14:54,970
Brian's.

1269
01:14:54,970 --> 01:14:57,339
Oh yeah?

1270
01:14:57,339 --> 01:14:59,308
Yeah.

1271
01:14:59,308 --> 01:15:01,477
Oh.

1272
01:15:01,477 --> 01:15:05,470
Yeah, he's got a gun.

1273
01:15:06,515 --> 01:15:09,351
So, is this your brother's place?

1274
01:15:09,351 --> 01:15:11,387
No.

1275
01:15:11,387 --> 01:15:14,323
It's nice.

1276
01:15:14,323 --> 01:15:16,258
Yeah.

1277
01:15:16,258 --> 01:15:20,251
And then there's Michael.

1278
01:15:20,496 --> 01:15:23,833
Michael is a Jesuit.

1279
01:15:23,833 --> 01:15:25,501
A what?

1280
01:15:25,501 --> 01:15:27,336
A priest.

1281
01:15:27,336 --> 01:15:31,106
He lives in Italy.

1282
01:15:31,106 --> 01:15:34,076
He was a green beret
in Vietnam.

1283
01:15:34,076 --> 01:15:37,179
He got the purple heart.

1284
01:15:37,179 --> 01:15:40,449
He's God.

1285
01:15:40,449 --> 01:15:44,442
I wish I could meet him.

1286
01:15:45,454 --> 01:15:48,958
Yeah.

1287
01:15:48,958 --> 01:15:52,951
He lives in Italy.
At the Vatican.

1288
01:15:53,095 --> 01:15:55,064
Girl: The what?

1289
01:15:55,064 --> 01:15:57,199
Where the Pope is.

1290
01:15:57,199 --> 01:15:59,034
Oh.

1291
01:15:59,034 --> 01:16:01,136
And then there's Tom.

1292
01:16:01,136 --> 01:16:05,129
Tom's the youngest.

1293
01:16:05,307 --> 01:16:09,300
I did that to Tom.

1294
01:16:17,186 --> 01:16:20,522
I beat the shit
out of that kid.

1295
01:16:20,522 --> 01:16:24,515
When he was this big.

1296
01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:26,896
Why?

1297
01:16:26,896 --> 01:16:30,889
We all did.

1298
01:16:34,103 --> 01:16:36,338
So...

1299
01:16:36,338 --> 01:16:38,674
when he was caught...

1300
01:16:38,674 --> 01:16:42,667
Girl: Caught?

1301
01:16:43,579 --> 01:16:45,948
Someone told me once,

1302
01:16:45,948 --> 01:16:49,685
one of the detectives,

1303
01:16:49,685 --> 01:16:53,678
that some people
are born bad.

1304
01:16:55,424 --> 01:16:58,527
Terry:
What do you think?

1305
01:16:58,527 --> 01:17:01,697
I don't know.

1306
01:17:01,697 --> 01:17:05,534
Terry:
He's just about your age.

1307
01:17:05,534 --> 01:17:07,903
He wasn't born bad.

1308
01:17:07,903 --> 01:17:11,896
And he was beautiful.

1309
01:17:13,642 --> 01:17:17,635
When he smiled...

1310
01:17:18,580 --> 01:17:22,573
he just broke my heart.

1311
01:17:23,552 --> 01:17:27,545
He hardly ever did it.

1312
01:17:28,023 --> 01:17:32,016
It's the fucking streets.

1313
01:17:46,342 --> 01:17:48,944
You have to go to school tomorrow,
don't you?

1314
01:17:48,944 --> 01:17:50,179
Yeah.

1315
01:17:50,179 --> 01:17:51,613
High school?

1316
01:17:51,613 --> 01:17:55,150
Yeah.

1317
01:17:55,150 --> 01:17:57,519
Wow!

1318
01:17:57,519 --> 01:18:01,512
What?

1319
01:18:06,662 --> 01:18:10,632
You can put your clothes on.

1320
01:18:10,632 --> 01:18:14,625
I'm gonna take you home.

1321
01:18:25,481 --> 01:18:28,083
(telephone rings)

1322
01:18:28,083 --> 01:18:31,220
Sam: I don't understand why
you won't meet me at the airport.

1323
01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:33,522
Things are just starting
to go good with us,

1324
01:18:33,522 --> 01:18:35,724
and I think
you're fucking it up, okay?

1325
01:18:35,724 --> 01:18:39,161
- Grace, you're just...
- I'm just what, Sam?

1326
01:18:39,161 --> 01:18:41,430
Sam: You... you just don't care
about anything.

1327
01:18:41,430 --> 01:18:45,423
All right?
Not me, not yourself, not us.

1328
01:18:46,035 --> 01:18:48,504
You just don't care.

1329
01:18:48,504 --> 01:18:50,005
Hello?

1330
01:18:50,005 --> 01:18:51,540
I do care.

1331
01:18:51,540 --> 01:18:53,208
Sam: Well, listen, you know...

1332
01:18:53,208 --> 01:18:54,676
Goodnight, Sam.

1333
01:18:54,676 --> 01:18:58,347
Sam: Hold on a second.
I'll be getting in around...

1334
01:18:58,347 --> 01:19:02,340
(hangs up)

1335
01:19:03,619 --> 01:19:06,455
Wall: Hi.

1336
01:19:06,455 --> 01:19:07,689
Hello.

1337
01:19:07,689 --> 01:19:09,324
I'm Wall.

1338
01:19:09,324 --> 01:19:12,694
Grace: Hello, Wall.

1339
01:19:12,694 --> 01:19:16,687
Can you sleep over?

1340
01:19:17,299 --> 01:19:18,333
Hmm...

1341
01:19:18,333 --> 01:19:21,804
no, I don't think
I can sleep over, but...

1342
01:19:21,804 --> 01:19:25,574
I can come over sometime.
Sure.

1343
01:19:25,574 --> 01:19:28,644
I can take you over to
my friend Diane's house 'cause...

1344
01:19:28,644 --> 01:19:31,547
she has an aquarium and...

1345
01:19:31,547 --> 01:19:34,817
after that I was thinking

1346
01:19:34,817 --> 01:19:38,654
you could come over to my house
and read some Langston Hughes.

1347
01:19:38,654 --> 01:19:40,055
Some what?

1348
01:19:40,055 --> 01:19:42,091
Wall: Langston Hughes.

1349
01:19:42,091 --> 01:19:44,827
Where'd you get Langston Hughes?

1350
01:19:44,827 --> 01:19:46,428
My dad.

1351
01:19:46,428 --> 01:19:50,421
Oh. Is your dad a poet?

1352
01:19:52,134 --> 01:19:54,303
No. I don't know.

1353
01:19:54,303 --> 01:19:56,805
It's hard to say
who's really a poet.

1354
01:19:56,805 --> 01:19:59,675
You know?

1355
01:19:59,675 --> 01:20:03,668
Wall: I've got to go now.
The sun's coming up.

1356
01:20:14,256 --> 01:20:18,249
(door opens loudly)

1357
01:20:37,312 --> 01:20:41,305
(door bangs open)

1358
01:20:47,156 --> 01:20:50,826
(typewriter tapping)

1359
01:20:50,826 --> 01:20:53,562
Bud's voice: his grandfather
discovered gold...

1360
01:20:53,562 --> 01:20:56,832
..."Daddo?" Billy puts his hat back
to see his father.

1361
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:59,935
He's here just to consider him
more of an institution...

1362
01:20:59,935 --> 01:21:02,237
...he's always still, like that.

1363
01:21:02,237 --> 01:21:06,230
I took a chance. I said, "I told her
that I had an unresolved pain,

1364
01:21:06,642 --> 01:21:09,478
that no one had
ever loved me enough."

1365
01:21:09,478 --> 01:21:11,413
I looked at her and said,

1366
01:21:11,413 --> 01:21:12,948
"I'll get better."

1367
01:21:12,948 --> 01:21:15,284
She said, "I hope so, honey."

1368
01:21:15,284 --> 01:21:18,687
It'd be hard not to love a girl
who says that all the time.

1369
01:21:18,687 --> 01:21:21,623
Then she tells me
about the sea,

1370
01:21:21,623 --> 01:21:25,160
she tells me that in the deep sea,
in the black sea,

1371
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:27,563
there's a shaft of light
or moonbeam.

1372
01:21:27,563 --> 01:21:30,933
And the people who see that light
swim for miles.

1373
01:21:30,933 --> 01:21:33,502
...in the deep sea, in the black sea.

1374
01:21:33,502 --> 01:21:36,171
...they can't touch the rapture.
It's like a rainbow.

1375
01:21:36,171 --> 01:21:38,674
It seems like it's in your reach,
but it ain't.

1376
01:21:38,674 --> 01:21:40,909
My grandfather discovered gold
in this country.

1377
01:21:40,909 --> 01:21:42,978
He blazed a trail
that's still there today...

1378
01:21:42,978 --> 01:21:45,547
I ain't trying to have my heritage.
I'm part of something.

1379
01:21:45,547 --> 01:21:47,182
Can't you see!

1380
01:21:47,182 --> 01:21:49,318
He didn't care
about much else...

1381
01:21:49,318 --> 01:21:52,354
I know I'm not the only one left
still thinking about it.

1382
01:21:52,354 --> 01:21:55,457
Why is that a man can stand
in a corn field or in a river...?

1383
01:21:55,457 --> 01:21:57,993
So I took the hair
from her face.

1384
01:21:57,993 --> 01:22:01,986
Why does that same man
look at the one he loves...

1385
01:22:02,197 --> 01:22:05,400
...still live in the deep sea,
in the black sea.

1386
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:07,603
"Where'd she go?" Daddo, asked.

1387
01:22:07,603 --> 01:22:09,438
No one ever
loved you enough, son.

1388
01:22:09,438 --> 01:22:13,431
...this was his land.
He was never in a hurry to get off it.

1399
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:31,286
Well,
I... I tried calling and...

1400
01:23:31,286 --> 01:23:33,955
you know, you're never there
or it's busy...

1401
01:23:33,955 --> 01:23:35,724
- Grace: Yeah.
- I was worried,

1402
01:23:35,724 --> 01:23:38,460
and I just came by
to check up on you.

1403
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:40,629
Grace: Yeah, um...

1404
01:23:40,629 --> 01:23:43,999
I'm... I'm...
I've been working is all.

1405
01:23:43,999 --> 01:23:47,992
But... I'm fine.

1406
01:23:48,470 --> 01:23:50,906
How are you?

1407
01:23:50,906 --> 01:23:54,810
Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine.

1408
01:23:54,810 --> 01:23:57,646
- You're sure?
- Yeah, sure, sure.

1409
01:23:57,646 --> 01:24:00,315
- You seem kind of sad tonight.
- Nah.

1410
01:24:00,315 --> 01:24:04,308
You just want
someone to talk to?

1411
01:24:06,555 --> 01:24:09,091
I was...

1412
01:24:09,091 --> 01:24:11,793
I was just walking by here,

1413
01:24:11,793 --> 01:24:15,786
and I thought of you.
I think about you sometimes when I...

1414
01:24:16,865 --> 01:24:19,534
when I walk by, you know?

1415
01:24:19,534 --> 01:24:23,527
Yeah.

1416
01:24:23,705 --> 01:24:25,073
How are you doing?

1417
01:24:25,073 --> 01:24:29,066
I've been working.

1418
01:24:30,145 --> 01:24:32,781
Well, I hope that
sometime you call me.

1419
01:24:32,781 --> 01:24:35,016
You know, you need something...

1420
01:24:35,016 --> 01:24:39,009
I know, Frank. I know.

1421
01:24:40,989 --> 01:24:42,991
I... I... I'll go.

1422
01:24:42,991 --> 01:24:44,126
I'll go.

1423
01:24:44,126 --> 01:24:48,119
I'm sorry for waking you.
I just wanted to see you're okay.

1424
01:24:49,998 --> 01:24:51,867
- Grace, I...
- I'm okay.

1425
01:24:51,867 --> 01:24:54,035
You know,
I thought that maybe sometime

1426
01:24:54,035 --> 01:24:56,438
we could have a cup of coffee...

1427
01:24:56,438 --> 01:24:58,740
and just talk.

1428
01:24:58,740 --> 01:25:00,976
Yeah. Maybe sometime.

1429
01:25:00,976 --> 01:25:04,969
And talk about life.

1430
01:25:06,448 --> 01:25:10,441
I don't know.

1431
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:13,922
Yeah. Okay.

1432
01:25:13,922 --> 01:25:17,092
Uh...

1433
01:25:17,092 --> 01:25:21,085
Anyway, Grace, I...

1434
01:25:21,763 --> 01:25:25,756
Well...
okay, goodnight.

Grace: Goodnight.

1436
01:25:29,971 --> 01:25:32,007
- Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah.

1437
01:25:32,007 --> 01:25:33,175

ever loved you enough, son.

1443
01:26:03,505 --> 01:26:04,973
(tapping typewriter)

1444
01:26:04,973 --> 01:26:07,876
I'm sorry for that.

1445
01:26:07,876 --> 01:26:11,012
I give everyone
a 100% off the bat.

1446
01:26:11,012 --> 01:26:13,448
It doesn't matter
who it is either.

1447
01:26:13,448 --> 01:26:15,450
I'll give it all.

1448
01:26:15,450 --> 01:26:18,453
Whatever they take away
is their business,

1449
01:26:18,453 --> 01:26:20,722
makes no difference to me.

1450
01:26:20,722 --> 01:26:24,715
Poet: Can you hear the lovesick
wood pigeons mooning in bed?

1451
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:29,498
A dog barks in his sleep.
Farmyards awake.

1452
01:26:29,498 --> 01:26:33,491
A town ripples like a lake
in the waking haze.

1453
01:26:47,082 --> 01:26:50,819
Audrey: Why do you
have to wear a suit?

1454
01:26:50,819 --> 01:26:54,812
I don't know.

1455
01:27:03,798 --> 01:27:06,134
Can I shave you?

1456
01:27:06,134 --> 01:27:10,127
Of course you can.

1457
01:27:48,543 --> 01:27:52,536
...I was just looking
at this picture...

1458
01:27:53,148 --> 01:27:55,817
Well, you know...

1459
01:27:55,817 --> 01:27:59,810
You know
how I feel about you.

1460
01:28:05,060 --> 01:28:07,829
Oh, really?
I didn't... I didn't know...

1461
01:28:07,829 --> 01:28:11,733
if you'd want
to talk to me.

1462
01:28:11,733 --> 01:28:15,604
Man: I don't use
a tape recorder.

1463
01:28:15,604 --> 01:28:18,073
I'll just take notes
if that's okay?

1464
01:28:18,073 --> 01:28:20,675
Woman: Sure, whatever. Yeah.

1465
01:28:20,675 --> 01:28:24,279
Man: So, tell me about him.

1466
01:28:24,279 --> 01:28:28,272
Just what comes to mind...

1467
01:28:28,783 --> 01:28:32,776
What's the insufferable
hunger of the damned?

1468
01:28:33,288 --> 01:28:37,281
Where did you find that?

1469
01:28:39,694 --> 01:28:43,632
In your pants pocket.

1470
01:28:43,632 --> 01:28:45,934
It's a title.

1471
01:28:45,934 --> 01:28:48,203
To what?

1472
01:28:48,203 --> 01:28:51,640
To anything I ever write.

1473
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:55,633
He used to say that
success was incidental.

1474
01:28:57,379 --> 01:29:00,815
Because time moved too fast.

1475
01:29:00,815 --> 01:29:04,808
I guess I just called to...

1476
01:29:04,886 --> 01:29:08,056
I wanted to tell you that...

1477
01:29:08,056 --> 01:29:10,959
I had a real nice time
in Minneapolis with you.

1478
01:29:10,959 --> 01:29:13,962
And um...

1479
01:29:13,962 --> 01:29:17,332
you know, I was wondering if you
were coming out here because...

1480
01:29:17,332 --> 01:29:19,334
I really... I'd like to...

1481
01:29:19,334 --> 01:29:23,327
take you to dinner or out...

1482
01:29:30,645 --> 01:29:34,315
For Christmas?

1483
01:29:34,315 --> 01:29:36,117
Well, it's April...

1484
01:29:36,117 --> 01:29:37,318
(coin drops from payphone)

1485
01:29:37,318 --> 01:29:38,353
Hold on.

1486
01:29:38,353 --> 01:29:42,346
Why the "Insufferable
Hunger of the Damned"?

1487
01:29:42,390 --> 01:29:44,292
I don't know, it's...

1488
01:29:44,292 --> 01:29:48,285
it's the last thing
people want to see.

1489
01:29:48,430 --> 01:29:51,299
I was going to call it
"Eat Shit," but I...

1490
01:29:51,299 --> 01:29:54,202
I figured people
want to see that,

1491
01:29:54,202 --> 01:29:57,472
and you can be sure
no one wants to know about

1492
01:29:57,472 --> 01:30:00,909
the insufferable
hunger of the damned.

1493
01:30:00,909 --> 01:30:04,902
(tapping razor)

1494
01:30:10,285 --> 01:30:14,278
No, I think I'm going to be here
for a while.

1495
01:30:16,324 --> 01:30:18,893
That's just...

1496
01:30:18,893 --> 01:30:22,464
it...

1497
01:30:22,464 --> 01:30:24,399
It's just that
this ain't right.

1498
01:30:24,399 --> 01:30:27,102
I... I can't stand it.

1499
01:30:27,102 --> 01:30:31,095
I'm working all night,
I'm sleeping all day, and...

1500
01:30:33,208 --> 01:30:37,201
You know, this is boring.
I don't want to talk about it.

1501
01:30:39,948 --> 01:30:42,517
You know, in July, I was thinking,

1502
01:30:42,517 --> 01:30:46,510
I was going to go up to Duluth,
have you ever been there?

1503
01:30:48,223 --> 01:30:49,758
Yeah.

1504
01:30:49,758 --> 01:30:52,427
Just, you know, going fishing and...

1505
01:30:52,427 --> 01:30:56,420
live right.

1506
01:30:59,367 --> 01:31:02,036
No, I've got
some family up there.

1507
01:31:02,036 --> 01:31:05,306
Is it about us?

1508
01:31:05,306 --> 01:31:07,375
Yeah.

1509
01:31:07,375 --> 01:31:09,744
It's... everybody.

1510
01:31:09,744 --> 01:31:12,380
That's the point.

1511
01:31:12,380 --> 01:31:16,373
Well, I'd been around the block
a few times before I met him.

1512
01:31:16,818 --> 01:31:20,811
So... I knew,

1513
01:31:20,889 --> 01:31:24,859
for fact, mind you,
not a rumor,

1514
01:31:24,859 --> 01:31:27,362
that he had read the same poem,

1515
01:31:27,362 --> 01:31:30,999
in the same way
to another woman,

1516
01:31:30,999 --> 01:31:32,400
in the same week

1517
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:35,136
that he had read it to me.

1518
01:31:35,136 --> 01:31:39,129
I didn't mind his duplicity.

1519
01:31:39,407 --> 01:31:42,043
There's something beautiful about

1520
01:31:42,043 --> 01:31:45,480
a man who loves too much...

1521
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:49,473
you know, that kind of playboy
I've always understood.

1522
01:31:51,519 --> 01:31:54,989
But he doesn't love anyone.

1523
01:31:54,989 --> 01:31:58,982
He loves art, he loves...

1524
01:32:00,528 --> 01:32:04,098
he loves sex.

1525
01:32:04,098 --> 01:32:08,091
(tapping)

1526
01:32:16,477 --> 01:32:19,848
I'd say...

1527
01:32:19,848 --> 01:32:23,841
that he never loved me.

1528
01:32:24,619 --> 01:32:28,612
He had no respect for me, really.

1529
01:32:28,823 --> 01:32:31,426
He thought he did.

1530
01:32:31,426 --> 01:32:34,162
But...

1531
01:32:34,162 --> 01:32:37,332
when you love someone
and they don't even know

1532
01:32:37,332 --> 01:32:39,834
they don't respect you,

1533
01:32:39,834 --> 01:32:43,827
you've got a real problem
on your hands.

1534
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:48,109
Tell me the dream
one more time.

1535
01:32:48,109 --> 01:32:50,044
We, uh...

1536
01:32:50,044 --> 01:32:52,347
we were walking
in Central Park,

1537
01:32:52,347 --> 01:32:54,382
and it was snowing,

1538
01:32:54,382 --> 01:32:57,118
and the snow was untouched

1539
01:32:57,118 --> 01:32:59,954
except for the footprints
behind us,

1540
01:32:59,954 --> 01:33:02,290
and we were wearing overcoats,

1541
01:33:02,290 --> 01:33:06,027
the expensive kind and...

1542
01:33:06,027 --> 01:33:07,996
we were older and...

1543
01:33:07,996 --> 01:33:10,398
we were happy.

1544
01:33:10,398 --> 01:33:13,101
All I ever think about
is my music.

1545
01:33:13,101 --> 01:33:17,094
I go to bed thinking about it,
I wake up thinking about it...

1546
01:33:17,238 --> 01:33:20,108
I guess that's why
I don't have anyone, you know.

1547
01:33:20,108 --> 01:33:24,101
There's no room.

1548
01:33:24,913 --> 01:33:28,906
I just... I don't...
I just feel like I'm...

1549
01:33:29,550 --> 01:33:33,543
going nowhere fast.

1550
01:33:34,222 --> 01:33:38,126
Audrey: I wish we were
in that dream right now.

1551
01:33:38,126 --> 01:33:42,119
So do I.

1552
01:33:52,273 --> 01:33:54,208
I'll buy you
a fishing license.

1553
01:33:54,208 --> 01:33:57,145
I'll bet you no one
has ever offered you that before.

1554
01:33:57,145 --> 01:34:01,138
(coin dropping)

1555
01:34:03,051 --> 01:34:04,919
Yeah.

1556
01:34:04,919 --> 01:34:06,321
Well...

1557
01:34:06,321 --> 01:34:09,057
if you ever
do come out here,

1558
01:34:09,057 --> 01:34:11,693
or if ever I get home,

1559
01:34:11,693 --> 01:34:14,963
I would like to take you out.

1560
01:34:14,963 --> 01:34:18,599
The core of him was...

1561
01:34:18,599 --> 01:34:21,469
and probably still is,

1562
01:34:21,469 --> 01:34:24,472
cold.

1563
01:34:24,472 --> 01:34:27,275
It said,

1564
01:34:27,275 --> 01:34:30,678
"Baby,

1565
01:34:30,678 --> 01:34:34,671
if it's me or you,

1566
01:34:35,049 --> 01:34:39,042
it's got to be me."

1567
01:34:43,591 --> 01:34:45,526
And...

1568
01:34:45,526 --> 01:34:49,464
I may have a million faults

1569
01:34:49,464 --> 01:34:52,667
and I've made
thousands of mistakes,

1570
01:34:52,667 --> 01:34:55,403
but I've never
been able to look

1571
01:34:55,403 --> 01:34:59,396
into the eyes of the one I love
with cold eyes.

1572
01:35:00,441 --> 01:35:02,577
And...

1573
01:35:02,577 --> 01:35:04,112
he could do that.

1574
01:35:04,112 --> 01:35:06,047
He did do that.

1575
01:35:06,047 --> 01:35:08,383
Take this and...

1576
01:35:08,383 --> 01:35:11,486
don't resist.

1577
01:35:11,486 --> 01:35:13,287
I can't.

1578
01:35:13,287 --> 01:35:14,589
Look,

1579
01:35:14,589 --> 01:35:16,391
if you love me
you'll take it

1580
01:35:16,391 --> 01:35:20,384
and you'll take care
of yourself.

1581
01:35:33,775 --> 01:35:37,768
I'll be back.

1582
01:35:44,752 --> 01:35:47,255
Bud: Get the hell out!

1583
01:35:47,255 --> 01:35:49,457
Bud, it's me.

1584
01:35:49,457 --> 01:35:51,259
It's you?

1585
01:35:51,259 --> 01:35:54,662
There's your goddamn book!

1586
01:35:54,662 --> 01:35:58,655
- Where?
- You're standing on it.

1587
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:01,135
This, uh?

1588
01:36:01,135 --> 01:36:05,128
Yeah, that.

1589
01:36:07,442 --> 01:36:09,277
I'll make some coffee.

1590
01:36:09,277 --> 01:36:11,446
Oh, that's real subtle.

1591
01:36:11,446 --> 01:36:15,439
Why don't you throw me in
a cold shower while you're at it?

1592
01:36:15,583 --> 01:36:18,286
It's not a bad idea.

1593
01:36:18,286 --> 01:36:21,289
Jesus Christ!
You come in here,

1594
01:36:21,289 --> 01:36:24,058
you come in here
like you're my old lady

1595
01:36:24,058 --> 01:36:26,794
and give me that look
like I have to clean up my room.

1596
01:36:26,794 --> 01:36:30,787
You wanted a book?
Well, you got a book.

1597
01:36:32,133 --> 01:36:35,169
At least you put
page numbers on it.

1598
01:36:35,169 --> 01:36:38,339
"At least you put
page numbers on it."

1599
01:36:38,339 --> 01:36:40,441
I'm not a baby!

1600
01:36:40,441 --> 01:36:43,678
I don't need
to be patronized like this!

1601
01:36:43,678 --> 01:36:46,347
No! I will not!

1602
01:36:46,347 --> 01:36:49,150
I refuse for you
to speak to me like that!

1603
01:36:49,150 --> 01:36:53,143
I guess you never get over
a man like that.

1604
01:36:56,190 --> 01:36:58,292
It's very painful

1605
01:36:58,292 --> 01:37:02,285
to fall in love with someone
in the confines of four walls

1606
01:37:03,397 --> 01:37:07,168
where you share everything.

1607
01:37:07,168 --> 01:37:09,837
To be silent
while they work for...

1608
01:37:09,837 --> 01:37:13,574
days sometimes.

1609
01:37:13,574 --> 01:37:15,376
To be...

1610
01:37:15,376 --> 01:37:17,845
taken into it,

1611
01:37:17,845 --> 01:37:19,547
into them,

1612
01:37:19,547 --> 01:37:22,283
their body, spirit.

1613
01:37:22,283 --> 01:37:25,153
To be...

1614
01:37:25,153 --> 01:37:28,222
worshiped and...

1615
01:37:28,222 --> 01:37:31,893
magnified, immortalized.

1616
01:37:31,893 --> 01:37:35,886
And then to see that

1617
01:37:36,931 --> 01:37:39,400
to them,

1618
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:42,203
to Bud,

1619
01:37:42,203 --> 01:37:44,205
it's work.

1620
01:37:44,205 --> 01:37:47,742
I brought you something, I've...

1621
01:37:47,742 --> 01:37:50,444
you left your St. Christopher

1622
01:37:50,444 --> 01:37:54,437
in my office.

1623
01:38:00,521 --> 01:38:04,514
Oh, yeah,
the clasp was broken.

1624
01:38:04,559 --> 01:38:06,260
I had it fixed.

1625
01:38:06,260 --> 01:38:07,695
Thanks a lot.

1626
01:38:07,695 --> 01:38:11,688
Thanks
a whole hell of a lot.

1627
01:38:14,769 --> 01:38:17,438
And I gave
a part of my life to him,

1628
01:38:17,438 --> 01:38:21,431
and I did it willingly.

1629
01:38:24,278 --> 01:38:25,980
And...

1630
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:29,973
I'd like to say,

1631
01:38:30,451 --> 01:38:33,221
and I...

1632
01:38:33,221 --> 01:38:37,214
I never have before, that...

1633
01:38:37,858 --> 01:38:40,628
I was...

1634
01:38:40,628 --> 01:38:43,464
very much in love with

1635
01:38:43,464 --> 01:38:47,457
a great, great man.

1636
01:38:49,337 --> 01:38:53,307
Who despite everything,

1637
01:38:53,307 --> 01:38:54,875
didn't know

1638
01:38:54,875 --> 01:38:58,868
Iove.

1639
01:39:06,420 --> 01:39:08,956
- Man: I'm glad to see you.
- Val: Yeah.

1640
01:39:08,956 --> 01:39:12,949
Man #2: Come on, guys.

1641
01:39:27,575 --> 01:39:31,568
(screeching)

1642
01:39:54,402 --> 01:39:57,271
Poet: Now I am a man

1643
01:39:57,271 --> 01:39:59,373
no more.

1644
01:39:59,373 --> 01:40:01,809
No more.

1645
01:40:01,809 --> 01:40:05,780
And the black reward
for a roaring life,

1646
01:40:05,780 --> 01:40:09,417
Sighed the old ramrod,

1647
01:40:09,417 --> 01:40:13,410
dying of bitches!

1648
01:40:13,821 --> 01:40:17,024
Tidy and cool

1649
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:19,327
in my dove cooed room

1650
01:40:19,327 --> 01:40:23,320
I lie down thin and hear
the good bells jaw...

1651
01:40:26,667 --> 01:40:30,660
For, oh, my soul
found a Sunday wife

1652
01:40:32,106 --> 01:40:34,842
in the coal black night

1653
01:40:34,842 --> 01:40:38,646
and she bore angels!

1654
01:40:38,646 --> 01:40:42,383
Harpies around me
out of her womb.

1655
01:40:42,383 --> 01:40:45,553
Chastity prays for me,
piety sings

1656
01:40:45,553 --> 01:40:48,456
Innocence sweetens
my last black breath,

1657
01:40:48,456 --> 01:40:52,449
Modesty covers
my thighs with her wings.

1658
01:40:53,427 --> 01:40:57,420
And all of the deadly virtues

1659
01:40:57,765 --> 01:40:59,867
plague...

1660
01:40:59,867 --> 01:41:03,860
my death.

1661
01:41:09,877 --> 01:41:13,870
(police radio buzzing faintly)

1662
01:41:23,691 --> 01:41:26,994
(knocking on door)

1663
01:41:26,994 --> 01:41:30,987
(knocking)

1664
01:41:31,632 --> 01:41:35,625
(knocking)

1665
01:41:44,779 --> 01:41:47,548
Poet: clocks with no hands!

1666
01:41:47,548 --> 01:41:50,418
Forever drumming out time

1667
01:41:50,418 --> 01:41:54,411
without ever knowing
what time it is!

1668
01:42:02,730 --> 01:42:04,632
Bud: Christ,

1669
01:42:04,632 --> 01:42:08,625
I think I'm...

1670
01:42:08,736 --> 01:42:11,605
I think I'm hungry.

1671
01:42:11,605 --> 01:42:14,041
I...

1672
01:42:14,041 --> 01:42:15,910
I think I'm...

1673
01:42:15,910 --> 01:42:18,145
just a little...

1674
01:42:18,145 --> 01:42:22,138
tired.

1675
01:42:22,550 --> 01:42:24,618
That's all right.

1676
01:42:24,618 --> 01:42:28,611
Let me get you
something to eat and then...

1677
01:42:29,590 --> 01:42:33,583
we'll put
those pages together.

1678
01:42:34,795 --> 01:42:36,030
No, no, no.

1679
01:42:36,030 --> 01:42:40,023
- Didn't anyone ever tell you?
- Tell me what?

1680
01:42:40,601 --> 01:42:44,594
That all the king's horses
and all the king's men

1681
01:42:46,540 --> 01:42:50,533
couldn't put Humpty-Dumpty
back together again.

1682
01:43:05,593 --> 01:43:07,995
Woman's voice:
I sat there with you,

1683
01:43:07,995 --> 01:43:10,998
you hung on me
with the weight of a bear,

1684
01:43:10,998 --> 01:43:13,267
heavy after some coffee...

1685
01:43:13,267 --> 01:43:15,569
Val: who has
the last word from paradise.

1686
01:43:15,569 --> 01:43:19,562
She came back alive enough to feed
the black tongue of a giraffe.

1687
01:43:19,673 --> 01:43:22,610
Audrey: The memory's landscape

1688
01:43:22,610 --> 01:43:24,578
is enormous.

1689
01:43:24,578 --> 01:43:27,648
Woman: where men and women
really do hate each other.

1690
01:43:27,648 --> 01:43:30,518
I knew that.

1691
01:43:30,518 --> 01:43:32,186
You are another Hamlet.

1692
01:43:32,186 --> 01:43:36,123
Ross: For as
the sailor's proverb goes,

1693
01:43:36,123 --> 01:43:39,527
a sea refuses no river.

1694
01:43:39,527 --> 01:43:42,296
Grace: Is there nothing quite
like the face of a losing man?

1695
01:43:42,296 --> 01:43:46,289
A soldier, a boxer,
a lover, a boy.

1696
01:43:46,967 --> 01:43:49,303
They know.
That greatness falls...

1697
01:43:49,303 --> 01:43:51,972
Frank: Only an American
would bring a canary

1698
01:43:51,972 --> 01:43:54,675
down with him
in the mines.

1699
01:43:54,675 --> 01:43:57,144
Only an American
would make a sport

1700
01:43:57,144 --> 01:43:59,780
where you could
steal home and win.

1701
01:43:59,780 --> 01:44:02,583
Audrey: just wanting
to leave the scene.

1702
01:44:02,583 --> 01:44:05,085
Beautifully leave you.

1703
01:44:05,085 --> 01:44:07,087
In the dust,

1704
01:44:07,087 --> 01:44:09,690
in the jungle,

1705
01:44:09,690 --> 01:44:13,683
luminous in your shadow.

1706
01:44:14,595 --> 01:44:18,588
