1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:07,797
Shochiku-Fuji Presents

2
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:12,937
A KSS/Shochiku Dai-ichi Kogyo Film

3
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,088
While having my hair cut

4
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:06,127
I like to think it's a big waste...

5
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:09,061
to throw away hair

6
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:14,498
Isn't there a way to use human hair
effectively?

7
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:16,574
If hair could...

8
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,177
cure cancer and piles

9
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:22,870
the discovery would bring me a fortune

10
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:27,286
Won't it raise money?

11
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:30,855
That's why I still keep it

12
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:40,191
The same with rocks in a riverbed

13
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:44,362
How can I raise money from them?

14
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:47,339
Poverty dulls the wit

15
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,336
How can I get an idea?

16
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:52,511
SECONDHAND BOOKSTORE

17
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:25,244
At a nearby store,
I found a book about rocks

18
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:27,843
It told me that rocks can be...

19
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:31,106
salable as art objects

20
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,750
I got so excited my hands sweated

21
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,491
ROCKS

22
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:44,961
Eventually I opened a rock shop

23
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:49,463
I'd drawn comics,
sold secondhand cameras...

24
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:52,360
But I couldn't make it

25
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:56,073
No money to open a shop in town

26
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:17,489

Directed by Naoto Takenaka

41
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:49,885
Why don't they sell?

42
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:57,557
It's still cold, and few people...

43
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:19,851
Selling those rocks?

44
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:27,783
Helping your dad?

45
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:29,718
Good boy!

46
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:39,138
Take a look, dear

47
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:44,009
Rocks have beauty, too

48
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,445
Where did you get this?

49
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,218
In this riverbed

50
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,354
I guessed so

51
00:05:56,989 --> 00:06:01,153
Who would ever buy any rocks found
here?

52
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,993
They're different

53
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:09,894
Oh, in what way?

54
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,737
Their form and elegance

55
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:14,004
Elegance?

56
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,905
A rock can represent a mountain

57
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,937
a valley, clouds, wind, the universe...

58
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,275
Let's go

59
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,544
Sorry

60
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,955
What's wrong? You keep birds

61
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:42,124
Dunce! Don't mix rocks with birds

62
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:46,395
He needs cash. He'd sell anything

63
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:56,841
Dad...

64
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:04,255
They don't know how valuable
rocks can be

65
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:14,326
Lots of cut-rate books
when the boom ended

66
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,534
But they're gone too now

67
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,439
Aren't there good rocks
in that riverbed?

68
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:25,839
Why not sell your comics?

69
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,707
Actually one of your fans came

70
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,783
He left this

71
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,620
My last one

72
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,589
Your old books get very good prices

73
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:42,258
Ironical!

74
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:46,331
He wants to exchange it
for your originals

75
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:51,200
How about 10,000 yen for
three originals?

76
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,098
No originals

77
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:56,337
I gave them to charity bazaars

78
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:58,334
What a waste!

79
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,314
My wife left me

80
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,245
She left home

81
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:20,058
To women, incapable men are
pure scum

82
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:34,005
He said they were discontinued

83
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:36,681
But I found a few

84
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,574
What about the auction?

85
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,548
A Mr. Sekiun said to come
for an application form

86
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:42,582
"At a temple next month...

87
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:44,320
"10,000 yen table charge"?

88
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,616
Space for rocks

89
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,589
What if our rocks don't sell?

90
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,352
It's investment

91
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,460
Listen seriously

92
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:55,632
It's ridiculous!

93
00:08:57,136 --> 00:09:03,405
Where's the cash?
You can't even buy me a skirt

94
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:07,736
You scrimp on gas and bath water

95
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:10,411
What can you do?

96
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:14,915
I hate poverty.
I'm worried about our living

97
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:16,586
Then draw comics

98
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:19,120
No orders for five years

99
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,221
You were popular

100
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:27,296
You're conceited. You think you're...

101
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,363
an artist, but comics aren't art

102
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,567
Self-conceit makes no sense!

103
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:35,474
Self-conceit? Why belittle me, huh?

104
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,370
Comics aren't my lifework

105
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:41,774
I'll become a big-shot rock dealer

106
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,379
Massage me

107
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:47,549
I won't pass out leaflets forever

108
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:51,814
I tell the neighbors
I walk for health's sake

109
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,092
But I get tired, that's all

110
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,229
Ma'am...

111
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,594
Yes?

112
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:04,530
Train fare

113
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,900
STONE-FANATICS ASSOCIATION

114
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:46,834
SEKIUN ISHIYAMMA

115
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,708
Hello!

116
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:26,951
You must be Mr. Sukegawa

117
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:33,291
That door's broken. Will you fix it?

118
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:16,992
Sorry, nails won't work

119
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:25,234
Sorry to bother you. My man can't do it.
Come in

120
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:34,948
Excuse me

121
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:48,596
I'm Sekiun Ishiyama, the president

122
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:55,706
He's Karuishi, an expert
at finding good rocks

123
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,702
My disciple

124
00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:59,706
How do you do

125
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:04,072
Write your name, address

126
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,511
and where you get your rocks

127
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:21,761
Tama River? Natural rocks?

128
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:25,266
New, natural rocks are popular

129
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:28,368
They can include excellent ones

130
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,538
I'm just a beginner

131
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:34,008
I have no good ones

132
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:37,841
The Tama River sometimes has
good rocks

133
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,050
Only upstream rocks can be good

134
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:44,880
Downstream rocks are too common

135
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:47,020
Keep out of this!

136
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:52,994
I find rocks near a movie studio

137
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,032
We used to go there ourselves

138
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:59,269
We often went walking

139
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:01,898
We sure did

140
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,768
We found this
"Water Containing Rock" there

141
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,912
Someone wanted it for 100,000 yen

142
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,274
100,000 yen?!

143
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:19,483
Rock-appreciating started
in the 14th century

144
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:22,623
It originated in China

145
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,727
In the 18th century

146
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:31,525
an appreciation method
was established:

147
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:33,500
A rock on a sand-filled tray

148
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,740
"Suiseki," or rock and water

149
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:42,674
"Bonkei" or miniscape,
consists of several rocks

150
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:44,713
"Bonkei" can use several rocks, but

151
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,814
"Suiseki" must express a landscape
with only one rock

152
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:50,820
"Bonkei" is human performance

153
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,923
"Suiseki" requires natural beauty

154
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:04,192
I'll take this

155
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:05,663
Thank you very much

156
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:08,371
200 yen

157
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,644
Mrs. Sukegawa

158
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:18,211
Chinese cabbage is cheap

159
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,781
I'll take pickled cabbage

160
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:25,889
My shop needs a part-time cashier.
Why not do it?

161
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:30,351
The more I work, the lazier my man gets

162
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:33,793
He's selling rocks this time?

163
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:37,261
While trying out many things,
he'll make it

164
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:39,469
Lottery's better

165
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:48,544
I had a Kaji as my senior

166
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:51,611
A real expert

167
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,977
Karuishi's no match for him

168
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:58,356
He was a konjak dealer

169
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:01,219
One day he asked me:

170
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:07,460
"How many eyes do you use to see
rocks?"

171
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:10,800
I answered, "Two." Then he said:

172
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:15,473
"That's not enough.
You need four eyes to see rocks

173
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:20,541
"And rocks are like konjak"

174
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:23,771
I said, "Rocks are hard; konjak, soft."

175
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,043
He replied, "You're still a novice.

176
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:30,754
"Rocks are just like konjak; they are

177
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:34,150
"warm and very soft."

178
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,592
Lately

179
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:39,856
I've begun to understand what he meant

180
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:41,999
Let me show you something

181
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:45,199
A "Figure Rock," but this type is...

182
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:49,371
extremely commonplace

183
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,574
It lacks elegance

184
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:59,776
But the way it gets wet...

185
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:03,111
It's the best one I've ever seen

186
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:24,434
How many times have I had to hear
that lecture!

187
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:29,305
He has only expensive rocks.
Worth a fortune

188
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:34,111
No, no. They aren't his rocks

189
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:38,222
We dealers consign them to him
for sales

190
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,321
We use his influence to sell them to...

191
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:42,819
rich people

192
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:45,826
And he takes a big margin

193
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:50,028
And seldom pays us dealers

194
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:54,797
Business with him is risky

195
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:58,943
But he has lots of experience

196
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,471
Why not drink?

197
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,321
Not me

198
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:14,321
Let's drink to our friendship

199
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:15,957
I'm in a hurry

200
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:19,520
Where are you going?

201
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,812
Is it money? I have some

202
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:18,087
Your case is difficult

203
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,157
You look so tender your guts don't show

204
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:25,257
Show your guts more openly

205
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,862
You sure?

206
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,067
Don't talk like that

207
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,199
Listen

208
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,669
Watch out for Sekiun's wife

209
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:42,310
She was ogling you with hungry eyes

210
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:49,450
She's a slut

211
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:52,482
He booted out five of our fellow dealers

212
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:58,195
after they had flirtations with her

213
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:07,900
Sake made him ill,
and he became impotent

214
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,199
She had a reason then

215
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:15,577
She was the wife
of a public bathhouse owner

216
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:23,045
It's gone now,
because a bad dealer grabbed it

217
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:28,521
It was deep in the mountains,
there were few clients

218
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:34,597
Then Sekiun arrived to stay
for a few days

219
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:40,730
And he ran off with
the bathhouse owner's wife

220
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:07,322
Her husband was...

221
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:11,394
me!

222
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:19,175
While going to Sekiun's place
many times

223
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:23,848
trying to get back Tatsuko

224
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:27,176
he taught me about rocks

225
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:33,686
I'd lived by catching fish and snakes

226
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,325
and making bird houses

227
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,552
Mine was such a poor life!

228
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:44,235
So I obeyed Sekiun till I could live on
rocks

229
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:50,664
But... when I stayed there last night...

230
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:54,739
What happened?

231
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:14,025
He made me clean the toilet!

232
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,404
It's love

233
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:28,045
Love

234
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:52,593
Sukegawa speaking

235
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,237
Sato from the comic magazine

236
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:57,701
Been a long time. How are you?

237
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:01,874
My husband's out now

238
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:05,674
A job?

239
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:10,554
No "entertaining" comics, please

240
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:15,159
He said comics aren't his life's work

241
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:18,357
Hey!

242
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:27,968
He's back. Hold the line please

243
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,235
He's offering a job

244
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:33,200
Speaking

245
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,277
Been a long time.

246
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:37,708
Has she told you?

247
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:41,077
We have an original story.
Why not try it?

248
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:44,484
Thanks, but no more
"entertaining" comics

249
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:45,850
Hey!

250
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:54,164
What a mess!

251
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:59,860
Why not at least read the story?

252
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:03,006
I'm busy. The auction's coming

253
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,601
You've changed

254
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:09,042
You're only worsening yourself

255
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:13,944
I miss the time
you were drawing comics

256
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:11,535
Well?

257
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:14,705
I like it

258
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,676
It's almost art

259
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:19,349
Glad to hear

260
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:22,544
How's your work?

261
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:28,392
I've got used to it.
A big hit at my counter

262
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,057
Why don't you try it?

263
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:37,292
Visit me. I'm lonely

264
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:41,505
Only a small hole there.
We can't see each other

265
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:46,541
Just put in your hand. I'll hold it

266
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:49,043
That's not necessary now

267
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:11,535
Make sure.

268
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:19,174
Make sure.

269
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:24,609
Make sure.

270
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,542
6-6

271
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:20,938
Mister, snap it up!

272
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:51,660
Good evening

273
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:56,264
Why so upset?

274
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,976
I was glad!

275
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:02,305
I held your hand

276
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:05,415
It was so exciting!

277
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:12,222
The ticket lost

278
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:16,419
You sure it was my hand?

279
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:21,598
Sure. It was stained with ink

280
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,294
How dull!

281
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:30,772
I really was glad

282
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,088
Beautiful sunset!

283
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,322
You bashful?

284
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:15,986
It's dad! He's going somewhere!

285
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:18,681
It's dad!

286
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,378
Ma'am!

287
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:10,291
Your family told me you're here

288
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:16,529
I'm surprised you're doing business
here

289
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,161
I drank too much water

290
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:24,003
Take your time

291
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:02,573
A meadow bunting

292
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:05,808
A gold finch

293
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:09,481
You know, huh?

294
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:12,646
I'm a bird-hunter's daughter

295
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:15,017
A bird-hunter

296
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:16,487
Really?

297
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:20,295
My father traps birds...

298
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:24,532
deep in the mountains

299
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:28,697
I long for such a life

300
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:35,874
It wasn't easy for me. I had to wait

301
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:41,279
He wouldn't come home for a long time

302
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:48,053
When you first came to our place,
I thought

303
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:54,322
Your ears looked like my father's

304
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:56,227
My ears?

305
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:59,336
Only your ears

306
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:06,701
Whenever my dad came home,
I cleaned his ears

307
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:09,739
His ears full of wax

308
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:15,242
Oh!

309
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:19,486
How awful!

310
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,758
Lovers are around at night

311
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:31,600
There are many hotels, too

312
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:44,542
The rivers made me cold

313
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:55,222
Why not rest?

314
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:01,624
Listen, is it okay?

315
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,659
I...

316
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:10,568
I can't have children

317
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:16,276
Dad!

318
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:25,488
I came for you

319
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:48,873
What poor grub!

320
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:51,844
Wait till rocks sell

321
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,852
Don't force yourself to eat

322
00:35:57,922 --> 00:35:59,719
I'll eat

323
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:03,221
Tasty radishes

324
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:05,787
I picked them at the river

325
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,794
The river?

326
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:10,524
Then...

327
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:14,669
A neighbor's crops!

328
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:13,556
"Stone Hunting: The Latest Fashion"

329
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:24,238
Renting boats isn't bad

330
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:29,573
It makes 800 yen in three minutes

331
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:34,583
A carrier could make only 20 yen

332
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:37,783
The carrier died

333
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:43,292
Mister, may I leave these here?

334
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:54,266
You sell stones?

335
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:04,948
Why not ask a curio shop to sell
this stuff?

336
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,452
What's this?

337
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:11,553
"Lone Boat"

338
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:13,649
I see

339
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:15,586
Why not buy one?

340
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:20,120
"Sorrow, Anger, Understanding, Wind"

341
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:26,903
"Degradation, Despair...

342
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:31,537
"Uneasiness, Repenting, Tears"

343
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:33,904
Just like me

344
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,508
See to that

345
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:46,222
ROCKS

346
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:41,734
You like it?

347
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:56,885
You're the first to like my rocks

348
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:58,618
Keep it. It's yours

349
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:07,696
I don't want money. Take it

350
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:48,277
Want to sell that bird?

351
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:49,706
I don't sell birds

352
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:22,503
Listen...

353
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:28,513
You'll sell that bird?

354
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,915
I'm asking you...

355
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:34,755
if you'll sell that white-eye?

356
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:43,397
80,000 yen?

357
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:47,570
I was amazed

358
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:50,965
Half the money's fine. I'm lucky

359
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:54,702
You could've sold it for twice that

360
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:55,968
Twice?

361
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:58,306
You missed out

362
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:01,977
So, he's still around

363
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:03,377
Who?

364
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:06,484
The man with the white-eye

365
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:10,558
He's "Bird Man"

366
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:15,524
A mute would come to sell birds
to a shop...

367
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:19,202
in back of the bicycle racetrack

368
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:23,167
He was known
for bringing only good birds

369
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:27,000
I must pay him. Where is he?

370
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:30,236
No one knew what he really was

371
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:35,577
I heard he lived at a shrine then

372
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:04,179
He was at the river

373
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:08,784
He received only half the money

374
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:15,918
I know we need money to live

375
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:19,459
But we'll invest this in my business

376
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:23,566
We'll go somewhere to hunt for rocks

377
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,257
No means. No

378
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:28,834
We'll go together, the three of us

379
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:43,278
A change of mood

380
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,146
Great! The train schedule

381
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:49,284
An expert named Karuishi...

382
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:51,720
will direct us to a river

383
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:53,463
Already arranged?

384
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:57,397
We'll take an express train from here

385
00:43:57,568 --> 00:43:58,694
No

386
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:00,500
Good rocks there

387
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:02,365
A slow train's better

388
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:04,038
Why?

389
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:08,041
We can enjoy the trip more fully

390
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,117
What time do we get there?

391
00:44:22,626 --> 00:44:23,558
After 10

392
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:24,818
10 what?

393
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:25,790
10:02

394
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,497
What station?

395
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:29,722
Oh, shut up!

396
00:44:30,267 --> 00:44:33,759
Let's get ready one station in advance

397
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:39,231
We'll arrive in 22 minutes

398
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:57,559
The truck will take us

399
00:44:58,462 --> 00:45:00,794
He didn't come. Why care?

400
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:02,757
I'm worried about him

401
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:04,831
Can we trust this Karuishi?

402
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:06,127
Shut up and hurry!

403
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:07,435
You sure?

404
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:09,228
Get in the truck!

405
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:10,837
You sure?

406
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:21,874
Take a look

407
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:27,385
A criminal case? Don't involve me

408
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:32,017
Mr. Yamakawa!

409
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:35,692
Karuishi!

410
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:37,197
Listen...

411
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:51,473
I'm sorry... I couldn't meet you

412
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:54,512
Please come in

413
00:46:05,195 --> 00:46:06,685
A viper?

414
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:09,695
The doc came too late

415
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,868
I was worried

416
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:16,199
It's only you who say such things to me

417
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:19,942
Don't vipers hibernate?

418
00:46:20,077 --> 00:46:25,310
I expect they'll grow fast
if they don't hibernate

419
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:28,543
So I'm trying to raise them here

420
00:46:28,752 --> 00:46:31,949
Rocks can't make enough money

421
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:33,781
Vipers make money?

422
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:34,785
Stop it

423
00:46:34,992 --> 00:46:37,392
What are vipers?

424
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:42,088
Sonny, roll up that black cloth

425
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:47,462
Mom!

426
00:46:49,072 --> 00:46:50,937
You all right?

427
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:53,967
I feel great after...

428
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:56,606
yelling so loud

429
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,678
Vipers look like snakes

430
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:07,355
There it is

431
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:10,024
There was a landslide

432
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,820
Maybe you can get good rocks

433
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,122
Think so?

434
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:18,194
I'm sorry that I can't go with you

435
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:21,200
It's because I jerked off last night

436
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:25,136
When I shot...

437
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:29,438
I kicked the vipers' basket

438
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,913
I do it often, but it's...

439
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:37,210
my first time to make such a mistake

440
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,883
What about that?

441
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:48,425
I stole it from Sekiun's place

442
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:52,000
Tatsuko always overlooks it

443
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:54,998
She really is a kind person

444
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:52,284
So many ups and downs

445
00:48:52,529 --> 00:48:53,894
It's like life

446
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:56,054
You look cheerful

447
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:59,532
It's nice to be free from daily life

448
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:03,962
I hope we can get good rocks here

449
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,013
BLOCKED OWING TO LANDSLIDE

450
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:20,951
Why?!

451
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:35,235
To hell with rocks! My shoes are worn

452
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:39,668
This is how you are

453
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:43,812
You have no sense

454
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:50,617
Looks like a family suicide

455
00:49:51,088 --> 00:49:52,749
It won't be bad

456
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:57,724
We have no bright future

457
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:01,798
We'll get old, that's all

458
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:16,803
Hello?

459
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:20,106
Let's go. Staying makes no sense

460
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:21,716
We'll stay and relax

461
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:22,885
Let's go

462
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,319
May I help you?

463
00:50:27,557 --> 00:50:29,548
Let us stay here

464
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:33,090
Old man!

465
00:50:40,604 --> 00:50:43,835
"I don't think you know
how radishes feel...

466
00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:48,168
"Mom and Dad were scattering
nightsoil..."

467
00:50:50,113 --> 00:50:51,876
You farted

468
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:56,210
Help yourselves

469
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:05,352
Let's eat!

470
00:51:05,662 --> 00:51:07,027
It's only 5 PM

471
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,664
There's lots of rice

472
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,699
What's this?

473
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,336
Boiled and vinegared radishes

474
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:18,769
Radish soup, pickled radish leaves

475
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:21,976
Humble grub!

476
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:24,510
The fee's so cheap

477
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:29,611
Look at that laundray. What a joint!

478
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:32,880
No TV... even a dresser

479
00:51:33,156 --> 00:51:34,316
Don't gripe

480
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:35,822
But...

481
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:38,888
You picked this mill

482
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:41,627
You've never done me good

483
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:43,456
Don't blame me!

484
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,567
Some women's pussies bring bad luck

485
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:50,401
About yours, don't tell me

486
00:51:51,141 --> 00:51:52,938
How crass!

487
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:56,737
They said mine brings good luck

488
00:51:57,047 --> 00:51:58,810
"They"?

489
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:02,342
Years ago

490
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:23,439
A strolling priest. How rare!

491
00:52:23,673 --> 00:52:25,834
Are they still around?

492
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:33,907
Is he a Buddhist priest?

493
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:36,010
I don't think so

494
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:38,745
He's more like a beggar

495
00:53:39,115 --> 00:53:40,446
A beggar?

496
00:53:40,684 --> 00:53:42,618
He's useless

497
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:45,788
A dropout in this affluent society

498
00:53:46,423 --> 00:53:48,550
Useless and incapable?

499
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:50,292
Exactly

500
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:51,957
He's like you

501
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:22,886
Sukezo...

502
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,858
What are you thinking?

503
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:30,263
Do priests make money?

504
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:33,397
I don't want to be a priest

505
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:42,478
Hear that?

506
00:54:45,382 --> 00:54:47,714
At this hour?

507
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:52,251
How melancholy!

508
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:56,052
I feel lonely

509
00:54:57,527 --> 00:55:01,395
I wonder what'll happen to us

510
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:11,967
Come to think of it.
We have no close friends

511
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:15,234
We seldom meet our folks

512
00:55:15,545 --> 00:55:18,309
We're isolated

513
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:24,185
It's like we three are alone
in this vast universe

514
00:55:24,454 --> 00:55:28,049
So what? What's wrong with
being alone?

515
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,613
What kept you?

516
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:06,420
They asked for a service charge!
They'd done nothing!

517
00:56:07,263 --> 00:56:08,321
Where is he?

518
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:09,489
Pissing

519
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:11,395
Be more careful

520
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:14,536
Sansuke!

521
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:16,135
Dad!

522
00:56:16,806 --> 00:56:19,331
I found a rock!

523
00:56:20,276 --> 00:56:23,109
The bus is coming

524
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,481
Here's the bus!

525
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:31,145
Sukezo!

526
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:38,857
Sorry to make you wait

527
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:41,857
A rock, Dad! Really!

528
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:44,730
The bus is waiting

529
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,031
A rock!

530
00:56:49,272 --> 00:56:50,739
Hurry!

531
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,941
A rock!

532
00:56:56,379 --> 00:56:58,210
Where is it?

533
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:01,717
Where is it?

534
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:04,152
That one?

535
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:07,215
It has nice lines!

536
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:09,048
Lines?

537
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:26,873
Looks good

538
00:57:27,143 --> 00:57:29,134
The landslide helped

539
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:30,073
Name it?

540
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:31,506
"Waterfall"

541
00:57:31,681 --> 00:57:34,309
Two waterfalls. Called it
"Married Couple"

542
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:36,678
At the auction

543
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:44,224
It'll sell for 100,000 - no - 200,000 yen

544
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:46,194
Too optimistic

545
00:57:46,362 --> 00:57:48,728
Stone-fans are decreasing

546
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:51,331
People don't know what's good

547
00:57:51,568 --> 00:57:54,537
They think it's old-fashioned

548
00:57:54,737 --> 00:57:58,571
Naming in foreign languages is
the rage

549
00:57:58,741 --> 00:58:01,733
What about your sign?

550
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:07,580
That? I'm just pretending to be
timeserving

551
00:58:07,884 --> 00:58:09,647
That's what pros do

552
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:17,483
Is your wife back?

553
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:22,992
ROCK AUCTION

554
00:58:36,212 --> 00:58:38,908
How many times must I tell you?

555
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:41,409
Do it carefully

556
00:58:43,419 --> 00:58:45,011
Okay?

557
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:04,568
Choose an angle so the rock looks best

558
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,200
Like this?

559
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:16,307
I'm sure it'll sell

560
00:59:21,791 --> 00:59:23,122
Excuse me

561
00:59:32,368 --> 00:59:38,534
Our rocks are just as good as
the others

562
00:59:39,876 --> 00:59:42,174
I hope they sell

563
00:59:42,979 --> 00:59:48,246
If they sell, we'll buy a coat for Sansuke

564
00:59:50,453 --> 00:59:51,784
For you too

565
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:56,354
Tatsuko wants you

566
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,385
You look lovely

567
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:04,493
You haven't paid your admission

568
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:06,132
Sorry

569
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:08,804
But we paid the table charge

570
01:00:09,072 --> 01:00:11,199
1,000 yen for one, it includes...

571
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:13,007
lunch and tea

572
01:00:13,343 --> 01:00:15,311
Pay 3,000 yen

573
01:00:18,581 --> 01:00:21,049
If it's for lunch

574
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:27,018
my son doesn't eat much
so I'll pay for two

575
01:00:29,592 --> 01:00:32,584
I'll give you extra chopsticks

576
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:35,625
They're 500 yen lunches!

577
01:00:35,832 --> 01:00:37,732
What a rake-off!

578
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:39,797
Just keep quiet

579
01:00:40,436 --> 01:00:43,530
Pay another 1,000

580
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:45,537
What a waste!

581
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:49,404
Let me tell you something:

582
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:53,106
If your rock sells, you must pay us 10% of...

583
01:00:53,383 --> 01:00:56,682
the price, understand?

584
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:57,748
I know

585
01:00:57,954 --> 01:00:59,080
What a woman!

586
01:00:59,455 --> 01:01:00,513
Don't say that

587
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:02,791
Sorry

588
01:01:18,274 --> 01:01:20,936
"Three Waves" from the Kanra River

589
01:01:21,744 --> 01:01:26,977
We'll start with 3,000 yen. 3,000 yen!

590
01:01:28,084 --> 01:01:29,551
See it glitter?

591
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:32,412
No one wants it?

592
01:01:32,655 --> 01:01:34,122
Next

593
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:37,084
We should've started with a better rock

594
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,791
A better one, then

595
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:44,624
Hurry! What's keeping you?

596
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:49,994
"Crag Form" form the Saji River

597
01:01:51,074 --> 01:01:53,508
7,000 yen!

598
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:56,769
Only 7,000 yen for that?

599
01:01:56,979 --> 01:01:58,537
And no one buys it

600
01:01:58,748 --> 01:02:02,275
7,000. No one wants it?

601
01:02:02,518 --> 01:02:05,510
Why don't you buy it?

602
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:07,815
What about ours?

603
01:02:08,024 --> 01:02:09,753
They're special

604
01:02:10,126 --> 01:02:13,027
Quit worrying and wait

605
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:15,795
It's so dull today

606
01:02:16,132 --> 01:02:17,622
Where to?

607
01:02:19,001 --> 01:02:22,459
"Mt. Fuji" from the Sakawa River

608
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:25,200
5,000 yen!

609
01:02:26,843 --> 01:02:32,145
Anyone want it?

610
01:02:40,823 --> 01:02:43,257
It's almost our turn

611
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:48,827
I feel sick

612
01:02:52,502 --> 01:02:55,130
You're timid

613
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:01,133
Dad...

614
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:13,545
ORACLES

615
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:17,952
From the Kamo River. 4,000 yen

616
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:21,094
Anyone want it? 4,000 yen

617
01:03:21,397 --> 01:03:24,332
4,000 yen? No deal

618
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:26,457
Next!

619
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:28,126
Please do your best

620
01:03:28,671 --> 01:03:30,502
Sansuke!

621
01:03:31,574 --> 01:03:32,802
Sorry

622
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:36,100
Sorry

623
01:03:42,752 --> 01:03:46,347
Unlucky

624
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:51,889
"Boat" from the Tama River. 2,000

625
01:03:52,295 --> 01:03:54,024
Anyone want it?

626
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:56,158
Start with 5,000 yen!

627
01:03:56,399 --> 01:03:57,889
2,000!

628
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:02,196
Leave the starting price
to the auctioneer

629
01:04:02,471 --> 01:04:05,963
Newcomers have no right to complain

630
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:07,809
Go away!

631
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:10,043
2,000 yen

632
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:13,074
Anyone want it?

633
01:04:13,382 --> 01:04:14,906
Only 2,000 yen?

634
01:04:15,484 --> 01:04:17,349
Only 2,000 yen

635
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,154
Everyone's silent

636
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:21,383
Next

637
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:24,319
"Married Couple"

638
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:25,892
10000

639
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:32,128
10000

640
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,803
11000

641
01:04:36,138 --> 01:04:37,901
13000

642
01:04:39,075 --> 01:04:40,337
15000

643
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:41,805
16000

644
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:45,476
17000

645
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:49,147
18,000? Do I hear 18,000?

646
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:54,288
Very well, for 17,000 yen...

647
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:56,585
20,000!

648
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:01,954
21,000!

649
01:05:02,164 --> 01:05:03,426
25,000!

650
01:05:07,536 --> 01:05:09,333
26,000!

651
01:05:12,608 --> 01:05:13,905
30,000!

652
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:16,476
31,000!

653
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:21,046
40,000!

654
01:05:22,218 --> 01:05:25,847
41,000? Do I hear 41,000?

655
01:05:28,557 --> 01:05:30,024
41,000!

656
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:31,419
50,000!

657
01:05:45,574 --> 01:05:49,135
Don't do two things at the same time

658
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:03,087
It went for 50,000 yen

659
01:06:03,392 --> 01:06:06,657
So pay 5,000 yen

660
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:24,809
Any money left?

661
01:06:29,685 --> 01:06:31,380
We'll take them home ourselves

662
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:50,601
Let's go

663
01:06:56,545 --> 01:06:57,944
What's wrong?

664
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:01,479
I'm fed up with rocks!

665
01:07:17,266 --> 01:07:19,928
What are you doing?

666
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:24,672
Stop!

667
01:07:26,342 --> 01:07:29,573
Why must you do this?

668
01:07:29,945 --> 01:07:32,675
You always cause me trouble

669
01:07:32,982 --> 01:07:35,416
I can't stand it!

670
01:07:36,485 --> 01:07:41,013
You weren't serious about
any other work

671
01:07:42,691 --> 01:07:47,492
I know it

672
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:55,163
So why do this?

673
01:07:56,372 --> 01:07:59,170
Why? Why must you do this?

674
01:07:59,341 --> 01:08:01,832
All you can do is comics

675
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:04,740
So draw them even though
no one asks you

676
01:08:05,147 --> 01:08:07,138
Just draw them

677
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:09,712
You're a fool!

678
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:10,908
Fool!

679
01:08:46,088 --> 01:08:49,615
What's wrong?

680
01:08:54,196 --> 01:08:55,356
Come in

681
01:09:03,906 --> 01:09:05,237
You all right?

682
01:09:06,342 --> 01:09:07,775
Stay here

683
01:09:08,611 --> 01:09:10,078
I'll get a taxi

684
01:09:15,084 --> 01:09:16,915
I'll be back soon

685
01:10:53,148 --> 01:10:54,615
Fly

686
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:58,451
Fly

687
01:11:02,324 --> 01:11:03,985
Fly!

688
01:12:00,849 --> 01:12:04,080
Sorry to keep you

689
01:12:13,295 --> 01:12:16,264
We'll have him dissected

690
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:20,066
I'm sorry you're involved

691
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:23,168
His relatives?

692
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:25,239
He's unidentified

693
01:12:25,641 --> 01:12:28,906
Maybe he was regarded as dead

694
01:12:31,647 --> 01:12:36,107
Anyone can be regarded as dead

695
01:12:36,318 --> 01:12:38,946
It's often so with bums
7 years after he becomes missing

696
01:12:39,154 --> 01:12:44,319
It'll like they're dead

697
01:13:13,322 --> 01:13:15,984
It's time to go to the shop

698
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:22,789
Dad...

699
01:13:22,931 --> 01:13:24,762
Shut up!

700
01:13:46,722 --> 01:13:50,453
Got it?

701
01:13:53,529 --> 01:13:57,226
I'm Sukegawa. How do you do?

702
01:13:57,566 --> 01:14:00,797
I'm Sukegawa. How do you do?

703
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:19,845
Mister!

704
01:14:23,892 --> 01:14:26,827
Don't get funny ideas

705
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:29,088
That's not it

706
01:14:33,202 --> 01:14:38,401
A guy fell last night.

707
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:46,242
He'll do the same
Don't end up like him

708
01:15:22,451 --> 01:15:23,941
Mom...

709
01:15:24,286 --> 01:15:28,518
Mom, piss

710
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:32,016
Piss by yourself

711
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:34,219
I already did

712
01:19:30,799 --> 01:19:32,562
Are you busy?

713
01:19:32,801 --> 01:19:34,393
No

714
01:19:59,361 --> 01:20:02,626
What's the matter?

715
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:05,793
Say something

716
01:20:23,351 --> 01:20:25,285
What did you say?

717
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:26,487
Nothing

718
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:27,883
Liar

719
01:20:51,146 --> 01:20:53,171
Let me keep that

720
01:20:57,519 --> 01:20:59,009
What'll it be?

721
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:02,484
Coffee

722
01:21:08,563 --> 01:21:12,192
Yours doesn't suit our line

723
01:21:12,634 --> 01:21:14,625
I'm sorry

724
01:21:15,303 --> 01:21:17,965
That's all right. Thanks

725
01:21:18,406 --> 01:21:21,807
Shall I introduce other publishers?

726
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:24,144
You were the last one

727
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:27,047
We were?

728
01:21:29,251 --> 01:21:32,550
Today's editors are young

729
01:21:32,921 --> 01:21:35,185
They flatly refused

730
01:21:35,757 --> 01:21:38,453
They have no head

731
01:21:39,995 --> 01:21:45,262
I never thought my work

732
01:21:48,837 --> 01:21:53,672
Do you remember that mahjong story?
Would be turned down

733
01:21:54,209 --> 01:22:00,273
Our desk is interested. Why not try it?

734
01:22:00,515 --> 01:22:04,884
If you make it, they'll accept that, too

735
01:22:05,854 --> 01:22:07,913
I don't want to

736
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:13,219
I hate to say this

737
01:22:13,428 --> 01:22:18,798
How do you support your family?
But aren't you too choosey?

738
01:22:22,804 --> 01:22:24,465
Hell!

739
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:26,834
You'll get old, too

740
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:33,746
You used to draw many kinds.

741
01:22:33,882 --> 01:22:35,975
It's painful to draw
You can do it

742
01:22:36,151 --> 01:22:39,780
You can overcome it

743
01:22:40,055 --> 01:22:42,615
You're lazy

744
01:22:42,924 --> 01:22:45,449
Being lazy is easy

745
01:22:46,394 --> 01:22:49,158
Be more serious!

746
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,814
Dad...

747
01:26:32,053 --> 01:26:33,213
Out!

748
01:26:34,556 --> 01:26:35,853
Get out!

749
01:26:36,124 --> 01:26:37,648
This is my place!

750
01:27:15,830 --> 01:27:17,024
I'm back

751
01:27:57,639 --> 01:27:59,630
Everything's changed

752
01:28:03,878 --> 01:28:06,506
My comics won't sell

753
01:28:08,583 --> 01:28:12,110
The bath is ready

754
01:28:44,218 --> 01:28:47,016
"Fly! Fly! I said fly!"

755
01:28:47,422 --> 01:28:51,449
"Take me with you"

756
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:34,225
About our future...

757
01:29:34,469 --> 01:29:39,270
We need money for Sansuke's school

758
01:29:39,474 --> 01:29:42,375
I'll work as a carrier
and things

759
01:29:43,044 --> 01:29:46,502
There was an old carrier near...

760
01:29:46,714 --> 01:29:50,115
the cycle racetrack, so I'll do it

761
01:29:50,785 --> 01:29:54,186
Maybe I can get 50 yen per person

762
01:29:54,422 --> 01:29:58,415
1,500 yen a day.

763
01:29:58,659 --> 01:30:03,096
10,000 yen on a race day.
36,000 yen for 24 days

764
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:05,229
That's 96,000 yen
60,000 for 6 days

765
01:30:05,299 --> 01:30:09,895
You're working, too.

766
01:30:10,538 --> 01:30:13,996
I'll sell pop, drinks and rocks, too
We can earn a living

767
01:30:14,308 --> 01:30:16,401
Multiple management

768
01:30:16,611 --> 01:30:18,545
What'll it cost?

769
01:30:18,713 --> 01:30:22,308
500,000. I'll make the preparations

770
01:30:23,151 --> 01:30:25,176
Where's the cash?

771
01:30:28,689 --> 01:30:32,216
You can do as you like

772
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:35,487
Sansuke and I will manage

773
01:30:35,797 --> 01:30:37,128
Leaving me?

774
01:30:37,331 --> 01:30:42,200
You want to leave us, right?

775
01:30:43,070 --> 01:30:44,970
Quit drawing comics?
Fly anywhere

776
01:30:45,139 --> 01:30:46,970
Yeah. No more of that

777
01:30:47,175 --> 01:30:49,769
Weakling! You're a worm

778
01:30:50,011 --> 01:30:52,206
Yeah. I'm a worm

779
01:32:10,191 --> 01:32:11,419
6 - 6

780
01:32:18,533 --> 01:32:22,367
No such combination in this race

781
01:32:24,939 --> 01:32:26,804
Give me 6 - 6

782
01:32:27,842 --> 01:32:29,332
6 - 6

783
01:32:31,145 --> 01:32:32,737
6 - 6

784
01:32:36,484 --> 01:32:39,112
Ass! What are you saying?

785
01:32:43,457 --> 01:32:45,652
Your money!

786
01:33:37,878 --> 01:33:40,938
How's the shop?

787
01:33:42,483 --> 01:33:44,144
The worst

788
01:33:44,385 --> 01:33:46,945
Then close it for a while

789
01:33:49,690 --> 01:33:53,820
I'll go home and stay there

790
01:33:54,495 --> 01:33:57,487
My father's ill

791
01:33:59,634 --> 01:34:01,898
Why don't you come with me?

792
01:34:03,004 --> 01:34:04,301
With you?

793
01:34:09,777 --> 01:34:11,938
No one else there

794
01:34:29,463 --> 01:34:32,227
Having a good time?

795
01:34:32,633 --> 01:34:35,363
You look well off. Buy a rock

796
01:34:36,737 --> 01:34:39,535
One for a weight

797
01:34:39,907 --> 01:34:42,034
To hold her down

798
01:34:42,476 --> 01:34:43,807
Some pimp!

799
01:34:44,345 --> 01:34:45,607
Pimp?

800
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:48,947
Hey, hurry!

801
01:34:49,984 --> 01:34:51,781
Hurry!

802
01:34:52,787 --> 01:34:54,448
What's keeping you?

803
01:34:59,827 --> 01:35:02,523
Let me use the pants

804
01:35:04,131 --> 01:35:05,894
Is it still here?

805
01:35:23,951 --> 01:35:26,579
100 yen for one

806
01:35:26,887 --> 01:35:28,115
100 yen

807
01:35:28,355 --> 01:35:32,416
Don't do that. You're going too far

808
01:35:32,893 --> 01:35:34,258
Looks like fun

809
01:35:35,896 --> 01:35:37,830
I'll ask him

810
01:35:38,032 --> 01:35:39,431
Knock it off!

811
01:35:40,167 --> 01:35:43,500
Sorry, I'm the first

812
01:35:48,542 --> 01:35:51,477
100 yen for one!

813
01:35:55,316 --> 01:35:56,613
Carry me

814
01:35:57,818 --> 01:35:58,785
Sure

815
01:36:14,301 --> 01:36:17,236
Life in the mountains...

816
01:36:17,838 --> 01:36:20,568
If you like it...

817
01:36:21,142 --> 01:36:23,667
you can stay with me as long as you like

818
01:36:23,811 --> 01:36:28,714
Let's go together

819
01:36:40,327 --> 01:36:50,066
Let's go

822
01:38:37,678 --> 01:38:39,669
Pay me 100 yen

823
01:38:58,565 --> 01:39:00,157
Thank you very much

824
01:39:17,718 --> 01:39:29,459
100 yen for one

825
01:39:29,997 --> 01:39:31,362
Ass!

826
01:39:56,724 --> 01:40:00,091
Hey, mister!

827
01:40:00,294 --> 01:40:02,319
Snap it up!

828
01:40:12,573 --> 01:40:14,006
I'm back

829
01:40:21,682 --> 01:40:23,411
What's wrong?

830
01:40:28,622 --> 01:40:30,647
Been to the river?

831
01:40:35,029 --> 01:40:37,293
About Dad?

832
01:40:38,198 --> 01:40:39,756
Did he look awful?

833
01:40:39,933 --> 01:40:41,093
Yeah

834
01:40:42,569 --> 01:40:44,127
That awful?

835
01:40:44,304 --> 01:40:45,362
Worse

836
01:40:47,374 --> 01:40:48,807
You hate him?

837
01:40:48,942 --> 01:40:50,170
Yeah

838
01:41:15,803 --> 01:41:19,136
Did he refuse the mahjong story too?

839
01:41:19,339 --> 01:41:23,469
The desk told me to try to persuade him

840
01:41:23,677 --> 01:41:26,737
You refused that one?

841
01:41:27,181 --> 01:41:30,446
That one? Yes

842
01:41:32,820 --> 01:41:36,119
It's too gloomy

843
01:41:36,323 --> 01:41:38,154
I don't dislike it

844
01:41:38,425 --> 01:41:43,453
But the readers want something lighter

845
01:41:43,730 --> 01:41:47,131
Please don't meet my husband

846
01:41:47,434 --> 01:41:52,303
He's suffering. Please let him alone

847
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:55,199
If he makes it...

848
01:41:55,409 --> 01:42:00,176
we'll publish his old comics again

849
01:42:01,115 --> 01:42:05,449
I'm sorry. I'm fixing supper
as a series

850
01:42:10,491 --> 01:42:12,584
See you again, sonny

851
01:42:22,936 --> 01:42:25,700
Goodbye

I came for you

856

You smell like the river

857
01:43:47,688 --> 01:43:48,620
You hate it?

858
01:43:48,755 --> 01:43:49,881
Yeah

859
