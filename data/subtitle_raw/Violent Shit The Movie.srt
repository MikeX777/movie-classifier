1
00:00:34,521 --> 00:00:35,521
Why did you take so long?

2
00:00:35,841 --> 00:00:37,241
I was playing in the woods.

3
00:00:38,081 --> 00:00:39,161
Come here.

4
00:00:40,721 --> 00:00:43,681
Look how dirty you are.
I'm tired and sick of you.

5
00:00:44,441 --> 00:00:46,881
Go straight to your room.
No supper for you.

6
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:49,041
No, mummy, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:49,601 --> 00:00:51,921
Go to your room.
I don't want to see you again.

8
00:00:52,081 --> 00:00:52,601
Go to hell.

9
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,281
You're as stupid and stubborn
<i>as</i> that pig of your father.

10
00:00:57,441 --> 00:01:01,281
Stop crying
or you'll be in big trouble.

11
00:01:05,561 --> 00:01:07,041
No, mummy, please...

12
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:08,001
Mummy...

13
00:01:08,441 --> 00:01:09,641
Please, open the door...

14
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:12,641
Let me out...
Don't leave me in the dark.

15
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,201
I'm scared.

16
00:01:15,921 --> 00:01:17,481
Open the door...

17
00:01:18,841 --> 00:01:20,961
Please mummy,
I'm sorry...

18
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:27,121
<i>Don't cry...</i>

19
00:01:27,281 --> 00:01:28,841
<i>don't be afraid.</i>

20
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:30,681
<i>I'm your friend.</i>

21
00:01:31,361 --> 00:01:33,081
<i>Don't worry.</i>

22
00:01:33,241 --> 00:01:34,641
<i>I'll let you out of here.</i>

23
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:37,001
<i>You are a good boy.</i>

24
00:01:37,161 --> 00:01:40,161
<i>Don't believe</i> a <i>word
what your mother tells you.</i>

25
00:01:41,361 --> 00:01:44,961
<i>Take this
and you will become invincible.</i>

26
00:01:45,641 --> 00:01:48,401
<i>No-one will hurt you any more.</i>

27
00:01:58,641 --> 00:01:59,141
Karl?

28
00:01:59,721 --> 00:02:02,001
Karl?
Who's in there?

29
00:02:21,921 --> 00:02:23,241
What's going on?

30
00:02:23,401 --> 00:02:24,681
What's that mask?

31
00:05:38,721 --> 00:05:40,561
<i>All is lost now!</i>

32
00:05:41,681 --> 00:05:44,041
<i>I just need to get out of here.</i>

33
00:05:44,961 --> 00:05:47,841
<i>Without knowledge
we will be free from the Darkness</i>

34
00:05:48,521 --> 00:05:51,841
<i>and once we understand it,
it may be too late.</i>

35
00:05:52,801 --> 00:05:55,481
<i>All my researches have been in vain.</i>

36
00:05:56,961 --> 00:05:58,841
<i>He is too mighty now!</i>

37
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:02,321
<i>His Legions are nested everywhere.</i>

38
00:06:04,081 --> 00:06:06,801
<i>But I know his darkest secrets.</i>

39
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:09,281
<i>The seal is the key!</i>

40
00:06:09,721 --> 00:06:13,041
<i>The Salamander viewer knows
the world of shadows</i>

41
00:06:13,201 --> 00:06:16,641
<i>and the twelfth crescent moon
has already opened the gate.</i>

42
00:06:17,641 --> 00:06:21,881
<i>The fourteenth night prepares,
and nothing can stop him.</i>

43
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:23,161
<i>Oh!</i>

44
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:24,801
<i>They're here!</i>

45
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:28,521
<i>The Prince of Light is back
from the Darkness.</i>

46
00:06:28,841 --> 00:06:31,881
<i>And his messengers scrutinize from above.</i>

47
00:06:48,521 --> 00:06:49,841
<i>There they are...</i>

48
00:06:50,481 --> 00:06:51,841
<i>Cursed!</i>

49
00:06:52,361 --> 00:06:53,961
<i>They are coming to take me,</i>

50
00:06:54,121 --> 00:06:55,321
<i>but they will not have...</i>

51
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:56,561
<i>my soul.</i>

52
00:07:25,401 --> 00:07:27,361
<i>I knew this day would come.</i>

53
00:07:27,521 --> 00:07:31,521
<i>The Antichrist rules the world
and evil is without a face.</i>

54
00:07:35,401 --> 00:07:36,321
<i>He is here!</i>

55
00:07:36,721 --> 00:07:38,601
<i>I can feel his presence.</i>

56
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:48,921
<i>He is everywhere,</i>

57
00:07:49,081 --> 00:07:52,121
<i>he has the gift of all-presence
and mutation.</i>

58
00:07:52,281 --> 00:07:56,321
<i>He can transform at will,
make himself visible or invisible.</i>

59
00:07:56,481 --> 00:07:59,601
<i>One who evokes his power,
will have great privileges.</i>

60
00:07:59,921 --> 00:08:03,561
<i>But he will be subjugated to his will,
as a puppet in his hands.</i>

61
00:08:03,961 --> 00:08:05,881
<i>History has known dark ages,</i>

62
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,841
<i>dominated by his servants,</i>

63
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:09,601
<i>violent and barbaric.</i>

64
00:08:09,761 --> 00:08:12,641
<i>But now, we are truly at the end of time.</i>

65
00:08:13,321 --> 00:08:16,801
<i>The era of violence
and blood has already begun.</i>

66
00:09:51,081 --> 00:09:55,361
They say the wicked always end up
with the wicked.

67
00:09:55,521 --> 00:10:00,041
We both know where we are from,
and where we are heading.

68
00:10:00,921 --> 00:10:04,401
We have made a pact, and must honour it.

69
00:10:04,881 --> 00:10:06,361
That's fair.

70
00:10:12,161 --> 00:10:12,841
No!

71
00:10:13,481 --> 00:10:15,361
Nothing's going to stop me!

72
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,081
I am different from the others,

73
00:10:18,801 --> 00:10:21,361
I'm not interested in cash

74
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:25,281
money is simply a means to get to the top,

75
00:10:26,681 --> 00:10:28,201
to the real power.

76
00:10:28,641 --> 00:10:32,641
That's the only reason
I went into politics.

77
00:10:33,561 --> 00:10:34,361
My enemies

78
00:10:35,361 --> 00:10:39,761
are the same people
that pretend to be on my side,

79
00:10:40,361 --> 00:10:42,761
not the newspapers and televisions.

80
00:10:43,281 --> 00:10:47,641
They are sabotaging my electoral campaign,

81
00:10:48,001 --> 00:10:49,721
and I'm asking you...

82
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:53,081
to deal with this problem!

83
00:10:58,641 --> 00:11:01,521
I've made my choice in this world,

84
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:07,641
and you promised me you would help me
to finalize my work.

85
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:11,521
I am not afraid of you.

86
00:11:12,161 --> 00:11:14,321
I am not afraid of you.

87
00:11:41,681 --> 00:11:43,281
I'm here, I told you...

88
00:11:44,201 --> 00:11:45,681
yes, yes.

89
00:11:46,361 --> 00:11:49,241
We're waiting for the forensics to arrive
and do the examination.

90
00:11:49,961 --> 00:11:51,561
Yeah, no one's moving...

91
00:11:52,321 --> 00:11:54,401
yeah, and the photographs, yes... yes,

92
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,241
is this conversation really necessary?

93
00:11:58,681 --> 00:12:01,001
Listen, I have guests here,

94
00:12:01,401 --> 00:12:04,361
so <i>I'll</i> let you do your job.
Speak to you later.

95
00:12:06,081 --> 00:12:08,121
Beginners in the Operations Room:

96
00:12:08,281 --> 00:12:11,161
a couple of years sitting behind the desk,
and...

97
00:12:11,961 --> 00:12:13,401
when you get cases like these

98
00:12:13,561 --> 00:12:17,161
they are more anxious than a mother
on her son's first day at school.

99
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:19,121
All we have to do now

100
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:21,441
is to keep the people away
from the marked-off area

101
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,081
and just stay here on the spot,

102
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,881
with a little bit of breakfast
in our stomachs.

103
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,241
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

104
00:12:27,401 --> 00:12:29,761
Hans Ebert, Interpol, Hamburg office.

105
00:12:29,921 --> 00:12:30,881
We've met before.

106
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,161
I've been with the flying squad
for a couple of weeks.

107
00:12:33,361 --> 00:12:35,281
Yeah yeah, I remember, I remember:

108
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,561
you're on somebody's trail.

109
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:41,281
Well, here we have no crime weapon,

110
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:46,081
we have no hands to bag to preserve traces
of contact with the attacker.

111
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,921
We have nothing, it seems, for the moment.

112
00:12:49,081 --> 00:12:51,121
You're right, “for the time being”.

113
00:12:52,081 --> 00:12:54,681
So then... let me guess:
no limbs have been found.

114
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:57,241
Are there any witnesses?
Who found the body?

115
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,761
No limbs, no head.

116
00:12:59,601 --> 00:13:02,321
If you consider the point
where the body was found,

117
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:03,921
if it hadn't been for the smell

118
00:13:04,921 --> 00:13:05,881
and the blood,

119
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:09,481
a passer-by might have easily thought
it was just a pile of clothes.

120
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,641
And I'm not exaggerating.

121
00:13:19,441 --> 00:13:22,841
The body was found by the owner
of that house over there.

122
00:13:23,001 --> 00:13:24,362
He is with two officers right now,

123
00:13:24,921 --> 00:13:28,001
and I really doubt he's strong enough
to go anywhere.

124
00:13:29,321 --> 00:13:30,201
Mauro!

125
00:13:31,201 --> 00:13:33,481
Please, take a look at this short report.

126
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,281
The papers were left on the corpse.

127
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:41,281
The position of the blood stains indicates
that the victim was murdered on the spot,

128
00:13:41,441 --> 00:13:42,881
after a brief struggle.

129
00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:46,561
Given the lack of tracks close
to the scene of the crime,

130
00:13:46,721 --> 00:13:49,761
the removed limbs were probably carried
somewhere else in containers.

131
00:13:52,361 --> 00:13:53,481
Any tyre marks?

132
00:13:53,961 --> 00:13:54,721
Yes.

133
00:13:55,641 --> 00:13:56,681
Yes, they're over there,

134
00:13:57,561 --> 00:13:58,481
near the gate.

135
00:13:58,641 --> 00:13:59,801
They don't look recent,

136
00:13:59,961 --> 00:14:02,801
but the forensic guys will see
if they're of any use.

137
00:14:02,961 --> 00:14:07,241
Good. Let's have a look around while
we wait for the forensic examination.

138
00:14:08,441 --> 00:14:10,361
We might try and connect

139
00:14:10,521 --> 00:14:15,081
this mornings situation with the case
of two months ago, and the one of last week.

140
00:14:16,681 --> 00:14:20,241
I would say that there is a good chance
the killer is one and the same.

141
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:25,521
Yeah yeah, we all naturally thought about the
murder of the girl in Lungotevere di San Paolo.

142
00:14:25,681 --> 00:14:28,041
Maybe that's why they brought
you here to Italy.

143
00:14:29,441 --> 00:14:33,841
As you said, I am on someone's trail,
something to do with esoterism.

144
00:14:34,121 --> 00:14:35,761
Yeah. So...

145
00:14:35,921 --> 00:14:38,721
I'm sure you will have read all
the reports on the previous cases.

146
00:14:38,881 --> 00:14:41,921
So let's not waste any time,
please tell me what you think about it.

147
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:44,281
Well, the type of victim is different:

148
00:14:44,441 --> 00:14:46,081
it may indicate a random contact.

149
00:14:46,241 --> 00:14:49,201
I have reason to believe that
the perpetrator is working on his own.

150
00:14:49,361 --> 00:14:51,081
The bodies have not been hidden,

151
00:14:51,241 --> 00:14:54,321
in this case even
the documents have been left here.

152
00:14:56,081 --> 00:14:57,721
The removal of the limbs

153
00:14:58,161 --> 00:14:59,761
points to a ritual murder.

154
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:01,481
I have reason to believe,

155
00:15:02,521 --> 00:15:04,601
and I am saying this to you in confidence,

156
00:15:05,441 --> 00:15:08,721
that there may be links
with serial killings in Germany

157
00:15:08,881 --> 00:15:10,441
in the 1980s,

158
00:15:10,921 --> 00:15:12,801
attributed to Karl the Butcher.

159
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,361
The Butcher of Hamburg?

160
00:15:14,521 --> 00:15:15,841
Christ, I remember that period.

161
00:15:16,201 --> 00:15:20,041
Over here we were working
with two magnifying glasses and a carrier bag.

162
00:15:20,681 --> 00:15:24,961
And do you think in Hamburg that he might
have returned after such a long time?

163
00:15:25,161 --> 00:15:27,081
It can not be a copycat?

164
00:15:27,241 --> 00:15:31,241
We cannot rule out anything with certainty,
but I doubt it is an imitator.

165
00:15:32,401 --> 00:15:33,201
You're not joking!

166
00:15:33,361 --> 00:15:35,801
You've just brought Karl the Butcher
into the picture!

167
00:15:35,961 --> 00:15:37,881
How can you be so sure?

168
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:40,641
Rome may not have all the bridges
that you've got,

169
00:15:41,321 --> 00:15:44,161
but it's still got its own shit running
through the city:

170
00:15:44,321 --> 00:15:48,001
an obsessive maybe,
another sadist nihilist.

171
00:15:48,161 --> 00:15:50,361
As I was saying, my leads...

172
00:15:51,001 --> 00:15:53,361
Yeah, go ahead, I'm sorry.
I was listening.

173
00:15:54,361 --> 00:15:56,361
Only I'm just not convinced.

174
00:15:56,521 --> 00:15:59,721
I really hate mornings
when so many things happen.

175
00:16:00,401 --> 00:16:03,441
After the last murder
we had little to go on.

176
00:16:03,601 --> 00:16:05,961
Then, that little turned into nothing.

177
00:16:06,121 --> 00:16:08,201
No one managed to build a valid profile:

178
00:16:08,481 --> 00:16:11,481
movements, links with victims,
the motives.

179
00:16:11,881 --> 00:16:14,121
The brutality of the murders
was the only constant,

180
00:16:14,281 --> 00:16:16,361
yet the method used was different.

181
00:16:16,801 --> 00:16:20,681
We didn't find any murder weapon,
nor physical traces of the murderer.

182
00:16:21,321 --> 00:16:23,481
I wasn't involved directly at the time,

183
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:28,361
but I studied the case quite a bit,
and I know the persons who worked on it:

184
00:16:28,841 --> 00:16:30,881
I am still in touch with them.

185
00:16:31,401 --> 00:16:35,161
Did you ever manage to figure out
why the murders suddenly stopped?

186
00:16:35,321 --> 00:16:37,921
And how can you be sure
that Karl is still alive?

187
00:16:38,401 --> 00:16:40,001
I cannot explain that to you,

188
00:16:41,241 --> 00:16:44,601
but we have always felt that one day
he might be back.

189
00:16:45,121 --> 00:16:49,041
I also have some materials that you need
to see in order to follow my theories.

190
00:16:49,601 --> 00:16:53,041
Part of the investigation done
by one of my contacts in Hamburg.

191
00:16:53,401 --> 00:16:55,881
I understand that you may think it crazy

192
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,121
and maybe a waste of energy,

193
00:16:58,281 --> 00:17:02,481
but I need someone like you that is
able to move around this city.

194
00:17:02,641 --> 00:17:06,481
And I don't think that you have
made progress in any real direction.

195
00:17:07,441 --> 00:17:08,601
Mmh. You're right about that,

196
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:12,241
but I don't think three murders are enough
to follow that type of trail.

197
00:17:12,401 --> 00:17:15,921
We will soon find ourselves in the same
situation that you were in Germany.

198
00:17:16,561 --> 00:17:19,281
Hans, I will let my team
take over at the scene.

199
00:17:19,441 --> 00:17:21,721
You and I will take this further,
I want to know more.

200
00:17:21,881 --> 00:17:25,001
However, I don't think we have any choice.
So I will help you.

201
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:31,121
This is where we found the body.
Down there. No head, no arms, no legs...

202
00:17:31,681 --> 00:17:33,001
Just like last time.

203
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:37,881
Good God, just what we needed.
Castellari is down there.

204
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,961
Yeah, Cozzi is here too,

205
00:17:40,121 --> 00:17:42,801
he will be here to oversee
the forensic report.

206
00:17:43,081 --> 00:17:46,961
Seeing someone cut into pieces early
in the morning will surely make his day,

207
00:17:47,121 --> 00:17:48,281
I'm telling you.

208
00:17:48,441 --> 00:17:49,561
Oh, look...

209
00:17:49,841 --> 00:17:51,202
<i>I'm just trying to do my job here.</i>

210
00:17:52,721 --> 00:17:53,801
D'Amato,

211
00:17:53,961 --> 00:17:55,361
what a surprise to see you here!

212
00:17:55,521 --> 00:17:58,041
What a nice coincidence...
I love coincidences.

213
00:17:58,921 --> 00:18:03,081
So, you were passing around here,
and you saw the body down there

214
00:18:03,241 --> 00:18:04,241
or maybe...

215
00:18:04,521 --> 00:18:05,921
you are on duty?

216
00:18:06,361 --> 00:18:09,641
The inspector was one of the first
to reach the crime scene.

217
00:18:09,801 --> 00:18:11,561
He's been here since the report came in.

218
00:18:11,721 --> 00:18:12,681
Forget about it, Hans...

219
00:18:13,921 --> 00:18:15,961
Oh, our dear esteemed German colleague,

220
00:18:16,441 --> 00:18:17,601
Fritz Herbert.

221
00:18:18,001 --> 00:18:20,841
I see you two are getting on very well?

222
00:18:21,681 --> 00:18:23,321
There's a spark between you!

223
00:18:24,321 --> 00:18:24,841
Hans,

224
00:18:25,401 --> 00:18:26,521
the name is Hans.

225
00:18:26,841 --> 00:18:27,441
Hans...

226
00:18:28,121 --> 00:18:28,961
I prefer Fritz.

227
00:18:29,121 --> 00:18:29,641
Anyway-

228
00:18:29,961 --> 00:18:31,921
Hans, tell me,

229
00:18:32,081 --> 00:18:35,681
has your “investigative activity”
been successful,

230
00:18:35,841 --> 00:18:40,561
as one would expect
from two “hounds” like you?

231
00:18:40,841 --> 00:18:42,961
We have nothing significant to report.

232
00:18:43,401 --> 00:18:46,961
Yeah, “without the will to scrutinise,
the eye will not see”, eh?

233
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,361
Wise words,

234
00:18:49,521 --> 00:18:51,281
Very wise words, Doctor Cozzi.

235
00:18:51,561 --> 00:18:52,601
Very wise...

236
00:18:53,241 --> 00:18:56,481
You know, dear colleagues,
normally it would be better

237
00:18:56,841 --> 00:19:00,601
to keep two bad police officers
AWAY from a crime scene,

238
00:19:01,281 --> 00:19:05,281
so there is no risk of any contamination,
proof contamination.

239
00:19:06,121 --> 00:19:08,041
But with you, there is nothing,

240
00:19:08,201 --> 00:19:11,841
no such risk,
because you are not doing anything here,

241
00:19:12,001 --> 00:19:15,201
you're absolutely useless,
in every circumstance!

242
00:19:17,561 --> 00:19:18,481
Gentlemen,

243
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,521
today I am coordinating operations:

244
00:19:21,841 --> 00:19:25,361
I can't even imagine
what all those idiots would do

245
00:19:25,521 --> 00:19:28,041
if one of you two were in charge!

246
00:19:29,161 --> 00:19:31,681
I don't know what I'm still doing here,
at my age,

247
00:19:33,561 --> 00:19:35,681
doing other people's work!

248
00:19:38,961 --> 00:19:40,761
As fine investigators,

249
00:19:40,921 --> 00:19:44,561
capable only of wandering around the city
without a clear idea in your brain,

250
00:19:44,721 --> 00:19:49,081
let's concentrate
on searching for the killer!

251
00:19:50,001 --> 00:19:52,201
Or at least pretend to try!

252
00:19:52,361 --> 00:19:54,361
Try to remember a couple of things,

253
00:19:54,521 --> 00:19:57,761
two “insignificant” things,
two “insignificant” details:

254
00:19:58,001 --> 00:20:03,601
the first is that at night a pervert is
going around and slaughtering people,

255
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,761
and the second,

256
00:20:06,681 --> 00:20:11,041
this pervert is a brute
with a superhuman strength.

257
00:20:12,201 --> 00:20:14,841
Yes please,
let's see some action, at last!

258
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:17,161
Back in my days

259
00:20:17,321 --> 00:20:19,961
we didn't have all this technology,

260
00:20:20,121 --> 00:20:23,201
we just had to keep our eyes open
that's all.

261
00:20:23,481 --> 00:20:26,201
You bunch of amateurs!

262
00:20:26,681 --> 00:20:27,401
Come on Lewis...

263
00:20:28,081 --> 00:20:29,361
these fucking young people

264
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:31,361
don't know shit from psychology...

265
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:34,441
Ridiculous, doesn't he realise
he's talking nonsense?

266
00:20:35,281 --> 00:20:39,281
He talks <i>as</i> if we were working in
a town of a few hundred people.

267
00:20:39,441 --> 00:20:41,041
It's not the criminals,

268
00:20:41,201 --> 00:20:43,881
but people like him that
make you hate this job.

269
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:44,801
Yeah yeah,

270
00:20:44,961 --> 00:20:47,561
I learned to take no
notice over the years.

271
00:20:47,721 --> 00:20:50,081
And I never said I hate this job.

272
00:20:50,241 --> 00:20:52,081
But I... I don't love it either.

273
00:20:52,241 --> 00:20:54,921
Let us keep as far as possible
away from those two,

274
00:20:55,081 --> 00:20:56,881
and do our own investigations.

275
00:22:29,801 --> 00:22:30,801
Ah, dear!

276
00:22:33,441 --> 00:22:39,161
Come here, and put that
splendid gift on my desk!

277
00:22:41,721 --> 00:22:42,561
At last!

278
00:22:44,161 --> 00:22:45,361
At last!

279
00:23:00,961 --> 00:23:02,041
Perhaps

280
00:23:02,441 --> 00:23:05,641
you don't realise what
we have here today, my dear Liliana!

281
00:23:07,001 --> 00:23:09,801
Professor,
you've talked about this all the time

282
00:23:09,961 --> 00:23:11,801
in the last few days!

283
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:17,241
I imagine it will become
the showpiece of your collection.

284
00:23:18,561 --> 00:23:23,441
None of us, no one indeed,
can calculate its worth!

285
00:23:24,961 --> 00:23:26,481
Its power!

286
00:23:32,641 --> 00:23:35,401
More than 1,500 years ago

287
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:38,401
a man who came from nowhere,

288
00:23:38,561 --> 00:23:40,681
Attila the king of the Huns,

289
00:23:42,481 --> 00:23:44,761
managed to bring terror

290
00:23:45,401 --> 00:23:46,481
to the world!

291
00:23:48,681 --> 00:23:51,361
Historians of
the past have passed down to us

292
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:54,961
hundreds of legends about him,

293
00:23:56,201 --> 00:24:00,121
about the origin
of the strength of his terrifying army.

294
00:24:03,161 --> 00:24:04,281
The Huns

295
00:24:05,601 --> 00:24:07,001
came from the east,

296
00:24:08,201 --> 00:24:11,801
ransacking the villages
of their Germanic enemies,

297
00:24:12,561 --> 00:24:14,001
burning their land

298
00:24:15,201 --> 00:24:17,881
and devouring their women and children!

299
00:24:21,121 --> 00:24:24,761
Blood made him unstoppable

300
00:24:25,521 --> 00:24:26,921
on the battlefield.

301
00:24:28,401 --> 00:24:33,121
He brought Europe to its knees,
and for many years made

302
00:24:33,281 --> 00:24:34,801
the Roman Empire anxious

303
00:24:34,961 --> 00:24:38,201
and in fear of a terrifying invasion.

304
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:48,041
We will never know how
Attila came to obtain this gift.

305
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:52,001
Some say it was
in a village on the Danube,

306
00:24:52,401 --> 00:24:55,721
from witches celebrating
the Cult of the Flesh.

307
00:24:56,481 --> 00:24:58,361
Others that

308
00:25:00,361 --> 00:25:03,161
it came from
the helmet of Attila's brother,

309
00:25:04,601 --> 00:25:05,561
Bleda,

310
00:25:06,321 --> 00:25:10,721
who had died in mysterious circumstances
during the march westwards,

311
00:25:11,881 --> 00:25:16,881
and that Bleda's
spirit lived on in the metal

312
00:25:17,801 --> 00:25:19,961
it was forged with.

313
00:25:20,961 --> 00:25:22,121
Spirit...

314
00:25:22,761 --> 00:25:27,081
do you think that the spirits
of both brothers could still be alive?

315
00:25:27,801 --> 00:25:31,201
How was it that their enemies
managed to stop them?

316
00:25:33,321 --> 00:25:34,721
Hehe, the light!

317
00:25:36,921 --> 00:25:37,921
Attila

318
00:25:38,641 --> 00:25:44,681
would have hesitated only when faced by
what was sacred for all peoples of the world.

319
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:50,801
It was Pope Leon I who paid a
visit to the King of the Huns,

320
00:25:51,441 --> 00:25:54,961
and it was he, who managed
to stop his march on Rome.

321
00:25:56,481 --> 00:26:02,961
So it was that Attila gave up his idea of
invading the capital of the Western Empire.

322
00:26:05,201 --> 00:26:10,001
A bloodthirsty warrior,
kept away from the battlefield,

323
00:26:11,121 --> 00:26:13,001
loses all his power,

324
00:26:15,401 --> 00:26:20,441
and it was the very blood
that kept him strong in war

325
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:26,001
that took his final breath:

326
00:26:27,281 --> 00:26:29,601
he died in his sleep,

327
00:26:30,561 --> 00:26:32,761
from a brain haemorrhage.

328
00:26:34,441 --> 00:26:35,721
...and now

329
00:26:35,881 --> 00:26:39,201
you have this power in your hands,
professor.

330
00:26:40,441 --> 00:26:42,281
My dear Liliana,

331
00:26:43,121 --> 00:26:48,041
I think it's time we start preparing

332
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:53,561
and send the invitations for our party.

333
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:57,961
Now that this object is here,

334
00:26:58,921 --> 00:27:00,921
it's time indeed

335
00:27:01,081 --> 00:27:03,161
to start getting ready.

336
00:27:04,521 --> 00:27:07,161
You'll take care of everything,
won't you dear?

337
00:27:13,361 --> 00:27:14,521
Attila

338
00:27:16,441 --> 00:27:18,601
had an army and a kingdom:

339
00:27:20,721 --> 00:27:24,201
but I don't want
all the blood in the world!

340
00:27:26,361 --> 00:27:27,881
I would be happy...

341
00:27:30,361 --> 00:27:32,801
with just a goblet full!

342
00:28:17,241 --> 00:28:18,161
Hi.

343
00:28:19,761 --> 00:28:21,161
I've just finished...

344
00:28:23,641 --> 00:28:25,401
I agree with you, my love.

345
00:28:25,801 --> 00:28:28,281
No, no, don't worry,

346
00:28:28,441 --> 00:28:29,961
I have the car.

347
00:28:30,601 --> 00:28:32,001
Yes, my love...

348
00:28:32,161 --> 00:28:34,081
But... where are you now?

349
00:28:35,121 --> 00:28:37,001
So <i>I'll</i> pick you up.

350
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,921
See you soon... kisses.

351
00:28:47,641 --> 00:28:50,321
I have to go, old man. Ciao.

352
00:29:22,601 --> 00:29:23,721
Hello.

353
00:29:26,401 --> 00:29:28,081
I was looking for you, my dear.

354
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:30,961
Of course.

355
00:29:34,081 --> 00:29:37,681
Well, there are always
dangers in such situations.

356
00:29:38,801 --> 00:29:39,761
This evening?

357
00:29:40,481 --> 00:29:41,641
I don't think so.

358
00:29:43,801 --> 00:29:45,801
Now I'm waiting for someone...

359
00:30:29,601 --> 00:30:31,001
a nightmare!

360
00:30:31,161 --> 00:30:33,121
I've never seen anything like that.

361
00:30:34,241 --> 00:30:35,721
Thank God I had a light lunch.

362
00:30:35,881 --> 00:30:38,161
But I really need to drink something.

363
00:30:44,281 --> 00:30:45,641
Here is some medicine.

364
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:48,321
Thank you.

365
00:30:48,921 --> 00:30:50,201
It's Scottish.

366
00:30:50,961 --> 00:30:52,721
Oh, I see. You treat yourself well.

367
00:30:52,881 --> 00:30:54,041
I don't drink.

368
00:30:54,201 --> 00:30:55,681
I keep it here for my guests.

369
00:30:56,401 --> 00:30:58,481
You don't strike me as someone
who has many guests.

370
00:30:58,841 --> 00:31:01,161
Actually I don't have so much room here...

371
00:31:01,321 --> 00:31:03,321
I still have to bring in my equipment.

372
00:31:03,801 --> 00:31:05,121
I have just moved in here.

373
00:31:07,321 --> 00:31:09,001
Where did you get that video?

374
00:31:09,361 --> 00:31:10,961
Was it found on a crime scene?

375
00:31:11,121 --> 00:31:12,881
Or maybe you smuggled it out?

376
00:31:13,641 --> 00:31:18,401
These scenes are not to be shown to anyone.
Do not talk to anyone about it,

377
00:31:19,001 --> 00:31:20,041
it's too dangerous.

378
00:31:20,761 --> 00:31:22,561
Who do I have to talk to, huh?

379
00:31:24,121 --> 00:31:26,121
Those idiots in the flying squad?

380
00:31:27,121 --> 00:31:32,081
I received this information from a file
in a parcel sent to me anonymously.

381
00:31:33,361 --> 00:31:34,361
And I also...

382
00:31:34,921 --> 00:31:37,281
received this...

383
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:40,601
inscription.

384
00:31:44,721 --> 00:31:46,521
Is it a puzzle?

385
00:31:48,001 --> 00:31:49,761
Do we have to call in the decoders?

386
00:31:49,921 --> 00:31:51,761
I don't think that is necessary.

387
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:54,281
The Sator Square is a palindrome,

388
00:31:55,281 --> 00:31:58,321
a phrase that you read forward
the same as you read backwards.

389
00:31:58,681 --> 00:32:00,441
Have you ever heard of the magic square?

390
00:32:00,721 --> 00:32:03,921
No, I did technical studies at school, so...

391
00:32:04,081 --> 00:32:08,841
A magic square is a popular Latin
inscription found during archaeological digs.

392
00:32:09,201 --> 00:32:11,121
One of these, the SATOR,

393
00:32:11,281 --> 00:32:14,601
was found in Rome
in the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore.

394
00:32:15,001 --> 00:32:19,201
Are you saying that this SATOR
has something to do with Satanism?

395
00:32:19,361 --> 00:32:24,081
If my theory is correct, it is something
more complex and terrifying.

396
00:32:24,241 --> 00:32:27,521
One of the possible anagrams of
SATOR is this interesting one:

397
00:32:32,001 --> 00:32:36,161
As I said, I did technical studies at school,
so can you translate this please?

398
00:32:37,081 --> 00:32:39,801
SATAN, I PRAY TO YOU AND
CONFIDE IN YOUR CUNNING.

399
00:32:40,801 --> 00:32:42,801
I'm sorry Ebert, I don't get it.

400
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,121
What the hell does KTB
have to do with Sator?

401
00:32:45,281 --> 00:32:47,361
As I said, it's only a theory,

402
00:32:47,521 --> 00:32:48,361
but at first,

403
00:32:48,521 --> 00:32:49,921
what we need to do,
is to go to Rome

404
00:32:49,961 --> 00:32:53,521
and find this antiques dealer
who is an expert on esoterism.

405
00:32:54,801 --> 00:32:56,041
Ok, so <i>I'll</i> call the station

406
00:32:56,201 --> 00:32:59,721
and <i>I'll</i> get a couple of men to draw
up a list of the major antiquarians in Rome,

407
00:32:59,881 --> 00:33:02,361
specializing in esoterism.

408
00:33:02,521 --> 00:33:05,881
Excellent. I will call my colleague in
Hamburg to get some more information.

409
00:33:06,041 --> 00:33:06,681
Ok.

410
00:33:13,361 --> 00:33:14,281
Hello?

411
00:33:14,601 --> 00:33:15,481
Hi, it's me. Hans.

412
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:17,161
Hello Hans.
How's it going?

413
00:33:17,321 --> 00:33:17,921
All is Well...

414
00:33:18,281 --> 00:33:21,121
I bet you're having
a great vacation in Italy?

415
00:33:21,281 --> 00:33:21,961
<i>Good weather and all...</i>

416
00:33:22,121 --> 00:33:24,001
but people die just the same.

417
00:33:24,401 --> 00:33:26,401
<i>Listen, Paul.
Karl the Butcher is here.</i>

418
00:33:26,561 --> 00:33:27,922
Send me all
the relevant documents.

419
00:33:28,481 --> 00:33:29,641
All right. Will do.

420
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:33,001
I'll send you all the information,
all I have. No problem.

421
00:33:33,161 --> 00:33:34,681
Thanks. Yes, alright...

422
00:33:35,161 --> 00:33:36,521
But remember...

423
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:37,801
Don't wake the dead!

424
00:33:37,961 --> 00:33:38,521
Ciao.

425
00:33:48,121 --> 00:33:49,401
What are you looking at?

426
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:50,481
Asshole!

427
00:34:02,761 --> 00:34:05,441
Look Mina, I told you I would
be home in time for lunch.

428
00:34:05,601 --> 00:34:09,001
I'd love to be home in time for lunch,
but I'm not able to get home in time for lunch.

429
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:13,321
You can't be always breaking my balls,
every time I'm on the phone with you...

430
00:34:58,121 --> 00:34:59,881
- Do you like it?
- I'm sorry?

431
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:02,001
I asked if you like this dress.

432
00:35:02,441 --> 00:35:04,081
I would like to make you happy.

433
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:06,801
I've seen you walking down the street,

434
00:35:06,961 --> 00:35:08,921
I was thinking of giving you a gift.

435
00:35:09,601 --> 00:35:12,441
You are so elegant and so pretty.

436
00:35:13,841 --> 00:35:15,721
You are very kind,

437
00:35:15,881 --> 00:35:17,601
but please do not go to any trouble...

438
00:35:18,401 --> 00:35:19,641
Don't be afraid of me.

439
00:35:20,361 --> 00:35:23,201
I'm not a stranger offering sweets:

440
00:35:23,361 --> 00:35:25,761
it's just a gift from me to you.

441
00:35:27,081 --> 00:35:29,081
Your compliments are kind enough.

442
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:31,201
There's really no need.

443
00:35:31,841 --> 00:35:34,081
Oh, you think I'm a nasty person?

444
00:35:34,561 --> 00:35:36,081
Tell me what you think:

445
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:38,321
if you don't trust me,

446
00:35:38,641 --> 00:35:40,321
I will just go away.

447
00:35:40,641 --> 00:35:44,321
I will go, but with a broken heart!

448
00:35:59,361 --> 00:36:00,481
Don't scream!

449
00:36:00,641 --> 00:36:01,961
- It's useless!
- Let me go...

450
00:36:03,401 --> 00:36:04,761
Don't cry bitch!

451
00:36:04,921 --> 00:36:06,121
I'm no you like it.

452
00:36:09,881 --> 00:36:10,881
Don't scream...

453
00:36:12,721 --> 00:36:14,481
No-one will save you.

454
00:36:26,561 --> 00:36:27,801
Yes? Any news?

455
00:36:27,961 --> 00:36:29,761
Wait a second, let me get a pen.

456
00:36:34,921 --> 00:36:35,721
Yeah“_...

457
00:36:37,841 --> 00:36:38,561
thank you..

458
00:36:40,001 --> 00:36:41,121
So we have something?

459
00:36:41,281 --> 00:36:44,921
Here's a list of the main antique dealers
in Rome specializing in esoterism.

460
00:36:45,081 --> 00:36:46,561
And one of them stands out:

461
00:36:47,361 --> 00:36:48,561
Sigismondo Fulci.

462
00:36:48,721 --> 00:36:49,641
Why is that?

463
00:36:49,801 --> 00:36:53,201
Well, I don't know Latin,
but I know Rome like the back of my hand.

464
00:36:53,361 --> 00:36:54,921
Guess where this Fulci shop is?

465
00:36:55,601 --> 00:36:57,801
- I don't know...
- Right next to Santa Maria Maggiore.

466
00:36:58,241 --> 00:36:59,881
Well okay then,

467
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:01,961
come on let's go,
there's no time to lose.

468
00:37:31,001 --> 00:37:32,401
Holy shit... oh fuck...

469
00:37:38,441 --> 00:37:40,041
Someone got here first.

470
00:37:44,481 --> 00:37:46,401
The room must have been
wrecked during the fight,

471
00:37:46,521 --> 00:37:48,961
but not by someone looking for something.

472
00:37:49,641 --> 00:37:51,681
We may still find something though.

473
00:37:51,841 --> 00:37:53,281
You call this a fight.

474
00:38:06,081 --> 00:38:06,881
Eben,

475
00:38:07,761 --> 00:38:08,801
look here!

476
00:38:09,041 --> 00:38:11,161
The last transaction on this list is with

477
00:38:11,321 --> 00:38:12,721
a Professor Vassago!

478
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:13,761
KTB.

479
00:38:14,681 --> 00:38:17,881
This is the place, let's go and hear
what the person living there has to say.

480
00:38:18,401 --> 00:38:21,041
What we have to do, D'Amato,
is try not to be aggressive,

481
00:38:21,201 --> 00:38:22,881
but get him to give the game away.

482
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:24,921
Perhaps we will find
the answer to our riddle.

483
00:38:25,081 --> 00:38:25,801
Yeah.

484
00:38:29,801 --> 00:38:31,561
Wait,
let's shut the door here:

485
00:38:31,881 --> 00:38:34,801
if someone discovers the corpse,
we'll be busy all day.

486
00:38:34,961 --> 00:38:36,761
We'll deal with this mess later.

487
00:39:03,201 --> 00:39:07,001
Did you hear about that poor woman that
was killed and dismembered? Fucking shit!

488
00:39:07,761 --> 00:39:09,961
Yes,
and I'm so scared...

489
00:39:11,201 --> 00:39:14,081
They say,
there is a serial killer going around...

490
00:39:14,241 --> 00:39:17,401
Oh my God,
I'm just so scared about this maniac...

491
00:39:18,561 --> 00:39:20,241
But we still need to work anyway.

492
00:39:20,401 --> 00:39:23,241
We just need to keep a watch
out and hope for the best...

493
00:39:43,961 --> 00:39:45,401
Have you seen Catherine?

494
00:39:45,961 --> 00:39:48,681
She is still playing with a customer.

495
00:39:49,481 --> 00:39:50,641
Yeah, thank you.

496
00:40:05,401 --> 00:40:06,361
Hi.

497
00:40:07,281 --> 00:40:09,001
There you are... at last!

498
00:40:11,801 --> 00:40:14,321
You know, how much
I miss those sweet lips.

499
00:40:20,521 --> 00:40:22,001
Thanks, you're so sweet.

500
00:40:24,481 --> 00:40:26,601
I'm always thinking of you,
you know.

501
00:40:30,441 --> 00:40:31,241
Come here.

502
00:41:09,881 --> 00:41:13,361
So... do you still want to marry me anyway,
my darling?

503
00:41:13,841 --> 00:41:15,521
Sure... I love you!

504
00:41:20,361 --> 00:41:21,361
And then?

505
00:41:22,361 --> 00:41:25,561
And what will people say
when they know

506
00:41:25,721 --> 00:41:28,041
that you married a bitch?

507
00:41:29,161 --> 00:41:31,641
I really don't care:

508
00:41:31,801 --> 00:41:33,441
maybe I want a bitch!

509
00:41:34,401 --> 00:41:35,641
Oh, what a gentleman!

510
00:41:36,441 --> 00:41:38,241
- I have to pee...
- Ok.

511
00:41:38,401 --> 00:41:39,881
<i>I'll</i> be right back:

512
00:41:40,281 --> 00:41:41,321
don't move.

513
00:41:41,601 --> 00:41:42,601
I won't.

514
00:42:32,881 --> 00:42:36,321
I believe the cops have
fallen into our trap:

515
00:42:36,961 --> 00:42:39,961
they've found the book with the addresses,
as scheduled.

516
00:42:40,481 --> 00:42:43,721
Everything is going according
to our plan.

517
00:42:56,121 --> 00:42:57,081
Professor Vassago,

518
00:42:57,841 --> 00:42:59,601
these two gentlemen from the police

519
00:43:00,441 --> 00:43:02,441
are here to speak with you.

520
00:43:03,121 --> 00:43:05,201
Officers,
I am professor Vassago.

521
00:43:05,361 --> 00:43:07,521
- Aristide D'Amato, police authorities.
- Hans Ebert.

522
00:43:07,921 --> 00:43:09,321
I bid you both welcome.

523
00:43:09,481 --> 00:43:11,481
- Would you like to sit down?
- Yes, please.

524
00:43:11,641 --> 00:43:15,001
Liliana, why don't you get something
to drink for these officers.

525
00:43:15,161 --> 00:43:16,561
Would you like a cup of tea?

526
00:43:17,401 --> 00:43:18,601
No thanks, we're ok.

527
00:43:18,921 --> 00:43:21,121
We hope not to bother you,
Professor Vassago.

528
00:43:21,281 --> 00:43:23,121
You have a wonderful house.

529
00:43:23,281 --> 00:43:24,961
I see that you collect antiques...

530
00:43:25,121 --> 00:43:26,921
Yes, it's my only job!

531
00:43:27,401 --> 00:43:31,201
You see, inside there I have maps, books

532
00:43:31,361 --> 00:43:35,201
and works of art that are
really rare and valuable!

533
00:43:35,801 --> 00:43:37,401
I am a collector

534
00:43:38,321 --> 00:43:39,441
and an active cataloguer,

535
00:43:39,601 --> 00:43:40,561
but first of all,

536
00:43:40,721 --> 00:43:42,681
I'm a lover of history.

537
00:43:42,841 --> 00:43:45,241
My colleague and I are making
investigations on some...

538
00:43:45,401 --> 00:43:47,921
illegal trafficking in materials

539
00:43:48,361 --> 00:43:50,121
and we would like to ask
you a few questions.

540
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:52,041
We need all the help we can get

541
00:43:52,201 --> 00:43:54,721
and you are very popular
amongst all the traders in the city.

542
00:43:55,441 --> 00:43:57,081
Illegal trafficking?

543
00:43:57,241 --> 00:43:59,641
Gentlemen,
you are offending my profession

544
00:43:59,801 --> 00:44:03,121
I do not trade in ivory
necklaces sold by poachers,

545
00:44:03,281 --> 00:44:06,121
if you're looking for this,
you should go to the antique markets.

546
00:44:06,281 --> 00:44:08,921
We respect your business,
but as I told you,

547
00:44:09,081 --> 00:44:11,161
we know that you meet
a lot of antiquarians

548
00:44:11,321 --> 00:44:13,961
and any additional informaton
can be useful at the moment.

549
00:44:14,121 --> 00:44:17,201
Oh yes I already had this problem,
in fact.

550
00:44:18,121 --> 00:44:19,401
But I wonder:

551
00:44:19,561 --> 00:44:23,081
why aren't the State forestry
corps dealing with that?

552
00:44:23,641 --> 00:44:25,601
The police have already
made investigations.

553
00:44:25,761 --> 00:44:28,161
There have been some complications.

554
00:44:28,681 --> 00:44:30,321
Nothing that we can talk about,
I'm sorry.

555
00:44:30,361 --> 00:44:33,161
I understand and accept your apologies,

556
00:44:33,321 --> 00:44:34,761
but... I'm sorry

557
00:44:34,921 --> 00:44:37,161
I just don't think I can help you.

558
00:44:38,401 --> 00:44:41,921
You see, I only work with honest traders

559
00:44:42,081 --> 00:44:46,121
and the ivory of my collections and the
one of the antiquarians I work with,

560
00:44:46,921 --> 00:44:48,521
is absolutely legal.

561
00:44:49,441 --> 00:44:52,001
- Vassago, I suppose you are
a lover of the codes. -Yeah.

562
00:44:52,161 --> 00:44:55,201
We found an inscription
bearing the symbol KTB,

563
00:44:55,961 --> 00:44:57,401
have you ever heard of it?

564
00:44:58,081 --> 00:45:01,281
KTB you say?

565
00:45:03,001 --> 00:45:05,361
Uhm,
it could be the Semitic root,

566
00:45:05,521 --> 00:45:08,681
now that you mention it...
or maybe Aramaic.

567
00:45:11,601 --> 00:45:12,641
Or... or... North African?

568
00:45:13,041 --> 00:45:14,361
Excuse me.

569
00:45:14,681 --> 00:45:15,721
Oh, you see: age!

570
00:45:16,241 --> 00:45:18,321
My memory plays some tricks on me.

571
00:45:18,961 --> 00:45:19,721
Yes?

572
00:45:20,321 --> 00:45:21,681
L...we're together yes...

573
00:45:22,721 --> 00:45:23,321
where?

574
00:45:23,761 --> 00:45:24,641
I have some books,

575
00:45:24,801 --> 00:45:27,041
and it will take no time, it's just that

576
00:45:27,201 --> 00:45:28,241
unfortunately,

577
00:45:28,761 --> 00:45:34,361
me and my assistant are preparing to host
a little party for some friends this evening,

578
00:45:34,881 --> 00:45:35,761
SO...

579
00:45:35,921 --> 00:45:39,081
Vassago, we just received a
phone call and we must go.

580
00:45:39,641 --> 00:45:41,601
We hope that you can
help us in the future.

581
00:45:41,761 --> 00:45:45,001
Please, check your books and if you
find out something, please just call us.

582
00:45:45,561 --> 00:45:46,881
Of course, <i>I'll</i> surely do that.

583
00:45:48,361 --> 00:45:51,121
Liliana, why don't you take
these gentlemen to the door?

584
00:45:52,001 --> 00:45:54,081
Have a nice day, officers!

585
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:14,201
Hans, did you see that?

586
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:16,041
The SATOR? Yes. What's going on?

587
00:46:16,201 --> 00:46:17,241
It was the police station.

588
00:46:17,401 --> 00:46:19,681
We have to go to the suburbs.
There was another murder.

589
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:21,961
There's no time for shit.

590
00:46:22,521 --> 00:46:25,282
We'll be back later: maybe we will
find a way of getting in unnoticed.

591
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:39,241
What a waste. A waste.

592
00:46:40,361 --> 00:46:41,801
Oh! Look here.

593
00:46:43,121 --> 00:46:47,521
Dear colleagues, thanks for coming again
and what a pleasure to see you again.

594
00:46:47,681 --> 00:46:49,401
You're doing a very good job, look here!

595
00:46:49,561 --> 00:46:52,241
Another victim,
and what are you doing here?

596
00:46:52,881 --> 00:46:54,721
I don't know what to say:

597
00:46:54,881 --> 00:46:56,921
your investigations are going very well,

598
00:46:57,081 --> 00:46:57,801
too well!

599
00:46:58,521 --> 00:47:01,641
If you carry on like this there
will be more and more work,

600
00:47:01,801 --> 00:47:03,921
and then NOTHING for years,

601
00:47:04,081 --> 00:47:06,401
as everybody will be dead in this city!

602
00:47:06,801 --> 00:47:09,761
Have a look over there,
and tell me what you think of that.

603
00:47:11,081 --> 00:47:14,081
The next few days will
be like HELL for you.

604
00:47:14,641 --> 00:47:16,961
You have got to find me this brute.

605
00:47:17,361 --> 00:47:19,081
Do you know who found the body?

606
00:47:19,481 --> 00:47:21,761
This wonderful body? A young boy!

607
00:47:21,921 --> 00:47:25,041
What the fuck was an eleven
year old boy doing around here?

608
00:47:26,921 --> 00:47:30,401
I have to solve this case
as soon as possible,

609
00:47:30,921 --> 00:47:35,881
even if I have to RIP a
confession out of the two

610
00:47:36,241 --> 00:47:39,241
of you and say that YOU
committed this crime!

611
00:47:40,401 --> 00:47:41,761
Vaffanculo...

612
00:48:12,841 --> 00:48:15,161
I don't believe you understand, you know...

613
00:48:15,881 --> 00:48:17,121
No, it's tomorrow.

614
00:48:19,321 --> 00:48:21,401
The official meeting is for tomorrow...

615
00:48:22,801 --> 00:48:25,641
This evening I will see Mr. Lanza.

616
00:48:26,521 --> 00:48:27,921
Ah, don't worry about this:

617
00:48:28,441 --> 00:48:31,161
don't you pay your lawyers
to resolve this case?

618
00:48:32,721 --> 00:48:35,161
Yes of course, me too.

619
00:48:36,241 --> 00:48:38,801
You know that we can't
talk too much about that.

620
00:48:39,441 --> 00:48:40,041
So,

621
00:48:40,201 --> 00:48:43,481
have a drink and enjoy your life.

622
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:45,121
Ok? Bye.

623
00:48:46,961 --> 00:48:47,601
I'm sorry,

624
00:48:48,201 --> 00:48:50,361
they've been busting my
balls for the last few days.

625
00:48:50,921 --> 00:48:54,641
Then this idiot calls me to piss me off,

626
00:48:55,681 --> 00:48:58,961
he knows very well I can't
talk about this on the phone.

627
00:48:59,721 --> 00:49:01,561
Are you worried about tomorrow?

628
00:49:02,121 --> 00:49:03,201
Not at all,

629
00:49:03,561 --> 00:49:05,641
it's just a political meeting:

630
00:49:07,121 --> 00:49:11,041
they want me to take the flak,
to save their asses.

631
00:49:11,481 --> 00:49:14,561
But there's no proof, no phone hacking.

632
00:49:15,081 --> 00:49:17,521
And I am in very good hands:

633
00:49:18,201 --> 00:49:20,201
Mr. Lanza, the lawyer,

634
00:49:20,361 --> 00:49:22,441
he knows me very, very well.

635
00:49:23,401 --> 00:49:26,481
He knows my power and
he knows my privileges.

636
00:49:27,201 --> 00:49:29,681
Drugs are a big privilege.

637
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:31,161
You're right.

638
00:49:32,361 --> 00:49:34,681
We will be relaxing tonight,

639
00:49:36,281 --> 00:49:37,481
you'll see.

640
00:49:44,921 --> 00:49:48,041
What is the name of the professor again?

641
00:49:49,761 --> 00:49:50,921
The antiquarian?

642
00:49:52,201 --> 00:49:53,521
Mr. Vassago:

643
00:49:55,241 --> 00:49:57,001
he's a real benefactor.

644
00:49:57,721 --> 00:50:01,441
He helped me to solve some big problems.

645
00:50:03,321 --> 00:50:06,121
But I don't want to think
about problems this night:

646
00:50:06,281 --> 00:50:08,401
I just want to relax myself.

647
00:50:08,561 --> 00:50:10,561
I just wanna have fun,

648
00:50:10,721 --> 00:50:13,081
and I want to introduce you to him.

649
00:50:15,201 --> 00:50:17,281
We have the same passions.

650
00:50:28,601 --> 00:50:30,241
Welcome, my friend!

651
00:50:30,881 --> 00:50:34,921
Good evening, Mr. Vassago.
Can I introduce you to my wife?

652
00:50:35,081 --> 00:50:36,841
Enchanté Madame.

653
00:50:37,081 --> 00:50:38,601
Pleased to meet you.

654
00:50:38,761 --> 00:50:40,721
Go ahead,
<i>I'll</i> be right there.

655
00:50:42,801 --> 00:50:43,641
I have a...

656
00:50:43,801 --> 00:50:45,241
a beautiful gift for you!

657
00:50:45,401 --> 00:50:48,801
A gift? Oh, my friend you
shouldn't have done that!

658
00:50:48,961 --> 00:50:52,161
Let's see this gift, I'm really intrigued!

659
00:50:59,121 --> 00:51:00,561
Ah, what a surprise!

660
00:51:01,561 --> 00:51:04,601
Is the student trying to
overcome his teacher?

661
00:51:05,681 --> 00:51:07,282
What a beautiful fawn you brought to me:

662
00:51:09,601 --> 00:51:11,601
you are a skilled hunter!

663
00:51:12,321 --> 00:51:14,881
It's just a gift for you, nobody else.

664
00:51:16,041 --> 00:51:19,521
Thank you so much my friend,
but let's go inside:

665
00:51:19,681 --> 00:51:22,281
I have many surprises for you!

666
00:51:22,441 --> 00:51:23,841
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

667
00:51:45,921 --> 00:51:47,921
Honey, who's that girl we've met before?

668
00:51:49,681 --> 00:51:51,441
I think I know her.

669
00:51:51,881 --> 00:51:55,161
Something tells me that
you don't watch television!

670
00:51:55,761 --> 00:51:57,841
She's Karen: she's a soubrette.

671
00:51:58,321 --> 00:52:00,841
She has some problems
with drugs and money,

672
00:52:01,561 --> 00:52:06,721
and sometimes I help her to solve
her issues, you know, with work.

673
00:52:07,161 --> 00:52:09,241
Oh yes, now I remember!

674
00:52:20,161 --> 00:52:24,081
Maybe you can put in a good word for me,
we could become a couple.

675
00:52:24,761 --> 00:52:26,121
Oh... Sure,

676
00:52:27,681 --> 00:52:28,481
why not.

677
00:52:40,041 --> 00:52:41,001
Nice

678
00:52:41,161 --> 00:52:43,041
beautiful party, beautiful dancer,

679
00:52:43,481 --> 00:52:44,721
beautiful woman.

680
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:45,681
Nice place, eh?

681
00:52:48,401 --> 00:52:50,361
- Let's have a drink?
- All right.

682
00:52:53,801 --> 00:52:55,241
That's for you.Thank-you.

683
00:52:55,521 --> 00:52:56,601
That's for me.

684
00:52:57,641 --> 00:52:58,721
Cheers.

685
00:53:01,441 --> 00:53:04,561
I want to introduce you to a friend,
the lawyer Lanza,

686
00:53:04,721 --> 00:53:07,561
I told you before. He's
a good friend of mine.

687
00:53:07,881 --> 00:53:09,242
Here's the man himself. Mr. Lanza.

688
00:53:10,481 --> 00:53:11,881
Oh! You look charming.

689
00:53:12,281 --> 00:53:12,781
Oh..thanks.

690
00:53:12,881 --> 00:53:15,001
- It's a real pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure.

691
00:53:15,161 --> 00:53:18,561
Come over, the professor
said he will be with us shortly.

692
00:53:19,401 --> 00:53:22,241
I told you the night would be interesting.

693
00:53:34,441 --> 00:53:36,721
Oh, you wonderful baby.

694
00:53:40,041 --> 00:53:43,521
We should ask the professor,
if we can sleep here...

695
00:53:44,361 --> 00:53:45,721
at the villa.

696
00:53:46,521 --> 00:53:47,881
Ooh... what do you think?

697
00:53:56,961 --> 00:53:58,361
Yeah, why not?

698
00:53:59,001 --> 00:54:01,841
Maybe you should ask Lanza to join us?

699
00:54:02,001 --> 00:54:03,761
Yes, I already have.

700
00:54:20,521 --> 00:54:23,321
- Hi. How are you?
- Nice to meet you.

701
00:54:45,281 --> 00:54:47,081
Nice surprise.

702
00:54:48,521 --> 00:54:50,121
Oh yes... I love surprises.

703
00:54:50,281 --> 00:54:50,841
Yes?

704
00:54:52,201 --> 00:54:53,641
Best quality.

705
00:55:43,681 --> 00:55:44,321
Good evening.

706
00:55:45,321 --> 00:55:47,481
The professor is in his study:

707
00:55:48,241 --> 00:55:52,001
he has spent the whole day
preparing for this evening,

708
00:55:52,641 --> 00:55:55,001
and still has some work to finish off.

709
00:55:55,761 --> 00:56:01,841
He will be here shortly, but in the
meantime please make yourselves at home.

710
00:56:02,561 --> 00:56:06,001
We're waiting for him,
it's a pity that he's not here with us,

711
00:56:06,721 --> 00:56:08,041
but it's okay.

712
00:56:09,881 --> 00:56:11,081
Do I know you? Who are you?

713
00:56:11,721 --> 00:56:13,121
What's your name?

714
00:56:13,561 --> 00:56:14,321
Liliana.

715
00:56:15,601 --> 00:56:18,441
I am the professor's personal assistant.

716
00:56:18,921 --> 00:56:20,641
So will you take a drink with us?

717
00:56:21,241 --> 00:56:22,121
No thank you.

718
00:56:23,001 --> 00:56:25,041
<i>I'll</i> drink with you later.

719
00:56:25,601 --> 00:56:27,761
We're looking forward to that.

720
00:56:27,921 --> 00:56:29,001
Whenever you want.

721
00:56:40,761 --> 00:56:45,481
The time has come to really
open the eyes of our guests,

722
00:56:46,521 --> 00:56:48,641
and show them the gates

723
00:56:49,361 --> 00:56:51,641
to the kingdom of terror!

724
00:57:05,201 --> 00:57:06,681
Oh no, dear,

725
00:57:07,441 --> 00:57:10,401
it's not with me that you
will sate your hunger:

726
00:57:11,641 --> 00:57:15,641
save your fury for the last course!

727
00:57:19,241 --> 00:57:25,801
The time will come, and we will come back
to this “unfortunate misunderstanding”,

728
00:57:26,281 --> 00:57:28,361
and we will take measures.

729
00:57:28,521 --> 00:57:33,841
The brain must be able to trust its arm.

730
00:57:34,281 --> 00:57:35,361
Oh, yes.

731
00:57:45,681 --> 00:57:46,681
Do we enter from here?

732
00:57:46,961 --> 00:57:49,081
Wait. I will look for another entrance.

733
01:00:34,641 --> 01:00:35,921
My dear guests,

734
01:00:37,281 --> 01:00:38,761
welcome to you all,

735
01:00:40,201 --> 01:00:42,921
I am very sorry I have made you wait.

736
01:00:43,761 --> 01:00:47,361
Your patience will be suitably rewarded,

737
01:00:47,841 --> 01:00:49,201
let me assure you!

738
01:00:49,481 --> 01:00:53,121
I know how much you have
waited for this moment

739
01:00:53,281 --> 01:00:57,881
and I myself have been excited for days,
let me tell you.

740
01:01:00,001 --> 01:01:04,561
I think you can imagine that when one
organises meetings such as this one

741
01:01:04,721 --> 01:01:09,241
must be prepared for any
sort of unforeseen event.

742
01:01:10,961 --> 01:01:13,961
And it happened just a short time ago

743
01:01:14,121 --> 01:01:17,201
that two “unexpected guests”

744
01:01:18,081 --> 01:01:21,441
decided to take part in our banquet...

745
01:01:22,801 --> 01:01:25,561
And we had no hesitation

746
01:01:25,721 --> 01:01:28,001
in agreeing to their request!

747
01:01:28,841 --> 01:01:32,361
Let the party begin, ladies and gentlemen!

748
01:03:01,201 --> 01:03:02,761
Let's eat.

749
01:04:00,921 --> 01:04:02,961
Ladies and gentlemen.

750
01:04:03,121 --> 01:04:07,361
We didn't serve the lungs because
they are too difficult to digest,

751
01:04:08,041 --> 01:04:10,561
due to their very compact structure.

752
01:04:11,321 --> 01:04:14,761
The heart is nutritious and free of fat,

753
01:04:15,321 --> 01:04:16,641
such as the liver,

754
01:04:17,161 --> 01:04:21,521
but unfortunately one of the two
"guests" was a heavy drinker,

755
01:04:21,681 --> 01:04:25,121
and his liver was too
hard and not edible.

756
01:04:26,121 --> 01:04:26,761
The brain

757
01:04:27,241 --> 01:04:28,561
on the other hand

758
01:04:29,001 --> 01:04:31,401
is rich in cholesterol,

759
01:04:32,121 --> 01:04:33,681
and I do not recommend it,

760
01:04:33,841 --> 01:04:36,681
if you suffer from arteriosclerosis.

761
01:04:38,841 --> 01:04:41,361
That is the spleen:

762
01:04:42,121 --> 01:04:43,961
it is especially fine.

763
01:04:55,721 --> 01:04:56,961
My dear friends,

764
01:04:58,201 --> 01:05:04,121
I see with great joy that the specialities
of the house are to your satisfaction!

765
01:05:05,321 --> 01:05:07,681
What wonderful guests you are,

766
01:05:09,281 --> 01:05:12,441
you have not disappointed me at all!

767
01:05:13,161 --> 01:05:16,161
As I was saying to you a short time ago,

768
01:05:16,641 --> 01:05:22,841
we have decided to keep the
best till last, for the grand finale.

769
01:05:23,801 --> 01:05:26,681
I am sure that what I am going to tell you

770
01:05:27,201 --> 01:05:31,401
will act <i>as</i> a further stimulus
to your animal instincts

771
01:05:33,281 --> 01:05:35,241
and impulses,

772
01:05:36,281 --> 01:05:41,801
and you must not put up
any resistance my friends:

773
01:05:42,361 --> 01:05:46,161
do your worst in your depravity!

774
01:05:46,601 --> 01:05:53,721
This evening you will get the
opportunity to have a real taste of life!

775
01:05:54,441 --> 01:05:59,681
To feel a soul leaving its body,

776
01:06:00,961 --> 01:06:03,481
to have the power of death

777
01:06:03,881 --> 01:06:06,841
and pain in your hands!

778
01:06:08,481 --> 01:06:10,161
You will kill for me,

779
01:06:10,321 --> 01:06:11,681
all together:

780
01:06:11,841 --> 01:06:16,121
the banquet of blood is not over yet!

781
01:06:33,961 --> 01:06:37,521
What the fuck is that? Get
out of here. Get out of here..

782
01:06:37,841 --> 01:06:38,341
Oh fuck!

783
01:07:15,161 --> 01:07:17,241
Help...

784
01:07:22,161 --> 01:07:24,641
Bea, where are you?

785
01:07:29,321 --> 01:07:30,721
Where the fuck are you?

786
01:09:52,841 --> 01:09:53,361
Die.

787
01:09:54,281 --> 01:09:55,281
You fuck. Die.

788
01:11:52,321 --> 01:11:53,761
Thank you, Liliana.

789
01:11:54,361 --> 01:11:55,441
Our mutual friend,

790
01:11:57,121 --> 01:12:01,081
during his last “exhibition”
created one or two problems,

791
01:12:01,601 --> 01:12:04,081
that however couldn't be overlooked,

792
01:12:04,521 --> 01:12:07,401
so we had to terminate our collaboration.

793
01:12:07,601 --> 01:12:10,361
Of course professor, I understand.

794
01:12:11,121 --> 01:12:13,641
- What can I do for you now?
- Oh, it has been a...

795
01:12:14,601 --> 01:12:18,161
a long and fantastic night for everybody

796
01:12:18,921 --> 01:12:22,841
and I must confess that
the success of our party

797
01:12:23,001 --> 01:12:25,441
has been largely down to you, my dear.

798
01:12:25,601 --> 01:12:27,481
I'm very proud of you!

799
01:12:28,041 --> 01:12:33,441
It was all so perfect,
I can't ask any more of you.

800
01:12:34,081 --> 01:12:37,401
But I'm sure you feel
very tired and worn out,

801
01:12:37,961 --> 01:12:41,081
so come, let me take you to your room.

802
01:12:41,481 --> 01:12:45,481
I'm sure you can do
with a little... rest...

803
01:13:35,201 --> 01:13:36,441
<i>Black Heron, please.</i>

804
01:13:38,921 --> 01:13:39,441
Thank you.

805
01:13:39,841 --> 01:13:40,921
Good evening.
