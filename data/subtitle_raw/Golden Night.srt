1
00:00:02,147 --> 00:00:03,562
Nuit d'Or?

2
00:00:09,223 --> 00:00:10,787
Nuit d'Or!

3
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:15,991
It's no use hiding.

4
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:19,273
I know you're here.

5
00:00:21,795 --> 00:00:23,439
It's me!

6
00:00:24,021 --> 00:00:25,842
Michel Fournier.

7
00:00:27,044 --> 00:00:29,270
Michel Fournier!

8
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:33,646
I'm all right.

9
00:00:34,273 --> 00:00:36,762
I'm starting all over again!

10
00:00:38,074 --> 00:00:39,787
And this time,

11
00:00:40,397 --> 00:00:42,298
I will win.

12
00:00:43,673 --> 00:00:46,351
So you can shuffle the cards!

13
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,104
Make the roulette wheels spin!

14
00:03:50,508 --> 00:03:52,169
"Thank you...

15
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,687
"Thank you, Mr...

16
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:56,783
"Mr Private Secretary...

17
00:03:56,982 --> 00:03:59,992
"for the kind words
you were good enough...

18
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:02,129
"to apply to me."

19
00:04:02,526 --> 00:04:04,276
And...

20
00:04:44,683 --> 00:04:46,704
"I'm not dead and you know it.

21
00:04:47,001 --> 00:04:49,912
"You burnt me alive.
I'm rising from the ashes.

22
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,478
"Michel."

23
00:05:36,926 --> 00:05:37,903
Hello?

24
00:05:38,193 --> 00:05:39,655
Did I wake you?

25
00:05:39,997 --> 00:05:41,861
You're a heavy sleeper.

26
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:45,076
- I've called you many times.
- Is this a joke?

27
00:05:45,506 --> 00:05:47,207
I'm back.

28
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:48,783
Hello?

29
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,883
Are you still there?

30
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:52,872
I'm not dead.

31
00:05:53,317 --> 00:05:55,943
You have burnt my body
but I'm not dead.

32
00:05:56,649 --> 00:05:58,375
- Michel?
- Yes.

33
00:06:02,664 --> 00:06:04,353
But what does this mean?

34
00:06:04,685 --> 00:06:06,756
- Where are you?
- I'm here.

35
00:06:07,298 --> 00:06:08,656
Nearby.

36
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:10,597
I see you.

37
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,720
Go to the window.

38
00:06:13,179 --> 00:06:14,880
With the phone.

39
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,990
The wire is long enough.

40
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:22,095
MICHEL FOURNIER DEAD

41
00:08:05,221 --> 00:08:07,699
Do you recognize him,
Superintendent?

42
00:08:16,387 --> 00:08:18,568
It's your brother.

43
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,420
Please don't.

44
00:08:22,198 --> 00:08:24,025
It's awful.

45
00:09:00,827 --> 00:09:01,809
Hello, sir.

46
00:09:01,929 --> 00:09:04,161
A man gave me this for you.
It's very urgent.

47
00:09:04,439 --> 00:09:05,891
Good bye.

48
00:09:50,671 --> 00:09:53,103
No crime remains unpunished.

49
00:09:55,285 --> 00:09:58,699
You should know that, Henri,
my dear brother.

50
00:10:26,603 --> 00:10:27,665
Henri?

51
00:10:28,014 --> 00:10:29,902
It's Michel's voice.

52
00:10:33,327 --> 00:10:35,068
Michel?

53
00:10:48,237 --> 00:10:49,704
Mummy!

54
00:11:02,137 --> 00:11:03,798
What's happening?

55
00:11:05,214 --> 00:11:06,852
Nothing, sweetie.

56
00:11:08,642 --> 00:11:10,251
Go back to sleep.

57
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:13,534
That's nothing.

58
00:11:48,198 --> 00:11:49,762
Michel.

59
00:12:55,988 --> 00:12:57,438
Mummy.

60
00:13:01,421 --> 00:13:03,345
Mummy...

61
00:13:12,085 --> 00:13:13,901
Mummy, wake up.

62
00:13:35,896 --> 00:13:37,300
That's it.

63
00:13:37,914 --> 00:13:39,472
Sleep.

64
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,866
Sleep...

65
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,208
One day, you won't wake up.

66
00:13:53,781 --> 00:13:56,179
One day, you won't wake up.

67
00:14:04,414 --> 00:14:05,698
Hello?

68
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,291
Clinique des Amandiers?

69
00:14:09,384 --> 00:14:11,359
Superintendent Pidoux speaking.

70
00:14:12,113 --> 00:14:13,871
Ah, it's you. Hello.

71
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:16,947
How is my wife?

72
00:14:18,592 --> 00:14:20,328
Did she eat?

73
00:14:21,344 --> 00:14:23,799
I know you can't force her but...

74
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,169
And her sleep?

75
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:31,521
Nightmares.

76
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:39,946
She asked for Michel?

77
00:14:46,275 --> 00:14:48,171
Yes, I'm still here.

78
00:14:49,381 --> 00:14:50,751
Look...

79
00:14:51,014 --> 00:14:54,360
I'm done with everything here in Paris.
I'll be able to go to Lausanne.

80
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:57,061
Yes, yes...

81
00:14:57,335 --> 00:14:59,332
Yes, she'll be pleased.

82
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:02,886
Thanks for everything.

83
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:06,391
Goodbye, Miss Blanche.

84
00:15:15,556 --> 00:15:17,634
She asked for Michel.

85
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:47,929
Hurry up!

86
00:15:59,806 --> 00:16:00,857
Madam.

87
00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:03,014
Your husband wants to see you.

88
00:16:07,397 --> 00:16:08,779
Henri?

89
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:17,461
Henri, what's happening?

90
00:16:22,628 --> 00:16:23,895
Henri?

91
00:16:27,896 --> 00:16:29,540
Oh, Michel...

92
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:48,421
I love you.

93
00:17:06,624 --> 00:17:08,263
You're so beautiful.

94
00:17:11,384 --> 00:17:13,073
I saw her.

95
00:17:13,718 --> 00:17:15,625
She's grown, you know.

96
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,724
She looks like you.

97
00:17:29,401 --> 00:17:30,965
I love you.

98
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,350
Stop it.

99
00:17:46,595 --> 00:17:49,415
Your brother was dead for everyone.

100
00:17:50,043 --> 00:17:52,144
And here I am again...

101
00:17:52,954 --> 00:17:55,112
with my two sons.

102
00:17:56,865 --> 00:17:58,818
I loved him a lot.

103
00:17:59,423 --> 00:18:00,633
But...

104
00:18:01,138 --> 00:18:03,398
I never knew how to talk to him.

105
00:18:07,238 --> 00:18:09,271
We must forgive him.

106
00:18:09,758 --> 00:18:11,608
You too, Henri.

107
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:15,205
There's a place for the two of you.

108
00:20:14,516 --> 00:20:16,504
Don't play with that,
you may hurt yourself.

109
00:20:25,092 --> 00:20:26,795
Michel is somewhere
here in the store.

110
00:20:28,206 --> 00:20:29,470
How do you know?

111
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:32,540
I've found this in my office.

112
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,479
I won't let Michel...

113
00:20:47,588 --> 00:20:49,343
destroy all I've got.

114
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:51,570
All I own.

115
00:21:24,624 --> 00:21:26,231
Where's your father?

116
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,225
At the warehouses.

117
00:21:42,407 --> 00:21:44,063
Tell me, Superintendent.

118
00:21:44,531 --> 00:21:46,152
Michel and your wife, Marie,

119
00:21:46,392 --> 00:21:48,047
were very close.

120
00:21:48,926 --> 00:21:51,232
- They were very close!
- So what?

121
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:53,217
He made her crazy.

122
00:21:53,544 --> 00:21:56,529
Your wife set fire to
the warehouses to avenge him.

123
00:22:04,732 --> 00:22:06,099
Charles?

124
00:22:19,154 --> 00:22:20,935
Ah, here you are.

125
00:22:21,576 --> 00:22:24,425
Leave all that
and take this to the room.

126
00:22:24,882 --> 00:22:26,288
I've been waiting for you.

127
00:22:27,323 --> 00:22:29,450
I believed, like everybody else,

128
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:30,916
he was dead.

129
00:22:31,991 --> 00:22:33,954
And all this time,

130
00:22:34,194 --> 00:22:36,180
he was around us.

131
00:22:36,534 --> 00:22:38,366
He was watching us.

132
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:45,504
Why playing...

133
00:22:46,777 --> 00:22:48,650
this grim little game?

134
00:22:51,219 --> 00:22:52,927
I loved him

135
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:56,721
despite the scandals
and the gambling debts.

136
00:22:59,891 --> 00:23:01,695
And then...

137
00:23:02,871 --> 00:23:04,755
there was the crime.

138
00:23:06,507 --> 00:23:09,236
The dreadful crime
in the Rue Duquesnes.

139
00:23:12,681 --> 00:23:14,611
No, no, no...

140
00:23:15,014 --> 00:23:17,878
No! He must disappear.
For ever.

141
00:23:18,278 --> 00:23:20,194
I'll give him what he wants.

142
00:23:21,613 --> 00:23:23,655
His return will cause
too much harm.

143
00:23:26,749 --> 00:23:29,163
Please, Fernand.
Find him.

144
00:23:30,538 --> 00:23:32,048
I will, Charles.

145
00:23:33,339 --> 00:23:35,550
As for the insurance,
it's sorting itself out.

146
00:23:35,862 --> 00:23:39,762
They admitted the possibility
of an accidental fire.

147
00:23:40,616 --> 00:23:42,740
A purely accidental fire.

148
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:45,334
Marie has nothing to do with it.

149
00:23:45,719 --> 00:23:47,432
Officially.

150
00:23:48,489 --> 00:23:51,065
I'll never forget
what you've done for my wife.

151
00:23:51,327 --> 00:23:53,051
I'll find Michel.

152
00:23:54,337 --> 00:23:55,563
Thank you.

153
00:23:56,525 --> 00:23:59,070
We're not allowed
to forget men like you.

154
00:23:59,283 --> 00:24:01,961
Men who, with a deep
sense of humanity, have

155
00:24:02,326 --> 00:24:04,079
preserved the essential thing,
namely:

156
00:24:04,348 --> 00:24:06,029
the honour of the police.

157
00:24:21,057 --> 00:24:23,116
Thank you, Mr Private Secretary,

158
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:25,622
for the kind words
you were good enough

159
00:24:25,942 --> 00:24:27,206
to apply to me.

160
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:30,259
Thank you too,
my dear colleagues.

161
00:24:31,154 --> 00:24:33,458
This lamp you gave me

162
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:35,994
will always be on my desk

163
00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:41,135
as a souvenir for the 30 years
I've been working here.

164
00:24:42,309 --> 00:24:44,687
Let's hope he'll be brief.
I am expected at the Ministry.

165
00:24:48,045 --> 00:24:51,901
You know the story of
The Phantom of the Opera

166
00:24:52,152 --> 00:24:55,109
who come back to haunt
the place he liked so much.

167
00:24:55,326 --> 00:24:56,490
Well...

168
00:24:58,167 --> 00:25:01,519
If one day you met
the figure of an old man,

169
00:25:03,157 --> 00:25:05,280
don't be scared by him.

170
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:11,765
Another present
has just been brought.

171
00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:14,856
One more present?
I haven't seen it.

172
00:25:15,077 --> 00:25:16,755
Let's open it together.

173
00:25:17,216 --> 00:25:18,517
Sorry, I have to go.

174
00:25:18,637 --> 00:25:20,470
- Take care.
- Thank you, sir.

175
00:25:34,485 --> 00:25:38,127
What a strange idea,
giving a doll to a man of my age...

176
00:25:55,619 --> 00:25:57,018
Have you seen this?

177
00:26:10,666 --> 00:26:12,116
"My name is Marie,

178
00:26:12,426 --> 00:26:14,263
"the arsonist, the lunatic.

179
00:26:14,947 --> 00:26:17,038
"Meet me tonight at my mother's."

180
00:26:17,556 --> 00:26:19,229
"Signed, Michel."

181
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:26,591
That's a strange doll.

182
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:37,147
Here he is.
Like every Monday.

183
00:27:40,688 --> 00:27:42,140
Come on, Catherine.

184
00:27:58,651 --> 00:28:00,450
I saw you in the park.

185
00:28:00,873 --> 00:28:03,587
You shouldn't follow
the little girls.

186
00:28:05,301 --> 00:28:06,982
I haven't asked you anything.

187
00:28:07,501 --> 00:28:09,133
Of course you haven't.

188
00:28:11,926 --> 00:28:14,021
I recognized you immediately.

189
00:28:14,502 --> 00:28:16,320
You are Michel Fournier,

190
00:28:16,615 --> 00:28:19,180
the golden chain killer.

191
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:40,758
- See you on Monday.
- Good bye.

192
00:29:24,371 --> 00:29:26,208
Do you recognize me?

193
00:30:08,817 --> 00:30:10,552
Superintendent Pidoux!

194
00:30:11,306 --> 00:30:13,492
How glad I am to see you again!

195
00:30:15,258 --> 00:30:17,074
Will you come and sit here?

196
00:30:20,628 --> 00:30:22,194
Like old times.

197
00:30:22,924 --> 00:30:24,294
No?

198
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:27,405
You always used to sit there.

199
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,829
At the table of the rich.

200
00:30:31,942 --> 00:30:34,201
You were a sorry sight.
A poor man.

201
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,810
The poor are not
necessarily happy, are they?

202
00:30:41,489 --> 00:30:43,542
Cheap ready-made suit.

203
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,118
Imitation silk tie.

204
00:30:48,704 --> 00:30:49,989
Simulated leather wallet.

205
00:30:50,109 --> 00:30:53,025
You had lost before
you started to gamble.

206
00:30:55,649 --> 00:30:57,531
I know the face of luck.

207
00:30:59,256 --> 00:31:01,104
I also know
the signs of misfortune.

208
00:31:36,191 --> 00:31:38,172
Michel Fournier is dead.

209
00:31:39,212 --> 00:31:41,651
If he wasn't,
he would be at this table.

210
00:31:42,427 --> 00:31:43,952
And he would be losing

211
00:31:44,207 --> 00:31:45,848
as he always did.

212
00:31:47,241 --> 00:31:49,098
But he could afford it.

213
00:31:51,162 --> 00:31:52,937
Blessed are the rich,

214
00:31:53,643 --> 00:31:56,961
for theirs is the kingdom of debts.

215
00:32:04,742 --> 00:32:05,980
Watch them.

216
00:32:08,054 --> 00:32:09,192
Watch them closely.

217
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:13,550
They win.

218
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:15,707
They lose.

219
00:32:16,986 --> 00:32:19,097
They always lose in the end.

220
00:32:21,479 --> 00:32:24,019
They turn yellow, they turn pale...

221
00:32:24,848 --> 00:32:26,811
They wither.

222
00:32:27,977 --> 00:32:30,166
And they get old like their cards.

223
00:32:30,647 --> 00:32:32,142
And then...

224
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:46,606
Look at this one.

225
00:32:55,567 --> 00:32:57,137
Has been actor.

226
00:32:58,297 --> 00:33:00,375
Old ham of second-rate play.

227
00:33:00,942 --> 00:33:02,618
Always playing supporting roles.

228
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,090
In one word, shit.

229
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,751
All he earns as a TV whore,
he comes here to lose it.

230
00:33:11,686 --> 00:33:13,376
He gives me all.

231
00:33:15,688 --> 00:33:17,923
Old queen of the studios!

232
00:33:18,811 --> 00:33:20,573
Nobody wants him anymore.

233
00:33:24,782 --> 00:33:27,151
If I closed my business,
he'd kill himself.

234
00:33:27,884 --> 00:33:29,140
Enough!
Where's Michel?

235
00:33:31,645 --> 00:33:35,237
I don't like the smell of corpses,
especially this one.

236
00:33:35,449 --> 00:33:37,055
You killed him!

237
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,181
They killed him.

238
00:33:57,575 --> 00:33:59,934
Michel Fournier is alive.

239
00:34:08,882 --> 00:34:10,860
Alive. Your hear me?

240
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:13,641
He's come back.

241
00:34:14,315 --> 00:34:16,164
He shouldn't have.

242
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:19,512
They'll kill him.

243
00:34:19,964 --> 00:34:21,094
Yes.

244
00:34:21,354 --> 00:34:22,921
They'll kill him once again.

245
00:34:26,151 --> 00:34:27,314
Who are "they"?

246
00:34:28,778 --> 00:34:31,039
They hate us.

247
00:34:38,978 --> 00:34:40,895
And you're the one
who'll kill him.

248
00:34:42,597 --> 00:34:44,456
You're drunk.

249
00:34:46,521 --> 00:34:48,553
Yes, yes...

250
00:34:49,241 --> 00:34:51,419
I am drunk.

251
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,881
Why do you defend him so much?

252
00:35:07,046 --> 00:35:10,179
Men like you don't
grow old gracefully.

253
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,801
Poor old fag!

254
00:35:17,312 --> 00:35:18,711
Cop!

255
00:35:24,285 --> 00:35:25,804
Hello, Mrs Jansen?

256
00:35:26,831 --> 00:35:28,544
Did Catherine leave?

257
00:35:29,115 --> 00:35:30,713
How long?

258
00:35:32,341 --> 00:35:33,951
Half an hour?

259
00:35:34,965 --> 00:35:36,666
No, thank you.

260
00:35:56,063 --> 00:35:57,330
Hello, Henri?

261
00:35:57,872 --> 00:35:59,562
Catherine hasn't come back home.

262
00:35:59,984 --> 00:36:01,240
Come quick.

263
00:36:01,707 --> 00:36:03,288
It's serious.

264
00:36:30,745 --> 00:36:32,720
You'll never see her again.

265
00:36:34,385 --> 00:36:35,993
Catherine is mine.

266
00:36:36,263 --> 00:36:37,713
Like Véronique.

267
00:36:52,722 --> 00:36:54,401
Your parents say hello.

268
00:36:54,823 --> 00:36:56,535
Especially your mother.

269
00:37:21,799 --> 00:37:22,966
I am Catherine.

270
00:37:23,165 --> 00:37:25,535
If you call the police,
the chain will be pulled

271
00:37:25,734 --> 00:37:27,123
and I will die

272
00:37:42,913 --> 00:37:44,957
- You must call the police.
- I'm begging you...

273
00:37:46,993 --> 00:37:48,615
He'll kill her.

274
00:37:48,951 --> 00:37:50,789
He's going to kill her.

275
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,580
Like he killed the little girl
from the Rue Duquesne.

276
00:37:54,884 --> 00:37:55,965
She was 11.

277
00:37:56,184 --> 00:37:57,399
She was home alone.

278
00:37:57,813 --> 00:38:00,182
She wore a short dress.

279
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:05,911
He came from behind.

280
00:38:07,162 --> 00:38:09,292
A golden chain in his hand.

281
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:13,022
He squeezed very hard.

282
00:38:13,346 --> 00:38:15,096
She didn't cry.
She didn't scream.

283
00:38:15,216 --> 00:38:16,760
She had no time.

284
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:20,379
She fell down.
Her tongue was hanging out.

285
00:38:21,874 --> 00:38:23,580
Her face was pale.

286
00:38:25,284 --> 00:38:26,895
A childs neck...

287
00:38:27,157 --> 00:38:28,406
is fragile.

288
00:38:28,671 --> 00:38:30,100
It's flaky.

289
00:38:30,868 --> 00:38:32,016
It cracks!

290
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,591
It's for me?

291
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:40,508
- Yes.
- Thanks.

292
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:46,597
And after that, I was...

293
00:38:46,961 --> 00:38:48,279
in the Upper Volta.

294
00:38:48,555 --> 00:38:50,389
I was a crocodile hunter.

295
00:38:51,587 --> 00:38:54,818
I had an elephant called Jimboboy.

296
00:38:55,365 --> 00:38:56,781
Jimboboy?

297
00:38:57,133 --> 00:38:59,237
Is that his first or last name?

298
00:38:59,829 --> 00:39:02,369
It is both.
But let me finish.

299
00:39:02,842 --> 00:39:03,995
My guide and I,

300
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:06,170
we knew that,
at a specific time,

301
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:08,140
when the night is falling,

302
00:39:09,026 --> 00:39:11,954
crocodiles come
to drink at the river...

303
00:39:13,415 --> 00:39:15,242
as big as the Amazon River.

304
00:39:15,616 --> 00:39:17,112
And then?

305
00:39:18,362 --> 00:39:20,101
And then...

306
00:39:20,526 --> 00:39:22,073
One hour passed.

307
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:24,136
Two hours passed.

308
00:39:25,309 --> 00:39:26,551
Nothing.

309
00:39:28,174 --> 00:39:29,783
Then all of a sudden...

310
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:32,240
Above me...

311
00:39:33,507 --> 00:39:34,718
Crack!

312
00:39:35,642 --> 00:39:37,209
Crack!

313
00:39:37,782 --> 00:39:39,575
What "crack! crack!"?

314
00:39:39,837 --> 00:39:41,813
I hear a noise above my head.

315
00:39:42,124 --> 00:39:43,348
Broken branches.

316
00:39:43,621 --> 00:39:45,014
Jumping from tree to tree.

317
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,721
I grab my gun!

318
00:39:47,044 --> 00:39:49,415
You had a gun?

319
00:39:51,692 --> 00:39:52,924
No.

320
00:39:53,313 --> 00:39:55,111
You're right. I had no gun.

321
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,111
What was this "crack! crack!"?

322
00:40:00,513 --> 00:40:02,354
The guide says to me,

323
00:40:03,574 --> 00:40:04,887
"shhh."

324
00:40:06,554 --> 00:40:08,141
Like that.

325
00:40:08,783 --> 00:40:10,366
Then we wait.

326
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,202
I hold my breath.

327
00:40:16,167 --> 00:40:17,880
Then all of a sudden,

328
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:20,317
I see its outline!

329
00:40:22,822 --> 00:40:24,935
You know what it was?

330
00:40:26,494 --> 00:40:27,564
A panther!

331
00:40:28,962 --> 00:40:30,354
A panther?!

332
00:40:31,023 --> 00:40:32,877
Black!

333
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:34,566
The worst.

334
00:40:41,946 --> 00:40:43,373
Hi, Pierre.

335
00:40:43,773 --> 00:40:46,387
I didn't know
you'd been in Africa.

336
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:49,948
His name isn't Pierre,
it's Michel.

337
00:41:12,019 --> 00:41:14,194
We have to go home now, don't we?

338
00:41:16,052 --> 00:41:17,925
We have plenty of time.

339
00:41:19,522 --> 00:41:21,240
Why did he call you "Pierre"?

340
00:41:52,534 --> 00:41:54,498
Do you live here?

341
00:41:54,852 --> 00:41:56,713
Yes. With them.

342
00:41:57,533 --> 00:42:00,302
And my parents,
what will they say?

343
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:02,352
Nothing.

344
00:42:02,727 --> 00:42:04,646
They know you're with me.

345
00:42:05,101 --> 00:42:06,928
And for a long time.

346
00:42:09,977 --> 00:42:11,279
Gabrielle.

347
00:42:13,538 --> 00:42:15,628
Anne, Marie...

348
00:42:16,437 --> 00:42:18,570
- Did they exist?
- Of course they did.

349
00:42:18,872 --> 00:42:20,272
A long time ago.

350
00:42:20,614 --> 00:42:22,316
And then they died?

351
00:42:22,784 --> 00:42:24,656
They became dolls.

352
00:42:26,893 --> 00:42:29,348
Did you change them into dolls?

353
00:42:34,542 --> 00:42:36,483
He doesn't let anybody go.

354
00:42:37,006 --> 00:42:39,541
You must put your hand in his.

355
00:42:41,927 --> 00:42:44,912
Let me go, sir.
I want to go upstairs.

356
00:43:06,179 --> 00:43:09,858
Once upon a time,
there was a man called

357
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,450
Michel.

358
00:43:11,844 --> 00:43:14,128
He was alone. All by himself.

359
00:43:14,436 --> 00:43:15,979
No one loved him.

360
00:43:20,059 --> 00:43:21,692
His father, Charles,

361
00:43:21,943 --> 00:43:24,254
was always finding what he did

362
00:43:24,722 --> 00:43:26,332
was wrong.

363
00:43:27,143 --> 00:43:29,243
His brother, Henri, was jealous

364
00:43:29,363 --> 00:43:31,951
because Michel had met before him

365
00:43:32,168 --> 00:43:34,113
a very beautiful queen.

366
00:43:36,464 --> 00:43:37,492
Véronique.

367
00:43:38,438 --> 00:43:41,948
Queen Véronique
loved Michel very much.

368
00:43:43,322 --> 00:43:44,852
So...

369
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:46,763
Charles and Henri

370
00:43:47,004 --> 00:43:50,364
wanted to make Michel disappear.

371
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:54,603
But Michel

372
00:43:54,945 --> 00:43:56,501
was not dead.

373
00:43:57,666 --> 00:43:59,196
He was in Africa.

374
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:01,765
There,

375
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:03,572
all alone,

376
00:44:04,527 --> 00:44:06,436
he was thinking about
Queen Véronique

377
00:44:07,964 --> 00:44:10,704
and the little princess Catherine.

378
00:44:11,906 --> 00:44:13,836
You.

379
00:44:17,537 --> 00:44:19,535
He loves them so much.

380
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:23,454
He says to the queen,

381
00:44:23,728 --> 00:44:25,201
"Come."

382
00:44:26,133 --> 00:44:27,994
He says to the princess,

383
00:44:28,382 --> 00:44:29,897
"Come."

384
00:44:32,173 --> 00:44:33,916
All three go away.

385
00:44:35,115 --> 00:44:37,527
And they are happy together.

386
00:44:42,871 --> 00:44:44,527
Sleep, Catherine.

387
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:47,282
Sleep...

388
00:45:34,662 --> 00:45:36,919
Is Catherine his daughter?

389
00:45:37,939 --> 00:45:39,572
She's my daughter.

390
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,502
My daughter!

391
00:46:37,064 --> 00:46:38,297
Michel?

392
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:40,433
Is that you?

393
00:46:45,823 --> 00:46:48,507
Answer me, my darling.

394
00:46:49,426 --> 00:46:51,915
I know that you will
come back to me.

395
00:46:52,584 --> 00:46:55,495
You didn't leave me alone,
did you?

396
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,611
I have been sad.

397
00:47:13,702 --> 00:47:15,415
Answer me!

398
00:47:18,189 --> 00:47:19,990
You're scaring me.

399
00:47:41,296 --> 00:47:43,541
They never come back to see me.

400
00:47:44,273 --> 00:47:45,506
Never!

401
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:49,602
They never come to see me.

402
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:51,920
Never!

403
00:47:54,537 --> 00:47:56,204
They're waiting...

404
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,803
for my death.

405
00:48:05,819 --> 00:48:08,148
Dying...

406
00:49:32,355 --> 00:49:34,510
It's very kind of you
to wait for me.

407
00:49:35,677 --> 00:49:37,962
Tell them they'll never
see her again.

408
00:49:40,437 --> 00:49:42,742
They'll give you
anything you want.

409
00:49:43,852 --> 00:49:45,088
All the money you want.

410
00:49:45,743 --> 00:49:47,399
Catherine is mine.

411
00:49:48,392 --> 00:49:50,750
And if you try anything,

412
00:49:51,432 --> 00:49:53,201
the police or you,

413
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:55,015
I'll kill her.

414
00:49:57,510 --> 00:49:58,595
What for?

415
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:01,760
For me.

416
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:05,317
Don't try to understand.
You're too stupid.

417
00:50:07,995 --> 00:50:09,525
Too thick.

418
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:17,603
What about the puppet?

419
00:50:18,037 --> 00:50:19,658
Did you enjoy it?

420
00:50:20,311 --> 00:50:22,077
It's a tribute to Marie,

421
00:50:22,469 --> 00:50:24,113
the loony.

422
00:50:24,846 --> 00:50:27,605
Institutionalized in Switzerland
by Daddy Fournier.

423
00:50:28,277 --> 00:50:30,434
And Supt Pidoux says,
"Amen and thank you."

424
00:50:30,737 --> 00:50:33,043
At his command.
Always at his command.

425
00:50:33,711 --> 00:50:36,119
You're not a cop.
You're a puppet!

426
00:51:06,106 --> 00:51:10,157
"The army of the exterminating angels
had two hundred million horsemen.

427
00:51:11,471 --> 00:51:13,540
"They wore breastplates
the color of fire

428
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:15,383
"and of hyacinth and of brimstone.

429
00:51:16,602 --> 00:51:19,699
"The heads of the horses
resembled the heads of lions.

430
00:51:21,272 --> 00:51:24,406
"A third of mankind was killed
by these three plagues.

431
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:27,105
"From their mouths
the horses belched

432
00:51:27,225 --> 00:51:29,398
"forth fire, and smoke,
and sulphur.

433
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:41,922
"I heard an eagle flying in midheaven,
saying with a loud voice,

434
00:51:42,589 --> 00:51:47,377
"Woe, woe, woe to those
who dwell on the earth,

435
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:50,665
"because of the remaining blasts
of the trumpet of the three angels

436
00:51:50,921 --> 00:51:52,306
who are about to sound!"

437
00:52:06,336 --> 00:52:07,805
He is the way.

438
00:52:08,278 --> 00:52:09,454
He is the strength.

439
00:52:11,157 --> 00:52:13,072
I don't want to hide anymore.

440
00:52:15,446 --> 00:52:17,276
He has taught you to say no

441
00:52:17,871 --> 00:52:19,337
to this mediocre world,

442
00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:22,217
without order,
without hierarchy.

443
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:25,285
He is the only true light.

444
00:52:29,764 --> 00:52:31,683
You're betraying, Brother Antoine.

445
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:44,074
You mustn't go back to society.

446
00:52:44,431 --> 00:52:46,160
I need your help.

447
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:48,338
He is our only family.

448
00:52:49,907 --> 00:52:50,958
They killed me!

449
00:52:52,832 --> 00:52:54,764
I have to tell,
Michel Fournier is alive.

450
00:52:56,007 --> 00:52:58,154
What life are you talking about?

451
00:54:10,757 --> 00:54:12,693
Tell me a story.

452
00:54:17,455 --> 00:54:18,560
Come on.

453
00:54:18,769 --> 00:54:20,725
I want to go back to my mother's.

454
00:54:23,184 --> 00:54:24,498
Yes, but...

455
00:54:24,772 --> 00:54:27,068
can't you tell me a story first?

456
00:54:28,982 --> 00:54:31,903
Adam and Eve and Pinch Me
went down to the river to play.

457
00:54:32,754 --> 00:54:35,352
Adam and Eve were drowned.
Who was saved?

458
00:54:36,699 --> 00:54:39,474
Adam and Eve were drowned, so...

459
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:42,957
Pinch Me was saved.

460
00:56:10,122 --> 00:56:11,321
Hello?

461
00:56:29,524 --> 00:56:31,054
They hung up...

462
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:35,129
They hung up!

463
00:56:45,482 --> 00:56:46,909
We're going to the country.

464
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:48,671
I don't want to.

465
00:56:48,899 --> 00:56:50,973
I want to go home right now!

466
00:56:58,548 --> 00:57:00,398
Today is my birthday.

467
00:57:01,913 --> 00:57:04,297
- I don't want to be alone.
- I don't care.

468
00:57:17,958 --> 00:57:19,738
I can't be alone.

469
00:57:22,352 --> 00:57:24,361
I don't care. I hate you.

470
00:58:21,365 --> 00:58:23,101
We are everywhere.

471
00:58:23,596 --> 00:58:24,676
Europe.

472
00:58:24,951 --> 00:58:26,115
Africa.

473
00:58:26,772 --> 00:58:28,165
America.

474
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:31,235
We are very powerful.

475
00:58:32,570 --> 00:58:35,663
God sent Him to drag the world
away from its mediocrity.

476
00:58:36,183 --> 00:58:38,082
To uproot communism and atheism.

477
00:58:38,459 --> 00:58:40,789
COME TO ME, I WILL
TAKE YOUR SUFFERING AWAY.

478
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:48,445
GIVE ME YOUR LOVE,
I WILL GIVE YOU PEACE

479
00:58:51,932 --> 00:58:53,576
Do you like it?

480
00:58:55,925 --> 00:58:57,343
Our army is big.

481
00:58:57,584 --> 00:58:58,981
And it will get bigger.

482
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:00,625
In every country, in every family,

483
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:03,320
we're recruiting girls and boys
who'll form the Army of God.

484
00:59:09,693 --> 00:59:11,451
Where are you going?

485
00:59:12,901 --> 00:59:15,127
To have a wee. May I?

486
00:59:17,607 --> 00:59:18,920
Go.

487
00:59:57,375 --> 00:59:59,395
- Don't you like it here?
- I want to go home.

488
00:59:59,515 --> 01:00:01,491
And his name isn't Antoine,
it's Michel.

489
01:00:02,334 --> 01:00:03,807
- I know that.
- Where is he?

490
01:00:05,275 --> 01:00:06,912
Don't ask questions.

491
01:00:15,804 --> 01:00:17,523
We'll save you from your family.

492
01:00:17,928 --> 01:00:19,167
From the world.

493
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:20,894
Do you understand?

494
01:00:21,425 --> 01:00:23,024
Against your will.

495
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:38,841
- Supt Pidoux?
- Yes.

496
01:00:39,332 --> 01:00:41,032
I'm downstairs. In the car park.

497
01:00:41,831 --> 01:00:43,739
On behalf of Michel Fournier.

498
01:00:53,242 --> 01:00:55,559
After the murder of the little girl,

499
01:00:55,913 --> 01:00:57,683
Michel was hiding.

500
01:00:58,311 --> 01:01:00,126
In fact, I knew Michel.

501
01:01:00,537 --> 01:01:02,535
We had done stupid things together.

502
01:01:02,899 --> 01:01:04,874
I was sent to kill him.

503
01:01:06,051 --> 01:01:07,728
But I couldn't do it.

504
01:01:18,545 --> 01:01:21,200
The body has been identified,
hasn't it?

505
01:01:22,233 --> 01:01:25,213
- When did you see him last?
- Two days ago.

506
01:01:25,654 --> 01:01:26,830
Where?

507
01:01:28,451 --> 01:01:30,078
Answer me. Where?

508
01:01:32,274 --> 01:01:33,535
No, no and no!

509
01:01:33,754 --> 01:01:35,140
I want you to leave me alone.

510
01:01:35,365 --> 01:01:37,722
- I am not a killer.
- Yeah, right.

511
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:40,111
Keep Henri Fournier under control.

512
01:01:40,339 --> 01:01:42,034
But I have nothing to do with it.

513
01:01:42,308 --> 01:01:43,461
Arsehole.

514
01:01:46,447 --> 01:01:48,000
- Superintendent!
- Yes?

515
01:01:48,308 --> 01:01:49,403
It's called...

516
01:01:50,026 --> 01:01:53,032
The Temple of
the Son of the True Light.

517
01:01:53,475 --> 01:01:55,576
- You'll find it?
- Yes, I know it.

518
01:01:57,381 --> 01:01:59,071
I may be a loser but not a killer!

519
01:02:08,848 --> 01:02:10,737
Say sorry to her.

520
01:02:12,005 --> 01:02:13,661
It's a game.

521
01:02:16,835 --> 01:02:18,661
She's going to say she's sorry.

522
01:02:19,312 --> 01:02:20,620
Right?

523
01:02:21,693 --> 01:02:23,154
Say you're sorry.

524
01:02:23,605 --> 01:02:26,103
Do it.
Say you're sorry.

525
01:02:27,335 --> 01:02:28,797
Sorry.

526
01:02:29,453 --> 01:02:32,101
And now,
we're playing another game.

527
01:02:32,466 --> 01:02:34,224
Hide and seek.

528
01:02:36,162 --> 01:02:37,207
Count!

529
01:02:37,436 --> 01:02:39,887
One, two, three...

530
01:03:07,511 --> 01:03:09,300
That's it. Hide!

531
01:03:10,265 --> 01:03:11,841
It's a game!

532
01:03:13,963 --> 01:03:15,652
Hide now, Catherine.

533
01:05:37,693 --> 01:05:39,971
Wherever you want
but not in that room.

534
01:05:55,796 --> 01:05:57,155
Come on.

535
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:00,367
I warned you.

536
01:06:03,458 --> 01:06:05,415
You shouldn't have gone in.

537
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:22,247
Catherine...

538
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:27,412
I've been waiting for you.

539
01:06:28,514 --> 01:06:31,314
I've always been waiting for you
for these past two years.

540
01:06:32,284 --> 01:06:35,024
After school.
At your piano lesson.

541
01:06:36,782 --> 01:06:39,334
I'm completely lost without you.

542
01:06:44,423 --> 01:06:46,096
I could kill you.

543
01:06:49,091 --> 01:06:50,747
Is anybody here?

544
01:06:53,053 --> 01:06:55,489
I'm looking for Michel Fournier.

545
01:06:57,741 --> 01:06:59,613
The man you call Michel Fournier

546
01:06:59,733 --> 01:07:02,626
was known by us
as Brother Antoine.

547
01:07:03,104 --> 01:07:04,828
He has betrayed us.

548
01:07:05,342 --> 01:07:06,924
He has returned to your world.

549
01:07:07,153 --> 01:07:08,728
The world of little people.

550
01:07:08,968 --> 01:07:10,635
The world of mediocrity.

551
01:07:11,206 --> 01:07:13,661
This world without faith,
without soul.

552
01:07:14,357 --> 01:07:17,197
He has dragged
Sister Andrée down with him.

553
01:07:17,868 --> 01:07:19,626
We'll guide you

554
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:21,636
so they'll be punished

555
01:07:21,990 --> 01:07:23,577
and exterminated.

556
01:07:23,932 --> 01:07:25,621
No one can escape
from the Master.

557
01:07:26,388 --> 01:07:27,598
Brother Antoine?

558
01:07:30,275 --> 01:07:32,307
No, I haven't seen him.

559
01:07:38,917 --> 01:07:40,487
It's serious.

560
01:07:41,269 --> 01:07:43,478
A child has been kidnapped.

561
01:07:45,237 --> 01:07:46,573
I'm from the police.

562
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:50,260
I despise the order you represent.

563
01:07:51,385 --> 01:07:53,154
There is nobody here.

564
01:07:53,645 --> 01:07:55,518
You can do nothing against us.

565
01:08:30,533 --> 01:08:31,652
Hello?

566
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:33,724
Michel...

567
01:08:34,135 --> 01:08:35,812
What about Catherine?

568
01:08:43,613 --> 01:08:44,858
Yes.

569
01:08:46,578 --> 01:08:48,337
Yes, I'll be there.

570
01:08:50,972 --> 01:08:52,547
Alone.

571
01:09:19,096 --> 01:09:20,335
Give the girl back.

572
01:09:38,242 --> 01:09:39,601
Michel?

573
01:09:39,955 --> 01:09:41,610
Is that you?

574
01:09:51,383 --> 01:09:53,244
Mummy! Mummy!

575
01:09:55,509 --> 01:09:56,696
I beg you.

576
01:09:56,936 --> 01:09:58,563
Don't drink.

577
01:09:59,050 --> 01:10:00,306
Come on, darling...

578
01:10:00,523 --> 01:10:02,367
Don't drink!

579
01:10:03,734 --> 01:10:05,572
I need you.

580
01:10:06,414 --> 01:10:07,956
Leave me alone.

581
01:10:08,541 --> 01:10:10,656
I have the right to drink.

582
01:10:10,909 --> 01:10:13,704
I have the right to die.

583
01:10:16,094 --> 01:10:19,510
It's so good, you know,
sleeping, isn't it?

584
01:10:19,999 --> 01:10:22,188
Sleeping for ever.

585
01:10:24,304 --> 01:10:26,210
You're just like me.

586
01:10:27,442 --> 01:10:29,726
You'll end up just like me.

587
01:11:26,602 --> 01:11:27,584
Catherine!

588
01:11:28,522 --> 01:11:30,303
He's going to kill me!

589
01:11:34,026 --> 01:11:35,365
I love you, Véronique.

590
01:11:55,813 --> 01:11:56,886
I love you.

591
01:12:04,502 --> 01:12:06,432
We're leaving, the three of us.

592
01:12:37,182 --> 01:12:38,186
Beat it!

593
01:12:40,943 --> 01:12:42,987
Serves you right.

594
01:12:51,361 --> 01:12:52,525
Come on.

595
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:54,152
Beat it!

596
01:13:15,996 --> 01:13:17,948
I've been waiting for you.

597
01:13:19,524 --> 01:13:21,739
I've been waiting for you
for a very long time.

598
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:24,793
Let's play.

599
01:14:14,546 --> 01:14:15,974
You lost.

600
01:14:29,713 --> 01:14:31,312
Nuit d'Or!

601
01:14:32,214 --> 01:14:34,075
Give him his money back.

602
01:14:34,791 --> 01:14:36,356
Go away, Michel.

603
01:14:36,687 --> 01:14:39,248
I won't do anything against you.
And nobody will.

604
01:14:47,383 --> 01:14:49,221
Poor Pidoux...

605
01:14:59,190 --> 01:15:00,628
We are losers.

606
01:15:00,914 --> 01:15:02,581
Both of us.

607
01:15:04,243 --> 01:15:06,058
Marie doesnt love you.

608
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:09,003
She never loved you.

609
01:15:10,237 --> 01:15:12,943
She became crazy
to never see you again.

610
01:15:14,473 --> 01:15:16,477
And never recognize you.

611
01:15:18,425 --> 01:15:20,662
How could anyone love you?

612
01:15:26,041 --> 01:15:28,039
You're going to kill me.

613
01:15:34,309 --> 01:15:36,387
This time, it will be for good.

614
01:15:37,231 --> 01:15:38,555
The real Michel Fournier.

615
01:15:41,895 --> 01:15:43,517
The show is over.

616
01:15:44,238 --> 01:15:46,251
No more faux-macabre.

617
01:15:52,246 --> 01:15:55,067
I am not a murderer.
I was wrongly accused.

618
01:15:55,626 --> 01:15:57,453
You always knew it.

619
01:16:28,394 --> 01:16:30,347
It wasn't loaded.

620
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:40,621
It has never been loaded.
