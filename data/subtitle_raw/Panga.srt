1
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:23,171
Stay awake!

2
00:01:29,194 --> 00:01:31,652
Stay awake!

3
00:01:58,851 --> 00:02:00,393
Jaya, stop.

4
00:02:00,997 --> 00:02:03,288
We're in the same team.

5
00:02:09,178 --> 00:02:11,303
Stay awake.

6
00:02:11,386 --> 00:02:13,053
Do I have a choice?

7
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:45,594
Papa, got kicked
again last night?

8
00:02:45,761 --> 00:02:47,428
Quiet!
Eat your breakfast.

9
00:02:47,594 --> 00:02:49,719
Mummy loves to serve.

10
00:02:49,844 --> 00:02:52,761
Kicks for you at night.
And breakfast for me in the morning.

11
00:02:54,011 --> 00:02:55,178
How about a shoe?

12
00:02:55,344 --> 00:02:58,469
Please get them.
I'll wear them after breakfast.

13
00:02:59,011 --> 00:03:01,678
Hurry... get your school bag.
We're late.

14
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,969
We can't handle this boy
and you wanted another one.

15
00:03:10,094 --> 00:03:12,094
If you kick me in the wrong place,

16
00:03:12,303 --> 00:03:14,261
another one won't be possible.

17
00:03:16,594 --> 00:03:18,886
Adi, you haven't
finished your milk.

18
00:03:19,178 --> 00:03:20,928
Prashant, the plates...

19
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:23,011
I'll close the windows,
turn off the taps and lights

20
00:03:23,094 --> 00:03:24,803
and put the plates inside.

21
00:03:25,344 --> 00:03:26,719
Take the helmet.

22
00:03:27,094 --> 00:03:28,985
I'm considering wearing one
to bed, too.

23
00:03:29,803 --> 00:03:30,928
Bye.

24
00:03:31,094 --> 00:03:32,678
Bye, love.
Bye, Adi.

25
00:03:32,844 --> 00:03:33,844
Bye, papa.

26
00:03:37,178 --> 00:03:38,178
Adi, wait.

27
00:03:41,094 --> 00:03:42,636
Here, eat this.

28
00:03:43,303 --> 00:03:45,053
Adi, just two basil leaves.

29
00:03:46,761 --> 00:03:49,136
Mummy, why do you
kick papa every night?

30
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:51,761
I also whack people with silly questions.

31
00:03:56,053 --> 00:03:57,469
Finish your lunch.

32
00:04:01,011 --> 00:04:02,719
Drive slowly.

33
00:04:02,803 --> 00:04:04,303
This bus doesn't go faster than a snail.

34
00:04:04,428 --> 00:04:06,094
-Adi...
-I know, mummy...

35
00:04:06,178 --> 00:04:08,553
I'll wash my hands before I eat.
I won't eat the canteen food.

36
00:04:08,636 --> 00:04:10,553
I won't eat fast.
I won't play in the mud.

37
00:04:10,636 --> 00:04:12,511
I'll come straight home
from school.

38
00:04:12,594 --> 00:04:14,636
-I love you.
-Okay.

39
00:04:14,886 --> 00:04:15,719
Your turn to say it.

40
00:04:16,553 --> 00:04:18,803
I love you, mummy.
Please go now.

41
00:04:19,011 --> 00:04:20,386
Move!

42
00:04:27,094 --> 00:04:29,219
Isn't your mom very hyper?

43
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:32,469
It's not her fault.
I was pre-term.

44
00:04:32,636 --> 00:04:34,553
So, the doctor took advantage
and scared her.

45
00:04:34,636 --> 00:04:37,344
-You're a weakling for sure.
-Want proof?

46
00:04:40,969 --> 00:04:42,219
Good morning, ma'am.

47
00:04:42,386 --> 00:04:44,678
-How are you, Neelam?
-Great!

48
00:04:45,011 --> 00:04:47,428
Enjoy. You're off
five minutes early today.

49
00:04:47,719 --> 00:04:49,594
Do you even issue tickets
to passengers

50
00:04:49,678 --> 00:04:51,511
or only speak to your girlfriends
all night?

51
00:04:51,594 --> 00:04:53,303
Girlfriend. Just one.

52
00:04:53,386 --> 00:04:54,886
I'm a one-woman man.

53
00:04:54,969 --> 00:04:56,094
Bye.

54
00:04:56,636 --> 00:04:58,094
I've messaged you.

55
00:04:58,178 --> 00:04:59,469
One to Itarsi.

56
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,594
What's for lunch?

57
00:05:21,803 --> 00:05:22,928
Hello.

58
00:05:28,386 --> 00:05:30,011
Look.

59
00:05:40,636 --> 00:05:46,344
We haven't eaten out in a while.
Shall we go?

60
00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:19,511
Yes?

61
00:07:19,678 --> 00:07:20,719
I was...

62
00:07:23,469 --> 00:07:25,969
Do you want something?

63
00:07:26,011 --> 00:07:26,928
No.

64
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,344
They did not recognize you?

65
00:07:37,719 --> 00:07:39,636
Who recognizes a kabaddi player?

66
00:08:25,678 --> 00:08:26,553
Hello.

67
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:28,594
Adi, why weren't you
answering the phone?

68
00:08:28,886 --> 00:08:31,428
I was in the toilet, mummy.
I needed to pee.

69
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,678
Couldn't you talk to me first?

70
00:08:33,844 --> 00:08:36,386
Mummy, the dam would've burst
in two minutes.

71
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:38,303
It would've flooded the house.

72
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:40,428
You know I get stressed.

73
00:08:40,511 --> 00:08:43,678
Why?

74
00:08:43,928 --> 00:08:46,136
When I'm late from school.

75
00:08:46,178 --> 00:08:48,344
When I eat less for lunch.

76
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:50,678
When I sneeze
more than twice in row.

77
00:08:50,761 --> 00:08:52,928
What can this little child do?

78
00:08:53,386 --> 00:08:56,511
God has made me both,
poor and helpless.

79
00:08:56,755 --> 00:08:58,178
Can I help that?

80
00:08:58,896 --> 00:09:01,466
But you can.
By giving me a mobile phone.

81
00:09:01,693 --> 00:09:03,583
Just say yes, mummy.

82
00:09:03,724 --> 00:09:04,521
Homework done?

83
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:05,545
Bye.

84
00:09:15,962 --> 00:09:19,129
Papa, I'm the big daddy
of this game.

85
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:21,379
Wait.
I'll prove you wrong.

86
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,420
Take that!

87
00:09:26,295 --> 00:09:28,129
You were saying?
Who's the daddy?

88
00:09:28,337 --> 00:09:30,212
Son, the biggest daddy
is your papa.

89
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:42,045
There are games on every sport.
Why don't they make one on kabaddi.

90
00:09:42,212 --> 00:09:46,087
Even if there was one,
who would play it?

91
00:09:51,545 --> 00:09:55,295
Son, never joke
about three things.

92
00:09:55,504 --> 00:09:58,004
You, me and kabaddi.

93
00:09:58,545 --> 00:09:59,712
Your turn.

94
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,712
Sure, I'll talk
to the gaming industry

95
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:07,587
to make the hottest game
on kabaddi.

96
00:10:08,504 --> 00:10:10,004
Would you like a shoe?

97
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,295
He says he'll have anything
you're serving.

98
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,420
Anything's better than her kicks.

99
00:10:23,212 --> 00:10:24,420
Bam!

100
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:32,462
What's the gossip on your school
moms' WhatsApp group?

101
00:10:32,629 --> 00:10:36,004
Rihaan's mother is worried
about his English grammar lesson.

102
00:10:36,087 --> 00:10:40,504
Smriti's mother is ecstatic.
Her child topped the Math Olympiad.

103
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,125
Charts on living and non-living things
is needed for Monday.

104
00:10:43,295 --> 00:10:44,670
Leave it. I am so bored.

105
00:10:50,045 --> 00:10:51,379
Who's calling?

106
00:10:51,712 --> 00:10:52,587
Meenu.

107
00:10:52,795 --> 00:10:53,545
Meenu!

108
00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:56,629
I'll tell her you are bored
and don't want to talk.

109
00:10:56,712 --> 00:10:58,462
-Wait.
-Prashant!

110
00:10:59,754 --> 00:11:01,462
You can't do anything
without a beating.

111
00:11:01,837 --> 00:11:04,045
-Hello.
-How are you, my love?

112
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,337
Will you fill the empty spot
in my heart?

113
00:11:06,587 --> 00:11:09,129
I'm coming to brighten up
your sleepy town.

114
00:11:09,337 --> 00:11:13,337
-Prepare a grand welcome.
-Are you coming to Bhopal?

115
00:11:13,462 --> 00:11:16,545
-To meet a prospective boy?
-Not a boy... but some girls.

116
00:11:17,087 --> 00:11:19,087
I knew you swung the other way.

117
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,212
Shut up!

118
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:24,504
Duggal sir and I are shifting to Bhopal
to represent the association there.

119
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,462
To look for fresh kabaddi talent.

120
00:11:26,795 --> 00:11:29,212
Can't you see her ankle?

121
00:11:29,837 --> 00:11:31,254
Why aren't you grabbing it?

122
00:11:31,412 --> 00:11:33,454
Afraid to break a nail?

123
00:11:34,087 --> 00:11:35,420
What was I saying?

124
00:11:35,504 --> 00:11:37,212
I miss you terribly.

125
00:11:37,672 --> 00:11:39,422
You and our glory days.

126
00:11:39,629 --> 00:11:42,837
-So, let's meet on Sunday.
-Sunday is Adi's...

127
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,462
The husband can look after the child.
And God will look after the husband.

128
00:11:46,504 --> 00:11:48,754
I'm not listening to any excuses.

129
00:11:49,004 --> 00:11:51,045
Or I'll come to your house
and kidnap you.

130
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:52,524
Bye for now!

131
00:11:52,698 --> 00:11:53,989
Later, alligator!

132
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,295
Mummy, are you going somewhere?

133
00:12:25,795 --> 00:12:28,420
Who will help me
with the spell bee?

134
00:12:28,754 --> 00:12:29,670
I will.

135
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:30,879
Okay.

136
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:33,644
Bye.

137
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:35,254
You're looking very cute.

138
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,212
Where's mummy going
on a Sunday?

139
00:12:37,254 --> 00:12:41,462
Son, I told you mummy's
touchy about three things...

140
00:12:41,942 --> 00:12:43,859
You, me and...?

141
00:12:44,021 --> 00:12:45,021
Kabaddi.

142
00:12:47,274 --> 00:12:48,316
What's this?

143
00:12:48,379 --> 00:12:49,629
Baulk line.

144
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,545
Don't Bhopal girls have any power?

145
00:12:52,962 --> 00:12:55,045
-What's this?
-Bonus line.

146
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:56,045
Very good.

147
00:12:56,129 --> 00:13:00,170
Your family will pressure you
to get married soon.

148
00:13:00,297 --> 00:13:02,005
They tried it with me, too.

149
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:05,876
But, this is the age for kabaddi...
for education.

150
00:13:06,084 --> 00:13:07,543
How will you get out
of the trap?

151
00:13:07,712 --> 00:13:12,545
Raiding in kabaddi
is like refusing a proposal.

152
00:13:12,754 --> 00:13:13,754
Shall I show you?

153
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,879
Let's go.

154
00:13:16,305 --> 00:13:19,763
Cross the baulk line
and affirm your stand.

155
00:13:20,536 --> 00:13:22,745
Make a shy entry.

156
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:26,557
And on the bonus line,
get the point.

157
00:13:26,837 --> 00:13:28,504
Now, you're in the game.

158
00:13:28,712 --> 00:13:32,754
Now, you can claim dibs
on any member of the guy's side.

159
00:13:33,004 --> 00:13:37,754
His uncle will try to befriend you.

160
00:13:38,004 --> 00:13:40,504
But they really want
to grab you under this guise.

161
00:13:40,712 --> 00:13:42,879
For instance, she tries to catch me.

162
00:13:43,712 --> 00:13:45,545
She's got my ankle.
What shall I do?

163
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:52,670
I'll free my ankle, use the lobby area
and return to my end line.

164
00:13:52,837 --> 00:13:53,962
Got it?

165
00:13:54,628 --> 00:13:57,044
Girls, warm up. I'll be back.

166
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,004
Start.

167
00:14:01,004 --> 00:14:02,254
Jaya.

168
00:14:02,462 --> 00:14:04,545
Welcome to the City of Lakes.

169
00:14:06,087 --> 00:14:07,629
You have a garden now.

170
00:14:07,712 --> 00:14:10,337
I don't play kabaddi anymore.
Got to do something with my time.

171
00:14:10,462 --> 00:14:13,420
I can't believe it has been 7-8 years
since we played competitively.

172
00:14:13,545 --> 00:14:16,545
I haven't played kabaddi
since seven years and two months!

173
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:21,879
Did you know that I requested the team
to hold your spot for an entire year?

174
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:24,170
I thought you'd make a comeback.

175
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,420
You know Adi's health.

176
00:14:26,555 --> 00:14:28,763
Then, Prashant got transferred
to Bhopal.

177
00:14:29,004 --> 00:14:30,712
I got so involved in being
a home-maker

178
00:14:30,795 --> 00:14:32,587
that I could never return
to professional sport.

179
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:37,004
Truthfully, I'm involved with kabaddi
to give the team

180
00:14:37,087 --> 00:14:39,337
a national player like Jaya Nigam.

181
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:42,920
-You've never complimented me before.
-Honest truth.

182
00:14:43,754 --> 00:14:46,795
But, seeing Bhopal's talent,
it seems tough.

183
00:14:46,962 --> 00:14:50,087
-You're quite the motivational coach.
-I'll introduce you to the girls.

184
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:53,391
Line up, girls.

185
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,458
On the double.

186
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,087
Do you know who she is?

187
00:14:59,295 --> 00:15:00,795
Jaya Nigam.

188
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:03,337
India captain, 2010.

189
00:15:03,504 --> 00:15:05,712
And the best raider to date.

190
00:15:05,847 --> 00:15:07,097
Take her blessings.

191
00:15:07,587 --> 00:15:09,837
And give me 50 rupees.

192
00:15:10,337 --> 00:15:11,837
How about a quick match?

193
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,754
I'm very rusty.
I won't be able to raid.

194
00:15:14,962 --> 00:15:17,254
You guys practice.
We'll raid the snack bar, instead.

195
00:15:17,337 --> 00:15:18,170
Snack bar?

196
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,337
We're in the canteen.
Continue with your practice.

197
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,962
Preeti, take over.

198
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,462
I'm watching even from outside.

199
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,254
Adi...

200
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:45,129
Is it true that if a pizza
isn't delivered in 25 minutes, it's free?

201
00:15:45,504 --> 00:15:48,920
-I don't know. Why?
-Fine. We'll find out today.

202
00:15:49,254 --> 00:15:50,587
Adi. Hello?

203
00:16:25,754 --> 00:16:27,712
The pizza gave you a free bug, didn't it?

204
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,879
You get ready. I'll handle this.

205
00:16:34,253 --> 00:16:36,086
There are two slices from last evening.
Would you like some?

206
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:37,962
Sorry, mum...

207
00:16:43,841 --> 00:16:46,800
Prashant, we'll have to take Adi
to the doctor.

208
00:16:47,254 --> 00:16:48,587
I'll take him.

209
00:16:49,004 --> 00:16:51,712
No. I'll take him.
Drop us on your way to work.

210
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,879
Alright.

211
00:16:58,422 --> 00:16:59,922
Adi, open your mouth.

212
00:17:01,376 --> 00:17:02,584
Say, 'Aah'.

213
00:17:10,587 --> 00:17:12,545
Your tummy's as small as an ant.

214
00:17:12,629 --> 00:17:14,629
But, you want to stuff yourself
like an elephant.

215
00:17:14,707 --> 00:17:16,957
There's bound to be an overflow.

216
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,395
Get up.

217
00:17:19,629 --> 00:17:20,670
Come, sit.

218
00:17:26,643 --> 00:17:29,059
Generally kids of his age
can handle junk food.

219
00:17:29,337 --> 00:17:32,420
But, you know his immunity.

220
00:17:32,587 --> 00:17:36,087
Doctor, he doesn't listen.
Prashant and he only want take-out.

221
00:17:37,587 --> 00:17:41,587
You've troubled your mummy.
Now it's payback... medicine time.

222
00:17:46,289 --> 00:17:47,872
He should settle by tomorrow.

223
00:17:55,504 --> 00:17:56,545
Mrs Pandey!

224
00:17:56,795 --> 00:17:58,379
Jaya, come in.

225
00:17:58,587 --> 00:17:59,879
I'm late for office.

226
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:01,312
What happened?

227
00:18:01,337 --> 00:18:03,129
He's been vomiting since morning.

228
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,212
I'll watch him.

229
00:18:06,566 --> 00:18:07,982
Please give him these pills
after lunch.

230
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:09,212
Adi, take it.

231
00:18:10,295 --> 00:18:12,004
Will he have lentil rice
for lunch?

232
00:18:12,087 --> 00:18:13,087
Absolutely.

233
00:18:13,254 --> 00:18:14,629
With pickle!

234
00:18:16,545 --> 00:18:17,962
Don't trouble her.
Bye.

235
00:18:18,045 --> 00:18:18,879
Okay.

236
00:18:19,962 --> 00:18:22,045
Lentil rice with pickle?

237
00:18:22,337 --> 00:18:24,879
Get better and I'll get you a tub
of ice cream.

238
00:18:31,795 --> 00:18:34,170
The vomiting has stopped.
I gave him the medication.

239
00:18:34,254 --> 00:18:34,962
Yes.

240
00:18:35,504 --> 00:18:37,587
I'll check on him in a bit.
I'm in the office.

241
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:38,587
I'll call.

242
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,254
Rupal, is everything okay?

243
00:18:40,337 --> 00:18:42,587
He's been asking for you
since the morning.

244
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,462
Greetings, sir.

245
00:18:51,712 --> 00:18:53,212
You asked for me?

246
00:18:53,712 --> 00:18:56,087
So... you've finally found the time.

247
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:00,337
Do you realise how inconvenient it is
for passengers

248
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,629
if one counter remains closed
for an hour?

249
00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:06,309
Where were you?

250
00:19:08,837 --> 00:19:11,629
Sir, my son was sick.
I took him to the hospital.

251
00:19:12,004 --> 00:19:15,420
Jaya, gone are the days
you represented the Railways in kabaddi.

252
00:19:15,683 --> 00:19:17,974
You're a regular employee now.

253
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:21,519
If you want a day off,
you have to apply for it

254
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:24,462
or you can say goodbye to this job.

255
00:19:24,754 --> 00:19:27,920
Get this into your thick athletic head
as quickly as possible.

256
00:19:29,379 --> 00:19:30,379
Yes, sir.

257
00:19:32,586 --> 00:19:37,544
Since you're late by an hour,
you will stay back for two.

258
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,170
-Has Adi gone to sleep?
-Yes.

259
00:20:21,629 --> 00:20:22,920
Without speaking to me?

260
00:20:23,129 --> 00:20:25,837
He's sleeping, but I'm awake.

261
00:20:26,129 --> 00:20:27,295
Speak to me.

262
00:20:34,712 --> 00:20:37,379
There was a time
when I could walk in and out

263
00:20:37,712 --> 00:20:39,962
whenever I pleased
and still got applauded.

264
00:20:40,701 --> 00:20:44,035
Today I was late by an hour
and the boss hurled a string of insults.

265
00:20:45,504 --> 00:20:50,504
When a person's circumstances change,
so does people's attitude.

266
00:20:50,837 --> 00:20:52,629
I haven't changed.

267
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:55,837
You were a dodo before
and will always remain one.

268
00:20:56,242 --> 00:20:59,034
Madam, this flightless bird
was blinded by your love.

269
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:01,462
Else, there are other beauties in line.

270
00:21:02,504 --> 00:21:05,920
Where is the line?
I can't see them.

271
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:13,045
-Forget it.
-Have you seen your belly?

272
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:14,337
No.

273
00:21:14,587 --> 00:21:16,920
-Pot-bellied oldie!
-Feed me less.

274
00:21:17,587 --> 00:21:20,045
-It's your fault.
-Stop eating so much.

275
00:21:30,837 --> 00:21:33,587
Mummy, I think I'm in better shape now.

276
00:21:33,879 --> 00:21:35,462
No junk food.

277
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:37,545
Come on, mummy!
Think beyond food.

278
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:40,587
Thursday is my sports day.
Can I participate in the race?

279
00:21:42,254 --> 00:21:45,295
One race. 100 metres only.

280
00:21:45,379 --> 00:21:49,795
With my force adding to the wind's,
I have full chances of coming third.

281
00:21:56,587 --> 00:21:58,170
Papa has agreed.

282
00:22:00,879 --> 00:22:01,837
Fine.

283
00:22:02,004 --> 00:22:03,212
Thank you, mummy.

284
00:22:04,292 --> 00:22:07,458
Babloo, I'm participating
in the race, too.

285
00:22:07,629 --> 00:22:09,212
Just one race for now.

286
00:22:09,254 --> 00:22:12,087
You see I want to concentrate
only on one race...

287
00:22:12,337 --> 00:22:16,004
What can the poor boy do?
Sports is in his blood.

288
00:22:21,469 --> 00:22:24,510
Come early or you won't get to sit
in the front row.

289
00:22:26,302 --> 00:22:27,427
All the best.

290
00:22:27,594 --> 00:22:28,760
Thank you.

291
00:22:31,219 --> 00:22:32,969
He was livid the last time
I was late.

292
00:22:33,094 --> 00:22:34,760
He won't spare me this time
if I ask for half a day off.

293
00:22:35,094 --> 00:22:37,469
Why can't school
host sports day on Sunday?

294
00:22:37,802 --> 00:22:38,844
What will you do now?

295
00:22:40,385 --> 00:22:42,969
Adi will be heartbroken
if you don't come.

296
00:22:43,594 --> 00:22:44,552
I'll try.

297
00:22:45,427 --> 00:22:46,677
Okay, bye.

298
00:22:47,385 --> 00:22:48,052
Bye.

299
00:23:00,052 --> 00:23:02,260
Javed, how's the boss' mood?

300
00:23:02,344 --> 00:23:04,177
Explosive as ever.

301
00:23:09,052 --> 00:23:10,885
Final round - 100 metres.

302
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:13,427
Tanuj Chandra from Yellow House.

303
00:23:13,469 --> 00:23:15,469
Adi Sachdeva from Green House.

304
00:23:15,635 --> 00:23:16,969
Balwinder Singh from Red House.

305
00:23:17,052 --> 00:23:18,969
Daksh Mittal from Blue House.

306
00:23:22,844 --> 00:23:25,135
Get set... go!

307
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,510
Come on, Adi.
Run!

308
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,552
Come on, Adi.

309
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,302
Yay!

310
00:23:39,927 --> 00:23:41,219
Well done.

311
00:23:54,552 --> 00:23:58,094
I can't believe that Adi came third
and I missed it.

312
00:23:58,677 --> 00:23:59,969
It's alright.

313
00:24:00,219 --> 00:24:01,302
Is he still angry?

314
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,552
Yes, he is.

315
00:24:04,677 --> 00:24:06,719
Don't worry.  Come home.
We'll pacify him.

316
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,010
Alright.

317
00:24:08,635 --> 00:24:09,552
Bye.

318
00:24:22,844 --> 00:24:26,219
Adi, you came third!

319
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,552
Prashant.

320
00:24:31,427 --> 00:24:32,927
I saw the photographs.

321
00:24:33,135 --> 00:24:34,719
You were so good.

322
00:24:35,844 --> 00:24:36,844
Adi!

323
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:41,010
I've brought you games.

324
00:24:41,177 --> 00:24:43,344
You never came.

325
00:24:50,927 --> 00:24:52,010
Sorry.

326
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:54,177
I got stuck at work.

327
00:24:54,344 --> 00:24:58,052
Would the trains stop running
if you had left, mummy?

328
00:24:58,135 --> 00:25:00,969
Everyone's mums were there.
Even Rihaan's.

329
00:25:01,135 --> 00:25:03,677
Daksh's mother came
half hour earlier.

330
00:25:03,844 --> 00:25:05,969
Your job isn't even that important.

331
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:09,135
You're just a ticket-teller.
And you couldn't leave?

332
00:25:28,344 --> 00:25:29,427
Prashant...

333
00:25:31,469 --> 00:25:33,510
where did I go wrong?

334
00:25:35,052 --> 00:25:36,760
What did I not do right?

335
00:25:38,427 --> 00:25:40,094
Am I not a good mother?

336
00:25:40,344 --> 00:25:41,844
Jaya, it isn't like that.

337
00:25:42,885 --> 00:25:46,427
Did you hear how Adi spoke to me.

338
00:25:46,719 --> 00:25:48,760
He's a child.
He is angry.

339
00:25:50,677 --> 00:25:53,260
Does being a child give him the right
to speak anyway he pleases?

340
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,719
And instead of correcting him,
you're pacifying me.

341
00:25:59,385 --> 00:26:01,594
Is it solely my responsibility
to understand everyone?

342
00:26:02,344 --> 00:26:05,969
Adi, you, the boss...

343
00:26:06,135 --> 00:26:08,677
And no one tries to understand me?

344
00:26:11,177 --> 00:26:13,302
Prashant, what opportunities I had

345
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,844
and look at what I'm doing?

346
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,177
You think mummy
doesn't do anything important.

347
00:27:01,094 --> 00:27:05,010
But, do you know what's the most
important job in this world?

348
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,594
A mother's.

349
00:27:11,052 --> 00:27:13,802
Your mother had many options.

350
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:19,427
But, she sacrificed it all
for two people.

351
00:27:19,635 --> 00:27:20,635
For whom?

352
00:27:24,385 --> 00:27:25,427
Us.

353
00:27:28,677 --> 00:27:32,094
You know your mother
since seven years.

354
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:36,302
But, I know her for 10.

355
00:27:38,025 --> 00:27:40,692
You know her as she is now.

356
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:46,135
I've known her
of how she was then.

357
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,344
Kabaddi...

358
00:28:06,594 --> 00:28:08,760
4 points, Northern Railway.

359
00:28:14,094 --> 00:28:15,094
Bye.

360
00:28:18,385 --> 00:28:19,469
Jaya, ready?

361
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:25,552
Let her enter.

362
00:28:27,802 --> 00:28:29,677
Don't let her get away.

363
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,802
2 points, Northern Railways.

364
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,802
Jaya Nigam.

365
00:28:44,408 --> 00:28:45,992
Reetu Negi.

366
00:28:49,484 --> 00:28:49,984
Yes!

367
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:54,414
Meenu said that there were many
kabaddi players but only one Jaya.

368
00:28:55,664 --> 00:28:58,330
Through kabaddi Jaya got a job
in the railways.

369
00:28:58,407 --> 00:28:59,907
And through the railways we met.

370
00:29:00,719 --> 00:29:01,430
-Hello.
-Mayank.

371
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:02,071
Jaya.

372
00:29:02,406 --> 00:29:02,946
Prashant.

373
00:29:03,071 --> 00:29:04,071
Jaya.

374
00:29:11,155 --> 00:29:12,821
I'm getting some tea.
Want some?

375
00:29:13,113 --> 00:29:14,113
Yes, okay.

376
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:29,321
I'm not free now.
I have practice till seven.

377
00:29:29,405 --> 00:29:31,571
-Book tickets for the night show.
-Fine.

378
00:29:34,571 --> 00:29:37,696
-Will your mother agree?
-His secure government job will win her.

379
00:29:39,398 --> 00:29:40,398
Prashant.

380
00:29:42,938 --> 00:29:44,813
This is my best friend Meenu.

381
00:29:44,838 --> 00:29:46,755
And this is Prashant. My...

382
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:48,819
Your?

383
00:29:54,072 --> 00:29:55,197
Shall we go?

384
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,114
Yes.

385
00:30:11,239 --> 00:30:13,905
Jaya, you play fabulously.
You're so fit.

386
00:30:13,947 --> 00:30:17,572
Seeing you play
I've started loving the game.

387
00:31:32,572 --> 00:31:34,114
Mother, this is Prashant.
He's an engineer.

388
00:31:34,197 --> 00:31:36,405
He works with the Railways.
He makes a good living.

389
00:31:36,489 --> 00:31:37,739
He'll keep me very happy.

390
00:31:37,822 --> 00:31:39,780
Will he let you play kabaddi
after marriage?

391
00:31:40,489 --> 00:31:41,864
-Yes.
-Yes.

392
00:31:43,655 --> 00:31:44,697
Right.

393
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:12,822
Hello.

394
00:32:13,322 --> 00:32:15,530
You're so lucky.

395
00:32:15,989 --> 00:32:18,239
Your husband allows you to play
even after marriage.

396
00:32:18,322 --> 00:32:20,780
I don't need Prashant's permission
for anything.

397
00:32:20,864 --> 00:32:22,739
Very lucky. Let's go.

398
00:32:35,197 --> 00:32:36,405
Come on, Jaya.

399
00:32:42,364 --> 00:32:44,405
That's my wife. Mine!

400
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,572
Stop.

401
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:49,489
Romeo, don't get so excited.

402
00:32:49,739 --> 00:32:52,030
Juliet, concentrate.

403
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,489
Come on, Jaya.

404
00:33:00,449 --> 00:33:02,157
Prashant, your favourite aubergine.

405
00:33:04,822 --> 00:33:06,905
Give him some more.
Don't you love aubergine?

406
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,447
Mummy's made it,
specially for you.

407
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:09,655
That's true.

408
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:29,706
A Volkswagon Polo for all-rounder, Jaya Nigam!

409
00:33:59,066 --> 00:34:01,524
-May I come in, sir?
-Yes, Jaya, come.

410
00:34:03,524 --> 00:34:04,899
-How are you?
-Very well.

411
00:34:08,857 --> 00:34:12,149
A player gets to play for herself
or her team.

412
00:34:12,807 --> 00:34:18,482
Only a few chosen ones get a chance
to play for their country

413
00:34:19,695 --> 00:34:23,778
and truly shine as a sports champion.

414
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:28,348
There's only one-and-a-half year left
for the Asia Kabaddi Championship.

415
00:34:28,999 --> 00:34:30,707
The country wants this cup.

416
00:34:31,082 --> 00:34:32,666
Congratulations.

417
00:34:37,102 --> 00:34:39,144
Sir! Thank you, sir.

418
00:34:47,097 --> 00:34:49,056
Jaya, what happened?

419
00:34:49,264 --> 00:34:53,112
Are you okay?

420
00:34:54,722 --> 00:34:58,014
Chandni Chowk street food
is no longer the same quality.

421
00:34:58,264 --> 00:34:59,139
Jaya?

422
00:35:00,863 --> 00:35:02,322
It's not the food.

423
00:35:02,347 --> 00:35:03,431
It's you!

424
00:35:03,597 --> 00:35:05,097
I'm pregnant, you fool!

425
00:35:08,931 --> 00:35:10,431
Mummy, I'm in the hospital.

426
00:35:10,722 --> 00:35:12,597
Get ready to become a grandma.

427
00:35:13,097 --> 00:35:14,097
What!

428
00:35:16,222 --> 00:35:17,389
Seriously?

429
00:35:17,636 --> 00:35:23,345
So now it's time for you
to say goodbye to kabaddi.

430
00:35:23,595 --> 00:35:24,928
That will never happen.

431
00:35:25,444 --> 00:35:26,444
Let's see.

432
00:35:31,576 --> 00:35:33,701
Baby is playing kabaddi kabaddi?

433
00:35:35,931 --> 00:35:36,806
Hello, sir.

434
00:35:36,889 --> 00:35:38,222
Hello, Jaya.
How are you?

435
00:35:38,306 --> 00:35:39,306
Fine, sir.

436
00:35:39,389 --> 00:35:42,597
I'll have the baby in two months
and I'll return to kabaddi in six.

437
00:35:42,764 --> 00:35:43,972
Prashant's very helpful.

438
00:35:44,139 --> 00:35:46,264
He wants me to continue playing.

439
00:35:46,764 --> 00:35:48,597
Let's see. Take care.

440
00:35:49,222 --> 00:35:50,472
Thank you, sir.

441
00:36:12,597 --> 00:36:15,056
There's no complication.

442
00:36:15,181 --> 00:36:18,972
We had kept the baby in the NICU
for precautionary reasons.

443
00:36:19,139 --> 00:36:21,222
He was born very weak

444
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:22,889
and was little underweight.

445
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:25,681
His oxygen concentration
was also low.

446
00:36:26,972 --> 00:36:30,139
You will have to be careful with
the baby for a couple of things.

447
00:36:31,181 --> 00:36:33,181
His immunity is not upto the mark.

448
00:36:33,972 --> 00:36:36,639
And because of that,
he may be prone

449
00:36:36,722 --> 00:36:38,431
to fever and coughs frequently.

450
00:36:39,763 --> 00:36:42,680
He'll take some time to gain immunity.

451
00:36:44,264 --> 00:36:46,889
And you'll have to be patient.

452
00:36:48,056 --> 00:36:51,972
Someone will have to
constantly be around.

453
00:36:53,139 --> 00:36:55,139
Take care of him.

454
00:36:56,972 --> 00:36:59,056
Doctor... Jaya... I will be back.

455
00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:05,431
Who'll take care of you?

456
00:37:06,931 --> 00:37:07,931
Mumma.

457
00:37:09,722 --> 00:37:11,389
Who'll make you strong?

458
00:37:12,847 --> 00:37:13,847
Mumma.

459
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:33,806
Mumma gave up
her first love for us.

460
00:37:35,472 --> 00:37:38,806
Even if we thank her everyday,
it's not enough.

461
00:38:05,972 --> 00:38:07,681
Sorry, mumma.

462
00:38:09,722 --> 00:38:10,931
Adi.

463
00:38:32,556 --> 00:38:33,972
How old is mummy?

464
00:38:34,139 --> 00:38:35,181
Why?

465
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,722
Tell me.

466
00:38:38,889 --> 00:38:39,931
Eat.

467
00:38:41,472 --> 00:38:42,556
Thirty two.

468
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:44,972
Can't a player
make a comeback at 32?

469
00:39:03,306 --> 00:39:05,264
Have you heard of Serena Williams?

470
00:39:05,431 --> 00:39:08,556
Mother of a child
and queen of tennis.

471
00:39:13,967 --> 00:39:17,009
If you want her to make a comeback,
you must convince her.

472
00:39:17,318 --> 00:39:19,943
Why are you shooting off my shoulder?

473
00:39:20,389 --> 00:39:22,306
You're avoiding the topic

474
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:25,306
and it'll catch up with you again.

475
00:39:25,931 --> 00:39:27,389
Come now, sit.

476
00:39:34,722 --> 00:39:35,681
Roger Federer.

477
00:39:35,764 --> 00:39:38,181
He's getting more agile
with age.

478
00:39:38,306 --> 00:39:41,014
Your mother huffs after climbing
the stairs for five minutes.

479
00:39:41,181 --> 00:39:43,681
How will she manage
two 15-minute halves?

480
00:39:49,222 --> 00:39:51,139
Tiger Woods. Michael Jordan.
Yuvraj Singh.

481
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,306
Petr Cech. Muhammad Ali.

482
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:53,389
No.

483
00:39:56,306 --> 00:39:58,431
-It's your fault.
-How?

484
00:39:58,597 --> 00:40:00,431
You should've taken the responsibility
of looking after me.

485
00:40:00,745 --> 00:40:02,722
Mummy must have got emotional
and said,

486
00:40:02,806 --> 00:40:04,806
"Baby, I'll take care of you."

487
00:40:05,014 --> 00:40:08,972
You could've said, "Jaya,
I'll take responsibility for our son."

488
00:40:09,097 --> 00:40:10,472
You failed to make the score.

489
00:40:10,681 --> 00:40:14,764
A little support from you
and mummy would've still been playing.

490
00:40:15,181 --> 00:40:17,889
Why are you
making me feel guilty?

491
00:40:18,409 --> 00:40:20,625
Children are God-like.
We never lie.

492
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:22,651
You've sinned.

493
00:40:22,802 --> 00:40:24,802
I'm giving you a chance to atone.

494
00:40:25,175 --> 00:40:26,675
Think about it.

495
00:40:27,097 --> 00:40:28,597
That should be all.

496
00:40:38,084 --> 00:40:39,376
Me and comeback?

497
00:40:39,739 --> 00:40:41,114
Listen carefully.

498
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:43,264
I'm asking you to fake an attempt.

499
00:40:43,514 --> 00:40:46,485
Prashant, neither is my gait
nor my weight kabaddi ready.

500
00:40:46,657 --> 00:40:49,990
Try for a month
and say that you can't do it.

501
00:40:50,651 --> 00:40:55,443
He'll be happy seeing you try.

502
00:40:57,759 --> 00:41:00,759
Please! Adi's hounding me.

503
00:41:01,306 --> 00:41:02,306
Please?

504
00:41:02,837 --> 00:41:04,003
How is it possible?

505
00:41:04,917 --> 00:41:08,584
With a little bit of truth
and a lot of lies.

506
00:41:09,056 --> 00:41:12,847
You want me to go back to kabaddi
for the very people I left it for.

507
00:41:13,878 --> 00:41:16,212
Why can't anything in my life
be normal?

508
00:41:16,847 --> 00:41:17,764
I am.

509
00:41:19,222 --> 00:41:21,406
Am I not normal?

510
00:41:21,431 --> 00:41:22,556
No way!

511
00:41:22,827 --> 00:41:25,170
I get kicked by my wife
everyday. Isn't that normal?

512
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:31,529
It's done.

513
00:41:32,139 --> 00:41:36,722
Papa, I respect you a little more now.

514
00:41:40,556 --> 00:41:42,931
Mummy, wake up.

515
00:41:50,347 --> 00:41:51,306
Adi.

516
00:41:52,056 --> 00:41:53,639
Get up!

517
00:41:53,806 --> 00:41:55,014
You get up, too.

518
00:42:26,306 --> 00:42:29,139
Adi's homework must've kept her up.

519
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:33,722
This doesn't look like a child's homework.

520
00:42:54,556 --> 00:42:57,389
No one will ever believe
you were a kabaddi champ.

521
00:43:04,431 --> 00:43:06,142
And you've to go to office, too.

522
00:43:11,764 --> 00:43:13,264
This is all you'll get today.

523
00:43:13,431 --> 00:43:15,306
You can order take-out.

524
00:43:17,931 --> 00:43:19,889
Adi, eat these.

525
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:23,597
Even Bhopal's slowest train
is faster than you.

526
00:43:34,472 --> 00:43:37,681
Drink up.
You've to build your strength.

527
00:43:38,097 --> 00:43:39,764
It should go in one gulp.

528
00:43:48,972 --> 00:43:50,722
Move!

529
00:43:57,389 --> 00:43:59,181
It's not that I miss kabaddi.

530
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,730
I'm doing this for Adi.

531
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:04,181
If I'll come to your club,
he'll think that I'm practicing.

532
00:44:05,739 --> 00:44:07,697
My legs aren't
kabaddi-friendly anymore.

533
00:44:07,722 --> 00:44:09,294
I can barely handle a morning walk.

534
00:44:09,389 --> 00:44:13,181
You didn't take long to turn those
deer-like legs into tortoise legs.

535
00:44:13,681 --> 00:44:17,056
And when will you change?

536
00:44:17,556 --> 00:44:19,472
You'll are snacking here?

537
00:44:20,264 --> 00:44:22,514
Push harder.
Don't you have any strength?

538
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:24,389
Come on.

539
00:44:24,472 --> 00:44:25,972
Let's have some tea.

540
00:44:28,972 --> 00:44:31,347
Have you heard
of the Keto diet?

541
00:44:32,222 --> 00:44:35,181
This stops. Keto starts.

542
00:44:39,389 --> 00:44:40,889
I'll have this.

543
00:44:48,931 --> 00:44:50,931
The gym's nice.
Check it out.

544
00:45:09,472 --> 00:45:10,722
Get up!

545
00:45:12,389 --> 00:45:13,722
Prashant, wake up.

546
00:45:13,806 --> 00:45:15,639
I can't do it.
You go.

547
00:45:20,014 --> 00:45:21,931
Down slowly.

548
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:26,181
There's one advantage.

549
00:45:26,472 --> 00:45:28,097
I'm getting slimmer.

550
00:45:28,806 --> 00:45:30,056
That's great.

551
00:45:30,347 --> 00:45:31,972
My wife's getting hotter.

552
00:45:51,597 --> 00:45:54,514
Give me the ticket quickly.
I'll miss the train.

553
00:45:55,181 --> 00:45:56,847
Don't try and catch
a moving train.

554
00:45:56,931 --> 00:45:58,597
You need to be fit
to do so.

555
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:07,847
I'll see you.

556
00:46:22,847 --> 00:46:23,931
Want to play?

557
00:46:28,306 --> 00:46:30,389
Frightened of these kids?

558
00:46:45,431 --> 00:46:46,422
Kabaddi...

559
00:46:46,889 --> 00:46:49,097
Not "Kabaddi kabaddi." Say "Oldie oldie."

560
00:47:03,847 --> 00:47:07,347
She looks rusted from the outside
but strong from inside.

561
00:47:13,056 --> 00:47:16,347
Jaya, you lost badly to the girls.

562
00:48:04,764 --> 00:48:06,514
When are your selections?

563
00:48:35,432 --> 00:48:37,099
Rupal was late, too.

564
00:48:40,518 --> 00:48:44,102
Jaya, we agreed on this act
for a month. It's been two.

565
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:46,764
I know.

566
00:48:47,288 --> 00:48:50,704
The longer you continue this charade,
Adi's hopes will rise higher.

567
00:48:56,431 --> 00:48:57,431
Let's go.

568
00:49:22,014 --> 00:49:24,139
How's your training?

569
00:49:35,984 --> 00:49:37,818
What did Adi say?

570
00:49:38,806 --> 00:49:40,347
Don't worry.

571
00:49:42,167 --> 00:49:44,417
I'll speak to him tomorrow.

572
00:49:46,423 --> 00:49:48,298
I couldn't say anything.

573
00:49:50,056 --> 00:49:51,889
Why?

574
00:49:52,181 --> 00:49:55,431
The child thinks that you're really
going to make a comeback.

575
00:49:58,264 --> 00:50:03,556
Prashant, I feel immensely happy
when I see you.

576
00:50:05,472 --> 00:50:09,681
I also feel the same
when I see Adi.

577
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:14,626
But, when I see myself

578
00:50:18,764 --> 00:50:20,514
I don't feel anything.

579
00:50:24,806 --> 00:50:30,431
In the past few days I've felt
an inner spark of happiness once again.

580
00:50:32,056 --> 00:50:34,514
I don't want to let go
of this feeling so easily.

581
00:50:36,389 --> 00:50:39,681
I know it won't last long.

582
00:50:40,931 --> 00:50:46,847
But I also don't want to regret that
I didn't even try.

583
00:50:48,389 --> 00:50:50,722
You're joking, right?

584
00:50:51,389 --> 00:50:53,431
I'm not, Prashant.

585
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:58,847
Of late, I've been feeling
that I can make a comeback.

586
00:51:04,638 --> 00:51:06,763
I want to play kabaddi once again.

587
00:51:52,498 --> 00:51:54,998
What's wrong?
Where are you lost?

588
00:51:56,373 --> 00:51:57,790
Nowhere.

589
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:03,831
Is everything okay at home?

590
00:52:07,831 --> 00:52:10,081
We're going to be hit by a storm.

591
00:52:15,123 --> 00:52:16,373
You've lost it!

592
00:52:16,665 --> 00:52:19,831
When players retire
she wants to make a comeback!

593
00:52:19,915 --> 00:52:21,331
Mummy, why're you mumbling?

594
00:52:21,498 --> 00:52:22,873
I'm not asking for your support.

595
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,998
I'm not supporting you.

596
00:52:25,081 --> 00:52:26,998
I don't want it.

597
00:52:27,123 --> 00:52:29,123
You don't have it.

598
00:52:29,331 --> 00:52:31,498
-Sweets?
-I don't want it.

599
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:33,706
You won't get it.

600
00:52:33,998 --> 00:52:35,290
Move on, folks!

601
00:52:35,373 --> 00:52:36,290
Quiet.

602
00:52:37,748 --> 00:52:40,373
And I don't think anyone here
is supporting you.

603
00:52:43,873 --> 00:52:45,123
Isn't it, Prashant?

604
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:46,831
Actually, mummy...

605
00:52:46,956 --> 00:52:49,081
I think she's doing
the right thing.

606
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,540
She stopped living her dream
because of us.

607
00:52:54,873 --> 00:52:58,665
The least we can do is support her
to fulfil it now.

608
00:52:59,206 --> 00:53:00,581
Very good.

609
00:53:00,665 --> 00:53:03,415
Very good. All you mad people
support each other.

610
00:53:03,623 --> 00:53:06,998
I'm not getting involved in your madness
and ruining my life.

611
00:53:07,706 --> 00:53:08,831
Support, my foot.

612
00:53:08,915 --> 00:53:11,040
How much longer is grandma
going to live anyway?

613
00:53:11,123 --> 00:53:12,540
Do you want a whack?

614
00:53:15,706 --> 00:53:17,790
Jaya, call Meenu.

615
00:53:17,831 --> 00:53:20,456
-Has she ever listened to me?
-You forgot my favourite sweet?

616
00:53:20,557 --> 00:53:21,640
Why is this with sugar?

617
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:23,706
I had said, use jaggery.

618
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,623
Why are you grumbling?

619
00:53:25,706 --> 00:53:27,165
What's wrong with the sweets?

620
00:53:27,415 --> 00:53:29,665
My favourite ones, mummy.

621
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:31,498
The last batch was rotting away.

622
00:53:31,665 --> 00:53:33,831
I had to throw the entire jar away.

623
00:53:37,498 --> 00:53:40,456
Jaya, you think you can come back
into the Indian team

624
00:53:40,498 --> 00:53:43,331
because you won against
a bunch of girls from Bhopal?

625
00:53:44,665 --> 00:53:46,623
They're amateurs.

626
00:53:46,831 --> 00:53:48,581
They don't even shave their legs.

627
00:53:50,956 --> 00:53:54,498
And your real competitors are pros.

628
00:53:55,456 --> 00:53:57,290
How will you make a comeback?

629
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,831
I have to try.

630
00:54:00,706 --> 00:54:01,998
I have to challenge myself.

631
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:04,581
I'll at least be able to sleep in peace.

632
00:54:04,665 --> 00:54:06,956
Sleep over it. Please spare me.

633
00:54:12,665 --> 00:54:13,873
Do you remember this?

634
00:54:16,748 --> 00:54:19,540
2006. Best raider.

635
00:54:24,706 --> 00:54:28,290
North vs South Central
Inter-Railway final.

636
00:54:29,415 --> 00:54:31,415
We played so well!

637
00:54:35,456 --> 00:54:36,998
But, that was another lifetime.

638
00:54:41,581 --> 00:54:43,915
We killed the internationals, too.

639
00:54:46,123 --> 00:54:48,790
Nothing has really changed.

640
00:54:49,623 --> 00:54:51,373
I couldn't play without you then.

641
00:54:51,873 --> 00:54:53,665
Nor can I now.

642
00:54:58,706 --> 00:55:02,040
And you're as stubborn
as you were then.

643
00:55:05,331 --> 00:55:11,665
If you try to enter with these girls,
it'll take you forever.

644
00:55:12,081 --> 00:55:14,206
We don't have that luxury.

645
00:55:14,498 --> 00:55:17,790
Even today, the best way to enter
the Nationals team

646
00:55:17,956 --> 00:55:19,623
is through the Railway team.

647
00:55:20,081 --> 00:55:24,373
And for that,
you've to convince Duggal sir.

648
00:55:26,206 --> 00:55:29,160
And don't expect any brownie points
based on past performance.

649
00:55:29,484 --> 00:55:31,650
You've to prove yourself... again.

650
00:55:33,831 --> 00:55:34,831
Got it?

651
00:55:37,331 --> 00:55:39,441
The girl wants to challenge herself
once again!

652
00:55:57,123 --> 00:55:59,540
It's tough on the mat.
We used to play on mud.

653
00:55:59,623 --> 00:56:01,748
Stop whining!
You'll have to learn.

654
00:56:01,873 --> 00:56:02,665
Sir.

655
00:56:02,956 --> 00:56:04,748
-Greetings, sir.
-Greetings, Jaya.

656
00:56:04,998 --> 00:56:07,665
It's impossible to keep you away
from kabaddi.

657
00:56:08,623 --> 00:56:09,748
You're right, sir.

658
00:56:09,831 --> 00:56:11,331
-Are you ready?
-Yes, sir.

659
00:56:11,415 --> 00:56:13,748
-Let's go.
-Yes. Come on.

660
00:56:18,706 --> 00:56:20,498
Kabaddi...

661
00:56:32,706 --> 00:56:36,498
Without practice, the first thing
a player loses is agility.

662
00:57:05,748 --> 00:57:08,040
What do you think, Duggal sir?

663
00:57:08,665 --> 00:57:10,581
She slipped plus her leg twisted.

664
00:57:11,081 --> 00:57:15,498
She's used to mud. She'll gear up quickly
to play on the mat.

665
00:57:16,665 --> 00:57:19,665
She needs a major overhaul.

666
00:57:20,165 --> 00:57:23,873
Sir, one word from you
and there will be hope.

667
00:57:25,206 --> 00:57:30,623
She needs one spot in the Northern
or Central Railway team.

668
00:57:31,165 --> 00:57:32,790
Jaya's good.

669
00:57:33,248 --> 00:57:36,040
But not that good to get picked
for the Railway team.

670
00:57:37,123 --> 00:57:43,331
Northern, Central, South Central, Western
Railway all have seasoned players.

671
00:57:45,206 --> 00:57:47,165
She won't make it there.

672
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:51,290
Sir, please.

673
00:57:56,831 --> 00:57:58,623
Go for one more raid, Jaya.

674
00:58:01,998 --> 00:58:04,123
Kabaddi...

675
00:58:15,665 --> 00:58:18,540
The other girls may have agility.
But Jaya uses strategy.

676
00:58:18,873 --> 00:58:20,706
She plays with presence of mind.

677
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,331
She should get a spot on the team.

678
00:58:24,456 --> 00:58:27,123
Duggal sir, what should I do?

679
00:58:32,873 --> 00:58:35,706
Something can be managed
in the Eastern Railway team.

680
00:58:36,123 --> 00:58:37,581
It's a new team.

681
00:58:37,748 --> 00:58:40,040
The coach wants to make a good team.

682
00:58:40,831 --> 00:58:44,123
He's touring the country
to find talent.

683
00:58:45,456 --> 00:58:48,706
He's currently in Mumbai
making selections.

684
00:58:49,373 --> 00:58:50,831
I can talk to him.

685
00:58:53,956 --> 00:58:56,873
Jaya, I can only recommend you.

686
00:58:57,706 --> 00:59:00,040
The rest depends
on how you play the game.

687
00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:02,956
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you, sir.

688
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:05,915
Jaya, you'll have to go to Mumbai.

689
00:59:17,456 --> 00:59:19,373
At least we got to see Mumbai.

690
00:59:20,248 --> 00:59:22,206
Let it not just end up as a city-tour.

691
00:59:22,415 --> 00:59:25,123
This is your only chance
towards a comeback.

692
00:59:25,706 --> 00:59:28,956
You lack speed.

693
00:59:29,581 --> 00:59:32,098
Make your brain work double time
to make up for it.

694
00:59:34,123 --> 00:59:35,290
Prashant.

695
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:38,248
Is he your husband or a boyfriend?

696
00:59:38,581 --> 00:59:40,873
Does any husband call his wife
so many times?

697
00:59:41,873 --> 00:59:42,873
Go ahead!

698
00:59:43,873 --> 00:59:44,748
Prashant?

699
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:46,540
Jaya, you reached?

700
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:47,665
Yes.

701
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:50,463
It's a big day.
Put your best foot forward.

702
00:59:51,790 --> 00:59:53,080
I'm a little nervous.

703
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:56,674
There's neither a kabaddi player
like you nor will there ever be.

704
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:58,123
Play confidently.

705
00:59:59,498 --> 01:00:00,581
Thank you.

706
01:00:00,915 --> 01:00:04,040
Bye. Call me after the match.

707
01:00:04,206 --> 01:00:05,040
Love you.

708
01:00:05,290 --> 01:00:06,290
Okay. Bye.

709
01:00:10,706 --> 01:00:11,706
Thank you.

710
01:00:14,123 --> 01:00:16,331
Bro, where does Amitabh Bachchan stay?

711
01:00:17,331 --> 01:00:18,998
Can we see his house?

712
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:21,915
Or should we visit Salman Khan?
He's single. Like me.

713
01:00:41,998 --> 01:00:43,257
Kabaddi.

714
01:00:43,415 --> 01:00:45,040
Sir, we won't take up
much of your time.

715
01:00:45,123 --> 01:00:46,498
Just one or two moves.

716
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:47,706
No problem.

717
01:00:56,873 --> 01:00:58,331
You are doing well, Jaya.

718
01:01:04,456 --> 01:01:05,873
Kabaddi... kabaddi...

719
01:01:18,326 --> 01:01:20,076
Jaya, very good!

720
01:01:25,873 --> 01:01:27,290
-Well played, Jaya.
-Thank you.

721
01:01:29,331 --> 01:01:34,748
We could use an experienced player
like you in the Eastern Railway team.

722
01:01:35,373 --> 01:01:37,165
-Thank you, sir.
-Not at all.

723
01:01:37,498 --> 01:01:38,790
You're welcome.

724
01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:42,956
You'll play for the Eastern Railway
and also work for them.

725
01:01:43,790 --> 01:01:46,165
You must report in Kolkata
in two weeks.

726
01:01:46,415 --> 01:01:49,206
We'll see to
your transfer formalities.

727
01:01:49,685 --> 01:01:52,143
Sir, I can't shift to Kolkata.

728
01:01:52,248 --> 01:01:54,290
I can go back and forth.

729
01:01:54,456 --> 01:01:56,206
But, I will train in Bhopal.

730
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,831
How will you practice?

731
01:02:00,081 --> 01:02:02,040
I'll practice in Bhopal.

732
01:02:02,165 --> 01:02:04,040
Definitely.

733
01:02:04,123 --> 01:02:06,706
I have a little child.
I won't be able to manage.

734
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:11,040
-Jaya...
-I coach my team.

735
01:02:11,373 --> 01:02:14,081
I want to see you play and
practice everyday.

736
01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:16,206
This is not a correspondence course.

737
01:02:16,290 --> 01:02:18,456
Sir, I understand.
But I have a child

738
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:21,040
and I cannot leave home.

739
01:02:23,665 --> 01:02:25,290
-Meenu.
-Yes, sir.

740
01:02:25,456 --> 01:02:27,665
-Both of you need to decide.
-Sir...

741
01:02:34,456 --> 01:02:38,290
If the team is from Kolkata,
they are not going to practice in Canada.

742
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:39,831
I don't get it, Jaya.

743
01:02:39,873 --> 01:02:42,581
Along with your body
even your brain is rusty.

744
01:02:42,748 --> 01:02:43,873
You're not married.

745
01:02:43,915 --> 01:02:46,081
You don't have kids.
You won't understand.

746
01:02:46,665 --> 01:02:48,790
Then why are you wasting my time?

747
01:02:48,873 --> 01:02:51,415
I've paused my life, for you.

748
01:02:51,498 --> 01:02:54,197
Sorry. I'm sorry I asked you to come.

749
01:02:54,373 --> 01:02:55,915
And wasted your time.

750
01:02:55,998 --> 01:02:58,081
But, I can't leave
Adi and Prashant.

751
01:02:58,206 --> 01:03:00,248
Jaya, I'm not asking you to.

752
01:03:00,331 --> 01:03:03,578
All I'm saying is
focus a bit on your dream.

753
01:03:03,681 --> 01:03:04,723
I'm a mother.

754
01:03:04,748 --> 01:03:07,081
And a mother cannot dream.
They neither have meaning

755
01:03:07,165 --> 01:03:08,581
nor any value.

756
01:03:08,665 --> 01:03:12,706
If I tell my family that they'll
have to do the dishes, cook...

757
01:03:12,790 --> 01:03:13,898
watch their reaction.

758
01:03:14,373 --> 01:03:16,831
All big talk about
women empowerment,

759
01:03:16,915 --> 01:03:19,665
mummy's dreams, kabaddi,
will all vanish.

760
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:21,961
A mother has no right to dream.

761
01:03:22,023 --> 01:03:25,456
And if I still dream, I'm selfish.
A cruel mother.

762
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:26,623
God!

763
01:03:26,706 --> 01:03:29,706
Then why did you bother
coming here?

764
01:03:30,706 --> 01:03:32,498
To test my limits.

765
01:03:32,665 --> 01:03:34,790
This is the maximum I can push.

766
01:03:35,623 --> 01:03:36,623
Sit!

767
01:03:37,498 --> 01:03:38,331
Let's go.

768
01:03:38,415 --> 01:03:40,248
Selfish mother
will sit alone at the back.

769
01:03:49,136 --> 01:03:51,398
It doesn't look like
you've been selected.

770
01:03:52,751 --> 01:03:54,834
Why should I smile
when I'm not happy?

771
01:03:56,745 --> 01:03:59,620
If I go to Kolkata
how will you manage?

772
01:04:00,290 --> 01:04:04,623
Adi, meals, Adi's school,
homework, medicines,

773
01:04:05,294 --> 01:04:07,169
your work, home.

774
01:04:07,415 --> 01:04:11,331
If I start to list down chores,
even 200 pages won't be enough.

775
01:04:12,873 --> 01:04:14,415
How will the house function without me?

776
01:04:14,837 --> 01:04:16,128
Tell me.

777
01:04:23,056 --> 01:04:24,211
Don't bother.

778
01:04:24,456 --> 01:04:26,601
I can clearly see the answer
on your face.

779
01:04:50,290 --> 01:04:51,998
One ticket to Sanchi.

780
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:11,998
Give me two minutes.
I'll serve you.

781
01:05:12,248 --> 01:05:13,290
I'll manage.

782
01:05:13,665 --> 01:05:14,956
I have to get used to it.

783
01:05:17,498 --> 01:05:19,206
You're going to Kolkata, right?

784
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:26,081
At best what will happen
without you?

785
01:05:26,665 --> 01:05:28,498
We won't get food
made by you.

786
01:05:28,748 --> 01:05:30,498
There'll be many problems

787
01:05:30,581 --> 01:05:34,623
which neither you nor I
will remember after a year.

788
01:05:35,248 --> 01:05:38,373
The only thing we'll remember
is that you had a chance

789
01:05:38,748 --> 01:05:40,040
and you let it slip away.

790
01:05:42,290 --> 01:05:44,415
Jaya, don't make
the mistake again.

791
01:05:44,956 --> 01:05:48,040
Prashant, how will Adi
stay without me?

792
01:05:49,498 --> 01:05:51,331
I'll be sad, mummy...

793
01:05:51,790 --> 01:05:53,998
if you quit kabaddi again.

794
01:05:54,581 --> 01:05:57,956
And finally we're getting a little freedom.

795
01:05:58,328 --> 01:06:00,203
Don't take it away from us.

796
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:01,331
Right, Adi?

797
01:06:01,581 --> 01:06:03,331
Yes. Mummy, please go.

798
01:06:15,831 --> 01:06:17,540
Made these sweets for you.

799
01:06:17,915 --> 01:06:19,540
There was no need.

800
01:06:20,665 --> 01:06:21,415
Thank you.

801
01:06:22,415 --> 01:06:23,665
I'll miss you.

802
01:06:23,831 --> 01:06:25,540
Make us proud.

803
01:06:26,373 --> 01:06:27,498
Take care.

804
01:06:27,581 --> 01:06:28,540
You too.

805
01:06:28,623 --> 01:06:30,373
-Tell the boss.
-Sure.

806
01:06:31,206 --> 01:06:32,206
Bye.

807
01:06:33,081 --> 01:06:35,415
I'm stocking some essentials.

808
01:06:36,243 --> 01:06:37,534
They'll be alone.

809
01:06:37,776 --> 01:06:39,151
Please keep an eye.

810
01:06:39,325 --> 01:06:40,825
Don't worry.

811
01:06:41,179 --> 01:06:43,845
You're lucky to get a second chance.

812
01:06:45,915 --> 01:06:47,373
See you soon.

813
01:06:49,873 --> 01:06:51,495
Take care.

814
01:06:53,706 --> 01:06:55,790
Prashant, let me know
if you need anything.

815
01:06:55,873 --> 01:06:57,206
Sure, thank you.

816
01:07:05,165 --> 01:07:08,808
Only someone as wise as Prashant
can handle a crazy one like you.

817
01:07:09,165 --> 01:07:13,089
Ask God for a similar one
for yourself.

818
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:17,706
Right now I'm praying that
you make a mark in kabaddi once again.

819
01:07:21,415 --> 01:07:22,665
Take care.

820
01:07:28,331 --> 01:07:29,723
Will you miss, mummy?

821
01:07:29,748 --> 01:07:30,581
No.

822
01:07:30,706 --> 01:07:31,706
Liar!

823
01:07:58,790 --> 01:08:00,540
What time does Adi's school bus come?

824
01:08:00,623 --> 01:08:01,623
7 am.

825
01:08:02,456 --> 01:08:04,290
What's on 15th August and 26th January?

826
01:08:04,373 --> 01:08:06,209
Independence day and Republic day.

827
01:08:06,331 --> 01:08:08,873
Prashant! No-worm day.

828
01:08:09,123 --> 01:08:13,165
You have to deworm him.
What medication does he take everyday?

829
01:08:13,248 --> 01:08:14,498
Zincovit.

830
01:08:14,581 --> 01:08:15,790
How much?

831
01:08:16,206 --> 01:08:17,290
5 ml.

832
01:08:19,665 --> 01:08:23,248
Adi, if papa forgets, remind him.

833
01:08:24,790 --> 01:08:26,623
What do you have to do everyday?

834
01:08:26,831 --> 01:08:28,498
Video call.

835
01:08:36,290 --> 01:08:37,206
Take care.

836
01:08:39,415 --> 01:08:40,331
Bye.

837
01:08:40,665 --> 01:08:41,665
Come, Adi.

838
01:08:59,581 --> 01:09:00,581
Prashant.

839
01:09:01,748 --> 01:09:02,915
Yes, Jaya?

840
01:09:04,331 --> 01:09:05,748
Call me as soon as you reach.

841
01:09:05,831 --> 01:09:08,248
If you can't call from the train,
message me.

842
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,748
And don't worry about Adi.

843
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:14,081
I've spoken to your mother.
She said that she'd drop by as and when.

844
01:09:14,581 --> 01:09:16,415
But I can manage alone, as well.

845
01:09:16,956 --> 01:09:18,915
Ask me anything if you're still unsure.

846
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:22,373
How many whistles do lentils take
to cook?

847
01:09:23,331 --> 01:09:25,540
Jaya, there's the train's whistle.
Go, sit.

848
01:09:26,706 --> 01:09:29,248
Don't worry about us
and concentrate on your practice.

849
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:31,415
Water the marigolds every alternate day.

850
01:09:31,498 --> 01:09:33,040
-Okay.
-I love you.

851
01:09:33,165 --> 01:09:34,331
Love you, too.

852
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:35,956
-Bye, Adi.
-Bye.

853
01:10:04,609 --> 01:10:08,067
Prashant, I got a cab.
What have you guys cooked?

854
01:10:08,290 --> 01:10:09,581
Potato curry?

855
01:10:09,915 --> 01:10:12,069
I hope you haven't used too much oil.

856
01:10:13,248 --> 01:10:15,085
I'll call you once I reach the hostel.

857
01:10:30,748 --> 01:10:31,748
Here you go.

858
01:10:42,782 --> 01:10:44,282
-Greetings.
-Greetings.

859
01:10:51,241 --> 01:10:52,407
Jaya Nigam.

860
01:10:53,116 --> 01:10:54,199
It's fine.

861
01:10:54,367 --> 01:10:58,409
-Where's my room?
-Straight, up the stairs.

862
01:10:58,757 --> 01:11:02,507
Take a left.
Go to the first floor.

863
01:11:02,532 --> 01:11:04,549
There's a door next to the stairs.
Go there.

864
01:11:04,574 --> 01:11:05,449
Alright.

865
01:11:05,741 --> 01:11:07,574
The second door.

866
01:11:07,607 --> 01:11:10,398
The corner room...

867
01:11:10,741 --> 01:11:12,324
Room number 21.

868
01:11:13,532 --> 01:11:14,574
Got it?

869
01:11:49,449 --> 01:11:50,449
Hello.

870
01:11:54,407 --> 01:11:57,574
Too old to be a player
and too young for a coach.

871
01:11:57,907 --> 01:11:59,032
Who are you?

872
01:12:00,949 --> 01:12:03,366
-Is this how you speak to your coach?
-Sorry, ma'am.

873
01:12:03,532 --> 01:12:05,366
Get the bags inside.

874
01:12:07,991 --> 01:12:10,032
You keep the room so untidy.

875
01:12:15,699 --> 01:12:17,699
Do you sleep with the lights on?

876
01:12:18,074 --> 01:12:19,241
Sometimes.

877
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:22,157
Very bad.

878
01:12:22,407 --> 01:12:24,282
I won't anymore, ma'am.

879
01:12:27,282 --> 01:12:28,282
Prashant...

880
01:12:30,574 --> 01:12:32,949
-What's your name?
-Nisha Das.

881
01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:37,799
We're about to eat.

882
01:12:37,824 --> 01:12:40,858
Potato curry sans oil with flatbreads.

883
01:12:41,366 --> 01:12:42,366
And Adi?

884
01:12:47,824 --> 01:12:49,366
Has he gone to sleep?

885
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:52,491
Jaya's a new player.

886
01:12:52,782 --> 01:12:55,699
From today she'll be playing
for Eastern Railway.

887
01:12:59,616 --> 01:13:01,699
That was quite a fast one
you pulled on me.

888
01:13:01,991 --> 01:13:05,949
I only swung to the full toss
you threw at me.

889
01:13:07,949 --> 01:13:09,866
The next time it will be a googly.

890
01:13:10,324 --> 01:13:12,204
Don't give out your strategy.

891
01:13:16,949 --> 01:13:20,032
Are you only interested in cricket
or does kabaddi interest you, too?

892
01:13:20,199 --> 01:13:21,949
Till that line.

893
01:13:33,366 --> 01:13:36,478
This is known as a catch in both,
cricket and kabaddi.

894
01:13:39,024 --> 01:13:40,024
Again.

895
01:13:43,657 --> 01:13:45,936
You've been the Indian team captain!

896
01:13:46,116 --> 01:13:49,324
Yes. I'm also mother to a 7-year-old.

897
01:13:50,863 --> 01:13:52,488
You're great, sista!

898
01:13:54,553 --> 01:13:56,386
You can fall at these feet now.

899
01:13:57,980 --> 01:13:59,230
I can't reach.

900
01:14:04,766 --> 01:14:06,475
Kabaddi...

901
01:14:19,165 --> 01:14:20,540
Concentrate, Jaya.

902
01:14:20,574 --> 01:14:21,848
You can do it.

903
01:14:24,866 --> 01:14:26,949
Kabaddi...

904
01:14:36,186 --> 01:14:39,519
You have to work on your speed.

905
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:42,949
I'll try defending.

906
01:14:43,799 --> 01:14:46,882
The team's zooming like a bullet train
and I'm crawling like a tram.

907
01:14:46,907 --> 01:14:49,866
At this rate, you won't make it
to the Railways team or the Indian team.

908
01:14:49,964 --> 01:14:50,964
Thank you.

909
01:14:51,063 --> 01:14:53,480
I suggest a personal coach.

910
01:14:53,753 --> 01:14:54,878
Everyone has one.

911
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:56,949
When the journey's long
and you're strapped for time,

912
01:14:56,974 --> 01:14:58,558
you need a double engine.

913
01:14:58,824 --> 01:15:01,032
Do you have someone in mind?

914
01:15:09,350 --> 01:15:12,391
Why haven't you got married
till now?

915
01:15:12,657 --> 01:15:14,407
I never wanted to.

916
01:15:15,241 --> 01:15:16,866
Then why bother now?

917
01:15:17,199 --> 01:15:21,782
In a few years,
my eggs will not deliver.

918
01:15:21,949 --> 01:15:24,074
These guys want a grandchild next year.

919
01:15:24,157 --> 01:15:25,282
So, here I am!

920
01:15:32,116 --> 01:15:33,241
Excuse me.

921
01:15:34,157 --> 01:15:36,781
Hello, darling. How are you?

922
01:15:42,866 --> 01:15:46,907
Will she continue with kabaddi
even after marriage?

923
01:15:47,949 --> 01:15:50,741
What harm if the daughter-in-law
earns as well?

924
01:15:50,949 --> 01:15:53,074
Really? Is kabaddi a lucrative sport?

925
01:15:53,282 --> 01:15:54,574
Absolutely.

926
01:15:57,074 --> 01:16:00,924
I'll be in Kolkata soon
to drown you in my debt.

927
01:16:00,949 --> 01:16:04,458
So, we'll get them engaged
in a couple of weeks.

928
01:16:04,616 --> 01:16:06,824
And then we'll find an auspicious day
for the wedding.

929
01:16:08,032 --> 01:16:10,074
Later, alligator!

930
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:16,836
Dude, you've lost your chance.

931
01:16:17,282 --> 01:16:19,241
Eat the snacks and leave.

932
01:16:19,324 --> 01:16:21,366
They're really fresh.
I haven't made them.

933
01:16:21,907 --> 01:16:24,199
I'm off to Kolkata.
I'll call you.

934
01:16:38,032 --> 01:16:40,449
-What's this, papa?
-Stuffed flatbread.

935
01:16:40,699 --> 01:16:43,032
Sure, it looks a little scary.

936
01:16:45,241 --> 01:16:47,407
I'm stuffed just looking at it.

937
01:16:55,616 --> 01:16:56,991
I haven't seen Jaya lately.

938
01:16:57,074 --> 01:16:58,366
Is she fine?

939
01:16:59,526 --> 01:17:01,943
She isn't even active
on the WhatsApp group.

940
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:04,925
-Jaya's in Kolkata.
-What's wrong?

941
01:17:06,132 --> 01:17:07,882
You both seemed very happy.

942
01:17:07,907 --> 01:17:10,407
It's not what you're thinking.

943
01:17:10,657 --> 01:17:13,116
She's started training
for kabaddi again.

944
01:17:20,782 --> 01:17:23,032
Please add me to the WhatsApp group.

945
01:17:28,116 --> 01:17:32,324
The big door, isn't it?
I have arrived.

946
01:17:34,532 --> 01:17:37,241
Who have you come to meet?

947
01:17:37,657 --> 01:17:39,824
I don't go to meet people.

948
01:17:39,907 --> 01:17:41,824
Even the big guns come to meet me.

949
01:17:42,907 --> 01:17:43,951
Meenu...

950
01:17:46,699 --> 01:17:48,324
This is Meenu!

951
01:17:48,574 --> 01:17:51,699
Nisha suggested a push start.
I thought of an even better idea.

952
01:17:51,782 --> 01:17:53,241
A rocket start!

953
01:17:54,199 --> 01:17:55,741
Who's Nisha?

954
01:17:56,074 --> 01:17:57,366
My roommate.

955
01:17:57,657 --> 01:17:59,907
Hi, Ms Roomie!

956
01:18:00,782 --> 01:18:02,949
-Let's go.
-Put some meat on those bones.

957
01:18:04,574 --> 01:18:06,657
Why did you have to tell them?

958
01:18:07,116 --> 01:18:08,657
They'll make a mountain of a molehill.

959
01:18:08,824 --> 01:18:11,365
No way. They're decent ladies.

960
01:18:16,782 --> 01:18:19,366
It was easy to slide and get up
on the mud.

961
01:18:19,449 --> 01:18:21,532
It's easier on the mat.

962
01:18:22,074 --> 01:18:23,074
Try again.

963
01:18:24,309 --> 01:18:25,309
Come on, Jaya.

964
01:18:25,366 --> 01:18:26,866
Slip under the chain.

965
01:18:32,366 --> 01:18:34,866
Mat is easier, but it slows you down.

966
01:18:34,949 --> 01:18:35,949
Come on.

967
01:18:36,792 --> 01:18:39,625
And your speed was always a weakness.

968
01:18:40,972 --> 01:18:43,305
Why're you staring at me?
Get up.

969
01:18:47,366 --> 01:18:49,241
Speed isn't your forte.

970
01:18:49,824 --> 01:18:51,782
Figure out your strength.

971
01:19:03,824 --> 01:19:05,748
Your strength is your strength.

972
01:19:06,199 --> 01:19:06,966
Correct!

973
01:19:06,991 --> 01:19:09,717
I won't go under the chain.
I'll break the chain.

974
01:19:26,366 --> 01:19:27,616
-Let's go.
-Who'll clear up?

975
01:19:27,657 --> 01:19:29,241
Later this evening.
Hurry.

976
01:20:10,907 --> 01:20:12,782
What was that?

977
01:20:12,907 --> 01:20:15,032
Holding one leg won't work.

978
01:20:15,991 --> 01:20:19,491
What would Prashant do
if you left him?

979
01:20:20,574 --> 01:20:22,116
Why do you want me divorced?

980
01:20:22,366 --> 01:20:23,574
Give me another example.

981
01:20:24,032 --> 01:20:26,324
I'm only asking you to imagine it.

982
01:20:29,576 --> 01:20:30,522
That's it!

983
01:21:31,719 --> 01:21:32,886
Is mummy here?

984
01:21:33,032 --> 01:21:36,199
No, your mummy's mummy is here.

985
01:21:36,532 --> 01:21:39,866
Grandma, this is the first time
I'm ecstatic seeing you.

986
01:21:40,241 --> 01:21:41,491
Want a whack?

987
01:21:41,657 --> 01:21:43,282
I'll go straight to the food.

988
01:21:43,366 --> 01:21:45,824
-What will you have?
-Cottage cheese.

989
01:21:56,934 --> 01:21:59,012
This ankle lock's a problem for me.

990
01:21:59,268 --> 01:22:01,143
I'll have to figure a solution.

991
01:22:01,331 --> 01:22:02,873
Nisha, get the laptop.

992
01:22:06,764 --> 01:22:07,764
Here.

993
01:22:09,782 --> 01:22:10,583
Seriously?

994
01:22:11,449 --> 01:22:13,199
This Tiger Chan move?

995
01:22:14,282 --> 01:22:17,116
How can I do this?
Only guys can pull this off.

996
01:22:18,782 --> 01:22:19,657
Tiger Chan.

997
01:22:19,949 --> 01:22:21,199
Tiger Chan?

998
01:22:21,907 --> 01:22:24,824
Tiger Shroff and Jackie Chan's
surrogate child.

999
01:22:26,491 --> 01:22:29,532
Jaya, have you called me from Bhopal
to waste my time?

1000
01:22:29,824 --> 01:22:30,907
Try it, at least.

1001
01:22:31,053 --> 01:22:33,344
I'm barely managing to play.

1002
01:22:37,116 --> 01:22:39,116
I'll break my bones.

1003
01:22:40,394 --> 01:22:41,769
Try, sista.

1004
01:22:41,844 --> 01:22:43,011
I have a little child.

1005
01:22:43,407 --> 01:22:45,741
What if I break my back?

1006
01:22:47,324 --> 01:22:48,782
Nisha, she won't play.

1007
01:22:48,949 --> 01:22:50,157
Make me some tea instead.

1008
01:22:50,241 --> 01:22:51,453
Go make some tea.

1009
01:23:15,324 --> 01:23:18,241
Hello, Mrs Pandey. I'll be late today.

1010
01:23:18,449 --> 01:23:20,074
Please could you give Adi dinner?

1011
01:23:20,491 --> 01:23:22,949
Eat first. Do your homework later.

1012
01:23:24,699 --> 01:23:26,241
Dinner first.

1013
01:24:32,318 --> 01:24:34,484
Papa, I can't go on stage like this.

1014
01:24:46,491 --> 01:24:47,574
Don't worry.

1015
01:24:47,842 --> 01:24:50,217
Let's video call mummy
and get it sorted.

1016
01:24:50,699 --> 01:24:51,858
I'll call her.

1017
01:24:52,824 --> 01:24:57,288
If you get selected in the Railways team,
then the sky is the limit.

1018
01:24:57,574 --> 01:24:58,699
All the best.

1019
01:25:00,866 --> 01:25:02,699
Ready?

1020
01:25:03,407 --> 01:25:04,741
Just a minute, sir.

1021
01:25:06,866 --> 01:25:09,657
Prashant, I told you my match
is about to begin.

1022
01:25:10,258 --> 01:25:12,758
Mummy, look what papa has done.

1023
01:25:12,899 --> 01:25:14,899
Jaya, it's a mess.

1024
01:25:15,050 --> 01:25:16,425
Can you do anything?

1025
01:25:16,549 --> 01:25:17,924
He has to go on stage
in a couple of minutes.

1026
01:25:17,949 --> 01:25:19,907
Prashant, you've ruined his face.

1027
01:25:20,311 --> 01:25:22,769
Didn't I explain to you last night
how to do the face?

1028
01:25:25,265 --> 01:25:26,793
Jaya, tell me what to do.

1029
01:25:27,535 --> 01:25:30,369
Wait... I'll...

1030
01:25:30,944 --> 01:25:33,569
I asked you to do one thing
and you couldn't even manage that.

1031
01:25:33,954 --> 01:25:35,870
And now you're asking me
to find a solution?

1032
01:25:35,954 --> 01:25:38,412
I'm managing everything without you.

1033
01:25:38,745 --> 01:25:40,537
But, I can't do some things
without you.

1034
01:25:40,594 --> 01:25:42,135
It's quite clear how you're managing.

1035
01:25:42,813 --> 01:25:44,854
I shouldn't have listened
to you guys.

1036
01:25:45,892 --> 01:25:48,017
I should've never come here.

1037
01:25:51,454 --> 01:25:53,662
Prashant, you only talk big.

1038
01:25:53,829 --> 01:25:56,745
-But, when it comes to reality...
-Stop taunting me.

1039
01:25:56,844 --> 01:25:58,135
I'm managing somehow.

1040
01:25:58,192 --> 01:25:59,567
Clearly.

1041
01:25:59,864 --> 01:26:00,781
Go to hell.

1042
01:26:00,958 --> 01:26:02,125
I'm his father.

1043
01:26:02,223 --> 01:26:03,637
We've been okay so far.
I'll figure something.

1044
01:26:03,787 --> 01:26:04,912
Jaya.

1045
01:26:05,588 --> 01:26:09,145
Jaya, go live your dream.
We'll manage.

1046
01:26:09,368 --> 01:26:10,409
Prashant!

1047
01:26:14,556 --> 01:26:15,890
Jaya, come.

1048
01:26:43,454 --> 01:26:44,773
Kabaddi...

1049
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:49,954
Raider safe! 3 points.

1050
01:26:51,454 --> 01:26:53,995
Raider safe!
3 points, Eastern Railway.

1051
01:27:05,745 --> 01:27:07,245
Kabaddi...

1052
01:27:18,912 --> 01:27:20,370
Raider safe, 4 points.

1053
01:27:22,086 --> 01:27:23,794
Half time.
Change the court.

1054
01:27:25,544 --> 01:27:27,002
Everyone's laughing at me.

1055
01:27:27,086 --> 01:27:28,961
Everyone's going to tease me
at school.

1056
01:27:29,412 --> 01:27:30,495
Adi, forget it.

1057
01:27:30,599 --> 01:27:32,557
What do you care? Be quiet!

1058
01:27:32,704 --> 01:27:35,245
I don't want to talk to you.
Call mummy.

1059
01:27:35,359 --> 01:27:39,062
-Mummy's playing a match, love.
-I don't care. Call her.

1060
01:27:39,162 --> 01:27:41,495
Call her back.
I don't want to stay with you.

1061
01:27:41,536 --> 01:27:44,369
I want to stay with mummy.
You don't know anything.

1062
01:27:45,541 --> 01:27:48,041
Fine!
I'll call your mother back.

1063
01:27:52,172 --> 01:27:54,630
Jaya, I was about to call you.

1064
01:27:54,695 --> 01:27:56,570
Prashant, I got selected!

1065
01:27:57,275 --> 01:27:58,234
What?

1066
01:27:58,333 --> 01:28:00,024
I've got selected
for the Railways team.

1067
01:28:00,049 --> 01:28:02,549
Nisha, Jaya, well played.

1068
01:28:04,329 --> 01:28:05,954
Adi, mummy got selected.

1069
01:28:06,662 --> 01:28:07,787
Talk to her.

1070
01:28:11,534 --> 01:28:13,118
Congrats, mummy.

1071
01:28:13,482 --> 01:28:14,565
Thank you, Adi.

1072
01:28:14,870 --> 01:28:17,329
I'm sorry your function
got ruined today.

1073
01:28:17,537 --> 01:28:20,745
Mummy, my performance went off
very well.

1074
01:28:21,370 --> 01:28:22,954
Do you know the applause I got?

1075
01:28:23,133 --> 01:28:25,466
Papa fixed everything
at the last minute.

1076
01:28:25,620 --> 01:28:28,829
-Really?
-We'll see you soon, mummy.

1077
01:28:28,963 --> 01:28:30,463
Excuse me.
Are you Jaya Nigam?

1078
01:28:30,565 --> 01:28:34,190
Hello. I'm Samarth Joshi,
reporter, Zee News.

1079
01:28:34,408 --> 01:28:36,367
I'll call you back.

1080
01:28:38,085 --> 01:28:40,043
How do you know my name?

1081
01:28:40,638 --> 01:28:43,971
Who doesn't know the former captain
of the Indian kabaddi team?

1082
01:28:44,992 --> 01:28:46,950
At least someone does.

1083
01:28:47,383 --> 01:28:49,716
Why did you leave kabaddi
after marriage?

1084
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:52,037
At the peak of your career!

1085
01:28:52,298 --> 01:28:53,965
Family pressure?

1086
01:28:55,305 --> 01:28:57,971
When a girl takes a break
from her career,

1087
01:28:58,045 --> 01:29:00,086
it's not always the family's fault.

1088
01:29:00,787 --> 01:29:02,829
It can be my decision.

1089
01:29:03,138 --> 01:29:05,138
As for my family...

1090
01:29:05,330 --> 01:29:07,539
I didn't leave kabaddi
because of them.

1091
01:29:07,638 --> 01:29:10,388
In fact, I came back
because of them.

1092
01:29:11,718 --> 01:29:13,593
Ma'am, can I record this?

1093
01:29:13,806 --> 01:29:14,765
-Okay.
-Sure.

1094
01:29:14,877 --> 01:29:16,419
Thank you. One minute.

1095
01:29:17,289 --> 01:29:19,705
I'm very happy
that I've reached here.

1096
01:29:19,950 --> 01:29:22,283
But, I want to achieve more.

1097
01:29:22,555 --> 01:29:26,096
I'll be honoured
if I can represent India again.

1098
01:29:31,810 --> 01:29:34,643
Adi, I saw your mummy
on television yesterday.

1099
01:29:36,787 --> 01:29:39,870
"I'm here today
because of my husband's support."

1100
01:29:40,370 --> 01:29:41,662
Unbelievable.

1101
01:29:41,829 --> 01:29:45,245
First, my wife used to say,
"Be romantic like Shah Rukh Khan."

1102
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:48,360
Now, she says,
"Be supportive like Prashant."

1103
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:49,935
Where's the party, dude?

1104
01:29:50,204 --> 01:29:52,704
Right here. Eat all you can.

1105
01:29:53,245 --> 01:29:55,245
That's it? Fine.

1106
01:29:58,745 --> 01:30:00,329
This is new-age India.

1107
01:30:00,537 --> 01:30:02,912
We must support her.

1108
01:30:02,969 --> 01:30:05,760
There are so many women like Jaya
who want to make a comeback.

1109
01:30:06,024 --> 01:30:08,440
Why should we question their capability?

1110
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:12,829
People say she'll leave office at 6 pm
because she has a child to care for.

1111
01:30:13,021 --> 01:30:15,063
Why? Why should they even say that?

1112
01:30:15,204 --> 01:30:17,120
That's not a consideration at all.

1113
01:30:17,715 --> 01:30:20,937
How does a woman being a mother
affect her capability?

1114
01:30:21,037 --> 01:30:22,745
Look at the corporate sector.

1115
01:30:22,829 --> 01:30:25,412
There are many cases where women
have made a comeback

1116
01:30:25,454 --> 01:30:27,204
after becoming a mother.

1117
01:30:27,412 --> 01:30:28,704
Why not sport?

1118
01:30:28,870 --> 01:30:30,787
Keep watching Zee News for more.

1119
01:30:31,162 --> 01:30:32,079
Cheers.

1120
01:30:41,495 --> 01:30:45,829
Every sportsperson dreams of playing
for their country.

1121
01:30:47,099 --> 01:30:49,599
The Asia Kabaddi Championship
selections begins soon.

1122
01:30:49,745 --> 01:30:52,995
And as always,
I want at least 3-4 players

1123
01:30:53,037 --> 01:30:55,329
from the Railway team.

1124
01:30:57,375 --> 01:30:58,250
Okay?

1125
01:31:04,974 --> 01:31:07,182
Jaya, that's Sinha sir.

1126
01:31:08,934 --> 01:31:11,684
Do you think we'll find good players
from the Railways this time?

1127
01:31:11,775 --> 01:31:14,025
He's the Indian team coach
and chief selector.

1128
01:31:14,904 --> 01:31:17,779
We want all of them to be selected.

1129
01:31:21,562 --> 01:31:23,312
Kabaddi...

1130
01:31:31,329 --> 01:31:32,245
Yes!

1131
01:31:32,745 --> 01:31:34,870
Raider safe. 2 points, Railway.

1132
01:31:36,245 --> 01:31:37,566
What do you think, sir?

1133
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Hello, mummy.

1134
01:31:52,057 --> 01:31:58,974
Listen... when you get selected
and give an interview,

1135
01:31:59,343 --> 01:32:01,673
don't just credit Prashant.

1136
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:04,291
Talk about your mummy, too.

1137
01:32:05,291 --> 01:32:09,125
How I raised you.

1138
01:32:09,604 --> 01:32:13,979
Changed your nappies.
And helped you with your son.

1139
01:32:14,416 --> 01:32:16,416
Cleaned my puke. Made my braids.

1140
01:32:16,750 --> 01:32:18,333
Two of them.

1141
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:21,833
Okay, my child.

1142
01:32:22,583 --> 01:32:23,541
Alright.

1143
01:32:23,791 --> 01:32:25,156
Bye.

1144
01:32:25,416 --> 01:32:27,166
Kabaddi...

1145
01:32:34,375 --> 01:32:36,708
2 points, Tamil Nadu.

1146
01:32:36,875 --> 01:32:39,375
-She's the Jaya Nigam from 2011.
-Yes, sir.

1147
01:32:41,125 --> 01:32:42,875
She used to be a star player.

1148
01:32:48,208 --> 01:32:49,500
Sakshi, steady.

1149
01:32:51,625 --> 01:32:52,666
Grab her.

1150
01:32:58,875 --> 01:33:00,008
Sir, this is Nisha.

1151
01:33:05,083 --> 01:33:07,291
Today is the last day

1152
01:33:07,375 --> 01:33:10,375
of the Asia Kabaddi Championship
selections in Delhi.

1153
01:33:10,541 --> 01:33:13,500
The country has their eyes
on Jaya Nigam.

1154
01:33:13,666 --> 01:33:17,000
Let's wait and watch if she makes
a comeback into the national team.

1155
01:33:17,625 --> 01:33:19,833
The selections are underway
for the Men's team.

1156
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,250
Will Praveen Singh make team captain
once again?

1157
01:33:23,458 --> 01:33:25,583
In the next few days,
we'll announce the selections

1158
01:33:25,666 --> 01:33:27,750
for the Indian Women's kabaddi team.

1159
01:33:27,916 --> 01:33:32,291
We have to wait and watch
if Jaya Nigam will make the team.

1160
01:33:32,333 --> 01:33:34,708
Sir, the media's showing
a lot of interest.

1161
01:33:35,125 --> 01:33:37,041
Perfect, Mr More.

1162
01:33:37,625 --> 01:33:41,958
This benefits Women's kabaddi.

1163
01:33:44,125 --> 01:33:45,500
Saba Desai

1164
01:33:45,708 --> 01:33:46,875
Rimpi Dewan

1165
01:33:47,208 --> 01:33:48,250
Neha Ghadge

1166
01:33:48,541 --> 01:33:49,541
Sweety Singh

1167
01:33:49,791 --> 01:33:51,125
and Pooja Jadhav.

1168
01:33:51,416 --> 01:33:53,083
This is our final team.

1169
01:33:53,274 --> 01:33:54,774
Any comments?

1170
01:34:03,911 --> 01:34:09,786
Sir, I feel this list is missing
an important name.

1171
01:34:10,833 --> 01:34:12,291
Jaya Nigam.

1172
01:34:13,416 --> 01:34:16,125
Do you think Jaya can replace
any player from this list?

1173
01:34:16,833 --> 01:34:18,750
Sir, I'm not suggesting a replacement.

1174
01:34:18,961 --> 01:34:23,336
All I'm saying is that she should
be in the team as a substitute.

1175
01:34:24,416 --> 01:34:25,875
How can that happen?

1176
01:34:26,041 --> 01:34:27,583
Mr Sinha, what're you saying?

1177
01:34:27,664 --> 01:34:32,164
Sir, have our girls ever lost at kabaddi?

1178
01:34:32,543 --> 01:34:35,126
In spite of which
our women's kabaddi team

1179
01:34:35,250 --> 01:34:38,125
has never got the popularity
it deserves.

1180
01:34:38,958 --> 01:34:42,458
Suddenly, the whole country is interested.

1181
01:34:44,875 --> 01:34:49,000
Sir, let's give Jaya a spot
in the team.

1182
01:34:50,458 --> 01:34:53,958
Everyone wants to see
a mother's comeback.

1183
01:34:54,791 --> 01:34:58,500
Let's show them and our sport
will reap the benefits.

1184
01:34:59,541 --> 01:35:03,375
If our sport is popular,
only then will we get good players.

1185
01:35:05,208 --> 01:35:06,625
Sir,

1186
01:35:07,828 --> 01:35:09,744
let's give her a spot.

1187
01:35:11,958 --> 01:35:15,291
For sure it'll mean the extra cost
of a player.

1188
01:35:15,375 --> 01:35:21,375
But think of it as an investment
for the future of women's kabaddi.

1189
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,083
Please, sir.

1190
01:35:31,250 --> 01:35:33,166
What?
Jaya got selected?

1191
01:35:33,708 --> 01:35:34,833
Adi, mummy is selected.

1192
01:35:34,916 --> 01:35:37,291
Yay!

1193
01:35:37,458 --> 01:35:39,208
Jaya is selected!

1194
01:35:41,403 --> 01:35:42,903
Jaya is selected!

1195
01:35:44,125 --> 01:35:45,250
What happened?

1196
01:35:45,583 --> 01:35:47,416
Mummy's been selected.

1197
01:35:47,583 --> 01:35:48,958
We're off to Delhi.

1198
01:35:49,041 --> 01:35:50,958
To see the Asia Kabaddi Championship.

1199
01:35:51,125 --> 01:35:53,583
I'll call Jaya right away.

1200
01:36:10,833 --> 01:36:13,916
Have you met Mangal?
She's a superb raider.

1201
01:36:14,750 --> 01:36:15,958
In the white shirt?

1202
01:36:17,666 --> 01:36:18,708
Captain.

1203
01:36:18,791 --> 01:36:21,541
-Sir, is everything okay?
-The one who's standing.

1204
01:36:22,177 --> 01:36:23,625
I'm just waiting for someone.

1205
01:36:23,708 --> 01:36:25,124
Madam, why aren't you eating?

1206
01:36:25,416 --> 01:36:26,541
I'll say hello.

1207
01:36:30,750 --> 01:36:31,875
Hello, Smita.

1208
01:36:33,505 --> 01:36:34,588
I'm Jaya.

1209
01:36:36,083 --> 01:36:37,833
I've been a captain before...

1210
01:36:38,278 --> 01:36:39,986
Who doesn't know you.

1211
01:36:41,708 --> 01:36:44,327
You're the player who has been
selected to warm her seat

1212
01:36:44,791 --> 01:36:46,436
but go back with a gold.

1213
01:36:49,708 --> 01:36:50,833
Pass me the curry.

1214
01:37:05,208 --> 01:37:09,083
An auspicious start
to the 19th Asia Kabaddi Championship.

1215
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:13,250
A big round of applause
for the women's kabaddi team.

1216
01:37:17,955 --> 01:37:19,750
Teams from eight countries.

1217
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,583
28 interesting matches.

1218
01:37:21,791 --> 01:37:25,666
And one prestigious tournament -
the Asia Kabaddi Championship.

1219
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:32,750
And we start this tournament
with host country India playing Thailand.

1220
01:37:36,583 --> 01:37:37,916
-That's mummy.
-Yes.

1221
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:42,000
While the reigning Champions, India,

1222
01:37:42,125 --> 01:37:45,083
will try to strengthen its position
in this group,

1223
01:37:45,416 --> 01:37:50,291
Thailand will strive to put up a tough fight.

1224
01:37:54,750 --> 01:37:58,583
And the referee has invited
both team captains for the toss.

1225
01:37:58,833 --> 01:38:03,750
The winner of the toss
will choose a side or raid first.

1226
01:38:05,375 --> 01:38:06,208
Choose.

1227
01:38:06,291 --> 01:38:09,583
-This side.
-Toss win by India.

1228
01:38:09,666 --> 01:38:11,000
-Choice - side.
-And team Thailand

1229
01:38:11,083 --> 01:38:14,125
is invited to raid first.

1230
01:38:14,416 --> 01:38:15,375
All the best.

1231
01:38:17,375 --> 01:38:18,333
Come on, girls.

1232
01:38:18,416 --> 01:38:19,583
Jaya!

1233
01:38:19,791 --> 01:38:22,125
Playing seven come on the mat.

1234
01:38:24,041 --> 01:38:26,625
While the substitute players
heads towards the dugout.

1235
01:38:34,033 --> 01:38:37,158
First up is Thailand's best raider,
Saowapa.

1236
01:38:37,556 --> 01:38:41,181
She looks for a chance
but the Indian team is fully alert.

1237
01:38:41,791 --> 01:38:43,750
Why isn't Jaya playing?

1238
01:38:43,833 --> 01:38:45,458
She's a substitute.

1239
01:38:45,875 --> 01:38:49,416
Saowapa looks for an opportunity.

1240
01:38:49,708 --> 01:38:53,416
Saowapa tactfully gets Thailand two points.

1241
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:56,750
2 points, Thailand.

1242
01:38:57,375 --> 01:38:58,500
That was a cross!

1243
01:38:58,625 --> 01:39:01,958
The Indian captain looks unhappy.

1244
01:39:02,921 --> 01:39:04,379
And the coach looks angry.

1245
01:39:04,583 --> 01:39:08,458
India's top raider, Kalpana Juneja,
looks for a chance.

1246
01:39:08,541 --> 01:39:09,916
Kabaddi...

1247
01:39:13,041 --> 01:39:15,666
Thailand tries to catch Kalpana,
but she breaks the ankle hold

1248
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:19,666
and beautifully tackles her way out
to get India four points.

1249
01:39:20,833 --> 01:39:22,791
Super raid, 4 points, India.

1250
01:39:22,875 --> 01:39:24,833
India - 4, Thailand - 2

1251
01:39:25,291 --> 01:39:28,250
A few seconds left in the first half.

1252
01:39:28,541 --> 01:39:29,750
Thailand's last raid.

1253
01:39:31,708 --> 01:39:33,291
First half ends.

1254
01:39:33,375 --> 01:39:35,458
India in the lead.

1255
01:39:36,291 --> 01:39:37,583
Second half starts.

1256
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:41,833
India's Kalpana Juneja
trying to increase the lead.

1257
01:39:41,916 --> 01:39:44,000
Our team's killing it!

1258
01:39:44,344 --> 01:39:46,427
Kalpana Juneja turns swiftly.

1259
01:39:46,541 --> 01:39:48,833
Kalpana Juneja is a fantastic raider.

1260
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,208
The Thai team tries to close in
on Kalpana Juneja.

1261
01:39:51,250 --> 01:39:55,416
But, she cleverly scores
four more points.

1262
01:39:56,041 --> 01:39:57,708
Wasana from Thailand
is ready to raid.

1263
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,083
Opposite her are
India's top defenders.

1264
01:40:01,625 --> 01:40:04,916
Rimpi goes for an ankle lock.
Nisha and Smita block her.

1265
01:40:05,083 --> 01:40:07,208
The Indian team displays
exemplary defence.

1266
01:40:09,083 --> 01:40:13,250
-Super tackle, 2 points, India.
-The Thai team appears quite weak.

1267
01:40:13,833 --> 01:40:16,250
Few minutes left
for the match to end.

1268
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:18,375
And India's raid.

1269
01:40:18,458 --> 01:40:20,750
She's been sitting for so long.
When will mummy play?

1270
01:40:20,958 --> 01:40:21,875
Soon.

1271
01:40:24,875 --> 01:40:28,916
India has a good lead
and a win is certain.

1272
01:40:29,083 --> 01:40:30,791
Bimla Jain looks for a chance.

1273
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,291
And a fantastic touch point
from Bimla Jain.

1274
01:40:36,375 --> 01:40:39,541
And with her slide,
India wins two points.

1275
01:40:41,416 --> 01:40:42,958
2 points, India.

1276
01:40:45,550 --> 01:40:47,333
Match over.

1277
01:40:47,958 --> 01:40:56,708
With this effortless win, India has made
a clear statement in this tournament.

1278
01:40:57,916 --> 01:41:03,041
The points scored by India in this group
will help them in the knock-out stage.

1279
01:41:03,708 --> 01:41:04,791
We won!

1280
01:41:05,541 --> 01:41:08,583
India will tackle Bangladesh
in the next match.

1281
01:41:12,750 --> 01:41:13,833
Well played.

1282
01:41:16,708 --> 01:41:17,791
Nisha.

1283
01:41:18,375 --> 01:41:20,000
-Shall we go?
-Let's go.

1284
01:41:23,916 --> 01:41:24,916
Prashant.

1285
01:41:29,958 --> 01:41:30,833
Adi.

1286
01:41:32,166 --> 01:41:34,000
Your team played very well, Jaya.

1287
01:41:34,046 --> 01:41:35,754
Whose team, after all!

1288
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:38,166
When will you play, mummy?

1289
01:41:38,333 --> 01:41:39,625
Maybe the next one.

1290
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,500
Have you met Nisha?
Say hello to her.

1291
01:41:41,625 --> 01:41:43,541
-Hi!
-That's my mother, Prashant and Adi.

1292
01:41:43,750 --> 01:41:45,125
Hello.

1293
01:41:45,708 --> 01:41:46,666
What did you'll eat?

1294
01:41:46,708 --> 01:41:47,250
Nisha!

1295
01:41:47,750 --> 01:41:49,500
The bus is here.
We have to go.

1296
01:41:49,916 --> 01:41:51,166
I have to go.

1297
01:42:00,500 --> 01:42:03,791
Sir, please comment
on the Indian team's performance.

1298
01:42:03,875 --> 01:42:06,750
We played well.
We've got the right spirit.

1299
01:42:07,208 --> 01:42:09,844
It should continue this way.

1300
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:13,333
India has secured a win
in group A,

1301
01:42:13,416 --> 01:42:16,958
while Iran beat South Korea
in the group B match.

1302
01:42:18,158 --> 01:42:21,242
Iran won the match by 38-20.

1303
01:42:21,791 --> 01:42:24,333
-They're strong.
-They sure are.

1304
01:42:26,083 --> 01:42:28,041
Do you want to get strong?
Eat well.

1305
01:42:28,125 --> 01:42:29,750
Have some cottage cheese.

1306
01:42:31,416 --> 01:42:34,083
The second match in group A -
India vs Bangladesh.

1307
01:42:34,208 --> 01:42:35,833
The last seven minutes remain.

1308
01:42:36,041 --> 01:42:38,875
India ahead with a strong lead.

1309
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,708
Salma's double ankle-hold attack.
Kalpana jumps and...

1310
01:42:46,083 --> 01:42:49,125
It looks like Kalpana is hurt.

1311
01:42:50,125 --> 01:42:53,208
-Kalpana has twisted her ankle.
-Point, Bangladesh.

1312
01:42:53,375 --> 01:42:56,750
-Kalpana?
-Tough times for Kalpana.

1313
01:42:57,041 --> 01:42:59,208
Her ankle took the hit,
didn't it?

1314
01:43:00,109 --> 01:43:01,525
Official time out.

1315
01:43:03,250 --> 01:43:04,166
Gauri ma'am.

1316
01:43:04,166 --> 01:43:07,250
Substitute player Jaya Nigam
and assistant coach Gauri Wadekar

1317
01:43:07,291 --> 01:43:09,250
come forward to help Kalpana.

1318
01:43:15,791 --> 01:43:17,791
Kalpana seems to be in a lot of pain,

1319
01:43:17,791 --> 01:43:20,083
and might not be able to play
the rest of the match.

1320
01:43:20,416 --> 01:43:22,375
Some excuse to come on the mat.

1321
01:43:23,458 --> 01:43:25,625
She had to injure herself!

1322
01:43:29,541 --> 01:43:32,083
Referee, time out.

1323
01:43:32,166 --> 01:43:34,416
Second half.
First time out, India.

1324
01:43:35,625 --> 01:43:37,125
I think now mummy will play.

1325
01:43:37,250 --> 01:43:39,125
She will.

1326
01:43:42,291 --> 01:43:44,375
The coach has chosen Hemlata Kumari.

1327
01:43:44,458 --> 01:43:49,791
India's youngest player is about to play
her first international match.

1328
01:43:50,083 --> 01:43:52,708
She may not be able to make
such an impact in this match

1329
01:43:52,750 --> 01:43:54,916
because India has nearly won the match.

1330
01:43:55,291 --> 01:43:57,166
If an experienced raider is hurt,

1331
01:43:57,250 --> 01:43:59,208
shouldn't she be replaced
by an experienced one?

1332
01:43:59,416 --> 01:44:02,166
Why an amateur? Dammit!

1333
01:44:02,625 --> 01:44:04,041
Last minute of the match.

1334
01:44:04,125 --> 01:44:05,875
Orpa from Bangladesh.

1335
01:44:05,958 --> 01:44:07,875
Bangladesh is far from its goal.

1336
01:44:08,041 --> 01:44:11,166
Indian fans won't be disappointed today.

1337
01:44:12,750 --> 01:44:14,291
Orpa's touch point.
Smita's block.

1338
01:44:14,375 --> 01:44:15,666
She has grasped Orpa.

1339
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:18,916
The team supports beautifully.
Orpa is down.

1340
01:44:19,250 --> 01:44:20,958
India shows excellent teamwork.

1341
01:44:21,041 --> 01:44:23,291
They've earned another point.

1342
01:44:23,875 --> 01:44:27,291
Looks like Bangladesh
will exit group A.

1343
01:44:30,375 --> 01:44:31,750
-Here's the final whistle!
-Match over.

1344
01:44:31,875 --> 01:44:35,041
Bangladesh - 22, India - 30

1345
01:44:35,887 --> 01:44:40,054
India has won today's match
but let me remind you

1346
01:44:40,125 --> 01:44:42,083
it's not going to be easy from here.

1347
01:44:42,250 --> 01:44:43,625
We won.

1348
01:44:54,203 --> 01:44:55,911
When will you play, mummy?

1349
01:44:58,103 --> 01:45:01,437
Is it important for you
that I play or India wins?

1350
01:45:01,833 --> 01:45:02,791
Both.

1351
01:45:06,916 --> 01:45:09,500
What if you had to choose one?

1352
01:45:11,625 --> 01:45:13,166
Just one...

1353
01:45:16,666 --> 01:45:19,666
Ms Jaya, the country is waiting
to see you play

1354
01:45:19,750 --> 01:45:21,583
but you haven't yet got a chance.

1355
01:45:22,083 --> 01:45:23,125
Please comment.

1356
01:45:23,666 --> 01:45:26,458
More important than my playing,
is winning the cup.

1357
01:45:31,375 --> 01:45:32,458
That's the way!

1358
01:45:32,875 --> 01:45:35,208
Learn the sport from me,

1359
01:45:35,291 --> 01:45:37,291
but sportswoman spirit from her.

1360
01:45:37,375 --> 01:45:41,708
In their last group match, India
is almost certain to win against Sri Lanka.

1361
01:45:41,833 --> 01:45:45,708
But without Kalpana Juneja,
the team seems to have weakened.

1362
01:45:45,791 --> 01:45:47,291
2 points, India.

1363
01:45:47,583 --> 01:45:49,125
Our train has been in waiting.

1364
01:45:49,208 --> 01:45:50,791
When will it get the green signal?

1365
01:45:51,875 --> 01:45:54,750
Bro, my train is here.
Please give me a ticket.

1366
01:45:55,833 --> 01:45:58,708
Pressure's on the defense
to make all the points.

1367
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,291
While Bimla Jain
must win the raid.

1368
01:46:01,375 --> 01:46:03,416
She seems tired.

1369
01:46:06,291 --> 01:46:09,125
She slips trying to get a touch point.

1370
01:46:09,208 --> 01:46:12,583
Bimla Jain seems to have injured
her elbow.

1371
01:46:12,875 --> 01:46:15,500
Bimla Jain seems badly hurt.

1372
01:46:17,208 --> 01:46:18,083
What now?

1373
01:46:18,166 --> 01:46:20,500
This isn't good news for India.

1374
01:46:20,583 --> 01:46:23,583
Kalpana Juneja and Bimla Jain, injured.

1375
01:46:23,958 --> 01:46:30,958
Let's see how India strategises the semis
after losing two star raiders.

1376
01:46:32,666 --> 01:46:35,000
We've struggled to reach the top
of this group.

1377
01:46:35,114 --> 01:46:36,947
It seems tough ahead.

1378
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,541
We have to play South Korea.

1379
01:46:40,398 --> 01:46:42,356
It's going to get messy, pal.

1380
01:46:43,250 --> 01:46:44,375
Use this.

1381
01:46:48,958 --> 01:46:53,250
Tell Adi that I'm in a team meeting
and that's why I can't meet him.

1382
01:46:53,541 --> 01:46:57,083
Or he'll ask me again,
"Why aren't you playing?"

1383
01:46:57,687 --> 01:46:59,978
It's fine.
At least the team's playing well.

1384
01:47:00,291 --> 01:47:01,583
Give me the phone.

1385
01:47:01,958 --> 01:47:05,333
Why aren't they
letting you play?

1386
01:47:05,708 --> 01:47:06,958
Mummy, how should I know?

1387
01:47:07,041 --> 01:47:09,583
Find out. Ask the coach.

1388
01:47:09,666 --> 01:47:11,166
He has his own stress.

1389
01:47:11,250 --> 01:47:12,958
And you want me to add to it.

1390
01:47:13,166 --> 01:47:15,416
Mummy, you're talking like a child.

1391
01:47:15,666 --> 01:47:18,791
Why are we coming to the matches
when you aren't even playing?

1392
01:47:19,083 --> 01:47:20,291
Don't come.

1393
01:47:20,666 --> 01:47:23,541
None of you come from tomorrow.
You're giving me unnecessary stress.

1394
01:47:27,708 --> 01:47:29,208
She's still angry.

1395
01:47:30,541 --> 01:47:32,458
She's always in a huff.

1396
01:47:32,875 --> 01:47:34,750
She can surely ask the coach.

1397
01:47:35,875 --> 01:47:39,125
South Korea plays
with a lot of speed.

1398
01:47:39,666 --> 01:47:42,333
We have to slow them down.

1399
01:47:42,757 --> 01:47:45,507
Sir, isn't it better
that we up our speed?

1400
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,958
What if our girls forget
their technique in trying to speed up?

1401
01:47:49,708 --> 01:47:52,250
You're the captain.
Think like one.

1402
01:47:53,791 --> 01:47:54,833
Sorry, sir.

1403
01:47:55,208 --> 01:47:57,005
What are you staring at?
Write it down.

1404
01:47:59,291 --> 01:48:00,583
Can I say something?

1405
01:48:00,833 --> 01:48:02,416
Not if you want to talk
about your position in the team.

1406
01:48:02,500 --> 01:48:04,166
Not at all.

1407
01:48:04,333 --> 01:48:07,833
I have a suggestion on how to
improve our chances with South Korea.

1408
01:48:07,916 --> 01:48:11,500
If we don't extend the cover
bonus points will tempt the raider...

1409
01:48:11,583 --> 01:48:13,166
Aren't you a homemaker?

1410
01:48:17,083 --> 01:48:18,791
Fill the players' bottles.
Take care of them.

1411
01:48:18,875 --> 01:48:21,000
Don't meddle in the team's strategy.

1412
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
-Captain.
-Sir.

1413
01:48:31,125 --> 01:48:32,000
Come here.

1414
01:48:32,583 --> 01:48:33,791
Yes, sir.

1415
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,041
Do you have anything personal
against her?

1416
01:48:40,125 --> 01:48:42,083
She's not taken anyone's spot.

1417
01:48:42,583 --> 01:48:44,166
She's here on her own merit.

1418
01:48:44,990 --> 01:48:47,782
In spite of not playing,
she's still thinking about the team.

1419
01:48:48,679 --> 01:48:51,470
And instead of listening to her,
you're insulting her.

1420
01:48:55,294 --> 01:48:58,836
What should we do?

1421
01:48:59,625 --> 01:49:02,625
Just a minute-and-a-half left
in the first semi-final.

1422
01:49:02,708 --> 01:49:07,041
With great difficulty, India has managed
a lead of two points against South Korea.

1423
01:49:07,083 --> 01:49:08,208
Mink from South Korea.

1424
01:49:08,291 --> 01:49:11,250
South Korea keen on closing the gap.

1425
01:49:11,375 --> 01:49:15,625
India strives to increase that gap.

1426
01:49:15,958 --> 01:49:17,833
A super move by Kim.

1427
01:49:17,916 --> 01:49:19,333
2 points to Korea.

1428
01:49:19,666 --> 01:49:22,750
India has no answer to Korea's speed.

1429
01:49:23,041 --> 01:49:26,083
And Korea manages to equalize
the score at 34 all.

1430
01:49:26,375 --> 01:49:30,625
Just a minute to go
and the score is 34 all.

1431
01:49:37,541 --> 01:49:39,583
Will mummy not play today either?

1432
01:49:39,666 --> 01:49:40,875
I don't know, son.

1433
01:49:40,958 --> 01:49:41,666
Grandma?

1434
01:49:41,791 --> 01:49:44,250
You can ask me anything
about biology.

1435
01:49:44,375 --> 01:49:45,958
Not kabaddi.

1436
01:49:49,333 --> 01:49:51,333
Neha Ghadge coming up
from India.

1437
01:49:51,416 --> 01:49:54,458
Without star raiders Kalpana Juneja
and Bimla Jain,

1438
01:49:54,500 --> 01:49:57,250
India's attack seems slightly weak.

1439
01:49:57,333 --> 01:50:00,000
And that is clearly seen
in today's match.

1440
01:50:00,083 --> 01:50:03,000
Neha Ghadge tries desperately
to get a lead.

1441
01:50:03,083 --> 01:50:04,458
An attempt by Neha Ghadge!

1442
01:50:04,756 --> 01:50:09,714
South Korea's defenders
beautifully tackle Neha Ghadge.

1443
01:50:11,500 --> 01:50:15,790
India gives away a crucial 1-point lead
to South Korea.

1444
01:50:17,958 --> 01:50:20,333
Mummy's still not playing.
I don't want to watch anymore.

1445
01:50:20,541 --> 01:50:21,833
-Adi, wait.
-Adi.

1446
01:50:22,125 --> 01:50:23,708
Adi, wait.
I'm coming, too.

1447
01:50:26,166 --> 01:50:27,458
Adi, wait.

1448
01:50:27,541 --> 01:50:28,875
I'm going.

1449
01:50:29,375 --> 01:50:31,625
I'll join you in a bit.

1450
01:50:35,333 --> 01:50:37,833
30 seconds for the match to end.

1451
01:50:38,166 --> 01:50:41,166
South Korea takes a time-out here.

1452
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:44,583
South Korea - 35, India - 34.

1453
01:50:45,916 --> 01:50:46,916
Neha.

1454
01:50:48,208 --> 01:50:50,666
Adi, look they're taking a selfie.

1455
01:50:50,958 --> 01:50:52,875
Let's take one of yours.

1456
01:50:53,708 --> 01:50:55,000
The last raid of the match.

1457
01:50:57,333 --> 01:50:59,958
South Korea only needs to spend
a few seconds in India's side

1458
01:51:00,041 --> 01:51:02,708
and return to their own.
Their win is almost certain.

1459
01:51:02,791 --> 01:51:05,416
The Indian team is focused
on catching her.

1460
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:07,166
A very good attempt.

1461
01:51:07,791 --> 01:51:10,916
Let's see if it was a super tackle
or not.

1462
01:51:16,041 --> 01:51:20,875
That was a close win for India.
With a lead of 1 point.

1463
01:51:21,250 --> 01:51:24,583
It seemed India would lose this match.

1464
01:51:39,041 --> 01:51:41,041
We can't continue like this.

1465
01:51:41,750 --> 01:51:44,000
We barely scraped through in this match.

1466
01:51:45,750 --> 01:51:48,041
How can we go back
before the final match?

1467
01:51:48,413 --> 01:51:49,746
What are you saying, Jaya?

1468
01:51:49,833 --> 01:51:51,625
Adi's very hurt.

1469
01:51:52,125 --> 01:51:53,833
I can't see him like this.

1470
01:51:54,173 --> 01:51:56,673
He still thinks that I will play.

1471
01:51:58,416 --> 01:52:00,250
These things happen in sports.

1472
01:52:01,333 --> 01:52:03,541
Plus he's missing so much school.

1473
01:52:04,041 --> 01:52:06,750
Jaya, but we're here
to see the finals.

1474
01:52:07,432 --> 01:52:11,932
Prashant, please take Adi
and leave.

1475
01:52:12,750 --> 01:52:13,500
Jaya!

1476
01:52:24,250 --> 01:52:29,541
What a farce!
What's a comeback without playing?

1477
01:52:34,791 --> 01:52:37,958
You'll leave without seeing
the finals?

1478
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:43,416
It's better than going there
and not seeing mummy play.

1479
01:53:00,547 --> 01:53:03,047
Adi, you didn't answer mummy.

1480
01:53:03,743 --> 01:53:08,827
What is more important for you?
That mummy plays or that India wins?

1481
01:53:11,474 --> 01:53:14,765
Iran has won the semi-finals
very easily.

1482
01:53:15,099 --> 01:53:18,390
They'll now take on India
in the finals.

1483
01:53:19,307 --> 01:53:22,307
Iran's team has played
exceptionally well, Mangla.

1484
01:53:23,140 --> 01:53:25,224
Something will have to be done
to stop them.

1485
01:53:27,017 --> 01:53:28,892
Sir, I'm at my wit's end.

1486
01:53:30,530 --> 01:53:35,947
We need players for any strategy to work.

1487
01:53:37,343 --> 01:53:39,177
And we don't have any.

1488
01:53:44,193 --> 01:53:47,193
Captain, may I say something?

1489
01:53:48,218 --> 01:53:49,135
Sure.

1490
01:53:49,919 --> 01:53:55,794
Sir, we need a player who has played
an international match to support us.

1491
01:53:56,390 --> 01:53:57,849
Are you talking about Jaya?

1492
01:53:57,932 --> 01:53:59,057
Yes.

1493
01:53:59,445 --> 01:54:02,279
No one has international experience
like her.

1494
01:54:07,307 --> 01:54:08,432
Thank you.

1495
01:54:14,440 --> 01:54:15,815
She's right, sir.

1496
01:54:17,781 --> 01:54:19,156
You're agreeing?

1497
01:54:19,724 --> 01:54:21,515
You've always been anti Jaya.

1498
01:54:21,695 --> 01:54:24,195
I'm not prejudiced against Jaya.

1499
01:54:24,971 --> 01:54:27,096
I want what's best for my team.

1500
01:54:27,931 --> 01:54:31,014
I still feel she isn't capable enough
to be part of this team.

1501
01:54:31,890 --> 01:54:33,557
But, that's my opinion.

1502
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:36,825
Right now, it's not about me.
It's about the team.

1503
01:54:39,146 --> 01:54:40,604
S. Jeeva.

1504
01:54:41,874 --> 01:54:43,166
Sweety Singh.

1505
01:54:43,592 --> 01:54:44,967
Neha Ghadge.

1506
01:54:45,342 --> 01:54:46,300
Jaya Nigam.

1507
01:54:53,607 --> 01:54:54,815
Come on, girls.

1508
01:54:55,265 --> 01:54:56,265
Come on.

1509
01:55:03,599 --> 01:55:05,182
When will you play, mummy?

1510
01:55:05,432 --> 01:55:08,349
Prashant, please take Adi
and leave.

1511
01:55:12,765 --> 01:55:15,432
Asia Kabaddi Championship's
final match.

1512
01:55:15,640 --> 01:55:17,849
India vs Iran.

1513
01:55:18,640 --> 01:55:20,515
First raid by India.

1514
01:55:20,640 --> 01:55:24,432
Iran wins the toss and invites India
to raid first.

1515
01:55:24,515 --> 01:55:28,265
Come on, girls!
We have to win the game.

1516
01:55:28,390 --> 01:55:29,515
Send Jaya in.

1517
01:55:29,682 --> 01:55:32,974
India is feeling the pressure.

1518
01:55:33,265 --> 01:55:36,807
It'll be interesting to see
what strategy India will adopt.

1519
01:55:36,974 --> 01:55:38,557
Applause!

1520
01:55:40,099 --> 01:55:42,182
Both teams, get ready.

1521
01:55:42,265 --> 01:55:44,057
Raider, you take raid
after the whistle.

1522
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:48,599
Jaya Nigam from India,
for the first raid.

1523
01:55:48,640 --> 01:55:50,224
Game on!

1524
01:55:50,307 --> 01:55:52,974
Iran will thrash us and Jaya, them.

1525
01:55:53,182 --> 01:55:55,849
After an 8-year sabbatical,

1526
01:55:55,974 --> 01:55:57,765
Jaya Nigam returns.

1527
01:55:58,765 --> 01:56:02,182
She looks to earn a point
for her country.

1528
01:56:02,307 --> 01:56:04,515
She shuffles, waiting
for the right moment.

1529
01:56:04,682 --> 01:56:05,724
Jaya Nigam.

1530
01:56:06,474 --> 01:56:08,515
Iran giving her no chance.

1531
01:56:09,640 --> 01:56:12,349
Crossing the bonus line,
she tries to make her way back.

1532
01:56:12,932 --> 01:56:13,515
Bonus!

1533
01:56:13,557 --> 01:56:15,057
She believes she's got a point.

1534
01:56:15,182 --> 01:56:17,349
But the referee denies it.

1535
01:56:17,432 --> 01:56:19,015
There seems to be some confusion.

1536
01:56:19,099 --> 01:56:20,807
Smita Tambe argues with the referee.

1537
01:56:20,932 --> 01:56:21,599
Smita.

1538
01:56:21,682 --> 01:56:23,974
The replay will confirm
what happened.

1539
01:56:26,432 --> 01:56:30,140
Clearly, Jaya Nigam's foot
didn't cross the bonus line.

1540
01:56:30,349 --> 01:56:31,974
No point for India.

1541
01:56:32,182 --> 01:56:34,557
Iran - 0, India - 0

1542
01:56:35,265 --> 01:56:37,557
Latifi from Iran
comes for a raid.

1543
01:56:37,640 --> 01:56:40,557
Latifi has played brilliantly
in this tournament.

1544
01:56:41,099 --> 01:56:42,182
She shuffles.

1545
01:56:42,265 --> 01:56:44,015
She dodges smartly.

1546
01:56:44,182 --> 01:56:47,182
Latifi tries to grab points.

1547
01:56:50,015 --> 01:56:51,265
An ankle-lock.

1548
01:56:51,349 --> 01:56:55,140
But, a failed attempt by Smita.
Latifi back to her side.

1549
01:56:55,349 --> 01:56:57,224
Three Indian players out!

1550
01:56:57,765 --> 01:57:00,057
Iran starts with a bang.

1551
01:57:00,140 --> 01:57:02,432
What are you all doing?

1552
01:57:02,557 --> 01:57:03,807
A bad start for India.

1553
01:57:03,974 --> 01:57:06,265
The Indian coach clearly upset.

1554
01:57:06,349 --> 01:57:07,390
Raider safe.

1555
01:57:07,474 --> 01:57:08,599
Super raid.

1556
01:57:08,765 --> 01:57:10,765
3 points to Iran.

1557
01:57:10,849 --> 01:57:12,807
Just five minutes left
in the first half.

1558
01:57:13,057 --> 01:57:14,765
Iran - 12, India - 7

1559
01:57:14,974 --> 01:57:17,224
As predicted at the start of the match

1560
01:57:17,599 --> 01:57:21,307
Iran gives India a tough fight.

1561
01:57:27,807 --> 01:57:28,849
Stick to the right.

1562
01:57:34,557 --> 01:57:35,599
Mummy's playing!

1563
01:57:35,765 --> 01:57:38,390
Mummy's finally playing.

1564
01:57:38,807 --> 01:57:40,557
India in a tough situation.

1565
01:57:40,724 --> 01:57:43,099
Nisha Das, India's raider.

1566
01:57:43,515 --> 01:57:45,765
Iran's defense looks strong.

1567
01:57:45,974 --> 01:57:47,849
There's a lot riding on Nisha.

1568
01:57:47,932 --> 01:57:49,849
She looks for an opportunity.

1569
01:57:52,265 --> 01:57:54,015
A fantastic touch point!

1570
01:57:54,307 --> 01:57:56,765
Nisha skillfully dodges her way out.

1571
01:57:59,140 --> 01:58:01,474
She safely lands on her side!

1572
01:58:01,724 --> 01:58:03,765
She earns points for India.

1573
01:58:03,974 --> 01:58:05,015
Nisha Das.

1574
01:58:05,640 --> 01:58:06,724
For first half.

1575
01:58:07,557 --> 01:58:09,265
And this completes the first half.

1576
01:58:10,057 --> 01:58:12,807
India still in trouble.

1577
01:58:13,099 --> 01:58:16,390
India - 12, Iran - 18

1578
01:58:17,724 --> 01:58:19,724
Both teams switch sides.

1579
01:58:20,224 --> 01:58:23,224
India needs to restrategise.

1580
01:58:23,765 --> 01:58:25,515
To look for solutions.

1581
01:58:26,515 --> 01:58:28,557
Jaya! Here!

1582
01:58:29,140 --> 01:58:32,057
Grandma, let mummy play.
Don't disturb her.

1583
01:58:32,182 --> 01:58:33,099
Quiet!

1584
01:58:36,557 --> 01:58:39,057
Ten minutes to go.

1585
01:58:39,140 --> 01:58:41,515
And once again from Iran,
Latifi raids.

1586
01:58:41,599 --> 01:58:43,599
She's looking for a chance.

1587
01:58:44,640 --> 01:58:47,432
She breaks away and
makes her way through the lobby.

1588
01:58:47,807 --> 01:58:50,515
Has the line been touched?

1589
01:58:51,015 --> 01:58:53,140
Super raid! 3-points, Iran.

1590
01:58:53,224 --> 01:58:55,140
The referee gives Iran the points.

1591
01:58:55,224 --> 01:58:57,849
The Indian team is not convinced
by the referee's decision.

1592
01:58:57,890 --> 01:58:59,307
-Line touch...
-It's out.

1593
01:58:59,390 --> 01:59:03,140
The replay confirms that Latifi
touched the line.

1594
01:59:03,432 --> 01:59:04,890
Well played.

1595
01:59:05,140 --> 01:59:09,557
It's a super raid.
Three players from India out again.

1596
01:59:12,224 --> 01:59:15,140
Neha should've pulled as well.

1597
01:59:15,224 --> 01:59:16,432
She was clearly out.

1598
01:59:19,432 --> 01:59:20,474
What happened?

1599
01:59:20,557 --> 01:59:22,265
Mummy's out again.

1600
01:59:22,724 --> 01:59:26,807
This final is slowly slipping out
of India's hands.

1601
01:59:30,140 --> 01:59:31,765
Time's running out.

1602
01:59:32,307 --> 01:59:34,057
So are their options.

1603
01:59:35,265 --> 01:59:37,557
Jeeva raids.

1604
01:59:38,099 --> 01:59:41,432
With no raiders,
India doesn't have many choices.

1605
01:59:41,515 --> 01:59:45,849
Jeeva tries, Iran doesn't give an inch.

1606
01:59:46,307 --> 01:59:48,057
An empty raid.

1607
01:59:48,224 --> 01:59:51,765
India is in trouble.
Spectators losing hope.

1608
01:59:51,932 --> 01:59:54,599
Nothing's happening.
Jaya is also not playing.

1609
01:59:55,599 --> 01:59:57,224
We're stuck with an empty raid.

1610
01:59:57,682 --> 01:59:59,390
-Iran's thrashing us.
-What?

1611
01:59:59,640 --> 02:00:01,307
I mean, Iran's playing very well.

1612
02:00:05,294 --> 02:00:08,419
Just two more minutes
in the second half.

1613
02:00:08,807 --> 02:00:11,390
Latifi from Iran returns.

1614
02:00:11,599 --> 02:00:14,932
Latifi intends to further strengthen
Iran's stance.

1615
02:00:15,182 --> 02:00:18,932
India is far from its goal.

1616
02:00:21,265 --> 02:00:22,390
A back kick attempt.

1617
02:00:23,390 --> 02:00:26,349
Jeeva's block and a fantastic raid.

1618
02:00:26,724 --> 02:00:28,765
A great raid.

1619
02:00:28,932 --> 02:00:31,765
Latifi manages another point.

1620
02:00:31,974 --> 02:00:34,182
India has no response.

1621
02:00:34,640 --> 02:00:38,640
The cup looking unlikely for India.

1622
02:00:39,140 --> 02:00:41,349
Just a few minutes left
for the match to end.

1623
02:00:41,474 --> 02:00:43,599
Iran - 31, India - 29

1624
02:00:43,724 --> 02:00:46,140
Captain Smita comes for a raid.
Diversion technique!

1625
02:00:46,349 --> 02:00:52,224
Neha Ghadge raids.
She tries to score a point for India.

1626
02:00:54,140 --> 02:00:56,224
Neha's back kick.
No... a touch attempt.

1627
02:00:57,640 --> 02:00:59,682
Neha, tries very hard.

1628
02:00:59,807 --> 02:01:00,890
But, fails.

1629
02:01:01,099 --> 02:01:02,765
Another empty raid.

1630
02:01:03,015 --> 02:01:04,182
A second failed attempt.

1631
02:01:04,265 --> 02:01:06,182
India in trouble.

1632
02:01:06,529 --> 02:01:08,570
The score hasn't changed.

1633
02:01:09,765 --> 02:01:12,265
Only two Indian defenders
on the mat.

1634
02:01:12,474 --> 02:01:13,474
Tough!

1635
02:01:13,557 --> 02:01:15,307
Yousafi attempts a raid.

1636
02:01:15,390 --> 02:01:18,682
This could be India's last chance
if both players are out.

1637
02:01:19,224 --> 02:01:20,765
India in its weakest position.

1638
02:01:23,765 --> 02:01:26,515
An ankle-lock by Neha.
Smita tries to block.

1639
02:01:26,682 --> 02:01:27,640
Yes!

1640
02:01:27,765 --> 02:01:29,265
They've got 2 points.

1641
02:01:29,349 --> 02:01:31,307
Super tackle, 2 points, India.

1642
02:01:31,474 --> 02:01:33,349
Great move by Smita.

1643
02:01:33,599 --> 02:01:35,140
Score - equal.

1644
02:01:35,432 --> 02:01:37,724
India still has hope.

1645
02:01:38,057 --> 02:01:39,682
And with that,
Jaya Nigam's back on the mat.

1646
02:01:39,682 --> 02:01:41,057
This is our last chance...

1647
02:01:41,140 --> 02:01:43,140
This is a 'do-or-die' raid for India.

1648
02:01:43,224 --> 02:01:45,057
We have to score.

1649
02:01:45,099 --> 02:01:47,682
Since the last two raids by India
were empty,

1650
02:01:47,765 --> 02:01:50,849
if this third attempt fails,
India loses.

1651
02:01:50,932 --> 02:01:53,182
Jaya, this is a 'do-or-die' raid.

1652
02:01:53,349 --> 02:01:55,640
It's all up to you now.

1653
02:01:55,682 --> 02:01:58,015
Jaya Nigam gets ready for a raid.

1654
02:01:58,515 --> 02:02:00,515
She has a big responsibility.

1655
02:02:00,890 --> 02:02:02,265
India's final hope.

1656
02:02:02,474 --> 02:02:03,390
Jaya Nigam.

1657
02:02:03,557 --> 02:02:05,265
Can Jaya do it?

1658
02:02:05,890 --> 02:02:07,349
Jaya tries her best.

1659
02:02:07,515 --> 02:02:10,224
She has to score one point
at any cost.

1660
02:02:10,515 --> 02:02:11,432
Jaya.

1661
02:02:21,057 --> 02:02:22,515
I have a child.

1662
02:02:22,765 --> 02:02:24,682
What if I break my neck?

1663
02:02:32,599 --> 02:02:34,515
Why did you come here?

1664
02:02:34,724 --> 02:02:36,557
To test my limit.

1665
02:02:38,932 --> 02:02:42,890
Jaya's getting breathless
while the line seems further away.

1666
02:02:44,599 --> 02:02:46,599
This is my limit.
I can't go beyond it.

1667
02:02:48,724 --> 02:02:50,974
Will Jaya touch the line?

1668
02:02:51,515 --> 02:02:53,974
Jaya lunges!

1669
02:02:54,224 --> 02:02:57,599
And it's a touchdown!

1670
02:02:57,682 --> 02:02:59,265
Super raid!

1671
02:02:59,349 --> 02:03:02,890
India wins the Asia Kabaddi Championship!

1672
02:03:04,140 --> 02:03:09,057
Team India, who were on the back foot

1673
02:03:09,224 --> 02:03:13,508
and struggling to survive against Iran,

1674
02:03:14,382 --> 02:03:19,718
have finally emerged triumphant.

1675
02:03:20,557 --> 02:03:22,015
What a comeback for India!

1676
02:03:22,224 --> 02:03:24,807
And what a comeback for Jaya Nigam.

1677
02:03:36,599 --> 02:03:38,390
Well done, girls!

1678
02:03:38,682 --> 02:03:41,515
-Sir, can I have your phone please.
-Of course!

1679
02:03:41,599 --> 02:03:43,390
Today you deserve it.
Well done.

1680
02:03:44,224 --> 02:03:46,099
Good, girls!

1681
02:03:51,474 --> 02:03:52,599
Prashant.

1682
02:03:55,390 --> 02:03:58,265
I shouldn't have sent you all back.

1683
02:04:02,349 --> 02:04:04,724
We'd never leave you alone so easily.

1684
02:04:05,807 --> 02:04:07,849
Prashant! Adi!

1685
02:04:11,474 --> 02:04:12,474
Mummy!

1686
02:04:15,140 --> 02:04:17,015
You were here.

1687
02:05:00,271 --> 02:05:01,229
Prashant, listen...

1688
02:05:01,289 --> 02:05:03,432
I'll turn off the taps, light, gas.

1689
02:05:03,557 --> 02:05:05,765
I'll eat home food.

1690
02:05:05,849 --> 02:05:07,224
Enough!

1691
02:05:07,249 --> 02:05:09,874
I've had 5 ml Zincovit.
I've filled my water bottle.

1692
02:05:10,015 --> 02:05:12,349
I'll finish my homework
and then go to play.

1693
02:05:12,390 --> 02:05:13,515
I love you.

1694
02:05:15,020 --> 02:05:15,978
Your turn.

1695
02:05:17,224 --> 02:05:18,265
Love you, too.

1696
02:05:31,140 --> 02:05:32,182
At least take a look.

1697
02:05:34,640 --> 02:05:35,682
He's too skinny!

1698
02:05:37,725 --> 02:05:38,767
Have you buttered it?

1699
02:05:39,001 --> 02:05:41,640
Here are my blessings.
You'll find a good man.

1700
02:05:41,682 --> 02:05:42,974
Then why have you got me here?

1701
02:05:43,849 --> 02:05:45,390
It's teaming with oldies.

1702
02:06:11,432 --> 02:06:14,682
Tell me when you need me.
I'll be there.

1703
02:06:39,151 --> 02:06:40,569
What are you getting me
for my birthday?

1704
02:06:40,849 --> 02:06:42,140
Just two months left.

1705
02:06:43,140 --> 02:06:44,432
I gifted you the guitar.

1706
02:06:45,765 --> 02:06:47,057
Give her the guitar.

1707
02:06:47,390 --> 02:06:48,057
This one.

1708
02:06:48,099 --> 02:06:48,807
No way!

1709
02:06:49,557 --> 02:06:51,807
I've had a change of heart

1710
02:06:51,849 --> 02:06:54,474
and I feel that I can stay here
after marriage.

1711
02:06:54,544 --> 02:06:56,044
Do you accept?

1712
02:06:56,966 --> 02:06:59,632
Shall I call Jaya
and give her the good news?
