3
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,260
So I'll be Batman for Halloween.
You can be Alfred.

4
00:00:35,262 --> 00:00:36,428
- Alfred?
- Yeah.

5
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,130
Why not Robin, his sidekick?

6
00:00:38,132 --> 00:00:39,833
Batman doesn't need a sidekick.

7
00:00:39,835 --> 00:00:42,535
He needs somebody to pick up
his dry cleaning.

8
00:00:42,537 --> 00:00:43,669
- Wait.
- What?

9
00:00:43,671 --> 00:00:45,971
- That's Rita.
- So what?

10
00:00:45,973 --> 00:00:48,074
So what?
This is my chance.

11
00:00:48,076 --> 00:00:49,541
Are you kidding me?

12
00:00:49,543 --> 00:00:51,410
Those are
high school girls, Jake.

13
00:00:51,412 --> 00:00:53,312
Listen, walk like
10 steps behind me.

14
00:00:53,314 --> 00:00:56,049
When I reach her,
go hide behind Mrs. Gomez's bush

15
00:00:56,051 --> 00:00:57,416
and wait for us to leave.

16
00:00:57,418 --> 00:00:59,251
It's Miss Gomez.
She got a divorce.

17
00:00:59,253 --> 00:01:01,321
Just hide behind
the Mexican lady's bush, Sam.

18
00:01:01,323 --> 00:01:03,089
Why can't I just walk ahead
of you and go to school?

19
00:01:03,091 --> 00:01:04,791
Because if Rita rides
the tard cart,

20
00:01:04,793 --> 00:01:08,097
I don't want to walk the rest
of the way to school alone.

21
00:01:57,145 --> 00:02:00,613
So, Mr. Sanderson,
is this right?

22
00:02:00,615 --> 00:02:04,186
Mr. Sanderson,
I think this is right.

23
00:02:08,156 --> 00:02:10,055
Nope.

24
00:02:10,057 --> 00:02:13,226
No, it's wrong.

25
00:02:13,228 --> 00:02:16,729
You're never going
to get that one right.

26
00:02:16,731 --> 00:02:18,597
No, no, no.

27
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:21,266
I meant even someone
old enough to take the SATs

28
00:02:21,268 --> 00:02:23,772
would have trouble with that.

29
00:02:26,874 --> 00:02:28,974
Well...

30
00:02:28,976 --> 00:02:30,710
maybe not.

31
00:02:30,712 --> 00:02:32,779
But you're 11,
for Christ's sakes.

32
00:02:32,781 --> 00:02:34,781
It's not a big deal you're not
smart enough for this.

33
00:02:34,783 --> 00:02:36,782
My mom thinks
I'm smart enough for it.

34
00:02:36,784 --> 00:02:39,185
You know what?
Your mom's delusional.

35
00:02:39,187 --> 00:02:41,888
Sam, I don't think you're
the right person for this job.

36
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:45,258
Just remember, Linda, I got
a perfect score on my SATs,

37
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,825
and I never went to college.

38
00:02:46,827 --> 00:02:50,129
Great SAT score
doesn't mean a great future.

39
00:02:50,131 --> 00:02:52,301
You owe me $60 for the hour.

40
00:02:56,237 --> 00:02:58,238
My rental just got a flat.

41
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,240
No, I've never changed a tire
in my life.

42
00:03:00,242 --> 00:03:03,609
I'm not gonna start now.
Just gonna jog it out.

43
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:06,812
I don't know that I want you
to meet my dad just yet or ever.

44
00:03:06,814 --> 00:03:08,615
I'm literally seeing him
as I walk down the aisle,

45
00:03:08,617 --> 00:03:10,449
meeting his new wife as she
takes off her goddamn veil.

46
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:12,585
It's a quick in and out.
What the fuck?

47
00:03:12,587 --> 00:03:15,221
No, no. I'm not involving
you because I love you.

48
00:03:15,223 --> 00:03:18,258
Listen, everything
you don't like about me,

49
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,359
that's my dad times a million.

50
00:03:20,361 --> 00:03:22,895
I really don't wanna fight...

51
00:03:44,552 --> 00:03:48,356
Oh, fuck. Don't move.
Let me get your dad.

52
00:03:53,228 --> 00:03:54,760
Jakey?

53
00:03:54,762 --> 00:03:57,697
There you are.
We thought we lost you, man.

54
00:03:57,699 --> 00:03:59,765
I was just watching the Yanks
in the other room.

55
00:03:59,767 --> 00:04:02,769
They played her commercial
like six times.

56
00:04:02,771 --> 00:04:04,370
Jersey Junkers!

57
00:04:04,372 --> 00:04:06,906
We'll kill you
with lower prices.

58
00:04:06,908 --> 00:04:09,309
Do you recognize the voice?
She does all the voices.

59
00:04:09,311 --> 00:04:11,080
I sent you the YouTube, right?

60
00:04:14,983 --> 00:04:16,849
How do you feel?

61
00:04:19,087 --> 00:04:23,922
- Come again, Jake?
- What... happened?

62
00:04:23,924 --> 00:04:27,227
Oh, well, uh, you got into
a fight with a car, kiddo.

63
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:30,362
The car won.

64
00:04:30,364 --> 00:04:33,765
Kiddo, I want you to formally
meet my beautiful bride.

65
00:04:33,767 --> 00:04:35,001
This is Cassandra.

66
00:04:35,003 --> 00:04:37,436
You got married?

67
00:04:37,438 --> 00:04:40,939
Of course.
We got the skinny on you,

68
00:04:40,941 --> 00:04:43,676
and then, you know, we just
went on with the ceremony.

69
00:04:43,678 --> 00:04:45,345
I am exhausted.

70
00:04:45,347 --> 00:04:49,114
The deejay played every song
I asked him to.

71
00:04:49,116 --> 00:04:50,450
Your father.

72
00:04:50,452 --> 00:04:52,654
I got video of it.
Don't worry.

73
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:01,227
Don't you have tutoring today?

74
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:02,861
Nah.
I think I got fired.

75
00:05:02,863 --> 00:05:04,731
Why would they fire you?

76
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:06,799
You got a perfect score
on your SATs.

77
00:05:06,801 --> 00:05:09,135
There's no better tutor
in this town.

78
00:05:09,137 --> 00:05:11,136
I was tutoring a 10-year-old.

79
00:05:11,138 --> 00:05:13,405
They can't take the SATs
that young.

80
00:05:13,407 --> 00:05:14,407
Exactly.

81
00:05:14,409 --> 00:05:16,109
Kids aren't smart enough then.

82
00:05:16,111 --> 00:05:17,109
Right.

83
00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:18,977
Well, that's just silly.

84
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:21,013
I know.

85
00:05:21,015 --> 00:05:24,450
You win some, you lose some.

86
00:05:24,452 --> 00:05:27,623
I'll just pick up some more
shifts at St. Vincent's.

87
00:05:29,257 --> 00:05:31,691
I'll figure it out, Mom.

88
00:05:31,693 --> 00:05:34,092
We'll be okay.

89
00:05:34,094 --> 00:05:36,729
I don't know.

90
00:05:36,731 --> 00:05:39,232
We'll figure it out.

91
00:05:39,234 --> 00:05:41,801
Did you hear about Jacob?

92
00:05:41,803 --> 00:05:45,104
- Who?
- Jacob. Jake.

93
00:05:45,106 --> 00:05:46,838
No.
What about him?

94
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,640
Jake, everything's
gonna be fine.

95
00:05:48,642 --> 00:05:50,676
You got like a month of
physical therapy, and that's it.

96
00:05:50,678 --> 00:05:53,479
No big deal. Plus you got
the run of the house,

97
00:05:53,481 --> 00:05:55,213
and we just renovated
and everything.

98
00:05:55,215 --> 00:05:56,616
What the fuck
are you talking about?

99
00:05:56,618 --> 00:05:58,818
We're gonna get out
of your hair, kiddo.

100
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,285
No big deal.

101
00:06:00,287 --> 00:06:02,854
Hey, where are you going?

102
00:06:02,856 --> 00:06:05,792
- It's our honeymoon, kiddo.
- Don't call me that.

103
00:06:05,794 --> 00:06:08,660
Your honeymoon?
I can't be alone.

104
00:06:08,662 --> 00:06:10,862
Well, you can't come with us,
Jake, that's nuts.

105
00:06:10,864 --> 00:06:12,498
Whoa, whoa! Wait!

106
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,038
I don't wanna go with you.
I want you to stay.

107
00:06:18,606 --> 00:06:22,308
Jake, you're gonna get in
a good five or six car accidents

108
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,743
in your life.

109
00:06:23,745 --> 00:06:26,546
I only get one honeymoon
with this beautiful woman.

110
00:06:26,548 --> 00:06:28,047
Be reasonable.

111
00:06:28,049 --> 00:06:30,616
Now, look, we're gonna push our
flights back a couple of days,

112
00:06:30,618 --> 00:06:33,318
and when we do leave, you're
gonna get the best in-house care

113
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,491
money can buy, okay?

114
00:06:37,424 --> 00:06:38,693
Come on!

115
00:06:40,495 --> 00:06:41,594
Go!

116
00:07:13,527 --> 00:07:17,130
<i>...is best
known for its birds.</i>

117
00:07:17,132 --> 00:07:19,364
<i>They gather here each winter
in great numbers.</i>

118
00:07:19,366 --> 00:07:21,770
I got it.

119
00:07:25,306 --> 00:07:27,109
You call those specialists yet?

120
00:07:30,245 --> 00:07:31,710
You're leaving tomorrow.

121
00:07:31,712 --> 00:07:36,816
Yeah. I just got to confirm,
you know, a few things.

122
00:07:36,818 --> 00:07:40,253
Hey, Jake, there's someone
named Sam here to see you.

123
00:07:40,255 --> 00:07:42,587
- Sam?
- Yeah.

124
00:07:42,589 --> 00:07:44,823
Like a squirrely little
Jewish kid?

125
00:07:44,825 --> 00:07:48,727
I don't know. He could
be Italian or something.

126
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:51,463
Hey, buddy!
What's going on?

127
00:07:51,465 --> 00:07:54,467
- How are you, Mr. Kitner?
- Fine, fine, fine.

128
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:57,837
So, what you got going on
these days?

129
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:01,073
Nothing much.
Heard Jake got into an accident.

130
00:08:01,075 --> 00:08:03,176
Yeah, yeah,
on the way to my wedding.

131
00:08:03,178 --> 00:08:04,576
Selfish son of a bitch.

132
00:08:04,578 --> 00:08:07,746
It's always got to be
about him, right?

133
00:08:07,748 --> 00:08:09,448
All finished?

134
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,515
Yeah.

135
00:08:10,517 --> 00:08:12,350
Hey, Cassandra, do me a favor.

136
00:08:12,352 --> 00:08:15,354
Grab that desk lamp,
plug it in over there.

137
00:08:15,356 --> 00:08:16,989
Sure thing, kiddo.

138
00:08:16,991 --> 00:08:18,424
Ugh...

139
00:08:18,426 --> 00:08:21,193
So, anyway, you working?

140
00:08:21,195 --> 00:08:23,796
You got anything...
Making any money?

141
00:08:23,798 --> 00:08:26,833
Actually, times are
kinda tough right now.

142
00:08:26,835 --> 00:08:28,868
I just lost a client.

143
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,303
Oh, yeah?
What do you do for a living?

144
00:08:31,305 --> 00:08:36,274
I'm a tutor, uh,
for the SATs.

145
00:08:36,276 --> 00:08:39,878
So, you know, just, uh...

146
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,913
- Is Jake here?
- Hmm?

147
00:08:41,915 --> 00:08:43,782
- Jake?
- Yeah, no, totally.

148
00:08:43,784 --> 00:08:46,351
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah, run up and see him.

149
00:08:46,353 --> 00:08:48,086
- Cool.
- Yeah.

150
00:08:48,088 --> 00:08:50,156
Uh, catch me on your way back.

151
00:08:50,158 --> 00:08:51,592
Yeah.

152
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,327
Would you like
something to drink?

153
00:08:55,329 --> 00:08:57,732
Maybe a glass of water.

154
00:09:03,237 --> 00:09:04,237
Who's there?

155
00:09:04,239 --> 00:09:06,138
It's Sam, man.

156
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,141
I heard about the accident.

157
00:09:08,143 --> 00:09:09,609
- Who?
- Sam.

158
00:09:09,611 --> 00:09:11,811
Sam Sanderson
from back when we were kids.

159
00:09:11,813 --> 00:09:12,845
Who's talking?

160
00:09:12,847 --> 00:09:15,049
Sam Sanderson.

161
00:09:16,885 --> 00:09:18,250
Geez, man.

162
00:09:18,252 --> 00:09:19,851
It's been a long time.

163
00:09:19,853 --> 00:09:22,654
Yeah, yeah.

164
00:09:22,656 --> 00:09:24,356
I hear you're doing really well.

165
00:09:24,358 --> 00:09:26,526
Well, I've been better,
considering.

166
00:09:26,528 --> 00:09:30,162
You know, I was considering
calling you.

167
00:09:30,164 --> 00:09:32,565
Just been a lot of shit
between us.

168
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:34,800
It's been a really long,
long time.

169
00:09:34,802 --> 00:09:36,301
I can't say that enough.

170
00:09:36,303 --> 00:09:38,638
Long time from what?

171
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,071
Ohh!

172
00:09:40,073 --> 00:09:42,175
I can't see you.
My vision's going in and out.

173
00:09:42,177 --> 00:09:43,643
Are you okay?
Should I get your dad?

174
00:09:43,645 --> 00:09:47,979
My dad? My dad's been
dead for many years.

175
00:09:47,981 --> 00:09:49,882
They took him away
a long time ago.

176
00:09:49,884 --> 00:09:51,053
Who did?

177
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,085
The Spaniards.

178
00:09:54,087 --> 00:09:55,754
What?

179
00:09:55,756 --> 00:10:00,258
Buddy, buddy, there's a miracle
on 34th Street.

180
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,597
You've gotta help me find it.

181
00:10:04,198 --> 00:10:06,199
Who...

182
00:10:06,201 --> 00:10:08,633
are...

183
00:10:08,635 --> 00:10:10,235
you?!

184
00:10:10,237 --> 00:10:12,238
I'm Sam! Sam! I'm Sam!
It's me, Jakey!

185
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,508
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!
I don't...

186
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,511
I don't remember anything.

187
00:10:18,513 --> 00:10:20,546
They told me
I got into an accident,

188
00:10:20,548 --> 00:10:22,748
but I don't remember you!

189
00:10:24,851 --> 00:10:26,185
Thank you.

190
00:10:26,187 --> 00:10:28,921
I'm sorry.
I didn't get your name.

191
00:10:28,923 --> 00:10:29,922
It's Cassandra.

192
00:10:29,924 --> 00:10:31,657
Thanks, Cassandra.

193
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:32,792
No problem.

194
00:10:32,794 --> 00:10:34,726
Cassandra was born
in Tenafly, New Jersey.

195
00:10:34,728 --> 00:10:36,428
She graduated
from Montclair State

196
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:37,997
with a degree
in fashion history.

197
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:39,297
Her favorite color is turquoise,

198
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:41,834
and she likes swimming
for exercise.

199
00:10:41,836 --> 00:10:43,034
Hi, Cassandra.

200
00:10:43,036 --> 00:10:44,305
Hmm.

201
00:10:46,573 --> 00:10:47,508
Who are you?

202
00:10:50,211 --> 00:10:53,311
Fucking piece of shit!

203
00:10:53,313 --> 00:10:55,681
Who's a piece of shit?

204
00:10:55,683 --> 00:10:57,682
Who's talking?

205
00:10:57,684 --> 00:11:00,085
Who are you?!

206
00:11:00,087 --> 00:11:02,524
Sam?

207
00:11:03,658 --> 00:11:06,825
Is Jake suffering
from memory loss?

208
00:11:06,827 --> 00:11:08,694
Not that I know of.

209
00:11:08,696 --> 00:11:10,196
Didn't think so.

210
00:11:10,198 --> 00:11:12,130
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

211
00:11:12,132 --> 00:11:13,798
- Where you going?
- Home.

212
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,433
What happened?

213
00:11:15,435 --> 00:11:18,070
- Your son's an asshole.
- I know, but what happened?

214
00:11:18,072 --> 00:11:20,473
- I'm going home.
- Hey, hey, hey, wait, wait.

215
00:11:20,475 --> 00:11:23,575
Listen, Cassie and I,
we just got married.

216
00:11:23,577 --> 00:11:25,610
- We're going on our honeymoon.
- Congratulations.

217
00:11:25,612 --> 00:11:28,480
No, wait. Do you know how
expensive in-home care is?

218
00:11:28,482 --> 00:11:29,981
'Cause I didn't.

219
00:11:29,983 --> 00:11:31,883
I was throwing the term around
like it was nothing,

220
00:11:31,885 --> 00:11:33,386
and then I looked it up.

221
00:11:33,388 --> 00:11:35,053
Well, let him pay for it.
He's got all the money.

222
00:11:35,055 --> 00:11:37,290
He's not doing as well
as he likes to sing about.

223
00:11:37,292 --> 00:11:39,292
It costs a lot of money
to put a piece of metal

224
00:11:39,294 --> 00:11:40,960
in somebody's shoulder.

225
00:11:40,962 --> 00:11:45,564
Now, listen, we are gonna get
onto that plane to St. Barts.

226
00:11:45,566 --> 00:11:48,600
I mean, come on!
I don't deserve this!

227
00:11:48,602 --> 00:11:50,002
So how about it?

228
00:11:50,004 --> 00:11:52,971
He's gonna be in a wheelchair
for like another week,

229
00:11:52,973 --> 00:11:55,508
and then after that,
it's gonna be a lot easier.

230
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:59,512
So do your oldest friend
a big favor.

231
00:11:59,514 --> 00:12:02,715
Stay with Jake while we're gone.

232
00:12:02,717 --> 00:12:04,383
Absolutely not.

233
00:12:04,385 --> 00:12:06,252
I'll pay you $750.

234
00:12:06,254 --> 00:12:07,887
How long do I
have to be here for?

235
00:12:07,889 --> 00:12:09,120
A month.

236
00:12:09,122 --> 00:12:10,523
1,000.

237
00:12:10,525 --> 00:12:11,423
Deal.

238
00:12:11,425 --> 00:12:14,659
500 now,
500 when we get back.

239
00:12:14,661 --> 00:12:16,662
Now, we're leaving
in the morning.

240
00:12:16,664 --> 00:12:19,632
I mean, you gotta stay here.
You understand that, right?

241
00:12:19,634 --> 00:12:21,633
I can't have you
going home at night

242
00:12:21,635 --> 00:12:23,301
just in case
something happens.

243
00:12:23,303 --> 00:12:25,638
Are you sure you're okay
with me staying here?

244
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,872
I'm not a nurse.

245
00:12:26,874 --> 00:12:28,673
You work with kids.

246
00:12:28,675 --> 00:12:30,475
Not the same thing.

247
00:12:30,477 --> 00:12:33,412
It's fine.
Listen, I wouldn't do this

248
00:12:33,414 --> 00:12:35,848
unless I trust
that everything will be okay.

249
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:39,821
I mean, it's not like
I'm a shitty father, right?

250
00:12:50,898 --> 00:12:52,567
You gotta kidding me.

251
00:13:11,752 --> 00:13:13,853
Hello!

252
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,588
- What's going on, dummy?
- Who are you?

253
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:18,224
- Drop it. I talked to your dad.
- Who?

254
00:13:18,226 --> 00:13:19,557
Eat shit, Jake.

255
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:21,359
I'm gonna go downstairs,
make a sandwich.

256
00:13:21,361 --> 00:13:22,927
You want something?

257
00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:24,196
Yes.

258
00:13:24,198 --> 00:13:26,201
All right.

259
00:13:28,669 --> 00:13:31,137
Is there a note or something
down there?

260
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:33,172
No.

261
00:13:33,174 --> 00:13:35,807
Why would there be?

262
00:13:35,809 --> 00:13:37,143
For the nurse.

263
00:13:37,145 --> 00:13:39,577
My dad said he was gonna
get me a live-in nurse.

264
00:13:39,579 --> 00:13:41,614
Fuck you, Jake!

265
00:13:41,616 --> 00:13:43,081
What?

266
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,484
If you call me that
while I'm here,

267
00:13:45,486 --> 00:13:48,186
I'm gonna walk out,
and you're gonna shit yourself

268
00:13:48,188 --> 00:13:50,122
and starve to death
in that bed.

269
00:13:50,124 --> 00:13:51,123
What?

270
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,858
Did I stutter?

271
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,596
Don't call me that, Jake.

272
00:13:59,232 --> 00:14:01,633
- It's turkey.
- Are you kidding?

273
00:14:01,635 --> 00:14:03,869
Your dad left food money,
but that's the best I can do

274
00:14:03,871 --> 00:14:05,271
with what's in the fridge.

275
00:14:05,273 --> 00:14:06,538
Is this a joke?

276
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,307
It's the best I can do,
considering.

277
00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:11,579
They're on an airplane, Jake.

278
00:14:14,682 --> 00:14:16,818
You want anything to drink?

279
00:14:18,385 --> 00:14:22,256
Don't try to move,
or I'll hobble you.

280
00:14:26,092 --> 00:14:27,493
Hey!

281
00:14:27,495 --> 00:14:30,298
I have to go to the bathroom!

282
00:14:31,832 --> 00:14:34,066
Watch the door, asshole.

283
00:14:34,068 --> 00:14:35,500
This door isn't wide enough.

284
00:14:35,502 --> 00:14:37,369
Why would my dad's
second-floor bathroom

285
00:14:37,371 --> 00:14:38,870
be wheelchair accessible?

286
00:14:38,872 --> 00:14:40,372
The default for any bathroom

287
00:14:40,374 --> 00:14:42,240
should be that it be
wheelchair accessible.

288
00:14:42,242 --> 00:14:45,244
Right! Why don't you go ahead
and pioneer that one, nurse?

289
00:14:45,246 --> 00:14:47,213
Second-floor wheelchair
accessible bathrooms.

290
00:14:47,215 --> 00:14:49,047
Great idea.

291
00:14:49,049 --> 00:14:50,615
All right, whatever.

292
00:14:50,617 --> 00:14:54,220
Look, Sam, come on!
I'm messing with you.

293
00:14:54,222 --> 00:14:56,489
Come back.

294
00:14:56,491 --> 00:14:58,290
Sam!

295
00:14:58,292 --> 00:15:00,625
I'm shitting my pants!

296
00:15:00,627 --> 00:15:01,960
- Easy.
- Yeah.

297
00:15:01,962 --> 00:15:03,231
Okay.

298
00:15:08,435 --> 00:15:10,402
Hey.

299
00:15:10,404 --> 00:15:13,571
Can't shit through
my pants, buddy.

300
00:15:13,573 --> 00:15:16,111
Move it on back.

301
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:23,449
Oh, come on.

302
00:15:23,451 --> 00:15:26,087
Nothing you haven't seen before.

303
00:15:27,587 --> 00:15:29,687
Who is it?

304
00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:32,023
I don't know yet.
I haven't opened the door.

305
00:15:32,025 --> 00:15:33,527
Who is it?

306
00:15:36,764 --> 00:15:38,964
Hey, I got a delivery here
for Jacob Kitner.

307
00:15:38,966 --> 00:15:40,431
Yeah, I can sign for it.

308
00:15:40,433 --> 00:15:42,567
- He's not Jacob Kitner!
- I'm not.

309
00:15:42,569 --> 00:15:44,235
Are you a resident
of this house?

310
00:15:44,237 --> 00:15:46,638
- He is not a resident!
- I'm not.

311
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,440
Is there someone who can
sign for this who is?

312
00:15:48,442 --> 00:15:49,841
It ain't him!

313
00:15:49,843 --> 00:15:52,011
He's Jacob Kitner.
He can sign for it.

314
00:15:53,347 --> 00:15:55,080
I'm Jacob Kitner.

315
00:15:55,082 --> 00:15:57,715
Sign here.

316
00:15:57,717 --> 00:15:59,685
This guy, he kidnapped me.

317
00:15:59,687 --> 00:16:02,321
He broke my arm and leg.
You gotta help me.

318
00:16:02,323 --> 00:16:04,455
Did he also cast
and set your injuries?

319
00:16:04,457 --> 00:16:07,359
Yeah.
He's a doctor.

320
00:16:07,361 --> 00:16:09,427
You gotta help me.

321
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:11,129
Nothing changes, Jake.

322
00:16:11,131 --> 00:16:13,197
Who the hell are you?

323
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,867
Daniel.

324
00:16:14,869 --> 00:16:18,103
Daniel O'Connor.
We took trig together.

325
00:16:18,105 --> 00:16:20,272
See you later, asshole.

326
00:16:20,274 --> 00:16:22,206
I never took trig!

327
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,109
Hey, sorry, dude.
I didn't recognize you.

328
00:16:24,111 --> 00:16:25,577
That's cool, man.

329
00:16:25,579 --> 00:16:28,013
The hat and shorts and shit
really throw people off.

330
00:16:28,015 --> 00:16:29,348
Yeah, no doubt.

331
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,648
What are you doing here?

332
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:33,886
His dad paid me
to take care of him.

333
00:16:33,888 --> 00:16:35,687
- How much?
- A grand.

334
00:16:35,689 --> 00:16:39,090
That's not enough.
That kid's an asshole.

335
00:16:39,092 --> 00:16:40,658
Yeah, he messes around.

336
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,894
You don't get into an accident
like that for no reason.

337
00:16:42,896 --> 00:16:44,529
He's bad energy.

338
00:16:44,531 --> 00:16:46,764
Yeah.
Where's the package?

339
00:16:46,766 --> 00:16:47,932
Just a second.

340
00:16:47,934 --> 00:16:50,335
By the way, he told me
that you kidnapped him.

341
00:16:50,337 --> 00:16:52,237
I'm gonna come around back.

342
00:16:52,239 --> 00:16:53,375
All right.

343
00:16:55,443 --> 00:16:57,746
I don't remember that kid
at all.

344
00:17:04,051 --> 00:17:05,850
Somebody loves this guy.

345
00:17:05,852 --> 00:17:07,119
Yeah, then why am I here?

346
00:17:07,121 --> 00:17:11,090
Stop talking and kiss already!

347
00:17:11,092 --> 00:17:12,224
Ugh!

348
00:17:12,226 --> 00:17:14,193
All right, Sam,
see you around.

349
00:17:14,195 --> 00:17:15,530
I'll see you around.

350
00:17:18,332 --> 00:17:20,765
- Help me downstairs.
- I don't think so.

351
00:17:20,767 --> 00:17:23,234
Well, it's either that
or bring the shit up here.

352
00:17:23,236 --> 00:17:25,003
I could just as easily
do neither.

353
00:17:25,005 --> 00:17:27,005
I'm gonna throw myself down
the stairs and break my neck.

354
00:17:27,007 --> 00:17:30,678
Everyone will think you did it,
and you'll go to prison.

355
00:17:37,717 --> 00:17:40,718
What the hell am I
supposed to do with this?

356
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,589
It's from your cousin Marie.

357
00:17:43,591 --> 00:17:45,858
You used to have a thing for
Marie, didn't you?

358
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,192
I don't remember.

359
00:17:47,194 --> 00:17:49,494
Yeah, you totally
had a thing for Marie.

360
00:17:49,496 --> 00:17:50,631
Stop it.

361
00:17:51,899 --> 00:17:54,399
Oh, cool! <i>West Wing.</i>

362
00:17:54,401 --> 00:17:57,403
- Never heard of it.
- It's a pretty good show.

363
00:17:57,405 --> 00:18:00,272
Yeah, I bet. You want it?
I'll sell it to you.

364
00:18:00,274 --> 00:18:02,640
- No.
- Wholesale, at cost.

365
00:18:02,642 --> 00:18:04,709
You can't say at cost.
It cost you nothing.

366
00:18:04,711 --> 00:18:08,914
I'm not gonna give this to you for free.
That's ridiculous.

367
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,784
Going, going, gone.

368
00:18:17,457 --> 00:18:19,957
Who would send me this shit?

369
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:22,394
This is from your office.

370
00:18:22,396 --> 00:18:24,196
I know who sent it to me.

371
00:18:24,198 --> 00:18:28,434
I don't understand who'd send it
to me in the figurative way.

372
00:18:28,436 --> 00:18:31,102
Well, looking at this stuff,

373
00:18:31,104 --> 00:18:36,108
whoever sent this to you
doesn't know anything about you.

374
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:39,578
Actually,
really any of this stuff,

375
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,580
all of it
seems to be indicative

376
00:18:41,582 --> 00:18:43,615
of someone who doesn't
know you at all.

377
00:18:43,617 --> 00:18:46,885
They probably don't know you
because you don't know them.

378
00:18:46,887 --> 00:18:48,857
That's not true.

379
00:18:51,624 --> 00:18:54,259
This is from Kate,
from your office.

380
00:18:54,261 --> 00:18:56,628
What's Kate's last name?

381
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,930
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

382
00:18:58,932 --> 00:19:01,766
Been here for a few hours now,
not to mention last night.

383
00:19:01,768 --> 00:19:04,102
You'd rather jerk me around
than ask me how I've been

384
00:19:04,104 --> 00:19:05,337
or what I've been up to.

385
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:06,437
Are you kidding me?

386
00:19:06,439 --> 00:19:08,506
It's not like you asked me.

387
00:19:08,508 --> 00:19:11,042
All right, fine.
We're in the same position then.

388
00:19:11,044 --> 00:19:14,079
What have you been up to, Sam?

389
00:19:14,081 --> 00:19:15,747
- Shut up.
- No, tell me.

390
00:19:15,749 --> 00:19:19,251
I really, really,
really want to know.

391
00:19:19,253 --> 00:19:21,219
Shut up.
I'm taking you upstairs.

392
00:19:21,221 --> 00:19:22,955
Come on!

393
00:19:22,957 --> 00:19:24,322
No, no, wait, wait.

394
00:19:24,324 --> 00:19:26,157
Seriously. You know
what the difference is

395
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:30,195
between you asking me what I've
been up to since I left Jersey,

396
00:19:30,197 --> 00:19:31,597
and me asking you?

397
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:33,165
No.

398
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:36,334
There are any number of things
that I could've been doing

399
00:19:36,336 --> 00:19:38,669
because I left
my parents' house.

400
00:19:38,671 --> 00:19:40,839
I have something
interesting to say

401
00:19:40,841 --> 00:19:43,675
because I have
something to say.

402
00:19:43,677 --> 00:19:46,677
I know what the answer would be
if I asked you, you know?

403
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:49,313
You've been doing
what you've been doing

404
00:19:49,315 --> 00:19:50,882
for the last 10 years.

405
00:19:50,884 --> 00:19:53,253
You gotta see
what I'm talking about.

406
00:20:00,294 --> 00:20:04,163
Is that the shirt
Zoe Mayer threw up on?

407
00:20:04,165 --> 00:20:05,798
Yeah, of course.

408
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,000
When was the last time
you washed that?

409
00:20:08,002 --> 00:20:09,801
You wear that like every night,

410
00:20:09,803 --> 00:20:12,271
wrap it around your face and
sniff it before you go to sleep?

411
00:20:12,273 --> 00:20:14,939
All right, show's over.

412
00:20:14,941 --> 00:20:17,245
I'm taking the shirt off.

413
00:20:40,133 --> 00:20:41,602
Hello?

414
00:20:44,037 --> 00:20:45,439
Hello!

415
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,479
Hello!

416
00:21:06,493 --> 00:21:07,826
Hello?

417
00:21:08,963 --> 00:21:10,228
Hey, are you Sam?

418
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:12,697
Yeah, I am.
Who are you?

419
00:21:12,699 --> 00:21:15,000
I'm Lily.
I'm Jake's physical therapist.

420
00:21:15,002 --> 00:21:17,468
- Physical therapist?
- Yeah.

421
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,271
At some point, he's gonna
have to walk again.

422
00:21:19,273 --> 00:21:20,671
No, it's not that.

423
00:21:20,673 --> 00:21:22,907
I'm just surprised
his dad sprang for it.

424
00:21:22,909 --> 00:21:25,244
Well, it was a choice
of someone to bathe him

425
00:21:25,246 --> 00:21:26,778
or his ability
to walk straight.

426
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,880
I think they made
the smart decision.

427
00:21:28,882 --> 00:21:30,215
I don't know.

428
00:21:30,217 --> 00:21:33,017
Uh, can you tell me
where Jake is?

429
00:21:33,019 --> 00:21:34,453
Yeah, he's in the other room.

430
00:21:34,455 --> 00:21:36,120
Ah!

431
00:21:36,122 --> 00:21:38,490
Who the hell is this?

432
00:21:38,492 --> 00:21:41,392
Lily. She's your
physical therapist.

433
00:21:41,394 --> 00:21:43,861
My dad sprung for
a physical therapist?

434
00:21:43,863 --> 00:21:46,298
Well, it was a choice between
either having to bathe you or...

435
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,500
Okay, thank you, Sam.
Thank you.

436
00:21:48,502 --> 00:21:51,035
So can you stand
on your own yet?

437
00:21:51,037 --> 00:21:53,839
Maybe.
I haven't tried.

438
00:21:53,841 --> 00:21:55,577
Okay, try.

439
00:21:58,946 --> 00:22:01,413
Can I at least get a cup of
coffee or something first?

440
00:22:01,415 --> 00:22:03,881
Uh, nope.
Try.

441
00:22:03,883 --> 00:22:06,286
Okay.

442
00:22:10,189 --> 00:22:13,193
- Get a little help there?
- Mm-hmm.

443
00:22:16,196 --> 00:22:19,097
You live around here?

444
00:22:19,099 --> 00:22:20,601
Can you lift up
your left arm, please?

445
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,403
Your injured arm.

446
00:22:24,405 --> 00:22:26,471
- Oh, my left arm.
- Yeah.

447
00:22:26,473 --> 00:22:28,874
- That was the confusion.
- Yeah.

448
00:22:28,876 --> 00:22:30,309
You got a boyfriend?

449
00:22:30,311 --> 00:22:31,510
No.
No patience either.

450
00:22:31,512 --> 00:22:33,011
And those two things
go hand-in-hand.

451
00:22:33,013 --> 00:22:35,613
Whoa!
This kitten's got claws.

452
00:22:35,615 --> 00:22:37,683
You're gonna walk like a peg leg
for the rest of your life

453
00:22:37,685 --> 00:22:39,350
if you don't let me help you.

454
00:22:39,352 --> 00:22:40,886
In order for me to help you,
you need to not talk

455
00:22:40,888 --> 00:22:43,522
while I'm giving you
directions, okay?

456
00:22:43,524 --> 00:22:45,624
Okay, so try lifting
your arm again.

457
00:22:45,626 --> 00:22:47,662
This time keep the tension
in the shoulder.

458
00:22:53,266 --> 00:22:55,266
Good. See?

459
00:22:55,268 --> 00:22:57,703
The world's a lot quieter
when you listen.

460
00:22:57,705 --> 00:23:00,571
- Sam.
- You need me to walk you out?

461
00:23:00,573 --> 00:23:02,307
No. Okay, here's the deal.

462
00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:04,309
I need you to get up
every morning at 9 a.m.

463
00:23:04,311 --> 00:23:06,645
I need him up early,
moving his arms and legs.

464
00:23:06,647 --> 00:23:08,981
If he doesn't do this,
he could get major blood clots,

465
00:23:08,983 --> 00:23:10,815
and he could die, okay?

466
00:23:10,817 --> 00:23:12,884
I need you to shower him
once a day.

467
00:23:12,886 --> 00:23:15,587
I need you to change
his dressings twice a day.

468
00:23:15,589 --> 00:23:18,357
And keep him off heavy dairy,
and keep him eating protein.

469
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:19,858
- All right?
- Okay.

470
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,392
Okay, I'll be back
once a week.

471
00:23:21,394 --> 00:23:23,797
Do you need me to walk you out?

472
00:23:25,865 --> 00:23:27,866
- She's awesome.
- She's tough is what she is.

473
00:23:27,868 --> 00:23:29,600
I don't need that
in my life right now.

474
00:23:29,602 --> 00:23:31,469
Yeah, the last thing you need
is someone pushing you

475
00:23:31,471 --> 00:23:33,472
into some sort of recovery.

476
00:23:33,474 --> 00:23:36,742
She's got a whole regimen
I gotta do with you.

477
00:23:36,744 --> 00:23:38,109
Sounds awful.

478
00:23:38,111 --> 00:23:40,111
Yeah, for me more than you.

479
00:23:40,113 --> 00:23:42,580
Why are you doing this anyway?

480
00:23:42,582 --> 00:23:45,484
My dad gonna give you
his Buick or something?

481
00:23:45,486 --> 00:23:47,619
I'm your friend.
You know who I saw

482
00:23:47,621 --> 00:23:50,022
taking out the garbage
across the street last night?

483
00:23:50,024 --> 00:23:51,490
No.

484
00:23:51,492 --> 00:23:52,690
Zoe.

485
00:23:52,692 --> 00:23:54,760
Are you sure
you weren't hallucinating?

486
00:23:54,762 --> 00:23:55,894
Positive.

487
00:23:55,896 --> 00:23:57,128
You sure?
Because your room smells like

488
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,530
the University of Vermont.

489
00:23:58,532 --> 00:24:00,098
Could've been a pot high.

490
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,434
I wasn't.
It was her.

491
00:24:02,436 --> 00:24:06,538
Well, we all know who reigned
victorious in that case.

492
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,742
Right?

493
00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:11,109
Who potted that plant?

494
00:24:11,111 --> 00:24:12,176
Okay, Jake.

495
00:24:12,178 --> 00:24:13,344
Who mined that field, baby?

496
00:24:13,346 --> 00:24:14,745
You win.
You're the man.

497
00:24:14,747 --> 00:24:16,715
And who's shirt
did she throw up on?

498
00:24:16,717 --> 00:24:20,418
Yeah, that was funny
10 years ago. Thanks.

499
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,654
- <i>Hey, Sam!</i>
- What?

500
00:24:22,656 --> 00:24:24,321
<i>I need you to look
through the basement</i>

501
00:24:24,323 --> 00:24:25,890
<i>and get some of my old stuff.</i>

502
00:24:25,892 --> 00:24:28,193
<i>I can't keep wearing
the same two shirts every day.</i>

503
00:24:28,195 --> 00:24:31,295
I don't think you're gonna want
any of this shit down here.

504
00:24:31,297 --> 00:24:35,266
<i>Don't make that decision for me.</i>

505
00:24:35,268 --> 00:24:38,102
<i>Take a little longer.</i>

506
00:24:38,104 --> 00:24:40,805
<i>Are you masturbating?</i>

507
00:24:40,807 --> 00:24:42,607
<i>Did you hang yourself?</i>

508
00:24:42,609 --> 00:24:44,842
<i>You hung yourself while
masturbating, didn't you?</i>

509
00:24:44,844 --> 00:24:48,647
Oh, you are not gonna believe
what I just found.

510
00:24:48,649 --> 00:24:49,714
Does your guy have glasses?

511
00:24:49,716 --> 00:24:51,515
I'll answer gender-neutrally

512
00:24:51,517 --> 00:24:53,318
that my person
does not wear glasses.

513
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,119
- Stop trying to cheat.
- It's not cheating.

514
00:24:55,121 --> 00:24:56,353
It's strategy.

515
00:24:56,355 --> 00:24:58,055
Does your person
have brown hair?

516
00:24:58,057 --> 00:25:00,724
No. Does your girl
have brown hair?

517
00:25:00,726 --> 00:25:04,061
My person does not have
brown hair.

518
00:25:04,063 --> 00:25:06,263
This used to be a lot more fun
when I could cheat your ass out

519
00:25:06,265 --> 00:25:07,432
in two moves.

520
00:25:07,434 --> 00:25:09,734
I know.
It must suck.

521
00:25:09,736 --> 00:25:12,637
Yeah. When's my dad coming back?

522
00:25:12,639 --> 00:25:14,004
Three weeks.

523
00:25:14,006 --> 00:25:17,109
I asked Lily if I could
be out of here before then.

524
00:25:17,111 --> 00:25:19,677
She said maybe.

525
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,013
Does your person have
wrinkles on their face? Why?

526
00:25:22,015 --> 00:25:25,117
No. She wants me to get
up and walk around first.

527
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:27,017
Does your guy have brown eyes?

528
00:25:27,019 --> 00:25:28,887
Yeah.

529
00:25:28,889 --> 00:25:31,689
Oh.
Damn it!

530
00:25:31,691 --> 00:25:33,692
Why do you want to leave
before your dad comes back?

531
00:25:33,694 --> 00:25:35,827
I barely wanted to be here
for the wedding.

532
00:25:35,829 --> 00:25:38,730
I'm all set
with seeing my father.

533
00:25:38,732 --> 00:25:41,233
Is your person
Wendell McAdams?

534
00:25:41,235 --> 00:25:42,837
Yes.

535
00:25:44,204 --> 00:25:46,003
I win.

536
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,045
Yeah, hey, Mom.

537
00:25:55,047 --> 00:25:57,081
Yeah, I'm fine.

538
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:58,817
It's okay.

539
00:25:58,819 --> 00:26:01,355
I feel like I'm back
in fucking high school again.

540
00:26:03,857 --> 00:26:06,558
Yeah, Mom, he's moving around
a lot better than before.

541
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,093
He was supposed to out of
the wheelchair this week.

542
00:26:09,095 --> 00:26:10,762
I guess he's just not ready.

543
00:26:10,764 --> 00:26:14,465
No, Mom, you can't afford
to give me money, okay?

544
00:26:14,467 --> 00:26:16,667
The plan is to make
the food money last,

545
00:26:16,669 --> 00:26:18,936
and then I'm gonna give you
whatever's left over.

546
00:26:18,938 --> 00:26:21,907
Yeah, Mom, it's just
a lot of bullshit,

547
00:26:21,909 --> 00:26:23,841
like he can't t even make it
through physical therapy

548
00:26:23,843 --> 00:26:26,711
without saying something
disgusting to his therapist.

549
00:26:26,713 --> 00:26:29,781
You know how easily we can
turn this into a sex swing?

550
00:26:29,783 --> 00:26:31,782
Nah, it's not that bad.
It's a lot of sitting around.

551
00:26:31,784 --> 00:26:34,654
I mean, the guy's on Vicodin
almost all the time.

552
00:26:35,988 --> 00:26:37,188
Whoa! Shit my pants!

553
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:39,693
Shit my pants,
shit my pants.

554
00:26:42,196 --> 00:26:43,828
No, I can't leave him alone.

555
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:46,497
He might break his neck
or something.

556
00:26:46,499 --> 00:26:49,033
Mom, Mom, I gotta go.

557
00:26:49,035 --> 00:26:51,936
That was the doorbell.
Jake might have woken up, too.

558
00:26:51,938 --> 00:26:53,774
All right, bye.

559
00:27:00,581 --> 00:27:03,982
Oh, shit.
Do I have the wrong house?

560
00:27:03,984 --> 00:27:07,185
I don't know.
Who are you looking for?

561
00:27:07,187 --> 00:27:08,587
Jake Kitner.

562
00:27:08,589 --> 00:27:11,388
Yeah, he's upstairs.

563
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:14,259
Might still be sleeping,
though.

564
00:27:14,261 --> 00:27:16,293
It's 10 a.m.

565
00:27:16,295 --> 00:27:18,230
Yeah, you think with
all those broken bones,

566
00:27:18,232 --> 00:27:19,430
he'd get his ass up.

567
00:27:19,432 --> 00:27:21,832
Um, can you wake him up for me?

568
00:27:21,834 --> 00:27:23,267
I'm his girlfriend.

569
00:27:23,269 --> 00:27:26,473
Who'd have thunk it?
He hasn't mentioned you once.

570
00:27:28,976 --> 00:27:31,212
- What?
- Julie's here.

571
00:27:33,479 --> 00:27:35,280
- Give us some privacy.
- No.

572
00:27:35,282 --> 00:27:37,849
I'm gonna sit in the corner and
keep record of everything said.

573
00:27:37,851 --> 00:27:40,784
No, seriously, go outside
and take a walk or something.

574
00:27:40,786 --> 00:27:42,286
Why?

575
00:27:42,288 --> 00:27:44,054
I can hear almost everything
in this house.

576
00:27:44,056 --> 00:27:46,524
No, you can't.

577
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:49,197
I can hear you cry yourself
to sleep every night.

578
00:27:59,672 --> 00:28:02,607
You can go upstairs.
He's awake.

579
00:28:02,609 --> 00:28:05,176
- He's not coming down?
- Nope.

580
00:28:05,178 --> 00:28:08,683
Why don't you go upstairs and
give him a hard time about it?

581
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,990
Who's there?

582
00:28:18,992 --> 00:28:21,859
Jake, baby, it's me.

583
00:28:21,861 --> 00:28:22,994
Julie?

584
00:28:22,996 --> 00:28:25,996
Jesus, you're a mess.

585
00:28:31,971 --> 00:28:33,707
Hey.

586
00:28:36,743 --> 00:28:38,275
What's going on?

587
00:28:38,277 --> 00:28:40,078
Hey, what's up?
I'm Jeremy.

588
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,680
Hey, Jeremy.
Want a hit?

589
00:28:42,682 --> 00:28:45,550
Uh, no, no.

590
00:28:45,552 --> 00:28:48,086
You, uh, you friends with Julie?

591
00:28:48,088 --> 00:28:51,990
Yeah, yeah.
I'm just along for the ride.

592
00:28:51,992 --> 00:28:53,692
Boyfriend.

593
00:28:53,694 --> 00:28:57,728
Yeah, she's up there
talking to Jake.

594
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:00,031
That a Cathode Corner
Nixie watch?

595
00:29:00,033 --> 00:29:03,734
Yes!
You know about these?

596
00:29:03,736 --> 00:29:06,471
- I know everything about those.
- Oh, my God.

597
00:29:06,473 --> 00:29:08,106
- Sam, right?
- Yeah.

598
00:29:08,108 --> 00:29:09,907
- Jeremy.
- Yeah.

599
00:29:09,909 --> 00:29:13,410
What took you so long
to get here?

600
00:29:13,412 --> 00:29:19,283
I've been a little busy.

601
00:29:19,285 --> 00:29:20,952
I almost died.

602
00:29:20,954 --> 00:29:22,387
And you didn't.

603
00:29:22,389 --> 00:29:24,988
That's the most important thing.

604
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,690
And I shouldn't look bad

605
00:29:26,692 --> 00:29:29,793
because it's not like you
weren't gonna get better.

606
00:29:29,795 --> 00:29:31,428
What?

607
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:36,501
This just couldn't have
come at a worse time.

608
00:29:36,503 --> 00:29:38,168
For who?

609
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:41,638
For me, for us.

610
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:47,745
When would have been a better
time for this to happen for you?

611
00:29:47,747 --> 00:29:50,348
Jake's been here for almost
a whole week though,

612
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:52,216
and she was supposed to come
on like day two or something.

613
00:29:52,218 --> 00:29:53,618
She's been busy.
I mean, I've been busy.

614
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:56,454
I know, but she should
really be there for him.

615
00:29:56,456 --> 00:29:58,956
She's here now.
I mean, she's a good friend.

616
00:29:58,958 --> 00:30:00,358
No, no doubt.

617
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,494
I mean, I wouldn't
drag you to Jersey.

618
00:30:03,496 --> 00:30:06,296
But I guess otherwise
she's pretty cool.

619
00:30:06,298 --> 00:30:09,533
Jake's just always had
garbage taste in women.

620
00:30:09,535 --> 00:30:11,202
No, "taste" is
the wrong way to say it.

621
00:30:11,204 --> 00:30:13,937
It implies some sort of
discerning view.

622
00:30:13,939 --> 00:30:17,975
He'll go for anything
with a vague interest.

623
00:30:17,977 --> 00:30:21,478
I guess shitty women just flock to him.
I don't know.

624
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,048
Yeah, that's the right way
to put it.

625
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:27,819
Okay, I'm just gonna need you to
be a little more understanding.

626
00:30:27,821 --> 00:30:31,688
I'm just gonna need you to
meet me halfway here, Jake.

627
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:34,125
I'm sorry.

628
00:30:34,127 --> 00:30:37,128
- Really?
- I've been alone all week.

629
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:39,397
There's nothing familiar
around me.

630
00:30:39,399 --> 00:30:43,033
I just feel kicked around,
you know?

631
00:30:43,035 --> 00:30:45,403
- But this is my fault.
- What?

632
00:30:45,405 --> 00:30:50,707
You were on the phone with me,
and you crashed.

633
00:30:50,709 --> 00:30:55,146
It's your subconscious saying
that we shouldn't be together.

634
00:30:55,148 --> 00:30:58,017
Julie, I want to be with you now
more than ever.

635
00:31:00,152 --> 00:31:02,456
I have to go to the bathroom.

636
00:31:03,756 --> 00:31:06,025
Second door on your left.

637
00:31:09,896 --> 00:31:11,763
Oh, shit. Get out of the car,
get out of the car.

638
00:31:16,035 --> 00:31:18,205
Hey, baby, how you doing?

639
00:31:19,505 --> 00:31:22,676
Bye, Jeremy!
Bye, Julie!

640
00:31:28,582 --> 00:31:30,814
Hey, do me a favor
and check on Julie.

641
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,949
She went to the bathroom.

642
00:31:31,951 --> 00:31:33,751
She left.

643
00:31:33,753 --> 00:31:35,419
She did?

644
00:31:35,421 --> 00:31:37,288
Yeah, with her new boyfriend.

645
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:40,724
I didn't know
it was her new guy,

646
00:31:40,726 --> 00:31:42,329
not until they left.

647
00:31:45,465 --> 00:31:48,366
I think I wanna go outside,

648
00:31:48,368 --> 00:31:51,472
go for a walk or something.

649
00:31:52,538 --> 00:31:54,571
For a walk?

650
00:32:05,351 --> 00:32:07,551
What goes around, rolls around.

651
00:32:07,553 --> 00:32:10,053
That was... That was
really something, Marky.

652
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:12,090
- What's up, Sam?
- Nothing much.

653
00:32:12,092 --> 00:32:14,458
You gonna take out the garbage?

654
00:32:15,861 --> 00:32:18,897
Hey, Marky, you're gonna die
cleaning a booth.

655
00:32:18,899 --> 00:32:21,032
You know who's gonna be there
to find the body?

656
00:32:21,034 --> 00:32:22,166
Who?

657
00:32:22,168 --> 00:32:24,836
No one.
You're gonna die alone.

658
00:32:26,206 --> 00:32:28,205
Real funny, Jake.

659
00:32:28,207 --> 00:32:29,974
Heed my warnings, Marky.

660
00:32:29,976 --> 00:32:32,045
Heed them.

661
00:32:34,046 --> 00:32:35,346
I'm gonna get a milkshake.

662
00:32:35,348 --> 00:32:37,282
Lily said stay away
from heavy dairy.

663
00:32:37,284 --> 00:32:39,016
One milkshake's
not gonna kill me.

664
00:32:39,018 --> 00:32:41,218
Jacob Shitner.

665
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,588
Sara Michaels.

666
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,188
I could punch you in the face
right now,

667
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:47,125
and no one would say
I was out of line.

668
00:32:47,127 --> 00:32:48,292
How's that?

669
00:32:48,294 --> 00:32:49,860
Hey, Sam. How are you?

670
00:32:49,862 --> 00:32:51,361
Been better, been worse.

671
00:32:51,363 --> 00:32:52,664
Why could you punch him?

672
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:54,965
Uh, let's see.
I was gonna go to L.A.

673
00:32:54,967 --> 00:32:56,935
take a vacation,
see some friends,

674
00:32:56,937 --> 00:32:59,070
maybe see
our friend Jake here.

675
00:32:59,072 --> 00:33:00,737
He said,
"Come on by, stay with me.

676
00:33:00,739 --> 00:33:03,174
We'll have a different dinner
every night of the week."

677
00:33:03,176 --> 00:33:04,876
Which was very nice of me
to offer, by the way.

678
00:33:04,878 --> 00:33:07,579
Yes, and exceedingly nice of me
to take him up on it.

679
00:33:07,581 --> 00:33:08,780
What happened?

680
00:33:08,782 --> 00:33:10,747
Well, I clear my schedule,

681
00:33:10,749 --> 00:33:12,684
tell all my friends my dates,

682
00:33:12,686 --> 00:33:14,185
and then I get to LAX,

683
00:33:14,187 --> 00:33:18,188
and his phone goes
to voicemail all week.

684
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,724
I apologized.
Profusely.

685
00:33:19,726 --> 00:33:22,260
Yes, he did.
He apologized up and down,

686
00:33:22,262 --> 00:33:24,762
and he finally invited me
to a very nice lunch date

687
00:33:24,764 --> 00:33:28,002
two hours before
I was going to leave L.A.

688
00:33:30,903 --> 00:33:32,637
The apology still counts.

689
00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:34,539
In some cultures, maybe.

690
00:33:34,541 --> 00:33:36,174
Did you have a good time,
otherwise?

691
00:33:36,176 --> 00:33:38,810
Yes, of course.
See, if I've learned one thing

692
00:33:38,812 --> 00:33:41,946
from being in close proximity
to Jake in high school,

693
00:33:41,948 --> 00:33:43,348
it's to have a backup plan

694
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:46,016
because that is usually
more reliable.

695
00:33:46,018 --> 00:33:47,651
Yeah, that's a good one.

696
00:33:47,653 --> 00:33:50,189
Well, I'll let you two
peruse the menu.

697
00:33:51,457 --> 00:33:53,127
I'd like a milkshake.

698
00:33:54,393 --> 00:33:56,694
- She's sharp.
- She got fat.

699
00:33:56,696 --> 00:33:58,629
- What?
- She got fat.

700
00:33:58,631 --> 00:34:00,898
Maybe she's just bloated
or something.

701
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,199
You're nuts.

702
00:34:02,201 --> 00:34:04,369
I'm just telling you
how I see it.

703
00:34:04,371 --> 00:34:05,836
You know that thing
about anorexic girls

704
00:34:05,838 --> 00:34:07,972
where they can't tell
just how skinny they are?

705
00:34:07,974 --> 00:34:09,941
Yeah, let me guess.
I have that problem with women.

706
00:34:09,943 --> 00:34:14,345
No. You're the asshole
that causes that shit to happen.

707
00:34:14,347 --> 00:34:17,215
I'm definitely not the first
person to think that way.

708
00:34:17,217 --> 00:34:20,617
Sara's nice and smart,
so please tell me.

709
00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:22,220
Why did you treat her
like crap?

710
00:34:22,222 --> 00:34:24,856
I didn't treat her
like crap, okay?

711
00:34:24,858 --> 00:34:26,858
And besides, who comes up
to a table like that

712
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,593
and just tells a nasty story?
Who does that?

713
00:34:29,595 --> 00:34:31,129
Sounded like
she was pretty upset.

714
00:34:31,131 --> 00:34:32,329
What does she have
to upset about?

715
00:34:32,331 --> 00:34:33,865
She said she had a good time.

716
00:34:33,867 --> 00:34:35,436
You could say you're sorry.

717
00:35:00,593 --> 00:35:01,725
I think I just saw Zoe.

718
00:35:01,727 --> 00:35:03,928
She was taking out the garbage.

719
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:05,062
Yeah, right.

720
00:35:05,064 --> 00:35:06,229
I swear.

721
00:35:06,231 --> 00:35:07,865
You're wrong.

722
00:35:07,867 --> 00:35:09,669
I saw what I saw.

723
00:35:11,003 --> 00:35:12,637
Hey, Sling Blade.

724
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:14,541
Come here.

725
00:35:16,242 --> 00:35:18,008
Does Zoe Mayer work here?

726
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:19,977
Yeah.
She works in the kitchen.

727
00:35:19,979 --> 00:35:21,211
Are you serious?

728
00:35:21,213 --> 00:35:22,780
Totally.
She's great.

729
00:35:22,782 --> 00:35:24,749
Most chicks, they don't like
taking out garbage

730
00:35:24,751 --> 00:35:26,517
and cleaning dishes and shit.

731
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:30,787
You know how many used tampons
we find on old plates of food?

732
00:35:30,789 --> 00:35:32,356
Why does she work here?

733
00:35:32,358 --> 00:35:34,225
She lost her job
and her dad died.

734
00:35:34,227 --> 00:35:35,325
Whole bunch of shit.

735
00:35:35,327 --> 00:35:36,961
She moved home
a few weeks ago.

736
00:35:36,963 --> 00:35:38,963
Tough shit, this economy.

737
00:35:38,965 --> 00:35:41,432
Wonderful platitude, Marky.

738
00:35:41,434 --> 00:35:43,336
Ehh.

739
00:35:45,572 --> 00:35:49,673
Hey, you should go
talk to her, dummy.

740
00:35:49,675 --> 00:35:51,309
Seriously.

741
00:35:51,311 --> 00:35:54,312
March in there,
rip her bloody apron off,

742
00:35:54,314 --> 00:35:57,251
and burn her ass
on the deep fryer.

743
00:36:02,789 --> 00:36:04,187
Why do you live in New Jersey?

744
00:36:04,189 --> 00:36:05,856
Why can't you raise
your arm any higher?

745
00:36:05,858 --> 00:36:08,126
No, seriously, I think you'd
make more money elsewhere.

746
00:36:08,128 --> 00:36:10,394
My partner lives here.

747
00:36:10,396 --> 00:36:11,963
Yeah, but you shouldn't be
unhappy for someone else.

748
00:36:11,965 --> 00:36:13,430
I live in L.A. and...

749
00:36:13,432 --> 00:36:16,233
Jake, you live in a dream world.
Come on. Arm higher.

750
00:36:16,235 --> 00:36:17,568
- I can't.
- Try harder.

751
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:20,437
I know you can try harder
than this.

752
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:22,740
I'm gonna break my own shoulder,
let it set for two days

753
00:36:22,742 --> 00:36:25,075
and show you that you can
raise your arm higher than this.

754
00:36:25,077 --> 00:36:27,644
That'd be silly.

755
00:36:27,646 --> 00:36:28,915
Come on.

756
00:36:29,916 --> 00:36:31,582
Good. Good!

757
00:36:31,584 --> 00:36:33,383
- You want some water?
- Yeah.

758
00:36:33,385 --> 00:36:34,554
Okay.

759
00:36:39,892 --> 00:36:41,028
Good.

760
00:36:42,729 --> 00:36:45,428
- You know, you're very lucky.
- How's that?

761
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:47,365
Do you know how hard it is to
get someone to help you move?

762
00:36:47,367 --> 00:36:49,767
You got someone here with you
for a over month,

763
00:36:49,769 --> 00:36:51,434
taking care of you.

764
00:36:51,436 --> 00:36:52,672
That's friendship.

765
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,773
I guess.

766
00:36:55,775 --> 00:36:57,809
Tell me what it is then.

767
00:36:57,811 --> 00:36:59,343
I don't know.

768
00:36:59,345 --> 00:37:03,648
Well, despite your best efforts,
that kid's your friend.

769
00:37:11,256 --> 00:37:13,390
<i>Thank you very much. Thank
you, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

770
00:37:13,392 --> 00:37:15,693
<i>Welcome once again
to "Beat the Clock."</i>

771
00:37:15,695 --> 00:37:16,961
What are we doing tonight?

772
00:37:16,963 --> 00:37:18,662
I don't know.

773
00:37:18,664 --> 00:37:22,867
I'm gonna go upstairs
and maybe finish this book.

774
00:37:22,869 --> 00:37:25,570
Or maybe blow my brains out
after you fall asleep.

775
00:37:25,572 --> 00:37:27,640
Why didn't you ever
go on <i>Jeopardy!?</i>

776
00:37:29,108 --> 00:37:30,975
Why would I go on <i>Jeopardy!?</i>

777
00:37:30,977 --> 00:37:32,242
You aced the SATs.

778
00:37:32,244 --> 00:37:34,010
The SATs aren't like
Trivial Pursuit.

779
00:37:34,012 --> 00:37:35,646
Did you take the SATs?

780
00:37:35,648 --> 00:37:38,115
Yeah, and I finished college,
which puts me one up on you.

781
00:37:38,117 --> 00:37:40,885
It doesn't just have to be
<i>Jeopardy!</i> It could be any show.

782
00:37:40,887 --> 00:37:42,320
Any question show.

783
00:37:42,322 --> 00:37:43,820
<i>Who's Smarter
Than A Fifth Grader?</i>

784
00:37:43,822 --> 00:37:45,289
I bet you're at least that.

785
00:37:45,291 --> 00:37:48,291
We can make a lot of money,
Sam, seriously.

786
00:37:48,293 --> 00:37:50,126
I'll represent you.

787
00:37:50,128 --> 00:37:53,164
I'll be your agent.
And you know what?

788
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:54,966
If you act retarded
in real life,

789
00:37:54,968 --> 00:37:57,367
it'll be even more surprising
when you win.

790
00:37:57,369 --> 00:37:59,637
We'll make even more money.
Whole roadshow.

791
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:01,204
You see what you're doing
right now?

792
00:38:01,206 --> 00:38:03,207
- What am I doing?
- You're trying...

793
00:38:03,209 --> 00:38:05,008
or at least
I think you're trying...

794
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:06,676
to help me out,

795
00:38:06,678 --> 00:38:10,814
but you just end up being
an asshole and belittling me.

796
00:38:10,816 --> 00:38:12,249
I am not.

797
00:38:12,251 --> 00:38:13,783
That's exactly
what you're doing,

798
00:38:13,785 --> 00:38:15,119
and you do it all the time.

799
00:38:15,121 --> 00:38:17,088
I don't know that that's true.

800
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:20,457
I think you're happier

801
00:38:20,459 --> 00:38:22,727
with people in your life
being bullet points.

802
00:38:22,729 --> 00:38:27,298
You know line items about me,
but nothing more.

803
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,733
And none of it applies

804
00:38:28,735 --> 00:38:31,468
to the last six or seven years
of my life.

805
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:33,506
Not true at all.

806
00:38:39,479 --> 00:38:40,811
Okay.

807
00:38:40,813 --> 00:38:42,379
Am I virgin?

808
00:38:42,381 --> 00:38:44,215
- Totally.
- I'm not.

809
00:38:44,217 --> 00:38:46,350
- You carry yourself like one.
- Well, I'm not.

810
00:38:46,352 --> 00:38:48,119
So you had sex
with a prostitute.

811
00:38:48,121 --> 00:38:51,354
I dated a girl
for three years, Jake.

812
00:38:51,356 --> 00:38:53,323
So you dated a prostitute
for three years.

813
00:38:53,325 --> 00:38:54,892
She wasn't a prostitute.

814
00:38:54,894 --> 00:38:55,992
- Stripper?
- No.

815
00:38:55,994 --> 00:38:57,327
- Sexually abused?
- No.

816
00:38:57,329 --> 00:38:59,062
- Down on her luck?
- She was a normal girl.

817
00:38:59,064 --> 00:39:00,631
She was in our class.

818
00:39:00,633 --> 00:39:01,564
Bullshit.

819
00:39:01,566 --> 00:39:03,533
Lisa Martinez.

820
00:39:03,535 --> 00:39:05,338
Oh! Bullshit.

821
00:39:06,506 --> 00:39:08,738
Three years,
you piece of shit.

822
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,474
Yeah? What happened?

823
00:39:10,476 --> 00:39:13,412
She wasn't very nice to me.

824
00:39:14,646 --> 00:39:16,881
I don't know what
to say to you right now.

825
00:39:16,883 --> 00:39:18,249
Why?

826
00:39:18,251 --> 00:39:20,318
She wasn't nice to you?

827
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,653
She was manipulative
and a liar

828
00:39:23,655 --> 00:39:28,158
and played games
and was just really uncaring.

829
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,195
That sucks.

830
00:39:31,197 --> 00:39:33,229
That's where you gotta
hit her back, man.

831
00:39:33,231 --> 00:39:35,198
Establish some fuckin' power.

832
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,269
Or just be in a relationship
where those games don't happen.

833
00:39:38,271 --> 00:39:40,838
Doesn't exist.
Gotta understand that, you know?

834
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,573
Can't let one bad egg
ruin the pantry.

835
00:39:43,575 --> 00:39:46,213
You gotta get your heart broken again.
Get out there.

836
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,146
What are you looking at,
Jimmy Stewart?

837
00:39:50,148 --> 00:39:54,320
Nothing. I think I see
Zoe walking her dog.

838
00:40:01,927 --> 00:40:03,426
- Sam?
- Zoe.

839
00:40:03,428 --> 00:40:06,463
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God.

840
00:40:06,465 --> 00:40:08,332
I didn't know you lived
in Jersey.

841
00:40:08,334 --> 00:40:10,501
Yeah.
Never left.

842
00:40:10,503 --> 00:40:11,568
Really?

843
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:13,937
Yeah.
I mean, I did for a second.

844
00:40:13,939 --> 00:40:16,307
About 20 minutes out of town.

845
00:40:16,309 --> 00:40:18,341
- Wow.
- Yeah.

846
00:40:18,343 --> 00:40:22,312
I don't have a license,
so it's tough.

847
00:40:22,314 --> 00:40:25,548
Um, are you
taking care of Jake?

848
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,649
Yeah.

849
00:40:26,651 --> 00:40:28,251
Why?

850
00:40:28,253 --> 00:40:30,086
His dad asked me to.

851
00:40:30,088 --> 00:40:33,289
It should take a lot more
than his dad asking you to.

852
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:37,294
Hey, Harold.

853
00:40:37,296 --> 00:40:39,396
What's shaking?

854
00:40:39,398 --> 00:40:41,798
- You remember his name?
- Of course.

855
00:40:44,936 --> 00:40:47,437
You want some company?

856
00:40:47,439 --> 00:40:48,738
Sure.

857
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,508
Cool.

858
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:54,412
You see anybody
from high school?

859
00:40:54,414 --> 00:40:57,847
Once in a while,
around town.

860
00:40:57,849 --> 00:40:59,582
You?

861
00:40:59,584 --> 00:41:01,651
The ones who live
in the city, sure,

862
00:41:01,653 --> 00:41:03,521
but not that much.

863
00:41:03,523 --> 00:41:06,490
High school wasn't
the best time for me.

864
00:41:06,492 --> 00:41:09,292
Yeah, anybody could have
told you that.

865
00:41:09,294 --> 00:41:12,296
Jake's a pretty shitty guy.

866
00:41:12,298 --> 00:41:14,131
Especially to you.

867
00:41:14,133 --> 00:41:16,533
I guess.

868
00:41:16,535 --> 00:41:20,171
Anyway, I grew up
across the street from him.

869
00:41:20,173 --> 00:41:22,372
You know what he did
on my tenth birthday?

870
00:41:22,374 --> 00:41:23,640
No.

871
00:41:23,642 --> 00:41:24,774
He gave me a card.

872
00:41:24,776 --> 00:41:30,013
It said, "Happy Birthday.
I hate you."

873
00:41:30,015 --> 00:41:32,283
Ohh! That sucks!

874
00:41:32,285 --> 00:41:33,751
I know! It sucks huge.

875
00:41:33,753 --> 00:41:36,486
I was ten. I didn't know
what a sociopath he was.

876
00:41:36,488 --> 00:41:39,523
I thought
he actually hated me.

877
00:41:39,525 --> 00:41:44,160
I remember that knocked me out.
Ten years old.

878
00:41:44,162 --> 00:41:47,430
Yeah, that's pretty bad.
I'm sorry he did that to you.

879
00:41:47,432 --> 00:41:51,103
It was a long time ago.
Feels pretty small now.

880
00:41:53,905 --> 00:41:57,675
How'd it go?
You fingerblast her brains out?

881
00:41:57,677 --> 00:42:01,211
No. It was fine.
We just caught up.

882
00:42:01,213 --> 00:42:02,912
I catch up with my cousins.

883
00:42:02,914 --> 00:42:06,015
- Are you gonna see her again?
- I don't know.

884
00:42:06,017 --> 00:42:08,051
Did you ask her?

885
00:42:08,053 --> 00:42:10,120
I didn't.
I live here, Jake.

886
00:42:10,122 --> 00:42:12,122
I got all the time
in the world.

887
00:42:12,124 --> 00:42:13,591
What?!

888
00:42:13,593 --> 00:42:15,459
You know what?

889
00:42:15,461 --> 00:42:18,329
I like her just as much I did
when we were in high school.

890
00:42:18,331 --> 00:42:21,398
It was easy talking to her.

891
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,267
And in a week and a half,

892
00:42:23,269 --> 00:42:25,035
you're gonna be on a plane
back to L.A.,

893
00:42:25,037 --> 00:42:27,370
and I can do
whatever I want, right?

894
00:42:27,372 --> 00:42:29,240
You're not gonna do anything.

895
00:42:29,242 --> 00:42:30,374
That's not true.

896
00:42:30,376 --> 00:42:31,675
This is a perfect time.

897
00:42:31,677 --> 00:42:34,111
She's vulnerable, she's hurt.

898
00:42:34,113 --> 00:42:36,312
Am I right?

899
00:42:36,314 --> 00:42:38,349
She's in a bad way, sure.

900
00:42:38,351 --> 00:42:40,416
So manipulate that shit.

901
00:42:40,418 --> 00:42:43,287
If it's because I've already
plowed that pasture,

902
00:42:43,289 --> 00:42:45,890
I give you my permission.

903
00:42:45,892 --> 00:42:50,461
My loose, flaccid permission.

904
00:42:50,463 --> 00:42:52,332
Thank you.

905
00:43:01,506 --> 00:43:02,842
Sam!

906
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:05,776
Hey, Jake, what's up?

907
00:43:05,778 --> 00:43:08,211
I'm hungry.

908
00:43:08,213 --> 00:43:12,115
And I smell like shit.
What are you doing?

909
00:43:12,117 --> 00:43:13,584
Zoe was walking Harold.
I was up...

910
00:43:13,586 --> 00:43:16,120
Waiting for Zoe to walk Harold.
Yeah, I know.

911
00:43:16,122 --> 00:43:18,088
What the hell, Jake?

912
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:19,990
She's gonna find out
you're a creep at some point.

913
00:43:19,992 --> 00:43:24,662
For once, please try
to keep things to a low boil.

914
00:43:24,664 --> 00:43:27,330
What the fuck
does that even mean?

915
00:43:27,332 --> 00:43:31,338
I'll feed you in 20 minutes.
I promise.

916
00:43:38,644 --> 00:43:39,642
Hello?

917
00:43:39,644 --> 00:43:41,579
<i>Jake! Boyo!</i>

918
00:43:41,581 --> 00:43:42,912
Hey, Dad.

919
00:43:42,914 --> 00:43:45,448
<i>Boyo, how do you feel?</i>

920
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:48,718
Okay.
I'm getting better, I think.

921
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,988
<i>Can I get a little refill
on this one, please?</i>

922
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:52,789
<i>Great!</i>

923
00:43:52,791 --> 00:43:54,457
How's the honeymoon?

924
00:43:54,459 --> 00:43:56,593
<i>Fantastic. Couldn't have
come at a better time.</i>

925
00:43:56,595 --> 00:43:59,796
- That's great.
- <i>Listen, is Sam around?</i>

926
00:43:59,798 --> 00:44:02,399
- He's in the shower.
- <i>Oh, uh...</i>

927
00:44:02,401 --> 00:44:04,734
<i>Can you let him know...
Listen, I fudged the dates.</i>

928
00:44:04,736 --> 00:44:08,037
<i>Yeah, we were gonna be back
two days later than I told him.</i>

929
00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:10,640
- Sure.
- <i>Now, uh...</i>

930
00:44:10,642 --> 00:44:13,711
<i>if you could just offer him
an extra 50 bucks</i>

931
00:44:13,713 --> 00:44:16,946
<i>on top of the 500 I owe him
for the extra days.</i>

932
00:44:16,948 --> 00:44:18,782
<i>No, wait.
No, no, listen.</i>

933
00:44:18,784 --> 00:44:22,151
<i>Don't offer him anything
unless he looks really upset.</i>

934
00:44:22,153 --> 00:44:24,655
<i>Even if he is,
let's start at 50,</i>

935
00:44:24,657 --> 00:44:26,356
<i>but don't go higher than 75.</i>

936
00:44:26,358 --> 00:44:27,758
<i>No, don't go higher than 100.</i>

937
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,461
- Yeah.
- <i>Okay! That's my boy!</i>

938
00:44:30,463 --> 00:44:31,894
<i>Now, listen,
you have a good time.</i>

939
00:44:31,896 --> 00:44:35,201
<i>Don't have too much fun
and no part...</i>

940
00:44:40,039 --> 00:44:41,338
You got any money?

941
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:43,106
I wanna get a paintball gun.

942
00:44:43,108 --> 00:44:45,742
Any money? No.

943
00:44:45,744 --> 00:44:48,646
You don't have any extra money
lying around?

944
00:44:48,648 --> 00:44:51,881
Just the food money that your dad left.
A paintball gun?

945
00:44:51,883 --> 00:44:54,984
Yeah. I think it'd be fun
to just wheel around

946
00:44:54,986 --> 00:44:56,653
and shoot one off, you know?

947
00:44:56,655 --> 00:45:01,624
No. I mean, uh, if I had
the money, yeah, sure.

948
00:45:01,626 --> 00:45:05,264
But I don't, so sorry,
no paintball gun.

949
00:45:14,372 --> 00:45:17,508
Sam!
Spilt my cereal!

950
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:19,278
Are you serious?

951
00:45:23,249 --> 00:45:25,418
Unbelievable.

952
00:45:27,753 --> 00:45:28,751
- Oh!
- Come on!

953
00:45:28,753 --> 00:45:30,053
Raspberries!

954
00:45:30,055 --> 00:45:32,492
You're crippled, not stupid.

955
00:45:34,492 --> 00:45:36,795
We're gonna need
more paper towels, too.

956
00:45:49,041 --> 00:45:50,341
Zoe.

957
00:45:50,343 --> 00:45:53,510
Jake, what's up?

958
00:45:53,512 --> 00:45:56,613
Jesus, I didn't realize
you were hurt that bad.

959
00:45:56,615 --> 00:46:00,983
Yeah. The car flipped over,
threw me a good 30 yards.

960
00:46:00,985 --> 00:46:02,686
Really?

961
00:46:02,688 --> 00:46:04,722
Yeah, it was pretty bad.

962
00:46:04,724 --> 00:46:09,459
The doctors
didn't even know if I'd...

963
00:46:09,461 --> 00:46:11,894
Not important.

964
00:46:11,896 --> 00:46:13,597
Are you gonna walk again?

965
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:14,631
Think so.

966
00:46:14,633 --> 00:46:17,334
I hope so.

967
00:46:17,336 --> 00:46:21,805
Uh, well, it'll knock
some sense into you.

968
00:46:21,807 --> 00:46:23,140
You would know.

969
00:46:23,142 --> 00:46:24,374
- What?
- No, no, no.

970
00:46:24,376 --> 00:46:26,542
I didn't mean to be cruel.

971
00:46:26,544 --> 00:46:29,345
I just meant with everything
that happened with your dad

972
00:46:29,347 --> 00:46:31,782
and your job.

973
00:46:31,784 --> 00:46:34,952
It was bad.
Worse, even.

974
00:46:34,954 --> 00:46:36,553
Yeah.

975
00:46:36,555 --> 00:46:40,657
I'm really sorry, Zoe.
Your dad was a great guy.

976
00:46:40,659 --> 00:46:43,162
It's okay.

977
00:46:44,896 --> 00:46:47,930
I'm gonna go inside.

978
00:46:47,932 --> 00:46:49,499
It was great seeing you.

979
00:46:49,501 --> 00:46:52,068
You just...
You forget, you know?

980
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:53,572
Sure.

981
00:46:55,407 --> 00:46:58,608
Zoe, can you do me a favor?

982
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:01,211
Uh, sure.

983
00:47:01,213 --> 00:47:04,347
You know how Sam used to have
a thing for you in high school?

984
00:47:04,349 --> 00:47:07,584
Um, yeah, I guess.

985
00:47:07,586 --> 00:47:09,986
Well, I've been using
the accident

986
00:47:09,988 --> 00:47:14,091
as this opportunity
to make things right with him,

987
00:47:14,093 --> 00:47:20,100
and I just know he'd think it
was weird if he knew we talked.

988
00:47:20,566 --> 00:47:23,367
Uh, okay.

989
00:47:23,369 --> 00:47:26,669
Uh, I'm sorry.
Okay, yeah, I understand.

990
00:47:26,671 --> 00:47:28,407
Thanks.

991
00:47:37,182 --> 00:47:40,517
<i>To Catch a Predator</i> is on.
Wasn't your dad on that show?

992
00:47:40,519 --> 00:47:42,686
No.

993
00:47:42,688 --> 00:47:46,088
Hey, it's 10:00.
You know where your kids are?

994
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:47,890
In bed with Sam's dad.

995
00:47:47,892 --> 00:47:50,359
Wait, what time is it?

996
00:47:50,361 --> 00:47:52,695
Hey, it's 10:00.
Do you know where your kids are?

997
00:47:52,697 --> 00:47:54,333
Gotta go!

998
00:48:10,182 --> 00:48:13,753
Sam, we need
more toilet paper!

999
00:48:14,954 --> 00:48:16,856
And Drano!

1000
00:48:27,365 --> 00:48:28,798
Are you waiting for me?

1001
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,300
No.

1002
00:48:31,302 --> 00:48:32,571
I don't know.
Maybe.

1003
00:48:34,273 --> 00:48:36,138
All right, come on,
let's go.

1004
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:37,474
What are we doing?

1005
00:48:37,476 --> 00:48:39,977
We're going for a walk.
You're too pale.

1006
00:48:39,979 --> 00:48:41,848
Okay.

1007
00:48:43,448 --> 00:48:45,215
Where's your dad?

1008
00:48:45,217 --> 00:48:47,450
He went on his honeymoon
with his new wife.

1009
00:48:47,452 --> 00:48:49,620
Oh, he's got
his priorities in order.

1010
00:48:49,622 --> 00:48:54,127
Well, I'm not used to my dad
not being an asshole.

1011
00:48:56,095 --> 00:48:58,128
Hey, Zoe?

1012
00:48:58,130 --> 00:48:59,432
Yeah?

1013
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:04,100
When I apologized yesterday,

1014
00:49:04,102 --> 00:49:06,769
I was apologizing
for everything.

1015
00:49:06,771 --> 00:49:08,638
What do you mean?

1016
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:13,977
I mean, I know it's a cop-out
to make a blanket apology,

1017
00:49:13,979 --> 00:49:16,280
but that's what this is.

1018
00:49:16,282 --> 00:49:17,851
I'm sorry.

1019
00:49:19,718 --> 00:49:22,818
It's cool. You prevented
me from ever dating

1020
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:28,425
anybody like you in college,
so I owe you a thank-you.

1021
00:49:28,427 --> 00:49:32,762
Well, I hope I'm not
like that anymore.

1022
00:49:32,764 --> 00:49:35,698
So tell me about your life
in Manhattan.

1023
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:38,334
- What do you wanna know?
- Everything.

1024
00:49:38,336 --> 00:49:41,104
Your job, your apartment,
your friends.

1025
00:49:41,106 --> 00:49:43,941
Just talk to me.

1026
00:49:43,943 --> 00:49:46,079
Okay.

1027
00:49:47,246 --> 00:49:51,013
Sam, you gotta do something
about Zoe.

1028
00:49:51,015 --> 00:49:52,416
I don't know.

1029
00:49:52,418 --> 00:49:54,885
Stop being a little bitch
and do something.

1030
00:49:54,887 --> 00:49:56,486
What is your problem?

1031
00:49:56,488 --> 00:50:00,856
Stop being a bitch and letting
people walk all over you.

1032
00:50:00,858 --> 00:50:02,327
Good call.

1033
00:50:08,499 --> 00:50:13,202
So are you seeing anyone
in Manhattan?

1034
00:50:13,204 --> 00:50:15,104
Right now?

1035
00:50:15,106 --> 00:50:19,376
Now or before, I guess.

1036
00:50:19,378 --> 00:50:21,381
Whatever answer you have.

1037
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,316
Not really.

1038
00:50:28,354 --> 00:50:30,689
I don't know
why I said not really.

1039
00:50:32,925 --> 00:50:34,861
I meant no.

1040
00:50:36,461 --> 00:50:39,428
What are you doing
tomorrow night?

1041
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:41,198
Nothing.

1042
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,966
You're not working?

1043
00:50:43,968 --> 00:50:45,434
No. Why?

1044
00:50:45,436 --> 00:50:48,771
Uh, I don't know.

1045
00:50:48,773 --> 00:50:50,573
Seriously. Why?

1046
00:50:50,575 --> 00:50:54,613
I'm just curious.
No reason.

1047
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:09,892
Wake up.
I need more pills.

1048
00:51:09,894 --> 00:51:11,428
Fill the prescription.

1049
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:12,695
Now.

1050
00:51:12,697 --> 00:51:14,232
Okay.

1051
00:51:19,671 --> 00:51:23,939
So did Sam talk to you
about you?

1052
00:51:23,941 --> 00:51:26,612
- What?
- Nothing.

1053
00:51:28,414 --> 00:51:30,747
- You know what'd be nice?
- What's that?

1054
00:51:30,749 --> 00:51:32,416
Me cooking you dinner.

1055
00:51:32,418 --> 00:51:34,984
What?

1056
00:51:34,986 --> 00:51:38,722
I've liked seeing you.
It's been great.

1057
00:51:38,724 --> 00:51:42,191
It's nice to know
that people can change.

1058
00:51:42,193 --> 00:51:44,428
It sounds like naive, but...

1059
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:48,765
you hope that it could happen,

1060
00:51:48,767 --> 00:51:51,401
think it might happen.

1061
00:51:51,403 --> 00:51:54,570
As glad as I am you've
turned over this new leaf,

1062
00:51:54,572 --> 00:51:56,238
you're not
cooking me dinner.

1063
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,841
- Why not?
- Jake...

1064
00:51:58,843 --> 00:52:02,079
you've burned that particular
bridge to the ground,

1065
00:52:02,081 --> 00:52:03,979
no matter how much
you've changed.

1066
00:52:03,981 --> 00:52:06,316
Zoe, I didn't mean it like that.

1067
00:52:06,318 --> 00:52:09,686
I meant me, you, and Sam
sitting down together,

1068
00:52:09,688 --> 00:52:11,088
spending some time.

1069
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:14,861
Oh.
Well, I'd like that.

1070
00:52:18,329 --> 00:52:21,798
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

1071
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,401
Do you think that Sam...

1072
00:52:24,403 --> 00:52:26,803
No. Trust me.
I know Sam.

1073
00:52:26,805 --> 00:52:29,439
He's the kind of guy
if he thinks something,

1074
00:52:29,441 --> 00:52:30,843
he says something.

1075
00:52:37,715 --> 00:52:38,981
What are you doing?

1076
00:52:38,983 --> 00:52:42,119
I am having someone
over for dinner.

1077
00:52:42,121 --> 00:52:43,854
Yeah, right.

1078
00:52:43,856 --> 00:52:45,425
I swear.

1079
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:48,258
Is there a punch line here?

1080
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:50,727
You gonna kick me in the balls
or something?

1081
00:52:50,729 --> 00:52:53,696
You know what?
Took your advice from the diner.

1082
00:52:53,698 --> 00:52:54,830
What's that?

1083
00:52:54,832 --> 00:52:56,166
Said I'm sorry.

1084
00:52:56,168 --> 00:52:57,834
Worked like a charm.

1085
00:52:57,836 --> 00:53:00,139
You're having Sara over?

1086
00:53:03,175 --> 00:53:05,477
I can't believe it.

1087
00:53:06,677 --> 00:53:08,246
Huh.

1088
00:53:12,284 --> 00:53:14,084
What are you doing?

1089
00:53:14,086 --> 00:53:17,086
Checking out your eye color.

1090
00:53:17,088 --> 00:53:19,321
That's the first tipoff
that an alien life form

1091
00:53:19,323 --> 00:53:21,224
is impersonating your body.

1092
00:53:21,226 --> 00:53:24,394
Wow.
It's a wonder other virgins

1093
00:53:24,396 --> 00:53:27,233
don't make pilgrimages
to worship you.

1094
00:53:29,802 --> 00:53:31,468
You want me to go anywhere?

1095
00:53:31,470 --> 00:53:34,470
I can go for a walk
or something.

1096
00:53:34,472 --> 00:53:35,671
If you want.

1097
00:53:35,673 --> 00:53:37,173
I can sit upstairs.

1098
00:53:37,175 --> 00:53:40,577
Yeah, if you want.
It's gonna get loud.

1099
00:53:40,579 --> 00:53:42,711
Fuck you.

1100
00:53:42,713 --> 00:53:44,580
No, Sam, Sam, seriously,

1101
00:53:44,582 --> 00:53:46,783
this girl made it seem like
she's only interested

1102
00:53:46,785 --> 00:53:49,019
in eating and fucking.

1103
00:53:49,021 --> 00:53:51,354
That's disgusting.

1104
00:53:51,356 --> 00:53:53,459
I'll close my door.

1105
00:54:02,233 --> 00:54:04,269
It's open!

1106
00:54:08,407 --> 00:54:10,774
Hey, Jake.
Dad's house looks nice.

1107
00:54:10,776 --> 00:54:13,309
Thanks.

1108
00:54:13,311 --> 00:54:17,046
So, um, where's the food?
What are we eating?

1109
00:54:17,048 --> 00:54:18,914
- You look great.
- Oh, really?

1110
00:54:18,916 --> 00:54:22,619
I can hear you guys talking,
and although it means nothing,

1111
00:54:22,621 --> 00:54:25,254
it's making me feel
kinda weird, so...

1112
00:54:25,256 --> 00:54:30,160
I'm... gonna go for a walk.

1113
00:54:30,162 --> 00:54:31,660
What the hell?

1114
00:54:31,662 --> 00:54:33,032
Hey, Sam.

1115
00:54:34,233 --> 00:54:37,867
Sam, meet Zoe.

1116
00:54:37,869 --> 00:54:40,370
Fuck you, Jake.

1117
00:54:40,372 --> 00:54:42,539
You unbelievable piece of shit.

1118
00:54:42,541 --> 00:54:44,307
I don't know
what's going on here.

1119
00:54:44,309 --> 00:54:47,146
If you leave, he's not gonna
pay you your money.

1120
00:54:48,947 --> 00:54:50,680
What?

1121
00:54:50,682 --> 00:54:55,352
He's not going to pay you
your money.

1122
00:54:55,354 --> 00:54:56,686
How do you know about that?

1123
00:54:56,688 --> 00:54:58,622
What kind of friend
takes money

1124
00:54:58,624 --> 00:55:01,390
from someone's father
to take care of them?

1125
00:55:01,392 --> 00:55:03,626
I mean, what the hell else
were you gonna do?

1126
00:55:03,628 --> 00:55:05,327
And you wouldn't even buy me
the paintball gun

1127
00:55:05,329 --> 00:55:06,729
when I asked you for it.

1128
00:55:06,731 --> 00:55:08,668
Yeah, that was a test, Sam.

1129
00:55:14,273 --> 00:55:16,506
You're out of your mind.

1130
00:55:16,508 --> 00:55:21,443
My mom and I live alone.
Paycheck to paycheck.

1131
00:55:21,445 --> 00:55:26,082
I gave her all that money
to help her out.

1132
00:55:26,084 --> 00:55:27,553
You get that at all?

1133
00:55:29,688 --> 00:55:31,657
Stand up.

1134
00:55:34,026 --> 00:55:37,526
I said stand up!
I know you can stand up.

1135
00:55:37,528 --> 00:55:39,129
Why?

1136
00:55:39,131 --> 00:55:41,698
'Cause I'm gonna
punch you in the face,

1137
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:44,203
and I'm not gonna hit
a guy in a wheelchair.

1138
00:56:04,021 --> 00:56:07,222
- What's the problem?
- Shut up.

1139
00:56:07,224 --> 00:56:10,392
You gonna do something,
do something.

1140
00:56:10,394 --> 00:56:12,562
Shut up.

1141
00:56:12,564 --> 00:56:15,597
- Do something.
- I don't have to do anything.

1142
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:17,466
Your girlfriend
didn't give a shit enough

1143
00:56:17,468 --> 00:56:19,336
to not fuck someone else.

1144
00:56:19,338 --> 00:56:21,805
Your dad didn't
care enough to stay.

1145
00:56:21,807 --> 00:56:23,807
You're all alone.

1146
00:56:23,809 --> 00:56:25,508
Nobody cares.

1147
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:28,447
Someone had to pay me to care.

1148
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:38,320
Zoe, this is bullshit.

1149
00:56:38,322 --> 00:56:42,694
I honestly thought you wouldn't
make the mistake twice.

1150
00:57:17,996 --> 00:57:19,662
Why did you do that?

1151
00:57:19,664 --> 00:57:22,568
Because of the money.

1152
00:57:25,771 --> 00:57:29,705
Jake, I'm 26 years old,

1153
00:57:29,707 --> 00:57:32,809
and my father just died.

1154
00:57:32,811 --> 00:57:36,812
I have no savings,
and I'm living at home.

1155
00:57:36,814 --> 00:57:39,115
And this?

1156
00:57:39,117 --> 00:57:42,484
This is the least important part
of my life.

1157
00:57:42,486 --> 00:57:45,387
You know,
you guys aren't 16 anymore.

1158
00:57:45,389 --> 00:57:47,222
He's not gonna be waiting
at the bus stop tomorrow

1159
00:57:47,224 --> 00:57:50,392
for you to make it up to him.

1160
00:57:50,394 --> 00:57:53,997
Nobody wants you to be
anything like your father.

1161
00:57:53,999 --> 00:57:56,202
You know that, right?

1162
00:57:58,169 --> 00:58:00,673
You're dad's not even here.

1163
00:58:53,057 --> 00:58:54,057
<i>Hello?</i>

1164
00:58:54,059 --> 00:58:56,729
Hey. I need help.

1165
00:59:02,901 --> 00:59:04,901
I think I broke my shoulder.

1166
00:59:04,903 --> 00:59:07,836
Why? What happened?

1167
00:59:07,838 --> 00:59:10,140
I punched Sam.

1168
00:59:10,142 --> 00:59:11,941
What'd you do?

1169
00:59:11,943 --> 00:59:13,843
- I punched him.
- I know.

1170
00:59:13,845 --> 00:59:16,211
What did you do?

1171
00:59:16,213 --> 00:59:18,381
I may have sabotaged
this thing he had going

1172
00:59:18,383 --> 00:59:19,816
with this girl he liked.

1173
00:59:19,818 --> 00:59:21,950
Well, you sprained it.

1174
00:59:21,952 --> 00:59:23,785
- It's not broken?
- No.

1175
00:59:23,787 --> 00:59:26,523
It's gonna be sore for a week,
so you need to figure this out.

1176
00:59:26,525 --> 00:59:28,624
- Get my friend back?
- No, I don't care about your relationship.

1177
00:59:28,626 --> 00:59:31,296
That's on you. You need
someone to take care of you.

1178
00:59:33,631 --> 00:59:35,097
So call the girl.

1179
00:59:35,099 --> 00:59:36,298
You call the girl,
fix it with her,

1180
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:37,399
and Sam will come back.

1181
00:59:37,401 --> 00:59:39,301
I don't know her number.

1182
00:59:39,303 --> 00:59:41,573
She lives across the street.

1183
00:59:45,577 --> 00:59:47,313
What, Jake?

1184
00:59:48,646 --> 00:59:51,247
I didn't mean anything I said.

1185
00:59:51,249 --> 00:59:53,182
I was being
a manipulative asshole.

1186
00:59:53,184 --> 00:59:54,550
Yeah, I know.

1187
00:59:54,552 --> 00:59:57,689
I know you know.
I just needed to tell you.

1188
00:59:59,023 --> 01:00:02,559
He's liked you
for a long time.

1189
01:00:02,561 --> 01:00:04,162
A lot.

1190
01:00:06,131 --> 01:00:09,231
I'm just being an idiot.

1191
01:00:09,233 --> 01:00:11,466
I saw you walking with him,

1192
01:00:11,468 --> 01:00:16,705
and my dad telling me about
Sam getting paid, it just...

1193
01:00:16,707 --> 01:00:19,043
It's me acting on
some shitty instinct.

1194
01:00:20,244 --> 01:00:22,711
Did you mean anything you said?

1195
01:00:22,713 --> 01:00:24,446
When?

1196
01:00:24,448 --> 01:00:26,351
When you said you were sorry.

1197
01:00:28,852 --> 01:00:30,820
I don't know.

1198
01:00:30,822 --> 01:00:33,756
I am sorry, though.

1199
01:00:33,758 --> 01:00:37,160
Your dad was a really cool guy.

1200
01:00:41,765 --> 01:00:43,233
What am I supposed to do now?

1201
01:00:43,235 --> 01:00:45,535
Wait for Sam to get back,
make some phone calls

1202
01:00:45,537 --> 01:00:48,771
and find someone else
to take care of you.

1203
01:00:48,773 --> 01:00:51,975
I don't know
that anyone else can.

1204
01:00:51,977 --> 01:00:54,611
Well, you gotta
figure this out, Jake.

1205
01:00:54,613 --> 01:00:56,445
Okay.

1206
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:59,548
You should call someone else.

1207
01:00:59,550 --> 01:01:00,649
Why?

1208
01:01:00,651 --> 01:01:02,318
Because Sam's
definitely coming back.

1209
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:04,787
Why do you say that?

1210
01:01:04,789 --> 01:01:07,957
Because he's sleeping
in your dad's car right now.

1211
01:01:07,959 --> 01:01:10,459
If he was gonna go,
he would have gone already.

1212
01:01:10,461 --> 01:01:12,461
Well, I need someone
to take care of me.

1213
01:01:12,463 --> 01:01:15,330
Listen, anyone you treat
the way you treat that kid,

1214
01:01:15,332 --> 01:01:17,503
maybe it's not the best thing.

1215
01:01:22,307 --> 01:01:23,872
I don't understand.

1216
01:01:23,874 --> 01:01:26,075
You're not the most perceptive
guy in the world.

1217
01:01:26,077 --> 01:01:28,747
Do you understand that?

1218
01:01:29,914 --> 01:01:30,979
I guess.

1219
01:01:30,981 --> 01:01:32,215
You guess?

1220
01:01:32,217 --> 01:01:34,050
You've hit on me
countless times.

1221
01:01:34,052 --> 01:01:37,553
I've countered countless times
by referring to my partner.

1222
01:01:37,555 --> 01:01:39,722
Not my boyfriend,
my partner.

1223
01:01:39,724 --> 01:01:42,727
Can you put
two and two together?

1224
01:01:44,396 --> 01:01:46,963
Maybe you need to reevaluate
your relationship with this kid.

1225
01:01:46,965 --> 01:01:49,164
But I gotta go. I have an
appointment in 20 minutes,

1226
01:01:49,166 --> 01:01:51,603
so I'll see you
next week, okay?

1227
01:03:13,818 --> 01:03:16,919
I don't want
to beat you up again.

1228
01:03:16,921 --> 01:03:21,090
I just wanna keep my head down,
finish out my time here.

1229
01:03:21,092 --> 01:03:25,227
Beat me up?
I punched you.

1230
01:03:25,229 --> 01:03:28,263
Whatever.
I just want to go upstairs

1231
01:03:28,265 --> 01:03:30,700
and sleep in a normal bed.

1232
01:03:30,702 --> 01:03:32,135
No.

1233
01:03:32,137 --> 01:03:33,369
What?

1234
01:03:33,371 --> 01:03:35,204
I want you to leave.

1235
01:03:35,206 --> 01:03:37,309
What the hell
you talking about?

1236
01:03:38,675 --> 01:03:40,642
I think...

1237
01:03:40,644 --> 01:03:43,646
and you can correct me
if I'm wrong...

1238
01:03:43,648 --> 01:03:48,117
that as long as I'm here,
you're gonna take care of me,

1239
01:03:48,119 --> 01:03:52,821
even if my father
doesn't pay you.

1240
01:03:52,823 --> 01:03:56,225
The thing is...

1241
01:03:56,227 --> 01:03:58,593
you don't like me.

1242
01:03:58,595 --> 01:04:02,798
- Not right now, no.
- No, you don't like me at all.

1243
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:05,200
And that's okay.

1244
01:04:05,202 --> 01:04:08,604
I'm an asshole.

1245
01:04:08,606 --> 01:04:11,573
But for some reason,

1246
01:04:11,575 --> 01:04:17,012
me being an asshole
has just caused you to stop.

1247
01:04:17,014 --> 01:04:19,115
And that's not okay.

1248
01:04:19,117 --> 01:04:20,716
I don't think...

1249
01:04:20,718 --> 01:04:22,287
Seriously.

1250
01:04:24,389 --> 01:04:26,088
We're not friends.

1251
01:04:26,090 --> 01:04:29,392
We're just used to each other.

1252
01:04:29,394 --> 01:04:32,260
So I need you to just leave.

1253
01:04:32,262 --> 01:04:35,798
I need you to go write
an SAT prep book

1254
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,800
or date Zoe

1255
01:04:37,802 --> 01:04:39,602
or do anything...

1256
01:04:39,604 --> 01:04:42,504
as long as I'm just
not involved and far away.

1257
01:04:42,506 --> 01:04:45,475
Just do something so
that I don't feel

1258
01:04:45,477 --> 01:04:49,745
like I fucked this up so bad.

1259
01:04:49,747 --> 01:04:54,182
We were best friends, man.

1260
01:04:54,184 --> 01:04:56,318
Probably the best
when we were 10,

1261
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:59,988
and then we never changed.

1262
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:02,360
That sucks.

1263
01:05:06,097 --> 01:05:08,633
But we don't have
to be friends now.

1264
01:05:13,671 --> 01:05:16,305
Okay.

1265
01:05:16,307 --> 01:05:19,041
But who's gonna
take care of you?

1266
01:05:19,043 --> 01:05:22,178
I called Sara.
She said do it for 500.

1267
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:24,116
Don't worry about it.

1268
01:05:27,952 --> 01:05:30,055
See you later.

1269
01:05:33,057 --> 01:05:34,459
Okay.

1270
01:05:46,771 --> 01:05:50,506
By the time I'm 16,
she's gonna be 28 or something.

1271
01:05:50,508 --> 01:05:52,874
She slapped you pretty hard.

1272
01:05:52,876 --> 01:05:58,381
Yeah, well, you gotta make
an omelet to break some eggs.

1273
01:05:58,383 --> 01:06:02,684
What? That's not
what you meant to say.

1274
01:06:02,686 --> 01:06:04,921
How would you know?

1275
01:06:04,923 --> 01:06:07,023
That made no sense.

1276
01:06:07,025 --> 01:06:11,095
In the future, keep those
kinda things to yourself.

1277
01:06:15,465 --> 01:06:17,633
I got a lot more candy
than you.

1278
01:06:17,635 --> 01:06:21,139
- Yeah, I know.
- Let's even it out.

1279
01:06:29,713 --> 01:06:31,513
Thanks.

1280
01:06:31,515 --> 01:06:36,419
Yeah, well, get used to it.
It's not gonna last forever.

1281
01:06:36,421 --> 01:06:39,821
<i>Uh, I think you meant
don't get used to it.</i>

1282
01:06:39,823 --> 01:06:41,793
I mean shut up.

1283
01:12:14,191 --> 01:12:16,461
- <i>Camera speed.</i>
- Marker.

1284
01:12:17,628 --> 01:12:19,694
<i>All quiet.</i>

1285
01:12:19,696 --> 01:12:22,297
<i>Set.</i>

1286
01:12:22,299 --> 01:12:24,335
<i>And action.</i>

1287
01:12:25,835 --> 01:12:28,604
Why did my daughter
just call me delusional?

1288
01:12:28,606 --> 01:12:31,140
I don't know.
Did you say something crazy?

1289
01:12:31,142 --> 01:12:33,943
No. I walked in from the den,
and she said I was delusional.

1290
01:12:33,945 --> 01:12:37,479
Sam, she doesn't know that word
unless you taught it to her.

1291
01:12:37,481 --> 01:12:40,382
Linda, it's probably
an SAT word.

1292
01:12:40,384 --> 01:12:42,217
<i>I don't know
what delusional means.</i>

1293
01:12:42,219 --> 01:12:43,953
<i>But it's okay, Mom.</i>

1294
01:12:43,955 --> 01:12:47,221
<i>Mr. Sanderson says I'm not smart
enough for any of this anyway.</i>

1295
01:12:47,223 --> 01:12:49,725
- <i>For Christ sakes.</i>
- That's...

1296
01:12:49,727 --> 01:12:52,694
Listen, I didn't say
those words exactly.

1297
01:12:52,696 --> 01:12:55,230
I said something very similar to it.
I'm not gonna lie.

1298
01:12:55,232 --> 01:12:58,300
The important thing is that I
didn't say those words exactly.

1299
01:12:58,302 --> 01:13:00,034
What exactly did you say?

1300
01:13:00,036 --> 01:13:04,273
I said she's not smart enough
for this stuff right now.

1301
01:13:04,275 --> 01:13:06,007
- What?
- She's not!

1302
01:13:06,009 --> 01:13:07,443
Linda, this stuff is tough.

1303
01:13:07,445 --> 01:13:09,877
You got her doing it
at ten years old.

1304
01:13:09,879 --> 01:13:14,551
Hey, you! Sun is to shining
like your mom is to what?

1305
01:13:17,321 --> 01:13:19,520
Delusional.
See?

1306
01:13:19,522 --> 01:13:21,657
I'm just trying to give her
a head start.

1307
01:13:21,659 --> 01:13:23,425
A healthy head start
is six months.

1308
01:13:23,427 --> 01:13:25,093
The whole point of the SATs

1309
01:13:25,095 --> 01:13:27,695
is that a ten-year-old
shouldn't be able to do it.

1310
01:13:27,697 --> 01:13:29,898
Who are you to determine
whether my daughter

1311
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:31,699
is ready or not for SAT prep?

1312
01:13:31,701 --> 01:13:33,702
I think I'm exactly the right
person to determine that.

1313
01:13:33,704 --> 01:13:36,238
I'm the SAT tutor.
Am I being unreasonable?

1314
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:38,740
Sam, I don't think you're
the right person for this job.

1315
01:13:38,742 --> 01:13:40,275
- Are you firing me?
- Yes, I am.

1316
01:13:40,277 --> 01:13:42,778
- You gonna pay me for today?
- Fine!

1317
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:46,681
Please, please go outside
and play with your friends.

1318
01:13:46,683 --> 01:13:48,751
Do not order
my daughter around!

1319
01:13:48,753 --> 01:13:50,752
The streets are
the greatest classroom.

1320
01:13:50,754 --> 01:13:52,589
She can't unhear that.

1321
01:13:55,326 --> 01:13:56,461
<i>Cut!</i>

1322
01:13:56,463 --> 01:14:01,463
