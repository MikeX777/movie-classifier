1
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:10,481
This is the story
of how my town, Salem,

2
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:12,896
lost its motherfucking mind.

3
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:24,373
Now I understand that
you may think I'm exaggerating,

4
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:26,159
that I'm being hyperbolic...

5
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:34,584
that there's no way an entire
suburb could freak the fuck out

6
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:37,674
to the degree they'd want
to kill four teenage girls.

7
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,179
But I promise you...

8
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:48,349
this is 100 percent
a true story.

9
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,239
I will warn you, though,
it gets pretty graphic.

10
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:03,516
Fight!

11
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:08,785
Fuck that faggot!

12
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,167
You're not getting it.
I'm on your side here.

13
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,421
- Run, Lily!
- Kiss me.

14
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,177
Wake up, people!

15
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,452
This is high school.

16
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,726
We are all victims.

17
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:30,641
My name is Lily Colson,
and I'm 18 years old.

18
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:33,518
These are my three best friends:

19
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,570
Em.

20
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:36,489
Bex.

21
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,151
And Sarah.

22
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,486
And to be honest...

23
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,652
I don't know if we're gonna live
through the night.

24
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,936
But let's start
at the beginning.

25
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,314
You could be a fucking porn star,
you know that?

26
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,421
Actually, not here.

27
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:54,817
Because what I did that
afternoon was really gross.

28
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,105
Lily! Lily!

29
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:17,649
- Hey, babe! Slow down.
- Carlie, Carlie!

30
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,532
You can't run... Stop, stop!
You can't run on a road.

31
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,199
Come on.

32
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,281
Carlie,
don't scare us like that.

33
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,867
We always say,
"No going in the street without adults."

34
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,873
- Hey.
- Hi.

35
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,645
- Um, how are you?
- I'm sorry. I'm good.

36
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,831
- Nice to see you.
- How are you?

37
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,357
We wish you'd come back to us.
I mean, she misses you so much.

38
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,543
Oh, no, I miss you guys, too.
I just um...

39
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:40,505
It's hard with, you know,
school and college applications and all that.

40
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,136
But I miss you!

41
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,264
I know, baby, I miss you, too.

42
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,286
See you soon, all right?

43
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,846
Well, we should...

44
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,262
You know, I gotta get her
in the bath, so...

45
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,334
But if you're ever free, if you have a
free night, just come by for dinner.

46
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,065
Okay, cool, yeah.
Sounds good.

47
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,550
- Yeah, good to see you.
- Okay, yeah, you too.

48
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:05,326
So, hey, you can really see the
difference the lotion made, right?

49
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,532
So... this is supposed
to help your digestion.

50
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,078
What's going on, Lily?

51
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,208
Just another happy day.

52
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:19,583
Have you been crying?

53
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:24,011
No. No, no. Some boy just shoved
his fingers down my throat.

54
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:29,764
- Ugh... Wow.
- Not as sexy as it sounds.

55
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,387
Well, the girls are upstairs.
You can...

56
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:33,814
Cool.

57
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,607
She seems nice.

58
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,311
You dog.

59
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:49,954
- What up?
- Hey, baby.

60
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:50,954
- Hey.
- Hey, how are you?

61
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,456
Good. Hey.
Hey.

62
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,584
Wait, have you been crying?

63
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,397
No. No, no. Hey,
who's the rapist on the couch with your mom?

64
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,741
It's too depressing to talk about.
So, let's just let it go.

65
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,444
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna throw up.

66
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,425
Whatever.
Who's Sir Rapes-a-Lot?

67
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,338
Okay, all the rape jokes are
making me seriously uncomfortable.

68
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,176
He's very rapey.

69
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,182
It's true. He is really rapey.

70
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:12,640
It's like mace first,
ask questions later.

71
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,373
Totally, Bex, you can't even get upset.

72
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:21,561
What's his name?

73
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:24,697
I don't know, some guy.
I never ever let her introduce me. Ever.

74
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,219
Do you guys know
who's been sexting Bex?

75
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,326
- Sexting Bex?
- Who's been sexting Bex?

76
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,488
- Okay, fuck you. Fuck you.
- I'm sorry.

77
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:36,080
Bex,
who is it? Who is it?

78
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,834
- Okay.
- No, who is it?

79
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,999
If I tell you, you have to
promise not to tell anyone.

80
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,984
Of course. Who is it?
Please, just be quiet.

81
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,927
Diamond.

82
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:49,339
No, like football, bro tank-top,
dumb-as-shit, Diamond?

83
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,633
Oh, my God. That is so hot!

84
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,268
He's literally
the Latino Tom Cruise.

85
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:57,646
Have you seen his dick in a pair of
gray sweatpants. Yes, duh.

86
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,557
- Obviously!
- Yes!

87
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,225
But it's not even a thing.

88
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,190
We had a lab together.

89
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,132
And now he's always texting me
at like one in the morning,

90
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,318
- being like, "What are you doing?"
- Fuck-boy hours.

91
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,928
And I'm like, "Literally nothing.
I'm doing nothing." It's nothing.

92
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,096
Oh, God. Bex, you're so lame.
It's nothing.

93
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,280
I know, right?
It's nothing...

94
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,364
Wait, wait. Speaking of which...

95
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,783
Lily, has Mark gone down
on you yet?

96
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:19,418
- Oh!
- Don't do this.

97
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,983
Seriously, girl,
you told me you were gonna break up with him

98
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,999
unless he goes down on you.

99
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,153
I know. It's just so hard.
I don't know what to do...

100
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,590
Let me just break it down
to you like this.

101
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:33,554
Men who don't eat pussy in this day and
age are straight-up sociopathic, okay?

102
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:36,390
Oh, my God.
Am I wrong? Where's the lie?

103
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,430
If only it was that easy...

104
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,474
Em, can I tweet that thing about guys
not eating pussy is sociopathic?

105
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,768
Totally.
Spread the good word, girl.

106
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,062
Consent, thank you.
Confirmed. Tweet!

107
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,080
Look, if I'm gonna have a body
like Zac Efron,

108
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:03,212
you should have a body like
whoever Zac Efron be fucking.

109
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,748
I heard there was a party
at Greenwald's tonight.

110
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,962
- Yeah.
- But who the fuck is Greenwald?

111
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,780
I think he's the tall,
lanky kid with anime eyes.

112
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,217
Oh, yeah? Whatever.
Who the fuck are you, Greenwald?

113
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,507
And where the fuck do you live,
bitch?

114
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:20,138
She thinks she can catfish my man
with her fucking wack-ass finsta.

115
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,183
Think again, bitch.
This pussy whips!

116
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,352
We're about to get some drinks.
We're about to get some pussy.

117
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:32,609
That's my politics.
Now go play football. We win, baby!

118
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,056
What the fuck?

119
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:10,781
Holy shit.

120
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,649
Mayor Bartlett...

121
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,578
Fuck...

122
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,833
What the fuck?

123
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:29,465
Fucking politicians.

124
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,592
Fuck you.

125
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,044
Fuck you.

126
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,467
Who is that?

127
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,262
Mayor Bartlett dressed as a woman,
fucking masturbating.

128
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,726
Oh, my God!

129
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,836
Why do middle-aged men who cross dress
always have the worst taste in lingerie?

130
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,943
I know, right?
Why is that a thing?

131
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,881
- Where did you get this?
- That's not even the worst thing.

132
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,092
- What do you mean?
- Mayor Bartlett is gonna see Mason?

133
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,116
I mean, like...
What?

134
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,275
Dude's getting fucking fucked.

135
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,366
I want to see that right now!

136
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,030
That's the mayor? Oh, hell no!

137
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,074
Fuck that shit, dude.
That's nasty.

138
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,354
Yo, that motherfucker's been
in the locker room with us, bro.

139
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,745
- You getting some memories, Johnny?
- Why... Shut up.

140
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:12,337
Why is it always the people who are,
like, against LGBTQIAA rights

141
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,092
that are like, trigger warning,

142
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,698
- the biggest fucking faggots.
- One thousand percent.

143
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,714
Face swap Bartlett
for Ryan Gosling.

144
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:20,383
Wait, isn't he like married with kids?
I don't want that.

145
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:23,052
- Yeah, but she's gross.
- Unassociated.

146
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,890
Excuse me.
Excuse me, sorry, sorry.

147
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,934
I am leaving my body
as a cushion.

148
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,666
- Excuse me, excuse me.
- Good night.

149
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,237
Where you going?

150
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,573
Can I still call my mom?

151
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,631
Don't look. But Diamond
is eye-fucking me so hard right now.

152
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,592
Oh yeah? Let's give him
something to look at.

153
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:14,021
They tell you that if you're honest,
and you say what you feel,

154
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,904
then you'll get what you want.

155
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:25,577
I don't want to feel like I'm
babysitting you all the fucking time.

156
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,038
I don't understand
what the fuck you want from me.

157
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:32,000
The truth is,
no one wants the real you.

158
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:35,921
Well, fuck off!
Go fuck yourself. Go fuck yourself.

159
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,799
So you stop telling
the truth.

160
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,597
You lie to your friends.

161
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,343
You lie to your family.

162
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,146
You lie to everyone...

163
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,768
who says they love you
for being you.

164
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,362
Because guess what?

165
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,191
They're lying, too.

166
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,638
They only want pieces and parts.

167
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,895
They want to pick and choose.

168
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:38,437
They want that laugh,
with that smile.

169
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:44,444
That pic, with that confidence.

170
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,452
That girl,
with that willingness.

171
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,829
But not her. Not like that.

172
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,627
And to be honest...

173
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,085
He's perfect.

174
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,595
He's sweet.

175
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:05,681
He's gorgeous.

176
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:11,729
And you're lucky, so be happy.

177
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,681
Be grateful.

178
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:16,316
Be hashtag "blessed."

179
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,438
Because the whole world's
always watching.

180
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:22,693
And waiting.

181
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:27,653
And it's only a matter of time
before you fuck it all up.

182
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:29,989
I didn't know you smoked.

183
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,416
All the time.
Yeah.

184
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,208
They're not, like, super big.

185
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:19,622
Or anything.

186
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,591
Perfect.

187
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:49,493
Wait...

188
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:25,515
- You okay?
- Yeah.

189
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,661
Well...

190
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:40,578
I'll see you in Bio.

191
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:52,516
You, um...

192
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,888
I mean, you can't tell anyone
about this, right?

193
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,521
Yeah. Yeah, I get it.

194
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,556
How are you feeling?

195
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:47,611
I'm fine.

196
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,943
It's like whatever, you know?

197
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:03,953
Okay, okay, okay...

198
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:09,458
So far,
that shit is fucking amazing.

199
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:12,197
You just know they're gonna have
a press conference

200
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:15,339
and Bartlett's wife is just
gonna be standing there like

201
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:19,806
the literal human embodiment of
the gritting teeth emoji, like...

202
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,562
Ah! I live for this type
of scandal, to be honest.

203
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:26,692
Guys, the Casey Anthony trial?
Oh, my God. And we had just gotten Tivo.

204
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,479
Yo, remember when
Casey's nudes leaked?

205
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:34,366
Those were 108 percent
"I brutally murdered my daughter" nudes.

206
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,722
Okay, she was found
not guilty, Bex. That's libel.

207
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:37,806
What the fuck's
Casey gonna do?

208
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,662
Sue me and reopen
that can of worms?

209
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:43,166
Oh, my God. That reminds me.
I have a 20,000-word Nancy Grace fanfic

210
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:44,793
in my draft right now.

211
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,607
I literally forget how weird
you are sometimes,

212
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,233
and then you just pull up
some shit like that.

213
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,670
No, no, no.
It's actually super legit.

214
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:54,962
- Oh, my God. I love this song.
- What song?

215
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,175
This song.

216
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,375
It's amazing how someone
so inconsequential

217
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,291
can make you feel
so inconsequential.

218
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,172
Fuck fuck-boys.

219
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:38,259
Fuck fuck-boys.

220
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,682
Hold your head high.

221
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,260
Let's do this.
Okay.

222
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,231
Looking good, Bex.

223
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:49,276
What?

224
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,309
I said, "Looking good today."

225
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,104
Obviously.

226
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:08,960
Am I in trouble?

227
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,580
Why the guilty conscience?

228
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,988
I still don't see how
the drawings are explicit.

229
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,253
Lily, Lily...

230
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:23,760
These are pictures of naked
women in pornographic poses.

231
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,437
It's not just explicit.
It's extreme.

232
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,645
What's extreme, the drawings?

233
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:33,936
Or the fact that there are five
billion naked selfies online?

234
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:36,406
I mean...

235
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,901
I was asked to draw from life.

236
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,406
- And this is life.
- Well, now, no, no, no...

237
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,538
It's an aspect of life, sure.

238
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:48,038
But I'd argue that there are
many other areas of life

239
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,951
that are more deserving
of your talent.

240
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:52,629
Ooh. I disagree.

241
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:58,511
But... you're a man.
I don't expect you to understand.

242
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:04,476
Try me.

243
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:12,145
All you're looking at
is the nudity.

244
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,768
But this isn't about that.

245
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,858
This isn't about the sex
or the porn or even being naked.

246
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:20,274
This is about everything
that goes into it.

247
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,578
The pressure.
The endless mindfuck.

248
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:28,616
The 10,000 naked selfies
you took before this one,

249
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,375
trying to get it just right.

250
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:35,502
Trying to make sure the light
hides your left nipple,

251
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:38,462
because it's slightly inverted
or it's smaller.

252
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,503
Or maybe your labia's too big.

253
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:43,968
But if you pull your
pelvic bone up,

254
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,347
and bend to the left slightly
in a low-light setting...

255
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,637
then you'll be beautiful.

256
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,683
Hashtag flawless.
Body confident.

257
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:59,734
But it's all one big lie.
You can never be.

258
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:04,235
Because nobody's flawless,
and all it takes is one fucking asshole

259
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,697
to remind you of that.

260
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:08,910
One guy to say "lol"
or "she's nasty."

261
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,249
And you're right back
at square one.

262
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,452
So, okay.

263
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:16,338
Maybe it is explicit or extreme.

264
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,716
But it sure as hell looks
like life to me.

265
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,551
What...

266
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,933
Okay, look.
Shit. Lily...

267
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:32,437
You really caught me off-guard
with this one, okay?

268
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:37,651
Okay, it's obvious.
You're extraordinarily talented.

269
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:39,687
With your grades
and your talent,

270
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,901
you'll be able to go
to the school of your choice.

271
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,607
Hey, listen to me.

272
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,321
People are gonna take notice.

273
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,486
They're gonna listen.

274
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:49,450
But hey, Lily?

275
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,665
Right now, this is high school.

276
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,327
Okay? High. School.

277
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:58,414
And whether fair or unfair,

278
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,170
there's a limit
to what you can say.

279
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,295
Capisce?

280
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,555
Capisce.

281
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:10,516
Grazie.

282
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,473
Prego.

283
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:08,762
Look,
I got City Council breathing down my neck.

284
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:11,870
I got ninth graders sharing
videos of our new tranny mayor,

285
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:13,655
making him an Internet star.

286
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,477
I mean, you know, everybody's
in an uproar over this.

287
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:18,869
Are you telling me
there's nothing the FBI

288
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,997
or anybody can do
to get these videos down?

289
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,374
Unfortunately, sir, it's...

290
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,884
It's very difficult
to stop the Internet.

291
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:29,216
Do we have any idea
who's behind this?

292
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,848
Look, we're seeing things like
this a thousand times a day.

293
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,305
We just had a kid in Tulsa hack
an entire football stadium

294
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,094
with a jailbroken iPhone
in 60 seconds.

295
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:38,433
So, hard to say who's behind any of this.

296
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:42,275
I hate the fucking Internet.

297
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:45,604
So, I'm standing here with Salem
High School junior, Bex Warren.

298
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:48,319
Bex,
who do you think Erostratus is?

299
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,656
I think it was some, like,
socially conscious, vigilante hacker guy.

300
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,072
To be honest, I'm disappointed.
I'm angry.

301
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:59,209
This pervert ran
on a "family values" platform.

302
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:04,044
I mean, where do you draw the line?
The bar is so low.

303
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:07,209
So, it's just sick. Sick!

304
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:09,878
Sir, do you think
your stance on the LGBT community

305
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,923
is hypocritical in light of
recent allegations? Sir? Sir?

306
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,517
Sir?

307
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,365
He was a member there...

308
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,155
Hey.

309
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,138
What did you do?

310
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:54,510
What did you do?
What did you do?

311
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:56,967
What did you do?

312
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,349
What did you do?

313
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,403
There he is!

314
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,506
Resign! Resign!

315
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:33,803
Resign!

316
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:37,758
I don't want to hurt anyone.
I don't want to hurt anyone!

317
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:00,830
He says,
"I'm perpetually at war.

318
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:04,493
Not with you or the life
we've chosen, but with myself.

319
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:06,332
I know I'm better than this,
Leslie.

320
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,713
I just sometimes fear

321
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:12,296
I don't have the constitution to be
the man that I promised you I was."

322
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:15,428
I'd be, like,
"Lol, byeeeee!"

323
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:17,885
You're bad.
What did she say back?

324
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:23,888
"Michael, your 15 years of marriage,
too late for this conversation.

325
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,477
The kids and I expect
to see you at dinner."

326
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,944
I mean, cry me a fucking river.

327
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,906
What?
This is a guy who spent his whole life

328
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,534
trying to deny
LGBTQIAA people their rights.

329
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:40,696
Yeah, but it doesn't mean
it's not sad.

330
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:43,365
I mean, can you imagine
how lonely he must have felt?

331
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:46,751
You're asking me if I can imagine
how Tranny Bartlett must have felt?

332
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:49,538
It's different.
You had the courage to be yourself.

333
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,168
Meaning what, Lily?

334
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:56,211
I had the choice to be somebody else,
but my courage got me this far?

335
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,674
That's not what I meant.

336
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:59,464
Whatever.
All I'm saying is fuck him.

337
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,141
He was a hypocrite.
I have zero sympathy.

338
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:04,849
People like me kill themselves
every fucking day,

339
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,763
and bigots like him
aren't shedding tears.

340
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:11,518
He wouldn't mourn my death,
so why the fuck should I mourn his, bitch?

341
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:16,523
I think you can disagree
with him and still feel empathy.

342
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,533
Yeah, maybe you. Not me.

343
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:22,988
You guys
have a computer club, right?

344
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,702
Yeah.

345
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,770
Do they use their own computers
or the school's computers?

346
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:29,457
It's a mixture.
They meet in the computer lab.

347
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,332
I'd like to get a list
of those students.

348
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:37,280
You know, I'm having a hard time believing
any of our students would be involved

349
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,387
in something like this.

350
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:44,058
I feel like they'd be more inclined to
go after a teacher or a fellow student.

351
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:45,310
Me.

352
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,971
But not the mayor.

353
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,224
I'm sorry.

354
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,819
Oh... It's the superintendent.
Hold on.

355
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,739
- Hi, Lisa.
- Calvin, are you by your computer?

356
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,571
No, not at the moment. Why?

357
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,667
What do you mean "everything"?

358
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:29,805
Okay, anyone can read anything
we've sent to each other, since...?

359
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:31,188
Since I got a phone.

360
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,642
Since you got a phone,
or this phone?

361
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:39,030
Well, the SIM card. I mean,
I haven't deleted anything in, like, what?

362
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,610
So, what, five years?

363
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,615
What have we talked about?

364
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:49,495
Jesus... what have we said?

365
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,705
Baby, what did the doctor say?

366
00:27:56,758 --> 00:28:00,126
He said a lot of women
over the age of 40 miscarry.

367
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:03,513
Let me just read a few of the Pornhub
videos our principal has viewed

368
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:05,139
over the last couple months.

369
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,346
"Cute teen makes her pussy pulse
with orgasm."

370
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:12,309
Principal Turrell couldn't even make
amends with his father before he died.

371
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,565
Like, that's really cold.

372
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:15,896
Like his wife was begging him to

373
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,547
and he couldn't put aside
his own bullshit.

374
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:19,483
It's like you have no emotion.

375
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,988
Just saying.

376
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:23,400
But the main thing we need
to talk about

377
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:25,555
are the eight nude photos of his
daughter in his iPhoto library.

378
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:26,945
Have you seen the pictures?

379
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:29,614
They're from three
and a half years ago,

380
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:32,312
which would have made Allison Turrell
only six and a half when they were taken.

381
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:34,828
She's in the bath,
and you can see everything.

382
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,123
Disgusting! Oh, my God!

383
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:40,167
Let me ask you,
Principal Turrell,

384
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,962
did your 6-year-old daughter
consent to those?

385
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:48,411
Well, I got the email about the
school board meeting tomorrow night?

386
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,622
Gonna vote on whether to fire the principal.

387
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:53,980
There was always something about
him that just didn't sit right with me.

388
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:55,310
Hmm.

389
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:56,566
You and a lot of people.

390
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:02,651
I mean, I just find
the whole thing very disturbing.

391
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:06,280
Disturbing?

392
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,820
There are boundaries, Lily,
between a father and a daughter.

393
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,373
You may not believe that, but there are.
Absolutely.

394
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,751
I was never comfortable seeing
you naked after you were two.

395
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,337
Why?

396
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,424
You're my daughter.

397
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,250
Not a good enough reason.

398
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,544
But that's exactly what I mean.
I'm your daughter.

399
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:25,837
Why would you be weirded out?

400
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:28,548
Lily, that's enough.

401
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:31,555
All I'm trying to say...

402
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:35,393
is that nudity isn't
inherently sexual.

403
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:37,808
And it's the same thing
with these photos.

404
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:41,398
They're not sexual.
It's you guys that are making them sexual.

405
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,189
Okay, just because a young girl is naked,
doesn't mean it's sexual

406
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:45,322
or creepy or pervy.

407
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,324
And it doesn't make him
a child molester.

408
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:49,577
Lily, give me a break.

409
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:52,364
Mom, there's a naked photo of me on
the mantelpiece at two years old.

410
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:54,658
Do you think
that is child pornography?

411
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:58,454
Lily, I am not going to sit here and
listen to you defend a child molester.

412
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,858
But that's my point,
he's not a child molester.

413
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:03,795
He is a victim in this.
Just like his daughter.

414
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:06,173
Lily, you like to debate.

415
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,008
And I respect that.

416
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,701
You want to play devil's advocate.
You're smart.

417
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:12,559
You don't know the first thing
about this world, sweetheart.

418
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:17,393
And you call us prudes, old-fashioned,
but I'm gonna tell you something.

419
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:19,398
I've been
on this earth 45 years,

420
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:20,809
and if there's one thing I know,

421
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:23,023
men will be men,
girls will be girls,

422
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:26,235
and until you can protect yourself,
I'm going to do that for you.

423
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,077
Wow.

424
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:43,122
You guys ever see that video of
the family on safari in Africa?

425
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:45,918
And they get mauled
by like seven tigers?

426
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,095
No, Donny.

427
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,014
I missed it.

428
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,727
It's pretty cool.

429
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,722
Hey, Principal Turrell.

430
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,866
What do you have
to hide anyway though?

431
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,771
Excuse me?

432
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,311
Have you seen her...?

433
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:14,232
I mean, like a million nudes,
super gross porn history,

434
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:16,321
super pervy texts,

435
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:20,204
and, like, life-altering shit-talk
about almost everyone at this school.

436
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:21,248
And my family.

437
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,374
Fair enough.

438
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,499
- Me too.
- Me three.

439
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:27,161
My iPhoto looks like
a fucking snuff film.

440
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,207
- I love you.
- Hopefully nudes...

441
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:33,630
What are you doing?

442
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,135
Looking
at Turrell's hack.

443
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:39,007
One hundred and forty-two
thousand downloads, that's like...

444
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:41,183
three times the size of Salem.

445
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:44,517
I'm sorry, but I just
don't have, like, any sympathy

446
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,643
for people
that get their shit hacked.

447
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:49,275
For real?

448
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:51,547
Yeah, I mean, there's two types of
people in this world, you know?

449
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:55,030
Like, the people that have come to
terms with privacy is just dead.

450
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:56,844
And, like, you know,
then there's the old people

451
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,188
that are still trying
to fight it.

452
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:01,996
- I guess.
- I mean, the Internet is amazing.

453
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,954
Like, this guy in Minnesota,
he's like 42, whatever.

454
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:09,666
But basically he subscribed
to my Amazon wish list

455
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,707
and now legit he just buys
me shit all the time.

456
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,250
Why?

457
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,072
I don't know. I guess he just
really likes my Insta, you know?

458
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:19,214
Like, he likes that I'm real
and, like, I'm cool,

459
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:21,202
and, you know, I'm a free soul.

460
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:24,139
It's really sad,
because basically 90 percent of people

461
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:28,397
are just so sad and lonely and
have such an unfulfilling life.

462
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:33,190
If I'm, like, inspiring people,
you know, and my life is so cool

463
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:35,696
and, like, people connect
with me on such a level,

464
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,949
then, like, basically my job
for the day is done.

465
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:42,431
But what's that got
to do with people's shit getting hacked?

466
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:43,912
Oh, hold on.

467
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,494
I gotta get this. Hi, baby!

468
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,086
Bye, baby!

469
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:51,121
Um... Okay...

470
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,090
Come here.

471
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,257
Yeah, come here.

472
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:58,298
I love a little
Princess Leia hair.

473
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:04,638
Carrie, if you're
listening, we miss you.

474
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:11,398
The thing to do is to
go out there and speak from the heart.

475
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:15,319
Tell the board and the parents what
being principal has meant to you

476
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:16,979
for the last nine years.

477
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:20,196
Tell them you understand
their concerns.

478
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,156
And resign with grace.

479
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,169
Mark.

480
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:35,674
Mark?

481
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,421
Hello?

482
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:41,758
Dude, what are you doing?

483
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,385
Agh!

484
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:46,245
- What the fuck!
- Oh, yeah, got you now, bitch!

485
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,509
- Help me!
- Got you now!

486
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:52,690
Oh, my God! You piece of shit.
You should have seen your fucking face.

487
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:54,350
You piece of shit.
It was a fucking joke.

488
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,985
Goddammit.
Oh, my God. Priceless.

489
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,737
Hey, come here. Come here.

490
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,736
You should have seen
your stupid face.

491
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:07,873
Whatever.

492
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,330
What are you doing tonight?

493
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:13,744
Em and Sarah might be having
some people over.

494
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:16,835
Oh, yeah? That's what I heard.
Hmm. Look at you.

495
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:19,626
Yeah, am I invited?
Hmm...

496
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,594
Guess I can ask.

497
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,430
See you there.

498
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,961
I know I've met
a lot of you before.

499
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,460
But in light
of the circumstances...

500
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:04,128
Please, let him speak.

501
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:05,556
Thank you.

502
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:08,015
I'd like to just
introduce myself to you.

503
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:11,014
And tell you
why I became a teacher.

504
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,770
- Because you're a pedophile!
- Yeah!

505
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,481
I grew up not far from here.

506
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:20,524
In a neighborhood that didn't afford
the same opportunities as Salem.

507
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:22,529
The schools were underfunded,

508
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:25,863
the teachers, by and large,
didn't care as much, and...

509
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:30,284
Up until I was a sophomore in high school,
I never even dreamed of going to college.

510
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:33,699
I was shy and,
to a certain extent, lost.

511
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:37,541
We don't need your fucking
life story, just fucking resign!

512
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:45,177
We fucking trusted you,
and you betrayed that trust.

513
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,158
- We saw the pictures!
- We gonna stand here

514
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:49,201
- and listen to this man?
- I will not walk away from these students.

515
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,682
I will not resign!

516
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:51,808
What the fuck?

517
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,435
This piece of shit!

518
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:55,750
Just listen...

519
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,232
I will leave it to you,
my community.

520
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,984
My community of peers,
I leave it in your hands.

521
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:03,024
Lock him up!

522
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,800
Lock him up!

523
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:08,534
No matter how salacious
the details are,

524
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:14,954
I invite you to look at the
context of who I am as a person.

525
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:19,837
- Lock him up! Lock him up!
- I am not the monster that you think I am!

526
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,088
Lock him up!

527
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:25,592
Lock him up! Lock him up!

528
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,808
Mom!

529
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,810
Kid molester motherfucker!

530
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:46,856
There's no way
the hacker's a student, okay?

531
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:51,573
He's probably just some like 20-something,
disgruntled-ass loner IT dude

532
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:54,705
who jacks off to Fight Club in his
mom's basement like every night.

533
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,832
Oh, my God.
Brad Pitt's abs? I can't.

534
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,833
Why would he come
for Turrell?

535
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,619
Motive's irrelevant.

536
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:04,131
What's the motive behind
300 mass shootings every year?

537
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,508
There is none.

538
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:07,863
People just burn out,
want to take down their little universe.

539
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:10,550
I just had this scary thought
that, like...

540
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:14,926
we're all characters onThe Sims
and none of us know it.

541
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,477
Porn taught me
how to fuck.

542
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:18,979
But that's the problem.

543
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,060
You think it taught you
how to fuck...

544
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,350
It didn't.

545
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,549
This is why every guy I meet on Tinder
wants to choke me on our first date.

546
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:29,566
I learned how to eat
pussy by watching porn.

547
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:33,323
Just by looking in your eyes,

548
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,931
I can tell that you don't know the
first thing about eating pussy.

549
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,620
Whatever.
Guess you'll never know.

550
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:40,586
Tragic.

551
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,996
What about you, Mark?

552
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:46,465
- What?
- Like eating pussy?

553
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:49,877
Yeah.

554
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:51,549
Yeah, I do.

555
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,464
Is that true, Lil?

556
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:57,556
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

557
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,613
You are such a bitch.

558
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,200
I'm not a bitch. I'm a feminist.

559
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:19,639
Do you think it's cool
to be a slut?

560
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,085
Huh?

561
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:24,378
Keep going.

562
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:27,335
It's fucking obvious
that you said something to Bex.

563
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:28,675
Keep going.

564
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:32,136
I don't know about, like,
me going down on you.

565
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,921
Yeah, about the fact
that you haven't?

566
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:37,801
What, do you think it's cool
to fucking tell your friends?

567
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,515
Let me ask you something, Mark.

568
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:44,557
You think if I never went down on you,
you might mention it to Mason?

569
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:47,401
Matter of fact, I wouldn't.

570
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:50,299
I'd just bring it up to you. I'd be like,
"Hey, Lily, why don't you suck my dick?"

571
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:52,110
Hey, Mark,
why don't you eat my pussy?

572
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:54,491
Because I'm really fucking angry
at you right now.

573
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,615
How fucking convenient.

574
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:01,995
Mark was the first guy
I ever had sex with,

575
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,627
that I ever snuck out
of my house to meet,

576
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,921
that told me I was beautiful,

577
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:09,127
that I was smart.

578
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:10,586
Fuck you, Lily!

579
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,885
Fuck you.

580
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,407
- That he missed me.
- You think you're so fucking cool. Huh?

581
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,388
All the fucking time
in your little fucking skirt

582
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:18,661
and your little fucking panties.

583
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:20,551
That he wanted me.

584
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,873
Outside, dancing with Sarah,
with your tits out and your ass out,

585
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,559
you look fucking ridiculous.

586
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,769
That he loved me.

587
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:29,418
You think you're any different than
any fucking whore on Instagram?

588
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:33,401
Do you think anyone cares about
what the fuck you have to say?

589
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:37,193
He was the first guy who ever
made me feel good about being me.

590
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,158
You should have
some fucking self-respect.

591
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:45,534
And the first guy
that I ever wanted to hurt back.

592
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:57,930
Don't cry, don't cry.
I'm sorry, okay? Hey, you shouldn't cry.

593
00:41:58,391 --> 00:41:59,802
I'm a little drunk.

594
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,105
You're fucking beautiful
when you cry.

595
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:14,735
Hon, when are you
coming to bed?

596
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:16,591
In a bit.

597
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:19,295
I have some stuff to finish up.

598
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:22,510
Okay, well, uh,
just don't forget that

599
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,161
you have to take Carlie
to dance in the morning.

600
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:25,596
Oh, right, yeah.
Okay?

601
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:27,261
I'll come to bed soon.
Okay, love you.

602
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:30,643
Love you more.

603
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:54,917
We're gonna start
with tweets here

604
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:58,334
in which you used
the hashtag "we are legion."

605
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:03,464
That would seem to insinuate that you're
a member of the hacker group Anonymous.

606
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:06,054
No, I'm not.

607
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,639
No, I just... I'm a supporter.

608
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:11,309
A supporter? Why?

609
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:14,474
'Cause they're bad-ass.

610
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:17,315
And they can do shit that, like,
no offense, but the police...

611
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,900
police can't do.

612
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:22,361
Do you think this is a game?

613
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:25,949
Ruining peoples' lives,
do you get your kicks from this?

614
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,372
Look up at me
when I'm talking to you.

615
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,499
You know,
it just occurred to me...

616
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:33,998
You ought to be careful
going after this guy.

617
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:36,006
Why is that?

618
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:39,883
I'd think about whether or not
you have anything to hide.

619
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:41,755
Is that a threat?

620
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:43,800
It sure sounded like
a threat to me.

621
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:47,887
Look, I'm just playing this out
to its logical conclusion.

622
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:52,479
Your conclusion is
coming real soon.

623
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:59,235
Looks like half of Salem
just got hacked.

624
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:27,945
But how did it start?

625
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:31,282
I was babysitting for him.

626
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,953
And afterwards,
he'd always give me a ride home.

627
00:46:38,421 --> 00:46:43,166
The only guys that have ever been
into me were like dumb 16-year-olds.

628
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,967
In the car rides home, he'd...

629
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:51,344
ask me all these questions that
I've never been asked before.

630
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,809
And he'd listen to what I'd say.

631
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:58,059
And we never actually hooked up.

632
00:46:59,442 --> 00:47:01,479
There was one thing
that happened...

633
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:06,860
where he put his hand
on my thigh one time.

634
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:13,241
And I just melted.

635
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:17,703
Then I freaked out.

636
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:20,911
You know, 'cause of...

637
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:27,043
Carlie and Rose and just
seeing them all the time, and...

638
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:30,219
I quit babysitting.

639
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,849
Then one night he texted me.

640
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:38,558
And I wrote back.

641
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:42,891
But you're 18
and he's, like, 40.

642
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:48,314
I know,
but I really liked him, Bex.

643
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:51,446
He has kids.

644
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:56,955
- I'm not a bad person, Bex.
- I know, I know.

645
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,120
I love you.

646
00:48:02,088 --> 00:48:03,579
I love you, too.

647
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,126
No matter what.

648
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:09,963
No matter what.

649
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:39,948
Have a good day!

650
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:47,748
I read this quote from
this writer whose name I forget.

651
00:48:52,221 --> 00:48:53,587
But it said something like,

652
00:48:56,392 --> 00:48:58,930
ten percent
of the population is cruel.

653
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:07,980
And, like, ten percent
is merciful.

654
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:23,625
And the other 80% can be
swayed in either direction.

655
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:31,959
I'm also pretty sure that that writer
has never seen a WorldStar fight vid.

656
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:33,968
Or 4chan or Twitter.

657
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:43,478
Or had their best friend share their
nudes with her boyfriend, and in turn,

658
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:45,684
the entire fucking school.

659
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:47,440
Yeah, fuck Diamond.

660
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:49,245
I can't fucking believe
he sucked Bex's dick.

661
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:50,485
It's disgusting.

662
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:54,189
I'm still gagging.
I used to share drinks with that fucker.

663
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:57,280
But it is scary to think about.

664
00:49:58,579 --> 00:50:00,411
Because you don't know
who's who.

665
00:50:01,874 --> 00:50:04,082
Or how easily
they can be swayed.

666
00:50:06,462 --> 00:50:07,919
And at the end of the day,

667
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:11,547
nothing unites us
like a good tragedy.

668
00:50:14,303 --> 00:50:16,503
Did you hear when
he's coming back to school?

669
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:18,306
No.

670
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:21,675
I give him, like, five days
before he commits suicide.

671
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:24,806
I would.

672
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:30,809
And the worse it gets,

673
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:33,854
the more entertaining
it is for you,

674
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:37,282
this high school,

675
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:39,401
this bullshit town,

676
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,778
and the rest of the world.

677
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,071
Can I go to the bathroom?

678
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,706
He's being a little
fucking bitch.

679
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:47,454
We should do
something about that.

680
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:49,087
I'll drive.

681
00:50:52,508 --> 00:50:53,840
- I'm in.
- Come on, man.

682
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,170
I'm fucking in.

683
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:56,844
Me too.

684
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:59,554
- You in? Yeah?
- Let's fuckin' do it.

685
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:01,760
What about you?
You?

686
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:03,262
You fucking in?

687
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:04,892
You in?

688
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,665
How about you fucking pussies,
you in?

689
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:07,749
- Yeah!
- Teach Diamond a lesson?

690
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:08,934
Let's do it.

691
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:10,565
Hey, gentlemen.

692
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,521
What do they call us?

693
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:14,569
Slay 'em High Killas!

694
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:18,319
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
What do they... What do they call us?

695
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:19,927
Slay 'em High Killas!

696
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:21,409
What do they call us?

697
00:51:22,663 --> 00:51:24,655
What do they fucking call us?

698
00:51:25,124 --> 00:51:26,660
Slay 'em High Killas!

699
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:28,701
Fuck these pussies!
Fuck these faggots!

700
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:55,981
'Cause it's all
just a movie, right?

701
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:18,091
Hey, what's up?

702
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:20,426
Come here.
I want to ask you something.

703
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:22,639
What?

704
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:28,667
Do you have a birthmark
on your back?

705
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:31,805
- No.
- No?

706
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:34,607
You sure about that, Lily?

707
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:36,647
Yeah.

708
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:38,071
You're lying.

709
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:39,858
You're fucking lying.

710
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:41,616
Show me.

711
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:43,567
No.

712
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:09,138
What the fuck!

713
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,473
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Stop fighting.

714
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:13,333
- Get the fuck off of me!
- Stop fucking fighting, Lily.

715
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:15,144
What the fuck are you doing?

716
00:53:17,069 --> 00:53:18,229
I want to tell you something.

717
00:53:18,946 --> 00:53:21,905
When I looked through all the
photos in Nick Mathers' leak,

718
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:24,483
I started to think to myself,

719
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:28,282
"This girl looks
pretty fucking familiar."

720
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:30,072
Don't do this.

721
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:32,206
What do you think, Lily?

722
00:53:35,504 --> 00:53:36,504
Lily.

723
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,291
Look familiar?

724
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:41,048
- No.
- It doesn't, huh?

725
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:43,530
- Get off me.
- That's what I thought.

726
00:53:43,554 --> 00:53:46,137
I thought there's no fucking way
this could be Lily.

727
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:48,468
- My little Lily.
- Get the fuck off me.

728
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:50,884
I just wanna make sure.

729
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:57,728
So turn around,
be a nice little girl, and show me.

730
00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:00,651
Show me
you're telling the truth.

731
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:03,233
- Show it.
- Get the fuck off me.

732
00:54:04,158 --> 00:54:05,569
All right.

733
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:08,200
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

734
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:10,926
Hold her down, hold her down.

735
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:13,414
Oh, look. Hold it, hold it.

736
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:15,325
Yup, there it is!

737
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:17,543
Here.

738
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:21,123
Wow!

739
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:26,244
Turn her face around.
Let me get her face in the fucking shot.

740
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:28,967
Is it wrong that
I'm actually enjoying this?

741
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:31,599
Didn't you used to
fucking babysit his kids?

742
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:34,556
- Get off me. I don't know. Get off me!
- You listen to me.

743
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:37,222
Now you listen to me.
You fucking humiliated me.

744
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:39,812
Now it's my turn
to humiliate you.

745
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:43,854
I'm going to show the whole fucking
world what a dirty whore you are.

746
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:45,647
Stop fucking crying.

747
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:48,237
Stop fucking feeling sorry
for yourself.

748
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:50,284
There's gonna be no sympathy
for you.

749
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:52,195
You brought this
on your fucking self.

750
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,150
Let's get the fuck out of here.

751
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:08,507
The world's gonna know!

752
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:43,776
The weird thing is,
you don't know how many people have seen it.

753
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:46,791
You could have them saved
on your computer right now.

754
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:49,257
You can look them up
after I leave

755
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:52,092
and share them with
who-the-fuck-ever you want to.

756
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:56,639
My entire life,
every room that I walk into,

757
00:55:56,687 --> 00:56:00,146
every job interview
or first date,

758
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:03,562
I'll have that sinking feeling
in my stomach.

759
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:07,570
So I made a promise.

760
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:10,152
If I ever found out
who did this to me,

761
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,863
I would hurt them
as much as they hurt me.

762
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:15,369
Is that the right thing to do?

763
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:19,532
I don't know. Don't tell me
it's not justifiable.

764
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:22,418
It's not like
I fucking killed her.

765
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,553
Fuck me!

766
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:52,533
Lillian.

767
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:55,912
What?

768
00:56:56,705 --> 00:56:58,745
I can't... No, I'm sorry.
I can't do this right now.

769
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:01,624
Lily, come back here.

770
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:04,372
Lily?

771
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:08,130
I can't do it right now.

772
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:09,842
Lily?

773
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:11,216
Lillian.

774
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:17,140
Lily?

775
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:23,374
- I want to ask you a question, Lily.
- Let's not do this now...

776
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:26,106
I just want to talk to you.
I want to ask you a question.

777
00:57:26,652 --> 00:57:28,689
And I want you
to be honest with me.

778
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:31,215
- Lily. Lily, look at me.
- Jesus, please don't do this, please.

779
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:32,821
Lily, I just... I...

780
00:57:33,492 --> 00:57:35,154
I want to know the truth.

781
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:38,411
Is... Was that you in the photos
on Nick Mathers' phone?

782
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,643
- Lily, look at me. Lily? Look at me.
- Please, don't do this.

783
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:43,533
This is a simple question
I'm asking you.

784
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:45,577
I am begging you.
Don't do this.

785
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:48,417
Is that you
in those photos? Lily?

786
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:52,212
Lily, I just want
to know the truth.

787
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,217
Is this you?
Did you do this?

788
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:56,449
Stop, stop, stop.
Just stop. Please stop.

789
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:57,964
- Lily.
- Stop.

790
00:57:58,016 --> 00:57:59,882
I'm your mother. I...

791
00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:02,552
You... you are my daughter.
I have spent 18... Look at me.

792
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:04,846
I have spent 18 years
raising you.

793
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,685
I just want to know the truth.

794
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,941
- Is that you in those photos?
- Dad?

795
00:58:08,986 --> 00:58:10,818
Answer the question, Lily.

796
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:20,037
Yes.

797
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:22,873
Yes.

798
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:24,623
- It's you.
- Yes.

799
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:27,827
What is wrong with you?

800
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:31,251
What is wrong with you?

801
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:34,500
How could you do that?

802
00:58:34,553 --> 00:58:36,656
- Now get up. Get up.
- No, please don't make me do this.

803
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,512
Get up right now! Come on.

804
00:58:38,557 --> 00:58:39,798
- Lily?
- I don't want to go.

805
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:42,263
- I love you! I love you!
- No.

806
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:44,205
- Please, I'm so sorry. I love you!
- Get up. Stand up.

807
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:47,097
- No, Mom, I'm gonna get up. Please!
- Stand up! Go.

808
00:58:47,149 --> 00:58:49,186
Dad, please! Please, Dad!

809
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:51,817
- It's not possible.
- Please let me stay! Don't do this.

810
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:53,899
Don't do this,
don't do this, don't...

811
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:59,783
Mom, you've gotta let me in!

812
00:59:01,747 --> 00:59:03,579
Mom, please!

813
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:09,494
Please let me in! Please...

814
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:12,000
I'm sorry.

815
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,506
I'm so sorry.

816
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:32,187
Oh, no way.

817
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:34,068
That's Lily fucking Colson, dog.

818
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:35,569
Holy shit.

819
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:38,783
Yo!

820
00:59:39,451 --> 00:59:40,532
Big fan of your work.

821
00:59:41,495 --> 00:59:43,782
Salem's own little porn star.

822
00:59:45,624 --> 00:59:48,207
Check it out, we're on our way
home from work, look who we found.

823
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:52,169
Lily fucking Colson,
Salem's number one slut.

824
00:59:52,214 --> 00:59:54,547
- Say what's up, Lily!
- Leave me the fuck alone.

825
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:57,174
Say hi, baby. Say hi.

826
00:59:57,219 --> 00:59:59,447
- Can you blow us a kiss, Lily?
- Leave me the fuck alone.

827
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:02,075
I know she likes to use her mouth.
I don't know what the problem is.

828
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:04,160
- Leave me the fuck alone...
- Come on, Lily, blow us a kiss, baby.

829
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:06,767
Leave me the fuck alone.
Leave me the fuck alone.

830
01:00:06,812 --> 01:00:08,414
- What's that, bitch?
- Leave me the fuck alone.

831
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:09,554
Leave me the fuck alone.

832
01:00:10,065 --> 01:00:11,542
You think any man's
ever gonna wanna fuck

833
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:14,309
that nasty pussy of yours
after Googling you?

834
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:15,317
Your life is over.

835
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:16,523
You ought to just...

836
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,633
take what you can get
where you can get it.

837
01:00:18,657 --> 01:00:19,818
You know what I'm saying?

838
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:24,072
- So come on and get it, bitch.
- Fuck you.

839
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:26,454
Bitch, don't make me get out
of this fucking car.

840
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,582
What the fuck are you doing,
bitch?

841
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:34,337
We got them Salem bitches
on the motherfucking run!

842
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:37,207
Oh, Lily, we got you now, baby.

843
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:38,871
Dude, she's fast as hell.

844
01:00:41,263 --> 01:00:43,423
Where the fuck
you think you're going, Lily?

845
01:00:44,266 --> 01:00:47,304
Hey, the harder you make me work,
the harder I'm gonna make you hurt, bitch!

846
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:49,761
Stupid bitch.

847
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:19,127
So here's the thing
that really bothers me.

848
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:24,004
Who sees a naked photo of a girl
and their first thought is,

849
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:26,388
"Yo, I gotta kill this bitch"?

850
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:28,475
Turns out,

851
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:31,473
way more people
than you'd think.

852
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:38,050
And I know we're all, like,
a little desensitized to violence.

853
01:01:39,196 --> 01:01:40,312
And mobs.

854
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,984
And, like, violent mobs.

855
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:44,945
Were you sorry

856
01:01:44,993 --> 01:01:46,985
when my husband's dick was
in your fucking mouth?

857
01:01:47,329 --> 01:01:51,369
But when 17,000 people's
texts and emails get leaked...

858
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:52,782
Slay 'em High, motherfucker.

859
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:56,202
Slut! Slut! Slut! Slut!

860
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:59,372
...and the police and
FBI do nothing about it,

861
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:02,675
shit gets really fucking weird.

862
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:07,721
Here we come, Salem!

863
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:10,137
Can you hear me?

864
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:17,561
An act of terrorism has been
committed right here in our town.

865
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:19,350
Let's kill the fucker!

866
01:02:19,778 --> 01:02:24,648
And the police,
the government, the media

867
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:27,942
are either powerless
or complicit.

868
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:31,324
And the rest of the world
is laughing at us,

869
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:35,666
taking pleasure
in our humiliation.

870
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:38,418
That ends right now!

871
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:42,423
We will no longer be humiliated.

872
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:45,084
We will no longer be helpless.

873
01:02:45,136 --> 01:02:49,881
We will root out this terrorist
by any means necessary.

874
01:02:50,392 --> 01:02:54,477
If the government cannot
establish law and order,

875
01:02:54,521 --> 01:02:57,059
then believe me, we will.

876
01:02:57,524 --> 01:03:01,017
Take Salem back!
Take Salem back!

877
01:03:01,069 --> 01:03:04,187
Take Salem back!
Take Salem back!

878
01:03:30,849 --> 01:03:33,136
Marty? Marty, calm down.

879
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:35,471
- Calm down.
- I can't, I can't.

880
01:03:36,271 --> 01:03:40,561
All right. Marty,
we are just going to take the hood off, okay?

881
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:42,609
Here we go.

882
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:46,236
That's good. Good.

883
01:03:46,865 --> 01:03:49,403
Please don't hurt me. Please don't hurt me.

884
01:03:49,451 --> 01:03:50,658
Marty, Marty...

885
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:54,862
So we all saw when Chief Patterson's
information got leaked...

886
01:03:55,874 --> 01:03:58,833
We saw your police interview.
We read the transcript.

887
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:01,793
I mean, you basically
told 'em you did it.

888
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,500
No, no, I didn't.

889
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:05,540
- I didn't do it, I swear. I swear!
- Kid, no.

890
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:07,903
- Do you remember what I said?
- I was just fucking with them.

891
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:10,197
- I was just fucking with them!
- Marty, do you remember what I said?

892
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:11,382
Yes.

893
01:04:11,431 --> 01:04:13,093
- No... lies.
- No lies.

894
01:04:16,478 --> 01:04:18,845
We know that
you're behind this, Marty.

895
01:04:19,147 --> 01:04:20,147
We know it.

896
01:04:22,484 --> 01:04:23,565
I swear.

897
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:26,230
I swear, I didn't... I swear!

898
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:27,279
You didn't do it?

899
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:29,154
Well, somebody did it, Marty.

900
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:31,114
And if it wasn't you,
then who was it?

901
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:33,613
You need to give us a name.

902
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:35,277
Marty, who did it?

903
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:37,224
- I don't... I don't know. I don't know.
- Marty...

904
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:39,288
I don't know for sure,
but I think it's Lily Colson!

905
01:04:39,459 --> 01:04:40,540
Say that name again.

906
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:44,920
Lily Colson.

907
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:46,921
You don't know for sure?

908
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:51,085
No, no... I was monitoring data
traffic and I saw her IP address.

909
01:04:52,097 --> 01:04:53,929
Data was off the charts.
I swear, I swear.

910
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:56,090
I think... I... It's her, I swear.

911
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:59,097
- You better not be fucking with us, Marty.
- I'm not.

912
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:01,603
Let's get him cleaned up.

913
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:09,148
Okay.

914
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:11,697
My name is Marty Kolker.

915
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:14,116
And I can no longer
hold back the truth.

916
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:37,743
- Supervise the next round.
- Right.

917
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:40,680
I win?

918
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:44,643
You wear a dress on our date.

919
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:47,308
And if I win?
So do you.

920
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:33,938
When I grow up, I wanna be a director
and only make male rape revenge films.

921
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:36,448
Like Deliverance?
Ew, no. That's gross.

922
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:37,654
I want it to be sexy.

923
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:40,115
Like, if someone
remade Straw Dogs,

924
01:06:40,163 --> 01:06:42,516
but instead of Susan George getting raped,
Dustin Hoffman gets raped.

925
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:45,408
Why hasn't Nancy Meyers,
like, made that already?

926
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:47,292
If life were a movie,

927
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:49,750
this would be the obligatory
"girl shaves her head" scene.

928
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:51,459
Def.

929
01:06:51,508 --> 01:06:54,125
Actually, no, that would've happened,
like, last week.

930
01:06:54,177 --> 01:06:58,672
This would be, like, "girl burns this
motherfucking town to the ground" scene.

931
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:00,089
That would be dope.

932
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:02,466
Girl, I'm glad
this isn't a movie, though.

933
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:05,512
'Cause if it was,
you would definitely die at the end.

934
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:07,555
Why the fuck do I gotta die?

935
01:07:07,607 --> 01:07:10,002
'Cause the slut's gotta go, baby.
"'Cause the slut's gotta go."

936
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:10,891
Fuck you, guys.

937
01:07:10,944 --> 01:07:12,105
What the fuck?

938
01:07:13,071 --> 01:07:15,028
What?
Are you guys seeing this right now?

939
01:07:15,073 --> 01:07:17,565
What now?
Marty Kolker uploaded a video.

940
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:23,070
My name is Marty Kolker.

941
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:26,658
I'm not Erostratus.
This wasn't my idea.

942
01:07:27,377 --> 01:07:29,960
But after Mayor Bartlett's
information was leaked,

943
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:32,997
I started to monitor the
amount of data being uploaded

944
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:37,088
and downloaded from each IP
address in and around Salem.

945
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:39,545
There was one that stood out.

946
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:42,514
Lily Colson's.

947
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:48,266
I then confronted her about it at school.
What the fuck?

948
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:50,980
She not only admitted
to being behind the hack,

949
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:53,142
but she also said
that if I didn't help her...

950
01:07:54,988 --> 01:07:56,980
She said that
if I didn't help her,

951
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:58,425
she would release
all my personal information,

952
01:07:58,449 --> 01:07:59,860
as well as my father's.

953
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:02,363
I'm so sorry.

954
01:08:02,412 --> 01:08:05,120
I was scared. I didn't know
what else to do. I'm so sorry.

955
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:06,371
Why would he say that?

956
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,812
- No, this is fucked up.
- I don't even know how to do this.

957
01:08:09,836 --> 01:08:12,749
How can he just say that
without showing any proof

958
01:08:12,797 --> 01:08:14,900
- that that even happened?
- Did he just make that shit up?

959
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,777
Or is, like...
Is it really coming from your house?

960
01:08:16,801 --> 01:08:18,633
- Oh, shit.
- This isn't good.

961
01:08:18,678 --> 01:08:19,863
Everyone's tweeting about it.

962
01:08:19,887 --> 01:08:21,799
How many people
are gonna believe this?

963
01:08:21,848 --> 01:08:23,728
How many people are gonna
think that I did this?

964
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:25,591
Did Mom set the alarm, Sarah?

965
01:08:26,436 --> 01:08:27,802
Uh, I don't know.

966
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:29,678
I think I should go check.

967
01:08:42,869 --> 01:08:43,869
Did you set the alarm?

968
01:08:44,412 --> 01:08:45,528
I think so, why?

969
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:48,163
I feel anxious. I don't know.

970
01:08:49,042 --> 01:08:50,578
You... You want a Xanax?

971
01:08:51,169 --> 01:08:52,376
No.

972
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:14,306
Zone Four arming.

973
01:09:15,026 --> 01:09:16,062
Cannot arm.

974
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:18,189
Mom, what's Zone Four?

975
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:21,147
The glass sliding doors.

976
01:09:43,763 --> 01:09:46,096
Zone Four arming.

977
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:48,261
Arming.

978
01:09:49,143 --> 01:09:51,100
Zone Six cannot arm.

979
01:09:57,985 --> 01:09:58,985
Sarah?

980
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:02,946
Is everything okay?
Uh, no, not really.

981
01:10:03,282 --> 01:10:04,398
Well, can I help?

982
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:05,450
No, it's fine.

983
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:12,702
Bypass Zone Four.

984
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:13,750
Em?

985
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:16,035
Em?

986
01:10:21,259 --> 01:10:22,420
Quiet.

987
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:26,636
Zone Six arming

988
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:28,932
Arming.

989
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:31,683
Zone Six cannot arm.

990
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:12,220
I know your mom has guns here.
Where are they?

991
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:14,430
Where?

992
01:11:15,188 --> 01:11:16,395
Upstairs.

993
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:30,878
I know you both
hate me right now.

994
01:12:32,265 --> 01:12:35,508
And you probably just saw that video,
and you believe it.

995
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:39,645
That I really need you to know
that it's not true.

996
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:42,849
Because I wouldn't hurt people
like this.

997
01:12:44,402 --> 01:12:48,021
And because of everything that's happened,
I know you're not gonna to believe that.

998
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:53,325
But... I thought you should
hear it from me directly.

999
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:55,739
I didn't do this.

1000
01:12:57,039 --> 01:13:00,373
I... I wouldn't wish this
upon anyone.

1001
01:13:02,753 --> 01:13:08,374
And I know that I've made some mistakes,
but I'm... I'm not a bad person.

1002
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:16,719
I miss you a lot.
And I really just want to come home.

1003
01:13:35,286 --> 01:13:36,572
Mom!

1004
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:42,866
Mom!

1005
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:10,394
Mom, please! Mom!

1006
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:12,529
Mom!

1007
01:14:14,408 --> 01:14:16,775
Please, Mom!

1008
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:18,902
Mom!

1009
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:20,741
Mom!

1010
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:40,973
Mom!

1011
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:25,852
Mom!

1012
01:15:26,313 --> 01:15:28,646
Mommy...

1013
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:31,308
Mom!
Mommy!

1014
01:15:48,044 --> 01:15:49,205
Fuck!

1015
01:16:19,617 --> 01:16:20,698
Yeah!

1016
01:16:21,744 --> 01:16:22,951
This is it!

1017
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:34,417
Good people of Salem!

1018
01:16:34,757 --> 01:16:38,467
Good people of Salem,
did I not promise you justice?

1019
01:16:38,511 --> 01:16:40,628
Look at this! Look at this!

1020
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:45,140
Look at this! Bring her up.
Bring her over here. Look at her.

1021
01:16:45,184 --> 01:16:46,800
Look at her!

1022
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:48,269
Come on out.

1023
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:04,367
Look at these bitches!

1024
01:17:05,746 --> 01:17:08,659
Bring her here,
bring her here. Bring her to me.

1025
01:17:08,707 --> 01:17:10,699
You think you can fuck
our Salem?

1026
01:17:11,085 --> 01:17:13,919
What about you? Are you sorry?
Are you sorry?

1027
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:16,162
Are you sorry
for what you did to this town?

1028
01:17:17,675 --> 01:17:20,839
You're going down, do you hear me?
You hear me?

1029
01:17:23,139 --> 01:17:26,223
Traitors! Traitors! Traitors!

1030
01:17:26,267 --> 01:17:28,429
Traitors! Traitors!

1031
01:17:29,979 --> 01:17:33,848
Good people of Salem,
you know what these girls did.

1032
01:17:34,275 --> 01:17:36,688
You know how
they ruined our town.

1033
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:39,478
Are we gonna sit back
and let them get away with it?

1034
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:40,737
No!

1035
01:17:41,031 --> 01:17:43,023
Are we gonna take back our town?

1036
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:45,192
Yeah!
We're good people!

1037
01:17:45,703 --> 01:17:47,239
We're good people!

1038
01:17:47,997 --> 01:17:49,863
We're good people!

1039
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:52,032
We're not going anywhere, Lily.

1040
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:54,075
You can hide all you want.

1041
01:17:54,128 --> 01:17:56,745
But we're gonna
fucking find you, bitch.

1042
01:17:57,715 --> 01:18:00,378
We're gonna find you, bitch.

1043
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:02,759
Lily Colson!

1044
01:18:02,803 --> 01:18:04,260
Take Salem back!

1045
01:18:19,069 --> 01:18:21,857
Thank you, thank you,
thank you...

1046
01:18:22,907 --> 01:18:24,523
Quick.

1047
01:18:24,575 --> 01:18:25,782
We have to move.

1048
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:27,859
They can't see us here, okay?

1049
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:29,618
You can't be here.

1050
01:18:30,289 --> 01:18:31,289
Lily.

1051
01:18:31,332 --> 01:18:33,540
They killed Nance.

1052
01:18:33,584 --> 01:18:35,826
They killed Nance,
and they took Sarah and Em.

1053
01:18:37,046 --> 01:18:39,286
And they're gonna come for me!
Everything's gonna be okay.

1054
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:41,255
Okay? Let's go upstairs.

1055
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:42,666
I can't move.
Come here. Up.

1056
01:18:44,094 --> 01:18:46,882
Come here, come here.

1057
01:18:59,818 --> 01:19:01,059
Take a deep breath.

1058
01:19:04,198 --> 01:19:05,359
I'll be right back.

1059
01:19:29,807 --> 01:19:30,807
Get him!

1060
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:34,058
Help! Help!

1061
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:49,316
Hi, hey.

1062
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:57,996
You're okay. They probably just
took them to the police station.

1063
01:20:00,254 --> 01:20:02,416
We're gonna help, okay?
I promise.

1064
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:05,040
I'm so scared.
I know.

1065
01:20:05,092 --> 01:20:08,256
The whole fucking world
has lost its mind.

1066
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:16,927
I don't know...

1067
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:20,351
Lily...
It's okay. I can do it.

1068
01:20:20,399 --> 01:20:22,061
Lily, Lily.
I can do it.

1069
01:20:23,902 --> 01:20:25,609
It is gonna be okay.

1070
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:29,276
You are safe now.

1071
01:20:33,412 --> 01:20:34,778
I'll take care of you.

1072
01:20:37,207 --> 01:20:38,573
I will protect you.

1073
01:20:42,171 --> 01:20:43,457
God, you're beautiful.

1074
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:47,675
Kiss me.

1075
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:54,013
You fell in love with me.

1076
01:20:55,184 --> 01:20:56,766
Did you think
I was in love with you?

1077
01:20:58,395 --> 01:20:59,476
That's why you did this.

1078
01:21:02,733 --> 01:21:06,898
I would never
ever do something like this.

1079
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:15,111
Tell the fucking truth.

1080
01:21:21,418 --> 01:21:24,411
All this pain and chaos, Lily...

1081
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:30,254
And I
never even got to fuck you.

1082
01:21:35,516 --> 01:21:37,599
No, no, no, no...

1083
01:21:37,976 --> 01:21:38,976
Kiss me.

1084
01:21:41,188 --> 01:21:43,430
Please...
Kiss. Me.

1085
01:21:44,441 --> 01:21:45,727
Don't hurt me.

1086
01:21:54,284 --> 01:21:55,900
First, we're gonna kill you.

1087
01:21:57,246 --> 01:21:58,703
Then the Lacey sisters.

1088
01:22:01,125 --> 01:22:02,125
And then...

1089
01:22:02,835 --> 01:22:05,122
we're gonna kill
that slut Lily Colson.

1090
01:22:10,467 --> 01:22:12,959
Hey, pussy. Get over here.
Tie her up, let's go.

1091
01:22:30,696 --> 01:22:32,403
I'm so sorry, Bex.

1092
01:22:33,323 --> 01:22:34,323
No...

1093
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:38,530
No, no, no, no...

1094
01:22:41,999 --> 01:22:44,082
Please don't do this...

1095
01:22:44,126 --> 01:22:45,367
I don't have a choice.

1096
01:22:45,752 --> 01:22:47,209
I'm begging you.

1097
01:22:48,255 --> 01:22:50,747
This isn't you.
You're not like this.

1098
01:22:56,847 --> 01:22:58,634
Please don't do this.

1099
01:23:05,939 --> 01:23:07,555
You want to kiss me, Daddy?

1100
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:10,610
Yes.

1101
01:23:12,738 --> 01:23:14,604
You want to touch me, Daddy?

1102
01:23:15,407 --> 01:23:16,488
Yes.

1103
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:21,452
You want to fuck me, Daddy?

1104
01:23:23,081 --> 01:23:24,081
Yes.

1105
01:23:27,586 --> 01:23:29,578
You promise to be gentle?

1106
01:23:33,217 --> 01:23:34,217
I promise.

1107
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:03,037
Bitch!

1108
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:07,157
Damn it, Lily!
I wasn't gonna hurt you.

1109
01:24:07,209 --> 01:24:08,916
Open the fucking door, Lily!

1110
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:19,093
Lily, it was a fucking mistake.
Open the fucking door.

1111
01:24:19,805 --> 01:24:21,467
Open the fucking door, Lily!

1112
01:24:22,391 --> 01:24:23,632
Open the door.

1113
01:24:25,852 --> 01:24:28,686
It is not what it looks like,
Lily. I didn't kill him.

1114
01:24:29,022 --> 01:24:31,435
What the fuck are you doing?
Open it up.

1115
01:24:32,401 --> 01:24:34,188
Open the fucking door, Lily.

1116
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:38,400
Goddammit, Lily,
I wasn't gonna hurt you.

1117
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:41,866
I have lost everything, okay?
I have nothing.

1118
01:24:42,578 --> 01:24:45,161
Open the door right now
or I'm leaving.

1119
01:24:45,205 --> 01:24:48,243
I need you to open the door
right fucking now!

1120
01:24:48,667 --> 01:24:49,748
Right now!

1121
01:24:51,878 --> 01:24:54,712
Open this fucking door,
you little shit.

1122
01:24:57,926 --> 01:24:59,542
Open the fucking door!

1123
01:26:03,659 --> 01:26:04,866
I'm so scared.

1124
01:26:07,037 --> 01:26:08,699
I don't want to die here.

1125
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:11,121
This isn't you, Diamond.

1126
01:26:20,967 --> 01:26:22,208
I'm not gonna do it.

1127
01:26:22,511 --> 01:26:23,672
I'm not gonna tie her up.

1128
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:24,961
The fuck is wrong with you?

1129
01:26:26,139 --> 01:26:28,677
Look at your life.
She... She ruined it.

1130
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:30,637
She humiliated you.

1131
01:26:40,153 --> 01:26:41,153
No.

1132
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:43,901
She didn't humiliate me.
You did.

1133
01:26:52,582 --> 01:26:53,447
Tie her up.

1134
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:55,492
No. Fuck you.

1135
01:26:57,629 --> 01:26:58,995
You're not a hero,
Diamond.

1136
01:27:04,636 --> 01:27:06,298
One of you motherfuckers
grab him.

1137
01:27:06,346 --> 01:27:08,116
Bring him out in the street.
Let's hang this bitch.

1138
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:10,678
Let's get this show
on the fucking road, boys!

1139
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:51,064
Patriotic citizens.

1140
01:27:52,058 --> 01:27:54,050
Anybody with information

1141
01:27:54,978 --> 01:27:58,722
leading to the whereabouts
or capture of Lily Colson...

1142
01:28:00,525 --> 01:28:04,565
will not only be looked upon as a
hero amongst the good people of Salem

1143
01:28:04,988 --> 01:28:07,230
but will be
most handsomely rewarded.

1144
01:28:23,924 --> 01:28:25,085
What the fuck?

1145
01:28:29,262 --> 01:28:32,300
Beware, we're gonna find you.

1146
01:28:33,391 --> 01:28:35,223
It's not just me looking.

1147
01:28:35,268 --> 01:28:38,432
It's the town. It's the FBI.

1148
01:28:38,814 --> 01:28:40,350
So you best do the right thing.

1149
01:28:40,398 --> 01:28:42,230
Make it easy on yourself.

1150
01:28:47,364 --> 01:28:49,401
I'm telling you.
She didn't fucking do this.

1151
01:28:49,908 --> 01:28:51,444
You tell that to the FBI.

1152
01:28:52,702 --> 01:28:54,193
They confirmed Marty's story

1153
01:28:54,246 --> 01:28:56,738
about the amount of data
that Lily was uploading.

1154
01:28:57,749 --> 01:28:59,490
Then why aren't they here?

1155
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:14,467
Who the fuck is that?

1156
01:29:19,896 --> 01:29:21,432
Lily, he's gonna kill you!

1157
01:29:29,573 --> 01:29:31,854
You sure you even know how to
hold that thing, little girl?

1158
01:29:39,332 --> 01:29:41,052
What are you gonna do?
You gonna kill a cop?

1159
01:29:41,585 --> 01:29:42,826
Lily!

1160
01:29:44,129 --> 01:29:45,449
You aren't allowed
to shoot a cop.

1161
01:29:59,603 --> 01:30:01,060
Em! Sarah!

1162
01:30:03,607 --> 01:30:04,893
Lily...

1163
01:30:04,941 --> 01:30:06,273
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1164
01:30:06,318 --> 01:30:07,900
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

1165
01:30:07,944 --> 01:30:10,311
- I love you.
- Are you okay? I love you.

1166
01:30:10,363 --> 01:30:12,150
I love you both so much.

1167
01:30:13,617 --> 01:30:16,451
They killed her.
They fucking killed Nance.

1168
01:30:17,162 --> 01:30:18,698
Where's Bex?

1169
01:30:18,747 --> 01:30:20,099
Let's fucking go!

1170
01:30:22,959 --> 01:30:24,825
Sarah!

1171
01:30:28,757 --> 01:30:31,420
Let's go!
Slay 'em High, motherfuckers!

1172
01:30:39,017 --> 01:30:40,849
Why?

1173
01:30:51,571 --> 01:30:54,439
Film this shit.
We gotta show everybody.

1174
01:30:54,491 --> 01:30:56,949
- Yeah!
- Spin those tires.

1175
01:30:56,993 --> 01:30:59,485
Slay 'em High,
all right, boys?

1176
01:30:59,537 --> 01:31:03,121
Don't fuck around! Finish it!
Keep going!

1177
01:31:44,874 --> 01:31:46,365
Dude, they're fucking crazy.

1178
01:31:56,636 --> 01:31:58,423
I'm gonna take
these bitches out.

1179
01:32:06,146 --> 01:32:08,103
Fuck this! Fuck!

1180
01:32:30,754 --> 01:32:33,462
If you wanna surrender,
we'll stop shooting.

1181
01:32:35,508 --> 01:32:36,508
Fuck you, cunts!

1182
01:32:50,148 --> 01:32:51,148
You're good?

1183
01:32:52,108 --> 01:32:53,895
Yeah.
Fuck!

1184
01:32:59,991 --> 01:33:01,198
Fuck.

1185
01:33:11,169 --> 01:33:12,580
Son of a bitch.

1186
01:33:15,090 --> 01:33:16,090
Okay.

1187
01:33:17,133 --> 01:33:19,591
Okay, all right,
I-I surrender. Don't shoot!

1188
01:33:22,222 --> 01:33:23,338
Don't shoot, please.

1189
01:33:24,015 --> 01:33:25,222
Get on your knees.

1190
01:33:26,684 --> 01:33:29,222
- Get on your fucking knees!
- Okay.

1191
01:33:35,401 --> 01:33:36,608
Don't kill me, please.

1192
01:33:38,530 --> 01:33:39,530
I...

1193
01:33:40,198 --> 01:33:41,439
Pl-Please don't kill me.

1194
01:33:47,789 --> 01:33:50,372
Bex, I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry, please.

1195
01:33:51,751 --> 01:33:53,367
Please don't kill me.

1196
01:33:54,838 --> 01:33:56,625
All right, I didn't...
I didn't mean it.

1197
01:33:57,090 --> 01:34:00,629
God, please, Bex. Please, I'm begging you.
Don't fucking kill me.

1198
01:34:02,971 --> 01:34:04,758
Please!

1199
01:34:05,181 --> 01:34:07,423
Look... Look, it was fucking stupid,
all right? I know.

1200
01:34:07,976 --> 01:34:10,162
All right? I'm sorry for everything.
I regret everything.

1201
01:34:10,186 --> 01:34:12,769
I got carried away. I'm sorry.
Please don't fucking kill me.

1202
01:34:15,108 --> 01:34:16,519
Please.

1203
01:34:17,235 --> 01:34:18,521
Hey.

1204
01:34:19,737 --> 01:34:21,444
Please don't fucking kill me.

1205
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:32,666
Let's go.

1206
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:46,424
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

1207
01:34:50,268 --> 01:34:51,634
You okay?
Uh, yeah.

1208
01:34:52,854 --> 01:34:54,470
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1209
01:34:56,357 --> 01:35:00,317
Thanks for not murdering me,
I guess.

1210
01:35:00,361 --> 01:35:01,647
You're welcome.

1211
01:35:03,781 --> 01:35:04,781
You should go.

1212
01:35:05,742 --> 01:35:06,482
Yeah.

1213
01:35:06,534 --> 01:35:08,321
Yeah, I should.
Yeah.

1214
01:35:08,369 --> 01:35:09,450
Okay.

1215
01:35:20,131 --> 01:35:21,247
I mean, uh...

1216
01:35:21,883 --> 01:35:22,883
Not all men.

1217
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:29,138
I don't know what
I'd do without you guys.

1218
01:35:32,227 --> 01:35:35,766
My name is Lily Colson.
I'm 18 years old.

1219
01:35:36,231 --> 01:35:39,599
And I don't know if me and my friends
are gonna live through the night.

1220
01:35:42,237 --> 01:35:44,604
This entire fucking town
wants to kill us.

1221
01:35:46,115 --> 01:35:49,654
And they may say that it's because
they thought I was behind it

1222
01:35:50,078 --> 01:35:51,285
or that I'm a whore,

1223
01:35:51,329 --> 01:35:52,695
I'm immoral, I'm a homewrecker,

1224
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:54,704
I deserve it, I have it coming.

1225
01:35:55,208 --> 01:35:57,746
Well, guess what?
I didn't hack anybody's shit.

1226
01:35:57,794 --> 01:35:59,831
I didn't do it.
And I don't know who did.

1227
01:36:01,005 --> 01:36:02,871
As for being a whore,

1228
01:36:03,299 --> 01:36:05,211
a homewrecker, immoral?

1229
01:36:05,260 --> 01:36:06,421
Sure.

1230
01:36:08,429 --> 01:36:10,921
It doesn't hold a fucking candle
to your righteousness.

1231
01:36:11,599 --> 01:36:13,056
That's the real sickness here,

1232
01:36:13,101 --> 01:36:15,263
your righteousness
and hypocrisy.

1233
01:36:16,104 --> 01:36:20,348
It's the simple fact that you
can't live by the rules you set,

1234
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,107
yet you still pretend.

1235
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:25,227
This is your world.
You built this.

1236
01:36:25,863 --> 01:36:28,571
If it's too strict,
tear it the fuck down.

1237
01:36:29,659 --> 01:36:30,945
But don't look at me.

1238
01:36:32,161 --> 01:36:34,744
Don't take your hate out on me.
I just got here.

1239
01:36:38,001 --> 01:36:40,789
And I have no clue where to go,

1240
01:36:40,837 --> 01:36:44,706
because from the moment I arrived,
all I was ever given were orders.

1241
01:36:46,092 --> 01:36:47,048
Smile.

1242
01:36:47,093 --> 01:36:48,004
Open up.

1243
01:36:48,052 --> 01:36:49,839
Cross your legs.

1244
01:36:49,887 --> 01:36:50,990
Spread your pussy.

1245
01:36:51,014 --> 01:36:52,050
Speak softer.

1246
01:36:52,098 --> 01:36:53,009
Scream louder.

1247
01:36:53,057 --> 01:36:54,264
Be quiet.

1248
01:36:54,309 --> 01:36:55,390
Be confident.

1249
01:36:55,435 --> 01:36:56,551
Be interesting.

1250
01:36:56,602 --> 01:36:58,013
Don't be so difficult.

1251
01:36:58,062 --> 01:36:59,182
Be strong.

1252
01:37:00,273 --> 01:37:02,230
Be an angel. Be a whore.

1253
01:37:02,275 --> 01:37:03,356
Be a princess.

1254
01:37:03,401 --> 01:37:05,768
Be anything you want to be.

1255
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:09,313
Even the President of the
United States of America.

1256
01:37:11,159 --> 01:37:12,159
Just kidding.

1257
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:15,281
Fuck you.

1258
01:37:16,706 --> 01:37:18,288
You still want to kill me?

1259
01:37:19,083 --> 01:37:20,083
Rape me?

1260
01:37:20,543 --> 01:37:21,624
Stab me?

1261
01:37:21,669 --> 01:37:22,705
Shoot me?

1262
01:37:23,671 --> 01:37:24,707
Let's go.

1263
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:27,547
Rally your fucking crew.

1264
01:37:28,092 --> 01:37:32,302
Grab your guns
and hide behind your masks.

1265
01:37:34,265 --> 01:37:36,427
You want to do this
in real life now?

1266
01:37:38,478 --> 01:37:39,935
Give it your best shot.

1267
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:46,024
'Cause you've prepared me
my whole life for this.

1268
01:37:48,613 --> 01:37:49,820
You may kill me.

1269
01:37:50,656 --> 01:37:52,522
But you can't kill us all.

1270
01:38:43,501 --> 01:38:47,586
The charges include cyberterrorism,
murder, invasion of privacy.

1271
01:38:48,339 --> 01:38:51,082
A life sentence
is an absolute certainty.

1272
01:38:52,385 --> 01:38:53,592
Jesus.

1273
01:38:54,262 --> 01:38:55,262
Come with me.

1274
01:39:02,895 --> 01:39:04,102
I just...

1275
01:39:04,147 --> 01:39:06,230
I don't understand,
you know,

1276
01:39:06,858 --> 01:39:08,645
why you would
do something like this.

1277
01:39:10,570 --> 01:39:12,106
People's lives
were ruined.

1278
01:39:13,406 --> 01:39:15,022
People lost their lives.

1279
01:39:17,493 --> 01:39:19,029
Your sister almost killed.

1280
01:39:20,371 --> 01:39:21,907
Well, why would you...

1281
01:39:22,832 --> 01:39:24,448
Why would you
do something like this?

1282
01:39:28,087 --> 01:39:29,168
I don't know.

1283
01:39:31,299 --> 01:39:32,299
For the lulz.
