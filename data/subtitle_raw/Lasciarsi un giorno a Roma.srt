00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,307
CHAPTER ONE: ABBRACCIO

2
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,077
THE MEANING OF THE WORD "HUG" -
WRAP YOUR ARMS AROUND SOMEONE

3
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,034
EXAMPLE: NEED A HUG

4
00:02:02,628 --> 00:02:04,727
OR: UNION WITH THEM,
WHO WILL LEAD YOU TO RUIN

5
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:06,770
EXAMPLE: DEATH GRIP

6
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:19,485
TWO MONTHS EARLIER

7
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,080
Thank you!

8
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,710
- Well, how many?
- About 30.

9
00:02:35,645 --> 00:02:38,187
- Next time, 15.
- But it was almost 300!

10
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,237
Oh, shit!

11
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,937
Love Seacret magazine prints out
in two days, and I need the answers tomorrow.

12
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,242
Why did I say yes?

13
00:02:45,325 --> 00:02:47,097
Actually, since you've been on it,

14
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,940
"You can't tell your heart to do what you want."
the most fashionable column ever!

15
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,217
Everyone needs Gabriel Garcia Marquez's advice.

16
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,097
You should read his books
and look for answers in them,

17
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,917
not a magazine article.

18
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,027
Come on.

19
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,637
Why do you want printouts
and not an e-mail?

20
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,457
There's only three of us
who know I'm doing this column.

21
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,437
But it won't be for long, hopefully.

22
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,582
- All right, I'll see you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

23
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:28,110
ROMAN BREAKUPS

24
00:04:28,342 --> 00:04:29,947
- Good evening!
- Good evening.

25
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,197
Franco!

26
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,767
I'll leave my bike here?

27
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,297
- Yeah, leave it, I'll put it away later.
- Uh, okay.

28
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,117
What a nice young man!

29
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,297
Do you live here?

30
00:04:39,508 --> 00:04:41,617
Signora, I'm Tommaso.

31
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,377
Tommaso Rosso, entrance B, apartment 8.

32
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,397
B, apartment 8...

33
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,917
What a coincidence! Look who's here!

34
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,505
Former tenant from apartment 8-B,

35
00:04:51,588 --> 00:04:53,097
Spanish!

36
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,920
- Good evening, ma'am!
- Good evening, my dear.

37
00:04:56,502 --> 00:04:57,588
Nice to meet you, Tommaso.

38
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,537
Zoé.

39
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,874
Did you know that you both lived
in the same apartment?

40
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,287
What sign are you?

41
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,370
- Taurus.
- Taurus.

42
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,917
That's a great sign!

43
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,568
- Both of you.
- Mom, leave people alone!

44
00:05:14,651 --> 00:05:15,497
Uh, excuse me.

45
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,154
- Okay, Franco, it's nothing.
- Bye.

46
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,651
- You speak Italian?
- A little.

47
00:05:23,245 --> 00:05:25,440
- You speak Spanish?
- A little.

48
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,737
You're back from vacation?

49
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,379
I was on a business trip.

50
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:31,657
Three weeks in Tokyo.

51
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,597
Tokyo?

52
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,327
I love Tokyo.

53
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:37,207
I have a collection of... What are they called?

54
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,227
Comic books, Japanese manga.

55
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,560
Really? I love them.

56
00:05:43,565 --> 00:05:44,834
Do you want to see them?

57
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,622
Just like that, huh?

58
00:05:50,548 --> 00:05:51,702
Can you show me the way?

59
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,920
Thank you.

60
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,331
It's a beautiful house!

61
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,567
It's marvelous!

62
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,650
Thank you.

63
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,667
So it's really a comic book story?

64
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,147
You thought it was an excuse?

65
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,230
I don't know.

66
00:06:12,182 --> 00:06:13,965
Sorry, it's a little messy.

67
00:06:14,548 --> 00:06:15,548
It's okay.

68
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,947
Would you like something to drink?

69
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,030
I don't mind.

70
00:06:24,822 --> 00:06:26,125
Who is this woman?

71
00:06:30,537 --> 00:06:31,622
That's my wife.

72
00:06:33,302 --> 00:06:34,331
Is that a problem?

73
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,302
Not at all.

74
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,277
- No?
- No.

75
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,360
No?

76
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:44,850
No?

77
00:06:51,851 --> 00:06:52,851
Welcome back!

78
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,507
Shall we celebrate?

79
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,157
What are we celebrating, Tom?

80
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,317
My flight?

81
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,637
I'm a wreck.

82
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,257
Let's celebrate your return for now,

83
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,391
and I found some great apartments,
that you should check out,

84
00:07:03,474 --> 00:07:05,537
so you can stop spending a lot of money,

85
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,237
to rent your "marvelous" house.

86
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,107
What did you decide about the novel?

87
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,357
If they want to print it,
the ending will be what it is.

88
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,847
The only reason I'm not giving up
because the last book didn't work out.

89
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,357
I know you don't agree.

90
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,227
If that's what you decide,

91
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,847
I guess you're sure.

92
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:19,930
I guess so.

93
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,110
White or red?

94
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,807
It's up to you.

95
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,422
Uh, no, I don't care.

96
00:07:26,742 --> 00:07:27,742
White.

97
00:07:28,331 --> 00:07:32,137
I'm saying how is it possible
to end an epic couple story

98
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,577
with such romantic nonsense?

99
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,687
This fic idea, what with the happy ending.

100
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,167
books sell better...

101
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,620
I think it's funny.

102
00:07:40,331 --> 00:07:41,331
No?

103
00:08:06,342 --> 00:08:08,537
Giuseppe, I won't change the ending,

104
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,250
you don't have to insist, no,
I'm not gonna change the ending.

105
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,425
I get it, I know "Blue Carpet" didn't work,
I've heard that one,

106
00:08:15,508 --> 00:08:17,157
it's not because he's sad.

107
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,662
Okay? So, uh.

108
00:08:19,485 --> 00:08:21,937
Look, there's no point in insisting
the finale stays as it is.

109
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,365
You know the terms,
and if you hear anything, you call me.

110
00:08:25,074 --> 00:08:26,074
Bye.

111
00:08:27,794 --> 00:08:29,668
Maybe you should give up.

112
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,590
Good morning.

113
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,397
Listen, while you were in Tokyo,

114
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,277
I saw that there are some great apartments for sale
some great apartments for us.

115
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,520
- They're smaller, but, uh.
- I'm sorry.

116
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,227
Mr. Takeshi?

117
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,074
- Zoya!
- "Yes." I'm gone.

118
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,459
- Good morning, Nina.
- Welcome back, Zoya.

119
00:08:57,542 --> 00:08:58,968
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks, and you?

120
00:08:59,051 --> 00:08:59,905
All right. Uh-huh.

121
00:08:59,988 --> 00:09:01,957
A report on the demo of Global Hunters.

122
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,907
Thank you.

123
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,230
Compared to last week,

124
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,131
only six percent of the players
were able to complete the level.

125
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,594
That's good news, isn't it?

126
00:09:13,314 --> 00:09:14,357
Is that good news?

127
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,777
Last week it was ten percent.

128
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,525
Come with me, Nina.

129
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,542
Hey, everybody! How's it going?

130
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,140
Hello.

131
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,377
Does anyone know why, in 1978.

132
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,467
100 yen coins disappeared in Japan?

133
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:31,280
And the government had to
to mint four times as many?

134
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,277
No?

135
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,360
No one?

136
00:09:37,325 --> 00:09:38,560
"Space Invaders."

137
00:09:39,154 --> 00:09:42,477
The 100 yen coin was needed
for the "Space Invaders" game,

138
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,477
the most massive game in history.

139
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,947
Everyone played it:

140
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,062
children,

141
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,657
adults, the whole family.

142
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,047
Losing our heads to get there

143
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:54,125
until the last, fastest.
and invincible alien.

144
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,371
And everyone wanted a 100 yen coin,
to beat him,

145
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:58,867
all of them.

146
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,805
But only three percent were able to do so.

147
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,747
Three, Nina, not six.

148
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,577
It's 100 yen, my souvenir from Tokyo.

149
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,754
May he help you, good job.

150
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,627
15 more.

151
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,997
I haven't even looked at the others.

152
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,222
Well, you read it.

153
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,337
"Sunbeam 48: Hey, Marquez.

154
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,507
I have known orgasm, but not with my husband."

155
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,590
No.

156
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,277
"I hate her.

157
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,527
I don't just want to leave her,
I want her to suffer,

158
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,619
hooked on psychotropic drugs.

159
00:10:31,702 --> 00:10:32,747
Or worse:

160
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,374
let her have cellulite."

161
00:10:34,457 --> 00:10:36,145
- Advice?
- No, no, none.

162
00:10:36,228 --> 00:10:37,228
No.

163
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,817
"I'm 38, have a young son.

164
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,347
I want a divorce.

165
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:44,017
I don't care about the theories
that love changes shape.

166
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,647
- I want to fuck."
- Here.

167
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,290
- "And not just at Christmas."
- Of course it is.

168
00:10:48,274 --> 00:10:49,631
I can't watch this.

169
00:10:49,714 --> 00:10:51,057
"Andre88:

170
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:54,247
"Hey, my girlfriend's always
shoving socks in my mouth..."

171
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,330
Fuck it!

172
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,080
There are boundaries.

173
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,967
"We've been married for almost 40 years,

174
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:03,217
and 14 of them are trying to get a divorce.

175
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,207
But at the end of the day, we're still together."

176
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,305
How do you see it?

177
00:11:06,388 --> 00:11:07,551
How do I see it?

178
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:09,257
You should see a psychoanalyst for treatment,

179
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,074
instead of writing in a journal.

180
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,680
Give it to me.

181
00:11:14,937 --> 00:11:17,357
"Hey Marquez, life tyrannizes and hurts..."

182
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,514
Oh, my God!

183
00:11:19,371 --> 00:11:21,611
"Hi Marquez, my girlfriend..."

184
00:11:22,685 --> 00:11:25,268
This, in general, could be ....

185
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,977
"Hey Marquez, I don't..."

186
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,037
CHAPTER TWO: FINE

187
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,557
THE MEANING OF THE WORD "END" IS
FINAL PART OF SOMETHING

188
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,200
EXAMPLE: WORK IN PROGRESS

189
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,488
OR: COMPLETION OF SOMETHING

190
00:11:58,571 --> 00:11:59,980
EXAMPLE: THE END HAS COME

191
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,880
Hey, Marquez,

192
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,470
I'm not Italian.

193
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:07,357
I'm 35 years old, I have a great
job and an Italian man.

194
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,257
We met in Rome.

195
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,417
My sister came here
on a student exchange

196
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,928
and ended up living here.

197
00:12:14,011 --> 00:12:16,610
And when I could, I decided to come to her.

198
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:19,177
I didn't think I'd stay long,

199
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,577
but I've been living with him for almost ten years.

200
00:12:22,422 --> 00:12:25,367
But as of late, I've been having a crisis.

201
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:28,467
And after 40 days,
we've been at home together,

202
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:31,087
I'm not sure how I feel anymore.

203
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,731
and I don't know what to do.

204
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:34,857
I don't know if I love him anymore,

205
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:38,788
and I can't figure out if it's
affection, friendship, or something else?

206
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:42,217
I've always dumped all my loved ones on my own

207
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,725
and I've seen them suffer.

208
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,194
And I don't want him to suffer either.

209
00:12:47,028 --> 00:12:48,251
I'm confused.

210
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,188
How do I know how I feel about him?

211
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:54,727
On the 27th, we'll be ten years together,

212
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,994
and I need to decide that sooner.

213
00:12:58,594 --> 00:12:59,967
- Zoya.
- Hey, Tom.

214
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,507
I'm gonna be late at the office.

215
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,227
I won't be able to stop by the house.

216
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:05,287
I'll see you right at Nello's, okay?

217
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,370
All right. Uh-huh.

218
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,040
Is everything okay?

219
00:13:09,097 --> 00:13:10,651
Yeah, yeah...

220
00:13:11,188 --> 00:13:12,188
Oh, that's great.

221
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,862
- I'll see you later.
- Okay, bye.

222
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,637
Omar?

223
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,777
- Is that wine again?
- Okay, it's for her.

224
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,877
For God's sake!

225
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,527
A little bit, please!

226
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,317
Are we having a vacation here?

227
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,057
Gianni and Simone are in the lead this time,

228
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,367
they have 224 points.

229
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,339
- Well done, my love!
- Sweetie.

230
00:13:36,422 --> 00:13:38,197
You're unbearable!

231
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,122
Only you will awaken in me
homophobic instinct!

232
00:13:40,205 --> 00:13:41,205
Daddy!

233
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,327
He's right.

234
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:45,937
In my country, you wouldn't even be allowed
you wouldn't even be allowed in a restaurant like this.

235
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,467
You don't have restaurants like that in your country, nigger.

236
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,688
You can't say "nigger."

237
00:13:49,771 --> 00:13:52,537
No, he's allowed,
because he's a half-nigger himself.

238
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,557
Well, half a negro...

239
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,917
I'm beige, to be sure!

240
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,105
Even though they haven't won anything
in the last five years,

241
00:13:59,188 --> 00:14:01,707
Tommaso and Zoya when she gets here,

242
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,760
came in a respectable second place.

243
00:14:04,285 --> 00:14:05,307
I'm sorry...

244
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,927
- Ah, there she is!
- It's finally here!

245
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,257
- How did you get here?
- It's about time!

246
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,407
And in third place.
is me and my princess,

247
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,847
but with an excellent prospect
of going up, right, honey?

248
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,777
I'm not a princess.

249
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,717
Me and my... chef.

250
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,614
Then, I'm not yours, I'm mine.

251
00:14:20,697 --> 00:14:21,987
Bravo, Viola!

252
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:22,987
Rebel!

253
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,731
How do you say "explotación infantil"?

254
00:14:25,382 --> 00:14:27,071
- "Exploitation of minors."
- Exactly.

255
00:14:27,154 --> 00:14:29,277
It's not exploitation, it's tax avoidance.

256
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,537
He's paying, but in black cash.

257
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,977
And then there's everyone else on the list,

258
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,347
like Omar and Valerie,

259
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:37,767
they used to walk side by side,

260
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,887
but this year has been disappointing.

261
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,887
The Senegalese trebuchet was horrible.....

262
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:44,948
- Agreed.
- The inexorable decline of straight people.

263
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,407
Well, at least you've got rhythm in your blood.

264
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,337
Hey, man, it's not just that.

265
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,687
Affirmative.

266
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:51,667
You're rude.

267
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,008
They still make jokes about pussy,
like little kids.

268
00:14:54,091 --> 00:14:56,077
Let's wait to see what they come up with
Héléna and Humberto will come up with,

269
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,242
and in the meantime, pass me the wine.

270
00:14:57,325 --> 00:14:58,808
Now that's a really good one!

271
00:14:58,891 --> 00:15:00,527
Okay, repeat the presentation.

272
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:05,247
We're having asparagus pate as an appetizer.

273
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,330
with oranges.

274
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,974
Orange peel, peel.

275
00:15:08,057 --> 00:15:10,737
Orange peel
and sea bass burgers.

276
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,907
- No, that's sea bass.
- It's sea bass.

277
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,647
I said it's sea bass,
I went to the market, not you.

278
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,931
- It's the same thing, Umberto.
- It's not the same...

279
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,107
Okay, I'll get back to you later.

280
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:30,197
- Are you done eating that thing?
- Here they are, easy, easy.....

281
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,117
So, are you ready?

282
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,697
For an appetizer today.
would like to offer you

283
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:38,407
asparagus pâté

284
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,191
orange peeled

285
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:42,747
and fish bisque.

286
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:43,717
However!

287
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,707
From the perch, to be exact.

288
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:49,437
And the second one is simple, but with a new twist,
because, as Nello teaches us,

289
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,931
if you make it new,
you could sell it for twice as much.

290
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:56,811
And it's the beef that's...

291
00:15:57,977 --> 00:15:59,028
We have to go.

292
00:16:03,497 --> 00:16:05,087
I'm sorry, unfortunately,

293
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:07,267
it's an emergency, I need to get back to city hall.

294
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,299
It's really important, I'm sorry.

295
00:16:09,382 --> 00:16:12,447
Daughter, mommy has an emergency,
and she has to go to work.

296
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,177
I'll see you tomorrow, right?

297
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,677
- Bye. Bye.
- Bye, daughter.

298
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,247
- Bye, guys.
- Bye. Bye.

299
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,165
Don't tell her "tomorrow" if it's not tomorrow.

300
00:16:21,588 --> 00:16:22,877
Sorry again!

301
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,148
- Have fun!
- Bye!

302
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,285
Well...

303
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,628
Here's our dish, I'll get the rest.

304
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,754
Did you vote the right way?

305
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:32,325
He cheated off you?

306
00:16:32,845 --> 00:16:34,437
Let's do the math, shall we?

307
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,320
You didn't even say hello to me.

308
00:16:36,982 --> 00:16:38,337
- Yeah.
- Hey, you two!

309
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,077
There are children here!

310
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,574
Sorry, there's a couple gay guys here,
illegal immigrant, fat guy,

311
00:16:43,657 --> 00:16:45,727
and your problem is,
is that I said hello to my wife?

312
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,542
- Viola...
- With his wife.

313
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,317
We've been together ten years,
can you say "wife"?

314
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,627
What else should I call you?

315
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,748
Roommate, partner?

316
00:16:54,868 --> 00:16:55,868
Zoé?

317
00:16:56,662 --> 00:16:58,077
Okay, Zoya.

318
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,019
No, Zoe.

319
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,537
Spain - Italy: 2 - 1.

320
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,267
And now for the final tally.

321
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:04,807
Come on, princess, summarize.

322
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,200
It's that princess again!

323
00:17:07,725 --> 00:17:09,037
39.

324
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,187
О, 39!

325
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,957
Humberto, basically,
except for the bickering,

326
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,327
the result tastes great!

327
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,560
An altercation?

328
00:17:17,085 --> 00:17:20,677
Well, for a couple, bickering
it's normal, isn't it?

329
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,437
- Yeah, it's revitalizing.
- It sure does!

330
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,557
- If there's a relationship.
- Well, you need distance, too.

331
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,545
Are we done with the rhetorical phrases?

332
00:17:30,628 --> 00:17:31,539
Look at them!

333
00:17:31,622 --> 00:17:33,340
They are always together and never fight.

334
00:17:40,925 --> 00:17:43,048
Or maybe in a video game...

335
00:17:43,131 --> 00:17:45,807
something unexpected happens?

336
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,885
It's an artificial intelligence dream come true.

337
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:52,687
The problem is, what exactly
that drives the human mind

338
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:53,867
to push the boundaries?

339
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,048
Curiosity.

340
00:17:55,131 --> 00:17:58,857
Ah...the best game is a precise calculation.

341
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:03,805
So your video game can't anticipate
anticipate any more than you do?

342
00:18:05,028 --> 00:18:06,377
Thankfully, no.

343
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,747
I'm sleeping, okay?

344
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,965
I'm very tired.

345
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:13,870
Good night.

346
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,027
CHAPTER THREE: PIANO

347
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,397
MEANING OF THE WORD: SLOW

348
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,997
EXAMPLE: GO SLOW

349
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,185
OR: "PLAN" IS A STRATEGY
RESULT ACHIEVEMENT

350
00:18:25,268 --> 00:18:27,010
EXAMPLE: HE HAD A PLAN

351
00:18:41,497 --> 00:18:45,817
Dear Zoya, I read your letter,
but I decided not to respond publicly.

352
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,454
In order to do that, I'm gonna need
a little more of your story.

353
00:18:48,537 --> 00:18:49,537
Marquez.

354
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,405
I didn't wait for an answer.

355
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,188
I've never written in a magazine
and I don't know what it's like.

356
00:19:26,045 --> 00:19:27,657
So why did you text me?

357
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:38,267
"Living with someone for over seven years

358
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:42,387
can be an act of great
heroism... or great cowardice.

359
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,167
It's up to you to decide what it is."

360
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,327
My bad, those are my words.

361
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,831
That sentence struck me,
and I wrote to you,

362
00:19:48,914 --> 00:19:50,194
just like that, without thinking.

363
00:19:51,497 --> 00:19:52,925
Did you meet another man?

364
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,120
- Zoya!
- I'm sorry it's so late.

365
00:20:17,691 --> 00:20:20,257
Tom, you left
a bunch of hair in the sink again.

366
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,077
It's for the hundredth time, even on a toothbrush!

367
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,057
- Going to work already?
- Yes, the Japanese.

368
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,997
They're long awake. Put it away!

369
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,007
How much work do these Japanese people do...

370
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,157
- I'll clean it up later.
- You'll clean it up later, yeah.

371
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,240
Then...

372
00:20:39,417 --> 00:20:40,868
No, no one else.

373
00:20:41,394 --> 00:20:42,422
It's just me.

374
00:20:53,805 --> 00:20:56,257
Don't look, there's two paparazzi outside.

375
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,517
Even here, I'm being watched.

376
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,617
Why are you here?

377
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,047
Did you see what Nello had?

378
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,307
I can't take it anymore!

379
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,865
I did, but it was an emergency.

380
00:21:02,948 --> 00:21:05,067
Always an emergency, every day!

381
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:08,107
She's the mayor, Umberto,
and we're a pretty complicated town.

382
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,757
You should put yourself in my shoes.....

383
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,748
- Excuse me, can I take a selfie?
- Uh, yeah, sure.

384
00:21:13,622 --> 00:21:15,397
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

385
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,480
I'm taking selfies.

386
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,087
Do you understand? In selfies!

387
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,987
I can't take another two years of this.

388
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,874
What if she goes to the polls again?
Ten years of this kind of life is not for me!

389
00:21:24,925 --> 00:21:27,577
I think it's really time to break up.

390
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,857
- I don't understand.
- What?

391
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,957
I don't understand how anyone could ever think
to break up with someone

392
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,387
so suddenly.

393
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:36,957
What are you talking about, Tommaso,
don't you understand how I live now?

394
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,960
- No.
- I don't want that anymore.

395
00:21:39,794 --> 00:21:40,957
What do you want?

396
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,677
I'd like to talk to Helena,
not her press office.

397
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,137
Understand, I'm certainly proud that she's the mayor of Rome.....

398
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,967
And I can even understand
that this is a difficult time for the city,

399
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:51,867
and I don't want to get in her way, but I can't do it anymore!

400
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,937
Have you thought about how Matilda will suffer?

401
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,034
Of course, yes, I'm always thinking about her.

402
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,687
- But I'm going to teach her an important lesson.
- What's that?

403
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,287
"Put yourself first,

404
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:01,587
and if you're unhappy somewhere,

405
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,937
you can take your life in your hands and walk away,

406
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,417
even from an unhappy marriage."

407
00:22:06,434 --> 00:22:07,987
Is your marriage unhappy?

408
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,977
Not unhappy, it's no longer a marriage.

409
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,960
Lucky you, you're having a good time with Zoey.

410
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,160
- Coffee?
- Yeah.

411
00:22:32,571 --> 00:22:35,237
Before I give you any advice,
tell me about your boyfriend.

412
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,257
What's he like?

413
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,948
Personality, irony, sex?

414
00:22:48,114 --> 00:22:49,531
"Personality on a C.

415
00:22:50,148 --> 00:22:51,508
Irony is a C-plus.

416
00:22:53,074 --> 00:22:54,662
Sex is a three with two minuses..."

417
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,994
What's three with two minuses?

418
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,797
She gave me a report card!

419
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,880
А?

420
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,851
Uh, no, no, nothing.

421
00:23:14,148 --> 00:23:16,674
Avocado and tuna or salmon and kelp?

422
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,017
- Me...
- "I don't care."

423
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:22,427
Listen, you've been weird lately.

424
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:25,017
But...is there a problem?

425
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,257
You never ask me questions like that.

426
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,527
Because you're not usually weird.

427
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,874
I have problems at work, that's all.

428
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,197
You talk to me about work
you only tell me about the problems.

429
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,925
There's a little more now, Tom.

430
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,211
You faked an orgasm with me?

431
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:50,291
I'm sorry?

432
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,542
Just asking.

433
00:23:55,051 --> 00:23:56,994
Am I having an orgasm with you?

434
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,650
I don't think so.

435
00:23:59,542 --> 00:24:00,542
So, no.

436
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,091
Have the gentlemen chosen yet?

437
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:05,188
- Yeah, salmon and kelp.
- Me, too.

438
00:24:06,617 --> 00:24:09,805
How did you come up with the idea
to write to the magazine?

439
00:24:10,811 --> 00:24:12,800
You don't even dare admit it to me.

440
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,250
Zoya,

441
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,057
your letter came to me.

442
00:24:19,874 --> 00:24:20,874
Tom!

443
00:24:22,891 --> 00:24:25,382
Do you want to try
two-player mode with me?

444
00:24:26,628 --> 00:24:28,337
There's something wrong with the demo.

445
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,307
Yes...

446
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:30,390
Yes?

447
00:24:31,714 --> 00:24:33,462
- You ready?
- Moment.

448
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,411
- I'm ready.
- Let's go.

449
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:57,800
Seriously?

450
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:00,027
What are you doing?

451
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,931
If you kill me, it's over, hello!

452
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,305
Help from you.

453
00:25:04,388 --> 00:25:05,388
I'm sorry.

454
00:25:05,954 --> 00:25:08,147
And Frangipane's antics today?

455
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,887
Shall we discuss it, or what?

456
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:12,397
I'm speechless, speechless!

457
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,697
What did I say?

458
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,307
No, Giulio, I'm sorry,

459
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:19,002
only emotional education
can defeat gender-based violence today,

460
00:25:19,085 --> 00:25:21,017
not the police, I'm sorry.

461
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,980
Oh, yeah!

462
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,348
We need to change course, Giulio!

463
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,920
Of course!

464
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:29,597
To this day, schools still have a soccer field.

465
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,377
The boys play,
and the girls sit and watch!

466
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,751
At most, they walk on a tire
or playing classics!

467
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:36,068
That's right, yes!

468
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:39,094
That's what I'm saying, let's take action.

469
00:25:39,177 --> 00:25:41,767
Let's get the principals involved, the parents ...

470
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:43,577
And talk about equal opportunity.

471
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,877
Of course!

472
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,907
We need witnesses, okay.

473
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,907
Let's take a poll, yes.

474
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:51,254
Let's hurry up,
because if this keeps up,

475
00:25:51,337 --> 00:25:52,811
I don't know how long I can hold out.

476
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,077
Yeah, okay.

477
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,537
See you tomorrow, thanks, bye.

478
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,667
"My family is a family in reverse.

479
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,562
Daddy cooks, does my homework with me,

480
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:04,307
drying my hair
and reads me bedtime books.

481
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:05,787
I love my daddy very much,

482
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:10,227
and my mom, too, even though she's often not home.
She often works on television.

483
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:13,497
She's very famous,
and my dad is very kind.

484
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,157
It's the other way around in the family
of my friend Vittoria,

485
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,225
because her dad is
is a very famous actor,

486
00:26:18,308 --> 00:26:20,877
and my mom is a very kind woman."

487
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,857
You see?

488
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,685
Men are changing at last, aren't they?

489
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:27,117
What's this girl's mom doing?

490
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,817
- I want to write to her, she's very--
- She's the mayor of Rome.

491
00:26:34,194 --> 00:26:35,391
А...

492
00:26:35,474 --> 00:26:37,394
- Matilda's essay?
- Yes.

493
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:41,127
See, she's a smart and modern girl,

494
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:43,117
because writing these things is no small thing....

495
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,088
Helena, that's not the point
of our daughter's essay.

496
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:47,387
But that's exactly the point, sorry.....

497
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,857
No, try going beyond the words,
listen to what's in there.

498
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,227
Umberto, the point is exactly the point,

499
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:54,557
that our daughter will not spend
wait her whole life for Prince Charming,

500
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,065
who's gonna bring her this.

501
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:58,408
I've been wearing them since this morning and my legs are tired.

502
00:26:58,491 --> 00:26:59,494
What's that got to do with it?

503
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:02,067
I'm telling you, Matilda
is trying to tell you something else.

504
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,017
I'm sorry...

505
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,805
Vanya, did you read Bernabei's interview?

506
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,767
Why does he keep
challenging the pedestrian zone?

507
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,307
It's already decided!

508
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,637
Of course!

509
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,307
Cook rice for the signora?

510
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:15,247
- Thanks, Gladys, I'll do it.
- ...pedestrian zone.

511
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:18,097
Bernabei always does
what he wants, sorry, Vanya!

512
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,382
All right, that's enough.

513
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:26,042
Watching you put
your book in front of others,

514
00:27:26,125 --> 00:27:27,397
incredibly sad!

515
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,691
Everyone does it, even famous writers.

516
00:27:30,765 --> 00:27:31,765
And what's that?

517
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,971
What have you decided with Helena?

518
00:27:34,034 --> 00:27:35,267
Break up with her.

519
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,017
Humberto, you've been together 20 years,

520
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,162
How can you let a marriage go to waste like that?

521
00:27:39,245 --> 00:27:41,457
I don't know what's gotten into everybody.

522
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,967
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I am.

523
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:47,622
We just have to find a way
that doesn't hurt Helena's public image.

524
00:27:48,422 --> 00:27:50,907
And I... I don't know how to say this.

525
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,037
You already asked me that,

526
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,367
I don't know what to tell you
to tell you or advise you.

527
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:56,787
Well, you spend every week
advising strangers

528
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:59,147
always something true, precise, subtle,

529
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:01,297
and you can't say
a few words to your best friend?

530
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,557
It's not like that when it comes to you.

531
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,539
I respond to strangers.

532
00:28:05,622 --> 00:28:08,197
And I still don't understand
why you would do something so stupid.

533
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,917
- Well, I'll give you the reasons why.
- Go ahead.

534
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,197
First of all, I'm in the public eye now,
including physically.

535
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,594
Second, she's talking crap
about male emotional emancipation.

536
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,437
Third, I do everything
that a mom should do.

537
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,219
I have seven more of these items, shall I continue?

538
00:28:21,302 --> 00:28:23,117
No, what's the problem,
embarrassed to be a "pama"?

539
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,287
No, don't say that word,

540
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,517
"pama" is a sexist expression.

541
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,767
I said that once
and I fought with Helena for three days.

542
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,017
I'm a father.

543
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,297
And it's not about what I do,
it's about what I don't do anymore,

544
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,128
starting with sex, that's four,

545
00:28:35,211 --> 00:28:38,267
and, from a prostate perspective,
that can't be underestimated either.

546
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,897
Fifth, I'm not a husband anymore.

547
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:43,047
Sixth, I'm no longer a teacher,
which has serious consequences.

548
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:45,642
Seven, that the students don't know
who Italo Calvino is.

549
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:47,402
Now do you understand my situation?

550
00:28:47,485 --> 00:28:48,485
Here you go.

551
00:28:50,422 --> 00:28:51,440
Listen, Humberto.

552
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,277
If you could anonymously
ask Helena about your relationship,

553
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,817
what would you ask?

554
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,705
I don't get it, what do you mean?

555
00:28:58,788 --> 00:29:02,287
If you could
get her to confess something,

556
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:05,139
not knowing that she's admitting it to you.

557
00:29:05,222 --> 00:29:08,377
Like, if she's cheating on you
or if she still loves you, I don't know.

558
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,817
What would you ask?

559
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,365
Tommaso, I don't understand shit.

560
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,834
Well, I'd ask Ellena....

561
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,371
I'd ask her if she was happy.

562
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,411
Or unhappy, as I am now.

563
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,887
The problem with the fourth mission.

564
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,687
And on top of all the glitches,

565
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:33,507
the fact that you can so easily
to kill your playmate is, uh.

566
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,787
Yes, that's right, in connection with this.....

567
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:37,197
No, there should at least be
the controller vibrating.

568
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,537
But what we wanted to do, Zoya.

569
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,537
We have to make it more unstable, okay?

570
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,317
We're a few days away from the 27th,

571
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,820
and I want to meet you.

572
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:47,485
You want to play a game?

573
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,897
I work with games.

574
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,794
So it all depends on the game.

575
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,188
Write me something
that you hate about him.

576
00:30:19,565 --> 00:30:20,685
It's a beautiful song, isn't it?

577
00:30:37,188 --> 00:30:38,787
- Esther!
- Hey!

578
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,477
- Hey!
- How are you, sister?

579
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,937
- Hello, daughter-in-law!
- Hello, son-in-law.

580
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,534
- Flavio!
- So, how are you?

581
00:30:44,617 --> 00:30:45,857
- How's your stomach?
- It's good.

582
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,857
- Brother-in-law?
- Yes!

583
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,940
Here I am.

584
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,657
Tell the truth,

585
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,547
did it make you happy that I asked you
to help us move today?

586
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:55,414
It's like waking up on your day off and saying:

587
00:30:55,497 --> 00:30:58,537
"What would be wacky this morning?
A good move."

588
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,877
Relax, I've got it all done.

589
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,165
- All that's left is the light stuff.
- Yeah, I can see that.

590
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,125
- Hey, what about Abel?
- Hands up!

591
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:10,467
- Who is it?
- Now you're gonna help me pack!

592
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:12,717
Okay, your uncle will help you pack,

593
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,691
but first I have to
help my dad carry the boxes.

594
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,457
All right?

595
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,540
Bye, sweetie!

596
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:24,527
How's the apartment search going?

597
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:25,467
All right. (chuckles)

598
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,327
I'm looking, and Zoya says no.

599
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:28,287
Are you talking to me?

600
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:30,007
Esther drove me crazy looking for a house.

601
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:31,107
Yes...

602
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,337
He doesn't drive.

603
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,907
He hates driving,
so I have to drive myself.

604
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:36,571
Dump a man if he doesn't drive?

605
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,110
Drives what?

606
00:31:40,091 --> 00:31:42,251
No, that's okay. I'm gonna go get other things.

607
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:49,147
Two: hair, everywhere.

608
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:52,011
You should have seen the bathroom after he shaved.

609
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:57,862
Three, he's 43 years old,
and he still dresses like a 20-year-old.

610
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,182
Fourth, he only listens
only to depressing music.

611
00:32:14,708 --> 00:32:17,787
Five: "I don't care."
He always says that.

612
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:19,237
He never offers anything.

613
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,707
Restaurants, trips, movies--
it's always me.

614
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,868
But you like to organize things.

615
00:32:30,034 --> 00:32:33,600
Six: he still hasn't learned
how to say my name.

616
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:37,767
Seven: he's stupid.

617
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:41,277
His new novel is out of print
because he won't change the ending.

618
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,197
"Commercial" is a terrible word for him.

619
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,697
I asked for one thing...

620
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,500
Tom?

621
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,867
Are you done?

622
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,902
No, we just started...

623
00:32:58,980 --> 00:32:59,897
Thank you.

624
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,617
- Abel, your skateboard.
- Yeah, Dad.

625
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:06,227
It's just scary to see a house like this.

626
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,437
You bet...

627
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,547
Then...

628
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:11,567
Everything's gone to hell with this move.

629
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:13,588
- These are your things.
- My stuff?

630
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,577
There's an essay.

631
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,367
Mom's letter?

632
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:19,725
Mom's letter, yeah.

633
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,251
Oh my god...

634
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,280
Need to write again, my goodness....

635
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:32,262
Actually, I don't think
it's irreparable.

636
00:33:34,228 --> 00:33:36,731
Eighth, I'm no longer happy
with him around.

637
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:40,822
Nine: Maybe
I just forgot how to be happy.

638
00:33:41,634 --> 00:33:43,622
Tenth: I don't know.

639
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,148
- You okay?
- Yeah, just... a little tired.

640
00:34:11,817 --> 00:34:12,817
Look, uh.

641
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,817
I'll drive.

642
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,537
No, no, I'll drive.

643
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,287
No, I'll drive, you park.

644
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:19,370
It's fine.

645
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,697
I haven't told her yet.
I'm waiting for the right time.

646
00:34:51,314 --> 00:34:53,105
- Help me!
- Again?

647
00:34:53,188 --> 00:34:54,497
Umberto, think carefully.

648
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:57,917
You know, breaking up
after all these years is crazy!

649
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,387
- It's gonna be hard, it's gonna be sad.
- Well, I already know that.

650
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:03,787
You'll have to box up the books,

651
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:06,537
fighting over CDs: "That's mine!
- No, it's yours..."

652
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,837
Sharing photos... How?

653
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,767
Official photos,
I'm always in the back, out of focus, okay.

654
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:14,111
Why don't you think about
about the good things between you two?

655
00:35:14,194 --> 00:35:15,897
Well, why don't you just focus on work?

656
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,337
At work? Look!

657
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,747
- We're alone, no one's here.
- Of course, everyone's in class.

658
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:22,627
Of course you are,
the kids are in class and I'm in the hallway!

659
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,577
I've been sent to the reserve,
I was marginalized.

660
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,897
- You know, me!
- They made you deputy director!

661
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:29,607
Exactly, also a mockery,
because it's the eighth:

662
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:32,387
not only am I unable to teach
because of administrative duties,

663
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:34,454
but, uh, the ninth:
According to the department head,

664
00:35:34,537 --> 00:35:38,127
a man in my position
can't just be a teacher, okay?

665
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:41,117
Me, who's used to being on the front lines!
I've been killed!

666
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,537
How much did I weigh three years ago?

667
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,434
Only 120 kilos! Do you understand?

668
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,548
- What?
- There's no tenth item.

669
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:50,100
Tenth...

670
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,947
Yes? Ah, here, come here, Laruffa.

671
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,297
How's the new teacher?

672
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,782
Have we passed Calvino yet?

673
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:57,430
Who, teacher?

674
00:35:58,548 --> 00:36:00,194
Number ten. Go on, go.

675
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,514
And this is one of the best.

676
00:36:07,908 --> 00:36:08,908
Hi.

677
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,934
What's the music?

678
00:36:11,017 --> 00:36:12,140
It lifts your spirits.

679
00:36:12,902 --> 00:36:14,067
What are you doing?

680
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:16,267
Working on a new ending for the novel.

681
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,897
- You did?
- Yeah.

682
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,394
As usual, the fridge is empty.

683
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:25,211
- I'm gonna order some food, okay?
- I ordered a Syrian restaurant.

684
00:36:27,314 --> 00:36:28,320
For 9:00 p.m.

685
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,640
All right. Uh-huh.

686
00:36:38,685 --> 00:36:40,137
- You like it?
- I do.

687
00:36:41,211 --> 00:36:42,677
Good evening, may I leave a menu?

688
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,147
Of course, thank you.

689
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,459
No, no, wait.

690
00:36:45,542 --> 00:36:46,467
This way...

691
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,387
- Mustabal...
- Yes.

692
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:51,437
Taratura Aleppo,
full Damascus and Fattoush for two.

693
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,731
- That's great.
- Uh, thank you.

694
00:36:55,074 --> 00:36:57,051
Well, I already looked it up online.

695
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,011
No, wait.

696
00:37:00,628 --> 00:37:01,628
I'll give it a shot.

697
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,087
No.

698
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:05,200
You take one of them,

699
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:08,034
then you put this in there.

700
00:37:11,737 --> 00:37:12,737
Try it!

701
00:37:14,205 --> 00:37:15,597
I've been thinking.

702
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,677
It's been a long time since we've been away for a weekend.

703
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,137
We were recently in Tuscany.

704
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,127
I mean alone,

705
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:23,200
without the whole horde of friends.

706
00:37:24,811 --> 00:37:25,847
I don't know if I can.

707
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:28,308
We have a project to deliver and we're behind.

708
00:37:28,971 --> 00:37:32,137
I don't have time
to find a hotel, buy tickets.

709
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,394
Maybe I can.

710
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,948
- Where do you want to go?
- Prague.

711
00:37:37,737 --> 00:37:38,637
Paris...

712
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,097
Places where couples go
barely start dating.

713
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,908
Or where couples who are in crisis go.

714
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,685
Beautiful cutlets!

715
00:37:53,748 --> 00:37:56,080
The more distant I get, the cuter he gets.

716
00:37:56,754 --> 00:37:58,207
This is awkward.

717
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:00,417
It's easier to start a war than to end it.

718
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,787
You've been through this?

719
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,927
How do you know all this?

720
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:06,397
Because I'm Gabriel Garcia Marquez.

721
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,437
Need I remind you that you're corresponding
with a famous dead writer.

722
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,797
Ironic, too.

723
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,185
I hope you're at least not ugly.

724
00:38:13,268 --> 00:38:14,268
Maybe.

725
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,851
What kind of guy are you?

726
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,160
I'll tell you myself.

727
00:38:19,611 --> 00:38:21,737
You seem rough, but you're fragile.

728
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,107
And when you're fragile, you get rude.

729
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:26,557
You pick the wine, you pay the bill.

730
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,157
and you know how to cheat.

731
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,240
Maybe.

732
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,285
You think I'm weird?

733
00:38:33,977 --> 00:38:35,379
I think you...

734
00:38:35,462 --> 00:38:36,462
original.

735
00:38:38,297 --> 00:38:39,707
I'm sorry!

736
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:40,877
Whoever it is,

737
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,197
he has to stop shaving in the bathroom.

738
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,127
First of all, it's not your house,

739
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:48,517
and when there's hair everywhere, I can't stand it.

740
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,600
Okay?

741
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,640
Thank you.

742
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,217
- I like it, what do you think?
- "My girlfriend..."

743
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:57,245
- That's the guy with the sock in his mouth!
- I must have made a mistake, it was from below.

744
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,348
Why are you here?

745
00:39:04,754 --> 00:39:05,754
There was no business.

746
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,137
Do you want to go for a walk?

747
00:39:08,982 --> 00:39:10,194
A walk?

748
00:39:11,462 --> 00:39:13,051
We live in Rome and we never walk.

749
00:39:14,182 --> 00:39:15,527
Where do you want to go?

750
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:17,097
It's been a rough day.

751
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,611
We'll take a walk while standing still.

752
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,274
Stop joking around.

753
00:39:24,034 --> 00:39:25,520
I'm not kidding, Zoya.

754
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,594
Kidding.

755
00:39:29,417 --> 00:39:30,514
Zo-e.

756
00:39:31,611 --> 00:39:32,705
Zoé.

757
00:39:32,788 --> 00:39:34,447
I can't say it.

758
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:36,411
I get "F" for "Foe."

759
00:39:37,165 --> 00:39:39,717
- It's difficult.
- Tongue between teeth...

760
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,188
If it's between the teeth, it's "Dzoe."

761
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,240
Thank you.

762
00:40:24,365 --> 00:40:25,937
CHAPTER FOUR: SOGNO

763
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:29,174
THE MEANING OF THE WORD "DREAM" -
A VISION OF THE FUTURE THAT YOU BELIEVE IN

764
00:40:29,257 --> 00:40:30,797
EXAMPLE: I HAVE A DREAM

765
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,177
OR: UNFOUNDED HOPE

766
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,097
EXAMPLE: IT'S JUST A DREAM

767
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:40,177
Now I have to ride a bike,
and I hate bikes!

768
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,517
Umberto, you can't
always complain about everything!

769
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:46,147
Tommaso, I have hemorrhoids,
so I have the right to complain!

770
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:48,637
Helena made me do it,
she started a campaign for bike lanes

771
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,997
and he says, "You can't be photographed
in the car again."

772
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,287
But there's no way in hell I'm ditching the car!

773
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:55,677
Compromise is normal for a couple.

774
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,337
You can change a little for her, can't you?

775
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,547
A little? Tommaso, I'm a different person,

776
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:03,497
You've known me for 25 years,
was I like this in college?

777
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,837
Yeah, in college.
we used to call you poor thing.

778
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,377
Para-param, para-param, para-param,

779
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,777
Para-para-para-pam-pam-pam, I screwed up!

780
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:12,567
I remember, but that's exactly why
she fell in love:

781
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:15,217
for my witty remarks
that got me in trouble.

782
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,057
She laughed, sometimes to the point of tears.

783
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,747
And now he's terrorizing me.

784
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:22,788
Now before I talk,
I have to count to five thousand!

785
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,742
Then it's easy.

786
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:27,010
Don't count anymore.

787
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,997
Don't give up your witty
your witty remarks, be like you were in your 20s.

788
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,411
Maybe then she'll stop
to tolerate you.

789
00:41:33,188 --> 00:41:35,405
How did it occur to you
to show up like that?

790
00:41:36,205 --> 00:41:37,207
Convenient.

791
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:39,520
No one asked you
to dress uncomfortable but clean!

792
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,331
Ah, just a coffee stain....

793
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,845
During the anthem, I'll put my hand over my heart....

794
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,040
Is this a matter of etiquette?

795
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,254
No, it's a rag question.

796
00:41:49,337 --> 00:41:50,970
Not etiquette, hygiene.

797
00:41:51,748 --> 00:41:52,927
You're a formalist, Héléna.

798
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:56,017
I'm not Helena here, I'm the mayor, and you're my...

799
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,788
I'm not, I'm always Umberto.

800
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:08,888
This way, this way, please!

801
00:42:08,971 --> 00:42:10,480
- The picture's from here!
- Mayor!

802
00:42:11,394 --> 00:42:12,394
One more shot!

803
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,926
- Thank you!
- Look here, please!

804
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:15,867
- Please take a look at this!
- Thank you.

805
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,782
Please stand during the national anthem!

806
00:42:21,702 --> 00:42:23,557
- Please.
- Yes, I am.

807
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,647
- Good luck, guys.
- Thank you.

808
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:27,287
It was just a joke, Héléna.

809
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:29,848
Don't you realize
that we're gonna be all over the papers tomorrow?

810
00:42:29,931 --> 00:42:31,497
I will be destroyed.

811
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,017
How can you say that?

812
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,674
We're already in a crisis!

813
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:38,057
- Are we in crisis?
- Of course we're in crisis.

814
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:42,057
The coalition has disintegrated, all the polls are against....

815
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,871
We're hanging by a thread.

816
00:42:43,954 --> 00:42:45,037
Is that funny?

817
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,027
What's so funny?

818
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:47,665
You laughed at my jokes once!

819
00:42:47,748 --> 00:42:50,017
Once! Not twice or thrice!

820
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,247
In fact, for what it's worth,

821
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:55,137
you were once proud of me for being in politics.

822
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:57,527
- Listen, uh.
- Can someone help me with my homework?

823
00:42:57,610 --> 00:42:59,725
- Yeah, baby. Now.
- Yes, baby. Daddy's gonna help.

824
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:09,777
Yesterday was a good day.

825
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,131
Things have gotten better,

826
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:13,245
and I'm thinking about leaving him.

827
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:15,360
It's all so weird.

828
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:17,748
Do you feel guilty?

829
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:25,357
He gave no reason to hurt him,

830
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,400
but sometimes I feel like I'm betraying him.

831
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,954
Did you cheat on him?

832
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:39,365
Yes.

833
00:43:44,045 --> 00:43:45,302
You really cheated?

834
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,051
A long time ago, but it has nothing to do
with this crisis.

835
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:56,114
- Zoya!
- What?

836
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,960
I'm gonna go take out the trash.

837
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,580
All right. Uh-huh.

838
00:44:12,777 --> 00:44:15,477
Anyway, he was cheating on me, too,

839
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,142
but I didn't tell him I knew it.

840
00:44:22,091 --> 00:44:23,467
Why didn't you tell him?

841
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:25,177
There was no problem between us.

842
00:44:25,931 --> 00:44:26,937
It happens.

843
00:44:28,902 --> 00:44:31,565
- Why'd you do it?
- It happens.

844
00:44:36,034 --> 00:44:38,502
I was suddenly terrified
at the thought of losing him.

845
00:44:49,325 --> 00:44:50,325
Are you coming to bed?

846
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,477
I'll write for a while and then I'll come back.

847
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,560
All right. Uh-huh.

848
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:12,697
- Nina, coffee, please.
- Right away.

849
00:45:15,097 --> 00:45:18,387
Speaking of the production bonus:
give my bonus to the guys.

850
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:21,047
I'm sure they'll be able
to achieve three percent development.

851
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:22,130
Suit yourself.

852
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,548
London called,

853
00:45:25,131 --> 00:45:27,207
want to expedite your arrival.

854
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:29,120
We'll announce it in five days.

855
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,997
I thought I had a few more weeks.

856
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,162
Why?

857
00:45:35,245 --> 00:45:36,454
You want to change your mind?

858
00:45:36,537 --> 00:45:38,068
No, no, no, no.

859
00:45:38,857 --> 00:45:41,428
But...I have some things I need to take care of.

860
00:45:43,108 --> 00:45:44,125
Handle it.

861
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:46,917
Tom?

862
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,517
Where are we going so elegant?

863
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,640
Surprise!

864
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:53,245
Listen, do you know how to tie this thing?

865
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,800
Which one?

866
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:57,542
Is that the surprise?

867
00:45:59,062 --> 00:46:00,157
Why?

868
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,117
Bad?

869
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,407
No, but I've never
seen you dressed like that.

870
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:05,490
All right. Uh-huh.

871
00:46:05,565 --> 00:46:07,157
There's always a first time.

872
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,477
Can you come here for a minute?

873
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,967
- I have something important to tell you.
- Zoya, we're late.

874
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:13,554
I'll take the car and wait downstairs,
hurry up, get dressed.

875
00:46:16,205 --> 00:46:17,680
Are you gonna tell me where we're going?

876
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:19,851
You go on in, I'll park.

877
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,537
Good evening, everyone,
and welcome to the presentation,

878
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:00,217
after years of waiting,

879
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:03,714
Tommaso Rosso's third, new novel.

880
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:10,777
I'd like to first read to you
a quote from the beginning of my book.

881
00:47:15,702 --> 00:47:19,402
"In that moment, there was nothing
"but quiet happiness.

882
00:47:19,485 --> 00:47:22,677
But he would have preferred mature unhappiness

883
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,474
that smooth glide,
no bumps, no waves,

884
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:27,257
without storms,

885
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:30,525
"like a giant ship
stuck in a pool."

886
00:47:34,422 --> 00:47:37,987
Are you saying you don't believe
in your romantic ending?

887
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:41,267
I know in novels, the author determines the ending,

888
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:43,268
as opposed to what happens in life.

889
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:38,365
There's another surprise.

890
00:48:39,028 --> 00:48:40,467
Another one?

891
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:43,074
- We're going to see a house.
- Now?

892
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,240
Now.

893
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,847
- Okay.
- This house is for sale.

894
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:53,542
It's smaller, but I think it's, uh,
it's perfect for us.

895
00:48:54,137 --> 00:48:55,257
So...

896
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:58,685
Wait...

897
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:01,288
Momentum...

898
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:02,371
Can you see anything?

899
00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:03,807
- Yeah. (chuckles)
- Uh-huh?

900
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:04,937
Okay...

901
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:06,870
Here we go.

902
00:49:07,417 --> 00:49:08,605
This is the living room.

903
00:49:10,331 --> 00:49:11,565
Look at the terrace!

904
00:49:12,114 --> 00:49:13,462
You can see all of Rome from here.

905
00:49:15,862 --> 00:49:18,045
There's the kitchen-dining room.

906
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:24,354
And here at the end,
there's an extra room, just in case.

907
00:49:24,982 --> 00:49:27,028
Look, open-beam ceiling.

908
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,257
Isn't that a miracle?

909
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,411
And here...

910
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,325
It's a bedroom

911
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:40,491
with a panoramic window.

912
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,142
Look at the light!

913
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:46,971
Wonderful...

914
00:51:01,405 --> 00:51:02,765
We made love.

915
00:51:03,805 --> 00:51:05,474
I'm pretty sure I don't love him anymore.

916
00:51:06,548 --> 00:51:08,194
How am I supposed to tell him now?

917
00:51:09,885 --> 00:51:11,057
CHAPTER FIVE: ACCETTA

918
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:14,305
OF THE MEANING OF THE WORD "ACCEPT" -
ACCEPT THAT THIS IS THE WAY IT SHOULD BE

919
00:51:14,388 --> 00:51:16,042
EXAMPLE: ACCEPT REALITY

920
00:51:16,125 --> 00:51:18,362
OR: "HATCHET" - A SMALL AXE

921
00:51:18,445 --> 00:51:20,470
EXAMPLE: HATCHET

922
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:25,325
Ellena realized something was wrong.

923
00:51:26,034 --> 00:51:29,562
The party realized she was in crisis,
and they called me and asked me to support her,

924
00:51:29,645 --> 00:51:33,417
because they're afraid that her anxiety
will affect the council's position.

925
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:34,822
They're afraid she'll drop everything.

926
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:36,660
Are you listening?

927
00:51:37,782 --> 00:51:38,782
Yeah, yeah.

928
00:51:39,474 --> 00:51:42,385
You thought it was as easy
as closing a company?

929
00:51:42,468 --> 00:51:44,320
It's about people, Umberto.

930
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:46,857
But when something is over, it's over.

931
00:51:47,428 --> 00:51:50,607
It's like... putting a Band-Aid on a wound.

932
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:53,748
I had just decided
to tell her everything tonight, even, uh.

933
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,717
I wrote another non-harmful speech....

934
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:57,800
May I?

935
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:00,790
Let's hear it.

936
00:52:03,291 --> 00:52:04,291
"Beloved,

937
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:08,437
everything I've felt for you
all these years, I can't describe.

938
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,070
I asked the poets for help.

939
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:13,631
"I must have climbed a million stairs
I descended by giving you my hand..."

940
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:15,037
Wait, Umberto.

941
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,017
First of all, Héléna is not dead.

942
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,637
So you want to break up with her,

943
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,174
starting with a declaration of love,
quoting Montale?

944
00:52:21,257 --> 00:52:22,099
Why.

945
00:52:22,182 --> 00:52:24,970
Why don't you tell the truth,
why don't you tell the goddamn truth?

946
00:52:26,205 --> 00:52:27,257
You don't love her anymore?

947
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,797
Tommaso, I love Helena,

948
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,557
but not the Helena that's with me now.

949
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,007
There's only one Héléna,

950
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:34,697
the one you're with right now.

951
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:37,714
And it's no use being nice and sweet, believe me.

952
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,148
You want my advice?

953
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:43,185
Here's what Marquez would say.

954
00:52:43,268 --> 00:52:44,811
That's the old ending to my book.

955
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,320
Yeah, but, uh.

956
00:52:50,137 --> 00:52:52,157
I can't tell her all this like this.

957
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,068
You told me all of this yourself.

958
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:56,834
How you've felt all these years.

959
00:52:57,485 --> 00:52:58,765
Or have you forgotten?

960
00:53:02,982 --> 00:53:05,314
Nina, would you be willing
to come to London with me?

961
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:08,148
I don't know.

962
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,908
But I think that's
that's up to the brass, not me.

963
00:53:19,257 --> 00:53:20,657
What if it were up to you?

964
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:23,047
I recently started living together

965
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:25,245
and I need to talk to my boyfriend.

966
00:53:30,285 --> 00:53:32,102
- Did I say something wrong?
- No, you didn't.

967
00:53:32,617 --> 00:53:33,707
How did you two meet?

968
00:53:33,790 --> 00:53:37,057
In one chat room, the site's support chat room.

969
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:39,177
We wrote to each other,

970
00:53:39,828 --> 00:53:41,757
then we met,

971
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:43,120
love at first sight.

972
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,848
I hope you weren't chatting during work hours.

973
00:53:47,931 --> 00:53:48,931
No.

974
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,371
A couple of chairs...

975
00:54:06,674 --> 00:54:07,894
On this side...

976
00:54:07,977 --> 00:54:10,720
I've never done anything
irrational in my entire life,

977
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,800
but I'd like to meet you.

978
00:54:13,965 --> 00:54:16,897
One second, this is an important message,
and I have to-- I have to take this.

979
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:18,437
Why do you want to see me?

980
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,022
I don't even know what you look like.

981
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:24,491
But I have a feeling that in a few days.
you've gotten to know me better than Tommaso.

982
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:26,817
And you can also help me

983
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,740
to find the right words
to break up with him.

984
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:36,331
I could be one of those two.

985
00:54:38,091 --> 00:54:39,457
Or none of them.

986
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:40,867
It doesn't matter.

987
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:42,480
I'm willing to take the risk.

988
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:44,405
What about you?

989
00:54:47,908 --> 00:54:50,257
6:00 p.m., Del Fico's Bar.

990
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:51,474
How do you recognize me?

991
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:53,287
You're as beautiful as a painting,

992
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:55,622
with a nervous look on her face
and black nail polish.

993
00:55:08,685 --> 00:55:10,251
- Hey. (chuckles)
- Hey. (chuckles)

994
00:55:11,794 --> 00:55:13,307
Why are you dressed like that?

995
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:15,782
Ah, nonsense, an aperitif with the bosses.

996
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:18,217
I'll go straight to the restaurant from there, okay?

997
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:20,045
Uh, okay. Zoya?

998
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:22,877
Yes?

999
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:23,960
Will you give me a hug?

1000
00:55:26,010 --> 00:55:27,108
What do you mean?

1001
00:55:28,068 --> 00:55:29,462
I mean, a hug.

1002
00:55:31,337 --> 00:55:33,782
Okay, but you don't ask that kind of thing.

1003
00:55:34,388 --> 00:55:35,531
It happens spontaneously.

1004
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:38,417
But not you.

1005
00:55:39,862 --> 00:55:40,862
Not true.

1006
00:55:53,165 --> 00:55:54,365
I'm gonna go, it's getting late.

1007
00:56:12,834 --> 00:56:14,022
I'll have a gin and tonic!

1008
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:18,060
Tom?

1009
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:20,091
What are you doing here?

1010
00:56:24,468 --> 00:56:26,685
I invited Umberto over for a beer, but, uh.

1011
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:28,720
But I didn't think you'd come here.

1012
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:32,042
Wait a minute. I've got a sticking point.

1013
00:56:32,125 --> 00:56:33,125
Who are you writing to?

1014
00:56:33,771 --> 00:56:34,800
To the bosses.

1015
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:37,085
Asked why they were late.

1016
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:42,930
It's Umberto.

1017
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,788
He's got an override, he's not coming.

1018
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:48,377
- Well, I'll be off.
- Bye.

1019
00:56:52,845 --> 00:56:53,845
Zoya,

1020
00:56:55,005 --> 00:56:56,080
what's wrong with you?

1021
00:56:57,451 --> 00:57:01,508
You can't say "nothing"
or "problems at work."

1022
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:04,948
Right, please, as always before.

1023
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,811
I've been offered a move to London.

1024
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,987
- It's a promotion, Tom.
- И?

1025
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:14,022
- Can I get you anything?
- No, nothing, thank you.

1026
00:57:14,834 --> 00:57:16,240
Why didn't you say so before?

1027
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,407
You've never taken much
interested in my work.

1028
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:22,099
And you're mine,

1029
00:57:22,182 --> 00:57:23,851
you don't even know who I'm writing for.

1030
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:27,005
But right now, it's about both of us.

1031
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,457
Why didn't you tell me?

1032
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:33,970
Because it's a decision
that I want to make.

1033
00:57:35,222 --> 00:57:36,222
alone.

1034
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:42,137
And...have you decided?

1035
00:57:44,171 --> 00:57:45,200
Not yet.

1036
00:57:48,925 --> 00:57:49,942
Well, I'm gonna go.

1037
00:57:50,605 --> 00:57:51,657
Here comes the brass.

1038
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:53,517
Tell him I said hi.

1039
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:56,305
I'll see you right at Nello's, okay?

1040
00:57:56,388 --> 00:57:57,388
All right. Uh-huh.

1041
00:58:07,634 --> 00:58:08,742
You didn't come.

1042
00:58:10,742 --> 00:58:12,667
I saw you with a man and I left.

1043
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:14,237
It's you, I'm sure of it.

1044
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:15,520
I was with Tommaso.

1045
00:58:16,210 --> 00:58:17,817
Now I've seen you, it's all clear to me.

1046
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:19,457
Don't delay.

1047
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:21,528
You don't need my words anymore.

1048
00:58:21,611 --> 00:58:22,611
Drop it.

1049
00:58:36,777 --> 00:58:38,148
Héléna, listen to me.

1050
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:40,457
Come on, come on, I'm listening.

1051
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:43,394
I should tell you something,
but I thought I'd write.

1052
00:58:44,217 --> 00:58:47,939
"During those years, I felt
"abandoned, humiliated,

1053
00:58:48,022 --> 00:58:49,917
set aside like a trinket,

1054
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,327
like an old glass ball
with snow inside.

1055
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:54,137
I thought the snow wasn't there anymore.

1056
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:56,868
But one day I turned the ball over,
and the snow started spinning like it used to.

1057
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,342
That was the hundredth time
I've seen something without you.

1058
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,627
I can't stand your late-night meetings anymore,

1059
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:04,967
constant emergencies,

1060
00:59:05,050 --> 00:59:08,187
the way you get angry
when they change the road network.

1061
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:11,447
But most of all, I can't
not be who I want to be anymore:

1062
00:59:11,530 --> 00:59:12,594
by a teacher,

1063
00:59:13,554 --> 00:59:14,554
husband,

1064
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:16,600
a man."

1065
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:19,348
Whose writing is this?

1066
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:26,080
You didn't even listen to me
when I came to ask for a divorce.

1067
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:30,891
I heard every word.

1068
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:33,090
It doesn't look like it.

1069
00:59:34,890 --> 00:59:36,217
When have I ever humiliated you?

1070
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:39,542
Who stopped you from teaching? Being a man?

1071
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:41,577
"Snowballing" again?

1072
00:59:42,434 --> 00:59:43,714
Well, have I been listening well?

1073
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:45,457
Not even the last sentence?

1074
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:48,411
I'm a woman, Umberto,
I can do many things at once.

1075
00:59:49,870 --> 00:59:51,257
When we started living together,

1076
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:53,617
you knew what I wanted to do.

1077
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:55,505
Politics is my mission, Umberto.

1078
00:59:55,588 --> 00:59:58,454
It's one thing to go to a meeting,
to see "We loved each other so much."

1079
00:59:58,537 --> 00:59:59,574
to eat pork,

1080
00:59:59,657 --> 01:00:02,097
to discuss the society
that we leave to our children.

1081
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:04,217
It's another thing
is to live a life of constant inactivity,

1082
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,351
where's my moment of fame--
magazine cover photo,

1083
01:00:06,434 --> 01:00:07,517
where I fall off my bike!

1084
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:11,267
With all of our city's problems.
do you care how you came out in the picture?

1085
01:00:11,350 --> 01:00:14,248
No, what I care about
that I go to the store with security,

1086
01:00:14,331 --> 01:00:16,387
who's judging me
that I bought a discount ham!

1087
01:00:16,470 --> 01:00:19,827
What worries me is that during your self-imposed isolation.
you were hardly ever home!

1088
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:22,742
We're the only ones
who didn't stay home together during quarantine!

1089
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:30,602
First of all, don't raise your voice at me.

1090
01:00:30,685 --> 01:00:32,357
- I didn't raise my voice.
- You're raising your voice!

1091
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:33,587
And now you're stepping it up!

1092
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:35,367
And, two, you have no idea,

1093
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:37,167
that I've had to deal with
in that time.

1094
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:39,162
What, am I, the mayor of Rome, going to sit at home?

1095
01:00:39,245 --> 01:00:41,587
- Do you realize what you're saying?
- Yes, I do.

1096
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:43,477
I realize there's always a problem.

1097
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:46,097
Years of formal dinners
where I ate poorly and ate little,

1098
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:47,887
terrified of which fork to get,

1099
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:50,307
scolded for pouring water
in the wrong cup.

1100
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:53,059
Can't you see we've changed?
Everything has changed.

1101
01:00:53,142 --> 01:00:55,357
Don't be a child, Umberto.

1102
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,337
So tell me, what exactly has changed?

1103
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:00,517
- What's changed?
- Everything, Héléna, everything has changed, everything!

1104
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:03,527
Now, we used to organize demonstrations
against the exploitation of the workers,

1105
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:04,897
and now we have two Filipinos!

1106
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:05,985
Formalized,

1107
01:01:06,068 --> 01:01:08,447
and we pay taxes, vacation pay,
13th paycheck, what's the big deal?

1108
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:10,567
In that I want to give back to my students,

1109
01:01:10,650 --> 01:01:12,697
my car and my marriage!

1110
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,440
You want your 20s back.

1111
01:01:19,005 --> 01:01:20,388
And that I can even understand.

1112
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:23,562
I know I'm very busy,

1113
01:01:23,645 --> 01:01:25,470
but you can't
ask me to do that right now.

1114
01:01:26,491 --> 01:01:28,674
Wait a few months, we'll figure it out.

1115
01:01:29,725 --> 01:01:30,994
There are things like this,

1116
01:01:32,010 --> 01:01:33,847
that affect everyone.

1117
01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:35,797
And if you're betting our marriage

1118
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:37,227
above the best interests of our city,

1119
01:01:37,310 --> 01:01:39,497
you're ungrateful and irresponsible.

1120
01:01:40,171 --> 01:01:41,565
A crisis of the party?

1121
01:01:42,628 --> 01:01:44,514
The interests of the city, Héléna?

1122
01:01:45,405 --> 01:01:47,851
You've completely lost your sense of proportion.

1123
01:01:50,285 --> 01:01:51,337
You don't love me anymore?

1124
01:01:56,022 --> 01:01:58,774
I'm no longer in love
a cold, formal lady,

1125
01:01:58,857 --> 01:02:00,137
that's standing in front of me.

1126
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:03,782
Now sign my restraining order to keep you.

1127
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:13,977
By the way, it's been an hour.

1128
01:02:15,222 --> 01:02:17,611
I should have borrowed Esther's
a Spanish frying pan.

1129
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:19,974
A frying pan is like a frying pan.

1130
01:02:20,057 --> 01:02:23,307
No, "paella" is a special skillet,
not just the recipe.

1131
01:02:23,390 --> 01:02:25,257
The frying pan matters, Tom.

1132
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:28,285
Okay, hand me two sheets of newspaper.

1133
01:02:30,834 --> 01:02:32,514
If you want, you can wait there.

1134
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,927
That's not what we were going to do.

1135
01:02:35,010 --> 01:02:36,411
We decided it together.

1136
01:02:36,910 --> 01:02:39,257
Not all decisions are made together, it seems.

1137
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:40,967
- Working in London, Tom, it's, uh.
- No, no, no.

1138
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:42,050
Uh, hold on.

1139
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,157
What do I have to look forward to?

1140
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:45,862
Just to let the rice dry, okay?

1141
01:02:47,531 --> 01:02:48,531
All right. Uh-huh.

1142
01:02:49,645 --> 01:02:50,697
We'll wait.

1143
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:53,360
How much did it come out to, baby?

1144
01:02:54,850 --> 01:02:56,342
You can't even be called baby?

1145
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,837
Okay, let's go.

1146
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:00,487
24 points.

1147
01:03:00,570 --> 01:03:01,727
24!

1148
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:05,307
Guys, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid,
Spain won't get a prize tonight.

1149
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:07,627
- The rice was a little overcooked.
- Yeah.

1150
01:03:07,710 --> 01:03:10,527
- The squid was a little tough.
- And the dessert was gross.

1151
01:03:10,610 --> 01:03:13,397
You don't say "disgusting."
they say "didn't like it."

1152
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:15,714
Yeah, I didn't like him,
because he was mean.

1153
01:03:17,485 --> 01:03:19,987
We had a disagreement on the menu.

1154
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:22,167
My fault, I was a little nervous.

1155
01:03:22,250 --> 01:03:24,305
Then, the frying pan is no good.

1156
01:03:24,388 --> 01:03:25,987
Attention!

1157
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:28,067
Now it's the frying pan's fault!

1158
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:29,727
Did the agitator fit?

1159
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:31,447
Like when you lose at tennis.

1160
01:03:31,530 --> 01:03:33,187
It's always the racket's fault.

1161
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:34,957
This is typical of Italians.

1162
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:36,605
It's always someone else's fault.

1163
01:03:37,131 --> 01:03:38,422
Always!

1164
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:40,674
Why so gloomy?

1165
01:03:42,130 --> 01:03:43,394
It's a game, right?

1166
01:04:00,971 --> 01:04:03,748
A high-pressure zone from northern Europe...

1167
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:06,842
Tommaso, we need to talk.

1168
01:04:06,925 --> 01:04:08,837
- Check the readiness...
- We'll talk.

1169
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:11,127
- Now that the cake--
- Turn it off, please.

1170
01:04:11,210 --> 01:04:13,474
You can sprinkle powdered sugar on top.....

1171
01:04:14,731 --> 01:04:15,760
You're welcome.

1172
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:28,807
It's really hard for me to find the right words.

1173
01:04:28,890 --> 01:04:29,890
Don't pick it up.

1174
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,240
It's all right.

1175
01:04:33,405 --> 01:04:35,147
It's very clear, Zoya.

1176
01:04:35,230 --> 01:04:36,837
It's been a long time coming.

1177
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:40,068
I don't want to sit here and listen
your pity speech about how

1178
01:04:40,605 --> 01:04:42,434
that it's over between us.

1179
01:04:45,028 --> 01:04:46,028
I'm sorry.

1180
01:04:46,571 --> 01:04:47,571
Okay...

1181
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:52,308
I don't know what's happening to me.

1182
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:56,102
I assure you that I will always
I'll always be here for you, you know.

1183
01:05:01,497 --> 01:05:03,947
"I'll always be there for you, you know."

1184
01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:06,877
My God, you are so...corny.

1185
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,037
Trite, Tom, why?

1186
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:10,822
Tom! Tom! That's the navigator's name!

1187
01:05:16,068 --> 01:05:17,068
Tell me.

1188
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:19,851
Is this about London?

1189
01:05:21,577 --> 01:05:22,925
Because of a lot of things...

1190
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:25,600
I'm not sure about a lot of things anymore, Tom.

1191
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:29,807
And I don't want to be held down by a relationship.

1192
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:30,982
Who's holding you?

1193
01:05:31,588 --> 01:05:32,588
Я?

1194
01:05:33,211 --> 01:05:34,211
Id.

1195
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:38,031
And I'm sorry I kept you for ten years
in this shitty town.

1196
01:05:38,114 --> 01:05:39,917
It's called ambition, Tom.

1197
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,074
You don't know what it is.

1198
01:05:41,748 --> 01:05:43,851
Too bad, I thought you'd understand,

1199
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:46,597
But I guess not.

1200
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:48,868
You're leaving me, what's there to understand?

1201
01:05:50,030 --> 01:05:51,188
That I feel bad, too.

1202
01:05:51,730 --> 01:05:53,939
If you want, I'll caress you, huh?

1203
01:05:54,022 --> 01:05:55,327
Do you want a caress?

1204
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:56,548
Don't be a child.

1205
01:05:57,390 --> 01:05:58,648
You don't get it.

1206
01:05:58,731 --> 01:06:00,114
I never understand anything.

1207
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:03,797
You always understand everything,
and the rest of the world doesn't.

1208
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:06,914
You know, my friends can't stand you,
and you haven't even noticed?

1209
01:06:07,668 --> 01:06:09,717
Get off your heels once in a while

1210
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:12,251
and ask what people really think of you.

1211
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:14,737
I don't get it.

1212
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:17,451
You know... fine.

1213
01:06:19,554 --> 01:06:20,765
- Tommaso...
- Zoya.

1214
01:06:23,817 --> 01:06:24,868
Go to hell.

1215
01:07:07,370 --> 01:07:09,208
- Hey.
- How's it going? Everything okay?

1216
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:10,291
Yes.

1217
01:07:10,742 --> 01:07:12,257
I'll stay with you for a few days.

1218
01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:13,340
Uh, sure.

1219
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:16,308
Got any wine?

1220
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:19,048
At 1:30 in the morning?

1221
01:07:19,131 --> 01:07:20,131
What are we drinking to?

1222
01:07:20,550 --> 01:07:21,828
To my promotion.

1223
01:07:22,411 --> 01:07:23,411
Assigned?

1224
01:07:24,530 --> 01:07:25,817
They'll announce it tomorrow.

1225
01:07:26,620 --> 01:07:28,217
Is it possible to celebrate earlier?

1226
01:07:29,350 --> 01:07:31,097
No, no, I'm not superstitious.

1227
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:37,977
I left Tommaso.

1228
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:52,968
TOMMASO ROSSO
"MEANS NEVER"

1229
01:07:53,051 --> 01:07:55,980
"TOUCHING FINALE"

1230
01:07:56,891 --> 01:07:58,237
No tears.

1231
01:07:58,320 --> 01:07:59,320
It happens.

1232
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:01,920
It's in the nature of things.

1233
01:08:03,085 --> 01:08:04,971
You change and you make choices.

1234
01:08:05,870 --> 01:08:07,947
And when you break up, the one who leaves,

1235
01:08:08,030 --> 01:08:10,008
and has to give explanations.

1236
01:08:10,091 --> 01:08:11,091
I know,

1237
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:13,782
but that's the kind of rhetoric that means.

1238
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:15,462
I won't.

1239
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,587
On the contrary, I'll smile.

1240
01:08:18,670 --> 01:08:19,805
Let's do it the other way around.

1241
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:21,931
You tell me.

1242
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:26,037
I want to know
what you think of me, the truth.

1243
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:27,317
Without any pathos.

1244
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:29,120
Don't worry, I can't fire you.

1245
01:08:29,870 --> 01:08:30,870
Nina?

1246
01:08:31,290 --> 01:08:33,611
No, nothing comes to mind.

1247
01:08:34,530 --> 01:08:35,530
Virginia?

1248
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:38,640
Marco?

1249
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:41,520
Okay, I don't insist.

1250
01:08:42,090 --> 01:08:44,922
Ah, Nina, it came to me in the general newsletter:

1251
01:08:45,005 --> 01:08:47,177
"There's a corporate party tonight."

1252
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:48,922
What's going to happen tonight?

1253
01:08:49,005 --> 01:08:52,305
Well, it's a party at the same establishment.....

1254
01:08:52,388 --> 01:08:53,851
It came to you by mistake.

1255
01:08:54,990 --> 01:08:57,485
If you come over, we can have a drink together.

1256
01:08:58,550 --> 01:09:00,387
- A drink?
- Why don't you--

1257
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:01,737
Well done, Tommaso.

1258
01:09:04,148 --> 01:09:06,537
Bad news always comes in pairs.

1259
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:08,947
Okay, this is for her.

1260
01:09:09,030 --> 01:09:10,971
Give it to her when she comes to get her stuff.

1261
01:09:11,710 --> 01:09:14,454
- Anyway, Tommaso, I've read it.
- Yes.

1262
01:09:14,537 --> 01:09:15,714
Shall I tell you the truth?

1263
01:09:16,217 --> 01:09:17,927
It's kind of boring,

1264
01:09:18,010 --> 01:09:20,948
except for the finale, which is just good!

1265
01:09:22,350 --> 01:09:24,357
Since you're here, will you have lunch with us?

1266
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:27,187
Friday, Maria is making onion soup.

1267
01:09:27,270 --> 01:09:30,751
Yeah, thanks, but it's, uh.
not exactly my favorite dish.

1268
01:09:30,834 --> 01:09:32,137
And it's not mine.

1269
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:35,097
What's more, it disgusts me.

1270
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:37,457
But she's been brewing it since
since we got engaged.

1271
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:40,087
And I haven't dared to tell her that since 1969,

1272
01:09:40,170 --> 01:09:43,325
and now I have to pay that tax for 50 years.

1273
01:09:53,302 --> 01:09:55,347
I escaped, the guards didn't see me.

1274
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:57,597
Suddenly I wanted to see you like I used to,

1275
01:09:57,680 --> 01:09:58,742
alone with you.

1276
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:01,897
And I missed that car.

1277
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:05,828
It's without an accelerant, if we get caught,
you'll lose six or seven percent of the vote.

1278
01:10:07,577 --> 01:10:08,674
Do you remember when...

1279
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:12,354
When we drove it to Turin
to the De André concert?

1280
01:10:13,005 --> 01:10:15,337
September 18, 1991.

1281
01:10:16,445 --> 01:10:18,080
I got sick on the first song.

1282
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:22,788
I've always loved you,

1283
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:26,347
I never loved you...

1284
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:29,077
Love comes.

1285
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:31,131
Love is gone.

1286
01:10:32,342 --> 01:10:34,785
Okay, Héléna, don't cry.

1287
01:10:34,868 --> 01:10:36,640
It's a complicated situation as it is.

1288
01:10:37,290 --> 01:10:38,880
I tried, I really did.

1289
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,977
But lately.
I've been missing the situation, completely.

1290
01:10:45,290 --> 01:10:49,302
I'm a terrible wife, my mom and the mayor too.

1291
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,117
- Terrible.
- That's not true.

1292
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:52,605
That's not true, you're a great mayor.

1293
01:10:55,290 --> 01:10:58,125
Umberto, please come to your senses.

1294
01:10:58,708 --> 01:10:59,997
Come back.

1295
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,567
But you're the one who has to go back.

1296
01:11:02,650 --> 01:11:03,771
To be Helena again,

1297
01:11:04,308 --> 01:11:06,067
not just our mayor.

1298
01:11:06,150 --> 01:11:09,074
Not to register marriages,
but taking care of your own.

1299
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:13,327
If that's the way you think it is,
it's old-fashioned male chauvinism,

1300
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:15,577
which doesn't do you any honor. It's not you, no.

1301
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:18,605
Helena, don't campaign,
I'll vote for you anyway.

1302
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:22,517
If you're worried about how it's gonna be perceived,
no one will ever know.

1303
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:25,737
If I miss a couple of formal dinners,
you'll be better off.

1304
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:27,862
Héléna, Héléna...

1305
01:11:29,554 --> 01:11:31,211
- Sweetheart.
- Listen to me.

1306
01:11:38,285 --> 01:11:39,722
No more pictures,

1307
01:11:39,805 --> 01:11:41,005
enough security,

1308
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:42,742
enough of City Hall.

1309
01:11:44,605 --> 01:11:45,748
It's blackmail.

1310
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:49,691
You don't understand...

1311
01:11:51,462 --> 01:11:52,960
You're the one who doesn't understand.

1312
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:58,300
Here you go.

1313
01:12:01,570 --> 01:12:03,337
Thank you, Mrs. Maria.

1314
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:05,247
- I left my keys in the office.
- Why?

1315
01:12:05,330 --> 01:12:07,120
Tommaso left them for me on purpose.

1316
01:12:08,834 --> 01:12:11,257
So you're going to London?

1317
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:12,960
Yes.

1318
01:12:14,182 --> 01:12:15,767
Are you happy?

1319
01:12:15,850 --> 01:12:16,917
You'll see the queen.

1320
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,447
Yes, I'm very happy.

1321
01:12:18,530 --> 01:12:20,687
Wouldn't miss the pope.....

1322
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:23,208
Well, you're gonna miss your daddy.

1323
01:12:23,291 --> 01:12:26,077
Look, you come to us

1324
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:27,760
for the golden wedding tomorrow?

1325
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:29,337
I don't think I can.

1326
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:30,807
I have meetings at work.

1327
01:12:30,890 --> 01:12:33,437
Come on, we keep it simple,
out here in the yard.

1328
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:34,888
By the way, we have to hurry.

1329
01:12:34,971 --> 01:12:36,877
Time to make onion soup.

1330
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,387
I love onion soup.

1331
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:41,257
Fifty years Franco's been asking me for it!

1332
01:12:41,810 --> 01:12:43,087
Ever since we met,

1333
01:12:43,170 --> 01:12:46,297
and I don't know how to tell him
that this soup disgusts me.

1334
01:12:47,330 --> 01:12:50,168
You should see how much he loves him!

1335
01:12:50,251 --> 01:12:52,845
Fifty years of onion soup?

1336
01:12:55,051 --> 01:12:56,887
I took it with food.

1337
01:12:56,970 --> 01:12:58,137
Gotta go, bye!

1338
01:12:58,700 --> 01:12:59,700
Bye.

1339
01:13:08,514 --> 01:13:09,514
I broke up with him.

1340
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:12,605
I wish I could tell you
what it was like.

1341
01:13:17,645 --> 01:13:21,131
Why don't you fuck--

1342
01:13:27,660 --> 01:13:29,600
I feel good about it.

1343
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:32,982
Do you want to do it tonight?

1344
01:13:33,817 --> 01:13:35,474
We have an adjourned meeting.

1345
01:13:36,937 --> 01:13:38,982
Don't write to me ever again.

1346
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,137
Sorry, I'm really busy.

1347
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:49,108
Okay, have a good night.

1348
01:13:49,805 --> 01:13:53,348
AND TO YOU, MY LOVE.

1349
01:13:56,380 --> 01:13:59,257
AND YOU.

1350
01:14:03,980 --> 01:14:05,908
- Esther?
- What is it?

1351
01:14:06,731 --> 01:14:09,987
- Do you want to go out tonight?
- Abel has a fever.

1352
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:11,607
I guess it's no big deal.

1353
01:14:11,690 --> 01:14:14,320
- Flavio's not home.
- Can't you get a babysitter?

1354
01:14:15,110 --> 01:14:16,967
I could, but I don't want to.

1355
01:14:17,050 --> 01:14:19,219
When Abel has a fever,
I want to be there for him.

1356
01:14:19,302 --> 01:14:20,302
That's right.

1357
01:14:21,348 --> 01:14:23,577
Mom, I think I'm gonna throw up.

1358
01:14:24,310 --> 01:14:25,577
Exactly.

1359
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:28,548
Then mom's probably
have to hold your head.

1360
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:31,611
Come on, come on.

1361
01:14:38,530 --> 01:14:40,411
Call Nina, the assistant.

1362
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:50,417
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to tell you
that the car's a little--

1363
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:51,622
No problem.

1364
01:14:52,788 --> 01:14:53,788
It's fun.

1365
01:14:54,731 --> 01:14:56,891
Yeah, especially if we get pulled over.

1366
01:15:00,651 --> 01:15:01,817
Wait, wait, wait!

1367
01:15:24,297 --> 01:15:25,297
Let's go.

1368
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:27,645
We're in for an unforgettable evening.

1369
01:15:28,450 --> 01:15:30,982
- Are you sure?
- Dad, it's a one-unit difference.

1370
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:35,777
Guys, that's a record: 57 points.

1371
01:15:35,860 --> 01:15:36,902
Wow...

1372
01:15:38,102 --> 01:15:39,037
Thank you.

1373
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:42,307
Always a great team effort
with this giant.

1374
01:15:42,390 --> 01:15:43,267
Honey!

1375
01:15:43,350 --> 01:15:45,157
We deserve an aperitif, don't we?

1376
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:46,317
You know the way.

1377
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:49,497
I'm jealous. It's a genius idea--
barley coffee tiramisu.

1378
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:51,407
The idea was pretty stupid,

1379
01:15:51,490 --> 01:15:53,147
but it was good, right?

1380
01:15:53,230 --> 01:15:55,397
Well, guys, I gotta go, Matilda's tired.

1381
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:58,187
When he says that,
it means he's tired.

1382
01:15:58,270 --> 01:15:59,977
Listen, what about Héléna?

1383
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:01,508
Who, the mayor?

1384
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:04,308
We're meeting at home,
"good morning," "good evening."

1385
01:16:05,291 --> 01:16:07,874
- Uh, Zoya? Have you guys been in touch?
- Uh, no.

1386
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:11,562
Maybe I should tell her I'm Marquez.

1387
01:16:11,645 --> 01:16:12,877
No, no, don't.

1388
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,102
What was, was.

1389
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,899
Did Dostoyevsky's idiot
become a hero at the end?

1390
01:16:16,982 --> 01:16:18,197
No.

1391
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:20,537
Did you do something stupid, act like a coward?

1392
01:16:21,245 --> 01:16:22,628
Well, and be a coward to the end.

1393
01:16:23,165 --> 01:16:24,165
Matilda, come on.

1394
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:25,907
Jacket, bye-bye, let's go!

1395
01:16:25,990 --> 01:16:26,990
- Bye, baby.
- Bye!

1396
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:28,437
- Bye.
- Bye!

1397
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:32,019
Hey, this couples contest idea is awesome!

1398
01:16:32,102 --> 01:16:33,907
For years now, we've been like this...

1399
01:16:33,990 --> 01:16:36,000
I'm a good cook,
next time we'll be on the team.

1400
01:16:38,228 --> 01:16:39,657
- Aperitif?
- Two.

1401
01:16:41,017 --> 01:16:44,037
Guys, the next time
you want to introduce me to someone,

1402
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:45,547
please give me a heads-up.

1403
01:16:45,630 --> 01:16:47,585
Ever since you came
to the barbershop for a shave,

1404
01:16:47,668 --> 01:16:49,147
she's always asking about you.

1405
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:50,647
Honey, have fun!

1406
01:16:50,730 --> 01:16:53,857
She says she gives massages with lard.
Where'd you get her?

1407
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:55,177
Come on, Tom, relax.....

1408
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:57,207
Don't call me "Tom," please.

1409
01:16:57,290 --> 01:16:58,179
You, too.

1410
01:16:58,262 --> 01:17:00,457
All right, guys,
the cafeteria's closed, go in peace.

1411
01:17:00,540 --> 01:17:03,367
I have an order for 30 people for tomorrow,
and I have to clean up.

1412
01:17:03,450 --> 01:17:05,237
You don't deserve it, but we'll help you out, okay....

1413
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:06,400
- Come on!
- Yeah, come on.

1414
01:17:07,371 --> 01:17:08,662
Do you need a ride home?

1415
01:17:09,657 --> 01:17:10,657
Yes.

1416
01:17:10,740 --> 01:17:12,274
Come on, sweetie, we'll help....

1417
01:17:37,531 --> 01:17:39,074
- Come on!
- One more!

1418
01:17:41,725 --> 01:17:44,677
- Excuse me, ma'am!
- Cheers, guys!

1419
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:47,611
- Let's go!
- Bottoms up!

1420
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:57,748
Come on, come on!

1421
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:01,440
I want to dance!

1422
01:18:06,868 --> 01:18:07,868
Nina!

1423
01:18:08,662 --> 01:18:11,120
Why didn't you want to answer me?

1424
01:18:12,948 --> 01:18:14,994
I know how to listen to criticism....

1425
01:18:15,850 --> 01:18:18,857
- What are you celebrating?
- Your departure.

1426
01:18:19,977 --> 01:18:20,977
What?

1427
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:24,099
Just because you're leaving!

1428
01:18:24,182 --> 01:18:27,942
Going to work every day
with fear is not a gift!

1429
01:18:31,897 --> 01:18:34,157
Does anyone else have anything else to say?

1430
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:35,988
I don't know how to tell you,

1431
01:18:36,660 --> 01:18:38,640
but you're a bitch.

1432
01:18:40,354 --> 01:18:44,267
Sure, you're the boss,
but a smile once in a while?

1433
01:18:44,350 --> 01:18:46,007
What the fuck...

1434
01:18:46,090 --> 01:18:48,582
Yeah, but at least we
learned how to say "100 yen."

1435
01:18:51,702 --> 01:18:52,757
All right?

1436
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:54,305
"Nina.

1437
01:18:54,388 --> 01:18:57,962
do you know why, in 1978.

1438
01:18:58,045 --> 01:19:01,437
didn't have 100 yen coins?"

1439
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,325
"Space Invaders!"

1440
01:19:28,011 --> 01:19:29,577
Are you Zoya, Nina's boss?

1441
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:33,280
Did she tell you I'm a bitch?

1442
01:19:34,422 --> 01:19:35,422
No.

1443
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:40,047
- She said you're going to London.
- It's true, I'm going to London.

1444
01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:43,007
London is the best of the best.

1445
01:19:43,090 --> 01:19:44,887
London is better, really. It's beautiful.

1446
01:19:44,970 --> 01:19:47,142
No, no, no, it's not better.

1447
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:50,087
No, it's better. Right?

1448
01:19:50,170 --> 01:19:53,268
If I give up everything,
it's got to be better, right?

1449
01:19:54,651 --> 01:19:55,651
I don't know.

1450
01:19:56,550 --> 01:19:57,550
We're leaving.

1451
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,062
Can I take you home?

1452
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:01,451
I can take you.

1453
01:20:02,891 --> 01:20:03,907
Thank you.

1454
01:20:03,990 --> 01:20:07,139
Madonna, what a nice house! It's huge!

1455
01:20:07,222 --> 01:20:09,717
- Congratulations.
- It's not mine.

1456
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:10,800
I'm taking it off.

1457
01:20:10,834 --> 01:20:13,067
And I have to move out,
because my ex-wife, uh.

1458
01:20:13,150 --> 01:20:15,727
My former... partner terminated her contract.

1459
01:20:15,810 --> 01:20:19,517
Yes, Gianni told me something
that she left because she was going to London.

1460
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:21,677
Well, it's a little more complicated than that....

1461
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,880
She...

1462
01:20:23,497 --> 01:20:26,257
became a senior manager
for a major European company.

1463
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:27,340
"Senior Manager"?

1464
01:20:27,370 --> 01:20:29,127
What kind of job? I've never heard of it.

1465
01:20:29,210 --> 01:20:31,542
So, the supervisor...

1466
01:20:33,510 --> 01:20:36,437
You know that game where you have
your own avatar?

1467
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:39,040
No, I like other games.

1468
01:20:42,788 --> 01:20:45,574
And so, dear friends of the night,
we are back on the air...

1469
01:20:45,657 --> 01:20:46,657
Hey!

1470
01:20:47,874 --> 01:20:48,874
Where do I go?

1471
01:20:49,325 --> 01:20:55,368
Piazza Campitelli, 20.

1472
01:20:55,451 --> 01:20:56,731
- Okay?
- All right.

1473
01:21:05,234 --> 01:21:07,427
- Stop, no.
- Boom, boom, that one's over, too.

1474
01:21:07,510 --> 01:21:09,287
- That's enough.
- Another bottle.

1475
01:21:09,370 --> 01:21:10,597
I don't.

1476
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:12,127
- Yeah, yeah.
- Stop, no, stop.

1477
01:21:12,210 --> 01:21:14,514
- That was fast!
- Whoa!

1478
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:16,480
Zoya...

1479
01:21:17,497 --> 01:21:20,547
- Am I in the wrong house?
- What are you doing here?

1480
01:21:20,630 --> 01:21:23,187
You brought her to our house?

1481
01:21:23,270 --> 01:21:25,085
This isn't our home anymore.

1482
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:28,171
That's the head of the company?

1483
01:21:29,170 --> 01:21:31,474
Who's the boy? Little brother?

1484
01:21:32,034 --> 01:21:33,347
Where'd you get that whore?

1485
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:35,067
Hey, señorita, fuck you!

1486
01:21:35,150 --> 01:21:36,287
Hey, hey, calm down.

1487
01:21:36,370 --> 01:21:38,251
Everyone...everyone calm down, all of us.

1488
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:41,482
I'm sorry, did you come here to fuck
with this young man in our house?

1489
01:21:41,565 --> 01:21:43,405
This isn't our home anymore.

1490
01:21:44,068 --> 01:21:45,817
And I'm not a youngster, I'm 22 years old.

1491
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:46,997
What about you?

1492
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:50,102
What were you doing with that...award?

1493
01:21:53,497 --> 01:21:55,987
I don't have to answer
to you about what I'm doing.

1494
01:21:56,070 --> 01:21:59,645
Okay, but I thought
you had better taste, let's say.

1495
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:03,997
And I thought you had a taste
"a little more mature, shall we say.

1496
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:05,645
Again! I'm an adult.

1497
01:22:09,462 --> 01:22:10,525
Hello, Mom?

1498
01:22:11,805 --> 01:22:14,727
No, I was giving a ride home to a lady
who wasn't feeling well.

1499
01:22:14,810 --> 01:22:15,810
And now I'm now...

1500
01:22:15,885 --> 01:22:18,297
Look at me... "lady"!

1501
01:22:22,180 --> 01:22:23,677
- Why?
- I apologize.

1502
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:26,488
- You're drunk.
- You're an idiot and a moron.

1503
01:22:26,571 --> 01:22:29,257
- You're very drunk.
- You're very stupid.

1504
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:30,717
I don't understand you.

1505
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:31,817
Let's go, come on!

1506
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:35,348
Or I'll have to scratch someone here!

1507
01:22:36,770 --> 01:22:37,791
Congratulations!

1508
01:22:37,874 --> 01:22:40,967
It's good to talk about this nerd all evening!

1509
01:22:41,050 --> 01:22:42,937
You know what? You deserve her.

1510
01:22:43,657 --> 01:22:45,082
And you're coming with me.

1511
01:22:45,165 --> 01:22:46,165
Bye!

1512
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:49,268
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

1513
01:22:54,890 --> 01:22:56,422
Zoya, no.

1514
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:58,127
Stop drinking.

1515
01:22:58,210 --> 01:23:01,074
Hey, no, no, no, no, no.

1516
01:23:02,890 --> 01:23:04,047
That's enough.

1517
01:23:04,130 --> 01:23:05,130
Tom...

1518
01:23:06,114 --> 01:23:07,630
I'm not feeling well.

1519
01:23:09,028 --> 01:23:10,285
I feel bad, too.

1520
01:23:10,971 --> 01:23:12,579
No...

1521
01:23:12,662 --> 01:23:14,091
I'm not feeling well,

1522
01:23:14,780 --> 01:23:17,577
because I've been drinking...a lot.

1523
01:23:19,645 --> 01:23:21,268
I thought that...

1524
01:24:17,794 --> 01:24:22,830
Template Template Template.

1525
01:24:23,931 --> 01:24:25,807
Fucking exes.

1526
01:24:25,890 --> 01:24:28,240
Plus the fact that it was awesome!

1527
01:24:29,420 --> 01:24:30,420
And now?

1528
01:24:32,020 --> 01:24:33,085
What's gonna happen?

1529
01:24:34,610 --> 01:24:35,610
Look...

1530
01:24:47,390 --> 01:24:49,817
"Hi, my name is Zoé,

1531
01:24:50,434 --> 01:24:51,782
I'm ten years old,

1532
01:24:52,457 --> 01:24:53,942
and I like video games.

1533
01:24:57,260 --> 01:25:00,587
Today my dad explained to me
that nothing is created,

1534
01:25:00,670 --> 01:25:03,851
nothing is destroyed, everything is transformed.

1535
01:25:04,674 --> 01:25:06,057
He said that mom...

1536
01:25:07,382 --> 01:25:09,137
looks like a cloud.

1537
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:10,397
When it's cold,

1538
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:13,702
the vapor in the clouds turns to snow,

1539
01:25:14,251 --> 01:25:17,167
and when it's hot,
it turns to water and it rains.

1540
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:19,207
And then the sun comes out again,

1541
01:25:19,290 --> 01:25:21,622
everything warms up, even the puddles.

1542
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:25,920
The water turns to vapor and flies into the sky,

1543
01:25:26,770 --> 01:25:28,880
becomes a cloud again, as it was before."

1544
01:25:30,582 --> 01:25:32,037
Dad wanted to tell me,

1545
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:35,154
that mom would somehow be back soon.

1546
01:25:37,460 --> 01:25:38,460
And here we go,

1547
01:25:39,142 --> 01:25:40,142
favorite,

1548
01:25:41,108 --> 01:25:44,217
a breakup after many years
should be something like this, no?

1549
01:25:45,550 --> 01:25:46,857
Don't collapse,

1550
01:25:47,900 --> 01:25:49,165
but to change.

1551
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:51,508
But I didn't want to change.

1552
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:54,114
You did it all.

1553
01:26:01,234 --> 01:26:02,697
It happens, Tommaso.

1554
01:26:03,590 --> 01:26:05,037
It happens, that's all.

1555
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:06,767
It's nobody's fault.

1556
01:26:06,850 --> 01:26:07,850
It's raining,

1557
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:10,257
you get wet and dry,

1558
01:26:10,340 --> 01:26:11,508
and it's raining again.

1559
01:26:12,582 --> 01:26:14,571
The only thing that can be done is.

1560
01:26:17,017 --> 01:26:18,434
open the umbrella.

1561
01:26:31,577 --> 01:26:32,577
Bye.

1562
01:26:35,851 --> 01:26:36,851
- We'll talk.
- Uh, okay.

1563
01:26:36,930 --> 01:26:38,374
- Uh, okay?
- I'll, uh, I'll call you.

1564
01:26:38,457 --> 01:26:39,297
Uh, sure.

1565
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:41,208
I can't believe it!

1566
01:26:41,291 --> 01:26:42,648
You're here, thank you!

1567
01:26:42,731 --> 01:26:44,797
Thank you, I wasn't expecting it, and I'm so glad I did!

1568
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:46,147
Maria will be even more pleased.

1569
01:26:46,230 --> 01:26:47,967
- Come in, have some...
- No, Franco.

1570
01:26:48,050 --> 01:26:49,277
- Five minutes!
- Thank you.

1571
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:51,167
Five minutes, and then you're on your way. Come on in!

1572
01:26:51,250 --> 01:26:52,250
Maria!

1573
01:26:54,070 --> 01:26:57,047
Maria, look,
who came to congratulate us!

1574
01:26:57,130 --> 01:26:59,967
Oh, how nice! You guys are so cute!

1575
01:27:00,050 --> 01:27:02,077
So you came together? That's good news!

1576
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:04,867
No, no, no, we just, uh.
came by to congratulate you, and, uh.

1577
01:27:04,950 --> 01:27:05,988
And we'll go right away.

1578
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:08,477
- Come on, let's go cut the cake.
- Yeah.

1579
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:10,467
How elegant you are!

1580
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:11,550
What's your name?

1581
01:27:11,611 --> 01:27:13,087
Zoé, Mrs. Rachele.

1582
01:27:13,170 --> 01:27:14,837
Welcome, Zoe.

1583
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:17,459
Unless you have a date for tonight,

1584
01:27:17,542 --> 01:27:20,088
I can introduce you to this young man.

1585
01:27:20,171 --> 01:27:21,457
Nice to meet you, Tommaso.

1586
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:23,974
- Zoe.
- What sign are you?

1587
01:27:24,057 --> 01:27:25,327
- Both Taurus.
- Both Taurus.

1588
01:27:25,410 --> 01:27:26,410
Signora Rachele, we...

1589
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:30,087
- Mom, leave them alone.
- What a beautiful couple you are!

1590
01:27:30,170 --> 01:27:31,577
All right, I better go.

1591
01:27:31,660 --> 01:27:34,477
Yeah, go on, the kid'll be out of school soon.

1592
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,365
At least he doesn't have to pay.

1593
01:27:43,142 --> 01:27:44,907
You're such a bitch!

1594
01:27:44,990 --> 01:27:46,194
You started it.

1595
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,117
How's it going with the book?

1596
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:50,200
Well...

1597
01:27:50,262 --> 01:27:52,240
It's for sale, they'll make a new contract with me.

1598
01:27:53,862 --> 01:27:56,237
- You didn't tell me that.
- What?

1599
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:57,537
"Bitch."

1600
01:27:57,620 --> 01:27:58,899
In ten years.

1601
01:27:58,982 --> 01:27:59,982
No.

1602
01:28:00,030 --> 01:28:02,045
Obviously, for ten years I didn't think so.

1603
01:28:04,662 --> 01:28:06,525
You know what I've realized these days?

1604
01:28:07,462 --> 01:28:09,917
That we never really fought.

1605
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,907
Not once in ten years.

1606
01:28:11,990 --> 01:28:13,828
We never threw plates.

1607
01:28:14,628 --> 01:28:15,851
Everything was...

1608
01:28:16,514 --> 01:28:17,937
so peacefully.

1609
01:28:18,020 --> 01:28:21,857
We avoided arguments, didn't tell the whole truth.

1610
01:28:21,940 --> 01:28:25,951
The truth is a little dangerous, Zoe.

1611
01:28:26,034 --> 01:28:27,302
Sometimes you need it,

1612
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:29,005
even though it hurts.

1613
01:28:29,810 --> 01:28:30,845
You cheated on me?

1614
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:38,080
- What about you?
- Yeah.

1615
01:28:45,622 --> 01:28:47,634
What can I say? It happened.

1616
01:28:48,205 --> 01:28:49,205
Amen.

1617
01:28:50,217 --> 01:28:51,640
"It happened, amen."

1618
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:55,394
I'll get you a drink.

1619
01:28:57,330 --> 01:28:58,330
All right. Uh-huh.

1620
01:29:12,834 --> 01:29:15,517
Daughter, let's get
clothes for tomorrow so we won't be late.

1621
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:18,205
It's ready, my mom already made it this afternoon.

1622
01:29:19,131 --> 01:29:21,360
So, tell me, what do you want for breakfast?

1623
01:29:22,262 --> 01:29:24,160
Mom had already put it in her briefcase.

1624
01:29:25,954 --> 01:29:28,065
Daddy, Mommy... says,

1625
01:29:28,148 --> 01:29:31,074
that when I grow up,
I need a husband like you.

1626
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:33,827
Mom always gives the best advice.

1627
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:37,885
Well, Dad, it's okay,
Mom wants to be chairman of the board.

1628
01:29:39,611 --> 01:29:42,837
Hey, two minutes, then turn off the light and go to sleep.

1629
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:44,457
- Good night.
- Good night.

1630
01:29:46,670 --> 01:29:47,737
I thought.

1631
01:29:50,308 --> 01:29:51,308
You're right.

1632
01:29:52,091 --> 01:29:53,470
You come first.

1633
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:56,468
I'm resigning.

1634
01:30:01,410 --> 01:30:02,410
Good night.

1635
01:30:14,530 --> 01:30:16,177
CHAPTER SIX: LASCIARE

1636
01:30:16,260 --> 01:30:18,968
THE MEANING OF THE WORD "LEAVE" IS
WALK AWAY FROM SOMEONE OR SOMETHING

1637
01:30:19,051 --> 01:30:20,757
EXAMPLE: I HAVE TO LEAVE YOU

1638
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:22,497
OR: LEAVE SELECTION.

1639
01:30:22,580 --> 01:30:25,017
TAKE-IT-OR-LEAVE-IT

1640
01:30:29,890 --> 01:30:30,890
- Here.
- Thank you.

1641
01:30:32,050 --> 01:30:33,608
- Are you done?
- I am.

1642
01:30:33,691 --> 01:30:35,714
- Go brush your teeth with your dad.
- (sighs) Okay.

1643
01:30:38,180 --> 01:30:40,214
Maybe I left him for nothing.

1644
01:30:40,297 --> 01:30:41,297
Do you miss him?

1645
01:30:42,811 --> 01:30:45,867
Maybe you miss living with him
these ten years?

1646
01:30:45,950 --> 01:30:47,977
Shared friends, habits...

1647
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:49,717
That's normal.

1648
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:53,057
Breaking up after all these years
is also a way out of--

1649
01:30:53,140 --> 01:30:54,842
from the community.

1650
01:30:54,925 --> 01:30:56,187
Think of London, Zoe.

1651
01:30:56,270 --> 01:30:57,588
It's what you've always wanted.

1652
01:31:00,540 --> 01:31:02,868
I started chatting with a stranger.

1653
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:05,657
He confused me even more.

1654
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:07,597
Absurd,

1655
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:09,668
but it's like he knows how I feel.

1656
01:31:10,445 --> 01:31:11,997
It's a long explanation.

1657
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:13,397
The thing is.

1658
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:14,708
I didn't tell Tom about it.

1659
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:17,337
He was honest with me.

1660
01:31:18,777 --> 01:31:19,877
I don't.

1661
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:21,037
So, uh.

1662
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:25,477
You're not married, you have no children,
and most importantly, you don't share a mortgage.

1663
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:26,937
You can choose,

1664
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:29,027
but you should have clarity.

1665
01:31:29,110 --> 01:31:32,217
And if there's something
to confess something to Tommaso, it better be now,

1666
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:33,474
before it's too late.

1667
01:31:35,725 --> 01:31:38,285
Thank you, thank you very much...

1668
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:42,362
- Thank you very much.
- Bye, thank you.

1669
01:31:42,445 --> 01:31:44,137
- Hey, what's your name?
- Desiree.

1670
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:46,765
- I'll read it right away.
- Thank you.

1671
01:31:48,068 --> 01:31:49,474
- And I'll need a signature.
- Bye.

1672
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:51,760
- Hey, what's your name?
- Stefano.

1673
01:31:51,820 --> 01:31:52,891
Stefano...

1674
01:31:56,530 --> 01:31:57,677
- Here you go.
- Thank you very much.

1675
01:31:57,760 --> 01:31:58,760
You're welcome.

1676
01:32:03,130 --> 01:32:05,074
- Who do you want me to sign it for?
- For Zoé.

1677
01:32:07,050 --> 01:32:08,594
I really enjoyed the book,

1678
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:11,588
although it does feel like the ending is unfair.

1679
01:32:12,190 --> 01:32:14,822
This ending isn't mine, it's the readers' ending.

1680
01:32:15,508 --> 01:32:17,131
What would your finale be?

1681
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:23,757
EVERYONE HAS THE ENDING
THAT THEY DESERVE

1682
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:24,840
TOMMASO

1683
01:32:42,190 --> 01:32:43,588
- Is everything okay?
- Uh, yeah, yeah.

1684
01:32:50,811 --> 01:32:52,027
I need to see you.

1685
01:32:52,110 --> 01:32:54,808
You're the only person
I can trust.

1686
01:32:54,891 --> 01:32:56,228
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1687
01:33:05,862 --> 01:33:06,979
Hi.

1688
01:33:07,062 --> 01:33:08,697
I'm sorry, I can't right now.

1689
01:33:08,780 --> 01:33:10,317
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1690
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:12,057
- Who do you want me to sign it for?
- Alessandro.

1691
01:33:16,468 --> 01:33:18,716
"THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE WORLD MORE COMPLICATED THAN LOVE"
GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUEZ

1692
01:33:18,740 --> 01:33:20,731
Write to me,
what you hate about him.

1693
01:33:30,297 --> 01:33:31,805
You faked an orgasm with me?

1694
01:33:34,411 --> 01:33:35,440
You cheated on him?

1695
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:43,960
Explain it to me.

1696
01:33:47,188 --> 01:33:48,967
What are you talking about, Zoya?

1697
01:33:49,050 --> 01:33:50,225
Are you serious?

1698
01:33:50,308 --> 01:33:53,307
I can't believe you actually did it.

1699
01:33:53,390 --> 01:33:54,837
Zoya, please, not now.

1700
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:56,477
"Not now"? "Not now"?

1701
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:59,188
You've been mocking me this whole time!

1702
01:33:59,702 --> 01:34:01,727
You're so short!

1703
01:34:01,810 --> 01:34:03,425
- Am I short?
- Uh, yeah.

1704
01:34:03,508 --> 01:34:06,847
And when you asked a magazine for advice
on how to dump me, isn't that low?

1705
01:34:06,930 --> 01:34:10,000
I've been hanging out with that guy,
so I wouldn't hurt you!

1706
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:14,308
I can't believe it. Are you crazy?

1707
01:34:14,810 --> 01:34:16,625
Why didn't you say what you were writing there?

1708
01:34:16,708 --> 01:34:17,867
- Why?
- "Why?"

1709
01:34:17,950 --> 01:34:19,211
- Yes.
- "Why?"

1710
01:34:21,737 --> 01:34:23,207
Didn't you realize?

1711
01:34:23,290 --> 01:34:24,454
It was the right thing to do!

1712
01:34:24,537 --> 01:34:26,545
I've learned more about us in a month
than I have in ten years.

1713
01:34:26,628 --> 01:34:29,128
You don't understand, Tommaso, you stole from me!

1714
01:34:29,211 --> 01:34:30,739
Now you're telling me "Tommaso"?

1715
01:34:30,822 --> 01:34:31,927
- Tell me, Zoe.
- Zoe.

1716
01:34:32,010 --> 01:34:33,448
- Zoe!
- Zoe, asshole!

1717
01:34:33,531 --> 01:34:35,139
You can't say my name!

1718
01:34:35,222 --> 01:34:37,686
You were aroused by texting with a John Doe,
who understands you.

1719
01:34:37,710 --> 01:34:39,871
Too bad, the one who's not like me,
the one you were flirting with,

1720
01:34:39,954 --> 01:34:42,297
kissing you in the morning
and throwing your hair all over the bathroom.

1721
01:34:42,380 --> 01:34:45,597
- You're a walrus dick!
- Oh, finally a reaction!

1722
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:48,127
Let's have a real fight,
since you haven't had enough!

1723
01:34:48,210 --> 01:34:50,522
Look, 200 people are looking at us, come on!

1724
01:34:50,605 --> 01:34:52,217
Don't overestimate yourself, Tommaso!

1725
01:34:52,300 --> 01:34:53,607
There are 40 of them.

1726
01:34:53,690 --> 01:34:56,011
That's a lot
for such literary crap!

1727
01:35:05,817 --> 01:35:07,387
Why didn't you tell those 40 poor people,

1728
01:35:07,470 --> 01:35:10,637
that while you were trying to leave me,
you wanted to cheat on me with who knows who?

1729
01:35:10,720 --> 01:35:13,687
That's not true, and let's not talk about cheating,
Tommaso, please!

1730
01:35:13,770 --> 01:35:16,179
- No, let's do it!
- You did it first!

1731
01:35:16,262 --> 01:35:17,822
Why didn't you say anything when you found out?

1732
01:35:17,897 --> 01:35:20,447
- It didn't matter.
- It didn't matter to you!

1733
01:35:20,530 --> 01:35:23,787
The only thing you cared about
was that our relationship go smoothly,

1734
01:35:23,870 --> 01:35:25,847
not interfere with your life, your career!

1735
01:35:25,930 --> 01:35:28,157
Zoya, Zoya, Zoya! There's only you!

1736
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:29,677
And that was important, Zoya!

1737
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:31,517
And fucking a guy in Tokyo is important, too,

1738
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:34,457
and you didn't have the guts to admit it,
even when I asked you!

1739
01:35:35,337 --> 01:35:37,047
- You know what's important?
- What?

1740
01:35:37,130 --> 01:35:39,977
That you were blind when our relationship
didn't work out for years,

1741
01:35:40,060 --> 01:35:42,407
that we were like friends
who occasionally fucked,

1742
01:35:42,490 --> 01:35:44,007
since it's protocol!

1743
01:35:44,090 --> 01:35:45,677
We could have talked about it!

1744
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:49,299
For two months we were cooped up in the house,
you've been writing these fucking emails for two months!

1745
01:35:49,382 --> 01:35:51,117
Why'd you do it, why'd you do it?

1746
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:52,240
- Why?
- Yes.

1747
01:35:53,154 --> 01:35:54,547
Look at me, Zoya.

1748
01:35:54,630 --> 01:35:55,920
Look how I'm dressed.

1749
01:35:56,430 --> 01:35:57,637
Look at me.

1750
01:35:57,720 --> 01:35:58,720
Even...

1751
01:35:58,777 --> 01:36:01,108
shitty ending to this book...

1752
01:36:01,634 --> 01:36:03,157
Who do you think he's for?

1753
01:36:03,240 --> 01:36:06,257
You should have had the courage to ask me,

1754
01:36:06,340 --> 01:36:07,647
not sneaking around.

1755
01:36:07,730 --> 01:36:10,117
- I was trying to ask you when you were!
- Of course I was!

1756
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:11,337
And when you weren't talking,

1757
01:36:11,420 --> 01:36:13,345
how perfect
"Space Invaders!

1758
01:36:13,428 --> 01:36:16,177
And what was so important
did you ask me, Tommaso?

1759
01:36:16,260 --> 01:36:18,227
Did you ask me if I wanted to get married?

1760
01:36:18,310 --> 01:36:20,907
Do I really want to buy a house with you,
do I want to have a baby?

1761
01:36:20,990 --> 01:36:22,031
Did you ask me?

1762
01:36:22,114 --> 01:36:24,537
Are you kidding me? You always said
that marriage is conditional,

1763
01:36:24,620 --> 01:36:25,677
that you don't want kids!

1764
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:28,491
- Did you ever ask me?
- Of course I asked you!

1765
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:30,899
But the only way
to show you something

1766
01:36:30,982 --> 01:36:32,705
to shove it up your virtual shit!

1767
01:36:32,788 --> 01:36:35,291
The only way I can show you
to show you something is to walk away from you!

1768
01:36:44,700 --> 01:36:47,005
I wonder what we've been doing all these years?

1769
01:36:50,365 --> 01:36:51,365
Nothing...

1770
01:36:52,060 --> 01:36:53,060
We...

1771
01:36:53,954 --> 01:36:55,108
had dinner at the restaurant.

1772
01:37:10,270 --> 01:37:13,677
- Tommaso, I need help.
- Umberto, please, not today.

1773
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:15,440
Today Héléna is resigning for me.

1774
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:18,277
- That's what you wanted, right?
- You're the one who said I wanted it.

1775
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:21,334
Don't you dare say that.
I was just giving advice, you did it yourself.

1776
01:37:21,417 --> 01:37:23,467
"When you build a wall,
remember what you leave on the outside."

1777
01:37:23,550 --> 01:37:26,187
- God, what is that, a horoscope?
- "Baron in the tree," you ignoramus.

1778
01:37:26,270 --> 01:37:29,207
Hey, Humberto, I got business today,
you're not the only one in the world, okay?

1779
01:37:29,290 --> 01:37:32,290
I built a wall and left Ellena outside,
and now I don't know how to stop her.

1780
01:37:32,370 --> 01:37:35,047
Now you're gonna come with me
and tell me you wrote it!

1781
01:37:35,130 --> 01:37:36,967
Slow down, today's not the day.

1782
01:37:37,050 --> 01:37:38,971
- But you have to help me!
- I'm sick of you!

1783
01:37:44,251 --> 01:37:45,394
What a blow!

1784
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:48,280
Come with me.

1785
01:37:49,314 --> 01:37:50,487
Where to?

1786
01:37:50,570 --> 01:37:52,445
To the hospital in case I broke your nose?

1787
01:37:54,530 --> 01:37:55,530
Let's go.

1788
01:37:58,217 --> 01:38:02,097
A press conference has been urgently called,
to be held at City Hall.

1789
01:38:02,180 --> 01:38:04,022
She recognized Marquez as me.

1790
01:38:05,780 --> 01:38:07,859
We threw all the plates and glasses
all the plates and glasses,

1791
01:38:07,942 --> 01:38:09,071
unbroken in ten years.

1792
01:38:09,154 --> 01:38:11,539
...Lately, our mayor hasn't....

1793
01:38:11,622 --> 01:38:13,702
Damn, it's hard to break up!

1794
01:38:14,914 --> 01:38:16,017
It's really hard.

1795
01:38:16,100 --> 01:38:19,277
...they never miss an opportunity
to criticize her work,

1796
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:22,007
as we can hear in this interview.

1797
01:38:22,090 --> 01:38:25,137
How can a woman
who can't bring her family together,

1798
01:38:25,220 --> 01:38:26,777
to rally the entire city of Rome?

1799
01:38:26,860 --> 01:38:28,160
I don't know, you tell me!

1800
01:38:28,830 --> 01:38:32,107
It was a statement by the secretary of the Party
of the New Italian Renaissance,

1801
01:38:32,190 --> 01:38:34,240
made a few minutes
before the conference began...

1802
01:38:42,605 --> 01:38:44,822
Umberto, where the hell are we?

1803
01:38:50,765 --> 01:38:51,765
But...

1804
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:53,474
There he is, she's here...

1805
01:39:07,210 --> 01:39:09,557
Hello, welcome, everyone.

1806
01:39:09,640 --> 01:39:10,651
Thank you for being here.

1807
01:39:11,154 --> 01:39:13,507
Without getting too personal,

1808
01:39:13,590 --> 01:39:17,779
I absolutely must
to take responsibility for the city,

1809
01:39:17,862 --> 01:39:20,419
who deserves 100% of my energy,

1810
01:39:20,502 --> 01:39:23,268
of my time and my devotion.

1811
01:39:24,230 --> 01:39:26,891
But the people I care about deserve the same.

1812
01:39:28,690 --> 01:39:29,690
So, uh,

1813
01:39:31,090 --> 01:39:33,954
Having discussed it with my party and....

1814
01:39:34,537 --> 01:39:35,777
and after...

1815
01:39:35,860 --> 01:39:37,957
a long discussion with my family....

1816
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:39,040
Wait!

1817
01:39:47,314 --> 01:39:50,605
I never believed that someone like you
could fall in love with someone like me.

1818
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:53,382
Remember what you were like when you were 25?

1819
01:39:54,630 --> 01:39:56,527
As beautiful as she is now.

1820
01:39:56,610 --> 01:39:58,347
And I was fat, too,

1821
01:39:58,430 --> 01:40:01,047
almost as fat as he is now.

1822
01:40:01,130 --> 01:40:03,794
So I thought:
"Okay, she's gonna leave me someday."

1823
01:40:04,590 --> 01:40:06,800
The more you grew, the fatter I got.

1824
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:11,057
I thought I was
an example of nonconformity for you,

1825
01:40:11,140 --> 01:40:13,887
to show that you're different.

1826
01:40:13,970 --> 01:40:17,557
But you married me, and I thought:
"Now she's gonna leave me."

1827
01:40:17,640 --> 01:40:21,097
Then Matilda was born,
and I thought, "He's going to quit now."

1828
01:40:21,657 --> 01:40:23,905
Then there's the secretary, the counselor,

1829
01:40:23,988 --> 01:40:25,587
and now head of the city of Rome.

1830
01:40:25,670 --> 01:40:28,911
And every time I thought, "She's going to leave me."

1831
01:40:28,994 --> 01:40:30,320
But since you didn't leave me,

1832
01:40:31,622 --> 01:40:33,097
I've decided to leave you on my own.

1833
01:40:34,171 --> 01:40:36,137
I exaggerated your shortcomings,

1834
01:40:36,220 --> 01:40:37,794
to justify your fear.

1835
01:40:39,005 --> 01:40:42,137
But instead of retreating,
I had to step forward:

1836
01:40:42,220 --> 01:40:43,220
to be with you.

1837
01:40:43,730 --> 01:40:47,317
I mean, millions of women in history
have done so, for centuries.

1838
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:49,637
And they had to do that,
they had no choice.

1839
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:51,167
Can I, a man,

1840
01:40:51,250 --> 01:40:54,308
to live like this for 20 years
or a couple terms in office?

1841
01:40:55,954 --> 01:40:57,028
I think so.

1842
01:40:58,285 --> 01:40:59,707
So, Héléna,

1843
01:40:59,790 --> 01:41:02,125
come home with this ribbon.

1844
01:41:09,817 --> 01:41:13,057
Usually after such a passionate speech.

1845
01:41:13,140 --> 01:41:15,448
the crowd stands up and, uh.

1846
01:41:15,531 --> 01:41:17,131
and applauds, but, uh.

1847
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:21,905
Get out of here now, please,
this is an official press conference,

1848
01:41:21,988 --> 01:41:23,428
not an American movie.

1849
01:41:25,211 --> 01:41:26,211
I'm sorry...

1850
01:41:35,565 --> 01:41:36,565
Uh, excuse me.

1851
01:41:37,382 --> 01:41:39,577
- What's going on?
- I don't understand.

1852
01:41:43,668 --> 01:41:44,668
Umberto!

1853
01:41:47,950 --> 01:41:49,028
Take off your glasses.

1854
01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:56,491
You were being disgusting, as usual.

1855
01:41:58,571 --> 01:42:00,091
But I recognize you now.

1856
01:42:08,971 --> 01:42:11,157
- I'll see you at dinner.
- What dinner?

1857
01:42:11,240 --> 01:42:13,747
It's gonna be a long time,
I'm gonna be asked a million questions.

1858
01:42:13,830 --> 01:42:15,897
Okay, we'll have breakfast together tomorrow.

1859
01:42:15,980 --> 01:42:17,459
No, I'll leave early tomorrow,

1860
01:42:17,542 --> 01:42:19,277
should be at the construction site of the third subway line.

1861
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:21,242
The work got up there, they found two amphorae.

1862
01:42:21,325 --> 01:42:23,057
That's a shame. Well, I'll see you when you get back.

1863
01:42:23,140 --> 01:42:25,497
And on Wednesday morning.
I'm driving to Brussels at dawn

1864
01:42:25,580 --> 01:42:27,737
on the Committee of European Capitals of Culture.

1865
01:42:27,820 --> 01:42:29,428
- I must--
- Save Rome, I know.

1866
01:42:30,045 --> 01:42:31,045
I'll give it a try.

1867
01:42:31,630 --> 01:42:32,630
I'll be waiting.

1868
01:42:33,234 --> 01:42:34,277
But!

1869
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:35,665
Dinner will get cold,

1870
01:42:35,748 --> 01:42:37,894
and Matilda and I will make a scene for you
a scene for being late,

1871
01:42:37,977 --> 01:42:40,917
and you're not gonna say anything,
because there's more of us.

1872
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:42,560
And at home, we're in charge.

1873
01:42:43,817 --> 01:42:44,817
Id.

1874
01:42:45,222 --> 01:42:47,062
I'll be in stiff opposition,

1875
01:42:47,610 --> 01:42:49,062
but responsibly!

1876
01:42:49,954 --> 01:42:51,447
- Smile.
- Why?

1877
01:42:51,530 --> 01:42:52,685
There are photographers here.

1878
01:42:58,240 --> 01:42:59,782
Nina, can you call, uh.

1879
01:43:07,710 --> 01:43:08,710
Tommaso?

1880
01:43:32,060 --> 01:43:33,637
Here's a new report.

1881
01:43:33,720 --> 01:43:35,680
Three percent, not six percent.

1882
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:39,345
Excuse us for just then.

1883
01:43:39,428 --> 01:43:42,068
And thanks from everyone for the bonus.

1884
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:45,699
It's a gift from us,

1885
01:43:45,782 --> 01:43:46,891
for good luck.

1886
01:43:47,668 --> 01:43:48,777
100 yen...

1887
01:43:50,125 --> 01:43:51,387
Thank you.

1888
01:43:51,470 --> 01:43:52,470
Come on.

1889
01:43:52,870 --> 01:43:55,627
Here's to the new senior manager
of the London branch.

1890
01:43:55,710 --> 01:43:56,710
Momentum.

1891
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:01,402
First, I want to hug each and every one of you,

1892
01:44:01,485 --> 01:44:02,571
bitches.

1893
01:44:12,182 --> 01:44:13,657
Now you know the whole story.

1894
01:44:13,740 --> 01:44:17,245
Mother of God, you were flirting
with Gabriel Garcia Marquez!

1895
01:44:18,020 --> 01:44:19,108
He took me...

1896
01:44:19,780 --> 01:44:21,619
He knew what to say, asshole!

1897
01:44:21,702 --> 01:44:22,702
You betcha!

1898
01:44:23,657 --> 01:44:26,948
So, basically.
you fell in love with Tommaso?

1899
01:44:28,020 --> 01:44:30,148
- He didn't choose the wine.
- What do you mean?

1900
01:44:31,965 --> 01:44:33,665
The first time we went out together,

1901
01:44:33,748 --> 01:44:35,287
we were at a wine bar.

1902
01:44:35,370 --> 01:44:37,965
Tommaso says to me:
"Take your pick, I don't care."

1903
01:44:38,697 --> 01:44:40,537
Never happened,

1904
01:44:40,620 --> 01:44:42,628
so a man doesn't pick out my wine.

1905
01:44:43,200 --> 01:44:45,367
Oddly enough, this one...

1906
01:44:45,450 --> 01:44:49,267
his relaxed nature
in any situation, I liked it.

1907
01:44:49,350 --> 01:44:51,379
Always in jeans, always in a sweatshirt,

1908
01:44:51,462 --> 01:44:53,357
even at your wedding, remember?

1909
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:55,905
How will I forget? He ruined all the pictures.

1910
01:44:55,988 --> 01:44:57,937
And the way he said my name:

1911
01:44:58,020 --> 01:45:00,205
"N-Zoya, N-Zoya..."

1912
01:45:02,297 --> 01:45:03,725
It was horrible...

1913
01:45:05,462 --> 01:45:06,817
But it made me happy.

1914
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:09,414
Zoé, you know, that's exactly what it is,

1915
01:45:09,497 --> 01:45:11,188
that you hated about him.

1916
01:45:26,731 --> 01:45:28,077
Hey, Marquez.

1917
01:45:28,160 --> 01:45:30,437
I wanted to ask you
one last favor.

1918
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:31,874
I'd like to see Tommaso.

1919
01:45:32,450 --> 01:45:35,691
Where we met, on the Sisto Bridge.

1920
01:45:36,182 --> 01:45:37,542
It's our anniversary.

1921
01:45:38,251 --> 01:45:39,251
Am I right?

1922
01:45:44,331 --> 01:45:46,137
It's not about whether you're right or wrong.

1923
01:45:46,994 --> 01:45:48,651
I don't know if he'll agree.

1924
01:46:53,190 --> 01:46:54,437
Did you pack a suitcase?

1925
01:46:54,520 --> 01:46:55,520
The essentials.

1926
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:58,207
I don't like to bring a lot of stuff with me.

1927
01:46:58,290 --> 01:46:59,290
I know.

1928
01:47:00,440 --> 01:47:01,668
What happened to your nose?

1929
01:47:02,982 --> 01:47:04,925
Well, let's say it's all Marquez.

1930
01:47:06,628 --> 01:47:08,365
- Are you okay?
- I'm not.

1931
01:47:10,422 --> 01:47:11,554
No, it's not.

1932
01:47:12,457 --> 01:47:15,600
But you have to answer:
"I'm fine, thank you. And you?"

1933
01:47:17,108 --> 01:47:18,480
I feel weird.

1934
01:47:19,634 --> 01:47:21,407
I don't know what I want.

1935
01:47:21,490 --> 01:47:22,525
Do you want to...

1936
01:47:23,060 --> 01:47:24,842
who drives a car with a tie on.

1937
01:47:24,925 --> 01:47:26,865
and listening to happy music,

1938
01:47:26,948 --> 01:47:29,577
writes novels with happy endings

1939
01:47:29,660 --> 01:47:31,965
without throwing her hair in the sink.

1940
01:47:33,380 --> 01:47:35,779
Tell me why, if I left you,

1941
01:47:35,862 --> 01:47:37,617
it makes me feel bad for some reason,

1942
01:47:37,700 --> 01:47:39,920
and you're like light and carefree?

1943
01:47:42,068 --> 01:47:44,537
I think it's because I'm desperate, Zoe.

1944
01:47:45,690 --> 01:47:49,554
So much for "joking" as usual.

1945
01:47:52,022 --> 01:47:53,325
Why would you want to see me?

1946
01:47:54,690 --> 01:47:57,622
Because it's not true
that we only had dinner at the restaurant.

1947
01:47:58,914 --> 01:48:00,662
We traveled,

1948
01:48:02,020 --> 01:48:03,771
we laughed a lot, Tom.

1949
01:48:04,457 --> 01:48:06,577
You're the person
who made me laugh the most

1950
01:48:06,660 --> 01:48:08,034
in my life.

1951
01:48:09,714 --> 01:48:12,537
We saved a lot of money
on broken plates.

1952
01:48:15,450 --> 01:48:18,045
And we made love less often than everyone else,

1953
01:48:19,210 --> 01:48:20,662
but a lot better than everyone else.

1954
01:48:21,348 --> 01:48:22,560
And three with two minuses?

1955
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:26,057
Well, it's a weighted average.

1956
01:48:26,140 --> 01:48:28,117
As opposed to the arithmetic mean,

1957
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:30,240
every number counts as more than just a number,

1958
01:48:30,810 --> 01:48:32,627
but it also carries a certain weight,

1959
01:48:32,710 --> 01:48:34,977
its importance, which affects the calculation.

1960
01:48:35,060 --> 01:48:36,080
You got it?

1961
01:48:37,462 --> 01:48:38,582
I realized that...

1962
01:48:39,250 --> 01:48:42,171
you always have
a genius way of looking at things, Zoe.

1963
01:48:43,062 --> 01:48:44,062
You see?

1964
01:48:44,440 --> 01:48:46,125
I've learned when I don't have to anymore.

1965
01:48:48,262 --> 01:48:49,417
Come with me.

1966
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:50,662
We want to...

1967
01:48:51,714 --> 01:48:53,037
too different, Zoya.

1968
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:54,008
Let's give it a try.

1969
01:48:54,091 --> 01:48:55,987
I've tried all these months,

1970
01:48:56,070 --> 01:48:57,451
but it didn't work out.

1971
01:48:58,860 --> 01:49:00,742
And so I'm not me anymore.

1972
01:49:01,771 --> 01:49:04,347
I'm... embarrassed.

1973
01:49:04,430 --> 01:49:07,547
I still don't like to drive,
I like sad music.

1974
01:49:07,630 --> 01:49:08,868
and sad endings.

1975
01:49:11,554 --> 01:49:13,062
And it's nobody's fault.

1976
01:49:15,700 --> 01:49:16,700
It happens.

1977
01:49:18,011 --> 01:49:20,148
If that's the case, why am I not happy?

1978
01:49:21,200 --> 01:49:22,200
Why?

1979
01:49:22,580 --> 01:49:25,371
Because the thought
of leaving without you makes me sad.

1980
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:28,354
Incredibly sad.

1981
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:31,565
I could come with you.

1982
01:49:34,011 --> 01:49:36,034
But what if I asked you to stay?

1983
01:49:50,685 --> 01:49:51,685
All right. Uh-huh.

1984
01:49:52,605 --> 01:49:54,762
Okay, I'll stay with you.

1985
01:49:54,845 --> 01:49:56,388
- Uh-huh?
- Yeah.

1986
01:49:57,110 --> 01:49:58,937
And when are you going to give me a hard time about it?

1987
01:50:00,845 --> 01:50:02,491
How soon we have each other...

1988
01:50:03,222 --> 01:50:04,377
hate?

1989
01:50:06,697 --> 01:50:08,320
And I don't want to hate you, Zoya.

1990
01:50:10,182 --> 01:50:12,662
I realized I wanted to be with you.

1991
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:15,851
You don't want to be with me.

1992
01:50:17,580 --> 01:50:19,645
You're afraid of being without me.

1993
01:50:30,297 --> 01:50:31,428
Will you do me a favor?

1994
01:50:32,830 --> 01:50:35,725
Can you say that corny phrase?

1995
01:50:37,620 --> 01:50:38,891
It's a good place to be right now.

1996
01:50:44,354 --> 01:50:46,354
I'll always be there for you, you know.

1997
01:51:08,697 --> 01:51:14,520
ROMAN BREAKUPS

1998
01:51:39,337 --> 01:51:40,507
Good evening.

1999
01:51:40,590 --> 01:51:41,590
Are you two together?

2000
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:47,880
- Uh, no.
- Uh, no.
