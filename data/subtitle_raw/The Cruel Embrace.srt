1
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,200
I want you to know!
I left!

2
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,840
But... but I'm not dead!

3
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,560
There's a village
called Le Forge

4
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,360
and if you follow the road,
you come to the sea!

5
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,600
In the sea, there is a boat.
I live in it.

6
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,760
You can even stay here
if you come!

7
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,040
It'd be nice if you came!

8
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,360
You can write to me
care of the Café du Forge.

9
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,000
They're friends of mine.

10
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,680
Ludo.

11
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,680
OK, this time you've got pâté,
sardines, bread and milk!

12
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,800
How's that?

13
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,760
And I put in some candles.

14
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,760
- I want a stamp too.
- A stamp?

15
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,480
Nicole!

16
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,440
Got a girlfriend now?

17
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,440
Then I'll buy you a shirt
next time.

18
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,600
All right.

19
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,760
Got a bottle of Monbazillac
and some biscuits?

20
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,440
Don't hide, Ludo.
Don't be a smart aleck.

21
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,720
Say hello to me.

22
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,640
I told you to air out this place!

23
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,680
You're nothing but a pig!

24
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,880
You mustn't save fish heads.
They smell bad.

25
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,600
OK, so you don't want
to talk today either.

26
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,600
I'll read you something.

27
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,160
They put their ears
against the door and listened.

28
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,360
Not a sound.
The wolf had gone away.

29
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,760
The danger was gone.
Nothing to fear.

30
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,080
So they ran to their flutes and
fiddles that they had never left

31
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,000
and began to sing
and dance again.

32
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,160
Who's afraid of the big bad wolf,
the big bad wolf!

33
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,720
Who's afraid of the big bad wolf.
Tra-la-la-la-la!

34
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,080
The wolf,
who was waiting at a distance,

35
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,000
heard their music and singing.

36
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,080
It was all he could do
to keep from laughing.

37
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,360
He had fooled them!

38
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,320
So he got an old sheep skin,

39
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,240
a big basket and a...

40
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,800
What are you doing here?

41
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,720
I've told you over and over,
not to come up here!

42
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,960
I have to teach him something.
You won't let him go to school.

43
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,480
We can't let him rot up here.

44
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,880
You know he's a half-wit!

45
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,880
You're disgusting,
you little idiot!

46
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,680
- Come on!
- I'm sorry!

47
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,720
Hello, Ludo.

48
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,200
Well, say hello.

49
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,920
Hello.

50
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,200
Today you're eating with us
and two guests.

51
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,880
Did you wash this morning?

52
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,920
I've brought you some clothes.

53
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,880
Hurry up and get dressed.

54
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,520
How dumb can you get?
Come here!

55
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,840
It buttons up the front.

56
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,560
Let's drink to it.
Pour us some champagne!

57
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,120
Micho,
do you want to talk now or later?

58
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,520
I'm not very young,
but I'm well off, as they say.

59
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,680
I'm very,

60
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,960
very happy to marry Nicole

61
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,600
and I agree to take Ludovic too.

62
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,520
I'll be sort of his,

63
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,760
his father.

64
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,040
You're not his father.
You're my father!

65
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,840
Be still, Tatav!

66
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,440
My boy.

67
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,680
That's all I have to say.

68
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,560
I was sure my daughter and you
would make a good match!

69
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,680
Don't just stand there.
Go wash it off!

70
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,000
Ludo, eat your food
before it gets cold!

71
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,560
You don't talk much.

72
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,920
You will in time.

73
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,600
Why doesn't he talk more?

74
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,960
He has always been that way.

75
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,080
You'll call me Papa, won't you?

76
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,640
You're not his papa!

77
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,320
Of course I am!

78
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,200
He gets a father,
you get a mother!

79
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,680
You don't lose anything!

80
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,760
Why doesn't he go to school?

81
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,800
He soon will, just wait.

82
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,800
We'll enrol you, won't we son,?

83
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,400
Look... you've even got
a ring for your napkin,

84
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,360
with your name on it, LU DO VIC.

85
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,120
And I'll show you
how to fold it, OK?

86
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,600
You're reading upside-down.

87
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,960
I've got lots of comic books!

88
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,560
My father bought 'em for me.

89
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,320
Who is your father?

90
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,160
Micho.

91
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,360
He is not! Liar!

92
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,760
Mother said it was Micho.

93
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,080
That's a lie, you dumbbell!

94
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,120
Your mother's not your mother.
She's your sister.

95
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,040
And I'm not your brother.

96
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,240
My father is not your father,

97
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,760
Have you ever seen your father?

98
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,840
And you!
- Me?

99
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,680
My father's
the richest man in France!

100
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,520
Why do you groan at night?

101
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,640
I don't groan.

102
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,400
Your mother says you're strange.
I don't like her.

103
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,520
You are strange,
but you're a nice kid.

104
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,240
Here!

105
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,440
Don't grind your teeth tonight.

106
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,280
Come on, hurry up!

107
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,640
But tomorrow, for once,
you'll go to school with Tatav!

108
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,720
And you!

109
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,400
Me? Don't expect me,
to take you to school every day!

110
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,800
Now you behave and be polite.

111
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,240
I don't want to!

112
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,120
Go on in!

113
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,360
This is Ludovic Bossard,
our new pupil.

114
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,800
Go sit in the back, son.

115
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,800
And so,

116
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,800
Julius Caesar exclaimed
to Vercingetorix

117
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,280
I said go sit in the back.

118
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,840
Are you deaf or what?

119
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,280
And you!

120
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,600
And so Julius Caesar
exclaimed to Vercingetorix:

121
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:53,200
"Of all the peoples in Gaul,
the Belgians are the bravest!"

122
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,920
Repeat that, Bossard!

123
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,280
Well, Bossard?

124
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,920
Can't you repeat that?

125
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,840
And you!

126
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,800
Come with me!

127
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,400
Get up there!

128
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,520
On your knees!

129
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,680
Now will you obey?

130
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,920
I'm sorry.

131
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,600
First put my pillow up,

132
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,920
Now go sit on the stool.

133
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,160
How's the weather?

134
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,040
Sunny.

135
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,040
I'm sure it must be windy.

136
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,280
How's school going?

137
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,200
Answer me.

138
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,240
You just won't talk.

139
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,040
Did you put this here?

140
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,960
That's nice of you.

141
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,080
But these aren't flowers.

142
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,360
My favourite flower is the rose.

143
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,720
Have you ever seen roses?

144
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,960
You never want to talk at all?

145
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,280
Why do you groan at night?

146
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,520
I don't groan.

147
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,920
Yes you do. Sounds weird
in the middle of the night.

148
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,560
Mama said you weren't all there.

149
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,960
It's too windy here,
it's exhausting.

150
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,640
That's why I keep catching colds.

151
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,560
Mama used to put cups on me.

152
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,120
Take away this tray,
I'm through.

153
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,880
And go get the glass cups
in the kitchen!

154
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,920
Now do you understand?
You light it.

155
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,680
Then you press hard,
but not too hard.

156
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,160
Try one on yourself first.
I'll feel safer.

157
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,680
Slide your finger under the cups.

158
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,200
That's right.

159
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,600
Turn around and shut your eyes
till I say to open them.

160
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,080
All right.

161
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,160
If you can't do it right,
just quit.

162
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,680
What are you doing?

163
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,720
I'm freezing.
Take them off quick.

164
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,320
How old are you now?

165
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,560
Five.

166
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,560
You're more than five years old,
you idiot.

167
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,840
You're eight years old.

168
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,120
Eight years.

169
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,960
That was eight years ago.

170
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,760
It was so hot that summer.

171
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,680
We took ten dips a day,
but that didn't help.

172
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,440
We kept eating ice cream
at the café on the canal.

173
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,600
Look at me.

174
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,360
Get out of my sight.

175
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,760
Ever been with a girl?

176
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,360
Been where?

177
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,280
You really are a moron.

178
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,440
I've been with one.

179
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,400
We even felt each other's weenie,

180
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,200
or rather I felt hers.
And it cost me.

181
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,520
Weenie!

182
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,920
Cost me five bubble gums
for her weenie! Two for her tits.

183
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,320
Is that the one you want?

184
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,360
It's for your father?

185
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,080
No, it's for Mother's Day.

186
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,560
isn't it too big for your mother?

187
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,720
- And you!
- What did you say?

188
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,800
It's that one she wants,
she told me so.

189
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,120
It costs 4,000 francs.

190
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,680
3,700 francs.

191
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,560
- Is that enough?
- No, not quite enough.

192
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,680
All right, take it.

193
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,240
If your mother
wants to exchange it, she can.

194
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,680
- Have you seen my mother?
- Your mother?

195
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,480
She's a phony. She only
talks to me when Papa's around.

196
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,840
Ludo.

197
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,600
Ludo come here.

198
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,160
Where did you get that?

199
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,760
At the Bazar de Paris.

200
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,200
Why did you give it to me?

201
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,800
You always say
our knives don't cut.

202
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,280
It's not a knife to eat with.

203
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,960
What good is it anyway?

204
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,320
It's a present.

205
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,720
But the money...

206
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,400
Where did you find it?

207
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,040
It's a present.

208
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,320
Must've cost a lot.

209
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,360
At least it'll cut good.

210
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,760
You're capable of
stealing the money.

211
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,160
Who did you steal it from?

212
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,600
From Micho?

213
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,960
Tatav?

214
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,600
Who then?

215
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,040
If you won't answer,
then you are really a thief.

216
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,080
A dirty little thief.

217
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,640
From my purse?
Is that where you got it?

218
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,120
You stole from
your own mother's purse?

219
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,960
A liar and a thief!

220
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:37,600
You'll be punished,
you dirty little thief!

221
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,320
Dirty little thief!

222
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,440
Dirty little thief!

223
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,000
Before going to his study,

224
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,440
Prince Jean enjoys family life
like all other fathers.

225
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,320
The little princes
are delighted to be with him.

226
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,800
Little Princess
Marie-Astrid is proud

227
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,480
to show how she spins her top.

228
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,720
My gold bracelet is gone.

229
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,680
You had it last night.
Where did you put it?

230
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,800
If I knew, I wouldn't ask.
I've looked all over.

231
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,000
It didn't just disappear!

232
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,880
Have you seen it?

233
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,760
Well, can you beat that!

234
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,960
I found it all by myself.

235
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,920
But where?
We looked everywhere.

236
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,200
I'm the one who found it!

237
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,600
But tell me where.

238
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,960
Where we put our shoes.

239
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,520
I found it in a shoe!

240
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,120
Take that dirty thing away!
It is full of germs!

241
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,600
What ever gave you the idea
to look there?

242
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,160
You deserve a reward.

243
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,360
What would you like?

244
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,920
Come and say good night
in my room this evening.

245
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,960
Well, that's easy enough to do!

246
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,520
But you'll be sorry
if your room is a mess!

247
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,480
Now go and play.

248
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,360
I'm not an idiot!
I'm Ludo!

249
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,280
Will you two stop that!
Shut up!

250
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,400
Can't hear yourself think
in this dump!

251
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,920
If you keep that up,
you'll turn him into a priest!

252
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,760
A dirty bigot like you!

253
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,080
And I don't want that!

254
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,960
Why did I marry an old man?

255
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,680
What do you want to be later?

256
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,440
Me?

257
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,560
A plane driver!

258
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,080
You mean a pilot.

259
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,200
You could be a sailor.

260
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,480
Sailors are cute!

261
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,360
They wear bell-bottoms
and blue collars.

262
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,720
They see the world.

263
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,680
Where are they?

264
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,640
In the navy.

265
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,200
You'd wear a nice cap.

266
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,440
But with your silly ears...!

267
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,760
Queen for a day!

268
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:30,000
Queen for a day!

269
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,840
How'd you get here?

270
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,440
We're on vacation.

271
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,240
Tatav'll be home
from school tomorrow.

272
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,040
Why are you so quiet!
when you walk around?

273
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,600
You're becoming a dirty sneak!

274
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,040
Did you take a bath
in my bathroom?

275
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,760
No I didn't.

276
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,960
I could smell your odour.
I had to air it out!

277
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,040
It was my father
who took a bath there.

278
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,440
Micho, you mean.

279
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,600
Who is my father?

280
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,320
Stop talking nonsense!

281
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,680
I'm not! I saw my father!

282
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,320
He came after me in a car.

283
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,280
Don't be a smart aleck!

284
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,600
That's enough, get out.

285
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:58,160
He steals, spies on me,
rummages through my things.

286
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,600
He's a maniac.

287
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,000
I can't stay here alone with him!

288
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,040
He's not like us,
but he doesn't do any harm.

289
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,920
I get nightmares!

290
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,920
His green eyes stare at me,
as big as balloons!

291
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,280
That's not his fault!

292
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,840
- Is it my fault?
- Calm down.

293
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,280
You know,
I can't sleep when I want you.

294
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,040
I won't let you!
Not as long as that idiot's here!

295
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,560
For the baby you want,
forget it!

296
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,600
I won't have a baby
if he stays here!

297
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,880
You promised
to put him in a home!

298
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,600
OK, I'll write to my cousin.

299
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:42,440
You keep saying that,
but you don't write her.

300
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,480
Come and help me, please!

301
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,920
Have a drink!

302
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,120
You don't drink enough
for your age.

303
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,440
Women! Nothing but bitches!

304
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,440
Berthou...

305
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,320
She told me she doesn't sleep
with fat guys.

306
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,040
Than...

307
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:51,000
She said I'm ugly and
have blackheads on my nose.

308
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,840
I'm ugly too.

309
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:57,160
And people say I'm not all there!

310
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,480
And you're a Jew too!

311
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,520
A Jew...

312
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,000
I don't care. Anyway, I'm fat.

313
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,040
Not as fat as you used to be.

314
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,760
Don't waste your breath, pal.

315
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,440
You know...

316
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,800
I don't want you to...

317
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,800
go to the nuthouse.

318
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,120
Your mother's
going to send you there.

319
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,120
That's not even true.

320
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,800
Come on, we're going for a drive.

321
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:03,840
Come on!

322
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,560
That's Cordouan over there

323
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,360
and Saint-André.

324
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,720
When there's no fog,
you can see the lighthouse.

325
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,800
And that over there?

326
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:46,680
What's that?

327
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,720
A military base, obviously.

328
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,800
With a French flag on it!

329
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,760
It was an American base before.

330
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:07,840
I'm cold.

331
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,960
Come on,
let's get something to drink.

332
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,760
Do you know that cafe
on the canal?

333
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,200
A glass of Monbazillac
and a glass of Martini.

334
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,840
My name is Ludo.

335
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,760
I know how to read labels.

336
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,520
I can even write sort of.

337
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,920
I can remember good
with my memory too.

338
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,440
Six sardines in anchovy oil,

339
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:43,800
4 tablespoons every 24 hours
to fortify the body,

340
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,640
- and Jesus is the Son...
- Yes, all right.

341
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,680
Do you like this place?

342
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:57,920
Yes, it's nice.

343
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,520
We drank grenadine
and soda in those days.

344
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,160
My parents knew the woman here.

345
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,000
She hasn't changed.

346
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,560
She liked me.

347
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,080
She called me her "Sunshine".

348
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,440
She didn't recognise me today.

349
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,160
On festival days, my parents
let me come here with Marie-Jo.

350
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,520
Who was Marie-Jo?

351
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,800
A friend of mine.

352
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:48,120
She was jealous of
my nice dresses and my long hair.

353
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,920
So she said I had ugly hands,
but I don't.

354
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:52,520
Jealous!

355
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:57,520
Yes, she imitated me.

356
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,400
If I carried a purse to mass,
she carried one too.

357
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,200
But actually,
we weren't at all alike.

358
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:05,960
We went to the beach together.

359
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,160
We used to meet here.

360
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,040
I met him at that table.

361
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,200
He made us laugh with his accent.

362
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,440
Who?

363
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,520
The American.

364
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,200
- Hello, Will!
- Hello.

365
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,720
Tonight, love-amour,
we're celebrating!

366
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,920
...that I danced in your arms!...

367
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,160
Don't touch me, you bastard!

368
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:50,560
It's from my cousin
at the Saint-Paul Home.

369
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,440
She agrees to take Ludo in.

370
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:18,680
Is it a home for crazies?

371
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,560
No, just feeble-minded people.

372
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,880
My cousin runs the place now.

373
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:26,960
He'll be well treated there.

374
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,080
Health card, birth certificate,
papers, papers!

375
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,320
We'll have to tell her!

376
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:50,920
Your ID card ought to do!

377
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:56,040
I'm not his mother,
it was an accident!

378
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,120
Then who is his mother?
Me? Tatav?

379
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,680
Tell him everything
while you're at it!

380
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:02,600
- All night! All night long!
- Shut up!

381
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:06,040
Tell him what they did to me,
everything I had to do!

382
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,440
Shut up!

383
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,560
When am I leaving?

384
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,400
You scared me!

385
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,600
What are you talking about?

386
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:19,880
In the first place,

387
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,600
how do you know you're leaving?

388
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,080
At night, I hear you talking.

389
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,240
The truth is,

390
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,440
I like you.

391
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,600
I don't want you to go there,
understand?

392
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:44,560
It's your mother.
She says you're not all there!

393
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,520
What's that place I'm going to?

394
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,440
It's...

395
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,760
It's a sort of home!

396
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:05,840
A home for children.

397
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,400
But I'm not a child!

398
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,640
No, you're a grown-up boy now.

399
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,720
- But the others, they're...
- Jealous!

400
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,040
And can I come back?

401
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,520
If you don't, I'll come and get you!

402
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:46,400
I'll come to see you!

403
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:47,640
So will Tatav!

404
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,320
I could've learned
to work with you!

405
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:04,360
If your mother sees you,
she'll get mad, so run along.

406
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,440
Sit in this chair.

407
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:32,040
Tomorrow you're going
to the Saint-Paul Home.

408
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,320
It's a home for children...

409
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,720
who are difficult.

410
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:49,960
You'll be well treated. Micho's
cousin will look after you.

411
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,160
You never spread
enough butter on.

412
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,640
At home, I had fresh croissants
every morning.

413
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:21,040
With Mother's
home-made blackberry jam.

414
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:29,680
Are you listening?

415
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,160
I'm talking to you!
Are you listening?

416
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:35,240
Yes.

417
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,160
Yes, Mama!

418
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:42,040
When you are polite, you say
"Yes, Mama."

419
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:47,320
Say Mama .

420
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,200
Never!

421
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,560
You've never said
"Mama" to your mother!

422
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:04,320
Go on, say it!

423
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:08,240
Go ahead, you idiot!
Say it!

424
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:12,480
Just for once!

425
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:17,920
You don't want to.

426
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,680
You don't want to say "Mama"
to your mother!

427
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:26,520
You're right, you shouldn't,

428
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:30,120
because I'm not your mother,
understand?

429
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,600
It was an accident!

430
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:36,120
Every time I see you,
I see those three guys!

431
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,080
I hear them
under that yellow lamp!

432
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:41,800
Every time I see you,
I see those three bastards!

433
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,320
I'm not your mother, understand?

434
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,760
I'm not your mother!

435
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,600
They're your mother,
all three of them!

436
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,520
It's those bastards!

437
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:53,200
Those three bastards!

438
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,080
Bastards!

439
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:20,080
This is the boys' wing.
The girls have the other wing.

440
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:31,240
This is your room.

441
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:32,320
It overlooks the garden.

442
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:36,960
My name is Ludovic Bossard,
I'm 5 foot 6.

443
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,800
Me, I'm OK.

444
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,440
- It's my ...my mother who...
- Yes, I see.

445
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,680
My name is Mademoiselle Rakoff.

446
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:47,200
Understand?

447
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,800
Yes, Mamzelle Roff.

448
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:53,880
RA KOFF, if you don't mind.

449
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:56,440
- Mademoiselle Rakoff.
- All right.

450
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:57,920
Good!

451
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,720
You make your bed every morning.

452
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:03,960
You can use the grounds, but
you're not allowed to go beyond.

453
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:07,000
You're not allowed to hide,

454
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:11,720
or to go into the girls' wing
or to lie down during the day.

455
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,440
Those are
the only regulations here.

456
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,600
Do you have any questions?

457
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:22,720
Where is the sea?

458
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:26,240
We're not near the sea,
you know that.

459
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,720
The sea is very far.

460
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:31,200
You can see we're
in the middle of a forest.

461
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:34,080
That's not even true.

462
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,000
Don't be impolite!

463
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:38,880
Unpack your suitcase

464
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:41,600
and join us
in the chapel for a concert.

465
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,960
- At what time?
- Time?

466
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,680
Where do you think you are?

467
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:48,960
Time doesn't exist at Saint-Paul.

468
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,960
I blow my whistle
for each activity in the day.

469
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:56,520
Understood?
I'll see you later.

470
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:45,120
Now you all know Ludovic,
our new friend.

471
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:49,680
Will he please come up here now.

472
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:09,600
The sheep stands for your soul.

473
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:14,200
If you are good and pure,
it will be close to the Lord.

474
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:19,120
If not,
it'll be far behind the others,

475
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,360
far away from Jesus.

476
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:37,200
Bless us, oh Lord.

477
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:41,040
Bless this food

478
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:45,280
and this gracious table.

479
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:49,040
Provide bread

480
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:52,920
for those who are hungry.

481
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:57,440
So be it. Amen.

482
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:30,440
I made it.

483
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:39,880
It's for my mother.

484
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:57,640
When I go home,
I'll make one for you.

485
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:02,280
I'll get the shells out
on the breakwater.

486
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:08,440
Come here!

487
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,760
It's a good thing
your parents didn't come today.

488
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,600
It makes you think about it.

489
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:31,640
Maybe they had a flat.

490
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:35,640
My mother once had a flat
and I fixed it.

491
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:38,560
Yes, maybe so.

492
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,720
Come and talk to me
whenever you're unhappy.

493
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,160
And remember,

494
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:48,760
we're your family now.
Your real family.

495
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:50,840
That's not even true!

496
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:09,280
Why didn't you come?

497
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:13,200
I have...

498
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:15,160
a...

499
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:18,920
necklace...

500
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:21,400
with...

501
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:25,640
mussel shells.

502
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:32,280
But...

503
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:36,960
if you don't come,

504
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:44,200
I can't give it to you.

505
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:48,280
And...

506
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:52,400
when can I go back home?

507
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:29,040
Lise!

508
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:50,440
You're not allowed to be late!

509
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:54,040
- Be on time from now on!
- I don't care!

510
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:12,760
That's enough!

511
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,600
Odilon, stop it now.

512
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:23,240
Calm down.

513
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:25,160
That's enough, calm down.

514
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:26,440
Calm down.

515
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:28,880
Ludovic's going to apologise to
you in front of everyone.

516
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:30,280
He stole my picture!

517
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:31,760
Let him go, Doudou!

518
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:33,520
What picture?

519
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:35,640
Of my mother.

520
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:38,000
- She didn't come to see you!
- It's mine.

521
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,160
- Thief!
- That's enough!

522
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:43,120
That'll do now. You'll be
forbidden to talk for six days.

523
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:46,800
Until you agree,
I'll keep this picture.

524
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,240
But it's my mother!

525
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:51,800
My mother!

526
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:54,200
It's my mother!

527
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:59,640
It's my mother!

528
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:24,880
At this rate,
you'll soon cover the ceiling.

529
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:32,320
This home is a family,
Ludo, a family!

530
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:35,880
Yes it is.

531
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:40,680
When I say "Ludo is our child",
this means...

532
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:42,640
you are our little boy.

533
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:44,480
That's a lie!

534
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:46,400
I'm my mother's son
and that's all!

535
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,840
Your mother!
A fine mother indeed!

536
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:51,120
She should've taught you
to be polite!

537
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:55,320
I'm not to blame
if she doesn't come.

538
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:01,800
I hear she's pregnant!

539
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:05,480
Just an act, I bet!

540
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:07,240
So stop bugging us with your mother!

541
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:08,520
Shut up!

542
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:13,120
You!
You're just like me!

543
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:15,760
No-one comes to see you either!

544
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:18,840
You haven't got any
husband or any children!

545
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:20,760
No-one loves you!

546
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:23,240
And your hair is all grey!

547
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,080
You're an old lady!

548
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:57,480
Here's a letter
from your stepfather.

549
01:16:58,920 --> 01:16:59,880
And my picture?

550
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:01,560
What picture?

551
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:04,080
My mother's picture,
the one you took.

552
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:12,040
You don't think
I'm going to give it back.

553
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:15,080
It's not your mother.

554
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:17,360
- She gave it to me.
- Liar.

555
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,160
How old is she?

556
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:23,520
And her hair?

557
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:26,000
She has long red hair.

558
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:30,640
She's not an "old lady",
you mean.

559
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:36,040
I'll give her the picture,
when she comes to see you.

560
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:04,640
Lise!

561
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,680
Lise!

562
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:28,720
Poor little Ludo.

563
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:36,080
He's unhappy
because he hasn't got his mama

564
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,720
to hug him and kiss him.

565
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:45,640
She has not been nice to you.

566
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:48,840
Poor little sweetheart.

567
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:52,160
I feel sorry for you.

568
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:59,440
I'm almost your mother here,

569
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:01,960
aren't I?

570
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:06,600
I can give you
all the love you need.

571
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:11,760
Do you think I was down here

572
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:14,200
by accident?

573
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,840
I know you come here with a girl.

574
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:22,280
Tell me which one!

575
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:24,520
It's not even true.

576
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:29,720
You do dirty things with a girl!

577
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:33,720
With a mother like yours,
I'm not surprised.

578
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:36,720
What kind of a son
can you expect from a slut.

579
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:40,440
Anyway, I'm sending you away.

580
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:43,240
I can go home?

581
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:44,400
Home?

582
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:51,040
You don't have a home, idiot.

583
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:53,400
You're going
to the insane asylum.

584
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:55,400
- Understood?
- I won't go.

585
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:58,600
You won't go?
We'll see about that.

586
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:00,200
I won't go.

587
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:03,680
My mother's coming at Christmas,
for sure.

588
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,280
She's calling for me
at Christmas.

589
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:57,440
I don't want to go
to the madhouse!

590
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:11,120
Little Jesus,

591
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:16,360
when you descend from Heaven...

592
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:55,680
Hasn't your girlfriend
answered yet?

593
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:03,440
By the way,
some cops came by this morning.

594
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:05,600
We don't see cops often here

595
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:07,960
and we don't like 'em.

596
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:09,840
They were looking for a nut

597
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:12,560
who escaped from the crazy house.

598
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,560
No-one like that around here,
we said.

599
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,720
I've been hunting for you
for half an hour.

600
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,120
Hello Ludo.

601
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:26,000
I hurt myself climbing up
and I got my dress dirty.

602
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:33,600
How can anyone live here?

603
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:38,520
You've come to get me?

604
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:41,400
Yes, how did you know?

605
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:57,440
This is your room?

606
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:09,240
Why didn't you come at Christmas?

607
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:10,600
At Christmas?

608
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:12,680
What a silly question.

609
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:14,920
I had other things to do.

610
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:18,680
Well, now here I am.
I've come to talk to you.

611
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:24,320
It's time we made up.

612
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:26,320
That's right.

613
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:31,200
If you want, I can be a sailor
and we can go away.

614
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:32,680
Wait a minute...

615
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:36,600
You've ruined my life.

616
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:39,800
Because of you,
I had to marry an old man,

617
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:44,560
but now we're getting a divorce.

618
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:48,160
Even after you left,
you spoiled my life.

619
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:50,680
I was always scared
you'd do something awful.

620
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:53,400
To think you've
never called me "Mama"

621
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:58,560
and yet you wanted me to come
and see you? No way.

622
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:01,520
But you...
you've never loved me.

623
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:04,320
Don't start
talking nonsense again!

624
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:08,160
I've never been able
to stand the sight of you,

625
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,560
but that has changed too.

626
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:18,640
I'm getting married again.

627
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:26,680
Mademoiselle Rakoff likes you.
She's willing to take you back.

628
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:30,400
You can't keep living here
like a tramp.

629
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:31,640
Why not?

630
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:36,120
Listen to me.

631
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:37,640
Calm down.

632
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:39,760
Calm down.

633
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:43,040
From now on, we'll be friends,

634
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:45,120
alright?

635
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:50,840
Call me "Mama", Ludo.

636
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:54,000
Call me "Mama".
