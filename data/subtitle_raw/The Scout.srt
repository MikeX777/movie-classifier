You're gonna finish
school though, huh?

88
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:58,369
It's not my idea.

89
00:03:58,438 --> 00:03:59,871
I'd kill to play
for the Yankees,

90
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,873
but that's what
my parents want.

91
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:03,875

you wanted to finish.

92
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:05,877
No, but what am I gonna do?

93
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,879
Let me talk toyour parents.

94
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:09,881

95
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,382
Tonight? I wasn't really invited.

I accept.

00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,892
Mmm. These carrots
are so sweet,

99
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,894

for dessert.

Thankyou.

101
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:32,165
You know, the Yankees
are very geared to religion.

102
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:35,432
I couldn't help noticing

103
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,442
that beautiful painting
up there.

104
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,775
That's virtually
the same exact picture

105
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,747
that hangs in the clubhouse.

106
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,451
Terrific likeness, isn't it?

107
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,121
You've heard
of Mickey Mantle?

108
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:52,851
Did you know
his sisterwas a nun?

109
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:54,859
I hadn't heard that.

110
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:56,690
Yes, indeed,
a very famous one.

111
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,355
What was her name?

112
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:01,889
Gee, I believe
it was also Micki,

113
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,401
but with an "I."

114
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,233
Sister Micki
Elizabeth Mantle.

115
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,739
Some nun.

116
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,140
Tommy, you haven't
touched your food.

117
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,643
I'm not hungry.

118
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:15,010
It's no excuse.
Finish your food.

119
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:17,413
He reminds me of me.

120
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:21,419
Couldn't get me to finish my food
ifyou paid me.

121
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,421
Now try to keep me away.

122
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,751
May I say something?

123
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:25,984
Yeah.

124
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,993
I believe education
is most important

125
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:29,995
and that people
should finish school.

126
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,655
I know Tommy does, too.

127
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:33,665
But Tommy has a dilemma,

128
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:36,497
and that is that...
he's gifted.

129
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:39,504
And he's really concerned.

130
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:42,006
What does he do
with that gift?

131
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:46,011
Does he sign on the dotted line
right now, make $500,000,

132
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,014
go to the biggest city
in the world,

133
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:53,109
and become a member ofthe most
prestigious baseball team that everwas,

134
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,120
or does he continue
his schooling,

135
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,248
possibly trip over a book
on the way to math class

136
00:05:58,324 --> 00:05:59,723
and be worth nothing?

137
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:04,388
But he knows that with the kind of money
you make in baseball,

138
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,398
even ifyou didn't
finish school,

139
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,525
your education
doesn't have to stop.

140
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:12,401
Tommy knows that many
ofthe ballplayers hire tutors.

141
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,406
Did you know that?

142
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,908
Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb,
Lou Gehrig...

143
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:20,537
they all had tutors
with them in the dugout.

144
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:21,545
Lou Gehrig...

145
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:22,979
had a tutor?

146
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,482
Oh, yes, ma'am. Yeah.

147
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,814
Didn't he also have
a terrible disease?

148
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:30,287
He did, but he didn't
get it from the tutor.

149
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:33,553
I think he got that
in college.

150
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:35,719
Soyou can see
Tommy's dilemma.

151
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,786
Do I take God's gift

152
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:42,062
and go play for the greatest
baseball team that ever lived,

153
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:46,572
or do I stay in a small school
and hope I don't trip?

154
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,472
Is this what
you were thinking, Tommy?

155
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:52,204
That's exactly...right.

156
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:55,441
I can have a tutor, Mom,
right in the dugout.

157
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,380
Please, Mom, let me play.

158
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,382
Please?

00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:00,119

I sure have,
a year ago,

167

We gave up Reynolds
for Lacy?

168
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:20,071
Sure hope it's
the right thing to do.

169
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,073
Wait till you
see him pitch.

170
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:24,575
You'd give up two Reynolds
to get him.

171
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:29,414
By the way, how come he's not
with the team?

172
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,109
I wouldn't worry
about it.

180

Tell them I can't.

729
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:22,899
Take the bedroom.
I'll sleep out here.

730
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,400
I'm all right here.

731
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:26,903
I don't wantyou
screwing upyour back.

732
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:28,404
Take the bedroom.

733
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:29,405
O.K.

734
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:35,468
Look at the size
ofthis bed!

735
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:36,979
Don't jump on that!

736
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:38,982
That's not gonna hold!

737
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,415
I'm sorry.

738
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:44,147
Where's that box
of phone numbers

739
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:45,689
I had
on the airplane?

740
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:48,925
I can't believe
that people

741
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:51,928
are gonna be getting laid
in this apartment,

742
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:53,930
and I'm not one ofthem.

743
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,525
[Snoring]

744
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:03,599
Go away.

745
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:05,539
[Mumbling]

746
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:07,908
Put it down.

747
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:10,880
I hateyou!

748
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:13,883
I can't stop!

749
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:20,490
Aah!

750
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:28,432
Good morning.

751
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:31,400
I want to thankyou all
for coming here

752
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:33,027
on such short notice.

753
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:36,039
But, boy, have we got
a beautiful day for this.

754
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:38,632
Jesus Christ,
he's going to make speeches now.

755
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:40,643
Now in my opinion,

756
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:43,145
you're about to see
the best ballplayer

757
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:44,647
I've ever seen,

758
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:46,148
butyou be the judge.

759
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:47,650
No more talk.

760
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:49,151
Time to see him.

761
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,915
Ladies and gentlemen...

762
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:53,081
Steve Nebraska,

763
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:54,920
right here.

764
00:34:57,628 --> 00:34:59,357
Come out now!

765
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,058
Where is he?

766
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:06,363
Where is he, Al?

767
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,871
There we go,
Steve Nebraska!

768
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,874
Come on out.

769
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,705
Check the turnpike, Al.

770
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,371
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

771
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,746
I'm sure.

772
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:21,375
Where is he? Steve!

773
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:24,250
There he is.
Just getting his shoes on.

774
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:25,880
Steve Nebraska!

775
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,585
Take a few warmups,

776
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:31,059
and let me know
when you're ready.

777
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,562
I don't need
to warm up.

778
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,063
Areyou sure?

779
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,895
He's all warmed up.

780
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,401
I guess that's what
he was doing.

781
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,027
O.K., now,

782
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:41,901
a pitcher
ofSteve's quality

783
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,703
has got to have somebody
to pitch to.

784
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:48,734
Can you believe who's
going to help us out here?

785
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,246
One ofthe greats--

786
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:52,145
Keith Hernandez!

787
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,416
Keith!

788
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:57,010
Thanks a lot
for coming.

789
00:35:57,088 --> 00:35:58,851
Right up there.

790
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:00,356
O.K., here we go!

791
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:03,059
Where's my money?

792
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:04,526
I don't
have it on me.

793
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:06,028
I don't do this

794
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:08,031
unless I'm paid
up-front.

795
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:10,863
I'll giveyou
the money, O.K.?

796
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:13,631
O.K.

797
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:15,365
Steve, fire when ready.

798
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:35,281
Excuse me...

799
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,294
I, um, I don't know
what those signals mean.

800
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,887
Then why areyou shaking
your head no?

801
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:42,398
Uh, I don't know.

802
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:44,627
You're supposed
to shake no, right?

803
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,398
Hey,just throw
whatyou want to throw.

804
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:50,031
O.K., all right.

805
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:06,183
Ooh!

806
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:07,690
Holy mackerel!

807
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:13,459
I've never seen
anything like this.

808
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:16,466
How much doyou
want to go on this kid?

809
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:17,967
Whatever it takes.

810
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:19,525
You got it.

811
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:27,872
Man, did you see that?

812
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,881
Strike 3. He's out.

813
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:37,785
Keith, step out a minute,
will you, please?

814
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:39,379
Larry, did you clock him?

815
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:40,890
It's broken.

816
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:43,893
It says 6 then 7
then 9.

817
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:46,395
It had to be
faster than that.

818
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:47,522
That's 1 09.

819
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,395
Oh, no, it can't be.

820
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:51,401
This thing doesn't
go over 1 00.

821
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:52,902
See the asterisk?

822
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,403
That means
you've reached 1 00,

823
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:56,838
then you've got
your number--1 09.

824
00:37:58,409 --> 00:37:59,842
God damn.

825
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,003
Ifall Steve did
was pitch,

826
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,512
that would be
pretty good,

827
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:05,572
but he likes
to hit, too.

828
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,050
I wanted to give him
the best competition,

829
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,417
so to help us out...

830
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:12,422
Bret Saberhagen.

831
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:16,359
Bret, thanks a lot.
I appreciate it.

832
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:17,860
I haven't been
paid yet.

833
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:19,862
What is it
with you guys?

834
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,363
It's in the mail.

835
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:23,866
Keith said I'm supposed
to get paid first.

836
00:38:23,934 --> 00:38:25,868
He's just
a mistrustful fellow.

837
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:27,369
That was the agreement.

838
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:30,373
$9 million,
he needs my money.

839
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,615
Whoa!

840
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:51,254
O.K. Ifl switch?

841
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,796
Do whatever
you want.

842
00:38:57,435 --> 00:39:00,004
Well, thereyou have it.

843
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:02,071
Where'd this guy
come from?

844
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:05,370
The bidding's going to go
differently than you're used to.

845
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:09,106
All sealed bids will be
delivered to me

846
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,875
within one hour.

847
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:13,178
How comeyou're
accepting the bids?

848
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,877
Who authorized you?

849
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:16,214
Steve did.

850
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:18,278
Rememberwhen
you let me go?

851
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,881
He hired me.

852
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:32,129
Yeah, that's fair.

853
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,104
Yankee letterhead.

854
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:38,164
Look at
Steinbrenner.

855
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:39,174
Pokerfaced.

856
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:43,879
Ladies and gentlemen...

857
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:46,382
thankyou forwaiting.

858
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:49,248
We're ready to announce
now the winning bid.

859
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,754
We want to thank
you all very much.

860
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:52,789
Uh...

861
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:54,882
I've never done
this before.

862
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:58,019
I'm a scout,
not a speaker.

863
00:39:58,095 --> 00:40:00,825
I'm a little nervous
at this.

864
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,389
I want to thank
all ofthe clubs.

865
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:06,527
All ofthe bids were
very, very respectable,

866
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:08,037
but like a baseball game,

867
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:10,096
somebody has to win,
and somebody did.

868
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:14,804
With a bid
of $55 million

869
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:17,814
overthe next
fouryears,

870
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:20,282
Steve Nebraska
is very proud to be

871
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:22,148
a New YorkYankee!

872
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:25,313
Thankyou for coming, and
we'll seeyou on the field.

873
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:27,482
$55 million
after one tryout?

874
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:29,458
How can you
justify that?

875
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:31,927
I have to go
with my gut instinct.

876
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:33,429
Afterwhat I saw today,

877
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:35,556
he's worth every
penny ofit.

878
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:37,157
So he's pitching
right away?

879
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:40,431
He's pitching as soon as
we get him in uniform.

880
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:43,302
That's not the way
the deal was structured.

881
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:45,137
It isn't?

882
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:47,803
Uh, Mr. Wilson may
not be informed,

883
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:51,473
but the teams were in agreement
that no matterwho got Steve,

884
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:53,813
because we're far
into this season,

885
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:57,547
Steve doesn't want to take
any blame or credit,

886
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:01,079
so he would get a fresh start
next year as a Yankee.

887
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:03,388
Well, just a minute.
What areyou saying?

888
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,986
We can't play him
this year?

889
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:07,496
Stop taking my picture.

890
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:09,260
You got 32 already.

891
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:12,894
Mr. Wilson is asking
what would happen

892
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,403
ifthe NewYorkYankees

893
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,565
would get into
theWorld Series?

894
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,904
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

895
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,207
Why are they
laughing, Al?

896
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:24,747
I'm going to make
a deal right now.

897
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:27,249
IftheYankees get
in theWorld Series,

898
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,912
Steve Nebraska
pitches the first game.

899
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,249
All right?

900
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,916
Does that mean I pitch
the first game?

901
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:36,425
It can never happen.
Don't worry.

902
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:40,960
How manyyears
did you play in Mexico?

903
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:42,965
Steve, where
doyou live?

904
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:44,625
Um, I don't know.

905
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:46,693
Al, Al, Al, Al!

906
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:48,738
Al, Al, Al, Al!

907
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:50,706
All right, all right.

908
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:53,174
Folks, it's been
a very long morning.

909
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:55,940
He's tired.
Just give him a break.

910
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,537
No more pictures.

911
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:07,389
Put him down!
Put him down!

912
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:09,948
Now, gentlemen--

913
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:12,793
All right.

914
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:17,560
I just want to reiterate

915
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:19,899
on behalf
ofGeorge Steinbrenner...

916
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,402
O.K., it's official.

917
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:22,734
[Applause]

918
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:24,706
Congratulations,
Steve.

919
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:29,108
Al, I want to talk
toyou for a minute.

920
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:30,908
Be right back, kiddo.

921
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:35,418
Al, we're going to need
a little something from you.

922
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:37,954
Your lawyer didn't tell you
about the letter?

923
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:41,321
What areyou talking about?
What letter?

924
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,825
Before we pay him,

925
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:45,418
we'll need a letter
from a psychiatrist

926
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:46,929
saying that
he's all right.

927
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:48,931
You already
paid him the money.

928
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:50,398
He just signed
the contract.

929
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:53,436
That was ceremonial.
Your lawyer knows this.

930
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:56,098
This is the most
amount of money

931
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:57,868
anybody has every been paid.

932
00:42:57,942 --> 00:42:59,375
Mr. Steinbrenner
wants assurances

933
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:02,276
that Steve won't flake out
likeyour other picks.

934
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:04,644
I find this insulting.
This is ridiculous.

935
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:07,115
Did you see him pick up
that photographer?

936
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:08,378
So what?

937
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:10,044
I told him to.

938
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:13,055
Then I told him to put him down,
which he did.

939
00:43:13,123 --> 00:43:15,785
I find this
very insulting.

940
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:18,123
I'll have the letter
tomorrow.

941
00:43:18,195 --> 00:43:21,653
We can setyou up
with a doctor ifyou like.

942
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:23,962
My sisterwas
in the field.

943
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:25,524
As long as
they're qualified.

944
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,537
Well, of course
they'll be qualified.

945
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,470
I'm not an idiot.

946
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,599
" Physicians...

947
00:43:31,675 --> 00:43:33,233
physicians...

948
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:35,244
plastic surgery...

949

Dr. H. Aaron!"

954
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:43,917
Oh, boy!

955
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:46,923
Hammering Hank,
yes, indeed.

956
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:51,654
Hey, Steve.

957
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:54,459
Save a little
ofthat appetite for lunch.

958
00:43:57,434 --> 00:43:58,366
Hello?

959
00:43:58,435 --> 00:44:00,027
Dr. H. Aaron, please.

960
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:01,594
This is she.

961
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:02,866
You're kidding.

962
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:06,375
I'd like to come
seeyou right now.

963
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:07,876
Is that a possibility?

964
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:09,378
Who am I speaking to?

965
00:44:09,446 --> 00:44:12,677
I'm Al Percolo, and I'm with
the NewYorkYankees.

966
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,684
Would you like
an appointment?

967
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:16,185
I'd like one now.

968
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:19,188
Ifyou're still at that address
in theYellow Pages,

969
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:20,883
I could scoot over now.

970
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:22,892
Is this an emergency?

971
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,621
Well...

972
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:27,788
yes, yes.

973
00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:29,298
Yes, it is.

974
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:31,391
I'll seeyou
in 45 minutes.

975
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:32,901
O.K., we'll waste
a little...

976
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:36,462
Well, we'll see you
in 45 minutes.

977
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:39,406
Fantastic.

978
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:40,909
I did it.

979
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:42,411
1 0 minutes
with this broad,

980
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:44,310
we got the letter.

981
00:44:46,483 --> 00:44:47,415
You know, last night

982
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:48,917
you were really having

983
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:50,920
quite a little nightmare.

984
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:52,421
No, I wasn't.

985
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:53,421
You weren't?

986
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:55,424
Maybe it was me.

987
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:57,357
Yep.

988
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:59,362
Cranham Center.
This is it.

989
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:16,879
What's she going
to do, Al?

990
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:18,380
It's like a physical,

991
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:19,882
only mental.

992
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:30,393
[Sniffling]

993
00:45:37,835 --> 00:45:39,268
Was that the doctor?

994
00:45:39,336 --> 00:45:40,769
Gee, I hope not.

995
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:44,566
Good morning.
I'm Dr. Aaron.

996
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:45,835
Mr. Percolo?

997
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:47,399
I'm Mr. Percolo.

998
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:50,447
Uh, could I talk toyou
for a minute?

999
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:51,446
Of course.

1000
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:52,948
I'll be right back.

1001
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,578
[Sniffs]

1002
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:04,186
I appreciateyou seeing us
on such short notice.

1003
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:07,196
Before we start,
may I askyou a question?

1004
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,196
Sure.

1005
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:09,698
You licensed?

1006
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,200
Am I licensed?

1007
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:13,566
Yes, I am licensed.

1008
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:15,571
Would it be rude to...

1009
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:17,072
to see a diploma?

1010
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:19,302
Anything you can show me?

1011
00:46:19,376 --> 00:46:21,867
No one's asked
to see my diploma

1012
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:24,311
since I began
the practice.

1013
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:25,746
No.

1014
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:27,306
Yes.

1015
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:28,783
It's on the wall.

1016
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:29,784
Those?

1017
00:46:29,853 --> 00:46:30,785
Mm-hmm.

1018
00:46:30,854 --> 00:46:32,788
I'll take
a quick look.

1019
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:39,394
Harvard?

1020
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:40,896
Whoa, whoa!

1021
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:41,896
Great.

1022
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,398
That's the real one?

1023
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,401
Yes, that's
the real one.

1024
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,904
Well, this is
very impressive.

1025
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,906
Anything with
a picture on it?

1026
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,407
Is this a joke?

1027
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:53,909
Is this a joke?

1028
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,411
I just want
to make sure it's you.

1029
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,209
It's got to beyou.

1030
00:46:58,282 --> 00:46:59,840
You can't put up a diploma
ifit's notyours.

1031
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:01,544
That's a felony,
isn't it?

1032
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:04,348
Why don'tyou tell me
what's going on?

1033
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:07,356
The kid sitting out there,
Steve Nebraska,

1034
00:47:07,424 --> 00:47:08,857
is probably the best
baseball player

1035
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:10,450
that ever lived.

1036
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:13,462
He has just signed a deal
with the New YorkYankees

1037
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:16,522
that's gonna make him
almost $60 million.

1038
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,034
When you pay
that kind of money,

1039
00:47:19,102 --> 00:47:22,037
you want to be assured
that everything's gonna be O.K.

1040
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:25,040
Theyjust need a couple ofsentences
on a letterhead

1041
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:26,541
that they believe
that says

1042
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,544
he's not gonna
shoot anybody

1043
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:32,048
or run away
or throw up on the mound.

1044
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:34,777
Tell me again what this letter
should say?

1045
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,376
Address it
to George Steinbrenner.

1046
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:37,886
You just want to say...

1047
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:40,389
whoyou are
in a sentence or two.

1048
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:42,391
Say thatyou went
to Harvard...

1049
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:44,484
is the right thing
to say.

1050
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:46,654
And then say
Steve's not nuts,

1051
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:48,129
not gonna run away.

1052
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:49,893
Good deal there.
Congratulations.

1053
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:51,400
Then you'll sign
your name.

1054
00:47:51,468 --> 00:47:54,403
Ifyou want to include
a xerox ofthe diploma,

1055
00:47:54,471 --> 00:47:55,904
that would be helpful.

1056
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:59,272
And you could put, " P.S.
Sorry about Billy Martin."

1057
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:00,640
Billy Martin?

1058
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,838
Just a guy he kept firing

1059
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:04,346
till he finally died.

1060
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:07,516
Why don't I talk
to Steve,

1061
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:10,144
and then we can
talk after that?

1062
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,654
You don't want to do
the letter first?

1063
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,953
I don't think so.

1064
00:48:18,795 --> 00:48:20,820
These smell so good.

1065
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:23,093
Yes, it's nice.

1066
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:30,702
What areyou doing?

1067
00:48:30,774 --> 00:48:32,207
What areyou doing?

1068
00:48:32,276 --> 00:48:33,709
It's a physical.

1069
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:34,709
What physical?

1070
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:36,211
Al said that--

1071
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,374
I told him
itwas like a physical.

1072
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:42,612
Putyour pants on.

1073
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:43,675
We're done.

1074
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:46,086
Maybe itwould be better,
Mr. Percolo,

1075
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:48,886
ifl spoke
to Steve alone.

1076
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:50,392
All right.

1077
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:51,392
Um...

1078
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:52,894
I'll be right out here.

1079
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:56,831
I would prefer
ifAl stayed here

1080
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,061
in the room with me.

1081
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:02,970
Well, I'd really rather
talk toyou alone.

1082
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,974
I know,
but I would feel

1083
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:06,475
much more
comfortable.

1084
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:07,976
It's his first time,

1085
00:49:08,045 --> 00:49:10,377
and he's just
a little nervous,

1086
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:11,880
so I'll sit here.

1087
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:14,884
You won't even know
I'm in the room.

1088
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,317
I'll disappear.

1089
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:18,183
All right.

1090
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:19,347
All right.

1091
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:22,858
Please sit down,
Steve.

1092
00:49:22,926 --> 00:49:24,359
Ahem.

1093
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:26,362
So, Steve,
where areyou from?

1094
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:27,863
I found him in Mexico.

1095
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:29,364
I was asking Steve.

1096
00:49:29,433 --> 00:49:30,365
I answered?

1097
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:31,366
Yeah.

1098
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:33,369
Soyou're
from Mexico?

1099
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:35,371
Uh, no,
I'm not from Mexico.

1100
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:38,374
I was just down there
for a couple ofyears.

1101
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:39,932
And why Mexico?

1102
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:42,877
Because it's, um...

1103
00:49:42,946 --> 00:49:44,743
where I went.

1104
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:45,941
Mm-hmm.

1105
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:48,541
You don't rememberwhat
broughtyou down there?

1106
00:49:48,618 --> 00:49:49,550
Uh-uh.

1107
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:50,881
Well...

1108
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:53,889
uh, not, not...

1109
00:49:53,957 --> 00:49:57,393
Baseball broughtyou
down there, didn't it?

1110
00:49:57,461 --> 00:49:59,725
Baseball brought me
down there.

1111
00:49:59,796 --> 00:50:02,924
You really like
baseball, hmm?

1112
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,058
Yes, ma'am,

1113
00:50:04,134 --> 00:50:06,568
it's myfavorite thing
in thewholeworld.

1114
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:08,900
When did you
start playing?

1115
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:12,632
Steve, is there
something wrong?

1116
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:16,903
I just, uh...

1117
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:19,073
I don't like
all these questions.

1118
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:21,583
Doyou sometimes feel
that there are things

1119
00:50:21,651 --> 00:50:24,586
thatyou try to remember
and can't?

1120
00:50:24,654 --> 00:50:26,417
Yeah. No.

1121
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:28,390
I guess so.
I don't know.

1122
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:30,926
You know what
I'd like to try?

1123
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:33,428
I'd like to showyou
some pictures.

1124
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:36,432
I wantyou to give me
your immediate response.

1125
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,933
Just look
at the picture,

1126
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:39,434
and without
even thinking,

1127
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:42,404
just tell me
what it means toyou.

1128
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:46,442
It's kind oflike
a word-association game.

1129
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:47,943
Just look
at the picture

1130
00:50:48,011 --> 00:50:50,445
and tell mewhatever
comes toyour mind.

1131
00:50:52,516 --> 00:50:53,448
O.K.

1132
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:54,449
Who's that?

1133
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:56,247
These aren't actual people.

1134
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:59,311
Now what does this
look like toyou?

1135
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:00,822
That guy's faking it.

1136
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:04,088
You can tell 'cause the doctors
don't look concerned at all.

1137
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:07,392
He's just pretending
to be in a coma.

1138
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:09,193
He knows ifhe
opens his eyes,

1139
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:12,531
he's going to see his bill.

1140
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:14,035
He stays in a coma

1141
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:16,868
so he doesn't have
to pay his bill.

1142
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,373
What a great idea.

1143
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:20,410
Mr. Percolo, ifyou
keep speaking,

1144
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:23,640
I'm going to have to askyou
to step outside.

1145
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:24,907
Sorry.

1146
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:27,814
You know, the medical costs
being what they are--

1147
00:51:27,884 --> 00:51:30,114
The next picture, Steve.

1148
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:34,357
These guys are in trouble.

1149
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:37,120
They look like
they're in trouble?

1150
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:39,719
Not yet, but when
that driver gets angry,

1151
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:41,229
and he's going to,

1152
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:43,926
they're all going to start
screaming and crying.

1153
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,194
It's just--

1154
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:48,760
It's going to be a mess.

1155
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:55,937
This one?

1156
00:51:57,747 --> 00:51:58,975
She sneezed.

1157
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:05,486
Anything else?

1158
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:07,386
Um...

1159
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,391
she sneezed by the door.

1160
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:11,051
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1161
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:17,258
That's Batman.

1162
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:18,767
Batman?

1163
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:21,269
Batman. Sometimes
he goes without his cape.

1164
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,242
O.K.

1165
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:30,245
And this is
the last one.

1166
00:52:37,954 --> 00:52:40,149
[Coughs]
Fishing.

1167
00:52:40,223 --> 00:52:42,418
Fishing--
two guys fishing.

1168
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:44,619
Very good.
Anything else?

1169
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:48,697
[Sighs]

1170
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:50,460
O.K., let's see.

1171
00:52:51,701 --> 00:52:54,135
They're...two guys
fishing for trout.

1172
00:52:54,204 --> 00:52:55,569
Very good.

1173
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:57,163
Yeah? Yeah?

1174
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,299
Very good.
You did verywell.

1175
00:52:59,376 --> 00:53:00,308
I did?

1176
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:01,309
Yes, absolutely.

1177
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:04,006
Hey. Ha ha ha.

1178
00:53:05,215 --> 00:53:07,274
Ifyou
could step outside

1179
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:10,251
while I talk to Mr. Percolo,
then we'll be through.

1180
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,721
O.K. All right,
I'll...

1181
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:16,588
[Door Opens And Closes]

1182
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:18,924
He's got some imagination,
doesn't he?

1183
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:20,428
Boy, that coma story.

1184
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:23,489
I neverwould have thought
that was Batman. He's something.

1185
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:26,502
I'm not going to talk
in complicated medical terms

1186
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:28,765
because it wouldn't
do much good anyway.

1187
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:29,930
Appreciate that.

1188
00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:31,940
He's disconnected
in some way.

1189
00:53:32,008 --> 00:53:33,600
It's very interesting,

1190
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:36,111
but his response
to this picture,

1191
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:38,044
the father and the son,

1192
00:53:38,114 --> 00:53:41,049
he didn't recognize
as father and son.

1193
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:43,551
Almost 98% ofthe people
shown that picture

1194
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,554
immediately make
that association.

1195
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:50,150
Hmm. Let me see it
for a second, may I?

1196
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:53,321
I don't think that's
father and son necessarily.

1197
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:56,365
Doesn't that guy look like
a fishing teacher toyou?

1198
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:58,264
Whatever.

1199
00:53:58,335 --> 00:53:59,768
Um, in any case,

1200
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:02,361
his responses to
the other pictures,

1201
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:06,034
theywere pretty much
showing confused emotions.

1202
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:09,545
It's obvious Steve's not in touch
with a part ofhimself.

1203
00:54:09,613 --> 00:54:12,548
That's one reason why he's
such a good ballplayer.

1204
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:15,050
He's thinking of nothing
but hitting the ball.

1205
00:54:15,118 --> 00:54:16,551
And pitching the ball.

1206
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:20,056
You should see.
Strike after strike, like a machine.

1207
00:54:20,123 --> 00:54:21,556
It's just--
It's great.

1208
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:23,559
Well, O.K.,
interesting stuff.

1209
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:26,061
Now, do I wait
for the letter

1210
00:54:26,129 --> 00:54:29,064
or doyou want
to fax this over?

1211
00:54:29,132 --> 00:54:32,568
Well, Mr. Percolo,
I feel I can't give him a letter

1212
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:35,696
that says he should play,
because I don't think he should.

1213
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:38,138
You got to give him
the letter.

1214
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:40,335
We--We need the letter.

1215
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:43,345
Let me try and explain
something toyou.

1216
00:54:43,413 --> 00:54:46,849
Um, ahem, let's just suppose
that Steve has blocked something,

1217
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:49,851
and then let's imagine he
suddenly remembers it.

1218
00:54:49,919 --> 00:54:52,854
Ifhe should do that,
he could becomeveryviolent,

1219
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:55,356
to himself
and to other people.

1220
00:54:55,425 --> 00:54:57,359
He should be in therapy.

1221
00:54:57,427 --> 00:54:59,054
He shouldn't be
playing athletics.

1222
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,562
He's not
playing athletics.

1223
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,064
In grammar school,
you play athletics.

1224
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,566
He's playing
professional baseball.

1225
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:06,568
Besides, violence
is a plus.

1226
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:09,070
You ever see those fellas?
They're huge.

1227
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,573
The best ballplayers
never had any memory.

1228
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,575
RememberWhitey Ford,
great pitcher?

1229
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:15,577
Know why they
called him Whitey?

1230
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:18,580
He couldn't remember
his real name. No memory.

1231
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:20,047
I could go on--

1232
00:55:20,116 --> 00:55:22,550
I really can't do it.
I'm sorry.

1233
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:26,077
Ma'am, listen, I'm not
saying you're wrong, O.K.?

1234
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,589
Maybe he's
got some problems.

1235
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:29,591
But what areyou doing?

1236
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:32,594
He's one ofthe greatest
ballplayers I've ever seen,

1237
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:34,254
and I've seen them all.

1238
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:35,764
I'll workwith you.

1239
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:38,198
I'll bring him
seven days a week.

1240
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:41,203
I'll bring him twice
a day ifyou need it.

1241
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:43,705
But don't deny him
something that he loves.

1242
00:55:43,773 --> 00:55:47,265
Without baseball,
then--then he's got nothing.

1243
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:48,777
And then he'll be,

1244
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:51,780
well, he'll be the guy
you say he is.

1245
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:53,577
He'll just
be poor, too.

1246
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:55,584
You would bring him
every day?

1247
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:57,085
Every single day.

1248
00:55:57,153 --> 00:55:59,587
That'll be an important
part ofhis life,

1249
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:01,089
his working with you.

1250
00:56:01,157 --> 00:56:02,590
The letter's
just insurance.

1251
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:04,889
I don't think he'll
play this year anyway.

1252
00:56:04,961 --> 00:56:06,895
Theywon't
get in the series.

1253
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:08,897
Really, he's yours
till April.

1254
00:56:08,965 --> 00:56:11,490
He'll have lots oftherapy
before getting on a field.

1255
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:14,002
We just want him
on the roster.

1256
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:16,334
That's whywe
need the letter.

1257
00:56:16,406 --> 00:56:18,397
You got to do it.
Please.

1258
00:56:18,475 --> 00:56:20,909
Ifyou promiseyou'll
bring him every day,

1259
00:56:20,977 --> 00:56:23,241
I'll write a letter
saying he can play.

1260
00:56:23,313 --> 00:56:26,749
You give me a letter,
I'll give one back.

1261
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:29,751
You say he can play,
I'll say he'll be here.

1262
00:56:29,819 --> 00:56:31,184
I don't need a letter.

1263
00:56:31,254 --> 00:56:32,687
This worked out great.

1264
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:35,691
When I sawyour name
in the Yellow Pages,

1265
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:37,954
I said,
"This woman's special."

1266
00:56:38,027 --> 00:56:40,962
I'll call in the morning,
we'll set up the schedule.

1267
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:43,464
I'll come by early
forthe letter.

1268
00:56:43,533 --> 00:56:45,967
That's fantastic.

1269
00:56:46,035 --> 00:56:48,503
Oh, wait a second.
Wait a second.

1270
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:50,300
I think
you should know

1271
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:53,706
it's likely Steve will look
toyou as a father figure.

1272
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:56,712
You know what?
It's already started to happen.

1273
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,544
I'm trying to fill those shoes.
I'll do my best.

1274
00:56:59,616 --> 00:57:01,550
I understand,
but this a father

1275
00:57:01,618 --> 00:57:04,519
Steve might want to
put a bullet through.

1276
00:57:06,656 --> 00:57:08,590
How's he feel
about his uncles?

1277
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:11,491
- You know that by looking
at those pictures?
- No.

1278
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:14,496
All right,
thanks for the warning.

1279
00:57:14,564 --> 00:57:17,897
Uncle Al's got
good news foryou. Ha.

1280
00:57:17,967 --> 00:57:19,400
You did great.

1281
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:20,902
You think so?

1282
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:23,905
She loves you, wants
to seeyou every day.

1283
00:57:23,973 --> 00:57:27,409
I don't know ifl want
to see her every day.

1284
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:30,412
It's a good place to
let outyour problems.

1285
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,913
I don't know her.

1286
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:35,348
She's a doctor.
Once you pay her, you know her.

1287
00:57:35,418 --> 00:57:37,045
~You gotta have ~

1288
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,554
~ Heart ~

1289
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:43,388
~ All you really
need is heart ~

1290
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,052
~ Ifyou don't
have heart ~

1291
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:47,062
~Then you
don't get dinner ~

1292
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,064
~You gotta have heart ~

1293
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,565
~ Ba da da dee ~~

1294
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:53,568
That's a great movie.
It's about baseball.

1295
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:54,568
Damn Yankees,

1296
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:56,070
Damn Yankees,

1297
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:58,073
Al!
Talk to us!

1298
00:57:58,141 --> 00:57:59,574
Stop ducking us!

1299
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:01,974
Hey, would you
go away, please?

1300
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:03,910
We're trying
to eat dinner.

1301
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,242
Where's Steve?

1302
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:07,442
He's with me.
Now, good night.

1303
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:09,451
People want
to know things.

1304
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:11,453
How about
a press conference?

1305
00:58:11,521 --> 00:58:14,752
We're not doing a press conference
like Romeo andJuliet,

1306
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:16,985
We'll do it
at another time.

1307
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:17,992
What are you doing?

1308
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:19,255
Throwing plates.

1309
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,990
You can't do that.

1310
00:58:21,064 --> 00:58:23,123
M-M-M-Move!

1311
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:24,257
Aah!

1312
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:25,733
M-M-M-Move!

1313
00:58:25,802 --> 00:58:27,599
No! No! No! No!

1314
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,661
You can't do that!

1315
00:58:29,739 --> 00:58:30,706
Are you nuts?

1316
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:33,970
I didn't mean that.
Don't throw plates.

1317
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:35,408
Please!

1318
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:37,343
No!

1319
00:58:37,413 --> 00:58:39,347
No! No! No! No!

1320
00:58:41,751 --> 00:58:43,685
I've got
a crazy landlady.

1321
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:46,085
She's here
throwing things.

1322
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:47,588
She'll kill ya!

1323
00:58:47,657 --> 00:58:48,749
More plates!

1324
00:58:48,825 --> 00:58:51,055
Oh, no, we're
going to get sued.

1325
00:58:51,127 --> 00:58:52,253
They're gone.

1326
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:56,599
You got a knife
anywhere?

1327
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:57,598
A what?

1328
00:58:57,667 --> 00:58:59,999
- I need a sharp knife.
- Why?

1329
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:02,594
To cut things with.

1330
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:04,367
Oh. Cut what up?

1331
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:07,375
I like to cut my food
with a knife.

1332
00:59:07,443 --> 00:59:09,877
We're having spaghetti.
You don't need a knife.

1333
00:59:09,946 --> 00:59:12,642
I don't have one
in the house.

1334
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:14,876
I'm all out--
I got some there.

1335
00:59:14,951 --> 00:59:16,384
That's the woman's
upstairs.

1336
00:59:16,452 --> 00:59:18,682
It's not right for us
to use them.

1337
00:59:18,755 --> 00:59:21,315
She's got emphysema.
So it's a bad idea.

1338
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,325
Al, give me a knife.

1339
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,826
What happened there?

1340
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:26,828
I don't
have a knife.

1341
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,329
I can't find one.

1342
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,229
Oh, you know what?

1343
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:32,461
Use that.
That'll do foryou.

1344
00:59:33,836 --> 00:59:35,861
This is a butter knife.

1345
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:39,275
Yeah. A nice one, too.
An ivory handle.

1346
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,673
Well, I'm not
having butter.

1347
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:43,177
You can
changeyour mind.

1348
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,476
You want butter,
you got the right knife.

1349
00:59:45,548 --> 00:59:47,982
Go back and sing.
Great. Good.

1350
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:53,654
I got to tellyou,
I don't understandit,,,

1351
00:59:53,723 --> 00:59:55,657
I can't see
a damn thing.

1352
00:59:55,725 --> 00:59:59,024
Don't use the binoculars in the house.
You'll hurtyour eyes.

1353
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:02,030
For the amount ofpeople who've seen
Steve Nebraska play,,,

1354
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:03,531
they're talking
about you.

1355
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,534
$55 million dollars,

1356
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:08,036
What about the rumor he's
under a doctor's care?

1357
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:09,469
Turn that down.

1358
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:11,564
How'd they
find that out?

1359
01:00:11,641 --> 01:00:14,303
,,,IfSteve Nebraska
turned out to beJimmy Piersall?

1360
01:00:14,377 --> 01:00:15,469
Who's J immy Piersall?

1361
01:00:15,545 --> 01:00:17,706
Don't worry,
you're not him.

1362
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,372
What did theysay?

1363
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:22,384
Hands down, the fastest
pitcher they've ever seen,

1364
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:24,249
and the best hitter,

1365
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,254
Mmm, what
are you doing?

1366
01:00:26,322 --> 01:00:27,755
They're talking about me.

1367
01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:30,987
We're going to have
to do a press conference.

1368
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:34,359
Al, why? Come on, you said
I wouldn't have to pitch.

1369
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:36,990
Well, you're going to pitch
eventually, aren'tyou?

1370
01:00:37,066 --> 01:00:40,001
Ifwe don't talk to the press,
they'll keep coming.

1371
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:42,731
They'll make everything up,
like the doctor.

1372
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:44,238
But all that's true.

1373
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:47,504
That's true. But it'll
just get worse and worse.

1374
01:00:47,577 --> 01:00:50,512
Next thing you'll know,
you'll be a defector.

1375
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:53,014
They'll haveyou
killing somebody.

1376
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:55,016
That would be cool.

1377
01:00:55,084 --> 01:00:56,847
What does that mean?

1378
01:00:58,588 --> 01:01:00,249
What does what mean?

1379
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,314
Well, that it's
not cool to, uh...

1380
01:01:02,392 --> 01:01:04,326
No, you don't mean that.

1381
01:01:04,394 --> 01:01:06,328
With the money
they're paying you,

1382
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:09,331
you can't throw a ball
and go home to sleep.

1383
01:01:09,399 --> 01:01:11,367
You got to talk
to the press.

1384
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:13,800
Maybe it's not worth it.

1385
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:15,303
Not worth it?

1386
01:01:15,371 --> 01:01:18,204
It works out to
a million dollars a question.

1387
01:01:18,274 --> 01:01:20,708
There's going to be
a million questions,

1388
01:01:20,777 --> 01:01:23,211
and I don't know
all the answers.

1389
01:01:23,279 --> 01:01:25,213
I don't want
to look foolish.

1390
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:27,215
I'll never
let that happen.

1391
01:01:27,283 --> 01:01:29,717
We'll go over stuff,
just like the president.

1392
01:01:29,786 --> 01:01:32,254
He wakes up a fool.
They help him.

1393
01:01:32,321 --> 01:01:35,290
We'll go over stuff.
We'll fill in the blanks.

1394
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:38,885
We'll giveyou a life
you can be proud of.

1395
01:01:41,164 --> 01:01:42,324
- Shh!
- Shh!

1396
01:01:42,398 --> 01:01:45,333
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm sorryforthe delay.

1397
01:01:45,401 --> 01:01:46,834
You all set?

1398
01:01:46,903 --> 01:01:50,339
Hmm? Yeah. Uh, in yourversion,
did I go to college?

1399
01:01:50,406 --> 01:01:53,341
Yes. We decided that.
Avery good one.

1400
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:54,842
Listen to me.

1401
01:01:54,911 --> 01:01:57,345
Ifthey bring up
the therapy at all,

1402
01:01:57,413 --> 01:01:59,108
tell them that, uh,

1403
01:01:59,182 --> 01:02:01,616
tell them it's
notyou, it's me.

1404
01:02:01,684 --> 01:02:03,618
Ifthey bring up
the therapy,

1405
01:02:03,686 --> 01:02:07,122
tell them thatyou're
taking me to the doctor.

1406
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:08,782
What's wrong with you?

1407
01:02:13,196 --> 01:02:15,630
Nothing.
What doyou mean?

1408
01:02:15,698 --> 01:02:18,132
I was just giving
you an answer.

1409
01:02:18,201 --> 01:02:21,295
Ifthey bring up the therapy,
it's notyou.

1410
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:22,302
I'm going.

1411
01:02:22,371 --> 01:02:23,702
I'll need
another note card.

1412
01:02:23,773 --> 01:02:25,502
Just forget it.
Forget it.

1413
01:02:27,477 --> 01:02:29,911
...this press conference
will lay that to rest.

1414
01:02:29,979 --> 01:02:31,640
Now, uh--Oh, O.K.,

1415
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:33,648
I want to giveyou all

1416
01:02:33,716 --> 01:02:37,049
a crack at the new pride of
the Yankees--Steve Nebraska.

1417
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:40,154
Are you in therapy?

1418
01:02:40,223 --> 01:02:42,589
Whyyou in therapy,
Steve?

1419
01:02:42,658 --> 01:02:44,592
Ohh! Time out!

1420
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:47,151
Let's all ask questions
one at a time.

1421
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:49,164
Then we'll
move this along,

1422
01:02:49,232 --> 01:02:52,167
and I can answer
your questions.

1423
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:53,964
Areyou currently
in therapy?

1424
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:55,469
Uh, nope.

1425
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:58,666
You've been seen coming in and out
ofa doctor's office.

1426
01:02:58,741 --> 01:03:03,144
That's because I'm taking
my friend to that office.

1427
01:03:03,212 --> 01:03:04,907
Who, Steve?

1428
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:06,243
Al Percolo.

1429
01:03:06,315 --> 01:03:07,247
Your manager?

1430
01:03:07,316 --> 01:03:08,681
Yeah, that's right.

1431
01:03:08,751 --> 01:03:09,683
What's wrong
with him?

1432
01:03:09,752 --> 01:03:12,687
Uh...nothing.
I'm not a doctor.

1433
01:03:12,755 --> 01:03:13,847

West--Midwest! Ha.

1439
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:25,767
I spent time
in the Mideast.

1440
01:03:25,835 --> 01:03:27,427
How much time?

1441
01:03:27,503 --> 01:03:28,834
I spent...

1442
01:03:28,905 --> 01:03:31,373
sixyears
in the Mideast,

1443
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,873
Wait, hang on minute.

1444
01:03:32,942 --> 01:03:34,375
Areyourparents

1445
01:03:34,443 --> 01:03:35,876

1452
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:48,485

I got to tel I you somethi ng.
You did great.

1454
01:03:51,127 --> 01:03:53,061
You know how hard it is

1455
01:03:53,129 --> 01:03:55,393
to make guys laugh
at a press conference?

1456
01:03:55,464 --> 01:03:56,897
What if they find out

1457
01:03:56,966 --> 01:03:59,332
some of that stuff
I said isn't true?

1458
01:03:59,402 --> 01:04:00,869
How will they find out?

1459
01:04:00,937 --> 01:04:02,199
They're reporters.

1460
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:04,671
The Yankees keep going
like they're going,,,

1461
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:06,469

1462
01:04:06,542 --> 01:04:09,136
The Yankees could be
in the World Series,

1463
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:10,577
Oh, please.

1464
01:04:10,646 --> 01:04:12,978
All New Yorkers are
crossing their fingers,

1465
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:17,486
We hope Steve Nebraska's
the Yankees'gain and Cairo's loss,

1466
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:18,986
And I 'm hungry, too.

1467
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:22,081
How could you be hungry?
You ate 3 0 minutes ago.

1468
01:04:22,158 --> 01:04:23,420
Well, let's eat again.

1469
01:04:23,492 --> 01:04:26,188
No, let's not eat again.

1470
01:04:26,295 --> 01:04:29,230
I got two words
of advice foryou--

1471
01:04:29,298 --> 01:04:31,232
Fernando Valenzuela.

1472
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:34,701
He started out a pitcher,
wound up a truck.

1473
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:36,032
Hello?

1474
01:04:36,105 --> 01:04:38,471
Mr. Percolo,
it's, uh, Dr. Aaron.

1475
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:40,702
I just saw Steve
on television.

1476
01:04:40,776 --> 01:04:42,710
Fantastic, wasn't he?

1477
01:04:42,778 --> 01:04:45,713
I need to seeyou
in my office right away.

1478
01:04:45,781 --> 01:04:48,215
Meet me there
in half an hour.

1479
01:04:48,284 --> 01:04:50,718
No, that'll be tough.
We're going out.

1480
01:04:50,786 --> 01:04:53,778
Steinbrenner's gal got us
tickets forTony Bennett.

1481
01:04:53,856 --> 01:04:54,788
Could this wait?

1482
01:04:54,857 --> 01:04:56,791
It's important.
No, it can't wait.

1483
01:04:56,859 --> 01:04:58,588
One halfhour, please.

1484
01:04:58,661 --> 01:05:00,561
All right,
we'll be there.

1485
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:03,724
I just
need to seeyou.

1486
01:05:03,799 --> 01:05:05,733
Why's that?

1487
01:05:05,801 --> 01:05:07,359
Hello?

1488
01:05:09,939 --> 01:05:11,429
Dr. Aaron!

1489
01:05:16,812 --> 01:05:18,040
Hi.

1490
01:05:18,114 --> 01:05:21,709
Mr. Percolo, I can't be connected
with this anymore.

1491
01:05:21,784 --> 01:05:22,808
That's all.

1492
01:05:22,885 --> 01:05:24,944
What brought this on?

1493
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:27,216
Middle East?
America's Cup?
A Rhodes Scholar?

1494
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:28,587
Where's all that from?

1495
01:05:28,658 --> 01:05:30,592
He was worried
he'd forget stuff.

1496
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:32,594
We went over
a few things.

1497
01:05:32,662 --> 01:05:35,096
This man is trying
to reconnect his life.

1498
01:05:35,164 --> 01:05:36,426
Don't make up stuff.

1499
01:05:36,499 --> 01:05:38,524
I was just trying
to help.

1500
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:41,263
I thinkyou two should
find another doctor.

1501
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:43,271
I'm sorry,
I cannot helpyou.

1502
01:05:43,339 --> 01:05:44,601
You're the only doctor--

1503
01:05:44,674 --> 01:05:45,606
Oh, please.

1504
01:05:45,675 --> 01:05:47,199
Don't take
the letter back.

1505
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:50,712
All right! I don't want
you around him anymore.

1506
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:54,216
Let him come to therapy
by himself.

1507
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:55,875
Oh, new rules.

1508
01:05:59,188 --> 01:06:01,782
You were the one who said,
"Staywith him

1509
01:06:01,857 --> 01:06:04,291
24 hours a day,
he might be dangerous."

1510
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:06,920
I changed my mind.
You might be dangerous.

1511
01:06:06,996 --> 01:06:10,295
I'll accept that. Butyou won't
take the letter back, right?

1512
01:06:10,366 --> 01:06:12,800
Oh, you know...
I don't want to hear

1513
01:06:12,868 --> 01:06:15,268
anything more about the letter.
Goodbye.

1514
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:16,566
Good night.

1515
01:06:23,879 --> 01:06:25,642

01:10:19,415 --> 01:10:21,906
I'll put in my mouth
what I want to.

1608

Fine...butwe're getting up

1609

early in the morning
to practice.

1610
01:10:25,654 --> 01:10:28,122
I thinkyou should get
a good night's sleep.

1611
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:29,623
It's O.K., Steve.

1612
01:10:29,692 --> 01:10:32,126
We can do something
another time.

1613
01:10:32,194 --> 01:10:33,627
Just--
Just a minute.

1614
01:10:33,696 --> 01:10:35,129
I'll be right back.

1615
01:10:36,966 --> 01:10:39,833
Listen, you got to stop
telling me what to do, O.K.?

1616
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:43,099
I'm gonna eat and sleep
when I want to,

1617
01:10:43,172 --> 01:10:45,606
and I'm gonna practice
when I want to!

You got that?

1620
01:11:39,495 --> 01:11:40,427
Hi.

1621
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:45,166
Sorry, the laundry
room is in use now.

1622
01:11:51,907 --> 01:11:52,839
Here.

1623
01:11:52,908 --> 01:11:54,341
What is that?

1624
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:56,605
That's a chocolate
baseball bat.

1625
01:11:56,679 --> 01:11:58,613
I got it foryou.

1626
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:00,478
Did you drop it?

1627
01:12:00,549 --> 01:12:02,483
I--I got
a little hungry.

1628
01:12:02,551 --> 01:12:06,078
Well, I appreciate it.
I'll treasure it always.

1629
01:12:08,924 --> 01:12:10,858
I'm sorry
I yelled atyou.

1630
01:12:10,926 --> 01:12:13,861
I've been going through
a lot ofstuffwith the doctor,

1631
01:12:13,929 --> 01:12:16,363
and it's bringing up
a lot ofstuff,

1632
01:12:16,432 --> 01:12:17,694

about...

01:12:24,606 --> 01:12:27,006
I appreciate the gift.

1637
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:28,008
Thankyou.

1638
01:12:28,077 --> 01:12:30,511
So did you have
a good time?

1639
01:12:30,579 --> 01:12:31,511
Yeah.

1640
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:33,172
Did you go eat again?

1641
01:12:33,248 --> 01:12:36,051
Just the bat.
Don't leave that in the sun.

1642
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:37,709
O.K.

1643
01:12:38,787 --> 01:12:41,051
So, uh...
what'd you guys do?

1644
01:12:41,123 --> 01:12:42,715
Went back
to her place.

1645
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:44,725
Oh.

1646
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:46,727
Did you, um...

1647
01:12:48,564 --> 01:12:51,897
Well, sorry, that's
none of my business.

1648
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:53,366
Did I nail her?

1649
01:12:53,435 --> 01:12:55,995
Well, now thatyou brought it up...
did you?

1650
01:12:56,071 --> 01:12:57,561
No, I didn't.

1651
01:12:57,639 --> 01:12:59,869

protection, don'tyou?

1653
01:13:02,244 --> 01:13:05,509
Oh, no. Now am I going
to get a lecture on this?

1654
01:13:05,581 --> 01:13:07,515
I'm not lecturing.
I'm telling you.

1655
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:09,517
It's a dangerous
world out there.

This is New York,
not Mexico.

1657
01:13:11,587 --> 01:13:12,849
I didn't do anything.

1658
01:13:12,921 --> 01:13:14,855
I'm just saying "if,"
that's all.

1659
01:13:14,923 --> 01:13:15,890

Hmm?

1663
01:13:26,668 --> 01:13:28,101
You should
separate those.

1664
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:30,764
You can't mix
the white one and dark ones.

1665

The dye from the dark ones
gets in thewhite ones.

You're an expert
on laundry?

1667
01:13:35,844 --> 01:13:38,642
Well, actually,
I know a lot about laundry.

1668
01:13:38,714 --> 01:13:42,115
I like doing laundry.
I find it very relaxing.

Al, did you lie to me?

1673

What areyou talking about?

1674
01:13:57,633 --> 01:14:01,797
Well...you said that I wouldn't
have to pitch this year.

1675
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:03,360
I didn't saythat.

some sleep, O.K.?

to pitch, Al.

we need to practice?

01:25:49,077 --> 01:25:50,009
The roof?

1953
01:25:50,078 --> 01:25:51,943
Was it your idea?

1954
01:25:52,013 --> 01:25:54,004
I don't think
the stadium crowd'syet aware

1955
01:25:54,082 --> 01:25:55,049
ofthis dramatic--

1956
01:26:00,588 --> 01:26:02,078
Where are you going?

1957
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:04,591
To see Steve Nebraska.
He's on the roof.

1958
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:06,524
What's going on?

1959
01:26:06,594 --> 01:26:08,027
It's like a fancy entrance.

1960
01:26:08,096 --> 01:26:10,690
He's coming to the mound
from the roof.

1961
01:26:10,765 --> 01:26:13,199
What will they do,
send a helicopter?

1962
01:26:13,268 --> 01:26:14,200
Yes.

1963
01:26:14,269 --> 01:26:16,203
That's exactly
what they're doing.

1964
01:26:16,271 --> 01:26:18,739
Get the chopper
ready, will you?

1965
01:26:18,806 --> 01:26:20,740
I don't know anything
about a chopper.

1966
01:26:20,808 --> 01:26:23,436
Call Steinbrenner.
He'll take care ofit.

1967
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:26,036
Sure. Send it up.
It's a brilliant idea.

1968
01:26:26,114 --> 01:26:28,548
It's the way
it ought to be.

1969
01:26:28,616 --> 01:26:31,551
They're going to bring
Steve down to the mound

1970
01:26:31,619 --> 01:26:33,553
in my helicopter
from the roof.

1971
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:35,054
You can't do that.

1972
01:26:35,123 --> 01:26:37,250
It's show biz.
God, I love it.

1973
01:26:50,338 --> 01:26:51,965
Steve.

1974
01:26:54,576 --> 01:26:55,600
Hey, Al.

1975
01:26:56,878 --> 01:26:59,711
What are you doing,
Steve?

1976
01:27:01,082 --> 01:27:04,017
Uh, I just, um...

1977
01:27:04,085 --> 01:27:05,518
I was, uh...

1978
01:27:05,587 --> 01:27:08,021
I needed
a little fresh air.

1979
01:27:08,089 --> 01:27:10,080
I was feeling
claustrophobic.

1980
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:13,389
You were feeling claustrophobic
out on the field?

1981
01:27:16,564 --> 01:27:19,032
This is what George Steinbrenner
brings to the Yankees,

1982
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:20,829
a real sense
ofexcitement,

1983
01:27:20,902 --> 01:27:23,336
Canyou believe this?
What an entrance,

1984
01:27:23,404 --> 01:27:25,167
You got to hand it
to the guy,

1985
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:26,673
Most teams bring
their pitchers

1986
01:27:26,741 --> 01:27:28,299
in those silly
golf carts,

1987
01:27:28,376 --> 01:27:30,276
but not
George Steinbrenner,

1988
01:27:30,345 --> 01:27:31,778
There 's his chopper
swinging in

1989
01:27:31,846 --> 01:27:33,780
over right field
right now, Bob,

1990
01:27:33,848 --> 01:27:36,976
How about that?
They're givi ng me credit for it.

1991
01:27:37,051 --> 01:27:39,383
Yeah. I wonder whose
idea it really was.

1992
01:27:39,454 --> 01:27:42,321
Well, it's mine now,
stupid.

1993
01:27:55,803 --> 01:27:58,738
I don't feel like
playing tonight, Al.

1994
01:27:58,806 --> 01:28:00,671
Maybe some other time.

1995
01:28:00,742 --> 01:28:02,175
Some other time?

1996
01:28:02,243 --> 01:28:03,505
I see.

1997
01:28:05,079 --> 01:28:08,014
When would
that time be?

1998
01:28:08,082 --> 01:28:09,174
Easter?

1999
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:12,014
Would that be
better foryou?

2000
01:28:12,086 --> 01:28:14,179
How about
Christmas Eve?

2001
01:28:15,490 --> 01:28:17,014
Seems Al Percolo,

2002
01:28:17,091 --> 01:28:19,025
the scout who discovered
Steve Nebraska,

2003
01:28:19,093 --> 01:28:20,560
is up there with him

2004
01:28:20,628 --> 01:28:23,028
giving him some
last-minute words ofwisdom,

2005
01:28:23,097 --> 01:28:24,530
Yeah, andAl Percolo

2006
01:28:24,599 --> 01:28:26,999
has reportedly been under
a psychiatrist's care,

2007
01:28:27,068 --> 01:28:30,333
Unfortunate, but we
hope and pray he 's O, K.,

2008
01:28:30,405 --> 01:28:32,839
What do you thi nk
they're tal ki ng about?

2009
01:28:32,907 --> 01:28:34,340
I t's hard to tell,
Robert.

2010
01:28:34,409 --> 01:28:35,876
Probably strategy,
game plan.

2011
01:28:35,943 --> 01:28:38,434
I don't care
what you feel like!

2012
01:28:38,513 --> 01:28:40,481
What have I been
telling you?

2013
01:28:40,548 --> 01:28:41,981
You're a professional!

2014
01:28:42,050 --> 01:28:45,281
You playwhether
you feel like it or not!

2015
01:28:45,353 --> 01:28:47,787
You're not some
high school kid!

2016
01:28:47,855 --> 01:28:49,288
You're a Yankee!

2017
01:28:49,357 --> 01:28:52,758
Now get down there
and stop being a baby!

2018
01:28:52,827 --> 01:28:54,761
Don'tyou call me
a baby!

2019
01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:58,265
You have no idea what's
going on inside my head!

2020
01:28:58,333 --> 01:28:59,800
I don't care what--

2021
01:28:59,867 --> 01:29:03,303
I don't care what's
going on insideyour head!

2022
01:29:03,371 --> 01:29:04,963
I don't care
about that!

2023
01:29:05,039 --> 01:29:07,269
Ifyou don't stop
yelling at me,

2024
01:29:07,342 --> 01:29:10,277
I'm going to throwyou
offthis fucking roof!.

2025
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:11,778
Throw me off
the roof!.

2026
01:29:11,846 --> 01:29:13,643
I mean it!
I wantyou to!

2027
01:29:13,715 --> 01:29:15,512
Ifl go down
the stairs,

2028
01:29:15,583 --> 01:29:17,016
they put me in jail!

2029
01:29:17,085 --> 01:29:18,746
Ifyou
throw me off,

2030
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:21,516
I'd get a ride
in an ambulance!

2031
01:29:24,092 --> 01:29:26,788
I broke my ass
foryou.

2032
01:29:28,563 --> 01:29:31,623
I discovered you!
I gotyou the deal!

2033
01:29:31,699 --> 01:29:34,133
I found you the doctor!
I feed you!

2034
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:35,794
You staywith me!

2035
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:38,771
This is howyou're
going to repay me?

2036
01:30:02,897 --> 01:30:04,194
Forget it.

2037
01:30:05,733 --> 01:30:06,859
What?

2038
01:30:06,934 --> 01:30:07,992
Forget it.

2039
01:30:08,069 --> 01:30:11,505
I never thought
I'd say this.

2040
01:30:14,075 --> 01:30:15,508
Screw the World Series.

2041
01:30:15,576 --> 01:30:17,635
Ifyou don't
want to pitch,

2042
01:30:17,712 --> 01:30:19,509
don't pitch.

2043
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:21,548
You won't get mad at me?

2044
01:30:21,616 --> 01:30:24,016
No, I won't be mad
atyou.

2045
01:30:24,085 --> 01:30:25,518
Don't worry
about me now.

2046
01:30:25,586 --> 01:30:27,019
I'm sorry I yelled.

2047
01:30:27,088 --> 01:30:28,453
This is your life.

2048
01:30:28,523 --> 01:30:30,514
You do wantyou
want to do.

2049
01:30:30,591 --> 01:30:33,025
I'm nothing in this.
I'm just a stupid scout

2050
01:30:33,094 --> 01:30:35,028
thatwas lucky enough
to seeyou play.

2051
01:30:35,096 --> 01:30:37,360
You're the one
that counts. Not me.

2052
01:30:37,432 --> 01:30:38,956
No.

2053
01:30:41,035 --> 01:30:43,503
Al, you're like
a dad to me.

2054
01:30:43,571 --> 01:30:45,971
But I'm not
your dad.

2055
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:49,271
I'm just a guy
taking 1 5%

2056
01:30:50,545 --> 01:30:52,513
I thought it was 1 0.

2057
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:55,014
No.
1 0 the first 6 months,

2058
01:30:55,082 --> 01:30:56,515
then we bumped--

2059
01:30:56,584 --> 01:30:58,484
Well, what difference
does it make?

2060
01:30:58,553 --> 01:31:00,544
You're not going to
play anyway.

2061
01:31:00,621 --> 01:31:02,987
Come on.
Let's get out ofhere.

2062
01:31:04,559 --> 01:31:06,186
Still be my friend?

2063
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:07,693
Yeah,
I'll beyour friend.

2064
01:31:07,762 --> 01:31:09,195
I'm sure
we'll be closer

2065
01:31:09,263 --> 01:31:12,061
since nobodywill want
to talk to either of us.

2066
01:31:12,133 --> 01:31:15,125
I really appreciate
this, Al. I do.

2067
01:31:18,673 --> 01:31:21,335
Who's going to pitch
ifl don't?

2068
01:31:21,409 --> 01:31:23,001
Oh, let's notworry
about the lineup now.

2069
01:31:23,077 --> 01:31:26,012
The only lineupwe should
be concerned about

2070
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,513
is the police lineup.

2071
01:31:27,582 --> 01:31:30,210
Ifl pitched, what's theworst
that could happen?

2072
01:31:32,086 --> 01:31:33,951
You'd lose.

2073
01:31:34,021 --> 01:31:35,079
I'd lose.

2074
01:31:36,991 --> 01:31:38,117
I'd lose.

2075
01:31:41,028 --> 01:31:42,962
Well, that's not so bad

2076
01:31:43,030 --> 01:31:46,466
'cause halfthe guys
down there lose every night.

2077
01:31:46,534 --> 01:31:47,466
Yeah.

2078
01:31:47,535 --> 01:31:49,469
I wouldn't aim
for it,

2079
01:31:49,537 --> 01:31:51,971
but that's all
thatwould happen.

2080
01:31:52,039 --> 01:31:53,973
Well, maybe I should try.

2081
01:31:55,376 --> 01:31:58,470
Yeah. I want to do it.
Let's pitch.

2082
01:31:58,546 --> 01:31:59,570
You sure?

2083
01:31:59,647 --> 01:32:02,241
Yeah. What areyou doing
later on?

2084
01:32:02,316 --> 01:32:04,307
I don't have
any plans, no.

2085
01:32:05,553 --> 01:32:07,817
Maybe we could do
some laundry.

2086
01:32:07,889 --> 01:32:09,789
You love that laundry,
don'tyou?

2087
01:32:09,857 --> 01:32:10,915
I do.

2088
01:32:10,992 --> 01:32:12,983
I got a deal
foryou.

2089
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:15,654
You go pitch,
I'll buy the bleach.

2090
01:32:15,730 --> 01:32:17,664
You don't get it,
doyou?

2091
01:32:17,732 --> 01:32:18,994
You don't need bleach.

2092
01:32:19,066 --> 01:32:20,761
People spend money
on stuff

2093
01:32:20,835 --> 01:32:22,268
they really don't need.

2094
01:32:22,336 --> 01:32:23,963
You get a lemon,

2095
01:32:24,038 --> 01:32:26,506
cut it in half,
get a little salt--

2096
01:32:26,574 --> 01:32:28,007
Go play ball.

2097
01:32:28,075 --> 01:32:30,839
We can talk bleach
for hours later.

2098
01:32:30,912 --> 01:32:32,504
What areyou doing?

2099
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:35,549
King Kong wouldn't
take the stairs.

2100
01:32:35,616 --> 01:32:38,483
Your chariot awaits you.

2101
01:32:41,989 --> 01:32:43,513
Go get 'em.

2102
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:00,571
The Yankee
copter's pilot

2103
01:33:00,641 --> 01:33:02,575
has dropped
a rope ladder down,

2104
01:33:02,643 --> 01:33:04,577
Too dangerous to land
on the stadium roof

2105
01:33:04,645 --> 01:33:06,203
with all that
electrical equipment,

2106
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:07,713
But, look, it's working,

2107
01:33:07,782 --> 01:33:08,806
They're lifting off

2108
01:33:08,883 --> 01:33:10,316
and taking Steve along

2109
01:33:10,384 --> 01:33:11,578
for the ride,

2110
01:33:11,652 --> 01:33:13,087
1, 000 feet over
the playing field,

2111
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:15,085
He 's made it
to the cabin,

2112
01:33:15,156 --> 01:33:17,920
The pilot's checking for
a safe landing on the field,

2113
01:33:17,992 --> 01:33:20,586
Steve Nebraska headi ng
down toward the mound.

2114
01:33:20,661 --> 01:33:22,629
This is it. Game time.

2115
01:33:40,014 --> 01:33:42,039
Nebraska! Nebraska!

2116
01:33:42,116 --> 01:33:43,879
Nebraska! Nebraska!

2117
01:33:43,951 --> 01:33:45,851
Nebraska! Nebraska!

2118
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:48,388
Nebraska! Nebraska!

2119
01:33:48,456 --> 01:33:49,923
Nebraska! Nebraska!

2120
01:33:49,991 --> 01:33:52,391
Nebraska! Nebraska!

2121
01:33:54,762 --> 01:33:56,195
All right,
baseball fans,

2122
01:33:56,263 --> 01:33:58,561
Your long wait
isjust about over,

2123
01:33:58,633 --> 01:34:00,601
All the anticipation,
all the speculation,

2124
01:34:00,668 --> 01:34:03,899
and now, finally,
the moment has arrived,

Strike 2, This one
is clocked at 1 06,

2140
01:34:39,607 --> 01:34:41,040
Ifthis keeps up,

2141
01:34:41,108 --> 01:34:43,542
they'll have to
reinvent the radar gun

2142
01:34:43,611 --> 01:34:45,806
when it comes to
young Steve Nebraska,

2143
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:50,044

Here he comes,
Steve Nebraska's first time at bat,

2149
01:35:14,208 --> 01:35:16,108
Tewksbury a much different
kind ofpitcher

2150
01:35:16,177 --> 01:35:17,269

2151
01:35:17,344 --> 01:35:19,209

breaking ball guy,

2152
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:20,577
Iikes to mix it up,

Has to be 425 feet
ifit's an inch,

2158
01:35:31,926 --> 01:35:33,860
And, yes, Steve Nebraska
can swing the bat

2159
01:35:33,928 --> 01:35:36,328
as well as toss
the horsehide,

2160
01:35:36,397 --> 01:35:37,523

2163
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:46,039
from becoming
the first pitcher in history

2164
01:35:46,107 --> 01:35:49,042

a mind-boggling feat--

2165
01:35:49,110 --> 01:35:52,409

2167
01:35:53,981 --> 01:35:55,972
And look who's advancing
to the plate--

2168
01:35:56,050 --> 01:35:57,483
Ozzie Smith himself,

2169
01:35:57,551 --> 01:35:59,041
0 for 2 tonight,

2170
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:01,054
but five homers

2171
01:36:01,122 --> 01:36:03,556

01:36:07,461 --> 01:36:09,895
Ozzie Smith could
be the guy to do it,

2175
01:36:09,964 --> 01:36:13,422
Nebraska peers in
at the Wizard of Oz,

2176
01:36:13,501 --> 01:36:17,267
rocks into his motion
and delivers--Oh, man!
