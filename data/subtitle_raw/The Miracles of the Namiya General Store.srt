00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,090
I found a vacant building

Hold this.

It's open.

58
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:26,840
Give me that.

Who cares?

66
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,650
She wanted the orphanage
to become a love hotel.

67
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,490
I guess so.

00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,880

83
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,930

00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,880
It must be a prank.

Someone wants to spook us cuz we broke in.

103
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,590
What kind of prank is that?

104
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,460
Forget that.

105
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:19,100

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,970

Mom and Dad are already there.

139
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,930
You have a suit?

140
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:41,870
I borrowed one.

Sorry?

151
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,910
I quit the university.

152
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:14,990
Why would you want to do that?

153
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:18,260
He's a musician in Tokyo.

154
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,000
A musician! Can you make a living?

155
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,630
Not yet...

156
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:31,780

00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,730
Dad!

165
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:56,730
What am I saying that's so bad?

166
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,660
I'm worried about your husband's health.

167
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:06,870
Sorry, everyone...

168
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,910

"You'll score 100. From Mr. Namiya"

174
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:07,400
That's bogus advice!

175
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,810
You're a wise man, Mr. Namiya.

176
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,540
You can pay me by buying a notebook!

177
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,040

Katsuro, the bath is ready!

182
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,210
Hey, bro.

183
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:50,780
Bath.

184
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:07,160
Is the Namiya General Store still open?

185
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,870
It closed. No one's there anymore.

186
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,860
What happened to the old man?

187
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:17,210
He closed the shop

188
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:19,680
and went to live with his son's family.

189
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:23,970
Remember the advice he used to give?

190
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,310
The more personal advice went in the milk box.

191
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,020
Did other kids look in the box?

192
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,490
No.

193
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:39,360
Not even the bad kids. We had an agreement.

194
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,870
Dear, Mr. Namiya.

195
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:26,880
to my mentor, John Lennon died yesterday.

196
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:31,770
I don't know what you think of the Beatles but

197
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:36,650
I was one of the impressionable fans
who got a guitar.

198
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,520
Three years ago I quit
school to take up music.

199
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:44,930
I've come to a crossroad.

200
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:00,610
"Dear..."

201
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:07,020
"Fishmonger/Musician"

202
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,290
then what?

203
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:10,510
Go for it!

204
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,010
That's stupid.

205
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,300
This dreamer needs a reality check

206
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,230
for his own sake.

207
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,290
You write it. Shota.

208
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:27,940
OK.

209
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,480
Are you satisfied?

210
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:16,520
Dear Fishmonger/Musician.

211
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:22,090
I read your letter where you sought advice.

212
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,130
With your family trade to fall back on,

213
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:29,330
it's a luxurious problem.

214
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:36,130
Not many people can make
a living from music.

215
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:48,090
What can I get you?

216
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:49,910
4 dried fish.

217
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,490
Right away!

218
00:22:54,990 --> 00:23:00,060
My family's fish shop
hardly makes any money.

219
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:05,330
So investing in myself seems sensible.

220
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:38,330
God, he's clueless.

221
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:07,630
I know nothing about your music but

222
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:09,730
I sure know that you have no talent.

223
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:14,560
You worked on your music
for three years and gotten nowhere.

224
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,920
I'm not doing this as a hobby.

225
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:40,360
I'd like you to listen to my music.

226
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,140
Will he write back?

227
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,040
I'll wait outside.

228
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,600
No. You might be seen.

229
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,090
This is Seri's song!

230
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:25,290
I'd like you to listen to my song.

231
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:31,220
It's that song.

232
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,230
Yes.

233
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:38,400
If he wrote that song.

234
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,270
he must have saved Seri's brother.

235
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:48,040
I have to write to Fishmonger/Musician.

236
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,920
What will I say?

237
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,790
"Dear, Fishmonger..."

238
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:08,430
Katsuro!

239
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:12,760
Where have you been?

240
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:16,530
Dad collapsed again!

241
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,250
Thank you for waiting.

242
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,490
Doctor.

243
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,960
I'll show you the X-ray
and cardiograph results.

244
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,300
there's no abnormality.

245
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:43,270
I'd say it is fatigue.

246
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,770
His heart is working overtime.

247
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:16,760
Son, go back to Tokyo now.

248
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,100
Don't say that.

249
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:34,410
You should relax and get some rest.

250
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,680
Mind your own business.

251
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:50,500
If you insist on going back to work

252
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:54,510
I'll help with the shop.

253
00:30:56,610 --> 00:31:01,200
What about your music?

254
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,640
Well...

255
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,310
I'll give it up.

256
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:15,320
I'll be the last fishmonger in the family.

257
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,730
You don't want me to take over?

258
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,330
Don't be silly!

259
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:35,940
If you wanted to be a fishmonger.
that's one thing.

260
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,850
But you don't!

261
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,780
I guess not...

262
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:48,720
Son.

263
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:56,190
You decided to pursue
music and quit college...

264
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:02,400
It's only been three years.

265
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:14,680
Try again, like your life depends on it.

266
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,750
You're up against Tokyo.

267
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:27,590
It doesn't matter if you lose
as long as you try your best.

268
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:33,860
Leave your mark in the world.

269
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,140
there's something I want you to know.

270
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:14,840
You definitely shouldn't give up music.

271
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:21,910
It has the power to save people.

272
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:27,160
And your music will be long remembered.

273
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,700
"Eight years later"

274
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,850
I'm here to perform for the kids.

275
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,720
I'm Minazuki. The manager.

276
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,390
Welcome!

277
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,220
May I?

278
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:05,060
- It's OK.
- Let me.

279
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,230
Say hello!

280
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:07,730
Hello.

281
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:09,900
Follow me.

282
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,440
Seri.

283
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:16,130
OK. Now for the next song.

284
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,450
Hello.

285
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:46,290
What's the name of the
second song you performed?

286
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:51,220
Huh. That's a song I wrote myself.

287
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,260
What's it called?

288
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:56,930
Reborn.

289
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,100
It's about being born again.

290
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,930
The kids loved it.

291
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:24,560
Another success. It was great.

292
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,560
Thank you.

293
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:33,070
Um, the girl who just talked to me...

294
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:34,930
You mean Seri?

295
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:40,680
She and her brother joined us a year ago.

296
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:48,420
They were abused by their parents.

297
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:53,650
Her brother Tatsutoshi only speaks to her.

298
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:56,150
Bad news.

299
00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:02,830
A power failure has halted the train services.

300
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,500
What bad timing!

301
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:13,080
You can stay here. We have a spare room.

302
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,010
- I'm OK.
- Go on.

303
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:22,410
I'm impressed!
You heard it once and you remember it.

304
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:27,150
Will you become a professional musician?

305
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:31,750
I am trying hard...

306
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:36,060
But sometimes plans don't work out.

307
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:40,030
Please don't give up.

308
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:44,070
I won't give up music.

309
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:49,570
I've got nothing to lose now!

310
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:54,480
When my dad died I promised

311
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:58,780
to believe in myself.

312
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:11,500
It's cold! Let's go back.

313
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:37,080
Will you become a professional musician?

314
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:56,470
It's an emergency! Get up now!

315
00:40:56,710 --> 00:41:01,310
There's a fire! You have to get out!

316
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,990
Come on. This way!

317
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,820
Come on!

318
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:18,130
Hurry up!

319
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:23,130
Calm down, everyone!

320
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:24,960
Is everyone here?

321
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:25,970
My brother!

322
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:28,610
What? Don't go!

323
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,300
Tatsutoshi!

324
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,810
Where is your brother?

325
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:40,280
He goes out to the balcony
when he can't sleep!

326
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:42,550
Seri, it's dangerous.

327
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:44,710
- Hold this!
- Tatsutoshi!

328
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,690
Hey!

329
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:59,040
Tatsutoshi, answer me!

330
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:05,000
- Hey!
- Seri!

331
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,870
Help me, Seri!

332
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:13,880
Hey, here you are!

333
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:19,060
It's OK, let's go.

334
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,860
Come on.

335
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:51,520
Cover your mouth. Let's go.

336
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:06,590
Go!

337
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:19,620
Tatsutoshi!

338
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:38,100
Katsuro...

339
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:43,000
Oh. no!

340
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:48,350
Katsuro...

341
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,010
Katsuro!

342
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,520
Katsuro!

343
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:04,420
Katsuro!

344
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:22,170
Dad, do you think I left my mark in the world?

345
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:25,580
I didn't win but...

346
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:48,400
Thank you!

347
00:44:56,350 --> 00:44:57,910
Thank you very much.

348
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:03,650
OK, now for the next song...

349
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:09,050
The composer of this song
taught me to believe in myself.

350
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:14,500
Katsuro Matsuoka wrote the music
and I wrote the lyrics.

351
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:18,730
He's the man

352
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:23,840
who sacrificed his life to save my brother.

353
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:27,040
I hope you like it. It's called Reborn.

354
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:39,680
"From you I learned the way of life"

355
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:44,960
"That I can't ever forget"

356
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:53,600
"Remnant of your precious love"

357
00:45:54,310 --> 00:46:00,470
"Don't need solitude"

358
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:05,380
"I just pull a faint smile"

359
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:12,480
"And embrace the night"

360
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:16,350
"fading from the view"

361
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:25,300
"Cause in my heart I know"

362
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:32,140
"You're always here with me"

363
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:39,210
"Cause in my bones I feel"

364
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:46,050
"An invisible power levitating me"

365
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:52,030
"Someday again"

366
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,960
"We'll find each other"

367
00:46:56,100 --> 00:47:01,040
"So say goodbye till then"

368
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:12,450
"Though I can't touch you anymore"

369
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:17,380
"I still feel you in the air"

370
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:26,190
"this song is the proof of life we led"

371
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:32,800
"With these words on my lips"

372
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:41,610
"I'll sing for you instead"

373
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:48,780
"Yes. from the bottom of my heart"

374
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:57,760
"Ever wondered where"

375
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:04,860
"You and I came from?"

376
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:11,670
"All on board this ship of life"

377
00:48:14,510 --> 00:48:18,510
"Where do we go from here?"

378
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:24,520
"You handed me this torch"

379
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:28,590
"Now it's my turn"

380
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:33,030
"To pass it on to someone"

381
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:42,440
"Don't be sad. Don't lose faith"

382
00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:49,340
"Don't look back. Don't be scared"

383
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:56,180
"Don't stop trying. Don't quit just yet"

384
00:48:56,390 --> 00:49:00,520
"I want to live"

385
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:07,500
"As you did"

386
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:16,810
"Cause in my heart I know"

387
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:23,750
"You'll be reborn"

388
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:30,680
"And wait for me"

389
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:36,120
"Somewhere in eternity"

390
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:39,330
I hope he received our letters...

391
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:47,500
"Welcome back. Seri!"

392
00:49:55,010 --> 00:50:00,510
Is it a coincidence that
Seri knew the Fishmonger/Musician?

393
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:03,790
And that Seri like us was at

394
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:05,380
Maruko Orphanage?

395
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:08,580
I don't know.

396
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:14,870
If we warn the Fishmonger/Musician
about the fire.

397
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:16,170
He'll live.

398
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:18,330
But Seri's brother might die.

399
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:23,200
If we wrote and told him,
he'd never believe it.

400
00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:25,510
The facts around Seri

401
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:29,350
and the fire are impossible to change.

402
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:35,750
The old man must've agonized over his advice.

403
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:38,620
Like we are.

404
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:44,530
It was just his hobby.

405
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:49,700
But his advice could have
altered people's lives.

406
00:50:50,370 --> 00:50:52,840
What a big responsibility.

407
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:05,940
This might work...

408
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:08,150
Maybe.

409
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:13,090
Here we go.

410
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:18,700
It still works.

411
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,830
"January, 1980"

412
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:24,770
Dad?

413
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:25,900
In here!

414
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:37,780
You still write advice?

415
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:41,480
As long as the letters keep coming.

416
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:44,420
- Can I have a beer?
- Sure.

417
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:50,760
Want one?

418
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:52,760
Maybe later.

419
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:10,310
Did you receive a difficult problem?

420
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:21,220
A woman of 25 and her married lover...

421
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:23,060
That's serious!

422
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:30,600
Though it is yet to be born

423
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:34,800
I already love my baby so much.

424
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:42,050
But is it unfair to raise
a child without a dad?

425
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:48,710
I apologize for burdening
you with my problem.

426
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,050
But there's no one else I can ask.

427
00:52:53,960 --> 00:53:00,020
I'd appreciate your thoughts.
Kind regards, Green River.

428
00:53:08,110 --> 00:53:10,470
Let's see...

429
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:18,940
If it's true, she should get an abortion.

430
00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:24,560
Ms. Green River...

431
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:30,690
She knows she should abort
but she's looking for options.

432
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:35,700
Dad.

433
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,730
You should move in with us.

434
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:50,310
Fumiko is concerned
about your health. you know.

435
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:57,050
Did you hear?

436
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,200
Ouch...

437
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:15,710
Are you OK?

438
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:19,270
I'm fine.

439
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:24,940
Can I have a beer?

440
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:31,880
Hello, there!

441
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:35,760
"Autumn, 1980"

442
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:43,160
Hello.

443
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:45,170
the days are getting shorter!

444
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:48,670
Right. Does that make my life shorter?

445
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,330
- Tofu tonight?
- Hot pot.

446
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:52,640
Nice!

447
00:54:53,110 --> 00:54:54,810
Ouch!

448
00:54:56,110 --> 00:54:58,850
- What's wrong?
- My stomach!

449
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:02,350
- Are you OK?
- Can you get help?

450
00:55:02,490 --> 00:55:04,790
Hang in there!

451
00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:12,320
See here and here?

452
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:17,300
It's pancreatic cancer.
He has about three months left.

453
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:27,410
Let's not tell Dad.

454
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:32,340
Or should we?

455
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:36,190
I don't know what to do.

456
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,520
This is tough.

457
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:41,920
"Mom drowns. Suicide suspected."

458
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:45,010
"Midori Kawabe"

459
00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:55,730
Mr. Namiya.

460
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:57,330
Let's go back.

461
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:41,040
"At 7:00 PM on December 24"

462
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:45,720
"an economy car drove into the sea

463
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:47,650
in Tokigoe city."

464
00:57:47,950 --> 00:57:50,860
"A rescue attempt failed

465
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:52,880
to save the driver."

466
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:57,200
"An infant was thrown from

467
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,500
the car and survived"

468
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:04,440
"Police suspect suicide

469
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:07,840
as the brakes weren't applied."

470
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:15,200
Look at the dead mother's name.

471
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:23,990
Is she...?

472
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:30,150
the woman I gave advice to...

473
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,330
I think it's Ms. Green River.

474
00:58:40,170 --> 00:58:44,440
For many years...

475
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:51,080
I gave advice to people with problems.

476
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:58,880
Is it possible...?

477
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:03,920
Say someone had a problem...

478
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:11,730
Then I gave them advice that
they followed exactly.

479
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:22,570
But that could have put them
in a worse situation.

480
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:27,880
I realized that's how it could end up.

481
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:36,890
As for me...recently

482
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:42,420
I've been having strange dreams every night.

483
00:59:44,570 --> 00:59:50,570
People come to the shop to drop letters

484
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:53,580
in the mail slot.

485
00:59:54,650 --> 01:00:00,680
And I'm watching from elsewhere.

486
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:05,390
That's not all.

487
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:10,720
It's happening in the distant future.

488
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:18,730
It happens decades from now.

489
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:22,370
The people who come and

490
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:26,900
drop letters in the mail slot...

491
01:00:27,950 --> 01:00:32,780
People who'd asked my advice in the past.

492
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:36,490
And I gave them advice.

493
01:00:39,490 --> 01:00:44,450
Because it had a profound
impact on their lives...

494
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:47,100
they're letting me know.

495
01:00:55,010 --> 01:00:59,670
the dreams aren't just dreams.

496
01:01:02,610 --> 01:01:04,310
I know it.

497
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:10,340
that's why I know if I go to the shop

498
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:16,630
there will be letters from those people

499
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:20,460
waiting for me.

500
01:01:24,370 --> 01:01:28,310
So please, Takayuki.

501
01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:33,470
Please...

502
01:01:35,550 --> 01:01:39,480
take me to the shop.

503
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:46,590
Do you think

504
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:52,050
the sickness has made me lose my mind?

505
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,500
I don't have much longer.

506
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:00,030
Dad...

507
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:04,030
This is...

508
01:02:05,410 --> 01:02:10,440
my last favor.

509
01:02:10,850 --> 01:02:12,280
OK?

510
01:02:15,790 --> 01:02:17,420
Please take me

511
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:21,690
to the shop.

512
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:25,360
Please take me.

513
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:30,460
This is my will.

514
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:39,100
You can read it now.

515
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,870
Thank you.

516
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:58,450
Thank you.

517
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:06,290
You can go back, Takayuki.

518
01:04:07,130 --> 01:04:08,960
I'll wait here.

519
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,190
Okay.

520
01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:08,600
On the 33rd anniversary of my death

521
01:05:09,310 --> 01:05:14,150
I want the following announcement to be made.

522
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:17,980
On the XXth day of the month XX...

523
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:22,680
Fill in the XX with the date of my death.

524
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:28,160
Between midnight and daybreak

525
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:33,520
I, Mr. Namiya. will return to give advice.

526
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:39,430
I have a favor to ask of those who

527
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:43,170
visited my shop for advice.

528
01:05:43,850 --> 01:05:45,680
Was my advice

529
01:05:46,110 --> 01:05:51,520
helpful to you in the course of your life?

530
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:56,760
I'd appreciate your honest responses.

531
01:05:57,130 --> 01:06:03,590
Drop your letter in the mail slot
just like you used to.

532
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:07,260
Accept my gratitude in advance.

533
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:25,740
Takayuki?

534
01:06:26,790 --> 01:06:29,420
I'll be mad if this is a prank.

535
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:55,480
Akiko...!

536
01:07:57,250 --> 01:07:59,370
I've always watched over you.

537
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:01,510
Always...

538
01:08:05,090 --> 01:08:10,320
So you know my life was typical
of a boring man like me.

539
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:23,560
That's why my wife's life

540
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:26,900
wasn't easy.

541
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:34,040
But Mrs. Namiya says her life was so happy.

542
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:37,010
Oh, I wonder about that.

543
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:49,760
I hope you don't mind me
speaking to your husband, Mrs. Namiya.

544
01:08:52,570 --> 01:08:55,300
It has been 50 years.

545
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:01,810
50 years...

546
01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:06,250
How time flew...

547
01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:13,750
Back then

548
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:18,550
I made it hard for you, Akiko.

549
01:09:19,930 --> 01:09:22,450
It was not your fault, Yuji.

550
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:26,300
It was me who wanted to elope with you.

551
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:43,580
...Yes I know. My son, Takayuki

552
01:09:43,950 --> 01:09:49,290
was a quiet boy but he wasn't a loser.

553
01:09:50,530 --> 01:09:54,790
Was it when he was in 4th grade...?

554
01:09:55,060 --> 01:09:57,930
He mastered the pullover on the bars.

555
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:03,240
And the smile on his
face when he did it...!

556
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:06,410
I'll never forget it.

557
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:08,400
He learned at his own pace.

558
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:11,940
As for my wife and I...

559
01:10:12,110 --> 01:10:17,610
I guess we spoiled him.

560
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:25,120
My general store is worthless...

561
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:29,460
But to me it's as valuable as a castle.

562
01:10:31,130 --> 01:10:34,930
You helped many people in your life.

563
01:10:35,670 --> 01:10:37,700
The letters prove it.

564
01:10:37,870 --> 01:10:40,810
I really didn't do much.

565
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:55,680
"Dear Mr. Namiya"

566
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:57,520
I hope you remember me.

567
01:10:58,230 --> 01:11:03,030
I asked you how to score
100 points on every test.

568
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:05,160
I'm the 100-point Kid. "Your Test"

569
01:11:05,730 --> 01:11:09,430
Your advice inspired me to new heights.

570
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,700
And I became a teacher.

571
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:18,010
I made sure all my students scored 100 points.

572
01:11:18,380 --> 01:11:22,180
the parents were supportive of my method

573
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:28,510
and I'm now the Headmaster
at Tokigoe Junior High.

574
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:36,020
I suppose Mr. Namiya's family
will get this letter.

575
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:41,260
I'd appreciate it if you
could put this on his shrine.

576
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:54,510
Dear Mr. Namiya.

577
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:02,590
I learned about your return on the Net

578
01:12:04,330 --> 01:12:07,590
and felt compelled to write to you.

579
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,430
"Maruko Orphanage"

580
01:12:11,130 --> 01:12:15,700
I grew up in an orphanage.

581
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:20,700
My caregivers told me

582
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:26,410
that my mom died in a
car accident when I was a baby.

583
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:29,010
Are you scared?

584
01:12:29,250 --> 01:12:30,080
Then...

585
01:12:30,250 --> 01:12:31,910
I'm with you.

586
01:12:32,190 --> 01:12:34,750
I was in my first year at high school.

587
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:37,690
In social studies

588
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:43,000
we researched events
around the time of our births.

589
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:48,000
I looked through old newspapers.

590
01:12:50,710 --> 01:12:53,170
I found an article.

591
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:59,940
The woman in the article was Midori Kawabe.

592
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:02,810
She was my mom.

593
01:13:05,290 --> 01:13:09,920
That came as such a big shock
that I just lost it.

594
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:32,170
Knock. knock!

595
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:45,610
Eiko.

596
01:14:49,990 --> 01:14:51,220
Seri...

597
01:14:59,230 --> 01:15:01,140
It's so nice out.

598
01:15:03,770 --> 01:15:06,800
The breeze smells of spring.

599
01:15:18,290 --> 01:15:20,620
I talked to the orphanage manager.

600
01:15:23,690 --> 01:15:27,090
He told me why you first came to

601
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:29,990
the orphanage and how your mom died.

602
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,830
You understand nothing.

603
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:46,140
But I know everything.

604
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:51,980
I'm a love child.

605
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:58,520
She tried to kill me... My own mother.

606
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:01,830
You're wrong.

607
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:21,680
Here.

608
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:26,850
the Manager kept this for you.

609
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:29,560
"to Ms. Green River"

610
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:59,580
It was found in my mother's belongings.

611
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:04,920
It was your reply to her, Mr. Namiya.

612
01:17:05,990 --> 01:17:07,860
"More than anything"

613
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:13,230
"the child's welfare is important."

614
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:18,940
"Would you put your child's
happiness before anything?"

615
01:17:19,210 --> 01:17:24,910
"Without that resolve
you shouldn't have a child."

616
01:17:25,950 --> 01:17:30,910
Your mom kept that letter with her.

617
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:37,420
That means

618
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:43,290
your mom decided to put
your happiness first.

619
01:17:44,770 --> 01:17:47,330
She wouldn't commit suicide.

620
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:01,310
On the day of the crash

621
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:06,280
she'd been working night and day.

622
01:18:07,690 --> 01:18:11,820
I had a fever and in order
to take me to the doctor...

623
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:13,090
Midori.

624
01:18:13,290 --> 01:18:16,320
...she'd borrowed her friend's car.

625
01:18:17,170 --> 01:18:18,330
Thank you.

626
01:18:19,430 --> 01:18:20,990
We'll be there soon.

627
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:26,160
That's what her friend told the police.

628
01:18:30,110 --> 01:18:33,240
She didn't commit suicide.

629
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:36,810
She just fell asleep.

630
01:18:45,260 --> 01:18:47,560
Eiko, your mom...

631
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:51,230
She tried so hard to raise you.

632
01:18:52,230 --> 01:18:53,860
So what?

633
01:18:57,110 --> 01:18:59,900
She virtually made the accident happen.

634
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:07,350
If I hadn't been born
she wouldn't have had the accident!

635
01:19:14,060 --> 01:19:15,390
Eiko.

636
01:19:17,790 --> 01:19:19,890
Do you remember the fire?

637
01:19:30,710 --> 01:19:36,010
Remember Katsuro Matsuoka,
the musician who played for us?

638
01:19:38,850 --> 01:19:40,340
He...

639
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:46,050
He sacrificed his
life to save my brother.

640
01:19:48,790 --> 01:19:50,880
That's why from now on...

641
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:56,400
I'll live my life
in gratitude to him.

642
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:05,400
I don't want anyone to die...

643
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:09,130
...you included.

644
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:23,050
Eiko, I want you to know
how precious you are.

645
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:28,390
And how much your mom wanted you.

646
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:42,570
Eiko.

647
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:03,120
You and I...

648
01:21:06,030 --> 01:21:08,630
We have a great future ahead.

649
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:15,900
Why don't we believe that?

650
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:44,640
"Ever since that day
I accepted Mom's love"

651
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:49,540
"and I live my life to its fullest."

652
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:57,840
"I can say this with confidence now."

653
01:22:00,690 --> 01:22:03,850
"I'm so glad I was born."

654
01:22:06,890 --> 01:22:09,490
"From Green River's daughter."

655
01:22:18,270 --> 01:22:21,710
I feel like I received

656
01:22:24,910 --> 01:22:30,110
a wonderful reward at the end of my life.

657
01:23:00,110 --> 01:23:05,420
Looks like another letter was posted.

658
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:07,420
Let's see.

659
01:24:31,810 --> 01:24:38,270
I was here the whole time
you were in the shop, Dad.

660
01:24:39,110 --> 01:24:43,550
And no one was anywhere near the shop.

661
01:24:45,690 --> 01:24:47,350
Of course not.

662
01:24:48,420 --> 01:24:51,520
Because all these letters

663
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:55,360
were sent from the future.

664
01:25:11,450 --> 01:25:17,680
People learned from the Net
that I was returning for advice.

665
01:25:17,850 --> 01:25:19,720
What's the Net?

666
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:22,180
I don't know.

667
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:27,190
How will the world
change in the future...?

668
01:25:31,420 --> 01:25:33,980
What kind of man was Mr. Namiya?

669
01:25:35,190 --> 01:25:36,050
I don't know.

670
01:25:36,690 --> 01:25:40,060
Maybe he started giving advice

671
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:42,550
because he was lonely?

672
01:25:42,830 --> 01:25:44,800
Who wants to know?

673
01:25:46,060 --> 01:25:47,830
Oh, it's out!

674
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:53,340
We got one!

675
01:25:56,840 --> 01:25:57,830
"To Mr. Namiya"

676
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:07,010
Dear, Mr. Namiya.

677
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:11,120
I recently graduated from high school.

678
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:13,650
I'm an office clerk by day

679
01:26:13,860 --> 01:26:16,490
and a club hostess at night.

680
01:26:16,490 --> 01:26:18,490
I'm a lost puppy.

681
01:26:19,230 --> 01:26:23,690
A client offered to
help me start a business

682
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:26,530
if I agreed to be his mistress.

683
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:29,000
Now I'm in a fix.

684
01:26:29,910 --> 01:26:33,710
I'm an orphan and I need a lot of money

685
01:26:33,910 --> 01:26:37,870
so I can repay my foster parents.

686
01:26:38,250 --> 01:26:43,620
Yours truly. Lost Puppy,
December 12, 1980.

687
01:26:46,390 --> 01:26:47,550
No way!

688
01:26:49,430 --> 01:26:52,060
This one's from 1980, too!

689
01:26:55,130 --> 01:26:57,190
What are you up to, Kohei?

690
01:26:57,900 --> 01:26:59,100
I'll answer.

691
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:02,540
To a greedy mistress?

692
01:27:03,010 --> 01:27:06,100
I'll tell her not to work in a club.

693
01:27:06,310 --> 01:27:09,440
You have to be more specific.

694
01:27:09,650 --> 01:27:11,740
What's wrong with you guys?

695
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:18,190
We're fugitives.

696
01:27:18,190 --> 01:27:20,780
Who needs advice from losers like us?

697
01:27:21,190 --> 01:27:22,350
Be quiet!

698
01:27:23,830 --> 01:27:25,130
Whatever.

699
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:32,060
She'll be tricked by various men

700
01:27:32,270 --> 01:27:34,970
and end up being a single mom

701
01:27:34,970 --> 01:27:37,240
to a no-good kid.

702
01:27:43,380 --> 01:27:45,010
Just like you.

703
01:27:49,420 --> 01:27:51,050
Say that again.

704
01:27:51,890 --> 01:27:54,120
She's not your mother!

705
01:27:54,330 --> 01:27:56,120
- She's...
- Stop!

706
01:27:57,760 --> 01:27:59,660
Same goes for you too!

707
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:09,810
A baby left in a locker...

708
01:28:10,010 --> 01:28:10,840
Stop it.

709
01:28:18,250 --> 01:28:23,050
A mother who loses it
and abuses her own kid.

710
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:33,490
What advice is there?

711
01:28:39,540 --> 01:28:41,510
We all have a destiny

712
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:47,180
and it can't be changed so easily!

713
01:29:24,450 --> 01:29:25,380
OK.

714
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:30,150
Let me reply to this woman.

715
01:30:06,830 --> 01:30:10,130
"1980"

716
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:12,890
This is what I told you about.

717
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:15,720
- Really?
- It's yours.

718
01:30:15,900 --> 01:30:18,030
Thank you so much.

719
01:30:20,100 --> 01:30:24,060
Come to my second house this weekend.

720
01:30:25,580 --> 01:30:27,570
This weekend...

721
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:29,910
- What?
- I have a plan.

722
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:31,140
A boyfriend?

723
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:34,080
I have no boyfriend or a child.

724
01:30:34,650 --> 01:30:36,750
A child...?

725
01:30:37,860 --> 01:30:40,350
How old are you, Harumi?

726
01:30:40,530 --> 01:30:42,260
19, I mean 20.

727
01:30:42,390 --> 01:30:45,490
She looks young. You're 22, right?

728
01:30:45,630 --> 01:30:48,570
- Almost.
- Are you a teenager?

729
01:30:53,170 --> 01:30:55,970
- I'm sorry!
- No problem!

730
01:30:56,170 --> 01:30:57,070
Wipe him down.

731
01:30:57,210 --> 01:30:59,470
A little higher.

732
01:31:06,180 --> 01:31:10,380
Poor Harumi! You came on your day off...

733
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:12,650
It's nothing.

734
01:31:13,690 --> 01:31:17,220
Your fridge is empty. Can I get you anything?

735
01:31:17,730 --> 01:31:21,460
If you could get some vegetables and...

736
01:31:21,670 --> 01:31:24,470
some canned food please.

737
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:29,110
How about some sashimi?

738
01:31:29,110 --> 01:31:31,980
I got paid so it's on me.

739
01:31:33,180 --> 01:31:37,140
Remember, luxuries are sinful.

740
01:31:41,890 --> 01:31:43,120
Are you OK?

741
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:48,890
I'm fine. Maybe I get too relaxed
when you come.

742
01:31:51,260 --> 01:31:52,960
You'd better rest.

743
01:32:10,380 --> 01:32:11,680
You after Mr. Namiya?

744
01:32:16,090 --> 01:32:19,820
The shop's closed but
he still answers letters.

745
01:32:21,290 --> 01:32:22,280
Right.

746
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:27,360
Do you know how to do it?

747
01:33:46,140 --> 01:33:51,580
You have a fantasy view of the world.

748
01:33:52,050 --> 01:33:55,020
Work earnestly as a clerk.

749
01:33:56,050 --> 01:34:01,430
that's the best way to
repay your foster parents.

750
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:47,060
Dear, Mr. Namiya. Thank you for your reply.

751
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:50,740
Your harsh opinion disappointed me.

752
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:55,410
I don't have a fantasy view of the world.

753
01:34:56,550 --> 01:35:00,810
to be a mistress and start a business

754
01:35:01,190 --> 01:35:03,980
sounds like a fantasy.

755
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:09,020
I'll repay him when my business succeeds.

756
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:13,430
What if it doesn't do well?

757
01:35:14,570 --> 01:35:16,690
I'll succeed by studying hard.

758
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:22,900
What will you study?
Do you have a business strategy?

759
01:35:23,470 --> 01:35:27,740
More importantly, can you trust your client?

760
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:31,540
And why do you need money so badly?

761
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:38,080
I lost my parents early
and grew up in an orphanage.

762
01:35:38,290 --> 01:35:43,160
When I was around ten,
I went to live with dad's uncle and aunt.

763
01:35:43,390 --> 01:35:45,990
They helped me through high school.

764
01:35:46,230 --> 01:35:47,130
Let me do it!

765
01:35:47,330 --> 01:35:48,960
Can you. Honey?

766
01:35:49,830 --> 01:35:55,470
They're old now and are
struggling financially.

767
01:35:56,770 --> 01:35:59,240
They have a house mortgage.

768
01:36:00,010 --> 01:36:04,810
I'd do anything to repay them
and help pay their debt.

769
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:08,040
that's all I want now.

770
01:36:09,350 --> 01:36:13,150
Lost Puppy's an orphan, too.

771
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:16,090
Maruko Orphanage?

772
01:36:16,430 --> 01:36:18,260
So what if it was?

773
01:36:18,700 --> 01:36:22,260
I mean, everything seems connected...

774
01:36:25,940 --> 01:36:28,600
Lost Puppy's such a good girl.

775
01:36:28,940 --> 01:36:30,970
How do you know that?

776
01:36:31,180 --> 01:36:32,800
From the letters.

777
01:36:34,110 --> 01:36:36,270
What's going to happen to her?

778
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:43,520
I want her to be happy...

779
01:37:07,580 --> 01:37:11,070
If you trust me and follow my advice

780
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:14,210
your wish might come true.

781
01:37:23,700 --> 01:37:28,360
Lost Puppy, you shouldn't become a mistress.

782
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:36,710
- Harumi.
- Yes!

783
01:37:37,180 --> 01:37:41,200
In a few years Japan will
experience an economic boom.

784
01:37:42,010 --> 01:37:45,920
Work hard and prepare for it by studying

785
01:37:46,050 --> 01:37:48,920
economy and finance.

786
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:51,120
I'm sorry!

787
01:37:52,260 --> 01:37:54,730
Save up and buy a small condo

788
01:37:54,730 --> 01:37:57,200
in central Tokyo.

789
01:37:58,430 --> 01:38:00,590
Its price will rise.

790
01:38:01,270 --> 01:38:05,070
Sell it and buy a better condo.
Repeat the process.

791
01:38:05,540 --> 01:38:08,310
Use the profit as capital for stock

792
01:38:08,310 --> 01:38:11,210
and a golf club membership.

793
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:16,110
Your homework will
help you make the right decisions.

794

"Little Puppy Co. Ltd"

795
01:38:28,190 --> 01:38:31,530
"1988"

796
01:38:33,100 --> 01:38:38,040
You deserve a larger office as a company owner.

797
01:38:40,270 --> 01:38:43,670
A good building's on sale in Nishi Azabu.

798
01:38:45,240 --> 01:38:50,510
But you'd better hurry. We'll give you a loan.

799
01:38:52,180 --> 01:38:58,020
Actually I'm thinking
of liquidating some assets.

800
01:38:58,620 --> 01:39:01,250
In this boom? Are you crazy?

801
01:39:03,730 --> 01:39:06,930
The 90's won't be like this.

802
01:39:22,580 --> 01:39:28,350
My life is so good, thanks to you.

803
01:39:29,290 --> 01:39:33,920
I got to keep the house.

804
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:36,930
Don't thank me.

805
01:39:37,630 --> 01:39:40,830
Who else is there to thank?

806
01:39:50,410 --> 01:39:51,670
- Here.
- thank you.

807
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:53,670
Next in the news

808
01:39:54,510 --> 01:39:57,720
Maruko Orphanage in Tokigoe city

809
01:39:57,720 --> 01:39:59,840
burned down

810
01:40:00,090 --> 01:40:03,080
and a musician died in the fire.

811
01:40:03,620 --> 01:40:08,180
One child was trapped inside and

812
01:40:08,390 --> 01:40:14,420
the musician, Katsuro Matsuoka,
attempted to rescue him.

813
01:40:14,970 --> 01:40:19,430
the child escaped safely but not the musician.

814
01:40:19,770 --> 01:40:24,940
He was found unconscious
on the first floor.

815
01:40:25,340 --> 01:40:27,980
He died at the hospital

816
01:40:27,980 --> 01:40:31,470
from carbon monoxide poisoning.

817
01:40:41,230 --> 01:40:43,660
Thank you for the supplies.

818
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:50,490
I'm so sorry for the young man
who died in the fire.

819
01:40:51,340 --> 01:40:54,240
It's good that all the kids survived.

820
01:40:55,110 --> 01:40:56,810
Yes, no kids or employees were hurt

821
01:40:56,810 --> 01:40:59,400
in the inferno.

822
01:41:00,150 --> 01:41:03,340
Maybe my sister's protecting us.

823
01:41:03,820 --> 01:41:05,310
Your sister?

824
01:41:06,580 --> 01:41:11,320
the founder of the orphanage.
Akiko Minazuki.

825
01:41:11,660 --> 01:41:12,920
Take care of this.

826
01:41:15,830 --> 01:41:21,560
She had a heart problem and died very young.

827
01:41:21,730 --> 01:41:23,670
I didn't know...

828
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,900
Right before she passed away

829
01:41:27,170 --> 01:41:32,740
she said she'd watch
over everyone from above.

830
01:41:34,310 --> 01:41:36,250
What was she like?

831
01:41:36,750 --> 01:41:40,240
A very active, free-spirited woman.

832
01:41:41,420 --> 01:41:46,410
She was a high school student
when she ran off with our servant!

833
01:41:47,390 --> 01:41:51,830
Ran off! It sounds very romantic.

834
01:41:52,060 --> 01:41:55,120
The servant felt unworthy

835
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:58,060
and ended the relationship.

836
01:41:59,140 --> 01:42:01,300
That's how it was back then...

837
01:42:03,010 --> 01:42:07,410
Now what else is there to do?

838
01:42:10,010 --> 01:42:11,140
Sir.

839
01:42:13,380 --> 01:42:15,380
If you don't mind

840
01:42:16,250 --> 01:42:20,160
I'd like to help your orphanage in some way.

841
01:42:21,230 --> 01:42:22,390
Thank you.

843
01:42:36,040 --> 01:42:37,060
Atsuya!

844
01:42:37,380 --> 01:42:38,740
What's up?

845
01:42:40,610 --> 01:42:41,910
I missed you.

846
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:51,860
- We're playing cards.
- Cool!

847
01:43:11,410 --> 01:43:14,540
Are you going to be a doctor, Atsuya?

848
01:43:14,780 --> 01:43:15,710
Why?

849
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:19,480
Because you're smart enough

850
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:20,390
to be one.

851
01:43:20,390 --> 01:43:24,690
"I want to be a surgeon"

852
01:43:27,790 --> 01:43:30,820
It takes more than being smart.

853
01:43:31,130 --> 01:43:32,290
Why?

854
01:43:32,530 --> 01:43:33,960
Because.

855
01:43:35,300 --> 01:43:37,000
Life's hard.

856
01:43:38,170 --> 01:43:39,360
A love hotel?

857
01:43:39,870 --> 01:43:42,030
Be quiet!

858
01:43:47,150 --> 01:43:49,380
Who's that woman anyway?

859
01:43:51,350 --> 01:43:57,690
Her company is in Tokyo
but her parents' house is here.

860
01:43:58,220 --> 01:44:00,450
So she knew this place?

861
01:44:00,830 --> 01:44:03,860
Yes. She's going to build a love hotel

862
01:44:03,860 --> 01:44:05,960
and pachinko parlor here.

863
01:44:06,260 --> 01:44:07,860
Are you sure?

864
01:44:10,700 --> 01:44:13,760
I overheard the staff talking about it.

865
01:44:17,110 --> 01:44:20,110
I'll go...

866
01:44:20,110 --> 01:44:20,980
and ask Kariya.

867
01:44:23,850 --> 01:44:28,790
The witch plans to demolish
the orphanage and get rich.

868
01:44:29,620 --> 01:44:34,290
But then what will happen to the kids?

869
01:44:34,490 --> 01:44:36,530
They'll be separated...

870
01:44:36,530 --> 01:44:38,460
and go to other orphanages.

871
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,930
There's nothing we can do to stop it.

872
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:51,940
Shota, did you say she has a house here?

873
01:44:52,140 --> 01:44:55,270
Yeah. She sometimes comes back on weekends.

874
01:44:55,750 --> 01:44:59,080
I bet she has a luxurious condo in Tokyo.

875
01:45:00,120 --> 01:45:01,590
Let's punish her.

876
01:45:02,090 --> 01:45:04,150
I won't beat up a woman.

877
01:45:04,290 --> 01:45:06,060
No, we'll just mess up her house...

878
01:45:06,060 --> 01:45:08,250
while she's away.

879
01:45:24,140 --> 01:45:26,110
Another padded invoice.

880
01:45:27,180 --> 01:45:31,180
So Mr. Kariya keeps the profits

881
01:45:31,180 --> 01:45:33,480
from inflated subsidies.

882
01:45:33,690 --> 01:45:37,590
Yes. Maruko Orphanage is
close to bankruptcy.

883
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:43,750
Mr. Minazuki would be devastated
if he was alive...

884
01:45:45,300 --> 01:45:46,660
Thank you.

I asked you for advice. I'm Lost Puppy.

Hello.

905
01:48:13,710 --> 01:48:17,550

907
01:48:19,550 --> 01:48:24,720
I'm grateful for your support
which began before I was manager...

908
01:48:25,060 --> 01:48:29,720
But I'm in charge of running the orphanage...

909
01:48:32,160 --> 01:48:32,990
Mr. Kariya.

910
01:48:33,160 --> 01:48:34,060
Yes?

911
01:48:34,630 --> 01:48:37,360
In regard to the operations

912
01:48:37,700 --> 01:48:42,500
I've had my people go over the accounts.

913

Be quiet and we won't harm you.

914

Hey, don't talk!

917
01:50:07,080 --> 01:50:11,640
Wait! Who's turning the orphanage
into a love hotel?

918
01:50:12,750 --> 01:50:15,280
Who are you?

919
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:17,150
Why would I do such a terrible thing?

920
01:50:17,320 --> 01:50:19,690
Shut up! Hold this.

921
01:50:26,730 --> 01:50:27,630
Let's go.

922
01:50:44,980 --> 01:50:48,280
What do you think happened to Lost Puppy?

923
01:50:49,420 --> 01:50:52,020
She'd be fine...

924
01:50:52,020 --> 01:50:53,550
if she followed our advice.

925
01:50:54,860 --> 01:50:58,760
Who'd believe a bogus prophecy?

926
01:50:58,760 --> 01:51:00,420
I bet she threw it out.

927
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:08,990
Look at this!

928
01:51:14,410 --> 01:51:18,470
"Mr. Namiya's back 32 years after his death."

929
01:51:18,980 --> 01:51:24,210
So he died 32 years ago today!

930
01:51:25,620 --> 01:51:29,920
That explains this strange phenomenon!

931
01:51:44,370 --> 01:51:47,270
- Let's experiment.
- It's blank...

932
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:48,770
It'll be OK.

933
01:51:49,940 --> 01:51:51,340
Watch the mail slot.

934
01:52:03,090 --> 01:52:04,290
I'll post it.

935
01:52:10,830 --> 01:52:16,070
Looks like another letter was posted.

936
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:20,170
Let's see.

937
01:52:50,510 --> 01:52:54,570
Maybe I should write my last advice.

938
01:52:55,880 --> 01:52:56,810
Yes.

939
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:05,380
- Well?
- Nothing came through.

940
01:53:05,590 --> 01:53:07,850
I can vouch for that.

941
01:53:09,260 --> 01:53:10,560
I knew it.

942
01:53:12,260 --> 01:53:14,860
The letter I posted...

943
01:53:14,860 --> 01:53:16,860
will be delivered 32 years in the past.

944
01:53:18,200 --> 01:53:23,870
But what happens when it's dawn in our time?

945
01:53:27,940 --> 01:53:31,900
I guess old man Namiya dies.

946
01:53:38,420 --> 01:53:41,880
How did you find this place, Shota?

947
01:53:42,820 --> 01:53:46,280
I followed that woman to find her house.

948
01:53:47,130 --> 01:53:51,070
She dropped by here on her way back to Tokyo.

949
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:51,960
What for?

950
01:53:52,170 --> 01:53:56,700
How would I know? She looked at the shop sign.

951
01:53:58,370 --> 01:54:00,100
So I made a note of it.

952
01:54:00,240 --> 01:54:02,230
Are you stupid?

953
01:54:02,410 --> 01:54:05,710
No one lives here so I thought it was ideal...

954
01:54:08,520 --> 01:54:10,780
What's the woman's name?

955
01:54:10,990 --> 01:54:14,950
Haruko Tamura...?

956
01:54:15,160 --> 01:54:16,620
Tamura...

957
01:54:29,300 --> 01:54:30,860
Harumi Tamura.

958
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:37,710
"To Mr. Namiya"

959
01:54:44,350 --> 01:54:49,190
32 years ago in the winter of 1980

960
01:54:49,390 --> 01:54:54,190
I asked for your advice. I'm Lost Puppy.

961
01:54:55,100 --> 01:54:58,620
I followed your advice

962
01:54:58,770 --> 01:55:02,260
and went on to have a successful life.

963
01:55:04,240 --> 01:55:08,940
I don't know how to
thank you for your wisdom.

964
01:55:10,410 --> 01:55:15,040
Now it's my turn to help others.

965
01:55:15,420 --> 01:55:19,620
That's the only way I know
to repay your favor.

966
01:55:34,140 --> 01:55:35,600
How come...?

967
01:55:37,310 --> 01:55:38,770
What's going on?

968
01:55:41,110 --> 01:55:44,510
What the hell is going on?

969
01:55:51,250 --> 01:55:52,850
There's something...

970
01:55:55,290 --> 01:55:56,690
What is it?

971
01:55:56,960 --> 01:55:59,790
This shop must be connected to

972
01:55:59,790 --> 01:56:01,060
Maruko Orphanage!

973
01:56:01,300 --> 01:56:04,830
It's like someone above is controlling us.

974
01:56:04,830 --> 01:56:06,600
Right down to our break-in!

975
01:56:07,140 --> 01:56:08,660
Shut up!

976
01:56:10,370 --> 01:56:15,110
Calm down.
Are you thinking of turning yourself in?

977
01:56:15,740 --> 01:56:17,840
You want to go to jail?

978
01:56:20,550 --> 01:56:21,850
I'll go...

979
01:56:23,720 --> 01:56:25,020
to her house.

980
01:56:25,550 --> 01:56:27,420
Don't be ridiculous.

981
01:56:37,130 --> 01:56:38,360
Shota...?

982
01:56:42,770 --> 01:56:44,000
Hey!

983
01:56:50,710 --> 01:56:51,910
Atsuya.

984
01:57:00,620 --> 01:57:02,110
Do as you like.

985
01:57:45,930 --> 01:57:48,400
- We have to untie her.
- Right.

986
01:58:28,690 --> 01:58:31,420
Dear Mr. No Name.

987
01:58:32,360 --> 01:58:36,960
Why did you post me a blank letter?

988
01:58:37,470 --> 01:58:40,300
This old man tried to figure it out.

989
01:58:42,810 --> 01:58:45,210
It's just a thought but

990
01:58:45,380 --> 01:58:51,320
maybe it represents the state of your mind.

991
01:58:53,890 --> 01:58:58,620
You can't see where your life's going now.

992
01:58:59,220 --> 01:59:03,720
But please don't despair.

993
01:59:05,360 --> 01:59:08,890
Don't give up hope.

994
01:59:09,700 --> 01:59:14,200
Your future is a blank sheet of paper.

995
01:59:16,310 --> 01:59:20,370
Your future is whatever you write on it.

996
01:59:20,610 --> 01:59:24,310
Everything is up to what you do.

997
01:59:26,950 --> 01:59:33,290
You're free to do anything.
The possibilities are endless.

998
01:59:33,930 --> 01:59:39,060
Hopefully you'll make every day
of your life worthwhile.

999
01:59:39,260 --> 01:59:41,960
Have a fulfilling life.

1000
01:59:44,970 --> 01:59:51,310
I thought my days of giving advice were over.

1001
01:59:52,110 --> 01:59:57,140
This last one was very challenging to answer.

1002
01:59:57,880 --> 01:59:59,870
I appreciate it.

1003
02:00:00,720 --> 02:00:05,050
Thank you so much.

1004
02:00:09,260 --> 02:00:12,230
Best regards, Namiya General Store.

1005
02:01:23,170 --> 02:01:28,070
Dear Mr. Namiya. Thank you for your kind reply.

1006
02:01:28,470 --> 02:01:30,210
I don't think my advice...

1007
02:01:30,210 --> 02:01:33,940
could change someone's life.

1008
02:01:35,350 --> 02:01:37,940
Then why did I write to her?

1009
02:01:39,150 --> 02:01:41,950
I just wanted her to be happy.

1010
02:01:42,520 --> 02:01:46,510
Perhaps her trust in me made her happy.

1011
02:01:47,760 --> 02:01:51,790
I want to meet her and tell her the truth.

1012
02:01:52,760 --> 02:01:55,770
It was her who made choices

1013
02:01:55,770 --> 02:01:59,470
that changed her life.

1014
02:02:01,940 --> 02:02:08,180
I can't comprehend the timeless encounters
we had last night.

1015
02:02:09,350 --> 02:02:13,680
But you taught me to believe
and I appreciate that.

1016
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:18,520
I'm afraid you won't receive this letter.

1017
02:02:19,220 --> 02:02:24,250
But I think that you'll be
watching over us from somewhere.

1018
02:02:25,500 --> 02:02:27,360
Sincerely, No Name.

1019
02:02:45,620 --> 02:02:47,610
Who'd do this to you?

1020
02:02:49,090 --> 02:02:50,820
I have no idea.

1021
02:02:51,320 --> 02:02:53,590
We'll put more officers

1022
02:02:53,590 --> 02:02:55,990
on patrol.

1023
02:02:56,160 --> 02:02:57,090
OK.

1024
02:02:59,160 --> 02:03:00,830
