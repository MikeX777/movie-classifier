Subtitles by Seglora

3
00:01:32,186 --> 00:01:33,708
Say can I get my shoe shined?

4
00:01:34,806 --> 00:01:35,901
Not today,Mr

5
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:37,307
Where is the shine boy?

6
00:01:38,854 --> 00:01:39,950
Where are they all at?

7
00:01:40,062 --> 00:01:42,650
Seems to me I ain't seen one darkie
 on the road since yesterday

8
00:01:42,753 --> 00:01:43,807
Ain't you heard?

9
00:01:44,143 --> 00:01:45,334
No,heard what?

10
00:01:45,334 --> 00:01:47,509
One of the Gowrie boys been shot dead

11
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:49,515
Gowrie? Shoot at Gowrie?

12
00:01:49,515 --> 00:01:52,265
Now who would do a fool thing like that

13
00:01:53,228 --> 00:01:54,807
Shot in the back by a nigger

14
00:02:29,427 --> 00:02:30,562
It's him,it's the sheriff

15
00:02:30,562 --> 00:02:31,589
Bring him in

16
00:02:33,163 --> 00:02:34,804
I'd never thought he'd do it

17
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:51,550
He is here,the sheriff is starting,come on

18
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:32,275
Come on

19
00:03:42,175 --> 00:03:43,506
Knock it off again,sheriff

20
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:44,670
Knock his head next time

21
00:03:44,753 --> 00:03:46,916
Don't bother the sheriff,
the guards will do it for him

22
00:03:46,962 --> 00:03:49,209
You boys get on out of here,
get on back to barber shop

23
00:03:49,265 --> 00:03:51,648
You got a flat tyre,sheriff,
somebody tried to slow you up?

24
00:03:52,086 --> 00:03:54,214
Maybe,somebody don't know me,anyhow

25
00:03:54,608 --> 00:03:56,098
All right,Lucas,come on

26
00:04:39,786 --> 00:04:41,588
You, young man!

27
00:04:42,954 --> 00:04:44,285
Tell your uncle I want to see him

28
00:04:44,568 --> 00:04:45,605
Want to see who?

29
00:04:45,888 --> 00:04:47,857
Lawyer Stevens,John Stevens

30
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,290
He wants to see a lawyer

31
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,181
-Lawyer?
-He ain't even needing an undertaker

32
00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:57,094
I told you boys once to get on out
of here,I ain't going to tell you again.

33
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:36,964
What, Chick,you are perspiring,
you are wet through

34
00:05:36,964 --> 00:05:38,062
Where have you been?

35
00:05:38,121 --> 00:05:40,939
In the Sunday School,the pictures show
 doesn't start until six o'clock

36
00:05:41,034 --> 00:05:42,510
Perhaps there are other attractions

37
00:05:42,784 --> 00:05:43,829
Gosh,I'm hungry!

38
00:05:43,896 --> 00:05:45,214
Is that a proper way to behave?

39
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:47,710
-Sir?
-Coming in here,without a word of greeting

40
00:05:48,044 --> 00:05:49,623
-No,Sir
-This is your home

41
00:05:49,668 --> 00:05:50,751
Yes,Sir

42
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,400
-Well?
-Hello,ma

43
00:05:54,305 --> 00:05:55,393
Hello,father

44
00:05:56,257 --> 00:05:57,257
Hello,Uncle

45
00:05:59,328 --> 00:06:00,409
Paralee

46
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:04,956
-Yes,Sir?
-Bring the chicken in again

47
00:06:04,991 --> 00:06:06,409
I don't know if there is any left

48
00:06:06,626 --> 00:06:07,845
Apparently she's upset today

49
00:06:07,861 --> 00:06:10,696
I don't see why,she is not
 the lady of that murderer

50
00:06:11,072 --> 00:06:13,272
-Or is she?
-No,neither is Chick

51
00:06:14,745 --> 00:06:16,651
Now Chick suppose you explain
 where you've been

52
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,285
Nowhere in particular

53
00:06:18,285 --> 00:06:20,281
Nowhere in particular is 
a mighty large place

54
00:06:20,281 --> 00:06:21,818
I reckon you can do better than that

55
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:24,634
-May I please have the salt?
-More coffee,Paralee

56
00:06:25,683 --> 00:06:27,533
You waited outside 
the jail with the riff-raff

57
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:29,576
from the pool hall and
 the barber shop,didn't you?

58
00:06:30,376 --> 00:06:32,280
Well,did you see what 
you'd expected to see?

59
00:06:33,122 --> 00:06:34,148
They didn't do anything

60
00:06:34,931 --> 00:06:36,292
They just stood there that's all

61
00:06:36,762 --> 00:06:38,991
I want you to stay home
 until this thing is cleaned up

62
00:06:38,991 --> 00:06:40,667
Over,finished and done with

63
00:06:40,713 --> 00:06:42,755
It's happened before and 
it's bound to happen again

64
00:06:42,887 --> 00:06:44,323
Nothing for us to get excited about

65
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,762
I have to run up to Memphis
 for a couple of days

66
00:06:46,762 --> 00:06:47,995
and this is been the way it is

67
00:06:47,995 --> 00:06:50,359
I don't want to have to worry about
 you too,you understand!

68
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,197
That apply to Aleck too

69
00:06:52,296 --> 00:06:54,646
-Yes,Sir
-I told him but he don't listen to me

70
00:06:54,646 --> 00:06:57,947
He listen to Chick,I ain't no
 friend of his,I'm just his Ma

71
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,057
Everybody is going to 
stay right here at home

72
00:07:00,704 --> 00:07:03,741
All this fuss and nonsense simply because

73
00:07:04,406 --> 00:07:07,373
Your friend Lucas Beauchamp really
 seems to have done it this time

74
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,024
Yes

75
00:07:09,024 --> 00:07:11,891
They're going to make a nigger 
out of him once in his life any way

76
00:07:12,551 --> 00:07:13,560
What,Chick!

77
00:07:23,926 --> 00:07:25,011
Let me talk to him

78
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:28,181
-What in heavens name
-Why?He hasn't finished his dinner

79
00:07:28,263 --> 00:07:30,190
It's terrifying,I know it 
but we got to face him

80
00:07:30,472 --> 00:07:33,815
He just doesn't like his napkin up here,
makes him feel not quite grown up

81
00:07:34,126 --> 00:07:35,863
-But he isn't
-He'd better not be

82
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,317
Let me go up and talk to him

83
00:07:37,417 --> 00:07:39,767
Tell him I said to him to come
 down and finish his dinner

84
00:07:39,767 --> 00:07:40,916
whether he is hungry or not

85
00:07:40,997 --> 00:07:43,914
Paralee,or Craig tell Aleck to
 put my suitcase in the car

86
00:08:43,797 --> 00:08:44,816
Tell me what happened?

87
00:08:45,034 --> 00:08:46,667
Why did he have to do a thing like that?

88
00:08:47,224 --> 00:08:48,247
Who knows?

89
00:08:49,434 --> 00:08:50,522
We'll never really know

90
00:08:51,143 --> 00:08:52,302
Your friend Lucas Beauchamp

91
00:08:52,303 --> 00:08:53,346
He is not my friend!

92
00:08:54,105 --> 00:08:56,590
Chick,you mustn't take this so seriously

93
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,694
I'm not

94
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,679
I can't help it

95
00:09:03,262 --> 00:09:04,482
But why,tell me why

96
00:09:04,528 --> 00:09:05,908
I don't know

97
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:08,891
You must tell me,Chick

98
00:09:10,128 --> 00:09:11,313
I don't know if I can

99
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,767
Try,you're old enough to try.

100
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:20,427
And maybe I'm old enough to understand.

101
00:09:26,689 --> 00:09:27,995
It was quite a while ago

102
00:09:28,397 --> 00:09:30,016
Went hunting with Alexander

103
00:09:30,409 --> 00:09:31,503
On the old Edmond's place?

104
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:33,271
Yes?

105
00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:37,969
It was  November,pretty cold.

106
00:09:39,033 --> 00:09:40,395
We were hunting rabbit.

107
00:09:40,749 --> 00:09:42,190
We hadn't jumped one all morning

108
00:10:11,848 --> 00:10:12,876
Alexander!

109
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:25,824
My gun!

110
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:55,300
Get the pole out of his way
 so he can get out

111
00:11:21,909 --> 00:11:24,095
That was just about the first
 time I saw Lucas speech

112
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,713
Come on to my house

113
00:11:32,045 --> 00:11:33,356
Take his gun.

114
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:36,973
Then I realized we were
 hunting on his land

115
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,103
I remember you'd told me the story

116
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:40,716
His grandfather was a slave

117
00:11:41,263 --> 00:11:42,402
He got this land as a gift

118
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:43,942
You told me why

119
00:11:44,897 --> 00:11:47,701
Because his grandfather was the
 first cousin to the man that owned him

120
00:11:48,816 --> 00:11:52,170
So grandfather,to father to son
 came to Lucas Beauchamp

121
00:11:53,158 --> 00:11:56,610
It was 10 acres,all his own,smack in
 the middle of whole plantation

122
00:11:58,147 --> 00:11:59,514
It was Lucas Beauchamp's land

123
00:11:59,862 --> 00:12:02,329
And Lucas Beauchamp proved it,
every step he took

124
00:12:02,882 --> 00:12:04,633
His land and his house

125
00:12:16,632 --> 00:12:17,732
Strip off

126
00:12:21,948 --> 00:12:22,996
Strip off

127
00:12:53,453 --> 00:12:55,779
There was something else,
just what I'd expected

128
00:12:57,145 --> 00:12:58,478
Side meat and greens

129
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,487
He made me the dinner 
that was cooked for him

130
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:06,651
What's that for?

131
00:14:29,678 --> 00:14:30,737
Pick it up!

132
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:38,912
Pick up his money

133
00:14:48,443 --> 00:14:49,819
Give it to him

134
00:14:57,665 --> 00:15:00,333
I was so angry.I was so awfully ashamed

135
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,618
He knew what I did not know

136
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:05,410
What I didn't have sense
 enough to understand

137
00:15:06,497 --> 00:15:08,489
He knew all the time,and I didn't

138
00:15:08,489 --> 00:15:11,471
That I was his guest in his home

139
00:15:18,905 --> 00:15:20,299
Now go on and shoot your rabbit

140
00:15:21,604 --> 00:15:23,248
And stay out of that creek

141
00:15:32,728 --> 00:15:34,311
Then I could hardly wait for Christmas

142
00:15:35,038 --> 00:15:37,803
I went down-town and bought Lucas 
Beauchamp four of their best cigars

143
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:41,143
 a package of snuff for his wife,Molly

144
00:15:41,143 --> 00:15:43,200
That was to pay him his 
seventy cent with interest

145
00:15:43,724 --> 00:15:45,641
The next day he made me take it back again

146
00:15:46,191 --> 00:15:49,765
That's a home-made molasses,
a gift from him to me

147
00:15:53,801 --> 00:15:57,386
That was worse this time,because
 he had a white boy bring it to me

148
00:16:02,713 --> 00:16:05,053
This time it had to be finished,
once and for all

149
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:13,447
Out of what you paid me I saved a quarter
 a week and finally there was enough

150
00:16:13,447 --> 00:16:14,858
Enough so he couldn't pay me back

151
00:16:15,263 --> 00:16:16,664
Enough so he wouldn't if he could

152
00:16:17,528 --> 00:16:18,559
Mother helped me

153
00:16:19,572 --> 00:16:23,605
We bought a dress good enough to wear
 on Sundays,head and set for his wife Molly

154
00:16:23,822 --> 00:16:25,615
I thought that Lucas would have to come now

155
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:27,764
Take off his hat and say

156
00:16:28,425 --> 00:16:29,716
Thank you,Mr Mallison

157
00:16:30,663 --> 00:16:31,688
But he didn't

158
00:16:39,918 --> 00:16:41,656
I saw him in the town just once after that

159
00:16:42,162 --> 00:16:43,241
He didn't even see me

160
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,576
I wasn't there

161
00:16:45,119 --> 00:16:46,847
He didn't even see I wasn't there

162
00:16:47,657 --> 00:16:49,939
I thought now it's finished,it's all over

163
00:16:51,418 --> 00:16:53,205
Then I heard,you see, his wife was dead

164
00:16:54,227 --> 00:16:55,909
Been dead when I sent her the dress

165
00:16:55,994 --> 00:16:57,064
He was grieved

166
00:16:58,265 --> 00:17:03,670
I reckon you can be sad and prouder
 and even lonely,and sad of black skin too

167
00:17:05,508 --> 00:17:09,330
I went to see him,not to his house,
I wouldn't be caught that way again

168
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,337
I picked neutral ground this time

169
00:17:11,392 --> 00:17:12,478
Fraser's store

170
00:17:13,095 --> 00:17:15,694
He came by there any Saturday afternoon

171
00:17:30,566 --> 00:17:32,404
They were watching him,
two of the Gowrie boys

172
00:17:32,787 --> 00:17:34,164
One of them was  Crawford Gowrie..

173
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:37,729
The other was Vinson the younger brother

174
00:17:59,028 --> 00:18:03,101
You,brummie,big headed,bare headed nigger

175
00:18:07,888 --> 00:18:08,894
Get out of here, Lucas!

176
00:18:10,388 --> 00:18:11,988
Get out of here, your fool!

177
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:13,612
Take it easy,Vinson

178
00:18:13,933 --> 00:18:15,003
Don't be a fool

179
00:18:27,895 --> 00:18:31,041
I didn't go after him,couldn't,
I don't know why

180
00:18:32,122 --> 00:18:34,744
Maybe because Vinson Gowrie 
was white, and I was white

181
00:18:35,229 --> 00:18:36,536
 Lucas Beauchamp was not

182
00:18:37,505 --> 00:18:40,077
Right in these woods on a Saturday
 afternoon a few weeks later

183
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:44,020
He killed Vinson Gowrie,
shot him in the back

184
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,745
And yet he thinks I'm his friend.

185
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:54,829
Well,come on

186
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:56,916
He wants a lawyer.

187
00:18:58,135 --> 00:19:00,661
-Is that all?
-He asked for you

188
00:19:13,212 --> 00:19:14,611
Uncle John,can't you go right now?

189
00:19:17,076 --> 00:19:18,142
What's the hurry?

190
00:19:27,308 --> 00:19:28,366
Chick...

191
00:19:28,396 --> 00:19:29,461
Nothing is going to happen

192
00:19:29,846 --> 00:19:31,495
They never start anything in the day time

193
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:33,818
They'll be ashamed to see 
each other's faces

194
00:19:34,636 --> 00:19:35,754
Suppose they are not?

195
00:19:37,026 --> 00:19:38,261
They'll wait for the Gowries

196
00:19:38,325 --> 00:19:39,980
They won't do a thing without the Gowries

197
00:19:39,981 --> 00:19:41,595
and the Gowries are going to bury Vinson

198
00:19:41,595 --> 00:19:43,816
 before they do anything to 
anybody that isn't a Gowrie

199
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:47,214
Then they'll come and drag him
 out of jail and hang him up

200
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:50,622
No,the Gowries are not much
 good except the fish and fight

201
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,995
And rise enough corn 
to boil up some whiskey

202
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,480
But it's Sunday,even for a Gowrie

203
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,280
and they wait for Sunday's passed,
for midnight at least

204
00:19:59,378 --> 00:20:00,461
Suppose they don't

205
00:20:01,045 --> 00:20:02,992
Then there is  a steel door
 and sheriff Hampton

206
00:20:03,301 --> 00:20:04,371
It's his job

207
00:20:04,853 --> 00:20:05,960
Not yours and not mine

208
00:20:11,869 --> 00:20:13,491
But you are going to see him,aren't you?

209
00:20:13,694 --> 00:20:15,225
There isn't much I can do for him now

210
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:16,409
Uncle John

211
00:20:17,696 --> 00:20:20,058
-All right,I'll go
-I want to go with you

212
00:20:20,495 --> 00:20:22,016
All right,after supper

213
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,372
-But suppose they come..
-Suppose of them?

214
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:29,342
Lucas should have thought of that 
before he shot a white man in the back

215
00:20:30,384 --> 00:20:32,012
Come on finish your dinner

216
00:20:39,918 --> 00:20:41,002
Good evening,Mr Lillie

217
00:20:41,445 --> 00:20:42,578
Alone aren't you?

218
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:46,269
Those Gowrie folks got George to do 
before they can get into town

219
00:20:46,313 --> 00:20:48,552
Maybe they'll decide to stay
 at home on a Sunday night

220
00:20:48,689 --> 00:20:50,478
By Jove no,they are set for this Sunday

221
00:20:50,662 --> 00:20:53,199
He ought to thought of that
 before taking to kill a white man

222
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:54,598
on Saturday afternoon

223
00:20:54,942 --> 00:20:55,964
I agree

224
00:20:56,553 --> 00:21:00,604
My wife is not feeling well tonight,but 
tell them to holler if they need any help

225
00:21:00,704 --> 00:21:02,774
I expect they know they 
can depend on you,Mr Lillie

226
00:21:03,957 --> 00:21:05,419
You see he has nothing against Lucas

227
00:21:05,439 --> 00:21:07,073
He'll probably tell you like some other

228
00:21:07,074 --> 00:21:09,027
 don't like the white folks,
and he believe it

229
00:21:09,027 --> 00:21:11,391
all he requires is that Lucas
 acts like a negro

230
00:21:11,467 --> 00:21:13,191
Which he believes what must have happened

231
00:21:13,191 --> 00:21:15,028
Lucas blew his top and murdered a white man

232
00:21:15,064 --> 00:21:17,474
Now the white folks are going
 to take him out and burn him

233
00:21:17,474 --> 00:21:18,909
No hard feelings on either side

234
00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:22,331
In fact Mr Lilley will be probably one of
 the first to contribute cash money

235
00:21:22,331 --> 00:21:25,661
to Lucas's funeral and support of his 
widow and children if they had any

236
00:21:32,443 --> 00:21:34,871
- What's that?
- Someone of Mr. Lilley's friends

237
00:21:44,758 --> 00:21:46,199
-Good evening.Mr Legate
-Evening

238
00:21:47,621 --> 00:21:50,566
Mr Stevens,you had to get
 mixed up in it too

239
00:21:51,021 --> 00:21:52,679
Seems like you can't let life act alone

240
00:21:53,064 --> 00:21:54,180
I'm his lawyer,Mr Tubbs

241
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,666
Will here won't even shut 
and lock the front door

242
00:21:57,151 --> 00:21:58,652
I'm doing just what the sheriff said

243
00:21:58,652 --> 00:22:02,650
He is saying me aside and it is a night
 to resist and is just what I going to do

244
00:22:03,308 --> 00:22:06,470
Does the sheriff think that gun and 
funny papers are going to stop the Gowries?

245
00:22:06,861 --> 00:22:10,792
I don't suppose to stopping by myself,
I've got you,and you got a pistol

246
00:22:10,792 --> 00:22:14,820
Me? Me getting in their way for 75$ a month

247
00:22:16,106 --> 00:22:17,726
Better for everybody if them folks

248
00:22:17,726 --> 00:22:20,263
just took him as soon as they
 laid hands on him yesterday

249
00:22:20,728 --> 00:22:22,534
But they didn't and I don't think they will

250
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,501
Don't mind me I'm on duty
 doing as best as I can

251
00:22:25,883 --> 00:22:27,790
I've taken an oath of office too

252
00:22:28,499 --> 00:22:32,369
How am I going to live with myself
 if I let a posse of no good Gowries

253
00:22:32,369 --> 00:22:34,168
to take a prisoner away from me

254
00:22:35,634 --> 00:22:38,238
And don't think nobody
 don't make me admit I like it

255
00:22:38,363 --> 00:22:39,761
I got a wife and two children

256
00:22:40,511 --> 00:22:44,896
What good in my tomb if I get myself
 killed for taking a hard stand

257
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,015
Look

258
00:22:58,863 --> 00:23:02,564
Look at them,they ain't asleep not a one

259
00:23:02,609 --> 00:23:04,523
And I don't blame them 
when a mob of white men

260
00:23:04,723 --> 00:23:08,164
 is going busting here with pistols
 and cans of gasoline

261
00:23:10,018 --> 00:23:13,133
Well,it won't be the first time,
and the law of black cats look alike

262
00:23:17,051 --> 00:23:18,530
-Entitled to a cell?
-Serious orders

263
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:21,080
I don't know what the
 next white man he figures

264
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,262
he can't risk going to kill 
somebody and going to think about it

265
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:29,739
I've taken the blankets off

266
00:23:30,246 --> 00:23:32,768
Maybe because he won't be here
 long enough to have to go asleep

267
00:23:45,575 --> 00:23:47,352
Well,old man you played the devil this time

268
00:24:13,575 --> 00:24:14,626
Then you can take my case?

269
00:24:14,976 --> 00:24:17,398
Take the case? What do you mean?
 Depending before the judge?

270
00:24:17,763 --> 00:24:19,672
I'm going to pay you,
you don't have to worry

271
00:24:20,672 --> 00:24:22,866
I don't defend murderers
 that shoot people in the back

272
00:24:26,038 --> 00:24:28,537
Let's give it a trial,we 
ain't come to it yet

273
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:32,441
Now I want to hire somebody,
don't have to be no lawyer

274
00:24:32,509 --> 00:24:33,535
To do what?

275
00:24:34,316 --> 00:24:36,115
Is you or ain't' you going to take the job?

276
00:24:36,955 --> 00:24:38,959
I'd already taken your 
case before I came in here

277
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:41,964
I am going to tell you what to do as
 soon as you tell me what happened

278
00:24:42,259 --> 00:24:43,292
-Never mind that
-Mind?

279
00:24:43,658 --> 00:24:45,044
What I want is..

280
00:24:45,044 --> 00:24:47,656
You tell the Gowries to never mind 
when they bust in here tonight

281
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,269
So you don't want the job?

282
00:24:49,753 --> 00:24:53,217
No,but I'll do it just the same

283
00:24:53,917 --> 00:24:55,957
Now tell me exactly why 
you killed Vinson Gowrie?

284
00:24:56,395 --> 00:24:59,010
Was it to that kind of trouble at
 Fraser's store two months ago?

285
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,565
I was there Uncle John,
I'll be your witness

286
00:25:01,597 --> 00:25:04,121
That's Lucas's trouble now,he's
 got too many witnesses already

287
00:25:04,947 --> 00:25:06,043
Well?

288
00:25:10,436 --> 00:25:13,444
There was two white folks,
partners in a sawmill

289
00:25:13,444 --> 00:25:17,731
 in this way they were buying
 lumber to the sawmill on credit

290
00:25:17,821 --> 00:25:18,828
Who were they?

291
00:25:20,736 --> 00:25:22,283
Vinson Gowrie was one of them

292
00:25:22,283 --> 00:25:24,465
Lucas has it not occurred 
to you that if you just said

293
00:25:24,465 --> 00:25:26,554
Mr to the white people and
said it like you meant it

294
00:25:26,554 --> 00:25:27,954
you might not been sitting here now

295
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,028
So I am to commence now?

296
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,523
I can start off by saying Mr to folks

297
00:25:31,523 --> 00:25:34,928
that drag me out of here 
and builds a fire under me?

298
00:25:35,124 --> 00:25:36,458
Nothing is going to happen to you

299
00:25:36,471 --> 00:25:39,389
Nobody takes you if you 
got a good pair of hands

300
00:25:39,389 --> 00:25:40,576
Sure of hands,is home in bed

301
00:25:41,329 --> 00:25:46,596
It's a point of Mr Wilbur Legate to sit 
downstairs and throw away the shotgun

302
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:47,925
I ain't querying any Will Legate

303
00:25:47,926 --> 00:25:51,099
The day you hunted? The man that can hit a
 running rabbit with a 30 30 rifle?

304
00:25:52,045 --> 00:25:57,748
Them Gowries ain't no deer,they might be 
carrymouse and panthers,they ain't no deer

305
00:25:58,145 --> 00:26:01,305
All right,I'll stay here with you till 
the morning if it makes you feel better

306
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,135
Now go on

307
00:26:03,518 --> 00:26:06,522
Vinson Gowrie was doing a lumber deal.
Who was the other man?

308
00:26:06,522 --> 00:26:08,577
Vinson Gowrie was the only 
one what's public here

309
00:26:09,407 --> 00:26:12,245
And he got public by being shot
 in the back in broad daylight

310
00:26:12,368 --> 00:26:13,546
Well,that's one way to do it

311
00:26:14,723 --> 00:26:16,370
All right,who's the other partner?

312
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:17,473
What was his name?

313
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,512
Some other man

314
00:26:21,459 --> 00:26:23,508
He was stealing a load of 
my lumber every night so

315
00:26:24,084 --> 00:26:25,085
How do you know?

316
00:26:25,086 --> 00:26:26,989
I've seen him

317
00:26:27,266 --> 00:26:28,292
All right,and then what?

318
00:26:28,779 --> 00:26:30,368
Now you answer me some questions

319
00:26:30,416 --> 00:26:32,148
Is you or ain't you going to take the case?

320
00:26:32,617 --> 00:26:35,293
You haven't got a case,you look
at the suspicious and took a pistol

321
00:26:35,484 --> 00:26:38,653
and went straight in a wrong between
two white men,what did you expect?

322
00:26:38,802 --> 00:26:39,846
What else did you expect?

323
00:26:40,879 --> 00:26:43,806
You don't want justice,you want mercy

324
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,971
Well?

325
00:26:49,576 --> 00:26:50,605
Well,what?

326
00:26:50,975 --> 00:26:52,227
The rest of it,what happened?

327
00:26:55,074 --> 00:26:56,082
That's all

328
00:26:57,071 --> 00:27:00,993
Then I tell you,you went to Fraser's
 store again and met Vinson Gowrie

329
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,209
You told him that someone was robbing
 you,he cursed you and called you a liar

330
00:27:04,742 --> 00:27:07,343
Whether it was true or not,naturally,
he would have to do that

331
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,994
Maybe he even knocked 
you down and walked off

332
00:27:10,206 --> 00:27:11,382
And you shot him in the back

333
00:27:13,241 --> 00:27:14,504
Never nobody knocked me down

334
00:27:14,504 --> 00:27:17,525
So much the worse,
it's not even self defence

335
00:27:19,577 --> 00:27:20,592
Now you listen to me

336
00:27:21,105 --> 00:27:22,888
I'm going to get you
 tried in another county

337
00:27:22,913 --> 00:27:25,400
Persuade the District Attorney
 out there since they don't you

338
00:27:25,499 --> 00:27:27,585
that you are an old man,never
 been in trouble before

339
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,979
You plead guilty and ask
 the mercy of the court

340
00:27:30,112 --> 00:27:33,411
And hope they send you to a penitentiary
 where you will be safe from the Gowries

341
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,385
I'll made this offer once 
and I'll  make it again

342
00:27:35,472 --> 00:27:37,455
Do you want me to stay 
with you in here tonight?

343
00:27:37,529 --> 00:27:42,147
I reckon not,they kept me up all last
 night,I'm going to try to get some sleep

344
00:27:42,147 --> 00:27:45,048
If you stay here you'll talk
to the morning

345
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:47,024
Right

346
00:27:49,062 --> 00:27:50,942
How do expect to get me help from anybody?

347
00:27:50,942 --> 00:27:53,603
I don't want help,I paid my way

348
00:27:53,603 --> 00:27:55,623
You won't pay your way out of this

349
00:28:00,199 --> 00:28:01,212
You broke it

350
00:28:02,782 --> 00:28:04,641
You might bring me a can of tobacco

351
00:28:05,221 --> 00:28:07,184
If them Dowries leave me time to smoking

352
00:28:07,555 --> 00:28:10,601
Tomorrow,we don't want you 
to keep you awake tonight

353
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,006
You aren't going to help him,aren't you?

354
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:35,173
Of course I am,whether 
he wants me to or not

355
00:28:35,703 --> 00:28:37,297
As for change of venue,pleading guilty

356
00:28:37,748 --> 00:28:39,315
Then they tell you what really happened

357
00:28:40,246 --> 00:28:42,477
I know what happened,
he killed Vinson Gowrie

358
00:28:42,477 --> 00:28:45,161
no matter what provocations and
 he probably had plenty

359
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:46,427
Nevertheless he's killed a man

360
00:28:46,526 --> 00:28:49,561
But there was something he
 wanted, started to tell you

361
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:51,823
I know the answer to that too

362
00:28:52,282 --> 00:28:53,453
He was going to tell me a lie

363
00:28:53,553 --> 00:28:56,403
he knew I couldn't believe,and ding his 
lawyer,I had to defend like it

364
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,273
No,I know what's happened and the
 only cure for it,come on,let's go home

365
00:29:00,658 --> 00:29:01,874
I might take him the tobacco

366
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:03,974
That can wait for morning

367
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:07,156
Chick,your father told me before he
 left to see you didn't go anywhere

368
00:29:07,156 --> 00:29:08,476
I know

369
00:29:09,243 --> 00:29:10,717
Then you get home as fast as you can

370
00:29:10,717 --> 00:29:11,785
Yes,Sir

371
00:29:22,364 --> 00:29:23,370
What again?

372
00:29:23,371 --> 00:29:24,414
I forgot something

373
00:29:24,424 --> 00:29:25,601
Let it rest till the morning

374
00:29:26,295 --> 00:29:27,555
Oh,let him get it tonight

375
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:30,279
I am afraid if he leaves to the
 morning he might get trampled on

376
00:29:51,011 --> 00:29:53,954
Let open the gate,I intend to
 give him through the bars

377
00:30:21,867 --> 00:30:23,405
All right,what do you want me to do?

378
00:30:23,915 --> 00:30:26,330
-Go out there
-Go out where?

379
00:30:26,787 --> 00:30:29,092
The Gowries buries into chapel

380
00:30:29,092 --> 00:30:30,107
What?

381
00:30:30,107 --> 00:30:31,994
That's nine miles out of the bridge

382
00:30:31,994 --> 00:30:34,153
Then first right hand turn up the hills

383
00:30:35,185 --> 00:30:37,642
All you got to do is going to look at him

384
00:30:37,642 --> 00:30:41,071
Me? Why should I do such a thing?

385
00:30:44,105 --> 00:30:45,193
Come here

386
00:30:46,867 --> 00:30:49,467
Because my pistol is a 41 colt

387
00:30:50,477 --> 00:30:52,885
All right,suppose it is,then what?

388
00:30:53,356 --> 00:30:55,890
He wasn't shot with no 41 colt

389
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:56,939
What was he shot with?

390
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,346
What kind of shot was he shot with,Lucas?

391
00:31:01,503 --> 00:31:05,903
I'm going to pay you,name your price and
 anything within reason and I'll pay you

392
00:31:05,903 --> 00:31:09,617
But why me,why do you call me,
what can I do about it?

393
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:15,896
Because you ain't clattered,you can listen 
but a man like your uncle he ain't got time

394
00:31:15,966 --> 00:31:17,058
He is too full of notions

395
00:31:19,764 --> 00:31:20,998
Tell me what you want me to do

396
00:31:22,889 --> 00:31:24,916
They bury at the Caledonian Chapel

397
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:28,360
Up in that part of the county,
up in the night?

398
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,694
Even the sheriff won't go up
 there unless he is sent for

399
00:31:30,842 --> 00:31:32,108
And you want me to?

400
00:31:32,404 --> 00:31:35,626
Anyway I have to be back 
at midnight or the Gowries

401
00:31:35,626 --> 00:31:37,388
I know about the Gowries

402
00:31:37,388 --> 00:31:38,634
Even midnight will be too late

403
00:31:40,802 --> 00:31:42,576
I don't see how I can make it

404
00:31:45,014 --> 00:31:46,597
I'll try to wait

405
00:32:07,357 --> 00:32:11,026
Wait! What did he tell you?

406
00:32:11,712 --> 00:32:12,803
Nothing Mr Gowrie

407
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,259
You have been up to see him twice

408
00:32:15,192 --> 00:32:16,271
Why not? Why shouldn't I?

409
00:32:16,271 --> 00:32:17,754
He killed my kid brother

410
00:32:17,841 --> 00:32:20,342
And I'm here to see that nobody
 stick him over the county line

411
00:32:20,342 --> 00:32:21,767
where we can't get at him

412
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,056
You tell me what you went up there for?

413
00:32:25,425 --> 00:32:26,977
He asked me to bring him some tobacco

414
00:32:27,537 --> 00:32:28,623
Tobacco?

415
00:32:29,868 --> 00:32:32,497
We buried Vinson this morning,and 
do you know how he was killed?

416
00:32:36,379 --> 00:32:37,844
Tell me what he told you

417
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,698
He said it wasn't his gun

418
00:32:40,655 --> 00:32:42,664
He is a smart nigger,I'd say the same thing

419
00:32:52,861 --> 00:32:54,168
So he told you it wasn't his gun

420
00:32:56,628 --> 00:32:58,870
If I were Lucas or any 
other ignorant murderer

421
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,682
I'd claim the exactly the same thing myself

422
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:02,265
That's just what Crawford Gowrie said.

423
00:33:02,363 --> 00:33:03,160
Where?

424
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,160
Outside the jail

425
00:33:05,226 --> 00:33:06,588
And the Gowries are there already

426
00:33:07,211 --> 00:33:09,890
And you come to me,and I say 
no more that what a Gowrie says

427
00:33:10,668 --> 00:33:14,860
It's true,in the matters of life and death,
a man's vocabulary is almighty small

428
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,300
-Oh Excuse me,Good Evening,Miss Habersham
-Good Evening

429
00:33:20,684 --> 00:33:22,816
Where as in the matter
 of Miss Habersham's truck

430
00:33:22,816 --> 00:33:25,851
 in dreadful collision to
a worn out rooster

431
00:33:25,851 --> 00:33:31,097
which your neighbour Mr Winston swears and 
contends is of high pedigree stock

432
00:33:31,186 --> 00:33:32,494
Worth at least 7 $

433
00:33:32,924 --> 00:33:34,730
There are all the words in the world

434
00:33:35,956 --> 00:33:38,981
Why if he had to shoot a white man,
did he do it up there in deep mine?

435
00:33:39,314 --> 00:33:42,022
He couldn't picked the worse place
 for himself in this whole county

436
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:43,633
Maybe not in the whole world

437
00:33:43,633 --> 00:33:47,397
But if he had to do it there
 why did he pick the Gowries?

438
00:33:47,497 --> 00:33:50,326
And if he picked the Gowries why did
 he have to shoot him in the back

439
00:33:51,133 --> 00:33:52,213
Maybe he didn't

440
00:33:57,149 --> 00:33:59,862
Maybe we might find out if we
 went up where he was buried

441
00:34:00,236 --> 00:34:02,537
Chick,now tell me,what did
 Lucas asked you to do?

442
00:34:04,199 --> 00:34:05,503
Maybe the sheriff could do it

443
00:34:06,237 --> 00:34:07,309
Do exactly what?

444
00:34:09,982 --> 00:34:11,499
Dig him up

445
00:34:11,959 --> 00:34:14,460
-What?
-To get the bullet out and look at it

446
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,941
Why in heavens name?

447
00:34:15,941 --> 00:34:18,061
To see that it comes from a 41 colt

448
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:23,104
Dig up Vinson Gowrie out of ground he's
 been prayed and consecrated into?

449
00:34:24,378 --> 00:34:27,239
Violate a Gowrie's grave to 
save a black from punishment?

450
00:34:28,256 --> 00:34:29,768
I'd rather tell old man Gowrie

451
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:32,410
I want to exhumes his boy's body
 to get his gold out of its teeth

452
00:34:33,591 --> 00:34:36,632
Even if Lucas' story were true,
even if every word of it were true

453
00:34:36,632 --> 00:34:39,586
even then we couldn't do it,not you,not me

454
00:34:39,586 --> 00:34:43,293
not sheriff Hampton,not the governor,
not the President of the United States

455
00:35:07,368 --> 00:35:08,406
It's Chick

456
00:35:08,698 --> 00:35:10,324
I'll let you not going to do it tonight

457
00:35:10,424 --> 00:35:12,120
I didn't say I was

458
00:35:20,882 --> 00:35:21,975
It's Chick with Ryebow

459
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,379
Let him be

460
00:35:29,285 --> 00:35:30,744
Go ahead,go ahead,if you want to

461
00:35:31,207 --> 00:35:34,568
That Lucas being so smart,why
 did he has to do a thing like that

462
00:35:34,568 --> 00:35:36,943
Go ahead,do you what you just want to do

463
00:35:36,943 --> 00:35:38,158
I ain't going nowhere

464
00:35:38,407 --> 00:35:39,460
At least not very far

465
00:35:46,943 --> 00:35:48,019
Where are you going?

466
00:35:48,388 --> 00:35:50,802
-Far enough
-Where is that?

467
00:35:50,902 --> 00:35:53,744
Where I don't have to see or hear 
anything that have happened tonight

468
00:35:54,077 --> 00:35:56,037
I am going after more
feed if you go that far

469
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:05,624
Chick

470
00:36:11,798 --> 00:36:13,003
What did Lucas tell you?

471
00:36:13,701 --> 00:36:14,961
He said it was not his pistol

472
00:36:14,961 --> 00:36:16,520
I know and then what?

473
00:36:17,986 --> 00:36:20,053
He wants me to pick up the body

474
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:21,116
Well?

475
00:36:21,116 --> 00:36:23,882
I can't even if I could you know 
what Uncle John would say

476
00:36:26,243 --> 00:36:28,378
I got a flash,I got my car

477
00:36:29,064 --> 00:36:32,011
Can you get some tools,a pick and shovel?

478
00:36:34,124 --> 00:36:36,209
Going to no good,
he will be burned just the same

479
00:36:36,209 --> 00:36:39,947
just exactly the same for you 
could not doing anything about it

480
00:36:40,053 --> 00:36:41,143
How far is it?

481
00:36:41,143 --> 00:36:44,259
Caledonian Chapel is on the 
hill beyond the bridge

482
00:36:44,957 --> 00:36:46,908
Then we do need a horse

483
00:36:47,518 --> 00:36:49,580
We? Do you expect to come,Miss Habersham?

484
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:53,832
We'll park at the bottom of the hill,
then we use the horse,he'll make less noise

485
00:36:55,121 --> 00:36:56,251
Can you drive?

486
00:36:56,251 --> 00:36:57,709
I am not supposed to go

487
00:36:57,709 --> 00:37:00,585
I know,neither is Mr Stevens

488
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:05,233
neither is the sheriff,or the governor,
or the President of the United States

489
00:37:05,694 --> 00:37:08,857
For that matter neither am I,
but somebody got to do it

490
00:37:10,123 --> 00:37:11,301
Come on

491
00:38:34,121 --> 00:38:36,178
Don't go across the bridge
 it will make noise

492
00:38:36,698 --> 00:38:37,941
Go and cross the creek

493
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:01,437
What's the matter?

494
00:39:01,843 --> 00:39:03,008
He smells quicksand

495
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,039
A mule coming down the hill.

496
00:40:36,099 --> 00:40:37,138
Who's that on the mule?

497
00:40:37,398 --> 00:40:39,779
-I couldn't even see it was a mule
-I couldn't see anything

498
00:40:40,514 --> 00:40:43,247
Suppose he saw us,suppose
 he knows he can catch us

499
00:40:43,494 --> 00:40:45,030
Maybe he had carrying things

500
00:41:34,097 --> 00:41:35,181
Here it is

501
00:42:00,954 --> 00:42:02,180
There is no need for any pick

502
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:04,229
So much the better

503
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:06,585
Got to excavate,I'll help

504
00:43:30,363 --> 00:43:32,448
All right,Aleck,give me a hand

505
00:43:43,551 --> 00:43:44,852
We need a crowbar

506
00:43:45,192 --> 00:43:46,868
And rope.We forgot the rope

507
00:44:09,489 --> 00:44:10,755
It's empty

508
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:33,151
Well,you would not have come
 here at four o'clock in the morning

509
00:44:33,251 --> 00:44:34,772
with a tale like that if it wasn't so

510
00:44:35,533 --> 00:44:36,829
Looks like he might be innocent

511
00:44:37,723 --> 00:44:40,147
He could have killed Vinson Gowrie 
but he never dug him up

512
00:44:40,851 --> 00:44:43,019
Because Vinson wasn't buried
 until Sunday afternoon.

513
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:47,515
By that time Lucas had been locked
 up in that cell for almost six hours

514
00:44:48,029 --> 00:44:50,901
-Sheriff if we don't..
-Vinson isn't in that grave

515
00:44:50,901 --> 00:44:53,072
But officially he is

516
00:44:53,543 --> 00:44:55,278
By the county records he is

517
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:58,157
So you want me to dig
 him up again officially

518
00:44:59,725 --> 00:45:01,854
Gowrie grave,Gowrie ground

519
00:45:02,592 --> 00:45:04,289
Who is going to get old Hubb's permission?

520
00:45:04,598 --> 00:45:05,666
Aren't you the sheriff?

521
00:45:05,718 --> 00:45:06,749
But you're the lawyer

522
00:45:07,069 --> 00:45:08,145
You're the talker

523
00:45:08,311 --> 00:45:09,348
And tell him what?

524
00:45:09,431 --> 00:45:11,519
That we are trying to save
 the black skin of a man

525
00:45:11,619 --> 00:45:13,561
who was found with a 
fired pistol in his pocket?

526
00:45:13,625 --> 00:45:14,746
Standing over a dead Gowrie?

527
00:45:14,846 --> 00:45:16,576
It will take more than a lawyer to do that

528
00:45:16,616 --> 00:45:18,833
If we are going up to that
 graveyard without permission

529
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:20,614
We'll wait till it's broad daylight

530
00:45:21,692 --> 00:45:26,076
We didn't and what is going to happen
 to Lucas Beauchamp in the mean time

531
00:45:26,076 --> 00:45:27,656
That's an iron door,Miss Eunice

532
00:45:27,656 --> 00:45:29,020
There is a key to it

533
00:45:29,249 --> 00:45:30,733
Meaning Mr Tubbs is only a man

534
00:45:30,829 --> 00:45:33,337
Will Legate had 12 gates
 and a shotgun inside,Mam

535
00:45:33,415 --> 00:45:36,891
If enough Gowries are that keen,
enough work and they are keen

536
00:45:36,914 --> 00:45:38,711
You mean if they are enough to get together

537
00:45:38,711 --> 00:45:39,988
they make up a collected minds

538
00:45:40,088 --> 00:45:42,579
they'll pass even Will Legate and his
 12 gates and the shotgun

539
00:45:42,625 --> 00:45:43,633
We will back before then

540
00:45:43,683 --> 00:45:44,767
And if you are not?

541
00:45:44,789 --> 00:45:47,237
He is doing the best his 
judgement tells him to,Miss Eunice

542
00:45:47,337 --> 00:45:48,476
You can't ask more than that

543
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,778
If you mean these two children and 
me we are not asking anything

544
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:55,941
It's Lucas you got to trap for or cow to

545
00:45:55,941 --> 00:45:59,438
No,Miss Eunice,it's none of us up to
do anything before we had some breakfast

546
00:46:00,229 --> 00:46:02,712
Drink your coffee,that's a full 
swelling of Mr Hampton's style

547
00:46:06,167 --> 00:46:08,096
What I like to know how
 the same Lucas Beauchamp

548
00:46:08,096 --> 00:46:10,708
 could convince me he was guilty and
 convince you he was innocent

549
00:46:11,653 --> 00:46:12,726
And you too

550
00:46:13,368 --> 00:46:15,595
What I would like to know 
what Chick and his buddy

551
00:46:15,595 --> 00:46:18,164
would have done if there had
 been a body in that coffin

552
00:46:19,233 --> 00:46:20,889
I don't know,I hadn't thought about it

553
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:22,691
I did

554
00:46:27,124 --> 00:46:29,502
Put some sugar in it child

555
00:46:31,223 --> 00:46:34,684
You? You were out there too helping
 digging up a white man's grave.Why?

556
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:36,861
Was it because Miss Habersham made you?

557
00:46:38,115 --> 00:46:42,594
Never made me,I didn't even know that I
was going,to tell you suddenly,there I was

558
00:46:45,126 --> 00:46:46,299
Why didn't I believe Lucas?

559
00:46:47,398 --> 00:46:49,244
Why didn't he trust me a loyal to the truth

560
00:46:50,152 --> 00:46:53,835
You are a white man,worse than that,
you are a grown white man

561
00:46:54,074 --> 00:46:55,648
Yes,I've heard that before too

562
00:46:55,648 --> 00:46:59,045
I heard Aleck's grandfather tell 
Chick and Aleck that once

563
00:46:59,763 --> 00:47:02,463
Do you want to get anything done,
don't bother the men folks with it

564
00:47:02,799 --> 00:47:04,329
They are too clattered up with facts

565
00:47:04,394 --> 00:47:06,204
Get the women and 
children to working on it

566
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:07,628
Is that what you meant?

567
00:47:09,447 --> 00:47:11,991
Why don't you drink your coffee
 yourself so we can get started

568
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:15,667
It's more than that

569
00:47:15,668 --> 00:47:19,875
there is a wall going up between us.
Lucas can't see through it and I won't

570
00:47:21,745 --> 00:47:22,964
Maybe that's wrong

571
00:47:24,113 --> 00:47:27,213
We're the ones who can't see through it
 because we are the ones who are blind

572
00:47:39,399 --> 00:47:40,907
Will Legate!What are you doing here ?

573
00:47:41,413 --> 00:47:42,929
Morning,Miss Habersham

574
00:47:47,936 --> 00:47:51,804
It is broad daylight,I got 2 miles to
 walk before I can feed them

575
00:47:51,915 --> 00:47:53,046
-You see?
-Who is on guard?

576
00:47:54,157 --> 00:47:55,855
I'll wake Tubbs and give him a shot gun

577
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,178
Oh,it is all quiet over there,
I wouldn't left if it hadn't been

578
00:47:59,362 --> 00:48:00,395
Are you too sure..

579
00:48:00,423 --> 00:48:02,467
Miss Eunice let's finish breakfast 
and get started

580
00:48:02,567 --> 00:48:04,503
Mr Hampton is right,Miss Eunice,
and so are you

581
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:07,590
They'll pass even Will Legate sooner or
 later when there was enough of them

582
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:09,471
But there is one thing that would stop them

583
00:48:09,549 --> 00:48:10,549
Long enough,anyhow

584
00:48:11,939 --> 00:48:13,853
And that is somebody without a gun

585
00:48:19,114 --> 00:48:20,117
A lady

586
00:48:20,863 --> 00:48:21,878
A white lady

587
00:48:27,604 --> 00:48:32,028
All right but I am not going to sit
 there all the morning doing nothing

588
00:48:32,028 --> 00:48:34,518
so the gaoler's wife will think 
she has to talk to me

589
00:48:35,536 --> 00:48:38,583
I'll go home and get some mending
 to do and feed the chickens

590
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:40,176
Maybe Aleck will drive me

591
00:48:40,176 --> 00:48:41,629
I don't know Mum want me..

592
00:48:41,629 --> 00:48:44,520
You gone this far you can go a
 little further,you and me,both

593
00:48:46,816 --> 00:48:47,902
I reckon so

594
00:48:48,896 --> 00:48:50,377
Yes and..

595
00:48:54,457 --> 00:48:56,317
Who can eat more than two eggs?

596
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:23,072
Well,we won't have the county 
the sense to stay home anyway

597
00:49:23,734 --> 00:49:24,790
They'd rather have

598
00:49:25,494 --> 00:49:27,151
We are too late,they
 are going to get him

599
00:49:27,284 --> 00:49:30,427
No,not these people, I haven't seen 
any of the Gowrie,not yet anywhere

600
00:49:31,141 --> 00:49:32,336
-Suppose ..
-I reckon that

601
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:33,497
They are just going to town

602
00:49:33,497 --> 00:49:36,509
to see something happening and wait
 for the Gowries,just to wait,that's all

603
00:49:36,509 --> 00:49:37,076
But suppose

604
00:49:37,076 --> 00:49:39,064
Suppose we'd stop supposing
 and denying either

605
00:49:39,064 --> 00:49:40,847
 to get out there and do what we have to do

606
00:50:12,543 --> 00:50:16,889
All right,boys,jump to it,let's get
 to work done and get out of here

607
00:50:44,106 --> 00:50:45,501
What is going round here,sheriff?

608
00:50:46,128 --> 00:50:48,224
I am going to open this grave,Mr Gowrie

609
00:50:48,817 --> 00:50:50,347
No sheriff,not that grave

610
00:50:51,216 --> 00:50:53,781
Yes,Mr Gowrie I am going to open it

611
00:51:15,774 --> 00:51:16,787
Get back to the car boys

612
00:51:18,672 --> 00:51:19,700
Never mind boys

613
00:51:20,116 --> 00:51:22,457
I ain't going to hurt you,I'm 
talking to the sheriff here

614
00:51:24,339 --> 00:51:25,837
The boy ain't in that grave

615
00:51:26,892 --> 00:51:30,010
Don't tell me the name of the fellow 
that proved my boy ain't there,sheriff

616
00:51:47,199 --> 00:51:48,304
It's empty

617
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,336
I saw it last night

618
00:52:08,698 --> 00:52:11,479
Grab those shovels,sons,
they belong to the county

619
00:52:11,818 --> 00:52:14,183
If we bust one,it's nobody's 
business except the grand jury

620
00:52:37,403 --> 00:52:38,714
What have they done with my boy

621
00:52:40,447 --> 00:52:43,606
Mr Gowrie I think you knew last night
 that something was wrong

622
00:52:44,823 --> 00:52:47,170
You knew that Lucas would be
 dead some time after midnight

623
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:48,967
 or as soon as you could have got into town

624
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:50,703
But you stayed home,why?

625
00:52:52,936 --> 00:52:54,069
Why,Mr Gowrie?

626
00:52:55,517 --> 00:52:59,095
Uncle Charles I found some tracks come on

627
00:53:25,147 --> 00:53:26,709
Here,I found them again

628
00:53:39,871 --> 00:53:42,974
Here,here was the animal was hiding

629
00:53:44,952 --> 00:53:46,150
And there was it stopped

630
00:53:46,297 --> 00:53:47,362
Alec said it was a mule

631
00:53:47,722 --> 00:53:48,895
Aleck whom? Oh

632
00:53:49,375 --> 00:53:50,726
Sure,the other detectives

633
00:53:50,775 --> 00:53:53,328
Yes,but did he say who it was

634
00:53:54,124 --> 00:53:56,087
Somebody who couldn't or 
wouldn't let Vinson rest

635
00:53:56,323 --> 00:53:58,090
Had to take him out and hide him somewhere

636
00:53:58,995 --> 00:54:01,427
Anywhere so we couldn't look 
at the bullet and name a gun

637
00:54:02,077 --> 00:54:05,557
Somebody who knew that Vinson was 
never shot with Lucas Beauchamp 41 colt

638
00:54:06,003 --> 00:54:08,341
It is Vinson's partner in the 
lumber deal whoever that is

639
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:10,449
Because Lucas won't tell
 at least not to his lawyer

640
00:54:11,016 --> 00:54:13,197
You think his partner

641
00:54:13,197 --> 00:54:15,203
Who is Vinson's partner?

642
00:54:19,244 --> 00:54:20,414
We ain't found Vinson yet

643
00:54:20,464 --> 00:54:21,475
Set your dogs to find him

644
00:54:21,475 --> 00:54:22,551
Never mind the dogs

645
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:25,678
they'll trail and they'll catch anything 
that ever run or walked either

646
00:54:26,039 --> 00:54:28,843
But my boy never walked away
 from here and never left no trail

647
00:54:29,252 --> 00:54:32,580
Hush now,Mr Gowrie the man that carried
 him walked all by himself from here on

648
00:54:33,141 --> 00:54:35,875
And in dreadful terrifying hurry 
before two boys and an old woman

649
00:54:35,875 --> 00:54:38,750
 who came down that hill and discovered
 him at work,so he had to do it

650
00:54:38,831 --> 00:54:41,058
Hide what he had to carry 
and do it fast,sure and quiet

651
00:54:41,093 --> 00:54:42,922
There will be no more trace
 not for long time

652
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:44,603
A well or a river

653
00:54:44,963 --> 00:54:46,696
-Or sand
-Yeah,what sand!

654
00:54:46,756 --> 00:54:49,071
Right over the bridge,the horse 
wouldn't cross last night

655
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,180
Quicksand

656
00:54:50,426 --> 00:54:53,617
No,lawyer,put a man in 
quicksand,my boy in quicksand

657
00:54:53,617 --> 00:54:58,673
A man who would do a 
thing like that would..

658
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:39,428
Gowrie give me a hand

659
00:55:40,942 --> 00:55:43,009
Get the rope up the hound dogs

660
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:45,913
You cut a branch,any branch,
anything get him out of there

661
00:55:48,882 --> 00:55:49,942
Watch it boys

662
00:55:50,837 --> 00:55:51,896
Come on boys

663
00:55:52,324 --> 00:55:53,955
Hurry with that branch,come on let's go

664
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:55,078
Three or four down here

665
00:55:55,079 --> 00:55:56,079
Give me your hand now

666
00:55:58,187 --> 00:56:01,048
Here,I found him,I've started on him

667
00:56:01,717 --> 00:56:02,787
Hang up

668
00:56:13,254 --> 00:56:15,052
Here,bring it on,give me the pole

669
00:56:27,441 --> 00:56:28,481
Pull,pull

670
00:56:31,532 --> 00:56:32,540
Easy boys

671
00:56:34,612 --> 00:56:35,620
Pull

672
00:56:37,724 --> 00:56:38,807
Easy boy

673
00:56:40,332 --> 00:56:41,333
That's it

674
00:56:44,962 --> 00:56:45,968
That's it boys

675
00:56:53,428 --> 00:56:55,547
My boy,get my boy out of there

676
00:56:59,278 --> 00:57:01,181
All right,boys,pull,pull now

677
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:06,378
Easy boy

678
00:57:07,661 --> 00:57:08,676
Right over here boy

679
00:57:09,782 --> 00:57:10,859
Here we are

680
00:57:10,925 --> 00:57:11,986
Put him right here

681
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,135
There we are

682
00:57:16,034 --> 00:57:17,268
That's Vinson all right

683
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,321
John,let's get him away from the road

684
00:57:32,409 --> 00:57:34,687
At least get him back in the
 wood so they won't see him

685
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:37,307
Steady,they all passed by now anyway

686
00:57:37,307 --> 00:57:38,401
They are all in town by now

687
00:58:43,342 --> 00:58:45,625
Well they had to do it too hard,
just a three and a five

688
00:58:54,709 --> 00:58:57,185
Well,Mr. Gowrie,when you reckon
 you don't  get somebody?

689
00:58:57,185 --> 00:58:59,575
He's got to  wait on his brothers certainly

690
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:01,712
Where is your act Robert,
planting corn this morning?

691
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,624
Don't say that they are waiting 
to be called up for jury duty

692
01:00:20,842 --> 01:00:22,258
Get out of your way,Miss Habersham

693
01:00:23,153 --> 01:00:25,099
I'm very comfortable the way I am

694
01:00:32,555 --> 01:00:36,064
There is one way take and move
 her and chair out in the yard

695
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:38,624
Or else I could do this

696
01:01:04,109 --> 01:01:06,785
Please bring your step out of my
 light so I can straight my needle

697
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:22,848
Miss Hamersham,I'm not touching you,you 
are an old lady,but you are in the wrong

698
01:01:23,276 --> 01:01:24,601
You are fighting the whole county

699
01:01:25,452 --> 01:01:28,742
But you are getting tired,and when 
you do get tired,we are going in

700
01:01:30,631 --> 01:01:33,615
I'm going for the 80 
and I'm not tired yet

701
01:01:55,246 --> 01:01:56,253
Go home.

702
01:01:56,689 --> 01:01:57,705
Everyone of you

703
01:02:00,649 --> 01:02:01,800
Go on home

704
01:02:03,105 --> 01:02:04,323
You're ought to be ashamed

705
01:02:21,587 --> 01:02:23,431
I've never seen no man shoot Vinson Gowrie

706
01:02:23,816 --> 01:02:25,027
But you must know who shot him

707
01:02:26,263 --> 01:02:27,750
Don't you realize you'd never be safe

708
01:02:27,788 --> 01:02:29,680
Not until we know who is,
not until we find him

709
01:02:30,016 --> 01:02:32,962
Not until we put him right here in
 your place,on this bunk,in this cell

710
01:02:34,947 --> 01:02:37,114
You are a lawyer,you know the law

711
01:02:38,841 --> 01:02:41,604
Can you put a man in jail if 
you never seen him fire no shot?

712
01:02:41,684 --> 01:02:42,961
Your case is slightly different

713
01:02:43,136 --> 01:02:45,234
Can they take him out of 
jail and maybe burn him

714
01:02:45,234 --> 01:02:46,894
 if there are only suspicions and maybe..

715
01:02:46,994 --> 01:02:48,631
Listen,you were standing over a dead man

716
01:02:48,631 --> 01:02:50,509
you had a recently fired
 pistol in your pocket

717
01:02:50,509 --> 01:02:51,802
Do you call that just suspicion?

718
01:02:51,802 --> 01:02:52,984
-It was Saturday
-I know that

719
01:02:53,084 --> 01:02:54,336
Why did you carry a pistol?

720
01:02:54,388 --> 01:02:55,605
-Mr Carruthers
-Give it to you?

721
01:02:55,963 --> 01:02:57,044
Sold it to me

722
01:02:57,584 --> 01:02:59,453
-All right
-He always carry it on Saturdays

723
01:02:59,521 --> 01:03:00,620
But he was a white man

724
01:03:05,864 --> 01:03:09,239
So that's why,I see

725
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:11,602
When you dressed up on Saturday

726
01:03:11,702 --> 01:03:16,458
you wear the pistol exactly like old
 Carruthers did,just as simple as that

727
01:03:16,521 --> 01:03:18,290
Downstairs in the office they got my pistol

728
01:03:18,617 --> 01:03:21,052
And my hat and the toothpicks,
do I get them now or..

729
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:24,855
Lucas,last night I was wrong,you were 
right and Chick was right,and I was wrong

730
01:03:25,456 --> 01:03:26,887
Today I'm trying to save your life

731
01:03:26,887 --> 01:03:29,985
not for your own safe since you've been
throwing it away but for my own safe

732
01:03:30,194 --> 01:03:31,624
So I won't carry it on my conscious

733
01:03:31,759 --> 01:03:32,784
All right

734
01:03:35,177 --> 01:03:37,842
-What would you be satisfied with?
-The truth,nothing more

735
01:03:44,519 --> 01:03:46,622
There were two white folks 
partners in the saw mill

736
01:03:47,033 --> 01:03:49,934
And one was Vinson Gowrie,
yes,and the other?

737
01:03:50,861 --> 01:03:54,077
I do not sleep much nights.
So I taking to walking

738
01:03:54,077 --> 01:03:55,865
Not because you suspected 
anything of course

739
01:03:57,624 --> 01:04:02,418
I've taken to walking and in the
 dark I come near the saw mill

740
01:04:03,713 --> 01:04:06,962
And then I see the light
 coming straight at me

741
01:04:21,372 --> 01:04:24,228
Just like I told you that there were 
two folks partners in the saw mill

742
01:04:24,725 --> 01:04:28,946
And one of them was dealing with lumber
 every night maybe or every night he could

743
01:04:29,247 --> 01:04:30,306
And he's seen me

744
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:32,958
So I know that was the end of it

745
01:04:33,134 --> 01:04:34,535
Then I hear the mule

746
01:04:38,635 --> 01:04:39,691
This your lumber?

747
01:04:39,949 --> 01:04:41,040
Who drove that truck?

748
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:45,735
You see who drove that truck

749
01:04:54,562 --> 01:04:56,024
I knew that was not him neither

750
01:04:56,438 --> 01:04:58,972
Next Saturday afternoon I am on my
 way over to Fraser's store

751
01:04:59,342 --> 01:05:00,885
I see my Saturday supper

752
01:05:05,734 --> 01:05:06,758
But I missed him

753
01:05:07,733 --> 01:05:12,180
Two miles later when I come in sight of
 Fraser's store there was Vinson Gowrie

754
01:05:12,848 --> 01:05:16,195
He wanted to know before he beat
 me just who's been stealing the lumber

755
01:05:16,895 --> 01:05:19,117
Then I told him I ain't decided yet

756
01:05:19,885 --> 01:05:22,282
He told me,he reckon he has
 to beat it out of me then

757
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:26,390
He never did

758
01:05:27,103 --> 01:05:29,275
I don't know if it was a rifle

759
01:05:29,286 --> 01:05:30,395
It could have been a rifle

760
01:05:31,036 --> 01:05:32,870
But I've never seen who fired it

761
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:45,614
He could have picked me out and
 shut me up but he picked Vinson

762
01:05:46,856 --> 01:05:47,889
Do you know why?

763
01:05:48,298 --> 01:05:50,619
Because the murderer watched
 you every step of the way

764
01:05:50,973 --> 01:05:53,311
He saw you fire the rabbit 
and missed,it was his chance

765
01:05:53,330 --> 01:05:55,318
He murdered the man from 
whom he stole the money

766
01:05:55,319 --> 01:05:57,263
to see you lynched for
 that very same murder

767
01:05:57,295 --> 01:05:59,399
So he would be safe and you
 and Vinson would be dead

768
01:05:59,425 --> 01:06:00,673
The scheme should have worked

769
01:06:00,772 --> 01:06:03,110
by every reason of geography and psychology

770
01:06:03,110 --> 01:06:05,348
and the past 200 years of 
this county system

771
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:06,810
In fact it did work

772
01:06:07,456 --> 01:06:09,906
Except once long time ago
 and partly by chance

773
01:06:09,906 --> 01:06:12,993
a white boy fell into the
 creek on your property

774
01:06:16,773 --> 01:06:17,773
Hello,sheriff

775
01:06:17,848 --> 01:06:19,562
I don't know what you have done with Lucas

776
01:06:19,562 --> 01:06:22,229
but we got something out of Vinson Gowrie

777
01:06:23,406 --> 01:06:25,671
Lies just right back at his breastbone

778
01:06:27,354 --> 01:06:29,127
Fired by some kind of rifle

779
01:06:30,453 --> 01:06:31,462
Who fired that rifle?

780
01:06:32,426 --> 01:06:34,148
You forget I've not seen no rifle

781
01:06:34,492 --> 01:06:36,805
But certainly you must know
 or suspect or even guess

782
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:41,130
Not personally I do not want to send
 any man to jail I ain't seen personally

783
01:06:41,221 --> 01:06:42,351
Lucas,why don't you trust me

784
01:06:42,976 --> 01:06:44,036
There is no need to

785
01:06:44,395 --> 01:06:46,257
Listen to me,it wasn't your pistol,true

786
01:06:46,257 --> 01:06:48,228
you did not move the body 
down to the creek,true

787
01:06:48,464 --> 01:06:50,136
But you try to explain the truth to a mob

788
01:06:50,137 --> 01:06:52,707
who has been waiting down there
 all night for something to kill

789
01:06:52,719 --> 01:06:55,585
Don't you see you are not going 
to be safe until we catch the murderer

790
01:06:55,648 --> 01:06:57,463
All right I'll show you how to catch them

791
01:06:59,067 --> 01:07:00,958
Put your right fake in the right trap

792
01:07:00,958 --> 01:07:02,213
How do you propose to do that?

793
01:07:02,983 --> 01:07:04,485
Give me my hat and let me go home

794
01:07:04,768 --> 01:07:05,851
Can't do that

795
01:07:06,668 --> 01:07:10,148
Sure we can on the strength of 
this you are a free man now

796
01:07:11,205 --> 01:07:13,724
But you walk out this jail and 
you won't be alive 10 minutes

797
01:07:14,372 --> 01:07:15,789
And you would be lucky for less

798
01:07:16,375 --> 01:07:18,001
Shall I ask the sheriff to get your hat?

799
01:07:18,854 --> 01:07:20,594
And the pistol and my toothpick

800
01:07:21,062 --> 01:07:22,965
No,come on

801
01:07:34,209 --> 01:07:35,858
I think I got to be be hiding  in there

802
01:07:42,538 --> 01:07:44,164
You won't have to stay here much longer

803
01:07:44,264 --> 01:07:46,547
we are going to get this whole 
thing settled before dark

804
01:07:46,547 --> 01:07:49,589
All right I don't mind 
I've had lots of company

805
01:07:49,652 --> 01:07:50,731
So I see

806
01:07:56,623 --> 01:07:57,631
Lawyer

807
01:07:58,391 --> 01:07:59,449
Lawyer

808
01:08:01,838 --> 01:08:02,890
Lawyer

809
01:08:02,904 --> 01:08:04,828
That the second time you've
 been up seeing him

810
01:08:04,843 --> 01:08:05,466
Yes

811
01:08:05,467 --> 01:08:07,118
What can you actually do for him lawyer?

812
01:08:07,177 --> 01:08:08,177
Don't we treat you better

813
01:08:08,202 --> 01:08:09,228
Save his life

814
01:08:09,228 --> 01:08:11,699
You ain't been paid enough
 money to be able to do that,lawyer

815
01:08:11,798 --> 01:08:13,346
I've been paid nothing,there are 
some things you don't do for money

816
01:08:13,418 --> 01:08:15,717
I'm going up to my office and 
phone the District Attorney

817
01:08:15,717 --> 01:08:18,845
to get him to release this man,today so
 he can go home and finish his planting

818
01:08:24,178 --> 01:08:25,245
Wait

819
01:08:28,882 --> 01:08:31,912
So you are taking the case that is going 
to defend him hope to get him out

820
01:08:32,442 --> 01:08:34,415
-Yes
-And you call yourself white folk

821
01:08:34,487 --> 01:08:36,562
-Mr Gowrie
-And my brother was killed by that nigger

822
01:08:36,595 --> 01:08:38,474
-Lucas Beauchamp is innocent
-Not in this court

823
01:08:43,395 --> 01:08:46,275
I've seen a piece of evidence that
 I know would even convince you

824
01:09:00,837 --> 01:09:01,849
They don't believe you

825
01:09:02,241 --> 01:09:04,246
One of them does,the question is which one

826
01:09:05,613 --> 01:09:07,635
-But he will be cleared out of the county
-He might

827
01:09:07,666 --> 01:09:09,550
But there is one thing
 he is bound to do first

828
01:09:10,142 --> 01:09:12,777
He was frightened last night when
 he had to dig out of his grave

829
01:09:12,877 --> 01:09:16,676
the body of the man he shot, carrying
 downhill to find a place to bury him again

830
01:09:17,413 --> 01:09:19,706
All by himself furiously in the dark

831
01:09:20,448 --> 01:09:22,577
One man against the whole
 weight of the earth

832
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:24,288
What a hard that must have been

833
01:09:24,885 --> 01:09:27,427
And now today every hour that
 has happened since Saturday noon

834
01:09:27,427 --> 01:09:29,446
 must be gone together in his brain

835
01:09:30,512 --> 01:09:32,252
They don't know it out there,but he does

836
01:09:32,746 --> 01:09:33,866
He is lost,he is finished

837
01:09:35,066 --> 01:09:37,285
He is running through his last 
few pennies of freedom

838
01:09:38,031 --> 01:09:40,446
And I reckon he is going to 
spend the only way he knows

839
01:09:42,705 --> 01:09:43,858
On revenge

840
01:11:06,146 --> 01:11:09,300
You don't carry a 33 rifle
 do you,Mr Gowrie?

841
01:11:09,727 --> 01:11:10,805
No

842
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:13,060
Do you know anybody that does?

843
01:11:17,343 --> 01:11:18,378
Yes

844
01:11:29,842 --> 01:11:30,987
Sit down Mr Gowrie

845
01:11:32,836 --> 01:11:35,861
Don't sit down if you don't care to but
 at least get away from that window

846
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:37,466
You sent for me

847
01:11:37,836 --> 01:11:40,893
You phoned me set up a 
warrant see who killed my boy

848
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:42,424
He'll be here

849
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:46,935
Sooner or later before the day is over
  he will come to kill Lucas Beauchamp

850
01:11:51,596 --> 01:11:53,329
I don't see Lucas Beauchamp neither

851
01:11:57,048 --> 01:11:58,907
Now you do

852
01:12:18,023 --> 01:12:20,769
-Is that his wife?
-That his wife,she is dead

853
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:22,697
Two years now

854
01:12:23,070 --> 01:12:24,160
Maybe three

855
01:12:24,608 --> 01:12:26,625
Mine been gone twenty five years

856
01:12:28,485 --> 01:12:30,198
The day the twins was borne

857
01:12:31,102 --> 01:12:34,018
Raising all them boys by yourself is hard

858
01:12:42,892 --> 01:12:44,673
Five boys

859
01:12:56,396 --> 01:12:58,885
That wasn't shot with no 41 colt

860
01:13:02,190 --> 01:13:03,557
Come on out here you black nigger

861
01:13:09,868 --> 01:13:10,868
Wait a minute

862
01:13:15,051 --> 01:13:16,112
Get out of the way

863
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:17,248
You need help

864
01:13:17,897 --> 01:13:19,150
I don't want no help

865
01:13:21,112 --> 01:13:22,534
I'll do it myself

866
01:14:25,630 --> 01:14:27,435
Pa,you ain't got no business here

867
01:14:30,201 --> 01:14:31,298
Pa,get out of the way

868
01:14:31,522 --> 01:14:32,526
Put down that gun

869
01:14:34,747 --> 01:14:36,846
Is this the gun that killed 
your brother Vinson?

870
01:15:47,732 --> 01:15:49,135
Is he the one,sheriff?

871
01:15:52,868 --> 01:15:55,800
That's right,he is the one

872
01:15:56,021 --> 01:15:57,437
The man who killed his brother

873
01:15:58,466 --> 01:15:59,522
Ask him

874
01:16:00,016 --> 01:16:01,111
Is that right,Nub!

875
01:16:02,966 --> 01:16:05,960
That's right,he killed him

876
01:17:23,752 --> 01:17:24,796
They are running away

877
01:17:25,319 --> 01:17:26,414
There is more than that

878
01:17:27,196 --> 01:17:31,102
No,that's all,there is nothing left to do
 than to admit that they are wrong

879
01:17:31,102 --> 01:17:32,312
So they are riding away

880
01:17:32,804 --> 01:17:34,138
It's worse than that

881
01:17:34,179 --> 01:17:35,954
Then they are running from Lucas Beauchamp

882
01:17:36,291 --> 01:17:37,716
-No
-Yes

883
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:39,983
They won't even wait to 
buy him a can of tobacco

884
01:17:39,983 --> 01:17:42,035
to show him getting for
 all the trouble he cost

885
01:17:42,943 --> 01:17:46,026
Then what's the hurry? They know they
 got the rest of their lives to do that

886
01:17:46,833 --> 01:17:51,286
From coffins,so they wont have to bury him,
they are running away from coffins

887
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:54,269
Not from Lucas and not from coffins

888
01:17:54,746 --> 01:17:56,584
Well,they are running,you can't change that

889
01:17:56,992 --> 01:17:58,857
No,I can't change that

890
01:18:00,157 --> 01:18:02,025
They are running away from themselves

891
01:18:04,389 --> 01:18:05,714
Hi,Miss Eunice what's the hurry?

892
01:18:06,540 --> 01:18:11,617
I got to get home to my chickens but 
if you ever get trouble again let me know

893
01:18:14,971 --> 01:18:18,474
You see,we were in trouble,
not Lucas Beauchamp

894
01:18:22,801 --> 01:18:24,134
It's all right,Chick

895
01:18:24,530 --> 01:18:26,350
-Is it?
-It will be all right

896
01:18:27,184 --> 01:18:31,064
So long some of us,you,Miss Habersham,
and Aleck and maybe me

897
01:18:31,064 --> 01:18:34,741
or even so long one of us,
someone of us doesn't run away

898
01:19:13,549 --> 01:19:15,091
-Uncle John
-Chick

899
01:19:15,449 --> 01:19:18,132
It's a fine Saturday afternoon
 why don't you go to the ball games

900
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:19,298
Lucas is coming here

901
01:19:20,549 --> 01:19:24,292
Well,he is a gentleman,he won't tell
 me in the face I was wrong

902
01:19:26,375 --> 01:19:27,433
Come in Lucas

903
01:19:38,850 --> 01:19:41,565
Young man you seldom go fishing lately

904
01:19:41,621 --> 01:19:43,558
I'm waiting for you getting nice new ...

905
01:19:44,086 --> 01:19:45,882
You are welcome whether
 it is frozen or not

906
01:19:46,347 --> 01:19:47,377
Have a seat Lucas

907
01:19:50,934 --> 01:19:52,653
I believe you got a little bill against me

908
01:19:53,071 --> 01:19:54,731
Not me I didn't do anything

909
01:19:54,862 --> 01:19:57,197
That boy there is the reason
you are walking around today

910
01:19:57,591 --> 01:19:58,894
All right,I'll pay him

911
01:19:58,894 --> 01:20:00,939
You can't,he'll be practising
 law without a licence

912
01:20:02,098 --> 01:20:03,843
I'll pay your expenses then

913
01:20:06,340 --> 01:20:08,141
The only expense I had
 was having this fixed

914
01:20:08,241 --> 01:20:10,036
-How much?
-2 $

915
01:20:10,598 --> 01:20:11,166
2 $

916
01:20:12,488 --> 01:20:13,953
That don't seem that much to me

917
01:20:14,858 --> 01:20:19,634
First I'm a farming man use a law man

918
01:20:20,207 --> 01:20:23,991
I don't reckon it is my business
 to try to learn yours

919
01:20:24,325 --> 01:20:26,717
-That is one dollar in four bits
-Never mind that

920
01:20:33,004 --> 01:20:35,699
That makes it out four bits in pennies

921
01:20:36,428 --> 01:20:39,359
 I was aiming to take them to the bank
 but you could save me the trouble

922
01:20:41,078 --> 01:20:44,673
-You want to count them?
-Yes,but you are paying,you count them

923
01:20:48,175 --> 01:20:49,238
There is 50 of them

924
01:20:49,335 --> 01:20:50,408
This is business

925
01:20:53,493 --> 01:20:56,028
As long as you are paying your debts
,go and see Miss Habersham

926
01:20:56,654 --> 01:20:59,916
15,20 I ain't much of a visiting man

927
01:20:59,916 --> 01:21:01,642
You could bring her some flowers

928
01:21:03,918 --> 01:21:06,109
I've had no flowers to speak 
of since Molly died

929
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:08,668
Chick's mother will fetch
 some of your garden

930
01:21:08,895 --> 01:21:10,081
You owe her that much,Lucas

931
01:21:10,875 --> 01:21:14,863
She is the only lady anywhere that
 ever held a jail full of threats

932
01:21:16,685 --> 01:21:19,353
All right,anything more to satisfy you

933
01:21:20,105 --> 01:21:21,420
Just one thing more

934
01:21:21,696 --> 01:21:23,103
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

935
01:21:23,562 --> 01:21:24,685
That night in the jail

936
01:21:26,875 --> 01:21:28,237
Would you have believed me?

937
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:48,604
No,what what are you waiting for now?

938
01:21:51,777 --> 01:21:53,146
My receipt

939
01:22:17,938 --> 01:22:19,859
They don't see him as though
 it never happened

940
01:22:20,051 --> 01:22:21,102
They see him

941
01:22:21,482 --> 01:22:23,345
No,they don't know that he is even there

942
01:22:23,345 --> 01:22:27,246
But they do same as I do,they
 always will as long as he lives

943
01:22:27,884 --> 01:22:33,795
Proud,stubborn,insufferable but 
there he goes keep on my conscience

944
01:22:34,611 --> 01:22:36,627
Our conscience,Uncle John

945
01:22:41,913 --> 01:22:43,396
