1
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,375
THE FEWER CHILDREN YOU HAVE,
THE BETTER THEY ARE

2
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:02,333
CONTRIBUTE TO YOUR COUNTRY

3
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:18,625
SHU NA

4
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,583
SUCH NICE WEATHER TODAY, GREAT FOR MOVIES.

5
00:01:57,666 --> 00:02:00,208
{\an8}AS A VIEWER, THE MORE YOU WATCH,
THE MORE YOU COMPREHEND.

6
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:03,500
{\an8}THANK YOU TO THE DIRECTOR
AND ALL THE STAFF!

7
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:05,625
{\an8}WE HAVE TO ACCEPT IMPERFECTION,
AS PERFECTION NO LONGER EXISTS.

8
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,416
Where did you go?

9
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,541
I got lost.

10
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:38,375
Are you sure this is the place?

11
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:42,208
I'm very sure it's here.

12
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:46,000
Why are the lights off?

13
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,458
It's a power cut.
Aren't you used to them yet?

14
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:55,416
Nurse, we are here to sell.

15
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,500
Of course you are here to sell.

16
00:02:57,583 --> 00:03:00,083
- You can't be here to buy, can you?
- You don't have to be so loud.

17
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,625
What are you shy about?

18
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,833
All these people are here
for the same reason.

19
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,125
Fill out this form.

20
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,500
Wait over there.

21
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,958
<i>That's right.
This is not an ordinary love story.</i>

22
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,958
<i>Don't misunderstand.
I don't mean the two of us.</i>

23
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,291
<i>My name is Hui. I am a blogger.</i>

24
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:15,875
<i>My online nickname is "Frog Prince."</i>

25
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:19,916
<i>This one who looks more like a toad
is my uncle, Mark Gao.</i>

26
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,416
<i>How did we end up here?</i>

27
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,208
<i>We will have to start this story
28 months ago.</i>

28
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:30,708
Stop running! Stop! Give me back my money!

29
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,750
- Pay me back!
- Stop running!

30
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,625
Pay me back!

31
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,083
Granny!

32
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,125
Granny!

33
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:58,583
We're in a pickle!

34
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,291
Pickle's good. Come on, let's eat.

35
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,333
That's not funny.

36
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,291
We really need to be on the run now.

37
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,500
You say that every time,
but you've never run a single time.

38
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,791
Even this time, you swam.

39
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,000
Granny! Stop kidding!

40
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,333
Now what have you done?

41
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:18,041
The number given by that
don't-know-what temple struck third prize.

42
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,375
But I forgot to place my bet.

43
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,750
Amazing!

44
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,833
You're even greater than the deity.

45
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,833
How could you even forget
the number given by the deity?

46
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,125
What should I do now?

47
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,000
Granny, I'm going to bathe.

48
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:40,541
Tell me what to do after that.

49
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,125
Help me think about it.

50
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,541
<i>Although I'm called "Frog Prince,"</i>

51
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,375
<i>I don't want to be "a frog in the well."</i>

52
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:53,125
<i>Of course, I will take this opportunity
to go see the world!</i>

53
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:56,916
<i>But I didn't expect that this would be
how I'd eventually meet my destiny.</i>

54
00:04:58,208 --> 00:04:59,458
Hey!

55
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,916
Get in! Or are you waiting for
the cops to come?

56
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,166
<i>Like I said, he's my uncle.</i>

57
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,125
<i>And he's a very troublesome uncle.</i>

58
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,750
Uncle! This is cool!

59
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,291
How's the car?

60
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:16,750
It's really not too bad.

61
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,125
It's clearly written.
Here, see for yourself.

62
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,666
If any more new cars come in,
remember to call me for a test drive.

63
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,291
- No problem.
- Otherwise, I'll be angry.

64
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,291
- No problem.
- It's a deal then.

65
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:27,916
Let's go!

66
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,208
- Mark!
- What?

67
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:30,833
So that supercar is not yours?

68
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,666
Now, I want to get a Ferrari. Can't I?

69
00:05:57,416 --> 00:06:02,500
Sorry! I'm sorry, sir. Sorry. How are you?

70
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,875
Did you think you were Alonso,
to be speeding as fast?

71
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:08,958
Of course not. I'm shooting a film now.

72
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,750
- Shooting a film?
- Yeah.

73
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,500
- Where are the actors?
- Me. I'm the actor.

74
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,708
- And the cameras?
- Cameras are there. There.

75
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:19,291
There's one there. There's one here.
There's one more there.

76
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,291
Technology has become very advanced.

77
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:24,375
There are wireless cameras everywhere.

78
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:29,583
Yes, our crew is the best
of the best in Asia.

79
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:33,041
Our boss is Andy Lau from Hong Kong.

80
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,791
- Andy Lau?
- That's right!

81
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:38,625
- Andy Lau, I know him.
- Our producer is from China.

82
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,541
Feng Xiaogang!

83
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,208
Do you know Mr. Feng?

84
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:45,250
- Mr. Feng, I know him too.
- You know Mr. Feng but not Feng Xiaogang?

85
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:47,250
Our director is famous.

86
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:51,500
He's the Singaporean director, Jack Neo.

87
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,333
- Jack Neo?
- Yes, that's him.

88
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:54,625
- Do you like him?
- A lot!

89
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,416
- I know him well. You want his autograph?
- Yes.

90
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,500
Okay, I can do that, I'll get it for you.

91
00:06:58,583 --> 00:06:59,750
What is your movie about?

92
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:03,041
I cannot tell you. It's a secret.

93
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,750
Just reveal a bit.

94
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,625
Okay fine, fine.
Since we are best friends now.

95
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:10,666
This movie is about a race car driver.

96
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,000
A race car driver.

97
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,458
- A race car driver?
- That's right!

98
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:18,250
- I know.
- One day, he joined the gangsters.

99
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:22,791
- Wow, that's very dangerous.
- Yeah, but that's how the script goes.

100
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:27,833
One day, his boss tells him to
smuggle illegal substances.

101
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,333
- And after that?
- Drugs and other things.

102
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:34,250
- Unfortunately, he gets caught.
- What happens in the end?

103
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,583
Go watch it when the film is released.

104
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,208
- Then you'll know.
- Tell me a little.

105
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,208
Okay, okay. Apparently, the cop
who stopped him was a good person.

106
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:44,500
- Like me. I am also a good person.
- Yes, but you are more handsome.

107
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,125
- How do you know?
- For sure.

108
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:52,916
Then the kind cop let him go.

109
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,916
Is that okay? Can I go now?
Here, smile at the camera.

110
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,708
So I'll go now, okay?

111
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:02,583
SUMMONS

112
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:06,875
<i>By now, you'll have understood the reason
we ended up having to go sell</i>

113
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:09,875
<i>is definitely because of this Mark Gao</i>

114
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:13,083
<i>who thinks he knows everything
and is filled with crazy ideas.</i>

115
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:16,875
With Super Marky,
you will all be Super Pretty!

116
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:20,125
<i>He looks as if he needs a makeover,
yet he dares to sell beauty products.</i>

117
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,541
<i>I smell trouble!</i>

118
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:24,083
Free of charge! Free product
demonstration. Who would like to try?

119
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:31,291
Ladies, how can I help you?

120
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,375
Mark Gao, your "Snowy Cream"
has caused my face to bleed!

121
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:36,458
And your "Whitie Mask"
has caused blackheads all over my nose!

122
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:38,958
We want a refund!

123
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,041
Ouch!

124
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:45,916
Not a single cent left for me.

125
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,416
Yeah. All we have is this useless piece.

126
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:55,416
Where there's a will there's a way.

127
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,083
Sell your car and we should be
covered for a while.

128
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:06,375
I only missed one payment
and you tow my car?

129
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,666
Egg roll, lotus cake, yam cake, egg tart!

130
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,833
- Hey!
- What?

131
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,916
Can you not mention food
at a time like this?

132
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,083
- What should we do?
- What do you mean what should we do?

133
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,875
Earn money to buy food.

134
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,041
<i>Back to my old trade.</i>

135
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,750
<i>How do you survive on
one vacuum cleaner sale per month?</i>

136
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,250
<i>Finally, my chance to show my prowess.</i>

137
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,875
<i>This is not style!</i>

138
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:32,458
<i>Goodness, is there a job in this world
where you're paid for idling?</i>

139
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,833
There is. Rob someone.

140
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,125
Rob someone?

141
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,333
- No way!
- Correct.

142
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:39,583
We could be arrested by the police.

143
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:42,125
The police don't have time to arrest you.

144
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,708
If that's the case...

145
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,708
- Okay then. Let's go rob someone.
- Where should we do it?

146
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,250
Here.

147
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,083
Are you robbing us?

148
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,166
We don't have money.

149
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,375
- Ouch!
- Don't try us!

150
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,500
I know Snake Palm.

151
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:04,291
- Dragon Fist.
- Praying Mantis.

152
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:07,291
And also Tiger Strike!

153
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:15,000
<i>To pay off our debts and buy food,
we had to resort to selling.</i>

154
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,708
Does it hurt?

155
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,375
Here are your chocolates and biscuits.

156
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,625
- Miss.
- Yes?

157
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,291
- Is this all?
- It's done.

158
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,125
You must be kidding.

159
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:38,583
Let me give you another pack of biscuits.

160
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,875
Stop kidding.

161
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,125
We get paid, right?

162
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,041
No payment will be made.
Thank you for your charity.

163
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,291
Charity?

164
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:52,416
This is absurd!

165
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,000
We give you charity,
but who's going to give us charity?

166
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,375
I donated so much blood,

167
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,708
even squeezing out a few large drops.

168
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,541
- We really don't get paid?
- Yeah?

169
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:02,833
Are you sure we don't get paid?

170
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,500
Are you really sure we don't get paid?

171
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,291
Fine! I'll take back my blood!

172
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,541
Sir, you can't do that!

173
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:13,916
You!

174
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,666
- Thank you for your charity.
- Sir!

175
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,583
Now what else can we do?

176
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:26,041
See if there's anything else we can sell!

177
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,291
BE HANDSOME, SELL HANDSOME,
BE PAID HANDSOMELY.

178
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,750
Nurse, we are here to sell...

179
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,875
Of course you are here to sell!

180
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:48,333
- You can't be here to buy, can you?
- You don't have to be so loud.

181
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,833
Fill out this form.

182
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,083
Wait over there.

183
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,458
Whoa!

184
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,083
What?

185
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,916
- I can't do it!
- You can't do it?

186
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,750
No, the DVD player in my room
is not working.

187
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,291
Mine isn't working either.

188
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:48,375
- Your isn't working either?
- Not here, over there!

189
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,416
- What now?
- Read the magazine!

190
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,583
- I can't turn the page.
- Give it to me!

191
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,041
Didn't make it?

192
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,375
The mood just isn't right for us.

193
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,458
Nurse, this needs patience.

194
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:11,541
What?

195
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:34,000
<i>We're not perverts who go crazy
at the sight of a woman.</i>

196
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:38,041
<i>Actually, she's my dream girl,
my princess.</i>

197
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:41,000
<i>We have a destiny!</i>

198
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:42,916
<i>What kind of destiny?</i>

199
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,208
<i>I have to thank Mark Gao for that.</i>

200
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,625
<i>If not for him,</i>

201
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,375
<i>my princess and I wouldn't have met.</i>

202
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:54,958
Hello?

203
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,291
Can you let me drive the car?

204
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,916
- No.
- Why not?

205
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,250
No means no.

206
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,291
If you make any more noise,
I'll throw you out of the car.

207
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,000
Stingy.

208
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,833
- Why is it so jammed?
- There are lots of cars.

209
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:15,958
You think I can't see that myself?
I meant, why are there so many cars?

210
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,125
Drive! Quick!

211
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,541
- Miss, how can I help you?
- Drive! Don't talk!

212
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,625
- I'd like to, but it's jammed up ahead.
- Have you stared enough?!

213
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,375
Isn't there a space over there? Quick!

214
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:34,666
- Okay, okay.
- Quick!

215
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,791
What are you staring at?! Quick! Drive!

216
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:43,833
Quick!

217
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:48,000
Quick! Drive!

218
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:57,833
Miss, this guy is jinxed.

219
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,083
If I were you,

220
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,958
I'd use five types of ingredients
to wash off the bad luck.

221
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:08,375
Use coriander, lemon grass,
grasshopper, butterfly, and bees.

222
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:11,791
Blend them together and then...

223
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,416
Hey, miss!

224
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,541
We met her at the same time,
and you claim to be the lucky one?

225
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,666
Who told you to say "no" earlier?

226
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,625
Otherwise, you would have
been the lucky one.

227
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,291
{\an8}LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT WITH MY PRINCESS

228
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,666
Where did you go?

229
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:31,875
Hang on.

230
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:34,166
I think I saw something
that shouldn't be her,

231
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,625
but I wouldn't mind seeing it every day.

232
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,541
Look!

233
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,958
It's her again!

234
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,791
Miss, remember me?

235
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:51,333
Who would remember a common face
like yours?

236
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,750
Miss, remember me?

237
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,166
The one who drove you this morning?

238
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:04,250
Xiao Hui! It's me!

239
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,083
She's smiling at me.

240
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,291
Are you sure you are the one
she's looking at?

241
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:23,666
LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT WITH MY PRINCESS

242
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,000
<i>Meeting once can be an accident.</i>

243
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,875
<i>Twice can be a coincidence.</i>

244
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,875
<i>But three times in a day?</i>

245
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,250
<i>That's definitely destiny!</i>

246
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,291
What are you looking at?

247
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:53,541
Come in!

248
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,583
- Quick!
- What are you doing?

249
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,000
Do you know the limit of
a man's alcohol intake?

250
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,958
- What is it?
- Ten glasses.

251
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:19,583
- What about women?
- For women, it's...

252
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:22,041
For women is eight and a half glasses.

253
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,333
She should be reaching her limit soon.

254
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,083
What do you want to do?

255
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:29,916
What? When she's drunk
and I'm not drunk yet,

256
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,458
I will...

257
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,166
You'll what? I'm warning you,
don't try to be funny!

258
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,583
I'll take her home.
What did you think I was thinking?

259
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,250
Stop being dirty-minded!

260
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:40,375
I'm being clear-minded.

261
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:44,125
She's your future aunt,
so don't act funny!

262
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,541
Say that to yourself!

263
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:46,625
Miss Shu.

264
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:55,833
- What are you doing?
- Take care of her.

265
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:13,958
Here's your bill, RM 1,350.

266
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,041
Whoa!

267
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,875
Move away!

268
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,166
Ouch!

269
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:26,625
THE FOURTH MEETING
WITH MY PRINCESS WAS FASCINATING!

270
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:29,708
Miss Shu Na.

271
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,041
Miss Shu Na.

272
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,000
What are you doing here?

273
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,625
Oh right, why did you suddenly disappear
from the Karaoke room?

274
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:37,250
- Where did you go?
- Hey! I don't know you!

275
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,625
How come she doesn't seem to recognize us?

276
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,041
She says she doesn't know you.

277
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:45,833
What is she doing here?

278
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,666
If men are here to sell,

279
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,791
women should be here to buy.

280
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:53,041
You mean artificial insemination?

281
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,458
Looks like you're the one who needs it!

282
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,625
In order to need this...

283
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,916
A, her husband "cannot."

284
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,250
Or B, her husband is dead.

285
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,041
Thus, she wants to be a single mother.

286
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,208
It must be one of these.

287
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,208
It's so pitiful.

288
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,166
Being a single mother is tough.

289
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,333
Yeah.

290
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,416
Why go through so much trouble
with artificial insemination?

291
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,000
Just sleeping with me will do it.

292
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:06,250
{\an8}FORBIDDEN APPLE

293
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,291
{\an8}KING OF FORBIDDEN FRUIT

294
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:24,666
I'm going to the toilet!

295
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:33,541
I somehow feel like I've disgraced
and defied our ancestors.

296
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,625
Why?

297
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,500
You were great!

298
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,875
You've finally become a true man.

299
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:42,833
Your semen is getting a woman pregnant.

300
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:43,833
Impressive!

301
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:49,291
Yeah, but who will be bearing my child?

302
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,875
Where will he be born?

303
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:55,375
I don't think he'll ever have the chance
to call me "dad."

304
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:59,416
Think big and become great.

305
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,916
Think about this.

306
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,541
What if a multi-billionaire
bought your semen?

307
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:08,583
Your son may become her heir!

308
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,208
If that happens,
share some of the money with me.

309
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,833
Do such coincidences exist?

310
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,750
Is that really possible?

311
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:20,625
If it isn't, why are you smiling so slyly?

312
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:26,458
I was just thinking, what if it's Shu Na
who gets my semen?

313
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,916
- Impossible!
- Why not?

314
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,666
Didn't you just say dream big
and become great?

315
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,166
That ain't a dream.

316
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,875
That's called a daydream!

317
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:52,375
Even if it was going to be
so coincidental, it would be me!

318
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:45,250
Little mice, climbed up the lamppost,
ate some oil,

319
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:47,500
can't get down,

320
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:50,458
and came rolling down.

321
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:52,583
Are you not daydreaming?

322
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:54,666
Nope! These are dreams!

323
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,833
Yeah, only in your dreams!

324
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:58,916
<i>I won't give up!</i>

325
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,291
<i>I will continue my visits
to the sperm bank.</i>

326
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:04,416
<i>This will increase the chances
of Shu Na buying my semen.</i>

327
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,416
<i>Where there's a will, there's a way.</i>

328
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,291
Mark, why are you here too?

329
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:12,333
Shu Na needs high-quality semen, okay?

330
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:14,375
We can also make some extra cash
at the same time.

331
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:17,291
What's that?

332
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:19,625
- Chicken essence.
- What for?

333
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:21,375
It's good for your "health."

334
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:22,666
I want some too!

335
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,666
It's all gone!

336
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,166
You are so selfish!

337
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,875
WORKING HARD, SAVING UP!

338
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:31,416
<i>For the future of my princess
and our child,</i>

339
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,541
<i>I'll work extra hard.</i>

340
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:35,208
<i>Even if I have to take up several jobs
at the same time, no problem!</i>

341
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,583
Hello, everyone. We are performing
a live radio broadcast.

342
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:47,208
Hello, everyone!
For our special segment today,

343
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:49,833
we have an audience member on the line
ready to perform.

344
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:51,791
Hello, how are you doing?

345
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,000
Hello? I'm telling a very colorful story!

346
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:34,416
Do you understand?

347
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:05,625
Ladies and gentlemen!

348
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:07,625
Come take a look! Grab a good deal!

349
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:11,750
- Eat more Bird Nest products.
- Babies will become smarter!

350
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:15,458
- Eat better with Bird Nest.
- Mommies get prettier.

351
00:25:15,541 --> 00:25:19,666
- They're good for you!
- The price is even better!

352
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,916
Don't miss this great deal!

353
00:25:58,166 --> 00:26:00,208
- Hey, it's Shu Na!
- What?

354
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:02,916
Can such coincidences really happen?
This is not a movie!

355
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,625
She appears in front of us
every two minutes.

356
00:26:05,708 --> 00:26:07,708
You don't believe me?
Let's go and find out!

357
00:26:08,916 --> 00:26:12,375
- Let go of me! Go to hell!
- Shut up!

358
00:26:12,458 --> 00:26:14,208
- Go to hell!
- Shut up!

359
00:26:14,291 --> 00:26:16,416
Bitch! If you have time, why don't
you keep an eye on your husband?!

360
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,708
- Stop your rogue behavior!
- What a slut!

361
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:21,375
So, you're here.

362
00:26:21,458 --> 00:26:23,375
Who are you calling "slut"?!
Say that again, I dare you!

363
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:28,000
Let me tell you, I am not scared of you
just because you shut down my boutique!

364
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:30,125
Cut my credit card
and then I'll be scared of you!

365
00:26:30,208 --> 00:26:31,833
- Stop messing with me!
- Shut up!

366
00:26:31,916 --> 00:26:34,125
What are you laughing at? Stop laughing!

367
00:26:34,208 --> 00:26:36,791
Your husband loves kids
but you can't have any.

368
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:38,666
I can give one to him!
What did I do wrong?!

369
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,250
Why are you treating me like this?

370
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:42,208
Oh, so Shu Na is a mistress.

371
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:43,416
What do you want?

372
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,875
Then why she did need
artificial insemination?

373
00:26:44,958 --> 00:26:47,541
I've seen many sluts, but I've
never seen anyone as crazy as you!

374
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:50,083
It's your husband who sends me
a hundred roses every day

375
00:26:50,166 --> 00:26:52,125
and a diamond every week!

376
00:26:52,208 --> 00:26:54,083
He even gave me houses and cars.

377
00:26:54,166 --> 00:26:56,166
I didn't force him to do it.
He did it willingly.

378
00:26:56,708 --> 00:26:58,583
- Slut!
- Shut up!

379
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:01,750
As long as your child is not born,
don't ever dream of becoming a Lee!

380
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:04,000
Then go ahead and kill me
and my baby! Fool!

381
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:05,833
You think I don't dare?

382
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:10,458
Friends from the media,
inside here is the tycoon's wife!

383
00:27:10,541 --> 00:27:11,541
- Here she is!
- Don't shoot!

384
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:15,083
Her husband impregnated a young lady,
and now the wife wants to kill them!

385
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:16,500
This is headline news!

386
00:27:16,583 --> 00:27:17,750
You watch your step!

387
00:27:17,833 --> 00:27:19,916
- Move away.
- That's her!

388
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,166
Take photos of her! That's her back,
put photos of it in the news!

389
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,333
- Don't shoot!
- Enough, let's go!

390
00:27:24,416 --> 00:27:25,458
- Don't shoot!
- You're safe now.

391
00:27:25,541 --> 00:27:29,416
Don't be afraid. They're just extras.
I called Orange and asked them to come.

392
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,083
Yes, that was my idea. Aren't I smart?

393
00:27:32,166 --> 00:27:34,833
You are very forgetful.
It was me who made the call to Orange.

394
00:27:34,916 --> 00:27:37,375
It was only a few of them.

395
00:27:37,458 --> 00:27:39,500
I could have dealt with them with my fist.

396
00:27:39,583 --> 00:27:41,583
What if they'd had backup outside?

397
00:27:41,666 --> 00:27:45,375
- Safety first, safety first.
- I am sure you can deal with a few.

398
00:27:45,458 --> 00:27:48,583
But we weren't sure if there were more.

399
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:50,375
I could have dealt with them
even if there had been.

400
00:27:50,458 --> 00:27:53,916
I am afraid they are the ones
who would have been dealing with you.

401
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:58,625
Okay, I remember.

402
00:27:58,708 --> 00:28:03,500
I am free next week.
We'll go for a meal and a movie together.

403
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:06,583
Okay. You'd better keep
your promise to me.

404
00:28:06,666 --> 00:28:08,250
Okay.

405
00:28:09,208 --> 00:28:11,875
- I am going to make that bitch pay!
- You're going for revenge?

406
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:13,708
I can help you. Let's go.

407
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:18,375
Ouch!

408
00:28:18,458 --> 00:28:20,083
What's wrong?

409
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:22,416
- Ouch!
- She must be injured!

410
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,750
- How do you know?
- She screamed so loudly just now.

411
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:26,666
She can't possibly have just
been singing, right?

412
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:29,666
Stop talking nonsense. Get your guys
to take her to the hospital. Quick!

413
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,000
- It hurts!
- Stand up. Be careful.

414
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:34,875
Don't follow us! Otherwise, I won't
have time next week to see you.

415
00:28:34,958 --> 00:28:36,125
Be careful.

416
00:28:38,375 --> 00:28:40,583
<i>For all my destined meetings
with my princess,</i>

417
00:28:40,666 --> 00:28:42,000
<i>Mark has also been there.</i>

418
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:45,166
<i>How can I be so sure this is my destiny?</i>

419
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:48,333
<i>Because Mark has a girlfriend already.</i>

420
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,791
What's going on?

421
00:28:58,458 --> 00:28:59,541
Open the window.

422
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,666
Soup with cordyceps.

423
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,208
It's good for your liver.

424
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,541
I've already got someone
to fix the toilet at your house.

425
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:25,333
Remember to put away your clothes
when you get home.

426
00:29:25,958 --> 00:29:27,625
It's been raining a lot lately.

427
00:29:27,708 --> 00:29:29,416
Clothes are hard to get dry.

428
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:31,916
Also...

429
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:37,750
don't leave your pants lying around.

430
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,333
Okay. Dismissed! Go!

431
00:29:42,625 --> 00:29:43,791
Okay.

432
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Hey.

433
00:29:58,083 --> 00:29:59,625
I've told you many times.

434
00:29:59,708 --> 00:30:01,791
Don't come in without my permission.

435
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:06,375
This is my house!
I can come and go as I like.

436
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:21,958
What else?

437
00:30:22,041 --> 00:30:23,416
Pay your rent!

438
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:27,250
Rent?

439
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:30,625
I have a relative coming
to see me, I'm busy.

440
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:34,666
What relative?
Have you got your period or what?

441
00:30:35,541 --> 00:30:37,708
Hello, Aunty.

442
00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:42,750
Uncle, Aunty.

443
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:46,916
Good boy.

444
00:30:47,541 --> 00:30:49,541
How much rent does my uncle owe you?

445
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:51,666
Five candlelight dinners,

446
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,416
six movies,

447
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,291
and seven nights of karaoke.

448
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:59,333
Those are rent?

449
00:30:59,416 --> 00:31:03,166
Do you really think
he can afford the rental?

450
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:08,541
Come!

451
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:10,916
Three days.

452
00:31:11,791 --> 00:31:14,250
If you don't pay me in three days,
you will have to...

453
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:17,000
marry me.

454
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,541
Marry you?!

455
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:20,625
Three days!

456
00:31:23,708 --> 00:31:27,291
<i>You will be marrying me in three days</i>

457
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:30,041
<i>You will be marrying me in three days</i>

458
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:34,416
{\an8}MARK: SHAMELESS!
SUSIE: SISTER! CONGRATULATIONS!

459
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,875
- Thank you, doctor.
- Goodbye, nurse.

460
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:39,791
You heard what the doctor said.
Although the baby is fine...

461
00:31:39,875 --> 00:31:42,375
- Do not get too emotional...
- Or argue with anyone.

462
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:45,125
- Or even fight with anyone.
- Do you understand?

463
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:47,208
Do you want to play tennis?

464
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,875
What is she doing?

465
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:54,291
Put it away properly.
You're not a kid anymore.

466
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:58,625
Oh no, not again! What are you doing?

467
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,916
Enough! Cut it out!

468
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,958
Let go!

469
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:04,208
You didn't see anything. You see nothing.

470
00:32:06,416 --> 00:32:09,541
Don't be impulsive!

471
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:13,000
Relax! Breathe!

472
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:16,000
Breathe. Let me tell you,

473
00:32:16,083 --> 00:32:19,000
the most important this now is
the safety of you and your baby!

474
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:24,291
Come! Create out, breathe in...

475
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:27,125
<i>It's been six months since I last saw her.</i>

476
00:32:27,208 --> 00:32:29,000
<i>She is pregnant!</i>

477
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:31,541
<i>Is this our destiny?</i>

478
00:32:31,625 --> 00:32:35,291
<i>Could my princess be carrying my baby?</i>

479
00:32:35,375 --> 00:32:36,583
HAPPILY EVER AFTER
MARK: PLEASE RESPECT YOUR AUNT

480
00:32:36,666 --> 00:32:37,958
SHE HAS YOUR FUTURE COUSIN
INSIDE HER TUMMY.

481
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:39,833
This is my room.

482
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:42,125
Actually, I have a bigger house,
but it's under renovation.

483
00:32:42,208 --> 00:32:44,916
Once it's ready, we can move in.

484
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,250
Yeah, right. This fool!

485
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:49,500
He's always daydreaming.

486
00:32:49,583 --> 00:32:50,958
Hey, mind your manners.

487
00:32:51,041 --> 00:32:53,416
Be careful, or I will beat you up.

488
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,541
- I am so scared.
- Scared, right?

489
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:58,375
My apologies for the mess here.

490
00:32:58,458 --> 00:33:00,000
But don't worry.

491
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:02,958
- Mark! Look at your stuff!
- Be careful!

492
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:04,833
- Those are branded!
- I don't know how you live your life!

493
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:06,541
Be careful, that's imported from Italy.

494
00:33:08,916 --> 00:33:11,291
Don't worry, I'll tidy this place
for you tomorrow.

495
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:13,416
Right! That's his job.

496
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:15,875
Why are you guys being so nice to me?

497
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:18,250
Because fate brought us together.

498
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:19,333
Yes!

499
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:21,708
The first time,
you hopped into my sports car.

500
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,916
The one you were testing for the showroom.

501
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,583
The second time we met at the mall.

502
00:33:26,666 --> 00:33:28,916
The third time, at the karaoke bar.

503
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,291
That day, we were running around
and met each other, remember?

504
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:35,083
Nope.

505
00:33:35,166 --> 00:33:37,416
Well, it was either Wednesday or Thursday.

506
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,166
There was lightning in the sky, remember?

507
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,541
I don't remember.

508
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:44,083
Whatever. The point is, the baby
in your tummy could be mine.

509
00:33:44,166 --> 00:33:46,083
- It could also be mine.
- It's mine.

510
00:33:46,166 --> 00:33:49,208
- Mine.
- Mine. Because mine was thicker.

511
00:33:51,916 --> 00:33:53,416
We don't have any bad intentions.

512
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,708
Really.

513
00:33:56,375 --> 00:34:00,625
Right, this room seems a little small.

514
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:03,625
Shu Na says she is tired
and she needs some rest.

515
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,875
- Pregnant women need to rest early.
- We are going to rest too.

516
00:34:06,958 --> 00:34:10,416
- Good night.
- Good night.

517
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:13,583
Shu Na.

518
00:34:14,083 --> 00:34:15,666
Let's sleep together.

519
00:34:28,958 --> 00:34:32,791
That's my room.
Why do I have to take the floor?

520
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:34,416
- What's up?
- What do you mean?

521
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,458
The house is mine!
Why can't I sleep on the bed?

522
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:42,250
Fine. The house belongs to Orange.

523
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,250
What now!

524
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:02,750
Now, there's a pregnant woman
in the house.

525
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:05,333
Who will handle the housework?

526
00:35:05,416 --> 00:35:06,916
Simple! I'll do Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday.

527
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,125
Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday are yours.
Sunday we do it together.

528
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:11,500
- What about looking after her?
- That's even simpler!

529
00:35:11,583 --> 00:35:14,875
Whoever is not doing the housework
can look after her.

530
00:35:14,958 --> 00:35:17,708
Okay. I heard that taking a walk
is good for a mother and child.

531
00:35:17,791 --> 00:35:19,583
Who's doing it?

532
00:35:19,666 --> 00:35:21,750
You are so detailed.
Does even this need to be split?

533
00:35:21,833 --> 00:35:23,958
Fine, we'll take turns. I'll go first.

534
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:26,916
- Me first.
- Me first.

535
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:37,125
Xiao Hui, I'm bored.
Come and walk with me.

536
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:40,416
Out the way!

537
00:35:48,458 --> 00:35:50,250
Is the weather too hot for you?

538
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:51,666
A little.

539
00:35:52,541 --> 00:35:53,833
What's wrong?

540
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:56,083
My leg hurts.

541
00:35:56,166 --> 00:35:57,416
It hurts?

542
00:35:59,541 --> 00:36:01,625
Come, let me give you a massage.

543
00:36:01,708 --> 00:36:03,541
It's lucky that I am the one
who came with you.

544
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:06,708
If it had been Mark,
he'd definitely have been panicking.

545
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:13,333
Let me tell you, he may look smart,
but he's actually very dumb.

546
00:36:13,416 --> 00:36:16,583
He always tries to show off.
He's full of nonsense.

547
00:36:16,666 --> 00:36:18,333
- Is he?
- Yes!

548
00:36:18,416 --> 00:36:19,541
I'm his nephew.

549
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:21,333
No one understands him better than me.

550
00:36:21,416 --> 00:36:24,250
I'm his uncle. Of course I know him best.

551
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:26,666
Don't be fooled by his nerdy looks.

552
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:30,583
He's completely different inside,
very scheming!

553
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,416
YOUNG MARK

554
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,000
It's very painful!

555
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:37,791
It's very painful!

556
00:36:37,875 --> 00:36:40,708
YOUNG HUI

557
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:44,375
What's wrong with you?

558
00:36:44,458 --> 00:36:46,541
Can't you see that
I've been stung by a jellyfish?!

559
00:36:46,625 --> 00:36:48,083
Don't worry.

560
00:36:48,666 --> 00:36:49,666
What are you doing?

561
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,833
My mother told me that urine
can cure the poison.

562
00:36:51,916 --> 00:36:53,833
No! Stop!

563
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,125
I didn't want to say this,

564
00:36:57,208 --> 00:37:00,416
but there was once when he peeked at our
neighbor, Flower, while she was bathing.

565
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,250
And he accused me instead.

566
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:04,541
- Did he?
- Of course!

567
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:07,875
He didn't only do that to Flower,
but also to her mother.

568
00:37:07,958 --> 00:37:12,125
And he even did it
to her grandmother once!

569
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:20,625
- Uncle, Uncle, I'm scared.
- What do you want?

570
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:22,458
I will let you peek later
and you won't feel scared.

571
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:25,041
- I don't want to. Please, come down now.
- Be quiet!

572
00:37:25,125 --> 00:37:27,375
What if we get caught by my mother?

573
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:28,708
Be quiet!

574
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:34,000
Young kid!

575
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,541
Who taught you this?!
Peeping at me in the shower!

576
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:38,000
Say something!

577
00:37:39,541 --> 00:37:42,250
No way! I thought he was a good person.

578
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:45,041
You say that because
you are a good person.

579
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,750
Actually,

580
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:52,333
having had such a close friendship
from when you were young,

581
00:37:52,416 --> 00:37:54,333
you really need to treasure each other.

582
00:37:55,875 --> 00:37:57,500
People are afraid of loneliness.

583
00:37:58,583 --> 00:38:00,833
I've been alone since I was young.

584
00:38:02,416 --> 00:38:05,625
I only had this old,
broken doll by my side.

585
00:38:05,708 --> 00:38:08,208
True, we grew up together.

586
00:38:08,291 --> 00:38:10,166
That's how I know him so well.

587
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:14,041
I think from now on you should
lock your door when you sleep.

588
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,125
No, that's not enough.

589
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:18,208
I think you should change the lock.
It would be safer.

590
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:33,416
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

591
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,750
I'm here for the same reason as you are.

592
00:38:36,291 --> 00:38:37,916
Didn't we agree to stop fighting tonight?

593
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,458
- Yes, so let's do this together!
- Okay.

594
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:43,125
Wow.

595
00:38:49,666 --> 00:38:51,458
- Ghost!
- Don't look at me!

596
00:38:57,166 --> 00:38:58,208
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

597
00:38:58,291 --> 00:38:59,791
Come, let's take some pictures.

598
00:39:00,375 --> 00:39:04,083
Me first. Come. One, two, three.

599
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:09,583
Come, me too. One, two, three.

600
00:39:12,875 --> 00:39:14,458
What pose do you like? Cool looks!

601
00:39:14,541 --> 00:39:20,291
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten.

602
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:21,875
Birthday meal!

603
00:39:21,958 --> 00:39:23,541
The dish has a special meaning.

604
00:39:23,625 --> 00:39:25,958
This is a "Happy Meal."

605
00:39:26,041 --> 00:39:29,000
May you and your baby be happy and lively!

606
00:39:29,083 --> 00:39:31,916
Let's eat.

607
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:34,875
Eat after me!

608
00:39:39,166 --> 00:39:40,708
Cheers!

609
00:39:40,791 --> 00:39:42,708
Happy birthday,
and may your wishes come true.

610
00:39:42,791 --> 00:39:45,875
May your baby be as handsome as me.

611
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:48,416
Hey, that's more like a curse!

612
00:39:51,541 --> 00:39:53,291
The baby has to be healthy!

613
00:39:59,916 --> 00:40:04,375
{\an8}SHU NA: I FINALLY HAVE A FAMILY.

614
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:10,375
<i>Hello.</i>

615
00:40:11,708 --> 00:40:12,750
<i>Hello?</i>

616
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,833
<i>Hello.</i>

617
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:23,083
<i>Why aren't you talking?</i>

618
00:40:25,708 --> 00:40:27,125
<i>Is that you? Xiao Na?</i>

619
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,625
Birthday girl, why aren't you in bed yet?

620
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,625
- Are you crying?
- No, I'm just feeling too happy.

621
00:40:38,708 --> 00:40:40,125
- You're crying.
- Too happy?

622
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:46,166
Is this the baby's ultrasound scan image?

623
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,375
That's right.

624
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:49,291
Wow.

625
00:40:49,375 --> 00:40:53,916
It's my first time seeing
the little living thing inside me.

626
00:40:54,666 --> 00:40:56,708
It feels so real.

627
00:40:58,458 --> 00:41:00,041
Which part of the body is this?

628
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:01,583
The head?

629
00:41:01,666 --> 00:41:04,666
- It's her little hand.
- Hand?

630
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:07,875
- That's her head.
- I thought the other side was the head.

631
00:41:09,541 --> 00:41:11,500
A tiny sperm can grow
into such a big living thing.

632
00:41:11,583 --> 00:41:13,333
So amazing!

633
00:41:13,416 --> 00:41:15,666
Stupid! It's a close-up shot!

634
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:18,041
This is amazing.

635
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,500
What?

636
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:22,333
I think you guys are too noisy

637
00:41:22,416 --> 00:41:24,000
- so she kicked me.
- You.

638
00:41:25,208 --> 00:41:26,708
- Right, she kicked me!
- Can I touch it?

639
00:41:26,791 --> 00:41:27,875
Sure.

640
00:41:30,583 --> 00:41:31,791
You can touch and feel it.

641
00:41:31,875 --> 00:41:33,833
She kicked me again.

642
00:41:33,916 --> 00:41:35,458
Smack him!

643
00:41:36,375 --> 00:41:38,166
She kicked me.

644
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:40,916
The baby is amazing.

645
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,583
It's really amazing.

646
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:45,291
Did you see the baby's
head shape is a little sharp?

647
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:46,208
So?

648
00:41:46,291 --> 00:41:49,000
Mother said my head was
the same shape when I was young.

649
00:41:49,083 --> 00:41:52,166
- So?
- So, the baby can be mine!

650
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:55,833
Yeah, but did you feel the power
of the baby's kick?

651
00:41:55,916 --> 00:41:56,958
And?

652
00:41:57,041 --> 00:41:58,583
Mother said my legs were strong
when I was young.

653
00:41:58,666 --> 00:41:59,750
And I kicked well!

654
00:41:59,833 --> 00:42:01,666
So, I can be the father too!

655
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:04,125
Yours is an "if", mine is for sure.

656
00:42:04,208 --> 00:42:05,500
I'm definitely the father.

657
00:42:05,583 --> 00:42:08,333
I'm 100% sure it's mine.

658
00:42:08,416 --> 00:42:09,416
Let's not fight over it now.

659
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,791
Let's wait until the baby is born
and then do a DNA test.

660
00:42:11,875 --> 00:42:13,791
Then you will know I'm the father.

661
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,666
<i>Hello, this is Mark Gao.
I'm busy right now.</i>

662
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:30,333
<i>Please send me a voice message,
SMS, or email.</i>

663
00:42:30,416 --> 00:42:32,416
<i>You can also WhatsApp or WeChat me.</i>

664
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,083
<i>Otherwise, please call me back later.</i>

665
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:50,083
It seems that you haven't
visited for a while.

666
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,583
Why should I?

667
00:42:58,916 --> 00:43:02,416
Don't you feel that I'm the odd one out
among you guys?

668
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:12,166
Actually, I really envy you.

669
00:43:13,916 --> 00:43:15,625
Both of them are crazy about you.

670
00:43:16,458 --> 00:43:17,750
Crazy about me?

671
00:43:18,791 --> 00:43:21,708
Who can guarantee that
they will be crazy about me forever?

672
00:43:23,208 --> 00:43:26,833
That's why I feel that only money

673
00:43:28,583 --> 00:43:30,208
can really be relied on.

674
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:35,291
To have someone totally in love with you
is true happiness.

675
00:43:37,875 --> 00:43:41,916
If you can't even feed yourself,
how can you fall in love?

676
00:43:43,291 --> 00:43:44,750
Whatever it is,

677
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:48,666
you're going to be a mother soon.

678
00:43:50,166 --> 00:43:52,208
A woman needs a child to be a true woman.

679
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:59,625
I can't even find a man
who wants to have a child with me.

680
00:44:04,833 --> 00:44:07,958
A woman needs a child to be a true woman.

681
00:44:14,291 --> 00:44:15,458
Just promise me.

682
00:44:20,041 --> 00:44:21,666
Don't embarrass women.

683
00:44:55,583 --> 00:44:58,166
Why are you here this time?

684
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:01,250
Why are you here then?
I am here for the same reason as you.

685
00:45:03,458 --> 00:45:06,000
Don't tell me you are
still thinking about...

686
00:45:06,083 --> 00:45:07,125
that?

687
00:45:07,625 --> 00:45:08,750
What is "that"?

688
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:10,791
You know, that!

689
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:12,333
Oh, that. No, I'm not thinking
about that anymore.

690
00:45:12,416 --> 00:45:13,416
Then what are you thinking about?

691
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,000
Me? Then what are you thinking about?

692
00:45:16,083 --> 00:45:18,625
I'm wondering if Shu Na
is sleeping well or not.

693
00:45:18,708 --> 00:45:19,833
Exactly.

694
00:45:19,916 --> 00:45:21,458
I'm also wondering the same thing.

695
00:45:21,541 --> 00:45:24,583
- Copycat.
- Why can't I be?

696
00:45:24,666 --> 00:45:29,375
Hey, can you two stop thinking
inside my room?

697
00:45:29,916 --> 00:45:31,375
I'm going to the toilet.

698
00:45:34,958 --> 00:45:36,333
Did she scare you?

699
00:45:36,416 --> 00:45:37,958
No, of course not.

700
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,166
Can you hear that?

701
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:46,416
Even her pee sounds like a melody.

702
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,250
- You are disgusting.
- What?

703
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:52,708
I just feel that she is
not as pretty as before.

704
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:55,125
In fact, she's ugly.

705
00:45:55,208 --> 00:45:57,791
How can you say such a horrible thing?

706
00:45:57,875 --> 00:45:59,708
That's so mean!

707
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:01,208
What I'm saying is,

708
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:05,583
she is willing to sacrifice
her beauty for a child.

709
00:46:06,125 --> 00:46:07,291
She's so wonderful.

710
00:46:08,666 --> 00:46:10,083
I have no idea what you are talking about!

711
00:46:10,166 --> 00:46:12,541
Let's go to bed!
Tomorrow, we have to sell DVDs.

712
00:46:13,375 --> 00:46:17,208
Everyone! Come and take a look.
It's a good deal, three for RM 20.

713
00:46:17,291 --> 00:46:18,666
This is good!
No one is blocking the screen.

714
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:21,250
Even if you don't buy, come and look.
We have everything from 3D to Cat.

715
00:46:21,333 --> 00:46:23,291
Get out, get out of our way.

716
00:46:24,166 --> 00:46:26,000
This is nice.

717
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:28,000
- It's you!
- It's the two of you again?

718
00:46:28,083 --> 00:46:32,625
- Are you here to rob us again?
- Robbery doesn't earn much these days.

719
00:46:32,708 --> 00:46:33,750
I've changed my job.

720
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:36,875
Today, I am here
to help you not be robbed!

721
00:46:37,916 --> 00:46:40,125
- Not be robbed?
- What does that mean?

722
00:46:40,208 --> 00:46:43,791
I'm here to collect money, idiots! Pay up!

723
00:46:43,875 --> 00:46:45,500
- He is so cute.
- He's here to collect money.

724
00:46:45,583 --> 00:46:47,125
You are so cute!

725
00:46:47,208 --> 00:46:51,541
Don't you know we are under Orange,
the queen of pirated DVDs?

726
00:46:51,625 --> 00:46:53,958
Don't you know who Orange is?

727
00:46:54,041 --> 00:46:55,666
Orange. I'm Apple!

728
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:57,208
Or do you prefer soursop?

729
00:46:57,291 --> 00:46:59,583
Let me tell you, there are rumors that

730
00:46:59,666 --> 00:47:02,291
Orange has officially announced that
she has nothing to do with you anymore.

731
00:47:02,375 --> 00:47:03,791
Don't speak Hokkien. I don't understand.

732
00:47:03,875 --> 00:47:06,666
Orange has nothing to do with you anymore.

733
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:08,083
Orange has nothing to do with you anymore.

734
00:47:08,166 --> 00:47:09,166
What is he saying?

735
00:47:12,208 --> 00:47:14,125
Are you acting stupid?
We'll talk in gangster language!

736
00:47:14,208 --> 00:47:16,958
- Beat them up!
- Pay up!

737
00:47:17,041 --> 00:47:19,875
- Pay up!
- Stop it!

738
00:47:19,958 --> 00:47:21,208
Don't get aggressive!

739
00:47:22,458 --> 00:47:24,375
- Orange.
- So powerful.

740
00:47:24,458 --> 00:47:26,375
Well, let's talk. I'm sorry.

741
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:31,375
I did say I had nothing to do with him.

742
00:47:31,458 --> 00:47:34,750
But did I say
you could collect money from him

743
00:47:34,833 --> 00:47:36,458
or that you guys could beat him up?

744
00:47:36,541 --> 00:47:37,833
Nope. We can't.

745
00:47:37,916 --> 00:47:39,083
Another thing.

746
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:42,041
How dare you wear the same outfit as me?

747
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:44,583
No, this is a pussy cat.

748
00:47:44,666 --> 00:47:46,416
What took you so long?

749
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,500
All my things are damaged already.

750
00:47:48,583 --> 00:47:50,916
- Yeah.
- What has it got to do with me?

751
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,416
What has it got to do with you?

752
00:47:53,083 --> 00:47:55,708
From now on, even if you get beaten,
owe people money,

753
00:47:55,791 --> 00:47:57,750
or become a beggar,
I'm not going to help you.

754
00:48:00,208 --> 00:48:02,083
Are you guys leaving without paying
for the damage you did?

755
00:48:02,166 --> 00:48:03,583
Is that how I taught you guys?

756
00:48:03,666 --> 00:48:05,500
Okay, we understand.

757
00:48:06,041 --> 00:48:08,000
- Come, two hundred dollars for you.
- What?

758
00:48:08,083 --> 00:48:10,291
I mean, two thousand.

759
00:48:13,541 --> 00:48:17,708
<i>Looks like Orange will be
disappearing for a while.</i>

760
00:48:17,791 --> 00:48:21,875
<i>But then, someone even
more troublesome came to us.</i>

761
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,083
Mother, what brought you here?

762
00:48:25,166 --> 00:48:28,125
Didn't I WhatsApp you earlier?

763
00:48:28,208 --> 00:48:29,666
- I didn't receive anything.
- No.

764
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:31,208
- I did.
- Nope.

765
00:48:31,291 --> 00:48:32,666
- No?
- Who's at the door?

766
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:35,166
Who is she?

767
00:48:38,083 --> 00:48:40,125
Mark, you are the oldest. You tell me.

768
00:48:40,875 --> 00:48:42,000
She is my friend.

769
00:48:47,041 --> 00:48:50,250
- Correct!
- Friend?

770
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:51,791
Why didn't you tell me that
you were married?

771
00:48:51,875 --> 00:48:54,416
No, she's not Uncle's wife.

772
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,041
Not his wife? Then she is your wife?

773
00:48:56,125 --> 00:48:59,666
No, that's even more unlikely.

774
00:49:00,541 --> 00:49:02,875
Sorry, I need to go and lock up my car.

775
00:49:02,958 --> 00:49:05,125
- I need to go and watch him lock the car.
- You...

776
00:49:06,791 --> 00:49:09,000
Are you coming in?
If not, I'm closing the door.

777
00:49:13,875 --> 00:49:17,875
{\an8}SHU NA: "I'M NOT LETTING ANYONE
DESTROY MY HAPPINESS!"

778
00:49:18,791 --> 00:49:20,875
We just ran out like this.

779
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,416
Are Shu Na and Grandma going to be okay?

780
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:26,208
Don't think like that. Mother has
experienced a lot of things.

781
00:49:26,291 --> 00:49:28,250
Shu Na can pretty much
handle anything too.

782
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:31,500
They are probably
having tea together by now.

783
00:49:36,541 --> 00:49:40,833
Who is the father of the baby?
Mark or Hui?

784
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,125
It's none of your business.

785
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:47,208
If we can't say she is our girlfriend,

786
00:49:47,291 --> 00:49:49,416
shall we say she is
our primary school classmate?

787
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,166
You might as well say
she is a single mother

788
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:53,041
and ditched by the father.
That's too mean!

789
00:49:53,125 --> 00:49:56,125
Don't tell me you were ditched
by some heartless man.

790
00:49:56,208 --> 00:49:58,125
I won't believe that.

791
00:49:58,208 --> 00:50:02,208
And, who is the father of that child?

792
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:05,666
To be honest,

793
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:06,791
I don't know either.

794
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:11,333
Let's just be honest with Grandma
and say that we sold our sperm.

795
00:50:11,416 --> 00:50:12,791
Mother is very conservative.

796
00:50:12,875 --> 00:50:14,250
She will get a heart attack from this.

797
00:50:14,333 --> 00:50:18,541
I thought you had a good new idea
since you raised your voice,

798
00:50:18,625 --> 00:50:20,500
but it turned out to be useless.

799
00:50:20,583 --> 00:50:21,875
Why don't you think of something?

800
00:50:21,958 --> 00:50:25,166
Although this squid is only so-so quality,

801
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:29,416
it doesn't seem like he'll lose his mind
when he is drunk.

802
00:50:31,708 --> 00:50:34,208
This is even fresher and greener.

803
00:50:35,083 --> 00:50:37,083
Such a pity

804
00:50:37,166 --> 00:50:39,208
that it has been ruined this way.

805
00:50:39,833 --> 00:50:42,375
If you don't like me,
you can go back to your own place.

806
00:50:42,458 --> 00:50:43,791
Why are you still here?

807
00:50:45,791 --> 00:50:49,000
I'm deaf. I can't hear you properly.

808
00:50:57,208 --> 00:50:59,291
So, any ideas?
How are we going to explain it to Mother?

809
00:50:59,375 --> 00:51:00,833
You think of something.

810
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
She left.

811
00:51:13,125 --> 00:51:15,083
- Shu Na.
- Shu Na.

812
00:51:15,166 --> 00:51:17,375
- Chicken soup, good stuff.
- Good stuff.

813
00:51:18,041 --> 00:51:19,083
Come quickly.

814
00:51:19,625 --> 00:51:20,541
Go away.

815
00:51:20,625 --> 00:51:21,958
Use this for her. That's yours.

816
00:51:22,041 --> 00:51:23,416
It's the same.

817
00:51:24,625 --> 00:51:26,125
Sit down.

818
00:51:27,625 --> 00:51:29,333
Drink while it's hot. It's nice.

819
00:51:29,416 --> 00:51:31,125
Grandma spent so much time on this.

820
00:51:31,208 --> 00:51:32,708
Chicken soup?

821
00:51:33,666 --> 00:51:34,916
Let's eat.

822
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,625
How is it?

823
00:51:38,458 --> 00:51:40,291
It must be good.

824
00:51:44,833 --> 00:51:45,666
What's wrong?

825
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:48,291
What's wrong?

826
00:51:50,916 --> 00:51:53,333
Grandma, what did you put
in the chicken soup?

827
00:51:53,416 --> 00:51:56,750
Mother, even if you don't like her,
you don't have to do this.

828
00:51:56,833 --> 00:51:59,833
What are you two talking about?
Who dislikes who?

829
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,708
I bought some pork belly
and some Chinese herbs.

830
00:52:23,791 --> 00:52:27,708
You can take a look and check
if you are okay.

831
00:52:27,791 --> 00:52:30,375
I will use them to make some soup for you.

832
00:52:30,458 --> 00:52:34,125
It will be good for the baby.

833
00:52:34,208 --> 00:52:37,541
It's better for you to check first. I
don't want to be accused of poisoning you.

834
00:52:37,625 --> 00:52:40,333
Why? Are you feeling guilty now?

835
00:52:40,416 --> 00:52:43,000
Don't you like asking me
who the father of the baby is?

836
00:52:43,083 --> 00:52:47,000
You think I am senile or something?

837
00:52:47,666 --> 00:52:51,250
When the baby is born,
we can do a DNA check.

838
00:52:51,333 --> 00:52:54,166
Then we'll know who the father is.

839
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:57,166
I'll still love the child
no matter who the father is.

840
00:52:57,250 --> 00:53:01,416
Whether it belongs to Mark or Hui,
it's still going to be my grandchild.

841
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:16,583
Come with me!

842
00:53:17,083 --> 00:53:18,333
Let me go!

843
00:53:18,416 --> 00:53:19,500
What are you doing?

844
00:53:19,583 --> 00:53:22,000
What do you want?

845
00:53:27,958 --> 00:53:29,208
Don't be scared.

846
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:32,833
Let's go!

847
00:53:34,458 --> 00:53:35,583
How dare you run?!

848
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,875
Luckily, we could get away like this.

849
00:54:09,166 --> 00:54:10,791
Are you okay?

850
00:54:10,875 --> 00:54:13,500
- I am okay.
- Good.

851
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:14,875
Be careful.

852
00:54:15,458 --> 00:54:18,041
Look ahead. Walk slowly.

853
00:54:33,458 --> 00:54:34,875
What's the matter?

854
00:54:34,958 --> 00:54:37,083
I think I've got a cramp in my leg.

855
00:54:37,166 --> 00:54:38,916
Bear with me.

856
00:54:43,291 --> 00:54:44,541
Are you feeling better?

857
00:54:45,875 --> 00:54:46,833
Grandma.

858
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:50,458
I'm sorry.

859
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:59,291
I had been mean to you
and you still protected me earlier.

860
00:55:03,958 --> 00:55:06,458
I think you are a decent girl.

861
00:55:07,625 --> 00:55:10,458
Look at you.
I'm sure you have suffered a lot.

862
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:15,916
Why are those people after you?

863
00:55:18,583 --> 00:55:22,291
I had a hard life as a child.

864
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:27,250
I used to look at those rich people,
showing off

865
00:55:27,333 --> 00:55:29,416
and always getting what they wanted.

866
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:35,333
I promised myself that I would marry
a rich man when I grew up.

867
00:55:35,416 --> 00:55:40,208
Why did a nice girl like you
put yourself through that?

868
00:55:40,291 --> 00:55:44,083
Grandma, I didn't mean
to trouble Mark or Hui.

869
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:48,791
It's all because that woman
tries everything to hurt me.

870
00:55:48,875 --> 00:55:50,958
She's the one who cannot give birth,

871
00:55:51,041 --> 00:55:53,208
and I am the one who carries
her husband's baby.

872
00:55:53,291 --> 00:55:55,291
She comes and attacks me.

873
00:55:55,833 --> 00:55:57,666
I really had no choice,
so I ended up here.

874
00:55:57,750 --> 00:56:00,375
Enough. I understand now.

875
00:56:09,125 --> 00:56:10,958
Grandma, wait over there.

876
00:56:14,625 --> 00:56:15,875
Hello?

877
00:56:20,833 --> 00:56:22,125
What?

878
00:56:22,833 --> 00:56:24,125
Say that again!

879
00:56:26,083 --> 00:56:27,833
How can you do that to me?!

880
00:56:27,916 --> 00:56:29,708
Do you know how much
I have given in for you?

881
00:56:33,125 --> 00:56:36,333
- What are you doing?
- I don't want this child anymore!

882
00:56:36,416 --> 00:56:39,208
Stop! You can't do this!

883
00:56:41,625 --> 00:56:44,166
Her water broke!

884
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:47,541
Help! Hospital!

885
00:56:54,125 --> 00:56:55,625
I'm going to a father!

886
00:56:55,708 --> 00:56:57,125
It's me who's going to be a father.

887
00:56:57,833 --> 00:57:00,583
- It's me!
- It's me!

888
00:57:00,666 --> 00:57:03,333
- Come!
- Grandma! How is it?

889
00:57:03,416 --> 00:57:04,625
The baby is coming out.

890
00:57:04,708 --> 00:57:06,208
Why did Shu Na suddenly go into labor?

891
00:57:06,291 --> 00:57:09,166
Mother, don't tell me
you did something to her again.

892
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:11,958
Scoundrel! Blaming everything on me again?

893
00:57:12,041 --> 00:57:15,625
She answered a call
and her water broke, and we're here.

894
00:57:15,708 --> 00:57:18,083
Wow! What a powerful call!

895
00:57:18,166 --> 00:57:21,041
Grandma, I heard that it's tough for
a first-time mom to go into labor.

896
00:57:21,125 --> 00:57:22,583
Does it hurt?

897
00:57:22,666 --> 00:57:28,333
Oh, my little Hui has finally grown up.

898
00:57:28,416 --> 00:57:31,000
Now, you know how to be considerate.
Good boy.

899
00:57:31,083 --> 00:57:33,500
Grandma, this is not
the right time to tease me.

900
00:57:37,083 --> 00:57:38,833
It's Orange.

901
00:57:38,916 --> 00:57:39,791
Orange?

902
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:44,291
Cheap woman!

903
00:57:44,375 --> 00:57:48,875
You told everyone that we have broken up,
but you have been following me around.

904
00:57:48,958 --> 00:57:50,125
His ex-girlfriend.

905
00:57:50,208 --> 00:57:51,708
Who is following you?

906
00:57:51,791 --> 00:57:54,541
You, obviously! Otherwise,
why are you here at the hospital?

907
00:57:54,625 --> 00:57:56,875
Do you own this hospital?
Why can't I be here while you can?

908
00:57:56,958 --> 00:57:59,458
I came here to be a dad today.

909
00:57:59,541 --> 00:58:01,708
I came here to be a mother today.

910
00:58:01,791 --> 00:58:03,166
To be a mother?

911
00:58:03,833 --> 00:58:05,000
Are you pregnant?

912
00:58:07,916 --> 00:58:09,375
Why?

913
00:58:09,458 --> 00:58:11,541
- Why can't I be pregnant?
- Of course you can have a baby.

914
00:58:11,625 --> 00:58:15,083
As many as you want. You can have a
dolphin, a shark, anything you wish.

915
00:58:15,916 --> 00:58:17,833
Ouch! It hurts!

916
00:58:20,708 --> 00:58:23,875
- Don't think I am unwanted.
- Of course not.

917
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:27,083
They will travel by yacht, taxi, and bus,
just to come and have you.

918
00:58:27,166 --> 00:58:29,458
They will even line up for you. Ouch!

919
00:58:30,291 --> 00:58:33,000
It hurts! Can you let go now?

920
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:43,000
Orange said she's pregnant.

921
00:58:43,083 --> 00:58:44,666
Your girlfriend is good for you!

922
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:46,416
- She's so cool!
- Yes, a good match for you.

923
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:47,791
What? You both like her?

924
00:58:47,875 --> 00:58:49,708
- Then you should marry her.
- No way!

925
00:58:49,791 --> 00:58:51,916
Either his arms
or his legs would be broken.

926
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,625
- He still has his head.
- No! That one is for me!

927
00:58:56,875 --> 00:58:58,083
Doctor.

928
00:58:58,166 --> 00:59:00,416
Is it a fried cake of fried sticks
(Is it a girl or a boy)?

929
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,708
Is it in one piece or one stick?

930
00:59:06,416 --> 00:59:07,750
Abalone (Girl).

931
00:59:08,958 --> 00:59:13,083
Great! It's worth some money!

932
00:59:13,166 --> 00:59:15,875
It's lucky that it's not clams.

933
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:25,458
OUR CUTE LITTLE HONEY!

934
00:59:27,208 --> 00:59:29,250
Look at Honey.

935
00:59:29,333 --> 00:59:31,833
I'm sure she is going to be a supermodel
when she grows up.

936
00:59:31,916 --> 00:59:34,250
Look at her long arms and legs,
she looks like me! Right?

937
00:59:34,333 --> 00:59:37,000
If she looks like you,
then she'd look like a drag queen.

938
00:59:37,083 --> 00:59:38,500
She looks like me more, right? Honey?

939
00:59:38,583 --> 00:59:40,750
Don't speak nonsense in front of the baby.

940
00:59:40,833 --> 00:59:42,250
Looks like you? Her skin will be so dry.

941
00:59:42,333 --> 00:59:44,166
Look! Even she is objecting!

942
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:45,916
Flat chest!

943
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:50,375
Honey doesn't look like either of us.
She looks like her mother, right?

944
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:12,125
- Hello?
<i>- Bitch!</i>

945
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:15,166
<i>I checked and found out that
you had miscarried our baby</i>

946
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:17,583
<i>and then went for artificial insemination.</i>

947
01:00:17,666 --> 01:00:19,083
<i>Are you trying to make a fool of me?</i>

948
01:00:19,166 --> 01:00:21,833
<i>Let me tell you, you won't get
a single cent from me!</i>

949
01:00:21,916 --> 01:00:24,125
What? Say that again!

950
01:00:24,208 --> 01:00:25,833
How can you do that to me?

951
01:00:25,916 --> 01:00:27,750
Do you know how much
I have given in for you?

952
01:00:48,291 --> 01:00:49,833
Guys, your voices are so unbearable.

953
01:00:49,916 --> 01:00:51,500
- It's you!
- You made her cry.

954
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:54,250
Honey, let Grandma feed you, okay?

955
01:00:55,916 --> 01:00:59,583
Honey, how can you be so cute?

956
01:01:00,916 --> 01:01:02,208
Honey, smile!

957
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,833
To change diapers, open up the legs.

958
01:01:19,916 --> 01:01:26,666
You wrap this up,
slip it under this side, wrap tightly,

959
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:29,291
and secure it when the safety pin.

960
01:01:31,166 --> 01:01:32,375
- Are you nuts?
- Mother,

961
01:01:32,458 --> 01:01:34,166
I'm worried that you might hurt her.
It looks painful!

962
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:35,750
If you are so good, you do it!

963
01:01:40,625 --> 01:01:43,750
You can't see me.

964
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:47,375
Open the legs, and then fold this up.

965
01:01:47,458 --> 01:01:50,583
Pull this from the right,
and then from the left.

966
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:51,916
Done!

967
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:56,625
How smart! Everything comes out!

968
01:01:56,708 --> 01:01:58,000
Smelly!

969
01:01:58,708 --> 01:02:01,041
Honey looks like me, she's so cute!

970
01:02:03,458 --> 01:02:06,125
Enough. Stop playing with her,
come and eat.

971
01:02:06,208 --> 01:02:09,875
Honey, let's go and eat.

972
01:02:09,958 --> 01:02:12,333
What a luxury meal!

973
01:02:12,416 --> 01:02:15,125
Of course! It's Honey's baby shower today.

974
01:02:15,208 --> 01:02:17,250
A good day for me, as a grandma.

975
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:19,208
She's so cute!

976
01:02:19,291 --> 01:02:20,833
Our little Honey is the prettiest baby.

977
01:02:20,916 --> 01:02:23,500
Honey looks like her mother.

978
01:03:12,458 --> 01:03:14,208
Honey is a month old now.

979
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:16,666
It's time for me to leave.

980
01:03:18,166 --> 01:03:19,708
Grandma.

981
01:03:22,583 --> 01:03:24,375
I know this is not easy for you.

982
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:27,333
But you should do your best
to bring up your daughter.

983
01:03:29,833 --> 01:03:31,625
I believe you can do it.

984
01:03:40,041 --> 01:03:46,416
Although this is not an expensive pendant,

985
01:03:47,375 --> 01:03:49,500
it has been with me for many years.

986
01:03:50,708 --> 01:03:52,791
Let's give this to Honey.

987
01:03:52,875 --> 01:03:55,458
Hopefully, it will bless her
with good fortune.

988
01:03:55,541 --> 01:03:56,791
Grandma.

989
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:03,291
I may not know
what really happened to you,

990
01:04:04,583 --> 01:04:09,416
but your daughter is definitely
your new future.

991
01:04:10,166 --> 01:04:11,791
A new beginning.

992
01:04:15,375 --> 01:04:17,291
You should cherish it.

993
01:04:43,375 --> 01:04:48,291
{\an8}SHU NA: WHY DO MOTHERS ALWAYS
CHOOSE TO LEAVE?

994
01:05:09,875 --> 01:05:10,916
Hello?

995
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,083
Hello?

996
01:05:17,083 --> 01:05:18,375
<i>Hello?</i>

997
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:21,791
Is that you, Xiao Na?

998
01:05:25,208 --> 01:05:26,500
Xiao Na.

999
01:05:29,333 --> 01:05:30,791
<i>Mother knows it's you.</i>

1000
01:05:33,458 --> 01:05:35,208
Why aren't you saying anything?

1001
01:05:35,291 --> 01:05:36,458
Xiao Na?

1002
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:40,750
<i>Hello?</i>

1003
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:24,333
Hello, Producer Jiang.

1004
01:06:24,416 --> 01:06:27,166
How are you? Yes. I am Shu Na.

1005
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:28,333
Not Shu Qi.

1006
01:06:28,416 --> 01:06:30,708
Is it? Mr. Yang.
No problem, whatever you say.

1007
01:06:30,791 --> 01:06:32,416
I heard that you are starting a new film.

1008
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:34,125
Jumping off buildings, jumping off trains,
being a stunt double.

1009
01:06:34,208 --> 01:06:37,208
Hello, Director Neo.
A prostitute, gigolo, I can even go nude!

1010
01:06:37,291 --> 01:06:38,583
Right. I'm Shu...

1011
01:06:38,666 --> 01:06:40,166
Basically, I would like to...

1012
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:52,916
Hello, Director Fung.

1013
01:06:56,041 --> 01:06:57,333
Audition?

1014
01:07:12,166 --> 01:07:15,958
JOINT ACCOUNT: SHU NA, GAO XIAO HUI

1015
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:22,625
JOINT ACCOUNT: SHU NA, GAO DA WEI

1016
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:42,583
<i>I would like to withdraw
all the money from these two accounts.</i>

1017
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:33,791
Honey.

1018
01:08:34,583 --> 01:08:36,500
My little dear darling.

1019
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:45,625
Your life will be full of happiness
with your two daddies.

1020
01:08:47,125 --> 01:08:50,333
And Grandma. She will love you a lot too.

1021
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:57,166
Now, Mommy has an opportunity.

1022
01:08:59,416 --> 01:09:01,541
And I can't let it pass by.

1023
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:08,291
Actually, I don't want
to leave you either.

1024
01:09:10,625 --> 01:09:12,791
But I have no other choice.

1025
01:09:17,208 --> 01:09:18,958
When you grow up,

1026
01:09:19,041 --> 01:09:20,875
please don't hate Mommy.

1027
01:09:22,583 --> 01:09:24,333
You will understand me.

1028
01:10:06,583 --> 01:10:08,916
It's lucky that I'm so handsome.

1029
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,375
Otherwise, we wouldn't be getting
such a good deal.

1030
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:19,958
- I'm leaving.
- For where?

1031
01:10:20,041 --> 01:10:21,583
I'm going to Shanghai for an audition.

1032
01:10:21,666 --> 01:10:24,208
If I make it, I won't be back for a while.

1033
01:10:24,291 --> 01:10:26,708
You are a mother now.
Why are you still filming?

1034
01:10:26,791 --> 01:10:28,416
You should concentrate on
bringing up your daughter.

1035
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:29,958
Yes. Are you short of money?

1036
01:10:30,041 --> 01:10:32,875
- You can tell me.
- I am leaving Honey with you guys.

1037
01:10:32,958 --> 01:10:35,333
Honey is your daughter!

1038
01:10:35,416 --> 01:10:38,458
- What are you doing?
- I don't want you to leave.

1039
01:10:40,416 --> 01:10:43,458
- I don't want you to leave!
- I want to go!

1040
01:10:43,541 --> 01:10:45,666
- I don't want you to leave!
- No!

1041
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:47,833
- Get out!
- Bitch!

1042
01:10:47,916 --> 01:10:50,500
- I won't let you leave!
- I want to leave!

1043
01:10:50,583 --> 01:10:52,500
Honey needs a mother!

1044
01:10:53,125 --> 01:10:55,333
Honey is good having
you two as her fathers.

1045
01:10:55,416 --> 01:10:57,708
- Then what about me?
- And me?

1046
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:59,208
Where's my bag?

1047
01:11:00,125 --> 01:11:02,041
- Give it back to me!
- You can't go!

1048
01:11:02,125 --> 01:11:04,166
- You can't go!
- Give it back to me!

1049
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:05,791
You can't leave!

1050
01:11:10,416 --> 01:11:12,583
We have been doing good as a family.

1051
01:11:12,666 --> 01:11:14,166
Why are you tearing this family apart?

1052
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:15,875
Right, it's painful!

1053
01:11:15,958 --> 01:11:18,458
I don't have a family.
I've never had a family.

1054
01:11:18,541 --> 01:11:21,041
Never! This is not my family either!

1055
01:11:21,125 --> 01:11:22,750
This is not my family!

1056
01:11:44,125 --> 01:11:45,708
You can't leave.

1057
01:11:45,791 --> 01:11:47,666
We really need you.

1058
01:11:51,666 --> 01:11:54,125
You're nuts! What kind of mother are you?

1059
01:11:56,291 --> 01:11:58,250
Can you really just leave us like this?

1060
01:12:04,666 --> 01:12:06,250
I'm sorry.

1061
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:13,541
The little girl has a temperature
of 39 degrees.

1062
01:12:13,625 --> 01:12:16,500
It could be dengue or meningitis.

1063
01:12:16,583 --> 01:12:18,458
The doctor says she has to be
put under observation

1064
01:12:18,541 --> 01:12:20,833
before we can tell you her condition.

1065
01:12:20,916 --> 01:12:23,250
Which one of you is her father?

1066
01:12:23,333 --> 01:12:24,750
- I am!
- I am!

1067
01:12:24,833 --> 01:12:26,000
- I am!
- I am!

1068
01:12:28,125 --> 01:12:29,833
I'll call you again later.

1069
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,375
Thank you.

1070
01:12:39,833 --> 01:12:41,625
- Actually, Honey is my daughter.
- Actually, Honey is my daughter.

1071
01:12:41,708 --> 01:12:43,083
She's my daughter.

1072
01:12:43,166 --> 01:12:45,333
- Honey is my daughter.
- She's mine.

1073
01:12:45,416 --> 01:12:47,625
You listen to me. Honey is my daughter.

1074
01:12:47,708 --> 01:12:50,416
That's impossible. Shu Na told me herself.

1075
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:53,500
Shu Na also told me herself.

1076
01:12:57,916 --> 01:13:01,125
Handsome, it's been a while
since we last sang together.

1077
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:05,916
<i>Who has the charm? Who is exuding heat?</i>

1078
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,625
<i>My heart begins to miss you</i>

1079
01:13:14,166 --> 01:13:17,791
I think Honey needs a father.

1080
01:13:18,416 --> 01:13:20,125
I've done the DNA test.

1081
01:13:20,708 --> 01:13:24,291
Apparently, Honey is your daughter.

1082
01:13:27,791 --> 01:13:30,083
I have a daughter! Honey is my daughter!

1083
01:13:30,166 --> 01:13:31,958
- Is Honey really my daughter?
- Yes!

1084
01:13:32,041 --> 01:13:35,500
We need to celebrate! Cheers!

1085
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:42,041
Yeah! We can live happily as a family now!

1086
01:13:42,583 --> 01:13:45,791
"But you have to promise me,
do not say this to Hui."

1087
01:13:45,875 --> 01:13:47,625
"I'm worried that he will get upset."

1088
01:13:47,708 --> 01:13:51,125
- "You know how vulnerable he is!"
- "You know how childish he is!"

1089
01:13:51,208 --> 01:13:53,416
"Men are usually not good
at managing their money."

1090
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:55,125
"Poor money management skills."

1091
01:13:55,208 --> 01:13:56,958
"For the benefit of our family..."

1092
01:13:57,041 --> 01:14:00,416
- "Let's have a family financial plan!"
- "Let's have a family financial plan!"

1093
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:03,083
- You've opened a bank account too?
- You've opened a bank account too?

1094
01:14:06,083 --> 01:14:12,791
I bet our accounts now have zero balance.

1095
01:14:12,875 --> 01:14:15,291
It took me a long time
to save up that RM 40,000.

1096
01:14:16,083 --> 01:14:20,125
I can't believe that
we have both been cheated.

1097
01:14:20,208 --> 01:14:21,708
You're an idiot!

1098
01:14:52,958 --> 01:14:54,708
Driver, can you please
pull over for a while?

1099
01:16:12,041 --> 01:16:13,125
Xiao Na.

1100
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:17,416
Mommy is leaving.

1101
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,958
There are many brothers and sisters
who play with you here.

1102
01:16:29,166 --> 01:16:30,916
Take good care of yourself.

1103
01:16:32,875 --> 01:16:35,250
Mommy, take me with you.

1104
01:16:35,333 --> 01:16:36,500
Xiao Na.

1105
01:16:37,625 --> 01:16:39,541
Our family is too poor.

1106
01:16:40,166 --> 01:16:41,916
I can't bear it anymore.

1107
01:16:42,666 --> 01:16:44,666
Now, Mommy has an opportunity.

1108
01:16:45,541 --> 01:16:47,208
And I can't let it pass by.

1109
01:16:48,791 --> 01:16:50,791
Mommy loves you.

1110
01:16:51,875 --> 01:16:53,708
But I don't have a choice.

1111
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,791
Please, don't blame me for this.

1112
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:02,333
When you grow up,

1113
01:17:03,291 --> 01:17:04,750
you will understand.

1114
01:17:06,916 --> 01:17:07,958
I love you.

1115
01:17:48,833 --> 01:17:50,833
<i>Honey's fever has subsided.</i>

1116
01:17:50,916 --> 01:17:53,666
It's fortunate that
it's not meningitis nor dengue fever.

1117
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:57,458
I wonder if Shu Na's flight
has departed yet.

1118
01:17:57,541 --> 01:17:59,375
Why did you bring up that woman?

1119
01:17:59,458 --> 01:18:03,458
Don't be like that.
After all, she is Honey's mother.

1120
01:18:03,541 --> 01:18:06,458
Let me ask you, have you slept with her?

1121
01:18:06,541 --> 01:18:08,125
I did...

1122
01:18:08,208 --> 01:18:09,708
I thought about it.

1123
01:18:11,125 --> 01:18:13,250
Let me tell you, from today,

1124
01:18:13,333 --> 01:18:17,041
Honey should be the only woman
you can think about.

1125
01:18:17,125 --> 01:18:18,791
- We have to take good care of her.
- Sure.

1126
01:18:18,875 --> 01:18:21,708
I'll be the father. You can be the mother.

1127
01:18:21,791 --> 01:18:25,375
Why can't I be the father
and you be the mother?

1128
01:18:25,458 --> 01:18:30,500
The muscle that you've built up from
your workout makes you look like a mother.

1129
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:33,833
And, don't be lazy.

1130
01:18:33,916 --> 01:18:36,500
We need to make lots of money.

1131
01:18:36,583 --> 01:18:42,250
For Honey to do her bachelor's degree,
master's, and PhD.

1132
01:18:42,333 --> 01:18:43,791
Let her study all she wants.

1133
01:18:43,875 --> 01:18:48,000
And make her our country's first-ever
lady prime minister!

1134
01:18:48,083 --> 01:18:51,500
- First lady prime minister?
- Yeah. Lady prime minister.

1135
01:18:51,583 --> 01:18:53,583
You're the lady prime minister.

1136
01:19:11,916 --> 01:19:12,958
<i>Xiao Na.</i>

1137
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:15,416
<i>I know you are there.</i>

1138
01:19:18,791 --> 01:19:21,916
I also know that you have called before.

1139
01:19:24,125 --> 01:19:25,250
Xiao Na.

1140
01:19:27,250 --> 01:19:29,000
Why are you keeping quiet?

1141
01:19:33,208 --> 01:19:37,125
<i>It's really cold here.</i>

1142
01:19:41,166 --> 01:19:43,083
I feel really lonely.

1143
01:19:46,375 --> 01:19:47,958
<i>I shouldn't have just left.</i>

1144
01:19:50,625 --> 01:19:52,125
<i>Xiao Na.</i>

1145
01:19:54,875 --> 01:19:56,916
Please forgive Mommy. Please?

1146
01:20:03,416 --> 01:20:04,666
<i>Xiao Na.</i>

1147
01:20:06,541 --> 01:20:08,750
<i>Can you please say something
to me, please?</i>

1148
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:12,875
Hello?

1149
01:20:13,916 --> 01:20:15,416
I'm hanging up.

1150
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Careful.

1151
01:20:32,916 --> 01:20:34,666
Honey!

1152
01:21:06,166 --> 01:21:11,333
SHU NA: MOM, I'VE DONE
WHAT YOU COULDN'T.

1153
01:21:30,750 --> 01:21:34,500
<i>Mom, this is your granddaughter, Honey.</i>

1154
01:21:37,458 --> 01:21:40,416
<i>After two years, Shu Na is back
in the movie industry.</i>

1155
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:43,875
<i>With her Stunning performance
in the movie</i> Paper Sun,

1156
01:21:43,958 --> 01:21:46,875
<i>- she has won the Best Newcomer award...</i>
- Honey look! Mommy won an award!

1157
01:21:46,958 --> 01:21:49,375
Quickly, clap your hands.

1158
01:21:49,458 --> 01:21:52,583
<i>Winning this award was possible</i>

1159
01:21:52,666 --> 01:21:57,125
<i>because of my hard work
and the support of my fans.</i>

1160
01:21:57,208 --> 01:22:01,833
<i>But there are two people
I need to thank the most.</i>

1161
01:22:01,916 --> 01:22:06,250
<i>Without them, I can tell you that
I wouldn't have been able to win this.</i>

1162
01:22:07,916 --> 01:22:09,583
Good girl, Honey.

1163
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:15,916
Mark Gao!

1164
01:22:17,250 --> 01:22:18,333
Mark Gao!

1165
01:22:20,208 --> 01:22:23,666
Ah, hi. Long time no see.

1166
01:22:23,750 --> 01:22:26,166
- Long time no see. How are you?
- I'm good, and you?

1167
01:22:26,250 --> 01:22:29,250
- I'm good, and you?
- I'm good too.

1168
01:22:29,333 --> 01:22:32,250
Since we are both good, goodbye!

1169
01:22:38,041 --> 01:22:39,791
- Let's get married.
- What?

1170
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:46,000
I conducted a DNA test.

1171
01:22:46,083 --> 01:22:47,250
Apparently,

1172
01:22:48,625 --> 01:22:50,125
my baby is yours.

1173
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,625
Ma'am, are you crazy or something?

1174
01:22:55,416 --> 01:22:59,333
The other day you shouted that if I could
be a father, you could be a mother.

1175
01:22:59,416 --> 01:23:01,125
That you were not unwanted!

1176
01:23:02,458 --> 01:23:05,500
You must have been dumped by someone else,
so you now you are here to look for me.

1177
01:23:05,583 --> 01:23:07,916
Actually, I didn't hook up
with another guy.

1178
01:23:08,666 --> 01:23:10,708
I only went for artificial insemination.

1179
01:23:11,708 --> 01:23:15,208
Coincidentally, I got your semen.

1180
01:23:15,291 --> 01:23:17,583
Don't you think this is our destiny?

1181
01:23:18,666 --> 01:23:21,458
Wow, look at the baby!

1182
01:23:21,541 --> 01:23:23,125
- Yes!
- She's so cute and she looks like you!

1183
01:23:23,208 --> 01:23:25,541
Quick, call Daddy. Mark Gao!

1184
01:23:27,875 --> 01:23:31,041
Mark Gao! The baby needs a father!

1185
01:23:31,125 --> 01:23:35,291
Who is the idiot who invented
artificial insemination?

1186
01:23:35,375 --> 01:23:38,000
I'm going to kill him!
