1
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,880
During the midst of Ming Dynasty,
wicked Jia Shoudao

2
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,640
the Prime Minister, tried to
dupe the young emperor.

3
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,440
Using his rank and power
he oppressed the people.

4
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,240
Imperial Academy's senior lecturer
Song Yuan rebelled.

5
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,160
He tried to expose Jia's crafty plans.

6
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,640
The wicked Prime Minister

7
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,560
is furious with Song's actions.

8
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,320
He arrested Song,
and tortures him in prison.

9
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,640
He hopes to get rid of Song.

10
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,520
Look.

11
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,040
Are you alright?

12
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,400
I'm fine, just slightly painful...

13
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,080
Sit down, have a rest.

14
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,120
Thank you, Your Majesty.

15
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,920
Come here...

16
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,280
Head of Punishments Geng Shangde
requests your audience

17
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,880
Why are you here?
His Majesty hasn't summoned you.

18
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,720
Send the prime minister here.

19
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,760
Yes.

20
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,440
Geng Shangde greets Your Majesty.

21
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,080
Stand.

22
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,040
Thank you, Your Majesty.

23
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,840
What do you have to say?

24
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,520
Your Majesty, Song Yuan

25
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,520
has been arrested this morning.

26
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,360
Did you order the arrest, Your Majesty?

27
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,280
Yes, I did.

28
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,920
What crime has he committed?

29
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,240
Song Yuan is too strict as my teacher.

30
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,560
Song Yuan is...

31
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,960
too strict as my teacher.

32
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,560
too strict as my teacher.

33
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,840
And he's offended His Majesty.

34
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,960
Song Yuan as the emperor's teacher.

35
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,360
Out of court they are
teacher and student in the study.

36
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,160
It's the teacher's fault
if he isn't strict.

37
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,200
It's the teacher's duty.

38
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,320
I hope Your Majesty will
pay no attention to slander.

39
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,040
Pardon him and free him.

40
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,280
I know what you're saying.

41
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,160
Not only that Song Yuan has offended me,

42
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,440
he's also been
communicating with our enemy.

43
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,920
Communicating with our enemy?

44
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,480
Is there proof for that?

45
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,880
The Prime Minister once went hunting
at the outskirts,

46
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,080
and he captured a spy of the enemy.

47
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,800
Under interrogation, the spy confessed

48
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,960
that he's here to deliver a letter
to Song Yuan.

49
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,920
Where's the spy then?

50
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,800
He died after the torture.

51
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,680
What about the letter?

52
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,880
It's being burnt.

53
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,960
Without witness or proof,
it's obvious that

54
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,880
an evil official is trying to frame
a loyal man.

55
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,760
I beg that Your Majesty pardon him
as a favour.

56
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,080
Song Yuan deserves to be locked up.

57
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,240
There's no need for you to
meddle in others' business.

58
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,320
I'm the Head of Punishments.

59
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,880
It's my duty to make sure
we lock up the right people.

60
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,840
Are you trying to disobey my order?

61
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,480
I dare not.

62
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,760
Official Geng, how did it go?

63
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,760
The wicked Jia Shoudao framed your father,

64
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,720
but I've thought up a solution.

65
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,320
Your father contributed to the nation
back then,

66
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,120
the late emperor rewarded him
an iron shield of pardon.

67
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,000
With it, he'd be spared
even after committing a felony.

68
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,360
I don't know what's wrong with me lately;

69
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,760
If Official Geng hadn't brought it up,

70
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,560
I'd already have forgotten
about the iron shield.

71
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,800
We should head back home right away,

72
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,000
get the iron shield and save my father.

73
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,280
I just worry that
we're running out of time.

74
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,440
Cousin Shikai.

75
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,800
I'll go with my mother
to pick up the shield,

76
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,520
you and Official Geng
head to the capital first.

77
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,920
It'd be better if we do it like this.

78
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,840
Very well! You must hurry.

79
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,920
Jia Shoudao is determined to
bring your father down.

80
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,800
We must be extra careful on the road.

81
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,400
Yes. I think

82
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,200
not only that we need to be in disguise,

83
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,560
but we must also hide

84
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,240
the iron shield well.

85
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,200
Yes.

86
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,640
Where should we hide it then?

87
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,200
Prime Minister, you're very smart.

88
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,680
I'm really impressed.

89
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,400
It's just a small trick.

90
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,560
Last time I told you

91
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,880
to take care of Song Yuan's business.

92
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,320
When are you leaving?

93
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,880
I'll leave tomorrow.

94
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,160
This is highly confidential,
you must keep this secret.

95
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,240
As long as Song Yuan's dead,

96
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,440
then I'll have no more worries.

97
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,240
I admire your plan, sir.

98
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,280
Jia Shoudao.

99
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,000
Who are you?

100
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,000
Jin Shikai.

101
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,480
Nephew of Song Yuan.

102
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,680
He's family of the rebel, catch him!

103
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,720
Yes.

104
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,680
The heavens wouldn't let you frame
a loyal man.

105
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,520
Till the next time we meet.

106
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,040
Please forgive me, I failed to catch him.

107
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,760
He's escaped,
I fear that he'll spread the news.

108
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,640
Get changed right away,

109
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,400
head for Song Yuan's home town,
act accordingly.

110
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,400
Yes, Prime Minister.

111
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,680
Go!

112
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,640
No one's here.

113
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,600
They can't be gone far.

114
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,880
We can catch up on horseback.

115
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,240
Turn this place upside down if you must,

116
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,920
find me the iron shield!

117
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,920
Yes. Hurry!

118
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,080
Officer Gao.

119
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,960
If the Prime Minister has caught Song,

120
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,080
why doesn't he just kill him?

121
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,800
What do you know?

122
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,920
Song was a trusted official
of the late emperor.

123
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,640
He contributed much to the nation.

124
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,480
the late emperor rewarded him
an iron shield of pardon.

125
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,160
His life can be spared
if he's committed a felony.

126
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,600
The Prime Minister worries that

127
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,440
his family might present the iron shield.

128
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,880
And the emperor would pardon him.

129
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,320
That's why he sent us here,

130
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,200
to locate the iron shield.

131
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,720
Nothing!

132
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,280
I'm sure
his wife and daughter have got it,

133
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,520
they must be heading to the capital now.

134
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,040
Instructor Ma.

135
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,080
Here.

136
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,240
Take this document and leave first,

137
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,720
notify the local magistrates on the way,

138
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,160
put the mother and daughter
on the wanted list.

139
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,600
Claim that they stole a national treasure.

140
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,680
Yes, sir.

141
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,520
Instructor Niu and I will try to
catch them on the way.

142
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,320
Yes. Let's go!

143
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,240
"Wanted"

144
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,640
Everyone knows that
Scholar Song is a loyal official.

145
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,680
This sure is a set-up.

146
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,560
Imperial court is trying to nab
a mother and a daughter.

147
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,360
And here you are, a mother and a daughter.

148
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,200
Follow us!

149
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,120
Come on!

150
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,720
No...we're just street entertainers.

151
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,360
We're not...

152
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,960
I don't believe you...

153
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,160
No...

154
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,720
You're street entertainers?

155
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,240
Very well, sing to us.

156
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,520
That's right. Sing.

157
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:57,080
Mulan weaves, facing the door.

158
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:11,280
One hears only her sighs
but not the weaving shuttle!

159
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:25,160
Asking Mulan about
what's on her mind and who she misses.

160
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:37,640
She says no one is on her mind.

161
00:17:47,440 --> 00:18:00,560
Last night I saw draft posters
for the troops' call-in.

162
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:13,880
And my father's name
is on the recruitment list.

163
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:26,600
Father has no grown up son,
Mulan has no elder brother.

164
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:39,000
And I'll go to war in my father's place.

165
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,320
Bravo!

166
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,680
Not bad at all! What a pretty girl!

167
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,240
I trust that you're street entertainers,

168
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,480
but I still have to search you.

169
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Search?

170
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,400
A national treasure has been
stolen from the palace.

171
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,960
The thieves are a mother and daughter,

172
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,840
that's why we must search you.

173
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,880
How could this be?

174
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,840
Well, it's the law! We must do this.

175
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,440
Stop! How dare you

176
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,400
bully women in broad daylight?

177
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,800
We're under orders to locate
the national treasure.

178
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,360
Who are you? Why are you obstructing?

179
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,080
Searching for
a stolen piece of national treasure?

180
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,680
What national treasure?

181
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,720
What is it?

182
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,040
Not only that we don't know,

183
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,480
not even the local magistrate knows.

184
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,040
If you don't know what's missing,

185
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,000
then how do you know
what you're looking for? Get lost!

186
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,480
What...now?

187
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,560
Thank you.

188
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,640
Is there a better room?

189
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,040
Damn!

190
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,200
Who does he think he is? Damn it!

191
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,520
Take a look.

192
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,040
Imperial guard.

193
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,480
Please forgive us, sir.

194
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,280
You're a forgiving man.

195
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,800
I'm very sorry.

196
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,840
Prepare two superior rooms for us!

197
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,880
Yes...this way please.

198
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,600
What was that?

199
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,800
Do you have vacant rooms?

200
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,480
Yes, this way please.

201
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,800
This way...

202
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,960
Please...

203
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,760
Do you know that girl?

204
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,600
Yes, I've seen them before.
Which room are they in?

205
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,640
That one.

206
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,200
I'll take this room.

207
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,480
Yes...

208
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,320
This way please.

209
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,320
Who's he?

210
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,000
He's our regular customer.

211
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,400
A worker at Imperial Kiln in
the Valley of the Fangs.

212
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,320
Kiln worker?

213
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,520
Yes.

214
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,560
Tell him to get lost.

215
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,920
What? I'm a paying customer also!

216
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,600
Why should I move?

217
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,960
Sit down...

218
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,400
Lamb, and some wine.

219
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,480
Yes...

220
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,040
Who's she?

221
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,360
She's staying here.

222
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,120
I heard she's a street performer.

223
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,120
Tell her to entertain me.

224
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,280
Certainly...

225
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,240
Waiter.

226
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,280
Pretty gal.

227
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,440
What? Where's the girl?

228
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,680
The lady said she has a sore throat today.

229
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:55,280
Sore throat?
Should I pick her up in a sedan chair?

230
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,720
Alright...I'll fetch her.

231
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,840
Idiot.

232
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,240
Cheers.

233
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,720
Come on, sing me a song.

234
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,960
I'll reward you if you sing well.

235
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,440
Thank you.

236
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:55,640
Flowers blossom in spring...

237
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,680
That's not good. Sing the Nun's song.

238
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,040
I don't know that.

239
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,840
Eighteen Grind?

240
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,160
What about "In the bridal suite"?

241
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:19,560
An eighteen year old bride
and a 9 years old groom,

242
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:27,280
they've reached the bridal suite
after the ceremony.

243
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:34,640
Bride undresses the groom
and carries him onto the bed.

244
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:41,680
The groom's scared
and screams for his mother.

245
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,160
Mother!

246
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,960
Please behave.

247
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,400
What? You're a street performer,

248
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,600
stop acting like some lady.

249
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,920
Miss, you need this to make a living.

250
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,880
You can't afford to break this,

251
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,040
please be careful.

252
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,880
Impressive.

253
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,360
Thank you for your compliments.

254
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,240
May I ask your name?

255
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,000
You Rulong.

256
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,440
What a pleasure.

257
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,400
Let me drink to you.

258
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,520
Thank you.

259
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,840
Please.

260
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,640
This is great, let's have another drink.

261
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,560
Oh no!

262
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,400
I think he's found out about us.

263
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,000
From his looks
he doesn't seem like a bad fellow.

264
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,600
Can't say; it's written clearly
on the wanted posters.

265
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,720
Big reward if we're caught

266
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,400
Who wouldn't want a reward?

267
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,680
Then, why did he

268
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,560
help us at the teahouse?

269
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,160
Could be a plan.

270
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:52,280
He's trying to follow us,

271
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,240
then he could arrest us
and get the shield.

272
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,040
And he could make his way
to the local magistracy.

273
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,000
Look.

274
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,880
He's having a good time
with the imperial guard,

275
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
they could be working together.

276
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,320
We better hurry and save your father.

277
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,160
Alas, if only
my cousin Shikai would be here!

278
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,320
With your skills,

279
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,120
why don't you find an officer's job
in the capital?

280
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,080
Why wander around like this?

281
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,160
Is it because you don't have a referee?

282
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,440
If you want to, there's a good chance now.

283
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,520
Do you know...

284
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,760
To be an officer?

285
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,320
Come on...let's have a drink.

286
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,040
What is it about? Chance to be an officer?

287
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,920
Beat it.

288
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,240
The court is after a mother and a daughter
surnamed Song.

289
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,920
The word is
they stole a piece of national treasure.

290
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,720
Nab them and you've a chance
to be an officer and rich.

291
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,480
With such a rare opportunity,

292
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,680
why don't you seize it yourself?

293
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,680
I came all the way
from the capital just for this,

294
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,360
except I couldn't find them.

295
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,240
If only I could catch them,

296
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,280
I'll be promoted to Deputy Commander.

297
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,520
You're...

298
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,760
I failed to recognise a great person,
so you are...

299
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,600
I rushed from the capital
to take care of this.

300
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,000
If I catch them,

301
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,560
I'm going to be promoted for sure.

302
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,560
Good luck! Come on, let me drink to you.

303
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,640
Cheers.

304
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,040
Cheers.

305
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,480
Hurry.

306
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,640
Cousin Shikai.

307
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,280
Shikai, what happened to you?

308
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:18,840
You're injured.

309
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,160
Where's the iron shield?

310
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,200
We have it.

311
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,240
You must leave right now,

312
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,560
Gao Sixian,
the Commander of Imperial Guards

313
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,000
is about to reach here.

314
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:31,840
What?

315
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,760
You must hurry to the capital
to save uncle.

316
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,840
You're badly hurt, find a place to heal.

317
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,160
Don't worry about me.

318
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,040
Hurry.

319
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,800
Cousin Shikai,
you should go to Jingping Mountain

320
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,320
and look for your martial arts teacher
to heal you.

321
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,840
Search!

322
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,400
Commander Gao, what are you searching for?

323
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,640
Is there a mother and daughter
street performers here?

324
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:17,320
Street performers?
Yes, I've seen them; Upstairs.

325
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,560
Arrest them.

326
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,960
Arrest them?

327
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,440
They are the Song mother and daughter.

328
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,040
Idiot.

329
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,600
Chase them.

330
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,720
Search!

331
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,960
May I ask your name?

332
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:54,240
I'm You Rulong, what could I do for you?

333
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,160
They've offended you
at the teahouse yesterday,

334
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,520
my apologies.

335
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,840
Don't worry about it.

336
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,720
I'd like to ask the whereabouts
of two persons.

337
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,160
The street performers, right?

338
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,360
You're mistaken.

339
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,680
I just happened to meet them yesterday.
But no idea

340
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,800
where they're from or
where they're heading.

341
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,880
Let me speak frankly,

342
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,280
they're on the
Imperial Court's wanted list.

343
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:31,120
If only you could tell me
where they're headed,

344
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,640
the Imperial Court will reward you.

345
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,480
I'm sorry, I couldn't help you on this.

346
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,560
Goodbye.

347
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,920
Great moves.

348
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,360
Thank you.

349
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,720
Goodbye.

350
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,680
If you don't tell me

351
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,880
where they're hiding,
you won't make it out of here.

352
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,840
Mother, I wonder if cousin Shikai is safe.

353
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,480
Don't worry.

354
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,400
Mother, let's go and ask for lodging
in the village.

355
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,600
Alright...One

356
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:56,920
A pair.

357
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,600
Eight.

358
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,240
A pair of daggers.

359
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,640
It's raining again, boss.

360
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,400
No one's here to order us to work,
what's the rush?

361
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,200
Come on, join us.

362
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,560
Even the heavens aren't on our side,

363
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,280
we can't work in the rain.

364
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,720
The deadline is almost up,

365
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,120
I worry that we'll be executed then.

366
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,360
Damn it! The emperor wants a new palace
just for fun.

367
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,520
And us? We're so unlucky.

368
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,360
We're his slaves, making bricks and tiles.

369
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,080
And he wants to execute us?

370
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,960
Forget it.

371
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,440
If he really wants to do so,

372
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:39,720
I'd go back to my original trade,
as a robber.

373
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,840
Don't be so pessimistic.

374
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,880
Let's enjoy the good times while we can.

375
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Come on...

376
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,640
Damn! Where the hell is Hu San?

377
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:56,920
He's been gone for three days!

378
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,760
I want a drink!

379
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,080
What could he be up to?

380
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,640
He's trapped here for so long,

381
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,160
I'm sure he's having a great time outside.

382
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,880
Speak of the devil.

383
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,920
We're passing by,

384
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,560
could you let us to stay here

385
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,080
for the night please?

386
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,560
Certainly...

387
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:32,040
There's a lot of space
since we aren't working. Come in

388
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,160
You're street entertainers?

389
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,000
Yes.

390
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,480
Running around in this kind of weather,

391
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,640
trying to make a living. It's not easy.

392
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,640
Thank you.

393
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:53,440
You're welcome. It's our pleasure.

394
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,600
You haven't eaten?

395
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,320
We've some food in the kitchen,

396
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,880
let me heat it up for you.

397
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:08,880
Look! You're soaked.

398
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,920
Get changed first, and then eat.

399
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,360
Ding Qi,
take them to the loft at the back.

400
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,840
Please follow me.

401
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,320
Thank you, everyone.

402
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,560
It's humid here,
it's better to sleep upstairs.

403
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,760
Come over for food when you've changed.

404
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,640
Thank you.

405
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,560
Thank you.

406
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,640
They seem crude,

407
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,520
but they're very kind.

408
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,080
Dad did in fact mention many a time

409
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,080
that ordinary folks often
have bigger hearts.

410
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,560
Come on!

411
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,280
It's raining really heavily.

412
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,520
You are so nice to me.

413
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,080
Hold on, this is for the guests.

414
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,240
Guests?
But we're in the middle of nowhere.

415
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,360
Hu San, I'm serious.

416
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,840
There're 2 street performers
putting up for the night.

417
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,920
Who cares? I'm starving.

418
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,520
Boss, did you see
they're staying here for the night?

419
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,000
Who're they?

420
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,680
A mother and daughter, street performers.

421
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,720
Do they carry a pipa with them?

422
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,720
You know them?

423
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,560
No.

424
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,560
Where're they now?

425
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,960
Getting changed in the loft.

426
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,560
I'll take a look.

427
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,960
Drink up...

428
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:20,840
Give me some.

429
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,000
Me too.

430
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,160
Hold on...

431
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:28,040
Let me tell you some good news!
We'll be rich and famous.

432
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,360
A reward offered to
whoever catches a pair of thieves

433
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,040
who stole a national treasure
and support a rebel.

434
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,960
If we locate them and the goods,
we'll be rich.

435
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,840
And who are they?

436
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,040
A mother and daughter.

437
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,200
Mother and daughter?

438
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,400
There could be plenty,
where can we find them?

439
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:51,400
Too easy,
they're right underneath your nose.

440
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,040
This is a godsend.

441
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,320
People have tried so hard to catch them
but to no avail

442
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,680
And then there are those
who haven't done a thing,

443
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,520
and they walked up to you.

444
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:08,480
Are you saying the street performers?

445
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,560
Hu San, are you sure?

446
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,920
They're just pretending to be
street performers.

447
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,960
I heard them sing in the inn,

448
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,240
but they sneaked out

449
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,360
before the officers arrived.

450
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,320
Come on, let's go!

451
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,240
Go...

452
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,160
Where?

453
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,960
Tie them up. Let's get them

454
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,480
to the local magistry
for a reward in the morning.

455
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:31,880
Yes, let's go.

456
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:32,880
Wait!

457
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,400
On the 'Wanted' poster it states that
they're the

458
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,840
supporters of a rebel.

459
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,960
Who's the rebel then?

460
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,600
Song Yuan,
Senior Lecturer of Imperial Academy.

461
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:50,440
Song Yuan?

462
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,240
Trusted by the late emperor
to teach the young emperor.

463
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:58,000
How's it possible that he's a rebel?

464
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:01,960
Something's wrong. It must be

465
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:07,320
the wicked Prime Minister Jia Shoudao
intervening.

466
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,920
Why would a rebel steal
a piece of national treasure?

467
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,120
It can't be right.

468
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:16,000
Who cares?

469
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,640
As long as we get rewarded.

470
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,000
Yes, to be rich and famous.

471
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,760
Great!

472
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:26,760
Who wants to stay here
and have a tough life!

473
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:27,600
No!

474
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,640
We can't harm the family of a loyal man.

475
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,320
The boss is right, we must protect them.

476
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:42,320
I wouldn't do such dirty dealings.

477
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,120
Enough with the lecture!

478
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,440
We were a bunch of bandits before,

479
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,360
were we doing dirty dealings?

480
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,360
That's why I stopped and
gave in to the Imperial Court.

481
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,000
And became a kiln worker here.

482
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,560
It's all because of your stupid idea!

483
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,640
Gave in to the Imperial Court!

484
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,480
Not only that we didn't get a good job,

485
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:06,200
we're being sent here to be slaves.

486
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,800
I won't listen to you anymore.

487
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,560
Whoever wants to be rich, follow me!

488
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,320
Stop!

489
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,280
I'll fight whoever tries to harm them.

490
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,600
Very well!
Let's settle this once and for all.

491
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,080
We'll go upstairs to take care of them.

492
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,040
Go!

493
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,880
Don't blame me for what I'm about to do!

494
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,080
This is the end of our friendship!

495
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:59,240
Come on.

496
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,800
Don't worry! I know about you.

497
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,120
We'll try to save you

498
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,800
no matter what! Run!

499
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:13,960
Thank you!

500
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,960
I'm going to kill them!

501
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,640
Burn!

502
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:29,600
What now?

503
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,120
They'll turn into steamed buns
in a minute!

504
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,000
In your dreams.

505
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:05,920
We could only repay your kindness

506
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:08,200
in our next lives.

507
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,840
What are you talking about?

508
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,480
We can't drag you into this.

509
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,920
I'll surrender.

510
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,120
Please! I'm here.

511
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,880
But leave those three men
and my mother alone.

512
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:32,960
You see?

513
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,360
Bring the stuff down here.

514
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,120
Come on...

515
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,360
Come on.

516
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,800
Move!

517
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,400
Now that you've admitted.

518
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,240
Hand out the national treasure.

519
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:00,160
We don't have any.

520
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,200
We were being framed.

521
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,360
Stop making excuses.

522
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,720
Where're you hiding it? Speak up.

523
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,440
There's trick in it.

524
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:40,960
Move aside!

525
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:45,520
Stop!

526
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:27,960
I'll kill you.

527
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,480
Spare our lives!

528
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,920
We wouldn't do this again.

529
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,080
For old times' sake.

530
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,840
Get up then.

531
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:43,480
Thank you, swordsman.

532
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,720
Don't mention it! But he's escaped.

533
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,040
Lucky for him.

534
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:51,360
He's a heartless person,

535
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:53,240
I doubt that he'd
show his face around here again.

536
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:16,120
If the road to the capital
wouldn't be flooded,

537
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,160
I wouldn't be meeting you here.

538
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:21,720
The road to the capital got flooded?

539
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,800
Then you should stay here
for a few more days.

540
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,200
It's a good idea, mother.

541
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:28,800
Let's stay here for now.

542
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,520
I guess Gao Sixian and the lot
won't find out.

543
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,040
I just worry that if we got delayed,

544
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,800
Jia Shoudao will harm your father.

545
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,680
As long as they don't get a hold

546
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,120
of the iron shield,

547
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,880
they wouldn't dare to kill Mr. Song.

548
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:46,960
I just worry about Hu San.

549
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,760
Commander, I was looking for you.

550
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,120
Thank you for saving us,

551
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:24,040
I don't know how to repay you.

552
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,400
It's my duty to do this for a just cause.

553
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:34,760
Swordsman You, you're an esteemed person.

554
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:49,880
Hand out the Song mother and daughter,

555
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,560
we'll kill anyone who's in the way.

556
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:58,320
Brother Gao.

557
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,240
Oh, we meet again.

558
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,760
What a coincidence.

559
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:08,400
Pleasure.

560
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:11,520
Brother Gao, I'd like to say something.

561
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:12,680
Go on.

562
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,360
Brother Gao, you're so skilled,

563
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:19,040
why would you be hurting innocent people?

564
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,760
You're lecturing me? How dare you!

565
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:25,720
Catch him!

566
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,160
Official Zheng.

567
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,440
What's going on?

568
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,360
We're here to build tiles and bricks,

569
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:55,160
but this man looks down upon
His Majesty's orders.

570
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,200
He's here to make a scene,
please look into this.

571
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:05,480
Who are you?
Why are you being so arrogant?

572
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:09,080
I'm Gao Sixian,
I'm here for an investigation.

573
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:13,040
You're Commander Gao
of the Imperial Guards.

574
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:14,000
Yes, I am.

575
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,280
This is the site of an Imperial kiln.

576
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,200
Could you tell me what

577
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:21,200
investigation you're working on,
Commander Gao?

578
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:24,000
Disobeying His Majesty's orders,
sheltering rebels.

579
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:28,080
Sheltering rebels? Who are the rebels?

580
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:35,880
Official Zheng, they're no rebels.

581
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,160
They're the family of a loyal official.

582
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:41,880
Yes, the wife and daughter of
Senior Lecturer Song Yuan.

583
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:49,760
I've heard about this in the capital.

584
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:55,840
If that's the case,

585
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,320
then I must arrest the rebels.

586
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:58,440
Go!

587
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:02,120
I'll fight to the death with
whoever harms the innocent

588
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,760
Says who? I'm doing a job.

589
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:05,960
If you are,

590
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:09,160
why aren't you in uniform?

591
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,480
Commander Gao.

592
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:24,880
Yes, Official Zheng?

593
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:30,680
I'm here because
the King wants to build a new palace,

594
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:34,240
I'm here under His Majesty's orders
to supervise.

595
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:40,000
If you try to capture rebels
on this work site,

596
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:43,600
and the kiln workers
are trying to protect them;

597
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:46,920
What if there are conflicts?

598
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:51,000
Agreed, there would be casualties
on both sides

599
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:56,800
but delaying the work
would be a big problem.

600
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:02,960
Then, I wouldn't be able to explain this,

601
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:08,120
and I suppose so will you, Commander Gao.

602
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,200
What do you suggest, Official Zheng?

603
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:17,600
I think the kiln workers

604
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:22,800
should get to finishing the job
before the deadline.

605
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:25,840
As for the Song mother and daughter,

606
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:29,320
they should stay here.

607
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,800
After the work's done,

608
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:33,720
no matter whether you're
arresting the rebels,

609
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:38,000
or the kiln workers
protecting the innocent. It's okay.

610
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:48,760
Since it's your wish, Official Zheng.
I'll do it.

611
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:53,160
Let's go!

612
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,240
Thank you, Official Zheng.

613
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:27,040
It's Official Zheng's delaying tactic.

614
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:29,760
Gao Sixian has blocked all the exits.

615
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,800
How can we escape?

616
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,440
We still have a few days,

617
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:37,320
we'll think of something.

618
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:48,560
Commander, that Zheng fellow

619
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:50,800
is only a supervisor
in the Ministry of Works,

620
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:52,480
why would you listen to him?

621
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,320
What did I tell you?

622
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,760
If we leak out the secret
about the iron shield,

623
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:01,040
the Prime Minister will be angry at us.

624
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:04,400
And besides, You Rulong is quite skillful.

625
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:05,840
That's why...

626
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:32,280
Let's go.

627
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:57,080
Look for the iron shield.

628
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:58,320
Yes.

629
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,240
Hurry to find the iron shield!

630
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:01,120
I'm sorry that I can't help you anymore.

631
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:03,680
How can we blame you?

632
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:07,120
If we can't find that iron shield,

633
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:09,440
I guess it's destiny.

634
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:14,640
Strange, how come?

635
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:29,200
Ding Qi.

636
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:30,640
Official Zheng.

637
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:32,920
Whom is it for?

638
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:35,480
Mrs. Song and her daughter

639
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:54,120
Thank you.

640
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:55,760
You're welcome. Eat up.

641
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,920
Must be Official Zheng's idea.

642
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,080
But Gao Sixian has blocked all the exits,

643
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:18,920
how can we leave here?

644
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:21,000
I've got a plan,

645
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,280
but we need Ding Qi's help.

646
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:29,440
Have you got it?

647
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:31,960
They're sleeping like pigs.

648
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,400
I stole them right away.

649
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,160
Bring them upstairs to change into.

650
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:37,080
Sure.

651
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:08,400
Where are you going?

652
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:21,960
Thank you.

653
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:23,960
Let's go!

654
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:34,800
So none of the kiln workers

655
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:37,120
has seen the iron shield?

656
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:39,840
I've been asking around,

657
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:41,920
no one has seen it.

658
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:45,960
Oh no! Our men got killed!

659
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:47,080
Come on!

660
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:12,880
Chase after them!

661
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:13,840
Yes.

662
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:16,200
Don't bother.

663
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,080
They don't have the iron shield yet.

664
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:20,840
I know.

665
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,520
Tell me, where is it?

666
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:26,040
If I tell you,

667
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:28,320
how would you reward me, Commander Gao?

668
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:30,280
What do you want?

669
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:35,920
How about the
Deputy Commander of the Imperial Guards?

670
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:37,320
I've always aspired for an official post.

671
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:43,400
That's easy, I'll help you.

672
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:44,800
Don't worry.

673
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:54,800
So he's meddling.

674
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:59,600
I've contributed a lot, right?

675
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:10,480
Indeed. You deserve a good reward.

676
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:16,440
Commander...

677
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:20,440
We'll head back to the capital tomorrow.

678
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:21,440
Yes.

679
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,360
Sending Official Zheng off.

680
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:26,640
Official Zheng, it's really you!

681
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:35,960
I've always admired Mr. Song's character
and wisdom.

682
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:38,400
When we were in Valley of the Fangs,

683
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:41,400
I couldn't be too specific.

684
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,400
Please forgive me.

685
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:44,880
Thank you, Official Zheng.

686
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:49,840
This is the capital;

687
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:52,600
Not only the Imperial Guard lackeys,

688
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:55,280
but even their head Jia Shoudao,

689
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,680
must respect the laws to certain extent.

690
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:00,920
That's why I asked you to meet me here.

691
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,160
Present this to His Majesty
and save Professor Song.

692
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,400
Thank you for your help.

693
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:56,840
Go!

694
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:03,360
Cousin Shikai.

695
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:49,480
Swordsman You.

696
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:09,560
Swordsman You.

697
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:10,720
Professor Song.

698
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:13,200
Must you go, Swordsman You?

699
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:14,200
Yes.

700
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:37,000
Thank you for saving my life.
I was going to invite

701
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:40,800
you for dinner at my home
to express my gratitude.

702
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:44,960
You're too generous, I didn't do much.

703
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:57,760
You're a chivalrous swordsman!

704
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:01,800
I'd like to learn from you.

705
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:06,160
Miss Song,
I don't deserve such a compliment.

706
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:14,640
Although we've met by chance,

707
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:16,880
but we are good friends.

708
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,080
I believe we shall meet again.

709
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:30,680
Jie, since Swordsman You is
determined to leave,

710
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,560
we shouldn't be in his way.

711
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:38,880
I'm certain that

712
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:42,680
we'll see him again
sometime in the future.

713
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:50,400
I've no valuables with me,
and we have to part.

714
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:53,320
I do have a scroll of calligraphy,

715
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:57,480
I wrote that when I was in prison.

716
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,400
I wish you'd accept it.

717
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:11,640
"A benevolent person
always begets kindness"

718
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:23,360
I'll always remember your teachings,
Professor.

719
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:28,440
It's just a small token
to show my appreciation.

720
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:33,280
You're too kind, sir.

721
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:35,200
Goodbye.

722
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:40,720
Take care, Swordsman You.

723
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:42,840
You too take care of yourself.

724
01:25:42,840 --> 01:26:08,640
A real swordsman asks not
in return for his favours.
