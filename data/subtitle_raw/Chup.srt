1
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,840
<i>Here, stop right here!</i>

2
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,520
<i>Thank you.</i>

3
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,360
<i>- See you on Tuesday. Bye.
- Bye.</i>

4
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:27,850
Oh, God!

5
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,480
<i>Please close the door.</i>

6
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,200
Idiots!

7
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,560
Where is he?

8
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,760
Nitin...

9
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,920
My darling Miku.
Has nobody fed you?

10
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,720
Eat... eat.

11
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,280
The power is on...

12
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,720
Water?

13
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,000
Sir... no sign of a forced entry.

14
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,240
Excuse me.

15
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,040
Cuts are precise and perfect,
like a surgeon's work.

16
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,680
Except this. Not so perfect.

17
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,720
Maybe the nurse did it...

18
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,280
Cellophane paper, sir.

19
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,600
Thin but very strong.
We're checking for fingerprints.

20
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,200
Was he sliced from bottom to top
or top to bottom?

21
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,440
Er... the autopsy report
will tell us, sir.

22
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,320
First the neck was cut.

23
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,520
Then these 'designer' cuts
were made at leisure.

24
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,840
Had he been alive,
he would have struggled,

25
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,760
the cuts would not have been so smooth.

26
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,880
Nitin... what?

27
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,160
Nitin Srivastav, a film critic.

28
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,910
He wrote film reviews for firstview.com.

29
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,080
Film critic!

30
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,640
Any CCTV footage from the building?

31
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,000
This is an old building, sir.
The security guard is the CCTV here.

32
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,040
He says that Srivastav had not
stepped out today

33
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,320
and he had no visitors.

34
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,600
- According to forensics, the murder was...
- What is this?

35
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,160
Triangle, sir.

36
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,160
Draw it.

37
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,480
A triangle would look like that.

38
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,560
Why is this inverted?

39
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,240
- Good morning, Danny.
- Good morning.

40
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,200
Bye, Danny.

41
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,840
Let's go!

42
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,480
Shit! There's just one egg.

43
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,840
Forgot to buy them again?

44
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,120
You should have reminded me.

45
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,520
I forgot too.

46
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,560
Kaleem bhai, here we come?

47
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,800
'...incident took place
in Jogeshwari, Mumbai.'

48
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,360
'The victim Nitin Srivastav
was alone at home

49
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,880
when he was murdered.'

50
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,520
- 'The police don't have any leads yet.'
- Wait a minute.

51
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,440
- I want more bread.
- Get to work.

52
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,360
Sorry, Danny.

53
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,880
When there's no cricket match
there's murder! Damn TV.

54
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,320
What's going on, Kaleem bhai?

55
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,720
Some film...

56
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,640
- What do you call them?
- Critic.

57
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,280
Yes. He was brutally murdered.

58
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,600
I've always said

59
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,000
Oshiwara and Jogeshwari
are extremely dangerous areas.

60
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,840
Why isn't it so tasty at home?

61
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,040
We don't add sweat and grime
at home.

62
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,960
Sir, post mortem report says,
two weapons were used.

63
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,080
One on the neck and another
on the body.

64
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,920
But how did the killer enter the house?

65
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,160
Besides the husband and wife,
nobody had the house keys.

66
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,880
No lock tampering.

67
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,160
Srivastav didn't open the door,
he was in the toilet.

68
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,480
Srivastav opened the door!

69
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,240
- But...
- The bell rang.

70
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,800
Srivastav opened the door.
The killer entered.

71
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,520
Srivastav was found on the pot
doesn't mean,

72
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,440
he was on the pot.

73
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,720
Any motive?

74
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,320
Nothing in the phone records.

75
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,480
They were a happy couple. No children.

76
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,680
No property issues. No enemies.

77
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,680
At the website he worked for

78
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,600
he hardly interacted
with other journalists.

79
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,440
He'd watch films,
email reviews from home.

80
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,960
Give me the photograph
of the cellophane paper.

81
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,000
Looks like gift-wrapping paper, sir.
No fingerprints.

82
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,480
Mrs. Srivastav confirmed
she hasn't seen it before.

83
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,040
This pattern looks very familiar...

84
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,840
I still can't believe it.

85
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,640
Wonderful man. A senior critic
but no ego.

86
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,880
He called me last week
after reading my review.

87
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,240
The building had no security cameras.
Crazy!

88
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,680
Poor Mrs. Srivastav.
Can't imagine what she's going through.

89
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,840
Don't feel like writing a review now.

90
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,040
There is a screening at 6 p.m.

91
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,840
Screening? Isn't the press-show tomorrow?

92
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,440
Ajay (movie star) didn't call you?

93
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,000
Kartik sir, am I late?

94
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,520
Just catch your breath, Nila. It's okay.

95
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,240
- I'll... just go pay my respects.
- Sure.

96
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,120
Entertainment reporter...
joined recently.

97
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,480
Loves cinema.

98
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,600
Stop. Stop.

99
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,960
Mom's been chewing my head...

100
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,080
flowers, flowers...
found them finally.

101
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,120
Danny's Flowers... so nice.

102
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,760
Everything in Bandra is nice,
except the rent!

103
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,160
No one in the shop.

104
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:58,200
Good... no one pestering,
'buy this, buy that'.

105
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,480
Hey, pink and white lilies.

106
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,320
Mom wanted something more exotic.

107
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,320
Sunflowers or orchids?

108
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,400
What were those flowers
in that 'Silsila' film song?

109
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,160
Tulips, tulips...

110
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,520
Won't get tulips here.

111
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,600
Have to go to Amsterdam for them.

112
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,560
Tulips.

113
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,840
<i>♪ Who knows what you said? ♪</i>

114
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,920

115
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,680

00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,600
<i>♪ Who knows what you said? ♪</i>

117
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,800
Excuse me.

118
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,520
I forgot to pay.

119
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,320
- It's okay.
- Please, I insist.

120
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,360
No, no... it's okay.

121
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,720
- It's not okay.
- The card machine is not working.

122
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,000
Next time?

123
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,200
Thank you.

124
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,040

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,400

Stop dreaming. Stop!

127
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,160
She's just like us.

128
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,440
So? You'll give away flowers for free?

129
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,600
Tulips in Bandra! Cool!

130
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,440
Very cool... flowers and the florist.

131
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,440
Yes, Srini.

132
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,760
Sir, according to the lab reports,

133
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,000
the cellophane paper is
at least ten years old.

134
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,200
This pattern is not available
anywhere, sir.

135
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,520
We've checked all the gift shops.

136
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,600
In fact, none of the manufacturers
have seen this pattern, sir.

137
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,800
I've also checked with
a few old manufacturers.

138
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,120
First check who is at your door.

139
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,280
Yes, sir?

140
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,800
When Mrs. Srivastav rang the doorbell...
it rang, right?

141
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,000
Yes, sir.

142
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,680
She opened the door...

143
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,000
it was dark inside,
the fuse was off...

144
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,640
then how did the doorbell ring?

145
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,400
Shit!

146
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,560
Of course, sir.

147
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,160
After the doorbell rang

148
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,120
and before Mrs. Srivastav
entered the house,

149
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,560
somebody turned off the power,
which means--

150
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,760
The killer was inside the house
when she entered.

151
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,720
Let's go. Finish this at home.

152
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,680
No, Richa,
I really have to send this interview

153
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,480
otherwise they'll kill me. I'm sorry.

154
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,120
- Bye.
- Hey, did you know Nitin Srivastav?

155
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,400
Why?

156
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,440
You attended his prayer meeting...

157
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,600
I didn't know him personally, but

158
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,000
we've always had like
a strange connection.

159
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,240
I've been following his reviews
since my college days.

160
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,640
The films he gave
a one or two star rating to,

161
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,240
like this 'Paani Paani Re'...

162
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,920
I would love those films.
I loved 'Paani Paani Re'!

163
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,960
And when he gave a four star rating,
I knew...

164
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,680
I wouldn't like the film.

165
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,640
Our opinions were different
but, so what?

166
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,640
At least he was honest about
the kind of cinema he liked.

167
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,840
This is India...

168
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,000
Shetty's films work here,
not Scorcese's!

169
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,080
And if Nitin rated a film four stars,
it's a sure hit.

170
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,200
Hit means a good film?
I don't agree.

171
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,400
Bye, guys.

172
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,880
- Bye, sir.
- Bye.

173
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,680
You know, I like Kartik sir's reviews.

174
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,000
He knows cinema.

175
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,480
One day... One day.

176
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,400
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

177
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:51,880
Shit!

178
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,360
When does Nature's Basket close?

179
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,350
Yellow lentils... I'm getting it.

180
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:13,800
Orange lentils... calm down.
Got it.

181
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,440
Turmeric powder...

182
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,310
Patience, I'm looking for it.

183
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,590
Cow ghee...

184
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,830
Why is cow ghee so expensive?
Let's just get a cow.

185
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,310
Sugar-free chocolate?

186
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,200
Since when are you diabetic?

187
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,800
Okay, you're the boss.

188
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,760
Don't forget the eggs!

189
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,120
Admiring natural beauty
in Nature's Basket?

190
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,480
I can't help it,
it's nature's conspiracy.

191
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,480
Bangalore was better,
at least you ate on time.

192
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,160
I haven't come to Mumbai to eat.

193
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,000
Everything is so expensive here...

194
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,520
makes sense to eat less.

195
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,600
I never knew tulips smell so nice.

196
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,120
It feels so romantic.

197
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,880
The flowers are not creating the feeling,

198
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,400
Amit Trivedi's song is.

199
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,680
They should never make films
without songs.

200
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,000
Nice to live next to a film studio.

201
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,600
Flowers and songs...

202
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,360
Will I get a role in a film?

203
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,640
Will I get some pickle?

204
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,600
What will you do if I find a real lover?

205
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,880
I'll move the furniture around...
you'll keep tripping and falling.

206
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,240
Go ahead.

207
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,880
How else can I fall into somebody's arms?

208
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,240
Get out.

209
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,880
Who would kill a film critic?

210
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,960
- Sir, maybe some underworld connection?
- Don't waste your time.

211
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,600
They would have shot husband,
wife and the cat and left.

212
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,000
Somebody has spent time
and enjoyed this.

213
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:09,680
Tell me, what sort of a relationship does
the film industry have with critics?

214
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,040
Film guys and media
have a love-hate relationship, sir.

215
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,960
Once, this actor called up a journalist...

216
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,160
Film critics and the film industry
have just one connection...

217
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,760
Reviews!

218
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,360
Sir, that's it.

219
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,440
That's it!

220
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,920
'Paani Paani Re' was Nitin Srivastav's
last film review. One star!

221
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,840
You kill the critic because
you don't like the review of your film?

222
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,320
Sir, we must question them.

223
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,800
Whom?

224
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,080
The makers of 'Paani Paani', sir.

225
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,760
Why just them?

226
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,320
Nitin Srivastav must have criticised
many films in his life.

227
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,240
But... the murder took place after
this review.

228
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,280
It's very sad.

229
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,120
I just returned from Ajmer this morning.

230
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,760
Ajmer?

231
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,560
Mr. Arvind, since 1992,

232
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:06,400
I go to Ajmer Sharif to pray the day
before the release of any of my films.

233
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,200
You haven't read the reviews of your film?

234
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,800
Reviews? I haven't read a single review
of any of my films till date.

235
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,120
And reviews don't make a film work.

236
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,400
It's all about word of mouth.

237
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,640
The audience didn't like the film,
so it flopped.

238
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,840
Good reviews wouldn't
have made any difference.

239
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,720
Mr. Himani, what are these leaves
on the posters?

240
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,360
Earlier, they were only
on international film posters.

241
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,800
Now it's become fashionable here too.

242
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,080
My gut feeling,
we're on the right track, sir.

243
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,880
Let us meet the director.

244
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,480
This is an intelligent film,
not a potboiler.

245
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,960
It really needed the critics' support.

246
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,360
The reviews have really depressed me.

247
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,160
How depressed were you?

248
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,200
On a scale of one to five...
how much did the reviews affect you?

249
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,560
Sir, I haven't stepped out since Friday.

250
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,480
Even avoiding my lead actor's calls...

251
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,960
I am quite upset.

252
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,880
I was quite close to Mr. Nitin.

253
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,680
He was a dear friend.

254
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,200
Dear friend? But he trashed your film...

255
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,120
Hadn't you lashed out at critics
in an interview?

256
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,280
Give me a second.

257
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,640
It's an old story, sir.

258
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,600
There was a lady
who said something like -

259
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,560
'A tree would be more expressive
than Purab.'

260
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,160
I also said some things.

261
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,520
Anyway, I've forgotten about it.

262
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,040
Done and dusted.

263
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,000
He won't even be able to play
the role of a killer... anybody else?

264
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,080
The light man? Catering man?

265
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,920
The case is not so straightforward.

266
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,240
Go away.

267
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,080
Checked flower shops?

268
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,720
You don't use any plastic?

269
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,720
Isn't it banned?

270
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,440
Okay, let's go.

271
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,080
Hi.

272
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,520
All okay?

273
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,880
They're raiding plastic users.

274
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,720
Good... you know how dangerous plastic is?

275
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,880
But I only use plastic!

276
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,200
Money first then flowers.

277
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,920
It's okay, really.

278
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,880
No, it's not okay.
I'll want flowers regularly.

279
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,520
If you keep giving it for free,
you'll have to shut shop soon.

280
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,960
As long as flowers bloom,
this shop will be open.

281
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,680
What do you think?

282
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,360
I think he is flirting.

283
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,920
Yeah, you're the expert.

284
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,040
I'm just getting the vibes.

285
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,040
You're not getting anything.

286
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,640
No I am serious. Don't do this.

287
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,600
Richa, I'll talk to you later.

288
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,720
Five minutes. I'll call you back.

289
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,640
Yeah. Okay, bye.

290
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,960
So expensive?

291
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,680
'She's just like us!'

292
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,080
You should've looked at her ears
before staring into her eyes.

293
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,680
How could I know she was on the phone?

294
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,360
Found one thing in common
and fell in love?

295
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,240
Film critic.

296
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,560
Filmy cellophane paper.

297
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,440
Why is it inverted?

298
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:15,000
This... is a triangle.

299
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,800
'Two critics have been killed
in two weeks.'

300
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,760
'Last night, famous film critic
Irshad Ali's body was discovered

301
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,120
on the railway tracks
between Nallasopara and Virar.'

302
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,240
'Half the mangled body
was found on the railway track.'

303
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,440
'The rest of the body was crushed
by a speeding train.'

304
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:51,680
'This incident has terrorized
the media and the film industry.'

305
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,600
Both murders have been committed
by the same person.

306
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,560
Same cellophane paper. Same star.

307
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,120
Kills and signs off with a star.

308
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,600
Arvind, what star?

309
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,840
On Nitin Srivastav...

310
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,760
It was half done,
the bell rang, the killer had to flee.

311
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,880
Else, there'd be a star carved
on Nitin Srivastav's forehead too.

312
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,920
Sir, we have got a new kind
of a serial killer...

313
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,160
who is giving stars to people
who give star ratings!

314
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,120
A critic's critic!

315
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,240
I will get off here.

316
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,360
It'll be faster to walk.

317
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,760
Here.

318
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,040
- Wow, are these candles?
- Yes, madam.

319
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,680
- Want a husband candle, madam?
- Husband candle?

320
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,880
Want a husband, take a husband candle.

321
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,880
If you have a husband,
take a baby candle.

322
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,280
If you have both,

323
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,960
take a school, car or airplane.
Only 500 rupees.

324
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,160
500 rupees? Isn't that a lot
for a husband?

325
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,040
I'll give you a family pack,
husband and baby for 700 rupees.

326
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,840
It's nature's conspiracy.

327
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,520
Meet her. What's the problem?

328
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,400
It's good she isn't like us.

329
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,360
Four voices, won't know
who is talking to who.

330
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,000
♪ Who knows what you said? ♪

331
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,320
Stop it.

332
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,080
♪ Who knows what I heard? ♪

333
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,040
Stop!

334
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,600
- This one.
- Doggy candle? 300 rupees.

335
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,400
200.

336
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,600
How can you not like a dog lover?

337
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,840
Fine, 250. Last price.

338
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,120
These are prayer candles, madam.
Be generous...

339
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,600
Okay, give.

340
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,040
No, please. It's okay.

341
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,680
I had overcharged you that day.

342
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,080
So... refund?

343
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,480
How does one light these?

344
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,600
You don't like dogs?

345
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,320
I love dogs... more than people at times.

346
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,680
- Then how can you burn a puppy?
- Are you mad?

347
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,920
I mean it's a candle,
so I was just asking.

348
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,320
I wouldn't set Waxy on fire.

349
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:58,160
I'll take care of him,
feed him, toilet train him.

350
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,880
So cute. My Waxy.

351
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,600
Thank you.

352
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,360
- Return the change.
- Yes, sir.

353
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,360
You don't light these candles.

354
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,880
They are offered to Mother Mary.

355
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,360
You go to church regularly?

356
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,240
When my mother was alive,
she'd force me to.

357
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,600
Now, I force myself to go.

358
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,480
I'm so sorry.

359
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,440
Dad?

360
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,560
- Does your mother like flowers?
- Yes, tulips.

361
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,480
She only likes tulips now.

362
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,160
Can't help it... single mom, fully spoilt.

363
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,440
Waxy, you're going to meet my single,
spoilt mom.

364
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,080
Say thanks to Danny.

365
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,560
What?

366
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,040
Danny's Flowers means you're Danny, no?

367
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,600
Why? I could be Flowers too, Nila.

368
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,480
How do you know my name?

369
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,720
Debit card.

370
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,480
Ah, when you were looting me...

371
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,320
First entice customers with
free flowers and then fleece them.

372
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,440
Good strategy.

373
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,280
Next time, give me a
'frequent flower discount'.

374
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,040
That... depends on the frequency.

375
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,240
Where do you get tulips from?

376
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,720
I grow them...

377
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,160
in my garden.

378
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,120
Tulips grow in Mumbai?

379
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:34,040
With a little love, patience and water,
anything can be grown anywhere.

380
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,400
- Bye.
- Bye.

381
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,080
Why are you grinning like a pig?

382
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,200
Right... a little more to the right.

383
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,640
Wrong! Wrong!

384
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,840
- Good evening, Amit ji.
- Good evening, ma'am.

385
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,000
Okay. Ready? Let's roll.

386
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,240
Your film releases tomorrow.

387
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,520
The film has a name, madam
- 'Third Umpire'...

388
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,480
just like the third umpire in cricket.

389
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,920
But it's not a cricket film,
it's just a metaphor.

390
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,520
Third Umpire.

391
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,160
One who sees what nobody else can.

392
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,280
After all these years... do you still
feel nervous before a film's release?

393
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,760
I get even more nervous today...

394
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,760
Social media is very quick
to declare the result...

395
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,400
I get nervous when the phone beeps.

396
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,840
Actually, it's the critics
who are more nervous these days.

397
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,800
Yeah.

398
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,560
It is very sad.

399
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,600
Two of our finest critics
of the industry, you know,

400
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,280
we've lost them.

401
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,800
I had deep respect for them.

402
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:07,320
I have read all their reviews of my films
and learnt a lot from them.

403
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,760
Are reviews important to you
or only box office matters?

404
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,960
See, ma'am... box office matters.

405
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,600
If films don't work,
who will give me work?

406
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,240
Not just me...
all the workers in this industry.

407
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,800
But you know, reviews are important.

408
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,520
We need critics.

409
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,120
Critiquing is a must for society,
for progress in any field.

410
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,680
Everyone likes to hear praises

411
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,440
but true learning happens

412
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,040
when we are made aware
of our shortcomings...

413
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,960
when somebody shows us
the way to become better.

414
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,360
Cinema needs critics for growth.

415
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:56,400
Cinema needs fearless,
unbiased voices for its evolution.

416
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,320
Careful, sir.

417
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,880
Body parts are scattered
all over the field.

418
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,120
Found 11 till now.

419
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,760
Sir, liver.

420
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,040
Come on, put on the damn lights.

421
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,960
- The same cellophane paper, sir.
- A star on the forehead?

422
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,760
No, this time...

423
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,640
one and a half stars.

424
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,440
The victim is Parikshit Prabhu,

425
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,560
senior film critic, Mumbai Republic.

426
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,720
He gave a one and a half star rating

427
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,840
to the film 'Third Umpire'.

428
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,280
Impossible.

429
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,360
Possible.

430
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,920
She likes dogs, not you.

431
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,440
If she liked dogs,
she would've kept a real one.

432
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,360
She likes craftsmanship, fool.

433
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,960
According to Juhu police,

434
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,120
the CCTV footage of Marriott Hotel shows

435
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,320
Prabhu leaving alone in a car at 11 p.m.

436
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,480
Prabhu may not have driven
to this place alone.

437
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,360
This seat is pushed forward...

438
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,320
maybe the killer was hiding behind it
with a weapon.

439
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,760
Toilet. Railway track.

440
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:25,520
And now a cricket ground.

441
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,400
Sir, the film is called 'Third Umpire'
so... cricket ground?

442
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,760
'Third Umpire'... one and a half stars.

443
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:54,040
'A picture whose heart
is in the right place

444
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,920
but whose other organs
are all over the place'.

445
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,920
He has scattered the organs
all over the ground,

446
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,080
except the heart!

447
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,760
He has been killed according
to what he has written.

448
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,280
Give me the other reviews.

449
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,080
Look at this.

450
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,960
'Lots of loo breaks in this boring,
long film

451
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,640
that should have been cut ruthlessly
in many places'.

452
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,960
Nitin was ruthlessly cut inside a loo.

453
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,400
How didn't we get this?

454
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,720
Irshad Ali - 'First half not bad.

455
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,720
The film is on track'... railway track.

456
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,400
'Second half is a bloody mess'.

457
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,680
Bloody hell!

458
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,640
Danny...

459
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,080
Danny!

460
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,600
It's a holiday for the flowers...

461
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,880
but not for the florist.

462
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,400
Our investigation clearly shows that

463
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,440
the murders that have taken place
in the last three weeks

464
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,520
have been committed by a serial killer.

465
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,480
One who is clearly targeting film critics.

466
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:18,800
I assure you that our best officers
are working on this case.

467
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,360
The public shouldn't panic--

468
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,920
Sir, we hear that the bodies
had a star symbol on them.

469
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,000
Why aren't the police sharing
the full information with the media, sir?

470
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,880
The victims are all from media.

471
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,680
The channels are ripping us apart.

472
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,360
The Home Minister and the Chief Minister
are pressurizing me.

473
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,280
Do you have any clues
apart from the reviews and stars?

474
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,480
Er, sir... the manner of these murders...

475
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,520
There could be another next week.

476
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,320
How are we going to stop it?

477
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,000
We have no fingerprints,
no CCTV footage...

478
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,680
- not one suspect!
- We may not have a suspect

479
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,040
but the targets are all clear.

480
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,240
Friends...

481
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,360
In the light of the shocking
events of the past few weeks,

482
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,560
Mr. Arvind Mathur,
Head of Crime Branch, Mumbai,

483
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,480
would like to address our film critics.

484
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,200
Thank you, all the producers
and directors present.

485
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,320
Sir, the entire film industry is with you.

486
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,120
- Over to you.
- Thank you, sir.

487
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,400
Let me get to the point straightaway...

488
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,240
we need your help.

494
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,840
Should we praise all films?

495
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,000
Sir, we're dealing with a psychopath,

496
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,800
who is committing a murder every week

497
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,960
affected by negative reviews.

498
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:54,640
Till we catch him, we have to make sure
that you are safe...

499
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,040
that is why I'm requesting you.

500
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,440
The police are not doing their job

501
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,680
and stopping us from doing ours.

502
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,200
Sir, I am not stopping you
from doing your job.

503
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,760
If you want us to be safe,
give us security.

504
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,680
Our reviews can be positive or negative,

505
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,040
it is your duty to ensure our security.

506
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,320
- Perfect.
- He is right.

507
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,520
There are at least 300 critics
in Mumbai.

508
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,000
How do we ensure their security 24x7?

509
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,680
You can provide security
to 543 politicians,

510
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,240
but not to 300 critics?

for your security.

517
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,120
Let's stop this reviewing of films.

518
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:46,920
What's the problem?

519
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,560
Why don't you stop making films?

520
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,600
Sir, it is only film industry people
who have issues with critics.

521
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,280
Hello... what nonsense...

522
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,160
If we stop making films
how will you survive?

523
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,400
- Look at what he's saying.
- These producers are big bullies...

524
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,840
Once a producer had even chased a critic
with a knife.

525
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,720
You must be secretly thrilled.

526
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,920
Danny's Flowers.

527
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:55,920
Danny... Danny... where are you?

528
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,600
Who do you want to meet?

529
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,760
Nila Menon. Is she at home?

530
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,960
It is a surprise.

531
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,320
Birthday.

532
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,800
What are these?

533
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,400
Couldn't you find any roses?

534
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,280
Roses are... common.

535
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,600
Please close the door.

536
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,760
You?

537
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,000
It's a week since you visited the shop.

538
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,680
I just passed by your shop.
You closed early today?

539
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,760
And how did you find out where I live?

540
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,200
- You came to the shop?
- Yes.

541
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,760
Thought you must be bored
of fresh flowers.

542
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,720
Wow! Did you...

543
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,160
So beautiful.

544
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,760
So I shouldn't come to the shop anymore?

545
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,760
Apart from the flowers,

546
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,920
is there no other reason
to come to the shop?

547
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,800
Oh, the fragrance of newsprint!

548
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,040
You know I work for a newspaper?

549
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,400
Which one?

550
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,840
If I had known, I would've used that.

551
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,800
Okay, bye.

552
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:51,920
No okay bye.

553
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:54,920
Come in.

554
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,040
Mom!

555
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:56,960
Come here.

556
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,640
Danny, Mr. Tulips.

557
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,280
- Hello.
- Hello.

558
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,160
What are these?
Are the flowers on a strike?

559
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,040
Mom, it's so gorgeous.

560
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,040
Are you a florist or an artist?

561
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,880
Can't a man be both?

562
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,080
A man can be anything he wants, darling...

563
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,000
but paper can't be a flower.

564
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,760
Aunty, tomorrow I'll get tulips--

565
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,960
'Aunty'?

566
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,440
Nila, is he blind?

567
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,360
Sit. Please sit.

568
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,560
Hey, you'll have idli?
Mom makes the best idlis.

569
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,280
I'm fine.

570
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,280
No, you'll have idli.

571
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,040
Waxy? He's sleeping.

572
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,360
Hey, why aren't you on social media?

573
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,880
Because I'm in front of you.

574
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,240
Nila.

575
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,640
He is a flower-seller.

576
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,520
Yeah, so?

577
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,000
Have some thundering-hot idlis
with chutney.

578
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,040
Thank you.

579
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,000
Ma'am...

580
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,000
Sit down.

581
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,240
Won't you eat?

582
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:06,160
Who are you to invite me
to eat in my own house?

583
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,120
Ignore her.

584
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,920
She's like this every time
she sees a guy.

585
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,680
Just focus on your idlis.

586
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,520
Are all delivery guys served idlis,
in this house?

587
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,680
Yes. And the food delivery guy
is served biryani.

588
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,200
The booze delivery guy
has a few pegs before leaving.

589
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,640
Mom, can we have some privacy please?

590
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,080
Sure.

591
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,400
So tell me, have you always been
fond of flowers?

592
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,280
No. Mom loved flowers.

593
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,120
Dead or alive?

594
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,760
Flowers or Mom?

595
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,360
You are my type.

596
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,280
I love Moms.

597
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,360
I am trying.

598
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,560
So tell me, your Mom...

599
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,200
She was a florist.

600
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:46,200
I'm just keeping her shop
and her passion alive.

601
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,920
You are also very passionate about it.

602
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,240
I have become, over time...

603
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:54,960
flowers, gardening, no social media.

604
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,800
It's almost meditative.

605
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,800
Hm, I should also meditate.

606
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
It's only been four months in Mumbai,

607
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,600
and I am already fed up...

608
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,640
what movie stars drink, eat, wear...

609
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,880
who's having an affair with who!

610
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,400
This can actually kill
your love for movies.

611
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,600
You love movies?

612
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,600
Love?

613
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,600
No films means 'the end' for her!

614
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,480
That's why this house is
right next to a film studio.

615
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,400
House? Look at this hole!

616
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,320
We need cinema to feel alive.

617
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:30,360
Life is so dead, flat, boring, ugly...

618
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,920
Light never falls perfectly on the face.

619
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,040
Look at the moon,

620
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,800
it looks gorgeous only on screen,
with music.

621
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,320
Where? Where is the music?

622
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,400
The background score of our lives...

623
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,760
incessant honking...

624
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,120
The sound of violins
have to be imagined at funerals,

625
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,360
to feel the sorrow.

626
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,400
I mean, even falling in love...

627
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,120
You know when I think
I'll really fall in love?

628
00:44:58,840 --> 00:44:59,920
When?

629
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:04,560
When someone actually walks towards me
in slow motion...

630
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,320
You should make a film.

631
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,400
No way.

632
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,720
I can watch 500 films in the time
it takes to make one.

633
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,840
What joy...

634
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,720
It's the best job ever...

635
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,520
earning a living doing
what you love most...

636
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,600
just watch movies!

637
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,000
That's why my dream is to be a critic.

638
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,040
Are you okay?

639
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,880
Hearing 'critic' made you choke?

640
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,440
I understand.
What's happening is so crazy.

641
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,480
- Three critics, one after the other...
- Yeah, crazy.

642
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,360
Excuse me.

643
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,720
Vaishnavi, Richa, Nila, Rohit,
you all should be embarrassed.

644
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,760
Tomorrow is Guru Dutt's
94th birth anniversary,

645
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,880
you should be ashamed you didn't know.

646
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,560
I want an 800 word article.

647
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,400
You guys figure it out between
yourselves who is going to do it.

648
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,600
I want it by 2 a.m. tonight!

649
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,160
Shit!

650
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,640
It is Guru Dutt's birth anniversary.

651
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:09,880
What a filmmaker!

652
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,560
I want to write this.
I really want to write this.

653
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,600
Anyway, thank you for the thundering idlis

654
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:19,560
and no rain, yet... I'll go.

655
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,080
But why?

656
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,160
Because this is real life
and you need to work.

657
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:27,680
If it were a film, I would've
been reading your article by now.

658
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,520
Bye, ma'am. Thank you.

659
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,680
See you soon.

660
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,480
What's going on?

661
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,240
What?

662
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,960
He may be cute but... a flower-seller?

663
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,000
If a mother has expensive taste,

664
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,560
a daughter has to do such things.

665
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,680
You're so ungrateful.

666
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:56,680
Also...

667
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,560
a person who spends
all his life with flowers,

668
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,160
has a fragrance that's unmatched.

669
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,640
Make sure your life doesn't end up without
fragrance like these 'Kaagaz Ke Phool' (Paper Flowers).

670
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,240
On Guru Dutt's birthday...

671
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,840
'Kaagaz Ke Phool' (Paper Flowers)

672
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,560
<i>♪ Life inflicts... ♪</i>

673
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,600
<i>♪ ...such sweet pain ♪</i>

674
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:32,000
<i>♪ You are no longer you ♪</i>

675
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,760
<i>♪ I am no longer me ♪</i>

676
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,080
Great piece, Nila.

677
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:04,640
Can't believe someone so young can
write so passionately about Guru Dutt.

678
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,520
- Thank you, sir.
- Beautiful.

679
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,040
Thank you, thank you.

680
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:09,800
He liked it.

681
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:15,040
- Hello, sir.
- Hi. Nice piece.

682
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,120
Thank you.

683
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,280
Lucky you. You got to write
on Guru Dutt.

684
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:23,000
I have to write about
'Kalinga - the war is not over'.

685
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,000
- Have you watched it?
- The press show is this evening.

686
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,600
But I do not feel like going.

687
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,720
- Why?
- What's the point?

688
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,080
'No negative comments... be careful...'

689
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,360
The police should write these reviews.

690
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:36,640
Right.

691
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,400
It's not about the film anymore.

692
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,560
Thank your stars
you're not a film critic at this time.

693
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,040
Do the police have any clue
about the killer?

694
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,400
I wouldn't know.

695
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,320
Our investigative journalists
must be facing this everyday, right?

696
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:56,880
They cover political scandals,
business scams, underworld exposés...

697
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,880
so many psychos must be after
their blood.

698
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,080
I wonder how they carry on writing.

699
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,000
Four and a half stars - Mallika Bhonsle.

700
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,640
Five stars - Ashwin Banerjee.

701
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,720
'The film is so good... Wow!'

702
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:19,320
'Great songs, action, performance,
direction... four awards guaranteed.'

703
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,880
'A director who doesn't just make
grand historical films

704
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:23,840
but creates history.'

705
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,920
'Every frame of the film
is like a painting.'

706
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,520
- 'Four stars.'
- 'Five stars.'

707
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,680
- 'Five stars.'
- 'Five stars.'

708
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,360
'I'm going with five stars.'

709
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,560
'Pandey's View gives 'Kalinga'
four and a half stars!'

710
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:37,800
One and a half stars.

711
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:38,920
One and a half? Who?

712
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:40,640
Shit!

713
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,920
- Secure the whole area.
- Let's move.

714
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,480
I am going to Dehradun with the kids.

715
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:59,160
- Reshma...
- Kartik, I cannot live like this anymore.

716
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,600
Like a terrorist attack
is about to happen!

717
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,880
The whole building is terrified.

718
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,360
I'll just...

719
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,080
Such a critical situation...

720
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,680
and he has given
one and a half stars!

721
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,400
This fellow has made our lives hell.

722
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,360
Everyone is giving four and five stars...

723
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:38,320
What's his problem? As if there'll be
a shortage of stars in the sky.

724
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:39,920
Sorry, sir.

725
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:44,040
I love journalism and I love cinema.

726
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:47,200
I'd be betraying both
if I lied about the film.

727
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:50,480
I'll never be able
to face myself again, sir.

728
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,400
- Because of me, the police--
- Do you watch all films?

729
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,440
Yes, sir. As many as I can.

730
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:00,560
How do you do it?
I don't have the patience.

731
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,680
Have you watched all psychopath films?

732
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,720
You think this is inspired by some film?

733
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:12,040
You know, like a copycat killer. Right?

734
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:17,160
Yes... but to the best of my knowledge,
there is no such film.

735
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,520
Because of me, the police are...

736
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,400
I am really sorry.

737
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:25,480
No, no.

738
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:29,360
Your ethics may actually help us here.

739
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,440
At least the target is clear...

740
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,560
- Yes, Nila?
- Hats off to you, sir.

741
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,040
The film is rubbish.
You were absolutely bang on.

742
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,240
Which building? What's that parcel?

743
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,600
That building is on the other side.

744
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,840
♪ If your head reels ♪

745
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,440

746
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,480

♪ Why worry? ♪

749
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,280
Four and a half stars.

750
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:24,600
You thought you'll get away?

751
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:27,320
Govind Pandey - 'Pandey's View'.

752
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:29,560
Want to know my view?

753
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,320
What's good is good,

754
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,920
what's bad is bad!

755
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:33,840
Simple.

756
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,360
You will get a chance.

757
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:43,400
You talk so much every week.

758
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:44,920
Let others talk for once.

759
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,160
Where was I?

760
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,360
You read the review
and went to watch the film.

761
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,000
After reading your review,
I went to see the film.

762
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,960
I saw the film. What did you see?

763
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,640
Horses?

764
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,240
Jewellery?

765
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,080
Songs?

766
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,280
Let's discuss this.

767
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:13,960
This is a very special film.

768
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,680
It requires a special talent
to waste so much money

769
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,080
and make such a fool of the audience.

770
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:23,680
It's the worst film I've seen in years.

771
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:25,880
You liked it?

772
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:28,920
Don't lie.

773
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:34,320
You never give less than four stars
to any of this producer's films.

774
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,640
What did he give you?

775
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:39,080
A gold watch?

776
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,680
Or a designer bag for your wife?

777
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,320
Or a 3-day 4-night holiday in Thailand?

778
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:51,880
Huh?

779
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,320
The film is a hit?

780
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:54,920
The audience likes the film?

781
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,640
Then let the audience speak.
Why are you needed?

782
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:09,680
If the audience wants to be fooled,
it's their choice.

783
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,040
Why are you helping them to be fools?

784
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,560
Open the eyes of the audience.

785
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,720
Upgrade their tastes.

786
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,440
Improve the quality of entertainment.

787
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,160
It's your bloody job!

788
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:29,800
'Kalinga is a brilliant film.'

789
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:33,120
'Every frame of the film
is like a painting.'

790
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:15,720
Pandey...

791
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:19,080
this is what is called
a beautiful painting.

792
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:26,560
I give it four and a half stars.

793
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,560
Who is the artist?

794
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,600
Touch my feet.

795
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:43,800
Cut!

796
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,480
It's the fourth murder...

797
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,080
Sir...

798
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,680
The fire forced the guard
to turn off the main switch.

799
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,840
Automatically, the alarms, cameras and
the security system got deactivated.

800
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:30,840
We have just three weeks, Arvind.

801
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,880
The CBI will take over the case
after that.

802
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,400
It's the Home Minister's decision.

803
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,240
I can't do much about it.

804
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,240
The media is on a protest.

805
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:41,920
'Outside the Crime Branch building

806
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:45,360
a peaceful candle march
is being held by the critics.'

807
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,600
'The Critics Guild of India has decided,

808
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,960
till the police assures them of security,

809
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:54,480
no critic will write film reviews
for any newspaper, website or channel.'

810
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:57,160
- I can't believe this!
- What a useless protest!

811
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:00,640
Millions of people post their reviews
after every film.

812
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:04,120
What difference will it make if these
'official' critics write or don't write.

813
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,000
It does make a difference.

814
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:08,320
Official makes a difference.

815
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,040
It has the stamp of credibility.

816
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:14,160
A professional movie expert
who knows cinema.

817
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:17,200
That's why people wait
for these reviews...

818
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,440
and trust these 'official critics'.

819
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:26,320
I write a review after watching every film,
but don't post it...

820
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:30,560
because even my 72 followers
won't see it as an 'official' review.

821
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,800
'In this film studio,
many films have been made...

822
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,760
are being made and will be made.'

823
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:53,720
'But this studio has not changed

824
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:56,320
nor has its ambience.'

825
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,640
'Everything is the same...

826
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:02,160
only the film changes

827
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:05,160
and the filmmakers change.'

828
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:16,880
<i>♪ I have seen a world full of friends ♪</i>

829
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:28,200
<i>♪ They all part, one by one ♪</i>

830
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:31,880
''Kaagaz Ke Phool' is an
utterly undistinguished picture.'

831
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,800
'An incoherent slow tale, boringly told.'

832
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:47,160
''Kaagaz Ke Phool'
is a negative picture...'

833
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:54,920
'...weak script'

834
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,480
'...weak performances'

835
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:03,560
'...scrappy editing.'

836
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:19,600
The genius maker of 'Paper Flowers'
was silenced by the mediocre critics.

837
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:26,880
Stop... right here.

838
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:35,000
Hello.

839
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,600
Hello...

840
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:41,720
Hello...

841
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:43,360
Hello...

842
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:48,000
Sorry. I was in the washroom.

843
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,160
You okay?

844
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,400
- No.
- What's wrong?

845
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:03,200
If you desperately want to do something
but don't get a chance...

846
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:07,360
and the ones who've got the chance
are wasting it...

847
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:09,680
what would you do?

848
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:11,240
I'd say 'thank you'.

849
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,200
'Thank you'?

850
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:16,480
When somebody makes you
want to be like them

851
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:17,400
beware!

852
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,440
Our originality dies.

853
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:23,920
When somebody makes you
not want to be like them,

854
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:26,080
we should thank them.

855
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:29,640
We become original only
when we learn what not to be.

856
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:33,640
- What profound advice!
- Huh?

857
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:38,680
Sorry. But what is this chance
that you wouldn't waste?

858
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:40,080
What are you?

859
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,720
I mean, apart from being
a crazy Guru Dutt fan?

860
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,560
Guru Dutt?
What Guru Dutt?

861
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,040
Why are you pretending?

862
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,120
What do you mean? I'm confused.

863
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,600
Didn't you make those paper flowers

864
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,480
specially for Guru Dutt's birthday?

865
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:56,760
Like a tribute?

866
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,480
I made them for you.

867
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:01,960
You told me that it was
some Guru Dutt's birthday.

868
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,240
And what is the connection
between that and paper flowers?

869
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,240
'Paper flowers'?

870
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:10,960
'Kaagaz Ke Phool (Paper Flowers)'
was Guru Dutt's last film.

871
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,320
Don't know?

872
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:16,200
Wow! You've made a simple coincidence
seem so profound.

873
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,280
Almost like a film scene.

874
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,280
You really do love cinema.

875
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:28,920
Are you sure?

876
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:31,120
You're not pulling my leg?

877
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:33,680
Guru Dutt...

878
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:35,920
'Kaagaz Ke Phool'...
not watched it?

879
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,600
No, no...

880
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:40,320
Forget reality.

881
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:43,400
Reality is boring.
I am a Guru Dutt fan.

882
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,360
I am a Guru Dutt fan!

883
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:47,600
A fan that makes paper flowers.

884
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:50,240
You feel better now?
Do you like me better?

885
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,320
Is the lighting okay?

886
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,720
I hate tube lights.

887
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:04,720
- You are mad!
- Mad is fine.

888
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,640
As long as I'm not flat and ugly.

889
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,440
Should I play some music?

890
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:26,120
<i>♪ Who knows what you said? ♪</i>

891
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:29,920
<i>♪ Who knows what I heard? ♪</i>

892
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,760
<i>♪ Something stirred in my heart ♪</i>

893
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:16,840
<i>♪ I trembled with joy ♪</i>

894
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:20,520
<i>♪ I quivered with excitement ♪</i>

895
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:32,120
<i>♪ My dreams reawakened ♪</i>

896
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:34,840
<i>♪ Something stirred in my heart ♪</i>

897
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:39,320
Sir, the forensic report is ready.

898
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:40,480
Do you like sports?

899
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:41,960
Er... yes, sir.

900
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:43,640
Which sport do you play?

901
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:44,400
Cricket.

902
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:45,760
And?

903
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:47,160
Football.

904
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:48,200
And?

905
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:50,480
Er... bad--badminton.

906
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:51,720
And?

907
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,040
Sir... I play tennis too, sometimes.

908
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:56,480
I play just one sport...

909
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:58,840
and I've never lost a game.

910
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:00,400
What do they think?

911
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:04,080
The CBI will play on my ground
while I watch from the sidelines?

912
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,680
We're doing something wrong.

913
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:13,400
Strategy is wrong.

914
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:15,360
Sir, don't...

915
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,480
Sir... Please, sir. Don't...

916
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:21,800
It's loaded!

917
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:23,280
The gun, sir.

918
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:28,240
To catch a psychopath
think like one.

919
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:36,560
- Hello?
- Rosy's mother passed away.

920
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:39,520
Many people came to the funeral,
to offer their condolences.

921
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:43,640
Rosy noticed a handsome man there...

922
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
it was love at first sight.

923
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:46,880
He offered his condolences and left.

924
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:49,480
Rosy asked everyone
but nobody knew the man.

925
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:53,960
Rosy searched for him... everywhere.

926
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:56,280
But she didn't find him.

927
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:59,800
One day, Rosy killed her sister...

928
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:01,960
Why?

929
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:06,120
Rosy felt that the man would return,
to offer condolences.

930
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:11,360
After all these years, why are you
asking me such stupid questions?

931
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,760
Just explaining what thinking
like a psychopath means.

932
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:20,160
Sir, meet Dr. Zenobia Shroff.

933
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:21,160
- Pleasure.
- Pleasure.

934
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:22,440
Criminal psychologist

935
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:25,040
and a leading member
of the Psychopath Society.

936
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:26,880
Not the Psychopath Society,

937
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:31,640
the Society of Scientific
Study of Psychopathy - SSSP.

938
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,720
Basically, she understands
how the minds of serial killers work.

939
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:37,360
I gave her a call.

940
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:40,480
Surprise... she was on vacation,

941
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,280
in Pune... on a spiritual holiday!

942
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:44,000
Please have a seat.

943
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:45,880
Thank you for saving me.

944
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:48,840
Too much silence. I was going quite mad.

945
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:51,080
I'm a Bollywood buff.

946
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,920
A psychopath in Bollywood...

947
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:56,800
can't be more tempting.

948
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:59,520
- So the killer is taking a break?
- Looks like it.

949
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:01,280
No reviews, no murder.

950
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:04,160
That is exactly what he wants.

951
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:05,920
He must be jumping with joy.

952
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,360
At least you said, it's a 'he'.

953
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:10,360
We have no proof of even that.

954
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,400
That's my job.

955
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:14,880
To prove something without any proof.

956
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:18,000
83% serial killers are men.

957
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:21,920
That doesn't mean this person
isn't from the 17%.

958
01:08:22,390 --> 01:08:26,920
It could be a big-built, strong woman
who can carry a man on her shoulders

959
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:28,840
and fling him on a railway track.

960
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:31,430
But look at Nitin Srivastav.

961
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:35,520
I mean, can you even
look at Nitin Srivastav?

962
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:39,600
Don't mean to be insensitive,
nor do I mean to body shame...

963
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:44,600
But even the most disturbed woman...

964
01:08:46,310 --> 01:08:52,040
will not enjoy making designer cuts
on such an attractive nude body...

965
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:56,430
she would at least cover the paunch
with a towel!

966
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:59,680
So in my expert opinion,

967
01:09:00,430 --> 01:09:02,640
only a man would not be disgusted.

968
01:09:05,470 --> 01:09:06,720
Caught you!

969
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:09,470
Let's catch him.

970
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:25,840
When our 'Guru' is so sad,
why are you smiling?

971
01:09:27,350 --> 01:09:28,600
Tell me.

972
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:31,120
Tell me.

973
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:36,760
Stop. Stop it.

974
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,040
Stop it. Stop!

975
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,080
Stop. Stop!

976
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:45,240
He has taught us
not to be like him.

977
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:51,680
He is a true teacher,
he taught us to be original.

978
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,440
Why hasn't anyone made
a biopic on him yet?

979
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,600
Biopic! Let's make a biopic.

980
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:01,480
Not his, ours.

981
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:03,240
Another one?

982
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:06,000
Not one... a series.

983
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:09,000
A web series that goes on
season after season.

984
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,840
I'm serious. See this.

985
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:14,760
The storyboard is also ready.

986
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:16,480
Episode 1...

987
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,240
Please close the door.

988
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:25,000
A film is a director's baby.

989
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,760
How can you molest someone's child?

990
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:30,120
Bloody paedophile.

991
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:31,560
One star?

992
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:35,120
'General audience will not understand.
Will not work.'

993
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:36,480
I am the general audience...

994
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:39,360
I go around on a cycle.
I really liked the film.

995
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,880
Did you review the film or my cycle?

996
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,560
Will it run, will it not?

997
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:46,120
The business a film does
is not your business.

998
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:49,880
Your business is to feel the film,

999
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,280
make people aware of its layers,

1000
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,680
lovingly examine its beauty and flaws.

1001
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,280
Someone's life is in your hands.

1002
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:00,720
You write such long reviews but...

1003
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:03,960
'Film should have been cut ruthlessly'?

1004
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,400
How's the edit?

1005
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:18,360
It's the first cut!

1006
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:25,280
One star...

1007
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,560
First half on track.

1008
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:07,240
Mr. Irshad, what problem
did you have with the second half?

1009
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:09,960
If the film kept going
on a predictable track,

1010
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:13,240
everyone would know, after Vasai station
comes Nallasopara then Virar.

1011
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:15,040
But imagine,

1012
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:19,840
after Nallasopara if suddenly
Churchgate station appeared?

1013
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:21,880
Isn't that interesting?

1014
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:25,680
There's time.

1015
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:29,680
When a filmmaker is trying
to change the track of cinema

1016
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,120
why are you waving the red flag?

1017
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:39,440
To create something new,
we must destroy the old.

1018
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:52,320
In a web series, how will you say
first half and second half?

1019
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,800
- Why were only these four targeted?
- Excuse me?

1020
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:07,560
The four critics were killed
according to their reviews, right?

1021
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:11,280
Why were only these four targeted?

1022
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,160
Why did he choose these reviews?

1023
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:15,000
What do you mean?

1024
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:17,280
Prabhu had given the film
one and a half stars,

1025
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:21,080
but three other critics had given
the same film one star.

1026
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:23,080
Why weren't they targeted?

1027
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:25,440
Pandey had given the film
four and a half stars

1028
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,120
but four others had given five stars.

1029
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:28,440
And look at this!

1030
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:32,880
Not just Nitin, two other critics
had given the film one star.

1031
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:36,360
They weren't harmed. Why?

1032
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:42,880
Because all the other reviews were dull!

1033
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:45,600
They were boring.

1034
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:53,080
Only these four gave him
an interesting script in their reviews.

1035
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:54,560
Script?

1036
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,760
Heart is in the right place.

1037
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:00,160
Your heart will be in place.

1038
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:00,840
Don't worry.

1039
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,960
But all other organs
are all over the place.

1040
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:06,760
What a scene you can picture
reading the lines!

1041
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:08,880
What a killer script!

1042
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:11,560
Liver - forward short leg.

1043
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:13,160
No. Silly point.

1044
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:15,280
Kidneys - first slip, second slip.

1045
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:16,760
Small intestine - gully.

1046
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,240
Large intestine - cover.

1047
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:20,160
Pancreas - mid-off.

1048
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:22,600
At fine leg....

1049
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:29,120
What are the organs of a film?

1050
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:33,080
What a meaningless review
of such a meaningful film.

1051
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:37,680
Mr. Bachchan is doing so many
experimental films these days...

1052
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:40,760
what if he gets depressed and retires?

1053
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:43,560
How will cinema progress

1054
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:46,880
without Mr. Bachchan?

1055
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:50,120
Once upon a time,
there was a film director

1056
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:54,240
who is again searching
for a good script...

1057
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:57,440
to direct murders!

1058
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:00,960
For the best movie experience

1059
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:03,680
mobile phones and some critics

1060
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:05,880
should be silent.

1061
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,080
This is crazy.

1062
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:12,440
Critics must have finished his career
years ago and--

1063
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,920
But this just doesn't make sense.

1064
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:18,960
If his film was criticised
many years ago,

1065
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,600
why is he killing now
for other films?

1066
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:25,040
Is this psychopath expecting an award?

1067
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:29,320
Serial killers can be broadly classified
into four categories -

1068
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:33,520
this type is the 'mission-oriented killer'.

1069
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:36,360
To justify their violence,

1070
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,600
they come up with a 'noble mission'
in their heads...

1071
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:42,280
a cause.

1072
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:47,160
Sometimes it takes years for this
trauma to become a 'mission'.

1073
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:51,120
I hope you're right, Dr. Shroff.

1074
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:52,840
I know I'm right, sir.

1075
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:56,400
Their logic is very twisted.

1076
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:59,320
They don't think
they are killers or villains.

1077
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:00,720
They think they're heroes.

1078
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:03,880
Pandey is the clue.
Have you watched 'Kalinga'?

1079
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:07,840
Pandey gave the film four and a half stars
that's why he killed him.

1080
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:12,480
Because he believes,
false praise also harms cinema...

1081
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:14,440
Just like 'Save the Girl Child',

1082
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:15,400
'Save Cows',

1083
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:16,440
'Save Power',

1084
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:18,520
this psychopath's mission is

1085
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:20,120
'Save Cinema'.

1086
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:28,120
What are you doing?

1087
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:29,080
Chopping.

1088
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:30,320
Who?

1089
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:31,320
Chopping my hair.

1090
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:34,760
How can you be so cruel?

1091
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:36,560
Poor things...

1092
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:39,040
They are alive. They grow!

1093
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:40,240
Don't cut.

1094
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:42,160
I think you look very cool
with long hair.

1095
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:42,920
Stop. Stop.

1096
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:45,680
They are alive,
how can you chop them off?

1097
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:48,560
- I want to meet you now.
- Who's stopping you?

1098
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:51,080
I have these bloody deadlines today.

1099
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:52,680
What are you doing tomorrow?

1100
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:56,160
Nothing. I'm free.

1101
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:23,320
<i>♪ I have lost my heart ♪</i>

1102
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:28,360

<i>♪ Is my very own blood ♪</i>

1113
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:42,880
Hey, this is the art gallery
where the murder happened.

1114
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:46,640
- What murder?
- You didn't see it on the news?

1115
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:49,960
The critic's... painting...
It was gruesome.

1116
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:57,080
Nila means?

1117
01:18:58,240 --> 01:18:59,880
I'm talking about murders

1118
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,120
and you're asking me about the moon?

1119
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:05,200
Nila means moon, in Tamil.
Mom is Tamil.

1120
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:08,960
Oh, I thought it was Neela...
like 'blue' in Hindi.

1121
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:18,360
Neela?

1122
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:20,160
Blue?

1123
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:26,160
<i>♪ Your lips are like daggers ♪</i>

1124
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:29,960

1125

<i>♪ Wounding me like a weapon ♪</i>

1128
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:44,680
<i>♪ Flailing and floundering ♪</i>

1129
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:47,920
<i>♪ I have lost my heart and surrendered ♪</i>

1130
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:54,280
<i>♪ It's bliss to lose myself ♪</i>

1131
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:57,000
The loo is inside?

1132
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:04,440
Again?

1133
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:07,560
This was the Intermission. Second half?

1134
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:29,000
We need a list

1135
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:32,880
of all the filmmakers whose last film
was trashed by the critics.

1136
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:35,480
There must be thousands of them.

1137
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,920
This cellophane paper is ten years old.

1138
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:39,840
So something has happened ten years ago.

1139
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,680
Let's start with the last 10-12 years.

1140
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:44,160
I think I know somebody who can help us.
Let's try.

1141
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:49,440
It's funny...

1142
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:53,960
here I am writing a book
'One Hit wonders of Bollywood'.

1143
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:57,040
About actors who disappeared
after one hit film.

1144
01:20:57,320 --> 01:21:00,160
And you want to know about directors
who disappeared after directing a flop film.

1145
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:01,360
Not just flop,

1146
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:03,480
but whose last film
was also heavily criticised.

1147
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,320
The first name that comes to mind
is Guru Dutt.

1148
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:10,400
But I understand you want names
from the last 12 years.

1149
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:11,920
- Guru Dutt?
- Yes.

1150
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:14,080
'Kaagaz Ke Phool'.

1151
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:18,040
His best and most personal film
was trashed by critics.

1152
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:21,640
He didn't make films after that.

1153
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:25,640
He died a few years later...
a broken and depressed man.

1154
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:29,760
Today the same film is considered
a masterpiece.

1155
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:31,720
A film truly ahead of its time.

1156
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:34,800
Damn! You critics are killers.

1157
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:38,920
But, ma'am, I'm just curious...

1158
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:44,320
depression in artists
leads to alcohol, drugs

1159
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:46,440
and even suicide...

1160
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:47,840
I can understand but--

1161
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:51,640
Depression doesn't always
lead to self-harm.

1162
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:56,480
External violence is also a manifestation
of deep inner turmoil and disturbance.

1163
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:00,440
Your seniors were very lucky

1164
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:02,920
that Guru Dutt harmed only himself.

1165
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:08,080
I guess I have a lot of research to do.

1166
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:09,480
Kartik,

1167
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,240
is there someone who can assist you?

1168
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:15,000
Someone who has the
knowledge of films like you.

1169
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:16,520
We don't have much time.

1170
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:27,960
Are you a florist or Pablo Escobar?

1171
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:30,920
You grow marijuana, right?

1172
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:33,440
Such a big house in posh Bandra... how?

1173
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:36,720
Advantage of being born into
a Catholic family in Bandra.

1174
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:39,960
70 years ago, my grandfather
got it cheap because he was Catholic.

1175
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:42,920
Now I struggle to pay the electricity bill
by selling flowers.

1176
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:45,880
One minute, I have something for you.

1177
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:08,560
You're thinking about my mother now?

1178
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,040
For you.

1179
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:13,160
Thank you.

1180
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:18,240
Look at that, what a lovely scene.
Father watching a film.

1181
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:22,360
Hey, was it your father or grandfather?

1182
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:24,840
Someone in your family
was a filmmaker, right?

1183
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:27,880
Shit!

1184
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:30,360
You saw those film cans!

1185
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:32,600
That was supposed to be a surprise.

1186
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:33,440
What surprise?

1187
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:35,400
If I tell you, how will it be a surprise.

1188
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:41,080
Idiot! Idiot!

1189
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:42,600
Why did you let her come inside?

1190
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,840
She saw the film cans.

1191
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:45,200
Yes, she did.

1192
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,320
What to do? I handled it.

1193
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:48,680
Rubbish, you handled it.

1194
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:50,040
We can't take a chance.

1195
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:51,760
She can turn up any time.

1196
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:53,080
Shift all the cans down.

1197
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:35,120
And cut!

1198
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:38,040
Was it okay?

1199
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:39,280
I'm proud of you.

1200
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:49,320
Where are the leaves on the poster?

1201
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:50,640
What leaves, Mom?

1202
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:52,760
The ones that are like brackets.

1203
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:54,320
'Best Film of the Year.'

1204
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:56,040
'Winner of 10 Oscars.'

1205
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:59,160
Medals are awarded
after you win a race.

1206
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:00,440
You should put them now.

1207
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:03,440
Best! Best! Best!
Print the leaves.

1208
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:22,160
'A dismal debut.'

1209
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:25,880
'A slow, depressing film.'

1210
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:28,320
'A headache-inducing story.'

1211
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:32,160
'Where is the film in this film?'

1212
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:37,400
Your film is the best film.

1213
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:42,280
You are the best director.

1214
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:46,120
You are the best.

1215
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:48,840
The best.

1216
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:51,720
The best.

1217
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:53,680
Coming soon.

1218
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:56,680
How? Everyone has shut up.

1219
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:58,760
For how long?

1220
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:35,120
We have found 216 directors so far.

1221
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,320
Whatever reviews we could find are here.

1222
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:39,160
This is the first time I'm hearing
of some of these films.

1223
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:42,840
Many Wikipedia pages and photos
are missing.

1224
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:46,200
I've even checked with
the Directors Association,

1225
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:47,920
half these people are
not even registered.

1226
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:49,880
It's as if they never even existed.

1227
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:52,480
- Hi, I'm Nila.
- Zenobia.

1228
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:55,720
It will be tough to find
and interrogate 216 people.

1229
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:57,520
Yeah, but it's not impossible.

1230
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:01,480
Arushi Kanakia, Akash Gulati...
what about Sebastian Gomes?

1231
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:02,720
Rajesh Batra...

1232
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:03,880
Whose birthday?

1233
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,800
It's Moushumi Aunty's anniversary today.

1234
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,360
I'm going to give her this cake
and wish her.

1235
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:08,640
Hold on.

1236
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,160
Where did you get this?

1237
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:11,960
I baked it.

1238
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:14,280
Not the cake.
This cellophane paper.

1239
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,040
I don't know.
It was lying around at home.

1240
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:17,560
It must have come from somewhere...

1241
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:19,480
I think... yes!

1242
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:22,800
The day of Govind Pandey's murder,
after you left,

1243
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:24,400
a bouquet arrived.

1244
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:28,360
It was left at the door.

1245
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:31,400
There was a 'Thank you' note,
without a name.

1246
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:34,240
This bouquet was sent to you
by the killer!

1247
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:39,480
I want the footage from that day.

1248
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:46,960
This is Kinu, Malhotra's son.
Apartment number D-45.

1249
01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:59,800
He was wearing dark glasses
and a hoodie.

1250
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:11,240
This bouquet was sent to you
by the killer!

1251
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:16,120
You know how dangerous plastic is?

1252
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:25,200
On Guru Dutt's birthday... paper flowers?

1253
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,560
Guru Dutt?
What Guru Dutt?

1254
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:35,400
Hearing 'critic' made you choke?

1255
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:44,240
Oh, poisoning her own husband?

1256
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:54,600
- Tired?
- Yes, good night.

1257
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:56,480
Your boyfriend was here.

1258
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:58,200
Danny came here?

1259
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:01,000
He's Catholic, maybe I should say Romeo.

1260
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:02,320
When? Why?

1261
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:04,040
Why are you panicking?

1262
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:06,160
He came to take me out on a date.

1263
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:07,600
I said,

1264
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:09,000
'Waste of time...

1265
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:11,040
the entire city looks the same to me.'

1266
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:13,640
Heartbroken,

1267
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:19,400
he left you the gift
that he had actually got for me...

1268
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:50,280
Surprise!

1269
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:52,480
I grew flowers in a film can

1270
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:55,720
hoping the florist appears
in your film like dream.

1271
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:07,720
What happened?

1272
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:11,560
Mom, I'm so stupid.

1273
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:15,000
How could I be so stupid?

1274
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:19,680
Bought the cans from a junk shop,
got the idea from the internet.

1275
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:21,160
The poem is original.

1276
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:23,680
It's... so beautiful.

1277
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:26,960
I tried growing them in many cans,
only one was a success.

1278
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:28,480
What are you doing?

1279
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:30,440
What are you doing?

1280
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:32,080
I'm waiting for Blue - part two.

1281
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:36,440
Thursday. I have my periods.

1282
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:38,840
Sir, I know I have just one week.

1283
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:41,880
There are suspects...
216 suspects, sir.

1284
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:44,600
I need time, try and understand--

1285
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:48,160
Sorry, sir.

1286
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:50,240
Okay, sir.

1287
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:53,440
I feel like killing somebody.

1288
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:55,280
Criticism is turning everyone
into killers.

1289
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:56,600
God save the world!

1290
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:59,640
Will the threat of CBI taking over the case
make the killer give himself up?

1291
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:00,880
Quiet, Arvind.

1292
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:03,880
I am hunting for clues in the reviews
Kartik has compiled.

1293
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,880
We will all be reviewed in a week.

1294
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,600
Let's see if we have any stars left.

1295
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:12,120
Star!

1296
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:14,680
Zenobia, stars!

1297
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:16,920
'We' should be giving stars!

1298
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:20,080
'We' should write reviews not read.

1299
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:25,040
It's just a film review.

1300
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:27,120
It's just a-just a...

1301
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:30,000
Yeah, listen, there's nothing to...

1302
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:31,520
Nonsense!

1303
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:34,600
Not one critic is ready.
Everyone is scared.

1304
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:37,040
Sorry, Nikhil. I can't do this.

1305
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:40,840
I promised Reshma,
I can't do this to her.

1306
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:43,240
I can't put my family
through another trauma.

1307
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:46,320
Sorry, Arvind sir.
I'm done with this.

1308
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:48,080
Please excuse me.

1309
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:54,120
I'm... I'm sorry, sir.

1310
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:57,960
What if we use a fake name?

1311
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:00,080
A fake name won't work.

1312
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:01,920
You are damn yum!

1313
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:03,680
And?

1314
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:04,880
And damn hot.

1315
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:06,400
And?

1316
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:08,400
And damn cool.

1317
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:10,360
And?

1318
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:12,960
And I'm in the office!
Rest on Thursday night.

1319
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:14,720
And?

1320
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:17,480
If you're lucky,
then Friday morning too!

1321
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:20,720
Nila?

1322
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:22,320
Oh! I'll call you back. Okay bye.

1323
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:25,080
Hi, sir. You are here?

1324
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:26,160
You know her?

1325
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:27,880
Do you need some other help, sir?

1326
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:29,280
Yeah.

1327
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:31,120
I need a critic.

1328
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:50,440
Mom...

1329
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:53,160
Mom, wake up.

1330
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:55,120
What happened?

1331
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:59,200
I was seeing such a nice dream.

1332
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:04,080
What's wrong, huh?

1333
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:21,360
Mom...

1334
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:24,400
Where are you going?

1335
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:43,080
You were 11...

1336
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,800
Your school had taken you
to watch 'Lion King'.

1337
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:51,120
You came home and wrote
your first review.

1338
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:54,800
And I saw the film
as you read it to me.

1339
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:57,840
The light is on. Read it...

1340
01:33:58,640 --> 01:33:59,800
Read.

1341
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:04,320
I knew then...

1342
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:07,400
you will be a great critic.

1343
01:34:09,680 --> 01:34:11,160
I said 'yes' bravely.

1344
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:15,080
Thought I'm getting a chance
to make a difference...

1345
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:16,920
But now I'm a little...

1346
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:19,840
This police order...

1347
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:24,760
I can't talk to anyone and it's just...

1348
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:28,280
I wish I could speak to Danny.

1349
01:34:28,680 --> 01:34:30,640
He would have sorted out my head.

1350
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:35,600
To be a lion in life,

1351
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:39,600
you need to have more courage
than a sheep.

1352
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:45,520
What kind of a mother are you?

1353
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:48,560
So willing to sacrifice
your daughter, huh?

1354
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:52,240
If anything happens to me,
will you manage on your own?

1355
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:59,400
I am proud of you, Nila.

1356
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:01,280
Proud of you.

1357
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:06,800
How are you, Danny?

1358
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:08,440
Long time...

1359
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:10,520
Danny's special scrambled eggs,
two portions.

1360
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:15,400
The joy of breaking a fast.

1361
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:17,200
Why shout? I'm right here.

1362
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:27,920
Sir, after the Mumbai Post article,

1363
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:29,440
everyone wants to publish
reviews on Friday.

1364
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:30,640
Media war.

1365
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:32,520
Scared that Mumbai Post
will grab their audience.

1366
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:34,240
It'll look real if everyone reviews.

1367
01:35:34,360 --> 01:35:36,160
Security for everyone?

1368
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:37,520
Not everyone... just four.

1369
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:39,280
Tell the others to write
at their own risk.

1370
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:41,000
They will be too scared to write.

1371
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:45,160
Our 'filmmaker' should not find
a good script in any of the reviews,

1372
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:46,600
except one.

1373
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:49,000
I'm getting nervous, Arvind.

1374
01:35:58,160 --> 01:35:59,920
Ever thought we'd watch a film
under such pressure?

1375
01:36:00,240 --> 01:36:02,760
I'm scared to even rate cab drivers
these days.

1376
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:06,880
All this will make us think about
every word we write.

1377
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,760
What to 'think' in a film
like 'Ding Dong'?

1378
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:11,120
The poster itself is telling us
not to use our brains.

1379
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:12,880
Who's that girl?

1380
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:14,880
Just look at her.

1381
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:17,000
She's so young.

1382
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:20,080
This just doesn't seem right.

1383
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,680
If she was old, would it be right?

1384
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:25,160
She's a brave girl.

1385
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:28,200
She wants to be a brave girl.

1386
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:30,920
She knows the danger...

1387
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:32,920
but the foolish idealism of youth!

1388
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:34,840
And you and me...

1389
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:37,000
we're taking advantage of that.

1390
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:39,520
'Foolish idealism of youth'?

1391
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:42,040
If not for this 'foolish idealism',

1392
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:43,920
no one would be in the army

1393
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:45,160
or the police.

1394
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:49,760
- All set, sir.
- Yeah, let's go.

1395
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:51,200
Let's go.

1396
01:37:00,280 --> 01:37:01,440
Rest on Thursday night.

1397
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:04,640
If you're lucky,
then Friday morning too!

1398
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:20,960
- Did you like the film?
- It was great fun.

1399
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:23,880
It was not stupid at all...
very smart slapstick.

1400
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:26,200
It's been so long
since I've laughed so hard.

1401
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:27,800
Everyone enjoyed it.

1402
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:29,600
Good. Rate it one star.

1403
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:31,640
But why? I loved it.

1404
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:33,560
You loved, I loved it...

1405
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:36,480
the killer will also like it.
So kill it.

1406
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:38,000
No.

1407
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:42,600
Look, Nila, if you don't want
to take the risk, I get it.

1408
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:45,360
Let's just call this off.

1409
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:46,840
But...

1410
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:50,560
this is my first review.
This has been my dream.

1411
01:37:50,680 --> 01:37:52,680
The dream of becoming a critic
will come true

1412
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:55,320
when the nightmare of being a critic ends.

1413
01:37:55,680 --> 01:37:57,880
What about ethics?
This could harm the film.

1414
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,120
Ethics is about doing the right thing.

1415
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:02,000
Now wrong is right!

1416
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:04,720
Do you want to give it five stars?

1417
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:05,680
Not five, but at least...

1418
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:06,440
One!

1419
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:18,480
Something's wrong...

1420
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:20,240
Something's wrong.

1421
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:22,520
Yeah, she dumped you.

1422
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:30,880
Don't be so desperate. Wait.

1423
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:35,520
She disconnected the call.

1424
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:40,520
You called her 16 times
and she disconnects after 3 rings?

1425
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:42,040
For security reasons,

1426
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:44,200
we have to shift your mother from here.

1427
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:45,240
Just for a few days.

1428
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:48,080
We had a date today.
I want to know why she didn't come.

1429
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:49,680
The date is tomorrow.

1430
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:51,200
Our date.

1431
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:52,680
Mom, come here.

1432
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,560
I just finished the review of 'Ding Dong'.

1433
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:47,800
Two tickets.

1434
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:01,440
The security should remain invisible.

1435
01:41:02,040 --> 01:41:04,640
Our 'guest' shouldn't suspect a thing.

1436
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:14,280
Ding-dong, the first review is out!

1437
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:16,000
Nila?

1438
01:41:16,120 --> 01:41:18,200
'Something really urgent came up.
I'm so sorry I missed your calls.'

1439
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:20,040
'Where are you? I need you.'

1440
01:41:21,240 --> 01:41:22,560
Where were you?

1441
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:25,280
You'll have to wait, Nila.

1442
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:29,800
'Ding Dong is a good entertaining film.'

1443
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:31,600
What the hell is happening?

1444
01:41:31,720 --> 01:41:34,120
Why wasn't our review online first?

1445
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:36,560
We announced first.
We had to be the first!

1446
01:41:37,480 --> 01:41:39,320
'...and I am going with three stars.'

1447
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:40,960
'Good entertaining film!'

1448
01:41:41,320 --> 01:41:42,960
Give me something for
my entertainment, madam.

1449
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:45,040
Upload. Next.

1450
01:41:47,120 --> 01:41:49,560
''Ding Dong' is a breezy film.'

1451
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:54,720
'It's not a brilliant masterpiece...
three and a half stars.'

1452
01:41:55,120 --> 01:41:56,320
Come on, give it four stars.

1453
01:41:56,640 --> 01:41:58,040
What are you saving half a star for?

1454
01:41:58,440 --> 01:42:00,880
Okay, go. Next.

1455
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:15,760
'Ding Dong... very wrong!'

1456
01:42:16,280 --> 01:42:17,440
One star?

1457
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:20,080
Who's the critic?

1458
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:21,360
Nila!

1459
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:35,840
Blah blah...

1460
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:39,560
'Writing is bad, jokes are cheap.'

1461
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:47,120
'My head is splitting
into a thousand pieces.'

1462
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:52,080
'Ding Dong is pure torture,

1463
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:55,800
guaranteed to cause brain damage.'

1464
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:59,920
'My advice - save your money
and your brain.

1465
01:43:00,160 --> 01:43:01,400
Stay at home.'

1466
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:16,000
Love you, Nila.

1467
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:18,800
I love you.

1468
01:43:21,080 --> 01:43:23,080
I'm coming home!

1469
01:43:57,200 --> 01:43:58,480
Are you okay?

1470
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:00,000
No.

1471
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:02,720
Don't feel guilty.

1472
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:04,720
The film is a hit.

1473
01:44:04,920 --> 01:44:06,600
Negative or positive reviews
don't make a difference.

1474
01:44:06,720 --> 01:44:08,320
I don't give a damn about the film.

1475
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:09,880
I'm just really missing my mother.

1476
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:15,760
I don't need your phone to speak to her.
Stop it, please.

1477
01:44:17,880 --> 01:44:20,680
It's just for a few days,
she's comfortable and safe...

1478
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:22,560
I can't take this anymore.
I can't, please...

1479
01:44:22,680 --> 01:44:24,400
What am I doing?

1480
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:26,920
I don't want to die.

1481
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,680
We are all here,
no one can touch you.

1482
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:40,480
You have been a brave girl.

1483
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:42,560
I've not been brave,
I've just been stupid!

1484
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:47,280
Just chill now. Relax.

1485
01:44:47,400 --> 01:44:48,800
Chill? Chill?

1486
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:50,200
Are you insane?

1487
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:51,440
It's just hitting me now,

1488
01:44:51,560 --> 01:44:55,440
I'm waiting here for someone
to smash my head,

1489
01:44:55,560 --> 01:44:58,080
because of your stupid script...
into a thousand pieces.

1490
01:44:58,360 --> 01:44:59,880
And you're telling me to chill?

1491
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:00,960
I'm so dumb!

1492
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:21,880
- Try and understand, Nila...
- No, I can't!

1493
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,960
Please, please,
I just want to go meet my Mom.

1494
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:25,760
Sorry, I can't do this.
Please, please...

1495
01:45:25,880 --> 01:45:27,440
I want to go talk to my Mom, please.

1496
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:29,920
Let me go, Arvind sir.
I'm sorry. Please...

1497
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:33,040
Yeah?

1498
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:36,720
Do you know Danny?

1499
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,760
Yes! Please, ask him to come up.

1500
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:41,320
I love him. I want to see him.

1501
01:45:41,440 --> 01:45:43,240
If he really loves you,
he will understand...

1502
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:45,160
- tell him she's sleeping.
- No, please!

1503
01:45:45,640 --> 01:45:47,000
Give him the phone.

1504
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:49,840
Danny, I want to see you.

1505
01:45:49,960 --> 01:45:51,560
Please come up. I am really scared.

1506
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:53,280
Take me away from here.
Please...

1507
01:45:53,400 --> 01:45:56,400
- What's wrong with you?
- Please... I want to see Danny! Please!

1508
01:45:57,960 --> 01:45:58,960
Please!

1509
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:00,280
Okay, five minutes.

1510
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:01,800
Yes, sir?
Okay, sir.

1511
01:46:03,120 --> 01:46:03,880
Are you new here?

1512
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:07,760
- Danny.
- Just hold on.

1513
01:46:40,680 --> 01:46:41,960
You cannot stay here for too long.

1514
01:46:45,080 --> 01:46:46,200
This is madness.

1515
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:47,880
I'm not going to leave.

1516
01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:49,080
That's not your decision.

1517
01:46:51,160 --> 01:46:52,120
Please...

1518
01:46:57,400 --> 01:46:58,680
I think she's stressed out.

1519
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:00,680
If she rests a bit she'll be fine.

1520
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:49,000
How can you do this?

1521
01:47:49,240 --> 01:47:50,080
Do what?

1522
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:52,720
I'm not leaving Nila alone.

1523
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:54,120
Alone?

1524
01:47:54,840 --> 01:47:56,160
Can't you see me?

1525
01:47:56,640 --> 01:47:58,920
It's the job of the police
to protect us from danger

1526
01:47:59,200 --> 01:48:01,160
but you're inviting danger home.

1527
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:03,760
I see you, not the police.

1528
01:48:06,280 --> 01:48:07,960
Don't cops have a heart?

1529
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:09,960
I love Nila.

1530
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:11,840
I can give my life for her.

1531
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:14,080
Let me be here, please.

1532
01:48:14,200 --> 01:48:15,480
I love my job...

1533
01:48:16,280 --> 01:48:18,040
I can take a life for it.

1534
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:22,240
If I listen to my heart,

1535
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:24,120
I will lose focus.

1536
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:30,320
Danny... don't leave me.

1537
01:48:30,440 --> 01:48:31,680
I'm here. I'm here.

1538
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:33,880
It was just a bad dream.

1539
01:49:28,240 --> 01:49:29,360
Thank you.

1540
01:49:29,560 --> 01:49:31,800
I think you should leave now.

1541
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:34,080
Who the fuck are you to tell me to go?

1542
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:43,320
Make sure that he leaves the building.

1543
01:50:05,320 --> 01:50:07,560
Perfect throw... fell on the mark!

1544
01:50:10,240 --> 01:50:11,560
Sorry, the budget is tight.

1545
01:50:11,960 --> 01:50:13,520
It's all I could manage.

1546
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:17,360
Hurry up man, the shot is ready!

1547
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:18,480
Lights!

1548
01:50:21,600 --> 01:50:22,400
Camera!

1549
01:50:24,840 --> 01:50:25,720
Action!

1550
01:50:26,120 --> 01:50:29,080
You know when I think
I'll really fall in love?

1551
01:50:30,680 --> 01:50:33,720
When someone actually
walks towards me in slow motion...

1552
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:45,760
Have you fallen in love now?

1553
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:47,840
How will she reply?

1554
01:50:59,200 --> 01:51:00,720
Sound-proof studio, Nila.

1555
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,680
When did I say my name was Danny?

1556
01:51:07,600 --> 01:51:10,680
His name is Sebastian Gomes.

1557
01:51:13,560 --> 01:51:14,480
Danny...

1558
01:51:15,160 --> 01:51:16,880
was the name of our dog.

1559
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:20,520
Wherever he peed in the garden,
flowers grew.

1560
01:51:21,960 --> 01:51:23,760
So... Danny's flowers!

1561
01:51:25,120 --> 01:51:27,040
My mother's husband...

1562
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:29,720
unfortunately my father...

1563
01:51:30,320 --> 01:51:31,280
killed him.

1564
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:36,760
Why?

1565
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:37,800
Shut up!

1566
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:41,440
I'm talking, why are you interrupting?

1567
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:45,000
Why?

01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:48,240

01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:12,680
Why, Nila?

1596
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:14,440
Why?

1597
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:17,480
You were my cinema...

1598
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:19,280
beautiful,

1599
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:20,480
magical...

1600
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:22,840
Reality is...

1601
01:53:23,720 --> 01:53:25,200
ugly, flat, boring.

1602
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:29,040
Why did you have to become real
and ruin my film?

1603
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:34,680
'Pyaasa' (Thirsty)?

1604
01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:40,320
He is not answering his phone.

1605
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:43,000
But we found the name of his shop
- 'Danny's Flowers'.

1606
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:53,920
I loved you, Danny.

1607
01:53:55,840 --> 01:53:57,120
Sebastian Gomes.

1608
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:02,680
I am not a critic, Danny.

1609
01:54:02,920 --> 01:54:04,520
The police told me to...

1610
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:06,960
I know why you rated it one star.

1611
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:10,280
What would you rate it,
if it was up to you?

1612
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:13,560
Four stars.

1613
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:27,440
What a joke!

1614
01:54:28,440 --> 01:54:30,000
You would have given it four stars?

1615
01:54:30,440 --> 01:54:31,720
Four stars?

1616
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,200
It's a copy of a Mongolian film.

1617
01:54:34,720 --> 01:54:36,600
Every frame is a copy.

1618
01:54:36,880 --> 01:54:39,080
Not official. A stolen copy!

1619
01:54:44,840 --> 01:54:47,320
Mongolia makes some
very good films you know.

1620
01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:49,880
Haven't watched them?

1621
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:51,880
That's the problem...

1622
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:54,520
ignorant critics.

1623
01:54:55,600 --> 01:54:57,200
If you celebrate a thief,

1624
01:54:57,320 --> 01:54:59,240
everyone will think stealing is right!

1625
01:54:59,480 --> 01:55:01,680
Who will try to think out of the box?

1626
01:55:02,240 --> 01:55:03,680
Cinema is art,

1627
01:55:04,120 --> 01:55:06,200
not a damn photocopy machine!

1628
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:10,560
If you had given it one star
and said it was a copy,

1629
01:55:11,600 --> 01:55:14,320
I would have fallen at your feet.

1630
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:16,920
I would have been ecstatic...

1631
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:19,280
and my cinema would be alive.

1632
01:55:20,840 --> 01:55:22,560
I thought we had something
in common, Nila.

1633
01:55:24,120 --> 01:55:26,000
You turned out too real!

1634
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:32,720
Now I have to give you four little stars.

1635
01:56:21,240 --> 01:56:22,760
Bastard!

1636
01:57:02,360 --> 01:57:03,920
If the head splits
into a thousand pieces,

1637
01:57:04,040 --> 01:57:05,360
where will we carve the stars?

1638
01:57:05,640 --> 01:57:06,840
You should've thought of this!

1639
01:57:14,360 --> 01:57:17,560
A review is one person's opinion.
Everyone has a different opinion.

1640
01:57:18,920 --> 01:57:23,080
Tell me one film everyone
had the same opinion about.

1641
01:57:24,520 --> 01:57:25,440
'Chup (Shut Up)'

1642
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:27,360
written and directed
by Sebastian Gomes.

1643
01:57:28,720 --> 01:57:31,920
The one film everyone
had the same opinion about.

1644
01:57:33,240 --> 01:57:35,000
You didn't like your film too?

1645
01:57:43,880 --> 01:57:46,320
You also didn't like your film?

1646
01:57:47,600 --> 01:57:48,840
Then kill yourself first.

1647
01:57:51,480 --> 01:57:55,880
Criticism really hurts when the artist
is not sure of his own work.

1648
01:57:56,800 --> 01:57:59,440
Did you also give your film 'one star'?

1649
01:58:01,880 --> 01:58:02,880
Tell me.

1650
01:58:03,240 --> 01:58:04,280
Why are you silent?

1651
01:58:30,040 --> 01:58:32,200
? The world... ?

1652
01:59:22,200 --> 01:59:26,360
? This world of palaces,
of thrones, of crowns ?

1653
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:44,840
? This enemy of man,
this divided world ?

1654
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:52,360
? A world hungry for wealth
and full of traditions ?

1655
01:59:53,080 --> 01:59:58,480
? Would it matter if such a world
were mine? ?

1656
02:00:08,320 --> 02:00:13,640
? Wounded bodies, thirsty souls ?

1657
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:20,080
? Confused eyes, unhappy hearts ?

1658
02:00:23,720 --> 02:00:29,040
? Is this a world or a nightmare? ?

1659
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:35,560
? Would it matter if such a world
were mine? ?

1660
02:01:01,360 --> 02:01:02,400
Should we run away?

1661
02:01:02,520 --> 02:01:04,680
If we go, who'll look after Ma?

1662
02:01:06,640 --> 02:01:07,800
Look after Ma...

1663
02:01:08,320 --> 02:01:09,360
or cineMa?

1664
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:18,800
? Here a man's life is a toy ?

1665
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:24,080
? Here live worshippers of the dead ?

1666
02:01:26,640 --> 02:01:31,480
? Here death is cheaper than life ?

1667
02:01:32,840 --> 02:01:37,200
? Would it matter if such a world
were mine? ?

1668
02:01:51,160 --> 02:01:55,120
? Youth lose their way ?

1669
02:01:56,240 --> 02:01:58,080
As long as the real dog is alive,

1670
02:01:58,640 --> 02:01:59,480
chill.

1671
02:02:03,520 --> 02:02:07,440
? Here love is just another trade ?

1672
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:13,760
? Would it matter if such a world
were mine? ?

1673
02:02:54,320 --> 02:02:55,920
This is the story of his life.

1674
02:02:56,680 --> 02:02:58,080
He made his own biopic.

1675
02:02:58,400 --> 02:02:59,880
If this was his life,

1676
02:03:00,080 --> 02:03:01,720
I'm not surprised

1677
02:03:02,240 --> 02:03:04,040
that he turned out like this.

1678
02:03:06,640 --> 02:03:07,800
No.

1679
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:10,920
It was this life that made him
an artist.

1680
02:03:11,440 --> 02:03:14,360
Pain is the most powerful fuel
for an artist.

1681
02:03:16,760 --> 02:03:19,600
If his film had been appreciated
by the world,

1682
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:21,400
the story would have been different.

1683
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:24,760
But unfortunately, the critics...

1684
02:03:27,120 --> 02:03:30,280
they didn't just criticise his film,

1685
02:03:30,400 --> 02:03:32,840
they criticised his life.

1686
02:03:34,320 --> 02:03:35,960
They gave his pain a 'one star' rating...

1687
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,080
If someone ridicules your pain...

1688
02:03:42,560 --> 02:03:44,360
it can really damage you.

1689
02:03:44,840 --> 02:03:47,680
Critics finished what his father
just started.

1690
02:03:48,360 --> 02:03:49,680
He was in the wrong profession.

1691
02:03:49,800 --> 02:03:51,240
He should've been in politics.

1692
02:03:51,440 --> 02:03:52,600
There are so many critics here...

1693
02:03:53,960 --> 02:03:56,680
Danny's special scrambled eggs,
two portions.

1694
02:04:16,160 --> 02:04:17,920
Sukethu Varma,

1695
02:04:18,360 --> 02:04:19,760
film critic

1696
02:04:21,560 --> 02:04:23,720
dies of Covid.

1697
02:04:42,200 --> 02:04:43,280
Shut up!

1698
02:04:45,480 --> 02:04:47,760
He is mad, be sensitive.
