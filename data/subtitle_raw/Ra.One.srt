1
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,988
Barron Industries aim to rule...

2
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:42,459
...the digital world

3
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,826
Surpass 3D

4
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,655
Do you wonder...

5
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:49,098
...how data travels...

6
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:50,869
...from a phone?

7
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,462
How does it travel?

8
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:59,640
Surrounding us are millions...

9
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:02,748
...of rays

10
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,517
Everywhere, like the air

11
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,522
This virtual world...

12
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,956
...is ever-present

13
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:18,395
In shopping malls

14
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:23,599
In streets and homes,
in this very room

15
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,144
These rays allow digital data...

16
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:33,639
...to travel

17
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:40,184
Mr. Barron couldn't be here,
so he has...

18
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,921
...sent us an image

19
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:49,928
Without the use of any device,
can this image...

20
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:51,087
...come to life?

21
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,721
Can we see it?

22
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,833
A marvel of our technology

23
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:36,538
It isn't magic or
back projection, or 3D

24
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:43,048
The image is made of
countless invisible rays

25
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:45,479
Thanks to our technology...

26
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,779
...you'll see the image...

27
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,911
...and touch it

28
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:59,655
We're closing the gap between
the real and virtual worlds

29
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:41,641
It was a beautiful night

30
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:44,709
And so was she

31
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:47,212
"My Desi Girl."

32
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:52,648
Night waited for dawn
and she was waiting...

33
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,616
Go, Lucifer, go.

34
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:55,950
...for me...

35
00:05:56,724 --> 00:05:59,659
I. Lucifer.

36
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:06,989
To save a life, at times,
one must take a life

37
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:10,295
Ready to die first were...

38
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:12,161
...Bruce Lee's three friends...

39
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:18,976
Iski Lee. Uski Lee. Sabki Lee.

40
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:22,281
Then the face-off

41
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,951
With the challenger of challengers

42
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:28,680
The only man able to fight me

43
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,017
Not the good guy. The Villain

44
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:44,660
"Yes, I am a bad man."

45
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:55,778
"Somewhere up in the
skies is where he lives."

46
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:03,347
"The moon is where I quest to go."

47
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:06,187
"It's my request."

48
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:16,961
"Tonight. Tonight.
Something's going to happen."

49
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:48,390
What to do? Girls just fall for me

50
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:54,872
"What to do? Something happens."

51
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:02,942
My hero.

52
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:06,252
I hate uninvited guests

53
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:08,182
Bad times come uninvited

54
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:14,818
Do you know who I am?
I sprayed Spiderman with a poison

55
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:16,327
What worm are you?

56
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,694
Cool punch line!

57
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:20,698
You punch too?

58
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:21,893
Sure!

59
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,264
They clap at my wit

60
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:26,133
And wail when I hit

61
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:30,770
Lucifer. Careful!

62
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:33,011
Don't worry, desi girl

63
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,813
I'll fix him

64
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,108
Then how about dinner.
- Sure.

65
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:38,409
Where?

66
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:41,784
Anywhere. But not Chinese.
I just ate some

67
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:48,885
Is your flirting done?
Now can we fight?

68
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:17,922
Lucifer. He's got a big gun

69
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:40,039
"My name is..."

70
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:55,058
"The bad man."

71
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,457
"Wow.
What the kick?"

72
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:07,837
"My name is... My name is...
My name is Lucifer."

73
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,183
Desi Girl.

74
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:31,420
You've started that again?

75
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,293
Get up!

76
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:37,529
I said...

77
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:39,606
Get up.

78
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:45,844
Get up.

79
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,610
Get up.

80
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:49,438
Get up.

81
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:52,551
Get up.

82
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,511
Get up.

83
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:57,988
Get up.

84
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,449
Prateek Get up.

85
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:06,262
You were supposed to write
an essay on your father.

86
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:11,098
What does your father do?

87
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:12,905
My father.

88
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,997
I am sure he's your hero, isn't he?

89
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,574
Dad? My hero?

90
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:25,611
Can't chat now

91
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,255
Oh yes, love you very much sweety.

92
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:31,186
Can't chat now

93
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:33,918
Allow me to quote Navjot Singh Sidhu:

94
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:35,528
"Flirting turns the head."

95
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:38,256
"Eyes on the road instead."

96
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:39,922
Bye, sweety.

97
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,573
Allow me.

98
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:51,970
Have a good day.

99
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,447
Hey, Walter. Here.

100
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,253
What.
- Excuse me, madam.

101
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,582
Madam. Madam, I...

102
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,526
Hi...

103
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:16,567
Give me my keys

104
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,968
You speak Tamil?

105
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,438
No, no, no.

106
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:24,305
Not that kiss. Keys.

107
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:28,608
You are not understanding.
Okay. I just want the big one.

108
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:32,974
I don't want small,
small. I have duplicate.

109
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:36,546
Can you take it out please.
- Pervert.

110
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,428
What happened to you?

111
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:47,260
It's nothing

112
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:50,460
- What's up?
- The usual

113
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:56,036
Akashi. - Someone called him
Jackie Chan again

114
00:12:56,576 --> 00:13:01,479
I am not Jackie Chan.
Not every Chinese is Jackie Chan.

115
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:06,252
Mr. Jackie Chan. Sit down.

116
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:13,115
Seeing all of you gives me
no pleasure. I'm here...

117
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:15,990
...to tell you we have
a new video game contract

118
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,360
Hello.
- For sale in India, too

119
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:23,265
Your last games flopped

120
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,496
If this game flops...

121
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:26,435
...the department closes

122
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:29,235
I will have to shut it down.

123
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:34,472
I won't fire anyone.
I'll start a restaurant

124
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:36,206
Where you...

125
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,476
...and you will...

126
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:39,016
...be waiters

127
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:43,688
And... Mr. Shekar.

128
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:48,625
Hello, sir.
- And you shall be the main cook

129
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:51,794
Making idli, vada, dosa, sambar...

130
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:53,793
...and chutney

131
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:56,335
Any problem?

132
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:58,566
Does anyone else have a problem?

133
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:00,297
Shekhar?
- What? - Say something.

134
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,270
What?
- Come on.

135
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:07,445
Sir, excuse me, sir.
I have a problem, sir.

136
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:10,112
What's your problem?

137
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:16,652
I can't make idlis

138
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:20,625
Dosas?

139
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:25,596
Plain, masala, rava, onion,
veg, non-veg

140
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,132
No idlis

141
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,063
Good. - I hope you don't mind.
- Not at all.

142
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:30,500
Great.
- Thank you, sir.

143
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:44,548
Honey, I am home.

144
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:52,415
Sonia.

145
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,422
Sweety.

146
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,224
You papa pancake

147
00:14:58,431 --> 00:14:59,659
Yummy, thank you.

148
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:01,495
Brother buttercup

149
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:03,828
You work too hard

150
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,330
Just "kondom"

151
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:09,568
Your Tamil is naughty

152
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:10,869
You mean "a tiny bit"

153
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:12,838
You never take me seriously

154
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,514
Wait till my book becomes
a bestseller

155
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:20,882
My thesis on cuss words...

156
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:26,325
...is important for India.
A must for every Indian woman

157
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:30,522
You're Sonia Subramaniam.
Not Sonia Gandhi

158
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,823
Why do cuss words pick
on mothers? And sisters?

159
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:37,165
Why not fathers? Brothers?

160
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,498
I am not responsible for it.

161
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:43,440
When my thesis is done,
women all over India...

162
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:46,205
...will puff up their chests...

163
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:47,541
Too bold

164
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:52,209
OK. They'll proudly
say: "You papa pancake"

165
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:54,450
Big buttercup

166
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:56,852
You uncle undie

167
00:15:56,957 --> 00:16:00,757
- Why is the song so loud?
- I'm talking, not singing

168
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:03,260
No, no, not you, darling.
One second.

169
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:05,263
Prateek.
- Why you...

170
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:08,200
Prateek Prateek

171
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:10,935
What, father?
- Lower that volume

172
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:13,205
What?
- Lower that volume

173
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,433
Of course.
- So...

174
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:17,699
You are banging the...

175
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:19,411
Put it down!

176
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,679
I am watching you, little rascal.

177
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:28,276
I am watching you.
- What is it, Shekhar?

178
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:30,321
He slams the door on me.
Come here! Its dinner time.

179
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:32,254
You drive me mad. Just wait
- Come on.

180
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:34,418
Let's go eat
- Little rascal.

181
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:45,771
Tell us about your new video game

182
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:48,407
Of course, of course.
After all it is for kids.

183
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:52,543
Dude.
- No, dad. Its dude.

184
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:55,610
Like, dude with attitude.

185
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:57,711
Dude.
- Okay.

186
00:16:57,984 --> 00:16:59,952
A brand new game

187
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,684
A new hero...

188
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:04,346
Heroes bore

189
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,622
I hate heroes. Heroes are boring.

190
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:08,921
Old or new

191
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:11,924
Don't you like heroes?
Do you prefer villains?

192
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:15,559
Yes. Villains are awesome.
They have no rules

193
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:19,764
They just win. Anyone
comes in their way... bam!

194
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:22,334
You be careful.
- Take my advice.

195
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:27,541
Make a game with
a villain who never loses

196
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,739
You are speaking absolute nonsense.

197
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:32,543
The hero always win

198
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:35,453
Truth and goodness win

199
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:38,288
Yes right, dad. Just like you.

200
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:41,022
My father, my hero.
- Prateek.

201
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:44,762
Don't be a smartypant.

202
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:46,731
Allow me to quote...

203
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,528
...Late Mr. V. Shantaram.

204
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:50,926
"Tread the right path"

205
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:55,330
"Combat evil, so with a smile...

206
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:57,340
...you die"

207
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,375
Good night, dad. - What goodnight?
The discussion is not over.

208
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:06,678
One slap. One, one...
- Shekar.

209
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:09,550
I will give him one.
- Shekar.

210
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:14,819
V. Shantaram?
- Yes, really. Really.

211
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:16,759
V. Shantaram.
- Right.

212
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:21,023
Goodnight, honey.
- Okay.

213
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:23,402
I will have all
the noodles and curd by myself.

214
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:24,831
The villain never loses

215
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:28,937
How is it possible? Never loses

216
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:38,750
"Beloved. Beloved."

217
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:45,081
"Beloved. Beloved."

218
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:50,020
I'll show you bad

219
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,091
Mom, what are you doing?

220
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:55,060
Hurry up. Time for school

221
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:57,932
Dad will take you today.
- Dad.

222
00:18:58,037 --> 00:19:00,471
We'll be late if Dad drives

223
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:02,541
Driving Miss Daisy!

224
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:03,870
Not anymore.

225
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,808
"I'm bad."

226
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:22,927
"Dance with me."

227
00:19:31,905 --> 00:19:33,600
That is your dad, right?

228
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:35,438
No.

229
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:47,720
Okay. Bye, children.

230
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,483
Bye, dad.
- Bye little April. - Bye.

231
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,620
Prateek, come here

232
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:56,520
Come, come, come.

233
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:58,760
Dad. You know I don't do that.

234
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:00,593
Yeah. Okay.

235
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:02,958
I want to tell you something

236
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:04,761
You like villains?

237
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:08,168
I'll make you a villain...

238
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:09,771
...mightier than the hero

239
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:12,469
He'll never lose

240
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:14,979
You like that, don't you?
Give me your hand.

241
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,517
But never forget, Prateek

242
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:22,511
Evil is wicked and bad

243
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,416
Allow me to quote myself:

244
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:28,152
"Sell your soul to the Devil and
evil's shadow won't leave you"

245
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:32,022
"Sell your soul to the Devil and
evil's shadow won't leave you"

246
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:34,622
Shadow.
- Means "shadow"

247
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:36,959
Whatever?
- Whatever is good.

248
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,598
World's bad villain.

249
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:48,939
Today's lesson is on LAN.

250
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:50,709
Local Area Network.

251
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,841
Who's Lucifer?

252
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:56,586
When I play video games...

253
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:58,179
...my gaming name is Lucifer

254
00:20:58,524 --> 00:21:00,617
WLAN. Wireless LAN.

255
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:04,094
Allows interconnectivity
between computers.

256
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:13,005
Ms. Boyle can log on
to our computers

257
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:16,734
Now I will seek connection
to all of your computers.

258
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:18,843
So then monitor
appears on this projection.

259
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:26,009
She'll ask for permission.
We say no

260
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:29,486
Fatso says yes

261
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,124
I've hacked and he is jacked.

262
00:21:33,226 --> 00:21:35,922
And I am sending the invitation now.

263
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:43,224
Let's see who will be
the first person to accept my request.

264
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:49,998
Billy. Thank you, Billy,
for accepting my invitation.

265
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:52,634
Let's see what Billy has to share.

266
00:22:04,891 --> 00:22:06,859
Billy, out.

267
00:22:08,728 --> 00:22:12,755
I have a great idea
for our new video game

268
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:14,560
We'll create...

269
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:15,827
...the mightiest...

270
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:17,129
Hero.

271
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:19,032
Villain.
- Villain?

272
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:21,163
Yes, villain. But, why?

273
00:22:21,274 --> 00:22:23,765
Because, Jenny.
Villains are awesome.

274
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,571
What do you say, Akashi.

275
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:29,940
For Prateek, right?

276
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:35,120
Yes

277
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:36,186
Of course.

278
00:22:36,422 --> 00:22:42,827
"Joy will last longer than grief.
Don't lose hope."

279
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:47,097
"If we are together..."

280
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:51,169
"...why to feel afraid
during the journey?"

281
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:58,074
"With wings beneath our feet."

282
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:03,274
"You and I will fly away."

283
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:06,778
"Walk along with joy."

284
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,017
"If the path is open,
regardless of where we meet...

285
00:23:09,122 --> 00:23:12,148
...the destination
will begin from there."

286
00:23:15,661 --> 00:23:17,822
"Walk along with joy."

287
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,898
"If the path is open,
regardless of where we meet...

288
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:22,832
...the destination
will begin from there."

289
00:23:25,304 --> 00:23:26,794
"Don't worry about a thing now.

290
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:30,865
Because I will be right by your side.
I will be right by your side."

291
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:32,911
"Don't worry about a thing now.

292
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:36,139
Because I will be holding you tight.
I will be holding you tight."

293
00:23:36,783 --> 00:23:38,876
"Don't worry about a thing now.

294
00:23:38,985 --> 00:23:41,852
Because I will be right by your side.
I will be right by your side."

295
00:23:41,988 --> 00:23:46,220
"Don't worry about a thing now.
Because I will be holding you tight."

296
00:23:46,325 --> 00:23:50,261
Okay, boys and girls.
A name for our villain?

297
00:23:50,363 --> 00:23:54,800
We can't keep calling him
"Random Access Version One?"

298
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:57,062
We have to think of some good name.
- Dracula.

299
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:59,104
No, no. You.
- Raaka.

300
00:23:59,238 --> 00:24:02,867
Guys, guys.
It's staring you in the face

301
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:06,411
Meaning?
- Random Access Version One.

302
00:24:06,712 --> 00:24:08,009
"Ra. One"

303
00:24:08,147 --> 00:24:10,809
- What's that?
- Raavan!

304
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:15,246
The demon Raavan?

305
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:17,288
A modern day Raavan

306
00:24:17,423 --> 00:24:20,984
Wild idea!

307
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:23,994
I like Ra. One it is very dangerous.

308
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,860
What about the hero's name?

309
00:24:27,033 --> 00:24:30,400
Hero's name.

310
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:34,900
"G. One?"

311
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:38,704
Good one. G. One means "life"

312
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:44,105
Ra. One = danger. G. One = life

313
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:54,219
Hi.

314
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:57,262
Come on. Come on. Okay.

315
00:25:08,274 --> 00:25:13,940
"If your dreams are
hiding somewhere."

316
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:18,949
"If you are
hesitating to take a step."

317
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:24,284
"I will make your dreams
come true in an instant."

318
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:29,794
"I will again adorn it in
the sky, beyond the stars."

319
00:25:29,896 --> 00:25:35,732
"The sorrows that are in my life,
I will convert it into joy for you."

320
00:25:37,103 --> 00:25:39,162
"Walk along with joy."

321
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:43,136
"If the path is open,
regardless of where we meet...

322
00:25:43,242 --> 00:25:44,971
...the destination
will begin from there."

323
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:49,874
"Walk along with joy."

324
00:25:50,483 --> 00:25:52,007
Just like Jackie Chan.

325
00:25:55,288 --> 00:25:57,222
It's working.

326
00:25:57,491 --> 00:26:01,018
"Don't worry about a thing now.
Because I will be right by your side.

327
00:26:01,161 --> 00:26:02,150
I will be right by your side."

328
00:26:02,796 --> 00:26:06,459
A birthday gift

329
00:26:08,368 --> 00:26:12,395
"Don't worry about a thing now.
Because I will be right by your side.

330
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:13,801
I will be right by your side."

331
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:17,908
- What's up?
- The hero must have a face

332
00:26:18,011 --> 00:26:21,310
"I will be holding you tight.
Don't worry about a thing now.

333
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:23,406
Because I will be right by your side.
I will be right by your side."

334
00:26:23,517 --> 00:26:30,081
"Don't worry about a thing now.
Because I will be holding you tight."

335
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:39,123
He's spectacular

336
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:41,894
Terrific smile

337
00:26:42,402 --> 00:26:47,066
I didn't program a smile

338
00:26:47,374 --> 00:26:48,807
Didn't you?

339
00:26:50,344 --> 00:26:53,142
Why is he smiling?

340
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,974
Is he learning things by himself?

341
00:27:05,158 --> 00:27:11,324
Okay. Now everyone look closely.

342
00:27:11,598 --> 00:27:14,931
The game's main part

343
00:27:15,502 --> 00:27:17,970
The HART

344
00:27:18,071 --> 00:27:19,834
As in "heart?"

345
00:27:19,973 --> 00:27:23,204
Not heart. Always talking romantic.

346
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:28,247
Not that heart, the HART is Hertz
Amplifying Resonance Transmitter.

347
00:27:28,448 --> 00:27:33,977
It gives the players their power

348
00:27:38,025 --> 00:27:40,892
As the players go
from level to level...

349
00:27:40,994 --> 00:27:44,430
...the HART's power increases,
the colour intensifies

350
00:27:44,531 --> 00:27:48,490
And now... let me come to
the most interesting part.

351
00:27:48,902 --> 00:27:53,532
If the HART is not
connected to G. One and Ra. One...

352
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:58,409
...you cannot destroy them

353
00:28:01,281 --> 00:28:04,580
If you destroy the HART,
they won't die

354
00:28:04,918 --> 00:28:06,249
No, no, sir.

355
00:28:15,662 --> 00:28:19,530
Destroy their bodies,
they won't die either

356
00:28:19,633 --> 00:28:25,071
Connect them to their
HARTs then destroy them

357
00:28:26,173 --> 00:28:28,038
When does that happen?

358
00:28:28,141 --> 00:28:30,507
Only on level three.

359
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:36,173
The players get an anti-HART gun
with one bullet

360
00:28:36,316 --> 00:28:40,685
The first to hit the target wins

361
00:28:42,589 --> 00:28:48,152
The player who misses...

362
00:28:48,995 --> 00:28:53,398
So the HART is their strength?
And weakness?

363
00:28:53,533 --> 00:28:56,229
Let me also be... Allow me
to be as romantic as Jenny.

364
00:28:56,336 --> 00:28:59,601
"A hero isn't made of
muscle or metal

365
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,142
"A superhero is made or
undone by his heart alone" Wow.

366
00:29:04,277 --> 00:29:07,075
Great.

367
00:29:29,569 --> 00:29:34,165
See? The movie villain lost,
the hero won. Very good. I like.

368
00:29:34,307 --> 00:29:37,640
That's why the film bombed.
The villain was cool

369
00:29:37,744 --> 00:29:40,304
Not cool. A bloody fool,
a chain-smoker

370
00:29:40,413 --> 00:29:42,574
Smoking kills

371
00:29:43,016 --> 00:29:45,177
This kid is smoking

372
00:29:45,318 --> 00:29:46,683
- Let's go - I must talk to him

373
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,386
Hey little boy. Little boy.
- Let's go.

374
00:29:49,489 --> 00:29:51,389
Your Mom knows you smoke?

375
00:29:52,092 --> 00:29:53,719
Sure!
- I see.

376
00:29:54,394 --> 00:29:56,555
But she doesn't know I kill

377
00:29:56,696 --> 00:29:58,186
With a fork?

378
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,692
- A nail cutter
- A knife

379
00:30:01,802 --> 00:30:04,396
He's flashing a knife.
And he isn't a small child either.

380
00:30:04,504 --> 00:30:08,099
Dad, don't worry.
We can smash his teeth in

381
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:10,142
Your wallet!

382
00:30:10,277 --> 00:30:13,178
Of course, sir. Of course.
Give him a slap

383
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:18,410
Sorry, sir. Here's the money,
sir. Plus a tip

384
00:30:18,518 --> 00:30:20,509
A slap, please!
- Slap.

385
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,487
What else do you have?
- That's all I have, sir

386
00:30:23,623 --> 00:30:26,615
I gave you everything I had, sir.
- Don't move

387
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:31,356
Yes, sir. - You haven't
seen me. Now count to 2000

388
00:30:31,464 --> 00:30:33,728
Good number sir.
That's my lucky number.

389
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:36,234
Don't slip on the wet road, sir.

390
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:38,328
Goodnight, sir.

391
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:43,802
See? I scared him off

392
00:30:44,811 --> 00:30:48,611
But he might return.
Start counting. Good practice

393
00:30:48,715 --> 00:30:52,481
Yeah right, dad.

394
00:30:52,586 --> 00:30:54,178
1000... Prateek.

395
00:30:54,287 --> 00:30:56,084
Prateek, wait

396
00:30:56,189 --> 00:31:00,489
You didn't even fight back.
You coward

397
00:31:00,594 --> 00:31:04,462
No, Prateek. I'm not a coward

398
00:31:04,631 --> 00:31:07,259
I didn't hit him
because he could've hurt you

399
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:10,598
Allow me to quote the great
Mahatma Gandhi...

400
00:31:10,704 --> 00:31:12,672
..."An eye for an eye makes
the whole world blind"

401
00:31:13,139 --> 00:31:16,540
I'm no coward, Prateek

402
00:31:19,212 --> 00:31:21,476
I am... Hey...

403
00:31:26,586 --> 00:31:30,181
Okay, Akashi. One last time.
I mean one last time.

404
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:32,315
Let's try.
- One last time.

405
00:31:41,768 --> 00:31:43,235
Alright, guys.

406
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:46,396
South-India Coffee break.
That means we meet tomorrow. Bye.

407
00:32:03,456 --> 00:32:06,254
Check the system. Somebody
go and check the main system.

408
00:32:07,727 --> 00:32:08,819
Okay, okay, I am going to check it.
- Why is it constantly back...

409
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:10,191
...sizing inside it?

410
00:32:12,265 --> 00:32:14,733
What happened there?
- Come on, guys.

411
00:32:16,403 --> 00:32:19,566
The launch is in two days.
We can't have a problem

412
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,319
Ladies and Gentlemen.

413
00:32:39,426 --> 00:32:43,385
Barron Industries present...

414
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:47,330
...a unique and spectacular game

415
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:56,400
Thank you my darlings.
Thank you all very much.

416
00:32:56,943 --> 00:32:58,774
Akashi's mom

417
00:32:58,878 --> 00:33:00,846
Hello.
- My better.

418
00:33:00,981 --> 00:33:02,642
Now hold your breath!

419
00:33:02,749 --> 00:33:06,310
Barron Industries presents
for the first time ever.

420
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:08,580
Ra. One.

421
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:19,498
Relax. Shekhar.

422
00:33:19,733 --> 00:33:22,827
Year 2050

423
00:33:23,903 --> 00:33:26,303
The world lies in ruin

424
00:33:27,607 --> 00:33:30,906
A villain never seen before...

425
00:33:31,411 --> 00:33:34,608
...spreads terror in his wake

426
00:33:35,648 --> 00:33:38,640
An evil villain reigns

427
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:44,388
Created out of
history's ten most evil men...

428
00:33:44,624 --> 00:33:46,524
...he is undefeatable

429
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,828
An invincible villain

430
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:53,728
With the power to
invade and control our minds

431
00:33:54,367 --> 00:33:59,669
He is equal to ten
villains rolled in one. Ra. One.

432
00:34:01,741 --> 00:34:07,805
Waging war! My only duty

433
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:11,914
Wow.

434
00:34:12,052 --> 00:34:15,988
Prateek. Ra. One.
The ultimate villain.

435
00:34:16,289 --> 00:34:20,919
He can change form.
Turn into a man or woman

436
00:34:21,061 --> 00:34:24,724
Wired with artificial intelligence

437
00:34:24,831 --> 00:34:28,028
Ra. One adapts, transforms

438
00:34:28,368 --> 00:34:30,029
New forms, new moves

439
00:34:30,336 --> 00:34:32,896
Never the same threat

440
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:38,468
Good morning.

441
00:34:38,578 --> 00:34:43,447
To fight Ra. One,
the player has a Superhero

442
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,811
All players get a control suit

443
00:34:45,952 --> 00:34:48,512
Wear it and get connected

444
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:53,355
Wear it and get
connected to your Superhero

445
00:34:53,493 --> 00:34:54,858
I am on.

446
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:01,566
Hey Jackie Chan.

447
00:35:01,668 --> 00:35:03,795
He is not Jackie Chan.

448
00:35:04,037 --> 00:35:07,564
Every player can be G. One

449
00:35:07,707 --> 00:35:10,676
A superhero, with a heart.
- Father.

450
00:35:11,945 --> 00:35:14,539
Superhero.

451
00:35:14,647 --> 00:35:17,673
Okay.
- He is looking hot, isn't he?

452
00:35:18,551 --> 00:35:19,643
So hot.

453
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:22,721
Let's play.

454
00:36:31,024 --> 00:36:34,016
I want to play

455
00:36:34,127 --> 00:36:36,561
No party for me

456
00:36:36,696 --> 00:36:39,392
Akashi. I want to play
the game now. Please.

457
00:36:39,532 --> 00:36:42,660
Shekhar, its okay.
Come on, come on. Come with me.

458
00:36:42,802 --> 00:36:44,497
Prateek liked the game

459
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:47,836
Thank you, Jenny.

460
00:36:53,179 --> 00:36:56,615
Same name. Lucifer.
- Yes.

461
00:36:56,783 --> 00:36:58,011
Lucifer.

462
00:37:00,653 --> 00:37:02,416
Okay. Ground rule. Game begins.

463
00:37:02,522 --> 00:37:05,650
Level one. Power blast.

464
00:37:05,758 --> 00:37:08,625
Come, Ra. One! Kick-ass time

465
00:37:09,462 --> 00:37:11,054
Welcome, Lucifer

466
00:37:12,031 --> 00:37:15,125
Welcome to the dark world of death

467
00:37:15,235 --> 00:37:18,068
Zip it. Crap face.

468
00:37:18,238 --> 00:37:19,899
I am a gaming champion.

469
00:37:22,075 --> 00:37:23,201
Good move.

470
00:37:41,594 --> 00:37:42,788
Down.

471
00:37:59,245 --> 00:38:01,509
Level two, killer combat.

472
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:08,714
Yeah!

473
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:25,696
What?

474
00:38:28,908 --> 00:38:30,068
Cheers

475
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:42,884
"Look out, look out.
The siren's blaring."

476
00:38:42,989 --> 00:38:46,584
"You drop it down.
I can't stop staring."

477
00:38:51,297 --> 00:38:53,822
"Your smile is so criminal."

478
00:38:54,067 --> 00:38:57,559
"Your eyes are deceiving."

479
00:38:57,704 --> 00:39:00,969
"Yet I fell for you."

480
00:39:06,346 --> 00:39:08,746
"Just like a criminal."

481
00:39:08,848 --> 00:39:10,873
"She's burning like a fever."

482
00:39:10,983 --> 00:39:12,678
"And I am a believer."

483
00:39:12,819 --> 00:39:14,946
"She's enchanting."

484
00:39:16,055 --> 00:39:19,957
"Not just these eyes."

485
00:39:20,093 --> 00:39:22,584
"But your attitude's
full of mischief."

486
00:39:22,729 --> 00:39:26,927
"It's criminal, way that
booty going bop, bop, bop."

487
00:39:28,067 --> 00:39:32,299
"It's criminal, way that party
won't stop, stop, stop."

488
00:39:33,773 --> 00:39:37,209
"Each day your Love...
Torments the heart"

489
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:40,711
"Your sight steals my heart."

490
00:39:40,813 --> 00:39:42,747
"Each day your Love..."

491
00:39:42,849 --> 00:39:44,874
"Torments the heart"

492
00:39:44,984 --> 00:39:48,078
"Your sight steals my heart."

493
00:39:48,187 --> 00:39:52,283
"It's criminal, way that
booty going bop, bop, bop."

494
00:40:03,236 --> 00:40:05,033
"Every eye."

495
00:40:05,138 --> 00:40:07,606
"Stares at me."

496
00:40:07,707 --> 00:40:09,334
"They stop and stare."

497
00:40:10,676 --> 00:40:12,075
"My charisma's radiant."

498
00:40:12,211 --> 00:40:14,805
"My attitude's graceful."

499
00:40:14,947 --> 00:40:17,040
"It's graceful."

500
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:21,286
"Your attitude steal my slumber."

501
00:40:21,387 --> 00:40:25,050
"And your hair does the rest."

502
00:40:25,191 --> 00:40:28,354
"So you tell us how
do we save ourselves."

503
00:40:28,661 --> 00:40:31,926
"Because your eyes steal my heart."

504
00:40:32,131 --> 00:40:36,033
"It's criminal, way that
booty going bop, bop, bop."

505
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:41,664
"It's criminal, way that
party won't stop, stop, stop."

506
00:40:42,775 --> 00:40:46,677
"Each day your Love...
Torments the heart"

507
00:40:46,779 --> 00:40:49,873
"Your sight steals my heart."

508
00:40:49,982 --> 00:40:52,075
"Each day your Love..."

509
00:40:52,185 --> 00:40:55,780
"Torments the heart"

510
00:40:55,922 --> 00:40:57,890
"Your sight steals my heart."

511
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:01,685
"Slyly you stole..."

512
00:41:01,828 --> 00:41:05,264
"My breath."

513
00:41:05,364 --> 00:41:12,395
"Slyly. - She came in my dreams.
She got me losing my mind."

514
00:41:12,705 --> 00:41:16,106
"Slyly.
- Dwelled in my eyes."

515
00:41:16,209 --> 00:41:19,303
"Slyly.
- Came in my dreams."

516
00:41:19,445 --> 00:41:22,778
"Slyly.
- Gave me sleepless nights."

517
00:41:22,882 --> 00:41:27,376
"She got me losing my mind."

518
00:41:28,855 --> 00:41:32,086
"Your eyes are deceiving."

519
00:41:32,191 --> 00:41:36,093
"Yet I fell for you."

520
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,432
"Just like a criminal."
- "She's burning like a fever."

521
00:41:45,738 --> 00:41:49,834
"And I am a
believer." "She's enchanting."

522
00:41:50,877 --> 00:41:52,845
"Not just these eyes."

523
00:41:52,945 --> 00:41:54,742
"But your attitude's...

524
00:41:54,847 --> 00:41:57,145
...full of mischief."

525
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:01,744
"It's criminal, way that
booty going bop, bop, bop."

526
00:42:02,989 --> 00:42:07,119
"It's criminal, way that
party won't stop, stop, stop."

527
00:42:08,194 --> 00:42:11,891
"Each day your Love...
Torments the heart"

528
00:42:11,998 --> 00:42:15,729
"Your sight steals my heart."

529
00:42:15,835 --> 00:42:19,464
"Each day your Love..."

530
00:42:19,772 --> 00:42:22,741
"Torments the heart"

531
00:42:22,842 --> 00:42:26,505
"Your sight steals my heart."

532
00:42:26,812 --> 00:42:30,043
"Each day your Love...
Torments the heart"

533
00:42:30,149 --> 00:42:33,915
"Your sight steals my heart."

534
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:37,217
"Each day your Love..."

535
00:42:37,323 --> 00:42:41,157
"Torments the heart"

536
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:44,923
"Your sight steals my heart."

537
00:42:45,031 --> 00:42:46,965
"Criminal."

538
00:42:54,206 --> 00:42:55,468
Hey, Lucifer. Let's go.

539
00:42:55,942 --> 00:42:57,807
This stuff rocks. Where is dad?

540
00:42:59,812 --> 00:43:03,873
The game isn't over

541
00:43:04,417 --> 00:43:05,907
He's down, waiting for you.
Come on.

542
00:43:06,218 --> 00:43:07,913
I'm nearly at Level 3

543
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,915
I can whoop his ass.

544
00:43:11,357 --> 00:43:14,155
No one defeats Ra. One and survives

545
00:43:14,894 --> 00:43:17,021
No one in office has
crossed level one yet.

546
00:43:17,129 --> 00:43:18,562
Come back, Lucifer.

547
00:43:18,998 --> 00:43:21,933
Or I'll hunt you in the real world

548
00:43:22,034 --> 00:43:24,332
Go ahead. I'll fix you

549
00:43:30,509 --> 00:43:33,069
Ra. One never loses

550
00:43:41,253 --> 00:43:46,350
When the game ends,
so does your life

551
00:43:46,592 --> 00:43:48,457
You will die.

552
00:43:49,061 --> 00:43:50,858
Lucifer will die.

553
00:43:54,133 --> 00:43:56,101
You will die.

554
00:44:27,166 --> 00:44:31,967
A problem with the game, I must go

555
00:44:32,905 --> 00:44:34,031
It's okay.
- Let's go.

556
00:44:34,173 --> 00:44:35,265
Bye.

557
00:44:36,108 --> 00:44:37,166
Come on.

558
00:44:37,276 --> 00:44:38,436
Dad

559
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:42,938
For you and Ra. One.

560
00:44:51,123 --> 00:44:52,351
I will see you, bye.

561
00:44:52,491 --> 00:44:53,651
"You mean everything to me."

562
00:44:56,462 --> 00:44:58,453
Why doesn't Ra. One power down?

563
00:44:58,664 --> 00:45:00,131
Let us have a drink. Celebrate.

564
00:45:00,232 --> 00:45:01,290
I don't want to drink.

565
00:45:01,434 --> 00:45:04,232
Not you. Ra. One and me

566
00:45:04,336 --> 00:45:06,099
Come, come, come.
- You are not taking me seriously.

567
00:45:06,205 --> 00:45:07,502
I will go check the mainframe room.

568
00:45:07,606 --> 00:45:09,904
You go and check
the programming room.

569
00:45:10,009 --> 00:45:11,101
Now.

570
00:45:16,215 --> 00:45:19,981
Ra. One sir, you were terrific today.

571
00:45:20,086 --> 00:45:21,917
Really I tell you. Really, I...

572
00:45:35,101 --> 00:45:37,194
From me to you.

573
00:45:39,438 --> 00:45:44,239
Happy birthday to you.

574
00:45:47,113 --> 00:45:50,082
Today you are born.

575
00:45:51,984 --> 00:45:53,508
I will go and check
the programming room.

576
00:45:53,619 --> 00:45:57,487
But... I will be back.

577
00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:01,587
I will see you.

578
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,403
See you later, alligator.

579
00:46:25,718 --> 00:46:28,050
So?
- So.

580
00:46:28,154 --> 00:46:29,678
Liked the game?

581
00:46:30,022 --> 00:46:31,080
Yeah!

582
00:46:31,257 --> 00:46:33,657
Didn't you want to just hug Dad?

583
00:46:34,193 --> 00:46:35,285
Mom, please.

584
00:46:35,394 --> 00:46:38,124
Cool game. I'll tell him

585
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:39,322
So why didn't you?

586
00:46:39,431 --> 00:46:42,423
We live in the same house.
I can tell him tomorrow

587
00:46:43,335 --> 00:46:44,427
All right

588
00:46:44,703 --> 00:46:46,227
You felt like hugging him, right?

589
00:46:46,705 --> 00:46:48,332
What did you want to do with him?

590
00:46:49,275 --> 00:46:51,607
Mom, stop. - You wanted to hug him.
- Mom, stop.

591
00:46:52,478 --> 00:46:54,605
Okay, Mr. Ra. One.

592
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:59,080
Akashi says we can't turn you off

593
00:46:59,585 --> 00:47:00,779
Let us see.

594
00:47:02,188 --> 00:47:03,746
Segmentation full.

595
00:47:06,392 --> 00:47:08,292
Ra. One not stopping?

596
00:47:19,238 --> 00:47:22,036
Hello, Akashi.
- Do you see anything unusual.

597
00:47:22,141 --> 00:47:24,302
Ra. One's not stopping.

598
00:47:25,845 --> 00:47:27,403
I told you so.

599
00:47:27,746 --> 00:47:29,236
Is the main-frame alright?

600
00:47:30,082 --> 00:47:31,447
I am looking.

601
00:47:31,584 --> 00:47:32,642
The log is not
showing anything unusual.

602
00:47:35,221 --> 00:47:38,349
I will bring the GPU and
we will work on this together. Okay?

603
00:47:41,393 --> 00:47:42,485
Okay. I am...

604
00:47:52,205 --> 00:47:54,332
Fatal system error.

605
00:47:55,542 --> 00:47:57,601
Fatal system error.

606
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:01,069
Fatal system error.

607
00:48:02,315 --> 00:48:03,714
Fatal system error.

608
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:38,371
Where's Ra. One?

609
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:18,778
A rose?

610
00:51:03,897 --> 00:51:04,989
Who is there?

611
00:51:20,413 --> 00:51:22,540
Lucifer has to die.

612
00:51:23,083 --> 00:51:25,916
Lucifer must die.

613
00:51:58,985 --> 00:52:00,850
Are you Lucifer?

614
00:52:10,563 --> 00:52:11,723
Lucifer?

615
00:52:12,899 --> 00:52:14,799
I am not Lucifer.

616
00:52:14,934 --> 00:52:16,993
Then you are not use to me.

617
00:52:22,142 --> 00:52:23,575
Akashi, pick up!

618
00:52:38,158 --> 00:52:39,455
Akashi.

619
00:52:46,499 --> 00:52:47,625
Akashi.

620
00:52:53,072 --> 00:52:54,505
Akashi.

621
00:53:35,515 --> 00:53:38,643
Sonia. Prateek. Pick up the phone!

622
00:54:17,523 --> 00:54:18,615
Ra. One.

623
00:54:22,929 --> 00:54:26,558
He's broken out of the game?

624
00:54:27,233 --> 00:54:29,463
I want Lucifer

625
00:54:30,803 --> 00:54:31,929
Lucifer.

626
00:54:34,507 --> 00:54:36,805
I will finish him.

627
00:54:40,179 --> 00:54:41,908
Are you Lucifer?

628
00:54:46,219 --> 00:54:48,585
Are you Lucifer?

629
00:54:50,523 --> 00:54:54,220
I am Lucifer

630
00:55:01,567 --> 00:55:04,161
I am Lucifer

631
00:55:04,937 --> 00:55:06,632
You're lying

632
00:55:55,588 --> 00:55:56,782
Yes, speaking.

633
00:56:59,419 --> 00:57:02,877
"Why won't you talk to me?"

634
00:57:02,989 --> 00:57:08,086
"Why turn your back on me?"

635
00:57:08,294 --> 00:57:14,699
"How do I turn the clock back?"

636
00:57:15,835 --> 00:57:18,998
"Why won't you talk to me?"

637
00:57:19,105 --> 00:57:24,372
"Why turn your back on me?"

638
00:57:24,677 --> 00:57:30,980
"How do I turn the clock back?"

639
00:57:31,984 --> 00:57:34,782
"Without you, nights never end."

640
00:57:35,221 --> 00:57:38,418
"Without you, I know no peace."

641
00:57:38,724 --> 00:57:44,822
"Without you, how can I live?"

642
00:57:45,398 --> 00:57:48,196
"My eyes fill with tears."

643
00:57:48,301 --> 00:57:51,134
"My eyes fill with tears."

644
00:57:51,804 --> 00:57:54,830
"My eyes fill with tears."

645
00:57:54,941 --> 00:57:57,671
"My eyes fill with tears."

646
00:57:58,244 --> 00:58:01,111
"My eyes fill with tears."

647
00:58:01,247 --> 00:58:04,239
"My eyes fill with tears."

648
00:58:04,917 --> 00:58:07,750
"My eyes fill with tears."

649
00:58:07,854 --> 00:58:10,721
"My eyes fill with tears."

650
00:58:11,324 --> 00:58:12,689
"There's a hole in the soul...

651
00:58:12,792 --> 00:58:16,228
...because you take
a little piece of me with you."

652
00:58:17,964 --> 00:58:19,226
"There's a hole in the soul...

653
00:58:19,332 --> 00:58:23,029
...because you take
a little piece of me with you."

654
00:58:24,303 --> 00:58:25,770
"There's a hole in the soul...

655
00:58:25,905 --> 00:58:29,204
...because you take
a little piece of me with you."

656
00:58:33,079 --> 00:58:34,103
Dad...

657
00:58:35,081 --> 00:58:36,343
What is it?

658
00:58:36,916 --> 00:58:38,884
Dad didn't die in an accident

659
00:58:41,287 --> 00:58:42,879
Ra. One killed him

660
00:58:44,056 --> 00:58:45,114
Ra. One.

661
00:58:45,224 --> 00:58:47,988
The game villain

662
00:58:49,061 --> 00:58:50,756
What are you saying?

663
00:59:11,485 --> 00:59:12,816
Do meet me...

664
00:59:13,487 --> 00:59:14,818
Hello.

665
00:59:18,392 --> 00:59:19,484
What?

666
00:59:24,264 --> 00:59:26,129
I'm not going to India

667
00:59:26,233 --> 00:59:27,393
Prateek, listen to me.

668
00:59:27,534 --> 00:59:29,502
I must know how Dad died

669
00:59:29,903 --> 00:59:31,996
It was an accident

670
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:34,799
We're leaving today

671
00:59:35,042 --> 00:59:37,010
Not me

672
00:59:37,844 --> 00:59:38,970
And that's final.
- Prateek.

673
00:59:41,448 --> 00:59:47,853
You promised me you would return

674
00:59:48,121 --> 00:59:53,923
Why tie me to you,
if you won't come back?

675
00:59:54,494 --> 00:59:57,395
I wait with racing heart

676
00:59:57,864 --> 01:00:00,924
I listen for your step

677
01:00:01,134 --> 01:00:04,160
I look in vain for you

678
01:00:04,271 --> 01:00:06,865
My love

679
01:00:07,074 --> 01:00:09,338
I try and win you back

680
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:13,475
I try and entice you

681
01:00:14,615 --> 01:00:16,014
The flight...

682
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:25,956
"My eyes fill with tears."

683
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:32,055
"My eyes fill with tears."

684
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:39,239
"My eyes fill with tears."

685
01:00:39,573 --> 01:00:45,341
"My eyes fill with tears."

686
01:00:46,213 --> 01:00:52,049
"My eyes fill with tears."

687
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:57,482
You were right.

688
01:00:58,325 --> 01:01:00,885
My God! But, how?

689
01:01:01,294 --> 01:01:05,355
Ra. One said he'd break
out of the game and find me

690
01:01:10,937 --> 01:01:14,134
"Prateek, this control suit
is for you

691
01:01:14,608 --> 01:01:19,045
"Ra. One is the villain
you wanted. But remember...

692
01:01:19,413 --> 01:01:24,942
"If Ra. One is from evil,
G. One is from my heart"

693
01:01:32,025 --> 01:01:36,519
Millions of rays surround us

694
01:01:37,064 --> 01:01:40,431
Our technology lets
you see the image...

695
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,295
...and touch it

696
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:50,103
"If you ever get into trouble,
G. One will look after you"

697
01:01:50,577 --> 01:01:54,240
Play on the good side,
dude. Love, dad.

698
01:01:55,582 --> 01:01:56,913
Akashi, its Prateek.

699
01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:58,408
Hello.

700
01:01:58,518 --> 01:01:59,951
It's Prateek.

701
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:01,312
Hello, Prateek.

702
01:02:01,521 --> 01:02:02,613
The office.

703
01:02:03,023 --> 01:02:04,081
It's destroyed.

704
01:02:04,291 --> 01:02:05,622
You were here with dad that night.

705
01:02:05,992 --> 01:02:07,084
Did anything happen?

706
01:02:07,327 --> 01:02:08,419
No.

707
01:02:10,097 --> 01:02:11,462
It was pretty quiet.

708
01:02:13,533 --> 01:02:15,524
On the monitor it
says "Lucifer must die"

709
01:02:16,603 --> 01:02:18,161
Who is Lucifer?

710
01:02:18,605 --> 01:02:21,597
It's me, Akashi. That's my
gaming name. Didn't you know?

711
01:02:21,708 --> 01:02:26,168
Lucifer. Prateek. Of course I know.

712
01:02:43,697 --> 01:02:44,959
Akashi.

713
01:02:45,098 --> 01:02:46,190
Who was...

714
01:02:50,203 --> 01:02:52,569
Ra. One has turned into Akashi

715
01:03:00,046 --> 01:03:02,571
I don't like Chinese.

716
01:03:07,587 --> 01:03:09,111
Hello.
- Mom.

717
01:03:09,222 --> 01:03:10,587
Where are you?

718
01:03:11,024 --> 01:03:12,753
I was right. Ra. One killed Dad

719
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:14,554
He's Akashi now

720
01:03:14,661 --> 01:03:17,129
Where are you?

721
01:03:17,330 --> 01:03:18,388
Dad's office

722
01:03:18,598 --> 01:03:19,656
I'm coming

723
01:03:23,703 --> 01:03:25,034
The mainframe!

724
01:03:28,375 --> 01:03:29,672
Prateek. Just hold this.

725
01:03:30,310 --> 01:03:33,006
Connect the laptop to
the mainframe and try to login.

726
01:03:37,417 --> 01:03:38,475
Now log on

727
01:03:39,319 --> 01:03:41,310
Upload Ra. One's backup program

728
01:03:42,422 --> 01:03:43,753
It's missing

729
01:03:44,057 --> 01:03:46,184
No backup program?

730
01:03:47,127 --> 01:03:48,253
We will have to
intercept this program.

731
01:03:48,361 --> 01:03:49,658
How can we stop him?

732
01:03:50,063 --> 01:03:51,325
Has to be some way to stop Ra. One.

733
01:03:51,431 --> 01:03:55,424
"If you ever get into trouble,
G. One will look after you"

734
01:03:55,669 --> 01:03:59,400
There's only one way
to stop Ra. One... G. One

735
01:03:59,673 --> 01:04:02,335
If Ra. One can break out,
so can G. One

736
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:05,202
Right.

737
01:04:05,312 --> 01:04:07,337
Ra. One's latest programs
must be in the mainframe.

738
01:04:07,581 --> 01:04:10,550
We'll copy Ra. One's
data and get G. One out

739
01:04:11,218 --> 01:04:12,515
Load this program.
- Okay.

740
01:04:37,644 --> 01:04:38,736
Damn it.

741
01:04:48,755 --> 01:04:50,450
Hello.
- Jenny, I am here.

742
01:04:50,624 --> 01:04:52,751
Akashi is heading to you

743
01:04:53,627 --> 01:04:54,787
What happened?
- Ra. One.

744
01:04:55,795 --> 01:04:58,593
Sonia called. Ra. One is
on his way. Go, Prateek!

745
01:04:59,232 --> 01:05:00,756
No, I will have to try.

746
01:05:01,134 --> 01:05:03,398
I must release G. One now

747
01:05:03,503 --> 01:05:09,806
Ra. One is looking for you.
Not for me. Please, go

748
01:05:11,511 --> 01:05:12,637
Go!

749
01:05:18,919 --> 01:05:20,352
The HART

750
01:05:44,678 --> 01:05:45,872
Prateek, go

751
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:48,247
Prateek, go

752
01:05:48,682 --> 01:05:49,876
Just go.

753
01:06:06,199 --> 01:06:08,633
Hurry

754
01:06:08,868 --> 01:06:10,301
What is happening, Prateek?

755
01:06:11,638 --> 01:06:13,162
What's going on?
- Let's go.

756
01:06:18,311 --> 01:06:19,505
Mom, faster.

757
01:06:19,612 --> 01:06:22,240
Red light
- Let's go.

758
01:06:22,983 --> 01:06:26,612
- Why is Akashi after us?
- It's Ra. One. Not Akashi

759
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:42,258
Step on it!

760
01:06:42,469 --> 01:06:45,666
What is going on?
- He is after us, mom. Faster.

761
01:07:10,263 --> 01:07:11,491
Mom, faster.

762
01:07:13,466 --> 01:07:14,956
How can Ra. One come out
of the game?

763
01:07:15,268 --> 01:07:16,929
How can he turn into Akashi?
What's going on?

764
01:07:17,303 --> 01:07:18,895
I will tell you later. Drive faster.

765
01:07:43,630 --> 01:07:45,655
- Where is he?
- Don't know

766
01:07:45,765 --> 01:07:46,891
Lost him

767
01:07:49,402 --> 01:07:51,393
He's got a bike

768
01:07:56,509 --> 01:07:57,635
Turn right.

769
01:08:08,054 --> 01:08:10,386
- Where are we?
- Go!

770
01:08:11,758 --> 01:08:12,782
Right turn.

771
01:08:28,541 --> 01:08:29,633
Faster.

772
01:08:30,944 --> 01:08:32,343
Mom.

773
01:08:51,931 --> 01:08:53,091
Prateek.

774
01:08:58,838 --> 01:08:59,964
Mom.

775
01:09:54,127 --> 01:09:55,685
You okay?

776
01:09:55,795 --> 01:09:56,887
Yes. You?

777
01:10:02,735 --> 01:10:03,963
Prateek.

778
01:12:38,324 --> 01:12:40,758
You missed, G. One.

779
01:13:29,142 --> 01:13:31,303
But, mom...
- Enough about Ra. One and G. One.

780
01:13:31,411 --> 01:13:33,003
We're going to India

781
01:13:33,112 --> 01:13:34,636
There's no Ra. One and no G. One.

782
01:13:55,902 --> 01:13:57,335
Dad?

783
01:14:39,079 --> 01:14:40,910
Come on, Prateek. Hurry

784
01:14:41,014 --> 01:14:43,881
We are late.
- Okay, mom. Let's go.

785
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:45,784
Okay, mom. Let's go.

786
01:14:48,521 --> 01:14:50,421
Okay, mom. Let's go.

787
01:14:53,793 --> 01:14:56,523
- Why is he coming?
- G. One saved us

788
01:14:56,629 --> 01:14:58,290
Mom! G. One saved us

789
01:14:58,631 --> 01:15:00,428
Mom! G. One saved us.
- Okay, bye. Thank you.

790
01:15:04,504 --> 01:15:07,337
Nice shirt, dude.
- Nice shirt, dude.

791
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:10,705
- You can't come in that
- Can't come at all

792
01:15:10,810 --> 01:15:12,801
We have to cover him

793
01:15:12,912 --> 01:15:14,311
You have to cover me.

794
01:15:14,814 --> 01:15:15,781
Mom's scarf

795
01:15:15,882 --> 01:15:17,042
Mom's scarf

796
01:15:17,517 --> 01:15:18,643
What are you doing?

797
01:15:19,419 --> 01:15:21,478
Hey you. You can't park there.

798
01:15:24,357 --> 01:15:26,325
I said no parking.

799
01:15:30,930 --> 01:15:32,090
I don't get it

800
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:34,390
Try and understand

801
01:15:34,501 --> 01:15:37,402
Okay, quiet. Quiet.

802
01:15:37,804 --> 01:15:40,466
OK. How do we get this thing...

803
01:15:40,573 --> 01:15:42,632
...past the metal detector?

804
01:15:42,742 --> 01:15:44,937
Prateek, listen

805
01:15:45,412 --> 01:15:47,107
He can't come with us

806
01:15:48,648 --> 01:15:50,946
There's no way.
- There's always a way.

807
01:15:52,952 --> 01:15:55,477
Will he do?

808
01:15:58,525 --> 01:15:59,890
Yes, of course.
- Yes.

809
01:16:01,461 --> 01:16:03,952
Watch! G. One's cool move

810
01:16:05,565 --> 01:16:07,055
What are you doing?

811
01:16:07,434 --> 01:16:08,628
This.

812
01:16:13,039 --> 01:16:15,837
Be like Ra. One

813
01:16:15,942 --> 01:16:17,409
Act like him

814
01:16:18,678 --> 01:16:20,043
I can't...

815
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:22,040
...be him

816
01:16:22,482 --> 01:16:24,040
I'm not as powerful

817
01:16:24,150 --> 01:16:25,412
Protection?

818
01:16:25,518 --> 01:16:26,576
Buttercups!

819
01:16:26,686 --> 01:16:29,382
Prateek, language.
- Sorry, mom.

820
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:31,148
Pants off?

821
01:16:41,501 --> 01:16:42,832
Step aside, sir.

822
01:17:34,888 --> 01:17:36,856
Just go.

823
01:18:16,696 --> 01:18:18,061
I won't go

824
01:18:18,164 --> 01:18:19,722
Some taxi-driver you are

825
01:18:19,832 --> 01:18:22,995
You will take us. That's the rule

826
01:18:23,703 --> 01:18:26,570
I'll take you

827
01:18:26,773 --> 01:18:29,571
Forget his silly taxi. Hop on

828
01:18:29,776 --> 01:18:32,108
Coming?

829
01:18:32,212 --> 01:18:33,270
Rot!

830
01:18:33,580 --> 01:18:34,672
I will take her.

831
01:18:34,781 --> 01:18:37,716
A tight slap for you

832
01:18:37,817 --> 01:18:39,148
We'll take her

833
01:18:39,219 --> 01:18:40,345
Who is it?

834
01:18:45,292 --> 01:18:46,259
Stop that!

835
01:18:46,359 --> 01:18:47,257
He'll die

836
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,692
We'll reset him and press play

837
01:18:49,796 --> 01:18:52,697
He's a man, not a tape recorder

838
01:18:52,799 --> 01:18:54,198
Quiet!

839
01:18:54,301 --> 01:18:55,290
It's no game

840
01:18:55,402 --> 01:18:57,267
If someone dies...

841
01:18:57,571 --> 01:18:59,163
...they don't return

842
01:18:59,573 --> 01:19:00,597
They can

843
01:19:00,707 --> 01:19:02,265
"A man changes outfits

844
01:19:02,375 --> 01:19:04,172
"A soul changes bodies and returns"

845
01:19:04,277 --> 01:19:06,268
Gita. Chapter 2, Verse 22

846
01:19:06,379 --> 01:19:08,574
Page number?

847
01:19:08,682 --> 01:19:09,649
47

848
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:12,275
Tell him to let go

849
01:19:12,385 --> 01:19:14,250
Let go!

850
01:19:17,758 --> 01:19:19,726
Yes.
- What a throw.

851
01:19:32,339 --> 01:19:33,704
Tell him

852
01:19:35,509 --> 01:19:37,272
G. One. No touching.

853
01:19:45,118 --> 01:19:47,586
Fan blades under his feet

854
01:19:48,622 --> 01:19:50,089
No touching.

855
01:19:54,227 --> 01:19:55,421
G. One.

856
01:20:03,870 --> 01:20:06,100
G. One. Stop it.

857
01:20:12,445 --> 01:20:14,504
G. One. No touching.

858
01:20:18,585 --> 01:20:19,711
No touching.

859
01:20:27,594 --> 01:20:29,562
G. One. No touching.

860
01:20:33,667 --> 01:20:34,861
G. One.

861
01:20:43,443 --> 01:20:44,569
Good one.

862
01:21:06,666 --> 01:21:07,826
Idiot.

863
01:21:10,704 --> 01:21:13,195
- You OK?
- I'm fine

864
01:21:13,306 --> 01:21:14,534
Idiot.

865
01:21:28,722 --> 01:21:29,950
You can't touch me there

866
01:21:30,257 --> 01:21:31,224
So where?

867
01:21:31,758 --> 01:21:32,725
Nowhere

868
01:21:32,826 --> 01:21:34,191
How to save you?

869
01:21:34,294 --> 01:21:35,818
No need

870
01:21:36,263 --> 01:21:37,560
Buttercups!

871
01:21:38,531 --> 01:21:41,523
Help me!

872
01:21:43,637 --> 01:21:46,231
G. One.

873
01:21:46,740 --> 01:21:48,367
Do something

874
01:21:48,475 --> 01:21:49,601
I must touch you

875
01:21:49,709 --> 01:21:52,507
Then touch me. Touch me.

876
01:21:52,612 --> 01:21:53,738
Please touch me.
- Okay.

877
01:21:55,515 --> 01:21:56,914
Lower!

878
01:21:59,586 --> 01:22:00,644
Punch him

879
01:22:03,256 --> 01:22:04,382
Lower.

880
01:22:16,036 --> 01:22:19,005
Yummy Mummy. Love at first fight

881
01:22:22,909 --> 01:22:26,367
- She's my Mom
- Mine too

882
01:22:31,451 --> 01:22:32,748
Go, mom.

883
01:23:02,816 --> 01:23:05,717
Mom. Main part.

884
01:23:06,353 --> 01:23:07,786
Main part?

885
01:23:07,887 --> 01:23:09,514
What main part?

886
01:23:13,693 --> 01:23:14,955
Main part.

887
01:23:59,639 --> 01:24:02,073
"Robo man. Robo man."

888
01:24:03,576 --> 01:24:06,067
"Robo man. Robo man."

889
01:24:22,695 --> 01:24:23,957
"Chitti."

890
01:24:25,765 --> 01:24:27,824
"Superhero."

891
01:24:28,902 --> 01:24:30,062
"Chitti."

892
01:24:31,905 --> 01:24:33,839
"Superhero."

893
01:24:33,940 --> 01:24:38,877
- Who is he?
- Our Superhero No. 1

894
01:24:40,947 --> 01:24:42,107
Rajnikanth

895
01:24:52,125 --> 01:24:55,526
I am Chitti. Speed one terahertz.
Memory one zettabyte.

896
01:24:55,962 --> 01:24:59,728
Lord.

897
01:25:21,154 --> 01:25:22,883
"Chitti."

898
01:26:04,731 --> 01:26:06,790
Rajni sir is mind-blowing

899
01:26:07,667 --> 01:26:08,998
Uncle lyer

900
01:26:09,102 --> 01:26:10,694
Surprise visit

901
01:26:11,204 --> 01:26:12,967
Why so shocked?

902
01:26:13,106 --> 01:26:15,870
You're my Dad now.
Say hi to your mate

903
01:26:15,975 --> 01:26:18,944
Hi.
- Hi.

904
01:26:19,045 --> 01:26:21,073
I am pumping while jumping.

905
01:26:21,181 --> 01:26:22,941
I don't like him much.
- You don't like him much.

906
01:26:23,049 --> 01:26:24,880
Bye.

907
01:26:27,187 --> 01:26:28,484
You did that?

908
01:26:28,588 --> 01:26:30,681
No, gravity. Law of attraction.

909
01:26:31,257 --> 01:26:32,781
Hi, Prateek.

910
01:26:33,993 --> 01:26:35,620
Hi.

911
01:26:36,896 --> 01:26:38,591
Hi.

912
01:26:38,998 --> 01:26:41,933
Bye.
- Bye? Why?

913
01:26:42,202 --> 01:26:43,692
Law of attraction.

914
01:26:43,803 --> 01:26:44,861
How are you?

915
01:26:44,971 --> 01:26:47,496
I don't understand.
- Too deep, you go.

916
01:26:47,907 --> 01:26:50,000
Bye.

917
01:27:02,655 --> 01:27:05,749
"The past is behind us.
The future ahead

918
01:27:05,992 --> 01:27:08,961
"Live in the present,
that's all we have"

919
01:27:11,731 --> 01:27:12,891
What was that?

920
01:27:13,833 --> 01:27:17,963
Shekhar programmed me
to memorise proverbs

921
01:27:18,938 --> 01:27:20,030
Any others?

922
01:27:20,139 --> 01:27:25,099
"Those who say big is best haven't
spent a night with a mosquito"

923
01:27:28,014 --> 01:27:29,072
Any more?

924
01:27:30,149 --> 01:27:33,915
"Smile and win my heart.
Cry and I'll be teary-eyed

925
01:27:34,687 --> 01:27:36,154
"Near or far

926
01:27:36,256 --> 01:27:38,121
"I won't leave your side"

927
01:27:40,093 --> 01:27:44,189
I don't get it. If you don't,
can I delete the folder?

928
01:27:44,897 --> 01:27:47,798
No. No.

929
01:27:49,168 --> 01:27:52,069
Never delete that folder

930
01:27:52,705 --> 01:27:54,696
Never. Decision taken

931
01:27:55,341 --> 01:27:58,037
He's a handsome man.

932
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:01,942
Bad hair

933
01:28:06,986 --> 01:28:10,183
The electricity needs reconnecting

934
01:28:11,724 --> 01:28:12,713
Bowls!

935
01:28:12,825 --> 01:28:14,087
You scared me

936
01:28:14,193 --> 01:28:16,093
G. One is on stand-by

937
01:28:16,195 --> 01:28:17,822
Stand-by elsewhere

938
01:28:17,930 --> 01:28:21,957
G. One. Go and make yourself useful.
- Okay.

939
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:29,767
When things settle,
we must do something about him

940
01:28:29,976 --> 01:28:32,103
Why? Can't he live with us?

941
01:28:32,211 --> 01:28:33,735
No. Not at all.

942
01:28:33,846 --> 01:28:36,974
He isn't a TV or toaster
you can leave in a corner

943
01:28:37,350 --> 01:28:39,147
He talks like a human

944
01:28:39,252 --> 01:28:41,311
Looks like Dad, right?

945
01:28:45,758 --> 01:28:50,058
You think G. One was right
about the soul returning?

946
01:28:51,364 --> 01:28:55,357
Dad could be back as G. One,
to protect us

947
01:28:59,672 --> 01:29:03,199
Remember what he'd say
when we were in trouble

948
01:29:05,912 --> 01:29:07,174
Of course I remember.

949
01:29:11,951 --> 01:29:16,650
"When life is dark,
an angel lights a 600-watt bulb"

950
01:29:22,395 --> 01:29:24,022
I've made myself useful.

951
01:29:24,430 --> 01:29:26,660
I charged the inverter.
What to recharge now?

952
01:29:26,766 --> 01:29:28,165
Mom's mood

953
01:29:28,368 --> 01:29:30,893
Mom's mood

954
01:29:32,305 --> 01:29:35,968
Changes your mood instantly

955
01:29:36,075 --> 01:29:40,102
Have you no shame? Talking like
that in front of a kid. Sleep now

956
01:29:40,213 --> 01:29:42,272
I don't sleep. I run

957
01:29:42,382 --> 01:29:43,872
Whatever

958
01:29:43,983 --> 01:29:45,348
Bowls!

959
01:29:45,252 --> 01:29:47,117
Goodnight.
- Yes.

960
01:29:50,090 --> 01:29:52,115
I know what to do with him

961
01:29:52,226 --> 01:29:55,389
We'll send him to
the loony bin. He's nuts

962
01:29:55,829 --> 01:29:59,697
Not totally, Mom.
Just "kondom," a teeny bit

963
01:29:59,967 --> 01:30:03,459
What? How do you know
that word? Come here.

964
01:30:04,004 --> 01:30:06,472
Stop it, mom. Please.

965
01:30:07,141 --> 01:30:10,133
Please. You don't
have to say all that.

966
01:30:10,811 --> 01:30:11,937
Stop it.

967
01:30:35,102 --> 01:30:39,402
"When the night has come.
And the land is dark."

968
01:30:39,973 --> 01:30:44,103
"When the night has come.
And the land is dark."

969
01:30:44,211 --> 01:30:48,511
"And the moon is the only light."

970
01:30:48,982 --> 01:30:51,041
"And the moon is the only light."

971
01:30:52,186 --> 01:30:54,154
"Darling. Darling."

972
01:30:54,254 --> 01:30:58,850
"My guiding light."

973
01:30:59,126 --> 01:31:03,961
"You're my world."

974
01:31:04,465 --> 01:31:07,161
"You're all I want."

975
01:31:07,267 --> 01:31:13,467
"Now and forever."

976
01:31:13,574 --> 01:31:18,011
"My guiding light."

977
01:31:18,345 --> 01:31:23,044
"You're my world."

978
01:31:23,817 --> 01:31:26,012
"Nothing compares..."

979
01:31:26,119 --> 01:31:28,383
"...with your name."

980
01:31:28,489 --> 01:31:33,392
"A thousand books told me so."

981
01:31:33,894 --> 01:31:35,555
"My sweet love."

982
01:31:35,863 --> 01:31:38,354
"The world is nothing without you."

983
01:31:38,832 --> 01:31:40,390
"My sweet love."

984
01:31:40,501 --> 01:31:43,061
"Your generosity melts hearts."

985
01:31:43,570 --> 01:31:45,265
"My sweet love."

986
01:31:45,372 --> 01:31:48,068
"The world is nothing without you."

987
01:31:48,375 --> 01:31:50,104
"My sweet love."

988
01:31:50,210 --> 01:31:52,804
"Your generosity melts hearts."

989
01:31:53,247 --> 01:31:54,976
"My sweet love."

990
01:31:55,082 --> 01:31:57,550
"I won world but
lost my heart to you."

991
01:31:58,051 --> 01:31:59,985
"My sweet love."

992
01:32:00,087 --> 01:32:05,024
"Darling, darling, stand... by me."

993
01:32:05,125 --> 01:32:10,188
"Stand... by me."

994
01:32:11,131 --> 01:32:15,363
"Just as long as you stay."

995
01:32:15,903 --> 01:32:18,269
"Stand... by me."

996
01:32:19,039 --> 01:32:24,238
"Darling, darling, stand... by me."

997
01:32:24,344 --> 01:32:30,214
"Come on stand by me.
- Stand... by me."

998
01:32:30,317 --> 01:32:34,947
"Just as long as you stay."

999
01:32:35,155 --> 01:32:38,090
"Stand... by me."

1000
01:32:41,461 --> 01:32:44,521
It's all my fault

1001
01:32:44,998 --> 01:32:47,558
I told Dad to make a villain...

1002
01:32:47,668 --> 01:32:49,397
...who never loses

1003
01:32:50,003 --> 01:32:54,235
Had I defeated Ra. One,
Dad would be here today

1004
01:32:55,242 --> 01:32:56,607
You're a dude, dad.

1005
01:32:57,277 --> 01:32:58,539
You're a dude, dad.

1006
01:33:02,382 --> 01:33:04,475
No nutritional element in this

1007
01:33:15,362 --> 01:33:17,626
No smoking. Bad for health.

1008
01:33:17,931 --> 01:33:19,125
The pack has a warning

1009
01:33:20,567 --> 01:33:23,627
Thousands quit smoking each year

1010
01:33:23,937 --> 01:33:25,598
So the warning works?

1011
01:33:25,706 --> 01:33:27,230
No. They die

1012
01:33:30,210 --> 01:33:33,236
"When the night is long
and the land is dark."

1013
01:33:35,015 --> 01:33:37,575
"When the moon is the only light."

1014
01:33:39,953 --> 01:33:42,421
"When the night is long
and the land is dark."

1015
01:33:44,958 --> 01:33:46,687
"When the moon is the only light."

1016
01:33:46,994 --> 01:33:50,930
"My sweet love."

1017
01:33:51,264 --> 01:33:55,564
"My prayers are answered."

1018
01:33:56,603 --> 01:34:01,097
"You're all I want."

1019
01:34:01,375 --> 01:34:06,335
"My sweet love."

1020
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:08,511
"My sweet love."

1021
01:34:08,615 --> 01:34:11,345
"The world is nothing without you."

1022
01:34:11,551 --> 01:34:13,348
"My sweet love."

1023
01:34:13,453 --> 01:34:16,354
"Your generosity melts hearts."

1024
01:34:16,456 --> 01:34:18,219
"My sweet love."

1025
01:34:18,325 --> 01:34:20,987
"The world is nothing without you."

1026
01:34:21,294 --> 01:34:23,057
"My sweet love."

1027
01:34:23,163 --> 01:34:26,030
"Your generosity melts hearts."

1028
01:34:26,133 --> 01:34:27,691
"My sweet love."

1029
01:34:28,001 --> 01:34:30,469
"I won the world
when I lost my heart to you."

1030
01:34:30,737 --> 01:34:32,534
My sweet love

1031
01:34:33,073 --> 01:34:38,204
"Darling, darling, stand... by me."

1032
01:34:39,780 --> 01:34:43,580
"Stand... by me."

1033
01:34:44,051 --> 01:34:48,181
"Just as long as you stay."

1034
01:34:48,655 --> 01:34:51,146
"Stand... by me."

1035
01:34:52,192 --> 01:34:55,992
"Darling, darling, stand... by me."

1036
01:34:56,096 --> 01:35:02,501
"Come on stand by me.
- Stand... by me."

1037
01:35:03,236 --> 01:35:07,366
"Just as long as you stay."

1038
01:35:07,808 --> 01:35:10,174
"Stand... by me."

1039
01:35:10,277 --> 01:35:14,543
"Just as long as you stay."

1040
01:35:15,182 --> 01:35:17,377
"Stand... by me."

1041
01:35:17,617 --> 01:35:20,108
"Just as long as you stay."

1042
01:35:20,220 --> 01:35:22,188
"Stand... by me."

1043
01:35:22,456 --> 01:35:25,755
"Stand... by me."

1044
01:35:38,071 --> 01:35:39,163
Just do it.

1045
01:35:42,609 --> 01:35:45,134
Good job, babes.
- You're alright. Thanks.

1046
01:35:59,559 --> 01:36:03,290
Sometimes I think you're human

1047
01:36:10,504 --> 01:36:12,665
G. One. G. One.

1048
01:36:12,773 --> 01:36:14,365
Where are you going? G. One.

1049
01:36:15,442 --> 01:36:16,568
My photo!

1050
01:36:23,183 --> 01:36:24,343
What are you doing?

1051
01:36:24,818 --> 01:36:26,308
Idiot

1052
01:36:26,419 --> 01:36:27,647
You nuts?

1053
01:36:27,754 --> 01:36:29,153
You...

1054
01:36:35,295 --> 01:36:36,626
G. One. G. One. Stop.

1055
01:36:38,899 --> 01:36:41,424
Prateek. G. One.

1056
01:36:47,207 --> 01:36:48,469
My dining table

1057
01:36:48,575 --> 01:36:49,872
Get down.

1058
01:36:50,177 --> 01:36:51,701
Flying bowls

1059
01:36:54,915 --> 01:36:56,405
Flying bowls

1060
01:36:56,683 --> 01:36:58,548
Ok?

1061
01:37:02,222 --> 01:37:03,416
You fool

1062
01:37:05,292 --> 01:37:06,589
Prateek.

1063
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:08,627
Stop!

1064
01:37:09,196 --> 01:37:12,563
Yes.

1065
01:37:16,303 --> 01:37:18,237
What's with him?

1066
01:37:18,572 --> 01:37:20,904
G. One.
- G. One?

1067
01:37:21,208 --> 01:37:22,766
Shekar.

1068
01:37:23,376 --> 01:37:24,707
You hit him?

1069
01:37:31,218 --> 01:37:32,549
Power yoga

1070
01:37:34,454 --> 01:37:36,479
Power yoga!

1071
01:37:36,590 --> 01:37:39,889
Day and night

1072
01:37:40,193 --> 01:37:41,626
Carry on. Carry on.

1073
01:37:41,728 --> 01:37:45,164
Close your door

1074
01:37:45,799 --> 01:37:46,925
Power yoga

1075
01:37:47,834 --> 01:37:49,301
Prateek.

1076
01:37:52,205 --> 01:37:58,769
Power yoga, American style.
Jailalitha!

1077
01:37:58,879 --> 01:38:01,404
Lucifer is controlling me

1078
01:38:01,615 --> 01:38:06,484
Lucifer is controlling me

1079
01:38:09,522 --> 01:38:11,456
Off.

1080
01:38:18,765 --> 01:38:22,565
Something is sticking out
of your nose

1081
01:38:23,970 --> 01:38:25,631
Pull it out, please

1082
01:38:28,575 --> 01:38:31,840
"Secrets are revealed."

1083
01:38:34,314 --> 01:38:37,841
"That was hidden in the heart."

1084
01:38:39,619 --> 01:38:45,251
"It will spread far and wide."

1085
01:38:45,825 --> 01:38:49,625
"Now that the Secrets are revealed."

1086
01:38:51,698 --> 01:38:53,825
"Now that the Secrets are revealed."

1087
01:38:53,934 --> 01:38:56,732
You like it? Keep it.

1088
01:38:57,437 --> 01:39:00,304
Thanks.

1089
01:39:00,407 --> 01:39:01,999
Sonia.

1090
01:39:06,046 --> 01:39:08,480
Good job, babes.

1091
01:41:13,873 --> 01:41:16,774
- Why do you pray?
- So God will protect us

1092
01:41:17,043 --> 01:41:18,977
Does God drop from the sky?

1093
01:41:19,079 --> 01:41:21,138
No. He sends His angels

1094
01:41:21,748 --> 01:41:24,945
Do you believe in angels?

1095
01:41:25,051 --> 01:41:26,643
Shut up and pray.

1096
01:41:30,557 --> 01:41:32,650
There is no God.

1097
01:41:36,629 --> 01:41:37,994
We can fix it

1098
01:41:38,198 --> 01:41:40,894
So what if an engineer dies?

1099
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,059
We have to be the best at
the World Expo

1100
01:41:43,169 --> 01:41:45,399
The game will be ready

1101
01:41:45,672 --> 01:41:49,005
Match found.

1102
01:41:49,476 --> 01:41:51,501
System activated. Welcome.

1103
01:41:51,845 --> 01:41:53,403
Do you understand?

1104
01:42:00,587 --> 01:42:01,713
Who are...

1105
01:42:04,691 --> 01:42:06,056
Who let you in?

1106
01:42:07,527 --> 01:42:09,461
Larry. Who is this man?

1107
01:42:09,729 --> 01:42:11,856
What?

1108
01:42:14,033 --> 01:42:15,159
What's this?

1109
01:42:22,642 --> 01:42:23,734
Who are you?

1110
01:42:28,548 --> 01:42:31,574
Ra. One? From the game?

1111
01:42:33,653 --> 01:42:34,984
Oh my, God.

1112
01:42:35,622 --> 01:42:37,681
There is not God.

1113
01:42:41,127 --> 01:42:42,924
I want Lucifer

1114
01:42:43,630 --> 01:42:45,894
Lucifer

1115
01:42:46,633 --> 01:42:48,225
Shekhar's son

1116
01:42:48,635 --> 01:42:50,466
He has my HART

1117
01:42:50,570 --> 01:42:51,628
Without my HART...

1118
01:42:51,738 --> 01:42:53,137
...I am incomplete.

1119
01:42:53,239 --> 01:42:55,230
My powers are incomplete.

1120
01:42:55,808 --> 01:42:57,503
I want my HART.

1121
01:42:57,944 --> 01:42:59,104
Where's Lucifer?

1122
01:42:59,212 --> 01:43:01,043
They've gone

1123
01:43:01,147 --> 01:43:03,877
I don't know where

1124
01:43:03,983 --> 01:43:06,713
But I...

1125
01:43:06,819 --> 01:43:08,218
What are you doing?

1126
01:43:08,521 --> 01:43:10,785
Electrical impulses.

1127
01:43:11,057 --> 01:43:12,718
Jogging your memory

1128
01:43:13,059 --> 01:43:14,720
No need to do all this.

1129
01:43:17,697 --> 01:43:19,927
I can read...

1130
01:43:20,233 --> 01:43:24,863
...your mind, alter your thoughts

1131
01:43:25,205 --> 01:43:27,673
Control your thoughts

1132
01:43:28,575 --> 01:43:30,907
Shekar Subramaniam, Mumbai. India.

1133
01:43:31,311 --> 01:43:32,903
Thank you very much.

1134
01:43:35,682 --> 01:43:37,547
Have a good day, Mr. Barry.

1135
01:43:38,685 --> 01:43:39,811
You too.

1136
01:43:43,957 --> 01:43:48,758
- Sonia, aren't you coming?
- Yes

1137
01:43:56,069 --> 01:43:58,264
Sonia, what is Karva Chauth?

1138
01:44:01,808 --> 01:44:04,606
When a wife fasts for
her husband's long life

1139
01:44:07,780 --> 01:44:10,146
This house is full
of Shekhar's memories

1140
01:44:12,719 --> 01:44:14,243
That's why I came back

1141
01:44:14,988 --> 01:44:18,583
We can't stay in one place too long

1142
01:44:19,325 --> 01:44:21,088
We must leave

1143
01:44:21,194 --> 01:44:23,059
Ra. One could come anytime

1144
01:44:23,796 --> 01:44:25,627
We have his HART

1145
01:44:27,734 --> 01:44:29,099
So he can find Prateek

1146
01:44:30,303 --> 01:44:31,634
Meaning?

1147
01:44:31,738 --> 01:44:33,763
If we destroy his HART...

1148
01:44:33,873 --> 01:44:35,636
...he'd still chase us

1149
01:44:36,075 --> 01:44:38,270
We'd be running forever

1150
01:44:39,379 --> 01:44:41,006
If we don't destroy it...

1151
01:44:41,114 --> 01:44:42,911
...we must fight him

1152
01:44:43,616 --> 01:44:46,710
Chances of survival, 0.01%.

1153
01:44:49,355 --> 01:44:53,314
This is an emotional decision.
Incompatible with my syntax

1154
01:44:54,627 --> 01:44:56,094
The decision is yours

1155
01:44:59,399 --> 01:45:01,799
This is all I have left

1156
01:45:02,101 --> 01:45:03,966
Prateek, this house...

1157
01:45:04,304 --> 01:45:05,794
...Shekhar's memories

1158
01:45:06,406 --> 01:45:08,033
I can't leave

1159
01:45:09,742 --> 01:45:11,039
I won't run anymore

1160
01:45:11,311 --> 01:45:13,245
Shekhar believed in goodness

1161
01:45:14,681 --> 01:45:17,309
If we've a small
chance of survival...

1162
01:45:17,850 --> 01:45:19,010
...we'll take it

1163
01:45:19,385 --> 01:45:21,319
Even if its 0.01%.

1164
01:45:22,822 --> 01:45:25,086
Decision taken.
- Decision taken.

1165
01:45:26,793 --> 01:45:30,354
Save Prateek from harm

1166
01:45:39,339 --> 01:45:41,034
NaclH2o.

1167
01:45:41,140 --> 01:45:42,698
Salt and water

1168
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:48,747
NaclH2o?

1169
01:45:48,981 --> 01:45:50,346
Tears are confusing

1170
01:45:51,417 --> 01:45:54,853
They flow when you're happy.
Or sad

1171
01:45:56,055 --> 01:45:56,953
Buttercups!

1172
01:45:57,056 --> 01:45:58,148
Buttercups!

1173
01:45:58,825 --> 01:46:00,383
Flow when you're happy...

1174
01:46:00,693 --> 01:46:02,160
Not part of my program

1175
01:46:02,962 --> 01:46:07,365
Emotions and me.
We're at loggerheads

1176
01:46:10,169 --> 01:46:13,332
Those with emotions...

1177
01:46:14,107 --> 01:46:15,972
...would never do...

1178
01:46:16,275 --> 01:46:18,300
...what you've done for us

1179
01:46:19,145 --> 01:46:21,875
Did I go good?

1180
01:46:23,049 --> 01:46:24,243
No.

1181
01:46:26,986 --> 01:46:28,214
You did very good.

1182
01:46:31,991 --> 01:46:36,826
Hug her, you fool!
Power yoga isn't everything

1183
01:46:37,230 --> 01:46:39,130
Go on, hug her

1184
01:46:44,036 --> 01:46:48,905
"Darling, darling, stand... by me."

1185
01:46:49,008 --> 01:46:54,412
"Darling, darling, stand... by me."

1186
01:46:54,881 --> 01:46:59,318
"Stand... by me."

1187
01:46:59,752 --> 01:47:01,777
"Just as long as you stay."

1188
01:47:02,922 --> 01:47:06,323
"Stand... by me."

1189
01:47:07,093 --> 01:47:11,291
"Darling, darling, stand... by me."

1190
01:47:12,465 --> 01:47:15,866
1087

1191
01:47:16,369 --> 01:47:18,735
Precaution.
Uncertain activity in air.

1192
01:47:18,838 --> 01:47:20,305
What is all this?

1193
01:47:21,307 --> 01:47:26,006
Hello. Kingfisher 150.
Do you read me?

1194
01:47:26,112 --> 01:47:27,807
What the hell is that?

1195
01:47:54,340 --> 01:47:55,807
What's this?

1196
01:47:55,908 --> 01:47:58,001
They're burning Raavan

1197
01:48:02,915 --> 01:48:03,381
Why?

1198
01:48:03,483 --> 01:48:05,246
Fool! It's Dussehra

1199
01:48:05,351 --> 01:48:06,978
End of Raavan

1200
01:48:07,086 --> 01:48:08,212
End of evil

1201
01:48:08,321 --> 01:48:10,118
We burn him every year

1202
01:48:10,857 --> 01:48:13,325
You burn him every year...

1203
01:48:13,426 --> 01:48:16,020
...because he never dies

1204
01:48:16,562 --> 01:48:19,087
Hail to Lord Ram!

1205
01:48:19,198 --> 01:48:20,893
Come on.

1206
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,127
Hail to Lord Ram!

1207
01:48:23,236 --> 01:48:26,467
Hail to Lord Ram!

1208
01:48:27,141 --> 01:48:32,168
Those who die - don't need
killing again and again

1209
01:48:59,039 --> 01:49:01,234
You're cool in Dad's clothes

1210
01:49:01,341 --> 01:49:02,069
Thank you.

1211
01:49:02,175 --> 01:49:04,973
Shekhar and lyer celebrate
their kids' birthdays together

1212
01:49:05,145 --> 01:49:06,612
Fatso lyer?

1213
01:49:07,347 --> 01:49:11,044
Everyone knows
Shekhar here. Don't mess up

1214
01:49:11,285 --> 01:49:12,946
Prateek, hurry!

1215
01:49:13,053 --> 01:49:14,987
Bye, I am going.

1216
01:49:15,989 --> 01:49:17,081
Lucifer.
- G. One.

1217
01:49:20,260 --> 01:49:23,161
Shekhar made this game...

1218
01:49:25,265 --> 01:49:27,460
...for Prateek's birthday

1219
01:49:29,469 --> 01:49:33,906
Will you give it to
him on his Dad's behalf?

1220
01:49:34,608 --> 01:49:36,166
He'd like that

1221
01:49:36,443 --> 01:49:37,933
And you?

1222
01:49:40,247 --> 01:49:41,942
I'd like that too

1223
01:49:44,084 --> 01:49:46,245
Okay, then. Decision taken.

1224
01:49:46,987 --> 01:49:48,454
Lucifer.

1225
01:50:07,007 --> 01:50:08,338
Happy birthday, Prateek.

1226
01:50:09,209 --> 01:50:10,471
From Dad

1227
01:50:13,213 --> 01:50:15,113
No. From you

1228
01:50:16,283 --> 01:50:17,375
Okay.

1229
01:50:18,552 --> 01:50:22,488
A show for all the kids!

1230
01:50:22,589 --> 01:50:25,456
Come, Prateek.

1231
01:50:26,293 --> 01:50:31,356
As usual, Shekhar will dance

1232
01:50:32,132 --> 01:50:33,394
Dance?

1233
01:50:33,967 --> 01:50:35,161
Not today

1234
01:50:35,268 --> 01:50:42,037
No excuses. He'll dance for you.
You're looking so...

1235
01:50:43,143 --> 01:50:44,508
What's the word in Punjabi?

1236
01:50:44,611 --> 01:50:46,442
Firecracker?

1237
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:48,445
Sexy number?

1238
01:50:50,384 --> 01:50:51,942
Hot chick?

1239
01:50:53,020 --> 01:50:54,112
"Sizzling siren"

1240
01:50:54,221 --> 01:50:55,415
"Sizzling siren"

1241
01:50:55,522 --> 01:50:57,251
Let's start

1242
01:51:02,562 --> 01:51:04,655
Prateek.

1243
01:51:04,765 --> 01:51:07,097

1245
01:51:33,326 --> 01:51:35,351

"Where you go, girl,

1247
01:51:40,500 --> 01:51:42,730
"What you want,

01:51:44,237 --> 01:51:46,364
"My sizzling siren."

1249
01:51:47,541 --> 01:51:51,068
"Surely I am gonna get you?"

1250
01:51:51,178 --> 01:51:52,406
"You know I am gonna get you."

"My sizzling siren."

1281
01:54:39,713 --> 01:54:41,704
"My sizzling siren."

1282
01:54:43,450 --> 01:54:45,384
"My sizzling siren."

1283
01:54:46,920 --> 01:54:48,945
"My sizzling siren."

1284
01:54:50,557 --> 01:54:52,752
"My sizzling siren."

1285
01:55:05,005 --> 01:55:06,438
Ra. One is near

1286
01:55:06,539 --> 01:55:08,302
Take Prateek and go!

1287
01:55:08,875 --> 01:55:10,240
Just go.

1288
01:55:33,900 --> 01:55:35,868
Why isn't G. One here?

1289
01:55:36,536 --> 01:55:38,868
Ra. One scared him off

1290
01:55:40,307 --> 01:55:43,242
Mom, let's go back. We need G. One

1291
01:55:44,511 --> 01:55:48,277
We don't need him. He needs us

1292
01:55:48,381 --> 01:55:49,575
Where are we going?

1293
01:55:49,683 --> 01:55:51,310
To hell!

1294
01:55:52,419 --> 01:55:53,818
Don't be scared

1295
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:56,787
Till your hero returns my HART...

1296
01:55:57,424 --> 01:56:00,985
...I won't kill you

1297
01:56:01,695 --> 01:56:02,855
Sonny!

1298
01:56:22,349 --> 01:56:24,317
Honey, I am home.

1299
01:56:26,987 --> 01:56:28,682
Boo. Got you.

1300
01:56:28,788 --> 01:56:31,018
They aren't part of the game

1301
01:56:31,324 --> 01:56:32,655
They weren't...

1302
01:56:34,461 --> 01:56:35,951
...but you made them

1303
01:56:36,062 --> 01:56:37,324
Where are they?

1304
01:56:37,430 --> 01:56:38,624
Sonia

1305
01:56:52,078 --> 01:56:53,875
is in my control

1306
01:56:59,586 --> 01:57:02,987
Sonia is on a train that
never stops

1307
01:57:07,961 --> 01:57:09,588
Lucifer is held hostage...

1308
01:57:09,696 --> 01:57:13,655
...at the game launch exhibition

1309
01:57:25,445 --> 01:57:26,844
Come, save them

1310
01:57:26,946 --> 01:57:29,346
Logic says you'll return my HART...

1311
01:57:29,449 --> 01:57:30,814
...and save Lucifer

1312
01:57:31,584 --> 01:57:33,051
Emotions say...

1313
01:57:33,153 --> 01:57:34,552
...you'll save Sonia

1314
01:57:34,654 --> 01:57:36,417
Who will you choose?

1315
01:57:36,623 --> 01:57:38,887
Sonia or Lucifer.

1316
01:57:39,459 --> 01:57:40,790
Your train has left...

1317
01:57:40,894 --> 01:57:41,861
...the station

1318
01:57:41,961 --> 01:57:44,555
I won't wait long

1319
01:57:45,131 --> 01:57:46,496
Your time starts now.

1320
01:57:46,599 --> 01:57:49,466
Tick-tock.

1321
01:58:11,591 --> 01:58:14,389
Running about, not allowed

1322
01:58:18,932 --> 01:58:20,160
Oh no.

1323
01:58:27,207 --> 01:58:34,409
"Wicked Speed. The destination ahead,
the wind at my back."

1324
01:58:37,884 --> 01:58:40,011
Oh, God.
- Excuse me.

1325
01:58:40,120 --> 01:58:42,054
Toilet trips, not allowed

1326
01:58:42,155 --> 01:58:43,884
Missing school, not allowed.

1327
01:58:43,990 --> 01:58:47,448
Talking to anyone,
or eating lunch, not allowed.

1328
01:58:47,660 --> 01:58:49,855
And hanging from
the train's roof, teacher?

1329
01:58:49,963 --> 01:58:51,624
Not allowed.

1330
01:58:52,565 --> 01:58:54,192
Oh my, God. Monkey man.

1331
01:58:54,501 --> 01:58:56,560
No entry. Children only

1332
01:58:56,669 --> 01:59:00,002
Just get out. Please.

1333
01:59:04,110 --> 01:59:06,670
Kids. Don't try this at home.

1334
01:59:06,980 --> 01:59:09,005
Not allowed.
- Do you wish to die?

1335
01:59:09,582 --> 01:59:16,181
"Wicked Speed. The destination ahead,
the wind at my back."

1336
01:59:20,527 --> 01:59:27,524
"A chilling gale, crosses
your path, it stops you."

1337
01:59:34,641 --> 01:59:36,973
A man is leaping about the train!	

1338
01:59:37,076 --> 01:59:39,943
The train didn't stop

1339
01:59:40,046 --> 01:59:42,514
Contact the station master. Patil.
Contact the motorman.

1340
02:00:06,774 --> 02:00:07,900
Move back. The train is coming.

1341
02:00:08,008 --> 02:00:09,202
The train isn't stopping anywhere

1342
02:00:09,310 --> 02:00:11,141
What now?
- I don't know.

1343
02:00:16,050 --> 02:00:17,244
I am sorry.

1344
02:00:17,751 --> 02:00:21,710
Leave me. Leave me.

1345
02:00:26,660 --> 02:00:29,288
The train isn't stopping

1346
02:00:29,797 --> 02:00:32,288
Divert the train's route.

1347
02:00:32,600 --> 02:00:35,763
Wait, wait.

1348
02:00:36,303 --> 02:00:40,535
The train isn't stopping

1349
02:00:43,177 --> 02:00:46,704
"Time has... chosen a moment."
"I will leave a mark in history.

1350
02:00:46,814 --> 02:00:49,647
"Wicked Speed."

1351
02:00:49,750 --> 02:00:53,618
There's a bomb on the train.
Time-bomb.

1352
02:00:58,692 --> 02:01:00,592
Get inside.
- Duck.

1353
02:01:00,694 --> 02:01:04,562
"A chilling gale, crosses
your path, it stops you."

1354
02:01:09,069 --> 02:01:11,299
There's a bomb.

1355
02:01:28,722 --> 02:01:30,087
I think there's been a blast.

1356
02:01:30,758 --> 02:01:33,056
"There's no fun when."

1357
02:01:34,194 --> 02:01:37,755
"Life isn't on the edge."

1358
02:01:41,669 --> 02:01:44,695
"A strong heart."

1359
02:01:45,039 --> 02:01:48,372
"Never accepts defeat easily."

1360
02:01:48,876 --> 02:01:52,073
"Doing that unimaginable."

1361
02:01:52,379 --> 02:01:55,871
"Is the mark of the brave."

1362
02:01:55,983 --> 02:01:59,646
"I don't do it for myself."

1363
02:01:59,753 --> 02:02:03,120
"I lay my life down for my kin."

1364
02:02:03,223 --> 02:02:05,987
"Wicked Speed."

1365
02:02:06,093 --> 02:02:09,995
"The destination ahead,
the wind at my back."

1366
02:03:18,265 --> 02:03:19,425
Come on. Quick.

1367
02:03:46,527 --> 02:03:48,154
"Glory to You."

1368
02:03:50,197 --> 02:03:51,721
"Glory to You."

1369
02:03:53,867 --> 02:03:57,166
"Glory to Lord Ganesha."

1370
02:03:57,271 --> 02:04:00,263
"Glory to Lord Ganesha."

1371
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:01,968
Prateek.
- He'll be fine

1372
02:05:03,403 --> 02:05:05,166
Will you save Prateek?

1373
02:05:05,272 --> 02:05:06,364
Of course.

1374
02:05:07,107 --> 02:05:10,133
I was created to save your son

1375
02:05:16,416 --> 02:05:20,944
"Sweetheart."

1376
02:05:21,922 --> 02:05:23,287
Promise me

1377
02:05:27,394 --> 02:05:29,419
I promise you

1378
02:05:33,367 --> 02:05:35,392
I must go

1379
02:05:35,502 --> 02:05:40,098
I have to go alone

1380
02:05:53,086 --> 02:05:54,519
G. One.

1381
02:05:55,322 --> 02:05:58,917
You once asked me if angels existed

1382
02:06:01,662 --> 02:06:03,129
Now I know...

1383
02:06:04,531 --> 02:06:05,896
...that they do

1384
02:06:05,999 --> 02:06:10,561
"Your generosity melts hearts."

1385
02:06:52,079 --> 02:06:54,343
I am here, G. One

1386
02:07:36,023 --> 02:07:38,116
You are late, G. One.

1387
02:07:38,692 --> 02:07:41,627
Any later and...

1388
02:07:43,430 --> 02:07:46,126
I have your HART

1389
02:07:46,233 --> 02:07:47,700
So you can't kill Prateek

1390
02:07:48,001 --> 02:07:50,265
You have my HART so...

1391
02:07:50,370 --> 02:07:52,304
...you can't kill me

1392
02:07:52,572 --> 02:07:55,735
Unless our HARTS are connected...

1393
02:07:56,176 --> 02:07:57,609
...you can't die...

1394
02:07:58,412 --> 02:07:59,640
...nor can I

1395
02:08:00,681 --> 02:08:02,444
I must log on

1396
02:08:02,783 --> 02:08:06,583
I hope it's connected with the LAN.
Give me display control, come on.

1397
02:08:08,588 --> 02:08:12,183
But matters of the
heart... very complicated.

1398
02:08:12,292 --> 02:08:13,623
For me it's simple

1399
02:08:14,327 --> 02:08:17,990
My only purpose is to destroy you

1400
02:08:19,099 --> 02:08:20,293
Keep the HART

1401
02:08:20,400 --> 02:08:24,393
Logic says: Your chance of
survival is 0.01%

1402
02:08:24,504 --> 02:08:25,493
Why choose death?

1403
02:08:25,605 --> 02:08:29,132
Because I gave my word

1404
02:09:16,156 --> 02:09:17,623
We're connected

1405
02:09:17,724 --> 02:09:21,057
Connected now.
- Ra. One loaded. Game ready to play.

1406
02:09:21,161 --> 02:09:23,561
Game begins.
- Welcome, Lucifer.

1407
02:09:24,431 --> 02:09:25,796
Let's play.

1408
02:09:44,584 --> 02:09:46,449
Hide!

1409
02:09:50,157 --> 02:09:51,681
You OK?

1410
02:09:51,858 --> 02:09:53,587
Sure, I'm fine

1411
02:09:54,361 --> 02:09:56,329
But my head is spinning

1412
02:11:01,962 --> 02:11:03,190
Fire.

1413
02:11:03,296 --> 02:11:03,887
Done!

1414
02:11:04,197 --> 02:11:05,391
Look down!

1415
02:11:19,880 --> 02:11:23,782
G. One safe. Level two, killer combat.

1416
02:11:23,884 --> 02:11:25,909
Good going, G. One.
- This is good going?

1417
02:11:26,219 --> 02:11:28,847
The plan is to get to Level 3

1418
02:11:29,256 --> 02:11:32,419
Great plan. That's if Ra. One lets us

1419
02:11:32,525 --> 02:11:35,323
Survive two minutes more

1420
02:12:04,925 --> 02:12:07,325
- What are you doing?
- Getting whipped

1421
02:12:08,962 --> 02:12:12,398
Don't fight. Just try to survive

1422
02:12:13,967 --> 02:12:15,662
Watch me

1423
02:12:29,816 --> 02:12:30,840
See?

1424
02:12:30,951 --> 02:12:33,419
No, G. One. Do it my way.

1425
02:12:48,735 --> 02:12:50,930
One minute to go.

1426
02:13:01,681 --> 02:13:03,308
Use Ra. One's power

1427
02:13:03,416 --> 02:13:04,474
Okay.

1428
02:13:07,620 --> 02:13:08,678
Yes.

1429
02:13:09,489 --> 02:13:10,717
Oh no.

1430
02:13:11,825 --> 02:13:13,053
Duck.

1431
02:13:25,772 --> 02:13:27,569
Don't fight. Survive

1432
02:13:28,008 --> 02:13:29,771
No, no, no, don't.

1433
02:13:35,582 --> 02:13:37,413
Energy levels low.

1434
02:13:37,951 --> 02:13:39,578
Run!

1435
02:14:08,848 --> 02:14:11,783
Grab his main part!

1436
02:14:18,124 --> 02:14:20,524
What are you doing, G. One?

1437
02:14:20,927 --> 02:14:22,485
I don't know.

1438
02:14:22,762 --> 02:14:25,526
Level 2 clear. G. One survives.

1439
02:14:25,698 --> 02:14:27,495
G. One safe.
- Yes.

1440
02:14:33,873 --> 02:14:34,965
G. One.

1441
02:14:35,575 --> 02:14:37,133
You OK?

1442
02:14:38,478 --> 02:14:40,844
Never felt better.

1443
02:14:40,947 --> 02:14:45,782
I'm in your world now.
We start where we left off

1444
02:14:46,619 --> 02:14:48,814
So come on our Lucifer.

1445
02:14:49,923 --> 02:14:52,721
My power has decreased.
Ra. One is stronger now

1446
02:14:52,826 --> 02:14:55,522
One gun, one bullet, one chance

1447
02:14:55,628 --> 02:14:59,394
You can't hide from me.
Or escape me

1448
02:14:59,666 --> 02:15:01,531
How will we destroy Ra. One?

1449
02:15:02,635 --> 02:15:05,763
Bullets don't win wars. Hearts do

1450
02:15:05,872 --> 02:15:06,998
Now my HART...

1451
02:15:09,075 --> 02:15:11,066
"Sweetheart."

1452
02:15:12,679 --> 02:15:15,842
...will be my strength,
not my weakness

1453
02:15:17,817 --> 02:15:19,409
Let's do this, Prateek.

1454
02:15:20,687 --> 02:15:21,779
For your father

1455
02:15:23,123 --> 02:15:25,421
"Sweetheart."

1456
02:15:57,690 --> 02:15:59,851
Anti-heart gun activated.

1457
02:16:51,144 --> 02:16:52,839
G. One.

1458
02:16:56,182 --> 02:16:57,547
G. One. HART.

1459
02:17:02,222 --> 02:17:04,782
You said it'd work

1460
02:17:05,092 --> 02:17:06,582
You can't die

1461
02:17:08,161 --> 02:17:11,096
G. One terminated.
Game over, Lucifer.

1462
02:17:11,198 --> 02:17:13,291
Get ready to die

1463
02:17:22,175 --> 02:17:23,506
I am on.

1464
02:17:24,311 --> 02:17:25,505
We're ready

1465
02:17:25,612 --> 02:17:27,671
To kick your...
- Language, Prateek.

1466
02:17:28,815 --> 02:17:32,410
We are ready, to kick your fat ass.

1467
02:17:32,519 --> 02:17:33,679
You forget

1468
02:17:33,787 --> 02:17:38,053
If we're not connected to
the HART, neither of us...

1469
02:17:38,158 --> 02:17:39,318
...can die

1470
02:17:39,426 --> 02:17:42,156
Matters of the heart.
Very complicated.

1471
02:17:42,262 --> 02:17:45,288
I didn't forget. Lucifer did

1472
02:17:45,398 --> 02:17:48,162
He wanted a villain who never loses

1473
02:17:48,268 --> 02:17:50,429
You should be careful
what you wish for, kid.

1474
02:17:50,704 --> 02:17:54,265
Instead of one villain,
you have ten

1475
02:17:59,346 --> 02:18:00,540
Oh no.
- Shoot me.

1476
02:18:00,647 --> 02:18:02,547
Find me

1477
02:18:02,649 --> 02:18:06,449
Find the real Ra. One

1478
02:18:06,553 --> 02:18:08,612
- Which one?
- Never got to Level 3

1479
02:18:08,722 --> 02:18:10,622
One real. Nine fakes

1480
02:18:11,258 --> 02:18:14,659
Me!

1481
02:18:15,295 --> 02:18:18,355
No, me

1482
02:18:43,557 --> 02:18:44,888
Impossible

1483
02:18:45,192 --> 02:18:46,887
Dad can't let evil win

1484
02:18:51,731 --> 02:18:54,291
He'll help us

1485
02:18:57,537 --> 02:18:58,629
I have his folder

1486
02:18:58,738 --> 02:19:00,205
Check it

1487
02:19:00,307 --> 02:19:02,275
His last proverb:

1488
02:19:02,375 --> 02:19:05,902
"Sell your soul to the Devil and
evil's shadow won't leave you"

1489
02:19:06,213 --> 02:19:07,544
Shadow?

1490
02:19:10,917 --> 02:19:12,407
Shadow?

1491
02:19:12,519 --> 02:19:13,577
The real Ra. One...

1492
02:19:13,687 --> 02:19:14,711
...casts a shadow

1493
02:19:14,821 --> 02:19:16,880
The real Ra. One casts a shadow

1494
02:19:21,494 --> 02:19:23,462
The real Ra. One casts a shadow

1495
02:19:23,563 --> 02:19:24,757
Shoot.

1496
02:20:59,292 --> 02:21:00,486
G. One.

1497
02:21:05,031 --> 02:21:08,933
Game over, Prateek. I must go

1498
02:21:09,436 --> 02:21:12,496
No, G. One. That wasn't the plan

1499
02:21:12,973 --> 02:21:17,034
It was the plan and always will be

1500
02:21:17,577 --> 02:21:20,011
If you want the end of Ra. One...

1501
02:21:20,647 --> 02:21:21,978
...I must take him back...

1502
02:21:22,082 --> 02:21:24,312
...to the world...

1503
02:21:24,985 --> 02:21:26,748
...from where we came

1504
02:21:29,489 --> 02:21:31,514
G. One, don't leave me

1505
02:21:31,624 --> 02:21:33,819
I can't lose my father again

1506
02:21:34,461 --> 02:21:37,760
You'll never lose him

1507
02:21:38,999 --> 02:21:44,631
If there's goodness in your heart,
he'll never leave you

1508
02:21:46,773 --> 02:21:48,502
Good people die...

1509
02:21:50,110 --> 02:21:52,374
...but their goodness lives on

1510
02:22:02,856 --> 02:22:04,380
Listen to your heart.

1511
02:22:05,892 --> 02:22:09,384
Look. Be a superhero, Prateek.

1512
02:22:09,963 --> 02:22:13,490
A superhero. With a heart.

1513
02:22:25,512 --> 02:22:26,672
Got to go now.

1514
02:22:28,114 --> 02:22:31,948
I will miss you, G. One.
- Yes.

1515
02:22:33,553 --> 02:22:35,418
I think I will miss you too.

1516
02:22:36,022 --> 02:22:37,512
Tell Sonia...

1517
02:22:38,058 --> 02:22:44,088
We made a real
buttercup of brother Ra. One

1518
02:24:06,713 --> 02:24:08,772
So glad you're back

1519
02:24:09,716 --> 02:24:10,842
You OK?

1520
02:24:10,950 --> 02:24:12,008
You know I am very happy
that you two returned.

1521
02:24:12,118 --> 02:24:13,210
How's Prateek?

1522
02:24:13,520 --> 02:24:17,149
Forever logged on,
trying to revive G. One's HART

1523
02:24:32,839 --> 02:24:34,204
Just let him be, Sonia.

1524
02:24:35,108 --> 02:24:36,166
Don't dash his hopes

1525
02:24:36,276 --> 02:24:37,709
It's his belief.

1526
02:24:37,810 --> 02:24:39,675
Where is my Lucifer?

1527
02:24:40,547 --> 02:24:42,879
Prateek.
- Coming, mom.

1528
02:24:48,788 --> 02:24:49,982
I am on.

1529
02:25:19,752 --> 02:25:21,777
Mom, G. One's back.

1530
02:25:22,055 --> 02:25:26,925
I told you, Mom! He'd come back
He's right here. He's back.
