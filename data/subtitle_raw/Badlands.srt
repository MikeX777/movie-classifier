1
00:00:26,738 --> 00:00:29,673
My mother died of pneumonia
when I was just a kid.

2
00:00:29,741 --> 00:00:33,677
My father had kept their wedding cake
in the freezer for ten whole years.

3
00:00:33,745 --> 00:00:36,680
After the funeral he gave it
to the yard man.

4
00:00:36,848 --> 00:00:39,612
He tried to act cheerful,
but he could never be consoled...

5
00:00:39,685 --> 00:00:42,415
...by the little stranger
he found in his house.

6
00:00:42,554 --> 00:00:47,457
Then, one day, hoping to begin a new life
away from the scene offal his memories...

7
00:00:47,926 --> 00:00:51,327
...he moved us from Texas
to Fort Dupree, South Dakota.

8
00:01:34,172 --> 00:01:36,606
I'll give you a dollar to eat this Collie.

9
00:01:42,814 --> 00:01:44,839
I ain't gonna eat him for a dollar.

10
00:01:46,885 --> 00:01:48,910
I don't think he's a Collie either.

11
00:01:49,121 --> 00:01:50,782
Some kind of dog, though.

12
00:01:52,758 --> 00:01:53,850
Watch your head.

13
00:02:00,232 --> 00:02:01,324
Hey, Woody!

14
00:02:02,134 --> 00:02:03,499
Give me a cigarette!

15
00:02:07,472 --> 00:02:09,440
Woody wouldn't give me a cigarette.

16
00:02:11,743 --> 00:02:13,802
Ever notice he don't talk much?

17
00:02:14,046 --> 00:02:16,913
Yeah, he's not a talker. You got that.

18
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:23,517
Little did I realize, what began in the alleys
and back ways of this quiet town...

19
00:02:23,822 --> 00:02:26,655
...would end in the Badlands of Montana.

20
00:02:28,593 --> 00:02:30,823
-No, they wouldn't fit.
-You haven't tried 'em on.

21
00:02:30,896 --> 00:02:33,228
-No, no. What size are they?
-Your size.

22
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:35,623
-Come on, give me a dollar for 'em.
-No.

23
00:02:35,767 --> 00:02:37,564
They cost $20 new.

24
00:02:40,906 --> 00:02:42,999
Why don't you see if they fit you?

25
00:02:55,887 --> 00:02:58,219
This lady don't ever pay her bills.

26
00:03:00,358 --> 00:03:03,088
She's gonna get in trouble
if she doesn't watch out.

27
00:03:12,971 --> 00:03:16,463
I throwed enough trash for today, Cato.
I'll see you in the morning.

28
00:03:18,777 --> 00:03:19,766
Catch!

29
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:22,012
What do you mean?

30
00:04:19,171 --> 00:04:20,160
Hi.

31
00:04:20,505 --> 00:04:21,836
I'm Kit.

32
00:04:21,907 --> 00:04:24,398
I'm not keepin' you
from anything important, am l?

33
00:04:24,476 --> 00:04:25,135
No.

34
00:04:25,911 --> 00:04:28,539
Just thought I'd come over
and say hello to you.

35
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,479
I'll try anything once.

36
00:04:34,452 --> 00:04:36,113
What's your name? I said mine.

37
00:04:36,521 --> 00:04:37,351
Holly.

38
00:04:39,057 --> 00:04:40,718
Well listen, Holly....

39
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:44,851
You, I don't know....
You want to take a walk with me?

40
00:04:46,231 --> 00:04:47,391
What for?

41
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,660
I got some stuff to say.

42
00:04:50,101 --> 00:04:52,069
Guess I'm kind of lucky that way.

43
00:04:52,137 --> 00:04:54,867
Most people don't have anything
on their minds, do they?

44
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:02,004
Incidentally, my last name is Carruthers.

45
00:05:03,215 --> 00:05:05,547
Sounds a little too much like "druthers."

46
00:05:05,617 --> 00:05:06,914
It's okay.

47
00:05:07,485 --> 00:05:10,283
Yeah, well nobody asked me
what I thought.

48
00:05:10,422 --> 00:05:12,185
They just hung it on me.

49
00:05:14,893 --> 00:05:16,656
You still in school?

50
00:05:17,095 --> 00:05:18,892
No, I got me a job.

51
00:05:19,564 --> 00:05:20,929
Doin' what?

52
00:05:21,499 --> 00:05:25,731
Well, I don't mind gettin' up early
so I got a job throwing garbage.

53
00:05:27,105 --> 00:05:28,037
Holly!

54
00:05:28,106 --> 00:05:30,006
I'm not in love with the stuff, okay?

55
00:05:30,075 --> 00:05:31,975
That's my father. I gotta run.

56
00:05:32,043 --> 00:05:33,203
Hey, wait!

57
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,903
When am I gonna see you again?

58
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:39,644
Well, I know what my daddy's gonna say.

59
00:05:39,718 --> 00:05:40,707
What?

60
00:05:40,785 --> 00:05:41,877
Can I be honest?

61
00:05:42,387 --> 00:05:43,376
Sure.

62
00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:48,589
Well, that I shouldn't be seen
with anybody that collects garbage.

63
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,888
He'll say that?

64
00:05:50,795 --> 00:05:51,625
Yeah.

65
00:05:52,297 --> 00:05:54,094
Now what's he know about garbage?

66
00:05:54,766 --> 00:05:55,733
Nothin'.

67
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,233
There you go.

68
00:05:57,636 --> 00:06:01,299
I mean, there's nothin' he wants to know.
I gotta run.

69
00:06:09,481 --> 00:06:10,880
Who was that?

70
00:06:11,049 --> 00:06:12,448
Just some boy.

71
00:06:14,286 --> 00:06:16,220
Is that gonna kill the grass?

72
00:06:18,723 --> 00:06:20,623
You got some on my feet!

73
00:06:21,927 --> 00:06:23,417
What'd he want?

74
00:06:23,561 --> 00:06:26,086
He was just askin' if we needed
any yard work done.

75
00:06:29,401 --> 00:06:32,427
I said, "No." And for him not to bother us.

76
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,539
Heard the news, Kit?

77
00:06:41,913 --> 00:06:42,709
No.

78
00:06:43,581 --> 00:06:45,048
Been in all the headlines.

79
00:06:46,818 --> 00:06:47,807
What's that?

80
00:06:47,886 --> 00:06:49,217
You've been fired.

81
00:06:49,721 --> 00:06:51,450
Ain't that a hell of a note?

82
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:56,188
Yeah, how about that?

83
00:06:57,262 --> 00:07:00,026
I wouldn't be needin' my keys anymore.

84
00:07:00,098 --> 00:07:02,623
I'll just leave 'em
where they'll be nice and handy.

85
00:07:06,938 --> 00:07:08,235
I've got my dog.

86
00:07:10,241 --> 00:07:12,232
Have you ever held another job before?

87
00:07:13,545 --> 00:07:16,480
Yeah, I used to throw trash for the city.

88
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:19,514
And you lost that one?

89
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:22,648
Yeah, I wouldn't be here if I hadn't.

90
00:07:24,022 --> 00:07:25,421
Why did you leave?

91
00:07:27,025 --> 00:07:28,117
Just felt like it.

92
00:07:29,627 --> 00:07:32,528
What kind of work do you think
you'd be qualified for?

93
00:07:32,597 --> 00:07:34,360
I just gotta get this.

94
00:07:39,504 --> 00:07:42,632
Well, I can't think of anything
at the moment.

95
00:07:45,543 --> 00:07:49,843
I want you to write me out a slip though,
provin' I came down here.

96
00:07:52,884 --> 00:07:56,047
I think we can get you something.
Workin' cattle over at the pens.

97
00:08:01,026 --> 00:08:02,653
Yeah, what the hell.

98
00:08:03,628 --> 00:08:05,619
Just hope there's a breeze.

99
00:08:14,072 --> 00:08:16,734
He was handsomer
than anybody I'd ever met.

100
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:19,173
He looked just like James Dean.

101
00:08:21,146 --> 00:08:22,135
Hi.

102
00:08:22,347 --> 00:08:24,076
Well, stop the world.

103
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,512
Hey, quit my job.

104
00:08:26,584 --> 00:08:27,573
Great.

105
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,049
Seemed like the right move.
What'cha doing?

106
00:08:31,222 --> 00:08:32,246
Spanish.

107
00:08:33,058 --> 00:08:35,754
How do you say:
"Quit my job," in Spanish?

108
00:08:36,261 --> 00:08:38,092
Something...mi trabajo.

109
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,323
Well, I'm goin' to work as a cowboy now.

110
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,958
Thinkin' about it.

111
00:08:46,504 --> 00:08:48,438
It's a routine like anything.

112
00:08:49,774 --> 00:08:51,105
What do you think?

113
00:08:51,543 --> 00:08:52,567
I don't know.

114
00:08:53,611 --> 00:08:57,707
Yeah, well, at least nobody can get on me
about wearin' these boots anymore.

115
00:09:05,123 --> 00:09:07,057
You want to go for a ride?

116
00:09:10,395 --> 00:09:12,056
Well, I got homework.

117
00:09:14,065 --> 00:09:15,555
Bring it along.

118
00:09:20,338 --> 00:09:22,738
Somebody dropped a bag on the sidewalk.

119
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,843
If everybody did that,
the whole town'd be a mess.

120
00:09:33,218 --> 00:09:34,207
Hi.

121
00:09:36,554 --> 00:09:37,987
You're a redhead.

122
00:09:38,056 --> 00:09:39,114
I know.

123
00:09:40,525 --> 00:09:42,425
Anybody ever call you "Red"?

124
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,059
Yeah, but I don't like it.

125
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:45,118
Why not?

126
00:09:46,331 --> 00:09:47,730
I just don't.

127
00:09:50,502 --> 00:09:51,662
I got a headache.

128
00:09:51,736 --> 00:09:52,964
Oh, yeah?

129
00:10:03,715 --> 00:10:05,740
Can I come around and see you tomorrow?

130
00:10:05,817 --> 00:10:06,841
Okay.

131
00:10:18,596 --> 00:10:22,362
Kit went to work in the feedlot
while I carried on with my studies.

132
00:10:22,467 --> 00:10:24,526
Little by little, we fell in love.

133
00:10:24,903 --> 00:10:28,999
As I'd never been popular in school,
and didn't have a lot of personality...

134
00:10:29,073 --> 00:10:31,598
...l was surprised that he took
such a likin' to me.

135
00:10:31,876 --> 00:10:34,106
Especially when he could've had
any other girl...

136
00:10:34,179 --> 00:10:35,840
...if hed given it half a try.

137
00:10:38,316 --> 00:10:41,945
He said that I was grand, though.
He wasn't interested in me for sex...

138
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,588
...and that comin' from him,
this was a compliment.

139
00:10:44,656 --> 00:10:47,887
He'd never met a 15-year-old girl
who'd behaved like a grownup...

140
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:49,449
...and wasn't giggly.

141
00:10:49,561 --> 00:10:51,688
He didn't care what anybody else thought.

142
00:10:51,763 --> 00:10:54,323
I looked good to him
and whatever I did was okay.

143
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,957
And if I didn't have a lot to say...

144
00:10:56,034 --> 00:10:58,161
...well that was okay, too.

145
00:11:00,738 --> 00:11:02,399
What a nice place.

146
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:06,704
Yeah, the tree makes it nice.

147
00:11:07,612 --> 00:11:09,045
And the flowers.

148
00:11:10,748 --> 00:11:12,215
Let's not pick 'em.

149
00:11:13,851 --> 00:11:15,318
They're so nice.

150
00:11:17,355 --> 00:11:18,822
It's your play.

151
00:11:21,726 --> 00:11:24,752
Of course, I had to keep all this a secret
from my dad.

152
00:11:24,929 --> 00:11:27,989
He would've had a fit
since Kit was ten years older than me...

153
00:11:28,066 --> 00:11:30,967
...and came from the wrong side
of the tracks, so-called.

154
00:11:31,035 --> 00:11:34,698
Our time with each other was limited
and each lived for the precious hours...

155
00:11:34,772 --> 00:11:39,505
...when he or she could be with the other,
away from all the cares of the world.

156
00:11:40,411 --> 00:11:42,276
My stomach's growling.

157
00:11:44,782 --> 00:11:47,250
There's an old Fudgesicle. You want it?

158
00:11:48,353 --> 00:11:49,342
No.

159
00:11:50,121 --> 00:11:51,952
Somebody else is gonna get it.

160
00:11:53,024 --> 00:11:54,252
I don't care.

161
00:11:57,528 --> 00:12:00,053
Kids eat that kind of stuff in Korea.

162
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:04,390
In the stench and slime of the feedlot...

163
00:12:04,469 --> 00:12:06,869
...he'd remember how I'd looked
the night before.

164
00:12:06,938 --> 00:12:08,838
How I ran my hand through his hair...

165
00:12:08,906 --> 00:12:11,875
...and traced the outline of his lips
with my fingertip.

166
00:12:12,143 --> 00:12:16,637
He wanted to die with me, and I dreamed
of being lost forever in his arms.

167
00:12:20,785 --> 00:12:22,946
The whole time,
the only thing I did wrong...

168
00:12:23,021 --> 00:12:25,581
...was throwing out my fish
when he got sick.

169
00:12:25,723 --> 00:12:29,682
Later I got a new one, but this incident
kept on bothering me and I turned to Kit.

170
00:12:30,194 --> 00:12:33,493
Well, he was sick, wasn't he?
Couldn't do much about that.

171
00:12:33,765 --> 00:12:34,925
I guess not.

172
00:12:41,506 --> 00:12:44,236
I didn't mind tellin' Kit
about stuff like this...

173
00:12:44,509 --> 00:12:47,069
...'cause strange things happened
in his life too.

174
00:12:47,145 --> 00:12:49,579
And some of the stuff he did was strange.

175
00:12:49,781 --> 00:12:52,909
For instance, he faked his signature
whenever he used it...

176
00:12:52,984 --> 00:12:56,886
...to keep other people from forgin'
important papers with his name.

177
00:13:00,992 --> 00:13:04,018
And as he lay in bed,
in the middle of the night...

178
00:13:04,162 --> 00:13:08,496
...he always heard a noise like somebody
was holdin' a seashell against his ear.

179
00:13:08,566 --> 00:13:12,195
And sometimes he'd see me comin'
toward him in beautiful white robes...

180
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:14,966
...and I'd put my cold hand on his forehead.

181
00:13:24,449 --> 00:13:26,314
Did it go the way it's supposed to?

182
00:13:28,619 --> 00:13:29,608
Yeah.

183
00:13:31,189 --> 00:13:32,656
Is that all there is to it?

184
00:13:33,391 --> 00:13:34,415
Yeah.

185
00:13:38,863 --> 00:13:40,922
Gosh, what was everybody talkin' about?

186
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,599
Don't ask me.

187
00:13:46,938 --> 00:13:48,769
Well, I'm glad it's over.

188
00:13:49,474 --> 00:13:52,204
For a while I was afraid I might die
before it happened.

189
00:13:52,443 --> 00:13:54,673
Had a wreck or some deal like that.

190
00:13:54,746 --> 00:13:57,374
See where that tree fell in the water?

191
00:13:58,015 --> 00:13:58,913
Yeah.

192
00:13:59,751 --> 00:14:02,276
River must've washed the roots away.

193
00:14:03,454 --> 00:14:05,854
You don't care
about anything I say, though.

194
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:09,522
-You know what I think?
-What?

195
00:14:09,594 --> 00:14:11,960
We should crunch our hands
with this stone.

196
00:14:12,263 --> 00:14:14,493
That way we'd never forget
what happened today.

197
00:14:14,565 --> 00:14:15,862
But it would hurt.

198
00:14:15,933 --> 00:14:18,231
Well, that's the point, stupid.

199
00:14:21,072 --> 00:14:22,869
Don't call me, "stupid."

200
00:14:24,675 --> 00:14:27,303
Okay, but I'm gonna keep it for a souvenir.

201
00:14:30,214 --> 00:14:32,307
Well, maybe one that's lighter.

202
00:14:44,061 --> 00:14:47,030
Kit made a solemn vow
that he would always stand beside me...

203
00:14:47,098 --> 00:14:49,157
...and let nothin' come between us.

204
00:14:49,233 --> 00:14:51,929
He wrote this out in writing,
put the paper in a box...

205
00:14:52,003 --> 00:14:56,235
...with some of our little tokens and things,
then sent it off in a balloon he'd found...

206
00:14:56,307 --> 00:14:58,434
...while on the garbage route.

207
00:14:59,043 --> 00:15:02,479
His heart was filled with longin'
as he watched it drift off.

208
00:15:02,547 --> 00:15:03,775
Something must've told him...

209
00:15:03,848 --> 00:15:06,612
...that we'd never live these days
of happiness again...

210
00:15:06,684 --> 00:15:08,379
...that they were gone forever.

211
00:15:19,897 --> 00:15:23,628
Then, sure enough, Dad found out
I'd been runnin' around behind his back.

212
00:15:23,701 --> 00:15:25,794
He was madder than I'd ever seen him.

213
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:29,328
As punishment for deceiving him,
he went and shot my dog.

214
00:15:57,468 --> 00:16:00,733
He made me take extra music lessons
every day after school...

215
00:16:00,938 --> 00:16:03,429
...and wait there till he came
to pick me up.

216
00:16:03,508 --> 00:16:06,375
He said that if the piano
didn't keep me off the streets...

217
00:16:06,444 --> 00:16:08,173
...maybe the clarinet would.

218
00:16:17,221 --> 00:16:18,518
Sure is pretty.

219
00:16:23,461 --> 00:16:25,156
What'd you come out here for?

220
00:16:29,734 --> 00:16:31,998
I wasn't aware there was
any law against it.

221
00:16:42,747 --> 00:16:43,839
You know, Holly...

222
00:16:45,616 --> 00:16:48,346
...well, she means an awful lot to me, sir.

223
00:16:51,122 --> 00:16:52,953
You know, before I met her...

224
00:16:53,824 --> 00:16:56,816
...nobody could ask me
how I was doin' with my girl.

225
00:16:57,261 --> 00:16:59,388
Matter of fact, I didn't really have one.

226
00:16:59,997 --> 00:17:01,430
Is that right?

227
00:17:11,742 --> 00:17:13,767
It okay me leanin' on your Willys here?

228
00:17:22,787 --> 00:17:24,914
I got a lot of respect for her, too, sir.

229
00:17:31,228 --> 00:17:33,560
It's about as good a one
as I know to tell you.

230
00:17:35,366 --> 00:17:36,594
It's not good enough.

231
00:17:38,569 --> 00:17:41,470
What do you think'll happen to her
if she stuck with you, Kit?

232
00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:42,563
A guy like you?

233
00:17:43,407 --> 00:17:44,772
She'd get along okay.

234
00:17:46,177 --> 00:17:47,872
And if she didn't, why...

235
00:17:48,846 --> 00:17:50,609
...she could just take off.

236
00:17:50,715 --> 00:17:52,774
Just take right on off, I wouldn't mind.

237
00:17:54,285 --> 00:17:56,879
I'd always tell people I deserved it.

238
00:18:07,765 --> 00:18:10,063
I don't want you hangin' around anymore.

239
00:18:10,434 --> 00:18:12,334
I don't want to see you again.

240
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:14,262
Understand?

241
00:18:27,451 --> 00:18:28,645
You're something.

242
00:18:34,992 --> 00:18:36,789
Takes all kinds, sir.

243
00:20:14,325 --> 00:20:15,314
Hi.

244
00:20:16,494 --> 00:20:18,189
What are you doing?

245
00:20:20,131 --> 00:20:21,496
I got a gun here, sir.

246
00:20:22,566 --> 00:20:24,830
Always a good idea to have one around.

247
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,131
What do you think you're doin'?

248
00:20:32,877 --> 00:20:34,208
Go on, get out of here.

249
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,807
I got it all planned.

250
00:20:38,949 --> 00:20:39,779
And...

251
00:20:40,985 --> 00:20:42,680
...Im takin' Holly off with me.

252
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:45,687
Okay, boy...

253
00:20:46,991 --> 00:20:49,516
...Im turnin' you over to the authorities.

254
00:20:50,728 --> 00:20:51,558
What for?

255
00:20:51,695 --> 00:20:52,821
Comin' on my property...

256
00:20:52,897 --> 00:20:54,159
...with a gun.

257
00:20:57,134 --> 00:20:58,897
No, you're not either.

258
00:20:58,969 --> 00:21:00,459
Yeah? Why not?

259
00:21:01,906 --> 00:21:03,305
'Cause I can't allow it.

260
00:21:06,443 --> 00:21:07,102
Hey!

261
00:21:07,978 --> 00:21:09,206
Hey, wait a minute!

262
00:21:12,716 --> 00:21:14,149
Suppose I shot you?

263
00:21:15,352 --> 00:21:16,614
How'd that be?

264
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:21,153
Want to hear what it sounds like?

265
00:21:33,003 --> 00:21:34,402
Kit! Kit!

266
00:21:34,471 --> 00:21:35,665
Where are you going?

267
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,270
Wait!

268
00:21:44,715 --> 00:21:45,443
Daddy?

269
00:21:47,618 --> 00:21:48,607
This is Holly.

270
00:21:51,655 --> 00:21:53,520
Are you gonna be okay?

271
00:22:26,023 --> 00:22:27,752
I came in the front.

272
00:22:29,293 --> 00:22:30,817
How bad off is he?

273
00:22:32,663 --> 00:22:34,358
I can look and see.

274
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,829
We better call the doctor.

275
00:22:41,138 --> 00:22:44,198
Listen, I'll say how it happened.
Part I saw.

276
00:22:46,076 --> 00:22:47,065
Well...

277
00:22:48,245 --> 00:22:50,076
...l don't think that'd work.

278
00:23:01,225 --> 00:23:03,056
He don't need a doctor.

279
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:09,928
Are you sure?

280
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,468
If you don't believe me, see for yourself.

281
00:24:05,389 --> 00:24:07,016
I found a toaster.

282
00:24:18,102 --> 00:24:19,501
Don't worry, honey, I'll--

283
00:24:49,199 --> 00:24:52,168
Listen, maybe we ought
to tell somebody about this.

284
00:24:54,571 --> 00:24:56,664
You said that once already.

285
00:24:57,474 --> 00:24:58,771
Too late now.

286
00:24:59,877 --> 00:25:00,866
Why?

287
00:25:02,346 --> 00:25:04,439
They're not going to listen to me.

288
00:25:04,748 --> 00:25:06,682
You either. You kidding?

289
00:25:12,523 --> 00:25:14,787
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?

290
00:25:16,894 --> 00:25:18,555
Wouldn't be funny.

291
00:25:24,568 --> 00:25:25,592
Listen...

292
00:25:26,904 --> 00:25:28,496
...Ill be back after a while.

293
00:25:34,711 --> 00:25:37,077
You want to call the police, that's fine.

294
00:25:37,181 --> 00:25:38,944
Just won't be so hot for me.

295
00:26:53,423 --> 00:26:56,187
My girl, Holly, and I have decided
to kill ourselves.

296
00:26:56,326 --> 00:26:58,021
Same way I did her dad.

297
00:26:58,996 --> 00:27:00,463
Big decision.

298
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,167
The reasons are obvious.

299
00:27:05,235 --> 00:27:07,999
Now, I don't have time
to go into 'em right now.

300
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,999
But, one thing though:

301
00:27:13,177 --> 00:27:15,543
He was provokin' me when I popped him.

302
00:27:16,113 --> 00:27:18,445
That's what it was like, pop!

303
00:27:20,117 --> 00:27:21,709
Now we're sorry.

304
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:27,018
I mean, nobody's comin' out
of this thing happy, especially not us.

305
00:27:30,093 --> 00:27:32,152
I can't deny we've had fun though.

306
00:27:32,729 --> 00:27:33,787
And...

307
00:27:34,731 --> 00:27:36,824
...that's more than I can say for some.

308
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:43,799
That's the end of the message.
I ran out of things to say.

309
00:27:46,777 --> 00:27:47,869
Thank you.

310
00:28:41,765 --> 00:28:44,598
My girl, Holly, and I have decided
to kill ourselves.

311
00:28:44,701 --> 00:28:46,601
Same way I did her dad.

312
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:50,938
Kit left the record playin' over and over
for the district attorney to find.

313
00:28:51,108 --> 00:28:52,973
He was gamblin' for time.

314
00:29:09,493 --> 00:29:13,156
"When Jesus walked into the garden

315
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:16,757
"And his suffering began

316
00:29:16,933 --> 00:29:20,460
"Everything mourned that was there

317
00:29:20,704 --> 00:29:25,073
"Even the foliage and the green grass:

318
00:29:34,818 --> 00:29:38,379
"Mary held a small bell, ringing

319
00:29:38,488 --> 00:29:41,980
"Oh my, oh my darling child

320
00:29:42,192 --> 00:29:45,719
"Oh how, oh how my heart is breaking

321
00:29:45,796 --> 00:29:49,994
"My son, my son, I am losing you

322
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:04,176
"Mary went to the Cross

323
00:30:04,247 --> 00:30:07,842
"She saw her dear child hanging before her

324
00:30:07,984 --> 00:30:11,579
"There he was hanging on a cross

325
00:30:11,755 --> 00:30:13,347
"Mary's heart was in pain"

326
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:19,051
Kit made me get my books from school
so I wouldn't fall behind.

327
00:30:19,363 --> 00:30:23,163
We'd be startin' a new life, he said,
and we'd have to change our names.

328
00:30:23,233 --> 00:30:26,168
His name would be James,
mine would be Priscilla.

329
00:30:26,269 --> 00:30:28,931
We'd hide out like spies
somewhere in the North...

330
00:30:29,005 --> 00:30:31,667
...where people didn't ask
a lot of questions.

331
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:37,311
I could've snuck out the back
or hid in the boiler room I suppose.

332
00:30:37,414 --> 00:30:41,612
But I sensed that my destiny now lay
with Kit, for better or for worse.

333
00:30:41,885 --> 00:30:45,616
And that it was better to spend a week
with one who loved me for what I was...

334
00:30:45,689 --> 00:30:47,520
...than years of loneliness.

335
00:30:50,694 --> 00:30:51,752
How're you doing?

336
00:30:54,164 --> 00:30:55,153
I'm fine.

337
00:30:55,899 --> 00:30:57,093
Kind of tired.

338
00:31:01,037 --> 00:31:02,334
Yeah, me too.

339
00:31:13,483 --> 00:31:17,419
We hid out in the wilderness
down by a river in a grove of cottonwoods.

340
00:31:17,788 --> 00:31:20,757
It bein' the flood season,
we built our house in the trees...

341
00:31:20,824 --> 00:31:24,817
...with tamarisk walls and willows laid
side by side to make a floor.

342
00:31:25,162 --> 00:31:28,893
There wasn't a plant in the forest
that didn't come in handy.

343
00:31:49,619 --> 00:31:52,588
We planned a huge network of tunnels
under the forest floor.

344
00:31:52,656 --> 00:31:54,590
Our first order of business every morning...

345
00:31:54,658 --> 00:31:57,252
...was to decide on our new password
for the day.

346
00:31:57,794 --> 00:32:01,389
Now and then we'd sneak out at night
and steal a chicken or some corn...

347
00:32:01,465 --> 00:32:03,558
...or some melons from a melon patch.

348
00:32:05,202 --> 00:32:08,763
Mostly, though, we just lay on our backs
and stared at the clouds.

349
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:11,569
And sometimes it was like bein'
in a big marble hall...

350
00:32:11,641 --> 00:32:15,270
...the way we talked in low voices
and heard the tiniest sound.

351
00:32:29,493 --> 00:32:32,690
They hadn't found but one set of bones
in the ashes of the house...

352
00:32:32,762 --> 00:32:34,855
...so we knew they'd be looking for us.

353
00:32:35,098 --> 00:32:37,089
Kit made sure we'd be prepared.

354
00:32:42,506 --> 00:32:44,804
He gave me lectures on how a gun works.

355
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:47,673
How to take it apart
and put it back together again...

356
00:32:47,911 --> 00:32:50,277
...in case I had to carry on without him.

357
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:54,009
He said that if the Devil came at me,
I could shoot him with a gun.

358
00:32:58,555 --> 00:33:02,184
One day, I carried 30 pounds of wood
a distance of five miles.

359
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:07,956
Another day, while hiding in the forest,
I covered my eyes with makeup...

360
00:33:08,098 --> 00:33:09,998
...to see how they'd come out.

361
00:33:26,049 --> 00:33:27,573
"Love

362
00:33:29,019 --> 00:33:30,953
"Love is strange

363
00:33:32,923 --> 00:33:35,517
"Lot of people

364
00:33:36,993 --> 00:33:38,460
"Take it for a game"

365
00:33:48,972 --> 00:33:51,440
We had our bad moments like any couple.

366
00:33:52,008 --> 00:33:54,841
Kit accused me of only bein' along
for the ride.

367
00:33:55,145 --> 00:33:59,479
While, at times, I wished he'd fall
in the river and drown, so I could watch.

368
00:34:01,718 --> 00:34:03,379
Take a break, Red.

369
00:34:06,556 --> 00:34:08,148
Life of Riley.

370
00:34:08,558 --> 00:34:11,959
Mostly, though, we got along fine
and stayed in love.

371
00:34:14,197 --> 00:34:16,597
One of the chickens died last night.

372
00:34:33,183 --> 00:34:35,048
I almost stepped on him.

373
00:34:35,885 --> 00:34:37,682
"The Kon-Tiki's motion was different...

374
00:34:37,754 --> 00:34:40,222
"...from what it usually was
in such conditions.

375
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:43,316
"We had become sensitive to changes
in the rhythm of the logs.

376
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:46,925
"I thought of the suction from the coast,
which was drawing near...

377
00:34:46,997 --> 00:34:49,488
"...and was continually on the deck
and up the mast."

378
00:34:49,566 --> 00:34:50,658
He was nervous.

379
00:34:52,102 --> 00:34:54,866
"Time passed. At dawn, just before 6:00...

380
00:34:55,271 --> 00:34:57,899
"...Terstein came hurrying down
from the masthead.

381
00:34:57,974 --> 00:35:01,137
"He could see a whole line of small,
palm-clad islands far ahead."

382
00:35:19,095 --> 00:35:20,722
I grew to love the forest.

383
00:35:21,131 --> 00:35:24,862
The cooin' of the doves and the hum
of the dragonflies in the air...

384
00:35:24,934 --> 00:35:28,131
...made it always seem lonesome
and like everybody's dead and gone.

385
00:35:29,305 --> 00:35:32,900
When the leaves rustled overhead
it was like the spirits were whispering...

386
00:35:32,976 --> 00:35:35,467
...about all the little things
that bothered them.

387
00:35:48,158 --> 00:35:52,026
One day, while taking a look
at some vistas in Dad's stereopticon...

388
00:35:52,262 --> 00:35:55,561
...it hit me that I was just this little girl,
born in Texas...

389
00:35:55,832 --> 00:36:00,235
...whose father was a sign painter,
who had only just so man-years to live.

390
00:36:01,438 --> 00:36:04,100
Sent a chill down my spine and I thought:

391
00:36:05,008 --> 00:36:07,203
Where would I be this very moment...

392
00:36:07,944 --> 00:36:09,809
...if Kit had never met me?

393
00:36:11,014 --> 00:36:12,641
Or killed anybody?

394
00:36:14,184 --> 00:36:15,708
This very moment.

395
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:19,181
If my mom had never met my dad.

396
00:36:21,725 --> 00:36:23,920
If she'd never died.

397
00:36:25,328 --> 00:36:28,024
And what's the man I'll marry
gonna look like?

398
00:36:29,332 --> 00:36:31,766
What's he doin' right this minute?

399
00:36:32,068 --> 00:36:35,265
Is he thinkin' about me now,
by some coincidence...

400
00:36:35,505 --> 00:36:37,871
...even though he doesn't know me?

401
00:36:38,875 --> 00:36:40,843
Does it show on his face?

402
00:36:42,712 --> 00:36:45,237
For days afterward I lived in dread.

403
00:36:45,782 --> 00:36:50,151
Sometimes I wished I could fall asleep
and be taken off to some magical land...

404
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,654
...but this never happened.

405
00:37:28,525 --> 00:37:30,254
"I know the stars

406
00:37:31,294 --> 00:37:32,886
"And I know the trees

407
00:37:34,664 --> 00:37:36,188
"I know the flowers

408
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,427
"And I set the breeze"

409
00:37:46,442 --> 00:37:49,275
"The door is closed,
We can't go in

410
00:37:49,712 --> 00:37:52,237
"The door is closed,
We can't go in

411
00:37:52,448 --> 00:37:55,212
"Inside lives a rich one,
We don't like him, no

412
00:37:55,451 --> 00:37:58,284
"The door is closed,
We can't go in

413
00:37:58,421 --> 00:38:01,288
"The door is closed,
We can't go in

414
00:38:01,424 --> 00:38:04,655
"Inside lives a rich one,
We don't like him, no!"

415
00:38:13,937 --> 00:38:14,699
What?

416
00:38:20,944 --> 00:38:22,411
Get out of here! Run!

417
00:38:23,513 --> 00:38:25,140
Somebody's coming!

418
00:38:27,917 --> 00:38:28,975
Hide!

419
00:40:10,019 --> 00:40:11,179
Holly!

420
00:40:20,229 --> 00:40:21,890
Get in the car, Red.

421
00:40:24,634 --> 00:40:26,226
We don't need this.

422
00:40:31,574 --> 00:40:34,236
Kit felt bad about shootin' those men
in the back.

423
00:40:34,344 --> 00:40:37,006
But he said they came in
and would have played it...

424
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,207
...as down and dirty as they could.

425
00:40:39,282 --> 00:40:41,750
And besides, he'd overheard 'em
whisperin' about...

426
00:40:41,818 --> 00:40:44,685
...how they were only interested
in the reward money.

427
00:40:44,787 --> 00:40:46,778
With lawmen it would've been different.

428
00:40:46,856 --> 00:40:50,451
They were out there to get a job done
and they deserved a fair chance.

429
00:40:50,626 --> 00:40:52,457
But not a bounty hunter.

430
00:41:27,997 --> 00:41:31,956
We went to hide out with a friend of Kit's
from the days of the garbage route.

431
00:41:54,223 --> 00:41:55,815
How you doing, Cato?

432
00:41:56,426 --> 00:41:57,484
Not bad.

433
00:42:04,667 --> 00:42:06,100
Take that son of a bitch.

434
00:42:19,715 --> 00:42:20,909
What you been doing?

435
00:42:21,818 --> 00:42:23,718
Runnin' this place for a fella in town.

436
00:42:23,786 --> 00:42:25,651
Nothin' much to speak of.

437
00:42:28,591 --> 00:42:31,685
Well, I don't notice us hustlin' trash, either.

438
00:42:35,498 --> 00:42:37,398
Where'd you get them antlers?

439
00:42:37,934 --> 00:42:39,925
They come with the house.

440
00:42:44,874 --> 00:42:46,068
Well, Cato...

441
00:42:47,376 --> 00:42:49,071
...l want you to meet my girl...

442
00:42:50,279 --> 00:42:51,610
...Holly Sargis.

443
00:42:53,716 --> 00:42:54,683
Hi.

444
00:42:55,318 --> 00:42:58,685
Did you hear about the guy at the nuthouse
that walked around naked...

445
00:42:58,754 --> 00:43:00,187
...except for hat and gloves?

446
00:43:00,256 --> 00:43:04,056
And this nurse come up to him and said,
"Hey, you can't walk around that way."

447
00:43:04,227 --> 00:43:08,323
And the guy says, "Well, it's okay.
Nobody comes around here anyway."

448
00:43:08,531 --> 00:43:10,089
And the nurse says:

449
00:43:10,566 --> 00:43:13,228
"Well what do you have on
the hat and gloves for?"

450
00:43:13,302 --> 00:43:15,429
And the guy says, "Well, you never know."

451
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:25,638
Isn't that funny?

452
00:43:28,718 --> 00:43:29,810
Yeah, I guess.

453
00:43:30,353 --> 00:43:32,184
She plays the clarinet, too.

454
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:36,650
-Don't you get bored around here?
-Well...

455
00:43:36,726 --> 00:43:37,852
...sometimes.

456
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:42,688
The other day though...

457
00:43:42,999 --> 00:43:45,433
...an old boy plowin' the field over there...

458
00:43:45,868 --> 00:43:47,267
...found some old coins.

459
00:43:48,871 --> 00:43:50,771
Some old Spanish coins.

460
00:43:51,807 --> 00:43:53,604
That's what he told you?

461
00:43:53,676 --> 00:43:54,700
Nope, no.

462
00:43:55,511 --> 00:43:56,876
He showed me one.

463
00:43:57,513 --> 00:43:59,071
What'd they look like?

464
00:43:59,248 --> 00:44:00,579
Kind of round, like so.

465
00:44:01,317 --> 00:44:02,306
Gold.

466
00:44:02,385 --> 00:44:03,147
Where at?

467
00:44:03,352 --> 00:44:05,377
Right over in that field over there.

468
00:44:08,324 --> 00:44:09,985
I'll show you if you want.

469
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,325
Let me finish my supper.

470
00:44:19,969 --> 00:44:22,199
Well, we're thinkin' of goin' down to Texas.

471
00:44:22,271 --> 00:44:25,104
Holly wants to visit
some of her people down there.

472
00:44:25,174 --> 00:44:27,233
But after that, I don't know.

473
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:29,510
They say Mexico's nice.

474
00:44:31,981 --> 00:44:34,074
Kit, maybe I better get a shovel.

475
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:35,314
Okay.

476
00:44:35,384 --> 00:44:36,373
I'll catch up with you.

477
00:44:36,452 --> 00:44:37,316
Okay.

478
00:44:40,323 --> 00:44:43,053
I found a lid.
It was layin' on the ground over there.

479
00:44:43,125 --> 00:44:45,150
Put that down, it's dirty.

480
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:58,770
You missed!

481
00:44:58,841 --> 00:45:00,399
You're a piss-ass!

482
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:06,543
Hey, you're throwin' big ones!

483
00:45:11,053 --> 00:45:11,781
Cato!

484
00:45:12,989 --> 00:45:14,388
The shovel's in the truck.

485
00:45:58,234 --> 00:46:00,429
Kit never let on why he shot Cato.

486
00:46:00,836 --> 00:46:03,805
He said that just talkin' about it
could bring us bad luck...

487
00:46:03,873 --> 00:46:06,774
...and that right now we needed
all the luck we could get.

488
00:46:10,513 --> 00:46:12,640
You never told me about her.

489
00:46:35,137 --> 00:46:36,934
Look at all this junk.

490
00:46:39,141 --> 00:46:40,403
How's he doing?

491
00:46:45,047 --> 00:46:46,981
I got him in the stomach.

492
00:46:50,886 --> 00:46:52,080
Is he upset?

493
00:46:53,356 --> 00:46:55,517
He didn't say anything to me about it.

494
00:47:13,442 --> 00:47:14,875
Bunch of junk.

495
00:47:25,621 --> 00:47:27,248
He stole that cage.

496
00:47:28,057 --> 00:47:29,581
I saw him do it.

497
00:47:35,631 --> 00:47:38,191
What'cha lookin' in there for?
Can't afford any of that.

498
00:47:38,267 --> 00:47:39,325
I'm just looking.

499
00:47:40,669 --> 00:47:43,570
Why don't you go in there
and keep him company for a while?

500
00:47:50,379 --> 00:47:51,368
Hi.

501
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:56,008
Is that your spider in there?

502
00:47:56,986 --> 00:47:58,317
In that bottle?

503
00:47:59,088 --> 00:48:00,077
Yeah.

504
00:48:02,158 --> 00:48:03,785
What did you feed him?

505
00:48:05,327 --> 00:48:06,589
Flies...

506
00:48:08,664 --> 00:48:11,155
...grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.

507
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,931
Does he bite?

508
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:15,903
He never bit me.

509
00:48:38,761 --> 00:48:39,750
Hi.

510
00:48:41,497 --> 00:48:42,464
Hi.

511
00:48:42,531 --> 00:48:43,828
Where's Cato?

512
00:48:45,167 --> 00:48:46,498
Well, he's gone.

513
00:48:46,869 --> 00:48:47,927
-Gone?
-Yeah.

514
00:48:48,003 --> 00:48:48,970
Where?

515
00:48:49,705 --> 00:48:50,899
He said not to tell.

516
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:52,164
Yeah?

517
00:48:53,909 --> 00:48:56,844
He said for you to give us a lift into town.

518
00:48:58,347 --> 00:49:00,713
You're the ones with the Studebaker,
aren't you?

519
00:49:01,684 --> 00:49:03,481
I need to pick up something in the house.

520
00:49:03,552 --> 00:49:05,144
I can't allow that.

521
00:49:06,622 --> 00:49:07,611
What?

522
00:49:07,857 --> 00:49:09,722
If you go in there, I'll have to kill you.

523
00:49:09,792 --> 00:49:10,884
What's goin' on?

524
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,518
Can't afford to take chances.

525
00:49:12,928 --> 00:49:15,089
Come out of there, young lady.

526
00:49:17,466 --> 00:49:20,993
Let's us go out in this field here.
Come on. Skip that.

527
00:49:22,071 --> 00:49:24,005
I'm gonna have to keep my eye
on you though.

528
00:49:24,073 --> 00:49:24,937
Okay.

529
00:49:25,007 --> 00:49:26,031
You don't mind?

530
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:31,068
Hi.

531
00:49:33,449 --> 00:49:35,883
What's gonna happen to Jack and me?

532
00:49:36,085 --> 00:49:37,484
Have to ask Kit.

533
00:49:37,853 --> 00:49:39,548
He says, "frog," I jump.

534
00:49:40,456 --> 00:49:41,445
Okay.

535
00:49:42,958 --> 00:49:44,687
What's your friend's name?

536
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:45,749
Jack.

537
00:49:47,763 --> 00:49:48,957
You love him?

538
00:49:49,298 --> 00:49:50,560
I don't know.

539
00:49:52,368 --> 00:49:55,098
I gotta stick by Kit. He feels trapped.

540
00:49:56,372 --> 00:49:57,964
Yeah, I can imagine.

541
00:49:58,207 --> 00:50:00,835
Well, I've felt that way, hadn't you?

542
00:50:07,349 --> 00:50:09,840
Okay, come on you two, down in the cellar.

543
00:50:11,554 --> 00:50:12,543
Go on.

544
00:50:16,091 --> 00:50:17,080
Hey.

545
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,558
-Promise to stay down there for an hour?
-Yeah.

546
00:50:22,031 --> 00:50:23,623
You expect me to believe that?

547
00:50:24,099 --> 00:50:25,088
Yeah.

548
00:50:28,037 --> 00:50:29,436
I'm gonna shut the door.

549
00:50:37,913 --> 00:50:39,904
-Think I got 'em?
-I don't know.

550
00:50:39,982 --> 00:50:42,212
Well, I'm not goin' down there and look.

551
00:51:03,906 --> 00:51:06,170
Suddenly I was thrown
into a state of shock.

552
00:51:06,609 --> 00:51:09,373
Kit was the most trigger-happy person
I'd ever met.

553
00:51:09,445 --> 00:51:13,176
He claimed that as long as you're playin'
for keeps, and the law is comin at you...

554
00:51:13,248 --> 00:51:15,944
...it's considered okay
to shoot all witnesses.

555
00:51:16,185 --> 00:51:19,677
You had to take the consequences,
though, and not whine about it later.

556
00:51:27,129 --> 00:51:29,620
He never seemed like
a violent person before...

557
00:51:29,698 --> 00:51:32,792
...except for once, when he said
he'd like to rub out a few guys...

558
00:51:32,868 --> 00:51:34,995
...whose names he didn't care to mention.

559
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:37,129
It all goes to show
how you can know a person...

560
00:51:37,206 --> 00:51:39,504
...and not really know him
at the same time.

561
00:51:45,514 --> 00:51:46,708
We're in for it now.

562
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:49,181
If they catch us.

563
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:00,155
What'd you put him in there for?

564
00:52:02,331 --> 00:52:04,231
Just to keep him out of the sun.

565
00:52:37,933 --> 00:52:41,767
At this moment, I didn't feel shame or fear,
but just kind of blah...

566
00:52:42,337 --> 00:52:46,239
...like when you're sittin' there
and all the water's run out of the bathtub.

567
00:52:46,642 --> 00:52:47,700
You tired?

568
00:52:47,876 --> 00:52:48,865
Yeah.

569
00:52:49,478 --> 00:52:51,173
Yeah, you look tired.

570
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:57,350
Listen, honey, when all this is over...

571
00:52:57,419 --> 00:52:59,683
...Im gonna sit down
and buy you a thick steak.

572
00:52:59,755 --> 00:53:01,120
I don't want a steak.

573
00:53:02,825 --> 00:53:05,123
Yeah, well, we'll see about that.

574
00:53:06,261 --> 00:53:07,285
Hey, look.

575
00:53:07,529 --> 00:53:09,759
They're probably gonna blame that
on me too.

576
00:53:10,432 --> 00:53:11,524
Bastards.

577
00:53:14,103 --> 00:53:18,938
The whole country was out lookin' for us,
for who knew where Kit would strike next?

578
00:53:19,274 --> 00:53:20,866
Sidewalks cleared out.

579
00:53:20,976 --> 00:53:23,740
Stores closed their doors
and drew their blinds.

580
00:53:23,879 --> 00:53:28,213
Posses and vigilante committees
were set up from Texas to South Dakota.

581
00:53:28,517 --> 00:53:31,975
Children rode back and forth to school
under heavy guard.

582
00:53:32,221 --> 00:53:34,917
A famous detective was brought in
from Boston.

583
00:53:35,224 --> 00:53:36,919
He could find no clues.

584
00:53:40,629 --> 00:53:43,564
People left their lights on
when they went to sleep.

585
00:53:43,665 --> 00:53:48,398
My clarinet teacher said I probably
wasn't responsible, but others said I was.

586
00:53:48,937 --> 00:53:52,338
Then, on Thursday,
the governor of Oklahoma sent out...

587
00:53:52,407 --> 00:53:56,571
...the National Guard to stand watch
at the Federal Reserve Bank in Tulsa...

588
00:53:56,745 --> 00:53:59,475
...when word got out
that Kit meant to rob it.

589
00:54:00,048 --> 00:54:02,346
It was like the Russians had invaded.

590
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:21,760
We needed supplies,
so we went to a rich man's house.

591
00:54:22,137 --> 00:54:25,834
Kit figured it'd be safer and quicker
than shoppin' in the downtown.

592
00:54:26,708 --> 00:54:28,141
A maid came to the door.

593
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:31,777
Hi. I'm here to check your meter.
My tools are in here.

594
00:54:33,982 --> 00:54:35,847
This is Holly. She's from Texas.

595
00:54:37,953 --> 00:54:41,218
Later we found out she was deaf
and we hadn't even known it.

596
00:54:42,357 --> 00:54:43,585
Excuse me.

597
00:54:46,361 --> 00:54:47,350
Hi.

598
00:54:47,496 --> 00:54:48,485
Yes?

599
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:50,196
This is your place?

600
00:54:50,432 --> 00:54:51,421
Yes.

601
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,092
Sorry to barge in on you.

602
00:54:53,168 --> 00:54:55,398
Anyone else here besides you two?

603
00:54:56,605 --> 00:54:57,230
No.

604
00:55:00,909 --> 00:55:02,035
Good deal.

605
00:55:08,417 --> 00:55:09,884
We're on the run.

606
00:55:10,419 --> 00:55:11,408
And....

607
00:55:12,487 --> 00:55:16,048
We'd like to hang out here for a while,
couple hours maybe. How'd that be?

608
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:19,454
Stay as long as you like.

609
00:55:40,282 --> 00:55:43,274
Next time I ring that means
it's time to clear out.

610
00:56:29,364 --> 00:56:33,164
I left Kit in the parlor and went for a stroll
outside the house.

611
00:56:33,669 --> 00:56:38,368
The day was quiet and serene but
I didn't notice, for I was deep in thought...

612
00:56:38,674 --> 00:56:41,643
...and not even thinking
about how to slip off.

613
00:56:52,788 --> 00:56:56,588
The world was like a faraway planet
to which I could never return.

614
00:56:56,792 --> 00:56:59,022
I thought what a fine place it was...

615
00:56:59,194 --> 00:57:02,254
...full of things that people can look into
and enjoy.

616
00:57:04,566 --> 00:57:06,796
Listen to your parents and teachers.

617
00:57:06,902 --> 00:57:10,099
They got a line on most things,
so don't treat 'em like enemies.

618
00:57:10,172 --> 00:57:13,437
There's always an outside chance
you could learn something.

619
00:57:19,481 --> 00:57:21,176
Try to keep an open mind.

620
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:24,410
Try to understand the viewpoints of others.

621
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:27,281
Consider the minority opinion...

622
00:57:28,156 --> 00:57:32,058
...but try to get along with the majority
of opinion once it's accepted.

623
00:57:37,766 --> 00:57:41,133
Of course, Holly and I have had fun
even if it has been rushed.

624
00:57:41,837 --> 00:57:42,826
And...

625
00:57:44,172 --> 00:57:45,764
...so far, we're doin' fine.

626
00:57:46,174 --> 00:57:47,607
Hadn't got caught.

627
00:57:48,377 --> 00:57:49,810
Excuse the grammar.

628
00:57:58,620 --> 00:57:59,609
Hi.

629
00:58:00,889 --> 00:58:03,119
Kit's downstairs playin'
with the dictaphone.

630
00:58:04,593 --> 00:58:08,324
Sometimes he acts like
there's somethin' wrong with his bean.

631
00:58:13,468 --> 00:58:16,062
Hope nothin' ever goes wrong with mine.

632
00:58:16,872 --> 00:58:18,897
You think he's crazy?

633
00:58:19,374 --> 00:58:21,467
I don't know, he's kind of odd.

634
00:58:30,819 --> 00:58:33,549
They claim I've got him wrapped
around my little finger.

635
00:58:33,822 --> 00:58:35,790
But I never told him to shoot anybody.

636
00:58:40,095 --> 00:58:42,529
-Gosh, I like your house.
-Thank you.

637
00:59:03,518 --> 00:59:04,507
Hi.

638
00:59:05,754 --> 00:59:07,881
Hi, Mr. Scarborough here?

639
00:59:08,657 --> 00:59:12,650
Yeah. The thing about him,
he's down with the flu. He's sick.

640
00:59:13,862 --> 00:59:14,624
Really?

641
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:18,227
Yeah. I'd invite you inside
except it's contagious.

642
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:20,527
Don't want to start an epidemic.

643
00:59:20,602 --> 00:59:21,830
No, of course not.

644
00:59:22,270 --> 00:59:24,067
It's only, he called last night...

645
00:59:24,139 --> 00:59:25,970
...and asked if I'd come by.

646
00:59:26,908 --> 00:59:28,569
He didn't have it last night.

647
00:59:37,185 --> 00:59:38,083
What's that?

648
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:40,986
Well, I'd like to leave a message...

649
00:59:41,056 --> 00:59:42,717
...if that's okay.

650
00:59:43,558 --> 00:59:44,286
Sure.

651
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:53,167
You have to excuse me now.

652
00:59:53,268 --> 00:59:54,929
I have to go back inside.

653
00:59:55,770 --> 00:59:56,759
'Bye.

654
01:00:11,219 --> 01:00:13,346
Hey, Tex, we're out of here!

655
01:00:28,403 --> 01:00:30,371
Hi! What'cha doing?

656
01:00:30,739 --> 01:00:31,967
Just thinking.

657
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,401
Good a way to kill time as any.

658
01:00:34,809 --> 01:00:35,639
She okay?

659
01:00:36,912 --> 01:00:37,674
Yes.

660
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,269
Good.

661
01:00:39,681 --> 01:00:41,842
We're gonna take the Cadillac for a while.

662
01:00:41,917 --> 01:00:44,010
-How'd that be?
-Fine.

663
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:47,688
Don't worry, I won't let her drive.

664
01:00:49,658 --> 01:00:52,650
Here's a list of everything I borrowed.
Car's on there, too.

665
01:00:52,727 --> 01:00:54,854
Okay, ma'am, let's go, out that way.

666
01:00:56,498 --> 01:00:57,556
Go on.

667
01:01:00,769 --> 01:01:01,997
You're my friend, aren't you?

668
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:03,799
Okay, no monkey business now.

669
01:01:13,715 --> 01:01:14,807
Groceries.

670
01:01:18,053 --> 01:01:21,716
That guy could sell that list I gave him
as a sample of my handwriting.

671
01:01:29,965 --> 01:01:31,728
Why're you always walkin' ahead of me?

672
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:34,598
Well, why are you always walkin'
behind me?

673
01:01:36,638 --> 01:01:37,627
Don't.

674
01:01:38,273 --> 01:01:40,400
-Anybody ever done that to you before?
-No.

675
01:01:40,475 --> 01:01:41,499
Positive?

676
01:01:42,210 --> 01:01:43,199
Yes.

677
01:01:45,814 --> 01:01:48,749
Guess there's no way
I'll ever know for sure.

678
01:01:50,986 --> 01:01:54,217
That guy must pay through the nose
to keep this place up.

679
01:01:54,923 --> 01:01:57,517
Lawn, gas and electric.

680
01:01:58,560 --> 01:01:59,584
Bagworms.

681
01:02:00,095 --> 01:02:02,063
Plus the upkeep on the cars.

682
01:02:03,331 --> 01:02:07,427
You get a little money in your pocket
and you think all your problems are solved.

683
01:02:07,502 --> 01:02:09,902
Well, let me tell you. They're not.

684
01:02:33,128 --> 01:02:34,925
I'd like to get out of here.

685
01:02:36,464 --> 01:02:38,227
Soon as I start the car.

686
01:02:40,735 --> 01:02:42,100
And fix my hat.

687
01:02:56,017 --> 01:02:58,281
Fearin' there'd be roadblocks
on the highways...

688
01:02:58,353 --> 01:03:01,379
...we took off across that region
known as the Great Plains.

689
01:03:01,856 --> 01:03:04,552
Kit told me to enjoy the scenery and I did.

690
01:03:06,261 --> 01:03:10,595
"Rumor: Pat Boone is seriously
considering giving up his career...

691
01:03:10,699 --> 01:03:14,396
"...so he can return to school full-time
and complete his education.

692
01:03:14,969 --> 01:03:19,235
"Fact: Pat has told intimates
that so long as things are going well...

693
01:03:19,307 --> 01:03:23,334
"...for his career, it's the education
that will have to take a back seat."

694
01:03:23,845 --> 01:03:25,107
I don't blame him.

695
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:28,741
"Rumor: Frank Sinatra
and Rita Hayworth are in love.

696
01:03:29,684 --> 01:03:32,050
"Fact: True. But not with each other."

697
01:03:38,093 --> 01:03:38,923
Yeah.

698
01:03:42,497 --> 01:03:46,331
Through the desert and mesa,
across endless miles of open range...

699
01:03:46,601 --> 01:03:48,262
...we made our headlong way...

700
01:03:48,470 --> 01:03:52,497
...steering by the telephone lines
toward the mountains of Montana.

701
01:03:56,745 --> 01:04:00,146
Kit'd sometimes ram a cow
to save on ammo and we'd cook it.

702
01:04:01,683 --> 01:04:03,981
Once we had to eat a bunch of salt grass.

703
01:04:04,052 --> 01:04:05,576
It tasted like cabbage.

704
01:04:12,227 --> 01:04:15,253
For gas we used the leakage
from the valves of the pipelines...

705
01:04:15,330 --> 01:04:16,922
...we found along the way.

706
01:04:17,198 --> 01:04:20,065
"Drip gas" is what it's called
in that part of the country.

707
01:04:21,269 --> 01:04:23,703
Little by little, we approached the border.

708
01:04:24,072 --> 01:04:27,473
Kit was glad to leave South Dakota behind
and cursed its name.

709
01:04:28,143 --> 01:04:31,169
He said that if Communists ever dropped
the atomic bomb...

710
01:04:31,246 --> 01:04:34,773
...he wished they'd put it right
in the middle of Rapid City.

711
01:04:37,585 --> 01:04:39,485
That's Montana over there.

712
01:04:41,189 --> 01:04:42,952
I never been to Montana.

713
01:04:48,696 --> 01:04:51,494
Acquaintance of mine's been there,
but I hadn't.

714
01:04:53,168 --> 01:04:54,897
Never had any reason to.

715
01:04:58,473 --> 01:05:00,338
State bird's the meadowlark.

716
01:05:38,613 --> 01:05:41,741
We lived in utter loneliness,
neither here nor there.

717
01:05:42,350 --> 01:05:45,911
Kit said that "solitude" was a better word,
'cause it meant more exactly...

718
01:05:45,987 --> 01:05:47,614
...what I wanted to say.

719
01:05:47,856 --> 01:05:52,020
Whatever the expression, I told him
we couldn't go on livin' this way.

720
01:05:53,862 --> 01:05:54,794
Why not?

721
01:05:55,697 --> 01:05:58,393
I mean, I'm havin' fun.
At least I'm not bitchin'.

722
01:05:59,501 --> 01:06:02,026
Well, I feel kind of like an animal
livin' out here.

723
01:06:02,103 --> 01:06:03,968
There's no place to bathe and...

724
01:06:04,806 --> 01:06:07,331
...not any place to get anything
good to eat.

725
01:06:10,245 --> 01:06:13,408
Well, I'll catch you a big trout
soon as we get to the mountains.

726
01:06:23,124 --> 01:06:24,819
Everybody loves trout.

727
01:06:26,194 --> 01:06:27,422
I'm serious.

728
01:06:40,975 --> 01:06:45,275
In the distance, I saw a train
makin' its way silently across the plain...

729
01:06:45,647 --> 01:06:48,946
...like the caravan
in The Adventures of Marco Polo.

730
01:06:49,284 --> 01:06:51,844
It was our first taste of civilization
in weeks...

731
01:06:52,153 --> 01:06:54,713
...and I asked Kit
if we could have a closer look.

732
01:07:03,798 --> 01:07:07,666
Before we left, he shot a football
that he considered excess baggage.

733
01:07:08,369 --> 01:07:11,532
Afterwards, he took and buried
some of our things in a bucket.

734
01:07:11,639 --> 01:07:14,301
He said that nobody else would know
where we put 'em...

735
01:07:14,375 --> 01:07:17,936
...and we'd come back someday,
maybe, and they'd still be sittin' here...

736
01:07:18,012 --> 01:07:20,606
...just the same, but we'd be different.

737
01:07:20,715 --> 01:07:22,842
And if we never got back, well...

738
01:07:23,151 --> 01:07:27,053
...somebody might dig 'em up 1,000 years
from now, and wouldn't they wonder.

739
01:08:07,495 --> 01:08:09,326
Maybe we should've tried to hop it.

740
01:08:11,099 --> 01:08:12,828
It was goin' too fast.

741
01:08:13,568 --> 01:08:16,765
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks,
slowed it down some.

742
01:08:17,605 --> 01:08:19,470
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.

743
01:08:19,741 --> 01:08:21,834
Well, maybe we ought to be stuck here.

744
01:08:22,410 --> 01:08:23,809
I'm not saying I know.

745
01:08:28,016 --> 01:08:29,142
You're crazy.

746
01:08:40,895 --> 01:08:43,022
Kit took the bottle and spun it around...

747
01:08:43,097 --> 01:08:45,622
...leaving to fate which direction
we should take.

748
01:08:51,172 --> 01:08:53,003
Maybe the slope is throwin' it off some.

749
01:08:53,074 --> 01:08:55,008
We ought to find a more flat place.

750
01:08:55,076 --> 01:08:56,634
How about over here?

751
01:09:01,516 --> 01:09:03,381
Forget it, it doesn't matter.

752
01:09:03,551 --> 01:09:05,542
If I'm worth a damn,
I'll pick the right direction.

753
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:08,088
If I'm not, well, I don't care.
See what I mean?

754
01:09:08,489 --> 01:09:09,285
No.

755
01:09:09,357 --> 01:09:11,985
Well, I shouldn't expect miracles, should l?

756
01:09:23,204 --> 01:09:25,604
We'll keep on headin' for that mountain.

757
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:29,066
Just remember,
I said it wasn't such a hot idea.

758
01:09:31,746 --> 01:09:35,944
We took off at sunset, on a line
toward the mountains of Saskatchewan...

759
01:09:36,484 --> 01:09:39,647
...for Kit, a magical land
beyond the reach of the law.

760
01:09:40,688 --> 01:09:44,385
He needed me now, more than ever,
but something had come between us.

761
01:09:44,759 --> 01:09:47,125
I stopped even payin' attention to him.

762
01:09:47,395 --> 01:09:51,661
Instead I sat in the car and read a map
and spelled out entire sentences...

763
01:09:51,733 --> 01:09:55,225
...with my tongue on the roof of my mouth
where nobody could read 'em.

764
01:09:59,941 --> 01:10:02,307
That night we moved closer to the border.

765
01:10:02,376 --> 01:10:05,607
And clear across the prairie
at the very edge of the horizon...

766
01:10:05,813 --> 01:10:09,340
...we could make out the gas fires
at the refineries at Missoula...

767
01:10:09,550 --> 01:10:12,815
...while to the south,
we could see the lights of Cheyenne...

768
01:10:12,887 --> 01:10:15,617
...a city bigger and grander
than I'd ever seen.

769
01:10:18,426 --> 01:10:22,760
I felt all kind of things lookin' at the lights
of Cheyenne, but most important...

770
01:10:22,830 --> 01:10:26,459
...l made up my mind to never again
tag around with the hell-bent type...

771
01:10:26,901 --> 01:10:29,199
...no matter how in love with him I was.

772
01:10:29,504 --> 01:10:31,995
Finally, I found the strength to tell Kit this.

773
01:10:32,373 --> 01:10:36,969
I pointed out that even if we got to the
far North, he still couldn't make a living.

774
01:10:39,814 --> 01:10:41,907
I can get a job with the Mounties.

775
01:10:42,517 --> 01:10:43,848
Northwest Mounties.

776
01:10:45,753 --> 01:10:48,119
Hell, I got all the qualifications.

777
01:10:49,157 --> 01:10:52,024
I can ride and shoot...

778
01:10:53,561 --> 01:10:54,550
...and...

779
01:10:55,263 --> 01:10:56,753
...l don't mind the cold.

780
01:10:58,166 --> 01:11:00,293
Matter of fact, I like the cold.

781
01:11:00,368 --> 01:11:01,198
What?

782
01:11:03,070 --> 01:11:04,128
Nothing.

783
01:11:05,273 --> 01:11:07,537
I was just runnin' off at the mouth.

784
01:11:08,442 --> 01:11:09,431
As usual.

785
01:11:10,244 --> 01:11:12,178
I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.

786
01:11:14,615 --> 01:11:16,344
Hey, man, don't lip it.

787
01:11:17,685 --> 01:11:18,674
Well...

788
01:11:19,887 --> 01:11:23,379
...you know, they'd probably ask
to see your driver's license...

789
01:11:23,457 --> 01:11:25,084
...before they'd hire you.

790
01:11:25,426 --> 01:11:27,917
Well, I'm not gonna let that stop me.

791
01:11:29,664 --> 01:11:31,791
-You smoke Pall Mall?
-Yeah.

792
01:11:35,236 --> 01:11:38,399
You haven't seen me when I'm goin'
after something, honey.

793
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:39,829
Tough.

794
01:11:43,444 --> 01:11:45,969
Hey, don't touch that! Nat King Cole!

795
01:11:46,113 --> 01:11:48,775
"You turned to me

796
01:11:49,650 --> 01:11:54,610
"The gypsies say, and I know why

797
01:11:56,657 --> 01:11:58,750
"A falling blossom

798
01:11:59,961 --> 01:12:03,453
"Only touches lips that lie

799
01:12:03,731 --> 01:12:05,756
"A blossom fell

800
01:12:06,868 --> 01:12:09,132
"And very soon

801
01:12:10,238 --> 01:12:13,674
"I saw you kissing someone new

802
01:12:14,508 --> 01:12:16,703
"Beneath the moon

803
01:12:17,278 --> 01:12:19,178
"I thought you loved me"

804
01:12:19,247 --> 01:12:20,874
If I could sing a song like that....

805
01:12:20,948 --> 01:12:22,882
"You said you loved me"

806
01:12:22,950 --> 01:12:25,180
If I could sing a song
about the way I feel now...

807
01:12:25,253 --> 01:12:28,279
"We planned together, to dream forever"

808
01:12:28,356 --> 01:12:29,687
...it'd be a hit.

809
01:12:31,626 --> 01:12:34,561
"The dream has ended

810
01:12:35,229 --> 01:12:38,221
"For true love died

811
01:12:38,833 --> 01:12:41,631
"The night a blossom fell

812
01:12:42,103 --> 01:12:45,630
"And touched two lips that lied"

813
01:13:12,667 --> 01:13:14,328
Kit knew the end was coming.

814
01:13:14,402 --> 01:13:17,200
He wondered if hed hear
the doctor pronounce him dead...

815
01:13:17,271 --> 01:13:20,934
...or if hed be able to read what the papers
would say about him the next day...

816
01:13:21,008 --> 01:13:22,339
...from the other side.

817
01:13:22,576 --> 01:13:25,511
He dreaded the idea
of being shot down alone, he said...

818
01:13:25,579 --> 01:13:27,877
...without a girl to scream out his name.

819
01:13:28,816 --> 01:13:32,115
Then, for an instant, the sight
of the mountains in the dawn light...

820
01:13:32,186 --> 01:13:33,847
...got his hopes back up.

821
01:13:34,522 --> 01:13:35,955
God, what a sight.

822
01:13:37,892 --> 01:13:39,519
Hey, tell me this, hon.

823
01:13:39,961 --> 01:13:43,192
What's a little Texas girl like yourself
think of a sight like that?

824
01:13:43,764 --> 01:13:46,892
"The dream has ended

825
01:13:47,468 --> 01:13:50,494
"For true love died

826
01:13:51,138 --> 01:13:54,335
"The night a blossom fell

827
01:13:55,042 --> 01:14:00,036
"And touched two lips that lied"

828
01:14:07,521 --> 01:14:08,749
Love this air.

829
01:14:14,195 --> 01:14:15,184
Mornin'!

830
01:14:16,731 --> 01:14:18,062
You got any gas?

831
01:14:20,301 --> 01:14:21,131
Maybe.

832
01:14:22,136 --> 01:14:25,333
Well, I'm sorry, sir,
but we got to ask you for it.

833
01:14:25,539 --> 01:14:27,973
We're about out, been drivin' all night.

834
01:14:28,309 --> 01:14:31,142
Actually, I don't even have time
to explain it to you.

835
01:14:31,412 --> 01:14:32,845
What I got I can't spare.

836
01:14:33,948 --> 01:14:35,176
Just a second now.

837
01:14:36,183 --> 01:14:37,673
That's your truck, isn't it?

838
01:14:37,852 --> 01:14:39,444
You didn't walk out here.

839
01:14:39,653 --> 01:14:41,177
It's mine all right.

840
01:14:42,256 --> 01:14:45,089
Well, listen, I'm gonna swap you
my Cadillac.

841
01:14:45,926 --> 01:14:48,520
Now, don't worry, you're gettin' a fair deal.

842
01:14:48,796 --> 01:14:50,161
Hell, ask anybody!

843
01:14:50,231 --> 01:14:52,699
What's the blue-book value
on this thing, Mildred?

844
01:14:56,203 --> 01:14:57,534
Who are you?

845
01:14:58,572 --> 01:15:02,099
Name's Carruthers.
Believe I shoot people every now and then.

846
01:15:02,243 --> 01:15:03,710
Not that I deserve a medal.

847
01:15:03,944 --> 01:15:04,933
Kit.

848
01:15:13,287 --> 01:15:14,311
Okay, friend...

849
01:15:14,722 --> 01:15:15,984
...start runnin'.

850
01:15:16,223 --> 01:15:18,384
-Give me a chance!
-Go on, git!

851
01:15:24,498 --> 01:15:26,659
I had a feelin' today was gonna be the day.

852
01:15:28,202 --> 01:15:30,170
-Helicopter.
-Yeah.

853
01:15:30,237 --> 01:15:32,102
He's not gonna take us for a ride, either.

854
01:15:32,173 --> 01:15:34,971
-Come on, let's make a run for the car.
-I don't want to.

855
01:15:37,244 --> 01:15:39,109
Have you got a better idea?

856
01:15:42,316 --> 01:15:43,806
I just don't want to go.

857
01:15:46,787 --> 01:15:47,617
What?

858
01:16:02,803 --> 01:16:04,464
What is wrong with you?

859
01:16:14,982 --> 01:16:16,745
What is the matter with you?

860
01:16:24,992 --> 01:16:27,222
I don't know what to make
of people like you.

861
01:16:28,529 --> 01:16:29,791
I really don't.

862
01:16:37,838 --> 01:16:39,829
You want a second chance, then listen.

863
01:16:40,007 --> 01:16:42,874
Twelve noon, the Grand Coulee Dam,
New Years Day, 1964.

864
01:16:42,943 --> 01:16:45,138
You meet me there. Now you got that?

865
01:17:53,414 --> 01:17:54,574
Hey! Anybody here?

866
01:17:56,083 --> 01:17:57,072
Hi.

867
01:17:59,853 --> 01:18:01,445
You got any shells for a Savage?

868
01:18:01,522 --> 01:18:02,853
300 Savage?

869
01:18:03,824 --> 01:18:04,586
Nope.

870
01:18:05,326 --> 01:18:08,159
Damn, I pissed all mine away
shootin' up bottles.

871
01:18:08,495 --> 01:18:10,986
Hey, you want to fill 'er up for me?
Please?

872
01:18:46,734 --> 01:18:48,702
You want any of that junk, it's yours.

873
01:20:57,998 --> 01:21:01,934
Many times I've wondered what was goin'
through Kit's head before they got him...

874
01:21:02,002 --> 01:21:05,301
...and why he didn't make a run for it
while he still had the chance.

875
01:21:05,539 --> 01:21:07,973
Did he figure theyd just catch him
the next day?

876
01:21:08,575 --> 01:21:09,837
Was it despair?

877
01:21:10,577 --> 01:21:12,408
He claimed to havin' a flat tire...

878
01:21:12,713 --> 01:21:15,841
...but the way he carried on about it
I imagine this is false.

879
01:22:13,707 --> 01:22:14,696
Hi.

880
01:22:15,275 --> 01:22:16,867
Hold it right there.

881
01:22:17,444 --> 01:22:20,709
I could've held off an army if I'd got
behind a boulder in the mountains.

882
01:22:20,781 --> 01:22:21,770
Yeah?

883
01:22:21,949 --> 01:22:23,780
As long as my ammo held out.

884
01:22:25,619 --> 01:22:27,780
Right there is where you caught me.

885
01:22:28,121 --> 01:22:29,554
We did it, Ray.

886
01:22:35,329 --> 01:22:37,854
You better not leave that Cadillac
sittin' out here.

887
01:22:38,098 --> 01:22:40,157
Put your hands on the back of your head.

888
01:22:42,202 --> 01:22:44,193
Now put the other one on yourself.

889
01:22:54,648 --> 01:22:56,639
Hell, he ain't no bigger than I am.

890
01:22:57,317 --> 01:22:58,648
Look at that.

891
01:23:01,221 --> 01:23:04,418
You're gonna give me
a cauliflowered ear, Sheriff.

892
01:23:05,192 --> 01:23:08,184
He should've thought about that
before he got caught.

893
01:23:09,429 --> 01:23:10,623
Shouldn't he?

894
01:23:27,848 --> 01:23:29,247
Think I'll take the juice?

895
01:23:31,618 --> 01:23:32,607
Beats me.

896
01:23:37,491 --> 01:23:40,460
Say what kind of rifle was that
you were shootin' at me?

897
01:23:40,727 --> 01:23:42,126
Thirty-aught six.

898
01:23:42,429 --> 01:23:44,727
You ever had to open up like that before?

899
01:23:44,898 --> 01:23:45,728
Nope.

900
01:23:50,337 --> 01:23:53,397
Well, you boys have performed
like a couple of heroes.

901
01:23:53,974 --> 01:23:57,341
Don't think I'm not gonna pass it around
when we get to town.

902
01:24:09,289 --> 01:24:11,484
You tossed my hat out the window.

903
01:24:11,625 --> 01:24:12,990
Want to sue me?

904
01:24:14,494 --> 01:24:15,358
No.

905
01:24:15,429 --> 01:24:16,191
Kit.

906
01:24:17,364 --> 01:24:19,457
Kit, I gotta question for you.

907
01:24:21,368 --> 01:24:22,460
You like people?

908
01:24:23,537 --> 01:24:24,526
They're okay.

909
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:27,868
Then why'd you do it?

910
01:24:30,544 --> 01:24:31,943
I don't know.

911
01:24:32,546 --> 01:24:36,141
I always wanted to be a criminal, I guess.
Just not this big of one.

912
01:24:38,185 --> 01:24:39,846
Takes all kinds, though.

913
01:24:45,859 --> 01:24:48,384
You know who that son of a bitch
looks like?

914
01:24:49,396 --> 01:24:50,590
You know, don't you?

915
01:24:51,198 --> 01:24:52,187
No.

916
01:24:52,866 --> 01:24:55,391
I'll kiss your ass if he don't look
like James Dean.

917
01:25:09,016 --> 01:25:10,506
How you doin' there, Kit?

918
01:25:10,584 --> 01:25:12,108
Fine as can be expected.

919
01:25:12,386 --> 01:25:13,944
Just locked up, can't move.

920
01:25:14,154 --> 01:25:15,883
Nice little coat you got on there.

921
01:25:15,956 --> 01:25:17,753
You think? It's leather.

922
01:25:18,425 --> 01:25:19,392
Hey.

923
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:22,419
Now, lookie here, here's a real prize.

924
01:25:22,496 --> 01:25:25,624
I must've had this about ten years.
Look there. Who's gonna get it?

925
01:25:25,699 --> 01:25:27,792
-Give me that son of a bitch.
-There you go.

926
01:25:27,868 --> 01:25:29,301
Where you from?

927
01:25:29,569 --> 01:25:31,161
South Dakota, where you from?

928
01:25:31,238 --> 01:25:32,227
Here.

929
01:25:33,273 --> 01:25:34,604
Want a comb?

930
01:25:35,575 --> 01:25:37,304
Joni James is from South Dakota.

931
01:25:37,377 --> 01:25:39,504
Yeah, I know. She got out of there, too.

932
01:25:39,579 --> 01:25:41,308
Kit, who's your favorite singer?

933
01:25:41,381 --> 01:25:44,077
-Eddie Fisher, who's yours?
-Eddie Fisher.

934
01:25:44,151 --> 01:25:46,085
Damn! You want a pen?

935
01:25:47,454 --> 01:25:48,682
How old are you?

936
01:25:48,755 --> 01:25:50,518
Don't you read the papers?

937
01:25:50,724 --> 01:25:52,692
-You ever been married?
-No, I haven't.

938
01:25:52,859 --> 01:25:54,156
-Hey, Kit.
-Yeah?

939
01:25:54,461 --> 01:25:56,053
You afraid of death?

940
01:25:57,564 --> 01:25:59,259
I haven't thought about it much.

941
01:26:01,435 --> 01:26:02,424
Say again.

942
01:26:07,941 --> 01:26:10,501
I don't mean to tell you
how to run your show here...

943
01:26:10,577 --> 01:26:13,603
...but these cuffs are pinchin' some.
What do you say now?

944
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:16,740
I need to get your signature
on some paperwork here, Kit.

945
01:26:16,817 --> 01:26:20,548
Well, I'll have to read 'em first.
Suppose I could get a coke while I do?

946
01:26:20,620 --> 01:26:21,848
Sure thing.

947
01:26:22,055 --> 01:26:22,953
Come on.

948
01:26:24,658 --> 01:26:27,456
-You boys keep out of trouble.
-Don't worry about us.

949
01:26:27,527 --> 01:26:30,587
Holly's over here, Kit,
if you want to see her.

950
01:26:30,664 --> 01:26:31,653
Sure.

951
01:26:38,004 --> 01:26:41,838
I gave him the papers to sign.
Don't let him get into trouble.

952
01:26:41,908 --> 01:26:44,308
You want to give me a little slack there?

953
01:26:49,516 --> 01:26:50,505
Hi.

954
01:26:58,625 --> 01:27:01,560
Don't worry now.
I'm gonna get you off these charges.

955
01:27:01,628 --> 01:27:04,495
There's a whole lot of other boys
out there waitin' for you.

956
01:27:04,564 --> 01:27:06,225
You're gonna have a lot of fun.

957
01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:14,402
Boy, we rang the bell, didn't we?

958
01:27:17,477 --> 01:27:19,274
I'll say this though.

959
01:27:20,313 --> 01:27:22,440
That guy with the deaf maid?

960
01:27:22,783 --> 01:27:24,808
He's just lucky he's not dead, too.

961
01:27:32,659 --> 01:27:34,957
'Course, too bad about your dad.

962
01:27:36,863 --> 01:27:37,852
Yeah.

963
01:27:39,166 --> 01:27:42,795
We're gonna have to sit down
and talk about that sometime.

964
01:28:36,656 --> 01:28:38,021
There you go, Tom.

965
01:28:39,259 --> 01:28:40,089
Thank you.

966
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:42,560
Thank you very much, Chief Sims.

967
01:28:42,896 --> 01:28:46,297
-Sorry if I caused you any inconvenience.
-You didn't cause me any trouble.

968
01:28:46,366 --> 01:28:47,799
Thanks anyway.

969
01:28:48,668 --> 01:28:49,726
Well....

970
01:28:51,738 --> 01:28:52,500
Kit.

971
01:28:52,572 --> 01:28:53,368
Tom.

972
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:54,702
-Good luck to you.
-Thank you.

973
01:28:54,774 --> 01:28:57,242
-I mean it.
-I know you do. Good luck to you, too.

974
01:28:57,444 --> 01:28:58,342
Now we'll go.

975
01:28:58,411 --> 01:28:59,878
Okay. Thank you.

976
01:29:01,681 --> 01:29:02,909
Come on, Red.

977
01:29:21,434 --> 01:29:23,766
Kit and I were taken back to South Dakota.

978
01:29:24,070 --> 01:29:25,697
They kept him in solitary...

979
01:29:25,772 --> 01:29:28,832
...so he didn't have a chance
to get to know the other inmates...

980
01:29:28,909 --> 01:29:32,174
...though he was sure they'd like him,
especially the murderers.

981
01:29:32,445 --> 01:29:36,279
Myself, I got off with probation
and a lot of nasty looks.

982
01:29:36,850 --> 01:29:39,944
Later, I married the son of the lawyer
who defended me.

983
01:29:42,555 --> 01:29:46,082
Kit went to sleep in the courtroom
while his confession was bein' read...

984
01:29:46,159 --> 01:29:48,855
...and he was sentenced to die
in the electric chair.

985
01:29:48,995 --> 01:29:51,896
On a warm, spring night,
six months later...

986
01:29:52,265 --> 01:29:55,029
...after donatin' his body to science, he did.

987
01:30:00,006 --> 01:30:00,665
Sir?

988
01:30:01,942 --> 01:30:03,409
Where'd you get that hat?

989
01:30:03,743 --> 01:30:04,505
State.

990
01:30:06,646 --> 01:30:09,137
Boy, I'd like to buy me one of them.

991
01:30:10,283 --> 01:30:12,376
You're quite an individual, Kit.

992
01:30:17,691 --> 01:30:20,251
Think they'll take that into consideration?
