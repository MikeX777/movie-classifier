Excuse me, let me through.

9
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,393
Everything's OK, it's OK.

10
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:14,263
No pets allowed here.

11
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:15,500
You have it all wrong.

12
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:17,132
No more excuses.

13
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,274
You were walking a really huge one!

14
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,338
Don't be ridiculous.

15
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:25,043
A giant lizard with a huge tail

16
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:27,381
bit the people in #301.

17
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:28,454
Don't ask me!

18
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:29,886
It's a public nuisance.

19
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:31,047
Go away!

20
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:32,955
Stop it!

21
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:33,889
Let me look!

22
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:35,051
I'll sue you!

23
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:38,358
Oh, look, it's a lizard!

24
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:40,626
That's my wife, my wife!

25
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:41,995
Stop it!

26
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,196
Don't! She hates flashes!

27
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,568
Yes, yes.

28
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,547
Are you going or not?

29
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:57,909
Five more minutes.

30
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:00,317
It'll get dark.

31
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,546
Right, right.

32
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,561
Hello, it's Naosuke.

33
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:22,203
I really don't know about Godzilla,
it's just too far out.

34
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:25,740
We did all that monster stuff
to death before.

35
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:29,710
Just changing Godzilla
to Mechagodzilla,

36
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,614
doesn't change
the fundamental problem.

37
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,244
Oh, I'm sorry, I'll call you back.

38
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,253
Sorry, sorry.

39
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,434
Hey, what's that?

40
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:51,835
What is this?

41
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:55,406
It's a well.

42
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:09,385
The supermarket's behind the forest,
there's a school over there.

43
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:12,458
And a police box nearby
so it's safe at night.

44
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,587
So what do you think?

45
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,529
We're going to live here forever.

46
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:23,461
That's right, until we're
grandma and grandpa together.

47
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:25,729
What shall we build...

48
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:27,738
Something stylish.

49
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:29,134
Yeah.

50
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:41,352
ALL ABOUT OUR HOUSE

51
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:45,413
Plans are Ever ything

52
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:50,262
I think we ought to move away
from the monster motlf.

53
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:57,094
No, no, not that...
Right, right, right...

54
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,238
Sorry, sorry.

55
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:10,107
Now, what about the plans?

56
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:11,080
An architect?

57
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:14,517
What if we get someone
with terrible taste?

58
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:15,713
A house is forever.

59
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:16,584
Your father?

60
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:18,657
Him? He's just a contractor.

61
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:19,486
He can't draw plans?

62
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,493
I don't think so.
A contractor's not an architect.

63
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:25,153
But he might know someone who can.

64
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,357
Excuse me.

65
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:27,922
Coffee.

66
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:31,801
He pals around with old guys.

67
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:34,563
Who knows what that bunch of
geezers would build.

68
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,164
Your Dad would love it.

69
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,302
We're not doing this
to make him happy.

70
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:44,645
Remember Yanagisawa,
the interior designer?

71
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:47,042
He created that table for us.

72
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:48,085
Huh?

73
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:49,347
How about him?

74
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,547
For what?

75
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:54,650
For our house plans.
C'mon, pay attention.

76
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,422
What?

77
00:04:56,863 --> 00:05:01,562
His main thing is furniture but
he does interiors, too.

78
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:02,999
Really?

79
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:07,401
We could ask a regular architect,
but it might turn out stuffy.

80
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:11,770
Yanagisawa can give us
a contemporary feel.

81
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,345
That sounds good.

82
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:15,106
Are you serious?

83
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:16,704
Yes I am.

84
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:20,217
Your work's important,
but it's our house!

85
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:24,489
I think he'd be great,
let's hire Yanagisawa...

86
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:27,559
I mean, who else can handle it?

87
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:33,957
A Martian, yes, just go for it.

88
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:37,002
Bring in a Martian at the end.

89
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,162
What, you serious? Yeah, yeah, yes...

90
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,473
Hello.

91
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:49,078
It's been awhile.

92
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,946
You look the same. Any children?

93
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:54,485
Not yet. I know you're busy.

94
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:55,986
Don't mention it.

95
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,350
For real?

96
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:02,358
I'm just on my way out.
A place I designed opens tomorrow.

97
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,517
Oh my.

98
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:05,195
Why don't you join me?

99
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:06,526
Why sure.

100
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:09,725
You sure I'm right for it?

101
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,361
Oh, yes, we want you.

102
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,939
But I've only done interiors.

103
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,533
We just know
you'll do a great job, right?

104
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:22,205
You know, I've always wanted
to design a house.

105
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:25,716
Really? So it's perfect, then.

106
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,185
You look awfully pale. Are you OK?

107
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:31,481
Are you sick?

108
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,218
I'm just...

109
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,816
You're carsick?

110
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:36,927
We're almost there.

111
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:46,931
Here.

112
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,438
Thanks.

113
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:49,870
Am I a wild driver?

114
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:54,310
It's not that.
I didn't get much sleep last night.

115
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:58,809
So?

116
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:04,120
You'll design us a special house,
something unconventional.

117
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:07,252
I mean, this place is great.

118
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:08,758
It's so cool.

119
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:12,854
My theme was the fusion of
tradition and modernlsm.

120
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:15,598
I tried to make it authentic.

121
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:18,465
Now I really want to do

122
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:21,972
something based on
mid-century Modernism,

123
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:24,440
architecture of the '50s and '60s.

124
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:28,445
I'm most inspired by
Rudolf Schindler's Americanism.

125
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:32,507
But for the right fee,
I'd design anything, even this place.

126
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:33,641
Excuse me.

127
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:37,450
What do you think?

128
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:40,856
For a hot designer ,
he's not that pretentious.

129
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,518
Don't have a clue
what he means, but...

130
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,730
I think he'l be fine.

131
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,567
No!

132
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:52,466
Why can't you do it like I said!

133
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,734
The intervals have to be equal!

134
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:59,471
This is just one big mess!

135
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,273
Do it over.

136
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:04,781
Tomorrow's the opening, you idiot!

137
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:11,385
I'd love to take the job.

138
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,650
There's just one problem.

139
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:19,864
I'm not a licensed architect,
so I can't apply for city permits.

140
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,297
You need a license?

141
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:26,201
Yeah, what if I design it, but
someone else draws up the final plans?

142
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:30,139
That much my father can handle.
He's licensed, after all.

143
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:33,303
That's right,
your father's a contractor.

144
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:34,640
Would you ask him?

145
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,147
Hello.

146
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:47,993
Oh, so you found it.
Why that's wonderful.

147
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,525
The thing is,

148
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:54,357
what would you think
if we asked Dad to build it?

149
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:58,901
He's an old man, now.
Is he still up to it?

150
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:03,908
I've heard his work is still meticulous.
I'm sure he'd be delighted.

151
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,808
Hold on a minute,
he's cutting his toenails.

152
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:09,309
It's Tamiko, your daughter, dear.

153
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,776
They found their land.

154
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,453
She wants to ask you a favor.

155
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:20,517
So the deal ls, we're having
someone else draw up the plans.

156
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:25,290
But we want you to get
the permits and build it.

157
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,534
Sure.

158
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:33,802
Are you sure?
And build the house, too?

159
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:38,772
Someone else is drawing up the plans.

160
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,713
I'm not sure he gets it.

161
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:47,651
Yes. Good night then.

162
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,954
Did you accept?

163
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:55,952
How would I know?
Whether or not I'm doing it...

164
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,091
You'll be getting busier .

165
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,822
It's due at the end of the month.

166
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,262
The Martians OK?

167
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,891
How's your house? You find land?

168
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:38,027
It's in the country.

169
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,900
What do you want for a house-warming?

170
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:40,802
Thank you.

171
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:43,306
Call the maestro a taxi.

172
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:48,443
The plans?

173
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:52,948
I already told you,
we've hired a deslgner, Yanagisawa.

174
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:53,950
Who's that?

175
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:56,044
I knew him in college.

176
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,246
You'd trust a kid like that?

177
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:00,348
He's an interior designer now.

178
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,154
Specializes in Modernlsm.

179
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,125
Never heard of it.

180
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,925
Mid-century at that, Father.

181
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:07,258
Mid-sentence?

182
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,295
Are you up to this?

183
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:10,300
To what?

184
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:13,634
You actually have to talk to him.
He's a modernist, you know.

185
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,934
The hell with modernism.

186
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:19,636
Thing about a house is,
it's got to be sturdy...

187
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,911
Isn't that right, Naosuke?

188
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:22,912
Yes.

189
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:30,251
Wow, design a house!

190
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:33,017
Yeah, however I want.

191
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:36,390
Finally, your dream come true.

192
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,454
Wonderful.

193
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:39,758
Come let me show you.

194
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:40,627
What?

195
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:41,461
Thank you.

196
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:44,035
What, what?

197
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:49,506
And the Japanese style room?
That's what I'm worried about.

198
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:50,597
What do you say?

199
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,578
I think we can skip it.
We'd never use it anyway.

200
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,516
Do you think we need one?

201
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:03,955
But when you get older,
you'll really wish you had one.

202
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,546
Of course.

203
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:09,287
Instead of a Japanese room,
make a bigger living room.

204
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,057
What do you know, you brat.

205
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:15,065
Would you like some more potatoes?

206
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:16,429
Yes I would.

207
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:20,263
When will the plans be ready?

208
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:23,136
Yanagisawa's thinking about them now.

209
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,375
What's your schedule?

210
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,440
Me? I don't really
have a definite schedule.

211
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:36,146
Get me the plans, the plans.

212
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,482
In any case, Naosuke.

213
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,992
I'm excited about it.

214
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:49,059
You think he's up to it?

215
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,335
He's certainly gung ho.

216
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,871
I'm really worried.

217
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,437
I think he was overjoyed
when you called to ask.

218
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:01,774
He started calling around
right afterwards.

219
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,246
Around?

220
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,907
His old crew.

221
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:09,748
Recently he's been sub-contracting
for sub-contractors.

222
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:13,354
Finally, he's got a job
he can sink his teeth into.

223
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,618
...makes a world of difference.

224
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,328
I see your point.

225
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,492
The thing about that place...

226
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:23,590
What about it?

227
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:26,865
Nothing blocks the wind.
It'll blow right at you.

228
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,065
Gotta build it to stand up to it.

229
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,164
I understand.

230
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:32,267
Since when are you the expert?

231
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,681
I already checked it out.
Got a problem?

232
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:39,808
You already went?

233
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,250
He's pretty into it.

234
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,150
Listen up, guys.

235
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,714
Yes.

236
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:48,960
Don't mess with that wind.

237
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:50,660
That wind.

238
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,351
Tamiko, Tamiko.

239
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:26,992
About that Japanese room,
your father's dead set on it.

240
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,465
What with the craze for
Western houses,

241
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:34,369
he hasn't had a crack at a real
Japanese room for some time.

242
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:35,462
Sounds good to me.

243
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:38,236
There you go, caving in again.

244
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:41,878
For years and years,
he's followed customers' orders.

245
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,482
Who knows how many years
he's got left.

246
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:47,916
Just this once,
can't you let him do as he pleases?

247
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,419
I can relate.

248
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:52,752
He's got something in mind
for that Japanese room.

249
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,553
Let's talk to Yanagisawa.

250
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,649
Put it on hold.

251
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:56,750
Think about it?

252
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:59,330
Why can't Dad tell us himself?

253
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:00,955
You know how he is.

254
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:01,725
See you.

255
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:02,766
Good night.

256
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:03,892
'Night.

257
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:08,639
Let's let him build one.

258
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,535
For you Dad.

259
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:13,236
You sure have a soft spot
for him, don't you?

260
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:20,007
I love that old time craftsmanship.
Let's do it for him...

261
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,555
Don't be ridiculous.

262
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:37,364
Something with a razor sharp head
just attacked the people in #401.

263
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:38,525
Don't ask me!

264
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:39,865
This is a public nuisance.

265
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:40,961
Go away!

266
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:43,099
Stop it!

267
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,004
Let me look!

268
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,269
I'll sue you!

269
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,671
Oh, look, it's a Martian!

270
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:52,342
That's my wife, my wife!

271
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,043
Stop it!

272
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,548
Don't! She hates flashes!

273
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:11,592
A big roof makes big snow drifts
- Afghani proverb

274
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,628
Hear about the Japanese room?

275
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:45,130
- Forget it if it's too much.
- Not a problem.

276
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:45,999
But...

277
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:50,769
But that's real y not my domain,
so why not leave it to him?

278
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,036
Thanks for understanding.

279
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:56,478
I wanted you to get an idea,
so I came up with this.

280
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:01,446
Just an idea.

281
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,212
If you like it, I'll draw up plans.

282
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,092
Wow!

283
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,184
The basic concept is:
The Simpler The Better.

284
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:12,820
I went for perpendicular angles.

285
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:14,023
Let's go inside.

286
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,031
We can?

287
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:17,728
Not really.
It's just a general idea.

288
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:20,634
This is the entrance.

289
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,739
I want the living room to be open.

290
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:26,504
In contrast to the exterior,
the 1st floor 's all about horizontal.

291
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:30,348
No unnecessary vertical lines,
in the Schindler Frame style.

292
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:33,144
As for wall colors, see this window?

293
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,116
Yes.

294
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:38,383
It maximizes both natural sunlight
and resultant shadows.

295
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,753
I want to draw out the inherent
texture of the materials.

296
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:44,395
What's called " soft monotone.''

297
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:47,863
Steven Hall adapted
this approach from Schindler.

298
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:49,661
Onto the 2nd floor.

299
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:55,664
Haven't seen you since we build
that professor's mansion together.

300
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,639
That's right.

301
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,404
That was one sturdy house.

302
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:02,378
Put a lot of time and effort
into that one.

303
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:06,674
Who makes your hearing aid?

304
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:11,145
We built a professor's house?

305
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,721
You were out with a diabetes attack.

306
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,854
Who did the paint finishes?

307
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,563
It was Morl.

308
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:22,965
Oh, I remember Mori.

309
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:25,161
What's he up to now?

310
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,000
Died last year. Hls lungs...

311
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,438
Hey, who makes your hearing aid?

312
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,100
They're dying like flies.

313
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:34,111
Dldn't Mori run the marathon?

314
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:37,148
That was old Kurosawa.

315
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:40,748
The old man, huh.
Brings back memories.

316
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:44,550
He died last month.
His lymph nodes...

317
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:47,452
The old man died?

318
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:53,395
I'm so happy to be working
with you again, chief.

319
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:54,796
I'm serious.

320
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,301
Me too, back with the old gang.

321
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:02,332
Makes it worth still being alive
al these years.

322
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:06,477
Hey, does your hearing aid work?
C'mon, man...

323
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:11,675
Listen guys, my heart actually
stopped beating last year.

324
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,079
I'm officially disabled.

325
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:20,589
Yanagisawa called to say he's late.
The traffic's really bad.

326
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:21,757
Please.

327
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,122
Thank you.

328
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:27,030
Suga will apply for the permits.

329
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,632
Not you, Dad?

330
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:33,362
I've got a second class license,
so I can't get any permits.

331
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,507
Suga's is first class.

332
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:36,934
Very nice to meet you.

333
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:39,135
I hope I can be of help.

334
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:44,346
His father's an architect, too.

335
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,040
I see.

336
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:49,243
My son-in-law writes TV scripts.

337
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:50,682
I see.

338
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:53,485
His scripts have a satirical touch.
Wonderful stuff.

339
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,653
Watch your sugar intake, Dad.

340
00:19:56,828 --> 00:20:00,059
I'm fine.
Workmen need their energy.

341
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:01,865
Yanagisawa.

342
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:03,059
I'll get it.

343
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:11,971
Oh, chief,
have a look at our last job.

344
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:16,970
Great house.
It looks really sturdy.

345
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:19,944
These new houses are no good.

346
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,350
They only care how it looks.

347
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,024
Yanagisawa.

348
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:27,421
Sorry to be late.

349
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:31,459
May I introduce Yanagisawa,
he's designing the house.

350
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:32,789
My father .

351
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,259
I'm Iwata.

352
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,631
I'm Yanagisawa.

353
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:40,601
This is the architect.

354
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:43,002
I'm with Suga Architects.

355
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,274
He's handling the permits.

356
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,344
Nice to meet you.

357
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:47,503
Llkewlse.

358
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:49,240
Are they ready?

359
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:54,952
Let's sit here. Dad, take a seat.

360
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:58,446
Well, this is the general idea
I'm working with.

361
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:03,861
Such details...

362
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:05,293
Wonderful.

363
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:11,727
There may be some adjustments,
of course.

364
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:22,269
You drew these?

365
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:24,175
Yes.

366
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,950
Just what you'd expect...

367
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,752
From an Art school graduate.

368
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,021
What do you think?

369
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,289
It won't work.

370
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:37,622
What's the...

371
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:40,389
It violates construction code.

372
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:41,659
Violates code?

373
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:46,295
Your land is zoned exclusively
for Class 1 homes.

374
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:49,863
You can't just go and build
to any height you please.

375
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:52,936
You'll never get a permit for this.

376
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,914
What if we ignore that?

377
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,940
They'll tear it down.

378
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,090
I'm sorry, but...

379
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:15,426
You'll have to start over again.

380
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,432
This is giving me a headache.

381
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,402
Don't worry about me.

382
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:26,736
As long as I get a bigger study,
I'm fine.

383
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:48,056
Those plans are hopeless.
They'll never work.

384
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,293
Why are you so negative?

385
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:53,667
Yanagisawa said he'll rethink them.

386
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:57,673
What are you gonna do?
Suga's in a real bind, here.

387
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:59,107
Suga, talk to her?

388
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,008
Oh, no thank you.

389
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:08,453
We've already hired him.

390
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:13,883
We've made our decislon.
Can't you try to be more generous?

391
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,928
In any case, these are useless.

392
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:22,732
Just in case, you draw up some plans.

393
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:26,934
But what about your daughter?

394
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:30,599
If it comes to that,
I'll talk to her.

395
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:33,708
I'l do my best.

396
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:37,539
You live in a house for decades.

397
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:40,440
You can't just throw it together.

398
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:49,088
Come in.

399
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,086
Thanks for coming over.

400
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:54,791
My wife wanted to join us
but she's got school now.

401
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,165
Unfortunately,
I'm on my way out, too.

402
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,635
I won't be long.

403
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:02,502
We can leave together in 5 minutes.

404
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,200
Come on in.

405
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:07,745
Hey, rise and shine.

406
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,311
Take a seat.

407
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:21,822
About yesterday,
I just hadn't done my homework.

408
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:24,459
Well, neither had we.

409
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:27,327
I need 3 days to draw up new plans.

410
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:28,860
That'll be great.

411
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:43,772
Say, you write that TV series
"Nutty Apartments?"

412
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:44,814
Well, yes.

413
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:47,043
Where do you get those ideas?

414
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,882
You could say I eke them out
of myself by sheer force.

415
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:52,013
That's hard work, every week.

416
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:53,283
It is.

417
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:58,385
Yanagisawa, hurry.

418
00:24:58,497 --> 00:24:59,486
What?

419
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:02,163
She's about to roll...

420
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:08,804
You can't expose yourself like that
in front of a guest!

421
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:11,273
Hurry up and turn over!

422
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,138
Turn over !

423
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:17,609
I just restored thls.

424
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:21,015
I'm on my way to deliver it now.
Can I give you a lift?

425
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,155
Sorry, be right back.

426
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:33,526
Go right ahead.

427
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,999
Any problems since then?

428
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:42,300
The cabinet windows are
a little heavy.

429
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:47,242
That glass ls kind of thick.
It's got its own charm, but...

430
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:49,905
I'll take a look. We can change it.

431
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:53,678
I think you should wear
that apron a little lower.

432
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:55,218
Oh.

433
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:58,912
This place too?

434
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:02,391
I know the manager,
so I just lent a hand.

435
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:04,689
It's great.

436
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,724
Sorry, call waiting.

437
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:10,624
I found this table in New York.

438
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:14,100
Really? It's got real heft.

439
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:17,774
How would I know? Find it yourself.

440
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:21,105
Are you the president?

441
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:22,509
I guess I am.

442
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:24,241
But you're so young.

443
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:27,580
I quit my former job and
started it with friends.

444
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:30,814
It's just me now. Excuse me.

445
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,520
Just go buy it, go for it.

446
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:37,955
Wait a sec. What?

447
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:40,054
Go outside, you're making a racket.

448
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:42,964
Hang up.

449
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:44,726
Gotta call you back.

450
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:45,825
Now!

451
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:50,003
Go gossip at Starbucks.

452
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:54,043
This place is all about atmosphere.
That's the whole concept.

453
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:59,947
I've never actually
worked for a company.

454
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:02,612
After college...

455
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,280
He told me to go
"gosslp at Starbucks."

456
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,429
Which of you assholes
picked on my girl?

457
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:26,077
Use the phone outside.

458
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:28,912
Who the hell are you?

459
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:31,505
You don't belong here.

460
00:27:57,142 --> 00:28:00,305
Oh, we'll pay their check.

461
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:01,673
Thank you.

462
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:12,483
Excuse me.

463
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:30,702
He says he'll finish the new plans
by Friday, so let's just wait.

464
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,137
I'm hungry.

465
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:34,177
Right up. Sukiyaki OK?

466
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,803
We have that nice beef.

467
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:36,744
Great.

468
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:38,748
Yanagisawa wasn't down?

469
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,408
Didn't seem like it.

470
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:43,112
Oh, good.
You stay on top of it, OK?

471
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,655
We can leave the rest up to them.

472
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:48,551
Aren't you worried?

473
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:52,994
Sure, but I've got
my own work to do.

474
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:55,490
Doesn't it matter to you?

475
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,931
That's not fair.

476
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:58,366
Whatever.

477
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:00,395
I'm doing my best...

478
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:03,941
This solves the permit problem.

479
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:06,101
It's looking good, isn't it?

480
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:09,510
You can see it
from different angles.

481
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:12,308
Looking good, looking good.

482
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,679
And your wife?

483
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:15,514
She's put me in charge.

484
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:17,043
Father?

485
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:18,919
Got a pen?

486
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:21,218
Yes, here.

487
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:22,686
What do you say?

488
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:24,284
Hey, wait, what are you doing?

489
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:25,384
Central pillar.

490
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:27,362
You don't need a pillar there!

491
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:31,029
What's a house
without a central pillar.

492
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:36,164
You need to rethink your ideas.

493
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:39,638
Hey, what have we here?

494
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:40,802
What?

495
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:42,205
Look at this.

496
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:46,244
This way, the main door opens in.

497
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:49,252
You're right.
Good thing you caught it.

498
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:51,379
What a joke.

499
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:53,252
It's supposed to open in.

500
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:55,519
What... did you just say?

501
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:58,027
I want it to open in.

502
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:00,387
Hear that, Suga?

503
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:03,524
What, is it a huge problem?

504
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:07,495
I've never heard
of a door that opens in.

505
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:09,266
Most American houses...

506
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:12,810
Where the hell are we!
I thought this was Japan!

507
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:14,742
My inspiration is Americanism.

508
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:19,647
Then get yourself an American
contractor! I'm not up to it.

509
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:21,283
Father.

510
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:24,887
Naosuke.

511
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:29,258
Sorry but I just quit.

512
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,520
Please, wait.

513
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:34,997
I sympathlze, but Western houses
are built on bigger lots.

514
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:36,157
Let me...

515
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:40,397
Japanese building is all about
how to maximize limited space.

516
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:43,167
And so our doors open out.

517
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:46,368
But take another look, Suga san.
I've added

518
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:49,776
extra space in the front hall
for just that reason.

519
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:51,644
Oh, I see your point.

520
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:53,580
Take a closer look.

521
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:06,863
Never seen such a thing.

522
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:12,264
I know, I know.

523
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:16,531
What if it swung both ways,
llke a Western saloon?

524
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,802
That's not the point.

525
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:21,611
I've never seen one like it!

526
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,879
Oh, man.

527
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:34,249
It's really complicated, isn't it?
Building a house.

528
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,554
Maybe we should've just bought one.

529
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:39,387
Just kidding.

530
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:43,092
The chief's so serious,
he doesn't get my jokes.

531
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:44,132
Naosuke.

532
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,463
Yes, Father.

533
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:47,230
This maestro here.

534
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:51,741
Hasn't really been on
many construction sites, has he?

535
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:54,810
It's the first time
he's designed a house.

536
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,346
My specialty is furniture.

537
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:59,712
I don't care what
your damn specialty is.

538
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:02,684
You gotta know the nuts and bolts.

539
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:05,919
What a waste of time.

540
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:08,857
Excuse me, but I've got experience.

541
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,927
You do?

542
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:12,189
Rart-time construction work
in the U.S.

543
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:13,921
Part-time...

544
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:21,428
Chief, you should learn more
about architectural styles.

545
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,909
Your way isn't necessarily
the only way.

546
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:31,579
Father, watch your salt intake.

547
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:33,310
Don't worry, Naosuke.

548
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,383
Workmen on construction sites sweat!

549
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:58,741
The way I see it,

550
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:04,104
Dad's only ever built houses
the old-fashioned way, so he's at a loss.

551
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,412
That chief...

552
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:10,916
But we want you to design
the house your way.

553
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:12,847
So you just go right ahead.

554
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:14,083
Right ahead.

555
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:19,319
And what about the door, then?

556
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:30,063
The truth is, it doesn't matter

557
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:31,670
which way the door opens.

558
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:35,041
Well, if that's how you feel...

559
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,979
That's now what I...

560
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:41,280
Can't you save his pride?

561
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,878
Have it open out?

562
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:49,419
Well, I guess.

563
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:51,954
I'm sorry.

564
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:54,221
I don't...

565
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:58,493
Actually, Dad used to
do interiors, too.

566
00:33:58,669 --> 00:33:59,829
I see.

567
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:02,065
Sorry...

568
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:04,764
Not design, but finish work.

569
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:09,370
Actually, the two of you
have a lot in common.

570
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,683
This is it, this is it.

571
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:22,448
This is the house I wanted to build.

572
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:25,925
Oh, don't trouble yourself.

573
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:29,397
Now these are what
I call professional drawings.

574
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,694
Much obliged.

575
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:35,367
This curving veranda.
Has that storybook feel.

576
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:39,500
I had to consider that
it's a home for a young couple.

577
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:42,769
I'll talk to Tamiko about it.

578
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:47,317
Your third house is the perfect one
- ancient Japanese proverb

579
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:55,285
So you found a great property.

580
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:56,655
Thanks to you, Mother.

581
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:57,785
Not at all.

582
00:34:57,895 --> 00:34:58,554
Why?

583
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:01,860
Mother told us the feng-shui
on the property was good.

584
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:05,196
That land lies directly
south-southeast of here.

585
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:09,932
If you move south-southeast
by next year, you'll have great luck.

586
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:11,564
Show me the plans.

587
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:13,075
They're not final yet.

588
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:14,872
The front door can't face east.

589
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:16,411
Really?

590
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:19,242
Or your husband will
stop coming home.

591
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,012
Which way's east?

592
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,582
This way.

593
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:25,053
Fine, t's facing south.

594
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:26,851
Oh, good.

595
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:28,720
What's this, the study?

596
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:34,026
The study, the master's room,
should face northwest.

597
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,064
What'll we do?

598
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:37,464
That's enough. Go home.

599
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:40,599
But you're older than my son,
so maybe...

600
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:44,938
But really, his study should
be closer to the living room.

601
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:49,138
He's tends to brood,
so it's bad for him to be isolated.

602
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:50,680
Should've sald so sooner.

603
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:52,612
Should've shown me sooner.

604
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:55,047
I'll speak to my father about it.

605
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:58,013
It's just an idea.
It's not such a big deal.

606
00:35:58,122 --> 00:36:01,853
The thing is,
you build the house your way.

607
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:04,653
Our ancestors gave us feng-shul.

608
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:09,995
But take the advice you like
and then do what you want.

609
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:11,123
Sure.

610
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:15,899
But, since you're building,
might as well as make it auspicious.

611
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,231
Does the kitchen face south?

612
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,440
Great, you've thought it out.

613
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:23,537
And the bedroom faces... north.

614
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:25,980
It really should face west...

615
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:30,076
Oh, I know!
You need a small pond in the garden.

616
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:33,214
A heart-shaped pond
in the south brings luck!

617
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:34,655
Tell your father, OK?

618
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:37,057
Where's the washing machine?

619
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:40,759
"Build the house your way,"
with all those conditlons?

620
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,356
They're just suggestions, you know.

621
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:45,992
Now she says
the bedroom should face west.

622
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:48,094
Forget the pond.
What a pain to clean.

623
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:51,107
Remember my friend Iriuchijima?

624
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:54,334
His parents had a pond
in their garden,

625
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:57,175
with a really big Mannequin Ris.

626
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:58,179
Huh...

627
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,680
In Belglum, it brings luck.

628
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:04,882
I don't believe it.
It looked so silly.

629
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:07,423
You can't take all
that stuff seriously.

630
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:13,461
So the washing machine should
face south, but in my study?

631
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:21,701
Hello.

632
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:25,367
Naosuke? Can I speak to Tamiko?

633
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:27,034
Just one more thing.

634
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:28,668
Hold on.

635
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:31,941
My Mom.

636
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,355
Hi, it's Tamiko.

637
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:51,993
Llsten, about the toilet.
There's only one on the 2nd floor.

638
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,398
You really need one
on the 1st floor, too.

639
00:37:56,507 --> 00:38:00,876
A house with no 1st floor toilet
lasts only 3 generations!

640
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:04,141
What a horrible thought!
I'm begging you.

641
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:07,240
Speak to your father about it, OK?

642
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:11,779
If you're going to
have a toilet, I'd say here.

643
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:15,949
It's near the entrance,
convenient for guests.

644
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,152
What do you think?

645
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:19,695
The end of the hall facing south.

646
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:21,898
Hey, hey.

647
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,731
You never make a toilet face south.

648
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:28,632
The trouble with amateurs...

649
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,132
Why waste sunlight on a toilet?

650
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:35,701
You don't get it.
You want it bathed in sunlight.

651
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,646
Bathrooms always face north.

652
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:41,741
Making a bathroom dark is outdated.

653
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:46,418
I'm taking a leak.

654
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,054
Excuse me.

655
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:55,959
Miss, where's the bathroom?

656
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:03,534
Which means... Due north.
Thank you!

657
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:09,939
On the northern...

658
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:14,210
boulevard of bars...

659
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:16,716
You really need one
on the 1st floor?

660
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:21,019
Without one, the house is doomed
after 3 generations, oh boy.

661
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:22,816
What am I supposed to do?

662
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,686
You decide.
It's your house, after all.

663
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:34,768
I know.

664
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:38,333
We'll have 2. One north, one south.

665
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:41,000
Who needs so many toilets?

666
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:42,545
It was the only way.

667
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:44,136
And the 2nd floor?

668
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:45,112
Another one.

669
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:48,515
What do we need
so many tollets for?

670
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:49,313
Just 3.

671
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,388
A house full of toilets! Yuck!

672
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:53,548
We can brag about them.

673
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,190
Further right.

674
00:39:57,595 --> 00:40:00,621
That's it, that's it.

675
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:02,491
All right.

676
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:06,466
Shoot over here, over here!

677
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:10,131
What's that maestro doing?

678
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,903
He's never been on time.

679
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:14,908
He's no good, no good.

680
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:16,843
He's got lots of other work.

681
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:18,744
Here he is, he's here.

682
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:23,146
Can you get a table?

683
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,243
Right.

684
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:29,556
What the hell time
does he think it is?

685
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:35,293
The measurement here? Maestro?

686
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:36,727
It's there.

687
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:38,165
What's this "7" here?

688
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,531
7 inches.

689
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:41,494
Inches?

690
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:46,935
I've never built a house in inches.

691
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:49,740
Precisely the problem
with Japanese architecture.

692
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:50,814
C'mere.

693
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:55,915
The design's Western, but cut to
Japanese sizes, so it's miniaturized.

694
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:59,820
All wood here s cut
to Japanese measurements.

695
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:05,419
So if you re-cut in inches,
it's a lot of extra work.

696
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:08,726
Sure it's extra work,
but I say it's essential.

697
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:09,822
I know!

698
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:12,402
Who do you think you are?

699
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:14,601
Can't you use inches?

700
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:17,704
It comes down to money.

701
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,537
Inches cost more?

702
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:20,974
It's not economical.

703
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:25,139
If you cut a 30 inch plank
from a standard Japanese board,

704
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:27,410
you waste this much.

705
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:29,145
I see...

706
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:32,252
I can't!

707
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:36,524
Build a house in inches, dammit!

708
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:39,390
Slr.

709
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,658
Let's use the Japanese way.

710
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:52,299
Chief!

711
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:53,273
Yeah!

712
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:56,938
Gotta bury the well. Need you here!

713
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:58,207
Be right there.

714
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:02,885
And off I go...

715
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:12,694
Yagida san.

716
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:20,730
The wrong prayer...

717
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,908
You're really good to your father.

718
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:35,247
But all these disagreements.

719
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:38,344
Don't worry,
you can count on your Dad.

720
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:42,450
Here.

721
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:46,925
The wrong prayer...

722
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:50,125
We used to call a real priest.

723
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,223
The pipe?

724
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:54,600
So the water god can breathe.

725
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:56,002
Wow, that's neat.

726
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:58,506
OK, cover it with earth.

727
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:08,915
Tamiko, you look more and more
like your mother.

728
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:12,182
Is that supposed to make me happy?

729
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:16,153
Oh, no, no, no... Are you OK?

730
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:21,898
Building a house at your age
is something to be proud of.

731
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:24,257
We took a 30 year mortgage.

732
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:27,997
But these days, the banks

733
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,835
don't like to lend money.

734
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:33,933
You have real credibility with them.

735
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:35,909
Impressive.

736
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,341
Naosuke, Naosuke.

737
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,384
Yes, Father. Excuse me.

738
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:47,920
Tamiko, Tamiko, he's my son.

739
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:50,585
He's your son?

740
00:43:50,694 --> 00:43:54,027
I'm bringing hlm on this job.

741
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:56,463
Nice to meet you.

742
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:57,997
Where you goin'!

743
00:43:58,102 --> 00:43:59,433
The W.C.

744
00:43:59,536 --> 00:44:01,299
Not again.

745
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,775
About the maestro.

746
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:10,106
I hate to tell you.
He may be Mr. Modernism and all,

747
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:15,208
but he's a friggin' amateur
when it comes to construction, trust me.

748
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:17,452
At this rate,

749
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:21,320
you're never gonna
have a house, Naosuke.

750
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:23,157
So,

751
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:28,630
sorry for the maestro, but
I had Suga draw some other plans.

752
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:30,128
Show him.

753
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:35,564
Won't you take it home and

754
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:38,800
look it over with Tamiko?

755
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:40,571
Please.

756
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:44,345
- What are you doing?
- Back already?

757
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,287
- What's this?
- No good?

758
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:59,190
Of course not!
The 1st floor's all tatami rooms!

759
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:01,389
It's not a houseboat, you know.

760
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:06,131
Why'd you even bring it home?

761
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:10,970
This is getting super complicated.

762
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:13,533
This house'll be great.

763
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:16,442
Nicely curving storybook veranda.

764
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,913
Very storybook.

765
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:22,448
Go ahead and apply for permits
early next week.

766
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:25,147
And the Ground-Breaking Ceremony?

767
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:27,246
It's Tamlko for you.

768
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:32,960
Sometime this month.
You work it out, OK?

769
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:34,496
My pleasure.

770
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,860
Yeah.

771
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:41,971
I want to build this house.

772
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:45,539
Listen, I hired Yanagisawa.

773
00:45:45,642 --> 00:45:48,406
You can't just do
whatever you please!

774
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:51,242
This house belongs to me and Naosuke.

775
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:53,873
You just work for us.

776
00:45:54,718 --> 00:45:58,518
If you can't listen to your client,
then we'll just have to...

777
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,989
Hire another contractor.

778
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:17,668
Party's over. Go home.

779
00:46:29,853 --> 00:46:31,980
Tamiko always was...

780
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:35,115
What?

781
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:37,757
She always was headstrong.

782
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:40,654
What's that about?

783
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:44,798
She always did everything
her own way.

784
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:48,400
Always independent.

785
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,800
Come to think of it,

786
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:56,240
this is the first time
she's asked me for anything.

787
00:46:57,381 --> 00:46:58,643
Really?

788
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:02,751
And I haven't done,

789
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:07,547
a single thing to make her happy...

790
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:15,021
Now that my daughter finally
comes to me for help.

791
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:29,509
Oh, no...

792
00:47:31,815 --> 00:47:33,874
No more toenails left.

793
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:45,556
Suga? It's me.

794
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:50,122
I'm awful sorry,
but about those permits.

795
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:54,933
Can you hold off a little?
I'm really sorry.

796
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:01,343
Houses resemble the people
who build them - Italian proverb

797
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:03,936
- Mind your manners!
- Okay.

798
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:06,377
Come over here.

799
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,878
How's the house coming?

800
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:10,351
Moving along.

801
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:15,151
I've never built my own home.
Is it as hard as they say?

802
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:18,327
Lots of twists and turns, I'd say.

803
00:48:18,495 --> 00:48:20,622
Twists?

804
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:21,887
Meat's burning.

805
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:25,660
I told you not to play
with your food.

806
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:29,431
How're things... with the maestro?

807
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:30,870
No news from him?

808
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:33,636
You have to eat your food.

809
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:36,545
Come to Grandpa, Sweetie.

810
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:38,638
No word, recently?

811
00:48:39,549 --> 00:48:42,541
Not a peep since then.

812
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,618
I'm sure he's hard at work.

813
00:48:44,888 --> 00:48:47,755
- Who? Who?
- It's none of your business.

814
00:48:47,858 --> 00:48:49,758
The designer we hired.

815
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:52,294
- There a problem?
- It's no big deal.

816
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:55,559
But originally, you'd planned
to be building by now.

817
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:58,692
And you aren't,
which means there's a problem.

818
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:00,599
Cut it out.

819
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:03,068
You know, I've got

820
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:06,874
my whole crew on hold.

821
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:08,205
Oh, really?

822
00:49:08,478 --> 00:49:12,744
Better put 'em to work soon
or they'll all starve to death.

823
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:17,179
Your grandfather is not a toyl

824
00:49:17,554 --> 00:49:18,782
Come over here.

825
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:20,481
Are the plans delayed?

826
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:23,251
Come, let's all eat.

827
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:25,690
How are all the old guys?

828
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:26,820
They're fine.

829
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:29,296
You've got your hands full, Father.

830
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:33,893
I'm fine, but the guys
I have standing by...

831
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:36,671
What is it?

832
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:40,766
But that's terrible.
That's the worst.

833
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:44,238
When you have a chance,
check on Yanagisawa?

834
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:46,849
- Check?
- On the designer.

835
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,576
- Don't bother.
- Yanagisawa?

836
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:50,983
- Not so loud.
- Just ignore him.

837
00:49:51,088 --> 00:49:53,522
Thank God, we're renters.

838
00:49:53,623 --> 00:49:58,083
Recklessly build a house,
it's just a pile of worries.

839
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:00,523
OK, time to eat.

840
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:08,264
The chief's crew is waiting.

841
00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:10,866
My phllosophy is...

842
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:14,733
first an artist, second a craftsman.

843
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:18,843
Of course, you have to work to eat.

844
00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:23,215
But I can't afford to
squander my talent.

845
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:26,717
Here's what I think.

846
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:31,925
The moment the artist bends
his principles, he's lost his art.

847
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:36,631
When the chief sald
he couldn't build to inches,

848
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,234
frankly, my interest sank.

849
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:44,473
But I'm a blg boy. Having taken
the job, I'll see it through.

850
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:48,235
But not as an artist.

851
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:51,914
From now on,
it's just another job to me.

852
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:54,040
Then meet your deadline!

853
00:50:58,021 --> 00:51:00,182
Isn't that what work's about?

854
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:03,757
I sensed your passion so we waited.

855
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:08,428
But if that's your position,
then we'll reconsider ours.

856
00:51:09,766 --> 00:51:14,135
You've got 'til the end of this week.
Otherwise, we'll find someone else.

857
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:20,799
I'm... a creative person too.

858
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:25,110
I can understand how you feel.
But you're wrong.

859
00:51:25,982 --> 00:51:28,712
The artlst and the craftsman
don't conflict.

860
00:51:29,486 --> 00:51:33,149
Without passion, a craftsman
might as well be a machine.

861
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:36,922
And an artlst who can't sell his work,
is just a weirdo.

862
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:43,928
It's a question of
where you compromise.

863
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:47,931
If you want to consider this
just a job, that's fine.

864
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:51,402
But I don't want to sacrlfice
your artistic passion,

865
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:53,935
and it's not that difficult.

866
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,976
Here's what I want, OK?

867
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:02,240
Yes.

868
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:06,050
That you finish the work
as an artist,

869
00:52:06,423 --> 00:52:09,221
by the end of the week,
like a craftsman.

870
00:52:11,528 --> 00:52:13,189
On one condition.

871
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,903
The front door opens in.

872
00:52:22,439 --> 00:52:24,430
On that, I will not budge.

873
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:32,945
Ground-Breaking Ceremony

874
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:18,852
I hereby undertake

875
00:53:18,962 --> 00:53:22,454
the ritual purification of this land.

876
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:47,746
Thanks for everything.
I think it'll be a lovely house.

877
00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:52,926
- Hey, what are they up to?
- Purifying the land.

878
00:53:53,029 --> 00:53:55,554
- What are they throwing?
- Rice, salt and paper.

879
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:57,394
Are they going to clean it up?

880
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,292
Um, excuse me.

881
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:03,339
Here.

882
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:04,874
Huh?

883
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:08,069
See that bamboo branch?

884
00:54:08,445 --> 00:54:10,777
Dig under it with this.

885
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:11,744
Dig?

886
00:54:11,848 --> 00:54:13,873
It's part of the ritual.

887
00:54:14,184 --> 00:54:16,584
You go, " Heave, ho.'' Twice, please.

888
00:54:16,786 --> 00:54:17,946
Be serious about it.

889
00:54:18,054 --> 00:54:19,316
You, too, Tamiko.

890
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:20,650
Me, too?

891
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:22,554
Both of you, please.

892
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:35,364
Please proceed.

893
00:54:37,073 --> 00:54:38,301
Here goes!

894
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:43,841
Ready, heave, ho.

895
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:23,748
Architect, the honorable Yanagisawa.

896
00:55:26,556 --> 00:55:28,114
Your turn, maestro.

897
00:55:28,224 --> 00:55:29,452
No, I...

898
00:55:29,626 --> 00:55:30,820
Please.

899
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:48,604
Ciao.

900
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:53,539
- What the hell!
- The jerk!

901
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:57,016
Over, over, OK.

902
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,212
Jr .!

903
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:01,183
That's the last one, chief.

904
00:56:01,758 --> 00:56:03,953
That's it.

905
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:30,376
It's no use, I'm blocked.
Can I go home and think it over?

906
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:32,921
They're starting to panic on set.

907
00:56:34,991 --> 00:56:39,394
We should really stop wringing laughs
out of those monster suits.

908
00:56:39,629 --> 00:56:41,460
How's the house coming?

909
00:56:42,298 --> 00:56:45,392
I have my troubles
in that department, too.

910
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:46,862
Send the e-mail.

911
00:57:00,316 --> 00:57:04,150
My juices stop flowing
when there's water north of me.

912
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:05,915
Could you move?

913
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:11,386
Got yourself some great pillars.

914
00:57:11,494 --> 00:57:12,483
Yeah.

915
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:15,765
It'll be one sturdy house.

916
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,927
Be hard put to find a house
these days,

917
00:57:21,037 --> 00:57:23,301
built of this quality lumber.

918
00:57:23,406 --> 00:57:26,705
Just like you, chief,
giving it your best.

919
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:31,939
Should be ready for the Roof-Laying
Ceremony later this week.

920
00:57:32,649 --> 00:57:35,550
Can't wait for the Japanese room.

921
00:57:38,488 --> 00:57:40,979
Just between you and me.

922
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:42,148
Yes.

923
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:49,190
The plans call for 6 tatami mats,

924
00:57:50,433 --> 00:57:54,631
but I gave myself
permission to make it 20.

925
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:59,974
Won't you get in trouble?
The maestro'll flip out.

926
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:03,838
The Japanese room's mine
to design as I like.

927
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:09,411
I gave in on paper, but hey,
we're the ones building it.

928
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:16,419
Roof-Laying Ceremony

929
00:58:16,526 --> 00:58:18,016
What ceremony?

930
00:58:18,261 --> 00:58:21,992
There's all kinds of ceremonies.
At the Roof-Laying,

931
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:27,192
you drink sake, show gratitude for all
their work, and pray for a good house.

932
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,737
But we just prayed the other day.

933
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:32,334
That was the Ground-Breaking.

934
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:36,811
We prayed to the gods to
protect our land, totally different.

935
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:40,243
You aren't a builder's daughter
for nothing.

936
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:43,378
He wants you to make a speech.

937
00:58:44,387 --> 00:58:46,514
Me? A speech?

938
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:48,318
I hope Yanagisawa shows.

939
00:58:48,558 --> 00:58:49,650
About what?

940
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:51,624
What a drag.

941
00:58:52,095 --> 00:58:55,758
I sure hope they'll all listen.

942
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:59,491
I don't want a repeat of
that party at Mom's.

943
00:58:59,669 --> 00:59:01,000
That was hopeless.

944
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:05,404
Of course they all watched
the Filipino dancer next to you.

945
00:59:05,575 --> 00:59:09,011
That was the worst speech.

946
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,345
How many people?

947
00:59:13,449 --> 00:59:15,110
Probably a dozen.

948
00:59:17,654 --> 00:59:19,849
Will they have a microphone?

949
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:32,396
Once more.

950
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,295
Once more.

951
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:44,608
You're in the way.

952
00:59:45,782 --> 00:59:47,545
We'll be late, Mom.

953
00:59:48,184 --> 00:59:49,276
Don't worry.

954
01:00:14,677 --> 01:00:16,042
All done!

955
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:19,339
Bravo, chief!

956
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:21,417
You're the best!

957
01:00:34,697 --> 01:00:36,255
Hey, hey!

958
01:00:36,366 --> 01:00:37,128
What?

959
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:39,064
What are these guys doing here?

960
01:00:39,168 --> 01:00:42,934
You said a dozen.
I've never seen half these guys.

961
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:48,376
It's the best being
on a job with you.

962
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,036
Thanks.

963
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:53,946
Time to toast your labors, chief.

964
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:55,574
Let me pour you one.

965
01:00:55,685 --> 01:00:57,778
Drink up.

966
01:00:59,122 --> 01:01:03,525
That's the way.
You're a good looking man, chief.

967
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:07,528
Don't egg him on too much.
It'll go to his head.

968
01:01:07,864 --> 01:01:10,389
Mother, look.

969
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:14,133
Oh, here you are.

970
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:15,463
It's so far away.

971
01:01:15,571 --> 01:01:16,936
Yes, it is, whatever.

972
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:18,267
What is it?

973
01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:21,434
Well, I know it's a little early,

974
01:01:21,544 --> 01:01:25,275
but you're making a pond, so
I thought you could use a statue.

975
01:01:25,381 --> 01:01:30,250
This, is my...
house-warming present.

976
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:35,623
It's a Mannequin Pis, supposed
to be good luck in Belgium.

977
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:41,190
I never heard about a pond!
What the hell is this!

978
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:42,924
What's this about a pond here!

979
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:47,662
Naosuke, didn't you tell your mother
we gave up on the pond?

980
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:49,294
There's no pond here.

981
01:01:49,405 --> 01:01:51,168
Is there a microphone?

982
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:54,676
Hello.

983
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:58,846
I came for his speech.

984
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:03,451
Thank you, the ceremony's over
and the party's heating up.

985
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:05,714
Please, take a look inside.

986
01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:07,756
Where's the pond going...

987
01:02:08,191 --> 01:02:10,421
The pond, in the south.

988
01:02:10,526 --> 01:02:13,723
I'm sure it's over there.

989
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:15,592
Just put it over there for now.

990
01:02:15,698 --> 01:02:18,132
What pond is she talking about?

991
01:02:22,772 --> 01:02:24,706
Everybody drinking?

992
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:33,615
Thank God it didn't snow, chief.

993
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:36,042
Is there a micro...

994
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:38,619
Oh, a microphone...?

995
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:43,292
Do you have a minute?

996
01:02:43,726 --> 01:02:48,095
I just noticed, do you mind?
That's the Japanese room, right?

997
01:02:48,197 --> 01:02:49,255
Yes.

998
01:02:49,365 --> 01:02:53,028
It feels too big,
it's only supposed to be 6 mats.

999
01:02:54,871 --> 01:02:58,398
It's not right. Hey, chief.

1000
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:01,876
How many mats did
you end up going with?

1001
01:03:01,978 --> 01:03:03,377
How many what?

1002
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:05,276
In the Japanese room.

1003
01:03:05,381 --> 01:03:09,374
The Japanese room has 6 mats,
of course.

1004
01:03:09,485 --> 01:03:11,316
Right, Suga?

1005
01:03:12,355 --> 01:03:15,847
It doesn't make sense.

1006
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:21,362
Weren't you told?
The chief ordered a 20 mat room.

1007
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:23,455
That huge?

1008
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,758
Since when?

1009
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:27,667
No turning back?

1010
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:30,762
The structure's already up.

1011
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:35,975
I'm so sorry.

1012
01:03:36,078 --> 01:03:38,808
I'm fine, but what about you?

1013
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:41,946
I guess I don't have a choice.

1014
01:03:43,786 --> 01:03:48,746
Hey, folks, time for the man of
the house to say a few words.

1015
01:03:49,025 --> 01:03:51,255
Quiet down.

1016
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,994
Here we go.

1017
01:03:56,632 --> 01:03:59,396
The word "house"...

1018
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:00,526
What's that?

1019
01:04:00,636 --> 01:04:02,729
There they are!

1020
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:06,002
You're late,
hurry up and get ready!

1021
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:11,309
Folks, these are dancers
from my club.

1022
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:15,281
A celebration dance...

1023
01:04:16,919 --> 01:04:18,352
Yanagisawa...

1024
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:27,156
Oh, what the hell.
Who gives a damn!

1025
01:04:27,296 --> 01:04:30,163
Only you guys know how I feel!

1026
01:04:38,574 --> 01:04:42,203
Even the Arch of Triumph was built by
an architect and a builder - A builder

1027
01:04:42,311 --> 01:04:44,211
And the interior?
Chosen wall colors yet?

1028
01:04:44,313 --> 01:04:48,841
I'm slck of waiting for him,
so he's coming to the site,

1029
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:50,746
making decisions on the spot.

1030
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:52,851
That must be tough.

1031
01:04:52,955 --> 01:04:54,752
The Japanese room?

1032
01:04:54,857 --> 01:04:56,586
It's working out just fine.

1033
01:04:56,692 --> 01:05:01,026
How wonderful, Dad,
your dream came true.

1034
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:02,961
You're good to your father.

1035
01:05:03,432 --> 01:05:05,229
What will it look like?

1036
01:05:07,136 --> 01:05:09,900
I want to go with juraku.

1037
01:05:10,206 --> 01:05:11,503
Juraku?

1038
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:13,842
What's juraku?

1039
01:05:13,943 --> 01:05:15,570
Never heard of it.

1040
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:21,410
It's kind of rare these days.
I'll show you when it's done.

1041
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:23,984
Makes me so nervous!

1042
01:05:24,153 --> 01:05:26,018
I bet it'll be a real problem.

1043
01:05:26,122 --> 01:05:27,953
You shut up!

1044
01:05:29,025 --> 01:05:31,323
I recommend this one.

1045
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:35,920
I think it looks great.

1046
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:37,893
Maestro?

1047
01:05:38,367 --> 01:05:41,803
No fluorescent lights.
Incandescents in the study.

1048
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,701
This one, please.

1049
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:47,802
I want the study to be austere.

1050
01:05:50,313 --> 01:05:56,252
Maestro, uneducated as I am,
I can't make this out, Chew...

1051
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:58,943
Two, Too...

1052
01:05:59,155 --> 01:06:03,114
Tudor style, it's what
Frank Lloyd Wright preferred.

1053
01:06:05,528 --> 01:06:06,654
Don't know him.

1054
01:06:06,762 --> 01:06:09,390
You don't have to. Just order it.

1055
01:06:10,232 --> 01:06:11,631
Impossible.

1056
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:13,599
Why not?

1057
01:06:13,703 --> 01:06:17,537
No time.
If we order it now, it's too late.

1058
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,801
It's your job to
get it here on time.

1059
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:24,209
If the maestro had made up his mind,
he could have anything.

1060
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:28,340
Sorry, but you pick
from what's available.

1061
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:30,710
Cut the bullshit and
pick one of these!

1062
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:32,310
There's nothing here!

1063
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:34,787
Let's order this one. Make a note.

1064
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:36,448
I'm the designer!

1065
01:06:38,761 --> 01:06:40,490
I'm the contractor.

1066
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:46,666
It's my job to finish the house
on time, maestro.

1067
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:49,028
We use this one in the study.

1068
01:06:49,138 --> 01:06:53,734
A-45?

1069
01:06:55,378 --> 01:06:58,006
Now he's pissed.

1070
01:06:58,114 --> 01:07:02,278
Let him order you around,
it'll never get built, right?

1071
01:07:02,385 --> 01:07:03,545
Right.

1072
01:07:06,756 --> 01:07:08,485
The door won't open!

1073
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:10,786
Pull it towards you.

1074
01:07:11,127 --> 01:07:14,028
Most doors open out.

1075
01:07:23,572 --> 01:07:25,096
Bye, teacher.

1076
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:27,402
Bye.

1077
01:07:46,862 --> 01:07:47,988
Hello.

1078
01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:48,995
Hello.

1079
01:07:49,098 --> 01:07:51,191
Great to see you, Tamiko.

1080
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:54,131
It's coming along.

1081
01:07:55,271 --> 01:07:58,172
I brought you some snacks.

1082
01:07:58,641 --> 01:07:59,733
And now?

1083
01:07:59,842 --> 01:08:02,834
He's choosing colors
for the living room.

1084
01:08:02,945 --> 01:08:04,674
White walls are so great.

1085
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:06,270
Ivory, not white.

1086
01:08:06,382 --> 01:08:10,079
To our way of thinking,
it's not a color we'd use.

1087
01:08:10,186 --> 01:08:13,952
White shows dirt,
so most people avoid it.

1088
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:18,986
People use it and it shows wear.
That's what we call lived-in.

1089
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:21,325
Sounds far-fetched to me.

1090
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:24,957
People don't paint these days,
they use cloth.

1091
01:08:25,067 --> 01:08:25,999
Cloth?

1092
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:27,467
Wallpaper.

1093
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:30,835
But these days,
they've got great wallpaper.

1094
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:33,431
Don't have to bother with paint.

1095
01:08:34,743 --> 01:08:39,771
I'd like a muted version,

1096
01:08:40,316 --> 01:08:41,647
of this chip.

1097
01:08:41,851 --> 01:08:44,684
That's a custom color.

1098
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:46,152
Well then, make it.

1099
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:54,086
Fine, then,
it's a good color, done.

1100
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:56,022
Done, next.

1101
01:08:57,266 --> 01:08:59,234
That's 726-3.

1102
01:08:59,668 --> 01:09:00,965
It's always llke this.

1103
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:02,162
I feel bad.

1104
01:09:02,271 --> 01:09:04,466
My job is to compromise.

1105
01:09:04,573 --> 01:09:05,767
Maestro.

1106
01:09:06,342 --> 01:09:08,367
It'll be a great house.

1107
01:09:09,178 --> 01:09:10,668
Sorry, move over.

1108
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:13,405
Maestro, about the bathroom tiles.

1109
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:15,775
These are the only ones available.

1110
01:09:15,885 --> 01:09:17,045
Fine, you choose.

1111
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:18,415
Oh, please.

1112
01:09:18,521 --> 01:09:22,981
Go ahead, the maestro says
it's up to you, so let's decide.

1113
01:09:23,792 --> 01:09:28,195
But the corners need to be,
what's it called, exactly?

1114
01:09:28,297 --> 01:09:30,788
The rounded corner that curves.

1115
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:32,162
What's that?

1116
01:09:32,268 --> 01:09:33,257
What's up, chief?

1117
01:09:33,369 --> 01:09:37,829
Don't you know? The corner piece
has an oriental feel.

1118
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:41,100
You better start making some sense.

1119
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:43,776
Just wait a minute.

1120
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:48,873
Now what?

1121
01:09:53,088 --> 01:09:57,218
If it's too specialized,
it'll take time to find.

1122
01:09:58,227 --> 01:10:03,096
You know the kind of tile I mean.

1123
01:10:05,134 --> 01:10:09,070
What the hell is that?
What the hell.

1124
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:13,135
Go with what we've got.

1125
01:10:13,275 --> 01:10:14,742
Dad.

1126
01:10:15,344 --> 01:10:18,313
There's no time, c'mon, OK?

1127
01:10:18,948 --> 01:10:22,145
What exactly am I doing here?
Tell me!

1128
01:10:22,251 --> 01:10:25,414
This one and that one.

1129
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:30,082
What is this pillar doing here!

1130
01:10:30,359 --> 01:10:33,351
The central pillar's
the heart of a house!

1131
01:11:38,327 --> 01:11:42,161
Ultimately, your Dad and
Yanagisawa are the same.

1132
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:45,790
They're both craftsman,
who believe in themselves.

1133
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:48,563
That's why they butt heads.

1134
01:11:48,671 --> 01:11:50,434
Maybe you're right.

1135
01:11:50,539 --> 01:11:54,134
If you ask me,
they're twins separated at birth.

1136
01:11:58,013 --> 01:12:00,914
He's useless.

1137
01:12:01,583 --> 01:12:06,020
What's his thing? He ask for stuff
we don't have on purpose?

1138
01:12:06,121 --> 01:12:08,112
Not necessarily.

1139
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:13,159
All that fancy crap
and always in English, too.

1140
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:17,756
Well, I don't like it.
We got lots of good stuff in Japan.

1141
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:20,894
Chief, this...

1142
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:24,935
This might just be "bamboo-tile."

1143
01:12:30,813 --> 01:12:32,075
What's bamboo-tile?

1144
01:12:32,381 --> 01:12:36,875
In old houses,
they usually used this tile

1145
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:40,121
in bathroom corners.

1146
01:12:40,255 --> 01:12:42,519
Hardly see it, these days.

1147
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,887
I'm impressed
the maestro knew about it.

1148
01:12:49,798 --> 01:12:51,288
Just might be, chief,

1149
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:57,169
that he's the one stuck on
doing things the old way.

1150
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:06,773
Wow, this tile brings back memories,
are you using it?

1151
01:13:20,929 --> 01:13:22,726
It's coming along.

1152
01:13:23,265 --> 01:13:26,234
White walls aren't bad,
are they, chief?

1153
01:13:27,336 --> 01:13:28,667
Not bad...

1154
01:13:28,771 --> 01:13:33,105
We're so used to wallpaper,
it'd never occur to us.

1155
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:35,006
Father.

1156
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:38,204
Chief, they need you
to check the juraku.

1157
01:13:38,313 --> 01:13:39,507
Right.

1158
01:13:40,949 --> 01:13:42,007
Here goes.

1159
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:48,682
The chief seems to llke it.

1160
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:51,259
I was aiming for
a more muted shade.

1161
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,521
I think it's neat the way it is.

1162
01:13:53,662 --> 01:13:57,428
This house is riddled with
compromises, everywhere.

1163
01:14:02,771 --> 01:14:04,466
I'll check out the Japanese room.

1164
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:16,773
How is it?

1165
01:14:16,885 --> 01:14:18,978
It's uneven there.

1166
01:14:19,254 --> 01:14:20,516
Here?

1167
01:14:21,757 --> 01:14:25,284
Look, Naosuke.
That's what we call juraku.

1168
01:14:26,028 --> 01:14:28,929
It erases the boundary
between ceiling and wall.

1169
01:14:29,031 --> 01:14:33,991
That's how our ancestors expressed
the vastness of the universe.

1170
01:14:34,203 --> 01:14:36,034
Wow, I see.

1171
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:39,173
Father, do you mind?

1172
01:14:42,077 --> 01:14:45,103
Yanagisawa seems kind of depressed.

1173
01:14:47,115 --> 01:14:51,347
If I recall, he specializes in...

1174
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:54,018
He's an interior designer.

1175
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:59,820
Where can I see a place he created?

1176
01:15:03,765 --> 01:15:07,496
I figure it can't
hurt to take a look...

1177
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:19,304
Seriously?

1178
01:15:19,982 --> 01:15:24,510
OK, then I'll work in something
on the Mecha-mermaid theme.

1179
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:27,880
Right, right, right, I understand.

1180
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:34,594
What would you like?
Anything you don't eat?

1181
01:15:34,897 --> 01:15:38,025
Father, why are you so tense?

1182
01:15:38,467 --> 01:15:41,163
It's my first time
in such a fancy joint.

1183
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:44,899
Yanagisawa designed this place.

1184
01:15:45,107 --> 01:15:46,335
He did?

1185
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:49,310
Seems to be pretty popular.

1186
01:15:50,145 --> 01:15:52,010
It's really elegant, isn't it?

1187
01:15:52,114 --> 01:15:53,604
This table, too...

1188
01:15:54,249 --> 01:15:55,079
I see.

1189
01:15:55,183 --> 01:15:57,777
That's what designers do, after all.

1190
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:03,213
It's really well made,
and sturdy, too.

1191
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:06,987
The chief wanted to see
a place that you designed.

1192
01:16:09,498 --> 01:16:11,125
What would you like?

1193
01:16:15,504 --> 01:16:17,165
Oh, excuse me.

1194
01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:21,405
Oh, I finally
spoke to him about that.

1195
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:23,034
Yes, that's right...

1196
01:16:24,513 --> 01:16:27,141
What's the specialty of the house?

1197
01:16:27,482 --> 01:16:28,881
Everything's good.

1198
01:16:29,017 --> 01:16:30,006
You order.

1199
01:16:30,152 --> 01:16:31,278
Not for me.

1200
01:16:31,386 --> 01:16:32,284
Not eating?

1201
01:16:32,387 --> 01:16:33,547
Not at night.

1202
01:16:34,156 --> 01:16:37,387
You need three square meals a day...

1203
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:39,185
If you want to live a long life.

1204
01:16:39,294 --> 01:16:41,558
I don't especially want to.

1205
01:16:42,564 --> 01:16:44,657
That's what all young guys say.

1206
01:16:46,568 --> 01:16:48,263
Oh, right...

1207
01:16:55,811 --> 01:16:59,303
This what you had in mind, maestro?

1208
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:03,450
It's called " bamboo-t le."

1209
01:17:04,886 --> 01:17:07,514
Scoured every tile dealer in Tokyo.

1210
01:17:07,656 --> 01:17:10,921
Finally found some
squirreled away in storage.

1211
01:17:15,697 --> 01:17:17,892
I'm impressed you knew.

1212
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,026
I remember seeing it as a kid.

1213
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:25,204
I'm startin' to get the plcture.

1214
01:17:25,574 --> 01:17:29,510
Boils down to...
you like old stuff, right?

1215
01:17:29,745 --> 01:17:31,542
Nailed you, rlght?

1216
01:17:33,181 --> 01:17:36,514
Whenever we show you
new catalogues,

1217
01:17:37,686 --> 01:17:40,917
you always turn 'em down.

1218
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:45,250
It's easy to find
cheap and convenient things.

1219
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,692
So, everything ends up
being predictable.

1220
01:17:47,863 --> 01:17:53,267
Predictable lives, predictable homes.
I can't stand them.

1221
01:17:54,603 --> 01:17:57,766
What I'm looking for
isn't so special.

1222
01:17:58,373 --> 01:18:00,307
I just want the basics.

1223
01:18:00,409 --> 01:18:04,436
There aren't enough of the basics
in this country.

1224
01:18:06,581 --> 01:18:09,641
Is convenience so wonderful?

1225
01:18:10,218 --> 01:18:14,052
Is spending time and effort
really a waste?

1226
01:18:15,557 --> 01:18:16,683
You order?

1227
01:18:18,727 --> 01:18:20,092
What's that?

1228
01:18:20,195 --> 01:18:21,685
The kind I told you about.

1229
01:18:21,797 --> 01:18:23,162
Wow.

1230
01:18:23,298 --> 01:18:24,822
The chief managed to find it.

1231
01:18:24,933 --> 01:18:27,868
Really? Is that true?

1232
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:29,928
So, you'll use it?

1233
01:18:30,072 --> 01:18:32,006
It costs a little more,

1234
01:18:32,107 --> 01:18:34,803
but my son-in-law will
have to live with that.

1235
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:38,778
Guess I'll have to.
C'mon, let's order.

1236
01:18:39,481 --> 01:18:42,143
Something salty, salty.

1237
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:47,819
All of these are salty.

1238
01:18:49,858 --> 01:18:52,190
This salmon carpaccia.

1239
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:53,850
Carpacci O.

1240
01:18:55,163 --> 01:18:56,858
Carpacci A.

1241
01:18:57,199 --> 01:19:01,659
Oh, that's great.
Dad's got his sweet side, too.

1242
01:19:03,805 --> 01:19:05,329
What's wrong?

1243
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:08,532
What's got you down?

1244
01:19:22,924 --> 01:19:25,154
Looks delicious.

1245
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:28,120
Is that special salt?

1246
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:30,926
No, people prize
Mediterranean salt,

1247
01:19:31,032 --> 01:19:34,126
but I don't think it works.
I use Japanese salt.

1248
01:19:34,469 --> 01:19:36,300
Mighty particular.

1249
01:19:36,505 --> 01:19:37,870
Cheers.

1250
01:19:39,307 --> 01:19:42,174
I'll mix a new one.

1251
01:19:42,677 --> 01:19:44,542
I used too much salt.

1252
01:19:44,646 --> 01:19:45,943
But why!

1253
01:19:46,047 --> 01:19:47,605
It's my fault.

1254
01:19:47,716 --> 01:19:49,581
A real pro.

1255
01:19:50,385 --> 01:19:52,512
I'm only paying for one.

1256
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:53,713
Of course.

1257
01:19:56,558 --> 01:19:57,616
No good.

1258
01:19:58,160 --> 01:19:59,684
Hurry up.

1259
01:19:59,861 --> 01:20:01,294
It's my problem.

1260
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:03,124
A real pro.

1261
01:20:06,535 --> 01:20:07,661
No good.

1262
01:20:08,103 --> 01:20:09,695
What's no good?

1263
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:12,470
It's my problem.

1264
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,040
No good.

1265
01:20:30,458 --> 01:20:32,551
It's my problem.

1266
01:21:01,289 --> 01:21:02,688
What is this?

1267
01:21:03,091 --> 01:21:06,390
Somebody got in last night.

1268
01:21:06,494 --> 01:21:07,518
Goddammit!

1269
01:21:07,629 --> 01:21:08,425
But, who?

1270
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:10,794
The door was locked.

1271
01:21:10,999 --> 01:21:14,093
The windows weren't tampered with.

1272
01:21:14,202 --> 01:21:18,434
In other words,
it was someone who had a key.

1273
01:21:31,386 --> 01:21:33,081
Color's looking good.

1274
01:21:34,789 --> 01:21:38,657
You, you did this!

1275
01:21:40,495 --> 01:21:42,087
You asshole!

1276
01:21:47,669 --> 01:21:52,504
I don't give a damn
whether you like it or not.

1277
01:21:52,807 --> 01:21:57,141
But once we decide something,

1278
01:21:57,812 --> 01:22:01,179
you've got to live with it.
In this world,

1279
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:07,183
you rarely get your own way.
And if you don't like it,

1280
01:22:08,290 --> 01:22:12,124
stay at home and paint pictures!

1281
01:22:15,997 --> 01:22:18,932
If you're going to get
in my way, get lost!

1282
01:22:19,234 --> 01:22:22,397
Don't you ever show
your face here again!

1283
01:22:31,146 --> 01:22:35,776
Rain's good for a house under
construction: helps it to grow roots

1284
01:22:35,884 --> 01:22:38,444
- a wise builder

1285
01:22:44,826 --> 01:22:46,316
It's really raining.

1286
01:22:46,561 --> 01:22:48,961
They announced a storm warning.

1287
01:22:49,064 --> 01:22:52,864
I hope our house is OK.
Think it's covered well?

1288
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:00,403
I'm stepping out.

1289
01:23:06,781 --> 01:23:09,545
Hi, Mom, is Dad there?

1290
01:23:09,651 --> 01:23:12,245
He went over
to check on the house.

1291
01:23:12,354 --> 01:23:13,844
What did he say?

1292
01:23:14,155 --> 01:23:17,716
He thought it'd be fine.
Just wanted to make sure.

1293
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:20,989
OK, thanks, bye, bye.

1294
01:23:22,731 --> 01:23:27,293
My Dad went to check.
Says it should be fine...

1295
01:23:27,502 --> 01:23:29,732
Try his cell phone.

1296
01:23:39,614 --> 01:23:42,276
...you are calling
is out of range...

1297
01:23:42,517 --> 01:23:43,711
No answer.

1298
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:45,782
Must be driving.

1299
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:45,376
I was in the neighborhood.

1300
01:24:55,690 --> 01:24:58,158
I checked the 2nd floor.

1301
01:24:58,393 --> 01:25:00,224
I'll check the bedroom.

1302
01:25:07,502 --> 01:25:08,594
It's ringing!

1303
01:25:09,437 --> 01:25:11,803
Oh, hello, Dad? Where are you?

1304
01:25:12,373 --> 01:25:16,537
I built you a sturdy house, after all.
This little bit of rain's nothing.

1305
01:25:16,744 --> 01:25:18,006
Don't you worry.

1306
01:25:18,413 --> 01:25:21,280
Oh, thank goodness.

1307
01:25:22,817 --> 01:25:25,445
What! Yanagisawa's there, too?

1308
01:25:26,387 --> 01:25:28,685
Yanagisawa? Why?

1309
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:30,189
What's he doing there?

1310
01:25:30,525 --> 01:25:33,392
Fixing me a cup of tea.

1311
01:25:34,028 --> 01:25:37,555
We both just ended up here.

1312
01:25:37,799 --> 01:25:39,061
How lovely.

1313
01:25:39,167 --> 01:25:40,498
What are they up to?

1314
01:25:40,602 --> 01:25:43,867
Apparently he was worried, too.
Got a soft side, too.

1315
01:25:44,205 --> 01:25:45,695
Let me talk to him.

1316
01:25:46,574 --> 01:25:49,702
Hello, what are you up to?

1317
01:25:50,879 --> 01:25:53,871
Thank you.

1318
01:25:54,349 --> 01:25:58,479
Really, both of you?

1319
01:25:58,786 --> 01:26:00,219
Why are you going?

1320
01:26:00,321 --> 01:26:01,618
'Cause, I'm worried.

1321
01:26:01,723 --> 01:26:03,020
There's a storm watch.

1322
01:26:03,124 --> 01:26:05,319
Yanagisawa's there, too.

1323
01:26:05,426 --> 01:26:07,587
- It's not up to them.
- Why not?

1324
01:26:07,695 --> 01:26:09,185
It's our house, after all.

1325
01:26:10,598 --> 01:26:14,864
Naosuke. What's this about?

1326
01:26:18,139 --> 01:26:19,629
We can't leave them alone.

1327
01:26:19,741 --> 01:26:21,834
But they seem to be getting along.

1328
01:26:21,943 --> 01:26:23,570
That's why I'm going!

1329
01:26:24,312 --> 01:26:27,770
You're not making any sense.
I don't get it.

1330
01:26:27,982 --> 01:26:31,349
I'm afraid those fellow craftsmen
might hit it off.

1331
01:26:31,452 --> 01:26:32,942
What's wrong with that?

1332
01:26:39,294 --> 01:26:42,286
What's the point of getting jealous?

1333
01:26:43,398 --> 01:26:44,888
Don't stop me.

1334
01:26:44,999 --> 01:26:49,459
And your deadline?
You haven't written a word!

1335
01:26:55,143 --> 01:26:59,603
We might as well wait
'til my son-in-law arrives.

1336
01:26:59,714 --> 01:27:02,182
Why's he coming?

1337
01:27:03,585 --> 01:27:04,745
I wonder...

1338
01:27:04,953 --> 01:27:07,717
I've got work to do.
Give him my regards.

1339
01:27:08,723 --> 01:27:10,418
Thanks for stopping in.

1340
01:28:05,179 --> 01:28:06,646
It's all my fault.

1341
01:28:08,349 --> 01:28:10,180
Why did you come?

1342
01:28:26,567 --> 01:28:29,798
They'll tow your van tomorrow.

1343
01:28:29,904 --> 01:28:31,895
- Sorry for the trouble.
- It's my fault.

1344
01:28:32,006 --> 01:28:34,031
No one's to blame, in this rain.

1345
01:28:35,176 --> 01:28:37,167
I'm just glad you're OK.

1346
01:28:39,447 --> 01:28:41,312
I feel bad for the chief.

1347
01:28:43,618 --> 01:28:45,108
Your house, then?

1348
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:53,850
Stop, stop, stop!

1349
01:28:55,663 --> 01:28:59,190
He was moving a piece of furniture.

1350
01:29:00,034 --> 01:29:01,126
Furniture?

1351
01:29:01,936 --> 01:29:06,703
Headed back to repair it overnight,
when I hit him.

1352
01:29:07,375 --> 01:29:09,104
I see.

1353
01:29:09,811 --> 01:29:13,872
It belongs to a special client.
He's got to restore it by morning.

1354
01:29:34,802 --> 01:29:36,963
An Edwardian cylinder bureau.

1355
01:29:37,472 --> 01:29:39,997
Was it this much of a wreck?

1356
01:29:40,108 --> 01:29:41,075
Of course not.

1357
01:29:42,410 --> 01:29:45,038
The drawers stuck, that's all.

1358
01:29:46,347 --> 01:29:48,474
This is hopeless.

1359
01:29:54,622 --> 01:29:55,782
How much was it worth?

1360
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:57,380
2 million yen.

1361
01:29:59,127 --> 01:30:00,116
Let's fix it!

1362
01:30:01,529 --> 01:30:02,553
It's lmpossible.

1363
01:30:02,663 --> 01:30:03,254
But...

1364
01:30:03,364 --> 01:30:04,194
I'll pay damages.

1365
01:30:04,432 --> 01:30:05,490
Who can afford it?

1366
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,363
Even money can't fix this mess.

1367
01:30:07,468 --> 01:30:09,527
Get me my tool box.

1368
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:14,435
You can't fix it.

1369
01:30:14,542 --> 01:30:15,941
Not if you don't try.

1370
01:30:16,477 --> 01:30:17,967
There's no way!

1371
01:30:21,616 --> 01:30:26,144
We've got all night to
put it back together, rlght?

1372
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:30,156
What do you know about it!
It's Edwardian!

1373
01:30:31,759 --> 01:30:36,458
And what do you know!
I'm a Japanese carpenter!

1374
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:41,125
Been one for 51 years.

1375
01:30:44,605 --> 01:30:48,974
Besides, no matter what we do,

1376
01:30:50,344 --> 01:30:52,835
it won't get any worse than it is.

1377
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:04,425
Let's trust Japanese carpentry.

1378
01:31:23,044 --> 01:31:24,568
A general idea...

1379
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:30,649
This is how it should look.

1380
01:31:34,789 --> 01:31:36,188
That's no use.

1381
01:31:39,594 --> 01:31:40,686
OK.

1382
01:31:41,195 --> 01:31:42,287
Chief.

1383
01:31:44,198 --> 01:31:48,601
Let's remove everything
that sn't solid.

1384
01:31:48,703 --> 01:31:49,635
Dismantle?

1385
01:31:49,737 --> 01:31:51,204
Yes, melt the glue.

1386
01:31:51,439 --> 01:31:55,102
I need you to go boil some water.

1387
01:31:55,209 --> 01:31:58,474
And I need a tube,
as narrow as possible.

1388
01:31:58,579 --> 01:31:59,603
Right.

1389
01:32:18,633 --> 01:32:19,759
Here goes.

1390
01:32:23,237 --> 01:32:24,829
I think it's about ready.

1391
01:32:51,032 --> 01:32:51,999
Hot, hot, hot!

1392
01:32:53,568 --> 01:32:54,694
Hot!

1393
01:32:54,969 --> 01:32:56,960
It's hot, Father!

1394
01:33:07,648 --> 01:33:08,774
There.

1395
01:33:13,854 --> 01:33:15,481
Any usable nails?

1396
01:33:15,923 --> 01:33:16,787
None.

1397
01:33:16,891 --> 01:33:18,085
Any new ones?

1398
01:33:18,192 --> 01:33:19,284
Plenty of nails here.

1399
01:33:19,393 --> 01:33:22,021
But these nail heads are
vintage, unique.

1400
01:33:22,129 --> 01:33:24,427
Don't have any here.

1401
01:33:24,532 --> 01:33:25,521
Oh, no.

1402
01:33:25,633 --> 01:33:26,657
We'll make them.

1403
01:33:26,867 --> 01:33:27,993
Make them?

1404
01:33:28,502 --> 01:33:29,833
We do it all the time.

1405
01:33:37,845 --> 01:33:39,574
Line up all the pieces.

1406
01:33:45,753 --> 01:33:46,617
Right there.

1407
01:33:46,721 --> 01:33:47,881
That one next.

1408
01:33:47,989 --> 01:33:48,956
Hurry.

1409
01:33:49,056 --> 01:33:50,114
Losing your pants.

1410
01:33:55,997 --> 01:34:00,457
Start with the main frame.
Attach #18 to #34.

1411
01:34:00,801 --> 01:34:01,859
Right.

1412
01:34:19,620 --> 01:34:21,349
It's coming along.

1413
01:34:21,722 --> 01:34:23,451
Coming along.

1414
01:34:23,557 --> 01:34:25,821
Attach #23 to #38.

1415
01:34:26,627 --> 01:34:27,559
#38.

1416
01:34:27,662 --> 01:34:28,651
Right.

1417
01:34:30,197 --> 01:34:31,186
Those pants.

1418
01:34:31,298 --> 01:34:32,265
Right.

1419
01:34:41,108 --> 01:34:42,132
What are you doing!

1420
01:34:47,381 --> 01:34:50,782
I just picked it up, really...

1421
01:34:51,285 --> 01:34:52,377
It's hopeless.

1422
01:34:56,290 --> 01:35:00,556
You said it couldn't get any worse!
It's turning into a disaster!

1423
01:35:10,404 --> 01:35:11,837
Let's just give it up.

1424
01:35:15,009 --> 01:35:16,237
I appreciate your spirit.

1425
01:35:16,944 --> 01:35:19,037
Let's find another plank.

1426
01:35:21,215 --> 01:35:23,581
I think I saw one
like it out there.

1427
01:35:23,684 --> 01:35:26,881
Don't be ridiculous!
This isn't just any old wood!

1428
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:37,456
Then substitute a piece of wood
that doesn't show.

1429
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:44,094
This one...

1430
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:54,042
This one?

1431
01:35:54,148 --> 01:35:56,708
That's for the side,
you can't substitute it.

1432
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:58,515
No good.

1433
01:36:00,054 --> 01:36:00,713
This one?

1434
01:36:02,123 --> 01:36:03,112
Oh, no.

1435
01:36:11,031 --> 01:36:15,024
You only see #12 when you
open the drawer, it might work.

1436
01:36:23,544 --> 01:36:25,876
I think it'll work.

1437
01:36:26,413 --> 01:36:27,175
It works!

1438
01:36:32,453 --> 01:36:33,351
No.

1439
01:36:33,454 --> 01:36:34,443
Why not?

1440
01:36:34,655 --> 01:36:36,088
Different process.

1441
01:36:39,226 --> 01:36:40,318
Chief?

1442
01:36:42,797 --> 01:36:44,264
It's tongue-in-groove.

1443
01:36:45,266 --> 01:36:46,255
Tongue-in-groove?

1444
01:36:46,367 --> 01:36:50,030
Yeah, see this groove here?

1445
01:36:50,504 --> 01:36:51,493
Yes.

1446
01:36:51,705 --> 01:36:54,799
It's a method called
tongue-in-groove.

1447
01:36:57,745 --> 01:37:01,977
Guess carpenters come up with
the same ideas all over the world.

1448
01:37:03,083 --> 01:37:05,574
Bring my tongue-in-groove tool.

1449
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:06,980
Sure thingl

1450
01:37:12,626 --> 01:37:14,355
Can you replicate it?

1451
01:37:15,162 --> 01:37:16,789
It has to be identical?

1452
01:37:17,231 --> 01:37:18,664
If possible.

1453
01:37:18,766 --> 01:37:21,929
That'll be tough.

1454
01:37:24,972 --> 01:37:28,169
I've never done such sloppy work.

1455
01:37:29,643 --> 01:37:34,637
Whoever made this piece,
wasn't much of a carpenter.

1456
01:37:42,523 --> 01:37:46,357
What's a tongue-in-groove tool?
I'm sorry...

1457
01:38:01,809 --> 01:38:04,471
But won't this reduce its value?

1458
01:38:04,645 --> 01:38:09,048
Old furniture isn't valuable because it's old.

1459
01:38:09,450 --> 01:38:12,817
It's been cherished over the years
because it functions.

1460
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:18,325
When it breaks, you fix it.
It doesn't hurt its value.

1461
01:38:35,542 --> 01:38:38,636
Get me some varnlsh.

1462
01:38:38,812 --> 01:38:39,506
Right.

1463
01:38:39,613 --> 01:38:43,413
Regular varnish'll give it
a Japanese sheen.

1464
01:38:43,517 --> 01:38:45,781
Sorry, there's F rench in the van.

1465
01:38:45,886 --> 01:38:48,013
- French?
- French polish.

1466
01:39:14,515 --> 01:39:16,210
- Bring that.
- Right.

1467
01:40:01,462 --> 01:40:03,987
Todaiji Temple in Nara

1468
01:40:04,198 --> 01:40:07,258
has the huge Nandaimon Gate.

1469
01:40:07,368 --> 01:40:09,768
Nandaimon Gate, of course.

1470
01:40:10,070 --> 01:40:12,937
Built in the 8th century, I think.

1471
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:16,498
It's been restored several times.

1472
01:40:17,111 --> 01:40:20,274
After centuries,
they found an ink pot

1473
01:40:20,381 --> 01:40:23,282
on one of the crossbeams.

1474
01:40:23,684 --> 01:40:28,018
We're talking
many meters up n the air.

1475
01:40:28,489 --> 01:40:29,751
An ink pot?

1476
01:40:30,090 --> 01:40:31,182
Yeah.

1477
01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:35,686
We use these to mark lumber.

1478
01:40:35,863 --> 01:40:37,262
Right.

1479
01:40:37,998 --> 01:40:40,660
Did a carpenter forget it?

1480
01:40:40,768 --> 01:40:45,535
No one knows the real story.
But the thing is,

1481
01:40:45,773 --> 01:40:50,107
we believe that a carpenter,
whoever he was,

1482
01:40:50,611 --> 01:40:54,911
intentionally left it behind,
you see?

1483
01:40:55,015 --> 01:40:59,645
Proof that he was the one
who built this Gate.

1484
01:41:00,554 --> 01:41:05,184
I get it! Sort of like a painter
signing his painting.

1485
01:41:05,592 --> 01:41:08,152
No, everyone sees a signature,
that's no good.

1486
01:41:11,298 --> 01:41:13,391
The ink pot is a secret

1487
01:41:15,536 --> 01:41:19,495
between you and God.

1488
01:41:21,175 --> 01:41:24,872
That's the important thing.

1489
01:41:25,479 --> 01:41:30,348
That's the spirit...
of a true carpenter.

1490
01:41:31,885 --> 01:41:33,853
What a great story.

1491
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:41,286
Juraku...

1492
01:41:42,262 --> 01:41:44,355
No line between ceiling and wall.

1493
01:41:45,165 --> 01:41:49,033
It expresses the eternity
of the universe.

1494
01:42:05,752 --> 01:42:06,810
Take a look.

1495
01:42:07,121 --> 01:42:08,179
What? Showing off?

1496
01:42:08,288 --> 01:42:09,846
Hold it to the light.

1497
01:42:11,925 --> 01:42:15,793
You can see right through it!
You're amazing.

1498
01:42:15,963 --> 01:42:18,796
Incredible technique.

1499
01:42:19,032 --> 01:42:21,296
It's like 0.2mm thick.

1500
01:42:21,635 --> 01:42:24,035
Been at it 51 years.

1501
01:42:24,638 --> 01:42:25,696
Excuse me.

1502
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:27,400
Yanagisawa.

1503
01:42:29,576 --> 01:42:30,565
What are you?

1504
01:42:30,677 --> 01:42:32,406
I can plane a board.

1505
01:42:32,513 --> 01:42:34,105
Yanagisawa.

1506
01:42:34,214 --> 01:42:35,613
Better not.

1507
01:42:39,553 --> 01:42:40,815
Ouch.

1508
01:42:44,291 --> 01:42:47,454
Hey, yours is really thin, too.
Amazing!

1509
01:42:47,828 --> 01:42:49,386
But Father wins.

1510
01:42:49,897 --> 01:42:51,762
If I could use both hands...

1511
01:42:52,032 --> 01:42:55,365
It's plenty impressive,
but Father wins.

1512
01:42:56,770 --> 01:42:57,794
That's impressive.

1513
01:42:57,905 --> 01:42:59,839
Oh, no, that's nothing.

1514
01:42:59,940 --> 01:43:01,430
I'm impressed, too.

1515
01:43:01,542 --> 01:43:02,941
Now it's my turn.

1516
01:43:05,312 --> 01:43:07,041
It's really no good.

1517
01:43:07,915 --> 01:43:09,712
I'm really impressed, you're good.

1518
01:43:09,816 --> 01:43:10,874
Have a drink?

1519
01:43:10,984 --> 01:43:13,009
Gee, thanks.

1520
01:43:14,421 --> 01:43:17,481
Hey, it's stuck.

1521
01:43:17,591 --> 01:43:19,218
You beat me.

1522
01:43:19,326 --> 01:43:21,089
Oh, not at all.

1523
01:43:21,361 --> 01:43:23,591
I better stop bragging.

1524
01:43:23,697 --> 01:43:25,688
Next time, I'll beat you.

1525
01:43:25,799 --> 01:43:26,788
I swear I won't.

1526
01:43:29,069 --> 01:43:33,005
If only my daughter had
married a guy like you...

1527
01:43:33,106 --> 01:43:34,266
What an honor.

1528
01:43:34,374 --> 01:43:35,966
Who said honor...

1529
01:43:36,076 --> 01:43:38,135
Please, Father, c'mon...

1530
01:43:40,414 --> 01:43:42,609
It was a joke, a joke.

1531
01:43:45,686 --> 01:43:47,176
Why don't you join us?

1532
01:43:48,455 --> 01:43:49,752
Thank youl

1533
01:43:54,861 --> 01:43:55,691
Excuse me.

1534
01:43:55,796 --> 01:43:59,197
After all, it's your house...

1535
01:44:30,163 --> 01:44:31,152
Maestro.

1536
01:44:32,399 --> 01:44:34,060
Chief, are you sure?

1537
01:44:34,167 --> 01:44:35,361
Yup.

1538
01:44:50,350 --> 01:44:52,079
You, too, maestro.

1539
01:44:56,990 --> 01:44:58,582
Then, this.

1540
01:45:09,136 --> 01:45:10,569
Son-in-law?

1541
01:45:10,937 --> 01:45:12,666
Me, too? Sure it's OK?

1542
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:14,835
It's your house.

1543
01:45:15,976 --> 01:45:16,840
Hurry.

1544
01:45:16,977 --> 01:45:18,137
Just wait.

1545
01:45:22,182 --> 01:45:23,444
This, then.

1546
01:46:18,605 --> 01:46:20,470
When were you born?

1547
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:21,868
Hurry.

1548
01:46:21,975 --> 01:46:23,772
Stop running around.

1549
01:46:23,877 --> 01:46:27,836
I've seen you on that TV show.

1550
01:46:28,749 --> 01:46:30,979
Nlce to see you.

1551
01:46:41,895 --> 01:46:45,353
This way, Kent, hurry.

1552
01:46:47,300 --> 01:46:51,202
House- Warming Party

1553
01:46:51,304 --> 01:46:52,168
Help yourself.

1554
01:46:52,272 --> 01:46:53,933
Thanks, Tamiko.

1555
01:46:54,040 --> 01:46:55,473
Enjoy yourself.

1556
01:46:55,575 --> 01:46:58,976
Your vegetable sign
is cauliflower...

1557
01:46:59,179 --> 01:47:00,646
Help yourself.

1558
01:47:01,314 --> 01:47:02,246
Your sign?

1559
01:47:02,349 --> 01:47:04,374
Mine is a Manganji pepper.

1560
01:47:04,484 --> 01:47:05,542
Manganji?

1561
01:47:05,719 --> 01:47:07,482
Don't you know?

1562
01:47:07,587 --> 01:47:11,751
It's a green pepper,
about this size.

1563
01:47:12,058 --> 01:47:15,084
It's deliclous
if you cook it with...

1564
01:47:15,929 --> 01:47:18,659
I'd say the walls are
a little too white.

1565
01:47:18,999 --> 01:47:19,966
Oh, really?

1566
01:47:20,066 --> 01:47:25,197
You'll see once you settle in.
Pure white wal s hurt your eyes.

1567
01:47:25,305 --> 01:47:26,897
Terrific, girls.

1568
01:47:27,841 --> 01:47:30,105
Oh, no, don't. Brotherl

1569
01:47:30,210 --> 01:47:34,772
Girls, cut it out! No!

1570
01:48:13,487 --> 01:48:16,183
Can I get you anything?
Are you fine?

1571
01:48:16,289 --> 01:48:17,449
Fine.

1572
01:48:20,193 --> 01:48:21,785
Thank you.

1573
01:48:52,692 --> 01:48:53,784
Help yourself.

1574
01:48:53,894 --> 01:48:54,758
Thanks.

1575
01:48:54,895 --> 01:48:57,625
I always watch your show.

1576
01:48:57,731 --> 01:49:00,461
And your commercial!

1577
01:49:00,567 --> 01:49:03,593
Your show's coming up.

1578
01:49:04,337 --> 01:49:07,932
Oh, I remember this concept.

1579
01:49:08,041 --> 01:49:09,440
I saw thls one.

1580
01:49:09,543 --> 01:49:12,944
You're serious fans.
Makes it hard to recycle ideas.

1581
01:49:13,046 --> 01:49:15,310
Really gotta watch it, OK?

1582
01:49:15,715 --> 01:49:17,046
He turned it off.

1583
01:49:24,391 --> 01:49:25,915
You can serve that.

1584
01:49:26,459 --> 01:49:27,619
Yanagisawa go home?

1585
01:49:27,727 --> 01:49:30,389
Oh, perfect. Take this outside?

1586
01:49:30,997 --> 01:49:31,793
Your father?

1587
01:49:31,898 --> 01:49:33,331
The Japanese room.

1588
01:49:33,567 --> 01:49:35,057
Excuse me.

1589
01:49:35,902 --> 01:49:39,895
Yes, oh, how exquisite.

1590
01:49:41,174 --> 01:49:42,505
Naosuke.

1591
01:49:49,683 --> 01:49:51,082
You did a wonderful job.

1592
01:49:54,454 --> 01:49:56,445
Mom, let me do that.

1593
01:50:08,668 --> 01:50:09,794
Maestro.

1594
01:50:15,108 --> 01:50:17,508
I don't especially like you.

1595
01:50:18,645 --> 01:50:20,442
But I like this house.

1596
01:50:24,618 --> 01:50:25,607
Thank you.

1597
01:50:25,719 --> 01:50:26,913
Nice job.

1598
01:50:47,374 --> 01:50:49,239
Eat up, everyone.

1599
01:50:49,342 --> 01:50:52,038
Thank you.

1600
01:50:52,879 --> 01:50:54,210
Have a drink, Naosuke.

1601
01:50:54,314 --> 01:50:55,440
Where's Father?

1602
01:50:55,548 --> 01:50:58,073
Isn't he around? I just saw him.

1603
01:50:58,451 --> 01:51:00,282
Where'd he go?

1604
01:51:02,355 --> 01:51:03,652
Down the hatch.

1605
01:51:03,757 --> 01:51:05,884
Down the hatch? Sure.

1606
01:51:17,771 --> 01:51:19,398
What's next?

1607
01:51:23,576 --> 01:51:25,237
Nothing.

1608
01:51:25,979 --> 01:51:29,107
But some day,
you'll do a big job, right?

1609
01:51:35,922 --> 01:51:38,584
Turned into a great house.

1610
01:51:42,228 --> 01:51:44,560
It certainly did.

1611
01:51:45,432 --> 01:51:47,559
Even if the door opens out.

1612
01:51:49,002 --> 01:51:51,527
Never heard of one opening in.

1613
01:51:51,705 --> 01:51:53,332
Most American homes...

1614
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:57,604
