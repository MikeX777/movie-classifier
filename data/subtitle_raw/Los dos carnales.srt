1
00:00:43,517 --> 00:00:45,517
Pablito!

2
00:00:46,175 --> 00:00:48,175
Come here, sonny.

3
00:00:55,062 --> 00:00:57,595
Sorry, kid, you're fired.

4
00:00:59,925 --> 00:01:02,858
But why, if I'm doing my job well?

5
00:01:03,493 --> 00:01:05,493
It's because you're so young,...

6
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,833
and of an age to still be at school.

7
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:11,977
I don't go to school because I need to work.

8
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,817
Yeah, sure, but I don't want trouble with the authorities,...

9
00:01:15,917 --> 00:01:17,453
so you're out of here.

10
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,413
¤ If God lets me grow...

11
00:01:40,513 --> 00:01:44,197
¤ I will ask Him at once...

12
00:01:44,297 --> 00:01:46,991
¤ to never let me be...

13
00:01:48,162 --> 00:01:52,108
¤ just one more ill-fated creature of Him.

14
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:55,536
¤ I want Him to teach me...

15
00:01:55,936 --> 00:02:00,479
¤ how to struggle and defeat life's challenges. 

16
00:02:01,865 --> 00:02:04,946
¤ Don't want to be no general,...

17
00:02:05,066 --> 00:02:09,284
¤ let alone president,...

18
00:02:09,384 --> 00:02:12,628
¤ neither do I want to yap...

19
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:17,126
¤ like so many people do....

20
00:02:17,226 --> 00:02:20,673
¤ those who earn their bread...

21
00:02:21,073 --> 00:02:25,819
¤ with the sweat of their brow.

22
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:30,545
¤ When I'm grown up, I want...

23
00:02:30,645 --> 00:02:34,721
¤ to choose my own fate,...

24
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:38,581
¤ a love that doesn't deceive,...

25
00:02:38,681 --> 00:02:41,907
¤ to feel decent...

26
00:02:42,007 --> 00:02:45,539
¤ and to live a stranger to hunger...

27
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:50,313
¤ where there aren't so many people around.

28
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:07,021
¤ Nor do I want to consider...

29
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:11,086
¤ a full career...

30
00:03:11,186 --> 00:03:14,284
¤ only to be forced to clock in...

31
00:03:14,384 --> 00:03:18,178
¤ way early in the morning...

32
00:03:18,278 --> 00:03:21,888
¤ just to be grumbled down...

33
00:03:22,088 --> 00:03:27,050
¤ by an illiterate boss.

34
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,102
¤ When I'm grown up, I want...

35
00:03:32,202 --> 00:03:35,960
¤ to choose my own fate,...

36
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,620
¤ a love that doesn't deceive,...

37
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,304
¤ to feel decent...

38
00:03:43,504 --> 00:03:46,860
¤ and to live a stranger to hunger...

39
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:53,054
¤ where there aren't so many people around. ¤

40
00:04:31,314 --> 00:04:33,314
I'm hungry.

41
00:04:33,682 --> 00:04:35,682
Well, see what you can find,...

42
00:04:35,782 --> 00:04:37,428
I dropped the eggs.

43
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:39,469
Oh, get out of the way!

44
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:40,987
I'll fix them.

45
00:04:41,163 --> 00:04:43,830
You're a dreadful cook. 

46
00:04:46,914 --> 00:04:49,047
Why not add some jam?

47
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:53,086
What for? Use your finger instead, it'll taste better.

48
00:04:53,186 --> 00:04:54,825
What a laugh!

49
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,098
So you don't burn yourself...

50
00:05:18,082 --> 00:05:20,082
You got most of it.

51
00:05:45,923 --> 00:05:49,590
~ They ran me out of the shop.
~ They ran me out of the shop.

52
00:05:50,986 --> 00:05:54,253
The shop foreman said: "No, kid, beat it,...

53
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:57,293
"you're too young to be a car repair apprentice."

54
00:05:57,393 --> 00:05:59,372
The Spaniard in the bakery said the same thing,...

55
00:05:59,572 --> 00:06:02,085
that he didn't want problems with the authorities.

56
00:06:03,304 --> 00:06:06,637
It's not the first time we've been chased out of our jobs.

57
00:06:06,737 --> 00:06:08,640
And it won't be the last.

58
00:06:09,016 --> 00:06:11,349
It'll be this way until we're adults.

59
00:06:11,726 --> 00:06:15,926
Tomorrow it's the same old same old.

60
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,650
It's your turn to wash the dishes.

61
00:06:20,495 --> 00:06:22,495
And your turn to dry them.

62
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:35,811
~ You know what, buddy?
~ What?

63
00:06:35,947 --> 00:06:38,214
The tenth of May's only three days away.

64
00:06:38,714 --> 00:06:41,636
Give me a break, you've been saying that for a month!

65
00:06:43,044 --> 00:06:45,044
Well, yeah, buddy,...

66
00:06:45,144 --> 00:06:49,582
you said so because you don't have a special someone to give a present to.

67
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,744
Sorry, buddy.

68
00:06:54,766 --> 00:06:56,766
I didn't mean that.

69
00:06:57,528 --> 00:07:00,295
I forgot that your mom is gone.

70
00:07:00,395 --> 00:07:02,371
My mom died when I was born.

71
00:07:03,836 --> 00:07:05,836
I grew up in an orphanage.

72
00:07:05,936 --> 00:07:08,797
At my very first opportunity, I escaped...

73
00:07:08,897 --> 00:07:10,681
and here I am.

74
00:07:10,893 --> 00:07:13,026
Yes, but let's not talk about it.

75
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:16,134
You see, look, I don't have a father.

76
00:07:16,342 --> 00:07:19,342
I have my mom, but she's in prison...

77
00:07:20,026 --> 00:07:22,026
accused of theft,...

78
00:07:22,126 --> 00:07:23,646
unjustly.

79
00:07:23,746 --> 00:07:25,611
Look:...

80
00:07:27,702 --> 00:07:29,702
I've got forty pesos.

81
00:07:29,848 --> 00:07:31,848
You save up twenty...

82
00:07:31,948 --> 00:07:34,502
and soon we'll have the amount demanded by the bondsman...

83
00:07:34,602 --> 00:07:36,490
to get your mom out of jail.

84
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:39,908
No, buddy, I can't take your money.

85
00:07:40,008 --> 00:07:41,889
You always do the same thing!

86
00:07:42,116 --> 00:07:46,916
You and your mom have done much more than that for me, you've accepted me into your home like it was my own,...

87
00:07:47,427 --> 00:07:49,427
and we're blood brothers forever, right?

88
00:07:50,591 --> 00:07:52,591
That's right.

89
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:58,716
Well, with what you earn and with mine,...

90
00:07:58,887 --> 00:08:01,954
God willing, soon we will have the amount...

91
00:08:02,054 --> 00:08:03,930
so we can spring your mom.

92
00:08:04,593 --> 00:08:06,593
OK, take this. They're one...

93
00:08:37,152 --> 00:08:39,152
Another bloody day has gone.

94
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:42,115
You should give thanks rather than curse.

95
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:46,223
Each day that passes, we're closer to freedom.

96
00:08:46,409 --> 00:08:48,409
Thanks, lady, but...

97
00:08:48,841 --> 00:08:51,141
you only got two years for your theft.

98
00:08:51,241 --> 00:08:53,184
I haven't stolen anything.

99
00:08:53,642 --> 00:08:57,042
The owner of the jewelry store blamed me for everything, and...

100
00:08:57,142 --> 00:08:58,512
they sentenced me.

101
00:08:58,612 --> 00:09:00,981
Oh, baby, don't play innocent!

102
00:09:01,704 --> 00:09:04,571
Everyone in here sings the same song.

103
00:09:05,926 --> 00:09:09,193
But I stole from the old dear I worked for.

104
00:09:09,794 --> 00:09:15,127
And if I left right now I could break her neck.

105
00:09:15,433 --> 00:09:18,566
That's what you should do to your employer.

106
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:23,232
No. I have my son to think about.

107
00:09:23,332 --> 00:09:28,156
I'm just waiting to finish up this sentence so I can make up for all the lost time.

108
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:30,809
Hey, Sister,...

109
00:09:30,909 --> 00:09:33,200
you're really taking it bad!

110
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:36,422
You should be a soap opera star...

111
00:09:36,522 --> 00:09:38,279
or something like that.

112
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:42,380
You speak like that because you don't know the joy of having a child.

113
00:09:43,178 --> 00:09:45,178
You're right.

114
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:49,599
I lost my child at birth.

115
00:09:51,814 --> 00:09:53,814
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

116
00:09:54,025 --> 00:09:56,025
Don't sweat it.

117
00:09:56,995 --> 00:10:00,728
You still haven't told me who your son's father is.

118
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,930
His name's Cristóbal,...

119
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:07,690
he's a rich guy.

120
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,370
Let me guess.

121
00:10:09,615 --> 00:10:11,715
He abandoned you and took up with someone else, right?

122
00:10:11,893 --> 00:10:16,026
No. I left him when I learned he had someone else.

123
00:10:18,354 --> 00:10:20,821
You never considered getting back with him?

124
00:10:21,322 --> 00:10:23,322
No.

125
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:26,107
He's a strong guy with a violent temper.

126
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:28,539
He'd never forgive me.

127
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:31,479
He's stubborn and obsessive...

128
00:10:37,164 --> 00:10:39,164
Sonia,...

129
00:10:40,549 --> 00:10:42,549
are you asleep?

130
00:10:47,544 --> 00:10:49,544
What's up?

131
00:10:49,344 --> 00:10:51,423
Whose turn is to use the pajama shirt? 

132
00:10:51,523 --> 00:10:53,442
Don't play the silly, it's yours!

133
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,637
I'm asking for the bottom bunk, OK?

134
00:11:04,737 --> 00:11:06,467
I know!

135
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:08,151
But turn off the light.

136
00:11:21,297 --> 00:11:23,117
There we go.

137
00:11:32,937 --> 00:11:34,937
NO OPENINGS

138
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:49,702
¤ How I miss the streets of my home town.

139
00:11:49,802 --> 00:11:53,807
¤ Unfortunately I had to leave them.

140

¤ But my mother was taken to the Eternal...

141
00:11:57,443 --> 00:12:01,597
¤ and I had to leave to find work.

¤ My beautiful homeland I remember...

143
00:12:05,364 --> 00:12:11,030
¤ when I roam the vast capital.

144

¤ I thought I was an abandoned child,...

145
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:22,469
¤ an orphan, and overwhelmed by my problems...

146
00:12:23,261 --> 00:12:27,361

¤ They don't understand these two kids...

155
00:13:16,532 --> 00:13:21,746

156
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:28,064

162
00:13:59,077 --> 00:14:01,077
No way, brother,...

163
00:14:01,177 --> 00:14:02,471
today wasn't my day.

164
00:14:02,571 --> 00:14:05,668
I was already holding it just right forh pedaling...

165
00:14:05,941 --> 00:14:09,374
when suddenly a damned truck got in my way.

166
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:12,114
I was already a seasoned expert with my stilts...

167
00:14:12,514 --> 00:14:15,116
and unexpectedly, those dogs got in my way...

168
00:14:15,216 --> 00:14:17,091
and I fell all the way down. 

169
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:21,619
You two, both of you.

170
00:14:22,352 --> 00:14:24,352
You want to earn a few pesos?

171
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,490
What do we have to do?

172
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,903
Come on,...

173
00:14:29,003 --> 00:14:30,111
I'll tell you all about it.

174
00:14:48,933 --> 00:14:50,933
Look at this guy.

175
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:52,543
Thinks we're going to steal the brush.

176
00:14:52,943 --> 00:14:55,989
At least we didn't waste the whole day without work.

177
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:58,546
It's the work of a Chinaman.

178
00:14:58,646 --> 00:15:00,549
Oh, count to 10!

179
00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:02,168
What for?

180
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:04,109
It's a cure for anger.

181
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:05,686
How far have you counted?

182
00:15:05,885 --> 00:15:07,885
Me? Up to 500.

183
00:15:07,985 --> 00:15:09,298
I always count past 500.

184
00:15:09,398 --> 00:15:11,131
Listen, you guys.

185
00:15:11,531 --> 00:15:14,386
I didn't hire you to stand around yapping.

186
00:15:14,561 --> 00:15:17,894
Back to work if you want to earn those pesos.

187
00:15:18,094 --> 00:15:19,662
What do you think we're doing...

188
00:15:20,123 --> 00:15:22,623
playing marbles or what?

189
00:15:22,783 --> 00:15:24,729
Shut up, or you'll piss him off!

190
00:15:25,229 --> 00:15:27,923
Hey, you're wetting me, take that hose away!

191
00:15:36,423 --> 00:15:38,423
We're looking for Don Cristóbal.

192
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:41,538
Why are you looking for him, Francisco?

193
00:15:42,031 --> 00:15:44,964
You know where the main office is,...

194
00:15:45,564 --> 00:15:46,770
and his house.

195
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:49,680
We were in these parts and we heard he's around here.

196
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:53,510
Don Cristóbal has other building sites like this one.

197
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,110
Have you already been to the other building sites?

198
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,053
Don't play stupid, Tomás...

199
00:15:58,153 --> 00:15:59,438
he ought to be here.

200
00:15:59,838 --> 00:16:01,101
Of course he should be here!

201
00:16:02,014 --> 00:16:04,814
Fine, will you call him, or should we go look for him?

202
00:16:05,014 --> 00:16:06,968
I don't think that suits you,...

203
00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:11,732
especially you who have families to support.

204
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:15,208
Don't play smart with us, Tomás.

205
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,807
Call Don Cristóbal.

206
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:20,359
What the hell do you want, Francisco?

207
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,530
I want to talk with you.

208
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,485
Wouldn't it be better if you got to work?

209
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:32,179
I do not neglect your interests, boss, but I also represent the interests of my peers.

210
00:16:34,878 --> 00:16:36,878
OK.

211
00:16:37,715 --> 00:16:41,182
Let's end this once and for all.

212
00:16:40,982 --> 00:16:41,867
You come in.

213
00:16:55,216 --> 00:16:57,216
And you, who are you?

214
00:16:57,587 --> 00:16:59,987
I'm Toño and he's my friend Pablo.

215
00:17:00,188 --> 00:17:03,055
They're just scrubbing the path, Don Cristóbal.

216
00:17:09,888 --> 00:17:13,555
There's really nothing you can do to help kids like those, Francisco.

217
00:17:14,135 --> 00:17:18,335
No employee who works in my companies will be unionized.

218
00:17:19,192 --> 00:17:23,692
We have the right, Don Cristóbal, to improve our living conditions.

219
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,164
What rights are you talking about?

220
00:17:26,305 --> 00:17:28,372
I pay them enough money.

221
00:17:28,472 --> 00:17:32,444
If then they decide to spend it in bars, that's their problem.

222
00:17:33,535 --> 00:17:35,802
We want to be part of the union...

223
00:17:35,902 --> 00:17:39,069
to get better earnings and working conditions.

224
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:40,087
Absolutely not.

225
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:43,719
So you better give up those ideas...

226
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,999
if you do not want to end up out of work.

227
00:17:46,783 --> 00:17:50,550
If you do that, Don Cristóbal, we will go on strike.

228
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,232
What, you're threatening me?

229
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:56,277
No, boss. Just think about it before brushing us off.

230
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:08,726
Those workers are very angry. How come, buddy?

231
00:18:08,826 --> 00:18:10,167
Beats me.

232
00:18:10,267 --> 00:18:12,033
Well, we'd better go collect, right?

233
00:18:13,873 --> 00:18:15,873
Here's your pay.

234
00:18:23,501 --> 00:18:26,501
If you want more jobs, just drop in here.

235
00:18:27,686 --> 00:18:29,686
There's always something needing doing.

236
00:18:29,786 --> 00:18:31,700
Thank you, sir.

237
00:18:37,227 --> 00:18:39,627
Did you see the site boss,...

238
00:18:39,727 --> 00:18:40,815
Don Cristóbal?

239
00:18:40,915 --> 00:18:41,863
Yes. What about him?

240
00:18:43,446 --> 00:18:47,713
I don't know...It felt like I'd seen him before somewhere.

241
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:50,994
Are you feeling all right?

242
00:18:51,094 --> 00:18:55,754
Look, pal, you'd better pay the back rent due to Don Rodolfo.

243
00:18:55,854 --> 00:18:57,139
All of it?

244
00:18:56,939 --> 00:18:58,886
But we only owe him five payments!

245
00:18:59,286 --> 00:19:03,154
Anyway! If we pay him we'll be out of the money...

246
00:19:03,254 --> 00:19:06,364
that we should be giving to the bondsman to spring your Mom.

247
00:19:06,859 --> 00:19:08,859
No, kiddo.

248
00:19:09,522 --> 00:19:12,989
If Don Rodolfo throws us out of the room, then he throws us out...

249
00:19:13,489 --> 00:19:15,485
but Mom is the first thing..

250
00:19:16,209 --> 00:19:17,809
Well, do as you please.

251
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:19,336
The room's yours,...

252
00:19:19,836 --> 00:19:21,608
I'm only a guest.

253
00:19:22,607 --> 00:19:24,740
No, buddy, I didn't mean that.

254
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,784
What I meant was that I wouldn't mind sleeping outside.

255
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:31,102
Don Rodolfo is a nice old guy,...

256
00:19:31,202 --> 00:19:34,183
maybe he won't complain if we pay him just a single payment.

257
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:40,929
Listen, Toño,...

258
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,919
don't you miss your parents?

259
00:19:44,136 --> 00:19:49,169
Yes. I think it would be nice to call someone Mom and Dad...

260
00:19:49,269 --> 00:19:51,278
and to know who your parents are.

261
00:19:51,678 --> 00:19:53,401
Hey, Toño,...

262
00:19:53,501 --> 00:19:56,155
I don't care if you call mine mom, too.

263
00:19:56,271 --> 00:19:58,671
Anyway, she loves you as much as she loves me.

264
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:30,160
¤ Give me, for God's sake, your blessing,... 

265
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:33,600
¤ oh, my beloved mother,...

266
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,493
¤ I beg your pardon,...

267
00:20:36,993 --> 00:20:40,077
¤ for you having suffered so much.

268
00:20:40,177 --> 00:20:43,280
¤ Where you are now, in Father's house,...

269
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,988
¤ a sight I crave,...

270
00:20:47,188 --> 00:20:49,986
¤ oh, Mother dear,...

271
00:20:50,086 --> 00:20:53,860
¤ pray for me to God.

272
00:20:56,707 --> 00:21:00,293
¤ You who are in the mansion of the heavenly throne...

273
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:03,649
¤ send to my heart a motherly sigh.

274
00:21:03,749 --> 00:21:06,421
¤ A maternal sigh send to my heart,...

275
00:21:06,521 --> 00:21:09,758
¤ may it reach, oh, may it reach my heart.

276
00:21:09,758 --> 00:21:12,924
¤ Look, mother, there's no one in the world who loves you as I do.

277
00:21:13,124 --> 00:21:16,590
¤ See that a mother's love is as great as God's.

278
00:21:17,328 --> 00:21:20,528
¤ Look, mother, there's no one in the world who loves you as I do.

279
00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:24,126
¤ mother's love passed by, and it was my only delight.

280
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,480
¤ You who are in the mansion of the heavenly throne...

281
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,922
¤ send to my heart a motherly sigh.

282
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:50,031
¤ A maternal sigh send to my heart

283
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:53,275
¤ may it reach, oh, may it reach my heart.

284
00:21:53,475 --> 00:21:56,820
¤ Look, mother, there's no one in the world who loves you as I do.

285
00:21:57,308 --> 00:22:00,708
¤ You'll see a mother's love is as great as God's.

286
00:22:00,613 --> 00:22:04,013
¤ Look, mother, there's no one in the world who loves you as I do.

287
00:22:04,434 --> 00:22:08,101
¤ Mother's love passed by, and it was my only delight.

288
00:22:20,283 --> 00:22:23,609
¤ Give me, for God's sake, your blessing...

289
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:27,052
¤ oh, my dear mother,...

290
00:22:27,152 --> 00:22:30,030
¤ and I beg your pardon...

291
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:33,603
¤ for you having suffered so much.

292
00:22:33,703 --> 00:22:36,739
¤ Where you are now, in Father's house,...

293
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:40,909
¤ a sight I crave,...

294
00:22:41,009 --> 00:22:43,573
¤ oh, Mother dear,...

295
00:22:43,673 --> 00:22:47,063
¤ pray for me to God. ¤

296
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:26,703
I'll get some refreshments.

297
00:23:31,621 --> 00:23:33,621
Coward!

298
00:23:39,857 --> 00:23:42,524
Don Rodolfo! Blessed are eyes that see.

299
00:23:42,924 --> 00:23:44,436
Why are you visiting?

300
00:23:44,636 --> 00:23:47,564
Quit fooling around --- I'm here for the rent.

301
00:23:48,866 --> 00:23:50,866
Come on in! Come in!

302
00:23:53,024 --> 00:23:55,024
Do you want a glass of water?

303
00:23:55,755 --> 00:23:58,755
Speaking of rent arrears, you owe me six.

304
00:23:58,855 --> 00:24:00,119
That many?

305
00:24:00,219 --> 00:24:03,221
What do you mean, "that many"? You haven't paid me a thing in six months!

306
00:24:03,721 --> 00:24:06,393
Time sure flies, doesn't it. Don Rudi?

307
00:24:06,986 --> 00:24:10,053
Don't change the subject. I want my money.

308
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:11,774
Coincidently, I have it right here.

309
00:24:16,436 --> 00:24:18,436
What's this?

310
00:24:18,236 --> 00:24:20,194
This much only covers one month's rent.

311
00:24:20,608 --> 00:24:22,608
This is better than nothing.

312
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:24,694
There isn't any money, Don Rudi.

313
00:24:24,785 --> 00:24:27,718
Look, kid, I've given you a lot of breaks.

314
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:31,172
It's not my fault your mom's been banged up in the slammer.

315
00:24:31,322 --> 00:24:35,389
She and I had an understanding, so either pay me or move out.

316
00:24:48,429 --> 00:24:50,429
What a child of your sainted mother!

317
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:54,010
Did you see the old man?

318
00:24:54,233 --> 00:24:58,200
He says that if we don't pay him what we owe, he'll run us off.

319
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,574
Then let's work hard.

320
00:25:00,674 --> 00:25:02,162
Shall we go visit Tomás?

321
00:25:02,262 --> 00:25:03,490
Maybe he's got work for us.

322
00:25:04,757 --> 00:25:07,757
OK. Let's go.

323
00:25:09,315 --> 00:25:13,982
OK, but I can only keep you on part time.

324
00:25:14,188 --> 00:25:16,688
You're both school-aged...

325
00:25:16,788 --> 00:25:18,426
and I don't want a hassle.

326
00:25:18,565 --> 00:25:23,832
Do not worry, Tomás, we're used to working odd jobs.

327
00:25:24,955 --> 00:25:26,655
But what is there to be done?

328
00:25:26,755 --> 00:25:30,080
Come along. I'll show you.

329
00:25:33,168 --> 00:25:35,168
Tomorrow's visiting day.

330
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:38,026
I can't resist the desire to see my husband and children.

331
00:25:38,126 --> 00:25:39,486
Me, too.

332
00:25:40,075 --> 00:25:42,075
You want some?

333
00:25:42,175 --> 00:25:44,226
Of course, to relieve the tension.

334
00:25:46,987 --> 00:25:49,187
How long are you going to be here?

335
00:25:49,287 --> 00:25:51,071
Two years!

336
00:25:51,171 --> 00:25:53,150
That's nothing.

337
00:25:53,824 --> 00:25:55,524
It feels like an eternity to me.

338
00:25:55,624 --> 00:25:57,025
Hey, girl!

339
00:25:57,718 --> 00:26:00,518
You should try to see the good side of all this.

340
00:26:01,576 --> 00:26:03,576
Here we get fed,...

341
00:26:03,976 --> 00:26:05,779
and free clothes,...

342
00:26:06,689 --> 00:26:08,289
and even a bed.

343
00:26:08,389 --> 00:26:09,478
But no company.

344
00:26:09,578 --> 00:26:11,050
Who cares about that?

345
00:26:13,111 --> 00:26:15,378
I'm used to being on my own.

346
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I am alone inside...

347
00:26:18,861 --> 00:26:20,861
and I'm alone outside.

348
00:26:21,143 --> 00:26:23,143
So why should I care?

349
00:26:23,335 --> 00:26:26,635
But you're different. I've got a son,...

350
00:26:26,735 --> 00:26:28,301
he's eleven years old.

351
00:26:29,192 --> 00:26:32,259
Oh, cutie, you're very worried about your son!

352
00:26:33,533 --> 00:26:37,000
And within three years he'll fall in love and drop you like a dead pigeon.

353
00:26:38,547 --> 00:26:40,547
Pablo? Like Hell he will!

354
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:42,683
No, he's different.

355
00:26:42,783 --> 00:26:45,451
My despair is that he's out there all alone,...

356
00:26:45,551 --> 00:26:46,960
not knowing what to do...

357
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,246
Such is life.

358
00:26:49,335 --> 00:26:51,335
We get hit over and over again.

359
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:56,076
But have faith: your son will end up being a man.

360
00:26:56,507 --> 00:26:58,507
You don't have someone you can make him stay with?

361
00:26:58,349 --> 00:27:00,482
He lives with a friend of his own age

362
00:27:00,582 --> 00:27:02,886
who has it even worse than he does.

363
00:27:03,286 --> 00:27:04,999
Why?

364
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:09,017
My son has me, even if I'm rotting in jail,...

365
00:27:09,165 --> 00:27:12,965
but Toño, as far as I know, has no one.

366
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:15,733
The poor kid!

367
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:20,363
Now, into formation, come on, quickly!

368
00:27:20,949 --> 00:27:22,949
Fast, move it!

369
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:25,242
Right face!

370
00:27:29,088 --> 00:27:30,688
Move, move!

371
00:27:30,788 --> 00:27:31,853
Ditch the cigarette!

372
00:27:32,367 --> 00:27:34,367
Come on, let's go.

373
00:27:36,615 --> 00:27:40,515
Quickly, quickly, let's go! Let's go!

374
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:45,875
What's your name?

375
00:27:46,029 --> 00:27:48,029
Toño, Ma'am.

376
00:27:50,084 --> 00:27:52,084
You can call me Manuela.

377
00:27:52,184 --> 00:27:53,609
Everyone else does.

378
00:27:53,852 --> 00:27:56,052
Hey, is that other guy your brother?

379
00:27:56,152 --> 00:27:57,065
Almost.

380
00:27:57,565 --> 00:27:58,818
Almost?

381
00:27:58,918 --> 00:28:00,799
We're just like family.

382
00:28:01,361 --> 00:28:03,361
You don't have parents?

383
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:06,670
Why are you asking me that?

384
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,970
Well, don't answer if you don't feel like it.

385
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,919
I'm an orphan.

386
00:28:12,945 --> 00:28:15,645
~ You know what, Toño?
~ What?

387
00:28:15,895 --> 00:28:17,217
We've got something in common:...

388
00:28:18,345 --> 00:28:20,345
I'm an orphan, too.

389
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,950
I don't have anybody.

390
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:26,050
And what you see here is my home.

391
00:28:36,249 --> 00:28:38,249
What's your name?

392
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:40,347
I'm Pablo.

393
00:28:40,913 --> 00:28:42,913
And what are you doing here?

394
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:45,455
I'm cleaning the window glass.

395
00:28:46,533 --> 00:28:48,533
But I'm almost done.

396
00:28:53,623 --> 00:28:55,623
Go on, beat it.

397
00:29:17,483 --> 00:29:19,483
Is something wrong?

398
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:21,293
That boy.

399
00:29:21,393 --> 00:29:23,099
What's up with him?

400
00:29:23,257 --> 00:29:25,257
I don't know.

401
00:29:25,357 --> 00:29:28,003
I have the impression of having seen him somewhere before.

402
00:29:48,247 --> 00:29:50,247
Your coffee. Extra strong, sir.

403
00:29:50,885 --> 00:29:52,885
Like you like it.

404
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,357
Julián.

405
00:29:55,457 --> 00:29:56,710
Sir.

406
00:29:59,574 --> 00:30:01,274
Do you remember my wife?

407
00:30:01,441 --> 00:30:04,508
Sure, she was very good looking.

408
00:30:05,301 --> 00:30:07,301
And Pablito, our boy?

409
00:30:07,401 --> 00:30:08,523
Yes, sir.

410
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:14,009
I saw him today, Julián.

411
00:30:14,109 --> 00:30:15,664
Sir!

412
00:30:15,723 --> 00:30:18,123
It's been eight years since...

413
00:30:18,214 --> 00:30:20,481
Yes. Since she left with the boy.

414
00:30:21,754 --> 00:30:23,754
I'm sorry, sir.

415
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,293
He's the spitting image of his mother.

416
00:30:29,581 --> 00:30:32,781
He ought to be 11 by now.

417
00:30:33,186 --> 00:30:35,186
Yes.

418
00:30:36,336 --> 00:30:39,869
He's been at the construction headquarters these past few days...

419
00:30:39,969 --> 00:30:41,275
laboring,...

420
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:42,867
with a little buddy.

421
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:45,553
Excuse me. Have you told him who he is?

422
00:30:46,432 --> 00:30:48,432
No.

423
00:30:48,967 --> 00:30:52,700
I prefer that it all be forgotten now, as it has been all along.

424
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,161
But she's your wife, sir.

425
00:30:54,461 --> 00:30:56,308
And that boy is your son.

426
00:31:03,973 --> 00:31:06,573
Miss Marisa is coming to dinner.

427
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:09,533
Have everything ready.

428
00:31:09,633 --> 00:31:11,272
Certainly, sir.

429
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,760
200 pesos, pal!

430
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,144
It won't be long before we get the 2,000,...

431
00:31:43,544 --> 00:31:46,742
so we can pay the bondsman to get her out of jail.

432
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:50,290
I'd wanted to rob a bank.

433
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:52,107
You'll see we'll soon have saved that much, buddy.

434
00:31:52,207 --> 00:31:53,436
Go on, take it.

435
00:31:54,394 --> 00:31:56,861
I'll hide it in the broken chair.

436
00:31:56,961 --> 00:31:58,503
In there's a good hiding place.

437
00:31:58,603 --> 00:32:01,897
Bring the musical instruments to rehearse tomorrow's gig.

438
00:32:01,997 --> 00:32:02,497
OK.

439
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,700
Now what? I broke it!

440
00:32:56,361 --> 00:32:58,946
¤ The calf hasn't sucked,...

441
00:32:59,046 --> 00:33:01,000
¤ the calf hasn't sucked,...

442
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,332
¤ because the cow did not come,...

443
00:33:03,632 --> 00:33:05,221
¤ because the cow did not come.

444
00:33:05,321 --> 00:33:07,451
¤ My grandmother feeds it,...

445
00:33:07,551 --> 00:33:09,400
¤ my grandmother feeds it,...

446
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,414
¤ with the trash from the road,

447
00:33:11,593 --> 00:33:13,593
¤ because that was its destiny.

448
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,783
¤ Lasso it, lasso it,...

449
00:33:16,183 --> 00:33:17,992
¤ lasso it so it doesn't leave.

450
00:33:18,092 --> 00:33:21,834
¤ Give me your arms, my soul, granny, if you really love me.

451
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:24,550
¤ Lasso it, lasso it,...

00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:26,633

¤ Grab me into your arms, my soul, granny, if you really love me.

00:33:58,822 --> 00:34:00,822

00:34:01,086 --> 00:34:03,086
¤ I have the pleasure of the calf.

457
00:34:03,268 --> 00:34:05,268
¤ Up and down the hill,...

458
00:34:05,568 --> 00:34:07,388
¤ up and down the hill,...

459
00:34:07,539 --> 00:34:09,539
¤ I walk among the cows...

460
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:11,199
¤ I walk among the cows...

00:34:26,574 --> 00:34:28,558

00:35:00,864 --> 00:35:04,397

¤ The calf hasn't sucked. ¤

484
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,760
What's up with the furniture?

485
00:35:50,908 --> 00:35:52,908
What the Hell's going on?

486
00:35:54,397 --> 00:35:55,997
Don Rodolfo!

487
00:35:56,097 --> 00:35:58,490
Don Rodolfo was the one who took the furniture.

488
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:02,035
He didn't want to wait for us to pay the back rent.

489
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,501
So what do we do now?

490
00:36:04,949 --> 00:36:06,949
The old grunge!

491
00:36:10,815 --> 00:36:13,515
The furniture, buddy! The chair.

492
00:36:13,622 --> 00:36:15,252
Yeah, he took it.

493
00:36:15,859 --> 00:36:17,859
Don't be silly,...

494
00:36:17,959 --> 00:36:20,148
the couch's where I was hiding the can...

495
00:36:20,248 --> 00:36:23,276
with the savings we had to get my mom out of jail.

496
00:36:23,376 --> 00:36:24,560
No, pal,...

497
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,467
the old guy couldn't be that mean.

498
00:36:27,211 --> 00:36:29,411
That old guy is a dried up old mummy.

499
00:36:29,511 --> 00:36:32,859
Let's find him and demand that he return our money.

500
00:36:32,959 --> 00:36:34,084
Man!

501
00:36:34,184 --> 00:36:35,901
We don't have his address.

502
00:36:36,301 --> 00:36:38,699
He'll come here to collect the rents of the others.

503
00:36:38,799 --> 00:36:41,193
We'll be waiting for him. Come on.

504
00:36:43,961 --> 00:36:46,028
And where do we sleep now?

505
00:36:46,472 --> 00:36:48,072
Beats me.

506
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:50,512
Shall we go to the construction headquarters to see if they'll have mercy on us?

507
00:36:51,016 --> 00:36:53,016
Yeah, let's go check.

508
00:36:53,887 --> 00:36:57,220
Look, they even took the nails for hanging our helmets.

509
00:37:12,284 --> 00:37:14,284
We want our money.

510
00:37:14,384 --> 00:37:15,828
What money?

511
00:37:15,928 --> 00:37:18,336
Don't play dumb, our money.

512
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:20,379
Yeah. It was hidden in the sofa.

513
00:37:20,911 --> 00:37:22,711
Well, if you'd had money hidden,...

514
00:37:22,811 --> 00:37:24,812
it's probably because you stole it, right?

515
00:37:25,012 --> 00:37:27,481
We're not thieves, Don Rodolfo,...

516
00:37:27,581 --> 00:37:29,115
and you know it.

517
00:37:29,215 --> 00:37:31,993
This money was put aside to get my mom out of jail.

518
00:37:32,393 --> 00:37:35,665
I took the furniture because you owe me a lot of money.

519
00:37:35,812 --> 00:37:39,612
All right. Keep your filthy room,...

520
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:42,690
but we want our money and our furniture.

521
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:46,738
I sold the furniture to cover the debt you owe me,....

522
00:37:46,838 --> 00:37:48,900
and if you had money in there, then it's as good as gone.

523
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,925
Now let me through. Go on, beat it.

524
00:37:54,217 --> 00:37:56,217
Old thief!

525
00:37:56,317 --> 00:37:59,174
That old jerk will remember us, Toño.

526
00:37:59,365 --> 00:38:01,432
Yes, give him his due.

527
00:38:04,442 --> 00:38:06,442
I have an idea, Toño. Come on.

528
00:38:30,583 --> 00:38:34,383
At least he'll have to spend it on new paint for his car.

529
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:35,607
Yes, we really let him have it.

530
00:38:35,989 --> 00:38:37,989
Don Cristóbal!

531
00:38:38,089 --> 00:38:41,390
There won't be any work until he recognizes our union.

532
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,610
No work!

533
00:38:45,055 --> 00:38:47,055
Look, buddy,

534
00:38:47,155 --> 00:38:48,668
this is going to be bad.

535
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:51,244
What we ask for is just fair.

536
00:38:51,344 --> 00:38:53,730
Sign or not a single truck will budge.

537
00:38:56,316 --> 00:39:00,316
Sign, Don Cristóbal, so we can get back to work!

538
00:39:02,653 --> 00:39:04,653
Sign!

539
00:39:08,385 --> 00:39:10,385
Gather your people together and throw them out.

540
00:39:11,169 --> 00:39:13,169
Yes, sir.

541
00:39:21,653 --> 00:39:23,720
UNION RECOGNITION!

542
00:39:25,374 --> 00:39:27,374
Attack them!

543
00:39:27,956 --> 00:39:29,956
Let's go!

544
00:40:25,693 --> 00:40:27,693
Why are you heating the water?

545
00:40:27,984 --> 00:40:29,984
To heal up the hurt guys.

546
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,813
What? Could you be on Francisco's side?

547
00:40:33,981 --> 00:40:35,981
Well, yes. Yes, I am. Yeah.

548
00:40:36,207 --> 00:40:39,507
So why not take part in the demonstration?

549
00:40:39,607 --> 00:40:42,437
No, I'm too old to mess in those things. No.

550
00:40:43,068 --> 00:40:45,068
Besides, I need the work.

551
00:40:45,668 --> 00:40:47,594
Send a coffee to Don Cristóbal.

552
00:40:52,554 --> 00:40:54,554
You take it him yourself.

553
00:40:56,556 --> 00:40:58,556
Wait.

554
00:41:10,215 --> 00:41:12,815
So that old guy took away your room...

555
00:41:14,084 --> 00:41:16,084
what a pity!

556
00:41:16,184 --> 00:41:17,728
So where will you sleep?

557
00:41:17,866 --> 00:41:19,866
Where the night finds us.

558
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:22,353
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

559
00:41:22,704 --> 00:41:25,304
If they let us sleep in the cellar...

560
00:41:25,404 --> 00:41:27,551
my blood brother and I would work real hard .

561
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,785
Well, that's no problem for me, but...

562
00:41:30,204 --> 00:41:32,804
only Don Cristóbal can authorize that.

563
00:41:33,322 --> 00:41:35,322
And he's a sour man.

564
00:41:35,422 --> 00:41:37,376
That guy's evil.

565
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:40,279
Look, let's try one thing:...

566
00:41:40,379 --> 00:41:43,305
the first chance I get I'll mention it to him, OK?

567
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,626
Meanwhile...

568
00:41:47,704 --> 00:41:49,704
I'll give you some money, here.

569
00:41:49,804 --> 00:41:52,106
~ Thanks, Manuela.
~ To get a hotel room.

570
00:41:52,277 --> 00:41:55,395
OK, help me get breakfast ready, or no one eats today.

571
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:07,522
Thanks. Hang on.

572
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:09,830
How old are you?

573
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:12,039
Eleven, sir.

574
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:16,283
Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you.

575
00:42:16,905 --> 00:42:18,905
I'm not scared of you, sir.

576
00:42:19,005 --> 00:42:20,639
Do you have a family?

577
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:23,747
Just my mother.

578
00:42:23,847 --> 00:42:25,073
And where is your Mom?

579
00:42:25,173 --> 00:42:26,587
My Mom?

580
00:42:27,605 --> 00:42:29,605
Mom's on a trip.

581
00:42:30,701 --> 00:42:33,501
Has your mother told you anything about your Dad?

582
00:42:36,432 --> 00:42:38,432
No. She never has.

583
00:42:40,748 --> 00:42:42,748
Fine, Don Cristóbal,...

584
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,893
goodbye.

585
00:42:49,459 --> 00:42:51,459
Doña Manuela is as generous as can be.

586
00:42:52,061 --> 00:42:55,061
She said she would talk to the owner of the building site...

587
00:42:55,161 --> 00:42:58,379
to see whether he'll let Toño and me sleep in the cellar.

588
00:42:58,479 --> 00:43:00,246
But don't worry, Mom.

589
00:43:00,669 --> 00:43:02,669
Thank God!

590
00:43:02,769 --> 00:43:06,195
I was worried about not knowing where you were sleeping.

591
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:08,333
Old usurer!

592
00:43:08,433 --> 00:43:11,409
He couldn't wait a few months for me to pay him the rent.

593
00:43:12,281 --> 00:43:13,881
I don't know, Mom,...

594
00:43:13,981 --> 00:43:15,500
people are very strange.

595
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,307
Also, the owner of the building site was asking me many questions.

596
00:43:20,407 --> 00:43:22,995
If my mom would talk about my dad,...

597
00:43:23,422 --> 00:43:25,422
how old I was,...

598
00:43:25,522 --> 00:43:27,275
and where you were.

599
00:43:28,501 --> 00:43:30,968
Why would he want to know all that?

600
00:43:32,049 --> 00:43:34,582
Who knows? But I didn't tell him a thing.

601
00:43:35,722 --> 00:43:39,922
Don Cristóbal will pay for all the treatment for Francisco García,...

602
00:43:40,022 --> 00:43:42,020
and is willing to compensate him.

603
00:43:42,285 --> 00:43:44,285
I regret what happened, Juan,...

604
00:43:44,492 --> 00:43:46,892
but I accept the responsibility.

605
00:43:47,101 --> 00:43:51,701
Look, Cristóbal, the police have not intervened in this...

606
00:43:51,801 --> 00:43:53,751
because it's a labor dispute,...

607
00:43:53,999 --> 00:43:56,332
but we can't stay on the sideline...

608
00:43:56,452 --> 00:43:58,652
if the row is repeated today.

609
00:43:59,152 --> 00:44:03,140
I advise you to reach an agreement soon with your employees.

610
00:44:06,163 --> 00:44:08,163
And now, you. What's up with you?

611
00:44:09,151 --> 00:44:11,151
I'm worried about my son.

612
00:44:11,251 --> 00:44:12,823
What's up with him?

613
00:44:13,601 --> 00:44:16,101
The owner of the building site where he works...

614
00:44:16,201 --> 00:44:18,654
has been asking questions about me.

615
00:44:20,585 --> 00:44:22,485
Hey, woman!

616
00:44:22,541 --> 00:44:24,741
You still care about those things.

617
00:44:26,758 --> 00:44:28,758
Your son is very smart.

618
00:44:29,058 --> 00:44:30,839
He can surely take care of himself.

619
00:44:31,653 --> 00:44:33,653
At this point,...

620
00:44:33,709 --> 00:44:36,376
he knows more about life than you and me together.

621
00:44:36,878 --> 00:44:38,878
And that, Sister,

622
00:44:38,978 --> 00:44:40,326
is really saying something!

623
00:44:43,242 --> 00:44:45,909
The two kids are homeless.

624
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:49,703
Don Cristóbal, Pablito's mother is in jail,...

625
00:44:50,257 --> 00:44:52,257
wrongfully convicted.

626
00:44:52,512 --> 00:44:54,112
Toño's an orphan.

627
00:44:54,212 --> 00:44:56,051
And how does that make them my problem?

628
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:59,120
OK,...

629
00:44:59,203 --> 00:45:01,203
I only wanted,...

630
00:45:01,538 --> 00:45:04,471
I want you to let them sleep in the cellar.

631
00:45:05,071 --> 00:45:08,645
Well, if you find a place they can stay, fine.

632
00:45:09,177 --> 00:45:11,177
Thank you.

633
00:45:11,277 --> 00:45:13,043
Thank you, Don Cristóbal.

634
00:45:13,667 --> 00:45:16,934
You say Pablito's mom is in jail?

635
00:45:17,077 --> 00:45:19,077
That's right, sir,...

636
00:45:19,326 --> 00:45:21,326
on a theft charge.

637
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:27,780
By your leave.

638
00:45:37,078 --> 00:45:39,078
You can sleep here.

639
00:45:39,178 --> 00:45:41,238
If you want something, you already know where the kitchen is.

640
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:42,440
Thank you, Ma'am.

641
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,914
~ Good night.
~ Good night.

642
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,480
Sun.

643
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:03,426
Eagle. Hard luck.

644
00:46:03,526 --> 00:46:04,860
You lost, you get the bottom.

645
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,388
Well, at least it's better than sleeping on the street.

646
00:46:08,588 --> 00:46:09,955
Yeah.

647
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:13,790
150 pesos.

648
00:46:15,258 --> 00:46:17,258
152.

649
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:21,687
At the rate we will never get the 2,000 pesos we have to give the bondsman...

650
00:46:21,787 --> 00:46:23,975
to get my mom out of jail.

651
00:46:24,705 --> 00:46:27,572
Look, you work here on the site,...

652
00:46:27,672 --> 00:46:29,356
and I'll work the streets.

653
00:46:29,795 --> 00:46:32,462
Sure, but here we're better as a pair. Look,...

654
00:46:32,914 --> 00:46:35,981
we've got food and somewhere to stay.

655
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:38,332
Yeah, but they're not paying us very much.

656
00:46:39,412 --> 00:46:41,412
Look, brother,...

657
00:46:41,672 --> 00:46:45,939
if I go out on the street I'll have a chance to earn more money.

658
00:46:46,632 --> 00:46:49,165
Sure, but we've always been together.

659
00:46:49,565 --> 00:46:51,545
Always.

660
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:53,384
Working the street.

661
00:46:53,484 --> 00:46:55,093
Don't be silly, brother.

662
00:46:55,493 --> 00:46:59,117
If both of us hit the streets, they'll kick us out of the cellar and take away the food.

663
00:47:01,216 --> 00:47:03,216
You're right.

664
00:47:03,664 --> 00:47:05,664
But why are you doing this,...

665
00:47:06,065 --> 00:47:08,432
when it's my mom who's locked up?

666
00:47:08,532 --> 00:47:10,297
Because we're practically brothers, right?

667
00:47:10,397 --> 00:47:12,791
What's mine is yours and what's yours is mine.

668
00:47:16,594 --> 00:47:18,594
Now let's go to sleep!

669
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:30,078
Where are you going, Pablo?

670
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:33,766
To see my mom.

671
00:47:33,866 --> 00:47:35,505
Where?

672
00:47:41,469 --> 00:47:43,469
The woman's prison.

673
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,405
The other day I misled you.

674
00:47:46,723 --> 00:47:48,723
My mom's not on a trip.

675
00:47:50,282 --> 00:47:54,749
Don't worry. You don't have to be ashamed just because someone should happen to be stuck in there.

676
00:47:55,449 --> 00:47:57,400
Yes, sir.

677
00:47:58,302 --> 00:48:01,202
Why's your mom in the woman's prison?

678
00:48:01,302 --> 00:48:03,045
They accused her of being a jewel thief.

679
00:48:03,445 --> 00:48:05,705
I swear to you that she was innocent.

680
00:48:06,542 --> 00:48:08,542
Her boss was heavy...

681
00:48:08,956 --> 00:48:10,956
and infatuated with her.

682
00:48:11,538 --> 00:48:13,538
She never payed attention to him.

683
00:48:13,838 --> 00:48:18,144
I'm sure he framed her for something so she'd be put away.

684
00:48:18,244 --> 00:48:21,192
I'm going to help you get your mom out of jail,...

685
00:48:23,044 --> 00:48:25,311
but you have to promise me something.

686
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:31,507
When you learn who your father is, you forgive him,...

687
00:48:31,607 --> 00:48:33,052
and you learn to understand him.

688
00:48:33,152 --> 00:48:34,877
I've forgiven him.

689
00:48:34,977 --> 00:48:37,550
I misled you, when I told you...

690
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:40,491
that my mom'd never spoken about my dad...

691
00:48:42,133 --> 00:48:44,133
she did all the time.

692
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:47,131
And she spoke well of him.

693
00:48:52,685 --> 00:48:55,985
If you want, I'll take you. Get in.

694
00:49:17,383 --> 00:49:19,383
He's as generous as can be, Mom.

695
00:49:21,141 --> 00:49:24,341
He pays great money, and he's willing to help you.

696
00:49:24,441 --> 00:49:26,520
I don't understand why he wants to do this.

697
00:49:27,387 --> 00:49:29,387
Because he's a good guy, Mom.

698
00:49:29,545 --> 00:49:31,845
He's good, I like him.

699
00:49:32,537 --> 00:49:34,537
I hope you get to know him.

700
00:49:40,502 --> 00:49:42,502
Bravo!

701
00:49:47,069 --> 00:49:51,069
The fight was a result of the stubbornness of Don Cristóbal,...

702
00:49:51,469 --> 00:49:54,555
but also gives us evidence that he's about to give up.

703
00:49:54,655 --> 00:49:56,470
We must strike harder.

704
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:58,390
We'll go for a complete strike!

705
00:50:00,879 --> 00:50:05,879
Cristóbal Márquez has no choice but to accept the existence of our union!

706
00:50:05,979 --> 00:50:07,826
Whoopee!

707
00:50:15,931 --> 00:50:17,931
Don Cristóbal isn't here.

708
00:50:18,031 --> 00:50:20,819
I can't allow the flag in that position.

709
00:50:21,019 --> 00:50:23,705
It doesn't matter whether you agree or not,...

710
00:50:24,068 --> 00:50:26,535
so don't step in, Tomás.

711
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:30,360
You haven't learned your lesson, Francisco?

712
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:34,317
Do you want to repeat the dose?

713
00:50:34,561 --> 00:50:36,961
Look, we don't want problems,...

714
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:41,034
but like it or not, we'll put up this strike flag.

715
00:50:43,338 --> 00:50:45,338
There aren't a lot of you.

716
00:50:45,738 --> 00:50:49,241
I don't think that you're in any state to stand up to us.

717
00:50:58,875 --> 00:51:00,875
Strike!

718
00:51:02,094 --> 00:51:05,161
I think Don Cristóbal has lost the battle.

719
00:51:13,936 --> 00:51:15,936
Whoopee!

720
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:24,726
Don Cristóbal will help us get my mom out of jail, man.

721
00:51:24,826 --> 00:51:26,093
Great, brother!

722
00:51:26,193 --> 00:51:28,511
I've got good news, too.

723
00:51:28,611 --> 00:51:30,230
I got a job.

724
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:32,054
Working in that building.

725
00:51:32,154 --> 00:51:33,920
How unexpected, buddy! How'd you do that?

726
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:35,460
Because the boss is a straight arrow.

727
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,803
When he saw my knowledge and abilities...

728
00:51:38,203 --> 00:51:39,435
he gave me the job.

729
00:51:40,463 --> 00:51:42,463
He gave you the job!

730
00:55:38,318 --> 00:55:40,318
CONGRATULATIONS

731
00:55:41,712 --> 00:55:43,712
Bravo!

732
00:55:51,385 --> 00:55:53,918
I hope you had a nice day, Mom.

733
00:55:54,018 --> 00:55:55,694
Thanks, son.

734
00:55:55,836 --> 00:55:58,536
Thanks, Pablito. And thanks for coming, Toño.

735
00:55:58,636 --> 00:55:59,878
My pleasure, Ma'am.

736
00:55:59,978 --> 00:56:03,107
Let's hope this is the last May 10th you spend here in jail.

737
00:56:04,288 --> 00:56:09,021
Yes, Mom, next year, God willing, you'll be with us at home.

738
00:56:36,415 --> 00:56:40,715
¤ Lovely one that God has given me...

739
00:56:40,803 --> 00:56:42,803
¤ to love,...

740
00:56:43,292 --> 00:56:52,459
¤ you, lovely one who loves me without condition,...

741
00:56:53,065 --> 00:57:01,298
¤ Heaven gave me love without earning it,...

742
00:57:01,708 --> 00:57:10,741
¤ by looking at her eyes you'll learn who it is.

743
00:57:11,567 --> 00:57:20,767
¤ With her no pain could lead to despair...

744
00:57:21,741 --> 00:57:29,041
¤ lovely one that loves me with sweet love,...

745
00:57:29,682 --> 00:57:37,382
¤ for her there's no pain she won't comfort away,...

746
00:57:37,795 --> 00:57:47,195
¤ by looking into her face I'm looking at God.

747
00:57:48,658 --> 00:57:53,658
¤ Oh, how happy I am...

748
00:57:54,125 --> 00:57:58,625
¤ when I hear her talk!

749
00:57:58,737 --> 00:58:03,137
¤ How much love I bring her...

750
00:58:03,495 --> 00:58:07,095
¤ into this song!

751
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:12,020
¤ Oh, how happy I am...

752
00:58:12,654 --> 00:58:14,954
¤ with her I'm happy.

753
00:58:15,037 --> 00:58:21,237
¤ Live your life, my love,...

754
00:58:21,541 --> 00:58:26,541
¤ the love I carry here inside.

755
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:41,290
¤ Oh, how happy I am...

756
00:58:41,528 --> 00:58:46,728
¤ when I hear her talk.

757
00:58:47,436 --> 00:58:50,536
¤ How much love I bring her...

758
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:54,461
¤ into this song!

759
00:58:54,727 --> 00:58:59,727
¤ Oh, how happy I am!

760
00:59:00,029 --> 00:59:03,629
¤ with her I'm happy.

761
00:59:03,878 --> 00:59:08,778
¤ Live your life, my love,...

762
00:59:09,051 --> 00:59:15,151
¤ the love I carry here inside.

763
00:59:32,894 --> 00:59:34,894
It's been a fine day.

764
00:59:34,994 --> 00:59:36,962
Take care of yourself, son.

765
00:59:37,062 --> 00:59:38,723
Yes, Mom,...

766
00:59:38,823 --> 00:59:41,889
and rest assured we'll have you out of here soon.

767
00:59:41,989 --> 00:59:46,431
Yes, I know you and Toño are working to save up for the bondsman,...

768
00:59:46,531 --> 00:59:49,554
but it's more important to take care of yourself and eat when you should.

769
00:59:49,654 --> 00:59:50,863
Don't worry, Ma'am,...

770
00:59:50,963 --> 00:59:52,693
Pablo and I know how to take care of ourselves.

771
00:59:53,193 --> 00:59:54,746
How good you are!

772
00:59:54,846 --> 00:59:56,704
I know how much you like each other.

773
00:59:56,804 --> 00:59:58,383
Like brothers, Mom.

774
00:59:59,098 --> 01:00:02,565
We'll come to see you next visiting day, Mom.

775
01:00:04,967 --> 01:00:06,967
Goodbye, my love.

776
01:00:44,384 --> 01:00:46,851
Cristóbal is bringing people together.

777
01:00:47,530 --> 01:00:49,530
He wants to break the strike.

778
01:00:50,294 --> 01:00:52,294
Can he do that?

779
01:00:53,176 --> 01:00:55,176
I'm afraid so.

780
01:00:55,276 --> 01:00:58,697
We must expedite the process for entering the union.

781
01:00:59,070 --> 01:01:01,270
Meanwhile, do not be intimidated.

782
01:01:01,470 --> 01:01:03,108
We support you.

783
01:01:03,508 --> 01:01:05,474
I know my rights,...

784
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:08,462
and your strike is illegal.

785
01:01:09,625 --> 01:01:11,825
Since they're not unionized,...

786
01:01:11,925 --> 01:01:13,846
they're committing a crime.

787
01:01:13,946 --> 01:01:17,392
So tomorrow I want you to bring together as many people as possible...

788
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:20,290
and you'll break the strike for me.

789
01:01:20,317 --> 01:01:22,184
There'll be brawl, Don Cristóbal.

790
01:01:22,284 --> 01:01:23,347
That doesn't matter.

791
01:01:24,035 --> 01:01:28,035
I want them to know once and for all that I'm serious.

792
01:01:36,172 --> 01:01:38,172
~ Thanks.
~ Thank you.

793
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:42,290
Hi, how are things?

794
01:01:42,632 --> 01:01:44,632
How was work?

795
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:47,870
Fine.

796
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:50,115
How about your problems?

797
01:01:50,215 --> 01:01:52,081
Better.

798
01:01:52,181 --> 01:01:53,787
I hope they are being resolved.

799
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:57,250
Let's have an ice cream --- on me.

800
01:01:59,896 --> 01:02:01,896
Good, that's fine.

801
01:02:01,996 --> 01:02:03,634
Have a seat.

802
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:08,973
Two ice creams, please.

803
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:14,453
Why do you fight so much with Don Cristóbal?

804
01:02:16,663 --> 01:02:18,930
We're trying to form a union...

805
01:02:19,030 --> 01:02:21,348
to help all the workers,...

806
01:02:21,548 --> 01:02:22,755
but he won't go for it.

807
01:02:24,548 --> 01:02:26,548
Don Cristóbal isn't a bad guy.

808
01:02:27,427 --> 01:02:32,160
If what you're asking is the right thing, maybe he'll finally go along.

809
01:02:33,970 --> 01:02:35,970
Well, maybe...

810
01:02:36,070 --> 01:02:37,344
he knows what to do.

811
01:02:37,592 --> 01:02:39,592
I'd better go, Francisco.

812
01:02:39,692 --> 01:02:41,612
I have to look for my blood brother.

813
01:02:42,012 --> 01:02:43,472
See you.

814
01:02:43,572 --> 01:02:44,671
Good, but what about the ice cream, hey?

815
01:02:44,936 --> 01:02:46,936
You can eat it.

816
01:02:47,036 --> 01:02:49,313
Another day we'll share one. See you, Francisco.

817
01:03:01,016 --> 01:03:03,016
Buddy!

818
01:03:11,522 --> 01:03:14,322
~ What's up, brother?
~ How are you, bro?

819
01:03:14,422 --> 01:03:15,980
Fine, let's go.

820
01:03:20,238 --> 01:03:22,538
Time's up, pal, shall we go?

821
01:03:22,708 --> 01:03:24,475
Yeah, I'm dead tired.

822
01:03:24,675 --> 01:03:27,145
You should be happy, you're making a lot of money.

823
01:03:27,644 --> 01:03:30,711
It's not like it used to be. I like to be by your side.

824
01:03:31,123 --> 01:03:32,923
Nothing's going to change.

825
01:03:33,193 --> 01:03:35,260
We are only separated by day.

826
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:37,236
It's not the same.

827
01:03:37,381 --> 01:03:39,381
This job is hard.

828
01:03:40,105 --> 01:03:42,572
Cheer up, man. I brought some cake.

829
01:03:42,772 --> 01:03:45,318
Of course, since you don't have to come here...

830
01:03:45,718 --> 01:03:47,795
If you want, I'll come help you every day.

831
01:03:47,895 --> 01:03:50,436
But hurry up, buddy, it's getting late.

832
01:03:51,504 --> 01:03:53,504
Hurry up, let's go, move!

833
01:03:53,604 --> 01:03:55,586
DANGER ZONE!
WELLS CLOSED!

834
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:00,619
Pablo, Pablo!

835
01:04:00,719 --> 01:04:02,127
Are you all right, Pablo?

836
01:04:02,977 --> 01:04:04,977
Pablo, answer me, pal!

837
01:04:21,317 --> 01:04:23,317
I'm going for help, Pablo!

838
01:04:23,841 --> 01:04:25,841
DANGER!
DEEP WELLS!

839
01:04:34,951 --> 01:04:36,951
Help!

840
01:04:37,055 --> 01:04:39,055
Help, Toño!

841
01:04:40,208 --> 01:04:42,275
Buddy, someone help me!

842
01:04:50,739 --> 01:04:52,739
Toño, help me!

843
01:04:54,621 --> 01:04:56,621
Toño! Bro, help me!

844
01:05:03,306 --> 01:05:05,073
Let them recognize our rights.

845
01:05:05,173 --> 01:05:06,636
Here comes Tomás and his people.

846
01:05:09,310 --> 01:05:11,510
Remove your men, Francisco,...

847
01:05:11,710 --> 01:05:13,364
and there won't be any problems.

848
01:05:13,601 --> 01:05:16,201
No one's leaving. We'll still be here at dawn.

849
01:05:19,471 --> 01:05:21,471
This is the last warning.

850
01:05:22,923 --> 01:05:25,456
We're removing your strike banners...

851
01:05:27,196 --> 01:05:29,729
and you'd better not get in our way.

852
01:05:30,073 --> 01:05:32,073
Do so and the blood will flow here.

853
01:05:34,036 --> 01:05:36,036
Gentlemen!

854
01:05:42,314 --> 01:05:45,414
I've warned you that this strike is illegal...

855
01:05:47,454 --> 01:05:49,454
so return to your homes...

856
01:05:50,088 --> 01:05:52,088
and then nothing will happen.

857
01:05:52,212 --> 01:05:54,812
How are you planning to end the strike?

858
01:05:54,912 --> 01:05:57,359
You'd have to kill me this time, Don Cristóbal,...

859
01:05:57,459 --> 01:06:01,239
I'm determined to stay here with my men until you recognize the union.

860
01:06:01,439 --> 01:06:03,083
Don't think that I won't!

861
01:06:06,972 --> 01:06:09,105
I'm sick of your rebellion!

862
01:06:11,428 --> 01:06:13,495
Don Cristóbal, Don Cristóbal!

863
01:06:14,447 --> 01:06:16,580
Pablo fell into a deep well.

864
01:06:17,378 --> 01:06:19,078
How? Where?

865
01:06:19,178 --> 01:06:21,553
Where the buildings are going up.

866
01:06:23,389 --> 01:06:25,089
Let's go.

867
01:06:29,413 --> 01:06:31,113
Let's go help that boy.

868
01:06:31,228 --> 01:06:33,228
Let's go!

869
01:06:42,834 --> 01:06:44,834
Pablo!

870
01:06:44,934 --> 01:06:46,861
Pablito!

871
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:48,925
Answer me!

872
01:06:50,374 --> 01:06:53,074
Pablito! Are you all right?

873
01:06:54,648 --> 01:06:56,648
Help me!

874
01:06:56,748 --> 01:06:58,376
Mom!

875
01:06:58,476 --> 01:07:00,190
I can't climb out!

876
01:07:00,530 --> 01:07:02,530
He's alive. He's alive!

877
01:07:07,338 --> 01:07:10,471
Quickly, boys. Bring ropes and lamps.

878
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:16,870
Help me, please! Mom!

879
01:07:20,427 --> 01:07:22,427
Blood brother!

880
01:07:22,532 --> 01:07:24,532
Pablito, hang on!

881
01:07:25,032 --> 01:07:27,041
We'll have you out in no time!

882
01:07:27,779 --> 01:07:30,779
Mom! Help me!

883
01:07:32,783 --> 01:07:34,783
Tie yourselves to the machines.

884
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:40,240
Pablo, son!

885
01:07:41,013 --> 01:07:43,013
Listen carefully!

886
01:07:43,615 --> 01:07:45,615
I'm going to lower a rope.

887
01:07:46,133 --> 01:07:48,133
Wrap it around your waist.

888
01:07:48,819 --> 01:07:50,819
Can you do that?

889
01:07:51,071 --> 01:07:53,071
I'll try, sir!

890
01:07:53,498 --> 01:07:56,798
I'll try! Oh, Mom!

891
01:07:56,833 --> 01:07:57,921
My God!

892
01:08:37,015 --> 01:08:40,015
Help, help!

893
01:08:41,315 --> 01:08:43,015
Please get me out!

894
01:08:44,138 --> 01:08:47,638
Pablo, that rope should be right by you.

895
01:08:49,201 --> 01:08:51,201
Look for it and strap it on!

896
01:08:51,301 --> 01:08:54,252
~ I can't.
~ Make an effort.

897
01:08:54,378 --> 01:08:55,626
Look around for it.

898
01:08:55,835 --> 01:08:58,835
I can't see it. I can't see a thing.

899
01:09:04,442 --> 01:09:06,442
I'm going down for him.

900
01:09:06,737 --> 01:09:09,837
It could be more than 100 feet deep, boss.

901
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:12,112
So what? I'm going down for him.

902
01:09:12,512 --> 01:09:13,732
Help me!

903
01:09:15,677 --> 01:09:17,677
Hold it right, eh?

904
01:09:18,244 --> 01:09:20,244
Hang on.

905
01:09:20,797 --> 01:09:22,797
Hold the rope there.

906
01:09:23,672 --> 01:09:25,672
Be careful, boss!

907
01:09:28,218 --> 01:09:30,218
Let the rope go, slowly.

908
01:09:30,424 --> 01:09:32,424
Little by little, little by little.

909
01:09:43,085 --> 01:09:45,085
I can't get by.

910
01:09:45,185 --> 01:09:46,869
I don't fit.

911
01:09:46,969 --> 01:09:48,415
The boss doesn't fit through.

912
01:09:48,515 --> 01:09:49,906
Pull me out.

913
01:09:51,546 --> 01:09:53,546
Slowly, slowly.

914
01:09:56,060 --> 01:09:58,060
He can make it by.

915
01:09:58,160 --> 01:09:59,757
It's very narrow.

916
01:09:59,857 --> 01:10:01,010
That's right.

917
01:10:01,110 --> 01:10:03,525
Don Cristóbal, I can get down that hole.

918
01:10:05,930 --> 01:10:07,930
We could drop him head first.

919
01:10:08,586 --> 01:10:10,586
That would be very dangerous.

920
01:10:10,686 --> 01:10:12,350
We have to do it.

921
01:10:12,450 --> 01:10:13,996
We have to try whatever we can.

922
01:10:14,096 --> 01:10:15,708
We can't lose any more time.

923
01:10:16,342 --> 01:10:18,342
That's good.

924
01:10:18,442 --> 01:10:20,060
Be very careful, boy.

925
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:23,162
When you get to Pablo, give him your arms.

926
01:10:23,262 --> 01:10:24,386
We'll draw you out.

927
01:10:24,586 --> 01:10:25,779
Yes, sir.

928
01:10:26,453 --> 01:10:28,153
Tie him snugly.

929
01:10:28,253 --> 01:10:29,557
Real well.

930
01:10:57,095 --> 01:10:59,095
Buddy!

931
01:10:59,195 --> 01:11:00,694
Where are you?

932
01:11:00,794 --> 01:11:02,351
Can you hear me?

933
01:11:07,809 --> 01:11:10,076
They're lowering me down to you, Pablo.

934
01:11:26,522 --> 01:11:28,522
Pablo!

935
01:11:28,622 --> 01:11:29,680
Is this a dream?

936
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:33,580
You'll have to grab my arms...

937
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:35,522
so they can bring us up.

938
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:38,180
Harder!

939
01:11:38,563 --> 01:11:40,563
Hold on!

940
01:11:43,277 --> 01:11:45,177
Pablo!

941
01:11:45,377 --> 01:11:47,096
Pablo!

942
01:11:47,196 --> 01:11:48,284
Son!

943
01:11:48,384 --> 01:11:50,870
Pablo, are you OK?

944
01:11:51,196 --> 01:11:53,196
Toño.

945
01:11:54,514 --> 01:11:56,514
Hold on my hands --- hard.

946
01:11:58,469 --> 01:12:01,136
I can't, I'm slippery with mud, Toño.

947
01:12:02,023 --> 01:12:04,023
Harder.

948
01:12:04,123 --> 01:12:06,007
Toño!

949
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:08,860
Answer me!

950
01:12:10,698 --> 01:12:12,698
Are you together?

951
01:12:12,798 --> 01:12:14,550
Pablo!

952
01:12:14,650 --> 01:12:15,587
Let's go!

953
01:12:15,687 --> 01:12:17,173
I told you I can't.

954
01:12:17,673 --> 01:12:19,214
I'm slipping.

955
01:12:19,314 --> 01:12:20,414
Hold on.

956
01:12:20,514 --> 01:12:21,524
Try again.

957
01:12:22,383 --> 01:12:24,783
Come on, again!

958
01:12:26,805 --> 01:12:28,805
Toño!

959
01:12:28,905 --> 01:12:30,655
Are you already holding him?

960
01:12:31,417 --> 01:12:33,417
Pablo!

961
01:12:35,169 --> 01:12:37,169
I can't!

962
01:12:38,734 --> 01:12:40,734
My hands keep slipping!

963
01:12:42,396 --> 01:12:44,396
Try again!

964
01:12:44,496 --> 01:12:46,691
Come on, boy, try again!

965
01:13:21,509 --> 01:13:23,509
How are things going?

966
01:13:23,682 --> 01:13:25,682
My son fell down a well.

967
01:13:25,782 --> 01:13:28,421
We sent another boy to get him out by the arms.

968
01:13:28,521 --> 01:13:30,433
How long has that boy been down there?

969
01:13:30,533 --> 01:13:32,539
About half an hour,...

970
01:13:32,839 --> 01:13:35,073
but he can't get a firm grip because of the mud.

971
01:13:35,238 --> 01:13:37,238
He must be removed immediately.

972
01:13:37,968 --> 01:13:39,968
We'll try something else.

973
01:13:44,524 --> 01:13:46,124
Bring him up!

974
01:13:46,305 --> 01:13:49,638
Bring him up, he can't do anything for me.

975
01:13:49,838 --> 01:13:51,726
I'm going to try once more!

976
01:13:58,156 --> 01:14:00,156
It's a landslide!

977
01:14:03,474 --> 01:14:06,074
Slack the rope, it's dangerous!

978
01:14:16,032 --> 01:14:18,032
Get back!

979
01:14:38,870 --> 01:14:40,870
Stop.

980
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:44,540
We'll dig another well parallel to this one.

981
01:14:45,340 --> 01:14:47,358
I want the charts for this whole surface.

982
01:14:47,458 --> 01:14:48,960
But that'll take too long!

983
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:51,498
My son and that boy may still be alive!

984
01:14:51,598 --> 01:14:52,788
Calm down!

985
01:14:53,488 --> 01:14:56,831
We'll try to reach them as soon as possible.

986
01:15:43,088 --> 01:15:45,088
Come on, Dolores.

987
01:15:46,755 --> 01:15:48,755
What's going on?

988
01:15:48,855 --> 01:15:50,142
No questions. Let's go!

989
01:16:09,522 --> 01:16:11,522
You?

990
01:16:19,230 --> 01:16:21,230
What are you doing here?

991
01:16:22,712 --> 01:16:24,712
Pablito,...

992
01:16:24,862 --> 01:16:26,862
our son,...

993
01:16:26,962 --> 01:16:28,848
has had an accident.

994
01:17:02,716 --> 01:17:04,316
Toño!

995
01:17:04,524 --> 01:17:07,024
Toño, Toño!

996
01:17:07,832 --> 01:17:09,832
Where?

997
01:17:10,269 --> 01:17:12,269
Where are we, Pablo?

998
01:17:14,108 --> 01:17:15,708
They're going to save us.

999
01:17:15,808 --> 01:17:17,750
They're going to save us, buddy.

1000
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:20,124
I can't budge.

1001
01:17:20,364 --> 01:17:22,364
I can't feel my body.

1002
01:17:22,464 --> 01:17:23,995
It's because of the mud.

1003
01:17:24,293 --> 01:17:26,293
We're in a muddy well.

1004
01:17:26,312 --> 01:17:29,845
Tell me the truth --- is there any hope?

1005
01:17:29,945 --> 01:17:31,479
I hope so.

1006
01:18:35,970 --> 01:18:38,737
According to the calculations, these kids ought to be...

1007
01:18:38,801 --> 01:18:41,501
between these two points.

1008
01:18:41,786 --> 01:18:43,819
But there's a risk, sir:...

1009
01:18:43,932 --> 01:18:45,999
it could produce another landslide.

1010
01:18:46,299 --> 01:18:48,983
I think if we approach from this other side...

1011
01:18:49,021 --> 01:18:51,021
we'll avoid the most fragile part.

1012
01:18:52,096 --> 01:18:54,096
No, we can't do it.

1013
01:18:55,882 --> 01:18:58,549
That would delay us for at least two hours.

1014
01:18:58,649 --> 01:19:01,947
We'll have to take risks and continue with the plan.

1015
01:19:01,747 --> 01:19:03,003
Over there, man.

1016
01:19:03,403 --> 01:19:04,420
Yes, sir, sure. Light up my way.

1017
01:19:09,544 --> 01:19:11,544
I can't see a thing.

1018
01:19:11,722 --> 01:19:13,722
Careful, careful.

1019
01:19:15,461 --> 01:19:17,461
What's that noise?

1020
01:19:17,561 --> 01:19:19,364
What's going on?

1021
01:19:19,464 --> 01:19:20,884
It's a landslide!

1022
01:19:24,377 --> 01:19:26,377
Landslide!

1023
01:19:42,795 --> 01:19:44,595
It's over.

1024
01:19:44,792 --> 01:19:46,792
Relax.

1025
01:19:47,192 --> 01:19:48,618
Yeah, it's stopped.

1026
01:19:49,662 --> 01:19:51,662
Pablo, buddy!

1027
01:19:52,172 --> 01:19:53,672
Don't be scared, Toño.

1028
01:19:53,772 --> 01:19:55,677
Don't be scared, blood brother.

1029
01:19:56,709 --> 01:19:58,709
They're going to save us.

1030
01:19:59,590 --> 01:20:01,590
They're going to save us.

1031
01:20:03,746 --> 01:20:06,746
Cristóbal, I can't stand this waiting.

1032
01:20:07,498 --> 01:20:09,498
You've got to have faith.

1033
01:20:09,598 --> 01:20:11,971
~ I'm sure they'll find them.
~ But when?

1034
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:13,716
They've been digging for eight hours.

1035
01:20:14,912 --> 01:20:16,612
It'll be dawn soon...

1036
01:20:16,712 --> 01:20:18,650
and they can't hold out much longer.

1037
01:20:18,850 --> 01:20:20,363
You have to have confidence.

1038
01:20:22,214 --> 01:20:24,214
Thanks for warning me,...

1039
01:20:24,314 --> 01:20:26,418
thanks for having managed to get me out.

1040
01:20:27,130 --> 01:20:29,130
You won't be going back to that place.

1041
01:20:29,230 --> 01:20:31,145
Everything is arranged.

1042
01:20:33,254 --> 01:20:35,254
Why did this have to happen?

1043
01:20:36,324 --> 01:20:39,257
Maybe for the two of us to meet again.

1044
01:20:40,698 --> 01:20:44,631
Look, Dolores, when I figured out that Pablito was my son,...

1045
01:20:45,231 --> 01:20:47,449
I realized how silly I had been with you.

1046
01:20:47,702 --> 01:20:50,769
You know I'm a man of few words.

1047
01:20:51,090 --> 01:20:54,623
Maybe this is a new opportunity for us.

1048
01:20:55,126 --> 01:20:57,126
I need you.

1049
01:20:57,226 --> 01:20:58,944
I need Pablito.

1050
01:20:59,833 --> 01:21:01,833
Come back to me.

1051
01:21:21,285 --> 01:21:23,652
Shine some light so I can see, man.

1052
01:21:23,784 --> 01:21:25,784
Go, go, man!

1053
01:21:32,098 --> 01:21:34,098
Full throttle ahead!

1054
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:36,250
The light!

1055
01:21:52,687 --> 01:21:55,554
~ What's happening, Francisco, don't you see them?
~ Light!

1056
01:21:57,126 --> 01:21:59,126
Don't you see them?

1057
01:22:05,386 --> 01:22:07,386
Yes!

1058
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:11,536
Are they all right?

1059
01:22:11,636 --> 01:22:13,101
Yes!

1060
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:32,240
Yes!

1061
01:22:33,807 --> 01:22:35,807
Prepare a stretcher!

1062
01:22:38,314 --> 01:22:40,314
It's Toño!

1063
01:22:52,713 --> 01:22:54,713
Bring another stretcher.

1064
01:22:54,874 --> 01:22:56,874
Step aside, step aside.

1065
01:22:57,900 --> 01:22:59,900
The other stretcher!

1066
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,968
Pablito!

1067
01:23:02,068 --> 01:23:03,526
Pablito!

1068
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:05,750
Careful! Quickly, let's move!

1069
01:23:11,181 --> 01:23:13,848
They'll be fine, Ma'am. I assure you.

1070
01:23:14,070 --> 01:23:16,070
Thanks, thanks very much!

1071
01:23:18,628 --> 01:23:20,628
Let's go. Quickly. By your leave.

1072
01:23:58,392 --> 01:24:01,192
There'll be no more problems between us.

1073
01:24:01,292 --> 01:24:03,372
I recognize your union, Francisco.

1074
01:24:03,472 --> 01:24:04,930
Thanks, boss.

1075
01:24:05,030 --> 01:24:06,460
Thanks a lot.

1076
01:24:06,832 --> 01:24:08,832
Bravo, bravo!

1077
01:24:24,023 --> 01:24:28,396
¤ To you, Daddy dear,...

1078
01:24:28,496 --> 01:24:33,033
¤ who brought me into this world,...

1079
01:24:33,530 --> 01:24:37,358
¤ my mom and you together brought me,...

1080
01:24:37,666 --> 01:24:41,866
¤ I carry your blood in my veins,...

1081
01:24:41,966 --> 01:24:46,500
¤ you have many fine points,...

1082
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:51,432
¤ I want to be like you.

1083
01:24:52,833 --> 01:24:56,511
¤ I want to follow your example...

1084
01:24:56,611 --> 01:24:59,609
¤ and our house is a temple...

1085
01:24:59,709 --> 01:25:03,910
¤ and you're my God, Papa.

1086
01:25:04,035 --> 01:25:08,128
¤ I pay attention to your ways,...

1087
01:25:08,228 --> 01:25:12,402

1088
01:25:12,802 --> 01:25:18,601
¤ thanks for being my Dad.

1089
01:25:30,099 --> 01:25:34,925
¤ Maybe I've been a bad boy,...

1090
01:25:35,001 --> 01:25:38,469
¤ because I ask and I demand...

1091
01:25:38,569 --> 01:25:43,715
¤ for what you're not able to give me.

1092

¤ I've caused you trouble,...

1093
01:25:50,314 --> 01:25:52,314
¤ anxieties and terrors...

1094
01:25:52,514 --> 01:25:57,600
¤ because I behave very badly.

1095
01:25:59,312 --> 01:26:02,576
¤ I want to follow your example...

1096
01:26:02,676 --> 01:26:05,462

1098
01:26:10,059 --> 01:26:13,908

1099
