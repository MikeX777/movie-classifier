00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:53,889
Of course, those two ladies

please?

196

You know,
I've always liked this cravat.

197
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,797
I bought it in Venice in 1966.

198
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,275
I must have been happy
at the time.

199

bought such a beautiful thing?

very far for nothing.

That is,
without our help and consent.

212

That would give him

- Anyway, Jules said he didn't
want a biography of himself.

227
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,673
He said it was like having
one's corpse publicly exhumed.

228
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:15,509
- Oh, when did he say that?

229

233
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:25,919
my dear,
where would any of us be?

234
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,482
But he must have told you
other things.

235
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:29,551
Um, for instance,
that he would be married

236
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,063

forever and ever.

237
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,359

238
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,367
He stayed married to me.

He's afraid you'll leave him.

251
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:16,531
I used to live like that,

252
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:21,535

that Jules would leave me.

253
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,378
He'd get into those black moods,

254
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:28,284

255
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,878
not to anyone,

256
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:32,288
not to Oaroline.

257
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,293
And I thought
that she'd turn against me

258
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,955
and get him to send me away.

259
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,396
Where would I go?

260
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,357

265
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,615
- Is he young and handsome?

266
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:00,675
- It depends
what you mean by that.

267
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,812
Oan you find any more teaspoons?

268
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,185

269
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,255

"Good-bye; go home"?

270
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:14,458

271

We're even letting him stay
in the house.

272
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:17,625
We're being very friendly.

273
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:20,763
- But then he might start to
think we've changed our minds.

274
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,239
- That's his problem.

275

without changing my mind.

with such hope.

- Let's think about this.

278
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:32,015
A biography would stimulate
interest in Jules' work,

279
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,383
and that is something that we,
as his executors,

280

281
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:39,415
Anyway, let's not make
any hasty decisions, shall we?

282
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,722

and it's not hasty.

is on my side.

not very successful films,

was going to Hong Kong

again.

to Tehran,

375
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,415
- What did they do?

376
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,650
- They were doctors,

377
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:34,488

378
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:36,756

four years ago.

after a few months.

382

I was 18 when Jules
first brought me here.

383
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:52,776
That was ten years ago.

384
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,779

can be born at the same time.

my friend.

394

something better than that

for his long journey here

400

Well, if so, it is now.

Antique furniture,
and some of it not so antique.

425

next month.

it did not discourage him

The odd thing
is that we all stayed here.

587
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:35,591
- He sent me to a school there

588
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:37,424
where I learned everything
about furniture.

589
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:39,760

that to revive an interest
in Jules Gund and his work,

614
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:32,809
a biography
would be invaluable to us.

I could convince everyone.

all the little torments

I was utterly miserable,

but he, when in a system,
was in his element.

629
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:58,267
I suspect it was there at school
that he began to learn

over those who adored him.

When our mother... that is,

when our mother arrived here

When she arrived here,
she hid them away.

Because of her experiences
in Germany,

00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:47,911
she trusted no one.

00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:56,146
why, she and my father

very shortly after my father's,

701
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:02,088
I found the jewels.

702
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:05,095
- Do Arden and Oaroline know
about them?

703
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:06,096
- Nope.

704
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,098
They know nothing
of that history.

705
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:09,599
Even Oaroline
hardly knew my mother.

706
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:14,094
She certainly knew nothing
of what was precious to her.

707
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:15,935
So I took the jewels.

708
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:18,999
I felt I could assume
that they were mine

709
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:22,979
as Oaroline, in due course,
felt free to take what was hers.

710
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,538
- From what your mother left?

711
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:28,450
- With Oaroline,
it was what my brother left.

712
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:29,714
Have you never thought,

713
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:32,552
never suspected that
there might be another book?

714
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,784
<i>- Other than The Gondola?</i>

715
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:35,416
- Mm-hmm.

716
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:39,555
- It is well known, Jules Gund
wrote only that one book.

717
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:43,795
- Well, he was working
on another one when he died.

718
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:47,065
It is my theory that he died,
or killed himself,

719
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:50,301
because he couldn't...

720
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:52,138
couldn't write anymore.

721
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:53,734
Or because of what
he was writing

722
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:56,747
or trying to write.

723
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:58,442
A psychological impasse.

724
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:00,609
- Oaroline has the manuscript?

725
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:03,245
- I don't know.
You have to ask her.

726
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:04,652
But that is not the subject

727
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:06,850
of our present little talk,
is it?

728
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,085
My jewels.

00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:10,525
My need for money.

730
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,789
Ah, here's Pete.

731
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,437
Hail to thee!

732
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:57,674
[Motor rumbling]

733
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,241
Oome upstairs.
Follow me.

734
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,443
I want to show you something.

735
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,924
It is not for myself
that I need the money;

736
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,016
it is for Pete,

737
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:18,688
who may be free to leave me.

738
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:20,287
- Does he want to leave you?

739
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:21,559
- He should.

740
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,365
He still has a chance at
a better life than with me here.

741
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:27,530
You know, in order to bring him
here to Uruguay,

742
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:30,199
I had to adopt him.

743
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,471
Legally, he is my son.

744
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:42,614
Oome and sit down, please.

745
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:45,713
- I'll do what you ask.

746
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:47,951
- Even though it's illegal
and dangerous?

747
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,893
- I think
it's the right thing to do.

748
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:53,726
If you can trust me
not to screw it up.

749
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:55,629
- Ah, we shall see.

750
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,430
Please, sit down.

751
00:38:58,469 --> 00:38:59,629
So here's the treasure.

752
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,729
Some of it is mixed up
with my father's.

753
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:03,672
That's my father's watch.

754
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:06,108
Mother used to keep them
locked in the safe,

755
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:09,670
but sometimes she'd take it out
and wear it for me to show me.

756
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:10,874
And, uh...

757
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:14,248
I was her favorite, you know,
her firstborn,

758
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:16,344
her Adam, she called me.

759
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:17,445
[Chuckles]

760
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:20,184
Of course,
Jules could never get over that.

761
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:22,124
She would show me
how she wore them

762
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:25,356
and where.

763
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:27,762
This at the opera.

764
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:29,595
She had much smaller wrists
than mine.

765
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:31,760
- Wow.
- It's beautiful.

766
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:32,996
Go on, you can take it.

767
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:37,098
It's all right.

768
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:42,977
And these at the Burgtheater.

769
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:47,109
- [Chuckles]
- Isn't that beautiful?

770
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:50,848
Oh, yes, and this little horse
was for the races.

771
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:54,619
And she'd wear this
attached to her cloche hat.

772
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:57,650
[Bees buzzing]

773
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:28,815
[Knock at door]

774
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:31,419
- It's me, Omar Razaghi.

775
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:33,987
[Door squeaks open]

776
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:37,933
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

777
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:39,492
- I'm just having my breakfast.

778
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:42,700
Oome in.
[Loud cracking]

779
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:49,440
- Oh.
No, thank you.

780
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:00,186
- You don't have to say
anything nice about it.

781
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:01,748
- No, I like it.
It's very interesting.

782
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,384
- It's only a copy.

783
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:05,588
That's all I do nowadays,
is copies,

784
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,062
copy the masters.

785
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:08,325
It's safer.

786
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:11,562
That way,
I don't reveal anything.

787
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:13,627
It's what art does,

788
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:14,899
even biography.

789
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:16,873
Especially biography.

790
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:19,808
- I would be very discreet.

791
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:22,404
I would absolutely
respect your wishes

792
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:23,845
as to what to reveal.

793
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:33,580
- What if I were to tell you
that Jules explicitly said

794
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:37,287
he didn't want a biography
of himself?

795
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,592
He wrote it to me in a letter.

796
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,723
I suppose
you'd want to see that letter.

797
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:42,891
- Well, yes.

798
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:44,525
I'd like to very much.

799
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:46,502
- And why
would I show it to you?

800
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:49,005
I don't know anything about you,

801
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:54,443
no more than you know about me
or ever will.

802
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:58,574
What if I were to ask you,
have you ever been in love,

803
00:41:58,616 --> 00:42:02,450
passionately in love?

804
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:06,619
See, you can't answer me.

805
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:07,885
You're not sure.

806
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:09,290
- I am sure.

807
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:13,387
- Do you have a girlfriend?

808
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:14,727
A partner?

809
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:17,063
- Why do you want to know?

810
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:19,569
- Are you romantically involved?

811
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:21,537
- Yes.

812
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:23,130
I suppose I am.

813
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:24,470
- Suppose?

814
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:26,976
That doesn't sound very
positive, let alone passionate.

815
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:29,809
- We've been together two years.

816
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:32,577
Her name is Deirdre.

817
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:34,481
If it weren't for her,
I wouldn't be here.

818
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:38,420
I mean, here in Uruguay.

819
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:40,980
I would have accepted
your decision.

820
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:42,185
I would have given up.

821
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:45,320
- I see.

822
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:48,331
Sit.

823
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:51,892
So it is your friend Deirdre

824
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:54,131
who made you come
to change our minds.

825
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:55,763
And what if
you can't change our minds?

826
00:42:55,806 --> 00:42:57,000
What will she think?

827
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:59,305
She'll think you failed.

828
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:00,332
- Yes.

829
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:02,106
And she'd be right.

830
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:03,636
I will have failed.

831
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:05,546
- Sometimes it's good to fail,

832
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,107
to try but to fail.

833
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:08,812
There's nothing ignoble in that.

834
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:09,944
- You don't understand.

835
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:11,386
Everything depends on it:

836
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,287
My job, my career,

837
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:15,815
maybe my relationship
with my girlfriend.

838
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:22,390
- You're so young.

839
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,560
Are you sure that's
what you want your life to be

840
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:27,469
forever and ever:

841
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:30,496
That job, that career,

842
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:32,839
that girlfriend?

843
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:41,646
I'll show you
a real picture I painted.

844
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:44,153
It's Jules, only it's not him,

845
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:46,884
not as he really was,
which only I knew.

846
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:49,893
You don't see it
because I couldn't paint it.

847
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:54,921
I wasn't good enough
to paint it.

848
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:57,866
I suppose now you'll write
how the widow of Jules Gund

849
00:43:57,901 --> 00:43:59,892
is sitting
in a south American jungle

850
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:03,566
painting atrocious paintings
and slowly going mad

851
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:05,040
or not so slowly.

852
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:08,067
- I promise to write nothing
you don't want me to write.

853
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:10,103
- Point is,
I want you to write nothing.

854
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,842
- If you could just give me
one reason.

855
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:13,110
- I don't have a reason.

856
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,311
As anyone will tell you,
I am an unreasonable person.

857
00:44:15,352 --> 00:44:16,876
Jules himself
would have told you that

858
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:17,944
if he'd still been here.

859
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:20,115
In fact,
it's the very word he used

860
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:22,785
when he felt I wasn't
being accommodating enough

861
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,453
to his arrangements.

862
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,588
"You're so unreasonable,
Oaroline."

863
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:27,597
- I'm sorry.

864
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:29,030
I shouldn't have come here.

865
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:30,966
- Don't apologize.

866
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:33,401
No, it's good sometimes
to hear another voice.

867
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:34,426
I was beginning to think

868
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:35,995
that apart from
our little group here,

869
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,837
there was no one else
left in the world.

870
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:42,312
[Plaintive woodwind music]

871
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:50,344

872
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:55,348
[crickets and frogs chirping]

873
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:13,874
- Do you want to hear
how Arden met Jules?

874
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:15,071
- Yes.

875
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:17,376
- Omar doesn't want
to know that at all.

876
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:21,111
- He's writing a book;
he has to know everything.

877
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:24,450
- Mm-hmm.

878
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:28,891
- Um... I was traveling
around Spain

879
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:32,384
when I met some people
going to Uruguay.

880
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:34,454
So I went with them,

881
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:37,296
and they turned out
to be a missionary group

882
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:41,395
sent to convert
the heathen of south America.

883
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:43,065
[Both laugh]

884
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:44,938
- Don't laugh.

885
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:48,570
Our name was joyful noise.

886
00:45:48,612 --> 00:45:50,477
[Both laugh]

887
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:54,644
And we went around in a bus
and gave concerts in the street.

888
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:56,152
We never drew much of a crowd,

889
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:59,815
but people listened
very politely.

890
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:01,256
But by the time we'd finished,

891
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:03,919
there was usually
only one or two left.

892
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:07,021
But we went right on singing
and playing.

893
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:11,592
- Arden shook the tambourine.

894
00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:16,595
- Anyway, one day,
Jules stopped to listen.

895
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:21,202
And when we were through,
he came up to me and said,

896
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:22,769
"What are you doing?

897
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:25,281
And why are you doing it?"

898
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:27,044
So I stopped.

899
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:28,483
- And then I was born.

900
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:30,885
- Well,
not quite so quickly, darling.

901
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:32,980
- Nine months later, anyway.

902
00:47:17,901 --> 00:47:20,927
- I'm packing a picnic lunch.

903
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:24,099
- Why are you going on a picnic?

904
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:26,701
- I'm taking Omar
to show him the gondola.

905
00:47:26,743 --> 00:47:30,110
- Why?

906
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:32,047
As if that gondola

about the biography.

913
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:50,299
Why shouldn't he
write the biography?

914
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:51,631
He seems...

915
00:47:51,668 --> 00:47:54,967
he's just the right person
to understand Jules.

916
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:56,632
- In what way
is he the right person?

917
00:47:56,673 --> 00:47:58,800
Because he's good-looking
and charming

918
00:47:58,842 --> 00:48:01,902
and because he's charmed you?

919
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:05,574
What is it?

920
00:48:05,616 --> 00:48:07,106
I'm sorry.

921
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:11,086
It's just that what we decided
before still stands for me.

922
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:12,748
Maybe I shouldn't tell you this.

923
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:15,815
- Tell me what?

924
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:17,690
- Do you know
he's in love with someone?

925
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:23,332
- I didn't know that.

926
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:24,994
- He told me he has a fianc¨¦e.

927
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:26,093
Maybe they're not engaged,

928
00:48:26,136 --> 00:48:28,297
but he has
a romantic attachment.

929
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:30,932
- Why are you telling me this?

930
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:33,306
- Because I thought
you should know.

931
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:35,538
- It has nothing to do
with anything.

932
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:40,278
- I never said that it had,
but I wouldn't blame you.

933
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:41,477
You're lonely.

934
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:44,112
- I'm not lonely.

935
00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:46,281
Or maybe I am
and I didn't know it

936
00:48:46,323 --> 00:48:48,848
until there was a new person.

937
00:48:48,892 --> 00:48:54,057
When do we ever see anyone
or get to talk to anyone?

938
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:55,792
And now...

939
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:58,130
why are you talking to me
like this?

940
00:48:58,168 --> 00:48:59,829
Why do you want to hurt me?

941
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:02,998
- I don't want to hurt you.

942
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,668
I never wanted to hurt you.

943
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:08,405

944
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,709

You'll be coming with us?

947

Mmm.

949
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:24,154

It's a long way.

- Uh, well, if you're not
feeling up to it.

952
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:31,765
- Well, if you're not allowed
to write the biography,

953
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,531
there's no point in going.

954
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:36,038
And Oaroline
won't change her mind.

955

That's the way she is.

956
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:41,072
She has a much stronger
character than I have.

957
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:42,100
- That's not true.

958

- Oh, but it is.

959
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,708
Jules used to say that

960
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:48,206
any breeze could come
and blow me any which way.

961
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:51,015
But actually,
why shouldn't we go?

962
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:52,112
- Right.

the gondola.

She teaches
at the same university.

I shouldn't ask you

00:57:14,257 --> 00:57:15,224
- Oareful.

1087
00:57:15,258 --> 00:57:16,816
[Buzzing]

1088
00:57:16,859 --> 00:57:18,724
Omar.

1089
00:57:18,761 --> 00:57:19,728
- Ow!

1090
00:57:19,762 --> 00:57:21,389
- [Gasps]
- [Screaming]

1091
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:22,624
- Omar!
- Omar!

1092
00:57:22,665 --> 00:57:23,757
Thud!

1093
00:57:27,003 --> 00:57:28,129
- No!

1094
00:57:29,605 --> 00:57:31,197
- Omar?

1095
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,832
Omar.

1096
00:58:35,905 --> 00:58:38,897
[Soft beeping]

1097
00:59:36,899 --> 00:59:38,298
[Sighs]

1098
00:59:38,334 --> 00:59:40,802
Oh, Omar.

1099
00:59:40,836 --> 00:59:43,532
Omar, the doctor's
made a mistake.

1100
00:59:43,572 --> 00:59:46,063
He thinks I'm your girlfriend.

1101
00:59:49,145 --> 00:59:54,048
Oan you hear me?

1102
00:59:54,083 --> 00:59:58,713
Oan you feel me?

1103
00:59:58,754 --> 01:00:00,221
But it's all right.

1104
01:00:00,256 --> 01:00:03,555
I found Deirdre's phone number
in your book.

1105
01:00:03,592 --> 01:00:06,925
I left a message on her machine.

1106
01:00:06,962 --> 01:00:11,661
Maybe she'll come soon,
and then everything...

1107
01:00:11,701 --> 01:00:13,066
can you hear me?

1108
01:00:13,102 --> 01:00:15,832
Do you know what I'm saying?

1109
01:00:15,871 --> 01:00:19,568
Deirdre's coming.

1110
01:00:19,608 --> 01:00:21,940
Oh, please blink.

1111
01:00:25,781 --> 01:00:28,579
[Birds singing]

1112
01:00:28,617 --> 01:00:31,643
[Motor rumbling]

1113
01:00:49,171 --> 01:00:50,160
- No way.

1114
01:01:13,763 --> 01:01:15,287
[Grunts]

1115
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:24,931
[Engine turns over]

1116
01:01:24,974 --> 01:01:27,135
[Motor rumbling]

1117
01:01:27,176 --> 01:01:30,907
- Let me just show you
your bedroom and bathroom.

1118
01:01:30,946 --> 01:01:34,006
Did you know Omar was allergic
to bee sting?

1119
01:01:34,049 --> 01:01:35,243
- I did not.

1120
01:01:35,284 --> 01:01:39,050
But I'm not surprised.

1121
01:01:39,088 --> 01:01:42,182
[Shouting and whistling]

1122
01:01:42,224 --> 01:01:45,193
[Cattle lowing]

1123
01:01:45,227 --> 01:01:49,596
[Whooping and horses neighing]

1124
01:01:49,632 --> 01:01:51,099
- Are those gauchos?

1125
01:01:51,133 --> 01:01:52,225
- No.

1126
01:01:52,268 --> 01:01:54,532
Oh, yes.
Gauchos.

1127
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:58,438
Oowboys.

1128
01:01:58,474 --> 01:02:00,442
There's something
I must tell you.

1129
01:02:00,476 --> 01:02:01,909
No, thanks.

1130
01:02:01,944 --> 01:02:04,276
The doctor, Dr. Pereira,

1131
01:02:04,313 --> 01:02:08,807
he's taken very good care
of Omar, but, um...

1132
01:02:08,851 --> 01:02:12,048
he's made a silly mistake.

1133
01:02:12,087 --> 01:02:16,251
He thinks I'm Omar's lover.

1134
01:02:17,593 --> 01:02:18,719
- Oh.

1135
01:02:18,761 --> 01:02:20,592
- It's the sort of thing
he would think.

1136
01:02:20,629 --> 01:02:22,062
He's Latin American.

1137
01:02:22,097 --> 01:02:24,395
They see the world
in a certain way.

1138
01:02:24,433 --> 01:02:27,630
But I didn't correct him.

1139
01:02:27,670 --> 01:02:29,399
- Why not?

1140
01:02:29,438 --> 01:02:34,398
- As I said, Dr. Pereira
is the way men are here.

1141
01:02:34,443 --> 01:02:37,674
They like to think
of men and women involved,

1142
01:02:37,713 --> 01:02:40,045
romantically involved.

1143
01:02:40,082 --> 01:02:42,312
I thought that
if the doctor thinks that,

1144
01:02:42,351 --> 01:02:46,515
that Omar is loved...
that I love him...

1145
01:02:46,555 --> 01:02:50,355
then he would
take very special care of him.

1146
01:02:50,392 --> 01:02:51,416
- Moo!

1147
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:53,087
- But of course,
now that you're here...

1148
01:02:53,128 --> 01:02:55,528
- No, that's all right.

1149
01:02:55,564 --> 01:02:57,191
Whatever works best for Omar,

1150
01:02:57,233 --> 01:03:00,259
I don't care
what a doctor thinks.

1151
01:03:00,302 --> 01:03:02,429
Let him think I'm Omar's sister.

1152
01:03:02,471 --> 01:03:04,564
- Oh, you don't look
like his sister,

1153
01:03:04,607 --> 01:03:08,270
nothing like.

1154
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:11,279
[Cattle mooing loudly]

1155
01:03:11,313 --> 01:03:14,282
[Men whooping and hollering]

1156
01:03:14,316 --> 01:03:17,285
[Motor rumbling]

1157
01:03:17,319 --> 01:03:20,311
[Mooing and shouting continues]

1158
01:03:26,929 --> 01:03:28,726
- He's in this ward,

1159
01:03:28,764 --> 01:03:29,731
on the right.

1160
01:03:29,765 --> 01:03:30,891
I'll wait outside.

1161
01:03:30,933 --> 01:03:32,264
- Okay, thank you.

1162
01:04:03,232 --> 01:04:07,794
- Mm.

1163
01:04:07,836 --> 01:04:11,203
My god.

1164
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:13,868
Why are you here?

1165
01:04:13,909 --> 01:04:16,810
- Arden called me.

1166
01:04:16,845 --> 01:04:18,312
You were in a coma.

1167
01:04:23,752 --> 01:04:25,811
Has Arden been visiting you?

1168
01:04:25,854 --> 01:04:28,049
- Have you met her?

1169
01:04:28,090 --> 01:04:29,819
- Of course,
I'm staying in the house.

1170
01:04:29,858 --> 01:04:32,326
- Don't you like it?

1171
01:04:32,361 --> 01:04:33,851
Isn't it amazing,

1172
01:04:33,896 --> 01:04:37,059
the house and everything?

1173
01:04:37,099 --> 01:04:41,331
- Do you remember what happened?

1174
01:04:41,370 --> 01:04:44,498
With the bees?

1175
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:46,735
- No.

1176
01:04:46,775 --> 01:04:50,438
I don't remember anything
that happened that day clearly.

1177
01:04:57,319 --> 01:04:59,253
- Are you a friend
of our poor Omar?

1178
01:04:59,288 --> 01:05:01,518
- Yes, I'm very worried
about Omar.

1179
01:05:01,557 --> 01:05:02,751
- You must not worry.

1180
01:05:02,791 --> 01:05:04,452
You are too beautiful to worry.

1181
01:05:04,493 --> 01:05:08,122
All the women who visit Omar
are beautiful.

1182
01:05:08,163 --> 01:05:11,189
His recovery
has nothing to do with me.

1183
01:05:11,233 --> 01:05:14,031
It is the beauty of women
that cured him.

1184
01:05:35,090 --> 01:05:37,718
- Where did you
get these pajamas?

1185
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:38,954
- I don't know.

1186
01:05:38,994 --> 01:05:42,293
I woke up wearing them.

1187
01:05:42,331 --> 01:05:45,061
- Did Arden bring them?

1188
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:46,965
They may have belonged to Jules.

1189
01:05:47,002 --> 01:05:49,903
You are wearing
Jules Gund's pajamas.

1190
01:05:49,938 --> 01:05:51,769
[Both chuckle]

1191
01:05:51,807 --> 01:05:53,297
- Mmm.

1192
01:05:53,342 --> 01:05:56,072
- Do you think she's changed
her mind about authorization?

1193
01:05:56,111 --> 01:05:58,579
- Well, I'm not very sure
about Oaroline.

1194
01:05:58,614 --> 01:05:59,945
- We'll see about her.

1195
01:05:59,982 --> 01:06:01,415
What about Arden?

1196
01:06:01,450 --> 01:06:04,283
- She's leaning my way.

1197
01:06:04,319 --> 01:06:07,345
Our way.

1198
01:06:07,389 --> 01:06:09,448
- And the other one,
the brother?

1199
01:06:09,491 --> 01:06:11,789
- Adam?
- Mm-hmm.

1200
01:06:11,827 --> 01:06:13,522
- He's always been on my side.

1201
01:06:13,562 --> 01:06:15,530
And he says
he'll help me with Oaroline,

1202
01:06:15,564 --> 01:06:16,861
and I said I'd help him.

1203
01:06:16,899 --> 01:06:18,196
- Help him with what?

1204
01:06:18,233 --> 01:06:19,860
What can you help him with?

1205
01:06:19,902 --> 01:06:21,529
- It's nothing, really.

1206
01:06:21,570 --> 01:06:23,561
He just wants me
to carry something for him

1207
01:06:23,605 --> 01:06:25,470
when I go back to the States.

1208
01:06:25,507 --> 01:06:26,997
- Oarry what?

1209
01:06:27,042 --> 01:06:30,637
- Just some things.

1210
01:06:30,679 --> 01:06:32,510
- What things?

1211
01:06:32,548 --> 01:06:33,674
- Some...

1212
01:06:33,715 --> 01:06:35,649
pieces of jewelry.

1213
01:06:35,684 --> 01:06:38,016
Stuff like that.
[Clattering]

1214
01:06:38,053 --> 01:06:39,111
- Jewelry?

1215
01:06:39,154 --> 01:06:42,885
Did you say you would?

1216
01:06:42,925 --> 01:06:45,894
Omar, you're crazy.

1217
01:06:45,928 --> 01:06:47,156
It's smuggling.

1218
01:06:47,196 --> 01:06:48,788
He's asking you
to smuggle for him.

1219
01:06:48,831 --> 01:06:50,992
[Titters]
You'll go to jail.

1220
01:06:51,033 --> 01:06:53,126
- He wouldn't ask me
to do anything criminal.

1221
01:06:53,168 --> 01:06:54,260
He's not that type.

1222
01:06:54,303 --> 01:06:56,328
- Anyone who asks you
to take something

1223
01:06:56,371 --> 01:06:58,236
secretly out of the country
for him

1224
01:06:58,273 --> 01:07:00,070
is that type.

1225
01:07:00,109 --> 01:07:02,771
- He's been very helpful to me
with the biography.

1226
01:07:02,811 --> 01:07:04,005
And that's what I'm here for:

1227
01:07:04,046 --> 01:07:06,014
To get authorization
for the biography.

1228
01:07:06,048 --> 01:07:07,743
- This is not the way to get it.

1229
01:07:07,783 --> 01:07:09,808
- I'm doing it my way.
Everything's fine.

1230
01:07:09,852 --> 01:07:11,581
- Everything is not fine, Omar.

1231
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:13,645
If it were, I wouldn't be here.

1232
01:07:13,689 --> 01:07:14,849
- I didn't ask you to come here.

1233
01:07:14,890 --> 01:07:16,255
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1234
01:07:16,291 --> 01:07:19,192
I flew 5,000 miles
because you were in a coma.

1235
01:07:19,228 --> 01:07:20,252
A coma!

1236
01:07:20,295 --> 01:07:21,455
- Stop.

1237
01:07:21,497 --> 01:07:24,022
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

1238
01:07:24,066 --> 01:07:27,365
I just... I wish you wouldn't
treat me like a baby.

1239
01:07:27,402 --> 01:07:29,029
- Then don't act like a baby.

1240
01:07:29,071 --> 01:07:31,039
Don't agree to smuggle jewelry.

1241
01:07:31,073 --> 01:07:32,506
Don't fall out of a tree.

1242
01:07:32,541 --> 01:07:35,032
- Falling out of a tree
was an accident.

1243
01:07:35,077 --> 01:07:36,635
- You know what I think
about accidents.

1244
01:07:36,678 --> 01:07:39,044
- Accidents happen to people,
Deirdre.

1245
01:07:39,081 --> 01:07:42,983
We can't all be perfect
like you.

1246
01:07:43,018 --> 01:07:45,885
- I'm not perfect.

1247
01:07:45,921 --> 01:07:48,822
I know I'm not perfect.

1248
01:07:48,857 --> 01:07:50,119
I don't think I am.

1249
01:07:50,159 --> 01:07:52,389
I'm just trying
to help you, Omar,

1250
01:07:52,427 --> 01:07:56,557
because I love you.

1251
01:07:56,598 --> 01:07:58,532
You really wish I hadn't come?

1252
01:07:58,567 --> 01:08:01,536
- No.

1253
01:08:01,570 --> 01:08:02,901
- Because I can leave.

1254
01:08:02,938 --> 01:08:04,098
I can leave whenever you want.

1255
01:08:04,139 --> 01:08:05,766
- No.
[Sighs]

1256
01:08:05,807 --> 01:08:07,035
Want you to stay.

1257
01:08:15,651 --> 01:08:17,949
- Omar,
you've broken your wrist.

1258
01:08:17,986 --> 01:08:20,318
Let me wipe the soup
off your face.

1259
01:08:36,838 --> 01:08:38,237
- Adam!

1260
01:08:42,411 --> 01:08:45,312
- So how is
our poor young friend?

1261
01:08:45,347 --> 01:08:47,542
I hear he's recovering.

1262
01:08:47,583 --> 01:08:50,143
- His girlfriend has arrived

1263
01:08:50,185 --> 01:08:51,880
to comfort him,

1264
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:55,083
and hopefully
to take him home.

1265
01:08:55,123 --> 01:08:57,148
Where's Pete?

1266
01:08:57,192 --> 01:08:58,591
- Taking a shower.

1267
01:09:06,368 --> 01:09:08,768
So...

1268
01:09:08,804 --> 01:09:12,934
to what do I owe
this pleasure?

1269
01:09:12,975 --> 01:09:14,533
It really is a pleasure,
you know?

1270
01:09:23,719 --> 01:09:28,122
Well, here we are.

1271
01:09:28,156 --> 01:09:31,523
To the pleasure of you.

1272
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:36,361
- How sweet you are.

1273
01:09:36,398 --> 01:09:38,025
- Not bad.

1274
01:09:38,066 --> 01:09:39,033
Not bad at all.

1275
01:09:39,067 --> 01:09:40,864
Please, sit down.

1276
01:09:40,902 --> 01:09:42,893
- It's supposed to be
a cocktail.

1277
01:09:46,742 --> 01:09:48,209
- Oocktail.

1278
01:09:48,243 --> 01:09:50,711
What a lovely word.

1279
01:09:50,746 --> 01:09:52,441
If only one could drink it

1280
01:09:52,481 --> 01:09:54,381
where a cocktail
should be drunk,

1281
01:09:54,416 --> 01:09:56,475
sitting on a barstool

1282
01:09:56,518 --> 01:09:59,954
somewhere dark, secluded.

1283
01:09:59,988 --> 01:10:01,114
But liquor is liquor

1284
01:10:01,156 --> 01:10:02,680
wherever you go in the world,
isn't it?

1285
01:10:02,724 --> 01:10:05,557
- It's a Manhattan,

1286
01:10:05,594 --> 01:10:08,495
or half a Manhattan,
since you have no bourbon.

1287
01:10:08,530 --> 01:10:09,895
- A Manhattan.

1288
01:10:09,931 --> 01:10:12,161
That's your Moscow.

1289
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,224
Hmm?

1290
01:10:13,268 --> 01:10:15,236
"Oh, Olga, Olga,
let us go to Moscow.

1291
01:10:15,270 --> 01:10:17,500
There's no place in the world
like Moscow."

1292
01:10:20,942 --> 01:10:22,000
- Adam, I want to ask you,

1293
01:10:22,044 --> 01:10:23,773
do you think
I was wrong to stay here?

1294
01:10:23,812 --> 01:10:26,178
- What do you mean?

1295
01:10:26,214 --> 01:10:28,682
- You know what I mean.

1296
01:10:28,717 --> 01:10:32,244
When Jules came back
with Arden.

1297
01:10:32,287 --> 01:10:33,845
- I didn't judge you.

1298
01:10:33,889 --> 01:10:36,551
It was your affair and Jules'.

1299
01:10:36,591 --> 01:10:38,252
- She was so pathetic.

1300
01:10:38,293 --> 01:10:39,920
It was as if he'd picked up
a stray kitten

1301
01:10:39,961 --> 01:10:42,862
and brought it home,

1302
01:10:42,898 --> 01:10:44,559
a pregnant kitten.

1303
01:10:44,599 --> 01:10:46,760
- Yeah.

1304
01:10:46,802 --> 01:10:49,202
- Now I think she's changed
her mind about the biography,

1305
01:10:49,237 --> 01:10:50,602
as you have.

1306
01:10:50,639 --> 01:10:51,936
- I never opposed it.

1307
01:10:51,973 --> 01:10:52,940
Why should we?

1308
01:10:52,974 --> 01:10:54,942
A biography is nothing,

1309
01:10:54,976 --> 01:10:56,944
an account of the facts
written by,

1310
01:10:56,978 --> 01:11:00,106
well, just for all we know,
some academic hack.

1311
01:11:00,148 --> 01:11:01,809
Though I hope not.

1312
01:11:01,850 --> 01:11:03,875
Maybe he'll surprise us.

1313
01:11:03,919 --> 01:11:05,318
Poor boy.

1314
01:11:05,354 --> 01:11:06,878
What a thing to happen.

1315
01:11:06,922 --> 01:11:08,549
A bee, can you imagine?

1316
01:11:08,590 --> 01:11:10,319
- It's his own fault.

1317
01:11:10,359 --> 01:11:11,383
Why did he come here?

1318
01:11:11,426 --> 01:11:14,054
He has no business here,
hack or not.

1319
01:11:14,096 --> 01:11:17,224
- Supposing Jules
had written something himself.

1320
01:11:17,265 --> 01:11:19,733
Had he?

1321
01:11:19,768 --> 01:11:21,201
Yes, he had.

1322
01:11:21,236 --> 01:11:22,464
I thought so.

1323
01:11:22,504 --> 01:11:25,405
And it would have to be
personal, autobiographical,

1324
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,908
'cause Jules
was not an inventive writer.

1325
01:11:27,943 --> 01:11:30,241
<i>And as The Gondola
was about our parents' lives,</i>

1326
01:11:30,278 --> 01:11:31,905
this other manuscript...

1327
01:11:31,947 --> 01:11:33,744
- Which no longer exists.

1328
01:11:33,782 --> 01:11:35,579
- Which no longer exists...

1329
01:11:35,617 --> 01:11:39,747
would be about his life with you
and Arden in this place.

1330
01:11:39,788 --> 01:11:42,518
And for all I know,

1331
01:11:42,557 --> 01:11:45,924
even about Pete and me.

1332
01:11:45,961 --> 01:11:50,261
- How could any outsider
understand this place

1333
01:11:50,298 --> 01:11:54,132
or what it was like
to all live here together

1334
01:11:54,169 --> 01:11:57,696
or what it's like now
without him?

1335
01:11:57,739 --> 01:11:59,263
- Yes.

1336
01:12:01,576 --> 01:12:03,203
You know,
you could leave tomorrow

1337
01:12:03,245 --> 01:12:04,735
if you wanted to,

1338
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:06,873
any time you choose.

1339
01:12:06,915 --> 01:12:09,975
- You very well know,
I have no money.

1340
01:12:10,018 --> 01:12:12,213
How could I get
the fare together?

1341
01:12:12,254 --> 01:12:13,812
Don't you think I haven't
thought of it,

1342
01:12:13,855 --> 01:12:16,221
that I don't sit up there
pretending to paint,

1343
01:12:16,258 --> 01:12:19,557
brooding over
where I might be instead?

1344
01:12:19,594 --> 01:12:20,720
I need a real drink.

1345
01:12:20,762 --> 01:12:23,731
How about you?

1346
01:12:23,765 --> 01:12:25,392
Scotch.
- Yeah.

1347
01:12:25,434 --> 01:12:27,902
- Not getting very far
on just vermouth.

1348
01:12:27,936 --> 01:12:32,396
[Distant thunder crashes]

1349
01:12:32,441 --> 01:12:34,170
Adam, do you like life?

1350
01:12:34,209 --> 01:12:35,403
- [Chuckles]

1351
01:12:35,444 --> 01:12:38,072
Well, I wouldn't like
to live forever.

1352
01:12:38,113 --> 01:12:42,174
But um, for a little while,
yes, but...

1353
01:12:42,217 --> 01:12:44,344
yes, I like it.

1354
01:12:44,386 --> 01:12:45,978
- But living here?

1355
01:12:46,021 --> 01:12:47,579
You wouldn't rather
be somewhere else,

1356
01:12:47,622 --> 01:12:48,589
New York, London?

1357
01:12:48,623 --> 01:12:50,921
- No.
- Why not?

1358
01:12:50,959 --> 01:12:52,688
- Because you have
to care about...

1359
01:12:52,727 --> 01:12:55,753
or at least pretend to care
about everything:

1360
01:12:55,797 --> 01:12:58,197
Politics, fashion, culture.

1361
01:12:58,233 --> 01:12:59,598
It's just exhausting.

1362
01:12:59,634 --> 01:13:02,296
- What I wouldn't give
to see some new painters,

1363
01:13:02,337 --> 01:13:06,034
a new play, go to the opera.

1364
01:13:06,074 --> 01:13:08,599
Yes, I know.

1365
01:13:08,643 --> 01:13:11,407
To Moscow, Olga.

1366
01:13:11,446 --> 01:13:15,041
- Yeah.

1367
01:13:15,083 --> 01:13:16,744
This is a very potent drink.

1368
01:13:16,785 --> 01:13:20,084
Perhaps I should not
have indulged in a refill.

1369
01:13:23,859 --> 01:13:26,692
Tell me something.
Was there ever a letter?

1370
01:13:26,728 --> 01:13:27,820
Did Jules really write to you

1371
01:13:27,863 --> 01:13:29,626
saying he didn't want
a biography?

1372
01:13:29,664 --> 01:13:30,790
- No.

1373
01:13:30,832 --> 01:13:32,390
But I know
he wouldn't have wanted it.

1374
01:13:32,434 --> 01:13:33,401
- How would you know that?

1375
01:13:33,435 --> 01:13:34,993
- Because he destroyed
the manuscript.

1376
01:13:35,036 --> 01:13:36,560
[Thunder rumbling]

1377
01:13:36,605 --> 01:13:38,232
- He destroyed it himself?

1378
01:13:38,273 --> 01:13:39,570
- He wanted no one to know

1379
01:13:39,608 --> 01:13:42,406
what only concerned himself
and me.

1380
01:13:42,444 --> 01:13:44,241
So no matter
what you and Arden decide,

1381
01:13:44,279 --> 01:13:47,305
I shall never allow
this biography to be written,

1382
01:13:47,349 --> 01:13:49,613
even if he gets stung
by 100 bees.

[Rustling]

1384
01:14:01,329 --> 01:14:02,694
- Excuse me.

1385
01:14:02,731 --> 01:14:05,165
Oan you tell me the way
to the mill house, please?

1386
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:07,634
- You have to go back this way

1387
01:14:07,669 --> 01:14:11,696
and then
through the bamboo grove.

1388
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:12,968
- Through there.

1389
01:14:13,008 --> 01:14:14,066
- Thank you.

1390
01:14:18,914 --> 01:14:20,609
- What do you think of her?

1391
01:14:20,649 --> 01:14:22,549
- What do you?

1392
01:14:22,584 --> 01:14:25,644
- I don't see her with Omar,

1393
01:14:25,687 --> 01:14:27,120
her personality.

1394
01:14:27,155 --> 01:14:30,249
But I don't know either of them
very well.

1395
01:14:30,292 --> 01:14:32,453
What do you think?

1396
01:14:42,137 --> 01:14:44,571
Will you miss them
when they're gone?

1397
01:14:44,606 --> 01:14:46,631
- No.

1398
01:14:46,675 --> 01:14:48,734
- I mean Omar.

1399
01:14:48,777 --> 01:14:49,971
Will you miss Omar?

1400
01:14:54,616 --> 01:14:58,074
Do you love him?

1401
01:14:58,119 --> 01:15:01,577
- No.

1402
01:15:01,623 --> 01:15:07,391
No, I don't love Omar.

1403
01:15:07,429 --> 01:15:10,125
What?
Why did you ask me that?

1404
01:15:10,165 --> 01:15:13,293
Omar didn't say anything to you
about me

1405
01:15:13,335 --> 01:15:15,360
when you went to see him
in the hospital?

1406
01:15:15,403 --> 01:15:17,166
- No,
I just thought,

1407
01:15:17,205 --> 01:15:19,036
if I were you...

1408
01:15:19,074 --> 01:15:22,805
- If you were me, what?

1409
01:15:22,844 --> 01:15:24,869
- I might love him.

1410
01:15:24,913 --> 01:15:26,210

1411
01:15:26,247 --> 01:15:28,647
Well, it's as you said, Pete.

We hardly know him.

He's only been here
for a short time,

1414
01:15:32,687 --> 01:15:34,211
he has a girlfriend,

1415
01:15:34,255 --> 01:15:36,052
and he's leaving soon.

1416
01:15:36,091 --> 01:15:38,992
The doctor says he can travel
in a few days.

1417

They're both leaving.

01:15:41,262 --> 01:15:42,229

01:24:51,312 --> 01:24:53,712
I don't think you know much
about happiness, my friend.

1620
01:24:53,748 --> 01:24:55,010
- Do you?

1621
01:24:55,049 --> 01:24:57,574
- Oh, I gave up on all that
stuff a long time ago.

1622
01:24:57,618 --> 01:24:59,586
- You pretend you have.

1623
01:24:59,620 --> 01:25:02,180
Don't I make you happy,
at least sometimes?

1624
01:25:02,223 --> 01:25:03,850
- Yes, of course.

1625
01:25:03,891 --> 01:25:08,123
- So why are you trying
to send me away?

1626
01:25:08,162 --> 01:25:10,528
- Because I don't want you
wasting yourself on me.

1627
01:25:10,565 --> 01:25:13,193
I'm an old man,

1628
01:25:13,234 --> 01:25:16,260
"a paltry thing,
a tattered coat upon a stick."

1629
01:25:16,304 --> 01:25:18,204
Make a life for yourself,

1630
01:25:18,239 --> 01:25:20,867
for god's sake.

1631
01:25:20,908 --> 01:25:22,808
- Look at me.

1632
01:25:22,843 --> 01:25:24,310
Go on, look.

1633
01:25:24,345 --> 01:25:25,778
- I'm looking.

1634
01:25:25,813 --> 01:25:29,647
I'm 40 years old.

1635
01:25:29,684 --> 01:25:32,585
I've lived with you
for 25 years.

1636
01:25:34,755 --> 01:25:38,885
I don't want any other life.

1637
01:25:38,926 --> 01:25:41,827
- 25 years.

1638
01:25:41,862 --> 01:25:43,830
Hmm.

1639
01:25:43,864 --> 01:25:45,957
You're a sweet boy.

1640
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,264
And I've always loved you,
and I love you now.

1641
01:26:00,615 --> 01:26:04,210
- But there is someone
who needs money to leave.

1642
01:26:06,220 --> 01:26:08,017
- Oh, Oaroline, yes.

1643
01:26:12,226 --> 01:26:14,558
- Don't involve Omar in this.

1644
01:26:14,595 --> 01:26:15,892
- Hmm?

1645
01:26:15,930 --> 01:26:18,592
- I can get much better price
than he ever could.

1646
01:26:18,633 --> 01:26:21,602
If not in Montevideo,
then in Buenos Aires.

1647
01:26:21,636 --> 01:26:22,694
- You can?

1648
01:26:22,737 --> 01:26:23,704
How?

1649
01:26:23,738 --> 01:26:25,569
- I have contacts.

1650
01:26:25,606 --> 01:26:29,406
- So how much do you think
you will make with these?

1651
01:26:29,443 --> 01:26:32,378
- Enough for
where she wants to be.

1652
01:26:32,413 --> 01:26:34,847
- Really?

1653
01:26:34,882 --> 01:26:38,648
Supposing we exact
a small exchange with Oaroline.

1654
01:26:38,686 --> 01:26:41,985
Supposing the money
you make for her,

1655
01:26:42,023 --> 01:26:44,389
she takes the cash and leaves.

1656
01:26:44,425 --> 01:26:46,086
- Quite a bit of cash.

1657
01:26:46,127 --> 01:26:47,151
- Yes.

1658
01:26:47,194 --> 01:26:49,059
And in return
for that bit of cash,

1659
01:26:49,096 --> 01:26:50,825
we could make a bargain
with her.

1660
01:26:50,865 --> 01:26:52,833
I suggest
she might want to make over

1661
01:26:52,867 --> 01:26:57,736
her part of Ocho Rios
to you.

1662
01:26:57,772 --> 01:27:00,332
You'd be 1/3 partner
with Portia and myself,

1663
01:27:00,374 --> 01:27:01,500
and of course, as you know,

1664
01:27:01,542 --> 01:27:03,669
we're more accommodating
than Oaroline

1665
01:27:03,711 --> 01:27:06,839
and more used to signing things.

1666
01:27:06,881 --> 01:27:08,508
So perhaps you could,
if you want to,

1667
01:27:08,549 --> 01:27:12,110
start one of
your moneymaking schemes.

1668
01:27:12,153 --> 01:27:15,850
Thousands of acres of soybeans

1669
01:27:15,890 --> 01:27:19,053
blowing in the wind.

1670
01:27:19,093 --> 01:27:20,390
- My god.

1671
01:27:20,428 --> 01:27:23,886
How I'd make this place
work for us.

1672
01:27:23,931 --> 01:27:26,058
Oh.

1673
01:27:40,848 --> 01:27:42,907
- I'm going to Las Golondrinas
for a few days.

1674
01:27:42,950 --> 01:27:45,043
I just wanted you to know.
- Why?

1675
01:27:45,086 --> 01:27:46,747
- I don't feel comfortable here.

1676
01:27:46,787 --> 01:27:48,220
I want all these people
to go away.

1677
01:27:48,255 --> 01:27:50,780
But as they only incapacitate
themselves and multiply,

1678
01:27:50,825 --> 01:27:52,315
I'm going away myself.

1679
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:53,987
Oall me when the coast is clear.

1680
01:27:54,028 --> 01:27:55,825
- I'll do no such thing.

1681
01:27:55,863 --> 01:27:57,694
Go if you want,
but don't give me orders.

1682
01:27:57,732 --> 01:27:59,165
- Goodness.

1683
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,532
Sounds as if you're the one
who needs to get away from here.

1684
01:28:11,178 --> 01:28:12,202
- Oaroline.

1685
01:28:12,246 --> 01:28:13,975
- I wonder
if Luis can get me there.

1686
01:28:14,014 --> 01:28:17,347
<i>Esta b¨ªen, Lu¨ªs?
- A su d¨ªspos¨ªc¨ªon, senora.</i>

1687
01:28:17,385 --> 01:28:20,252
- Are you leaving
without talking to him,

1688
01:28:20,287 --> 01:28:21,413
to Omar?

1689
01:28:21,455 --> 01:28:22,422
Omar.

1690
01:28:22,456 --> 01:28:23,445
- Why should I talk to him?

1691
01:28:23,491 --> 01:28:24,583
I've talked a lot to him

1692
01:28:24,625 --> 01:28:28,618
and to his
rather unpleasant girlfriend.

1693
01:28:28,662 --> 01:28:31,187
- You're afraid that if you
stay, you'll change your mind.

1694
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:33,632
- I'm afraid if I stay,
I'll lose my mind.

1695
01:28:40,708 --> 01:28:42,471
- "My dear Oaroline,

1696
01:28:42,510 --> 01:28:44,637
"I have a confession to make.

Don't overdo it."

- Where is everyone?

- They're busy
doing whatever they do,

1723
01:30:12,266 --> 01:30:14,234
forging paintings,

1724
01:30:14,268 --> 01:30:16,236
raising killer bees, I guess,

1725
01:30:16,270 --> 01:30:17,931
and smuggling jewels.

1726
01:30:22,109 --> 01:30:23,633
- Well,
can you please go find them

1727
01:30:23,677 --> 01:30:25,440
and tell them we're back
from the hospital?

1728
01:30:31,285 --> 01:30:32,252
- Find whom?

1729
01:30:32,286 --> 01:30:35,915
- Arden... and everyone.

1730
01:30:35,956 --> 01:30:37,355
Oaroline.

1731
01:30:37,391 --> 01:30:38,983
- Oaroline.

1732
01:30:39,026 --> 01:30:41,290
You certainly
need to speak to Oaroline.

1733
01:30:47,234 --> 01:30:48,462
[Knocks]

1734
01:30:57,311 --> 01:30:58,801
- What are you drawing?

- Are you finished?

1736
01:31:16,430 --> 01:31:17,488
I'm sorry, Portia,

1737
01:31:17,531 --> 01:31:19,590
but I need to talk to Omar.

1738
01:31:24,538 --> 01:31:26,438
[Whispers]
Run along.

1739
01:31:27,942 --> 01:31:29,239
Oan you believe it?

1740
01:31:29,276 --> 01:31:30,868
Oaroline has left.

1741
01:31:30,911 --> 01:31:34,506
And without a word to us
about the authorization.

1742
01:31:34,548 --> 01:31:36,413
I'll have to go after her
and speak to her.

1743
01:31:36,450 --> 01:31:40,011
I think she's enjoying this.

1744
01:31:40,054 --> 01:31:42,284
[Whispers]
These people are awful.

1745
01:31:42,323 --> 01:31:47,693
- If anyone speaks to Oaroline,
it'll have to be me.

1746
01:31:47,728 --> 01:31:51,596
- I think I might be better
at handling a person like that.

1747
01:31:51,632 --> 01:31:53,395
- I don't want to handle anyone.

1748
01:31:53,434 --> 01:31:56,926
I hate that attitude.

1749
01:31:56,971 --> 01:31:59,439
- Omar,

1750
01:31:59,473 --> 01:32:01,065
what's the matter with you?

1751
01:32:06,747 --> 01:32:09,648
I'm sorry.

1752
01:32:09,683 --> 01:32:12,015
I'm sorry, you've been ill.

1753
01:32:12,052 --> 01:32:15,852
You've only just
come out of the hospital.

1754
01:32:15,889 --> 01:32:17,948
You're not yourself.

1755
01:32:17,992 --> 01:32:19,721
And really,
you're not in a fit state

1756
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:21,523
to go running
after crazy Oaroline.

1757
01:32:21,562 --> 01:32:23,723
- Please, Deirdre,

1758
01:32:23,764 --> 01:32:25,197
leave it to me.

- Darling...

- Would you just let me rest?

[Indistinct shouting
and splashing]

1762
01:33:15,315 --> 01:33:16,976
- Omar, "Las Golondrinas"

1763
01:33:17,017 --> 01:33:20,544
means little birds
that fly and sing.

1764
01:33:20,587 --> 01:33:25,047
That is what we do here,
as you can see.

1765
01:33:25,092 --> 01:33:28,152
Jules was always welcome here.

1766
01:33:28,195 --> 01:33:30,891
He lived with his two women
at Ocho Rios,

1767
01:33:30,931 --> 01:33:35,391
and sometimes
he had to come up for air...

1768
01:33:35,436 --> 01:33:38,234
when Oaroline
was too much for him.

1769
01:33:38,272 --> 01:33:39,967
- And Arden was too little.

1770
01:33:43,944 --> 01:33:45,309
- Don't you want to swim?

1771
01:33:45,345 --> 01:33:46,972
We have plenty of suits.

01:33:47,014 --> 01:33:48,311
Yes?

01:33:48,348 --> 01:33:50,908
You don't have to put that arm
in the water, no?

[Shouting and splashing]

1780
01:34:05,799 --> 01:34:09,963
Jules was very, very attractive.

1781
01:34:10,003 --> 01:34:11,868
And depressive, of course.

1782
01:34:11,905 --> 01:34:14,533
But that made him
even more attractive,

1783
01:34:14,575 --> 01:34:17,703
like Hamlet
or someone out of Dostoyevsky.

1784
01:34:17,745 --> 01:34:19,212
[Chuckles]

1785
01:34:19,246 --> 01:34:22,875
He had the knack
of making each woman he met

1786
01:34:22,916 --> 01:34:27,148
feel she was the only one
who truly understood him.

1787
01:34:27,187 --> 01:34:28,449
Only women.

1788
01:34:28,489 --> 01:34:29,888
He didn't care for men,

1789
01:34:29,923 --> 01:34:32,289
nor they for him.

1790
01:34:32,326 --> 01:34:35,227
And he was writing this book,

1791
01:34:35,262 --> 01:34:38,425
another book
to make him even more famous.

1792
01:34:38,465 --> 01:34:39,830
We thought it was thrilling.

1793
01:34:39,867 --> 01:34:42,097
Perhaps we were all in it.

1794
01:34:42,136 --> 01:34:45,902
And each one of us
thought she was his muse.

1795
01:34:45,939 --> 01:34:48,772
And would go down in history,
no?

1796
01:34:55,048 --> 01:34:58,916
- God knows
what she's telling him.

1797
01:34:58,952 --> 01:35:00,442
Every woman who ever met Jules

1798
01:35:00,487 --> 01:35:04,184
is convinced she understood him
better than I did,

1799
01:35:04,224 --> 01:35:06,556
or Arden, for that matter.

1800
01:35:06,593 --> 01:35:09,960
- You know what I think?

1801
01:35:09,997 --> 01:35:13,296
That he wasn't writing a book
at all.

1802
01:35:13,333 --> 01:35:15,301
He was talking about it

1803
01:35:15,335 --> 01:35:17,633
to impress us,

1804
01:35:17,671 --> 01:35:20,640
but he found he couldn't.

1805
01:35:20,674 --> 01:35:25,043
And that made him...

1806
01:35:25,078 --> 01:35:26,545
he couldn't bear the thought

1807
01:35:26,580 --> 01:35:29,981
of not being
a celebrated author anymore.

1808

if you can.

- Deirdre anyway,
will be pleased.

1833
01:36:49,096 --> 01:36:51,894
- But what about Jules' letter
that he didn't want a biography?

1834
01:36:51,932 --> 01:36:53,331
- Jules never wrote
such a letter.

1835
01:36:53,367 --> 01:36:55,562
I made that up.

1836
01:36:55,602 --> 01:36:58,901
But he did try
and write a second book.

1837
01:36:58,939 --> 01:37:01,203
There is a manuscript.
It does exist.

1838
01:37:01,241 --> 01:37:05,041
No one's ever read it except me.

1839
01:37:05,078 --> 01:37:06,102
Jules never finished it.

1840
01:37:06,146 --> 01:37:08,580
He couldn't.

1841
01:37:08,615 --> 01:37:11,516
Shall I tell you
about the last scene?

1842
01:37:11,551 --> 01:37:14,850
The last he wrote
and then he couldn't go on?

1843
01:37:14,888 --> 01:37:18,346
In this last scene, Arden and I
are in the gondola,

1844
01:37:18,392 --> 01:37:21,293
and we loathe each other
as we never did.

1845
01:37:21,328 --> 01:37:23,819
Though, perhaps
that's what he was waiting for.

1846
01:37:23,864 --> 01:37:25,354
But in the gondola,

1847
01:37:25,399 --> 01:37:27,526
we have a terrible fight,

1848
01:37:27,567 --> 01:37:28,966
a physical fight.

1849
01:37:29,002 --> 01:37:31,630
And I push Arden overboard.

1850
01:37:31,672 --> 01:37:32,866
But you know what?

1851
01:37:32,906 --> 01:37:34,897
The water isn't deep enough.

1852
01:37:34,942 --> 01:37:38,639
So I keep on pushing her down
and down.

1853
01:37:38,679 --> 01:37:41,204
- Did you intend to publish it?

1854
01:37:41,248 --> 01:37:43,148
- There were times
when I felt that I had to,

1855
01:37:43,183 --> 01:37:45,549
that it was a responsibility,
a duty,

1856
01:37:45,585 --> 01:37:48,816
to literature, if that
doesn't sound too grandiose.

1857
01:37:48,855 --> 01:37:52,552
- I don't believe
any of us has such a duty.

1858
01:37:52,592 --> 01:37:55,390

takes its life from us,

not the other way around.

1860
01:37:57,097 --> 01:38:00,089
- Is this the belief
of a professor of literature?

1861
01:38:00,133 --> 01:38:04,832
- Oh, I'm afraid
this is the other Omar,

who burned all the books.

the entire library of Alexandria

1864

1865
01:38:12,279 --> 01:38:15,214
700,000 papyrus scrolls.

1866
01:38:15,248 --> 01:38:17,842
It took six months
to burn them all up.

1933
01:43:38,905 --> 01:43:42,739

extraordinary times.

2006

- Oh.

2015
01:47:56,462 --> 01:47:57,895
Well, quite frankly,
it seemed to me

2016
01:47:57,931 --> 01:47:58,898
that it was, um...

2017
01:47:58,932 --> 01:48:00,229
What was her name?
Deirdre.

2018

It seemed to me
that it was Deirdre's project

2019
01:48:02,302 --> 01:48:04,770
more than it was yours.

2020

2021

I lost a dog.

2022

And searching for it,
I nearly drowned in a swamp.

2023
01:48:12,478 --> 01:48:14,343
And then it happened again.

2024
01:48:14,380 --> 01:48:15,779
I lost a dog.

2025
01:48:15,815 --> 01:48:19,342
The same dog, Victor.

2026
01:48:19,385 --> 01:48:22,115
And looking for him,
I came to the same swamp,

2027
01:48:22,155 --> 01:48:25,522
and I thought, "Oh, no.
No, not again."

2028
01:48:25,558 --> 01:48:27,458
But I was sinking,

2029
01:48:27,493 --> 01:48:30,519
not in that swamp
but in the biography,

of what you're talking about,
dear boy,

all the way back here

to save yourself from sinking.

2035
01:48:39,238 --> 01:48:40,227
Welcome.

2036
01:48:40,273 --> 01:48:42,036
- Arden told me to leave.

2037
01:48:42,075 --> 01:48:43,542
She said
I had no right to come here.

2038
01:48:43,576 --> 01:48:45,476
- Oh, we're always saying
things we don't mean,

2039
01:48:45,511 --> 01:48:47,035
especially in this family.

2040
01:48:47,080 --> 01:48:49,708
In fact, we often say
the opposite of what we do mean.

2041
01:48:49,749 --> 01:48:52,217
- Adam sends me away every day.

2042
01:48:52,251 --> 01:48:53,980
He says it's better that way.

2043
01:48:54,020 --> 01:48:55,749
- Yes, "It's better that way,"
which means,

2044
01:48:55,788 --> 01:48:57,551
I can't bear it, but I will.

- Go and see her again.

2048
01:49:01,561 --> 01:49:03,392
- But what if she tells me
to leave again?

2049
01:49:03,429 --> 01:49:05,920
- Then come back here
and tomorrow try again,

2050
01:49:05,965 --> 01:49:09,264

and the day after that.

They all seem very happy.
