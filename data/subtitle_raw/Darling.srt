1
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,939
This is Dr Lemaire.

2
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,974
The woman you brought me today...

3
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,772
What happened?

4
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,535
Jesus!

5
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,769
She's not a woman inside -
she looks more like ground beef.

6
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,289
Head injuries, internal hemorrhaging,
intestinal blockage.

7
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,218
It's bound to get infected.

8
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,337
Signs of old injuries
and more recent ones.

9
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,815
She won't go
to the hospital or police.

10
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,019
I don't know
how she survived it all.

11
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,134
One more thing...

12
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,934
She had feathers
and stones in her buttocks.

13
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,055
That's right. Stones.

14
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,739
Stones in her ass.

15
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,730
No, not kidney stones.

16
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,857
She said she was bewitched.

17
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,653
Name's Catherine Nicolle,

18
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,930
but call me Darling.

19
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,093
That's me, aged 9.

20
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,335
I was conceived here,
against the tree.

21
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,492
My parents met
when taking a cow to a bull.

22
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,255
Dad worked for Hervieu
who had a bull.

23
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,977
Mom worked at Fichepoil
who had a cow in heat.

24
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,857
So, Mom brought her cow.
Dad tied it to the tree.

25
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,250
They coupled the bull and the cow

26
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,735
and then, did likewise themselves.

27
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,773
I was born on the day

28
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,656
of the big cattle market.

29
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,090
My fetus's foot kicked a cow

30
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,973
and caused panic all around.

31
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,490
Hundreds of cows
and dozens of people were crushed.

32
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,933
I'm afraid of cows.

33
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,169
That evening,
Mom got stomach cramps

34
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,099
from all the cider she'd drunk
and said...

35
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,097
I hate this baby inside me.

36
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,609
She called the doctor, pushed hard,

37
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,458
and I plopped out.

38
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:30,857
Dad said...

39
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,736
Shit! A girl!

40
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,297
They already had 2 boys...

41
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,139
Joseph and Henri.

42
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,808
Wherever I went,
things turned to shit.

43
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,619
My first time at church,

44
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,376
the priest died during the sermon.

45
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,299
I was only little.

46
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,651
Why didn't you go to church,
you disobedient girl?

47
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,612
The priest saw me and died.

48
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,094
Bullshit!

49
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,060
- It's true!
- Stop telling stories.

50
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,171
It's true. He saw me and died.

51
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,575
So, Mrs Barrot bought me this.

52
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,453
That's the last time
I take you to market!

53
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,139
He didn't believe me.

54
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,335
And as I was drinking
from the bottle, it cut my lip.

55
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,616
There's not a single part of my body
that isn't scarred.

56
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,612
People never believe me.

57
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,372
It's like when I say
Maurice Chevalier killed Nixon.

58
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,811
You don't believe me, either.

59
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,413
But it's true.

60
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,613
Hurry up.

61
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,334
He's Maurice Chevalier.

62
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,529
You OK?

63
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,409
He was Nixon.

64
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,570
I thought I'd run you over.

65
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,218
I can do it, Dad.

66
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,328
Smack her ass!

67
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,890
You can help me tie up her leg.

68
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,179
- What've you done?
- I did what you said.

69
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,456
You can catch her now, you jerk!

70
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,218
He did the slip knot wrong.

71
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,171
The sow squealed her head off.

72
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,775
She doesn't want to croak here?

73
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,335
Nor do I.

74
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,490
Where have you gone, Joseph?

75
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,212
Come back to us.

76
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,136
Suzanne!

77
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,336
- What is it?
- A fit.

78
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,775
Henri!

79
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,650
Call the doctor! Quick!

80
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,171
He was having an epileptic fit.

81
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,098
It runs in the family.

82
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,810
My paternal grandfather had it,
and my son will have it.

83
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,648
That day, I began to hear
the highway's hum more clearly.

84
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,696
This was the pigs' swill.

85
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,255
I had to do it morning and night.

86
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,932
To me, these cabbages
were peasants' heads.

87
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,170
I won't be a farmer's wifey!

88
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,818
I won't be a farmer's wifey!

89
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,770
Take me with you, Mrs Clément.

90
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,096
- Where to?
- To work with you.

91
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,052
You're too young to work.

92
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,852
It's all I do on the farm.

93
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,530
I hear you can't read and count.

94
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:11,971
So?

95
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,535
You can't read the names of cakes.

96
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,134
Get off the road.

97
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,456
- Hello, Mrs Nicolle.
- Hello, Mrs Clément.

98
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,172
Scram! I'll tell your dad.

99
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,288
Here...

100
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:27,811
Thank you.

101
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,453
Go on, Barrel-Chest!

102
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,818
She's such a pain!

103
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,694
You're so lucky not to have kids.

104
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,488
What's a teepee
with a line through it?

105
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,009
An ''A''.

106
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,295
Oh, yeah...

107
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,975
Elle & Vire cream...

108
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,699
7 years of hidings.

109
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,497
I don't get it.

110
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,012
The jerk who stole my mirror
brought it back.

111
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,849
Isn't that weird?

112
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,854
It's witchcraft.

113
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,860
You better call
Joséphine, the exorcist.

114
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,699
What're you laughing at?

115
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,888
Are you done?

116
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,974
Go get dressed.

117
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,577
Barrel-Chest has dirtied her clothes
before school.

118
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,050
Hey, what's an 8 and a zero?

119
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,533
It's 80.

120
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,769
Oh, yeah...

121
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,250
Why are you suddenly interested?

122
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,493
To get away.

123
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,219
You want to go, too?

124
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,096
I'm joining the Navy in Cherbourg.

125
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:12,971
I'll fight

126
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,617
as far away as possible.

127
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,977
I'm going to get in a truck

128
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,774
and go the other way.
We can drop you off.

129
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,256
Why do you both want to go?

130
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:31,372
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

131
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,935
C, D, E, F...

132
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,889
Catherine...

133
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,056
Let's go see your mother.

134
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,812
My mother packed my bags.

135
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,534
I spent
the 6 happiest years of my life.

136
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,732
It hadn't been much till then.

137
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,691
But it got hellish later on.

138
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,296
In the meantime, it was a break.

139
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,015
Be light
when you knead the dough.

140
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,575
You're not at the farm here,
making swill.

141
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,213
You're making pastry.

142
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,694
If you're gentle

143
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,778
it will be airy
and make delicious cakes.

144
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,413
Sprinkle more flour
so the dough doesn't stick.

145
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,691
Up in the air! A cloud!

146
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,538
With your fingers!

147
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,849
'Night, beautiful.

148
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,215
'Night.

149
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,453
I wasn't beautiful,
but it was nice to hear.

150
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,458
Kids called me Double-Chin.

151
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,536
You've left lots.

152
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,089
Go do your room
since you lock it.

153
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,533
Why does she lock it?

154
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,298
It's my room!

155
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,652
You're hardly ever in it.

156
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,812
Why did you go to the baker's?

157
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:59,689
'Cause I'm bored here.
I'd rather work than stay with you!

158
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,697
Stop it or he'll get angry.

159
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,334
And my ears and my head will hurt.

160
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,575
I'll go do my room.

161
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,771
Can I have gym shorts for Monday?

162
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,289
Use Joseph's.
He's excused from gym.

163
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,331
An ''O-pé-ra''.

164
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,699
That's it.

165
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,259
Anything else?

166
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,174
Here, beautiful.

167
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,459
Hello.

168
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,137
8.60, please.

169
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,412
Sure you had enough sleep?!

170
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,175
I'm talking to you!

171
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,140
I get up at 3 AM all week.

172
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,658
I'm allowed to sleep in.

173
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,698
I don't get to sleep in!

174
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,132
Do what you like.

175
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,932
Everyone does what they like.

176
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,175
Where are you going?

177
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,649
Where you going?

178
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,733
Forget something?

179
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,529
What?

180
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,369
Today?

181
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,056
- What's today?
- Dunno.

182
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,533
We not good enough now?

183
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,212
Your father's birthday...

184
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,890
Is it too much
to say happy birthday?

185
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,455
You're never here!

186
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,210
- Are we nothing to you now?
- Happy birthday, Dad!

187
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,849
Happy birthday, Dad!
Many happy returns!

188
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,370
I crawled into the yard
to wait for Monday to come.

189
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,580
I need a cloth.
Can you lend me a cloth?

190
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,054
I'll return it tomorrow.

191
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,488
What for?

192
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,616
Mrs Clément, quick!

193
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,853
Didn't your mom explain?

194
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,132
She cares more about her flowers
than her kids.

195
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,854
She has hundreds of flowers
she tends to.

196
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,096
She's a florist, not a mother!

197
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,451
I'll look after my kids properly.

198
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,379
I'd have loved a girl like you.

199
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,934
- Don't you bleed?
- No.

200
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,013
Put this on.

201
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,572
It'll hide the cloth
sticking out of your shorts.

202
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,814
What are those marks?

203
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,897
A souvenir of the weekend.

204
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,052
What're you doing here?

205
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,330
- It's not Saturday.
- I'm busy.

206
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,770
- What with?
- Gotta leave something.

207
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,938
What're you leaving?

208
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,539
Off she goes again!

209
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:38,173
The more Barrel-Chest ran,
the thinner she got.

210
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,696
The more I ate,
the more I shrank.

211
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,417
My rage made me lose pounds
and aged my body.

212
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,613
Daydreaming, Catherine?

213
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,139
No, I'm OK.

214
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,217
Help me with the pastries.

215
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,014
It's time for me
to go on the street.

216
00:16:59,220 --> 00:16:59,811
Let's go.

217
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,010
I loved everything about her:

218
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,619
her body,

219
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,253
her smell,

220
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,688
her voice.

221
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,289
Everything.

222
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:40,248
He must love you
to do that every day!

223
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,818
A farmer? Never!

224
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:43,691
Why not?

225
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,415
I'll only marry a trucker.
It's that or nothing!

226
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,132
What a goddam mess!

227
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,009
Just look at it.

228
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,336
She's never tidied up a thing.

229
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,775
Search the table. I'll look here.

230
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,658
Under the bed...

231
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,249
Nothing.

232
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,931
- Georges, look.
- What?

233
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,292
What are they?

234
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,132
What the...?

235
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,376
Who taught her to write like that?

236
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,616
Joseph did ages ago.

237
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,051
What a strange girl.

238
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,772
One pastry ball.

239
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,369
A croissant.

240
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,013
Butter or margarine?

241
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,255
Butter.

242
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,571
One butter croissant.

243
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,416
- Anything else?
- A cheese stick.

244
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,537
One cheese stick.

245
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,853
An apple turnover.

246
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,255
I can do a selection if you like.

247
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,818
At this rate,
there'll be nothing left.

248
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:26,691
A waffle.

249
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,498
Oh, yes, a waffle.

250
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,970
One waffle.

251
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,689
Anything else?

252
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,856
It was like that every day.

253
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,818
I didn't like him,

254
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:42,410
but he was the first
to pay attention to my voice.

255
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,658
There were many others.

256
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,333
Hello.

257
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,249
Mom!

258
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,931
I need a new pair of shorts.
I'm not 12 anymore.

259
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,131
I don't like wasting money.

260
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,576
It's OK, it still fits you.

261
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,574
I'll buy a bigger pair
at the market.

262
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,615
Holy cow!

263
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,374
I'll wait a while.
I can't go out in this.

264
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,769
Really?

265
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,372
Well, I'm late. I'm going anyway.

266
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,332
- Not eating?
- No.

267
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,179
Fuck me!

268
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,217
What was that?

269
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,012
The earth moved!

270
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,336
I must tell Mrs Clément.

271
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,531
Why are you back so soon?

272
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,054
Where have you been?

273
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,773
I have absolutely no idea!

274
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,936
I ran straight, and here I am.

275
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,298
- What about school?
- Tomorrow. I'm beat!

276
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,970
I won't go to the Cléments yet.

277
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,570
I've got blisters from running.

278
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,611
- On your feet?
- No.

279
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,536
Those shorts are too small.

280
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,731
You can't get upstairs in them.

281
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,137
I'll try and buy a new pair.

282
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,978
No, don't go spending money.

283
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:12,092
I couldn't wish
for a better pair of shorts.

284
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,850
You were right.
I should listen to you more often.

285
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,778
Is she making fun of me?

286
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:37,735
I dreamed about it all night,
snoring my head off.

287
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,258
She's decided to shame us.

288
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,412
I ran for miles in them,

289
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,457
and in all weathers.

290
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,935
But other than pulled muscles,

291
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,818
nothing happened again.

292
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,139
What are those bruises?

293
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,369
Nothing.

294
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,177
What? How did you do them?

295
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,573
I don't know.

296
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,572
You don't know?

297
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,089
What is it?

298
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,419
It's Joseph.

299
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,133
He's turned mean.

300
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,978
Promise not to do anything.

301
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,090
What?

302
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,490
He calls everyday
with terrible stories,

303
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,816
then he shows up when you're out.

304
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,768
Tell him to come.

305
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:15,173
Joseph grew up
with his epileptic fits.

306
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:19,896
He couldn't get in the Navy.
That's what made him mean.

307
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,613
You wanted to talk to me, old girl?

308
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,736
- No, Dad, don't!
- Get off, lad.

309
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,056
It's OK, you won't get a migraine.

310
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,332
Now, get lost, you.

311
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,534
Don't call or come back
or you're dead.

312
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,971
Are you Joseph Nicolle's father?

313
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,136
Yes. Who is this?

314
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,411
Montebourg police station.

315
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,255
Well, now...

316
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,095
I'm afraid
your son has hung himself.

317
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,574
He hung himself
from a telegraph pole.

318
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,259
He did a slip knot.

319
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,649
Mr Nicolle, are you still there?

320
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,816
Stay there. We'll call you back.

321
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,773
My sympathy
for the loss of your beloved son.

322
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,297
Joseph's killed himself.

323
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:12,415
Joseph had phoned,
pretending to be a policeman.

324
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:15,851
He'd altered his voice.
Dad didn't recognize him.

325
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,336
He described his suicide in detail,

326
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,178
then he came and did it

327
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,132
from the pole just outside.

328
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,059
His idea of revenge.

329
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,255
It made me sad.

330
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,016
He liked the smell of my room.

331
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,729
Henri, the younger son, was next.

332
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:42,138
They say
that once death enters a house,

333
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,252
it comes right back
as if it had the key.

334
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,298
Stop! That's my sister.

335
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,417
- What?
- He said to stop.

336
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,095
Is he dead?

337
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,417
I'll never forget that image:

338
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:38,457
Henri with a scaffolding tube
through his head.

339
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,810
Like a table football player!

340
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,291
To think he always had earache!

341
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,493
Suzanne!

342
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,414
Two children...

343
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,059
Poor Mom.

344
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,619
Joseph's death
had already driven her crazy.

345
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,974
I was knocked out.

346
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,698
For once a truck I waved at
stopped.

347
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,493
Listen, Mr Nicolle,

348
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,772
you should tell your wife
to leave the pole alone.

349
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,977
It interferes with the calls.

350
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,693
Well, I'll be going.

351
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,815
So?

352
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:53,818
Why don't you want me to go
with the Cléments when they move?

353
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:58,810
Your brothers didn't have any luck.
Why should you?

354
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,859
Is that a reason?

355
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:13,413
If you don't let me go,
I'll poke my eyes out!

356
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,378
Bunch of assholes!

357
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,299
Bunch of assholes!

358
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:49,897
Since my brothers died,
Mother hated me even more.

359
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,978
''You killed Henri!''she'd say.

360
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:55,616
''If it wasn't for you,
the truck wouldn't have braked!''

361
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:59,859
And I'd say, ''What about Joseph?
Who denounced him? Not me!''

362
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,658
I'm going to rot here,

363
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,379
along with my dreams.

364
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,170
Why won't you see
the Blandamour boy?

365
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,017
He came to clean the cowshed

366
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,097
and looked all over for you.

367
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,773
You won't do better.

368
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,973
No farmers!

369
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,414
Look at her.

370
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,850
So snobby now she makes cakes!

371
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,614
Reading about pop stars
has gone to her head.

372
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,129
Take a good look at yourself!

373
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,699
A fine singer you'd make!

374
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:52,689
Apart from that lad, you'll be
nothing but dust in men's eyes!

375
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,174
Never a farmer's wifey!

376
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,291
We'll see about that.

377
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,649
Where you going?

378
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,210
No more sleeping in
all day for you.

379
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:08,176
I mentioned you to my boss.

380
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,658
- You're seeing him tomorrow.
- Tuvache?

381
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,499
Working with animals?

382
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,618
With truckers.

383
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,535
Hello.

384
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,088
This is Catherine.

385
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,972
Hello, sir.

386
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,376
Your ma said you caused chaos

387
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,969
at the cattle market.
Is that true?

388
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,649
Well, I don't know.

389
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,019
Don't do that here -
keep your head down.

390
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,778
Do you go to bed late?
I don't want a party girl

391
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,858
who can't get up early.

392
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,809
She's in bed early.

393
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:00,174
And on Sundays,
she paints red flowers

394
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,375
on her bedroom wall.

395
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,256
Oh, I love art, me!

396
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,818
See these paintings?

397
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:10,374
You be careful when you clean them.

398
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,532
Will you do me a painting?

399
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:16,618
Sure, she'll do you a flower,
won't you?

400
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,538
Have to wait till next month.

401
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:21,732
- Why's that?
- Georges, you know nothing of art.

402
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,934
Inspiration comes when it comes.

403
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,890
Turn around. Let me look at you.

404
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,255
Got a boyfriend?

405
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,090
The Blandamour boy's after her.

406
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,610
That'd be great for you, Nicolle!

407
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,333
You look strong enough.

408
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,579
Muscular arms.

409
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,339
Big calves.

410
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,339
Do you do sports?

411
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,814
A bit of running.

412
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,495
Yes, so I heard. Waving your arms!

413
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,775
Yes, that's right.

414
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,456
OK, I'm feeling generous.

415
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,254
I'll give you a try.

416
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,415
Thank you.

417
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,294
Thank you, sir.

418
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,529
Mickey Mouse
and Teddy Bear warned him.

419
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,733
Oh, Teddy Bear
wants his jack back off you.

420
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,773
I'm fed up with this business
about the jack.

421
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:33,016
Ask the Eel. He'll tell you.

422
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,655
- Really?
- He lent it to everyone.

423
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:38,374
Charlie, Zorro, Tarzan...

424
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,370
Dish it out.

425
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,695
I didn't get it.

426
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:46,020
I don't get a word
of what they're saying.

427
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:48,131
Mickey Mouse, Teddy Bear, eels...

428
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,536
Don't be silly. It's CB talk.

429
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,055
What?

430
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,771
I'll finish up,
then I'll show you.

431
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:55,890
OK.

432
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:03,009
- This is a CB.
- It's like a radio.

433
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,733
Yeah, with a mike.

434
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,218
It's how they communicate.

435
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,810
It's made for truckers.

436
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,410
Can other people talk to them?

437
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,369
Yes, you can even have one at home

438
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,059
to provide radio guidance.

439
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:23,450
When one gets lost,
you use a map to direct him.

440
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,809
You help them out.

441
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,169
Really?

442
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,729
Buy one. They're not very expensive.

443
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,692
They'll like your voice.

444
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,330
Do you think so?

445
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,337
Your place is ideal. On a hill

446
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,616
near the highway. You'll get lots!

447
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,492
But you need a new name.

448
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,936
What's wrong with ''Catherine''?

449
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,051
You can't use your real name.

450
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,820
That's why they're called
Zorro and so on.

451
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,298
Call yourself Double-Chin.

452
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,019
No, not Double-Chin.

453
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,010
Coffee!

454
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,336
Coming.

455
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,888
Some other name...

456
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,414
They'll hear from me!

457
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,895
I did what I said.

458
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,977
They heard me -just like you.

459
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,449
Thanks.

460
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,809
Again?

461
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:45,610
You're busting our balls,
Double-Chin! Put another record on!

462
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,652
From now on, call me Darling.

463
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,490
Darling, my ass!

464
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,173
No, just Darling.

465
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,178
I like this song, too.

466
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,219
New hairstyle.

467
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,569
It suits you.

468
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,939
There's a surprise upstairs.

469
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,178
- What?
- Well, go see.

470
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,849
And be nice.

471
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,650
Oh, right...

472
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,250
The truckers' channel is 19.

473
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:30,338
To put out a call,
you use Channel 19 or 27.

474
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,371
Then, you have to change channels.

475
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,258
To set up a date, you say,

476
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,697
''Calling all stations.
Anyone there for Darling 5-0?''

477
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,812
Yes, there is someone!

478
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,009
No! The guy answers,

479
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:46,179
''OK, I copy. This is Apollo 28.''
28's far away.

480
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,690
You can meet people with that?

481
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,737
Yes, I met my husband.

482
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,410
Wish I didn't respond that night...

483
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:17,576
Attila 34 for radio guidance
near Avranches.

484
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,172
OK, I copy.

485
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,416
This is Darling 5-0.

486
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,216
- Where are you?
- The D973 is shut.

487
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,295
I'm on a small road and I'm lost.

488
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:34,418
Go through La Haye-Belfond

489
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:37,737
on the D151 to Le Bourg.

490
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,659
Anyone out there for Roméo 1-4?

491
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:48,853
Is there a YL
looking for true love?

492
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,051
Yes, me, me, me!

493
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,810
He offered me a ''barley pop'

494
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:59,256
a drink in his truck.

495
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,812
Take me, I'm yours.

496
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,449
Give me a kiss.

497
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,931
I like your diesel-colored eyes.

498
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,139
Actually, he was drunk.

499
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,818
Go on, drive, drive!

500
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,732
Give me a kiss later, then.

501
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:30,929
I promise.

502
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:43,739
- Where to?
- To deliver cows in Holland.

503
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:46,978
I'm running late.
My boss'll yell. Screw him!

504
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,216
I like your rebellious attitude.

505
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,137
Actually, he was a wanker.

506
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,819
Give me a cuddle.

507
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,008
Lower.

508
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,169
What's your name?

509
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,814
- Your real name, Roméo.
- Joël.

510
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,696
Joël Epine. I'm 24.

511
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,012
A little ''barley pop''?

512
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,619
Pure malt.

513
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,499
I've never tried it.

514
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,894
It burns.

515
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,416
Oh, I can't see too well.

516
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:53,533
Are you allowed to drink?
What about Papa Bear?

517
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,219
Screw the cops!

518
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,979
That's what you'll have to do
later on!

519
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:37,098
Cut it out, will ya?

520
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,853
They can sense the abattoir.

521
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,379
I can't carry on.

522
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,219
They're moving too much.

523
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,219
We'll have a break.

524
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,212
They might overturn the truck.

525
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,609
Come on.

526
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,132
Behind me in the trailer,

527
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,854
the cows were to be slaughtered
at dawn.

528
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,134
- Mrs Clément?
- Yes.

529
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,498
Remember me? Catherine.

530
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,173
You haven't forgotten us.

531
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,972
How are you, beautiful?

532
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,375
I'm getting married.

533
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,775
No kidding! Hang on...

534
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,772
Let me guess his job.

535
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:37,735
Bingo!

536
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:41,818
You must be so happy.
Is he handsome?

537
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,539
He looks like James Dean.

538
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,537
He wears size 36 trousers!

539
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,495
You live together?

540
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,577
Yes, since we met 3 months ago.

541
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,179
We live in a house

542
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:55,813
overlooking the sea.

543
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,211
We pay no rent,
but we're doing it up.

544
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:02,216
Mrs Clément, I'm calling
to invite you to the wedding.

545
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,773
May 17 in Heurleville.

546
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,454
So soon?

547
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:06,934
You don't hang around!

548
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,739
Mrs Clément...

549
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:10,930
know what?

550
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:13,850
I'm pregnant!

551
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,294
So soon?

552
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,377
I haven't had my period yet,

553
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:20,134
so I think it was conceived
in the truck.

554
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,898
I'll tell you about it.

555
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:56,939
Hello.

556
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:18,739
This is Joël.

557
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,449
We're not interested.

558
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,252
I don't like this creature.

559
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:33,457
Shoulda picked the Blandamour boy.

560
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:36,339
He's bad meat.

561
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:43,980
Trust me, I know animals.
He's trouble.

562
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:45,408
What a joke!

563
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:50,210
Know what?

564
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:51,774
He was right.

565
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:55,012
'The best day of a woman's life
is her wedding. ''

566
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:56,693
What bullshit!

567
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:15,449
The lovebirds are here. Let's go.

568
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:23,329
Protect me.

569
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:26,452
Don't worry. My pals
have got some jokes planned.

570
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:28,734
Come on.

571
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:31,735
Ouch!

572
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:34,409
I do.

573
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:38,251
Do you, Joël Pierre Jean Epine,

574
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:40,815
take as your lawful wedded wife

575
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:45,810
Catherine Sophie Cécile Nicolle?

576
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,099
Screw the mayor!

577
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,089
I do.

578
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,572
- It's not real...
- It is.

579
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:38,056
We're the lads in the Navy!

580
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:01,337
Talking of family curiosities,

581
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:04,100
do you want to see
my daughter's paintings?

582
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:07,179
Come this way,
but I warn you, it's weird.

583
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:10,969
I couldn't stand it.

584
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:12,738
I thought I'd go crazy.

585
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:14,771
I was shaking all over.

586
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:18,573
It's time to go to the zoo
for the photos.

587
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:20,532
There's the meal after.

588
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:41,371
- Where are they all?
- I dunno.

589
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:42,854
- No, wine.
- Water...

590
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,971
No, red wine. Today's a party.

591
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:48,091
Everyone had the address...

592
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:52,129
Here, Dad.

593
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:54,376
A little toast...

594
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:58,411
- To my wife.
- Cheers!

595
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:12,130
Sorry.

596
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:15,738
Have this one.

597
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:18,419
That one won't drip.

598
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:51,571
Come on, beautiful.

599
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:54,330
''A wet bride is a lucky bride.''

600
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:57,735
That's a pile of crap, too.

601
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:16,572
''At weddings and funerals,
the Devil is busy.''

602
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:34,252
What's with the car?

603
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:37,094
I didn't see anything. What's wrong?

604
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:39,410
A big hole in the windshield.

605
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:43,292
Maybe last night's storm
blew a tile off the roof.

606
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,414
The Granvilles are coming tonight

607
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:49,973
for a party.

608
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,011
Yes, I'll get everything ready.

609
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:53,376
Gotta be hot.

610
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:56,855
Here.

611
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:01,133
What is it?

612
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:04,651
We weren't rich,
but he always managed to have fun.

613
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:07,053
It was a game we played.

614
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:10,376
I could never say no to him.

615
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:13,457
It was a laugh at first.

616
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,933
OK, Mr Epine.

617
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:22,009
You have diabetes,
high blood pressure,

618
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:25,932
serious eye problems,

619
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:28,012
and high triglycerides,

620
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,055
but your alcohol level
is off the scale.

621
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,611
33 gammas per liter of blood

622
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:36,698
is the maximum
to renew a heavy goods license.

623
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:38,339
You have 160!

624
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:40,808
160 gammas!

625
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:42,494
Jesus!

626
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:44,769
Do you understand?

627
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:50,178
What did they say?

628
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:55,578
That I have too many kids!

629
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:02,412
No more after this one.

630
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:08,012
Screw doctors!

631
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:24,937
The next day,
his boss fired him on the spot

632
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:26,892
for professional misconduct.

633
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:37,894
Not in front of the TV!

634
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:39,453
Where, then?

635
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:42,615
There!

636
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:49,213
Yeah, much better.

637
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:51,854
Screw you!

638
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:06,373
I liked this little dog.
He was called Flappy,

639
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,492
like the flaps on trucks

640
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:11,009
to protect them from mud and water.

641
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:13,051
He was Mrs Clément's
wedding present,

642
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:15,455
because I told her about Nixon.

643
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:18,330
He was afraid of Joël
and hid from him.

644
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:20,656
But he was always under my feet.

645
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:25,414
'Night, baby. 'Night, Flappy.

646
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:50,133
What's he doing there?

647
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,013
Well, you were out.

648
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:54,530
Outside, mutt! To your kennel!

649
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:22,495
Scram!

650
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:24,689
Scram!

651
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:34,733
Mind the door.

652
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:41,769
Sit down.

653
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:46,293
You'll wake Kevin.

654
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,138
Huh? Oh, yeah...

655
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:53,735
I had trouble getting him to sleep.

656
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:56,293
Where are you going?

657
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:58,896
Not tonight. I'm tired.

658
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:02,774
Hang on...

659
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:11,815
Is she Mr Cholet's daughter?
I thought she'd gone.

660
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:14,890
I came to see my family
and friends.

661
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:17,253
Keep the noise down.

662
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:20,648
I don't want to sing lullabies
all night.

663
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:28,132
- Hang on...
- Pull!

664
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:10,696
He was wasted last Wednesday.
He's so thin he can't hold his drink.

665
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,777
I could see he was glassy-eyed.

666
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:15,369
I know what to expect
from his footsteps.

667
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:17,771
He kicked my dog downstairs,

668
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:19,459
then drove him outside.

669
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:21,855
My dog started barking.
He went...

670
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:28,380
So, my husband got the hunting rifle.

671
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:38,455
I was mad at my Roméo at the time,

672
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:41,016
but I forgave the love of my life.

673
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:43,690
He's young, handsome, virile.

674
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:45,772
Did I say he wears a size 36?

675
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:49,219
It was an accident.

676
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:52,173
He just wanted to scare it
by shooting near it.

677
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:54,612
And my dog was getting old

678
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:56,617
and was starting to stink.

679
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:58,816
Thursday June 21

680
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:02,699
A silent wife is never beaten.

681
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:09,697
I've got some good news.

682
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:11,050
What?

683
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:13,697
I think you'll be pleased, hon.

684
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:17,339
I've found a solution.
It'll all be OK now.

685
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:19,212
Wait! Wait a minute!

686
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:22,458
I've got good news, too.
Wait...

687
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:33,569
What's that for?

688
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:36,453
I had it cleaned.
The wine stain's gone.

689
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:38,931
Who goes first?

690
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:40,290
You.

691
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:42,373
What do you think of Tom?

692
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:45,333
Don't know him. Who is he?

693
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:48,938
Your son who's due in January.

694
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,170
Like that name?

695
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:54,773
You're joking, I hope.

696
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:56,135
Don't you like it?

697
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:58,092
You think it's too American?

698
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:01,177
You're not preggie again!

699
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:02,530
I am. Why?

700
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:05,973
Get rid of it. Now's not the time.

701
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:08,256
No. Why? It's natural.

702
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:09,933
Screw nature!

703
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:12,700
Since when do you decide
on your own?

704
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:32,448
Why did I bother having it cleaned?

705
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:57,091
He sat there for ages,
wondering who would feed him.

706
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:13,373
That was his good news:

707
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:15,172
landscape gardening.

708
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:18,932
He made me borrow a fortune
and stand surety.

709
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:21,736
That got me into big trouble later.

710
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:24,332
I became what I didn't want:

711
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:26,098
a farmer's wifey!

712
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:38,975
Tom's birth was normal,
despite my ''ironing day''.

713
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:44,054
1 0 years later, poor Tommy
didn't find it such a good idea,

714
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:45,818
but what's done is done.

715
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:49,291
Still one feed at night.
Two kids are a lot of work.

716
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:51,656
Tuesday March 29

717
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:55,008
A woman falls 7 times and gets up.

718
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:09,055
I need some cash.

719
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:11,649
I can't repay the loan
if we spend it all.

720
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:13,339
Screw the bank!

721
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:15,378
Hand it over, quick!

722
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:19,015
Come on!

723
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:27,369
How much?

724
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:30,291
The café, the club, and poker.

725
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:35,734
Give it here!

726
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:41,410
He partied with his mistresses.

727
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:44,010
My husband was very popular!

728
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:48,173
But he was weak,
influenced by 3 bad boys

729
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:50,291
who called me Fatso.

730
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:51,728
He joined in.

731
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:55,376
He said if I was thrown downstairs,
I'd just roll.

732
01:00:56,740 --> 01:01:01,018
We were on a crazy train
we couldn't stop, either of us.

733
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:05,135
Oh, Jesus!

734
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:06,888
Shoulda put more on!

735
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:08,453
Wow, what a beaut!

736
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:10,571
- Another hand?
- No, I quit.

737
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:12,054
I'm broke.

738
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:14,137
So, gamble something else.

739
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:17,016
Such as... your wife!

740
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:20,532
If you win, you take it all.

741
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:22,930
If you lose, we take the fat cow!

742
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:25,975
All together.

743
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:35,135
Deal the cards.

744
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:50,377
When I think back on my life,
I get dizzy.

745
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:53,252
There was worse to come.

746
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:15,770
Mom, my ball's in the cellar.

747
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:17,208
Dad doesn't want

748
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:19,928
to open the door.

749
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:27,373
I'll get it, then.

750
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:57,611
I never should've cut that rope.

751
01:02:57,820 --> 01:03:01,290
He said I should've let him die.
I said, ''You have to live''.

752
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,695
He said, ''Screw life. Screw life''.

753
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:05,219
Twice.

754
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:21,056
I won't see those guys again.

755
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:23,856
I won't see 'em again, I promise.

756
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:36,058
A drunkard's empty promise.

757
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:55,738
Oh, sorry, Mom.

758
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:57,857
It doesn't matter.

759
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:12,252
We'll hire an au pair.

760
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:16,458
We'll give her bed and board
and not pay her.

761
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:20,169
She'll sleep
in the room next to ours.

762
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:22,776
She'll look after the home
and the kids.

763
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:26,091
Things will be better for me, then.

764
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:36,180
It seemed a good idea,
especially as

765
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:38,655
I was pregnant for the third time.

766
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:41,496
Who by? I never found out.

767
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:50,336
I hate this baby inside me.

768
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:02,133
It's a girl!

769
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:04,049
Thanks.

770
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:20,931
Océane was in an incubator
as she had something wrong.

771
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:24,697
I didn't want to see her,
I didn't love her.

772
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:28,816
Meanwhile, the au pair
looked after the kids.

773
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:46,219
They called her Auntie.

774
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:48,570
They saw
that Auntie slept with Daddy.

775
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:50,816
I went to see Joséphine,

776
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:52,692
the exorcist.

777
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:55,808
She gave me pills of every color.

778
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:17,777
The au pair's bewitched him!

779
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:20,494
She's crazy, very high-strung.

780
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:24,733
He wants to live with her
and keep the kids.

781
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:28,250
I said no, because I'm his wife
and they're my kids.

782
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:32,416
No, we can't go. He said if we did,

783
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:34,417
he'd find us and kill them.

784
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:36,690
I said, ''Kill me too!'' but he said,

785
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:39,779
''Not you, that'd be too easy,''
then he laughed.

786
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:01,099
Monday September 3

787
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:03,930
The stupid fuckin' thing!

788
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:07,529
Look, I won a great chicken!

789
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:10,216
Cook it for tonight's meal.

790
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:12,815
Cluck, cluck!

791
01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:27,295
You're the best.

792
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:30,858
Yeah, but no. I just know,
so I told him.

793
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:33,818
What's the point, otherwise?

794
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:40,699
It stinks.

795
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:46,332
Are you fuckin' stupid?

796
01:07:47,820 --> 01:07:48,730
Look!

797
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:51,099
Look!

798
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:52,932
Get rid of that.

799
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:57,056
He won the chicken at the market.

800
01:07:57,980 --> 01:07:59,618
I killed it and plucked it,

801
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:02,653
but with the pills I was on,
I forgot to gut it.

802
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:07,138
So, they put the kids to bed.

803
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:10,457
She lent over
to whisper a secret in Roméo's ear.

804
01:08:10,860 --> 01:08:13,090
He stood up and grabbed me.

805
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:16,497
They tied my hands
and took me outside.

806
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:19,098
I put up no resistance.

807
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:09,138
Where does it hurt?

808
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:12,934
It hurts all over. Always has done.

809
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:15,259
What happened?

810
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:40,217
Why didn't you
suffocate me at birth?

811
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:43,529
Or bang my head against the wall,

812
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:47,130
the way you do
with kittens no-one wants?

813
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:54,973
Who did this?

814
01:09:57,220 --> 01:09:58,448
Your husband?

815
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:02,097
Tell me the monster's name.

816
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:04,493
Roméo.

817
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:21,772
I'll get you treated in St Lô
and tell the police.

818
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:24,011
Don't take me to the hospital.

819
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:27,257
And don't tell the police

820
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:29,414
or my parents.

821
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:32,611
I want to get by on my own.

822
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:36,689
By the way...

823
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:40,091
how are my parents?

824
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:42,570
Your ma leaves the post alone now.

825
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:45,453
Your dad had an accident
at the fair.

826
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:49,134
A bull kicked him against a fence.

827
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:53,299
Sleep, get some rest.

828
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:56,540
Then, I'll take you
to see a colleague.

829
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:59,256
Just for X-rays, OK?

830
01:11:52,540 --> 01:11:54,417
Mommy, Mommy!

831
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:56,653
Where were you?

832
01:11:57,700 --> 01:11:59,691
Mommy, where were you?

833
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:02,457
Gone to see your chicks?

834
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:04,179
What chicks?

835
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:05,814
You're my chicks.

836
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:08,011
No, the chicks you lay at night

837
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:10,211
in the yard with Dad and Auntie.

838
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:11,896
Auntie...

839
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:14,089
Where is she?

840
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:16,735
- She isn't here.
- Go play.

841
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:23,859
Where is she?

842
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:28,534
Gone. She was afraid
you'd tell the cops.

843
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:32,248
That why you're acting so dumb?

844
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:33,695
Well, yeah.

845
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:41,380
I only came back
for the start of school.

846
01:12:47,140 --> 01:12:48,129
Tommy!

847
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:51,093
C'mon, hurry up!

848
01:13:02,660 --> 01:13:03,809
Goodbye.

849
01:13:05,060 --> 01:13:06,288
Work hard, my dears.

850
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:07,728
Bye, Mom.

851
01:13:07,940 --> 01:13:09,737
Make me proud of you.

852
01:13:12,460 --> 01:13:13,893
Bye now.

853
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:18,259
I turned around

854
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:21,293
and didn't see them again for years.

855
01:13:33,220 --> 01:13:35,450
I told them, ''I'm Catherine Nicolle.

856
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:37,457
I've just abandoned my kids.

857
01:13:37,660 --> 01:13:39,776
Don't ask me why. Not now.

858
01:13:39,980 --> 01:13:42,448
I have to start a new life
to get them back.

859
01:13:42,660 --> 01:13:46,619
I need a position, money, a home,

860
01:13:46,820 --> 01:13:48,776
and to look after my health.

861
01:13:48,980 --> 01:13:50,379
Give me time.

862
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:53,572
To get back on my feet
and get my kids back.

863
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:56,248
Nice 'n' slow. All by myself. ''

864
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:14,569
I lost time due to health problems
from the stones:

865
01:14:14,780 --> 01:14:18,614
phlebitis, a pulmonary embolism,
and cancer of the ovaries.

866
01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:23,093
The judge put me
in an emergency shelter

867
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:25,689
until the decision-makers decided.

868
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:31,498
What I told the judge

869
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:33,577
was pointless, because my husband

870
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:37,011
filed a complaint against me
as soon as I left

871
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:39,253
for abandoning my family.

872
01:14:39,780 --> 01:14:42,135
He didn't mention the other woman,

873
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:44,093
or all the rest.

874
01:14:58,020 --> 01:15:00,693
So, I got saddled
with all the debts,

875
01:15:00,980 --> 01:15:04,336
blamed in the divorce,
a 3-month suspended sentence,

876
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:08,374
and a year's probation
for not paying the alimony.

877
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:11,135
And I couldn't get my kids back.

878
01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:14,058
I was the bad guy.

879
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:17,212
Anyone heading for St Lô?

880
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:19,292
Stuck at Montchaton.

881
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:22,936
Looking for a detour to the N75.

882
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:29,735
Calling all stations.
Anyone out there

883
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:32,056
to help get me off the D20?

884
01:15:35,220 --> 01:15:37,370
Oh, OK, I've got it.

885
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:39,252
It's easier than I thought.

886
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:46,170
Roger. Monkey Wrench
is cruising the big slab.

887
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:50,260
Roger.
I'm at La Donneuse truck stop.

888
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:51,859
Can you tell him?

889
01:15:53,260 --> 01:15:57,048
This is Darling 5-0.
Anyone out there for Darling 5-0?

890
01:15:57,820 --> 01:16:01,130
I need to talk.
Anyone out there for Darling 5-0?

891
01:16:01,580 --> 01:16:03,093
I'm listening, Darling.

892
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:08,053
He said:
''I know you're not the bad guy. ''

893
01:16:13,315 --> 01:16:14,748
Phone call for you.

894
01:16:15,115 --> 01:16:16,184
For me?

895
01:16:23,635 --> 01:16:25,307
I must see Mrs Blanchard!

896
01:16:25,515 --> 01:16:26,630
Mrs Blanchard's office?

897
01:16:26,835 --> 01:16:29,349
First right, third door on the left.

898
01:16:31,395 --> 01:16:33,067
Where's Mrs Blanchard?

899
01:16:34,995 --> 01:16:37,304
I couldn't hear properly
on the phone.

900
01:16:37,515 --> 01:16:38,834
What's happened?

901
01:16:39,035 --> 01:16:39,911
Later.

902
01:16:42,275 --> 01:16:43,264
Here.

903
01:16:48,355 --> 01:16:50,744
I got this today.
I wanted you to know.

904
01:16:53,075 --> 01:16:54,793
''Psychological assessment.

905
01:16:54,995 --> 01:16:57,463
The Nicolle children
live with their father

906
01:16:58,075 --> 01:16:59,588
as the mother left home.

907
01:17:01,275 --> 01:17:03,994
Decision to put them
in emergency care,

908
01:17:04,195 --> 01:17:05,344
as a result of

909
01:17:06,555 --> 01:17:08,113
disturbing behavior,

910
01:17:08,355 --> 01:17:09,583
malnutrition,

911
01:17:10,955 --> 01:17:12,991
serious instability,

912
01:17:14,195 --> 01:17:15,787
a regressive situation,

913
01:17:15,995 --> 01:17:17,587
constant bed-wetting,

914
01:17:18,275 --> 01:17:19,503
and illiteracy.''

915
01:17:19,755 --> 01:17:20,983
Illiteracy?

916
01:17:21,875 --> 01:17:23,228
That's what they say.

917
01:17:36,995 --> 01:17:39,463
I spent months
drinking in that café.

918
01:17:42,915 --> 01:17:45,065
Sure I went back to see the judge.

919
01:17:46,835 --> 01:17:51,306
She gawped at me,
said, ''Sit down' and asked me...

920
01:17:52,595 --> 01:17:56,110
Why didn't you tell me everything
the first time?

921
01:17:56,515 --> 01:17:58,187
Because I'm too shy.

922
01:18:02,515 --> 01:18:05,632
I wonder how much
of your story is true.

923
01:18:10,555 --> 01:18:12,750
I don't really know either anymore.

924
01:18:14,195 --> 01:18:16,663
The shame I feel
takes up a lot of room.

925
01:18:18,595 --> 01:18:20,904
Often, truth and lies get mixed up.

926
01:18:21,155 --> 01:18:23,225
It all gets mixed up in my head.

927
01:18:25,435 --> 01:18:27,630
Yet I've always protected my head.

928
01:18:27,835 --> 01:18:29,473
He could hit me anywhere,

929
01:18:29,675 --> 01:18:32,348
but I'd always put
my hands up like this.

930
01:18:37,835 --> 01:18:40,668
I left to save my kids,
I know that.

931
01:18:42,915 --> 01:18:46,510
I shouldn't say this -
we find it hard to believe you.

932
01:18:47,755 --> 01:18:50,713
If you want us to progress,
you must tell me

933
01:18:51,995 --> 01:18:53,667
the real truth.

934
01:18:54,915 --> 01:18:56,906
The truth is impossible to say.

935
01:18:58,395 --> 01:19:02,627
Without padding, there's just shit.
No-one's interested in that.

936
01:19:03,275 --> 01:19:05,072
It doesn't make a nice story.

937
01:19:06,795 --> 01:19:09,389
Your office is full
of stories like mine.

938
01:19:10,155 --> 01:19:11,634
But what people all want

939
01:19:11,835 --> 01:19:14,554
is nice stories about nice people.

940
01:19:15,635 --> 01:19:17,227
Other people's shit

941
01:19:17,435 --> 01:19:19,426
doesn't interest them.

942
01:19:21,155 --> 01:19:22,588
I'm sorry.

943
01:19:30,955 --> 01:19:34,709
OK, I'll try to be
as precise as I can.

944
01:19:34,915 --> 01:19:37,588
In exchange,
I want to ask you for something.

945
01:19:38,675 --> 01:19:39,551
What?

946
01:19:40,755 --> 01:19:42,711
Can you call me Darling

947
01:19:42,955 --> 01:19:43,990
in your files?

948
01:19:48,515 --> 01:19:49,948
And also...

949
01:19:51,795 --> 01:19:52,591
What?

950
01:19:52,795 --> 01:19:54,831
Can you make me sound nice?

951
01:19:55,235 --> 01:19:57,749
You'll use fine sentences
and fancy words.

952
01:19:57,955 --> 01:19:59,832
But I want to stay nice...

953
01:20:00,035 --> 01:20:02,230
in the report you'll write.

954
01:20:03,115 --> 01:20:04,912
I want people to read the files

955
01:20:05,115 --> 01:20:07,470
and say:
''The girl in the story's nice.''

956
01:20:07,715 --> 01:20:08,864
There.

957
01:20:09,075 --> 01:20:10,349
That's all.

958
01:20:15,115 --> 01:20:16,150
OK.

959
01:20:16,715 --> 01:20:18,467
I'm listening, Darling.

960
01:20:25,155 --> 01:20:26,907
That last night,

961
01:20:27,115 --> 01:20:30,664
I looked like a sick old peacock
displayed in the yard.

962
01:20:33,115 --> 01:20:34,867
They took some feathers

963
01:20:35,155 --> 01:20:37,794
and wanted me to be a hen
for a laugh.

964
01:20:38,915 --> 01:20:40,826
They wanted me to lay stones,

965
01:20:41,035 --> 01:20:42,514
to punish me.

966
01:20:43,515 --> 01:20:45,790
I didn't want to, so they hit me.

967
01:20:52,635 --> 01:20:53,988
I left, because

968
01:20:54,195 --> 01:20:56,186
I was at the end of my tether.

969
01:20:57,395 --> 01:20:59,511
So, I screamed till my lungs hurt,

970
01:20:59,715 --> 01:21:01,467
like when I was under the table

971
01:21:01,675 --> 01:21:05,031
on birthdays... Did I mention that?
I don't remember.

972
01:21:05,515 --> 01:21:07,471
When I was a kid, I had to say:

973
01:21:07,675 --> 01:21:10,064
''Happy birthday, Dad!
Many happy returns!''

974
01:21:10,275 --> 01:21:12,584
That night, I had to go
''Cluck, cluck!''

975
01:21:17,275 --> 01:21:20,187
Worst of all was
seeing shadows at the window.

976
01:21:29,715 --> 01:21:31,626
My children's eyes...

977
01:21:31,915 --> 01:21:34,110
I told you I'd been through worse.

978
01:21:37,475 --> 01:21:39,147
Later on...

979
01:22:00,875 --> 01:22:02,194
Hello, ma'am.

980
01:22:30,675 --> 01:22:32,188
Well, say hello.

981
01:22:36,635 --> 01:22:37,624
Hello, ma'am.

982
01:22:37,835 --> 01:22:39,632
Sorry, I didn't recognize you.

983
01:22:39,915 --> 01:22:41,143
Me either.

984
01:22:51,235 --> 01:22:52,668
Call her Mom.

985
01:22:52,875 --> 01:22:55,105
She's your Mom. She's come for you.

986
01:22:59,915 --> 01:23:00,665
What's wrong?

987
01:23:15,075 --> 01:23:17,145
Why didn't you get in the back, too?

988
01:23:17,355 --> 01:23:19,027
Tommy scares me.

989
01:23:25,715 --> 01:23:26,989
You OK, Tommy?

990
01:24:05,955 --> 01:24:07,434
Why did you brake?

991
01:24:08,515 --> 01:24:10,824
Why didn't you drive
into the wall, Mom?

992
01:24:11,195 --> 01:24:13,709
We'd have all been squashed together.

993
01:24:23,195 --> 01:24:24,344
Look, children.

994
01:24:24,555 --> 01:24:27,433
A teepee with a line through it
is an ''A''.

995
01:24:34,835 --> 01:24:35,904
That's a ''B''.

996
01:24:39,515 --> 01:24:40,584
C'mon, Tommy, ''B''.

997
01:24:43,115 --> 01:24:44,343
It's from Belgium.

998
01:24:48,235 --> 01:24:50,032
Look, that one's from Denmark.

999
01:25:00,915 --> 01:25:02,189
Oh, look.

1000
01:25:02,955 --> 01:25:05,025
That's an R240.

1001
01:25:21,635 --> 01:25:24,707
- That one?
- I couldn't see.

1002
01:25:27,875 --> 01:25:29,831
Based on a true story.

1003
01:25:30,035 --> 01:25:33,345
Darling is now a cleaner
for a law firm in Normandy.

1004
01:25:33,555 --> 01:25:37,833
She is rebuilding her life,
having lost custody of her children.
