1
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,061
Noby!

2
00:00:42,521 --> 00:00:44,223
Over here!

3
00:00:45,943 --> 00:00:47,344
Shizuka!

4
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:50,769
- This is fun!
- Okay!

5
00:00:53,195 --> 00:00:55,197
Hurry!

6
00:00:56,197 --> 00:00:58,399
Wait for me!

7
00:00:58,748 --> 00:01:04,522
Noby, wake up!
You won't have time for breakfast!

8
00:01:04,556 --> 00:01:09,628
You'll be late for school!!

9
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:14,874
A dream...

10
00:01:17,032 --> 00:01:21,404
 <i>He went back to sleep.</i>
He'll be late for school

11
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:25,202
<i>Noby! Wake up already!!</i>

12
00:01:30,309 --> 00:01:33,078
<i>Mom, Why didn't you wake me?!</i>

13
00:01:33,112 --> 00:01:35,381
 <i>I tried many times.</i><i>

14
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:38,840
I'm off!

15
00:01:43,065 --> 00:01:45,767
I can still make it.

16
00:01:46,694 --> 00:01:48,696
 <i>See? I knew it.</i><i>

17
00:01:48,794 --> 00:01:51,897
 <i>Let's keep watching.</i>

18
00:01:51,944 --> 00:01:54,747
We had steak 3 days in a row

19
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:57,876
Noby...

20
00:01:58,025 --> 00:02:00,828
Stil standing in the hall?

21
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:05,573
How does it feel to be
punished for being late?

22
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:10,879
I wouldn't know.
I've never been punished.

23
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,381
Yo, Sneech.

24
00:02:14,821 --> 00:02:18,124
Give him a break.

25
00:02:18,219 --> 00:02:23,324
He's been standing forever and he's tired.

26
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:24,939
Big G.

27
00:02:24,974 --> 00:02:27,578
You can play ball with us today.

28
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:29,801
Be thankful.

29
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,835
I have another plans.

30
00:02:32,507 --> 00:02:36,111
What? Don't be so cocky.

31
00:02:37,186 --> 00:02:40,789
Stop it, you two!
You're hurting him.

32
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,318
It's none of your business.

33
00:02:44,749 --> 00:02:46,685
Don't talk to me like that.

34
00:02:47,117 --> 00:02:48,853
I'm fine, Shizuka.

35
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:51,731
 <i>He needs a girl's help.</i><i>

36
00:02:52,222 --> 00:02:54,957
 <i>He's more pathetic than I thought.</i><i>

37
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:57,319
Next! Noby!

38
00:02:57,501 --> 00:02:59,704
Okay!

39
00:03:06,517 --> 00:03:09,053
Noby! Nice catch!

40
00:03:10,343 --> 00:03:16,648
- Let me try, big brother.
- Okay, just once, Little G.

41
00:03:16,732 --> 00:03:17,733
Thanks.

42
00:03:25,644 --> 00:03:28,046
 <i>Pretty bad at sports.</i><i>

43
00:03:28,767 --> 00:03:29,768
 <i>You're right.</i><i>

44
00:03:34,095 --> 00:03:36,497
 <i>He's studying. Maybe he's smart.</i><i>

45
00:03:36,584 --> 00:03:37,585
 <i>I don't know... see?</i><i>

46
00:03:42,794 --> 00:03:43,995
<i>Something fell.</i>

47
00:03:44,132 --> 00:03:47,835
<i>Let's not do this.</i>
It's no use going.

48
00:03:48,214 --> 00:03:50,015
<i>We have to do something.</i>

49
00:03:50,619 --> 00:03:54,390
<i>- We have to help him.</i>
- Not possible!

50
00:03:54,413 --> 00:03:57,616
<i>Let's go talk to great-great grandfather.</i>

51
00:03:59,796 --> 00:04:03,000
If not, I'm going to
push the button on your nose.

52
00:04:03,936 --> 00:04:07,439
Okay, okay. Whatever you say.

53
00:04:26,114 --> 00:04:31,619
STAND BY ME
DORAEMON

54
00:04:49,238 --> 00:04:51,240
It's opening.

55
00:04:58,056 --> 00:05:02,060
Noby... You're Noby, right?

56
00:05:19,634 --> 00:05:21,636
Aaaargghhh!!!

57
00:05:22,152 --> 00:05:25,455
- Seal!
- Don't be so rude!

58
00:05:25,696 --> 00:05:30,569
But I can't blame you.
It's dark in here

59
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:38,974
Good evening, I'm Doraemon.

60
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,442
Aaaa...

61
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:47,508
Let me come out.
Oh, a drawer?

62
00:05:48,605 --> 00:05:50,407
Hi, I'm Soby.

63
00:05:52,034 --> 00:05:54,870
Why were you in there?

64
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:57,224
Stay calm and listen.

65
00:05:57,862 --> 00:05:59,263
We're from the future.

66
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:11,582
Wow, how does this work?

67
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:15,808
Your things in the drawer are safe.

68
00:06:15,881 --> 00:06:19,184
They're in here in my Four-dimensional Pocket.

69
00:06:19,934 --> 00:06:22,537
I can fit anything in it.

70
00:06:22,637 --> 00:06:24,740
Lots and lots of things.

71
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:38,499
Here you go.

72
00:06:38,513 --> 00:06:39,847
Thank you.

73
00:06:40,905 --> 00:06:45,610
In any case, I still don't understand.

74
00:06:47,224 --> 00:06:49,025
You're my descendants?

75
00:06:49,067 --> 00:06:51,670
Your grandchild's grandchild.

76
00:06:51,714 --> 00:06:54,516
I come 4 generations after you.

77
00:06:56,091 --> 00:06:59,761
I'm still a kid,
I don't have grandkids.

78
00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:01,891
Yummy!!!

79
00:07:02,986 --> 00:07:04,854
What is this called?

80
00:07:06,929 --> 00:07:07,930
Yummy buns.

81
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:13,833
I've never had anything so good.

82
00:07:18,395 --> 00:07:22,799
Great-great grandpa,
you'll be an adult one day, right?

83
00:07:23,297 --> 00:07:25,266
You'll get married, right?

84
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:29,166
- I will?
- Yes. 19 years from now.

85
00:07:29,167 --> 00:07:30,167
Really?

86
00:07:31,232 --> 00:07:33,434
Who am I gonna marry?

87
00:07:34,056 --> 00:07:38,895
Your wedding photo,
Her name is Little G.

88
00:07:39,198 --> 00:07:42,301
- Little G?
- Your life from then on.

89
00:07:44,749 --> 00:07:47,251
My wife... A bully like her...

90
00:07:47,809 --> 00:07:51,814
You're lying!
Go away! Go!

91
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:56,522
Get out of here!
I don't believe you!

92
00:07:58,823 --> 00:08:01,894
Don't get mad, okay?

93
00:08:03,258 --> 00:08:08,763
Unless things change,
your life is the pits.

94
00:08:08,834 --> 00:08:10,837
Look at this.

95
00:08:11,184 --> 00:08:14,687
You can't find a job,
so you start your own company.

96
00:08:15,697 --> 00:08:18,099
But, your office burns down in a fire.

97
00:08:19,568 --> 00:08:22,872
Your debts from the fire snowball.

98
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:28,123
That's why we're really poor.
All our things are old and shabby.

99
00:08:30,415 --> 00:08:31,416
Got it?

100
00:08:33,783 --> 00:08:38,888
I'm sorry.
I caused you guys so much trouble.

101
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,126
I wish I could dissapear.

102
00:08:46,358 --> 00:08:51,062
Hey, don't get so down,
you can change your fate.

103
00:08:52,651 --> 00:08:54,654
Really?

104
00:08:55,805 --> 00:08:59,608
That's why we're here.
Right, Doraemon?

105
00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:04,937
I still haven't said yes.

106
00:09:05,733 --> 00:09:07,535
Hold on.

107
00:09:08,263 --> 00:09:11,133
Doaemon, we talked about this.

108
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:26,667
Allright then.
You're making me do this.

109
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:33,407
Until you help Nobby be happy...

110
00:09:33,451 --> 00:09:37,956
...you can't come back to the future.

111
00:09:46,567 --> 00:09:47,903
You're so mean, Soby!

112
00:09:48,809 --> 00:09:53,714
Doraemon will take care of you.
I'm quite busy.

113
00:09:54,893 --> 00:09:57,362
I can't! Impossible!

114
00:09:57,938 --> 00:10:03,243
It's programmed so you can
come back once Nobby finds happiness.

115
00:10:03,286 --> 00:10:04,287
Really?

116
00:10:05,424 --> 00:10:09,128
Even if you don't want to,
you'll have to come back.

117
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:13,346
Of course I'll want to go back.

118
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,977
I'm counting on you, Doraemon.

119
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,764
He could be a bit difficult.

120
00:10:25,107 --> 00:10:29,043
But I'm sure you'll
be glad to have him around.

121
00:10:30,193 --> 00:10:32,196
See ya!

122
00:10:39,409 --> 00:10:41,745
Thanks, Doraemon.

123
00:10:49,431 --> 00:10:54,637
I can't do this,
I'm going back to the future.

124
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,332
Improper words detected.

125
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,443
Okay, I get it!

126
00:11:06,314 --> 00:11:08,916
I'll help Noby find happiness.

127
00:11:11,777 --> 00:11:17,183
I can't believe Soby
really activated the program.

128
00:11:18,695 --> 00:11:20,497
I hope I'm not hurt.

129
00:11:24,206 --> 00:11:26,543
Can you really help me?

130
00:11:27,712 --> 00:11:31,448
I'll show you how
amazing the 22nd century is!!

131
00:11:34,018 --> 00:11:35,019
Hopter!

132
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:39,321
- What is it?
- Don't worry.

133
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:46,092
What does it do?
Go out the window?

134
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,243
You'll enjoy it.

135
00:11:52,682 --> 00:11:53,883
Aaaaarrrrggghhh!!!

136
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:05,935
I'm floating!

137
00:12:06,994 --> 00:12:08,597
Cool, right?

138
00:12:10,422 --> 00:12:13,092
It hurts. I'm not dreaming.

139
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:27,770
Help!
I'm gonna fly off into the space!

140
00:12:27,801 --> 00:12:32,507
Calm down! Calm down!

141
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:34,853
Stop! Stop! Stop!

142
00:12:35,843 --> 00:12:37,344
It stopped.

143
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:38,380
Noby!

144
00:12:38,931 --> 00:12:39,999
Start working!

145
00:12:40,058 --> 00:12:41,861
Start working! Please!

146
00:12:48,411 --> 00:12:50,613
Noby! Wait!

147
00:12:58,292 --> 00:13:00,894
I can't swim!

148
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:25,005
You're getting the hang of it.

149
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:41,945
This is easy once you get used of it.

150
00:13:46,648 --> 00:13:50,751
Even little kids can used it.

151
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,314
What is it?

152
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:08,840
Shizuka's house.

153
00:14:10,715 --> 00:14:14,451
- A friend?
- Yeah, classmate.

154
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,305
Let's go surprice her.

155
00:14:18,685 --> 00:14:20,821
Is she still up?

156
00:14:25,471 --> 00:14:28,708
She's sleeping. Too bad.

157
00:14:33,903 --> 00:14:36,706
She's pretty.

158
00:14:37,766 --> 00:14:41,604
You think so?
Even in future standards?

159
00:14:41,668 --> 00:14:46,472
Really? I see, I see.

160
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:47,892
I totaly like...

161
00:14:53,451 --> 00:14:54,451
What?

162
00:14:55,609 --> 00:14:59,345
Noby, you're still up?
Go to sleep.

163
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:03,047
What did you just say?

164
00:15:03,863 --> 00:15:08,935
Me and Shizuka... We're getting...

165
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,681
Married?

166
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:14,179
I wanna get back to the future.

167
00:15:14,802 --> 00:15:19,340
I think it's the
surest way to make you happy.

168
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:25,091
Me? Marry Shizuka?
I feel awkward.

169
00:15:26,222 --> 00:15:32,228
You don't have
to go through all the trouble...

170
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,567
So you don't want my help?

171
00:15:35,093 --> 00:15:36,294
Yes, I do.

172
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:39,538
But how?

173
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,602
I'm go to school!

174
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:51,800
Doraemon?

175
00:15:52,637 --> 00:15:54,941
No more being late for school.

176
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:57,556
Anywhere Door!

177
00:15:59,463 --> 00:16:00,531
What's that?

178
00:16:00,819 --> 00:16:04,288
Say where you want
to go and open the door.

179
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:05,717
School!

180
00:16:09,374 --> 00:16:11,376
I got a new toy yesterday.

181
00:16:13,622 --> 00:16:15,824
Good morning.

182
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,892
Noby's early. Unbelievable.

183
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:26,821
Shizuka...

184
00:16:28,398 --> 00:16:30,199
Hi, Noby.

185
00:16:32,134 --> 00:16:35,304
Godd morning.
You're early today.

186
00:16:37,192 --> 00:16:38,494
Memory Bread!

187
00:16:38,805 --> 00:16:42,476
Eat it and you can
memorize what's written on it.

188
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,673
Here! Here! Here!

189
00:16:49,147 --> 00:16:51,149
I know the answers!

190
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:55,138
You got better score than me!

191
00:16:55,488 --> 00:17:00,393
Doraemon, I wanna beat Big G!

192
00:17:01,128 --> 00:17:03,264
Invinsible Cape!

193
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,439
Mom! I'm hungry!

194
00:17:10,056 --> 00:17:13,026
Hey! Who's doing that?!

195
00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:15,023
Ouch! My boil!

196
00:17:15,891 --> 00:17:17,592
Grabber Glove!

197
00:17:18,866 --> 00:17:21,970
Being good at sports
can make you popular.

198
00:17:28,573 --> 00:17:29,841
I caught it!

199
00:17:30,035 --> 00:17:32,038
Nice catch!

200
00:17:36,149 --> 00:17:40,353
I saw that! Mr. S!

201
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:42,630
Doraemon!

202
00:17:43,157 --> 00:17:45,759
Time Kerchief!

203
00:17:46,207 --> 00:17:51,612
Things go back to the way they were.
You can also fast forward them.

204
00:17:54,108 --> 00:17:56,310
You shouldn't lie like that.

205
00:17:56,361 --> 00:17:57,362
Weird!

206
00:17:58,448 --> 00:18:01,584
Shizuka, what are you drawing?

207
00:18:04,575 --> 00:18:06,276
Doraemon!

208
00:18:07,116 --> 00:18:08,985
Instan Wardrobe Cam!

209
00:18:09,609 --> 00:18:12,079
Draw an outfit.

210
00:18:13,046 --> 00:18:14,414
Sketchbook, please?

211
00:18:14,435 --> 00:18:17,138
- Make it cute.
- You got it.

212
00:18:19,156 --> 00:18:20,758
Say cheese!

213
00:18:23,925 --> 00:18:25,928
You pervert!

214
00:18:26,781 --> 00:18:29,584
Speedwinder!

215
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:35,631
Put this on and it'll speed you up.

216
00:18:37,224 --> 00:18:42,029
You sure are working hard today.
Doraemon is helping, isn't he?

217
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:44,692
- I'm finished!
- You are?

218
00:18:45,477 --> 00:18:47,547
Helping your mom?
Good for you.

219
00:18:48,696 --> 00:18:51,131
Will you clean the living room now?

220
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,251
Okay!

221
00:18:54,183 --> 00:18:56,185
Gulliver Tunnel!

222
00:18:58,306 --> 00:19:00,107
So big!

223
00:19:05,138 --> 00:19:06,139
Yippee!!!

224
00:19:07,775 --> 00:19:10,079
Underground Treehouse!

225
00:19:14,855 --> 00:19:16,557
Extra Hot Cloud Spray!

226
00:19:24,757 --> 00:19:27,126
Shizuka! Good morning!

227
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,722
Good Morning, Noby!

228
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:33,814
You're on a roll these days.
Thanks to Doraemon?

229
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:38,776
Yeah. I feel like I can do anything.

230
00:19:39,717 --> 00:19:42,353
Shizuka! Can I talk to you?

231
00:19:42,396 --> 00:19:43,396
Sure.

232
00:19:47,665 --> 00:19:50,768
Oh yeah! I forgot about him.

233
00:19:51,662 --> 00:19:55,633
Good at sports. Good at school work.

234
00:19:56,248 --> 00:19:59,952
And a really nice guy.
My classmate Ace...

235
00:20:00,995 --> 00:20:04,799
Hey, Noby. You're early again.

236
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:14,547
You're saying no matter how much
you use gadgets of the future...

237
00:20:14,578 --> 00:20:19,683
...you can't beat your classmate Ace.

238
00:20:21,891 --> 00:20:23,393
Don't underistimate me!

239
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:26,192
I'm a cat-shaped robot from 22nd century.

240
00:20:26,203 --> 00:20:28,405
There's nothing I can't do!

241
00:20:29,293 --> 00:20:32,896
Hang on. I'll find
a gadget that will make Shizuka...

242
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,903
...fall in love with you.

243
00:20:37,356 --> 00:20:38,958
Imprinting Egg!

244
00:20:40,353 --> 00:20:41,354
What's this?

245
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:44,732
Know about imprinting?

246
00:20:47,582 --> 00:20:49,684
I guess you wouldn't.

247
00:20:50,492 --> 00:20:54,896
Some animals, especially birds
treat the first thing they...

248
00:20:54,943 --> 00:20:58,547
...see as their parent.

249
00:20:58,778 --> 00:21:03,483
Even a toy bird.

250
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,032
This is called imprinting.

251
00:21:06,129 --> 00:21:07,632
Do you understand?

252
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,479
You have no brains.

253
00:21:15,183 --> 00:21:20,556
Putting it simply,
get Shizuka this egg.

254
00:21:20,604 --> 00:21:24,908
Close it and a timer will start.

255
00:21:24,995 --> 00:21:31,001
15 minutes later, she'll fall
in love with the person she sees.

256
00:21:31,017 --> 00:21:33,720
Why you didn't tell me in the beginning?

257
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:37,868
What an amazing gadget.

258
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:44,508
Shizuka's heart will be mine.

259
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:49,841
This gadget is very powerful.

260
00:21:50,194 --> 00:21:53,697
It has complete control over its subjects.

261
00:21:53,754 --> 00:21:57,558
Me, I wouldn't use such a cowardly gadget.

262
00:21:59,505 --> 00:22:04,310
No, Noby. Wait!

263
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:08,932
Boy, it's heavy.

264
00:22:12,788 --> 00:22:14,490
Stop!

265
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:16,953
Big G! Stop it!

266
00:22:32,888 --> 00:22:35,024
Are you okay?

267
00:22:35,841 --> 00:22:39,312
He's in the egg, which means...

268
00:22:41,046 --> 00:22:43,849
Noby honey...

269
00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:50,671
Go! Go!

270
00:22:52,379 --> 00:22:54,448
What's this?

271
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,683
Hi Big G, what are you doing?

272
00:23:03,699 --> 00:23:06,770
That was expensive, you know?

273
00:23:08,376 --> 00:23:10,077
You're so cute!

274
00:23:11,336 --> 00:23:13,605
You just noticed?

275
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:20,223
I just got this. It's crushed

276
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:24,884
Sneech! I'll never let you go again!

277
00:23:24,887 --> 00:23:26,889
Okay?

278
00:23:28,693 --> 00:23:30,795
Help me!

279
00:23:32,223 --> 00:23:34,157
Why you running?

280
00:23:35,558 --> 00:23:37,893
Holy cow, that's strong.

281
00:23:38,193 --> 00:23:39,995
Phew, that was close.

282
00:23:40,533 --> 00:23:45,238
I don't think you should use it.

283
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,491
Why not?

284
00:23:46,991 --> 00:23:50,328
You saw what happened.
It's a bad idea.

285
00:23:50,351 --> 00:23:53,154
I wanna be popular too.

286
00:23:55,636 --> 00:23:58,206
Are you sure about this?

287
00:23:58,296 --> 00:23:59,297
Yes.

288
00:24:00,332 --> 00:24:02,133
Let's have Shizuka enter it here.

289
00:24:02,144 --> 00:24:04,146
How?

290
00:24:04,513 --> 00:24:06,782
- See you.
- Yeah, see you.

291
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:13,535
Yes, Doraemon!

292
00:24:14,275 --> 00:24:18,746
- What's that hole?
- Anywhere Hole!

293
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:21,251
It's connected to Shizuka's front door.

294
00:24:22,612 --> 00:24:27,717
That's great!
Now we wait for 15 minutes, right?

295
00:24:27,845 --> 00:24:28,846
Go on and get out of here.

296
00:24:29,443 --> 00:24:34,048
I don't want her
to see you by mistake.

297
00:24:39,322 --> 00:24:44,728
I can hardly wait for 15 minutes.
When she comes out...

298
00:24:44,804 --> 00:24:47,506
Hey, Noby!

299
00:24:48,184 --> 00:24:50,186
Now what?

300
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:57,797
That weird egg! It's Doraemon's, right?

301
00:24:57,901 --> 00:25:01,404
I need help! Do something!

302
00:25:01,523 --> 00:25:03,725
I'm busy right now.

303
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:06,740
Big G right around the corner.

304
00:25:07,042 --> 00:25:09,811
Sunie-poo! Where are you?

305
00:25:13,474 --> 00:25:16,077
He's here! Move!

306
00:25:16,441 --> 00:25:18,043
Oh, I forgot!

307
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:20,244
Shizuka!

308
00:25:24,254 --> 00:25:25,923
Go get Doraemon!

309
00:25:26,888 --> 00:25:31,525
- Where is he?
- Go find him.

310
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:38,463
There you are, Sunie-poo!

311
00:25:41,104 --> 00:25:44,307
You're my everything!

312
00:25:45,398 --> 00:25:47,100
Help! Mommy!

313
00:25:48,435 --> 00:25:53,139
Shizuka!

314
00:25:54,718 --> 00:25:58,255
Noby, What's going on?

315
00:26:05,616 --> 00:26:08,018
How could you let this happen?

316
00:26:08,402 --> 00:26:10,906
I told you it was a bad idea.

317
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:13,032
Please! You have to put her back!

318
00:26:14,421 --> 00:26:19,125
What? This will fix her but...

319
00:26:19,189 --> 00:26:21,693
Ace?

320
00:26:23,412 --> 00:26:25,414
Don't you like me?

321
00:26:25,753 --> 00:26:27,654
Of course I do.

322
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,840
I like you a lot too.

323
00:26:31,908 --> 00:26:36,780
But I don't want to rely on a gadget.

324
00:26:45,584 --> 00:26:47,986
He won't use a gadget...

325
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:56,803
I like you even more than before.

326
00:26:56,851 --> 00:26:58,553
Ace...

327
00:27:03,517 --> 00:27:07,587
He's impressive.

328
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:08,961
He's just too perfect.

329
00:27:10,175 --> 00:27:12,777
But me, on the other hand...

330
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:22,466
You're klutzy and slow
and you hate to study.

331
00:27:22,544 --> 00:27:23,545
Shut up.

332
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:26,912
- Timid, lazy, dense.
- Leave me alone.

333
00:27:26,942 --> 00:27:29,144
Bad at sports and a coward.

334
00:27:29,197 --> 00:27:31,199
Forgetful, unreliable, goof-off...

335
00:27:37,242 --> 00:27:41,913
You're so lame that
you can't be compared to Ace.

336
00:27:43,874 --> 00:27:45,408
You don't have to be so mean.

337
00:27:46,183 --> 00:27:50,520
Now you know you can't
make the gadgets do all the work.

338
00:27:50,596 --> 00:27:52,598
You yourself also have to make effort.

339
00:27:53,707 --> 00:27:56,610
Me, huh?

340
00:28:01,469 --> 00:28:05,340
- Galaxy!
- Whoa! But that's...

341
00:28:08,014 --> 00:28:11,585
I'm not good at anything.

342
00:28:13,535 --> 00:28:17,839
If you don't at least try,
you'll never change.

343
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,805
You're okay with that?

344
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,043
Good night.

345
00:28:44,671 --> 00:28:46,673
110 times 6 is...

346
00:28:50,301 --> 00:28:54,639
660. Yes! I'm right.

347
00:28:55,234 --> 00:29:02,342
Next. 120 divided by 6...
This is hard.

348
00:29:02,642 --> 00:29:07,146
What's going on?
Studying so early in the morning.

349
00:29:08,571 --> 00:29:12,174
Did I wake you? Sorry.

350
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:14,834
I thought about it.

351
00:29:15,461 --> 00:29:20,466
I'm gonna try not to
get a zero on my next test.

352
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:31,669
Mom gave me more allowance today.

353
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:34,191
Look. Noby's studying.

354
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:39,985
Wow! I'm so impresses Noby!

355
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:41,431
38.

356
00:29:41,469 --> 00:29:43,371
- 120 divided by 3.
- 40.

357
00:29:43,504 --> 00:29:45,407
- 13 x 5.
- 65.

358
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:47,736
- 25 x 3.
- 75.

359
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:50,012
800.

360
00:29:56,372 --> 00:30:02,277
Good luck on your test tomorrow.
I'm sure you'll do great.

361
00:30:12,619 --> 00:30:15,522
There you are.

362
00:30:15,951 --> 00:30:17,854
Here, Sneech.

363
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,003
You're acting so weird, Noby.

364
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:26,051
I'm not the guy I used to be.

365
00:30:26,612 --> 00:30:30,517
You better not get a good score.

366
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:35,357
Then I'll apologize right now. Sorry.

367
00:30:35,797 --> 00:30:37,599
Okay, Start.

368
00:30:42,806 --> 00:30:44,608
Oh my God! No!

369
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:53,297
Noby, you got a zero.

370
00:30:54,147 --> 00:30:58,552
- Again?
- I'm sorry.

371
00:30:58,902 --> 00:31:02,673
At this rate, you'll flunk elementary school.

372
00:31:02,767 --> 00:31:06,171
I'm worried about your future.

373
00:31:07,334 --> 00:31:10,470
I'm so reassuring to
have Noby in the same class.

374
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:15,405
Don't be so smug.
You only got 10 points

375
00:31:15,714 --> 00:31:17,783
It's not that different.

376
00:31:20,973 --> 00:31:23,877
Noby!

377
00:31:25,527 --> 00:31:28,362
- How was the test?
- Don't ask.

378
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:33,446
Come on. You studied so hard.
I bet you did well.

379
00:31:33,487 --> 00:31:35,222
I'm not telling you.

380
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:37,392
Don't be so shy.

381
00:31:37,775 --> 00:31:39,176
Allright. Bring-It-Bag!

382
00:31:41,434 --> 00:31:46,507
I'll just fetch
the test paper from Noby's bag.

383
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,483
What? Japanese Test?

384
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:54,094
You were studying for a math test.

385
00:31:59,139 --> 00:32:01,641
I can't stand this!

386
00:32:02,137 --> 00:32:05,173
I can't stand myself anymore!

387
00:32:05,245 --> 00:32:07,147
Noby...

388
00:32:07,147 --> 00:32:09,449
Leave me alone.

389
00:32:14,863 --> 00:32:17,534
Be careful when you run!

390
00:32:17,946 --> 00:32:21,349
See what I mean?
Are you okay?

391
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:24,453
Come on, sweetie.

392
00:32:35,514 --> 00:32:37,718
I made up my mind.

393
00:32:39,512 --> 00:32:41,814
Hi, Noby.
What are you doing?

394
00:32:47,072 --> 00:32:48,975
He's being weird.

395
00:32:49,862 --> 00:32:53,365
- Mom, I need a favor.
- I'm not buying you anything.

396
00:32:53,463 --> 00:32:57,867
It's nothing like that.
Let's move somewhere far away.

397
00:32:57,895 --> 00:33:02,367
Don't be silly.
Why do we have to move?

398
00:33:02,422 --> 00:33:07,027
Then let me go study abroad.
How about the U. S?

399
00:33:07,126 --> 00:33:11,231
Stop talking nonsense
or you'll be in trouble.

400
00:33:14,727 --> 00:33:19,298
I'll just have to take
matters into my own hands.

401
00:33:19,926 --> 00:33:25,465
Noby, you tried really hard.
Don't worry about failing.

402
00:33:25,826 --> 00:33:29,730
If other people can do it,
so can you.

403
00:33:29,802 --> 00:33:31,304
Here it is.

404
00:33:31,499 --> 00:33:33,701
Are you listening to me?

405
00:33:37,514 --> 00:33:40,417
It doesn't matter anymore.

406
00:33:41,642 --> 00:33:45,646
I'm giving up on marrying Shizuka.

407
00:33:45,937 --> 00:33:48,272
Why?
You don't like her anymore?

408
00:33:48,615 --> 00:33:51,618
Yes I do!
I like her a lot!

409
00:33:52,983 --> 00:33:57,087
She's everything to me.

410
00:33:57,863 --> 00:34:01,066
Then why?

411
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:03,836
I thought hard about it?

412
00:34:03,892 --> 00:34:09,398
If she marries me,
She'll be unhappy forever.

413
00:34:11,253 --> 00:34:15,992
Until now,
I only thought about myself.

414
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:22,055
But If I really do care about Shizuka...

415
00:34:22,112 --> 00:34:24,615
...she's better of without me.

416
00:34:27,495 --> 00:34:32,100
It's hard saying goodbye. But...

417
00:34:32,741 --> 00:34:38,047
It's harder thinking that
I'll be making her unhappy.

418
00:34:42,263 --> 00:34:44,332
Shizuka! Nobiy is here!

419
00:34:44,848 --> 00:34:46,050
I'm taking a bath.

420
00:34:46,426 --> 00:34:50,431
I just came to return some books.

421
00:34:53,102 --> 00:34:56,405
I'll always be wishing
for Shizuka's happiness.

422
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:03,596
Tell her I said goodbye.

423
00:35:03,934 --> 00:35:05,636
Noby?

424
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:18,285
I'm doing the right thing.

425
00:35:18,481 --> 00:35:20,684
Noby!

426
00:35:27,392 --> 00:35:31,364
What's the matter?
Are you angry at me?

427
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,441
Don't ask.

428
00:35:32,786 --> 00:35:35,789
We better not see each other anymore.

429
00:35:35,905 --> 00:35:39,108
I won't leave until you say why.

430
00:35:39,154 --> 00:35:42,358
What am I supposed to do?!

431
00:35:44,499 --> 00:35:46,501
I'll make her hate me.

432
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:59,040
Jerk!

433
00:36:00,961 --> 00:36:03,131
I hate you.

434
00:36:06,516 --> 00:36:10,153
He's really serious.

435
00:36:10,181 --> 00:36:13,084
I can't believe he did that.

436
00:36:20,805 --> 00:36:24,543
I'm doing the right thing.
But it's tough.

437
00:36:26,275 --> 00:36:28,778
Noby, what are you doing?

438
00:36:30,153 --> 00:36:33,556
Ace! You're a good guy.

439
00:36:33,573 --> 00:36:36,277
Take good care of Shizuka.

440
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:50,077
Nobiy, want a yummy bun?
These are especially good.

441
00:36:50,133 --> 00:36:52,134
No! I'm not in the mood.

442
00:36:52,747 --> 00:36:55,617
- Just a bite.
- I'm not like you.

443
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:56,712
Just eat it!

444
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,652
I said, I don't want it!

445
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:02,433
I don't usually share my yummy buns!

446
00:37:03,108 --> 00:37:06,611
Noby's acting real weird.

447
00:37:06,923 --> 00:37:09,125
I agree.

448
00:37:09,451 --> 00:37:13,322
Noby's really depressed about
getting a zero on that test.

449
00:37:14,058 --> 00:37:15,226
I would be too.

450
00:37:15,345 --> 00:37:17,848
If Mr. S told me I might flunk...

451
00:37:19,472 --> 00:37:23,509
...I'd be hating life.

452
00:37:23,518 --> 00:37:27,621
 <i>Tell her I said goodbye.</i>

453
00:37:28,266 --> 00:37:29,268
Oh, no.

454
00:37:33,049 --> 00:37:35,852
- Noby!
- It's Shizuka!

455
00:37:35,926 --> 00:37:39,731
- I know you're there!
- Yikes!!

456
00:37:39,768 --> 00:37:42,570
- Come here
- What should I do?

457
00:37:42,612 --> 00:37:46,316
- Noby!
- I have to make her hate me.

458
00:37:46,341 --> 00:37:48,142
Don't be stupid.

459
00:37:48,151 --> 00:37:51,455
That would put me
in a tight spot as well.

460
00:37:51,527 --> 00:37:54,029
Just do something!

461
00:37:56,298 --> 00:37:59,568
- If you insist...
- Hurry up!!

462
00:37:59,637 --> 00:38:03,141
Despica-portion!
This should do it.

463
00:38:03,237 --> 00:38:06,540
Noby! Shizuka is here!

464
00:38:06,847 --> 00:38:10,683
It'll make Shizuka hate you.
So will everyone else too.

465
00:38:10,879 --> 00:38:14,884
Got it?
One sip was enough!

466
00:38:20,989 --> 00:38:24,994
Nothing's happening.

467
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:35,973
What's wrong, Doraemon?

468
00:38:38,254 --> 00:38:42,858
Doraemon?

469
00:38:47,638 --> 00:38:49,672
I don't feel well.

470
00:38:51,514 --> 00:38:55,051
I can't stand it,
Just being close to you...

471
00:38:55,705 --> 00:38:58,408
You make me sick!

472
00:39:08,185 --> 00:39:14,991
I drank too much.
I feel sick.

473
00:39:15,003 --> 00:39:17,206
Help!

474
00:39:17,256 --> 00:39:19,358
Oh, no...

475
00:39:32,327 --> 00:39:34,429
I'm going to die.

476
00:39:57,914 --> 00:40:01,618
Noby...

477
00:40:05,563 --> 00:40:08,165
Shizuka...

478
00:40:12,019 --> 00:40:15,222
Get it out.
You'll feel better.

479
00:40:16,636 --> 00:40:17,637
Go on.

480
00:40:24,584 --> 00:40:28,855
How odd... Why was I running?

481
00:40:29,942 --> 00:40:33,547
Phew. I feel better.

482
00:40:33,607 --> 00:40:37,611
I thought you poisoned yourself.

483
00:40:40,548 --> 00:40:44,720
Were you that worried about me?

484
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,203
Of course I was! You're my friend!

485
00:40:48,296 --> 00:40:51,900
And don't be so weak!
It's just Mr. S!

486
00:40:54,419 --> 00:40:55,553
You jerk.

487
00:40:56,296 --> 00:40:58,598
Jerk.

488
00:40:58,642 --> 00:41:03,647
Oh, boy... that was really tough.

489
00:41:03,715 --> 00:41:07,219
Oh my God! Why?!?

490
00:41:09,018 --> 00:41:11,920
She was so mad at me.

491
00:41:17,756 --> 00:41:20,391
The stars are so pretty tonight.

492
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:27,521
What's the matter?

493
00:41:28,066 --> 00:41:33,138
You see, because of today's events,
your future has started to...

494
00:41:33,169 --> 00:41:34,170
I'm not telling you.

495
00:41:35,332 --> 00:41:36,868
What are you talking about?

496
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:40,498
Nothing.
If I tell you, you'll get lazy.

497
00:41:40,506 --> 00:41:44,009
Oh, come on.
Tell me. Just a little bit.

498
00:41:47,979 --> 00:41:50,514
- Tell me!
- Why should I?

499
00:41:50,582 --> 00:41:53,785
- I said tell me!
- That tickles.

500
00:41:55,129 --> 00:41:57,298
It's dangerous up here.

501
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:58,308
You're right.

502
00:41:59,088 --> 00:42:02,992
When your future
is starting to look good...

503
00:42:02,994 --> 00:42:05,296
What? Look good?

504
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:07,841
Wanna take a peek?

505
00:42:07,862 --> 00:42:10,466
Oh yeah!

506
00:42:11,586 --> 00:42:14,789
Where did it go? Let me see.

507
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:15,811
Here it is!

508
00:42:16,045 --> 00:42:18,314
At this point...

509
00:42:18,794 --> 00:42:20,530
...this is your future.

510
00:42:26,086 --> 00:42:27,420
A grown-up Shizuka.

511
00:42:28,259 --> 00:42:29,460
She's so pretty.

512
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,612
The boy gettng a spanking
looks exactly like you.

513
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:36,521
That means...

514
00:42:39,347 --> 00:42:42,919
I must have married...

515
00:42:43,463 --> 00:42:45,565
Shizuka!?

516
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:56,194
Yes! Yes!

517
00:42:56,252 --> 00:42:58,254
This is awesome!!

518
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:03,308
Thank you, Doraemon.
I owe everything to you.

519
00:43:03,897 --> 00:43:06,266
You're wrong, Noby.

520
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:09,172
Out of the millions of possibilities...

521
00:43:09,657 --> 00:43:12,759
...you grabbed the opportunity.

522
00:43:12,818 --> 00:43:15,522
My future changed.

523
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:17,912
Your new future.

524
00:43:17,931 --> 00:43:22,535
Yeah, my new future.

525
00:43:22,538 --> 00:43:27,744
Your kindness is about
to change the future.

526
00:43:36,985 --> 00:43:39,320
Will you marry me?

527
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:41,392
Yes, I'd love to.

528
00:43:41,413 --> 00:43:47,620
You're proposing to her?!
That's not fair!

529
00:43:54,591 --> 00:43:58,596
No, Noby.
We're practicing for Cinderella.

530
00:43:58,912 --> 00:44:01,648
We're putting on a play.

531
00:44:03,606 --> 00:44:04,606
What?

532
00:44:05,298 --> 00:44:07,668
It's not working.

533
00:44:08,743 --> 00:44:11,379
Actually I was surprised too.

534
00:44:11,451 --> 00:44:14,921
Why would Shizuka marry you?

535
00:44:15,001 --> 00:44:18,004
There's so many better guys out there.

536
00:44:18,006 --> 00:44:19,008
Watch it!

537
00:44:19,704 --> 00:44:23,108
When my future was
starting to look good...

538
00:44:24,518 --> 00:44:28,489
She might end up marrying Ace.

539
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:33,181
If you're that worried,
let's watch Time TV.

540
00:44:35,113 --> 00:44:37,115
You're supposed to get engaged...

541
00:44:37,802 --> 00:44:41,407
...14 years from now on Oct 25.

542
00:44:41,922 --> 00:44:44,758
So let's see what
happened a little before that.

543
00:44:44,788 --> 00:44:46,790
Are you serious?

544
00:44:52,674 --> 00:44:55,377
That's you grown up.

545
00:44:55,678 --> 00:44:57,913
Same as ever.

546
00:44:58,458 --> 00:45:01,462
Mountain climbing?

547
00:45:01,535 --> 00:45:04,138
Are you going or not?

548
00:45:04,597 --> 00:45:05,598
That's Shizuka.

549
00:45:05,737 --> 00:45:09,140
I want to.
But I hate climbing.

550
00:45:09,222 --> 00:45:11,725
I would if the mountain's flat.

551
00:45:12,778 --> 00:45:14,112
You need to grow up.

552
00:45:14,951 --> 00:45:18,354
Whatever. I'll take another friend.

553
00:45:24,916 --> 00:45:27,585
I can't watch this.
Fast forward it.

554
00:45:30,259 --> 00:45:31,260
What?

555
00:45:31,654 --> 00:45:33,456
Shizuka's alone.

556
00:45:33,507 --> 00:45:35,510
She must have gotten
separated in the blizzard.

557
00:45:36,121 --> 00:45:39,024
- She's in trouble!
- You're right.

558
00:45:39,093 --> 00:45:41,595
What's grown-up Noby doing?

559
00:45:42,425 --> 00:45:45,229
In bed with a cold.

560
00:45:45,304 --> 00:45:47,406
Oh, man.

561
00:45:48,589 --> 00:45:52,893
Wait. I got it!

562
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:55,316
Time Kerchief, please.

563
00:45:55,721 --> 00:45:58,790
What are you gonna do with it?

564
00:45:58,862 --> 00:46:01,965
This fast forward things, right?

565
00:46:06,536 --> 00:46:08,037
14 years from now.

566
00:46:08,103 --> 00:46:12,107
I'll ride the Time Machine
and go save Shizuka.

567
00:46:12,161 --> 00:46:14,363
Are you okay, Shizuka?

568
00:46:15,062 --> 00:46:21,803
You're wonderful, Noby!
And we'll get married.

569
00:46:23,285 --> 00:46:25,687
Will it work that well?

570
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:29,050
I'll go get ready!

571
00:46:29,361 --> 00:46:31,763
I'm ready.

572
00:46:31,857 --> 00:46:33,158
Come on. Let's go to the future.

573
00:46:36,022 --> 00:46:37,523
Wait a second.

574
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:40,363
You're not thinking thoroughly.

575
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:44,083
Using the Time Machine
could change the future again.

576
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:45,931
What?

577
00:46:45,972 --> 00:46:49,276
It doesn't necessarily
change for the better.

578
00:46:50,225 --> 00:46:53,361
You're so dramatic.

579
00:46:53,441 --> 00:46:55,343
I have to hurry
and go save her.

580
00:47:00,006 --> 00:47:05,244
Hang on tight. If you fall off,
you'll be lost forever in time.

581
00:47:05,512 --> 00:47:08,748
Okay. Here we go then.

582
00:47:27,218 --> 00:47:30,655
My house is a public toilet.

583
00:47:30,707 --> 00:47:34,011
The neighborhood turned into a park.

584
00:47:35,141 --> 00:47:36,142
Everything's so different.

585
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:40,965
Let's go. Get out Anywhere Door.

586
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:44,665
You make me work hard.

587
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:48,413
Take me to Shizuka!

588
00:47:54,005 --> 00:47:55,807
There she is!

589
00:47:56,616 --> 00:48:01,420
You stay behind.
I'm going to save her without your help.

590
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:04,341
Shizuka!

591
00:48:04,746 --> 00:48:06,648
Good luck.

592
00:48:15,913 --> 00:48:18,315
Shizuka!

593
00:48:20,985 --> 00:48:22,987
It can't be...

594
00:48:23,263 --> 00:48:24,665
Shizu!

595
00:48:24,815 --> 00:48:27,752
The cottage is still far away.

596
00:48:28,896 --> 00:48:29,897
Shi!

597
00:48:30,689 --> 00:48:35,026
It's been 3 hours
since we got separated.

598
00:48:37,274 --> 00:48:41,411
Shizuka, you okay?!

599
00:48:42,262 --> 00:48:44,264
It's me, Noby.

600
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:50,421
Noby? Why are you here?

601
00:48:51,243 --> 00:48:53,312
It doesn't matter.

602
00:48:53,362 --> 00:48:56,365
Everything will be
fine now that I'm here.

603
00:48:56,397 --> 00:49:00,402
When you're lost in a snowstorm,
don't walk around blind.

604
00:49:00,422 --> 00:49:04,325
First of all, check the map.
This is the iron rule.

605
00:49:07,904 --> 00:49:09,506
Uh-oh...

606
00:49:10,431 --> 00:49:14,901
That's a world map.
That's so you.

607
00:49:16,576 --> 00:49:21,514
This Auto Compass
will show us the direction.

608
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,602
That's convenient.

609
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:31,867
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

610
00:49:32,906 --> 00:49:38,644
When we were kids, Doraemon would
come to your recue at times like this.

611
00:49:40,712 --> 00:49:42,615
What did you say?

612
00:49:42,936 --> 00:49:46,339
I wonder how Doraemon is doing.

613
00:49:47,478 --> 00:49:50,014
Probably taking a nap or something.

614
00:49:52,153 --> 00:49:54,789
Oh, Noby... You're so silly.

615
00:49:54,983 --> 00:49:57,986
Just like a kid.

616
00:49:58,071 --> 00:49:59,072
Kid?! She knows?!

617
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:03,294
There's a cave.
Let's take a break.

618
00:50:05,998 --> 00:50:09,134
We have to make sure
we don't freeze to death.

619
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:11,783
Let's start a fire.

620
00:50:13,774 --> 00:50:15,910
The matches are wet.

621
00:50:16,299 --> 00:50:19,402
No worries.
I know how to start a fire.

622
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:23,853
I just have to rub
2 sticks together.

623
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:25,713
Now's my chance.

624
00:50:25,728 --> 00:50:27,329
I have to...

625
00:50:27,422 --> 00:50:30,324
Impress her.

626
00:50:30,393 --> 00:50:32,795
It's not working.

627
00:50:33,508 --> 00:50:35,611
Want my lighter?

628
00:50:41,272 --> 00:50:43,074
Why didn't you tell me?

629
00:50:45,117 --> 00:50:47,153
I didn't want to interrupt.

630
00:50:51,408 --> 00:50:53,410
Do you have a cold?

631
00:50:53,838 --> 00:50:57,509
I don't feel too well
but it's no big deal.

632
00:50:58,458 --> 00:51:00,727
She caught it
from the grown-up Noby.

633
00:51:01,163 --> 00:51:03,132
Nothing.

634
00:51:03,574 --> 00:51:08,413
When you came to see me,
I must have given it to you.

635
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:13,003
It's my fault.
I don't take good care of myself.

636
00:51:17,601 --> 00:51:20,538
Wear this. I'll be fine.

637
00:51:22,641 --> 00:51:24,242
It's wet.

638
00:51:24,604 --> 00:51:27,739
Your clothes must be wet too.
Aren't you cold?

639
00:51:28,678 --> 00:51:31,882
Now that you mention it...
I'm cold.

640
00:51:31,997 --> 00:51:34,199
You better take them off.

641
00:51:34,225 --> 00:51:35,226
I don't have change.

642
00:51:37,615 --> 00:51:39,416
I have an emergency blanket.

643
00:51:40,199 --> 00:51:41,201
Thanks.

644
00:51:47,754 --> 00:51:49,756
This is really warm.

645
00:51:50,109 --> 00:51:51,511
I'm glad.

646
00:52:08,115 --> 00:52:11,118
Is your cold getting worse?

647
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:16,074
What should we do?
You could die!

648
00:52:16,151 --> 00:52:19,855
Don't say that.

649
00:52:20,288 --> 00:52:21,890
You really haven't changed at all.

650
00:52:22,675 --> 00:52:28,081
I worry about you.
You need someone to look after you.

651
00:52:28,257 --> 00:52:38,567
Yeah... allright.
The answer to your question is...

652
00:52:38,579 --> 00:52:40,081
Yes.

653
00:52:42,913 --> 00:52:47,652
I thought you'd be happier.

654
00:52:51,088 --> 00:52:54,191
Shizuka!

655
00:52:54,238 --> 00:52:57,008
What should I do?

656
00:52:57,064 --> 00:53:01,168
Help, Help, Doraemon!

657
00:53:01,711 --> 00:53:02,712
Doraemon!!

658
00:53:07,468 --> 00:53:10,738
This nice weather
is making me drowsy.

659
00:53:11,138 --> 00:53:13,240
Shizuka!

660
00:53:15,757 --> 00:53:18,560
I'll take her to Anywhere Door.

661
00:53:28,294 --> 00:53:30,096
This yummy bun is so yummy...

662
00:53:31,301 --> 00:53:33,570
I'll share one with you...

663
00:53:43,241 --> 00:53:46,444
It should be somewhere around here.

664
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:55,965
Warning. Pulse rate is dropping.
Contact a physician immediately.

665
00:53:56,568 --> 00:53:57,569
Oh, no!

666
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:02,471
Ha! The Auto Compass!

667
00:54:15,565 --> 00:54:16,966
I twisted my ankle.

668
00:54:18,448 --> 00:54:22,185
I even lost my glasses.
Ican't see anything.

669
00:54:22,279 --> 00:54:25,682
Using the Time Machine
could change the future again.

670
00:54:25,748 --> 00:54:29,751
Oh my God! What should I do?!

671
00:54:30,572 --> 00:54:33,543
It doesn't necessarily
change for the better.

672
00:54:33,775 --> 00:54:35,644
This isn't ehat I wanted!

673
00:54:36,086 --> 00:54:38,889
Please! Shizuka will die!

674
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:41,177
I'll study!
I'll do anything!

675
00:54:41,254 --> 00:54:42,655
I'll change!

676
00:54:43,873 --> 00:54:46,108
What are you doing?!

677
00:54:49,865 --> 00:54:51,800
I didn't think thoroughly.

678
00:54:59,099 --> 00:55:00,100
It's my fault.

679
00:55:00,921 --> 00:55:03,290
I have to do something by myself.

680
00:55:03,306 --> 00:55:05,509
There must be a way.

681
00:55:11,088 --> 00:55:13,122
I have to believe in him

682
00:55:16,737 --> 00:55:20,507
The watch is still working.

683
00:55:20,858 --> 00:55:23,460
I memorized the time
and the year right now.

684
00:55:23,466 --> 00:55:25,568
Now it's up to the grown-up Noby.
I'll believe in myself.

685
00:55:25,602 --> 00:55:29,807
Go! This memory!
Please, future me!

686
00:55:29,815 --> 00:55:31,917
Remember this incindent!

687
00:55:32,512 --> 00:55:38,752
I wouldn't forget
the biggest crisis of my life!

688
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:41,222
Go! Go!

689
00:55:41,247 --> 00:55:42,247
Go!

690
00:55:43,092 --> 00:55:44,894
This memory!

691
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:41,831
Hey!

692
00:56:42,919 --> 00:56:43,920
Hey!

693
00:56:44,545 --> 00:56:47,481
The memory reached him!

694
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:52,546
Hey! You guys okay?!

695
00:57:09,573 --> 00:57:10,574
You remembered.

696
00:57:11,472 --> 00:57:16,711
Yeah. I was in bed with
a cold and suddenly remembered.

697
00:57:17,127 --> 00:57:20,631
It's like the memory
flew into my head.

698
00:57:20,668 --> 00:57:21,669
It felt weird.

699
00:57:23,435 --> 00:57:26,772
I didn't know why
I had forgotten it.

700
00:57:27,536 --> 00:57:32,941
Then I couldn't sit still
anymore and rushed to come here.

701
00:57:33,375 --> 00:57:35,376
I was scared.

702
00:57:37,786 --> 00:57:41,189
You're okay now.
Your plan worked.

703
00:57:41,844 --> 00:57:45,147
It's weird saying
this to myself but...

704
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:48,143
Thanks for believing in me.

705
00:57:52,345 --> 00:57:54,948
I only had me to rely on.

706
00:57:55,516 --> 00:57:58,687
Thanks for relying on me.

707
00:58:00,941 --> 00:58:04,377
Now let's hurry.
I'm worried about Shizuka.

708
00:58:20,514 --> 00:58:21,515
He's back.

709
00:58:28,134 --> 00:58:32,673
- How is she?
- She was in real danger.

710
00:58:32,719 --> 00:58:36,222
But she's okay.
She'll be fine.

711
00:58:36,391 --> 00:58:38,793
Thanks to you.

712
00:58:38,966 --> 00:58:41,570
That's great.

713
00:58:43,729 --> 00:58:45,731
Huh?

714
00:58:45,821 --> 00:58:46,822
Doraemon.

715
00:58:48,513 --> 00:58:51,016
- Yeah.
- Shall I go get him?

716
00:58:53,544 --> 00:58:55,846
No, Don't.

717
00:58:56,691 --> 00:58:58,693
Why not?

718
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:02,505
Doraemon is your...

719
00:59:03,415 --> 00:59:06,118
My friend from childhood.

720
00:59:06,407 --> 00:59:09,543
Cherish your time with him.

721
00:59:13,404 --> 00:59:16,807
I should go home.
I feel a fever coming on.

722
00:59:16,814 --> 00:59:22,420
Yeah. Um... Thanks, me.

723
00:59:22,514 --> 00:59:24,416
Take car, me.

724
00:59:24,437 --> 00:59:25,437
See ya.

725
00:59:26,265 --> 00:59:31,070
The grown-up Shizuka said
something before she passed out!

726
00:59:31,608 --> 00:59:33,610
She said something?

727
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:36,800
She said her answer is yes!

728
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:40,042
Her answer is yes?

729
00:59:40,934 --> 00:59:42,936
What?!

730
00:59:45,441 --> 00:59:47,544
Again...

731
00:59:48,283 --> 00:59:50,151
Tell me again!

732
00:59:50,414 --> 00:59:55,418
The grown-up Shizuka said
her answer to your question is yes.

733
00:59:56,704 --> 01:00:00,508
That's... That's...

734
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:02,792
That's!

735
01:00:02,854 --> 01:00:07,559
Ouch! What's the matter?

736
01:00:07,655 --> 01:00:14,061
Yes!! Are you sure she said that?

737
01:00:14,168 --> 01:00:16,169
I don't get it.

738
01:00:18,477 --> 01:00:22,413
I proposed to her.

739
01:00:23,108 --> 01:00:26,044
I'm impressed by me, Noby.

740
01:00:26,471 --> 01:00:30,409
She didn't give me
an answer for a long time.

741
01:00:34,226 --> 01:00:36,161
Are you okay?

742
01:00:37,101 --> 01:00:41,106
I have to go.
I have to go see Shizuka.

743
01:00:44,122 --> 01:00:46,425
Shizuka!!

744
01:00:47,715 --> 01:00:51,219
He completely lost his cool
just because she said yes.

745
01:00:51,304 --> 01:00:53,406
He proposed and she said yes...

746
01:00:57,417 --> 01:00:59,652
We're getting married?

747
01:01:04,132 --> 01:01:07,635
Doraemon!

748
01:01:08,481 --> 01:01:12,286
What? Are you serious?

749
01:01:12,324 --> 01:01:14,025
Really? Really?

750
01:01:14,393 --> 01:01:18,530
Yes! That's wonderful!

751
01:01:19,778 --> 01:01:23,883
Noby, that's great!
I'm so happy for you!

752
01:01:23,939 --> 01:01:31,446
Wow! You're amazing!

753
01:01:38,398 --> 01:01:42,001
- Shall we go watch?
- Yeah. Let's.

754
01:01:46,486 --> 01:01:48,956
The wedding!

755
01:01:50,615 --> 01:01:55,387
- We're here.
- Today's your wedding.

756
01:01:55,401 --> 01:01:58,203
I'm getting nervous.

757
01:01:58,266 --> 01:02:01,369
Look.

758
01:02:01,432 --> 01:02:03,334
On the way to the wedding.

759
01:02:03,352 --> 01:02:05,454
Let's follow!
We need Hopters!

760
01:02:06,209 --> 01:02:08,010
Here.

761
01:02:11,830 --> 01:02:13,231
He's in a rush.

762
01:02:13,237 --> 01:02:17,442
Probably running late
even on a day like this.

763
01:02:24,429 --> 01:02:27,566
Wow, This is the future world.

764
01:02:29,341 --> 01:02:30,542
Naby, watch out!

765
01:02:39,906 --> 01:02:42,108
- Behind you!
- Behind me?

766
01:03:05,068 --> 01:03:07,570
Sorry.

767
01:03:07,970 --> 01:03:09,671
Let's go.

768
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:25,901
I'm oby Nobi!
I'm sorry I'm late!

769
01:03:28,206 --> 01:03:32,478
Your ceremony is scheduled for tomorrow.

770
01:03:32,659 --> 01:03:34,661
What?

771
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:39,036
The wedding is tomorrow.

772
01:03:39,063 --> 01:03:42,666
You may be older but you haven't changed.

773
01:03:42,734 --> 01:03:45,937
Then why did we arrive today?

774
01:03:46,832 --> 01:03:48,667
I made a mistake.

775
01:03:49,157 --> 01:03:51,092
See?
Everyone makes mistakes.

776
01:03:51,109 --> 01:03:56,114
But now that we're here
let's stay and watch you.

777
01:03:56,155 --> 01:03:58,157
Yeah.

778
01:04:00,783 --> 01:04:02,484
Hi, Sneech.

779
01:04:02,567 --> 01:04:05,771
Where are you?
Tonight's your bachelor party.

780
01:04:05,830 --> 01:04:08,633
At Big G's house.

781
01:04:08,668 --> 01:04:09,669
Oh, yeah.

782
01:04:14,492 --> 01:04:19,932
I still can't believe it.
You're getting married tomorrow.

783
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:25,525
I bet Shizuka is gonna
look so pretty tomorrow.

784
01:04:25,543 --> 01:04:28,146
We all had crushes on her.

785
01:04:29,405 --> 01:04:32,976
But she fell for you.

786
01:04:33,036 --> 01:04:35,138
Make her happy, okay?

787
01:04:35,667 --> 01:04:37,570
Yeah.

788
01:04:37,882 --> 01:04:42,587
I wish I were
the one to make her happy.

789
01:04:43,964 --> 01:04:47,735
But she said I can do
everything on my own.

790
01:04:47,811 --> 01:04:51,515
I see. You too, Ace?

791
01:04:51,559 --> 01:04:55,963
- Noby! Stay right there!
- Yeah, stay there.

792
01:04:55,971 --> 01:05:00,977
If it was Ace, I could give up.
But why you?

793
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:03,462
You're just Noby.

794
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:06,896
You're so lucky.

795
01:05:06,973 --> 01:05:09,176
That hurts, Big G.

796
01:05:09,475 --> 01:05:11,477
What's so funny?

797
01:05:11,857 --> 01:05:14,592
Keep it down!
I have a deadline!

798
01:05:14,696 --> 01:05:15,397
Little G.

799
01:05:15,522 --> 01:05:18,225
Hi, Little G.
Long time no see.

800
01:05:18,517 --> 01:05:21,053
Noby, congratulations.
You're getting married.

801
01:05:21,471 --> 01:05:23,740
She became a manga artist.

802
01:05:23,914 --> 01:05:28,785
If you make Shizuka cry,
my pen will coming after you.

803
01:05:29,395 --> 01:05:34,301
I know, I know.
Thank you.

804
01:05:34,436 --> 01:05:36,237
I look so happy.

805
01:05:36,734 --> 01:05:38,502
You're practically drooling.

806
01:05:40,379 --> 01:05:42,315
I can't watch anymore.

807
01:05:42,592 --> 01:05:44,394
I wonder what Shizuka is doing.

808
01:05:44,491 --> 01:05:48,495
Probably crying about
her hasty decision to say yes.

809
01:05:48,775 --> 01:05:52,680
Thanks a lot.
Now I have to go see.

810
01:05:52,769 --> 01:05:54,470
Wait!

811
01:05:59,909 --> 01:06:00,910
Come in.

812
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:08,346
Dad, I'm going to sleep now.
Good night.

813
01:06:09,506 --> 01:06:11,508
Good night.

814
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:14,486
She seems down.

815
01:06:14,523 --> 01:06:17,425
You can't blame her.
She's marrying you.

816
01:06:19,382 --> 01:06:20,383
Good night.

817
01:06:23,525 --> 01:06:27,797
That's it?
But she's getting married tomorrow...

818
01:06:27,832 --> 01:06:31,035
It's hard to talk
at times like this.

819
01:06:31,091 --> 01:06:32,993
Truth Transmitter.

820
01:06:34,049 --> 01:06:36,185
If someone has
something they're holding back...

821
01:06:36,254 --> 01:06:39,757
...this makes them want
to get it off their chest.

822
01:06:40,909 --> 01:06:42,811
Dad!

823
01:06:44,547 --> 01:06:47,250
I want to call off the wedding.

824
01:06:47,845 --> 01:06:49,847
- Why?!
- Dad...

825
01:06:50,473 --> 01:06:51,474
What's wrong?

826
01:06:52,221 --> 01:06:55,090
You'll miss me when I'm gone.

827
01:06:55,473 --> 01:06:57,543
Of course I will.

828
01:06:57,833 --> 01:07:02,470
You and mom have taken
such good care of me.

829
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:04,387
But me...

830
01:07:04,431 --> 01:07:08,035
I haven't done
anything for you in return.

831
01:07:10,428 --> 01:07:12,396
Don't be silly.

832
01:07:12,398 --> 01:07:17,336
You've given us
so many wonderful things.

833
01:07:18,031 --> 01:07:19,833
I have?

834
01:07:20,397 --> 01:07:23,199
So many I lost count.

835
01:07:23,505 --> 01:07:28,743
Your first gift was that you were born.

836
01:07:28,845 --> 01:07:30,447
It was 3 am.

837
01:07:31,343 --> 01:07:35,147
Your first cry sounded
like an angel's trumpet.

838
01:07:35,814 --> 01:07:39,751
The most beautiful music I've ever heard.

839
01:07:39,950 --> 01:07:44,087
When I left the hospital,
the sky was beginning to light up.

840
01:07:45,205 --> 01:07:50,076
But there were still
stars scattered in the sky.

841
01:07:50,523 --> 01:07:52,659
In this vast universe...

842
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:57,597
...a new life was born
carrying my blood.

843
01:07:57,602 --> 01:08:04,042
I was so moved
that I couldn't stop crying.

844
01:08:04,495 --> 01:08:07,698
And everyday,
every year since then...

845
01:08:07,995 --> 01:08:15,703
All the happy memories.
We can't ask for anything better.

846
01:08:15,725 --> 01:08:20,029
We'll miss you but
those memories will keep us happy.

847
01:08:20,082 --> 01:08:24,487
You don't have to worry.

848
01:08:24,586 --> 01:08:27,489
I'm afraid.

849
01:08:27,517 --> 01:08:29,619
Will we be all right?

850
01:08:29,681 --> 01:08:34,186
Sure you will be.
Have faith in Noby.

851
01:08:34,242 --> 01:08:38,947
You were right in choosing him.

852
01:08:38,998 --> 01:08:43,001
He's an ordinary guy
with no particular talent.

853
01:08:43,154 --> 01:08:48,860
But he wants people to be happy
and cries for their pain.

854
01:08:48,871 --> 01:08:53,475
That's what makes a good human being.

855
01:08:53,542 --> 01:08:59,048
I'm confident he will make you happy.

856
01:08:59,066 --> 01:09:04,071
And I'm proud of you for choosing him.

857
01:09:04,162 --> 01:09:09,568
Don't worry.
Everything will work out fine.

858
01:09:11,779 --> 01:09:13,180
Okay.

859
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:21,484
Why don't we watch
the wedding on another day?

860
01:09:21,766 --> 01:09:26,538
Yeah. Let's go back to the present day.

861
01:09:26,583 --> 01:09:29,086
I miss Shizuka, the one in my era.

862
01:09:38,944 --> 01:09:42,315
What's up?
What's so urgent?

863
01:09:42,445 --> 01:09:44,647
- Shizuka...
- Noby?

864
01:09:46,944 --> 01:09:51,616
I'll make you happy.
Forever and ever!

865
01:09:51,853 --> 01:09:56,157
I promise you.

866
01:10:01,911 --> 01:10:04,813
You're so slow, Doraemon!

867
01:10:10,725 --> 01:10:12,628
Doraemon...

868
01:10:14,872 --> 01:10:16,806
Can I borrow a Hopter?

869
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:20,116
Okay, here.

870
01:10:23,534 --> 01:10:24,535
Come here.

871
01:10:25,451 --> 01:10:26,451
What is it?

872
01:10:27,392 --> 01:10:28,393
You see...

873
01:10:30,312 --> 01:10:32,515
Right now...

874
01:10:34,538 --> 01:10:36,540
I'm...

875
01:10:39,709 --> 01:10:42,411
Just say it.

876
01:10:42,419 --> 01:10:47,225
I'm so super happy that I want...

877
01:10:47,288 --> 01:10:50,291
...the whole world to know!

878
01:10:55,973 --> 01:11:01,345
 <i>Noby's happiness confirmed.</i>
Mission Program accomplished.

879
01:11:01,365 --> 01:11:04,869
 <i>Return to the future in 48 hours.</i><i>

880
01:11:05,421 --> 01:11:08,957
Oh, yeah.
That's how Soby programmed it.

881
01:11:13,210 --> 01:11:15,813
I'm so glad.

882
01:11:15,905 --> 01:11:19,308
I'm relieved.

883
01:11:19,406 --> 01:11:22,909
Now I can finally go back.

884
01:11:24,784 --> 01:11:26,786
You really are...

885
01:11:27,814 --> 01:11:29,283
...klutzy and slow.

886
01:11:30,373 --> 01:11:32,942
You hate to study.

887
01:11:33,444 --> 01:11:36,714
You're timid and lazy.

888
01:11:37,414 --> 01:11:41,685
You're so bad at sports.

889
01:11:42,490 --> 01:11:46,894
Cowardly and forgetful.

890
01:11:46,937 --> 01:11:52,343
You're unreliable and you goof off.

891
01:11:54,542 --> 01:11:59,581
You're a wimp and a slow learner.

892
01:12:01,733 --> 01:12:06,737
A pushover and a luck pusher.

893
01:12:06,782 --> 01:12:10,287
A spoiled baby...

894
01:12:13,397 --> 01:12:15,499
Hey!

895
01:12:16,637 --> 01:12:21,209
Uh-oh... What's wrong with me?

896
01:12:34,527 --> 01:12:36,629
Doraemon!

897
01:12:39,695 --> 01:12:42,298
I need a gadget for
eating pasta through my nose.

898
01:12:42,319 --> 01:12:44,822
If I don't, Big G's gonna beat me up!

899
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:49,273
Don't make promises you can't keep!

900
01:12:49,329 --> 01:12:54,402
You always depend on me!
Do things on your own for once!

901
01:12:54,679 --> 01:12:57,347
Why are you so mad?
What's wrong?

902
01:12:57,714 --> 01:13:00,016
I'll tell you what's wrong!

903
01:13:00,544 --> 01:13:04,649
I can't help you anymore
when you're in trouble!

904
01:13:05,474 --> 01:13:07,376
What do you mean?

905
01:13:11,032 --> 01:13:14,336
What's gotten into you?

906
01:13:14,729 --> 01:13:19,634
I can't stay here anymore.

907
01:13:21,457 --> 01:13:23,859
Do something!

908
01:13:24,213 --> 01:13:26,016
I'm sorry, Noby.

909
01:13:26,388 --> 01:13:30,592
I have to go back tomorrow
or I'm in trouble.

910
01:13:31,905 --> 01:13:36,243
Noby, that's enough.

911
01:13:36,514 --> 01:13:38,516
Let him go.

912
01:13:38,860 --> 01:13:41,062
Come back and visit us.

913
01:13:41,158 --> 01:13:44,461
But this program...

914
01:13:44,499 --> 01:13:48,103
...won't let me
come back to this era.

915
01:13:48,673 --> 01:13:52,276
Is that right?
We'll miss you.

916
01:13:53,265 --> 01:13:57,102
- Take care.
- No! Don't go, Doraemon!

917
01:13:57,135 --> 01:14:01,540
I don't want to.
I'd stay if I could.

918
01:14:01,543 --> 01:14:05,346
 <i>Improper words detected</i><i>

919
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:07,082
Oops!

920
01:14:10,729 --> 01:14:13,732
I'll go back to the future!

921
01:14:13,821 --> 01:14:14,822
Doraemon!

922
01:14:15,207 --> 01:14:18,042
Are you okay?!
Doraemon?

923
01:14:19,751 --> 01:14:24,655
I can't defy the Mission Program.

924
01:14:33,721 --> 01:14:37,624
Noby, I don't know what to say.

925
01:14:42,428 --> 01:14:44,296
Don't be so sad.

926
01:14:49,577 --> 01:14:54,683
Your future changed.
Be happy.

927
01:14:54,763 --> 01:14:58,567
It's meaningless without you.

928
01:15:00,034 --> 01:15:04,840
You changed as well.
You're not the guy I first met.

929
01:15:11,561 --> 01:15:12,562
Still...

930
01:15:13,275 --> 01:15:16,378
I'm worried.

931
01:15:17,091 --> 01:15:21,929
I wish I could stay with you.

932
01:15:22,783 --> 01:15:25,887
Will you be okay without me?

933
01:15:27,326 --> 01:15:31,530
Will you be able
to stand up to Big G dan Sneech?

934
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:35,122
Noby!

935
01:15:41,732 --> 01:15:44,334
- Where are you going?
- Leave me alone.

936
01:15:44,348 --> 01:15:45,951
Noby!

937
01:15:54,408 --> 01:15:56,410
Doraemon, you idiot...

938
01:15:56,469 --> 01:15:59,672
You know I'm not okay on my own.

939
01:16:01,082 --> 01:16:04,085
Hey, Noby!

940
01:16:05,963 --> 01:16:08,667
I'm glad you're here.

941
01:16:11,327 --> 01:16:12,328
Big G...

942
01:16:13,865 --> 01:16:16,367
Have you decided?

943
01:16:16,909 --> 01:16:19,513
Eat pasta through your nose?

944
01:16:19,598 --> 01:16:22,401
Or get beat up by me?

945
01:16:25,126 --> 01:16:26,127
Help me, Dora?

946
01:16:26,642 --> 01:16:30,947
<i>Will you be able</i>
to stand up to Big G dan Sneech?

947
01:16:34,196 --> 01:16:36,532
- Hold on!
- Huh?

948
01:16:39,617 --> 01:16:41,419
<i>Can you do it alone?</i>

949
01:16:44,361 --> 01:16:46,062
If we're gonna fight...

950
01:16:48,287 --> 01:16:51,290
Let's leave Doraemon out of it.

951
01:16:52,689 --> 01:16:56,492
How brave of you.
Now you're talking.

952
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,983
Ready to start?

953
01:17:02,176 --> 01:17:03,978
It already started!

954
01:17:06,946 --> 01:17:10,449
I wonder where Noby is?

955
01:17:10,470 --> 01:17:12,773
It's our last night together.

956
01:17:16,841 --> 01:17:19,343
So you give up?

957
01:17:19,868 --> 01:17:22,371
Don't ever disrespect me again.

958
01:17:23,204 --> 01:17:25,406
Wait. I haven't lost yet.

959
01:17:26,277 --> 01:17:27,278
What?

960
01:17:27,706 --> 01:17:29,975
You haven't had enough?

961
01:17:30,750 --> 01:17:33,353
I'm just getting started!

962
01:17:40,141 --> 01:17:45,647
He's still not home.
What is he doing? Where is he?

963
01:17:45,676 --> 01:17:50,180
Making me worry even on my last night...

964
01:17:56,071 --> 01:17:58,874
Had enough now?

965
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:03,611
Not yet!

966
01:18:07,208 --> 01:18:09,710
Noby!

967
01:18:10,162 --> 01:18:12,699
Where is he?

968
01:18:21,325 --> 01:18:24,027
Noby!

969
01:18:26,517 --> 01:18:32,523
He's been gone too long.
Something must have happened.

970
01:18:34,855 --> 01:18:38,660
Let go of me!

971
01:18:39,159 --> 01:18:40,961
I've gotta beat you...

972
01:18:42,411 --> 01:18:44,446
...on my own...

973
01:18:50,026 --> 01:18:52,262
I have to show...

974
01:18:53,159 --> 01:18:56,963
...Doraemon that...

975
01:18:57,922 --> 01:19:00,359
...I'll be okay without him!

976
01:19:01,224 --> 01:19:03,025
Buzz off!

977
01:19:05,467 --> 01:19:07,369
You!

978
01:19:07,978 --> 01:19:09,580
Enough alerady!

979
01:19:53,632 --> 01:19:55,534
Okay, okay, you win.

980
01:19:57,243 --> 01:19:59,545
Forgive me, Noby!

981
01:20:05,135 --> 01:20:09,239
Noby!

982
01:20:19,837 --> 01:20:23,440
I won.

983
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:26,544
You saw, didn't you?

984
01:20:28,005 --> 01:20:29,607
I won.

985
01:20:32,690 --> 01:20:35,893
By myself.

986
01:20:37,094 --> 01:20:43,600
Now you won't
have to worry about me.

987
01:20:48,361 --> 01:20:50,931
Right, Doraemon?

988
01:21:22,641 --> 01:21:26,044
Noby! Finish your breakfast!

989
01:21:27,485 --> 01:21:28,486
Okay.

990
01:21:31,311 --> 01:21:32,812
 <i>Doraemon...</i><i>

991
01:21:32,854 --> 01:21:38,793
 <i>My room feels empty without you</i><i>

992
01:21:39,171 --> 01:21:40,973
I'm coming!

993
01:21:47,055 --> 01:21:51,359
 <i>But I'll get used to it soon</i><i>

994
01:21:51,359 --> 01:21:55,664
 <i>So don't worry about me, Doraemon.</i>

995
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:09,133
 <i>What?! Tsuchinoko?</i><i>

996
01:22:09,869 --> 01:22:13,172
I thought they were a myth!
That's amazing!

997
01:22:13,253 --> 01:22:16,157
Keep your voice down.

998
01:22:16,481 --> 01:22:19,784
I chased it in here
so poke it from that side.

999
01:22:19,861 --> 01:22:22,263
I'll catch it here.

1000
01:22:22,362 --> 01:22:23,363
Okay.

1001
01:22:34,526 --> 01:22:36,128
Ouch!

1002
01:22:36,488 --> 01:22:38,290
Serves you right!

1003
01:22:40,361 --> 01:22:44,865
Ouch... that was a mean prank.

1004
01:22:46,450 --> 01:22:50,553
Noby!
Thank goodness I found you!

1005
01:22:52,376 --> 01:22:56,013
Stay calm and listen.

1006
01:22:57,048 --> 01:23:02,352
Guess who I just saw?

1007
01:23:02,786 --> 01:23:05,689
Ready?

1008
01:23:06,168 --> 01:23:10,473
Do-ra-e-mon.

1009
01:23:12,292 --> 01:23:13,293
Doraemon?!

1010
01:23:14,162 --> 01:23:15,163
Hello?

1011
01:23:19,154 --> 01:23:20,655
Doraemon!!

1012
01:23:24,194 --> 01:23:25,795
Doraemon!?!!

1013
01:23:27,862 --> 01:23:29,665
Mom!?

1014
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:35,444
Are you okay?

1015
01:23:36,321 --> 01:23:38,356
I'm okay.

1016
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:39,702
Is Doraemon here?

1017
01:23:40,577 --> 01:23:43,379
What? Is he back?

1018
01:23:44,406 --> 01:23:47,376
He's not here?
That's weird.

1019
01:23:49,348 --> 01:23:51,751
Oh, I know!

1020
01:23:54,510 --> 01:23:59,014
He's being shy and hiding
with an invinsible Cape.

1021
01:23:59,044 --> 01:24:02,048
I can't wait to see him.

1022
01:24:04,005 --> 01:24:08,008
I think I'll go buy some yummy buns.

1023
01:24:08,992 --> 01:24:12,597
I hope Doraemon is here
when I come back.

1024
01:24:16,701 --> 01:24:21,105
Yummy buns, yummy buns.

1025
01:24:22,566 --> 01:24:25,970
My lie was better than yours.

1026
01:24:26,014 --> 01:24:29,517
Yes, you win.

1027
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:32,222
You were lying?!

1028
01:24:33,778 --> 01:24:36,080
Today's April Fools' Day!

1029
01:24:36,126 --> 01:24:39,329
You're easier to fool
than anyone I know.

1030
01:24:45,109 --> 01:24:48,312
- Lie and get us back then.
- Yeah.

1031
01:24:48,327 --> 01:24:50,729
There's a ghost behind you!

1032
01:24:51,788 --> 01:24:56,360
What is this Kindergarten?

1033
01:25:07,070 --> 01:25:09,072
Doraemon...

1034
01:25:13,533 --> 01:25:14,534
Oh, yeah!

1035
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:18,448
When I'm gone...

1036
01:25:18,521 --> 01:25:22,524
...and something really horrible happens...

1037
01:25:23,045 --> 01:25:24,546
Here it is.

1038
01:25:25,694 --> 01:25:27,997
 <i>Press the switch on the nose.</i><i>

1039
01:25:28,947 --> 01:25:34,853
 <i>You'll find whatever you need inside</i><i>

1040
01:25:39,185 --> 01:25:42,588
This potion is called Liar Liar Liquid.

1041
01:25:43,202 --> 01:25:47,405
Drink this and
everything you say will become a lie.

1042
01:25:48,369 --> 01:25:50,873
Perfect for April Fool's Day.

1043
01:25:50,884 --> 01:25:55,988
That lie about Doraemon was
the cruelest thing they could've said.

1044
01:25:57,509 --> 01:25:59,711
They're gonna regret it.

1045
01:26:01,345 --> 01:26:03,147
Oh no, a ghost!

1046
01:26:03,168 --> 01:26:05,370
Look, Big G!

1047
01:26:06,078 --> 01:26:08,080
He looks pumped up.

1048
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:10,963
Another stupid lie?

1049
01:26:10,987 --> 01:26:13,390
Give it to us.

1050
01:26:14,211 --> 01:26:15,212
Go ahead!

1051
01:26:17,566 --> 01:26:18,567
Will you apologize to me?

1052
01:26:23,975 --> 01:26:26,778
- Then fine.
- Listen to him.

1053
01:26:34,187 --> 01:26:36,189
Nice weather today.

1054
01:26:36,205 --> 01:26:38,607
That's it?

1055
01:26:42,438 --> 01:26:43,439
It's raining hard.

1056
01:26:44,071 --> 01:26:45,673
What did you do?!

1057
01:26:47,956 --> 01:26:49,457
What next?

1058
01:26:50,109 --> 01:26:51,810
He's spooking me out.

1059
01:26:51,846 --> 01:26:56,151
Let's see...

1060
01:26:56,683 --> 01:26:57,684
Sneech...

1061
01:27:01,018 --> 01:27:02,019
Won't be bitten by a dog!

1062
01:27:02,742 --> 01:27:03,743
Dog!

1063
01:27:05,242 --> 01:27:07,344
Dog! Help!

1064
01:27:09,199 --> 01:27:10,200
Big G.

1065
01:27:11,180 --> 01:27:14,884
Your mom is gonna be super nice to you.

1066
01:27:16,980 --> 01:27:18,981
There you are!!

1067
01:27:19,638 --> 01:27:22,240
You're supposed to be
helping out at the shop!

1068
01:27:22,957 --> 01:27:25,960
You're in big trouble.

1069
01:27:27,164 --> 01:27:29,466
Mom! I'm sorry!

1070
01:27:30,269 --> 01:27:31,270
Mom!!

1071
01:27:45,018 --> 01:27:47,553
- I'm home.
- Hi.

1072
01:27:54,924 --> 01:27:57,026
Did you find Doraemon?

1073
01:27:57,668 --> 01:27:59,471
Of course not.

1074
01:28:06,681 --> 01:28:10,285
Doraemon's not coming back.

1075
01:28:13,589 --> 01:28:15,991
I'm never seeing him again.

1076
01:28:32,233 --> 01:28:33,234
Noby!

1077
01:28:38,076 --> 01:28:39,978
Why? How?

1078
01:28:40,430 --> 01:28:44,435
It was so strange.
Suddenly I was allowed to come back.

1079
01:28:46,779 --> 01:28:49,181
I know why, you drank this...

1080
01:28:49,276 --> 01:28:52,279
...and said I wasn't coming back.

1081
01:29:03,290 --> 01:29:05,192
I'm not happy...

1082
01:29:05,954 --> 01:29:11,058
Not happy.
I'm not happy at all.

1083
01:29:13,371 --> 01:29:15,374
Not happy at all.

1084
01:29:17,548 --> 01:29:18,549
Really not happy.

1085
01:29:19,838 --> 01:29:22,941
Forever from now on...

1086
01:29:23,034 --> 01:29:28,541
Doraemon and I won't stay forever...

1087
01:29:29,122 --> 01:29:30,791
No we won't.

1088
01:29:31,312 --> 01:29:34,448
We will not stay together.

1089
01:29:51,663 --> 01:29:59,839
STAND BY ME DORAEMON
