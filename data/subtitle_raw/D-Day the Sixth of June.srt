1
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:34,843
- Heave up.
- Heave up.

2
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:42,654
- Anchors aweigh, sir.
- All engines ahead one third.

3
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:47,063
- Engines ahead one third.
- Anchor in sight.

4
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:50,697
Clear anchor, sir.

5
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,967
- Secure anchors for sea.
- Secure anchors for sea.

6
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:58,275
All engines ahead standard.

7
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,335
Engines ahead standard.

8
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,746
- Ready, Captain?
- Ready, Colonel.

9
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:17,291
Attention all officers of Special Force Six.

10
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:20,423
<i>Attention. All officers of Special Force Six,</i>

11
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,401
<i>proceed immediately
to the wardroom on A deck forward.</i>

12
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,869
<i>Officers only. Immediately, please.</i>

13
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:38,773
I was also told today that the Germans
have thickened up the mines on the beach.

14
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:43,788
Accordingly, a small party of sappers
was landed three hours ago by submarine,

15
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:47,189
to clear a path across the beach
at the base of the cliff.

16
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,660
They have since reembarked safely,

17
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:53,529
but your men will avoid unnecessary
spreading out across the beaches.

18
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,127
Now commit yourselves boldly and quickly.

19
00:03:57,203 --> 00:04:00,604
Hesitation won't save casualties,
it'll cost casualties.

20
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:03,574
We've some hard knocks to take,
but if we start boldly,

21
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:06,237
more of us will be alive when it's all over.

22
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:10,207
My only regret is that
I've not had time to get to know any of you,

23
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:12,376
during the few days that I've been with you.

24
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,613
But despite the unfortunate circumstance

25
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:17,349
that deprived you
of your original commander,

26
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:21,291
I feel you have given me
your confidence and cooperation. Thank you.

27
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:25,957
Now, I've always found it's a good idea
to put the operation completely out of mind

28
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:28,227
during the last few hours before zero.

29
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,292
So shall we do that, gentlemen?

30
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,361
That's all. Good luck.

31
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:43,278
If he fights as well as he talks,
those Krauts are in for a bad time.

32
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:45,408
He will. Don't let anybody say different.

33
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:49,751
Yeah. I guess if a guy's got it,
you can smell it a mile away. I'll see you.

34
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,619
- Sir?
- Oh, Brooks.

35
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:54,717
Yes, Captain. I was told
to report to you after the briefing.

36
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,126
Get all your platoon sergeants together.

37
00:04:57,196 --> 00:05:00,859
When we hit the beach, there'll be
no running outside the cleared line.

38
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:03,731
It'll be marked.
The rest of the beach is mined.

39
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,794
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, Tom?

40
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:07,863
- Sir?
- How you feelin'?

41
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,799
- Lousy.
- Me too.

42
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,978
- Parker?
- Sir.

43
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:27,220
- I thought it was you. Feeling a bit edgy?
- Afraid I am, sir.

44
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:29,853
- I take it this is your first show?
- Yes, sir.

45
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:33,421
It's the best, Captain Parker.
The first one is always the best.

46
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,764
You have all your luck riding with you.

47
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:41,671
- How many of these have you been on, sir?
- Off the sea? About half a dozen.

48
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,732
Some duds. Some fairly good.

49
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:51,940
It's odd, meeting like this.

50
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:54,743
- She told you?
- Oh, yes.

51
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:01,388
Treacherous old beast, the Channel.

52
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:09,165
At least the Germans'll
never expect us, not in this weather.

53
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:16,307
Try and get some sleep.
Even a minute or two makes a difference.

54
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:32,418
They'll have to beach us
higher than these breakers.

55
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,483
They'll need luck.

56
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,725
I'm not sending men waist-deep into this sea
with 60-pound mortars on their backs.

57
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,795
<i>Aren't you?</i>

58
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:49,501
<i>But if the boats don't carry up the beach,
you haven't any choice, have you?</i>

59
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:54,172
<i>Why don't you take your own advice
and stop thinking about it?</i>

60
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,841
<i>It used to be so easy for you, in the desert.</i>

61
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:00,342
<i>All you had to do was to think back.</i>

62
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:05,053
<i>Think back to that wonderful,
unspoiled time before Egypt,</i>

63
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:10,289
<i>when she didn't owe you anything because
you weren't a hero then, and wounded.</i>

64
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:13,662
<i>You wanted to ask her a question. It was 1942.</i>

65
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,897
<i>You had so little time.</i>

66
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:30,344
Bailey, why don't you pop to that pub?
I'll meet you there.

67
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:33,544
We oughtn't to stay long, sir,
if we're to rejoin that convoy.

68
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,712
All right. You get yourself a beer.

69
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,916
With lights, of course,
it'd be a different story.

70
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:52,994
Captain Wynter. Come in quickly, sir.

71
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:56,337
The Brigadier will be so pleased to see you.

72
00:07:56,409 --> 00:08:00,345
- Mala, is Miss Valerie about?
- Yes, Captain Wynter.

73
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:03,576
<i>- Yes, Mala. Who is it?
- It is Captain Wynter, sir.</i>

74
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:07,443
It's not polite, barging in on you, sir.

75
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,919
- But all the telephone lines...
- Sh.

76
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:14,652
<i>.. the arrival of
reinforcements, including American tanks,</i>

77
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:16,888
<i>is regarded in military circles in Cairo</i>

78
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:23,664
<i>as certain to turn the tide of battle strongly in
our favor within a matter of days, if not hours.</i>

79
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:26,136
<i>General Dittmar's weekly broadcast...</i>

80
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,196
- John!
- Hello, Valerie.

81
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,203
What on earth are you doing here?

82
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,306
Some would say a bad thing. I say a good.
In fact, I broke out of a convoy.

83
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:39,442
- Broke out of a convoy?
- Good for you.

84
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,455
- An embarkation privilege I allowed myself.
- Embarkation?

85
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,718
- Yes. I'm off, Val.
- How do you mean, off?

86
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,055
The division's
only been training two months.

87
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:52,120
I'm not with the division any more. It's
a reinforced company, a small Commando.

88
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,634
- I volunteered and they gave it to me.
- Did you have to volunteer?

89
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:59,728
There's no such thing as having to volunteer,
girl. Contradiction in terms.

90
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:02,205
It's just that I have a rather singular theory.

91
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:05,904
The quicker more of us go off,
the quicker more of us'll get back.

92
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:09,277
It's a rather illogical theory too, I suppose.

93
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:11,339
Don't be annoyed about it, please.

94
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:14,181
I suppose you can't
tell me where you're going?

95
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:18,349
- Some place haunted by the lizard, I imagine.
- Ah. Shepherd's Hotel, Cairo.

96
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:21,393
- Father.
- You're looking very fit, sir.

97
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,826
I am fit. Sit down, Wynter.

98
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:29,497
Two years. Two years since Dunkirk,
and they keep me on the sick list.

99
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,936
Well, when I do go back,
they'll have to give me a division.

100
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:36,998
Of course, I know why they're keeping
me here. They're afraid I'll fight.

101
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:41,706
When you do get your division, sir, I'd be
very proud if I could serve with you again.

102
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:44,682
And I'd want you, Wynter.
You've got the makings.

103
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,116
You had them at St. Omer in '40.

104
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:51,088
You know,
I've missed our talks this past winter.

105
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,216
Thank you, sir. Me too.

106
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:54,816
- Sir?
- What?

107
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:57,454
Would you mind if Valerie and I
took a walk to the pub?

108
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,521
Nonsense. You'll find nothing there.

109
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:04,901
- I'll fix you something to keep the cold out.
- Father, please. I would like to.

110
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,963
Oh, my dear fellow.
Please, please forgive me.

111
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,600
I got so used to your official visits, I...

112
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:12,667
That's all right, sir.

113
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:23,816
That German bomber again. He always tries
to make the runway at the bomber station.

114
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:26,323
He never does, though. Can't hit a thing.

115
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,656
There's a boy down the road
with an ak-ak gun.

116
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:31,094
British, and he can't hit a thing either.

117
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:35,395
And the grown-ups sit around in Whitehall
waiting for the Americans to come.

118
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,459
- More boys.
- Goodbye, sir.

119
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:40,732
Well, good luck, then, Wynter.

120
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:45,766
Get wherever you're going, but for goodness'
sake come to close quarters with the Hun.

121
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:49,576
A bit of cold steel now is worth
20 American bombers in a year's time.

122
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,209
- Right, sir.
- It sounds old-fashioned, but try it.

123
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:54,275
You'll find it'll work wonders.

124
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,558
- I'm afraid Father's terribly jealous.
- Of you?

125
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:05,188
No, silly, of you,
going to the war without him.

126
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:08,461
I'm afraid he'll die here
if they don't give him something to do.

127
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:11,230
Well, it can't be very easy
for you either, Val.

128
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:15,239
I've hardly been a mile
beyond the common in the last two years.

129
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:19,710
I feel rather like a yearling that's
very much grown up, but still tethered.

130
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,942
You're still in the ATS.
Can't you get ordered to London?

131
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:27,475
I am. I'm going next month. And ironically,
I'm working for the American Red Cross.

132
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:30,545
Oh. Won't your father mind?
The Americans, I mean.

133
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:34,115
No, he accepts the Red Cross,
because it's so universal.

134
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:42,131
- Val.
- Yes, John?

135
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,227
I wouldn't want anything I'd said
to make you feel tethered.

136
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:48,330
- But I did want to say that...
- Yes, John?

137
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:51,069
It isn't life and death
if you don't feel the same.

138
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:55,842
While I'm gone, in a terribly strong way,
I'm going to need you.

139
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:57,906
John, I...

140
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:01,248
Just to be able to think of you,
write to you, to know that you're here.

141
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,189
Because everything
that I'm leaving behind has become...

142
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,861
Well, you, suddenly.

143
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,055
- Bailey.
- Yes, sir.

144
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:16,124
- I'll be with you in a sec.
- Right, sir.

145
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:22,406
- Does it make any sense?
- Yes, John.

146
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,875
It makes all the sense in the world.

147
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,606
Please. You're notjust saying that?

148
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:32,583
Don't you understand that
I need you just as much as you need me?

149
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:37,511
Just as we started to know each other,
you're going away.

150
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,424
And I'd have felt so, sort of,
safe and useless and alone

151
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:44,691
without someone to be proud of,
and frightened for,

152
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:50,429
and to be waiting for when they come back,
and to live for when it's all over.

153
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:55,132
This is going to have to last me a long time.

154
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,973
I'm glad there's a moon for us.

155
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:09,053
There'll be more. Lots of them.

156
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:12,284
Whenever you see it,
the moon I mean, promise to imagine

157
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,588
I'm looking at it at the exact same moment.

158
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,026
In Egypt, the desert, anywhere.

159
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:19,223
- It'll be the same moon.
- I promise.

160
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:27,700
- All clear?
- All clear.

161
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:57,096
Assault craft will be lowered away
at 0420, Colonel Wynter.

162
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:04,465
- Thanks.
- Good luck, Colonel.

163
00:14:20,692 --> 00:14:23,160
Oh, Chief? How we doin'?

164
00:14:23,228 --> 00:14:25,822
Pretty steady, sir. 10, 11 knots, I'd say.

165
00:14:26,898 --> 00:14:28,889
Be a couple more hours.

166
00:14:30,068 --> 00:14:33,435
- You in a hurry, sir?
- Sure. A hurry to get it over with.

167
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:36,764
Can't blame you at that.

168
00:14:37,842 --> 00:14:41,778
- Been over here long, Captain?
- Two years, three months.

169
00:14:41,846 --> 00:14:43,837
- Tough.
- Yeah.

170
00:14:48,386 --> 00:14:50,854
<i>But it wasn't so tough. Not at first.</i>

171
00:14:50,922 --> 00:14:53,447
<i>Not when you got to London.</i>

172
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:57,985
<i>You didn't know anything about Valerie then,
or the sixth of June,</i>

173
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:02,432
<i>or this feeling of being expendable
for the first time in your life.</i>

174
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:07,938
<i>You had a well-pressed uniform, a staff job
in London, a pretty wife back home,</i>

175
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,104
<i>You really had it made.</i>

176
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,167
<i>Or did you?</i>

177
00:15:33,531 --> 00:15:35,761
<i>Stop trying to find the war, Parker.</i>

178
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,995
- Means nothing, huh?
- Not in daytime.

179
00:15:41,072 --> 00:15:43,063
Probably just a Messerschmitt 110,

180
00:15:43,141 --> 00:15:45,803
heard a new Captain hit town
and came for a snapshot.

181
00:15:45,877 --> 00:15:49,608
- He'll be 50 miles away by now.
- How's the razor blade situation over here?

182
00:15:49,681 --> 00:15:54,345
Get all you want at the PX.
Blades, soap, and I can get you some Scotch.

183
00:15:54,419 --> 00:15:56,887
Hey, pretty fancy.

184
00:15:56,955 --> 00:16:01,722
- "Brad and Janie." Wives are devious.
- Oh, I don't know. I kind of like mine.

185
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:05,593
- Did you promise never to take it off?
- That's right.

186
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:08,258
I can't say that I blame you. She's a beaut.

187
00:16:09,334 --> 00:16:12,997
I heard the Colonel say that
you publish a newspaper in Connecticut.

188
00:16:13,071 --> 00:16:15,801
- My father-in-law is a publisher.
- Same difference.

189
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:18,035
It'll still make the old man happy.

190
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,840
That's the all clear.

191
00:16:22,914 --> 00:16:26,907
We're late. When you've got an appointment
with Colonel Alexander Timmer,

192
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:29,453
publisher or no publisher, you keep it.

193
00:16:30,655 --> 00:16:35,422
Here it is, Parker. Headquarters, European
Theater of Operations, United States Army.

194
00:16:35,493 --> 00:16:37,484
Your new home.

195
00:16:37,562 --> 00:16:41,089
Watch it, now. You're gonna be
married to this guy for a long, long time.

196
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,327
- How does he like his eggs?
- Hard-boiled.

197
00:16:43,401 --> 00:16:46,962
Behind that door, you'll find
an ex-car salesman from Minneapolis.

198
00:16:47,038 --> 00:16:49,734
who's conducting
a very vigorous war to make General.

199
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:52,675
And thank your lucky stars
you weren't at West Point.

200
00:16:52,744 --> 00:16:54,735
- What's wrong with West Point?
- Nothing.

201
00:16:54,813 --> 00:17:00,274
Except that Lieutenant Colonel Alexander
Timmer didn't happen to go there. Good luck.

202
00:17:02,754 --> 00:17:04,745
Yeah.

203
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:08,284
Captain Parker, sir.
I was ordered to report to you.

204
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,352
All right, Parker. Relax.
That's the way it's gonna be, Ed.

205
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:13,829
Remember,
possession is nine points of the law.

206
00:17:13,898 --> 00:17:16,696
The General will be
the bestjudge of that, Timmer.

207
00:17:16,768 --> 00:17:20,067
Cry on the General's shoulder
if you want. It's got stars on it.

208
00:17:20,138 --> 00:17:23,005
And he's a West Point man.
Maybe he'll see it your way.

209
00:17:23,074 --> 00:17:25,975
- But those new officers are in my section.
- Your section?

210
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:28,535
Very well, Timmer. We'll see what happens.

211
00:17:28,613 --> 00:17:31,673
Talking of new officers,
Captain Parker, Colonel Cantrell.

212
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,741
- How do you do, sir?
- How do you do?

213
00:17:33,818 --> 00:17:35,809
- See you, Timmer.
- Right.

214
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,748
Mr. West Point Honor Cadet.

215
00:17:41,626 --> 00:17:45,062
Parker, there's just one thing
I ask of the men under me.

216
00:17:45,363 --> 00:17:48,298
- Can you keep your mouth shut?
- I was briefed on security.

217
00:17:48,366 --> 00:17:50,357
- Where?
- Fort Harrison, sir.

218
00:17:50,435 --> 00:17:53,199
Kid stuff.
Now you gotta live and breathe security.

219
00:17:53,371 --> 00:17:54,895
- You want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

220
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:58,101
You know why I picked you, mostly?
Those parachute wings.

221
00:17:58,176 --> 00:18:01,703
- I was invalided out of the airborne.
- Yeah, I know all about you, Parker.

222
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,578
I ran a full-scale
security check on you myself.

223
00:18:04,649 --> 00:18:06,708
So, you broke your leg jumping.

224
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:09,913
Well, for my dough
you're still a fighting man. So am I.

225
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:13,583
Some of this brass here doesn't
quite realize that, but they will.

226
00:18:13,658 --> 00:18:18,027
So will Ed Cantrell. He thinks he'll get
those chickens on his shoulders before I do.

227
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:21,395
Well, he's wrong. He's so wrong, Parker.
Where are you billeted?

228
00:18:21,466 --> 00:18:26,233
- Captain Boyce. I'm sharing his apartment.
- Ray Boyce? He's smart. Maybe too smart.

229
00:18:26,304 --> 00:18:29,933
Billeting with Boyce doesn't mean
he's gotta know everything you do.

230
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:31,999
- Understood?
- Understood, sir.

231
00:18:32,076 --> 00:18:34,738
- And don't be a knuckle man. Speak up.
- Yes, sir.

232
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:39,113
Now, here are some target tracings we're
proposing for Operation Sledgehammer.

233
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:41,175
Familiarize yourself with them.

234
00:18:41,252 --> 00:18:45,416
Then you'll run them to 632nd Bombardment
at Barkstow, Lincolnshire. Major Mills.

235
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:48,926
We'll see if the fellows at operational level
have different ideas.

236
00:18:48,993 --> 00:18:51,393
- Thank you, sir.
- Right.

237
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:55,594
Hey. Easy on that, Parker, now. Easy.

238
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:06,434
- Here we are, fellas, back in the graveyard.
- They oughta give the town back to the Saxs.

239
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:10,504
They were smart. They hightailed it
outta here a thousand years ago already.

240
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:12,573
- Wow!
- Oh, come on.

241
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:16,017
Don't rush me. Come on, give me
a break, will ya? Don't rush me.

242
00:19:16,087 --> 00:19:20,080
- Look, Bill. Soldiers!
- I say.

243
00:19:20,158 --> 00:19:24,060
- Hey, fellas, look. The Home Guard.
- Left, right. Left, right.

244
00:19:24,128 --> 00:19:26,221
Oh, here comes the infantry.

245
00:19:26,297 --> 00:19:30,233
<i>- Look at 'em drill.
- Left, right. Left, right. Left, right.</i>

246
00:19:30,301 --> 00:19:33,702
- Taxi.
- Left, right. Left, right. Left, right.

247
00:19:33,771 --> 00:19:38,435
Left, right. Left, right.
Left, right. Left, right. Left, right.

248
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,808
Left, right. Left, right. Left, right.

249
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:44,713
You know, my grandmother
could lick 'em all and she's two years dead.

250
00:19:44,782 --> 00:19:47,307
<i>Platoon halt!</i>

251
00:19:47,385 --> 00:19:49,785
Order arms.

252
00:19:49,854 --> 00:19:53,381
- You guys really expect to win the war?
- Hey, move over.

253
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,551
Eyes front.

254
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:58,027
- Look at the little one.
- Like a Boy Scout.

255
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:00,462
- What is that?
- Look alive, chaps.

256
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,501
This is rifle drill, not cricket practice.

257
00:20:03,568 --> 00:20:06,469
<i>I say, chaps. It ain't cricket, you know.</i>

258
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,974
Cricket? It ain't even marbles.
Come on, get that lead out, dad.

259
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:14,603
- Get that lead out!
- Don't look now, but we've got an audience.

260
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:18,171
You men will give me
your names, ranks and numbers.

261
00:20:18,249 --> 00:20:20,240
- You.
- Oh, get lost.

262
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:25,483
You fellas down at Plans sure have it easy.

263
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,924
An office and a mimeograph machine
and bingo, you're operational.

264
00:20:28,993 --> 00:20:31,962
Asking us to suggest targets
for Operation Sledgehammer!

265
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,056
On the target date they've got here,
we couldn't hit a tin can.

266
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:38,864
I was just ordered to get some tracings,
and with your help, I will do that.

267
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:41,303
<i>We'll have 'em in the morning.</i>

268
00:20:41,372 --> 00:20:43,363
Major Mills here.

269
00:20:43,441 --> 00:20:45,807
Yeah. Well, why bother me with it?

270
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:49,369
Do I have to handle
the provost marshal's work too?

271
00:20:49,447 --> 00:20:51,711
What?

272
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:54,377
Oh, no. A brigadier?

273
00:20:54,452 --> 00:20:56,443
A wounded brigadier?

274
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:58,512
I'll be right in.

275
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:02,683
- You come with me, Parker.
- Me?

276
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:07,163
Yes, you. It's time you guys in London
found out what we go through here.

277
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:16,706
<i>- You like three-day passes?
- Yes, sir.</i>

278
00:21:16,774 --> 00:21:20,232
Remember 'em. You won't see any more.
What's your version, Gerbett?

279
00:21:20,311 --> 00:21:23,747
- You often hit old men?
- I didn't see him till after I had hit him, sir.

280
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:26,477
I don't care if I get busted
back to private for this.

281
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:29,179
I don't have to take a whippin'
from any of them, sir.

282
00:21:29,253 --> 00:21:31,847
So you ride men
who are doing their best to win the war?

283
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:36,019
No more than they ride us. They've given us
the silent treatment since we got here.

284
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:40,121
They act like they're doing us a favor, lettin'
us come here. If we're not good enough,

285
00:21:40,231 --> 00:21:43,098
- why can't they fight their own war?
- That's enough.

286
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:46,694
- Take them back to base, Captain.
- Yes, sir. Anderson, take over.

287
00:21:46,771 --> 00:21:48,762
Sir. Into the truck.

288
00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:53,673
Hate to see morale go to pot,
but what can I do?

289
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:55,736
- Aircrew?
- Sure, aircrew.

290
00:21:55,813 --> 00:21:59,340
Soon they'll be flying
combat missions over Germany in daylight.

291
00:21:59,417 --> 00:22:01,647
We'd better get to see the brigadier.

292
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:10,023
I will inform the brigadier,
but I'm not sure he wishes to see anyone.

293
00:22:12,096 --> 00:22:15,554
Brace yourself, Captain.
She's only the servant.

294
00:22:15,633 --> 00:22:17,624
You'd think we weren't alive.

295
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,901
Gentlemen?

296
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:30,641
Major Mills,
group adjutant at the bomber station.

297
00:22:30,715 --> 00:22:33,445
This is Captain Parker
of ETO Headquarters.

298
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,509
Yes?

299
00:22:35,586 --> 00:22:41,047
Brigadier, I'd like to offer my regrets for
the behavior of one of our men this morning.

300
00:22:43,461 --> 00:22:45,759
We'll have the man up on charges, of course,

301
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:49,493
and I think I can assure you
he'll be adequately dealt with.

302
00:22:51,235 --> 00:22:53,829
If there are any ill-effects from the blow,

303
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:58,535
we will be glad to entertain any claim
for the discomfort you've suffered.

304
00:23:00,144 --> 00:23:03,272
- Do you hear me, sir?
- I hear you perfectly, Major Mills.

305
00:23:03,347 --> 00:23:07,374
But you haven't told me why your men
are permitted to loaf about the village,

306
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:09,613
shouting and using vile language.

307
00:23:09,887 --> 00:23:12,651
The village is not off-limits
to our men, sir. As to...

308
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,591
Then I suggest
you consider putting it off-limits.

309
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,651
That's a pretty drastic thing to do.

310
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:22,189
I can think of rather harsher orders I have
issued without the slightest difficulty.

311
00:23:22,266 --> 00:23:24,257
I don't blame you for feeling bitter.

312
00:23:24,335 --> 00:23:27,133
The fact that you were struck
by one of our enlisted men...

313
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:31,904
- It was I who struck him, Major Mills.
- Surely, sir, you gave him some warning?

314
00:23:31,976 --> 00:23:36,174
I am not in the habit of parleying
with rabble disguised in uniform.

315
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:42,744
That member of the "rabble" is an American
airman, who's over here to fight a war.

316
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,687
The war has been on
for some considerable time now.

317
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,748
I suggest he begin fighting it.

318
00:23:47,825 --> 00:23:50,692
He'll fight it all right.
And probably die all right.

319
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:55,859
Until then, he might usefully occupy his time
learning to conduct himself like a soldier.

320
00:23:55,933 --> 00:23:59,460
He'll conduct himself like a soldier
in the gun turret of his B-17,

321
00:23:59,537 --> 00:24:02,301
- flying over Germany in daylight.
- All right, Parker.

322
00:24:02,373 --> 00:24:06,139
You're entitled to slop over
your men if you like. I don't.

323
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:09,509
And may I now offer you
a glass of sherry, Major?

324
00:24:11,749 --> 00:24:13,842
No thank you, sir. Not right now.

325
00:24:13,918 --> 00:24:16,546
In that case, gentlemen, good afternoon.

326
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:19,685
I am sorry. We came with the best intentions.

327
00:24:19,757 --> 00:24:22,282
But darn it,
we've got to run our business our way.

328
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,760
Will you please leave, gentlemen?

329
00:24:36,473 --> 00:24:39,203
- Thanks, Parker. When I get mad I dry up.
- Not me.

330
00:24:39,276 --> 00:24:41,403
Who do these characters think they are?

331
00:24:41,478 --> 00:24:43,878
They were licked in '40
and they're taking a walloping.

332
00:24:43,947 --> 00:24:46,040
They won't admit they're dead pigeons.

333
00:24:46,116 --> 00:24:49,882
They need us inferior Americans, who've no
manners but a lot of power and know-how,

334
00:24:49,953 --> 00:24:51,944
- It's killing 'em.
- Hold it.

335
00:24:52,022 --> 00:24:54,422
Let her hear. What's the difference?

336
00:24:54,491 --> 00:24:57,289
My name is Valerie Russell.
You've just seen my father.

337
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,524
- It's just one of those things, Miss Russell...
- Will those men be punished?

338
00:25:01,598 --> 00:25:04,226
- Do you think they should be?
- No, absolutely not.

339
00:25:04,301 --> 00:25:07,600
If your father complains
to the War Office, we'll get a rocket.

340
00:25:07,671 --> 00:25:10,265
Well, he was wrong to do what he did.

341
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:14,106
I shan't be here after tomorrow, Major,
but I do want to say this.

342
00:25:14,177 --> 00:25:18,637
My father isn't well, and changes
frighten him. Americans mean changes.

343
00:25:18,715 --> 00:25:22,151
- He was wrong, but please try to understand.
- Believe me, I...

344
00:25:22,219 --> 00:25:25,211
Please. You see,
when he was wounded at Dunkirk,

345
00:25:25,288 --> 00:25:28,519
he felt that the England
he had loved had gone forever.

346
00:25:28,592 --> 00:25:32,551
Of course it hadn't,
but he's quite afraid now of lots of things.

347
00:25:33,563 --> 00:25:36,930
He's been through two wars
and quite badly, really,

348
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,560
with all the stupidity and waste of the first

349
00:25:39,636 --> 00:25:42,332
and the angry pride and despair of this one.

350
00:25:43,406 --> 00:25:47,137
But I do love my father,
and I just don't know Americans.

351
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:49,405
But you are here and fighting the war,

352
00:25:49,479 --> 00:25:53,609
and most of us want to try
and help you and make you feel welcome,

353
00:25:53,683 --> 00:25:58,382
But it's difficult, because some of us,
and the older ones particularly,

354
00:25:58,455 --> 00:26:02,789
are proud of what we've done, perhaps for
that reason prouder than we've a right to be,

355
00:26:02,859 --> 00:26:05,919
and therefore prouder than we've ever been.

356
00:26:05,996 --> 00:26:10,194
But please don't punish those men, Major,
and try to understand us.

357
00:26:12,269 --> 00:26:14,931
We're not awfully good at being thankful.

358
00:26:15,005 --> 00:26:18,634
We haven't had occasion to be thankful
to anyone, except possibly God,

359
00:26:18,708 --> 00:26:20,699
for several hundreds of years.

360
00:26:20,777 --> 00:26:23,507
But we'll try. You'll see.

361
00:26:30,153 --> 00:26:32,144
Well, shut my mouth.

362
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,953
- Parker.
- Hm? Oh.

363
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:05,113
- Excuse me.
- Good morning, Miss Russell.

364
00:27:06,122 --> 00:27:10,286
- In thatjeep, yesterday?
- Oh, yes. How nice of you to remember me.

365
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,453
- In the army, huh?
- Yes, in the army.

366
00:27:12,529 --> 00:27:14,963
I'm with your people,
the American Red Cross.

367
00:27:15,031 --> 00:27:17,261
Lucky Red Cross.
ETOUSA's where I work.

368
00:27:17,334 --> 00:27:21,202
- European Theater of Operations, U.S. Army.
- Sounds like a nice big place.

369
00:27:21,271 --> 00:27:23,671
- There are no seats back there.
- Oh, dear.

370
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:27,801
Well, there are none back there either, so...
Luckily, I've brought my own.

371
00:27:30,013 --> 00:27:33,312
- Ah, mind if I share that with you, love?
- Well... Oh.

372
00:27:34,684 --> 00:27:38,552
- Well, actually it's reserved for the Captain.
- Oh.

373
00:27:38,621 --> 00:27:41,556
Americans. Top priority, I suppose.

374
00:27:42,592 --> 00:27:45,561
Always get the best of everything.

375
00:27:45,628 --> 00:27:47,619
Thank you.

376
00:27:48,932 --> 00:27:53,198
Major Mills and I appreciated what you said.
It was like a breath of fresh air.

377
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:57,763
You must have been dying for fresh air.
All I said was that I don't know Americans.

378
00:27:57,841 --> 00:28:00,833
From a Britisher, that's close
to a compliment these days.

379
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:03,538
- Oh, we're terrible, aren't we?
- Sort of.

380
00:28:03,613 --> 00:28:06,844
But you people do love to be liked,
don't you, all of you?

381
00:28:06,916 --> 00:28:10,443
- All of us? Let's not get too impersonal.
- Tell the truth.

382
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,080
If you're asking me if I'd like you to like me...

383
00:28:13,156 --> 00:28:16,819
You know jolly well that wasn't what
I was asking. I couldn't care less.

384
00:28:16,893 --> 00:28:19,293
- I guess that puts me in my place.
- I'm sorry.

385
00:28:19,362 --> 00:28:22,820
- We have the foulest manners in the world.
- Let's say "effective."

386
00:28:22,899 --> 00:28:26,062
They're designed to make
strangers feel stranger. They work.

387
00:28:26,136 --> 00:28:27,967
- Cigarette?
- Mm. Thank you.

388
00:28:28,038 --> 00:28:30,836
Are those American cigarettes, sir?
Mind if I try one?

389
00:28:30,907 --> 00:28:32,966
- Go right ahead.
- Do you mind if I do?

390
00:28:33,043 --> 00:28:36,171
- Oh, thank you so much.
- Cigarettes, girls. Look.

391
00:28:38,982 --> 00:28:41,815
- Thank you so much, sir.
- Oh, I say. It's empty.

392
00:28:41,885 --> 00:28:44,945
- You're so generous.
- Two more whole packs here.

393
00:28:45,588 --> 00:28:47,715
- The "Arsenal of Democracy."
- What?

394
00:28:48,958 --> 00:28:52,257
Tell me the truth.
Under these cold, bad manners of ours,

395
00:28:52,328 --> 00:28:55,525
you love to think we're simply
green with envy for you, don't you?

396
00:28:55,598 --> 00:28:59,364
While you may envy us,
you don't respect us, That's pretty ugly.

397
00:28:59,436 --> 00:29:02,735
- That is ugly, Captain Parker. You're right.
- Brad.

398
00:29:02,806 --> 00:29:06,264
- Huh?
- I said Brad. It's my name. Call me Brad.

399
00:29:06,342 --> 00:29:08,333
Oh. Brad.

400
00:29:08,778 --> 00:29:11,804
All right. My name's Valerie.
But please don't call me Val.

401
00:29:11,881 --> 00:29:14,281
- You don't like it?
- Not particularly. But...

402
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:17,183
- Somebody else calls me it...
- And you don't like him?

403
00:29:17,253 --> 00:29:19,483
Yes, I like him very much.

404
00:29:19,556 --> 00:29:21,547
- In London?
- No, Africa.

405
00:29:22,592 --> 00:29:24,753
- Lonely war.
- I hate it.

406
00:29:25,895 --> 00:29:28,261
Well, I have a love, too. My wife Janie.

407
00:29:28,331 --> 00:29:30,765
- Lucky. What's she like?
- Beautiful.

408
00:29:30,834 --> 00:29:32,927
- Children?
- No, no children yet.

409
00:29:34,404 --> 00:29:38,568
- You probably have friends in London?
- I used to, before the war.

410
00:29:38,641 --> 00:29:41,439
Well, if not, perhaps
you'd share an occasional meal

411
00:29:41,511 --> 00:29:43,706
with a man who seems
due to be pretty lonely.

412
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,510
- You're very kind.
- Which is British for "no"?

413
00:29:46,583 --> 00:29:48,744
Which is British for "I'd love to."

414
00:29:49,686 --> 00:29:54,020
You turn left on Shaftesbury Avenue, and
it's facing you on Great Windmill Street.

415
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:56,354
It's supposed to be a pretty good show, huh?

416
00:29:56,426 --> 00:30:00,556
Yes, I believe it is, of it's kind, very.
I hope you enjoy the show.

417
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:03,622
Know somethin'? I was over there
watchin' you a while back,

418
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,760
and I said to myself,
"She don't look like an English girl."

419
00:30:06,836 --> 00:30:09,999
As a matter of fact, you remind me
a lot of a girl I knew back home.

420
00:30:10,073 --> 00:30:14,271
A real peach of a girl.
Boy, did we make beautiful music together!

421
00:30:14,344 --> 00:30:18,337
Really? You'd better run along,
Lieutenant, or you'll miss the show.

422
00:30:18,414 --> 00:30:20,405
- Brad!
- Good evening.

423
00:30:20,483 --> 00:30:23,509
- Good evening.
- You know, I suddenly realized,

424
00:30:23,586 --> 00:30:26,555
going out with me may be
kind of a postman's holiday for you.

425
00:30:26,623 --> 00:30:29,421
But I've been
looking forward to it so much, I promise.

426
00:30:29,492 --> 00:30:31,585
May I ask one professional question?

427
00:30:31,661 --> 00:30:34,824
Where's a good place
to take an English girl out to dinner?

428
00:30:34,898 --> 00:30:39,562
- Well, there's a little Italian place on...
- How about a big Italian?

429
00:30:39,636 --> 00:30:41,695
- On the expensive side?
- Preferably.

430
00:30:41,771 --> 00:30:44,604
Wailing violins, false Chianti
and black-market steak?

431
00:30:44,674 --> 00:30:47,802
- Sounds too good to be true.
- I know just the place.

432
00:30:53,183 --> 00:30:56,584
Well, now that you've been with us
for a week, how do you like us?

433
00:30:56,653 --> 00:31:00,350
So far, I've specialized in
very young officers who are very homesick.

434
00:31:00,423 --> 00:31:03,483
- The others make passes, huh?
- Oh, yes.

435
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,324
One man came to my desk
wearing a wedding ring.

436
00:31:06,396 --> 00:31:09,593
He went to the other side of the room,
came back minus the ring,

437
00:31:09,666 --> 00:31:11,759
and invited me to the theater.

438
00:31:11,834 --> 00:31:15,565
- I think you'd better go back to Barkstow.
- Oh, nonsense.

439
00:31:15,638 --> 00:31:20,701
Some of them aren't such fools. They can
catch you off balance. Air Force, especially.

440
00:31:20,777 --> 00:31:24,235
You know, you think of war
and of ordinary life standing still.

441
00:31:24,314 --> 00:31:27,078
- But it doesn't. It moves faster.
- I know.

442
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:30,483
- How are your brakes?
- Foolproof. How are yours?

443
00:31:30,553 --> 00:31:32,748
Tough as that steak we had for dinner.

444
00:31:32,822 --> 00:31:37,020
Then I'm going to tell you a secret.
That steak we had was horse meat.

445
00:31:38,795 --> 00:31:40,786
<i>Oh.</i>

446
00:31:44,167 --> 00:31:46,328
Very nice, thank you.

447
00:31:46,402 --> 00:31:51,339
Thank you, sir. It's always a pleasure
to play for two beautiful people in love.

448
00:31:54,444 --> 00:31:56,435
You know, it's a terrible...

449
00:32:01,784 --> 00:32:05,242
- Do you mind?
- Thank you. I understand.

450
00:32:05,321 --> 00:32:07,312
I understand.

451
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,151
I'm so glad about this evening.

452
00:32:14,163 --> 00:32:17,291
Because, whatever happens
in England, or at the club,

453
00:32:17,367 --> 00:32:20,063
I'll always be able to imagine America,

454
00:32:20,136 --> 00:32:23,071
because I've met you
and talked to you and liked you.

455
00:32:23,139 --> 00:32:26,108
I was thinking the same thing about England.

456
00:32:26,175 --> 00:32:30,305
All of a sudden, a whole country becomes
the voice and face of a single person.

457
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:33,008
A very wonderful person, too.

458
00:32:33,082 --> 00:32:35,516
That's terribly nice.

459
00:32:35,585 --> 00:32:37,985
- Would you like to dance?
- I'd love to.

460
00:33:22,031 --> 00:33:25,523
- What's the matter? No good?
- No, you dance very well.

461
00:33:25,601 --> 00:33:27,592
So do you, honey.

462
00:33:28,338 --> 00:33:30,067
- Brad?
- Hm?

463
00:33:30,139 --> 00:33:34,075
Don't be cross, but would you mind
awfully not calling me "honey"?

464
00:33:34,143 --> 00:33:36,134
Sorry.

465
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:39,079
How about Friday night?

466
00:33:39,148 --> 00:33:43,346
- Well, if you'd really like to, I'd love to.
- I'd really like to.

467
00:33:43,419 --> 00:33:46,286
Till Friday. And I'm so grateful for tonight.

468
00:33:46,356 --> 00:33:48,654
- I'm grateful, too.
- Goodbye.

469
00:34:05,775 --> 00:34:09,541
OK. Suppose you stay this way? Friends?

470
00:34:09,612 --> 00:34:13,343
Do you imagine your wife thinks
you'll be faithful the whole of the war?

471
00:34:13,416 --> 00:34:16,385
I don't know if she thinks it.
She's got a right to expect it.

472
00:34:16,452 --> 00:34:20,889
There's a rule about soldiers' comforts.
They should be physical, not emotional.

473
00:34:20,957 --> 00:34:23,448
Yeah, I've thought about all that.

474
00:34:23,526 --> 00:34:28,054
I'll even admit, when I first saw Valerie
I thought about it. Physically.

475
00:34:28,131 --> 00:34:31,532
She and I were a thousand miles
apart then, and strangers.

476
00:34:31,601 --> 00:34:34,968
Let me tell you, there's such
a thing as being too darn pure.

477
00:34:35,037 --> 00:34:40,031
It boomerangs. You think I'm cheap,
running around with dames in London.

478
00:34:40,109 --> 00:34:43,875
But when I go home, I'll guarantee you
this much. I'll go home to my wife.

479
00:34:43,946 --> 00:34:45,937
The lucky little woman.

480
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:49,247
- Well, I done the dishes.
- Good girl.

481
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:54,420
- Finished your little talk, have you?
- I guess so, thanks.

482
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:56,924
Ray, I think I'll hit the sack.
Good night, Jean.

483
00:34:56,993 --> 00:34:58,984
Good night. Sleep tight.

484
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,977
Hey, there's a big old gal.
I wonder where she's off to.

485
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:24,281
Oh, India, Africa, America... You never know.

486
00:35:29,091 --> 00:35:31,559
The saddest and
most exciting sound in the world.

487
00:35:31,627 --> 00:35:34,926
Do you know that
you actually looked sad just then?

488
00:35:34,997 --> 00:35:38,262
- I did? That's funny.
- Why? What were you thinking?

489
00:35:38,334 --> 00:35:40,325
About your wife?

490
00:35:41,337 --> 00:35:44,306
You like me to talk about Janie, don't you?

491
00:35:44,373 --> 00:35:47,001
- Why?
- Oh, Brad. Do we have to?

492
00:35:47,076 --> 00:35:50,011
- No, we don't have to.
- All right, then.

493
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,741
It's because it makes me feel safe.

494
00:35:52,815 --> 00:35:54,976
- Oh, thanks.
- Oh, I didn't mean it that way.

495
00:35:55,051 --> 00:35:57,042
- No. OK. I get it.
- Oh, Brad, darling.

496
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,656
<i>Final result! Final results!</i>

497
00:36:00,657 --> 00:36:03,888
- Results of what?
- Depends what you're after, mate.

498
00:36:06,562 --> 00:36:09,725
Thank you, lady. Final results! Final results!

499
00:36:14,337 --> 00:36:17,204
"Commandoes In Action in Desert?"

500
00:36:18,975 --> 00:36:23,071
Oh, that's just one of General Dittmar's
radio commercials out of Berlin.

501
00:36:23,146 --> 00:36:25,580
It says "The 71st Commando Unit..."

502
00:36:25,648 --> 00:36:27,639
John's?

503
00:36:28,184 --> 00:36:31,278
"Demolition raid on Tobruk Harbor."

504
00:36:31,354 --> 00:36:36,690
"Communiqué from Berlin says that the
bodies of 27 men, including eight officers..."

505
00:36:36,759 --> 00:36:38,989
Look, he might not even
have been on the raid.

506
00:36:39,062 --> 00:36:42,793
Even if he was, the odds are
still way against his being hurt.

507
00:36:43,866 --> 00:36:47,063
I'm a coward, Brad,
and I hate John for being so brave.

508
00:36:47,136 --> 00:36:49,127
He's going to make himself die.

509
00:36:50,707 --> 00:36:54,837
And right now, he's in the desert writing
silly, foolish, lighthearted letters

510
00:36:54,911 --> 00:36:58,472
about "getting ready
to singe old Rommel's beard."

511
00:36:58,548 --> 00:37:00,641
And now this.

512
00:37:02,318 --> 00:37:06,550
Look, why don't we go back
to the West End and have dinner, huh?

513
00:37:06,622 --> 00:37:10,752
All right. Butjust let's sit here
quietly for a moment, may we?

514
00:37:10,827 --> 00:37:12,818
Sure.

515
00:37:14,397 --> 00:37:16,388
- Hey, the moon's up.
- Where?

516
00:37:16,466 --> 00:37:18,696
There.

517
00:37:18,768 --> 00:37:21,259
Oh, please, God, let him be looking at it.

518
00:37:21,337 --> 00:37:23,328
He'll be back.

519
00:37:23,406 --> 00:37:27,274
You can bet on it. In a couple of years
the war'll be over and he'll be back.

520
00:37:27,343 --> 00:37:29,402
Long before, probably.

521
00:37:29,479 --> 00:37:32,471
A couple of years?
Oh, it seems like such ages.

522
00:37:33,883 --> 00:37:36,113
The summer of 1944.

523
00:37:41,257 --> 00:37:43,919
Brad, this hasn't anything
to do with the warning,

524
00:37:43,993 --> 00:37:46,791
but would you mind if I just went home?

525
00:37:46,863 --> 00:37:50,492
- Sure, but you'll need some dinner.
- No, I'm not very hungry.

526
00:37:55,271 --> 00:37:58,172
Suddenly everything's rather frightening.

527
00:38:16,292 --> 00:38:19,056
All right?

528
00:38:19,128 --> 00:38:21,392
Nice. OK if I come in?

529
00:38:21,464 --> 00:38:26,060
Yes, please. The awful thing is, there isn't
anything I can offer you to drink in the house.

530
00:38:26,135 --> 00:38:28,695
Why don't I run to the pub
and try to get something?

531
00:38:31,674 --> 00:38:37,408
Brad, I know this is going to sound awfully
ungrateful and stupid and ungenerous...

532
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,005
But you'd rather call it off for tonight?

533
00:38:40,082 --> 00:38:42,312
I understand.

534
00:38:42,385 --> 00:38:46,344
No, it's more than just that, Brad.
It's more than just tonight.

535
00:38:48,057 --> 00:38:53,154
Look, I hate saying this, but your not seeing
me isn't going to help that guy in the desert.

536
00:38:53,229 --> 00:38:55,220
We're still two lonely people.

537
00:38:57,333 --> 00:39:02,168
You think I'm pure and angel-like
because I'm English and my voice is crisp,

538
00:39:02,238 --> 00:39:04,570
and my father's a brigadier.

539
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,666
But I'm not pure and angel-like.

540
00:39:07,743 --> 00:39:10,940
I thought I'd be safe from you
because you're a stranger,

541
00:39:11,013 --> 00:39:15,347
far removed from John and his world
and everything that he stands for.

542
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:18,446
So I thought.

543
00:39:18,521 --> 00:39:20,989
I wish I could see you now
as I did on that first day,

544
00:39:21,057 --> 00:39:24,515
when you were so gay
and brash and good-looking,

545
00:39:24,594 --> 00:39:26,619
and very, very American.

546
00:39:26,696 --> 00:39:28,687
Not very endearing, but...

547
00:39:30,499 --> 00:39:32,967
Please go, Brad. Please say goodbye.

548
00:39:34,704 --> 00:39:38,538
- Valerie, honey...
- I asked you not to call me that.

549
00:39:38,608 --> 00:39:43,875
Look, I won't make a false move, I swear it,
now that I know it's that way or nothing.

550
00:39:43,946 --> 00:39:46,938
Please go, Brad.
You're not a stranger anymore.

551
00:39:48,684 --> 00:39:50,675
I'm sorry.

552
00:39:51,687 --> 00:39:55,418
Thanks for all the lovely outings,
and God bless.

553
00:40:26,689 --> 00:40:29,658
Go ahead and call her. Bayswater 7546.

554
00:40:29,725 --> 00:40:32,216
<i>- It's making me nervous.
- Making you nervous?</i>

555
00:40:32,295 --> 00:40:35,264
- How long you gonna keep this up?
- For the duration.

556
00:40:35,331 --> 00:40:37,856
I went by that Red Cross club last night.

557
00:40:37,934 --> 00:40:40,562
I didn't see anybody
looked like she's supposed to.

558
00:40:40,636 --> 00:40:44,072
Maybe she's sick or went out of town.
Maybe she got hit in an air-raid.

559
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:46,131
Who's to know the difference?

560
00:40:49,779 --> 00:40:52,441
- Got something good lined up?
- No, sir. Anyway...

561
00:40:52,515 --> 00:40:55,109
You're a married man
and it's none of my business.

562
00:40:55,184 --> 00:40:58,244
But this office is my business.
I want work out of every desk,

563
00:40:58,321 --> 00:41:02,849
notjust faster than Cantrell's section,
twice as fast, you understand?

564
00:41:02,925 --> 00:41:05,985
Oh, Parker? Hope you make third base.

565
00:41:14,904 --> 00:41:18,237
Now, if you don't mind
ajigsaw puzzle with two pieces missing...

566
00:41:18,307 --> 00:41:20,332
- Not at all.
- Pardon me, miss.

567
00:41:20,409 --> 00:41:23,901
- Yes, Captain?
- Is Miss Russell still working here?

568
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:29,077
- Valerie? Sure. I'll get her for you right away.
- No, please. It's all right. I...

569
00:41:30,152 --> 00:41:32,848
- Valerie, there's someone to see you.
- Oh.

570
00:41:35,391 --> 00:41:37,382
Brad.

571
00:41:38,561 --> 00:41:40,927
- Hi.
- Hello.

572
00:41:40,997 --> 00:41:43,830
I was just seeing if... if you were the same.

573
00:41:43,899 --> 00:41:46,993
- I've missed you too.
- You've had news?

574
00:41:47,069 --> 00:41:49,162
Three weeks ago. Wonderful news.

575
00:41:49,972 --> 00:41:53,271
You know, I kept thinking that
maybe you'd come to the club one day.

576
00:41:53,342 --> 00:41:55,333
Then I decided you wouldn't.

577
00:41:55,411 --> 00:41:58,471
That's a very nice compliment,
if only it'd been true, but...

578
00:41:58,547 --> 00:42:01,072
- I'm here.
- I'm so glad.

579
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:05,644
Well, now that we can trust ourselves
not to see each other, couldn't we maybe...

580
00:42:05,721 --> 00:42:09,657
- See each other?
- Tomorrow? If you're sure...

581
00:42:09,725 --> 00:42:11,989
- Terribly sure.
- 7:00.

582
00:42:12,995 --> 00:42:16,431
Brad, if you should change your mind,
please don't telephone me.

583
00:42:16,499 --> 00:42:19,491
It'd be better that way and I'll understand.

584
00:42:19,568 --> 00:42:21,559
I think you know I'll be there.

585
00:42:25,708 --> 00:42:28,643
I'm taking Daphne to
the French Club tonight. Wanna come?

586
00:42:28,711 --> 00:42:32,272
- No, thanks. I've got a date.
- About time. Something tangible, I trust?

587
00:42:32,348 --> 00:42:36,079
- Valerie.
- Intangible. Well, it's still about time.

588
00:42:36,152 --> 00:42:38,143
Parker!

589
00:42:42,758 --> 00:42:48,390
- Sir?
- Brad. You and I are going on a little trip.

590
00:42:48,464 --> 00:42:52,958
One of the best little trips we've ever made,
only one of us may not come back.

591
00:42:53,035 --> 00:42:55,902
Don't worry, Parker.
It won't be you. You'll be back.

592
00:42:55,971 --> 00:42:58,769
- Is it today, sir?
- You bet your life it's today.

593
00:42:58,841 --> 00:43:03,938
And all day tomorrow, too. Only, nobody's
to know. Not even that bunch out there.

594
00:43:04,013 --> 00:43:07,005
I have a dinner date, sir.
Have I permission to cancel it?

595
00:43:07,083 --> 00:43:10,109
- Absolutely no.
- It might look suspicious if I didn't.

596
00:43:10,186 --> 00:43:12,279
Let me tell you something
about security, Parker.

597
00:43:12,354 --> 00:43:14,379
You cancel a date and so do 12 other guys,

598
00:43:14,457 --> 00:43:16,891
soon it's all over London
that something's up.

599
00:43:16,959 --> 00:43:19,723
No, sir, info like that
could cost a thousand lives.

600
00:43:19,795 --> 00:43:24,095
In a minute, you and I walk out of here like
we're going for a drink. Is that understood?

601
00:43:24,166 --> 00:43:26,896
- Yes, sir.
- OK. Call Arkinson.

602
00:43:26,969 --> 00:43:28,994
Tell him to gas up the car.

603
00:43:29,071 --> 00:43:31,062
Yes, sir.

604
00:43:38,781 --> 00:43:41,215
What do you know about Operation Jubilee?

605
00:43:41,283 --> 00:43:44,741
Jubilee? I've heard the code name.
I don't know what it is.

606
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:48,278
You're about the only one.
Worst security I ever heard of.

607
00:43:48,357 --> 00:43:52,225
Wouldn't be surprised if the Germans
were waiting on the other side.

608
00:43:52,294 --> 00:43:55,923
- What is it? A raid?
- Bigger. About half a division.

609
00:43:55,998 --> 00:43:58,057
Canadians. Tanks, and everything.

610
00:43:58,134 --> 00:44:01,865
- Experimental assault.
- Are we going as observers?

611
00:44:01,937 --> 00:44:05,839
Not we, Brad. Me. Officially,
we're going as observers, both of us,

612
00:44:05,908 --> 00:44:08,001
to watch the embarkation.

613
00:44:08,077 --> 00:44:13,379
But strictly unofficially, a crazy coot called
Alex Timmer is going in with the Canadians.

614
00:44:13,449 --> 00:44:17,112
<i>Going on the assault without orders?</i>

615
00:44:17,186 --> 00:44:20,713
My friends always said Timmer'd either
come home a general or a corpse,

616
00:44:20,789 --> 00:44:22,780
and I guess they were right.

617
00:44:23,826 --> 00:44:26,795
Can you picture Ed Cantrell's face
when he hears the news?

618
00:44:26,862 --> 00:44:30,525
- I can picture the general's face, too.
- But secretly he'll be thinking

619
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:34,262
"That crazy coot Timmer's got
something the other guys don't have."

620
00:44:34,336 --> 00:44:39,205
Listen, they're scouting around for somebody
to take over Plans up at Second Corps.

621
00:44:39,275 --> 00:44:41,505
The job calls for chickens up here.

622
00:44:41,577 --> 00:44:45,946
Rumor's up and down the hall it's between
Ed Cantrell and me. Now d'you get it?

623
00:44:46,015 --> 00:44:48,142
How did you arrange the deal, Colonel?

624
00:44:48,217 --> 00:44:51,983
Buddy of mine, wonderful guy from
up Toronto way, battalion commander.

625
00:44:52,054 --> 00:44:55,114
- He fixed it up.
- Can you tell me where the assault goes?

626
00:44:55,257 --> 00:44:57,589
Yeah. Dieppe.

627
00:44:58,327 --> 00:45:00,727
- Where?
- Dieppe, on the French coast.

628
00:45:02,097 --> 00:45:04,588
And if you ask me, it's gonna be murder.

629
00:45:13,909 --> 00:45:15,900
Alex, you old fool!

630
00:45:17,046 --> 00:45:19,606
Hiya, Dunc. You didn't
think I was gonna miss it?

631
00:45:19,682 --> 00:45:22,708
You nearly did. We're about to leave.
It'll be quite a party.

632
00:45:22,785 --> 00:45:25,447
- We've been to parties before.
- Not like this, baby.

633
00:45:25,521 --> 00:45:27,546
Oh, Colonel Harkness, Captain Parker.

634
00:45:27,623 --> 00:45:30,854
- Nice knowing you. Sorry we can't bring you.
- Some other time.

635
00:45:30,926 --> 00:45:34,521
- Sure, some other time. Come on, Alex.
- Be right with you.

636
00:45:35,831 --> 00:45:39,961
Brad, zero's at 0430 hours in the morning.

637
00:45:40,035 --> 00:45:42,833
Wait for me.
I'll be back sometime tomorrow afternoon.

638
00:45:42,905 --> 00:45:47,467
Brad, if I don't show, there are a couple
of letters in the center drawer of my desk.

639
00:45:47,543 --> 00:45:50,535
- Stick 'em in the mailbox, will ya?
- Yes, sir.

640
00:45:50,613 --> 00:45:52,740
I was just thinking.

641
00:45:52,815 --> 00:45:57,377
Wouldn't it be like Ed Cantrell to walk off
with the jackpot without gambling a dime?

642
00:45:57,453 --> 00:45:59,444
- See you tomorrow, sir.
- Yeah.

643
00:46:00,623 --> 00:46:02,557
Tomorrow.

644
00:46:32,221 --> 00:46:34,314
<i>Good hunting, men. Good hunting.</i>

645
00:46:35,491 --> 00:46:38,255
Remember, jolly good hunting.

646
00:46:47,803 --> 00:46:49,794
<i>Hi, there.</i>

647
00:46:49,872 --> 00:46:52,238
- Hi.
- Good to see you.

648
00:46:52,308 --> 00:46:55,141
- It's been a long time.
- When did you get back?

649
00:47:28,176 --> 00:47:31,043
- Is this all the casualty lists?
- So far, sir.

650
00:47:31,112 --> 00:47:35,742
All we go in the line of Yanks is a couple
of rangers, a captain and a warrant officer.

651
00:47:35,817 --> 00:47:38,513
Thanks anyway for your trouble, Sergeant.

652
00:47:39,621 --> 00:47:42,089
<i>- The surprise landing...
- Are you upset?</i>

653
00:47:42,157 --> 00:47:45,888
- Your boyfriend isn't on that, is he?
- The Dieppe raid? No, thank goodness.

654
00:47:45,961 --> 00:47:48,486
- No, he's an American.
- I didn't think it was likely.

655
00:47:48,563 --> 00:47:52,556
Fellow was saying just now we have
hardly more than a dozen guys down there.

656
00:47:52,634 --> 00:47:55,364
<i>.. near the Dieppe Casino. Further bulletin...</i>

657
00:47:55,437 --> 00:47:58,668
Georgina, did you say
some Americans are at Dieppe?

658
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:01,231
That's right, just a handful, though.

659
00:48:01,309 --> 00:48:04,904
Gee, honey, I hope I didn't put
a wrong idea into your head.

660
00:48:22,264 --> 00:48:26,291
- Still no luck, Captain?
- The last ship arrived half an hour ago.

661
00:48:27,335 --> 00:48:31,294
Hey, what do you think of this?
A German helmet, cost me 45 bucks.

662
00:48:32,607 --> 00:48:34,598
Colonel Timmer!

663
00:48:37,712 --> 00:48:40,476
Just about given you up, sir. Glad to see you.

664
00:48:47,889 --> 00:48:50,119
<i>Let's roll, huh?</i>

665
00:49:04,372 --> 00:49:09,537
I never got to shore. Our LCl took
a direct hit a hundred yards out.

666
00:49:10,946 --> 00:49:13,744
One shot, Parker,
and those boys were all mashed up.

667
00:49:13,815 --> 00:49:17,808
So help me,
one shot and they were all mashed up.

668
00:49:18,653 --> 00:49:20,814
You were lucky to get out, Colonel.

669
00:49:25,894 --> 00:49:29,728
- Old Dunc Harkness got hit bad.
- I'm sorry to hear that, sir.

670
00:49:29,798 --> 00:49:33,131
Took his battalion in where it's just murder.

671
00:49:33,201 --> 00:49:38,229
Takes guts to give orders like that in the
military business, but you just gotta have it.

672
00:49:38,306 --> 00:49:41,673
Twice. I was exploded in the water twice.

673
00:49:43,812 --> 00:49:46,975
Arkinson, stop at the next pub.
Go in and bring out a bottle.

674
00:49:47,048 --> 00:49:51,712
They won't sell by the bottle less they know
you, Colonel. You have to drink bit by bit.

675
00:49:51,786 --> 00:49:54,550
Artillery was deadly. Deadly.

676
00:49:55,423 --> 00:49:59,723
Second time I hit the water, I was naked
as a baby. No Mae West, no nothing.

677
00:49:59,794 --> 00:50:02,228
And they were
machine-gunning me out there.

678
00:50:02,297 --> 00:50:07,200
All the time I kept thinkin' "Those
Kraut gunners got orders: get Timmer."

679
00:50:10,672 --> 00:50:12,697
Pull up ahead there, Arkinson.

680
00:50:12,774 --> 00:50:15,971
Come on, Parker,
you could do with a snort yourself.

681
00:50:23,284 --> 00:50:25,343
- Two double Scotch.
- Soda or water, sir?

682
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:28,014
- Neat.
- Very good, sir.

683
00:50:28,089 --> 00:50:31,024
I just can't wait to see that Ed Cantrell's face.

684
00:50:36,164 --> 00:50:39,793
Go ahead, Colonel. I'll get mine next time.
Two more here, please.

685
00:50:39,868 --> 00:50:43,599
Sorry, mate, but you've had the limit as it is.
One whiskey per customer.

686
00:50:43,671 --> 00:50:45,662
<i>That's the rule this week.</i>

687
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:47,935
Just a minute.

688
00:50:48,009 --> 00:50:51,206
- Where were you this afternoon?
- This afternoon, sir?

689
00:50:51,279 --> 00:50:54,476
Well, I was out in the back,
digging up the potato patch.

690
00:50:54,549 --> 00:50:57,074
Is that right? Well, I was at Dieppe.

691
00:50:58,553 --> 00:51:01,386
Oh, I see. Well, in that case, sir...

692
00:51:01,456 --> 00:51:04,050
Did I understand you to say
that you were at Dieppe?

693
00:51:04,125 --> 00:51:06,491
- That's right.
- But aren't you an American?

694
00:51:06,561 --> 00:51:09,530
- Just who are you?
- Associated Press. Grainger's my name.

695
00:51:09,597 --> 00:51:12,896
I was at Southampton all day.
You're the only American I've seen.

696
00:51:12,967 --> 00:51:17,427
I went along as an observer.
I'm from headquarters. I volunteered.

697
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:22,936
You know how it is. There's going
to be a lot of this sort of thing up ahead.

698
00:51:23,011 --> 00:51:25,741
You wanna get the feel of it,
the sooner the better.

699
00:51:25,814 --> 00:51:28,783
- And jolly creditable of you, too.
- Colonel Timmer, sir.

700
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:32,217
- Is it OK if I get me a quick belt, too?
- Yeah, go ahead.

701
00:51:32,287 --> 00:51:35,552
What section of headquarters
do you work in, Colonel Timmer?

702
00:51:35,623 --> 00:51:37,614
- Why, I...
- Pardon me, Colonel.

703
00:51:37,692 --> 00:51:40,092
Don't you think we should be on our way?

704
00:51:41,362 --> 00:51:43,387
Maybe you're right.

705
00:51:43,465 --> 00:51:47,094
- Well, to the next one.
- What?

706
00:51:47,168 --> 00:51:49,659
<i>Oh, yes. Quite.</i>

707
00:51:49,737 --> 00:51:54,106
I guess Mr. Lieutenant-Colonel Ed Cantrell
lost his big chance, huh?

708
00:51:54,175 --> 00:51:56,769
- I guess so, sir.
- This crazy coot went to France,

709
00:51:56,845 --> 00:51:59,643
and got back all in one piece, right, Brad?

710
00:51:59,714 --> 00:52:01,648
That'll shake 'em, eh?

711
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:16,220
Hello. Is Captain Parker there, please?

712
00:52:17,432 --> 00:52:20,424
Yes, this is Valerie.
You must be Captain Boyce.

713
00:52:21,936 --> 00:52:23,927
No, I haven't either. Not a word.

714
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:31,005
Are you allowed to tell me if Brad could
possibly have been on the Dieppe raid?

715
00:52:33,181 --> 00:52:35,172
Oh, I see.

716
00:52:36,284 --> 00:52:38,479
No, you're very kind.

717
00:52:38,553 --> 00:52:40,544
It's very sweet of you, no.

718
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:45,951
Yes. If Brad should come back,
would you tell him that I said

719
00:52:46,027 --> 00:52:48,495
that I hoped that he would let me know...

720
00:52:49,497 --> 00:52:51,488
No, it doesn't matter how late.

721
00:53:21,729 --> 00:53:24,289
Brad!

722
00:53:35,944 --> 00:53:38,174
- Brad.
- Valerie.

723
00:53:38,246 --> 00:53:41,477
Oh, Brad, I'm so glad you're all right.

724
00:53:41,549 --> 00:53:43,540
I'm so glad.

725
00:53:50,291 --> 00:53:52,282
Oh, I'm so glad.

726
00:54:02,504 --> 00:54:04,597
Wham the hewgag, beat the drums

727
00:54:04,672 --> 00:54:06,503
- What was that?
- Old song.

728
00:54:06,574 --> 00:54:10,135
- Hail, the conquering hero comes
- All right, Ray, knock it off.

729
00:54:10,211 --> 00:54:12,975
I'll be all three monkeys.
Hear no, see no, speak no.

730
00:54:13,047 --> 00:54:17,484
<i>- The Colonel in?
- In his office, no. In the Daily Express, yes.</i>

731
00:54:17,552 --> 00:54:20,112
"Splendid evidence
of Allied cooperation came from

732
00:54:20,188 --> 00:54:23,055
a high-ranking officer
of the U.S. headquarters command."

733
00:54:23,124 --> 00:54:28,255
"Lieutenant-Colonel Timmer volunteered
to cross the Channel with the Canadians."

734
00:54:28,329 --> 00:54:33,028
Pay attention, man.
This little article here has already borne fruit.

735
00:54:33,101 --> 00:54:36,832
That order came from
the general's office not ten minutes ago.

736
00:54:36,905 --> 00:54:39,601
Wow. Just when I wanted
to ask him a favor, too.

737
00:54:39,674 --> 00:54:42,768
<i>Well, maybe he won't see it for a while.</i>

738
00:54:42,844 --> 00:54:45,074
<i>- Morning.
- Morning, sir.</i>

739
00:54:46,014 --> 00:54:50,280
- Colonel, could I see you for a moment?
- Yeah, sure. Come on in, Brad.

740
00:54:53,221 --> 00:54:55,212
Go ahead, Brad. Shoot.

741
00:54:55,356 --> 00:54:57,756
Sir, I've got some back leave due me.

742
00:54:57,825 --> 00:55:02,353
What are my chances of getting to the coast
for two days? Saturday till Sunday noon?

743
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:04,398
Oh, I thought you wanted
to talk about something else.

744
00:55:04,465 --> 00:55:07,025
- Don't you read the newspapers?
- Yes, sir, I do.

745
00:55:07,101 --> 00:55:10,036
- Pretty good, huh?
- I don't think it'll do any harm.

746
00:55:10,104 --> 00:55:12,095
Do any harm?

747
00:55:13,374 --> 00:55:16,935
Oh, you read this order.

748
00:55:17,011 --> 00:55:19,002
Well, it doesn't mean a thing.

749
00:55:19,213 --> 00:55:21,204
I hope you're right, sir.

750
00:55:23,785 --> 00:55:26,583
- Uh, Colonel, what I wanted to ask was...
- Yeah, I know.

751
00:55:26,654 --> 00:55:30,385
You're worried about the order that
nobody talks to newspapers.

752
00:55:30,458 --> 00:55:33,359
- Right.
- Let me tell you something, Brad.

753
00:55:33,428 --> 00:55:36,056
I know this army. All their little tricks.

754
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:40,464
First they give you a rap over the knuckles.
Just for the record. Gets 'em off the hook.

755
00:55:40,535 --> 00:55:43,766
But a story like this in the newspapers
has gotta do the army good.

756
00:55:43,838 --> 00:55:46,432
- Itjust has to.
- I hope you're right, sir.

757
00:55:46,808 --> 00:55:48,969
- As a matter of fact, I...
- The answer is no.

758
00:55:49,043 --> 00:55:51,739
We're sweating out plans
for the invasion of Africa.

759
00:55:51,813 --> 00:55:54,475
- Till the landing, nobody gets a leave.
- Sorry, sir.

760
00:55:54,549 --> 00:55:57,541
After the boys land, maybe
you can have a day or so. We'll see.

761
00:55:57,619 --> 00:56:00,144
<i>Yeah?</i>

762
00:56:00,221 --> 00:56:02,849
Well, if it isn't my old friend, Ed Cantrell!

763
00:56:02,924 --> 00:56:04,915
<i>Alex.</i>

764
00:56:13,001 --> 00:56:14,992
Sit yourself, Alex.

765
00:56:16,738 --> 00:56:18,899
Congratulations, Colonel.

766
00:56:18,973 --> 00:56:22,306
Thanks. And you too.

767
00:56:55,677 --> 00:57:00,011
By the way, did you want
adjoining rooms? I forgot to ask.

768
00:57:01,482 --> 00:57:04,508
- Uh...
- We haven't any adjoining, I'm afraid.

769
00:57:04,585 --> 00:57:07,486
- Is that all right?
- Yes, perfectly all right.

770
00:57:11,059 --> 00:57:15,393
If you don't mind the wind, sir,
you've time for a nice walk before tea.

771
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:18,221
This way, madam, please.

772
00:57:21,436 --> 00:57:23,427
This way, if you please, sir.

773
00:57:41,155 --> 00:57:45,285
- Oh, Brad, it's awful. I feel so guilty.
- What about?

774
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:49,728
Well, I told you this would be a nice place,
and it's gonna come down in buckets.

775
00:57:49,797 --> 00:57:53,927
I like it. I like the wind, I like the black clouds.

776
00:57:54,001 --> 00:57:56,595
And I like it because you used to live here.

777
00:57:56,671 --> 00:57:58,662
And not so long ago, either.

778
00:57:59,841 --> 00:58:03,777
200 dreary little schoolgirls
in a line along the sea front.

779
00:58:04,612 --> 00:58:07,103
"Russell! Keep in step there!"

780
00:58:07,181 --> 00:58:09,775
<i>And if you didn't, you got your ears boxed.</i>

781
00:58:09,851 --> 00:58:13,378
<i>Yeah, those people on the Mayflower
knew what they were doing.</i>

782
00:58:13,454 --> 00:58:15,581
Sometimes I wonder about that, even now.

783
00:58:15,656 --> 00:58:17,647
- You do, eh?
- Yes.

784
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:32,537
- Oh!
- Hey! Come on.

785
00:58:42,683 --> 00:58:44,674
- Oh.
- Oh, here.

786
00:58:51,726 --> 00:58:54,559
Oh, Brad, are we really sinners,
just by being in love?

787
00:58:54,629 --> 00:58:57,063
- Why ask me?
- You're from New England.

788
00:58:57,131 --> 00:58:59,998
- You're supposed to know.
- All right. I'll tell you.

789
00:59:00,067 --> 00:59:05,403
You're probably the most innocent and
most beautiful sinner in the whole wide war.

790
00:59:05,473 --> 00:59:08,033
Oh, and you're the most exciting.

791
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:15,681
People like to blame the war
for everything, don't they?

792
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:17,741
Sure, when there's one to blame.

793
00:59:18,886 --> 00:59:21,047
- Oh, I'm cold.
- Yeah?

794
00:59:21,122 --> 00:59:23,113
Mm.

795
00:59:24,091 --> 00:59:26,082
- Brad.
- Huh?

796
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,958
- There's a fire in my room.
- Yeah?

797
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:31,760
No, no. Wait a minute. A real, blazing fire?

798
00:59:31,833 --> 00:59:34,666
Or one of those English things
made out of damp smoke?

799
00:59:34,735 --> 00:59:38,102
A real blazing fire. And we'll have tea there.

800
00:59:40,474 --> 00:59:44,274
- The African landings went well, didn't they?
- Yeah, and am I proud.

801
00:59:44,345 --> 00:59:46,472
I wielded a very valiant pencil.

802
00:59:46,547 --> 00:59:48,606
Oh, darling, that's childish.

803
00:59:48,683 --> 00:59:52,175
You know that in this war, you just
take what they give you, that's all.

804
00:59:52,253 --> 00:59:54,847
Is it? John volunteered.

805
00:59:55,723 --> 00:59:57,714
Well, he did, didn't he?

806
00:59:57,792 --> 01:00:00,192
- Yes.
- So...

807
01:00:00,261 --> 01:00:05,130
So I've prayed every night that they wouldn't
take you and that they'd leave you here.

808
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:08,532
You're wrong.
Wonderful, beautiful, but wrong.

809
01:00:08,603 --> 01:00:10,867
- I know.
- And I'm wrong.

810
01:00:10,938 --> 01:00:13,406
And right now I don't care. I love you.

811
01:00:13,474 --> 01:00:15,465
Come on.

812
01:00:17,812 --> 01:00:18,344
<i>Anyone not assigned to fifth
division, Iceland, can thank his lucky stars.</i>

813
01:00:18,379 --> 01:00:22,281
<i>Anyone not assigned to fifth
division, Iceland, can thank his lucky stars.</i>

814
01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:25,342
Believe me, you're not gonna
like him any better than I do,

815
01:00:25,419 --> 01:00:28,411
but that's the way it is in this man's army.

816
01:00:28,489 --> 01:00:30,957
- Sorry to be late, sir.
- Forget it, boy.

817
01:00:31,292 --> 01:00:35,991
I... I was just telling the men
it doesn't pay to break your back doing ajob.

818
01:00:36,063 --> 01:00:38,896
Our reward just came down from on high.

819
01:00:38,966 --> 01:00:41,560
Looks like a bunch of diplomas, doesn't it?

820
01:00:41,636 --> 01:00:43,627
But it's not. They're orders.

821
01:00:44,672 --> 01:00:47,607
The team's busted up. How do you like it?

822
01:00:47,675 --> 01:00:50,974
Crandall to Second Corps, Washington.
Marcus to OPD.

823
01:00:51,045 --> 01:00:55,277
Halloran to AFHQ, Algiers.
Well, there they are, men. Pick a winner.

824
01:01:04,592 --> 01:01:08,323
Hey, luck's holding, Brad.
Free French liaison right here in London.

825
01:01:08,396 --> 01:01:10,591
Me for the solid life. What'd you draw?

826
01:01:10,665 --> 01:01:14,157
- I haven't looked.
- Go ahead. It only hurts for a minute.

827
01:01:18,572 --> 01:01:21,336
- What happens to you, Colonel?
- Me?

828
01:01:22,209 --> 01:01:25,042
Operation Burial.
Down to Movement Control.

829
01:01:26,047 --> 01:01:28,379
Looks like they're trying to get rid of me.

830
01:01:28,449 --> 01:01:30,815
You know something?
I'm gonna help 'em out.

831
01:01:30,885 --> 01:01:35,822
I'm gonna get into a combat outfit if
I have to take a bust down to captain to do it.

832
01:01:36,857 --> 01:01:39,553
How'd they cut your throat?

833
01:01:39,627 --> 01:01:44,121
Allied Force Headquarters, Algiers.
First available aircraft.

834
01:01:44,198 --> 01:01:47,463
Maybe I can get a transfer to
a combat outfit too, here in England.

835
01:01:47,535 --> 01:01:50,231
Aren't you on limited service?
Broke your leg jumping?

836
01:01:50,304 --> 01:01:52,898
You know as well as I do,
with my combat training...

837
01:01:52,974 --> 01:01:57,604
Sure, I know, Brad. Right now that'll do you
as much good as a slip from the chaplain.

838
01:01:57,678 --> 01:02:02,775
I'm afraid you're stuck with it, and there
isn't a thing in the world I can do to help.

839
01:02:11,726 --> 01:02:13,717
Still no luck, huh?

840
01:02:14,862 --> 01:02:17,660
Well, relax. Pour yourself a Sunday drink.

841
01:02:17,732 --> 01:02:20,166
After all, you could do worse than Algiers.

842
01:02:20,234 --> 01:02:23,533
- Hey, the Kasbah, boy.
- That isn't funny.

843
01:02:23,604 --> 01:02:28,234
OK. I'll play it straight. I do know
somebody who's going to be happy.

844
01:02:28,309 --> 01:02:30,300
- Who?
- Mrs. Brad Parker.

845
01:02:30,378 --> 01:02:33,779
- That's ridiculous.
- Think she hasn't guessed from your letters?

846
01:02:33,848 --> 01:02:37,375
You don't know Janie. She's not like that.
That makes it worse in a way.

847
01:02:37,451 --> 01:02:39,612
What do you mean?
She's a woman, ain't she?

848
01:02:43,491 --> 01:02:45,482
Hello?

849
01:02:45,559 --> 01:02:47,550
Yes, sir.

850
01:02:49,230 --> 01:02:51,357
Yes, I will.

851
01:02:51,432 --> 01:02:55,732
Yes, I have it. Takeoff at 1700. Thank you.

852
01:02:59,507 --> 01:03:02,533
- Try the Red Cross club on your way.
- It's her day off.

853
01:03:02,610 --> 01:03:05,477
Well, leave her a note. It's all you can do.

854
01:03:05,546 --> 01:03:07,537
Yeah, I guess it's all I can do.

855
01:03:15,689 --> 01:03:19,216
Oh, Captain Parker. Valerie left this for you.

856
01:03:19,293 --> 01:03:22,126
- Where is she?
- I imagine she's in Barkstow by now.

857
01:03:22,196 --> 01:03:24,892
- Barkstow?
- She had to go to make the arrangements.

858
01:03:24,965 --> 01:03:27,433
- What arrangements?
- For the services.

859
01:03:27,501 --> 01:03:31,301
Oh, you haven't heard?
Her father died last night.

860
01:03:31,372 --> 01:03:33,602
Died? How?

861
01:03:33,674 --> 01:03:36,643
Someone said
the War Office turned him down.

862
01:03:36,710 --> 01:03:38,871
He killed himself.

863
01:03:38,946 --> 01:03:41,107
Poor Valerie. I feel awful for her.

864
01:03:42,716 --> 01:03:44,707
Thank you.

865
01:04:05,505 --> 01:04:08,702
<i>OK, come and get it. Mail call.
Come and get it, guys.</i>

866
01:04:11,711 --> 01:04:13,702
- Here's one for Palmer.
- Right here.

867
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:15,771
- Paducci.
- Ho!

868
01:04:15,849 --> 01:04:17,840
- One for you, Puchani.
- Sergeant?

869
01:04:17,917 --> 01:04:19,748
- Yes, sir.
- Anything for me?

870
01:04:19,819 --> 01:04:22,049
I believe there is, Captain Parker.

871
01:04:23,556 --> 01:04:25,547
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, thank you.

872
01:04:33,266 --> 01:04:35,393
<i>"My darling."</i>

873
01:04:35,468 --> 01:04:37,993
<i>"John is wounded and in hospital in Italy. "</i>

874
01:04:38,838 --> 01:04:40,965
<i>"I should only be thinking about him,</i>

875
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:45,807
<i>but all that's in my mind tonight is that
it's been ten whole months since you left."</i>

876
01:04:45,879 --> 01:04:47,870
<i>"300 empty days."</i>

877
01:04:49,149 --> 01:04:53,483
<i>"There's an air raid going on, just
a small one, on the other side of London."</i>

878
01:04:53,553 --> 01:04:58,047
<i>"The daffodils are in bloom in the park
and they don't mind the noise a bit."</i>

879
01:05:00,527 --> 01:05:04,156
Private Parker! Front and center!
Get your socks and hit the docks!

880
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:07,290
Dan! Boy, are you lost?
This isn't Fort Henderson!

881
01:05:07,367 --> 01:05:10,803
- I had a hunch you'd be in this place.
- Hey, look who's a major!

882
01:05:10,870 --> 01:05:14,829
And glad to be. That gold-leaf moola counts.
How long you been in this hellhole?

883
01:05:14,908 --> 01:05:18,207
Eight months. You must be
pretty good at killing Germans, too.

884
01:05:18,278 --> 01:05:21,543
Well, my employers are satisfied.
Piccadilly, here I come.

885
01:05:21,614 --> 01:05:23,605
- Piccadilly?
- That's right.

886
01:05:23,683 --> 01:05:26,151
- How'd you get it?
- Give me a drink, I'll tell you.

887
01:05:26,219 --> 01:05:29,484
- That I'll do. Come on.
- Wait for Papa, Lovell.

888
01:05:37,096 --> 01:05:39,087
- There you are.
- Thank you.

889
01:05:41,968 --> 01:05:43,959
Mm. Don't tell me.

890
01:05:46,506 --> 01:05:48,531
Oh, that's good rubbing alcohol.

891
01:05:48,608 --> 01:05:52,738
- How'd you wangle a transfer to England?
- They're getting ready for the big show.

892
01:05:52,812 --> 01:05:56,179
Yeah, I know. Go on,
give me all the details, how you worked it.

893
01:05:56,249 --> 01:06:00,151
You thinking about yourself?
Nah, you don't want a combat outfit.

894
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:02,814
Not with that doll of yours and all back home.

895
01:06:02,889 --> 01:06:07,053
I remember her from camp that time.
She's too beautiful to cry.

896
01:06:07,126 --> 01:06:10,994
- Yeah, she liked you too. Now go on, tell me.
- Are you nuts, boy?

897
01:06:11,064 --> 01:06:14,898
Listen, when I got embarkation leave,
I figured I might bump into you,

898
01:06:14,968 --> 01:06:17,368
so I called her
on the telephone, long-distance,

899
01:06:17,437 --> 01:06:19,632
reversing the charges.

900
01:06:19,706 --> 01:06:22,140
- You called Janie?
- Yep.

901
01:06:22,208 --> 01:06:24,267
She sounded pretty choked up.

902
01:06:24,344 --> 01:06:27,836
Finally, she said
"If you do see him, tell him I love him."

903
01:06:27,914 --> 01:06:30,712
Janie doesn't talk like that.
She hardly knows you.

904
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:34,116
- She really goes for you, boy.
- Itjust doesn't sound like her.

905
01:06:34,187 --> 01:06:36,712
- Something's changed.
- Maybe you have.

906
01:06:37,857 --> 01:06:39,848
Answer my question, Dan.

907
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:43,093
- You still hipped on England?
- More than ever.

908
01:06:43,162 --> 01:06:45,687
- Dame?
- A girl I love.

909
01:06:46,499 --> 01:06:48,626
Dame.

910
01:06:48,701 --> 01:06:52,137
OK. It's a special force of volunteers.

911
01:06:52,205 --> 01:06:55,333
You'll need pull to make it,
all the boys are hand-picked.

912
01:06:55,408 --> 01:06:58,536
- How's that leg of yours?
- It's OK. What's this force called?

913
01:06:58,611 --> 01:07:03,514
Special Force Six. It's a mixed bunch.
Gls, Canadians, limeys.

914
01:07:03,583 --> 01:07:07,019
I don't go for them limeys.
They talk fast but fight slow.

915
01:07:07,086 --> 01:07:10,613
The commander's OK, though.
He's from my home town, Minneapolis.

916
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:13,750
- What's his name?
- Timmer. He's a chicken colonel.

917
01:07:13,826 --> 01:07:15,919
- Alex Timmer?
- Yeah. You know him?

918
01:07:15,995 --> 01:07:18,657
- Just give me his APO.
- I don't know it.

919
01:07:18,731 --> 01:07:21,199
Come to think of it, I don't even need it.

920
01:07:36,416 --> 01:07:38,407
Brad!

921
01:07:44,123 --> 01:07:46,114
- I need a shave.
- Oh, I don't care.

922
01:07:46,192 --> 01:07:48,353
- It'll scratch your face.
- Let it.

923
01:07:48,428 --> 01:07:51,625
- I wasn't sure you'd be here.
- Oh, I'd have crawled.

924
01:07:53,166 --> 01:07:55,293
- You won't let me look at you.
- Not yet.

925
01:07:55,368 --> 01:07:57,928
I don't want you
to get tired of looking at me.

926
01:07:58,004 --> 01:07:59,995
- That's because you're ugly.
- I know.

927
01:08:00,073 --> 01:08:03,236
Let me. Let me look at your ugly face.

928
01:08:03,810 --> 01:08:06,176
I'm home, darling, I'm home.

929
01:08:06,245 --> 01:08:08,236
Ten days before I have to report.

930
01:08:20,226 --> 01:08:22,217
Breakfast.

931
01:08:22,295 --> 01:08:25,787
The times I've dreamed
of being here, just like this.

932
01:08:25,865 --> 01:08:28,425
Yes. Every night and every day.

933
01:08:28,501 --> 01:08:30,731
With you looking just the way you do.

934
01:08:32,505 --> 01:08:35,133
And no war, no going back, and no ending.

935
01:08:35,208 --> 01:08:37,870
None of it. Not here. Not where we are.

936
01:08:45,685 --> 01:08:48,483
When she writes to you... does she know?

937
01:08:49,756 --> 01:08:53,783
She knows. She never says it
in her letters, but she knows.

938
01:08:54,961 --> 01:08:57,259
- What about John?
- No.

939
01:08:59,165 --> 01:09:04,000
No. All we ever had together
was... was trust, that's all.

940
01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:06,129
Don't think that way.

941
01:09:06,205 --> 01:09:08,332
You mean I've lost the right to?

942
01:09:08,408 --> 01:09:10,399
Now stop.

943
01:09:11,811 --> 01:09:15,406
But I do. Not often, but I do think that way.

944
01:09:16,983 --> 01:09:19,076
And... Oh, kiss me.

945
01:09:31,364 --> 01:09:33,355
Oh, wretched, isn't it, sir?

946
01:09:35,601 --> 01:09:39,833
We can't land for a few minutes.
There's an air alert in London.

947
01:09:39,906 --> 01:09:43,501
Well, after 20 months,
another few minutes won't matter.

948
01:09:44,944 --> 01:09:47,913
I will get past
the medical officer on the field, won't I?

949
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:52,849
You shouldn't. But if it's that important to
you, I'll give you a pill to carry you through.

950
01:09:52,919 --> 01:09:54,910
Thank you.

951
01:10:03,963 --> 01:10:05,954
Who's he?

952
01:10:17,944 --> 01:10:20,913
Hey, at last, the guest of honor.
Where's Valerie?

953
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:23,278
Meeting me here. What goes on?

954
01:10:23,349 --> 01:10:26,284
Well, your fierce-looking
friend here dropped in on you.

955
01:10:26,352 --> 01:10:28,820
- What are you doing here?
- Taking a break.

956
01:10:28,888 --> 01:10:32,688
All of a sudden, this crazy captain
whistles up a whole flock of dames.

957
01:10:32,758 --> 01:10:36,694
- When are you reporting to Timmer?
- When my leave's up. Not a minute before.

958
01:10:36,762 --> 01:10:38,923
- Here you are, Dan.
- Thanks, baby.

959
01:10:38,998 --> 01:10:44,459
This kid's a good gin drinker, just like me. We
got a lot more in common than gin, eh, baby?

960
01:10:55,147 --> 01:10:58,275
I hate to have Valerie
barge in on a rat race like this.

961
01:10:58,351 --> 01:11:03,584
Listen, this is London in war. Valerie knows
what it's all about, don't kid yourself.

962
01:11:14,166 --> 01:11:16,157
- Hello, Ray.
- Baby.

963
01:11:16,235 --> 01:11:18,226
- Is that it?
- That is it.

964
01:11:18,304 --> 01:11:21,899
- Mm. Overboard, huh?
- Both of 'em. Without life jackets.

965
01:11:35,221 --> 01:11:37,485
- Valerie, this is Dan.
- Hi, Valerie.

966
01:11:37,557 --> 01:11:39,889
- Uh...
- Suzette. My name is Suzette. Hello.

967
01:11:39,959 --> 01:11:42,951
- Ray you know, and Miss...
- Mrs. Hamilton.

968
01:11:43,029 --> 01:11:45,964
- How do you do?
- Ray, excuse us. We gotta run out on you.

969
01:11:46,032 --> 01:11:49,365
- Oh, no.
- It's a shame, but I'm afraid we do have to.

970
01:11:49,435 --> 01:11:52,233
I love parties
that erupt out of nowhere, don't you?

971
01:11:52,305 --> 01:11:54,296
So do I. Come on, darling.

972
01:11:54,373 --> 01:11:57,638
What will we do when suddenly
the whistle blows, the war's over,

973
01:11:57,710 --> 01:12:00,941
and we all have to scurry home
to our own husbands and wives?

974
01:12:01,013 --> 01:12:03,038
Simple. Go back to 'em.

975
01:12:03,115 --> 01:12:05,345
A drink, please, darling. A stiff one.

976
01:12:05,418 --> 01:12:08,410
- I've a feeling I'll need it tonight.
- Say when.

977
01:12:11,324 --> 01:12:13,315
Good evening, Colonel.

978
01:12:19,031 --> 01:12:22,159
- Bit weak on the pins, eh, Colonel?
- I'll be all right.

979
01:12:34,447 --> 01:12:36,438
I'm sorry.

980
01:12:37,650 --> 01:12:39,982
Looking for anyone, Colonel?

981
01:12:40,052 --> 01:12:42,043
I'm looking for Miss Russell.

982
01:12:43,322 --> 01:12:45,517
Go ahead, stretch out.

983
01:12:45,591 --> 01:12:49,027
Go ahead. It's been
stretched out on many times before.

984
01:12:50,062 --> 01:12:52,053
There you are.

985
01:12:52,131 --> 01:12:55,532
- Miss Russell? You mean Val?
- Yes.

986
01:12:55,601 --> 01:12:59,367
Colonel, I thought you were celebrating.
You're a sick man.

987
01:12:59,438 --> 01:13:02,669
Uh... Georgina,
do you know where Val was going?

988
01:13:02,875 --> 01:13:06,709
She went out with her boyfriend.
Captain Brad something. Parker.

989
01:13:06,779 --> 01:13:09,771
- Where is he billeted?
- Um... Sloane 8347.

990
01:13:09,849 --> 01:13:11,840
Sloane 8347.

991
01:13:11,917 --> 01:13:15,648
Now, you just hold still a minute
and I'll try to get her on the phone.

992
01:13:15,721 --> 01:13:19,350
Please don't bother her now.
I... I just came by on the chance.

993
01:13:19,425 --> 01:13:21,985
Nonsense. I'll get her
on the phone right away.

994
01:13:22,061 --> 01:13:24,120
You just sit there and take it easy.

995
01:13:29,969 --> 01:13:31,994
Boyce's apartment.

996
01:13:32,071 --> 01:13:34,369
Who? Hold it, I'll see.

997
01:13:35,374 --> 01:13:38,207
- Is there a party here named Russell?
- Yes.

998
01:13:38,277 --> 01:13:40,268
- It's for you.
- Oh.

999
01:13:42,982 --> 01:13:44,449
Hello?

1000
01:13:44,517 --> 01:13:49,648
Valerie? Just a minute, honey. Someone
here would like to speak with you, if...

1001
01:13:49,722 --> 01:13:53,988
The party's left. He was here just
a minute ago. Maybe he's gone up to the café.

1002
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:55,391
But who is it?

1003
01:13:55,461 --> 01:13:59,329
An English colonel with a green beret.
He was so weak he could hardly stand.

1004
01:13:59,398 --> 01:14:02,026
Oh, no. I'll be right over.

1005
01:14:03,502 --> 01:14:05,902
- It's John.
- Where?

1006
01:14:05,971 --> 01:14:10,840
He's looking for me, and the girl in
the Red Cross club said that he was waiting.

1007
01:14:12,611 --> 01:14:15,205
- I'll take you.
- No, darling, I don't want that.

1008
01:14:15,281 --> 01:14:17,272
I'll try and telephone you later.

1009
01:14:17,349 --> 01:14:19,340
- Try?
- Yes, I'll try.

1010
01:14:23,456 --> 01:14:27,916
- What are you going to tell him?
- I don't know. What difference does it make?

1011
01:14:27,993 --> 01:14:30,962
After years of waiting and hoping,
he's here, he's sick,

1012
01:14:31,030 --> 01:14:34,591
and he expects me to be with him,
whatever happened while he was away.

1013
01:14:34,667 --> 01:14:37,568
That's what I meant by trust. His kind of trust.

1014
01:14:45,811 --> 01:14:47,802
You know I love you.

1015
01:15:01,494 --> 01:15:05,453
- Right around the next corner, ain't it, Miss?
- Yes, I think so.

1016
01:15:16,142 --> 01:15:18,702
Stop here, driver.

1017
01:15:18,778 --> 01:15:20,905
Wait here, please.

1018
01:15:21,981 --> 01:15:24,142
John!

1019
01:15:26,585 --> 01:15:29,110
John!

1020
01:15:30,623 --> 01:15:33,217
John. Why didn't you wait?

1021
01:15:36,095 --> 01:15:38,655
They shouldn't have let you go, my darling.

1022
01:15:38,731 --> 01:15:40,722
They shouldn't have let you go.

1023
01:15:43,636 --> 01:15:46,264
I have a taxi. I'll take you home.

1024
01:15:46,338 --> 01:15:48,329
I love you so much, Val.

1025
01:15:51,510 --> 01:15:54,001
I'm going to take care of you, my darling.

1026
01:15:54,079 --> 01:15:56,070
I'll take you home.

1027
01:16:35,888 --> 01:16:39,324
Someday this army's
gonna do something the hard way.

1028
01:16:39,391 --> 01:16:41,916
Yeah, with a built-in cheering section.

1029
01:16:43,128 --> 01:16:46,154
All right, men. Up and over. On the double.

1030
01:16:46,232 --> 01:16:48,223
Get it done.

1031
01:16:50,502 --> 01:16:53,994
That's nice work, Parker. Darn nice work.

1032
01:16:54,072 --> 01:16:56,302
- Thank you, sir.
- Come on down here.

1033
01:16:58,677 --> 01:17:03,205
I always thought you had real stuff going.
Reporting for duty a week early proved it.

1034
01:17:03,281 --> 01:17:06,842
The problem was, could you stand it
physically? McEwan thinks you can.

1035
01:17:06,918 --> 01:17:09,785
- I can, sir.
- If I didn't think so, you wouldn't be here.

1036
01:17:09,855 --> 01:17:12,016
I like you, Brad. But not that much.

1037
01:17:12,090 --> 01:17:14,285
Well, I guess that buttons it up.

1038
01:17:14,426 --> 01:17:17,259
Dog Company is your baby from now on.
Take good care of it.

1039
01:17:17,329 --> 01:17:20,423
- Yes, sir.
- There'll be an officers' call at 0900.

1040
01:17:20,499 --> 01:17:24,401
You, Waller, Stenick, Parker
and your subordinates. See you.

1041
01:17:28,807 --> 01:17:32,766
Between where the British land
and the Americans land is a five-mile gap.

1042
01:17:32,844 --> 01:17:36,974
A gap of high ground.
Atop this high ground sits a 14-inch gun,

1043
01:17:37,048 --> 01:17:39,141
deeply embedded in the hillside,

1044
01:17:39,217 --> 01:17:43,847
which in turn is defended
by machine guns set in concrete pillboxes.

1045
01:17:43,922 --> 01:17:48,916
Now, this thing can't be assaulted
like regular beaches. It's on a 90-foot cliff.

1046
01:17:48,994 --> 01:17:51,428
It's got to be taken by a small force

1047
01:17:51,496 --> 01:17:54,624
just before the main landings
hit the beaches on either side,

1048
01:17:54,699 --> 01:17:57,668
in darkness, and by surprise.

1049
01:17:57,869 --> 01:18:01,361
Without surprise, there isn't
a chance of reaching that high ground.

1050
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:04,967
And gentlemen, no ifs and buts.

1051
01:18:05,043 --> 01:18:07,034
It's gotta be taken.

1052
01:18:07,112 --> 01:18:10,843
I needn't tell you that the force taking it is us.

1053
01:18:10,916 --> 01:18:16,320
So we go in before the naval bombardment
and a little ahead of the main body of ships.

1054
01:18:16,388 --> 01:18:18,481
Before H-hour, D-day.

1055
01:18:19,491 --> 01:18:21,482
How do you like it?

1056
01:18:25,597 --> 01:18:27,724
- Swig?
- I don't believe so, thanks.

1057
01:18:27,799 --> 01:18:30,700
Come on. Keep you warm.
It's not all coffee, you know.

1058
01:18:30,769 --> 01:18:32,760
No, thanks.

1059
01:18:37,609 --> 01:18:41,773
Between you and me, Brad, this Angel Point
isn't going to be too tough a nut to crack.

1060
01:18:41,847 --> 01:18:46,307
Ah, there'll be a lot of fireworks, sure,
and you're gonna hear a lot of noise.

1061
01:18:46,384 --> 01:18:49,217
That's what gets you down, Brad,
that lousy noise.

1062
01:18:49,287 --> 01:18:53,485
Ah, well, nobody ever got killed by noise,
did they, son, huh?

1063
01:18:53,558 --> 01:18:55,890
I don't guess they did, Colonel.

1064
01:18:55,961 --> 01:18:58,657
You can cut out
that "Colonel" stuff with me, Brad.

1065
01:18:58,730 --> 01:19:00,994
You know the name. Alex.

1066
01:19:01,867 --> 01:19:06,201
Well, noise or no noise, you're still
gonna have to give out with those orders.

1067
01:19:06,271 --> 01:19:08,466
Takes guts, boy, believe me.

1068
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:12,738
Ah, sure, there'll be
a lot of light stuff, I imagine.

1069
01:19:12,811 --> 01:19:14,904
Mostly machine guns and mortars.

1070
01:19:15,947 --> 01:19:20,475
What the heck. We'll find out what those
Intelligence johnnies have to say at noon.

1071
01:19:20,552 --> 01:19:22,543
Good of you to bring me along, sir.

1072
01:19:22,621 --> 01:19:25,852
I figured you could use
an hour or so in London afterwards.

1073
01:19:25,924 --> 01:19:27,915
<i>I know I can.</i>

1074
01:19:28,693 --> 01:19:31,662
Come on, have some. Calm you down.

1075
01:19:32,430 --> 01:19:34,421
Thanks.

1076
01:19:39,738 --> 01:19:41,968
Not too happy news, I'm afraid, sir.

1077
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:45,703
Our people in the area suspect
that old Jerry has thickened it up a bit,

1078
01:19:45,777 --> 01:19:48,974
moved some extra LMG platoons
into the signals thingumajig,

1079
01:19:49,047 --> 01:19:51,174
that's your able company objective.

1080
01:19:51,249 --> 01:19:54,184
I must say, it makes a sticky wicket, really.

1081
01:19:54,252 --> 01:19:57,187
Why can't the Air Force
knock it out with flying forts?

1082
01:19:57,255 --> 01:20:02,887
A series of heavy-bomber raids of sufficient
concentration would be a dead giveaway,

1083
01:20:02,961 --> 01:20:05,122
even if they did knock out your gun.

1084
01:20:05,931 --> 01:20:10,493
I confess that the mere fact that you
should ask such a question at this stage...

1085
01:20:10,569 --> 01:20:13,231
I find it highly disquieting. Highly so.

1086
01:20:14,673 --> 01:20:17,904
Forget it. What about mines?

1087
01:20:17,976 --> 01:20:21,810
We'll get the word about mines
probably a day or so before you go in.

1088
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:26,544
- Well, that's it. Good luck, sir.
- Thank you, Major.

1089
01:20:26,618 --> 01:20:29,280
- Good luck, Captain Parker.
- Thank you, sir.

1090
01:20:30,922 --> 01:20:32,913
Meet me back here after...

1091
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:35,549
No, I'll tell you what. Let's see.

1092
01:20:35,627 --> 01:20:37,925
Meet me here at 2100 sharp.

1093
01:20:37,996 --> 01:20:42,194
I think I'll run up to that club of mine
for a while, maybe find old Dunc Harkness.

1094
01:20:42,267 --> 01:20:44,792
- Do you remember him? Dieppe?
- Yes, sir.

1095
01:20:46,071 --> 01:20:48,062
See you.

1096
01:20:55,213 --> 01:20:59,081
<i>This guy comes into the Colonel's
office. He doesn't look 20 years old.</i>

1097
01:20:59,150 --> 01:21:03,348
When the Colonel starts bawling him out,
he unzips his jacket. He's a one-star general!

1098
01:21:04,489 --> 01:21:07,458
Boy, you should have seen
the Colonel's face.

1099
01:21:13,999 --> 01:21:16,467
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1100
01:21:16,534 --> 01:21:18,525
- Brad!
- Valerie.

1101
01:21:21,806 --> 01:21:25,139
Oh, you look wonderful, darling.
You look beautiful.

1102
01:21:25,210 --> 01:21:29,579
Brad, I'm so glad you're here.
I was hoping to... I've been wanting to...

1103
01:21:29,648 --> 01:21:32,981
Look, I haven't got so very long.
Couldn't we go somewhere else?

1104
01:21:33,051 --> 01:21:35,519
I'm the only one here right now, but...

1105
01:21:35,587 --> 01:21:39,045
Maybe just for a few minutes.
We can go to that awful tea shop.

1106
01:21:39,124 --> 01:21:42,025
- At least it's quiet and we can talk.
- Let's go.

1107
01:21:47,465 --> 01:21:49,933
Oh, thank you very much, sir. Thank you.

1108
01:21:58,610 --> 01:22:00,635
Ought to be stronger than that.

1109
01:22:00,712 --> 01:22:03,112
- Who taught you?
- You did.

1110
01:22:05,784 --> 01:22:10,847
Well, when you're away from someone, you
start to see their face so many different ways.

1111
01:22:10,922 --> 01:22:13,220
Just all kinds of different ways.

1112
01:22:13,291 --> 01:22:15,851
I know. I know so well.

1113
01:22:15,927 --> 01:22:19,363
Down at the camp, sometimes,
I used to sort of try to kid myself.

1114
01:22:19,431 --> 01:22:21,558
You know, just see how I felt.

1115
01:22:21,633 --> 01:22:27,037
I'd say "Maybe five years from now
I won't even remember the color of her eyes."

1116
01:22:27,105 --> 01:22:29,096
Won't you, Brad?

1117
01:22:29,174 --> 01:22:34,043
As soon as I'd say that, I'd know that
I could never forget, not as long as I live.

1118
01:22:37,315 --> 01:22:42,480
Well, Valerie, pretty soon,
with any luck, the war'll be over,

1119
01:22:43,822 --> 01:22:46,518
and we've got to be thinking about that.

1120
01:22:47,892 --> 01:22:50,190
I never can give you up. I never will.

1121
01:22:54,966 --> 01:22:56,957
I'm going to be with John, Brad.

1122
01:22:58,369 --> 01:23:01,827
Oh, sure, I know. He's sick. He needs you.

1123
01:23:03,308 --> 01:23:05,299
He's quite well now, Brad.

1124
01:23:06,711 --> 01:23:08,702
I mean, for always.

1125
01:23:10,148 --> 01:23:12,139
It's just as simple as that.

1126
01:23:13,685 --> 01:23:16,017
You see, he's been waiting for me.

1127
01:23:16,087 --> 01:23:19,079
That's all he's been waiting for, for two years.

1128
01:23:20,091 --> 01:23:22,082
I never lied to him about us.

1129
01:23:26,064 --> 01:23:30,023
I remember when you used
to tell me about your wife, before we...

1130
01:23:32,871 --> 01:23:35,169
You go home, Brad, and you'll be glad.

1131
01:23:35,974 --> 01:23:37,965
I know you will.

1132
01:23:39,577 --> 01:23:43,308
Valerie, I've come to admire so much.

1133
01:23:43,381 --> 01:23:46,077
- The things you people stand for.
- It's not...

1134
01:23:46,151 --> 01:23:50,713
But if I could only believe
this is really the way you want it...

1135
01:23:50,789 --> 01:23:52,780
You, my darling, not him.

1136
01:23:52,857 --> 01:23:55,917
It is difficult to believe?
He's a wonderful man.

1137
01:23:58,229 --> 01:24:04,634
You're beautiful, Valerie.
I... I listen to you, and I watch your face,

1138
01:24:04,702 --> 01:24:09,139
and I know what you're saying,
but your eyes keep me from believing it.

1139
01:24:09,207 --> 01:24:11,869
- I never could.
- You will.

1140
01:24:14,546 --> 01:24:17,140
We're closing now, sir. Sorry.

1141
01:24:17,215 --> 01:24:20,241
That'll be two and ninepence, please.

1142
01:24:20,318 --> 01:24:23,810
I love you. I'll come back.

1143
01:24:23,888 --> 01:24:26,288
- No.
- Oh, but I will. I swear it.

1144
01:24:27,358 --> 01:24:29,349
I'm never going to give you up.

1145
01:24:41,005 --> 01:24:42,996
Thank you, sir.

1146
01:25:04,963 --> 01:25:07,955
Here you are, Captain Parker.
Been looking for you all over.

1147
01:25:08,032 --> 01:25:10,023
- Come with me, please.
- What's up?

1148
01:25:10,101 --> 01:25:11,466
You'll find out.

1149
01:25:18,409 --> 01:25:21,435
- OK, what is it?
- Sorry to get you down here, Bolthouse.

1150
01:25:21,512 --> 01:25:24,913
- It's been plain murder. It's Special Force Six.
- What about it?

1151
01:25:24,983 --> 01:25:28,680
Its commanding officer, Timmer,
was picked up by British police tonight

1152
01:25:28,753 --> 01:25:34,089
in a doorway in the Strand, talking to
a large street audience about the operation.

1153
01:25:34,158 --> 01:25:37,719
- What did he say?
- It was all pretty incoherent.

1154
01:25:37,795 --> 01:25:41,458
It seems he's been under heavy
mental stress and tonight he lost control.

1155
01:25:41,532 --> 01:25:44,194
It's a shocker.
He's got British under his command.

1156
01:25:44,269 --> 01:25:46,260
Well, what did he say?

1157
01:25:46,337 --> 01:25:49,636
This is the report
of the constable who picked him up.

1158
01:25:51,943 --> 01:25:56,846
"He spoke in my presence the following:
See the gap? Sticks out like a sore thumb."

1159
01:25:56,915 --> 01:25:59,315
"Smack between Gold Beach and Omaha."

1160
01:25:59,384 --> 01:26:04,185
"The Krauts have thickened it up a bit. Angel
Point, where we go in..." That's a good one.

1161
01:26:04,255 --> 01:26:09,625
Angel Point. Angel is right.
And all this before a crowd.

1162
01:26:09,694 --> 01:26:11,685
- Is that right?
- Yes, sir.

1163
01:26:11,763 --> 01:26:15,392
- What did you do with him?
- Put him in a psycho ward for observation.

1164
01:26:15,466 --> 01:26:17,900
- It's all you can do.
- The devil with Timmer.

1165
01:26:17,969 --> 01:26:21,928
What about the special force? They go
to the marshaling areas tomorrow night.

1166
01:26:22,006 --> 01:26:24,531
If we go by the book?
Second-in-command takes over?

1167
01:26:24,609 --> 01:26:26,839
Stenick and everybody else
move up a notch?

1168
01:26:26,911 --> 01:26:31,109
We can't take Stenick out of Able Company.
That's the heart of the operation.

1169
01:26:31,182 --> 01:26:36,017
Let's get a new guy that's had a few landings.
He can run the show from the beach.

1170
01:26:36,087 --> 01:26:41,787
Our personnel people should be
just about comfortably asleep by now.

1171
01:26:41,859 --> 01:26:44,919
- Let's get 'em up, get 'em over here.
- By the way, sir.

1172
01:26:44,996 --> 01:26:48,830
- Parker came down with Colonel Timmer.
- Captain, how're you divided up?

1173
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:51,926
- Third Canadian, third US, third British?
- Exactly, sir.

1174
01:26:52,003 --> 01:26:56,133
Then it's a tossup. One of your boys
or one of ours, it doesn't make any difference.

1175
01:26:56,207 --> 01:27:00,974
Captain, go back and tell them that Colonel
Timmer was stricken with appendicitis.

1176
01:27:01,045 --> 01:27:03,104
- Acute appendicitis.
- Yes, sir.

1177
01:27:09,854 --> 01:27:11,845
Gentlemen.

1178
01:27:15,927 --> 01:27:17,918
Sit down, gentlemen.

1179
01:27:17,996 --> 01:27:22,057
Tighten your seat belts. We're gonna
hear about the Charge of the Light Brigade.

1180
01:27:22,133 --> 01:27:26,695
Well, my name's Wynter and I've been
ordered to take command of this operation.

1181
01:27:26,771 --> 01:27:30,502
I thought Major Stenick or Major McEwan
would be appointed to the command.

1182
01:27:30,575 --> 01:27:32,634
I feel it's wrong that one of them wasn't.

1183
01:27:32,710 --> 01:27:35,975
But of course, I'll do my best,
as I'm sure you will.

1184
01:27:36,047 --> 01:27:39,312
As for myself, I'm delighted
to be going into action again,

1185
01:27:39,384 --> 01:27:41,443
especially with so fine a force.

1186
01:27:41,519 --> 01:27:45,888
We've got a nice, clear-cut operation ahead,
plenty of fighting but nothing complex.

1187
01:27:46,924 --> 01:27:49,950
You won't be seeing much of me
till we board the ships,

1188
01:27:50,028 --> 01:27:52,792
because I've got
a bit of catching up to do.

1189
01:27:52,864 --> 01:27:55,594
Please feel free to barge in on me at any time.

1190
01:27:56,667 --> 01:28:00,194
- Now, why don't you introduce me?
- Certainly.

1191
01:28:00,271 --> 01:28:02,831
- Major Stenick, sir.
- Major Stenick.

1192
01:28:02,907 --> 01:28:05,171
Colonel.

1193
01:28:05,243 --> 01:28:07,234
Captain Parker, sir.

1194
01:28:08,112 --> 01:28:10,637
- Uh... Captain Brad Parker?
- Yes, sir.

1195
01:28:12,517 --> 01:28:14,678
- And Major McEwan.
- How do you do?

1196
01:28:14,752 --> 01:28:16,743
How do you do, sir?

1197
01:28:21,192 --> 01:28:27,359
<i>Attention all personnel of Special Force Six.</i>

1198
01:28:27,432 --> 01:28:30,993
<i>Landing crafts will be
lowered away in seven minutes.</i>

1199
01:30:01,758 --> 01:30:04,625
<i>Stellung nehmen.</i>

1200
01:30:06,562 --> 01:30:08,553
<i>Volle Gefechtsbereitschaft.</i>

1201
01:30:52,575 --> 01:30:55,009
<i>Feuer!</i>

1202
01:31:42,325 --> 01:31:44,316
Brooks!

1203
01:31:46,729 --> 01:31:48,754
- Sir?
- Locate Colonel Wynter.

1204
01:31:48,831 --> 01:31:52,995
Tell him we're pinned down and can't
move without heavy losses. What orders?

1205
01:31:53,069 --> 01:31:54,593
Yes, sir.

1206
01:32:13,222 --> 01:32:18,023
Sir! Sir. Captain Parker's pinned down.
What are your orders?

1207
01:32:18,094 --> 01:32:20,324
Sergeant, keep cover. I'll be back.

1208
01:32:21,831 --> 01:32:23,822
<i>Uh!</i>

1209
01:32:35,478 --> 01:32:38,572
I'm gonna try moving up
on the ridge on the left flank there.

1210
01:32:38,648 --> 01:32:41,048
I might get a crack at the gun
before they see me.

1211
01:32:41,117 --> 01:32:45,281
- But you'll be under direct fire, sir.
- Keep up the pressure on that pillbox.

1212
01:32:45,354 --> 01:32:49,757
Then it's up to you to get those mortars
on the right flank, at all costs.

1213
01:32:55,398 --> 01:32:57,389
Hennessy! Clark!

1214
01:33:17,420 --> 01:33:20,321
All right, Hennessy.
Roll it right down the middle.

1215
01:33:47,550 --> 01:33:49,541
All right, let's go.

1216
01:34:23,919 --> 01:34:26,285
Corporal, your section follow me.

1217
01:34:26,355 --> 01:34:28,516
Sergeant, covering fire. Come on!

1218
01:35:04,460 --> 01:35:06,860
You four, right flanking. Grenades.

1219
01:35:06,929 --> 01:35:09,921
Lob them in the gun embrasures.
We'll cover you.

1220
01:35:24,780 --> 01:35:26,771
Fire on my command.

1221
01:35:33,823 --> 01:35:35,814
Now!

1222
01:36:47,096 --> 01:36:51,192
- OK, Captain. You've had your war.
- Is it all over up here?

1223
01:36:51,267 --> 01:36:54,998
Yep. They just sent up
some PFCs to police up the grounds.

1224
01:36:55,871 --> 01:36:58,032
- How's Major Stenick?
- He's dead.

1225
01:36:59,475 --> 01:37:01,466
Dan... dead?

1226
01:37:01,544 --> 01:37:04,809
Major McEwan and Captain Waller
never got touched, though.

1227
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:08,077
Now, I'm gonna give you a nice little shot,

1228
01:37:08,150 --> 01:37:12,018
and before you know it,
you'll be back across the Channel.

1229
01:37:12,087 --> 01:37:14,180
And then, bingo! Home.

1230
01:37:14,924 --> 01:37:19,054
- Home, huh?
- That's it, Captain. The good old USA.

1231
01:37:20,129 --> 01:37:22,597
Colonel Wynter. How's Colonel Wynter?

1232
01:37:23,499 --> 01:37:26,024
He was hit in the arm. Not too bad, though.

1233
01:37:26,936 --> 01:37:29,837
I think he was up here
walking around a few minutes ago.

1234
01:37:29,905 --> 01:37:33,238
- But he's had his war, too.
- Thank God for that.

1235
01:37:33,976 --> 01:37:36,467
<i>OK, boys. Vorwärts marsch.</i>

1236
01:37:51,826 --> 01:37:53,817
<i>Einen Moment.</i>

1237
01:38:01,369 --> 01:38:04,099
Good work, Parker. Darn good work.

1238
01:38:05,139 --> 01:38:08,108
- Thank you, sir.
- You feeling any better?

1239
01:38:08,176 --> 01:38:10,576
Yeah. Thanks, Colonel Wynter.

1240
01:38:10,645 --> 01:38:12,772
<i>Feel a lot...</i>

1241
01:38:12,847 --> 01:38:14,838
better now.

1242
01:38:14,916 --> 01:38:16,975
There's no use saying too much now, Brad.

1243
01:38:18,286 --> 01:38:21,346
Let it wait.
You'll have all the time in the world.

1244
01:38:23,524 --> 01:38:26,891
Well, they'll have you
back in England for lunchtime.

1245
01:38:27,795 --> 01:38:30,923
They'll probably
clear me out of here in a bit, too.

1246
01:38:33,201 --> 01:38:36,432
- Good luck.
- Good luck to you, sir.

1247
01:38:44,278 --> 01:38:46,269
Do what you can for him.

1248
01:39:11,806 --> 01:39:13,797
Watch it, Colonel.

1249
01:39:13,875 --> 01:39:16,070
We haven't checked that area yet.

1250
01:39:59,287 --> 01:40:01,278
Cigarette, Captain?

1251
01:40:07,128 --> 01:40:09,221
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

1252
01:40:09,297 --> 01:40:12,130
- Hey, could you do me a favor?
- Sure.

1253
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:15,135
Telephone Miss Russell
at the Red Cross in Mayfair...

1254
01:40:15,203 --> 01:40:18,468
Sorry, Captain,
we're sealed off from London completely.

1255
01:40:18,539 --> 01:40:21,235
- How long?
- Goodness knows. Days, anyway.

1256
01:40:24,445 --> 01:40:27,209
One of our girls
is going into London tomorrow.

1257
01:40:27,281 --> 01:40:29,476
I could risk my neck and ask her.

1258
01:40:30,351 --> 01:40:32,342
Risk it.

1259
01:40:32,420 --> 01:40:34,411
What's the message, Captain?

1260
01:40:35,790 --> 01:40:40,124
Tell her I got
roughed up a little but I'm OK.

1261
01:40:41,729 --> 01:40:43,959
Same thing goes for Colonel Wynter.

1262
01:40:45,633 --> 01:40:50,195
As soon as I know what hospital
I'm in I'll get in touch with her.

1263
01:40:54,142 --> 01:40:57,134
Is there absolutely nothing I can do?

1264
01:40:58,246 --> 01:41:00,237
Are you sure?

1265
01:41:01,182 --> 01:41:04,379
I hated having to be the one
to come and tell you this.

1266
01:41:05,386 --> 01:41:08,651
General Frye wanted me
to break the news about John

1267
01:41:09,924 --> 01:41:12,449
before you heard about it accidentally.

1268
01:41:13,728 --> 01:41:16,094
I'm terribly, terribly sorry.

1269
01:41:19,167 --> 01:41:21,158
Are you sure there's nothing?

1270
01:41:24,372 --> 01:41:26,363
Then I think I'll say good night.

1271
01:41:27,241 --> 01:41:29,232
Thank you, David.

1272
01:41:30,444 --> 01:41:32,435
Bless you, darling.

1273
01:41:50,131 --> 01:41:53,191
Hello? Yes, this is Miss Russell.

1274
01:41:54,669 --> 01:41:56,660
Yes, go ahead.

1275
01:42:02,176 --> 01:42:04,576
In here, Miss Russell. Right down there.

1276
01:42:04,645 --> 01:42:06,636
Thank you.

1277
01:42:17,158 --> 01:42:19,149
Brad?

1278
01:42:20,194 --> 01:42:22,185
Brad.

1279
01:42:25,566 --> 01:42:27,557
You got my message?

1280
01:42:29,804 --> 01:42:31,795
They're shipping you home.

1281
01:42:39,413 --> 01:42:41,404
You know, that last day I saw you...

1282
01:42:43,317 --> 01:42:47,344
It's such a little while ago,
and so much has happened.

1283
01:42:47,421 --> 01:42:51,858
You said "You'll go back. You'll be happy to."

1284
01:42:54,061 --> 01:42:57,792
Itjust seemed like
the last thing in the world I'd ever want.

1285
01:42:58,699 --> 01:43:03,136
And then the other morning,
on the beach there, Normandy,

1286
01:43:03,204 --> 01:43:05,968
when the medic told me I'd be shipping back,

1287
01:43:06,040 --> 01:43:11,307
I suddenly thought
"Valerie was right. She knew."

1288
01:43:12,680 --> 01:43:15,649
And after a bit, John was standing there.

1289
01:43:15,716 --> 01:43:19,083
You know,
just standing there talking, nothing much.

1290
01:43:19,253 --> 01:43:24,020
And it all seemed so simple,
just like you said it was, and clear,

1291
01:43:25,026 --> 01:43:27,017
and the future seemed very real.

1292
01:43:32,533 --> 01:43:34,524
I'll always love you, Brad.

1293
01:43:34,869 --> 01:43:39,670
And I'll always be grateful to you
for whatever happens in my life.

1294
01:43:39,740 --> 01:43:43,039
You'll be happy, too,
you and John. I know you will.

1295
01:43:43,110 --> 01:43:45,101
Yes.

1296
01:43:45,179 --> 01:43:49,138
Incidentally, he's a...
he's a pretty terrific guy, that John.

1297
01:43:50,051 --> 01:43:52,645
A pretty wonderful guy.

1298
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:54,711
How is he?

1299
01:43:55,623 --> 01:43:57,716
Oh, he's still pretty wonderful.

1300
01:43:59,493 --> 01:44:01,586
You haven't seen him the way we did.

1301
01:44:01,662 --> 01:44:03,653
<i>Shut up, Brad! Shut up!</i>

1302
01:44:04,899 --> 01:44:06,890
Don't cry.

1303
01:44:09,236 --> 01:44:11,466
I was right about one thing, though.

1304
01:44:13,307 --> 01:44:16,140
I always will remember
the color of your eyes.

1305
01:44:22,683 --> 01:44:26,915
Afraid I have to break up this little gathering.
It's time to change bandages.

1306
01:44:26,987 --> 01:44:28,978
Please, Doc, let her stay.

1307
01:44:29,056 --> 01:44:34,358
Now, look. We've already given you a break
by letting this young lady in to start with.

1308
01:44:36,764 --> 01:44:39,961
Goodbye, Brad, my only, only...

1309
01:44:40,034 --> 01:44:42,025
Goodbye, my darling.

1310
01:44:49,377 --> 01:44:51,368
Thank you, doctor.
