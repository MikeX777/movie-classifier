1
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,993
No Big Deal

2
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,991
Really disappointed.

3
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,991
Hey.

4
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,991
Damn.

5
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What happened? on the road.

6
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,991
Such a dog ass day.

7
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,991
The paying time has already passed.

8
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,991
So go to hell.

9
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
What's wrong?

10
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,991
You sure are going to die.

11
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,991
Come on, get on the car.

12
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You are performing for kids now?

13
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Right, we do everything.

14
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I got out at the break.

15
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Even Shakespeare was a a walk-on before he's famous.

16
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yes, and now you are either.

17
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,991
Can't make it.

18
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Morning, morning

19
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Who's he? My brother Charlie

20
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's real.

21
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,991
Is it colorful?

22
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,991
It always like that.

23
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,991
People already get used to it.

24
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Max, look at that juggler.

25
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
We got all those stuff, right?

26
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yes, and should we start? Alright.

27
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,993
Ok, I see, now let's begin.

28
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Take it.

29
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,993
We deserve it, for our dubbing.

30
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You go that way?

31
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I thinks so, I gotta pick him up.

32
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,991
See, Leo.

33
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What have him told you?

34
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Hey, Leo. What?

35
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What did Pilar tell you?

36
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Not very clear.

37
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
But I know his illness had gone more serious.

38
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Gotta see him at once.

39
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Also he told me about the cross which Jesus was nailed on.

40
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And the Virgin Mary, something like that.

41
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,993
The Cross? We should hurry up.

42
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
How long is it since you last time saw him.

43
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
No idea, maybe 6 months.

44
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And you?

45
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The same, you?

46
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Why so many questions? Are you policemen?

47
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Well, in your opinion, should we come inside?

48
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,991
Do it.

49
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I say no one wants to look at it again.

50
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Yes, I can feel it.

51
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm wondering where he found these things?

52
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,993
I think, these were always in his head.

53
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,991
Come look at this.

54
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
He is really someone, can do anything.

55
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,993
He used this for what? But not bad indeed.

56
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,991
Such a miracle.

57
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,991
Hard to believe?

58
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
He walked from Saintt Mass to Saint Piere.

59
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Since his first sickness.

60
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
At the very beginning, I even hadn't notice that.

61
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
He didn't wanna talk about it, or I could worry a lot about him.

62
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
He alwasy saying hi's fine.

63
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
But I knew it's not true.

64
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
First, he brought some big stuffs back.

65
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,991
Some priest's things.

66
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
One morning, he locked himself in the room.

67
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Just lain on bed for a week.

68
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So It was messed up.

69
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Is he ok?

70
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,991
He slept all day.

71
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,991
Doc says it's very normal.

72
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Ok, go, he's waitting for you.

73
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,991
Go, go.

74
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,991
Pablo.

75
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,991
Alright?

76
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I don't know if she's still there.

77
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,991
I don't know.

78
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The statuary you are looking for, what does it like?

79
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,991
She's pretty.

80
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,991
I know.

81
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You must think about, I got something wrong.

82
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's not like that.

83
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You'v adopted us for 25 years, we can understand.

84
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,993
But this time, I'll count on you.

85
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,991
Will you?

86
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I can only count on you now.

87
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,991
Don't worry.

88
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Why suddenly talk about statuary?

89
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
We'v known him for 40 years, and he never talk about it.

90
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I thought he'd forgotton it for a long time.

91
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
But where had he heard from?

92
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
He is old now.

93
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Like anyone else, he couldn't help recalling some past.

94
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
But that statuary he said.

95
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Could be stolen long ago.

96
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,993
He ask us to find, is him crazy?

97
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
He brought you home when you were 6 years old.

98
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
In these 26 years.

99
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
He treat you like his own son.

100
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
He never asks you to be good, be smart.

101
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I don't know why.

102
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
He loves you, that's all.

103
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
That Tuesday. Rainning.

104
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,991
The first thing he did.

105
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Was buying you new boots.

106
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You are the most important thing in his life.

107
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
We didn't get one franc then.

108
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And no house.

109
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
No even piano.

110
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It it crazy?

111
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
We know no one there.

112
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,993
We'v never been Spain, strange people, strange country, and can't say the language.

113
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,991
Statuary of the Virgin Mary.

114
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
An old man wants us to go to Spain.

115
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,991
Get the Virgin Mary back.

116
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Just like Stalin order his followings.

117
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
To take one piece land of Africa back.

118
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I won't go.

119
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
She's right, he wants that statuary.

120
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Then you go, we don't know anybody there.

121
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Except he goes by himself.

122
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And he should be healthy.

123
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Ok, keep thinking for yourself.

124
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
No, I'm thinking for you.

125
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And for you too.

126
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You two want to just watch?

127
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Making money like hell.

128
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Then cast it out like hell either.

129
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's so crazy.

130
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's the same reason.

131
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'll be crazy if i go to Spain.

132
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Think about it, think it over.

133
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,991
You are wrong.

134
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Charlie, you have money?

135
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Some for my coffin.

136
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But nor much

137
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Nothing else?

138
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Yes, I lent some to a friend.

139
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
But I think he'd already spent it out.

140
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,993
Then we should make your friend to do a smarter financing.

141
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Hey, Charlie my brother

142
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Are you ok?

143
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Of course, but his brother is me.

144
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,993
We are on a vacation.

145
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
The money you borrowed from me.

146
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm asking if you can..

147
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
listen Charlie, I have money.

148
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
But short fo it.

149
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm so sorry.

150
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I have a little brother just about to go to school.

151
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I have to give him some money.

152
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
A brand new car.

153
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yes.

154
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
So pretty, must be dear.

155
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Yes, but It's divided payments.

156
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
That'll be much better, you can send it back if broken.

157
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Never realize it's so slimsy, so bad.

158
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
What are you doing!

159
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Let me see the motor if it works.

160
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Seems ok, then the glove.

161
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
No, stop, I say stop!

162
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
There's some money in my home.

163
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'll give it to you, but don't touch my car.

164
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You should have told me earlier.

165
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
How?

166
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
This way.

167
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,991
I follow you.

168
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It's ok, mon.

169
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Good morning, madam.

170
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm a revenuer.

171
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,993
He's really something.

172
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
In the name of the father.

173
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,991
Look at this stupid hard cheese.

174
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Damn, Damn it.

175
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
My car!

176
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'll kill you, Charlie.

177
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,991
I'll kill you.

178
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Why do you get all your stuff on the car?

179
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'v never been without this car.

180
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,993
But we'll get in trouble in the border checking.

181
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It makes sense.

182
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
There're everything.

183
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
But they won't get me in trouble.

184
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Won't

185
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Yes, Max.

186
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You always can play to the score, every time.

187
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Indeed.

188
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I never worry about it.

189
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,991
I can go by myself.

190
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,993
But the problem is Pablo wants us three go together.

191
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,993
Obviously, Two heads are better than one.

192
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
One week, not even one day more, ok?

193
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,991
Ok, only if you go.

194
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,991
I love this song.

195
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Good morning, gentlemen.

196
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
May I have a look at your Driver license?

197
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,991
Of course.

198
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Have we done something wrong?

199
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Just want you to know there're speed limits.

200
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,991
Alright.

201
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
What's in the car?

202
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Nothing speciall.

203
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,991
Ok, let's see.

204
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
What does it like where we're heading to?

205
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Must be a outter small town.

206
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
We could have a look at the tour service.

207
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Or some place like that.

208
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,993
I think the local product there is tangerine.

209
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You were right.

210
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
We should go to the tour service.

211
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Ok, how to find it?

212
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Where should we meet? A bar

213
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,993
I got address, see if we can find it.

214
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Look, there're many people.

215
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
They havn't seen each other since the civil war was over.

216
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
That should be 50 years.

217
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
He's supposed to be very old.

218
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Couldn't recognize hime easily.

219
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Agree, it's such a elder club here.

220
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,991
I think, might be him.

221
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
To me, might be a lot of people.

222
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Do you send by Mr Pablo?

223
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,993
Yes, we are his sons.

224
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Very good, Gabo is waitting for you.

225
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Oh?

226
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You have a appointment, I have to drive you there.

227
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,993
Can we go now?

228
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,991
See you.

229
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It was you who slapped my butt?

230
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Not that hard.

231
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Every time where I see a beauty.

232
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,993
I couldn't help touching it.

233
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It's a kind of conditioned reflex.

234
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Correct.

235
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,991
Conditioned reflex

236
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Sorry

237
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Conditioned reflex

238
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
So

239
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,993
It can't be controlled.

240
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Have you ever learned that?

241
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,991
You mean this kind of hitting?

242
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You can't imagine that I did something like that, right?

243
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Gabo told me about it.

244
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
There have to be actual combat, or it's useless.

245
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
You often do this?

246
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
No, first time.

247
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
But it's very nice.

248
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Hope it wouldn't be rude.

249
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
What are Gabo doing now?

250
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Nothing, He's old.

251
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,991
He lives there.

252
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Tell me something about Pablo.

253
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
He's old too, right?

254
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Yes, old.

255
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,993
His hair, still that much?

256
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Very good.

257
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
He gots a lot of pain?

258
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
There're some illness, but no big deal.

259
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I don't care about this.

260
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,993
I'm interested about what's wrong in his heart.

261
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm sure he has other pain.

262
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,993
Dose he have prostate?

263
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Yes, of course.

264
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It makes me pain.

265
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I thought he'd already cut it off.

266
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,993
Or at least I live a better life to him.

267
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Or he looks older than me.

268
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Pablo is full of energy.

269
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
He's very polite, and don't have to sit in wheelchair.

270
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
He could enjoy the sunshine everyday.

271
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,993
He's dying, so we are here.

272
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Where do you sleep at night?

273
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
We'v just arrived, no time for finding a hotel.

274
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Angela will help you out.

275
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
She knows every people here.

276
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
See you tomorrow, then we keep talking.

277
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Your father always likes that?

278
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Yes, what?

279
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,991
No, nothing.

280
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Gabo can't admit that he couldn't walk anymore.

281
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Since he got apoplexy last year, he'v never left the room.

282
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
But he's really a vivid man before that.

283
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
He loves his friends.

284
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Pablo is his best friend.

285
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
He ofther talks about Pablo?

286
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Yes, a lot.

287
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
That's why I want to see you.

288
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,993
See what's the differences between us.

289
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Right, that's it.

290
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,991
Coffee plus milk.

291
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,991
Milk?

292
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Milk from milch cow, Milk.

293
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I get it, [spanish]

294
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Yes

295
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Want a tallow cake?

296
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,991
What?

297
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Cake with tallow on it.

298
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,991
and jam.

299
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
en?

300
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
confiture, jam.

301
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Oh, jam

302
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Yes jam

303
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I can't understand any words

304
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I just know 3 spanish words.

305
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
If we don't speak spanish,

306
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Then whatever he say is right.

307
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Nice explanation, thanks.

308
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Tell him we don't get much time.

309
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
You think we came here for fun?

310
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,993
Calm down, it's just the beginning.

311
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,991
I didn't mean to camplain.

312
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Are you talking about us?

313
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
He told me there're some Frenchmen.

314
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,993
Even can't speak coffee plus milk.

315
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I think you are the frenchmen.

316
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
It can't be.

317
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
He's very funny.

318
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
What did you just call him?

319
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
His name is Andre

320
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
But you can also calll him Manolete

321
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
It's a long long story.

322
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Then tell us.

323
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,993
Next time, I gotta go, Gabo is waitting for us.

324
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Have a good day.

325
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,991
Welcome to Spain.

326
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,993
We'll stay here for minutes.

327
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
We know this old man, don't we?

328
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
If Pablo's here, he'll be interested in it.

329
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,991
He's Miguel.

330
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Are you really sons of Pablo?

331
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,991
Yes, real.

332
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Then you tell him when you back, Migalrido

333
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Never forget him.

334
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Migalrido?

335
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Last time I saw him is in Sep.

336
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
He don't have many days to live.

337
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And he always thinks about the past.

338
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,991
Although it's long ago.

339
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,991
He can't forget it.

340
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,993
As he's at the battlefront.

341
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,993
you tell Gabo, she's at Casanis.

342
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
That's 27th Oct.

343
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,993
We had a position there.

344
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,993
We took part in the local army.

345
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,993
Once a night, we came to a villiage.

346
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Have to kill all the people.

347
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
There're no amry at all.

348
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,993
Just old ones, women and kids.

349
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,993
I thought Pablo couldn't stand it.

350
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
At Casaniss.

351
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
There's a purple statuary of the Virgin Mary.

352
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
That time.

353
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
We had no choice.

354
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
He stayed there all day.

355
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,991
Without a move.

356
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,991
Just pray.

357
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
We got the bad news.

358
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,991
Every one's died.

359
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
It's a heavy strike.

360
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Two months later.

361
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Pablo went to France.

362
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,993
From then on, never come back.

363
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,993
In that times, we can not help doing that.

364
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
You'v never seen each other since then?

365
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
No, we kept in touch at the very beginning.

366
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,991
But terminated later.

367
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
But Pablo, he's always in here.

368
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
So that's what we're looking for?

369
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Yes, Casaniss.

370
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
In the military area.

371
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,991
Who are we supposed to meet?

372
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Be patient, he'll be here soon.

373
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,991
Listen, she's coming.

374
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,993
She's who we want to see.

375
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Is she great?

376
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,991
Yes,she is.

377
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
You got girlfriends in France?

378
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,991
Yes, some.

379
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I spoke for you.

380
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
We think it's really crazy.

381
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
You? got boyfriend? or alone.

382
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
No, for now, I'm too busy.

383
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
What do you do?

384
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I'm working in hospital.

385
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
chief?

386
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
No, doctor.

387
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Yes?

388
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Yes.

389
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I can do surgery.

390
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,993
Like cut someone's bingy open.

391
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,993
And you? What do you do?

392
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,991
We were artists once.

393
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
But our father is infatuated with the Virgin Mary.

394
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
We got no choice but to come here.

395
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
What do you think about us?

396
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I think you are adopted.

397
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Yes.

398
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Good evening, gentlemen.

399
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,993
I'm a policeman, can I have a look at your ID?

400
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
This is our captain.

401
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Nice to meet you.

402
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Your performence was wonderful.

403
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I like your new song.

404
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
It's always in fashion.

405
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
But show a different meaning, right?

406
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
It was you who just singing?

407
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
You don't like it?

408
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I like it, very much.

409
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
It's just, just we don't know.

410
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
You couldn't imagine a captain singing like this, right?

411
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
A captain should only sit here eating and drinking, right?

412
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,991
Yes.

413
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,993
Then this time I make your friends' eyes open.

414
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,991
Oh my God.

415
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Not very complicated.

416
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
See that colonel?

417
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
We should ask him

418
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Pablo wants his statuary back.

419
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
If he says no, then we talk about another way.

420
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
He sure won't give it to us.

421
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
When should we get to Angela?

422
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
She never told, she got work to do today.

423
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,993
A army car, japanese car.

424
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,993
Let's go to find her.

425
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
See what's she doing now.

426
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
You want to see her doing operation?

427
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,993
No, but...

428
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Are you looking for Angela?

429
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Yes

430
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
She asked me to tell you she's in operation.

431
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
But if you want to.

432
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
You can join the later part.

433
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
It's about to over.

434
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Come. follow me.

435
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,991
Will you come?

436
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,993
Have you ever seen a operation?

437
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
If not, now it's your chance.

438
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,991
Close to us.

439
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,991
Nice work?

440
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
It's your first time.

441
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
So fell in a faint.

442
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Tomorrow, I'll get some invitaion card.

443
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
If you want to, you can come with me.

444
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Well, what's your search going on?

445
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Some guards at the door.

446
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
And some cars.

447
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Many strong men were running inside.

448
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Now the question is how we can get into it.

449
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,993
sneak through or get a dog to do the search.

450
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,993
One word, we gotta find a way in.

451
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
There have to be some leaks.

452
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Even it's military area.

453
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Why did you get in the army?

454
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I'v asked the same question either.

455
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
But to be a son have no right to ask his father this question.

456
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
We should think it over.

457
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Find a easiest way.

458
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Flawless.

459
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
What's your job?

460
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I do investigation.

461
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
You are a cop too?

462
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
No... I just collect and stat the reports.

463
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
See if they are doing legal business

464
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
something like that.

465
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
You like your job?

466
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
No

467
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Who?

468
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
a gifed musician, died in his 26.

469
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,991
Wait

470
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Someone should go for a search tonight.

471
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Who's first?

472
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Max and Leo.

473
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
It's better for 2 people.

474
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Could sleep in turn.

475
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I learned from movies.

476
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Alright.

477
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
You agree? Leo.

478
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Leo?

479
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
What?

480
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Watch the door tonight.

481
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Ok

482
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
He play it in the same  way you do?

483
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
No, no one play it like me.

484
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
You are gifted.

485
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Really?

486
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
He can play it well, right?

487
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,993
Don't know, I'v never seen him playing.

488
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Let's wait and see.

489
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I like this kind of music.

490
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
For a long time.

491
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,991
I havn't listened to it.

492
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
At five o' clock, the third change

493
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,991
precisely

494
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,993
Tell me, have your idea changed?

495
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,991
No.

496
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Actually, why do you like that so much?

497
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Not for anything or anyone.

498
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I just like it.

499
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Then you play it now.

500
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Now? no one answer

501
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
No need feedback in music.

502
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
We create music just want others to listen.

503
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I think we should play it at home once.

504
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,993
I don't like it.

505
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Then where should you play?

506
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Left, right, Cafe, dock

507
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
How do you think about music?

508
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
As you looking at the newspapers.

509
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Just like that?

510
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Means just one person.... forget it, can't explain.

511
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Ok, now it's 5:51

512
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,991
Let's go back.

513
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,991
Caution, police do checking.

514
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I don't know you are back at this time.

515
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I'm sure you have forgotten everything.

516
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,991
I gotta go.

517
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,993
One hour later I'll back to you.

518
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,991
Tallow cake.

519
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
No big deal, she asked for it.

520
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Then it just happenede.

521
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
You can imagine that.

522
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,991
You prepared for that.

523
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
We can't get into anything else.

524
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Or even 2 years we can't get it done.

525
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
And, watch it.

526
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Yes, let's pretend to nothing happened.

527
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,991
I don't care.

528
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I care about our boat.

529
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Could wipe out anytime by you!

530
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
You tell me what I have wiped out.

531
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,991
say it!

532
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
No, right?

533
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,993
Your question is, you never take responsibilities.

534
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Max just want to you to know that.

535
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
The real question is, from the first place.

536
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
You two were after Angela.

537
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
You didn't?

538
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
No, I didn't

539
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,991
Be honest

540
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,991
Let's go for a play.

541
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,991
COme on.

542
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,991
Come, enjoy the sunshine and beach.

543
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
It's a long time that I Played in front of people

544
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,993
Hope they'll enjoy my playing.

545
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Captain.

546
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Can you introduce this young man to me?

547
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
It's Leo.

548
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
And his brothers.

549
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Are you spanish?

550
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
We came from a place far away.

551
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Anyway, you have done a impressive playing.

552
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,991
It's the best I'v ever listened to.

553
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Yes, colonel is good in music.

554
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
He often came here.

555
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
A couth leader.

556
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
I have to say.

557
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
You can't find many in the country.

558
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,993
I'm thinking if you can come to the military area sometime.

559
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Let our soldiers share the joy,

560
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Which made by your wonderful performance.

561
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I know he'll glad to be there

562
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I'v suggested him to

563
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
That'll be great.

564
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,991
This beautiful music.

565
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
You'll play for us, won't you?

566
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Yes, we will bring you joy.

567
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
What are you saying?

568
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,991
I mean...

569
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
We like this kind of music.

570
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Captain.

571
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,993
Arrange the perform as soon as possible.

572
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
In fact, I know he's interested in music.

573
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
So I asked you to play in front of him.

574
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,993
then we'll get a concert to make in the military area.

575
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
And now we can get into it easily.

576
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
It's what we thought, right?

577
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Why are you doing these for us?

578
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Why do you take the risk?

579
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I got my reason.

580
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
A great soldier.

581
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,991
Came from my hometown

582
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
My grandpa was just like your father.

583
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
He said to do one thing you should have enough reason

584
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
He wanted me to be a military officer.

585
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,991
You listened to him?

586
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
It's a torture

587
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I'm poisoned by music either.

588
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,991
Come to music,

589
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Can you do that?

590
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
No idea, I'v never done that before.

591
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I need a place to practise

592
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
If you don't mind, you can come to my house.

593
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Enough space.

594
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
The neighbor get no utterance.

595
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,991
Go

596
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
You thinks we could make it?

597
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Maybe, step by step.

598
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Anyway, I like this place.

599
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
It's very nice to play it here.

600
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,991
It's poetic

601
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,991
I don't feel the same way.

602
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,991
What?

603
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Why?

604
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
A tiger will be bullied by a dog on a treeless plain

605
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Anyway It's not our own place.

606
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,993
Forget it, we come here for business.

607
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,991
I can't stand it.

608
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,991
You wait and see.

609
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,991
Give me your lighter.

610
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I wanna give them a lesson.

611
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,991
Charlie!

612
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Hey, asshole.

613
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,991
Fuck you!

614
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,991
Hurry

615
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,991
I'm washed-up.

616
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
We couldn't have made it if a little later.

617
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Are you alright?

618
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,993
Nothing, just never think of you can do it.

619
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
It's my first time to do that.

620
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,991
absolutely oringinal work.

621
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Your shoes are broken

622
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,993
Let go, the most important thing is running away.

623
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Seems catch up.

624
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,991
I'm chipper to die.

625
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,991
Good morning, captain.

626
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,991
Good morning, madam.

627
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Were we late?

628
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
No,why?

629
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
You can stay here for a moment.

630
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Don't be childish，Charlie

631
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Are you sure that we appointed here to see each other?

632
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Yes, she said like this.

633
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
She said the place where big ham was sold.

634
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Why do we come to the market?

635
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,993
Did she think that we came to Spain for him?

636
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Where is it?

637
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
There's too much stores.

638
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,993
But should at the palace where pork is sold.

639
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Good morning!

640
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
We are looking for Angela。

641
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Doctor Angela。

642
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
I see, wait a minute.

643
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Angela，you friends want to see you.

644
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,993
Give me 5 minutes. I haven't finished chopping the pork.

645
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,991
It's unbelievable.

646
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I come to help my aunt every Wednesday .

647
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
I started to learn to do operation there.

648
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Are you kidding.

649
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I'm not.

650
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Paying my tuition fee, I worked for her shambles for many years.

651
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Then I come to help her for free.

652
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
But it's nothing to do with your job.

653
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I don't think so.

654
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
It's crazy if I work there for full time.

655
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
But it's fun to help once in a while.

656
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
You can think like this

657
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
there are some benefits

658
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,993
you can eat good pork then.

659
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,000
He stays with these children every afternoon.

660
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
A morning many years ago

661
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,991
He left Paris.

662
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
And determine to take this career.

663
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Joined in the training.

664
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,991
He was really extraordinary.

665
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
He became a matador for the first time.

666
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
He showed great courage.

667
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
An accident came to him afterward.

668
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
But they rescued him successfully.

669
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
But he can't go to the bullring any more.

670
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
So he went to a coffee house.

671
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
worked there

672
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
and changee his name to Manolete

673
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Manolete

674
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
I didn't expect you to come.

675
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,991
Hi,

676
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Do you want to have a try?

677
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
This sport is to keep away from those horns.

678
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,991
It's a character too,

679
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,993
especially in a bullring.

680
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Is it a dream?

681
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
It's grand.

682
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Unbelievable?

683
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
It's the dreaming place of every matador.

684
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
He stayed there for 30 years .

685
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Do you know he keeps down his manteau?

686
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I don't know.

687
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,991
Maybe.

688
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,991
Do you want to see it?

689
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,991
It's the manteau.

690
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
glaring

691
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,991
The hat

692
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,991
The dress

693
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,991
and pants

694
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,991
This one has been torn out.

695
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,993
These happened long long ago.

696
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,991
I invite you to drink coffee.

697
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Look

698
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Is he Lopez?

699
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,993
Corporal Lopez，He was once a corporal.

700
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,000
He's a brave man.

701
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,991
Every musician will be welcomed here

702
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
I am always willing to do this.

703
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
You know

704
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
we are not a team.

705
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
but we share everything

706
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Those all our brothers.

707
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
We pride with this.

708
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
I think so.

709
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
This is what he said to me.

710
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Well then ，when can we start our action?

711
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
We can start at any time.

712
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,991
That's good.

713
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
We will practise it next Tuesday.

714
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
That will be a big day.

715
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Oh, I forget to show it to you

716
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
I must show it to you.

717
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,991
Our cimelia.

718
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,991
A pink Madonna.

719
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
The symbol of soul.

720
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,991
Is she great?

721
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,000
She lies in the red.

722
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Do you know what happened?

723
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,000
You also know she is very famous.

724
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
I prefer being shutting away.

725
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
I will take care of it.

726
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,993
So I won't be bothered by soul.

727
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Haven't you touched gun before?

728
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
No.   It's not difficult at all.

729
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,991
Hold it in your hand.

730
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Imagine the target as a bad egg.

731
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,991
Shoot at the bull's-eye.

732
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,991
That's it.

733
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Not bad.

734
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,991
First time at all.

735
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,991
How is Leo?

736
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,991
Fine.

737
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
But I think it's not the question you want to ask.

738
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,991
Yes.

739
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
No.

740
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Do you often talk about your home?

741
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
We don't get so much time.

742
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Listen

743
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Everything is new and happy ,

744
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,991
though I have been married.

745
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
But if only you are willing to say,

746
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
you could make the story funnier.

747
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,991
If you don't know how to, you should ask.

748
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,993
I'm the shooting champion of Spain.

749
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
It's an honor，champion.

750
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,993
Finally I think I should live like this.

751
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Don't open it. keep it closed.

752
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,991
Is it you?

753
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,991
Close it，Charlie

754
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,991
Charlie，close it.

755
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,991
I'm leaving.

756
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,991
Your shooting score is good.

757
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,991
Do you have a lighter.

758
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Pablo adopted us and bring us up.

759
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
So we three came together.

760
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
We were five then.

761
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Do you know five-aged child?

762
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
They are noisy and not lovely children.

763
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,993
We have no special feeling about our family.

764
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,993
Because we always remember that we were adopted.

765
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
We went to the Acad.

766
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
I like making waves there.

767
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,991
Charles have been to Gaza.

768
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,000
It wasn't easy to make living in those years.

769
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
For Max, he doesn't talk very much.

770
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,991
He is a wild oats.

771
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
All seems to be the same as those days.

772
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
No matter wheather we were adopted,

773
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,993
We are the sons of him.

774
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,993
The question is I am not used to it.

775
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
How do you get up with each other?

776
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Very bad, we often fight with each other.

777
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,993
Espcially Max and Charles.

778
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
You can't imagine it becomes worse.

779
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:07,000
We always put my love away,

780
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,991
and don't want to share with others.

781
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Now, We have all kinds of lives.

782
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,993
From our childhood, we have our plans.

783
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
I think that we three depend on each other for survival.

784
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,991
Excepting death.

785
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,993
I don't smoke at all, I have talked too much.

786
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
What about you?

787
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
You make love with any man you know?

788
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,991
No, not all.

789
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
The point is that I love freedom.

790
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Unconstraint .

791
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,991
I don't depend on anybody.

792
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Did you learn this from nun.

793
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Why don't be a nun?

794
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,000
I always think of my parents and family.

795
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,000
They always make me feel warm.

796
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,993
I love your grandfather very much.

797
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,000
It's him who teach me knowledge.

798
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Otherwise I would be a nun now.

799
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,991
It's hard to image?

800
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,991
This plan is very good too.

801
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Will it be a litte hazardous?

802
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
It doesn't matter, it was just a small concert.

803
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,991
But there is enough time for us to act.

804
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
I think Leo can cope with it.

805
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
There is a problem with army.

806
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
I don't know how many people will be present.

807
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
More or less a risk.

808
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Nobody said that we came to Spain for a tour.

809
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
If you have fogoten the purpose of the journey,

810
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
please tidy up your things and scram.

811
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
What a great saying!

812
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Honey, what's the matter? Don't be jealous.

813
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
You always look like this.

814
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Can't you just stop saying those turpitude words?

815
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Do they always look like this?

816
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Not too bad, they can deal with it themselves.

817
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
I want you say it.

818
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
That's enough. Both calm down.

819
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
When will you stop?

820
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Shut up! Sissy

821
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,993
Take care of your own bussiness!

822
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
What did he say?

823
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,993
Sissy,the man who doesn't have that thing.

824
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,993
I will let them know who is the sissy.

825
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
I'm refined and courteous。

826
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,993
But I'm not a sissy.

827
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,991
I remember it.

828
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,991
Yes, that's it.

829
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
that's it.

830
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,991
that's it.

831
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,991
I know...

832
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,991
Here stands a guard .

833
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Here is a washroom.

834
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Then go this way,

835
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,991
The door is open at all times.

836
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Any problem?

837
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,991
What about the key?

838
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:30,000
The key to the cabinet is in the office.

839
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,000
In the left drawer. Easy to find it.

840
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
It is always there.

841
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,000
We must make sure that everyone will go to the concert.

842
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
How much time we got?

843
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
You have about 15 minutes.

844
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
It will be no suspicion in these minutes.

845
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,000
How can we leave after we get the statuary?

846
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,000
That's leo's job. Show it to them.

847
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Look

848
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
It's the clarinet case.

849
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Seen it? When I perform the case will be empty.

850
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,993
It is flawless.

851
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,000
I will go with you if I were young.

852
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,991
must be exciting.

853
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,991
Cheers.

854
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,000
To the longevity of Babilo.

855
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,991
Cheers.

856
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,991
It's the falling sickness. Not serious.

857
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Does he often like this?

858
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,991
I don't know.

859
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
I have never seen you like this.

860
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
It make me psych out.

861
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,991
Take the medicine.

862
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,991
Max

863
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
What's wrong?

864
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,993
I don't know. Just feel ill.

865
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Feel ashamed?

866
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,991
Not this reason.

867
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,993
It's natural. It doesn't matter much.

868
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Everyone will be depressed some time.

869
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,991
Don't be this.

870
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,991
Didn't look like you.

871
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,993
Have you seen your own mother?

872
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,991
sure!

873
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,991
When I was ten.

874
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,991
But It has passed .

875
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Our mother is Pilar now.

876
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Why do you ask in this way ?

877
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,991
I don't konw ,either.

878
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,991
Every time when I bring her to my mind .

879
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,993
I wonder if I should go to see her.

880
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
And feel hesitating .

881
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,993
Don't you know where she is all along?

882
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
I have her address.

883
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
She works not far from here.

884
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,993
But I haven't been there. It has been three years.

885
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,000
I put that paper in my wallet all the times.

886
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Sometimes I take it out and have a look.

887
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,991
I understand.

888
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Feel well now?

889
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,991
Yes.

890
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,000
I know that you will feel weel if you speak it out.

891
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,991
Don't hide  it in your heart.

892
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,000
That place is not far away,is it?

893
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,991
In Spain?

894
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,991
Shall we go to visit her?

895
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,991
OK

896
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Good evening!

897
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Here comes our leading actor.

898
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,991
I lead your seat.

899
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,991
Please go this way.

900
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
So many people!

901
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
That's OK?

902
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
I'm not sure. I think it's OK.

903
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
I thought you perform alone.

904
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,000
No problem. Do as usual.

905
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,000
I am interested in nothing but musical performance.

906
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,991
Sit down.

907
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,993
Let's go now. OK, you take the case.

908
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Shit, I has been locked.

909
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Surely it is locked.

910
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Find someting to unlock it.

911
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Hurry!

912
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,991
It doesn't work.

913
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
See how professional I am.

914
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,000
How can you do that?

915
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,991
It has no key.

916
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,991
Great!

917
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,991
I can't unlock it.

918
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,993
Change another one. You may mistake it.

919
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Don't hasten me.

920
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Someone comes. keep close.

921
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,991
dub!

922
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,991
What is he doing?

923
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,993
We go out after they leave.

924
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,991
Must have been finished.

925
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,991
Why are you back?

926
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
I has been locked.

927
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
What shall we do now?   I don't know.

928
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Shall we leave now. We can come to see another time.

929
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,993
We can't be absent for too long.

930
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,000
You may have not listened to the following way of performing.

931
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,991
I expect a pleasantly surprise.

932
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,991
He is extraordinary .

933
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,991
Yes, but it is really wonderful.

934
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,991
Great!

935
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,000
What shall we take?

936
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,991
We have done our best.

937
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
But Pablo won't understand.

938
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,991
Pardon?

939
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,991
We don't want this either.

940
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Any other plans for us?

941
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Yes, we can change our plan.

942
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
What else can we do now?

943
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Shall we expend like this?

944
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Let them sing next time?

945
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,993
Don't say it now.

946
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
It's just a Madonna, isn't it?

947
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,991
Don't say unlack words.

948
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
They did a lot.

949
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,993
Now we'd better have a good sleep.

950
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,993
We can think clearly then.

951
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
It's late at night now.

952
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,991
Max

953
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Where is Angela？

954
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,991
I think she has gone.

955
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
She is not here.

956
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,991
She didn't have any operation today.

957
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,993
I don't know where she has gone.

958
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
We want to see Gabo.

959
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,991
He is not here.

960
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Do you know where he went?

961
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Where is Gabo

962
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,991
I don't know .

963
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,991
Have you seen him?

964
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
They said he got a vacation of a week.

965
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,000
I don't know where he has been.

966
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
And we can't find Leo either.

967
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,000
What happened?

968
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,991
Nobody is here.

969
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,991
Miguel

970
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Miguel

971
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,993
Where did they go?

972
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,991
Even him has disappeared.

973
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
What are you doing?

974
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,000
You see clearly what I am doing.

975
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,000
What happened to other people.

976
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,000
They all disappeared.

977
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Our appointment is at one o'clock.

978
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Tidy up your luggage.

979
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Will you go at noon?

980
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Why in such a hurry?

981
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Pablo can't wait that long.

982
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Why don't you return with us?

983
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,991
I want to stay.

984
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,991
I don't want to go.

985
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,991
It's her.

986
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
How can you do this?

987
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
No need to say.

988
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
The point is we get the Madonna.

989
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,000
What about the captain?

990
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Don't worry about him.

991
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,000
You must repatriate quickly. That's the most important thing now.

992
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,000
You take this photo to Pablo as a memento.

993
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Tell him that I have a good time every day.

994
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,991
Better than him.

995
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Won't you go with us?

996
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
It's the first time I find a place and people suit for me.

997
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:13,000
You can understand me,can't you? I think Pilar can.

998
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Tell Pablo that all things go as he expected.

999
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,991
Let's go.

1000
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,991
Goodbye.

1001
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Take care!

1002
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,991
So to you.

1003
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,993
Never mind.I'll go with you.

1004
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,000
I don't understand why Leo said

1005
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,000
all things go by as Pablo expected.

1006
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Because it's Leo, who is hard to understand.

1007
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,000
I think his meaning is

1008
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Madonna isn't the most important thing to him.

1009
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Why said that?

1010
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Leo think that the reason that your father let you come here

1011
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
is make you review the past.

1012
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,000
You three brothers joined together over again in this course.

1013
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Did you said to you like this?

1014
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,993
Just my opinion is like his.

1015
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Whether or no, it's the end of the journey.

1016
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,991
It's over.

1017
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,991
My brother's.

1018
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,991
Sergent，look this.

1019
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,000
If there is something misgivings, Let's go away.

1020
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:26,993
Do yuu think we can escape?

1021
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,993
I am …Sergent.

1022
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Sergent，listen to me

1023
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,000
You must hold your post.

1024
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,991
It's an order.

1025
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Sergent，are you there?

1026
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Great.

1027
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,993
If you bother me for thess jackasseris any more,

1028
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
please stop your job,

1029
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
and transfer to manage the dirt-wagons.

1030
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Is that clear for you?

1031
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Now that I say that she is still there.

1032
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,993
It must be a copy.

1033
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Do you want to explain now?

1034
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
What should I say to make you happy?

1035
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
OK, that's enough.

1036
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Why can't we regard nothing has happened?

1037
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Even if we steal it successfully some day,

1038
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
captain will know it soon.

1039
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:00,000
He will know it was done by you.

1040
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
So Gabo ask Miguel to make a copy.

1041
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,000
It's a hard work, do you know?

1042
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Yes, it is.

1043
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,000
It's a copy.

1044
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,000
How can we tell it to Pablo.

1045
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Don't say anything.

1046
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,991
Excepting that he asks.

1047
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Why don't you stop here?

1048
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
You get out here.

1049
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Why should I get out here?

1050
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Do you see that house?

1051
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,000
There lives someone who you keep thinking in these three years.

1052
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
You really have problem.

1053
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Above all, how do you know here?

1054
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,000
I saw the paper in your wallet.

1055
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Go, there's no problem.

1056
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:20,993
Get in, look at her, and tell her who you are.

1057
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
I know it is a little difficult.

1058
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,993
We are waiting for you here.

1059
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,991
Go.

1060
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,991
He comes back.

1061
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
What?

1062
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Can we go now?

1063
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,000
I want to stay here for a short time.

1064
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,991
Have you seen her?

1065
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
What's wrong?

1066
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,000
I don't know.

1067
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:49,000
I think I should stay for a short time.

1068
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
So we return first.

1069
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
You want Pilar explain it, don't you?

1070
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,993
Don't worry, I think she will understand.

1071
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,993
OK, you help me take the case back.

1072
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,991
Anybody in?

1073
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,991
Pablo. Pilar.

1074
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,991
Where are they?

1075
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,991
It's too late now.

1076
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Where is other people?

1077
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Leo stays there.

1078
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,000
How are those friends?  They are  fine.

1079
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Where's Max? Is he OK.

1080
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,000
He just have someone to see.

1081
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,000
He wants to see her all the time.

1082
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
I know that when he was a child.

1083
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Yes.

1084
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Oh，this is Angela

1085
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,991
Gabo's litte girl.

1086
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:17,993
She reminds me of much memory.

1087
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,000
It's Miguel's masterpiece.

1088
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,992
He is always good that this.

1089
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
How is Gabo going on?

1090
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
He is old.

1091
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,991
Always try to compare with me?

1092
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Doesn't he?

1093
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Yes.

1094
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Last time  I saw him was on the mountain.

1095
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Why don't you see each other any more?

1096
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
I can take you there now?

1097
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
There's no need.

1098
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,991
It's nice to call him.

1099
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Have you called each other?

1100
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:20,000
I thought you haven't talked for 30 years.

1101
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
We got in touch afterward.

1102
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,000
talking the recent situation of each other.

1103
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,991
talking about past

1104
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,000
You see it?

1105
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:32,993
I'm sure they look older than me.

1106
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:23,993
The End
