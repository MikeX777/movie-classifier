1
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,840
- Carol? Carol?
- Michael?

2
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,079
What the hell are you doing here?
You thought I was gonna let you

3
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,759
do this on your own, did you?

4
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,960
Did you? Is that what you
thought? Go get the bags.

5
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,679
Hold on, have you spoken to
Keenan? Look, forget about Keenan.

6
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,280
It's just us now, love.
- It's just us. - Do you mean it?

7
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:33,800
Of course I mean it.

8
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,080
I mean it.

9
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,920
Watch yourself. - You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

10
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,520
Christ.

11
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,359
You've got great timing

12
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,400
you're the one that's early!

13
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,599
- My love.
- What the fuck is that?

14
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,999
Don't worry, I'll get
rid of it down south.

15
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,400
Oh, yeah. Like that'll
be of use in the hospital

16
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,040
Weapon sighted.

17
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,240
Bandit's heading south.

18
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,399
Christ! Has this thing
got square wheels or what?

19
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,720
Don't fly anywhere, love.

20
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,840
Just you hold onto
the wee fella.

21
00:03:44,841 --> 00:03:46,960
I don't want him bouncing out!

22
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,000
Oh, it's good to see you.

23
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,320
You know I didn't wanna
do this without you.

24
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,720
What? What is it?

25
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,519
Shit. You can lose
them in the woods.

26
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,919
Carol, I'm not leaving you.

27
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,240
- Just go. Just go, please!
- I'm not leaving you with them fuckers.

28
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,359
I know, Michael, but if you stay,
we don't stand a chance, ok?

29
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,880
They're not after me.
Go on, please, Michael!

30
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Go!

31
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,520
Go! Go! Go!

32
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,120
British army!

33
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,440
O'Hara, do not move!

34
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,679
Major fucking propaganda victory
for the Republicans, tempest.

35
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,039
What the hell happened?

36
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,079
Intel reported a
weapon in the car.

37
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,001
Sir, sib's at the gate.
- Shall I let them in? - No.

38
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,719
You don't expect us to believe that?
- The bandit had six kills. - Seven.

39
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,120
- Sir?
- Ryan didn't make it.

40
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,600
But your bandit did.
Fuck knows where he is.

41
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,880
Go on.

42
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,439
British army!
O'Hara, do not move!

43
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,279
We were tipped off
about his location but

44
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,920
When we moved in, we found
the vehicle abandoned.

45
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,079
I thought I was facing
an imminent threat, sir.

46
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,439
You thought you were
going to be shot?

47
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,040
That was my reading of the
situation. I was about to be shot.

48
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,480
By a pregnant woman in labour?

49
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,880
Sir, sib are-fuck off!

50
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,319
Well, that's that, then.
Glad we sorted that out.

51
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,639
This shitshow doesn't end

52
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,680
With us hoicking snowy
here out in a chopper.

53
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:56,719
We don't have that authority.
No you don't but I do.

54
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,560
Tempest, would you wait outside?

55
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,760
Can I have the room?

56
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,000
- This room?
- Get out.

57
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,639
Soldiers are here in
support of the civil power.

58
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,999
They have no legal authority beyond
that of an ordinary civilian.

59
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,959
Any actions they take

60
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,519
must be in accordance with
the laws of the United Kingdom

61
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,680
And are, in fact,
punishable by those laws.

62
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,439
I'm aware of the
yellow card, sir.

63
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,119
Good...

64
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,440
Because you are about to
be prosecuted for murder.

65
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,360
There are... two
ways out of this.

66
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,199
One, we open that door.

67
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,560
We let sib in to rip you apart.

68
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:23,159
Your commanding officers,
they'll try and protect you

69
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,680
but you'll cease
to be a soldier.

70
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,520
You'll spend the next three
years sharpening pencils

71
00:09:28,521 --> 00:09:31,240
for a bunch of lawyers and then
you'll probably go to prison.

72
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,680
Or...

73
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,639
You come and work for me.

74
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,760
I'm putting together a detachment.
I could use a dead shot like you.

75
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,200
And what about all this?

76
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,999
I'll make it go away.

77
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,400
You make it sound easy, sir.

78
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,360
I assure you it'll be
anything but easy...

79
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,720
But you'll continue to serve your
country and do what you do best.

80
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,240
Where do I report, sir?

81
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,120
It's not really...
That sort of thing.

82
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,919
Do you have somewhere
you can stay off grid?

83
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,400
Somewhere that isn't
the barracks? I do.

84
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,000
Good.

85
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,040
Good. I'll see you in London.

86
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,880
Carol's voice: Michael,
I'm right here, darling.

87
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,560
I'm right here. Look.

88
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,480
It's ok, Michael.

89
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,760
Look, you had to go.

90
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,160
'shops and offices were closed

91
00:14:08,161 --> 00:14:10,559
as hundreds of people lined
the route of the funeral.

92
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,119
In the church of
the sacred heart,

93
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,719
the circumstances of Carol's
shooting were referred to

94
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,720
by father Joe McVeigh as a day of
tragedy that had touched everyone-'

95
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,040
we're so sorry for your loss.

96
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,439
Look... I'm not a
doctor. I'm a vet.

97
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,640
Cats and dogs. You'll need someone
to check those wounds for you.

98
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,840
- Thank you.
- Michael?

99
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,720
There is another way, you know?

100
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,119
There was.

101
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,160
Not any more.

102
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,280
Orla mcshawn, colm mcneish.

103
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,360
What the hell are you playing
at turning up here like this?

104
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:30,400
I thought you were dead.

105
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,880
I have business with the
man that killed Carol.

106
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,840
Brits flew him to London.

107
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,559
I need you to get me there.

108
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,720
I'm sorry but you
wanted out, Michael.

109
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,600
- I'll do whatever it takes.
- You're not gonna like what it takes.

110
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,600
But I could use a man
they think is dead.

111
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,199
I'm taking twomey. Peadar
twomey's got problems.

112
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,840
Not with me he hasn't.

113
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,159
If we're to do this...

114
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,520
There'll be no more talk of getting
out until I say so, understood?

115
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,520
I need you to say it.

116
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Understood.

117
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,959
And, Michael?

118
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm gonna need that ring.

119
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,920
Just give me the
name of that soldier.

120
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,160
Sheila went back
with her mother.

121
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,200
Didn't like it... Stuck
all the way out here.

122
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,039
Still... I have
the dog, I suppose.

123
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,080
Best dog I've ever had.

124
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,160
I heard about Carol.

125
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,760
Fucking bastards.

126
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,560
I'm heading over the
water. I want you to come.

127
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,640
Keenan's putting us
with a unit. I can't.

128
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,319
The dog would miss me too much.

129
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,359
You know, he'd be
lost without me.

130
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,999
I'm going after the
soldier that killed Carol.

131
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,519
I need your help.

132
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,640
The papers are coming tonight.

133
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,680

00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:30,040
For now... I'm going to be
sending someone else, ok?

176
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,480
Morning, fiadh.

177
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,560
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

178
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,880
Your son is dead.

179
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,599
Michael died as a
result of injuries

180
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,640
he sustained in the
ambush with Carol.

181
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,279
We'll take care of
all the arrangements.

182
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,880
I'm afraid it won't be
possible to see the body.

183
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,400
The organisation sends
you its deepest sympathy.

184
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,120
15 he was, when you
took him from me.

185
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,000
He should be here now doing
this while I fix the tea.

186
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,239
We've been selling milk
for nearly 80 years

187
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,480
north of the border,
south of the border.

188
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,639
When you and your lot finish
your games of lying and killing,

189
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,680
These cows will still be here.

190
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,760
And people will
still drink milk.

191
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,879
You ever set foot
on my land again...

192
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,920
I'll shoot you dead,
so help me god.

193
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,640
You got another boyfriend or - something?
- Uh-uh.

194
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,360
One sec!

195
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,679
Good morning.

196
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,199
- Is tempest here?
- Erm...

197
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,560
Would you mind fetching
him for me, please?

198
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,960
Who the hell is this
guy? Army stuff.

199
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,240
How did he know you're
here? I told him.

200
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,919
What?

201
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:46,496
I told him that if... if I wasn't
here, you know where to find me.

202
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,520
I'm sorry.

203
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,560
Sir?

204
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:01,496
Make yourself at home
sir, this is... Ruth.

205
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,519
Yes. We just met.

206
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,920
Right. Shall we go?

207
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,800
I'll explain later.
Damn right you will.

208
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,599
I hope... I hope I
wasn't interrupting.

209
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:57,320
You weren't, sir.
Call me Holland.

210
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,759
What's the situation,
sir? There's no situation.

211
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,200
We're just going for a look-see.

212
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,840
Do you know... I've never
been to kentish town.

213
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,000
Two teas, please, love.

214
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,520
Biggest mugs you've got.
Tempest, Lance corporal Cole.

215
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,640
Beginning to think you
were gonna miss the party.

216
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,479
- How many?
- Not sure. And where are they?

217
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,640
Number 34, just over the way.

218
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,680
Third floor. First
flat on the left.

219
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:02,200
Watching television.
What do you think, boys?

220
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,440
Time to ask a few questions?

221
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,599
Have you got any
idea who they are?

222
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,000
Hard to see the rank
under the civvies.

223
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,280
I was hoping you'd tell me.

224
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,440
Didn't even have
time to pack a bag.

225
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,360
Quick as you can, they said.

226
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,400
More like, hurry up and wait.

227
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,479
Gas man.

228
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,800
This is a job for
the fucking police.

229
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,640
Cole.

- Belfast.

And what's the
purpose of your visit?

240
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:30,039
I'm looking up an old friend.
- Another Mick? - English.

241
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,080
And why have you
come over to see him?

242
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,560
He doesn't have long to live.

243
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,240
Through the wrong bloody door!

244
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,759
Tempest. Excellent work.

245
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,800
Do you fancy some tea?
I don't want any tea.

246
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:02,240
I want someone to tell me what
the fuck is going on, sir.

247
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,920
Mcgill and Miller. They
were Belfast. The ira.

248
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,079
And they've been giving
London a taste of the troubles

249
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,879
Since the spring. A bomb
a week, random targets.

250
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,479
Department stores,
restaurants, nightclubs.

251
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,879
And he was shot on
his own doorstep

252
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:26,679
Assassinated in broad daylight
in the United Kingdom.

253
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:29,880
The country's not seen bloodshed
on this scale since the war.

254
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,839
Number 10's had enough.

255
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,719
They wanna fight back...
On their terms. Dirty.

256
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,680
Like the filthy
animals they are.

257
00:34:40,681 --> 00:34:42,679
And given that our boys

258
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,919
aren't exactly equipped...
For this kind of business...

259
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,960
We brought you in.

260
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,199
Any more questions?

261
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,240
Did you just call
us animals, sir?

262
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,320
You are animals...

263
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,400
But you're my animals.

264
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,080
Which reminds me... Your
bandit finally showed up.

265
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,680
Buried yesterday.
Full military honours.

266
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,399
On behalf of the good guys...

267
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,440
Cheers.

268
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,880
The lads are expecting you.

269
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,640
Stay away from the
Irish community.

270
00:35:44,641 --> 00:35:47,519
Avoid the pubs and clubs
Irish people go to.

271
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,560
They'll be under surveillance.

272
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:55,439
The only person we talk to, apart
from other members of the asu,

273
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,400
is the courier.

274
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,959
- You must be mcgill.
- Mcgill's dead.

275
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,000
Who the fuck are you?

276
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:44,040
You first. Quinn, engineer.

277
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,680
What about you, big
man? Liam hogan, qm.

278
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,679
Who the fuck are you?

279
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,359
I'm Joe lynch.

280
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,959
I'm the driver and
I make the tea.

281
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,799
They're stopping
people in the street.

282
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,279
They'll pat you down as soon
as they hear your accent.

283
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,920
They'd do a better job
than you then, would they?

284
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,040
Hey!

285
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,080
Go on, then. I'm listening.

286
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,160
I'm working with the police.

287
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,120
What? The police? Henry.

288
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,399
Not exactly with but...

289
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:29,000
..It's complicated.

290
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,560
And that guy from this morning,
he's got a bloody nose too?

291
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,360
No, I didn't think so.

292
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,920
You know, my dad used to
work for a man like him.

293
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Superintendent.

294
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,839
Promised him a better life if he
went to fight for king and country

295
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,760
But... when my dad came
home, he got nothing.

296
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,040
Just a job cleaning
shit out of toilets.

297
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,320
There's no king or
country for you, Henry.

298
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,320
You're just a black man
in a white man's world.

299
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,560
No-one's looking out for you.

300
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,560
The old man sends his regards.

301
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,280
I came here for a name.

302
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,599
I know why you're here but
that was before kentish town.

303
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,199
First you have to deliver a box.

304
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,880
A station. You choose.

305
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,640
That's a big fucking box. It's
gonna take time. I can't be waiting.

306
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,840
We both know that
isn't how it works.

307
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,559
All right.

308
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,600
I'll do it but you
gotta give me that name.

309
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,479
To be clear, personal
agendas have no place here.

310
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,520
Please just give me the name.

311
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,000
Wait! Henry?

312
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Hiya.

313
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,320
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm
not really open.

314
00:41:52,321 --> 00:41:55,039
It's a bit of an
emergency. Erm...

315
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,080
I'm looking for
something for my wife.

316
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,000
Er... what are you after?

317
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:05,360
- A dress.
- Do you know what size?

318
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,000
No.

319
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,960
All right, is she bigger
or smaller than me, then?

320
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,681
Erm... she's a little
bit smaller than you.

321
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,640
What colour's her hair?

322
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,760
Red.

323
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,280
And her eyes?

324
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,720
Blue.

325
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,760
Lucky girl.

326
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,040
She sounds beautiful.

327
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,760
- She was.
- Where is it?

328
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,000
Here it is.

329
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,439
He's in a beige Mac.

330
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,079
I swear I saw a gun.

331
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:06,200
Right, you look that way and
then search this end, yeah?

332
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,520
There you are. I love that bag.

333
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,800
This way.

334
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,839
What's the matter with you?

335
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,960
She's not even a
legitimate target.

336
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,200
The path to freedom has rules.

337
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:57,600
There is a code. You break
those and the objective fails.

338
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,240
The path to freedom?

339
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:06,080
You really are one of Keenan's
little soldiers, aren't you?

340
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,159
I was top of the class too once.

341
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,400
Except back then, people didn't
talk like a fucking brit.

342
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,800
You have no idea what
you're dealing with.

343
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:29,400
The man you want is working for
the police hunting your unit.

344
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,520
Right now, my odds are on him.

345
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,080
Have you ever been in love?

346
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,480
Have you?

347
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,919

signed up to nanny the police.

01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:55,240
I'll see you again, Michael.

521
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,480
At least you know now
who you're sleeping with.

522
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:13,000
He's my dad.

523
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:16,999
What?

524
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,879
My mum was English.

525
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:21,680
They met over here.
He was a student.

526
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,920
I'm his guilty secret.

He joked that if I
couldn't be in Ireland...

529
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,840
He'd bring Ireland to me.

530
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:46,080
I've spent all this time
mistaking his hate for love.

531
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:51,840
I can't do it any more.

532
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,880

536
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,799
- Leaving for Boston.
- Boston?

537
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:14,000
You think you can outrun Keenan?

538
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:19,160
I think you know your
da as well as I do.

539

we keep doing what he asks.

542
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:24,999
Then what's he planning?

543
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,120
I get orders from the
courier most of the time.

544
01:07:28,121 --> 01:07:30,919
Courier? What courier? It's a
woman. I don't know her name.

545
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:33,720
That's all I know.
I just make the tea.

546

550

But we're looking to
scale up the detachment

551
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:34,359
so take as many men as you like,
get yourself back to bandit country

552
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,199
and rip this thing
out by the root.

553
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:38,319
What about O'Hara, sir?
He's not gonna make it.

554

The whole country's
looking for him.

555
01:08:40,121 --> 01:08:42,880
With all due respect, sir,
I'd like to finish this.

556
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:49,400
You're angry. I can
understand that.

557
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:52,399
It feels personal because
he made it personal

558
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:54,000

bigger than you or I.

the prison ship,

for a man in your position.
