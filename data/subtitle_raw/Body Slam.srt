1
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:05,464
That'll replace your Adam's apple

2
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:07,508
from the front of your neck
to the back.

3
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:11,136
Now a leaping, flying body press,
and that is going to be illegal

4
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:12,363
because he got him with an elbow,

5
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:14,223
but they're
not gonna call anything.

6
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:16,266
This referee might as well
be home watching T.V.

7
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:19,520
Harry Smilac looking on,
pounding in disgust,

8
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:22,773
now he's trying to get to his feet. Now,
here's Rick, staggering around.

9
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:24,107
Oh, look at this!

10
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,151
It's an overhead body slam!

Yeah, right. And, uh, listen,

54
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,473
uh, don't park it
near anyone, buddy.

55
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:05,268
I, uh, I don't need any dings on the doors,
do you know what I mean, uh?

56
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,522
Message for you, Mr. Smilac.

57
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,148
Ah! Great.

58
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,986
Hey! Hey, you!

59
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,578
Brooks, get me my lawyer, ok?

60
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,540
Get me Sheldon Brockmeister
on the phone.

61
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:29,292
Did you forget to sent him
a check last week?

62
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,460
So what?

63
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:33,422
By now that baby'll be
bouncin' all over his office.

64
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,508
Well, that'll just give him a very
good reason to see me, won't it, huh?

65
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,302
Oh... will you just call
Sheldon's secretary?

66
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,888
Oh, and, uh, tell her
I'm... I'm racing right over.

67
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,474
Your dime.

68
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:47,352
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Yeah.

69
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,312
Back, 2, 3, 4.

70
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,856
Bigger circles. Come on.

71
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:54,943
Right. Forward, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

72
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,487
Take a break.

73
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:58,905
Whoo!

74
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,074
See that?

75
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:02,909
Gimme 3 weeks,
I'm gonna look just like that.

76
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,327
Well, I can hardly wait.

77
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:10,584
Uh, Shelly, what... what
employment agency do you use?

78
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,628
Talk, Harry. I know it's serious,
or you wouldn't be here.

79
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,297
Especially after
that check you sent me.

80
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,382
Oh, that was just
a bookkeeping error.

81
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,092
All I do is put
the check through again.

82
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,887
But look, I need your,
uh, expert legal advice

83
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,431
on a few minor matters here.

84
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:25,742
Before you go on, you should know

85
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,517
I'm charging $400 an hour
to listen to this.

86
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,394
$400?

87
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:30,979
Uh, right.

88
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:39,488
Ok, number 1: My car has
been repossessed. Again?

89
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,239
Shapiro's gonna evict me

90
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,408
if I don't get the rent by Friday.

91
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:47,162
I was handed a subpoena.

92
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:49,664
Harry, you know,
I just don't understand you.

93
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,374
You're a smart guy.

94
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,293
For a while,
you had the midas touch.

95
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:55,855
I mean, your acts were winning grammys,
people really liked you.

96
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,923
But lately, excuse my French,

97
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,217
everything you handle
turns to caca.

98
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:03,303
Shelly, I've just been a little
down on my luck lately. That's all.

99
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:04,721
No, you do it to yourself, Harry.

100
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,556
You're always looking
for the easy way out,

101
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,517
the shortcut, the quick fix.

102
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,162
It's just like that loan you took out
from that Korean savings and loan.

103
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:14,439
Who does things like that? How was I
supposed to know it was for 30 days?

104
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,483
The loan documents were
in Japanese. Korean, Harry.

105
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,401
You're just lucky
I beat it on a technicality.

106
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,905
You always have some excuse. Well,
I don't have an excuse this time.

107
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,574
All right, Shelly, you gotta help me,
please? Give me a hand.

108
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,803
Just take a look. I'm in a
real jam. I'll see what you got.

109
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,245
There, you see? Yeah, I see.

110
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,164
Yeah

111
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:34,334
phew! There's a lot of stuff
here. I know that, Shelly.

112
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:35,377
Oh, boy.

113
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:41,466
You know, maybe we can
help each other out.

114
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,009
Yeah? Yeah.

115
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,136
I could handle the credit
card subpoena. Yeah?

116
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,680
Take care of Shapiro.

117
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:49,474
If all goes well, I can take a
crack at getting your car back.

118
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:50,976
I'll tell you what.

119
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,436
I'll even advance you a couple
of thousand as sort of a loan.

120
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:56,606
Great. And, uh,
what do I have to do for you?

121
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,109
Do you remember,
uh, bits y Vandervagen?

122
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,443
No, I... I, uh...

123
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,862
Vandervagen, department stores,

124
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,197
one of my biggest clients.
Oh, right, right.

125
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,575
Well, bitsy's been appointed
chairperson of

126
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,703
the finance committee for Norton
Wilshire's campaign for governor

127
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,746
I was appointed co-chairman,

128
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:15,000
and I am now appointing you
entertainment chairman.

129
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,210
Norton Wilshire?

130
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:18,920
I can't believe this, Shel.

131
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,881
I mean, you've always had
impeccable taste.

132
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:24,467
Norton Wilshire, I mean,
he's a pompous, phony windbag.

133
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,927
He's... he's... he's dickless.

134
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,637
Harry, cool it, all right?

135
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,907
I'm not asking you to vote
for the man. All right, go ahead.

136
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,475
I just want you to do what you do best,
just arrange the acts.

137
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:35,520
You know, this could be just what
you need to get back on your feet.

138
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,522
"Back on my feet."
I start calling in favors

139
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:38,875
for a Norton Wilshire fund raiser,

140
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,692
I'll be history
in the music business.

141
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,653
Harry, I'm giving you a chance here... no,
no, no, no. I can't do it.

142
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,071
I am sorry. I just cannot do it.

143
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:48,158
You know, I have a few
principles left. Yeah. Well-hidden.

144
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,326
Ha, ha.

145
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,912
Harry.

146
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,080
You don't take my deal,
what are you gonna do?

147
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,082
What I always do. Manage.

148
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,593
You seem bigger onscreen,
Mr. Eastwood.

149
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:08,094
I know, thanks for the lift, huh.

150
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,559
Don't do anything to it,
just give her a bill.

151
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,787
She'll never know the difference. Hey,
Scotty, how ya doin'?

152
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,564
No, no, whatever it is,
the answer is absolutely not!

153
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,709
Hey, what? Every time you
come in here it costs me money.

154
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,777
Oh, what are you talkin' about?

155
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,779
I... listen,
$1700 for the Ferrari.

156
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,615
What, you didn't get the
check? No! Check? Come on.

157
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,617
There's $4,000
the insurance company

158
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,577
had to pay for the loaner car
that you wrecked.

159
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,704
And then,
there is the little matter

160
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:38,124
of my waiting in a restaurant
for hours and hours and hours

161
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,669
for some Hollywood starlet
who was supposed to show up

162
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,836
and spend the night with me!

163
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,630
This is unbelievable.
You know, I tell you,

164
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:46,591
I come here to do you a favor,
and you jump all over me

165
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:47,860
with all those ancient history.

166
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,886
You're gonna do me
a favor? That's right.

167
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:53,640
I just happen to have
4 tickets and <i>2</i> dates

168
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,976
to a Bruce Springsteen
concert tonight.

169
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,561
I immediately thought of my
good friend Scotty, you know.

170
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:01,606
Thought maybe we could double up and,
uh, you know, have some laughs.

171
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,651
But, no, no, no, I don't want to
cause you any problems. So forget it.

172
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,486
Wa-wa-wa-wait.

173
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:08,738
Springsteen?

174
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,781
Himself.

175
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,617
Uh, what does, uh,

176
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,244
what does my, uh, date look like?

177
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:18,540
Scotty, Vegas showgirls.
Beautiful!

178
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,916
You can have your pick.

179
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,669
Well, ok.

180
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,671
It's a deal. All right.

181
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,548
Got it. Thanks, Scotty. Really.

182
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,776
I gotta pick 'em up at the airport,
comin' in in 30 minutes.

183
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,093
Ok? All right. All right.

184
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,386
Oh, god!

185
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:34,597
God, I got the Ferrari,
it's only got <i>2</i> seats.

186
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,141
Ah. Yeah.

187
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,977
Hey, wait a minute. Isn't that
my landlord Byron Shapiro's car?

188
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,603
Yeah.

189
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,188
Well, what's wrong with it?

190
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,607
Oh, there's nothing wrong
with it. It's ready to go back.

191
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,151
Wait, no, I got it. Oh, no.

192
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,944
No, no, look.
I'll do you a favor.

193
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,821
Let me use the car
to pick the girls up,

194
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:53,283
and then I can return the car to
Shapiro himself tomorrow morning.

195
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,826
Oh, gosh, I don't know.

196
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,120
Oh, come on, Scotty.
It'll be our little secret.

197
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,664
Shapiro never has to know. Huh?

198
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,666
I don't know, Harry.
Great! Great!

199
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,335
Scotty, your wife's on line 1.

200
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,550
Scotty, Angeline is on line 2.

201
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,720
What? Harry.

202
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:17,182
Yeah. Uh, just for old time's sake,
uh, I'll hold the tickets.

203
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:22,062
Oh, Scotty, when are you
gonna learn to trust me?

204
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:25,190
Scotty, Angeline is on line <i>2</i>
please.

205
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,485
Son of a bitch.

206
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,747
Well, that's the truth.

207
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,459
You're kidding. Uh-uh.

208
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,211
You never told me you were the one

209
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,588
who told Madonna
to wear trashy lingerie.

210
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,132
Oh, sure.
Helped her pick it out, too.

211
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,634
Really.

212
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,844
Tell you what,
why don't I go turn on the jacuzzi?

213
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,223
- You're on.
- Ok.

214
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,767
Oh, listen, if I got
a great white wine...

215
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:01,976
Mr. Smirac.

216
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,859
I am Mr. Kim from
the Pusang savings and loan.

217
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,237
Vice president, corrections.

218
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,072
Corrections?

219
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,991
I correct money
from deadbeats like you.

220
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,869
You owe us considerable sum.

221
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:22,622
Ah, uh, honey,
why don't you go on ahead in?

222
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:23,849
I'll be there in just a minute.

223
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:24,874
Ok. Yeah.

224
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,213
Look, Mr. Kim,

225
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:33,424
you guys, you remember,
you took me to court. You lost.

226
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,844
You have a good lawyer,
Mr. Smirac.

227
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,888
I know. But in my country,
we have a saying...

228
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,602
I understand, but what can I do?

229
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,604
I mean, uh, the judge
made his decision.

230
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,898
It's legal, even in Japan.

231
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,860
Korea, Mr. Smirac. Not Japan.

232
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,778
Korea. Oh, whatever.

233
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,822
Different eyes,
different language.

234
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:58,908
Mr. Kim,
what do you want from me?

235
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:02,704
$67,811.19,

236
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,915
to be very specific.

237
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:07,542
Tell you what I'll do.

238
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:10,879
How about records
for you and the missus?

239
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,506
How about this, Mr. Smirac?

240
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,386
Ah, well, no problem.

241
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,138
Records for them, too.

242
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,515
Ah, no, 0k, ok.

243
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:26,019
Well, uh, maybe some concert tickets,
how about that?

244
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,730
No? All right, uh, uh,
t-shirts for the kids?

245
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,815
Ah, you... you guys have any kids?

246
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,483
No? All right.

247
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,735
You know, this isn't funny.

248
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:37,071
$67,811.19!

249
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:40,033
You know, I have powerful
friends in very high places!

250
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:43,369
Mine powerful, too, and closer.

251
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,538
Ah. Hey! No!

252
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,228
I got to push this
back in the city.

253
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,754
This is an exotic car
I got here...

254
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,964
Oh, Christ! That's just...

255
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,674
Do you know whose car this is?

256
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:10,855
I was probably a little hasty,
calling him dickless.

257
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,690
I'm sure he's quite well...

258
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,234
Shelly, I give you my word,

259
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,945
I will go down to the
convention center this afternoon

260
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,279
and arrange everything. Really.

261
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:21,074
The... the lighting, the stage,
the sound system, everything.

262
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,201
Smilac! Smilac!

263
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,869
Smilac, are you in there?

264
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,788
I'll get you, Smilac!

265
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,624
Uh, listen, Shelly,
I, uh, have a feeling

266
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,210
that Shapiro's
trying to reach me and...

267
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,295
I'll get you! You bastard!

268
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:35,672
My car.

269
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,059
Hi. Harry Smilac
to see Tom McMillan.

270
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,477
You missed your appointment.

271
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,312
You were supposed to be here
an hour ago.

272
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:53,648
I love the color
of that blouse, it...

273
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,651
Mr. McMillan has somebody
with him right now.

274
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,404
Why don't you just
have a seat right over there?

275
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,446
Right.

276
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,418
So, uh, what's his name?

277
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,461
Who wants to know?

278
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,297
Well, my name is Harry.

279
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,590
And whom might I have
the pleasure of speaking to?

280
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,134
Nobody.

281
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,761
My uncle Ricky says old men
who talk to little kids are perverts.

282
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,227
Roberts, what's your problem?

283
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:33,896
There's something here
that is not right.

284
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,606
I don't understand.

285
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,276
I got 20 guys that'll sign
this thing in a minute.

286
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,611
Well, then you get them
to sign the contract!

287
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,488
Oh, come on, let's not
get difficult here.

288
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,032
I'm not being difficult!

289
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,218
Make up your mind. We're gonna
do this with you or without you.

290
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,202
Hi, I'm Harry Smilac.

291
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,705
I need to talk to you about
the Norton Wilshire fund raiser.

292
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:51,914
What is this? A country club.

293
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,042
What do I look like,
I'm on my coffee break?

294
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,626
I am tied up right now.

295
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,980
I understand. No, no, no,
no. I will get to you when I'm ready.

296
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,881
All I need is 5 minutes. Out!

297
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,049
Out! All right, all right.

298
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,175
Did you... out!

299
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,135
<i>OK, 0k.</i>

300
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,928
All right, Roberts,
what's it gonna be?

301
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,015
I don't understand this.

302
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,893
You're paying me the exact same
money as you paid me in Frisco,

303
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,978
only the gate's twice as much.

304
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,564
I told you,
your manager made the deal.

305
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:20,526
My manager... I forgot to
mention Sheldon Brockmeister,

306
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,404
my lawyer, he's a close personal
friend of senator Norton Wilshire...

307
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:26,949
Terrific, terrific. Give 'em both
my regards on your way out.

308
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,785
Wait... wait a
minute. I just... out!

309
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:29,827
If I could...

310
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,414
Very simple, Roberts.

311
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:37,210
Either sign the paper,
or follow that jerk out the door.

312
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,629
Damn it, I've been drawing
good crowds here!

313
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,547
The fans here, they like me, man!

314
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,300
How many people are we
talkin' about here? 10 to 15,000.

315
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,135
And you're the featured act?
What is this?

316
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:47,929
Now, now, now, wait a minute.

317
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,532
With that kind of a draw, we'd have
to have a guarantee. W-w-w-w-wait...

318
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,034
Now, now, now,
you just wait a minute.

319
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,435
My man gets his own
dressing room. You like that?

320
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,896
Oh, and a piece of the
concessions. Because you see...

321
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:59,023
You! You're outta here!

322
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,650
Just hold on there.

323
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,151
Who is this guy?

324
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:05,238
I like the way you talk.
Go ahead.

325
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,614
Surely. Right.

326
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,703
So, tell me,
does my man have a t-shirt or a shoe deal?

327
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,871
Oh, my god.

328
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,753
Hey, mister. Yeah.

329
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:24,132
I'd like to thank you,
that was a nice thing you did in there.

330
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,008
My pleasure. My name's
Rick. Rick Roberts.

331
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,136
This is niece, Missy.

332
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:31,764
What'd you say your name was? Oh,
uh, Harry Smilac.

333
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,099
Funny. I never heard of you.

334
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:35,435
You never heard of
M. Harry Smilac?

335
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,895
Personal management?

336
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,816
No, no, sorry.

337
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,110
But the way you handled
McMillan back there...

338
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:46,737
You know, that guy has been
playing hardball for a long time.

339
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,989
Ah. You did great.

340
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,116
You gotta know how to handle
guys like that.

341
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,493
Believe me, I've been
negotiating deals for a long time.

342
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:55,163
That guy McMillan,
strictly minor league.

343
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,664
You know what I mean?

344
00:15:56,706 --> 00:16:00,126
You know, I've been looking
for a manager to care about me.

345
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,044
Me first.

346
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,206
You would be interested
in something like that, maybe?

347
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,966
Well, uh, you have to understand,

348
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:09,218
I usually only handle
really big acts.

349
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,761
No offense.

350
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,139
But, you know, major stars.

351
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:16,184
See, I give my people
real personal attention.

352
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,020
That's why I get 15%.

353
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,521
That sounds ok.

354
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:24,066
Well, that's against an advance of,
uh, $500 a week.

355
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,657
Deal. Ah.

356
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,703
Hey, what kind of stuff
you doing these days?

357
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:38,206
Straight rock 'n roll,
heavy metal?

358
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:41,167
You're not new wave,
are you? No.

359
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:42,460
- Oh, well, great.
- Roberts!

360
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,506
Sugarplum, you go to the car.

361
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,216
I wanna know what's going on.

362
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,426
McMillan tells me some
baby freak creep showed up,

363
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:52,845
made a deal for you.
That's right.

364
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,180
What? That's right.

365
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:55,598
You think you're leaving me?

366
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,934
Captain Lou Morano,
the man who made you?

367
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,228
I took you out of nowhere!

368
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,188
Hey, don't touch the Captain.

369
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,940
Now, you listen to me.

370
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,108
No, you listen. We got a deal.

371
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,402
We ain't got no deal on nothing.

372
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,821
I got somebody else
doing my talking for me.

373
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:14,116
You tell me who.
And I'll tear his head off!

374
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,409
Who you sign with? David Wolf?

375
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,536
Jimmy the weasel?

376
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,870
Smilac.

377
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:19,121
Smilac! Smilac! What is that?

378
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,499
A stomach disorder or a disease?

379
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,542
It's my...

380
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,127
Harry.

381
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:29,131
Really it's M. Harry Smilac,
personal management.

382
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,424
At your service.

383
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:38,266
You're kidding.

384
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,685
You... you're a manager?

385
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,270
Yeah. Yeah.

386
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,107
Uh, uh, well, uh,

387
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,025
hey, I'm smokin' this here! Wh...

388
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,069
What I do is, uh...
What I do is...

389
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:51,445
<i>OK, 0k.</i>

390
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,407
Ugh.

391
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,168
You'll regret this,
Roberts! Come on, Harry.

392
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,911
Hey, you got my shoes wet.

393
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,705
Harry, come on.
Yeah, right, I'm coming.

394
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,209
I must be missing something here.

395
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,962
This isn't the way we usually
do things in the music business.

396
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,339
You'll be back, Roberts!

397
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,216
You'll come crawlin'
to the Captain!

398
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:15,219
And that weak manager won't
last a week in professional wrestling!

399
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,221
Professional wrest...

400
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:26,480
Norton's a fabulous man,
I've known him for many years.

401
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:30,276
Harry, where the hell have
you been? I told you 3 o'clock.

402
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,945
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry, Shel, I had to,
uh, bang a few heads together

403
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,405
at the convention center and I...

404
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:35,906
Now, look, they're all waiting.

405
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,408
Now, please, Harry. What?

406
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,290
These people are really important to
the campaign, and to me personally.

407
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:43,247
Ok. I'm counting on you
to make a good impression.

408
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:46,042
I know that I will sleep
a lot better at night

409
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,335
with Norton servicing me...

410
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,755
As governor.

411
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:54,050
Well, but enough about that. I see
that Sheldon's here with his friend.

412
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:57,511
And I'm sure that they have a lot to
tell us about the big fund raiser. Sheldon.

413
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,180
Thank you. Thank you, Bits y.

414
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:04,518
Thank you. I am happy to
introduce you to my friend.

415
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,270
He's been at the
convention center all day

416
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,773
making the arrangements
for the big event.

417
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:12,401
So, Harry, why don't you step
right up here and tell us all about

418
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:14,153
"a night for Norton."

419
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:16,530
Harry Smilac.

420
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,908
No, no, no,
please, please, please.

421
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:20,868
Well,

422
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,370
Norton Wilshire.

423
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:28,125
A special man who
deserves a very special night.

424
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,129
Let me just tell you

425
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,382
some of the entertainers
I have lined up for this.

426
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:39,595
Oh, on second thought,
let it be a surprise, huh?

427
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:42,390
That's all very lovely,
Mr., uh... Smilac.

428
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:45,142
Yes, but... but what plans
have you actually made?

429
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,354
Well, we're not just
talking plans here.

430
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:51,190
We're talking concepts.

431
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:54,318
Videos trying to reach that
all important meat market...

432
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,445
Uh, youth market.

433
00:19:56,487 --> 00:20:00,533
I'm sure we can leave it to the pro
here to handle all the details, huh?

434
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:01,951
We want some details, Harry.

435
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,036
Bits y, darling, uh,
Ross has set up

436
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:05,663
all the artwork in the solarium.

437
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,957
Why don't we all adjourn there
and take a look, ok?

438
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,251
Ladies, shall we?

439
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,877
Have you lost your mind, Sheldon?

440
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,337
This guy's a real bozo.

441
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:14,839
What happened to the circus theme

442
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,674
that we were talking about,

443
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:19,716
where we're all elegantly dressed
for contrast? Don't worry. I'll handle it.

444
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,399
Hi. Hi.

445
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:35,192
May I? Sure.

446
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,695
Uh, forgive me,

447
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,823
but, uh, have you ever
considered a career in modeling?

448
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:43,409
Because I handle
many of the top faces

449
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:46,287
and I think
you have real potential.

450
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,038
As opposed to what?

451
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,790
Unreal potential?

452
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,917
No, no, no.

453
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,961
I mean, you have
such marvelous cheekbones.

454
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:56,797
A-a-a-allow me
to introduce myself.

455
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:00,050
I'm Harry Smilac,
personal management.

456
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,553
As I stand here gazing at you,

457
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:06,223
I can't help but remember
the first time I spotted Christie.

458
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,225
Christie who? Brinkley.

459
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,812
Oh, Christie Brinkley. Yeah,
one of my many finds. Yeah.

460
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:15,608
It was long before Billy Joel.
Still had braces on her teeth.

461
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:18,694
Of course, we had to find a
way to work around that, and...

462
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:21,822
You see, so much
of what shapes a career

463
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:24,492
is in the management,
and that's what I do.

464
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,620
You mean like
this, um, this little event

465
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,539
you're putting on
for Norton Wilshire?

466
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:33,250
Yeah, Oh, it's just a little favor

467
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,669
I'm doing for Bits y
and the swingers.

468
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,463
My mother and her friends.

469
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,925
Oh. You mean, Bits y...

470
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,805
Mrs. Vandervagen to you.

471
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,474
Ah. Right.

472
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:53,479
I'm telling you,
this guy is great.

473
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:55,147
I saw more green last night

474
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:58,192
than I ever saw with the
Captain in my entire career.

475
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:01,654
If you need management,
you need this guy. He's got all the moves.

476
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:04,031
Oh, well, Rick, we all have moves.

477
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:05,616
I mean, yours are in the ring,

478
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:08,327
mine just happen to be
at the bargaining table.

479
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:10,538
Oh, but enough about me.

480
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,957
Tell me something about yourself,
Tom. I mean...

481
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,583
Tonga Tom.

482
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,126
Tonga Tom, right.

483
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,505
I need someone who takes no crap.

484
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:20,589
Tough.

485
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:22,633
Tough, right.

486
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,468
Well, that's me.

487
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,346
Personal management
at its toughest.

488
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,934
Yeah, take your time.

489
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:34,353
But, uh, are you sure it's
all right to sign this guy?

490
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:36,063
I mean, Captain Lou, he...

491
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,274
I'm tellin' you, Harry,
it's 0k, it's ok.

492
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,401
All right, well... nice card.

493
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:43,112
Oh, thanks. Glad you liked it.

494
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:46,490
So, let's, uh, let's talk
about financial arrangements.

495
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:50,202
You see, Tonga, we have something in the,
uh, management business

496
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:53,038
that we call an advance retainer.

497
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,165
Never heard of it.
Of course you haven't.

498
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:59,044
But what it is, you see,
is you give me $500.

499
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,713
And what I do...

500
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:04,216
<i>OK, thank you.</i>

501
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:05,718
Hey, sugarplum. Come on.

502
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:09,054
I need some help. I need a 170
pounds on me. No more, now.

503
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:11,891
You got it? Yep.

504
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,350
Ok, let's do it.

505
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,022
You've got a problem, Roberts.

506
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,524
What might that be?

507
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,693
I hear you left the Captain.

508
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:26,322
So what? The Captain's mad.

509
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,240
That's his problem.
It's not my problem.

510
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,534
It's gonna be yours.

511
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:34,038
Because the Captain doesn't
like when his wrestlers leave.

512
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:38,417
And we don't like it when
the Captain doesn't like it.

513
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,628
And if we don't like it,

514
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,380
you won't like it.

515
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,508
I got a new manager now.

516
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,469
I got somebody else
doin' the talking for me.

517
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,763
And you know
the best part about it is?

518
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:54,808
I don't have to be around
wonderful human beings like yourself.

519
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,562
Axe, can you believe it?

520
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:01,023
3 sentences in a row.

521
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:03,192
The man can actually speak.

522
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:06,820
And all the while,
I thought he was brain-damaged.

523
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:12,576
No.

524
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,036
A check will be fine.

525
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:17,665
As a matter of fact,
I'll pick the check up in person, and...

526
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,542
Oh, no, Tonga,
you don't have to thank me.

527
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:23,003
It's just another Smilac service.

528
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:24,630
It's a deal, Harry. Right.

529
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:26,465
I'll be seeing you later,
brother. Ok.

530
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:28,550
Be cool. Fantastic.

531
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,594
Boy, this is...

532
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:33,639
Oh, hi, guys.
Uh, you lookin' for,

533
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:36,100
for, uh, management?

534
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,726
Is your name simlac?

535
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:40,604
Well, no, actually it's Smilac

536
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:41,730
at your service.

537
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:43,691
We got something for you.

538
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,651
What's that? Pain!

539
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:47,152
And lots of it.

540
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:49,780
Yo!

541
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,657
I hear something about pain?

542
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:53,742
It's the brain-damaged kid!

543
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,746
We'll see you later.

544
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:02,751
Idiots.

545
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:05,379
Uh, wait a minute.
What was that all about?

546
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,047
Ah, nothin'.

547
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:10,259
But friend,
you don't wanna be messin' with them guys.

548
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,344
Mess... they are bad news.

549
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:14,888
Me, mess with them?
What are you, nuts?

550
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,641
I mean, who are those guys,
anyway?

551
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:18,559
Axe and hammer.

552
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,978
The world tag team champs.

553
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:24,314
Huh. Better known
as The Cannibals.

554
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,775
Captain Lou's pride and joy.

555
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:27,985
Wait a minute.

556
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,529
- How much is that?
- 510 pounds.

557
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:38,787
Let me ask you.
What did me mean by, uh,

558
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:40,539
"we'll see you later"?

559
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:45,461
Great, great.

560
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,212
I should have stayed
in the music business.

561
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:05,689
Harry.

562
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,818
Your lawyer assures me
he's sending over a check

563
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,403
to cover all the back payments.

564
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:13,655
Oh, good. Good.
And it better happen, too.

565
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,449
Or else he's back on the job.

566
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:41,308
Count. 1, 2...

567
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:49,191
All right.

568
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:58,617
Hold onto him.

569
00:26:58,659 --> 00:26:59,699
Get him over here and tag.

570
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:24,768
Grab him! Grab him!
No! Slam! Slam!

571
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:43,620
1,2,3!

572
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:53,213
Ladies and gentlemen!

573
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:55,883
The winners of
tonight's main event,

574
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,010
and america's newest tag team,

575
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:00,846
together for the first time ever,

576
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:02,973
Quick Rick Roberts and Tonga Tom!

577
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,232
All right.

578
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:15,694
Fantastic, guys, fantastic!

579
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:18,197
Great teamwork, just great!

580
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,741
There's just a couple of little
things that we need to work on.

581
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:23,452
Nothing major,
nothing we can't fix, but, uh,

582
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,412
wait a minute.
You're not hurt, are you?

583
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:27,414
Never felt better in my life,
Harry. Great.

584
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:30,292
Now, look, Rick, you gotta,
you gotta tighten up on the, uh...

585
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:31,919
Arm bar. Right.

586
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,214
Oh, and listen, we have to...
Have to talk about outfits.

587
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:38,842
You know, I mean, my wrestlers
have gotta have style.

588
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,594
I mean, after all...

589
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:42,387
Oh, wait... wait a minute here.

590
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,431
Maybe I can talk to Nike
about a tie-in.

591
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:45,807
Vic Carson.

592
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:48,393
Vic Carson?
Who's that, another wrestler?

593
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,437
Because you know, I'm...
Vic Carson, Harry.

594
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:52,981
Has another talk show on T.V.

595
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:54,483
T.V.? Right.

596
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,902
Oh, you mean Johnny Carson?

597
00:28:56,944 --> 00:29:00,322
No, Vic Carson.
Host of ring talk.

598
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:02,157
You don't realize, Harry. What?

599
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:05,786
You're a new manager. You've
created a stir second to none.

600
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,829
They want you down there
this Wednesday.

601
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:10,749
Well, you know, I'd have
to check on my calendar.

602
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,085
I mean, I'm... I'm booked
pretty tight here, you know.

603
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,504
Well, I understand
if you're not interested.

604
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:16,945
It's the #1 talk show
on television.

605
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,174
Right.

606
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:21,635
Uh, wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute here.

607
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:23,762
What... what night was that?

608
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:27,182
Wednesday night. Oh, Wednesday night,
I'm free on Wednesday.

609
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,561
Tonight, from Hollywood,
California,

610
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,398
it's ring talk, america's
favorite wrestling program,

611
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,608
with your host, Vic Carson.

612
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,989
Now, here's Vic!

613
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,407
T #

614
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,825
Oh, thank you!

615
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,243
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

616
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:48,036
Welcome, wrestling fans,
thank you.

617
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:50,455
Well, we have a wonderful
crowd tonight.

618
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,374
Thank you!

619
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:55,294
Ladies and gentlemen,

620
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:58,380
tonight, we're gonna begin
our show with a special segment.

621
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:01,925
That's right.
Devoted to wrestling managers.

622
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:05,012
And we have right here in this
ring the finest in the business.

623
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:08,015
I've got an old pro,
I've got a specialist,

624
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,391
and I've got a newcomer,

625
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:11,727
and we're gonna learn just
what their approaches are.

626
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,937
Let we welcome my first guest,
ladies and gentlemen.

627
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:16,982
This man has done more
for the rubber industry

628
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:18,400
than good year.

629
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:22,029
Ladies and gentlemen,
the fantastic Captain Lou Morano!

630
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:31,246
Lou, you are undoubtedly

631
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:33,957
the most outstanding
and successful manager

632
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:35,751
in the wrestling game.

633
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,313
May I say, I am so honored to have
you on the show. Ah, it's your pleasure.

634
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:42,174
Thank you. And my next
guest is a giant in his own right.

635
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:46,011
Ladies and gentlemen,
the magnificent Tim Mcclusky!

636
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,096
Hey! Here!

637
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,810
Welcome to the show, Tim.

638
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:57,064
Now, Tim handles the smaller
wrestlers in the business.

639
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,816
And I know, Tim,
that my viewers are very anxious to hear

640
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,777
the long and the short of it.

641
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:04,946
No more midget jokes,
geekface, or I'll deck you!

642
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,115
Tim, you are a card.

643
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:09,951
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
my last guest.

644
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:12,746
Wrestling's newest manager,
direct from the music business.

645
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:16,625
Let's have a big warm welcome
for Mr. Harry Smilac!

646
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,293
Ladies and gentleman,
Harry Smilac.

647
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:24,383
Such a pleasure
being on your show, Vic.

648
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,926
I can't tell you...
Thank you, Harry.

649
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,762
Welcome to the show. May
I say that this is stunning.

650
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:30,097
Ah, thank you. I...

651
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,099
But, gentleman,
we only have an hour,

652
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,810
so let's everybody
just take a stool.

653
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:35,936
T #

654
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,481
So, Vic...

655
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:42,609
Get up from there! What
you... what you doin' there?

656
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,111
Hey! Hey! Hey!

657
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:48,990
You short little midget, you!

658
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,992
That was my seat!

659
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,829
Well, I suppose that
the natural place to start

660
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:56,373
would be with our newcomer here.

661
00:31:56,415 --> 00:32:00,001
Harry, what made you forsake the
music industry for professional wrestling?

662
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:04,005
Oh, well, uh, let me correct you there,
Vic, baby, if I may.

663
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,925
See, I still manage many, many,
many famous music groups,

664
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:08,718
I just sort of, oh,

665
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,846
branched out into
uh, the wrestling world.

666
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:13,056
Because there's
such a desperate need

667
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:14,641
for good, really good managers.

668
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:17,310
So it is your opinion, Harry,
that there is a shortage

669
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,438
of mangers in
the wrestling profession?

670
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,857
Uh, well, not necessarily a sh...

671
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,984
Ah, don't!

672
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,153
I mean, wrestling needs
someone with new ideas,

673
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,029
someone with new approaches,

674
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:30,574
someone who isn't all tied up
in the old way of doing things.

675
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,993
Well, you certainly don't mean
any of the old pros

676
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,120
that are on our show here
tonight, do you, Harry?

677
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:36,997
Well, if the shoe fits.

678
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,040
If you're talkin' about me,
butt face,

679
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,351
I'll break your neck.
Do you mind?

680
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,544
Captain,
what is your response to all of this?

681
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:45,505
I don't give a rat's ass about
anything this moron has to say!

682
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,966
This pencil-neck's been
in the business 2 minutes,

683
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:49,342
and he thinks he knows everything.

684
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,219
He's an idiot! He's a... faggot.

685
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:53,555
Yeah, everybody knows
these musical sorts

686
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:55,515
are into all sorts of
strange stuff! Really?

687
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:57,184
They don't belong
in a red-blooded,

688
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,560
all-American sport like wrestling!

689
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:00,854
We don't need wimps
in funny-looking clothes

690
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:02,314
telling us how to run
our business!

691
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,523
We don't need... faggots.

692
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:04,691
Yeah, Tim.

693
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:06,526
We want this beanie-bag
out of wrestling!

694
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:08,987
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

695
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:11,698
I gotta admit, Vic,
I'm new to the sport.

696
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,658
Let me tell you what I've learned.

697
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,244
Wrestlers need a new deal.

698
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:20,248
Yes, sir. Because they're the talent,
they deserve the bucks.

699
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,125
By the way,
uh, wrestlers out there,

700
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:25,253
my number is 213-555-1334. So...

701
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:28,715
Wait a minute! H-H-Hold it,
wrestling fans!

702
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:32,135
Now, those are mighty strong
words to the old vicar here,

703
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:35,639
and I'm sure the Captain has some
mighty strong words in response.

704
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,600
But before we hear from the Captain,
let's have this message.

705
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,650
You know damn well
I'm the Captain.

706
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,127
Why, I'm the best manager
of all time.

707
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,903
Man, you ain't done!
Who you talkin' to?

708
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:55,075
What the hell?

709
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,459
3,2,1.

710
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:06,127
We're back, wrestling fans.

711
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,754
As Harry was say...

712
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:08,922
Where's Harry?

713
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:12,008
Oh, Vic.

714
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:16,555
Let me assure you, ladies,
everything is under control.

715
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:19,891
I have been in touch
with so many stars

716
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:22,686
that they are coming out of... uh,
Harry. The names, please.

717
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,815
All right.
Big names. They're big.

718
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,233
Uh, that would be good, yeah.

719
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:31,319
We're talking, uh, Frank,

720
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:34,281
Neil, uh, Barbara, Julio,

721
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,407
uh, I could go on.

722
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:38,118
Oh, this is gonna be
the most fabulous show!

723
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,411
Yeah.

724
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:41,162
Oh, yeah, what else!

725
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:52,048
Nice rear end.

726
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,551
I beg your pardon?

727
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:56,803
Well, uh, they don't, uh,

728
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:58,972
they don't make 'em
like this anymore, huh?

729
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:01,308
Oh. Hmm. Great body, huh?

730
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:03,310
Mmm-hmm. Solid.

731
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:06,271
Yeah, it's my mother's. I'm
using it while mine's in the shop.

732
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:07,606
What...

733
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,399
Oh, no, this is nothing.

734
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:11,526
I... I'll be all right.
Can I give you a hand?

735
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,820
May I?

736
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:15,739
Yeah.

737
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,241
Are you always such a gentleman?

738
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:21,369
Well, your beauty
brings out the best in me.

739
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:23,413
God, you sound like a soap opera.

740
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,165
Oh, you questioning my sincerity?

741
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,666
And your integrity.

742
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:30,295
And maybe your decency
and certainly your ability

743
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:32,339
to get the entertainment
for the fund raiser.

744
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:36,134
Hmm. Well, I'm working under
some very difficult circumstances here.

745
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:39,763
Tell me. What could be so difficult
about getting a little entertainment?

746
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,724
I could get entertainers to
appear at a P.L.O. fund raiser

747
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:45,018
before they'd help out
Norton Wilshire, you know.

748
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,645
Why won't you trust me, huh?

749
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:49,981
I'm really a very nice person.

750
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:51,107
Hmm?

751
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,110
Opening a gate and
picking up a few packages

752
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:57,364
does not necessarily
qualify you as a nice person.

753
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,449
Hmm. How about dinner?

754
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:02,160
Oh, no. No, I don't think so.

755
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:03,578
Uh, lunch?

756
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,872
I don't eat lunch.
In-between-meal snack?

757
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:07,415
My dentist wouldn't approve.

758
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:09,000
Well, bring him along.

759
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:11,211
Huh? Strictly business.

760
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:14,172
We can go over the lighting and
sound system for the Wilshire event.

761
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:17,759
Look, we'll go to a very noisy,
unromantic spot.

762
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:20,387
You can even drive.

763
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:23,098
T #

764
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:29,062
Well, thank you.

765
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:40,073
Well, you're really
on your best behavior.

766
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:42,867
Of course. What did you expect?

767
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,953
I won't tell you.

768
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:47,914
Well, I admit,
the first time I met you,

769
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:50,458
I, uh, I might have
come on a little strong.

770
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,460
A little strong?

771
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:55,338
Does that "I'm gonna make
you a star" routine really work?

772
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:57,799
Nah.

773
00:36:57,841 --> 00:36:59,384
You know, I was just...

774
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:03,054
Seeing someone
as beautiful as you,

775
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:05,640
my mouth went on automatic pilot.

776
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:09,602
Well, I think your sincere
approach is a lot nicer.

777
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:10,770
Really.

778
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:12,230
Approach?

779
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:14,691
Wait a minute. You think
I'm coming on to you now?

780
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,443
Probably.

781
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,653
Stiffed on car payments
by some creepo?

782
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:20,321
Call the folks at reliable repo!

783
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:28,788
Oh! Oh!

784
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,915
Are... are you all right?
Oh, I don't...

785
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:33,460
Does that really hurt? Oh, yeah.

786
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:34,603
It gets worse at night, too.

787
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:38,298
I mean, sometimes
the pain is so intense...

788
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,550
I wonder, could you
drop me at my place?

789
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:42,177
I'm afraid to drive.

790
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,846
If I had an attack
behind the wheel, I...

791
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:47,390
What... what are you gonna do
about your car?

792
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:50,351
I don't know. I'll just
have to get it later. I think...

793
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,353
The best thing right now is just,

794
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,481
to get, you know, into bed.

795
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:17,212
I sure appreciate this. Ow!

796
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:21,257
Harry!

797
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,467
Oh, my... my... ow!

798
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:23,676
Harry!

799
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,678
A spasm or something!

800
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,430
Oh, my god, are you 0k?

801
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:30,183
Oh, oh!

802
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:31,559
Oh, you know... are you ok?

803
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:35,146
I think instead of bed,

804
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:38,691
what we... I should do
is take a jacuzzi.

805
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,568
Do you suppose you could...

806
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:41,653
Sure, sure.

807
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:45,281
Oh, smirac.

808
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,450
Mr. Smirac, we meet again.

809
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:51,287
Did you screw over
someone else, too?

810
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,516
Look, Mr. Kim,
don't you guys have anything better to do

811
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:57,085
than hassle me over
some small consumer loan?

812
00:38:57,126 --> 00:39:02,048
$67,811.19 is not
a small consumer loan.

813
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:05,176
Excuse me. How about you
fellas taking this up in the morning?

814
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:07,804
You know,
during business hours? Yes.

815
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:10,765
In Korea, females do not
interfere in such matters.

816
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:13,476
I beg your pardon, but it...

817
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:16,521
Oh, that... that's all right,
Candace, I'll handle this.

818
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:18,857
Handle this? You're in no
condition to handle anything.

819
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:21,401
I know, but... Mr. Smirac,
I'm losing my Patience.

820
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,444
You pay or n0 DEV?

821
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:24,779
Watch my lips...

822
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,031
Watch my friends.

823
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:33,246
Oh. My god! Harry!

824
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:41,588
That's my mother's car!

825
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:42,672
Oh, my god!

826
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,929
Oh, my... look, Candace,
it's not so bad.

827
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:53,558
I... I think you can write
this kind of thing off. Really.

828
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,602
If not, I know a good body man.

829
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:03,443
I don't care
what you say, Sheldon,

830
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,111
I want him off this committee.

831
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:08,907
I never want to see him again.
And you stay away from him, too.

832
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:11,284
Mother, I think
you're overreacting.

833
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:12,911
It was not Harry's fault.

834
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:15,079
It most certainly was his fault.

835
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:17,081
I think he deserves
another chance.

836
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:19,876
Look, Bits y, if we fire Harry now,
who will we get to replace him?

837
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:21,669
It's too late
to find anybody else.

838
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:23,463
That's your problem.

839
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,173
All right. Tell you what.

840
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,550
Suppose I supervise him
personally?

841
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:30,637
Believe me, I'll watch every
move the man makes like a hawk.

842
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:33,222
Ok. Fine.

843
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:36,267
You got it. Nice puppy.

844
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,146
Cute.

845
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:46,235
T #

846
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:49,238
# Live on the brink,
shout it out loud #

847
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:52,659
# it's the American way #

848
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,953
# yeah, yeah #

849
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:57,747
Nice car.

850
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,249
Nice ass.

851
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,754
# It's the American way #

852
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,339
# yeah, yeah II

853
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,223
Hello, Harry.

854
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:18,267
How ya doin', Chris?
Hey, that is a chartbuster!

855
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,853
Definitely top 40, maybe gold.

856
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,563
Maybe platinum!

857
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:25,108
Harry, we know our stuff is great.

858
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,818
What we need is management help.

859
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:29,779
Yeah, like somebody
who will pay us,

860
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:31,656
instead of the other way around.

861
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:34,075
Guys, you wound me!

862
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:37,996
What do you think is the number
one thing on M. Harry Smilac's mind?

863
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,789
M. Harry Smilac.

864
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:42,583
No, no, no, no, no.
The future of Kicks!

865
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,794
That's what. You know,
I never stop thinking,

866
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:46,671
day and night, night and day,

867
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:50,258
thinking of ways
to make you guys famous.

868
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,260
Harry, bottom line.

869
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:54,345
Do we have a gig, or don't we?

870
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:56,723
Well, uh, you might as well
start thanking me now

871
00:41:56,764 --> 00:42:00,727
because I am working
on a major, but major gig.

872
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:04,731
Oh, but enough
of this success talk, huh?

873
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:07,734
Come on, let me hear some of
the new numbers. What do you say?

874
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,694
I want to hear a little
more about the gig.

875
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:13,614
Oh, Todd, baby,
come on. Trust me.

876
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:16,200
The last time we trusted you
we played a dairy queen opening.

877
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,535
True, but, uh...

878
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:19,912
Come on, we gotta practice anyway.

879
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:22,707
Listen, this is really gonna
put Kicks on the map!

880
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:37,013
Thanks again for bringing me. Mom,
this is so exciting.

881
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:39,766
Seeing all these stars
on one stage!

882
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:42,935
Well, darling, that's the only
reason your father coughed up $500

883
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,687
for a putz like Wilshire.

884
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,691
Uh, Harry.

885
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,820
Well, you, uh,
you pulled it off, right?

886
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:54,864
Did you ever doubt it? Huh?

887
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:58,117
Yes. Especially the way you've been
avoiding me the last couple of days.

888
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:01,662
Shelly, Shelly,
you know me better than that.

889
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,331
What, are you kidding?

890
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:05,583
Look, uh,
my job is done, ok? So...

891
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:07,061
They're all backstage,
right? I mean,

892
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:09,087
Frank, Barbara, Julio...

893
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,631
Don't worry, Shel,
it's gonna be a super show.

894
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:14,133
Yeah, but I just want to,
you know, straighten out...

895
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:15,843
Isn't this our dear
little friend Larry?

896
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:17,720
Harry, mother.

897
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:20,681
Yes, dear. I hope he's better at
stars than he is at Rolls-Royces.

898
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:23,476
Have you met our senator?
Norton Wilshire.

899
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:26,562
I want to thank you
for your assistance

900
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,731
and dedication to our campaign.

901
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:31,943
It's the workers like you and
Sheldon here who make it possible...

902
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:33,861
Oh, that's enough.
That's enough.

903
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:37,281
For men like me to serve in
high public office... Don't go away.

904
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:39,867
I've been, uh, thinking
about our relationship.

905
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:42,954
What relationship?

906
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:45,790
Uh, well, the one
we should be having.

907
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:47,792
Yes, in fact, I was thinking

908
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:50,294
that we should
get out of here right now

909
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:52,255
and start working on it.

910
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,674
And miss "a night with Norton?"

911
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:59,720
Yeah, well, I'm more interested
in a night with Candace.

912
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:03,224
I gotta hand it to you, Harry,
you just don't quit.

913
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:05,143
Hmm. The secret to my success.

914
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:09,188
No more Koreans? I promise.

915
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,733
Well, then, let's go.

916
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,902
Harry, Harry,
where are you going? Harry!

917
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:21,284
Wow, what a night, huh?

918
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:24,287
Oh, ladies and gentlemen,
I know that you can't wait to hear

919
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:27,707
from our favorite senator,
Norton Wilshire, right?

920
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:33,880
Uh, well, then, I guess we better,
uh, get right on

921
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,882
to our fabulous
entertainment first.

922
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:40,928
Who do you think will be
first? Frank or Barbara?

923
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,055
Julio.

924
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,099
Hmm.

925
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:57,737
T #

926
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,244
Oh, my god!

927
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:06,287
Oh!

928
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:11,959
Oh!

929
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:15,922
Sheldon!

930
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,299
Hello, this is M. Harry Smilac.

931
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:20,801
I'll be in Rio de Janeiro
for the next year or so,

932
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:23,012
but if you want, at the tone,
leave a message.

933
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,307
Harry, you better
make an appointment

934
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:27,892
with a plastic surgeon,

935
00:45:27,934 --> 00:45:30,770
because if anyone sees your face,
you're a dead man.

936
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,438
Harry, it's Candace.

937
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,898
Wherever you're hiding,
stay there,

938
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,608
because mother's ready to kill.

939
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:38,277
Yo, lady!

940
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:39,987
The powder room's down the hall.

941
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:41,489
Right. Look, Missy,

942
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:44,408
if Bits y Vandervagen
or Sheldon Brockmeister call,

943
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:45,910
I'm not here, all right?

944
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:49,830
Sounds like Harry.
Don't look like Harry.

945
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,374
Now, look, guys,

946
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:54,085
there's a very good explanation
why I'm dressed like this.

947
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:55,920
Sure. Sure there is
and I'd love to tell ya,

948
00:45:55,962 --> 00:45:57,838
but we've got a wrestling
match in 5 minutes,

949
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,882
so come on, let's go, huh?

950
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:02,134
What, you wanna take a picture,
you two? Come on.

951
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,594
Harry, do you want your messages?

952
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:04,845
No.

953
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:06,889
Yeah, who called?

954
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:08,516
Well, your lawyer called.

955
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:11,978
He was really mad. He said they had to
give back all the money from last night.

956
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,229
Yeah? Who else?

957
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:15,856
The band "Kicks" called.

958
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:18,651
They weren't too happy either.
Also...

959
00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:20,528
Wait a minute.
You mean, there's more?

960
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:21,696
Yeah. Who?

961
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,048
Senator Norton Wilshire called...

962
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:24,907
Oh, no! Don't tell me,
don't tell me. I...

963
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:28,911
Uh, Roberts, Tonga,
you're on. Uh...

964
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:30,663
You, uh,

965
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:32,581
you want me to get a seat
for the lady?

966
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,835
No, thank you.

967
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:40,589
From Evanston, Illinois,
america's heartland,

968
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,718
Quick Rick Roberts!

969
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:47,305
And his partner,

970
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:50,182
from that magical
south seas kingdom of Tonga,

971
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,393
Tonga Tom!

972
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:54,395
Hello, everybody, I'm Chick Hearn,

973
00:46:54,437 --> 00:46:57,023
along with Jay Johnstone,
ready for tonight's big match.

974
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,418
I don't know about you,
but I'm really looking forward to this

975
00:46:59,442 --> 00:47:01,569
because since they merged
as a tag team,

976
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,672
Quick Rick and Tonga have been very,
very impressive.

977
00:47:03,696 --> 00:47:05,614
In fact, I think
they could go all the way.

978
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:07,199
Well, they shouldn't
have any trouble

979
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:09,076
with their opponents tonight,
the invaders.

980
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:11,871
We've had a substitution
on the card.

981
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:14,623
In place of the invaders,
we have <i>2</i> new opponents.

982
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,376
We have,

983
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:20,671
a combined weight of 580 pounds...

984
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:27,011
Axe and Hammer, The Cannibals!

985
00:47:27,053 --> 00:47:28,262
Wait a minute!

986
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:31,932
They can't do that!

987
00:47:37,063 --> 00:47:39,899
All right, Roberts!
You're gonna pay tonight!

988
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,650
Hold it! Hold it! Stop!

989
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,910
Excuse me! Hey!

990
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,954
Come on, let's get in!
Here we go! Come on!

991
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:03,464
We're ready, now get in here!

992
00:48:03,506 --> 00:48:06,801
I wanna tell you, Jay, it looks like
there's real trouble brewing here.

993
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,677
And when the Captain's
doing the brewing,

994
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,471
you know it's gonna be
a bad cup of coffee.

995
00:48:10,513 --> 00:48:12,181
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

996
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:14,350
What's going on here?
We didn't agree to this!

997
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:16,102
We're not goin' through
with it! Ok? Harry!

998
00:48:17,478 --> 00:48:19,063
Or should I call you Harriet?

999
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:21,190
This is for you!

1000
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:23,442
You're out of wrestling
tonight, Smilac!

1001
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:26,112
And so are your <i>2</i> bums!

1002
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:28,906
Anybody milked you lately,
huh? Come on, idiot.

1003
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,868
Ow!

1004
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:36,831
Oh, there goes the referee! And
they come over with their chains!

1005
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:38,999
I got a canary with a
bigger brain than yours!

1006
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:45,089
You cannot control
animals like this,

1007
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:46,882
particularly when they're armed

1008
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,676
with lethal weapons
such as chains.

1009
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:50,094
Tonga!

1010
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:52,972
Ugh!

1011
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:56,100
You son of a...

1012
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:58,352
Aren't you supposed
to be in there? Come on!

1013
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,062
Tonga!

1014
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:05,818
You can run, sweetie,
but you can't hide!

1015
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:17,163
Well, that's really nice,
Captain Lou,

1016
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:19,999
come over while he's half-unconscious
and kick him in the head.

1017
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:23,836
Meanwhile, in the ring, they're beating
ferociously upon the body of Quick Rick!

1018
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:26,088
I don't know if the kid
can take this or not!

1019
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,549
Certainly, no human is
supposed to take beatings like this,

1020
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:30,968
not in the ring,
not anywhere in the world!

1021
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,308
Ladies and gentlemen,
they've got him half unconscious now!

1022
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:41,103
Oh, they catch him with a necktie
with that chain! Can you believe this?

1023
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:45,149
Come on! Let's go! Ok!
Give me a little hand!

1024
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:47,151
Here you go! Over the top!

1025
00:49:47,193 --> 00:49:49,987
Oh, fans, this goes back
to the neanderthal days!

1026
00:49:50,029 --> 00:49:52,573
I don't believe this!
They've gotta stop it,

1027
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:55,159
somebody's just gotta
stop this match!

1028
00:49:55,201 --> 00:49:58,120
Tonga's trying to get ready to come
back. He'll just get hurt some more!

1029
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:00,831
He dives! He misses his man!

1030
00:50:00,873 --> 00:50:02,833
Look at the blood
on that kid's chest!

1031
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:07,087
Look at the kid's face!
He's in excruciating pain!

1032
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:10,132
Now they lift him up
onto the top rope, face down,

1033
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:11,759
dangle his feet there,

1034
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,427
The Hammer supports him
from the cuff,

1035
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:16,555
coming off the top buckle,
here comes Axe!

1036
00:50:16,597 --> 00:50:19,099
This is gonna be
big trouble, fans!

1037
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:22,770
It's illegal! Oh, god,
that's a paralyzing blow!

1038
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:26,774
Look out, here comes, oh,
the double elbow! A double elbow!

1039
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:29,151
Even this capacity crowd
wants this thing stopped!

1040
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:30,778
They paid their money,
that's true,

1041
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:33,906
but they don't want to see
these animals in action anymore!

1042
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:36,200
Somebody's gotta stop this!
Where's the police?

1043
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:37,993
Somebody, anybody!
You're absolutely right!

1044
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:39,870
The gendarmes have
gotta step in here!

1045
00:50:39,912 --> 00:50:42,498
This is setting wrestling
back a thousand years!

1046
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:43,916
There you 9°!

1047
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:46,293
Oh! Did you see that?

1048
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:49,880
This could be the demise
of Quick Rick and Tonga Tom!

1049
00:50:49,922 --> 00:50:52,675
All right, all right,
all right, right now!

1050
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:56,136
Ladies and gentlemen,

1051
00:50:58,264 --> 00:51:00,099
you don't like it, Harry?

1052
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,434
This is illegal! Wait! Wait! Wait! No,
wait!

1053
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:08,315
Oh, they're gonna
send him on a trip!

1054
00:51:08,357 --> 00:51:11,277
Just a sec... no! No! Please!

1055
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:24,331
Be right back, 0k? Sit tight.

1056
00:51:24,373 --> 00:51:25,374
Uh-huh.

1057
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,309
Hey, Smilac!

1058
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:46,395
Oh, no! No, wait!

1059
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,315
Wait, pl...

1060
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:51,358
Oh! Oh, oh, oh...

1061
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,503
Oh, I'm sorry,
I didn't... I didn't see... oh, oh, oh.

1062
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:55,154
Oh, my goodness.

1063
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:56,697
Are you... you all right?

1064
00:51:56,739 --> 00:51:58,240
Fine.

1065
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:01,327
Ok. Well, get well soon, huh?

1066
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,537
Uh-oh.

1067
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:05,748
Oh...

1068
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:06,790
Oh...

1069
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:09,543
No!

1070
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:24,183
On, poor guy!

1071
00:52:26,185 --> 00:52:28,354
Well, at least
he's close to the hospital.

1072
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:30,773
"No, you don't!

1073
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:32,858
"We will stop you no matter what!

1074
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,569
"You will never stop me,
Captain chaos,

1075
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:37,905
because I have
the secret formula!"

1076
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:40,366
Oh, no!

1077
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:42,159
I bet they'll get it back.

1078
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:47,748
Hey, Harry.

1079
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:49,625
Hi, Harry. Hi, Harry.

1080
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:51,460

-
I, guys. Missy.

1081
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:53,337
How'd you like the fight?

1082
00:52:53,379 --> 00:52:54,463
Ah, well, you know...

1083
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,925
I'll tell you, guys, I...

1084
00:52:57,966 --> 00:52:59,343
I feel real bad.

1085
00:52:59,385 --> 00:53:01,512
You look pretty bad, too.

1086
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,555
Oh, no, no, I mean, I...

1087
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:06,016
I let you down. I blew it.

1088
00:53:06,058 --> 00:53:08,268
Aw. Harry, go on!

1089
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:11,897
It wasn't your fault.
We just got our butts kicked.

1090
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:15,234
I mean, you guys have been
wrestling a lot of years,

1091
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:17,361
nothing like this
ever happened before.

1092
00:53:17,403 --> 00:53:21,532
This whole thing happened
because the Captain outsmarted me.

1093
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:23,909
We just got off to a bad start.

1094
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:25,369
You didn't finish
too well, either.

1095
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:29,373
Don't worry, Harry.
We'll get 'em next time.

1096
00:53:29,415 --> 00:53:32,376
There won't be a next time.
Not for me.

1097
00:53:32,418 --> 00:53:33,877
Why not?

1098
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:37,715
Well,

1099
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:42,219
'cause it, uh, doesn't feel too good having
people I like get hurt on my account.

1100
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:46,223
So, uh,

1101
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:49,351
well, I never thought
I'd hear myself say this,

1102
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,482
you guys...

1103
00:53:55,524 --> 00:53:57,401
You need another manager.

1104
00:53:57,443 --> 00:53:59,445
Here's your contracts.

1105
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:01,405
Harry, wait a second!

1106
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:04,158
I thought we were doing
great! Come back here!

1107
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:07,369
Hi, Harry, how you doin'?

1108
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:08,412
Hi, har.

1109
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:21,592
M. Harry Smilac,
personal manager, I do believe.

1110
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:24,261
What are you doing here?

1111
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:26,513
Oh, I'm just looking
for my manager.

1112
00:54:26,555 --> 00:54:28,599
I thought I told you
to get somebody else.

1113
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:31,727
Harry, you're my man.

1114
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:34,146
I don't want nobody else,
you're the best.

1115
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:36,231
Well,

1116
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:37,649
I used to believe that.

1117
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:40,360
Not anymore.

1118
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:42,905
You know, Harry,
you stood up to the Captain.

1119
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:46,450
If you get out of wrestling,

1120
00:54:46,492 --> 00:54:49,286
do you know that anybody that
makes it in wrestling from now on

1121
00:54:49,328 --> 00:54:50,996
is gonna be
one of the Captain's men?

1122
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:55,751
Rick, you're wastin'
your time, all right?

1123
00:54:55,793 --> 00:54:58,462
You know, there's only <i>2</i> things
in my life that matters, Harry.

1124
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:02,883
That's wrestling,
and my little Princess,

1125
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:05,344
little missy.

1126
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:07,989
And I'll tell you what made that
all possible. It's wrestling, Harry.

1127
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:11,391
Wrestling made that possible.
And I'll tell you somethin',

1128
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:14,019
if you're gonna quit on me
and I've gotta go back

1129
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:16,021
to lickin' the Captain's boots,

1130
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:18,148
well, mister,
you know what I'm gonna do?

1131
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,901
I'm gonna be just like you,
I'm gonna quit, too.

1132
00:55:20,943 --> 00:55:24,071
Rick, even if I wanted to,
which I don't,

1133
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:25,447
but even if I wanted to,

1134
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:30,244
I couldn't book us a match
in a major arena anywhere.

1135
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:32,746
No one's gonna sign with us if
it means bucking the Captain.

1136
00:55:34,623 --> 00:55:37,543
You mean to tell me there's not
one single arena in the country

1137
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:39,878
that doesn't
kiss up to the Captain?

1138
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,505
Not a major arena.

1139
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:43,966
I mean, maybe some 2-bit place

1140
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:47,511
like my bands used to play
when I was just starting out.

1141
00:55:47,553 --> 00:55:48,804
You know, road tours...

1142
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:03,610
That is really dumb.

1143
00:56:03,652 --> 00:56:05,195
Dumb? Come on! This could...

1144
00:56:05,237 --> 00:56:07,573
This could... this could
be very good for you.

1145
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:09,408
Major publicity!

1146
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:11,618
Yeah, like the Wilshire fund raiser,
right, Harry?

1147
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:14,538
My parents, to this day,
won't speak to me.

1148
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:16,373
They think I'm a communist agent.

1149
00:56:16,415 --> 00:56:19,501
Look, I think this could
be very good for you.

1150
00:56:19,543 --> 00:56:21,795
Now, what do you say
we give it a try, huh?

1151
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:26,216
See, I can promote concerts for you guys,
book matches for my wrestlers.

1152
00:56:26,258 --> 00:56:29,553
Come on, come on. Look, give me
a couple of weeks to put it together,

1153
00:56:29,595 --> 00:56:32,431
then if you're not happy,

1154
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:35,267
you can find yourselves
another manager. Hmm?

1155
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:38,770
Hey, Harry, are you ok?
You seem sincere.

1156
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:41,648
I mean every word of it.

1157
00:56:43,609 --> 00:56:45,110
I'll be right back.

1158
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:51,033
You know, guys,
I think he really means it this time.

1159
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:53,327
We've heard this story
time and time again.

1160
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:56,371
Maybe he's on the level,
maybe he's not.

1161
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,498
I'll even provide
first-class transportation!

1162
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:04,630
"First-class transportation."

1163
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:08,008
Meals, too.

1164
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:14,139
T #

1165
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:21,313
# The sun comes up #

1166
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:23,148

00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:31,114

# Push! Push! #

1177
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:00,686
# Oh, you can do it, baby #

1178
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:02,980
# I said, push! Push! #

1179
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:04,648
# I know you can do it, baby N'

1180
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:14,741
Elmo, you can't do this to me.

1181
00:58:14,783 --> 00:58:16,576
I've got posters up all over town,

1182
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:19,830
advertising <i>2</i> different shows
on <i>2</i> different nights.

1183
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:21,873
Look, I'd... I'd
like to help you,

1184
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:25,419
but we're booked up solid. You
got the 15th, 4-h has got the 16th.

1185
00:58:27,129 --> 00:58:29,381
Well, look, how about
right after the 4-h, huh?

1186
00:58:29,423 --> 00:58:31,425
I mean,
farmers go to bed early, right?

1187
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:33,719
No, that's the hog auction.

1188
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,888
That's a wild one. They
don't finish up till about 9:00.

1189
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:40,684
Then we gotta pick up all the
droppings and then air the place out.

1190
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:42,686
Elmo! Elmo, pal,

1191
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:45,814
look, I'd be real grateful

1192
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:48,191
if you could find a way
to move the pig act.

1193
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:50,569
I mean, I'm sure the pigs
won't mind, right?

1194
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:53,030
Well, we could call it
a clerical error.

1195
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:55,532
Well, you might call it that,

1196
00:58:55,574 --> 00:58:58,285
but, you see, my partner wouldn't.

1197
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:08,628
Oh, Elmo, Elmo, Elmo.

1198
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:12,799
Come on, I've posted $1000
guarantee. I've got musicians to pay.

1199
00:59:12,841 --> 00:59:16,011
What am I gonna do
with only one night?

1200
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:18,013
Well, you know,
my daddy used to say,

1201
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:21,850
if you only got $10 and you're
goin' down to the cathouse,

1202
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:24,061
you better get the most bang
for the buck.

1203
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:27,355
You get it? Bang for the buck?

1204
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,691
That's a good one!

1205
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:35,530
I'm gonna have to run down and tell
Floyd and the boys at the barbershop!

1206
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:36,990
Bang for the buck!

1207
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:42,370
Bang for the buck.

1208
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:47,125
Wait a minute.

1209
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:48,585
Bang, buck.

1210
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:18,198
Now, uh, remember,
rock and wrestling all in the same night.

1211
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,784
Yeah, rock and wrestling.
Let's go!

1212
01:00:20,826 --> 01:00:21,910
Yeah!

1213
01:00:30,794 --> 01:00:33,130
T #

1214
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:43,515
# Push! Push! #

1215
01:00:43,557 --> 01:00:45,308
# I know you can do it, baby #

1216
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,644
# I said, push! Push! #

1217
01:00:47,686 --> 01:00:49,312
# I know you can do it, baby #

1218
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:51,648
# I said push! Push! #

1219
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:53,150
# I know you can do it, baby #

1220
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:55,527
# I said, push! Push! #

1221
01:00:55,569 --> 01:00:57,279
# I know you can do it, baby #

1222
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,780
# I said push! N'

1223
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:15,672
Whoa, whoa!

1224
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:18,508
Thank you!

1225
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:21,845
We got a real Hummer for
you tonight at the rock concert,

1226
01:01:21,887 --> 01:01:24,097
and we've gonna have now,
the wrestling match!

1227
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:27,559
T #

1228
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:29,769
Now, tomorrow night, don't forget,

1229
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:32,022
we got the big hog auction.

1230
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:33,857
And then the next night
we got the...

1231
01:01:33,899 --> 01:01:35,734
Now, that's terrific, Elmo.

1232
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:38,528
But we gotta keep things
going here, folks.

1233
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:40,030
That's right 'cause it's showtime!

1234
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:43,867
Introducing, uh,

1235
01:01:44,993 --> 01:01:47,704
Quick Rick Roberts

1236
01:01:48,997 --> 01:01:51,708
and Tonga Tom!

1237
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:57,297
Now, this is a very,
very special exhibition match!

1238
01:01:57,339 --> 01:02:01,551
Now that means $1,000,

1239
01:02:01,593 --> 01:02:04,471
that's right, 1,000
good old American dollars

1240
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:07,098
to any <i>2</i> local boys

1241
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,893
who think they can pin
either Tonga Tom

1242
01:02:09,935 --> 01:02:12,479
or Quick Rick Roberts.

1243
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:15,732
So, what do you say? Who do we got here,
huh? Don't be shy.

1244
01:02:15,774 --> 01:02:20,028
Number 1 on the list
is pee wee Hutchins.

1245
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,571
Where are you, pee wee?

1246
01:02:21,613 --> 01:02:23,406
Here I am, Elmo!

1247
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,036
Come on down, pee wee.

1248
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:32,290
Harry, I can't do this.

1249
01:02:32,332 --> 01:02:34,542
You wanna lose $1000? No.

1250
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:38,380
And joining pee wee is his brother

1251
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:41,174
little will Hutchins!

1252
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:49,891
All right! Let's get to it!

1253
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:52,143
Woo-hoo!

1254
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:58,233
All right! Let's get to it!

1255
01:02:58,275 --> 01:03:01,695
All right, little will,
you gonna get 'em!

1256
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:10,120
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

1257
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:12,580
Ain't we supposed to shake first?

1258
01:03:13,707 --> 01:03:14,916
Whoa!

1259
01:03:16,668 --> 01:03:19,879
T #

1260
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:23,925
Come on, Rick, get up! Come on,
baby, get up! Get up, will you?

1261
01:03:23,967 --> 01:03:26,094
Come on, Rick, let's go! Get up!

1262
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:27,429
Harry! What?

1263
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:29,180
Do something!

1264
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:31,766
I'll be right back. I'll go out
to the bus and get the papers.

1265
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:32,851
Papers?

1266
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:34,936
Yeah, we'll sign this guy!

1267
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:36,938
Get serious!

1268
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:38,648
Right, ok, ok, we won't sign him.

1269
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:40,317
Come on, Rick, get up!

1270
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:41,985
Stay right there.

1271
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:48,908
All right, listen.
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Listen!

1272
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:51,119
That organ is killing us!

1273
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:53,872
We need some sounds of our
own. What do you want us to play?

1274
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:56,100
What do I want you... I don't care,
anything, something.

1275
01:03:56,124 --> 01:03:57,584
Just give me some decibels, ok?

1276
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:58,626
<i>OK.</i>

1277
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:07,886

1278

1279
01:04:17,771 --> 01:04:20,106
Turn him around!

1280
01:04:20,148 --> 01:04:22,108
Turn him around and back him up!

1281
01:04:23,234 --> 01:04:24,903
T #

1282
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:29,032
Harry, do something!

1283
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:31,576
Go!

1284
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:36,664
Now, you listen to me.

1285
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:40,710
You don't wanna be
messin' with me.

1286
01:04:40,752 --> 01:04:43,797
I'm tellin' ya,
I will send you home to your mama.

1287
01:04:44,089 --> 01:04:45,215
Ugh!

1288
01:05:13,201 --> 01:05:14,953
You're all right, buddy!

1289
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:21,751
What a show! I've never
seen this town so excited!

1290
01:05:21,793 --> 01:05:23,545
How about a repeat on the 24th?

1291
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:25,296
Well, you know, we're real...

1292
01:05:26,256 --> 01:05:28,133
Available.

1293
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:30,528
It's been a pleasure doin' business
with ya, Elmo, we'll be in touch.

1294
01:05:30,552 --> 01:05:31,594
Great!

1295
01:05:33,221 --> 01:05:35,014
Appreciate it.
See ya later, Elmo.

1296
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:37,142
All right!

1297
01:05:38,518 --> 01:05:40,186
Hey, uh, hold it!

1298
01:05:40,228 --> 01:05:41,855
It can't be the 24th!

1299
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:44,232
That's artificial
insemination night!

1300
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:45,942
How about the 25th?

Hi, I'd like a chivas and soda.

1326
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:13,488
Could you make that 2?

1327
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:16,199
Mr. Smilac? Yes.

1328
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:19,202
I'm herb brown. I'm a writer.
Oh.

1329
01:07:19,244 --> 01:07:21,722
I'm interested in this rock 'n
roll wrestling business of yours.

1330
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:23,289
Well, who isn't?

1331
01:07:23,331 --> 01:07:24,582
Looks like a big success.

1332
01:07:24,624 --> 01:07:26,876
Well, I'd use the word
"enormous."

1333
01:07:26,918 --> 01:07:29,837
If you don't mind, I'd like to take
just a few minutes of your time

1334
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:32,298
and maybe that of your
wrestlers and your band Kicks.

1335
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:34,217
Actually, that's "Kick," no.

1336
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:37,220
What happened to the "s?"

1337
01:07:37,262 --> 01:07:40,306
Well, you know, when you're in the
big time, you need a big-time name.

1338
01:07:40,348 --> 01:07:43,059
I mean, whoever heard
of the Kisses, or the Whos?

1339
01:07:43,101 --> 01:07:44,561
How about the Beatles?

1340
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:47,272
Yeah, right. Look,
I'm real busy now, so...

1341
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:49,148
This won't take long.

1342
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:50,900
Uh, what we'd like to do
is run a piece

1343
01:07:50,942 --> 01:07:52,569
in next week's issue
of Rolling Stone.

1344
01:07:53,653 --> 01:07:55,071
Oh.

1345
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:57,240
Rolling Stone. Yeah.

1346
01:07:57,282 --> 01:08:00,368
Yeah, well, you see, it,
uh, it, uh, really all began

1347
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:03,955
when I realized a crying
need in this country, herb,

1348
01:08:03,997 --> 01:08:07,208
for, uh, you know, good,
old-fashioned family entertainment.

1349
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:10,461
I just reached right out there
and took the public's pulse.

1350
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:16,593
Uh-huh, ok. Now sign it,

1351
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:19,470
"your favorite
personal manager, Harry."

1352
01:08:20,471 --> 01:08:22,140
No, no, no, wait,

1353
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:24,809
make that "love",

1354
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:28,146
your favorite personal..."
Etcetera, etcetera.

1355
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:31,274
Why don't you just call Candace
instead of sending her postcards?

1356
01:08:31,316 --> 01:08:32,525
I tried, missy,

1357
01:08:32,567 --> 01:08:34,777
but I keep getting the
housekeeper or her mother,

1358
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:37,238
and they just hang up.
Will you just mail the, uh...

1359
01:08:39,073 --> 01:08:40,408
Good.

1360
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:42,910
Hey!

1361
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:45,288
Would you look at this?

1362
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:47,707
Would you look at this?

1363
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:48,958
Yeah?

1364
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,836
Harry, I knew you could do it!

1365
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:55,840
You have brought us
to the top, man!

1366
01:08:56,341 --> 01:08:57,717
Well,

1367
01:08:57,759 --> 01:08:58,885
almost.

1368
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:01,846
Almost? Would you...

1369
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:04,474
Page 72, look at this right
here. There it is. Look, it says,

1370
01:09:05,433 --> 01:09:07,101
"they have created

1371
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:10,563
"the entertainment
event of the year.

1372
01:09:10,605 --> 01:09:13,024
"Have changed
the face of wrestling,

1373
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:15,985
and possibly music."

1374
01:09:16,027 --> 01:09:17,403
What more do you want?

1375
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:21,324
The championship, Rick.

1376
01:09:21,366 --> 01:09:23,993
That's right,
world tag team title.

1377
01:09:24,035 --> 01:09:25,870
Now, the question is,

1378
01:09:25,912 --> 01:09:28,206
can the two of you
take The Cannibals?

1379
01:09:29,248 --> 01:09:33,211
I give you my personal guarantee.

1380
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:35,797
But what good's that gonna do?

1381
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:39,967
Those guys have had the belts
for 5 long years.

1382
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:42,595
The Captain ain't gonna
give us a shot at it.

1383
01:09:42,637 --> 01:09:45,014
Especially if he knows
we're prepared.

1384
01:09:46,057 --> 01:09:47,725
Aw, hey, guys...

1385
01:09:48,643 --> 01:09:50,061
"Trust me."

1386
01:09:51,396 --> 01:09:54,607
And now, here's Vic!

1387
01:09:54,649 --> 01:09:56,526
Hello, wrestling fans.

1388
01:09:56,567 --> 01:09:57,568
Good evening.

1389
01:09:59,696 --> 01:10:00,905
Pull up your stools

1390
01:10:00,947 --> 01:10:03,032
because we have a great show
for you tonight.

1391
01:10:03,074 --> 01:10:05,243
I'm sure you all remember
a couple of months ago

1392
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:07,388
when Captain Lou, here,
and Harry Smilac were on the show

1393
01:10:07,412 --> 01:10:10,206
and they had
a slight disagreement.

1394
01:10:10,248 --> 01:10:12,166
Well, they are back again tonight,

1395
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,085
so who knows what's gonna happen?

1396
01:10:14,127 --> 01:10:15,294
In the last couple of months,

1397
01:10:15,336 --> 01:10:17,338
this is wonderful,
you have truly changed

1398
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:19,799
the entire face of wrestling.

1399
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:21,259
That's right.

1400
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:24,512
Well, the real credit lies with
wrestling fans everywhere.

1401
01:10:25,346 --> 01:10:26,889
Yeah, all I did was, uh,

1402
01:10:26,931 --> 01:10:29,225
give 'em a chance
to see a great sport

1403
01:10:29,267 --> 01:10:33,271
in a way that's refreshing, inspirational,
provocative, entertaining...

1404
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:35,106
No, no, no! You know,
you took a chance,

1405
01:10:35,148 --> 01:10:37,650
combining rock and wrestling.

1406
01:10:37,692 --> 01:10:39,861
I-I-It's wrestling for wimps!

1407
01:10:41,112 --> 01:10:42,905
You don't need music to wrestle,

1408
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:44,532
you need balls!

1409
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:45,950
Big ones!

1410
01:10:45,992 --> 01:10:47,201
Thank you, Tim.

1411
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:49,495
Captain, do you have
any thoughts on this?

1412
01:10:49,537 --> 01:10:52,665
Uh, these rock 'n wrestling concerts,
they're like junk foods.

1413
01:10:52,707 --> 01:10:55,251
They're all wrapped up
in a pretty little package,

1414
01:10:55,293 --> 01:10:57,503
but too much of it makes you sick.

1415
01:10:57,545 --> 01:11:00,006
Just like this guy, Smilac,
makes me sick!

1416
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:02,300
Well, Harry, it looks like
your colleagues, here, Harry,

1417
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:05,553
are not exactly your biggest fans.

1418
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:08,306
But gentlemen,
you cannot argue with the numbers.

1419
01:11:08,347 --> 01:11:11,225
That's right. And Smilac's
shows are drawing.

1420
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:12,494
Harry, do you have any thoughts

1421
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:13,895
about bringing it to the big city?

1422
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:15,146
Well, I'm glad you asked...

1423
01:11:15,188 --> 01:11:17,857
Hey, man, nobody would
come out and see it.

1424
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:19,942
Oh, hey, wait, I take that back.

1425
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:23,529
Maybe, uh, some of Smilac's
old boyfriends would.

1426
01:11:23,571 --> 01:11:25,466
You know the type I mean,
the ones with earrings.

1427
01:11:25,490 --> 01:11:26,741
Faggots.

1428
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:28,659
Earrings, huh? Like the one

1429
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:30,828
you're wearing in the old, uh...

1430
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:36,083
You know everyone's fed up
with your act.

1431
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:37,710
It's old style,

1432
01:11:37,752 --> 01:11:41,380
boring, passe, baby. Even the
wrestlers are fed up with you.

1433
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:43,466
You're bad-mouthing
the Captain! Why, you...

1434
01:11:43,508 --> 01:11:46,552
You're a dinosaur, your days are
numbered! Settle down. I think that...

1435
01:11:46,594 --> 01:11:48,471
Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah?

1436
01:11:48,513 --> 01:11:50,532
Sounds like we have a slight
disagreement brewing here.

1437
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:52,308
You're a dead man, Smilac!

1438
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:54,560
You and your boys,
I am gonna put you out of wrestling!

1439
01:11:54,602 --> 01:11:57,522
All right, that's fine, I'll tell you what,
I'll give you the chance.

1440
01:11:57,563 --> 01:12:00,733
One match, winner take all.
Have you got the guts for that?

1441
01:12:00,775 --> 01:12:04,070
Whoa! Sounds like we are talking
grudge match here on ring talk!

1442
01:12:04,111 --> 01:12:07,532
Let's get this straight. If my guys win,
you leave the wrestling business.

1443
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:10,201
That's it? Fantastic!
Isn't he smart?

1444
01:12:10,243 --> 01:12:11,536
Any time, pencil-neck!

1445
01:12:11,577 --> 01:12:14,163
Great, ok. How about
2 weeks from Saturday?

1446
01:12:14,205 --> 01:12:17,416
And the tag team belt
goes along with it. Whoa!

1447
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:20,044
I didn't say nothin'
about the championship belt!

1448
01:12:20,086 --> 01:12:22,463
See that? Blimpo finally
showed his true colors. Uh-huh.

1449
01:12:22,505 --> 01:12:24,691
Right here on your show,
Vic. In front of millions of people.

1450
01:12:24,715 --> 01:12:26,467
He can't fool the public.

1451
01:12:26,509 --> 01:12:29,220
Hey, I'm not tryin' to fool
anybody! I never back off a fight!

1452
01:12:29,262 --> 01:12:32,014
Oh. But let's make sure
there's no way to weasel out.

1453
01:12:32,056 --> 01:12:34,433
Especially from a welsher like you,
Smilac! Whoa!

1454
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:36,352
So we put the belts on the line

1455
01:12:36,394 --> 01:12:38,521
and our wrestlers' contracts,
winner take all!

1456
01:12:38,563 --> 01:12:42,400
You've got it! And you heard it here,
folks, on ring talk!

1457
01:12:42,441 --> 01:12:45,361
4 of the greatest wrestlers,
<i>2</i> top managers!

1458
01:12:45,403 --> 01:12:47,613
I don't know about you,
but I can't wait for this one!

1459
01:12:47,655 --> 01:12:50,241
Tim, what do you
think about this, huh? Tim?

1460
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:53,661
Faggofl.

1461
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:56,414
If you don't find that dog,
Debbie,

1462
01:12:56,455 --> 01:12:58,040
start looking for a new job.

1463
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:00,835
Yes, what is it?

1464
01:13:00,877 --> 01:13:04,088
<i>Buenos (has. Candace Vandewagen,
por favor.</i>

1465
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:06,507
Oh, please. Candace,
this is for you.

1466
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:09,510
Ok. Got something for me?

1467
01:13:09,552 --> 01:13:12,597
Uh, yes, an apology.

1468
01:13:12,638 --> 01:13:15,933
The voice sounds familiar,
but I just can't place the face.

1469
01:13:17,143 --> 01:13:19,186
What, you don't
like pussy willows?

1470
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:21,480
Look, I'm takin'
a terrible chance coming here.

1471
01:13:21,522 --> 01:13:24,442
But I wanted to see you.
I've been thinking about us.

1472
01:13:24,483 --> 01:13:27,320
Thinking about us? For 20
cents you could have called me.

1473
01:13:27,361 --> 01:13:29,155
I did call! Honest!

1474
01:13:29,196 --> 01:13:31,407
From every 2-bit town
between here and Phoenix.

1475
01:13:31,449 --> 01:13:33,576
But y-your housekeeper
wouldn't put me through.

1476
01:13:33,618 --> 01:13:37,663
Must have had training from
the Sandinistas. But I did write.

1477
01:13:37,705 --> 01:13:41,542
You call those crummy postcards
written in crayon "writing?"

1478
01:13:41,584 --> 01:13:42,668
You didn't like those?

1479
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:44,128
Candace!

1480
01:13:46,047 --> 01:13:47,673
Quick! Quick!

1481
01:13:47,715 --> 01:13:48,966
Harry! An elevator?

1482
01:13:49,008 --> 01:13:50,676
Drop the flowers!

1483
01:13:50,718 --> 01:13:52,219
I can't reach the...

1484
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:55,139
You know, I'm...

1485
01:13:55,181 --> 01:13:58,392
I'm so happy that you
came out with me here today.

1486
01:13:58,434 --> 01:13:59,602
Why?

1487
01:13:59,644 --> 01:14:00,645
Well...

1488
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:04,690
Mmm...

1489
01:14:06,525 --> 01:14:07,777
I, uh,

1490
01:14:07,818 --> 01:14:10,571
I have a little something
here for you.

1491
01:14:11,989 --> 01:14:13,950
Funny, it doesn't look
like a diamond.

1492
01:14:15,785 --> 01:14:18,162
No, actually, it's, uh,

1493
01:14:18,204 --> 01:14:20,748
it's for your mother and her friend,
Norton Wilshire.

1494
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,249
Really? Yeah.

1495
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:25,294
It's, uh,
it's my end of the purse,

1496
01:14:25,336 --> 01:14:27,171
if Rick and Tonga win.

1497
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:30,216
I mean, there are enough
bucks there to more than make up

1498
01:14:30,257 --> 01:14:33,260
for the little problem we had at
the Norton Wilshire fund raiser.

1499
01:14:34,595 --> 01:14:36,097
What if they don't win?

1500
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:38,140
Well, I'll, uh,
I'll think of something.

1501
01:14:43,354 --> 01:14:44,355
Hmm.

1502
01:14:50,236 --> 01:14:53,322
Ladies and gentlemen, what a night
we have for you here this evening.

1503
01:14:53,364 --> 01:14:56,158
It's like the super bowl,
the world series,

1504
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:59,495
and the academy awards all rolled into one,
right here.

1505
01:14:59,537 --> 01:15:02,790
I mean, it's incredible,
the stars are here, the beautiful people...

1506
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:18,639
Get out of my way!

1507
01:15:25,104 --> 01:15:26,105
Ah...

1508
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:33,320
Mr. Kim!

1509
01:15:34,405 --> 01:15:35,990
Well, well, well, well,

1510
01:15:36,032 --> 01:15:39,827
now, what could possibly
bring you out here tonight?

1511
01:15:41,162 --> 01:15:44,081
What you think, smirac?
Some business.

1512
01:15:48,419 --> 01:15:50,963
How about if I call you Harry?

1513
01:15:51,005 --> 01:15:54,383
Oh, I don't know, I've kind of
gotten used to smirac.

1514
01:15:54,425 --> 01:15:57,636
Ok. No more Mr. Nice guy!

1515
01:15:57,678 --> 01:15:59,930
I know you're making
big bucks tonight.

1516
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:01,557
You pay up, or else.

1517
01:16:02,767 --> 01:16:04,393
At stake this evening,

1518
01:16:04,435 --> 01:16:07,188
the world wrestling tag team
championship

1519
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:10,775
and the survival of 1 of 2
top managers in wrestling.

1520
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:13,694
Speaking of which,
we have Captain Lou Morano.

1521
01:16:13,736 --> 01:16:16,697
Let's got get a word with him
right now. Come on this way.

1522
01:16:16,739 --> 01:16:18,407
Captain Lou, can I get your...

1523
01:16:18,449 --> 01:16:20,701
Outta my way,
kid! Outta my way! Just one. Please?

1524
01:16:20,743 --> 01:16:22,203
Hey, sign this, Lou!

1525
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:24,455
Captain Lou, any predictions
about tonight's big match?

1526
01:16:24,497 --> 01:16:26,040
Smilac's dead!

1527
01:16:26,082 --> 01:16:28,709
Uh, have you ever seen a tremendous
crowd as we have this evening?

1528
01:16:28,751 --> 01:16:30,795
Smilac's a dead man!

1529
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:33,315
Any special instructions for
your wrestlers this evening, uh...

1530
01:16:33,339 --> 01:16:35,966
Smilac's dead!

1531
01:16:36,008 --> 01:16:39,804
Well, that was, uh, certainly a
meaningful conversation, wasn't it?

1532
01:16:39,845 --> 01:16:42,098
We had... I don't believe this,
what a surprise.

1533
01:16:42,139 --> 01:16:44,934
We have one of California's
gubernatorial candidates here.

1534
01:16:44,975 --> 01:16:47,019
Good to see you.

1535
01:16:47,061 --> 01:16:49,105
Senator Norton Wilshire.
How are you?

1536
01:16:49,146 --> 01:16:50,773
What do you think
about this evening?

1537
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:52,858
Well, it's not really...

1538
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:55,444
No, as a matter of fact,

1539
01:16:55,486 --> 01:16:57,363
these are my kind of people.

1540
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:00,950
The grassroots of America.

1541
01:17:00,991 --> 01:17:04,036
I'm proud to be here
on this special occasion.

1542
01:17:04,954 --> 01:17:06,539
Listen, Kim,

1543
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:09,180
you know, you... you're becoming
a real pain in the ass, you know,

1544
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:11,293
so, here's the way it's gonna be.

1545
01:17:11,335 --> 01:17:13,546
You're gonna get off my back

1546
01:17:13,587 --> 01:17:15,798
and stay away from my cars.

1547
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:20,386
Now, this beauty here
cost me $85,000.

1548
01:17:20,427 --> 01:17:23,597
Now, one little nick on that baby,

1549
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:27,393
and you'll be back in Japan
before you can say "egg foo Yung."

1550
01:17:27,434 --> 01:17:29,770
Egg foo Yung
is Chinese, Mr. Smirac!

1551
01:17:31,438 --> 01:17:32,773
Korean different!

1552
01:17:33,858 --> 01:17:35,109
Excuse me.

1553
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:52,209
3,2,1...

1554
01:17:52,251 --> 01:17:55,754
Well, wrestling fans,
now we get down to that moment of truth.

1555
01:17:55,796 --> 01:17:57,673
4 men in the square circle,

1556
01:17:57,715 --> 01:17:59,466
fighting for
their professional lives

1557
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:01,719
and the right to wear
a championship belt.

1558
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,180
And just look at that great
crowd down there tonight.

1559
01:18:04,221 --> 01:18:07,224
Virtually a who's who
in wrestling history.

1560
01:18:07,266 --> 01:18:08,934
Ladies and gentlemen,

1561
01:18:08,976 --> 01:18:11,854
the N.W.A. World champion,
Ric Flair.

1562
01:18:18,027 --> 01:18:20,738
Next, the one and only
"Classy" Freddie Blassie.

1563
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:22,531
Always a gentleman.

1564
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:29,955
I can see true legends
at ringside.

1565
01:18:29,997 --> 01:18:34,001
Don't tell me. You're reason
for birth control.

1566
01:18:34,043 --> 01:18:37,379
And there's wrestling's evil genius,
Sheik Adnan El Kassey.

1567
01:18:43,302 --> 01:18:45,387
Professional wrestling's
living legend,

1568
01:18:45,429 --> 01:18:49,099
15-year world champion
Bruno San Martino.

1569
01:18:52,686 --> 01:18:56,023
Oh, and by the way, I myself
will be doing the blow-by-blow and,

1570
01:18:56,065 --> 01:18:59,902
oh, and here joining me for some
color commentary is a man you all love.

1571
01:18:59,944 --> 01:19:01,824
You've seen him many times
on my show ring talk.

1572
01:19:01,862 --> 01:19:03,322
Let's welcome Tim Mcclusky.

1573
01:19:03,364 --> 01:19:04,990
Oh, thank you very much, uh, Vic.

1574
01:19:05,032 --> 01:19:06,367
And ladies and gentlemen...

1575
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:09,119
Tim, you know these 4 men,
you've watched these 4 men,

1576
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:10,955
how do you see this match, Tim?

1577
01:19:10,996 --> 01:19:13,332
Well, all 4 wrestlers are great athletes,
uh-huh.

1578
01:19:13,374 --> 01:19:14,875
And the difference
in this match is...

1579
01:19:14,917 --> 01:19:17,544
That's very interesting, Tim,
but let's go to ringside now

1580
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:20,186
and catch them with that great
music by that wonderful group Kick.

1581
01:19:21,674 --> 01:19:23,860
Hey, bozo, you cut me off
one more time and I'll deck you!

1582
01:19:23,884 --> 01:19:25,386
T #

1583
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:28,138
# Another hard-working kid #

1584
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:30,015
# listen, show us what you got #

1585
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:34,270
# and it's just what I do #

1586
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:37,398
# ain't saying that
it'd be easy #

1587
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:40,734
# no one said that
it'd be free #

1588
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:43,696
# I earn my living
in the U.S.A. #

1589
01:19:43,737 --> 01:19:46,198
# There's no place
that I'd rather be #

1590
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:48,075
# can't you feel it
in your bones? #

1591
01:19:49,743 --> 01:19:52,121
# Runnin' through your veins #

1592
01:19:52,162 --> 01:19:54,039
# it's the American way #

1593
01:19:55,165 --> 01:19:57,167
# and it's never gonna change #

1594
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:02,923
# you get up early
and go home proud #

1595
01:20:02,965 --> 01:20:05,467
# lemme at 'em, lemme at 'em #

1596
01:20:05,509 --> 01:20:08,721
# land of the free,
shout it out loud #

1597
01:20:09,722 --> 01:20:12,308
# it's the American way #

1598
01:20:12,349 --> 01:20:15,728
# yeah, yeah #

1599
01:20:15,769 --> 01:20:18,439
# it's the American way #

1600
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,065
# yeah, yeah #

1601
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:24,153
# it's the American way #

1602
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:26,947
# yeah, yeah #

1603
01:20:28,449 --> 01:20:29,783
# all right #

1604
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:36,665
# runnin' at the work site #

1605
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:39,376
# I've got a job to do #

1606
01:20:41,128 --> 01:20:42,546
# flex a little muscle #

1607
01:20:43,589 --> 01:20:45,424
# until the job is through #

1608
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,469
# but you know within our work #

1609
01:20:49,553 --> 01:20:51,513
# now I truly have to say #

1610
01:20:51,555 --> 01:20:52,848
Well, guys, uh,

1611
01:20:54,308 --> 01:20:56,143
this is it.

1612
01:20:56,185 --> 01:20:58,771
Harry, we know what we gotta do.

1613
01:20:59,897 --> 01:21:01,057
There's no 2nd chance for us.

1614
01:21:02,024 --> 01:21:04,526
You lose our contracts
to the Captain,

1615
01:21:04,568 --> 01:21:06,487
we're out of wrestling.

1616
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:08,822
We're gonna do it, too, Harry.

1617
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:11,742
# Lemme at 'em, lemme at 'em #

1618
01:21:11,784 --> 01:21:16,038
# land of the free,
shout it out loud #

1619
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:18,791
# it's the American way #

1620
01:21:18,832 --> 01:21:21,877
# yeah, yeah #

1621
01:21:21,919 --> 01:21:24,463
# it's the American way #

1622
01:21:24,505 --> 01:21:27,091
# yeah, yeah #

1623
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:29,843
# it's the American way <i>H'</i>

1624
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:31,595
Get these freaks outta here!

1625
01:21:31,637 --> 01:21:33,514
This is supposed to be
a wrestling match!

1626
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:35,099
I like it that way, fat man.

1627
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:37,684
I don't give a rat's ass
about this program.

1628
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:00,833
Your guitars need tuning.

1629
01:22:06,255 --> 01:22:07,631
Oh, my god.

1630
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:21,061
This is ridiculous!

1631
01:22:21,103 --> 01:22:23,313
This is the worst thing
I've ever seen in my life!

1632
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:24,995
What? It's great.
Look at those cannibals.

1633
01:22:25,023 --> 01:22:26,251
Why don't they let the kids play?

1634
01:22:26,275 --> 01:22:27,943
Well, they're wrestlers.
They're not...

1635
01:22:29,153 --> 01:22:31,029
Get out of the ring, Lou!

1636
01:22:40,414 --> 01:22:42,082
They're better than the kids!

1637
01:22:42,124 --> 01:22:43,625
Will you shut up, for god's sake?

1638
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:45,752
I'm gonna go down
and talk to the kids myself.

1639
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:47,421
Hey, hey, you! Hey!

1640
01:22:47,463 --> 01:22:48,464
Hey, hey!

1641
01:22:59,725 --> 01:23:02,078
Hey, Smilac, you better get
out there. Your band's in trouble.

1642
01:23:02,102 --> 01:23:03,645
What do you mean my band's in...

1643
01:23:03,687 --> 01:23:05,767
Captain Lou and... and
The Cannibals are... oh, great

1644
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:13,030
ladies and gentlemen, uh,
Vic Carson can't be with us right now.

1645
01:23:13,071 --> 01:23:14,531
He has a slight headache.

1646
01:23:14,573 --> 01:23:18,118
But joining me is one of
the great sports announcers

1647
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:20,162
to help me with the blow-by-blow,

1648
01:23:20,746 --> 01:23:21,997
Chick Hearn!

1649
01:23:22,039 --> 01:23:23,266
Well, thank you very much, Tim.

1650
01:23:23,290 --> 01:23:25,209
Ladies, and gentlemen,
it took me a little while

1651
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:27,377
to get up from ring side.
But here we are.

1652
01:23:27,419 --> 01:23:29,296
The fight
has just gotten underway.

1653
01:23:29,338 --> 01:23:31,858
About 4 and a half months ago
they retained their world championship

1654
01:23:31,882 --> 01:23:34,801
by using every dirty trick in the
wrestling game, including chains.

1655
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:36,863
And tonight they're coming
out without their chains,

1656
01:23:36,887 --> 01:23:39,199
but they're starting to apply
every kind of unfashionable hold

1657
01:23:39,223 --> 01:23:41,183
that the wrestling world
has ever seen.

1658
01:23:53,195 --> 01:23:56,031
And so far,
despite that punch by Tonga,

1659
01:23:56,073 --> 01:23:58,116
it has been
pretty much The Cannibals.

1660
01:24:01,995 --> 01:24:04,289
There's an arm sling,
and out of the ring goes Rick!

1661
01:24:04,331 --> 01:24:06,917
Rick is on the cement,
outside of the ring!

1662
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:11,255
Ahhh!

1663
01:24:14,508 --> 01:24:15,509
Ugh.

1664
01:24:17,261 --> 01:24:18,345
Harry!

1665
01:24:25,561 --> 01:24:26,603
Harry!

1666
01:24:40,284 --> 01:24:43,245
A close line. Ooh,
a vicious close line to Tonga.

1667
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:46,957
Look out for this one.

1668
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:50,711
And down goes Tonga!

1669
01:24:50,752 --> 01:24:52,921
Tonga may not be able to
get up for a while.

1670
01:24:52,963 --> 01:24:55,340
They go outside of the ring
and they floor Rick!

1671
01:24:55,382 --> 01:24:57,342
There's all kinds of trouble here.

1672
01:24:57,384 --> 01:25:00,224
The world champion tag team looks
like they're gonna successfully defend

1673
01:25:00,262 --> 01:25:01,680
without too much of an effort.

1674
01:25:01,722 --> 01:25:03,849
But here comes Rick into the ring.

1675
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:07,185
But look at this,
an overhead body slam!

1676
01:25:07,227 --> 01:25:09,521
Ooh, that hurts
all the way up here!

1677
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:20,198
That's a body slam by Tonga.

1678
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:22,117
Beautiful move by Tonga.

1679
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:24,870
Is he gonna get the count? Nope,
he hasn't got a one-count.

1680
01:25:24,911 --> 01:25:27,247
But that shows them that they
might be back in this fight.

1681
01:25:27,289 --> 01:25:29,249
The world championship
is on the line.

1682
01:25:29,291 --> 01:25:34,254
Oh, The Hammer delivers a vicious
2-handed blow to the head of Tonga.

1683
01:25:48,435 --> 01:25:51,188
Off of the top strand of the rope,
he's gonna try a body press!

1684
01:25:51,229 --> 01:25:53,398
But he missed it,
Tonga moved just in time.

1685
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:55,192
He's gotta give the hand to Rick.

1686
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:57,545
He's gotta touch Rick because
Rick's got to get in the fight.

1687
01:25:57,569 --> 01:25:59,279
And he does get to him!

1688
01:26:25,472 --> 01:26:28,975
Is this some kind of a match?
We hope you're enjoying it.

1689
01:26:29,017 --> 01:26:31,853
Oh, there's Tonga,
and he pulls a 2-man pass with it.

1690
01:26:31,895 --> 01:26:34,231
And Tonga right now
is a little bit angry himself.

1691
01:26:34,272 --> 01:26:37,109
They're gonna try
a double bulldog!

1692
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:39,945
I don't believe it.
A double bulldog!

1693
01:26:39,986 --> 01:26:43,281
Ooh, that'll put
your wallet in place.

1694
01:26:43,323 --> 01:26:45,117
How about that?

1695
01:26:45,158 --> 01:26:47,744
Now, both men are on the floor,
so are The Cannibals.

1696
01:26:47,786 --> 01:26:49,413
Why don't they finish 'em?

1697
01:26:49,454 --> 01:26:51,391
Because the want to meat out
the same kind of punishment

1698
01:26:51,415 --> 01:26:54,459
that put them in the hospital
4 and a half months ago.

1699
01:27:03,468 --> 01:27:07,389
Whoo! Tonga flew through
the air like a b-747.

1700
01:27:07,431 --> 01:27:09,975
A chance for the pin. 2, 3!

1701
01:27:20,694 --> 01:27:22,988
We did it! We did it!

1702
01:27:29,745 --> 01:27:31,997
You guys were beautiful!

T #

1704
01:27:53,935 --> 01:27:57,939
# I shouldn't be here
touching you #

1705
01:27:57,981 --> 01:28:02,360
# and I shouldn't
love the way you feel #

1706
01:28:02,402 --> 01:28:06,406
# I know you've got somebody
waiting at home #

1707
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:14,706
# I tried so hard
to tell you no #

1708
01:28:14,748 --> 01:28:19,002
# but when you touch me
like you do #

1709
01:28:19,044 --> 01:28:23,757
# my best intentions
keep falling apart #

1710
01:28:23,799 --> 01:28:25,509
<i># oh, lord #</i>

1711
01:28:27,177 --> 01:28:31,348
# and just when I find
the strength to leave #

1712
01:28:31,389 --> 01:28:35,560
# you put your magic spell
on me #

1713
01:28:35,602 --> 01:28:38,104
# and baby, I can't hold on #

1714
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:41,358
# my body keeps
changing my mind #

1715

1716
01:28:45,070 --> 01:28:47,322

1721
01:29:02,963 --> 01:29:07,133
# watching you run
to him again #

1722
01:29:07,175 --> 01:29:11,429
# sometimes I think
it's just not worth the pain #

1723
01:29:15,475 --> 01:29:19,563
<i># then you go back
you're teasing me I</i>

1724
01:29:19,604 --> 01:29:23,733

nobody can #

1725

# you get me falling
all over again #

1726
01:29:31,616 --> 01:29:36,454

I can walk away #
