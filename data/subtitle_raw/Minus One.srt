1
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:56,777
* Decide to hold my dreams

2
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,617
- Good morning, sunshine.

3
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:04,885
- Good morning.

4
00:03:20,768 --> 00:03:22,470
- Hey, David, how's it going?

5
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,037
- Craptacular.

6
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,906
Paper and a
large dark roast to go?

7
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:27,074
Yep.

8
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:30,043
Nothing
to eat this morning?

9
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,379
Nah, just the coffee.

10
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,146
- Ah, you're killing
me, never a bagel

11
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,483
or dare you try a latte?

12
00:03:35,483 --> 00:03:38,319
- I like my coffee one way,

13
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,988
dark and bitter just like Mamet.

14
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,224
See you tomorrow.

15
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,230
- Dude, wake up.

16
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:51,999
Robert.

17
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:52,933
- What?

18
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,101
Get up, man!

19
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:54,935
- What time is it?

20
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:56,270
8:25.

21
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,738
What day is it?

22
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,773
It's Friday.

23
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:00,641
Jesus dude.

24
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:07,348
Shit.

25
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,451
- Ah, glad you could
join us, Mr. Montgomery.

26
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:46,520
I have a place
reserved just for you.

27
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:53,394
- Rough night?

28
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:57,465
- You should know.

29
00:04:57,465 --> 00:05:01,335
You have
one hour, starting now.

30
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,560
- Hey John, what's up?

31
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,662
First Sergeant Solomon,
this is Captain Brighton,

32
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:29,997
prepare to copy.

33
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:35,969
- Ready to copy, sir.

34
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:37,471
Our unit
has been activated.

35
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:40,908
You will report to the Army
at 0700 on Friday, 12, August.

36
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:43,310
Bring all of your gear, we'll
have a shake-down inspection.

37
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,879
You will receive more information at morning formation.

38
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,215
The uniform of the
day will be ACU's.

39
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:50,250
It is your responsibility
to notify anyone else

40
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,186
under you of the information
I have just disseminated.

41
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,322
Do you have any questions?

42
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:57,391
- Do we know where we're going?

43
00:05:57,391 --> 00:06:00,093
No, you
know as much as I do.

44
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,095
- Roger that, sir.

45
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,532
Do you have any
other questions, David?

46
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:05,799
- No, sir.

47
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:06,867
Out.

48
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,294
James Whitmore.

49
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:35,729
- Sergeant Whitmore, this
is First Sergeant Solomon,

50
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,698
prepare to copy.

51
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:39,500
So dude,
did Jenny stay all night?

52
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,268
Nah, she must
have left after I passed out.

53
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:43,671
Dude, you're
such a lightweight.

54
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,006
- Yeah?

55
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:46,740
PFC Montgomery?

56
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,208
- Yeah.

57
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,143
PFC Montgomery, this
is First Sergeant Solomon,

58
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:51,078
prepare to copy.

59
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:52,513
- Ready to copy.

60
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:54,414
Our unit's
been activated.

61
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:58,251
You'll report to the Armory
at 0700, Friday, 12, August.

62
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,453
You need to bring
all of your gear.

63
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:01,555
There's gonna be a
shake-down inspection.

64
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:04,725
Uniform of the day
is gonna be ACU's.

65
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:06,894
Do you have any questions?

66
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:10,631
What if, um, you
know, what if I'm over there--

67
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:15,636
James, we can't even
start to think like that.

68
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,107
Look at me.

69
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:26,547
I can't have you
thinking that way.

70
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:31,719
- The last time,

71
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:34,555
it was different, you know,

72
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:38,158
it was just policing and
that's all we ever did.

73
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:39,960
The only time I saw action

74
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,130
was when someone got
too drunk on base

75
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:46,634
and there was one night

76
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:51,572
where some asshole was
playing with a grenade and

77
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:55,308
I didn't see it, I
mean, I heard it.

78
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,578
I didn't even see it and it

79
00:08:01,549 --> 00:08:02,382
this time,

80
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:06,954
this time is,

81
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:29,943
- Hello?

82
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:31,311
Hey mom.

83
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:33,080
Who is it?

84
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,048
- It's Robert.

85
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:36,216
He's not
getting anymore money

86
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:37,951
until the first of the month.

87
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:40,387
Tell him he can eat that Army
food if he needs to get by.

88
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:42,055
- Ray.

89
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:43,390
Sorry sweetheart.

90
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,559
So, what's going on, my son?

91
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,560
How are classes?

92
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,762
- Uh, they're fine.

93
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:50,030
It would have been nice

94
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,464
if you could have
been home for more

95
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,300
than just a couple of weeks.

96
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,435
I'm sorry you had to take
those summer courses.

97
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:56,670
- Yeah, me too.

98
00:08:57,805 --> 00:08:58,839
- Did you need
anything, sweetie?

99
00:08:58,839 --> 00:08:59,840
Food, money?

100
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:03,543
You know your father's
just being

101
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,579
well, your father.

102
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:07,114
- No, no, I'm fine.

103
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:11,018
I actually wasn't calling
about anything like that.

104
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:13,220
Well what is it, Robert?

105
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,955
- I got a call today.

106
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:16,056
From?

107
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:19,426
- I got the call today.

108
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:21,494
My units being activated.

109
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:25,365
We're being deployed.

110
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:29,703
Mom?

111
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:34,007
Mom.

112
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:41,348
- Baby no, no, no, not
my baby, not my baby.

113
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,785
- Linda, what's going on?

114
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:46,687
- Okay, this can't be
happening, you're in school.

115
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:50,691
They can't, they can't take you
outta school in the middle--

116
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:51,825
They can.

117
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:52,793
- They can't.

118
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:54,127
- Mom, they can.

119
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:56,563
And they did.

120
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:59,166
What's going on, Linda?

121
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:04,672
- They're sending
our baby off to war.

122
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:09,743
They haven't told
us where we're going yet.

123
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:11,945
- They haven't told him where
they're sending him yet.

124
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,747
Military intelligence.

125
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:15,248
- Ray.

126
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:18,551
Mom, I'll let
you know when I do, okay?

127
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,721
What about school?

128
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:23,423
- I have to go talk
to my advisor tomorrow

129
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:26,259
and I'm pretty sure I can
pick up where I leave off.

130
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:30,664
You know, they've probably
done this before, right?

131
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:34,835
My God, my boy,
my boy.

132
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:36,603
Mom, stop
with the my boys, okay?

133
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:38,138
Well you
can have a child

134
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,406
and you go through
this and then you can

135
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:42,209
tell me to stop my
boys, all right?

136
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:44,311
- Okay, sorry.

137
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:50,450
Well mom, I have
some stuff to do.

138
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,720
I have to get some
stuff together,

139
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,622
but um, there's gonna
be a thing on the 12th

140
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:58,325
for friends and family and--

141
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,327
- That's two weeks.

142
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:01,762
I know.

143
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,732
- They're leaving the 12th.

144
00:11:04,732 --> 00:11:08,068
There's gonna be a
small ceremony there.

145
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:13,073
Do you think
you guys can make it?

146
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:16,744
Okay, oh my God.

147
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,412
- Okay mom,

148
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:24,818
I gotta go, but I'll call you
in a couple days, all right?

149
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:28,055
Oh, my boy.

150
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:29,289
My God.

151
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:32,192
Mom,
it's gonna be okay.

152
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:35,929
I love you.

153
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:38,098
- I love you too, sweetie.

154
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:44,671
I gotta go, but
I'll call you in a couple days.

155
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:45,572
- Bye.

156
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:27,180
Hi, this
is Jeanie and Rachel.

157
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,017
We can't get to the phone,
please leave a message.

158
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:40,727
- Fuck it.

159
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:47,534
- Yeah, you were so
quiet that night.

160
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:51,839
I remember telling myself
that if I kept talking,

161
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,674
you wouldn't have a chance
to say it's getting late.

162
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:57,377
Oh, no.

163
00:12:57,377 --> 00:13:00,747
I was so afraid I'd
say something stupid.

164
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:02,149
- We just sat there.

165
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:03,083
We didn't make it to the movie.

166
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,418
We didn't make it to dinner,

167
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:08,655
we just sat at that
bar, that bar.

168
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:09,823
What was the name of that bar?

169
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:10,657
- Oh.

170
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:13,426
Thurman's.

171
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:16,329
- Yeah, yeah,
Thurman's that's right.

172
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:17,831
We just sat there.

173
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,434
I didn't mind

174
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:24,337
that we never made
it to Davinci's.

175
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:27,340
- Neither did I.

176
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:36,850
- And then we just sat out
front after they closed.

177
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:42,923
- Yeah, I was an
exciting guy, wasn't I?

178
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:45,758
- It was perfect.

179
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,799
- It turned out well, didn't it?

180
00:13:57,704 --> 00:13:59,672
- It turned out perfect.

181
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:02,375
- La la la la la la la la--

182
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,276
- I got a feeling
about this one.

183
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:04,277
Yeah?

184
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:06,146
Oh, how about that?

185
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:08,548
Drink up boys.

186
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:09,816
- Cheers.
- Meh.

187
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:16,890
- You know what,
fuck that, all right?

188
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,927
Cheers to my man, Bobby,
kicking ass and taking names

189
00:14:19,927 --> 00:14:21,061
in the fuckin' sandpit.

190
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:22,262
- Yeah, take care of Bin Ladin

191
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:25,365
and make mommy and daddy proud.

192
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:00,633
- Hi.

193
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:03,403
- Hi.

194
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:08,775
- Is Rachel home?

195
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:10,710
- David, you can't
just stop by like this.

196
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,544
We agreed.

197
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:13,513
I know.

198
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:15,182
- No, we both agreed.

199
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:16,516
- Jesus, I know.

200
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:22,522
- She's at her piano
lesson, it's Tuesday.

201
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:24,257
- When's her recital?

202
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:28,795
- It's three weeks from today.

203
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:30,363
- Fine, I'll just--

204
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:33,466
- You'll just what?

205
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:38,805
- When did the swing do that?

206
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:41,174
- I don't know.

207
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:42,775
I don't know, David.

208
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,778
There's a lot of shit around
here that needs to be fixed.

209
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:46,980
Would you like me
to make you a list

210
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,916
that you only do
half the things on?

211
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,389
Look, I have a lot of
things I have to do

212
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:58,158
before I pick her up.

213
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:00,860
- I got the call.

214
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,736
Our unit's being deployed.

215
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:11,904
- Oh my God.

216
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:17,710
- Yeah.

217
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,545
I uh,

218
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:22,349
I just finished calling my guys.

219
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:24,917
- Is uh, is John still your CO?

220
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:26,719
- Yeah.

221
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:29,156
I was just heading over
to meet him at the Armory

222
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:30,523
to get everything together.

223
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:32,225
- What about Jennifer
and the baby--

224
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:34,861
- No, no, Mosley
switched out of the unit

225
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:37,230
a couple months ago.

226
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,365
- That's good.

227
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:39,632
Yeah.

228
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:42,635
- David, I'm sorry.

229
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,673
Is there anything that I can do?

230
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:51,478
- No, no.

231
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:55,548
Just tell Rachel I was here.

232
00:16:57,984 --> 00:17:01,488
- Do you want to go
with me to pick her up?

233
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:05,625
- I can't, I gotta meet John.

234
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:07,527
But, thanks.

235
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:13,233
- God.

236
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:15,435
Yeah.

237
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:17,504
- Where are you gonna be?

238
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:20,673
Can't say.

239
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:21,508
- Right.

240
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:27,013
- You need to go.

241
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:29,549
Yeah,
yeah, so do you.

242
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,383
- Yeah.

243
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:05,985
- Hey Dean.

244
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:07,754
- Hey David.

245
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,322
- Buy you a drink?

246
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:11,658
- Sure, I'll have another beer.

247
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:13,393
- I was thinking something
a little stronger.

248
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:15,728
I'm in kind of a mood.

249
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:16,963
- Mm, sorry no.

250
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:21,401
Liquor makes me
mean and irrational.

251
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:26,806
- Beer it is then.

252
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:29,776
Get
anything for you, Dave?

253
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:32,245
- Yeah, take a beer and
another one for Dean here.

254
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:33,246
- Thank you.

255
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:41,221
- So, shipping out in
a couple days, huh.

256
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:42,054
- Yeah.

257
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:47,026
- You know everyone here's gonna
be thinking about you guys.

258
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:49,329
- And you know how much it
hurts for Dean here to think,

259
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:52,599
so hurry up and get your
ass back home, would ya?

260
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:54,133
- I'll do my best, Frankie.

261
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,803
- Preferably in one piece too.

262
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,271
I don't want you
taking up anymore room.

263
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:00,340
I got customers to serve.

264
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:10,250
Hey,
watch your six man,

265
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,818
boogie's on your tail.

266
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,119
- Got 'em man, chill out.

267
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,587
If it took you that
long to

268
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:16,356
those fuckers in real life,
you'd be dead, asshole.

269
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:17,557
- Yeah, well hopefully for you,

270
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:19,659
we won't be saying
the same, soldier boy.

271
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,194
Go fuck yourself.

272
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:22,429
You know what?

273
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:23,396
After I get done
kicking your ass--

274
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:24,764
Uh huh?

275
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:26,233
- You can show your patriotism
towards this country

276
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:28,768
and its great citizens
and go fetch us some beer.

277
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,403
How about if
Johnny Little Walker over here

278
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:32,272
goes and gets some fuckin' beer?

279
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:33,506
- What are you trying to say?

280
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,475
The all mighty Striker
Six, the God of War,

281
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:37,210
can't even complete
a simple mission

282
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,078
like going to get us some beer?

283
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:42,181
- I went through a grueling
nine weeks of bootcamp

284
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:46,553
and NIT after that, so I was
gonna cut you some slack,

285
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:50,590
but now I think I'm just
gonna have to smoke your ass

286
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,225
and make you run off haji mart

287
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:54,261
and get us some fuckin' beer.

288
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:55,995
- Boom!
- Oh.

289
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:59,699
Oh, guess who's hoofin' it
to the haji mart now, bitch?

290
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,868
Biatch.

291
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,135
- If you guys don't remember,

292
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:04,637
I'm not even old enough
to buy the beer anyway.

293
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,906
- Oh, so take my I.D., man.

294
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:08,575
They never look at it
that closely anyway.

295
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:13,145
Fuck they can barely speak the
language, let alone read it.

296
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:14,080
- You kidding?

297
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,448
- Don't be such a pussy, man.

298
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:16,383
- Honestly.

299
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:18,751
Fuck.
- Oh, and Striker?

300
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:19,686
- What?

301
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:21,488
Watch your six.

302
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:23,823
- I'd like to update
my earlier comment.

303
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:25,725
Both of you go fuck yourselves.

304
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,327
Oh, ow!

305
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:28,295
Fuckin' dick.

306
00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:30,062
Bitch.

307
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,063
Game on?

308
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,499
- I'm in.

309
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,841
Fuck me.

310
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:21,147
- Come here a second.

311
00:21:21,147 --> 00:21:22,214
Hey, hold up.

312
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:26,218
What's your name?

313
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:28,688
- Why, what'd I do?

314
00:21:28,688 --> 00:21:29,489
I'm not
gonna ask you again, kid,

315
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:31,491
tell me your name.

316
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:33,159
- William Rogers.

317
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:35,762
- Mind showing me some I.D.?

318
00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:40,500
Just made things a whole
hell of a lot worse

319
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,834
for yourself, kid.

320
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:43,470
Hands against the wall.

321
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,304
- God, hey, I'm shipping
out in two days, man,

322
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,839
cut me a break.

323
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:47,940
- Got any weapons or sharp
objects I should know about?

324
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,208
- No, did you fucking hear me?

325
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:50,242
I'm going to Iraq
in two fucking days

326
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:51,277
and I can't buy a fucking beer?

327
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:52,345
- Hey, watch the language.

328
00:21:52,345 --> 00:21:54,080
Tell me your name.

329
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,383
- Robert Montgomery,
Private First Class,

330
00:21:56,383 --> 00:21:57,216
United States Army Reserve--

331
00:21:57,216 --> 00:21:58,818
- Cut the patriot crap.

332
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:01,421
You just purchased
alcohol using a false I.D.

333
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:05,191
and attempted to flee from
an officer of the law.

334
00:22:05,191 --> 00:22:06,593
- Fucking kidding me.

335
00:22:06,593 --> 00:22:09,328
- Hey, I said
watch the language.

336
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,030
You have the right
to remain silent.

337
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,466
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

338
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:14,701
in a court of law.

339
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:16,035
You have the right
to an attorney.

340
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:21,040
If you cannot afford an
attorney

341
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:24,977
Never figured
you for a smoking man.

342
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:29,416
- Yeah, I'm not usually,
but given the circumstances.

343
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:32,419
- You should try flossing.

344
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:33,653
- What?

345
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:35,187
- Flossing.

346
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,790
It's cheaper, better
for your teeth.

347
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,693
You're a strange man.

348
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,429
- If I had a nickel.

349
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:44,230
Thanks for
bringing the stuff.

350
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,665
- Not a problem.

351
00:22:45,665 --> 00:22:46,866
- I was hoping my order would
get here before we left,

352
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,635
but I'm guessing they'll
put it back though.

353
00:22:48,635 --> 00:22:50,870
- Yeah, I can only imagine.

354
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,972
- Be nice if they would
just give us the stuff

355
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:54,441
as standard issue.

356
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:57,043
- Oh, I feel compelled
to remind you

357
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:59,045
that you did, in fact, enlist
in the United States Army.

358
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:00,079
- What?

359
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,581
You're kidding me.

360
00:23:01,581 --> 00:23:03,049
I thought I joined an highly
efficient forward thinking

361
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:05,251
group of individuals acting
towards the common goal

362
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:08,120
of global security.

363
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,388
Hi David.

364
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,222
- Hey Allison.

365
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,558
- How's it going?

366
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:13,726
- Well you know, can't complain.

367
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,394
Wouldn't make any
difference anyway.

368
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,228
- Can I get you anything?

369
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,163
Are you hungry?

370
00:23:17,163 --> 00:23:18,565
- No, thanks, I just ate.

371
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:19,499
- All right.

372
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:20,733
Well, beer's in the fridge,

373
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:21,534
help yourself if
you need anything.

374
00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:22,469
- Thank you.

375
00:23:22,469 --> 00:23:23,269
- I'll get the other one.

376
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:24,637
Thanks.

377
00:23:27,206 --> 00:23:28,641
- Someday you're
gonna have to tell me

378
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:32,612
how you managed that one 'cause
buddy, you married way up.

379
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:34,280
Throw that butt out.

380
00:23:45,492 --> 00:23:46,859
So how you feeling?

381
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:48,595
Good, good.

382
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:52,064
- Jackson finally get
his shit squared away?

383
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,934
- Yeah, he actually passed
the PT test last week.

384
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:57,336
Yeah, I nearly had
a coronary when I saw that.

385
00:23:57,336 --> 00:23:59,105
- Yeah, Jackson nearly
had a coronary doing it.

386
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:01,841
I bet.

387
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:07,279
- Man, I really shouldn't
make this stuff.

388
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,414
- So what about Montgomery?

389
00:24:08,414 --> 00:24:10,717
How's he doing with all this?

390
00:24:10,717 --> 00:24:12,885
- I haven't talked to him one
on one since the phone call.

391
00:24:12,885 --> 00:24:14,721
I swear that kid
thinks he's rolling in

392
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:16,455
like Stormin' Norman.

393
00:24:17,524 --> 00:24:20,392
- Yeah, I remember those days.

394
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,929
- Yeah, he's a good kid.

395
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:26,165
He just hasn't had his
eyes opened for him.

396
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:26,999
- Dunlap.

397
00:24:28,535 --> 00:24:29,368
Dunlap!

398
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:31,938
God damn, Dunlap!
- Yeah?

399
00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:33,372
- Did I hear you
right that the kid

400
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:35,608
that you got out there
is from the 951st

401
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:37,109
and he's due to get
shipped out in two days?

402
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:38,978
That's what he says.

403
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:39,812
- Shit.

404
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,181
Bring him in here.

405
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:46,285
- The kids I work with,
it's kinda like that.

406
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:47,920
You know, they're hard to reach.

407
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,456
They act like they
don't wanna be reached,

408
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:52,358
but when it comes down to it,

409
00:24:52,358 --> 00:24:55,494
they just want to
know that they matter.

410
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,897
- So how do you show
'em that they matter?

411
00:24:57,897 --> 00:24:59,131
- I don't know.

412
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:00,366
If I could tell you
that, I wouldn't have

413
00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:02,301
a stack of cases on
my desk.

414
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:04,470
Each one's different.

415
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,706
Some of them are air tight.

416
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,978
It's a matter of trust and
you build a repore with 'em

417
00:25:11,978 --> 00:25:15,081
and when no one else is
there for 'em, you are.

418
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:16,182
Not all of 'em.

419
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:18,117
I wish that I could be,

420
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:22,388
but when you get that one,

421
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:23,790
when you reach that one,

422
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,624
it's,

423
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:27,126
yeah,

424
00:25:28,427 --> 00:25:30,062
yeah.

425
00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:30,897
- Yeah.

426
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,302
Well I should get going.

427
00:25:36,302 --> 00:25:37,503
It's about time you think about

428
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:38,304
reaching out to
your wife, you know?

429
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,238
Right.

430
00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:40,973
I heard that.

431
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:42,875
Thanks.

432
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,110
It was
that kind of thinking

433
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,512
that got me into my
current situation.

434
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:49,015
- On that note, think you
can get yourself squared away

435
00:25:49,015 --> 00:25:50,182
in the next 48 hours?

436
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:51,918
- Yeah, I guess.

437
00:25:51,918 --> 00:25:53,485
- Great, your confidence
is overwhelming.

438
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:54,987
- Yeah, I'll see you in Canada.

439
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:57,990
Take care
of yourself, David.

440
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,191
- I'll do my best.

441
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:00,727
I mean if I can find
the time between

442
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:02,795
taking care of your husband
and the rest of my soldiers.

443
00:26:02,795 --> 00:26:03,996
I know
what you mean.

444
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:05,264
I can't get this one to remember

445
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:08,601
to pick up his ring
from the jeweler's.

446
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:09,602
- Call me if you need anything.

447
00:26:09,602 --> 00:26:10,569
- Yeah, will do.

448
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:11,403
Goodnight.

449
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,105
Goodnight.

450
00:26:31,991 --> 00:26:32,825
Mr. Solomon?

451
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:34,226
- Yeah?

452
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:35,461
This is the
Springfield Police Department,

453
00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:37,496
please hold for
Officer Daugherty.

454
00:26:43,836 --> 00:26:46,138
Hey, what's up?

455
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:48,540
- We have a little situation.

456
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:52,311
I'm telling
you, I didn't do anything.

457
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:53,846
That cop just had it out for me.

458
00:26:53,846 --> 00:26:55,982
God,
just stop talking.

459
00:26:55,982 --> 00:26:59,585
What kind of a moron gives a
fake I.D. to a police officer?

460
00:26:59,585 --> 00:27:01,120
You're lucky they called
David instead of me.

461
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,355
I would have left you here.

462
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:24,176
- Now am I right in
assuming that you're not

463
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:26,245
looking for a big
chicken dinner tonight?

464
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:27,446
No.

465
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:28,948
- No, I'm not right?

466
00:27:28,948 --> 00:27:30,449
- No, I mean, yes.

467
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,786
Wait, what's
a big chicken dinner?

468
00:27:33,786 --> 00:27:35,688
- Bad conduct discharge.

469
00:27:35,688 --> 00:27:37,623
Oh no, no,
no big chicken dinner.

470
00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:39,058
I am stuffed.

471
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:41,894
I'm just looking
for some dessert.

472
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:44,964
- Well, after you.

473
00:27:44,964 --> 00:27:47,233
You are, after all,
our man of the evening.

474
00:27:47,233 --> 00:27:51,037
- Oh, okay, um, well, I can
tell you guys are a little rusty

475
00:27:51,037 --> 00:27:54,106
so I'll show you
how it's done, okay?

476
00:27:59,946 --> 00:28:03,515
* And I made a choice

477
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:07,686
* To use my voice
and tell them-- *

478
00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:11,724
Watch and learn, boys.

479
00:28:13,826 --> 00:28:15,795
- Come on, let me square
things away with Frankie.

480
00:28:15,795 --> 00:28:16,963
- My pleasure.

481
00:28:19,665 --> 00:28:21,734
- You back already?

482
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:22,969
- Frankie.

483
00:28:22,969 --> 00:28:23,903
Yeah, I want you to
meet a friend of mine,

484
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:25,137
this is James Whitmore.

485
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:27,039
- James, good to meet ya.

486
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,474
Nice to
meet you, Frank.

487
00:28:28,474 --> 00:28:32,278
- Please, call me Frankie
like this guy does.

488
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:35,114
Just like he's my
best regular customer.

489
00:28:35,114 --> 00:28:39,451
Not even my mother is allowed
to call me Frankie anymore.

490
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:40,652
How is it you have
the misfortune

491
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:43,022
of knowing our
mutual friend here?

492
00:28:43,022 --> 00:28:44,656
- I'm in the 951st.

493
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:47,359
- Yeah, we're dropping his
rank of Staff Sergeant tonight.

494
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:50,897
What brings
you guys back around here?

495
00:28:50,897 --> 00:28:53,532
- Had a little situation
with the kid over there.

496
00:28:53,532 --> 00:28:55,267
And that would be?

497
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:58,004
PFC Robert Montgomery.

498
00:28:58,004 --> 00:28:59,171
- Oh, do tell.

499
00:29:00,807 --> 00:29:02,608
- Well sparing you the details,

500
00:29:02,608 --> 00:29:04,376
Ben Daugherty let him
go with a warning.

501
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:06,946
He was trying to
purchase with a fake I.D.

502
00:29:06,946 --> 00:29:09,849
He also had a choice
a clash of ideals

503
00:29:09,849 --> 00:29:11,984
with a certain police officer.

504
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:12,952
Dunlap?

505
00:29:12,952 --> 00:29:13,953
- Uh huh.

506
00:29:13,953 --> 00:29:15,154
- Why am I not surprised?

507
00:29:15,154 --> 00:29:18,024
Yeah.

508
00:29:18,024 --> 00:29:20,159
Listen, kid's gonna
find one way or another

509
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:21,627
to get his hands on something.

510
00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:25,297
I'd just rather it be
with a little supervision.

511
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:27,566
- You gonna keep an
eye on him, right?

512
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:30,602
- An eye and a
foot, if necessary.

513
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,139
I appreciate it, Frankie.

514
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:35,707
- It's the least I
can do for you guys.

515
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:36,809
- Montgomery.

516
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,445
Private.

517
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,551
Montgomery, this
is Mr. Townsend.

518
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:47,453
He's gonna be taking
care of us tonight.

519
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:48,687
Say thank you.

520
00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:50,957
Thank
you, Mr. Townsend.

521
00:29:50,957 --> 00:29:53,625
- Tell him how well
behaved we're going to be.

522
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,527
- School boys, sir.

523
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:57,296
- Well just make sure
it's not the boys who

524
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,531
always end up in detention.

525
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:02,434
- Thanks, Frankie.

526
00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:03,269
- Thanks, Frankie.

527
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:04,270
- Thanks, Frank--

528
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:06,238
- That's uh, Mr.
Townsend to you.

529
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:08,841
- Thank you, Mr. Townsend.

530
00:30:08,841 --> 00:30:12,178
- May the road rise to meet you.

531
00:30:12,178 --> 00:30:15,281
May the wind be
always at your back.

532
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:18,784
May the sun shine
warm upon your face

533
00:30:18,784 --> 00:30:22,588
and may the rains fall
softly upon your fields

534
00:30:22,588 --> 00:30:24,991
and until we meet again,

535
00:30:24,991 --> 00:30:28,327
may you always feel
the love of this place.

536
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:35,902
How about a couple
of beers to wash that back?

537
00:30:35,902 --> 00:30:37,036
- Sounds good.

538
00:30:39,939 --> 00:30:43,976
- I've got some unfinished
business to attend to.

539
00:30:45,644 --> 00:30:46,445
Thanks.

540
00:30:48,047 --> 00:30:51,850
- Hey, I almost forgot,
Marilyn's at it again.

541
00:30:57,756 --> 00:30:59,325
On a Wednesday?

542
00:30:59,325 --> 00:31:03,896
- She's starting to rival you
for best regular customer.

543
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:09,601
- Be back in a minute, I
gotta say hello to someone.

544
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:12,138
- Take your time, I'll keep
an eye on Casanova over there.

545
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,645
Hi Marilyn.

546
00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:22,348
- David.

547
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,717
Sit your wise little
ass down, honey,

548
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,819
and have a drink with me.

549
00:31:36,795 --> 00:31:39,698
- So, what are you into tonight?

550
00:31:39,698 --> 00:31:43,535
- Just a little date
with my old friend, Jack.

551
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:48,674
- Been seeing a lot of
him lately, have you?

552
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:53,012
- More than I might like,
but he's always there for me.

553
00:31:53,012 --> 00:31:54,146
- Fuckin' A.

554
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:56,848
- Don't mock me,
you little shit.

555
00:32:06,158 --> 00:32:09,095
- So how you really
doing, Marilyn?

556
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:13,365
- You know how it goes, David.

557
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:18,604
Pretty much a class
A cluster fuck.

558
00:32:22,841 --> 00:32:25,077
But me, soldiering through.

559
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:29,982
- Huh.

560
00:32:31,383 --> 00:32:33,952
Fuckin' right, huh.

561
00:32:37,023 --> 00:32:40,426
- Not spending too many
nights at home, huh?

562
00:32:40,426 --> 00:32:41,593
- Why would I?

563
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:45,998
I don't have a dog
at home to feed.

564
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,402
Do you
want one for a while?

565
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:52,971
Jesus, David.

566
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:56,275
First you can't keep a
wife and a kid around,

567
00:32:56,275 --> 00:32:59,711
is your dog sick of
your shit now too?

568
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:04,516
No, actually
nothing like that.

569
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:09,688
I'm going on a little vacation.

570
00:33:10,856 --> 00:33:13,425
I thought you might
like the company.

571
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:15,261
- Where are you going?

572
00:33:17,163 --> 00:33:19,765
- Somewhere sunny and warm.

573
00:33:19,765 --> 00:33:21,033
- Really?

574
00:33:21,033 --> 00:33:21,867
- Oh yeah.

575
00:33:24,103 --> 00:33:26,872
Best sand storms
you'll ever see.

576
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,083
- Gotta love that free airfare.

577
00:33:38,717 --> 00:33:40,052
- So many perks.

578
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:45,924
- Too many to mention.

579
00:33:52,564 --> 00:33:55,234
You got everything squared away?

580
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,971
- Stopped by the house.

581
00:34:02,408 --> 00:34:05,544
Jeannie was there,
but Rachel wasn't.

582
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:09,415
So what the
hell are you doing here?

583
00:34:09,415 --> 00:34:11,083
- It's a long story.

584
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:13,385
But uh,

585
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:18,357
ended up here with a couple
of guys from the unit.

586
00:34:18,357 --> 00:34:19,625
- That's great.

587
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,061
That's your bonding.

588
00:34:25,164 --> 00:34:29,935
It's not like you're gonna be
spending any time together.

589
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:32,871
How's Jeannie?

590
00:34:38,377 --> 00:34:40,712
- Well you know how it goes.

591
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:46,918
It's more confusing
than the sandpit.

592
00:34:48,354 --> 00:34:52,491
- You looking forward to
things being simple again?

593
00:34:57,463 --> 00:34:59,265
- You need another drink.

594
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:01,533
- You're goddamn right I do.

595
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:04,770
- Well,

596
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:10,342
I'll see you when I see you.

597
00:35:10,342 --> 00:35:12,678
- You know where to find me.

598
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:14,546
David.

599
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:16,948
- Yeah?

600
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:20,852
I'm not the
one you should be asking

601
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:22,354
to watch your dog.

602
00:35:36,435 --> 00:35:38,170
- Send her another
one, would you Frankie?

603
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,771
You sure, Dave?

604
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:42,308
- Yeah, make it a double.

605
00:35:42,308 --> 00:35:43,909
Got it.

606
00:35:45,244 --> 00:35:48,814
Two days,
can you believe it?

607
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:52,251
Two more days and we're
loading up in that C47.

608
00:35:52,251 --> 00:35:53,852
- Yeah, two more days.

609
00:35:53,852 --> 00:35:54,953
You think that'll be
enough time for your balls

610
00:35:54,953 --> 00:35:56,955
to have finally dropped?

611
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,691
- What's that supposed to mean?

612
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:01,260
- You need to get
your head straight.

613
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,929
And we're not leaving on a C47.

614
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:07,566
We're taking a civilian
flight to Germany.

615
00:36:07,566 --> 00:36:08,700
- I know, I'm just saying.

616
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,068
- Yeah, you were just saying.

617
00:36:10,068 --> 00:36:11,537
You were just talking.

618
00:36:11,537 --> 00:36:15,407
That's what you do, you
just talk, you don't think.

619
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:20,546
Army doesn't
pay me to think.

620
00:36:20,546 --> 00:36:21,780
- Is there an original
fuckin' thought

621
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,015
in that head of yours
or is this what you do?

622
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,452
You just quote
lines from movies?

623
00:36:26,452 --> 00:36:27,986
- Forgive me for believing
in what we're doing.

624
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:30,356
- Tell me, what exactly
is it that we do?

625
00:36:30,356 --> 00:36:32,491
- We go, we secure, we
mow down the first fucking

626
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:34,460
camel jockey we see with
a cellphone in his hand--

627
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,761
- Oh that's what we're doing?

628
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:36,762
That's what we're
gonna be doing, huh?

629
00:36:36,762 --> 00:36:39,431
- Keep it simple, stupid.

630
00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:41,533
KISS, you've heard of
that, haven't you, Sarg?

631
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:42,668
- All right, guys.

632
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:43,902
- Haven't you, Sarg?
- All right.

633
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:45,737
All right, just relax,
all right, take it easy.

634
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:47,339
Let's just drink our
beers, all right?

635
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:49,475
After all the trouble I went
through to get it for ya?

636
00:36:49,475 --> 00:36:52,010
These last two days are
gonna go by like two minutes.

637
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,513
So just sit back and enjoy it.

638
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,849
- All right.

639
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:12,230
So where's the
nearest strip club?

640
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,132
Are you serious?

641
00:37:14,132 --> 00:37:16,034
- Thought maybe you could go
for some of that right now.

642
00:37:16,034 --> 00:37:17,969
This place is dead.

643
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:20,439
And uh, I appreciate it and all,

644
00:37:20,439 --> 00:37:23,775
but honestly, only ass
I'm gonna see here tonight

645
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:25,777
is your two guys and uh,

646
00:37:28,314 --> 00:37:31,383
quite frankly, I don't
subscribe to the whole

647
00:37:31,383 --> 00:37:34,453
don't ask, don't
tell side of things.

648
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:36,655
- Yeah well, for the last time,

649
00:37:36,655 --> 00:37:38,490
we're not going to a strip club.

650
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:40,792
- I'm not gonna spend my
last two days here, okay?

651
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:43,161
I can't buy beer
at the haji mart

652
00:37:43,161 --> 00:37:46,264
and I'm with two guys who
have some strange phobia

653
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,599
about making brats.

654
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:48,900
- You can't buy beer where?

655
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,135
- Haji mart.

656
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:51,470
- Mm, do you know
what a haji mart is?

657
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:52,871
- Fuckin' 7-Eleven.

658
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:55,140
- No, you dumb shit.

659
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:58,577
You have no fuckin'
clue what it is, do you?

660
00:37:58,577 --> 00:37:59,578
- Why don't you enlighten me?

661
00:37:59,578 --> 00:38:00,612
- Now why would I wanna do that?

662
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,080
- Because you're my sergeant.

663
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,115
- Well when we get there,
you can find out for yourself

664
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,217
and until we get there,
stop talking about shit

665
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:07,453
you know nothing about.

666
00:38:07,453 --> 00:38:08,954
- What if when we get there--

667
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:10,389
- What if, that has got to
be the most useless question

668
00:38:10,389 --> 00:38:11,723
on the face of this planet.

669
00:38:11,723 --> 00:38:13,659
What if I want you to
shut your fuckin' mouth

670
00:38:13,659 --> 00:38:15,661
and try to learn from
someone else for a change?

671
00:38:15,661 --> 00:38:17,596
- All right, man, take it easy!

672
00:38:17,596 --> 00:38:20,732
Save some of that angry
shit for haji, okay?

673
00:38:20,732 --> 00:38:23,435
How about you save it
for when you come back

674
00:38:23,435 --> 00:38:25,537
and you find out that Jodie's
been giving it to your wife.

675
00:38:25,537 --> 00:38:26,805
What did you just say?

676
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:30,376
- All right, all right,
that's enough, Private.

677
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:32,978
- You have been so hell bent

678
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:36,314
on telling me how it's
gonna be, but you know what?

679
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,149
Let me enlighten
you for a minute.

680
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,150
Do you want
your ass beat inside

681
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,619
or do you want it out?

682
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:41,887
- All right, guys, why
don't we just step outside

683
00:38:41,887 --> 00:38:45,424
and get a breath of
fresh air, all right?

684
00:38:45,424 --> 00:38:46,257
All right?

685
00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:49,861
- After you.

686
00:38:49,861 --> 00:38:51,797
- That's right, after me.

687
00:38:51,797 --> 00:38:53,064
That's where you're gonna be

688
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:54,766
when all the action
takes place, right?

689
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:55,601
Behind me?

690
00:39:06,778 --> 00:39:07,979
You know what your
fuckin' problem--

691
00:39:07,979 --> 00:39:10,048
- Don't you ever
disrespect my wife!

692
00:39:10,048 --> 00:39:11,450
If you ever talk about
her like that again,

693
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:13,519
I will break you,
do you understand?

694
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:14,753
You think you're so fuckin' bad.

695
00:39:14,753 --> 00:39:17,355
You're not a mystery,
you little shit.

696
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,356
I know you.

697
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:19,791
You're mommy's boy.

698
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:21,026
You joined little league

699
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:22,327
so daddy could come to
see how tough you were,

700
00:39:22,327 --> 00:39:23,929
but only he couldn't
make it to the game.

701
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:25,330
- Get him outta my
fuckin' face, man.

702
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,098
- James--
- No, no, no,

703
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:29,568
this is exactly what he needs.

704
00:39:29,568 --> 00:39:32,538
Poor little Robert, never
good enough for daddy.

705
00:39:32,538 --> 00:39:33,739
- All right, come on, guys.

706
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:35,373
- I am fucking sick
and tired of you

707
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:38,143
talking shit about my family.

708
00:39:38,143 --> 00:39:40,646
What the fuck do you do?

709
00:39:40,646 --> 00:39:43,248
Work your fuckin' yuppy job.

710
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:45,250
You got your shiny shoes
and you walk around

711
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:47,285
and spit shit in people's faces

712
00:39:47,285 --> 00:39:50,388
just to see how they'll react.

713
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,592
You know what, you keep a
family together for 20 years

714
00:39:53,592 --> 00:39:55,293
and then you find me
and we'll fucking talk

715
00:39:55,293 --> 00:39:57,162
about little league then, okay?

716
00:39:57,162 --> 00:40:01,066
Because as of now, you
don't know a fucking thing!

717
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:01,900
Okay?

718
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:08,406
- Let's go get in the truck.

719
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,608
- Hey, I don't need your help,

720
00:40:09,608 --> 00:40:11,342
but thanks.
- All right.

721
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:13,512
- Lover's quarrel.

722
00:40:13,512 --> 00:40:15,447
- Just keep on walking.

723
00:40:16,682 --> 00:40:18,917
- What'd you say to me?

724
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,652
- Just keep walking.

725
00:40:20,652 --> 00:40:22,320
- Fuck you, asshole.

726
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,963
Yeah, you'd probably
like that, wouldn't you?

727
00:40:46,678 --> 00:40:50,081
- This is Dunlop, I'm
near that location.

728
00:41:01,493 --> 00:41:02,327
Brighton?

729
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:03,529
- Yes.

730
00:41:03,529 --> 00:41:05,897
Last
door on your right.

731
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:06,898
- Thank you.

732
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:14,806
I'll deal with you in a minute.

733
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,585
Good evening, Sergeant.

734
00:41:26,585 --> 00:41:27,986
- Evening.

735
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:28,954
What is it now?

736
00:41:28,954 --> 00:41:30,155
Major General?

737
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:31,757
Right, I
should be so unlucky.

738
00:41:31,757 --> 00:41:32,924
- It's good to see you, John.

739
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:33,759
How long's it been?

740
00:41:33,759 --> 00:41:35,293
How's Lori?

741
00:41:35,293 --> 00:41:36,828
Oh you know Lori,
keeping me in line, still.

742
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:38,296
- Yeah, well somebody has to.

743
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:39,130
Sit down.

744
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,136
- So, give me an idea
of exactly what it is

745
00:41:45,136 --> 00:41:47,105
I'm walking in to here.

746
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:49,007
- Oh, my fearless
deputy, Barney Fife,

747
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:51,943
he's making his rounds,
keeping the streets safe.

748
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:54,345
He goes past Frank's and
sees a fight going on

749
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,814
in the back entrance.

750
00:41:55,814 --> 00:41:58,249
He steps in to break
it up and somehow,

751
00:41:58,249 --> 00:41:59,317
catches one in the eye.

752
00:41:59,317 --> 00:42:00,118
- Oh shit.

753
00:42:01,887 --> 00:42:03,154
Was it from one of mine?

754
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:05,957
- Funny thing, no one's
really owned up to that.

755
00:42:05,957 --> 00:42:07,759
- And this is the guy that
brought Montgomery in earlier?

756
00:42:07,759 --> 00:42:08,594
Yeah.

757
00:42:08,594 --> 00:42:09,427
It's funny, huh?

758
00:42:09,427 --> 00:42:10,996
- Yeah, it's funny.

759
00:42:10,996 --> 00:42:12,430
Has anyone pressed charges?

760
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:14,900
- Nah, best I can figure,
Solomon and his men

761
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:18,369
are trying to resolve some
differences amongst themselves.

762
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,171
Some civilians heading
out of Frank's,

763
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:21,640
they see it going on and--

764
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,708
And you
know how that goes.

765
00:42:22,708 --> 00:42:25,143
- Yeah, that's how it went.

766
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:26,912
Could have been a lot worse.

767
00:42:26,912 --> 00:42:29,480
But thank God Barney was
there to save the day

768
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,317
and since everyone is saying
someone else hit the officer,

769
00:42:32,317 --> 00:42:34,552
nobody wants to
press any charges,

770
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:37,222
but my guy still got popped, so.

771
00:42:40,659 --> 00:42:42,694
- So, here we are.

772
00:42:42,694 --> 00:42:43,862
- Here we are.

773
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:52,003
You know, John, nobody
wants this to get messy.

774
00:42:53,371 --> 00:42:55,540
I took care of everything.

775
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:57,108
If you ask me,

776
00:42:57,108 --> 00:43:00,078
this is just what
those boys needed.

777
00:43:01,046 --> 00:43:01,913
- Thank you, Ben.

778
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:03,381
- No problem, John.

779
00:43:03,381 --> 00:43:05,016
You just bring those
guys back home safe.

780
00:43:05,016 --> 00:43:06,117
I'll do my best.

781
00:43:06,117 --> 00:43:08,486
I know you will.

782
00:43:08,486 --> 00:43:11,056
Just don't bring 'em
back here tonight.

783
00:43:11,056 --> 00:43:11,957
- Fair enough.

784
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:20,766
- Dunlap!

785
00:43:24,135 --> 00:43:24,970
Dunlap!

786
00:43:32,143 --> 00:43:33,979
- On your feet, let's go.

787
00:43:33,979 --> 00:43:36,915
Montgomery, Whitmore,
wait outside.

788
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:40,952
Thank you.

789
00:43:42,153 --> 00:43:43,588
'Cause I was way too
comfortable sleeping

790
00:43:43,588 --> 00:43:47,893
in my living room with the
game droning in the background.

791
00:43:47,893 --> 00:43:49,360
And Ben tells me this
isn't the first time

792
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,063
he's seen you guys tonight.

793
00:43:52,063 --> 00:43:53,331
- Yeah, about--

794
00:43:53,331 --> 00:43:55,133
- Do I even want to know?

795
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:58,036
- Well actually,
it's pretty funny.

796
00:44:00,205 --> 00:44:03,308
No sir, you do not wanna know.

797
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:06,144
- Well you three are
pretty goddam lucky.

798
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:09,715
Now I gotta let Ben win
next time we play golf.

799
00:44:09,715 --> 00:44:14,619
- Gives a whole new meaning
to support the troops.

800
00:44:14,619 --> 00:44:17,188
- They at least hold their own?

801
00:44:20,425 --> 00:44:23,094
- Yeah, yeah, I mean,
I knew Montgomery

802
00:44:23,094 --> 00:44:24,329
was full of piss and vinegar,

803
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:27,598
but even Whitmore was
a little impressive.

804
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,904
Could have been
just what they needed.

805
00:44:32,904 --> 00:44:33,739
- Yeah.

806
00:44:35,073 --> 00:44:37,075
Too bad though.

807
00:44:37,075 --> 00:44:38,343
- What?

808
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:39,945
- Shoulda called me earlier.

809
00:44:39,945 --> 00:44:41,747
Would have loved
to have seen it.

810
00:44:44,315 --> 00:44:47,052
I hear Marilyn
was there tonight.

811
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:53,792
Maybe you should go
by and see Marcus.

812
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:58,629
Might be a good thing
for all three of you.

813
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:01,632
- Yes sir.

814
00:45:04,669 --> 00:45:06,704
- I'll talk to you tomorrow.

815
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,373
- Tomorrow, yes sir.

816
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:40,371
- Who's this?

817
00:45:43,775 --> 00:45:46,511
- Remember that
woman at the bar?

818
00:45:48,446 --> 00:45:50,782
This is her husband, Marcus.

819
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:56,321
He's my friend.

820
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,391
- What happened?

821
00:46:08,299 --> 00:46:09,567
- Marcus and I,

822
00:46:09,567 --> 00:46:13,604
we were attached to the
First Infantry Division.

823
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:16,007
You know, round up any POW's,

824
00:46:17,843 --> 00:46:19,510
assist in transfers,

825
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:25,984
and uh, we were making
the push up to Um Kasar.

826
00:46:28,887 --> 00:46:30,221
Tuesday morning.

827
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,995
Some of the most
amazing sunrises

828
00:46:36,995 --> 00:46:39,330
and sunsets you'll ever see.

829
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,635
Nighttime is just stars from

830
00:46:46,771 --> 00:46:49,440
one end of the sky to the other.

831
00:46:53,178 --> 00:46:54,946
What a fuckin' waste.

832
00:47:00,952 --> 00:47:04,255
So Marcus and I were called
up to the front of the line

833
00:47:04,255 --> 00:47:05,523
and there's these two fuckers

834
00:47:05,523 --> 00:47:06,858
sitting right in the
middle of the road.

835
00:47:06,858 --> 00:47:09,427
I take one, he takes the other,

836
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:12,830
you don't think
about it beforehand,

837
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,933
you know, which one
you're gonna take,

838
00:47:14,933 --> 00:47:17,602
you don't think about it before.

839
00:47:22,607 --> 00:47:24,109
So Marcus is making his way up

840
00:47:24,109 --> 00:47:27,778
and he's got a shotgun
and I got my sidearm.

841
00:47:31,749 --> 00:47:32,984
There they are,

842
00:47:35,486 --> 00:47:38,756
just sitting in the
middle of the road,

843
00:47:38,756 --> 00:47:41,927
on their knees, they
got their arms up

844
00:47:44,162 --> 00:47:46,898
and they're just
waiting for out.

845
00:47:51,836 --> 00:47:55,006
So Marcus takes the
one on the right first

846
00:47:55,006 --> 00:47:57,342
and he shoulders his weapon.

847
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,915
Just as he's leaning down,

848
00:48:03,915 --> 00:48:06,918
this fucker reaches
up and grabs him

849
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:12,157
and Marcus is yelling and then
this fucker's yelling at him.

850
00:48:12,157 --> 00:48:13,658
This other fucker,
he takes off, right,

851
00:48:13,658 --> 00:48:15,860
so I'm yelling at him
to get on the ground

852
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:18,363
and then I look back at Marcus

853
00:48:20,198 --> 00:48:21,699
and then I see it.

854
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:28,239
You know, this
asshole's got a grenade

855
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:31,676
and he does not plan
on being a detainee.

856
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:40,251
So Marcus, he's trying
to get a hold of him

857
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,054
and he sees the grenade

858
00:48:45,223 --> 00:48:48,659
and he's got this
weird look on his face,

859
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:52,430
it's like he knows.

860
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:56,601
This is it.

861
00:49:01,206 --> 00:49:02,040
And then,

862
00:49:05,743 --> 00:49:07,412
limbs flying, blood,

863
00:49:10,215 --> 00:49:12,050
there's lots of blood.

864
00:49:18,256 --> 00:49:20,358
He hung on for about a
year and then I guess

865
00:49:20,358 --> 00:49:22,093
he'd just had enough.

866
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:29,200
He died during
his 9th operation.

867
00:49:41,412 --> 00:49:44,882
So every time I see
Marilyn, she gets a drink.

868
00:49:48,386 --> 00:49:51,122
- What happened
to the other POW?

869
00:49:58,063 --> 00:49:59,497
- I took him out.

870
00:50:10,775 --> 00:50:14,011
There's two things they
never prepare you for,

871
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:17,082
everything else you
learn pretty quick

872
00:50:17,082 --> 00:50:20,085
'cause if you don't,
you end up dead

873
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:24,589
or you end up like Marcus.

874
00:50:29,094 --> 00:50:31,929
They never prepare
you for leaving

875
00:50:34,565 --> 00:50:35,733
or coming home

876
00:50:41,406 --> 00:50:45,710
or how to deal with feeling
guilty about coming home

877
00:50:50,415 --> 00:50:51,649
and missing it.

878
00:51:04,762 --> 00:51:06,097
Come on.

879
00:51:52,377 --> 00:51:54,078
Thank you.

880
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,382
- Well, enjoy tomorrow.

881
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:04,689
We are officially
at D-Day, minus one.

882
00:52:08,526 --> 00:52:11,262
You let me know if
you need anything.

883
00:52:11,262 --> 00:52:12,597
Okay.

884
00:52:14,432 --> 00:52:17,435
Well I'll see you
guys at formation.

885
00:52:36,921 --> 00:52:39,224
- We got one more stop to make.

886
00:52:39,224 --> 00:52:40,225
- What's up?

887
00:52:59,577 --> 00:53:00,778
You know, I think
we've pretty much

888
00:53:00,778 --> 00:53:03,381
used up all our
favors for tonight.

889
00:53:03,381 --> 00:53:04,949
- Relax.

890
00:53:04,949 --> 00:53:06,251
Come on.

891
00:53:06,251 --> 00:53:07,518
Shit.

892
00:53:21,566 --> 00:53:23,100
- You ever use one of
those for this before?

893
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,936
No, I can't
say that I have.

894
00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:27,405
- It's pretty easy,

895
00:53:27,405 --> 00:53:30,775
I don't think I gotta
give you any instructions.

896
00:53:38,249 --> 00:53:39,684
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

897
00:53:39,684 --> 00:53:40,918
- What the hell's going on?

898
00:53:40,918 --> 00:53:41,719
- I didn't really think
you were gonna do it.

899
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:42,853
- You just told me to.

900
00:53:42,853 --> 00:53:44,822
- And I was just checking.

901
00:53:44,822 --> 00:53:46,791
Jesus Christ, okay.

902
00:53:46,791 --> 00:53:48,092
- All right, all right.

903
00:53:48,092 --> 00:53:49,660
I actually need your help.

904
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:53,030
You have used a
flashlight before, right?

905
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:54,265
- Is that right?

906
00:53:54,265 --> 00:53:57,635
- All right, all right,
shine it right there.

907
00:54:08,813 --> 00:54:09,980
All right, let's go.

908
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:10,815
- What?

909
00:54:14,218 --> 00:54:17,855
Jesus, you really love
your coffee, don't you?

910
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:18,756
- Let's go!

911
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:28,325
* Even if you
don't remember us *

912
00:55:29,226 --> 00:55:31,796
* You're everything I wanted

913
00:55:31,796 --> 00:55:32,630
Hey.

914
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:33,564
- Hey.

915
00:55:33,564 --> 00:55:35,065
- Hey David, you're in early.

916
00:55:35,065 --> 00:55:36,767
- Wouldn't wanna miss the
favorite part of my day.

917
00:55:36,767 --> 00:55:38,736
- Oh, how sweet.

918
00:55:38,736 --> 00:55:40,170
- Yeah, isn't it?

919
00:55:42,006 --> 00:55:44,108
- It's a tough one today.

920
00:55:45,242 --> 00:55:47,211
- Who comes up with
these questions?

921
00:55:47,211 --> 00:55:48,045
- Stumped?

922
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:56,921
- Everything's squared away,

923
00:55:56,921 --> 00:56:00,224
so I can pick up right
where I left off.

924
00:56:03,594 --> 00:56:06,130
- So where would you
like to eat tonight?

925
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:09,967
There's a nice little Mexican
place next to the hotel.

926
00:56:09,967 --> 00:56:13,237
- Actually, I was planning
on doing something

927
00:56:13,237 --> 00:56:14,439
with my friends tonight.

928
00:56:14,439 --> 00:56:17,141
So we can eat early,
if that's okay?

929
00:56:17,141 --> 00:56:20,511
You know, it's like
a surprise party,

930
00:56:20,511 --> 00:56:22,680
but not really a surprise.

931
00:56:32,823 --> 00:56:34,492
- Whatever you want.

932
00:56:39,564 --> 00:56:40,397
- Is dad,

933
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:44,569
- Well he,

934
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:50,741
work has been very
busy with him lately.

935
00:56:54,311 --> 00:56:56,046
I don't know, Robert.

936
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:03,320
- It's okay, mom.

937
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:07,525
- No, it isn't.

938
00:57:09,694 --> 00:57:10,528
- I know.

939
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:34,485
- You know, you can
invite your friend, Jenny,

940
00:57:34,485 --> 00:57:35,319
with us tonight.

941
00:57:35,319 --> 00:57:36,921
I've never met her.

942
00:57:38,255 --> 00:57:40,558
This Mexican place
oughta be pretty good.

943
00:57:40,558 --> 00:57:42,059
They say that their Jalapenos

944
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:45,129
will make you sweat
in three seconds.

945
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:16,326
Daddy!

946
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:19,296
Hey kiddo,
how was your piano lesson?

947
00:58:19,296 --> 00:58:21,065
- I got a dinosaur sticker.

948
00:58:21,065 --> 00:58:21,899
- You did?

949
00:58:21,899 --> 00:58:23,433
That's great!

950
00:58:23,433 --> 00:58:24,935
- Honey, why don't you go
put your piano books away.

951
00:58:24,935 --> 00:58:26,270
Okay.

952
00:58:33,377 --> 00:58:37,147
- So what, you want me
to give you that list?

953
00:58:39,216 --> 00:58:41,518
- I had that one coming.

954
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:44,254
- Well since you're here, there
are a couple other things.

955
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:47,892
There's a couple boards on
the deck that keep coming up.

956
00:58:47,892 --> 00:58:49,259
- I can do that.

957
00:58:49,259 --> 00:58:50,961
Are you sure?

958
00:58:50,961 --> 00:58:52,597
- Yeah.

959
00:58:52,597 --> 00:58:54,164
- Yeah?

960
00:58:54,164 --> 00:58:55,966
Yeah.

961
00:58:55,966 --> 00:58:59,069
- Okay, I'm just gonna go
inside and check on Rachel.

962
00:58:59,069 --> 00:59:01,071
- Okay, I'll finish up out here

963
00:59:01,071 --> 00:59:02,740
and I'll get started
on those boards.

964
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:05,042
Okay, do you
want something to drink?

965
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:07,344
- No, no, I got coffee
in the truck, but thanks.

966
00:59:07,344 --> 00:59:08,178
- Okay.

967
00:59:12,216 --> 00:59:15,552
Or, you know, you
could stay for dinner.

968
00:59:16,721 --> 00:59:19,223
I'm sure Rachel would love it.

969
00:59:22,593 --> 00:59:27,297
- Yeah, yeah, it'd be nice
to have dinner with her.

970
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:30,000
Okay, I mean, it's just
lasagna, of course.

971
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,101
Her favorite.

972
00:59:33,604 --> 00:59:35,505
- Sounds great.

973
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:36,641
Great.

974
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:50,087
* I can't remember
how I got here *

975
00:59:54,058 --> 00:59:59,063
* I've got a hazy memory

976
01:00:03,133 --> 01:00:07,905
* I need to rest
my aching head *

977
01:00:07,905 --> 01:00:12,910
* On your pillow and blankets

978
01:00:16,647 --> 01:00:21,218
* Maybe if I could fall asleep

979
01:00:21,218 --> 01:00:26,223
* My love will come back to me

980
01:00:27,591 --> 01:00:30,928
* This cannot be happening

981
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:39,203
* I'm losing you, losing
all our memories *

982
01:00:47,077 --> 01:00:48,746
The same questions
that I get from my mother

983
01:00:48,746 --> 01:00:50,881
every time I go home, oh man.

984
01:00:50,881 --> 01:00:53,350
My mother's upset over the
fact that I am divorced.

985
01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:54,651
Every time I go
home, same question,

986
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:55,953
when are you gonna
get married again?

987
01:00:55,953 --> 01:00:57,254
When are you gonna
get married again?

988
01:00:57,254 --> 01:00:57,955
When are you gonna
get married again?

989
01:00:57,955 --> 01:00:59,223
When ma, when?

990
01:00:59,223 --> 01:01:00,457
When the pope has a
saint at the Ponderosa

991
01:01:00,457 --> 01:01:01,258
on a Good Friday,
back off, all right?

992
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:10,968
* I need someone to comfort me

993
01:01:10,968 --> 01:01:15,973
* The tears are
rolling off my cheeks *

994
01:01:19,977 --> 01:01:24,381
* Maybe if I could
fall *

995
01:01:24,381 --> 01:01:26,616
- Hey you, where you going?

996
01:01:28,986 --> 01:01:31,155
- I have an exam tomorrow.

997
01:01:32,923 --> 01:01:35,259
- Okay, I thought you would,

998
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:39,363
- Goodbye, Robert.

999
01:01:57,915 --> 01:01:58,715
- Bye.

1000
01:02:12,396 --> 01:02:13,230
- Okay.

1001
01:02:14,698 --> 01:02:16,500
It is time for bed.

1002
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,135
I mean it this time.

1003
01:02:18,135 --> 01:02:19,904
- Can't we watch one more?

1004
01:02:19,904 --> 01:02:20,737
- Rachel.

1005
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:22,206
- Please?

1006
01:02:22,206 --> 01:02:23,874
- No, it's bedtime, come on.

1007
01:02:23,874 --> 01:02:26,443
- Yeah, listen to
your mom, kiddo, okay?

1008
01:02:26,443 --> 01:02:29,847
- But I wanna stay
down here with you.

1009
01:02:29,847 --> 01:02:32,850
- I know you do, but
it's time for bed

1010
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:35,319
and plus, I'll see
you tomorrow, right?

1011
01:02:35,319 --> 01:02:36,153
- I guess.

1012
01:02:37,387 --> 01:02:38,588
- Well I don't guess.

1013
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,925
I will see you tomorrow.

1014
01:02:40,925 --> 01:02:43,427
- Okay, love you, Daddy.

1015
01:02:43,427 --> 01:02:45,695
- Love you too, sweetheart.

1016
01:02:51,936 --> 01:02:53,403
- Are you leaving?

1017
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:58,342
- Well yeah, I mean,

1018
01:02:58,342 --> 01:02:59,977
I just thought that,

1019
01:03:01,478 --> 01:03:03,313
Oh.

1020
01:03:03,313 --> 01:03:04,248
Yeah, okay.

1021
01:03:11,421 --> 01:03:14,158
David, what are
you so scared of?

1022
01:03:17,494 --> 01:03:20,164
Don't you think that I'm scared?

1023
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:23,067
I am so scared for you.

1024
01:03:24,368 --> 01:03:27,537
I'm scared for her,
I'm scared for me.

1025
01:03:28,906 --> 01:03:32,742
I mean, what if you don't
come back this time?

1026
01:03:36,746 --> 01:03:37,915
You know what?

1027
01:03:39,216 --> 01:03:40,017
Just go.

1028
01:03:45,355 --> 01:03:47,591
God, how dare you.

1029
01:03:47,591 --> 01:03:49,960
God, how can you
go there and fight?

1030
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,395
And we're right here.

1031
01:03:51,395 --> 01:03:55,399
David, I am right here
and you can't face this.

1032
01:03:55,399 --> 01:03:57,301
- I don't know how to--

1033
01:03:58,468 --> 01:04:02,372
Just leave.

1034
01:04:03,473 --> 01:04:04,574
- Look, I just--

1035
01:04:04,574 --> 01:04:05,675
- Just leave.

1036
01:04:57,427 --> 01:05:01,698
* I waited for our
house, our house *

1037
01:05:10,774 --> 01:05:14,111
* I've made it my, mine

1038
01:05:24,121 --> 01:05:27,791
* No speak, no sound, sound

1039
01:05:37,434 --> 01:05:40,770
* I've waited for hours

1040
01:06:01,091 --> 01:06:06,096
* But I'm not awake, I'm
not awake, I'm not awake *

1041
01:06:12,502 --> 01:06:14,571
* I must be dreaming

1042
01:06:14,571 --> 01:06:19,576
* I'm not awake, I'm not
awake, I'm not awake *

1043
01:06:31,488 --> 01:06:32,722
Major, we have
our troop movement orders

1044
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:33,857
ready and available.

1045
01:06:33,857 --> 01:06:35,359
- All right, gentlemen,
let's have them

1046
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:37,527
do their final goodbyes and
we'll do a final headcount

1047
01:06:37,527 --> 01:06:39,296
as we get on the bus to
head to the flight line.

1048
01:06:39,296 --> 01:06:40,597
- Roger that, sir.

1049
01:06:40,597 --> 01:06:41,865
Sir, the
vans are ready.

1050
01:06:41,865 --> 01:06:44,801
- Excellent, let's make
this happen, gentlemen.

1051
01:06:44,801 --> 01:06:48,305
- I picked up your
ring from the jewelers.

1052
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,576
- You know what?

1053
01:06:52,576 --> 01:06:55,745
Keep it, I'll get
it when I come back.

1054
01:07:09,759 --> 01:07:11,328
- Take care of him.

1055
01:07:13,263 --> 01:07:14,764
- I'll do my best.

1056
01:07:18,202 --> 01:07:21,037
Call Jeannie if
you need anything.

1057
01:07:23,006 --> 01:07:24,574
See you in the van.

1058
01:07:44,261 --> 01:07:45,095
Private.

1059
01:07:47,464 --> 01:07:48,298
Robert.

1060
01:07:52,202 --> 01:07:53,637
- First Sergeant.

1061
01:07:58,542 --> 01:08:01,578
- Could be stuck in traffic.

1062
01:08:01,578 --> 01:08:02,979
- Yeah, probably.

1063
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:06,850
- Listen,

1064
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,356
- Mom.

1065
01:08:12,356 --> 01:08:15,692
Oh my boy.

1066
01:08:19,963 --> 01:08:23,900
- Oh mom, this is
First Sergeant Solomon.

1067
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:25,702
First Sergeant, this is my mom.

1068
01:08:25,702 --> 01:08:27,437
- Please, David.

1069
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:29,506
Pleasure to meet you, ma'am.

1070
01:08:29,506 --> 01:08:31,575
- Nice to meet you too, David.

1071
01:08:31,575 --> 01:08:34,178
You're gonna watch out
for my boy, aren't you?

1072
01:08:34,178 --> 01:08:36,580
- Yes ma'am, I'll do my best.

1073
01:08:37,781 --> 01:08:39,716
And you must be Mr. Montgomery?

1074
01:08:39,716 --> 01:08:41,017
- Yes.

1075
01:08:41,017 --> 01:08:43,687
- You should both be
very proud of your son.

1076
01:08:43,687 --> 01:08:44,854
- Yes, we are.

1077
01:08:49,058 --> 01:08:52,028
- I'll leave you to
say your goodbyes.

1078
01:08:52,028 --> 01:08:53,597
See you on the van.

1079
01:09:02,339 --> 01:09:06,343
- You let us know where we
can send you some real food.

1080
01:09:06,343 --> 01:09:10,113
I imagine you'll be sick
of those Army meals.

1081
01:09:19,756 --> 01:09:23,593
- Well I want to introduce
you to my sergeant.

1082
01:09:34,638 --> 01:09:35,472
- Daddy!

1083
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:38,342
- Oh.

1084
01:09:39,843 --> 01:09:40,944
Oh hey kiddo.

1085
01:09:42,546 --> 01:09:44,214
I like your outfit.

1086
01:09:44,214 --> 01:09:46,716
Oh.

1087
01:09:46,716 --> 01:09:47,984
Thank you.

1088
01:09:47,984 --> 01:09:50,920
So when are
you coming back home?

1089
01:09:58,795 --> 01:10:00,063
- I don't know.

1090
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:05,502
- I brought you this just
in case you get homesick.

1091
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:08,705
- Did you make this?

1092
01:10:18,348 --> 01:10:22,619
It's the best thing I'm
gonna be taking with me.

1093
01:10:22,619 --> 01:10:24,621
- Are you scared, daddy?

1094
01:10:30,294 --> 01:10:32,796
- Yeah, a little bit.

1095
01:10:32,796 --> 01:10:35,332
I was when
I went to summer camp.

1096
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:39,636
I wish you didn't have to go.

1097
01:10:42,272 --> 01:10:43,072
- Me too.

1098
01:10:44,641 --> 01:10:47,010
I love you, daddy.

1099
01:10:51,948 --> 01:10:53,317
- I love you too.

1100
01:11:03,327 --> 01:11:04,160
Thank you.

1101
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:14,704
- You have to go.

1102
01:11:18,375 --> 01:11:19,309
- Mm, yeah.

1103
01:11:40,997 --> 01:11:42,332
I'm coming back.

1104
01:11:45,769 --> 01:11:49,238
We'll be here.

1105
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:40,023
- Captain, first squad's
secured, ready to move out.

1106
01:12:40,023 --> 01:12:41,324
- Excellent job.

1107
01:12:41,324 --> 01:12:42,158
You ready?

1108
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:45,228
- Let's do it.

1109
01:12:45,228 --> 01:12:46,563
- Let's go then.

1110
01:13:11,655 --> 01:13:13,990
- I gotta ask you something.

1111
01:13:15,459 --> 01:13:16,292
- What?

1112
01:13:18,728 --> 01:13:19,963
- What in the hell were we doing

1113
01:13:19,963 --> 01:13:21,665
at the coffee shop
the other night?

1114
01:13:24,934 --> 01:13:26,803
- Well, after they close,

1115
01:13:26,803 --> 01:13:30,239
they put the trivia up on the
board for the next morning.

1116
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:34,744
They don't know how, but I
get it right every morning.

1117
01:13:38,181 --> 01:13:43,019
- And you're just leaving
without clearing your conscious?

1118
01:13:46,155 --> 01:13:48,825
- I'll tell her when I get back.

1119
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:37,761
* Today I got the call

1120
01:16:37,761 --> 01:16:41,330
* That changes it all

1121
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:46,335
* I need you to understand

1122
01:16:49,305 --> 01:16:54,310
* That I made a choice
to use my voice *

1123
01:16:55,211 --> 01:17:00,216
* And get up and take a stand

1124
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:05,822
* For you

1125
01:17:06,723 --> 01:17:11,094
* If something happened to you

1126
01:17:12,428 --> 01:17:17,433
* I wouldn't be the
man who said I do *

1127
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:23,673
* So I'll go for now

1128
01:17:23,673 --> 01:17:27,576
* Save my place until I return

1129
01:17:37,453 --> 01:17:42,125
* Inside I know, I
know it burns always *

1130
01:17:48,932 --> 01:17:52,769
* Know I'll be standing guard

1131
01:17:59,442 --> 01:18:02,779
* And watching from afar

1132
01:18:24,033 --> 01:18:27,636
* I'll keep you safe from harm

1133
01:18:27,636 --> 01:18:31,274
* Brothers in arms

1134
01:18:31,274 --> 01:18:36,279
* You were always there for me

1135
01:18:38,782 --> 01:18:42,385
* And if I come to call

1136
01:18:42,385 --> 01:18:47,390
* Your hero will fall, but I'll
leave you the memory always *

1137
01:18:56,299 --> 01:19:01,237
* If something happened to you

1138
01:19:02,705 --> 01:19:07,710
* I wouldn't be the
brother that you knew *

1139
01:19:10,713 --> 01:19:13,716
* So I must go for now

1140
01:19:13,716 --> 01:19:17,620
* Save my place until I return

1141
01:19:27,563 --> 01:19:32,301
* Inside I know, I
know it burns brother *

1142
01:19:38,741 --> 01:19:42,578
* Know I'll be standing guard

1143
01:19:49,252 --> 01:19:52,655
* And watching from afar
