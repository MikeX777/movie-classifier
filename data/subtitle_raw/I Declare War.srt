1
00:00:23,387 --> 00:00:26,288
( radio chatter continues )

2
00:00:30,227 --> 00:00:32,495
( whispering )
STAY DOWN.

3
00:00:32,497 --> 00:00:35,364
DID YOU SEE ANYONE?

4
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:39,735
GO.

5
00:00:53,283 --> 00:00:55,718
( gun fires )

6
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,153
( grunts )

7
00:00:57,155 --> 00:00:59,655
DOWN, DOWN!
I NEED A GRENADE!

8
00:00:59,657 --> 00:01:02,458
ONE STEAMBOAT,
TWO STEAMBOATS...

9
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,761
THREE STEAMBOATS...
WHERE ARE YOU GUYS?

10
00:01:05,763 --> 00:01:07,329
FOUR STEAMBOATS...

11
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:10,266
FIVE STEAMBOATS,
SIX STEAMBOATS,

12
00:01:10,268 --> 00:01:11,434
SEVEN STEAMBOATS...

13
00:01:11,436 --> 00:01:13,469
I NEED A FUCKIN'
GRENADE!

14
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:15,471
NINE STEAMBOATS...
( fires )

15
00:01:15,473 --> 00:01:17,840
TEN STEAMBOATS!

16
00:01:25,282 --> 00:01:27,750
NO, IT'S YOURS.

17
00:01:27,752 --> 00:01:30,653
( explosion
sound echoes )

18
00:01:30,655 --> 00:01:32,488
YOU'RE DEAD.

19
00:01:39,496 --> 00:01:41,263
KENNEY,
HAVE YOU KILLED

20
00:01:41,265 --> 00:01:43,566
NO.
ANY OF OURS

21
00:01:43,568 --> 00:01:45,568
NO.
I JUST SAW JOKER.

22
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,804
WHAT ABOUT THEM?
WE KNOW SCOTT'S DEAD.

23
00:01:48,806 --> 00:01:50,806
YEAH, WHO ELSE?

24
00:01:50,808 --> 00:01:53,576
THEN WE'LL ASSUME
THEY'RE ALL ALIVE.

25
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:55,744
I NEED TO KNOW WHERE
QUINN'S BASE IS.

26
00:01:55,746 --> 00:01:56,912
YOU TWO,
GO ON RECON.

27
00:01:56,914 --> 00:01:59,582
CHECK EVERYWHERE
WE'VE USED BEFORE.

28
00:01:59,584 --> 00:02:01,750
FUCK THAT.
WE CAN FIND OUT

29
00:02:01,752 --> 00:02:04,453
OW!
HEY!

30
00:02:04,455 --> 00:02:06,322
WHERE'S YOUR BASE?
SCREW OFF!

31
00:02:06,324 --> 00:02:09,725
YOU CAN'T INTERROGATE
THE DEAD!

32
00:02:09,727 --> 00:02:11,360
LEAVE HIM ALONE.
WHAT?

33
00:02:11,362 --> 00:02:13,596
HE'S RIGHT.
ONCE YOU'RE DEAD,

34
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:16,332
YOU CAN'T BE
INTERROGATED.

35
00:02:16,334 --> 00:02:18,501
FUCK THE RULES.
IT'S TOO HOT FOR RULES.

36
00:02:18,503 --> 00:02:22,771
I'M NOT A CHEATER.
GO HOME, SCOTT.

37
00:02:28,845 --> 00:02:30,746
I'M GOING TO WIN
FAIR AND SQUARE.

38
00:02:30,748 --> 00:02:32,314
YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE
FAIR AND SQUARE.

39
00:02:32,316 --> 00:02:35,784
DUDE, THIS IS P.K.
HE DOESN'T LOSE.

40
00:02:35,786 --> 00:02:38,254
LOSE WHAT?
HIS VIRGINITY?

41
00:02:38,256 --> 00:02:39,655
I HEARD HE LOST IT
TO YOUR MOM.

42
00:02:39,657 --> 00:02:41,290
WHAT DID YOU SAY,
ASS-FACE?

43
00:02:41,292 --> 00:02:42,424
STOP IT, NOW!

44
00:02:42,426 --> 00:02:46,762
I WANT A TACTICAL
STRATEGY ASSIMILATION

45
00:02:46,764 --> 00:02:48,797
NOW, GO!

46
00:02:56,506 --> 00:03:00,809
SO, WHERE THE HELL
WERE YOU WHEN I WAS

47
00:03:00,811 --> 00:03:02,211
KENNEY WAS THERE.

48
00:03:02,213 --> 00:03:04,213
YOU DIDN'T KNOW
HE WAS THERE.

49
00:03:04,215 --> 00:03:06,515
SURE I DID.
OKAY, YEAH, WELL--

50
00:03:06,517 --> 00:03:08,751
YOU STILL SENT ME
OUT THERE TO GET SHOT,

51
00:03:08,753 --> 00:03:09,919
TO GET SCOTT TO COME OUT?

52
00:03:09,921 --> 00:03:14,323
ONLY BECAUSE I KNEW
KENNEY WAS THERE AND

53
00:03:14,325 --> 00:03:17,259
DON'T WORRY, PAUL.
WE'RE A TEAM.

54
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:18,460
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
AFTER THE WAR?

55
00:03:18,462 --> 00:03:23,799
YOU'RE COMING OVER,
AND WE'RE EATING PIZZA

56
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:25,334
WHAT MOVIE?

57
00:03:25,336 --> 00:03:26,735
<i>PATTON?</i>

58
00:03:26,737 --> 00:03:29,238
AGAIN?
YES.

59
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,676
NOW GET OUT THERE
SO I CAN WIN THIS WAR.

60
00:03:36,813 --> 00:03:40,649
( gun firing sounds )

61
00:04:31,768 --> 00:04:34,970
P.K.'S YOUR BEST
FRIEND, RIGHT?

62
00:04:34,972 --> 00:04:37,606
HE'S KIND OF AN ASSHOLE.

63
00:04:37,608 --> 00:04:40,442
NO, HE'S NOT.
WITH ALL HIS

64
00:04:40,444 --> 00:04:41,710
OH, YOU THINK IT'S
A COINCIDENCE

65
00:04:41,712 --> 00:04:44,880
THAT HE'S WON EVERY
SINGLE GAME OF WAR

66
00:04:44,882 --> 00:04:46,949
C'MON,
JUST FOLLOW YOUR ORDERS.

67
00:04:46,951 --> 00:04:49,752
FIND THE BASE,
THEN GO BACK TO P.K.?

68
00:04:49,754 --> 00:04:51,720
THAT'S THE STUPIDEST
THING I'VE EVER HEARD.

69
00:04:51,722 --> 00:04:54,857
IF WE FIND THE BASE,
LET'S JUST KILL EVERYONE

70
00:04:54,859 --> 00:04:55,691
SHUT UP!

71
00:04:55,693 --> 00:04:57,626
YOU THINK QUINN
DOESN'T HAVE A PLAN?

72
00:04:57,628 --> 00:04:59,061
HE'S BEEN PLANNING
THIS WAR

73
00:04:59,063 --> 00:05:00,596
AGAINST P.K.
FOR MONTHS NOW.

74
00:05:00,598 --> 00:05:01,997
AND YOU'RE GONNA
SCREW IT ALL UP.

75
00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:04,667
YOU'RE SUCH A BITCH
RIGHT NOW.

76
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:08,103
YOU'RE P.K.'S BITCH.
I'M NOBODY'S BITCH.

77
00:05:08,105 --> 00:05:09,705
I'M GONNA MARCH RIGHT
INTO THEIR BASE,

78
00:05:09,707 --> 00:05:11,640
STICK MY GUN RIGHT
IN QUINN'S STUPID FACE,

79
00:05:11,642 --> 00:05:14,410
BLOW HIS HEAD OFF,
SHOOT EVERYONE ELSE,

80
00:05:14,412 --> 00:05:17,680
GRAB THE FLAG--
AAH!

81
00:05:20,417 --> 00:05:20,983
SKINNER.

82
00:05:20,985 --> 00:05:26,055
WELL, IF IT ISN'T SOME
OF P.K.'S LITTLE SOLDIERS...

83
00:05:26,057 --> 00:05:30,559
AND THE GENERAL'S
BEST FRIEND.

84
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,765
WE RULE.

85
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:40,402
( coughs )
OW!

86
00:05:40,404 --> 00:05:42,571
GRAB HIS GUN.
WHAT?

87
00:05:42,573 --> 00:05:43,739
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

88
00:05:43,741 --> 00:05:46,442
WHY?
YOU GONNA TELL

89
00:05:46,444 --> 00:05:48,877
KICK HIM AGAIN,
SIKORSKI.

90
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:52,715
AAGH!
( winces, groans )

91
00:05:55,151 --> 00:05:57,586
GRAB HIM.

92
00:05:58,755 --> 00:06:00,989
A GIRL.

93
00:06:00,991 --> 00:06:04,526
YOU'RE A GIRL.
SORRY.

94
00:06:04,528 --> 00:06:06,628
I CAN HELP,
THOUGH.

95
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,563
SURE.

96
00:06:07,565 --> 00:06:10,532
YOU CAN BE THE ARTS
AND CRAFTS SQUADRON.

97
00:06:10,534 --> 00:06:13,168
SINCE WHEN DO GIRLS
EVEN LIKE WAR?

98
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:16,739
ACTUALLY, THIS IS
MY FIRST WAR.

99
00:06:16,741 --> 00:06:18,073
GOD...

100
00:06:18,075 --> 00:06:20,743
I DUNNO.
I CAN APPRECIATE WAR.

101
00:06:20,745 --> 00:06:23,846
STRATEGY, TACTICS,
STUFF LIKE THAT.

102
00:06:23,848 --> 00:06:25,714
LIKE CHESS.

103
00:06:25,716 --> 00:06:26,915
YOU PLAY CHESS?

104
00:06:26,917 --> 00:06:29,985
YEAH, I PLAY
A LOT OF CHESS.

105
00:06:29,987 --> 00:06:32,421
HUH.
YEAH, ME TOO.

106
00:06:32,423 --> 00:06:34,623
HM.
THAT'S FUNNY.

107
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:37,192
BUT DON'T GET ME WRONG.
I'M SERIOUS.

108
00:06:37,194 --> 00:06:41,663
I'LL KILL PEOPLE.
I HAVE KILLING

109
00:06:41,665 --> 00:06:44,433
LIKE WHAT?

110
00:06:44,435 --> 00:06:45,868
JUST, YOU KNOW...

111
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,670
TECHNIQUES.

112
00:06:48,672 --> 00:06:50,906
OKAY.

113
00:06:50,908 --> 00:06:53,909
LET ME SHOW YOU
SOMETHING.

114
00:07:01,017 --> 00:07:02,151
COOL.

115
00:07:02,153 --> 00:07:04,686
LOOK AT THIS.

116
00:07:05,622 --> 00:07:07,189
( beeps )

117
00:07:09,592 --> 00:07:11,493
OH, YOU'RE KIDDING.

118
00:07:11,495 --> 00:07:12,661
NOPE.

119
00:07:12,663 --> 00:07:13,929
DID YOU BUILD THAT?
YEAH.

120
00:07:13,931 --> 00:07:18,133
I MEAN, I GOT THE IDEA
OFF THE INTERNET,

121
00:07:18,135 --> 00:07:21,570
YOU GET IT, RIGHT?
WHAT IT'S FOR?

122
00:07:21,572 --> 00:07:22,971
A BOMB.

123
00:07:22,973 --> 00:07:24,039
A BOMB.

124
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,008
THAT'S THE BOMB.

125
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,176
( laughs )
YEAH.

126
00:07:27,178 --> 00:07:32,714
UNFORTUNATELY, IT CAN
ONLY CARRY THE WEIGHT

127
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:37,553
WHAT IF YOU BROKE
THE AMOUNT OF PAINT UP

128
00:07:37,555 --> 00:07:38,821
OR FIVE?
THOUGHT OF THAT.

129
00:07:38,823 --> 00:07:40,989
BUT THEN THE BALLOONS
AREN'T HEAVY ENOUGH

130
00:07:40,991 --> 00:07:42,891
TO BREAK OPEN WHEN
THEY LAND ON SOMEONE.

131
00:07:42,893 --> 00:07:47,262
WHAT IF YOU DIDN'T
TIE THEM CLOSED?

132
00:07:47,264 --> 00:07:48,197
YEAH.

133
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:49,932
JUST PUSH THE HOOK
THROUGH THE RUBBER,

134
00:07:49,934 --> 00:07:51,266
AND THEN WHEN
IT RETRACTS,

135
00:07:51,268 --> 00:07:54,203
THEY GET PUSHED OFF
THE HOOK AND FALL.

136
00:07:54,205 --> 00:07:56,004
THAT'S AWESOME.

137
00:07:56,006 --> 00:07:58,674
THAT'S REALLY GREAT.

138
00:07:59,142 --> 00:08:02,611
SORRY ABOUT THE ARTS
AND CRAFTS THING BEFORE.

139
00:08:02,613 --> 00:08:05,681
IT'S OKAY.
SORRY ABOUT

140
00:08:05,683 --> 00:08:08,016
WHEN DID YOU CALL ME
AN ASSHOLE?

141
00:08:08,018 --> 00:08:12,988
I DIDN'T.
BUT I WAS THINKING IT.

142
00:08:31,774 --> 00:08:35,244
WE HAVE TO BE READY
FOR ANYTHING.

143
00:08:35,246 --> 00:08:37,679
HE COULD SAP US.

144
00:08:37,681 --> 00:08:40,616
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

145
00:08:42,752 --> 00:08:47,256
DIG A TUNNEL RIGHT
UNDER OUR POSITION,

146
00:08:47,258 --> 00:08:52,728
A HAND STICKS OUT
OF THE GROUND AND SMASHES

147
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,030
YOU'RE DEAD.

148
00:08:56,299 --> 00:08:59,268
THIS IS THE FIRST GUY
I'VE FOUGHT WHO...

149
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,736
WHO ACTUALLY KNOWS
THIS STUFF.

150
00:09:00,738 --> 00:09:03,272
HE'S USING TACTICS,
HE'S USING STRATEGY.

151
00:09:03,274 --> 00:09:08,143
IN A WAY, THIS IS
THE FIRST REAL WAR

152
00:09:08,145 --> 00:09:12,281
WHICH IS WHY I HAVE
TO WIN IT.

153
00:09:12,283 --> 00:09:15,817
BUT YOU ALWAYS WIN.

154
00:09:15,819 --> 00:09:18,053
THIS IS DIFFERENT.

155
00:09:18,055 --> 00:09:20,889
THIS IS THE MOMENT
OF TRUTH.

156
00:09:20,891 --> 00:09:23,892
A REAL TEST OF WHAT
I'M GOOD AT.

157
00:09:23,894 --> 00:09:26,862
YOU MEAN, BEING
A KNOW-IT-ALL DICK?

158
00:09:26,864 --> 00:09:28,764
NO,
HE MEANS WAR.

159
00:09:28,766 --> 00:09:30,599
HEY!
YOU GET PICKED LAST,

160
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:33,969
YOU DON'T TALK BACK
TO SUPERIOR OFFICERS.

161
00:09:33,971 --> 00:09:36,238
WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU WEARING?

162
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,075
IT'S A BANDOLIER.
FOR SHOTGUN SHELLS.

163
00:09:40,077 --> 00:09:42,010
FOR YOUR TOY
AIR RIFLE?

164
00:09:42,012 --> 00:09:44,379
BACK OFF, JOKER.

165
00:09:44,381 --> 00:09:45,881
HE'S OUR PRIEST.

166
00:09:45,883 --> 00:09:48,317
OUR PRIEST?
THAT'S RIGHT.

167
00:09:48,319 --> 00:09:49,718
EVERY UNIT
NEEDS A PRIEST.

168
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,122
TO WRITE LETTERS HOME
FOR THE MEN WHO HAVE

169
00:09:54,124 --> 00:09:57,693
DOES HE JERK
THEM OFF, TOO?

170
00:09:58,962 --> 00:10:00,796
HEY!
WE NEED TO BE

171
00:10:00,798 --> 00:10:03,131
BESIDES, THESE ARE
AGAINST THE RULES,

172
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:05,367
I WASN'T USING IT
TO CALL ANYBODY.

173
00:10:05,369 --> 00:10:08,937
YOU CAN HAVE IT BACK
AFTER THE WAR.

174
00:10:18,281 --> 00:10:21,350
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

175
00:10:21,985 --> 00:10:24,252
Kenney:
SULLIVAN!

176
00:10:25,655 --> 00:10:27,055
WHOA.

177
00:10:27,057 --> 00:10:28,790
YOU CAN'T BE HERE.

178
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:31,293
AH, FUCK YOUR RULES,
P.K.

179
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,694
LOOK WHAT THEY DID TO ME.

180
00:10:32,696 --> 00:10:35,063
YOU THINK THEY
GIVE A SHIT ABOUT

181
00:10:35,065 --> 00:10:38,367
I'M HERE TO TALK
TO JOKER.

182
00:10:39,802 --> 00:10:45,674
FINE.
BUT ONLY ABOUT THEIR

183
00:10:45,676 --> 00:10:47,976
WHAT HAPPENED?
SKINNER.

184
00:10:47,978 --> 00:10:49,111
HE TOOK KWON PRISONER,

185
00:10:49,113 --> 00:10:52,114
AND THEN THAT BITCH
SIKORSKI KICKED

186
00:10:52,116 --> 00:10:53,849
HE TOOK KWON
PRISONER?

187
00:10:53,851 --> 00:10:58,120
I WANT YOU TO FIND THEM
AND I WANT YOU TO STOMP

188
00:10:58,122 --> 00:11:01,256
YEAH.
DEFINITELY.

189
00:11:01,258 --> 00:11:04,326
SKINNER?
YES.

190
00:11:04,328 --> 00:11:07,863
DIDN'T KNOW HE
HAD IT IN HIM.

191
00:11:07,865 --> 00:11:10,966
YOU DON'T KNOW
A LOT OF THINGS.

192
00:11:10,968 --> 00:11:13,035
UH...
KENNEY.

193
00:11:13,037 --> 00:11:13,869
THANKS.

194
00:11:13,871 --> 00:11:16,905
YOU'LL GET
A SPECIAL CITATION

195
00:11:16,907 --> 00:11:19,141
SCREW OFF.

196
00:11:20,743 --> 00:11:21,977
WE HAVE TO MOVE FAST.

197
00:11:21,979 --> 00:11:23,445
QUINN'S NOT GOING TO GO
FOR A PRISONER.

198
00:11:23,447 --> 00:11:26,081
HE'LL KILL KWON AS SOON
AS SKINNER BRINGS HIM IN.

199
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:29,217
WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE
TO GET TO HIM BEFORE

200
00:11:29,219 --> 00:11:33,722
JOKER, GET ME CALEB.
CALEB?

201
00:11:33,724 --> 00:11:35,157
HE DOESN'T EVEN
CARRY A WEAPON.

202
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:40,162
CALEB <i>IS</i> A WEAPON.
TAKE WESLEY.

203
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:43,732
I'LL STAY HERE
AND GUARD THE FLAG.

204
00:11:43,734 --> 00:11:45,434
OKAY?

205
00:11:45,436 --> 00:11:48,203
OKAY?

206
00:11:51,107 --> 00:11:54,242
OKAY.

207
00:11:59,515 --> 00:12:04,519
NOBODY TAKES MY
BEST FRIEND PRISONER.

208
00:12:07,957 --> 00:12:12,060
HE KNOWS YOU'RE SMART.
HE'S GONNA BE EXPECTING

209
00:12:12,062 --> 00:12:14,196
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
JUST RUSH HIM.

210
00:12:14,198 --> 00:12:15,797
CAN'T JUST RUSH HIM.

211
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:17,899
HE'S WAY TOO SMART
FOR THAT.

212
00:12:17,901 --> 00:12:21,169
BUT... I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

213
00:12:21,171 --> 00:12:23,038
MAYBE I'M
OVERTHINKING IT.

214
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,006
THIS ISN'T
THE HUNDRED YEARS WAR.

215
00:12:25,008 --> 00:12:28,977
HE'S ONLY GOT FIVE GUYS.
HE'S NOT FRANCE.

216
00:12:30,513 --> 00:12:32,981
FRANCE.

217
00:12:32,983 --> 00:12:35,183
WHAT ABOUT FRANCE?

218
00:12:35,185 --> 00:12:37,819
SORRY.
I LOVE FRANCE.

219
00:12:37,821 --> 00:12:40,989
ME AND MY TWO BEST FRIENDS
HAVE A PACT TO GO TOGETHER

220
00:12:40,991 --> 00:12:43,992
FOR A YEAR
AFTER HIGH SCHOOL.

221
00:12:43,994 --> 00:12:45,460
OH.

222
00:12:45,462 --> 00:12:50,065
THEY JUST HAVE THE MOST
DELICIOUS FOOD,

223
00:12:50,067 --> 00:12:55,570
AND GREAT ARCHITECTURE,
AND PARIS.

224
00:12:55,572 --> 00:13:00,008
IT'S ALL JUST VERY...

225
00:13:08,184 --> 00:13:10,585
QUINN,
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

226
00:13:10,587 --> 00:13:14,055
WE ARE TALKING.

227
00:13:14,057 --> 00:13:15,957
I KNOW.

228
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:18,260
CAN I TELL YOU
SOMETHING?

229
00:13:18,262 --> 00:13:20,128
SURE.

230
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,564
I'M GLAD YOU PICKED ME
FOR YOUR TEAM.

231
00:13:22,566 --> 00:13:24,099
SURE.
NO PROBLEM.

232
00:13:24,101 --> 00:13:27,502
IT'S, UH, WORKING OUT
BETTER THAN I THOUGHT.

233
00:13:27,504 --> 00:13:34,376
I MEAN, I WAS KIND
OF HOPING YOU'D PICK ME.

234
00:13:34,378 --> 00:13:36,611
YOU WERE?

235
00:13:36,613 --> 00:13:40,215
YEAH.

236
00:13:40,217 --> 00:13:43,285
OH... OKAY, WELL,

237
00:13:43,287 --> 00:13:46,555
I'M GLAD WE COULD--
Skinner: WE'RE BACK.

238
00:13:52,395 --> 00:13:53,895
WHERE'S SCOTT?

239
00:13:53,897 --> 00:13:56,898
WE...
GOT SEPARATED.

240
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,999
BUT WE GOT
A PRISONER.

241
00:13:58,001 --> 00:13:59,401
I DON'T TAKE
PRISONERS.

242
00:13:59,403 --> 00:14:02,003
LOOK, LET ME EXPLAIN
MY PLAN--

243
00:14:02,005 --> 00:14:04,639
WHEN AND WHERE DID
YOU GET SEPARATED?

244
00:14:04,641 --> 00:14:05,640
LISTEN TO ME,
OKAY?

245
00:14:05,642 --> 00:14:08,076
LOOK,
THIS IS P.K.'S

246
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:11,012
WE HOLD HIM PRISONER.
WHEN P.K. TRIES

247
00:14:11,014 --> 00:14:12,948
WE AMBUSH HIM
AND WE TAKE HIM OUT.

248
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:16,685
WITHOUT P.K.,
THEIR TEAM FALLS APART,

249
00:14:16,687 --> 00:14:17,919
I DON'T LIKE IT.

250
00:14:17,921 --> 00:14:20,055
YOU DIDN'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT IT!

251
00:14:20,057 --> 00:14:21,890
P.K.'S TOO SMART
TO FALL FOR THIS.

252
00:14:21,892 --> 00:14:23,925
AND I DON'T LIKE
THIS IDEA ABOUT

253
00:14:23,927 --> 00:14:25,360
THERE'S NO RULE
ABOUT PRISONERS.

254
00:14:25,362 --> 00:14:28,496
THERE'S NO RULE
AGAINST PRISONERS.

255
00:14:28,498 --> 00:14:30,198
IT'S PAUL,
HIS BEST FRIEND.

256
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,267
HE'LL DO ANYTHING
TO SAVE--

257
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:34,069
HE'D SACRIFICE
HIS MOTHER TO WIN.

258
00:14:34,071 --> 00:14:37,539
HIS BEST FRIEND
MEANS NOTHING.

259
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,908
SORRY, KID...
WAIT!

260
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:43,211
LET'S JUST SEE WHAT
EVERYONE ELSE THINKS.

261
00:14:43,213 --> 00:14:45,480
YOU DON'T GET TO VOTE
IN THE ARMY.

262
00:14:45,482 --> 00:14:47,315
I'M NOT STUPID.

263
00:14:47,317 --> 00:14:48,383
DID YOU EVEN HEAR ME?

264
00:14:48,385 --> 00:14:50,218
QUINN'S THE LEADER.
LET HIM LEAD.

265
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:54,155
LOOK, WHEN SCOTT
GETS BACK, I'M SURE

266
00:14:54,157 --> 00:14:56,258
SCOTT'S DEAD.
WHAT?

267
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,493
YOU'RE LYING.
SHUT UP!

268
00:14:58,495 --> 00:15:00,929
KENNEY KILLED HIM
ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AGO

269
00:15:00,931 --> 00:15:03,131
IN THE FIELD NEAR
THE HYDRO TOWER.

270
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:04,366
P.K. AND I
WERE THERE.

271
00:15:04,368 --> 00:15:09,604
SCOTT KEPT CALLING
FOR BACKUP.

272
00:15:09,606 --> 00:15:11,273
FIRST,
I'M GONNA KILL HIM.

273
00:15:11,275 --> 00:15:14,676
THEN I WANNA HEAR HOW
YOU GOT SEPARATED FROM

274
00:15:14,678 --> 00:15:17,112
NOW, GIVE ME A GRENADE.

275
00:15:19,615 --> 00:15:20,982
NO.

276
00:15:20,984 --> 00:15:22,584
YOU'RE NOT
IN CHARGE HERE!

277
00:15:22,586 --> 00:15:26,254
YOU'RE A GRENADE CARRIER!
NOW, GIVE ME A GRENADE.

278
00:15:26,256 --> 00:15:28,023
YOU CAN'T KILL HIM!
SKINNER,

279
00:15:28,025 --> 00:15:29,557
YOU DON'T HAVE WHAT
IT TAKES TO LEAD,

280
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:31,326
AND YOU DON'T HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES

281
00:15:31,328 --> 00:15:33,128
TO BEAT A GENERAL
LIKE P.K. SULLIVAN.

282
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,030
NOW, SEE HER?
SHE'S SMART.

283
00:15:35,032 --> 00:15:37,532
SHE COULD DO IT.
BUT NOT YOU.

284
00:15:37,534 --> 00:15:38,667
YOU'RE JUST STUPID.

285
00:15:38,669 --> 00:15:40,201
SO EITHER SIT DOWN,
AND SHUT UP,

286
00:15:40,203 --> 00:15:45,240
AND LET ME RUN THIS ARMY,
OR GET OFF MY TEAM.

287
00:15:45,242 --> 00:15:48,143
SO, WHICH IS IT?

288
00:15:53,549 --> 00:15:54,683
OKAY.

289
00:15:54,685 --> 00:15:57,352
OKAY, WHAT?

290
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:07,062
OKAY.
I'M IN CHARGE.

291
00:16:07,064 --> 00:16:09,698
YOU CAN'T!
IT'S NOT FAIR!

292
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,334
GO HOME.
YOU'RE DEAD.

293
00:16:12,336 --> 00:16:17,172
THEN FUCK YOU.
AND FUCK ALL YOU

294
00:16:22,678 --> 00:16:25,714
WHO'S WITH ME?

295
00:16:26,415 --> 00:16:30,385
SIKORSKI?
FROST?

296
00:16:31,654 --> 00:16:34,622
YEAH.
THAT WAS COOL.

297
00:16:34,624 --> 00:16:37,258
OKAY.
YEAH.

298
00:16:39,161 --> 00:16:40,228
YOU?

299
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:43,431
YOU HAVE ANY CONTRIBUTION
TO MAKE TO THIS TEAM?

300
00:16:43,433 --> 00:16:45,033
I HAVE TECHNIQUES.

301
00:16:45,035 --> 00:16:46,334
GREAT.
WHATEVER.

302
00:16:46,336 --> 00:16:50,105
SIKORSKI,
TIE THE CHINK TO A TREE.

303
00:16:52,475 --> 00:16:56,077
Joker:
WHAT'S YOUR NAME AGAIN?

304
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,579
THIS YOUR FIRST WAR?

305
00:16:57,581 --> 00:16:58,613
YEAH.

306
00:16:58,615 --> 00:17:00,715
WHY'D YOU COME OUT?

307
00:17:00,717 --> 00:17:02,751
UM...
FOR FUN, I GUESS.

308
00:17:02,753 --> 00:17:05,253
I DON'T REALLY HAVE
A LOT OF FRIENDS.

309
00:17:05,255 --> 00:17:06,488
AND YOU'RE A PRIEST?

310
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,189
THAT WHY YOU DON'T
HAVE MANY FRIENDS?

311
00:17:08,191 --> 00:17:13,061
ACTUALLY,
I'M AN ALTAR BOY.

312
00:17:13,063 --> 00:17:14,496
OH.

313
00:17:14,498 --> 00:17:16,231
EVER BEEN BUGGERED?

314
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:19,834
NO, IT'S AN
ANGLICAN CHURCH.

315
00:17:21,537 --> 00:17:22,337
SO...

316
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:24,472
WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH GOD, ALTAR BOY?

317
00:17:24,474 --> 00:17:25,573
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

318
00:17:25,575 --> 00:17:28,410
WHAT'S SO GREAT
ABOUT GOD?

319
00:17:28,412 --> 00:17:29,778
GOD IS LOVE.

320
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,247
WHAT THE HELL
DOES THAT MEAN?

321
00:17:32,249 --> 00:17:34,282
GOD LOVES YOU
ALL THE TIME,

322
00:17:34,284 --> 00:17:35,717
NO MATTER WHAT.
SO?

323
00:17:35,719 --> 00:17:38,186
SO, NO MATTER WHAT
YOU DO WRONG,

324
00:17:38,188 --> 00:17:41,089
ALL YOU HAVE
TO DO IS ASK HIM

325
00:17:41,091 --> 00:17:43,124
AND HE WILL.
EVERY TIME.

326
00:17:43,126 --> 00:17:47,162
( scoffs )
GOD IS SO GAY.

327
00:17:48,097 --> 00:17:52,333
IF GOD TOLD YOU TO
ENGAGE IN COPROPHAGIA,

328
00:17:52,335 --> 00:17:54,869
WHAT'S COPROPHA...
COPROPHAGIA.

329
00:17:54,871 --> 00:17:57,472
IT MEANS EATING SHIT.
INSANE PEOPLE DO IT,

330
00:17:57,474 --> 00:17:59,274
AND I GUESS DOGS
SOMETIMES.

331
00:17:59,276 --> 00:18:01,409
DO YOU EVEN HAVE
THE INTERNET?

332
00:18:01,411 --> 00:18:03,111
YEAH, BUT I DON'T...

333
00:18:03,113 --> 00:18:05,280
THERE'S SOME DOG SHIT
RIGHT THERE.

334
00:18:05,282 --> 00:18:08,883
NOW, WHAT IF GOD SAID
THAT YOU HAVE TO ENGAGE

335
00:18:08,885 --> 00:18:11,786
OR GET KICKED OUT
OF THE CHURCH FOREVER?

336
00:18:11,788 --> 00:18:13,822
NO, HE WOULD NEVER
DO THAT.

337
00:18:13,824 --> 00:18:15,423
OKAY, WHAT IF HE
PUNISHED YOU?

338
00:18:15,425 --> 00:18:18,526
YOU MADE A MISTAKE,
AND GOD SAYS "OKAY,

339
00:18:18,528 --> 00:18:26,167
BUT IT'S ALL GOOD IF
YOU JUST ENGAGE IN SOME

340
00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:30,738
NO, HE WOULD NEVER.
HE WOULD JUST FORGIVE ME.

341
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,540
( scoffs )
OKAY.

342
00:18:32,542 --> 00:18:36,277
WOULD YOU DO IT
IF I SAID I'D

343
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:37,579
YEAH.
THAT'S RIGHT.

344
00:18:37,581 --> 00:18:41,683
YOU COULD COME OVER,
PLAY VIDEO GAMES,

345
00:18:41,685 --> 00:18:42,784
BEST FRIENDS.

346
00:18:42,786 --> 00:18:44,853
YOU'RE LYING.
I'M DEAD SERIOUS.

347
00:18:44,855 --> 00:18:49,724
IF YOU ENGAGE
IN COPROPHAGIA, I WILL

348
00:18:49,726 --> 00:18:52,494
NO WAY.

349
00:18:53,629 --> 00:18:57,198
AND I'LL GIVE YOU $50.
YEAH, RIGHT.

350
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,468
YOU DON'T EVEN
HAVE $50.

351
00:19:03,172 --> 00:19:07,509
$50...
AND MY FRIENDSHIP.

352
00:19:07,511 --> 00:19:11,446
IT'S YOUR CHOICE.
FRIENDSHIP...

353
00:19:11,448 --> 00:19:12,680
OR FRESH BREATH.

354
00:19:12,682 --> 00:19:16,684
YOU CAME HERE
TO MAKE FRIENDS,

355
00:19:25,861 --> 00:19:29,697
P.K. WANTS TO SEE YOU.

356
00:19:30,499 --> 00:19:34,636
THAT'S A STANDING
OFFER, ALTAR BOY.

357
00:19:34,638 --> 00:19:37,972
THINK IT OVER.

358
00:20:07,803 --> 00:20:10,605
( sighs )

359
00:20:16,378 --> 00:20:18,680
YOU'RE GONNA BE SO SORRY
YOU EVER MET P.K.

360
00:20:18,682 --> 00:20:22,650
YOU'RE GONNA BE SCREAMING,
BEGGING ME TO STOP.

361
00:20:22,652 --> 00:20:25,520
IT'S GONNA BE THE MOST PAIN
YOU'VE EVER FELT.

362
00:20:25,522 --> 00:20:28,556
YOU WON'T EVEN
BE ABLE TO BREATHE.

363
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:30,024
Jess:
SKINNER!

364
00:20:30,026 --> 00:20:33,895
YOU WANNA BE LEADER,
GET OVER HERE AND LEAD.

365
00:20:43,372 --> 00:20:45,406
OKAY, UH...

366
00:20:45,408 --> 00:20:46,874
DO YOU EVEN HAVE
A STRATEGY?

367
00:20:46,876 --> 00:20:48,009
QUINN--
SCREW QUINN!

368
00:20:48,011 --> 00:20:50,912
P.K.'S GONNA TRY AND
SAVE HIS BEST FRIEND

369
00:20:50,914 --> 00:20:53,381
AND WHEN HE DOES,
SHOOT HIM.

370
00:20:53,383 --> 00:20:54,949
BUT DO NOT KILL HIM.

371
00:20:54,951 --> 00:20:57,852
CAPTURE HIM
AND BRING HIM TO ME.

372
00:20:57,854 --> 00:20:58,720
AND THEN WHAT?

373
00:20:58,722 --> 00:21:00,755
THAT'S ALL YOU NEED
TO KNOW FOR NOW.

374
00:21:00,757 --> 00:21:03,524
THAT'S NOT A STRATEGY.
WHAT IF P.K. DOESN'T COME?

375
00:21:03,526 --> 00:21:05,793
WHAT IF HE DOES
SOMETHING THAT

376
00:21:05,795 --> 00:21:08,463
HE WON'T.
OKAY, FINE.

377
00:21:08,465 --> 00:21:10,298
THEN WHERE ARE WE
GOING TO POSITION

378
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,867
IN A PERIMETER?
WHERE IS HE GOING

379
00:21:12,869 --> 00:21:16,671
THERE'S ONLY THREE OF US.
WE CAN'T DEFEND ALL SIDES.

380
00:21:16,673 --> 00:21:18,806
WHAT ABOUT CAPTURING
HIS FLAG?

381
00:21:18,808 --> 00:21:20,008
WE CAN'T BE ON DEFENSE--

382
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,310
IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT,
THEN FUCK OFF!

383
00:21:22,312 --> 00:21:24,746
GO FIGHT YOUR OWN WAR!

384
00:21:28,784 --> 00:21:30,685
OKAY.
SIKORSKI...

385
00:21:30,687 --> 00:21:33,821
YOU AND JESS SECURE
THE PERIMETER AND WAIT

386
00:21:33,823 --> 00:21:37,925
AND WHEN YOU SEE THEM,
YOU KNOW, SHOOT 'EM.

387
00:21:37,927 --> 00:21:39,394
CAN'T I GO WITH FROST?

388
00:21:39,396 --> 00:21:40,728
OKAY, FINE,
GO WITH FROST.

389
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:43,097
NO, NO WAIT.
I NEED FROST

390
00:21:43,099 --> 00:21:44,465
AW, MAN...
AND JESS,

391
00:21:44,467 --> 00:21:48,469
YOU WALK AROUND THE BASE
AND WATCH FOR THE ATTACK.

392
00:21:48,471 --> 00:21:50,605
NO.
WHAT?

393
00:21:50,607 --> 00:21:52,040
I CAN'T DO THAT.
YOU ALREADY TOLD ME

394
00:21:52,042 --> 00:21:53,574
TO SECURE THE PERIMETER
WITH SIKORSKI.

395
00:21:53,576 --> 00:21:55,743
WHY CAN'T ME AND SIKORSKI
WALK AROUND THE BASE

396
00:21:55,745 --> 00:21:57,045
AND THEN SHE
CAN GO SCOUTING?

397
00:21:57,047 --> 00:21:59,714
BUT THEN THERE'S NOBODY
SECURING THE PERIMETER.

398
00:21:59,716 --> 00:22:00,982
CAN I BE A GRENADE
CARRIER?

399
00:22:00,984 --> 00:22:02,684
WHY DON'T I WALK AROUND
THE BASE,

400
00:22:02,686 --> 00:22:05,019
SIKORSKI SCOUTS,
AND FROST SECURES

401
00:22:05,021 --> 00:22:07,555
I'M NOT SURE I CAN
SECURE THE PERIMETER

402
00:22:07,557 --> 00:22:08,790
LISTEN!
SIKORSKI AND FROST,

403
00:22:08,792 --> 00:22:12,860
SECURE THE PERIMETER.
JESS, TAKE THE GRENADES

404
00:22:12,862 --> 00:22:13,828
FUCK!

405
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,930
NOW GO!
IF YOU DON'T

406
00:22:15,932 --> 00:22:17,632
AFTER HALF AN HOUR,
COME BACK.

407
00:22:17,634 --> 00:22:20,468
Kwon: WAIT!
DON'T GO!

408
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,870
HE'S GONNA HURT ME!

409
00:22:22,872 --> 00:22:23,905
ARE YOU?

410
00:22:23,907 --> 00:22:26,107
NO, HE'S JUST TRYING
TO MESS UP OUR TEAM.

411
00:22:26,109 --> 00:22:29,544
WELL, YOU CERTAINLY
DON'T NEED ANY HELP

412
00:22:29,546 --> 00:22:30,378
EXACTLY.

413
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,980
PLEASE, DON'T
LEAVE ME ALONE

414
00:22:32,982 --> 00:22:35,717
LOOK,
I WAS JUST TRYING

415
00:22:35,719 --> 00:22:39,587
LISTEN, JESS,
YOU KNOW FROST

416
00:22:39,589 --> 00:22:41,756
HE'S TOTALLY
IN LOVE WITH YOU.

417
00:22:41,758 --> 00:22:44,125
SO?
SO STAY AWAY FROM HIM.

418
00:22:44,127 --> 00:22:47,395
HE'S AN IDIOT,
AND I NEED EVERYONE

419
00:22:47,397 --> 00:22:50,998
YOU CAN SEDUCE
ENEMY SOLDIERS,

420
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,800
EXCUSE ME?
YOU'RE A GIRL.

421
00:22:52,802 --> 00:22:55,670
YOU HAVE SECRET POWERS
OVER THEM.

422
00:22:55,672 --> 00:22:57,405
JUST BLOW THEM A KISS.

423
00:22:57,407 --> 00:23:00,141
AND THEN BLOW THEM AWAY.

424
00:23:17,893 --> 00:23:20,628
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

425
00:23:57,866 --> 00:24:00,968
IMAGINE A GUY...
QUIET!

426
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:02,770
( whispers )
IMAGINE A GUY

427
00:24:02,772 --> 00:24:05,206
HE WORKS FOR EVERY
VIDEO GAME COMPANY

428
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:09,677
HE SAYS YOU CAN HAVE
EVERY CONSOLE FOR THE REST

429
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,713
AND YOU'D GET IT SIX MONTHS
BEFORE EVERYONE ELSE.

430
00:24:12,715 --> 00:24:15,750
SO BASICALLY,
YOU'D BE THE MOST

431
00:24:15,752 --> 00:24:17,618
IN THE WORLD
FOR THOSE SIX MONTHS.

432
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,954
PLUS--
UNLIMITED NEW GAMES.

433
00:24:19,956 --> 00:24:23,524
BUT HE GETS TO CUT OFF
YOUR DICK.

434
00:24:23,526 --> 00:24:26,861
OR YOU CAN KEEP YOUR DICK,
BUT YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED

435
00:24:26,863 --> 00:24:30,665
TO USE ANY COMPUTER
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

436
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:32,834
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

437
00:24:32,836 --> 00:24:36,704
WHY IS THIS GAME
CONSORTIUM SO INTERESTED

438
00:24:36,706 --> 00:24:38,573
JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION.

439
00:24:38,575 --> 00:24:39,207
OKAY.

440
00:24:39,209 --> 00:24:42,810
FIRST, I'D FIND OUT
WHO'S NEXT ON THE LIST

441
00:24:42,812 --> 00:24:48,583
THEN I'D CONTACT
THAT PERSON AND TELL THEM

442
00:24:48,585 --> 00:24:51,719
TO SHARE THE CONSOLE
WITH ME EXCLUSIVELY

443
00:24:51,721 --> 00:24:56,090
THEY'LL AGREE,
BECAUSE IF I SAY YES,

444
00:24:56,092 --> 00:24:57,859
NO, YOU JUST HAVE
TO PICK ONE.

445
00:24:57,861 --> 00:25:01,229
WHY SHOULD I
IF I CAN FIGURE OUT

446
00:25:01,231 --> 00:25:03,931
FORGET IT.
ALTAR BOY,

447
00:25:03,933 --> 00:25:05,700
NO COMPUTERS.

448
00:25:05,702 --> 00:25:09,637
YEAH, ME TOO.

449
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:44,138
LOOK!

450
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,574
COME ON.

451
00:25:46,576 --> 00:25:47,608
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

452
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:50,578
IF I SHAVE THIS DOWN,
I COULD TURN IT INTO

453
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,846
OH!
A BAZOOKA!

454
00:25:51,848 --> 00:25:54,248
IT'D BE LIKE...
( makes explosion

455
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,216
BE QUIET!

456
00:25:55,218 --> 00:25:57,852
FOLLOW ME.
THE GENERAL

457
00:25:57,854 --> 00:25:59,954
ARTILLERY!
OH, SHOCK.

458
00:25:59,956 --> 00:26:02,223
OR LIKE A STAFF,
IF I SHAVED IT DOWN

459
00:26:02,225 --> 00:26:03,891
( whispers )
YOU'RE BEING TOO LOUD!

460
00:26:03,893 --> 00:26:05,226
I'VE GOT BIG PLANS
FOR THIS STICK.

461
00:26:05,228 --> 00:26:09,297
KEEP THE STICK.
I DON'T CARE.

462
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:13,367
COULD TURN IT INTO
A TRIGGER FOR A BOMB

463
00:26:13,369 --> 00:26:14,635
MAYBE A BOOBY TRAP.

464
00:26:14,637 --> 00:26:18,072
I'M IN LOVE WITH THIS STICK.
DO YOU LIKE IT?

465
00:26:18,074 --> 00:26:19,840
SHH!

466
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:24,679
I'M GLAD YOU PICKED ME
FOR YOUR TEAM.

467
00:26:24,681 --> 00:26:29,951
I'M GLAD YOU PICKED ME
FOR YOUR TEAM...

468
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,722
I'M GLAD YOU PICKED ME
FOR YOUR TEAM.

469
00:26:34,724 --> 00:26:36,324
SURE.
NO PROBLEM.

470
00:26:36,326 --> 00:26:38,292
IT'S WORKING OUT BETTER
THAN I THOUGHT.

471
00:26:38,294 --> 00:26:43,197
I MEAN, I WAS KIND
OF HOPING YOU'D PICK ME.

472
00:26:43,199 --> 00:26:45,132
YOU WERE?

473
00:26:45,134 --> 00:26:46,300
YEAH.

474
00:26:46,302 --> 00:26:47,902
WELL, I'M GLAD I DID.

475
00:26:47,904 --> 00:26:49,804
LIKE I SAID,
YOU'RE REALLY SMART.

476
00:26:49,806 --> 00:26:52,306
AND CUTE, TOO.
THANKS.

477
00:26:52,308 --> 00:26:56,110
MAYBE I COULD EVEN
COME WITH YOU GUYS

478
00:26:56,112 --> 00:26:58,713
OH, THAT'D BE AWESOME.
YOU SHOULD.

479
00:26:58,715 --> 00:27:03,217
BUT THERE'S STILL ONE THING
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

480
00:27:03,219 --> 00:27:04,318
WHAT'S THAT?

481
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,954
WHY DID YOU STAY AFTER
SKINNER KILLED ME?

482
00:27:06,956 --> 00:27:08,856
WHY DON'T YOU GO HOME?

483
00:27:08,858 --> 00:27:11,692
YOU DON'T KNOW?
NO.

484
00:27:11,694 --> 00:27:13,828
YOU CAN'T GUESS?

485
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:16,063
I THINK YOU'RE A LITTLE
TOO SMART FOR ME.

486
00:27:16,065 --> 00:27:18,666
WELL, YOU'LL FIND OUT.
IT'LL BE A SURPRISE.

487
00:27:18,668 --> 00:27:21,802
BUT WHAT IF SOMETHING
HAPPENS TO YOU?

488
00:27:21,804 --> 00:27:24,205
OH, THAT'S SO SWEET--
( twig snaps )

489
00:27:24,207 --> 00:27:26,407
HEY.
DON'T MOVE!

490
00:27:26,409 --> 00:27:28,876
WHO ARE YOU?
PUT THAT DOWN!

491
00:27:28,878 --> 00:27:30,845
I'M LOOKING
FOR PAUL KWON.

492
00:27:30,847 --> 00:27:32,046
WHY?
HE'S MY BROTHER.

493
00:27:32,048 --> 00:27:35,316
OUR MOM GOT HURT,
AND SHE'S IN THE HOSPITAL,

494
00:27:35,318 --> 00:27:38,285
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE HE IS?

495
00:27:38,287 --> 00:27:40,054
DO YOU KNOW A GUY
NAMED P.K. SULLIVAN?

496
00:27:40,056 --> 00:27:43,090
WHO?
LOOK, THIS IS A

497
00:27:43,092 --> 00:27:45,860
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
HE IS OR NOT?

498
00:27:46,461 --> 00:27:49,730
I KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU AND P.K. HATE ME.

499
00:27:49,732 --> 00:27:53,034
I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU.

500
00:27:54,069 --> 00:27:56,170
P.K. KNOWS ME.

501
00:28:03,178 --> 00:28:06,047
( grunts )
OH... OW...

502
00:28:06,815 --> 00:28:10,184
I READ BOOKS, KWON.
I'M NOT STUPID.

503
00:28:10,186 --> 00:28:14,955
I NE-- NEVER...
SAID-- SAID--

504
00:28:14,957 --> 00:28:16,190
OOF!

505
00:28:16,192 --> 00:28:17,224
THIS IS CALLED "PRESSING".

506
00:28:17,226 --> 00:28:22,963
IT'S HOW THEY USED
TO KILL PEOPLE BEFORE

507
00:28:22,965 --> 00:28:24,799
( coughs )

508
00:28:24,801 --> 00:28:28,369
I READ IT IN A BOOK.

509
00:28:29,404 --> 00:28:32,773
YOU KNOW THAT GIRL JESS?
DON'T YOU THINK SHE'S COOL?

510
00:28:32,775 --> 00:28:33,941
I DON'T KNOW WHY, JUST--

511
00:28:33,943 --> 00:28:35,342
JUST THE WAY SHE
LOOKS AT YOU.

512
00:28:35,344 --> 00:28:37,378
I KNOW THAT SOUNDS DUMB.
THIS ONE TIME,

513
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,014
I WAS WALKING DOWN
THE HALL AND SHE WAS

514
00:28:40,016 --> 00:28:44,118
I SAID HI TO HER,
AND SHE THREW THESE DRY

515
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,453
AND HER FRIENDS LAUGHED.

516
00:28:45,455 --> 00:28:47,221
BUT I KEPT THE LITTLE
NOODLE THAT HIT ME.

517
00:28:47,223 --> 00:28:49,156
I GOT IT IN MY SHOEBOX
BACK HOME-- YOU KNOW,

518
00:28:49,158 --> 00:28:51,525
THE ONE I KEEP
MY HOCKEY CARDS IN?

519
00:28:51,527 --> 00:28:54,061
JEEZ, SHE'S SO PRETTY.

520
00:28:54,063 --> 00:28:56,831
IT'S HARD NOT TO THINK
ABOUT HER SOMETIMES.

521
00:28:56,833 --> 00:28:57,998
YOU EVER FEEL LIKE THAT?

522
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
LIKE YOU TRY TO THINK
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE,

523
00:29:00,002 --> 00:29:03,337
LIKE A TV SHOW,
OR A VIDEO GAME, OR...

524
00:29:03,339 --> 00:29:06,040
HEY.
YEAH?

525
00:29:06,042 --> 00:29:07,908
SHUT UP.

526
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,443
OH.
HEH.

527
00:29:09,445 --> 00:29:10,277
SURE, SIKORSKI.

528
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:13,514
I'LL SHUT UP-- I KNOW.
I'VE GOT A BIG MOUTH.

529
00:29:13,516 --> 00:29:16,016
AND I'M JUST SO EXCITED!

530
00:29:16,018 --> 00:29:18,552
EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON.

531
00:29:18,554 --> 00:29:20,187
WE PROBABLY SHOULD
BE QUIET, THOUGH.

532
00:29:20,189 --> 00:29:24,125
YOU KNOW, IN CASE P.K.'S
TRYING TO SNEAK UP ON US

533
00:29:24,127 --> 00:29:26,193
MY MA ALWAYS SAYS
THE SAME THING.

534
00:29:26,195 --> 00:29:29,096
"BE QUIET, ROY!"
SHE ALWAYS SAYS

535
00:29:29,098 --> 00:29:31,899
AND THERE ARE FOLLOWERS,
AND THE FOLLOWERS

536
00:29:31,901 --> 00:29:33,501
AND LET THE LEADERS
DO ALL OF THE TALKING,

537
00:29:33,503 --> 00:29:34,969
WHICH I THINK
IS TOTALLY TRUE.

538
00:29:34,971 --> 00:29:36,303
YOU'RE A LEADER
AND I'M A FOLLOWER.

539
00:29:36,305 --> 00:29:38,072
THAT'S WHY WE'RE
SUCH GOOD FRIENDS.

540
00:29:38,074 --> 00:29:39,507
YUP, WE'RE A TEAM,
ALL RIGHT.

541
00:29:39,509 --> 00:29:43,511
LIKE THE ALLIGATOR
AND THE BIRD THAT

542
00:29:43,513 --> 00:29:46,313
YOU'RE THE ALLIGATOR,
RIGHT?

543
00:29:46,315 --> 00:29:49,016
WHAT IS IT?
IT'S A KID.

544
00:29:49,018 --> 00:29:52,386
A...
BIG ASIAN KID.

545
00:29:52,388 --> 00:29:53,521
WHAT DOES HE WANT?

546
00:29:53,523 --> 00:29:55,189
HE'S KWON'S
BROTHER.

547
00:29:55,191 --> 00:29:57,424
THERE'S BEEN AN ACCIDENT.

548
00:30:08,403 --> 00:30:10,437
( hyperventilates )

549
00:30:13,575 --> 00:30:16,043
Jess:
SKINNER!

550
00:30:23,218 --> 00:30:26,287
I SAID HALF
AN HOUR!

551
00:30:29,424 --> 00:30:32,993
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE?

552
00:30:32,995 --> 00:30:34,595
UNTIE HIM!

553
00:30:39,167 --> 00:30:42,970
WHAT KIND OF A GAME
IS THIS?

554
00:30:45,974 --> 00:30:47,575
GET ROCKS.
GO.

555
00:30:47,577 --> 00:30:49,176
GET ROCKS.
GO.

556
00:30:49,178 --> 00:30:52,112
PAUL...
IT'S MOM.

557
00:30:52,114 --> 00:30:53,080
SHE BROKE HER ARM.

558
00:30:53,082 --> 00:30:57,017
DAD'S GOT HER DOWN AT
ST. JOHN'S HOSPITAL AND

559
00:30:57,019 --> 00:31:00,588
HE GAVE ME MONEY
FOR A CAB.

560
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:02,089
YOU OKAY?

561
00:31:02,091 --> 00:31:04,225
LET'S GO.
WAIT!

562
00:31:04,227 --> 00:31:06,227
I DIDN'T KNOW KWON
HAD A BROTHER.

563
00:31:06,229 --> 00:31:07,995
WELL, HE DOES, OKAY?
LET'S JUST GO.

564
00:31:07,997 --> 00:31:09,496
SHOW ME THE MONEY,
THEN.

565
00:31:09,498 --> 00:31:11,098
WHAT?
FOR THE CAB.

566
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,334
YOU THINK I'M MAKING
THIS UP, DICKFACE?

567
00:31:13,336 --> 00:31:16,570
JUST SHOW ME THE MONEY,
AND YOU CAN GO.

568
00:31:18,006 --> 00:31:19,406
SCREW YOU!

569
00:31:19,408 --> 00:31:22,910
WHAT'S KWON'S
BIRTHDAY?

570
00:31:22,912 --> 00:31:23,577
JESUS CHRIST!

571
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:25,012
YOU'RE PARANOID,
SKINNER!

572
00:31:25,014 --> 00:31:27,615
NOT EVERYTHING HAS
TO DO WITH P.K.!

573
00:31:27,617 --> 00:31:29,617
HEY!

574
00:31:29,619 --> 00:31:32,519
YOU'RE NOT LEAVING.

575
00:31:32,521 --> 00:31:33,454
RIGHT.

576
00:31:33,456 --> 00:31:35,222
( grunting )

577
00:31:35,224 --> 00:31:36,657
OW!
OW!

578
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:39,526
YOU'RE FUCKING DEAD!

579
00:31:44,065 --> 00:31:46,133
AH!

580
00:31:49,004 --> 00:31:53,040
IS THAT THE BEST
YOU CAN DO, P.K.?

581
00:31:53,042 --> 00:31:55,709
FOLLOW HIM.
FOLLOW HIM!

582
00:31:55,711 --> 00:31:58,612
HE'LL LEAD YOU
RIGHT TO P.K.

583
00:31:58,614 --> 00:32:02,650
GO!
GO!

584
00:32:03,385 --> 00:32:08,389
IS THAT THE BEST
YOU CAN DO?

585
00:32:27,309 --> 00:32:29,677
FROST, SMOKES.

586
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:32,446
SHIT!
I THOUGHT I

587
00:32:32,448 --> 00:32:34,114
HE'S GONNA SEE YOU.

588
00:32:34,116 --> 00:32:35,649
HE'S GONNA
SEE YOU, TOO.

589
00:32:35,651 --> 00:32:38,018
NO, HE'S NOT.
I'M GOING HOME.

590
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,386
WHAT?
YOU'RE GOING HOME?

591
00:32:39,388 --> 00:32:41,655
YEAH.
WHY?

592
00:32:41,657 --> 00:32:43,557
I WANT SOME JUICE.

593
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:46,026
PLUS, I NEED A BREAK
FROM SKINNER.

594
00:32:46,028 --> 00:32:48,095
SO YOU'RE QUITTING,
JUST LIKE THAT?

595
00:32:48,097 --> 00:32:50,531
NO,
I'M NOT QUITTING.

596
00:32:50,533 --> 00:32:53,167
JUST RIGHT NOW,
I WANT SOME JUICE.

597
00:32:53,169 --> 00:32:54,501
OH.

598
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:58,739
OKAY.
DO YOU GUYS

599
00:32:58,741 --> 00:33:03,777
NO!
YOU CAN'T STOP

600
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:06,413
WATCH ME.

601
00:33:07,782 --> 00:33:10,017
SORRY ABOUT THAT,
SIKORSKI.

602
00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:12,353
WHAT WAS I THINKING?
SHE ALMOST SEDUCED ME

603
00:33:12,355 --> 00:33:14,588
SHE MUST HAVE BEEN
WEARING SOME SORT

604
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:17,524
OR SOMETHING,
'CAUSE WE'RE BEST FRIENDS,

605
00:33:17,526 --> 00:33:19,460
AND THAT'S NUMBER ONE
FOR ME.

606
00:33:19,462 --> 00:33:21,628
I'D NEVER...
SHUT UP.

607
00:33:43,685 --> 00:33:47,688
( helicopter sounds,
radio chatters )

608
00:35:00,361 --> 00:35:02,129
HEY!

609
00:35:07,535 --> 00:35:08,635
WHERE'S PAUL?

610
00:35:08,637 --> 00:35:10,604
OH, I'M FINE,
THANKS.

611
00:35:10,606 --> 00:35:13,841
NEXT TIME, DON'T CALL ME
FOR ANY FAVORS, OKAY?

612
00:35:13,843 --> 00:35:15,375
WHERE'S PAUL?

613
00:35:15,377 --> 00:35:17,277
YOUR LITTLE PSYCHO
FRIEND HAS HIM TIED UP

614
00:35:17,279 --> 00:35:18,812
TO A TREE
BACK IN THOSE WOODS.

615
00:35:18,814 --> 00:35:21,415
HE'S STILL ALIVE?
OF COURSE HE'S ALIVE.

616
00:35:21,417 --> 00:35:22,850
THEY'RE NOT GONNA
KILL HIM.

617
00:35:22,852 --> 00:35:24,751
NO, BUT DID HE HAVE
RED PAINT ALL OVER HIM?

618
00:35:24,753 --> 00:35:27,321
NO.
WHAT'S UP

619
00:35:27,323 --> 00:35:30,157
THAT SPAZ STARTED
THROWING ROCKS AT ME.

620
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:32,426
WAIT,
WERE YOU FOLLOWED?

621
00:35:32,428 --> 00:35:33,827
NO.
I DON'T KNOW.

622
00:35:33,829 --> 00:35:37,865
CAN YOU PUT
THE GUNS DOWN?

623
00:35:37,867 --> 00:35:40,267
SO WHAT WAS
SKINNER DOING?

624
00:35:40,269 --> 00:35:41,735
WHO?
THE SPAZ.

625
00:35:41,737 --> 00:35:44,304
HE WAS ASKING ME
QUESTIONS ABOUT PAUL.

626
00:35:44,306 --> 00:35:45,506
WHAT KIND
OF QUESTIONS?

627
00:35:45,508 --> 00:35:48,475
LIKE, WAS I HIS
REAL BROTHER.

628
00:35:48,477 --> 00:35:51,512
I WENT IN THERE,
THE SPAZ LOST HIS MIND

629
00:35:51,514 --> 00:35:53,447
AND STARTED THROWING
ROCKS AT ME.

630
00:35:53,449 --> 00:35:55,816
ALMOST BROKE MY NOSE.

631
00:35:55,818 --> 00:35:57,851
OKAY.
ANYTHING ELSE?

632
00:35:57,853 --> 00:35:59,586
WHEN I LEFT,
THE LOSER YELLED,

633
00:35:59,588 --> 00:36:02,556
"IS THAT THE BEST
YOU CAN DO, P.K.?"

634
00:36:02,558 --> 00:36:04,791
SKINNER YELLED THAT?
YUP.

635
00:36:04,793 --> 00:36:08,896
AND THERE WASN'T A TALLER
KID WITH BLONDE HAIR

636
00:36:08,898 --> 00:36:09,930
NOPE.

637
00:36:09,932 --> 00:36:11,865
I KNEW IT.

638
00:36:11,867 --> 00:36:14,434
WHAT?
WHAT IS IT, P.K.?

639
00:36:14,436 --> 00:36:17,838
IT'S HOT OUT HERE.
I GOTTA GO.

640
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:21,375
OKAY.
THANKS.

641
00:36:21,377 --> 00:36:23,377
"THANKS"?
I DON'T THINK SO.

642
00:36:23,379 --> 00:36:25,946
WHERE'S MY THREE BUCKS?

643
00:36:42,297 --> 00:36:45,465
Joker:
WELL, AT LEAST IT WASN'T

644
00:36:45,467 --> 00:36:47,834
NOW WE KNOW WHERE
THEIR BASE IS.

645
00:36:47,836 --> 00:36:49,536
YEAH.

646
00:36:49,538 --> 00:36:50,837
SO, WHERE IS IT?

647
00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:53,607
WHAT?
THEIR BASE.

648
00:36:53,609 --> 00:36:55,676
WHERE'S THEIR BASE?

649
00:36:55,678 --> 00:36:56,910
HOW THE HELL SHOULD I KNOW?

650
00:36:56,912 --> 00:36:59,246
IN THE WOODS.
OVER THERE SOMEWHERE.

651
00:36:59,248 --> 00:37:00,747
YOU'RE JOKING
WITH ME.

652
00:37:00,749 --> 00:37:03,750
COME ON!
WE NEED THIS!

653
00:37:03,752 --> 00:37:04,718
HEY, SEE THIS?

654
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,854
I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU NEED!

655
00:37:07,856 --> 00:37:09,623
CALM DOWN.

656
00:37:10,258 --> 00:37:13,594
THANKS FOR YOUR WORK.
I'LL REMEMBER THIS.

657
00:37:18,666 --> 00:37:20,267
NOW WHAT?

658
00:37:20,269 --> 00:37:21,969
WE GOT NOTHING
OUT OF THAT.

659
00:37:21,971 --> 00:37:26,440
DOES EGYPT 1952
MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?

660
00:37:26,442 --> 00:37:27,808
NO.

661
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,676
CHINA 1911?
OH--

662
00:37:29,678 --> 00:37:34,881
GREECE 1967
IS ACTUALLY THE

663
00:37:34,883 --> 00:37:36,683
WESLEY?

664
00:37:36,685 --> 00:37:37,884
THE OLYMPICS?

665
00:37:37,886 --> 00:37:40,787
( sigh )
IT'S A COUP.

666
00:37:40,789 --> 00:37:43,023
SKINNER KILLED QUINN.

667
00:37:43,025 --> 00:37:44,358
THAT'S A TOTAL GUESS.

668
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,394
IF QUINN WAS STILL
IN CHARGE, PAUL

669
00:37:47,396 --> 00:37:48,895
IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

670
00:37:48,897 --> 00:37:50,831
QUINN WOULD NEVER
TAKE A PRISONER.

671
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:51,965
HE KNOWS IT MAKES
NO SENSE.

672
00:37:51,967 --> 00:37:57,638
AND HE'D NEVER LET SKINNER
RUN AROUND SCREAMING HIS

673
00:38:13,888 --> 00:38:17,524
( firing )

674
00:38:21,329 --> 00:38:22,929
( Paul coughs )

675
00:38:26,734 --> 00:38:28,635
PLEASE...

676
00:38:28,637 --> 00:38:32,539
PLEASE,
LET ME GO.

677
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:37,544
NO.

678
00:38:37,879 --> 00:38:40,947
YOU FUCKED UP MY LIFE,
SO YOU'RE GOING TO PAY

679
00:38:40,949 --> 00:38:44,785
I-- I'VE--
NEVER EVEN...

680
00:38:44,787 --> 00:38:47,087
THEN YOU AND P.K. DID.

681
00:38:47,089 --> 00:38:48,889
WHAT DID WE DO?

682
00:38:48,891 --> 00:38:50,991
BEFORE, I WAS NORMAL.

683
00:38:50,993 --> 00:38:54,795
I-- I WASN'T COOL,
BUT I WASN'T A LOSER.

684
00:38:54,797 --> 00:38:57,030
NOW, I AM A LOSER.

685
00:38:57,032 --> 00:39:00,967
I'M A JOKE, AND MY LIFE
IS BASICALLY OVER.

686
00:39:00,969 --> 00:39:02,703
I'M GONNA BE A LOSER
IN HIGH SCHOOL,

687
00:39:02,705 --> 00:39:06,740
A LOSER IN UNIVERSITY,
AND A LOSER FOR THE REST

688
00:39:06,742 --> 00:39:10,010
EVEN THE RETARDS
ARE MORE POPULAR

689
00:39:10,012 --> 00:39:12,012
I MIGHT AS WELL
BE A RETARD.

690
00:39:12,014 --> 00:39:16,683
OR HAVE A BIG SCAR
ON MY FACE.

691
00:39:16,685 --> 00:39:20,754
( coughs )

692
00:39:21,522 --> 00:39:26,727
CAN YOU IMAGINE
HOW TERRIBLE IT WOULD BE

693
00:39:26,729 --> 00:39:29,863
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF YOUR FACE?

694
00:39:31,399 --> 00:39:33,467
OR BLIND.

695
00:39:33,469 --> 00:39:37,771
OR YOUR TONGUE
CUT OUT?

696
00:39:37,773 --> 00:39:40,407
THAT WOULD SUCK, EH?

697
00:39:40,409 --> 00:39:42,876
PLEASE LET ME GO.

698
00:39:42,878 --> 00:39:49,516
I'M-- I'M SORRY
FOR WHATEVER WE DID.

699
00:39:49,518 --> 00:39:50,650
NOT YET.

700
00:39:50,652 --> 00:39:54,921
NOT UNTIL YOU FEEL
THE SAME WAY I DO.

701
00:39:57,892 --> 00:40:01,528
THEN YOU'LL BE SORRY.

702
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:58,618
GOTCHA!
DID NOT!

703
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,986
DID TOO!

704
00:41:44,899 --> 00:41:48,668
HEY, SIKORSKI!
YOU HEAR ME?

705
00:41:50,071 --> 00:41:53,273
HOW ABOUT YOUR
GIRLFRIEND, FROST?

706
00:41:54,876 --> 00:41:57,177
YOU TELL QUINN
I'M COMIN' FOR HIM!

707
00:41:57,179 --> 00:42:01,915
YOU TAKE MY BEST FRIEND
PRISONER, AND YOU'RE ASKING

708
00:42:01,917 --> 00:42:03,316
THAT'S NOT HOW
YOU WIN A WAR!

709
00:42:03,318 --> 00:42:07,254
YEAH?
WELL, THERE'S NO

710
00:42:07,256 --> 00:42:10,257
TELL HIM THAT'S
NOT HIS STYLE!

711
00:42:10,259 --> 00:42:11,625
HE'S BETTER THAN THAT!

712
00:42:11,627 --> 00:42:15,128
WELL,
MAYBE QUINN'S NOT

713
00:42:17,098 --> 00:42:17,964
( groans )

714
00:42:17,966 --> 00:42:21,201
YEAH?
SO, WHO IS?

715
00:42:21,203 --> 00:42:24,838
YOU, FROST?
NO, IT'S QUINN.

716
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,841
REALLY?
CAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE

717
00:42:27,843 --> 00:42:31,311
IS A BIG,
FAT LIAR!

718
00:42:36,717 --> 00:42:39,619
TIME OUT, P.K.!
QUINN HAD TO GO HOME.

719
00:42:39,621 --> 00:42:44,925
WE'LL TELL YOU WHAT
HAPPENED, BUT YOU HAVE

720
00:42:45,593 --> 00:42:49,829
OKAY!
TWO MINUTES.

721
00:42:49,831 --> 00:42:52,933
OKAY, COME ON OUT!

722
00:42:53,601 --> 00:42:58,605
OKAY.
I'M COMING OUT

723
00:43:00,107 --> 00:43:02,075
HA!

724
00:43:08,215 --> 00:43:10,317
( grunts )

725
00:43:14,055 --> 00:43:16,289
( coughs )

726
00:43:17,992 --> 00:43:21,661
OH, MAN, THAT WAS SWEET!
DID YOU SEE?

727
00:43:21,663 --> 00:43:24,097
NICE ONE, FROST!

728
00:43:26,634 --> 00:43:29,836
NO!
( groans )

729
00:43:32,206 --> 00:43:35,108
P.K.!
GIVE ME COVER!

730
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:37,310
( ringing )

731
00:43:51,025 --> 00:43:53,727
( screams )

732
00:43:53,729 --> 00:43:55,128
AAH!

733
00:43:56,297 --> 00:43:58,798
OUT!
GET OUT, GET OUT!

734
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,800
COME ON!
MOVE, NOW!

735
00:44:00,802 --> 00:44:04,104
NINE STEAMBOATS...
GET UP!

736
00:44:04,106 --> 00:44:05,205
FOUR...

737
00:44:05,207 --> 00:44:08,008
FROST!

738
00:44:08,409 --> 00:44:11,878
LET HIM GO,
OR YOU'LL REGRET IT.

739
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,881
BULLSHIT.
TAKE HIM, FROST.

740
00:44:14,883 --> 00:44:17,150
TEN.

741
00:44:18,819 --> 00:44:20,020
LAST CHANCE.

742
00:44:20,022 --> 00:44:22,756
LET HIM GO,
OR HE'S GONNA GET IT.

743
00:44:22,758 --> 00:44:27,427
HE'S BLUFFING.
HE'S GOT NOTHING.

744
00:44:27,429 --> 00:44:30,030
DO SO.
DO NOT.

745
00:44:30,032 --> 00:44:33,166
DO SO.
DO NOT.

746
00:44:33,168 --> 00:44:36,169
DO SO.
DO NOT!

747
00:44:36,171 --> 00:44:39,939
( buzzing )
DO... SO.

748
00:44:41,942 --> 00:44:43,376
RUN!

749
00:44:44,712 --> 00:44:47,781
( all scream )

750
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,175
HE LOVES ME.

751
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,555
HE LOVES ME NOT.

752
00:45:38,933 --> 00:45:41,101
HE LOVES ME.

753
00:45:54,048 --> 00:45:55,315
OOF!
AH...

754
00:45:55,317 --> 00:45:59,419
SO, I HEARD YOU AND
YOUR BUM-BUDDY KICKED

755
00:45:59,421 --> 00:46:01,821
IS THAT TRUE?
NO, I SWEAR.

756
00:46:01,823 --> 00:46:03,323
SKINNER TOLD US TO.

757
00:46:03,325 --> 00:46:05,091
KENNEY TOLD ME
YOU STOMPED ON HIM,

758
00:46:05,093 --> 00:46:07,227
AND HE ASKED ME
TO STOMP BACK,

759
00:46:07,229 --> 00:46:09,262
SO WE'RE GONNA.

760
00:46:10,231 --> 00:46:12,232
READY TO GET YOUR
NOSE BROKEN, BITCH?

761
00:46:12,234 --> 00:46:16,536
THEN YOU GO CRY TO SIKORSKI
AND TELL HIM HE'S NEXT.

762
00:46:16,538 --> 00:46:19,372
NO!
( grunts )

763
00:46:21,442 --> 00:46:25,912
ALTAR BOY, GET IN HERE
AND HELP ME HOLD HIM.

764
00:46:27,915 --> 00:46:29,382
ALTAR BOY, GE...

765
00:46:29,384 --> 00:46:30,517
AAH!

766
00:46:30,519 --> 00:46:33,286
OH!

767
00:46:33,288 --> 00:46:35,622
HA!
AAH!

768
00:46:36,857 --> 00:46:38,191
BAM!
( fires )

769
00:46:38,193 --> 00:46:39,993
BAM!
( fires )

770
00:46:40,394 --> 00:46:42,929
ONE...
SIKORSKI!

771
00:46:42,931 --> 00:46:44,464
I NEED A GRENADE!

772
00:46:44,466 --> 00:46:47,200
ARE YOU THERE?
SIKORSKI!

773
00:46:47,202 --> 00:46:50,003
FIVE...
SIKORSKI!

774
00:46:50,005 --> 00:46:51,504
I NEED GRENADES!

775
00:46:51,506 --> 00:46:53,840
SEVEN...
UGH!

776
00:46:53,842 --> 00:46:57,844
EIGHT...
NINE...

777
00:46:57,846 --> 00:46:59,946
BITCH.

778
00:47:01,182 --> 00:47:04,083
AND YOU!
WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?

779
00:47:04,085 --> 00:47:06,152
I'M SORRY.
I WAS SCARED.

780
00:47:06,154 --> 00:47:08,555
YOU WERE SCARED?
IT WAS TWO AGAINST ONE.

781
00:47:08,557 --> 00:47:11,357
YOU WERE SCARED
HE'D BEAT US <i>BOTH</i> UP?

782
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:14,527
GOD, YOU LITTLE
CHICKEN-SHIT GEEK.

783
00:47:14,529 --> 00:47:16,963
I'M SORRY.

784
00:47:28,442 --> 00:47:30,210
JOKER?

785
00:47:30,212 --> 00:47:32,478
( grunts )

786
00:47:44,124 --> 00:47:47,994
OW!
( coughs )

787
00:47:47,996 --> 00:47:51,097
YOU STILL HERE?

788
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,969
GOOD.

789
00:48:15,923 --> 00:48:18,524
H... HEY.

790
00:48:19,927 --> 00:48:21,094
YOU SAY SOMETHING?

791
00:48:21,096 --> 00:48:25,365
IS THAT STORY
ABOUT YOU AND JENNY...

792
00:48:25,367 --> 00:48:29,369
( coughs )
...AND KAREN TRUE?

793
00:48:31,405 --> 00:48:33,339
NO.

794
00:48:33,341 --> 00:48:34,941
WHAT STORY?

795
00:48:34,943 --> 00:48:40,346
THE ONE WHERE THEY
INVITED YOU OVER

796
00:48:40,348 --> 00:48:42,582
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

797
00:48:42,584 --> 00:48:45,551
THREE DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

798
00:48:45,553 --> 00:48:48,488
WELL, THEY'RE LYING.

799
00:48:49,523 --> 00:48:54,627
I HEARD THAT
AFTER SCHOOL ONE DAY...

800
00:48:54,629 --> 00:48:58,197
KAREN INVITED YOU
OVER TO GO SWIMMING

801
00:48:58,199 --> 00:49:02,101
AT 888 SPENCE STREET.

802
00:49:02,103 --> 00:49:07,173
SPENCE ONLY GOES UP
TO 880, RIGHT?

803
00:49:07,175 --> 00:49:10,443
HOW LONG DID YOU SPEND

804
00:49:10,445 --> 00:49:15,348
EVEN LOOKING FOR 882?

805
00:49:15,350 --> 00:49:16,516
AN HOUR?

806
00:49:16,518 --> 00:49:23,189
DID YOU RING ANY DOORBELLS
TO ASK WHERE...

807
00:49:23,191 --> 00:49:27,694
( coughs )
...888 WAS?

808
00:49:27,696 --> 00:49:35,034
THAT'S HOW YOU MUST
HAVE FOUND OUT, RIGHT?

809
00:49:39,239 --> 00:49:41,007
( coughs )

810
00:49:41,009 --> 00:49:42,775
SOME NEIGHBOR MUST
HAVE TOLD YOU.

811
00:49:42,777 --> 00:49:51,184
THEN THEY WERE LIKE,
"LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY PLAYED

812
00:49:51,186 --> 00:49:53,219
RIGHT?

813
00:49:53,221 --> 00:49:55,421
SHUT UP!

814
00:50:04,198 --> 00:50:07,600
OW!
OWW!

815
00:50:07,602 --> 00:50:09,435
GOD!

816
00:50:12,439 --> 00:50:14,774
DON'T.

817
00:50:19,213 --> 00:50:21,614
AAH!
AH!

818
00:50:38,399 --> 00:50:41,234
FUCK!

819
00:50:56,417 --> 00:50:58,418
SIKORSKI.

820
00:50:59,553 --> 00:51:01,354
SMOKE?

821
00:51:02,723 --> 00:51:04,557
YEAH.

822
00:51:09,163 --> 00:51:10,396
WHERE'S FROST?

823
00:51:10,398 --> 00:51:13,866
THERE WAS A BATTLE.
WITH WASPS.

824
00:51:13,868 --> 00:51:16,469
HE RAN AWAY.

825
00:51:16,471 --> 00:51:18,771
YOU GOT A LIGHT?

826
00:51:18,773 --> 00:51:22,642
NO.
( sighs )

827
00:51:22,644 --> 00:51:24,811
WHERE YOU GOING?

828
00:51:24,813 --> 00:51:26,512
BACK TO BASE.

829
00:51:26,514 --> 00:51:28,648
MIND IF I WALK
WITH YOU?

830
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:30,716
WHATEVER.

831
00:51:37,724 --> 00:51:41,394
I JUST LOVE SMOKING.
DON'T YOU?

832
00:51:41,396 --> 00:51:44,831
I DON'T KNOW.
I GUESS.

833
00:51:48,602 --> 00:51:50,803
CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR?

834
00:51:50,805 --> 00:51:53,139
I DON'T KNOW.

835
00:51:53,141 --> 00:51:56,642
COULD YOU GRAB ME
THAT LEAF UP THERE?

836
00:51:56,644 --> 00:51:58,277
WHY?

837
00:51:58,279 --> 00:52:02,315
I JUST THINK
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

838
00:52:02,317 --> 00:52:04,317
IT'S A LEAF.

839
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:06,385
DON'T YOU EVER
APPRECIATE SOMETHING

840
00:52:06,387 --> 00:52:09,455
JUST BECAUSE
IT'S BEAUTIFUL?

841
00:52:12,426 --> 00:52:14,227
PLEASE?

842
00:52:14,229 --> 00:52:16,596
FOR ME.

843
00:52:16,598 --> 00:52:19,198
( sighs )

844
00:52:33,213 --> 00:52:35,214
THANK YOU.
I LOVE IT.

845
00:52:35,216 --> 00:52:37,884
I'LL KEEP IT
FOREVER.

846
00:52:37,886 --> 00:52:40,953
OKAY...

847
00:52:42,689 --> 00:52:44,257
Jess:
SO, TELL ME ABOUT

848
00:52:44,259 --> 00:52:47,393
WHAT'S YOUR FIRST NAME?
TREVOR.

849
00:52:47,395 --> 00:52:49,795
TREVOR.
THAT'S A NICE NAME.

850
00:52:49,797 --> 00:52:53,799
HEY, TREVOR,
COULD YOU DO ME

851
00:52:53,801 --> 00:52:56,569
I DON'T KNOW.

852
00:52:57,304 --> 00:53:00,973
COULD YOU CARRY
MY CROSSBOW?

853
00:53:09,283 --> 00:53:13,953
AND YOU JUST DIDN'T
GIVE A CRAP THAT WE

854
00:53:13,955 --> 00:53:18,357
I HAD NO CHOICE.
YEAH, RIGHT!

855
00:53:18,359 --> 00:53:21,460
WE WON THE BATTLE.
END OF STORY.

856
00:53:21,462 --> 00:53:24,931
AND NOW WE KNOW FOR SURE
THAT QUINN IS GONE.

857
00:53:24,933 --> 00:53:28,868
IF QUINN'S GONE,
WHY ARE WE STILL

858
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:30,770
BECAUSE A COUP
DOESN'T END A WAR.

859
00:53:30,772 --> 00:53:34,674
BUT WHEN AN INCOMPETENT
GENERAL COMMITS THE COUP,

860
00:53:34,676 --> 00:53:37,376
IT MAKES IT EASIER TO WIN.

861
00:53:37,378 --> 00:53:38,311
SKINNER'S A SPAZ.

862
00:53:38,313 --> 00:53:42,949
WE'LL JUST RUN A CLASSIC
OFFENSIVE ON HIM,

863
00:53:42,951 --> 00:53:44,250
RIGHT.

864
00:53:44,252 --> 00:53:48,821
LOOK, HE CAN'T MOVE
IF HE'S HOLDING PAUL.

865
00:53:48,823 --> 00:53:50,957
HE CAN'T DEFEND
ON ALL SIDES.

866
00:53:50,959 --> 00:53:54,827
MAYBE...
YOU GET TAKEN OUT.

867
00:53:54,829 --> 00:53:59,832
BUT SOMEONE WILL PUNCH
THROUGH AND GET HIS FLAG.

868
00:53:59,834 --> 00:54:00,933
WE WIN.

869
00:54:00,935 --> 00:54:02,835
BUT ONE OF US
GETS KILLED?

870
00:54:02,837 --> 00:54:06,639
THIS IS WAR, MAN,
NOT FUCKING HOPSCOTCH!

871
00:54:06,641 --> 00:54:10,042
YOU WANT TO WIN?
YOU GOTTA HAVE CASUALTIES.

872
00:54:10,044 --> 00:54:13,713
WHATEVER, P.K.,
BUT FROST IS MINE.

873
00:54:13,715 --> 00:54:15,348
IT SEEMS EASY.

874
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:16,449
BECAUSE
IT IS EASY.

875
00:54:16,451 --> 00:54:21,387
AS LONG AS PAUL STAYS
PRISONER, THE BALANCE

876
00:54:21,389 --> 00:54:25,992
THE SECRET TO SUCCESS
LIES IN SIMPLE MANEUVERS.

877
00:54:25,994 --> 00:54:27,860
NAPOLEON SAID THAT.

878
00:54:27,862 --> 00:54:32,698
YEAH?
DIDN'T NAPOLEON

879
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:35,635
NO...

880
00:54:35,637 --> 00:54:39,505
HEY!
P.K.!

881
00:54:39,507 --> 00:54:41,874
P.K.!

882
00:54:42,542 --> 00:54:46,445
OH, MY GOD,
YOU'RE NOT GOING

883
00:54:46,447 --> 00:54:48,347
SKINNER IS MENTAL.

884
00:54:48,349 --> 00:54:51,884
HE KILLED QUINN,
AND THEN HE PUT

885
00:54:51,886 --> 00:54:56,756
AW, MAN, THAT THING
WITH KEVIN WAS AWESOME,

886
00:54:56,758 --> 00:54:58,491
WHEN HE CAME INTO
THE BASE AND STARTED

887
00:54:58,493 --> 00:55:02,094
TELLING EVERYONE WHAT
TO DO, THAT WAS ONE

888
00:55:02,096 --> 00:55:05,765
SKINNER WAS BERSERK, THOUGH.
HE WOULDN'T FALL FOR IT.

889
00:55:05,767 --> 00:55:07,433
AND THEN HE STARTS
TORTURING ME!

890
00:55:07,435 --> 00:55:11,971
BUT THEN I BURNED HIM
AND GOT OUT, SO IT'S OKAY.

891
00:55:12,539 --> 00:55:17,643
HEY, I SAW KEVIN
TAKE A COUPLE ROCKS

892
00:55:17,645 --> 00:55:20,446
IS HE ALL RIGHT?

893
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:26,719
WHAT?

894
00:55:26,721 --> 00:55:30,389
I HAVE SOME BAD NEWS.

895
00:55:30,391 --> 00:55:32,358
WHAT IS IT?

896
00:55:34,928 --> 00:55:37,697
I NEED YOU TO GO BACK.

897
00:55:37,699 --> 00:55:41,133
GO BACK WHERE?

898
00:55:43,537 --> 00:55:44,870
TO SKINNER.

899
00:55:44,872 --> 00:55:49,141
( scoffs )
YEAH, RIGHT.

900
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:52,578
LOOK, I'VE GOT IT ALL
WORKED OUT.

901
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:54,780
IN FACT, NOW THAT
YOU'RE HERE TO TELL US

902
00:55:54,782 --> 00:55:57,683
WHERE HIS BASE IS,
IT'S EVEN MORE PERFECT.

903
00:55:57,685 --> 00:56:00,119
HE WON'T LEAVE AS LONG
AS YOU'RE AT HIS BASE.

904
00:56:00,121 --> 00:56:04,090
I'LL RUN A RING OFFENSIVE
ON HIM AND IT'LL BE OVER.

905
00:56:04,092 --> 00:56:07,827
DID YOU HEAR
WHAT I SAID?

906
00:56:07,829 --> 00:56:11,931
HE TORTURED ME.
HE WAS GONNA CUT ME.

907
00:56:11,933 --> 00:56:16,669
IT'LL ALL BE OVER BEFORE
HE EVEN GETS THE CHANCE

908
00:56:16,671 --> 00:56:19,772
NO.
NO WAY.

909
00:56:19,774 --> 00:56:21,173
COME ON.

910
00:56:21,175 --> 00:56:23,509
IT FITS THE PLAN
PERFECTLY.

911
00:56:23,511 --> 00:56:25,010
MAKE A NEW PLAN!

912
00:56:25,012 --> 00:56:28,848
I CAN'T.
I'M SORRY.

913
00:56:28,850 --> 00:56:32,151
I'M SCARED.

914
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,521
OKAY.

915
00:56:35,523 --> 00:56:36,689
WE'LL START FROM
SCRATCH.

916
00:56:36,691 --> 00:56:39,625
THIS IS BULLSHIT!
IT'S TOO HOT TO BE

917
00:56:39,627 --> 00:56:42,628
WHY DON'T <i>YOU</i>
GO BACK THERE?

918
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:45,598
REALLY WOULD
BE FASTER.

919
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,500
SAY HI TO FROST
FOR ME.

920
00:56:47,502 --> 00:56:51,003
P.K.'S GOT A REALLY
GOOD PLAN.

921
00:56:51,005 --> 00:56:54,707
IT WON'T WORK.

922
00:57:01,114 --> 00:57:04,817
IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.

923
00:57:05,652 --> 00:57:07,653
OH, AWESOME.
THANKS.

924
00:57:07,655 --> 00:57:09,955
CAN YOU BE THERE
IN 15 MINUTES?

925
00:57:09,957 --> 00:57:11,524
YEAH.

926
00:57:11,526 --> 00:57:13,793
UH, WAIT, PAUL.

927
00:57:13,795 --> 00:57:17,663
WHERE'S HIS BASE?

928
00:57:18,932 --> 00:57:22,001
THE DEAD WOODS.

929
00:57:25,505 --> 00:57:27,106
GREAT.
THANKS.

930
00:57:27,108 --> 00:57:29,208
15 MINUTES.

931
00:57:49,062 --> 00:57:51,230
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

932
00:57:51,232 --> 00:57:53,766
WE...

933
00:57:53,768 --> 00:57:55,501
THERE WAS A BATTLE.

934
00:57:55,503 --> 00:57:58,237
WHERE'S PAUL?
HE ESCAPED.

935
00:57:58,239 --> 00:58:01,140
HOW DID HE--
HE ESCAPED, ALL RIGHT?

936
00:58:01,142 --> 00:58:04,810
HE ESCAPED!
WHERE'S FROST?

937
00:58:04,812 --> 00:58:07,279
Frost:
I'M HERE.

938
00:58:09,149 --> 00:58:10,683
WHERE'S PAUL?
HE'S GONE.

939
00:58:10,685 --> 00:58:13,919
HE'S GONE, AND NOW
THERE'S NO HOPE

940
00:58:13,921 --> 00:58:14,720
NONE!

941
00:58:14,722 --> 00:58:18,123
SO, ARE YOU GOING
TO GIVE US ORDERS THERE,

942
00:58:18,125 --> 00:58:22,561
I NEED TO GET PAUL BACK.
GO FIND PAUL.

943
00:58:22,563 --> 00:58:24,230
OKAY.
WE'LL GO TOGETHER.

944
00:58:24,232 --> 00:58:25,664
WHATEVER.

945
00:58:25,666 --> 00:58:27,666
I WANNA GO
WITH FROST.

946
00:58:27,668 --> 00:58:30,002
OKAY, FINE,
GO WITH FROST.

947
00:58:30,004 --> 00:58:33,606
JUST GO, FIND HIM,
AND BRING HIM BACK.

948
00:58:33,608 --> 00:58:35,741
ALIVE!

949
00:58:40,113 --> 00:58:41,847
COME ON.

950
00:58:41,849 --> 00:58:43,315
FROST, COME ON.

951
00:58:43,317 --> 00:58:45,985
DO YOU REMEMBER
THAT ONE TIME

952
00:58:45,987 --> 00:58:49,755
WHEN YOU THREW
CHINESE NOODLES AT ME?

953
00:58:49,757 --> 00:58:51,624
NO.

954
00:58:51,626 --> 00:58:53,325
OH.

955
00:58:53,327 --> 00:58:55,928
WAS YOUR JUICE GOOD?

956
00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:58,197
FROST,
I DON'T LIKE YOU.

957
00:58:58,199 --> 00:59:01,600
I LIKE YOUR FRIEND--
TREVOR.

958
00:59:04,037 --> 00:59:06,906
FROST!
COME ON!

959
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:21,987
BYE, TREVOR.

960
00:59:45,912 --> 00:59:51,684
IF YOU COULD BE THE
MOST FAMOUS, RICHEST,

961
00:59:51,686 --> 00:59:53,018
MOST LOVED PERSON
ON EARTH,

962
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:56,422
BUT HAD TO STICK YOUR
DICK IN A DOG'S MOUTH,

963
00:59:56,424 --> 00:59:59,625
WOULD YOU DO IT?

964
00:59:59,627 --> 01:00:01,794
WHAT KIND OF DOG?

965
01:00:01,796 --> 01:00:03,896
ANY DOG.

966
01:00:03,898 --> 01:00:05,230
A CHIHUAHUA?

967
01:00:05,232 --> 01:00:08,701
IS THAT REALLY HOW
SMALL YOUR DICK IS?

968
01:00:08,703 --> 01:00:10,402
I JUST WANT
A HARMLESS DOG.

969
01:00:10,404 --> 01:00:13,272
OKAY, FINE.
A CHIHUAHUA.

970
01:00:13,274 --> 01:00:15,307
WOULD PEOPLE KNOW
I HAD DONE IT?

971
01:00:15,309 --> 01:00:17,810
YES.
FRONT PAGE OF

972
01:00:17,812 --> 01:00:20,746
"LOCAL BOY STICKS DICK
IN DOG'S MOUTH."

973
01:00:20,748 --> 01:00:23,916
BUT THEN IT WOULD SAY
I WAS RICH AND FAMOUS,

974
01:00:23,918 --> 01:00:25,150
YEAH, NEAR THE END
OF THE ARTICLE.

975
01:00:25,152 --> 01:00:28,053
THAT'S ENOUGH.
YOUR QUESTIONS ARE DUMB.

976
01:00:28,055 --> 01:00:35,427
THERE'S NO RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN SOCIAL STATUS

977
01:00:35,429 --> 01:00:37,997
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

978
01:00:39,666 --> 01:00:43,302
WE SHOULD START MOVING
INTO OUR POSITIONS.

979
01:00:45,872 --> 01:00:48,340
DOES EVERYONE KNOW
WHAT THEIR JOB IS?

980
01:00:48,342 --> 01:00:50,976
WESLEY?
STAY HERE.

981
01:00:50,978 --> 01:00:54,179
GUARD THE BASE.
PROTECT THE FLAG.

982
01:00:54,181 --> 01:00:57,950
GOOD.
JOKER?

983
01:00:59,085 --> 01:01:00,219
ATTACK FROM THE WEST.

984
01:01:00,221 --> 01:01:03,355
I STILL DON'T LIKE THIS.
WHAT IF THEY AMBUSH US?

985
01:01:03,357 --> 01:01:04,990
THEY CAN'T AMBUSH
THREE PEOPLE

986
01:01:04,992 --> 01:01:07,192
COMING FROM THREE
DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.

987
01:01:07,194 --> 01:01:09,928
THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
SOLDIERS.

988
01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:12,765
CALEB?

989
01:01:13,767 --> 01:01:17,169
GOOD.
AND I'LL COME IN

990
01:01:17,171 --> 01:01:19,438
LET'S SYNCHRONIZE
WATCHES.

991
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:22,941
EVERYONE IN POSITIONS
AT 1650.

992
01:01:22,943 --> 01:01:24,910
WE ATTACK
AT 1700 HOURS.

993
01:01:24,912 --> 01:01:28,914
MY WATCH DOESN'T
GO UP TO 1700.

994
01:01:31,151 --> 01:01:34,386
WESLEY...
YOU'RE THE KEY HERE.

995
01:01:34,388 --> 01:01:37,356
IF ANYONE COMES
INTO THIS BASE,

996
01:01:37,358 --> 01:01:40,359
YOU HAVE TO SHOOT THEM
AND KILL THEM.

997
01:01:40,361 --> 01:01:43,028
OKAY?
OKAY.

998
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:49,401
SAY IT.
SAY, "I WILL SHOOT

999
01:01:49,403 --> 01:01:55,174
I WILL SHOOT TO KILL.
I CAN DO IT.

1000
01:01:55,176 --> 01:01:57,342
I KNOW YOU CAN.

1001
01:01:57,344 --> 01:02:01,947
OKAY, PEOPLE--
1700 HOURS!

1002
01:02:05,985 --> 01:02:11,190
HEY, UM...
SORRY I HIT YOU BEFORE.

1003
01:02:11,192 --> 01:02:13,158
OKAY.

1004
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:16,929
I WAS JUST...
IT'S OKAY.

1005
01:02:16,931 --> 01:02:19,965
I FORGIVE YOU.

1006
01:02:19,967 --> 01:02:22,501
OKAY.

1007
01:02:22,503 --> 01:02:25,504
P.K.: JOKER!
LET'S GO!

1008
01:02:38,184 --> 01:02:40,319
J...

1009
01:02:41,955 --> 01:02:44,323
THAT WAS CRAZY
WITH THE WASPS, HUH?

1010
01:02:44,325 --> 01:02:46,325
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU
AFTER THAT?

1011
01:02:46,327 --> 01:02:47,960
I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU.

1012
01:02:47,962 --> 01:02:50,229
I SAW YOU.
WHAT?

1013
01:02:50,231 --> 01:02:53,799
SHE THINKS SHE'S,
LIKE-- COOL,

1014
01:02:53,801 --> 01:02:56,401
SHE'S STUPID.
SHE ASKED ME TO

1015
01:02:56,403 --> 01:03:00,072
HOW STUPID IS THAT?
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA

1016
01:03:00,074 --> 01:03:01,039
EAT IT?
GOD.

1017
01:03:01,041 --> 01:03:03,509
SHE'S PROBABLY
THE STUPIDEST GIRL

1018
01:03:03,511 --> 01:03:06,145
YOU CARRIED HER CROSSBOW.
SHE ASKED ME TO!

1019
01:03:06,147 --> 01:03:08,280
I DON'T WANT HER
TO HANG OUT WITH US.

1020
01:03:08,282 --> 01:03:11,950
SHE'S NOT EVEN LIKE US.
SHE PLAYS CHESS.

1021
01:03:11,952 --> 01:03:13,919
SHE WOULDN'T SHUT UP ABOUT
HOW MUCH SHE LOVES CHESS.

1022
01:03:13,921 --> 01:03:17,289
DO I LOOK LIKE
THE KIND OF GUY

1023
01:03:17,291 --> 01:03:18,891
( gasps )

1024
01:03:20,026 --> 01:03:21,527
BANG!

1025
01:03:22,595 --> 01:03:25,297
BANG!
BANG!

1026
01:03:26,533 --> 01:03:28,333
OH!
YOU GOT ME.

1027
01:03:28,335 --> 01:03:32,070
OH, NO, I'M DYING!

1028
01:03:32,072 --> 01:03:34,239
HOW COME I'M DYING
SO YOUNG?

1029
01:03:34,241 --> 01:03:38,911
OH, NO.
NO, PLEASE SAVE ME.

1030
01:03:38,913 --> 01:03:43,615
I-- I SEE THE LIGHT!
OH, OH...

1031
01:03:43,617 --> 01:03:46,518
MEDIC!
WHERE ARE YOU?

1032
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:50,322
NO...
( groans )

1033
01:03:54,627 --> 01:03:56,461
YES!

1034
01:04:02,302 --> 01:04:05,204
I'M GONNA BEAT THEM.
ALL OF THEM.

1035
01:04:05,206 --> 01:04:08,006
EVEN P.K.?
P.K. AND SKINNER.

1036
01:04:08,008 --> 01:04:11,476
I'M USING STRATEGY.
THEY WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

1037
01:04:11,478 --> 01:04:13,178
THEY DON'T PLAY CHESS.

1038
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:15,380
THIS IS THE MOST
ROMANTIC THING ANYONE

1039
01:04:15,382 --> 01:04:20,052
THAT'S WHY I THINK
YOU'LL LOVE FRANCE.

1040
01:04:20,054 --> 01:04:22,087
YEAH.
I REALLY WANNA

1041
01:04:22,089 --> 01:04:23,255
CAN I STILL COME
WITH YOU?

1042
01:04:23,257 --> 01:04:25,257
OF COURSE.
WE'LL LIVE THERE.

1043
01:04:25,259 --> 01:04:29,094
WHERE?
IN PARIS,

1044
01:04:29,096 --> 01:04:31,964
THAT'S TOTALLY AWESOME.

1045
01:04:44,644 --> 01:04:47,379
SHIT!

1046
01:05:46,272 --> 01:05:47,072
YES!

1047
01:05:47,074 --> 01:05:48,340
HA HA!
YOU'RE MINE!

1048
01:05:48,342 --> 01:05:53,412
EENY, MEENY, MINEY, MO,
CATCH A CHINK BY THE TOE...

1049
01:05:53,414 --> 01:05:55,681
YOU KNOW I'M
HALF KOREAN,

1050
01:05:55,683 --> 01:05:59,618
SHUT UP!
OH!

1051
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:01,453
GOOD JOB.

1052
01:06:01,455 --> 01:06:04,256
IT WAS SO COOL.
I SHOT HIM THREE TIMES.

1053
01:06:04,258 --> 01:06:06,158
HE WAS JUST STANDING
THERE BY A TREE!

1054
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,627
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
HE WASN'T HIDING?

1055
01:06:08,629 --> 01:06:10,295
NO, HE WAS RIGHT
OUT IN THE OPEN.

1056
01:06:10,297 --> 01:06:12,264
HE DIDN'T EVEN
FIGHT BACK.

1057
01:06:12,266 --> 01:06:14,066
GRAB HIM,
BOTH OF YOU.

1058
01:06:14,068 --> 01:06:17,302
WHY WEREN'T YOU
HIDING?

1059
01:06:17,304 --> 01:06:18,537
I GOT LOST.

1060
01:06:18,539 --> 01:06:22,207
DID YOU MAKE IT BACK
TO YOUR BASE?

1061
01:06:22,209 --> 01:06:23,775
NO.

1062
01:06:23,777 --> 01:06:24,743
INDIAN BURN.

1063
01:06:24,745 --> 01:06:28,647
URGH!
DID YOU TELL P.K.

1064
01:06:28,649 --> 01:06:32,651
NO, I SWEAR...
CHARLEY HORSE.

1065
01:06:33,786 --> 01:06:35,354
OH!

1066
01:06:35,356 --> 01:06:37,723
WHY ARE YOU STILL
LOYAL TO HIM?

1067
01:06:37,725 --> 01:06:39,224
WHERE'S THE BIG RESCUE?

1068
01:06:39,226 --> 01:06:41,693
ALL HE DID WAS
THE LAME THING WITH

1069
01:06:41,695 --> 01:06:47,366
HE'S USING YOU.
SO STOP PROTECTING

1070
01:06:48,434 --> 01:06:51,703
DID YOU TELL HIM
WHERE WE ARE?

1071
01:06:51,705 --> 01:06:53,739
NO!

1072
01:06:53,741 --> 01:06:55,107
( grunts )

1073
01:06:55,109 --> 01:06:57,509
WE'RE MOVING.
WE ARE?

1074
01:06:57,511 --> 01:06:58,577
YOU'RE NOT.
I AM.

1075
01:06:58,579 --> 01:07:00,212
I'M TAKING HIM
TO A NEW BASE.

1076
01:07:00,214 --> 01:07:01,646
THE ONE THAT WE
ALMOST USED THIS TIME.

1077
01:07:01,648 --> 01:07:05,183
FROM TWO TIMES AGO?
YOU CAN'T MOVE.

1078
01:07:05,185 --> 01:07:06,518
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO MOVE.

1079
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:08,587
OH, YEAH?
AND WHY NOT?

1080
01:07:08,589 --> 01:07:11,390
IT'S AGAINST
THE RULES.

1081
01:07:11,392 --> 01:07:14,359
OH, RIGHT.
THE RULES.

1082
01:07:14,361 --> 01:07:18,063
FUCK THE RULES!

1083
01:07:45,291 --> 01:07:48,760
READY TO GET YOUR
NOSE BROKEN, BITCH?

1084
01:07:48,762 --> 01:07:51,430
NO--
NO.

1085
01:08:02,208 --> 01:08:04,109
NO...

1086
01:08:09,515 --> 01:08:12,717
NO, NO, NO.
DON'T DO IT!

1087
01:08:12,719 --> 01:08:14,786
CAN'T HEAR YOU.

1088
01:08:14,788 --> 01:08:17,756
PLEASE!
PLEASE, NO!

1089
01:08:47,553 --> 01:08:49,354
UH--

1090
01:09:25,258 --> 01:09:26,958
( grunts )

1091
01:10:55,281 --> 01:10:59,551
HEY, AFTER THE WAR,
DO YOU WANNA COME OVER

1092
01:10:59,553 --> 01:11:03,822
SHUT UP.
WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM.

1093
01:11:03,824 --> 01:11:05,457
WHAT?

1094
01:11:07,059 --> 01:11:10,061
THERE'S NO FLAG.
SO?

1095
01:11:10,063 --> 01:11:12,397
SO, WHY WOULD ANYBODY
COME INTO THIS BASE?

1096
01:11:12,399 --> 01:11:15,834
IT'S DESERTED.
WE NEED A FLAG.

1097
01:11:15,836 --> 01:11:19,337
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

1098
01:11:19,339 --> 01:11:20,605
UH..

1099
01:11:20,607 --> 01:11:23,708
SOMEBODY SHOULD GO IN THERE
AND PUT IN A FAKE FLAG.

1100
01:11:23,710 --> 01:11:25,443
WE'LL TRICK 'EM.

1101
01:11:25,445 --> 01:11:27,679
YEAH.
I'LL DO IT.

1102
01:11:27,681 --> 01:11:29,481
I DUNNO,
MAYBE I SHOULD.

1103
01:11:29,483 --> 01:11:32,050
NO MAN, COME ON.
YOU GOTTA LET ME.

1104
01:11:32,052 --> 01:11:34,519
THIS IS SUCH
A GOOD IDEA.

1105
01:11:34,521 --> 01:11:36,388
I CAN DO IT.

1106
01:11:36,390 --> 01:11:39,491
FINE.
YOU DO IT.

1107
01:11:39,493 --> 01:11:42,794
SO, WHAT DO I DO?

1108
01:11:43,996 --> 01:11:46,831
WHAT COLOR IS YOUR GITCH?

1109
01:12:02,581 --> 01:12:04,849
GO NOW!

1110
01:12:39,151 --> 01:12:41,086
WHAT NOW?

1111
01:12:41,088 --> 01:12:44,489
JUST HIDE!

1112
01:13:20,593 --> 01:13:24,195
FROST,
WHAT DO I DO NOW?

1113
01:13:24,197 --> 01:13:26,865
FROST!

1114
01:13:29,702 --> 01:13:31,202
FROST,
WHAT DO I DO?

1115
01:13:31,204 --> 01:13:33,037
WHERE ARE YOU?

1116
01:13:33,039 --> 01:13:35,573
FROST!

1117
01:13:35,575 --> 01:13:38,209
( fires )

1118
01:13:40,212 --> 01:13:41,479
AH!

1119
01:13:41,481 --> 01:13:43,515
AAAH!

1120
01:14:24,089 --> 01:14:29,727
DON'T MOVE OR I SWEAR
I'LL KILL YOU.

1121
01:14:31,530 --> 01:14:35,099
DROP YOUR GUN, NOW.
DROP IT!

1122
01:14:36,168 --> 01:14:38,269
SKINNER WANTS TO SEE YOU.
YEAH?

1123
01:14:38,271 --> 01:14:40,805
WELL,
I WANT TO SEE HIM, TOO.

1124
01:14:40,807 --> 01:14:44,209
SHUT UP.
MOVE.

1125
01:14:46,912 --> 01:14:50,548
( mocking )
BYE, TREVOR...

1126
01:15:01,527 --> 01:15:03,595
NOT AGAIN.
SHUT UP!

1127
01:15:16,141 --> 01:15:18,109
STOP.

1128
01:15:20,079 --> 01:15:23,848
NOW YOU'RE GONNA
SEE THE REAL P.K.

1129
01:15:37,830 --> 01:15:39,330
HI.

1130
01:15:39,332 --> 01:15:41,933
HI.

1131
01:15:43,869 --> 01:15:46,271
SORRY I KILLED
YOUR FRIEND.

1132
01:15:46,273 --> 01:15:48,806
HE WASN'T MY FRIEND.

1133
01:15:48,808 --> 01:15:50,808
OH.

1134
01:15:50,810 --> 01:15:52,277
OKAY.

1135
01:15:52,279 --> 01:15:54,312
YOU'RE WESLEY, RIGHT?

1136
01:15:54,314 --> 01:15:55,213
YEAH.

1137
01:15:55,215 --> 01:16:00,018
OR "ALTAR BOY."
IN WAR, I'M ALTAR BOY.

1138
01:16:01,186 --> 01:16:03,321
MY NAME'S JESS.

1139
01:16:03,323 --> 01:16:05,156
YEAH, I KNOW.

1140
01:16:05,158 --> 01:16:07,892
WE HAVE GEOGRAPHY
TOGETHER.

1141
01:16:07,894 --> 01:16:08,726
OH, RIGHT.

1142
01:16:08,728 --> 01:16:12,697
YOU'RE THE KID WHO PRAYED
BEFORE THE TEST.

1143
01:16:15,367 --> 01:16:18,670
YOU CAN SIT IF YOU WANT.

1144
01:16:19,972 --> 01:16:23,074
SO, WHAT DID YOU GET
ON THAT TEST?

1145
01:16:23,076 --> 01:16:27,378
43.
SO IT DIDN'T WORK.

1146
01:16:28,714 --> 01:16:32,817
SO, IF IT DIDN'T WORK,
WHY DO YOU KEEP PRAYING?

1147
01:16:32,819 --> 01:16:34,018
I DON'T KNOW.

1148
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:37,922
WELL,
THAT'S KIND OF SILLY,

1149
01:16:37,924 --> 01:16:39,724
YEAH.

1150
01:16:39,726 --> 01:16:41,225
BUT IT KIND OF
DID WORK.

1151
01:16:41,227 --> 01:16:42,927
BECAUSE THEN I KNEW
I HAD TO STUDY.

1152
01:16:42,929 --> 01:16:46,664
SO, I STUDIED,
AND GOT A 71 ON

1153
01:16:46,666 --> 01:16:49,334
THAT'S GOOD.

1154
01:16:49,336 --> 01:16:52,270
GOD LOVES ME.

1155
01:16:52,272 --> 01:16:55,640
LOVE IS IMPORTANT.

1156
01:16:56,308 --> 01:16:59,844
CAN YOU DO ME
A FAVOR?

1157
01:16:59,846 --> 01:17:02,246
CAN I SEE YOUR GUN?

1158
01:17:02,248 --> 01:17:06,284
YEAH, OKAY.

1159
01:17:08,087 --> 01:17:10,321
IS IT YOURS?

1160
01:17:10,323 --> 01:17:12,857
YEAH.

1161
01:17:18,364 --> 01:17:21,232
IT'S NICE.

1162
01:17:21,834 --> 01:17:26,270
SO, NOW YOU NEVER
PRAY BEFORE A TEST?

1163
01:17:26,272 --> 01:17:29,974
NO.
I STUDY.

1164
01:17:33,012 --> 01:17:37,015
THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S A REAL LESSON.

1165
01:17:39,318 --> 01:17:40,685
THANKS, WESLEY.

1166
01:17:40,687 --> 01:17:44,889
I'LL SEE YOU IN SCHOOL
TOMORROW, PROBABLY.

1167
01:17:44,891 --> 01:17:47,392
BYE.

1168
01:18:54,893 --> 01:18:58,196
WE DID IT.
WE BEAT P.K.

1169
01:18:58,198 --> 01:18:59,530
YEAH.

1170
01:18:59,532 --> 01:19:01,999
HE GOT SIKORSKI,
THOUGH.

1171
01:19:02,001 --> 01:19:05,503
OH, WELL.
OH, WELL.

1172
01:19:06,538 --> 01:19:08,239
GO HOME, FROST.

1173
01:19:08,241 --> 01:19:11,943
WHAT?
GO HOME.

1174
01:19:11,945 --> 01:19:14,846
BUT I'M NOT DEAD YET.

1175
01:19:17,149 --> 01:19:20,251
OKAY.
YOU'RE DEAD.

1176
01:19:20,253 --> 01:19:22,987
YOU ASSHOLE!

1177
01:19:38,837 --> 01:19:42,240
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU WANNA SAY TO ME?

1178
01:19:42,242 --> 01:19:44,842
NO.

1179
01:19:44,844 --> 01:19:47,245
YOU KNOW I BEAT QUINN,
RIGHT?

1180
01:19:47,247 --> 01:19:48,412
I FIGURED.

1181
01:19:48,414 --> 01:19:51,983
I BEAT FROST.
I BEAT KWON TWICE.

1182
01:19:51,985 --> 01:19:54,452
AND I BEAT YOU.
I WON.

1183
01:19:54,454 --> 01:19:56,254
YOU DON'T HAVE
MY FLAG YET.

1184
01:19:56,256 --> 01:20:01,492
YOU DON'T WANT TO SAY
THAT YOU WERE WRONG

1185
01:20:01,494 --> 01:20:02,260
NO.

1186
01:20:02,262 --> 01:20:05,897
YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE FRIENDS AGAIN?

1187
01:20:07,065 --> 01:20:08,833
NOT REALLY.

1188
01:20:08,835 --> 01:20:13,871
BUT... I WON.
I BEAT EVERYBODY.

1189
01:20:13,873 --> 01:20:15,840
I TOLD YOU BEFORE.

1190
01:20:15,842 --> 01:20:18,109
I DON'T WANNA
BE YOUR FRIEND.

1191
01:20:18,111 --> 01:20:24,582
OH, BUT YOU'LL BE FRIENDS
WITH THAT PIECE OF SHIT?

1192
01:20:24,584 --> 01:20:27,318
YEAH.

1193
01:20:31,089 --> 01:20:34,358
BUT I'M BETTER
THAN HIM!

1194
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:38,329
YOU USED TO BE FRIENDS?

1195
01:20:38,331 --> 01:20:40,031
BEST FRIENDS.

1196
01:20:40,033 --> 01:20:42,867
BEFORE YOUR DUMB ASS
MOVED HERE.

1197
01:20:42,869 --> 01:20:44,502
NOW WE'RE GONNA
BE FRIENDS AGAIN,

1198
01:20:44,504 --> 01:20:49,473
BECAUSE P.K. ISN'T FRIENDS
WITH LOSERS LIKE YOU.

1199
01:20:49,475 --> 01:20:51,175
SKINNER...

1200
01:20:51,177 --> 01:20:54,078
LET HIM GO.

1201
01:20:56,949 --> 01:20:58,883
OKAY.
FINE.

1202
01:20:58,885 --> 01:21:00,151
KWON CAN BE INCLUDED.

1203
01:21:00,153 --> 01:21:01,485
IT COULD BE
THE THREE OF US.

1204
01:21:01,487 --> 01:21:03,487
I DON'T WANT TO BE
YOUR FRIEND.

1205
01:21:03,489 --> 01:21:05,423
WHY?
LOOK AT YOU.

1206
01:21:05,425 --> 01:21:07,592
YOU ALWAYS FREAK OUT
ABOUT NOTHING.

1207
01:21:07,594 --> 01:21:09,193
YOU'RE A TOTAL SPAZ.

1208
01:21:09,195 --> 01:21:12,263
EVERY TIME YOU LOSE
A GAME, YOU GO NUTS

1209
01:21:12,265 --> 01:21:15,366
AND THROW THE BOARD
ACROSS THE ROOM.

1210
01:21:17,269 --> 01:21:20,471
YOU'RE NO FUN
TO PLAY WITH.

1211
01:21:27,379 --> 01:21:30,248
OKAY.

1212
01:21:32,618 --> 01:21:35,119
YOU DON'T WANT
TO PLAY FAIR.

1213
01:21:35,121 --> 01:21:39,290
SO I WON'T PLAY FAIR.

1214
01:21:58,010 --> 01:22:01,145
I'VE JUST GOT TO GET
THE FLAG TO THE BASE.

1215
01:22:01,147 --> 01:22:02,513
YOU'RE AMAZING.

1216
01:22:02,515 --> 01:22:05,116
I KILLED EVERYONE
IN MY WAY.

1217
01:22:05,118 --> 01:22:07,718
OR OUTSMARTED THEM.
IT'S EASY.

1218
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:11,188
LIKE PLAYING CHESS
AGAINST A RETARD.

1219
01:22:12,624 --> 01:22:15,593
BUT WHY?
WHY DID YOU DO THIS?

1220
01:22:15,595 --> 01:22:16,661
FOR YOU.

1221
01:22:16,663 --> 01:22:20,264
COMPARED TO YOU,
EVERYONE'S A RETARD.

1222
01:22:20,266 --> 01:22:22,233
THAT'S SO INCREDIBLY
ROMANTIC.

1223
01:22:22,235 --> 01:22:25,369
WE'RE BOTH ROMANTIC.
WE'RE SOULMATES.

1224
01:22:25,371 --> 01:22:30,041
THAT'S WHY WE SHOULD LIVE
IN FRA...

1225
01:22:41,119 --> 01:22:42,219
GOOD BOY.

1226
01:22:42,221 --> 01:22:45,222
I'VE GOT SOMETHING
FOR YOU.

1227
01:22:50,228 --> 01:22:52,663
WAIT.
PLEASE DON'T KILL ME.

1228
01:22:52,665 --> 01:22:55,032
I DON'T EVEN CARE
ABOUT SKINNER.

1229
01:22:55,034 --> 01:22:58,536
I DON'T EVEN CARE
ABOUT YOUR STUPID WAR.

1230
01:22:59,471 --> 01:23:02,673
I JUST WANTED
TO GET THE FLAG.

1231
01:23:02,675 --> 01:23:06,010
FOR QUINN.

1232
01:23:12,384 --> 01:23:15,753
BECAUSE I LIKE HIM,
ALL RIGHT?

1233
01:23:15,755 --> 01:23:22,293
I LIKE HIM AND I WANTED
TO DO SOMETHING NICE

1234
01:23:34,706 --> 01:23:38,109
PLEASE, CALEB.

1235
01:23:39,778 --> 01:23:43,381
I LOVE HIM.

1236
01:23:45,751 --> 01:23:47,785
( explosion sounds )

1237
01:23:53,425 --> 01:23:55,626
I'LL GIVE YOU
A CHOICE.

1238
01:23:55,628 --> 01:23:59,063
YOU CAN RESCUE KWON
AND LEAVE...

1239
01:23:59,065 --> 01:24:00,631
BUT I WIN THE WAR.

1240
01:24:00,633 --> 01:24:02,366
YOU DON'T WIN UNTIL
YOU GET MY FLAG.

1241
01:24:02,368 --> 01:24:04,668
OR...
YOU WIN THE WAR...

1242
01:24:04,670 --> 01:24:06,771
AND I'LL NEVER BOTHER
YOU AGAIN.

1243
01:24:06,773 --> 01:24:11,409
BUT...
YOU HAVE TO CUT KWON.

1244
01:24:13,712 --> 01:24:16,213
WHAT YOU YOU MEAN,
"CUT"?

1245
01:24:16,215 --> 01:24:18,449
WHAT?
P.K.!

1246
01:24:18,451 --> 01:24:20,084
SHH!
YOU HAVE TO DRAW BLOOD.

1247
01:24:20,086 --> 01:24:24,655
HOWEVER YOU WANT.
ON HIS FACE.

1248
01:24:24,657 --> 01:24:27,725
NO WAY, P.K.--

1249
01:24:27,727 --> 01:24:32,430
JUST TAKE THE LOSS.
WHO CARES?

1250
01:24:36,835 --> 01:24:39,403
WHAT IF WE CALLED IT
A DRAW, AND YOU...

1251
01:24:39,405 --> 01:24:42,106
NO!
JUST TAKE IT

1252
01:24:42,108 --> 01:24:45,709
"A!"
WE'LL TAKE "A."

WHY DO YOU CARE?

1255
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:29,353
JUST LET HIM SAY HE WON.
IT'S NOT EVEN A REAL WIN.

1256
01:25:30,422 --> 01:25:33,624
IT WON'T EVEN HURT.
YES, IT WILL!

1257
01:25:33,626 --> 01:25:37,261
OKAY, JUST STOP
FOR A SECOND.

1258
01:25:45,504 --> 01:25:46,904
THINK ABOUT IT.
WE CAN TELL EVERYBODY

1259
01:25:46,906 --> 01:25:50,207
IT'S NOT A REAL WIN
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T GET

1260
01:25:50,209 --> 01:25:55,613
YOU OWE ME THIS!
I DID EVERYTHING

1261
01:25:55,615 --> 01:25:57,715
COME ON, P.K.,
DO IT.

1262
01:25:57,717 --> 01:26:03,854
THIS IS STUPID.
YOU'RE NOT LIKE THIS.

1263
01:26:08,293 --> 01:26:10,261
DO IT!

IS THAT BUZZING?

1267
01:26:19,572 --> 01:26:21,839
OOF!

1268
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:36,820
STOP.

1269
01:26:44,829 --> 01:26:47,298
YOU LOSE.

1270
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:56,674
YOU OKAY?

1271
01:26:56,676 --> 01:27:00,611
YEAH.
IT'S JUST A SCRATCH.

1272
01:27:00,613 --> 01:27:01,478
SORRY.

1273
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:05,950
MY HAND MUST HAVE SLIPPED
WHEN THE PLANE CRASHED.

YOU DON'T WANNA
KICK HIM OR SPIT

1275
01:27:13,758 --> 01:27:16,727
NO.

1276
01:27:26,871 --> 01:27:30,307
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING AT?

1277
01:27:30,309 --> 01:27:31,842
A LOSER, RIGHT?

1278
01:27:31,844 --> 01:27:34,378
EVERYBODY LOOK
AT THE LOSER.

1279
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:36,880
THE STUPID
FUCKING LOSER.

1280
01:27:36,882 --> 01:27:39,950
OH, YEAH?
WELL, I AM A LOSER, OKAY?

1281
01:27:39,952 --> 01:27:43,587
I'M A LOSER,
AND I CAN ACCEPT IT.

1282
01:27:43,589 --> 01:27:46,824
I'M GONNA DIE A LOSER.

1283
01:27:46,826 --> 01:27:50,995
YOU'RE JUST PERFECT.
ALWAYS THE WINNER.

1284

UP ON THAT THRONE
WITH YOUR BEST BUDDY.

WHAT?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

1292
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:49,119
I'M GOING HOME.

I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN

THINK THEY'RE WINNING,

1297
01:28:58,698 --> 01:29:02,032
AND THEN YOU LAUNCH
YOUR SECOND ATTACK.

1298
01:29:04,035 --> 01:29:06,537
OKAY.

1299
01:29:07,439 --> 01:29:10,941

WANNA WATCH?
