Well, l wasn't.

But it wasn't from lack of trying,
l can tell you that.

16
00:00:59,212 --> 00:01:02,409
Actually, Bill's last bullet
put me in a coma -

17
00:01:02,482 --> 00:01:05,815
a coma l was to lie in for four years.

18
00:01:06,553 --> 00:01:10,990
When l woke up, l went on what
the movie advertisements refer to as

19
00:01:11,057 --> 00:01:14,549
"a roaring rampage of revenge."

20
00:01:14,627 --> 00:01:17,653
l roared, and l rampaged,

21
00:01:17,731 --> 00:01:21,292
and l got bloody satisfaction.

22
00:01:21,368 --> 00:01:25,202
l've killed a hell of a lot of people
to get to this point,

23
00:01:25,271 --> 00:01:28,536

24
00:01:28,608 --> 00:01:30,667
The last one.

27
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,913

51
00:03:15,415 --> 00:03:18,748
How 'bout "Love Me Tender"?
l can play that.

00:03:18,818 --> 00:03:20,809
- Sure.
- Yeah.

53
00:03:20,887 --> 00:03:23,219
"Love Me Tender" would be great.

55
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:29,519
Rufus, who was that

00:03:29,596 --> 00:03:31,587
Rufus Thomas.

Rufus Thomas.
Rufus Thomas.

58
00:03:34,634 --> 00:03:38,968
l was a Drell. l was a Drifter.
l was a Coaster.

59
00:03:39,038 --> 00:03:42,633
l was part of the Gang.
l was a Barkay.

60
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:46,907
lf they come through Texas,
l done played with 'em.

61
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,438
Rufus - he's the man.

62
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,715
- Have l forgotten anything?
- Um...

63
00:03:55,788 --> 00:03:59,280
Oh yes, you forgot, uh,
the seating arrangements.

64
00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:02,021
- Thank you, Mother.
- Yes.

65
00:04:02,095 --> 00:04:04,325
Now, the way we normally do this -

66
00:04:04,397 --> 00:04:08,493
we have the bride's side,
and then we have the groom's side.

67
00:04:08,568 --> 00:04:11,799
But since the bride
ain't got nobody comin',

68
00:04:11,871 --> 00:04:15,807
and the groom's got
far too many people comin'...

69
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:19,140
Well, yeah, they're comin'
all the way from Oklahoma.

70
00:04:20,613 --> 00:04:22,080
Right...

71
00:04:22,148 --> 00:04:25,140
Well, l don't see no problem with...

72
00:04:25,218 --> 00:04:28,483
...the groom's side
sharing the bride's side.

73
00:04:28,555 --> 00:04:31,615
- Do you, Mother?
- l don't have a problem with that.

74
00:04:31,691 --> 00:04:33,420
But, uh...

75
00:04:33,493 --> 00:04:37,725
Honey, you know, it would be good
if you had <i>somebody</i> come.

76
00:04:37,797 --> 00:04:39,958
You know, as a sign of good faith?

77
00:04:41,834 --> 00:04:43,961
Well, l don't have anybody...

78
00:04:44,037 --> 00:04:47,973
...except for Tommy and my friends.

79
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:52,478
- You have no family?
- Well, l'm workin' on changing that.

80
00:04:52,545 --> 00:04:56,811
Mrs. Harmony, we're all the family
this little angel's ever gonna need.

00:05:02,655 --> 00:05:06,056
So while y'all blather on,
l'm gonna go outside and get some air.

83
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:09,253
OK. Um, uh, Reverend, sorry, uh...

84
00:05:09,329 --> 00:05:12,958
- She's gonna go out and get some air.
- Yeah. Given her delicate condition...

85
00:05:13,032 --> 00:05:15,694
She just needs a few minutes
to get it together. She'll be OK.

- Why are you here?
- Last look.

97
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:28,227
- Are you gonna be nice?
- l've never been nice in my whole life.

98
00:07:30,203 --> 00:07:33,536
But l'll do my best to be sweet.

99
00:07:34,006 --> 00:07:35,803
Hmm.

100
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:38,309
l always told you...

101
00:07:38,378 --> 00:07:41,711
...your sweet side is you best side.

102
00:07:41,781 --> 00:07:46,275
l guess that's why you're
the only one who's ever seen it.

103
00:07:48,688 --> 00:07:52,021
- So you got a bun in the oven.
- Hmm.

104
00:07:54,394 --> 00:07:57,557
- l'm knocked up.
- Jeez, Louise.

105
00:07:58,965 --> 00:08:04,232
That young man of yours sure doesn't
believe in wasting time, does he?

106
00:08:04,303 --> 00:08:06,863
Have you seen Tommy?

107
00:08:09,075 --> 00:08:12,203
- Big guy in the tux?
- Yes.

108
00:08:12,278 --> 00:08:14,405
Then l saw him.

109
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,674
l like his hair.

110
00:08:19,018 --> 00:08:21,384
You promised you'd be nice.

111
00:08:23,322 --> 00:08:27,281
No, l said l'd do my best.
That's hardly a promise.

112
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,358
But you're right.

113
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:33,524
What does your young man
do for a living?

114
00:08:35,334 --> 00:08:38,269
He owns a used record store
here in El Paso.

115
00:08:38,337 --> 00:08:43,036
- Ah. Music lover, eh?
- He's fond of music.

00:08:44,177 --> 00:08:46,372
Aren't we all?

117
00:08:50,016 --> 00:08:53,816
And what are you doing
for a J-O-B these days?

118
00:08:55,388 --> 00:08:58,448
l work in the record store.

119
00:08:58,524 --> 00:09:01,982

00:09:07,567 --> 00:09:11,970
- Do you like it?
- Yeah. l like it a lot, smartass.

122
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:15,767
l get to listen to music all day...

123
00:09:15,842 --> 00:09:19,835
...talk about music all day.
lt's really cool.

124
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,343
lt's gonna be a great environment
for my little girl to grow up in.

125
00:09:27,186 --> 00:09:31,885
As opposed to jetting around the world,
killing human beings,

126
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:36,759
and being paid vast sums of money?

127
00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:38,160
Precisely.

128
00:09:38,231 --> 00:09:41,223

132
00:09:51,911 --> 00:09:57,178
l happen to be, more or less,
particular whom my gal marries.

133
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:03,480
- You want to come to the wedding?
- Only if l can sit on the bride's side.

134
00:10:05,224 --> 00:10:07,658
You'll find it a bit lonely on my side.

135
00:10:07,727 --> 00:10:11,185
Your side always was a bit lonely.

136
00:10:11,931 --> 00:10:14,297
But l wouldn't sit anywhere else.

137
00:10:16,669 --> 00:10:18,694
You know...

138
00:10:18,771 --> 00:10:21,239
...l had the loveliest dream about you...

139
00:10:21,307 --> 00:10:23,741
Oh, here's Tommy!
Call me Arlene.

140

- Oh, l'm fine.

143

00:10:37,523 --> 00:10:39,286
Oh, my God, this is great!

146
00:10:39,358 --> 00:10:42,156

147
00:10:42,228 --> 00:10:44,526
The name's Bill.

148
00:10:44,597 --> 00:10:46,929
Well, it's great to meet you... Bill.

149
00:10:46,999 --> 00:10:50,196
- Arlene told me you couldn't make it.
- Surprise.

150
00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:53,534
That's my pop for ya.
Always full of surprises.

151
00:10:53,606 --> 00:10:57,007
Well, in the surprise department...

152
00:10:57,076 --> 00:11:00,512
...the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

153
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,741
- When did you get in?
- Just now.

154
00:11:02,815 --> 00:11:05,943
- Did you come straight from Australia?
- Of course.

155
00:11:06,018 --> 00:11:09,818
Daddy, l told Tommy that you were
in Perth mining for silver, and...

156
00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:11,948
...no one could reach you.

157
00:11:12,024 --> 00:11:15,289
Lucky for us all, that's not the case.

158
00:11:15,361 --> 00:11:17,454
So...

159
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:21,296
What's this all about?
l've heard of wedding rehearsals,

160
00:11:21,367 --> 00:11:25,599
but l don't believe l've ever heard of
a wedding dress rehearsal before.

161
00:11:25,671 --> 00:11:27,002
We thought,

162
00:11:27,073 --> 00:11:30,270
"Why pay so much money for a dress
you're only gonna wear once?"

163
00:11:30,343 --> 00:11:33,335
Especially when Arlene looks
so goddamn beautiful in it.

164
00:11:33,412 --> 00:11:37,143
So, l think we're gonna try to get
all the mileage we can out of it.

165
00:11:38,551 --> 00:11:41,850
lsn't it supposed to be bad luck
for the groom to see the bride

166
00:11:41,921 --> 00:11:44,947
in her wedding dress
before the ceremony?

167
00:11:45,725 --> 00:11:49,320
Well, l guess l just believe
in living dangerously.

168
00:11:51,163 --> 00:11:53,290
l know just what you mean.

169
00:11:53,366 --> 00:11:56,563
<i>(Reverend)</i> Son.
Some of us have places to be.

170
00:11:56,636 --> 00:11:58,297
<i>(Rufus)</i> Sure do.

171
00:11:58,371 --> 00:12:02,808
