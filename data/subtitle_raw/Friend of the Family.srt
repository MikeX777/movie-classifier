Back then,

9
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,402
I don't think I knew who I was.

10
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,493
I'm sorry for dragging you out all the way out here.

11
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,349
You're probably thinking it's nothing but mountains.

12
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,150
No, not really.

13
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,152
Onomichi, where you grew up,

14
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,154
was a small but lively port city.

15
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,357
Compared to that, my hometown is a small town in the mountains.

16
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,760
I vaguely remember it. I went to kindergarten here.

17
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,861
You're right.

18
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:44,064
Shinshuu (Nagano area) is also your home.

19
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,198
It's dad's too.

20
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,503
Don't talk about your dad.

21
00:02:46,603 --> 00:02:50,103
I just want you to be happy here.

22
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:52,271
You make it sound so easy.

23
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,673
Divorce of his parents,

24
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:56,276
is very traumatizing for a boy in his puberty.

25
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:59,678
Why are you tormenting me?

26
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,972
I'm more hurt by it than anyone else!

27
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,320
Was that from Akemi?

28
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,089
Yeah.

29
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,091
Why didn't you reply?

30
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,094
Trying to forget eases the pain of breaking up, right?

31
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:18,198
I knew you two were in that kind of relationship!

32
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,201
Is that the cell phone strap your dad bought for you?

33
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:25,038
What, does it hurt your feelings that I'm still keeping it?

34
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:27,209
As if I get hurt so easily!

35
00:03:27,238 --> 00:03:29,009
- Really?
- Really.

36
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,911
I'm hungry.

37
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:33,413
You just ate lunch when we transferred in Nagoya.

38
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:35,015
A boy in puberty

39
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,217
gets hungry before he gets traumatized.

40
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:41,519
I wish a mother of a boy in his growth spurt would at least know that!

41
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:44,014
Who do you think you're talking to?

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,200
<i>Shinshuu, City of Nagano</i>

43
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,993

00:04:17,256 --> 00:04:18,760
Sit down.

51
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,262
As Yamamoto's grandfather said,

52
00:04:23,362 --> 00:04:27,164
traditional standing greetings are the best.

53
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,293
I will now introduce you to a new classmate.

54
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:36,998
He's Saitou Kazuo.

55
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:42,281
Saitou moved here from Onomichi, Hiroshima Prefecture.

56
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,283
Do you all know where Onomichi is?

57
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,286
It's a lively city by the Seto Inland Sea.

58
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,690
But you used to live right here in Nagano when you were little, right?

59
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,192
Yes.

60
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,329
Is that you, Kazuo?

61
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,330
Right, you're Kazuo.

62
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:00,299
You're that Kazuo!

63
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,693
Kazumi...

64
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,400
Remember we were sleeping, and you wet the bed!

65
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:06,504
Kazuo and Kazumi?

66
00:05:06,505 --> 00:05:08,607
Are you brother and sister with similar names?

67
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:11,011
No, no way!

68
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:12,812
Brother and sister!

69
00:05:12,911 --> 00:05:15,215
Quiet down, everyone!

70
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:19,318
You and Kazumi are childhood friends?

71
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,320
That's great! You already have a friend then.

72
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,323
That's not how it is.

73
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:25,424
How can that be? I said I'll marry you when we grow up,

74
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,425
and even kissed you!

75
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:33,134
I said no!

76
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:36,568
I'm sure he's Kazuo from my kindergarten class.

77
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:37,437
He has to be.

78
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:40,240
Same family name, just Kazumi's "mi" changed to "o",

79
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,642
so people always asked if we were brother and sister!

80
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:45,245
Is that another one of your wild imaginations?

81
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,346
No, no. This is real,

82
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,949
This is the truth.

83
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:50,851
Then, you two were very close?

84
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:52,353
You just said you kissed him...

85
00:05:52,354 --> 00:05:54,354
That's like a greeting between kids.

86
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,456
My first real kiss was with you, Hiroshi.

87
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,858
During summer break, after that campfire!

88
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,161
Don't talk about that here...

89
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,397
You haven't kissed me since.

90
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,299
Kazumi!

91
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,602
You kissed Saitou while sleeping with him?

92
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,603
He kissed you and wet his bed...

93
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:13,473
<i>then</i> what did you two do?

94
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:14,672
We had a nap.

95
00:06:14,673 --> 00:06:16,375
His underwear was wet,

96
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,378
so my mom made him wear mine!

97
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,381
Then he went back home, and tried to pee in the toilet,

98
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,083
but couldn't get his wee-wee out,

99
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:26,185
so he panicked, screaming "my wee-wee is gone!"

100
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:28,187
It's true, his mom told me.

101
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:30,390
Kazumi...
- And after we took a bath together...

102
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,092
Stop it already.

103
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:33,593
What's the matter, Hiroshi?

104
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:36,296
So, the kindergarten is the setting of your fairy tale this time?

105
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,798
You really have a wild imagination!

106
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,799
But Kazuo's wee-wee was really...

107
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,401
Enough already!

108
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,403
- You were listening?
- I was!

109
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:48,408
I'll never forget the pain of my thing being pulled as you screamed "I want one too!"

110
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:50,310
I knew it was you.

111
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,211
I knew it was you!

112
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:55,414
Stop telling everyone about something that happened so long ago...

113
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,416
Oh, he's Hiroshi.

114
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,918
Yamamoto Hiroshi.

115
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,421
He's the class president, and my boyfriend.

116
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:03,323
I'm Yamamoto Hiroshi.

117
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,325
Nice to meet you.

118
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,328
I'm Saitou Kazuo, nice to meet you.

119
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,929
By the way, Saitou...

120
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:14,533
<i>this</i> Saitou sometimes slip into the world of her imagination.

121
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:16,435
In other words, her imagination is quite wild.

122
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,037
So, Saitou Kazuo,

123
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:20,539
don't let her confuse you about what really happened.

124
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,442
Kazumi, I'll let you borrow this book.

125
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,445
I think you should read more advanced books.

126
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,247
"The Sickness Unto Death...

127
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:30,049
Kierkegaard"?

128
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,352
One of your grandfather's books?

129
00:07:31,353 --> 00:07:33,752
Yes, it's about the World and God, reality and imagination,

130
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:37,457
and the inevitability of inauthentic despair.
You will find the meaning to life.

131
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:41,550
What's with him?
He's the exact definition of the word "pompous"!

132
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:45,666
Ow, what did you do that for?

133
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:50,159
But who's "Kierkegaard"?

134
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:54,474
<i>Then, it happened after school that day.</i>

135
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,475
Hey, Kazuo.

136
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,177
You moved to Onomichi because of your dad's work, right?

137
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:00,979
Did you move for the same reason this time too?

138
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,383
Who cares? It's all in the past.

139
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,418
But I'm curious.

140
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,720
Is your family still in the udon noodle business?

141
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,489
Not udon, it's soba noodle!

142
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,590
I can't believe you forgot!

143
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:14,427
You used to love my grandpa's soba.

144
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,828
Really? It wasn't a udon restaurant?

145
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,530
I'm really good at making udon, you know!
( Udon: Thick noodles made of wheat )

146
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:20,532
Udon is made from nothing but wheat.
( Udon: Thick noodles made of wheat )

147
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:22,535
That's why it tastes so good!

148
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:26,206
So? Soba is good for your health.
( Soba: Thin noodles made of buckwheat )

149
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:28,607
Plenty of vitamin B1 in the noodle,

150
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:31,610
and the soup contains lots of protein and rutin.

151
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,513
It prevents aging.

152
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:36,416
Look, it's Kazumi. Completely absorbed by her imagination again!

153
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:40,019
Masae...
- You two sure seem to get along well.

154
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,424
Yuka...

155
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,024
Wait, Kazuo!

156
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:48,128
Should I tell Yamamoto Hiroshi?

157
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,330
Hiroshi is a philosophy nerd,

158
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:53,032
so he's got a big brain,

159
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:56,136
but nothing down there!

160
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,629
Kazuo, wait!

161
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:03,243
Kazuo!!

162
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:06,445
Please, OK? Grandpa?

163
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:12,040
I just called home to let them know you're coming over to eat soba.

164
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,255
Who let you decide?

165
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:18,658
What, are you in a position to argue with me?

166
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:20,160
What?

167
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,463
I haven't told anyone about that secret.

168
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,466
Secret? What secret?

169
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,570
That you killed my grandma.

170
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,672
Huh?

171
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,575
<i>Once upon a time, Kazuo and Kazumi came home from kindergarten,</i>

172
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,580
<i>and saw a fly entering grandma's mouth.</i>

173
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:48,584
<i>Incredibly, Kazuo suddenly started spraying insecticide into grandma's mouth!</i>

174
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,604
<i>Pshhh, pshhh!</i>

175
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,403
<i>And so, the fly and grandma were both exterminated.</i>

176
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,606
- Mother? <i>The end.</i>

177
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,608
Kazuo, Kazuo!

178
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,778
Don't run.

179
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,614
You can't escape.

180
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:17,207
My home is this way.

181
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,321
Hey! You forgot our restaurant too?

182
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:23,725
Huh?

183
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:29,418
This is my home, where you wet the bed.

184
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:34,823
Why are you talking about wetting a bed in front of a restaurant?!

185
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,538
Oh, wow.

186
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,842
That little bed-wetting Kazuo has grown up!

187
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,643
Bed-wetter!

188
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,345
You wore Kazumi's underwear home, right?

189
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:48,548
Panties!

190
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,049
I don't remember that...

191
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,551
It happened so long ago, he wouldn't remember.

192
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:53,553
Yes...

193
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,555
But Kazuo back then was so funny...

194
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,557
Kazumi! Don't go around embarrassing the man.

195
00:10:58,657 --> 00:10:59,559
But...

196
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,461
Embarrassing man!

197
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:03,601
Want to eat some? I remember you used to like soba.

198
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,065
Kazuo has turned into a udon enthusiast.

199
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,167
Udon?

200
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:11,471
How did that happen?
They don't have a good soba shop in Onomichi?

201
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,174
Actually, there was a good udon shop.

202
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:17,075
Udon and soba are both kneaded with water.

203
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,578
I know, Kazumi.

204
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,980
Why don't you take Kazuo to the Spring of Sabishira?

205
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,482
It might bring back memories.

206
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:25,685
The Spring of Sabishira?
- Sa-Bi-Shi-Ra?

207
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:28,687
It's a spring where we get the water for our soba.

208
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,190
Don't you remember going there when we were kids?

209
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,926
No... sorry.

210
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,727
Then, go take him there, Kazumi.

211
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:38,731
We'll have delicious soba prepared when you get back.

212
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:44,924
You're the one who's supposed to treat me to soba.
( Old Japanese tradition: the new arrival makes soba for neighbors. )

213
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:50,809
Shall we go? Into the world of our story?

214
00:11:50,909 --> 00:11:52,346
OK.

215
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,039
Be careful!

216
00:11:55,146 --> 00:11:57,139
We'll be back soon.

217
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,921
I'm glad she's playing outside.

218
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:06,924
Unlike me, she totally lacks masculinity!

219
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,762
Masculinity!

220
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,763
This way, Kazuo.

221
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,733
Huh? Oh.

222
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,636
How big is your family?

223
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,838
Let's see... my dad, mom,

224
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,741
grandpa, and an older brother.

225
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,244
But my brother is working in Tokyo,

226
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,746
and we're taking care of his only daughter, Kazuko.

227
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,549
Her mom passed away.

228
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:32,352
Then, it's a family of 6, including you.

229
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:35,455
Yes, since you killed my grandma.

230
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:37,357
What? Hold on...

231
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,360
The Spring of Sabishira.

232
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,663
Is your family just you and both of your parents?

233
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,765
No, it's a family of 2.

234
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,766
This way,

235
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,170
it's up there.

236
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,772
Do you remember anything?

237
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,365
No.

238
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:02,814
Male's Gate and Female's Gate.

239
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:04,816
You're a boy, so...

240
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,410
this way.

241
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,809
Kazuo, the water here is really great!

242
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,016
That's also why our soba tastes great.

243
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:38,109
I see.

244
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,824
You really don't remember?

245
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,826
My grandpa took us here

246
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,320
many times when we were little.

247
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:01,840
I remember very clearly while you don't remember at all.

248
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,477
Isn't that unfair?

249
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:06,746
I wonder why?

250
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:10,883
Maybe I was trying hard to forget about you.

251
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:14,253
Because you'd miss me if you remember? Or...

252
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:17,746
because you wanted to forget about killing my grandma?

253
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,931
<i>My mind went blank.</i>

254
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,033
<i>I went home...</i>

255
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,327
<i>without knowing what just happened.</i>

256
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,700
( Notice of store closure... )

257
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:52,141
Kazuo, did you just get back?

258
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,205
It's so hot in here.

259
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:11,731
You!

260
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,034
Me?

261
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,437
Ow.

262
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:20,340
Gone...

263
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,142
It's gone!

264
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,046
Why are you making so much noise, Kazuo?

265
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,701
Who are you?

266
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:30,048
- Mom...
- Mom?

267
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,251
Kazuo! He brought a weird girl home on the moving day?

268
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:36,054
Half-naked too... what are you doing?!

269
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,456
Where are you, Kazuo?

270
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:39,057
I'm Kazuo...

271
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,959
I don't know who you are, but...

272
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,761
Aren't you ashamed of being naked like that?

273
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:44,764
What have you been doing with my Kazuo?!

274
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:46,666
What have I been doing?

275
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:48,968
I went to the Spring of Sabishira with Kazumi and...

276
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,069
Kazumi? Is that...

277
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,666
That Kazumi from the Saitou soba restaurant?

278
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,276
You're Kazumi?

279
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:58,477
But why aren't you wearing anything?

280
00:17:58,478 --> 00:17:59,971
It's not like that...

281
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,393
Anyway, do something about your appearance!

282
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,002
Now tell me, where's Kazuo?

283
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,091
Where?

284
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,486
Wait, Kazumi!
Where are you going, dressed like that?

285
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,933
What's on earth is this?
Kazumi?

286
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,826
Just tell me, what happened to Kazumi?

287
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:48,528
Is she safe?

288
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,032
I'm telling you mommy, I'm Kazumi!

289
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,636
He probably bumped his head against a rock!

290
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,938
Grandpa!

291
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:00,840
Idiot, look how pathetic you're making me look!

292
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:02,344
Stop crying like a wuss!

293
00:19:02,444 --> 00:19:04,044
It's me, Kazumi's body!

294
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,803
This one's Kazumi too!

295
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:07,246
Get off me!

296
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:10,950
Kazumi, why are you dressed like that?

297
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,151
Geez, Kazumi.

298
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,755
Your mom is scary despite her appearance!

299
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:17,557
That... that's not true!

300
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,659
You're still saying things like that?!

301
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:21,761
Mom, don't hit me!

302
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:24,664
Don't scar a girl before she finds a man!

303
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:26,966
Exactly, grandpa is right, old lady.

304
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:28,868
"Old lady"?!
- Old lady?

305
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,001
Mom, stop it!

306
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,104
This is hopeless!

307
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,607
Wait, Kazumi!

308
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:36,877
Bag, take your bag!

309
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,770
This is hopeless!

310
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:45,987
Get on.

311
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,091
Not like that! Open your legs.

312
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,984
Hold on.

313
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,999
What a ridiculous double ride!

314
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,200
Wait, that's against the law!

315
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,694
Wait!

316
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:15,314
Hey, put your hands down.

317
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:17,117
It hurts when someone grabs my boobs.

318
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:19,619
Perv! You played with my breasts, didn't you?

319
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,323
"My breasts"?

320
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:23,323
Well, they may belong to you,

321
00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:25,421
but they're on me right now.

322
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:27,826
You can have them back if you want!

323
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:29,829
But in exchange, give me back my nuts!

324
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:32,331
You scum, idiot, pervert!

325
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,033
Knock it off!

326
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:36,135
And what's with this appearance?

327
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,038
My panties are clearly showing!

328
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:41,141
Fine, sorry about that!

329
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:43,843
But... what now?

330
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,499
My mom was telling me to go home,

331
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,304
but I don't even know where you live!

332
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:53,353
Right...

333
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:57,055
Anyway, just for today...

334
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:59,057
I'll be you, and you'll be me.

335
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:01,060
There's nothing else we can do.

336
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,763
Let's walk.

337
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,965
We're not kids.

338
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:07,752
Whether it's dream or reality,

339
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:10,060
let's just think it through.

340
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,402
My home is this way.

341
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,483
What are we going to do?

342
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,183
Let's discuss it inside.

343
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,676
We've got to do something about this.

344
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:32,191
Where have you been hiding for so long?

345
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,892
It's not like that, mom.

346
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:36,094
This is Kazumi, and I'm Kazuo!

347
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:38,097
This girl is still not making any sense.

348
00:21:38,098 --> 00:21:41,101
Stop trying to seduce my Kazuo!

349
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:43,303
What's wrong, Kazuo?

350
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:46,105
No! This is Kazumi!

351
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,308
I'm sorry, Kazumi. Please leave for today.

352
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:51,101
Hang in there!

353
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,226
This is yours, isn't it?

354
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:08,719
Go home already!

355
00:22:28,748 --> 00:22:31,650
Excuse me... I mean, I'm home.

356
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,548
Thank you for waiting.

357
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,762
Where have you been?

358
00:22:41,862 --> 00:22:44,463
I told you to enter from the back during this time.

359
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:46,466
We have customers here!

360
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,469
Hurry and eat dinner.

361
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:54,062
Why did you bring back the dipper?

362
00:22:54,674 --> 00:22:57,676
Tell grandpa to take this back tomorrow.

363
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:58,779
OK.

364
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:02,472
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.

365
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:18,498
Auntie ate mine!

366
00:23:18,596 --> 00:23:19,797
Call me sis.

367
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:22,200
I'm the only child.

368
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:24,204
You don't even like oyster mushrooms.

369
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,405
It's first come, first serve today!

370
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:28,108
Kazumi, get me the rice.

371
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:30,410
Your mom is busy cleaning up the restaurant.

372
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,803
Fine...

373
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,713
Another bowl!

374
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,202
What's wrong, Kazumi?

375
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,671
No appetite today?

376
00:24:31,871 --> 00:24:33,274
No...

377
00:24:34,674 --> 00:24:36,467
Her stomach is growling!

378
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,499
I finally finished cleaning up!

379
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,401
Kazumi...

380
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,402
I'm glad you can eat oyster mushrooms, but...

381
00:25:04,403 --> 00:25:08,105
you're a girl! Where are your manners?

382
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:09,808
Go back to your own seat.

383
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,410
That way, auntie!

384
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,611
Come on...

385
00:25:12,612 --> 00:25:13,614
Sake...

386
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:17,807
For me too.

387
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:34,833
I'm home!

388
00:25:35,933 --> 00:25:38,735
I talked to our landlord after greeting the neighbors.

389
00:25:38,736 --> 00:25:42,629
She happens to be a quite a talker!
I ended up having a long chat with her.

390
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,543
This bar used to be very popular in the past,

391
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:50,148
but they got beaten by new competition nearby.

392
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:55,254
"An old woman like me can't keep up with the trends",
she said with a smile.

393
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,556
Look, she gave me some persimmon!

394
00:25:57,956 --> 00:25:59,958
Sorry I'm late, you must be hungry.

395
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:02,561
Should we just order some noodles?

396
00:26:03,961 --> 00:26:05,564
Where did you get this?

397
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:07,466
I made it.

398
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,859
<i>You</i> did? By yourself?

399
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:13,964
Yes.

400
00:26:14,171 --> 00:26:16,864
Feeling depressed will only make me even sadder.

401
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,578
Sorry for using the food without asking you.

402
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:23,582
What? You always take the food without asking!

403
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:27,884
I asked the landlord to leave her old appliances here.

404
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:30,389
Oh, yes... right.

405
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,791
By the way, what do you have to be depressed about?

406
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:34,892
About Akemi?

407
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:36,595
Or that weird Kazumi?

408
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:38,499
Who's Akemi?

409
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,803
You miss her after all!

410
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:48,505
You must be doing all this because you're worried about me.

411
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:52,211
No, I'm just trying to imitate other people's cooking.

412
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:56,404
Really? But sometimes it tastes horrible when you do that!

413
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:01,520
Wow, it tastes great!

414
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,621
What's gotten into you, Kazuo?

415
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,424
- Is it good?
- Yes!

416
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:06,926
Then I'm relieved.

417
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:09,428
- By the way...
- Yes?

418
00:27:09,528 --> 00:27:11,629
Daddy... I mean,

419
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,532
When's dad coming home?

420
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:17,536
Kazuo, are you still saying that to hurt my feelings?

421
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:21,040
No, um, err...

422
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,543
You're being so difficult lately.

423
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,579
You even brought some weird girl home.

424
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,680
All this stress...

425
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:32,374
it's a great diet!

426
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:39,391
Let's eat. I'm happy my son cooked for me.

427
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,284
Thank you for the meal.
- Thank you for the meal.

428
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:48,391
Ah, TV!

429
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:57,074
What are you doing, I turned it on.

430
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:59,777
This is my TV time.

431
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:01,580
I don't care.

432
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,782
Kazumi, it's not your turn.

433
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:08,576
You guys actually have a rule like that?
- What's gotten into you?

434
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:11,189
Never mind.

435
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:17,496
Don't worry, I'll do the dishes.

436
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:21,498
Hey, Kazuo, you can watch the bar's TV.

437
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,702
TV?

438
00:28:22,802 --> 00:28:25,704
What's it called? That classical music show you watch every week.

439
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:28,706
You know, the one you used to watch with Akemi.

440
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:32,311
She must be the reason you started learning piano.

441
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,712
Akemi is good at everything,

442
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,715
good mannered. I really liked her.

443
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:41,709
I hope you'll make a friend like her in this school too.

444
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,724
Right... but I'll clean these.

445
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:50,718
Oh? But you don't have to worry about me.

446
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:55,234
Doing something is better than nothing.

447
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,537
Actually, I need to use the bathroom first...

448
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,440
Huh? You don't have to ask me.

449
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,143
Oh, right.

450
00:29:04,643 --> 00:29:06,645
Well then...

451
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,747
Don't read books in there!

452
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,750
I'm using it soon too.

453
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:16,952
Geez, where did he pick up that strange habit?

454
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,760
"The Sickness Unto Death"?

455
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,763
"Kierkegaard", what a weird name.

456
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:29,166
I thought this would relax me, but it's the complete opposite!

457
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:30,801
Auntie, are you done yet?

458
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:33,804
Kazumi, how long are you going to be in there?

459
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:35,408
Diarrhea?

460
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:38,776
What's that?

461
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,778
What's with you?

462
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,781
When did you start reading books in the bathroom?

463
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,783
When? I have for a long time...

464
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,785
Whatever, hurry and use it.

465
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:50,789
I'm also waiting for the bathroom.

466
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:53,182
Kazumi, show me that book.

467
00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:57,787
I'll go after you.
- You can go before me...

468
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,701
Where's the phone?

469
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,802
What's wrong with you, Kazuo?

470
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,596
The phone is over there.

471
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,114
He's strange tonight.

472
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:18,717
Why are you just sitting there, Kazumi?

473
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,818
Hurry and clean up, then make tea for everyone.

474
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,622
And what's with this disturbing book?

475
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,823
Something Unto Death?

476
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,025
I have to make tea?

477
00:30:27,026 --> 00:30:29,728
Of course! And what's with the boy talk?

478
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,830
(Girl Talk:) I have to make tea?
- Yes.

479
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,734
Don't worry about the tea, get the phone.

480
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,337
Damn, what a busy house.

481
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,038
What are you doing? Get the phone!

482
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,741
Right, phone...

483
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,444
She must have bumped her head too.

484
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:47,537
I'll make tea!

485
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,846
Where's the phone...

486
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,261
Oh, here it is.

487
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,663
Hello?

488
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:06,765
It's me, Kazumi.

489
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,866
I know that, it's my own voice.

490
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,270
Kazuo, there's an emergency with your body.

491
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,373
Emergency?

492
00:31:12,473 --> 00:31:15,576
The shape... suddenly changed!

493
00:31:15,676 --> 00:31:17,078
Shape? What shape?

494
00:31:17,176 --> 00:31:18,578
Where you pee from...

495
00:31:18,678 --> 00:31:21,081
Idiot! Don't play with that!

496
00:31:21,178 --> 00:31:24,781
But... I only wiped it with toilet paper after going...

497
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,884
It started to change shape.

498
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,886
Idiot, who wipes that with paper?

499
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:33,180
Just swing it a couple of times and put it back in!

500
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,594
Don't do funny stuff to it!

501
00:31:35,694 --> 00:31:37,398
I got it.

502
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:42,601
But <i>you</i> have to use the paper.

503
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:44,104
Fine.

504
00:31:44,204 --> 00:31:46,907
Hey, how's it going at your end?

505
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,803
Ain't so bad, I guess.

506
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,408
You can't talk like that!

507
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,910
Anyway, what about you?

508
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,115
Everything going well?

509
00:31:54,311 --> 00:31:56,815
I cooked something, and we ate together, but...

510
00:31:56,915 --> 00:32:01,117
your mom seemed to be surprised at how fast I ate.

511
00:32:01,118 --> 00:32:01,919
Really...

512
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,923
You know how I have a big family.

513
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,416
If you don't eat quickly...

514
00:32:09,923 --> 00:32:11,816
There will be none left.

515
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,932
I know what you mean. It took a while to grab the food.

516
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,938
You have to eat properly

517
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,072
It's my body.

518
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:23,941
But I'm a bit relieved.

519
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:27,944
You're calm enough to cook.

520
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,949
I'll try to think of something about our situation.

521
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:34,051
- That and...
- Yes?

522
00:32:34,151 --> 00:32:36,354
Did you see a cell phone in my pocket?

523
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,955
There was.

524
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:41,659
But it's all wet, so the memory is all gone.

525
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,461
It doesn't matter.

526
00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:44,498
But the strap...

527
00:32:45,998 --> 00:32:48,966
Oh, this? The piano-shaped one?

528
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,402
Can you keep it somewhere safe?

529
00:32:50,502 --> 00:32:52,504
Is it a gift from someone important?

530
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,073
This Akemi person?

531
00:32:54,173 --> 00:32:57,576
No, it's from my pops.

532
00:32:57,676 --> 00:32:59,078
From your father?

533
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:01,880
Well then, I'm going to hang up.
Take care.

534
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,682
You too.

535
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:05,075
Bye.

536
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:11,691
What, again?

537
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,694
What, you still have something to say?

538
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:18,797
It's Kazumi... right?

539
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,998
Oh, ah... Yes.

540
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,434
It's me, Hiroshi.

541
00:33:23,435 --> 00:33:25,237
Oh, Hiroshi is that...

542
00:33:25,238 --> 00:33:28,907
class president, Kazumi's boyfriend, show-off, Yamamoto Hiroshi?

543
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,410
What's the matter? You're acting strange today, Kazumi.

544
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:34,011
I'm not acting strange, damn it.

545
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,414
(Girl Talk:) I mean... I'm not strange.

546
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,013
There's definitely something wrong.

547
00:33:37,014 --> 00:33:40,017
I called your cell phone many times, but it wouldn't connect, so I called your home.

548
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:43,020
Oh, my cell... It's in my home...

549
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,023
Huh?

550
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:46,825
(Girl talk:) It was soaked in water.

551
00:33:46,925 --> 00:33:49,928
Soaked?
- I went to the Spring of Sabishira.

552
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:53,030
You know, I took the transfer student, Kazuo there.

553
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,734
Then I fell in the water.

554
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:57,936
Really? I hope you're not hurt.

555
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,037
Duh, that's why I'm home.

556
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:03,040
Right... I don't mean to be rude,

557
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,944
but is this another one of your stories?

558
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,045
Huh, uh, um...

559
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,047
(Unnatural girl Talk:) This is truth it is.

560
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:13,050
(Girl Talk:) Kazuo is very strong.

561
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,054
(Girl Talk:) He saved me.

562
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,056
Something's definitely wrong.

563
00:34:18,057 --> 00:34:19,558
I'm coming over right now.

564
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:21,058
No, no, don't come!

565
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,260
- Please don't come!
- But...

566
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:25,062
Don't worry, I'm just tired.

567
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:28,065
Maybe that's why I'm a bit nervous.

568
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:31,168
So you don't need to come tonight.

569
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:33,170
I see...

570
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:35,175
Then... rest well.

571
00:34:36,175 --> 00:34:38,676
Do you think you can come to school tomorrow?

572
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:39,978
I think so.

573
00:34:39,979 --> 00:34:41,972
Bye, good night.

574
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,598
Who was it?

575
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,201
Such a long call.

576
00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:05,003
It was Hiroshi.

577
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:08,106
You've had a long day, go to sleep.

578
00:35:09,106 --> 00:35:12,109
Don't forget to greet grandma before going to sleep.

579
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,913
Ask her to heal your head.

580
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,115
Grandma's still alive?

581
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:20,018
What is she talking about?

582
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,111
That's a tough book.

583
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:27,816
Tie your sash properly!

584
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,131
This way, go.

585
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:37,324
Pray that you'll feel better tomorrow.

586
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:40,939
I'm sleeping here?!

587
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:44,042
What? You have your own room.

588
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:46,845
Now, give her a greeting.

589
00:35:48,145 --> 00:35:51,645
( Random chanting... )

590
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:57,055
Kazuo, are you asleep?

591
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:00,158
No, what is it?

592
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:04,195
I ironed your uniform.

593
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:06,064
Oh, thanks!

594
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:10,157
I'll also iron that weird Kazumi's uniform.

595
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:15,073
I found her cell phone too, but it's broken.

596
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,275
But return it tomorrow.

597
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:19,878
Who knows how that crazy girl will react?

598
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:23,282
Really, I can't believe she turned out to be such an annoying kid.

599
00:36:24,082 --> 00:36:26,075
Ah! Hot, hot, hot!

600
00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:00,819
Kazuo.

601
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,637
Oh, you're here?

602
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:09,158
Are you crazy? You can't wear that to school.

603
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,261
I've brought your uniform.

604
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:13,263
Your mom washed it for you.

605
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:16,935
Here's your precious cell phone strap,

606
00:37:17,035 --> 00:37:18,537
and my broken cell phone.

607
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:21,740
I can't get the buttons on!

608
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,843
What are you doing? Wear a bra underneath!

609
00:37:24,943 --> 00:37:26,445
People can see my breasts!

610
00:37:26,545 --> 00:37:27,547
Calm down.

611
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:30,147
Over there, in the top drawer.

612
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,847
What's that?
- Don't touch that!

613
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,355
Help me with this.

614
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,768
Good morning, Kazumi.

615
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,771
How are you feeling?

616
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:55,073
You? What are you doing?

617
00:37:55,173 --> 00:37:58,476
Mom, I always tell you to knock before entering my room!

618
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:01,079
What about you?

619
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:03,281
Entering a girl's room this early in the morning?

620
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:07,285
Uh, I came to bring his cell phone strap and uniform.

621
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:11,184
She came because she was worried I suddenly turned into a girl.

622
00:38:11,185 --> 00:38:12,687
You don't have to get all mad.

623
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,893
Who do you think you're talking to?

624
00:38:15,093 --> 00:38:17,697
And why aren't you wearing anything?

625
00:38:19,197 --> 00:38:22,200
What did you do that for, old lady?!
- Kazuo, stop!

626
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,303
What did you just call me?

627
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:28,304
Why are you here in my daughter's room?

628
00:38:28,305 --> 00:38:30,309
Do you think this is appropriate?

629
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,344
Honey!

630
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:35,915
This is inappropriate too!

631
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:41,119
What's going on?!

632
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:43,421
Your skirt is on backwards.

633
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:45,724
Oops.

634
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:51,630
Are the folks in your home going to be alright?

635
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:55,234
They're fine. It happens all the time.

636
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:57,037
Oh.

637
00:38:59,237 --> 00:39:02,941
You may be good at these things,

638
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:08,043
but I'm not used to living in an unrealistic situation like this.

639
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,350
What's wrong?

640
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:16,254
I'm starting to want to kill myself.

641
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,356
Whoa, don't be absurd!

642
00:39:18,357 --> 00:39:21,058
What will happen to me if you died?

643
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:24,063
Your body belongs to me.

644
00:39:24,563 --> 00:39:26,565
I know that.

645
00:39:27,265 --> 00:39:29,267
Good morning.

646
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,368
Let's just go to the school.

647
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:35,170
Good morning.

648
00:39:35,171 --> 00:39:36,572
(Girl Talk:) Let's go.

649
00:39:36,573 --> 00:39:37,574
(Girl Talk:) Yes.

650
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:39,276
(Boy Talk:) I mean, Yes.

651
00:39:39,277 --> 00:39:40,879
Is that correct?

652
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:43,079
Ah! I missed breakfast!

653
00:39:43,479 --> 00:39:44,883
I'm hungry.

654
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,793
- Kazumi and...
- Kazuo!

655
00:39:56,294 --> 00:39:58,296
All rise,

656
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,397
bow.

657
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,399
Good morning.

658
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,404
Morning!

659
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,104
Sit down.

660
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,406
For today's music lesson...

661
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,409
Let's enjoy...

662
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,013
a piano performance first!

663
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,406
Yay!

664
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,322
Saitou.

665
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,423
Yes.

666
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,426
Oh, I wasn't calling you, Kazumi.

667
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:32,230
It's Saitou Kazuo.

668
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,665
Saitou Kazuo actually happens to be

669
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:37,937
a great piano player from Onomichi.

670
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,441
Isn't that right?

671
00:40:42,741 --> 00:40:44,742
Don't be shy.

672
00:40:44,743 --> 00:40:48,736
Well then, Kazuo. Go ahead.

673
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,992
Come on, Kazuo.

674
00:41:01,092 --> 00:41:02,694
The piano is waiting for you.

675
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:07,787
Kazuo, you can do it!

676
00:41:13,405 --> 00:41:15,407
What's wrong, Kazuo?

677
00:41:15,507 --> 00:41:18,510
You're good at piano, right?

678
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:23,312
Come on, Kazuo. Like a hero from Kazumi's fairy tale...

679
00:41:23,482 --> 00:41:27,175
Play the piano like a prince!

680
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,488
(Boy Talk:) What are you doing?

681
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,893
Just spread your fingers, hit the keys and it'll make sound!

682
00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:39,097
Do-re-mi or Flea Waltz, or whatever, just play you idiot!

683
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,098
(Girl Talk:) How can you expect me

684
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:43,100
to actually play the piano all of a sudden?

685
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:44,803
This is all your fault

686
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:48,039
for learning piano without telling me.
Idiot!

687
00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:51,508
Oh, crap!

688
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,011
Kazuo!

689
00:41:53,111 --> 00:41:56,113
Time-out for a sec.
Kazumi, wait! Don't kill yourself!

690
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,723
Watch over the class.

691
00:42:04,323 --> 00:42:06,316
Quiet down.

692
00:42:15,634 --> 00:42:16,938
Hey...

693
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,031
Wait.

694
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,547
Hey, Kazumi.

695
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:31,549
What's the matter?

696
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:36,542
It's not fair. Piano is not a part of my fairy tale.

697
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,556
But Akemi taught me...

698
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,558
Hey there!

699
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,560
What's going on here?

700
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:46,563
Kazumi, I thought I heard you scream

701
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,565
"don't kill yourself"...

702
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,259
What's going on?

703
00:42:55,124 --> 00:42:56,373
Kazuo.

704
00:42:57,330 --> 00:43:00,576
It's not like a boy to be crying like that.

705
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:02,682
What exactly is the problem?

706
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:06,384
Hey, Kazuo.

707
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,586
Stop that.

708
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:10,166
Stop, you idiot!

709
00:43:13,246 --> 00:43:14,692
Oh, crap!

710
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:17,085
Are you alright, teacher?

711
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:29,397
What the hell? Move it!

712
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:35,412
Ow, move it.

713
00:43:36,514 --> 00:43:37,516
Don't look!

714
00:43:37,614 --> 00:43:39,015
Take your head out of my skirt!

715
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:40,618
It's all dark, I can't see anything.

716
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:42,620
But that was kind of hot.

717
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,723
Geez, that hurt.

718
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,624
Hiroshi?

719
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,618
Oh my god!

720
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:01,138
I'm glad it wasn't anything serious.

721
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:04,142
I don't know what I would do if it left scars.

722
00:44:04,542 --> 00:44:07,545
Hiroshi didn't even help, he was just staring.

723
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,682
Hiroshi likes watching doesn't he?

724
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:15,075
I want to get back into this body.

725
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:29,567
Cute boy and girl.

726
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:34,060
The short days of autumn are sad, aren't they?

727
00:44:36,574 --> 00:44:39,677
Young girl, you have a small frame,

728
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:43,281
but a nice proportion.

729
00:44:43,481 --> 00:44:47,774
Why don't you take my hand and come with me?

730
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,687
Someone,

731
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,690
someone help!

732
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:54,592
Why are you screaming?

733
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,693
I have nothing to do with you.

734
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,695
Go away!

735
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,697
Stop!

736
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:01,800
What are you doing?

737
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,003
What a creepy kid, go away!

738
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,405
Kazumi!

739
00:45:07,605 --> 00:45:10,198
You OK? Why you...

740
00:45:13,944 --> 00:45:15,447
Hurry, let's go.

741
00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:17,149
I can't breathe...

742
00:45:17,249 --> 00:45:19,442
Open your legs.
- It's too embarrassing.

743
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,993
Just do it!

744
00:45:24,622 --> 00:45:26,524
- Is that better?
- A bit...

745
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:29,127
Let's get away while he's still down.

746
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:31,620
Here's a bonus!

747
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:37,925
Autumn days... are painful...

748
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:49,644
Actually, Saitou and Saitou were...

749
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:53,750
about to engage in red entertainment...

750
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,752
Pinku entertainment, you mean.

751
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:59,156
Yes, pinku entertainment when...

752
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:05,249
the president of Educational Committee's grandson came to warn them...

753
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:09,955
One of the Saitou kicked his...

754
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:15,469
important place!

755
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:16,774
You fool!

756
00:46:16,775 --> 00:46:20,810
Anyway, my son's...

757
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:23,780
that place is internally bleeding.

758
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,983
He had to take a leave of absence from university too.

759
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:28,785
How will you take responsibility for this?

760
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,787
He's a university student?

761
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:34,190
Excuse me, my child is a girl.

762
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:37,694
There is no way a girl can do something like that to a big university student.

763
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:40,929
I'm sure Kazuo was the one who did it.

764
00:46:41,631 --> 00:46:43,700
Saitou? Did you do it?

765
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,802
Well...

766
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:48,305
Kazuo, tell me. What happened?

767
00:46:48,307 --> 00:46:51,808
That bastard was staring at me with a really dirty look!

768
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,611
If we didn't get him,

769
00:46:53,701 --> 00:46:56,704
he would've rubbed this whole body, took off my panties, and...

770
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,816
Kazumi! Stop it already!

771
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:00,618
But...

772
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:07,613
In any case, I believe Kazuo was simply trying 
to protect Kazumi from being assaulted.

773
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,427
And Mr. Committee,

774
00:47:09,527 --> 00:47:12,729
your grandson kicked Kazuo's nuts first.

775
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:14,832
Watch your language!

776
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:17,735
It's true! That's why we kicked him back.

777
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:20,137
I guess it's self-defense.

778
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:21,739
That's hard to believe...

779
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:23,741
President Imada.

780
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:26,843
Let's just say we've both suffered damage.

781
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:29,346
Our students may have been partially responsible, but

782
00:47:29,348 --> 00:47:32,851
if this gets out to the public, 
it will affect your grandson's future career.

783
00:47:32,951 --> 00:47:34,952
Of course it will!

784
00:47:34,953 --> 00:47:37,454
If the public found out a university student

785
00:47:37,455 --> 00:47:40,358
got beaten by a junior high girl... Right?

786
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,251
Thanks, mom.

787
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:47,756
That's not your mom.

788
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,877
They bought you a new cell phone?

789
00:47:59,977 --> 00:48:02,780
Yeah, your mom said I'm strange lately,

790
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,882
so she bought it for me so she can contact me anytime.

791
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:07,884
Oh, my mom said that?

792
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:10,387
Oh, crap! It's that kid Hiroshi!

793
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:11,390
Let me see!

794
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:14,891
"I called your home, and they told me you've got a new cell phone."

795
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,893
I'm really worried about your abnormal behavior

796
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:19,562
ever since Kazuo transferred to our school.

797
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,399
Is there anything I can do to help?

798
00:48:21,499 --> 00:48:24,802
"Or am I no longer needed by you?"

799
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,138
Hiroshi...

800
00:48:26,238 --> 00:48:29,208
I'll type it for you. What do you want to say?

801
00:48:29,308 --> 00:48:31,307
I'm sorry for making you worry.

802
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:33,910
It's not that I no longer need you.

803
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:37,914
No, in fact, I think I need you most by my side right now, star-mark.

804
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,416
But please give me a bit more time.

805
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:41,951
Please don't forget, star-mark,

806
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:45,945
you're the most important person to me, OK, 3 question marks.

807
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:54,932
Then, I want you to remember this, star-mark.

808
00:48:54,933 --> 00:48:57,934
I am always by your side.

809
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:59,936
I'll die just for you, star-mark.

810
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,341
OK?

811
00:49:03,041 --> 00:49:06,543
"I'll die just for you"?

812
00:49:06,544 --> 00:49:08,947
That line sounds like a big lie, huh?

813
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,640
Ow, what the hell?

814
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:23,961
"Thank you,"

815
00:49:23,962 --> 00:49:26,263
I think I will be able to tell you everything one day.

816
00:49:26,264 --> 00:49:29,765
Please look after me from a distance until then.

817
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:31,346
"Goodbye."

818
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:37,074
You have to be the one holding this cell phone.

819
00:49:37,174 --> 00:49:39,877
Oh, right.

820
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:43,579
I promise I'll contact you if he sends mail again.

821
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,774
Thanks.

822
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:57,894
<i>There is a petition to have Zenkouji shrine nominated as a World Heritage Site...</i>

823
00:49:57,895 --> 00:50:00,096
Why are you lying around like that?

824
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:02,098
You're acting like a boy!

825
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:07,501
Kazumi, you weren't like this until that boy transferred here.

826
00:50:07,606 --> 00:50:12,108
That's why, I want you to stop hanging around with Kazuo for a while.

827
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:14,110
What? But...

828
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:18,114
That's what we've decided.
I also discussed this with Kazuo's mom.

829
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:22,118
She told me you were wandering around their home naked.

830
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:24,421
Turn off the TV when you're not watching.

831
00:50:24,422 --> 00:50:25,923
But that was because I fell in the water...

832
00:50:25,924 --> 00:50:30,828
In any case, you two are bad influences on each other.

833
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:34,131
Listen, I know you can't help it inside the school,

834
00:50:34,132 --> 00:50:37,831
but once you get out of the school, you're forbidden to hang around Kazuo.

835
00:50:37,832 --> 00:50:39,032
Forbidden.

836
00:50:39,136 --> 00:50:43,071
You, give her an earful as a father too!

837
00:50:44,076 --> 00:50:47,077
What do you say, Kazumi?
Want to make some soba again?

838
00:50:47,078 --> 00:50:47,777
Honey?

839
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:49,978
Soba? Kazumi can make soba?

840
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:53,082
It's true making soba is a man's job,

841
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:56,085
but I'm an incompetent apprentice of your grandfather's.

842
00:50:56,086 --> 00:51:00,090
He always teases me that you're better at making soba than me.

843
00:51:00,091 --> 00:51:03,093
I guess it's what they call "the talent skipped a generation"

844
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:06,096
But I like the soba you make.

845
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:10,000
Thank you, you're the only person who tells me that.

846
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,101
What do you say, Kazumi?

847
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:13,604
Want to give it a try?

848
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:16,607
OK, it's same as udon, right?

849
00:51:16,707 --> 00:51:18,700
Yeah... huh?

850
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:27,081
Oh, Kazumi. Want to give it a try?

851
00:51:27,082 --> 00:51:28,082
Yes.

852
00:51:30,788 --> 00:51:32,381
Raise your arms.

853
00:51:38,896 --> 00:51:40,389
You're good to go.

854
00:51:51,809 --> 00:51:54,211
It's same as udon, just as I thought.

855
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:56,304
- Here you go.
- Got it.

856
00:52:09,727 --> 00:52:12,530
Ka... Kazumi?! What are you doing?!

857
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,132
What's wrong?

858
00:52:15,232 --> 00:52:16,934
Huh? Am I doing it wrong?

859
00:52:17,034 --> 00:52:18,937
Auntie, you look awesome!

860
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:22,138
Dad, dad?

861
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:24,141
- Are you alright?
- No...

862
00:52:41,357 --> 00:52:43,961
Is this all my fault?

863
00:52:45,361 --> 00:52:47,363
Why is the restaurant closed?

864
00:52:47,463 --> 00:52:49,065
Welcome.

865
00:52:49,165 --> 00:52:51,166
What's wrong with you, Kazumi?

866
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:52,167
I'm not a customer.

867
00:52:52,168 --> 00:52:54,169
Welcome home, dad!

868
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:56,171
This is for you. - "Dad"?

869
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:58,075
You're Kazumi's older brother?

870
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:01,176
Mom told me you're acting strange lately, so I came to see how you're doing.

871
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:03,179
It seems she was right.

872
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,781
Are you practicing for the school play?

873
00:53:04,782 --> 00:53:08,785
Kouichi, Kouichi! She made soba with her feet!

874
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,302
With her feet?!

875
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:11,689
Is that true, Kazumi?

876
00:53:11,787 --> 00:53:13,689
Well, that's what we do for udon.

877
00:53:13,789 --> 00:53:17,082
That's why her dad and grandpa both fell into a state of shock.

878
00:53:18,907 --> 00:53:20,926
I see...

879
00:53:21,181 --> 00:53:23,786
But I guess you're trying to make soba your way.

880
00:53:23,886 --> 00:53:24,889
Huh?

881
00:53:24,989 --> 00:53:26,694
That's a great thing.

882
00:53:26,794 --> 00:53:30,433
I wasn't interested in making soba,
so I ran off to Tokyo, but

883
00:53:30,434 --> 00:53:32,437
it seems you like making soba.

884
00:53:32,438 --> 00:53:35,444
You might even become a pioneer of female soba masters.

885
00:53:35,445 --> 00:53:40,419
To achieve your goal... do whatever you need to, even with your feet!

886
00:53:41,323 --> 00:53:43,227
You have my support.
- Kouichi...

887
00:53:43,327 --> 00:53:44,330
Honey!

888
00:53:44,428 --> 00:53:45,231
OK.

889
00:53:45,431 --> 00:53:48,137
You're pretty understanding, bro!

890
00:53:48,237 --> 00:53:49,741
Understanding!

891
00:53:49,941 --> 00:53:52,445
Well then, I still have homework to do.

892
00:53:52,446 --> 00:53:54,449
I'm going back to my room.

893
00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:56,254
Kazumi, wait.

894
00:53:56,354 --> 00:53:58,358
Help me clean the restaurant.

895
00:53:58,458 --> 00:53:59,863
I'll help out too.

896
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,365
Me too!

897
00:54:09,381 --> 00:54:11,419
Kazumi, are you alright?

898
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,326
Yeah, I just felt a bit dizzy.

899
00:54:14,426 --> 00:54:15,497
Don't worry.

900
00:54:15,527 --> 00:54:18,000
It should still be a while until your next period.

901
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:21,440
Period? I'm going to have periods?

902
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:23,444
Of course you will.

903
00:54:23,545 --> 00:54:27,542
Give me a time-out. I'll go downstairs in a while.

904
00:54:33,665 --> 00:54:36,037
See? She's acting strangely.

905
00:54:36,137 --> 00:54:37,541
You might be right.

906
00:54:37,639 --> 00:54:39,042
Strange.

907
00:54:43,352 --> 00:54:45,455
Do you see a pretty pouch in the drawer?

908
00:54:45,456 --> 00:54:47,594
My sanitary pads are inside.

909
00:54:47,695 --> 00:54:49,564
What am I going to do?

910
00:54:49,565 --> 00:54:53,873
Your mom tells me I can't see you anymore.

911
00:54:53,973 --> 00:54:56,178
Your mother told me the same thing.

912
00:54:56,278 --> 00:54:58,382
Don't panic during your period.

913
00:54:58,484 --> 00:55:00,389
It only happens once a month.

914
00:55:00,486 --> 00:55:02,791
Oh, right. Our field trip is coming up.

915
00:55:02,792 --> 00:55:04,430
I'll show you how to use them then.

916
00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:06,300
Field trip?

917
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,205
Oh, it's your first time.

918
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:12,110
It's our school's annual event.
The entire class stays overnight somewhere.

919
00:55:12,111 --> 00:55:14,015
This year it's at Shimao Hot Spring.

920
00:55:14,115 --> 00:55:16,519
I don't care where we're going anymore.

921
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:18,824
I feel so tired tonight.

922
00:55:18,825 --> 00:55:20,530
As if I'm sick.

923
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:23,135
You're just not used to it.
It's not a sickness.

924
00:55:23,235 --> 00:55:28,242
Well, at least now the over-energetic Saitou Kazumi can finally calm down for a bit.

925
00:55:28,246 --> 00:55:30,250
I guess it worked out for the best.

926
00:55:30,351 --> 00:55:33,357
Hello? Hello?

927
00:55:33,457 --> 00:55:34,961
Are you listening to me, Kazuo?

928
00:55:35,259 --> 00:55:39,566
Yeah, I'm listening. I really don't feel very good.

929
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:42,675
I'm going to hang up now, good night.

930
00:55:42,875 --> 00:55:44,870
Oh, good night..

931
00:55:52,294 --> 00:55:53,998
Kazuo, can I come in?

932
00:55:54,098 --> 00:55:54,999
Yes.

933
00:55:55,099 --> 00:55:58,105
I see swimsuit in the list of things to bring for the field trip...

934
00:55:58,106 --> 00:56:00,011
You're actually going to swim in this weather?

935
00:56:00,111 --> 00:56:02,616
Oh, we wear it for the hot spring.

936
00:56:02,716 --> 00:56:04,621
Swimsuit for the hot spring?

937
00:56:04,721 --> 00:56:08,026
Yes, that's what we've always done in our school.

938
00:56:08,126 --> 00:56:09,631
"What we've always done"?

939
00:56:09,731 --> 00:56:12,637
Uh, that's what I heard from my friends.

940
00:56:12,737 --> 00:56:16,543
Oh. I've heard kids nowadays aren't used to shared baths,

941
00:56:16,544 --> 00:56:18,950
so they wear swimsuits for hot springs.

942
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:21,355
You used to share baths naked?

943
00:56:21,455 --> 00:56:24,661
Oh, I almost forgot. We have to buy you a new swimsuit.

944
00:56:24,763 --> 00:56:27,666
The old one was getting a bit small, right?

945
00:56:27,766 --> 00:56:29,261
Uh... I think so.

946
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:45,806
Saitou, what do you think of the mountains in Shinshuu?

947
00:56:45,906 --> 00:56:48,912
It's your first time, right? Aren't they beautiful?

948
00:56:49,012 --> 00:56:50,252
Yes.

949
00:56:52,754 --> 00:56:56,026
Saitou? What's wrong?

950
00:56:56,027 --> 00:56:57,765
You don't seem as energetic as usual.

951
00:56:57,865 --> 00:57:01,036
She's fine. Kazumi is a quiet girl, isn't she?

952
00:57:01,136 --> 00:57:03,143
You think?

953
00:57:04,044 --> 00:57:06,049
Are you alright, Saitou?

954
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:10,356
I think this is the first time I've seen you get car sick.

955
00:57:10,456 --> 00:57:11,760
I'm having my period.

956
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:13,061
Idiot!

957
00:57:13,662 --> 00:57:15,664
Kazuo!

958
00:57:23,384 --> 00:57:25,389
I got mine on! Let's go!

959
00:57:25,689 --> 00:57:28,695
Can you help me with mine?
- Sure.

960
00:57:29,596 --> 00:57:32,592
Yuuka, have your breasts gotten bigger again?

961
00:57:40,117 --> 00:57:42,123
Kazumi, are you alright?

962
00:57:43,124 --> 00:57:46,721
Gently tap her behind her neck.

963
00:57:54,948 --> 00:57:55,951
Saitou,

964
00:57:55,952 --> 00:57:58,256
Maybe you should rest up in your room.

965
00:57:58,356 --> 00:58:00,761
No, I'm fine.

966
00:58:00,961 --> 00:58:03,967
Ah... but maybe I should.

967
00:58:03,968 --> 00:58:07,975
Girls at your age have delicate bodies.

968
00:58:08,177 --> 00:58:10,773
Right, yes.

969
00:58:16,995 --> 00:58:20,001
Hey? Kazumi?

970
00:58:20,102 --> 00:58:22,106
You can play piano?

971
00:58:22,206 --> 00:58:23,210
Uh... no.

972
00:58:23,307 --> 00:58:25,712
I can tell from your finger's movements.

973
00:58:25,713 --> 00:58:29,310
But.. why have you never told me?

974
00:58:31,026 --> 00:58:35,033
It's a secret, but I used to play piano too.

975
00:58:35,133 --> 00:58:36,937
Used to?

976
00:58:37,037 --> 00:58:39,240
Because I quit.

977
00:58:39,241 --> 00:58:41,045
How come?

978
00:58:41,145 --> 00:58:44,152
Because I broke up with the person who loved piano.

979
00:58:44,252 --> 00:58:46,958
- For such a reason?
- It's fine!

980
00:58:47,058 --> 00:58:49,863
Learning and quitting piano...

981
00:58:49,864 --> 00:58:52,068
is all for the person you love.

982
00:58:52,168 --> 00:58:54,974
What kind of tunes did you like?

983
00:58:55,578 --> 00:58:59,072
Schumann's Novelletten.

984
00:59:06,096 --> 00:59:09,103
Oh, mom bought you a new pair of swim pants, huh?

985
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:11,007
Perv!

986
00:59:11,108 --> 00:59:14,113
You must have gotten the nosebleed from
watching girls change and got too excited.

987
00:59:14,213 --> 00:59:16,018
Well, it's a gold mine!

988
00:59:16,218 --> 00:59:18,022
Geez!

989
00:59:18,122 --> 00:59:19,061
Ow!

990
00:59:19,123 --> 00:59:21,163
What an overreaction!

991
00:59:22,765 --> 00:59:26,162
- What's wrong?
- It's nothing.

992
00:59:28,043 --> 00:59:30,047
What are you doing? Perv!

993
00:59:30,147 --> 00:59:32,152
Kazuo?

994
00:59:34,357 --> 00:59:38,365
I'll carry her, you get the teacher.

995
00:59:40,167 --> 00:59:43,172
Hang on, help is coming.

996
00:59:43,275 --> 00:59:46,282
Hiroshi... you're making me blush.

997
00:59:48,184 --> 00:59:50,187
She's fine now.

998
00:59:50,188 --> 00:59:52,392
Her complexion has improved a lot too.

999
00:59:52,393 --> 00:59:54,196
I'll stay by her.

1000
00:59:54,197 --> 00:59:56,200
All of you, return to your rooms.

1001
00:59:56,201 --> 00:59:58,205
It's better to give her some quiet time.

1002
00:59:58,606 --> 00:59:59,609
OK.

1003
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:02,114
Let's go.

1004
01:00:02,214 --> 01:00:04,218
Hang in there!

1005
01:00:04,318 --> 01:00:06,323
Dinner's at 6PM.

1006
01:00:07,424 --> 01:00:09,429
Take care.

1007
01:00:11,432 --> 01:00:12,436
Bye.

1008
01:00:14,138 --> 01:00:16,934
Saitou,
I need to talk to you.

1009
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:21,845
Uh, OK.

1010
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:27,134
It's almost dinner time.

1011
01:00:30,571 --> 01:00:32,177
Kazumi.

1012
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:34,294
Yes?

1013
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:37,988
Oh, uh...

1014
01:00:38,089 --> 01:00:40,193
I know that you're Kazumi.

1015
01:00:40,393 --> 01:00:42,198
Isn't that right?

1016
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:48,007
You and Saitou Kazuo switched bodies somehow.

1017
01:00:49,010 --> 01:00:53,719
That's the only explanation I can think of,
 by observing you two.

1018
01:00:54,021 --> 01:00:56,627
But... how did you know?

1019
01:00:57,027 --> 01:00:59,634
It's love.

1020
01:01:00,835 --> 01:01:02,440
Love?

1021
01:01:03,441 --> 01:01:05,045
Love is philosophy.

1022
01:01:05,145 --> 01:01:09,697
Even if it cannot be scientifically explained,
it can be by the philosophy of love.

1023
01:01:09,943 --> 01:01:10,956
Hiroshi...

1024
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:13,554
 The person I love is...

1025
01:01:14,613 --> 01:01:18,020
You, Kazumi.

1026
01:01:18,377 --> 01:01:19,582
Me?

1027
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,179
Me, inside me?

1028
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:23,883
I can't stop loving you.

1029
01:01:23,884 --> 01:01:27,892
And even if the Kazumi I love is shaped like a man,

1030
01:01:27,893 --> 01:01:30,934
I can accept that.

1031
01:01:31,835 --> 01:01:34,807
Because I love your soul.

1032
01:01:35,506 --> 01:01:37,011
Hiroshi.

1033
01:01:37,111 --> 01:01:40,108
Kazumi, Kazumi.

1034
01:02:13,036 --> 01:02:16,032
<i>Suddenly...</i>

1035
01:02:35,132 --> 01:02:38,129
<i>I can't see you anymore</i>

1036
01:02:44,584 --> 01:02:47,580
<i>Starting tomorrow</i>

1037
01:02:49,990 --> 01:02:54,688
<i>I won't be able to see you again</i>

1038
01:03:00,601 --> 01:03:04,298
<i>I won't be able to</i>

1039
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:09,959
<i>See you again</i>

1040
01:03:10,619 --> 01:03:15,116
<i>Even if I prayed for it</i>

1041
01:03:25,690 --> 01:03:26,727
What's the matter?

1042
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:28,976
I would've even understood it if you said

1043
01:03:28,977 --> 01:03:32,785
"Your forehead is cute" or
"I like the shape of your jaw."

1044
01:03:32,853 --> 01:03:36,850
But how can you possibly see my soul?

1045
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:50,586
You're in love with your own soul.

1046
01:03:50,688 --> 01:03:53,695
Not mine, not Kazumi's.

1047
01:03:53,397 --> 01:03:56,994
Even if it was, it's the ideal me in your mind.

1048
01:04:04,618 --> 01:04:07,324
That's not the real me.

1049
01:04:07,424 --> 01:04:09,419
Not this Kazumi.

1050
01:04:17,774 --> 01:04:21,070
I'm not philosophical like you.

1051
01:04:22,751 --> 01:04:27,757
<i>You will become a wind</i>

1052
01:04:28,758 --> 01:04:34,965
<i>Become an invisible wind</i>

1053
01:04:36,566 --> 01:04:42,573
<i>To your most sought after place</i>

1054
01:04:43,073 --> 01:04:49,881
<i>You will become a wind and reach</i>

1055
01:04:51,582 --> 01:04:57,589
<i>Don't laugh and say I'm strange</i>

1056
01:04:58,590 --> 01:05:04,596
<i>It's slightly embarrassing</i>

1057
01:05:05,821 --> 01:05:13,821
<i>You can see through everything</i>

1058
01:05:17,010 --> 01:05:20,013
<i>That's why</i>

1059
01:05:21,114 --> 01:05:29,114
<i>I'm leaving you now...</i>

1060
01:05:31,198 --> 01:05:33,201
Kaneko, Kawahara,

1061
01:05:33,202 --> 01:05:34,605
Kita,

1062
01:05:34,705 --> 01:05:36,107
Kuroda,

1063
01:05:36,209 --> 01:05:37,210
Kobayashi,

1064
01:05:37,211 --> 01:05:40,918
Saitou, Saitou Kazumi?

1065
01:05:40,930 --> 01:05:41,734
Yes.

1066
01:05:41,739 --> 01:05:43,143
Not you.

1067
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:47,120
Saitou Kazumi is... absent.

1068
01:05:48,534 --> 01:05:50,539
Sakui,

1069
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:53,044
Sawada,

1070
01:05:53,244 --> 01:05:55,239
Shiina...

1071
01:05:59,156 --> 01:06:01,160
Kazumi is sleeping.

1072
01:06:01,261 --> 01:06:04,267
She's acting strange, more than usual!

1073
01:06:04,367 --> 01:06:08,407
I can't let you see her even if you come all this way to visit.

1074
01:06:08,676 --> 01:06:10,781
So, please. Leave.

1075
01:06:11,381 --> 01:06:14,378
Let's go, Kazuko.

1076
01:06:21,301 --> 01:06:22,807
Kazumi.

1077
01:06:24,909 --> 01:06:26,414
Hiroshi.

1078
01:06:27,615 --> 01:06:30,320
My mom won't let me see Kazuo.

1079
01:06:30,321 --> 01:06:33,626
I've never had to sleep in because of my period.

1080
01:06:33,627 --> 01:06:37,435
I'm really worried about what's happening to my body.

1081
01:06:37,732 --> 01:06:39,136
OK.

1082
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,343
I'll go visit.

1083
01:06:41,344 --> 01:06:44,250
I promised to do anything for you.

1084
01:06:44,350 --> 01:06:46,353
Please do that for me.

1085
01:06:46,354 --> 01:06:49,662
I'm sure my mom will let you see me.
- Yes.

1086
01:06:50,563 --> 01:06:52,567
Sorry for making you worry.

1087
01:06:52,667 --> 01:06:56,301
I'm fine, 
but Kazumi is worried about your body.

1088
01:06:56,302 --> 01:06:57,869
Kazumi is...

1089
01:06:58,016 --> 01:07:01,385
Does that mean Kazumi told you?

1090
01:07:01,386 --> 01:07:02,417
No.

1091
01:07:02,990 --> 01:07:05,167
Kazumi's stories are always very imaginative,

1092
01:07:05,231 --> 01:07:09,001
and although they were amusing, 
I've always thought them to be slightly immature.

1093
01:07:09,002 --> 01:07:10,505
But I noticed...

1094
01:07:10,506 --> 01:07:12,910
That song you sang most recently...

1095
01:07:13,010 --> 01:07:15,014
The song...

1096
01:07:15,015 --> 01:07:18,022
It came naturally to me.

1097
01:07:18,867 --> 01:07:22,674
That song was like one of Kazumi's stories.

1098
01:07:22,675 --> 01:07:24,479
It sounded as if Kazumi had made it.

1099
01:07:24,635 --> 01:07:26,136
You may be right

1100
01:07:26,137 --> 01:07:31,045
It felt as if I was her when I was singing it.

1101
01:07:31,749 --> 01:07:35,755
Hiroshi, thank you for visiting.

1102
01:07:36,058 --> 01:07:38,754
Please keep her company.

1103
01:07:41,971 --> 01:07:44,477
Come on, talk about something.

1104
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:48,083
Would you like some snacks?

1105
01:07:48,183 --> 01:07:50,379
Yes, thank you.

1106
01:08:00,141 --> 01:08:02,747
It reminds me of the time when my dad used to hold me.

1107
01:08:03,448 --> 01:08:06,154
We're not equipped to treat her here.

1108
01:08:06,155 --> 01:08:08,158
I will recommend you to a hospital in Nagano.

1109
01:08:08,159 --> 01:08:11,667
Please consult with an expert from there.

1110
01:08:11,767 --> 01:08:15,764
It's such a difficult disease to treat?
- Yes...

1111
01:08:18,346 --> 01:08:22,052
I will arrange a full medical examination in 2 or 3 days.

1112
01:08:22,154 --> 01:08:24,158
Please be prepared to stay in the hospital.

1113
01:08:24,258 --> 01:08:25,252
OK.

1114
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:47,205
She has a very rare illness.

1115
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:49,912
We have also never encountered it before in our hospital.

1116
01:08:50,012 --> 01:08:51,815
And the treatment?

1117
01:08:51,816 --> 01:08:55,012
You can cure it, right?
- About that...

1118
01:08:57,527 --> 01:09:03,037
Director, they are the parents of the patient.

1119
01:09:03,239 --> 01:09:05,945
Oh, you're that...

1120
01:09:06,045 --> 01:09:09,352
Committee president! 
You're a doctor in this hospital?

1121
01:09:09,452 --> 01:09:11,155
Yes...

1122
01:09:11,172 --> 01:09:14,178
Does that mean, that lively girl...

1123
01:09:14,883 --> 01:09:17,870
Doctor, you can cure Kazumi's illness, right?

1124
01:09:17,995 --> 01:09:20,200
Dr. Mizutani, you still haven't...?

1125
01:09:20,275 --> 01:09:21,279
No.

1126
01:09:23,281 --> 01:09:29,026
Sir, with the current medical technology,
 you're daughter's illness can't...

1127
01:09:29,027 --> 01:09:32,310
What? 
It can't be cured?

1128
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:33,302
But...

1129
01:09:33,303 --> 01:09:36,208
Are you just saying that because of our history?

1130
01:09:36,308 --> 01:09:39,313
You're just saying that to scare us, right?

1131
01:09:39,314 --> 01:09:42,319
It's nothing more than a light anemia,

1132
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:46,328
and you're trying to make her suffer.

1133
01:09:46,329 --> 01:09:48,662
Isn't that right?

1134
01:09:48,667 --> 01:09:52,340
Madam, 
I'm a doctor.

1135
01:09:52,341 --> 01:09:57,248
I would never lie or joke to a patient's family!

1136
01:09:57,545 --> 01:09:59,853
But...

1137
01:10:00,458 --> 01:10:03,955
But she's still only 15!

1138
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:08,373
Honey...

1139
01:10:08,374 --> 01:10:10,878
she's only 15...

1140
01:10:10,879 --> 01:10:12,874
15...

1141
01:10:16,391 --> 01:10:18,394
Doctor,

1142
01:10:18,395 --> 01:10:21,401
how long...

1143
01:10:21,402 --> 01:10:24,007
How long does Kazumi have?

1144
01:10:24,408 --> 01:10:27,413
I cannot guarantee it,

1145
01:10:27,414 --> 01:10:29,318
but most likely...

1146
01:10:30,033 --> 01:10:32,715
2 to 3 months.

1147
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:38,736
That... 
that can't be...

1148
01:10:39,473 --> 01:10:42,680
We will do all we can.

1149
01:10:43,381 --> 01:10:48,356
 But the support of family and friends 
will be more reassuring than anything else.

1150
01:10:48,758 --> 01:10:50,461
I know it must be tough,

1151
01:10:50,462 --> 01:10:52,457
but let's give it our best.

1152
01:10:55,172 --> 01:10:57,376
- Hi.
- Committee president?

1153
01:10:57,476 --> 01:11:01,484
Thanks to you giving my grandson a beating,

1154
01:11:01,485 --> 01:11:04,489
we found out more and more of his wrongdoings.

1155
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:06,494
He had been skipping university,

1156
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:09,401
and hanging around with trouble-making friends of his.

1157
01:11:09,501 --> 01:11:12,509
See, told you it was that punk's fault.

1158
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:15,415
You're right!

1159
01:11:15,715 --> 01:11:20,522
That severe injury turned out to be a good lesson for him!

1160
01:11:20,624 --> 01:11:22,428
I think he's learnt his lesson.

1161
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:24,532
It's all thanks to you.

1162
01:11:24,533 --> 01:11:28,540
So I am indebted to you.

1163
01:11:28,541 --> 01:11:31,447
I'll do my best in your treatment.

1164
01:11:31,547 --> 01:11:35,444
You're going to grab my boobs 
and say it's an examination, aren't you?

1165
01:11:36,658 --> 01:11:38,462
You got me!

1166
01:11:38,562 --> 01:11:41,167
Well, I might have to touch a little.

1167
01:11:41,168 --> 01:11:44,673
Anyway, can you do something about this kindergarten-like room?

1168
01:11:44,773 --> 01:11:47,479
It's bringing back the memory of getting my wee-wee pulled.

1169
01:11:47,581 --> 01:11:50,422
Oops, she already took mine.

1170
01:11:51,723 --> 01:11:54,594
Patients 15 and under are considered pediatrics...

1171
01:11:54,595 --> 01:11:56,598
But I'll move you to an adult's room.

1172
01:11:56,599 --> 01:11:59,604
OK. Fine, I'll let you touch my boobs.

1173
01:11:59,605 --> 01:12:01,609
It seems like you're a nice person.

1174
01:12:01,610 --> 01:12:03,613
Well, thank you.

1175
01:12:03,614 --> 01:12:06,619
Let's try to get along.

1176
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:08,623
Let's give it our best.

1177
01:12:08,624 --> 01:12:09,919
OK.

1178
01:12:14,637 --> 01:12:17,642
It can't be cured?
Does that mean I'm going to die?

1179
01:12:17,643 --> 01:12:21,149
Kazumi's body will die... 
What about Kazuo?

1180
01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:23,416
What will happen to Kazuo?

1181
01:12:23,456 --> 01:12:25,459
Kazumi's body will die,

1182
01:12:25,659 --> 01:12:28,665
that means Kazuo inside will also die.

1183
01:12:28,666 --> 01:12:30,604
That's the most logical conclusion.

1184
01:12:30,704 --> 01:12:33,431
I can't live on if Kazuo dies.

1185
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:34,634
What should I do,

1186
01:12:34,798 --> 01:12:36,293
What should I do?

1187
01:12:40,368 --> 01:12:41,862
Keep still.

1188
01:12:53,352 --> 01:12:56,348
Here, it's from Kazuko to "auntie".

1189
01:13:00,732 --> 01:13:03,028
Sorry to trouble you, Hiroshi.

1190
01:13:06,945 --> 01:13:08,551
Dr. Mizutani.

1191
01:13:10,253 --> 01:13:12,257
Who's that boy?

1192
01:13:12,357 --> 01:13:16,365
Oh, he stares at Saitou's room from there every day,

1193
01:13:16,366 --> 01:13:18,369
but it seems he caused some trouble in the past.

1194
01:13:18,370 --> 01:13:20,674
Her family members won't give him permission to visit.

1195
01:13:20,774 --> 01:13:22,069
Hold this.

1196
01:13:34,503 --> 01:13:39,011
You're Saitou, right?

1197
01:13:40,015 --> 01:13:41,510
Yes.

1198
01:13:45,826 --> 01:13:47,330
Why are you here.

1199
01:13:47,691 --> 01:13:49,434
You can't see her.

1200
01:13:49,534 --> 01:13:53,040
Madam, if you're avoiding him because of that incident,

1201
01:13:53,042 --> 01:13:54,945
I'll apologize on his behalf.

1202
01:13:54,946 --> 01:13:56,650
I want him to talk to Kazumi.

1203
01:13:56,750 --> 01:13:58,854
I can't allow that.

1204
01:13:58,955 --> 01:14:02,360
Chie, let him visit.

1205
01:14:02,462 --> 01:14:04,366
But honey...

1206
01:14:04,466 --> 01:14:09,073
Doesn't Kazumi need the support of as many friends as possible?

1207
01:14:09,276 --> 01:14:11,280
Let him visit her.

1208
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:15,377
Will you see Kazumi for us?

1209
01:14:24,707 --> 01:14:26,302
Kazuo?

1210
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:31,925
It's me.

1211
01:14:32,021 --> 01:14:33,527
Come on, now.

1212
01:14:34,428 --> 01:14:37,135
Oh, right. 
It's Kazumi.

1213
01:14:37,735 --> 01:14:40,441
My mind is dull.

1214
01:14:40,842 --> 01:14:42,846
It's the medicine's side effect.

1215
01:14:43,046 --> 01:14:45,050
What exactly happened?

1216
01:14:45,451 --> 01:14:47,455
I don't know.

1217
01:14:47,555 --> 01:14:51,561
It just turned out this way.

1218
01:14:52,565 --> 01:14:54,069
Forgive me.

1219
01:14:54,169 --> 01:14:56,473
How did this happen,

1220
01:14:56,474 --> 01:14:57,877
Kazuo?

1221
01:14:58,578 --> 01:15:00,582
I don't know.

1222
01:15:00,583 --> 01:15:06,792
It feels like I was suddenly thrown into a whole different world.

1223
01:15:07,198 --> 01:15:11,204
Kazuo, is there anything I can do for you?

1224
01:15:11,205 --> 01:15:14,812
You're me, so I'll do anything for you.

1225
01:15:15,613 --> 01:15:17,617
Tell me if you need anything.

1226
01:15:17,717 --> 01:15:19,420
Don't push yourself too hard.

1227
01:15:19,421 --> 01:15:21,526
- I'm fine.
- But...

1228
01:15:21,626 --> 01:15:23,730
that's my body.

1229
01:15:23,731 --> 01:15:27,138
I should be the one lying down there.

1230
01:15:27,338 --> 01:15:29,743
Why are you sick instead?

1231
01:15:29,796 --> 01:15:31,801
It can't be helped.

1232
01:15:31,948 --> 01:15:34,152
We've switched.

1233
01:15:34,653 --> 01:15:37,658
I'm you right now.

1234
01:15:37,659 --> 01:15:39,663
I'm the one who got sick.

1235
01:15:39,763 --> 01:15:41,567
But...

1236
01:15:41,667 --> 01:15:45,975
Do you remember that kid Hiroshi saying that corny line?

1237
01:15:46,578 --> 01:15:49,785
"I'll die just for you".

1238
01:15:50,686 --> 01:15:52,981
What a joke.

1239
01:15:54,795 --> 01:15:58,003
But I guess he's a nice guy.

1240
01:15:59,705 --> 01:16:03,502
"I'll die just for you", huh?

1241
01:16:04,916 --> 01:16:06,921
I'm sorry.

1242
01:16:07,421 --> 01:16:09,426
I'm sorry, Kazuo.

1243
01:16:10,527 --> 01:16:12,532
Why are you apologizing?

1244
01:16:12,732 --> 01:16:15,537
Is there anything you want,

1245
01:16:15,538 --> 01:16:17,777
or person you want to see?

1246
01:16:18,678 --> 01:16:20,681
Person I want to see?

1247
01:16:20,682 --> 01:16:21,952
Of course it's...

1248
01:16:22,052 --> 01:16:24,057
I know...

1249
01:16:25,559 --> 01:16:27,563
Of course.

1250
01:16:27,763 --> 01:16:30,359
You want to see your mom.

1251
01:16:32,774 --> 01:16:35,479
I thought I said you're not allowed to see Kazumi.

1252
01:16:35,579 --> 01:16:37,684
But she really wants to see you.

1253
01:16:37,784 --> 01:16:39,787
Why does she want to see me?

1254
01:16:39,788 --> 01:16:41,791
She said because you took care of her...

1255
01:16:41,792 --> 01:16:43,796
I never took care of her.

1256
01:16:43,797 --> 01:16:47,404
I don't see a reason for me to see Kazumi either.

1257
01:16:47,504 --> 01:16:49,909
You just want to use me to see her, 
isn't that right?

1258
01:16:50,009 --> 01:16:52,515
That's not fair, mom!

1259
01:16:52,815 --> 01:16:55,821
That's 378 yen. Thank you.

1260
01:16:56,021 --> 01:16:57,924
Anyway, Kazuo.

1261
01:16:57,925 --> 01:16:59,528
I got a phone call from Akemi.

1262
01:16:59,529 --> 01:17:02,535
She's coming here to visit you in the winter break.

1263
01:17:02,736 --> 01:17:04,139
Akemi's coming?

1264
01:17:04,239 --> 01:17:05,643
I know you want to see her.

1265
01:17:05,743 --> 01:17:09,151
You'll completely forget about Kazumi once she's here.

1266
01:17:09,851 --> 01:17:11,856
Do you know how I can contact her?

1267
01:17:11,956 --> 01:17:16,362
What? Have you forgotten 
how to contact your own girlfriend?

1268
01:17:16,866 --> 01:17:19,562
Yeah... 
my old cell phone got soaked in water.

1269
01:17:37,708 --> 01:17:38,609
Kazuo!

1270
01:17:38,709 --> 01:17:41,105
Are you Yoshino Akemi?

1271
01:17:49,633 --> 01:17:52,639
Oh, you really are Kazuo.

1272
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:55,344
Well, I guess it's Kazuo's body.

1273
01:17:55,345 --> 01:17:56,849
So that's not a surprise.

1274
01:17:56,949 --> 01:18:00,355
So, you understood what I explained in the email?

1275
01:18:00,455 --> 01:18:01,958
Vaguely,

1276
01:18:01,959 --> 01:18:03,962
but it's obvious when I see you in person.

1277
01:18:03,963 --> 01:18:05,901
You're not Kazuo.

1278
01:18:06,001 --> 01:18:08,873
I see, 
you can also tell.

1279
01:18:08,975 --> 01:18:12,080
Nice to meet you,
I'm Saitou Kazumi.

1280
01:18:12,181 --> 01:18:14,785
He's Yamamoto Hiroshi from my class.

1281
01:18:14,986 --> 01:18:17,793
Nice to meet you, 
I'm Yamamoto Hiroshi.

1282
01:18:18,894 --> 01:18:21,900
Ah, so you're my rival in love.

1283
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,404
I guess so.

1284
01:18:23,504 --> 01:18:29,113
I cried for a whole night after you told me Kazuo might die.

1285
01:18:29,215 --> 01:18:31,018
I kept crying,

1286
01:18:31,019 --> 01:18:35,026
and played Schumann's Traumerei, 
the piece I always played with Kazuo, through the night.

1287
01:18:35,027 --> 01:18:37,030
But it won't change anything.

1288
01:18:37,031 --> 01:18:40,037
So I thought I have to make his last wish come true.

1289
01:18:40,038 --> 01:18:43,043
That I have my own duty.

1290
01:18:43,044 --> 01:18:45,048
Am I just trying to satisfy myself?

1291
01:18:45,448 --> 01:18:47,954
I'm only here because Akemi asked me,

1292
01:18:48,054 --> 01:18:51,059
but why do I have to come along?

1293
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:52,266
Come on, mom.

1294
01:18:52,366 --> 01:18:55,869
It's true, I knew her when she was in kindergarten, but...

1295
01:18:55,870 --> 01:18:57,975
I hope I won't cry.

1296
01:18:58,075 --> 01:18:59,881
It's better if you cry!

1297
01:19:02,884 --> 01:19:06,891
Hello, Kazumi. 
I'm Yoshino Akemi.

1298
01:19:07,930 --> 01:19:09,131
Akemi...

1299
01:19:09,231 --> 01:19:11,803
I've brought Kazuo's mom too.

1300
01:19:11,903 --> 01:19:15,099
Kazuo and Hiroshi asked me to bring her.

1301
01:19:16,413 --> 01:19:17,314
Mom...

1302
01:19:17,414 --> 01:19:19,409
Go ahead.

1303
01:19:21,824 --> 01:19:23,227
Kazumi,

1304
01:19:23,327 --> 01:19:25,733
it's been a long time.

1305
01:19:26,133 --> 01:19:28,739
You were so energetic...

1306
01:19:29,039 --> 01:19:31,044
Mom...

1307
01:19:31,144 --> 01:19:33,147
How are you doing with Kazuo?

1308
01:19:33,148 --> 01:19:36,154
Huh? Uh, yes.

1309
01:19:36,254 --> 01:19:39,962
But he also doesn't seem to be very energetic lately.

1310
01:19:40,162 --> 01:19:41,567
Oh.

1311
01:19:41,864 --> 01:19:43,068
But...

1312
01:19:43,069 --> 01:19:46,075
please get along

1313
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:49,783
Kazuo hates being lonely.

1314
01:19:50,183 --> 01:19:51,787
OK.

1315
01:19:52,187 --> 01:19:54,191
We get along very well.

1316
01:19:54,192 --> 01:19:55,596
He's my son, after all.

1317
01:19:55,693 --> 01:19:57,197
Right...

1318
01:19:57,198 --> 01:19:59,202
He's your son.

1319
01:19:59,302 --> 01:20:01,740
She's Akemi.

1320
01:20:01,741 --> 01:20:04,245
Kazuo's friend.

1321
01:20:04,246 --> 01:20:08,255
She came all the way from Onomichi to see him.

1322
01:20:08,355 --> 01:20:11,127
I've heard from Kazuo...

1323
01:20:11,227 --> 01:20:13,531
about everything, all of it.

1324
01:20:13,632 --> 01:20:15,335
Everything, all of it?

1325
01:20:15,435 --> 01:20:18,342
Yes, everything, all of it.

1326
01:20:18,442 --> 01:20:21,947
That's why I brought his mom here today.

1327
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:25,056
I see, that explains it.

1328
01:20:25,556 --> 01:20:28,002
Thank you, Akemi.

1329
01:20:33,974 --> 01:20:35,214
What are you two talking about?

1330
01:20:35,376 --> 01:20:37,380
About something important,

1331
01:20:37,381 --> 01:20:39,888
between me and Kazuo.

1332
01:20:41,289 --> 01:20:45,787
I'm glad... 
I got to see Kazuo's mom.

1333
01:20:54,216 --> 01:20:56,321
Really?

1334
01:20:56,421 --> 01:20:59,126
It's kind of strange...

1335
01:20:59,127 --> 01:21:01,331
but I'm glad I could be of help.

1336
01:21:01,631 --> 01:21:04,536
Then, I'll say a couple more strange things...

1337
01:21:04,537 --> 01:21:07,243
Take care, mom.

1338
01:21:07,444 --> 01:21:10,283
And also...

1339
01:21:10,284 --> 01:21:13,256
You should fall in love with someone too.

1340
01:21:13,356 --> 01:21:16,361
Geez, Kazumi!

1341
01:21:16,362 --> 01:21:19,559
You're not making any sense as usual.

1342
01:21:34,298 --> 01:21:35,201
Mom...

1343
01:21:35,302 --> 01:21:36,207
Kazuo's...

1344
01:21:36,303 --> 01:21:39,310
I'm sorry Kazuo is always causing trouble.

1345
01:21:39,410 --> 01:21:42,416
Not at all. 
You came all the way here to visit?

1346
01:21:42,516 --> 01:21:48,325
It felt as if I was talking to my own child while I was with her.

1347
01:21:48,463 --> 01:21:52,760
I'm sorry. 
You have my condolences.

1348
01:21:53,339 --> 01:21:56,345
I am grateful for your heartfelt visit.

1349
01:21:56,445 --> 01:21:58,249
Grateful.

1350
01:22:00,251 --> 01:22:01,656
Auntie?

1351
01:22:02,457 --> 01:22:05,462
Kazumi is young, 
so she can endure our treatment.

1352
01:22:05,464 --> 01:22:10,472
She may even regain her strength temporarily.

1353
01:22:10,475 --> 01:22:14,317
But after that short period of time...

1354
01:22:14,433 --> 01:22:17,135
It's best to ask her what she wants to do,

1355
01:22:17,136 --> 01:22:20,024
who she wants to see, while she still can.

1356
01:22:20,272 --> 01:22:22,176
Ah! Dad.

1357
01:22:22,177 --> 01:22:23,894
Kazuko.

1358
01:22:25,614 --> 01:22:26,918
Brother.

1359
01:22:26,901 --> 01:22:28,405
Yes?

1360
01:22:29,012 --> 01:22:30,516
Bro...

1361
01:22:30,817 --> 01:22:32,320
What is it?

1362
01:22:32,420 --> 01:22:34,826
How did Kazuko's mom die?

1363
01:22:35,227 --> 01:22:36,730
What?

1364
01:22:37,030 --> 01:22:40,037
Sorry for asking a strange question.

1365
01:22:40,237 --> 01:22:43,242
No problem, 
Kazumi.

1366
01:22:43,243 --> 01:22:46,350
I don't know the answer to that question either.

1367
01:22:46,450 --> 01:22:52,257
Why Yuriko went shopping by herself on that day, 
that afternoon,

1368
01:22:52,258 --> 01:22:55,264
and had to be hit by a car...

1369
01:22:56,169 --> 01:22:59,176
By a drunk driver, no less.

1370
01:22:59,276 --> 01:23:00,981
But you know,

1371
01:23:01,078 --> 01:23:04,185
I know very well what she lived for.

1372
01:23:04,887 --> 01:23:06,893
It's Kazuko.

1373
01:23:07,493 --> 01:23:11,601
Kazuko is here because we loved each other.

1374
01:23:12,303 --> 01:23:14,307
Kazumi.

1375
01:23:14,308 --> 01:23:16,811
No one knows why people die.

1376
01:23:16,812 --> 01:23:18,315
Maybe it's fate.

1377
01:23:18,316 --> 01:23:20,820
But you decide what you're living for.

1378
01:23:20,821 --> 01:23:23,360
I guess that's why we fall in love.

1379
01:23:23,561 --> 01:23:26,233
That's why, you have to live.

1380
01:23:26,333 --> 01:23:28,471
Live your own way.

1381
01:23:28,571 --> 01:23:30,743
Give it a try.

1382
01:23:32,345 --> 01:23:33,548
Brother.

1383
01:23:33,649 --> 01:23:36,253
I'm glad I'm your sister.

1384
01:23:36,754 --> 01:23:39,250
Try to live, sis.

1385
01:23:45,306 --> 01:23:47,210
Are you feeling well today?

1386
01:23:47,634 --> 01:23:52,942
Yeah, I feel well on some days.

1387
01:23:52,946 --> 01:23:55,452
Doesn't last long though.
- I see.

1388
01:23:56,931 --> 01:23:58,732
Can you open the curtains?

1389
01:23:58,733 --> 01:23:59,937
I want to see the sky.

1390
01:24:00,037 --> 01:24:01,332
Sure.

1391
01:24:05,514 --> 01:24:07,519
We're pretty high up...

1392
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:10,024
Kazumi.

1393
01:24:10,124 --> 01:24:11,528
What?

1394
01:24:12,228 --> 01:24:15,134
There's somewhere I want to go to.

1395
01:24:15,235 --> 01:24:17,239
You want to go somewhere?

1396
01:24:17,339 --> 01:24:19,744
Let's go then.

1397
01:24:20,345 --> 01:24:21,649
Do you think we can?

1398
01:24:21,747 --> 01:24:23,051
Where, Kazuo?

1399
01:24:23,251 --> 01:24:24,946
Let's just go!

1400
01:24:39,385 --> 01:24:40,588
Let's go.

1401
01:24:41,289 --> 01:24:42,983
From the emergency stairs.

1402
01:25:03,735 --> 01:25:05,430
Come, hurry.

1403
01:25:11,986 --> 01:25:13,457
Over there.

1404
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:17,263
- Akemi.
- Huh?

1405
01:25:17,764 --> 01:25:19,169
Kazumi.

1406
01:25:20,470 --> 01:25:22,475
I can walk from here.

1407
01:25:23,776 --> 01:25:25,781
Kazuo...

1408
01:25:27,585 --> 01:25:29,389
Are you alright?

1409
01:25:29,489 --> 01:25:31,083
I'm alright.

1410
01:25:35,903 --> 01:25:37,606
Kazuo, are you really alright?

1411
01:25:38,007 --> 01:25:39,310
Kazuo?

1412
01:25:40,812 --> 01:25:42,707
Sorry for the trouble.

1413
01:25:47,426 --> 01:25:49,932
Hurry up!

1414
01:25:50,032 --> 01:25:53,538
I'll get disowned if my father finds out about this.

1415
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:56,345
That's better than having your attempted rape exposed.

1416
01:25:56,445 --> 01:25:59,451
What you're doing is called blackmail!

1417
01:25:59,551 --> 01:26:01,255
I'll give you a kiss as a reward.

1418
01:26:01,353 --> 01:26:02,254
Yeah!

1419
01:26:02,456 --> 01:26:04,852
Why is this happening to me...

1420
01:26:07,769 --> 01:26:09,473
Hey, Hiroshi.

1421
01:26:09,571 --> 01:26:10,473
Yes?

1422
01:26:10,474 --> 01:26:13,080
What's "The Sickness Unto Death" about?

1423
01:26:13,191 --> 01:26:15,395
- It's about despair.
- Despair?

1424
01:26:15,484 --> 01:26:17,388
Despair destroys people.

1425
01:26:17,488 --> 01:26:19,092
What about hope then?

1426
01:26:19,197 --> 01:26:21,602
"It is too difficult to understand, I don't know",

1427
01:26:21,797 --> 01:26:23,401
my grandpa said.

1428
01:26:23,501 --> 01:26:25,105
Your grandpa?

1429
01:26:25,205 --> 01:26:27,608
He kept reading that book until he died at 94,

1430
01:26:27,609 --> 01:26:30,415
"I am counting on you to figure out the rest".

1431
01:26:30,616 --> 01:26:34,112
I wonder if hope lies in what's left.

1432
01:26:49,755 --> 01:26:51,559
Is this far enough?

1433
01:26:51,659 --> 01:26:53,463
Yes, thanks.

1434
01:26:53,563 --> 01:26:56,469
Geez, kids these days!

1435
01:26:56,570 --> 01:26:59,575
I'm not involved anymore.

1436
01:26:59,576 --> 01:27:01,514
You're responsible for yourselves.

1437
01:27:01,614 --> 01:27:03,318
Thanks.

1438
01:27:03,518 --> 01:27:05,322
What about that kiss?

1439
01:27:05,522 --> 01:27:07,526
I don't want it!

1440
01:27:07,626 --> 01:27:10,623
The arrival of winter sure is sad!

1441
01:27:29,009 --> 01:27:31,248
This is as far as we'll go.

1442
01:27:31,249 --> 01:27:32,719
Yes.

1443
01:27:33,175 --> 01:27:35,079
Aren't we going together?

1444
01:27:35,450 --> 01:27:37,455
You two go together.

1445
01:27:37,555 --> 01:27:40,561
You two are protagonists of the same story.

1446
01:27:40,661 --> 01:27:43,867
I'm sure there are many things you two want to discuss alone.

1447
01:27:44,069 --> 01:27:45,272
Akemi...

1448
01:27:45,290 --> 01:27:46,205
Kazuo,

1449
01:27:46,273 --> 01:27:48,377
we didn't get to talk too much,

1450
01:27:48,378 --> 01:27:51,183
but I'll never forget you.

1451
01:27:51,184 --> 01:27:52,988
I'm going to quit piano.

1452
01:27:53,188 --> 01:27:56,594
That way I can treasure the memories of us together.

1453
01:27:56,696 --> 01:27:58,679
Thank you, Akemi.

1454
01:28:02,107 --> 01:28:03,210
Hiroshi...

1455
01:28:03,308 --> 01:28:04,610
Be careful.

1456
01:28:04,611 --> 01:28:07,917
Call the ambulance immediately if something goes wrong.

1457
01:28:08,015 --> 01:28:09,519
Yes.

1458
01:28:22,549 --> 01:28:24,486
<i>And so, Kazuo and Kazumi</i>

1459
01:28:24,487 --> 01:28:26,488
<i>walked the divine path.</i>

1460
01:28:26,489 --> 01:28:30,162
<i>They walked endlessly through the buckwheat field</i>

1461
01:28:30,465 --> 01:28:33,470
We're also all alone now.

1462
01:28:33,471 --> 01:28:36,376
Two walking the divine path, two lost love.

1463
01:28:36,377 --> 01:28:37,679
Isn't that right?

1464
01:28:37,879 --> 01:28:38,880
Yes.

1465
01:28:39,683 --> 01:28:42,679
Might as well share the same umbrella,

1466
01:28:43,492 --> 01:28:45,496
and write our own story.

1467
01:28:45,697 --> 01:28:47,702
Yes,

1468
01:28:48,503 --> 01:28:52,500
but you won't surpass Kazumi. I'm certain.

1469
01:28:53,713 --> 01:28:56,209
Kazuo either, huh?

1470
01:29:07,042 --> 01:29:08,545
Hey Kazuo.

1471
01:29:08,646 --> 01:29:10,912
I lied to you about one thing.

1472
01:29:11,048 --> 01:29:11,750
What is it?

1473
01:29:11,751 --> 01:29:14,256
That you killed my grandma.

1474
01:29:14,257 --> 01:29:16,261
Let's not mention her.

1475
01:29:16,361 --> 01:29:19,867
I think this is happening to me because of her curse.

1476
01:29:19,969 --> 01:29:21,371
No, it's not.

1477
01:29:21,372 --> 01:29:23,877
Grandma was already dead when it happened.

1478
01:29:23,897 --> 01:29:25,201
From a heart attack.

1479
01:29:25,298 --> 01:29:28,405
We saw her while my mom went to get the doctor.

1480
01:29:28,487 --> 01:29:30,392
You were lying to me the whole time?

1481
01:29:30,489 --> 01:29:31,593
I'm sorry, Kazuo.

1482
01:29:31,693 --> 01:29:34,297
But I only lied to you because

1483
01:29:34,298 --> 01:29:37,302
I wanted you to be a special person in my story.

1484
01:29:37,404 --> 01:29:38,409
I know that now.

1485
01:29:38,506 --> 01:29:40,311
A special person, huh?

1486
01:29:40,411 --> 01:29:43,217
But meanwhile, you were trying to forget about me.

1487
01:29:43,317 --> 01:29:46,323
That's also because I wanted to make you a special person.

1488
01:29:51,434 --> 01:29:53,438
OK, let's get going soon.

1489
01:29:53,538 --> 01:29:55,032
OK.

1490
01:29:58,448 --> 01:30:00,755
Where are you kids going?

1491
01:30:01,656 --> 01:30:03,751
Want to come with us?

1492
01:30:17,622 --> 01:30:20,393
We're performing in a hot spring inn.

1493
01:30:20,394 --> 01:30:21,797
What about you?

1494
01:30:21,895 --> 01:30:23,299
Uh, yes.

1495
01:30:23,399 --> 01:30:26,406
We're planning to go there too.

1496
01:30:26,506 --> 01:30:27,711
How lucky.

1497
01:30:27,808 --> 01:30:28,812
Kazuo?!

1498
01:30:28,967 --> 01:30:31,372
Oh? Then let's make it a nice trip.

1499
01:30:31,417 --> 01:30:32,155
Yes.

1500
01:30:32,218 --> 01:30:34,557
Are you sure, boss? I think they're runaways.

1501
01:30:34,657 --> 01:30:37,528
You can only be reckless when you're young.

1502
01:30:37,529 --> 01:30:39,433
You've done the same thing, haven't you?

1503
01:30:39,533 --> 01:30:42,539
I'm 2 tens and a five...

1504
01:30:42,540 --> 01:30:44,444
A young man.

1505
01:30:44,544 --> 01:30:46,448
But they seem like junior high students.

1506
01:30:46,548 --> 01:30:50,555
Fool, they have a reason they can't tell others.

1507
01:30:50,556 --> 01:30:54,063
The girl seems to be sick too.

1508
01:30:54,064 --> 01:30:56,068
Let's take care of them.

1509
01:30:56,168 --> 01:30:56,971
Yes, sir.

1510
01:30:57,069 --> 01:30:59,276
You haven't had breakfast yet, have you?

1511
01:31:00,077 --> 01:31:01,315
Eat this.

1512
01:31:01,378 --> 01:31:03,918
Thank you, we'll have it.

1513
01:31:05,421 --> 01:31:08,394
Wow, you can become an actor.

1514
01:31:08,494 --> 01:31:09,196
Huh?

1515
01:31:09,295 --> 01:31:13,701
People are born with certain qualities.

1516
01:31:14,506 --> 01:31:17,511
I'm playing a female role after years of training,

1517
01:31:17,512 --> 01:31:21,220
but you're born with the quality needed for female roles in Kabuki.

1518
01:31:21,514 --> 01:31:23,518
Would you like to enter this career?

1519
01:31:23,525 --> 01:31:25,529
Uh, no... I...

1520
01:31:25,629 --> 01:31:28,234
That suits him! It might be perfect for him!

1521
01:31:28,334 --> 01:31:29,639
Stop it!

1522
01:31:30,740 --> 01:31:32,242
That movement!

1523
01:31:32,243 --> 01:31:34,582
You're like a pro. Don't you agree, boss?

1524
01:31:34,682 --> 01:31:38,379
What, you want to make him your successor?

1525
01:31:50,681 --> 01:31:53,387
Thank you so much for coming.

1526
01:32:04,710 --> 01:32:06,705
I slay you!

1527
01:32:12,332 --> 01:32:17,330
I live for love!

1528
01:32:22,494 --> 01:32:26,091
I wonder if she's already asleep?

1529
01:32:27,658 --> 01:32:30,064
Hey, are you asleep?

1530
01:32:30,065 --> 01:32:31,070
No.

1531
01:32:32,266 --> 01:32:34,272
Can I go to your room?

1532
01:32:34,372 --> 01:32:36,076
I can't seem to fall asleep.

1533
01:32:36,177 --> 01:32:38,173
Yes, sure.

1534
01:32:44,468 --> 01:32:46,172
Kazumi.

1535
01:32:46,307 --> 01:32:47,265
Yes?

1536
01:32:47,361 --> 01:32:49,234
Can I join you?

1537
01:32:49,555 --> 01:32:50,458
What?

1538
01:32:50,739 --> 01:32:53,644
Don't worry, I won't try anything funny.

1539
01:32:54,748 --> 01:32:55,752
OK.

1540
01:32:58,458 --> 01:33:00,064
Then...

1541
01:33:01,986 --> 01:33:03,767
can I hug you?

1542
01:33:03,867 --> 01:33:05,973
Yeah.

1543
01:33:07,075 --> 01:33:08,869
Thanks.

1544
01:33:14,956 --> 01:33:17,663
Something's happening to me.

1545
01:33:18,864 --> 01:33:20,869
What's wrong?

1546
01:33:21,828 --> 01:33:23,732
You must know.

1547
01:33:23,975 --> 01:33:26,367
You're a boy.

1548
01:33:30,495 --> 01:33:32,500
I'm sorry, Kazuo.

1549
01:33:32,894 --> 01:33:36,101
I may not be able to control myself.

1550
01:33:37,302 --> 01:33:39,308
You may be right...

1551
01:33:40,791 --> 01:33:42,397
Hey...

1552
01:33:44,455 --> 01:33:46,250
Can I?

1553
01:33:50,731 --> 01:33:52,635
No, we can't!

1554
01:33:52,742 --> 01:33:53,647
Kazuo...

1555
01:33:54,012 --> 01:33:56,643
This is your body, after all.

1556
01:33:56,743 --> 01:33:59,349
And I'm in your body.

1557
01:33:59,449 --> 01:34:02,055
We can't do it like this.

1558
01:34:02,155 --> 01:34:03,559
But...

1559
01:34:03,759 --> 01:34:05,763
Let's forget about it, OK?

1560
01:34:06,764 --> 01:34:10,570
I don't know about complicated things like Hiroshi,

1561
01:34:10,672 --> 01:34:14,830
I want to be myself when...

1562
01:34:15,211 --> 01:34:16,882
When we...

1563
01:34:17,887 --> 01:34:21,794
And if I got pregnant...

1564
01:34:21,795 --> 01:34:25,303
I won't last for that.

1565
01:34:25,904 --> 01:34:27,608
You're right.

1566
01:34:28,909 --> 01:34:31,616
Let's get better first.

1567
01:34:32,617 --> 01:34:34,312
Yeah.

1568
01:34:39,933 --> 01:34:46,342
I've never seen my own face from this close before.

1569
01:34:50,306 --> 01:34:52,410
Then, show me.

1570
01:34:53,168 --> 01:34:55,173
Let me see myself.

1571
01:34:55,565 --> 01:34:56,770
Huh?

1572
01:35:00,384 --> 01:35:04,392
I'll never see my own body again.

1573
01:35:06,287 --> 01:35:08,190
So, please.

1574
01:35:08,579 --> 01:35:11,282
I want to take a last look at my own body.

1575
01:35:12,700 --> 01:35:16,697
Let me say farewell to my body.

1576
01:35:18,890 --> 01:35:20,385
OK.

1577
01:35:27,949 --> 01:35:29,944
It's beautiful.

1578
01:35:33,243 --> 01:35:36,048
See, our heartbeats

1579
01:35:36,049 --> 01:35:40,046
are in sync like a single metronome.

1580
01:35:44,583 --> 01:35:46,578
You're right.

1581
01:35:55,679 --> 01:35:58,585
Goodbye, me.

1582
01:35:59,297 --> 01:36:02,203
Goodbye, me.

1583
01:36:02,326 --> 01:36:04,331
Goodbye, me.

1584
01:36:04,408 --> 01:36:07,415
Goodbye, me.

1585
01:36:08,364 --> 01:36:10,068
Goodbye, me.

1586
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:12,424
Goodbye, me.

1587
01:36:12,524 --> 01:36:15,230
Goodbye, me.

1588
01:36:15,330 --> 01:36:18,136
Goodbye, me.

1589
01:36:18,537 --> 01:36:21,533
I will die for you.

1590
01:36:34,670 --> 01:36:36,777
I'm starving.

1591
01:36:39,580 --> 01:36:41,385
Do you have an appetite?

1592
01:36:41,485 --> 01:36:45,482
Yeah, it seems like my body is in a good condition today.

1593
01:36:46,595 --> 01:36:48,690
I'll find something to eat.

1594
01:37:05,434 --> 01:37:07,439
Yes, they seem like junior high students.

1595
01:37:07,539 --> 01:37:10,345
Our boss is a nice man, so he can't help it.

1596
01:37:10,445 --> 01:37:13,450
But they'll just get us into trouble.

1597
01:37:13,550 --> 01:37:17,548
Let's get rid of them before that happens.

1598
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:02,295
We're fine now.

1599
01:38:03,957 --> 01:38:05,861
- Hey...
- What is it?

1600
01:38:06,562 --> 01:38:08,467
Let's go home.

1601
01:38:09,566 --> 01:38:10,913
Yeah.

1602
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:15,080
Our moms must be worried.

1603
01:38:16,081 --> 01:38:17,584
More importantly,

1604
01:38:17,585 --> 01:38:19,889
You'll get really sick at this rate.

1605
01:38:19,989 --> 01:38:21,393
I guess.

1606
01:38:21,935 --> 01:38:23,940
But before that...

1607
01:38:24,199 --> 01:38:26,003
What?

1608
01:38:26,103 --> 01:38:28,808
I want to see the Spring of Sabishira.

1609
01:38:29,108 --> 01:38:31,003
The Spring of Sabishira?

1610
01:38:33,418 --> 01:38:35,421
My dream was to

1611
01:38:35,422 --> 01:38:38,830
turn my story into a song, and sing it.

1612
01:38:39,130 --> 01:38:42,636
But I don't have musical talent like you.

1613
01:38:42,838 --> 01:38:45,243
You're already singing your song.

1614
01:38:45,343 --> 01:38:47,338
At least, that's what I think.

1615
01:38:54,763 --> 01:38:56,658
Is this where you wanted to get off?

1616
01:39:13,801 --> 01:39:15,506
Thank you very much.

1617
01:39:16,107 --> 01:39:17,802
Thank you.

1618
01:39:25,826 --> 01:39:27,421
See ya.

1619
01:39:27,529 --> 01:39:29,124
Take care.

1620
01:39:36,158 --> 01:39:37,562
I'm sorry.

1621
01:39:37,659 --> 01:39:39,064
I'll walk.

1622
01:39:39,255 --> 01:39:41,159
You sure?

1623
01:39:41,259 --> 01:39:44,466
Yeah, 
I told you I'm in a good condition today.

1624
01:39:45,868 --> 01:39:47,262
OK.

1625
01:39:50,712 --> 01:39:51,716
See?

1626
01:39:53,898 --> 01:39:55,090
Watch out!

1627
01:39:55,685 --> 01:39:56,827
I'm fine.

1628
01:39:57,146 --> 01:39:59,097
I can walk with your support.

1629
01:39:59,698 --> 01:40:00,701
OK.

1630
01:40:01,001 --> 01:40:02,905
Let's climb together then.

1631
01:40:03,004 --> 01:40:06,511
But... which gate will we enter from?

1632
01:40:06,812 --> 01:40:10,415
Male's Gate and Female's Gate...

1633
01:40:10,416 --> 01:40:12,721
makes no difference to us now.

1634
01:40:13,026 --> 01:40:14,620
We've arrived.

1635
01:40:18,436 --> 01:40:20,442
Are you alright, Kazuo?

1636
01:40:21,042 --> 01:40:22,747
I'm fine, I'm fine.

1637
01:40:22,844 --> 01:40:24,349
I'm feeling good today.

1638
01:40:24,549 --> 01:40:25,852
Kazuo.

1639
01:40:25,953 --> 01:40:27,456
What is it?

1640
01:40:27,556 --> 01:40:29,961
When you die, I'll die too.

1641
01:40:30,061 --> 01:40:31,166
Huh?

1642
01:40:31,262 --> 01:40:34,068
I'll take my own life if you die!

1643
01:40:34,069 --> 01:40:35,370
Don't be stupid!

1644
01:40:35,371 --> 01:40:36,975
Why do you have to die?

1645
01:40:37,076 --> 01:40:39,982
Because... because I...

1646
01:40:40,082 --> 01:40:42,085
You have to live.

1647
01:40:42,086 --> 01:40:44,223
You have to live in my place.

1648
01:40:44,224 --> 01:40:46,193
Kazumi,

1649
01:40:46,194 --> 01:40:48,097
I'm starting to understand.

1650
01:40:48,098 --> 01:40:50,102
Hiroshi's words,

1651
01:40:50,103 --> 01:40:56,613
were supposed to be "I'll <i>live</i> just for you".

1652
01:40:57,116 --> 01:41:02,124
And I might just get cured, once I drink from the Spring of Sabishira.

1653
01:41:02,128 --> 01:41:04,131
Right, yes!

1654
01:41:04,132 --> 01:41:06,436
I'm sure you'll be cured.

1655
01:41:06,536 --> 01:41:08,640
Let's drink together.

1656
01:41:08,641 --> 01:41:11,236
From the Spring of Sabishira.

1657
01:42:17,183 --> 01:42:20,491
Hey, don't say you'll die!

1658
01:42:20,914 --> 01:42:23,910
You have to live, Kazumi!

1659
01:42:26,302 --> 01:42:28,007
Ah...

1660
01:42:29,208 --> 01:42:31,214
It's Kazuo.

1661
01:42:31,314 --> 01:42:34,821
Of course! I'm Kazuo, and you're...

1662
01:42:36,323 --> 01:42:40,120
Oh crap, our clothes switched again.

1663
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:46,035
Kazumi...

1664
01:42:52,858 --> 01:42:56,265
Hey, slap me. Am I dreaming?

1665
01:42:56,365 --> 01:42:59,271
Get ahold of yourself!

1666
01:42:59,371 --> 01:43:01,375
It hurts, it hurts!

1667
01:43:01,475 --> 01:43:02,379
Kazumi.

1668
01:43:02,476 --> 01:43:04,480
We've switched back!

1669
01:43:04,481 --> 01:43:06,787
Back to our own bodies!
- Kazumi...

1670
01:43:07,187 --> 01:43:09,192
I love you.

1671
01:43:09,292 --> 01:43:11,296
I really love you, Kazuo.

1672
01:43:11,396 --> 01:43:14,893
I love you more than anyone else.

1673
01:43:18,410 --> 01:43:20,414
For you, Kazuo,

1674
01:43:20,415 --> 01:43:22,419
I don't mind dying.

1675
01:43:22,719 --> 01:43:25,226
I don't mind.

1676
01:43:26,427 --> 01:43:29,434
I can die for you.

1677
01:43:31,236 --> 01:43:33,231
Wait...

1678
01:43:42,761 --> 01:43:44,766
Aren't you cold?

1679
01:43:45,367 --> 01:43:47,371
I'm fine.

1680
01:43:47,471 --> 01:43:50,476
Let me stay here for a while longer.

1681
01:43:50,477 --> 01:43:52,481
Two of us together.

1682
01:43:52,581 --> 01:43:54,484
I'm sorry.

1683
01:43:54,485 --> 01:43:57,491
We shouldn't have come to the Spring of Sabishira.

1684
01:43:57,492 --> 01:44:00,398
I was going to die for you.

1685
01:44:00,498 --> 01:44:02,502
No, I wanted to live for you.

1686
01:44:02,602 --> 01:44:04,506
Hey, Kazuo.

1687
01:44:04,907 --> 01:44:06,411
What?

1688
01:44:07,512 --> 01:44:10,518
It turned out for the best.

1689
01:44:10,519 --> 01:44:13,326
This is natural.

1690
01:44:14,158 --> 01:44:16,362
I will die as myself.

1691
01:44:16,831 --> 01:44:20,228
That's why you have to live as yourself.

1692
01:44:20,636 --> 01:44:21,870
OK?

1693
01:44:25,750 --> 01:44:27,553
Please,

1694
01:44:27,554 --> 01:44:29,159
promise me.

1695
01:44:30,660 --> 01:44:32,065
OK.

1696
01:44:34,568 --> 01:44:36,572
It's alright.

1697
01:44:36,573 --> 01:44:39,969
I'm filled with hope right now.

1698
01:44:43,587 --> 01:44:45,490
You see,

1699
01:44:45,491 --> 01:44:48,197
My body remembers.

1700
01:44:48,498 --> 01:44:52,106
The fingers you played piano with.

1701
01:44:53,006 --> 01:44:56,514
We didn't just switch.

1702
01:44:56,614 --> 01:44:59,622
We're already two as one.

1703
01:45:00,623 --> 01:45:02,228
Kazuo.

1704
01:45:04,331 --> 01:45:08,337
Hey, sing that song for me.

1705
01:45:10,643 --> 01:45:12,647
That song,

1706
01:45:12,648 --> 01:45:14,652
it was your song.

1707
01:45:14,952 --> 01:45:18,849
I mean, I don't know how to sing.

1708
01:45:19,662 --> 01:45:23,470
And I can't just come up with a song like that.

1709
01:45:23,570 --> 01:45:27,577
That song can't even be sung without your voice.

1710
01:45:29,483 --> 01:45:31,278
You're right.

1711
01:45:31,485 --> 01:45:33,780
Then let's sing.

1712
01:45:34,244 --> 01:45:37,250
Two songs as one.

1713
01:45:37,700 --> 01:45:39,203
Yeah.

1714
01:45:39,604 --> 01:45:42,700
Two stories as one.

1715
01:45:52,063 --> 01:45:57,569
<i>You will become a wind</i>

1716
01:45:58,070 --> 01:46:04,076
<i>Become an invisible wind</i>

1717
01:46:05,378 --> 01:46:11,885
<i>To your most most sought after place,</i>

1718
01:46:12,385 --> 01:46:18,892
<i>You will become a wind and reach</i>

1719
01:46:20,594 --> 01:46:27,101
<i>Don't laugh and say I'm strange</i>

1720
01:46:27,601 --> 01:46:33,608
<i>It's slightly embarrassing</i>

1721
01:46:34,885 --> 01:46:42,885
<i>You can see through everything</i>

1722
01:46:46,326 --> 01:46:56,485
<i>That's why I'm leaving you now</i>

1723
01:47:02,276 --> 01:47:04,271
- Here you go, dad.
- Thanks.

1724
01:47:11,135 --> 01:47:13,339
Honey, dad.

1725
01:47:13,598 --> 01:47:15,203
Kazuo brought flowers.

1726
01:47:15,403 --> 01:47:16,607
Oh, he's here?

1727
01:47:16,704 --> 01:47:18,609
Did you come for soba, Kazuo?

1728
01:47:18,707 --> 01:47:19,410
Yes.

1729
01:47:19,510 --> 01:47:20,514
Good.

1730
01:47:20,614 --> 01:47:22,618
I'll make great soba for you.

1731
01:47:22,918 --> 01:47:26,915
Kazumi was good at making soba.

1732
01:47:27,929 --> 01:47:31,837
She was a far better craftsman than her dad.

1733
01:47:31,937 --> 01:47:32,939
Did you know,

1734
01:47:32,940 --> 01:47:37,046
buckwheat grows in sterile land too harsh for other crops.

1735
01:47:37,047 --> 01:47:39,952
People who lived in such lands

1736
01:47:39,953 --> 01:47:43,961
made noodles from low quality flour,

1737
01:47:43,962 --> 01:47:45,967
and ate them to survive.

1738
01:47:46,067 --> 01:47:50,075
That's why, soba is in no way a tasty food.

1739
01:47:50,776 --> 01:47:56,085
But it's our job to figure out how to make it delicious.

1740
01:47:56,182 --> 01:47:57,186
I see.

1741
01:47:58,517 --> 01:48:00,121
That Kazumi,

1742
01:48:00,578 --> 01:48:02,761
she made soba in a strange way a while back.

1743
01:48:02,762 --> 01:48:03,966
Right?

1744
01:48:04,505 --> 01:48:05,443
Yes, she did.

1745
01:48:05,506 --> 01:48:07,845
- Shall we try it?
- No way!

1746
01:48:07,846 --> 01:48:09,616
It's Kazumi's way.

1747
01:48:09,617 --> 01:48:11,515
And it's for Kazuo.

1748
01:48:11,516 --> 01:48:13,111
Let's do it.

1749
01:48:27,954 --> 01:48:29,157
OK...

1750
01:48:29,658 --> 01:48:31,963
Can you let me do it?

1751
01:48:32,163 --> 01:48:34,568
Really? You want to try it?
- Yes.

1752
01:48:34,768 --> 01:48:36,763
OK. You try it.

1753
01:48:54,610 --> 01:48:57,617
That's a nice masculine sight.

1754
01:48:58,618 --> 01:49:00,221
Darn it!

1755
01:49:00,922 --> 01:49:04,319
It feels like Kazumi is back!

1756
01:49:21,766 --> 01:49:23,469
These are your change of clothes.

1757
01:49:23,470 --> 01:49:25,474
Wear a fresh pair of underwear everyday!

1758
01:49:25,574 --> 01:49:28,179
I know! I'm not a kid anymore.

1759
01:49:28,180 --> 01:49:30,183
I won't wet my bed either.

1760
01:49:30,184 --> 01:49:32,387
Did you pack your new cell phone?

1761
01:49:32,388 --> 01:49:34,492
Call me right away when you get there.

1762
01:49:34,693 --> 01:49:36,698
Don't let it soak in water again!

1763
01:49:36,798 --> 01:49:38,299
Fine, fine!

1764
01:49:38,300 --> 01:49:39,804
You're so annoying.

1765
01:49:39,904 --> 01:49:45,012
Your speech became so rude immediately after Kazumi passed away.

1766
01:49:45,115 --> 01:49:47,019
It just returned to normal.

1767
01:49:47,119 --> 01:49:49,122
True, now that you mention it.

1768
01:49:49,123 --> 01:49:52,230
But why Onomichi, of all places?

1769
01:49:52,330 --> 01:49:54,834
Because there's no sea in Nagano.

1770
01:49:54,934 --> 01:49:56,638
Sea?

1771
01:49:56,738 --> 01:50:00,344
When I grow up a bit more, I want to cross the sea,

1772
01:50:00,346 --> 01:50:03,353
and journey through foreign countries.

1773
01:50:03,953 --> 01:50:06,958
There are many different stories of the sea.

1774
01:50:06,959 --> 01:50:10,256
I want to visit them all.

1775
01:50:12,171 --> 01:50:14,777
Will that make you lonely, mom?

1776
01:50:15,978 --> 01:50:17,773
I won't be lonely.

1777
01:50:18,781 --> 01:50:22,378
You've finally found what you want to do with your life.

1778
01:50:22,591 --> 01:50:24,595
It makes me very happy.

1779
01:50:25,999 --> 01:50:28,002
But...

1780
01:50:28,003 --> 01:50:30,509
you're obviously staying in his place, right?

1781
01:50:30,609 --> 01:50:31,814
You know, mom.

1782
01:50:31,910 --> 01:50:34,816
You may be estranged from him,

1783
01:50:34,817 --> 01:50:37,423
but he's still a father to me.

1784
01:50:37,724 --> 01:50:40,328
Just as you will always be my mom.

1785
01:50:40,329 --> 01:50:42,834
He will always be my dad.

1786
01:50:42,934 --> 01:50:45,540
You're right, but still...

1787
01:50:45,740 --> 01:50:48,747
Oh well, at least you can play piano again.

1788
01:50:48,948 --> 01:50:50,950
I've already said goodbye to piano.

1789
01:50:50,951 --> 01:50:53,756
Anyway, they say blood is thicker than water.

1790
01:50:53,757 --> 01:50:56,962
I mean, I'm only here because you two did it!

1791
01:50:57,062 --> 01:50:57,964
Kazuo!

1792
01:50:57,965 --> 01:51:01,462
How can say something like that to your own parent?!

1793
01:51:02,676 --> 01:51:06,683
Mom, want to go to Onomichi with me?

1794
01:51:08,988 --> 01:51:13,897
Actually, I'm thinking of running this bar.

1795
01:51:13,999 --> 01:51:16,204
I'm still young!

1796
01:51:16,311 --> 01:51:17,815
Plus, I'm a beauty, right?

1797
01:51:17,816 --> 01:51:19,260
You're not supposed to say it yourself.

1798
01:51:19,261 --> 01:51:22,501
But without a doubt, you're a beauty.

1799
01:51:23,017 --> 01:51:25,713
Maybe you'll even fall in love with someone.

1800
01:51:27,327 --> 01:51:29,322
A good luck charm.

1801
01:51:32,037 --> 01:51:34,040
Do you want me to walk you to the station?

1802
01:51:34,041 --> 01:51:36,045
No, I'll go by myself.

1803
01:51:36,146 --> 01:51:37,140
Oh.

1804
01:51:43,394 --> 01:51:46,101
Ah, it's snowing.

1805
01:51:48,003 --> 01:51:50,008
Well then, have a safe trip.

1806
01:51:50,108 --> 01:51:52,013
Study hard.

1807
01:51:52,113 --> 01:51:53,118
OK.

1808
01:51:56,121 --> 01:51:59,729
<i>It snowed a little that morning.</i>

1809
01:51:59,825 --> 01:52:04,434
<i>It was like "once upon a time" in a fairy tale.</i>

1810
01:52:04,839 --> 01:52:07,845
<i>Snow is fitting for farewells.</i>

1811
01:52:08,045 --> 01:52:10,552
<i>Happy end...</i>

1812
01:52:10,848 --> 01:52:13,851
<i>Or will it be one?</i>

1813
01:52:13,951 --> 01:52:14,952
Hello, Akemi?

1814
01:52:15,053 --> 01:52:18,056
I just left home.

1815
01:52:18,132 --> 01:52:21,137
I'm just going to take a detour before heading for the station.

1816
01:52:21,138 --> 01:52:23,744
I think I will arrive on time.

1817
01:52:23,844 --> 01:52:25,849
So, how did it go between you and Hiroshi?

1818
01:52:26,250 --> 01:52:29,256
About that... Hiroshi is acting strangely.

1819
01:52:30,057 --> 01:52:32,062
He just emailed me a while ago,

1820
01:52:32,162 --> 01:52:37,169
"Your forehead is cute, I like the shape of your jaw."

1821
01:52:38,073 --> 01:52:41,081
As if he doesn't care about what's inside.

1822
01:52:41,181 --> 01:52:43,787
Are we really talking about that Mr. Kierkegaard?

1823
01:52:43,884 --> 01:52:46,790
Anyway, I can't wait to eat your udon.

1824
01:52:47,092 --> 01:52:49,096
Please make a good bowl for me.

1825
01:52:49,196 --> 01:52:51,602
I'm walking over snow right now.

1826
01:52:51,702 --> 01:52:54,398
It feels like I'm making udon.

1827
01:53:00,319 --> 01:53:01,814
Kazuo...

1828
01:53:12,639 --> 01:53:15,342
( Grave of Saitou Kazumi )

1829
01:53:16,087 --> 01:53:18,057
Goodbye, me.

1830
01:53:19,159 --> 01:53:21,154
Goodbye, me.

1831
01:53:26,373 --> 01:53:29,570
Goodbye, me.

1832
01:53:30,683 --> 01:53:32,278
<i>Goodbye.</i>

1833
01:53:36,807 --> 01:53:39,903
<i>Goodbye to you.</i>

1834
01:53:43,610 --> 01:53:48,608
<i>Extremely rare, but there is a disease that develops during puberty.</i>

1835
01:53:49,221 --> 01:53:52,518
<i>Saitou Kazumi died before she had grown up.</i>

1836
01:53:52,930 --> 01:53:56,927
<i>She will continue to live as a child.</i>

1837
01:53:57,135 --> 01:54:03,041
<i>To not forget</i>

1838
01:54:03,241 --> 01:54:10,749
<i>Is harder than I thought</i>

1839
01:54:12,303 --> 01:54:18,810
<i>But don't be upset</i>

1840
01:54:19,511 --> 01:54:26,018
<i>Just smile when you recall me</i>

1841
01:54:29,405 --> 01:54:31,410
<i>So, take care.</i>

1842
01:54:32,311 --> 01:54:34,917
<i>Take care, everyone.</i>

1843
01:54:35,418 --> 01:54:39,126
<i>Goodbye, the child in me.</i>

1844
01:54:39,326 --> 01:54:42,231
<i>This is how I became myself.</i>

1845
01:54:42,431 --> 01:54:44,336
<i>And...</i>

1846
01:54:44,636 --> 01:54:48,133
<i>Goodbye to you</i>

1847
01:54:49,743 --> 01:54:54,749
<i>Goodbye to you</i>

1848
01:54:56,250 --> 01:55:01,256
<i>We'll never meet again</i>

1849
01:55:03,758 --> 01:55:09,765
<i>Starting today, you'll be by my side</i>

1850
01:55:11,267 --> 01:55:19,267
<i>Smile back when I recall you</i>

1851
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:31,280
<i>Smile by my side</i>

1852
01:55:40,098 --> 01:55:44,102
( Everyone lives to leave their stories behind )

1853
01:55:44,302 --> 01:55:49,808

1854
