2
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:54,414
10 please.

3
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:00,188
I like your costume.

4
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,457
Thanks, I was going to cosplay
as Urahara from "Bleach",

5
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,026
but I couldn't
find the right hat.

6
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:06,994
I tried to dye
green streaks in it,

7
00:02:07,028 --> 00:02:08,930
but then the whole
thing turned green,

8
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:10,765
so I went with Naruto instead.

9
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:35,555
Mister Nimoy?

10
00:02:37,692 --> 00:02:38,960
Mister Nimoy?

11
00:02:40,962 --> 00:02:42,063
Mister Nimoy?

12
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:45,199
Mister Nimoy?

13
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:36,117
Shit.

14
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:38,451
Hello?

15
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:39,854
Heather, Your brother's here.

16
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:44,524
Uncle Jeffrey.

17
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:45,592
Uncle Jeffrey.

18
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:47,195
I'm your Uncle, I want respect.

19
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,463
Okay look, I brought
toys for you, look.

20
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:53,366
This, I just directed that,
okay you can have that one.

21
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,302
No fighting.

22
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,771
This one I just voiced, okay.

23
00:03:56,804 --> 00:03:59,539
And this one I voiced,
wrote and directed.

24
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,709
You don't care, goodbye.

25
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:02,710
Hi.

26
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:03,945
Hey, how's it going Heather?

27
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:05,246
Hey buddy.

28
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:06,280
What buddy?

29
00:04:06,314 --> 00:04:07,514
I don't want any books.

30
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:08,582
Okay.

31
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:10,251
I have to feed the baby,
we'll catch up later.

32
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:11,786
All right, I'll talk
to you later, bye.

33
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,387
Hey Rob, what's up?

34
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:15,823
Hey, dinner's almost ready.

35
00:04:15,857 --> 00:04:19,160
Cool, hey can I talk
to you afterwards?

36
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:20,027
For a minute?

37
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,497
Okay, good talk.

38
00:04:29,337 --> 00:04:31,239
I can't, I
just don't have it.

39
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,975
Just to get
me through the summer.

40
00:04:34,008 --> 00:04:36,010
What about NFL Films?

41
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:37,645
You won an Emmy with them.

42
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:39,146
Surely they can find
something for you.

43
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,481
That was 20 years ago.

44
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:43,718
Everyone I know there is gone,

45
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:44,551
or dead.

46
00:04:46,087 --> 00:04:47,989
Just go back to anime.

47
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:49,991
You're a superstar
in that world.

48
00:04:50,024 --> 00:04:51,826
Actor, writer, director.

49
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:52,760
Jeff Nimoy.

50
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:56,163
Yeah.

51
00:04:56,197 --> 00:04:57,597
It's complicated.

52
00:04:57,632 --> 00:04:59,066
It's complicated?

53
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,601
You know what else
is complicated?

54
00:05:00,635 --> 00:05:01,969
My checkbook's complicated.

55
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,406
Let me direct one
of your reality shows.

56
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,975
Also complicated.

57
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:08,910
You don't have the credits,

58
00:05:08,943 --> 00:05:10,211
you know I can't do that.

59
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:13,381
If you gave me a show
I'd have the credits.

60
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:16,183
If it were up to
me, I would, really.

61
00:05:16,217 --> 00:05:17,652
But it's not, I have bosses.

62
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:19,654
Go back to anime.

63
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,324
I just can't.

64
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:26,327
Then I can't help you.

65
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:28,595
I'm leaving.

66
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:30,331
Okay.

67
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:31,799
Bye.

68
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:32,833
Bye.

69
00:05:32,867 --> 00:05:33,768
Bye.

70
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:34,702
You okay?

71
00:05:35,937 --> 00:05:36,938
Fine, I just like,

72
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,140
do you have any Xanax?

73
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:40,908
I have like no
insurance right now.

74
00:05:40,942 --> 00:05:43,644
Yeah, left-hand
side, middle drawer.

75
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:46,247
How many do you need?

76
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,815
As many as you can spare.

77
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,183
Okay, well
don't take the whole thing.

78
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:51,819
I need them until the
kids are back to school.

79
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:52,653
Good?

80
00:05:52,687 --> 00:05:54,288
Okay, take those.

81
00:05:55,957 --> 00:05:57,457
Why do you need so much Xanax?

82
00:05:58,392 --> 00:06:00,094
Well I don't know, Heather.

83
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:02,263
Why would I need Xanax?

84
00:06:02,296 --> 00:06:04,265
Okay well, just be careful.

85
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:07,234
Bye buddy.

86
00:06:07,268 --> 00:06:08,836
Bye.

87
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:09,937
What's my name?

88
00:06:09,971 --> 00:06:10,905
Nimoy.

89
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:12,807
Say, Uncle Jeffrey.

90
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,674
Nimoy!

91
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:15,943
Leonard Nimoy.

92
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,880
Love you, buddy.

93
00:06:19,914 --> 00:06:22,582
Bye, love you too, bye.

94
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:23,451
Bye.

95
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:25,753
Eat something.

96
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:38,132
This is Jeff.

97
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:40,567
Hello, I'm
looking for Jeff Nimoy?

98
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:42,003
Who's this?

99
00:06:42,036 --> 00:06:44,238
Kyle Bailey,
I'm with Geek Kon.

100
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:47,008
Oh, hi.

101
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:49,110
Am I catching
you at a bad time?

102
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:51,679
Oh, no.

103
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:53,381
Great, well
if you remember,

104
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:55,216
we had you at our
anime convention

105
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,418
here in Madison, Wisconsin
about 10 years ago,

106
00:06:57,451 --> 00:06:58,886
and we were wondering
if you'd like

107
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,521
to be a VIP guest
again this weekend?

108
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:02,957
This weekend?

109
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,558
Yeah, we had a voice
director recently cancel

110
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,228
and we need a big name

111
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:10,031
for our voice acting
workshop and director panel.

112
00:07:10,064 --> 00:07:11,966
Are you available?

113
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:16,437
I don't know, I don't really
do anime conventions anymore.

114
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,006
In fact, I think the
last one I did was yours,

115
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,441
10 years ago.

116
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:22,309
Well, cons have
certainly changed since then.

117
00:07:22,343 --> 00:07:23,543
Oh yeah?

118
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,112
From what I remember
it's just a free trip

119
00:07:25,146 --> 00:07:26,714
to meet a handful of fans.

120
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:28,783
Well, true
the trip is free,

121
00:07:28,816 --> 00:07:31,352
like all cons we provide
your airfare and hotel room,

122
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:33,988
but you may not realize
that now cons do things...

123
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:36,023
Plus you know,
anime conventions,

124
00:07:36,057 --> 00:07:38,959
there's all that
handshaking, and hugging.

125
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:41,929
Lots of germ transference.

126
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:45,166
Well, one change is
we supply hand sanitizer now,

127
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,967
so I don't think
you need to worry.

128
00:07:48,402 --> 00:07:51,205
Yeah, well unless there's
some other major changes,

129
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:53,474
I think it's a hard pass.

130
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:55,443
Well, I was
trying to tell you,

131
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:58,212
the major change is we
now pay appearance fees.

132
00:07:58,245 --> 00:08:00,314
Cons are a lot bigger
than they used to be.

133
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:02,850
How does three
thousand dollars sound?

134
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:05,286
Mister Nimoy?

135
00:08:06,454 --> 00:08:07,988
Mister Nimoy?

136
00:08:08,022 --> 00:08:10,724
Oh, you wanted Jeff Nimoy?

137
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:15,362
Hold on, let me get him.

138
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,306
Jeff Nimoy.

139
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:48,162
Hi, I'm Jeff Nimoy.

140
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,297
Yes, I know.

141
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:53,100
I recognize you from
your Wikipedia page.

142
00:08:53,134 --> 00:08:54,034
What's your name?

143
00:08:54,068 --> 00:08:55,803
Oh of course, I'm Bobbi.

144
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:57,037
Hi Bobbi, nice to meet you.

145
00:08:57,071 --> 00:08:58,973
Nice to meet you.

146
00:08:59,006 --> 00:08:59,974
Shall we go?

147
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:01,742
Oh, sorry I'm nervous.

148
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:03,612
I just have never met
a big star before.

149
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:05,346
It's okay, I'm
not such a big star.

150
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:06,547
Don't be nervous.

151
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,283
Yes you are, you're like
the Steven Spielberg of anime.

152
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:12,820
Okay, at least the
Ed Wood of anime.

153
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,923
Can I get your bag?

154
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:17,158
No, don't be silly.

155
00:09:17,191 --> 00:09:19,226
No, you are a VIP,
you deserve the best.

156
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,061
Okay.

157
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,199
Trigun is like
my favorite anime,

158
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:26,734
and Wolfwood is definitely

159
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:28,169
my favorite character
of all time.

160
00:09:28,202 --> 00:09:31,138
When he died I cried
like a little baby.

161
00:09:31,172 --> 00:09:34,041
I cried too, when he
died I was out of a job.

162
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,443
Of course I prefer the
Japanese sub-titled version,

163
00:09:36,477 --> 00:09:38,112
but I don't think
that Sho Hayami

164
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:39,313
did as good of a job

165
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:40,915
at capturing Wolfwood's
essence as you did.

166
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:42,383
And your voice is much smokier,

167
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,784
which makes sense,

168
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,686
because as you know
Wolfwood is a chain-smoker.

169
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:47,656
You know, that
bag is on rollers.

170
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:49,924
You could just put
it down and pull it.

171
00:09:50,925 --> 00:09:51,825
Of course.

172
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:53,861
Yeah, that's how it works.

173
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:55,362
Been that way for a long time.

174
00:09:55,396 --> 00:09:56,697
Anyway, what an amazing
character Wolfwood was,

175
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,899
I mean a hard-drinking,
chain-smoking,

176
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:01,035
womanizing, perverted priest.

177
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:02,303
Typecasting I guess.

178
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:05,739
Wolfwood is 30, or maybe 40,

179
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:08,242
the characteristic
art style emerged...

180
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:09,644
Oh, Mister Nimoy!

181
00:10:09,678 --> 00:10:10,844
You made it!

182
00:10:10,878 --> 00:10:12,146
Kyle Bailey, we
spoke on the phone.

183
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:13,214
Hi Kyle.

184
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:18,653
I see you met Bobbi.

185
00:10:18,687 --> 00:10:20,187
Oh yes.

186
00:10:20,221 --> 00:10:22,823
She's quite the
encyclopedia of anime.

187
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:24,091
I'm a bit of a savant.

188
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,728
Bobbi will be your
handler all weekend.

189
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:28,596
Great.

190
00:10:30,431 --> 00:10:33,267
So is this pretty much
the way you remember it?

191
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:36,537
It smells the same.

192
00:10:37,905 --> 00:10:41,041
When you wear the same
costume for four days in a row,

193
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:43,544
sometimes things tend
to get a little, ripe.

194
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:44,511
Yeah.

195
00:10:44,545 --> 00:10:46,313
We call that, otaku funk.

196
00:10:47,682 --> 00:10:48,949
Lovely.

197
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:50,985
It gets far worse by Sunday.

198
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:53,187
As will my germophobia.

199
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,589
But I guess for 3000 dollars
I can put up with it.

200
00:10:55,624 --> 00:10:57,391
As long as they
don't try to hug me.

201
00:10:58,792 --> 00:10:59,593
They will.

202
00:10:59,628 --> 00:11:00,427
They will.

203
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:05,232
Hey,

204
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,303
can I possibly,
can I get my check?

205
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:12,741
Yes, of course, I'm so sorry.

206
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:15,976
That's not it.

207
00:11:17,378 --> 00:11:18,946
That I even have to ask.

208
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:19,780
There you go buddy.

209
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:21,148
Thanks, I'm sorry.

210
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,483
A little bit embarrassing.

211
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,084
No, no problem,
no problem at all.

212
00:11:24,118 --> 00:11:27,321
Okay, so you seem
to be taken care of.

213
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,222
Enjoy your stay.

214
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:29,056
Thanks.

215
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:30,157
I hope you like your room.

216
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,259
Thanks very much.

217
00:11:32,293 --> 00:11:32,993
Shall we?

218
00:11:33,027 --> 00:11:34,128
Yeah, it'll be just a sec.

219
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:35,296
The elevator.

220
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:36,765
Thanks.

221
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:38,633
Okay so, this is your room.

222
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:39,900
Okay.

223
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:41,235
And you have my number,

224
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:44,338
so if you need anything
just text me, call me.

225
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:45,607
Do you need anything?

226
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,610
Not unless you have
any Xanax.

227
00:11:48,643 --> 00:11:49,977
Sure.

228
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,278
How many do you need?

229
00:11:52,146 --> 00:11:54,081
As many as you can spare.

230
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:56,250
Take the whole thing,
I've got more at home.

231
00:11:57,686 --> 00:11:58,485
Gee thanks.

232
00:11:58,519 --> 00:11:59,621
No problem.

233
00:11:59,654 --> 00:12:01,690
Do you need anything else?

234
00:12:01,723 --> 00:12:03,457
I don't, but if I do,

235
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,492
I'll call you, or text you.

236
00:12:05,526 --> 00:12:06,460
Okay.

237
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:07,494
Okay, I've got your number.

238
00:12:07,528 --> 00:12:08,329
Yeah.

239
00:12:08,362 --> 00:12:09,163
Okay, goodnight.

240
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:09,997
Bye.

241
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:12,734
You're gonna
watch me go inside?

242
00:12:12,767 --> 00:12:13,967
Yeah, I just want to make sure

243
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:15,235
you get in okay, that's my job.

244
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:16,738
Sure, okay.

245
00:12:16,771 --> 00:12:18,138
I've been going through
doors since I'm 30 though,

246
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:19,406
so I know what I'm doing.

247
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,075
I know, sometimes
the keys are tricky.

248
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:22,343
Okay, goodbye.

249
00:12:22,376 --> 00:12:23,410
Bye.

250
00:12:23,444 --> 00:12:24,278
Sleep well.

251
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:25,479
Okay.

252
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:27,181
Don't let the lady
spiders bite.

253
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:29,116
Goodbye.

254
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:29,983
Bye.

255
00:12:31,753 --> 00:12:33,921
But you're still here
is what I'm saying.

256
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:36,056
I'll go.

257
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:36,890
I just.

258
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:37,726
Goodnight.

259
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,559
Goodnight.

260
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:39,493
Sorry.

261
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:40,695
You've got a room
too though, don't you?

262
00:12:40,729 --> 00:12:41,395
Yeah, yeah.

263
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:42,463
Okay I'll see you later.

264
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:43,297
Okay.

265
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,131
Okay bye.

266
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:44,965
Okay bye.

267
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:45,800
Go away.

268
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:46,668
Goodbye.

269
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,171
Hello Madison Geek
Kon, how you doing?

270
00:13:58,939 --> 00:13:59,973
Good to see you again.

271
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:01,175
You too, man.

272
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,310
Did you know you were the
first actor I ever hired in LA?

273
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,813
No way, really?

274
00:14:04,846 --> 00:14:05,946
You mean that Arnold
Schwarzenegger thing?

275
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:07,114
Oh my God you remember it?

276
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:08,348
Of course I do.

277
00:14:08,382 --> 00:14:10,050
It was Arnold
Schwarzenegger as,

278
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:12,152
he was a short order cook.

279
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:13,420
It's like, put
down the short ribs,

280
00:14:13,454 --> 00:14:14,689
what are you doing?

281
00:14:14,722 --> 00:14:16,858
That's not barbecue
sauce, it's blood.

282
00:14:16,891 --> 00:14:19,226
You remember every
line, it's insane.

283
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:21,061
Of course man,
that was a classic.

284
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:21,896
Oh my God.

285
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,564
All two episodes.

286
00:14:23,597 --> 00:14:25,199
I'm surprised it
lasted that long.

287
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:26,066
I know.

288
00:14:27,301 --> 00:14:28,469
Do you do many cons?

289
00:14:28,502 --> 00:14:30,504
Yeah yeah, I do
quite a few actually.

290
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:31,673
I do this one every year.

291
00:14:31,706 --> 00:14:32,640
Oh really?

292
00:14:32,674 --> 00:14:34,141
Yeah, I've got some
family here in Madison,

293
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:35,409
so it's a good excuse for me

294
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:36,811
to get a free trip
to see everybody.

295
00:14:36,845 --> 00:14:38,045
That's smart, good for you.

296
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:39,279
I miss working with you.

297
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:41,081
You too man, it's been great.

298
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:42,784
No one will hire me.

299
00:14:43,651 --> 00:14:44,551
Oh shit, that's me.

300
00:14:44,585 --> 00:14:46,019
I gotta go, see you later.

301
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:54,094
Whoa, has it been
a year already?

302
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,366
Damn, they'll let
anybody in here.

303
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,735
Jeff Nimoy!

304
00:15:02,637 --> 00:15:03,805
Brian Donovan.

305
00:15:03,838 --> 00:15:05,439
Oh my God, I can't believe it.

306
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:07,541
Dude, what rock did you
crawl out from under?

307
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:08,475
How long has it been, man?

308
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:09,811
I don't know, when did we wrap

309
00:15:09,844 --> 00:15:12,346
that crappy anime series
I directed you in?

310
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:14,448
Don't laugh too hard,
it's still on TV somewhere.

311
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:16,918
That's why I keep getting
invited to these things.

312
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:20,120
We polished that
turd pretty good then.

313
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:23,390
Hey man, I've been
looking around.

314
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,425
I can't believe how
the money's changed.

315
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:27,394
There's like some serious
big business going on here.

316
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,428
Tell me about it, brother.

317
00:15:28,462 --> 00:15:29,664
This is all I do know.

318
00:15:29,697 --> 00:15:31,131
Really?

319
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:32,499
Seriously man, I travel
almost every weekend,

320
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:33,668
and I make a fortune.

321
00:15:33,701 --> 00:15:35,202
Dude, sign me up.

322
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:36,136
Right?

323
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:37,705
No I'm not kidding, I need it.

324
00:15:37,739 --> 00:15:39,439
Hello, Brian Donovan.

325
00:15:39,473 --> 00:15:40,340
Hey you.

326
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:43,778
I was wondering
when I'd see you.

327
00:15:43,811 --> 00:15:45,279
Hey Jeff, do you
know Nikki Boyer?

328
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:46,213
No I don't.

329
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:47,147
Nik, this is Jeff Nimoy.

330
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,716
Yeah, of course I know you.

331
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,986
I'm your biggest fan.

332
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:52,854
Yeah, right?

333
00:15:54,856 --> 00:15:56,123
Oh, she's being serious.

334
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:58,225
Oh I'm sorry, that's sweet.

335
00:15:58,258 --> 00:15:59,526
Thank you.

336
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,695
No seriously,

337
00:16:00,728 --> 00:16:01,829
I really am.

338
00:16:01,863 --> 00:16:02,997
Why don't you work more?

339
00:16:03,031 --> 00:16:03,865
Oh, burn.

340
00:16:05,033 --> 00:16:06,868
No no, that is
not what I meant.

341
00:16:06,901 --> 00:16:07,769
Oh God.

342
00:16:07,802 --> 00:16:08,736
That's what she meant.

343
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,270
No it's okay, I
know what you meant,

344
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:11,438
don't listen to him.

345
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:14,141
Mister Brian Donovan.

346
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:15,576
Oh shit, that's me.

347
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:16,778
Bye.

348
00:16:20,815 --> 00:16:23,952
What do you say,
Madison, Wisconsin?

349
00:16:23,985 --> 00:16:24,819
Geek Kon.

350
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:30,925
So, you're an actress?

351
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,061
Yeah, a voice actress.

352
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:33,928
Yeah I.

353
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:36,229
Right.

354
00:16:36,263 --> 00:16:39,601
Sorry, I get a little
flustered around celebrities.

355
00:16:39,634 --> 00:16:41,970
Oh come on, you really
think I'm a celebrity?

356
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:45,940
Yeah, you're like
the biggest name here.

357
00:16:45,974 --> 00:16:46,975
Get outta here.

358
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,510
You are, I mean to me, anyway.

359
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,748
You should be my agent.

360
00:16:53,781 --> 00:16:55,717
Nikki Boyer.

361
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,451
Oh shoot, that's me.

362
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:58,820
Nice to see you, I'll
see you up there.

363
00:16:58,853 --> 00:17:00,655
Okay, go knock 'em dead.

364
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:05,793
Hi everybody.

365
00:17:05,827 --> 00:17:08,395
Oh my gosh, I am so,
so happy to be here,

366
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:09,998
and I'm so grateful
because honestly,

367
00:17:10,031 --> 00:17:11,264
I just want to thank the fans,

368
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:13,001
because if it
weren't for you guys,

369
00:17:13,034 --> 00:17:14,836
I would not be where I am today.

370
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:16,336
So thank you so much,

371
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,505
I can't wait to meet each and
every one of you on the con.

372
00:17:19,807 --> 00:17:20,908
Nikki Boyer.

373
00:17:20,942 --> 00:17:22,342
Mister Nimoy, are you ready?

374
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:23,276
You're next.

375
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,979
Yeah, I'm rarin' to go.

376
00:17:25,013 --> 00:17:26,781
Awesome, have fun!

377
00:17:26,814 --> 00:17:27,649
Thanks.

378
00:17:28,783 --> 00:17:30,785
He is a superstar
in the voice world.

379
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:33,387
You know him from Trigun,
you know him from Digimon,

380
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,223
you know him from
everything, Jeff Nimoy.

381
00:17:38,626 --> 00:17:40,360
Oh shit, that's me.

382
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,409
You guys, you
guys are too kind.

383
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:56,744
Thank you so much.

384
00:17:56,778 --> 00:17:59,212
Many of you I guess
know me from Digimon.

385
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:00,213
I played Tentomon.

386
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:02,884
A lot of you also know me as,

387
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:04,919
Nicholas D Wolfwood from Trigun.

388
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:09,489
I see we have a Wolfwood
cosplayer right here.

389
00:18:09,523 --> 00:18:11,224
Anyway, it's been a long time

390
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:12,660
since I've been to
one of these cons,

391
00:18:12,694 --> 00:18:15,328
and I'm really looking forward
to meeting a lot of you,

392
00:18:15,362 --> 00:18:17,999
and signing some autographs.

393
00:18:18,032 --> 00:18:19,701
If you want a
handshake or a hug,

394
00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:23,303
on request only, please.

395
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:26,239
Please bathe.

396
00:18:28,743 --> 00:18:29,576
Thanks.

397
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:37,852
Jeff Nimoy.

398
00:18:37,885 --> 00:18:38,720
Jeff Nimoy.

399
00:18:40,188 --> 00:18:43,157
Let's hear it for all of our
voice actor all-stars, huh?

400
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:53,000
Hey hey hey.

401
00:18:53,034 --> 00:18:55,302
There's the man.

402
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:56,137
How's it going?

403
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,805
Good, I'm here.

404
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:58,740
You're over there.

405
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:01,843
Hey man, how much are you
charging for your autographs?

406
00:19:01,876 --> 00:19:04,212
I think we should charge
the same, don't you think?

407
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:05,747
I don't know, free?

408
00:19:06,714 --> 00:19:08,049
Dude, you have to charge.

409
00:19:08,082 --> 00:19:09,917
Believe me, these
kids want to pay.

410
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,318
This is their super bowl baby.

411
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:12,820
And they save up all year,

412
00:19:12,854 --> 00:19:14,655
just so they can meet their
favorite voice actor, like me,

413
00:19:14,689 --> 00:19:15,990
and buy stuff from them.

414
00:19:17,892 --> 00:19:19,060
I'm more of a
director though really.

415
00:19:19,093 --> 00:19:20,494
I don't know,
it doesn't matter.

416
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:21,729
You've played plenty of voices,

417
00:19:21,763 --> 00:19:24,397
and you've directed the
biggest shows, right?

418
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:25,666
What did they used to call you?

419
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,168
The George Lucas of
anime or some shit.

420
00:19:27,201 --> 00:19:29,503
Spielberg actually, but
I'll take George Lucas.

421
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:31,172
Actually I'm more
of a Scorsese type.

422
00:19:31,205 --> 00:19:32,607
For a con this size,

423
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,941
we should probably charge
like 20 bucks a pop.

424
00:19:33,975 --> 00:19:34,942
Really?

425
00:19:34,976 --> 00:19:35,777
Yeah man.

426
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:36,778
Nine times out of 10,

427
00:19:36,811 --> 00:19:38,311
they sell it on Ebay
to the highest bidder.

428
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:40,248
You might as well
take your cut, baby.

429
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,984
What do you do, just
take the money yourself?

430
00:19:43,017 --> 00:19:44,852
Yeah sure, or you get
your guest relations kid

431
00:19:44,886 --> 00:19:46,087
to handle it for you.

432
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,221
That's why they're
called handlers.

433
00:19:48,122 --> 00:19:49,289
Are you sure this is legal?

434
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:50,691
Hell yeah.

435
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:54,862
Okay, if you say
so, 20 bucks it is.

436
00:19:54,896 --> 00:19:56,063
Damn, if this works,

437
00:19:56,097 --> 00:19:57,799
I'm gonna sell my
autograph on Ebay too!

438
00:19:57,832 --> 00:20:00,268
Oh, I'll be the
first bidder baby.

439
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,103
Set it up, set it up.

440
00:20:32,266 --> 00:20:34,101
Digi-armor energize.

441
00:20:49,884 --> 00:20:52,352
Yes, you want me to sign that?

442
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:53,187
Okay.

443
00:20:54,689 --> 00:20:55,823
Right here?

444
00:20:55,857 --> 00:20:57,158
Okay.

445
00:20:57,191 --> 00:20:58,693
Yes, okay.

446
00:20:58,726 --> 00:21:00,560
It's 20 dollars.

447
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:01,963
Oh, um.

448
00:21:01,996 --> 00:21:03,597
Here, just take it and go.

449
00:21:03,631 --> 00:21:05,032
What?

450
00:21:05,066 --> 00:21:05,933
You want a hug?

451
00:21:08,102 --> 00:21:08,903
Buddy,

452
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,974
there isn't enough hand
sanitizer in the world.

453
00:21:16,244 --> 00:21:18,478
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

454
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:20,181
Now that I understood.

455
00:21:21,249 --> 00:21:22,817
Next in line.

456
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:23,784
Say Jim!

457
00:21:23,818 --> 00:21:25,887
That is one bad outfit.

458
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,088
Whoo!

459
00:21:27,121 --> 00:21:29,190
Thank you, I wore
it just for you.

460
00:21:29,223 --> 00:21:30,958
I'm your number one biggest fan.

461
00:21:30,992 --> 00:21:32,093
Well, right back at you,

462
00:21:32,126 --> 00:21:34,028
I think I'm your
number one biggest fan.

463
00:21:34,996 --> 00:21:35,796
What's your name?

464
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,098
Lana.

465
00:21:37,131 --> 00:21:38,398
Just like Lana Turner.

466
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:39,267
Who?

467
00:21:41,235 --> 00:21:43,137
Never mind, she's someone old,

468
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,338
like me.

469
00:21:44,372 --> 00:21:46,539
No Lana Lang,
like from Supergirl?

470
00:21:46,573 --> 00:21:48,843
Sure, whoever that is.

471
00:21:48,876 --> 00:21:50,344
So I have a confession,

472
00:21:50,378 --> 00:21:53,080
I have posters of you all
over my room at school.

473
00:21:53,114 --> 00:21:54,749
There are no posters of me.

474
00:21:54,782 --> 00:21:56,117
Unless you have one
of my mug shots.

475
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:58,085
I mean Wolfwood posters.

476
00:21:58,119 --> 00:21:59,452
That makes more sense.

477
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:03,490
So, how much is
it for an autograph?

478
00:22:03,523 --> 00:22:05,092
It's 20 dollars.

479
00:22:07,228 --> 00:22:09,230
How about a photo with you?

480
00:22:09,263 --> 00:22:12,333
Yeah sorry,
everything's 20 dollars.

481
00:22:12,366 --> 00:22:14,168
I don't have 20 dollars.

482
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:16,604
Come on, please?

483
00:22:16,637 --> 00:22:19,607
Something to remember you by.

484
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,009
Well how much do you have?

485
00:22:22,043 --> 00:22:23,543
Nothing.

486
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:24,879
I'm a broke student,

487
00:22:24,912 --> 00:22:25,947
about to graduate.

488
00:22:27,815 --> 00:22:30,483
Then how did you
afford that VIP pass?

489
00:22:32,153 --> 00:22:33,888
Someone gave it
to me for free.

490
00:22:35,323 --> 00:22:37,325
And what did you give him?

491
00:22:37,358 --> 00:22:38,859
It was a him wasn't it?

492
00:22:38,893 --> 00:22:40,227
Maybe.

493
00:22:41,662 --> 00:22:43,898
Please, please please
please please please.

494
00:22:43,931 --> 00:22:46,499
Just something to
remember you by.

495
00:22:48,069 --> 00:22:49,337
I don't know.

496
00:22:53,506 --> 00:22:55,776
Well, maybe we can

497
00:22:58,045 --> 00:22:59,113
I don't know, barter?

498
00:23:00,281 --> 00:23:01,115
Like how?

499
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,384
You know, trade.

500
00:23:05,086 --> 00:23:08,289
I give you an autograph
and take a photo with you.

501
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,826
And what do I
give you in return?

502
00:23:14,929 --> 00:23:16,931
You're a lot of trouble.

503
00:23:16,964 --> 00:23:17,798
Maybe.

504
00:23:22,103 --> 00:23:24,872
It's probably best I
couldn't do it anyway.

505
00:23:24,905 --> 00:23:26,674
Has that ever
happened to you before?

506
00:23:27,742 --> 00:23:28,943
I can't remember,

507
00:23:28,976 --> 00:23:31,345
it's been so long
since I've had sex.

508
00:23:31,379 --> 00:23:32,346
Oh come on,

509
00:23:33,447 --> 00:23:36,583
a sexy, famous,
looking man like you?

510
00:23:36,617 --> 00:23:37,852
At this convention,

511
00:23:37,885 --> 00:23:39,120
I'm famous and sexy.

512
00:23:39,153 --> 00:23:41,889
Back in LA, I'm George Costanza.

513
00:23:43,124 --> 00:23:45,393
You don't have to
be famous to have sex.

514
00:23:45,426 --> 00:23:46,660
No, but it helps.

515
00:23:48,195 --> 00:23:49,596
It helps fill the void, too.

516
00:23:51,065 --> 00:23:53,868
I've filled it with fame, women,

517
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:57,772
alcohol, weed.

518
00:23:59,673 --> 00:24:00,508
Sounds fun.

519
00:24:03,644 --> 00:24:04,478
Anyway,

520
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:08,516
meaningless sex just wound up

521
00:24:08,548 --> 00:24:10,418
hurting a lot of people,

522
00:24:10,451 --> 00:24:12,319
especially girls like
you at these conventions.

523
00:24:12,353 --> 00:24:15,256
So one day I decided
I'm only gonna have sex

524
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:17,291
with people I want
to wake up next to.

525
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:20,161
That was almost 10 years ago.

526
00:24:21,128 --> 00:24:22,329
I haven't had sex since.

527
00:24:23,497 --> 00:24:24,932
You haven't had
sex in 10 years?

528
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:26,100
That's insane.

529
00:24:27,201 --> 00:24:28,369
Tell me about it,

530
00:24:28,402 --> 00:24:29,937
I'm wankin' it like
a spider monkey.

531
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:34,308
But you were ready
to have sex with me.

532
00:24:36,811 --> 00:24:38,479
I know, I'm sorry.

533
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,749
I'm really sorry, Lana.

534
00:24:41,782 --> 00:24:44,652
But this fake fame
has gone to my head.

535
00:24:44,685 --> 00:24:46,720
I thought I came to this
convention for money,

536
00:24:46,754 --> 00:24:50,057
but now I'm thinkin' I
came for the ego boost.

537
00:24:51,292 --> 00:24:52,493
But you are famous.

538
00:24:52,526 --> 00:24:53,593
You have an Emmy.

539
00:24:54,428 --> 00:24:56,197
From 1996.

540
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,798
Trust me, in Hollywood
they give out

541
00:24:57,832 --> 00:24:59,500
those Emmys like
Halloween candy.

542
00:25:01,602 --> 00:25:03,304
Man, I need a Xanax.

543
00:25:03,337 --> 00:25:04,138
I've got some.

544
00:25:05,439 --> 00:25:07,208
How many do you want?

545
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:10,377
As many as you can spare.

546
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,154
Thanks.

547
00:25:29,997 --> 00:25:30,931
Jeff Nimoy.

548
00:25:33,834 --> 00:25:35,269
Jeff Nimoy's cigarettes.

549
00:25:36,904 --> 00:25:39,473
You know, even though
we didn't like have sex,

550
00:25:39,507 --> 00:25:42,676
this is still like the
greatest day of my life.

551
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,745
I almost made love to Wolfwood.

552
00:25:44,778 --> 00:25:46,680
How many girls can say that?

553
00:25:46,714 --> 00:25:48,249
Only animated girls,

554
00:25:48,282 --> 00:25:51,385
'cause you know, he's fictional.

555
00:25:51,418 --> 00:25:52,253
Duh.

556
00:25:53,454 --> 00:25:56,090
I'm not like some
crazy fan or anything.

557
00:25:56,123 --> 00:25:57,091
I know you're not
really Wolfwood,

558
00:25:57,124 --> 00:25:58,592
but like at the same time,

559
00:25:59,593 --> 00:26:00,427
you are.

560
00:26:01,795 --> 00:26:03,197
My voice is anyway.

561
00:26:06,867 --> 00:26:09,670
I can't believe you
won an Emmy in 1996.

562
00:26:10,804 --> 00:26:11,972
I wasn't even born yet.

563
00:26:20,714 --> 00:26:21,782
How old are you?

564
00:26:22,983 --> 00:26:24,118
18.

565
00:26:24,151 --> 00:26:25,219
What?

566
00:26:25,252 --> 00:26:26,420
I thought you told me

567
00:26:26,453 --> 00:26:27,988
you were about to
graduate from school?

568
00:26:28,022 --> 00:26:30,024
I am, Madison Girls Academy.

569
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:32,560
High school.

570
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:33,928
Holy shit!

571
00:26:35,496 --> 00:26:36,530
What's wrong?

572
00:26:36,564 --> 00:26:37,632
I usually have to be wasted

573
00:26:37,666 --> 00:26:39,266
to get into this
kind of trouble.

574
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,368
Thank God I couldn't get it up.

575
00:26:41,402 --> 00:26:42,637
What are you doing?

576
00:26:42,671 --> 00:26:45,272
I'm looking up the age
of consent in Wisconsin.

577
00:26:45,306 --> 00:26:47,007
Oh thank God, it's 18.

578
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:49,109
Still, you have
to go, right now.

579
00:26:49,143 --> 00:26:51,078
I thought we were
gonna hang out.

580
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:52,346
No no no no,

581
00:26:52,379 --> 00:26:53,514
we're never going
to hang out again.

582
00:26:53,547 --> 00:26:54,882
Don't you understand?

583
00:26:54,915 --> 00:26:56,483
I'm almost 50.

584
00:26:56,517 --> 00:26:58,519
It was bad enough when
I thought you were 21.

585
00:26:58,552 --> 00:26:59,987
People will think it's creepy.

586
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,890
I'm me and I think it's creepy.

587
00:27:02,923 --> 00:27:04,892
I won't tell
anyone, I promise.

588
00:27:04,925 --> 00:27:07,094
Please, please please please,

589
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:08,796
if you are my biggest fan,

590
00:27:08,829 --> 00:27:12,433
you'll help me out and forget
this every happened, okay?

591
00:27:14,168 --> 00:27:15,002
Lana!

592
00:27:15,803 --> 00:27:16,570
Okay.

593
00:27:16,605 --> 00:27:17,504
Let's go.

594
00:27:17,538 --> 00:27:18,772
God, you sound like my dad.

595
00:27:18,806 --> 00:27:20,074
Yeah, I'm probably
older than your dad,

596
00:27:20,107 --> 00:27:21,308
so let's go, chop-chop.

597
00:27:37,424 --> 00:27:39,360
So I'd like to thank you all

598
00:27:39,393 --> 00:27:42,062
for coming to my
voice director panel,

599
00:27:42,096 --> 00:27:44,832
and stick around because
in this same room,

600
00:27:44,865 --> 00:27:48,235
if you like voice
actors, and who doesn't?

601
00:27:48,269 --> 00:27:49,970
Except voice directors.

602
00:27:51,205 --> 00:27:52,773
And since I'm a voice
director and a voice actor

603
00:27:52,806 --> 00:27:54,241
I guess I hate myself.

604
00:27:56,543 --> 00:27:58,412
Wow, big crowd.

605
00:28:00,014 --> 00:28:01,515
But if you do
like voice acting,

606
00:28:01,548 --> 00:28:03,384
there is another panel
right after this,

607
00:28:03,417 --> 00:28:04,518
in this very room with

608
00:28:05,986 --> 00:28:09,390
myself, and Lex Lang, the
man of a thousand voices,

609
00:28:09,423 --> 00:28:12,293
and cryin' Brian Donovan.

610
00:28:15,562 --> 00:28:17,831
Nicknamed so because he
makes all the girls cry.

611
00:28:17,865 --> 00:28:19,701
Yeah, daddy.

612
00:28:22,002 --> 00:28:23,037
Hey man, I'm Davis.

613
00:28:25,172 --> 00:28:26,573
And Nikki Boyer.

614
00:28:28,142 --> 00:28:30,745
Who I just met, but I think is

615
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:33,347
very charming and lovely.

616
00:28:35,249 --> 00:28:36,417
Whooo!

617
00:28:37,484 --> 00:28:38,653
You guys.

618
00:28:40,722 --> 00:28:43,590
So stick around, and
we'll be right back,

619
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:45,259
thanks again, bye.

620
00:28:50,964 --> 00:28:52,132
You want a second autograph?

621
00:28:52,166 --> 00:28:53,668
No, come on.

622
00:28:56,604 --> 00:28:58,105
Hey hey, gal.

623
00:28:58,138 --> 00:28:58,972
Thank you.

624
00:29:00,107 --> 00:29:00,841
Thank you.

625
00:29:00,874 --> 00:29:01,776
Dude, what are you doing?

626
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:02,976
What?

627
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:04,779
It's not fair to charge
some fans and not others.

628
00:29:04,813 --> 00:29:06,347
You can't sign unless you're
at a scheduled session.

629
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,081
Oh right right.

630
00:29:07,114 --> 00:29:09,383
Guys, guys I'm so sorry.

631
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:11,285
I can't sign now, it's
against con policy.

632
00:29:11,318 --> 00:29:13,487
But, I have an autograph
session tomorrow at six,

633
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,622
please come by then.

634
00:29:14,656 --> 00:29:15,824
I'm so sorry.

635
00:29:15,856 --> 00:29:17,191
I know, I'm sorry, it's
my fault, I'm sorry.

636
00:29:17,224 --> 00:29:18,425
Sorry guys, yeah.

637
00:29:18,459 --> 00:29:20,160
Yeah, I'll see
you tomorrow, okay?

638
00:29:20,194 --> 00:29:21,028
See ya.

639
00:29:21,061 --> 00:29:21,895
Thanks, bye.

640
00:29:23,397 --> 00:29:25,065
You're gonna blow
the whole gig, dude.

641
00:29:25,099 --> 00:29:26,233
Very uncool.

642
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:27,868
I'm sorry, I'm
sorry, it's my fault,

643
00:29:27,901 --> 00:29:30,304
but we never used to charge
for autographs in the old days.

644
00:29:30,337 --> 00:29:32,841
Yeah, well welcome to
the new world, grandpa.

645
00:29:32,873 --> 00:29:34,908
Get it in gear, before you
send us back to the dark ages.

646
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:37,177
Okay, okay, relax.

647
00:29:37,211 --> 00:29:38,646
Grandpa?

648
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,347
I'm only two years
older than you.

649
00:29:40,381 --> 00:29:41,548
Yeah, whatever.

650
00:29:41,582 --> 00:29:43,283
Ooh, whatever, good comeback.

651
00:29:43,317 --> 00:29:46,153
No wonder they pay you
3000 dollars to be here.

652
00:29:47,722 --> 00:29:49,657
They paid you three thousand.

653
00:29:49,691 --> 00:29:50,491
Yeah, why?

654
00:29:50,524 --> 00:29:51,492
What'd they pay you?

655
00:29:52,493 --> 00:29:53,327
Two.

656
00:29:55,496 --> 00:29:56,930
Ain't that somethin'?

657
00:29:56,964 --> 00:29:59,701
Yeah, I'm gonna go
get us some waters.

658
00:29:59,734 --> 00:30:00,534
Hey you do that.

659
00:30:00,567 --> 00:30:01,902
Yeah.

660
00:30:01,935 --> 00:30:03,270
I like this anime crowd.

661
00:30:03,303 --> 00:30:04,672
I feel tough.

662
00:30:04,706 --> 00:30:06,808
How do I break into
the voiceover industry?

663
00:30:06,841 --> 00:30:09,677
You sorta have to move
to where the work is.

664
00:30:09,711 --> 00:30:12,579
I mean no one's hiring
in Madison, Wisconsin.

665
00:30:12,614 --> 00:30:14,716
So, you have to go where
they're doing the work,

666
00:30:14,749 --> 00:30:16,984
and for me, that means LA.

667
00:30:18,485 --> 00:30:19,953
This is for Nikki Boyer.

668
00:30:21,388 --> 00:30:24,391
Was there anybody you
wanted to be directed by?

669
00:30:24,425 --> 00:30:27,494
Oh that's easy, there's
this guy right over here.

670
00:30:28,863 --> 00:30:31,800
Well Nikki, I'm not really
considered a director.

671
00:30:31,833 --> 00:30:34,301
I wasn't talking about
you, I meant Jeff Nimoy.

672
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:36,170
Thank you, Brian.

673
00:30:36,203 --> 00:30:37,371
It's not all about you.

674
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,208
Thank you so much,
that's very flattering.

675
00:30:41,241 --> 00:30:43,477
Yeah, I've been
directed by him.

676
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,646
He's not so great.

677
00:30:47,247 --> 00:30:50,017
When I did direct you,
I agree, I wasn't great,

678
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:52,352
but I'm only as good as
the actors I work with.

679
00:30:56,323 --> 00:30:57,991
Well I'm only as
good as the writing,

680
00:30:58,025 --> 00:31:00,594
and the writing was
so bad on that show.

681
00:31:00,628 --> 00:31:02,429
Who did that show again?

682
00:31:02,463 --> 00:31:04,766
Oh wait, it was you.

683
00:31:06,601 --> 00:31:07,534
You didn't mind
those paychecks

684
00:31:07,568 --> 00:31:08,770
I wrote you though, did you?

685
00:31:11,972 --> 00:31:13,641
This shit just got real.

686
00:31:16,711 --> 00:31:19,413
I don't think I've ever
seen this much testosterone.

687
00:31:20,581 --> 00:31:22,149
You saw that much
when we used to date.

688
00:31:22,182 --> 00:31:23,350
Ooh.

689
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,689
You two dated?

690
00:31:27,722 --> 00:31:29,924
Briefly, on and off, okay?

691
00:31:30,859 --> 00:31:33,193
Believe me, it's still on.

692
00:31:33,227 --> 00:31:36,563
Kiss, kiss, kiss,
kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss...

693
00:31:36,597 --> 00:31:37,932
You guys want me to kiss him?

694
00:31:37,966 --> 00:31:38,933
Kiss, kiss, kiss.

695
00:31:38,967 --> 00:31:39,968
All right.

696
00:31:44,538 --> 00:31:48,475
Ooh.

697
00:32:06,393 --> 00:32:08,061
Yeah, it was nice meeting you.

698
00:32:08,095 --> 00:32:09,329
We're gonna mingle
a little bit more,

699
00:32:09,363 --> 00:32:11,064
and we'll see you later.

700
00:32:11,098 --> 00:32:12,165
Can I get a hug?

701
00:32:14,334 --> 00:32:15,135
Sure.

702
00:32:17,571 --> 00:32:18,873
I can die now.

703
00:32:18,907 --> 00:32:21,108
Okay, you do that, bye-bye.

704
00:32:27,247 --> 00:32:28,716
I hate these Meet and Greets.

705
00:32:30,384 --> 00:32:32,219
Why should we have
to work overtime?

706
00:32:32,252 --> 00:32:33,655
Because they pay us good money

707
00:32:33,688 --> 00:32:35,155
to meet like this, one-on-one.

708
00:32:35,188 --> 00:32:37,025
Yeah well, I'm not
seeing any of it.

709
00:32:37,057 --> 00:32:39,661
Yeah you are,
they pay to be here.

710
00:32:39,694 --> 00:32:40,662
Not enough.

711
00:32:50,838 --> 00:32:52,907
I wouldn't get too close
to him if I were you.

712
00:32:52,941 --> 00:32:53,775
To who?

713
00:32:54,742 --> 00:32:56,778
You know, Mister Kissy Face.

714
00:32:58,345 --> 00:32:59,781
Oh my God, are you jealous?

715
00:33:01,114 --> 00:33:02,617
Maybe.

716
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:04,184
But seriously, I heard he plowed

717
00:33:04,217 --> 00:33:06,520
like a million girls back
in the old days, on tour.

718
00:33:08,155 --> 00:33:10,290
Like you've
never hit on a fan?

719
00:33:10,324 --> 00:33:11,124
A million and one,

720
00:33:11,158 --> 00:33:12,694
but I'm just saying.

721
00:33:12,727 --> 00:33:14,062
Well, maybe he's changed.

722
00:33:15,295 --> 00:33:16,931
Doubtful, I saw him
leaving this afternoon's

723
00:33:16,965 --> 00:33:19,067
autograph session
with a young hottie.

724
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:21,201
Obviously a little Con nooner.

725
00:33:22,269 --> 00:33:23,671
Don't spread rumors, Brian.

726
00:33:23,705 --> 00:33:24,606
That's not cool.

727
00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:26,173
Fine, ask him yourself.

728
00:33:26,206 --> 00:33:27,541
Fine, I will.

729
00:33:29,911 --> 00:33:31,012
Okay.

730
00:33:31,045 --> 00:33:32,245
Yeah.

731
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:34,015
I'll be here when you
come crawling back.

732
00:33:39,053 --> 00:33:40,454
Hey, how's it going man?

733
00:33:40,487 --> 00:33:41,656
Well if it isn't Jeff Nimoy.

734
00:33:41,689 --> 00:33:44,157
Oh, how'd you kn...
oh, you cheated.

735
00:33:44,191 --> 00:33:46,094
I swear to God I didn't.

736
00:33:46,126 --> 00:33:47,160
How's it going?

737
00:33:47,194 --> 00:33:48,161
- Good.
- What's your name?

738
00:33:48,195 --> 00:33:48,963
- Brandon.
- Brandon,

739
00:33:48,997 --> 00:33:49,631
okay, how's it going?

740
00:33:50,832 --> 00:33:54,201
Can I get a, oh a club
soda please, thanks.

741
00:33:54,234 --> 00:33:55,435
That's it?

742
00:33:55,469 --> 00:33:56,269
Yeah.

743
00:33:56,303 --> 00:33:57,170
Come on,

744
00:33:57,204 --> 00:33:58,438
Mister Nimoy we've
got a full bar,

745
00:33:58,472 --> 00:33:59,874
you can get anything you'd like.

746
00:33:59,907 --> 00:34:03,176
Oh, oh, okay in that
case I'll have a club soda.

747
00:34:04,344 --> 00:34:05,245
Comin' right up.

748
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:06,380
Thanks man, I appreciate it.

749
00:34:06,413 --> 00:34:07,314
Hi.

750
00:34:07,347 --> 00:34:08,448
Oh hey, how's it going?

751
00:34:08,482 --> 00:34:09,684
Good.

752
00:34:09,717 --> 00:34:11,719
How about that
panel today, huh?

753
00:34:11,753 --> 00:34:12,552
Yeah.

754
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,488
How about that kiss?

755
00:34:15,422 --> 00:34:16,156
Sorry.

756
00:34:16,189 --> 00:34:17,557
No, don't be.

757
00:34:17,591 --> 00:34:21,228
It was fantastic, the highlight
of that hour, for sure.

758
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,732
Oh, how much do
I owe you buddy?

759
00:34:24,766 --> 00:34:27,602
Oh, nothing for VIP guests,

760
00:34:27,635 --> 00:34:29,704
only the fans and
staff have to pay.

761
00:34:29,737 --> 00:34:30,570
Really?

762
00:34:30,605 --> 00:34:31,505
Yeah.

763
00:34:31,538 --> 00:34:32,572
Can I get you anything?

764
00:34:32,607 --> 00:34:33,373
I'm good.

765
00:34:33,407 --> 00:34:34,574
It's on me.

766
00:34:34,609 --> 00:34:35,843
No, thanks though.

767
00:34:35,877 --> 00:34:36,744
Pretty generous of me.

768
00:34:36,778 --> 00:34:37,577
Yeah, pretty generous.

769
00:34:37,612 --> 00:34:38,445
I'm a giver.

770
00:34:40,114 --> 00:34:41,015
So?

771
00:34:41,049 --> 00:34:43,051
So, can I ask you a question?

772
00:34:43,084 --> 00:34:44,284
Shoot.

773
00:34:44,317 --> 00:34:46,319
What's your stance
on sleeping with fans?

774
00:34:49,222 --> 00:34:50,024
I'm sorry.

775
00:34:52,126 --> 00:34:53,193
Wow, didn't expect that.

776
00:34:53,226 --> 00:34:54,294
Caught you off-guard, huh?

777
00:34:54,327 --> 00:34:57,131
Well, to tell you the truth,

778
00:34:57,165 --> 00:34:59,701
in the old days I
was quite for it.

779
00:34:59,734 --> 00:35:01,169
But now that I'm older,

780
00:35:01,201 --> 00:35:04,605
I don't foresee myself
doing much of it anymore.

781
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:05,840
Really?

782
00:35:05,873 --> 00:35:07,340
Really.

783
00:35:07,374 --> 00:35:09,443
So what about that girl in
your autograph line today?

784
00:35:11,244 --> 00:35:14,015
That time it really
did come out of my nose.

785
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,582
Are you stalking
me, Nikki Boyer?

786
00:35:15,616 --> 00:35:17,151
Maybe.

787
00:35:17,185 --> 00:35:18,019
Okay.

788
00:35:20,088 --> 00:35:21,055
I thought about it.

789
00:35:22,123 --> 00:35:23,323
I thought about it hard.

790
00:35:24,491 --> 00:35:27,294
But in the end it wasn't
as hard as I thought,

791
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:29,596
to turn her down.

792
00:35:31,065 --> 00:35:32,432
Good.

793
00:35:32,466 --> 00:35:34,102
Good.

794
00:35:34,135 --> 00:35:35,136
You know, we met before.

795
00:35:35,169 --> 00:35:37,105
Oh, did we?

796
00:35:37,138 --> 00:35:38,639
Did you audition
for me or something?

797
00:35:38,673 --> 00:35:40,675
No, it was actually at a con.

798
00:35:40,708 --> 00:35:42,110
A con?

799
00:35:42,143 --> 00:35:43,644
Yeah, back in Saint Louis,
that's where I'm from.

800
00:35:43,678 --> 00:35:44,979
Oh wow, Saint Louis?

801
00:35:45,012 --> 00:35:46,346
That must have been
a long time ago.

802
00:35:46,379 --> 00:35:49,617
Yeah, gosh it was
like 15 years ago.

803
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,418
Wow, you must have
been like a kid?

804
00:35:51,451 --> 00:35:53,286
Well I was graduated
from college.

805
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,622
And you were already
a voice actress?

806
00:35:54,655 --> 00:35:55,857
No, not yet.

807
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:57,457
I was attending
the con as a fan.

808
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,527
Wait a minute.

809
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,830
My sleeping with fans,

810
00:36:02,864 --> 00:36:04,132
all this line of questioning,

811
00:36:04,165 --> 00:36:06,701
did we like make
out or something?

812
00:36:06,734 --> 00:36:07,668
No no.

813
00:36:07,702 --> 00:36:08,870
And you're busting me?

814
00:36:08,903 --> 00:36:10,705
- No.
- All these years later.

815
00:36:10,738 --> 00:36:12,640
All right, I'll take
your word for it.

816
00:36:13,841 --> 00:36:16,110
But, I was a big fan of yours.

817
00:36:17,044 --> 00:36:18,345
Still am I guess.

818
00:36:19,479 --> 00:36:20,313
Cheers to that.

819
00:36:21,448 --> 00:36:23,151
Anyway, I remember
that you stayed

820
00:36:23,184 --> 00:36:24,752
way after an autograph
session was over,

821
00:36:24,786 --> 00:36:26,319
to make sure that
each fan got one.

822
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:29,523
Must have been like five hours?

823
00:36:29,556 --> 00:36:31,692
Huh, I kind of remember that.

824
00:36:31,726 --> 00:36:33,194
And you didn't charge a cent,

825
00:36:33,227 --> 00:36:34,662
it was totally free.

826
00:36:36,164 --> 00:36:38,666
I guess it's different
circumstances for me now.

827
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:41,501
I'm sorry about that.

828
00:36:42,703 --> 00:36:44,939
Hope you made a lot of money.

829
00:36:44,972 --> 00:36:47,541
I did actually,
like a small fortune.

830
00:36:47,574 --> 00:36:48,810
Well, good for you.

831
00:36:48,843 --> 00:36:50,310
I mean look, it's not
a bad thing to charge,

832
00:36:50,343 --> 00:36:52,345
and I do it sometimes when
the other actors ask me to,

833
00:36:52,379 --> 00:36:53,781
but I usually end up

834
00:36:53,815 --> 00:36:55,850
giving the money to
charity or something.

835
00:36:57,185 --> 00:36:58,953
Well if it makes
you feel any better,

836
00:36:58,986 --> 00:37:00,487
the Jeff Foundation
is taking care

837
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,857
of poor impoverished
voice directors,

838
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:03,991
and paying their rent.

839
00:37:06,493 --> 00:37:09,063
Can I ask you
another question?

840
00:37:09,096 --> 00:37:11,364
What till I swallow.

841
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:12,633
All right, go.

842
00:37:12,667 --> 00:37:14,501
Why do you need
the money so bad?

843
00:37:14,534 --> 00:37:15,970
Oh geez.

844
00:37:16,003 --> 00:37:17,238
Don't be shy Nikki Boyer,

845
00:37:17,271 --> 00:37:19,372
ask me a real personal
question next time.

846
00:37:21,843 --> 00:37:22,810
It's a long story.

847
00:37:24,145 --> 00:37:25,746
Maybe after a few
more club sodas

848
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,782
I'll loosen up and tell you.

849
00:37:27,815 --> 00:37:29,349
Okay, that's fair enough.

850
00:37:31,484 --> 00:37:32,887
Want to walk around the con?

851
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,454
Yeah, great idea.

852
00:37:34,487 --> 00:37:35,957
Let's go.

853
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:38,292
Hey man, for the tip jar.

854
00:37:38,326 --> 00:37:39,126
Oh, thanks.

855
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,628
Thanks buddy.

856
00:37:40,661 --> 00:37:42,096
Easiest drink I'll have
to remember all weekend.

857
00:38:10,725 --> 00:38:13,593
You don't really like
the fans very much, do you?

858
00:38:13,628 --> 00:38:15,329
No, I do, I do.

859
00:38:15,363 --> 00:38:17,430
They just get a little
crazy sometimes,

860
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:18,866
don't you think?

861
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,868
No not really, I
actually think it's cool,

862
00:38:20,902 --> 00:38:23,037
because they're
usually outsiders,

863
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,272
and they feel like
they don't fit in,

864
00:38:24,305 --> 00:38:25,773
and I'm sure some of
them are even bullied,

865
00:38:25,806 --> 00:38:28,276
or made fun of for
liking cosplay so much,

866
00:38:28,309 --> 00:38:31,312
but here it's not like that.

867
00:38:31,345 --> 00:38:32,980
I never thought
of it that way.

868
00:38:33,014 --> 00:38:34,015
Yeah, you're right.

869
00:38:34,048 --> 00:38:37,084
This place is pretty nice.

870
00:38:37,118 --> 00:38:39,053
I haven't been this
relaxed in forever.

871
00:38:40,254 --> 00:38:41,454
Relaxed is good.

872
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:44,491
Stress will kill you.

873
00:38:44,524 --> 00:38:45,359
Oh yeah.

874
00:38:47,228 --> 00:38:49,562
I've also been a little
depressed lately.

875
00:38:49,596 --> 00:38:51,098
Well that's not good.

876
00:38:51,132 --> 00:38:53,566
No, it's like
very not good, okay?

877
00:38:53,601 --> 00:38:54,835
Believe me.

878
00:38:54,869 --> 00:38:56,637
Take the opposite of good, okay.

879
00:38:56,671 --> 00:38:57,872
What's the opposite of good?

880
00:38:57,905 --> 00:38:59,240
Not good, that's the
opposite of good.

881
00:38:59,273 --> 00:39:00,573
But that's good.

882
00:39:01,709 --> 00:39:03,244
I thought we'd do
the greatest tremendous

883
00:39:03,277 --> 00:39:05,913
most tremendous impersonations
of all time, okay?

884
00:39:05,947 --> 00:39:07,949
Probably the greatest
impersonator ever.

885
00:39:10,117 --> 00:39:11,152
Who else do you do?

886
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:14,221
I do Herve Villechaize.

887
00:39:14,255 --> 00:39:15,156
Hello boss.

888
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:17,758
I don't know who that is.

889
00:39:17,792 --> 00:39:20,460
Da plane, da plane!

890
00:39:20,493 --> 00:39:21,295
No.

891
00:39:21,329 --> 00:39:22,363
Fantasy Island.

892
00:39:22,396 --> 00:39:24,131
I think it's before my time.

893
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,336
How dare you?

894
00:39:28,369 --> 00:39:29,469
How dare you?

895
00:39:30,604 --> 00:39:32,740
See, how can you stay
depressed around me?

896
00:39:33,808 --> 00:39:34,709
I guess I can't.

897
00:39:36,077 --> 00:39:37,611
I mean, how depressed are you?

898
00:39:39,947 --> 00:39:41,649
Not as depressed as
this guy, obviously.

899
00:39:44,085 --> 00:39:45,019
That's him.

900
00:39:46,187 --> 00:39:47,321
Depressed, depressed.

901
00:39:47,355 --> 00:39:48,656
Like suicidal?

902
00:39:48,689 --> 00:39:50,257
- No!
- That's good.

903
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:51,392
Not today.

904
00:39:51,425 --> 00:39:52,827
Jeff?

905
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,196
Well if I did die, no one's
life would be different.

906
00:39:56,797 --> 00:39:58,833
People would be sad.

907
00:39:58,866 --> 00:39:59,834
I would be sad.

908
00:40:01,002 --> 00:40:03,037
Yeah, you'll all be
sad for a little while.

909
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:05,473
You know this guy'll be
sad for a minute or two.

910
00:40:05,505 --> 00:40:07,775
But no one's life will
physically change.

911
00:40:07,808 --> 00:40:09,777
I have no wife, no kids.

912
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:11,145
It would be like
I was never here.

913
00:40:11,178 --> 00:40:12,013
Poof.

914
00:40:14,048 --> 00:40:15,850
There'd be no Digimon.

915
00:40:15,883 --> 00:40:17,385
Of course there would.

916
00:40:17,418 --> 00:40:19,220
I didn't create the show,
I was just a hired monkey.

917
00:40:19,253 --> 00:40:21,355
It's a fluke I even
worked in anime at all.

918
00:40:21,389 --> 00:40:23,556
I couldn't get
arrested as an actor.

919
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:27,261
Then I booked a cheap little
VO job in anime one day,

920
00:40:27,294 --> 00:40:30,831
and then worked it into
writing and directing,

921
00:40:30,865 --> 00:40:34,635
then I got Digimon, and I've
been stuck in anime ever since.

922
00:40:34,668 --> 00:40:37,905
It's not a bad
place to be stuck.

923
00:40:37,938 --> 00:40:38,773
If you say so.

924
00:40:40,074 --> 00:40:41,342
Wow, you are depressed.

925
00:40:42,777 --> 00:40:43,611
I'll be okay.

926
00:40:45,246 --> 00:40:47,148
As long as you're here.

927
00:40:48,015 --> 00:40:49,183
But as soon as you leave,

928
00:40:49,216 --> 00:40:50,718
I'll be depressed again.

929
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:54,889
Well I guess I'd
better not leave then.

930
00:40:57,557 --> 00:40:59,794
Well, be careful
what you wish for.

931
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,632
It's getting late.

932
00:41:04,665 --> 00:41:05,565
Let's get going.

933
00:41:08,536 --> 00:41:09,970
Later than I think.

934
00:41:10,004 --> 00:41:10,805
Oh!

935
00:41:13,741 --> 00:41:14,542
Hate you.

936
00:41:17,344 --> 00:41:19,080
Meanwhile, at the
hall of justice.

937
00:41:24,418 --> 00:41:27,388
Well, this is me.

938
00:41:27,421 --> 00:41:28,622
Okay.

939
00:41:28,656 --> 00:41:30,091
Thanks for today.

940
00:41:30,124 --> 00:41:33,027
I had a really good time.

941
00:41:33,961 --> 00:41:34,795
Me too.

942
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:38,199
Wanna come in for a nightcap?

943
00:41:38,232 --> 00:41:39,700
I thought you didn't drink?

944
00:41:40,935 --> 00:41:42,470
All right, you busted me.

945
00:41:43,471 --> 00:41:45,506
You did promise not to leave me.

946
00:41:45,539 --> 00:41:48,642
Oh promise is kind
of a strong word.

947
00:41:50,744 --> 00:41:53,013
I just don't want
the night to end.

948
00:41:53,047 --> 00:41:56,317
Are you sure your depression
can handle more fun?

949
00:41:56,350 --> 00:42:01,355
I can handle more of that
kiss you gave me today.

950
00:42:08,229 --> 00:42:10,364
Maybe I'll come to
your room tomorrow.

951
00:42:14,201 --> 00:42:15,202
Tomorrow, huh?

952
00:42:15,236 --> 00:42:15,970
Yeah.

953
00:42:18,272 --> 00:42:20,908
But I never said anything
about my room tonight.

954
00:42:25,212 --> 00:42:26,046
Okay.

955
00:43:28,075 --> 00:43:29,410
Yes!

956
00:43:29,443 --> 00:43:30,377
Yes!

957
00:43:39,587 --> 00:43:40,821
You can get some shrimp?

958
00:43:40,854 --> 00:43:43,190
Yes, I can get some shrimp.

959
00:43:45,259 --> 00:43:47,094
Okay well.

960
00:43:47,127 --> 00:43:48,495
He must really
want some shrimp.

961
00:43:48,529 --> 00:43:50,164
Voice actors love shrimp.

962
00:43:50,197 --> 00:43:53,200
I think they, maybe they
expect that on the set.

963
00:43:53,234 --> 00:43:54,068
All the time.

964
00:43:57,371 --> 00:44:00,107
Well look what the cat
from Trigun dragged in.

965
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,175
Hello Kitty.

966
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:02,576
Good morning.

967
00:44:02,611 --> 00:44:04,812
You look well rested.

968
00:44:04,845 --> 00:44:06,413
Thank you.

969
00:44:06,447 --> 00:44:07,682
Sleep well?

970
00:44:07,716 --> 00:44:08,617
Reasonably.

971
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:10,017
You?

972
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:10,951
Very well, thanks.

973
00:44:10,985 --> 00:44:12,253
Although I didn't have anyone

974
00:44:12,286 --> 00:44:14,021
to keep me warm last
night like you did.

975
00:44:14,054 --> 00:44:15,856
Are you stalking me, Brian?

976
00:44:15,889 --> 00:44:17,791
No, but I can tell
by your reaction

977
00:44:17,825 --> 00:44:20,527
that you were with
Nimoy last night, ha.

978
00:44:20,561 --> 00:44:22,329
Ha ha, not funny.

979
00:44:22,363 --> 00:44:23,797
No, not ha ha funny,

980
00:44:23,831 --> 00:44:25,966
ha ha the joke's on you.

981
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,401
Don't say I didn't warn you.

982
00:44:28,435 --> 00:44:30,004
Good morning, all.

983
00:44:30,037 --> 00:44:30,938
Hi.

984
00:44:30,971 --> 00:44:31,805
Good morning.

985
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:32,973
What's up?

986
00:44:33,007 --> 00:44:34,241
Hey, try the
sausages, Nikki did.

987
00:44:34,275 --> 00:44:35,242
This little one's
the perfect size.

988
00:44:35,276 --> 00:44:36,310
You're so juvenile.

989
00:44:37,211 --> 00:44:38,112
What was that all about?

990
00:44:38,145 --> 00:44:39,146
It's not worth it.

991
00:44:40,615 --> 00:44:42,082
Neither is this breakfast.

992
00:44:42,116 --> 00:44:44,551
Plus I don't see any food
handlers wearing gloves.

993
00:44:44,585 --> 00:44:46,053
I have a better idea.

994
00:44:46,086 --> 00:44:48,289
Why don't I buy you breakfast
downstairs with my per diem?

995
00:44:48,322 --> 00:44:48,989
Yes, indeed-em.

996
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:50,224
All right, it's nice to have

997
00:44:50,257 --> 00:44:51,760
some money in my
pocket for once.

998
00:44:55,996 --> 00:44:57,398
You were too perfect.

999
00:45:07,642 --> 00:45:10,911
I will have a waffle, and
a side of sausage please.

1000
00:45:10,944 --> 00:45:12,781
Great, could I
get you guys started

1001
00:45:12,813 --> 00:45:14,882
with some mimosas
or bloody mary's?

1002
00:45:14,915 --> 00:45:16,950
Ooh, I'll actually
have a bloody Mary,

1003
00:45:16,984 --> 00:45:17,885
extra spicy please.

1004
00:45:17,918 --> 00:45:19,520
Excellent, and you sir?

1005
00:45:19,553 --> 00:45:21,055
I'm good with
just coffee, thanks.

1006
00:45:21,088 --> 00:45:22,222
I'll be right back.

1007
00:45:22,256 --> 00:45:24,158
So, tell me
about this new job.

1008
00:45:24,191 --> 00:45:26,527
Oh, so it's an
interview for a producer

1009
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:30,197
of like "Best Beach Paradises,"
or some crap like that.

1010
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:31,031
That's great.

1011
00:45:31,065 --> 00:45:32,667
So you love the beach.

1012
00:45:32,701 --> 00:45:35,869
Yeah, yeah, but more importantly
it's a job in reality TV,

1013
00:45:35,903 --> 00:45:38,038
and if I can build
my reality TV resume,

1014
00:45:38,072 --> 00:45:39,808
I can hit up my
bigshot brother-in-law

1015
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,276
the reality TV
producer, for a gig.

1016
00:45:42,309 --> 00:45:43,745
- Great!
- Yeah.

1017
00:45:43,778 --> 00:45:45,012
Well, fingers crossed.

1018
00:45:45,045 --> 00:45:46,280
Thank you.

1019
00:45:46,313 --> 00:45:47,548
Here you go.

1020
00:45:47,581 --> 00:45:48,415
Thank you.

1021
00:45:50,217 --> 00:45:53,320
All right, to you
getting this job.

1022
00:45:53,354 --> 00:45:54,188
Thank you.

1023
00:45:57,324 --> 00:45:58,325
God, I need this job too,

1024
00:45:58,359 --> 00:46:00,527
I haven't worked in forever.

1025
00:46:00,561 --> 00:46:03,497
Why don't you just
go back to anime?

1026
00:46:04,666 --> 00:46:05,599
It's complicated.

1027
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:10,337
You don't drink
at all, do you?

1028
00:46:11,305 --> 00:46:13,340
Well, I used to,

1029
00:46:13,374 --> 00:46:14,609
a little too much.

1030
00:46:14,642 --> 00:46:16,977
Oh, is that a problem?

1031
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:17,846
It became one.

1032
00:46:19,614 --> 00:46:20,948
The slightest little
emotional setback,

1033
00:46:20,981 --> 00:46:22,751
and I reached for
the Jack Daniels.

1034
00:46:22,784 --> 00:46:24,952
Hurricane Jeff would come
blowin' through town,

1035
00:46:24,985 --> 00:46:26,688
destroying everything
in its wake.

1036
00:46:27,588 --> 00:46:29,056
So when did it get bad?

1037
00:46:29,089 --> 00:46:31,125
Oh yeah well,

1038
00:46:31,158 --> 00:46:32,259
there was an incident.

1039
00:46:36,263 --> 00:46:39,701
One drunken night I broke
into this recording studio,

1040
00:46:39,734 --> 00:46:40,835
that was underpaying me.

1041
00:46:40,869 --> 00:46:41,770
Uh oh.

1042
00:46:41,803 --> 00:46:43,470
I had the
keys, I let myself in,

1043
00:46:43,504 --> 00:46:45,807
but I started throwing
things around,

1044
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,241
messing with all the levels,

1045
00:46:48,409 --> 00:46:51,011
but then I went a little
too far, even for me.

1046
00:46:51,044 --> 00:46:53,013
Okay, what did you do?

1047
00:46:53,046 --> 00:46:55,249
I took a dump
on the control panel.

1048
00:46:56,917 --> 00:46:58,986
- No.
- Yes.

1049
00:46:59,019 --> 00:46:59,821
You didn't?

1050
00:46:59,854 --> 00:47:00,655
I did.

1051
00:47:00,688 --> 00:47:01,522
That is so gross.

1052
00:47:02,556 --> 00:47:04,391
I know, I know.

1053
00:47:04,425 --> 00:47:06,059
It was terrible.

1054
00:47:06,093 --> 00:47:08,095
I was fired the next day.

1055
00:47:08,128 --> 00:47:10,264
The day after that,
I quit drinking.

1056
00:47:11,131 --> 00:47:12,332
Smart.

1057
00:47:12,366 --> 00:47:13,534
Not smart enough.

1058
00:47:13,567 --> 00:47:16,403
I couldn't get arrested
in anime after that.

1059
00:47:16,437 --> 00:47:19,306
That's the complicated
part I told you about.

1060
00:47:19,339 --> 00:47:20,140
Is it that?

1061
00:47:20,174 --> 00:47:21,676
That's real complicated.

1062
00:47:21,709 --> 00:47:23,010
But I don't understand.

1063
00:47:23,043 --> 00:47:26,447
How did they know it
was you that, you know,

1064
00:47:27,615 --> 00:47:29,684
left the doodie
on the soundboard?

1065
00:47:29,717 --> 00:47:31,218
Yeah.

1066
00:47:31,251 --> 00:47:34,021
In a way I sort of confessed.

1067
00:47:34,054 --> 00:47:34,889
How?

1068
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:36,825
I signed my name.

1069
00:47:39,326 --> 00:47:40,327
With the doodie.

1070
00:47:41,562 --> 00:47:44,264
Here is
your food, pardon me.

1071
00:47:51,004 --> 00:47:52,740
I kind of lost my appetite,

1072
00:47:52,774 --> 00:47:54,308
everything looks
like a turd now.

1073
00:47:59,012 --> 00:48:00,514
You're so funny.

1074
00:48:05,452 --> 00:48:06,286
Oh my God.

1075
00:48:08,155 --> 00:48:09,523
Leonard Nimoy!

1076
00:48:09,556 --> 00:48:11,693
Well, if you have no appetite

1077
00:48:11,726 --> 00:48:15,395
then how about we
go back upstairs?

1078
00:48:15,429 --> 00:48:17,097
And work up an appetite maybe.

1079
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:19,199
Okay, I like that idea.

1080
00:48:19,233 --> 00:48:20,234
Okay, let's go.

1081
00:48:21,502 --> 00:48:22,536
All right.

1082
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:31,478
I'm comin', I'm comin'.

1083
00:48:31,512 --> 00:48:33,648
Hey, no no no, I know a
shortcut, I know a shortcut.

1084
00:48:33,681 --> 00:48:34,949
Go this way, yeah, yeah.

1085
00:48:56,671 --> 00:48:57,872
Thank you for the question.

1086
00:48:57,906 --> 00:48:59,774
I really loved doing Word Girl,

1087
00:48:59,807 --> 00:49:01,208
but I have to say,

1088
00:49:02,509 --> 00:49:03,343
thank you,

1089
00:49:04,244 --> 00:49:05,713
but I have to say
my all-time favorite

1090
00:49:05,747 --> 00:49:07,982
was probably Captain Infinity.

1091
00:49:08,917 --> 00:49:09,918
Any other questions?

1092
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:13,587
Yeah excuse me.

1093
00:49:13,621 --> 00:49:15,589
Hi Miss Boyer, I
have a question.

1094
00:49:15,623 --> 00:49:18,492
In Naruto, do you think
your character Shika-Shika

1095
00:49:18,525 --> 00:49:21,528
had a little crush on
my character, Rock Lee?

1096
00:49:23,463 --> 00:49:24,866
Really?

1097
00:49:24,899 --> 00:49:27,602
No actually, I think she
hated him, and I can see why.

1098
00:49:29,938 --> 00:49:30,805
Next question?

1099
00:49:30,838 --> 00:49:32,239
No no no, what about
when my character

1100
00:49:32,272 --> 00:49:33,708
saved your character's life?

1101
00:49:33,741 --> 00:49:36,476
Do you think she regrets that
they never became lovers?

1102
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:41,181
Actually in the backstory
that I created for my character,

1103
00:49:41,214 --> 00:49:42,416
they did become lovers,

1104
00:49:42,449 --> 00:49:45,285
but in the end, she
dumped his sorry ass.

1105
00:49:49,624 --> 00:49:51,659
Okay, final question?

1106
00:49:51,693 --> 00:49:53,928
What does Brian
Donovan look like naked?

1107
00:49:56,764 --> 00:49:59,333
Well, it's like
a bad anime series.

1108
00:49:59,366 --> 00:50:00,567
It looks all slick,

1109
00:50:00,602 --> 00:50:04,338
but the story line is
really hard to find.

1110
00:50:09,644 --> 00:50:11,012
All right you guys,
thank you so much.

1111
00:50:11,045 --> 00:50:12,512
I loved this, I look forward

1112
00:50:12,546 --> 00:50:14,749
to seeing you at six p.m. at
my autograph session tonight.

1113
00:50:14,782 --> 00:50:15,850
Okay?

1114
00:50:27,061 --> 00:50:27,996
Nik?

1115
00:50:28,029 --> 00:50:29,964
Hey Nik, come on wait up.

1116
00:50:29,998 --> 00:50:30,798
Nik, come on.

1117
00:50:30,832 --> 00:50:32,232
Nik, wait.

1118
00:50:32,265 --> 00:50:35,369
What, you totally
hijacked my panel, Brian.

1119
00:50:35,402 --> 00:50:36,503
Look, I'm sorry.

1120
00:50:36,536 --> 00:50:37,972
No, you're not sorry,

1121
00:50:38,006 --> 00:50:39,941
you just want to punish me
for being with somebody else.

1122
00:50:40,942 --> 00:50:43,611
No, no I want you back.

1123
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:47,414
Brian that is so messed up.

1124
00:50:47,447 --> 00:50:50,317
Listen, I've been thinking,
we ended prematurely.

1125
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:51,819
We never gave it a real shot.

1126
00:50:52,854 --> 00:50:54,122
But seeing you at the con,

1127
00:50:55,555 --> 00:50:57,424
makes me realize you're
the one that got away, Nik.

1128
00:50:59,593 --> 00:51:00,394
Brian.

1129
00:51:01,461 --> 00:51:02,262
Come on.

1130
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:05,165
You know you still
have feelings for me.

1131
00:51:06,266 --> 00:51:08,870
I, I don't.

1132
00:51:10,104 --> 00:51:12,172
I've been hanging out
with Jeff all weekend.

1133
00:51:13,173 --> 00:51:14,307
Oh, fuck Jeff Nimoy.

1134
00:51:20,882 --> 00:51:21,983
You fucked Jeff Nimoy.

1135
00:51:23,216 --> 00:51:24,052
Brian.

1136
00:51:25,887 --> 00:51:27,088
I figured you
guys fooled around,

1137
00:51:27,121 --> 00:51:28,022
but I thought.

1138
00:51:30,457 --> 00:51:32,093
I don't want to
hurt you, okay?

1139
00:51:34,729 --> 00:51:36,698
Why should I be
surprised, Nik?

1140
00:51:36,731 --> 00:51:38,900
You slept with me
on the first date.

1141
00:51:38,933 --> 00:51:40,400
How dare you.

1142
00:51:40,434 --> 00:51:43,537
Yeah well, I'm an idiot
to think I was special.

1143
00:51:44,706 --> 00:51:45,807
That's not fair.

1144
00:51:47,474 --> 00:51:48,341
I just...

1145
00:51:48,375 --> 00:51:49,276
It's just what?

1146
00:51:52,113 --> 00:51:54,414
I think I might be
falling in love with him.

1147
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:59,486
Again, I don't why
I should be surprised.

1148
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:01,488
You told me you loved me
on our second date, Nik.

1149
00:52:03,124 --> 00:52:06,761
Brian, don't do this.

1150
00:52:06,794 --> 00:52:08,295
I thought we were friends now.

1151
00:52:08,328 --> 00:52:09,130
Oh, God.

1152
00:52:17,972 --> 00:52:19,239
There you go.

1153
00:52:21,876 --> 00:52:23,211
Hey I'm a huge fan.

1154
00:52:23,243 --> 00:52:24,779
Could you relay this.

1155
00:52:24,812 --> 00:52:25,713
Sure.

1156
00:52:25,747 --> 00:52:26,981
Hi, I thought Jeff Nimoy

1157
00:52:27,014 --> 00:52:28,582
was supposed to sign
at this time today?

1158
00:52:28,616 --> 00:52:29,984
No, that was yesterday.

1159
00:52:30,017 --> 00:52:32,120
Today he signs with
Nikki Boyer at six.

1160
00:52:32,153 --> 00:52:32,987
Shoot.

1161
00:52:35,022 --> 00:52:36,456
Do have something
you want me to sign?

1162
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:38,993
Oh sure.

1163
00:52:39,026 --> 00:52:40,527
I mean what shall I do?

1164
00:52:43,765 --> 00:52:45,199
Okay.

1165
00:52:45,233 --> 00:52:46,768
So you really like Jeff, huh?

1166
00:52:48,069 --> 00:52:48,936
I mean yeah.

1167
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:50,838
Your favorite actor?

1168
00:52:50,872 --> 00:52:52,305
Wolfwood is like
my all-time crush,

1169
00:52:52,339 --> 00:52:53,540
but Jeff is just like.

1170
00:52:56,343 --> 00:52:58,012
We're really close friends like,

1171
00:52:58,045 --> 00:53:00,047
more than friends really.

1172
00:53:00,081 --> 00:53:00,882
Really?

1173
00:53:00,915 --> 00:53:02,083
Yes.

1174
00:53:02,116 --> 00:53:03,885
'Cause that's not
what he told me.

1175
00:53:03,918 --> 00:53:05,385
What?

1176
00:53:05,418 --> 00:53:07,255
No, he just said you
were his new Madison pump.

1177
00:53:07,287 --> 00:53:10,024
He's got a fangirl
in almost every city.

1178
00:53:10,057 --> 00:53:11,291
No, he doesn't sleep around,

1179
00:53:11,324 --> 00:53:13,661
he literally told
me he never has sex.

1180
00:53:13,694 --> 00:53:14,629
Oh no?

1181
00:53:14,662 --> 00:53:15,863
Yeah, he never has sex.

1182
00:53:15,897 --> 00:53:16,831
Why don't you ask him,

1183
00:53:16,864 --> 00:53:18,032
why don't you text
him right now?

1184
00:53:18,065 --> 00:53:19,000
I don't have his number.

1185
00:53:19,033 --> 00:53:19,934
He's sleeping with you,

1186
00:53:19,967 --> 00:53:21,002
but he doesn't give
you his number?

1187
00:53:21,035 --> 00:53:22,103
What does that tell you?

1188
00:53:22,136 --> 00:53:23,271
Okay, give me your phone.

1189
00:53:23,303 --> 00:53:25,873
I'll put his number in for you.

1190
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:30,611
Never has sex.

1191
00:53:30,645 --> 00:53:32,379
Tell that to Nikki Boyer.

1192
00:53:32,412 --> 00:53:34,347
They've been bumpin'
bellies since they got here.

1193
00:53:34,381 --> 00:53:35,683
No, I don't believe you.

1194
00:53:37,251 --> 00:53:38,820
They're probably doing
the hokey-pokey right now.

1195
00:53:38,853 --> 00:53:39,654
What time is it?

1196
00:53:40,822 --> 00:53:42,657
Time for his five
o'clock feeding.

1197
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:44,058
They're doing it, all right.

1198
00:53:49,496 --> 00:53:50,530
Hey wait,

1199
00:53:50,564 --> 00:53:51,699
wait your phone!

1200
00:53:54,769 --> 00:53:57,537
I can't believe I was able
to do it twice in one day.

1201
00:53:58,572 --> 00:53:59,674
You're not that old.

1202
00:54:01,108 --> 00:54:03,644
No, but twice is a rare
occasion for me indeed.

1203
00:54:03,678 --> 00:54:06,113
Well, I'm here to tell
you from experience,

1204
00:54:06,147 --> 00:54:08,216
you can still do it
twice in one day.

1205
00:54:10,985 --> 00:54:11,819
Thanks.

1206
00:54:13,788 --> 00:54:15,589
It's not just age, I told you.

1207
00:54:15,623 --> 00:54:18,226
I've been stressed
out of my mind lately.

1208
00:54:18,259 --> 00:54:19,593
I even started smoking again.

1209
00:54:19,627 --> 00:54:21,996
Oh no, uh-uh.

1210
00:54:22,029 --> 00:54:23,363
That's a big no.

1211
00:54:23,396 --> 00:54:24,799
'Cause I can't be with a smoker

1212
00:54:24,832 --> 00:54:26,200
so that has to stop.

1213
00:54:27,335 --> 00:54:29,270
I only smoke
when I'm stressed.

1214
00:54:29,303 --> 00:54:30,771
Take a Xanax, or something.

1215
00:54:33,506 --> 00:54:34,308
You want one?

1216
00:54:39,347 --> 00:54:40,181
No.

1217
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:44,384
I'm not as stressed
when I'm with you.

1218
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:47,788
You're like the best Xanax ever.

1219
00:54:49,522 --> 00:54:51,025
I'm thinking about

1220
00:54:51,058 --> 00:54:53,460
bottling you and selling you
to a pharmaceutical company.

1221
00:54:56,731 --> 00:54:58,299
Don't be stressed out
about your interview,

1222
00:54:58,332 --> 00:54:59,333
you're gonna get it.

1223
00:55:00,768 --> 00:55:03,570
I don't recommend going
broke in your late 40's.

1224
00:55:05,172 --> 00:55:08,142
Hey, maybe you
can't work in anime,

1225
00:55:08,175 --> 00:55:11,312
but they still love
you at the conventions.

1226
00:55:12,246 --> 00:55:13,147
Okay, so?

1227
00:55:14,348 --> 00:55:17,752
So, like you can make
thousands in a weekend.

1228
00:55:17,785 --> 00:55:20,888
Yeah, but all I need to
do is get invited first.

1229
00:55:20,922 --> 00:55:23,090
This is my first con
invite in 10 years.

1230
00:55:23,124 --> 00:55:25,059
They don't know
you're interested yet.

1231
00:55:26,593 --> 00:55:27,895
I don't know.

1232
00:55:27,929 --> 00:55:29,130
What's there to know?

1233
00:55:29,163 --> 00:55:30,831
This is a job, and
you need a job.

1234
00:55:32,266 --> 00:55:33,100
Yeah but,

1235
00:55:34,268 --> 00:55:36,771
I didn't move to LA to
be some Z-list celebrity

1236
00:55:36,804 --> 00:55:37,972
at anime conventions.

1237
00:55:38,839 --> 00:55:40,241
I didn't mean it like that.

1238
00:55:40,274 --> 00:55:41,742
It's just that

1239
00:55:41,776 --> 00:55:46,380
I came out to make real
movies and real TV shows.

1240
00:55:47,547 --> 00:55:49,283
Anime shows are real
movies and real TV.

1241
00:55:51,319 --> 00:55:54,021
Yeah, but no,

1242
00:55:54,055 --> 00:55:54,889
not to me.

1243
00:55:55,756 --> 00:55:57,124
I can't explain it,

1244
00:55:57,158 --> 00:56:01,696
I just, if I did this full-time
I'd feel like a failure.

1245
00:56:01,729 --> 00:56:03,731
That's ridiculous.

1246
00:56:03,764 --> 00:56:04,832
Do you consider me a failure?

1247
00:56:04,865 --> 00:56:06,000
No.

1248
00:56:06,033 --> 00:56:07,068
So neither are you.

1249
00:56:08,235 --> 00:56:11,238
So come travel with me.

1250
00:56:11,272 --> 00:56:12,472
Come on.

1251
00:56:12,505 --> 00:56:13,407
We're doing this
huge Digimon tour,

1252
00:56:13,441 --> 00:56:15,142
and I voice one of the leads.

1253
00:56:15,176 --> 00:56:16,243
I'm not in it.

1254
00:56:16,277 --> 00:56:17,477
So what? Who cares?

1255
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:20,348
You're Mister Digimon,
they'd love to have you.

1256
00:56:21,849 --> 00:56:22,917
You think?

1257
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:24,051
Absolutely.

1258
00:56:25,518 --> 00:56:26,654
Think about it,

1259
00:56:26,687 --> 00:56:27,822
going on tour together.

1260
00:56:29,023 --> 00:56:30,858
It'll be so much fun together.

1261
00:56:30,891 --> 00:56:31,692
Yeah?

1262
00:56:31,726 --> 00:56:32,626
Yeah.

1263
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:33,427
- Like this?
- Yeah.

1264
00:56:33,461 --> 00:56:34,662
Just like this?

1265
00:56:34,695 --> 00:56:37,098
Forget Xanax, you're
more like Viagra.

1266
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,235
Uh-oh, here comes another plane.

1267
00:56:42,203 --> 00:56:42,970
That's my phone.

1268
00:56:43,004 --> 00:56:43,938
Ignore it.

1269
00:56:44,839 --> 00:56:46,506
They keep texting.

1270
00:56:48,142 --> 00:56:49,677
They're just gonna
keep on calling.

1271
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:52,279
Let them call 9-1-1
if it's an emergency.

1272
00:56:58,019 --> 00:56:59,286
It's important.

1273
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,588
Could I be frustrated
after twice already?

1274
00:57:02,857 --> 00:57:04,591
What is this?

1275
00:57:04,625 --> 00:57:06,127
What is it?

1276
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,696
I think you should know I'm
also sleeping with Jeff Nimoy.

1277
00:57:08,729 --> 00:57:09,562
What?

1278
00:57:10,898 --> 00:57:12,033
You jerk!

1279
00:57:12,066 --> 00:57:14,402
Whoa take it
easy, who sent this?

1280
00:57:14,435 --> 00:57:16,437
Oh, there's so many
you can't keep track?

1281
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:19,240
Oh my God, that's
not what I mean.

1282
00:57:19,273 --> 00:57:20,641
Brian warned me of this,

1283
00:57:20,674 --> 00:57:23,110
he said that you had a
different girl in every city.

1284
00:57:23,144 --> 00:57:25,012
That is absolutely not true.

1285
00:57:25,046 --> 00:57:26,213
Why did he say it?

1286
00:57:26,247 --> 00:57:27,748
Oh fuck Brian
Donovan, who knows?

1287
00:57:27,782 --> 00:57:29,116
He's probably jealous of me.

1288
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:31,551
In the old days, when we
were on tour together,

1289
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:34,989
I was a little
rambunctious with the fans.

1290
00:57:35,022 --> 00:57:36,556
But that was a long time ago.

1291
00:57:36,589 --> 00:57:38,793
I haven't been like
that for years.

1292
00:57:38,826 --> 00:57:39,827
Who is this girl?

1293
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:41,095
I don't know.

1294
00:57:41,929 --> 00:57:43,697
She the girl that you
took up to your room

1295
00:57:43,731 --> 00:57:44,932
for a nooner on Friday?

1296
00:57:44,965 --> 00:57:46,100
What?

1297
00:57:46,133 --> 00:57:47,535
What?

1298
00:57:47,567 --> 00:57:49,569
Yeah, is she?

1299
00:57:50,471 --> 00:57:51,906
Don't lie to me Jeff.

1300
00:57:51,939 --> 00:57:53,774
I asked you about this last
night in the Green Room,

1301
00:57:53,808 --> 00:57:55,042
and you said that
it wasn't true.

1302
00:57:55,076 --> 00:57:56,744
I will swear on
a stack of Bibles,

1303
00:57:56,777 --> 00:57:58,913
I did not have sex
with that girl.

1304
00:58:00,815 --> 00:58:02,316
Did you bring her upstairs.?

1305
00:58:04,251 --> 00:58:06,787
Yes but, but, but, but...

1306
00:58:08,355 --> 00:58:09,824
Jeff, be serious.

1307
00:58:09,857 --> 00:58:12,460
But, but, I told you.

1308
00:58:12,493 --> 00:58:14,728
I thought about it, I
thought about it hard,

1309
00:58:14,762 --> 00:58:16,764
but I could not go
through with it.

1310
00:58:16,797 --> 00:58:20,501
And, and, I barely even
knew you at that point.

1311
00:58:20,534 --> 00:58:22,736
It's not about the timeline,

1312
00:58:22,770 --> 00:58:24,472
it's about the fact
that you lied to me.

1313
00:58:24,505 --> 00:58:25,739
A, I didn't lie to you,

1314
00:58:25,773 --> 00:58:27,274
and B, it is about the timeline,

1315
00:58:27,308 --> 00:58:29,009
because I didn't
even fall in love

1316
00:58:29,043 --> 00:58:30,411
with you until last night!

1317
00:58:33,781 --> 00:58:35,616
Did I just say that out loud?

1318
00:58:37,418 --> 00:58:38,252
Shit.

1319
00:58:40,754 --> 00:58:42,089
You fell in love with me?

1320
00:58:43,524 --> 00:58:44,725
I think I love you,

1321
00:58:44,758 --> 00:58:45,960
but I didn't want
to say out loud

1322
00:58:45,993 --> 00:58:47,528
because I knew it
would scare you away,

1323
00:58:47,561 --> 00:58:48,963
'cause it's so soon.

1324
00:58:54,802 --> 00:58:57,571
That was just during breakfast.

1325
00:58:57,606 --> 00:58:58,873
Oh hey guys.

1326
00:58:58,906 --> 00:59:00,241
Hi.

1327
00:59:00,274 --> 00:59:02,409
You look really
cute in that T-shirt.

1328
00:59:02,443 --> 00:59:03,277
Ah.

1329
00:59:04,879 --> 00:59:07,281
So you were with her
after you were with me?

1330
00:59:07,314 --> 00:59:08,082
What?

1331
00:59:08,115 --> 00:59:09,016
Mm-hmm.

1332
00:59:09,049 --> 00:59:10,217
Whoa, slow down, slow down.

1333
00:59:10,251 --> 00:59:11,485
Please tell me this
is not happening.

1334
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:12,820
I was in love with you!

1335
00:59:12,853 --> 00:59:14,588
You said "I love
you" to her too?

1336
00:59:14,623 --> 00:59:16,056
Of course not,
she's just a kid.

1337
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:17,725
A kid you took to bed.

1338
00:59:17,758 --> 00:59:19,593
Hey Jeff, please tell me,

1339
00:59:19,628 --> 00:59:20,728
please tell me,

1340
00:59:20,761 --> 00:59:22,029
because I'm starting to think
that you're a sociopath.

1341
00:59:22,062 --> 00:59:22,997
Did you?

1342
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:24,498
No, not the way
she's saying it.

1343
00:59:24,532 --> 00:59:25,666
This feels like another
timeline issue, because...

1344
00:59:25,699 --> 00:59:26,934
I'm such an idiot.

1345
00:59:26,967 --> 00:59:28,135
I'm an idiot.

1346
00:59:28,169 --> 00:59:29,638
You're gonna fall in
love in a split second,

1347
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:30,971
and then a split second
later, I'm getting burned.

1348
00:59:31,005 --> 00:59:32,439
I'm not burning you.

1349
00:59:32,473 --> 00:59:34,441
I'm the one who's getting
burned, I had him first!

1350
00:59:34,475 --> 00:59:35,276
What did I expect?

1351
00:59:35,309 --> 00:59:36,510
I don't even know you.

1352
00:59:36,544 --> 00:59:38,145
You know me better
than anyone right now.

1353
00:59:38,179 --> 00:59:40,181
I asked you an hour ago
if you slept with her,

1354
00:59:40,214 --> 00:59:41,415
and you said no!

1355
00:59:41,448 --> 00:59:42,651
I didn't.

1356
00:59:42,683 --> 00:59:45,386
Only because he
couldn't get it up.

1357
00:59:45,419 --> 00:59:46,487
You're not helping!

1358
00:59:48,522 --> 00:59:50,324
No don't, you're a jerk.

1359
00:59:50,357 --> 00:59:53,327
Nikki, Nikki
please, I can explain.

1360
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,563
Oh yeah, explain it to me.

1361
00:59:55,596 --> 00:59:57,364
Lex, what the heck, man?

1362
00:59:57,398 --> 00:59:59,333
Daddy, I have
this under control.

1363
00:59:59,366 --> 01:00:00,267
Daddy!

1364
01:00:00,301 --> 01:00:01,969
Yeah, I'm her father, Jeff.

1365
01:00:02,002 --> 01:00:04,171
God, I wish you
hadn't done this.

1366
01:00:04,205 --> 01:00:05,739
Because now I'm gonna
have to hurt you.

1367
01:00:05,773 --> 01:00:07,875
Whoa, whoa, how is
she your daughter?

1368
01:00:07,908 --> 01:00:09,710
Because I banged her
mother, that's how.

1369
01:00:09,743 --> 01:00:11,912
I told you I had
family in Madison.

1370
01:00:11,946 --> 01:00:14,515
Your real name is Lana Lang?

1371
01:00:14,548 --> 01:00:15,749
Yeah, I told you that.

1372
01:00:15,783 --> 01:00:18,018
You told me you were
cosplaying as her.

1373
01:00:18,052 --> 01:00:19,386
Yeah, but it's
also my real name.

1374
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:21,255
Yeah, a name that you soiled.

1375
01:00:21,288 --> 01:00:23,290
Daddy, I never
should have told you.

1376
01:00:23,324 --> 01:00:24,592
What did you tell your daddy?

1377
01:00:24,626 --> 01:00:25,826
She tells me everything.

1378
01:00:25,859 --> 01:00:27,728
She said you tried
to seduce her.

1379
01:00:28,762 --> 01:00:30,097
How is that even possible?

1380
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:32,099
Oh, like it was that hard?

1381
01:00:32,132 --> 01:00:33,934
Now you're saying
my daughter's easy?

1382
01:00:33,968 --> 01:00:35,369
No Lex, but I mean, come on,

1383
01:00:35,402 --> 01:00:36,470
look at the way she's dressed.

1384
01:00:36,503 --> 01:00:37,905
She's till a teenager.

1385
01:00:37,938 --> 01:00:39,506
Which I found out
afterwards by the way,

1386
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:41,775
and technically 18
is legal, I checked.

1387
01:00:41,809 --> 01:00:44,545
Who do you think
you are, Kevin Spacey?

1388
01:00:44,578 --> 01:00:46,113
Nothing happened.

1389
01:00:46,146 --> 01:00:47,982
Kevin Spacey?

1390
01:00:48,015 --> 01:00:49,917
Look, we made out a little bit,

1391
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:52,721
and maybe I went to second
base, outside the costume,

1392
01:00:52,753 --> 01:00:54,288
and maybe I felt a
little something here.

1393
01:00:54,321 --> 01:00:56,323
So early detection,
that's a plus.

1394
01:00:56,357 --> 01:00:59,293
I'm gonna start by
breaking your fingers.

1395
01:00:59,326 --> 01:01:00,695
And if that doesn't
hit the spot,

1396
01:01:00,729 --> 01:01:02,664
then I'm gonna go for
the painful stuff.

1397
01:01:02,697 --> 01:01:05,399
Pliers, ice picks, whatever
I can find laying around.

1398
01:01:05,432 --> 01:01:06,601
Daddy, please don't hurt him.

1399
01:01:06,635 --> 01:01:08,135
Yes Daddy, please
don't hurt me.

1400
01:01:08,168 --> 01:01:10,271
Don't you call me Daddy,
you're older than I am.

1401
01:01:10,304 --> 01:01:11,606
And therefore
much more fragile,

1402
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:13,040
so take it easy Lex,

1403
01:01:13,073 --> 01:01:15,376
you're a mediation
teacher for Buddha's sake!

1404
01:01:15,409 --> 01:01:16,844
Daddy please, I love him.

1405
01:01:16,877 --> 01:01:18,713
Shut up!

1406
01:01:18,747 --> 01:01:20,948
Don't you tell my
daughter to shut up!

1407
01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:31,058
Hello,

1408
01:01:31,091 --> 01:01:34,895
hello, hello, hello,
hello, goodbye.

1409
01:02:02,222 --> 01:02:03,692
Hey have you seen
anybody come through here?

1410
01:02:03,725 --> 01:02:05,326
Will you sign my badge?

1411
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:06,160
Sure man.

1412
01:02:10,331 --> 01:02:11,198
So?

1413
01:02:11,231 --> 01:02:12,466
That way.

1414
01:02:12,499 --> 01:02:13,567
Thanks man.

1415
01:02:22,309 --> 01:02:23,712
Thanks kid.

1416
01:02:23,745 --> 01:02:25,245
Considering that I
got rid of Lex for you,

1417
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:26,580
mind signing my cross?

1418
01:02:27,548 --> 01:02:28,382
You know what?

1419
01:02:29,283 --> 01:02:30,685
I got a better deal for you.

1420
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:45,366
Cosplaying as myself.

1421
01:02:45,399 --> 01:02:46,900
I am a pathetic loser.

1422
01:02:55,777 --> 01:02:57,612
Hey, nice Wolfwood cosplay.

1423
01:02:57,645 --> 01:02:58,979
Thanks, Needle Noggins.

1424
01:03:01,281 --> 01:03:03,384
He even sounded like Wolfwood.

1425
01:03:25,372 --> 01:03:26,507
Hi guys.

1426
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:27,374
If,

1427
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:30,678
if you're here for the
voice acting workshop,

1428
01:03:30,712 --> 01:03:32,179
you're in the right place.

1429
01:03:32,212 --> 01:03:34,581
Why did you
come as Wolfwood?

1430
01:03:36,718 --> 01:03:40,053
Yeah, sometimes you just
want to be unrecognizable.

1431
01:03:41,922 --> 01:03:42,757
Anyway.

1432
01:03:44,324 --> 01:03:46,728
Tammy, tammy tammy tammy.

1433
01:03:46,761 --> 01:03:49,396
Jeff Nimoy is
cosplaying as Wolfwood.

1434
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:50,799
You've got to come with me.

1435
01:03:50,832 --> 01:03:52,966
Oh man, I have
got to see this.

1436
01:03:57,639 --> 01:03:59,173
So one of the things
about voice acting,

1437
01:03:59,206 --> 01:04:01,375
it's really important to
have a good microphone,

1438
01:04:01,408 --> 01:04:03,510
otherwise it could
really kill your voice.

1439
01:04:09,082 --> 01:04:10,785
Speaking of killing your voice,

1440
01:04:10,819 --> 01:04:12,252
I think I have a sore throat,

1441
01:04:12,286 --> 01:04:13,954
I gotta go, workshop canceled.

1442
01:04:25,667 --> 01:04:28,268
This isn't worth 3,000 dollars.

1443
01:05:07,709 --> 01:05:08,542
Okay.

1444
01:05:19,687 --> 01:05:20,889
Mike Leonardo.

1445
01:05:20,922 --> 01:05:22,724
Hey Mike, it's Jeff Nimoy.

1446
01:05:24,358 --> 01:05:25,459
Hello?

1447
01:05:25,492 --> 01:05:26,628
Jeff?

1448
01:05:26,661 --> 01:05:28,128
Yeah hi, you
asked me to call you

1449
01:05:28,161 --> 01:05:29,864
about "Best Beach Paradises?"

1450
01:05:29,898 --> 01:05:30,798
Yeah sorry, I'm trying

1451
01:05:30,832 --> 01:05:32,967
to get the kids out of the room.

1452
01:05:33,001 --> 01:05:33,902
Kids, huh?

1453
01:05:35,369 --> 01:05:36,804
Hey Jeff look,

1454
01:05:36,838 --> 01:05:38,305
I wanted to interview
you for the producer job,

1455
01:05:38,338 --> 01:05:40,474
but then I saw your age on
Wikepedia, and to be honest,

1456
01:05:40,507 --> 01:05:42,376
it's really a younger
man's job, man.

1457
01:05:43,443 --> 01:05:44,846
Well, I'll tell you Mike,

1458
01:05:44,879 --> 01:05:46,580
I can outwork any younger man,

1459
01:05:46,614 --> 01:05:49,383
plus you're getting
all my experience.

1460
01:05:49,416 --> 01:05:50,652
I know, I
know, but seriously,

1461
01:05:50,685 --> 01:05:51,886
you're too senior for this role.

1462
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:53,655
I'd be embarrassed
to offer it to you.

1463
01:05:53,688 --> 01:05:55,389
Don't be so embarrassed.

1464
01:05:55,422 --> 01:05:56,624
I've often taken
a lower position

1465
01:05:56,658 --> 01:06:00,929
just to prove myself to
the company, you know.

1466
01:06:00,962 --> 01:06:02,095
I'm sorry.

1467
01:06:02,129 --> 01:06:03,363
I hope you find
something really soon,

1468
01:06:03,397 --> 01:06:05,265
something that fits a
man with your resume.

1469
01:06:05,299 --> 01:06:06,634
Yeah, thanks.

1470
01:06:07,501 --> 01:06:08,468
Good luck, buddy.

1471
01:06:09,671 --> 01:06:11,906
Hey, if anything else
comes up in the future,

1472
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:13,507
please keep me in mind, okay.

1473
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:14,976
Yeah yeah
sure, take care.

1474
01:06:29,657 --> 01:06:31,158
Front desk,
how can I help you?

1475
01:06:31,191 --> 01:06:32,694
Nikki Boyer.

1476
01:06:33,795 --> 01:06:35,228
Hello?

1477
01:06:35,262 --> 01:06:37,564
Hey it's me, I just got
done with my phone interview.

1478
01:06:37,598 --> 01:06:39,333
Don't
ever call me again.

1479
01:06:54,916 --> 01:06:56,116
Room service.

1480
01:06:56,149 --> 01:06:58,452
Yeah could I order a
bottle of Jack Daniels,

1481
01:06:58,485 --> 01:06:59,988
and a bucket of ice?

1482
01:07:00,021 --> 01:07:01,521
One glass.

1483
01:07:01,555 --> 01:07:05,492
Well, we don't
actually give a whole bottle.

1484
01:07:05,525 --> 01:07:08,029
We can either do an
individual bottle,

1485
01:07:08,062 --> 01:07:11,866
or we can do a single drink
order, up to three drinks.

1486
01:07:11,899 --> 01:07:12,867
Would you like
something like that?

1487
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:14,702
No, I'll go down to the bar.

1488
01:07:14,736 --> 01:07:19,674
Thank you.

1489
01:07:46,868 --> 01:07:48,301
So ridiculous,

1490
01:07:48,335 --> 01:07:49,904
it's like hanging out
with a bunch of children.

1491
01:07:58,012 --> 01:07:58,980
Get undressed.

1492
01:08:00,081 --> 01:08:01,115
Oh yes ma'am.

1493
01:08:11,059 --> 01:08:12,727
Hey, shot of Jack.

1494
01:08:13,861 --> 01:08:15,295
Hey, food's
getting cold over here.

1495
01:08:15,328 --> 01:08:16,329
I'll be right back.

1496
01:08:20,034 --> 01:08:21,334
I'll be right back, too.

1497
01:08:44,391 --> 01:08:46,627
Mister Nimoy, can we
get a picture with you?

1498
01:08:46,661 --> 01:08:48,696
No, but you can
do a shot with me.

1499
01:08:48,730 --> 01:08:49,529
Who's in?

1500
01:08:49,563 --> 01:08:50,765
Yes.

1501
01:08:50,798 --> 01:08:51,899
All right, all
right, all right,

1502
01:08:51,933 --> 01:08:56,336
all right, all right, all right.

1503
01:08:56,369 --> 01:08:57,437
There you go.

1504
01:08:58,940 --> 01:08:59,841
All right.

1505
01:08:59,874 --> 01:09:01,475
Here's to adventures in anime.

1506
01:09:02,643 --> 01:09:03,477
Yeah.

1507
01:09:05,646 --> 01:09:06,580
You son of a bitch.

1508
01:09:06,614 --> 01:09:07,849
Get the fuck off me.

1509
01:09:07,882 --> 01:09:08,850
Hey what the hell?

1510
01:09:08,883 --> 01:09:09,717
Jesus.

1511
01:09:12,053 --> 01:09:12,854
Fuckin' asshole.

1512
01:09:12,887 --> 01:09:13,821
Save me Daddy.

1513
01:09:15,990 --> 01:09:18,092
Get back here
with my daughter.

1514
01:09:18,126 --> 01:09:20,161
I'm gonna War Greymon your ass!

1515
01:09:23,296 --> 01:09:26,033
What's up, Green Room?

1516
01:09:26,067 --> 01:09:26,868
What's up my man?

1517
01:09:26,901 --> 01:09:28,568
Mister Nimoy.

1518
01:09:28,603 --> 01:09:29,837
Club soda with lime?

1519
01:09:29,871 --> 01:09:31,239
No no, screw that.

1520
01:09:31,271 --> 01:09:33,340
You know how to
make a hurricane?

1521
01:09:33,373 --> 01:09:34,407
All right, screw that too.

1522
01:09:34,441 --> 01:09:35,676
Just give me Jack Daniels.

1523
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:36,611
All right.

1524
01:09:36,644 --> 01:09:38,846
That's what I'm talking about.

1525
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,081
No no no no.

1526
01:09:40,114 --> 01:09:42,750
I said, give me
the Jack Daniels.

1527
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:48,288
Whoa, that is epic,
just like Wolfwood.

1528
01:09:48,321 --> 01:09:49,724
Whoo!

1529
01:09:49,757 --> 01:09:51,358
Here you go kid, you
gotta be legal somewhere.

1530
01:09:53,961 --> 01:09:55,295
Oh, that's my girl.

1531
01:09:56,329 --> 01:09:57,799
Here you go buddy,

1532
01:09:57,832 --> 01:10:00,601
that's all the autograph
money I made this weekend.

1533
01:10:00,635 --> 01:10:01,969
Holy shit, no way.

1534
01:10:02,904 --> 01:10:04,105
Thanks, Mister Nimoy.

1535
01:11:36,097 --> 01:11:37,497
Oh Jesus.

1536
01:11:37,530 --> 01:11:38,366
Wake up.

1537
01:11:40,835 --> 01:11:43,671
Come on, time for you to go.

1538
01:11:44,939 --> 01:11:46,874
You have to wake up and go away.

1539
01:11:48,743 --> 01:11:49,911
Get out.

1540
01:11:49,944 --> 01:11:52,579
Hey, leave me alone now.

1541
01:11:52,613 --> 01:11:53,446
Go!

1542
01:11:55,616 --> 01:11:57,919
God, you are such an asshole!

1543
01:12:04,557 --> 01:12:06,794
The only reason I wanted
to hook up with you,

1544
01:12:06,827 --> 01:12:08,062
was to get back at my father,

1545
01:12:08,095 --> 01:12:10,164
for leaving me here
in Madison, all alone.

1546
01:12:11,399 --> 01:12:14,635
But you're just as
much of a selfish,

1547
01:12:14,669 --> 01:12:18,072
deadbeat, loser, as he is.

1548
01:12:19,307 --> 01:12:20,675
Fuck you, Wolfwood.

1549
01:12:36,857 --> 01:12:38,359
Hey, this
is Nikki Boyer.

1550
01:12:38,392 --> 01:12:40,094
Please leave me a message,
unless you're Jeff Nimoy,

1551
01:12:40,127 --> 01:12:42,630
in which case, you can
pretty much fuck off and die.

1552
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:11,192
Fuck.

1553
01:14:32,807 --> 01:14:33,607
Hello?

1554
01:14:33,641 --> 01:14:34,475
Jeff?

1555
01:14:35,409 --> 01:14:36,243
Jeff?

1556
01:14:37,344 --> 01:14:38,712
Hey, it's Robert.

1557
01:14:38,746 --> 01:14:41,382
Look, one of my story
producers on "House Flippers"

1558
01:14:41,415 --> 01:14:43,150
just got appendicitis.

1559
01:14:43,184 --> 01:14:45,585
I can get you approved because
it's a last minute thing.

1560
01:14:45,619 --> 01:14:46,520
Are you available?

1561
01:14:48,189 --> 01:14:49,156
Hello?

1562
01:14:49,190 --> 01:14:50,024
Hmm.

1563
01:14:50,891 --> 01:14:52,159
Where are you?

1564
01:14:53,527 --> 01:14:54,895
Madison.

1565
01:14:54,929 --> 01:14:56,596
What, Wisconsin?

1566
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:58,666
What are you doing there?

1567
01:14:58,699 --> 01:15:01,869
I'm at an anime convention.

1568
01:15:01,902 --> 01:15:03,204
Shit, can
you get back to LA?

1569
01:15:03,237 --> 01:15:04,872
I need you here
tomorrow morning?

1570
01:15:08,242 --> 01:15:09,743
This is a big opportunity.

1571
01:15:10,878 --> 01:15:13,180
Yeah, I'm leaving right now.

1572
01:15:13,214 --> 01:15:14,448
Okay.

1573
01:15:14,482 --> 01:15:15,783
This could be the break
you're looking for, man.

1574
01:15:15,816 --> 01:15:19,620
Be at my office
at nine a.m. okay?

1575
01:15:19,653 --> 01:15:21,722
Okay?

1576
01:15:21,755 --> 01:15:22,990
I'll be there.

1577
01:15:23,023 --> 01:15:24,225
Are you okay?

1578
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:29,196
Yeah, I just woke
up, that's all.

1579
01:15:29,230 --> 01:15:30,164
I wrote it down.

1580
01:15:31,932 --> 01:15:33,033
Okay.

1581
01:15:33,067 --> 01:15:33,968
I'll be there.

1582
01:15:34,001 --> 01:15:35,803
Sorry to wake you.

1583
01:15:35,836 --> 01:15:37,538
No, it's okay.

1584
01:15:37,571 --> 01:15:39,306
Okay, bye.

1585
01:15:40,908 --> 01:15:41,909
Thank you.

1586
01:15:51,685 --> 01:15:53,454
You're not gonna eat?

1587
01:15:53,487 --> 01:15:54,788
Mm-mm, I'm not hungry.

1588
01:15:54,822 --> 01:15:56,357
I thought for sure
after last night

1589
01:15:56,390 --> 01:15:58,559
you'd work up an appetite.

1590
01:15:59,994 --> 01:16:01,295
About last night, Brian.

1591
01:16:02,730 --> 01:16:03,764
Wasn't it great?

1592
01:16:04,932 --> 01:16:06,400
Actually I owe you an apology,

1593
01:16:06,433 --> 01:16:08,068
because last night
was less of a,

1594
01:16:08,102 --> 01:16:09,537
we're getting back
together, thing,

1595
01:16:09,570 --> 01:16:11,805
and more of a, revenge
against Jeff, thing.

1596
01:16:13,707 --> 01:16:15,176
Well,

1597
01:16:15,209 --> 01:16:16,777
I figured something would
change your mind about him.

1598
01:16:16,810 --> 01:16:18,445
I didn't want to spoil
the mood, you know,

1599
01:16:18,479 --> 01:16:19,614
make you come knocking.

1600
01:16:22,850 --> 01:16:24,218
You were right about him.

1601
01:16:25,219 --> 01:16:26,086
No shit, right?

1602
01:16:27,121 --> 01:16:28,322
What'd he do?

1603
01:16:28,355 --> 01:16:30,424
He lied about the girl
that he took upstairs.

1604
01:16:32,293 --> 01:16:33,127
What a dick.

1605
01:16:34,028 --> 01:16:35,262
When I was at the buffet,

1606
01:16:35,296 --> 01:16:36,964
I heard some fans
talking about him.

1607
01:16:36,997 --> 01:16:39,166
Apparently Jeff was parading
around the con last night,

1608
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:41,535
dressed like one
of his characters,

1609
01:16:41,569 --> 01:16:43,237
drunk off his ass.

1610
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:44,939
Oh no, really?

1611
01:16:44,972 --> 01:16:47,642
Yeah, one day he's telling
everyone he's changed,

1612
01:16:48,809 --> 01:16:50,578
but he's still the
same chain-smoking,

1613
01:16:50,612 --> 01:16:54,415
hard-drinking, womanizing
pedophile that he's always been.

1614
01:16:55,749 --> 01:16:57,484
Just like Wolfwood.

1615
01:16:57,518 --> 01:16:59,753
Exactly, typecasting.

1616
01:17:00,955 --> 01:17:02,624
I gotta make some
changes in my life.

1617
01:17:03,524 --> 01:17:04,659
What do you mean?

1618
01:17:04,693 --> 01:17:06,193
Look, I have a
history of doing this.

1619
01:17:06,227 --> 01:17:07,127
I meet these new guys,

1620
01:17:07,161 --> 01:17:08,329
and I fall in love with them

1621
01:17:08,362 --> 01:17:09,964
without knowing
anything about them.

1622
01:17:11,298 --> 01:17:13,100
Yeah, but you and
I weren't so bad,

1623
01:17:13,133 --> 01:17:14,468
and we could be good again.

1624
01:17:15,704 --> 01:17:17,905
Last night was pretty good.

1625
01:17:20,107 --> 01:17:23,377
Brian, we have to
take it slow, okay.

1626
01:17:24,545 --> 01:17:27,214
Take it as slow
as you want to.

1627
01:17:27,248 --> 01:17:28,617
- Oh my God.
- Excuse me Missus Boyer.

1628
01:17:28,650 --> 01:17:29,450
What do you want?

1629
01:17:29,483 --> 01:17:30,517
I just want you to know...

1630
01:17:30,551 --> 01:17:31,620
Would you both please go away.

1631
01:17:31,653 --> 01:17:33,153
Yeah, can't you see
that this isn't the time?

1632
01:17:33,187 --> 01:17:34,521
I just wanted to say,

1633
01:17:34,555 --> 01:17:36,590
I hope you and Jeff will
be very happy together.

1634
01:17:36,625 --> 01:17:37,758
Are you kidding me right now?

1635
01:17:37,791 --> 01:17:39,460
Will you please just go away?

1636
01:17:39,493 --> 01:17:40,861
You have nothing
to worry about,

1637
01:17:40,894 --> 01:17:43,197
I won't be interfering
anymore in your relationship.

1638
01:17:43,230 --> 01:17:45,065
Okay first of all, there
isn't a relationship,

1639
01:17:45,099 --> 01:17:46,333
and second of all,

1640
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:48,637
you and weird-out old
man pervert boyfriend,

1641
01:17:48,670 --> 01:17:52,339
can screw all the way till
junior high for all I care, go.

1642
01:17:52,373 --> 01:17:54,808
I told you, we
didn't have sex.

1643
01:17:54,842 --> 01:17:55,442
God.

1644
01:17:55,476 --> 01:17:56,477
He couldn't get it up.

1645
01:17:56,510 --> 01:17:57,945
Just stop, stop.

1646
01:17:57,978 --> 01:17:59,913
Okay, sorry.

1647
01:17:59,947 --> 01:18:01,650
Just wanted you to
know we never did it,

1648
01:18:01,683 --> 01:18:03,217
and we never will.

1649
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:04,653
I'm begging you at this point.

1650
01:18:04,686 --> 01:18:07,554
Could you please just go away?

1651
01:18:07,588 --> 01:18:09,056
You know, I
would have thought,

1652
01:18:09,089 --> 01:18:10,557
after he was so drunk last night

1653
01:18:10,591 --> 01:18:13,360
that he would have at least
like touched me, you know?

1654
01:18:14,561 --> 01:18:16,964
Wait, so you guys did
not have sex last night?

1655
01:18:16,997 --> 01:18:17,831
No.

1656
01:18:18,999 --> 01:18:20,968
And he was also crying,
whispering your name.

1657
01:18:22,303 --> 01:18:23,137
He did?

1658
01:18:25,472 --> 01:18:26,307
Pathetic.

1659
01:18:27,508 --> 01:18:28,342
How sweet.

1660
01:18:29,243 --> 01:18:30,477
He could have at least sighed

1661
01:18:30,511 --> 01:18:31,713
one of those morning sighs.

1662
01:18:31,746 --> 01:18:34,148
Oh okay, right,
we're done, bye.

1663
01:18:35,349 --> 01:18:38,118
You know, I told
him that I did it

1664
01:18:38,152 --> 01:18:39,987
just to get back at
my dad, but like,

1665
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:42,022
I think I really did like him.

1666
01:18:42,056 --> 01:18:45,459
You know like,
probably not love.

1667
01:18:46,894 --> 01:18:48,996
But I love the idea
of him, you know like,

1668
01:18:50,497 --> 01:18:51,733
a celebrity and all.

1669
01:18:56,638 --> 01:18:57,471
Sorry.

1670
01:18:58,372 --> 01:18:59,173
Okay.

1671
01:19:00,874 --> 01:19:01,776
Hold on.

1672
01:19:01,810 --> 01:19:03,110
If you didn't have sex with him,

1673
01:19:03,143 --> 01:19:04,845
then why did you
text me that you did?

1674
01:19:04,878 --> 01:19:06,480
Can you please go away,
you're upsetting Miss Boyer.

1675
01:19:06,513 --> 01:19:07,348
I never texted you.

1676
01:19:07,381 --> 01:19:08,248
I don't have your number.

1677
01:19:08,282 --> 01:19:09,383
You want me to get security?

1678
01:19:09,416 --> 01:19:10,217
No, it's fine.

1679
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:11,151
Yeah you did.

1680
01:19:11,185 --> 01:19:12,654
I actually have it right here.

1681
01:19:14,221 --> 01:19:15,589
I never sent that.

1682
01:19:15,623 --> 01:19:16,990
Aren't you Lana?

1683
01:19:17,024 --> 01:19:20,294
Yeah, and that's my number,
but I never sent that.

1684
01:19:20,327 --> 01:19:21,395
Why would I?

1685
01:19:21,428 --> 01:19:23,364
Yeah, weird.

1686
01:19:23,397 --> 01:19:25,199
Wait, what time was
that text message sent at?

1687
01:19:25,232 --> 01:19:26,300
Let me get a muffin.

1688
01:19:26,333 --> 01:19:27,935
Yesterday at 5:15 p.m.

1689
01:19:27,968 --> 01:19:29,403
Does anybody want me
to get them anything?

1690
01:19:29,436 --> 01:19:30,638
Wait, Mister Donovan,

1691
01:19:30,672 --> 01:19:33,708
isn't that when I left
my phone at your table?

1692
01:19:33,742 --> 01:19:34,676
You were so sweet.

1693
01:19:36,110 --> 01:19:38,212
I ran away crying, and he
held on to my phone for me.

1694
01:19:42,617 --> 01:19:45,653
Anyway, thanks for
coming to Madison.

1695
01:19:47,789 --> 01:19:48,589
Okay.

1696
01:19:48,623 --> 01:19:50,023
You're my favorite.

1697
01:19:50,057 --> 01:19:51,291
Okay, all right.

1698
01:19:51,325 --> 01:19:52,326
Okay.

1699
01:19:52,359 --> 01:19:53,160
Bye guys.

1700
01:19:53,193 --> 01:19:54,027
Bye.

1701
01:19:58,065 --> 01:19:59,066
More coffee?

1702
01:20:00,267 --> 01:20:01,101
I'll pour.

1703
01:20:05,072 --> 01:20:05,840
Mister Donovan?

1704
01:20:05,874 --> 01:20:06,841
Could we have a picture?

1705
01:20:09,309 --> 01:20:10,745
Thank you.

1706
01:20:10,779 --> 01:20:11,578
You now.

1707
01:20:11,613 --> 01:20:12,446
Me me.

1708
01:20:16,950 --> 01:20:18,018
- Thank you.
- Thanks,

1709
01:20:18,051 --> 01:20:19,119
thanks a lot.

1710
01:20:27,995 --> 01:20:28,929
10 please.

1711
01:20:33,233 --> 01:20:34,702
I like your costume.

1712
01:20:34,736 --> 01:20:38,071
Oh thanks, I was gonna cosplay
as Urahara from "Bleach."

1713
01:20:38,105 --> 01:20:39,674
but I couldn't
find the right hat.

1714
01:20:39,707 --> 01:20:40,909
I tried to dye
green streaks in it,

1715
01:20:40,941 --> 01:20:43,510
but then the whole
thing turned green,

1716
01:20:43,544 --> 01:20:45,446
so I went with Naruto instead.

1717
01:20:49,016 --> 01:20:49,983
Mister Nimoy?

1718
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:54,154
Mister Nimoy?

1719
01:20:56,390 --> 01:20:58,192
It's time for your
final autograph session.

1720
01:21:02,563 --> 01:21:05,767
Mister Nimoy?

1721
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:06,835
Mister Nimoy?

1722
01:21:20,615 --> 01:21:21,716
Mister Nimoy?

1723
01:21:26,821 --> 01:21:28,121
Hi Kyle, it's Bobbi.

1724
01:21:28,155 --> 01:21:29,691
I'm just up at
Mister Nimoy's room

1725
01:21:29,724 --> 01:21:31,391
to take him down for his
final autograph session,

1726
01:21:31,425 --> 01:21:32,861
and he's not answering the door,

1727
01:21:32,894 --> 01:21:34,696
and I called his phone
and I can hear it ringing

1728
01:21:34,729 --> 01:21:36,530
from inside his hotel room.

1729
01:21:36,563 --> 01:21:37,966
I'm here, I'm here.

1730
01:21:37,998 --> 01:21:39,500
Oh oh, he's here.

1731
01:21:39,533 --> 01:21:40,902
He's here, never mind.

1732
01:21:40,935 --> 01:21:42,236
Okay.

1733
01:21:42,269 --> 01:21:44,137
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear
you I was in the bathroom.

1734
01:21:44,171 --> 01:21:45,572
It's okay, I'm just here

1735
01:21:45,607 --> 01:21:47,341
to take you to your
final autograph session.

1736
01:21:47,374 --> 01:21:48,776
Just give me a minute, okay?

1737
01:21:48,810 --> 01:21:50,077
I'm sorry.

1738
01:21:50,110 --> 01:21:52,212
I just need a minute,
I woke up late.

1739
01:21:52,246 --> 01:21:53,080
Okay.

1740
01:21:54,616 --> 01:21:56,216
You have something.

1741
01:21:59,219 --> 01:22:00,020
You got it.

1742
01:22:01,555 --> 01:22:02,356
Okay?

1743
01:22:04,626 --> 01:22:05,660
I'll meet you downstairs.

1744
01:22:05,693 --> 01:22:07,528
Yeah, okay.

1745
01:22:07,561 --> 01:22:09,530
Call me if you need anything.

1746
01:22:16,436 --> 01:22:18,171
Hello, Mister Nimoy.

1747
01:22:18,205 --> 01:22:19,139
My name is Ryan,

1748
01:22:19,172 --> 01:22:20,440
and I just wanted to say

1749
01:22:20,474 --> 01:22:23,076
what an extreme pleasure
it is to meet you,

1750
01:22:23,110 --> 01:22:26,915
and I came all the way from
Kenosha to shake your hand.

1751
01:22:29,751 --> 01:22:32,921
Ryan, no offense but,

1752
01:22:34,087 --> 01:22:36,290
I've been shaking a lot
of hands this weekend,

1753
01:22:37,659 --> 01:22:40,929
and I think I might be coming
down with something so,

1754
01:22:41,796 --> 01:22:42,964
what I'm trying to say is,

1755
01:22:42,997 --> 01:22:44,766
I think I'm done shaking
hands this weekend.

1756
01:22:44,799 --> 01:22:45,800
No offense.

1757
01:22:48,670 --> 01:22:50,605
Perfectly understandable sir,

1758
01:22:50,638 --> 01:22:53,106
but please allow me
to give you this.

1759
01:22:53,975 --> 01:22:55,075
You want me to sign this?

1760
01:22:55,108 --> 01:22:58,846
No, that is my mother.

1761
01:22:59,881 --> 01:23:01,515
You want me to
sign it for her.

1762
01:23:01,548 --> 01:23:04,652
No no, I brought
it to you as a gift.

1763
01:23:06,153 --> 01:23:08,455
You brought me a photo
of your mother as a gift?

1764
01:23:08,488 --> 01:23:09,289
Yes sir.

1765
01:23:10,825 --> 01:23:13,527
Thanks, I'll cherish it.

1766
01:23:14,729 --> 01:23:18,866
Well she recently
had stage four cancer,

1767
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:21,468
and while she was
undergoing chemo,

1768
01:23:21,501 --> 01:23:26,273
we would sit and watch
episodes of Trigun together.

1769
01:23:27,407 --> 01:23:29,811
Wolfwood was her
favorite character,

1770
01:23:29,844 --> 01:23:32,046
both of ours actually.

1771
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:34,849
It was really the
only bright spot

1772
01:23:34,882 --> 01:23:37,217
of either of our days,

1773
01:23:37,250 --> 01:23:40,655
sitting watching
Trigun together.

1774
01:23:41,823 --> 01:23:44,859
When we heard you were
coming to Madison,

1775
01:23:44,892 --> 01:23:47,160
she told me she was
going to get well enough

1776
01:23:47,194 --> 01:23:49,162
to get up out of her sick bed

1777
01:23:49,196 --> 01:23:52,900
so that we could come here
and meet you together.

1778
01:23:54,736 --> 01:23:58,106
So she was too
sick to come, huh?

1779
01:23:58,138 --> 01:24:02,142
No sir, unfortunately she
passed away a few days ago.

1780
01:24:04,211 --> 01:24:06,848
But I wanted to bring
you a picture of her.

1781
01:24:06,881 --> 01:24:10,852
That way it was like she
got to meet you after all.

1782
01:24:12,519 --> 01:24:14,822
So thank you, Mister Nimoy,

1783
01:24:14,856 --> 01:24:17,491
for everything you've
done to entertain,

1784
01:24:17,524 --> 01:24:19,661
not only me and my mother,

1785
01:24:19,694 --> 01:24:22,462
but millions around the world.

1786
01:24:26,701 --> 01:24:27,534
Kid,

1787
01:24:30,672 --> 01:24:32,640
I'm just a lousy voice actor,

1788
01:24:33,941 --> 01:24:35,677
and I'm a hack
writer and director.

1789
01:24:37,277 --> 01:24:38,311
I didn't do anything.

1790
01:24:41,248 --> 01:24:42,850
But of course you did.

1791
01:24:44,351 --> 01:24:45,285
No, kid.

1792
01:24:46,586 --> 01:24:49,624
If it wasn't me it would
have been somebody else.

1793
01:24:49,657 --> 01:24:51,759
But it was you,

1794
01:24:51,793 --> 01:24:54,829
and you put your stamp on it.

1795
01:24:54,862 --> 01:24:56,898
And we love it.

1796
01:24:58,800 --> 01:24:59,901
We love you.

1797
01:25:03,971 --> 01:25:05,640
So I can keep this?

1798
01:25:05,673 --> 01:25:06,506
Yes.

1799
01:25:08,810 --> 01:25:09,711
I'll cherish it.

1800
01:25:12,814 --> 01:25:14,314
Mister Nimoy, I know you said

1801
01:25:14,347 --> 01:25:17,451
you weren't giving out any
more handshakes or hugs,

1802
01:25:17,484 --> 01:25:20,021
and I am kicking myself
I did not get here

1803
01:25:20,054 --> 01:25:21,823
a day earlier when
you still were,

1804
01:25:21,856 --> 01:25:24,025
but the funeral was yesterday,

1805
01:25:24,058 --> 01:25:26,861
and I was wondering if
maybe I put a glove on,

1806
01:25:26,894 --> 01:25:27,762
if you would...

1807
01:25:27,795 --> 01:25:28,930
It's okay, it's okay.

1808
01:25:31,099 --> 01:25:31,933
It's okay.

1809
01:25:41,408 --> 01:25:44,078
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

1810
01:25:49,817 --> 01:25:51,619
Thank you sir.

1811
01:25:55,857 --> 01:25:58,192
You guys, I have time
for one more question

1812
01:25:58,226 --> 01:26:00,260
before I head to the airport.

1813
01:26:00,293 --> 01:26:02,029
Let's see.

1814
01:26:02,063 --> 01:26:03,731
I have a question.

1815
01:26:09,203 --> 01:26:11,304
Please, just one question.

1816
01:26:11,338 --> 01:26:12,707
Jeff, not here.

1817
01:26:12,740 --> 01:26:14,242
Well, you're not
answering any of my calls,

1818
01:26:14,274 --> 01:26:17,678
so you have to answer
me now, you're stuck.

1819
01:26:17,712 --> 01:26:19,614
Please, just one question.

1820
01:26:19,647 --> 01:26:21,082
What's the question?

1821
01:26:21,115 --> 01:26:22,083
Okay well,

1822
01:26:22,917 --> 01:26:24,185
didn't realize until now

1823
01:26:24,218 --> 01:26:25,920
I'd have to do this
in front of everybody,

1824
01:26:25,953 --> 01:26:28,455
but okay it is what it is.

1825
01:26:30,258 --> 01:26:31,092
I'm sorry.

1826
01:26:32,292 --> 01:26:33,527
I'm sorry for everything.

1827
01:26:34,896 --> 01:26:38,532
But I'm especially sorry
that I bent the truth,

1828
01:26:38,565 --> 01:26:41,135
but Nikki, it was the truth.

1829
01:26:41,169 --> 01:26:42,637
I didn't sleep with her.

1830
01:26:42,670 --> 01:26:45,372
I did want to, but
I didn't do it.

1831
01:26:45,405 --> 01:26:46,641
For God's sake Jeff.

1832
01:26:46,674 --> 01:26:48,943
Please just hear me out.

1833
01:26:48,976 --> 01:26:53,480
I couldn't, for lack
of a better term,

1834
01:26:55,082 --> 01:26:55,983
perform.

1835
01:26:56,017 --> 01:26:59,086
Oh shit yeah, limp dick.

1836
01:27:03,925 --> 01:27:05,559
The point is,

1837
01:27:07,995 --> 01:27:12,033
I couldn't do with her or
anyone for almost 10 years.

1838
01:27:12,066 --> 01:27:13,901
But with you, I had no problem.

1839
01:27:20,274 --> 01:27:22,475
Look, I've been stripped
down to raw honesty,

1840
01:27:22,509 --> 01:27:26,914
and I can't do it with
any girl that's not real,

1841
01:27:26,948 --> 01:27:29,250
and with you Nikki, it was real.

1842
01:27:33,221 --> 01:27:34,922
Hey look, I'm not
oblivious to my reputation,

1843
01:27:34,956 --> 01:27:36,057
I know what people say about me,

1844
01:27:36,090 --> 01:27:38,726
that I screw fangirls
at every con.

1845
01:27:38,759 --> 01:27:39,827
That's probably why
I haven't gotten

1846
01:27:39,861 --> 01:27:41,561
invited anywhere for so long.

1847
01:27:41,595 --> 01:27:45,800
But I'm older now, and
I'm trying to be better.

1848
01:27:45,833 --> 01:27:48,936
I'm a work in progress,
like everyone else.

1849
01:27:48,970 --> 01:27:51,504
I mean, I'm working it out.

1850
01:27:51,538 --> 01:27:53,341
Do you have
everything worked out?

1851
01:27:56,711 --> 01:27:57,879
What's your question?

1852
01:28:00,281 --> 01:28:01,716
Will you please forgive me?

1853
01:28:07,788 --> 01:28:10,691
Thank you guys so much for
being here, I'm so grateful.

1854
01:28:10,725 --> 01:28:12,392
I will see you next year.

1855
01:28:12,425 --> 01:28:13,728
You guys take care, okay?

1856
01:28:25,072 --> 01:28:25,907
So?

1857
01:28:28,709 --> 01:28:31,511
So, how did the
phone interview go?

1858
01:28:32,545 --> 01:28:33,381
Not good.

1859
01:28:36,384 --> 01:28:37,885
Well, it could
be a good thing,

1860
01:28:37,919 --> 01:28:39,419
'cause I reached out
to the booking agent

1861
01:28:39,452 --> 01:28:40,688
for the Digimon tour,

1862
01:28:40,721 --> 01:28:42,189
and she reached out to
the people in Denver,

1863
01:28:42,223 --> 01:28:44,125
at the anime convention.

1864
01:28:44,158 --> 01:28:46,227
They're dying to have you.

1865
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:47,962
And they can give
you a few grand,

1866
01:28:47,995 --> 01:28:48,896
for this one,

1867
01:28:48,930 --> 01:28:52,033
and maybe more for other cities.

1868
01:28:54,235 --> 01:28:56,604
You did all that for me?

1869
01:28:56,637 --> 01:28:57,805
Yeah, I did.

1870
01:28:59,707 --> 01:29:01,375
So you forgive me?

1871
01:29:03,244 --> 01:29:05,613
You really shouldn't have
been with a girl that young.

1872
01:29:05,646 --> 01:29:07,148
I know.

1873
01:29:07,181 --> 01:29:09,549
This whole place,
it's an ego trip.

1874
01:29:11,686 --> 01:29:12,687
I'm flawed, Nikki.

1875
01:29:14,622 --> 01:29:15,823
The problem is, is that

1876
01:29:16,757 --> 01:29:18,525
I fall in love too quickly.

1877
01:29:19,526 --> 01:29:20,661
And you fall for people

1878
01:29:20,695 --> 01:29:22,363
who fall in love
with you too quickly.

1879
01:29:25,299 --> 01:29:26,434
You know I didn't
tell you everything

1880
01:29:26,466 --> 01:29:27,802
about the first time we met.

1881
01:29:28,970 --> 01:29:32,006
I actually asked you a
question at your panel.

1882
01:29:33,473 --> 01:29:36,077
I said, so how do you break
into the voiceover industry?

1883
01:29:38,145 --> 01:29:39,546
You know what you said?

1884
01:29:40,881 --> 01:29:42,083
Probably what I tell everybody

1885
01:29:42,116 --> 01:29:43,516
at these conventions, right?

1886
01:29:44,385 --> 01:29:46,354
You gotta go where the work is,

1887
01:29:46,387 --> 01:29:48,155
and no one's hiring
in Saint Louis,

1888
01:29:49,256 --> 01:29:50,424
and you gotta go to LA.

1889
01:29:51,726 --> 01:29:53,361
And that is
exactly what I did.

1890
01:29:54,561 --> 01:29:57,597
And I went from being
a fan who attends cons,

1891
01:29:57,631 --> 01:30:00,001
to a VIP guest at cons,

1892
01:30:00,034 --> 01:30:02,837
and that wouldn't have
happened if it wasn't for you.

1893
01:30:06,741 --> 01:30:07,574
You matter.

1894
01:30:10,711 --> 01:30:13,714
So, do I forgive you?

1895
01:30:15,182 --> 01:30:15,983
Yes.

1896
01:30:17,718 --> 01:30:20,755
But, we need to
start from scratch.

1897
01:30:20,788 --> 01:30:22,790
You know, get to know
each other slowly.

1898
01:30:23,724 --> 01:30:25,626
Work out our flaws,

1899
01:30:25,659 --> 01:30:28,362
if this is gonna work out.

1900
01:30:28,396 --> 01:30:29,964
That sounds good.

1901
01:30:30,831 --> 01:30:32,500
So are you coming to Denver?

1902
01:30:35,903 --> 01:30:37,238
There's a slight wrinkle.

1903
01:30:38,372 --> 01:30:40,808
What?

1904
01:30:40,841 --> 01:30:44,078
My brother-in-law finally
came through with a job.

1905
01:30:44,111 --> 01:30:45,646
But it starts tomorrow,

1906
01:30:46,579 --> 01:30:47,415
in LA.

1907
01:30:50,451 --> 01:30:51,285
Well,

1908
01:30:54,121 --> 01:30:56,657
I guess it comes down to
what you want out of life.

1909
01:30:58,426 --> 01:30:59,393
But either way,

1910
01:31:03,397 --> 01:31:04,698
you gotta go where the work is.

1911
01:31:17,878 --> 01:31:18,746
We're good now.

1912
01:31:19,613 --> 01:31:22,016
Don't do it again, all right?

1913
01:32:34,623 --> 01:32:35,890
- I'll see ya.
- Yeah.

1914
01:32:35,923 --> 01:32:37,424
I'll see you tomorrow.

1915
01:32:37,458 --> 01:32:38,859
First thing in the morning.

1916
01:32:38,893 --> 01:32:40,694
Less chipper than
that tomorrow morning

1917
01:32:40,728 --> 01:32:41,562
- Okay.
- Okay.

1918
01:32:50,471 --> 01:32:51,705
It was Arnold Schwarzenegger

1919
01:32:51,739 --> 01:32:53,642
as like the ringmaster
of the circus, right?

1920
01:32:53,674 --> 01:32:54,909
Ladies and gentlemen,

1921
01:32:54,942 --> 01:32:58,245
this next poodle
dances and sings.

1922
01:33:09,523 --> 01:33:11,692
Is there anything
I can do for you,

1923
01:33:11,725 --> 01:33:13,561
because you seem
to be loitering?

1924
01:33:23,771 --> 01:33:26,373
Well we never said anything
about my room tonight.

1925
01:33:27,741 --> 01:33:28,742
My room tonight.

1926
01:33:54,802 --> 01:33:56,003
See you in the morning.

1927
01:33:56,036 --> 01:33:56,837
Okay, goodbye.

1928
01:33:56,870 --> 01:33:57,504
Okay bye.

1929
01:33:57,538 --> 01:33:58,707
You have a room too, right?

1930
01:33:58,739 --> 01:33:59,573
Yeah, right next door.

1931
01:34:00,741 --> 01:34:01,542
Great.

1932
01:34:01,575 --> 01:34:02,409
Mm-hmm.

1933
01:34:35,175 --> 01:34:37,177
It was Arnold Schwarzenegger
as a brain surgeon.

1934
01:34:37,211 --> 01:34:38,912
Oh yeah, I could
put down the scalpel,

1935
01:34:38,946 --> 01:34:41,015
and he said, he's the nurse.

1936
01:34:41,048 --> 01:34:41,915
Here's a toomer.

1937
01:34:55,930 --> 01:34:56,851
