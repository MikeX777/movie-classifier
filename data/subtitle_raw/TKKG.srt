1
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:49,675
- Hey! The cops are coming!
- Shit!

2
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,179
Tim!

3
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:04,648
Fuck.

4
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:09,903
Well, my friend.

5
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,115
Hey! Hey!

6
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:20,205
Stop!

7
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,502
Damn it!

8
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:35,304
- Stop!
- Wait!

9
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:37,389
Stop!

10
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,647
Hey!

11
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,357
Kid!

12
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,238
Do you have a death wish?

13
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:58,160
Enjoy your meal.

14
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,703
Call the police.

15
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,789
Good day.

16
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,837
Hey!

17
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,263
Wait!

18
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:23,810
Hey, kid!

19
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,481
Stay where you are!

20
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,444
Damn it.

21
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,001
Have a good day. Bye.

22
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,336
<i>Hey, Mom.</i>

23
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,883
Hey. I went by your school today.

24
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,469
Unlike you.

25
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:01,264
- I had to...
- Congratulations.

26
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,644
- You won the national math test!
- Really? Cool!

27
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,730
Your father would be
so proud of you, and so am I.

28
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,440
Come here.

29
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,278
Look.

30
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:21,618
Your teacher Kalmuczak
nominated you for a scholarship.

31
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,579
- And guess what? They accepted you.
- Really?

32
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:28,083
And the best part is
that you can no longer skip class.

33
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,379
You'll be living in the school.

34
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:38,135
- I don't know anyone there.
- But you'll meet lots of nice new folks.

35
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,099
Boarding school.

36
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,498
Bright blue sky. It's almost like Nice.

37
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,876
But with school instead of the sea.

38
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:14,796
Come on, now. I'm sure
it'll work out this time. You'll see.

39
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:30,520
So? How much did my dad have to fork out
in order to get me accepted here?

40
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,022
A new library?

41
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:36,902
Indeed. As well as a new sports stadium,
swimming pool included.

42
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:41,740
- Really?
- Yes. And a cruise for all the teachers.

43
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,336
Excuse me. This is room 53.

44
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,755
It is indeed.

45
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:02,177
There must've been a misunderstanding.
It's my room.

46
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:03,637
Okay.

47
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,680
It's mine, too.

48
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:08,600
A double room?

49
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,648
My dad really hates me.

50
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,529
He doesn't mean it like that.

51
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,698
A double room with a sneaker-wearer.

52
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:27,953
Give him a chance. He's got
a big heart, but it takes time to...

53
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:29,287
discover it.

54
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:33,041
And I thought the school in Piedmont
was as bad as it could get.

55
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:37,295
- Hey. Everything will be fine.
- Could you stay a while?

56
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:41,842
I have to fly to Geneva tomorrow morning
for your father. Don't be sad.

57
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,678
I'll go to the Rollberg
confectionery store

58
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:50,433
and I'll send you the lemon souffle'
macaron cake with the butter crust.

59
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:54,563
Express delivery. Promise. Come here.

60
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,779
Bye. Take care, Kookie.

61
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:12,205
- Kookie?
- No! Only my friends call me that.

62
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,999
Okay then.

63
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:17,335
- I'm sure you have loads of friends.
- Yes, I do.

64
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,798
But only my very close friends.
A few chosen ones.

65
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:26,678
They call me that.

66
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:28,680
- Kookie?
- Yes, Kookie.

67
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,603
Kookie.

68
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:44,404
- Why don't you like sneakers?
- They're fine for sports.

69
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,740
But I never do sports.

70
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,745
- Super brain. Did you do our homework?
- I did.

71
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:55,415
Great. I mean, were we really
meant to work during the break?

72
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,043
- At least you had something to do.
- Hey!

73
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,503
Are you too stupid to do it yourselves?

74
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:18,897
- Are you the ghetto scholarship student?
- Yes. So what?

75
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:23,109
Hey! Check this out! It's from the museum.

76
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,154
Say, what? Let me see it.

77
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,283
Doesn't he have a cell phone?

78
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,454
Hey! Check it out. It's from the '80s.

79
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,582
It's a Walkman.

80
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,294
- Look at this.
- Just give it back.

81
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,049
And what if I don't?

82
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,222
Why are you acting like Tarzan?

83
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:57,185
- It seems to be important to you.
- Stay out of it.

84
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,813
What's going on here?

85
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:06,194
You seem to fit in well here.

86
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,656
So, nothing's going on here. As you were.

87
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,158
You two, come with me.

88
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,870
I'll take you to Mr. Pauling.
He's in charge of the boarders.

89
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:22,252
I'm Ms. MÃ¼ller-Borello.
I'm the director of this institution.

90
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:26,631
When it comes to Mil-Bo...
And you didn't hear that name from me...

91
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,758
You can't joke around with her.

92
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:32,679
Chemistry, chemistry.
So, do you have any questions?

93
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,682
At breakfast, I like my egg
cooked for 3.5 minutes.

94
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:41,021
None of my food should contain
even the slightest trace of avocado.

95
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,440
It gives me extreme flatulence.

96
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,943
- Okay.
- I usually bring my own dessert.

97
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:51,197
Very well. Okay. That's all
I'll be taking care of from now on.

98
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,993
And there's been a mix-up with the room.
I'm sure I have a single.

99
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,788
I'm afraid you don't.
I put you both together on purpose.

100
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,041
Here. Math.

101
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:05,628
You know... I think you could both
benefit from each other.

102
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,798
Tim seems to have
a slight temper problem,

103
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,260
but he's here due to his performance.

104
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:13,762
Nerd.

105
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:16,890
In your case, we had our doubts.

106
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,142
It's your fifth school, isn't it?

107
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:23,855
Fourth. I was kicked out of the third
school before I'd even started there.

108
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,900
Oh, really? That makes a huge difference.

109
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,985
- Yes.
- In any case...

110
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:33,281
Your parents fought tooth and nail
to get you here, which impressed me.

111
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:36,576
As did your father's art collection.
It's impressive.

112
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:42,540
He even promised to lend us
some of his exhibits for art class,

113
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,668
which will positively
influence your grades.

114
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,046
- Really?
- Dream on.

115
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:52,217
Come to me if you have any problems, okay?

116
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:55,678
Okay. Now, shake hands.

117
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,806
To being new roommates.

118
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,393
See? There you go.

119
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:22,455
"Dear Mom. I have..."

120
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,957
Hey!

121
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:30,630
Sorry. I don't have a phone.
I just wanted to send my Mom a message.

122
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,632
- Of course.
- Where are you going?

123
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,593
Where else?
To tell them you stole my phone.

124
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:37,345
Man, no!

125
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,639
You going to hit me, too?

126
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:48,857
Wow.

127
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,859
What is that?

128
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,945
Did someone jump out of it?

129
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,698
We have to go check it out.

130
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,868
If it's newsworthy,
it'll be online tomorrow.

131
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,871
Do you want to read about others
or be the hero?

132
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,000
Come on, then.

133
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:12,505
Damn.

134
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,843
You're crazier than I thought.

135
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:35,153
- Don't you want to know what's there?
- No. I don't.

136
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,323
If I ever gave you
the impression that I'm brave,

137
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,867
I thought "Shaun the Sheep" was scary.

138
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:44,829
We need to get closer.

139
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:49,459
That's the last thing that's said
in horror films before they all die.

140
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,669
What happens to those who stay behind?

141
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,717
Uhm... Wait.

142
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:08,978
Dude.

143
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:11,397
SAUERLICH'S BEST

144
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,358
That's our plane.

145
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,361
'Georg! "Willy!"

146
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,197
Willy, wait!

147
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,825
"Willy! 'Georg!"

148
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,327
Willy, wait!

149
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,419
- Get away from there.
- Damn it.

150
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,005
Georg jumped out. We saw it.

151
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,561
- Mr. Glockner.
- Stay here until we know more.

152
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,021
- No!
- Yes.

153
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:56,317
That's enough.
We have to cordon off a larger area.

154
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,361
We know her.

155
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,822
Cool. Has she been arrested?

156
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,075
Dad, your radio.

157
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,286
It was a plane crash.

158
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,163
Glockner here.
Are forensics on their way?

159
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,708
Tell them to hurry.

160
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,721
Damn it.

161
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:28,850
Who's there?
Show yourselves, at once! Police.

162
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,855
We've got gawkers! Secure the area!

163
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:36,190
It's okay. It's okay.

164
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:38,693
- Not so loud.
- What's going on?

165
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,446
You should be in the car.

166
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,532
- Are they your friends?
- No.

167
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,618
Did you witness the crash?

168
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:51,998
Yes, but from the boarding school.
It was all over when we got here.

169
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:55,626
It's my parents' plane.
I'm Willy Sauerlich.

170
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:57,670
I can represent my family.

171
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,632
What's the current state
of the investigation?

172
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:04,218
Any sign of the pilot?

173
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,638
<i>Bienert to Glockner.
We've found the black box.</i>

174
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:11,476
I'll be right there.
Stay behind the cordon.

175
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:14,354
I'm curious about
the data in the black box.

176
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,855
Keep an eye on them.

177
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,900
- No!
- So they don't do anything stupid.

178
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,234
'Stupid?

179
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,071
- Bienert to Glockner.
- Thanks a lot.

180
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:24,572
I'm coming!

181
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:29,535
Hey... What statue
where they transporting?

182
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,747
- You know about the Heaven's Guard?
- Police radio.

183
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,500
What's the Heaven's Guardian... Guard?

184
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,087
My father brought it back from Asia.

185
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,422
It must be worth a fortune.

186
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,008
A statue made of pure gold.

187
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:47,178
What is he doing?

188
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,097
Is he hunting for aliens?

189
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,432
- Is that a metal detector?
- The statue!

190
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:55,186
- Let's go.
- Forget it. I'm keeping an eye on you.

191
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:57,146
You can do that on the way.

192
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,236
Hello?

193
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,029
Hello?

194
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:48,781
Karl?

195
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:03,504
The core of the Heaven's Guard
is made of .999 fine gold.

196
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,923
This locates items with specific alloys

197
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:09,969
through balance induction,
so, by sending asynchronous pulses.

198
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,054
Gold percentage: 87.3%.

199
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:16,100
So, do you mean
that the statue might be in there?

200
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,853
- Yes.
- Let's go inside then.

201
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:20,980
Come on.

202
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,051
What is that?

203
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,803
There's a ladder leading down.

204
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:57,058
- Is it coming from down there?
- Yes.

205
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,440
Hey!

206
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,526
- Watch out.
- Be careful.

207
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,702
Tim?

208
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,746
Tim?

209
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:24,085
I think I found something.
Looks like a parachute.

210
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:26,254
I told you Georg jumped out.

211
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,547
- What?
- Georg!

212
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,632
Come on down.

213
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,593
That means Georg survived.

214
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,012
Don't touch anything.

215
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,933
- Don't leave any fingerprints.
- Over here.

216
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,397
- It's the casket! Open it.
- Yes.

217
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,649
No. Stop. Let me do it.

218
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,245
The treasure.

219
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:14,677
- Why is it empty?
- It's obvious.

220
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:18,431
This is probably what happened:
Georg jumped out,

221
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:21,392
left his parachute and the casket here

222
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:24,854
and ran off with the statue.

223
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:29,609
- Where did he take the statue?
- You're not that bright, are you?

224
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:33,779
- He stole it.
- Are you crazy? You're not that bright.

225
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,325
Georg would never
steal from us, unlike you.

226
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:45,750
It was actually a job for the police,
but thank you.

227
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,961
And things might not be so bad after all.

228
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:52,506
- What do you mean?
- Your dad will tell you.

229
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:56,010
- You'll take the casket to him.
- Not with Mr. Sneakers!

230
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:57,595
- No way.
- I'm staying.

231
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:01,432
You're going. The Sauerlichs
will take you back to the school.

232
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,644
- Come on, then.
- That's just stupid.

233
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:09,315
I'd send Bienert,
but he even gets lost in a car wash.

234
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,484
- Okay.
- Thanks, partner.

235
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,236
In the car wash?

236
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,365
Yes. Go to the car wash.

237
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:23,871
Wait!

238
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,414
Wait!

239
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,376
Take me with you!

240
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,752
Wait!

241
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:35,257
Hey! Please, wait!

242
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,641
Awesome. This is where he lives?

243
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,696
Welcome. Mr. Sauerlich is expecting you.

244
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,832
- Hello, Willy.
- Hello, Ms. Mauser.

245
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,333
This looks valuable.

246
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:14,547
Forget it. The glass is bulletproof.

247
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,050
The Heaven's Guard was displayed there.

248
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:27,518
Don't they all belong in Asia?
I mean... What do you want them for?

249
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:31,147
They're better than stocks, nowadays.
Congratulations.

250
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:35,109
Here's your casket.
You need to sign here, please.

251
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:39,697
- What about the plane?
- It's a write-off.

252
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,700
- Georg will pay for the damages.
- He didn't do it!

253
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,910
You bet he did. I set a trap.

254
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:48,622
It wasn't the real Heaven's Guard.
It was a replica.

255
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:51,167
- What?
- I've suspected him for ages.

256
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,044
The alarm here kept going off.

257
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:58,174
Then I sent him to Geneva with a replica
to see what would happen.

258
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,217
And, barn! He runs away.

259
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:03,220
Nonsense! Where's Mom?

260
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:06,682
Mom? She's still having her...

261
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:09,477
- Energy session.
- Mom?

262
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:12,354
- Don't go up there. You know...
- Mom?

263
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,360
Who dares disrupt our circle?

264
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,238
Hi, Raimondo. Where's Mom?

265
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,742
Give her all the time she needs.

266
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:41,801
My hero.

267
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,595
Mgrâ!

268
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:49,725
I was so worried. Are you really okay?

269
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:54,146
- Georg has disappeared.
- Disappeared? He ran off!

270
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:57,107
I sense some really negative energy.

271
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:03,030
- Come. Let's get rid of that bad energy.
- Darling, don't...

272
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,210
How wonderful.

273
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:23,300
It's so great to meet Wilhelm's friends.

274
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,136
Yeah, I'd like to meet them, too.

275
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:28,472
Your friends are just wonderful.

276
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,018
Stay!

277
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:35,938
- Who are you, then?
- Oskar!

278
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:39,650
Master. You can retire now.

279
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:43,237
I've soaked up
enough energy for today. Thank you.

280
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:46,866
Bless you.

281
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:51,412
I haven't sat behind the wheel for ages.

282
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,624
Where's the...

283
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,379
You know your way around the car.

284
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,464
Georg showed me.

285
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,264
Did he win his driver's license or what?

286
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,146
Hello?

287
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,360
Hello?

288
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,159
Hey!

289
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:38,918
- Hey!
- Dad!

290
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,814
What kind of technique is that?

291
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:46,360
Dad was the youngest inspector
of all times. He knows what he's doing.

292
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:47,569
Sure he does.

293
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:49,905
Diesel.

294
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:53,575
Note it down and put out
an APB on the license plate.

295
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:57,663
- "APB on the license plate."
- Wait a minute

296
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:03,168
- Could you describe the fight?
- "Describe fight."

297
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:07,172
As I said,
the smallest one was really spot on.

298
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:09,842
- In what way?
- I was stronger than him.

299
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:14,763
It was as though I had too much power,
not too little. Know what I mean?

300
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:18,642
- That's your problem in general.
- "Problem in general."

301
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:21,895
- But to name a few.
- "But to name a few."

302
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:27,568
Martial arts. It could be a martial art.

303
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:35,576
Well done. Note down "martial arts".

304
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:38,912
"Martial arts, note down."

305
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:06,356
I'm sure you've all heard
about the plane crash

306
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:10,569
and the missing statue in the news, right?

307
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:14,406
Seeing as a particularly interested pupil
asked me about it,

308
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:19,912
we'll be going on a historical excursion
to see the Shaolong's Heaven's Guard.

309
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:27,753
The Shaolong Monastery on the foot
of Mount Songshan in the heart of China.

310
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:32,716
Vaishravana, the Heaven's Guard.

311
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,469
Shaolong's most sacred object.

312
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,431
It watched over those who meditated

313
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:43,685
and was worshipped as
the protector of Buddhist teachings,

314
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,730
until it disappeared in 1928.

315
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,986
It reappeared at an auction in the '60s

316
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:57,825
and was sold for twelve million dollars.
A record sum at the time.

317
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:01,245
- Yes, Tim?
- What exactly are those monks doing?

318
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:04,957
As far as I know, in order to meditate
for long amounts of time,

319
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:08,710
they practiced specific
breathing techniques and movements.

320
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:12,589
That then developed into
a defensive way of fighting.

321
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:16,468
Of course you'd be interested in that.
Right in the kisser.

322
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,345
Hey, hey, hey!

323
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,936
- Excuse me. May I?
- Yes, of course.

324
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:36,989
Hey. I think it's really great
how you helped the police.

325
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:39,783
But you can't be running off at night.

326
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,037
I should tell the director.

327
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,959
- But I'll let it slide this time.
- Thank you.

328
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:51,461
You can borrow the book if you want.

329
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:53,297
- Really?
- Sure.

330
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:55,048
- Cool.
- Let's go.

331
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:05,976
Are you moving out?

332
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:09,229
I have to be with my mom.
She's in a real state.

333
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,982
- We got a ransom call today.
- What?

334
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:15,777
They realized it was a fake.
That's why they took my father.

335
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,447
- Think it's related to the kidnapping?
- Yes.

336
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:21,867
Now they want the statue
in exchange for my father.

337
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,744
- That's sick.
- Yeah...

338
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,623
But I want to talk about the phone.

339
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:30,417
- I told you I just...
- Borrowed it. I know.

340
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:35,088
- I want to stop that from happening again.
- And how exactly?

341
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,679
I can't accept that.

342
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:49,144
- Thank you.
- Thank you for trying to save my dad.

343
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:53,690
I'm sure the police will find him.
Glockner seems really capable.

344
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,276
They're wrong about Georg.

345
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:59,613
It wasn't him.
He'd never do something like that.

346
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,658
Well, one of the kidnappers
did look like him.

347
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:06,495
No! Georg is my friend.

348
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:13,460
And you were right. Actually,
he's the only one who calls me...

349
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:15,545
Kookie.

350
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,846
Well, maybe Gaby has some news.

351
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:30,269
- Yes, but she'd never tell us.
- Well, we'll just have to convince her.

352
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:37,484
You mean, by torturing her?
Thumbscrews, a stretching bank?

353
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:40,821
- Pull out her teeth?
- Or by asking her nicely?

354
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,073
Okay. Of course.

355
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,192
Hey.

356
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,614
Can I have a word?

357
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,617
Has your dad found anything else?

358
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:32,289
I can't give any
investigative results to outsiders.

359
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:35,834
I'm not an outsider
and I'm good at keeping secrets.

360
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:41,923
Willy?

361
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:47,429
- Willy? Why are you thinking about Willy?
- Willy, come out.

362
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:55,562
Hi.

363
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:59,191
I'm glad you're here.
I've got some questions for you.

364
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:02,611
- Okay.
- How long has Georg been working for you?

365
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:07,949
Is there a place where you would go
to escape and spend some time together?

366
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:11,703
He has a hut at Lake Waiga.
We go there to fish sometimes.

367
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:15,874
But... why do you ask?

368
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:20,253
- When's the last time you were there?
- Stop! Georg is innocent.

369
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:25,050
- It's my gut feeling.
- Don't you get it? Georg is his friend.

370
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:30,013
You don't investigate
using your gut, but your head.

371
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,015
You have to gather info first.

372
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:34,768
Stop showing off because your Dad's a cop.

373
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:40,315
They found the kidnappers' van
thanks to my photo of the license plate.

374
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:42,484
And they've got a clear lead now.

375
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:44,569
What lead?

376
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:47,823
Bye, Pros.

377
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:56,915
- Well, that failed.
- Why'? We got our information.

378
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:02,546
Now we just need a specialist
who can get us into the police station.

379
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,469
Why are we here?

380
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,055
You'll see.

381
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:26,695
Sorry.

382
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:33,452
- Math, chemistry or physics? Put it there.
- What?

383
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:37,831
Just give me a pen and an example
of your handwriting so I can copy it.

384
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:39,791
We're not here for that.

385
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:43,587
You don't want me to do your homework?

386
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:46,006
- No, we want something else.
- Really?

387
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:49,384
- What?
- A special mission.

388
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:14,075
Hot! Hot! Hot!

389
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,705
Hey, Harry.

390
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:23,668
- Hi, Gaby. Will you play "Jailhouse Rock"?
- Sure, Harry.

391
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,671
- Hello.
- Good evening. Going to practice?

392
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:45,106
- And'?
- The program is learning the commands.

393
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:50,153
We'll send the info to the site with the
digital switch codes and open the gate.

394
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:54,449
Seven, six...

395
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:58,453
- Five, four, three, two...
- Five, four, three, two...

396
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,791
The battery's empty.

397
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,918
- What?
- I can't believe it!

398
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,339
Be quiet.

399
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:25,146
I spoke to Willy Sauerlich.

400
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:28,650
Georg had a fishing hut at Lake Waiga.

401
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:30,652
He was there often.

402
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:38,660
This kidnapping is serious.
I don't want you investigating it.

403
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,870
What do you mean, Dad?

404
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:44,624
I know I've always taken you with me
ever since your mom left,

405
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,001
but...

406
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:51,172
you're not a police officer.

407
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:54,050
You're a little girl.

408
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:58,722
So, you deal with that
while I deal with this.

409
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:04,269
Dad, you were only able to find
the van thanks to my photo.

410
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,522
I should be informed
about the clues you've found.

411
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,708
The kidnappers' van.

412
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:32,339
Look.

413
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,179
- Willy!
- Isn't that clue rather mysterious?

414
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:46,061
- Those idiots...
- What is it this time?

415
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,328
Awesome.

416
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,012
Over here.

417
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:30,105
- Something's carved into it.
- Yes.

418
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:48,665
- "Stick?"
- "Stick?"

419
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,420
- "Stick?"
- Yes.

420
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:57,340
- "Stick."
- Guys. I've got it!

421
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,259
What'?

422
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:03,513
Yes! Look.

423
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:08,518
The "S" swerves the same way
as in my father's signature.

424
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:11,229
- You're right.
- It's a message from him.

425
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:14,357
- Good work.
- Good work.

426
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,945
That looks really mean.

427
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:26,661
Stay calm, little one.

428
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,877
You dimwits!

429
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:38,715
This is crazy.

430
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:42,093
Be careful!

431
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,520
That's disgusting.

432
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,856
Does that work with tigers, too?

433
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,484
Just beat it, okay?

434
00:37:57,734 --> 00:38:00,945
- Thank you.
- Don't let this get to your heads.

435
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,238
Still... Thanks.

436
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,115
Get out of here. Quickly.

437
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,716
It's okay.

438
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:23,802
Take a seat.

439
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:40,276
Are you happy here?

440
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,784
Yeah? I mean, do you like being here?

441
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:49,994
- Yes.
- Yes?

442
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:54,791
Then why are you doing the same things
you did at your old school?

443
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:58,378
Man, Tim! You're gifted.
Did you know that?

444
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:01,047
Don't mess it up.

445
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,261
This is your final warning, okay?

446
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,598
Hey, kid. Boo!

447
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:13,643
<i>Loser.</i>

448
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,271
"Stick..."

449
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:19,899
- "Stickup... Sticker..."
- Hey!

450
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:26,114
We're now a real investigation team.

451
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,449
So, we need a base, right?

452
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:31,619
I thought we could maybe convert my attic.

453
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:35,623
- I think there's been a misunderstanding.
- How come?

454
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:40,420
You were a great help,
but we're not an investigative team.

455
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:43,172
- Or a gang.
- Have you all gone mad?

456
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:46,759
Breaking into the police station?
How stupid was that?

457
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,220
You refused to tell us anything.

458
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:52,891
What clues did you find in the van?

459
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:56,603
I can't give any
investigative results to outsiders.

460
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:01,608
You don't need to tell me anyway.
My dad's keeping me informed.

461
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:04,068
Great. Continue with Daddy, then.

462
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:06,905
What did you find?

463
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:11,951
What would we get if we were
to pass on the information?

464
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:15,163
Brains, for example?
First of all, we need a base.

465
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,081
Told you.

466
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:22,420
We're stuck with the "stick" clue for now.
But we can work on the shoeprint.

467
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:26,007
Yes, but this standard sole
could belong to anyone.

468
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:28,426
But there's a tear in the sole here.

469
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:32,138
If we find the shoe,
we'll find the culprit.

470
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:35,975
Are we just meant to wait
outside the cobbler's or what?

471
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:39,646
No. We should look at
all suspicious footprints.

472
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:42,315
How will we know who's a suspect?

473
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:45,026
- By thinking logically?
- Yes!

474
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:49,113
Who else other than Georg
knew about the flight?

475
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:56,913
Well, everyone at Oak Avenue did.

476
00:40:58,581 --> 00:40:59,832
Chronologically.

477
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:03,252
We saw the gardener.
What can you tell us about him?

478
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:06,923
Hugo. Yes.
He's practically a member of the family.

479
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:11,469
He's been there since before I was born.
And so has Edda the housekeeper.

480
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,597
What about the woman
we met in the hallway?

481
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:17,809
Linda Mauser.
She's my father's business partner.

482
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:20,144
She invented "Death by Chocolate".

483
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,064
- What?
- Never heard of it?

484
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:26,609
The double fudge brownie
supreme chocolate.

485
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:31,239
There was also that woman
and the guy with the sunglasses.

486
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:35,368
- Amanda and Raimondo. But he's blind.
- No one is ruled out yet.

487
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:39,122
Okay. They've been
living with us for three months.

488
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:43,918
That's exactly when
your alarm started going off.

489
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:48,297
- Crazy!
- What exactly do they do?

490
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:54,429
Well... My mother is often alone

491
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:58,057
and Amanda and Raimondo do yoga with her.

492
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,810
They meditate and test out energy flows.

493
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:04,230
They have a weird group
of people with them,

494
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,066
with whom they summon spirits.

495
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:09,068
Summon spirits?

496
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:21,414
The big show is taking place tomorrow!

497
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:24,208
- What sort of show?
- A show?

498
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,836
All participants will form
an energy circle,

499
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:30,548
through which they'll contact
dead or missing persons.

500
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,341
They'll try to find my dad.

501
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:34,802
That's our chance to check them out.

502
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,971
And to get their shoeprints.

503
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:39,974
I know how.
With plastic sheets and silicone spray.

504
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:04,707
Okay, but the problem is that
they'll never let me take part in that.

505
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:06,584
How did they invite the guests?

506
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:09,462
Via e-mail
or something old-fashioned like that.

507
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:12,423
I can hack into it.
Just plant a Trojan,

508
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,259
access the keylogger with C:/...

509
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,887
Yeah, okay.
Can you get me in there as Tim?

510
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:19,430
That's what I said.

511
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:22,016
Not as Tim, of course.

512
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:27,480
But as Timothea.

513
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,232
Oh, no, guys.

514
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:31,067
Yep.

515
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:39,450
Do you think they really believe
they can contact the missing and dead?

516
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:43,204
That would be nice. I wanted to contact
my dad when I was young, too.

517
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,248
What happened to your dad?

518
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,000
- Car accident when I was five.
- Damn.

519
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:53,589
- That explains the Walkman. Was it his?
- Yes.

520
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:58,803
It has a mixtape in it which my father
gave to my mother when they fell in love.

521
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:08,604
Hurry. It's time.

522
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:13,192
Here's your earpiece.
I made it out of an old hearing aid.

523
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:34,589
Good evening.

524
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:39,510
- Your name, please.
- Timothea MÃ¼ller.

525
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:44,265
<i>Come in.</i>

526
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:47,768
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

527
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:50,813
May the games begin.

528
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,982
- Roger.
- Over.

529
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:56,986
Over.

530
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,009
Would you like some?

531
00:45:20,176 --> 00:45:24,305
A duet of tomato and mozzarella
and crayfish with an avocado dip.

532
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:36,484
Attach the trackers.
The black pickup truck is Raimondo's.

533
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:37,985
<i>Over.</i>

534
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:43,366
Tracker activated.

535
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,377
What'? I can't believe it.

536
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:55,962
Dad?

537
00:46:00,341 --> 00:46:03,010
Why is he dressed like that?

538
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,015
<i>- Good day. Hello.
- Come on in.</i>

539
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:10,226
Not him.

540
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:16,857
What's going on?
We have to abort the mission.

541
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:20,778
If my father finds out we're here,
he'll grill us alive.

542
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:28,744
Good evening.

543
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:42,758
We're in the clear. He fell for it.

544
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:50,057
Everything's just great here. Over.

545
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:03,237
Welcome. Please, come in.

546
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:11,996
You all know my husband's been kidnapped.

547
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:18,252
We're going to comply with
the kidnapper's demands, but...

548
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:20,963
GODS!

549
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:27,470
But we also want to use our power
to ensure Hermann returns safely.

550
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:32,892
We're going to contact Hermann now.

551
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,395
Please, sit down.

552
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,535
Raimondo the seer

553
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:53,996
and his medium Amanda.

554
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:05,508
Master...

555
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,260
Please, help us.

556
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:11,555
How is my husband?

557
00:48:12,515 --> 00:48:13,599
Where is he?

558
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:17,895
There are strangers among us!

559
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:27,238
Yes, that's true.
Mr. Kramer is a friend of the family.

560
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:31,158
And... Timothea MÃ¼ller.

561
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:36,747
She's really interested in spiritualism.
She was recommended by Lord Lonski.

562
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:39,417
Recommended by me?

563
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:41,627
The master wants to start.

564
00:48:59,228 --> 00:49:00,855
We have the first footprint.

565
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:03,315
YOU can come Up HOW.

566
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,110
It's show time.

567
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:14,285
<i>The bag on the coat stand is Raimondo's.</i>

568
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:19,457
<i>Over.</i>

569
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:31,552
His name isn't Raimondo.
It's Otto Biersack.

570
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,513
Yes.

571
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,433
There he is.

572
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:42,938
I can see him.

573
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,233
Oh, no.

574
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:48,652
Yes! No.

575
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:52,323
Hermann!

576
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:54,575
He says...

577
00:49:58,204 --> 00:49:59,246
What'?

578
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:05,586
He says...

579
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:11,300
<i>That we shouldn't be scared, Erna.</i>

580
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:17,932
<i>Close the circle.</i>

581
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:22,686
<i>Loan... I can sense him.</i>

582
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:32,780
Avocado.

583
00:50:41,497 --> 00:50:42,915
Where are you?

584
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,086
Hermann?

585
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:55,803
<i>He's close.</i>

586
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:10,526
I'll soon know...

587
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,028
where he is.

588
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,869
It's a sign!

589
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,162
Hermann!

590
00:51:29,378 --> 00:51:30,462
Master.

591
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,424
- The seance is over.
- No!

592
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:50,357
I'm so sorry, but we have to wait
for a new energy window.

593
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:51,942
For a better one.

594
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:54,778
Thank you.

595
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:04,538
What's so funny?

596
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:08,834
I'm just happy that the master is okay.

597
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,382
Tim has the footprints.

598
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:18,677
- Yes! Yes! Yes!
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

599
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:19,970
Yes!

600
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:23,932
<i>Okay, guys. We'll meet at headquarters
tomorrow to compare them.</i>

601
00:52:24,183 --> 00:52:26,143
Over and out.

602
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:31,565
Roger. Over. Yeah!

603
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:48,540
Thanks, Karl.

604
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:51,293
THE SHAOLONG PEOPLE

605
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:26,954
Hey! What are you doing there?

606
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:31,125
I'm trying to figure out
the Shaolong technique.

607
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:37,005
- The best fight is the one you don't lead.
- This is more about avoiding a fight.

608
00:53:37,256 --> 00:53:41,009
Okay. Well, it seems to have
a positive effect on you.

609
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:43,470
You can tell you're starting to fit in.

610
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:46,932
- Thanks.
- I'm serious. I'm really happy for you.

611
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:49,017
Keep up the good work.

612
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:52,271
- Okay. Good.
- Hey. I'll race you.

613
00:53:57,609 --> 00:53:59,445
Come on! Come on!

614
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:14,752
Let's see where
the tracking device takes us.

615
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:21,633
How did it go yesterday?

616
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,261
Your Timothea performance
didn't go down that well.

617
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:25,679
Why is that?

618
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:29,266
- Did your dad notice something?
- Maybe.

619
00:54:29,892 --> 00:54:33,061
- He asked me loads of questions about you.
- About me?

620
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:39,067
And? Were you able to answer them?

621
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:43,864
He'd rather I hung out
with my old friends.

622
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:46,492
And if it were up to you'?

623
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:50,579
It's always up to me.

624
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:54,291
They're on their way.

625
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:58,253
Do you also think
that Gaby and Tim are acting strange?

626
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,380
No. Why do you ask?

627
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:03,091
Tim always moves his arms
in a funny way.

628
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:07,596
- And they're always grinning.
- That's the best thing in the world.

629
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:09,306
Which is?

630
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:12,643
Love.

631
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:15,187
I see.

632
00:55:15,354 --> 00:55:18,565
- I also feel a lot of love.
- You do?

633
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:21,985
For the nut nougat mix, for example.

634
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:24,822
Sorry, Karl,

635
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:29,368
but I haven't been able to eat anything
recently with all this stress.

636
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:32,287
I think I've lost weight.

637
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:37,876
Thank you.

638
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:42,089
- Hey.
- Hi.

639
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,132
Finally.

640
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,344
Bring us the evidence.

641
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:02,568
- Damn it!
- This can't be happening.

642
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:06,738
- Look. There's not even a tear.
- Damn it.

643
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,409
So, no hit.

644
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:16,331
Stick!

645
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:18,041
Stick!

646
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,753
- Stickhausen!
- Stickhausen!

647
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,131
Yes. They both live in Stickhausen.

648
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:26,675
- So what?
- Willy! "Stick!"

649
00:56:26,842 --> 00:56:29,136
It's what your Dad carved into the van.

650
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:32,431
- That's where they're holding him.
- Yes, exactly.

651
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:37,102
- Good. We have to skip art and math.
- Okay. I'm in.

652
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:39,479
- Me, too.
- Thanks, guys.

653
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:18,936
Amanda?

654
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:21,521
What language is she speaking?

655
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:32,199
Quick, take cover!

656
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:40,958
It's Hakka.

657
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:44,211
A Mandarin dialect
spoken by the Shaolong monks.

658
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:45,796
- There's the motive!
- Yes.

659
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:50,676
The Heaven's Guard is sacred to them.
And the kidnappers fought just like them.

660
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:53,845
Man, you're right! We're really close.

661
00:57:54,096 --> 00:57:58,308
- My dad is in there.
- Let's go inside before Amanda returns.

662
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:07,693
Stop. Stop. Stop.

663
00:58:07,943 --> 00:58:09,987
- What?
- What is it?

664
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:12,155
- Over there.
- Careful.

665
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:50,068
Hey, guys. I found something.

666
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:53,405
Awesome. This must be it.

667
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:00,996
Hello?

668
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:03,206
Help!

669
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:07,252
Gaby and I will get the key.
It's next to Raimondo.

670
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:09,796
- What shall we do?
- Wait here.

671
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:11,465
Aye, aye, captain.

672
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:33,612
Oskar?

673
00:59:33,862 --> 00:59:36,114
Please don't bark.

674
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,326
I hate dogs.

675
00:59:41,036 --> 00:59:44,539
- But he sure is sweet.
- We'll call you "Gaby the Paw".

676
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:46,500
Very funny.

677
00:59:50,796 --> 00:59:52,214
Shit!

678
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:56,343
The key.

679
01:00:04,351 --> 01:00:08,230
Man, this noise is making me crave
sweet and sour duck.

680
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:22,786
Here. A small surprise
for our great captain.

681
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:26,206
- That's great. He'll be pleased.
- Exactly.

682
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:31,795
Stay.

683
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:41,179
Willy!

684
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,445
He's not blind.

685
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:21,720
He's not blind!

686
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:23,763
Willy?

687
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:26,892
- They broke in!
- Does your mom know you're here?

688
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:30,645
You've been living in my house
for weeks, ripping my mom off!

689
01:01:30,896 --> 01:01:33,815
Pretending to be blind
and with your cheap tricks.

690
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:36,359
- You're swindlers!
- Us? Swindlers?

691
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:39,112
You're the ones who broke in.

692
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:41,198
I'm calling the cops.

693
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:45,118
It's best if the police
are present during the house search.

694
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,205
House search?

695
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:51,708
- What are you expecting to find?
- My father!

696
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:13,563
He must be in there.

697
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:18,860
- Excuse me. Do you have the key?
- No. And I've never been down there.

698
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:20,695
- Sure.
- Yeah, right.

699
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:25,575
May we?

700
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:28,453
Of course. Go ahead.

701
01:02:43,802 --> 01:02:44,886
Impossible.

702
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:50,558
In order to get it open,
we'll need at least a StrongArm drill.

703
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:52,143
If not, we'll never...

704
01:02:54,062 --> 01:02:55,146
It's open.

705
01:03:09,411 --> 01:03:11,079
There's nothing here.

706
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:19,087
- I'm sorry, but we had to look into it.
- No problem, Inspector.

707
01:03:19,254 --> 01:03:22,716
But you do know that you can
count on our full cooperation.

708
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:28,388
- But they're swindlers!
- Why'? Raimondo being blind is a lie.

709
01:03:28,555 --> 01:03:31,182
But that's what people want to see.

710
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:34,936
Some high society mothers
are especially into it.

711
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:37,480
Especially those in their 40s.

712
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:41,484
You come from Dengfeng,
where the temple is.

713
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:45,071
That's true, but I'm not religious
in any shape or form.

714
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:48,950
I just followed my great love.
Otto travelled across Asia.

715
01:03:49,117 --> 01:03:51,119
I discovered more than just the continent.

716
01:03:51,286 --> 01:03:53,121
Is that also forbidden?

717
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:57,709
- But they know where my dad...
- But, Dad...

718
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:06,509
How did you know
that "stick" was carved into the van?

719
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:09,137
Gaby, the seance.

720
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:12,515
Were you also there?

721
01:04:17,645 --> 01:04:22,650
You think you make a great team, right?
Future professionals or something?

722
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:27,530
But the truth is that you four
are not a good influence on each other.

723
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:29,949
- That's not true.
- We found out so much.

724
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:31,826
You're wrong about Georg.

725
01:04:32,077 --> 01:04:36,122
I'm not actually meant to tell you this,
but the footprint on the van

726
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,208
came from Georg's shoe.

727
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:39,584
- W hat?
- W hat?

728
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:44,255
We found a plastic bag containing the
clothes and shoes worn during the attack

729
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:46,216
at his fishing hut by the lake.

730
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:48,051
- W hat?
- No way!

731
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:52,639
Plus, he made the ransom call.
The language lab has proven that.

732
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:54,891
But I guess you knew that, Willy.

733
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:59,396
- You were listening in on the call.
- You heard Georg's voice?

734
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:05,360
- Maybe it just sounded like him...
- Are you serious?

735
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:09,114
Guys, we're at a critical point
in the negotiations.

736
01:05:09,364 --> 01:05:13,243
- No one should intervene!
- What is going on with you?

737
01:05:13,493 --> 01:05:18,373
Karl, you were my best pupil,
and now your grades have hit rock bottom.

738
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:20,667
Gaby, you're skipping band practice,

739
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:23,920
although you'll be performing
in two weeks' time!

740
01:05:24,087 --> 01:05:26,923
Willy, your situation
is special, of course.

741
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:29,134
Special? You lied to us!

742
01:05:29,384 --> 01:05:31,511
Will you be quiet, Tim?

743
01:05:33,513 --> 01:05:34,681
Hey, Tim...

744
01:05:35,432 --> 01:05:37,100
We spoke so many times.

745
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:42,772
I warned you twice.

746
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:49,487
How are we meant to justify such
a generous scholarship to our sponsors

747
01:05:49,737 --> 01:05:52,282
under such circumstances?

748
01:05:53,908 --> 01:05:56,870
In order to give the rest of you a chance

749
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:59,622
to achieve your past success once again,

750
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:02,750
you're suspended, effective immediately.

751
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:18,933
I'm so sorry.

752
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:24,230
- Why didn't you tell us?
- You wouldn't have helped.

753
01:06:24,481 --> 01:06:26,900
- My suspension is your fault.
- No, it's not.

754
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:28,860
Whose is it then?

755
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:31,112
Our investigation was all in vain.

756
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:34,991
- No, it wasn't...
- No wonder you don't have any friends!

757
01:08:28,605 --> 01:08:30,398
They're at the old factory.

758
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:58,217
- Here comes our gang member.
- Where's our homework?

759
01:08:58,384 --> 01:09:02,805
In case you haven't realized,
your gang no longer exists.

760
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:04,432
- Come on, then.
- No.

761
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:09,103
Did you take
superhero vitamins or something?

762
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,606
- Do your own homework.
- What?

763
01:09:11,773 --> 01:09:14,776
Oh, right. You can't.
You're too stupid for that.

764
01:09:19,364 --> 01:09:22,158
- Stay where you are!
- Karl! What's going on?

765
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:23,785
They have a question.

766
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:25,828
- Yes.
- Yes.

767
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:29,207
- So, what's the question?
- It's about the party.

768
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:37,548
- Hey.
- Hey.

769
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:40,259
The gifted one is back.

770
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:42,804
Did you mess up, or what'?

771
01:09:56,693 --> 01:10:00,446
- Do you know what we'll be playing?
- "The Chase", I think.

772
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:33,855
- Hey! Check it out.
- Who is that?

773
01:10:34,772 --> 01:10:36,733
What is he doing here?

774
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:58,045
- What do you want?
- I know I messed up a bit.

775
01:10:58,296 --> 01:11:01,132
"A bit?". You messed up big time.

776
01:11:01,382 --> 01:11:03,676
- I've got to show you something.
- Yeah?

777
01:11:03,843 --> 01:11:06,053
How will I know you're not lying?

778
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:09,432
- I even dressed up as a woman for you!
- As a woman?

779
01:11:09,599 --> 01:11:10,975
- Quiet.
- Quiet.

780
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:16,939
See the shirt?

781
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:22,069
- Pauling?
- "Stick!"

782
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:27,116
- That's what my dad wrote in the van.
- Anyone could own such a shirt.

783
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:32,538
I mean, Pauling is
the only cool guy at the school.

784
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:36,250
And you're going on about a shirt?
It was Georg all along.

785
01:11:36,417 --> 01:11:39,253
- Just accept it.
- You've got to help me.

786
01:11:39,504 --> 01:11:40,630
Forget it.

787
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:03,694
That's the true value.

788
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:19,585
Mr. Pauling?

789
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:34,475
Fuck!

790
01:12:36,894 --> 01:12:38,563
<i>We've kidnapped your husband.</i>

791
01:12:38,729 --> 01:12:42,108
<i>Leave the Heaven's Guardian
at the Soiner gravel pit...</i>

792
01:12:42,275 --> 01:12:45,903
<i>Do it again.
And this time, put more feeling into it.</i>

793
01:12:46,571 --> 01:12:49,365
<i>- I can't!
- Of course you can.</i>

794
01:12:49,532 --> 01:12:51,117
Pauling?

795
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:57,915
Hello? Hello, Mr. Pauling!

796
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:00,376
Hello?

797
01:13:02,545 --> 01:13:03,880
Willy!

798
01:13:06,465 --> 01:13:07,800
Willy, wait!

799
01:13:14,098 --> 01:13:15,433
Mr. Pauling!

800
01:13:20,771 --> 01:13:24,442
On the tape... Listen to it.

801
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:31,240
- Karl! Hey. What are you doing here?
- So glad you're here. I need your help.

802
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:35,745
Yeah? With what?

803
01:13:35,995 --> 01:13:38,080
I know where Willy's dad is.

804
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:40,082
- Willy's dad?
- Yes.

805
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:42,168
Yeah...

806
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:45,212
- Where?
- Come with me.

807
01:13:45,463 --> 01:13:47,423
This way. Quickly.

808
01:13:49,383 --> 01:13:53,679
There's an entrance here.
Amanda and Raimondo just went inside.

809
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:56,641
You can see it
from the bridge over there, too.

810
01:13:56,807 --> 01:14:01,854
- You did a great job, Karl.
- Thank you, Mr. Pauling.

811
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:06,609
Over there.

812
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:19,121
Maybe we should inform the police.

813
01:14:24,001 --> 01:14:25,419
Oh, Karl.

814
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:30,549
- You're such a smart boy, aren't you?
- Yes.

815
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:33,886
- Still no clue'?
- You...?

816
01:14:37,264 --> 01:14:38,474
My eye!

817
01:14:39,934 --> 01:14:41,268
No!

818
01:14:41,519 --> 01:14:43,396
No! No!

819
01:14:43,646 --> 01:14:45,189
Let me go!

820
01:14:47,274 --> 01:14:49,735
How did the tape end up in my Walkman?

821
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:52,738
Karl and I put it in there.

822
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:55,574
What do we do now?

823
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:59,245
Firstly, we have to get back
our bad influence.

824
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:01,664
Okay.

825
01:15:18,889 --> 01:15:20,141
Gaby!

826
01:15:20,891 --> 01:15:22,226
Come with us.

827
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:25,354
- Karl?
- Karl?

828
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:29,400
- Where is he?
- He investigated further.

829
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:30,818
True.

830
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:37,491
Let's think. What else
could he have found out?

831
01:15:37,742 --> 01:15:42,246
Pauling saw the Heaven's Guard
when he came to my house at Oak Avenue.

832
01:15:42,413 --> 01:15:46,625
- He then told Amanda and Raimondo.
- And they gained my mum's trust.

833
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:48,753
With all the yoga energy stuff.

834
01:15:49,253 --> 01:15:52,173
When your dad realized
someone was after the statue...

835
01:15:52,339 --> 01:15:54,884
- Georg was to take it somewhere safe.
- Yes.

836
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:57,553
The perfect opportunity.

837
01:16:02,349 --> 01:16:05,811
Raimondo snuck on board
and tried to hijack the plane.

838
01:16:06,062 --> 01:16:08,147
- Something must've gone wrong.
- Yes.

839
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:13,778
Georg must've fought back.

840
01:16:22,787 --> 01:16:25,456
And Raimondo
jumped out of the plane with Georg.

841
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:31,462
Yes. He hid the parachute and the casket
and imprisoned Georg somewhere.

842
01:16:31,712 --> 01:16:36,509
When they realized it was a replica,
they had to come up with a plan B.

843
01:16:36,759 --> 01:16:39,345
- The kidnapping.
- The kidnapping. Yes.

844
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:42,223
And they want the statue
in return for my dad.

845
01:16:42,473 --> 01:16:43,557
- Yes.
- Exactly!

846
01:16:51,482 --> 01:16:53,150
We can't mess this up.

847
01:16:55,903 --> 01:16:58,739
- The lives of the hostages are at stake.
- Yes.

848
01:17:01,992 --> 01:17:04,245
<i>- I'll</i> get him.
- Yes, you will.

849
01:17:04,495 --> 01:17:07,581
Tell all units
to take their observation positions.

850
01:17:07,748 --> 01:17:10,167
Absolutely, Mr. Glockner. Absolutely.

851
01:17:13,546 --> 01:17:14,672
Oh, yes.

852
01:17:25,432 --> 01:17:27,476
What's Georg planning?

853
01:17:27,726 --> 01:17:29,770
Framing Georg was clever of them.

854
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:32,982
Raimondo must've been
wearing Georg's shoes

855
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:36,193
and he then hid them at the fishing hut

856
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:38,154
for the police to find.

857
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:47,371
What's that?

858
01:17:52,543 --> 01:17:54,086
Damn it!

859
01:17:55,129 --> 01:17:56,338
What'?

860
01:17:58,257 --> 01:18:00,134
That's genius!

861
01:18:00,384 --> 01:18:02,970
- Shit! Shit!
- Shit! Shit!

862
01:18:03,137 --> 01:18:06,932
- Where have they hidden my dad and Georg?
- They weren't at the farm.

863
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:12,229
In the basement of the old factory.

864
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:14,899
The tracker.
Amanda and Raimondo are there.

865
01:18:15,149 --> 01:18:16,775
That's what Karl found out.

866
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:19,862
- Did Karl go there alone?
- I'm calling my dad.

867
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:25,075
- What do we do now?
- Give chase.

868
01:18:26,076 --> 01:18:28,621
- No answer.
- Damn it!

869
01:18:28,787 --> 01:18:31,540
We'll do it ourselves.
We have to help Karl.

870
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:32,917
- Yes.
- Yes.

871
01:18:41,592 --> 01:18:43,802
Over there. It's the casket.

872
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:06,033
Oskar.

873
01:19:08,244 --> 01:19:09,662
What is she doing?

874
01:19:09,912 --> 01:19:12,206
- No idea.
- We can't let them leave.

875
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:16,835
- Where's Pauling?
- Shit.

876
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:26,428
Hey! I've got it.

877
01:19:26,929 --> 01:19:30,057
Here. Take a look. Is it the real one?

878
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:33,435
Without a doubt.

879
01:19:33,686 --> 01:19:36,146
Our monastery and people
are grateful to you.

880
01:19:36,397 --> 01:19:39,692
The Shaolongs' gratitude
is the only reward I need.

881
01:19:39,858 --> 01:19:43,028
- Let's release them and get out of here.
- Okay.

882
01:19:44,863 --> 01:19:46,115
Let's go.

883
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:50,369
- You'll be free soon.
- We've got the Heaven's Guard.

884
01:19:50,536 --> 01:19:52,538
Finally! It's about time!

885
01:19:52,705 --> 01:19:57,543
Go on down there and untie them.
I'll just hold on to it for now.

886
01:19:58,252 --> 01:19:59,628
Okay.

887
01:20:16,603 --> 01:20:17,813
Hey!

888
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:21,734
- I'm not into all this Asian nonsense.
- You wanted to help us.

889
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:24,611
I know, yes. But I've changed my mind.

890
01:20:24,778 --> 01:20:28,741
You'll never be able to get rid of it.
Everyone recognizes it!

891
01:20:28,991 --> 01:20:30,326
I'll melt it down.

892
01:20:30,576 --> 01:20:34,246
The gold and the diamond alone
are worth a fortune.

893
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:38,500
I trusted you, Steffen!

894
01:20:40,002 --> 01:20:41,462
Nice down here, isn't it'?

895
01:20:41,628 --> 01:20:45,049
Get used to being imprisoned,
you criminals.

896
01:20:45,215 --> 01:20:48,969
Criminals? Who's the criminal here?

897
01:20:49,136 --> 01:20:52,514
We've been fighting to get back
our sacred statue for decades.

898
01:20:52,765 --> 01:20:56,226
- I'm about to cry.
- Men like you show no compassion.

899
01:20:56,393 --> 01:20:58,896
Us Shaolong call you "damaged people".

900
01:20:59,646 --> 01:21:02,524
What do you get out of having the statue?

901
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:04,943
- Karl?
- It's an investment.

902
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:08,113
- What do you know about value?
- Are you okay?

903
01:21:08,364 --> 01:21:11,241
At our monastery,
it's worshipped by everyone.

904
01:21:11,492 --> 01:21:13,077
- The boy!
- What's wrong?

905
01:21:13,327 --> 01:21:15,329
- What's wrong with him?
- Karl?

906
01:21:15,579 --> 01:21:17,039
My inhaler.

907
01:21:17,664 --> 01:21:20,834
- Untie him! Quickly!
- We'll untie all of you.

908
01:21:25,589 --> 01:21:28,550
Get out, you little dirtbag. Come here.

909
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:30,427
Scram.

910
01:21:37,684 --> 01:21:38,894
Stay where you are!

911
01:21:39,061 --> 01:21:42,272
What's this?
Is class 7C on an excursion today?

912
01:21:42,523 --> 01:21:44,024
Come on. Scram!

913
01:21:44,274 --> 01:21:47,778
Get out of here.
Move out of the way!

914
01:21:51,448 --> 01:21:54,284
- Keep your eyes on the traffic
- Get him!

915
01:21:57,871 --> 01:22:00,374
I'll release the prisoners.

916
01:22:01,542 --> 01:22:02,835
I'm done with kids.

917
01:22:08,966 --> 01:22:11,927
- Damn it! We'll never catch him.
- He won't get far.

918
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:15,305
What's going on?

919
01:22:15,472 --> 01:22:19,101
What... What's going on with the steering?

920
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:22,729
Shit!

921
01:22:34,158 --> 01:22:36,827
Everything's fine.
You'll get through it, kid.

922
01:22:36,994 --> 01:22:38,745
- Just breathe.
- Hello!

923
01:22:38,996 --> 01:22:41,415
- Willy!
- We need Karl's asthma inhaler.

924
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:45,210
Pauling threw it on the net
under the iron bridge.

925
01:22:45,377 --> 01:22:46,920
- Go get it!
- What?

926
01:22:47,087 --> 01:22:49,214
- Every second counts!
- You can do it!

927
01:22:49,381 --> 01:22:51,300
Okay. Okay!

928
01:23:01,185 --> 01:23:02,227
Oskar!

929
01:23:06,315 --> 01:23:07,983
Come on, then.

930
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:09,610
You stupid mutt.

931
01:23:09,860 --> 01:23:12,529
Come on, then.

932
01:23:17,451 --> 01:23:18,785
Damn!

933
01:23:29,171 --> 01:23:31,423
I'll only wear sneakers from now on.

934
01:23:46,813 --> 01:23:47,898
Oskar.

935
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:54,905
What happened to you? Stay calm.

936
01:23:55,739 --> 01:23:57,574
Everything will be okay.

937
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:03,664
Everything will be okay, my darling.

938
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:13,048
Willy will be able to do it.

939
01:24:15,133 --> 01:24:16,718
Willy will be able to do it!

940
01:24:16,969 --> 01:24:18,428
He will!

941
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:50,836
You'll never catch me, you asshole kids.

942
01:24:55,799 --> 01:24:59,136
Willy will be able to do it. Don't worry.

943
01:25:01,513 --> 01:25:02,848
I've got it, guys!

944
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:04,975
Come on, then.

945
01:25:06,852 --> 01:25:09,104
Willy, you did great!

946
01:25:10,230 --> 01:25:11,523
Inhale deeply.

947
01:25:12,357 --> 01:25:13,567
Once more.

948
01:25:14,901 --> 01:25:16,069
Yes.

949
01:25:17,487 --> 01:25:19,740
- Willy.
- The drone.

950
01:25:37,174 --> 01:25:38,508
Hey. That's...

951
01:25:39,926 --> 01:25:41,303
Well done, kid.

952
01:25:41,553 --> 01:25:43,555
We still have a score to settle.

953
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:46,808
- Come on, Karl. Finish him off.
- Bonus level.

954
01:25:52,522 --> 01:25:54,316
'Yes! 'Yes!

955
01:25:54,566 --> 01:25:55,734
Yes!

956
01:26:16,254 --> 01:26:18,340
- Tim!
- Come on.

957
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:21,760
Come on. Give it to me. Give it to me.

958
01:26:21,927 --> 01:26:24,554
- No.
- Come on. I won't need to hurt you then.

959
01:26:55,752 --> 01:26:57,796
Very funny, Bruce Lee.

960
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:12,394
- Yeah!
- Shaolong style!

961
01:27:12,561 --> 01:27:14,730
'Yes! 'Yes!

962
01:27:36,251 --> 01:27:38,587
- Gaby!
- Dad!

963
01:27:53,977 --> 01:27:58,148
- You've got the key.
- The key. Yes. Of course, the key.

964
01:28:03,069 --> 01:28:04,362
Thank you.

965
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:10,994
- Hey, Karl. Hello, Ms. MÃ¼ller-Borello.
- Hello.

966
01:28:12,496 --> 01:28:14,664
- High five!
- Yeah, Willy.

967
01:28:23,381 --> 01:28:25,675
Hey! Tim.

968
01:28:32,724 --> 01:28:34,643
Have you done your homework?

969
01:28:37,354 --> 01:28:39,481
- Is that for us?
- Yes.

970
01:28:39,648 --> 01:28:41,107
Excellent.

971
01:28:56,873 --> 01:29:00,794
- They've already started.
- HQ <i>to</i> Glockner. <i>Please</i> respond.

972

the motorcycle is back. Please respond.</i>

976
01:29:22,941 --> 01:29:24,609
I'm taking over.

977
01:29:42,085 --> 01:29:45,130
They can't take him with them
where they're going.

978
01:29:46,172 --> 01:29:48,174
Gaby wants him to stay with us.

979
01:29:48,967 --> 01:29:52,220
You'll take good care of him.
I'm sure of it.

980
01:30:01,855 --> 01:30:06,985
In case you don't know what you want to be,
we could sure use you at the police.

981
01:30:07,152 --> 01:30:10,655
Thanks, but I want to be
an engineer, like my dad.

<i>We're now landing at Dengfeng.</i>

983
01:30:44,856 --> 01:30:48,485
- I can't believe it.
- Inspector Glockner turned a blind eye.

984
01:30:48,735 --> 01:30:51,655
And my boss thinks
he has a lotto make up for.

985
01:30:51,821 --> 01:30:55,033
He does. The Heaven's Guard
belongs to the Shaolong.

986
01:30:55,659 --> 01:30:57,369
You'll be home soon.

987
01:30:59,079 --> 01:31:01,665
Hey. What about me?

988
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:12,008
I've brought you something awesome.
Put them on.

989
01:31:12,634 --> 01:31:14,970
- Are you serious, Willy?
- "Willy?"

990
01:31:15,595 --> 01:31:20,141
Call me "Kookie" from now on,
because that's what my friends call me.

991
