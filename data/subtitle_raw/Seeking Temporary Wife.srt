1
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:34,680
...and that's a problem
that you are both a part of.

2
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,640
Okay, we'll go back
and talk some more about this later.

3
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:45,720
-Aren't you selling that boat?
-Four thousand for repairs.

4
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,760
-You want to buy it?
-No. I get seasick right away.

5
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,720
This is the best.

6
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,680
The future is swimming around in there.

7
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,960
My future. Hello.

8
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,680
Kick if you can hear me.

9
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,200
-Are you wearing that one?
-Yes.

10
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,160
-You're not wearing your other dress?
-Come on.

11
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,360
Why not? It's cute.

12
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:01,120
Maybe you want it to show more,
but I feel like a bloated frog in it.

13
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,800
-You look great in it.
-Then why don't you wear it?

14
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,960
I'm sorry... Hey...

15
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,320
Let's not fight.
Let's have a good time tonight.

16
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,240
-Was it?
-Yes, of course. It really was.

17
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,240
...on Sunday at 3 PM.
It's almost 7:30 PM, and...

18
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,520
-Shit.
-...look at Walpurgis night celebrations.

19
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,760
-Are you leaving?
-The kids have fireworks. I have to help.

20
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,920
Can't Ulla handle that?

21
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,120
Now where the hell's my tie?

22
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,120
Damn it.

23
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,600
-I can't let the kids down. You get that.
-No.

24
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,440
You'll understand when you have kids.

25
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,600
I don't want any. I prefer a man.

26
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,800
You can have both.
Women always want everything.

27
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,400
Milla...

28
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,960
Bye.

29
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,720
-Where are you going to be?
-At Wiberg's.

30
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,840
Sounds really boring.

31
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,600
Listen up, everybody. Hey!

32
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:20,480
You see, Per and I...
We have an announcement to make.

33
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,880
We didn't know if this was a Spring party,
Walpurgis party or Friends party...

34
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,720
but now we've made up our minds.
This is our...

35
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,560
-..."we're having a baby" party.
-It's gone through?

36
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:41,080
Next week we're leaving
for Salvador de Bahia, in Brazil,

37
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,400
where a little baby boy is waiting for us.

38
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,840
Excuse me!
I feel I have to say a few words

39
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:04,200
as your oldest friend,
and this is just... rock 'n' roll!

40
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,440
You've been trying so hard,
and we've been hoping.

41
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,040
I know you'll be
the greatest parents in the world.

42
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,520
After me and Pia, I mean.

43
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,080
And...

44
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,320
Oh, that's right, Pia is giving me a hint.

45
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,040
Of course, we have to raise a toast
to all the moms and dads here!

46
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,600
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

47
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,160
I just have to counterattack and show
a picture of our little cream bun

48
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,120
who will arrive in three months' time.

49
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:48,120
Pia finds me embarrassing now. I know
you're a fed up with me right now, love.

50
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:54,400
And I... just want to try to...
to say that...

51
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,040
having a child is the greatest thing...

52
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,080
and I promise you that I will
be the greatest mom in the world!

53
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,360
-You are not going to be a mom!
-No, of course not - a dad.

54
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,560
You're not going to be a father either!

55
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,280
Pia...

56
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,920
Because the father's name is Thomas,
and I'm in love with him.

57
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:24,520
Well, now that's been said, and
I didn't mean to blurt it out like this...

58
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,480
but it just happened. Thanks for
everything. I think I should be going.

59
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,760
-Bye.
-Pia?

60
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:40,160
Take care of Fredrik.
Thanks, that salmon was wonderful.

61
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,120
Pia! Wait! Pia!

62
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,720
Pia, wait! Stop the car!

63
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,920
Pia!

64
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,840
-Ow, calm down, will you?
-You're just wrong!

65
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:07,160
Pia, you're just stressed out.
Can we talk about this?

66
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,080
-Don't you get it? We're done!
-Calm down.

67
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,640
Close the door, we're done!

68
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,320
-Sorry!
-It's just the hormones.

69
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,760
I'm so sick of your fucking hormones!

70
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:27,840
Stop! My child, you can't just take...

71
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,920
No, then.

72
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,360
Wiberg.

73
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,160
WIBERG

74
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,680
-I didn't recognize you at first.
-No wonder, it's been ages.

75
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,960
-Anyway, make yourself at home.
-I will. Thank you.

76
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,680
-Welcome.
-Thanks.

77
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,200
-Milla!
-Hello.

78
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:06,000
God, it's been ages!

79
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,360
-I didn't know you were coming.
-I wasn't...

80
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,160
-Did Kjell know?
-No, I don't think so.

81
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,440
-How are you?
-Fine, really great.

82
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,040
So have you... found a man yet?

83
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:29,080
-Nothing steady.
-Isn't your little clock ticking?

84
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,480
-No, not for me.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

85
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,800
-Hello, Milla!
-Hello!

86
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,400
Sweetie.

87
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,280
-Arvid!
-Well, if it isn't the little babysitter!

88
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,080
-Hello!
-Hello.

89
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:50,240
You can't call her that any longer.
That was a thousand years ago.

90
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,080
Indeed.

91
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,640
-Do you still smoke?
-No... Well, just at parties.

92
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,000
Go ahead.

93
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,680
-Stop it.
-God, you're such an old bore!

94
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,040
This is no game. My kids are in there!

95
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,240
I came here tonight because...

96
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,960
I've spent every big holiday evening
alone for the last six years.

97
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,720
Either we move in together

98
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,360
or I... want to be on my own.

99
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,800
-You're drunk, aren't you?
-Six years, Kjell!

100
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,880
Let's do this:
I'm going in for a bite to eat.

101
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,440
You wait a few minutes
and then go straight home.

102
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,680
-I'm not leaving without a promise.
-Five minutes.

103
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,240
Idiot!

104
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,480
Everyone out onto the balcony!

105
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,920
Everyone, now!

106
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,880
Hello?

107
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,680
What the hell?

108
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,880
What?

109
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,880
This is my flat, I live here.
How did you get in?

110
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:18,400
-The balcony.
-Balcony? How did you end up there?

111
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,160
-Please, just let me out. I feel sick.
-What the...? Who are you?

112
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,200
Just leave it. I'll clean up.

113
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,240
-Would you like something to drink?
-Home...

114
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,840
Wait. I'll get you a sweater.

115
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,520
-Wear this.
-Cool.

116
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,440
-Good morning.
-God morning, boss.

117
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:42,720
-You should meet new women, Fredrik.
-Just the one would do, thanks.

118
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,920
You have to think big.

119
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:58,280
Fredrik? I want to ask you one thing...

120
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:04,760
-My youngest, he needs medicine...
-How much?

121
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:10,880
One thousand... but 500 would do.
And it's just a loan.

122
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,880
-Sure, that's fine.
-Thanks.

123
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,640
That Pia woman
should get a punch in the face.

124
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:26,000
-Hello, Tomme.
-You having a sneaky fuck in here?

125
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,400
-How about "good morning", Tomme?
-Good morning, Tomme.

126
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,720
Exactly.

127
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,760
Hello. That's 12 crowns.

128
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,080
There you go. Goodbye.

129
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,680
-Hello.
-Hello.

130
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,320
-The usual?
-No, just a quickie.

131
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,800
-Kjell...can you tell me one?
-I don't have any more.

132
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,560
Just one more, please?

133
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:15,000
This: Why do blondes stand on their heads
with their legs spread after sex?

134
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,800
Well, they're waiting for someone
to swipe the VISA card, aren't they?

135
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,800
And in...

136
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,120
I'm in control of my life.
I am happy and strong.

137
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:44,200
I'm in control of my life.
I am happy and strong.

138
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:49,320
I'm in control of my life.
I am happy and strong.

139
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:54,760
-You were drunk!
-Just a little tipsy, I wasn't wasted.

140
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,880
-You don't do that kind of thing drunk.
-I wouldn't have dared otherwise.

141
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,720
You told me to give him an ultimatum!
I did. And he disappeared!

142
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:08,400
Good, at last it's over.
Now you can meet a real man.

143
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,280
-Like where?
-Hush.

144
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,440
Let's go to the shooting bow position.
Stretch your legs forward.

145
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,080
Raise two fingers on each hand
and place them around your toes.

146
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,280
Breathe in and tighten the bow...

147
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:27,000
I am a good person.
I deserve all the love in the world.

148
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:32,160
I am a good person.
I deserve all the love in the world.

149
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,640
-Does he sleep well?
-I'd forgotten how small they are.

150
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,040
Look, he even looks like you.

151
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,160
She's due in five weeks.

152
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,840
Seriously, forget about Pia.
She wasn't that much fun anyway.

153
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,640
I don't give a shit about Pia!

154
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,120
-Exactly.
-Yes.

155
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,920
See at it as shopping for food.
You want a certain kind of cheese.

156
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,480
If they're out of it, you just
buy the cheese on sale.

157
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:10,800
So you have another cheese for a week.

158
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,600
-A change can be fun.
-I don't want fun!

159
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,440
I want my child. It's my child too.

160
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:32,800
I think it's a boy. She has that,
you know, pointed stomach.

161
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,120
-It's a girl.
-Come on! No way.

162
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,080
Girl stomachs are wider. Hers was pointed.

163
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,160
It is a girl.

164
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,320
She's already given birth.

165
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,400
Pia!

166
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,400
Open up, I want to see her!

167
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,600
Pia, I want to see her!

168
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:03,320
-Pia's busy. She's breastfeeding.
-Are you the fuckhead stealing my baby?

169
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,440
-I don't think so.
-Thomas, I'll deal with this.

170
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,040
Take care of her. The pacifier is there.

171
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,440
-Fredrik!
-I want to see her.

172
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,600
Please, you can't just...

173
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,840
-I want to see my child!
-She's not yours!

174
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,920
-I want my child! She's mine...
-No.

175
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,480
-Prove it!
-Okay.

176
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,280
RESULTS OF DNA TEST

177
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,120
She's Thomas's, okay?

178
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,520
Okay? Are you happy now?

179
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,800
Do you know why I think that is?
It's because he's too nice.

180
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:54,720
You're so wrong. Had any of my men been
half as nice, Alice would've had a dad.

181
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,640
Cows are nice, not men!

182
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,120
It can't be a coincidence
that he hasn't got a family yet.

183
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,200
Women need a bit of resistance
or they'll go looking elsewhere.

184
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,600
What kind of a Wild West attitude is that?

185
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,720
-Dad, tell her she's wrong.
-Uh-huh.

186
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:16,520
Don't involve him in this now!
So let's take this out.

187
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,120
Say good bye to Fredrik.

188
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,240
-Do you need to borrow money?
-No.

189
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,600
-Mom, come!
-God help me, Fredrik.

190
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:49,520
-You're 41 and have no life.
-It'll be alright, Mom.

191
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,800
Thanks for helping me.

192
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,880
-Bye.
-Bye.

193
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,360
Wait, wait!

194
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,720
That's it.

195
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,720
Go for it.

196
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,520
You got it!

197
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,920
-My fault. I lost my focus.
-How about a rematch?

198
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,920
-How about a couple of pints? Per?
-No, I have to get home to Samson.

199
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:33,160
-Svante, how about you?
-No, the little one has chickenpox.

200
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,440
-But doesn't anyone...?
-Bye.

201
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,280
Doesn't anyone want to come along? Hey!

202
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,520
There's a difference.
Women have it in their blood.

203
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,160
And what do men have in their blood?

204
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,600
You've gone astray, Fredrik
Get yourself a real girlfriend.

205
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,880
I don't want a girlfriend.

206
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,200
-So make a clone of yourself.
-Thanks. More suggestions?

207
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,720
Place an ad: "Seeking temporary wife."

208
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:59,440
-"Relation terminated on child delivery."
-Your parents are weird, Samson.

209
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,880
Hi.

210
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,720
I'm in full control of my life.

211
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,240
Fredrik Lundström?

212
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,520
Hello, Fredrik. I'm Milla Hedborg.

213
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,640
Welcome. Please take a seat.

214
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,840
So... Let's see.

215
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,320
Okay, Fredrik.
"Restaurant business"? Which one?

216
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,440
-Fredrik's Hot dogs.
-So you're Hot Dog Fredrik?

217
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,160
Yeah.

218
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:13,200
-So we're talking about adoption?
-Yes... that's right.

219
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:19,640
-I gather you've tried a long time.
-Yes... Jesus, yes!

220
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:24,840
-It's so much harder than you think.
-In vitro fertilization, hormones?

221
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,760
Well... no... I've...

222
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,760
The...

223
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:40,760
The longing for a child
can be very deeply rooted.

224
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:47,400
Well. I dream about it.
I'm kind of obsessed, actually.

225
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,320
It's an age thing. Everyone
you know has children and a family.

226
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,600
And... Well, that's what's important
in my life right now.

227
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,200
-And your girlfriend?
-No, I've...

228
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,640
She's not with me now. She's...

229
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,160
-She's still at work.
-I see. So you work together?

230
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,840
Yes.

231
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,120
That looks good on your application.

232
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:29,480
-How do you mean?
-It suggests continuity.

233
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:34,040
I think the board will see it as a plus.
But she has to come here in person.

234
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,720
Of course.

235
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,320
How about Friday at nine o'clock?

236
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,640
-Is that okay?
-You mean this Friday?

237
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,960
That shouldn't be a problem.

238
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,840
-Okay, then!
-Yes.

239
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,000
Did you have any more questions?

240
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,080
Well...

241
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:05,560
Weren't you in my apartment...
on Walpurgis night?

242
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:12,840
Yes. Well, I thought
you looked a bit familiar.

243
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,600
That's right,
I'll give you your sweater back.

244
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:30,000
-Oh, don't worry about that.
-Okay.

245
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,920
-Bye.
-Until Friday.

246
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,520
Yup.

247
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,200
-Hello.
-Hi.

248
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:07,160
Oh, right.
I was thinking about something, Tanja.

249
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:12,040
-You know I want to adopt a child?
-Congratulations.

250
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:17,320
Yeah, well... But you
have to be a couple for that...

251
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,880
Right...

252
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,560
So I thought that you and
I maybe... could become a couple.

253
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,120
Sorry. That was a stupid idea.

254
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:38,440
I apologize. It would feel weird. I'm
exploiting you enough as it is. Sorry.

255
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:57,720
-I'm off now. Bye.
-How long would we be a couple?

256
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,040
Half an hour, but it was a dumb idea.

257
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,040
If you pay me 2,000.

258
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,120
Would that be okay?

259
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,360
-Then you wouldn't exploit me.
-Okay, wow. You know what you're saying?

260
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,360
-You don't want to think it over?
-No.

261
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,640
Okay. Wow.

262
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:27,720
Okay. Now I'd like you
to tell me about your parents.

263
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,720
-Tanja, would you like to start?
-Me?

264
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,480
Well...

265
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,840
My parents...

266
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,480
We were very close.

267
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:45,200
So close!
And they were my very best friends.

268
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:52,000
They were wonderful people.
Helpful, warm...

269
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,720
But now they are gone!

270
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,760
Oh my...

271
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,600
I'll just get some tissues.

272
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,640
-What are you doing?
-It's for your sake.

273
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,760
It's too much...

274
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,120
Here. I didn't mean to upset you, Tanja.

275
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,640
-How are you?
-Better.

276
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,480
-At home in Russia we cry every day.
-Yes.

277
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:30,320
-Let's leave that subject for now.
-Mother!

278
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,120
My mother....

279
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:42,080
Yes, well... You were previously
married in Sweden, Tanja. Briefly.

280
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:47,760
You wouldn't want to
meet that man, Melinka. He was horrible!

281
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,480
He lacked everything that my Fredrik has:

282
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:56,880
Love, tenderness, and respect
- he respects women, Milla.

283
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,920
I believe you, but I have to know
that the divorce has taken effect

284
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,320
since you two have to get married
to be approved as adoptive parents.

285
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,600
Well...

286
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:16,600
-So it was a bit more complicated...
-What do you think, Fredrik?

287
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,720
That I will move in with you
and listen to that woman

288
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:26,360
telling me how to be a mother!
I, who have given birth to two boys!

289
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:32,240
-Please, I would pay you.
-Pay me? Get one thing clear:

290
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,720
-I am not for sale!
-But...

291
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,160
Well, come on!

292
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,000
Come here, Fredrik.

293
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:56,920
Tomme, come here and help me.
I need to lift this.

294
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,040
Come on.

295
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,040
I want to clean under it.

296
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:10,920
-You have such a nice firm butt, Tanja.
-Shut up or get out of here!

297
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,680
I'm sorry, Tanja. I'm so sorry!

298
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:20,200
It's all right. You're a good man, Tomme.

299
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,960
-Do... do you really think so, Tanja?
-Definitely.

300
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,360
Tanja, I think you are lovely too.

301
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,200
Really? So you like Russian women?

302
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,000
Get out of the kitchen, Tomme!

303
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,720
I want 50,000.

304
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:17,400
-Okay, forty.
-Forty-five.

305
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,880
-In US dollars.
-No way, in Swedish crowns.

306
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,720
-Do you think I'm a millionaire?
-Okay, then. 45,000 crowns

307
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,720
-And you sign over half the grill to me.
-What?

308
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,280
And then we'll tear the papers up
when the baby's here.

309
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,640
-Are you nuts?
-Then forget it.

310
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,120
You bet I will.

311
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:52,000
-Alright. Would you do it?
-I want a contract.

312
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:56,240
Come on, we're friends,
we can trust each other!

313
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:01,920
One day you'll meet a girl,
and I'll be left on my own with a baby...

314
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,040
-...no job and not one ruble.
-I'm not like that.

315
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:12,520
You're not? You're a man,
and all men think with their dicks.

316
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,000
That's the way God wanted it, not me.

317
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:24,440
How about this: 20 grand now
and the rest afterwards?

318
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,680
I'll sign half my business over to you,
and we'll write a contract?

319
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,920
Okay.

320
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,840
You've both declared your wish
to enter into marriage.

321
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,040
I therefore ask you, Fredrik Lundström:

322
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:50,600
Do you take Tanja Smirnova
as your lawfully wedded wife?

323
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,120
I do.

324
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,600
Do you, Tanja Smirnova

325
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,360
take Fredrik Lundström
as your lawfully wedded husband?

326
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,320
I do.

327
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,480
Control of my life.

328
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,080
I'm in...

329
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,200
control of my life. Happy.

330
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,280
I'm in control of my life.
Happy and strong.

331
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:36,720
-You have a lovely voice, Tanja.
-Thank you.

332
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,720
-Are these your parents, Fredrik?
-Yes, that's right.

333
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,480
That's Mom and Dad.

334
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:59,160
-You can tell.
-You look very much like your dad.

335
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,240
It seems to have been a wonderful wedding.

336
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,840
-Yes, it was.
-Just lovely.

337
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,560
-Is it okay if I take a look around?
-Yes, of course.

338
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,520
-I can show you.
-Yes, do.

339
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,320
Okay.

340
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:24,080
-These are nice. Did you bake them?
-Yes. from powder that you mix with water.

341
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,640
-You can get it at the grocery store.
-Right.

342
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,880
Fredrik likes them very much.

343
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,720
Have another.

344
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,920
Well...

345
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,120
What do you think
about our chances really?

346
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:45,880
That isn't up to me, it's up to the
board. I only give recommendations.

347
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:52,840
-You've long wanted children, right?
-Yes. Always.

348
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:57,160
And I've been a stand-in dad
for my sister's kid too.

349
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:02,320
And... I don't know.
It makes you a better person.

350
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:09,400
Just to have breakfast with someone
struggling with a spoon, or bake cookies.

351
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:16,680
-Does this sound silly? Unmanly?
-It sounds very nice.

352
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,880
-How about you?
-What about me?

353
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,360
-Don't you want children?
-No, it's...

354
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,560
I don't know,
maybe it's because of my work.

355
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:38,400
You see so many sad cases,
and... I'm fine as it is.

356
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:53,880
I want to discuss something
many adoptive parents like to avoid:

357
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,400
That there is a birth mother somewhere.

358
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,800
Any thoughts?

359
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:08,120
Well... You worry, of course.

360
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,080
Can they come afterwards and...?

361
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:17,400
I mean, if you give up your baby,
you give up your rights to it.

362
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,560
-That's how you feel?
-Yes, I agree.

363
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:25,040
They can't be very suitable mothers.

364
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,120
If they were,
they wouldn't be in that situation.

365
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,560
Miss... What do you know about that?

366
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,320
A mother wants to be with her child.

367
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,440
-What do you know about real moms?
-Tanja, Tanja!

368
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:44,680
Do you think anyone willingly would
give their child to a cow like you?

369
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:49,840
-Of course any mom can be good...
-We're just discussing and analyzing...

370
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:55,240
-Do you need a degree to be a mom?
-Tanja, shut the fuck up!

371
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:01,120
-This is going to hell!
-This is degrading!

372
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:07,760
I'd do anything for my kids!
No one can tell me I'm a bad mother!

373
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:12,720
-They didn't. Why not just shut up?!
-Should I be ordinary like you?

374
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,560
Never!

375
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:21,120
Yes, five times a week.
I'll be lecturing at the university.

376
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,400
So don't worry, the money is coming.

377
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,040
Yes, Mom, we will pay.

378
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:35,920
Call the doctor
and ask what his shoe size is.

379
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:42,080
Tell him I'll get him six pairs,
like the ones the Swedish king wears.

380
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:46,240
Yes. But, Mom...

381
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:51,720
Save your tears. Should something
really happen, I'd... Okay, bye.

382
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:56,440
-This looks new.
-Get your filthy hands off it.

383
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:01,160
-I have enough problems as it is.
-Sure.

384
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:07,480
Here's 3,000. You can have 500
but you really have to pay.

385
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,280
-Just a little ketchup.
-I'll give you one line here.

386
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,640
Tomme... Tomme!

387
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,840
Tomme?

388
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:38,240
Do you have a crush on her?

389
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,320
-Hey, Kjelle...
-What?

390
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,560
Well... How do you do it?

391
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:55,280
-Are you talking about...?
-No.

392
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,200
No, no, I know how to do that.

393
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:04,440
No, I mean before.
So that the girls will like you?

394
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:12,560
Do you know what I think?
You have to reveal yourself.

395
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:16,400
That always works. All girls love that.

396
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,960
-Hello!
-Hello.

397
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,960
-Hi. Would you like a ride?
-Yes, please.

398
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,400
-Go, get in.
-Yes, thanks!

399
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,960
-Some weather, isn't it?
-I was lucky you drove by.

400
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:16,080
-Thank you very much.
-Don't mention it.

401
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,160
-Will you be alright now?
-Yes, no problem.

402
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,480
-It sure is raining.
-Yes.

403
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:33,000
-Do you want to...? Your sweater.
-What?

404
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:40,080
-Do you want to pick up your sweater?
-Oh. Yes, definitely.

405
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,120
Okay.

406
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:53,160
I've washed it, but I didn't dare
to iron it, because I didn't know...

407
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,480
-Well... see you.
-Okay.

408
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,120
Would you like anything?
Like coffee, I mean.

409
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,760
Well... why not?

410
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:11,320
...so I worked at the hospital
before they closed it down.

411
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:18,200
And I was so sick of people
always telling me: "Do this, do that."

412
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:23,640
I had been working extra at the grill,

413
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:27,920
and the old man who owned it
went and kicked the bucket.

414
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,240
-He just fell head first into the mash.
-No! That didn't happen.

415
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:35,120
-I'm kidding.
-I'm so easily fooled.

416
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:39,520
Well, he did die,
so I got the opportunity to take over,

417
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,160
and I thought: "Why not?"

418
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:47,600
And I enjoy it. It suits me perfectly.

419
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,240
Maybe it doesn't look like much,

420
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:55,360
but my little box there
provides security to many people

421
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:00,080
with someone to talk to,
and the hot dogs always taste the same.

422
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,080
That's all there is to it.

423
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,080
You must meet a lot of fun people too.

424
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,400
I wouldn't say "fun," but...

425
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:22,560
Custody battles, divorces,
loneliness. All kinds of misery.

426
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,520
Yeah...

427
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,400
Well, I guess I should be heading home.

428
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:41,640
That's right, the sweater! Oh, sorry.

429
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,240
Are you alright?

430
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:31,480
-Did I come on too strong?
-No, no, it's just me.

431
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:36,480
Can we like... not do it?

432
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:40,600
Of course! No problems.

433
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:57,040
-Is Milla your real name?
-No.

434
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,880
Camilla Renate Hedborg.

435
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:15,480
Fredrik Egon Lundström.

436
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,960
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

437
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:26,160
-Tomme?
-Hello, Tanja.

438
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,000
Come in.

439
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,240
Just close the door behind you.

440
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:46,960
It's the very best - Moskovskaya.
Only 100 crowns for you.

441
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,440
-No, I don't want any.
-You don't?

442
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,600
-Are you sick, Tomme?
-No.

443
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,600
You must be.
You eat too many French fries.

444
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,840
Tanja... I...

445
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,240
I wanted to ask you...

446
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,000
Yes?

447
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:11,320
Sometimes, even if you don't think so...

448
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:15,880
-Sometimes it just comes up.
-What comes up, Tomme?

449
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:18,400
A chance.

450
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,840
It just shows up, so you have to grab it.

451
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,560
You just have to take it.

452
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:28,720
Tomme. I have to sleep now.

453
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:34,200
You have to go.
Bye, I'll see you tomorrow.

454
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:36,160
Wait, Tanja.

455
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:40,920
But I just... wanted to ask you...
if we could...

456
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,720
fuck?

457
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:51,440
It doesn't work like that, Tomme.
You have to be in love first.

458
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:57,600
-But I'm so... horny.
-Go home and have a wank.

459
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:03,080
And I'll see you tomorrow.
Bye. Sleep well!

460
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:46,720
I hope you don't think that I'm...
I just don't know what to say.

461
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:52,000
No. I'm not like this in reality either.

462
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:59,680
Milla. I would love to...

463
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,320
You know, Tanja and I, we've...

464
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:08,560
You don't have to say anything!
I mean, I have Kjell.

465
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:13,080
And you have Tanja.
Let's not make it more complicated.

466
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,000
I understand, completely.

467
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:21,600
And besides, you're my client,
so I'm not allowed to.

468
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:29,520
But I hope you realize that this won't
affect our professional relationship.

469
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,720
No.

470
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,040
Why would it?

471
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,800
-Once is almost never.
-Exactly.

472
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:41,520
Things like this happen.
We're not more than human, are we?

473
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,920
Yes, that's true.

474
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:50,040
I have to go open the grill now.

475
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:02,840
Fredrik. I hope you realize
that this has to stay between us.

476
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:06,080
Of course.

477
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,800
Bye.

478
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,880
Okay... does anyone want to say anything?

479
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:28,760
-Arne and Janine, will you begin?
-Well, I don't know.

480
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:37,920
My customers aren't happy
when they make an investment...

481
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
that doesn't grow.

482
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:44,920
In other words: I'm the infertile one.

483
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,920
That's nothing to be ashamed of.

484
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,520
-Jenny and Kalle?
-Well...

485
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:57,640
We've tried and we've tried...

486
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:01,080
-With thermometers, ice bags...
-Yeah.

487
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:05,120
nasal sprays and pills... I don't know
how we will go back to normal.

488
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,840
No.

489
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,280
Tanja?

490
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:22,720
Fredrik. How do you feel about it?

491
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:29,360
-About what? About sex?
-Yes, for example...

492
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:35,120
-Well...
-You and Tanja, but you don't have...

493
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:40,760
-Do you want to know how often?
-No, that's not necessary. Just if...

494
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:46,480
I just want to say that Fredrik
and I have a wonderful time.

495
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:50,960
You Swedish women talk about it,
we Russians just do it.

496
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:56,840
We are friends with our vaginas.
We know what they are used for.

497
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:02,200
You Swedes just complicate it
and then analyze things.

498
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:06,400
I think you're wrong. Surely
that's more to do with personality...

499
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:11,640
Wait a minute! I want you to know
I'm really in touch with my fifi.

500
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:14,040
So why are you so angry?

501
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:18,680
Have you researched this
in any detail, Tanja?

502
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:22,600
No? Swedish women are known for

503
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:26,560
being close to...
being buddies with their vaginas.

504
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:31,680
And Swedish women's attitudes
to intercourse are very open and free.

505
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:36,600
I am a good person,
I deserve all the love in the world.

506
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:41,920
I am a good person,
I deserve all the love in the world.

507
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,320
I gain weight whatever I do.

508
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,640
I bet you cheat and eat at night.

509
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,960
-Bye.
-Bye.

510
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,800
No, Milla. It happens to be illegal.

511
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:14,080
Yes. But that's not the worst of it...

512
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,840
What?

513
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:21,000
I'm pregnant, too!

514
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,840
-By whom?
-I don't know.

515
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:32,520
-What are you going to do?
-Yeah, well...

516
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:35,800
I have to get an abortion, because...

517
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:38,720
I don't want to have children.

518
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:44,400
But I want to know whose child
I don't want to have.

519
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:50,480
And even if I wanted it
they're both married, and not to me.

520
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:53,840
Milla, it doesn't work like that.

521
00:58:54,680 --> 00:59:01,280
-You have to decide what you want.
-But that's what I don't know!

522
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:06,240
I just don't want to end up
like my mother, alone and bitter.

523
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:10,480
I don't even know how it would work.

524
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:14,440
And I'm afraid
I'll forget the baby somewhere.

525
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:19,520
And in my nightmares
it turns into a banana

526
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:22,480
that I sit on and squash.

527
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:25,720
What do I do?

528
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,840
You have to decide yourself

529
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,440
whether to have a child or not.

530
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:37,200
But you'd better
keep your hands off Fredrik.

531
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:48,280
-Hello.
-Hi.

532
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:57,840
-Are we going to eat here?
-Well excuse me if it isn't in Paris.

533
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:00,200
Come on.

534
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:10,360
-Hello. The usual?
-You betcha. But two.

535
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:14,640
-I don't eat meat.
-So choose something else.

536
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,280
-Hi.
-Hello.

537
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:18,520
-Hello, Kjelle.
-Hi.

538
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:24,720
-Did you want anything?
-Do you have anything vegetarian?

539
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:30,080
Well... mashed potatoes or fries.

540
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:34,080
-No, I'm fine, thank you.
-Are you sure?

541
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,360
-Oh, yes.
-Tell me one?

542
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:39,360
No, not right now, Tomme.

543
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,720
-Just one.
-I said not now.

544
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:45,720
-Please?
-That's enough, Tomme.

545
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,880
-Stop that, please.
-Thank you.

546
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:53,680
-I'll do one. Do you want to hear?
-Sure.

547
01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:02,960
What's the difference between
a blonde and an ironing board?

548
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:07,000
The ironing board comes together.

549
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:11,840
-Its legs!
-What?

550
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:16,680
What's the difference between
an ironing board and a blonde?

551
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:20,320
The ironing board's legs come together.

552
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,760
-That wasn't funny!
-Don't get hysterical.

553
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:38,840
-I'm not hysterical!
-Aren't you hysterical?

554
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,680
Honey...

555
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:47,120
Wasn't it a little bit funny?
Do you want a bite?

556
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:55,600
-Stop.
-Why?

557
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:59,080
Stop the car.

558
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,560
-Are you okay?
-No, I'm not! I'm pregnant.

559
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:20,600
What the hell...? You haven't told me.
How did that happen?

560
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:23,840
-Well, I don't know!
-How can you not know?

561
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,080
-Why don't you get it fixed?
-Fixed?

562
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:29,160
Fix it! You don't want to have children!

563
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:33,320
I know! But people change.
I'm up and down all the time.

564
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:37,040
One day I feel like this,
the other like that!

565
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:44,760
So you've changed your mind?
Why didn't you tell me?

566
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:47,400
Because I wasn't pregnant!

567
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:50,880
-Would that have changed anything?
-I never said that.

568
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:55,040
No. Because I refuse to be like Ulla,
who sits there alone with the kids.

569
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:59,720
Hey, I have been a very good father.
A very, very good father.

570
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:04,960
I don't give a shit about you being
a good father! I want you to love me!

571
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,320
But I do.

572
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:12,640
-Camilla, I do love you.
-So why didn't you ever leave Ulla?

573
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:18,720
Milla! Milla!

574
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:30,280
It's not their fault. Cheeses are by their
very nature meant for different things.

575
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:33,480
-He's no good for her.
-What do you know about that?

576
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:38,680
-I... I just know.
-Maybe she's getting just what she wants?

577
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:46,760
Come on, you've been talking about kids
ever since you did your military service.

578
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:48,840
Yeah.

579
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:51,480
Bye, I'll see you around.

580
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:34,760
I don't know if you want me...
But a little baby, Milla.

581
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:43,000
It's like starting over.
Like becoming young again.

582
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:51,800
-So... aren't you happy?
-Sure...

583
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:55,400
Yes, I am!

584
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,800
Ow!

585
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:32,480
It's Ulla.

586
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:37,480
No. No! What are you doing?

587
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,640
-Hello.
-Well...

588
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:50,280
I mean, I know we said it was nothing...

589
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:53,640
and I know that...

590
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:57,480
But I can't stop thinking about it.

591
01:05:57,560 --> 01:06:00,160
It doesn't go away.

592
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:04,520
-Can I come in?
-No.

593
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:13,680
Please, please don't do this.
It's just not possible.

594
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:19,000
-How the hell can you be with him?
-You don't even know him.

595
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:22,440
-Yes, I do.
-It's none of your business.

596
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:25,840
Have you heard me
say one bad word about your...

597
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:28,440
platinum-colored boobarella?

598
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:30,960
-But, please!
-It's impossible.

599
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:33,200
Tanja ...

600
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:48,720
-Who was that?
-Just a neighbor who...

601
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:51,200
Something wasn't working.

602
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:55,640
I couldn't... help him.

603
01:06:56,520 --> 01:07:00,720
I don't want this shit here!
Are you done with the cash register?

604
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,600
Yes!

605
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:09,360
Fuck!

606
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:22,400
Pull yourself together, my friend.
You are a kind man,

607
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:28,520
you have friends, you're healthy,
and you'll make a wonderful dad.

608
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:33,440
Or mom. You don't have to be sad. Drink.

609
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:36,920
Cheers.

610
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:53,320
Tomme Bolander, smooth as ammonia.
Come and congratulate the dad.

611
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:57,480
-Tanja. I have to talk to you.
-Not now.

612
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:01,320
-Come on, have a drink.
-That's not a good idea.

613
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:04,120
Come on, we're having a party. Go ahead!

614
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,840
Fredrik...

615
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,480
Tomme, Tomme!

616
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,760
Shit, Tomme.

617
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:27,360
Damn, now I need to pee.

618
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:36,480
-I love you, Tanja.
-Not now!

619
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:39,560
Yes, I do right now.

620
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:42,920
Who the hell put this here?

621
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:48,320
You have to feel the same way, Tanja.

622
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:52,520
I... I can't feel this way

623
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:55,840
unless you also feel this way.

624
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:02,720
You have to feel this way. Hey, Tanja.

625
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:05,120
-What the hell is this?
-Vodka.

626
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,040
-You make me so disappointed.
-Tanja, we have to talk.

627
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:15,240
You need to go home now. Oh, come on.

628
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:19,640
I own half of this.
That's none of your business!

629
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:23,640
-I want this out of my grill!
-Put it back!

630
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:28,400
-They go out now!
-You think I can live off your pittance?

631
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:32,320
That I can support a family on my salary?

632
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:35,960
I'll never get to keep the kid
if they find out about the booze!

633
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:38,920
Fuck! Bastard!

634
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,760
I hate you! I knew you'd do that.

635
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:47,720
What were you thinking? "Nice Fredrik."

636
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:51,920
"He's so dumb
he can be tricked into anything."

637
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,400
Maybe you were planning on
getting the whole grill?

638
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:59,040
I'm not giving you one penny.

639
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:02,480
No! I want my 25,000, you fucking Swedes!

640
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:06,160
You're scared to death
of everything in this country!

641
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:10,080
If you were a real man
you'd already have a kid.

642
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:13,560
You don't even know how to make one!

643
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:16,600
At least I know how to look after them!

644
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:29,600
Fredrik? Get up. Fredrik!

645
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:31,680
Oh my God!

646
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,800
Tomme, come here!

647
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:39,280
Tanja... Tanja!
Can you see me now?

648
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,680
Can you see me now, Tanja?

649
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:46,960
I'm revealing myself to you.

650
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:51,880
I'm revealing myself, Tanja.

651
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,760
What happened?

652
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:15,720
-Oh, my.
-What's that?

653
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:28,200
Dear Fredrik.
I can't go through with this.

654
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:32,840
I'm going home to Russia and my children.

655
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:37,040
Maybe I can give them
a better future now.

656
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:41,880
I'm bringing the kitchen.
After all, half of it is mine, right?

657
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:47,440
Please forgive me, Fredrik. Tanja.

658
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:55,680
-When is she coming?
-She isn't coming.

659
01:12:55,760 --> 01:13:00,600
Yes... She said she would.
She said that.

660
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:03,280
Listen up, Tomme.

661
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:07,560
She's never coming back.
She's in Russia, where she came from.

662
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:09,800
Go home now.

663
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:47,960
It's not about what I think anymore!
The rules are clear on that point.

664
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:50,160
But what's best for the child?

665
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:57,240
My task is to assess your suitability,
and the criteria is

666
01:13:57,320 --> 01:14:02,920
that all information must be verified,
that you don't have a criminal record...

667
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:08,120
And it is assumed that the couple
is living together.

668
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:17,040
I don't get it. Why did you do it?

669
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:20,080
Why?

670
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:25,800
-I want a child. Is that unnatural?
-No.

671
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:29,440
But you shouldn't go about it dishonestly.

672
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:33,640
Who are you
to talk to me about honesty?

673
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:02,440
Hello! Did you wait up for me?

674
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:10,440
Sit down.

675
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:27,280
Well... this child...

676
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:38,280
I'm not certain that it's yours, Kjell.

677
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,360
Hey? Hello?

678
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:20,760
Seriously, only you can decide what to do.

679
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:24,440
Men come and go.

680
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:31,640
I've never regretted having my kids.

681
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:37,000
I'd rather live alone with them
than be without them.

682
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:56,040
-I liked Tanja.
-Dad!

683
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:02,800
-Didn't you even have a crush on her?
-No.

684
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:07,040
It was a huge mistake.

685
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:14,560
Listen... I was wondering...

686
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:19,360
Can I stay with you for a while?

687
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:24,840
Yeah...

688
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:28,520
But...

689
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:32,000
I was...

690
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:40,840
I won't be living there anymore.

691
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:04,280
CRUISES TO RUSSIA

692
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:38,280
I imagine that there's
a huge change to have a child.

693
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:43,680
Absolutely. We are
very close to each other. Definitely.

694
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:50,120
I think it's important to be honest
with each other. We are, right?

695
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:56,200
And to remember that whatever happens,
the kid has the right to have two parents.

696
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:01,400
Thank you.

697
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,520
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

698
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:23,920
-Hello.
-Hello.

699
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:30,880
-A "Milla's special," please.
-Finally, someone orders it!

700
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:46,880
-No, it's on me.
-Thanks.

701
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:58,880
-Half a "special," please.
-Mustard? Ketchup?

702
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:18,160
Bye, Fredrik.

703
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:38,720
-So? Did it meet with your approval?
-Yes.

704
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:54,160
Fredrik?

705
01:20:56,120 --> 01:21:00,800
Well, I'm pregnant.

706
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:03,480
Yeah, I can see that.

707
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:10,000
I've no idea what I'll be like
as a mom. Maybe I'll...

708
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:14,760
Maybe the kid will hate me,
or I'll forget it at day care.

709
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:19,320
-Then Kjell can to step in.
-We're not together anymore.

710
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:24,240
Did you get a haircut?

711
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:26,640
No.

712
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:33,000
This kid...
I intend to raise it on my own.

713
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:34,760
But...

714
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:40,160
We could do a paternity test, if you want.
And then you can see...

715
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:43,840
If you want to take part.

716
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:46,760
I wanted to ask
if you want to be the father.

717
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:51,600
-What?
-I mean, it might be yours.

718
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:58,920
You'll just be the dad, not be with me.

719
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:04,600
No changing diapers in the middle
of the night, just the dad thing.

720
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:13,440
Please say something.

721
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:19,440
Go to hell.

722
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:50,320
Do you know
why I got together with your mom?

723
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:54,880
There was this other girl...

724
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:58,120
Elisabet.

725
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,720
She didn't want me.

726
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:07,480
Or so I thought.

727
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:15,680
But, I met her again 20 years later.

728
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:25,240
She said that she'd never forgiven me
for getting married.

729
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:34,720
You just never fucking know with women.

730
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:39,280
No.

731
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:47,000
Come in.

732
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:52,480
You probably think I'm here because
you're pregnant, but I'm not.

733
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:55,840
See...

734
01:23:55,920 --> 01:24:02,600
If I find out the baby's mine,
I couldn't stand not living with it.

735
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:07,480
And should I find out
that it isn't my baby, then...

736
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:12,920
I don't...

737
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:17,040
I don't know why women won't live with me.
I don't know what's wrong with me.

738
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:20,800
I think that maybe they don't know me,
they don't know who I am.

739
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:26,160
I know that I'm bad,
really bad, at showing...

740
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:29,560
...what I feel, and so on.

741
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:31,680
And Tomme.

742
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:35,760
Someone I know... No, a pal.

743
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:38,520
He says I'm too nice and a coward.

744
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:42,800
Well, okay, I am a cowardly person...

745
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:47,160
I'm a coward, but two people have to dare,
and you have to make a choice.

746
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:51,520
Coffee or tea? Mustard or not?

747
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,320
Go.

748
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:01,440
Don't you understand? Go to hell!

749
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:35,280
Hello.

750
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:30,040
Mister, you're scaring off
the other customers.

751
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:35,880
I will serve all of you.
Please stay in line.

752
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:41,720
-Volodya!
-Okay, okay.

753
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:43,760
Please hurry!

754
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:47,720
-Blabs all the time. Blabs and blabs...
-Blab, blab...

755
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:50,080
-Woman.
-Wo-man...

756
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:54,880
-Woman.
-Wo-mman.

757
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:58,880
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye... Bye.

758
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:01,800
Bye-bye!

759
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:04,160
We accept all currencies..

760
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:19,720
Oh, Milla! Milla!

761
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:25,560
-Who's Milla? My name is Eva.
-Eva...

762
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:29,320
-Eva!
-Who's Milla?

763
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:32,040
Eva!

764
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:40,480
-Just screw all this!
-Don't worry, I'll help you with it all.

765
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:48,000
-I'm going to explode!
-No, you won't. I'll help you.

766
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:52,680
-I don't want to!
-I'll help you. I'll have the baby.

767
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:55,200
I love you.

768
01:27:57,680 --> 01:28:01,080
What's happening? Is it coming?

769
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:11,080
Hello? Is there anybody in there?

770
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:16,440
Yes. There you are...

771
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:11,880
