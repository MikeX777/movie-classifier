1
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,718
Once upon a time...

2
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,995
My name is Yuki.

3
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,478
I was born amidst a riot.

4
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:02,154
That was the day
my destiny was decided.

5
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,995
Help, please help me!

6
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,870
Hey, try not to cause
a big commotion, eh?

7
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,392
What the hell? Freeze!

8
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,315
Hey... hey!

9
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,551
SAMURAI CHICKS

10
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,989
Hello.

11
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,996
That'll be 924 yen.

12
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,394
Here's your change of 76 yen.

13
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,872
Thank you very much.

14
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,075
Yuki?

15
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,037
Hey, it is Yuki.

16
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,831
I didn't know you were
out here in Tokyo.

17
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,472
You don't remember me, huh?

18
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,993
I'm Nakamura.

19
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,355
I used to live behind you...

20
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,716
How have you been doing?

21
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,316
- Man, you're all so grown up now.

22
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,231
- You've got the wrong person.
- Man, you're all so grown up now.

23
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,072
I was born on an island in the south.

24
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,430
It was once a great trading port...

25
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,628
...a kingdom of peace.

26
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,998
One year ago...

27
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:42,390
...I was still a normal student
at the Orion Dancers' Academy.

28
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,113
They specialized in
raising future stars.

29
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,718
Put your back into it.

30
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,988
All right, girls. Stop there for a bit.

31
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,319
My name is Abe and I am an
instructor
from the expert program.

32
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,470
Step forward when I call your name.

33
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,553
Yuki Nakata!

34
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,310
Yes.

35
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,518
Step forward.

36
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,633
Your normal program is done as of
today.

37
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,432
Due to your outstanding
performance...

38
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,438
...you've been chosen to be
one of the four selected.

39
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,910
We'll start the expert
program tomorrow.

40
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,234
Be prepared.

41
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,150
Yes, sir.

42
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,710
That is all.

43
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,073
Congratulations, Yuki!

44
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,469
Congratulations!

45
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,789
Thanks.

46
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,554
Ready...

47
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,630
- Let me join, too.
- Sure.

48
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,557
From this part, then.

49
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,596
Did practice start already?

50
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,792
Oh, but the instructor's not here yet.
I'm safe, right.

51
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,399
Phew, that was close.

52
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,151
Hey!

53
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,350
Saki!

54
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,471
You got picked, too!

55
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,559
Congrats!

56
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,675
Thanks!

57
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,474
You too, Mickey!

58
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,512
Honestly I wasn't too sure
for a while there.

59
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,151
We're the four chosen ones, huh.

60
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,673
So who's who?

61
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,916
Oh yeah...

62
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,550
You're such a spazz.

63
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,599
I'm Aki.

64
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,116
I'm Mickey and this bimbo here is
Saki.

65
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,874
What's your name?

66
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,993
Oh yes, I'm Yuki.

67
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,755
Come on, no formal talk. We're
gonna be hanging out from now on.

68
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,075
Nice to meet'ya.

69
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,149
Nice to meet'ya.

70
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,434
- Pleased to meet you all.
- You're doing it again.

71
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,758
It's Miss Cocoe!

72
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,309
It's totally Miss Cocoe!

73
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,029
What are you doing here, Miss
Cocoe?

74
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,633
Are you sure these are the four?

75
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,595
That'll be the last smile you get.

76
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,193
You'll be in the expert
program starting today.

77
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,749
You will abandon
all emotion from now on.

78
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,599
K-ing-dom.

79
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,673
K-ing-dom.

80
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,238
K-ing-dom.

81
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,679
K-ing-dom.

82
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,833
K-ing-dom.

83
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,312
K-ing-dom.

84
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,718
The Orion Dancers' Academy's
expert program...

85
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,957
...was a program to train spies.

86
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:27,519
Spies were developed so the
Kingdom could gain independence
from Japan.

87
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,873
I told you to abandon all emotion.

88
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,751
Instructor Abe...

89
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,392
...I will be greeting the principal
and returning to Tokyo.

90
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,596
We're counting on you.

91
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:23,996
Okay.

92
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,996
We shall begin your lessons.

93
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,796
Yes, sir.

94
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,797
That was the day...

95
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:41,316
...we threw everything away in order
to become the greatest spies ever.

96
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,954
In-

97
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,679
In-de-

98
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,956
In-de-pen-

99
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,359
In-de-pen-dence.

100
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,469
Encryption.

101
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,715
Weaponry.

102
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,433
Martial arts.

103
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,353
Camouflage.

104
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,276
These were some of the special
classes we had everyday.

105
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,715
Your dancing is...

106
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,676
...our propaganda!

107
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,392
- Tri-bal self-determination.

108
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,436
- Tri-bal self-determination.
- To be like Cocoe.

109
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:40,512
That was what kept us going
through
the vigorous training.

110
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,556
They all pass...

111
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,315
Yuki...

112
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,750
Aki...

113
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,510
Saki...

114
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,515
Mickey.

115
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:07,035
The growth you four have shown...

116
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,839
...this past year is incredible.

117
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:18,513
You have shown the results
that Abe has expected.

118
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:29,149
Therefore, you will be debuting
earlier than the other students.

119
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:36,151
Go to Tokyo and help
Cocoe with her duties.

120
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,039
But don't let your guard down.

121
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:46,031
The real battlefield is
far more intense than this.

122
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,830
The duty you hold is an
important part of the plan, too...

123
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,430
...gain the Kingdom's
independence.

124
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,519
Ignorance is sin.

125
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,552
Take a good hard look at history.

126
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:15,476
That way, you will be
forced to remember...

127
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,957
...the bitter and hard
suffering of the past.

128
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:33,999
And we headed out to Tokyo.

129
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:20,270
Head-to-Roppongi-tunnel

130
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,951
Kintaro Migihara, head of national
security. 173cm tall, 66kg, blood
type B...

131
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,399
...an Aquarius.

132
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,670
He's the target of this mission.

133
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,556
Well?

134
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,399
Yes, it still feels
a little strange, but...

135
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,556
I'm not talking about your arm.

136
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,598
I'm talking about those damn
terrorists.

137
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,753
Yes, pardon me, sir.

138
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,791
Are you getting anywhere?

139
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:02,239
Yes, well, I have been in the hospital
the last 6 months, too, and...

140
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,876
I don't want any excuses.
I'm tired of them.

141
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,197
What did I pass that
anti-subversive activities act for?

142
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,438
I made it easier for you
to do your stuff.

143
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,476
Use that new law...

144
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,952
...the new citizen's log
or whatever it was...

145
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,835
...to find all of the supporters of the
Kingdom in Tokyo.

146
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,389
Yes, sir.

147
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,633
In the name of justice,
we can't let those terrorists...

148
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,270
...continue to do what they want.

149
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:38,758
Yes sir. We have already started
a plan to take care of that as well...

150
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,509
We've got to make that entire
area a specially appointed zone...

151
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,714
...expand the base's territory
and have the American army...

152
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,316
...keep a close watch over them.

153
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,158
Absolutely, sir.

154
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,069
Kuroiwa...

155
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:15,478
Take a look around. It's like
we're in Europe or the U.S.

156
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,514
Absolutely, sir.

157
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,878
We've gotta start
cleaning this area up, too.

158
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,029
Absolutely, sir.

159
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,676
Anything unclean is bad for society.

160
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,989
Absolutely, sir.

161
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,956
You!

162
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,550
National Security

163
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,439
Just you wait...

164
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,836
You freaks!

165
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,591
One deer down!

166
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,356
Mom!

167
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,830
Mom!

168
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,831
Mom, listen!

169
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,638
I was accepted into the academy!

170
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:22,832
I got into the academy in first place!

171
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,432
Mom!

172
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,719
Mom!

173
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,954
Mom?

174
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,319
When I was 12...

175
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:33,438
...part of an army plane
hit my mother...

176
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,355
...and killed her.

177
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,194
Be-hind you

178
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,274
Our mole inside the government
obtained this film.

179
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,877
Long live...

180
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,750
...the Kingdom!

181
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:42,951
They say Saki died without saying a
thing, no matter what they did to
her.

182
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,353
...and?

183
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,748
Did you come all the way
to tell us that?

184
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,749
Well...

185
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:06,076
...I will be returning to the Kingdom.

186
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:15,070
I smell something fishy going
around at the academy.

187
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,033
I was wondering if you all
would like to return with me.

188
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:28,033
- Who will take over our duties in
Tokyo?
- You need not worry about that.

189
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,111
Is this because we've failed?

190
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,158
No. You are all competent.

191
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,669
The president and Cocoe both
have acknowledged your abilities.

192
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:42,192
We are hoping you will take part
in developing the new generation.

193
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,032
We're still in the middle of a
mission.

194
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,557
Can you do it with just the 3 of you?

195
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,429
We can.

196
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,157
Not by force, but...

197
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,799
...I wanted to confirm your feelings.

198
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,669
I don't want to retire yet.

199
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:22,079
I can continue even if
I lose an arm or a leg.

200
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,353
You're right.

201
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:05,436
You will be the only ones
left to protect Cocoe.

202
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,475
Yes, sir.

203
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,669
And...

204
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,640
...hang onto this until I return.

205
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,390
'Use all instruments as weapons'.
Right?

206
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,710
Here's your change of 76 yen.

207
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,078
Thank you very much.

208
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,597
Hey, you!

209
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,639
Um...

210
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,160
...I'm part of a dance team.

211
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,833
There's an event we're going to be
a part of. You can come if you like.

212
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,036
You're a dancer too, right?

213
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,949
You should come.

214
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:13,232
...according to reports,
there have been no sign of fire.

215
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:17,439
It's believed to have been
caused by an accidental spark...

216
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,114
...igniting the gas
within the building.

217
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:26,559
The body identified as Orion
Dancers'
Academy president Shoukichi
Ohta...

218
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:32,158
...as well as a dozen other
instructors
and students have been found.

219
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,593
The police are still identifying them.

220
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,317
Please stand by.

221
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,430
Aki.

222
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,798
What are we gonna do?

223
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,190
We just wait for the next order.

224
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,278
There's no order coming.

225
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,755
That's an unusually wimpy
thing for you to say.

226
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,154
Maybe we should go back to the
Kingdom.

227
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,596
We can't leave Cocoe alone.

228
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,749
But...

229
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,431
We don't even know if Cocoe...

230
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,313
We're still in the middle of
a mission. Don't forget that.

231
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,040
Even if the academy is really gone...

232
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,676
...there's going to be a second,
and a third academy.

233
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:15,276
I don't want Saki's death
to go to waste.

234
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,993
...you're right. Sorry.

235
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,432
Sorry. I didn't know
what I was saying...

236
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,795
Careful!

237
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:41,997
Yuki!

238
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,435
Yuki, they're coming.

239
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,436
Hurry.

240
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,273
Hurry. Run.

241
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,549
Follow them.

242
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,913
They've run into the tunnel.

243
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,348
Consider them like wounded
wolf bitches... be careful.

244
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,038
Let's go, Yuki.

245
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,510
Yuki!

246
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,438
Yuki, can you get up?

247
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,512
Are you all right?

248
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,391
Mickey, take care of her.

249
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,594
Hurry, go!

250
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,548
Over there!

251
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,908
Mickey.

252
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,436
We should be okay out here.
Let's wait it out a while.

253
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,437
Please... go...

254
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,197
Just go...

255
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,710
No.

256
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,837
I don't want to leave
any more of my friends.

257
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,075
Saki... and Aki...

258
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,513
Don't worry.

259
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,109
I'll think of something.

260
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,193
Mom...

261
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,550
I'm gonna die, aren't I?

262
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,479
Hey Namba, it's closing time
already.

263
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,352
- Oh, yeah.
- Thanks guys.

264
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,948
Come on, they're closing. Let's go.

265
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,552
Thanks for the food.

266
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,473
Thanks. Hey, be careful, eh?

267
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,514
- Come again. Thanks!
- See ya.

268
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,113
Ms. Toyo?

269
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,078
What's wrong?

270
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:20,719
Is she hurt?
Oh man, I'll call an ambulance.

271
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,029
You don't want me to, eh...

272
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:51,279
Now I get why she tried to pretend
she was someone else that other
day.

273
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:01,549
When I sold the family farm to
the army base and used that money
to...

274
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:05,875
...make this restaurant out in
Tokyo...

275
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:13,359
I guess I forgot about those
dreams I had when I was younger.

276
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,755
No...

277
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:20,278
I bet I was trying to forget about it.

278
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:26,629
I had given up, thinking that
it was something I couldn't do.

279
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:35,550
The adults didn't do anything
about it... but these kids...

280
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:49,033
How about it, Ms. Toyo,
you want to join me?

281
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,115
Hmm.

282
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,279
Maybe she went to the bathroom.

283
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,799
You were hanging in there, eh, kid?

284
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,080
Ignorance is a sin!

285
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,270
Take a good hard look at history.

286
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:31,594
That's right. Ms. Toyo is already...

287
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,797
Here... some new bandages.

288
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:43,915
And...

289
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,198
...some coca cola?

290
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,229
You used to love these, Yuki.

291
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,628
Have a drink.

292
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,358
And...

293
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,269
This...

294
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:22,395
I'll be getting stuff ready downstairs
so holler if you need anything.

295
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,676
Cocoe's sudden retirement!

296
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,314
She goes into hiding without
a press conference!

297
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:49,955
Because of marriage or illness?

298
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,313
- Is she?
- Yes.

299
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:47,031
She's a tough one. A normal person
would have died of insanity by now.

300
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,158
They were pretty insane
to begin with, I guess.

301
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,399
...coming. I know it's coming...

302
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,990
Let me out!

303
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,510
Who the hell?

304
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:19,191
We'll never give up!

305
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,077
He was still alive?

306
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:26,953
Pretty tough.

307
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:30,548
But it's the end for all these guys.

308
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,640
Is Cocoe still alive?

309
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,758
I understand.

310
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:54,518
So that's where they're being held...

311
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,399
Hiya.

312
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:08,269
Hey, sorry about that.
We're unusually packed tonight.

313
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,154
Sorry, eh? Come again.

314
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:15,513
Here you go, your tomatoes.

315
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,911
And here's that special pork dish.

316
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,117
What are you doing?

317
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,908
Yuki! Run!

318
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:24,869
She's gone.

319
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:27,873
The back! Go around to the back!

320
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,998
Over there!

321
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:49,234
There she is!

322
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,190
In-

323
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,189
In-de-

324
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,155
In-de-pen-dence.

325
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,276
In-

326
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:15,235
In-de-

327
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:16,229
In-de-pen-dence.

328
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:18,028
Uh, everyone. The Head of National
Security, Mr. Migihara, has taken
time...

329
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:21,557
...from his busy schedule to watch
our work.

330
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:25,355
Please continue the
great work that you do.

331
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,954
Mr. Migihara, it's almost time.

332
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:37,032
They've caused us a lot of trouble...

333
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:40,397
...but they settle down once
they're locked up in cages.

334
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:43,512
Must be a trait of the Kingdom, too.

335
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,073
Absolutely, sir.

336
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,118
It's here.

337
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:57,232
It's here.

338
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:01,350
They day of independence is near.

339
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:04,836
Hmph.

340
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:08,994
The mixing of people causes
the country to deteriorate.

341
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:11,628
We must eliminate them
once and for all.

342
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,554
Absolutely, sir.

343
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,034
What's happening?

344
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:36,192
I'm not sure. Maybe there's
not enough electricity.

345
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,794
What's going on?

346
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:44,033
An intruder has opened the holding
cells and has started a fire.

347
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:46,913
What's going on, Kuroiwa?

348
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:50,875
Yes, it seems that someone
has pulled a trick on us...

349
01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:00,959
Kuroiwa! You said those bastards
from the academy were all killed!

350
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,115
Yes, sir.

351
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:04,595
Idiot! I'm firing you already!

352
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:07,439
Sir, we must get to safety first.

353
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:15,838
What is this? Is there a fire?

354
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:19,074
Yes, apparently someone has
started a fire.

355
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:22,118
Why didn't you say that
in the first place?

356
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,790
This way, sir!

357
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,797
Dirty creeps!

358
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,878
How dare you let this happen to
me?

359
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:39,835
You're going to pay for this
when we get back, Kuroiwa!

360
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,798
Sir, the exit is that way!

361
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,113
I think it's this way.

362
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:36,309
Absolutely, sir.

363
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:58,519
Let me go, you monster!

364
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,398
Let me go!

365
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:24,714
Let me go, monster!

366
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:30,631
Hey! Someone! ANYBODY?

367
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:33,839
Stop!

368
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,998
Monster! Let me go!

369
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,390
Go away!

370
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,437
Let me go!

371
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,671
Help me!

372
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:54,269
Yuki!

373
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:55,788
Instructor Abe.

374
01:04:58,440 --> 01:04:59,793
Kill!

375
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:06,230
Yuki! Kill!

376
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,956
Yuki! Kill!

377
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:12,671
- Kill! Yuki!
- Please help me!

378
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:13,876
No!

379
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:16,071
Kill, Yuki!

380
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:18,669
Please save me!

381
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:22,597
I'm sorry. Help me!

382
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,711
Help me!

383
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:27,633
Help me!

384
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:44,069
Good.

385
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:37,039
Let's go.

386
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:57,394
Over there!

387
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:11,714
Cocoe, I promise to follow you.
Wait for me in the Kingdom.

388
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:55,194
I was born amidst a riot.

389
01:07:56,680 --> 01:08:00,753
That was the day
my destiny was decided.

390
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,031
I cannot die.

391
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:06,391
I will not die.

392
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:10,990
For the independence of the
Kingdom!

393
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:13,274
Aki...

394
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:15,189
Saki...

395
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:17,668
Mickey...

396
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,152
Instructor Abe...

397
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:21,629
Mom...

398
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:24,636
Uncle Nakamura...

399
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,715
Watch over me...

400
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:43,509
Yuki...

401
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:56,275
That was the last I saw of Yuki.

402
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:02,273
But I know that somewhere out
there...

403
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:11,195
...Yuki is alive,
watched over by everyone...

404
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:16,958
What do you say?
Want to join the academy too?

405
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:24,032
Yuki, me, and you all...
let us all fight for independence!
