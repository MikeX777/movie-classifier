00:00:04,397 --> 00:00:09,034
(TRAIN WHISTLE)

2
00:00:35,127 --> 00:00:37,206
Tonight, Doctor Craven,
marks the tenth

3
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,240
year of your treating
the young master.

4
00:00:39,264 --> 00:00:41,441
I can still find no cure for the

5
00:00:41,465 --> 00:00:44,444
boy. His ailment
is unprecedented.

6
00:00:44,468 --> 00:00:46,582
Shall we expect you
again tomorrow then?

7
00:00:46,606 --> 00:00:50,609
The day after.
I've business in town.

8
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:08,269
Are we expecting visitors, Mrs.
Medlock?

9
00:01:08,293 --> 00:01:10,672
The Lennox girl is to spend
a few days with us

10
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:14,634
awaiting the arrival of
her mother and father.

11
00:01:24,476 --> 00:01:27,723
I'm here to call on my
uncle, Archibald Craven.

12
00:01:27,747 --> 00:01:29,423
Captain Lennox has no right

13
00:01:29,447 --> 00:01:31,225
dropping his daughter
on our doorstep

14
00:01:31,249 --> 00:01:32,693
just so he can go
gallivanting about

15
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:35,395
India. There's hardly
anything left of it.

16
00:01:35,419 --> 00:01:39,634
Come in Mistress Mary.
We've been expecting you.

17
00:01:39,658 --> 00:01:44,705
Was that..?
Is he..?

18
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,674
That was Doctor Craven.
Lord Archibald's cousin.

19
00:01:47,698 --> 00:01:50,510
He is not the Craven
you're calling on.

20
00:01:50,534 --> 00:01:53,581
I'm glad.
He seems a dour sort.

21
00:01:53,605 --> 00:01:56,618
You may leave your things here.
I'll send Martha to fetch them.

22
00:01:56,642 --> 00:01:57,719
Let us find you a room.

23
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:59,086
My uncle is here then?

24
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:02,190
Aye, but he'll not be
receiving visitors tonight.

25
00:02:02,214 --> 00:02:03,957
Related or otherwise.

26
00:02:03,981 --> 00:02:06,294
I'm told your stay is short.
You'll

27
00:02:06,318 --> 00:02:08,764
likely not cross paths at all.

28
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:11,766
Suits me well enough. I mean
to travel abroad in a few days

29
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,900
and haven't any time for forced

30
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,468
pleasantries with
distant relations.

31
00:02:14,492 --> 00:02:16,872
Well aren't you a pleasant one.

32
00:02:16,896 --> 00:02:19,439
I'm told it runs in the family.

33
00:02:19,463 --> 00:02:22,610
You may not recall, but I
met you once years ago.

34
00:02:22,634 --> 00:02:25,346
You were barely the size
of a daffy-down-dilly.

35
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,546
Where am I to stay?

36
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:30,618
I was told that my uncle
lived in a grand estate.

37
00:02:30,642 --> 00:02:34,890
People once called it grand.
Not so much anymore.

38
00:02:34,914 --> 00:02:39,627
This place slowly went to ruin
after your Aunt Lily passed.

39
00:02:39,651 --> 00:02:44,365
I never knew my Aunt Lily.

40
00:02:44,389 --> 00:02:48,236
You were a wee thing and
probably won't remember

41
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,371
but your mother's sister
was a rare beauty.

42
00:02:50,395 --> 00:02:53,574
Misselthwaite couldn't
survive her loss.

43
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:55,510
Misselthwaite?

44
00:02:55,534 --> 00:02:57,246
It's the place you're in, child.

45
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:01,516
Once the grandest
of all Craven Industries.

46
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,850
Made a rich man out of your

47
00:03:03,874 --> 00:03:06,722
uncle. And his
father before him.

48
00:03:06,746 --> 00:03:10,491
A Craven lives where he works.
It is their way.

49
00:03:10,515 --> 00:03:13,261
Hundreds of people lived
out their lives here.

50
00:03:13,285 --> 00:03:17,898
Now, it's all that's left
of the Craven empire.

51
00:03:17,922 --> 00:03:21,669
(CHIRPING)
What is this?

52
00:03:21,693 --> 00:03:24,573
There's something staring at me
from behind the walls.

53
00:03:24,597 --> 00:03:28,332
Don't tell fictions! Empty
pipes and aging walls is all.

54
00:03:32,304 --> 00:03:35,742
Now keep up.

55
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,557
Here we are, Mistress Mary.
It's the

56
00:03:42,581 --> 00:03:44,959
least crumbling of what's left.

57
00:03:44,983 --> 00:03:48,863
Make yourself at home,
but be glad of the brief stay.

58
00:03:48,887 --> 00:03:52,624
I'll send Martha along with
your things and a hot meal.

59
00:04:20,618 --> 00:04:23,564
For ten years he's seen
to the young master.

60
00:04:23,588 --> 00:04:25,565
And for ten years
the young master

61
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:27,601
has remained in
that wretched room.

62
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,805
If the boy gives
my cousin reason

63
00:04:29,829 --> 00:04:34,108
to call on occasion, so be it.

64
00:04:34,132 --> 00:04:37,878
Only your son stands to inherit
your empire before the Doctor.

65
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:41,840
He may have little motivation
to help the boy.

66
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:53,561
(THUNDER)

67
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:57,389
Mistress Mary? I'm Martha.
I've brought your things.

68
00:05:02,128 --> 00:05:05,640
You may unpack that into there.

69
00:05:05,664 --> 00:05:09,010
You're a funny sort of girl.

70
00:05:09,034 --> 00:05:10,911
Whatever do you mean by funny?

71
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:13,047
(HOWLING WAIL)

72
00:05:13,071 --> 00:05:15,015
What is that unearthly howl?

73
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,817
The steam vents will soon
shut off for the night

74
00:05:17,841 --> 00:05:19,654
so you'll want to
settle in quickly

75
00:05:19,678 --> 00:05:21,656
and bundle up until morning.

76
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,657
It's too cold!

77
00:05:23,681 --> 00:05:25,526
You'll grow used to it in time.

78
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,595
Master Craven hasn't
allowed most of

79
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:31,565
the boilers lit since
Lady Lily died.

80
00:05:31,589 --> 00:05:34,735
Then I should like to speak
to him about that.

81
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:36,671
I'll take my leave
now and be back

82
00:05:36,695 --> 00:05:38,606
with breakfast in the morning.

83
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,608
Will Mrs. Medlock return
to dress me for bed?

84
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:42,543
Can't you dress yourself?

85
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:44,711
I never have in my life.

86
00:05:44,735 --> 00:05:47,915
It'll do you good to
wait on yourself a bit.

87
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:50,519
Good night Miss Mary.

88
00:05:50,543 --> 00:05:54,881
Good night indeed.

89
00:06:09,694 --> 00:06:14,742
I almost forgot. It's been
ages since we had a guest.

90
00:06:14,766 --> 00:06:17,110
This is a Craven
Industries Comm Box.

91
00:06:17,134 --> 00:06:18,778
If you need anything, just push

92
00:06:18,802 --> 00:06:20,480
the button and
speak your wishes.

93
00:06:20,504 --> 00:06:22,583
Someone will hear
and come running.

94
00:06:22,607 --> 00:06:25,519
That's more like it.

95
00:06:25,543 --> 00:06:26,954
Important wishes only.

96
00:06:26,978 --> 00:06:29,059
I'll not run in to tie your
boots or braid your hair.

97
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:34,353
But if you need extra blankets
or a good story, just ring.

98
00:06:38,723 --> 00:06:40,600
What of my niece?
I'm told the Lenox

99
00:06:40,624 --> 00:06:42,603
girl has arrived unaccompanied.

100
00:06:42,627 --> 00:06:45,605
She is to join her family at the
railway depot in three days.

101
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:46,874
I've already informed her that

102
00:06:46,898 --> 00:06:48,844
you'll likely not
see one another.

103
00:06:48,868 --> 00:06:51,012
Was she agreeable?

104
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,947
In general, no.

105
00:06:52,971 --> 00:06:55,015
But regarding that
particular subject

106
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,884
she seemed to pay it no mind.

107
00:06:56,908 --> 00:06:59,488
Then we'll speak no
more of it until

108
00:06:59,512 --> 00:07:03,516
you've informed me
of her departure.

109

(FACTORY WHISTLE)

110
00:07:37,549 --> 00:07:42,063
COMM BOX: All rise for
work day number 219,672

111
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:46,801
at Craven Industries
Misselthwaite Factory.

112
00:07:46,825 --> 00:07:48,169
What is that?

113
00:07:48,193 --> 00:07:49,337
Porridge with
treacle and hot tea

114
00:07:49,361 --> 00:07:50,370
to start your
morning, Miss Mary.

115
00:07:50,394 --> 00:07:55,009
No. That.
That horrible noise.

116
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:57,811
There was a time this factory
had hundreds of workers.

117
00:07:57,835 --> 00:08:01,648
The Comm Box talked them awake
and talked them to work.

118
00:08:01,672 --> 00:08:05,085
There's not many of us
left to hear it anymore.

119
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:09,991
Well does it do that every day?
You must make it stop.

120
00:08:10,015 --> 00:08:11,959
I suppose it could be stopped.
But

121
00:08:11,983 --> 00:08:13,627
we've only one
full time mechanic

122
00:08:13,651 --> 00:08:15,161
left these days and
it's all he can

123
00:08:15,185 --> 00:08:16,629
do to keep the
steam vents going.

124
00:08:16,653 --> 00:08:20,266
Making those announcements is
a proud tradition for him.

125
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:25,238
Give me his name. I should like
to speak with him at once.

126
00:08:25,262 --> 00:08:27,708
Ben Weatherstaff is the
one you're looking

127
00:08:27,732 --> 00:08:29,743
for, but good luck
tracking him down.

128
00:08:29,767 --> 00:08:32,246
Tracking him down?
Send him to me.

129
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:35,882
You are an odd girl,
Mistress Mary.

130
00:08:35,906 --> 00:08:38,084
The staff of Misselthwaite
seem painfully unaware

131
00:08:38,108 --> 00:08:40,955
of the duties that
their stations require.

132
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,923
I'll send Martha by
with lunch at noon.

133
00:08:42,947 --> 00:08:46,127
You're welcome to dress yourself
and walk the nearby corridor but

134
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:50,690
don't stray too far.

135
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,011
Seeking Ben Weatherstaff. Ben

136
00:09:04,035 --> 00:09:06,380
Weatherstaff, please
respond at once.

138
00:09:08,772 --> 00:09:09,772
Are you Ben Weatherstaff?

139
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,887
I need him to come and
silence this box at once.

140
00:09:12,911 --> 00:09:14,655
Oh. do you now?

141
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,625
Well, he's a very busy man,
Ben Weatherstaff.

142
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:19,859
MARY: Where might
I find him then?

143
00:09:19,883 --> 00:09:21,829
He's most likely
in workshop five,

144
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,797
pounding on some
pipe or another,

145
00:09:23,821 --> 00:09:26,633
and he loves nothing
more than visitors.

146
00:09:26,657 --> 00:09:29,035
And where might I find
this workshop five?

147
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:30,670
VOICE: Just follow
the blue pipes

148
00:09:30,694 --> 00:09:31,838
and you'll find him alright.

149
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:36,643
BEN: Boy! Stop fiddling
with the machines!

150
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:40,804
Hello?
Where is this blue pipe?

151
00:10:14,705 --> 00:10:20,720
Excuse me.

152
00:10:20,744 --> 00:10:25,159
Are you the one who can silence
the box from waking me?

153
00:10:25,183 --> 00:10:26,694
I've two more days
before my parents

154
00:10:26,718 --> 00:10:27,918
come to take me away from this

155
00:10:28,352 --> 00:10:31,364
dreadful place and I'd prefer to
spend the mornings asleep.

156
00:10:31,388 --> 00:10:36,170
You know, I met you once,
when you were a wee thing

157
00:10:36,194 --> 00:10:40,131
unable to talk. I like you
even less now.

158
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:48,883
If you must have it shut off,
find the young lad, Dickon.

159
00:10:48,907 --> 00:10:51,385
He'll know what to do.

160
00:10:51,409 --> 00:10:57,357
Is your name really
Ben Weatherstaff?

161
00:10:57,381 --> 00:11:01,862
It is. Have you got a problem
with that and all?

162
00:11:01,886 --> 00:11:02,963
No.

163
00:11:02,987 --> 00:11:04,832
Good.

164
00:11:04,856 --> 00:11:07,935
It's peculiar is all.

165
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:12,907
Peculiar. I weren't always
called such.

166
00:11:12,931 --> 00:11:15,141
It's on account of
my staff, see. Not

167
00:11:15,165 --> 00:11:17,744
that it's got ought
to do with you.

168
00:11:17,768 --> 00:11:24,885
Why? What's so special about it?

169
00:11:24,909 --> 00:11:28,888
It's nothing more than the
fallen branch of a tree.

170
00:11:28,912 --> 00:11:30,757
Oh is it now? Does every fallen

171
00:11:30,781 --> 00:11:32,825
branch of a tree
give you the power

172
00:11:32,849 --> 00:11:34,962
to call and calm the storm?

173
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,131
You can't possibly be serious.

174
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:42,302
You must think me a child
who believes in faerie stories.

175
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:46,073
Away with thee now! I've wasted
enough of my precious time.

176
00:11:46,097 --> 00:11:49,343
I've got work to do here,
can't you see?

177
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:54,005
(FOOTSTEPS)

178
00:12:00,944 --> 00:12:06,059
Doctor Craven. We weren't
expecting you until tomorrow.

179
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,529
There's been a change of plans.

180
00:12:08,553 --> 00:12:12,565
Find the Lennox girl. My cousin
will want to speak with her.

181
00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:17,938
Immediately, Mrs. Medlock.

182
00:12:17,962 --> 00:12:20,239
Well then where do I find
this Dickon?

183
00:12:20,263 --> 00:12:22,209
Is he the voice who
sent me here?

184
00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:30,233
He is. Aye.

185
00:12:30,308 --> 00:12:33,219
Unless you'd rather the boilers
die and us all freeze to death

186
00:12:33,243 --> 00:12:36,857
you'll put that down!

187
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,092
Mistress Mary! Mrs.
Medlock, she's here!

188
00:12:39,116 --> 00:12:43,121
You're to see your
uncle right away.

189
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:54,998
This is as far as I go.

190
00:12:58,268 --> 00:13:01,915
Step forward, girl.

191
00:13:01,939 --> 00:13:07,119
My cousin has brought
disturbing news from town.

192
00:13:07,143 --> 00:13:09,156
Your parents were on a chartered

193
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,123
airship from India
and it vanished

194
00:13:11,147 --> 00:13:14,060
somewhere over the Arabian Sea.

195
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:20,334
News has only just
reached these shores.

196
00:13:20,358 --> 00:13:26,540
I haven't any other
family to take me in.

197
00:13:26,564 --> 00:13:29,175
Even so, I will leave
in three days,

198
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:32,345
as my father and
mother promised you.

199
00:13:32,369 --> 00:13:34,146
You'll be cared for here until

200
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:36,149
you're old enough
to be on your own.

201
00:13:36,173 --> 00:13:38,551
I prefer not to become a burden.

202
00:13:38,575 --> 00:13:40,152
If your parents are
truly gone then

203
00:13:40,176 --> 00:13:41,954
your guardianship falls to me.

204
00:13:41,978 --> 00:13:44,891
You'll remain here
at Misselthwaite.

205
00:13:44,915 --> 00:13:47,493
Now you must go.
I'm tired. I have a long journey

206
00:13:47,517 --> 00:13:48,594
ahead of me and I'll be gone for

207
00:13:48,618 --> 00:13:50,162
several days but Mrs.
Medlock will

208
00:13:50,186 --> 00:13:51,931
see to it that you're cared for.

209
00:13:51,955 --> 00:13:56,393
(BELL RINGS)

210
00:14:00,964 --> 00:14:05,335
I'd forgotten you.

211
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:21,160
Mrs. Medlock!

212
00:14:21,184 --> 00:14:24,164
A word, please.

213
00:14:24,188 --> 00:14:28,827
Of course.

214
00:14:37,601 --> 00:14:39,713
I don't approve of
this situation.

215
00:14:39,737 --> 00:14:40,737
How do you mean?

216
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,684
The Lennox family were always
financially reckless.

217
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,352
It's highly likely they've left

218
00:14:45,376 --> 00:14:47,353
their daughter with
no inheritance.

219
00:14:47,377 --> 00:14:49,189
The girl hardly
sounded as though

220
00:14:49,213 --> 00:14:50,958
she wished to remain here.

221
00:14:50,982 --> 00:14:53,993
Do you believe she intends
to profit by it?

222
00:14:54,017 --> 00:14:56,028
I intend to find out.

223
00:14:56,052 --> 00:14:58,231
Have you told Lord Craven?

224
00:14:58,255 --> 00:15:02,135
Absolutely not, and
neither will you.

225
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:05,372
Archibald is too soft.

226
00:15:05,396 --> 00:15:07,540
It might not seem
so, but he'd have

227
00:15:07,564 --> 00:15:11,869
the child in his
will if she asked.

228
00:15:17,141 --> 00:15:19,719
Your mother and father must have
been very important

229
00:15:19,743 --> 00:15:22,388
to book passage on an airship.

230
00:15:22,412 --> 00:15:25,125
I suppose.

231
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:27,728
I hardly knew them.

232
00:15:27,752 --> 00:15:30,630
Hardly knew them?

233
00:15:30,654 --> 00:15:35,768
I've been raised by servants
and nannies most of my life.

234
00:15:35,792 --> 00:15:40,406
Perhaps my Aya loved me.

235
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:44,176
But she died when I
was very little.

236
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,781
Will you stay with us
here at Misselthwaite?

237
00:15:48,805 --> 00:15:50,784
No. I shall explore
this place while

238
00:15:50,808 --> 00:15:52,685
I am certain that
my uncle is gone

239
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:55,721
and leave before he returns.

240
00:15:55,745 --> 00:15:58,257
I do wish you'd stay.

241
00:15:58,281 --> 00:16:02,429
I think we might be friends.

242
00:16:02,453 --> 00:16:07,732
I've never had a friend.
Besides Dickon.

243
00:16:07,756 --> 00:16:10,303
Who is this Dickon?
Everyone speaks

244
00:16:10,327 --> 00:16:12,638
of him, but he's never around.

245
00:16:12,662 --> 00:16:15,107
Dickon is my younger brother.

246
00:16:15,131 --> 00:16:16,776
He's usually off
by himself playing

247
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,678
in some dark corner
of the factory.

248
00:16:18,702 --> 00:16:21,080
He wants to be a mechanic
like Ben Weatherstaff.

249
00:16:21,104 --> 00:16:22,616
But, Ben says
there'll be no more

250
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,453
mechanics here at Misselthwaite.

251
00:16:26,477 --> 00:16:29,387
I wonder what Dickon
would think of you.

252
00:16:29,411 --> 00:16:34,560
He wouldn't like me.
No one does.

253
00:16:34,584 --> 00:16:38,165
How do you like yourself?

254
00:16:38,189 --> 00:16:41,500
Not at all really.

255
00:16:41,524 --> 00:16:44,737
But I never thought
of it before.

256
00:16:44,761 --> 00:16:48,465
Stay out of trouble. And ring
Mrs. Medlock if you need to.

257
00:17:11,122 --> 00:17:15,159
No. Dickon wouldn't
like me at all.

258
00:17:24,134 --> 00:17:28,605
(CHIRPING)

259
00:17:45,854 --> 00:17:50,527
(CHIRPING)

260
00:17:59,602 --> 00:18:07,154
Hello?

261
00:18:07,178 --> 00:18:13,224
(CHIRPING)

262
00:18:13,248 --> 00:18:16,363
There you are!

264
00:18:18,455 --> 00:18:20,533
But how did you get in there?

(CHIRPING)

266
00:18:22,525 --> 00:18:27,230
Wait!

(KNOCKING)

268
00:18:41,778 --> 00:18:44,789
You could at least be that
young lad, Dickon.

269
00:18:44,813 --> 00:18:46,892
He's always begging for one
task or another but then

270
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:51,463
when you truly need him,
nowhere to be seen.

271
00:18:51,487 --> 00:18:53,898
I'm beginning to doubt
that he exists.

272
00:18:53,922 --> 00:18:55,734
Just you wait for
a moment in time

273
00:18:55,758 --> 00:18:57,068
when all you want is a little

274
00:18:57,092 --> 00:19:01,575
cup of quiet or the tiniest
little sliver of peace.

275
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:03,877
He'll come running along.
Just as

276
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:07,681
sure as can be,
he'll come running.

277
00:19:07,705 --> 00:19:12,851
Well. Is that it, girl?

278
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:20,393
How does one open a lock
when one doesn't have a key?

279
00:19:20,417 --> 00:19:23,362
I've got no time for riddles.
I'm busy.

280
00:19:23,386 --> 00:19:25,698
It isn't a riddle.

281
00:19:25,722 --> 00:19:27,500
I've discovered a lock.

282
00:19:27,524 --> 00:19:30,935
And there's over a thousand
rooms in this factory.

283
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:35,131
It's a lock in a corridor
of yellow pipes.

284
00:19:43,373 --> 00:19:46,684
You mustn't go poking about
in there. It isn't safe.

285
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:47,953
I wasn't poking about.

286
00:19:47,977 --> 00:19:50,256
A flying machine
led me there and

287
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,391
chirped at me from
the other side.

288
00:19:52,415 --> 00:19:56,529
You've met the R.O.B.I.N.
That's good luck!

289
00:19:56,553 --> 00:19:58,531
Met the what?

290
00:19:58,555 --> 00:20:05,671
The R.O.B.I.N.
Don't you know?

291
00:20:05,695 --> 00:20:10,509
Remotely Operated Binary
Industrial Node.

292
00:20:10,533 --> 00:20:14,947
It's quite the mouthful, so we
just call them R.O.B.I.N.s.

293
00:20:14,971 --> 00:20:18,416
There are others?

294
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,656
Oh, Misselthwaite used
to be full of 'em.

295
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,692
Mrs. Craven brought
them all to life here.

296
00:20:26,716 --> 00:20:29,627
Lord Craven shut 'em all down
when the factory closed.

297
00:20:29,651 --> 00:20:34,768
But this one, he refused to be
shut down and he kept on flying.

298
00:20:34,792 --> 00:20:40,307
He's what we call autonomous.

299
00:20:40,331 --> 00:20:41,774
Autonomous?

300
00:20:41,798 --> 00:20:44,542
Aye. It means... it
means he does what

301
00:20:44,566 --> 00:20:47,313
he wants, takes
orders from nobody.

302
00:20:47,337 --> 00:20:49,748
(CHIRPING)

303
00:20:49,772 --> 00:20:52,618
He knows we're talking
about him. He's

304
00:20:52,642 --> 00:20:55,087
conceited, that one is.
I tell ya.

305
00:20:55,111 --> 00:20:58,858
Likes to hear folk
talking about him.

306
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:00,859
He's curious, too.

307
00:21:00,883 --> 00:21:03,996
He always pops his head in here,
see what I'm fixin'.

308
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:08,733
(FACTORY WHISTLE)

309
00:21:08,757 --> 00:21:14,039
Well, save from duty rosters,
that'll be the end of my day.

310
00:21:14,063 --> 00:21:15,641
Suspect that young
maid will be looking

311
00:21:15,665 --> 00:21:17,344
for you to fetch
you some supper.

312
00:21:17,368 --> 00:21:18,844
Will I see him again?

313
00:21:18,868 --> 00:21:23,673
Aye. You'll see him again. As
long as he's of mind to be seen.

314
00:21:27,043 --> 00:21:29,020
I'd wrap up warm
and cozy this eve

315
00:21:29,044 --> 00:21:30,789
if I were thee, Mistress Mary.

316
00:21:30,813 --> 00:21:33,858
I have half a notion
to call upon a

317
00:21:33,882 --> 00:21:36,929
northwesterly wind
to sing me to sleep.

318
00:21:36,953 --> 00:21:40,699
Don't go poking around
that yellow corridor.

319
00:21:40,723 --> 00:21:44,802
Your uncle sealed that workshop
off for his own reasons.

320
00:21:44,826 --> 00:21:49,265
But why?
What reasons?

321
00:22:02,445 --> 00:22:05,925
Why would my uncle lock up
an entire workshop?

322
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:10,529
Mrs. Medlock said that's
not to be talked about.

323
00:22:10,553 --> 00:22:12,665
But Mrs. Medlock isn't here.

324
00:22:12,689 --> 00:22:14,032
There are lots of things in this

325
00:22:14,056 --> 00:22:15,667
place that's not
to be talked over.

326
00:22:15,691 --> 00:22:18,103
That's Lord Craven's orders.

327
00:22:18,127 --> 00:22:21,106
He's given no such order to me.

328
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:25,878
I've hardly even
spoken with him.

329
00:22:25,902 --> 00:22:28,814
It was Lily Craven's workshop.

330
00:22:28,838 --> 00:22:29,714
There was a time
when she believed

331
00:22:29,738 --> 00:22:30,549
she couldn't bear any children

332
00:22:30,573 --> 00:22:32,718
and her heart was broken.

333
00:22:32,742 --> 00:22:34,421
As a happy diversion,
Lord Craven

334
00:22:34,445 --> 00:22:35,754
gave her the space to work in

335
00:22:35,778 --> 00:22:39,692
and she just loved it.
She called it her garden.

336
00:22:39,716 --> 00:22:42,162
A garden inside of a factory?

337
00:22:42,186 --> 00:22:45,165
Ben Weatherstaff says it was a
mechanical sort of garden

338
00:22:45,189 --> 00:22:48,600
for cultivating her inventions.

339
00:22:48,624 --> 00:22:51,569
What kinds of things
did she invent?

340
00:22:51,593 --> 00:22:54,205
I only know the bits
Mrs. Medlock has told me.

341
00:22:54,229 --> 00:22:59,778
I was younger than you
when it... happened.

342
00:22:59,802 --> 00:23:02,182
Years ago, before
either of us were born,

343
00:23:02,206 --> 00:23:04,582
people grew the most
beautiful plants.

344
00:23:04,606 --> 00:23:08,052
Full of colors and smells.
You could even eat them.

345
00:23:08,076 --> 00:23:11,723
But then the wars came.
And set the skies on fire.

346
00:23:11,747 --> 00:23:14,126
And the smogs rolled
in and made most

347
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:16,595

348
00:23:16,619 --> 00:23:18,998
Well, Lily Craven
took it upon herself

349
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:21,000
to create new sorts of things

350
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:25,738
that could grow and thrive,
even inside of a factory.

351
00:23:25,762 --> 00:23:28,607
I should like to see
this secret garden.

352
00:23:28,631 --> 00:23:30,142

353
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:34,012

bring life to her garden,

356
00:23:38,908 --> 00:23:41,654
Lily Craven hid herself
away in the workshop

357
00:23:41,678 --> 00:23:44,923
and released a tank of
her experimental mixture.

358
00:23:44,947 --> 00:23:48,227
Only, something went wrong,
and the air was

359
00:23:48,251 --> 00:23:53,264
even more poisonous than
what she started with.

360
00:23:53,288 --> 00:23:56,769
When the factory's R.O.B.I.N.
drones detected the problem,

361
00:23:56,793 --> 00:24:00,172
every door at Misselthwaite
was instantly locked shut.

362
00:24:00,196 --> 00:24:02,608
By the time the
poison vented out

363
00:24:02,632 --> 00:24:04,910
of the factory, it was too late.

364
00:24:04,934 --> 00:24:07,046
Lord Craven had the
room sealed and shut

365
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,647
and deactivated all
of the R.O.B.I.N.s,

366
00:24:09,671 --> 00:24:13,085

not rescuing Lily.

up on all of Misselthwaite.

around the factory.

down one of those

told you that story.

It is someone crying!

Martha didn't tell me where the

Of course she didn't because
you heard no sounds.

earlier today than usual.

00:34:08,403 --> 00:34:10,147
they take a turn for the worse.

521
00:34:10,171 --> 00:34:12,181
We thought it best to
call you right away.

522
00:34:12,205 --> 00:34:16,011
Of course. That was the right
choice, Mrs. Medlock.

523
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:22,861
What business have you to be
snooping about in there?

524
00:34:22,885 --> 00:34:24,094
I happen to live here now.

525
00:34:24,118 --> 00:34:26,497
I instructed you to
keep to your quarters.

526
00:34:26,521 --> 00:34:27,798
I was only looking
for the R.O.B.I.N.

527
00:34:27,822 --> 00:34:28,931
I shall continue
to look elsewhere.

528
00:34:28,955 --> 00:34:30,833
I thought the last
of those wretched

530
00:34:32,327 --> 00:34:34,204
Well don't look to me.

00:34:34,228 --> 00:34:36,607
It's none of my affair
what is or is not activated.

532

Take me to my patient. I've a
schedule that must be kept to.

533
00:34:40,202 --> 00:34:42,613
If it were my affair
there would be no

534
00:34:42,637 --> 00:34:46,574

unwelcome house guests.

but a tweak of your blankets
and up you shoot.

It's hardly past midnight.

545
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,609
Surely you haven't
brought breakfast already.

546
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,910
No, Miss Mary. I've returned
from my day off

547
00:36:19,934 --> 00:36:22,247
and only meant to see that
you were sleeping proper.

548
00:36:22,271 --> 00:36:28,986
Well, I was.

549
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:31,021
What do you think?

550
00:36:31,045 --> 00:36:32,723
I've brought you a gift.

551
00:36:32,747 --> 00:36:36,928
A gift?

552
00:36:36,952 --> 00:36:39,296
It's adorable.

553
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,932
What is it?

554
00:36:40,956 --> 00:36:44,400
This is Astrid.

555
00:36:44,424 --> 00:36:45,969
Whatever is it for?

556
00:36:45,993 --> 00:36:48,006
Haven't you ever had a doll?

557
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,972
No.

558
00:36:49,996 --> 00:36:52,276
Dickon gave her me
after our first visit

559
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,544
to the factory, when
we were very little.

560
00:36:54,568 --> 00:36:57,813
She'll keep you safe.
She's a good companion.

561
00:36:57,837 --> 00:37:01,819
No one has ever given
me a gift before.

562
00:37:01,843 --> 00:37:04,621
Not even your mother and father?

563
00:37:04,645 --> 00:37:07,557
Certainly not.

564
00:37:07,581 --> 00:37:09,525
Won't you miss her terribly?

565
00:37:09,549 --> 00:37:12,795
I'll visit her now and then.
She's a bit worn.

566
00:37:12,819 --> 00:37:15,831
Your Aunt Lily made her.

567
00:37:15,855 --> 00:37:16,855
How do you know?

568
00:37:17,791 --> 00:37:21,562
That's her mark. She used it on
most of her inventions.

569
00:37:30,604 --> 00:37:35,319
Thank you.

570
00:37:35,343 --> 00:37:37,488
It's Dickon who ought
to be thanked.

571
00:37:37,512 --> 00:37:42,726
He patched Astrid up from scraps
he's collected here and there.

572
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:46,522
Now back to bed with you.
I'll see you in the morning.

Dickon! Is that you?

00:38:42,677 --> 00:38:45,521
The R.O.B.I.N. told
me you found the key.

589
00:38:45,545 --> 00:38:47,456
He showed it to me.

590
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,560
Oh did he now?

591
00:38:49,584 --> 00:38:53,397
He never let on he knew
where it was.

592
00:38:53,421 --> 00:38:56,833
Do you understand what
the R.O.B.I.N. says?

593
00:38:56,857 --> 00:39:00,571
I think I do.
And he thinks I do.

594
00:39:00,595 --> 00:39:02,938
I've worked with
machines so long,

595
00:39:02,962 --> 00:39:04,940
they think I'm one of them.

596
00:39:04,964 --> 00:39:07,412
How did you get in there?

597
00:39:07,436 --> 00:39:08,811
Can't you climb out?

598
00:39:08,835 --> 00:39:11,682
Of course I can. But not here.

00:40:11,931 --> 00:40:19,048
Ben Weatherstaff is headed
this way. Come with me.

609
00:40:19,072 --> 00:40:25,922

00:40:38,225 --> 00:40:40,637
What is this place?

612
00:40:40,661 --> 00:40:42,905
This is my hideout.

613
00:40:42,929 --> 00:40:45,108
I do all my most
important work here.

614
00:40:45,132 --> 00:40:48,644
Well who are you hiding from?

615
00:40:48,668 --> 00:40:51,081
There's no more jobs for
mechanics at the factory and

616
00:40:51,105 --> 00:40:53,517
Ben Weatherstaff won't
take on an apprentice.

617
00:40:53,541 --> 00:40:56,053
But I still like to tinker
and make repairs.

618
00:40:56,077 --> 00:40:57,721
Especially for the R.O.B.I.N.

619
00:40:57,745 --> 00:41:00,657
Would my uncle be angry
if he caught you here?

620
00:41:00,681 --> 00:41:05,796
I prefer not to find out.

621
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:10,024
Can I have a look at that key?

622
00:41:14,829 --> 00:41:17,206
It's the key to the sealed up
workshop, isn't it?

623
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:20,143
It's the key to every workshop.

624
00:41:20,167 --> 00:41:21,945
To every room, closet, and

625
00:41:21,969 --> 00:41:24,246
cupboard in all
of Misselthwaite.

626
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:26,816
When I was very little,
I used to climb

627
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,819
through the vents
into that workshop

628
00:41:28,843 --> 00:41:30,853
and read your Aunt Lily's notes.

629
00:41:30,877 --> 00:41:36,226
She had so many wonderful ideas.
Including this key.

630
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:38,894
What's the matter?

631
00:41:38,918 --> 00:41:42,934
When I grew up a bit, I couldn't
fit through the pipe anymore.

632
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:45,969
I haven't been to that shop
in a long time.

633
00:41:45,993 --> 00:41:48,573
But if this key
exists, maybe she

634
00:41:48,597 --> 00:41:50,974
created some of
the other things.

635
00:41:50,998 --> 00:41:54,777
Martha told me that
she tried to create plants.

636
00:41:54,801 --> 00:41:57,047
Do you think that
she really did it?

637
00:41:57,071 --> 00:42:01,510
We can certainly find out.

638
00:42:45,386 --> 00:42:50,024
How still it is.

639
00:42:54,195 --> 00:42:57,642
This place was her garden.

640
00:42:57,666 --> 00:43:04,915
Never thought I'd see it again.

641
00:43:04,939 --> 00:43:08,784
Is it all quite a dead garden?

642
00:43:08,808 --> 00:43:14,257
I wish it wasn't.

643
00:43:14,281 --> 00:43:22,281
There's still some life here.

644
00:43:22,455 --> 00:43:27,369
Look here.
The vines are hollow tubes.

645
00:43:27,393 --> 00:43:32,943
It's full of tiny vents.
But why?

646
00:43:32,967 --> 00:43:39,248
It's part mechanical.
Look.

647
00:43:39,272 --> 00:43:43,109
The vines are connected
to the central boiler line.

648
00:44:45,806 --> 00:44:49,418
This is where I found Astrid.

649
00:44:49,442 --> 00:44:53,188
I wish that I could put the rest
of her back together.

650
00:44:53,212 --> 00:44:56,358
But I've never
worked with anything

651
00:44:56,382 --> 00:44:59,228
mechanical my entire life.

652
00:44:59,252 --> 00:45:03,033
All we need is a little bit of
steam to run through the pipes

653
00:45:03,057 --> 00:45:05,501
and we could get things
growing proper again.

654
00:45:05,525 --> 00:45:08,204
But my uncle hasn't
allowed many of the

655
00:45:08,228 --> 00:45:10,373
boilers lit since
my Aunt Lily died.

656
00:45:10,397 --> 00:45:18,047
That's true. But we could
solve that problem.

657
00:45:18,071 --> 00:45:21,784
Will you come again
and help me to do it?

658
00:45:21,808 --> 00:45:23,452
I'm sure that I can help, too.

659
00:45:23,476 --> 00:45:25,355
I'll come every day
if you want me.

We'll spend the day at work
in the garden.

I've seen Dickon.
He showed me his hideout.

671
00:46:18,632 --> 00:46:22,846
I knew you'd cross paths.
He's a fine lad.

672
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:24,414
I'm going to see him
again tomorrow.

673
00:46:24,438 --> 00:46:26,449
He's helping me finish
constructing the doll.

674
00:46:26,473 --> 00:46:29,985
Oh? I know he's got chores
for mother tomorrow.

675
00:46:30,009 --> 00:46:34,990
He probably won't have time
for coming around here.

676

crawling through

678
00:46:40,152 --> 00:46:44,399
Oh, yes. It isn't the cleanest
way around, I suppose.

679
00:46:44,423 --> 00:46:46,902
I'll take it with me tonight and

680
00:46:46,926 --> 00:46:49,472
have it back good
as new by morning.

681
00:46:49,496 --> 00:46:52,175
Oh, no, no. That
won't be necessary.

hear the end of it

(WAILING)

696
00:49:55,482 --> 00:49:57,693
Who are you?

697
00:49:57,717 --> 00:50:01,097
Were you crying?

698
00:50:01,121 --> 00:50:03,199
Are you a ghost?

699
00:50:03,223 --> 00:50:05,802
You don't look as though
you've been crying.

700
00:50:05,826 --> 00:50:09,739
I am Colin. Are you a ghost?

701
00:50:09,763 --> 00:50:13,208
I am Mary Lennox.
I am not a ghost.

702
00:50:13,232 --> 00:50:15,142
Why are you here?

703
00:50:15,166 --> 00:50:19,315
I live here.
Archibald Craven is my uncle.

704
00:50:19,339 --> 00:50:21,384
Archibald Craven is my father.

705
00:50:21,408 --> 00:50:27,090
Your father? No one told me that
he had a boy. Why wouldn't they?

706
00:50:27,114 --> 00:50:31,585
Come here.

707
00:50:36,255 --> 00:50:37,733
Where did you come from?

708
00:50:37,757 --> 00:50:40,335
My own room.

709
00:50:40,359 --> 00:50:42,771
The thunder wouldn't
let me sleep.

710
00:50:42,795 --> 00:50:47,274
And I heard someone crying and I
wanted to find out who it was.

711
00:50:47,298 --> 00:50:49,478
What were you crying for?

712
00:50:49,502 --> 00:50:53,180
Because I can't sleep either
and my head aches.

713
00:50:53,204 --> 00:50:54,750
Tell me your name again.

714
00:50:54,774 --> 00:50:56,718
Mary Lennox.

715
00:50:56,742 --> 00:50:58,887
Did no one tell you that I'd
come to live here?

716
00:50:58,911 --> 00:51:01,288
No. They dare not.

717
00:51:01,312 --> 00:51:02,312
Why?

718
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:05,128
Because I should have been
afraid you would see me.

719
00:51:05,152 --> 00:51:09,532
I won't let people see me
or talk me over.

720
00:51:09,556 --> 00:51:10,556
Why?

721
00:51:11,524 --> 00:51:14,804
Because I am always like this.
Unable to walk.

722
00:51:14,828 --> 00:51:18,373
My father won't let people see
me or talk me over either.

723
00:51:18,397 --> 00:51:21,308
The servants are not allowed to
speak about me.

724
00:51:21,332 --> 00:51:26,282
What a strange place this is!
Everything is kept a secret.

725
00:51:26,306 --> 00:51:29,184
Workshops are locked up.
Gardens are locked up.

726
00:51:29,208 --> 00:51:31,554
And you. Are you locked up, too?

727
00:51:31,578 --> 00:51:33,722
No. I stay in this
room because I

728
00:51:33,746 --> 00:51:36,893
do not wish to be moved around.

729
00:51:36,917 --> 00:51:39,896
Does your father come
and see you then?

730
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:44,433
My mother died and it makes my
father sad to look at me.

731
00:51:44,457 --> 00:51:46,936
He thinks I don't know,
but I've heard them talking.

732
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:51,273
They say I'm not going to live
long, which is just as well.

733
00:51:51,297 --> 00:51:53,774
I do not want to be a hunchback
like my father.

734
00:51:53,798 --> 00:51:58,181
I think he knows this and
he hates me for it.

735
00:51:58,205 --> 00:52:01,751
He hates the garden, too.

736
00:52:01,775 --> 00:52:05,755
Because she died.

737
00:52:05,779 --> 00:52:08,324
That's why he locked the door.

738
00:52:08,348 --> 00:52:11,960
Locked what door?

739
00:52:11,984 --> 00:52:15,398
Just a door... to
a workshop that

740
00:52:15,422 --> 00:52:18,701
your father hates.
Nothing, really.

741
00:52:18,725 --> 00:52:22,605
Why do they think
that you won't live?

742
00:52:22,629 --> 00:52:25,272
I've seen the doctor here.
Can't he help you?

743
00:52:25,296 --> 00:52:28,476
My doctor is my father's cousin.

744
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:29,945
If I die, he shall have all

745
00:52:29,969 --> 00:52:31,880
Misselthwaite when
my father is dead.

746
00:52:31,904 --> 00:52:37,485
I should think he wouldn't
want me to live.

747
00:52:37,509 --> 00:52:40,754
Why do you keep looking
at me like that?

748
00:52:40,778 --> 00:52:44,926
Do you see the curtain
hanging on the wall?

749
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:45,950
Yes.

750
00:52:46,553 --> 00:52:51,190
Go and open it.

751
00:53:00,533 --> 00:53:03,944
That is all that I know of her.

752
00:53:03,968 --> 00:53:05,946
Your mother?

753
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:10,619
If she had lived, I believe
I would not have been ill.

754
00:53:10,643 --> 00:53:13,388
I dare say I might have even
been able to walk.

755
00:53:13,412 --> 00:53:17,726
She made this doll, too.

756
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:22,297
I believe it was one
of her last creations.

757
00:53:22,321 --> 00:53:23,797
Draw the curtain again.

758
00:53:23,821 --> 00:53:31,373
I do not want to see her
looking at me anymore.

759
00:53:31,397 --> 00:53:38,446
I should go. I've been here
far too long.

760
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:43,552
I want you to come and speak
to me every day.

761
00:53:43,576 --> 00:53:45,720
I will come as often as I can.

762
00:53:45,744 --> 00:53:48,422
You must look every day
for the locked door.

763
00:53:48,446 --> 00:53:51,326
I should like to see that place.

764
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:56,464
Perhaps I might find a way
to get in sometime.

765
00:53:56,488 --> 00:54:01,603
Perhaps we might find a boy
who could carry you in there.

766
00:54:01,627 --> 00:54:05,332
And we could go and it would
just be kept a secret garden.

(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

768
00:54:30,521 --> 00:54:34,468
Come in.

769
00:54:34,492 --> 00:54:38,606
Miss Mary! I've never known you
to be up and about so early.

770
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:40,475
I haven't even prepared
your breakfast.

771
00:54:40,499 --> 00:54:43,511
I was only hoping to come
and get my vest.

772
00:54:43,535 --> 00:54:47,506
Of course!
I've just finished mending it.

773
00:55:00,619 --> 00:55:04,632
Be more careful with
important things.

774
00:55:04,656 --> 00:55:09,371
I will.

775
00:55:09,395 --> 00:55:10,395
I promise.

776
00:55:11,095 --> 00:55:12,506
And don't let Dickon
get you into trouble.

777
00:55:12,530 --> 00:55:18,979
He's a sweet boy, but his
curiosity gets the best of him.

778
00:55:19,003 --> 00:55:21,915
I found out what the crying was.

779
00:55:21,939 --> 00:55:24,451
You haven't. Never.

00:55:27,513 --> 00:55:31,816
What have you done?

782
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:52,882
I'm sorry, Master Colin.
I didn't

783
00:55:52,906 --> 00:55:54,649
tell Mistress Mary
where to find you.

784
00:55:54,673 --> 00:55:56,850
I want Mary Lennox to come
and speak to me.

785
00:55:56,874 --> 00:55:58,486
You do?

786
00:55:58,510 --> 00:56:00,688
And you are not to tell anyone.

787
00:56:00,712 --> 00:56:03,425
But Mrs. Medlock
ordered me to never...

788
00:56:03,449 --> 00:56:05,826
Have you to do what I please
or have you not?

789
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:07,695
I have to do what
you please, sir.

790
00:56:07,719 --> 00:56:10,564
Has Medlock to do what I please?

791
00:56:10,588 --> 00:56:13,033
Everybody has, sir.

792
00:56:13,057 --> 00:56:16,929
Well. Then I order you to
bring Mary Lennox to me.

793
00:56:32,544 --> 00:56:34,088
The world's coming to an end!

794
00:56:34,112 --> 00:56:35,112
What is it?

795
00:56:35,881 --> 00:56:36,726
You better come as
quick as you can.

796
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:37,826
If Mrs. Medlock find out, she'll

797
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:39,960
think I broke orders
and told you.

798
00:56:39,984 --> 00:56:41,129
I'll lose my place.

799
00:56:41,153 --> 00:56:42,997
No, you won't lose your place.

800
00:56:43,021 --> 00:56:44,866
I'm the one who heard
the crying in the night

801
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:46,600
and I got up and
found Colin myself.

802
00:56:46,624 --> 00:56:48,670
He was glad that I came.

803
00:56:48,694 --> 00:56:50,604
He won't let strangers
look at him.

804
00:56:50,628 --> 00:56:52,640
He let me look at him.

805
00:56:52,664 --> 00:56:53,808
What's that matter with him?

806
00:56:53,832 --> 00:56:55,877
I wasn't told of him
until a year ago.

807
00:56:55,901 --> 00:56:57,712
After Lady Lily
died, Lord Craven

808
00:56:57,736 --> 00:56:59,013
wouldn't set eyes on Colin.

812
00:57:07,912 --> 00:57:10,258
intend to remain
abroad this time?

813
00:57:10,282 --> 00:57:12,627
MEDLOCK: All week, sir.
The travel might do

814
00:57:12,651 --> 00:57:14,662
his health some bit of
good if you ask me.

815
00:57:14,686 --> 00:57:17,031
DOCTOR: I did not ask you.

816
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:23,137
MEDLOCK: No sir.

817
00:57:23,161 --> 00:57:25,773
DOCTOR: You say the boy's health
is further deteriorated?

818
00:57:25,797 --> 00:57:28,009
MEDLOCK: I'm not
qualified to diagnose,

819
00:57:28,033 --> 00:57:30,210
but the night terrors
are more frequent.

820
00:57:30,234 --> 00:57:32,647
Perhaps, if he could
be made to walk...

821
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:34,047
- DOCTOR: I agree.
- MEDLOCK: Oh?

822
00:57:34,071 --> 00:57:36,917
DOCTOR: You are certainly not
qualified to diagnose.

823
00:57:36,941 --> 00:57:39,788
Any attempt to alter
his condition

824
00:57:39,812 --> 00:57:43,525
is likely to make it worse.

825
00:57:43,549 --> 00:57:46,262
I should like to see
that secret workshop.

826
00:57:46,286 --> 00:57:49,129
We'll have to find a way
to transport you there.

827
00:57:49,153 --> 00:57:52,567
You are supposed to find a boy
to help carry me there.

828
00:57:52,591 --> 00:57:56,303
I know a boy who
may help, but you

829
00:57:56,327 --> 00:57:59,707
haven't given me enough
time to ask him yet.

830
00:57:59,731 --> 00:58:05,914
Besides, I'm not sure that he
can carry you all that way.

831
00:58:05,938 --> 00:58:09,284
What is this?

832
00:58:09,308 --> 00:58:11,953
This is my cousin, Mary Lennox.

833
00:58:11,977 --> 00:58:13,289
Sir, I don't know
how it's happened.

834
00:58:13,313 --> 00:58:15,957
No one would dare tell.
The servants have their orders.

835
00:58:15,981 --> 00:58:18,158
Calm yourself, Medlock.

836
00:58:18,182 --> 00:58:22,054
She heard my cries and she
found me on her own.

837
00:58:32,664 --> 00:58:35,677
I'm afraid there's been
too much excitement.

838
00:58:35,701 --> 00:58:38,847
Excitement is not
good for you, my boy.

839
00:58:38,871 --> 00:58:45,853
She makes me better. I think
we shall have tea together.

840
00:58:45,877 --> 00:58:48,324
He does seem a bit better, sir.

841
00:58:48,348 --> 00:58:52,327
A mere trick of the mind. We
must not forget that he is ill.

842
00:58:52,351 --> 00:58:58,198
I want to forget.
She makes me forget.

843
00:58:58,222 --> 00:59:00,634
Mrs. Medlock, I expected better

844
00:59:00,658 --> 00:59:03,136
control of this
household from you.

845
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:08,142

will be forthcoming.

00:59:13,204 --> 00:59:17,609
You may bring us our tea now.

Dickon!

850
00:59:37,995 --> 00:59:39,307
Martha told me that
you had chores

851
00:59:39,331 --> 00:59:40,412
today and wouldn't make it.

852
00:59:41,198 --> 00:59:43,310
I stayed up all night and
finished them this morning.

853
00:59:43,334 --> 00:59:44,779
I couldn't stop thinking
about the garden.

854
00:59:44,803 --> 00:59:47,348
I couldn't sleep either.

855
00:59:47,372 --> 00:59:51,544
I've had the most
peculiar adventure.

01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:05,366
MARY: How did this happen?

857
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:08,736
DICKON: I lit an extra boiler.

858
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:09,760
Won't we get caught?

859
01:00:10,461 --> 01:00:14,677
I made sure the steam we need
only comes to this room.

860
01:00:14,701 --> 01:00:16,679
You're a genius.

861
01:00:16,703 --> 01:00:21,082
Ha. Tell that to
Ben Weatherstaff.

862
01:00:21,106 --> 01:00:26,354
So, tell me about
your adventure.

863
01:00:26,378 --> 01:00:30,324
I've made a strange discovery.

864
01:00:30,348 --> 01:00:32,695
Stranger than a secret
workshop covered

865
01:00:32,719 --> 01:00:34,361
in mechanical vines
and doll parts?

866
01:00:34,385 --> 01:00:39,466
Do you know about Colin?

867
01:00:39,490 --> 01:00:41,969
What do you know about him?

868
01:00:41,993 --> 01:00:43,937
I've seen him.

869
01:00:43,961 --> 01:00:46,441
He demanded that I
sit with him this morning.

870
01:00:46,465 --> 01:00:51,879
He says that I make him forget
about being ill and dying.

871
01:00:51,903 --> 01:00:58,953
And how do you manage that?

872
01:00:58,977 --> 01:01:05,225
Well, I told him
about this place.

873
01:01:05,249 --> 01:01:07,729
Will he keep the secret?

874
01:01:07,753 --> 01:01:10,832
I think so.

875
01:01:10,856 --> 01:01:13,134
He wants to visit,
but I told him that

876
01:01:13,158 --> 01:01:15,136
I couldn't see him
this afternoon

877
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:19,874
so that I could discuss it
with you first.

878
01:01:19,898 --> 01:01:23,477
I think a visit to a place like
this might do him some good,

879
01:01:23,501 --> 01:01:25,178
but he's not able
to walk, is he?

880
01:01:25,202 --> 01:01:29,149
No.

881
01:01:29,173 --> 01:01:31,852
I wondered if we
might convince Ben

882
01:01:31,876 --> 01:01:33,921
Weatherstaff to carry him here.

883
01:01:33,945 --> 01:01:35,422
And spoil the secret?

884
01:01:35,446 --> 01:01:39,993
I suppose it would.

885
01:01:40,017 --> 01:01:43,430
Is your uncle still away?

886
01:01:43,454 --> 01:01:46,034
For another day or two.

887
01:01:46,058 --> 01:01:48,770
Meet me in my hideout tonight.

888
01:01:48,794 --> 01:01:51,405
I think I have a
more suitable idea

889
01:01:51,429 --> 01:01:58,479
for Master Colin's
transportation.

890
01:01:58,503 --> 01:02:00,848
I'll not pretend
to know what the

891
01:02:00,872 --> 01:02:03,017
pair of you is up
to with that key,

892
01:02:03,041 --> 01:02:07,054
but our Dickon's not seemed
happier his whole life.

893
01:02:07,078 --> 01:02:14,162
Yes, I... I suppose he does
seem happy. Doesn't he?

894
01:02:14,186 --> 01:02:16,797
(DISTANT WAILING)

895
01:02:16,821 --> 01:02:19,200
How dreadful that sounds.
He ought to be stopped.

896
01:02:19,224 --> 01:02:21,068
It's his illness, Miss Mary.
He can't be held

897
01:02:21,092 --> 01:02:23,370
accountable for something
he can't control.

898
01:02:23,394 --> 01:02:25,072
Somebody ought to make him stop.
He

899
01:02:25,096 --> 01:02:26,506
works himself up into hysterics.

900
01:02:26,530 --> 01:02:29,042
Miss Mary! He'll do himself
harm. You must come quick.

901
01:02:29,066 --> 01:02:31,578
No one can do anything for him
and he likes you.

902
01:02:31,602 --> 01:02:35,049
I'm dressed for bed! Tell him
to gain control of himself!

903
01:02:35,073 --> 01:02:36,917
That's the right humor.
You go and scold him.

904
01:02:36,941 --> 01:02:38,486
Give him something
new to think of.

905
01:02:38,510 --> 01:02:43,016
As quick as you can!

906
01:02:47,318 --> 01:02:53,301
(CRYING)

907
01:02:53,325 --> 01:02:57,971
You stop!

908
01:02:57,995 --> 01:03:02,109
I hate your wailing.
Everybody hates it.

909
01:03:02,133 --> 01:03:04,946
I wish that everyone
would run out of the

910
01:03:04,970 --> 01:03:07,848
factory and let you cry
yourself to death.

911
01:03:07,872 --> 01:03:10,884
If you scream another scream,
I'll scream too.

912
01:03:10,908 --> 01:03:12,919
And I can scream
louder than you.

913
01:03:12,943 --> 01:03:13,943
I can't stop!

914
01:03:14,611 --> 01:03:17,258
Yes you can! Half that
ails you is hysterics!

915
01:03:17,282 --> 01:03:20,294
COLIN: I felt it!
I felt the lump!

916
01:03:20,318 --> 01:03:21,318
MEDLOCK: Keep up!

917
01:03:22,053 --> 01:03:23,230
COLIN: I shall have
a hunch on my back

918
01:03:23,254 --> 01:03:24,464
just like my father
and then I shall die

919
01:03:24,488 --> 01:03:29,502
never having walked a step in
all of my life!

920
01:03:29,526 --> 01:03:34,008
You didn't feel any lump.

921
01:03:34,032 --> 01:03:36,141
There's nothing the
matter with your

922
01:03:36,165 --> 01:03:38,111
horrid back. Nothing
but hysterics.

923
01:03:38,135 --> 01:03:42,350
Sit up and let me feel it.

924
01:03:42,374 --> 01:03:44,951
Mrs. Medlock, come
and sit Colin up.

925
01:03:44,975 --> 01:03:49,213
Show her. She'll see then!

926
01:04:04,195 --> 01:04:07,274
There isn't a single lump there.

927
01:04:07,298 --> 01:04:14,314
If you say that there is again,
I shall laugh.

928
01:04:14,338 --> 01:04:19,687
Do you suppose I could
live to grow up?

929
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:21,454
Of course you will.

930
01:04:21,478 --> 01:04:24,491
If you can control your temper

931
01:04:24,515 --> 01:04:28,930
and breathe in something other
than the stale air of this room.

932
01:04:28,954 --> 01:04:32,366
I shouldn't hate fresh air
if we could find...

933
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:35,136
if Dickon could come and
help me move about.

934
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:37,270
Doctor Craven would never
allow such a thing.

935
01:04:37,294 --> 01:04:39,472
Mistress Mary, you must come
get your sleep out.

936
01:04:39,496 --> 01:04:41,241
He'll nod off after a while.

937
01:04:41,265 --> 01:04:45,946
I will put him to sleep.
You may go, if you like.

938
01:04:45,970 --> 01:04:48,683
Miss Mary, what was there?
What did you see?

939
01:04:48,707 --> 01:04:51,953
I think that I shall sing him a
song that I learned from my Aya,

940
01:04:51,977 --> 01:04:57,725
then I'll return to bed.

941
01:04:57,749 --> 01:05:01,462
Good night.

942
01:05:01,486 --> 01:05:03,128
MARTHA: Is Master Colin
really going to live?

943
01:05:03,152 --> 01:05:04,665
What was it Miss Mary saw?

944
01:05:04,689 --> 01:05:06,968
It is none of our
concern, Martha, and

945
01:05:06,992 --> 01:05:08,703
if Miss Mary has
any decency in her

946
01:05:08,727 --> 01:05:11,038
she'll never mention it.

947
01:05:11,062 --> 01:05:13,607
But she certainly saw something.

948
01:05:13,631 --> 01:05:21,114
And neither will you.

949
01:05:21,138 --> 01:05:25,386
I almost told, but I stopped
myself in time.

950
01:05:25,410 --> 01:05:28,153
Have you learned
anything else about

951
01:05:28,177 --> 01:05:30,491
the way into the secret garden?

952
01:05:30,515 --> 01:05:33,694
Yes. I have.

953
01:05:33,718 --> 01:05:40,532
And if you will go to sleep,
I will show you tomorrow.

954
01:05:40,556 --> 01:05:45,506
I think if I could get into it,
I should live to grow up.

955
01:05:45,530 --> 01:05:47,508
Why is that?

956
01:05:47,532 --> 01:05:50,343
It's just a feeling.

957
01:05:50,367 --> 01:05:54,314
Do you suppose that instead
of singing me your Aya song,

958
01:05:54,338 --> 01:06:00,654
you could just tell me what you
think it looks like?

959
01:06:00,678 --> 01:06:07,060
Yes.

960
01:06:07,084 --> 01:06:12,232
Close your eyes.

961
01:06:12,256 --> 01:06:17,570
It has been left
alone for so long

962
01:06:17,594 --> 01:06:23,276
that it's covered in
a strange gray mist.

963
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:30,718
Some of it is dead.
Some of it is still very alive.

964
01:06:30,742 --> 01:06:35,013
And a R.O.B.I.N.
watches over it all.

965
01:06:50,361 --> 01:06:52,305
You're late.

966
01:06:52,329 --> 01:06:55,843
I had to convince Colin that
he isn't a hunchback.

967
01:06:55,867 --> 01:06:59,212
I think it's time we get to
the bottom of Colin's illness.

968
01:06:59,236 --> 01:07:01,414
Have you ever been to
your uncle's study?

969
01:07:01,438 --> 01:07:03,116
Once.

970
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:06,251
And did he have a
mechanical chair?

971
01:07:06,275 --> 01:07:12,225
Yes. A very odd sort of chair.

972
01:07:12,249 --> 01:07:16,588
A chair on wheels?

973
01:07:26,395 --> 01:07:29,541
Let's get the chair to Colin's

974
01:07:29,565 --> 01:07:33,604
room before someone
finds us here.

975
01:07:57,694 --> 01:08:00,206
DICKON: We'll come back in the
morning for him.

976
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:03,143
Won't Mrs. Medlock find
out that he's gone?

977
01:08:03,167 --> 01:08:06,379
Martha can handle Mrs. Medlock.

978
01:08:06,403 --> 01:08:08,281
Meet me here just after sunrise.

979
01:08:08,305 --> 01:08:13,143
I'll be here. I don't think I'll
be able to sleep until then.

980
01:08:13,745 --> 01:08:17,191
Here. I made some notes.

981
01:08:17,215 --> 01:08:21,428
Look them over tonight.
I think you'll

982
01:08:21,452 --> 01:08:25,390
be able to repair the
doll on your own.

983

01:09:18,610 --> 01:09:19,853
I know. I'm sorry.

990
01:09:19,877 --> 01:09:24,249
Shh! There goes Mrs. Medlock.

991
01:09:38,795 --> 01:09:40,907
Have you already seen to
Miss Mary this morning?

992
01:09:40,931 --> 01:09:45,678
I have, so I've come to look
after Master Colin as well.

993
01:09:45,702 --> 01:09:49,250
That will be quite helpful.

994
01:09:49,274 --> 01:09:51,818
I've a great deal
of preparation to

995
01:09:51,842 --> 01:09:56,147
see to before Lord
Craven's return.

996
01:10:03,754 --> 01:10:05,566
The corridor is clear.
Mrs. Medlock won't

997
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:08,968
be back this way
until lunch time.

998
01:10:08,992 --> 01:10:13,565
Thank you, Martha.

999
01:10:23,708 --> 01:10:27,388
You can hardly tell
he's breathing.

1000
01:10:27,412 --> 01:10:33,294
Doesn't anyone know
what's wrong with him?

1001
01:10:33,318 --> 01:10:36,361
How can a boy remain ill
for such a long time.

1002
01:10:36,385 --> 01:10:39,666
I don't know.

1003
01:10:39,690 --> 01:10:40,690
Who are you?

1004
01:10:41,726 --> 01:10:45,462
Colin. This is Dickon.
We've brought you a surprise.

1005
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,745
What is it?

1006
01:10:53,769 --> 01:10:56,915
That's your
transportation to the

1007
01:10:56,939 --> 01:11:02,723
secret place I told you about.

1008
01:11:02,747 --> 01:11:07,284
Help me into it at once.

1009
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:31,483
Now cover your eyes.

1010
01:11:31,507 --> 01:11:35,846
Alright. Open them.

1011
01:11:48,659 --> 01:11:52,138
This place seems so familiar.

1012
01:11:52,162 --> 01:11:56,434
And yet I've never
seen it before.

1013
01:12:13,717 --> 01:12:17,996
If only I were cured. I would
explore every single corner.

1014
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:20,401
This place will cure you.

1015
01:12:20,425 --> 01:12:22,502
I'm going to walk?

MARTHA: I can't stall
Mrs. Medlock any longer.

1017
01:12:23,895 --> 01:12:27,005
She'll be in Master Colin's
room soon with lunch.

1018
01:12:27,029 --> 01:12:32,078
This place is full of life.
Can't you feel it?

1019
01:12:32,102 --> 01:12:36,683
The air is certainly different.
It is no longer stale.

1020
01:12:36,707 --> 01:12:40,577
Breathe it in. It'll make
your legs grow strong.

1021
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:48,693
Doctor Craven says I
shall not grow anymore.

1022
01:12:48,717 --> 01:12:50,129
He says I shall
have a hunch on my

1023
01:12:50,153 --> 01:12:51,799
back and be barely able to move,

1024
01:12:51,823 --> 01:12:53,434
just like my father.

1025
01:12:53,458 --> 01:12:54,933
MARTHA: Perhaps none
of you heard me.

1026
01:12:54,957 --> 01:12:58,104
She's right. We should get Colin
back to his room for the day.

1027
01:12:58,128 --> 01:13:01,832
We'll bring you back here again
soon. And we'll make you walk.

1028
01:13:05,868 --> 01:13:10,474
We promise.

That's the R.O.B.I.N.
I was telling you about.

I finally silenced the last
of these little beasts.

1038
01:14:01,291 --> 01:14:04,903
Your place is out on the moor.
You've no right to be here.

1039
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:06,638
Dickon is my guest!

1040
01:14:06,662 --> 01:14:08,907
This boy is no concern of yours.
You

1041
01:14:08,931 --> 01:14:11,511
will do well to
stay away from him.

1042
01:14:11,535 --> 01:14:14,280
Mary is family and she may
do as she pleases.

1043
01:14:14,304 --> 01:14:17,916
Along with her guest.

1044
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:20,952
They're going to
teach me to walk.

1045
01:14:20,976 --> 01:14:24,791
She's bewitched you.
Nothing more.

1046
01:14:24,815 --> 01:14:28,895
Filled your head with dreams of
walking about and exploring.

1047
01:14:28,919 --> 01:14:33,000
Nonsense. I cured him of
his fits just last night.

1048
01:14:33,024 --> 01:14:35,968
Leave the medicine to me.

1049
01:14:35,992 --> 01:14:37,937
The boy was already
quite ill and

1050
01:14:37,961 --> 01:14:40,541
I'm afraid you've made
matters infinitely worse.

1051
01:14:40,565 --> 01:14:41,973
Escort these two away from here!

1052
01:14:41,997 --> 01:14:43,576
I will see to
Master Colin myself.

1053
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:48,039
Immediately!

1054
01:14:57,980 --> 01:15:04,964
How did you fix her?

1055
01:15:04,988 --> 01:15:07,767
We found the missing pieces
in the secret garden

1056
01:15:07,791 --> 01:15:10,969
then Dickon loaned me
the tools I needed.

1059
01:15:16,967 --> 01:15:19,010
I just need to bring him
back to my hideout.

1060
01:15:19,034 --> 01:15:20,947
What about poor Colin?

1061
01:15:20,971 --> 01:15:23,616
I thought the trip to the garden
would do him some good.

1062
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:27,152
Maybe it has.

Don't blame yourself.
Even Doctor

1066
01:15:36,087 --> 01:15:41,000
Craven hasn't been
able to cure him.

1067
01:15:41,024 --> 01:15:43,069
Should I go and
help to quiet him?

1068
01:15:43,093 --> 01:15:47,205
It will probably make the
doctor even angrier.

1069
01:15:47,229 --> 01:15:51,744
I'll take my chances.

You!

1075
01:16:14,189 --> 01:16:15,268
He worked himself into hysterics

1076
01:16:15,292 --> 01:16:16,434
claiming you promised
him a garden

1077
01:16:16,458 --> 01:16:18,005
that would heal him
and make him walk.

1078

I made no such promise!

1079
01:16:19,462 --> 01:16:22,074
His fragile health couldn't
handle the emotional pain.

1080
01:16:22,098 --> 01:16:29,749
You've killed the boy!

1081
01:16:29,773 --> 01:16:32,919
Of this I am certain.
You are to blame.

1082
01:16:32,943 --> 01:16:37,322
No one is to enter
the boy's room.

1083

and deal with all of you.

01:17:14,718 --> 01:17:17,186
It shall.

1092
01:17:23,059 --> 01:17:25,662

You know that I
didn't kill Colin.

1095
01:17:41,877 --> 01:17:44,022
Stay until your uncle arrives.
He won't blame you.

1096
01:17:44,046 --> 01:17:45,857
Colin's been ill
his entire life.

1097
01:17:45,881 --> 01:17:48,861
Doctor Craven blames me.

1098
01:17:48,885 --> 01:17:52,999
He'll convince everyone
that it's my fault.

Dickon. Something
terrible's happened.

1114

Young Master Colin...
He died.

1115
01:21:42,318 --> 01:21:45,263
Doctor Craven's blaming
Mistress Mary.

1116
01:21:45,287 --> 01:21:47,098
But they're sure
to drag you into

you mark my words.

1118
01:21:48,622 --> 01:21:51,303
You need to leave the factory
right now for your own sake.

1119
01:21:51,327 --> 01:21:53,104
I have to find Mary.

1120
01:21:53,128 --> 01:21:56,240
What?

1121
01:21:56,264 --> 01:21:59,611
Did you not hear me, boy?
The worst has happened.

1122

It'll ruin us all!

1123
01:22:01,671 --> 01:22:04,650
Doctor Craven is a liar.
Check the R.O.B.I.N.'s memory.

1129
01:22:29,665 --> 01:22:31,576
Mechanical!

1130
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:35,046
Look! I should have known it
when he showed me his back.

1131
01:22:35,070 --> 01:22:38,317
I saw my Aunt Lily's flower
on the back of his neck.

1132
01:22:38,341 --> 01:22:41,120
Lily Craven created her own
mechanical son. Of course!

1133
01:22:41,144 --> 01:22:43,388
So he can't have died!

1134
01:22:43,412 --> 01:22:46,090
But why would Doctor
Craven lie to us?

1135

The R.O.B.I.N. showed
me everything.

1136
01:22:47,783 --> 01:22:49,527
Doctor Craven is
behind all of it.

Colin's illness...

1138
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,365
All of it?

With no one to stand between
himself and Lord Craven,

1140
01:22:55,358 --> 01:22:57,503
he would inherit all of
Craven Industries.

1141
01:22:57,527 --> 01:23:00,570
No! But my uncle is alive.
And well!

1142
01:23:00,594 --> 01:23:03,375
I suspect that's only
because he wanted

1143
01:23:03,399 --> 01:23:05,777
to take care of
everyone else first.

1144
01:23:05,801 --> 01:23:08,613
He never was pleased
to have me here.

1145
01:23:08,637 --> 01:23:11,482
If Colin is a mechanical boy,
maybe we can fix him.

1146
01:23:11,506 --> 01:23:14,317
But I've just come from his
room. Dickon, he isn't there!

1147
01:23:14,341 --> 01:23:18,246
Doctor Craven must have
hidden him somewhere.

1148

DICKON: Doctor Craven sealed
it up all over again.

1149
01:23:27,489 --> 01:23:32,027
Colin must be in there.

You said that this opens every
lock in this factory?

1151
01:23:42,671 --> 01:23:47,209
Let's hope you're right.

1152
01:24:00,523 --> 01:24:02,365
Dickon, what do we do?

1153
01:24:02,389 --> 01:24:04,634
He's the most complex machine
I've ever seen.

1154
01:24:04,658 --> 01:24:07,805
We have to fix him!

1155
01:24:07,829 --> 01:24:12,244
Looks like he was
never completed.

1156
01:24:12,268 --> 01:24:16,339
I don't think we can
bring him back.

1157
01:24:25,881 --> 01:24:29,392
No. There must be a way.

Colin's mother just
to bring him to life

1160
01:24:34,623 --> 01:24:38,461
she must have left behind
a way to complete him.

1161
01:24:48,870 --> 01:24:54,719
If you're right, then Doctor
Craven will be after me as well.

01:24:57,344 --> 01:25:01,650
I will.

1164
