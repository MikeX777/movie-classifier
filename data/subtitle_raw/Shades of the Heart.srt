1
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:51,180
In my dream last night
I was old,

2
00:00:52,454 --> 00:00:55,008
and I was walking somewhere
with an old woman.

3
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,120
I saw the two of us from behind.

4
00:01:01,941 --> 00:01:03,079
Strangely

5
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:05,674
I could see myself from behind.

6
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,721
We were walking somewhere.

7
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:13,221
We slid along like snails.

8
00:01:15,696 --> 00:01:19,261
Then the old woman
and I just vanished.

9
00:01:21,937 --> 00:01:24,952
At a very slow speed.

10
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:33,465
MI YOUNG

11
00:02:04,387 --> 00:02:05,485
Who...?

12
00:02:12,036 --> 00:02:13,040
Who are you?

13
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,493
Hello.

14
00:02:20,606 --> 00:02:24,516
I'm waiting for someone here.

15
00:02:28,702 --> 00:02:29,910
Waiting for who?

16
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:35,352
You're pretty when you sleep.

17
00:02:37,702 --> 00:02:38,702
Me?

18
00:02:54,936 --> 00:02:56,085
Aren't you leaving?

19
00:02:59,031 --> 00:03:00,488
I'm waiting for someone, too.

20
00:03:03,023 --> 00:03:04,962
There are plenty of other tables.

21
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:10,861
The person I'm meeting is here.

22
00:03:12,814 --> 00:03:16,882
I'm the one who's
meeting you here, Mi-young.

23
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:21,494
Ahâ€¦!

24
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:34,085
How embarrassing.

25
00:03:35,713 --> 00:03:36,743
Oh my god.

26
00:03:40,526 --> 00:03:41,850
It's nice to meet you.

27
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:44,788
You too.

28
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,588
I'm sorry.

29
00:04:15,264 --> 00:04:18,034
Why are those people so busy?

30
00:04:28,492 --> 00:04:29,542
You're right.

31
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:34,509
It seems like time has sped up.

32
00:04:42,738 --> 00:04:44,689
Aren't you scared of getting old?

33
00:05:03,557 --> 00:05:05,452
You don't look like Won.

34
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,103
Even though she's your sister.

35
00:05:14,285 --> 00:05:19,047
Not my sister, she's a cousin.

36
00:05:22,812 --> 00:05:25,617
That makes sense.

37
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,864
She doesn't like me enough to
set me up with her brother.

38
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:34,374
She said you're
an oddball like me.

39
00:05:35,664 --> 00:05:37,073
You look normal.

40
00:05:38,822 --> 00:05:40,401
I heard you studied in America?

41
00:05:42,233 --> 00:05:44,484
Yes, I did. Sure.

42
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,909
From your attitude,
I see it didn't change you.

43
00:05:59,649 --> 00:06:01,063
What book were you reading?

44
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:06,695
Nothing special, just a novel.

45
00:06:08,728 --> 00:06:09,999
You're right about that.

46
00:06:11,261 --> 00:06:14,662
I can't figure out
people who read novels.

47
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,290
It's all made up,
so why believe it?

48
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,350
You think so?

49
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:29,341
Still, well-made stories
can make people believe.

50
00:06:30,165 --> 00:06:31,830
When you know it's fake?

51
00:06:42,174 --> 00:06:44,426
There's a story I made up.

52
00:06:47,422 --> 00:06:48,422
Want to hear it?

53
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:53,555
Tell me, then.

54
00:06:58,469 --> 00:06:59,778
It just came to me now.

55
00:07:02,996 --> 00:07:05,120
Near the school
where I studied abroad,

56
00:07:06,452 --> 00:07:10,720
there was a 5-star hotel,
really big and fancy.

57
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,044
Once I went in there
with my professor.

58
00:07:20,075 --> 00:07:21,350
I can't forget the smell there.

59
00:07:22,704 --> 00:07:26,122
It was filled with
the smell of lilies.

60
00:07:27,216 --> 00:07:28,216
So,

61
00:07:31,043 --> 00:07:33,579
a nice hotel has
a nice smell, I thought...

62
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:45,556
And that old hotel
had an ancient bellboy.

63
00:07:46,684 --> 00:07:50,561
He was an old man,
had worked there for decades.

64
00:07:51,834 --> 00:07:52,955
Then one day,

65
00:07:55,022 --> 00:07:58,453
a tramp came in
like it was his own house.

66
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,606
He was an old man, too.

67
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:05,320
The tramp...

68
00:08:08,161 --> 00:08:14,263
insisted on staying in the hotel suite,
and wouldn't budge.

69
00:08:16,749 --> 00:08:17,874
A madman.

70
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,220
Well, he was odd.

71
00:08:23,811 --> 00:08:25,015
But the thing is,

72
00:08:26,285 --> 00:08:29,302
years ago that tramp used to
frequent that hotel like home.

73
00:08:30,546 --> 00:08:34,913
He'd been rich enough to use
the suite like his own house.

74
00:08:36,397 --> 00:08:37,818
But for whatever reason,

75
00:08:38,868 --> 00:08:45,250
decades later he turns up
with no money, slightly mad.

76
00:08:46,305 --> 00:08:49,913
In those decades, the only one
who hadn't changed was the bellboy,

77
00:08:49,914 --> 00:08:52,554
so only he remembered that man.

78
00:08:56,192 --> 00:08:57,619
So the bellboy,

79
00:08:59,989 --> 00:09:01,756
very graciously,

80
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:07,165
treated him with all the respect
of an old customer.

81
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,883
When the man began spouting
nonsense about going to his room,

82
00:09:13,949 --> 00:09:18,275
the bellboy politely
removed his hat,

83
00:09:19,975 --> 00:09:22,783
took hold of the man's
dirty, heavy bags,

84
00:09:23,768 --> 00:09:25,425
opened the door for him,

85
00:09:26,612 --> 00:09:32,244
and went with him to the highest
floor where the suite room is.

86
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:35,852
So what happened?

87
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:49,230
The man stood in the hallway
thinking for a moment,

88
00:09:54,317 --> 00:09:58,453
then went down with the bellboy
back to the lobby.

89
00:10:00,107 --> 00:10:04,604
And after fishing around
in his dirty bag,

90
00:10:05,384 --> 00:10:06,554
from inside,

91
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,265
he pulled out some coins.

92
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,423
Two 100-won coins.

93
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,650
It's in America,
how'd he get 100-won coins?

94
00:10:24,493 --> 00:10:26,354
Because I just
made the story up.

95
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,005
What an oddball.

96
00:10:40,721 --> 00:10:42,653
That was boring.

97
00:10:45,774 --> 00:10:48,585
Sure enough, it was lousy.

98
00:10:51,887 --> 00:10:53,745
That boring story of yours...

99
00:11:00,273 --> 00:11:00,703
made me sleepy.

100
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:01,703
Made me sleepy.

101
00:11:23,612 --> 00:11:24,817
But you know,

102
00:11:27,408 --> 00:11:28,918
you look like my boyfriend.

103
00:11:30,619 --> 00:11:31,649
Really?

104
00:11:33,516 --> 00:11:34,516
Yeah.

105
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:41,432
I used to meet him
in this place.

106
00:11:45,966 --> 00:11:48,059
The shape of your nose
is just like his.

107
00:11:52,151 --> 00:11:53,151
Really?

108
00:11:54,175 --> 00:11:55,175
Yes.

109
00:11:58,292 --> 00:11:59,961
My friend Won

110
00:12:03,043 --> 00:12:08,613
set me up with her cousin here.

111
00:12:11,683 --> 00:12:13,227
I met him,

112
00:12:17,568 --> 00:12:19,562
and we married two months later.

113
00:12:23,798 --> 00:12:24,823
I see.

114
00:12:28,906 --> 00:12:30,339
He was a good person.

115
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:34,450
He died.

116
00:12:36,981 --> 00:12:38,726
Smoked too many cigarettes.

117
00:12:55,823 --> 00:12:56,964
Chang-seok?

118
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,346
Yeah?

119
00:13:06,011 --> 00:13:08,312
So now you recognize me.

120
00:13:11,068 --> 00:13:12,814
Don't smoke.

121
00:13:16,017 --> 00:13:17,789
Or you'll die young
like your father.

122
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:38,669
We both need to
watch our health, Mom.

123
00:13:45,145 --> 00:13:47,724
You're good with words,
like your dad.

124
00:13:53,524 --> 00:14:00,811
Nothing you can do
about getting old.

125
00:14:03,361 --> 00:14:07,573
You die, or break down.

126
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:25,203
You've sat there a while.
Let's go.

127
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:40,539
Not much has changed here.

128
00:14:45,866 --> 00:14:47,122
That's a relief.

129
00:15:41,177 --> 00:15:42,677
I had a dream.

130
00:15:46,539 --> 00:15:52,980
I dreamed I met your dad.

131
00:16:50,671 --> 00:16:58,671
SHADES OF THE HEART

132
00:17:07,757 --> 00:17:13,528
When I lived in Seoul before, I
thought it was an uncontrollably fast city.

133
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:17,243
I was scared
everything would change,

134
00:17:18,198 --> 00:17:23,989
but now that time 7 years ago
feels like yesterday.

135
00:17:26,075 --> 00:17:30,469
It passed in an instant,
but in that time everyone aged.

136
00:17:33,384 --> 00:17:36,128
After returning to Korea, I'm trying
to spend a lot of time with Mom.

137
00:17:37,033 --> 00:17:39,219
We took short walks every day.

138
00:17:41,162 --> 00:17:44,352
Tomorrow Mom enters
a nursing home in Cheonan.

139
00:17:45,328 --> 00:17:47,557
I probably won't see her
for a while.

140
00:17:50,077 --> 00:17:54,165
Today I left her with my brother,
and took a walk by myself.

141
00:17:55,763 --> 00:17:58,400
It's the path
I used to walk with you.

142
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,731
It was so nice in the spring.

143
00:18:03,026 --> 00:18:06,312
Now it looks different.

144
00:18:12,455 --> 00:18:18,393
YOO JIN

145
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:34,679
Chang-seok.

146
00:18:38,441 --> 00:18:39,539
Yoo-jin.

147
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,540
Long time no see.

148
00:18:42,352 --> 00:18:43,513
I've aged, right?

149
00:18:45,985 --> 00:18:48,801
You look exactly the same.
What are you talking about?

150
00:18:50,027 --> 00:18:54,063
As always, you're too nice.
Let's have coffee.

151
00:18:56,289 --> 00:18:59,817
Well, I arrived early,
so I drank a cup already.

152
00:19:00,174 --> 00:19:01,994
It's nice here,
so I was walking around.

153
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:04,475
You already had coffee?

154
00:19:06,147 --> 00:19:09,885
I went to bed late,
so I needed one to wake up.

155
00:19:12,577 --> 00:19:14,668
But I'll have another,
let's go in.

156
00:19:14,669 --> 00:19:16,600
Yes, I'd like that.

157
00:19:17,184 --> 00:19:19,605
I brought the company card,
so let's spend it.

158
00:19:21,212 --> 00:19:22,317
Do they have beer here?

159
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,150
Beer?

160
00:19:36,687 --> 00:19:38,606
Tastes good during the day.

161
00:19:42,185 --> 00:19:43,198
You're right.

162
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:50,301
- I brought the contract.
- Okay.

163
00:19:50,302 --> 00:19:53,305
Luckily all our
editorial team liked it.

164
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:56,697
And the CEO followed
our opinions.

165
00:20:00,111 --> 00:20:01,490
He didn't read it?

166
00:20:02,479 --> 00:20:03,616
I don't know.

167
00:20:04,134 --> 00:20:06,867
Our boss rarely reads
books by other people.

168
00:20:07,338 --> 00:20:09,690
Especially books that
everyone likes.

169
00:20:10,687 --> 00:20:12,283
Novelists are different, I guess.

170
00:20:13,471 --> 00:20:15,282
Here is your contract.

171
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:23,962
Had you ever read
our CEO's novels?

172
00:20:26,485 --> 00:20:27,878
Well, I...

173
00:20:30,112 --> 00:20:31,442
I started a few.

174
00:20:33,931 --> 00:20:35,267
They're hardly worth it.

175
00:20:36,426 --> 00:20:40,684
He's a famous novelist
who's never written a decent book.

176
00:20:41,675 --> 00:20:45,099
He got his reputation
from doing other things.

177
00:20:47,062 --> 00:20:51,313
But he's published good books,
we should give him credit.

178
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:53,593
You're pretty harsh.

179
00:20:54,762 --> 00:20:56,035
Do you say that to his face?

180
00:20:56,746 --> 00:20:59,983
Well, it's not that I couldn't.

181
00:21:01,503 --> 00:21:04,401
I don't think he hired me
because he likes me.

182
00:21:06,091 --> 00:21:08,078
If things get bad,
I'll just leave.

183
00:21:10,187 --> 00:21:11,293
You're so cold.

184
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,998
Do you want my cold opinion
of your book?

185
00:21:26,638 --> 00:21:28,633
Walking makes me
feel more drunk.

186
00:21:29,568 --> 00:21:30,568
What should I do?

187
00:21:34,446 --> 00:21:35,983
What will you write next?

188
00:21:39,701 --> 00:21:42,914
I don't know if I'll
write anymore.

189
00:21:43,947 --> 00:21:45,519
I wrote this one,

190
00:21:46,912 --> 00:21:48,884
but I'm not sure
I have anything more.

191
00:21:51,072 --> 00:21:54,085
I never once thought
of myself as a novelist.

192
00:21:59,342 --> 00:22:01,405
A lot of people liked your novel.

193
00:22:03,183 --> 00:22:04,183
Who?

194
00:22:10,116 --> 00:22:12,790
Father, father...

195
00:22:15,826 --> 00:22:19,283
Learning editing under you
was really helpful for me.

196
00:22:20,147 --> 00:22:21,147
From me?

197
00:22:22,794 --> 00:22:25,473
If you took a lot from me,
that's not good.

198
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:28,580
You must have fought a lot.

199
00:22:29,197 --> 00:22:31,300
How did you know?

200
00:22:34,183 --> 00:22:37,369
I don't think of
your new novel as fiction.

201
00:22:38,109 --> 00:22:41,619
Just that I learned something
new about your life.

202
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,488
Since it's obviously your story.

203
00:22:46,363 --> 00:22:50,580
You could say that
nothing was made up.

204
00:22:51,511 --> 00:22:54,071
It's just as
I experienced it, but...

205
00:22:56,056 --> 00:22:57,662
it has a point of view.

206
00:22:57,929 --> 00:22:59,307
So that makes it a novel.

207
00:23:00,619 --> 00:23:04,496
If there's a point of view,
it's the same as making it up.

208
00:23:06,209 --> 00:23:09,978
You're still living.
The man in the novel dies.

209
00:23:10,881 --> 00:23:12,565
I understand it as a story.

210
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,906
Made-up stories are
often more honest.

211
00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:24,028
I'm glad that you enjoyed it.

212
00:23:25,454 --> 00:23:27,472
I never said I enjoyed it.

213
00:23:31,226 --> 00:23:32,255
But don't worry.

214
00:23:32,256 --> 00:23:34,474
I like your novel, too.

215
00:23:59,645 --> 00:24:04,376
Was it bitten by a dog or cat?

216
00:24:07,816 --> 00:24:08,929
What should we do?

217
00:24:14,281 --> 00:24:16,005
I don't think it will live.

218
00:24:19,104 --> 00:24:20,104
Is it dead?

219
00:24:26,485 --> 00:24:27,669
Not sure yet.

220
00:24:28,447 --> 00:24:30,797
Let's walk.
Sorry for making you see that.

221
00:24:38,257 --> 00:24:39,711
I see hope!

222
00:24:41,258 --> 00:24:42,499
Let's change direction.

223
00:24:42,854 --> 00:24:45,325
Here. Here, here.

224
00:24:48,889 --> 00:24:50,181
Hurry up.

225
00:24:50,819 --> 00:24:53,291
We should follow the wind.

226
00:24:58,791 --> 00:24:59,904
Let's hold hands.

227
00:25:00,902 --> 00:25:02,801
That way you won't get lost.

228
00:25:33,047 --> 00:25:37,044
Father... father...

229
00:26:15,906 --> 00:26:17,103
Is smoking allowed here?

230
00:26:18,389 --> 00:26:19,389
I don't know.

231
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:21,877
Do you smoke, too?

232
00:26:24,412 --> 00:26:25,412
I quit.

233
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:30,297
Take your time, it's fine.

234
00:26:35,317 --> 00:26:40,064
There are no streetlamps here.
We should go down.

235
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,671
- It makes a noise.
- Yeah.

236
00:26:48,672 --> 00:26:51,229
Wow, they have
cigarettes like that?

237
00:26:51,865 --> 00:26:53,365
Indonesian cigarettes.

238
00:26:58,968 --> 00:27:02,747
It smells nice,
like burning leaves.

239
00:27:03,869 --> 00:27:06,524
Yes, my boyfriend smoked them.

240
00:27:08,296 --> 00:27:10,438
I dated an Indonesian man.

241
00:27:20,803 --> 00:27:22,546
I can't help but try one.

242
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:03,151
A while back, I got pregnant.

243
00:28:05,807 --> 00:28:07,508
I didn't feel confident
enough to have it.

244
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:13,576
My boyfriend was
an exchange student.

245
00:28:16,139 --> 00:28:17,855
He understood about the abortion.

246
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,585
He went back
when it was getting cold.

247
00:28:23,147 --> 00:28:24,947
He had trouble with winter,
it's for the best.

248
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:34,930
If he was a student,
he was younger than you?

249
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:43,727
His eyes were beautiful.

250
00:28:46,629 --> 00:28:48,429
With his eyes all wet,
he looked more wistful.

251
00:28:56,819 --> 00:29:00,411
- When he left?
- Yes.

252
00:29:07,341 --> 00:29:09,607
And when I told him
about the abortion,

253
00:29:12,916 --> 00:29:14,120
he cried a long time,

254
00:29:15,017 --> 00:29:17,928
then he said he
named the baby "Rintik."

255
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:22,875
It means the sound a raindrop
makes falling off a leaf.

256
00:29:25,882 --> 00:29:27,844
He named our child that.

257
00:29:39,785 --> 00:29:41,030
Crazy fool.

258
00:29:45,395 --> 00:29:48,162
Naming a baby that
won't even be born,

259
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,412
does he even know
what that means?

260
00:30:14,863 --> 00:30:19,205
On my way back to Korea,
I read a magazine on the plane.

261
00:30:20,512 --> 00:30:23,088
An interview with someone
who walked on the moon twice.

262
00:30:27,898 --> 00:30:29,754
When he picked a title
for the book he wrote,

263
00:30:31,983 --> 00:30:36,467
it wasn't "Voyage to the Moon,"
it was "Return to Earth."

264
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:41,135
He said returning from the moon
is much harder than getting there.

265
00:30:48,365 --> 00:30:51,930
I'm not sure
what you're getting at.

266
00:30:57,388 --> 00:31:00,506
These are great.
They don't smell like cigarettes.

267
00:31:05,755 --> 00:31:07,491
This is my last pack.

268
00:31:08,948 --> 00:31:09,965
You must feel sad.

269
00:31:13,173 --> 00:31:14,173
It's all right.

270
00:31:54,451 --> 00:31:58,749
We agreed to publish the book,
and now I'm looking for work.

271
00:32:00,741 --> 00:32:05,002
But I don't think I can keep
my promise to quit smoking.

272
00:32:43,258 --> 00:32:45,686
- How about resort in Southern Asia?
- Sounds good.

273
00:32:46,169 --> 00:32:48,993
- Why don't you guys go together?
- Only us, together?

274
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:50,721
No way! Let's go three of us.

275
00:35:15,388 --> 00:35:20,091
SUNG HA

276
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:52,917
It's you, right?

277
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:57,420
Oh, sir?

278
00:35:59,415 --> 00:36:00,515
How have you been?

279
00:36:00,733 --> 00:36:03,880
Good. And you?
It's been so long.

280
00:36:04,286 --> 00:36:07,621
Yes, it really has.

281
00:36:09,941 --> 00:36:11,746
I heard you were
abroad somewhere.

282
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:15,805
I was in England a few years.
Please, have a seat.

283
00:36:16,649 --> 00:36:17,725
Shall I?

284
00:36:19,198 --> 00:36:23,934
It's take-out coffee.
A minute should be fine, right?

285
00:36:33,931 --> 00:36:37,532
Wow, it's been ages.

286
00:36:42,036 --> 00:36:45,884
I think I heard
you got married there?

287
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,554
Yes, that's right.

288
00:36:48,795 --> 00:36:50,548
It didn't work out, I came back.

289
00:36:52,221 --> 00:36:53,221
Together?

290
00:36:53,576 --> 00:36:56,595
No, by myself.
My wife is still in England.

291
00:36:59,121 --> 00:37:00,121
We've separated.

292
00:37:04,511 --> 00:37:06,071
Are you doing well?

293
00:37:11,502 --> 00:37:13,348
You're still doing
interesting work?

294
00:37:15,534 --> 00:37:20,610
As you know,
we photographers are struggling.

295
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:26,099
No good work,
I'm just on a downward slide.

296
00:37:26,723 --> 00:37:28,379
Bit by bit, as I get older.

297
00:37:33,281 --> 00:37:35,264
Do you come here often?

298
00:37:35,936 --> 00:37:38,574
No, it's my first time.

299
00:37:39,573 --> 00:37:41,337
I was just walking by.

300
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:48,071
It's amazing, really.
And here I meet you.

301
00:37:54,007 --> 00:37:55,574
Because I wanted a hot drink.

302
00:37:57,605 --> 00:38:01,447
It was sunny so I took a walk,
but it's still cold.

303
00:38:02,248 --> 00:38:05,139
- Winter's not done yet.
- That's right.

304
00:38:15,905 --> 00:38:19,099
When did you return to Korea?

305
00:38:19,992 --> 00:38:21,191
Last week.

306
00:38:22,825 --> 00:38:25,840
What will you do?
Publishing, again?

307
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:32,222
I've been away from Korean
for too long,

308
00:38:33,653 --> 00:38:35,505
but I'm looking for something.

309
00:38:36,531 --> 00:38:40,042
Sure. I'll see
if I can help somehow.

310
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,966
Oh my, thank you.

311
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:57,729
Chang-seok.

312
00:39:00,802 --> 00:39:01,906
To be honest,

313
00:39:05,805 --> 00:39:07,859
something amazing
happened to me.

314
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:12,216
Did you meet my wife?

315
00:39:14,003 --> 00:39:17,357
No, but I knew you were married.

316
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:19,402
That was a long time ago.

317
00:39:25,768 --> 00:39:27,027
You know what this is?

318
00:39:34,363 --> 00:39:36,122
It's cyanide.

319
00:39:40,113 --> 00:39:41,776
Really hard to find.

320
00:39:43,474 --> 00:39:44,729
I see.

321
00:39:46,886 --> 00:39:53,835
If you mix this in water,
it's painful but you die fast.

322
00:39:54,983 --> 00:39:56,690
About half a gram?

323
00:39:58,869 --> 00:39:59,869
This much...

324
00:40:11,167 --> 00:40:16,424
A few years ago, my wife
was diagnosed with breast cancer.

325
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:18,777
They operated right away,

326
00:40:21,162 --> 00:40:25,590
and the result was good,
but it had spread already.

327
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,315
From then on, things were hard.

328
00:40:30,975 --> 00:40:35,078
Around the end of last year,
we lost all hope.

329
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:44,023
I thought

330
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:51,266
that we were like an island.

331
00:40:57,593 --> 00:41:00,122
I bought this in order to go
when my wife does.

332
00:41:02,629 --> 00:41:04,172
Foolish, isn't it?

333
00:41:07,571 --> 00:41:10,481
Yes, I don't think
it's a good idea.

334
00:41:12,278 --> 00:41:13,278
You're right.

335
00:41:16,696 --> 00:41:17,996
I'm loyal, you know.

336
00:41:21,442 --> 00:41:23,836
There's no longer any
point in surgery,

337
00:41:25,432 --> 00:41:27,572
and my wife's body
is wasting away.

338
00:41:28,909 --> 00:41:32,375
Still, speaking openly
with my wife who's still alive,

339
00:41:33,186 --> 00:41:36,207
it's hard for people
to give up hope.

340
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:40,165
They start hanging on
to a different hope.

341
00:41:44,123 --> 00:41:46,191
You spend so much
on the silliest things.

342
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,250
But one day,

343
00:42:01,694 --> 00:42:07,318
my wife held my hand
and said she was scared.

344
00:42:09,981 --> 00:42:12,162
She got so scared
before going to sleep.

345
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:25,193
We tried a shamanic ceremony,
having her take lye,

346
00:42:26,073 --> 00:42:27,834
we tried everything,

347
00:42:30,322 --> 00:42:31,924
but nothing works.

348
00:42:35,321 --> 00:42:39,238
My wife got worse,

349
00:42:44,003 --> 00:42:51,026
and at last she was breathing,
but fell into a coma.

350
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,074
But you know,

351
00:43:01,332 --> 00:43:09,332
I met a Buddhist monk yesterday.
This might sound crazy to you.

352
00:43:10,399 --> 00:43:16,960
Instead of logic I tried mysticism,
and found a man with mystical power.

353
00:43:21,163 --> 00:43:25,797
I met him in a cafÃ©
in Insa-dong,

354
00:43:25,798 --> 00:43:29,761
and as soon as he saw me,
he pulled up my shirt,

355
00:43:31,324 --> 00:43:38,539
took a bamboo rod and
whipped my back about 100 times.

356
00:43:41,148 --> 00:43:44,804
It felt like my back
was on fire.

357
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,705
After he was done,

358
00:43:49,382 --> 00:43:54,001
he gave me a bottle this big
with yellow liquid in it.

359
00:43:54,908 --> 00:43:59,988
It was water that came up through
dead trees behind the temple,

360
00:44:01,684 --> 00:44:02,809
He spread it on my back,

361
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:05,016
He spread it on my back,

362
00:44:08,759 --> 00:44:11,321
and said to spread it
on my wife's wounds, too.

363
00:44:16,245 --> 00:44:19,559
I don't believe all that,
but people...

364
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,100
they need to hang
their hope on something.

365
00:44:25,002 --> 00:44:26,212
I went to the hospital,

366
00:44:28,661 --> 00:44:31,156
and was spreading it
on my wife's body,

367
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:38,751
when she opened her eyes
and looked at me.

368
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:43,273
She regained consciousness,
just last night!

369
00:44:46,332 --> 00:44:47,648
Isn't it amazing?

370
00:44:50,411 --> 00:44:51,870
Yes, it is.

371
00:44:57,202 --> 00:45:00,906
In the morning my wife said

372
00:45:02,019 --> 00:45:05,838
she dreamed a small bird
flew into her embrace.

373
00:45:09,712 --> 00:45:11,776
I held her hand and
looked out the window,

374
00:45:12,819 --> 00:45:15,952
and a sparrow came
and chirped at us.

375
00:45:18,195 --> 00:45:20,787
Seeing her smile,
I made up my mind.

376
00:45:21,938 --> 00:45:29,938
So I met the monk again, and
he whipped my back, spread ointment...

377
00:45:32,125 --> 00:45:35,057
But he told me
something else today.

378
00:45:36,231 --> 00:45:37,523
He said to go north.

379
00:45:39,253 --> 00:45:43,737
If I go north from where my wife is,
I'll meet a person with luck.

380
00:45:45,462 --> 00:45:48,679
I'll meet someone I once knew,
and that person will become my luck.

381
00:45:53,632 --> 00:45:54,772
Isn't it amazing?

382
00:45:57,253 --> 00:45:58,735
Yes, it is.

383
00:46:00,892 --> 00:46:04,000
He said after we talk,

384
00:46:05,105 --> 00:46:09,592
I'll go back and my wife will
greet me with a peaceful face.

385
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:14,728
Isn't that amazing?

386
00:46:16,963 --> 00:46:18,088
Yesâ€¦

387
00:46:18,089 --> 00:46:20,784
I don't believe
in miracles, either.

388
00:46:21,657 --> 00:46:29,635
But they come in the depths
of despair, miracles...

389
00:46:43,081 --> 00:46:44,478
Excuse me a second.

390
00:47:53,551 --> 00:47:55,091
I need to go to the hospital.

391
00:48:04,271 --> 00:48:05,509
My wife died.

392
00:49:46,513 --> 00:49:52,559
JU EUN

393
00:50:04,367 --> 00:50:05,501
Want anything else?

394
00:50:09,734 --> 00:50:11,859
This drink here...

395
00:50:12,365 --> 00:50:13,881
One highball, please.

396
00:50:14,842 --> 00:50:15,842
Yes.

397
00:50:28,523 --> 00:50:29,806
It's good.

398
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:35,351
It's a simple drink,
but it tastes good.

399
00:50:37,665 --> 00:50:41,116
If you like it strong,
I can add more whiskey.

400
00:50:42,749 --> 00:50:43,749
Really?

401
00:50:55,555 --> 00:50:57,775
Did you come in
to drink on your own?

402
00:51:01,517 --> 00:51:06,569
No, I was meeting someone here.

403
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:14,368
Guess that person's late.

404
00:51:15,727 --> 00:51:17,054
I came early.

405
00:51:25,338 --> 00:51:26,340
This is on the house.

406
00:51:28,582 --> 00:51:29,582
What?

407
00:51:31,606 --> 00:51:33,745
It's my last day working here.

408
00:52:10,738 --> 00:52:12,073
What are you writing?

409
00:52:21,057 --> 00:52:25,663
Just writing some notes.

410
00:52:34,913 --> 00:52:36,416
Am I staying too long?

411
00:52:38,519 --> 00:52:41,066
It's a long time before closing.
No problem.

412
00:52:42,222 --> 00:52:43,574
Take your time.

413
00:52:45,631 --> 00:52:48,519
I'm not the owner,
so stay as long as you like.

414
00:52:54,082 --> 00:52:55,882
Anyway you're waiting for someone,
aren't you?

415
00:53:06,608 --> 00:53:07,608
It's kind of amazing.

416
00:53:12,513 --> 00:53:16,532
It's rare to write things
in notebooks these days.

417
00:53:17,586 --> 00:53:18,857
Not many people do it.

418
00:53:20,456 --> 00:53:21,609
It's good to see.

419
00:53:24,926 --> 00:53:27,212
I like writing things down, too.

420
00:53:31,463 --> 00:53:33,330
I write poetry.

421
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:38,289
Poetry?

422
00:53:40,314 --> 00:53:42,947
I often write it in
the iPhone voice memo,

423
00:53:44,108 --> 00:53:46,602
but then I copy it all into this.

424
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:49,769
That's cool.

425
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:58,024
Writing poems doesn't
make you a poet.

426
00:53:59,942 --> 00:54:02,445
But still, you need to
let out your emotions.

427
00:54:08,407 --> 00:54:11,630
And I write poems
about the customers here.

428
00:54:13,981 --> 00:54:16,141
Not that they'd know.

429
00:54:17,707 --> 00:54:20,562
I feel a bit sorry sometimes.

430
00:54:22,832 --> 00:54:24,039
Now I know.

431
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:30,393
If I write a poem about you,
I'll apologize to you then.

432
00:54:33,636 --> 00:54:34,815
How do you write the poems?

433
00:54:35,708 --> 00:54:38,013
The poems?

434
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,124
First I hear their stories.

435
00:54:41,541 --> 00:54:44,598
I work here because
I'm curious about people.

436
00:54:46,333 --> 00:54:50,405
All kinds of people come in
and want to talk to me.

437
00:54:51,474 --> 00:54:53,195
Did you hear
a lot of good stories?

438
00:54:55,933 --> 00:54:59,060
You think that's likely?
Most aren't interesting.

439
00:55:02,162 --> 00:55:03,512
If someone's boring, I make up
a story about why they're boring.

440
00:55:03,513 --> 00:55:08,429
If someone's boring, I make up
a story about why they're boring.

441
00:55:09,857 --> 00:55:11,978
Still, you're really
interested in people.

442
00:55:18,448 --> 00:55:22,763
Actually, I kind of need
other people's memories.

443
00:55:23,417 --> 00:55:25,210
I don't have many myself.

444
00:55:36,868 --> 00:55:38,730
Have you ever been
in a car accident?

445
00:55:40,218 --> 00:55:41,432
No.

446
00:55:44,196 --> 00:55:47,914
I was in an accident
5 years ago.

447
00:55:49,828 --> 00:55:51,691
Riding on my friend's motorcycle,

448
00:55:52,272 --> 00:55:54,403
we hit a van and
I was hurt badly.

449
00:55:56,601 --> 00:55:58,475
That's what happened
to this eye.

450
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,074
See this tattoo?

451
00:56:06,135 --> 00:56:11,995
The tear in my skin goes down
below my navel.

452
00:56:13,849 --> 00:56:14,849
You see it?

453
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:17,373
Yes, I see.

454
00:56:23,344 --> 00:56:26,251
I woke up about a month later,

455
00:56:28,549 --> 00:56:33,896
and I guess because my head
hit the road, my memories were gone.

456
00:56:34,615 --> 00:56:35,811
Well, not everything.

457
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,052
Like in a cheesy movie.

458
00:56:41,911 --> 00:56:44,610
What I remembered was like
the whiskey in this bottle.

459
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:49,269
It was all empty.

460
00:56:52,443 --> 00:56:54,559
So I play a game sometimes.

461
00:57:00,004 --> 00:57:01,472
Buying memories.

462
00:57:03,394 --> 00:57:05,793
Since I just have to
believe what I hear.

463
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:10,071
Tell me an interesting memory,
and I'll buy you a drink.

464
00:57:16,374 --> 00:57:19,386
My memory?

465
00:57:19,825 --> 00:57:22,895
Yeah, just for customers
who I like.

466
00:57:23,845 --> 00:57:25,939
Any memory you want
to sell for a drink?

467
00:57:34,949 --> 00:57:36,250
You laugh a lot.

468
00:57:41,446 --> 00:57:45,698
Well, if I sell it,
it's no longer mine?

469
00:58:00,352 --> 00:58:05,187
It doesn't seem right
to give you a sad memory.

470
00:58:11,606 --> 00:58:15,885
When I was in university,
I lived in Imun-dong.

471
00:58:18,987 --> 00:58:21,099
Once on my way home from class,

472
00:58:24,502 --> 00:58:26,232
I saw a rabbit in the alley.

473
00:58:27,927 --> 00:58:30,938
It was squatting
near a streetlamp.

474
00:58:33,367 --> 00:58:35,619
A rabbit? In Seoul?

475
00:58:36,336 --> 00:58:37,348
Yeah.

476
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:43,801
So I squatted down too
and looked at the rabbit,

477
00:58:44,967 --> 00:58:47,430
but it didn't run away.

478
00:58:51,604 --> 00:58:53,932
A lady from a grocery store

479
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:59,785
squatted down next to me
and we both watched the rabbit.

480
00:59:04,039 --> 00:59:05,373
Someone must have abandoned it.

481
00:59:08,343 --> 00:59:10,524
That's what we thought, too.

482
00:59:14,465 --> 00:59:17,212
The lady brought some
cabbage from the store,

483
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:20,819
and the rabbit munched it up happily.

484
00:59:22,837 --> 00:59:30,620
There are lots of stray cats there,
and we worried it might get hurt.

485
00:59:31,861 --> 00:59:36,546
So the lady and I debated over
who would take it home.

486
00:59:38,069 --> 00:59:41,996
She said her husband
would never allow it.

487
00:59:43,265 --> 00:59:47,056
And I was living at my friend's place,
so it wasn't easy.

488
00:59:50,464 --> 00:59:54,149
Finally we played
paper, scissors, stone.

489
01:00:01,398 --> 01:00:02,622
I won.

490
01:00:05,976 --> 01:00:10,620
So she put the rabbit
in a box and took it.

491
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:17,436
So bye-bye to the rabbit?

492
01:00:18,177 --> 01:00:19,466
I saw it sometimes.

493
01:00:20,341 --> 01:00:24,728
She brought it to the store,
and walked it sometimes.

494
01:00:26,213 --> 01:00:29,381
They say rabbits live
about 6 years.

495
01:00:31,069 --> 01:00:36,555
This one lived 4 years
after we found it,

496
01:00:39,535 --> 01:00:41,403
so I guess it died
a natural death.

497
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:52,252
That's nice.
A happy ending.

498
01:00:55,375 --> 01:00:56,375
Then it's a deal?

499
01:00:57,455 --> 01:00:58,455
A deal!

500
01:01:34,735 --> 01:01:35,927
Do you smoke?

501
01:01:38,328 --> 01:01:39,742
I do,

502
01:01:43,268 --> 01:01:44,440
but I have no cigarettes.

503
01:02:46,314 --> 01:02:47,513
That glass is nice.

504
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:51,183
Isn't it?

505
01:02:52,276 --> 01:02:53,778
It's my favorite glass.

506
01:03:01,075 --> 01:03:02,077
It's amazing.

507
01:03:08,383 --> 01:03:09,383
Amazing?

508
01:03:11,498 --> 01:03:14,512
This is a useful place.

509
01:03:16,183 --> 01:03:20,112
You get memories,
write poetry...

510
01:03:25,323 --> 01:03:27,382
Still, it's my last day.

511
01:03:32,673 --> 01:03:35,114
But the person you're
waiting for is really late.

512
01:04:08,006 --> 01:04:09,539
He waits.

513
01:04:12,099 --> 01:04:14,198
Slowly emptying his glass.

514
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:17,847
Amidst silence and conversation,

515
01:04:19,122 --> 01:04:23,257
and his white lies, he waits.

516
01:04:25,693 --> 01:04:30,900
In fact, when he said he is waiting,
he became someone who waits.

517
01:04:34,030 --> 01:04:36,056
No one is coming,

518
01:04:37,172 --> 01:04:39,044
but he's someone who waits.

519
01:05:17,634 --> 01:05:22,538
CHANG SEOK

520
01:09:00,495 --> 01:09:03,284
- Hello?
- It's me.

521
01:09:07,152 --> 01:09:08,227
It's me.

522
01:09:10,117 --> 01:09:11,117
Yeah.

523
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:16,235
Have you been well?

524
01:09:19,716 --> 01:09:20,716
So-so.

525
01:09:22,253 --> 01:09:23,253
Yeah.

526
01:09:29,913 --> 01:09:31,789
Spring is late here.

527
01:09:34,365 --> 01:09:35,365
Really?

528
01:09:36,214 --> 01:09:37,214
Yeah.

529
01:09:41,952 --> 01:09:43,708
Did you finish your writing?

530
01:09:45,452 --> 01:09:46,452
Yeah.

531
01:09:49,305 --> 01:09:50,507
I'm curious.

532
01:09:52,902 --> 01:09:53,996
It'll be out soon.

533
01:09:57,099 --> 01:09:58,099
Will you read it?

534
01:09:58,795 --> 01:10:02,202
No. I'm not ready.

535
01:10:04,651 --> 01:10:06,636
Later I'll try reading it.

536
01:10:07,409 --> 01:10:08,409
Sure.

537
01:10:25,156 --> 01:10:26,590
I'm still okay.

538
01:10:28,704 --> 01:10:29,704
Huh?

539
01:10:31,713 --> 01:10:36,058
I'm still okay.
I can try more.

540
01:10:38,792 --> 01:10:44,734
If you agree,
I think we can try again.

541
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:54,078
I think we tried a lot.

542
01:10:57,977 --> 01:10:59,697
I thought so...

543
01:11:03,487 --> 01:11:05,157
But can't we try again?

544
01:11:10,182 --> 01:11:11,605
It's still cold here.

545
01:11:14,445 --> 01:11:15,740
Here, too.

546
01:11:25,032 --> 01:11:26,703
Can I go back there?

547
01:11:33,845 --> 01:11:35,041
Can I?

548
01:11:39,695 --> 01:11:41,092
If we try again...

549
01:11:43,925 --> 01:11:45,302
might it work this time?

550
01:12:01,603 --> 01:12:05,144
Okay, come.

551
01:12:07,297 --> 01:12:08,463
I miss you.

552
01:12:11,202 --> 01:12:12,202
Okay.

553
01:12:16,072 --> 01:12:19,966
I'll buy a ticket,
the soonest I can.

554
01:12:21,790 --> 01:12:25,272
Come quickly.

555
01:12:25,556 --> 01:12:26,766
I miss you.

556
01:12:32,376 --> 01:12:33,464
Me too.

557
01:12:39,812 --> 01:12:41,045
I miss you, too.

558
01:12:45,323 --> 01:12:52,575
Soo-yeon wants
her dad back, too.

559
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:18,820
But Soo-yeon died...

560
01:13:21,547 --> 01:13:22,867
What do you mean?

561
01:13:25,019 --> 01:13:27,514
She's sleeping tight
right next to me.

562
01:18:30,886 --> 01:18:32,535
You need to follow the wind!

563
01:18:34,041 --> 01:18:35,041
Wow!

564
01:18:36,394 --> 01:18:39,774
I see hope!
Move the ship's sails.

565
01:18:39,775 --> 01:18:41,828
Move the ship's sails!

566
01:18:41,829 --> 01:18:43,212
Come here, hold my hand!

567
01:18:44,765 --> 01:18:46,392
This way you won't get lost.

568
01:18:58,193 --> 01:19:03,586
The mother held the child's
small hand tight.

569
01:19:05,261 --> 01:19:07,742
They vanished at
the end of the alley.

570
01:19:09,898 --> 01:19:12,137
I walked the empty alleys,

571
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:17,654
and dreamed that night.
