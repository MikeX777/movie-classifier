1
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:08,412
No!

2
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,373
- Death
Finish is our medley

3
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:54,375
for all you out there on the
graveyard shift.

4
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:55,834
This is your old buddy
the night owl

5
00:02:56,168 --> 00:02:57,878
bringin' it to ya till 5:00am.

6
00:02:58,212 --> 00:03:00,672
We'll be back with a mellow
medley of more music

7
00:03:01,006 --> 00:03:01,590
right after this.

8
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:04,927
# Maybe had a hard day at work

9
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,806
# And no one talks to me

10
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:10,933
# Maybe had a hard day at work

11
00:03:29,243 --> 00:03:31,870
Day 457.

12
00:03:32,204 --> 00:03:34,081
Another night, another nightmare.

13
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,709
At least I'm alive and
out of the life.

14
00:03:39,128 --> 00:03:42,214
Lord knows I'd rather die before I
turn another trick.

15
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,592
Anything would be better,
even this.

16
00:03:49,805 --> 00:03:50,556
Ow!

17
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:51,515
Blood.

18
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,519
Whoa.

19
00:04:18,542 --> 00:04:20,544
Top of the morning to ya.

20
00:04:20,878 --> 00:04:22,087
How'd you sleep?

21
00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:23,714
Not so good.

22
00:04:24,047 --> 00:04:25,757
The same nightmare again?

23
00:04:26,091 --> 00:04:26,633
Yeah.

24
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:28,802
It never ends.

25
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:34,057
You take him.

26
00:04:34,391 --> 00:04:35,309
I already got a couple live ones.

27
00:04:41,356 --> 00:04:43,484
Can I get you somethin'?

28
00:04:48,906 --> 00:04:52,784
- Give me a coffee, and a
waitress over easy.

29
00:04:54,244 --> 00:04:56,997
- How about some hot coffee
all over your lap?

30
00:05:00,042 --> 00:05:01,877
No offense, uh, Nora.

31
00:05:02,211 --> 00:05:05,088
I gotta do somethin' to
fight off the boredom.

32
00:05:05,422 --> 00:05:06,715
Now you may not believe it,

33
00:05:07,049 --> 00:05:09,343
but I don't make many sales this
time of the evening.

34
00:05:12,387 --> 00:05:14,014
<i>Okay, I'll bite.</i>

35
00:05:14,348 --> 00:05:15,224
What do you sell?

36
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:18,852
The product line of the 80s,

37
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:23,690
condoms, prophylactics, rubbers.

38
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:25,442
Everyone needs 'em.

39
00:05:25,776 --> 00:05:27,361
Can't live without 'em.

40
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:30,948
Age, you know, safe sex.

41
00:05:33,784 --> 00:05:37,079
If you've got some time, I can
arrange a personal demo,

42
00:05:37,412 --> 00:05:40,040
say your place or maybe the
backseat of my car.

43
00:05:53,762 --> 00:05:57,724
- Gee thanks, but I've got a
splitting headache.

44
00:05:59,184 --> 00:06:04,231
There you go.

45
00:06:43,812 --> 00:06:44,479
Hello.

46
00:06:46,315 --> 00:06:47,774
What can I get you tonight?

47
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:52,279
- Afriendly face, a little decent
companionship maybe.

48
00:06:54,573 --> 00:06:56,366
That's not on the menu.

49
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,200
Ah.

50
00:07:00,329 --> 00:07:02,122
I know what you mean.

51
00:07:05,042 --> 00:07:06,543
My name's John Henry Cox.

52
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:08,795
It's easy to remember.

53
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:12,966
I know too many Johns already.

54
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,176
I'll call you Henry.

55
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,929
I'm Nora Edwards.

56
00:07:18,263 --> 00:07:19,389
It's nice to meet you, Nora.

57
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:25,395
I know this is personal
and absolutely

58
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:27,481
none of my business, but are
you by any chance

59
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,191
married or involved with somebody?

60
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:31,151
No.

61
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,073
Then sometimes you must get

62
00:07:36,406 --> 00:07:37,741
as sad and lonely as I am.

63
00:07:47,084 --> 00:07:49,044
Do you ever think about
leaving this?

64
00:07:49,378 --> 00:07:50,337
Never looking back?

65
00:07:53,465 --> 00:07:54,341
All the time.

66
00:07:56,301 --> 00:07:57,594
If the right man came along,

67
00:07:57,928 --> 00:07:59,096
could you do it on impulse?

68
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:03,225
I don't know.

69
00:08:03,558 --> 00:08:04,142
Maybe.

70
00:08:04,476 --> 00:08:05,143
If I was the right man,

71
00:08:05,477 --> 00:08:07,396
would you come away with me?

72
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:11,108
Henry, you don't even know me.

73
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:13,985
There are people out there

74
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,195
who spend their whole lives
together, Nora,

75
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:17,155
and they don't really
know each other.

76
00:08:22,619 --> 00:08:23,870
What I'm offering us both,

77
00:08:31,503 --> 00:08:32,170
is a chance.

78
00:08:34,005 --> 00:08:35,882
Henry, it's beautiful.

79
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:40,512
It's a family heirloom.

80
00:08:46,518 --> 00:08:47,060
You're bleeding.

81
00:08:48,645 --> 00:08:50,355
It's nothing, really.

82
00:08:50,689 --> 00:08:55,444
Will you marry me, Nora?

83
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:10,125
Will you marry me, Nora?

84
00:09:12,878 --> 00:09:13,920
Yes, Henry.

85
00:09:15,505 --> 00:09:16,423
I'll marry you.

86
00:09:17,466 --> 00:09:19,092
Come away with me tonight, now.

87
00:09:20,969 --> 00:09:23,388
- I can't leave in the
middle of my shift.

88
00:09:23,722 --> 00:09:26,349
I have clothes and my stuff.

89
00:09:26,683 --> 00:09:27,267
I'll send for them.

90
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:28,351
I'll buy you new clothes.

91
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:38,153
Where are you going, honey?

92
00:09:38,487 --> 00:09:39,571
This is Henry.

93
00:09:39,905 --> 00:09:41,364
We're gettin' married.

94
00:09:41,698 --> 00:09:43,742
- I guess some girls
have all the luck.

95
00:09:44,075 --> 00:09:45,327
Congratulations!

96
00:09:46,411 --> 00:09:47,621
Do you have any idea what the hell

97
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,414
you're getting yourself into?

98
00:09:49,748 --> 00:09:52,083
- No, but I've been
waiting an eternity

99
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:53,502
for an offer this good.

100
00:09:53,835 --> 00:09:55,212
Didn't you see his limo?

101
00:09:56,838 --> 00:10:00,050
- Oh, the best of luck to you,
both of you!

102
00:10:00,383 --> 00:10:02,427
Send me a postcard from
your honeymoon.

103
00:10:16,608 --> 00:10:18,401
Where are we going?

104
00:10:18,735 --> 00:10:20,111
It's a little town

105
00:10:20,445 --> 00:10:22,697
about 100 miles up the interstate,

106
00:10:23,031 --> 00:10:24,449
a place called Newbury.

107
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,665
Your car is beautiful.

108
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:35,460
By the way, what
exactly do you do?

109
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,174
I own my own business.

110
00:10:42,592 --> 00:10:44,135
Been in the family
three generations.

111
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:12,289
My friends, this is Nora Edwards,

112
00:11:12,622 --> 00:11:14,124
the woman I'm going to marry.

113
00:11:14,457 --> 00:11:16,001
This is Sheriff Potter.

114
00:11:16,334 --> 00:11:19,838
- Glad to meet you, and
welcome to Newbury.

115
00:11:20,171 --> 00:11:21,923
- Ms. Strickland, she
runs the library.

116
00:11:22,257 --> 00:11:22,924
Call me Emmaline.

117
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:26,136
So glad to meet you, my dear.

118
00:11:26,469 --> 00:11:28,263
He's quite a lady killer,
you know.

119
00:11:28,597 --> 00:11:31,266
- And this is Bill
Billings, president of the bank.

120
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,767
Nice catch, John Henry.

121
00:11:33,101 --> 00:11:34,895
Are there any more
like you at home?

122
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:36,271
I don't know.

123
00:11:36,605 --> 00:11:37,564
I grew up in foster homes.

124
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:39,357
I've never had a family.

125
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,068
Well, you do now, my dear.

126
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,990
- Reverend Collins. - Welcome,
Nora.

127
00:11:48,617 --> 00:11:49,576
Is everything ready?

128
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:53,538
Just like you asked for.

129
00:11:53,872 --> 00:11:55,415
Come this way, my dear.

130
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:57,417
We have to get you dressed.

131
00:11:57,751 --> 00:12:00,337
- Dressed? - For the wedding,
of course.

132
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:17,270
Fits you like it was made for you.

133
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:19,022
It's beautiful.

134
00:12:19,356 --> 00:12:21,775
- Oh yes, it belonged
to Henry's wife.

135
00:12:23,526 --> 00:12:25,070
His wife?

136
00:12:25,403 --> 00:12:27,697
- Didn't he tell you that
he was a widower?

137
00:12:31,326 --> 00:12:32,035
Is she ready yet?

138
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:33,745
It's time.

139
00:12:55,558 --> 00:12:59,479
- Dear friends, we are
assembled here tonight

140
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:02,941
to join in marriage this
man and this woman,

141
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:08,446
to love and cherish in
sickness and in health

142
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,156
till death do you part.

143
00:13:14,285 --> 00:13:16,871
Do you, John Henry,
take Nora to be

144
00:13:17,205 --> 00:13:18,456
your lawful wedded wife?

145
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,582
I do.

146
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,544
Do you, Nora, take John Henry

147
00:13:22,877 --> 00:13:24,379
to be your lawful wedded husband?

148
00:13:25,797 --> 00:13:26,464
Z'!

149
00:13:33,805 --> 00:13:35,098
Do.

150
00:13:35,432 --> 00:13:38,351
- I now pronounce you
man and wife.

151
00:13:41,104 --> 00:13:42,188
To Nora and John Henry.

152
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:45,483
To Nora and John Henry.

153
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:07,088
- Heard you got
yourself a new bride.

154
00:14:07,422 --> 00:14:09,549
We just stopped by to
wish you well.

155
00:14:11,134 --> 00:14:13,178
- Thank you all for coming by,
but not tonight.

156
00:14:14,471 --> 00:14:15,722
Ah, come on.

157
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:17,849
Let us have a look.

158
00:14:18,183 --> 00:14:19,142
Bring her out.

159
00:14:19,476 --> 00:14:21,227
What's the harm?

160
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:22,979
I said not tonight.

161
00:14:26,941 --> 00:14:27,567
Who was that?

162
00:14:28,818 --> 00:14:30,487
Just some friends of the family.

163
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,949
- There are a couple
of formalities.

164
00:14:35,283 --> 00:14:37,911
Just to make it legal.

165
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:39,704
There's the blood test.

166
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:45,585
Well, since I gave the
bride away myself,

167
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,670
we can dispense with it.

168
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:53,885
What is your full name?

169
00:14:54,219 --> 00:14:56,513
Nora Mae Edwards.

170
00:14:56,846 --> 00:15:01,059
Date of birth? - March 15th,

171
00:15:01,392 --> 00:15:02,769
She's just the right age.

172
00:15:06,648 --> 00:15:09,109
For getting married and
settling down.

173
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:11,611
We best be on our way.

174
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:14,781
- Leave the newlyweds
to their night.

175
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:32,799
I love you, Nora Cox.

176
00:15:33,925 --> 00:15:36,010
- And I'm going to learn to
love you too, Henry.

177
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:43,518
You know, I generally
don't do this

178
00:15:43,852 --> 00:15:45,395
on the first date.

179
00:15:45,728 --> 00:15:47,313
- I know you're not
that kind of girl.

180
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:18,261
Welcome to the bridal suite.

181
00:16:18,595 --> 00:16:21,681
- Henry, the
bed is so cold.

182
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,975
I like it a little cold.

183
00:16:46,915 --> 00:16:49,417
You know I want your body.

184
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,255
What would you like me to do?

185
00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:57,091
Lie still, be still.

186
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:04,766
I said be still.

187
00:17:45,515 --> 00:17:46,724
Good morning.

188
00:17:47,058 --> 00:17:49,394
I see you found something to wear.

189
00:17:49,727 --> 00:17:51,813
- There is a closet full of
clothes upstairs

190
00:17:52,146 --> 00:17:53,731
and they're all my size.

191
00:17:54,065 --> 00:17:55,608
Did you sleep all right?

192
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:57,652
- Actually, it feels
a little weird

193
00:17:57,986 --> 00:17:58,861
being up during the day.

194
00:17:59,195 --> 00:18:00,863
I'm used to working the graveyard.

195
00:18:01,197 --> 00:18:02,615
I mean, nights.

196
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:04,200
What time is it, anyway?

197
00:18:05,493 --> 00:18:06,828
We don't have clocks here

198
00:18:08,413 --> 00:18:10,540
because time doesn't matter to
my clients anymore.

199
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:15,003
Would you like to see the
rest of your domain?

200
00:18:15,336 --> 00:18:16,629
Yeah.

201
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:19,340
- Through this hall is the
dining room and kitchen.

202
00:18:21,718 --> 00:18:23,553
And this gallery leads
to the mortuary.

203
00:18:24,846 --> 00:18:25,763
Why didn't you tell me?

204
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,600
- My father brought me up
in this house,

205
00:18:29,934 --> 00:18:31,602
taught me this business,
and left it to me

206
00:18:31,936 --> 00:18:33,521
when he passed on.

207
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,189
Over the years, I've come to learn

208
00:18:35,523 --> 00:18:37,400
that some people have an
unnatural revulsion

209
00:18:37,734 --> 00:18:40,403
to my profession, to the thought

210
00:18:40,737 --> 00:18:42,864
of coming into contact
with dead flesh.

211
00:18:44,115 --> 00:18:44,782
I can live with it.

212
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:49,287
But why didn't you tell me you've
been married before?

213
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,998
Doesn't really matter, does it?

214
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:01,257
This is where we display the
deceased for the loved ones.

215
00:19:03,468 --> 00:19:05,011
Those are the parlor rooms.

216
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:14,187
And this is the preparing room,

217
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,857
where we get the bodies ready.

218
00:19:26,115 --> 00:19:27,283
You must promise me you will never

219
00:19:27,617 --> 00:19:28,659
try to go in there.

220
00:19:28,993 --> 00:19:29,911
But I-

221
00:19:30,244 --> 00:19:31,579
- Some doors are best
left unopened.

222
00:19:31,913 --> 00:19:33,414
Some things best left alone.

223
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:42,673
After breakfast, you might want
to explore Newbury.

224
00:19:43,007 --> 00:19:44,801
Maybe I'll just watch some TV.

225
00:19:45,134 --> 00:19:46,094
We don't have a TV.

226
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,264
I've got business at the
florist and cemetery.

227
00:19:50,598 --> 00:19:52,183
I'll see you when I get back.

228
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,625
No clocks, no TV.

229
00:20:19,377 --> 00:20:23,047
What do they do around here
for entertainment?

230
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:25,920
Morley!

231
00:22:26,254 --> 00:22:27,797
Oh, you startled me.

232
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,091
I didn't hear you come in.

233
00:22:32,093 --> 00:22:33,261
Nice day, huh?

234
00:22:33,594 --> 00:22:36,097
Thought I'd tale a walk around,
you know.

235
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,723
I think I'll go now.

236
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:39,016
It was nice talking to you.

237
00:22:43,437 --> 00:22:45,940
That Morley guy sure is
a strange one.

238
00:23:06,544 --> 00:23:07,545
Hey boys and girls,

239
00:23:07,878 --> 00:23:09,130
it's your old buddy the night owl

240
00:23:09,463 --> 00:23:12,008
covering for JJ on the
nine to noon shift

241
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:15,177
right here where the hits
just keep on comin'.

242
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,264
# Die young

243
00:23:21,517 --> 00:23:25,813
# Yeah, yeah # Die young

244
00:23:36,324 --> 00:23:39,201
# Well Jimi Hendrix he
never got old

245
00:23:39,535 --> 00:23:41,412
# Took some pills in his bathrobe,
woo

246
00:23:48,044 --> 00:23:49,211
# Die young

247
00:23:49,545 --> 00:23:51,005
# What you waitin' for

248
00:23:51,339 --> 00:23:52,131
# Die young

249
00:23:52,465 --> 00:23:53,966
# I gotta know, I gotta know, yeah

250
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,217
# Die young

251
00:23:59,221 --> 00:24:02,725
# I don't care what the
critics say, no way

252
00:24:46,435 --> 00:24:47,853
It's the Matthews girl.

253
00:24:48,187 --> 00:24:50,022
Somebody notify her brother,

254
00:24:50,356 --> 00:24:51,982
and get Reverend Collins up here.

255
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:56,153
Poor kid, I hope it was painless.

256
00:24:56,487 --> 00:24:59,323
- It doesn't look to me like
she was unconscious.

257
00:24:59,657 --> 00:25:01,325
Probably writhed around in there

258
00:25:01,659 --> 00:25:04,120
trapped underwater,
gasping and choking

259
00:25:04,453 --> 00:25:07,248
for a good minute before
she ran outta air.

260
00:25:07,581 --> 00:25:08,791
That must have been hideous.

261
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,295
No evidence of foul play.

262
00:25:13,629 --> 00:25:15,214
You know how kids drive today.

263
00:25:28,185 --> 00:25:29,186
What happened?

264
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,189
- Terrible introduction
to Newbury, Nora.

265
00:25:33,524 --> 00:25:35,109
Poor little girl just
lost her life

266
00:25:35,443 --> 00:25:36,694
out there in the pond.

267
00:25:38,988 --> 00:25:40,281
Can I give you a lift?

268
00:25:42,283 --> 00:25:43,242
No, thanks.

269
00:25:48,372 --> 00:25:49,749
Sure is a shame.

270
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:51,792
Ain't enough live ones
to go around.

271
00:25:53,461 --> 00:25:55,796
- Anybody ever tell ya you got a
morbid sense of humor?

272
00:25:57,506 --> 00:26:00,134
# It ain't no fake, you
know I was real

273
00:26:00,468 --> 00:26:02,011
# I could tell by the way

274
00:26:02,344 --> 00:26:04,305
Yep, she sure is cute.

275
00:26:04,638 --> 00:26:07,183
One of the cutest dead
girls I ever saw.

276
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:10,269
# Die young

277
00:26:13,606 --> 00:26:14,857
# Oh, I gotta know, yeah

278
00:26:15,191 --> 00:26:16,150
# Die young

279
00:26:18,235 --> 00:26:20,279
# Die young

280
00:26:20,613 --> 00:26:21,530
# Die young

281
00:26:21,864 --> 00:26:23,240
# 'Cause you got to go

282
00:26:23,574 --> 00:26:24,575
# Die young

283
00:26:26,702 --> 00:26:27,453
# Die young

284
00:26:27,787 --> 00:26:29,538
# I gotta know, I gotta know,
uh-huh

285
00:26:29,872 --> 00:26:31,332
# Die young

286
00:26:37,838 --> 00:26:40,925
# It ain't no fake, you
know I was real

287
00:26:41,258 --> 00:26:43,636
# I can tell by the way
that those feel

288
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:46,347
# And in about 10,000 years

289
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,183
# They'll remember through
a million tears

290
00:26:49,517 --> 00:26:50,476
# Die young

291
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,269
# What you cryin' for

292
00:26:52,603 --> 00:26:53,646
# Die young

293
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:55,272
# I gotta know, I gotta know, yeah

294
00:26:55,606 --> 00:26:56,482
# Die young

295
00:26:56,816 --> 00:26:58,359
# It's just begun, uh huh

296
00:26:58,692 --> 00:27:01,111
# Die young

297
00:27:01,445 --> 00:27:03,239
# Die young

298
00:27:03,572 --> 00:27:05,491
Yeah, I love you too, baby.

299
00:27:07,493 --> 00:27:08,244
# Die a young

300
00:27:08,577 --> 00:27:11,372
# I gotta know, I gotta know,
uh-huh

301
00:27:11,705 --> 00:27:13,249
- What are you doing,
man?

302
00:27:13,582 --> 00:27:14,625
We're in no hurry.

303
00:27:14,959 --> 00:27:16,085
She's got all day.

304
00:27:27,805 --> 00:27:28,514
Can I help you?

305
00:27:30,891 --> 00:27:33,811
- I'm Evan Matthews,
I'm her brother.

306
00:27:34,144 --> 00:27:35,020
Ah, yes.

307
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:36,397
I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you.

308
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:42,403
Since my parents died,

309
00:27:42,736 --> 00:27:44,154
she was the only one I had left.

310
00:27:46,574 --> 00:27:47,741
And now she's gone.

311
00:27:50,494 --> 00:27:51,579
Now it's just me.

312
00:27:51,912 --> 00:27:54,331
- Evan, I know how you
must feel right now

313
00:27:54,665 --> 00:27:56,542
but now is the time to be strong.

314
00:27:56,876 --> 00:27:57,501
Come and sit down.

315
00:28:03,465 --> 00:28:06,427
- I can't
believe she's dead.

316
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:12,892
Did she have any, feel any pain?

317
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:14,810
- I was told she didn't
feel a thing.

318
00:28:22,651 --> 00:28:24,653
This is my bride, Nora.

319
00:28:24,987 --> 00:28:27,448
Nora, sit with him a while,
if you would.

320
00:28:27,781 --> 00:28:30,451
I have some
arrangements to attend to.

321
00:28:30,784 --> 00:28:33,329
We'll talk about the economics
when you feel up to it.

322
00:29:36,183 --> 00:29:37,851
Well, if you're so
concerned about it,

323
00:29:38,185 --> 00:29:39,520
you better go check.

324
00:30:01,792 --> 00:30:05,546
# I don't wanna let you go, lady

325
00:30:05,879 --> 00:30:09,258
# I don't wanna let you go, lady

326
00:30:09,591 --> 00:30:11,510
# You brought laughter to my soul

327
00:30:11,844 --> 00:30:13,387
# And now you're in control

328
00:30:13,721 --> 00:30:16,640
# I don't wanna let you go

329
00:30:16,974 --> 00:30:21,103
# Come and dance a
little closer to me

330
00:30:21,437 --> 00:30:24,398
Doesn't she look lovely?

331
00:30:24,732 --> 00:30:28,444
# Oh, that's why our love was
never meant to be

332
00:30:28,777 --> 00:30:30,571
# Come on and get close to me

333
00:30:30,904 --> 00:30:33,741
- Yes, beautiful,
just beautiful.

334
00:30:37,745 --> 00:30:39,705
- It won't be long now,
my friends.

335
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:42,374
Just a few more little odds and
ends to attend to.

336
00:30:43,834 --> 00:30:47,212
# Come on and let me see you smile

337
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:49,590
# I don't wanna let you go, lady

338
00:30:49,923 --> 00:30:51,508
And then...

339
00:30:51,842 --> 00:30:54,887
# I don't wanna let you go, lady

340
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,473
# You brought laughter to my soul

341
00:30:57,806 --> 00:30:58,932
# And now you're in control

342
00:30:59,266 --> 00:31:02,352
# I don't wanna let you go

343
00:31:02,686 --> 00:31:05,481
# I wanna hold you with
my arms tonight

344
00:31:05,814 --> 00:31:07,399
# We will be all right

345
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:10,110
# Hold me tighter

346
00:31:10,444 --> 00:31:12,905
# I wanna kiss you in the
clear moonlight

347
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:14,364
# It will be all right

348
00:31:23,082 --> 00:31:27,586
# She was an
beauty queen

349
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:32,424
# Lovely as only in a dream

350
00:31:32,758 --> 00:31:36,261
# She knew just how to turn me on

351
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:37,805
# She teased me all night

352
00:31:38,138 --> 00:31:42,434
# With that good old
fashioned girly charm

353
00:31:42,768 --> 00:31:47,147
# I thought we'd have
another round

354
00:31:47,481 --> 00:31:49,358
All right, everyone.

355
00:31:49,691 --> 00:31:50,400
Stand clear.

356
00:31:52,069 --> 00:31:55,864
# I crossed my arms
around her hips

357
00:31:56,198 --> 00:31:57,658
# I pulled her body close

358
00:31:57,991 --> 00:32:00,911
# And gently kissed
her crimson lips

359
00:32:01,245 --> 00:32:03,247
# But when I tried to make my move

360
00:32:05,833 --> 00:32:07,584
# I don't sleep with strangers

361
00:32:07,918 --> 00:32:09,962
# I'm not that kind of girl

362
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:12,506
# Strangers are for dancing

363
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,592
# Not chancing, romancing

364
00:32:15,926 --> 00:32:17,511
# I don't sleep with strangers

365
00:32:17,845 --> 00:32:19,930
# I'm careful from the start

366
00:32:20,264 --> 00:32:25,018
# I won't let a stranger
endanger my heart

367
00:32:27,354 --> 00:32:31,525
# I grew impatient with her game

368
00:32:31,859 --> 00:32:36,488
# I had an image you maintained

369
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:40,784
# But as I turned to walk away

370
00:32:45,873 --> 00:32:47,332
# And as she drew me close

371
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:50,294
# These were the words
I heard her say

372
00:32:50,627 --> 00:32:52,838
# I don't sleep with strangers

373
00:32:53,172 --> 00:32:54,923
- And best of all,
she's safe.

374
00:32:55,257 --> 00:32:57,759
It's safe sex now because
we can't get AIDS

375
00:32:58,093 --> 00:32:58,677
from dead people.

376
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:02,973
# I don't sleep with strangers

377
00:33:03,307 --> 00:33:06,268
- I think maybe the
honeymoon is over.

378
00:33:58,904 --> 00:34:01,531
- I didn't
mean to wake you.

379
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:04,576
You're dressed.

380
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:05,869
Where were you?

381
00:34:06,203 --> 00:34:06,995
Downstairs.

382
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:11,416
There was some work to be done
on the Matthews girl.

383
00:34:14,044 --> 00:34:17,089
I thought I heard something.

384
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:19,591
- Old houses make
sounds all their own.

385
00:34:21,009 --> 00:34:22,344
Were you alone?

386
00:34:22,678 --> 00:34:23,428
No, Morley was with me.

387
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:24,805
Nobody else.

388
00:34:25,138 --> 00:34:26,139
Unless you count the body.

389
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:32,020
I know this all seems a
little strange,

390
00:34:32,354 --> 00:34:33,480
but you'll get used to it.

391
00:34:36,024 --> 00:34:39,319
- I guess I must have
been dreaming.

392
00:34:39,653 --> 00:34:41,989
- And nothing real is ever
quite as frightening

393
00:34:42,322 --> 00:34:43,448
as it is in our dreams.

394
00:35:28,076 --> 00:35:29,453
Mr. Matthews.

395
00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:31,913
Call me Evan, please.

396
00:35:34,124 --> 00:35:34,791
Sure.

397
00:35:38,337 --> 00:35:40,422
I'm sorry about your
tragic loss Mister,

398
00:35:40,756 --> 00:35:41,673
Evan. - Thank you.

399
00:35:44,843 --> 00:35:45,886
Have you seen Henry?

400
00:35:51,641 --> 00:35:52,934
Henry?

401
00:35:53,268 --> 00:35:55,103
Are you in here?

402
00:35:55,437 --> 00:35:58,190
That's odd, the door's open.

403
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:00,734
Morley said he was in there.

404
00:36:01,068 --> 00:36:02,027
Well, he didn't actually say it.

405
00:36:02,361 --> 00:36:04,154
He just sort of gestured.

406
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,718
Nora, good morning to you.

407
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:16,393
Hey everybody, this is Nora Cox,

408
00:37:16,726 --> 00:37:18,478
Henry's new wife.

409
00:37:20,063 --> 00:37:21,898
What can I get you, honey?

410
00:37:22,232 --> 00:37:25,402
- Just coffee, thank you. -
Coming right up.

411
00:37:28,405 --> 00:37:30,323
She married the undertaker?

412
00:37:31,658 --> 00:37:33,535
Yep, she married the undertaker.

413
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:43,128
- Well, how do you like our
little town, Nora?

414
00:37:45,922 --> 00:37:47,007
Huh?

415
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,551
Oh, it seems very nice, thank you.

416
00:38:02,022 --> 00:38:02,981
Oh!

417
00:38:03,315 --> 00:38:04,107
Oh.

418
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:07,861
I'm sorry about the mess.

419
00:38:08,195 --> 00:38:10,030
I never used to be this clumsy.

420
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:12,782
How much do I owe you?

421
00:38:14,201 --> 00:38:18,371
- As long as its on the house,
it's on the house.

422
00:38:18,705 --> 00:38:19,956
Well, I have to go now.

423
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:21,082
Thank you.

424
00:38:26,129 --> 00:38:28,924
Welcome to Newbury, Nora.

425
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:40,227
- Why don't you look where
you're goin', young lady!

426
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,395
Oh, Nora, it's you.

427
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,527
Here it is.

428
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,819
We call it home.

429
00:38:51,238 --> 00:38:51,947
Take a seat.

430
00:38:53,573 --> 00:38:56,785
How about a nice cup of
hot chocolate?

431
00:38:57,118 --> 00:39:00,372
- Oh thanks, no, the caffeine
keeps me up all night.

432
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:03,875
Could I trouble you for a
glass of water?

433
00:39:04,209 --> 00:39:07,128
No trouble at all.

434
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:18,098
You do seem a little jittery.

435
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,520
I know it's none of my business,
but,

436
00:39:23,853 --> 00:39:27,148
is anything wrong between
you and your new...

437
00:39:29,651 --> 00:39:30,735
Everything's fine.

438
00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:33,697
It's just that I don't
really know anyone.

439
00:39:37,284 --> 00:39:39,995
Well, it takes a while for folks

440
00:39:40,328 --> 00:39:42,497
to get used to the local customs,

441
00:39:42,831 --> 00:39:47,586
but folks is folks once you
get to know 'em.

442
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,969
Where are you from, anyway?

443
00:39:58,054 --> 00:39:59,180
Out of state.

444
00:39:59,514 --> 00:40:01,266
I used to live in New York.

445
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,059
That was a long time ago.

446
00:40:03,393 --> 00:40:05,186
Seems like another lifetime now.

447
00:40:06,563 --> 00:40:10,400
- You know, Nora, when I
get to feelin' blue

448
00:40:10,734 --> 00:40:14,779
I go out and get
myself a good book,

449
00:40:15,113 --> 00:40:18,575
one of them murder mysteries

450
00:40:18,908 --> 00:40:21,494
or somethin' by Stephen King.

451
00:40:22,871 --> 00:40:26,291
Everybody needs a good scare
once in a while,

452
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:27,167
don't you think?

453
00:40:32,297 --> 00:40:33,256
I guess so.

454
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:37,594
- Why don't you wander on
up to the library

455
00:40:37,927 --> 00:40:40,055
and see Ms. Strickland?

456
00:40:40,388 --> 00:40:43,892
I'm sure she'd be happy to
have the company.

457
00:41:28,728 --> 00:41:33,608
- Dear Donna, people around
here sure are strange.

458
00:41:37,445 --> 00:41:39,531
Death and dying may be
Henry's occupation

459
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:42,826
but in this town it seems to be
everyone's preoccupation.

460
00:41:55,755 --> 00:41:56,381
Hello?

461
00:41:59,467 --> 00:42:00,301
Hello?

462
00:42:06,725 --> 00:42:08,852
Oh, good morning, Nora.

463
00:42:09,185 --> 00:42:10,395
Nice of you to drop by.

464
00:42:11,771 --> 00:42:14,315
A fellow book lover is
always welcome,

465
00:42:14,649 --> 00:42:16,234
especially in this town.

466
00:42:17,819 --> 00:42:20,280
How is that new spouse of yours?

467
00:42:21,448 --> 00:42:22,949
Fine, thank you.

468
00:42:23,283 --> 00:42:25,994
- Are you going to the services
for the Matthews girl?

469
00:42:27,036 --> 00:42:28,163
Oh, I don't know.

470
00:42:28,496 --> 00:42:29,289
I don't think so.

471
00:42:34,335 --> 00:42:36,463
- Everyone's going to be there,
you know.

472
00:42:36,796 --> 00:42:39,174
But that's how it is in
a small town.

473
00:42:39,507 --> 00:42:42,510
Everybody knows
everybody's business.

474
00:42:44,053 --> 00:42:46,347
I, myself, have been a friend of
the Matthews family

475
00:42:46,681 --> 00:42:48,516
for a long time.

476
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:50,935
Used to check out the
Nancy Drew mysteries

477
00:42:51,269 --> 00:42:52,729
for that poor child myself.

478
00:42:54,731 --> 00:42:56,232
And what can I get for you?

479
00:42:57,942 --> 00:42:59,778
- I'd just like to browse around,
if that's okay.

480
00:43:00,111 --> 00:43:01,863
You go right ahead, my dear.

481
00:43:06,117 --> 00:43:10,997
- Sexuality, Abnormal
Sexual Practices.

482
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:12,624
Hm, maybe this is it.

483
00:44:03,591 --> 00:44:05,468
The world is full of people

484
00:44:05,802 --> 00:44:08,638
with peculiar tastes in
their sexual appetites

485
00:44:08,972 --> 00:44:10,515
and behaviors.

486
00:44:10,849 --> 00:44:12,517
Tell me about it.

487
00:44:12,851 --> 00:44:16,771
Carnal, carnival, and yes,
even carnivorous

488
00:44:17,105 --> 00:44:20,316
sexual practices have
been reported.

489
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:22,360
There are even people
whose bizarre tastes

490
00:44:22,694 --> 00:44:24,320
run towards sexual acts including

491
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:27,490
intercourse with the dead.

492
00:44:34,455 --> 00:44:38,001
- Oh, didn't figure you for
the science type.

493
00:44:38,334 --> 00:44:40,545
Everything's okay between
you and Henry?

494
00:44:40,879 --> 00:44:42,589
Oh, everything's fine.

495
00:44:42,922 --> 00:44:44,924
- Well, I thought you might
like some of these,

496
00:44:45,258 --> 00:44:47,260
a couple of romances, a mystery,

497
00:44:47,594 --> 00:44:49,971
and a Stephen King to get
your blood going.

498
00:44:50,305 --> 00:44:52,265
I've already checked
them out for you

499
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:54,434
and your library card is tucked

500
00:44:54,767 --> 00:44:58,646
into the first good sex scene in
that romance novel.

501
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:01,608
Thank you.

502
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:12,660
See you at the funeral.

503
00:45:48,529 --> 00:45:51,366
Death is always a tragedy.

504
00:45:53,576 --> 00:45:54,953
And the death of a young person,

505
00:45:56,704 --> 00:46:01,501
this young person, this
beautiful wisp of a child

506
00:46:07,548 --> 00:46:09,008
is especially tragic
to those of us

507
00:46:09,342 --> 00:46:10,051
who knew her well.

508
00:46:14,555 --> 00:46:16,808
There's nothing we can do now,

509
00:46:18,351 --> 00:46:19,978
nothing we can say to
call her back,

510
00:46:21,771 --> 00:46:24,691
nothing we can do to
assuage the pain,

511
00:46:35,493 --> 00:46:36,577
nothing we can do now,

512
00:46:38,121 --> 00:46:39,831
nothing we can say to
bring her back

513
00:46:41,791 --> 00:46:44,585
from the eternal slumber in
God's special place.

514
00:46:48,673 --> 00:46:49,716
But know you this,

515
00:46:51,968 --> 00:46:53,761
she is going to a sweeter rest

516
00:46:54,762 --> 00:46:55,972
than we shall ever know,

517
00:46:57,849 --> 00:47:02,270
a rest untainted by the
pain of mortal life,

518
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:06,607
a rest so pure and sweet-

519
00:47:06,941 --> 00:47:08,818
This is taking an eternity.

520
00:47:09,152 --> 00:47:10,319
Shh.

521
00:47:10,653 --> 00:47:12,864
Wanted her at his side.

522
00:47:15,783 --> 00:47:17,118
God bless her soul.

523
00:47:19,787 --> 00:47:20,413
Amen.

524
00:47:44,562 --> 00:47:45,229
<i>_ No!</i>

525
00:47:46,314 --> 00:47:47,315
Please!

526
00:47:47,648 --> 00:47:49,817
Let me see her once more before...

527
00:47:51,277 --> 00:47:52,820
- Now, now- - Please,
you have to!

528
00:47:53,154 --> 00:47:55,406
Son, it's too late for that.

529
00:47:57,450 --> 00:47:59,410
What is, is.

530
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:01,662
Be a man.

531
00:48:01,996 --> 00:48:04,749
You know your sister would
want it that way.

532
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:30,233
- His hand reached slowly
and deliberately

533
00:48:30,566 --> 00:48:32,693
for the milky whiteness
of her throat.

534
00:48:33,736 --> 00:48:34,779
She tried to push him back,

535
00:48:35,113 --> 00:48:36,572
but his fingers...

536
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:46,249
Henry?

537
00:48:48,042 --> 00:48:48,709
Is that you?

538
00:48:51,629 --> 00:48:52,380
Hello?

539
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:54,465
Is anyone here?

540
00:49:38,843 --> 00:49:42,346
Evan, have you
been following me?

541
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:43,222
No.

542
00:49:44,807 --> 00:49:45,641
Yes.

543
00:49:45,975 --> 00:49:46,851
Please don't be afraid of me,

544
00:49:47,185 --> 00:49:49,437
but I had to talk to you alone.

545
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:51,355
I'm sorry about your sister,

546
00:49:51,689 --> 00:49:53,566
but there's really
nothing more I can do.

547
00:49:54,901 --> 00:49:56,694
- Please! - Let go,
you're hurting me.

548
00:49:57,028 --> 00:49:58,196
You have to hear me out.

549
00:49:59,488 --> 00:50:01,032
You're the only one I
can trust now,

550
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:05,077
and if I'm right, I may be the
only one you can trust.

551
00:50:05,411 --> 00:50:06,120
What do you mean?

552
00:50:07,622 --> 00:50:08,956
Do you wanna come up to the house?

553
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:10,374
No.

554
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:11,709
We can't be seen together.

555
00:50:12,043 --> 00:50:13,336
They suspect me already.

556
00:50:13,669 --> 00:50:14,962
Please, just come with
me for a moment.

557
00:50:15,296 --> 00:50:16,297
We don't have much time.

558
00:50:19,592 --> 00:50:20,676
What I have to tell you

559
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:23,846
involves practices so deviant,
so bizarre,

560
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:25,681
so against nature that
if I can't prove

561
00:50:26,015 --> 00:50:26,724
that what I'm saying is true,

562
00:50:27,058 --> 00:50:28,684
you'll think I'm insane for
even suggesting it

563
00:50:29,018 --> 00:50:31,103
because it involves your husband.

564
00:50:32,688 --> 00:50:35,358
Have you seen anything strange
around the mortuary?

565
00:50:35,691 --> 00:50:37,818
- I don't have any idea what
you're talking about.

566
00:50:40,988 --> 00:50:42,698
No, I can't tell you,

567
00:50:43,032 --> 00:50:44,992
but if you'll meet me
tonight at midnight,

568
00:50:45,326 --> 00:50:46,577
I'll show you.

569
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,662
Be ready when I come for you.

570
00:50:47,995 --> 00:50:49,664
And whatever you do, don't let him

571
00:50:49,997 --> 00:50:51,082
get you near the water.

572
00:51:25,616 --> 00:51:26,867
Where have you been?

573
00:51:27,201 --> 00:51:28,577
Just out walking.

574
00:51:28,911 --> 00:51:32,123
I was thinking about poor
Evan Matthews.

575
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:36,752
Shame.

576
00:51:37,086 --> 00:51:38,087
Some people have a harder
time letting go

577
00:51:38,421 --> 00:51:38,921
than others.

578
00:51:40,131 --> 00:51:42,466
Do you mind if I go into town?

579
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,136
I'd like to speak to
Reverend Collins.

580
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:46,095
Not at all.

581
00:51:46,429 --> 00:51:47,513
Morley will give you a lift.

582
00:51:58,024 --> 00:51:58,858
Reverend Collins?

583
00:52:01,902 --> 00:52:03,112
Nora.

584
00:52:03,446 --> 00:52:05,698
What's troubling you so soon
after your wedding?

585
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:11,871
I saw something, something awful

586
00:52:13,164 --> 00:52:15,833
from a secret place at
the mortuary.

587
00:52:16,167 --> 00:52:17,460
At least, I think I saw it.

588
00:52:18,419 --> 00:52:19,420
What was it?

589
00:52:19,754 --> 00:52:20,504
What did you see?

590
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:24,425
They were doing something

591
00:52:24,759 --> 00:52:27,887
to that girl's body,
something perverse.

592
00:52:30,181 --> 00:52:31,682
I couldn't keep from watching.

593
00:52:33,017 --> 00:52:34,602
- But are you sure of
what you've seen?

594
00:52:35,978 --> 00:52:38,397
Is it possible that that
young girl's death

595
00:52:38,731 --> 00:52:41,650
touched you in some way beyond
your understanding?

596
00:52:42,985 --> 00:52:45,029
Did perhaps maybe you only thought

597
00:52:45,363 --> 00:52:47,948
you saw something that
really didn't happen?

598
00:52:49,742 --> 00:52:53,204
- Yeah, Father, I think
maybe you're right.

599
00:52:53,537 --> 00:52:55,790
I don't really know what I saw.

600
00:52:56,123 --> 00:52:57,875
It may have just been the shock.

601
00:52:58,209 --> 00:52:59,794
Maybe I was just a little confused

602
00:53:00,127 --> 00:53:01,962
and this was just a
waste of your time.

603
00:53:02,296 --> 00:53:03,172
Thank you. - Nora.

604
00:53:03,506 --> 00:53:04,882
Nora, wait, please.

605
00:53:16,977 --> 00:53:18,938
Hello, Reverend Collins.

606
00:53:20,272 --> 00:53:21,774
She did?

607
00:53:22,108 --> 00:53:22,650
She is?

608
00:53:23,984 --> 00:53:25,861
It must be the strain of her
new surroundings.

609
00:53:27,071 --> 00:53:27,988
Yes, I know.

610
00:53:28,322 --> 00:53:31,158
Thank you, Reverend Collins,
goodbye.

611
00:53:32,618 --> 00:53:33,911
Ah.

612
00:53:34,245 --> 00:53:36,205
This has been a trying day
for you, hasn't it?

613
00:53:39,125 --> 00:53:41,252
I know just the right
thing to relax you,

614
00:53:42,378 --> 00:53:43,963
a nice hot bath.

615
00:54:01,021 --> 00:54:01,564
I'm in here.

616
00:54:05,484 --> 00:54:06,152
I know.

617
00:54:12,074 --> 00:54:14,869
I came to wash your back.

618
00:54:15,202 --> 00:54:17,872
- No, please, don't
trouble yourself.

619
00:54:18,205 --> 00:54:19,957
It's no trouble.

620
00:54:20,291 --> 00:54:21,417
No trouble at all.

621
00:54:28,215 --> 00:54:30,801
Reverend Collins was right,
you are tense.

622
00:54:31,135 --> 00:54:31,677
Yeah.

623
00:54:45,691 --> 00:54:46,233
Relax.

624
00:55:26,232 --> 00:55:29,235
What are you trying to do to me?

625
00:55:29,568 --> 00:55:32,196
I'm sorry, my foot slipped.

626
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:33,906
I almost fell in.

627
00:55:37,159 --> 00:55:39,203
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

628
00:55:39,537 --> 00:55:40,287
I'm sorry.

629
00:56:21,161 --> 00:56:21,829
Evan?

630
00:56:27,042 --> 00:56:27,710
Evan?

631
00:56:32,506 --> 00:56:34,174
It's me, it's Evan, it's okay.

632
00:56:34,508 --> 00:56:35,843
Please hurry, we don't
have much time.

633
00:56:36,176 --> 00:56:37,386
My car's over here.

634
00:57:40,032 --> 00:57:41,075
I must be out of my mind

635
00:57:41,408 --> 00:57:44,203
to be here with you in the
middle of the night.

636
00:57:44,536 --> 00:57:46,664
- I promise you won't think so
after you see this.

637
00:57:50,292 --> 00:57:53,545
- Harriet Anna Cox, beloved
wife of John Henry,

638
00:57:53,879 --> 00:57:56,799
born 1965, died 1985.

639
00:57:57,841 --> 00:58:00,010
It's his first wife's tombstone.

640
00:58:00,344 --> 00:58:02,012
I knew he was widower.

641
00:58:03,305 --> 00:58:07,226
- Maxine Ina Cox, beloved
wife of John Henry Cox,

642
00:58:07,559 --> 00:58:11,397
born 1964, died February 18th,

643
00:58:11,730 --> 00:58:14,233
- But I didn't know he was
a widower twice.

644
00:58:15,275 --> 00:58:17,611
Anyway, what does that prove?

645
00:58:17,945 --> 00:58:19,363
What year were you born?

646
00:58:19,697 --> 00:58:21,240
1964.

647
00:58:23,242 --> 00:58:24,993
- That makes you the
same age as them.

648
00:58:26,245 --> 00:58:28,956
- So, maybe he likes
younger women.

649
00:58:30,582 --> 00:58:31,667
- Come on, we don't
have much time.

650
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,502
We've gotta find my
sister's casket.

651
00:58:41,135 --> 00:58:41,885
Here it is.

652
00:58:43,512 --> 00:58:47,224
- You're not actually gonna
break in there, are you?

653
00:58:47,558 --> 00:58:49,351
- The only way you'll
begin to believe me

654
00:58:50,811 --> 00:58:52,813
is when I show you what's inside
my sister's casket.

655
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:13,792
Nora, help me!

656
00:59:14,126 --> 00:59:15,461
Oh, this is grotesque!

657
00:59:15,794 --> 00:59:17,713
If I don't stop, you're
gonna be staring

658
00:59:18,046 --> 00:59:19,882
at your sister's corpse in
about 30 seconds.

659
00:59:20,215 --> 00:59:20,758
Don't you understand?

660
00:59:21,091 --> 00:59:22,509
They're grave robbers!

661
00:59:22,843 --> 00:59:24,011
Grave robbers?

662
00:59:31,518 --> 00:59:32,102
Empty-

663
00:59:32,436 --> 00:59:33,353
I knew it!

664
00:59:33,687 --> 00:59:35,731
Those bastard grave robbers
have taken her body.

665
00:59:36,064 --> 00:59:36,690
What for?

666
00:59:38,358 --> 00:59:39,151
They do something to the body

667
00:59:39,485 --> 00:59:40,360
during the embalming.

668
00:59:42,404 --> 00:59:44,323
Please believe me now.

669
00:59:44,656 --> 00:59:46,700
It's the only thing that
will save you.

670
00:59:47,034 --> 00:59:47,493
What do you mean, me?

671
00:59:47,826 --> 00:59:48,911
Nora, listen.

672
00:59:49,244 --> 00:59:51,413
The bodies they steal
don't last forever.

673
00:59:51,747 --> 00:59:53,832
They always need a fresh supply.

674
00:59:54,166 --> 00:59:55,292
This can't be happening.

675
00:59:55,626 --> 00:59:57,586
- Henry married you
because they mean

676
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:58,921
for you to be next.

677
00:59:59,254 --> 01:00:00,172
And what they'll do to your body

678
01:00:00,506 --> 01:00:02,925
after you're dead is the
ultimate nightmare.

679
01:00:03,258 --> 01:00:04,092
You mean they...

680
01:00:05,761 --> 01:00:06,428
Oh my God!

681
01:00:08,055 --> 01:00:09,139
Oh my God!

682
01:00:09,473 --> 01:00:10,349
Yes.

683
01:00:12,017 --> 01:00:13,101
And Henry's not in this alone.

684
01:00:13,435 --> 01:00:14,019
There are others.

685
01:00:15,395 --> 01:00:16,522
I'm not sure how many.

686
01:00:16,855 --> 01:00:17,981
Maybe the whole town.

687
01:00:19,358 --> 01:00:22,444
I'm not sure who we can trust
except each other.

688
01:00:24,696 --> 01:00:25,364
Come on.

689
01:00:31,745 --> 01:00:34,748
Promise me if anything
happens to me

690
01:00:35,082 --> 01:00:38,085
you'll make sure they're exposed,
and finish this.

691
01:00:39,461 --> 01:00:40,546
I promise.

692
01:00:47,719 --> 01:00:49,304
I don't think we're alone.

693
01:00:49,638 --> 01:00:50,389
Who's there?

694
01:00:52,474 --> 01:00:54,726
What do you want from us?

695
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:55,561
Run, run!

696
01:00:57,729 --> 01:00:58,897
Come on.

697
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:19,293
Oh my God, they're killing him!

698
01:02:52,803 --> 01:02:55,055
- Promise me if
anything happens to me

699
01:02:55,389 --> 01:02:59,559
you'll make sure they're exposed,
and finish this.

700
01:02:59,893 --> 01:03:02,646
Promise me, promise me,
promise me.

701
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:04,773
I promise.

702
01:03:23,667 --> 01:03:26,253
- God, where the hell
have you been?

703
01:03:26,586 --> 01:03:27,421
Well, thank goodness
you're all right.

704
01:03:27,754 --> 01:03:28,422
I woke up, I found you gone.

705
01:03:28,755 --> 01:03:29,923
I thought you'd run away.

706
01:03:30,257 --> 01:03:31,800
I thought something horrible
had happened to you.

707
01:03:32,134 --> 01:03:35,262
- I just went for a drive,
that's all.

708
01:03:35,595 --> 01:03:36,388
Nora, wait.

709
01:03:36,722 --> 01:03:37,472
Tell me what's going on.

710
01:03:37,806 --> 01:03:40,350
- I went to the
graveyard with Evan.

711
01:03:40,684 --> 01:03:42,769
I saw their tombstones, Henry.

712
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:43,687
I saw mine.

713
01:03:44,646 --> 01:03:46,064
We opened up her casket

714
01:03:46,398 --> 01:03:47,357
and there was no body.

715
01:03:47,691 --> 01:03:49,901
And then I think they killed Evan.

716
01:03:51,111 --> 01:03:52,571
I know what I saw.

717
01:03:52,904 --> 01:03:54,656
What do you do in that room,
Henry?

718
01:03:54,990 --> 01:03:56,241
What do you do with the bodies?

719
01:03:56,575 --> 01:03:57,159
I'll show you.

720
01:04:00,078 --> 01:04:00,787
I'll show you.

721
01:04:01,121 --> 01:04:02,539
You can see for yourself.

722
01:04:02,873 --> 01:04:03,749
I thought I would spare you

723
01:04:04,082 --> 01:04:05,417
from the ugly side of my life,

724
01:04:05,751 --> 01:04:07,878
but you want to see- - No,
let me go!

725
01:04:08,211 --> 01:04:10,297
Please, I don't wanna see anymore.

726
01:04:10,630 --> 01:04:12,507
See for yourself, go ahead.

727
01:04:12,841 --> 01:04:13,425
<i>_ No!</i>

728
01:04:13,759 --> 01:04:15,177
Go ahead and see for yourself.

729
01:04:29,566 --> 01:04:30,650
Stop!

730
01:04:30,984 --> 01:04:32,694
In the name of love, stop.

731
01:04:52,964 --> 01:04:53,757
What is the matter with you,
woman?

732
01:04:54,091 --> 01:04:55,717
Can't you see that I love you?

733
01:04:56,051 --> 01:04:56,635
Evan is dead!

734
01:04:56,968 --> 01:04:57,677
They killed him!

735
01:04:58,011 --> 01:04:58,762
And what about Morley?

736
01:04:59,096 --> 01:05:00,555
I saw Evan cut his head off.

737
01:05:04,476 --> 01:05:05,393
You called, madame?

738
01:05:18,907 --> 01:05:20,367
She's coming around now.

739
01:05:46,643 --> 01:05:49,813
Listen, Nora, they're
playing our song.

740
01:05:53,066 --> 01:05:54,818
No, please don't, no!

741
01:06:01,199 --> 01:06:02,868
You don't want me.

742
01:06:03,201 --> 01:06:04,452
I'm not dead yet.

743
01:06:07,414 --> 01:06:08,957
I'm not dead yet!

744
01:07:01,968 --> 01:07:02,636
Honey?

745
01:07:04,638 --> 01:07:05,472
I heard you scream.

746
01:07:07,224 --> 01:07:08,683
Are you all right?

747
01:07:09,017 --> 01:07:10,435
Did you have another bad dream?

748
01:07:11,811 --> 01:07:14,606
- If you love me, you'll take
me to the Sheriff.

749
01:07:18,944 --> 01:07:20,195
Morning, Sheriff.

750
01:07:20,528 --> 01:07:22,239
Nora and I need a
moment of your time.

751
01:07:30,956 --> 01:07:32,415
Well hello, Evan Matthews.

752
01:07:32,749 --> 01:07:35,126
Yes, Sheriff Potter. - Evan, Evan?

753
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:36,795
Could you come by the office

754
01:07:37,128 --> 01:07:38,672
on your way to town today?

755
01:07:39,673 --> 01:07:41,174
You see, dear, I told you

756
01:07:41,508 --> 01:07:42,884
there was nothing to worry about.

757
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:47,806
Now I understand.

758
01:07:48,139 --> 01:07:49,099
You wouldn't let me speak to him

759
01:07:49,432 --> 01:07:51,101
because he wasn't there.

760
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:54,062
Everything Evan told me is true.

761
01:07:54,396 --> 01:07:58,817
You, Henry, Morley, Ms.
Strickland,

762
01:07:59,150 --> 01:08:00,735
you've got your own little club.

763
01:08:01,069 --> 01:08:03,154
You're all in this together,
aren't you?

764
01:08:03,488 --> 01:08:04,781
How sick!

765
01:08:05,115 --> 01:08:07,325
How twisted and perverse!

766
01:08:07,659 --> 01:08:08,785
How could you?

767
01:08:11,204 --> 01:08:14,165
- Little lady, I think
you've been out

768
01:08:14,499 --> 01:08:17,419
in the sun a little too long.

769
01:08:17,752 --> 01:08:22,507
Accusing us of doing things
with dead bodies,

770
01:08:23,967 --> 01:08:26,803
sounds like somethin' out of the
National Enquirer,

771
01:08:27,137 --> 01:08:31,308
only nobody'd believe ya in
a million years.

772
01:08:31,641 --> 01:08:34,060
And nobody'd take the word

773
01:08:34,394 --> 01:08:39,149
of a common prostitute, a New
York City streetwalker

774
01:08:41,901 --> 01:08:43,278
OVGI" OUTS.

775
01:08:43,611 --> 01:08:46,865
- How could you
possibly know that?

776
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:48,116
I changed my name.

777
01:08:49,492 --> 01:08:50,285
I started over.

778
01:08:50,618 --> 01:08:51,745
It's all in the past.

779
01:08:52,078 --> 01:08:53,913
I've got a clean slate now.

780
01:08:54,247 --> 01:08:55,040
How did you find that out?

781
01:08:55,373 --> 01:08:58,418
- Just ran a check of
your fingerprints.

782
01:08:59,753 --> 01:09:04,132
Seems you've got a rap sheet
three pages long.

783
01:09:05,091 --> 01:09:06,968
You're a convicted prostitute

784
01:09:08,094 --> 01:09:12,057
and you did jail time too,
didn't ya?

785
01:09:12,390 --> 01:09:14,184
No, that's all in the past!

786
01:09:14,517 --> 01:09:16,770
I started over, I have a new life.

787
01:09:17,103 --> 01:09:18,730
There, there, Nora, Nora.

788
01:09:19,064 --> 01:09:20,774
Your past is forgiven.

789
01:09:21,107 --> 01:09:23,818
Your place is with us now
forever and ever.

790
01:09:24,152 --> 01:09:26,488
And no one will ever miss you.

791
01:09:46,091 --> 01:09:48,927
- Reverend Collins,
they're after me.

792
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:49,969
You've gotta help me.

793
01:09:50,303 --> 01:09:51,763
Who's after you?

794
01:09:52,097 --> 01:09:53,765
Stay back, stay away.

795
01:09:54,099 --> 01:09:54,849
Let me take care of her.

796
01:09:56,142 --> 01:09:57,143
Nora, Nora, wait.

797
01:10:01,147 --> 01:10:02,524
Nora, wait, you're safe here.

798
01:10:02,857 --> 01:10:04,109
There's nothing to be afraid of.

799
01:10:06,403 --> 01:10:08,696
I tell you there's nothing
to be afraid of.

800
01:10:09,030 --> 01:10:10,865
For God's sake, you've
got to believe me!

801
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:12,659
- You're in on it,
aren't you?

802
01:10:12,992 --> 01:10:14,160
You're part of it.

803
01:10:14,494 --> 01:10:16,704
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

804
01:10:17,038 --> 01:10:18,873
Please, let me help you

805
01:10:19,207 --> 01:10:20,917
before it's too late.

806
01:10:24,754 --> 01:10:27,757
Nora, Nora please,
don't run from me.

807
01:10:28,883 --> 01:10:29,551
Nora.

808
01:10:33,805 --> 01:10:34,389
Stop it!

809
01:10:34,722 --> 01:10:35,682
Talk to me.

810
01:10:36,015 --> 01:10:36,558
Nora.

811
01:10:43,231 --> 01:10:45,191
Stop, just stop for a minute.

812
01:10:45,525 --> 01:10:46,025
Nora.

813
01:10:47,402 --> 01:10:49,904
Nora please, just talk to me.

814
01:10:50,238 --> 01:10:51,573
Nora, Nora please!

815
01:10:56,911 --> 01:10:58,621
ahuds)

816
01:11:12,177 --> 01:11:13,553
Let me go!

817
01:11:13,887 --> 01:11:15,930
You can't help, any of you.

818
01:11:25,690 --> 01:11:27,442
Please, let me in!

819
01:11:29,736 --> 01:11:31,321
Never open when you need one.

820
01:11:35,533 --> 01:11:38,578
Hello Operator, I need to
make a collect call.

821
01:11:45,293 --> 01:11:46,961
I haven't got much time.

822
01:11:47,295 --> 01:11:48,338
I'm in a town called Newbury.

823
01:11:48,671 --> 01:11:50,965
It's about 100 miles north
of the interstate.

824
01:11:51,299 --> 01:11:52,467
Come as quick as you can, Donna.

825
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:55,053
They're trying to kill me!
- I'm on my way.

826
01:11:56,429 --> 01:11:58,431
- I'll be in a place called
Cox's Funeral Home.

827
01:11:58,765 --> 01:11:59,766
Just pull up and beep.

828
01:12:00,099 --> 01:12:02,101
And whatever you do, don't
talk to anybody.

829
01:12:02,435 --> 01:12:03,686
Don't tell them why you're here.

830
01:12:06,648 --> 01:12:08,483
Honey, are you there?

831
01:12:08,816 --> 01:12:10,151
Can you hear me?

832
01:12:10,485 --> 01:12:11,528
Oh, honey!

833
01:12:20,537 --> 01:12:21,120
God, they're after me.

834
01:12:21,454 --> 01:12:22,747
Don't let them get me.

835
01:12:23,081 --> 01:12:23,998
Duck in here, honey.

836
01:12:24,332 --> 01:12:25,291
We'll save you.

837
01:12:32,423 --> 01:12:34,342
She's in here, everybody.

838
01:12:34,676 --> 01:12:35,468
Let's get her.

839
01:12:41,432 --> 01:12:43,309
There she goes! - Come on!

840
01:15:39,527 --> 01:15:40,194
Come back, my dear.

841
01:15:41,696 --> 01:15:44,240
There is nothing to be afraid of.

842
01:15:48,035 --> 01:15:49,620
Here's your goddamn ring back.

843
01:15:51,247 --> 01:15:52,999
Something to add to the
family jewels.

844
01:16:20,067 --> 01:16:21,986
Nora, please let me in.

845
01:16:53,434 --> 01:16:55,603
Did you meet my first wife?

846
01:16:59,315 --> 01:17:02,235
Oh, God!

847
01:17:08,533 --> 01:17:11,619
My second wife.

848
01:17:11,953 --> 01:17:13,287
I loved her so much.

849
01:17:35,643 --> 01:17:37,395
I wanted to make you mine,

850
01:17:37,728 --> 01:17:40,356
but all you wanted to be was
homecoming queen.

851
01:17:46,362 --> 01:17:47,238
<i>Dad, Stamps,</i>

852
01:17:49,031 --> 01:17:52,577
I'm trying to keep the
family business alive.

853
01:17:57,957 --> 01:18:01,335
Would you like to meet the
rest of my family?

854
01:18:02,545 --> 01:18:04,297
Get away from me!

855
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:12,263
Get off of me!

856
01:18:25,610 --> 01:18:27,278
Morley!

857
01:18:27,612 --> 01:18:29,196
Stop her, after her.

858
01:18:29,530 --> 01:18:31,198
Don't let her get away.

859
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:43,753
- Nora Mae Edwards Cox, this
could be your lucky day

860
01:18:44,086 --> 01:18:45,588
because one of these keys
starts the engine

861
01:18:45,922 --> 01:18:49,342
of this beautiful 1982
Buick Electra hearse.

862
01:18:50,635 --> 01:18:52,386
0K3)'-

863
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:54,347
Come on.

864
01:19:01,604 --> 01:19:02,563
<i>Esme, meeme.</i>

865
01:19:10,154 --> 01:19:13,908
Thank God, a domestic V8.

866
01:19:21,123 --> 01:19:21,791
Nora.

867
01:19:23,751 --> 01:19:24,418
Nora!

868
01:19:37,515 --> 01:19:38,182
Nora!

869
01:19:40,977 --> 01:19:41,644
Nora!

870
01:20:08,629 --> 01:20:09,880
- Hey kids,
it's your old buddy

871
01:20:10,214 --> 01:20:11,966
the night owl back with much
more of the music

872
01:20:12,299 --> 01:20:13,092
you wanna hear.

873
01:20:13,426 --> 01:20:15,428
This little valentine's
in dedication

874
01:20:15,761 --> 01:20:16,762
to the woman I love.

875
01:20:17,096 --> 01:20:18,431
It's from Henry and goes out

876
01:20:18,764 --> 01:20:20,975
to a little lady named Nora.

877
01:20:58,345 --> 01:20:59,597
Nora!

878
01:21:47,144 --> 01:21:49,688
- Excuse me, sir, could
you please tell me

879
01:21:50,022 --> 01:21:51,565
how I can get to the
Cox Funeral Home?

880
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:58,114
- Well, little lady, I'll
tell you what you do.

881
01:22:17,133 --> 01:22:19,927
- No more one-night
stands in hell!

882
01:22:38,654 --> 01:22:40,447
If I ever get outta this alive,

883
01:22:40,781 --> 01:22:41,740
I'm never gonna let the
sight of blood

884
01:22:42,074 --> 01:22:43,117
make me sick again.

885
01:22:52,042 --> 01:22:52,918
Prepare to meet your maker,

886
01:22:53,252 --> 01:22:55,504
you bald headed son of a bitch!

887
01:22:57,590 --> 01:22:59,216
Oh, oh, oh, oh shit!

888
01:23:59,985 --> 01:24:01,278
Nora, stop it, for God sakes.

889
01:24:01,612 --> 01:24:02,571
It's me!

890
01:24:02,905 --> 01:24:03,697
Evan!

891
01:24:04,031 --> 01:24:04,865
They said you were alive.

892
01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:06,325
I thought you were dead.
- I thought-

893
01:24:06,659 --> 01:24:08,369
I didn't know what to believe.

894
01:24:08,702 --> 01:24:10,371
- I thought I was going to die,
too.

895
01:24:10,704 --> 01:24:11,830
I don't even know how I
got in the casket.

896
01:24:12,164 --> 01:24:12,873
It doesn't matter now.

897
01:24:13,207 --> 01:24:15,125
Come on, let's get outta
here together.

898
01:24:15,459 --> 01:24:16,585
You better let me drive.

899
01:24:34,270 --> 01:24:35,729
Oh my God!

900
01:24:36,063 --> 01:24:37,189
What are you doing, Evan?

901
01:24:37,523 --> 01:24:39,692
Evan, speed up, run the roadblock!

902
01:24:40,025 --> 01:24:41,360
Why would I want to do that?

903
01:24:41,694 --> 01:24:43,153
We're not going anywhere.

904
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:45,739
You bastard!

905
01:24:46,073 --> 01:24:47,241
How could you?

906
01:24:47,574 --> 01:24:48,450
It's simple, really.

907
01:24:49,576 --> 01:24:50,786
I always loved my sister,

908
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:51,829
always wanted her in a way

909
01:24:52,162 --> 01:24:54,331
that society would never
have accepted.

910
01:24:54,665 --> 01:24:55,708
But after she died, Henry let me

911
01:24:56,041 --> 01:24:57,960
do everything I always
wanted to do.

912
01:24:59,044 --> 01:25:00,587
And soon, it'll be your turn.

913
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:27,865
Donna, Donna thank God it's you!

914
01:25:28,198 --> 01:25:30,326
Same nightmare again, hon?

915
01:25:49,261 --> 01:25:49,928
Stop!

916
01:25:53,390 --> 01:25:55,309
- You know, Nora, you
should've listened

917
01:25:55,642 --> 01:25:56,435
to Reverend Collins.

918
01:25:56,769 --> 01:25:58,103
He wasn't one of us.

919
01:25:58,437 --> 01:25:59,855
He was probably the only person

920
01:26:00,189 --> 01:26:03,400
who could save you, and you
killed him.

921
01:26:05,069 --> 01:26:06,779
Please, let me out!

922
01:26:21,919 --> 01:26:22,711
No!

923
01:26:23,045 --> 01:26:23,754
No!

924
01:26:24,088 --> 01:26:24,630
No!

925
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:51,865
I figured you were tired.

926
01:26:52,199 --> 01:26:52,908
We haven't been that busy.

927
01:26:53,242 --> 01:26:54,785
I just let you sleep.

928
01:26:55,119 --> 01:26:56,662
Here, drink up.

929
01:27:21,645 --> 01:27:22,563
Nightmares are one thing,

930
01:27:22,896 --> 01:27:24,940
but real life is something else.

931
01:27:53,385 --> 01:27:54,970
- Nora
Mae Edwards Cox

932
01:27:55,304 --> 01:27:56,930
got off on self defense.

933
01:27:57,264 --> 01:27:58,098
She's writing her memoirs

934
01:27:58,432 --> 01:28:00,350
and living in Woodstock, New York.

935
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:04,938
John Henry Cox survived the
diner shooting.

936
01:28:05,272 --> 01:28:07,441
He's currently keeping the
family business alive

937
01:28:07,774 --> 01:28:09,318
and has recently remarried.

938
01:28:10,736 --> 01:28:12,404
Jack, the condom salesman,

939
01:28:12,738 --> 01:28:15,073
was his company's top
grossing sales achiever.

940
01:28:15,407 --> 01:28:17,242
He was awarded a big bonus

941
01:28:17,576 --> 01:28:19,870
and lost it all in the
stock market.

942
01:28:20,204 --> 01:28:22,956
Ma still runs the friendliest
little cafe in Newbury,

943
01:28:23,290 --> 01:28:24,333
or anyplace else.

944
01:28:24,666 --> 01:28:25,834
She's currently writing a book

945
01:28:26,168 --> 01:28:27,794
of her favorite secret recipes

946
01:28:28,128 --> 01:28:30,631
and has already sold the
screen rights.

947
01:28:30,964 --> 01:28:32,132
Emmaline Strickland fell ill

948
01:28:32,466 --> 01:28:33,967
after getting a bad shock

949
01:28:34,301 --> 01:28:36,553
and is resting quietly
in seclusion.

950
01:28:37,930 --> 01:28:40,432
Jimmy the dishwasher quit
his job at Ma's

951
01:28:40,766 --> 01:28:43,352
to become a Neopop violence
performance artist.

952
01:28:43,685 --> 01:28:46,897
He currently resides in a loft in
SoHo, New York City.

953
01:28:47,231 --> 01:28:48,357
Evan Matthews works part time

954
01:28:48,690 --> 01:28:49,942
for the Cox Funeral Home

955
01:28:50,275 --> 01:28:52,861
and is in his second semester
of mortuary school.

956
01:28:54,321 --> 01:28:56,448
Sheriff Porter Potter
continues to uphold

957
01:28:56,782 --> 01:28:58,242
the traditional values of Newbury.

958
01:28:58,575 --> 01:29:00,661
Cicely Matthews is still dead.

959
01:29:00,994 --> 01:29:03,830
Reverend Collins took a leave of
absence from his church.

960
01:29:04,164 --> 01:29:05,791
He is repeating a sky
diving course

961
01:29:06,124 --> 01:29:08,126
that he recently flunked
at night school.

962
01:29:09,253 --> 01:29:11,922
Larry and Ed are on call
24-hours a day

963
01:29:12,256 --> 01:29:13,632
just in case you need them.

964
01:29:19,346 --> 01:29:20,806
As for the young gossip,

965
01:29:21,139 --> 01:29:23,141
she finally met the man
of her dreams

966
01:29:23,475 --> 01:29:25,018
and the rest is history.

967
01:29:26,353 --> 01:29:27,854
Yep, she married the undertaker.

968
01:29:30,524 --> 01:29:31,858
- The
people of Newbury

969
01:29:32,192 --> 01:29:34,695
want you to know you're
always welcome anytime.

970
01:29:36,363 --> 01:29:39,074
Morley Leslie did not die in the
diner shooting either.

971
01:29:39,408 --> 01:29:40,742
Through a miraculous operation,

972
01:29:41,076 --> 01:29:42,703
Henry brought him back to life.

973
01:29:43,036 --> 01:29:44,288
He walks among us still.

974
01:29:45,330 --> 01:29:47,207
# I don't sleep with strangers

975
01:29:47,541 --> 01:29:49,751
# I'm not that kind of girl

976
01:29:50,085 --> 01:29:51,962
# Strangers are for dancing

977
01:29:52,296 --> 01:29:54,756
# Not chancing, romancing

978
01:29:55,090 --> 01:29:57,050
# I don't sleep with strangers

979
01:29:57,384 --> 01:29:59,094
# I'm careful from the start

980
01:29:59,428 --> 01:30:04,182
# I won't let a stranger
endanger my heart

981
01:30:06,810 --> 01:30:10,981
# I grew impatient with her game

982
01:30:11,315 --> 01:30:16,153
# I had an image she maintained

983
01:30:16,486 --> 01:30:19,948
# But as I turned to walk away

984
01:30:20,282 --> 01:30:22,117
# She took me by the hand

985
01:30:22,451 --> 01:30:25,245
# And asked if maybe I could stay

986
01:30:25,579 --> 01:30:26,997
# And as she drew me close

987
01:30:27,331 --> 01:30:29,666
# These were the words
I heard her say

988
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,960
# I don't sleep with strangers

989
01:30:32,294 --> 01:30:34,421
# I like to take my time

990
01:30:34,755 --> 01:30:36,882
# Patience is a virtue

991
01:30:37,215 --> 01:30:39,676
# won't hurt you

992
01:30:40,010 --> 01:30:42,012
# I don't sleep with strangers

993
01:30:42,346 --> 01:30:44,306
# I guess I'm just a square

994
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:46,516
# First you have to know me

995
01:30:46,850 --> 01:30:49,853
# And show me you care

996
01:31:10,499 --> 01:31:12,918
# I don't sleep with strangers

997
01:31:13,251 --> 01:31:15,420
# Although I like your style

998
01:31:15,754 --> 01:31:17,589
# If you treat me gently

999
01:31:17,923 --> 01:31:20,300
# You just might be friendly

1000
01:31:20,634 --> 01:31:22,678
# I don't sleep with strangers

1001
01:31:23,011 --> 01:31:25,097
# Although I like your smile

1002
01:31:25,430 --> 01:31:30,102
# Maybe we could stay here
and talk for a while

1003
01:31:30,435 --> 01:31:32,437
# I don't sleep with strangers

1004
01:31:32,771 --> 01:31:35,190
# Although I must confess

1005
01:31:35,524 --> 01:31:37,150
# It can be so thrilling

1006
01:31:37,484 --> 01:31:40,112
# When two hearts are willing

1007
01:31:40,445 --> 01:31:42,239
# I don't sleep with strangers

1008
01:31:42,572 --> 01:31:44,783
# Although I Will admit

1009
01:31:45,117 --> 01:31:47,077
# That there must be a first time

1010
01:31:47,411 --> 01:31:51,498
# And this may be it

1011
01:31:51,832 --> 01:31:55,961
# You are cruel and unusual to me

1012
01:31:56,294 --> 01:31:57,254
- This is
your old buddy

1013
01:31:57,587 --> 01:31:58,922
the night owl signing off.

1014
01:31:59,256 --> 01:32:00,215
Goodnight, kids.

1015
01:32:15,188 --> 01:32:18,817
# Caution is a stranger to you

1016
01:32:19,151 --> 01:32:22,487
# Wishful never described you

1017
01:32:22,821 --> 01:32:26,533
# Bravery has left me too

1018
01:32:26,867 --> 01:32:30,328
# Loving you has made me blue

1019
01:32:30,662 --> 01:32:34,166
# Sometimes you might
feel so strange

1020
01:32:34,499 --> 01:32:38,336
# You seem to think you
need a change

1021
01:32:38,670 --> 01:32:42,215
# Losing you will set me free

1022
01:32:42,549 --> 01:32:45,761
# I gave into indignity

1023
01:32:46,094 --> 01:32:50,140
# You are cruel and unusual to me
