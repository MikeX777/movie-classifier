1
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,520
- How you doin', Frank?
- Morning, Danny. It's a gorgeous day!

2
00:01:32,555 --> 00:01:34,560
Isn't it?

3
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,480
- Thank you.
- How are you, Clark?

4
00:01:36,515 --> 00:01:38,400
Good morning there, Danny.

5
00:01:38,435 --> 00:01:40,400
- There you go.
- Thank you.

6
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,000
- Morning, Danny.
- Hiya, Tom.

7
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,920
How's it going, Doc, Arty?

8
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,840
- Hi.
- Morning.

9
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,040
Oh, Danny, wait.

10
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,080
Here, wait, wait.

11
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,000
How you doing, Nick?

12
00:02:08,035 --> 00:02:10,200
Fine.

13
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,320
Give this to your mother.

14
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,240
Thanks.

15
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,840
- Good morning, Danny.
- Morning, Ma.

16
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:53,840
I told you not to hang you coat on
the banister. It ruins the shape.

17
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,760
- Sorry.
- Did you get my paper?

18
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,640
Thanks.

19
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,560
My lotto ticket?

20
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,200
- What's this?
- From Nick.

21
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,320
- Give it back.
- Why?

22
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,240
Come on, ma, Nick's a good guy.

23
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,440
Typical Greek.
I know what he's up to.

24
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,800
If I accept it, he'll think I'm easy.

25
00:03:23,835 --> 00:03:26,400
I don't want to know this.

26
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,920
What's that?

27
00:03:27,955 --> 00:03:31,000
Prime rib.

28
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,360
When did you start eating yogurt?
Where's your danish?

29
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,280
I'm trying to cut back.

30
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,200
You? Cut back?

31
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,120
Pants are getting a little tight,

32
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,040
so I thought I'd give this a try.

33
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,360
Well you can't expect
to fit into boys sizes.

34
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,520
You're not a boy anymore.

35
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm 38 years old, Ma.
I haven't been a boy for 20 years.

36
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,960
My son, the anorexic.

37
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Aw, damn, fisk isn't gonna play.

38
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,480
- You going to the game?
- Yeah, tomorrow.

39
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,040
Sal and me.
Boston's in town, Clemens is pitching.

40
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,520
- Should be a great game.
- But tomorrow's Wednesday.

41
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,440
- Yeah.
- And Wednesday we go to bingo.

42
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,960
Couldn't we skip it this week, Ma?

43
00:04:09,995 --> 00:04:14,000
Skip it, Danny?
I can't skip bingo, I love it.

44
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,600
I haven't skipped bingo in 25 years.

45
00:04:17,635 --> 00:04:19,960
Look, I'd cancel,
it's just, you know,

46
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,880
sal got these tickets
over three months ago.

47
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,920
Okay, I'll go myself.

48
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,560
Just be careful. There's a lot
of construction around the church...

49
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,480
and I don't want you
slipping and falling.

50
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,880
- I will.
- Your eyes aren't so good anymore.

51
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,800
Don't start that.

52
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,720
My eyes are perfect.

53
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,120
Then why are you pouring orange
juice in your coffee?

54
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,400
Damn cartons!

55
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,440
They're all decorated the same.

56
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,840
Oh, Danny.

57
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,400
I hope you enjoyed
your baseball game.

58
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,880
Um, Ma, look,

59
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,920
I'll skip the game.
We'll go to bingo.

60
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,280
No, that's all right.
You go ahead, enjoy yourself.

61
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,760
No, no, I can go
to a game any time, Ma.

62
00:06:00,795 --> 00:06:02,680
Bingo only comes once a week.

63
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,680
- Thank you, Danny.
- It's okay.

64
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,680
Are you gonna eat that?

65
00:06:09,715 --> 00:06:11,600
No, you want it?

66
00:06:11,635 --> 00:06:13,520
Yeah, I'll start
my diet tomorrow.

67
00:06:13,555 --> 00:06:15,400
That's sissy food, anyway.

68
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,800
True, very true.

69
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,280
The district court
of Salvatore Buonarte...

70
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,680
and Danny Muldoon
is now in session.

71
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,600
All rise.

72
00:06:29,635 --> 00:06:31,280
What's the accused
charged with?

73
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,880
Name's Duane Earl Tyrone.

74
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,920
Apparently he ran this piece
of shit apartment housing...

75
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,680
down on the south side, mostly
senior citizens, right?

76
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,440
He'd take their monthly checks,

77
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,120
cash 'em, then strangle
them to death.

78
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,360
- Aw, jeez.
- How come guys like that do that?

79
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,440
Chemical imbalance
or something, you know.

80
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,360
- Yeah?
- I read that somewhere.

81
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,760
- Not enough...
- You mean it's a vitamin thing?

82
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,680
Yeah, it's a deficiency
of some sort,

83
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,600
- like rickets.
- Yeah?

84
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,640
- You take vitamins, Tyrone?
- Nah.

85
00:07:00,675 --> 00:07:04,600
- I'm gonna start taking vitamins.
- Yeah, me too.

86
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,000
So, how's the wife?

87
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,520
- She cut me off, Danny.
- For how long?

88
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,760
She says until I seek
professional help.

89
00:07:22,795 --> 00:07:25,400
- For what?
- She thinks I'm getting weird in bed.

90
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,320
- Are you?
- Well...

91
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,160
we've been doin' it the same way
for the past 10 years, Danny.

92
00:07:32,195 --> 00:07:35,920
Once a week, every Saturday night,
right after the 9:00 sports, right?

93
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,600
Same position, seven minutes of
foreplay, 12 minutes of sex,

94
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,560
and we keep our pajama tops on.

95
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,080
Well, I'm getting bored out of
my skull, right, Danny?

96
00:07:44,115 --> 00:07:47,400
So I says to her, why don't
we add a little spice?

97
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,320
You know, go state of the art?

98
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,240
State of the art?

99
00:07:51,275 --> 00:07:54,520
Yeah, state of the art.
Now it's the computer age, right?

100
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,440
Electronics and stuff?

101
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,840
So I figure, I'll go to
the mature shop, right?

102
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,760
Pick up something.

103
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,680
I bought me one of these...

104
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,920
these big digital marriage
counselors, right?

105
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,840
What's that?

106
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,960
It's a big, you know,
it's like a...

107
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,320
it's a love enhancer.
It's like a device, you know?

108
00:08:11,355 --> 00:08:13,200
Ah, all right.

109
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,560
So I bring this into the bedroom
on Saturday night.

110
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,040
I pull it out, put it on her pillow,
you know, a little surprise?

111
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,680
Surprised the shit out of her.
She freaks,

112
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,240
she tries to kill it.
She thinks it's a giant centipede.

113
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,280
You're kidding!

114
00:08:26,315 --> 00:08:28,200
So I've been
on the couch ever since.

115
00:08:28,235 --> 00:08:30,080
Aw, I'm sorry to hear about that.

116
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,400
- I envy you, though.
- Me?

117
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,320
Yeah, you don't have to put up
with this bullshit and heartache.

118
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,480
You can jump in the sack
with any chick you want.

119
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,400
She don't like your habits,
you're on to the next one.

120
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,120
It's been a little slow lately.

121
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,680
You know, that's the most
infuriating thing about you.

122
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,440
You don't take advantage of
your god-given position in life.

123
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,640
When was the last time
you were on a date?

124
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,560
Two, three months ago.

125
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,440
- Nine. Try nine, Danny.
- Hey, who's counting?

126
00:08:58,475 --> 00:09:00,480
- When was the last time you got laid?
- Sal!

127
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,400
- Come on, when?
- Sal!

128
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,320
- It's been so long, you don't even remember.
- Hey, I remember.

129
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,040
- So, when?
- That's personal!

130
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,040
Oh, yeah? Why don't we try five
years personal, Danny.

131
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,920
Why don't you shut up and mind
your own business, all right?

132
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,800
All right.

133
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,400
- Good night, son.
- Good night. Ma.

134
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,240
15, hut!

135
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,080
Go on! Turn!

136
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,800
Coach says he's a natural.

137
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,640
At what?

138
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,600
At wide receiver.

139
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,520
Maybe he'll put some weight on.

140
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,440
He could be a jockey.

141
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,360
I'm kidding!

142
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,280
Or a guard or a tackle,
maybe, same thing.

143
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,200
Right, right, right.

144
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,120
On one, set! 35, hut!

145
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,240
- Go, go, go!
- Okay, Billy, Billy right there!

146
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,120
- Catch the ball, Billy!
- I hate this game!

147
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,400
Billy! Would you come back
and practice?

148
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,360
What does he have to practice for?
He's a natural.

149
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,680
Let's get a beer.

150
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,600
- How's work?
- It's fine.

151
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,560
Aren't you getting tired of it?

152
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,680
No, sal and i, we have
a lot of laughs.

153
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,000
Still, Danny, you've been driving
that wagon for what, 15 years,

154
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,080
picking up stiffs,
hauling away criminals,

155
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,000
you deserve better.

156
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,920
I don't want better.

157
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,560
I am this close to John Burroughs,
your superintendent.

158
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,480
We play golf every Sunday.

159
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,440
Just say the word, and I can get
you transferred to Florida.

160
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,600
- No, I don't want to go.
- Come on, Danny.

161
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,040
You and mom can get that waterfront
condo you've been talking about.

162
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,960
I don't want to go to Florida.

163
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,880
I'm not ready to retire yet, okay?

164
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,800
Okay.

165
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,720
- Say the word.
- Fine, thank you.

166
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,800
You haven't got any spice on this.

167
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,720
Oh, it gives patrick headaches.

168
00:11:03,755 --> 00:11:05,880
He never had headaches
when he lived with me.

169
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,400
So, how's mom?
She looks tired.

170
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,640
She needs a change, you know?

171
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,560
Different environment.

172
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,040
Susan and I would take
her for a while.

173
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,600
You would?

174
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,840
- Yeah, but she'd hate it here.
- Maybe not.

175
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,360
I think she's happier
in her own house.

176
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,280
You know, where we grew up,

177
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,840
where she and dad lived,
where she knew everybody.

178
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,160
And where I can take care
of her, right?

179
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,080
Well, yeah, that too, so what?

180
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,520
I mean, you make her happy, Dan.

181
00:11:36,555 --> 00:11:39,480
- You're her favorite son.
- Don't pull that.

182
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:43,200
Plus you get your meals cooked,
your laundry done and your bed made.

183
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:46,200
Believe me, you'll never find
a wife who'll do all that.

184
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,280
You're a good lawyer, Patrick.

185
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,480
A very good lawyer.

186
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,520
You know, maybe a gymnast.

187
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,680
- Good evening, Tom.
- Evening, rose, evening, Danny.

188
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,640
Ah, two more thirsty mouths.

189
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,560
The usual, is it?

190
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,480
- What do you suppose?
- What's the score?

191
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,920
Boston's winning by three.

192
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,400
- Aw, jeez.
- You didn't miss much.

193
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,880
Three doubles.

194
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,080
I'm sorry, boys, but
I can't be serving you.

195
00:12:39,115 --> 00:12:42,240
- Why?
- You've already had a bit too much...

196
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,200
and your friend there is fluthered.

197
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,240
Fluthered? Parched, he is.

198
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,160
He hasn't wet his lips in 24 hours.

199
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,160
Frank...

200
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,280
don't you recognize
your old pal, here?

201
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,440
Holy mother of god.

202
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,320
- It's Tommy Bones!
- So?

203
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,240
He died yesterday.

204
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,160
Get him out of here!

205
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,080
We can explain. Larry, explain.

206
00:13:08,115 --> 00:13:10,520
One August, back in '58,

207
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,760
me and Jack here, we made
a promise to Tommy.

208
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,480
We swore we'd bring him back
to O'Neill's.

209
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,000
The night before his wake,
for one last Jameson.

210
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,600
For his journey.

211
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,520
It's a sacred duty, then?

212
00:13:23,555 --> 00:13:25,840
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, it is.

213
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,560
Let it never be said...

214
00:13:29,595 --> 00:13:32,720
that an O'Neill broke
a promise to the dead.

215
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,880
Three doubles it is!

216
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,840
And if he drinks it,
it's on the house.

217
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,440
Grave robbers! Give him back!

218
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,480
- After he's had a drink.
- No, right now.

219
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,080
When he's had a drink!

220
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,840
Look, I could have you two arrested!

221
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,760
You can't walk into a funeral
home, take a corpse...

222
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,160
and bring it to a tavern.
What's the matter with you?

223
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,160
- For god's!
- What's going on here?

224
00:13:59,195 --> 00:14:01,080
Officer, these two idiots...

225
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,120
snuck into my funeral home
and took the body...

226
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,400
while my daughter Theresa
was on her coffee break.

227
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,040
All right, you two
are gonna take him back.

228
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,640
That is, unless you decide
to press charges.

229
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:13,800
No, I don't want
to press charges.

230
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,680
Fine, take the body back.
He can't drink anyway.

231
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,200
What did you do, sew his lips shut?

232
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,160
That's enough.
I want you to take the man back.

233
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,960
Understand?
And then the both of you go home.

234
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,540
Don't break him.

235
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,440
All right.

236
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,360
So that was Joey Luna?

237
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,360
He's got the parlor
over there on Morgan St.?

238
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,960
- That's right.
- I guess that was his daughter.

239
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,920
- She works for him.
- Oh, yeah? Doing what?

240
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,800
- Painting faces.
- Dead faces?

241
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,120
Couldn't get a job right out
of cosmetic school.

242
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,960
- She married?
- No, you know how it is.

243
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,200
The business she's in,
turns most guys off.

244
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,120
Oh, it would, yeah.

245
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,120
- Why, you interested?
- No, just curious, that's all.

246
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,880
If you are, go for it. Don't waste
your time. Ask the girl out.

247
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,800
- No, no, no.
- Why should he?

248
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,400
He's perfectly happy.
Why screw things up?

249
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,320
Don't listen to him, Danny boy.

250
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,280
- Don't end up bachelors like the two of us.
- Speak for yourself!

251
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:17,160
Danny's doing fine.

252
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,000
He doesn't have to go chasing some
ghoul from a funeral parlor...

253
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,040
for a date.
He can do better than that.

254
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,200
He doesn't have time to do better.

255
00:15:24,235 --> 00:15:25,640
All the good ones will be taken.

256
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,560
The girls should be chasing him.

257
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,400
I don't believe this.
I'm getting romantic advice...

258
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,320
from a widow and two bachelors.

259
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,240
One very experienced bachelor.

260
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,600
Celibacy is considered experience?

261
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,520
- I've had my share of women.
- Three.

262
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,560
Just never been stupid
enough to marry them.

263
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,480
You never been fortunate enough.

264
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,320
- They all said no.
- If I'd gotten married,

265
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,320
- I wouldn't be where I am now.
- In a tavern?

266
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,320
Free, living like a king.

267
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,240
You live at the "y".

268
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,160
I don't have
to answer to anyone.

269
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,920
I come and go as I please, I do
what I want, when I want.

270
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,520
Don't listen to him, Danny boy.
Call that girl.

271
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,720
Don't spend your life
full of regrets.

272
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,440
You missed a spot.

273
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,600
It was just a joke.
I didn't mean to scare you.

274
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,440
No one is allowed back here.

275
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,200
Sorry, I...

276
00:18:00,235 --> 00:18:02,040
is there a problem?

277
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,600
No, no problem at all.

278
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,800
Actually...

279
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,920
I saw you at O'Neill's
the other night.

280
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,160
And, uh,

281
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,400
well...

282
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,960
I...

283
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,760
don't you just hate all that
awkward stuff that...

284
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,320
goes with asking someone out on
a date for the first time?

285
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,960
I'll make it easy for you.

286
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,920
Give you a list of possible excuses.

287
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,520
Things I've heard
a million times before.

288
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:46,040
All you have to do is say yes or no.

289
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,160
That way it takes the pressure
off both of us.

290
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,080
Make sense to you?

291
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,000
Yeah.

292
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,240
Good, okay. Here we go.

293
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,160
Reasons why you can't go out
with me on Saturday.

294
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,160
- You're seeing somebody else.
- No.

295
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,440
- You're having your wisdom teeth pulled.
- Nope.

296
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,800
- You're washing your hair.
- No.

297
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,720
- You're going shopping.
- No.

298
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,000
You have to baby-sit for your
neighbor's kids, nieces or nephews.

299
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,800
- No.
- You're doing laundry.

300
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,840
No.

301
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,720
- You have to lube your car?
- No.

302
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,400
You're getting your legs waxed.

303
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,320
No.

304
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,400
I think that just about
covers everything.

305
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,800
You forgot one thing.

306
00:19:30,835 --> 00:19:32,680
What's that?

307
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,360
If somebody dies, I'm stuck here.

308
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,760
Oh, sure, of course.
Yeah, that, yeah, sure.

309
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,280
But nobody died yet.

310
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,560
So, you're-you're free?

311
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,080
That's terrific!
Great, thanks, okay.

312
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,640
That's wonderful. Thank you.

313
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,040
How about 7:00? I'll pick you up?

314
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:03,280
Where do you live?

315
00:20:03,315 --> 00:20:07,600
- Here.
- With the stiffs?

316
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,040
My father and I have
an apartment upstairs.

317
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:15,480
Oh, sure, of course,
that's convenient.

318
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,400
Yeah, it would be.

319
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,560
- So 7:00, then?
- If nobody dies.

320
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,760
If nobody dies, of course.

321
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,600
7:00.

322
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,720
Did you mean him
to look like Clark Gable?

323
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,640
- Yeah.
- You did that?

324
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,560
Yeah.

325
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,000
Wow! That's very good!
That's a talent.

326
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,240
Yeah, that's terrific!

327
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,160
He's a dead ringer.

328
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,080
I didn't mean dead like that.

329
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,880
I don't mean dead, like that dead.

330
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,200
I'm sorry, I didn't mean...
you know what I meant.

331
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,960
In fairness to...
I'll see you at 7:00.

332
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,040
- Okay.
- Great, great.

333
00:20:54,075 --> 00:20:55,960
I'll close up here for you.

334
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,160
I'll get these. I'm sorry...

335
00:20:59,195 --> 00:21:01,000
if I bothered you.

336
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,800
Don't screw this one up, Theresa.

337
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,920
Yeah!

338
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,720
I'm sorry. See, I just got lucky
in there, with a girl.

339
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,120
I didn't mean it like that.
It's not what you're thinking.

340
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,520
She does everybody in there.

341
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,440
Not in that way.

342
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,960
But she probably did that guy
there, for example.

343
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,200
I gotta go.

344
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,560
- Can you believe that guy?
- No.

345
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,200
- Hello, Marty. Hello, Doug.
- Hi.

346
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,920
Rose?

347
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,720
Rose, I'm trying again.

348
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,680
Will you please
accept these flowers?

349
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,840
I don't want them.
And I don't date greeks.

350
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,240
You and I could make
make each other...

351
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,160
- so happy.
- Oh, forget it.

352
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,200
Greek men are great lovers.

353
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,040
And Greek men never bathe.

354
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,000
I bathe twice a day.

355
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,520
Three times when I do my sit-ups.

356
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,760
Feel that stomach. Hard!

357
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,120
Like an 18-year-old.

358
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,040
Come on, feel it.

359
00:22:30,075 --> 00:22:32,600
- I'm not feeling anything of yours.
- Rose.

360
00:22:32,635 --> 00:22:35,480
You've forgotten what a sweet thing...

361
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,880
romance can be.

362
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,920
Come to my bed. You will never leave.

363
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,840
Have a little respect!
You're speaking to a lady.

364
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,960
I apologize. I spoke with my heart,

365
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,880
and not my head.

366
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,640
A beautiful woman like you...

367
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,480
has that effect on me.

368
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,080
Oh, Danny.

369
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,000
Where are you going all dressed up?

370
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,840
I've got a date, sort of.

371
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,960
That's your father's jacket.

372
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,520
It fits pretty good, doesn't it?

373
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,120
And your tie,
just like your father.

374
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,680
You always make the knot too big.

375
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,600
Let's see. There, now.

376
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,000
Oh, Danny, give these to your girl.

377
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,720
Women love flowers. Some of them.

378
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,960
Thanks. I gotta go.

379
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,240
Oh, he's got a girl.

380
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,760
He's lucky.

381
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,480
I hope you don't mind coming here.

382
00:24:04,515 --> 00:24:07,040
I wanted to bring you somewhere
special on our first date.

383
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,520
Danny, want me to turn
the scoreboard lights on?

384
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,600
You want to see the scoreboard?
It's really something.

385
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,720
- Yeah.
- Go for it, Leo!

386
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,880
Okay!

387
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,920
That's great!

388
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,760
Pretty, huh?

389
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,400
- Thanks, Leo!
- No problem, Danny!

390
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,560
It's a shame they're going to
tear the whole place down.

391
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,360
Leo, he's been around here...

392
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,560
jeez, as long as I can remember.
Great guy!

393
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,080
He lets me in any time I want.

394
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,200
Sometimes it's good to be a cop.

395
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,200
Oh, yeah.

396
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,560
My brother had his bachelor party here.

397
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,560
It was great!
We played baseball all night.

398
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,960
We had half-barrels on the bases
so every time a guy got a hit...

399
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,200
and you got on base
you had to chug a pint.

400
00:25:46,235 --> 00:25:49,840
So all night it was hit, drink,
hit, drink, hit, drink.

401
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,760
All night long it went like that!

402
00:25:51,795 --> 00:25:54,720
It was gr...
In the morning, okay,

403
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,640
the sox came out,
they got a day game.

404
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,200
They came out here, 20 drunken
Irishmen all over the infield.

405
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,480
It was a mess!

406
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,240
Guys were throwing up. Oh god.

407
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,160
That was funny.

408
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,240
That's the wrong story to tell you.

409
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,000
I didn't mean to bring that one up.

410
00:26:12,035 --> 00:26:14,960
That's a bad story to tell on a first date.
That's not a good story.

411
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,120
I'm sorry, that's a bad story.

412
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,640
It was funny, but that's not a
good one to tell you,

413
00:26:19,675 --> 00:26:21,480
I'm sorry about that.

414
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,720
I've been Mr. Motormouth
all night long.

415
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,160
Gee, I'm sorry. Why don't you take
the floor for a while?

416
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,520
- Me?
- Yeah.

417
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,720
You don't want to hear about me.

418
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,040
- Yes I do.
- It's boring.

419
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,920
No, come on!

420
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,400
Like what?

421
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,600
Like anything,
I don't know, like...

422
00:26:48,635 --> 00:26:50,600
what your favorite color is,

423
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,560
what you're gonna
do with your life,

424
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,120
how many brothers and sisters you got?

425
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,960
I don't care. Really, anything.

426
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,520
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to put
you on the spot.

427
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,640
Light blue.

428
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,120
Sorry?

429
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,080
My favorite color is light blue.

430
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,200
That's a very nice color.

431
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,720
Light blue, yeah.

432
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,080
It's terrific.

433
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,960
Boy, it's a shame they're gonna
tear this all down.

434
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,560
Was everything okay with dinner?

435
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,400
It was fine.

436
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,400
See, you didn't eat much.

437
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,960
It was very good. Thanks.

438
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,720
Chicken was a little
greasy, wasn't it?

439
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,080
No.

440
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,520
It's not late. Want to go out
for a drink?

441
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,560
Watch yourself there.

442
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,480
No, I...

443
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,640
I have to work in the morning.

444
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,240
- Somebody die?
- Two people.

445
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,480
- Big day, huh?
- Yeah.

446
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,520
Well...

447
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,720
goodnight.

448
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,400
Goodnight.

449
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,120
Goodnight.

450
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,680
Danny.

451
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,840
Yeah?

452
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,160
Is everything okay?

453
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,840
You all right?

454
00:28:54,875 --> 00:28:58,280
I had a wonderful time tonight.

455
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,560
You did?

456
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,520
I know it seemed like I didn't.

457
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,720
Seemed like you wanted to be
on another planet.

458
00:29:04,755 --> 00:29:06,640
I didn't.

459
00:29:06,675 --> 00:29:09,440
Look, I know I talk too much
sometimes, and I apologize...

460
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,360
No, it's not you.

461
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,400
It's me.

462
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,240
You?

463
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,160
I have this thing.

464
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,880
What thing?

465
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,000
I have this...

466
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,120
introverted kind of thing.

467
00:29:28,155 --> 00:29:30,760
Introverted?
That just means you're shy.

468
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,800
No, it's worse than shy.

469
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,720
I guess it doesn't help
spending eight hours a day...

470
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,600
with people who don't
talk back to you.

471
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,600
No, I guess not.

472
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,680
But I'm trying to get past it.

473
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,560
To beat it.

474
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,200
And it isn't easy,
but if you could just...

475
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,560
bear with me and maybe
give me one more chance,

476
00:29:54,595 --> 00:29:57,000
I think I'm gonna get a lot better,

477
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,800
because I'm feeling...

478
00:29:59,835 --> 00:30:02,400
very comfortable around you.

479
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,040
And I would really like
to go out with you again.

480
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,760
If you would, you know,

481
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,840
like to go out with me again.

482
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,760
I'd love to see you again.

483
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,040
- Yeah?
- What are you, nuts?

484
00:30:16,075 --> 00:30:17,880
I didn't mean that.

485
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,960
That's good. That's great.

486
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,480
Yeah! That is great.

487
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,960
There's a waterway terrace,
20 miles from st. Pete.

488
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,360
- Is that you, Danny?
- Yeah, ma.

489
00:30:34,395 --> 00:30:36,720
- How was your date?
- It was nice, very nice.

490
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,160
Did you spend all evening
talking about dead bodies?

491
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,040
No, we didn't talk shop.

492
00:30:41,075 --> 00:30:43,960
What are you doing here so late?
Susan kick you out of the house?

493
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,880
He's got a surprise for you.

494
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,160
Oh, yeah? What's that?

495
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,400
You're moving to Florida.

496
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,320
I'm what?

497
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,400
You and mom.
You're moving to St. Pete.

498
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:56,640
I played 18
with burroughs yesterday,

499
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,280
he agreed to move you
to a Florida precinct.

500
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,480
Why? Why now?

501
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,160
I needed an investment. I was
thinking about our talk.

502
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,080
And Danny, you're absolutely right.

503
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,000
Mom needs a change of pace.

504
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,080
Yeah, but what about me?

505
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,440
Maybe I'm not ready to leave Chicago.

506
00:31:15,475 --> 00:31:17,320
You'll want to leave Chicago eventually.

507
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,320
So what difference does it make
if it's a couple of years earlier?

508
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,600
Why wouldn't you talk to me first?

509
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,600
I wanted to surprise you.

510
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,440
It's a surprise, all right.
So is being hit by a bus.

511
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,240
Now be polite.

512
00:31:30,275 --> 00:31:32,840
This is costing Patrick
a lot of money.

513
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,600
Look, I don't want
to rain on your parade,

514
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,520
but I'd like to be
included in a decision...

515
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,600
- that's gonna affect the rest of my life.
- Hey, Danny,

516
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,640
this is gonna be great
for all of us.

517
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,840
Yeah, well you're
not the one that's moving.

518
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,960
Would you think about Ma?

519
00:31:49,995 --> 00:31:51,880
All her relatives live down there.

520
00:31:51,915 --> 00:31:53,840
Think about how happy she's gonna be.

521
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,400
And you don't have to worry about
her slipping on the ice...

522
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,120
and breaking her hip. Or catching
pneumonia from that draft upstairs.

523
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,040
Yeah.

524
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,960
Or walking into the side of a cab...

525
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,280
because she's too stubborn
to buy a pair of glasses.

526
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,800
- You're right.
- Danny,

527
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,040
you should have seen her face
when I told her.

528
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,400
- Really?
- 20 years just...

529
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,240
melted away.

530
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,640
- Where's the stinker?
- Apartment 603.

531
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,560
The elevator's broken so
you're gonna...

532
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,480
have to carry the body
down the stairs.

533
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,440
Son of a bitch!

534
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,600
Wagon men.
You couldn't pay me enough.

535
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,240
So, you get laid, or what?

536
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,600
No, no, it was just a date.

537
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,240
- What's her name?
- Theresa.

538
00:32:55,275 --> 00:32:57,960
Theresa. The lovely Theresa!

539
00:32:57,995 --> 00:32:59,640
Would you stop that?

540
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,600
So was she good
in the sack, or what?

541
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,480
Will you drop it, please?

542
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,640
Speaking of which...
oh, my back!

543
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,640
God damn elevator!

544
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,000
I'm not carrying this guy down six flights
of stairs, I'll tell you that now.

545
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,040
What do you want to do,
roll him down the stairs?

546
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,200
Just a second.

547
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,080
Check it out, man!

548
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,040
Hey, Sal.

549
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,960
- Yeah.
- About the football game.

550
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,920
Oh yeah, I'm really excited, man.

551
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,600
50 yardline seats.
They're playing the packers.

552
00:33:37,635 --> 00:33:40,960
We'll be able to nab some good
autographs from the sidelines.

553
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,200
Yeah, um, I can't go.

554
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,560
What? It's not bingo night, is it?

555
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,200
No, I promised Theresa
I'd take her to the ballet.

556
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,080
The ballet, huh?

557
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,680
- Pussy whipped.
- Pardon?

558
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,320
Look, I can give two shits
about the game.

559
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,520
It's you I'm worried about.

560
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,440
- Me?
- Yeah.

561
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,560
Hey, don't go getting serious and
falling for this chick, all right?

562
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,960
Why, is something wrong with that?

563
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,760
Well, you know, you gotta leave
your options open, Danny.

564
00:34:09,795 --> 00:34:13,120
That's all. Lady-wise, you've
broken a dry spell, right?

565
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,360
So, maybe you're on a roll, that's all.

566
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,320
You know, ask out
some of the other babes.

567
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,960
Sample some of the other flavors.
That's what I would do,

568
00:34:19,995 --> 00:34:22,800
you know what I mean?
Otherwise, you're gonna get trapped.

569
00:34:22,835 --> 00:34:24,720
Believe me,

570
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,600
it's miserable.

571
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,800
Huh?

572
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,720
Okay, we got it.

573
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,800
All right.

574
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,720
Aw, shit!

575
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,840
- What'll we do now?
- Guess we have to bring him back up.

576
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,120
I ain't bringing him back up.
He's too damn heavy!

577
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,160
What do you suggest we do?

578
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,440
- Cut the hose.
- Cut the hose?

579
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,360
- Yeah, let him fall.
- To the ground?

580
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,280
- Yeah.
- A fall like that could kill a guy.

581
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,000
He's dead, for Christ's sake!
He's not gonna feel nothing.

582
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,040
- I don't think it's such a bright idea.
- Why not?

583
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,360
Well for one thing, look at the
crowd down there.

584
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,440
Maybe you're right.

585
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,520
Let's just bring him up.

586
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,800
Aw, shit.

587
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,360
Sometimes, it is not good
to be a cop.

588
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:33,120
- How much is it?
- That's $790 plus tax.

589
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,600
I'll take it.

590
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,480
Oh, good.

591
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,280
Is there a lay-away plan?

592
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,360
- Oh, yes sir.
- Mmm.

593
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,760
- Good.
- Of course, the suit has to stay here.

594
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,600
Oh, sure. I knew that.

595
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,200
I don't suppose
you can rent the suit?

596
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,120
No, sir, not at this store.

597
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,160
- I was joking. I knew that.
- Yes.

598
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,400
Yeah, no, I'll take it.
I like it very much.

599
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,440
- Nice lines to it.
- It looks very nice on you, sir.

600
00:36:06,475 --> 00:36:08,840
- Not too flashy, huh?
- No, no.

601
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,080
- It's very conservative.
- Yeah, that's me.

602
00:36:11,115 --> 00:36:13,760
I'm very conservative myself.

603
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,800
- So I would naturally go, you know...
- Yeah.

604
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,720
for a more conservative look.

605
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,840
It looks much like a banker.

606
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,400
Really? Banker.

607
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,480
Yeah.

608
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,160
Hello. How much would
you like today?

609
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,880
$790.

610
00:36:32,915 --> 00:36:34,800
- Go ahead.
- All right.

611
00:36:34,835 --> 00:36:37,280
Don't forget to say thank you.

612
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,000
- Want some more candy?
- Yeah, as much as we can.

613
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,920
Coming.

614
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,120
Trick or treat.

615
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,680
Tell your parents
these are from Rose Muldoon.

616
00:36:47,715 --> 00:36:51,280
- Cooked in her own kitchen.
- Okay, thank you.

617
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,520
- Good bye.
- Bye.

618
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,240
- Where are you going all dressed up?
- I'm going on a date.

619
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,960
- Since when?
- Since last week when I told you.

620
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
- You did not.
- I did too.

621
00:37:02,035 --> 00:37:04,960
I told you this Saturday night I'm
taking Theresa to the ballet.

622
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,880
Oh, I would have remembered.

623
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,000
And who's gonna help me
hand out the apples now?

624
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,920
Come on, Ma, you can do it.

625
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,840
We only get about 50
trick or treaters.

626
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,760
You think I'm going
to that door alone?

627
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,600
What if it's a crack maniac
dressed as Frankenstein?

628
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,440
Or a rapist dressed up
like elmer fudd?

629
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,680
Well I'll tell you
what you do, ma.

630
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,080
You peek out the window.
And if Elmer Fudd's...

631
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,640
over four feet tall,
you don't let him in.

632
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:34,160
We always gave out the apples
together on halloween.

633
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,640
You must have some sort
of affection for this girl.

634
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,360
New suit. Ballet.
Fancy schmancy.

635
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,200
Theresa happens to be
a very nice girl, Ma.

636
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,520
Is she Irish?

637
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,200
No. No, she's not.

638
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:52,680
She's...
she's Italian.

639
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,200
- A Guinea?
- Oh, Ma.

640
00:37:55,235 --> 00:37:58,200
Oh, at least tell me
she's not a Sicilian, please?

641
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,640
She is Sicilian, Ma.

642
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,680
- Black death.
- Oh Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

643
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,760
How many times have I told you
to keep away from those Sicilians?

644
00:38:11,795 --> 00:38:14,760
They'll cut your stomach out if they
think you've swallowed a penny.

645
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,240
I gotta get out of here.

646
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,360
And who started the Cosa Nostra?

647
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,880
The Sicilians. Who invented
prostitution, drugs, gambling?

648
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,600
The Sicilians.
My father used to always say...

649
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,320
I know, I know. "I'd rather spend
eternity in hell...

650
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,240
than shake hands with a Sicilian".

651
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,640
- See to it you remember that tonight.
- I will.

652
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,360
I gotta go. Have a happy
halloween, Ma.

653
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,680
You too.

654
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,840
There'll be a lot of pretty
Irish girls in Florida.

655
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,480
- Sometimes it's good to be a cop.
- Yeah.

656
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,880
Hold on.

657
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,040
Aw. Look at that.

658
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,560
What a darling little costume.

659
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,920
Aren't we scary?

660
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,080
Trick or treat!

661
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,080
Now shut up and get inside!

662
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,760
You crack maniac!

663
00:39:43,795 --> 00:39:47,320
If my son were here he'd shoot you.
Shoot you dead!

664
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:51,280
Does your mother know what you're
doing for a living?

665
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,240
Oh, Danny.

666
00:40:05,275 --> 00:40:09,360
I hope your fancy schmancy
ballet was worth it.

667
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,040
I'll be right back.

668
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,920
Sorry.

669
00:40:40,955 --> 00:40:42,920
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

670
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,760
I just had to check on my mom.

671
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,640
Oh.

672
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,760
- I'd like to do make-up for Broadway.
- Really?

673
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,880
- Maybe give New York a shot.
- Why not, you know?

674
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,800
If you think about it,
what I do every day...

675
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,040
is like the theater. I mean,

676
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,680
you've got this person on display
in front of everybody.

677
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,800
- You've got to make them look good.
- Of course.

678
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,800
That's why when somebody dies,

679
00:41:57,835 --> 00:42:00,720
the first thing I do is figure out
what celebrity they look like.

680
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,320
Then I fix up the dead person
to look just like them.

681
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,240
- That's a talent.
- It's good practice.

682
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,200
I haven't had any complaints
from the relatives.

683
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,760
So far.

684
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,040
This is a plan to get
me out of the house.

685
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,120
I don't like it.
I don't like being used.

686
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,040
You're not being used.

687
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:20,400
Patrick and susan just want to spend
some time alone with you, that's all.

688
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,720
And you want to spend some
time alone with this girl.

689
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,640
I just want to have
a nice dinner with her.

690
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:28,120
Any silverware she uses, wash it
twice, heavy on the rinse cycle.

691
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,760
Those Sicilian germs stick
to your forks like glue.

692
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,680
Why don't you take
her out to dinner?

693
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,600
Because I want to cook.

694
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,000
Ha. She eats your cooking,
it'll be a short romance.

695
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,920
Well, I learned from the best.

696
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,320
Kidding! I'm kidding!

697
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,880
- Nick the Greek asked me for a date.
- Yeah? You gonna go?

698
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,200
I told him I'd consider it
if he did something for me.

699
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,120
- Yeah, like what?
- Watch this house.

700
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,840
- Watch this house? Why?
- Let me know when that girl leaves.

701
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,080
If she's not out of here
by 1:00, nick will tell me.

702
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,000
What?

703
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,240
Why would you do that?

704
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,480
I guard the most dangerous
criminals in Chicago.

705
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,400
I think I can look after my own life.

706
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,840
There are bars between
you and those prisoners.

707
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:06,760
Nick! Don't forget.

708
00:44:06,795 --> 00:44:08,720
- Hi, Ma.
- Hi.

709
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,840
- Good luck, Danny.
- Thanks.

710
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,680
Nick, how could you do this to me?

711
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,520
I'm a lonely man, Danny.

712
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,720
In love with a woman who...

713
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,800
despises me.

714
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,440
I'm...
I'm desperate.

715
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,040
But don't worry.

716
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,720
I won't let my heartache...

717
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,880
interfere with your chances
for romance.

718
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,760
As far as I'm concerned, that girl...

719
00:44:45,795 --> 00:44:50,240
will leave this house
this evening at 11:35 pm...

720
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:53,520
on the button.

721
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,720
I owe you, Nick.

722
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,640
Ow! Jeez!

723
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,240
A little bit more.

724
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,400
- Son of a bitch!
- Hi.

725
00:45:50,435 --> 00:45:52,960
Hi.

726
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,840
The door was open, so I thought
I'd just come in.

727
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,840
Good, sure, yeah.

728
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,360
Is everything okay?

729
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,040
Actually, no.

730
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,840
I just destroyed dinner.

731
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,360
Ma usually does the cooking.

732
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,440
I'm not really that hungry anyway.

733
00:46:14,475 --> 00:46:16,280
Really?

734
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,000
Good.

735
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,760
Very good.

736
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,120
And this, of course,
is my room.

737
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,080
I gotta really decorate it up.

738
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,160
It's starting to look
like an old elk's lodge.

739
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,560
- It's nice.
- Oh, and what is this?

740
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,520
I guess the maid left it.

741
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:43,000
You were planning this.

742
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:48,360
No, I wasn't planning anything.

743
00:46:48,395 --> 00:46:51,760
I didn't expect you to just come
in here and, you know,

744
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:56,000
jump in... no. No, I didn't mean
that, I meant...

745
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,880
a little bit I was planning.
Just a little bit.

746
00:46:58,915 --> 00:47:00,960
You know, just this far.

747
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,800
It's okay.
I told my father

748
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:08,240
I was going to spend the night
at my girlfriend's house.

749
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,560
Really?

750
00:47:12,595 --> 00:47:14,400
Yeah.

751
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,560
Hey, that's great.

752
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,920
What is it?

753
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:35,440
Oh, it's silly, you know, really.

754
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,360
What it is, it's just...

755
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,280
it's catholic guilt is what it is.

756
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,320
That's exactly what it is.

757
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,440
Sorry.

758
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,120
Now, you were saying
something about...

759
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,320
morning! Time to wake up.

760
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,400
Come on, rise and shine.

761
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,240
- It's breakfast.
- You made me breakfast?

762
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,400
Well, sort of, yeah.
It's a little burnt toast...

763
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,320
and lumpy tea.

764
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,720
- Oh!
- The tea bag burst in there.

765
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:31,560
I think there's a lot of seeds
and twigs in there.

766
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,480
No, that's so sweet.

767
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,960
Well, I wouldn't
eat it, I don't know.

768
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,520
Oh, what time did
that girl leave?

769
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,800
11:35 pm, on the button.

770
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:53,680
Hey, hey!

771
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:55,880
We have a date, huh?

772
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:00,480
I'm busy this week.
Talk to me next week.

773
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,400
Rose! Hey, Rose!

774
00:49:02,435 --> 00:49:04,800
A promise is a promise. Hey!

775
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,240
Damn women.

776
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:15,120
- Danny?
- Oh my god, it's my mom!

777
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,040
- Hurry up, come on!
- Where am I gonna go?

778
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,960
- You gotta hide, hide, hide.
- Where?

779
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,360
No, not here!
Over there, over there!

780
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,320
- Where?
- Just wait there. Don't say anything.

781
00:49:25,355 --> 00:49:27,240
Danny?

782
00:49:27,275 --> 00:49:29,680
- My clothes!
- Clothes, you got clothes.

783
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,600
What is she doing home now?

784
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:34,960
- Danny, I'm home.
- Ah! Ma!

785
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,880
What are you doing home so early?

786
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,080
I took the early train
before anybody was awake.

787
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,920
Oh, good.

788
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,360
- What's that for?
- Keeping your promise.

789
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,920
Nick said you had that dago girl
out of here at 11:35...

790
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,560
- on the button.
- Dago girl?

791
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,400
Oh yeah, almost forgot that.

792
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,680
I'll go to my room and unpack my bags.

793
00:50:00,715 --> 00:50:02,680
Okay, why don't you do that?

794
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:13,280
- What's this?
- It's a hat. It's a hat.

795
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:16,480
- Sacrilegious!
- Wait, I'll do it! I'll do that!

796
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:19,120
Don't do that when I can do that
when I could have done that.

797
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,800
What on earth is the matter with you?

798
00:50:22,835 --> 00:50:25,880
Nothing. Nothing.

799
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,120
- Didn't you sleep well?
- Yes... no. No I didn't.

800
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,040
We'd better get you a new mattress.

801
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,360
Oh, good idea. Very good idea.

802
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,840
Yeah, that's what we have to do.

803
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,040
Okay, come on. Hurry up.

804
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:43,000
- Will you hurry?
- I'm hurrying.

805
00:50:44,955 --> 00:50:47,600
I'm 38 years old.
I don't need this.

806
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,880
I'm getting chest pains.
Hurry up, will you?

807
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:54,760
- So that was your mother, huh?
- Yeah, that was her.

808
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,480
- What do you think?
- Dago girl?

809
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,120
Oh, that. She's got a very
eccentric vocabulary.

810
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,040
Had she known you
were in the room...

811
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:04,000
she never would have
said it, believe me.

812
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:06,640
You look very nice, by the way.

813
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,520
Hello.

814
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,800
I'll be down in a minute
and make you some breakfast.

815
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,080
Oh, that'll be nice.

816
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,480
Yeah, a little breakfast.

817
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,080
- Bye.
- Bye.

818
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,200
Mom, promise me you'll
be on your best behavior.

819
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,160
- Oh, I will, I will.
- Okay, thank you.

820
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,400
There she is.

821
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,360
Where are her breasts?

822
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,280
- What?
- She's got no breasts.

823
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:28,520
Did she have some
sort of an operation?

824
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:31,680
She's fine. It's her dress.
It's just a little big on top, that's all.

825
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,880
- Is she anorexic or anything?
- No!

826
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,720
If she goes to the bathroom more
than three times during dinner...

827
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,800
- that's a sign she's bulimic.
- What?

828
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:42,200
She's throwing up what she just
ate in the bathroom.

829
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,120
Please. Hi!

830
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,080
- Hi.
- How are you?

831
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,160
Uh, ma, this is Theresa.

832
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,080
Theresa, this is my mother.

833
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,000
Pleased to meet you, Mrs. Muldoon.

834
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,920
Rose. I'm Rose.

835
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,840
Rose.

836
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,200
- That's a lovely dress you're wearing.
- Isn't it?

837
00:52:58,235 --> 00:53:00,480
- Thank you.
- Even though it is a little big on top.

838
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,400
- Ma!
- Well it is. You said so yourself.

839
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:06,080
- Ma!
- No, that's a problem I have.

840
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,160
I'm not really
that endowed on top.

841
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,600
- No, no, no.
- You're built like a 13-year-old boy.

842
00:53:10,635 --> 00:53:12,520
Mom, would you please? Don't start.

843
00:53:12,555 --> 00:53:14,720
It's a joke.
I'm trying to make jokes here.

844
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:18,240
- I'm trying to lighten things up a little.
- Okay. Thank you.

845
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:21,640
- Would anyone like a cocktail?
- I'll have a beer.

846
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,560
And don't try to sneak any of that
sorry imported swill off on me

847
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,760
at $6 a bottle. Just a plain
glass of budweiser.

848
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,000
Yes, ma'am. Sir?

849
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,720
I'll have a beer.
Just any beer is fine.

850
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,640
Yes, ma'am?

851
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:37,000
I'll have a vodka double
on the rocks.

852
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,280
- Good.
- Oh, a vodka drinker.

853
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,200
Ma, Theresa's probably
a little nervous.

854
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:44,680
You know, being here with us and all.
You can understand that.

855
00:53:44,715 --> 00:53:46,560
It's the first signs of alcoholism.

856
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:49,120
- What?
- I read it in "Reader's Digest".

857
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:52,120
Rose, I can assure you
I'm not an alcoholic.

858
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,120
Oh, denial,
that's another symptom.

859
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,920
The article said
that one shot of vodka...

860
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:00,280
was equal to all the calories
in a ham sandwich.

861
00:54:00,315 --> 00:54:03,920
Good. Maybe I'll gain some weight
and grow breasts for you.

862
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,280
That's funny!

863
00:54:07,315 --> 00:54:09,520
Growing brea...

864
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:17,360
Let's order, shall we?
Shall we order? Theresa?

865
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,040
Ma?

866
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,920
- I know what I may...
- Yes, sir?

867
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,120
I'll have the shrimp cocktail, please.

868
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,640
And the caesar salad, no anchovies.

869
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:31,040
And the prime rib, medium.

870
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,960
- Very good.
- Make that medium rare.

871
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,880
- Very good, sir.
- Thank you.

872
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:37,240
- There you go.
- Thank you. Ma'am?

873
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,400
I'll have the grilled chicken.

874
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,320
- Good.
- That's all.

875
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:47,400
- Don't you want an appetizer?
- No thank you.

876
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,800
Don't push it.

877
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,240
Ma'am?

878
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:53,960
Nothing.

879
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,480
- Nothing?
- Nothing for me.

880
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,440
- Ma!
- Just bread.

881
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:02,840
- Ma!
- Bread's fine, thank you.

882
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:06,720
Thank you.

883
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,640
Are you trying to ruin this dinner?

884
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,560
I'm trying to save you $50.

885
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:14,120
I'll fill up on bread here and then
I'll eat something when I get home.

886
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,040
I don't believe this.

887
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:19,440
Now, theresa, Danny tells me
that you're Sicilian.

888
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,400
Yes, part.

889
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,120
- Part?
- My father is Sicilian.

890
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,040
My mother was Polish.

891
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,320
- Polish.
- Yes.

892
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:35,120
- Polish?
- I meant to tell you.

893
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,920
- Polish?
- Polish.

894
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,480
I had a Polack friend once.
She was incredibly stupid.

895
00:55:42,515 --> 00:55:44,400
- Don't do this, Ma.
- Julie Kapowski.

896
00:55:44,435 --> 00:55:46,960
She was the stupidest
woman that I ever knew.

897
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,280
She believed that black cows...

898
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:53,480
black cows squirted chocolate milk!

899
00:55:53,515 --> 00:55:56,520
- Better if you and Danny have dinner alone.
- Theresa, wait.

900
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,440
Why don't you have my grilled chicken?

901
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,920
Cut it up in small pieces and devour it.
You seem to be very good at that.

902
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,360
Theresa!

903
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:12,600
Are you all right?

904
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,520
I've never been in
an argument before.

905
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:16,440
I've never said those
things to anybody.

906
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,360
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

907
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,000
Just take a deep breath.
You'll be fine.

908
00:56:21,035 --> 00:56:24,480
I actually stood up for myself
for the first time in my life.

909
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,400
Not that I had much choice.

910
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:28,320
What?

911
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,800
You just sat there. You didn't
do anything to stop her.

912
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,720
- Like what?
- I don't know,

913
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:35,480
scream at her, slap her.
Just get her to leave me alone.

914
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,200
Theresa, she's my mother.

915
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,160
So that gives her
the right to rip me apart?

916
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,080
What was I supposed to do?

917
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:44,040
- Fight for me.
- Fight for you?

918
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,960
You've gotta understand my mother.

919
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,880
She's old. She's set in her ways.

920
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,320
It's gonna take her a while
to get used to you.

921
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,280
- No it won't.
- Why not?

922
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:56,360
Because I won't be around.

923
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,760
Oh, please, don't do this.

924
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,440
No, I want a guy who will
always fight for me.

925
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:04,000
Who will always stand up for me.

926
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:06,560
Who will never let me down.

927
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,960
I thought that guy was you.

928
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,200
I was wrong.

929
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,160
- Wait a minute, Theresa.
- Taxi!

930
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,800
Come on, what are you doing?

931
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:25,000
Don't do this.
Don't do this.

932
00:57:25,035 --> 00:57:27,920
Theresa, let's talk
about it, all right?

933
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,040
Just talk to m...

934
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:05,680
I'm starving. I'm going to the
kitchen to get something to eat.

935
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,600
I suppose you're proud of yourself.

936
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:09,600
Just telling it like it is.

937
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,800
That's been your excuse for
the last 67 years.

938
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:13,920
- My excuse?
- Your excuse for hurting people...

939
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,840
whenever the hell you feel like it!

940
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:18,520
- I don't hurt people.
- Oh, no?

941
00:58:18,555 --> 00:58:21,040
I guess you didn't hurt aunt
Dolly on her wedding day...

942
00:58:21,075 --> 00:58:23,520
when you said she looked like
a cheap Las Vegas hooker.

943
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:26,720
Did you see the dress?
The back of it was cut down to here.

944
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:29,800
You could see the crack of her...
well, it was indecent.

945
00:58:29,835 --> 00:58:31,560
I guess you didn't hurt cousin Jerry...

946
00:58:31,595 --> 00:58:34,720
when you called his German wife a nazi
who probably slept with hitler.

947
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:37,400
Well, there's no proof
that she didn't.

948
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,040
I guess you never hurt dad, either.

949
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:49,640
I never hurt your father, ever.

950
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,920
Florsheim shoes?

951
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,840
How do you know about that?

952
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:58,480
You came home late.
You were arguing.

953
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:00,920
I woke up. I was scared.
I didn't know what was going on.

954
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,800
So I listened in at the door.

955
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:05,520
A little spy.

956
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:07,680
- I was only 12.
- Spy!

957
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,880
Florsheim shoes was his big account.
He worked on that...

958
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,360
- for over two and a half years.
- Danny!

959
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,120
- You blew it in one night.
- Danny, don't.

960
00:59:13,155 --> 00:59:15,000
All he had to do was sign
a deal at dinner.

961
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:18,640
One fancy schmancy dinner with
a vp from Florsheim.

962
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:22,040
I'm going to bed.

963
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:23,960
No you're not.

964
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,120
Everything was fine that evening.
Dinner was perfect.

965
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:29,120
Dad had them in the palm of his hand.

966
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,520
Until you decided it was time
to tell it like it is.

967
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:34,600
I was right.
I still stand by what I said.

968
00:59:34,635 --> 00:59:37,720
You called dad's bosses
filthy jew shylocks!

969
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,640
They never gave him a raise.

970
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:43,520
Not in 12 years.
Not one christmas bonus.

971
00:59:43,555 --> 00:59:46,120
The vice president of Florsheim
and his wife were Jewish!

972
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,440
How was I supposed to know?
They didn't look Jewish.

973
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,840
I wasn't talking about them.
They took it personal.

974
00:59:50,875 --> 00:59:52,760
You lost the account for him!

975
00:59:52,795 --> 00:59:55,120
$450,000 to the company!

976
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,040
He's lucky he didn't lose his job!

977
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:58,960
Your father never stood
up to his bosses.

978
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,320
It was time somebody
set the record straight.

979
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,280
That night...

980
01:00:06,315 --> 01:00:08,960
was the only time I ever
heard my father cry.

981
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,640
And still to this day,

982
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:14,400
you still tell it like it is.

983
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:17,760
I don't mean to hurt people.

984
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,640
Really.

985
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,400
- Where are you going?
- To halstead.

986
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:30,320
A friend of mine owns
a jewelry shop.

987
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:33,000
He owes me a favor. I'm gonna
make him open up his store.

988
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:36,200
Then I'm gonna buy the biggest
engagement ring I can afford.

989
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,760
Then I'm gonna ask Theresa
Luna to be my wife.

990
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,960
Just telling it like it is, Ma.

991
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,680
What are you doing?

992
01:01:37,715 --> 01:01:39,560
Well, I was just in
the neighborhood...

993
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,440
and I thought I'd drop by.

994
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:48,600
Sometimes it's good to be a cop.

995
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:55,880
What do you want?

996
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:02,000
I just want to say that I'll
always stand by you.

997
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:07,400
And I'll never let you down again.

998
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:12,240
I swear.

999
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:17,200
And, uh...

1000
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:42,040
I got the light blue stones.

1001
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:45,000
I thought you'd like that.

1002
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,200
Will you marry me?

1003
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:03,440
Yes.

1004
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:06,960
Great!

1005
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,560
Hey, Mr. Happy, how about a towel?

1006
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,480
Getting married. Mail-order bride?

1007
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,600
That bobby's a real asshole,
you know that?

1008
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,520
Hey, Danny.

1009
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:44,680
My best friend is making the
biggest mistake of his life.

1010
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,400
So I thought that deserved a toast.

1011
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:48,520
I don't know why you're
doing it, Danny.

1012
01:03:48,555 --> 01:03:51,120
I told you, it's because I love her.

1013
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,840
And your mother, she hates Italians.

1014
01:03:52,875 --> 01:03:54,720
- You know that.
- She got used to you.

1015
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:57,920
- Took her 15 years.
- And she'll get used to Theresa.

1016
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:00,200
Yeah, but she's gonna
miss you, Danny.

1017
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:03,000
I'm just getting married,
that's all.

1018
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:06,120
She's taking this fine.
She's handling it very well.

1019
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:08,960
- Oh she is, is she?
- Yes, she is.

1020
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,880
- Hello, Mrs. Muldoon.
- Oh, yeah right.

1021
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:13,640
- Hello, Sal.
- Jesus, Ma, what are you doing here?

1022
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:16,080
Oh, stop fussing.
I probably diapered half of them.

1023
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:18,000
- Come on.
- Why?

1024
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:19,920
- We have an appointment.
- With who?

1025
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:22,760
- The Polack priest.
- The Polack priest?

1026
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,640
- Why?
- We've got to settle our problems.

1027
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:28,560
Why can't this wait till later?

1028
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,640
Protestants and Jews go to
the psychiatrist.

1029
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:32,880
We go to the priest.

1030
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:35,280
You feel threatened by Theresa.

1031
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:37,600
- Threatened?
- Yes.

1032
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:39,800
See, she's taking up
a lot of Danny's time.

1033
01:04:39,835 --> 01:04:42,560
You're feeling threatened that
she's trying to steal your son.

1034
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,920
- What?
- Rose.

1035
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,840
I know you realize it's the '90s.

1036
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:49,200
I'm just not sure you
realize it's the 1990s.

1037
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:59,320
I've never been threatened
by anyone, ever!

1038
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:01,720
And I've been through
D-day, Korea, Vietnam...

1039
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,640
just relax.

1040
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:05,560
You see that?

1041
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,480
That's what I don't want to become.

1042
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,440
I don't want to be one
of those old ladies...

1043
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:12,040
who spends the rest of their
life standing in line.

1044
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:14,000
What do you mean, standing in line?

1045
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,920
They stand in line for
the confessional...

1046
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:19,120
every single day, even though
they have no sins to confess.

1047
01:05:19,155 --> 01:05:22,480
Just so they can blather with
the priest about Vatican II.

1048
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:25,040
And they stand in line
outside the movie theater...

1049
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:27,080
even though they've seen
the movie 10 times...

1050
01:05:27,115 --> 01:05:30,080
just so they can complain to
whoever's standing near them.

1051
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:32,000
About the price of the ticket.

1052
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:34,000
And they stand in line
at the grocery store...

1053
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:35,920
just so they can complain
to the cashier...

1054
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,840
about the price of frozen
string beans.

1055
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:41,320
Whether they should
be 29 or 39 cents.

1056
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:46,120
And do you know why they spend
so much time standing in line?

1057
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:47,520
No.

1058
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:49,440
Because there's nobody else...

1059
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,320
in the world they can talk to.

1060
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,680
- How's that look?
- It looks good.

1061
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:05,760
- Yeah? Feels all right.
- It looks real good.

1062
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,840
What do you think?
You like the style of this?

1063
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:09,680
Yeah, it's fine.

1064
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,680
Just fine? I thought
it looked pretty good.

1065
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:16,120
What's with you?

1066
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:18,040
You've been moping around all day.

1067
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:20,400
This is supposed to be fun.

1068
01:06:20,435 --> 01:06:22,400
Hey, could you guys give us
a minute? Thanks.

1069
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,320
- Look, Danny.
- Yeah?

1070
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:30,440
- I've been thinking.
- Yeah?

1071
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,160
Maybe... maybe this isn't
such a good idea.

1072
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:39,160
What's not a good idea?

1073
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,560
You know, this wedding thing.

1074
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,400
Maybe you're rushing into it.

1075
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,840
You just met her a little while ago,

1076
01:06:46,875 --> 01:06:48,760
maybe you should take a break.

1077
01:06:48,795 --> 01:06:51,120
Go to Florida with mom.

1078
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:53,760
Maybe you'll meet some
knockout in a bikini.

1079
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:56,440
Something wrong with Theresa?

1080
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:59,120
I didn't say that.
Did you hear me say that?

1081
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:01,000
There is nothing wrong with Theresa.

1082
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,920
She's just...

1083
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:05,800
just what?

1084
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,880
Well, she's a little plain.

1085
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:11,440
Oh, a little plain, huh?

1086
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:15,320
Yeah.

1087
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:17,240
And what's this? The cover of "gq?"

1088
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,160
Oh, this is hot, huh?

1089
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,080
Great look.
I'll buy next month's issue.

1090
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:24,160
- I just think you can do better.
- I don't think so.

1091
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:26,240
This is the girl. You got that?

1092
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,280
- She's the one.
- Dan, take it easy.

1093
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:30,440
Just being truthful.

1094
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,680
We're brothers, right? We're supposed
to be truthful with each other?

1095
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:36,640
- Don't give me this two-way lawyer crap.
- What's that mean?

1096
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:39,000
You couldn't give two shits
about me or Theresa.

1097
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:41,600
- All you care about is yourself.
- Hey, that is bullshit!

1098
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:44,520
Is it? You want me
to change my mind.

1099
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,440
You want me to go
to Florida and live with ma.

1100
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:49,720
- Then you wouldn't have to feel so guilty.
- Hey, Danny, come on...

1101
01:07:49,755 --> 01:07:51,920
forget it. This is my chance,
you understand?

1102
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:55,120
You took your chance. You got someone
to wake up with in the morning.

1103
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:56,400
You got a house full of kids.

1104
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,320
You got a train
around the christmas tree...

1105
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:00,520
and little ones
in halloween outfits.

1106
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:03,000
You want me to feel guilty
for wanting the same things?

1107
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:04,840
Fuck you!

1108
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:08,680
Listen to you. You go off
and get laid one time,

1109
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:11,560
and you think you're in love.
Come on!

1110
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,840
- Is he all right?
- It's all right. It's okay.

1111
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,760
Don't worry about it.
It's all right.

1112
01:08:20,795 --> 01:08:22,600
I'm a cop, it's okay. All right?

1113
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,120
Sorry, I didn't meant to hit you.

1114
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:30,320
The hell I didn't!
I meant to hit you.

1115
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:33,960
It's okay, I...

1116
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,240
I deserved it.
I was out of line.

1117
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:41,720
Look, Danny,
all I'm trying to say...

1118
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:45,440
is make sure that you're
in love with this girl.

1119
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:49,120
Make sure it's real.

1120
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:09,800
What's the matter with you today?

1121
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:11,720
You seem a little edgy.

1122
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,640
I'm fine.

1123
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:15,560
What is it?

1124
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,440
I'm fine.

1125
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:20,520
Really.

1126
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:24,080
Come on, Danny.

1127
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,880
I got a lot on my mind, okay?

1128
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:31,360
You can tell me.

1129
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:37,640
- It's just that...
- Yeah?

1130
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:43,720
Ever since my dad died
I've been in charge.

1131
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:48,160
Ma and Patrick,
they've depended on me.

1132
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:52,160
To be responsible.

1133
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:54,720
To take care of things,
and I have.

1134
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:57,000
I've always been there
for them when they needed me.

1135
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:01,360
Everything I've ever done,

1136
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:03,600
every decision I've ever
made was for them.

1137
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:09,880
I became a cop because ma wanted
Patrick to go to law school.

1138
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:13,680
She didn't have the extra money...

1139
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:16,040
so I came through.

1140
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:21,280
I'd do it again.
I'm not complaining.

1141
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,560
It's just that...

1142
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,280
well, now...

1143
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:34,480
you and me,

1144
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,160
it's the only time...

1145
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,160
the only time in my life...

1146
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:46,040
I've made a decision without
thinking of them first.

1147
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:53,480
And...

1148
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,560
I guess I'm a little scared.

1149
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:59,640
I'm afraid they're going to
think that I've abandoned them.

1150
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,200
I know that sounds stupid.

1151
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,080
I just don't want to lose my family.

1152
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,920
- Yeah, that's fine.
- There you go.

1153
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:32,160
Whoa, got beer behind you here.
Excuse me.

1154
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:33,760
Thank you, thank you.

1155
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:37,080
Hey, Joey, how's the stiff business?

1156
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,720
- Good to meet you.
- My wife.

1157
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:45,560
I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.

1158
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:50,080
Oh, yeah? Standing at the bar?

1159
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:53,720
Oh, yeah. Of course.

1160
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:02,320
All right.

1161
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:06,400
This is a very sad day
for myself and spats.

1162
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:09,480
We lose a valuable member...

1163
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:11,400
of our exclusive club,

1164
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:13,560
bachelorhood!

1165
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:24,760
Excuse me, I would
like to make a speech.

1166
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:27,240
But I would like to make
a speech in Greek.

1167
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:31,360
Who would understand
it but me?

1168
01:12:31,395 --> 01:12:34,200
But anyway, Danny, Theresa,

1169
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:38,640
to speak Greek, you only need three words.

1170
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:44,720
It means "I love you".

1171
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:58,560
Everybody, I'd like
to propose a toast.

1172
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:04,480
To my beautiful daughter
and her future husband.

1173
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:08,240
Tomorrow you'll be married.

1174
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:10,520
One little word of advice, okay?

1175
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,840
Let nothing come between you.

1176
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:17,160
- Salut!
- Salut!

1177
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:28,760
So, my son is getting married.

1178
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:32,640
And it seems that all of you
approve of his choice.

1179
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:36,480
But you haven't heard
my side of the story.

1180
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:39,640
I refuse...

1181
01:13:39,675 --> 01:13:41,560
and I repeat,

1182
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:43,960
I absolutely refuse...

1183
01:13:43,995 --> 01:13:46,600
to accept Theresa Luna
as my daughter-in-law.

1184
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,680
I will only accept her...

1185
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:59,280
as my daughter.

1186
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:03,080
Really?

1187
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:13,120
- Goodnight, Ma.
- Goodnight.

1188
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:15,280
- Had a great time.
- It was a wonderful evening.

1189
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:17,840
- Spats.
- Goodnight, now. Drive carefully.

1190
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:19,840
- Goodnight, Danny, Theresa.
- Goodnight.

1191
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:22,280
- Ma, I'm gonna take Theresa home.
- Fine.

1192
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:24,480
Rose, I'll drive you
over to the Irish village,

1193
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:26,960
- we'll talk a little treason.
- Thanks, but I'm tired.

1194
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,280
It's not even midnight.
I'll drive.

1195
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:31,200
Excuse me.

1196
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:35,200
Ma, do not get in the car with that
man tonight. He's been drinking.

1197
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:37,120
Don't worry, I'll go straight home.

1198
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:39,040
- You promise?
- I promise.

1199
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:40,960
- Goodnight, Ma.
- Goodnight, Danny.

1200
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,520
- My car's over here.
- I promised Danny I'd go straight home.

1201
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,440
- It's all right.
- No, I don't...

1202
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,640
It's a big night.
We should be celebrating!

1203
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:51,440
- No, I'm tired. I'd rather go home.
- Just one little drink.

1204
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:53,360
No, I don't want anything to drink.

1205
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:55,240
Aw, come on, Rose!

1206
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:58,720
We're driving to Niagara falls?

1207
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:00,960
Yeah, I thought that
would be a neat trip.

1208
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,320
We can't go to Niagara falls.
It's too cold.

1209
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:05,240
- No, it'll be fine.
- It's freezing.

1210
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:08,120
But then we're gonna go down to
New York city and see some shows.

1211
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:10,600
- Some Broadway shows?
- You can pick up some pointers.

1212
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:12,520
Wait, look. That's our wedding cake.

1213
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,440
Oh, wow, look at that.

1214
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:18,360
- This is ours?
- Yeah.

1215
01:15:18,395 --> 01:15:20,280
- Huh!
- It's pretty!

1216
01:15:20,315 --> 01:15:22,840
- This guy's good.
- Yeah, he's great.

1217
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:26,320
So pretty.

1218
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:28,200
I'm so excited about tomorrow.

1219
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:31,880
So happy.

1220
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,600
Rose, how about just one little drink?

1221
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:49,880
No, thanks, I don't
want anything to drink.

1222
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:52,240
Are you sure you're going
to be able to drive?

1223
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:54,160
Positive.

1224
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:06,560
My god, you're driving
all over the street!

1225
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,680
Look, I'm fine. Shut up!

1226
01:16:08,715 --> 01:16:10,800
Watch out where you're going!

1227
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:14,640
Oh my god!
You're driving down a one-way street!

1228
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:17,200
Wake up, wake up!

1229
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:22,280
Get your foot off the gas!

1230
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:25,000
Wake up, wake up!

1231
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:28,200
Oh, Daniel, I hope you
have a wonderful wedding!

1232
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:35,120
Danny?

1233
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:37,040
Danny, are you okay?

1234
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:39,360
Excuse me, I'll be
back in a moment.

1235
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:58,520
Ma? You're home.

1236
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:01,200
Good, I was just checking in
on you, that's all.

1237
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:02,760
I'll, uh,

1238
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:06,760
I'll see you later.
Okay, goodnight.

1239
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:18,080
What's wrong?

1240
01:17:18,115 --> 01:17:21,360
You called her the night
before our wedding?

1241
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:24,040
Yeah, I just wanted to make sure
she got home okay.

1242
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:27,000
I don't believe this.

1243
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:30,920
- What?
- Are we ever gonna be alone?

1244
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:34,200
What's that supposed to mean?

1245
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:36,080
Call her again.
It's been five minutes.

1246
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:38,280
Maybe she burned down the house,
fell down the stairs.

1247
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,080
- That's not funny.
- No, it's not funny.

1248
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:44,280
It's sad.

1249
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:48,080
It's sad that she's always in the back
of your mind making you feel guilty.

1250
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:50,520
It's like she has
some kind of hold on you.

1251
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:55,440
I honestly believed...

1252
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:57,880
that if we loved each other enough...

1253
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,120
maybe you could let her go.

1254
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:05,480
And what am I supposed to do?
Just forget about her?

1255
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:08,160
Slough her off?
Pretend she doesn't exist?

1256
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:10,120
No, just stop letting
her run your life.

1257
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:14,400
Be your own person,
your own man.

1258
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:20,640
And put us first.

1259
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:28,760
You can't,

1260
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:31,640
can you?

1261
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:37,040
I don't know.

1262
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:47,920
It's midnight. I better be going.

1263
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:52,120
It's bad luck to see
the bride after midnight.

1264
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:49,680
Here you go, Ma.

1265
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,960
You seen Danny yet or what?

1266
01:19:56,995 --> 01:19:58,880
He should be here by now.

1267
01:19:58,915 --> 01:20:01,400
Yeah, you would think so.

1268
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,680
Danny.

1269
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:12,560
Hi. Susan, is Theresa here yet?

1270
01:20:12,595 --> 01:20:16,360
- No.
- She didn't call or anything?

1271
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,240
No, not yet.

1272
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:45,080
Keep going.

1273
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:57,400
- Thanks, Mary.
- Bye, Danny.

1274
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:03,120
- Hi, Frank.
- Morning, Danny.

1275
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:06,600
- Hi, Clark.
- Morning, Danny.

1276
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:28,840
Me being your best friend and all,

1277
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:30,840
I'd like to know
what the hell happened.

1278
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:34,840
- Just forget it.
- It was your ma, wasn't it?

1279
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,720
- She made you call it off, didn't she?
- No.

1280
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,800
It wasn't a sexual problem, was it?

1281
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:42,960
- You can function as a man and all, right?
- Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

1282
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,240
It was her. What, does she want
to do it like a corpse?

1283
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:50,000
You know, I hear they're weird, these
people that work with the dead.

1284
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:51,920
- What is with you?
- What?

1285
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:54,440
Does everything in your life
have to relate to sex?

1286
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:57,600
Everything in life does relate
to sex. Think about it.

1287
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:00,880
Do you realize that 45% of these
people in these buildings...

1288
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:03,560
right now are having sex
of some sort?

1289
01:23:03,595 --> 01:23:05,200
That's a statistic, Danny.

1290
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:07,880
- Am I right?
- It's a fact.

1291
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:10,880
- It's a fact.
- What is with you? You're twisted.

1292
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:13,440
- What?
- What are you thinking? What's in your mind?

1293
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:16,440
You and your buddy Dr Ruth, back there.
I mean, come on!

1294
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:18,640
Oh, I can hardly wait to get to Florida.

1295
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:22,200
Maybe I'll find a partner who's got
more than a grape nut for a brain.

1296
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:34,680
- The usual?
- What do you suppose?

1297
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,200
Ah. Where's Doyle?

1298
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:42,400
Heart attack.

1299
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:44,440
What?

1300
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:46,920
They found him this morning.

1301
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:49,880
Passed away in his sleep last night.

1302
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:12,280
- Where's his family?
- What family?

1303
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:15,520
His mom died 15 years ago.

1304
01:24:15,555 --> 01:24:18,680
He's got a sister
in a nursing home.

1305
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:20,680
Never married. No kids.

1306
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:24,120
I guess we're it.

1307
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:41,000
Rose!

1308
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:44,040
Rose.

1309
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:45,920
Before you go I...

1310
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:19,960
we could have been great together.

1311
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:32,160
I'll go back in and see
if I forgot anything.

1312
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:40,080
Oh, go on.

1313
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:45,640
There we are. Wait here, okay?

1314
01:26:45,675 --> 01:26:47,800
I'm gonna go help Ma.

1315
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:56,200
Oh, do me a favor.
Give me the keys to your cruiser.

1316
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:58,120
Yeah. No problem, man.

1317
01:26:58,160 --> 01:26:59,960
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah.

1318
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:13,080
You know, Danny,

1319
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:15,800
I'm actually gonna miss this house.

1320
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:17,800
Yeah.

1321
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:22,400
Well, there's no point in getting
all teary-eyed about it.

1322
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:24,000
Get your bags. Come on, let's go.

1323
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:34,680
What's keeping you?
We'll miss the plane.

1324
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:40,160
- I'm not going with you, Ma.
- What?

1325
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:42,880
It hit me yesterday at the funeral.

1326
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:44,800
If I go with you to Florida,

1327
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:47,880
I'd be leaving behind the best
thing that ever happen to me.

1328
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:52,600
If it's not too late, I'm
gonna try to get her back.

1329
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:56,000
So, you're sending me
off to Florida alone?

1330
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:58,920
No. Ma, aunt Jean and uncle Walter,

1331
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:01,240
they're gonna meet you at the airport.

1332
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:04,120
Uncle Walter. He's always trying
to look under my skirt...

1333
01:28:04,155 --> 01:28:07,120
- when I cross my legs.
- Ma, come on, please.

1334
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:11,440
Very well.

1335
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:13,360
Fine.

1336
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:15,880
Who needs you anyway?

1337
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:17,600
Ma!

1338
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:19,720
Ma!

1339
01:28:19,755 --> 01:28:21,680
I'm an old woman.
I can't be expected...

1340
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:24,040
to wait on you hand and foot
for the rest of my life.

1341
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:25,960
I'm sick and tired
of doing your laundry,

1342
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,920
ironing your shirts,
cooking your meals.

1343
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:30,800
I've lost gallons of sweat
and buckets of blood.

1344
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:32,640
All for you.

1345
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:37,280
You've been nothing
but a ball and chain...

1346
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:40,360
of heartache and hurt.
Hanging around my neck...

1347
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:43,120
for too many god forsaken years.

1348
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:46,400
It'll be good riddance to you.

1349
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:08,160
- I'm sorry, Danny.
- That's okay, Ma.

1350
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:10,240
You were just telling it like it is.

1351
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:12,840
No, Danny.

1352
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:14,760
I was lying.

1353
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:18,280
Telling it like it is would
hurt too much right now.

1354
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:35,840
Go. Marry that girl.

1355
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:38,720
Have lots of Irish-dago mutts.

1356
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:41,080
And every once in a while
bring them to Florida...

1357
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,960
to see their grandmother.

1358
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:46,320
I love you, Ma.

1359
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,720
I'm not so loveable.

1360
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:53,520
True enough. I'm kidding.

1361
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:28,400
- Danny?
- Yeah.

1362
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:32,160
She's gone. New York, 3:15 train.

1363
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:34,320
Oh, damn.

1364
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:50,000
Lois, this is Danny Muldoon.

1365
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:52,560
- Yeah, Danny.
- Get me Freddy Nunzio at Union Station.

1366
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:54,480
- And hurry.
- 10-4.

1367
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:03,280
On behalf of Captain Anderson
and the entire crew,

1368
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:06,440
- we hope you have a very pleasant flight.
- Thank you.

1369
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:09,120
My name is Nora.
I'm the first flight attendant on...

1370
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:21,240
- Hey!
- Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

1371
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:26,280
What the hell are you doing here?

1372
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:28,520
Danny gave me his ticket.

1373
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:32,040
The thought of you traveling
to Florida all alone...

1374
01:31:32,075 --> 01:31:35,760
nearly broke my heart.
That's why I'm here.

1375
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:41,640
A kiss before take off?

1376
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:45,600
Forget it!

1377
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:47,560
I'm going to sleep!

1378
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:53,120
Well, at last we get
to sleep together.

1379
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:28,160
Folks, we have to make an
unscheduled stop here.

1380
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:30,720
There's gonna be a bit of a delay.

1381
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:34,880
For security reasons everyone will
have to deboard the train.

1382
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:37,680
We're sorry for the inconvenience.
Thank you.

1383
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:48,800
Theresa!

1384
01:32:58,360 --> 01:33:00,440
Hi.

1385
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:03,280
You did all this, didn't you?

1386
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:06,760
Sometimes it's good to be a cop.

1387
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:12,120
So what do you want?

1388
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:15,000
All aboard!

1389
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:17,520
I...

1390
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:19,640
I just wanna...

1391
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:21,440
I...

1392
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,760
don't you hate all the
uncomfortable stuff...

1393
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:28,600
that goes with trying to ask somebody
to get back together with you?

1394
01:33:28,635 --> 01:33:31,600
I'll make it easy for you.
I'll give you a list of excuses.

1395
01:33:31,635 --> 01:33:34,320
All you have to do is answer
yes or no. Okay?

1396
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:39,600
Good. Here goes.

1397
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:42,800
Reasons why you and i
can't get back together...

1398
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:45,760
- you're seeing somebody else.
- No.

1399
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:49,120
- You're moving into a convent.
- No.

1400
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:51,400
You're having your legs waxed?

1401
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:53,720
No.

1402
01:33:58,280 --> 01:34:00,440
You've fallen out of love with me?

1403
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:04,400
No.

1404
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:10,520
- No?
- No.

1405
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:15,000
That's great.

1406
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:18,760
Maybe you and me,

1407
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:20,840
- we should...
- You forgot one thing.

1408
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:24,640
- What?
- Your mother.

1409
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:27,080
She's gone.

1410
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:29,600
- To Florida?
- She's on a plane.

1411
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:33,920
So how do I know you won't hop
a flight to be with her...

1412
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:35,920
tomorrow or next week
or next month?

1413
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:38,960
Because I'm the one who let her go.

1414
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:44,200
And I'm ready to put us first.

1415
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:49,120
Final boarding call for all passengers...

1416
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:51,520
traveling to New York city.

1417
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:53,760
- Come on.
- Where?

1418
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:55,680
Well we're boarding.

1419
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:58,880
- You're going to New York?
- I know this police sergeant in the Bronx.

1420
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:01,680
He transferred from Chicago.
Maybe he can pull a few strings.

1421
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:04,160
Get me a line on a job.

1422
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:07,560
You'd do that? You'd leave everything
behind just to be with me?

1423
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:09,480
Yeah.

1424
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:11,320
I love you.

1425
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:17,080
I love you too.

1426
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:55,080
To our homeland or we will all die!

1427
01:35:55,120 --> 01:35:58,560
Nobody move!

1428
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:09,080
Rose!

1429
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:39,480
Danny, relax.

1430
01:36:39,515 --> 01:36:41,840
I can take care of myself.

1431
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:48,840
Is everything okay?

1432
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:52,320
Couldn't be better. Come on.
