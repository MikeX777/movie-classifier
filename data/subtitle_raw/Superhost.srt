00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:58,013
Do I look at you,
or at the camera?

538
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:03,059
Just look at me.

539
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,228
I'm not even here.

540
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,646
- Look at you.
- Yeah.

541
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,316
Got it.

542
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:11,359
Alright, Rebecca,
we're gonna start off

543
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:15,071
with a friendly introduction,
sort of like a,

544
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:18,241
"hi, my name is Rebecca,
and I'm a superhost."

545
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:22,162
If you could say something like
that that'd be great.

546
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:26,833
Hi. My name is Rebecca,
and I'm a superhost.

547
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,794
Teddy: Awesome. And that smile
at the end was perfect.

548
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:32,797
Okay, so, we're gonna get into
the real questions now.

549
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:35,717
And I'm not on camera.
You can't hear or see me.

550
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:38,178
If you can incorporate
the question into the answers.

551
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:40,722
Let's say I'm asking you,
"what color is your shirt?"

552
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,432
Instead of saying "red,"
you would say,

553
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,768
"the color of my shirt is red."

554
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:47,854
- Make sense?
- But my shirt is white.

555
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,023
Yeah. So, then, you would say,

556
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,025
"the color of my shirt
is white."

557
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,026
Right?

558
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,487
Yeah. I think so.

559
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:58,448
Teddy: Okay.
Let's... let's get going.

560
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:02,118
So, Rebecca, how did you
decide to get into

561
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:04,120
renting out your house?

562
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:07,957
For starters,
this isn't really my house.

563
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:10,794
My father left it to me
when he died.

564
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:14,547
He owned it with my step-mom,
and when he passed,

565
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,633
she got his house
in south Carolina,

566
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:18,385
and I got this one.

567
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:21,012
Oh, wow. I'm...

568
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,764
So sorry to hear that.

569
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,575
But it must be nice
to have a place like this

570
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,725
to remember him by.

571
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,727
Yeah, it's great.

572
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,532
I have a smaller place
not far from here...

573
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:31,356
Much smaller...

574
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:34,275
So I'm able to
keep an eye on it.

575
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:37,529
But... it felt wrong
to keep it empty.

576
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:40,865
So, when all of these
vacation home sharing websites

577
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:44,411
started popping up, I signed up.

578
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:45,745
Here we are.

579
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,539
Teddy: That's great.

580
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:50,333
Any particular experiences
with the rental

581
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,877
that you'd like to share?

582
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,796
You know, maybe someone
that has stayed,

583
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:57,173
and left a memorable
impression on you?

584
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,008
Yeah.

585
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:01,219
You know what?

586
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,887
There was this one.

587
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:16,317
An older couple.

588
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:20,238
They rented the place for
an entire month over Christmas.

589
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,031
They saw that
I was living alone,

590
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:25,076
and all of their kids had kids

591
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:27,036
and did their own thing
for the holidays.

592
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:29,205
So, they invited me in.

593
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,666
And we spent
the holidays together.

594
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:36,463
Christmas, new year's,
I was here with them.

595
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:38,882
It was nice.

596
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:40,967
It was like I was their family.

597
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,157
Re... re...

598
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:07,494
It is the best holiday
I ever had.

599
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,454
They live back
in south Carolina,

600
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:10,830
but are just...

601
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:15,293
The nicest people.

602
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,510
I think... I think that's great.

603
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:26,888
Awesome job.

604
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:31,100
Oh, if we could get
one final line.

605
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,393
Of course.

606
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:34,270
Yeah, this is just a signoff.

607
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:36,815
If you can say, "hi,
my name is Rebecca,"

608
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,901
pause, and then,
with the most enthusiasm

609
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:42,278
that you can,
finish it off with, you know,

610
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,197
"I am a superhost.

611
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,743
Hi. My name is Rebecca.

612
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:54,624
And I am a superhost!

613
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:59,546
Hi. My name is Rebecca.

614
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:06,094
And I am a superhost!

615
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:11,307
That is the craziest shit
I've ever seen.

616
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:12,767
I knew when we got here.

617
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,394
Teddy: What do you mean?

618
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,813
This is what people want to see.

619
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:20,441
They want to see people
like that... complete lunatics.

620
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,903
[Sighs]

621
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:28,199
We got to get more of her.

622
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:35,874
This chick is gold.

623
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:37,917
Let's watch it again.

624
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,587
Rebecca: Hi. My name is Rebecca.

625
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,633
And I am a superhost!

626
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,807
What's up, guys.

627
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:55,119
Claire's sleeping right now,
and we have a brand-new episode

628
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:56,561
that's slowly uploading.

629
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:58,688
But I wanted to record
a quick update

630
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,649
on the super top secret
proposal video.

631
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,359
Also, you should hit
that "like" button.

632
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,653
Don't forget to subscribe.

633
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:08,865
So, in the morning,
I'm gonna take her up the hill.

634
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:13,578
And the view is supposed
to be spectacular.

635
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:15,204
That's where I'm gonna do it.

636
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,460
I thought I heard her.

637
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:23,671
Anyway, just wanted to give you
a quick update.

638
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,524
I can't wait to see her face
when she finds out

639
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,508
why we really came out here.

640
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:29,510
I should get going.
She's a light sleeper.

641
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:31,638
But I'll see you guys tomorrow.

642
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:40,021
[Chimes ringing]

643
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:44,252
So, Teddy thought it would be
a great idea

644
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:45,586
to wake up bright and early

645
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:48,339
to go walking in
the middle of nowhere.

646
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:51,217
To make matters worse, our
upload didn't work last night.

647
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,552
It seems the Internet is down,

648
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:54,554
so who knows if
you'll ever see it.

649
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,973
Yes, but I did write to Rebecca
this morning,

650
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:58,575
and it should be fixed
by the time we get back.

651
00:41:58,599 --> 00:41:59,726
Yeah, we'll see about that.

652
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:02,270
Speaking of Rebecca,

653
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:04,772
I don't think I have ever
seen anything as crazy

654
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,607
as what we witnessed yesterday.

655
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:08,502
We're gonna have to shoot some
kind of reenactment for you,

656
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:12,822
but basically, she nearly beat
the crap out of that bitch Vera.

657
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,240
Remember her?

658
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,492
Yeah, well,
she drove all the way here,

659
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:18,786
shows up out of nowhere,
all huffing and puffing.

660
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:20,597
- Come on. Let's do this after.
- One second.

661
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:24,208
That's right...
The bitch from draper came here,

662
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,335
and threw a rock at a window.

663
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:29,714
I mean, we went out there, and
she legit wanted to fight me.

664
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,439
- Claire.
- And then, Rebecca, this host,

665
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:33,426
comes out of nowhere,
goes fully crazy,

666
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,845
and that bitch just
hightails it out of here.

667
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,473
Claire, come on.

668
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:39,891
Fine.

669
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:41,642
Party pooper.

670
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:51,319
[ Breathing heavily]

671
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:53,905
[Sighs]

672
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,871
- Wow.
- Yeah.

673
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:06,959
Okay.

674
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:11,172
Check out this view
we have here.

675
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:13,341
This is unbelievable.

676
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:15,843
Teddy: Hey, can we just...

677
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:18,387
Stop for a moment?

678
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:19,680
Here.

679
00:43:19,806 --> 00:43:21,808
Why don't you want to film?

680
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:23,976
I do.

681
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:29,816
Claire: What are you doing?

682
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:32,026
Teddy: I just...

683
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,281
I just want to look at you
for a moment.

684
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:39,367
What?

685
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:43,204
I know how stressed
you've been lately,

686
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:46,290
and I just want to take
a minute to...

687
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:49,502
Tell you just how much
I appreciate you.

688
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:53,047
- Teddy, I...
- Just... one moment.

689
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,678
So, I've been thinking.

690
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:00,221
That's never good.

691
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:01,639
I've been thinking

692
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:04,684
that you and I have been
doing this show

693
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:06,394
for a while now.

694
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:09,438
And we've been together
even longer than that.

695
00:44:09,564 --> 00:44:14,360
And we do everything together...

696
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:17,405
Everything.

697
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:21,909
And I just want to continue
doing everything together...

698
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:26,038
The show... life...

699
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:28,124
Everything.

700
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:31,878
Teddy...

701
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:37,258
Teddy: So, I spoke with your
parents last week.

702
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:39,302
You did?

703
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:40,553
Yeah.

704
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,763
Your dad told me a long time ago

705
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:45,099
that I had to talk to him
before I got any ideas.

706
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:46,934
So I did.

707
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:48,227
I talked to your mom and dad,

708
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:53,733
and I asked them
if this was okay.

709
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:57,028
Claire...

710
00:44:57,153 --> 00:44:59,780
Will you marry me?

711
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:01,490
Yes! Of course!

712
00:45:05,578 --> 00:45:07,997
Teddy, you're a genius.

713
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,957
- What do you mean?
