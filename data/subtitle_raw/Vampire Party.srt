1
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:44,811
Around the country,
temperatures are above average.

2
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:46,813
We expect 27 degrees Celsius in Lyon,

3
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:49,817
19 degrees in Bethune,
31 degrees in Cagnes-sur-Mer,

4
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,215
23 degrees in Dunkirk.

5
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:56,485
Violent storms are expected...

6
00:00:56,523 --> 00:01:00,619
The following strange story
is that of Sam Polisatokoniminsky.

7
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:05,428
Sam's a normal guy, Capricorn,
size 9 shoes.

8
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,797
But he has an idiosyncrasy:

9
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:09,893
He's a confirmed party animal.

10
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:13,373
Night after night, Sam parties...
a friend's birthday party...

11
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:14,897
A shower gel launch...

12
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:17,570
A restaurant opening...
An IBM farewell bash...

13
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:23,709
Sam can smell a cocktail
even with a bad cold and in a storm.

14
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:28,387
Sam never parties without Alice,
his friend from high school

15
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,288
and physical education.

16
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:32,088
She's forgotten Phys Ed

17
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:36,426
to concentrate on her physique
and teach aerobics.

18
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:39,296
Day after day,
creating a dreamy silhouette,

19
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:42,769
dynamite legs, pert little breasts,

20
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:48,401
luscious thighs, and tight,
Burkina Faso coconut buns!

21
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,876
Hello?

22
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:53,847
Mom! Of course I'm coming Sunday
with the meringues.

23
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,178
Gotta go. I'm at work. Big hug.

24
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:57,706
Where was I? Oh, yes...

25
00:01:57,751 --> 00:02:02,450
Guys like Alice. As you can see,
they love her classes.

26
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:06,756
As a result, Alice accumulates
love affairs that all end...

27
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,090
Badly!

28
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,830
Let's take a break.

29
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,102
Hello?

30
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,537
Alice, it's Sam.

31
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:20,563
Hi, Sam.

32
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:23,440
- What's going on tonight? Any ideas?
- Not tonight.

33
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,969
Prune's lined up a cool bash.

34
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:28,812
By "cool," I mean open bar.
No big deal.

35
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:31,079
Any chance I can come?

36
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:33,815
- Maybe after?
- I'm seeing Alban afterward.

37
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:38,348
Listen, I must get back to work.

38
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:40,952
Let's go, guys.

39
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,155
That's it, yeah!

40
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:54,967
When it comes to parties,
there's Prune.

41
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,375
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:59,209
They met in high school.

43
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:04,878
But it was at the Stardust
that Prune won Sam's eternal devotion.

44
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:07,649
She makes the best Daiquiri in the world.

45
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:12,387
But the gift is a secret.
Today, Prune works at a bank.

46
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:15,657
Though Prune loves her job,
she hasn't stopped partying.

47
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:20,031
Only through professionalism
can she combine them perfectly.

48
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:23,264
One could say that, over time,
she's become an expert.

49
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:24,896
Hello?

50
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:33,411
It's the hospital.
My father's had a terrible pony accident.

51
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:35,472
He's at death's door.

52
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,581
Shit, Sam!
I said not to call me at work.

53
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:46,187
Last time my aunt was dying.
Today it's my dad.

54
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,752
If this continues, I'll be an orphan.

55
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:52,026
Is there a party tonight?
Alice said there was.

56
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,159
We only get to go because we're girls.

57
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:59,736
Fine, I get it.
I'll manage on my own.

58
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:01,605
Right. Ciao.

59
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:05,077
That moment sealed the fate
of our three friends.

60
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:09,106
Sam could have skipped this night
and avoided the trouble that ensued.

61
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:13,017
But nobody stops Sam Polisatokoniminsky
from going to a party.

62
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:14,316
Nobody!

63
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:13,669
VAMPIRE PARTY

64
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:43,092
How are you?

65
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,604
Not good.

66
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:47,039
What happened?

67
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,064
It's all over with Alban.

68
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:51,043
The asshole dumped me!

69
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:54,479
- And you were in love with him?
- Madly.

70
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:57,575
We met at an aerobics competition
in St. Leu.

71
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,608
We chose the same choreography...

72
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,857
We were connected!

73
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,121
Definitely.

74
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,563
I'll be like you. You're always alone,
never with anyone.

75
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,363
In the end, you're happier than me.

76
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:17,769
- Definitely.
- Surprise!

77
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:25,070
Well, girls, no bouncer
was gonna keep me out.

78
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,738
You don't look so hot!

79
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:31,813
I'm going to dance.

80
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:41,118
What did he say?
Did he say why?

81
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:43,562
Well, he said I'm...

82
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,928
He said I'm a nice girl.

83
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,526
In other words, a pain.

84
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:52,568
Am I a pain?

85
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:59,944
No! You're decent, balanced,
responsible, hard-working...

86
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,108
A pain, in other words.

87
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,090
If this goes on, I'll end it all.

88
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,059
But the sales are in three weeks!

89
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:16,756
- Really?
- Yes!

90
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:22,496
Hey, Sam, how would you describe Alice?

91
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:25,004
You're a nice girl.

92
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,235
I need a tissue.

93
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:58,834
I don't know what cad hurt you.
Your tears must be dried.

94
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:06,542
Thank you.

95
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:08,445
Here...

96
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,081
It's a party my friends are giving soon.

97
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:16,953
I'd be very happy to see you there.

98
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,721
You'll soon forget Alban.

99
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:27,461
Who?

100
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,264
- Holy shit!
- What?

101
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:30,736
You hit the jackpot.

102
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:35,367
- Medici Night.
- First invite I've seen.

103
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,775
Have you heard of it?

104
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:40,974
It's an urban legend.

105
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:44,575
We've all heard of it,
but no one's been invited.

106
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:47,712
Your invite's worth a fortune.

107
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:52,419
See? I told you.
And he's just invited you!

108
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:56,555
Gentlemen don't like seeing
a lady cry, that's all.

109
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,827
Have you still got your pepper spray?

110
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,978
Who's the boss?

111
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,414
- Great!
- It worked?

112
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,442
- Your tears upset him?
- He didn't give a shit.

113
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:22,979
I stole them from his jacket.

114
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,586
Medici Night. Shit!

115
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,153
Medici Night!

116
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:34,758
I see you studied at Princeton University.

117
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,132
Very good résumé.

118
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:39,161
English, German, Spanish, Chinese...

119
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,969
- You'll go far.
- Thank you, Sir.

120
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:43,738
First, go get me some coffee.

121
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:47,110
Espresso. No sugar. Many thanks.

122
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:02,718
Journiac?!

123
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,527
I hope I've not come at a bad time.

124
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:15,509
Impressive office, Lefranc.

125
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:18,671
Your new job seems to suit you well.

126
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,009
Tell me what you want.

127
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,574
I've come to help you.

128
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:30,613
I imagine it must be torment for a man
of your standing to be indebted to us.

129
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:41,658
You'll finally show us your gratitude
for putting you here.

130
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,762
It's an invitation to a party.

131
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:49,107
Be there, Lefranc. Without fail.

132
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:52,601
Don't give me gray hairs
from worrying about you.

133
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,101
Is the secret mystery party here?

134
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:25,941
No, but apparently,
we leave from here. Look.

135
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:29,040
Think we're going by helicopter?

136
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,210
Great!

137
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:34,812
Excuse me. Good evening.
Sorry to bother you...

138
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,618
I bought my invitation on eBay...

139
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:40,024
I was looking for a fondue set, actually.

140
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,858
I love it, and my grandmother's
from Chambery...

141
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:45,887
That's how I got my invitation on eBay.

142
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:49,425
I'm alone, so would you mind
if we went together?

143
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,130
No, not at all.

144
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,002
Cool! Time for a photo.

145
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,407
Ready? There you go!

146
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,705
My name's Edouard.

147
00:12:57,744 --> 00:12:59,610
Prune. Delighted.

148
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,580
- Sam.
- Delighted.

149
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,139
Alice.

150
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:33,037
Oh, I get it, you sell souvenir photos
after the party.

151
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:35,605
Not at all.
Photography's just a hobby.

152
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,743
Before, it was hand-painted
clown figurines.

153
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:42,221
The biggest collection in all Europe.

154
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:44,753
Goodbye.

155
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:47,182
Mrs. Conti?

156
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:50,491
That's enough, George.
Stop following me!

157
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,089
I'm going to this party.

158
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,463
Listen, Mrs. Conti...

159
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,868
Call Carlos.
Tell him I don't need a bodyguard!

160
00:13:57,904 --> 00:14:00,532
Sorry, Madam.
I can't let you run any risks.

161
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:03,975
With my heels,
I won't be running anywhere!

162
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:07,971
May I?

163
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,880
Good evening.

164
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,078
- Serge Krinine.
- Delighted.

165
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:17,447
I'm a dentist. Dental surgeon.
I mean, stomatologist.

166
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:22,428
In fact, I'm also an orthodontist
and prosthetist. But I'm oversimplifying.

167
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:24,988
- Do you know the difference?
- No.

168
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,123
I'll explain.

169
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:29,533
In dentistry,
there's a host of disciplines.

170
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:31,936
Each one is a specialty in itself.

171
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:40,270
Where are we going?

172
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:42,372
Who cares? That's the magic.

173
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:46,010
Just go with the flow!

174
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:51,547
Common facial dysmorphoses
are prognathism, or protruding jaw,

175
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:55,118
and retrognathism,
or the jaw goes too far back.

176
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:57,596
Another malformation often encountered:

177
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,895
the cleft palate,
commonly called "harelip."

178
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,037
Talk about international class!

179
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,043
- Look over there!
- Where?

180
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:14,707
There, the castle.
That's where we're going.

181
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:20,175
Then the anesthetist said,

182
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:27,421
"Serge, stop immediately,
or I'll give him some Rhinopal 200...

183
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,656
Instead of Niposilium."

184
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:37,328
We sure laughed!

185
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,844
Who's hosting? Martha Stewart?

186
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,313
This had better be good.
Imagine trying to get a taxi...

187
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:00,222
Damn, this is no joke.

188
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,193
- Shit!
- What?

189
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:04,390
- I can't find my invitation.
- That's dumb.

190
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:08,060
I must have left it in the helicopter.
See you inside, OK?

191
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,831
- Super.
- See you!

192
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:17,366
Wait!

193
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:19,341
Good evening.

194
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:22,905
- Your name, please?
- Krinine. Serge Krinine.

195
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:24,439
Serge Krinine?

196
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:29,888
I'll tell the Duke that you're here.
He adores you, as do I.

197
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,617
Have a nice evening, Mr. Krinine.

198
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:36,493
I hope you'll have a moment to tell me
how one becomes the star of dentists.

199
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,865
Want to know how I did it?

200
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:43,391
With pleasure.

201
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:47,100
A good dentist must always give
oral pleasure.

202
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,600
See you tomorrow.
Wait for me here.

203
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:53,078
And get me some croissants.

204
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:57,174
Mr. Carlos won't be happy, Mrs. Conti.

205
00:16:57,216 --> 00:17:00,982
I watch my figure all year.
One croissant won't make me fat.

206
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,251
- Your name, please.
- Jessica Conti.

207
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,349
The party awaits you.

208
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:09,418
Oh, you could have started without me.

209
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:11,328
Have a good evening, Mrs. Conti.

210
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,854
Thanks.

211
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:14,799
Mrs. Conti?

212
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:20,238
So far, Carlos' money has been enough,
but from here, you'll need an invitation.

213
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:21,468
Bye, Georges.

214
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:27,237
I'll be back.

215
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:35,543
Good evening, Sir.
Invitation, please.

216
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:40,482
Thank you.

217
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:44,248
That's fine. You can park.

218
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,451
My invitation!

219
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:49,361
Don't you understand?

220
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:51,159
Stupid!

221
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:55,532
Let's speak the universal language.
Understand this?

222
00:18:58,437 --> 00:18:59,905
A Beretta 92.

223
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:04,740
That's funny.
I have the same one at home. I love it.

224
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:06,677
Italian manufacture.

225
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:08,874
12 round clip.

226
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:12,179
9 mm... Light, precise.

227
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:21,155
Sir? You okay?

228
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:30,767
Mr. Carlos? I've got an invitation.

229
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:42,612
I'm going to look around.

230
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:48,383
Good evening, Sir.

231
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:50,287
Good evening.

232
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:53,856
Sir?

233
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:56,756
The VIP entrance is that way.

234
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:00,090
Have a good evening, Sir.

235
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,267
Your pin.

236
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:29,188
I don't know about you,
but I adore reggae.

237
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:12,499
Maybe my Prince Charming is here.

238
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:14,370
Haven't you given up on guys?

239
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:16,374
A leopard can't change its spots.

240
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:18,103
When do we meet yours?

241
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:19,270
I'm waiting for him.

242
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:22,303
He'll show up with a rose
between his teeth.

243
00:21:28,254 --> 00:21:29,949
Want one?

244
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:32,390
I just cased the joint.

245
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:36,918
A babe told me
that it's really cool up there!

246
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,226
Go for it!

247
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:15,924
Dear brothers, dear sisters.

248
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:19,598
It gives me immense pleasure
to welcome you this evening.

249
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:23,336
All these faces, so familiar to me.

250
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:28,108
Never, dear friends, has our community been
so strong and prosperous.

251
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:34,416
We are everywhere, from politicians
to shampooers, big bosses to hairstylists.

252
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:39,584
Every day, new names join the long list
in the Book of Pacts.

253
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:43,823
In truth, I'm telling you,
and I won't split hairs,

254
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:49,063
the day we reign supreme on Earth is nigh!

255
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:59,038
Meanwhile, let's enjoy the festivities!

256
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:44,319
Open bar!

257
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:55,064
Hey, you forget to return my invitation?

258
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:18,113
Your Lordship.

259
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:25,063
- Yes?
- Lefranc has arrived.

260
00:24:25,097 --> 00:24:26,963
Good.

261
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:30,731
Put him in my apartment,
and make sure he stays put.

262
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:33,136
See that he's treated with consideration.

263
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:35,641
Take him up and make him comfortable.

264
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:49,084
Good evening.

265
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:52,147
My name's Serge Krinine.

266
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:55,559
I'm a dentist.
I mean, a dental surgeon.

267
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:57,289
Stomatologist...

268
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:01,266
I'm really an orthodontist,
but that's oversimplifying.

269
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:05,669
I don't know if you know
the different disciplines.

270
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:25,080
Sorry, Sir.
The upstairs is for VIPs.

271
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:28,583
Who are VIPs?
Someone with one of those?

272
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:31,028
Among other things.

273
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,296
I'll go and find some pins.

274
00:25:37,336 --> 00:25:39,304
Come on. We're VIPs.

275
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:40,464
Sorry.

276
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,934
Well, he's a barrel of laughs!

277
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:45,705
I guess it's not negotiable.

278
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:47,872
Wait for me, I'll be back.

279
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:20,243
Dig in!

280
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:39,560
Sam, stop pressing your beer bottle
into my back.

281
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,589
Stop it!

282
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:43,932
Good evening.

283
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:45,562
Good evening.

284
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:48,073
I didn't think you'd come.

285
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,235
I'm really happy you're here.

286
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,642
I can see that.

287
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:54,669
A glass of champagne?

288
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:56,772
Thanks. I'd love one.

289
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:15,693
Good evening.

290
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:17,896
I was watching you.

291
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:21,133
So serious.
What are you thinking about?

292
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:25,269
The consequences of global warming.

293
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,871
Did you know that
when a bit of an iceberg falls off,

294
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:31,576
a family of polar bears can go with it?

295
00:27:31,617 --> 00:27:33,210
Imagine that.

296
00:27:33,252 --> 00:27:34,742
I find it horrid.

297
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:36,754
You're lovely when you're sad.

298
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:42,220
You have great bones.

299
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:45,322
Great buns?

300
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:48,026
Great bones.

301
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:50,592
- Are you foreign?
- No. Why?

302
00:27:50,636 --> 00:27:52,798
With your accent, I thought...

303
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:06,908
A Bloody Mary, please.

304
00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:10,619
Krinine?

305
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:12,715
Serge Krinine?

306
00:28:12,758 --> 00:28:15,989
- Bingo!
- Michel Shaffner.

307
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:19,396
I noticed you immediately.
In our game, you're a celebrity.

308
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:20,865
Are you in prostheses?

309
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:24,301
No, but I know all your work.

310
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:27,499
I'm a big fan.
Alain Delon's maxillofacial work?

311
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,906
Elton John's premolars?

312
00:28:29,942 --> 00:28:32,877
The idea of gap teeth to launch
Beatrice Dalle?

313
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:34,504
Magnificent!

314
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,379
It's funny.
You're my second fan tonight.

315
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:39,407
You've got many fans tonight.

316
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:42,352
In our line, we're all into teeth.

317
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,220
What's your line?
Explain it to me.

318
00:28:45,257 --> 00:28:47,555
You all work for Colgate?

319
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:50,824
It's a denture convention?

320
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:52,956
You're related to Dracula?

321
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:58,230
Dracula? No, that's the competition.
Quite different.

322
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,298
We're out of Bloody Mary.
Try a Bloody Chantal.

323
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:03,809
That'd be perfect.

324
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:11,481
Have a good evening.

325
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:30,901
That was so good.

326
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:33,098
I couldn't wait.

327
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:36,164
I really wanted to suck him.

328
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:39,269
I just sucked him up.
Got every drop.

329
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:40,369
May I?

330
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,608
I've had my fill.

331
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:47,882
And that's the fifth one
I've sucked tonight. I've had it.

332
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,944
Have a good evening.

333
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:52,821
The fifth...

334
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,381
- How many are at the bar?
- About 400.

335
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:53,543
400?

336
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:55,519
How will you make them disappear?

337
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:57,022
We've chartered a plane.

338
00:30:57,055 --> 00:31:00,787
Let's just say it'll take off,
but it won't arrive.

339
00:31:00,826 --> 00:31:03,693
Who'll swallow an accident story?

340
00:31:03,729 --> 00:31:07,029
That's why we need you.

341
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:09,261
Step this way.

342
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:15,196
Your jacket, please.

343
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,507
The Duke wants to ensure that you stay.

344
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:22,809
It'd be a pity if one of us thought
you were the buffet.

345
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:32,921
What are you afraid of?

346
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:36,952
You'll be fine as long as you stay
in this room.

347
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:38,622
Here.

348
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:42,032
Put these on, and we'll say no more.

349
00:31:49,808 --> 00:31:52,470
You seem to be used to handcuffs.

350
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:55,139
I remind you that
I'm the county's number-one cop.

351
00:31:55,180 --> 00:32:00,448
What about nipple clamps?
Do you like them with handcuffs?

352
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:11,955
Look at his neck.

353
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:18,229
See that?

354
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:21,333
Shit...

355
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:23,068
What the hell is this?

356
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:27,272
Let's find Alice and get out of here.

357
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:38,149
I just had some Chinese...

358
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:41,216
And I'm having trouble digesting him.

359
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:56,698
Hey, guys! I found my invitation.

360
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:58,971
I'm so happy to...

361
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,069
To see you again...

362
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:03,171
Wait, I want to dance, too!

363
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:05,650
Meet me on the stairs.

364
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:09,386
Don't ask. We're going. It's creepy!

365
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,638
My, is it warm in here.

366
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,905
Mind if I get comfy?

367
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:36,437
This floor heating is so suffocating.

368
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:38,575
My goodness.

369
00:33:38,617 --> 00:33:43,077
You must be dying in those pants.
Aren't you?

370
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:46,955
The Duke said to make you comfy,
so I'll do my job.

371
00:33:46,992 --> 00:33:48,619
Don't touch me! I'm fine!

372
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:52,062
You know the Duke.
An order's an order!

373
00:33:52,097 --> 00:33:54,464
He said to make you comfortable.

374
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:57,298
- What are you doing?
- Making you comfy.

375
00:33:57,335 --> 00:34:01,932
Do you know what's great
when you're really hot?

376
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:04,408
Ice on the pubis.

377
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:08,072
You're in luck. We've got some.
I'll be back.

378
00:34:08,113 --> 00:34:12,482
Meanwhile, I'll slip into
something more attractive.

379
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:18,217
I'm not hot. I'm not hot!

380
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:19,849
I'm not hot at all!

381
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,985
You're nuts, wanting to dance in here.

382
00:34:22,027 --> 00:34:23,927
We want an exit. Get in.

383
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:28,924
Sorry.

384
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:32,962
Shit!

385
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:35,268
What is all this?

386
00:34:36,942 --> 00:34:40,378
Why don't we go back and dance?
There's some good music.

387
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:43,746
- You're no fun!
- What are these clothes?

388
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:45,147
How do you explain that?

389
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:48,881
Why are our coats in trash bags?
Weird.

390
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:54,552
Dear friends, it simply means our hosts
don't plan on letting us leave here alive.

391
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:57,722
What do you mean? Who are you?
Why are you here?

392
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,230
Like you, I'm hiding.

393
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:03,360
I'm delaying the final crunch.
Petit-four?

394
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:05,335
Is there sugar in it?

395
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,134
I'll call the cops.

396
00:35:07,172 --> 00:35:09,402
I tried already.
Cell phones don't work.

397
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:11,705
No signal.
They must be scrambling it.

398
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:16,741
Alice! I found you at last.

399
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:17,942
Come and dance.

400
00:35:17,983 --> 00:35:20,577
No, thanks, but she doesn't want to.

401
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,853
Stop, you're wrinkling my shirt!

402
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:36,533
Why do I always get the crazies?

403
00:35:36,568 --> 00:35:39,265
Come on, there are lots of other girls.

404
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:42,137
But your blood is O Negative.

405
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:43,868
It's so rare.

406
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:47,776
In the club that night, right away
I smelled a nose of red fruits

407
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,906
and notes of vanilla.

408
00:35:49,948 --> 00:35:51,040
That was deodorant.

409
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:53,608
And in the mouth a roundness, softness.

410
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:55,882
Lingering on the palate.

411
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,480
Time for a slow dance, Alice!

412
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:09,125
Do you think he's dead?

413
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:12,296
Pity. He seemed nice
without that wolf-head.

414
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:15,967
- We're in deep shit.
- Wait...

415
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,772
Let me think for a minute.

416
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:37,055
I've got it.

417
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:40,087
We snag his pin and go upstairs.

418
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:43,328
No. The bouncer saw us without pins.

419
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:44,802
Oh, yeah. Shit!

420
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:46,326
How about you?

421
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:50,035
No, I'm a star here. Krinine.
Serge Krinine.

422
00:36:50,075 --> 00:36:53,375
Dentist, dental surgeon,
stomato-prosthetist.

423
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:55,140
Believe me, they love me here.

424
00:37:06,925 --> 00:37:08,757
Good evening.

425
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:14,027
I'm taking some friends upstairs
to enjoy ourselves in peace and quiet.

426
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,557
Of course. Have a nice evening.

427
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:20,902
Cute, don't you think?

428
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:22,998
Cute enough to eat.

429
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:25,840
Good evening.

430
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:34,216
At first, I liked Carlos being a gangster.

431
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:37,017
Lawlessness excited me terrifically.

432
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:39,854
Bank raids? Drugs? Hold-ups?

433
00:37:39,891 --> 00:37:41,052
No, not at all.

434
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:44,892
In fact, he sold
expired sausages illegally.

435
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,727
How disappointing for you.

436
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:49,427
Terribly...

437
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:52,994
I adore sausages.

438
00:37:56,374 --> 00:38:01,813
Lately, for a few weeks now,
it's been worse. He doesn't...

439
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:05,111
Fulfill his conjugal duties?

440
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,778
Who knows?
I don't handle his paperwork.

441
00:38:07,819 --> 00:38:10,914
In any case,
he doesn't touch me anymore.

442
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,890
I need to feel a man's body.

443
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:17,327
His skin, his warmth, his gentleness.

444
00:38:17,362 --> 00:38:19,296
His hard muscle...

445
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,458
Let's go and put out this fire.

446
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:26,130
Okay. Could we make love first, though?

447
00:38:32,377 --> 00:38:35,938
At the bistro today,
they had garlic snails.

448
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:40,076
I was meeting a girl,
so I had steak and onions.

449
00:38:40,952 --> 00:38:44,752
Don't let us disturb you.
Just passing through.

450
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:47,281
Vampire films don't mention onions.

451
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:53,622
Have a nice evening.

452
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:08,910
The windows are blocked.

453
00:39:10,982 --> 00:39:12,643
Shit, still no signal!

454
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,675
Let's look for...

455
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:17,416
The cellars.
Castles always have them.

456
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:22,416
And to get there, we pass the floor
where they're making blood sausage.

457
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,326
What an excellent idea.

458
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:33,597
A four "posture" bed!
How romantic!

459
00:39:38,343 --> 00:39:40,368
I want you so much.

460
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:46,344
Take me donkey-style,
my little stallion.

461
00:39:53,191 --> 00:39:55,626
- What are you doing?
- Sorry.

462
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:58,459
I can't help it.
My mother's a werewolf.

463
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:02,330
I prefer that.

464
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:14,509
If I don't mark my territory, I'm blocked.

465
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:17,081
You're sick in the head.

466
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:19,379
You're twisted!

467
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:34,121
Let's get down to business.

468
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:25,514
I don't know what came over me.
I'm embarrassed.

469
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:29,316
I was very crude. I'm sorry.

470
00:41:29,354 --> 00:41:32,551
- It's over now. Let me in.
- You're totally sick.

471
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:35,821
What if you'd bitten me?
What would've happened?

472
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,624
I may not be vaccinated.

473
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:40,563
I'll control myself.
I give you my word.

474
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:42,862
I'll let you in.

475
00:41:45,036 --> 00:41:47,027
But don't jump on me.

476
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:49,005
I don't want fur on my dress.

477
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:57,305
I lied, bitch.

478
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,976
You think I'm a mama's boy?

479
00:42:03,955 --> 00:42:05,389
I lied, too.

480
00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:10,224
I don't want a guy
with a lipstick-shaped penis.

481
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:00,806
What?

482
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,780
Hello, my name's Edouard.

483
00:43:12,824 --> 00:43:14,553
Jessica Conti.

484
00:44:00,438 --> 00:44:01,769
That'll do.

485
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:02,967
Sorry.

486
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:06,369
Are there many like him?

487
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:07,900
A whole pack downstairs.

488
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:09,970
Really? Hold it.

489
00:44:11,449 --> 00:44:13,884
I'll call Georges. He'll fix it.

490
00:44:13,918 --> 00:44:17,411
- We tried that.
- You know Georges?

491
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:25,518
- What do we do now? Split?
- What if he wakes up?

492
00:44:25,563 --> 00:44:29,022
Does anyone know how to get rid of
these damn vampires?

493
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:30,625
Buffy uses a stake in the heart.

494
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:33,228
Where do we find one?

495
00:44:33,271 --> 00:44:36,002
I've got this.

496
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,371
We said, "In the heart."

497
00:44:38,943 --> 00:44:41,503
- "In the heart."
- Just trying to help...

498
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,344
This might do the trick.

499
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:51,287
I'm not sure I can.

500
00:44:51,322 --> 00:44:52,585
Want to try?

501
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:55,217
We can't do that.
We're not monsters.

502
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:57,887
You sissies. Hand it over.

503
00:44:57,929 --> 00:45:01,797
I'm a country girl.
Chickens, vampires, it's all the same.

504
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:11,473
All right, his goose is cooked!

505
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:14,834
How can you think about food
at a time like this?

506
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:19,974
Anyway, I think he's dead.

507
00:45:23,588 --> 00:45:26,649
Let's get out of here.

508
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:34,964
Wait, wait!

509
00:45:38,369 --> 00:45:41,395
Let me think for a minute.

510
00:45:48,613 --> 00:45:52,049
Yeah, we won't hang around here.

511
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:54,017
Let's try upstairs.

512
00:45:57,989 --> 00:46:01,653
Go on. In my condition,
I'll only slow you down.

513
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:03,592
You're right. Good luck, Serge.

514
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:08,199
Wait, I think I feel better.

515
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:09,757
I think it's healing.

516
00:46:18,476 --> 00:46:19,705
Wait.

517
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:36,484
I have to do everything.

518
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:39,961
I smell trouble!

519
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:46,095
That's normal. It's moldy.
Old castles always smell.

520
00:46:49,073 --> 00:46:51,041
Dear friend!

521
00:46:51,075 --> 00:46:53,066
Krinine. Serge Krinine.

522
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:56,546
I imagine a lance in the gut
must be nasty.

523
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:00,778
I suffer from renal colic,
and that's very painful.

524
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:10,022
You broke my bridge, you idiot!

525
00:47:27,712 --> 00:47:29,441
We said, "In the heart!"

526
00:47:32,983 --> 00:47:36,578
Help! Is anyone there?

527
00:47:37,722 --> 00:47:39,315
Help!

528
00:47:41,659 --> 00:47:43,149
They won't like this.

529
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:46,926
You're telling me.
Their carpet's totally ruined.

530
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:50,457
Help! Come in.

531
00:47:50,501 --> 00:47:52,526
Paul Lefranc?

532
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:55,562
- That's me.
- Why are you handcuffed?

533
00:47:55,606 --> 00:47:57,574
The Duke invited me.

534
00:47:57,608 --> 00:48:02,478
When I arrived, they tied me up.
No photos!

535
00:48:02,513 --> 00:48:05,676
Mr. Minister, I'll help you.

536
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,649
What are you doing here?

537
00:48:09,687 --> 00:48:11,052
I'll explain.

538
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:15,082
I'm a dentist, dental surgeon—
I mean, stomatologist.

539
00:48:15,126 --> 00:48:19,359
I'm also an orthodontist-prosthetist.
But I'm oversimplifying.

540
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:22,992
Do you know the difference
between the disciplines?

541
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:26,697
I'll explain.
First, there's paradontics...

542
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:28,227
By my blood and soul,

543
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:31,037
I swear to serve the cause
of the immortals...

544
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,643
Signed, Catherine de Medici!

545
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:36,976
Where?

546
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:39,108
Here, in the book!

547
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:41,744
Catherine de Medici's signature.

548
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:45,488
August 24, 1572,

549
00:48:45,523 --> 00:48:49,084
Tonight's the anniversary.

550
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:51,220
You know what happened in 1572?

551
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:52,821
No.

552
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:56,458
She had thousands of Protestants
massacred.

553
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:00,459
She made a pact with vampires.
They did the killing for her.

554
00:49:00,504 --> 00:49:02,233
Sorry, that's me in Mauritius.

555
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:05,573
And tonight is August 24th.
They're here to celebrate.

556
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,703
It's crazy...

557
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:22,424
Look what I found.

558
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:28,455
A dumbwaiter.

559
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:31,659
It must go to the kitchen.

560
00:49:34,405 --> 00:49:35,600
It wasn't me.

561
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:52,881
Shut up and don't touch anything!
Don't try to help.

562
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:56,756
I got it!

563
00:49:56,794 --> 00:50:00,753
There, now it's coming.
It's coming.

564
00:50:00,798 --> 00:50:04,098
- I feel it coming.
- It's coming!

565
00:50:04,134 --> 00:50:05,260
It's coming!

566
00:50:05,302 --> 00:50:07,168
It came...

567
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:09,863
What are you doing?

568
00:50:09,907 --> 00:50:12,842
It seems important.
It could come in handy.

569
00:50:12,877 --> 00:50:14,641
Let's go before they show up!

570
00:50:24,822 --> 00:50:28,520
- I thought my last hour had struck.
- No, that was the book's alarm.

571
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:31,290
Move it! There's a door over here.

572
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:39,723
Lordship, Lefranc's disappeared
with the Book of Pacts.

573
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:44,424
Find Francis for me right now.

574
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:56,003
Listen carefully.
I'll have a mud mask to relax my scalp.

575
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:59,949
A shampoo with conditioner
takes two hours.

576
00:51:59,984 --> 00:52:04,182
If Lefranc and the book aren't back
by then, I'll rip out your hearts.

577
00:52:28,579 --> 00:52:30,638
Let me help.

578
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:34,449
My God!

579
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:08,743
Great!

580
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:15,091
No, let's try that one.

581
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:35,401
Wait.

582
00:54:08,178 --> 00:54:12,172
We try a surprise attack,
and you always knock into something.

583
00:54:12,216 --> 00:54:14,275
Can you explain that?

584
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:44,447
One guy says to another guy,

585
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:46,711
"My son's been walking
for three months now."

586
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:50,448
The other guy says,
"Really? He must've gone far."

587
00:54:58,228 --> 00:55:01,357
Not Japanese again!
I'm tired of eating the same thing.

588
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:06,393
One blond says to another blond,
"I took a pregnancy test."

589
00:55:06,436 --> 00:55:11,135
The other says,
"Really? Were the questions difficult?"

590
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,929
Jean-Claude! Patrick!

591
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,829
The battery's dead...

592
00:56:47,004 --> 00:56:48,995
Garlic!

593
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:52,100
Such an old wives' tale.

594
00:56:56,313 --> 00:56:58,611
And perfectly ineffective.

595
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:01,711
Dumb broad.

596
00:57:03,553 --> 00:57:05,851
I think it's over.

597
00:57:07,357 --> 00:57:09,826
Alice...

598
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:12,352
Oh, Alice!

599
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:20,199
I was counting on her.

600
00:57:20,237 --> 00:57:23,673
You had a little crush. Is that it?

601
00:57:23,707 --> 00:57:27,439
You're still young. You'll see.

602
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:32,108
Girls in your life...
there'll be hundreds, dozens.

603
00:57:32,149 --> 00:57:33,981
You'll have others.

604
00:57:40,557 --> 00:57:42,218
Edouard?

605
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:49,263
Your teeth... They're...

606
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,199
Yellow!

607
00:58:01,912 --> 00:58:03,880
- There you are.
- Tell me she's alive.

608
00:58:03,914 --> 00:58:06,940
I think so.

609
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:09,180
You don't look so good.

610
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:13,349
I ate some garlic.
I think I'm allergic.

611
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:16,621
I know I'm allergic to nuts, but not this.

612
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:19,152
Your uncle's been looking for you.

613
00:58:19,196 --> 00:58:22,564
I was tracking a group of guests
trying to get away.

614
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:24,863
They stole the Book of Pacts.

615
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:28,098
Sir, I found a fugitive.

616
00:58:28,138 --> 00:58:29,606
He's dead.

617
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:32,631
Yeah, some guy named...
what was it again?

618
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:35,304
Krinine. What a pain!

619
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:38,212
Your uncle wanted that pain
to be one of us.

620
00:58:39,016 --> 00:58:40,347
What?

621
00:58:40,384 --> 00:58:45,914
If nobody tells me,
how am I supposed to know?

622
00:58:45,956 --> 00:58:48,982
Listen, Eddie, you're still young.

623
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:50,892
You don't understand these things.

624
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:54,124
But if you were three centuries old,
with fangs falling out,

625
00:58:54,164 --> 00:58:57,896
you'd appreciate
a dentist in the community.

626
00:58:57,934 --> 00:59:01,734
Well, I'll have to tell your uncle.

627
00:59:01,772 --> 00:59:05,731
What? No, please, I'm begging you.
Not my uncle!

628
00:59:47,017 --> 00:59:48,041
Sorry.

629
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:50,076
My coccyx!

630
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,952
You have lousy aim!

631
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:58,289
Will it hurt? I'm sensitive...

632
00:59:58,328 --> 00:59:59,693
It's like giving blood.

633
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:02,824
Can I have a sandwich afterward?

634
01:00:09,372 --> 01:00:11,397
- Come on! Hurry up!
- Quick!

635
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:14,001
Where's Jessica?

636
01:00:14,044 --> 01:00:15,978
They got her.

637
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,028
Edouard?

638
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,065
What happened?

639
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:24,071
Where's the creep
with the moustache?

640
01:01:24,114 --> 01:01:26,242
I whacked him.

641
01:01:26,283 --> 01:01:29,218
He was going to bite you,
so I attacked.

642
01:01:29,252 --> 01:01:33,314
I grabbed an ax
and hacked off his head.

643
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:35,051
And Krinine?

644
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:39,558
Krinine's dead.

645
01:01:39,596 --> 01:01:41,325
That bastard got him.

646
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:45,900
I thought you said that you axed him.

647
01:01:47,971 --> 01:01:51,134
Yes... yes, yes, yes, yes.

648
01:01:51,174 --> 01:01:53,472
In fact, he was still alive.

649
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:59,210
He dragged himself to Krinine, killed him,
and only afterward did he die.

650
01:01:59,249 --> 01:02:00,717
Without a head?

651
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:03,617
Yeah, he was a tough one.

652
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:06,679
But what do we care?
We're still alive!

653
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:12,423
But what if we only had a minute before
the vampires burst in and killed us? See...

654
01:02:12,462 --> 01:02:14,157
A minute?

655
01:02:14,197 --> 01:02:17,895
Yeah, not exactly...
Maybe more.

656
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:20,699
But it's my first time,
and I'm nervous.

657
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:24,139
We've a minute to live,
and you want to screw me?

658
01:02:24,174 --> 01:02:27,508
- What a sicko!
- What's wrong? Don't you like me?

659
01:02:27,544 --> 01:02:28,670
That's not the problem.

660
01:02:28,712 --> 01:02:32,478
OK, tell me, what's your ideal man?

661
01:02:32,515 --> 01:02:36,008
I don't know... long blond hair,
bright blue eyes,

662
01:02:36,052 --> 01:02:38,817
and especially much shorter than me.

663
01:02:38,855 --> 01:02:41,654
Don't go on. I get it.

664
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:44,319
Edouard, I... I'm sorry.

665
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:53,564
- No, not you!
- Yes, me!

666
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:56,368
How could you?
You're a pervert.

667
01:02:56,406 --> 01:03:00,104
These parties bore me.
I love what happens before.

668
01:03:00,143 --> 01:03:03,841
When you begin to get it,
fear mounts, tears— it's fun!

669
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:08,477
But then comes the dinner...
we massacre and massacre. So repetitive!

670
01:03:08,518 --> 01:03:11,544
You're worse than they are.
You're a monster!

671
01:03:11,588 --> 01:03:13,647
You don't know what it's like.

672
01:03:13,690 --> 01:03:17,456
Let me have a bite, and you'll see.
You'll be immortal.

673
01:03:17,494 --> 01:03:18,586
Wait!

674
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:20,357
Young, 'til the end of time!

675
01:03:20,397 --> 01:03:22,456
Botox isn't for dogs.

676
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:25,360
What's going on?

677
01:03:26,770 --> 01:03:28,204
She's mine!

678
01:03:30,774 --> 01:03:33,243
Never! I'll die first!

679
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:36,845
I challenge you to a duel.

680
01:03:37,881 --> 01:03:40,077
Okay. What kind?

681
01:03:42,619 --> 01:03:44,519
Rock-Paper-Scissors?

682
01:03:47,624 --> 01:03:49,251
Who can piss the furthest?

683
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:52,651
We're not 12 anymore.

684
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:55,391
Okay, swords.

685
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:29,390
D'Artagnan was in my dad's class.
We're a sword family.

686
01:04:53,189 --> 01:04:55,749
I'll have my revenge!

687
01:04:57,627 --> 01:05:00,528
Ouch! Damn it!

688
01:05:03,967 --> 01:05:05,958
Alice?

689
01:05:07,971 --> 01:05:10,099
Alice?

690
01:05:12,609 --> 01:05:13,940
Alice?!

691
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:09,494
Aw, how sweet.
She's praying for help.

692
01:06:09,532 --> 01:06:12,433
Not exactly.
I was blessing the water.

693
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:18,163
You have to be a priest to bless water.

694
01:06:18,208 --> 01:06:22,406
When I was 12, I fell for
Richard Chamberlain in The Thorn Birds.

695
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:24,413
I wanted to be a nun.

696
01:06:24,447 --> 01:06:27,473
I learned my prayers by heart.

697
01:06:52,108 --> 01:06:58,172
I was expelled for French-kissing a monk,
but you're not supposed to know that.

698
01:07:05,822 --> 01:07:07,950
We'll never get out of here.

699
01:07:07,991 --> 01:07:10,221
We'll all die.

700
01:07:17,267 --> 01:07:19,395
Keep it together.

701
01:07:19,435 --> 01:07:21,529
Where's Alice?

702
01:07:21,571 --> 01:07:23,630
Where is she?

703
01:07:23,673 --> 01:07:25,141
What happened to her?

704
01:07:25,174 --> 01:07:28,337
We'll find a solution, I swear.

705
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:32,042
The good guys always survive
in the movies.

706
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:33,947
Not Obi-Wan Kenobi.

707
01:07:37,253 --> 01:07:39,745
Can that book help us?

708
01:07:44,694 --> 01:07:46,685
Names, names... it's crazy.

709
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:48,754
They all had a pact with the vampires?

710
01:07:51,534 --> 01:07:57,769
Worlovsky, Hernandez, Horloff,
Stevens, Fruchard...

711
01:07:57,807 --> 01:07:58,797
Lefranc!

712
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:02,641
Give me that book.
You've done enough damage already.

713
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:11,350
Are you okay?

714
01:08:12,121 --> 01:08:13,589
That bastard!

715
01:08:13,623 --> 01:08:15,523
I'm Paul Lefranc, the Duke's friend!

716
01:08:15,558 --> 01:08:19,324
I'm coming up. No funny stuff.
Put away your fangs.

717
01:08:19,362 --> 01:08:21,558
Kindly take me to the Duke.

718
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:26,832
There was also your friend,
Stephane Robert,

719
01:08:26,869 --> 01:08:30,328
who got away, along with...

720
01:08:30,373 --> 01:08:31,863
Lordship, it's frightful!

721
01:08:31,908 --> 01:08:35,867
I know.
The conditioner frizzes out my hair.

722
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:40,243
You don't look so hot yourself, Francis.

723
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:43,947
It's nothing. An allergy.
I think it's edema. I'm puffing up.

724
01:08:43,987 --> 01:08:47,150
It's frightful... Krinine is dead!

725
01:08:50,493 --> 01:08:51,722
- Dead?
- Slain.

726
01:08:51,761 --> 01:08:53,195
- Butchered?
- Iced.

727
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:02,131
Duke, thanks to me, we've found
the Book of Pacts. It's in the cellar.

728
01:09:02,171 --> 01:09:04,606
Let's go.

729
01:09:05,241 --> 01:09:07,073
Not you.

730
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:12,412
Our guests' plane crashes in four hours.
You've an official statement to prepare.

731
01:09:12,448 --> 01:09:15,509
Mr. Brunello will be with you
for the inquiry.

732
01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:18,043
We wouldn't like our name involved.

733
01:09:18,087 --> 01:09:22,251
Don't worry, Lordship.
He'll have me on his back.

734
01:10:21,317 --> 01:10:23,979
We'll never get through.

735
01:10:25,621 --> 01:10:30,559
Look. This part looks different
from the rest.

736
01:10:30,593 --> 01:10:33,324
It's some sort of magic incantation.

737
01:10:36,466 --> 01:10:37,865
It's Greek to me.

738
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,959
No, it's Latin.

739
01:10:49,412 --> 01:10:52,109
Prune! What's happened to us?

740
01:10:52,148 --> 01:10:55,675
Vampires don't always turn into bats.

741
01:10:55,718 --> 01:10:58,551
Help! I can't die as a hamster!

742
01:10:58,588 --> 01:11:00,886
I'll try another incantation.

743
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:03,756
Hurry, I'm dying for some celery.

744
01:11:09,999 --> 01:11:11,933
What the hell is this?

745
01:11:11,968 --> 01:11:14,528
Go on, try another one.

746
01:11:18,741 --> 01:11:21,870
What kind of shit is this?
Let's try another.

747
01:11:21,911 --> 01:11:25,370
Hold on. I have an idea.

748
01:11:25,414 --> 01:11:29,214
Climb through.
Give me your hands!

749
01:11:29,252 --> 01:11:30,777
Pull!

750
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:32,618
My book!

751
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:41,360
Go around! Catch them!

752
01:11:41,397 --> 01:11:44,025
You okay? Come on.

753
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:47,468
Can't we try another incantation first?

754
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:55,342
Run! They've gone to the right!

755
01:11:55,378 --> 01:11:57,176
Follow them!

756
01:11:57,213 --> 01:12:01,844
Sorry, Lordship,
I think the showers are to the right.

757
01:12:01,884 --> 01:12:06,981
You question me? I know the cellars
like the back of my hand.

758
01:12:07,023 --> 01:12:12,189
The door!
It's freezing in here.

759
01:12:12,228 --> 01:12:15,755
Straight ahead.
Catch them! Hurry!

760
01:12:15,798 --> 01:12:23,000
Actually, before we die,
I should tell you something...

761
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:25,201
I've always loved you.

762
01:12:25,241 --> 01:12:28,700
Except during your baggy jeans phase
in high school.

763
01:12:28,744 --> 01:12:30,678
Otherwise...

764
01:13:13,155 --> 01:13:14,623
Go on!

765
01:13:18,261 --> 01:13:22,198
My book! The hell with you!
Give back the book!

766
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:25,895
No matter where you go, I'll find you!

767
01:13:25,935 --> 01:13:28,302
How about another incantation?

768
01:13:28,337 --> 01:13:31,773
These Lycra pants are hurting my balls.

769
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:37,839
What I like about Mallarme
is his hair-raising romanticism.

770
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:33,329
Leaving without saying goodbye?
Not very polite.

771
01:14:41,444 --> 01:14:45,176
Why hide behind that tree?
Come on, I saw you!

772
01:14:45,214 --> 01:14:48,946
No use hiding.
We're fine together here.

773
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:58,684
You little slut!
You've discovered my secret.

774
01:14:58,728 --> 01:15:01,754
Now you know why my uncle
hates me so much.

775
01:15:01,797 --> 01:15:06,132
With his magnificent hair,
he considers me the family misfit.

776
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:08,637
Naturally, when I first saw you,

777
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:12,972
I noticed your lovely hair
and the beautiful kids we'd have.

778
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:16,445
It's time to give my descendants some hair.

779
01:15:18,647 --> 01:15:20,445
It's over, Alize.

780
01:15:20,483 --> 01:15:22,542
You're zafe and zound.

781
01:15:25,154 --> 01:15:28,988
Edvard! You're a wampire, too!

782
01:15:31,594 --> 01:15:34,120
Why don't you fry in ze daylight?

783
01:15:34,163 --> 01:15:36,825
I'm smarter than the others.

784
01:15:36,866 --> 01:15:44,774
I've got my Clarins sunblock, anti-UV
and UVB, with deep skin hydration.

785
01:15:46,342 --> 01:15:48,276
Give me back that book.

786
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:51,041
Hold it.

787
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:52,912
You must kill me first!

788
01:15:55,351 --> 01:15:57,012
Nice rug.

789
01:16:12,968 --> 01:16:15,403
I smell barbecue.

790
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:22,404
Give me back my sunblock!
My sunblock, quick!

791
01:16:24,547 --> 01:16:27,414
I'm burning! Let it rain!

792
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:32,915
It's not working... Please!

793
01:16:38,727 --> 01:16:42,960
Medici Night... holy shit!

794
01:16:42,998 --> 01:16:44,124
Medici Night...

795
01:16:52,208 --> 01:16:55,701
What's going on?

796
01:16:55,744 --> 01:17:00,079
I'll explain,
but let's get out of here first.

797
01:17:04,954 --> 01:17:07,048
Please, enough with
the incantations already!

798
01:17:07,089 --> 01:17:09,319
- Okay.
- Thank you.

799
01:21:31,787 --> 01:21:36,418
And that's how the tumultuous story
of Sam, Prune, and Alice ends.

800
01:21:36,458 --> 01:21:38,483
What will become of our three friends?

801
01:21:38,527 --> 01:21:41,326
Is Sam doomed to a horrible destiny?

802
01:21:41,363 --> 01:21:44,264
Will the two hamsters be well-fed?

803
01:21:44,299 --> 01:21:46,267
You'll find out...

804
01:21:46,301 --> 01:21:47,700
What are you doing here?

805
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:51,138
LMFFWVO: Liberation Movement
for Films Without Voice-Over.

806
01:21:51,173 --> 01:21:53,608
Die, you scum!

807
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:03,848
That's it! Now we can watch
the end of the film in peace.

808
01:22:03,886 --> 01:22:07,049
Have a good evening, folks.
