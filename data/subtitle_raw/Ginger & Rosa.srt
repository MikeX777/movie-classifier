1
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,218
The Defense Department of the
United States government...

2
00:02:45,323 --> 00:02:47,553
has arrived at estimates
of casualties...

3
00:02:47,658 --> 00:02:50,422
should they and the Soviet Union
adopt a counterforce strategy...

4
00:02:50,528 --> 00:02:52,155
in the event of nuclear war.

5
00:02:53,497 --> 00:02:55,328
The estimates are as follows.

6
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:58,163
100,000,000 dead
in the United States...

7
00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:00,760
115,000,000
dead in Europe...

8
00:03:00,871 --> 00:03:04,398
including 23,000,000 dead
in Great Britain.

9
00:03:04,508 --> 00:03:07,409
Without any civil defense,
the counterforce strategy...

10
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:10,912
has the capacity to destroy
all life in Western Europe...

11
00:03:11,015 --> 00:03:14,144
the United States and
the Soviet Union.

12
00:03:14,252 --> 00:03:15,718
With an effective...

13
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,811
I want to talk to you
about the girls.

14
00:03:18,856 --> 00:03:21,552
All right.
What about them?

15
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:26,421
I think Rosa's a bad influence.

16
00:03:29,467 --> 00:03:30,934
Meaning what, exactly?

17
00:03:31,035 --> 00:03:33,834
Anoushka worries about her.

18
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:35,600
She says she's disturbed.

19
00:03:35,707 --> 00:03:39,107
So would you be if you'd been told you
were a failure when you were 11 years old.

20
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:43,203
- Yeah. Bloody 11-plus exams.
- You did well though.

21
00:03:43,314 --> 00:03:45,373
Not that exams mean anything
of reaI significance.

22
00:03:45,483 --> 00:03:46,950
Can't measure intelligence.

23
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:48,643
Anyway,
she's not disturbed.

24
00:03:48,753 --> 00:03:50,220
She's interesting.

25
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:52,312
And she's my best friend.

26
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,307
Close your eyes.

27
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:22,579
Turn your head.
Opposite way.

28
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,757
You're not doing it right.

29
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:10,366
Try again.

30
00:06:10,095 --> 00:06:11,959
Where the hell
have you been?

31
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:16,261
We were just, you know,
roving about.

32
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:21,438
- Being free.
- It's 2:00 in the morning.

33
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:26,303
Roland, please.
Say something.

34
00:06:27,813 --> 00:06:30,782
Well, yes, it is late.

35
00:06:30,882 --> 00:06:32,873
You always stay up late.

36
00:06:34,151 --> 00:06:35,118
True.

37
00:06:39,057 --> 00:06:41,525
Anoushka must be
crazed with worry.

38
00:06:42,961 --> 00:06:44,428
Doubtful.

39
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,156
Rosa.

40
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:54,605
Okay, come on. I suppose I'd
better drive you home, Rosa.

41
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:57,573
Jesus.
I should be working.

42
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:57,795
Tomorrow?

43
00:07:57,903 --> 00:08:00,304
- Today, actually.
- Good point.

44
00:08:01,073 --> 00:08:02,539
Bye, Ginger's dad.

45
00:08:03,141 --> 00:08:04,802
It's Roland...

46
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,377
actually.

47
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:18,180
It says here that a girl's most important
possession is a bubbly personality.

48
00:08:19,025 --> 00:08:20,492
Interesting.

49
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,051
Do you think Simone de Beauvoir
has a bubbly personality?

50
00:08:25,163 --> 00:08:27,529
- Who?
- That French writer.

51
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,758
She's an existentialist.

52
00:08:30,702 --> 00:08:32,897
Maybe she hasn't read Girl.

53
00:08:33,004 --> 00:08:35,666
It says here that boys don't like girls
who are too serious.

54
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,648
Well, even so...

55
00:08:42,748 --> 00:08:45,046
did I tell you I've
decided to be a poet?

56
00:08:45,952 --> 00:08:47,543
Thought you were already.

57
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,517
Do you think they've
shrunk enough yet?

58
00:09:01,067 --> 00:09:02,364
Sorry.

59
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:00,855
- I've been thinking.
- Unusual.

60
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,723
Very funny.
Listen.

61
00:10:02,828 --> 00:10:04,693
I'm listening.

62
00:10:04,797 --> 00:10:07,630
I'd prefer the world not to end.
Wouldn't you?

63
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:09,868
Probably...

64
00:10:11,137 --> 00:10:12,764
if I find true love.

65
00:10:16,307 --> 00:10:17,774
You know?

66
00:10:19,611 --> 00:10:21,307
The kind that lasts forever.

67
00:10:23,616 --> 00:10:26,016
If there is a forever.

68
00:10:26,118 --> 00:10:27,585
Good point.

69
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,487
But really, Rosa...

70
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:35,389
I think we should
do something...

71
00:10:35,494 --> 00:10:37,120
about the bomb.

72
00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:39,690
You know, protest.

73
00:10:41,332 --> 00:10:42,960
I think we should pray.

74
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,377
Gosh.

75
00:10:54,146 --> 00:10:55,613
Thank you.

76
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,050
Rosa?

77
00:13:51,191 --> 00:13:52,658
Isn't that Mum's?

78
00:13:53,827 --> 00:13:55,123
So?

79
00:14:57,691 --> 00:15:00,626
- Where are you two going?
- To a meeting.

80
00:15:00,727 --> 00:15:02,250
What kind of meeting?

81
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:04,454
A meeting to ban the bomb.

82
00:15:04,563 --> 00:15:06,794
It's called the Campaign
for Nuclear Disarmament.

83
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,198
YCND.

84
00:15:09,302 --> 00:15:10,769
What's the "Y" for?

85
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,269
Young.

86
00:15:12,372 --> 00:15:15,034
Well, good for you two girls.

87
00:15:15,141 --> 00:15:17,302
That's marvelous.
Don't you think so, Nat?

88
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,877
Roland would be pleased.

89
00:15:18,978 --> 00:15:20,809
Just don't get back
too late, Rosa.

90
00:15:20,914 --> 00:15:23,814
- You've got to help me with the little
ones. - I haven't got to do anything.

91
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,850
God, if there was
a man around...

92
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,783
- You'd be lucky.
- Rosa!

93
00:15:28,888 --> 00:15:30,355
Speaking of which...

94
00:15:30,457 --> 00:15:32,857
when was the last time
you did any washing up, Ginger?

95
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,257
But I've hardly been
here for any meals.

96
00:15:35,362 --> 00:15:38,661
Well, exactly.
Where have you been?

97
00:15:38,765 --> 00:15:41,427
I had a letter from your school.
It was embarrassing.

98
00:15:41,534 --> 00:15:43,161
Embarrassing.

99
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:45,293
How terrible.

100
00:15:45,404 --> 00:15:47,600
Especially given that the
world might blow up...

101
00:15:47,707 --> 00:15:50,232
which none of you
seem to understand.

102
00:15:50,343 --> 00:15:53,039
Are you quite sure
about that, darling?

103
00:15:53,146 --> 00:15:56,547
Oh, Mark, I didn't mean you.

104
00:15:59,119 --> 00:16:01,849
The question is what to do.

105
00:16:01,955 --> 00:16:03,946
Or, as Engels puts it,
"What is to be done?"

106
00:16:04,057 --> 00:16:08,460
Nuclear weapons
do not protect us.

107
00:16:08,561 --> 00:16:10,620
They threaten our
very existence.

108
00:16:11,765 --> 00:16:14,199
The missiles on bases
here in Britain...

109
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,996
are hundreds of times
more powerful...

110
00:16:17,103 --> 00:16:19,298
than those used in Hiroshima.

111
00:16:19,406 --> 00:16:21,499
We have to take direct action.

112
00:16:22,275 --> 00:16:26,974
We must do everything we can
to stop this madness.

113
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,674
The government can't ignore it if there
are enough people on the streets.

114
00:16:29,783 --> 00:16:31,250
So how do we get people out?

115
00:16:31,351 --> 00:16:35,014
How do we get people out of their
homes and marching with us?

116
00:16:35,121 --> 00:16:38,215
You back there.
Well, girls?

117
00:16:38,324 --> 00:16:40,121
Haven't seen you here before.

118
00:16:40,226 --> 00:16:41,693
What do you say?

119
00:16:42,395 --> 00:16:44,920
Do you think the politicians
will listen to us?

120
00:16:51,905 --> 00:16:53,031
In my...

121
00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:55,300
In my dream I heard
the warning.

122
00:16:56,876 --> 00:16:58,741
"You have three
minutes left," it said.

123
00:17:00,013 --> 00:17:01,878
"Go and tell the others.

124
00:17:04,317 --> 00:17:07,081
Tell the others now."

125
00:17:07,187 --> 00:17:09,656
How could I not
suspect something?

126
00:17:09,757 --> 00:17:11,224
You're never here.

127
00:17:11,325 --> 00:17:12,883
I'm here now.

128
00:17:12,993 --> 00:17:16,018
- Tell me.
- For God's sake.

129
00:17:16,129 --> 00:17:18,495
"Tell the others now,
this morning."

130
00:17:18,598 --> 00:17:20,589
Don't tell me what's enough.

131
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,861
Oh, God, Natalie!

132
00:17:27,507 --> 00:17:30,306
Or... Or you...

133
00:17:30,411 --> 00:17:31,878
"Or you soon...

134
00:17:33,481 --> 00:17:36,677
will all be dead."

135
00:17:38,384 --> 00:17:40,784
"Or you soon will all be dead."

136
00:17:52,366 --> 00:17:53,594
Ta.

137
00:18:05,578 --> 00:18:07,910
What on earth is that crucifix
doing round your neck?

138
00:18:08,014 --> 00:18:10,245
Rosa and I went to church.

139
00:18:10,851 --> 00:18:13,251
- Church?
- Once.

140
00:18:13,354 --> 00:18:15,083
She wanted me to.

141
00:18:16,123 --> 00:18:18,421
You do realize that
God is an invention.

142
00:18:20,126 --> 00:18:21,593
Sort of.

143
00:18:21,694 --> 00:18:25,425
Every man needs to struggle
for his own authority, Ginger.

144
00:18:25,532 --> 00:18:27,329
For autonomous thought.

145
00:18:29,102 --> 00:18:31,333
Which is why you mustn't
listen to a word I say.

146
00:18:31,438 --> 00:18:33,133
Well, exactly.

147
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,435
I autonomously decided
to go to church with Rosa...

148
00:18:35,543 --> 00:18:37,010
to see what it's like.

149
00:18:40,814 --> 00:18:43,976
- It's a bit kitsch.
- Rosa gave it to me.

150
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,550
Did she now?

151
00:18:50,723 --> 00:18:52,191
What was it like?

152
00:18:53,827 --> 00:18:56,887
It was sort of exciting,
like going to the theater.

153
00:18:56,997 --> 00:18:58,487
Then we went to a meeting.

154
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,868
- What kind of meeting?
- Ban the bomb.

155
00:19:03,803 --> 00:19:05,270
That's my girl.

156
00:19:06,005 --> 00:19:09,133
See, you're an activist,
not a supplicant.

157
00:19:09,809 --> 00:19:11,869
But don't you think...

158
00:19:11,979 --> 00:19:15,005
you know, people need
something to believe about...

159
00:19:15,115 --> 00:19:16,980
what happens when you die?

160
00:19:19,219 --> 00:19:23,713
The concept of life after
death is a superstition...

161
00:19:24,391 --> 00:19:28,349
designed to keep people happy with
their limited existence in the present.

162
00:19:28,461 --> 00:19:31,658
The only life is the
one we have now...

163
00:19:31,765 --> 00:19:34,563
which is why we must seize it...

164
00:19:34,668 --> 00:19:37,694
and live while we
have the chance.

165
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,501
Good point.

166
00:20:11,037 --> 00:20:13,165
# Maybe

167
00:20:13,273 --> 00:20:18,575
# Tuesday will be

168
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:24,413
# My good news day

169
00:20:28,822 --> 00:20:32,587
# We'll build a little home

170
00:20:34,395 --> 00:20:37,421
# Just meant for two

171
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,236
# From which I'll never roam

172
00:20:44,705 --> 00:20:48,869
# Who would?
Would you? #

173
00:20:48,976 --> 00:20:50,443
Where's Roland?

174
00:20:51,245 --> 00:20:52,712
I don't know.

175
00:20:54,248 --> 00:20:56,580
I never seem to know
where he is anymore.

176
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:01,344
Want a cup of tea, Mum?

177
00:21:02,856 --> 00:21:04,323
Thank you, darling.

178
00:22:20,168 --> 00:22:23,330
- Who's that with Roland?
- The jazz band?

179
00:22:23,437 --> 00:22:26,429
No, the girl.
Blonde one sitting next to him.

180
00:22:28,242 --> 00:22:30,005
A student or something.

181
00:22:43,591 --> 00:22:47,048
Mum's not too happy
about it at the moment.

182
00:23:13,821 --> 00:23:16,723
You could consider
eating it, Ginger.

183
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,493
How's school, by the way?

184
00:23:25,733 --> 00:23:27,996
Or are you still not really bothering
with that at the moment?

185
00:23:29,236 --> 00:23:31,295
Is that why you
asked me round?

186
00:23:32,239 --> 00:23:34,036
Did Mum ask you to talk to me?

187
00:23:34,141 --> 00:23:36,132
Don't be silly.

188
00:23:36,243 --> 00:23:38,303
We always love seeing you.

189
00:23:38,413 --> 00:23:41,041
Anyway, I thought
you might like to meet Bella.

190
00:23:41,149 --> 00:23:43,117
- She's asked for dish soap.
- What?

191
00:23:43,718 --> 00:23:45,185
What's dish soap?

192
00:23:45,286 --> 00:23:48,949
It's American.
Washing-up liquid, Ginger.

193
00:23:49,057 --> 00:23:52,890
Bella washes her
hair with dish soap.

194
00:23:53,927 --> 00:23:56,157
It's because she's from
New York, you see.

195
00:23:56,263 --> 00:23:58,323
Don't listen to him.
That's got nothing to do with it?

196
00:23:58,433 --> 00:24:01,061
- I'm teasing. I'm teasing.
- Coming!

197
00:24:08,309 --> 00:24:12,039
There you are.
Good girl.

198
00:24:12,145 --> 00:24:14,841
So much nature,
right in the city.

199
00:24:14,948 --> 00:24:16,415
It's civilized.

200
00:24:17,585 --> 00:24:20,816
The English need their parks so that
they can get away from each other.

201
00:24:20,922 --> 00:24:24,517
It must be the strain
of being so nice.

202
00:24:24,626 --> 00:24:26,617
Even the ban-the-bomb
march was polite.

203
00:24:26,728 --> 00:24:29,526
- Were you there too?
- Of course we were.

204
00:24:29,631 --> 00:24:32,623
- I didn't see you.
- Well, so many people, darling.

205
00:24:33,902 --> 00:24:35,698
We were right up at the front.

206
00:24:35,802 --> 00:24:37,565
It was led by a vicar, Ginger.

207
00:24:37,672 --> 00:24:39,640
- A vicar!
- A canon, actually.

208
00:24:39,741 --> 00:24:41,402
No, a vicar with a cannon.

209
00:24:43,211 --> 00:24:44,940
Yes, Canon Collins.

210
00:24:45,046 --> 00:24:46,707
A worthy Christian.

211
00:24:46,814 --> 00:24:49,408
A good man, actually,
despite his beliefs.

212
00:24:53,755 --> 00:24:55,222
Oh, bravo!

213
00:24:56,456 --> 00:25:00,086
So I gather from
your two godfathers here...

214
00:25:00,194 --> 00:25:02,958
that you might be
a militant, like me.

215
00:25:04,065 --> 00:25:05,692
Good for you, Ginger.

216
00:25:41,102 --> 00:25:43,161
Can't you thank me?

217
00:25:43,271 --> 00:25:44,738
Even one word?

218
00:25:47,075 --> 00:25:49,168
I made you a pie.

219
00:25:50,745 --> 00:25:52,474
Your favorite.

220
00:25:53,614 --> 00:25:55,081
Yeah, I noticed.

221
00:25:56,117 --> 00:25:57,778
And?

222
00:25:58,519 --> 00:25:59,817
Thanks.

223
00:26:01,123 --> 00:26:02,589
Is that it?

224
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:04,954
Is that all you
can say to me?

225
00:26:06,728 --> 00:26:10,596
Thank you very much indeed.
Is that what you want?

226
00:26:10,698 --> 00:26:13,633
What's wrong with
wanting my cooking to be noticed?

227
00:26:13,735 --> 00:26:15,202
Nothing.

228
00:26:15,303 --> 00:26:19,638
I don't believe...
this performance.

229
00:26:19,742 --> 00:26:22,575
It's just not you, Nat.
So why don't you come out with it?

230
00:26:22,678 --> 00:26:24,304
Come out with what?

231
00:26:24,412 --> 00:26:27,506
If you want to shame me
again with this display...

232
00:26:27,615 --> 00:26:29,412
- But I didn't say anything.
- But you meant it.

233
00:26:29,517 --> 00:26:32,748
And as I tell my students,
say what you mean.

234
00:26:33,588 --> 00:26:35,783
I'm not your student.

235
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:38,290
I'm your wife.
Have you forgotten?

236
00:26:38,393 --> 00:26:40,828
The martyred wife
finally comes out with it.

237
00:26:40,929 --> 00:26:42,920
- With what?
- The accusation.

238
00:26:43,032 --> 00:26:44,556
Roland, I...

239
00:26:47,101 --> 00:26:49,797
- Why do you...
- Why do I what?

240
00:27:03,652 --> 00:27:06,780
Nat.
Nat.

241
00:27:08,456 --> 00:27:10,651
Why do you twist my words?

242
00:27:13,428 --> 00:27:16,625
You make everything seem
as if it's my fault.

243
00:27:17,832 --> 00:27:20,062
Why can't you just be normal?

244
00:27:20,168 --> 00:27:21,636
Normal?

245
00:27:23,872 --> 00:27:25,339
What the hell is normal?

246
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:28,809
You know bloody
well what I mean.

247
00:27:28,911 --> 00:27:30,901
Natalie, please.

248
00:27:31,012 --> 00:27:32,377
Please.

249
00:27:35,516 --> 00:27:40,351
How can I enjoy eating in this
atmosphere of resentment?

250
00:27:40,455 --> 00:27:43,391
And how can I enjoy cooking
when you just gobble it up?

251
00:27:43,492 --> 00:27:46,893
Oh, for God's sake.
I've been working all day.

252
00:27:48,397 --> 00:27:50,092
But I made it for you.

253
00:27:50,199 --> 00:27:51,564
There's emotional
blackmail again.

254
00:27:53,134 --> 00:27:55,659
If the transitory nature of cooking
and eating offends you so much...

255
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:58,898
then why don't you take up
your painting again...

256
00:27:59,006 --> 00:28:01,874
and make something
for posterity?

257
00:28:01,977 --> 00:28:03,444
And with what?

258
00:28:04,913 --> 00:28:08,371
I'm scraping to pay the bills,
with the money...

259
00:28:08,484 --> 00:28:10,850
Yes, with the money I earn.

260
00:28:10,953 --> 00:28:14,081
- But it's not enough for paint.
- Get a job!

261
00:28:14,189 --> 00:28:16,452
Why don't you sod off
to your bloody yacht?

262
00:28:16,557 --> 00:28:19,117
It's a boat.
It's a small boat.

263
00:28:19,227 --> 00:28:22,356
Your bloody boat with some
blonde student again...

264
00:28:22,464 --> 00:28:23,931
for all I know.

265
00:28:25,467 --> 00:28:27,799
Anyway, what kind
of job could I get?

266
00:28:44,386 --> 00:28:47,048
Roland's moving out.
They're separating.

267
00:28:47,156 --> 00:28:48,589
Again.

268
00:28:49,191 --> 00:28:51,022
Not that it'll make
any difference.

269
00:28:51,126 --> 00:28:53,026
He's hardly ever
at home anyway.

270
00:28:54,296 --> 00:28:56,025
At least you have a dad...

271
00:28:56,131 --> 00:28:57,962
who takes you out and stuff.

272
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,496
I'm sure he wouldn't mind if
you came with me this weekend.

273
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:06,637
You don't want me tagging along
with your beloved Dad.

274
00:29:07,376 --> 00:29:08,968
Don't be silly.

275
00:29:09,077 --> 00:29:12,274
But anyway,
I have a Roland, actually.

276
00:29:12,381 --> 00:29:14,542
- He won't let me call him Dad.
- I know.

277
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:16,515
You told me.
Lots of times.

278
00:29:16,618 --> 00:29:18,085
Did I?

279
00:29:20,489 --> 00:29:22,422
Did I also tell you
he says the word "dad"...

280
00:29:22,523 --> 00:29:24,458
makes him think of
slippers by the fire...

281
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,858
and other bourgeois
death traps?

282
00:29:26,962 --> 00:29:28,589
He has a point, of course.

283
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:32,794
What's Natalie's view
on death traps?

284
00:29:32,901 --> 00:29:34,801
She just bursts into tears...

285
00:29:34,903 --> 00:29:37,463
as usual, when he
says stuff like that.

286
00:29:37,573 --> 00:29:39,040
Which he then says is...

287
00:29:39,141 --> 00:29:41,109
Emotional blackmail.

288
00:29:42,244 --> 00:29:43,541
Rosa!

289
00:29:43,645 --> 00:29:46,409
Rosa, can you bring
the girls up now?

290
00:29:47,749 --> 00:29:49,216
Hello.

291
00:29:50,352 --> 00:29:52,616
Our mothers are pathetic.

292
00:29:52,721 --> 00:29:54,382
They don't believe
in anything.

293
00:29:56,792 --> 00:29:58,487
Or do anything,
more to the point.

294
00:29:59,094 --> 00:30:00,652
Except moan about stuff.

295
00:30:00,762 --> 00:30:02,457
At least your mum has a job.

296
00:30:02,564 --> 00:30:04,556
Cleaning?
You call that a job?

297
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:06,395
She hates it.
She moans on and on.

298
00:30:07,069 --> 00:30:08,832
Roland really hates
the moaning thing.

299
00:30:09,438 --> 00:30:11,235
It's no wonder.

300
00:30:12,774 --> 00:30:15,470
- No wonder what?
- It's no wonder they can't keep their men.

301
00:31:24,546 --> 00:31:26,606
What could be
better than this?

302
00:31:28,618 --> 00:31:30,483
Isn't she marvelous?

303
00:31:33,221 --> 00:31:34,916
Am I right, girls?

304
00:31:35,023 --> 00:31:36,217
It's lovely.

305
00:31:36,325 --> 00:31:37,952
It's so romantic.

306
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,527
Indeed.

307
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:44,829
There is a poetry in small spaces,
isn't there?

308
00:31:46,602 --> 00:31:49,002
Confinement can be
utterly beautiful...

309
00:31:49,972 --> 00:31:52,532
but only if it's a
matter of choice.

310
00:31:53,509 --> 00:31:54,975
What do you mean?

311
00:31:56,111 --> 00:31:58,045
Well, what I mean is...

312
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,641
a prison cell,
on the contrary...

313
00:32:00,749 --> 00:32:03,149
is the ugliest expression
of minimalism.

314
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:07,285
It must have been
really terrible.

315
00:32:08,991 --> 00:32:11,789
Ginger told me about it.

316
00:32:11,894 --> 00:32:13,384
Did she?

317
00:32:17,566 --> 00:32:19,534
We tell each other everything.

318
00:32:26,541 --> 00:32:28,339
I have nothing to hide.

319
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,112
Prison was pretty brutal.

320
00:32:33,216 --> 00:32:35,116
First they strip you
of your clothes.

321
00:32:35,218 --> 00:32:37,846
And then,
if you dare to protest...

322
00:32:37,954 --> 00:32:40,353
they strip you of
all human contact.

323
00:32:40,455 --> 00:32:43,288
But the worst thing
about solitary confinement...

324
00:32:43,392 --> 00:32:47,557
is not that they make you feel
like an abandoned child...

325
00:32:47,663 --> 00:32:50,928
but that you start to
doubt your beliefs.

326
00:33:01,943 --> 00:33:03,240
I understand.

327
00:33:13,456 --> 00:33:15,515
The Soviet defense
minister said today...

328
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:17,752
that their missiles could,
with one blow...

329
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,327
wipe off the face of the earth...

330
00:33:19,429 --> 00:33:21,897
the industrial centers
of the United States.

331
00:33:21,998 --> 00:33:23,624
The British government
has announced...

332
00:33:23,732 --> 00:33:28,261
that nuclear missiles located on Royal
Air Force bases in the United Kingdom...

333
00:33:28,371 --> 00:33:32,831
are capable of the ultimate
retaliation against any Soviet attack..

334
00:33:32,942 --> 00:33:34,409
Did you hear that?

335
00:33:36,145 --> 00:33:38,909
- What?
- About the missiles.

336
00:33:52,462 --> 00:33:54,293
He always does that.

337
00:33:54,397 --> 00:33:56,262
Especially with Schubert.

338
00:34:58,094 --> 00:35:00,028
What do you think
I should say?

339
00:35:01,564 --> 00:35:03,031
Who to?

340
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,292
Roland.

341
00:35:08,538 --> 00:35:10,166
Why are you writing to Roland?

342
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:14,104
Well, I want to tell him
that I understand him.

343
00:35:15,578 --> 00:35:19,378
You know, like sometimes
in your soul...

344
00:35:21,117 --> 00:35:24,678
it's like you... you feel
someone else's pain.

345
00:35:26,889 --> 00:35:28,982
I can't decide whether
to start...

346
00:35:29,091 --> 00:35:31,458
with "Dear Roland"
or "Dearest Roland."

347
00:35:33,597 --> 00:35:35,064
What do you think?

348
00:35:54,117 --> 00:35:56,517
# Tutti frutti, oh, Rudy

349
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,086
# Tutti frutti

350
00:35:59,188 --> 00:36:03,784
# Tutti frutti, oh, Rudy
Tutti frutti, oh, Rudy

351
00:36:03,893 --> 00:36:06,446
# Tutti frutti, oh, Rudy

352
00:36:09,298 --> 00:36:11,995
# Got a gal named Sue

353
00:36:12,102 --> 00:36:14,263
# She knows just what to do #
- Fancy a drink?

354
00:36:14,371 --> 00:36:17,067
# I got a gal named Sue

355
00:36:17,174 --> 00:36:19,641
# She knows just what to do

356
00:36:19,742 --> 00:36:21,573
# She rock to the east
She rock to... #

357
00:36:25,548 --> 00:36:27,277
Oh, Ginger.

358
00:36:28,317 --> 00:36:29,614
You and Rosa.

359
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:33,053
Oh, go away!
You don't understand.

360
00:36:36,226 --> 00:36:37,193
Ginger!

361
00:36:40,931 --> 00:36:42,898
You came to my school.

362
00:36:42,999 --> 00:36:44,466
I saw you.

363
00:36:46,969 --> 00:36:48,630
My teacher told
me you said...

364
00:36:48,738 --> 00:36:51,605
there should be more so-called
domestic science lessons.

365
00:36:51,708 --> 00:36:54,006
Is that what this is all about?

366
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:56,306
How could you?

367
00:36:56,413 --> 00:36:59,143
You wanted me to learn
housework... at school.

368
00:36:59,249 --> 00:37:00,910
Listen, Ginger.

369
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:03,316
When I had you,
I was a teenager.

370
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,611
A teenager.

371
00:37:06,722 --> 00:37:09,953
I didn't know how to
boil a bloody egg.

372
00:37:10,059 --> 00:37:12,255
Roland never lifted a finger
to help with anything.

373
00:37:12,362 --> 00:37:14,830
- That's not my fault!
- Listen to me.

374
00:37:16,099 --> 00:37:19,796
I just don't want you
to struggle like I did.

375
00:37:19,903 --> 00:37:22,599
But I'm never going
to have any babies.

376
00:37:22,706 --> 00:37:24,435
Never.

377
00:37:24,541 --> 00:37:27,338
I don't want to be like you!
So bugger off!

378
00:37:29,178 --> 00:37:31,942
You and Rosa are
turning into little sluts.

379
00:37:33,383 --> 00:37:35,908
Anyway, I'm going to
go live with Roland.

380
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,357
What are you
talking about?

381
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:30,605
Hello.

382
00:38:30,707 --> 00:38:32,401
Is Roland in at all?

383
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:35,477
Follow me.

384
00:38:47,624 --> 00:38:49,251
- Visitor, Roland.
- Thanks.

385
00:38:53,463 --> 00:38:54,930
What a surprise.

386
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:02,705
Is everything all right?

387
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:06,541
Yes.
Absolutely.

388
00:39:06,643 --> 00:39:09,942
Is Nat doing all right?
Not too many scenes or anything?

389
00:39:10,046 --> 00:39:11,513
Not too many.

390
00:39:12,115 --> 00:39:13,582
Good.

391
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:16,945
I'll put the kettle on.

392
00:39:37,841 --> 00:39:39,536
Here, have a seat.

393
00:39:52,255 --> 00:39:53,745
The thing is...

394
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:58,351
I was wondering...

395
00:40:00,997 --> 00:40:02,464
Yes?

396
00:40:06,102 --> 00:40:09,697
If, for example,
there was any room...

397
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:16,607
I mean, I don't know.
It may not be feasible at all.

398
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:19,342
- Room?
- Here.

399
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:26,081
Well.

400
00:40:28,825 --> 00:40:30,292
Jesus, Ginger.

401
00:40:32,929 --> 00:40:34,419
It's a bit of...

402
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,795
You, here?

403
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,566
I suppose I could ask Roger.

404
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:51,442
But look, you do realize,
of course...

405
00:40:51,548 --> 00:40:53,175
I'm working more
or less nonstop...

406
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:56,743
and that this is a completely
unsuitable environment for you...

407
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:58,515
in every possible respect?

408
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:01,858
Absolutely.

409
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:30,013
Are you quite sure that this move
is a wise idea, Ginger?

410
00:41:32,722 --> 00:41:36,158
How old were you when
you left home, Mark Two?

411
00:41:36,259 --> 00:41:38,490
Well, I was about your age.

412
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:40,621
But I had to go.

413
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:42,596
My mother was an
absolute monster.

414
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,059
You see?

415
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,761
Nat is not a monster.

416
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:48,361
Not to you.

417
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:51,669
Anyway, Mark...

418
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:56,212
your mother was, in fact,
as I understand, not a monster...

419
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:59,374
- but a gangster.
- Yes, yes.

420
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:05,114
Was she a happy gangster?

421
00:42:07,425 --> 00:42:11,418
Oh, my darling,
darling Ginger.

422
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,223
Nat is unhappy, darling...

423
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,992
but it's not because of you.

424
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,462
But was she always unhappy?

425
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:25,539
- When she was my age.
You knew her then. - I did, yes.

426
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:28,874
Did she cry all the time
before she had me?

427
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,845
Well, she was troubled, darling.

428
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:34,145
But then, we were all troubled.
It was wartime.

429
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,241
Must have been an
absolute nightmare.

430
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:39,846
You know, bombs falling
all the time, everywhere.

431
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:42,755
I mean, nothing was secure.
Nothing.

432
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,327
What's the difference?

433
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,125
We could all die tomorrow.

434
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,791
We could, Ginger.

435
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,835
For sure.
We could.

436
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:54,768
- Bella.
- Well, she's right.

437
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:56,338
It is getting serious.

438
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:00,101
But I don't want to die.

439
00:43:00,211 --> 00:43:02,179
I want to grow up
and do things.

440
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:05,510
And you will, honey.
You will.

441
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:07,140
My darling Ginger...

442
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:11,445
can't you be a girl for
a moment or two longer?

443
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,424
You'll be a woman soon enough.

444
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:24,267
Roland replied to my letter.

445
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:28,430
Did he?
What did he say?

446
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:31,975
He said he was very touched.

447
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:35,568
He has such deep feelings.

448
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:39,707
- Such fierce feelings.
- I know.

449
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:42,718
- And he's a pacifist.
- I know.

450
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,084
Well, I think it's really noble.

451
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:48,386
- It's eviI to kill.
- Well, exactly.

452
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:50,653
It's one of the
Ten Commandments.

453
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:54,162
Thou shalt not,
et cetera, et cetera.

454
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,367
- You sound a bit cynical.
- Absolutely not.

455
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,031
But I don't need a commandment
to work that one out.

456
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:06,438
I think there are
times for action...

457
00:44:06,544 --> 00:44:08,341
to stop total death.

458
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,218
Look, Rosa.

459
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:24,954
I totally admire my
father in every way...

460
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:26,620
but I'm just not sure...

461
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,964
Is it really so noble to decide
not to fight someone like Hitler?

462
00:44:32,303 --> 00:44:35,101
- Mark says...
- You're always quoting Mark.

463
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:37,799
And you're always
quoting Roland these days.

464
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:40,138
Mark told me he chose
not to fight in the war...

465
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:42,042
because he didn't
want to kill anybody.

466
00:44:42,147 --> 00:44:43,910
He was an ambulance
driver instead.

467
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:45,573
But Roland was in prison...

468
00:44:45,684 --> 00:44:47,378
for being a conscientious
objector.

469
00:44:47,485 --> 00:44:49,214
I know.

470
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,618
He's my father.

471
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:54,748
And I'm going to go live with
him starting this week.

472
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:57,327
And I'm going sailing
with him next weekend.

473
00:44:58,062 --> 00:45:00,121
Do you want to come?

474
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:02,257
Actually, he thought
you should, probably.

475
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:04,592
What do you mean, should?

476
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:40,637
Best room in the house.

477
00:45:41,873 --> 00:45:43,932
Small, but...

478
00:45:44,042 --> 00:45:46,010
perfectly well-formed.

479
00:45:50,649 --> 00:45:52,207
Happy?

480
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,553
I'll put the kettle on.

481
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:15,118
"This is the way the world ends.

482
00:48:16,828 --> 00:48:18,796
This is the way the world ends"...

483
00:48:25,438 --> 00:48:27,428
"Not with a bang"...

484
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,765
"Not with a bang"...

485
00:49:03,608 --> 00:49:07,443
Bella will not be parted from her work
in progress under any circumstances.

486
00:49:07,546 --> 00:49:10,845
Well, there are certain things
that one must hold on to.

487
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:14,385
But don't you think occasionally
there's an argument for letting go, dear?

488
00:49:14,486 --> 00:49:17,922
Don't be fooled by such
phony modernity, Ginger.

489
00:49:18,022 --> 00:49:20,354
Letting go.
Please.

490
00:49:20,959 --> 00:49:23,894
But surely even a poetess...

491
00:49:23,995 --> 00:49:27,454
should be able to relax enough
to enjoy her soup...

492
00:49:27,566 --> 00:49:29,898
especially if it's been
made by Mark.

493
00:49:30,002 --> 00:49:32,664
But one is not a poetess,
Mark Two...

494
00:49:32,772 --> 00:49:36,138
just as one is not a "doctoress"
or a "physicistess."

495
00:49:36,241 --> 00:49:37,708
Here we go.

496
00:49:37,809 --> 00:49:39,743
No, this is not a
matter of principle...

497
00:49:39,844 --> 00:49:42,312
but one of precise language.

498
00:49:42,414 --> 00:49:46,009
Names are word objects
and must be given due respect.

499
00:49:46,117 --> 00:49:49,383
Well, that's an interesting
concept, Bella.

500
00:49:49,488 --> 00:49:50,955
By the way, I am curious.

501
00:49:51,056 --> 00:49:54,321
I understand why you have
this adorable nickname... Ginger.

502
00:49:54,427 --> 00:49:57,691
But what's the name
on your birth certificate?

503
00:50:04,602 --> 00:50:06,797
My father named me...

504
00:50:09,275 --> 00:50:10,742
Africa.

505
00:50:10,843 --> 00:50:12,242
Africa!

506
00:50:12,344 --> 00:50:14,209
Any particular reason?

507
00:50:14,313 --> 00:50:17,941
He said it was in honor of Freud's theory
of the dark continent of woman.

508
00:50:18,049 --> 00:50:20,517
Oh, dear.
Freud.

509
00:50:20,618 --> 00:50:24,076
Is this the famous Roland who
holds us all in his theoretical spell?

510
00:50:35,534 --> 00:50:38,901
Well, let's just stick
with Ginger then, shall we?

511
00:50:39,004 --> 00:50:42,734
Although you could always
move on to Scarlet in due time.

512
00:50:42,841 --> 00:50:46,140
As in flame, not O'Hara.

513
00:50:46,244 --> 00:50:48,770
That's a good name
for an activist.

514
00:50:48,881 --> 00:50:50,439
How's all that going,
by the way?

515
00:50:51,884 --> 00:50:55,752
I'm thinking of joining
the Committee of 100, actually.

516
00:50:55,855 --> 00:50:57,482
I agree with Bertrand Russell.

517
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:59,683
And what do you agree with?

518
00:51:00,659 --> 00:51:02,489
About direct action.

519
00:51:02,594 --> 00:51:06,428
He says the danger of nuclear war
is too great for lawful protest.

520
00:51:06,531 --> 00:51:08,796
So you think marching's not enough?

521
00:51:09,735 --> 00:51:11,828
It may not be enough
to save us...

522
00:51:12,838 --> 00:51:14,567
you know...

523
00:51:14,673 --> 00:51:17,005
from total extinction.

524
00:51:20,212 --> 00:51:22,373
Where are you going?

525
00:51:22,481 --> 00:51:23,947
To a restaurant.

526
00:51:25,016 --> 00:51:26,779
Where are you going?

527
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:29,787
To a meeting.

528
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,123
See you later then.

529
00:51:37,329 --> 00:51:39,024
So you're coming back here?

530
00:51:40,799 --> 00:51:42,460
Maybe.

531
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:50,067
Do you want to try?

532
00:52:16,235 --> 00:52:18,135
This crisis is taking the world...

533
00:52:18,237 --> 00:52:20,137
to the brink of catastrophe.

534
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:23,140
The Russians have put their
missiles on Cuba, as we know...

535
00:52:23,242 --> 00:52:25,142
as part of this deadly battle...

536
00:52:25,244 --> 00:52:27,144
with the United States
for world supremacy...

537
00:52:27,246 --> 00:52:29,372
that could end with
no world at all.

538
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,473
And what is our government
doing about it?

539
00:52:32,585 --> 00:52:35,918
They tell people to put sandbags
over their windows and stay indoors.

540
00:52:36,021 --> 00:52:41,323
Meanwhile, the government have built
top secret bomb shelters underground.

541
00:52:41,427 --> 00:52:44,521
But only enough space
for themselves.

542
00:52:49,768 --> 00:52:53,169
Then who will be left for them to govern?
Everyone else will be dead.

543
00:52:53,272 --> 00:52:54,899
Burnt to cinders.

544
00:52:56,508 --> 00:52:58,305
I think it's immoral.

545
00:52:59,712 --> 00:53:02,010
You know,
to use precise language.

546
00:53:02,114 --> 00:53:04,708
Let me guess.
You shouldn't really be in here.

547
00:53:04,817 --> 00:53:06,444
You're still at school,
aren't you?

548
00:53:07,586 --> 00:53:09,110
Some of the time.

549
00:53:09,221 --> 00:53:11,622
Don't worry.
I'll buy you a drink.

550
00:53:12,892 --> 00:53:14,654
A pint and a half, please.

551
00:53:15,894 --> 00:53:18,124
Thanks.

552
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:21,722
Anyway, I learn more at these
meetings than I ever do at school.

553
00:53:21,834 --> 00:53:23,802
That goes without saying, I think.

554
00:53:28,173 --> 00:53:29,640
Thanks.

555
00:53:35,281 --> 00:53:36,747
Thanks.

556
00:53:42,888 --> 00:53:45,322
Are you a student?

557
00:53:45,424 --> 00:53:46,948
I'm at art school.

558
00:53:47,993 --> 00:53:49,551
Do you draw?

559
00:53:49,662 --> 00:53:51,392
Yes, definitely.

560
00:53:52,565 --> 00:53:54,032
Sometimes.

561
00:53:56,770 --> 00:53:58,896
But I think I'm more
of a poet, actually.

562
00:53:59,004 --> 00:54:00,835
Are you?

563
00:54:02,541 --> 00:54:04,907
My mum used to be
a painter though.

564
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:06,477
What's her name?

565
00:54:06,578 --> 00:54:08,239
You wouldn't know it.

566
00:54:08,347 --> 00:54:11,373
She gave it up,
you know, to have me.

567
00:54:15,789 --> 00:54:17,654
I live with my father
now anyway.

568
00:54:18,692 --> 00:54:20,852
He's a pacifist.

569
00:54:20,959 --> 00:54:22,927
He writes articles and stuff.

570
00:54:23,028 --> 00:54:24,791
Anything I might have read?

571
00:54:25,631 --> 00:54:27,394
"The Idea of Freedom."

572
00:54:30,836 --> 00:54:32,327
He's your father?

573
00:55:50,582 --> 00:55:55,111
Ginger, want to try it?
Think it might be done.

574
00:56:20,046 --> 00:56:21,946
You sure you don't want any?

575
00:56:22,048 --> 00:56:25,108
No, I'm fine, thank you.
I've already eaten.

576
00:56:37,864 --> 00:56:39,729
- That's not bad.
- Who's the chef?

577
00:56:39,833 --> 00:56:42,393
We made it together...
me and Ginger.

578
00:56:42,502 --> 00:56:45,335
Mutual aid.
This is good.

579
00:56:45,438 --> 00:56:47,668
Communist cooks.
How marvelous.

580
00:56:50,343 --> 00:56:53,005
- Anarchists, I think.
- It's Italian, actually.

581
00:56:53,112 --> 00:56:54,578
Bolognese.

582
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:57,582
Oh, there's lots of
anarchists in Bologna.

583
00:57:01,688 --> 00:57:03,155
You...

584
00:57:04,891 --> 00:57:07,189
are a thing of beauty, Rosa.

585
00:57:54,474 --> 00:57:55,999
Oh, Ginger.

586
00:58:22,268 --> 00:58:23,792
Ginger.

587
00:58:37,885 --> 00:58:40,285
- Look, Mum...
- How is everything?

588
00:58:41,221 --> 00:58:43,018
Can I stay the night tonight?

589
00:58:44,123 --> 00:58:46,455
I'm not moving back or anything.

590
00:58:50,029 --> 00:58:52,020
You're painting again.

591
00:58:52,131 --> 00:58:53,723
Yes, I am.

592
00:58:53,833 --> 00:58:55,801
And a bit of studying...

593
00:58:56,970 --> 00:58:58,438
now that...

594
00:58:58,539 --> 00:59:00,097
Well, that's good.

595
00:59:02,476 --> 00:59:04,103
But I could make up your bed.

596
00:59:18,625 --> 00:59:20,684
Aren't you happy
at Roland's...

597
00:59:20,794 --> 00:59:25,060
after going on and on about wanting to
live with him instead of boring old me?

598
00:59:26,567 --> 00:59:28,727
I never said that,
about being boring.

599
00:59:32,739 --> 00:59:34,707
But of course I'm
happy over there.

600
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:38,838
It's really interesting.

601
00:59:40,814 --> 00:59:43,647
It was just a thought anyway.

602
00:59:43,751 --> 00:59:46,777
Don't bother with the bed or anything.
I was just passing.

603
01:00:04,438 --> 01:00:06,531
Made you some supper.

604
01:00:07,508 --> 01:00:08,998
What time is it?

605
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:12,044
About 2:00...

606
01:00:12,146 --> 01:00:13,772
or so.

607
01:00:15,014 --> 01:00:16,481
Somewhat late.

608
01:00:17,717 --> 01:00:19,185
But I cooked it.

609
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:22,311
You said you were hungry.

610
01:00:22,423 --> 01:00:23,890
Well, I was.

611
01:00:23,991 --> 01:00:25,652
You're not going to eat it?

612
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:28,853
Oh, yes.

613
01:00:28,962 --> 01:00:30,452
Yes.

614
01:00:31,498 --> 01:00:33,227
Looks delicious.

615
01:00:34,268 --> 01:00:36,235
I didn't know you could cook.

616
01:00:36,969 --> 01:00:38,459
Nor did I.

617
01:00:49,283 --> 01:00:51,979
Look, I know it's all
got a bit complicated.

618
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:57,851
Perhaps I can never be the
kind of father you really want.

619
01:00:59,626 --> 01:01:02,959
I'm not sure I'm
father material, really.

620
01:01:04,565 --> 01:01:06,362
Oh, but you are.

621
01:01:07,601 --> 01:01:10,069
I never said I wanted
anything different, did I?

622
01:01:10,704 --> 01:01:12,638
You've never complained
about anything, really.

623
01:01:12,739 --> 01:01:16,334
You're not a moaner,
as a rule, thank God.

624
01:01:19,011 --> 01:01:20,479
But look.

625
01:01:23,317 --> 01:01:27,048
Things have been difficult
for me with Nat...

626
01:01:27,154 --> 01:01:29,315
for a long time.

627
01:01:29,423 --> 01:01:31,948
One day you will
understand that...

628
01:01:33,026 --> 01:01:34,891
real love...

629
01:01:34,995 --> 01:01:36,826
when it comes...

630
01:01:39,366 --> 01:01:42,699
is like a siren call.

631
01:01:45,672 --> 01:01:48,766
One simply has no choice...

632
01:01:48,876 --> 01:01:50,741
and one must surrender.

633
01:01:53,847 --> 01:01:55,314
But listen.

634
01:01:59,253 --> 01:02:00,949
I am aware...

635
01:02:01,756 --> 01:02:03,450
that...

636
01:02:03,557 --> 01:02:06,685
perhaps you might
not be entirely happy...

637
01:02:06,793 --> 01:02:08,260
with the situation.

638
01:02:10,164 --> 01:02:12,655
How could anyone be happy...

639
01:02:12,766 --> 01:02:15,234
when you know
about the bomb?

640
01:02:15,335 --> 01:02:17,701
Happiness is not
really an option...

641
01:02:19,673 --> 01:02:22,643
when you know the whole world
could be blown to pieces any minute.

642
01:02:23,545 --> 01:02:25,171
You are a good girl.

643
01:02:27,381 --> 01:02:29,246
You're a born radical...

644
01:02:29,349 --> 01:02:31,180
unsurprisingly.

645
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:43,997
Listen.

646
01:02:45,166 --> 01:02:48,066
I think it's probably best if you
don't say anything to Nat...

647
01:02:48,168 --> 01:02:51,194
about the times with Rosa
on the boat, and so on.

648
01:02:54,408 --> 01:02:56,342
I'm sure we'd agree on this.

649
01:03:44,125 --> 01:03:46,559
...prematurely or unnecessarily...

650
01:03:46,661 --> 01:03:50,188
risk the cost of worldwide
nuclear war...

651
01:03:50,298 --> 01:03:54,131
in which even the fruits of victory
would be ashes in our mouth.

652
01:03:54,234 --> 01:03:56,759
But neither will we
shrink from that risk...

653
01:03:56,870 --> 01:03:59,395
at any time it must be faced.

654
01:03:59,506 --> 01:04:03,739
I have directed the armed forces
to prepare for any eventualities.

655
01:04:04,812 --> 01:04:07,144
It shall be the policy
of this nation...

656
01:04:07,248 --> 01:04:10,513
to regard any nuclear missile
launched from Cuba...

657
01:04:10,618 --> 01:04:13,416
against any nation in the
Western Hemisphere...

658
01:04:13,521 --> 01:04:17,718
as an attack by the Soviet Union
on the United States...

659
01:04:17,824 --> 01:04:22,454
requiring a full retaliatory response
upon the Soviet Union.

660
01:04:23,464 --> 01:04:26,126
The cost of freedom
is always high...

661
01:04:26,234 --> 01:04:28,828
but Americans have
always paid it.

662
01:04:28,936 --> 01:04:31,427
And one path we
shall never choose...

663
01:04:31,539 --> 01:04:35,134
and that is the path
of surrender or submission.

664
01:04:42,516 --> 01:04:45,486
I dreamed there was
a wall of flame.

665
01:04:48,589 --> 01:04:51,057
I screamed because
I was to blame.

666
01:04:53,561 --> 01:04:55,392
I looked around.

667
01:04:58,733 --> 01:05:00,791
No night, no day...

668
01:05:00,901 --> 01:05:03,392
no sky, no ground.

669
01:05:03,503 --> 01:05:05,028
Nothing to say.

670
01:05:07,942 --> 01:05:09,603
Sorry I'm late.

671
01:05:09,711 --> 01:05:11,736
We were talking and talking.

672
01:05:11,846 --> 01:05:13,814
I didn't notice the time.

673
01:05:14,916 --> 01:05:17,214
- It was so...
- Intense.

674
01:05:18,619 --> 01:05:20,086
Right.

675
01:05:24,291 --> 01:05:25,759
Well, it was.

676
01:05:34,135 --> 01:05:35,602
And I think...

677
01:05:37,305 --> 01:05:38,932
I think Roland is wounded.

678
01:05:40,074 --> 01:05:42,508
What do you mean?
What's happened?

679
01:05:42,610 --> 01:05:44,600
Wounded emotionally, I mean.

680
01:05:44,711 --> 01:05:46,612
And spiritually.

681
01:05:46,714 --> 01:05:48,614
I think I can help him.

682
01:05:48,716 --> 01:05:51,810
Help him?
How can you help him?

683
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:56,319
- We have a lot in common, you know.
- Such as?

684
01:05:59,994 --> 01:06:03,122
Such as the fact that his mother
left him when he was little.

685
01:06:03,231 --> 01:06:05,461
You know,
like my father left me.

686
01:06:07,301 --> 01:06:09,064
What a way to bond.

687
01:06:10,304 --> 01:06:11,794
Well, yes, actually.

688
01:06:11,906 --> 01:06:13,806
We understand each other.

689
01:06:13,908 --> 01:06:15,535
He confides in me.

690
01:06:31,058 --> 01:06:32,685
Anyway,
what are you writing?

691
01:06:33,294 --> 01:06:35,285
A poem...

692
01:06:35,396 --> 01:06:37,023
about the end of the world.

693
01:06:38,933 --> 01:06:41,094
Haven't you heard?

694
01:06:41,202 --> 01:06:43,864
- Heard what?
- About the crisis.

695
01:06:45,273 --> 01:06:47,435
Remember those
missiles in Cuba?

696
01:06:47,543 --> 01:06:48,908
What missiles?

697
01:06:49,011 --> 01:06:50,705
Where have you been?

698
01:06:51,979 --> 01:06:53,708
Don't you care about
the future anymore?

699
01:06:53,815 --> 01:06:56,579
Not everyone can save the
whole world like you, Ginger.

700
01:06:56,684 --> 01:06:59,346
Some of us have to concentrate
on just one person.

701
01:06:59,454 --> 01:07:02,548
- You can't save my dad.
- Why not?

702
01:07:05,593 --> 01:07:07,061
Who do you think you are?

703
01:07:07,162 --> 01:07:09,062
Who do you think you are?

704
01:07:09,164 --> 01:07:12,963
You can't stop a war if there's going
to be one. It's in the hands of God.

705
01:07:14,869 --> 01:07:16,564
That's convenient.

706
01:07:16,671 --> 01:07:18,798
Whose hands are you in then?

707
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,148
Just wait.

708
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:30,983
He'll dump you too
when you're older.

709
01:07:31,086 --> 01:07:32,553
No, he won't.

710
01:07:34,822 --> 01:07:37,154
He will.
He will.

711
01:07:39,927 --> 01:07:42,122
We didn't want to tell you.

712
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:48,329
Didn't want to tell me what?

713
01:07:50,973 --> 01:07:52,565
What?

714
01:07:53,509 --> 01:07:55,408
What didn't you
want to tell me?

715
01:07:55,510 --> 01:07:56,977
I think...

716
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:01,412
I'm pregnant.

717
01:08:43,958 --> 01:08:45,448
There are persistent reports...

718
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:49,998
that the American government is about to
make a sensational move in the Cuba crisis.

719
01:08:50,098 --> 01:08:53,625
Lord Bertrand Russell,
in a statement released today said...

720
01:08:53,735 --> 01:08:55,202
"While life remains to us...

721
01:08:55,304 --> 01:08:57,966
we will not cease to do
what lies in our power...

722
01:08:58,073 --> 01:09:00,041
to avert the greatest calamity...

723
01:09:00,142 --> 01:09:02,371
that has ever
threatened mankind."

724
01:09:04,445 --> 01:09:07,608
Ban the bomb!
Ban the bomb!

725
01:09:07,715 --> 01:09:10,207
Look out!
Police!

726
01:09:13,121 --> 01:09:15,589
Sit down!
Everybody sit down!

727
01:09:20,696 --> 01:09:22,163
Gate!

728
01:09:23,464 --> 01:09:26,797
Block the gate!
Everybody block the gate!

729
01:09:29,671 --> 01:09:31,229
Bella!

730
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:33,274
Ban the bomb!
Ban the bomb!

731
01:09:33,375 --> 01:09:34,774
Ginger!

732
01:09:35,477 --> 01:09:37,138
Yes, it's me.

733
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:40,148
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

734
01:09:41,249 --> 01:09:42,944
My God, you're shivering.

735
01:09:46,487 --> 01:09:49,251
Lean on me.
This could get rough. Okay?

736
01:09:49,357 --> 01:09:50,825
Hang on tight.

737
01:09:50,926 --> 01:09:53,554
Ban the bomb!
Ban the bomb!

738
01:09:53,662 --> 01:09:55,527
Ban the bomb!

739
01:09:55,631 --> 01:09:58,259
Move!

740
01:10:17,352 --> 01:10:18,944
Bella!

741
01:10:21,023 --> 01:10:22,991
Bella!

742
01:10:24,059 --> 01:10:26,027
Ginger!

743
01:10:37,372 --> 01:10:40,341
Ban the bomb!
Ban the bomb!

744
01:10:40,442 --> 01:10:44,936
Ban the bomb!
Ban the bomb! Ban the bomb!

745
01:11:21,516 --> 01:11:23,143
I am a doctor.

746
01:11:23,251 --> 01:11:25,219
You can speak freely to me.

747
01:11:28,390 --> 01:11:30,620
Look, I can't help you
unless you talk.

748
01:11:30,726 --> 01:11:32,319
Do you understand?

749
01:11:33,730 --> 01:11:35,630
You seem depressed.

750
01:11:35,731 --> 01:11:37,392
Are you depressed?

751
01:11:39,935 --> 01:11:41,402
Then speak.

752
01:12:04,059 --> 01:12:05,526
Are you the girl's mother?

753
01:12:05,627 --> 01:12:07,094
No.

754
01:12:07,195 --> 01:12:08,822
No, I'm not.

755
01:12:08,930 --> 01:12:12,161
- Where is the mother?
- She doesn't know her daughter is here.

756
01:12:12,267 --> 01:12:14,168
Then is one of you
the girl's father?

757
01:12:14,270 --> 01:12:17,171
We're family friends.
We've come to take her home.

758
01:12:17,273 --> 01:12:21,606
Well, she needs help.
All this protesting is a front, you know.

759
01:12:21,710 --> 01:12:23,974
The girl may be
seriously mentally ill.

760
01:12:24,079 --> 01:12:25,546
Oh, for Christ's sake.

761
01:12:27,015 --> 01:12:29,347
Maybe she's justifiably worried...

762
01:12:29,451 --> 01:12:31,851
about the possibility
of a nuclear holocaust.

763
01:12:33,289 --> 01:12:35,416
Have you considered that?

764
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:51,100
Just talk to us, darling.

765
01:12:51,873 --> 01:12:53,341
Come on.

766
01:12:54,610 --> 01:12:56,202
Did they hurt you?

767
01:12:57,046 --> 01:12:59,514
Ginger, you must tell us.

768
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:02,547
Please say something.

769
01:13:08,023 --> 01:13:09,957
Okay, listen.

770
01:13:11,126 --> 01:13:13,253
I've asked Anoushka
to bring Rosa over.

771
01:13:14,564 --> 01:13:17,556
Thought maybe you'd talk to her,
if you don't want to talk to us.

772
01:13:18,835 --> 01:13:21,497
- Don't make that face at me.
- Nat, don't.

773
01:13:21,604 --> 01:13:24,664
- But I care about her and I...
- You don't care!

774
01:13:25,741 --> 01:13:27,935
Actually,
I think she does, sweetheart.

775
01:13:29,044 --> 01:13:31,478
She doesn't care that
the world might end.

776
01:13:32,180 --> 01:13:34,479
Of course I do!

777
01:13:34,584 --> 01:13:36,484
I'm on your side, Ginger.

778
01:13:36,586 --> 01:13:38,281
You don't know anything.

779
01:13:38,387 --> 01:13:40,218
Well, what else
doesn't she know?

780
01:13:42,959 --> 01:13:44,426
Ginger?

781
01:13:44,527 --> 01:13:47,155
I can't say it.

782
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:49,162
I'll explode if I say it.

783
01:13:49,264 --> 01:13:51,824
No, you won't, sugar.
It's all right.

784
01:13:51,933 --> 01:13:55,335
- Speak it out.
- I can't.

785
01:13:59,275 --> 01:14:01,300
We're all going to die!
You said it!

786
01:14:01,410 --> 01:14:03,037
No.

787
01:14:03,145 --> 01:14:05,238
No, I said we could.

788
01:14:07,683 --> 01:14:10,947
A nuclear war would probably
obliterate us all if it happened...

789
01:14:11,052 --> 01:14:13,953
but that's not what
you mean, is it?

790
01:14:14,055 --> 01:14:16,889
Then what is it you
can't say, Ginger?

791
01:14:17,493 --> 01:14:19,017
What can't you say?

792
01:14:23,633 --> 01:14:25,032
That...

793
01:14:26,903 --> 01:14:28,370
That...

794
01:14:30,139 --> 01:14:32,368
Roland is...

795
01:14:32,474 --> 01:14:34,271
Roland is sleeping...

796
01:14:34,376 --> 01:14:36,811
with Rosa.

797
01:14:40,716 --> 01:14:42,240
What?

798
01:14:45,154 --> 01:14:46,246
Rosa?

799
01:14:52,128 --> 01:14:53,595
Is it true?

800
01:14:55,096 --> 01:14:56,564
I knew it.

801
01:14:58,234 --> 01:15:00,998
I knew something was
going on and you...

802
01:15:01,103 --> 01:15:04,595
- It's all my fault.
- No, no. Of course it's not.

803
01:15:04,707 --> 01:15:06,607
How long has
this been going on?

804
01:15:06,709 --> 01:15:08,267
Oh, for God's sake, Natalie.

805
01:15:10,246 --> 01:15:11,770
Let go of me.

806
01:15:11,881 --> 01:15:13,849
Let go of me!

807
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:16,911
Got to get ahold of Anoushka.

808
01:15:17,019 --> 01:15:19,852
I don't want to see Rosa.
I don't want to see that little bitch!

809
01:15:19,956 --> 01:15:23,187
I've got to get out onto the streets.
The leaflets...

810
01:15:23,292 --> 01:15:25,351
- No, not now, darling.
- Oh, yes, now!

811
01:15:25,461 --> 01:15:28,726
Don't you understand?
The world may be about to end.

812
01:15:28,831 --> 01:15:31,425
- It's all right.
- Do you see what you've done?

813
01:15:35,004 --> 01:15:37,235
What right have
you to judge me?

814
01:15:38,975 --> 01:15:42,103
I've spent my entire life...

815
01:15:42,211 --> 01:15:43,735
fighting against tyranny.

816
01:15:43,846 --> 01:15:45,780
Congratulations.

817
01:15:45,881 --> 01:15:47,542
Not only the tyranny
of government...

818
01:15:47,650 --> 01:15:49,481
but also the tyranny...

819
01:15:49,585 --> 01:15:53,351
of the "shoulds" and the "oughts"
of so-called normal family life.

820
01:15:53,456 --> 01:15:55,253
Oh, how fucking convenient.

821
01:15:55,358 --> 01:15:57,884
And who the fuck are
you to lecture me?

822
01:16:00,496 --> 01:16:02,157
We've only just met.

823
01:16:02,264 --> 01:16:05,563
And not that it's any of your business,
but Natalie and I are separated.

824
01:16:06,168 --> 01:16:07,726
You have a child together.

825
01:16:08,804 --> 01:16:10,431
She's no longer a child.

826
01:16:11,774 --> 01:16:14,038
Ginger may be grown
up enough...

827
01:16:14,143 --> 01:16:18,342
to try to save us all from
nuclear catastrophe, Roland...

828
01:16:18,448 --> 01:16:20,575
but she's also young enough
to still need some looking after.

829
01:16:20,684 --> 01:16:21,946
Listen.

830
01:16:22,052 --> 01:16:27,216
Autonomous thought,
personal truth, freedom of action.

831
01:16:27,323 --> 01:16:30,224
- You believe in those, don't you, Mark?
- Yes, of course I do, but...

832
01:16:30,326 --> 01:16:34,262
Well, these have been
my guiding principles.

833
01:16:34,363 --> 01:16:38,164
I deeply believe in them,
and I was jailed for them.

834
01:16:46,842 --> 01:16:48,400
Don't you see, Ginger?

835
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:52,845
There would not even be the possibility
of nuclear war, or any war...

836
01:16:52,948 --> 01:16:56,679
if millions of men had been prepared to
stand up against authority, as I did...

837
01:16:56,786 --> 01:16:59,017
and refuse to join the army...

838
01:17:00,190 --> 01:17:02,658
refuse to take orders.

839
01:17:02,759 --> 01:17:05,557
It's mindless obedience
that's the killer.

840
01:17:07,997 --> 01:17:10,693
I've broken the rules.

841
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:12,529
All the rules.

842
01:17:12,635 --> 01:17:14,830
Because someone
has to say no.

843
01:17:14,937 --> 01:17:16,529
Mark, please, no.

844
01:17:16,639 --> 01:17:19,803
Nat, ducky, we've got to get this
sorted out, for once and for all.

845
01:17:19,910 --> 01:17:21,741
Come on.
Come. Come.

846
01:17:24,181 --> 01:17:25,648
Oh, Ginger.

847
01:17:25,749 --> 01:17:27,717
She's sleeping with Roland.

848
01:17:27,818 --> 01:17:29,648
- Who?
- Rosa.

849
01:17:29,752 --> 01:17:31,049
What?

850
01:17:33,722 --> 01:17:35,019
Rosa?

851
01:17:36,792 --> 01:17:38,259
With Roland?

852
01:17:51,307 --> 01:17:52,831
Is it true?

853
01:18:08,658 --> 01:18:10,387
Rosa?

854
01:18:12,795 --> 01:18:14,490
Answer me, Rosa.

855
01:18:15,664 --> 01:18:18,360
- Why should I?
- Because I'm your mother.

856
01:18:21,605 --> 01:18:23,596
I didn't notice.

857
01:18:35,784 --> 01:18:38,184
Do you think Mum's all right?

858
01:18:38,287 --> 01:18:39,778
Come.
Come.

859
01:18:46,596 --> 01:18:48,063
Nat?

860
01:18:48,165 --> 01:18:50,326
Nat, darling.
Nat.

861
01:18:51,501 --> 01:18:53,059
Can we come in?

862
01:18:54,337 --> 01:18:55,964
Right.
We're coming in.

863
01:18:57,006 --> 01:18:58,564
Nat, open the door.

864
01:18:59,608 --> 01:19:01,099
Nat, open this door!

865
01:19:01,211 --> 01:19:03,179
Natty, open up!

866
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,145
Roland!
Come quick!

867
01:19:05,949 --> 01:19:07,712
Darling, come on.
Come on.

868
01:19:11,521 --> 01:19:13,250
Mum!

869
01:19:18,761 --> 01:19:20,285
Nat.

870
01:19:21,198 --> 01:19:22,722
Nat.

871
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:28,937
Oh, darling.

872
01:19:31,408 --> 01:19:33,000
Call an ambulance.

873
01:19:33,109 --> 01:19:35,202
Ginger.

874
01:19:36,146 --> 01:19:38,137
Forgive me?
Please?

875
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:31,958
We had a dream...

876
01:20:34,571 --> 01:20:37,438
that we would always
be best friends.

877
01:20:45,349 --> 01:20:47,111
When we were born...

878
01:20:49,853 --> 01:20:52,185
for some it was the end.

879
01:20:56,059 --> 01:20:59,358
Now it seems there
may not be tomorrow.

880
01:21:05,202 --> 01:21:07,067
But despite the horror...

881
01:21:09,572 --> 01:21:11,039
and the sorrow...

882
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:19,380
I love our world.

883
01:21:25,089 --> 01:21:27,421
I want us all to live.

884
01:21:33,496 --> 01:21:35,088
Now, Rosa...

885
01:21:36,533 --> 01:21:38,398
you've asked me to forgive.

886
01:21:45,910 --> 01:21:47,639
One day...

887
01:21:47,745 --> 01:21:50,612
if Mum survives
this bitter night...

888
01:21:58,054 --> 01:21:59,783
then we shall meet again...

889
01:22:02,625 --> 01:22:04,093
and I will say...

890
01:22:08,933 --> 01:22:10,992
I loved you, Rosa.

891
01:22:15,739 --> 01:22:17,536
Don't you see?

892
01:22:21,611 --> 01:22:23,238
But we are different.

893
01:22:27,385 --> 01:22:30,252
You dream of everlasting love.

894
01:22:35,493 --> 01:22:37,016
Not me.

895
01:22:46,437 --> 01:22:48,701
Because what
really matters...

896
01:22:53,577 --> 01:22:55,169
is to live.

897
01:23:02,919 --> 01:23:04,750
And if we do...

898
01:23:09,393 --> 01:23:11,623
there will be nothing
to forgive.

899
01:23:20,271 --> 01:23:22,135
What are you writing?

900
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:26,433
Oh, a poem...

901
01:23:26,544 --> 01:23:28,341
about the future.

902
01:23:42,092 --> 01:23:44,082
I'm sorry, Ginger.

903
01:23:53,838 --> 01:23:55,465
I'm so sorry.

904
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:18,424
But I'll forgive you anyway.
