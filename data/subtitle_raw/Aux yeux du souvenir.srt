MEMORIAL EYES

2
00:01:31,028 --> 00:01:33,877
This movie is dedicated
to the crews of civil aviation.

3
00:01:33,877 --> 00:01:37,452
His characters are fictionalized.

4
00:01:37,452 --> 00:01:41,214
Nevertheless, the feat
performed on February 17, 1947.

5
00:01:41,214 --> 00:01:43,822
over the Atlantic by one
by one of Air France's crews,

6
00:01:43,822 --> 00:01:47,428
was inspired by the final
episode of the picture.

7
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,026
Calling Dakar Control!

8
00:02:24,256 --> 00:02:26,845
This is the USS Mariner
Rescue, come in!

9
00:02:27,532 --> 00:02:29,150
Calling Dakar Control!

10
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:34,419
Airborne Marine Rescue,
repeat: F-BARJ.

11
00:02:34,645 --> 00:02:38,234
It's located 15 kilometers south
of Cape Cisneros.

12
00:02:38,529 --> 00:02:40,662
Looks like the plane
has crashed.

13
00:02:40,978 --> 00:02:44,061
There are two men lying motionless
two men lying motionless.

14
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:46,587
Send help right away!

15
00:03:32,265 --> 00:03:34,268
Well! It's crazy!

16
00:03:34,268 --> 00:03:35,718
In a coma?!

17
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:37,475
I've never seen anything like it in my life!

18
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:39,643
They're drunk as pigs!

19
00:03:42,465 --> 00:03:44,195
What a shame...

20
00:03:45,227 --> 00:03:48,033
No, look at that drunken face
at that drunken face!

21
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:49,907
This is what we came here for?!

22
00:03:49,907 --> 00:03:51,487
They're lying dead!

23
00:03:51,705 --> 00:03:53,447
Come on, get up!
Get up!

24
00:03:53,628 --> 00:03:55,117
Get the stretcher over here!

25
00:03:55,117 --> 00:03:56,588
Get up, you hear me?!

26
00:03:56,588 --> 00:03:58,198
Not even a fracture...

27
00:03:58,198 --> 00:03:59,990
A couple aspirin tablets will suffice.

28
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:01,767
I'm going to give it to them!

29
00:04:03,607 --> 00:04:05,211
What were they carrying, these knuckleheads?

30
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,879
Liquor, Mr. Major!

31
00:04:12,156 --> 00:04:15,289
Well, what's the matter with you
happened to you?

32
00:04:16,535 --> 00:04:18,413
Oil pressure
has dropped to zero.

33
00:04:18,486 --> 00:04:20,040
I had to sit down.

34
00:04:20,155 --> 00:04:23,455
The airplane is junk!
It's a piece of junk!

35
00:04:23,455 --> 00:04:28,458
We didn't know what to do...
in the desert. how to have fun.

36
00:04:28,637 --> 00:04:32,512
So. while we were waiting.

37
00:04:32,755 --> 00:04:34,998
Pulled the plugs.

38
00:04:42,776 --> 00:04:45,100
What are you laughing at, old man?

39
00:04:45,548 --> 00:04:47,367
Same as you!

40
00:04:50,771 --> 00:04:53,861
Do you think the landlord
the landlord throw us out?

41
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,017
What are you doing? He wouldn't dare!

42
00:05:12,751 --> 00:05:15,269
No, man, no!
Quit drinking!

43
00:05:15,677 --> 00:05:18,702
So here are your tickets.
And your money.

44
00:05:18,702 --> 00:05:19,776
It wasn't easy...

45
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,632
We leave in an hour:
don't drink any more!

46
00:05:21,632 --> 00:05:24,630
Oh, Pierre! - Before the flight.
don't joke around, don't piss off the company.

47
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,404
Don't be stupid and take care
and take care of yourselves!

48
00:05:26,603 --> 00:05:28,356
Come on, buddy, come on!

49
00:05:28,604 --> 00:05:30,351
We were lucky, after all,
to have met him.

50
00:05:30,351 --> 00:05:33,612
He was luckier! We
We met a friend, and he met two.

51
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,246
He's certainly got the upper hand.
I guess I'm a little short.

52
00:05:36,246 --> 00:05:37,712
Hey, do it again for two!

53
00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:41,888
Here you go!
- Thank you!

54
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:45,108
Is that for me? - Yes, Captain.
Diplomatic pouch.

55
00:05:45,108 --> 00:05:46,909
All right, we'll take care of her
we'll take care of her!

56
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:48,379
Mademoiselle Mani!

57
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:49,847
Diplomatic mail is
of the utmost importance!

58
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:52,681
Do not use for cigars!
- We'll see to that!

59
00:05:53,648 --> 00:05:55,250
Do you have a minute?
- Uh, yeah.

60
00:05:58,837 --> 00:06:00,679
There will be two additional
passengers.

61
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:02,637
These are my friends--
nice guys.

62
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,221
They've been through
a serious blow,

63
00:06:05,221 --> 00:06:06,751
and I'm asking you
to take care of them,

64
00:06:06,751 --> 00:06:09,217
because they're a little
a little tipsy because they had a little too much to drink.

65
00:06:09,217 --> 00:06:10,951
I'm gonna put them
in the last row.

66
00:06:10,951 --> 00:06:12,172
Those bastards!

67
00:06:12,235 --> 00:06:13,959
What? They just keep drinking.

68
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,947
On board, just juice
and vittel water.

69
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,521
Aubrey!
- Yeah, I'm coming!

70
00:06:17,521 --> 00:06:20,859
If they demand beer
or whiskey, call me!

71
00:06:43,353 --> 00:06:45,061
Attention! Attention!

72
00:06:45,061 --> 00:06:48,891
Air France passengers,
traveling to Casablanca and Paris,

73
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:51,925
please come forward for boarding!

74
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:06,867
Bonjour, mademoiselle!

75
00:07:06,867 --> 00:07:09,264
So you're coming with us?
- As you can see!

76
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:12,783
How did you like it this time in Dakar,
did you enjoy it? - The usual.

77
00:07:13,258 --> 00:07:14,698
Then the usual!

78
00:07:14,698 --> 00:07:17,278
You shouldn't have. You really shouldn't have.

79
00:07:36,937 --> 00:07:38,480
Your belt, monsieur!

80
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,027
Mademoiselle, may I have a word
a word? - Yes, sir.

81
00:07:50,157 --> 00:07:54,733
It's about the stroke, actually.
- Very well, monsieur, I'll take it under advisement.

82
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:56,691
Oh, no, no, no, no!
No "all right, monsieur"!

83
00:07:56,691 --> 00:07:58,202
Just in case...

84
00:07:58,202 --> 00:08:00,124
find it in this
pocket. see.

85
00:08:00,124 --> 00:08:01,948
brand new razor...

86
00:08:02,088 --> 00:08:06,998
You're going to oblige me by making
a small incision on my earlobe.

87
00:08:07,118 --> 00:08:09,690
Do you understand? - You must rely
on me, sir. - Thank you!

88
00:08:14,366 --> 00:08:15,928
Your belt, monsieur!

89
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:18,978
All right, master!
Where have I seen her.

90
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,288
Who?
- The stewardess.

91
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,628
I don't know her.
- I don't know her at all.

92
00:08:31,628 --> 00:08:33,147
So what?!

93
00:08:33,627 --> 00:08:36,749
I have a lot of memories,
but I've forgotten them all.

94
00:09:39,739 --> 00:09:42,387
Would you like to come
sit next to me for a while?

95
00:09:42,387 --> 00:09:43,761
I'd love to!

96
00:09:46,114 --> 00:09:48,258
You know, I really love
this town, it's, uh.

97
00:09:48,882 --> 00:09:50,495
I have my habits.

98
00:09:50,986 --> 00:09:52,942
I don't know why, but.

99
00:09:52,942 --> 00:09:56,232
you make me feel
safe.

100
00:09:57,507 --> 00:09:59,094
Life is a strange thing!

101
00:09:59,859 --> 00:10:01,877
Once upon a time.
I lived in Montmorency,

102
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:05,923
I used to ride every morning
on the 8:12 train.

103
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:11,281
and every morning I'd see the same people
in the same compartment every morning.

104
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:15,325
And in this airplane.
something similar.

105
00:10:15,632 --> 00:10:19,354
It's awful what these commuter trains
these commuter trains have gotten!

106
00:10:20,003 --> 00:10:22,519
Do you at least occasionally
change your route.

107
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:24,358
and fly one day
Somewhere in the--

108
00:10:34,168 --> 00:10:36,981
See you later!
- At the little bistro?

109
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:38,613
The usual.

110
00:10:38,613 --> 00:10:40,884
Don't say that
that horrible word!

111
00:10:40,884 --> 00:10:42,938
What's the word?
- "Usually."

112
00:10:43,827 --> 00:10:46,455
See you at the little
bistro. Not the usual!

113
00:10:47,052 --> 00:10:48,760
We're going to be eating
brand-new dishes.

114
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,254
and exchanging completely
unprecedented kisses.

115
00:10:55,191 --> 00:10:56,862
You know, I'd like to, uh.

116
00:10:56,862 --> 00:11:00,420
at any given moment to think that we've only
we've only known each other a couple hours.

117
00:11:03,176 --> 00:11:04,922
You think I'm stupid?

118
00:11:06,196 --> 00:11:08,026
But I don't have time for calculations.

119
00:11:11,947 --> 00:11:14,385
I feel like
you've fallen in love for the first time.

120
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,009
Do you understand?

121
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:33,409
Our love should always
to be like an adventure.

122
00:11:40,396 --> 00:11:43,920
You--
- What?

123
00:11:45,849 --> 00:11:47,079
I adore you!

124
00:11:48,611 --> 00:11:52,265
Are you going to sleep here? - If you know everything
in advance, what kind of adventure is it?

125
00:12:08,804 --> 00:12:10,163
See you tonight!

126
00:12:12,252 --> 00:12:13,532
So what?

127
00:12:14,346 --> 00:12:15,906
Nothing. See you tonight!

128
00:12:26,221 --> 00:12:28,275
I'm sorry, I forgot something.

129
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:56,416
He won't come now!
He could have called you.

130
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:57,773
Maybe he tried.

131
00:12:57,773 --> 00:12:59,583
Men are all made of the same
are all made of the same dough.

132
00:12:59,739 --> 00:13:01,755
Mrs. Bastide!
Pepper, please!

133
00:13:01,755 --> 00:13:04,498
May I? In the whole house.
there's not a pepper shaker left in the whole house.

134
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,481
Mr. Jacques picked up
picked up the last one.

135
00:13:07,481 --> 00:13:10,568
If he deigns to return it,
it would do me a great favor.

136
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,762
Now, you'll notice that I realize that
every client has their own quirks.

137
00:13:13,762 --> 00:13:17,185
One has corkscrews,
the other has ashtrays.

138
00:13:17,188 --> 00:13:20,872
One colonel even stole a coffee grinder
even stole a coffee grinder right in front of me!

139
00:13:20,872 --> 00:13:23,074
And he's got the Legion of Honor
of the Legion of Honor!

140
00:13:23,758 --> 00:13:25,054
Thank you.

141
00:13:25,236 --> 00:13:27,801
I gotta go. Uh, just hold this table for me
this table for me tonight, okay?

142
00:13:27,801 --> 00:13:31,009
If he happens to call,
tell him I'm on Segur 23-15.

143
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:32,229
All right. Uh-huh.

144
00:13:39,364 --> 00:13:42,493
Stop it, stop it!
Fernanda, please laugh alone!

145
00:13:45,828 --> 00:13:47,365
Hey, you, there, stop it!

146
00:13:47,365 --> 00:13:49,072
Be quiet. Now...
Laugh!

147
00:13:50,965 --> 00:13:54,695
No, that's not it. It's too serious!
Laughter is light and fun!

148
00:13:55,225 --> 00:13:58,496
You have to laugh freely,
with the laughter of happy people!

149
00:13:59,853 --> 00:14:01,129
Ah, there you are!

150
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:03,237
Take your time, okay.

151
00:14:03,762 --> 00:14:05,207
No, no, no, don't rush!

152
00:14:05,382 --> 00:14:07,314
I'm sorry we're
got here on time.

153
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,806
We can keep going, can't we?

154
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:12,083
We're not bothering you,
are we? Then fine!

155
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,115
So, let's get on with it!
Where was I?

156
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:16,751
What was I saying?

157
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,649
You tell me what it's about!

158
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:21,765
Nico! Where was I?

159
00:14:23,007 --> 00:14:26,192
Oh, yes. yes, yes! You were saying
how healthy people laugh.

160
00:14:26,192 --> 00:14:27,417
That's great!

161
00:14:27,528 --> 00:14:29,972
Someone who has a good laugh,
isn't always a good actor,

162
00:14:29,972 --> 00:14:32,013
but the ability to laugh
is often necessary.

163
00:14:32,013 --> 00:14:33,454
Let's move on to another topic!

164
00:14:33,631 --> 00:14:35,040
Let's take-- Claire!

165
00:14:36,148 --> 00:14:39,160
If you would do us the honor
and take a few minutes,

166
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,216
to show off your talents,
you're going to make me very happy.

167
00:14:42,523 --> 00:14:43,777
Come on, come here!

168
00:14:45,737 --> 00:14:47,419
So, uh. look at me!

169
00:14:48,878 --> 00:14:50,496
She's not bad at all!

170
00:14:50,896 --> 00:14:52,871
She's late,
but she's worth something.

171
00:14:53,469 --> 00:14:55,647
Look over there!
Over there!

172
00:14:55,789 --> 00:14:59,138
From that look, you're able
to determine her virtues.

173
00:14:59,138 --> 00:15:00,244
and her weaknesses?

174
00:15:00,257 --> 00:15:01,853
Just like that,
by eye?

175
00:15:01,922 --> 00:15:03,308
Sweet!
- Mysterious!

176
00:15:03,308 --> 00:15:04,668
Smart!

177
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:06,783
Restrained!

178
00:15:06,943 --> 00:15:08,295
Sensual!

179
00:15:08,514 --> 00:15:11,067
Sensual, sensual...
Who can say it better?

180
00:15:11,192 --> 00:15:12,816
Melancholy!

181
00:15:13,773 --> 00:15:16,119
Innocent!
- Her role?

182
00:15:16,642 --> 00:15:17,958
A stealthy ingénue!

183
00:15:19,407 --> 00:15:22,399
A secretive ingénue? Not at all!
She's in love!

184
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,398
Romantic in love!

185
00:15:26,043 --> 00:15:27,498
Who are you, monsieur?

186
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:30,763
It's not like you're on the roster
in this class! - No.

187
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,535
So what are you doing here?
You were walking by.

188
00:15:34,535 --> 00:15:36,807
and decided to come in.
not a bad idea at all!

189
00:15:37,421 --> 00:15:39,194
an opportune occasion.
soft grass...

190
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,401
Please make yourselves
make yourselves at home!

191
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:44,033
It's very kind of you
that you stopped by!

192
00:15:44,033 --> 00:15:46,280
I have a few words
a word with Mademoiselle Mani.

193
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:48,514
What?! You're my date
making dates with me now?

194
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:50,806
You could have just
bring you back to your bedroom.

195
00:15:51,431 --> 00:15:52,964
All right, say your piece!

196
00:15:53,675 --> 00:15:56,901
Go! And if you get the chance.
come back to us!

197
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,491
So, where was I?

198
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:00,281
At "very kind,
that you stopped by!"

199
00:16:10,015 --> 00:16:11,735
I came from Jacques.

200
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:16,241
Did something happen to him?
- No, nothing serious.

201
00:16:16,396 --> 00:16:18,558
Nothing serious?
Is he hurt?

202
00:16:18,558 --> 00:16:21,249
No, he wasn't hurt at all.
Why would he be hurt?

203
00:16:23,202 --> 00:16:25,346
He must have told you
to you about me? About Paul?

204
00:16:25,346 --> 00:16:26,739
No. Why?

205
00:16:26,739 --> 00:16:29,009
Except for the jokes?
- No kidding.

206
00:16:29,542 --> 00:16:31,512
That's great!

207
00:16:31,512 --> 00:16:33,115
He told me about you
he told me about you!

208
00:16:33,266 --> 00:16:35,878
We should have had lunch
together, but we didn't!

209
00:16:36,357 --> 00:16:37,909
This is ridiculous!

210
00:16:40,731 --> 00:16:42,481
So what are you here for?

211
00:16:42,994 --> 00:16:45,283
I came from Jacques.
- I get it. What's next?

212
00:16:45,655 --> 00:16:48,148
First of all, he apologizes
for not showing up for lunch.

213
00:16:49,124 --> 00:16:51,108
Well, there's no way he could have
told you about me!

214
00:16:51,108 --> 00:16:54,588
What a strange guy: as soon as he says goodbye to you.
as soon as he says goodbye to you, he forgets!

215
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:57,465
I love him, that's clear, otherwise
I wouldn't be here right now.

216
00:16:57,788 --> 00:17:00,598
Well, uh. I've been thinking all along the way
about how to tell you.

217
00:17:00,598 --> 00:17:02,683
And when I came here, it was over!
I can't say a word.

218
00:17:02,683 --> 00:17:04,526
Mind you, I could have
not care about that,

219
00:17:04,526 --> 00:17:05,984
because I won't see you
You'll never see me again.

220
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:07,300
So be it!

221
00:17:08,821 --> 00:17:10,923
He's not coming over
to have dinner with you tonight.

222
00:17:10,923 --> 00:17:12,643
And on other nights too!

223
00:17:12,643 --> 00:17:14,373
He doesn't care about that!

224
00:17:14,843 --> 00:17:17,552
And don't look at me
like it's my fault!

225
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,027
I'm an honest man, and I'm fed up
and I'm fed up with other people's misdeeds,

226
00:17:21,027 --> 00:17:22,514
that I don't do myself!

227
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,985
Calm down. And give me
me your hand!

228
00:17:27,153 --> 00:17:28,627
It doesn't matter at all!

229
00:17:29,503 --> 00:17:31,683
Wow!
You're unusual.

230
00:17:34,015 --> 00:17:36,550
Is he leaving?
Where's he going? - Dakar.

231
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,846
I'm tired of pretending
of pretending to be an air cab.

232
00:17:38,846 --> 00:17:40,965
Found a company in Senegal
a company called CAFA.

233
00:17:40,965 --> 00:17:43,901
"African Air Transportation Company
air transportation company.

234
00:17:43,901 --> 00:17:46,889
Flying among the Moors
it will change our minds.

235
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:49,603
I'm a mechanic, and he
could have told you that.

236
00:17:50,427 --> 00:17:52,677
И... how long had he been
this negotiation?

237
00:17:52,677 --> 00:17:55,397
Yes! Two months. And four
four days ago, I got an answer.

238
00:17:57,642 --> 00:17:59,096
Well, that's great!

239
00:17:59,104 --> 00:18:01,034
When do you leave?
- Two hours from Orly.

240
00:18:01,034 --> 00:18:02,850
Anyway, you came in
at the last minute.

241
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,871
Yeah, but not because, uh.
- Because there's nothing you can do?

242
00:18:06,015 --> 00:18:08,051
You've got it all planned out,
my admiration!

243
00:18:09,287 --> 00:18:11,588
What's that with you?
What's that look on your face?

244
00:18:11,684 --> 00:18:13,238
Shake it up!

245
00:18:13,238 --> 00:18:15,135
No, it's fine!

246
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:18,445
I thought, "She'll do what everyone else does,
"maybe slap me around a little bit,

247
00:18:18,445 --> 00:18:20,550
and be done with it!"
You've stumped me!

248
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,049
At least you're smart.

249
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:24,904
I'm sure if he knew
if he knew how sensible you are.

250
00:18:25,044 --> 00:18:29,356
Well, what's done is done,
and we won't go back to that.

251
00:18:32,126 --> 00:18:34,652
If you want, I can give him
I can give him a message.

252
00:18:37,276 --> 00:18:38,976
Have a safe trip!

253
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,805
I will. I will!

254
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,102
And thanks again!

255
00:18:45,674 --> 00:18:47,384
You're welcome!

256
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,142
Cab!

257
00:20:49,851 --> 00:20:51,348
What will be mademoiselle?

258
00:20:52,792 --> 00:20:54,164
Cognac.

259
00:20:56,008 --> 00:20:57,608
A bottle of Perrier, Leon!

260
00:21:33,886 --> 00:21:34,980
Hey, you?!

261
00:21:56,734 --> 00:21:58,398
Well, that's it...

262
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:01,056
Lie down for a night -
and you're good to go!

263
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,802
Shouldn't we be warning someone
to warn someone?

264
00:22:10,224 --> 00:22:11,465
No?

265
00:22:11,654 --> 00:22:13,210
You don't need anything?

266
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,822
Would you prefer
to stay here?

267
00:22:22,115 --> 00:22:25,907
Great! If there's anything
if you need anything, don't hesitate!

268
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:27,743
Chief Stewardess Marigny.

269
00:23:23,312 --> 00:23:25,184
And that's why you
you wanted to die?!

270
00:23:25,509 --> 00:23:27,243
Sounds like a femme fatale...

271
00:23:27,243 --> 00:23:28,591
Handsome, isn't he?

272
00:23:29,131 --> 00:23:30,621
Drink up!

273
00:23:31,904 --> 00:23:33,375
And don't worry!

274
00:23:33,486 --> 00:23:35,066
I'll keep your secret.

275
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,854
You don't have to worry
because of some fool!

276
00:23:36,854 --> 00:23:38,085
Drink up...

277
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:42,336
Tasteless?

278
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,406
Here, take
a lump of sugar!

279
00:23:46,204 --> 00:23:48,042
Anyway,
the play is over.

280
00:23:48,042 --> 00:23:50,891
You'll make me happy
if you live. And you will live!

281
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:54,836
A little later, when you've come to your senses
we'll discuss it.

282
00:23:54,836 --> 00:23:56,436
The future awaits you!

283
00:23:56,944 --> 00:23:59,505
...If you know English,
is never bored.

284
00:24:00,781 --> 00:24:02,402
And I speak
in English.

285
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,870
There's a great way
a great way

286
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,730
to have an English mistress.

287
00:24:10,059 --> 00:24:11,889
I have a girlfriend--
a lovely girl.

288
00:24:11,889 --> 00:24:13,735
Excellent girl!

289
00:24:14,689 --> 00:24:16,829
While I was with her,
and I learned English.

290
00:24:17,684 --> 00:24:19,346
I'm a fast learner, though.

291
00:24:20,998 --> 00:24:23,544
I just crushed
that English.

292
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,304
How funny!

293
00:24:25,304 --> 00:24:28,523
We arrive in an hour, sorry!
- Yes, yes, go about your business, please!

294
00:24:39,985 --> 00:24:41,319
Claire!

295
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,235
Claire!

296
00:24:48,421 --> 00:24:49,745
I'm sorry, please!

297
00:24:49,745 --> 00:24:51,419
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you at first,

298
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:53,465
but it's so weird.
to meet here.

299
00:24:53,717 --> 00:24:55,451
Just think about it!
You're the last one...

300
00:24:55,451 --> 00:24:57,977
The last woman
I knew before I left.

301
00:24:57,977 --> 00:25:01,259
And the first one I met.
coming back after three years!

302
00:25:01,659 --> 00:25:03,178
Isn't that great?

303
00:25:05,201 --> 00:25:06,516
Jacques!

304
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:08,566
You don't remember me?

305
00:25:08,857 --> 00:25:10,167
Jacques.

306
00:25:11,171 --> 00:25:13,315
Well, answer me
something!

307
00:25:14,528 --> 00:25:16,945
You're right: it is
incredibly funny!

308
00:25:17,294 --> 00:25:18,769
You could have said hello to me
to say hello,

309
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:20,479
if you saw that
I didn't recognize you.

310
00:25:21,387 --> 00:25:23,246
Especially since I'm with Paul!

311
00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:26,387
With Paul?
- Well, yes! Yes! With Paul!

312
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:28,989
Paul admired you so much!

313
00:25:28,989 --> 00:25:31,430
You know, I've often thought
about you. You have!

314
00:25:31,547 --> 00:25:35,092
And to meet you here,
today. is a sign for me!

315
00:25:35,207 --> 00:25:37,263
I don't believe in accidents.

316
00:25:37,417 --> 00:25:39,510
If we're meeting
now, it means, uh.

317
00:25:40,027 --> 00:25:43,743
But, uh. really. what made you
did you choose this profession?

318
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:47,075
Didn't you have, uh.
a different calling, didn't you?

319
00:25:47,075 --> 00:25:48,576
Yes. Theater!

320
00:25:48,651 --> 00:25:50,306
Are you still
living on Charles-Mont?

321
00:25:50,388 --> 00:25:52,035
Oh, Rue Charles-Monet!

322
00:25:52,102 --> 00:25:53,612
Claire, I want to kiss you!

323
00:25:53,612 --> 00:25:55,917
You should go back to your seat.
It was good to see you!

324
00:25:55,917 --> 00:25:57,831
Oh, don't talk to me like that!

325
00:25:58,113 --> 00:26:00,196
Do I mean anything to you
I mean something to you!

326
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:03,504
And then, uh. after everything.
you remember me like the others.

327
00:26:03,504 --> 00:26:05,891
You said "like the others."
I'm sorry!

328
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:27,233
Claire!

329
00:26:27,233 --> 00:26:28,956
The stewardess is Claire!

330
00:26:29,328 --> 00:26:31,542
Yes, yes, yes, yes! I assure you.
it's Claire!

331
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,445
Is that what you think?

332
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:22,771
What will it be, Mademoiselle Mani?

333
00:27:22,771 --> 00:27:26,299
Cognac.
Oh, yes. Cognac!

334
00:27:31,553 --> 00:27:33,120
What are you doing here alone?

335
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,825
You're drinking cognac?!

336
00:27:34,825 --> 00:27:36,760
Isn't that amazing?
- Yes!

337
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:38,920
Why?

338
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,809
It's weird seeing you
alone in a bar.

339
00:27:40,809 --> 00:27:42,713
when I just saw
something incredible!

340
00:27:43,693 --> 00:27:45,147
What's unbelievable?

341
00:27:45,147 --> 00:27:48,003
I can't say.
Pay up and let's go!

342
00:27:49,264 --> 00:27:51,347
Well, are you coming?
The car's waiting.

343
00:27:51,347 --> 00:27:52,773
Does that remind you of anything?

344
00:27:52,773 --> 00:27:55,083
How do you know?
- It's not hard to guess!

345
00:27:56,361 --> 00:27:58,984
Uh, do you drink cognac?
- She drank to her memories.

346
00:27:59,368 --> 00:28:02,563
Aha! I couldn't get away
from those two guys! - You didn't?

347
00:28:03,266 --> 00:28:05,862
They've been asking me
a bunch of questions about you.

348
00:28:06,116 --> 00:28:08,778
These two are friends of mine from the war.
from the war, the good guys!

349
00:28:12,406 --> 00:28:15,346
So you met!
What did he say to you?

350
00:28:15,346 --> 00:28:18,507
Who? - Don't make me
a fool! Forestier.

351
00:28:44,815 --> 00:28:46,609
Well, there you go.
- Thank you.

352
00:28:47,975 --> 00:28:50,688
Why don't we have dinner together?
- Oh, no, I'm exhausted.

353
00:28:51,785 --> 00:28:54,207
I need a shower
and my bed.

354
00:28:59,951 --> 00:29:01,309
Going to your place?

355
00:29:01,886 --> 00:29:03,896
Oh, mademoiselle, first.
I'll take my things first,

356
00:29:03,896 --> 00:29:06,037
and then, if I'm not too
tired, I'll go for a drink.

357
00:29:06,037 --> 00:29:07,792
with two of your fans.

358
00:29:09,021 --> 00:29:10,658
I don't know what you
told them on the flight,

359
00:29:10,658 --> 00:29:12,413
but you made quite an impression
a big impression.

360
00:29:12,413 --> 00:29:13,971
Especially on Forestier.

361
00:29:13,971 --> 00:29:15,349
Huge!

362
00:29:15,464 --> 00:29:17,442
Will you see them?

363
00:29:17,442 --> 00:29:20,019
They want me to help them
them back into the company.

364
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:22,478
If only they'd pour
more water in their wine!

365
00:29:23,362 --> 00:29:25,396
Good night!
- Can I carry your suitcase?

366
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:27,427
No, monsieur, thank you.
See you tomorrow!

367
00:29:29,859 --> 00:29:31,691
Why are you looking
looking at me like that?

368
00:29:31,691 --> 00:29:35,800
You look unusual.
You seem upset about something.

369
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,185
Only by my fatigue!

370
00:29:39,241 --> 00:29:41,006
Then get a good night's rest!

371
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:01,120
Hey, time to get up!

372
00:30:03,266 --> 00:30:05,954
So, uh. What's the matter?

373
00:30:05,954 --> 00:30:08,721
Who sleeps till noon
at your age?!

374
00:30:08,721 --> 00:30:12,882
The maid has to clean
the bedrooms! Hey, get up!

375
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,190
Oh, you look great!

376
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,187
No, I mean, what's the big deal
dragging people around.

377
00:30:17,187 --> 00:30:19,173
without warning
from your own bed?!

378
00:30:19,173 --> 00:30:22,352
You're gonna have a heart attack!
- Hold this!

379
00:30:22,924 --> 00:30:24,336
Good morning, Philippines!

380
00:30:24,336 --> 00:30:27,224
Why do you call him that?
- He's got a chubby ass.

381
00:30:28,065 --> 00:30:32,025
Hey, uh, this is the same room
where I lived three years ago.

382
00:30:32,025 --> 00:30:35,625
I recognized it after all! - Huh, and it's still
the ring on the curtain is missing!

383
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,834
Here, drink this!
It'll help you.

384
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,958
What is it?
- Aspirin.

385
00:30:41,122 --> 00:30:43,729
Yeah, there's someone downstairs
looking for you. I'll go get them.

386
00:30:50,823 --> 00:30:52,642
Lorette's mom hasn't changed.....

387
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,354
That's just the way it is!

388
00:30:57,521 --> 00:31:00,776
To think of it. Claire!
- So?

389
00:31:01,958 --> 00:31:03,716
Nice girl.
- О!

390
00:31:04,465 --> 00:31:06,414
That's better, guys!

391
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,362
Oh, it's Kiki!

392
00:31:11,183 --> 00:31:12,585
Hey, me first!
- No!

393
00:31:12,585 --> 00:31:15,079
He's been nicer to me
nicer to me than you!

394
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:19,402
So much for getting even with me!

395
00:31:19,402 --> 00:31:20,869
It's so good to see you!

396
00:31:20,869 --> 00:31:23,891
You still live here?
- Yes. And still in the same room.

397
00:31:23,977 --> 00:31:26,516
Oh, you're here!
You found them.

398
00:31:27,206 --> 00:31:29,143
She will not relinquish her place
on a cannonball!

399
00:31:29,143 --> 00:31:31,298
What the hell is that?
- Your suitcase.

400
00:31:31,298 --> 00:31:34,164
You left it in my custody
three years ago. It's an honest home!

401
00:31:34,164 --> 00:31:36,293
Nothing important...
But thanks anyway!

402
00:31:37,411 --> 00:31:38,651
Oh, boy!

403
00:31:43,164 --> 00:31:44,394
You're such a slob!

404
00:31:51,163 --> 00:31:52,675
Wow, that's funny!

405
00:31:53,034 --> 00:31:56,183
Did you collect pepperoni?
- Monsieur's secret passion...

406
00:31:56,183 --> 00:31:57,488
Cretin!

407
00:31:57,996 --> 00:31:59,536
Oh, I remember...

408
00:31:59,771 --> 00:32:02,582
When we went to the dance,
I gave one of these to Claire.

409
00:32:05,587 --> 00:32:06,981
Will you give it to me?

410
00:32:06,981 --> 00:32:09,721
Well, it's a souvenir.
- So give it to me as a souvenir!

411
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:11,359
Here you go!
- Thanks, Paul!

412
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:13,505
Anyway, I don't owe you
I don't owe you anything, and that's fine!

413
00:32:14,417 --> 00:32:15,857
Tell me something.
- What?

414
00:32:16,186 --> 00:32:19,199
Let's go out to dinner tonight.
all three of us.

415
00:32:26,976 --> 00:32:31,087
Oh, Mr. Jacques!
What a surprise!

416
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,099
That's so sweet! Especially since
we've had everything taken away!

417
00:32:37,099 --> 00:32:40,059
I'd like to introduce my friends:
Mademoiselle Ketty, Monsieur Paul!

418
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:41,957
It's a pleasure!
- Nice to meet you, too.

419
00:32:47,802 --> 00:32:49,453
Well, what good things
to offer us?

420
00:32:49,453 --> 00:32:51,167
I'm starving!

421
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,259
What, we're out of rooster in wine?
But it's the rooster in the wine that I want!

422
00:32:54,259 --> 00:32:56,397
He always wants
for something he doesn't have!

423
00:32:56,397 --> 00:32:58,664
There's still
some rooster in the wine!

424
00:32:58,664 --> 00:33:01,124
I'm telling you I don't!

425
00:33:02,466 --> 00:33:06,135
Good afternoon, Mrs. Bastide!
- Oh, Mr. Jacques!

426
00:33:06,235 --> 00:33:09,325
How wonderful!
Wait, I'll wipe my hands.

427
00:33:09,898 --> 00:33:12,095
Who have you become
in that time?

428
00:33:12,095 --> 00:33:13,993
A lover of rooster in wine....

429
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,577
What are you looking for?

430
00:33:16,687 --> 00:33:18,314
Oh, this is just what I was looking for!

431
00:33:18,574 --> 00:33:19,914
Terrible!

432
00:33:20,237 --> 00:33:22,732
After all, it's not every day
every day you come back after three years!

433
00:33:22,857 --> 00:33:26,399
You know she's here?
Have you seen her? - I knew it!

434
00:33:41,611 --> 00:33:42,939
It's me again!

435
00:33:44,349 --> 00:33:45,635
I know: I heard you.

436
00:33:45,635 --> 00:33:47,627
Do you mind if I, uh.
if I sit at your table?

437
00:33:47,627 --> 00:33:49,348
Besides, I'm done with dinner.

438
00:33:49,348 --> 00:33:51,320
You didn't forget about my
dessert? - Uh, no.

439
00:33:53,067 --> 00:33:54,492
What have you been reading?

440
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:57,245
Oh, very nice...

441
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:00,102
Come on, tell me!

442
00:34:00,188 --> 00:34:02,376
But first. first.
look at me!

443
00:34:03,381 --> 00:34:05,257
You haven't aged a bit.

444
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,977
What about me? How do you find me?

445
00:34:08,871 --> 00:34:11,003
What have I done to you?!

446
00:34:11,526 --> 00:34:13,278
Are you gonna act like you did yesterday?

447
00:34:13,278 --> 00:34:16,667
You can't be mad at me
just because I didn't recognize you!

448
00:34:17,913 --> 00:34:20,875
If I'd only been told
that I'd meet you as a stewardess!

449
00:34:21,053 --> 00:34:23,016
Bring me, too.
strawberries and sugar and the bill!

450
00:34:23,016 --> 00:34:25,043
We're not gonna stay
here all night, are we?

451
00:34:25,457 --> 00:34:27,412
Are you still
not drinking coffee? See?!

452
00:34:27,412 --> 00:34:28,798
I remember that!

453
00:34:28,798 --> 00:34:30,820
It's like you never
never left my side.

454
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,327
Coffee, as usual.
- Two coffees!

455
00:34:34,312 --> 00:34:37,475
How funny! And here I thought
you hated coffee.

456
00:34:37,864 --> 00:34:39,682
You can have dinner without me!

457
00:34:39,682 --> 00:34:41,223
We weren't expecting you!

458
00:34:41,223 --> 00:34:42,809
Come over here!

459
00:34:45,645 --> 00:34:47,613
He's overreacting...

460
00:34:48,036 --> 00:34:50,285
I am a woman after all.
- Yes, you are!

461
00:34:50,846 --> 00:34:53,391
You're not interested
how I lived after you?

462
00:34:54,847 --> 00:34:57,379
In fact, how long have we
were together? A month?

463
00:34:57,379 --> 00:34:58,787
8 days.

464
00:34:58,787 --> 00:35:01,908
No?! How much we've accomplished
we've accomplished in eight days!

465
00:35:01,908 --> 00:35:03,579
We went to a dance,

466
00:35:03,579 --> 00:35:05,743
taking pictures at the fairgrounds
near the Invalides.

467
00:35:05,743 --> 00:35:07,737
See? I didn't forget anything!

468
00:35:07,737 --> 00:35:10,452
And the night at the Merano Circus.
Remember that too?

469
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:13,123
Of course I remember!
- Liar!

470
00:35:13,123 --> 00:35:14,809
Our feet were never there!

471
00:35:15,635 --> 00:35:17,923
And I feel like
like we've been there too.

472
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,912
Since yesterday. I've been thinking
of you. incessantly!

473
00:35:22,237 --> 00:35:23,599
No, no, that's right!

474
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,589
I can even think of
a lot of tiny details.

475
00:35:26,718 --> 00:35:30,948
Like how you told me
that I was, uh. like I was falling in love for the first time.

476
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,254
You're the one who told me!

477
00:35:33,266 --> 00:35:34,991
I remember, as you can see!

478
00:35:35,689 --> 00:35:37,414
I hope you didn't believe me!

479
00:35:37,414 --> 00:35:40,245
But isn't the fact that I left,
without daring to say goodbye,

480
00:35:40,245 --> 00:35:43,697
doesn't prove that it, uh.
upset me?

481
00:35:43,697 --> 00:35:46,302
But now it's over!
I'm very happy to see you.

482
00:35:46,906 --> 00:35:50,218
It's even better that I made you
forget about the guy who went to Dakar!

483
00:35:50,842 --> 00:35:53,077
I even deserve
respect because, uh.

484
00:35:53,794 --> 00:35:55,633
he was three
three years younger than me!

485
00:35:55,829 --> 00:35:57,204
All right, let's go!

486
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:08,344
See you tomorrow! I'm sorry, Kiki,
you're not mad at me?

487
00:36:08,344 --> 00:36:09,686
What hard feelings?

488
00:36:09,686 --> 00:36:12,064
Paul, you stay for me!
- All right, old boy!

489
00:36:14,615 --> 00:36:16,718
I hate you!

490
00:36:16,956 --> 00:36:19,834
I'll never be able
forget Berenice!

491
00:36:19,834 --> 00:36:21,791
Do you remember how you were
practicing while I was shaving?

492
00:36:22,056 --> 00:36:25,595
Never, ever, ever, ever....

493
00:36:25,595 --> 00:36:28,450
I could not have loved
more tenderly. Never.

494
00:36:28,861 --> 00:36:35,473
...then you're like, "Love me.
me, take care of me!"

495
00:36:35,522 --> 00:36:38,393
And, helpless, I yield to the ingrate,
who leaves me without regret.

496
00:36:38,393 --> 00:36:41,548
Uh, no, no, no, you're cheating!
You just jumped through a whole tirade!

497
00:36:41,548 --> 00:36:43,918
And your poem has
at least three mistakes!

498
00:36:43,918 --> 00:36:45,648
First of all, I'm not ungrateful.

499
00:36:45,648 --> 00:36:47,124
Second, you didn't give in to me.

500
00:36:47,124 --> 00:36:48,548
Third, I didn't leave you.

501
00:36:51,074 --> 00:36:52,569
Claire...

502
00:36:52,569 --> 00:36:53,940
Jacques!

503
00:36:53,974 --> 00:36:55,712
Claire!
- Jacques.

504
00:36:55,712 --> 00:36:57,520
No, don't make fun of me!

505
00:36:57,796 --> 00:37:00,835
We'll be right back
at your house,

506
00:37:00,835 --> 00:37:02,993
as if they'd left him
just this morning.

507
00:37:02,993 --> 00:37:04,627
It was a short day!

508
00:37:04,627 --> 00:37:06,449
I think you're missing something!

509
00:37:07,036 --> 00:37:09,788
What do we do
if we're happy to meet?

510
00:37:09,788 --> 00:37:11,462
Kissing each other?

511
00:37:12,935 --> 00:37:14,340
Good night!

512
00:37:32,678 --> 00:37:34,021
It's me again!

513
00:37:34,021 --> 00:37:36,488
Are you obsessive compulsive?
- I'm here for a kiss,

514
00:37:36,488 --> 00:37:38,729
that you forgot to give me
to give me. - Those cute little amusements.

515
00:37:38,729 --> 00:37:40,350
to Rome. I know!

516
00:37:45,483 --> 00:37:47,798
[Cell phone rings] Hello?
Police? Officer on duty?

517
00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:50,400
What's with the weird reaction?

518
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:53,031
I don't have a choice, unless
you don't realize that, uh.

519
00:37:53,031 --> 00:37:54,736
your presence
makes me uncomfortable.

520
00:37:56,934 --> 00:37:58,486
You're a bad liar!

521
00:37:58,486 --> 00:38:00,830
Too bad for a woman.
- Listen, Jacques.

522
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:03,692
You're a nice guy, but a little too
frivolous for my taste.

523
00:38:03,692 --> 00:38:05,438
It's over
it's over, you know?

524
00:38:05,438 --> 00:38:07,721
I've had enough!
And there's no use insisting!

525
00:38:07,858 --> 00:38:10,505
You're always being cranky.
You want what you don't have.

526
00:38:10,505 --> 00:38:12,717
But I'm no longer
on the map! I'm crossed off!

527
00:38:12,717 --> 00:38:14,987
Stop being angry!

528
00:38:14,987 --> 00:38:17,083
I'm not angry-- that's how much
I don't care about you!

529
00:38:17,083 --> 00:38:19,897
If I loved you.
or if you loved me.

530
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:21,723
I would never forgive you!

531
00:38:28,318 --> 00:38:31,499
Okay, okay. You
you want to seem unapproachable.

532
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,836
It's part of your coquetry.

533
00:38:34,052 --> 00:38:36,978
And I, uh. pretend
that I believe you.

534
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:40,140
Claire hates me.
Claire curses me...

535
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:42,865
Claire is an unapproachable
personality.

536
00:38:42,986 --> 00:38:45,161
Well? Are you satisfied?

537
00:38:45,883 --> 00:38:50,004
And now that your honor
is saved. kiss me!

538
00:38:50,131 --> 00:38:53,161
Get out of here! - How aggressive you are
aggressive tonight!

539
00:38:54,025 --> 00:38:56,306
I was dreaming.
- You don't love me at all!

540
00:38:56,306 --> 00:38:57,982
You mistake love for love
your stubbornness!

541
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:01,093
And yet. now.
I love you!

542
00:39:01,582 --> 00:39:03,222
It's undeniable.

543
00:39:03,955 --> 00:39:05,735
And it feels like
it's forever.

544
00:39:06,189 --> 00:39:07,519
Maybe!

545
00:39:08,582 --> 00:39:10,786
See, I'm being honest with you.

546
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:12,730
This would have been
dreamed of three years ago.

547
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:15,099
But three years ago, I was
I was already in love with you!

548
00:39:15,925 --> 00:39:17,853
Just didn't realize it...

549
00:39:17,853 --> 00:39:19,856
There are some things
we realize later.

550
00:39:19,908 --> 00:39:23,375
You didn't seriously think that
I was gonna wait three years for you?!

551
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:26,903
That I have no one in my life?
- But I'm back!

552
00:39:26,903 --> 00:39:29,841
And away with your paws! You're back,
but the seat's already taken.

553
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:35,537
Who?
Do I know him?

554
00:39:36,394 --> 00:39:37,717
It's possible.

555
00:39:37,717 --> 00:39:40,401
This guy is neither frivolous,
nor empty, nor reckless.

556
00:39:41,136 --> 00:39:42,392
So he's an old man?

557
00:39:43,504 --> 00:39:45,337
You're his age.
You'll never reach his age.

558
00:39:45,337 --> 00:39:46,590
This is the age of reason.

559
00:39:48,343 --> 00:39:49,582
It's not true!

560
00:39:50,923 --> 00:39:52,322
What's his name?

561
00:39:52,905 --> 00:39:55,228
Please leave
things where they belong!

562
00:39:55,708 --> 00:39:57,625
In my day, it was standing
there. - In your time!

563
00:39:57,945 --> 00:39:59,307
Well, let's talk about it!

564
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:01,482
"Hi! Bye!" -
that's our story.

565
00:40:03,325 --> 00:40:05,173
You left just as
I was about to leave.

566
00:40:05,173 --> 00:40:06,666
We owe nothing
to each other.

567
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:08,679
When your friend Paul
came to me with news,

568
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:11,650
there was already a letter in my purse
a letter about our breakup.

569
00:40:13,075 --> 00:40:15,000
The thought came to us
came to us at the same time.

570
00:40:15,019 --> 00:40:17,918
Because I was
so flighty back then.

571
00:40:17,918 --> 00:40:21,325
frivolous.
that I looked like you!

572
00:40:21,631 --> 00:40:23,469
And now, and this is something
you've got to deal with it.

573
00:40:23,469 --> 00:40:25,107
I have a different
outlook on life.

574
00:40:25,107 --> 00:40:26,920
So go away:
you're not for me!

575
00:40:29,497 --> 00:40:31,252
How can anyone take
take you seriously?!

576
00:40:31,252 --> 00:40:34,274
Look at you: Who are you?!
You come in through the window for a joke,

577
00:40:34,274 --> 00:40:35,683
like the hero of an operetta!

578
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,844
But I don't want to have
to have any more fun with you--

579
00:40:37,844 --> 00:40:39,210
go ruin other people's lives!

580
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:40,556
I don't have time!

581
00:40:40,556 --> 00:40:43,242
Go away! The night is long and
full of accidents!

582
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:46,357
You're not saying
what you think you're saying.

583
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,954
Uh, hello?

584
00:41:02,055 --> 00:41:04,299
Hello?
Mr. Aubrey?

585
00:41:04,974 --> 00:41:06,483
Yeah, put me through to him!

586
00:41:07,457 --> 00:41:08,875
Hello, Pierre!

587
00:41:08,955 --> 00:41:11,083
I went straight to
to the phone.

588
00:41:13,361 --> 00:41:15,273
Yeah, I'm alone. Why?

589
00:41:16,573 --> 00:41:18,089
No, there was no one.

590
00:41:19,829 --> 00:41:21,487
What's wrong with my voice?

591
00:41:24,625 --> 00:41:26,460
No, I wasn't asleep.

592
00:41:27,617 --> 00:41:30,434
Yeah, I had dinner at a little restaurant.

593
00:41:31,934 --> 00:41:33,726
I got held up
because of some nerd.

594
00:41:34,456 --> 00:41:36,477
Yeah. childhood friend.

595
00:41:36,716 --> 00:41:39,625
We see each other once every ten years.
He likes to poke me.

596
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:41,375
and remind you of unpleasant things.

597
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,544
Uh, hello?

598
00:41:54,686 --> 00:41:57,480
Oh, I don't know what's
on the line today.

599
00:41:58,284 --> 00:42:00,285
No, no, no, I'm fine
I'm fine.

600
00:42:00,385 --> 00:42:02,314
Just a little tired, that's all.

601
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:07,830
This is what's in your feet, and you can
you can move the cards.

602
00:42:08,543 --> 00:42:10,415
Cover the lady...

603
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:15,619
...then the jack!
- I'd rather cover the brunet.

604
00:42:15,619 --> 00:42:18,776
Shut up! - I don't know what happened to you
this morning! I'm sorry!

605
00:42:18,776 --> 00:42:20,729
But you could have been
a little more polite!

606
00:42:22,295 --> 00:42:24,289
Ketty, would you mind
leave us alone for a minute?

607
00:42:24,289 --> 00:42:26,705
Not at all!
Okay, I get it.

608
00:42:26,705 --> 00:42:28,938
Go get dressed! - Ha, you can
to say more than that!

609
00:42:28,938 --> 00:42:30,307
Come in!

610
00:42:32,526 --> 00:42:36,000
Still in bed? - In order to get him up
I'd have to get up early to get him up before noon.

611
00:42:36,508 --> 00:42:37,750
Well?

612
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,644
So, uh. you've decided
to rejoin the company after all?

613
00:42:41,644 --> 00:42:43,718
Pfft...
- Why not?

614
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:50,982
You don't seem very enthusiastic.
- What do you want us to say?

615
00:42:50,982 --> 00:42:53,998
I gotta be honest, the thought of going back
to the company makes me kind of sad.

616
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:55,727
Life is too measured...

617
00:42:56,089 --> 00:42:58,850
It's like I'm becoming
an aviation desk rat.

618
00:42:59,007 --> 00:43:01,659
Anyway, you've got to live.

619
00:43:02,772 --> 00:43:04,796
At 5:00, I've set up
for you to meet me at the office,

620
00:43:04,796 --> 00:43:07,096
but if you'd like, I can
call and cancel it.

621
00:43:07,096 --> 00:43:08,909
Oh, never mind
the whims of monsieur!

622
00:43:08,909 --> 00:43:11,951
Monsieur has a heartache, Monsieur.
a slap on the nose, monsieur.

623
00:43:11,951 --> 00:43:13,768
Shut up! - But, uh, let me--
- No!

624
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:16,170
I told you to shut up!

625
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:17,654
You got it?!
- Well, what did I say?

626
00:43:17,654 --> 00:43:19,868
It's over, isn't it?
It's over!

627
00:43:22,473 --> 00:43:26,213
Will the internship be serious?
- Very serious! Why?

628
00:43:26,828 --> 00:43:29,134
Well, uh. I'm not sure
I can learn.

629
00:43:29,195 --> 00:43:30,975
You know the basics,
they'll teach you the rest.

630
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:32,787
There is no limit
there's no limit to perfection.

631
00:43:32,787 --> 00:43:34,246
It's gonna be fun!

632
00:43:34,246 --> 00:43:35,879
I've been through it.
Didn't die, as you can see.

633
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:39,052
Don't worry! Our instructors
are friendly and understanding.

634
00:43:39,052 --> 00:43:40,312
You'll see for yourself!

635
00:43:54,162 --> 00:43:55,605
Good afternoon, gentlemen!

636
00:43:55,605 --> 00:43:57,541
I have been entrusted with your training.

637
00:43:57,753 --> 00:43:59,740
You have been accepted
for this internship.

638
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,721
thanks to your experience
from your experience in the military,

639
00:44:01,721 --> 00:44:04,055
in naval aviation and
overseas.

640
00:44:05,038 --> 00:44:06,968
But regardless
of your past.

641
00:44:06,968 --> 00:44:08,873
Or from your experience...

642
00:44:09,589 --> 00:44:11,495
you're on equal footing
on an equal footing.

643
00:44:12,436 --> 00:44:14,833
Initially, I believe
that you don't know anything.

644
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:19,650
I'll start my training from scratch.
- Discipline, discipline...

645
00:44:19,711 --> 00:44:21,601
Mr. Forestier, let's see,
how talkative you'll be,

646
00:44:21,601 --> 00:44:23,388
when it comes to
when it comes to a pilot's knowledge.

647
00:44:23,388 --> 00:44:25,766
In the meantime, I don't require
your comments!

648
00:44:33,749 --> 00:44:35,157
Five more degrees!

649
00:44:36,246 --> 00:44:39,664
Cap!
Can't you feel the wings?

650
00:44:39,757 --> 00:44:41,935
How much longer do you have to be here?
- No. Five minutes.

651
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:44,163
Get back on the beam!

652
00:44:45,741 --> 00:44:48,935
The car's waiting for us. - Do you have a seat
Do you have seats? - Yeah, for two orchestras.

653
00:44:49,991 --> 00:44:51,180
Well, what else?!

654
00:44:51,641 --> 00:44:54,093
What do you mean "what"?!
We're not done!

655
00:44:54,537 --> 00:44:55,820
Close the hatch!

656
00:44:58,418 --> 00:45:00,065
You pass the cone of silence.

657
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:02,122
What's your reaction?

658
00:45:02,925 --> 00:45:05,745
You go to 2,000 feet,
not 1,200. Get back!

659
00:45:06,548 --> 00:45:07,879
Get back on the beam!

660
00:45:07,964 --> 00:45:10,633
What's wrong? - He's in a corkscrew
into a corkscrew, and that's dangerous.

661
00:45:10,761 --> 00:45:12,991
Now you're dead!
Crashed!

662
00:45:13,379 --> 00:45:15,718
You're going into a corkscrew
at 1,000 feet, that's smart!

663
00:45:33,884 --> 00:45:36,317
So, am I still
piloting like a boot?!

664
00:45:36,693 --> 00:45:39,704
And I don't know how to do anything?! Come on,
spit it out, I'll listen!

665
00:45:39,704 --> 00:45:41,367
You have absolutely no self-control
to control yourself.

666
00:45:41,367 --> 00:45:43,329
Yeah, well, now you can
get rid of me!

667
00:45:43,329 --> 00:45:44,434
And I know why!

668
00:45:44,434 --> 00:45:47,330
Come on, let's go! I've lost my
my flying qualifications, right?

669
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:50,371
I agree! But I told you
I warned you that I did everything I could to make this happen!

670
00:45:52,781 --> 00:45:56,064
Like the fact that you can be a good pilot
pilot and the last donkey.

671
00:45:56,685 --> 00:45:58,236
Haven't you realized that yet?

672
00:45:58,329 --> 00:46:00,907
You didn't realize that I was supposed
to pick on you,

673
00:46:00,907 --> 00:46:02,357
to get you
you to pull yourself together?

674
00:46:02,357 --> 00:46:04,791
I wished you success.
There are people in the company...

675
00:46:04,791 --> 00:46:07,153
are demanding and don't like
anyone who tarnishes her reputation.

676
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,725
I would never repeat
such an experience with a friend of mine.

677
00:46:14,531 --> 00:46:16,042
This is beyond me!

678
00:46:17,987 --> 00:46:19,893
I'm even crazier
than you think.

679
00:46:20,368 --> 00:46:22,292
I don't think that's possible.
- And yet!

680
00:46:22,292 --> 00:46:24,034
You should know what I was thinking!

681
00:46:24,034 --> 00:46:26,875
I thought you were jealous.
- Jealous?

682
00:46:26,875 --> 00:46:29,817
Uh, yeah. Because of Claire.

683
00:46:29,817 --> 00:46:31,737
The other day when you
reprimanded me in front of her,

684
00:46:31,737 --> 00:46:33,548
I thought it was on purpose.

685
00:46:33,548 --> 00:46:36,460
I said to myself, "Aubrey, who
who was protecting me, wants to drown me."

686
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,065
Aubrey knew we'd met...

687
00:46:38,365 --> 00:46:40,623
How would I know that?

688
00:46:41,305 --> 00:46:43,165
Claire isn't being honest with me.

689
00:46:43,165 --> 00:46:45,044
There's nothing between us.

690
00:46:45,862 --> 00:46:47,555
Just a little bit of friendship...

691
00:46:48,409 --> 00:46:49,733
As for the rest...

692
00:46:49,733 --> 00:46:51,959
What's the rest of it?
- We switched roles!

693
00:46:52,365 --> 00:46:54,098
You're the one who was jealous of me!

694
00:46:54,567 --> 00:46:57,019
You're a terrific guy!
- Yeah, yeah.

695
00:46:57,201 --> 00:46:59,828
You're the one who could have told me
that you knew me.

696
00:47:00,603 --> 00:47:01,999
What did I look like?!

697
00:47:06,165 --> 00:47:08,774
With your permission, I'll report
to the patron on the results of the training session.

698
00:47:09,089 --> 00:47:10,496
You're not mad at me?

699
00:47:10,629 --> 00:47:12,659
On the contrary, I'm grateful
for what you've done for me.

700
00:47:12,659 --> 00:47:14,930
What did I ever do for you?!

701
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:19,464
Well, let's just say. you've pleased
me as, uh. as an apprentice!

702
00:47:39,014 --> 00:47:40,328
Simone!

703
00:47:40,328 --> 00:47:42,238
Oh, sorry, didn't see you there!

704
00:47:42,696 --> 00:47:45,084
Are you in or out?
- I leave for Cairo in an hour.

705
00:47:45,115 --> 00:47:47,197
Will you stop by my friends' house?
- All right, Sunday!

706
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:49,068
Bon voyage!
- Did you get my stockings?

707
00:47:49,068 --> 00:47:51,154
Three pairs, gorgeous!
- No, leave them in the locker room for now.

708
00:47:51,154 --> 00:47:53,657
I'll pick it up when I get back from Saigon,
and we'll settle up then.

709
00:47:54,783 --> 00:47:56,455
Don't forget my friends!
- Okay!

710
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,356
Well, it's like the Merville market!

711
00:47:58,356 --> 00:48:01,874
By the way, how's your fountain pen, steward?
- Thanks for the reminder!

712
00:48:07,525 --> 00:48:08,807
Pierre!

713
00:48:11,031 --> 00:48:12,833
What happened to you, Pierre?

714
00:48:12,833 --> 00:48:14,970
You were supposed to call me three weeks ago
you should have called me.

715
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:16,568
I didn't mean to bore you.

716
00:48:16,568 --> 00:48:20,108
What's that strange thought?
- It's nothing special...

717
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:22,634
I called your house--
no answer.

718
00:48:22,634 --> 00:48:25,590
I'm sorry! But I don't think you missed me
missed me. - Not at all!

719
00:48:25,685 --> 00:48:27,218
Are you from New York?
- Uh, yeah.

720
00:48:28,144 --> 00:48:29,931
Good flight?
- It was great.

721
00:48:29,931 --> 00:48:31,354
When are we flying
to New York together?

722
00:48:31,354 --> 00:48:32,888
I'll be right there.
- All right!

723
00:48:32,888 --> 00:48:34,757
What are you doing tonight?
Why don't we have dinner together?

724
00:48:34,757 --> 00:48:36,559
Impossible.
I'm busy tonight.

725
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:39,256
Of course, I'm not at liberty to give you
advice, but you'd better go to bed.

726
00:48:39,256 --> 00:48:41,863
New York-Paris is exhausting!
- We'd have a quick dinner.....

727
00:48:41,863 --> 00:48:45,580
I'd love to....
Good luck!

728
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,951
And don't think too badly of me
too badly!

729
00:48:56,838 --> 00:48:58,277
Ah, there you are!

730
00:49:01,317 --> 00:49:02,878
Here's your goodies!

731
00:49:04,218 --> 00:49:07,731
Your nylons...
Your cigarettes. Here!

732
00:49:10,969 --> 00:49:12,752
My head is spinning!
- Why?

733
00:49:12,752 --> 00:49:14,967
Look at me,
how exhausted I am!

734
00:49:15,211 --> 00:49:18,107
I just met Aubrey, who
who said I look terrible.

735
00:49:18,107 --> 00:49:21,884
No surprise there! Do you know
how much I have this month?

736
00:49:25,222 --> 00:49:27,089
160 hours of flight time!
Can you believe it?

737
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:29,442
The day after tomorrow you're flying
Paris-Saigon!

738
00:49:30,065 --> 00:49:33,627
Is this a joke? No?
No, they're not getting this!

739
00:49:33,973 --> 00:49:35,958
Well, why can't I
fly to Dakar anymore?

740
00:49:35,958 --> 00:49:38,393
What's the good
about this Dakar?

741
00:49:38,393 --> 00:49:41,091
Sun and mosquitoes!
And you're complaining?!

742
00:49:41,287 --> 00:49:44,088
Aubrey told me he didn't understand
why we don't fly together anymore!

743
00:49:44,088 --> 00:49:46,266
Oh, really?
- Really what?

744
00:49:46,758 --> 00:49:49,479
Nothing... Uh, are you sure
that Aubrey told you that?

745
00:49:50,107 --> 00:49:52,037
Does that surprise you?
- More than surprised!

746
00:49:52,138 --> 00:49:54,364
Look at the flight schedule!

747
00:49:55,841 --> 00:49:58,209
See, when he flew to Fort-de-France
he flew to Fort-de-France,

748
00:49:58,209 --> 00:49:59,749
I put you on the flight.

749
00:49:59,749 --> 00:50:01,821
He asked me
for another stewardess.

750
00:50:02,286 --> 00:50:04,259
On what pretext?
- No reason.

751
00:50:05,672 --> 00:50:07,367
You could have told me!

752
00:50:07,367 --> 00:50:08,594
For what?

753
00:50:08,594 --> 00:50:10,288
So he asked you to, uh.

754
00:50:11,084 --> 00:50:13,334
So when you say
that he's sorry.

755
00:50:13,334 --> 00:50:14,713
let me smile!

756
00:50:19,868 --> 00:50:21,972
I don't see what Aubrey
that Aubrey could blame me for!

757
00:50:21,972 --> 00:50:25,212
And you don't hear what Forestier
Forestier could have told him?!

758
00:50:25,999 --> 00:50:27,974
You're blind and deaf!
Absolutely!

759
00:50:28,452 --> 00:50:30,965
I will demand that Jacques
to explain himself to Aubrey in front of me!

760
00:50:30,965 --> 00:50:34,645
You won't demand anything
from Jacques. It's too late!

761
00:50:34,925 --> 00:50:36,699
Because, uh. Aubrey's leaving.

762
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:38,725
What do you mean. "leaving"?

763
00:50:38,725 --> 00:50:40,549
Yes. Dakar-Rio is flying
for the last time!

764
00:50:40,549 --> 00:50:43,361
For the last time?
- Yeah. He's leaving for good.

765
00:50:43,361 --> 00:50:45,559
Asked for an assignment
to Indochina.

766
00:50:48,156 --> 00:50:49,804
Who's flying to Dakar tomorrow?

767
00:50:49,804 --> 00:50:51,598
No, it's impossible!
- Why not?

768
00:50:51,598 --> 00:50:53,144
Because Jacques!

769
00:50:53,144 --> 00:50:54,737
Ah, Forestier...

770
00:50:55,375 --> 00:50:58,049
Well, uh. if you would be so kind.
Sign me up!

771
00:50:58,049 --> 00:51:00,443
You're crazy!
- Sign me up.

772
00:51:01,383 --> 00:51:02,777
I thought you were tired...

773
00:51:11,957 --> 00:51:14,185
Good afternoon! - Flight
Bordeaux-Madrid-Casablanca,

774
00:51:14,185 --> 00:51:16,617
10,000 feet, alternate
Marrakech.

775
00:51:17,026 --> 00:51:19,104
Is the paperwork okay?
- It's in order.

776
00:51:19,324 --> 00:51:21,024
Good afternoon, commander!

777
00:51:21,024 --> 00:51:25,319
О... that feels so good!
That feels so damn good!

778
00:51:25,822 --> 00:51:27,691
Bring me the data
on the fuel! - All right. Uh-huh.

779
00:51:27,691 --> 00:51:29,202
Here's the passenger list.

780
00:51:29,202 --> 00:51:31,414
Did you know I was coming?
- Yes, commander.

781
00:51:32,993 --> 00:51:36,732
I'm so glad to be flying with you!
- I'm glad too, Commander.

782
00:51:36,732 --> 00:51:40,172
Stop calling me
Commander! - Yes, commander!

783
00:51:40,329 --> 00:51:41,730
I love you!

784
00:51:41,948 --> 00:51:43,551
If you call me
as my commanding officer,

785
00:51:43,551 --> 00:51:45,740
I'll give you one!
- All right, commander!

786
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,446
Hey, old man!
Are you leaving?

787
00:52:59,579 --> 00:53:01,981
Decided to meet us?
- Yeah, yeah.

788
00:53:01,981 --> 00:53:04,249
Are you okay?
- I'm fine, thanks!

789
00:53:04,308 --> 00:53:06,771
But it's true what they say,
that you're leaving us?

790
00:53:06,771 --> 00:53:08,594
Yeah, I got the transfer.

791
00:53:08,594 --> 00:53:11,427
A net loss for the company!
You could have at least warned your friends!

792
00:53:12,007 --> 00:53:14,634
Well, it was good to see you.
See you later, buddy!

793
00:53:22,244 --> 00:53:23,500
Pierre!

794
00:53:31,459 --> 00:53:32,826
Back on the road again?

795
00:53:32,863 --> 00:53:34,682
I'm here because of you.

796
00:53:34,682 --> 00:53:37,353
Why didn't you tell me
you were leaving Orly altogether?

797
00:53:37,353 --> 00:53:39,380
Well, uh. I have my own
my own little secrets.

798
00:53:39,705 --> 00:53:41,768
Are you interested in them?

799
00:53:42,081 --> 00:53:43,843
You wanted to say goodbye to me?

800
00:53:43,843 --> 00:53:46,166
Look, I've got
I have other things to do on board,

801
00:53:46,166 --> 00:53:48,464
but why don't we meet you
at the bar in half an hour?

802
00:53:48,464 --> 00:53:50,174
Well, uh. why not?!

803
00:54:35,274 --> 00:54:38,352
Got a razor, old man?
- Take it yourself!

804
00:54:38,352 --> 00:54:39,641
Thank you!

805
00:54:44,684 --> 00:54:46,940
Hey, you know what?
- What?

806
00:54:47,067 --> 00:54:49,233
Claire's room.
- So?

807
00:54:49,233 --> 00:54:51,517
Just because she's here,
next to yours.

808
00:54:51,517 --> 00:54:55,426
So?!
- Come on, come on.

809
00:54:56,096 --> 00:54:58,516
We'll die again
from the heat like the last time...

810
00:54:59,953 --> 00:55:02,932
Hello, Gilberte!
- Are you here to stay now?

811
00:55:03,047 --> 00:55:05,515
It's my pleasure to leave
my seat to you! What a hole.

812
00:55:05,515 --> 00:55:07,261
I couldn't sleep, it was so hot!

813
00:55:07,261 --> 00:55:08,743
Been outside half the night.

814
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:12,574
Okay, am I forgetting something?

815
00:55:13,022 --> 00:55:14,591
Ah, the most important thing!

816
00:55:15,863 --> 00:55:17,442
Goodbye!
- See you soon!

817
00:55:17,454 --> 00:55:19,790
I guess I'll see you the day after tomorrow
in Rio? - Anything can happen!

818
00:55:20,659 --> 00:55:24,812
Hey! Gilberte!
Your picture.

819
00:55:24,812 --> 00:55:27,520
Oh, I'm sorry!
It's my fiancé! You know.

820
00:55:34,734 --> 00:55:37,447
Do you have a soapbox?
- I used to. I lent it to Mulino.

821
00:55:37,447 --> 00:55:40,416
Hey, Mulino!
Give me back my Forestier soap!

822
00:55:40,416 --> 00:55:42,130
All right!
- I'll give it right back.

823
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:43,612
It's not on fire!

824
00:55:51,408 --> 00:55:53,470
Soap! Catch!
- Thank you!

825
00:55:54,929 --> 00:56:03,101
The sea! You can see it dancing.....

826
00:56:03,517 --> 00:56:08,823
Along the clear bays
in the silver reflection...

827
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:09,914
Shit!

828
00:56:10,491 --> 00:56:13,390
Hey, can somebody
lend me some soap?

829
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:14,825
Mine ran under the door.

830
00:56:15,181 --> 00:56:17,031
A bar of soap, please!

831
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,388
Thanks, buddy!

832
00:56:21,809 --> 00:56:23,380
Oh, it's you!

833
00:56:24,317 --> 00:56:27,204
In the pool of whiteness
of bathing flesh.

834
00:56:27,421 --> 00:56:29,739
I want to hold your hand
and give you back your soap...

835
00:56:29,739 --> 00:56:31,645
Would you like to stop
and let go of my hand?

836
00:56:31,735 --> 00:56:33,092
Say "you" to me!

837
00:56:33,092 --> 00:56:35,263
I am naked, you are naked.....
Say "you" to me!

838
00:56:35,667 --> 00:56:37,655
When naked people come together in a place like this.
they say, "you."

839
00:56:38,076 --> 00:56:39,888
You!
- You what?

840
00:56:39,888 --> 00:56:41,822
I'm sick of you!
Let go of my hand!

841
00:56:41,822 --> 00:56:43,863
Please!
Take your proud hand!

842
00:56:45,173 --> 00:56:48,699
Claire... How beautiful is your
unadorned beauty.

843
00:56:48,781 --> 00:56:51,016
a few meters away.

844
00:56:51,911 --> 00:56:55,269
Claire!
Claire, I represent you, uh.

845
00:56:56,929 --> 00:56:58,042
Claire!

846
00:56:59,022 --> 00:57:00,931
Your soap!
Here you go!

847
00:57:07,052 --> 00:57:08,189
Claire?

848
00:57:42,235 --> 00:57:44,124
The great battle
of the masters begins!

849
00:57:44,124 --> 00:57:45,643
The killer will fall into our hands.

850
00:57:45,643 --> 00:57:47,235
The poisonous creatures
scatter in terror,

851
00:57:47,235 --> 00:57:49,223
but they'll be our prisoners.

852
00:57:49,223 --> 00:57:50,712
And mosquitoes above all else!

853
00:57:54,355 --> 00:57:57,328
Please do not disturb anyone's sleep,
especially between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.

854
00:57:59,958 --> 00:58:01,252
Ah, there you are!

855
00:58:02,936 --> 00:58:04,930
A surprise visit like this
it's very kind.

856
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:10,289
Are you sulking?

857
00:58:10,906 --> 00:58:13,131
I'm not pouting at all.
On the contrary!

858
00:58:13,449 --> 00:58:15,541
I'm in a great
I'm in a great mood.

859
00:58:15,937 --> 00:58:19,434
Life is beautiful!
Life is extraordinarily good!

860
00:58:21,268 --> 00:58:22,724
What a miracle!

861
00:58:23,861 --> 00:58:27,078
My dear Jacques. I have
wonderful news for you.

862
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:29,327
You asked me
to say "you" to you--

863
00:58:29,327 --> 00:58:31,130
and I'm saying "you" to you.
for the last time!

864
00:58:31,548 --> 00:58:33,599
It's time for me to share with you
my joy.

865
00:58:34,406 --> 00:58:35,988
Jacques.
- Wait!

866
00:58:35,988 --> 00:58:38,796
When people say "you" to me,
it's for life!

867
00:58:38,796 --> 00:58:40,646
No!
Just for a week!

868
00:58:40,987 --> 00:58:44,294
Jacques... My baby Jacques!
I'm getting married!

869
00:58:44,294 --> 00:58:45,845
Married to Aubrey.

870
00:58:45,845 --> 00:58:47,070
Pierre is for friends.

871
00:58:48,002 --> 00:58:50,998
So, uh. I wanted to say
"you" to you good-bye!

872
00:58:52,579 --> 00:58:55,190
So, uh. congratulate me!

873
00:58:55,426 --> 00:58:57,060
There are ready-made formulas...

874
00:58:57,613 --> 00:58:58,854
Liar!

875
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:02,381
To think that Aubrey decided
to step aside just because

876
00:59:02,381 --> 00:59:05,698
that I imagined that you were still playing
some role in my life,

877
00:59:05,698 --> 00:59:08,644
that you so subtly
hinted at!

878
00:59:08,644 --> 00:59:11,938
Looks like you bragged to him
before you tried your luck with me.

879
00:59:11,938 --> 00:59:13,450
I didn't say those words!

880
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:16,122
It's not that you left me
me, that you have a claim on me.

881
00:59:16,122 --> 00:59:18,398
I took that flight
to look for Aubrey.

882
00:59:18,398 --> 00:59:22,429
If you have a sense of humor,
laugh at this situation!

883
00:59:22,429 --> 00:59:24,927
Can you believe it: you're the ones
you're the one who got me to Aubrey,

884
00:59:24,927 --> 00:59:26,763
it was you who served
as my coachman!

885
00:59:27,675 --> 00:59:29,954
Get out! - Tomorrow we're
we're meeting him in Rio.

886
00:59:29,954 --> 00:59:32,582
Who's taking me there?
You, Jacques Forestier!

887
00:59:33,074 --> 00:59:35,513
What? This is not what you
you were expecting from Dakar?!

888
00:59:35,513 --> 00:59:38,532
This flight was worth it, huh?!
- Get away from me!

889
01:00:40,689 --> 01:00:42,629
I'm sorry about that outburst!

890
01:00:42,629 --> 01:00:44,279
I acted like a scumbag.

891
01:00:44,468 --> 01:00:46,469
I couldn't help myself.

892
01:00:47,666 --> 01:00:49,551
Claire. Can we be friends?

893
01:00:50,756 --> 01:00:52,213
Leave me alone!

894
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:55,675
Friends?
- Okay, okay, uh. friends.

895
01:00:55,697 --> 01:00:57,480
And a little smile
to smooth things over?

896
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:59,790
Just one smile...

897
01:01:00,232 --> 01:01:01,389
It's settled!

898
01:01:04,506 --> 01:01:07,459
That's not true, is it?
Aubrey?

899
01:01:10,474 --> 01:01:11,699
That's not true!

900
01:01:13,917 --> 01:01:15,760
You're kidding.
You don't like Aubrey?

901
01:01:18,524 --> 01:01:20,611
Can you tell me
to my face that you love Aubrey?

902
01:01:22,145 --> 01:01:23,621
I love Aubrey.

903
01:01:25,243 --> 01:01:27,917
No-o-o-o.
- All right!

904
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:31,866
Aubrey's a nice guy, but there's nothing unusual about him.
there's nothing unusual about him.

905
01:01:32,141 --> 01:01:35,623
Life with him is like a game
of dominoes, always by the rules!

906
01:01:35,694 --> 01:01:37,862
No, no, I have a lot of respect for Aubrey....

907
01:01:37,862 --> 01:01:41,656
He's well-mannered, courageous. precise.
judicious and honest.

908
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:43,885
Capable...
hard-working.

909
01:01:43,885 --> 01:01:46,539
Discreet... educated.
well-mannered.

910
01:01:46,539 --> 01:01:48,293
But he looks like an umbrella!

911
01:01:48,609 --> 01:01:51,064
You're as ill-equipped
to live with an umbrella as I am...

912
01:01:51,064 --> 01:01:54,278
That must be a strange girl
who fits what you've made up!

913
01:01:54,278 --> 01:01:57,442
Virtuous!
Like a button on Aubrey's shoe!

914
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:00,263
Button!
- I want to live in peace!

915
01:02:01,115 --> 01:02:02,645
Living on a schedule?

916
01:02:03,395 --> 01:02:05,086
Typewritten?

917
01:02:05,086 --> 01:02:06,795
Without a single typo?

918
01:02:08,463 --> 01:02:10,166
Living without hope...

919
01:02:10,772 --> 01:02:12,427
This life is simple!

920
01:02:12,427 --> 01:02:16,308
You talk about hope--
I need security.

921
01:02:16,308 --> 01:02:19,105
Ah, here it is. there it is,
the cowardly word!

922
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:20,870
For you to get married

923
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:23,890
it means getting insurance
against robbery, fire.

924
01:02:23,890 --> 01:02:25,181
...and from love!

925
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:28,700
I have no ambition.

926
01:02:28,913 --> 01:02:30,906
Attachment
is enough for happiness.

927
01:02:32,857 --> 01:02:35,255
You don't believe my
Aubrey story?

928
01:02:36,105 --> 01:02:37,753
You don't believe it's true?

929
01:02:38,569 --> 01:02:40,826
How are all the stories without the tall tales?

930
01:02:40,826 --> 01:02:42,395
It's true, I swear to you!

931
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:50,200
You know, for three years now.
we've been living our own lives.

932
01:02:54,393 --> 01:02:55,786
You're going to laugh...

933
01:02:55,786 --> 01:02:57,230
but when you left.

934
01:02:57,230 --> 01:02:59,844
I experienced this
deceptive feeling,

935
01:02:59,844 --> 01:03:03,519
this meaningless feeling
you call love.

936
01:03:04,955 --> 01:03:06,993
Yeah, I wanted to kill myself
because of a guy.

937
01:03:06,993 --> 01:03:09,036
the guy that I
took seriously.

938
01:03:09,722 --> 01:03:13,137
but I haven't had much
experience in life or death....

939
01:03:13,137 --> 01:03:14,452
and it didn't work out!

940
01:03:14,736 --> 01:03:17,147
I was in the hospital
for three days, and, uh.

941
01:03:17,147 --> 01:03:19,483
and I realized
how ridiculous I am.

942
01:03:20,185 --> 01:03:22,765
There she is, Miss Gardenial!
It's me!

943
01:03:22,937 --> 01:03:26,222
If you knew who this ridiculous drama
all this ridiculous drama was for.

944
01:03:26,811 --> 01:03:28,358
No, let's be fair:

945
01:03:28,358 --> 01:03:31,761
love is more than
a trivial event!

946
01:03:31,993 --> 01:03:33,303
Good night!

947
01:03:34,779 --> 01:03:38,783
Anyway. if I hadn't
hadn't left you, you would've--

948
01:03:38,783 --> 01:03:40,512
Who knows?!

949
01:03:42,445 --> 01:03:44,321
You wouldn't have met
with this guy!

950
01:03:49,453 --> 01:03:51,300
Who was that?

951
01:03:51,474 --> 01:03:54,252
Well...a man of your kind!

952
01:03:59,247 --> 01:04:01,127
Why did you want
to kill yourself?

953
01:04:01,999 --> 01:04:03,746
What did he do to you?

954
01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:07,789
It's nothing! He just left me
all of a sudden.

955
01:04:08,105 --> 01:04:09,916
But I left you, too!

956
01:04:09,916 --> 01:04:11,699
And you survived it just fine!

957
01:04:12,422 --> 01:04:14,685
Of course. you didn't love me
you didn't love me!

958
01:04:14,943 --> 01:04:16,494
Three meetings...what do they mean!

959
01:04:16,494 --> 01:04:18,233
A simple whim!

960
01:04:18,233 --> 01:04:20,438
Please. don't
make a scene over something

961
01:04:20,438 --> 01:04:22,045
that I didn't kill myself
because of you!

962
01:04:28,632 --> 01:04:30,242
Did you, of course.
you went out with him afterward, of course?

963
01:04:30,309 --> 01:04:31,723
Oh, you bet, Jacques!

964
01:04:43,339 --> 01:04:45,048
You met him - and then?

965
01:04:45,369 --> 01:04:46,976
Then nothing.

966
01:04:47,773 --> 01:04:50,136
He wanted to start over
as if nothing had happened.

967
01:04:52,715 --> 01:04:54,608
And I'm paying for it now!
- Quiet.

968
01:04:55,388 --> 01:05:01,478
Yes... Yes, you're marrying Aubrey,
to get rid of him!

969
01:05:01,514 --> 01:05:02,799
Panic!

970
01:05:05,005 --> 01:05:07,736
You still love him,
it's obvious!

971
01:05:08,364 --> 01:05:12,863
Just understand, this marriage is
is a second suicide!

972
01:05:12,863 --> 01:05:15,233
Suicide,
stretched out over time!

973
01:05:15,888 --> 01:05:17,415
Delayed suicide!

974
01:05:17,706 --> 01:05:19,568
I'll be happy with Aubrey!

975
01:05:19,724 --> 01:05:21,016
Claire!

976
01:05:21,016 --> 01:05:22,936
Now I know who
you really are.

977
01:05:23,650 --> 01:05:26,626
We met too soon,
we didn't know how to live seriously.

978
01:05:26,626 --> 01:05:29,648
If we thought about us,
I'm sure we would love...

979
01:05:29,648 --> 01:05:31,386
each other for real
until now!

980
01:05:31,386 --> 01:05:33,992
It was all it took--
just a moment's attention.

981
01:05:34,636 --> 01:05:37,073
I love you.
- No, no, you don't love me!

982
01:05:38,036 --> 01:05:39,879
It's just a regret...

983
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,444
It's like when we
think of the dead.

984
01:05:42,721 --> 01:05:45,115
"If I had known, I would have been
I would have been more attentive to her."

985
01:05:45,987 --> 01:05:48,542
And it's not:
you wouldn't be any different!

986
01:05:48,927 --> 01:05:50,477
Don't think about me anymore!

987
01:05:50,785 --> 01:05:52,813
Don't think, because
it's not worth it!

988
01:05:53,579 --> 01:05:55,188
You're mistaking
you're mistaking yourself for someone else.

989
01:05:55,188 --> 01:05:57,393
I loved someone else,
not you, you fool!

990
01:05:57,846 --> 01:06:00,634
Claire.
- No, Jacques, no!

991
01:06:02,421 --> 01:06:04,277
Will you two stop yapping in there?!

992
01:06:04,891 --> 01:06:07,477
I forgot to close the window.
- Never, Jacques, never again!

993
01:06:07,593 --> 01:06:10,042
Hey, you're keeping people awake!

994
01:06:11,216 --> 01:06:14,994
Stop yelling! Shut up!
- All right, all right. All right.

995
01:06:15,544 --> 01:06:17,426
Are you happy now?!

996
01:06:29,089 --> 01:06:30,469
Control tower?

997
01:06:30,894 --> 01:06:34,050
Air France - BBDK.

998
01:06:34,637 --> 01:06:36,720
We're at 3,000 feet,

999
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:39,623
five minutes north
of the landing site.

1000
01:06:39,623 --> 01:06:41,038
Come in!

1001
01:06:41,951 --> 01:06:44,105
Let the passengers know
that we're approaching Rio!

1002
01:07:03,957 --> 01:07:05,719
See you tomorrow!
- Bye, bye!

1003
01:07:07,924 --> 01:07:10,606
So you sure you're not coming
to the La Playa Hotel with us?

1004
01:07:10,606 --> 01:07:13,502
No, Jacques, I told you,
I'm expected at the Rio Branco.

1005
01:07:13,502 --> 01:07:15,766
I didn't lie to you.
- But, uh, I thought maybe, uh.

1006
01:07:15,766 --> 01:07:19,557
What is it? - No, nothing.
You made your choice.

1007
01:07:24,995 --> 01:07:26,850
Bye, see you tomorrow!
- Bye! Bye!

1008
01:07:27,024 --> 01:07:28,183
Wait a minute!

1009
01:07:44,366 --> 01:07:46,026
I'm booked!

1010
01:07:46,026 --> 01:07:47,682
Mademoiselle Mani?
- Yes. I have one!

1011
01:07:49,339 --> 01:07:51,052
Z08, mademoiselle!
- All right.

1012
01:07:51,052 --> 01:07:52,499
They're waiting for you at the bar.

1013
01:07:55,151 --> 01:07:56,591
Did you win?

1014
01:07:58,455 --> 01:07:59,923
How long have you been here?

1015
01:07:59,923 --> 01:08:01,869
Just arrived. And imagined
something like this!

1016
01:08:02,241 --> 01:08:03,293
Take it away!

1017
01:08:04,995 --> 01:08:06,217
Greetings!

1018
01:08:07,257 --> 01:08:10,365
I can't believe my eyes.
You're here!

1019
01:08:10,729 --> 01:08:12,062
Does that surprise you?

1020
01:08:12,563 --> 01:08:14,357
Go away, you liars!

1021
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:18,676
I just wish you guys
to never regret it!

1022
01:08:19,579 --> 01:08:20,981
You know, uh.

1023
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:23,469
I've already told you that
there's nothing unusual about me.

1024
01:08:23,469 --> 01:08:25,311
nothing dazzling...

1025
01:08:26,213 --> 01:08:28,495
But you can count on me,
I always keep my word.

1026
01:08:28,495 --> 01:08:30,309
I'll make you happy.

1027
01:08:30,769 --> 01:08:32,142
I believe you!

1028
01:08:33,819 --> 01:08:35,705
Did you explain yourself to Forestier?

1029
01:08:36,367 --> 01:08:39,261
He was forced to admit
that he had no rights to me.

1030
01:08:39,261 --> 01:08:41,121
He even apologized
to me.

1031
01:08:43,734 --> 01:08:45,248
It just touched me!

1032
01:08:46,132 --> 01:08:48,450
He can't hold a grudge against you.

1033
01:08:49,382 --> 01:08:50,892
I envy myself...

1034
01:08:51,427 --> 01:08:53,682
Imagine, I hardly know
I know almost nothing about you!

1035
01:08:54,404 --> 01:08:55,932
But I'll learn you by heart!

1036
01:08:57,150 --> 01:09:01,136
You'll find that with each passing day.
I'll know you better and better...

1037
01:09:02,346 --> 01:09:05,166
Well, I'm going to teach you right away
something very entertaining.

1038
01:09:06,466 --> 01:09:07,810
I'm very hungry!

1039
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:09,626
How convenient: I know a great restaurant
a great restaurant!

1040
01:09:09,626 --> 01:09:11,407
Just a moment,
I'll take off my uniform!

1041
01:09:13,683 --> 01:09:15,011
Hurry up!

1042
01:09:18,649 --> 01:09:19,975
Do it again!

1043
01:09:19,975 --> 01:09:23,621
I love Rio! It's the most beautiful
city in the world! In the last 5 minutes!

1044
01:09:34,888 --> 01:09:36,565
I really love the left bank.....

1045
01:09:36,565 --> 01:09:40,289
Bonaparte Street ... Street of the Holy
the fathers. Tournon Street...

1046
01:09:40,289 --> 01:09:42,804
Neya's restaurant in the winter...

1047
01:09:42,804 --> 01:09:45,097
And starting in May.
we'll be living in Virofl.

1048
01:09:46,495 --> 01:09:48,233
I have a beautiful property.

1049
01:09:49,067 --> 01:09:51,326
For radishes alone.
I get up to 300 francs.

1050
01:10:00,318 --> 01:10:02,077
My mother manages
the household.

1051
01:10:02,846 --> 01:10:04,675
You'll get along fine with her.

1052
01:10:04,729 --> 01:10:06,206
I'm sure you do.

1053
01:10:24,528 --> 01:10:25,891
Shall we dance?

1054
01:10:42,998 --> 01:10:46,616
Please! Sit down!
- Ooh-la-la, yes, yes.

1055
01:10:46,764 --> 01:10:49,817
Did you hear that? Bottle
"ooh-la-la-la, da-da!"

1056
01:10:49,817 --> 01:10:51,194
Yes, that one!

1057
01:10:51,194 --> 01:10:52,945
I'm calm in my cubicle,

1058
01:10:52,945 --> 01:10:56,152
I'm my own boss.
I don't depend on anyone.

1059
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:59,142
My crew is myself.

1060
01:11:00,667 --> 01:11:03,138
And what roads brought you
to Orly?

1061
01:11:03,138 --> 01:11:04,869
Oh, it's the other way around for me!

1062
01:11:04,869 --> 01:11:06,661
I need a panorama.

1063
01:11:06,661 --> 01:11:09,213
I love change...
new faces.

1064
01:11:10,142 --> 01:11:12,247
People in the air are different
are not the same as on the ground.

1065
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:14,260
What about you? What will you drink?
- What are you drinking?

1066
01:11:14,260 --> 01:11:15,748
Uh...
- Yes!

1067
01:11:15,832 --> 01:11:17,860
"Yes, yes..."
You don't understand anything!

1068
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:19,726
Other women, too.
women, too.

1069
01:11:19,726 --> 01:11:21,924
They're all foreigners.
I love you!

1070
01:11:21,924 --> 01:11:23,224
Ooh-la-la-la!

1071
01:11:24,054 --> 01:11:27,072
"Yes" and "la" are all words,
you know in French?

1072
01:11:27,089 --> 01:11:28,446
You're a cutie!

1073
01:11:28,669 --> 01:11:30,969
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm a cutie!

1074
01:11:30,969 --> 01:11:33,164
Well, that's it:
it's all been said!

1075
01:11:33,345 --> 01:11:34,810
You'll let me, won't you?

1076
01:11:34,805 --> 01:11:37,906
All women carry
the same thing in their purses.

1077
01:11:37,906 --> 01:11:39,840
In my heart, though, too.

1078
01:11:39,926 --> 01:11:42,476
A pack of cigarettes, a notebook
notebook, handkerchief.

1079
01:11:42,876 --> 01:11:45,916
Mascara!
Lighter!

1080
01:11:46,745 --> 01:11:49,390
О! Do you have a revolver?

1081
01:11:50,206 --> 01:11:52,285
Souvenir? Love? No?

1082
01:11:52,716 --> 01:11:54,812
How much?
- 2,000!

1083
01:11:55,779 --> 01:11:59,015
Ha, the word "how many"
you get it right away!

1084
01:11:59,115 --> 01:12:01,068
You're a real woman!

1085
01:12:01,315 --> 01:12:04,394
Revolver. How much?
2,000! That's great!

1086
01:12:04,394 --> 01:12:06,232
All right, all right!
I drink and to life.

1087
01:12:06,232 --> 01:12:08,489
and death and everything,
that follows!

1088
01:12:09,352 --> 01:12:11,835
To the soul - and to oblivion!

1089
01:12:16,215 --> 01:12:17,774
Let's dance!

1090
01:12:17,774 --> 01:12:20,848
Let's dance. It's
it's also a way to talk!

1091
01:12:21,382 --> 01:12:23,838
Would you like to go back
to the table? - Yes, I'd love to.

1092
01:12:37,124 --> 01:12:39,108
We can leave.
- If you want.

1093
01:12:39,981 --> 01:12:41,552
Maitre d', the check!

1094
01:12:42,607 --> 01:12:46,458
О... what a meeting!

1095
01:12:46,919 --> 01:12:49,283
What, you think you're Robinson
you're Robinson?

1096
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:51,483
Hey, Aubrey!

1097
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:53,139
Good evening, Claire!

1098
01:12:53,139 --> 01:12:56,803
First of all, no
no misunderstandings or ambiguities!

1099
01:12:57,247 --> 01:13:00,607
Aubrey. as I promised
Mademoiselle.

1100
01:13:01,065 --> 01:13:03,301
I do solemnly swear
on this spot.

1101
01:13:03,301 --> 01:13:06,604
that there's nothing between me and Claire
there's nothing. Not even a little bit!

1102
01:13:07,101 --> 01:13:08,435
Just memories!

1103
01:13:08,813 --> 01:13:10,001
Friends?

1104
01:13:10,369 --> 01:13:12,685
No, no, let me!

1105
01:13:12,685 --> 01:13:14,811
It's for me!

1106
01:13:15,191 --> 01:13:17,201
Bring us
a pair for her!

1107
01:13:17,201 --> 01:13:18,824
I'm sorry, but Claire is tired.

1108
01:13:19,385 --> 01:13:20,852
You'd better go to bed.

1109
01:13:20,852 --> 01:13:24,420
I'll go, don't worry!
That's why Madame is here.

1110
01:13:25,572 --> 01:13:26,837
What is it?

1111
01:13:27,217 --> 01:13:30,554
You don't look
very cheerful, my children!

1112
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:33,503
Oh, there's the girlfriend!

1113
01:13:33,813 --> 01:13:35,897
Thank you, buddy, thank you!

1114
01:13:36,936 --> 01:13:39,891
Some crave security...

1115
01:13:39,891 --> 01:13:41,749
Isn't that right, dear Claire?

1116
01:13:41,749 --> 01:13:44,638
Others crave madness.

1117
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:48,732
Cabbies like me.
Isn't that right, dear Claire?

1118
01:13:48,954 --> 01:13:50,470
Shall we have a toast?

1119
01:13:50,786 --> 01:13:53,020
Ah, yes! I present
my fiancée.

1120
01:13:53,589 --> 01:13:55,534
This is the perfect woman!

1121
01:13:55,534 --> 01:13:57,328
Doesn't know anything
except the word "how much."

1122
01:13:58,182 --> 01:13:59,464
And you don't need more than that!

1123
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:01,074
She's beautiful, isn't she?

1124
01:14:01,558 --> 01:14:02,964
Is she beautiful, my fiancée?

1125
01:14:02,964 --> 01:14:05,426
Good wives don't stay
more than one night.

1126
01:14:07,494 --> 01:14:11,264
Hey, hey? What's the matter with you two
with both of you?

1127
01:14:11,264 --> 01:14:13,194
You look like
both widowed!

1128
01:14:13,756 --> 01:14:15,497
You really are
pathetic.

1129
01:14:15,497 --> 01:14:18,374
Are you too well-mannered
to punch me in the face in public?

1130
01:14:18,374 --> 01:14:21,348
And for nothing! I'm so bored
here without entertainment!

1131
01:14:21,348 --> 01:14:24,454
No, Pierre!
He's not worth it.

1132
01:14:25,626 --> 01:14:28,640
Ah, I'm not worth it.
I'm not worth it!

1133
01:14:29,968 --> 01:14:31,516
Then I'm worthless,

1134
01:14:31,516 --> 01:14:33,814
and she thinks her love
for Aubrey is worth anything?!

1135
01:14:34,286 --> 01:14:36,818
She's driven by her love for Aubrey!

1136
01:14:37,785 --> 01:14:39,139
Goodbye, Claire!

1137
01:14:39,861 --> 01:14:41,349
Goodbye, Claire!

1138
01:14:44,304 --> 01:14:45,610
You disgust me!

1139
01:14:45,758 --> 01:14:49,682
Yeah. It's pretty
disgusting.

1140
01:14:50,741 --> 01:14:52,943
This is my way
to say good-bye to you.

1141
01:14:52,943 --> 01:14:54,816
I don't want you
to have any regrets.

1142
01:14:55,810 --> 01:14:58,496
Because I have a feeling
I'm never gonna see you again.

1143
01:14:59,947 --> 01:15:01,507
My life is over...

1144
01:15:01,507 --> 01:15:04,163
along with the bachelorhood
life, my little Claire.

1145
01:15:05,890 --> 01:15:08,826
Tomorrow morning, you'll understand
what I wanted to say today.

1146
01:15:09,214 --> 01:15:11,370
No explanatory notes!

1147
01:15:12,716 --> 01:15:15,725
И... be happy!

1148
01:15:17,278 --> 01:15:19,026
Between you and me,

1149
01:15:19,026 --> 01:15:23,172
happiness is an illusion,
that we give ourselves.

1150
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:29,718
Bye. Claire Aubrey!

1151
01:15:40,171 --> 01:15:41,713
Goodbye, Claire...

1152
01:15:42,737 --> 01:15:43,789
Goodbye!

1153
01:15:47,267 --> 01:15:49,536
363-й.
- Thank you.

1154
01:15:49,614 --> 01:15:51,309
Please wake me up
at half past five!

1155
01:15:51,988 --> 01:15:53,442
I don't have long to sleep...

1156
01:15:54,429 --> 01:15:56,264
So, Thursday at Dakar?

1157
01:15:56,264 --> 01:15:58,338
Yes, Thursday in Dakar.
- Remember me!

1158
01:15:58,338 --> 01:15:59,984
I don't forget.
Good night!

1159
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:02,626
Good night!

1160
01:16:03,631 --> 01:16:06,702
Your key!
- Oh, thank you!

1161
01:16:07,194 --> 01:16:09,405
Thursday at Dakar!
- Sure...

1162
01:16:33,419 --> 01:16:36,429
Hello? Hotel
"La Playa, please!

1163
01:16:42,818 --> 01:16:44,416
Hello, Hotel La Playa?

1164
01:16:44,772 --> 01:16:46,658
Is Mr. Forestier in?

1165
01:16:46,858 --> 01:16:48,408
Foo-rah-ho-ho-ho-ho!

1166
01:16:49,773 --> 01:16:51,296
Thank you.

1167
01:16:54,761 --> 01:16:56,215
So he's back?

1168
01:16:56,215 --> 01:16:57,619
Can you put him through
to his number?

1169
01:17:02,425 --> 01:17:03,556
Yes?

1170
01:17:04,335 --> 01:17:05,674
No answer?

1171
01:17:06,771 --> 01:17:08,340
Can you call me back?

1172
01:17:09,410 --> 01:17:11,246
Do it again!

1173
01:17:13,138 --> 01:17:14,694
Call again!

1174
01:17:22,628 --> 01:17:23,921
Uh, hello?

1175
01:17:25,954 --> 01:17:28,840
I'm sorry. But, uh.

1176
01:17:29,434 --> 01:17:31,454
Yeah, he's probably asleep by now.

1177
01:17:33,173 --> 01:17:34,691
Thank you.

1178
01:17:47,844 --> 01:17:49,111
Please...

1179
01:17:49,111 --> 01:17:51,763
Tell Mr. Forestier that Mademoiselle Manny
Mademoiselle Mani is asking for him.

1180
01:17:55,543 --> 01:17:57,225
That it's very important!

1181
01:17:57,967 --> 01:17:59,407
Hello? Hello?

1182
01:18:00,116 --> 01:18:01,737
Strange... The phone's been answered,
but no answer.

1183
01:18:01,737 --> 01:18:03,565
Hello? Hello?

1184
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,878
Nothing...
- Call again!

1185
01:18:05,993 --> 01:18:07,699
I'm sorry, call back again!

1186
01:18:08,866 --> 01:18:10,766
No, he picked up the phone,
but he won't talk.

1187
01:18:11,524 --> 01:18:12,809
Thank you.

1188
01:18:31,437 --> 01:18:32,801
This is Forestier's room,
señorita.

1189
01:18:32,801 --> 01:18:34,393
Please open the door!

1190
01:18:34,393 --> 01:18:35,959
Mr. Forestier doesn't answer.

1191
01:18:36,512 --> 01:18:37,987
I'm sure he's not well.

1192
01:18:37,987 --> 01:18:40,485
Sick!
Mr. Forestier!

1193
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:01,670
You came to make sure?

1194
01:19:01,961 --> 01:19:03,292
Not yet!

1195
01:19:05,275 --> 01:19:06,639
It's too soon!

1196
01:19:09,731 --> 01:19:11,163
Leave us alone!

1197
01:19:26,917 --> 01:19:28,219
You can have him!

1198
01:19:28,219 --> 01:19:30,420
I don't have to kill myself
to kill myself if you're here!

1199
01:19:31,110 --> 01:19:32,364
You're here...

1200
01:19:33,130 --> 01:19:35,777
Because you love me.
- I just didn't want to be guilty.

1201
01:19:35,777 --> 01:19:37,649
Otherwise. what do I have to worry about?

1202
01:19:38,157 --> 01:19:40,767
When a man wants to kill himself
he doesn't brag about it.

1203
01:19:40,767 --> 01:19:44,306
Oh. I forgot.
You're the expert!

1204
01:19:46,479 --> 01:19:48,521
What about Aubrey?

1205
01:19:48,521 --> 01:19:52,223
Good Aubrey! Sweet Aubrey!
How could he let you--

1206
01:19:52,223 --> 01:19:55,513
all alone, in the middle of the night.
to go to some monsieur's house?

1207
01:19:56,457 --> 01:19:59,617
He must be very
worried, poor Aubrey?

1208
01:20:00,593 --> 01:20:02,045
We have to calm him down!

1209
01:20:02,762 --> 01:20:04,380
We'll tell him that
it's okay.

1210
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:06,407
and he can revisit
an interrupted nap.

1211
01:20:06,407 --> 01:20:09,020
Hello?
Hello...

1212
01:20:09,351 --> 01:20:12,691
Watch out! If you call
Pierre, I won't hesitate.

1213
01:20:12,691 --> 01:20:15,057
Well, well, well, Mani.
what are you waiting for?

1214
01:20:15,374 --> 01:20:16,767
Hello?
- Jacques!

1215
01:20:16,767 --> 01:20:20,557
Hello? Would you mind
bring me two whiskeys?

1216
01:20:22,751 --> 01:20:23,989
No!

1217
01:20:25,065 --> 01:20:26,279
No!

1218
01:20:26,737 --> 01:20:28,733
Just a little while longer!

1219
01:20:30,277 --> 01:20:32,769
How could I have believed that
it was over between us?

1220
01:20:33,455 --> 01:20:36,234
That's ridiculous!
- Of course it is!

1221
01:20:36,234 --> 01:20:39,274
How could I have lived
for three years without Jacques Forestier?!

1222
01:20:39,274 --> 01:20:40,817
It's unimaginable!

1223
01:20:40,817 --> 01:20:42,389
And when he left me,

1224
01:20:42,389 --> 01:20:45,137
why didn't I tear my hair out
and screaming in public?

1225
01:20:45,723 --> 01:20:47,786
Why didn't I scream in pain?!

1226
01:20:47,786 --> 01:20:49,626
Why didn't you go crazy?

1227
01:20:49,626 --> 01:20:51,509
Why didn't you throw yourself into the Seine?

1228
01:20:51,509 --> 01:20:54,528
I could have made a big fuss,
instead of writing you farewell letters...

1229
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:56,138
so that I don't overshadow
your life!

1230
01:20:56,484 --> 01:20:58,608
Silent suicide...
on tiptoe!

1231
01:21:06,494 --> 01:21:07,760
Claire...

1232
01:21:09,283 --> 01:21:11,534
Yeah, you're the reason
I wanted to die.

1233
01:21:11,534 --> 01:21:13,406
A common thought...

1234
01:21:13,835 --> 01:21:15,630
A little girl's thought...

1235
01:21:18,228 --> 01:21:20,623
We've been at odds
we didn't understand each other.

1236
01:21:20,623 --> 01:21:24,404
You were my first love,
and I was your casual girlfriend.

1237
01:21:24,404 --> 01:21:26,440
Oh, no!
- Yeah, yeah, remember.

1238
01:21:26,661 --> 01:21:28,761
I thought it was
for life.

1239
01:21:29,613 --> 01:21:31,369
Did you know that
just for a week!

1240
01:21:31,572 --> 01:21:33,735
I was making plans while you were
packing your bags.

1241
01:21:34,084 --> 01:21:35,805
Just a misunderstanding...

1242
01:21:37,594 --> 01:21:40,534
I don't blame you: after all,
you didn't promise me anything.

1243
01:21:41,463 --> 01:21:43,874
Another woman...
Does that count?

1244
01:21:44,764 --> 01:21:48,269
Maybe I meant a little
more. in retrospect.

1245
01:21:49,916 --> 01:21:51,593
We both had to suffer.

1246
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:54,590
But now we're even!

1247
01:21:55,482 --> 01:21:58,063
If I said it now,
then there's nothing else I can do.

1248
01:21:58,063 --> 01:21:59,210
Nothing at all!

1249
01:21:59,210 --> 01:22:01,385
We're both totally smashed!

1250
01:22:01,385 --> 01:22:02,572
Claire!

1251
01:22:02,572 --> 01:22:04,770
It takes a miracle.
And there are no miracles!

1252
01:22:05,141 --> 01:22:07,520
I'm gonna make Aubrey happy.
regardless of us!

1253
01:22:07,869 --> 01:22:09,723
There's got to be
somebody's lucky!

1254
01:22:10,862 --> 01:22:14,213
It's gonna work out, buddy.
It'll all work out!

1255
01:22:15,530 --> 01:22:18,389
Here's, uh. the last memory
of our love.

1256
01:22:18,389 --> 01:22:20,405
and the final proof
of my trust!

1257
01:22:24,142 --> 01:22:26,190
No! No, it's over!

1258
01:23:13,660 --> 01:23:15,189
The decorations are ready!

1259
01:23:15,387 --> 01:23:18,357
Yeah. But they're kind of dirty.

1260
01:23:18,470 --> 01:23:20,628
It's a little early to be thinking
about a black coat.

1261
01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:41,498
Hey, put that one away!

1262
01:23:41,559 --> 01:23:43,386
I bet you can't do that kind of piggery
at home!

1263
01:23:43,386 --> 01:23:45,778
Then don't sit there in your socks!

1264
01:23:45,778 --> 01:23:47,655
My feet swell at altitude.

1265
01:23:47,726 --> 01:23:49,394
Crossing the equator soon?

1266
01:23:49,394 --> 01:23:52,015
Yes, but don't start the baptism until we've crossed
we cross those dark clouds!

1267
01:23:52,015 --> 01:23:53,509
There may be some chatter.

1268
01:23:53,597 --> 01:23:55,498
Will you be participating
in the baptism, commander?

1269
01:23:55,498 --> 01:23:57,394
If there's time, of course.

1270
01:24:03,967 --> 01:24:08,001
Please come forward for those of you who have
who have never crossed the equator!

1271
01:24:08,618 --> 01:24:11,747
For these people, we will prepare
baptismal certificates.

1272
01:24:11,747 --> 01:24:14,964
We'll be presenting them during
the traditional ceremony,

1273
01:24:14,964 --> 01:24:18,450
as soon as we cross
the storm front.

1274
01:24:21,610 --> 01:24:24,324
Whoever signs up first,
is the first to get it.

1275
01:24:24,324 --> 01:24:25,711
I don't get it!

1276
01:24:25,711 --> 01:24:29,401
We're issuing certificates
of baptism! - Ah, thank you.

1277
01:24:29,401 --> 01:24:32,141
Now, who has no certificate?
- Me, mademoiselle!

1278
01:24:33,627 --> 01:24:35,195
Я! Me, mademoiselle.

1279
01:24:35,195 --> 01:24:36,531
Me, mademoiselle!

1280
01:24:37,564 --> 01:24:39,073
For me, mademoiselle!

1281
01:24:48,471 --> 01:24:51,519
Turn on the ultraviolet!
Sometimes you can't see anything!

1282
01:25:23,230 --> 01:25:25,914
Looks like we made it.
- Yeah.

1283
01:25:37,830 --> 01:25:40,760
Yeah, we can see that:
4-meter waves...

1284
01:25:40,987 --> 01:25:42,653
I wouldn't want to go
to go to sea right now!

1285
01:25:42,981 --> 01:25:44,997
Don't drift, we've got
3,000 feet high!

1286
01:25:44,997 --> 01:25:47,611
I'm gonna come over and grab
something. I'll be quick!

1287
01:25:59,372 --> 01:26:03,849
Baptized in the name of a citizen
of the equatorial territories.

1288
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:11,188
We are Neptune,
god of the sea and sky,

1289
01:26:11,188 --> 01:26:13,307
we welcome you
into our kingdom.

1290
01:26:13,307 --> 01:26:15,435
and by our divine
by our baptism we pronounce you.

1291
01:26:15,435 --> 01:26:18,005
a citizen
of the equatorial territories!

1292
01:26:22,621 --> 01:26:25,563
We are Neptune,
god of the sea and sky,

1293
01:26:25,961 --> 01:26:27,721
we welcome you
into our kingdom.

1294
01:26:39,358 --> 01:26:40,816
What's the matter?
- What's that sound?!

1295
01:26:40,816 --> 01:26:42,866
Is it serious, commander?
- No, it's nothing!

1296
01:26:42,866 --> 01:26:44,111
Nothing!

1297
01:26:44,111 --> 01:26:45,926
I'm counting on you:
nothing serious!

1298
01:26:47,092 --> 01:26:49,530
Which engine?
- Engine one! Overload!

1299
01:26:49,530 --> 01:26:50,863
I've lowered the revs!

1300
01:26:53,818 --> 01:26:56,104
I've disabled the automatics.
- All right! Flux!

1301
01:26:58,352 --> 01:26:59,742
It's not coming!

1302
01:26:59,742 --> 01:27:02,587
Fluctuate, damn it!
damn it! - It's not working!

1303
01:27:02,587 --> 01:27:04,599
Try again!
Slow down!

1304
01:27:06,690 --> 01:27:08,529
Am I sending an SOS?
- No, wait!

1305
01:27:08,529 --> 01:27:10,419
Just a warning!
Not an SOS!

1306
01:27:10,551 --> 01:27:12,139
The plane is on fire!

1307
01:27:12,192 --> 01:27:15,349
Fire extinguisher on 1!
- Fire extinguisher on one.

1308
01:27:15,567 --> 01:27:18,314
Flaps-15!
- Got flaps-15!

1309
01:27:22,830 --> 01:27:25,135
Reduce speed!
No. 1 is not jammed.

1310
01:27:25,276 --> 01:27:26,680
We're only at 145 knots!

1311
01:27:38,225 --> 01:27:39,767
The 1st is still sparking!

1312
01:27:39,872 --> 01:27:42,318
Any smoke?
- No, no smoke!

1313
01:27:42,610 --> 01:27:44,922
Give me our coordinates!
- Here!

1314
01:27:45,414 --> 01:27:46,944
Is it serious?
- Yes! Yes, it is!

1315
01:27:46,945 --> 01:27:48,850
If the screw doesn't stop,
it's gonna cut us into slices.

1316
01:27:48,970 --> 01:27:50,436
The 1st is on fire again!

1317
01:27:51,050 --> 01:27:53,362
Turning on the fire extinguisher?
- No! Wait!

1318
01:27:53,497 --> 01:27:55,701
The revs are down!
Keep it that way for now!

1319
01:27:55,701 --> 01:27:59,188
Watch the plane!
What's the contour?

1320
01:27:59,583 --> 01:28:02,109
About 8! - Should I turn on
fire extinguisher? - No!

1321
01:28:04,572 --> 01:28:07,290
Don't worry, everything's fine!
It's just a minor malfunction.

1322
01:28:07,290 --> 01:28:09,152
No, you're just trying
to make us feel better!

1323
01:28:09,152 --> 01:28:13,536
No, no, no! So, uh,
whose turn is it to be baptized?

1324
01:28:28,606 --> 01:28:31,136
We can still save the plane!
- Should I turn on the fire extinguisher?

1325
01:28:31,136 --> 01:28:32,758
Give me a second grade!

1326
01:28:33,092 --> 01:28:35,047
Send an SOS!
- Got it!

1327
01:28:35,898 --> 01:28:39,321
Paul, turn that sound off:
it's hurting my ears! - Okay!

1328
01:28:40,606 --> 01:28:42,592
Mulino, find me
some iron!

1329
01:28:47,048 --> 01:28:49,066
Turns to 30
and take off the flaps!

1330
01:28:49,967 --> 01:28:51,308
Turns 30!

1331
01:28:53,857 --> 01:28:54,965
Flaps retracted.

1332
01:28:59,935 --> 01:29:01,517
There's a freighter
15 degrees to the left!

1333
01:29:01,936 --> 01:29:04,404
Call them, have them give us
their coordinates! - Yes, sir!

1334
01:29:04,615 --> 01:29:08,115
Delois! Look at the 1st
screw and what's wrong with the plane!

1335
01:29:09,079 --> 01:29:10,485
The screw is breaking off!

1336
01:29:11,513 --> 01:29:13,326
Wouldn't cut us in half!

1337
01:29:13,523 --> 01:29:14,983
This shake is no better!

1338
01:29:14,950 --> 01:29:16,140
Put your seat belts on!

1339
01:29:18,137 --> 01:29:20,012
Fasten your
seat belts!

1340
01:29:20,048 --> 01:29:22,931
Monsieur, please be
be sensible, set an example!

1341
01:29:22,950 --> 01:29:25,574
Madam! - You're the ones
you're used to it, not us!

1342
01:29:25,574 --> 01:29:27,564
I'd like to see you
if you were us!

1343
01:29:27,564 --> 01:29:29,094
We are all mortal, madam!

1344
01:29:29,094 --> 01:29:30,807
Well, we don't have to die now!

1345
01:29:30,926 --> 01:29:33,520
Oh, Monsieur le curé! Monsieur le curé!
- Please, madame.

1346
01:29:33,585 --> 01:29:35,612
God is with us,
we risk nothing.

1347
01:29:35,645 --> 01:29:38,423
Stay in your seats
and fasten your seat belts!

1348
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:42,710
Did they get the SOS and
our coordinates? - Yes, they did.

1349
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:45,487
And the passengers? What can I tell them?
I can't hold them any longer!

1350
01:29:45,487 --> 01:29:47,937
Clear the last three rows:
our tail is too heavy.

1351
01:29:48,927 --> 01:29:50,408
The screw's about to come off!

1352
01:29:52,118 --> 01:29:54,498
That's right!
It's gone!

1353
01:29:57,529 --> 01:29:59,851
Ladies and gentlemen, I just
just got off the phone with the commander.

1354
01:29:59,851 --> 01:30:02,911
If you do exactly
as you're told, you'll be fine.

1355
01:30:03,281 --> 01:30:05,395
You'll undoubtedly
will feel a jolt.

1356
01:30:05,395 --> 01:30:07,751
A little jolt,
don't worry!

1357
01:30:11,219 --> 01:30:13,238
Mademoiselle!
Mademoiselle.

1358
01:30:13,611 --> 01:30:14,945
It's not a big deal!

1359
01:30:15,713 --> 01:30:17,944
Fire's spreading to 2nd!
- Stop 2nd!

1360
01:30:18,968 --> 01:30:21,748
Fluxing!
- Flugging 2nd!

1361
01:30:22,183 --> 01:30:24,859
Hurry, hurry, Borda!
SOS and coordinates!

1362
01:30:25,103 --> 01:30:27,554
Fire on 2nd!
- Fire extinguisher on 2nd!

1363
01:30:27,664 --> 01:30:29,718
More traction on the right!
I can't hold it anymore!

1364
01:30:29,883 --> 01:30:33,609
How high?
- 50 meters.

1365
01:30:41,669 --> 01:30:43,364
What's the matter with this
fire extinguisher?!

1366
01:30:43,364 --> 01:30:46,250
I've cleared three back rows!
- Prepare for water boarding!

1367
01:30:46,250 --> 01:30:48,121
Life jackets!
Loosen your ties!

1368
01:30:48,184 --> 01:30:50,716
Switching to generator four!
The passengers are sitting in the dark.....

1369
01:30:54,039 --> 01:30:58,527
Well, here we go! Now, with the light.
we'll be much more comfortable.

1370
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:01,397
Stay calm, we'll take the steps
and we'll take the measures required by regulation.

1371
01:31:01,397 --> 01:31:04,564
Loosen your shoes,
loosen your ties,

1372
01:31:04,564 --> 01:31:08,230
get out and put on
your life jackets.

1373
01:31:08,230 --> 01:31:10,111
I repeat: Remain
stay calm!

1374
01:31:10,111 --> 01:31:12,175
I'm sure that
everything's gonna be okay.

1375
01:31:13,349 --> 01:31:14,639
It's 20 meters high!

1376
01:31:14,980 --> 01:31:17,296
Go back and put on
life jackets!

1377
01:31:17,396 --> 01:31:18,854
Quick, we're going down!

1378
01:31:19,209 --> 01:31:20,348
He's stopping!

1379
01:31:22,090 --> 01:31:23,522
It's 15 meters high!

1380
01:31:23,522 --> 01:31:24,809
He's stopped!

1381
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:26,958
We're not sitting down, damn it!

1382
01:31:26,958 --> 01:31:28,587
Don't sit down!

1383
01:31:29,545 --> 01:31:31,990
25 meters!
- Help me with the pedal!

1384
01:31:32,667 --> 01:31:33,654
4th from the right!

1385
01:31:38,288 --> 01:31:39,623
He's stopped!

1386
01:31:39,722 --> 01:31:41,026
He's stopped!

1387
01:31:41,716 --> 01:31:43,141
You're hurt, buddy!

1388
01:31:43,303 --> 01:31:45,176
Delois, get the stewardess!

1389
01:31:45,176 --> 01:31:46,552
Leave me alone, I don't care!

1390
01:31:51,252 --> 01:31:53,447
I can't take it any higher.
- drain 2,000 liters!

1391
01:32:01,073 --> 01:32:03,858
Look, we're going up!
- I told you it would be all right!

1392
01:32:03,858 --> 01:32:05,964
Breathe! Breathe deep!

1393
01:32:05,964 --> 01:32:09,030
But why take off your shoes?
- To avoid damaging the dingy!

1394
01:32:09,201 --> 01:32:10,709
What?!
- An inflatable boat.

1395
01:32:10,709 --> 01:32:12,101
It's 50 meters high!

1396
01:32:13,175 --> 01:32:15,154
A little lower!
We can't hold on!

1397
01:32:15,154 --> 01:32:16,333
Going for 50!

1398
01:32:16,333 --> 01:32:17,599
The shore is coming up!

1399
01:32:17,698 --> 01:32:19,172
But you're hurt.
- After!

1400
01:32:19,172 --> 01:32:21,349
Get the stewardess!
- I'll be right back! - No!

1401
01:32:21,349 --> 01:32:24,764
Shall we go back, commander? - Uh, no,
no, man! We're overheating!

1402
01:32:25,126 --> 01:32:26,653
Can we go lower still?

1403
01:32:26,653 --> 01:32:28,258
No, we have to get up!

1404
01:32:28,389 --> 01:32:29,755
We won't get far that way!

1405
01:32:29,973 --> 01:32:32,557
Are you hurt? - Uh, yeah, I think
hit by a piece of shrapnel.

1406
01:32:37,177 --> 01:32:38,615
150 meters!

1407
01:32:39,575 --> 01:32:40,833
Don't go down!

1408
01:32:40,919 --> 01:32:44,047
Overheating, damn it,
overheating.

1409
01:32:51,213 --> 01:32:52,536
All right, but just
straight back!

1410
01:32:55,163 --> 01:32:57,493
Want some rum?
- All right, baby, all right!

1411
01:32:59,265 --> 01:33:01,299
The vessel we contacted
is already within visual range.

1412
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:02,588
Shall we sit down?
- No!

1413
01:33:02,588 --> 01:33:04,599
It's not like we're gonna make it to the end:
the engines are overheating!

1414
01:33:04,599 --> 01:33:06,092
No, I'll get to the end!

1415
01:33:06,867 --> 01:33:09,040
Mulino!
Take control!

1416
01:33:09,051 --> 01:33:10,511
I'll take a look at the engines.

1417
01:33:11,369 --> 01:33:12,581
Illuminate them!

1418
01:33:29,597 --> 01:33:31,670
Do you believe we're going
we'll make it to shore?

1419
01:33:32,453 --> 01:33:34,617
Congratulations:
you've trained them!

1420
01:33:34,617 --> 01:33:38,008
So what is it, commander?
- What?! We're going to Dakar!

1421
01:33:38,008 --> 01:33:39,868
Do you think we'll make it?

1422
01:33:39,868 --> 01:33:42,229
Why not? If we're going
If we're out, we're in!

1423
01:33:42,229 --> 01:33:44,062
So I can put on
my shoes?

1424
01:33:44,666 --> 01:33:46,286
Where do you want to go?

1425
01:33:47,278 --> 01:33:49,557
A barefoot man is happy!

1426
01:33:49,557 --> 01:33:50,959
There's my radio operator -
always barefoot!

1427
01:33:53,103 --> 01:33:54,703
Look at him!

1428
01:33:54,703 --> 01:33:56,635
Flying alone?
How big?

1429
01:33:56,635 --> 01:34:00,227
And she's not afraid! Or are you?
- I've seen worse!

1430
01:34:01,405 --> 01:34:03,446
What a good boy!

1431
01:34:03,446 --> 01:34:04,749
I've seen it all!

1432
01:34:07,556 --> 01:34:09,561
And your stewardess
has seen it too!

1433
01:34:10,222 --> 01:34:12,146
Yeah, we've both been through a lot, haven't we?

1434
01:34:12,146 --> 01:34:14,908
Then there's reason
to hope! Right?

1435
01:34:14,908 --> 01:34:16,869
Miracles still happen!

1436
01:34:17,595 --> 01:34:19,286
I never doubted it
I never doubted it!

1437
01:34:26,907 --> 01:34:28,725
If we don't get the rpms down,
the engines will fail!

1438
01:34:28,725 --> 01:34:30,024
Clean up on 50!

1439
01:34:31,087 --> 01:34:34,042
Vessel!
Shall I make a request?

1440
01:34:39,908 --> 01:34:42,695
The captain has the lifeboats
lifeboats at the ready.

1441
01:34:42,695 --> 01:34:44,254
Shall we sit down?
- Uh, no.

1442
01:34:44,254 --> 01:34:45,769
I won't!

1443
01:34:46,285 --> 01:34:48,016
I never drink water
before eating!

1444
01:34:48,992 --> 01:34:50,969
Come on, but, horsey!
We'll save on cab fare!

1445
01:34:51,868 --> 01:34:53,788
I'm opening the flaps:
the engines are overheating!

1446
01:34:53,788 --> 01:34:56,446
No, close it!
Otherwise we'll lose altitude!

1447
01:34:58,669 --> 01:35:03,603
Air France F-BBDK, calling
Jaffe Tower! Can you hear me?

1448
01:35:03,641 --> 01:35:04,879
Come in!

1449
01:35:09,643 --> 01:35:15,310
Air France F-BBDK, this is Joff Tower!
Can you hear me? Answer me!

1450
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:31,979
Delois! Give me
the exact coordinates!

1451
01:35:32,088 --> 01:35:34,108
Has everyone figured out how a life jacket
a life jacket?

1452
01:35:34,108 --> 01:35:35,659
Just pull the laces,

1453
01:35:35,659 --> 01:35:37,987
and compressed air tanks
will inflate your vest.

1454
01:35:37,987 --> 01:35:40,274
How much fuel did you drain?
- 2,000 liters.

1455
01:35:42,607 --> 01:35:44,419
It won't last more than
than ten minutes.

1456
01:35:45,336 --> 01:35:47,532
Make sure that the tubes
the blow tubes are free!

1457
01:35:47,572 --> 01:35:50,482
No, no more alcohol!
Check all the belts!

1458
01:35:50,655 --> 01:35:52,130
Not now, monsieur!

1459
01:35:52,165 --> 01:35:54,201
Quickly, another vest!
- Why, mademoiselle?

1460
01:35:54,201 --> 01:35:57,217
If you land on the water, you're gonna
you'll stick to the ceiling like that!

1461
01:35:57,217 --> 01:35:58,465
To the ceiling?!

1462
01:36:02,441 --> 01:36:05,331
I've made up my mind! If
we're headed for Dakar,

1463
01:36:05,465 --> 01:36:07,088
it's a five or six minute flight.

1464
01:36:07,088 --> 01:36:11,919
Air France F-BBDK, calling
Jaffe Tower! Can you hear me? Over!

1465
01:36:13,617 --> 01:36:16,043
Yoff Tower, this is
BBDK!

1466
01:36:16,043 --> 01:36:20,465
Approaching from R-0-3-4
at an altitude of 500 meters.

1467
01:36:20,465 --> 01:36:23,596
How much fuel do we have?
- It's nothing!

1468
01:36:23,596 --> 01:36:26,225
Prepare the rescue team!
Over!

1469
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:36,042
Bingo!

1470
01:36:36,322 --> 01:36:37,963
The lighthouse, it's him!

1471
01:36:37,963 --> 01:36:39,244
Where? Where is he?!

1472
01:36:39,306 --> 01:36:42,570
Notice anything?
- Yes! Dakar!

1473
01:36:42,709 --> 01:36:43,925
I see him!

1474
01:36:44,897 --> 01:36:47,367
Sorry, old man!
- Dakar! Here we go!

1475
01:36:47,473 --> 01:36:49,522
Oh, my God!
- Madam, sit down!

1476
01:36:49,522 --> 01:36:52,507
Please calm down!
It's hard to hold the plane!

1477
01:37:10,182 --> 01:37:12,773
Shortcut!
- Done!

1478
01:37:12,773 --> 01:37:14,172
Sit down, madam!

1479
01:37:14,783 --> 01:37:16,840
Sit up!
Sit up straight!

1480
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:18,655
Under no circumstances
do not unbuckle!

1481
01:37:18,655 --> 01:37:20,625
Release the landing gear!
Release flaps!

1482
01:37:21,689 --> 01:37:23,107
The chassis are out of production!

1483
01:37:28,443 --> 01:37:29,731
Let it out by hand!

1484
01:37:42,232 --> 01:37:45,146
The pulley must be jammed!
- Abort! Well, uh.

1485
01:37:45,146 --> 01:37:47,239
We're not going to land on our bellies!

1486
01:37:47,447 --> 01:37:50,097
Up! Lift!
- Lift!

1487
01:37:50,775 --> 01:37:54,146
Pick it up! - Goddamn it!
No engine, no landing gear!

1488
01:37:55,678 --> 01:37:56,853
It's out!

1489
01:37:57,990 --> 01:38:01,012
Attention! Are you okay?
- Oh, it won't be long now!

1490
01:38:07,668 --> 01:38:10,066
Pull over! Pull over!
There's not enough lane!

1491
01:39:10,782 --> 01:39:14,148
Fool!
What a fool.

1492
01:39:19,184 --> 01:39:21,114
We almost died together.

1493
01:39:21,114 --> 01:39:22,968
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

1494
01:39:24,386 --> 01:39:26,751
Then I would have stayed with you
with you.

1495
01:39:27,743 --> 01:39:29,729
Don't be silly!

1496
01:39:39,502 --> 01:39:41,157
The Commandant requests
you to the pilots!

1497
01:39:42,663 --> 01:39:44,570
Tell Mademoiselle
Mani that, uh.

1498
01:39:47,090 --> 01:39:48,852
No, you shouldn't.
Don't say anything!

1499
