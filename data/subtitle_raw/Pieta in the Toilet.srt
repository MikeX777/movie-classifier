1
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,400
the wind can be really fierce ah

2
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:09,970
this is your first time, isn't it

3
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,080
yes

4
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,850
today you'll man the winch

5
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,980
if you fell, nothing but death...

6
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,240
pick that up, help me over here

7
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:55,860
Ok

8
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,070
had a "crane faint" on your first time

9
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,880
sorry

10
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,720
now we also need more crane time

11
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:46,840
and then, we take a break

12
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:55,150
too much wind today... let's forget it

13
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,900
sorry

14
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,770
help me pick up the crane and stow it

15
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,310
Ok

16
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:27,470
Pieta
in
the
Toilet

17
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,260
starting the blood samples

18
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,760
let's label it neh

19
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,180
please hold your breath

20
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,620
what do you intend for the future

21
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,040
what do you mean

22
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,040
you have been working so much

23
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,860
ah

24
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,220
to our company, with full-time employees

25
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,900
we always feel like worms

26
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,370
insects

27
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:19,650
on the wall, attached to the building by a cable

28
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:20,830
like insects, like...

29
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,110
insects

30
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,230
insects neh

31
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,850
yes, insects

32
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,530
together that makes us insects

33
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,970
do not rub the innermost

34
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,410
dry next to it and then rub

35
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,340
Long time no see

36
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,860
Long time no see

37
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,590
you still on the cable ah

38
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:32,920
ah

39
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,650
you still painting

40
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:48,540
no, I've given up painting

41
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,540
why

42
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:56,890
I want to get married so I'm not doing it

43
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,480
you're getting married

44
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,110
no, I'm lying

45
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,710
tomorrow I'm doing my solo exhibition

46
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:10,490
right

47
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,210
"Fascinated Times"

48
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:15,630
good name

49
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:18,680
got to go

50
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,680
just who was that

51
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,900
she is my ex-college classmate

52
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,820
and ex-girlfriend

53
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:35,550
beautiful one neh

54
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:38,830
also, she's realy well to do

55
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,030
so she's also perfect

56
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,030
yes ah

57
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,050
what are you doing

58
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,920
don't do this

59
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,400
it's alright, I won't show it to others

60
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,270
that's not the problem

61
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:14,730
that is the problem

62
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,070
you, come here

63
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:28,910
no

64
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,600
you come here right now

65
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,440
I'm painting

66
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:39,160
which is more important, me or painting

67
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,440
people who ask this question are really low

68
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,330
you are the low one here

69
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,850
don't hide

70
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:00,720
oi

71
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:58,010
you know what Tanaka has on his wiper's handle

72
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,010
it says KILL

73
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:01,660
I didn't know, what the hell for

74
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,700
kill

75
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:09,540
last time, before going to work a building, Tanaka watched it and said

76
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,330
today I'll kill you

77
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:15,310
then wrote the word on it

78
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,190
he definitely has a mental problem

79
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,810
probably thinks of himself as a terrorist

80
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,870
and us, we are cable men

81
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,190
a real basket case

82
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,430
is Ozaki-san in now

83
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,470
no, she isn't

84
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,740
how long for her to come today

85
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,490
on that I'm not very sure

86
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,760
she won't come today

87
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:53,170
oh, is that so... thank you

88
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,040
thanks

89
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,480
hello... here I am at your personal exhibition

90
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,110
so you got busy today

91
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,800
Ok, good

92
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,290
listen, can I have some of your time next Tuesday

93
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,500
why should I have to pretend to be your sister ah

94
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:33,000
they asked me to bring relatives to the hospital

95
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,160
what did you think of my personal exhibition

96
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,200
good ah

97
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,120
so

98
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,610
so, I mean to say it's not only good

99
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,610
whatever that means

100
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:57,520
a while ago I won the Okura Art Award

101
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,660
it's the you've wanted some time ago

102
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,660
right... congratulations

103
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,160
oi

104
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:32,830
what

105
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,100
why this

106
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,540
anyway, you didn't take my paintings seriously

107
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,620
I didn't mean it

108
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,620
Hiro-chan, you got talent

109
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:45,270
I don't have any, I'm just a cable man

110
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,270
at the least, you were better than I am

111
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,880
even my paintings have recognition

112
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:56,900
maybe I just have to keep going farther than you

113
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:02,490
honestly, I do not care for that anymore

114
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:05,540
well, I do... goodbye

115
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,440
are you kidding

116
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,690
you've torn my school uniform

117
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,130
I have to wear this uniform to graduate school

118
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,580
you're really bad bad person, well done

119
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:24,730
I'll contact your parents

120
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:25,980
tell me their phone numbers

121
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,550
this doesn't concern my parents

122
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,930
their numbers, tell me

123
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,470
what are you watching

124
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,340
how much money for a uniform

125
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:13,640
ten thousand

126
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,310
this is one thousand

127
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,160
you're free to go

128
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,040
see you

129
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,480
this is one thousand

130
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,990
now you're my sister

131
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,540
I'm telling you, this is one thousand

132
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,170
next time I'll give you more

133
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,190
tell me your phone number

134
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:03,650
quickly

135
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,690
calling Sonoda Hiroshi-san

136
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:30,450
what you got is a stomach tumor

137
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,210
tomorrow you'll begin treatment in the hospital

138
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,460
that won't work

139
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,250
why

140
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,080
let your parents come together to talk about it

141
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:54,890
I won't do it

142
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:56,770
why ah

143
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,020
you be quiet

144
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,850
if it is so, then by doing nothing

145
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:04,240
you'll live only about three more months

146
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:33,980
frequently blurred vision, loss of appetite, fever, anemia

147
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,260
are the main symptoms

148
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,360
for this cancer, there's no specific treatment

149
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,440
it's writen

150
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,550
we still can go back

151
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,600
the hell with getting better

152
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,520
you can live easier now and die later

153
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,760
please hurry

154
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:11,810
get off

155
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:15,840
not there yet

156
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,520
off

157
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:22,960
hurry

158
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:32,580
spineless

159
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,370
how about going to my house, now

160
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:29,370
no

161
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,430
why

162
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,110
what for

163
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:35,350
I want to draw your portrait

164
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,670
so are you an artist

165
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:45,520
I don't think so, but I'm very good at drawing

166
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,830
really, just to paint me

167
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:51,940
yes

168
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,090
no, no, next time

169
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,860
then tell me your number

170
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,980
next time we meet I'll tell you

171
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:07,690
alright

172
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:18,400
I just got off work

173
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,360
ah, what people - really well done

174
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,460
why have you two come

175
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:39,980
because...

176
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,230
I'm saying I'm all right

177
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,270
we can have a good meal

178
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,720
and we go home

179
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,250
have you painted anything good

180
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:12,870
not one canvas

181
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:17,480
so there is no sense to stay in Tokyo, right

182
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,630
I, ah

183
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:27,280
I was your age and already in a very serious...

184
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,090
I don't need to cause trouble to others

185
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:34,750
actually I say it's no trouble

186
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,500
here we are, Sonoda-san

187
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:49,820
starting tonight with the anti-cancer therapy

188
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:53,630
each day you take these three times, two with breakfast, lunch and dinner

189
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,720
oh, without fail

190
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,910
you didn't eat that

191
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,570
not yet

192
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:31,770
yes

193
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:33,590
may I

194
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:39,290
ah the amount of meals here is really small, is it not

195
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,860
not enough to eat in full

196
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:48,240
may I have this too

197
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,240
dessert

198
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:01,870
right

199
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,050
I'm Yokota

200
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,230
I'm called Sonoda

201
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,660
Hiroshi

202
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:14,420
yes

203
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:19,280
I was hospitalized for esophageal cancer

204
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,890
How about you

205
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,550
stomach

206
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:27,260
stomach

207
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,080
stomach ah

208
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,800
stomach neh

209
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:39,170
hope to usher adulthood

210
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,220
formidable

211
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:39,080
good to me

212
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:42,970
hope to return to my life

213
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,160
ah disgusting

214
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:44,640
doctors

215
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,400
ah, ah, hello minister

216
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,340
today I come with a new patient

217
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,150
oh

218
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,270
can you help me to see how he is doing

219
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,240
oh

220
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:53,760
good

221
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:55,340
sit

222
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,750
please sit

223
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,680
good

224
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,770
how is your health today

225
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,380
well, it isn't good right now

226
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:13,670
don't worry, with efforts the disease can be brought down

227
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:13,970
good

228
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:16,880
please, could you show us one of your hands

229
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,160
doctor, drawing blood in this place seems quite easy

230
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:33,690
Ok, blood from this place, right

231
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,680
good, let's start

232
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:37,770
starting

233
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:46,160
please, clench your fist

234
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:48,180
first wipe

235
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,680
disinfection

236
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,500
wow, nervous

237
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:58,260
finished

238
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:01,150
good, you can relax your hand

239
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,480
that was the first one

240
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,150
ah wait a...

241
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:07,000
it's not over yet...

242
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,500
that is the side effects of anticancer drugs

243
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,300
yes, their side effects

244
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,580
after that it will be diarrhea

245
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:20,170
yes, next they'll cause diarrhea

246
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,250
Ok

247
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:52,570
you heard about the side effects of anticancer drugs, like vomiting in pregnancy, as women do

248
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,880
morning sickness ah

249
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,610
Ok

250
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:32,370
you're not really ready

251
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,520
here, for you

252
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:46,510
hold it

253
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,720
to change your mood

254
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,820
this is my favorite thing

255
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,080
giving gifts to friends

256
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:17,440
night

257
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,430
good morning

258
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:42,670
hey, you all right already

259
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:43,700
why do you ask

260
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,270
I thought you were still in the hospital

261
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:47,330
ah I'm Ok, thank you

262
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:50,500
when I saw you coming up I was really surprised

263
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:54,530
then let's get going

264
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:55,350
good

265
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,120
it looks like this seems a bit too heavy

266
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,240
sorry

267
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,290
well, I'll start cleaning the exterior wall

268
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,290
No, no do not force yourself

269
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,560
I have absolutely no problem

270
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:14,290
so today you can go rub the windows together with Noda, she's new

271
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:20,640
good

272
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,160
you go ahead, I got to go to the toilet first

273
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,080
Ok

274
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:18,810
hi

275
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,810
hi

276
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:43,830
how was that

277
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:47,340
a broken toilet faucet

278
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,530
I got caught accidentally

279
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:52,040
oh pity, you'll get cold

280
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:05,310
Hashida, you can work some overtime with me

281
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:07,310
oh, you're really mean

282
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:10,800
someone complained about leaks in the second floor toilets

283
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,080
why did this happen now

284
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:17,420
we did not use the other side of the toilet

285
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:22,350
Tanaka, I can help

286
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:23,230
no, don't worry

287
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:23,880
it's nothing

288
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:26,380
you'd better go back and rest

289
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:22,510
hey, don't just casually go rubbing shop windows

290
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:26,310
the proper thing to say to a helping hand is thank you

291
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:28,080
I told you not to rub

292
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,660
don't worry, I'm about finished

293
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,450
I'm telling you not to rub

294
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:52,590
why why why eh

295
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,820
it's my right, my job

296
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:00,540
what're you doing

297
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,080
you Ok

298
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,760
as good as it can be

299
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,080
escape can give a lot of breathing space

300
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,520
you know, it's said you can tell a dying person's time right away

301
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,680
I don't believe that

302
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,920
I don't believe it either

303
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,160
are you very busy now

304
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,800
not so busy

305
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:41,400
life in a hospital is generally not very busy

306
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,760
come with me to the lounge

307
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,640
come on, come on, just for a bit

308
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:54,910
starting tomorrow!
a great nighttime
outing!

309
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:54,910
finally able to go
out since the start of
a bout of straight
fighting

310
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:58,240
body swelling subsided

311
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,560
look at this, she didn't even blush

312
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,720
she looks like figs teacher, isn't it

313
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,230
"figs teacher"

314
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,230
with Tomoko Sasaki

315
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,840
she looks serious in over half of them, though

316
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,160
but there are funny ones

317
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,040
such as this, and this

318
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,040
why, look at that

319
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,120
very interesting

320
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,560
it doen't look funny

321
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,680
you sure

322
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,040
it looks very painful

323
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,000
painful, why

324
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,440
why

325
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,560
normally, it's generally not amusing

326
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,600
why

327
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,080
all the same, generally it's not funny

328
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:18,280
enough

329
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:28,150
brother

330
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:32,220
this for you, eat

331
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:37,080
this is also for you

332
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,930
do you know Hero Rescue Team

333
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,170
no, I don't know

334
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:47,110
you don't know...

335
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,420
you do not know it

336
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:53,530
but, it's a lot of fun to try painting it

337
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,640
see you later

338
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:22,080
I made a mistake

339
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:26,480
sorry, I gave you the one meant to Miho

340
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,840
this is his brother

341
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,730
sorry, I got to take the other back

342
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,030
it got dirty with the cake

343
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,000
I didn't mean to throw it away

344
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:59,020
I only had this one

345
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:01,420
sorry

346
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:28,240
mother, have some beer

347
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:33,150
I'll save it for a big event

348
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,240
What is it

349
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:39,800
eat it

350
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:45,310
ah I've waited since morning for dinner, at least let's enjoy it

351
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,730
Masato is not here today

352
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,710
he hasn't come back

353
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,970
if he had come back, it'd be just fine

354
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:57,220
could you help your grandmother to bathe

355
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:12,440
brother, how are you feeling today

356
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:18,040
this is for you

357
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:27,020
this is for the gods, so they can hear our prayers

358
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:31,310
don't be bothered with what happened before

359
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:36,350
I gave you the wrong drawing and the cake together, it wasn't your fault

360
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:38,020
see you later

361
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:47,370
civilization originated in places with water

362
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:53,510
that is because moisture is essential to the growth of crops

363
00:46:55,910 --> 00:47:01,910
and large cargos can travel through river channels

364
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,680
thus the use of river transport

365
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:06,920
so, water was essential for the development of civilization

366
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,300
but then

367
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,800
60 percent of our own body is water

368
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:17,300
that only emphasizes the importance of water

369
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:21,200
this is very important, please copy down the blackboard carefully

370
00:47:27,950 --> 00:47:29,240
I need to go to the toilet

371
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:35,710
you're being a stalker, a lolicon

372
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:39,510
and while you idle in the hospital, I'm busy

373
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:45,620
here

374
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:56,750
here

375
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:00,800
what

376
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,730
plus errands fee

377
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:17,770
looks easy

378
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
what

379
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,420
hospital life

380
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:26,910
it is not

381
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:31,730
carefree adult's life

382
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:53,640
is this what you eat every day

383
00:48:55,950 --> 00:48:56,570
yes

384
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:05,280
unedible

385
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:20,370
what

386
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:23,440
nothing

387
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:37,440
at my age, it's a crime

388
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:41,260
I'm not interested in children

389
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,840
got to go

390
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,170
who's the child

391
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:31,820
my sister

392
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:32,680
don't lie

393
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:37,860
her lips, she has just such lips

394
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,480
she kissed you in the lips

395
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,170
there were sister kisses for you

396
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:45,700
there was no kissing, so wipe your mouth

397
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:51,640
me, I won't wipe mine... your mouth is the one she kissed

398
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:26,950
bye bye, folks

399
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:28,740
bye bye - goodbye

400
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:35,770
so... this is for you

401
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:39,680
wow, it's amazing

402
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:41,250
my own drawings

403
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:44,730
amazing, can I keep it

404
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:45,660
yes

405
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:47,280
nice

406
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,820
a great gift

407
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:51,330
I'm his mother, we appreciate your gift

408
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:52,530
nice to meet you

409
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:55,930
do you draw often

410
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:58,970
not now, I don't

411
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:00,730
this is so

412
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:05,530
look at this, amazing

413
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,150
amazing, very nice

414
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:11,020
thank you very much

415
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:13,170
handsome

416
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:31,660
excuse me, can I have one

417
00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:32,480
sure

418
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:54,460
so many days of rest

419
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:56,460
and the company won't keep him longer

420
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:58,680
I often say

421
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:01,330
it's not fun working in this company

422
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:04,930
Yokota-san showed some nerve saying that there's a lot of people

423
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:07,840
but he didn't get nervous hearing he might be fired

424
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:09,510
that's not it

425
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:11,930
you don't know that

426
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:12,970
don't I know

427
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:14,550
that's not it

428
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:16,750
really

429
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:19,060
looks like it

430
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:34,080
hey, want to eat some

431
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:39,050
it was just brought by my younger colleagues

432
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,040
no, thanks

433
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:52,870
it seems I have to hurry back to my company

434
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:57,730
as if the company is a mess without me there

435
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:09,480
on second thoughts, I could eat one

436
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,460
no, I won't let you

437
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:24,460
I beg you, be a good grandmother now

438
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:27,530
as if this'd give back my stolen clothes

439
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:32,640
nothing of the sort

440
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:37,660
we're your family, in our own home now

441
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:39,970
we won't steal

442
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:41,530
it's not nice to steal

443
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:11,170
I'm tired

444
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,860
stop

445
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,510
really, give me a little candy, Oita

446
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,730
stop ah

447
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:18,680
you're going to meet your boyfriend, right

448
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:19,880
kiss fiend

449
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,080
not yet kissing

450
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:24,750
what, I envied you that

451
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:25,910
nice

452
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:27,840
nice ah, I also want to have a boyfriend

453
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:28,820
the game is the game

454
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:30,240
you aren't also a virgin, right

455
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:22,710
why aren't you at school

456
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,600
it's not fun

457
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:30,880
so you are more unfortunate than others

458
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:36,420
yes... and I wanted to look if you got better

459
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:49,060
stand up and look at me

460
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:57,020
and now show how to properly kiss

461
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:00,310
really, the man should lead

462
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:02,020
maybe

463
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:04,510
try to do something

464
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:06,310
do something

465
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:08,880
still shy

466
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:11,220
still silly

467
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,200
come here

468
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:57,440
what do you like

469
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:20,680
this

470
00:58:21,770 --> 00:58:23,860
excuse me, I want to buy this fish

471
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:30,740
what'll you do with them

472
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:33,260
confidential

473
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:40,220
ah Hiro-chan

474
00:58:41,570 --> 00:58:42,550
let's introduce you

475
00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:46,550
how are you doing

476
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:48,620
Ok

477
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:50,130
ah

478
00:58:50,930 --> 00:58:52,640
he is my college classmate Sonoda

479
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:53,840
Nice to meet you

480
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,110
this is the writer, Sakai-san

481
00:58:56,910 --> 00:58:59,800
my personal exhibition was possible thanks to Sakai-san's recommendation

482
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:02,020
right, because her work is not very good

483
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:03,270
as if that could be true

484
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:09,860
we think you are very talented neh

485
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:12,060
next time let me see your work

486
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:13,910
if you let me, I'll help you

487
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:16,200
that doesn't interest me

488
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:18,400
doesn't it

489
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:25,460
I hate people like you

490
00:59:26,110 --> 00:59:27,550
you can just make such good work

491
00:59:27,550 --> 00:59:29,950
but thinking it cannot be recognized, that it does not matter

492
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:35,330
no matter what you do, we don't need people with such attitude

493
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,000
let's go

494
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:49,950
excuse me

495
00:59:54,510 --> 01:00:00,320
that dress you're wearing, deliberately looking soiled

496
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,990
that's a rustic chic look

497
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:31,040
bring them over

498
01:00:58,940 --> 01:00:59,820
good

499
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:20,330
come ah

500
01:02:22,330 --> 01:02:23,930
I'm tired, I'll stay here

501
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:26,860
those really boring people

502
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,600
why they despise the sick man

503
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:55,680
hey look, look

504
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:07,930
do you want to see my underwear

505
01:03:14,550 --> 01:03:17,220
come dive into the water and you can see them, oh

506
01:03:22,930 --> 01:03:23,930
you'll see

507
01:03:24,910 --> 01:03:25,970
come on

508
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:35,110
satyr

509
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:36,640
or not

510
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:57,600
I'll be discharged tomorrow

511
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:03,240
although our time together wasn't long, thank you for your attention

512
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:09,630
going to work tomorrow

513
01:04:09,850 --> 01:04:11,800
of course, going to the company

514
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,370
I wasn't away from the company that much, but enough to risk dismissal

515
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:42,660
saying how people should or shouldn't live

516
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:45,640
that doesn't make sense

517
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:48,840
nor does this rat race we live in

518
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:52,720
also, the food chain frowns on fraternization

519
01:04:59,350 --> 01:05:01,500
so Yokota-san, why are we alive

520
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:08,870
for me, it is because

521
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:11,200
I don't want to die now

522
01:05:41,310 --> 01:05:42,220
are you all right

523
01:06:01,470 --> 01:06:03,470
thank you, I'm fine

524
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:07,110
be careful

525
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:26,040
sorry to have dragged you here

526
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:30,060
Takuto's the one who wanted us to pray together

527
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:35,510
it's nothing, anyway I was idle

528
01:07:11,970 --> 01:07:14,260
this statue, you know what it is, right

529
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:16,350
it is the Pieta

530
01:07:17,730 --> 01:07:18,820
I learned as a student

531
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:22,370
holding a dead son

532
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:27,370
how can she look so serene

533
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:39,280
well, the doctor said his life expectancy was only six months

534
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:42,020
but because of the treatment efforts

535
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:43,730
now he may get through the year

536
01:07:45,370 --> 01:07:48,240
he has a major surgery soon ahead

537
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:50,040
and if the surgery goes well

538
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:52,200
maybe he'll be able to leave the hospital

539
01:07:58,200 --> 01:07:59,710
that child has been sick so much

540
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:01,910
I think a lot about it

541
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:08,930
why does my child have to bear such pain

542
01:08:12,620 --> 01:08:15,330
but if you can overcome the disease

543
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:19,370
you'll be more cherished than others

544
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:21,040
for the rest of your life

545
01:08:21,930 --> 01:08:24,680
so it's necessary to stay strong

546
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:47,950
what's this ah

547
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:50,910
it's not practice

548
01:09:11,770 --> 01:09:12,860
oi, wait

549
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:14,480
oi

550
01:09:17,950 --> 01:09:21,370
why don't you paint anymore

551
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,460
that girl is so fast

552
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:42,310
yes ah

553
01:09:53,930 --> 01:09:55,600
Hey wait

554
01:09:58,730 --> 01:09:59,820
running away

555
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:01,620
that's wicked

556
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,460
terrific ah

557
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:42,330
Takuto

558
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:43,880
what

559
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:48,640
I also have a surgery soon

560
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:50,750
we can make it

561
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:53,440
ah restarting

562
01:10:53,950 --> 01:10:54,510
ah

563
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:57,330
restarting

564
01:11:31,530 --> 01:11:32,680
so wicked ah

565
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:34,020
I got 11 points

566
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:36,680
where's Takuto

567
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:37,530
Takuto

568
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:38,640
he was discharged from the hospital

569
01:11:42,490 --> 01:11:43,660
the "gada gada"

570
01:11:44,090 --> 01:11:45,400
into the red

571
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:47,570
the wrong ones snap and fall

572
01:11:50,950 --> 01:11:52,240
how are you feeling

573
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:54,620
Ok

574
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:56,150
good

575
01:11:57,530 --> 01:12:01,200
test results will take a while to get right to my office

576
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:03,170
Ok

577
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:06,930
hello

578
01:12:07,910 --> 01:12:08,710
I got to go

579
01:12:10,130 --> 01:12:10,970
hello

580
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:12,950
sit

581
01:12:17,370 --> 01:12:19,060
Takuto was discharged, nice ah

582
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:23,220
you heard it from somebody

583
01:12:24,370 --> 01:12:26,060
in the hospital, they told me

584
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:28,060
so ah

585
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:31,130
is Takuto alright

586
01:12:35,530 --> 01:12:37,340
Takuto...

587
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:41,000
is gone

588
01:12:44,950 --> 01:12:46,710
there are some hospital rules

589
01:12:47,150 --> 01:12:49,580
they cannot say that a child has died

590
01:12:50,730 --> 01:12:54,260
so, when Takuto left us, they said it was a discharge

591
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:03,950
about that

592
01:13:06,810 --> 01:13:10,570
help me painting some of Takuto's drawings

593
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:13,280
paint anything you choose

594
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,530
I'll keep them with me always, Sonoda-san

595
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:19,530
you can paint from Takuto's videos

596
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:23,750
please

597
01:13:25,460 --> 01:13:26,150
no

598
01:13:26,150 --> 01:13:27,260
paint anything you want

599
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:32,840
sorry

600
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:39,770
I just dabble

601
01:13:44,370 --> 01:13:45,600
I see

602
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:50,840
I embarrassed you, I'm really sorry

603
01:13:56,590 --> 01:14:00,160
thank you very much to have taken care of us

604
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:46,090
how I wish I could skip living here and now

605
01:15:14,970 --> 01:15:16,570
can't you come and play now

606
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:19,510
no, not so near dinnertime

607
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:21,600
why eat so unedible stuff

608
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,600
go out and eat good food, that should do it

609
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:27,170
I have to eat here, now

610
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:30,090
then you come see me eat

611
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,220
it's Ok if you go cycling

612
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:33,710
why

613
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:34,930
you can treat me ah

614
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:35,970
no can do

615
01:15:36,310 --> 01:15:37,200
please

616
01:15:38,710 --> 01:15:39,910
then go to the nearby cafe

617
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:41,530
no can do

618
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:43,130
don't be capricious

619
01:15:43,530 --> 01:15:45,130
no, no, don't

620
01:15:46,770 --> 01:15:48,570
I'm sorry, I have to go back

621
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:03,030
why this now, I don't like it

622
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:06,860
you keep refusing reasonable requests

623
01:16:07,570 --> 01:16:09,110
and also plead sickness as an excuse

624
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:10,570
so cunning

625
01:16:11,370 --> 01:16:12,220
cunning, when

626
01:16:12,220 --> 01:16:12,930
every time

627
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:16,040
you do it too

628
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:17,900
I wasn't born with twisted thinking

629
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:19,350
I have to say

630
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:21,530
cool your temper

631
01:16:21,530 --> 01:16:23,180
I have a right to my temper

632
01:16:24,150 --> 01:16:27,610
there are many people more miserable than you

633
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:29,130
I don't care if there are

634
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:31,240
I became real real sick

635
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:32,850
I'm also sick ah

636
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:43,110
go... figure your wrongs

637
01:16:45,530 --> 01:16:46,240
just drop dead

638
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:47,000
you just drop dead

639
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:52,510
I tell you

640
01:17:54,510 --> 01:17:56,510
don't get stuck in a dead end, mopping the floor

641
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:05,470
don't look like tere's no one you love alive

642
01:18:26,350 --> 01:18:29,840
the inspection found that the cancer has metastasized into the peritoneum

643
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:34,800
so you want to discuss options, Sonoda-san

644
01:18:35,950 --> 01:18:38,670
on guidelines for future treatments

645
01:18:40,770 --> 01:18:44,430
it's feasible to continue chemotherapy

646
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:46,420
but then

647
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:50,060
side effects become a great burden to the body

648
01:18:51,530 --> 01:18:55,090
the alternative is to stop chemotherapy

649
01:18:57,750 --> 01:18:59,510
not having to care about the side effects

650
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:04,820
resting at your home or a nursing home

651
01:19:07,310 --> 01:19:12,680
of course, this way it's impossible to inhibit cancer cell proliferation

652
01:20:32,980 --> 01:20:35,430
why did you hang old butterfly painting in the room

653
01:20:38,060 --> 01:20:41,020
your father found the painting decorative so he put it in a frame

654
01:20:41,390 --> 01:20:43,020
after you got hospitalized

655
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:49,890
how is your physical condition

656
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:53,560
so so

657
01:20:54,630 --> 01:20:56,470
then, take good care

658
01:21:04,470 --> 01:21:05,440
about that

659
01:21:09,050 --> 01:21:11,420
I'm considering whether or not to go to a nearby hospital

660
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:07,170
they turn dirty soon, anyway

661
01:22:07,170 --> 01:22:09,170
it doesn't pay to rub the windows

662
01:22:22,970 --> 01:22:24,690
you are grown, now

663
01:22:26,310 --> 01:22:27,460
28

664
01:22:29,950 --> 01:22:31,560
28, ah

665
01:22:33,270 --> 01:22:35,440
oh yes

666
01:22:36,620 --> 01:22:39,040
where are you keeping your paintings

667
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:42,080
in Tokyo

668
01:22:53,230 --> 01:22:56,170
you can make some money, you can sell me one now

669
01:22:57,340 --> 01:22:59,500
you don't have to give me money, I'll send you one for free

670
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:01,500
well, well, I want to buy it

671
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:02,510
no

672
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:04,510
don't mention it

673
01:23:04,510 --> 01:23:05,760
I don't need it

674
01:23:20,090 --> 01:23:22,660
I have been, in fact, a great fan of yours

675
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:26,510
but I couldn't speak about it openly, sorry

676
01:26:20,610 --> 01:26:23,540
what, I'm busy

677
01:26:25,870 --> 01:26:26,780
sorry

678
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:32,380
what is it ah

679
01:26:38,330 --> 01:26:40,240
I want to finally say hello to you

680
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:43,500
what does it mean

681
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,220
I'm going to a hospital in the countryside

682
01:26:50,890 --> 01:26:52,730
you're not there yet

683
01:27:01,730 --> 01:27:02,480
eh

684
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:10,250
you're not going to die yet

685
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:29,130
goodbye

686
01:27:37,060 --> 01:27:37,790
eh

687
01:27:47,190 --> 01:27:48,130
are you free right now

688
01:27:50,940 --> 01:27:52,280
killing time

689
01:28:50,370 --> 01:28:51,560
don't splash me

690
01:29:22,130 --> 01:29:23,170
recently neh

691
01:29:25,170 --> 01:29:27,890
I ran very hard

692
01:29:29,370 --> 01:29:34,090
I thought I could run near to dying, so I tried to run

693
01:29:37,150 --> 01:29:42,140
and get really really close to it

694
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:49,400
but I didn't die

695
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:04,360
it's not so easy to die

696
01:30:16,830 --> 01:30:17,860
where are you going

697
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:19,860
to get medication

698
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:21,360
I forgot to eat

699
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:26,940
about this, it won't matter, right

700
01:30:28,140 --> 01:30:29,010
what won't matter

701
01:30:29,010 --> 01:30:30,630
you don't have to die

702
01:30:31,090 --> 01:30:33,090
you take the pills, you don't die

703
01:30:35,190 --> 01:30:37,800
it doesn't matter any longer, right

704
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:47,060
it doen't matter any longer

705
01:30:58,090 --> 01:31:02,230
you have not really accepted the fact that we're all going to die ah

706
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:08,690
I know that

707
01:31:16,770 --> 01:31:18,510
I'm reconciled though it pains me

708
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:24,290
also, it's hopeless

709
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:28,490
so quit this kid act saying I don't know how it is

710
01:31:41,970 --> 01:31:43,330
it was my first time

711
01:31:46,770 --> 01:31:48,000
you have to take responsibility

712
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:55,030
and no

713
01:31:56,500 --> 01:31:57,500
you cannot die

714
01:32:04,140 --> 01:32:06,470
I'm still alive, you have to live with me ah

715
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:20,650
come on, ride

716
01:32:22,020 --> 01:32:23,680
I'm sick

717
01:32:24,430 --> 01:32:25,970
but you're a man, right

718
01:32:39,970 --> 01:32:40,600
neh

719
01:32:48,190 --> 01:32:50,900
what do you do to prolong your life

720
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:16,100
I want to spend the rest of my time at home

721
01:33:17,350 --> 01:33:20,490
where is it that you want to live, in your parents' home...

722
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:24,270
no, in my flat here

723
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:26,720
you do

724
01:33:28,140 --> 01:33:28,720
yes

725
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:32,990
so, that's it

726
01:33:39,570 --> 01:33:40,340
I understand

727
01:33:47,870 --> 01:33:48,850
and another one

728
01:33:48,850 --> 01:33:50,230
right right right

729
01:33:52,620 --> 01:33:53,960
so

730
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:54,800
right right

731
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:56,420
face to the side

732
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:02,180
good

733
01:34:02,490 --> 01:34:04,960
completely back to me the following

734
01:34:05,550 --> 01:34:07,070
hand stays here

735
01:34:07,620 --> 01:34:08,440
like this

736
01:34:09,610 --> 01:34:10,450
like this

737
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:23,350
hello

738
01:34:23,970 --> 01:34:24,810
hello

739
01:34:26,050 --> 01:34:27,150
you came back ah

740
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:31,010
still the same issue

741
01:34:33,090 --> 01:34:34,980
I also came back

742
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:40,880
are you free right now

743
01:34:57,780 --> 01:34:58,810
what are you doing

744
01:35:00,510 --> 01:35:01,260
what

745
01:35:06,530 --> 01:35:08,340
pick up that chair

746
01:35:10,190 --> 01:35:11,020
get it up here

747
01:35:16,450 --> 01:35:17,890
what do you want to repair

748
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:21,380
the step stool could get handy

749
01:35:28,110 --> 01:35:30,600
also, get my the pot of paint

750
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:33,490
which pot

751
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:34,880
thre're two - both

752
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:43,420
here you go

753
01:35:43,420 --> 01:35:43,980
brushes

754
01:35:45,370 --> 01:35:46,820
thank you

755
01:35:53,450 --> 01:35:56,000
what do you want to do

756
01:35:57,220 --> 01:35:58,580
painting

757
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:05,290
but why painting in the toilet

758
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:18,220
because it represents purification and ascension

759
01:36:24,390 --> 01:36:26,350
ah you don't say

760
01:36:26,750 --> 01:36:27,790
I guess it does

761
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:43,620
coming true ah

762
01:38:14,730 --> 01:38:18,530
hey, is this Ok

763
01:38:20,120 --> 01:38:20,530
good

764
01:38:28,940 --> 01:38:32,110
also, the change for these

765
01:38:32,420 --> 01:38:33,290
I'll put it here

766
01:38:33,450 --> 01:38:34,310
thank you

767
01:38:40,100 --> 01:38:41,220
good good

768
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:50,040
it looks weightless, like...

769
01:38:53,580 --> 01:38:55,910
a really scary jump

770
01:38:55,910 --> 01:38:57,650
the weightlessness, the weightlessness

771
01:39:04,750 --> 01:39:06,770
besides the girls I usually shoot, ah

772
01:39:09,110 --> 01:39:10,900
it's the first I shoot something else

773
01:39:14,350 --> 01:39:15,550
my pleasure

774
01:40:27,870 --> 01:40:29,250
you got a good ass there

775
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:32,030
you help me shoot mine

776
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:33,460
why

777
01:40:33,460 --> 01:40:34,460
you have to help me shoot it

778
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:35,260
do I

779
01:40:35,260 --> 01:40:36,650
let me give you this

780
01:40:36,830 --> 01:40:38,120
I'll show I have a good one, too

781
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:41,240
good good

782
01:40:43,890 --> 01:40:45,260
not ready to film yet, not yet

783
01:40:46,230 --> 01:40:47,260
now, ready to film

784
01:40:48,700 --> 01:40:49,690
this isn't your ass

785
01:40:50,290 --> 01:40:51,690
get off, you

786
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:57,640
you peeling off and no one to look

787
01:40:59,730 --> 01:41:01,090
how about this

788
01:41:01,770 --> 01:41:03,700
a really good looking butt ah

789
01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:04,370
you see, you see

790
01:41:04,850 --> 01:41:05,870
you come back one o'clock

791
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:07,520
what

792
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:08,330
over one o'clock

793
01:41:18,260 --> 01:41:19,300
I ah...

794
01:41:22,730 --> 01:41:26,880
for decades I've been desperately trying

795
01:41:28,230 --> 01:41:29,770
to win this cancer

796
01:41:30,660 --> 01:41:33,210
I thought I had been healed, a remission

797
01:41:34,910 --> 01:41:39,120
now every Monday to Friday I'm doing radiotherapy

798
01:41:40,390 --> 01:41:44,360
I can be discharged for one month after two months doing this

799
01:41:44,890 --> 01:41:46,820
then it's back to the hospital

800
01:41:47,300 --> 01:41:51,760
two more months of radiotherapy before being discharged for a month

801
01:41:52,510 --> 01:41:54,590
and so on, repeatedly

802
01:41:59,170 --> 01:42:04,590
this said world, it hardly changes

803
01:42:05,690 --> 01:42:07,800
it's all exactly the same

804
01:42:10,140 --> 01:42:13,840
and so, it can be very cruel

805
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,080
you know it

806
01:42:19,220 --> 01:42:20,740
it changes only by itself

807
01:42:30,280 --> 01:42:35,090
I have nowhere to go from here on

808
01:44:18,650 --> 01:44:19,520
congratulations

809
01:45:58,970 --> 01:46:01,520
where did he go from the hospital, tell me now

810
01:46:01,730 --> 01:46:04,790
apart from the patient's family, it's not...

811
01:46:04,790 --> 01:46:06,790
you can tell me where he went to

812
01:46:07,290 --> 01:46:12,510
I am sorry, due to the privacy of all concerned we cannot disclose this information

813
01:46:12,510 --> 01:46:14,690
I don't see how this can work

814
01:46:14,950 --> 01:46:16,560
you have to tell me ah

815
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:20,430
I am sorry, we have to comply with the rules

816
01:46:20,700 --> 01:46:22,220
that doesn't wash with me

817
01:46:22,890 --> 01:46:23,890
sorry

818
01:46:23,890 --> 01:46:25,120
hurry, tell me

819
01:46:25,230 --> 01:46:26,680
sorry

820
01:46:26,750 --> 01:46:27,920

821
01:46:32,650 --> 01:46:35,630

822
01:46:36,930 --> 01:46:37,910
who are you

823
01:46:42,830 --> 01:46:46,430
I'd have suffered a lot without the care of your brother

824
01:46:48,590 --> 01:46:52,740
very, very much

825
01:46:59,030 --> 01:47:00,220
you have to reconcile

826
01:48:10,970 --> 01:48:12,600
really well done

827
01:48:18,510 --> 01:48:20,320
really well done, that guy

828
01:48:44,030 --> 01:48:45,330
even if you painted this thing

829
01:48:45,330 --> 01:48:47,840
it's useless for you now ah

830
01:48:52,700 --> 01:48:56,680
you didn't deliberately paint to die eh

831
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:04,170
he didn't paint to die

832
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:21,760
he didn't

833
01:49:37,660 --> 01:49:38,290
what are you doing

834
01:50:05,120 --> 01:50:07,290
how do you make yourself want to die

835
01:50:12,270 --> 01:50:13,530
I don't know

836
01:50:16,640 --> 01:50:17,620
sorry

837
01:50:44,460 --> 01:50:45,280

838
01:50:46,670 --> 01:50:47,230
