"You damned clan of evil spirits..."

00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:48,460
"Disperse. "

11
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:51,714
"Disperse!"

00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:11,358
"Scatter into hell!"

13
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:21,243
"Sink!"

00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:50,022
<i>I will never fall in love again</i>

15
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:59,657
<i>with someone from
another province.</i>

16
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:06,538
<i>Because it will end</i>

20
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,772
What is it Koheiji,
apprentice of Danjuro?

21
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:34,233
Weren't you with my husband?

22
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:38,112
<i>Taku had the manager read his new play
and is waiting for his response.</i>

23
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,406
<i>So I left ahead.</i>

24
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:42,032
I see...

25
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:45,244
He must be really glad
to hear that response!

26
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:49,039
<i>Don't worry.
It will definitely be favorable!</i>

27
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:52,751
I'm taking a bath right now,
you know.

28
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:54,378
Listen!

29
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:59,049
<i>The sounds made by Ochika
while jumping into the bath.</i>

30
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:02,803
Well then now...

31
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:07,808
It's about time for the princess
to get out and play.

32
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:13,397
<i>Ochika, would you allow me to see
Kannon's figure while taking a bath?</i>

33
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:18,569
The entrance fee for seeing the Goddess
is quite expensive you know.

34
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:22,573
<i>How much is it?
3 Ryo?</i>

35
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,033
No.

36
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:25,326
<i>10 Ryo?</i>

37
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:27,161
That's nothing!

38
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,787
<i>1000 Ryo?</i>

39
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:33,834
Even if you pile up 10000 Ryo,
you won't be allowed to see me.

40
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:36,045
<i>Then What Will it be?</i>

41
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,672
One kimono to my liking.

42
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:40,215
<i>Let's seal the deal.</i>

43
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:43,969
<i>Ochika-san fell down, she fell</i>

44
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:47,473
<i>For one kimono, she fell</i>

45
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:51,852
<i>To see the Goddess Ochika</i>

46
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,730
<i>One kimono as offering</i>

47
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:58,233
<i>A beautiful bath is appreciated</i>

48
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:01,862
<i>My eyeballs are about to be crushed</i>

49
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:05,741
<i>Tears of gratitude start to fall</i>

50
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,243
<i>To fall down.</i>

51
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:12,373
- My dear Goddess!
- Cheer!

52
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:14,500
Highly esteemed Ochika!

53
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,960
What's with that bamboo rake?

54
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,630
I won this at a tombola.

55
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:23,884
- And my husband?
- He drew an umbrella.

56
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:27,596
Ochika, you'll be sharing
that umbrella. Dammit!

57
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,890
Sharing an umbrella?

58
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,601
That doesn't sound too bad,
Danjuro's apprentice.

59
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:35,145
I may be an actor at a humble
kabuki theater right now, but...

60
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:40,401
- ..."once I achieve my ambition", right?
- Right. Once I achieve my ambition,

61
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:46,281
and become like Ichikawa Danjuro VII, the most
popular and best kabuki actor in Japan right now!

62
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:49,118
Cheer!

63
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:54,540
As a New Year's custom I'll show you
one of my magic glares!

64
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,757
Cheer!

65
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:20,065
- Where's Ochika?
- Ochika went to Joshuya's to buy sake.

66
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,068
How did it go?
Did the manager approve it?

67
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:26,697
After all the blood and sweat
shed to complete this script...

68
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:31,326
He said: "I can't put this on stage.
Your bribe ain't enough" and he returned it.

69
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:34,788
Don't mind, don't mind!
Once you achieve your ambition...

70
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:38,709
I may be a humble musician right now, but one clay
I'll be the best kabuki author of Japan.

71
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:41,712
As famous as Chikamatsu Monzaemon.

72
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:44,214
That's if I achieve my ambition...

73
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,591
<i>I'm home!</i>

74
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,844
Oh! Have you returned, my dear?

75
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,929
<i>Dammit, there are lots of mosquitos.</i>

76
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:55,309
<i>Ochika, hang the mosquito net.</i>

77
00:07:56,351 --> 00:08:00,481
<i>“The bamboo rake of prostitute Kannon“, huh?</i>

78
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:03,984
<i>“The umbrella of Ono no Komachi“</i>

79
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:16,246
This reminds me of my childhood.

80
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,999
The "childhood" when you were elegant.

81
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:23,629
- When we were kids, huh?
- When we were kids, snot-nosed kids.

82
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:28,091
One rainy day, I took out
a new paper umbrella...

83
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,344
Do you remember?

84
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:32,471
I've ripped that umbrella...

85
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:36,767
After ripping the new umbrella,
Ochika's father hit you.

86
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:40,312
Kohei was beaten by my father.

87
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:42,564
Despite being beaten
again and again...

88
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,692
...the snot-nosed kid
didn't apologize.

89
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:48,195
"What's learned in the cradle
is carried to the grave."

90
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,405
"As the twig is bent,
so grows the tree."

91
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:54,826
- Once upon a time...
- ...there were three kids.

92
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,079
There were three kids.

93
00:08:57,204 --> 00:09:01,333
- Little Ochika was the landlord's daughter.
- I was a pretty girl.

94
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:04,211
My father was
a primary school teacher.

95
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,213
I was the child of a traveling actor.

96
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:10,300
- The three of them lined up their desks...
- ...and practiced writing.

97
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:13,095
Kohei's writing was always sloppy.

98
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,849
- He was always playing pranks.
- Painting Ochika's face with ink.

99
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:21,728
- I wonder if I hit him out of anger?
- You hit, scratched and bit him!

100
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:24,606
Little Ochika was
the landlord's daughter.

101
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,610
Everybody hated the snot-nosed kid
and the tenement house owner's child.

102
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:33,115
- The three had grown up.
- Ochika had become a beauty.

103
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,618
- I fell in love with Ochika.
- Without giving in, I also fell for her.

104
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:39,496
Ochika became the bride
of a very rich man.

105
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:44,710
- She became his wife, but...
- ...she quarreled with the bridegroom...

106
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:50,841
- ...and she became a divorced woman.
- She became a divorced woman.

107
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:53,635
- She did.
- She became a divorced woman.

108
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,764
I courted the divorced woman:
"Please become my wife!"

109
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:01,351
Without giving in, I courted her, too:
"Please become my wife!"

110
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:05,647
The divorced Ochika
became Takuro's wife.

111
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:08,025
The three childhood friends..

112
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,861
- The three childhood friends...
- ...cried and laughed.

113
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:13,280
- Shall we...
- ...go home or somewhere else?

114
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:14,281
...go home?

115
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:18,660
- Kohei it's about time for you to go home.
- It's difficult to leave, and I'm afraid to go home.

116
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,663
Even if you're afraid,
go home.

117
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:28,170
<i>“The Love Suicide At Kiso Bridge“</i>

118
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:31,173
<i>“Oshige - Taro, the last journey act“</i>

119
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:34,509
<i>“Oshige, let's die.“</i>

120
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:38,555
<i>“Let's commit suicide.
Let's die.“</i>

121
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,941
Why don't you go to bed already?

122
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,779
This is bad for your health.

123
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:02,954
What did the manager say?

124
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:06,958
Has the manager read it?

125
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:10,712
Shut up!

126
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:13,340
You did it again...

127
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:14,966
Bitch!

128
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:18,220
Don't stick your nose
into a man's work!

129
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:53,880
I want to break up.
Let's break up.

130
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:58,385
Write me a divorce letter.
Please give me a separation letter!

131
00:11:58,593 --> 00:11:59,761
Get out.

132
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,139
Get out of my sight!

133
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,391
I'll go.

134
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:22,803
<i>Bamboo, bamboo pole.</i>

135
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,185
<i>Get out, god of poverty!</i>

136
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:32,979
The god of good fortune

137
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:37,108
came in an auspicious visit to mount this
everlasting bamboo pole as an offering.

138
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:39,861
<i>My husband's out at
a theater meeting.</i>

139
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:43,615
First of all, in order to finish this
while your husband is away,

140
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,494
the God of Fortune will come in
to take the measure.

141
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,579
Excuse me.

142
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:04,219
God of Fortune, why don't you set up
the bamboo pole over there?

143
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:08,515
Ochika,
please become my wife!

144
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:13,520
I really wanted to ask you this
for a long time.

145
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:19,276
No matter what,
I can't die in peace, if I give up.

146
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:22,529
Out of the blue!
My husband's away!

147
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:25,156
Go home!
Get out! Get out!

148
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:28,368
I'm fine with dying here today
biting off my tongue,

149
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:31,246
But let me say
what I want to say.

150
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:35,667
The God of Poverty carrying a bamboo
pole does nothing but complain!

151
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:40,005
That Taku, he hit and
kicked you, Ochika.

152
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:44,801
On top of that he even dragged you
around by pulling your hair.

153
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:51,308
It proves a man's true worth you know,
because it shows he truly adores his wife.

154
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:56,438
"Let's break up, let's break up!"
"Give me a divorce letter!", was that a lie?

155
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:59,816
Are you going to endure it,
even after being hit and kicked?

156
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:03,528
Be it hitting or kicking,
I'll endure everything,

157
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:07,198
since I entrusted this body to him
in both, joys and sorrows.

158
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:09,826
If he weren't around...

159
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:15,290
For example, if he were dead,
will you become my wife?

160
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,083
Who knows.

161
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,961
What if I kill him?

162
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:25,342
Do you really have
the guts for that?

163
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:29,596
I'm gonna kill him and
make you my wife.

164
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:33,475
He strips Ochika naked...

165
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:37,228
At night, when I imagine Taku
to embrace and sleep with you,

166
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:39,564
I feel like I'm going insane.

167
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,317
I'll take my chance.

168
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:44,361
I'll tell him:

169
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,489
"Give Ochika to me."

170
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:51,117
He's not the type of person
who'd let me go.

171
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:53,495
He'd rather die.

172
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:58,500
Be a man and give up,
Koheiji.

173
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:00,377
No.

174
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:02,504
No way. No way.

175
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:07,759
It seems like I'm pregnant.

176
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:09,719
It's true.

177
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:13,640
I'm a pregnant woman.

178
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,039
Hey Kohei!

179
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:45,380
What's with that sorry ass posture?
You're looking depressed.

180
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:50,385
- Lend me some money!
- To pay off a woman again?

181
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:52,303
Good guess.

182
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:56,641
Let's go over there and
have a drink. Almsgiver Taku.

183
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:01,646
<i>We're home! We're back!</i>

184
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:06,276
<i>- The Honourable Chikamatsu Monzaemon...
- ...and the Honourable Ichikawa Danjuro...</i>

185
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:08,862
<i>...are home!</i>

186
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:12,032
Where have you been so long
and what were you doing, huh?

187
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:16,161
We're going on a journey Ochika!
We'll leave tomorrow early in the morning!

188
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:19,622
- As agreed upon.
- All three of us on a pleasure trip.

189
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:22,125
At the old elementary school,
the friends lined up their desks:

190
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:25,420
- "Even the blossoming flowers..."
- "...will eventually scatter"

191
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,297
- "...will eventually scatter."
- "...will eventually scatter."

192
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,009
I'll gladly go on a pleasure journey.

193
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:34,304
No road is long
with good company.

194
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:48,068
Sake time!
It's time for some sake to celebrate!

195
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:56,201
Coward!
"Give me your wife!", have you told him that?

196
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:03,458
Hey, almsgiver Taku,
you'll lend me some money right?

197
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:07,087
If we don't bring the money tonight
I won't be able to leave.

198
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,465
- So, hurry up and ask Ochika.
- Money again?

199
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:14,552
I've impregnated a girl,
so I need some money to pay her off.

200
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:18,223
- Is that true my dear?
- That discussion is over, over!

201
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:20,433
It's time to celebrate our excursion!

202
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:24,229
I don't want to.
Since you've left me out of the loop.

203
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:27,107
You two should go on this journey.
I won't go!

204
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:31,069
<i>Ochika got angry,
she got so angry</i>

205
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:35,073
<i>She became a demon,
she became a snake.</i>

206
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:38,368
<i>Koheiji made a beggar's bastard</i>

207
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:42,122
- <i>That's</i> right.
- <i>He doesn't even have one penny to offer.</i>

208
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:46,126
<i>Takuro made a raccoon dog child.</i>

209
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:52,257
<i>The raccoon dog's testicles
are huge, so huge.</i>

210
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:56,219
<i>Ochika laughed, she laughed</i>

211
00:18:56,344 --> 00:19:00,265
<i>The enlightened Goddess of Mercy
is grateful.</i>

212
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:04,519
<i>The Goddess of Fortune
is grateful.</i>

213
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,336
Everybody, let's act a play for fun!

214
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:14,839
A play for fun...
What play should it be?

215
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:19,469
"The Treasury of Loyal Retainers"
"Act VI - Kanpei's seppuku"

216
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:23,848
"Without making any excuses,

217
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:33,358
Kanpei will perform seppuku
to end the grief within your hearts..."

218
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:36,296
MARUYA INN

219
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:23,968
<i>Year by year,</i>

220
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:28,222
<i>the sound of Negoro Temple's
ringing bell</i>

221
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:37,565
<i>can be heard from as far</i>

222
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:45,073
as a <i>mile</i> away,

223
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:51,871
<i>it's echoes resound
as far as two.</i>

224
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:21,109
I don't want to give birth
to this child.

225
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,652
Why?

226
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:27,115
I don't want to. I won't give birth to it.

227
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:31,035
If you regret it afterwards,
it'll be too late.

228
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:33,621
I don't want it!

229
00:23:34,664 --> 00:23:37,667
Because I have a frail body.

230
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:44,173
If you want to abort the child...

231
00:25:01,751 --> 00:25:04,378
Hey, don't exert yourself.

232
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:08,257
- Have you seen Ochika?
- Isn't she at the inn?

233
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:11,010
No. Where did she go?

234
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:32,865
What's the matter?

235
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:48,292
Why did you conceal from me
that you were pregnant?

236
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:53,673
You're tedious.
How many times must I tell you?

237
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:57,885
I'll keep asking until you bow
and apologize.

238
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:01,681
There was nothing that could be done
about the miscarriage!

239
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:04,934
Come now, let's go.

240
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:09,188
You're vexing! Vexing!

241
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:12,441
What's wrong? Hurry up!

242
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:28,833
<i>Not of this world is the story...</i>

243
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:31,085
I can hear it...

244
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,214
- I can hear, I can hear it...
- What?

245
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:39,176
The infant's cries.

246
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,888
What do you think?
It's stylish, isn't it!?

247
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:34,273
<i>I will never again fall in love...</i>

248
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:41,489
Ta-ra-ra, Boom-de-ay!

249
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:43,407
Now...

250
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:50,414
I bring the props that we ordered
some time ago.

251
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:07,181
"Will you hit me?

252
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:10,309
Will you beat me?

253
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:14,772
Will you kill me
with your own hands?

254
00:30:15,815 --> 00:30:23,823
I'm afraid that won't make me
take you as my lover. "

255
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:32,790
In all the eight-hundred-and-eight
districts of Edo,

256
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,293
everybody knows me for my kimono
adorned with the peony-seal

257
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:39,839
that I wear walking under the cherry
blossoms of Nakanocho Street.

258
00:30:39,964 --> 00:30:43,592
I'm the youth known as
Sukeroku of Hanakawado,

259
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:49,348
but I'm also known as
Agemaki's Sukeroku!

260
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:53,477
(Pause shortly after stomp.)

261
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:59,483
Bow before this face!

262
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:08,826
Worship it!"

263
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:17,001
Congratulations!

264
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:23,507
Well then, we're finally going on tour
in two days and Ochika will join us.

265
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:27,469
I wonder if it will be under
a bad or a good luck omen.

266
00:31:31,265 --> 00:31:35,728
Good luck... excellent luck.
Setting off will be okay.

267
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:44,403
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

268
00:31:47,615 --> 00:31:49,909
Wearing that...
Won't you get ready?

269
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:54,496
- At dawn, in my dream, the Grim Reaper...
- The Grim Reaper?

270
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:59,919
...was holding a fan upside down
in his right hand, looking depressed.

271
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:05,132
- Don't conjure it up. Heaven forbid.
- Therefore, I gave up on this trip.

272
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:07,801
Disperse evil spirits, disperse!

273
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:10,179
Taku, spread some salt for cleansing!

274
00:32:10,304 --> 00:32:14,516
Already done. Stop this nonsense.
Just say that we quarreled!

275
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:19,563
- I won't go. Not for the life of me!
- Got it! I won't talk you into it.

276
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:22,691
Then, let's go Taku.
Everybody's waiting.

277
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:26,695
- Ochika, take care of the house.
- I will.

278
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:37,706
Have a safe trip!

279
00:32:56,976 --> 00:33:00,729
- I forgot something.
- What did you forget?

280
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:06,443
On this tour, I'm gonna tell Taku:
"Give Ochika to me!"

281
00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:10,489
You'd better not!

282
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:13,492
He's totally crazy about me.

283
00:33:13,826 --> 00:33:16,203
It's much more than infatuation.

284
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:19,456
Trying to convince him will be
like talking to a wall.

285
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:23,961
No matter if Taku's like that,
awake or asleep, I won't leave it be.

286
00:33:24,253 --> 00:33:26,005
I can't give up.

287
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:30,217
What fate is this, when in my dreams
I'm always like "Ochika, Ochika"?

288
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:36,390
Be a man and give up, Koheiji.

289
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,225
Listen.

290
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:42,521
If Taku were to die,
will you become my wife?

291
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:48,152
- Who knows.
- I'll take my chance and do it.

292
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:51,739
"Hurray!", "Cheers!",
is what I'd like to say,

293
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:56,660
But he'll never let me go,
until the clay he dies.

294
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:59,496
I'll do it even if it kills me.

295
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:02,750
<i>Hey! Koheiji!</i>

296
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,878
Yeah! I'm coming right now!

297
00:34:06,754 --> 00:34:08,672
I'll do it even if it kills me.

298
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:55,839
Since tomorrow's a day off,
do you want to go fishing?

299
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:59,384
I hear that you can catch some big ones.

300
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:06,767
To be honest, I have a favor
that I'd like to talk to you about.

301
00:37:39,508 --> 00:37:42,135
Give Ochika to me.

302
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:45,138
Give her to me.

303
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:46,932
Give her.

304
00:37:48,642 --> 00:37:51,311
I planned to tell you this one day.

305
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:57,192
You must've suspected something from the
backstage rumours for a long time, right?

306
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:01,571
But it's not true,
that I'm intimate with Ochika.

307
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:06,660
I've never held her hand,
nor touched her even once.

308
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:12,791
Shamelessly asking
for another man's wife...

309
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:16,420
...is what a scumbag would do.

310
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:20,299
It's fate. Karma, you know.

311
00:38:22,092 --> 00:38:24,303
I can't help it.

312
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:27,681
I feel like I'm going insane.

313
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:29,558
I beg you.

314
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:33,437
I beg you!

315
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:40,068
I can't die in peace this way.

316
00:38:41,695 --> 00:38:45,449
I'll kill you
and make Ochika my wife.

317
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:50,620
Ochika did nothing wrong.

318
00:38:52,581 --> 00:38:54,583
As God is my witness.

319
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:55,876
Stop it!

320
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:00,756
Bastard.

321
00:39:01,882 --> 00:39:06,136
How dare you speak so shamelessly...
about another man's wife!

322
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:33,372
Die! Die!

323
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:37,292
Die! Die!

324
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:32,472
Who is it, this late?

325
00:40:32,848 --> 00:40:36,351
<i>It's me Ochika! It's me!</i>

326
00:40:37,436 --> 00:40:39,479
ls it you, my dear?

327
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:56,830
What's with that outfit?

328
00:40:56,997 --> 00:40:59,374
You look like a sewer rat!

329
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:03,378
Haven't you been with the others?
What about Kohei?

330
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:06,840
Kohei's dead. He died.

331
00:41:08,008 --> 00:41:11,887
Kohei is dead?
I won't fall for this kind of trick.

332
00:41:11,887 --> 00:41:16,475
I killed him! Kohei made his move,
and I killed him!

333
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:20,353
Dear, you killed Kohei?

334
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:25,400
He told me: "Give me Ochika.
Even if it kills me."

335
00:41:25,484 --> 00:41:30,030
He'd kill me to make you his wife.
He was saying things like that.

336
00:41:31,907 --> 00:41:35,494
While we're talking, the authorities
might make their move.

337
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:38,413
After the murder,
I disbanded the troupe.

338
00:41:38,914 --> 00:41:42,125
Night and day I blindly tried to
come home, sleeping outside,

339
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:45,045
traveling at night,
even when it rained heavily.

340
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,547
I barely slept.

341
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:50,425
I'm a mess.

342
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,761
In any case, there's no escape.

343
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:56,515
Either you give yourself up,
or you kill yourself.

344
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:57,933
Right?

345
00:41:59,059 --> 00:42:03,271
Koheiji was my childhood friend,
and I've just killed him.

346
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:08,443
I've thought of killing myself,
but couldn't bring myself to do it.

347
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:14,032
Whatever the final outcome may be,
being with you, I don't care if I live or die.

348
00:42:14,074 --> 00:42:17,536
Whatever will be will be,
I'll give in to desperation.

349
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:22,165
I feel like my head's about to explode,
and I'm going insane.

350
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:25,418
Asleep or awake, Koheiji...

351
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:32,467
Didn't you once say: "No doubt, Koheiji's the
kind of guy, who won't die in his own bed"?

352
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,844
What shall I do?

353
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:39,057
You can hit or kick me,
I'll endure everything,

354
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:41,935
since I entrusted this body to you
in both joys and sorrows.

355
00:42:41,977 --> 00:42:45,063
Come on now, my husband,
wash your feet

356
00:42:45,105 --> 00:42:48,358
and let's discuss this quietly again.

357
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:50,360
The authorities might come.

358
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:54,823
We'll think about that when the time comes.
Haste makes waste.

359
00:42:58,368 --> 00:43:00,078
Come on, Dear.

360
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:28,523
I am alive.

361
00:43:29,733 --> 00:43:35,280
The 'Immortal Koheiji' won't die
until he achieves his ambition.

362
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:37,407
Thank God!

363
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:40,285
Thank God!

364
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:41,995
Ochika, bring some sake.

365
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,030
Forgive me!

366
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:30,210
Let's not dwell on past events tonight.

367
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:34,839
Let's be the three childhood friends again,
who lined up their desks

368
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:36,675
and practiced writing together.

369
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:40,095
How about acting a play for fun?

370
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:44,849
The final act of Chikamatsu Monzaemon's
famous "Love Suicides at Sonezaki."

371
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:50,105
We have all the costumes.
Ochika quickly change!

372
00:45:15,255 --> 00:45:21,219
<i>“Farewell to this world,
and to the night farewell.</i>

373
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:27,475
<i>We who walk the road to death,
to what should we be likened?</i>

374
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:34,399
<i>To the frost by the road
that leads to the graveyard“</i>

375
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:50,623
- Taku!
- What is it Kohei?

376
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:54,252
Let me have Ochika as my wife.

377
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:57,046
Let me have her as my wife.

378
00:45:57,297 --> 00:46:00,508
- Give her to me.
- Try asking Ochika!

379
00:46:00,884 --> 00:46:04,804
Ochika... please become my wife.

380
00:46:06,139 --> 00:46:09,058
I'll make you my wife
even if it kills me.

381
00:46:09,142 --> 00:46:10,769
Hurray.

382
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:14,439
Once you achieve your ambition...

383
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:18,318
I'll call you my Ochika.

384
00:46:20,195 --> 00:46:24,282
<i>I will never again...</i>

385
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:26,326
You bitch!

386
00:46:28,328 --> 00:46:29,662
Stop it!

387
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:08,576
Run away! Let's run away!

388
00:48:05,258 --> 00:48:12,807
<i>I will never again...</i>

389
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:18,438
<i>...fall in love with someone...</i>

390
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:32,035
<i>...from another province.</i>

391
00:48:34,037 --> 00:48:42,962
<i>Because it will end...</i>

392
00:48:44,464 --> 00:49:00,104
<i>...with a separation in tears.</i>

393
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:38,726
Even if you kill him...

394
00:49:39,018 --> 00:49:41,479
Even if you kill him,
he won't die.

395
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:44,524
Damn obstinate guy!

396
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:49,904
In accordance with his nickname,
Living Koheiji, he'll follow us everywhere.

397
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:51,406
Shut up!

398
00:49:52,115 --> 00:49:54,242
For how long will you keep grumbling?

399
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,745
Last night at the inn...

400
00:49:58,371 --> 00:50:01,416
...the one that got into the bathtub
was definitely Koheiji.

401
00:50:01,791 --> 00:50:05,920
It's just your imagination,
because you're extremely nervous.

402
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:08,047
Even in the hallway...

403
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:12,176
...he was peeking from
a pillar's shadow.

404
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:18,057
Even the strange guy in the next room,
who was heating an empty kettle...

405
00:50:18,307 --> 00:50:21,144
Maybe you've gone crazy?

406
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:25,064
Shhh!

407
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:18,326
- Do you hear those footsteps, right now?
- I don't hear anything.

408
00:51:18,743 --> 00:51:20,620
I can hear them.

409
00:51:21,454 --> 00:51:23,498
Wasn't somebody peeking in?

410
00:51:23,956 --> 00:51:26,751
They say that even a fool
needs to take a break!

411
00:52:17,426 --> 00:52:21,764
<i>Koheiji made a beggar's bastard</i>

412
00:52:23,266 --> 00:52:27,687
<i>He doesn't even have one penny to offer.</i>

413
00:52:29,564 --> 00:52:32,817
Since this is a journey without escape...

414
00:52:33,276 --> 00:52:36,445
Why don't you, gallantly and
remorsefully, surrender?

415
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:42,410
If it were me, I would've turned myself in
to the magistrate, like a man.

416
00:52:44,203 --> 00:52:47,081
How dare you say such cold things!

417
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:57,592
Let's break up after all.

418
00:52:58,092 --> 00:53:00,553
Even tho I've followed you this far...

419
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:03,973
I really don't like this aimless journey.

420
00:53:04,182 --> 00:53:05,933
I'm sick of it.

421
00:53:14,192 --> 00:53:16,319
Do you understand?

422
00:53:16,485 --> 00:53:19,864
A Letter of Separation...
Divorce me.

423
00:53:22,116 --> 00:53:28,623
Seeing your head displayed on a wooden pole
at the prison gate is not that far away.

424
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,880
It's our fate that we were both born
under an unfortunate sign.

425
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:40,468
Parting ways around here
will be best.

426
00:53:48,142 --> 00:53:50,269
What should I do?

427
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:54,023
Don't leave me alone.

428
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:56,651
Help me.

429
00:53:59,487 --> 00:54:03,032
You're the only one in this world
I can depend on.

430
00:55:58,105 --> 00:56:00,733
Well? Surprised?

431
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:03,652
Did you think I ran away?

432
00:56:03,986 --> 00:56:07,656
Since you're too sloppy,
I tried to play a trick on you.

433
00:56:07,907 --> 00:56:11,160
I was quietly observing you
from the shadows.

434
00:56:13,788 --> 00:56:15,539
Coward, stop being so afraid!

435
00:56:19,168 --> 00:56:22,880
You've told Koheiji that you
were pregnant, didn't you?

436
00:56:23,506 --> 00:56:27,426
Treating me like a cheating woman?
As you please!

437
00:56:32,932 --> 00:56:34,141
Let go!

438
00:56:40,189 --> 00:56:42,316
You call yourself a man?

439
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:47,154
Brute!

440
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:33,617
At dawn...

441
00:57:34,618 --> 00:57:36,996
I dreamed of Koheiji.

442
00:57:39,248 --> 00:57:43,502
So, what about it?
Was Kohei resenting you?

443
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:47,506
He did nothing and
was very depressed.

444
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:49,341
Is that all?

445
00:57:50,885 --> 00:57:53,888
After killing my childhood friend...

446
00:57:53,888 --> 00:57:56,474
I wonder why I'm traveling.

447
00:57:57,641 --> 00:58:00,019
What am I living for?

448
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:10,779
Let's commit suicide.

449
00:58:13,282 --> 00:58:14,617
Let's die.

450
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:20,915
Let's die!

451
00:58:26,045 --> 00:58:34,929
<i>I will never again fall in love
with someone</i>

452
00:58:35,638 --> 00:58:43,187
<i>from another province.</i>

453
00:58:45,064 --> 00:58:51,445
<i>Because it will end...</i>

454
00:58:52,571 --> 00:59:00,079
<i>with a separation in tears.</i>

455
00:59:16,554 --> 00:59:17,846
Die!

456
00:59:33,821 --> 00:59:37,199
TSUTAYA INN

457
01:00:13,736 --> 01:00:15,154
Who's there?

458
01:00:54,902 --> 01:01:01,325
Some strange guy was in the hallway.
It might have been Koheiji!

459
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:04,453
"The ghost, when examined closely,
was withered silver grass."

460
01:01:04,536 --> 01:01:06,955
Get a grip, dammit!

461
01:01:07,081 --> 01:01:12,461
At the village festival, I drank
and had fun with a young man.

462
01:01:12,795 --> 01:01:16,340
The market is quite noisy,
as usual.

463
01:01:44,576 --> 01:01:48,747
A coward, a drummer and a murderer!

464
01:01:50,708 --> 01:01:52,584
So funny!

465
01:03:29,223 --> 01:03:30,724
Koheiji...

466
01:03:33,852 --> 01:03:35,604
Forgive me!

467
01:03:48,492 --> 01:03:50,869
I can't go any further.

468
01:03:51,745 --> 01:03:53,580
My leg hurts.

469
01:03:54,832 --> 01:03:57,125
I'm cursed with it.

470
01:03:58,502 --> 01:04:01,338
Don't mind me and go on ahead!

471
01:04:03,882 --> 01:04:08,512
Regrettably, our relationship is indissoluble.
I can't leave you right now.

472
01:04:09,638 --> 01:04:13,725
Taking advantage of someone's
weakness is inhuman.

473
01:04:17,271 --> 01:04:20,983
This is creepy.
Human figures.

474
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:37,416
Someone's death curse.

475
01:04:38,417 --> 01:04:40,377
A woman's vengeance?

476
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:51,305
Women are said to have 800 million and
3000 worms inside their bodies.

477
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:56,560
And men are the beasts,
who eat these worms, right?

478
01:05:22,836 --> 01:05:26,840
Let's drive away the evil.

479
01:05:28,175 --> 01:05:33,972
Let's drive away the evil.

480
01:05:36,475 --> 01:05:45,192
Let's drive away all evil by the living and
the dead from Buddha's Universe.

481
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:49,988
We will drive away the evil.

482
01:05:51,365 --> 01:05:55,702
We will, we will certainly do.

483
01:06:34,783 --> 01:06:37,786
It seems like we'll soon
reach Sai-no-Kawara.

484
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:42,416
I'll go ahead, so you just take your time.

485
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:29,087
<i>Saying prayers for
the happiness of father</i>

486
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:33,967
<i>they heap the first tower of stones</i>

487
01:07:35,469 --> 01:07:40,474
<i>Saying prayers for
the happiness of mother,</i>

488
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:44,978
<i>they heap the second tower of stones</i>

489
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:52,486
<i>Saying prayers for their brothers
and their sisters,</i>

490
01:07:52,986 --> 01:08:03,997
<i>and all whom they loved at home,</i>

491
01:08:04,748 --> 01:08:11,379
<i>they heap the third tower of stones</i>

492
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:23,183
<i>Such, by day,
are their pitiful diversions</i>

493
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:26,436
<i>But when...</i>

494
01:08:33,985 --> 01:08:45,122
<i>But whenever the sun begins to sink
below the horizon,</i>

495
01:08:45,622 --> 01:08:52,462
<i>the Oni, the demons of the hells, appear...</i>

496
01:08:52,754 --> 01:08:56,091
The child that you miscarried,
who's child was it? Tell me!

497
01:08:58,510 --> 01:09:00,095
Are you doubting me?

498
01:09:00,887 --> 01:09:02,097
Who's child was it?

499
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:07,519
If I'd say that it was Kohei's child,
what will you do?

500
01:09:18,363 --> 01:09:19,781
You bitch...

501
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:22,367
Worms!

502
01:09:28,415 --> 01:09:32,377
Write me a divorce letter!
Don't treat me like a fool!

503
01:09:33,044 --> 01:09:36,923
After committing adultery the bitch
is putting on airs! Dammit!

504
01:09:37,549 --> 01:09:40,051
I've misjudged you!

505
01:09:40,302 --> 01:09:44,389
Didn't I always tell you, that it's
a shame to doubt someone?

506
01:09:45,182 --> 01:09:48,560
Those who trust in others,
are pure hearted people.

507
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:52,689
Believing this, I've lived,
and followed you, until this clay.

508
01:09:53,815 --> 01:09:56,443
So, you were doubting me.

509
01:09:57,068 --> 01:09:59,654
You don't understand
a woman's heart.

510
01:10:00,697 --> 01:10:04,409
The miscarried child,
was truly yours.

511
01:10:06,077 --> 01:10:07,162
Come now...

512
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:13,585
Kill me, leave me, kill yourself or whatever,
just do exactly as you please!

513
01:10:13,668 --> 01:10:15,170
You whore!

514
01:10:15,962 --> 01:10:17,339
Die!

515
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:18,840
Die!

516
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:20,842
Die!

517
01:10:28,475 --> 01:10:30,435
Die!

518
01:11:00,882 --> 01:11:03,134
I cheated death twice.

519
01:11:03,385 --> 01:11:07,514
The Grim Reaper, that bastard,
fled twice from my back.

520
01:11:09,516 --> 01:11:15,272
Look, right now the Grim Reaper is
sitting on Taku's back, laughing.

521
01:11:22,529 --> 01:11:27,993
<i>Ochika laughed,
she laughed out loud</i>

522
01:11:34,374 --> 01:11:40,297
<i>Ochika got angry
She got so angry</i>

523
01:11:41,256 --> 01:11:47,012
<i>She became a demon,
she became a snake</i>

524
01:11:47,554 --> 01:11:50,307
Demon or a snake,
I don't care.

525
01:11:51,182 --> 01:11:53,935
I'm gonna make Ochika my wife.

526
01:11:56,563 --> 01:12:01,693
Koheiji, sticking your hands into other people's
pockets to steal... Are you a thief?

527
01:12:03,403 --> 01:12:09,451
Sneaking up to other people to steal
someone's wife... You're a foul guy!

528
01:12:10,285 --> 01:12:12,037
You wanted Ochika...

529
01:12:12,537 --> 01:12:14,080
Takuro...

530
01:12:15,290 --> 01:12:18,335
I kept harassing you.

531
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:25,800
I thought that, if I drive you mad,
you'll die from insanity.

532
01:12:29,054 --> 01:12:31,806
Until one of us dies...

533
01:12:32,807 --> 01:12:36,102
no matter how far we'll go,
this play will never end.

534
01:12:37,979 --> 01:12:39,189
Ochika.

535
01:12:43,485 --> 01:12:45,362
I'm gonna kill you!

536
01:12:45,987 --> 01:12:46,988
Die!

537
01:12:47,864 --> 01:12:48,990
Die!

538
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:59,811
<i>Not of this world is the story of sorrow</i>

539
01:14:00,645 --> 01:14:14,200
