1
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,640
Oh, crap...

2
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,158
What are you doing here?

3
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:21,240
Well...
What are you doing here?

4
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,840
This is my place.

5
00:02:22,841 --> 00:02:24,718
I was in a real struggle.

6
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:26,878
On Facebook, you were tagged
on holidays until next week.

7
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,878
The caretaker gave me the keys.

8
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,199
You disappear for 3 years
and you show up, unannounced?

9
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:33,878
Don't sweat it, I'll clean up.
I didn't know.

10
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:36,638
Shut up, already!
When Camille sees the mess...

11
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:38,799
- I'll talk to her...
- Clean your damn mess!

12
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,718
I'm on it!
Why the hell are you yelling for?

13
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:44,918
- She'll be there in 5 minutes.
- Oh, hell... Good morning!

14
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:47,439
- Goodbye, rather.
- You got to chill.

15
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,999
You're a pig.
Clean this up! Faster!

16
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,999
- I'm on it!
- Give it to me, come on.

17
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,559
Go clean there.

18
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,400
It's just quick declutter.
Why freaking out?

19
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,239
You were to arrive next week.

20
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,438
You're a pig, look at that!

21
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:02,878
- I didn't know!
- Can't you wash the dishes?

22
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,359
- I didn't know...
- Drop it, it's pointless.

23
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,318
- I didn't do anything.
- Drop it.

24
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,240
You're such a pig, look.

25
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,478
- Hello, Camille.
- Hi.

26
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:15,080
To start off...
Congratulations, I guess?

27
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,960
Don't sweat it, I got this.
I'll handle everything.

28
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,038
Focus on the baby.

29
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,038
Positive energy,
that's what matters.

30
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:27,038
- I'll be gone in the next hour.
- What are you doing here?

31
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:28,279
No, don't tell me.

32
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,239
I'll book a hotel.

33
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,400
I want this place to shine,
and you to go.

34
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,839
As for the two of us,
our plans are unchanged.

35
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,680
We'll eat burgers
while watching comedy movies.

36
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,039
Have a nice baby shower.

37
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Bye, I guess.

38
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,160
ROMANTIQUE

39
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:23,318
How's work?

40
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:24,399
Good.

41
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,560
I changed companies a month ago.

42
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,120
It's better.

43
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:30,839
Great.

44
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,278
So you're no longer working
with tuxedo douchebags?

45
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:36,040
I've dropped it.

46
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,559
So? What is it, now?
Architect?

47
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,398
Well... no.

48
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:43,040
I won't go into details.

49
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,160
Basically, I am now charged to tell
tuxedo douchebags to fill Excel charts.

50
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,399
You're right, it's better.

51
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,359
Don't give yourself the chance
to make a living

52
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,439
out of one of your hobbies,
it would be too bad.

53
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,438
What about you?

54
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:59,319
How's music doing?

55
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,600
And this stadium tour?

56
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,479
I don't play anymore.

57
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,159
People still aren't ready
to witness my talent.

58
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,438
Yeah.

59
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:09,839
We've got time.

60
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:13,078
Don't you miss architecture?
You were good at it.

61
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,680
Yes, but it's not the time, yet.

62
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,878
Antoine bought a house.

63
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:21,758
Naturally, he gave me blueprints.
I supervise the works...

64
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,638
I get on with this
whenever I'm off of work.

65
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,838
Well, it's great.
Got any photos?

66
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:30,318
No, but I've got the keys.
Do you want to have a look?

67
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,399
Yeah, totally.

68
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,920
Doesn't it get you inspired?

69
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:37,079
I told you, it's not the time.

70
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,318
There's the baby, there's work...

71
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:42,720
Let's get out of here.
I'm stuffed.

72
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:46,479
- Yeah. Can we get the bill?
- Sure.

73
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,599
- Are we splitting, or...
- No, this one's on me.

74
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
There you go.

75
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,680
Let's see...

76
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,240
Time to shine.

77
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,919
The pepper on the peaches,
really tasteful.

78
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,438
- I really appreciate it.
- I've noticed too.

79
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:05,560
Oh yeah?
Well, I appreciate it.

80
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,878
- Crap, it got declined.
- Really?

81
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:11,318
- Do you need the receipt?
- No, thank you.

82
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:13,120
- Okay, one more try?
- Yes, yes.

83
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,399
Thank you.

84
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,240
I may have mistyped the code.

85
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,639
Declined.

86
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,599
It's definitely declined.

87
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,838
- I'll bring my paycheck.
- Are you nuts?

88
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:29,359
- Forget it, I'll pay.
- Well...

89
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,039
You're such a pain in the ass.

90
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,878
I couldn't know,
my bank account isn't empty.

91
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:36,559
You made a deposit
with money you got on the street

92
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,638
and there was a problem?

93
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:40,160
You won't fool me.
Honestly, this is rude.

94
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,878
Where did this come from?

95
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:45,239
You tell me it's on you,
but it ends up on me.

96
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,559
- I'm sorry, but this is rude.
- No...

97
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,599
Now, guys, chill.

98
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,639
It's fine, it's fine.

99
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,518
And it's on you. Okay?

100
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,679
I'll give you pocket money,
if you want.

101
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,518
- Shots on me, what do you say?
- Oh, okay.

102
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:01,240
And we'll be able to look
at the bright side of life.

103
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,559
- Thank you very much.
- There.

104
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,239
Cheers, guys.
Let me see your smile.

105
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,759
To our father-to-be.

106
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:09,920
You have to make
the most of it, now.

107
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:27,600
You're gonna be a dad!

108
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,119
- To the father-to-be!
- It's gonna be great!

109
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,398
I'll handle this like a boss!
I'm running things great.

110
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:42,599
I'll stay clean as hell!

111
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,639
Either way,
you can't be worse than Dad.

112
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,720
Oh, there's the radar.

113
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:57,879
Hi.

114
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,758
I see you've been having an eye on me,
this whole time.

115
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,680
Let me be clear: it's a no.

116
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,639
Listen, sweetheart.

117
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,438
With a body like yours,
you can't have a king like me. Ciao!

118
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:12,479
Sorry, this is my brother.
He gets annoying when he's drunk.

119
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,198
He definitely is.
But he's got money.

120
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,958
He'll go and get us drinks
while we're dancing, okay?

121
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:21,160
- Perfect.
- Go get us some drinks, come on.

122
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,039
Look...

123
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,440
I'm off to bed.

124
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,120
I'll get one hour of sleep
before Camille gets here, or...

125
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,919
Well, let's get moving.

126
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,759
You'll be okay?

127
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,120
Yes, don't worry.

128
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,798
Come on. Let's go.

129
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:58,159
Oh, hell...

130
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,999
- Bye, brother.
- Good night.

131
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,240
Take care.

132
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,399
Good morning, sir.

133
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,558
Please pack your stuff and go.

134
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:18,080
You need permission for that.

135
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:21,798
Oh, okay.
Sorry, I didn't know that.

136
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:23,000
Papers, please.

137
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:26,638
You won't believe this,
but my wallet got stolen,

138
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:28,840
in this bar, last night.

139
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:31,999
I was actually waiting for them
to open to ask them

140
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,798
whether they had retrieved
something or not.

141
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,678
And I started a gig here,
in the meantime.

142
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:37,279
I'll pack my stuff and I'll wait.

143
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,679
Look, we'll get a fine
sent to your address.

144
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,518
Okay.

145
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,839
Name and address, please.

146
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,200
Well... Romain Gary.

147
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,159
G.A.R.Y.

148
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:54,159
8 alley Emile Ajar.

149
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,000
18th arrondissement of Paris.

150
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,558
You'll receive the fine
within 72 hours.

151
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:06,519
If you don't find your wallet,
go to the police station.

152
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:10,119
- Sometimes, they get there.
- Good idea, thank you.

153
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,679
- Have a nice day.
- Thank you.

154
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,159
Thank you for your kindness.

155
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,600
You're not there.

156
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,039
It's not you.

157
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,600
You're dead.

158
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,360
Either you're in jail...

159
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,159
Or you're on the edge of a cliff...

160
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:16,638
Or you've jumped
under a freaking metro.

161
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,798
But you're definitely not there.

162
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:19,918
Wait, Salomé...

163
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:21,439
Shut up! Shut up!

164
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,600
I'll fuck you up.

165
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,839
- Wait, Salomé...
- Fucking ghost!

166
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,558
Where were you?

167
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:29,479
Did you think
you could abandon me?

168
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,159
You actually believed it!

169
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,599
Choose your words wisely.
It's been 3 years and a half.

170
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,398
You see this?
I could hear them whiten.

171
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:42,679
I'll explain myself.

172
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:44,439
After you calm down.

173
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,719
Don't ask me to calm down!

174
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,439
Don't ask me to calm down.

175
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,439
You... Not a word.

176
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,679
You shut up, don't say a word!

177
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:56,759
I thought you were dead.

178
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,719
I thought you were dead!

179
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,758
You had plans
for a road-trip in France

180
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:04,879
and a cocoon with a view
on the rooftops of Paris.

181
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,119
While I actually never got out of Paris.

182
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,720
I still live in an apartment
with a view on dog shit.

183
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,158
So, think wisely.

184
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:16,919
Think before you explain to me
why I'm feeling this dumb.

185
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,360
I was in danger.

186
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
And...

187
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,359
I won't go into details,
it was quite tough.

188
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,120
I couldn't share it with you,
or you would have been in danger.

189
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,319
- So you're a spy.
- No...

190
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,518
Stop laughing!

191
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,079
I'll kill you!

192
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,360
I freaked out!

193
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,599
I freaked out, I panicked.

194
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,278
I thought I couldn't do it,
so I left for a few days.

195
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,798
I thought it would subside,
but after a few weeks,

196
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:45,918
it was still there.

197
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,678
Then, I didn't know what to do...

198
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:49,878
Sir, is this yours?

199
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:51,080
No...

200
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,519
And then,
I got a job offer in New York.

201
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:02,758
And here I am,
I just landed in Paris.

202
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,399
I wanted to see you.

203
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:06,919
Well, you've seen me. Happy?

204
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,559
Could we grab a coffee together?

205
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,279
I'm busy.

206
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,080
This weekend?

207
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:18,199
There he goes, insisting...
I'm busy.

208
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,919
- Are you still working a lot?
- Yeah.

209
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:24,719
And I am a mother
of a 3-years-old little girl

210
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,239
who doesn't know her father.

211
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,759
It gets me quite busy too.

212
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,519
Wait, Salomé.
Salomé, wait! Salomé!

213
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,039
Wait!

214
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:45,279
Wait, guys! Guys...

215
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:47,398
What do you think you're doing?

216
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:49,199
These are my belongings,
not trash.

217
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,320
We found this on the ground,
we didn't steal anything.

218
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:53,518
I put it on the ground.
I was talking to my ex.

219
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,960
Why didn't you say anything?

220
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:57,719
I didn't want to look like a tr...

221
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,119
Look, I'm busy.
This is all I have, give it back.

222
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,158
We're on the same boat.

223
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,839
Except these are not yours.

224
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,038
Oh yeah? Then prove it.

225
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,758
Please, don't threaten me
with my racket.

226
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:11,959
- Put it down.
- Yeah, put it down.

227
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,279
- Let's make a deal.
- Yeah, I like making deals.

228
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,119
I'll keep my charger, I need it.

229
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,199
Okay.

230
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,319
I'll take my keyboard back,
you don't have a gig, do you?

231
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,678
Keep the rest of it. Are we good?

232
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:25,840
Alright, but I want your jacket.
It looks soft.

233
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,398
No wonder it's soft,
it's a silk-cotton blend.

234
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,039
Handle it with care.
Don't put it in the washer.

235
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,360
It's really soft.

236
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,319
- Wow!
- Don't get too comfortable.

237
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,120
You're fine with the jacket.

238
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,319
It was a pleasure
doing business with you.

239
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,519
Thank you, bye.

240
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,480
This jackass gave me his jacket!

241
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:52,398
Don't worry about the jacket,
we only wash cold.

242
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,440
It looks like you do.
It smells like it too.

243
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,398
I'm sorry, Salomé.
Wait, let's talk for a minute.

244
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:04,038
- And here you are, again.
- Wait.

245
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:05,839
You can't bring up such things
and just leave.

246
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,038
You left first. Out of my sight.

247
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:10,079
I just want to meet her.
What's her name?

248
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,398
Just leave, already.

249
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:14,359
- Help, help! Help me!
- Stop that!

250
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,758
- It's okay.
- It's not okay.

251
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,439
This guy is stalking me.
He's been spying on me every morning.

252
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,599
- This is nonsense.
- Help!

253
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,079
- Help me!
- Get off of her!

254
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,398
- I know her!
- No, get out of here.

255
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,600
- She's lying.
- Get out of here.

256
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,200
Guys, I know her!

257
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,679
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine, thank you.

258
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,678
<i>- The two of us, we're done.
- My love...</i>

259
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:45,678
<i>You did okay,
but you pushed it too far.</i>

260
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:48,199
<i>What's your problem?
Come on, go and catch Regina!</i>

261
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,200
<i>Try to reason with her.
Give me the car keys.</i>

262
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,999
I must talk with priest Pain.

263
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Tarain! Do you hear me? Tarain!

264
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:55,599
It's Tarain!

265
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,278
<i>With an "ain", as in "train".
Well, as in "nain".</i>

266
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:00,518
<i>- No, as in "pain".
- Yeah, whatever.</i>

267
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,398
<i>I can't wait to hear you out
on this one.</i>

268
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:05,240
Wait, play it one more time.

269
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,639
Tarain! Do you hear me? Tarain!

270
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,919
With an "ain", as in "train"!

271
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,999
<i>Well, as in "nain".
No, as in "pain".</i>

272
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,679
Yeah, whatever.

273
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,799
Is it your Dad?

274
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:18,279
Yeah.

275
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:58,799
What's up?

276
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,759
- Long time no see!
- Yeah...

277
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,278
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

278
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:04,279
Are you sure?

279
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,240
- Yes, yes.
- Did you see that?

280
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:09,000
The ocean in Montmartre.

281
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,520
There's no reason
to leave this place anymore.

282
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,639
I think I'll go.

283
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,519
Don't you wanna grab a drink?

284
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:18,639
No.

285
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,160
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

286
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,358
See you around then!

287
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:23,359
Yeah.

288
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,759
- Hi!
- Hello!

289
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:49,758
Do you know where this is?
The Grand Hotel de Clermont!

290
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:51,039
Yes, it is here.

291
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:01,440
- What's your name?
- Elliott... Eliza.

292
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:08,278
Are you kidding me?

293
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:12,559
The reservation said charming hotel
in the centre of Montmartre...

294
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,559
Room number 5. First floor.

295
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,680
What are we drinking?

296
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,318
Are you mute?
What are we drinking?

297
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:29,160
Sorry, I was somewhere else.

298
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:32,440
I just learned I'm a father.

299
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,319
Congratulations.

300
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,159
Yeah...

301
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,720
- This calls for a celebration.
- Yes.

302
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,599
It's on me.

303
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,240
Made a choice?

304
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,039
Calvados.

305
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,799
- Is it your first one?
- Well, I don't day drink.

306
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,480
The child.

307
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,279
- Oh, yes, it's the first one.
- Happy times.

308
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,960
Is this a boy or a girl?

309
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:02,480
It's a little girl.

310
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,640
But she's 3 years old.

311
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:09,799
One second. Yes?

312
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:14,000
I've just seen your missed calls.
What is it?

313
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:17,879
Can I see you?
We need to talk.

314
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,159
- No way. Tell me now.
- I want to see you in person.

315
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,920
Can I sleep by, tonight?
Just one night.

316
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,999
Really? 24 hours later, already?

317
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,518
I've just seen Salomé,
she wanted me dead.

318
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,159
I got my belongings stolen
by some tramps.

319
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:33,399
What? I don't get a thing.

320
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,999
<i>This is not important. She told
me something. We need to talk.</i>

321
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,799
Pierre, what are you doing?

322
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,318
I'm coming, sweetie.

323
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,518
You're wasted.

324
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:45,639
I can smell Calvados from a mile away.
Pull yourself together!

325
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,798
Ammad called some rounds
on what I'm about to tell you,

326
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:49,919
if you're coming.

327
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,679
No way, Camille could give birth
anytime now. This is ridiculous.

328
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,239
I'm a father-to-be too.

329
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,759
You're pissing me off.

330
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,319
I'm coming, sweetie.

331
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:01,079
Are you okay?

332
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,960
I've been better.

333
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,720
What is it?

334
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:10,399
As usual: money, accommodation...

335
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,719
Nothing new, but it got worse.

336
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,959
And I've just learned
I have a little girl,

337
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,119
but her mother hates me
and doesn't want to see me again.

338
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:20,159
Is that all?

339
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,880
No, some guys stole all my belongings.

340
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:26,519
Wait.

341
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,839
It's okay,
but it's getting tough.

342
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,039
- I'm in a struggle.
- I'll give you some more.

343
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:35,359
I got a room I cannot rent.

344
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:37,079
It's under renovation.

345
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,799
You'll go there
and gather yourself.

346
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,079
I'm sure you'll find something
for your little girl.

347
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:46,960
Why does the mother hate you?

348
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,680
Because I disappeared
from her life overnight.

349
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,079
- Smart move, right there.
- Yeah...

350
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,278
You'll have to prove yourself smarter
for the comeback.

351
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:58,679
What do you mean?

352
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,279
You have to go all out.

353
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,199
The day I met Françoise,
she was engaged to a private.

354
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,518
Still, she left him for me.

355
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:09,559
How did you pull this off?

356
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,639
It's been weeks and weeks
of saving money.

357
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,200
Then, I rented a car
and brought her to Deauville.

358
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:19,239
It won't work out, with her.

359
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,999
My daughter works
at the Moulin Rouge.

360
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,879
She's got invitations,
from time to time.

361
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,719
No, no...

362
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,480
- Thank you, Didier.
- Come on.

363
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,838
Then, you bring her to the pizza.
We can keep the kid.

364
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:31,598
- Thank you, but I'm fine.
- Or...

365
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:33,758
Think of a great gift.
Perfume, for example.

366
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:36,400
I can get you some Chanel.
It's yours for 20 bucks!

367
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,439
You're sweet.

368
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,240
You know what?
I'll think about it.

369
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,078
I'll manage,
I'll get around this.

370
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:45,480
You'll die for some cheap Chanel.

371
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,119
- Didier, still got your truck?
- Yeah.

372
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:28,519
Move!

373
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:30,558
Move your truck, dammit!

374
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,759
I can't block them forever.
Did you write the number?

375
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,240
CALL ME

376
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,880
Move, already!

377
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,920
- Move!
- Yeah, got it.

378
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,359
By the way, hi!

379
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:13,880
Door code: 21b78
Come meet the kid tonight. Not too late

380
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:17,559
PS: Asshole

381
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,920
Stop the music, please.

382
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,959
You can't play without permission.

383
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,118
Alright, I'll pack my stuff.
I didn't know,

384
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,239
I'm sorry.

385
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,480
Papers, please.

386
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,278
You won't believe it,
but my wallet got stolen

387
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,278
in this bar, last night.

388
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,319
I was waiting for them to open,
in case they had found anything.

389
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,118
Look... Exceptionally, we'll get a fine
sent to your address.

390
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:05,680
Great.
So... Ivo Livi.

391
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:09,359
L.I.V.I.

392
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,759
8 alley Yves Montand.

393
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,839
Paris, 18th.

394
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:18,558
- There you go.
- Thank you.

395
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,679
You'll receive the fine
within 72 hours.

396
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,118
- Okay.
- About your wallet...

397
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:24,839
If you don't find it at the bar,
you should go to the police station.

398
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,799
Good idea, thank you.
Thank you for your kindness.

399
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,759
- Have a good day.
- Thank you, good luck.

400
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,279
Casino

401
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,480
Thank you, goodbye.

402
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,480
Great.

403
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,799
- Goodbye!
- Thank you, see you soon.

404
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,399
It's from a vineyard, in the Jura.
They got about... 2 hectares.

405
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,880
Really, it's excellent.

406
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:41,440
I'll take it, then.

407
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,999
Good.

408
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,599
You'll see, this wine...

409
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,079
It's silky,

410
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,880
ethereal...

411
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,920
floral, too, you'll see.

412
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,480
It'll be 75 euros, please.

413
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,240
It's got to be excellent, then.

414
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:01,039
Thank you!

415
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:29,519
Hi.

416
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,799
You brought your girl.

417
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,240
Louise? Come say hi.

418
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,679
So, here is César.

419
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,759
- Hi!
- He's an old friend of Mom's.

420
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,880
What's up?

421
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,279
Louise, right?

422
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:51,880
Such a sweet name.

423
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,920
Are these for me
or are you out, tonight?

424
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,799
These are for you.

425
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,559
Why did you bring wine?

426
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:01,799
For dinner.

427
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
What dinner?

428
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,440
Come inside.

429
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,960
It's a good thing you repainted.
It looks nice.

430
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,680
This apartment is great.

431
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:23,038
It's lovely.

432
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,039
I mean...

433
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,920
It changes everything
while not really...

434
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,839
It's a nice apartment, really.

435
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:39,160
- How big is it?
- Stop it right there.

436
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,680
Alright.

437
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,039
I see Mrs. Louise
is drawing nice stuff.

438
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,799
I brought you a new friend.

439
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:53,480
His name is Teddy. Hi!

440
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:57,440
You don't like him, do you?

441
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,159
We'll get your teeth brushed.
Say good night to César.

442
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,039
- Good night.
- Bye-bye.

443
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,680
Let's get those teeth brushed.

444
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:25,279
Call me in 10 minutes
to tell me Camille is in labor

445
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:02,278
"All the people from the village
seemed so carefree

446
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:05,639
that nobody could imagine
how anxious they were,

447
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,960
after nightfall.

448
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:10,719
Mommy!
This is so embarrassing, Mom."

449
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,119
This guy's like me.
He sounds like me.

450
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:16,519
Do you want César
to do the monster?

451
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,359
- Yes.
- He knows a lot about monsters.

452
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:21,319
Yeah?

453
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:24,239
What am I supposed to do?

454
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,318
"The whole village was actually
terrified by the idea

455
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:30,278
that Scarifon, the child-eater

456
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:32,078
could show up any day.

457
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:34,518
All of them ignored
that in the utmost discretion,

458
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:37,039
a secret operation
was in the works.

459
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:42,038
The mayor's 4 daughters
were about to defy the night

460
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:43,160
in order to find Scarifon

461
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:46,639
and finally rid the village

462
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,200
of this terror.

463
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,079
And the 4 of them go..."

464
00:30:58,039 --> 00:30:59,599
Doesn't she ask questions?

465
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,279
She's too young.

466
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,240
Surely, she'll get there
in a year or two.

467
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:07,920
And what will you tell her?

468
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I'll tell the truth.

469
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:14,078
That you didn't know
where her father was?

470
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:15,079
No.

471
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:17,758
I'll tell her that one night,
he got invited,

472
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:19,278
that I slit his throat,

473
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,038
then I managed to dissolve his corpse
in the bathtub...

474
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:24,920
but that she must keep it secret,
or Mom will go to prison.

475
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,639
You don't have a bathtub.

476
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,759
You didn't see it.

477
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,960
I added one.

478
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:35,279
Still playing?

479
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,599
No, I dropped it.

480
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:46,719
Weren't you supposed
to meet with record labels?

481
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,559
Well, I didn't...

482
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,720
I've never sent this one.

483
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,160
Then, what do you do?

484
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,319
Well, I...

485
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,720
I made some money, in New York.

486
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,319
It was cool. And...

487
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,960
At some point, I got bored.
I wanted to come back, because...

488
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:10,079
Because I was missing Paris.

489
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,758
Are you not working?

490
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:13,799
Yes, I do.

491
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,400
I do, I do.

492
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:18,519
I work in a bar.

493
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,559
As a waiter?

494
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,079
No, as a manager.

495
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,598
I took over a business.

496
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:27,759
Natural wines.

497
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:30,519
You see, this is ours.
This is...

498
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:34,119
We only work with small vineyards.

499
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,919
This one's from Alsace.

500
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,838
He's only got half a hectare,
yet his wine is...

501
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:41,559
very soft, very...

502
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,199
vegetal, vainglorious...

503
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,240
Any chance you'd need a waitress?

504
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:50,078
Are you tired
with driving trains?

505
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:52,758
No, this is for a friend
who's in a financial struggle.

506
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:54,598
She's out for extras,
in restaurants.

507
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:55,839
She's great.

508
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,199
Well, yeah.

509
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,758
I'm there on a daily basis,
and we're currently recruiting.

510
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:01,278
Connect me with her.

511
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,799
I see her tomorrow.
We can swing by, at the bar.

512
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:07,399
Well, tomorrow,
I won't be there, unfortunately.

513
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,919
Then, maybe...

514
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,838
Aren't you there every day?

515
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:12,680
Well, yes, almost every day.

516
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,959
- Managing obliges me...
- You don't wanna help her.

517
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,518
Yes, I do.

518
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:18,960
I just have to figure...

519
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:22,558
We'll swing by on happy hours.

520
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:23,960
Can you give me the address?

521
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,399
I'll text you all of that.

522
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,559
What is it called?

523
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:31,400
It still goes
by the former owner's.

524
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,599
We're just done with the works,
so we want to come up...

525
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,920
with a nice, good-sounding name.

526
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,599
I'm glad to see you.

527
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,279
Even though I hate you.

528
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,400
Me too.

529
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,160
You hate me too?

530
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:00,960
Aren't you answering?

531
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,079
I'll call back later.

532
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,280
Ringing again.

533
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:15,440
Well, this is my brother.
He'll want to grab a drink.

534
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:18,480
You should get it.
He may be in trouble.

535
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,039
I don't think so.

536
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,759
Hello?

537
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,078
- Hello?
- Are you okay?

538
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,960
Not really,
Camille started the labor.

539
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,280
Oh, great. How is it going?

540
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:33,079
It's terrible, I'm panicking.
I don't know what to do.

541
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,919
- Please come.
- Come on...

542
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,760
Don't worry, it'll go well.

543
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,198
No, I'm not doing well.

544
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,038
I wanna die,
don't leave me alone.

545
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:42,518
I'm sure you'll manage.

546
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:44,319
I don't want Camille
to see that I can't manage.

547
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,999
Look, it'll be okay.

548
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,558
<i>Throw some water on your face
and get back to her.</i>

549
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:51,919
<i>If you're not feeling any better,
I'll come by.</i>

550
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,079
Just call me.
I can't talk to you right now.

551
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,960
Okay, I'll call you back.

552
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,679
- Is he alright?
- Look...

553
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,238
He's used to overreacting.
I'll call him in a moment.

554
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:04,518
Are you listening to yourself?

555
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:08,118
Your brother is about to welcome
his child, you have to go.

556
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:10,879
We'll finish what we were doing
and if it doesn't get better,

557
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,399
he'll call and I'll go there.

558
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,038
Listen, we'll catch up tomorrow.
Either way...

559
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:16,518
Go, go.

560
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:17,639
He needs you.

561
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,718
I'm truly sorry. Really.

562
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:24,320
Don't worry, you get used
to be abandoned pretty quickly.

563
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,799
Hello?

564
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,479
Why did you insist that much?
You call me 3 hours after my text.

565
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,479
I told you it'll be fine,
yet you made a fuss about it.

566
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,759
You're such a pain.

567
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,480
Camille is in labor.

568
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:50,840
Oh, really? Shit, sorry.
I'm on my way.

569
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,678
- What are you doing here?
- She wanted me out.

570
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:11,799
I was setting a bad vibe.

571
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,799
Chill, you're just having
an anxiety attack.

572
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,479
Each contraction kills me.

573
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,719
Take a long breath,
you'll be okay.

574
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,760
You got new shoes?

575
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,880
I'll tell you about that later.

576
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,360
Come on,
you can't leave her alone.

577
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:30,198
Forget it. She'll kill me.
You have to go.

578
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:31,718
- Nonsense.
- Yes, you have to!

579
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:34,319
You'll tell Camille
I'm thinking about her.

580
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,118
I'm not going to watch your wife
giving birth to your child!

581
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:41,118
You've spent your whole life under stress
and you still hang around, carefree.

582
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,718
You're the right man for the job.
Go in there, please.

583
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:46,198
- I'll do anything in return.
- No.

584
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:49,118
You just knock,
poke your head in

585
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,959
and say reassuring stuff,
like you are used to,

586
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,319
"Pierre flared up a little,

587
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,118
but he loves you
and is with you by thought."

588
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:57,199
Are you nuts?

589
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,679
- César, do it for me.
- No.

590
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:02,198
No.

591
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:03,440
- Come on.
- No.

592
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:05,760
Come on.

593
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,360
- Alright.
- Thank you.

594
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:18,800
What are you doing here?

595
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:20,800
I'm coming in peace.

596
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,079
And I have a message from Pierre...

597
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,479
Good, Camille, good.

598
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,800
It's coming. Come have a touch.

599
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,078
Tell me and go to hell.
Where's Pierre?

600
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:39,238
He called me, he had a flare up.

601
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:42,079
He'll come back soon.
He's with you, kind of.

602
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:45,759
- You'll be fine.
- Contractions again.

603
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,518
- Now, I want quality breathing.
- Keep on breathing.

604
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:49,960
Now, let's do the "om".

605
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:00,879
Good, I see the hair!

606
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,718
You've been saying that
for 2 hours, now!

607
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:06,879
- Are you sure it's the hair?
- I know it's tough.

608
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,359
I can't make it.
Take me to the hospital.

609
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,279
- I want this to stop.
- No, you're doing great.

610
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,479
- Come on, I see lots of hairs!
- Go have a look.

611
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,118
- I want you to have a check.
- I won't...

612
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:20,079
I'm serious! Tell me if this is hair
or if these are my hairs.

613
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:24,959
I'll take a picture without looking
and I'll let you check for yourself.

614
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,960
Come on.

615
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,519
I see the head!

616
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:42,960
I'll let you get some rest.

617
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:47,280
Bye, brother.
I'll call you tomorrow.

618
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,480
Congratulations.

619
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,880
Thank you.

620
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,199
You're welcome. Bye.

621
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,320
- Do you mind if...
- Go on.

622
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:27,639
<i>I'm currently away.
Leave a message.</i>

623
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:32,119
Dad, it's me.
I hope you're doing well.

624
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,079
I was calling to tell you
that Camille gave birth, tonight.

625
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:39,718
You should leave a message
for Pierre after mine.

626
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:41,119
I think he'll be glad.

627
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:43,840
I hope you're okay. Bye.

628
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:40,639
Hi police!

629
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:51,920
Hey, brother, what's up?

630
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:55,880
You're welcome.
I was glad to be part of it.

631
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,440
Yeah.

632
00:41:58,039 --> 00:42:00,920
You told me you would do anything
for me, yesterday, right?

633
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:03,159
Yes, you did say that.

634
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,238
I need you to call Axelle.

635
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:10,238
I think you got the catch,
with the kitchen.

636
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:12,638
Now, focus.
I'll go very fast.

637
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:14,078
Those coming to knock one back,

638
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:16,198
stick them to the bar
with a plate of salami.

639
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:19,238
In front of the slate,
you get the drill, right?

640
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:21,759
And those who want
to down a bottle,

641
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,158
I want them at the tables.
And you send them to me.

642
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:25,879
- Alright.
- Understood?

643
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,800
In case you have a doubt
on the wines, you can...

644
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:30,919
ask me, very good.

645
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,759
You're familiar with wines, right?

646
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,480
- Yes, of course.
- Great.

647
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:38,518
And keep your fingers
away from the slicer.

648
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:40,718
We can't go to the hospital.
We're busy, tonight.

649
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:43,718
I think you're good to go.
Let me see you in action, now.

650
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:46,038
- Alright, let's go.
- Alright.

651
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:48,118
- Good evening.
- I'm on it.

652
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:51,599
How are you doing, guys?
Can I set you up on the terrace?

653
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:55,639
White wine for starters, guys?
César, 2 glasses of Chablis.

654
00:42:57,159 --> 00:42:58,760
2 glasses of Chablis...

655
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:05,559
This good old fine Chablis.

656
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,638
The glasses are on their way.

657
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:13,919
Along with a salami plate
on the side.

658
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,879
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

659
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,159
- It'll be a table for two and...
- Hi.

660
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:22,238
We didn't book a table, though.

661
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,999
No problem, I'll get you one.

662
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,598
My friend, Diass.

663
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,638
- Hi.
- Diass, nice to meet you.

664
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:29,598
- I'll set you up outside.
- There?

665
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:30,920
- Yeah.
- Perfect.

666
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:34,880
- Are you comfortable?
- It's great.

667
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:37,800
These are on me.

668
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,360
Thank you.

669
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:41,559
Sorry.

670
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,959
Isn't this place lovely?

671
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,078
We've done a whole makeover.

672
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:49,598
The difference is huge.
Before, it was plagued with rats

673
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,719
and filled with winos drinking Calvados.

674
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,598
Are you familiar with grape juice?

675
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,999
I'm far from being an expert.

676
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,360
Aeration on this one
is on the strong side.

677
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:03,399
- I'll get them replaced.
- I'm good.

678
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,320
I love that.
It's reminiscent of the Jura.

679
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:06,959
Exactly.

680
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,639
We're right in the Jura.

681
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,879
- Such a...
- Connoisseur.

682
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,839
Connoisseur! This is great.

683
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,518
Actually, your knowledge
is welcome, here.

684
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:18,919
With Axelle, it was a tough drive,
in the beginning.

685
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:21,840
She has no background,
in food service.

686
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,038
She started out on markets
and fishmongers, you know...

687
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:27,038
She's really nice, easy-going...

688
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:28,359
Are you comfortable?

689
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,479
Chewing the fat with our clients?

690
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,558
Hi!

691
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:32,959
- Good evening.
- Pleased to meet you.

692
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,399
- We were talking about you.
- About what?

693
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,319
- Good things only.
- Great.

694
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,279
Are you not hungry, girls?

695
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,638
With this guy comfortably seated,
while he should work,

696
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:43,960
you guys might be starving.

697
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:47,039
- Aren't you?
- Fishmongering calls upon me.

698
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,759
Now, menus.

699
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,999
Get this one clean
and bring a slab of charcuterie.

700
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,680
Keep your fingers away from the slicer.
We can't go to the hospital.

701
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,159
- Cheers.
- Here's to us.

702
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,718
How is it?
Having a good time?

703
00:45:23,719 --> 00:45:27,480
I am having a blast,
looking at you under command.

704
00:45:28,679 --> 00:45:30,199
I love her already.

705
00:45:31,159 --> 00:45:33,999
I told her she went
a little overboard, already.

706
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,638
It's not always easy,
with the staff.

707
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:38,399
Would you like a dessert?

708
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,239
We'll have 2 glasses of sparkling wine.

709
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,919
And 2 chocolate mousses.

710
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,999
2 glasses of sparkling wine,
2 chocolate mousses.

711
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,719
2 glasses of sparkling wine
and 2 chocolate mousses, please.

712
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,959
- The chocolate is...
- Did you blow a gasket?

713
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:55,879
Change your tone, already.
We're not selling fish, here.

714
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:59,319
You lower that knife.
We'll talk in the supply room.

715
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,959
Yeah, let's talk.

716
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,039
Oh, hell...

717
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:05,319
There it is, he's dead.

718
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,959
Did you blow a fuse?
What are you doing?

719
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,399
I'm sorry.

720
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,759
Sorry about what? The whole place
is crowded, are you nuts?

721
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,879
Look, I lied to you.

722
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:17,118
I'm nowhere to being familiar
with food service and wines.

723
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:19,679
- I got no interest in this.
- Then why are you here?

724
00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:22,479
Salomé is the love of my life.

725
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,678
We've barely just reconnected.
I wanted to look good.

726
00:46:24,679 --> 00:46:27,959
I had the terrible idea
to tell her I own a bar.

727
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,119
I thought I'd look good, if I...

728
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,559
told her I owned a bar.

729
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,079
Well, I...

730
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,000
3 years ago, I messed it all up.

731
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:41,960
As we were catching up, she told me
I was the father of her child.

732
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,238
So... I wanted to look good.

733
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:47,199
I told her I had a business.

734
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,919
Of course, she wanted to see.

735
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,999
As the loser that I am,
I couldn't tell her the truth.

736
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,558
I believed I could make something up
in two hours.

737
00:46:55,559 --> 00:46:56,599
And...

738
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:59,678
here we are.
I wanted to be crushing it.

739
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:01,638
I'm a failure.
I'll tell her everything.

740
00:47:01,639 --> 00:47:02,679
No, don't.

741
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:05,000
Come here, idiot.

742
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,199
Such drama... Alright.

743
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,760
Okay, look. You're not telling her.
You don't tell her a thing, okay?

744
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:13,839
You're Hugh Grant.

745
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,079
Only part-time.

746
00:47:15,559 --> 00:47:17,598
We'll take back Julia Roberts.

747
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,598
From now on, you're the boss.

748
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:22,039
- I can't do it.
- Come on, you can do it.

749
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,238
We'll take the check, please.

750
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:51,638
Look, it's on me.

751
00:47:51,639 --> 00:47:54,238
- This is adorable. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

752
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:56,558
One drink before you go.

753
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:58,440
I have to go, I'm exhausted.

754
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,919
Let me keep your number.
Axelle will give you a shot.

755
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,000
What do you mean?

756
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:07,519
Well, we're recruiting Diass.
She'll work on the weekends.

757
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:10,599
Oh, alright. It's great!

758
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:14,400
- Thank you so much.
- My pleasure.

759
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,480
- This is great.
- Well...

760
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,360
Are you staying?

761
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,039
Yeah, but it'll be one drink.

762
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,480
Be careful.
Good night, sweetheart.

763
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,518
Thank you again.
It was really nice.

764
00:48:27,519 --> 00:48:29,079
I really appreciate it,
thank you.

765
00:48:31,639 --> 00:48:34,198
Get yourself comfortable
while we get this done.

766
00:48:34,199 --> 00:48:36,718
- Come on, don't be shy.
- You're sweet.

767
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:38,000
Yeah, don't sweat it.

768
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,959
Have a drink with us, please.

769
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,320
I can't, boss.

770
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,719
Not a drop before I end my shift.

771
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,519
I've heard you used to work
on the market, before.

772
00:48:50,119 --> 00:48:51,280
- Yes.
- Yeah...

773
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:56,039
It's not a straw!

774
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,598
I was there, having my sister-in-law
delivering the baby

775
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:04,439
in a birthing pool,
which I didn't know existed.

776
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,920
This one I love.

777
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:12,158
- Come on the dancefloor.
- No, I'll look at you.

778
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:14,239
Move it, come on!

779
00:49:57,559 --> 00:49:58,559
Oh God.

780
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:01,119
It's extremely painful.

781
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,199
It's horribly painful.

782
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,799
I think it's on the verge
of a fracture.

783
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,519
It's the end of your life.
It's over.

784
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:13,840
I have internal bleeding.

785
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,439
Honestly, I don't understand

786
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,518
why you'd mess with a guy
as big as the dancefloor.

787
00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:24,400
Why would you dance with a guy
who looks like Sean Paul?

788
00:50:26,519 --> 00:50:28,078
- Stop it.
- Outch!

789
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:29,919
You're fine. Look, you're fine.

790
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:30,960
It really hurts.

791
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:36,000
This city is so absurd.

792
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,759
I read about Paris
before coming here.

793
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,159
I dreamt of seeing
the Eiffel Tower and Sacré-Cœur.

794
00:50:42,519 --> 00:50:45,880
But my favourite place...
is right here.

795
00:50:46,639 --> 00:50:48,639
Barbès Rochechouart.

796
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:53,840
I missed you.

797
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,119
I missed you too.

798
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:15,078
Why did you do that?
What's wrong?

799
00:51:15,079 --> 00:51:16,839
What's wrong?

800
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:17,840
It's...

801
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:22,800
I missed you so much
but I really want to hurt you.

802
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,078
- I'm sorry.
- "I'm sorry."

803
00:51:27,079 --> 00:51:30,279
What's the point of being sorry?
Why are we here, César?

804
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:31,359
What do you mean?

805
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,319
Why are you here? Why...

806
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,840
Why are we doing this?
Why did you come back?

807
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,079
Because I feel bad.

808
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:40,280
Ever since I left.

809
00:51:41,239 --> 00:51:43,759
I can't make it up to you
because I ruined it, but...

810
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,799
I want to be with you all the time,
every second.

811
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:47,880
Every second.

812
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:52,598
So, let's get a drink
at your place and you tell me

813
00:51:52,599 --> 00:51:54,439
everything you've done since.

814
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:55,638
We can't.

815
00:51:55,639 --> 00:51:57,840
Don't tell me you live with someone.

816
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,360
No, I don't live with anyone.

817
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:08,678
No, I'm sleeping on my friend's couch
because I'm in trouble.

818
00:52:08,679 --> 00:52:11,879
Didn't you tell me
that you bought an apartment?

819
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:15,880
Yes, but it's under construction,
there's plaster everywhere, it's a mess.

820
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,479
There's a guy... Come. Come.

821
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,718
- You're scared of him?
- Yes, he's big and dangerous.

822
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:24,479
- He's scared of me.
- Of course, I'm scared.

823
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,118
It's kind of crazy.

824
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:28,840
We randomly run into each other...

825
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,840
the night he lost his keys.

826
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,000
We've never been close as cousins.

827
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:41,038
Never, but well... as a family,
we help each other out.

828
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:42,119
It's normal.

829
00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:45,639
Okay, Miss,
would you mind if I go home?

830
00:52:46,199 --> 00:52:47,400
I'm a little tired.

831
00:52:49,159 --> 00:52:51,960
Sorry. Sorry. Go on.

832
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:55,198
Get home safe.
I'll call you tomorrow.

833
00:52:55,199 --> 00:52:57,319
- Okay, no problem.
- Get home safe.

834
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:58,400
- Bye.
- Ciao.

835
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:02,960
You think she believed me?

836
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:05,719
Shoes.

837
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,999
I think she was able
to take a long nap

838
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,760
while you explained
because it took so long.

839
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:14,718
"It's crazy, lost in the middle
of the street..."

840
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:15,999
Stop.

841
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,078
- "He lost his keys."
- Stop.

842
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:20,320
"He's my cousin.
It's unbelievable."

843
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,118
You're such a bad liar.

844
00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:24,440
We can't all be as good as you.

845
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:43,119
Loulou?

846
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:45,840
She's sleeping.

847
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:04,400
Oh my God.

848
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:07,919
Hi, sweetie.
How are you?

849
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:08,920
How are you?

850
00:54:10,199 --> 00:54:12,198
I'm late. I'm late!
Fuck.

851
00:54:12,199 --> 00:54:14,319
I have to get ready,
can you go down with her?

852
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:17,198
- Yeah, yeah.
- You want breakfast?

853
00:54:17,199 --> 00:54:18,480
Yeah, huh...

854
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:23,280
There's milk in the fridge,
there's chocolate powder.

855
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,238
- Third drawer to the left.
- Okay.

856
00:54:26,239 --> 00:54:27,639
What do you like?

857
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,238
- Toast with butter.
- Toast with butter.

858
00:54:32,239 --> 00:54:33,999
Shall we make hot chocolate?

859
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,519
Small cubes, medium cubes
or big cubes?

860
00:54:38,039 --> 00:54:40,799
- Tiny triangles.
- Oh, God.

861
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,399
With jam or...
A little bit of jam?

862
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,158
A lot of jam.

863
00:54:45,159 --> 00:54:46,760
With a lot of blueberry jam.

864
00:54:47,679 --> 00:54:49,038
Do you have other kids?

865
00:54:49,039 --> 00:54:50,879
It's like you've done this
your whole life.

866
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,238
Yes, I have many.

867
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:55,279
In Mexico, one in Moscow,
New York...

868
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:58,159
We can have a Christmas party
with all of my kids.

869
00:54:58,599 --> 00:55:00,679
What are you doing tonight?
I'm free.

870
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:04,399
I can pick her up

871
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,239
and I'll meet you at your place?

872
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:09,639
You can show us around
the palace.

873
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:13,519
Awesome.

874
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,999
So, around 6:30?

875
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,718
I have to hurry. I'm late!

876
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:19,799
Hurry up.

877
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,879
Then people think train agents
are-always late.

878
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:23,719
She has to hurry.
Let's tell her.

879
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:32,198
You ate, you're changed,
what more can I do for you?

880
00:55:32,199 --> 00:55:33,880
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

881
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,959
Shit, it's work. It's work.

882
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,118
Don't answer, it's the weekend
and you're on paternity leave.

883
00:55:40,119 --> 00:55:43,119
Yeah, exactly. It's important.
Hello?

884
00:55:46,119 --> 00:55:47,239
No, forget it.

885
00:55:48,159 --> 00:55:49,800
No, no, no, I'm not doing that.

886
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:52,079
No, I'm not giving you the keys.

887
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,198
I don't want your shoes. I don't care!

888
00:55:55,199 --> 00:55:56,400
Are you kidding me?

889
00:55:59,639 --> 00:56:01,599
Honey, I have to go to work.

890
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:04,518
Tell them they can't do that,
you're not going.

891
00:56:04,519 --> 00:56:07,078
They need me,
they can't unlock a computer...

892
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:09,078
They can't pressure you
during your break.

893
00:56:09,079 --> 00:56:12,199
They need me, they can't do it.
We'll lose a big deal.

894
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:14,559
It's 30 minutes max by scooter.
It's alright.

895
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,000
See you.

896
00:56:19,639 --> 00:56:20,880
That's crazy.

897
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,919
However, the day she finds out
you're homeless, she'll beat you up.

898
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:29,840
Everything lines up great.
I'll find a solution.

899
00:56:31,239 --> 00:56:32,239
Here they are.

900
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,558
Don't mess up Antoine's place.
It's worth a lot.

901
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,839
800K for his stupid loft.

902
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,319
Don't break anything.

903
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:40,519
I take a stroll with Salomé
and I give you back the keys.

904
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,919
You look weird.
Everything okay?

905
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:46,960
No, it's not.

906
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:49,518
I don't know why
but my son hates me.

907
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:51,759
He can't wait to strangle me.

908
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,439
- He's a psychopath.
- Come on.

909
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:54,919
I see it, I'm useless.

910
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:57,518
He doesn't need me.
I feel useless.

911
00:56:57,519 --> 00:57:01,000
They're together and I'm here,
looking like an idiot. It's hell.

912
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:04,359
I have to go, Camille already thinks
I'm screwing things up

913
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,079
so if I'm not on time...

914
00:57:08,519 --> 00:57:12,920
On your right, Place des Abbesses,
and an illustrious local musician.

915
00:57:25,199 --> 00:57:27,119
It's going way better at your house.

916
00:57:28,199 --> 00:57:30,799
Can't we do a family thing?
It'd be great.

917
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,598
We kill our wives and kids,
stash them under the deck

918
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:34,879
and disappear together?

919
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:37,000
No, like a dinner.
A family thing.

920
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,999
I talked to Dad,
he called me for the birth.

921
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,238
It was nice.

922
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:44,359
Oh, he called you? Cool.

923
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:45,759
- Okay, I'm going.
- We'll see.

924
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:46,999
- Bye.
- Thank you.

925
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
You're welcome.

926
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:52,119
This will be my office.

927
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:59,479
An office with your head in the clouds
with the glass roof and all.

928
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,639
It'll be great.

929
00:58:01,039 --> 00:58:05,119
And over here,
I'll put a large bookcase.

930
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:06,879
A bookcase?

931
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,039
I'll let you discover my bedroom.

932
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,518
- It's awesome.
- It'll be great.

933
00:58:12,519 --> 00:58:14,960
Me and Louise will be good here.

934
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:18,119
And you?
Where will you be staying?

935
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,559
Well... Here.

936
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:27,519
I thought you stopped playing.

937
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:31,038
No, I did. I stopped.

938
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:34,518
I brought it for my brother,
he wants to get into music.

939
00:58:34,519 --> 00:58:36,839
He wants to play string instruments,
it's super hard,

940
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:39,400
so I told him to start
with a keyboard because...

941
00:58:40,039 --> 00:58:43,078
The notes are in tune.
I'm lending him mine. I don't mind.

942
00:58:43,079 --> 00:58:44,239
Since I stopped.

943
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,159
You're still such a bad liar.

944
00:58:48,039 --> 00:58:49,118
I'm not lying.

945
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:50,840
- You're not lying?
- No.

946
00:58:51,239 --> 00:58:54,039
But we know you hide things from me, no?

947
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,360
No, I hid things,
but I'm not hiding anything.

948
00:58:58,239 --> 00:59:00,158
You tell the truth
and only the truth.

949
00:59:00,159 --> 00:59:01,719
- Only the truth.
- Sure.

950
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:05,558
I think not giving up on your dreams
is great.

951
00:59:05,559 --> 00:59:08,198
So many people miss out on their lives.

952
00:59:08,199 --> 00:59:09,199
You're right.

953
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,920
So, can we hear your new songs?

954
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:15,999
I don't have new songs.

955
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,158
Because... I stopped playing,

956
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:19,678
so I have old songs.

957
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:21,558
Okay, can we hear your old songs?

958
00:59:21,559 --> 00:59:24,919
Loulou hasn't heard them,
I'm sure she'll love them.

959
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,239
Right, Lou... Lou!

960
00:59:26,639 --> 00:59:27,639
Oh, dear.

961
00:59:28,119 --> 00:59:30,078
We're on the serial killer path.

962
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:32,440
Put this down, it's very dangerous.

963
00:59:33,519 --> 00:59:35,119
It's very dangerous.

964
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:40,118
I'm going to have to leave you, guys.

965
00:59:40,119 --> 00:59:43,159
An extra didn't show up
and I have to replace her.

966
00:59:43,639 --> 00:59:45,399
She's exhausted as well.

967
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:46,919
We'll meet up later?

968
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,079
Yeah.

969
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:49,880
We're leaving too.

970
00:59:52,599 --> 00:59:55,280
I really don't know
how to get myself out of this.

971
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:56,880
It's hell.

972
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,518
You'll figure it out.
You always do.

973
00:59:59,519 --> 01:00:01,198
I do because I love fleeing.

974
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:03,919
I flee shitty situations,
but this one, I love it.

975
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,599
I'm good with her and the kid,
I've never felt this good.

976
01:00:07,239 --> 01:00:09,678
In every family,
there are stories like:

977
01:00:09,679 --> 01:00:11,159
"Grandpa was a war hero."

978
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:13,919
But telling the truth is good too,
you know.

979
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,718
If I tell the truth,
I lose her forever.

980
01:00:15,719 --> 01:00:17,480
Stop whining. Here.

981
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,480
You take the car
and bring her to Deauville.

982
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,480
Enough with Deauville.

983
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,559
Going out of town
will do you good.

984
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:30,760
Thanks, buddy.

985
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,079
Fuck...

986
01:00:40,119 --> 01:00:41,119
It's horrible.

987
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,159
He just fell asleep.

988
01:00:45,639 --> 01:00:47,198
You want a pick-me-up?

989
01:00:47,199 --> 01:00:50,119
No, I can't smell like booze,
I'll get scolded.

990
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:53,960
I don't know, green tea?

991
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,359
Well, you boys have changed.

992
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,638
I'm sorry, I'm leaving.

993
01:01:00,639 --> 01:01:01,718
You sweat too much.

994
01:01:01,719 --> 01:01:02,719
See you, buddy.

995
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:04,320
Bye, César.

996
01:01:27,719 --> 01:01:29,400
- Shoes?
- Don't bother.

997
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,199
- Mommy?
- Yes?

998
01:01:35,559 --> 01:01:37,679
- Kisses.
- I'm coming.

999
01:01:41,159 --> 01:01:42,320
César, kisses.

1000
01:01:51,719 --> 01:01:53,598
Damn, you look cool.

1001
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:56,118
We're going to the sitter's.

1002
01:01:56,119 --> 01:01:58,319
We're going to the sitter's!

1003
01:01:58,320 --> 01:01:59,400
Oh, no, wait.

1004
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:03,880
Now, that's better.

1005
01:02:49,079 --> 01:02:51,118
Open your arms and turn.

1006
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:52,639
There you go!

1007
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,038
Ouch.

1008
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:06,159
You hurt your knee?

1009
01:03:07,559 --> 01:03:10,118
Shall we go to bed or what?
We sleep or not?

1010
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,280
We're going to bed?

1011
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:24,199
Get up.

1012
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:27,920
- What time is it?
- 10:30.

1013
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:32,518
Get your things and Louisette's,
I'm taking you on a trip.

1014
01:03:32,519 --> 01:03:33,919
Where are we going?

1015
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,239
It's a surprise.

1016
01:03:36,719 --> 01:03:37,959
For how long?

1017
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:39,320
Not long, you'll see.

1018
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,999
I work tomorrow,
I can't leave like that.

1019
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,119
Yes, you can, it's a surprise.
Come on.

1020
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,440
Get up.

1021
01:03:54,519 --> 01:03:56,999
You want me to make you some tea?

1022
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,118
Yes.

1023
01:03:58,119 --> 01:03:59,598
Do you trust me?

1024
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:00,599
No.

1025
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:04,718
Come on, ladies,
are you ready back there?

1026
01:04:04,719 --> 01:04:06,880
- Whose car is this?
- I stole it.

1027
01:04:07,239 --> 01:04:08,320
Yeah, sure.

1028
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,118
It's my buddy's.

1029
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:13,239
Let's hurry.

1030
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:26,559
Where are we?

1031
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:29,039
You wanted to do
a road-trip in France.

1032
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:44,158
We could go
to Arles Amphitheatre next.

1033
01:04:44,159 --> 01:04:46,558
Arles Amphitheatre?
It's really far.

1034
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:49,279
- But it's here.
- No, we're far from it.

1035
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:51,599
We could take a break in Lascaux.

1036
01:04:52,119 --> 01:04:54,320
And there's Chambord right next to it.

1037
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:55,840
What's that?

1038
01:04:55,841 --> 01:04:58,038
It's Chambord.
I'm telling you, it's good.

1039
01:04:58,039 --> 01:04:59,118
Hello?

1040
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:00,519
Bro, it's awful.

1041
01:05:01,559 --> 01:05:03,518
Camille and Sasha hate me,
I can't anymore.

1042
01:05:03,519 --> 01:05:04,839
I need to see other people.

1043
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:07,518
Can't we do a dinner
for your birthday on Sunday?

1044
01:05:07,519 --> 01:05:09,638
No, I hate family dinners.

1045
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:11,799
Every time we think we get along,
but we're just drunk.

1046
01:05:12,119 --> 01:05:15,719
We eat, we drink, we sing happy birthday.
It'll be good for everyone, please.

1047
01:05:16,119 --> 01:05:18,678
I'll ask Salomé but I doubt it.

1048
01:05:18,679 --> 01:05:20,000
I'll ask and let you know.

1049
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:21,880
Do we invite Dad?

1050
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:24,638
So that if we run out of things to say,
he'll tell us about his depression

1051
01:05:24,639 --> 01:05:26,159
and we can all shoot ourselves, great.

1052
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,678
- Pierre.
- I have to go. Hitler's calling.

1053
01:05:31,679 --> 01:05:32,999
Coming!

1054
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,238
It was my brother.

1055
01:05:34,239 --> 01:05:36,439
He wanted to get altogether
next Sunday for my birthday.

1056
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:38,240
But just us three is better,
I'll tell him no.

1057
01:05:38,639 --> 01:05:40,598
No, it's a good idea.

1058
01:05:40,599 --> 01:05:43,399
Let's just do lunch at home.

1059
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:46,158
Let's not complicate things.
Let's just get coffee after.

1060
01:05:46,159 --> 01:05:48,038
No, it's not complicated.

1061
01:05:48,039 --> 01:05:50,360
We do something simple
like a Sunday roast.

1062
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:52,679
Okay, okay.

1063
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,118
You don't feel like it?

1064
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:58,639
I don't like celebrating my birthday
and my family and all...

1065
01:05:59,639 --> 01:06:01,158
It's going to be great.

1066
01:06:01,159 --> 01:06:04,320
However, no slip-ups about...

1067
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,079
We'll tell her at the right time.

1068
01:06:10,159 --> 01:06:11,159
Come on, Loulou.

1069
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:14,920
Come, come.

1070
01:06:21,159 --> 01:06:23,719
We're invited for lunch Sunday
at Salomé's.

1071
01:06:24,599 --> 01:06:26,839
- We're going?
- Yeah, whatever.

1072
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:27,840
Okay.

1073
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:30,519
It's actually huge.
I didn't know.

1074
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,159
Apparently,
it's even bigger in real life.

1075
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:39,439
We still have time to go to Arles.

1076
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:40,440
To Arles?

1077
01:06:41,079 --> 01:06:42,118
Here.

1078
01:06:42,119 --> 01:06:43,880
So. Arles.

1079
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:45,519
We're here...

1080
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:48,079
- We're here.
- Yeah, well, look.

1081
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:50,000
We go by Arles,

1082
01:06:50,719 --> 01:06:52,360
and swing by Savoie.

1083
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,759
- And then we go.
- The poppy cries.

1084
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,158
The poppy cries?

1085
01:06:57,159 --> 01:06:58,719
We're going to see the village?

1086
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:00,400
Oh, gallop?

1087
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:07,840
We're catching up to Mommy!

1088
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:31,039
I didn't ask,
but does everybody eat everything?

1089
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,400
César?

1090
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:35,039
Hum, yeah, yeah.

1091
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:38,678
- You okay?
- Yes, why?

1092
01:07:38,679 --> 01:07:41,239
I don't know,
you look deep in thoughts.

1093
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:44,078
No, I just hope everything goes well.

1094
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:46,280
You know, my family is a bit... weird.

1095
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:54,360
We're your family.

1096
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:56,760
They're our guests,

1097
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:58,239
okay?

1098
01:07:58,679 --> 01:07:59,679
Let's go.

1099
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,479
Let's clean up a bit.

1100
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,559
- It's a mess.
- I can see that.

1101
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:07,078
- Hello.
- Happy birthday.

1102
01:08:07,079 --> 01:08:08,159
Thank you.

1103
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:14,078
- Bonjour. Camille.
- I'm Salomé.

1104
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:15,198
Nice to meet you.

1105
01:08:15,199 --> 01:08:16,359
Hey, you.

1106
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:19,318
- You remember Pierre?
- Yes, it's been a while.

1107
01:08:19,319 --> 01:08:21,000
- It's nice here.
- Thank you.

1108
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:24,078
Oh, shit, hey, Dad.
I didn't see you.

1109
01:08:24,079 --> 01:08:25,519
Why did you hide?

1110
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,118
I didn't hide,
what are you saying?

1111
01:08:27,119 --> 01:08:29,919
- Yes, you hid in the hallway.
- No, I just got here.

1112
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:31,479
- How are you?
- I'm good.

1113
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:33,999
- How is everybody?
- Good.

1114
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,039
Hello.

1115
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:37,519
Nice to meet you.

1116
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:38,720
Come in.

1117
01:08:41,319 --> 01:08:43,999
So he sleeps in the morning
and not at night?

1118
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,438
He sleeps all the time.

1119
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:47,358
Sasha's grown up so much.

1120
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:49,519
No, that's Louise. She's...

1121
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,879
She's my daughter. She's three.

1122
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:53,198
So, Dad...

1123
01:08:53,199 --> 01:08:55,039
Well, Salomé.

1124
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:57,559
Salomé, my dad, Pascal.

1125
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,799
And Louise, Salomé's daughter.

1126
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:01,359
What time is it, please?

1127
01:09:02,359 --> 01:09:05,158
It's one sharp.
Do you want me to take your coat?

1128
01:09:05,159 --> 01:09:06,159
No.

1129
01:09:08,119 --> 01:09:10,318
I like pomegranate,
but it's tricky to peel.

1130
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:12,759
She's sleeping like a log
and she didn't eat anything.

1131
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:15,720
She'll get up for the cake.
I know her.

1132
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:17,640
I can't stop myself.

1133
01:09:18,199 --> 01:09:20,238
- You okay, Dad?
- Yes, I'm okay.

1134
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:23,560
- Are you cold? Do you want a blanket?
- No, thank you, I'm good.

1135
01:09:26,039 --> 01:09:27,119
César.

1136
01:09:27,479 --> 01:09:29,000
Tell me. Tell me.

1137
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:32,159
Am I smiling right now or not?

1138
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,759
Well, no, not really.

1139
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:37,479
And now, am I smiling?

1140
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:38,960
Now, yes.

1141
01:09:40,279 --> 01:09:42,600
- And now?
- It's not really a smile.

1142
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:45,599
Come, come. It's your uncle.

1143
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,079
It's your uncle. Come here.

1144
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:49,680
Look at that.

1145
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:53,158
No way! That's crazy.

1146
01:09:53,159 --> 01:09:55,118
- The guy is...
- That was magnetism.

1147
01:09:55,119 --> 01:09:56,358
He's a wizard.

1148
01:09:56,359 --> 01:09:57,559
Pierre.

1149
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,279
Am I smiling or not now?

1150
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:00,679
No.

1151
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,158
On either side?

1152
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:03,359
No. None.

1153
01:10:04,039 --> 01:10:05,478
Not at all.

1154
01:10:05,479 --> 01:10:06,719
You okay?

1155
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:07,999
- Yes.
- What's wrong?

1156
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,599
Yes, Pascal, you seem a bit off
since you got here.

1157
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,880
Well, more off than usual.

1158
01:10:13,359 --> 01:10:14,799
- Yeah.
- What's wrong?

1159
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,680
No, I had a procedure done and...

1160
01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:19,880
I'm just worried it failed.

1161
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:22,039
Do you mean surgery?

1162
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:23,680
No, not really.

1163
01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:26,479
A small injection.
I wanted to...

1164
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:28,318
Erase my fine lines.

1165
01:10:28,319 --> 01:10:29,439
What?

1166
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,560
What? You got botox?

1167
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,119
Yeah...

1168
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,158
Right here?

1169
01:10:36,159 --> 01:10:38,358
No, not really. No, no.

1170
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:41,839
It's hyaluronic acid.
It's completely natural.

1171
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:44,359
- Seriously? But why?
- Why do this to yourself?

1172
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,600
Alexandra left me, I...

1173
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:48,999
I'm struggling.

1174
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,119
Oh, Dad.

1175
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:52,399
- Oh, Pascal.
- Why?

1176
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,199
I don't know why.
She told me that...

1177
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,439
She told me that she couldn't...

1178
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:02,078
She couldn't see herself with me.

1179
01:11:02,079 --> 01:11:03,319
I don't get it.

1180
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,000
Why?

1181
01:11:05,399 --> 01:11:07,359
Because she's 36, Dad.

1182
01:11:08,079 --> 01:11:09,119
Really?

1183
01:11:10,279 --> 01:11:13,158
When a woman who is
30 years younger than you,

1184
01:11:13,159 --> 01:11:15,759
even more,
says she can't see herself with you,

1185
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,679
your first thought is to get botox,
like an actress?

1186
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:19,278
That's harsh.

1187
01:11:19,279 --> 01:11:21,278
I'm going to hit him
if he keeps going.

1188
01:11:21,279 --> 01:11:22,720
Tell him to stop.

1189
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:24,600
Pierre, that's enough.

1190
01:11:25,119 --> 01:11:27,118
Okay, guys, stop.
You're harsh.

1191
01:11:27,119 --> 01:11:29,759
Breakups are horrible.

1192
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,399
- Yes, it's horrible.
- My poor Pascal.

1193
01:11:34,319 --> 01:11:35,719
- I'm devastated.
- Yes.

1194
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:38,759
It'll pass.
After five, six months, it passes.

1195
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,799
Will Nicole Kidman's mouth also pass?

1196
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,759
- Okay, enough.
- Stop!

1197
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:45,279
We can move on.
Find another subject.

1198
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:48,238
- Grandpa is sleeping.
- Yeah.

1199
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:49,239
Look.

1200
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:54,439
Happy birthday to you

1201
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:59,520
Happy birthday to you

1202
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:04,680
Happy birthday Dear César

1203
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:08,800
Happy birthday to you

1204
01:12:09,399 --> 01:12:11,038
Let's blow the candles together.

1205
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:13,038
One... two...

1206
01:12:13,039 --> 01:12:14,319
Two and half...

1207
01:12:15,159 --> 01:12:16,639
- Three.
- Three.

1208
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,239
One, two, three...

1209
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:25,078
I guess I'll open my gifts.

1210
01:12:25,079 --> 01:12:26,158
Yes, let's see.

1211
01:12:26,159 --> 01:12:27,879
A gift from my brother.

1212
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:29,720
I outdid myself this time.

1213
01:12:33,119 --> 01:12:34,119
The one and only.

1214
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:35,199
Beautiful.

1215
01:12:36,079 --> 01:12:38,438
This one is from Louise and me.

1216
01:12:38,439 --> 01:12:39,560
Oh, thank you.

1217
01:12:40,399 --> 01:12:41,679
Is it a cheque?

1218
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:43,158
If you want.

1219
01:12:43,159 --> 01:12:45,760
First, I'd like to thank you, Pascal,

1220
01:12:46,319 --> 01:12:49,679
for giving birth to this... asshole.

1221
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:52,720
I haven't been this happy
for a long time.

1222
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:55,118
So, thank you.

1223
01:12:55,119 --> 01:12:56,399
My pleasure.

1224
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:57,760
So...

1225
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:02,559
Louise and I don't think
you should give up music.

1226
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:06,519
So we made copies of your EP

1227
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,038
and we sent them to...

1228
01:13:08,039 --> 01:13:09,559
- How many, Loulou?
- 18.

1229
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:11,038
18 record labels.

1230
01:13:11,039 --> 01:13:13,399
And two of them
want to meet you.

1231
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:16,960
Congrats, that's great!

1232
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:21,599
Cool!
So... Oh, there it is.

1233
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:24,478
"Meeting with Asuna Music
Thursday, 2 pm."

1234
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:26,078
So, you're happy?

1235
01:13:26,079 --> 01:13:27,559
- Well I...
- Yeah?

1236
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:30,038
I don't know what to say.
I'm touched. Thank you.

1237
01:13:30,039 --> 01:13:33,358
We've been telling you
to send your songs for what, 15 years?

1238
01:13:33,359 --> 01:13:36,078
It's not like
you didn't have time to prepare...

1239
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:37,439
Let's make a toast.
To Loulou.

1240
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:40,078
Well done!
It's all thanks to you.

1241
01:13:40,079 --> 01:13:42,159
- Good job!
- To Loulou!

1242
01:13:46,359 --> 01:13:48,398
It was nice, wasn't it?
It went well.

1243
01:13:48,399 --> 01:13:49,680
Yeah, it was great.

1244
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:52,359
Are you okay?

1245
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:53,840
Yeah.

1246
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,839
You look like you did LSD
with your dad.

1247
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,199
No, I'm fine.

1248
01:14:01,399 --> 01:14:03,880
I'm just tired, I think.

1249
01:14:13,319 --> 01:14:14,839
I forgot to do something.

1250
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:18,399
I have to go give Axelle
the keys at the bar.

1251
01:14:19,039 --> 01:14:20,600
She doesn't have the keys?

1252
01:14:22,119 --> 01:14:25,359
We had a spare but we lost it.
I'll be quick. See you.

1253
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:27,680
César?

1254
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:20,880
Hello?

1255
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:24,600
Yeah...

1256
01:15:27,039 --> 01:15:28,119
Yeah, okay.

1257
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:32,278
Thanks for everything.

1258
01:15:32,279 --> 01:15:34,840
Yeah.
Is Françoise better?

1259
01:15:35,479 --> 01:15:37,119
Kiss her for me, would you?

1260
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,119
I'll come visit, promise.

1261
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:43,919
Okay. See you soon.

1262
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:45,439
Ciao, bye.

1263
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:53,079
What an asshole.

1264
01:16:21,399 --> 01:16:22,719
Sorry, sorry.

1265
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:23,919
Where were you?

1266
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:25,158
At the bar.

1267
01:16:25,159 --> 01:16:28,478
The place was packed
so I helped a little and then...

1268
01:16:28,479 --> 01:16:30,198
we had a few drinks.

1269
01:16:30,199 --> 01:16:32,038
- But I called.
- What?

1270
01:16:32,039 --> 01:16:34,879
I know, I didn't want to bother you,

1271
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:37,959
you were sleeping,
and someone stole my phone...

1272
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:40,000
I called the bar,
you weren't there.

1273
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:46,359
- Why did you call the bar?
- You didn't answer.

1274
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:49,118
Who did you speak to at the bar?

1275
01:16:49,119 --> 01:16:51,318
A waitress who told me
you weren't there.

1276
01:16:51,319 --> 01:16:53,319
What did you do then,
call the police?

1277
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:54,800
Really funny.

1278
01:16:55,159 --> 01:16:57,159
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

1279
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:59,839
Nothing, you're the one who's all...

1280
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,158
I don't understand.

1281
01:17:01,159 --> 01:17:03,158
I don't either,
I don't want to...

1282
01:17:03,159 --> 01:17:04,759
Salomé, seriously...

1283
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:07,318
I really don't want to have
this conversation right now.

1284
01:17:07,319 --> 01:17:09,198
Are we really doing this?

1285
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:11,759
We're going to fight
like a stupid normal couple?

1286
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:13,118
Normal couple?

1287
01:17:13,119 --> 01:17:14,839
- It's you.
- Me? It's you.

1288
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:17,158
You're the one who's normal
in this house?

1289
01:17:17,159 --> 01:17:19,679
No, you're the one acting normal,
calling and saying,

1290
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:21,679
"I'm worried, the waitress, blah, blah."

1291
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:24,839
It's about the record label, isn't it?
So don't go, it doesn't matter.

1292
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:27,278
Don't tell me
what I can and cannot do.

1293
01:17:27,279 --> 01:17:28,839
- Is it because you're scared?
- No.

1294
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:30,519
- You're scared to fail?
- No, you are.

1295
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:32,238
You're scared to try and fail.

1296
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:34,278
- No, you're scared!
- What am I scared of?

1297
01:17:34,279 --> 01:17:36,438
Your gift, which is not a gift
but an expectation.

1298
01:17:36,439 --> 01:17:38,198
- Expectation?
- Of course!

1299
01:17:38,199 --> 01:17:39,919
What should I expect from you?

1300
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,599
- To be good enough!
- Good enough?

1301
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,759
- That's all you want.
- Oh, that's nice.

1302
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,879
No, stay,
you're sleeping there tonight!

1303
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:47,239
You reek of alcohol!

1304
01:18:25,319 --> 01:18:26,760
The story repeats itself.

1305
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:30,999
<i>Once again, silence and
misunderstanding on your part</i>

1306
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:34,000
<i>and always empty promises
and cowardice on mine.</i>

1307
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:35,800
Shit...

1308
01:18:39,399 --> 01:18:42,719
<i>The thought of you reading this
as your hair turns white</i>

1309
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:44,999
<i>and your eyes tarnish
makes me want to cry.</i>

1310
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,520
<i>I actually want to cry
as I am re-reading this</i>

1311
01:18:48,199 --> 01:18:51,199
<i>thinking how I could have written
such a ridiculous thing.</i>

1312
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,039
I am so sorry, Salomé.

1313
01:18:55,239 --> 01:18:57,679
<i>I don't deserve all the love
you and Louise gave me</i>

1314
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:59,399
because I am a liar.

1315
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:01,438
I have no home and no money.

1316
01:19:01,439 --> 01:19:03,238
I have no work and no bar.

1317
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:06,318
<i>Nothing of my own,
but that you already knew.</i>

1318
01:19:06,319 --> 01:19:09,359
<i>For three years,
I sold mojitos on the Costa Brava,</i>

1319
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:12,639
cleaned camping crappers in Portugal,

1320
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:14,999
<i>and a lot of other
not so great things,</i>

1321
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,759
believing I was free

1322
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:19,000
and that it was more important...

1323
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:21,799
More important than living a fairy tale

1324
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:23,839
<i>with the woman of my dreams, apparently.</i>

1325
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:24,919
When I came back,

1326
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:28,560
<i>I wasn't expecting to find
you and Loulou behind the door.</i>

1327
01:19:29,319 --> 01:19:33,800
<i>I had nothing better to offer
so, once again, I lied to you.</i>

1328
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:36,680
I was scared of not being enough.

1329
01:19:37,159 --> 01:19:39,399
<i>I'm always scared
of not being enough.</i>

1330
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:41,879
Even if the feelings, the smiles,

1331
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:43,600
all those moments of joy,

1332
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:45,760
were truly sincere.

1333
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:48,879
So, I'm leaving.

1334
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:49,960
Once again.

1335
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:52,199
Maybe this is my path.

1336
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:56,559
Say what you want to Louise.

1337
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:59,318
That I'm in jail because I stole candy.

1338
01:19:59,319 --> 01:20:01,919
<i>That I burned down
the Amazonian forest.</i>

1339
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:04,118
<i>Or that I had
an electric scooter accident.</i>

1340
01:20:04,119 --> 01:20:06,438
At least something ridiculous, okay?

1341
01:20:06,439 --> 01:20:07,920
Not something heroic.

1342
01:20:08,239 --> 01:20:11,239
<i>We often try to turn
those who disappear into heroes.</i>

1343
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,399
I am anything but that.

1344
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:15,519
Or just tell her the truth.

1345
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:17,680
Sometimes, the truth feels better.

1346
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,239
I love you both.

1347
01:20:21,119 --> 01:20:22,239
Scarifon.

1348
01:20:45,119 --> 01:20:46,119
Shit.

1349
01:20:47,239 --> 01:20:48,239
What?

1350
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:51,960
It's Salomé.
Apparently, César is gone again.

1351
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,919
I'll see if he's at Ammad's
or if he's dead beneath a bush.

1352
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:58,038
No, Pierre.

1353
01:20:58,039 --> 01:20:59,358
It'll be 10 minutes.

1354
01:20:59,359 --> 01:21:01,640
I don't care.
Even 10 seconds is too much.

1355
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:05,799
Stop taking care of your brother
and start taking care of your son.

1356
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:07,479
I do take care of him.

1357
01:21:11,479 --> 01:21:12,479
Love?

1358
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:14,759
- It's not a criticism.
- Yes it is.

1359
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:18,640
I know that you're doing your best
and that it mustn't be easy for you.

1360
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:22,359
You have one extra thing to think of.

1361
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,720
César can feed and wash himself.

1362
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:27,719
Not Sasha.

1363
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:29,359
Let him figure things out.

1364
01:21:30,319 --> 01:21:31,640
- Okay?
- Yes.

1365
01:21:32,359 --> 01:21:34,038
We can spend some time just us three.

1366
01:21:34,039 --> 01:21:35,680
Anyways, what can you do?

1367
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:38,600
You can't take care of him
for him.

1368
01:21:47,479 --> 01:21:48,960
What would like to do tonight?

1369
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:51,158
A burger and a movie?

1370
01:21:51,159 --> 01:21:52,199
Okay?

1371
01:21:56,359 --> 01:21:58,239
How's he doing, little kitty?

1372
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:08,800
I know, life isn't easy.

1373
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,439
It's a real pain.

1374
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:17,398
There you go, my love.

1375
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:19,000
You ate well?

1376
01:22:25,239 --> 01:22:26,438
Excuse me?

1377
01:22:26,439 --> 01:22:28,159
I'm selling my cellphone...

1378
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:31,038
Please?

1379
01:22:31,039 --> 01:22:33,759
I'm selling my cellphone, 50 euros.

1380
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:34,880
No, thanks.

1381
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:38,438
Excuse me. I'm selling my cellphone.

1382
01:22:38,439 --> 01:22:39,519
You need help?

1383
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:41,599
Well, yeah.
I have to buy a ticket.

1384
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:43,238
What will you do with the money?

1385
01:22:43,239 --> 01:22:45,959
- Buy a train ticket, I just told you.
- Right, okay.

1386
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:47,559
I'm not really interested.

1387
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:50,078
- But, your glasses, though...
- No, I just bought them.

1388
01:22:50,079 --> 01:22:52,078
- Come on, man.
- No.

1389
01:22:52,079 --> 01:22:54,238
- I'll make a good deal.
- It's okay.

1390
01:22:54,239 --> 01:22:55,960
- How much?
- No...

1391
01:23:08,119 --> 01:23:09,158
Hello sir!

1392
01:23:09,159 --> 01:23:10,719
Sir! Hi.

1393
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,079
Cut the music, please.

1394
01:23:12,439 --> 01:23:14,038
Your permit, please.

1395
01:23:14,039 --> 01:23:15,599
I don't have a permit.

1396
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,199
You need one
to perform on the streets.

1397
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:20,118
I didn't know, sorry.

1398
01:23:20,119 --> 01:23:23,719
The thing is, someone stole my wallet
on this terrasse over there.

1399
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:27,439
I put it on the table,
and a guy took it and left.

1400
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:30,278
I have a train for Brest
leaving in 25 minutes

1401
01:23:30,279 --> 01:23:32,640
and my ticket was in my wallet,
I'm sorry...

1402
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:37,158
I don't want to deal with this.
Leave me alone.

1403
01:23:37,159 --> 01:23:39,919
- Excuse me?
- Leave me alone. You don't speak French?

1404
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:43,278
I need 20 euros to buy a new
train ticket, so leave me alone.

1405
01:23:43,279 --> 01:23:45,519
Watch your tone.
Your ID, please.

1406
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:48,438
Just give me a fine, it's easy,
you know what to do.

1407
01:23:48,439 --> 01:23:51,519
Take your pen and fine me
but don't fuck with me.

1408
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:54,158
Pack your stuff
or we take you to the police station.

1409
01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:57,198
Don't you have some dealers to arrest?
You don't run fast enough?

1410
01:23:57,199 --> 01:23:59,519
- Motherfuckers!
- Let's go, let's go.

1411
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:00,520
Fuck!

1412
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,079
Alright, calm down.

1413
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:05,999
- There's no point in getting upset.
- Of course there's a point!

1414
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,999
Fuck, get my stuff!

1415
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,118
It's all I have.

1416
01:24:09,119 --> 01:24:10,839
That loser broke my arm.

1417
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:13,720
Get in your car,
I'm not going to run away.

1418
01:24:14,479 --> 01:24:16,158
Okay, all good.

1419
01:24:16,159 --> 01:24:19,319
Your signature
on the bottom of the page, please.

1420
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:21,478
There you go.

1421
01:24:21,479 --> 01:24:25,318
When we took your phone, we saw
there was 15 missed calls from your girl.

1422
01:24:25,319 --> 01:24:28,358
We called her back to warn her.
We are not monsters.

1423
01:24:28,359 --> 01:24:29,520
- Thanks.
- Alright.

1424
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:31,920
Your stuff.

1425
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:35,880
There you go.

1426
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:38,560
- Perfect, alright, let's go.
- Thanks.

1427
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,680
- Have a good day, sir.
- Goodbye.

1428
01:24:49,159 --> 01:24:50,239
Look who's here.

1429
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:52,839
I'm sorry.

1430
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:53,920
Shut up.

1431
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:56,039
We'll talk later.

1432
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:58,520
Jump in the back with her.

1433
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:00,639
- Over there?
- Yes, over there.

1434
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:02,439
The back is over there.

1435
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:48,560
These three are new.

1436
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:53,478
This one is for when I lied for the keys.
This one is for when I left.

1437
01:26:53,479 --> 01:26:56,158
This long one is for the custody.

1438
01:26:56,159 --> 01:26:58,000
A custody is a lot of trouble.

1439
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,199
And these ones are...

1440
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:08,318
Do you remember?

1441
01:27:08,319 --> 01:27:09,319
Yeah.

1442
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:12,919
Listen carefully,
you little piece of shit,

1443
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:15,919
drop my fucking things
in front of my fucking door

1444
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:17,599
or I will come and kick your ass.

1445
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:18,839
Okay? Is it...

1446
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:21,078
I don't want to see you ever again,
is that clear?

1447
01:27:21,079 --> 01:27:22,719
- Excuse me.
- Wait, yes?

1448
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:25,238
I've never seen anything
more beautiful in my life.

1449
01:27:25,239 --> 01:27:28,478
Well, since I saw a cow give birth
at the Agriculture Fair.

1450
01:27:28,479 --> 01:27:31,359
It was very touching.
It was big... I mean, it was...

1451
01:27:32,119 --> 01:27:33,519
What's your name?

1452
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:35,078
Salomé, and you?

1453
01:27:35,079 --> 01:27:36,119
César.

1454
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:38,279
You were looking at me like...

1455
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:40,000
The look of love.

1456
01:27:44,319 --> 01:27:47,039
- I'm really sorry...
- Shut up or I'll kick your ass.

1457
01:27:48,359 --> 01:27:49,560
I talk now.

1458
01:27:53,399 --> 01:27:55,479
I also have something to tell you.

1459
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,640
That day on that bench...

1460
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:04,000
I knew something was happening.

1461
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:09,079
For the first time,
I felt like my life was starting.

1462
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:12,880
And...

1463
01:28:12,881 --> 01:28:14,680
when you left...

1464
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:18,520
I felt like nothing
would ever happen again.

1465
01:28:22,079 --> 01:28:24,199
So when you came back...

1466
01:28:26,159 --> 01:28:30,760
I told myself I had to make sure
you'd stay for good, this time.

1467
01:28:46,399 --> 01:28:47,920
I'm sorry, César.

1468
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:52,439
I also lied to you.

1469
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,319
She's not your daughter.

1470
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:16,960
But...

1471
01:29:20,319 --> 01:29:21,840
I do really like her.

1472
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:28,399
She really likes you too.

1473
01:29:40,159 --> 01:29:41,720
So... now what?

1474
01:29:45,239 --> 01:29:47,680
We'll get some ice cream,
for starters.

1475
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:52,560
Yes.

1476
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:03,520
Loulou! Let's go.
We're getting some ice cream.

1477
01:30:04,119 --> 01:30:05,359
You want some ice cream?

1478
01:30:10,079 --> 01:30:12,639
Do you think we look weirder
than everyone else?

1479
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:14,358
Than other Parisians? No.

1480
01:30:14,359 --> 01:30:18,279
Raising kids among pigeons and rats
is weird, anyways.

1481
01:30:28,319 --> 01:30:30,079
Do you think it'll be difficult?

1482
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:31,919
Probably.

1483
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:33,919
But at the same time, maybe not.

1484
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:35,720
No, we can figure it out.

1485
01:30:38,279 --> 01:30:39,640
You want to give money?

1486
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,319
There you go, go ahead.

1487
01:30:49,239 --> 01:30:50,399
Well done!

1488
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:57,799
Let's go on a trip to Arles.

1489
01:30:57,800 --> 01:30:59,000
Arles?

1490
01:30:59,439 --> 01:31:00,800
What's up with Arles?

1491
01:31:01,479 --> 01:31:03,319
I always loved Arles.

1492
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:06,078
Enough with Arles!

1493
01:31:06,079 --> 01:31:08,599
And eat chicken
with the family every Sunday.

1494
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:09,920
No, absolutely not.

1495
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:16,919
Take my hand, take my hand.

1496
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:17,960
Louise.

1497
01:31:19,039 --> 01:31:21,119
It's okay, there are no cars.

1498
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:23,600
Stay on the sunny side of the road.

1499
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:29,599
Come and let César carry you.
It'll be easier.

1500
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:31,279
- On my shoulders?
- Yeah.

1501
01:31:32,399 --> 01:31:34,279
- Come here.
- There you go.

1502
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:40,839
We could move.

1503
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:42,879
No, I hate packing.

1504
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:44,559
We could pretend to move.

1505
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:45,920
Oh, yeah.

1506
01:31:46,399 --> 01:31:48,398
We could visit apartments
and pretend.

1507
01:31:48,399 --> 01:31:49,879
Apartments we don't like.

1508
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:52,000
- And criticize them.
- Not good enough.

1509
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:54,680
And...

1510
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:58,559
And I'll meet with the banker
and pretend I am very rich.

1511
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,198
I want a very big apartment.

1512
01:32:00,199 --> 01:32:02,078
You don't have enough
for an ice cream.

1513
01:32:02,079 --> 01:32:04,118
It's too bad,
I had a big project in mind,

1514
01:32:04,119 --> 01:32:07,520
I wanted to start a seafood
home delivery service.

1515
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:10,759
Yes, it would have been
really successful!

1516
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:13,399
- You're unbelievable!
- We could have lived our dream life.

1517
01:32:14,479 --> 01:32:17,198
Do you think
they'll be able to finish the credits

1518
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:19,999
before we change streets?

1519
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,278
I'm not sure.

1520
01:32:21,279 --> 01:32:22,759
It's pretty long.

1521
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:24,398
People will leave.

1522
01:32:24,399 --> 01:32:26,319
Let's walk a little faster, then.

1523
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:29,158
- We have to keep up.
- Or people will leave.

1524
01:32:29,159 --> 01:32:30,398
Let's go home.

1525
01:32:30,399 --> 01:32:31,799
- You want to go home?
- Yeah.

1526
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:34,039
Loulou, you want to go home?
