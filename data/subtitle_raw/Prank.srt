1
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:28,673
PRANK

2
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,429
...l can promise that you'll have
little time for daydreaming.

3
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,509
Not one moment, in fact.

4
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:49,231
Led by your teachers, who are
peerless in their respective fields...

5
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,431
...you'll begin your course
up a flight of stairs...

6
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:01,189
...to become, one fine day,
respectable men of our country.

7
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:09,193
Possibly, some of you will falter
or go astray on the road.

8
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,515
For as we know, chances are
in abundance to sin...

9
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,798
- One, two, three, rock.
- 7:5.

10
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,792
- Scissors.
- 8:6.

11
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,039
- Stone.
- 9:6.

12
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,549
- Scissors.
- 10:6.

13
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,518
l won. l'm the best.

14
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,637
...at times like these despondency
and despair overcome your souls.

15
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,079
They're dancing!

16
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,675
This is the predecessor of
film, boys.

17
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,717
Originally it is called
''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae.''

18
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,834
And this is the most famous
moving image, the Rat Eater.

19
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,598
All are independent images.
Our brain sets them in motion.

20
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,838
Double!

21
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,469
Redouble!

22
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,110
- Wearing your glasses, eh, Szebeni?
- Of course.

23
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:46,595
Watch it. Don't let it fog up.
Hearts. Ulti captured.

24
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,749
Well, well.
l thought l was dreaming.

25
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,830
You'll be sleepy tomorrow.
A hard day ahead.

26
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,588
What's your first class?

27
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,599
l didn't ask you.

28
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,591
First class is algebra.

29
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,512
lt's my principle that
the first sin shall be forgiven.

30
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,991
We all err.

31
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,472
Do you agree, boys?

32
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,035
Good. Then pick up that filth.
Everyone their own. And get lost.

33
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,717
You stay.

34
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,909
l can see you won.

35
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,108
Do you play well?

36
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,393
Fairly well.

37
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,872
Ulti?

38
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,792
Ulti.

39
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,711
Can l have a look?

40
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,838
- ls it yours?
- lt's mine.

41
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,071
Hold the candle. Closer.

42
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,759
l see now.

43
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,196
Did you mark every card
or just the high- ranked ones?

44
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,192
Why so tongue- tied?

45
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,837
Only the kings. And the aces.

46
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,277
How petty.

47
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,752
You can leave.

48
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,715
Sorry. Really sorry.

49
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,315
Trees are blooming
a second time around this year.

50
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,394
See these white threads?

51
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,674
Tiny spiders weave them
and use them as airships...

52
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,434
...to escape bad weather.

53
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:21,877
l don't feel scents nowadays.
l'm not cold, l'm not hot.

54
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,997
l can't taste flavours either,
it's as if l were eating sawdust.

55
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,520
Time stands still,
like in a photograph.

56
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,518
Have l shown you, Father Ágoston?
My little brother.

57
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,631
l don't know what l'd do
if l didn't have this picture.

58
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,955
''Milan.
Before the fatal match.''

59
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,919
This paper will soon get eaten by
dust and there'll be nothing left.

60
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,993
Who's my master? No one!
Who's mightier than l? No one!

61
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,231
Come and touch my hump! Moles!

62
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,790
What a brute. l had an idiot
like him in my old school.

63
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,556
He wanted us to address him as
''Your Excellency.''

64
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,035
- He's been with a woman.
- Come on! How do you know?

65
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,793
Everybody knows.

66
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,635
- What sort of a woman?
- The female sort.

67
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,551
A housemaid, a whore, a lady?

68
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,516
Then along came that Englishman...

69
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,958
...split my little brother's eardrum,
deafened him for good.

70
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,471
ln my conceit l fathomed l can
challenge the phrase ''for good.''

71
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,197
And that the doctor in Boston
will work wonders.

72
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,272
Boys! Boys...

73
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,868
This is a good place.
l like it here.

74
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,435
What are you rambling about,
Szebeni?

75
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,712
lt's better here
than in my old school.

76
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,031
- Are you mad?
- Szebeni's a moron! He likes it here!

77
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,034
Are you ill, Szebeni?
A good place, this?

78
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,511
Reveille at five- thirty.
Morning wash. lce- cold water.

79
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,230
Mass at six- twenty.
Dormitory check at seven.

80
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,871
Egg barley soup.
Penance! Push- up! Shut up!

81
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,231
They censor your readings...

82
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,472
...search your pockets and make you
run in place in the rain.

83
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,033
And they keep preaching ad nauseam!
And you call this a good place?

84
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,193
Have you memorized the disciplinary
measures, Szebeni? D'you know 'em?

85
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,991
Leave him alone!

86
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,837
Do you or don't you?

87
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,988
Gentlemen, stop chasing it!

88
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,915
He too is God's creature:
''Rattus norvegicus''.

89
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,792
There are scientific methods to chase
it out of the house.

90
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,279
Now go to your classrooms.

91
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,796
Anyone who doesn't
won't get any supper.

92
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,157
Rome. lmperial palace.

93
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,437
Early morning,
an old man wishes to see the ruler.

94
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,319
He's wearing red shoes
with four leather straps...

95
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,599
...a broad purple band on his toga,
gold rings on his fingers.

96
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,991
What does this attire imply?

97
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,155
Tell him! Do you want to
write a test?

98
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,195
That attire in those days
was worn by senators.

99
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,431
Precisely.

100
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:52,475
The bodyguards took the old senator
before Marcus Aurelius.

101
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,634
''What brings you here, my friend?''
the emperor asked.

102
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,477
''l'm worried for my only son, Sir,
he is but fourteen years of age.''

103
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,239
The senator explains...

104
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,196
...that the previous night his son was
arrested by the sentinels...

105
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,432
...near Mars Ultor temple...

106
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,594
...and he is still being held.
He has done nothing.

107
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,400
He was running in an alleyway
with a jackdaw in his hand...

108
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,589
...and a gang of lads chased him,
yelling ''thief! thief!''

109
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,271
There was quite a scuffle.

110
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,637
Who knows what
''Mars Ultor'' means?

111
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,639
Vengeful Mars.

112
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,516
Take a look at this.

113
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,358
Ok, now l've seen it. You can
put it back where you found it.

114
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,074
You're their homeroom teacher,
Father Zoltán. This is Géczy's bed.

115
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,471
- What do you intend to...
- Nothing.

116
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,197
l don't ''intend'' anything.

117
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,237
You've just started here.
Do not judge too hastily.

118
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,675
For the time being consider
yourself Guardian of the Gate.

119
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,275
What sort of Gate?

120
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,755
We need to find out
where it leads to.

121
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,790
l am sorry, Father,
l don't understand.

122
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,193
And this?

123
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,954
Where does this lead?

124
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,593
Third time this week they've
done it to Szebeni.

125
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,395
You know,
the boy with the spectacles.

126
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,513
l know.

127
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,838
l'll find the culprits
and crack down on them.

128
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,231
Do you think this is a sin?

129
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,911
ln every possible way.

130
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:59,395
l ask you not to interfere.
Let's not spoil their fun.

131
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,876
What sort of fun
are you talking about?

132
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,954
l wasn't happy either to find pins
and nails hidden in my pillows...

133
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,715
...or to climb into bed only to land
in a bowl of ice cold water.

134
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,913
But the next day
l did the same to someone else.

135
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,832
We took and we gave.

136
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,031
l poured water in someone's shoe...

137
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,192
...next morning l woke up to find
my feet getting roasted with matches.

138
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,432
We'd sew together
the legs of trousers, hide books...

139
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,631
...roll dead beetles into bread...

140
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,998
...and hide spectacles, pocket watches
and pens in secret dens.

141
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,518
These are just pranks.

142
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,036
The emperor listens empathically
to the senator's complaint...

143
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:41,355
...and promises that his son would be
at home in an hour's time.

144
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,798
The relieved senator leaves.

145
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,473
Marcus Aurelius then summons
the commander of the night guard.

146
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,678
The commander claims the senator's
son acted provokingly...

147
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,160
...so one of the guards, Sextus,
was forced to use his spear.

148
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,954
Szebeni, up here,
you're going to be the emperor.

149
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:08,034
And we'll also need a Sextus.
Sextus is a gigantic lad.

150
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,148
Voice brazen,
fist like a rock.

151
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,150
- Who wishes to be Sextus?
- Me!

152
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,035
Szebeni! What are you
fiddling with down there?

153
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,395
My spectacles disappeared.

154
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,835
- You killed the boy?!
- l killed him.

155
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,436
He was only fourteen years of age.
Playing with a jackdaw.

156
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,992
- How could you do such a thing?!
- He was kicking and screaming.

157
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,836
You killed without reason,
Sextus. That is a capital crime.

158
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,116
Do you know what lies in store
for a Roman soldier...

159
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,874
...who commits a capital crime?

160
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,790
The criminal is led out into
the courtyard of the garrison.

161
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,718
At the captain's signal,
the mercenaries attack him...

162
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:10,439
...beat him with sticks,
stones, bats until he...

163
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,477
Sextus was unable to continue.

164
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,793
This beef of a man stood
in front of the emperor, frightened.

165
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,468
Let them get away with it.
After all, they're just pulling pranks.

166
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,829
Colts. Little colts.

167
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,428
But there's something else
l'd like to show you.

168
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,474
Did you hurt yourself?

169
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,434
ls it broken?

170
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,115
Maybe not.
But it hurts like hell.

171
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,709
Oops! See that?

172
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,795
A string.

173
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:11,435
lt's not a string, Father Zoltán.
lt's a prank. Mischief.

174
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,518
This silence makes me
claustrophobic.

175
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,795
- Makes you what?
- Ssh!

176
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,395
A Hungarian doesn't talk
while eating.

177
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,872
Five crowns to whoever bursts into
a song right here, right now.

178
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,913
Money on the table.

179
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:18,471
''There's a poor orphan girl,
she has no mother, no father...''

180
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:25,717
''...naught to love her,
but she has a friend: solitude.''

181
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:37,911
Pick any teacher, and for five crowns,
l'll smack him so hard.

182
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,674
Aren't we waiting for Rácz?

183
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,114
- He's not coming today.
- Why not?

184
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,196
Didn't say.

185
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,352
- lt's raining. Don't you mind?
- lt's just a drizzle.

186
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,712
The angels are weeping. No wonder.

187
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,679
People are killing each other
in the Balkans again.

188
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,711
You have a nasty cough.

189
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,509
lf l were you l'd go to Pest
and have myself examined...

190
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,719
...with the invention of that German
doctor called Roentgen.

191
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,916
Not that... Never.

192
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,192
Do you believe in the afterlife?

193
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,671
l think the Church uses that story
to hold its believers in line.

194
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,268
lt's so quiet here!
lt reminds me of a poem by Ady.

195
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,670
Do you know Ady?

196
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,833
Endre Ady? Well, not really.

197
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,553
Well, listen then:

198
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,320
''l walk the forest
in the moonlight...''

199
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,351
''...and whistle through
my chattering teeth...''

200
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,799
''...stalking behind me ten feet tall
Good Prince Silence...''

201
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,311
''...-  'mercy' -  l tremble,
dare not turn.''

202
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,396
Do you like it?
D'you want me to continue?

203
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,638
l don't have a knack for these things.

204
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,315
l'll take you in today, OK?

205
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,676
l've no money.

206
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,673
Only three crowns.
Haven't you got three crowns?

207
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,194
You must be joking.

208
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,678
The newsreel, that's the best part.

209
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,158
- Have you never seen a newsreel?
- Never.

210
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,196
- Are we going in?
- We are, but later.

211
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,750
- When?
- When it starts.

212
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,799
Miss Paula.

213
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,517
Why, look who it is, Mr. Schoolboy!
One for tonight's show?

214
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,752
l've just popped in with my friend.
Let me introduce him.

215
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,950
Beck. What's you're first name?
Never mind.

216
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,754
- Pleased to meet you.
- The pleasure is all mine.

217
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,235
My friend has never seen a film.

218
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,594
Five minutes, no more.
The manager might show up.

219
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,348
Your friend can go in
for five minutes.

220
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,633
Your skin is like a silk necktie.

221
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,312
- You can take a seat inside, too.
- l prefer to woo you instead.

222
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,999
Not today. Some other time.

223
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,910
- When?
- Sometime.

224
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,831
''The famous escape artist Morton
has been frozen in a block of ice...''

225
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,550
''...and is now loaded onto a train
and transported to Philadelphia.''

226
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,198
To continue our little discussion
last week about sin and sinners...

227
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,759
Perhaps you remember.

228
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,718
l thought
we'd got to the end of it.

229
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:48,910
lt never ends.

230
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,271
l hoped l convinced you,
Father Weigl.

231
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:55,075
Half convinced me. l let your infinite
benevolence assuage me..

232
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,950
...or shall we call it gullibility?

233
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,637
- ls there something l should know?
- Perhaps.

234
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,310
lndulge me, please.

235
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,388
Let's see. Cards are not sinful...

236
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,234
...although we do say
they're the Devil's game.

237
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,116
Cards? Oh come on! l'm aware
the boys play ultimo. l don't care.

238
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,676
And one of them is
winning too much.

239
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,837
Takes it all. Literally.

240
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,436
- Takes it all?
- Yes.

241
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,395
Slowly, every night
he's bleeding dry the entire class.

242
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,440
He's been at it for weeks.
The only question is...

243
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,716
What is the question?

244
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,156
The question is to what does he
owe his outrageous luck?

245
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,197
Chance? Card skills?
The stupidity of others?

246
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,273
Or could it be something else?

247
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,880
lf a kid were to, say,
mark the cards...

248
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,559
...and this is mere speculation...

249
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:08,194
...and strip his classmates
slowly and methodically:

250
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:13,708
...would that too be just a prank?
A falter?

251
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,353
Have you seen boobs,
Szebeni?

252
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,989
l can't imagine he's ever seen any.

253
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,874
Bromberg, l bet he hasn't.

254
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,958
Szebeni doesn't even want
to see boobs!

255
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,118
He'll remain a virgin all his life.
Did you know, Szebeni...

256
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,351
...that the Mayans,
when praying for rain...

257
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,272
...-  betli, a full - ...

258
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,274
...they threw virgin boys into the
dried wells. Pardon -  grace.

259
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,875
Ready for a betli?

260
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,394
Two coins from you, Bromberg,
two from the virgin.

261
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,076
Who's my master? No one!
Who's mightier than l? No one!

262
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,832
You're a cheat. You cheat.

263
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,878
Say that again.

264
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,711
l've been watching you.

265
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,949
You're cheating.

266
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,913
Cane doesn't work,
next time l'll use a whip...

267
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,519
...and if that doesn't help,
you'll be expelled.

268
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,913
Disgrace for disgrace.

269
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:26,358
You've blown the web of obedience
to smithereens...

270
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:33,119
...trampled on the commands like
a swine. Demons hid in that swine...

271
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,355
...demons, demons, demons!

272
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,239
Five minutes!

273
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:11,519
Oh sir! Father Weigl!

274
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,275
What are you oohing about? Why aren't
you running around with the others?

275
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,671
What a beautiful carving.
May l have a look?

276
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,358
You may.

277
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,749
Line up in double files.

278
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:39,119
Straight as an arrow.
No chit- chat, keep in line!

279
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:44,158
Crawling is the cornerstone
of a victorious attack!

280
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,598
A real soldier slithers and crawls
like a snake.

281
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,395
Attention! Crawl!

282
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,670
He's off the deep end again. Who
here wants to be a real soldier?

283
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,390
No one until there's a Monarchy
and that old fool is on the throne.

284
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,039
Of course, if the war breaks out...

285
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,397
What war? lt's not my war.
l wouldn't take part.

286
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,471
Then you'll be a deserter
and be shot.

287
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,915
C'mon, moron,
this is the 20th century.

288
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:21,438
- Do you see any wars looming?
- Balkans. China. Everywhere.

289
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,159
l'm talking about Europe.

290
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,671
Can you divulge the topic
of your discussion?

291
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,954
The ruins reminded me of
a Japanese saying.

292
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,117
Let's hear it.

293
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,873
''Turn to the ruins if you wish
to learn more about ruins.''

294
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,953
Japanese? Wonderful.

295
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,676
- l know a longer one, too.
- Let's hear it.

296
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,198
''l see summits...''

297
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,432
''...and rugged cliffs
and flowery meadows...''

298
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,477
''...under a golden Moon.''

299
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,280
That's a poem, idiot.

300
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,310
Stand up!
Form a line around the apse!

301
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,076
This isn't over yet.

302
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,909
l couldn't care less. l'll smack
him around for ten crowns.

303
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:26,676
And l'll yank his ears
until they both fall off.

304
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,438
Géczy and Köllner! Fifty.

305
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:56,553
''Turn to your arm if you wish
to learn more about your arm.''

306
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,829
A Japanese poem.

307
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,992
Stand up! Stop!

308
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,912
Mutiny! Anarchy!

309
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,670
Stand up! You too, stand up!

310
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,399
- Only 27, sir!
- Stand up!

311
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:50,316
This is mutiny. Stand up. Stop.

312
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,194
Hey, you... give us our grub.

313
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,112
None for you.

314
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,509
What's that supposed to mean?

315
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,117
No grub today. Maybe not even
tomorrow. That's all we were told.

316
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,955
l know of a starvation artist
who's paraded around in a cage.

317
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,475
He held out for forty days.

318
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,271
They gave him lemon and water
from time to time.

319
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,194
Moron, shut your mouth or l'll
punch you. Get us our supper now.

320
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,398
Careful, the principal!

321
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:06,195
Seventh- graders won't be
receiving supper for a while.

322
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,274
The reason: anarchic behaviour
during physical exercise.

323
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:20,835
Penalties of this sort are usually
meted for a whole week...

324
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,713
...but thanks to Father Zoltán's
intercession...

325
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,919
...we shall content ourselves
with three days this time.

326
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,469
However, as cumulative
punishment, the chief culprits...

327
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,672
...Dániel Géczy,
György Beck and László Kölner...

328
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,675
...shall have to kneel for the
duration of supper deprivation.

329
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,439
You may begin at once, boys.

330
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,194
Excuse me, sir...

331
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,632
- The Rats?
- What?!

332
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,468
Are you watching the Rat Eater?

333
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,830
No. Not the Rat Eater.

334
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,919
What do you want, Szebeni?
Why did you come to me?

335
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,035
l lost my...

336
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,713
What?

337
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,717
My diary.

338
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,395
Here? ln my cell?
You want to find it here?

339
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,158
Of course not.

340
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,389
Keeping a diary? Excellent.

341
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,356
Self- knowledge
develops character.

342
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,395
What did it look like?

343
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:21,156
A small, lined copybook.

344
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,799
Keep better watch of your
personal belongings, Szebeni.

345
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,551
l'll ask the Brothers
to keep their eyes open.

346
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,516
Now go, Szebeni.

347
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:07,151
Throw the ball high, it plummets,
then slam it with your forehead.

348
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:13,236
Use your neck. Your neck!
What are you doing? Come on.

349
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,476
You can head from the hand, too.

350
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,792
And the arse. Care to show us?

351
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:35,076
Sorry. l'm only looking for my
copybook. lt has a blue cover.

352
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,875
Have you seen it?

353
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,313
l saw a copybook under a tree this
morning. But it had a green cover.

354
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,836
- Which tree?
- So what was it? Blue or green?

355
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:50,235
- l don't know, l'm colorblind.
- Me too.

356
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,716
Come in.

357
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,112
l'm sorry. l'll be just a moment.
According to the weather forecast,

358
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,794
we're in for a severely cold
winter this year.

359
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:12,795
Harsh frost, fog,
Egyptian darkness at times.

360
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,913
That sort of weather
is bad for football.

361
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,756
The boys will be at risk
for idleness of the body...

362
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,391
...sluggishness of heart and mind.
That can lead to fits of temper...

363
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:27,997
...aggression, and what is
most dangerous, melancholy.

364
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,390
You obviously know better than l
that during the lnquisition...

365
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,995
...the melancholic were burnt
at the stake...

366
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,073
...because they were
thought to be infectious.

367
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,710
Fortunately, l have an idea
how to prevent that from happening.

368
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,188
How?

369
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,589
We shall introduce boxing.
Boxing can be pursued indoors...

370
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,957
...and it can help vent
pent- up frustration.

371
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:11,078
Mór Jókai once said,
''our best ally is our own fist.''

372
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:16,115
Of course,
we can't do without gloves...

373
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,993
What are you doing?! You can't
touch those. Put them back!

374
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,198
Right away,
just let me delight in them.

375
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,955
That's amazing -  it's the best
brand in the world.

376
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,599
How dare you! Stop it!

377
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:36,518
''Everlast'' -  Father, you're hiding
a real wonder in your cell.

378
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,590
You can't do that,
stop it, stop it, stop it!

379
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,112
Where did you get it?
Did you ever box?

380
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,354
The two of us could give
the kids a presentation...

381
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,794
Enough!

382
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,789
l had hoped...

383
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,477
Never mind. l give up.

384
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:33,715
The rule is to collect twenty- five
snow- white pebbles in two minutes.

385
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,197
Strictly snow- white ones.

386
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:41,438
Only two minutes isn't enough.
At least l haven't succeeded yet.

387
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,594
And if you did succeed?

388
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,479
l would receive news...

389
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,517
Go on...

390
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:55,435
...that my brother is alive -
that is the news l'm waiting for.

391
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:07,838
All they informed me of insofar is
that he disappeared.

392
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,318
My son... My dear son.

393
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,473
l was practically panhandling to raise
money for the ferry ticket.

394
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:18,553
l'm alone responsible... Me alone.

395
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:23,438
He'd come to terms with
his deafness but l pushed him...

396
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,478
...saying you must get better,
you must...

397
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,030
And if l did it out of
selfish ambition?

398
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,953
So that
l too could bask in glory?

399
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:46,750
Surely Providence cannot impose
such a sin upon me.

400
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:57,713
The following story
took place in 1 765...

401
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,350
...in a Benedictine monastery
in the Carpathian mountains.

402
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,678
There lived a highly educated
young monk called Cyprian...

403
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,388
...who was obsessed with flying.

404
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:17,352
For years
he worked on his invention...

405
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,592
...in the secret of the night,
in the cellars of the monastery.

406
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:25,751
Then early one morning
he decided the time was right...

407
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,191
...and he slipped out of
the monastery...

408
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,279
...dragging behind his contraption.

409
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:36,196
He climbed up to the top of
a nearby mountain, 1000 metres high...

410
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:44,878
...attached the device to his arms,
muttered a prayer and ascended.

411
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:48,039
He was truly swimming in the air.

412
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:54,314
His fellow monks watched Brother
Cyprian in awe and suspicion.

413
00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:01,036
The Bishop of Nitra ordered
that this so- called ''Devil's Chariot''...

414
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:06,674
...be burnt in public -
in the market place.

415
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,878
A huge crowd gathered round.

416
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,078
The proceedings were accompanied
by rude yells and cackles.

417
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,756
Subsequently, Cyprian
was expelled from the monastery...

418
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,708
...on charges of shaking hands with
the Devil.

419
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,675
That's all for now. We'll turn to the
subject of gravity after snack time.

420
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,231
Anybody hungry?

421
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,074
That was how things were
with flying in the old days.

422
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:40,916
Slander and failure and ignorance.

423
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,316
Times have changed since then.

424
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,673
But will Jókai be proven right?

425
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,910
''Flying will bring
everlasting peace on Earth.''

426
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,311
A nice thought. But l'm not so sure
it holds up any more.

427
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:01,229
My dad, too, is waiting for the
Golden Age, but my grandfather says...

428
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,955
...that history ended
with the Battle of Königgrätz...

429
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,112
...and no big changes are expected.

430
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,189
And you, what do you think?

431
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:13,716
l believe that crazy acts
make the world go round.

432
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,673
What are you doing here
at half past three in the morning?

433
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,391
Show me your hands.

434
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,517
You'll get expelled for this.

435
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,872
Oh... l only...
lt was only meant to be a joke...

436
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:03,271
A joke? Fun? A laugh?

437
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,674
To humiliate the Principal,
the choir and the congregation?

438
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,990
- But...
- Don't say a word.

439
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:14,354
You'd just be lying. Mocking.

440
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:27,357
Tomorrow you'll visit Father
Damian. He's your confessor, right?

441
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:35,236
Good, so he'll hear your
confession, give you penance...

442
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:38,593
...and we'll forget about it.

443
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,956
But you should know
l could have you expelled...

444
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,631
...if it weren't for your parents
who are such decent folk.

445
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:50,311
- Now begone.
- Yes. Thank you.

446
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,876
Only l'd like to clean up.

447
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:00,438
These are consecrated objects.
Consecrated floors.

448
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:03,319
l shan't have you soil them
even more.

449
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,709
Go away, will you!

450
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:19,590
l would've come earlier, but some
idiot tied together a bunch of shoes.

451
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:20,636
Tough luck.

452
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,950
- Are we going to get off lightly?
- Perhaps.

453
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,000
lf it weren't for Father Zoltán, l'd
by chucked out of here.

454
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,912
- As would l.
- They wouldn't know about you.

455
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:32,199
- But l would tell them.
- lt wouldn't help me.

456
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:42,708
- Still, we did it, mate!
- You did it. A heroic deed.

457
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,714
Don't be silly, we planned it
together. Only l had the ink.

458
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:51,872
Status: in hiding. Reason:
fear of literature test.

459
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,837
Father Ágoston is under
the weather.

460
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:58,072
l'm substituting him,
so there will be no test.

461
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,197
Sit back now.

462
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:07,314
lt is public knowledge that
l am a humorless man.

463
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,952
l consider humor to be repulsive.

464
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:15,395
And poetry, too. Understand?

465
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,838
Good. That's settled.

466
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,075
The man's insane.

467
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,511
The other day
l came across a copybook.

468
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,718
Among the notes l discovered
a thought that l recommend...

469
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:43,590
...to use as a guiding principle
along the bumpy path of your lives.

470
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,717
The sentence reads as such:

471
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:55,671
''lt is as simple to keep going as
it is hard to know why.''

472
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,913
Let me repeat:

473
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:05,954
''lt is as simple to keep going as
it is hard to know why.''

474
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:15,793
That copybook...

475
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,356
l lost that copybook.

476
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,918
Did you? Good news.

477
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:27,791
Authorless scribbles and stray dogs
are so depressing.

478
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:33,028
- Can l have it back?
- What do you mean?

479
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:36,950
Give it back, sir. Please.

480
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,436
l realise it's a precious object.

481
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:45,877
lts contents are also precious.
As they say, it is confessional.

482
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,593
You write fondly of your mother.

483
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:56,831
Please don't...
You mustn't, it's private.

484
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:11,109
My mother is a rose, a violet,
and springtime dawn.

485
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:16,392
Are great minds born or nurtured,
and what are their characteristics?

486
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:21,719
- Really nothing to add to that.
- Please give my copybook back.

487
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,511
Self- love is a bit excessive:

488
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:27,797
''l'm overcome with melancholy.
Who am l, what am l?''

489
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:30,679
''l'm surrounded
by searching glances.''

490
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,798
- Loving your neighbour is...
- This is torture!

491
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:41,836
Our Japanese scholar.
ls this your field, too?

492
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,119
Szebeni's copybook is his own!

493
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:48,316
Who else's would it be?

494
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,515
You heard:

495
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:02,153
''lt is as simple to keep going as
it is hard to know why.''

496
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,910
We all know what it means
to keep going.

497
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,432
But there can be so many
reasons.

498
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:18,397
l want to know why you dream
of smacking teachers around.

499
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,273
You deny it?

500
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,999
Rise up, vermin!

501
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:43,394
This scribble plainly illustrates,
who and how many smackeroos.

502
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:47,155
But the motive goes unmentioned
by our faithful chronicler.

503
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:48,270
Bloody stool pigeon!

504
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:51,159
lnformer.
Even feels sorry for himself!

505
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,999
Traitor! lnformant!

506
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,231
Shut up.
He didn't squeal on anybody.

507
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:59,234
He was scribbling for himself only.
Unfortunately, he lost his copybook.

508
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:02,028
On the first page he drew a skull,
and wrote:

509
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,874
''Woe betide he who reads this.''

510
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:12,077
Woe to me. But l'm alive.
So, the slappings.

511
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,994
The other teachers aren't here,
so l shan't mention them.

512
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:18,915
Mihály Rácz offered to give me
two punches and a nose twist...

513
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:21,629
...against the sum of five crowns. Why?

514
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,194
Stand up.

515
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,359
l'm waiting to hear your answer.

516
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,399
lt was just a joke.

517
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,359
Joke?

518
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,031
Like l said, l have no
sense of humour.

519
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:45,157
So Mihály Rácz, go ahead
and accomplish your wish.

520
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,551
Two punches and a nose twist.

521
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:59,079
Are you afraid?

522
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,433
Sir, you're provoking him!

523
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:06,356
Dániel Géczy would smack
me hard...

524
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:10,275
...and yank my ears
till they fell off.

525
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,753
All for ten crowns.

526
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,754
Let's see, then. Here's ten.
l'll even put up the money.

527
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:23,235
Come on! A smack and the ears.

528
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,476
Loudmouths.

529
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:43,189
Never short of great ideas.
Only lacking execution.

530
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:46,996
Take Szebeni,
our chronicler, for example.

531
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:50,277
He'd slap me so hard on the nape
of the neck that l'd fall over.

532
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:51,989
Let's see.

533
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:59,551
Szebeni, at least you should
make your dreams come true.

534
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:01,955
Come.

535
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:50,669
Enter. Close the door.

536
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:55,917
Come closer.

537
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:13,591
Where're your boots?

538
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,995
The boys tied some boots
together.

539
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,749
This has to come to an end.

540
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,118
The Devil is teasing you all.

541
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,917
Stand on one leg.

542
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,957
Now on the other one.

543
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,877
Pity about you, Szebeni.

544
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,113
You're a good observer.

545
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:52,954
You'd make a fine
war correspondent.

546
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,394
Do you know the rules of
disciplinary measures?

547
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:58,319
l do.

548
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:03,675
Which is the most severe
punishment? Lift the leg higher.

549
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:07,196
ln the case of indisputable
moral corruption...

550
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:13,549
...a nationwide ban from all schools.

551
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:19,072
lndeed. l haven't yet mentioned
what transpired to anyone.

552
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:21,959
But in the morning l shall have to
report it to the Principal.

553
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,839
That would kill my mother.
My dad, you know...

554
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:30,234
Not so loud.
l hate emotional blackmail.

555
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:36,670
Please beat me,
every day, all year round.

556
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:41,153
And don't give me any food.
And l'll kneel.

557
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:45,678
l wanted to do no harm.
Only everyone mocks me.

558
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,391
They think l'm a coward.

559
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:58,557
Please whip me.
l can take lashes.

560
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:05,837
There's another solution.

561
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:21,115
''List of Hungarian victims
of the Titanic''

562
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:26,190
Almost everyone travelling
first class was saved.

563
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:32,711
But he had a second- class ticket.

564
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:40,870
151 7 killed. He is one of them.

565
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:49,395
And yesterday,
from all kinds of signs l deduced...

566
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:53,793
...that l'd be getting good news.

567
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,356
My dear son, let's pray.

568
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,751
The grandest ship in history.

569
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:16,275
A portentous name.

570
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,994
l should have thought of mythology.

571
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:24,750
The Titans were the
sons of the cruel Uranus...

572
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,753
...who devoured their own sons.

573
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,433
Repeat after me.

574
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:42,951
Lord have mercy upon us sinners
and hear our prayers.

575
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:52,118
We pray for our brothers
and sisters suffering in Purgatory.

576
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:54,876
Never shall l pray again.

577
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,351
Just hold him down.

578
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:06,080
What did you write in
your little diary yesterday?

579
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,517
Whom did you tell on?

580
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:16,673
Enough.

581
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,032
That's enough.

582
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,278
Hold him down.

583
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,436
Don't forget to include this!

584
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:14,116
- Father Zoltán is rarely with us.
- Maybe he's ill. Or mourns his brother.

585
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:17,875
Or is confused.
We must persuade him.

586
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:20,111
His excessive
lenience results...

587
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,157
...in only anarchy.

588
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:25,598
We need to introduce only two
or three innovations.

589
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:28,354
They're good boys,
they would understand.

590
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:33,713
Halt.

591
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:55,113
Simon, step out.

592
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,031
What a surprise.

593
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,279
Stop it.

594
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,233
Who tied them together?

595
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:27,197
l shan't ask again,
who tied them together?

596
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,874
l shall ponder the punishment.

597
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:52,828
Simon and Rácz,
come and see me tonight.

598
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:59,158
Better have unfair punishment
than crimes go unavenged.

599
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:02,314
Who said that?

600
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:07,599
Johann Wolfgang Goethe said it.

601
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:14,352
l shan't mention his poems.
But he was a great statesman.

602
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,152
Now go.

603
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,194
l want to be Cicero.

604
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,396
He isn't involved
in the conspiracy.

605
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:31,519
Apparently he ''looks with
such red, fiery eyes.''

606
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:36,834
''Good evening, Casca:
will you bring Caesar home?''

607
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:38,752
Who will be Caesar? l suggest Rácz.

608
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,228
- l suggest Géczy.
- Me too, Rácz.

609
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:43,189
''Are we all ready?''

610
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,352
''What is now amiss that Caesar
and his Senate must redress?''

611
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,512
- Let me be Brutus!
- And me Antony!

612
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:51,758
Antony was a tall bloke.

613
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,788
Fine, you be Antony. l'll be
Cassius. Géczy, who're you?

614
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:57,314
Who am l? l really don't know.

615
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:59,278
l'm Brutus, l'm Brutus!

616
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:00,919
''Our enemies have beat us
to the pit:''

617
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:03,629
''lt is more worthy to leap in
ourselves than tarry till they...''

618
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:07,839
l'll be the Soothsayer.
''Beware the ides of March.''

619
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:14,150
l'll be the man who warns Caesar
of the danger, Artemidorus.

620
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:22,548
''Caesar, beware of Brutus;
take heed of Cassius;''

621
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:30,354
''come not near Casca; have an eye
to Cinna, trust not Trebonius:''

622
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:37,073
''mark well Metellus Cimber:
Decius Brutus loves thee not:''

623
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:39,791
''thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius.''

624
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:44,037
My dear boys,

625
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:46,835
that is enough.

626
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:49,236
The performance has been cancelled.

627
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,158
l'm very sorry.

628
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:58,029
You've worked so hard, studied
the play, learnt your passages.

629
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:06,472
l'm really sorry. The Fathers
decided it wasn't timely now.

630
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:12,390
Please do not comment
on the event.

631
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:17,035
l've written something
on the blackboard that Cicero said.

632
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,637
Let's translate it
and call it a day.

633
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:24,832
l'd like a volunteer.

634
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:31,749
''There is no one who loves
pain itself, who seeks it''

635
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:37,677
''who wants to have it,
simply because it is pain...''

636
01:08:58,320 --> 01:08:59,514
l have a bad feeling.

637
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:09,590
The last time
we were talking about inventions,

638
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:16,034
the many setbacks
and perseverance it takes.

639
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:21,229
How inventors kept starting anew,
even if they despaired at times.

640
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:24,111
Don't you forget that.

641
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:27,511
As to our Saturday meetings,

642
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:32,673
we'll have to suspend
them indefinitely.

643
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:48,389
Boys, boys, why are
you forcing me to do this?

644
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:53,394
Why can't you stop doing this?

645
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:03,236
So childish.

646
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:10,873
Wet towel, shoelaces, beetles.

647
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:15,959
Whatever.

648
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,796
Stand face to face.

649
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:33,395
A bit closer.

650
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:39,113
That's right.

651
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:46,478
Rácz, you tied
Simon's shoelaces together.

652
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:49,513
You owned up to it,
didn't you?

653
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:57,357
This is how it is going to be
from now on. Eye for an eye.

654
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:02,838
l want a virile, hard
slap on the face, Simon.

655
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:09,028
- A slap?
- No need to be sheepish.

656
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:11,669
You're not taking it,
you're giving it.

657
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:15,278
Give a hard one.

658
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:18,191
One that leaves a mark.

659
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,757
Simon?

660
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:30,318
Come on!

661
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:34,273
Simon!

662
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:40,637
Simon...

663
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:43,632
D'you call that a slap?

664
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:47,397
Do you call that virile?

665
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:53,075
Rácz, show this weakling
what a real slap feels like.

666
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:04,990
C'mon Rácz!

667
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,750
Give Simon a slap!

668
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:18,510
That's what l call a virile slap.

669
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:21,232
D'you see Simon?

670
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,238
Your turn.

671
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:31,591
C'mon Simon. Give him a slap.

672
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:56,468
He's coming.

673
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:25,309
Bromberg, hand out the copybooks.
The tests are null and void.

674
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:26,993
The class cheated.

675
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:32,510
Only Szebeni completed it
by himself...

676
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:36,719
...but if l'm not mistaken,
he produced the crib sheets.

677
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:39,312
This never used to happen before.

678
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,794
l don't know what's got into you.
What's going on here?

679
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:48,790
We're in a bad mood,
Father Zoltán.

680
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:56,520
Dishonesty is warranted
by a bad mood then.

681
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,711
Duly noted.

682
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:02,872
And now we retake the test.

683
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:06,159
Each of you will have
an individual question.

684
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:08,198
You can start.

685
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:25,199
This is too much.

686
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:26,790
Have you seen Szebeni?

687
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,031
- Where?
- Watching from a window.

688
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:34,991
He'll report to Weigl that we left
school without permission.

689
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:38,433
A hundred lashes. Or a thousand.

690
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:42,435
- Scourges.
- That can hurt, for sure.

691
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:44,557
Up my arse.

692
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:50,319
l'm going to be an aeroplane
engineer. Did l tell you?

693
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:51,310
ls there such a thing?

694
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:54,279
There has to.
Someone has to design them.

695
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:57,991
l'm going to be a poet.
A great poet.

696
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:01,631
That isn't a profession.

697
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:13,512
Father Zoltán.

698
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:24,716
Come, come in. Sit down.

699
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,916
Let me get to the point.

700
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:40,514
ln a few hours
l shall be leaving the school.

701
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:44,238
l would liked to have said
goodbye to the class...

702
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:46,711
...but l wasn't allowed to.

703
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:50,276
Yet you're saying goodbye to me.

704
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:54,679
You're mature enough
not to misunderstand me.

705
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:03,355
You'll like my successor.

706
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:08,232
He's an excellent mathematician.
He employs amusing methods.

707
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:12,475
l wrote him a long letter,
introducing the class.

708
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:17,992
Everything has changed.
Everything's become nasty.

709
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,437
l don't understand anything.

710
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:28,797
l know. Last week,
after Father Ágoston died...

711
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:31,076
...even the angels left the school.

712
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:34,432
- ls that why you are leaving?
- No, of course not.

713
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,638
That would count as an act of
abandonment.

714
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,472
lt still feels like one.

715
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:45,798
l have to go.

716
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:48,632
Don't ask why because...

717
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:54,672
...l'm not going to answer.

718
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:58,038
That's an answer, too.

719
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:06,191
What is it?

720
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:08,715
l overheard you were
off. Why didn't you tell me?

721
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:10,393
Don't shout.

722
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:11,914
This is an old appointment.

723
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:14,116
For once, Rácz takes me
somewhere, and not me him.

724
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:15,952
Where? The cinema?

725
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,270
No, no, not there.
l only go there with you.

726
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:19,629
You'd better.

727
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:22,348
Watch out.
Rácz is a disgusting brute.

728
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:24,039
So am l sometimes.

729
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:32,835
So that's it. The famous
''Palace of Pleasures''.

730
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:35,430
This?!

731
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:38,232
What did you expect?

732
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:45,358
There's a piano. And curtains
in the private box upstairs.

733
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:56,358
That redhead comes
from a saloon in Pest. From Pest!

734
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,911
So, shall we?

735
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:19,031
Look, l don't think l will.

736
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:22,159
Another time.

737
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,274
What?!

738
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:30,112
See you at school.

739
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:52,795
So finally you managed to show up,
Mr. Schoolboy.

740
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:55,110
l have a name, l told you.

741
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:58,670
l know. Dániel. l thought
you'd been devoured by lions.

742
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:00,478
You haven't come for weeks.

743
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:03,633
l didn't think l'd be missed.

744
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:04,995
Well, you weren't.

745
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:07,713
Aren't you going to ask
where my friend is?

746
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:08,790
Who?

747
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:12,470
Oh yes, your little friend.
ls he here too?

748
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:15,430
Nope. Are you sorry?

749
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:19,317
He will be sorry because
the manager has gone to Pest.

750
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:21,551
Now you can watch the newsreel.

751
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:26,351
l saw it last time. The three of us
watched it: you, my friend and l.

752
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:28,591
This one's new. lt just came today.

753
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:33,755
And the two of you held hands
throughout.

754
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:36,794
You fool! He's just a little boy.

755
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:39,516
l saw it.

756
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:42,632
What did you see?

757
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:47,308
l'll show you
if you join me inside.

758
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:57,316
BOX OFFlCE CLOSED.

759
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:09,358
- Have you ever kissed?
- No. And you?

760
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:16,032
l have, but that doesn't count.
l can teach you.

761
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:21,439
Would you like to?

762
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:24,913
Of course.

763
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:52,718
At last.

764
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:55,394
Have you been waiting for me?

765
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:56,675
Yep.

766
01:20:57,640 --> 01:20:59,676
You knew l was still in town?

767
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:01,268
Yep.

768
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:23,113
Lipstick...
Just joking. Don't worry.

769
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:27,228
Look. l used your money
to buy a new pack of cards.

770
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,911
Wait.

771
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:54,631
Stay in your beds.

772
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:03,030
Brandy... Simon, a candle...

773
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:17,280
- Cards.
- Tobacco!

774
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:28,431
Aren't you interested, Szebeni?

775
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,352
Not the least bit.

776
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:36,196
What happened?

777
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:39,794
The Madame...

778
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:47,398
...didn't want to let me in at first.

779
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:51,839
At first.

780
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:53,559
Blonde or brunette?

781
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:57,193
Blonde.

782
01:22:57,720 --> 01:22:58,869
Thin?

783
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:03,232
Just right.

784
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:06,311
Was she clean? Did she smell nice?

785
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:36,676
Stop it! We need to think up
something new.

786
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:40,559
What?

787
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:51,159
Fire?

788
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:03,719
Get a scarf.

789
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:24,148
We're going to blindfold you now.

790
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:39,149
Stand up.

791
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:02,717
Drink, Szebeni!

792
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:17,559
Sing!

793
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:22,753
Softly.

794
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:36,639
''l have but one sweetheart,
l give her my soul,''

795
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:43,791
''she is beautiful and so dear...''

796
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,470
Let's tickle him!
Let's tickle the traitor.

797
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:18,910
- Aren't you going to laugh?
- Harder!

798
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:24,073
Lay him on the bed.

799
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:38,793
Tickle him with this.

800
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:57,518
Go on!

801
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:02,959
Tickle him!

802
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:11,670
What's this?

803
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:15,276
Tickle him! Tickle him!

804
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:00,519
No..!

805
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:16,754
Did you teach the traitor a lesson?

806
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,672
l did.
