2
00:00:49,108 --> 00:00:51,573
Please, just let her go.

3
00:00:51,575 --> 00:00:52,492
You, kid.

4
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:55,612
Here, please.

5
00:00:55,614 --> 00:00:56,447
Now!

6
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:58,807
Fucking now!

7
00:00:58,809 --> 00:00:59,640
No!

8
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:00,473
Shut up!

9
00:01:11,334 --> 00:01:14,301
Put your hands up!

10
00:01:37,993 --> 00:01:39,552
So I reach in my back pocket.

11
00:01:39,554 --> 00:01:40,423
Nothing.

12
00:01:40,425 --> 00:01:41,520
I check my other pocket.

13
00:01:41,522 --> 00:01:42,797
Nothing.

14
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,323
Then it dawns on me.

15
00:01:44,325 --> 00:01:46,465
I left my wallet at home.

16
00:01:46,467 --> 00:01:48,125
And the waiter's coming
by every couple of minutes

17
00:01:48,127 --> 00:01:49,151
to pick up the check

18
00:01:49,153 --> 00:01:51,069
and I'm just sitting there
drunk out of my mind,

19
00:01:51,071 --> 00:01:53,187
processing this mistake.

20
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:55,955
He graciously continues to
offer me more time to pay

21
00:01:55,957 --> 00:01:57,750
but I only had pocket change for this guy.

22
00:01:59,093 --> 00:02:02,872
So my drunk-ass self somehow
comes to the conclusion,

23
00:02:02,874 --> 00:02:04,542
my shirt costs the same as this meal.

24
00:02:05,388 --> 00:02:06,966
So I proceed to start striping,

25
00:02:06,968 --> 00:02:10,647
placing my shirt in the
middle of the table.

26
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:12,744
Oh, that poor waiter.

27
00:02:12,746 --> 00:02:15,214
Always was a complete idiot drunk.

28
00:02:15,216 --> 00:02:16,670
Excuse me?

29
00:02:16,672 --> 00:02:17,503
Cute.

30
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:18,691
Cute idiot.

31
00:02:18,693 --> 00:02:19,598
All right, all right, all right.

32
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,935
- All right, all right.
- Cool, I'll take that, yeah.

33
00:02:21,937 --> 00:02:24,830
O-M-G, my dudes.

34
00:02:24,832 --> 00:02:26,613
Jason texted me.

35
00:02:26,615 --> 00:02:28,207
I told you it was serious.

36
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:29,356
God.

37
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:30,668
What?

38
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,558
It's a dick pic.

39
00:02:34,093 --> 00:02:34,924
You know what,

40
00:02:34,926 --> 00:02:37,735
I am so glad to see real
romance still exists.

41
00:02:37,737 --> 00:02:39,404
Okay, hold on, hold on.

42
00:02:39,406 --> 00:02:42,262
Last week, I mean, he bought me flowers.

43
00:02:42,264 --> 00:02:45,224
That's pretty romantic, right?

44
00:02:45,226 --> 00:02:47,046
You're right, I remember that.

45
00:02:47,048 --> 00:02:49,245
Yeah, you were like
highly allergic to them

46
00:02:49,247 --> 00:02:50,202
- and your face...
- Okay!

47
00:02:50,204 --> 00:02:51,775
- Just disgusting.
- Okay, yes!

48
00:02:51,777 --> 00:02:53,856
My point exactly, look.

49
00:02:53,858 --> 00:02:54,741
- Oh.
- Look!

50
00:02:54,743 --> 00:02:56,140
Oh, that's a bad angle.

51
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:58,113
You guys are missing the point entirely.

52
00:02:58,115 --> 00:03:00,973
If he's still sending me
pictures of his precious cargo

53
00:03:00,975 --> 00:03:05,375
after seeing my face blown
into horror shit show.

54
00:03:05,377 --> 00:03:06,379
She's right.

55
00:03:06,381 --> 00:03:07,766
I see marriage in your future.

56
00:03:07,768 --> 00:03:08,599
Yeah.

57
00:03:08,601 --> 00:03:09,673
Wait, shut up!

58
00:03:09,675 --> 00:03:11,008
But yes, me too.

59
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,416
Didn't you guys like meet online?

60
00:03:14,418 --> 00:03:15,249
Yeah, whatever.

61
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:17,154
Isn't that like how
everyone meets these days?

62
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:18,099
That's a fair point

63
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:21,175
but I feel like divorce
rate's also going up.

64
00:03:21,177 --> 00:03:22,734
It's like a huge percentage

65
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:23,899
- of people get divorced...
- Screw you!

66
00:03:23,901 --> 00:03:26,153
In that online section.

67
00:03:26,155 --> 00:03:27,809
Right?

68
00:03:27,811 --> 00:03:28,644
What?

69
00:03:29,499 --> 00:03:31,167
What, nothing.

70
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,002
Just...

71
00:03:32,873 --> 00:03:35,019
I'm gonna make you my wife one day.

72
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:36,331
Oh God!

73
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,936
Oh my God!

74
00:03:37,938 --> 00:03:39,713
Oh, this is happening right now!

75
00:03:39,715 --> 00:03:42,815
Okay, I am gonna go back here.

76
00:03:42,817 --> 00:03:43,908
Kara!

77
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:44,862
I'm fine.

78
00:03:44,864 --> 00:03:48,206
Don't mind me, I'm not even here.

79
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,112
Are you good?

80
00:03:50,114 --> 00:03:51,637
Has he done it yet?

81
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,470
No.

82
00:03:52,472 --> 00:03:55,237
He's not proposing
tonight, are you serious?

83
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:56,572
What the hell?

84
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,780
Okay, no more alcohol for her.

85
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:04,793
Bring that over here.

86
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:11,082
You know I wasn't just
saying that though, right?

87
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,050
I'm gonna make you my wife.

88
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:14,618
One day soon.

89
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,372
You can't do that,
I'll take you serious.

90
00:04:16,374 --> 00:04:17,777
- Well good.
- I will.

91
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:19,452
I want you to.

92
00:04:19,454 --> 00:04:22,091
I've never been more serious
about anything in my life.

93
00:04:22,093 --> 00:04:23,427
Well you would make me the happiest wife

94
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,628
that ever existed.

95
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,260
So,

96
00:04:27,262 --> 00:04:29,243
I'm just clarifying but

97
00:04:29,245 --> 00:04:31,225
when I ask, it's a yes, right?

98
00:04:31,227 --> 00:04:32,588
Oh my gosh, yes.

99
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,421
Yes?

100
00:04:33,423 --> 00:04:34,254
Yes!

101
00:04:34,256 --> 00:04:35,087
- Woo!
- Yes, yes!

102
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:36,368
- It's a yes!
- Good.

103
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,956
That's a, you know, pre-ask.

104
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,421
Get all the jitters out.

105
00:04:39,423 --> 00:04:40,753
That is so pathetic.

106
00:04:40,755 --> 00:04:42,203
Really, oh, pathetic?

107
00:04:42,205 --> 00:04:43,506
Yeah.

108
00:04:52,547 --> 00:04:55,333
Who told you to stop?

109
00:04:55,335 --> 00:04:56,532
Why do I feel like
this is the only reason

110
00:04:56,534 --> 00:04:58,051
you keep me around?

111
00:04:58,053 --> 00:05:00,062
She's on to me.

112
00:05:00,064 --> 00:05:02,834
You all are corny as fuck.

113
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:04,469
Do you think she knows?

114
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,384
Of course she
does, she's ignoring it.

115
00:05:06,386 --> 00:05:09,053
Let her be, calm down, everything is okay.

116
00:05:10,775 --> 00:05:12,517
Do you hear that?

117
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,594
What, Kara?

118
00:05:13,596 --> 00:05:15,377
- Yeah, she's humming whatever.
- No, no.

119
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:16,462
Those voices.

120
00:05:18,907 --> 00:05:20,907
They're like whispering.

121
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,811
I don't hear anything.

122
00:05:32,027 --> 00:05:32,885
Nope.

123
00:05:32,887 --> 00:05:33,718
Hey.

124
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,868
We aren't there.

125
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,893
What's going on?

126
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,728
They're watching us.

127
00:05:45,382 --> 00:05:46,649
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's going on?

128
00:05:46,651 --> 00:05:47,533
What's going on?

129
00:05:47,535 --> 00:05:48,366
Kara!

130
00:05:48,368 --> 00:05:49,199
Kara, help!

131
00:05:50,034 --> 00:05:51,033
You okay?

132
00:05:51,035 --> 00:05:52,817
What's going on, hey.

133
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:54,602
Baby, look at me, look at me.

134
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:55,435
Everything's okay, all right?

135
00:05:55,437 --> 00:05:56,618
Oh my God, how can you not hear that?

136
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,115
They're so loud!

137
00:05:58,117 --> 00:05:59,925
Is she hearing things?

138
00:05:59,927 --> 00:06:01,702
No.

139
00:06:01,704 --> 00:06:03,250
Babe, no one else is here, I...

140
00:06:03,252 --> 00:06:04,948
Stop it! Stop it!

141
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:05,874
Bella!

142
00:06:05,876 --> 00:06:06,959
Bella! Bella!

143
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,052
This isn't where you wanted to be.

144
00:06:26,054 --> 00:06:27,721
Enjoy those moments.

145
00:06:30,072 --> 00:06:31,989
You wanted to be happy.

146
00:06:32,938 --> 00:06:34,077
Is this a dream?

147
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:35,077
A dream?

148
00:06:36,047 --> 00:06:38,134
A dream, she knows.

149
00:06:38,136 --> 00:06:41,848
Let her think what she wants.

150
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,376
What is it that I know?

151
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:52,828
Okay, it's just a dream.

152
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,663
It's...

153
00:06:55,441 --> 00:06:56,941
It's just a dream.

154
00:07:00,912 --> 00:07:02,079
Where are you?

155
00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:08,896
Bella.

156
00:07:13,286 --> 00:07:14,796
Bella.

157
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:18,776
Bella, Bella, Bella.

158
00:07:18,778 --> 00:07:19,659
What?

159
00:07:19,661 --> 00:07:21,171
Bella.

160
00:07:21,173 --> 00:07:22,290
Bella.

161
00:07:22,292 --> 00:07:23,123
Stop!

162
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:24,323
Bella.

163
00:07:24,325 --> 00:07:25,156
Stop.

164
00:07:25,158 --> 00:07:26,335
Bella.

165
00:07:26,337 --> 00:07:27,619
Bella.

166
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:28,794
- Bella.
- Stop!

167
00:07:28,796 --> 00:07:30,272
Bella.

168
00:07:30,274 --> 00:07:31,156
Bella.

169
00:07:31,158 --> 00:07:32,355
Bella.

170
00:07:32,357 --> 00:07:33,188
Bella.

171
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,021
Bella.

172
00:07:34,023 --> 00:07:35,113
Bella.

173
00:07:35,115 --> 00:07:35,946
Bella.

174
00:07:35,948 --> 00:07:36,935
- Bella?
- Stop!

175
00:07:36,937 --> 00:07:37,918
Bella!

176
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,218
Bella.

177
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,353
Bella

178
00:07:40,355 --> 00:07:41,765
Bella, Bella.

179
00:07:41,767 --> 00:07:42,677
Bella!

180
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:43,661
Bella!

181
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:44,967
Bella?

182
00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:46,552
Bella?

183
00:07:46,554 --> 00:07:48,120
Bella, wake up.

184
00:07:48,122 --> 00:07:50,636
Oh my God, all you do is sleep.

185
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:51,471
Get up.

186
00:07:53,631 --> 00:07:54,464
Finally.

187
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,779
Come on, Frank said I can't
open any of my presents

188
00:07:58,781 --> 00:08:00,281
until you get out.

189
00:08:01,812 --> 00:08:02,729
Presents?

190
00:08:04,407 --> 00:08:06,352
My birthday.

191
00:08:06,354 --> 00:08:07,687
Are you serious?

192
00:08:10,801 --> 00:08:11,832
No.

193
00:08:11,834 --> 00:08:15,001
Of course I'm not serious, I remember.

194
00:08:20,429 --> 00:08:22,668
What're you doing in my room?

195
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,714
You know you're not allowed to be in here.

196
00:08:23,716 --> 00:08:24,821
Get out! Get out!

197
00:08:24,823 --> 00:08:26,895
Well maybe if you slept a night...

198
00:08:26,897 --> 00:08:27,730
Shut up!

199
00:08:28,623 --> 00:08:30,817
Oh, that time of the month?

200
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:32,092
Explains a lot.

201
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,699
You asshole, out!

202
00:08:33,701 --> 00:08:34,534
Bitch!

203
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:01,150
About time you got up.

204
00:09:01,152 --> 00:09:02,255
Good morning.

205
00:09:02,257 --> 00:09:03,507
Good morning.

206
00:09:06,873 --> 00:09:08,155
You just wake up?

207
00:09:08,157 --> 00:09:09,081
Yeah, do I look great?

208
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,416
Oh, fantastic.

209
00:09:11,444 --> 00:09:12,599
Mmmmm.

210
00:09:12,601 --> 00:09:14,739
- Hey, question.
- Yeah?

211
00:09:14,741 --> 00:09:17,322
Did we go to the beach yesterday?

212
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:20,525
- Happy birthday to you.
- Happy birthday to you.

213
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:23,966
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

214
00:09:23,968 --> 00:09:28,400
♪ Happy birthday dear Mason ♪

215
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:31,735
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

216
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,763
- Gosh.
- Yay.

217
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:40,084
So, what'd you wish for, Mase?

218
00:09:41,169 --> 00:09:42,566
Was it a date with that pretty girl

219
00:09:42,568 --> 00:09:43,953
you've been waling home from school with?

220
00:09:43,955 --> 00:09:45,036
Ew, Aunt Karen, no!

221
00:09:45,038 --> 00:09:46,975
Of course not.

222
00:09:46,977 --> 00:09:49,109
All right, shall we open gifts?

223
00:09:49,111 --> 00:09:50,944
That's a yes though.

224
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,719
Oh, they grow up so fast.

225
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:59,270
Yeah, I know, can't
play tricks on him anymore.

226
00:09:59,272 --> 00:10:00,495
What kind of tricks?

227
00:10:00,497 --> 00:10:01,845
Oh, you know, like the basic kind

228
00:10:01,847 --> 00:10:04,276
of sibling rivalry kind of stuff.

229
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:07,664
Like convince him he was
adopted for a good six months.

230
00:10:09,312 --> 00:10:10,757
Oh, and then I told him worms

231
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:12,654
were like a huge health benefit.

232
00:10:12,656 --> 00:10:14,102
He ate a good like seven of them.

233
00:10:14,104 --> 00:10:15,719
Oh my God, you're sick.

234
00:10:15,721 --> 00:10:17,063
This is why I'm happy
I didn't have sisters.

235
00:10:17,065 --> 00:10:19,342
It's all psychological warfare, it's sick.

236
00:10:19,344 --> 00:10:20,917
What, and your brother
didn't do anything to you?

237
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:24,427
No, he did, but it's
all physical stuff, like,

238
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:26,708
I don't know, noogies and wedgies

239
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,638
and twisting my nipples till my nose bled.

240
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,656
Bella, didn't you have
something for Mason?

241
00:10:32,658 --> 00:10:33,741
Yeah, yeah.

242
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,916
Read what it says.

243
00:10:52,803 --> 00:10:54,354
"Fearless."

244
00:10:54,356 --> 00:10:55,773
Yeah, fearless.

245
00:10:57,564 --> 00:11:01,848
The necklace Mom and Dad
gave you said "brave," right?

246
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:04,478
I know this isn't the same.

247
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,018
This is the necklace they
gave me when I was little

248
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,687
but I never wore it.

249
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,680
I just thought if you were scared or

250
00:11:16,764 --> 00:11:19,122
if you're having any
bad dreams or anything

251
00:11:19,124 --> 00:11:20,927
that maybe this will help a little bit

252
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:23,544
just to know it's there.

253
00:11:23,546 --> 00:11:24,412
Thank you.

254
00:11:24,414 --> 00:11:25,664
Yeah.

255
00:11:27,205 --> 00:11:28,973
Hey, can I cut the party short?

256
00:11:28,975 --> 00:11:31,240
I really wanna play my new video game.

257
00:11:31,242 --> 00:11:33,575
Oh yes, of course.

258
00:11:38,103 --> 00:11:41,032
Do you think he liked it?

259
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:44,819
I mean, it's a pretty
deep gift but, yeah.

260
00:11:44,821 --> 00:11:46,988
Yeah, I think he liked it.

261
00:11:48,116 --> 00:11:50,168
Might even make up for you thinking

262
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,673
he was adopted for six months, who knows?

263
00:11:52,675 --> 00:11:54,276
I feel bad now.

264
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:56,958
I mean, if you put on the
card it was from both of us...

265
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,570
I'm gonna get some drinks.

266
00:11:58,572 --> 00:11:59,403
Okay.

267
00:11:59,405 --> 00:12:00,236
Do you want anything?

268
00:12:00,238 --> 00:12:01,503
Scotch, actually, would...

269
00:12:01,505 --> 00:12:02,336
It's too early.

270
00:12:02,338 --> 00:12:03,169
Oh, come on,

271
00:12:03,171 --> 00:12:04,159
- it's a party though!
- It's too early.

272
00:12:04,161 --> 00:12:05,170
Ugh, fine.

273
00:12:05,172 --> 00:12:06,003
Water.

274
00:12:06,005 --> 00:12:07,755
- There we go.
- Ugh.

275
00:12:08,938 --> 00:12:10,779
Don't be afraid.

276
00:12:10,781 --> 00:12:12,994
You enjoyed that moment.

277
00:12:12,996 --> 00:12:15,939
You were happy but it's over now.

278
00:12:27,711 --> 00:12:28,815
Somebody!

279
00:12:28,817 --> 00:12:29,648
Let me out!

280
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,138
She doesn't know.

281
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,106
No, she knows.

282
00:12:33,108 --> 00:12:35,353
She wants to be happy.

283
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:37,521
She's refusing to remember.

284
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,782
She doesn't have much time left.

285
00:12:39,784 --> 00:12:41,573
- Enjoy the moment she has.
- Shut up!

286
00:12:43,495 --> 00:12:44,328
What?

287
00:12:48,486 --> 00:12:50,903
Please, please don't hurt me.

288
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:53,750
I didn't mean it.

289
00:12:56,478 --> 00:12:57,311
Please.

290
00:12:58,256 --> 00:13:01,376
You need to listen to us.

291
00:13:01,378 --> 00:13:02,316
Where am I?

292
00:13:02,318 --> 00:13:03,401
What are you?

293
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,782
Just let me understand.

294
00:13:09,784 --> 00:13:11,534
Okay, please, just...

295
00:13:15,992 --> 00:13:17,544
You understand.

296
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:18,379
Hello?

297
00:13:20,212 --> 00:13:21,045
Bella?

298
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,641
Bell.

299
00:13:23,643 --> 00:13:24,476
You okay?

300
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,393
I heard yelling.

301
00:13:28,278 --> 00:13:29,475
Bad dream?

302
00:13:29,477 --> 00:13:33,727
What is it?

303
00:13:38,788 --> 00:13:39,621
Um...

304
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:43,941
Something weird's been happening.

305
00:13:43,943 --> 00:13:45,443
It's in my dreams.

306
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:49,546
No, no, no, I
understand, it's your mind.

307
00:13:49,548 --> 00:13:53,069
Your mind is just playing games with you.

308
00:13:53,071 --> 00:13:56,178
It's gonna take more time
to get over what happened.

309
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,212
- Oh, no, no.
- You're just...

310
00:13:57,214 --> 00:13:58,538
That's not what I was talking about.

311
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,113
You experienced the
kind of traumatic event

312
00:14:00,115 --> 00:14:03,615
that no one should ever have to deal with.

313
00:14:12,275 --> 00:14:16,608
Nobody ever said this would
be easy, did they, Bell?

314
00:14:18,031 --> 00:14:19,698
I miss Lisa so much.

315
00:14:21,012 --> 00:14:24,831
She was the best sister
a brother could have.

316
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,750
And a wonderful mother.

317
00:14:28,538 --> 00:14:30,871
I see so much of her in you.

318
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,599
You know, your Aunt Karen and I

319
00:14:37,601 --> 00:14:39,303
weren't able to have a family of our own

320
00:14:39,305 --> 00:14:42,016
but helping her raise you and Mace,

321
00:14:42,018 --> 00:14:46,518
just being part of that, has
made us feel like we did.

322
00:14:50,154 --> 00:14:51,427
Thank you.

323
00:14:58,141 --> 00:15:00,322
We'll get through this.

324
00:15:00,324 --> 00:15:01,574
Together, okay?

325
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:13,817
Hey, is she in her room?

326
00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:14,986
Yes.

327
00:15:16,338 --> 00:15:17,441
Well,

328
00:15:17,443 --> 00:15:21,360
good morning to you at
4:30 in the afternoon.

329
00:15:21,362 --> 00:15:24,471
Okay, so, I need some advice.

330
00:15:24,473 --> 00:15:26,076
Jason asked me to hang out again

331
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:29,137
and when I asked him where
or what he wanted to do,

332
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:31,838
he was like, oh, I was
thinking maybe we can just

333
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,306
hang out in my car for a few hours.

334
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,488
Winky face, winky face.

335
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:37,321
Hey!

336
00:15:38,156 --> 00:15:39,450
You listening?

337
00:15:39,452 --> 00:15:40,285
No.

338
00:15:42,035 --> 00:15:43,361
Wait, but seriously, he said that?

339
00:15:43,363 --> 00:15:44,437
Yeah.

340
00:15:44,439 --> 00:15:46,277
That tool-bag move.

341
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,112
I know.

342
00:15:48,356 --> 00:15:50,346
What do I even say back?

343
00:15:50,348 --> 00:15:51,181
No?

344
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:53,449
Or...

345
00:15:53,451 --> 00:15:55,161
I'm classier than that or something.

346
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:57,224
No, it's gotta be
something heavier than that.

347
00:15:57,226 --> 00:16:00,439
Okay, something that's gonna
really put him in his place.

348
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:02,256
I mean, I have been trying to think

349
00:16:02,258 --> 00:16:04,288
of a savage response for hours.

350
00:16:05,439 --> 00:16:06,943
I'm gonna blast his ass all over Twitter.

351
00:16:08,106 --> 00:16:09,631
Yeah, and I'm sure
all 32 of your followers

352
00:16:09,633 --> 00:16:10,785
will really appreciate that.

353
00:16:10,787 --> 00:16:14,434
Okay, anyone can go viral on Twitter.

354
00:16:14,436 --> 00:16:17,309
Just watch, girl, it's gonna be me.

355
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:18,142
Jeez.

356
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:21,404
All right, I wanna help but get up.

357
00:16:21,406 --> 00:16:22,297
I think better when I walk

358
00:16:22,299 --> 00:16:24,262
and I've been meaning to
check out the new park.

359
00:16:24,264 --> 00:16:25,181
No, um...

360
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:29,402
Not my fault.

361
00:16:29,404 --> 00:16:30,529
Do you want me to help or not?

362
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,999
Do you know how much I spent on these?

363
00:16:32,001 --> 00:16:33,730
Don't know, don't care.

364
00:16:33,732 --> 00:16:34,792
Fine, whatever.

365
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:35,625
Let's go.

366
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:36,897
Don't care, don't keep me waiting.

367
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:37,732
Let's go.

368
00:17:06,184 --> 00:17:07,015
So.

369
00:17:07,017 --> 00:17:07,848
So?

370
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:08,949
You and Adam?

371
00:17:08,951 --> 00:17:10,451
Things going well?

372
00:17:11,675 --> 00:17:14,258
He wants to make me his wife.

373
00:17:15,141 --> 00:17:15,972
Oh my God.

374
00:17:15,974 --> 00:17:16,805
I know!

375
00:17:16,807 --> 00:17:17,638
I didn't even have to say.

376
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,889
I said, you know what,
I'll say yes when you ask.

377
00:17:18,891 --> 00:17:20,434
Oh, no way.

378
00:17:20,436 --> 00:17:21,357
Oh my gosh.

379
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,275
If he would've ask me right
there, which he should've,

380
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:25,803
it would've been a yes.

381
00:17:25,805 --> 00:17:26,685
Wow.

382
00:17:26,687 --> 00:17:28,596
Real love still exists.

383
00:17:28,598 --> 00:17:30,236
I'm so jealous.

384
00:17:30,238 --> 00:17:31,069
Yeah, you know,

385
00:17:31,071 --> 00:17:32,441
I didn't actually ever think

386
00:17:32,443 --> 00:17:34,046
I was gonna fall in love with anybody.

387
00:17:34,048 --> 00:17:36,381
But I fell in love with him.

388
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:40,269
It sucks, you know?

389
00:17:40,271 --> 00:17:41,162
What?

390
00:17:41,164 --> 00:17:41,997
Why?

391
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,974
He fell in love with that
Bella that was confident

392
00:17:46,976 --> 00:17:48,850
and always had her shit together.

393
00:17:48,852 --> 00:17:53,242
Was always this
happy-go-lucky carefree girl.

394
00:17:53,244 --> 00:17:54,667
And after everything, look at me now.

395
00:17:54,669 --> 00:17:56,661
- Like, half the time...
- Hold on, hey.

396
00:17:56,663 --> 00:18:00,432
If the same situation
had happened to Adam,

397
00:18:00,434 --> 00:18:01,922
you'd be there too.

398
00:18:01,924 --> 00:18:03,433
You guys are a team.

399
00:18:03,435 --> 00:18:07,261
One person follows, the
other picks them back up.

400
00:18:07,263 --> 00:18:08,794
Aw.

401
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:09,813
That's so cheesy.

402
00:18:09,815 --> 00:18:11,596
Oh my God, all right!

403
00:18:11,598 --> 00:18:13,778
It was a rare occasion.

404
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:17,113
Yeah, those heels look like they suck.

405
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:20,543
So how's his dick?

406
00:18:20,545 --> 00:18:22,325
He won't stop sending pictures.

407
00:18:22,327 --> 00:18:24,153
Well, obviously, because
you're always sending him nudes!

408
00:18:24,155 --> 00:18:26,272
Oh, it was one time.

409
00:18:26,274 --> 00:18:27,133
Ow!

410
00:18:27,135 --> 00:18:29,489
What, you okay?

411
00:18:29,491 --> 00:18:30,778
- Oh, come on.
- Ugh, seriously?

412
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,148
What the hell?

413
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,995
People littering all over mother earth.

414
00:18:33,997 --> 00:18:35,500
It's disgusting.

415
00:18:35,502 --> 00:18:37,658
Yeah.

416
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,493
Oh my God.

417
00:18:40,568 --> 00:18:42,568
Did you cut your hand?

418
00:18:44,107 --> 00:18:46,107
I thought I did.

419
00:18:46,109 --> 00:18:46,942
Guess not.

420
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,397
No, not again.

421
00:19:16,848 --> 00:19:19,292
Are you the ones that
have been talking to me?

422
00:19:24,252 --> 00:19:26,972
Look, I can't do this anymore.

423
00:19:26,974 --> 00:19:28,291
Okay, this needs to stop.

424
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:30,624
Whatever you want me to do, I'll do it.

425
00:19:42,316 --> 00:19:43,733
What do you want?

426
00:19:48,717 --> 00:19:49,962
What do you want?

427
00:19:53,636 --> 00:19:56,171
We don't want anything.

428
00:19:56,173 --> 00:19:58,411
You already know what you did.

429
00:19:58,413 --> 00:20:00,830
You want to remember.

430
00:20:01,695 --> 00:20:03,078
I'm not afraid of you!

431
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,347
You never should have been.

432
00:20:09,478 --> 00:20:13,311
We aren't the ones that
are going to hurt you.

433
00:20:15,816 --> 00:20:16,983
Then who is?

434
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:38,170
Where have you been?

435
00:20:38,172 --> 00:20:40,672
We were about to leave.

436
00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:41,507
Leave?

437
00:20:42,655 --> 00:20:44,436
Hey, if you're gonna take one of those,

438
00:20:44,438 --> 00:20:46,953
at least help me carry with the bags.

439
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:51,254
The beach, it's family
beach day, remember?

440
00:20:51,256 --> 00:20:52,811
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

441
00:20:52,813 --> 00:20:53,646
Come on.

442
00:21:11,448 --> 00:21:12,279
Banana.

443
00:21:12,281 --> 00:21:13,476
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna have a banana.

444
00:21:13,478 --> 00:21:14,909
The water is a bit warm.

445
00:21:14,911 --> 00:21:15,742
Yes?

446
00:21:15,744 --> 00:21:16,575
Yes? Yeah?

447
00:21:16,577 --> 00:21:18,080
I can't interpret that.

448
00:21:18,082 --> 00:21:19,312
I got them.

449
00:21:19,314 --> 00:21:20,343
Crackers.

450
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:21,176
Fine.

451
00:21:21,178 --> 00:21:22,112
Are you gonna do it?

452
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:22,945
Fine.

453
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,611
Jeez.

454
00:21:24,613 --> 00:21:25,694
- No, no, no, I'm the baker!
- All right, here we go!

455
00:21:25,696 --> 00:21:26,527
Here we go!

456
00:21:26,529 --> 00:21:27,585
- I'm the baker.
- Throw them from top.

457
00:21:27,587 --> 00:21:28,513
No cards from the bottom.

458
00:21:28,515 --> 00:21:29,919
I think we have to match it.

459
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:31,638
Does everyone here
know how to play poker?

460
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,021
Or you can raise it.

461
00:21:33,023 --> 00:21:33,854
Or you can raise...

462
00:21:33,856 --> 00:21:35,168
Do your nails later, come on!

463
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,478
I don't wanna do my nails later!

464
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,583
I'll be there in a minute!

465
00:21:37,585 --> 00:21:39,837
We're going, let's go!

466
00:21:49,495 --> 00:21:50,328
Hmmm.

467
00:21:54,937 --> 00:21:56,020
Is he asleep?

468
00:21:59,483 --> 00:22:01,612
Yeah, out like a light.

469
00:22:01,614 --> 00:22:03,979
We should probably be
heading home soon, then.

470
00:22:03,981 --> 00:22:06,645
- Yeah.
- Before it gets dark.

471
00:22:06,647 --> 00:22:08,147
It's a long drive.

472
00:22:13,129 --> 00:22:16,344
You two remind me so much
of us when we were younger.

473
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,380
Did I ever tell you the balcony story?

474
00:22:19,382 --> 00:22:20,213
Oh.

475
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:21,046
Only a million times.

476
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:21,908
No, no, no, I haven't heard it.

477
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,671
All right, what happened?

478
00:22:23,673 --> 00:22:25,774
When we were kids, her uncle,

479
00:22:25,776 --> 00:22:27,919
being the romantic that he is,

480
00:22:27,921 --> 00:22:31,510
climbed up the side of my
house and knock on my window

481
00:22:31,512 --> 00:22:34,334
just to five me a flower
before I went to bed.

482
00:22:34,336 --> 00:22:36,602
He always

483
00:22:36,604 --> 00:22:40,596
was as quiet as possible so he
wouldn't wake up my parents.

484
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,405
One night...

485
00:22:43,407 --> 00:22:46,657
Yep, I wore the wrong climbing shoes.

486
00:22:48,072 --> 00:22:49,396
Slipped.

487
00:22:49,398 --> 00:22:50,927
Fell off, messed up my ankle.

488
00:22:50,929 --> 00:22:51,760
Aw.

489
00:22:51,762 --> 00:22:53,551
Woke up the entire neighbourhood.

490
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:59,248
I'm very glad you guys
don't have a two story house.

491
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:02,333
What a pain in the ass that would be.

492
00:23:04,363 --> 00:23:05,702
Wait a minute.

493
00:23:05,704 --> 00:23:06,537
Are you?

494
00:23:07,564 --> 00:23:08,787
We should be heading back.

495
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:10,220
I'm a little tired.

496
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,202
He comes over every night.

497
00:23:13,204 --> 00:23:14,787
Dude, she's boring.

498
00:23:19,547 --> 00:23:21,557
Frank, that beer earlier was, I mean,

499
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:23,254
it was lovely, really.

500
00:23:23,256 --> 00:23:24,894
Full body but light.

501
00:23:24,896 --> 00:23:26,356
Did you notice how light?

502
00:23:26,358 --> 00:23:27,969
I mean, I could drink it all day.

503
00:23:27,971 --> 00:23:28,802
It was great.

504
00:23:28,804 --> 00:23:29,635
All day?

505
00:23:29,637 --> 00:23:31,286
No, no, not like I'm
an alcoholic or anything.

506
00:23:31,288 --> 00:23:32,674
Like, my uncle was but...

507
00:23:32,676 --> 00:23:33,507
- Oh my God.
- Other side.

508
00:23:33,509 --> 00:23:34,613
- We're gonna head out.
- My mom's side of the family.

509
00:23:34,615 --> 00:23:35,466
- Again, I'm tired.
- So it didn't really.

510
00:23:35,468 --> 00:23:36,299
Yeah.

511
00:23:36,301 --> 00:23:37,392
- We will meet you.
- A lot of traffic.

512
00:23:37,394 --> 00:23:38,757
- Thank you, again!
- Yeah!

513
00:23:41,127 --> 00:23:42,986
I never heard anything.

514
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:43,988
Me either.

515
00:23:49,285 --> 00:23:50,211
Bella, I'm so sorry.

516
00:23:50,213 --> 00:23:51,259
I did not think that one through.

517
00:23:51,261 --> 00:23:52,678
No, you didn't.

518
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,233
You gonna unlock it?

519
00:24:16,475 --> 00:24:17,308
You okay?

520
00:24:20,075 --> 00:24:20,908
Yup.

521
00:24:22,124 --> 00:24:23,957
Bella, that's a lie.

522
00:24:25,438 --> 00:24:27,091
Come on, what you thinking about?

523
00:24:27,093 --> 00:24:28,426
You can tell me.

524
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:34,267
It's hard to...

525
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:38,518
I think...

526
00:24:45,036 --> 00:24:47,119
I don't know what's real.

527
00:24:48,259 --> 00:24:50,009
What's real?

528
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:54,640
I'm hearing things.

529
00:24:58,031 --> 00:24:59,198
Insane things.

530
00:25:01,062 --> 00:25:06,054
But I don't know if it's
actually happening though.

531
00:25:06,056 --> 00:25:06,889
Okay.

532
00:25:08,481 --> 00:25:10,064
What're you seeing?

533
00:25:11,062 --> 00:25:12,062
This room.

534
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:16,506
It's this white room and
I keep ending up in it.

535
00:25:16,508 --> 00:25:18,091
This thing, this...

536
00:25:20,262 --> 00:25:22,794
These monsters that...

537
00:25:22,796 --> 00:25:26,018
Are talking to me or yelling at me

538
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:30,770
and I think they're trying to
tell me I'm gonna die soon.

539
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:34,147
You don't believe me.

540
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:36,537
Adam, I think I'm really in danger.

541
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:39,056
They keep telling me that
I don't have much time left

542
00:25:39,058 --> 00:25:42,094
or something or someone
is going to kill me.

543
00:25:42,096 --> 00:25:43,179
Okay, stop.

544
00:25:45,365 --> 00:25:46,365
You're safe.

545
00:25:47,718 --> 00:25:49,722
No one is out to get you
and even if someone was,

546
00:25:49,724 --> 00:25:52,695
I would never let them touch you.

547
00:25:52,697 --> 00:25:54,063
The therapist said this
would be a long road

548
00:25:54,065 --> 00:25:55,588
with a lot of side effects.

549
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,259
This will probably come
and go so you don't...

550
00:25:57,261 --> 00:25:59,388
No, no, this is nothing
to do with that because...

551
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,057
Yes it does, okay?

552
00:26:02,089 --> 00:26:03,243
You're stressed thinking about...

553
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:06,117
No, Adam, this has nothing
to do with my parents.

554
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:07,786
Okay, this...

555
00:26:07,788 --> 00:26:08,619
I'm in danger.

556
00:26:08,621 --> 00:26:10,803
No, you're not in danger.

557
00:26:10,805 --> 00:26:12,292
Okay, it's all in your head.

558
00:26:12,294 --> 00:26:13,472
PTSD symptoms.

559
00:26:13,474 --> 00:26:14,779
No, this is not PTSD!

560
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,179
Before you know it, everything
will be back to normal.

561
00:26:16,181 --> 00:26:17,459
It's a lot more
complicated than that, Adam.

562
00:26:17,461 --> 00:26:19,346
Your therapist said a lot of
stuff like this would happen.

563
00:26:19,348 --> 00:26:20,546
Please, just listen to me.

564
00:26:20,548 --> 00:26:22,107
Let me at least explain right now

565
00:26:22,109 --> 00:26:23,578
because I'm really in danger and...

566
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,801
No, you're not in danger!

567
00:26:24,803 --> 00:26:25,808
You just think you are.

568
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:26,799
Just listen to me!

569
00:26:26,801 --> 00:26:27,681
Maybe you should just
start taking your meds...

570
00:26:27,683 --> 00:26:29,336
Listen to me!

571
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:30,483
I tell you I'm in danger

572
00:26:30,485 --> 00:26:32,779
and you pull this mental health card?

573
00:26:32,781 --> 00:26:34,525
Tell me to go just take some fucking pills

574
00:26:34,527 --> 00:26:36,915
and everything will be all right, right?

575
00:26:36,917 --> 00:26:38,755
Even after I repeatedly tell you that this

576
00:26:38,757 --> 00:26:40,366
has nothing to do with my parents.

577
00:26:40,368 --> 00:26:43,253
You want my help and I'm being honest.

578
00:26:43,255 --> 00:26:45,779
I'm not pulling any card.

579
00:26:45,781 --> 00:26:46,612
I'm telling you exactly

580
00:26:46,614 --> 00:26:47,876
what a trained professional would say.

581
00:26:47,878 --> 00:26:52,010
But I didn't ask for a
trained professional, Adam!

582
00:26:52,012 --> 00:26:54,877
I asked for what you
would say, so be Adam.

583
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:59,879
Be my boy friend for just a few
freaking seconds, would you?

584
00:27:06,829 --> 00:27:08,662
Because I'm so scared.

585
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:18,150
I'm sorry.

586
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:20,372
All right.

587
00:27:22,336 --> 00:27:26,552
I want to help but I don't
know how and it's frustrating.

588
00:27:26,554 --> 00:27:29,137
Tell me what you want me to do.

589
00:27:31,179 --> 00:27:32,846
Just listen to me.

590
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:35,523
Trust me.

591
00:27:37,633 --> 00:27:41,908
If you can, I'm not
asking you to be discreet.

592
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,128
Maybe you're right.

593
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,797
Maybe it's all fake.

594
00:27:48,645 --> 00:27:51,228
But to me it feels beyond real.

595
00:27:54,899 --> 00:27:57,232
I feel like I'm going crazy.

596
00:27:59,532 --> 00:28:01,115
You're not crazy.

597
00:28:04,164 --> 00:28:06,294
It's time to go back.

598
00:28:06,296 --> 00:28:08,811
There's nothing left of this moment.

599
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:09,646
It's over.

600
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:11,971
- You don't wanna...
- What?

601
00:28:11,973 --> 00:28:14,285
Stay for the rest.

602
00:28:14,287 --> 00:28:15,393
Is it happening?

603
00:28:15,395 --> 00:28:17,562
Is it happening right now?

604
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:21,397
They're gonna take me back.

605
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:22,936
Where?

606
00:28:22,938 --> 00:28:23,771
That room?

607
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:26,702
Are you hearing voices right now?

608
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:29,091
Just close your eyes.

609
00:28:29,093 --> 00:28:30,668
- You can come back.
- I'm not going back.

610
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:31,501
- I'm not going back.
- You don't wanna

611
00:28:31,503 --> 00:28:32,865
- stay for this.
- Bella!

612
00:28:32,867 --> 00:28:34,291
- Don't do it.
- Listen to us.

613
00:28:34,293 --> 00:28:35,323
Bella!

614
00:28:37,877 --> 00:28:38,710
Bella!

615
00:28:45,137 --> 00:28:46,304
No.

616
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,446
Bella!

617
00:28:48,448 --> 00:28:49,279
Shit!

618
00:29:00,904 --> 00:29:01,737
So,

619
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,440
you still okay to drive?

620
00:29:22,898 --> 00:29:24,398
Do you see that?

621
00:29:25,749 --> 00:29:26,666
That light?

622
00:29:29,909 --> 00:29:30,742
Adam.

623
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,632
Adam?

624
00:29:40,773 --> 00:29:41,606
Adam.

625
00:29:49,708 --> 00:29:50,541
Adam?

626
00:30:02,753 --> 00:30:03,586
Adam.

627
00:30:16,153 --> 00:30:16,986
You stop.

628
00:30:18,334 --> 00:30:19,167
Stop.

629
00:30:20,539 --> 00:30:21,372
You stop!

630
00:30:22,805 --> 00:30:23,888
Listen to me!

631
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:25,820
Leave me alone!

632
00:31:26,877 --> 00:31:27,877
Put me down.

633
00:31:42,176 --> 00:31:44,093
Why are you doing this?

634
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:53,203
The waiter's coming
by every couple minutes

635
00:31:53,205 --> 00:31:55,028
to pick up the check and
I'm just sitting there,

636
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:58,414
drunk out of my mind,
processing this mistake.

637
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,991
He graciously continues to
offer me more time to pay

638
00:32:00,993 --> 00:32:04,413
but I don't even have
pocket change for this guy.

639
00:32:04,415 --> 00:32:08,395
So my drunk-ass self somehow
comes to the conclusion,

640
00:32:08,397 --> 00:32:11,101
my shirt costs the same as this meal.

641
00:32:11,103 --> 00:32:12,692
So I proceed to start striping...

642
00:32:12,694 --> 00:32:13,932
- Yes!
- And placing my shirt

643
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:15,230
in the middle of the table.

644
00:32:15,232 --> 00:32:19,084
Yes, yes!

645
00:32:19,086 --> 00:32:19,947
You good?

646
00:32:24,566 --> 00:32:26,483
When did we get here?

647
00:32:27,438 --> 00:32:28,899
What?

648
00:32:28,901 --> 00:32:29,734
When...

649
00:32:32,074 --> 00:32:35,194
You told that story already.

650
00:32:35,196 --> 00:32:36,029
Maybe.

651
00:32:36,878 --> 00:32:38,821
Have I told that story before?

652
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:40,168
Yeah, you did.

653
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:42,327
It was on this beach.

654
00:32:42,329 --> 00:32:44,496
Like, a couple nights ago.

655
00:32:46,144 --> 00:32:47,948
You sure you're not just a little drunk?

656
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:49,639
I mean, you've been hitting
that bottle pretty hard.

657
00:32:49,641 --> 00:32:52,454
Dude, 20 bucks says she's super high.

658
00:32:52,456 --> 00:32:55,142
You look super, like you're
floating on another planet.

659
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:59,144
Yeah, you pop a pill or
something before we got here?

660
00:32:59,146 --> 00:32:59,979
No.

661
00:33:04,169 --> 00:33:07,752
I don't remember what
happened before this.

662
00:33:09,684 --> 00:33:11,818
But this, this...

663
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,428
This happened, this already happened.

664
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:15,486
Maybe I have told that story before.

665
00:33:15,488 --> 00:33:17,921
All right, just a little deja vu.

666
00:33:17,923 --> 00:33:20,157
I like to hear the sound
of my own voice sometimes.

667
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:21,409
What can I say?

668
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:24,158
O-M-G, my dudes.

669
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,862
Jason texted me.

670
00:33:25,864 --> 00:33:26,832
I told you it was serious.

671
00:33:26,834 --> 00:33:28,159
Baby.

672
00:33:28,161 --> 00:33:28,992
Dude.

673
00:33:28,994 --> 00:33:30,804
It's time to go.

674
00:33:30,806 --> 00:33:31,637
This isn't happening.

675
00:33:31,639 --> 00:33:32,470
- This isn't happening.
- Hey, where you going?

676
00:33:32,472 --> 00:33:33,716
This isn't happening.

677
00:33:33,718 --> 00:33:34,837
This isn't happening.

678
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:36,006
You are worrying him.

679
00:33:36,008 --> 00:33:37,299
- No!
- Bella! Bella!

680
00:33:37,301 --> 00:33:39,052
Hey, what's going on, what's the matter?

681
00:33:39,054 --> 00:33:39,995
You can't run from this.

682
00:33:39,997 --> 00:33:41,223
Please don't let them get me.

683
00:33:41,225 --> 00:33:42,860
I got you, I got you.

684
00:33:45,925 --> 00:33:46,756
It's okay.

685
00:33:49,936 --> 00:33:51,008
You guys good?

686
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:52,486
Hey, look at me, look at me.

687
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:53,654
Hey.

688
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:56,393
I'm always gonna take care
of you, no matter what.

689
00:34:00,657 --> 00:34:02,431
Soon you're gonna be my
wife, so I can't have...

690
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:05,938
Are you gonna do that right now?

691
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,801
No.

692
00:34:06,803 --> 00:34:10,751
I'm gonna go
back here just in case.

693
00:34:12,095 --> 00:34:16,091
I'm always gonna take
care of you not matter what.

694
00:34:16,093 --> 00:34:17,489
I don't...

695
00:34:17,491 --> 00:34:18,324
Okay.

696
00:34:26,727 --> 00:34:28,560
We're gonna talk now

697
00:34:28,562 --> 00:34:31,884
and you're gonna answer my questions.

698
00:34:35,398 --> 00:34:36,866
Are you gonna hurt me?

699
00:34:36,868 --> 00:34:37,785
No.

700
00:34:41,751 --> 00:34:43,168
Are you ghosts?

701
00:34:44,141 --> 00:34:47,724
No.

702
00:34:49,928 --> 00:34:51,879
Am I going crazy?

703
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:52,798
No.

704
00:34:55,568 --> 00:34:56,401
Then...

705
00:34:57,962 --> 00:34:59,629
can you leave me be?

706
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:08,810
If I'm not going crazy and
you're not gonna hurt me,

707
00:35:10,036 --> 00:35:12,730
can you tell me what this is for?

708
00:35:12,732 --> 00:35:16,577
You already know.

709
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:19,195
Deep down you go.

710
00:35:19,197 --> 00:35:20,364
But I don't.

711
00:35:21,808 --> 00:35:25,111
So please just help me understand.

712
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:56,542
Hi, sweetie.

713
00:35:58,246 --> 00:36:00,567
I love you so much, okay?

714
00:36:00,569 --> 00:36:01,402
Karen?

715
00:36:03,927 --> 00:36:05,574
Can she hear me?

716
00:36:05,576 --> 00:36:07,909
I don't wanna say goodbye.

717
00:36:12,916 --> 00:36:14,916
I'm right here, Karen.

718
00:36:18,615 --> 00:36:19,446
Where is she?

719
00:36:19,448 --> 00:36:20,897
Karen, I'm here!

720
00:36:20,899 --> 00:36:21,768
Bella.

721
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:24,066
Karen, I'm right here!

722
00:36:24,068 --> 00:36:25,401
Bella.

723
00:36:26,383 --> 00:36:27,216
Mason?

724
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,242
Bella.

725
00:36:29,244 --> 00:36:30,930
Bella, wake up.

726
00:36:30,932 --> 00:36:33,078
Oh my God, all you do is sleep.

727
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:33,913
Get up!

728
00:36:35,466 --> 00:36:37,072
Finally.

729
00:36:37,074 --> 00:36:39,848
Come on, Frank said I can't
open any of my presents

730
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:41,267
until you're out.

731
00:36:44,588 --> 00:36:45,921
Your birthday?

732
00:36:47,597 --> 00:36:48,930
How old are you?

733
00:36:50,729 --> 00:36:52,229
Are you serious?

734
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,004
Wow.

735
00:36:57,821 --> 00:36:58,654
Whatever.

736
00:36:59,503 --> 00:37:01,420
I'll see you out there.

737
00:38:32,784 --> 00:38:34,156
About time you got up.

738
00:38:34,158 --> 00:38:35,741
Good morning, love.

739
00:38:36,628 --> 00:38:39,385
Oh, still in your PJs, I see.

740
00:38:39,387 --> 00:38:43,054
Luck for you, I don't
think Mason will care.

741
00:38:50,226 --> 00:38:52,153
You just wake up?

742
00:38:52,155 --> 00:38:54,466
I mean, you look great.

743
00:38:54,468 --> 00:38:55,301
Hey.

744
00:38:57,812 --> 00:38:58,909
Hey.

745
00:38:58,911 --> 00:39:00,185
Hey.

746
00:39:00,187 --> 00:39:01,020
You good?

747
00:39:02,526 --> 00:39:03,810
No.

748
00:39:03,812 --> 00:39:07,269
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

749
00:39:07,271 --> 00:39:10,657
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

750
00:39:10,659 --> 00:39:14,868
♪ Happy birthday dear Mason ♪

751
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:18,678
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

752
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,817
He's growing up so fast.

753
00:39:34,568 --> 00:39:35,399
You okay?

754
00:39:35,401 --> 00:39:37,567
You look a little sick.

755
00:39:37,569 --> 00:39:39,451
I'm not okay.

756
00:39:39,453 --> 00:39:40,368
Oh.

757
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:42,032
What's the matter?

758
00:39:42,034 --> 00:39:44,307
It's everything I told
you in the car before.

759
00:39:44,309 --> 00:39:45,142
What?

760
00:39:46,575 --> 00:39:49,242
What did you tell me in the car?

761
00:39:50,161 --> 00:39:52,064
In the car.

762
00:39:52,066 --> 00:39:53,976
After the beach.

763
00:39:53,978 --> 00:39:54,978
The beach?

764
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,534
Family beach day.

765
00:39:59,536 --> 00:40:01,786
When did all this happen?

766
00:40:03,905 --> 00:40:05,655
No, you were there.

767
00:40:07,028 --> 00:40:08,611
No, you were there.

768
00:40:10,601 --> 00:40:11,940
You aren't Adam.

769
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:12,891
You aren't Adam, you aren't real.

770
00:40:12,893 --> 00:40:14,738
- What are you talking about?
- Why the confusion?

771
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,889
No, you stop it!

772
00:40:15,891 --> 00:40:17,538
We aren't doing anything.

773
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,373
Shut up!

774
00:40:19,594 --> 00:40:20,544
I have a birthmark.

775
00:40:20,546 --> 00:40:21,592
Where is my birthmark, huh?

776
00:40:21,594 --> 00:40:23,069
It's on your left shoulder blade.

777
00:40:23,071 --> 00:40:24,062
What're you talking about?

778
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:25,293
Hey, Bella, Bella.

779
00:40:25,295 --> 00:40:28,807
Bella, didn't you have
something for Mason?

780
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:45,158
"Fearless."

781
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,180
Yeah, fearless.

782
00:40:47,182 --> 00:40:49,515
This looks so much like...

783
00:40:50,695 --> 00:40:51,528
Yeah.

784
00:40:54,186 --> 00:40:55,853
Thank you.

785
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,407
Are you even real?

786
00:41:09,707 --> 00:41:10,540
Uh...

787
00:41:11,486 --> 00:41:12,786
Could I cut this party short?

788
00:41:12,788 --> 00:41:14,615
I really wanna play my new video game.

789
00:41:14,617 --> 00:41:15,578
- Sure.
- Yes.

790
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,830
Yes, of course.

791
00:41:24,851 --> 00:41:28,601
It's quite a deep gift.

792
00:41:30,458 --> 00:41:32,875
I'm pretty sure her likes it.

793
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:38,603
All right, look,

794
00:41:38,605 --> 00:41:41,451
I don't know what all of this is about.

795
00:41:41,453 --> 00:41:42,953
Okay but I'm real.

796
00:41:44,622 --> 00:41:45,622
You're real.

797
00:41:49,296 --> 00:41:50,129
Okay?

798
00:41:52,992 --> 00:41:54,071
Can I get you anything?

799
00:41:54,073 --> 00:41:54,906
Water?

800
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,327
Yeah, water.

801
00:41:58,631 --> 00:41:59,464
Okay.

802
00:42:05,675 --> 00:42:08,228
She's confused.

803
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:10,204
Oh, can you just shut up?

804
00:42:10,206 --> 00:42:11,835
We can't.

805
00:42:11,837 --> 00:42:12,670
We're you.

806
00:42:13,539 --> 00:42:16,496
We can't leave until you do.

807
00:42:24,736 --> 00:42:25,569
Wait.

808
00:42:28,477 --> 00:42:29,644
Until I leave?

809
00:42:47,954 --> 00:42:50,037
Bella, can you hear me?

810
00:42:51,104 --> 00:42:53,021
Are you in there, Bell?

811
00:42:55,684 --> 00:42:57,587
So I can make this stop.

812
00:42:57,589 --> 00:42:58,827
I can make you leave.

813
00:42:58,829 --> 00:43:00,834
We leave when it's over.

814
00:43:00,836 --> 00:43:02,419
When what's over?

815
00:43:06,855 --> 00:43:08,105
When it's over.

816
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:11,220
We leave when you do.

817
00:43:12,304 --> 00:43:13,137
Are you?

818
00:43:33,613 --> 00:43:34,696
Take me back.

819
00:43:44,332 --> 00:43:45,783
No, no, no, no, no.

820
00:43:45,785 --> 00:43:46,618
No.

821
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:08,625
You fucking bastard!

822
00:44:08,627 --> 00:44:10,242
Oh, fuck.

823
00:44:17,728 --> 00:44:19,336
No.

824
00:44:27,634 --> 00:44:28,717
Take me back.

825
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:38,291
Take me back!

826
00:44:50,264 --> 00:44:51,097
Bella?

827
00:44:52,897 --> 00:44:54,268
Bell, are you okay?

828
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:55,412
I heard yelling.

829
00:44:55,414 --> 00:44:56,247
Fine.

830
00:44:58,490 --> 00:44:59,438
Bad dream?

831
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,857
Yep, bad dream.

832
00:45:02,452 --> 00:45:03,285
Oh.

833
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:08,140
Well, let me know if
you need anything, okay?

834
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:15,341
Hey, is she in her room?

835
00:45:15,343 --> 00:45:16,533
Yes.

836
00:45:16,535 --> 00:45:17,368
In bed.

837
00:45:19,515 --> 00:45:24,024
Good morning to you at
4:30 in the afternoon.

838
00:45:24,026 --> 00:45:25,852
All right, I need your advice.

839
00:45:25,854 --> 00:45:27,914
So, Jason texted me
about hanging out again

840
00:45:27,916 --> 00:45:29,281
and when I asked him what
or where we should go...

841
00:45:29,283 --> 00:45:31,554
Let's go for a walk.

842
00:45:31,556 --> 00:45:32,389
Um...

843
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:35,748
Walk carefully.

844
00:46:08,692 --> 00:46:10,908
One of my professors once told me

845
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:13,577
that our lives are just a dream.

846
00:46:15,354 --> 00:46:19,664
That those dreams

847
00:46:19,666 --> 00:46:23,210
are just a figment of
someone else's reality.

848
00:46:23,212 --> 00:46:24,708
We're not even alive.

849
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:29,207
We're just a figment of
someone else's imagination.

850
00:46:29,209 --> 00:46:30,721
Then he laughed and said,

851
00:46:30,723 --> 00:46:34,390
oh, it's fun to play
with bullshit theories.

852
00:46:36,537 --> 00:46:37,620
I don't know.

853
00:46:40,515 --> 00:46:42,930
Maybe he's not too far off.

854
00:46:42,932 --> 00:46:45,099
Wow, that's really deep.

855
00:46:48,269 --> 00:46:49,102
Maybe.

856
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:51,674
Maybe

857
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,309
it was all just a lie.

858
00:46:57,311 --> 00:46:58,764
What do you mean?

859
00:47:01,379 --> 00:47:03,428
Ugh, seriously?

860
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:05,326
People littering all over mother earth.

861
00:47:05,328 --> 00:47:07,240
It's disgusting.

862
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:42,441
Goddamn it!

863
00:47:44,165 --> 00:47:45,333
You leave when I do!

864
00:47:45,335 --> 00:47:48,671
That's what you said,
that's what you said!

865
00:47:48,673 --> 00:47:51,590
So just let me go and then you can.

866
00:47:54,712 --> 00:47:55,545
Why not?

867
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:00,340
You want me to die, right?

868
00:48:00,342 --> 00:48:01,877
That's what you wanted, right?

869
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:04,016
Enjoy what you have.

870
00:48:04,018 --> 00:48:06,080
It's not going to last.

871
00:48:06,082 --> 00:48:07,413
Be happy for now.

872
00:48:07,415 --> 00:48:09,475
Just let me go!

873
00:48:09,477 --> 00:48:10,426
Bella!

874
00:48:10,428 --> 00:48:11,743
Bella, what're you doing?

875
00:48:11,745 --> 00:48:12,722
Bella, stop!

876
00:48:12,724 --> 00:48:13,555
Stop!

877
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,762
Puke it up now!

878
00:48:14,764 --> 00:48:15,940
Puke it up!

879
00:48:19,312 --> 00:48:20,683
What did you do?

880
00:48:23,273 --> 00:48:24,753
Is it over?

881
00:48:24,755 --> 00:48:25,672
Is it over?

882
00:48:26,806 --> 00:48:28,456
I need someone to send help now!

883
00:48:28,458 --> 00:48:29,601
- They're gonna be gone.
- Please, I need help!

884
00:48:29,603 --> 00:48:30,762
They're gonna be gone.

885
00:48:30,764 --> 00:48:31,718
Please help me.

886
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:32,563
They're gonna be gone.

887
00:48:32,565 --> 00:48:33,654
They're gone.

888
00:48:33,656 --> 00:48:35,037
They're gonna be gone.

889
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:36,637
They're gonna be gone.

890
00:48:39,414 --> 00:48:41,247
They're gonna be gone.

891
00:49:05,858 --> 00:49:06,759
What do you want?

892
00:49:06,761 --> 00:49:07,592
What do you want?

893
00:49:07,594 --> 00:49:12,390
I've done everything, everything
that you've asked me to do!

894
00:49:12,392 --> 00:49:13,809
What do you want?

895
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:19,625
Okay, so maybe I'm panicking a little.

896
00:49:19,627 --> 00:49:20,887
Doctor is saying that

897
00:49:20,889 --> 00:49:22,010
- it's not looking...
- Kara?

898
00:49:22,012 --> 00:49:25,345
That great but we're still optimistic.

899
00:49:26,456 --> 00:49:29,833
Jeez, you really actually don't look good.

900
00:49:29,835 --> 00:49:32,656
But I'm here, we're all here.

901
00:49:32,658 --> 00:49:34,485
Not gonna leave you.

902
00:49:34,487 --> 00:49:35,911
You're my best friend.

903
00:49:35,913 --> 00:49:39,163
Can you please, please figure this out?

904
00:49:40,568 --> 00:49:41,401
Please?

905
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:46,383
Wait.

906
00:49:46,385 --> 00:49:47,622
Wait!

907
00:49:47,624 --> 00:49:48,457
Wait!

908
00:49:52,371 --> 00:49:53,202
Where have you been?

909
00:49:53,204 --> 00:49:55,121
We were about to leave.

910
00:49:57,946 --> 00:49:58,850
Hey!

911
00:49:58,852 --> 00:49:59,755
If you're gonna take those,

912
00:49:59,757 --> 00:50:03,174
at least help me carry one of these bags.

913
00:50:04,664 --> 00:50:05,497
The beach?

914
00:50:08,679 --> 00:50:10,512
It's family beach day.

915
00:50:12,852 --> 00:50:15,435
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

916
00:50:27,058 --> 00:50:28,895
Okay, handing
waters out, who wants a water?

917
00:50:28,897 --> 00:50:29,772
- Yes!
- Yes!

918
00:50:29,774 --> 00:50:31,218
- Yes, yes, who wants a water?
- Yes, please, thank you.

919
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:32,317
Mase, do you want a water?

920
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,071
I have one, yeah.

921
00:50:34,073 --> 00:50:35,527
Honey, do you
want one, you got one?

922
00:50:35,529 --> 00:50:36,360
I got water.

923
00:50:36,362 --> 00:50:37,193
Anyone want a banana?

924
00:50:37,195 --> 00:50:39,277
I have a half open banana,
does anyone want this?

925
00:50:39,279 --> 00:50:40,247
I don't think
I feel comfortable...

926
00:50:40,249 --> 00:50:42,385
No time for your pie, right there.

927
00:50:42,387 --> 00:50:43,939
Banana cream pie.

928
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:48,994
All right, talk to me.

929
00:50:48,996 --> 00:50:50,729
No, come on, what's going on up there?

930
00:50:50,731 --> 00:50:52,375
You're not even gonna remember.

931
00:50:52,377 --> 00:50:54,457
What're you talking about?

932
00:50:54,459 --> 00:50:57,340
That's exactly my fucking point.

933
00:50:57,342 --> 00:50:58,175
Okay.

934
00:50:59,738 --> 00:51:01,055
Okay, come on.

935
00:51:01,057 --> 00:51:02,051
No, come on, come on.

936
00:51:02,053 --> 00:51:02,884
No.

937
00:51:02,886 --> 00:51:04,840
What's your Aunt Karen doing?

938
00:51:04,842 --> 00:51:05,673
Stop!

939
00:51:05,675 --> 00:51:07,004
Wait, wait, put me down, right now!

940
00:51:07,006 --> 00:51:08,181
I'm not!

941
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:25,062
You don't want it?

942
00:51:35,652 --> 00:51:36,970
Oh my God!

943
00:51:37,805 --> 00:51:40,884
How did you not see that coming?

944
00:51:40,886 --> 00:51:42,682
You guys planned this, didn't you?

945
00:51:42,684 --> 00:51:43,515
Plan?

946
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:44,756
No, no, no, no planning.

947
00:51:44,758 --> 00:51:47,197
Light discussion but, yeah, we planned it.

948
00:51:49,201 --> 00:51:50,343
No, no, no, no, no!

949
00:52:10,202 --> 00:52:12,545
We should probably be heading home soon

950
00:52:12,547 --> 00:52:14,792
before it gets dark.

951
00:52:14,794 --> 00:52:16,294
It's a long drive.

952
00:52:18,387 --> 00:52:19,220
Oh.

953
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:26,028
You two remind me so much
of us when we were younger.

954
00:52:26,899 --> 00:52:28,980
Did I ever tell you the balcony story?

955
00:52:28,982 --> 00:52:30,341
- Oh.
- No, never heard it.

956
00:52:30,343 --> 00:52:31,225
What happened?

957
00:52:31,227 --> 00:52:33,229
When we were kids, her uncle,

958
00:52:33,231 --> 00:52:35,026
being the romantic that he is,

959
00:52:35,028 --> 00:52:38,954
would climb up the side of
my house, knock on my window,

960
00:52:38,956 --> 00:52:43,956
just to give me a little
flower before he went to bed.

961
00:52:44,275 --> 00:52:47,340
He was always as quiet as
possible so he wouldn't

962
00:52:47,342 --> 00:52:48,925
wake up my parents.

963
00:52:50,194 --> 00:52:51,409
One night...

964
00:52:51,411 --> 00:52:54,817
Yep, I wore the wrong climbing shoes.

965
00:52:54,819 --> 00:52:56,999
Slipped, fell off.

966
00:52:57,001 --> 00:52:59,038
Messed up my ankle.

967
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:02,213
I woke up the whole neighborhood.

968
00:53:02,215 --> 00:53:04,594
I'm glad you guys
don't have a two story...

969
00:53:04,596 --> 00:53:06,147
I think that we should be heading out.

970
00:53:06,149 --> 00:53:07,746
I'm getting a little tired.

971
00:53:07,748 --> 00:53:10,185
So can we meet you back?

972
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:12,354
Yeah, traffic and stuff.

973
00:53:22,061 --> 00:53:24,561
I am so sorry, that was close.

974
00:53:25,443 --> 00:53:26,560
I saw it coming.

975
00:53:26,562 --> 00:53:27,645
Mmmm, so...

976
00:53:28,695 --> 00:53:29,604
Feeling better?

977
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:30,539
Yeah.

978
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:32,157
What was all that about?

979
00:53:32,159 --> 00:53:34,177
Doesn't even matter.

980
00:53:34,179 --> 00:53:35,425
I'm just excited for tomorrow.

981
00:53:35,427 --> 00:53:36,677
Yeah, me too.

982
00:53:37,815 --> 00:53:38,840
What's tomorrow?

983
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:42,626
Actually, nothing really of importance.

984
00:53:42,628 --> 00:53:43,621
Ah.

985
00:53:43,623 --> 00:53:46,566
I'm gonna be with family,
I'm gonna be with you.

986
00:53:46,568 --> 00:53:48,185
It's gonna be a new day.

987
00:53:48,187 --> 00:53:51,223
I'm looking forward to the future.

988
00:53:51,225 --> 00:53:52,773
The future?

989
00:53:52,775 --> 00:53:53,606
Yeah.

990
00:53:53,608 --> 00:53:55,369
I've been thinking a
lot about the future.

991
00:53:55,371 --> 00:53:56,257
Oh, really?

992
00:53:56,259 --> 00:53:57,592
Really.

993
00:53:58,677 --> 00:53:59,760
What about?

994
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:08,416
Adam Ray Colton, you
are not proposing to me

995
00:54:08,418 --> 00:54:10,405
- in the freaking street.
- Bella Diana Lana.

996
00:54:11,901 --> 00:54:13,401
- No.
- Will you...

997
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:15,917
Please help me get this
kink out of my neck?

998
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:16,750
Oh my Gosh!

999
00:54:16,752 --> 00:54:18,412
It's been bugging me all day, what?

1000
00:54:18,414 --> 00:54:19,245
Oh, you didn't actually think

1001
00:54:19,247 --> 00:54:20,553
I was gonna propose in the
middle of the street, right?

1002
00:54:20,555 --> 00:54:21,386
You're a dick.

1003
00:54:21,388 --> 00:54:22,354
Am I that low on your scale?

1004
00:54:22,356 --> 00:54:23,303
You're only getting lower.

1005
00:54:23,305 --> 00:54:25,100
Ugh.

1006
00:54:25,102 --> 00:54:25,933
You took that personally,

1007
00:54:25,935 --> 00:54:27,008
- that's on you.
- Yeah, I did.

1008
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:28,847
I had the best of intentions.

1009
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:37,346
You tired?

1010
00:54:37,348 --> 00:54:39,059
- You want me to drive?
- No.

1011
00:54:39,061 --> 00:54:41,057
Not even a little tired.

1012
00:54:41,059 --> 00:54:44,466
- You look a little...
- No, I'm fine.

1013
00:54:44,468 --> 00:54:46,718
You know I love you, right?

1014
00:54:47,889 --> 00:54:49,750
Yeah, of course.

1015
00:54:49,752 --> 00:54:51,002
I love you too.

1016
00:54:53,399 --> 00:54:55,216
You can't figure this.

1017
00:54:55,218 --> 00:54:56,934
Don't fight this.

1018
00:54:56,936 --> 00:54:58,133
Especially now.

1019
00:54:58,135 --> 00:54:59,637
- Don't fight this moment.
- No.

1020
00:54:59,639 --> 00:55:01,385
- What that a cop?
- No, no, it's fine.

1021
00:55:01,387 --> 00:55:02,554
It's fine.

1022
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:06,476
Stop!

1023
00:55:06,478 --> 00:55:07,938
Don't!

1024
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:09,964
I'm not going back.

1025
00:55:09,966 --> 00:55:11,591
Close your eyes.

1026
00:55:11,593 --> 00:55:12,922
I'm not going back!

1027
00:55:16,111 --> 00:55:17,371
She's lost too much blood.

1028
00:55:17,373 --> 00:55:18,451
Not breathing.

1029
00:55:18,453 --> 00:55:19,538
Started CPR.

1030
00:55:28,043 --> 00:55:29,543
That car hit us.

1031
00:55:32,473 --> 00:55:33,306
And...

1032
00:55:39,851 --> 00:55:40,684
Am I?

1033
00:55:43,299 --> 00:55:45,517
No, you hit the curb.

1034
00:56:00,769 --> 00:56:02,269
It's a hospital.

1035
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:10,570
We can do it.

1036
00:56:11,481 --> 00:56:12,898
You stay with us.

1037
00:56:14,519 --> 00:56:18,415
Don't even think about
going anywhere, Bell.

1038
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:20,343
You be here, all right?

1039
00:56:20,345 --> 00:56:22,383
You stay with us.

1040
00:56:26,677 --> 00:56:28,094
No, no, no, no.

1041
00:56:30,524 --> 00:56:31,941
That wasn't real.

1042
00:56:35,252 --> 00:56:36,085
This...

1043
00:56:38,796 --> 00:56:39,879
This is real.

1044
00:56:40,929 --> 00:56:43,762
We wanted you to be happy.

1045
00:56:48,853 --> 00:56:49,686
Dreams.

1046
00:56:50,817 --> 00:56:51,650
My memory.

1047
00:56:53,248 --> 00:56:56,165
What happened to my other memories?

1048
00:56:57,465 --> 00:56:59,558
How do I get back?

1049
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,085
How do I wake up?

1050
00:57:01,087 --> 00:57:02,433
So, as per your request,

1051
00:57:02,435 --> 00:57:04,392
we are going to stop
the machine momentarily

1052
00:57:04,394 --> 00:57:07,383
in order to see if her body's
able to breathe on its own.

1053
00:57:07,385 --> 00:57:10,637
If she is able to breathe, then
we can keep the machine off.

1054
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:12,070
But if she's unable to,

1055
00:57:12,072 --> 00:57:15,204
then we will have to start
the machine immediately.

1056
00:57:15,206 --> 00:57:18,269
Just to double check,
do you wish to proceed?

1057
00:57:18,271 --> 00:57:20,101
Wait, what?

1058
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:20,936
Yes.

1059
00:57:21,831 --> 00:57:23,559
I'm right here!

1060
00:57:45,179 --> 00:57:47,762
She isn't breathing.

1061
00:58:17,598 --> 00:58:19,015
Please hear me.

1062
00:58:39,025 --> 00:58:40,793
We are you.

1063
00:58:40,795 --> 00:58:44,233
Your thoughts, your imagination.

1064
00:58:44,235 --> 00:58:48,052
You created us to protect
yourself from the truth.

1065
00:58:48,887 --> 00:58:51,681
We are not in control of your future.

1066
00:58:51,683 --> 00:58:54,016
I don't wanna die.

1067
00:58:56,469 --> 00:58:57,886
We're all here.

1068
00:59:01,766 --> 00:59:03,349
It's gonna be okay.

1069
00:59:06,845 --> 00:59:07,712
Please.

1070
00:59:07,714 --> 00:59:09,701
What can I do to make them hear me?

1071
00:59:21,726 --> 00:59:22,893
Bella!

1072
00:59:22,895 --> 00:59:24,145
Bella, wake up!

1073
00:59:25,326 --> 00:59:27,813
Oh my God, all you do is sleep.

1074
00:59:27,815 --> 00:59:28,648
Get up.

1075
00:59:31,852 --> 00:59:32,685
Finally.

1076
00:59:34,926 --> 00:59:36,534
Your birthday, huh?

1077
00:59:36,536 --> 00:59:38,510
What're you even turning now?

1078
00:59:38,512 --> 00:59:40,065
Not even dating age, right?

1079
00:59:40,067 --> 00:59:41,142
That sucks.

1080
00:59:41,144 --> 00:59:43,159
Well, actually, I've
been going out with a girl

1081
00:59:43,161 --> 00:59:46,161
for a couple of weeks now, so, yeah.

1082
00:59:47,263 --> 00:59:48,096
Really?

1083
00:59:51,267 --> 00:59:52,184
Oh, crap.

1084
00:59:53,149 --> 00:59:55,024
Please don't tell Aunt
Karen because if you do,

1085
00:59:55,026 --> 00:59:58,952
she'll never let me hear the end of it.

1086
00:59:58,954 --> 01:00:00,970
Okay, okay, I won't tell her

1087
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:04,375
but you tell me about
the lucky lady, okay?

1088
01:00:04,377 --> 01:00:05,210
Fine.

1089
01:00:20,035 --> 01:00:21,118
I love you.

1090
01:00:24,038 --> 01:00:26,038
I wish I said that more.

1091
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:32,190
I wish we went all those
places we talked about.

1092
01:00:34,154 --> 01:00:36,821
I wish I was more serious but...

1093
01:00:38,330 --> 01:00:40,997
I just wanted to make you laugh.

1094
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:45,763
I just wanted to see you smile.

1095
01:00:48,016 --> 01:00:51,016
I wish I met you when I was younger.

1096
01:00:53,515 --> 01:00:56,598
I wish I could've grown old with you.

1097
01:00:59,338 --> 01:01:02,838
I wish I could hold you tight every night.

1098
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:09,667
Most of all, I wish I
could've called you my wife.

1099
01:01:11,096 --> 01:01:14,596
But it looks like I won't get that chance.

1100
01:01:16,349 --> 01:01:17,182
So,

1101
01:01:21,433 --> 01:01:23,100
for what it's worth,

1102
01:01:29,347 --> 01:01:30,847
I love you, Bella.

1103
01:01:35,338 --> 01:01:38,421
I'll see you on the other side, okay?

1104
01:01:51,178 --> 01:01:53,394
About time you got up.

1105
01:01:53,396 --> 01:01:54,592
Good morning, love.

1106
01:01:54,594 --> 01:01:56,511
Good morning.

1107
01:01:57,661 --> 01:01:58,728
You just wake up?

1108
01:01:58,730 --> 01:02:00,217
Don't I look great?

1109
01:02:00,219 --> 01:02:01,219
Fantastic.

1110
01:02:02,971 --> 01:02:06,391
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

1111
01:02:06,393 --> 01:02:07,224
Actually.

01:02:07,226 --> 01:02:09,700
♪ Happy ♪

1113
01:02:09,702 --> 01:02:12,259
Can we do gifts first?

1114
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:13,517
Sure.

1115
01:02:13,519 --> 01:02:14,352
Cool.

1116
01:02:15,376 --> 01:02:17,014
Hey, come here.

1117
01:02:24,808 --> 01:02:27,066
Read what it says.

1118
01:02:27,068 --> 01:02:28,221
"Fearless."

1119
01:02:28,223 --> 01:02:29,622
Yeah.

1120
01:02:29,624 --> 01:02:32,900
Mom and Dad got that for
me when I was little.

1121
01:02:32,902 --> 01:02:34,411
I lost it.

1122
01:02:34,413 --> 01:02:36,913
Never had a chance to wear it.

1123
01:02:38,230 --> 01:02:43,051
But I really think that they
would've wanted you to have it.

1124
01:02:43,053 --> 01:02:45,303
So if you're ever scared or

1125
01:02:47,145 --> 01:02:48,645
if you feel alone,

1126
01:02:51,308 --> 01:02:54,391
just remember that you have it, okay?

1127
01:03:11,618 --> 01:03:12,451
So,

1128
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:14,553
memories.

1129
01:03:16,652 --> 01:03:17,485
Dreams.

1130
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:23,006
That's what they were this whole time.

1131
01:03:27,033 --> 01:03:32,033
You knew all along.

1132
01:03:47,052 --> 01:03:50,969
But I clearly wanted
to know the truth again.

1133
01:03:52,571 --> 01:03:55,171
Why didn't you tell me?

1134
01:03:55,173 --> 01:03:56,590
You knew.

1135
01:04:11,825 --> 01:04:13,158
Can I go back?

1136
01:04:15,097 --> 01:04:18,764
To dreaming?

1137
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,010
You were right.

1138
01:04:22,676 --> 01:04:24,176
I'm happier there.

1139
01:04:25,507 --> 01:04:27,258
That is your choice.

1140
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:29,524
Do what makes you happy.

1141
01:04:29,526 --> 01:04:31,109
You are in control.

1142
01:04:36,026 --> 01:04:38,013
And I'm just sitting
there drunk out of my mind,

1143
01:04:38,015 --> 01:04:39,796
processing this mistake.

1144
01:04:39,798 --> 01:04:42,742
He graciously continues to
offer me more time to pay

1145
01:04:42,744 --> 01:04:45,843
but I don't even have
pocket change for this guy.

1146
01:04:45,845 --> 01:04:49,336
So my drunk-ass self somehow
comes to the conclusion,

1147
01:04:49,338 --> 01:04:51,583
my shirt costs the same as this meal.

1148
01:04:51,585 --> 01:04:53,615
So I proceed to start striping,

1149
01:04:53,617 --> 01:04:57,037
placing my shirt in the
middle of this table.

1150
01:04:57,039 --> 01:04:58,421
Oh, this poor waiter.

1151
01:04:58,423 --> 01:04:59,935
I wasn't going out to the gym.

1152
01:04:59,937 --> 01:05:01,382
I mean, it was all bad.

1153
01:05:01,384 --> 01:05:02,801
Not a good scene.

1154
01:05:11,125 --> 01:05:13,604
Whoa, what's all this about?

1155
01:05:13,606 --> 01:05:14,845
Sorry.

1156
01:05:14,847 --> 01:05:16,430
I just, I love you.

1157
01:05:18,604 --> 01:05:20,604
Ugh, here we go again.

1158
01:05:24,709 --> 01:05:28,116
Why did you wait so long to propose?

1159
01:05:28,118 --> 01:05:31,445
You think I waited too long?

1160
01:05:31,447 --> 01:05:32,685
I could change that.

1161
01:05:33,864 --> 01:05:34,854
Oh God.

1162
01:05:34,856 --> 01:05:36,739
Oh my God, it's happening right now.

1163
01:05:36,741 --> 01:05:37,957
Oh, wait, Kara!

1164
01:05:37,959 --> 01:05:40,852
No, you keep going,
don't you ruin this moment.

1165
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:42,006
Keep going.

1166
01:05:46,284 --> 01:05:47,701
Please be okay.

1167
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:02,560
No, I have two memories left.

1168
01:06:02,562 --> 01:06:04,709
I wanna see them.

1169
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:06,211
It's time.

1170
01:06:08,358 --> 01:06:09,691
You can feel it.

1171
01:06:12,335 --> 01:06:14,335
I don't wanna die yet.

1172
01:06:19,419 --> 01:06:22,336
Well, how do you know she's gone?

1173
01:06:23,352 --> 01:06:26,474
We ran an EEG, as you know.

1174
01:06:26,476 --> 01:06:27,507
But unfortunately,

1175
01:06:27,509 --> 01:06:30,576
there's only a small
amount of brain activity

1176
01:06:30,578 --> 01:06:33,761
which, unfortunately, is
considered brain dead.

1177
01:06:33,763 --> 01:06:35,930
So you'll have a decision.

1178
01:06:36,965 --> 01:06:37,798
So,

1179
01:06:39,570 --> 01:06:42,487
we need to decide if we wanna stop?

1180
01:06:43,372 --> 01:06:47,955
When, it'd be when you'd
like to stop the ventilator.

1181
01:06:51,637 --> 01:06:53,720
Will she feel any pain?

1182
01:06:56,415 --> 01:07:00,320
Hey, we're gonna take
great care of her, okay?

1183
01:07:00,322 --> 01:07:02,182
I'm gonna give her a
medication to make sure

1184
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:04,264
she's as comfortable as she can be.

1185
01:07:04,266 --> 01:07:06,567
Now, the morphine will take away any pain.

1186
01:07:06,569 --> 01:07:11,569
It will remove any feelings
of air hunger if she...

1187
01:07:11,624 --> 01:07:14,624
Look, folks, it is impossible to say

1188
01:07:15,905 --> 01:07:17,687
if there's anybody in there anymore

1189
01:07:17,689 --> 01:07:18,975
but to be on the safe side,

1190
01:07:18,977 --> 01:07:21,442
we will make sure that she is comfortable.

1191
01:07:21,444 --> 01:07:23,535
It's just that we don't know
if she's really in there.

1192
01:07:23,537 --> 01:07:27,086
We don't know what happens
before someone passes away

1193
01:07:27,088 --> 01:07:29,088
but we will do our best.

1194
01:07:48,983 --> 01:07:53,150
She just looks
so much like your sister.

1195
01:07:54,636 --> 01:07:56,469
Looks of her mother.

1196
01:07:57,667 --> 01:07:59,500
Sarcasm of her father.

1197
01:08:04,391 --> 01:08:06,058
Wherever they are,

1198
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:10,083
I know you'll see them soon.

1199
01:08:26,522 --> 01:08:27,355
Well,

1200
01:08:30,491 --> 01:08:31,324
when...

1201
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:36,183
When you said

1202
01:08:37,854 --> 01:08:42,521
if I was having a bad dream
I could put on the necklace.

1203
01:08:46,531 --> 01:08:49,614
Without you, I would have no backbone

1204
01:08:51,047 --> 01:08:52,547
through this time.

1205
01:08:55,897 --> 01:08:58,230
I would have no one to help,

1206
01:09:00,004 --> 01:09:02,421
no one to give me any sanity.

1207
01:09:08,756 --> 01:09:10,339
I'm gonna miss you.

1208
01:09:12,251 --> 01:09:14,418
I'm gonna miss you a lot.

1209
01:09:42,667 --> 01:09:44,334
You be fearless too.

1210
01:10:00,722 --> 01:10:01,805
Hey, Bella.

1211
01:10:08,172 --> 01:10:09,339
You're okay.

1212
01:10:13,826 --> 01:10:15,409
Adam, I'm so sorry.

1213
01:10:19,599 --> 01:10:23,849
I know you think that I
took too long to propose.

1214
01:10:28,053 --> 01:10:30,169
For what it's worth...

1215
01:10:51,367 --> 01:10:52,450
I love you.

1216
01:10:59,116 --> 01:11:00,199
I love you.

1217
01:11:07,114 --> 01:11:08,531
I dumped Jason.

1218
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:15,730
You were always right, Bella, you know.

1219
01:11:17,657 --> 01:11:19,240
He was such a tool.

1220
01:11:30,430 --> 01:11:33,080
I'm sure we can
remove some of the bandages

1221
01:11:33,082 --> 01:11:35,082
so you can see her face.

1222
01:12:30,337 --> 01:12:31,670
I am fearless.

1223
01:12:44,308 --> 01:12:46,725
You're all in my head, right?

1224
01:12:49,409 --> 01:12:52,242
So I can make you whatever I want.

1225
01:12:53,265 --> 01:12:54,098
Right?

1226
01:12:58,050 --> 01:13:02,555
I don't need to protect
myself from the truth anymore.

1227
01:13:56,628 --> 01:13:58,558
Please, just let her go.

1228
01:13:58,560 --> 01:13:59,391
You,

1229
01:13:59,393 --> 01:14:00,291
kid.

1230
01:14:00,293 --> 01:14:01,852
Necklace!

1231
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:03,790
Take it off now!

1232
01:14:03,792 --> 01:14:05,025
Bring it over here!

1233
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:10,638
I said valuables!

1234
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:13,077
Stop wasting my fucking time!

1235
01:14:13,079 --> 01:14:15,230
Wedding ring, take it off,
toss it over here now!

1236
01:14:15,232 --> 01:14:16,349
Okay.

1237
01:14:16,351 --> 01:14:17,578
Here.

1238
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:18,630
Here.

1239
01:14:18,632 --> 01:14:19,463
Please.

1240
01:14:19,465 --> 01:14:21,079
She can't breathe.

1241
01:14:21,081 --> 01:14:22,664
Let her go, please.

1242
01:14:23,563 --> 01:14:26,235
You can have anything you want.

1243
01:14:26,237 --> 01:14:28,167
Don't do something you might regret.

1244
01:14:28,169 --> 01:14:31,263
You think you're in any
position to tell me what to do?

1245
01:14:31,265 --> 01:14:33,201
You have five minutes, you hear me?

1246
01:14:33,203 --> 01:14:37,239
Five minute to gather all
the valuables in this house.

1247
01:14:37,241 --> 01:14:38,408
Cash, jewellery.

1248
01:14:39,559 --> 01:14:40,392
Now.

1249
01:14:41,746 --> 01:14:42,758
Fucking now!

1250
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:43,591
No!

1251
01:14:43,593 --> 01:14:44,599
Shut up!

1252
01:14:47,210 --> 01:14:48,495
No.

1253
01:14:48,497 --> 01:14:50,414
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1254
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:52,091
No.

1255
01:14:55,511 --> 01:14:57,261
It's okay, it's okay.

1256
01:14:59,054 --> 01:15:00,137
I'm so sorry.

1257
01:15:04,698 --> 01:15:06,781
I told you not to move.

1258
01:15:17,361 --> 01:15:18,192
Shit.

1259
01:15:34,979 --> 01:15:35,824
What?

1260
01:15:35,826 --> 01:15:37,159
What have you...

1261
01:15:40,519 --> 01:15:42,342
What have you done?

1262
01:15:42,344 --> 01:15:44,880
No, don't.

1263
01:15:55,109 --> 01:15:55,970
Hands up!

1264
01:15:55,972 --> 01:15:57,411
Drop the gun!

1265
01:15:57,413 --> 01:15:59,317
Drop the gun now!

1266
01:15:59,319 --> 01:16:00,902
Drop the gun now!

1267
01:16:02,386 --> 01:16:03,467
This is Officer Green

1268
01:16:03,469 --> 01:16:05,486
requesting immediate backup.

1269
01:16:05,488 --> 01:16:07,467
Put your hands up!

1270
01:16:07,469 --> 01:16:08,719
Drop the gun.

1271
01:16:10,492 --> 01:16:13,100
- Sir.
- You son of a bitch!

1272
01:16:13,102 --> 01:16:15,246
You fucking bastard.

1273
01:16:41,628 --> 01:16:42,461
Mom?

1274
01:16:45,163 --> 01:16:45,996
Dad?

1275
01:16:48,731 --> 01:16:50,898
I missed you guys so much.

1276
01:16:51,782 --> 01:16:53,615
We love you so much.
