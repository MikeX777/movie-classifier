1
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,875
I can't believe we
gotta do this shit, man.

2
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,544
This thing's been in the
ground three fuckin' months.

3
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,780
- You know what it's gonna smell like?
- Yeah, I know.

4
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:50,015
Stop bitching and let's just
get this thing outta here.

5
00:00:53,385 --> 00:00:56,956
I remember about 10 years
ago, I had to do the same shit.

6
00:00:56,957 --> 00:01:00,358
I almost died from
the fucking stench.

7
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:02,629
Oh, God.

8
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,863
Here.

9
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:09,269
All right. Let's do this.

10
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:25,717
Oh, fuck. I'm gonna
break my neck out here.

11
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:33,825
- Hey, Danny. How much further?
- Not far... just keep walking.

12
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,733
- What the fuck?
- What is that?

13
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:43,436
Do you think some kind of animal
or something could have did this?

14
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:45,705
How the fuck is an animal
gonna dig a hole like that?

15
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:47,461
Louie, gimme that
flashlight. Carmine.

16
00:01:47,487 --> 00:01:49,042
- What?
- Come here.

17
00:01:49,043 --> 00:01:52,410
Go down and see if
there is anything there.

18
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,646
- Cock.
- Thank you.

19
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,852
Louie, help me out. I'm
not a fucking kangaroo.

20
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:06,025
There ain't nothing down here.
And I don't smell nothing neither.

21
00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:09,095
Really, Carmine? You don't
smell a rat down there?

22
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,900
- Big "V" sends his regards.
- Louie! Louie, Louie, Louie!

23
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:25,710
Let's bury the rat and just
get the fuck outta here.

24
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:29,882
I don't even know
where the fuck we are.

25
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,118
Why'd we have to come all
the way out here to do this?

26
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:35,054
We've been burying pricks
like this out here for years.

27
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:38,658
If these woods could only
talk, we'd all be in the can.

28
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:11,924
Who's over there?

29
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:14,761
Danny, look out!

30
00:03:14,762 --> 00:03:16,396
Danny, no!

31
00:05:22,054 --> 00:05:24,123
That is so pretty,
you're gonna look so hot.

32
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,160
Pull it down, you don't wanna
give away the milk for free.

33
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,862
It'll get so much
lighter with the sun.

34
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:32,164
You have such a
nice butt, like J.Lo.

35
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,035
Right here.

36
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:48,548
- Can somebody pick up the phone?
- Why don't you answer the phone, bitch?

37
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:49,982
Don't you dare call her bitch.

38
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:52,885
I'll shove this curling iron right
up your fat fucking ass, bitch.

39
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,919
I'll get the phone.

40
00:06:00,092 --> 00:06:04,263
A Touch of Class, Teresa speaking.
Hold on... Ricardo.

41
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:08,601
It's for you. He says
that his name is Monty.

42
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:09,602
Ugh.

43
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,242
Excuse me. Who do you think
you are, calling me at work?

44
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:21,912
Oh, no, and don't ever call me
again! Yech! <i> Ay, Dios mio.</i>

45
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,784
- I like this outfit...
- Who's Monty?

46
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:28,787
Oh, some pig I met online last night.
We were chatting for just 10 minutes

47
00:06:28,813 --> 00:06:31,857
and he expects me to drive
to his place at 1:00 a.m.

48
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,794
I said, "No, you can't
just pick up the phone

49
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:38,664
"and send for me in the middle of the night.
What do you think I am, Pizza Slut?"

50
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:42,001
<i>Mira</i>, I have a picture of the slob.

51
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:43,703
- Ugh.
- Is it the full Monty?

52
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:44,870
Yeah, that's the pig.

53
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:49,409
He's cute. Should have called
me last night. I deliver.

54
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,978
Listen, honey, unless
your pizza has pepperoni,

55
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:53,946
don't even bother
heating up your oven.

56
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:57,717
Come on, Dina. I want
to beat the traffic.

57
00:06:57,718 --> 00:07:00,386
All done. Let me
just get my things.

58
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:02,688
Where the hell are you two going?

59
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:05,625
Down the shore for a girls'
weekend of sun and sin.

60
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,894
Maybe the two of
youse can either drown

61
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:11,831
or get eaten by a shark and
make it a holiday for all of us.

62
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:15,735
Heh, or who knows? Maybe we'll find a
beached whale and name her Christy.

63
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:19,839
Oh, sounds like fun. And while
you're looking for Mr. Right,

64
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,174
Dina can sample all
the Mr. Right Nows.

65
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,877
You said it, not me.

66
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:26,912
- Whatever.
- I'm out of here.

67
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,781
I just kidding...
you know you fabulous.

68
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:32,918
- You look so pretty. You look so good.
- I tell her that every time.

69
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,787
It's like a shelf up here.
They just hold up.

70
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,055
I don't know how she does it.

71
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:38,658
- I made it!
- Hey!

72
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:39,959
- Mwah!
- Hey!

73
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,162
- Oh, you're not working today, Gigi.
- You got that right.

74
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:46,732
Oh, chica, you too? Wait, am
I the only girl not going?

75
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:50,936
- Next time, we'll invite you, I promise.
- What am I gonna do this weekend?

76
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,204
- Aww.
- I don't know.

77
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,106
Maybe you should ask Monty.

78
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:57,743
You get out of here,
you... Good-bye.

79
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,016
Hello, Monty?

80
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,752
Yes, I'll taste your chorizo.

81
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:10,256
Come on!

82
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:12,358
Come on, Gigi, let's go!

83
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:14,994
All right, Dina, she's
coming, she's coming.

84
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,430
Come on, Gigi, we want
to beat the traffic.

85
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:20,431
Okay, Seaside
Heights, here we come!

86
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,469
Michael, what are you doing here?

87
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,706
I was just driving by, and I saw your
mother drop you off. Where you going?

88
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:29,709
Not that it's any of your business, but I'm
going down the shore to see the girls.

89
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,044
Well, I might be there too. So
maybe we should all hook up.

90
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:33,779
That is so not happening, Michael.

91
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,782
I just don't want you going down the
shore with a car full of single girls.

92
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:38,784
Would you rather I go in
a car full of single guys?

93
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:42,021
Don't be stupid, Gigi, you know you're
still my girl. Show me a little love.

94
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:45,291
It's not happening, Michael! Now, go
do something with Tony and Fat Angelo,

95
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:47,327
- and I'll call you on Monday.
- So it's like that?

96
00:08:47,328 --> 00:08:50,196
- Yeah, Michael, it's exactly like that!
- Yeah, it's like that.

97
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,765
- Dina!
- What... he's a dick.

98
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:54,366
- Dina!
- Hey, fuck you, Dina!

99
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:58,871
Yeah, fuck all youse! You're gonna regret
this day, Gigi. Remember I said that.

100
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,140
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Means drop dead!

101
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:03,508
Fuck off, Michael!

102
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:10,850
- What the fuck, Gigi?
- I don't know.

103
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:12,485
I don't know what the
fuck I'm doing anymore.

104
00:09:12,486 --> 00:09:15,488
I mean, one minute, I think
I love him, and then the next,

105
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:18,057
I wanna knock his fucking head
off and throw it in the river.

106
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:21,293
- Like right now?
- Yes, I think so.

107
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:24,130
But he really is sweet,
though, don't youse think?

108
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:26,599
- So are you single or what?
- Yeah, right now, I am.

109
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,768
You don't see no fucking
ring on my finger, do you?

110
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:30,970
No, but if you really
think that there's a chance

111
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:34,373
for you and Michael, don't go hooking
up with every guy in New Jersey

112
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:36,342
just to prove to
yourself you're single.

113
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:37,843
Fuck you, Dina!

114
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:39,879
No, no, no, no,
no... I'm with Gigi.

115
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,281
Until you're married, you
do whatever the hell you want

116
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:45,032
with whoever the hell you want,
whenever the hell you want,

117
00:09:45,058 --> 00:09:47,954
'cause guess what, Teresa?
Life's just too fuckin' short.

118
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:51,557
Okay... next topic. When are the
girls meeting us down in Seaside?

119
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:55,790
Uh, Joanne said that she, Candi, and
Val left Brooklyn almost an hour ago,

120
00:09:55,816 --> 00:09:59,231
and that Val's cousin Rosemarie
can't make it till tomorrow night.

121
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:03,235
So in other words, they could
have stopped for hot dogs.

122
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:05,704
Or they're banging three
guidos at a turnpike rest stop.

123
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,838
Eww.

124
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,478
Oh, my God, speak of
the fucking devil.

125
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,816
- Almost fucking killed us.
- Oh, my God.

126
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:21,287
You should have seen the old man's face
at the toll booth. He was so funny, ha!

127
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:25,524
- Put your tops back on and follow us.
- Yeah, Jersey Shore!

128
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:08,167
Are you sure this is
the right house, Dina?

129
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,601
Yeah, I'm fuckin' sure.

130
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:14,438
Come on.

131
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:18,177
Hello? What do you think
you're doing here?

132
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,013
Excuse me? This is our rental.

133
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,482
- What are you doing here?
- Nice try, chonga.

134
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:27,019
This is our house, so get the hell out.
Take your little rat dog with you.

135
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,221
Who are you calling chonga, <i>bruja?</i>

136
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:31,624
Don't be scared, Pico.
I won't let her eat you.

137
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:35,928
I'm calling all of youse chonga. And
I'm calling the owner right now.

138
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:40,466
You no have to call, okay? He lives right
there, and I just gave him our check.

139
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:42,468
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

140
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:46,570
We'll see about that. Girls.

141
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,054
Well... Hello there, ladies.

142
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,590
I'm Ronnie... what
can I do you for?

143
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:06,458
Yeah, Ronnie, we spoke
on the phone a month ago

144
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,261
to confirm our reservation for
the house this weekend.

145
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:13,599
Oh, yeah! Your friend just gave
me a check, so we're cool.

146
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,403
- Romero, right?
- No... Romano.

147
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,405
Dina Romano, you idiot.

148
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:23,075
Romano. You're not all together?

149
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:26,412
Uh, give me a minute. Don't
go away... hold on, just wait.

150
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,846
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

151
00:12:36,521 --> 00:12:41,160
Here it is. You're Romano.
They're Romero.

152
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:43,095
<i>♪ Romano, Romero, Romano ♪</i>

153
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:47,599
You're two different parties.
That explains everything.

154
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,801
Fine... so can you get those
chongas out of our house,

155
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:52,338
so we can finally
shower and unpack?

156
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:56,599
I'm afraid I can't do that,
and here's why. You see,

157
00:12:56,625 --> 00:13:01,313
I already gave them the keys, and
then now they take over the house.

158
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:04,249
That's the law. See, the house
is not mine, it's theirs.

159
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,152
I know it's a little peculiar, but
it's how they do it in Jersey.

160
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:10,656
Now that every house and hotel are
booked, where are we supposed to go?

161
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:14,193
Nice going, Ronnie. You
managed to fuck us all.

162
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:17,296
Hold on... hold on, hold on. Why don't
you guys just stay here with me?

163
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,731
Excuse me?

164
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,258
Look, I can find ways of keeping
you girls reasonably...

165
00:13:25,284 --> 00:13:29,241
- entertained.
- Ugh!

166
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:33,778
I'll take that as a no. Or
I'll take it as a maybe.

167
00:13:34,913 --> 00:13:39,617
Their loss. Okay,
pot, it's you and me.

168
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:48,694
That bitch think she's better than me
just because she has fake tits. Huh!

169
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:53,465
I don't speak Mexican or Puerto Rican, but
I know they definitely talking about us.

170
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:55,067
Fuckin' nightmare.

171
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:58,370
Hold on a second.
I'll be right back.

172
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:02,241
If that chonga gives me one more look,
I swear, I'm gonna fuck her up.

173
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:04,810
Who would believe that someone
could screw something up so bad?

174
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:08,480
- Are you trying to say this is my fault?
- Well, whose fault is it?

175
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:17,455
Oh, my God, your little fucking rat
dog just pissed on my fucking leg!

176
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:23,195
Thanks for telling me. I gotta go
now and disinfect his pee pee.

177
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:27,299
Oh, my God, you're the best!
Thank you! Thank you!

178
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,334
Uh-huh.

179
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,103
Ugh!

180
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:33,839
- Everybody back in the car.
- Where are we going?

181
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,441
- My Uncle Vito's house.
- Where's that?

182
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:37,310
About 15 miles west of here.

183
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:39,711
Do any of youse have a napkin?

184
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,612
Follow us.

185
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:50,856
Whoo!

186
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:53,524
Kiss my ass, chonga!

187
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,574
Gnaw on some meat?

188
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:21,753
Do they even know where we're
going, or are we just lost?

189
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,373
I'll tell you right now, we're
going straight back to Brooklyn

190
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,059
if she thinks we're staying at a
fucking campsite all weekend.

191
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,861
<i>Your news for Ocean County.</i>

192
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:32,564
<i>Human remains were found today in the
Pine Barrens section of New Jersey.</i>

193
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:37,302
<i>According to detectives, the victims were
alleged members of the Rubino crime family.</i>

194
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:42,740
<i>Details of how this will affect the upcoming
trial of Big "V" Rubino, coming up.</i>

195
00:15:46,277 --> 00:15:50,614
- Wow.
- This ain't no campsite.

196
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:59,657
Where the hell are we?

197
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:03,195
We're right at the edge of the
Pine Barrens, that's where we are.

198
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:05,464
So where's this Uncle Vito?

199
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:09,201
He's at his home in Staten Island.
If he tries leaving the house,

200
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:12,604
his ankle bracelet beeps, the cops
come, and he could be put in jail.

201
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:15,908
So he's under house arrest?
I mean, what did he do?

202
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:19,028
You know, he's an entrepreneur.
But because he's Italian,

203
00:16:19,054 --> 00:16:24,783
they keep harassing him for every
single thing he does. It's this way.

204
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:26,684
Oh, wow.

205
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:31,622
Here we are.

206
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,900
You can put your stuff down here.

207
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:45,337
Wow, look at all this stuff.

208
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:49,542
This has all the Belgian whistles.

209
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:51,743
You know, Teresa,
I know your uncle,

210
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,112
and I can't ever see him
buying a house like this.

211
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:57,849
- It was willed to him.
- Willed to him... by who?

212
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,787
Some guy in the entertainment industry
that he used to do business with.

213
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:05,691
- What happened to him?
- Uh, no one really knows.

214
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:08,327
But since my uncle has
business in New York and Philly,

215
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:11,496
he kept this place because it's
located right in the middle.

216
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:13,999
What about the people
that live around here?

217
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,938
My uncle says they're not really friendly,
unless they're trying to sell you things.

218
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:20,706
Well, obviously,
they would be jealous,

219
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:23,309
seeing how they live, and
then seeing all of this.

220
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:27,313
It's pretty awesome... the only thing
we're missing now is a Jacuzzi.

221
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:29,580
Hey, even better.

222
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:31,783
Swimming pool!

223
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,854
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God.

224
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:37,522
Awesome!

225
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:39,324
Perfect.

226
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,928
Oh, my God.

227
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:45,264
Oh, my God.

228
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:46,997
Not too bad, right?

229
00:17:47,023 --> 00:17:49,868
Wow, you guys, we could
totally go swimming later.

230
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:50,969
You guys can go.

231
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,339
It's kind of dirty. Should
we call someone to clean it?

232
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:59,743
Uh, no. I just have to clean the leaves off
with the skimmer and change the filter.

233
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,984
Ew!

234
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:09,588
- Where did that come from?
- He had to come from the lake.

235
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:10,789
Ohh.

236
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,958
Eww!

237
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:14,593
What lake?

238
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:19,463
Um, I think it's... that way.
Come on, I'll show you.

239
00:18:23,768 --> 00:18:25,704
Come on, little guy.

240
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,314
This is not a good idea.

241
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:42,252
Be free, little guy.

242
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:48,727
- Saved your life.
- That's not funny!

243
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:52,564
Teresa can't swim! She has a serious
fear of water, you stupid bitch!

244
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:54,666
Fuck you, Dina. If you didn't
fuck up the beach house,

245
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:57,271
we wouldn't be here right
now. I'm sorry, Teresa.

246
00:18:57,297 --> 00:19:00,539
It's okay. Let's just go back
to the house and unpack.

247
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:05,809
- You okay?
- Yeah... I'm okay.

248
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:16,255
Okay, so there's plenty of
rooms. I'll room with Dina.

249
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:18,957
Gigi with Joanne, and Valerie
and Candi can share a room.

250
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,893
- Uh-uh, I'm not rooming with Candi.
- Why not?

251
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:24,529
- 'Cause she farts in her sleep.
- I do not.

252
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,831
Yeah, you do.

253
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:29,868
Okay, I'll stay with Candi, and
Dina can stay with Valerie.

254
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:32,003
I'll just have to keep
my window open all night.

255
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,705
Knock it off.

256
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:35,140
Where's my cousin gonna sleep?

257
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:37,809
Uh, if she shows up,
she can have the couch.

258
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,845
- Good? Fine.
- All right, let's go.

259
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:40,879
- Whoo!
- Good.

260
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,915
- Come on, my little stinker.
- Oh, stop it.

261
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:47,152
Uhh! This freaking bag is so...

262
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:48,920
heavy!

263
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:52,824
Just be careful. They already
started renovating downstairs.

264
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:59,296
Sorry, Teresa. Was that expensive?

265
00:19:59,931 --> 00:20:02,067
You're not going to unpack?

266
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:05,035
Ugh, I'm so fucking
tired, I'll do it later.

267
00:20:10,308 --> 00:20:12,008
What's that?

268
00:20:13,611 --> 00:20:15,414
What do you think it is?

269
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:17,082
I know what it is, but really?

270
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,063
Did you actually think you would
need that thing down the shore...

271
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:21,553
I mean, you might as well
bring sand to the beach.

272
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:26,658
Well, I don't leave home
without it, and don't touch it.

273
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:30,160
Yeah, 'cause I'm just dying
to touch that skuzzy thing.

274
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:03,126
My name is Edgar.

275
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:08,900
Would you like to try
some of my sausages?

276
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:10,969
No, thank you, Edgar.

277
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:15,640
- Yeah, none of us eat meat.
- Yeah, we're all veterinarians.

278
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:21,513
All you girls look so pretty
and shiny. Are you all sisters?

279
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:27,419
I never had sisters. I have
a brother... he's a asshole.

280
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:32,489
No, we're not sisters, but, um,
it was nice meeting you, Edgar.

281
00:21:55,513 --> 00:21:59,751
So instead of watching hot-looking guys
with washboard stomachs on the beach,

282
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:03,188
we're gonna hang out with Edgar, the
300-pound axe murderer, instead.

283
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:08,460
Just because he's big, sloppy, and weird
doesn't make him an axe murderer.

284
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:11,230
So what are we doing
tonight? I'm getting bored.

285
00:22:11,231 --> 00:22:14,266
I'm not driving all the way back to
the shore in that traffic again.

286
00:22:14,267 --> 00:22:16,601
Fine, Teresa, what do
we do around here?

287
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:21,740
Well, forget about going to a bar or a
club. Those things don't exist around here.

288
00:22:21,741 --> 00:22:25,176
Mm, there was that sign down the
road for that Jersey Devil tour.

289
00:22:25,783 --> 00:22:29,981
Are you kidding me? Walking around in the
woods, listening to stupid ghost stories.

290
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:32,083
Well, we can either do
that or stay here all night

291
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:34,286
while Edgar leers at
us through the windows.

292
00:22:34,287 --> 00:22:37,354
Who knows, maybe
we'll meet some hot guys.

293
00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:48,133
Well... Good evening, ladies.

294
00:22:48,134 --> 00:22:53,038
Would you like to take the,
uh, Jersey Devil tour?

295
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,138
How much for the six of us?

296
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:57,876
Uh... $7.50 apiece.

297
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:03,214
Screw that... we want a discount.
Uh, $50 for the six of us.

298
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:05,248
Fine.

299
00:23:07,251 --> 00:23:10,387
All right, soon as all
your group is here,

300
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:14,533
we'll have Junior take
you on your tour.

301
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,127
Is it scary?

302
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:18,596
Scares the tar outta me.

303
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:21,499
- Great, let's fucking go then.
- Okay, let's go.

304
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:33,245
Okay, I hope we're all keeping our
eyes open for the Jersey Devil.

305
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:39,784
What can you tell us about the... creepy
people living in the Pine Barrens,

306
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:43,188
like cannibals, called Pineys?

307
00:23:43,189 --> 00:23:46,157
Well, there are people
that live around here.

308
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:50,061
Yeah, we heard there are a few dozen Piney
families who are all inbred, illiterate,

309
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:54,666
and very hostile towards outsiders,
living just about a mile down the road.

310
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:56,935
Now that's creepy.

311
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,870
- Hey, Junior?
- Mm-hmm?

312
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:02,339
- Where do<i> you</i> live?
- 'Bout a mile down the road.

313
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:09,664
Now, believe it or not, the
Jersey Devil was the 13th child

314
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:15,920
of a woman named Deborah Leeds who
emigrated from London, England

315
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:20,258
here to the New Jersey
Pine Barrens in the 1700s.

316
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:24,295
Moving here from London and all,
was she able to learn English?

317
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:27,866
That's a pretty good question. I'll
have to get back to you on that.

318
00:24:27,867 --> 00:24:33,451
But anyway, during a very
difficult and painful labor,

319
00:24:33,477 --> 00:24:37,208
Mrs. Leeds invoked the devil.

320
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:42,914
And when the baby was born,

321
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:47,752
it immediately grew into
a full-grown winged devil!

322
00:24:55,794 --> 00:25:00,865
And then escaped from the house
out into these Pine Barrens.

323
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,399
Ohh!

324
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:08,539
- Who keeps hitting my ass?
- No touching.

325
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,942
Ugh... that's disgusting.

326
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:15,280
There are have been hundreds of Devil
sightings throughout the years.

327
00:25:15,281 --> 00:25:17,115
I think these girls like us.

328
00:25:18,818 --> 00:25:22,887
There are six of
them and three of us,

329
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:25,791
so you know what that means?

330
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:29,327
Oh, my God.

331
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:32,197
This could be the greatest
night of our lives!

332
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:34,466
Shh... let's try
to keep them scared,

333
00:25:34,467 --> 00:25:38,870
so that they cling on to
us for safety, and then...

334
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:42,440
- Back to the RV!
- Exactly!

335
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:48,411
This is gonna be so amazing!

336
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:57,521
...one in 1909 by
Councilman Wheaton,

337
00:25:57,522 --> 00:26:02,994
who heard flapping wings outside
his bedroom window one night,

338
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:07,905
and then the next morning,
found large, cloven footprints...

339
00:26:07,931 --> 00:26:09,757
in the snow.

340
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:18,276
Hi. Uh, m-my name is Henry.

341
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:19,978
Uh, what's yours?

342
00:26:19,979 --> 00:26:22,914
- Joanne.
- Oh, nice to meet you.

343
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:27,324
Um, are you girls headed
to the Sci-Fi Expo in DC?

344
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:30,722
Uh, if so, we could
all go together.

345
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:33,525
- Are you serious?
- Sure, uh...

346
00:26:33,526 --> 00:26:38,163
We even have a DVD
player, a microwave,

347
00:26:38,164 --> 00:26:40,330
and a queen-sized bed.

348
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:45,802
Val, wait until you hear this.

349
00:26:47,805 --> 00:26:49,207
Cool!

350
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:52,110
I think she's going to get all
her friends to come along also.

351
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:56,580
- Try to keep them scared.
- Okay, okay.

352
00:26:58,282 --> 00:27:02,186
Hundreds of people have
heard the Jersey Devil

353
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:07,125
rampaging through the
woods while shrieking.

354
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:20,905
Or making blood-curdling cries.

355
00:27:26,712 --> 00:27:30,448
Some call it the Leeds Devil.

356
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:34,552
Some call it the Wozzle Bug.

357
00:27:34,553 --> 00:27:41,092
And others call it the
Hoodle-Doodle Bird.

358
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:45,964
Either way, no one comes
out here alone at night.

359
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:48,366
Oh, God, I'm really feeling scared.
I want to get out of here.

360
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:50,335
What are you worried about?

361
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:53,304
I feel like we're being watched, and
I'm starting to freak out a little.

362
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:55,173
Yeah, you guys, I wanna go back.

363
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:58,142
Why don't you girls give us
your... your email addresses

364
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:00,912
so we can put it on our phones now?

365
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:02,280
Sure...

366
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:04,549
Uh, it's getalife...

367
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,384
- Getalife...
- at...

368
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:10,655
yougottabefuckingkiddingme.com.

369
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:12,857
What's with the mixed messages?

370
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:17,428
I don't know. But it seems like every
girl we meet has the same problem.

371
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:19,664
Help!

372
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,969
Oh, damn!

373
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:28,106
Oh, my God, somebody
give me their belt!

374
00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:31,541
- I gotta make a tourniquet!
- Oh, my God! Oh!

375
00:28:45,024 --> 00:28:46,925
Welcome to the country, girls.

376
00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:51,028
You kidding me? We're getting
the fuck outta here!

377
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:54,098
That was so uncalled
for! Let me go!

378
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:57,035
Come on, don't be
upset. It was all in fun.

379
00:28:57,036 --> 00:28:59,003
F-U-N, fun.

380
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:03,007
No, it's stupidity.
S-T-U... pidity!

381
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:04,175
Are you okay, Val?

382
00:29:04,176 --> 00:29:06,411
I want to get outta here.
I don't like being scared.

383
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:07,412
Let's go.

384
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:10,648
Hey, later, girls.

385
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:14,385
Yeah, that's fucking great, man.

386
00:29:16,322 --> 00:29:18,488
Argh...

387
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,002
Hey, you ready, Gigi?

388
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:34,439
No... you guys go ahead. Mike's
gonna come pick me up later.

389
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,141
I really need to see him
tonight. I'm sorry.

390
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:40,678
- Are you sure about this?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

391
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:45,684
- Okay, I'll see you tonight.
- Bye.

392
00:29:46,085 --> 00:29:49,053
She's ditching us for that
loser again, isn't she?

393
00:29:49,054 --> 00:29:51,723
She seems to love him, so
let her do what she wants.

394
00:29:51,724 --> 00:29:55,259
I don't buy that... I think Michael
just knows how to manipulate Gigi.

395
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,695
He turns her into, like,
his little mental prisoner.

396
00:29:57,696 --> 00:30:00,465
Yeah, kind of like Stockholder
Syndrome or something.

397
00:30:00,491 --> 00:30:01,332
Mm-hmm.

398
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:04,002
Hey, bitches, you
want some pound cake?

399
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:07,739
- Oh, yeah, I'll take some.
- I can't even look at that.

400
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:13,044
- Are you dieting, Val?
- I'm going to.

401
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:17,582
I just took five laxatives last night to
help get my stomach down for the weekend.

402
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:21,786
- Oh, my God.
- That really isn't good for you, you know.

403
00:30:21,787 --> 00:30:25,523
Ugh, well, I don't wanna look like a
stuffed sausage all weekend either.

404
00:30:25,524 --> 00:30:27,291
- Sure you don't want some?
- No.

405
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:30,128
- You're just gonna shit it out anyway.
- No...

406
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:33,664
I wanna have a six
pack for the yum yums.

407
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,200
- Yum yums.
- Yum yum yums!

408
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:38,034
It's hot as fucking here.

409
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,811
Daddy!

410
00:30:46,812 --> 00:30:50,281
Wow, a jellyfish!

411
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:51,682
Don't touch that.

412
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,652
You could get stung
very badly by it.

413
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:57,655
- Ouchie.
- Yeah, ouchie.

414
00:30:57,656 --> 00:30:59,590
Yo, yo, yo, yo!

415
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:00,825
Ohh!

416
00:31:00,826 --> 00:31:05,530
Oh, my God! That took me
all morning to build!

417
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:08,833
Well, build it somewhere else. The
thing just made me drop the ball.

418
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:12,303
Are you kidding me? You have
the entire beach to play on!

419
00:31:12,304 --> 00:31:16,140
Because the people is over there,
and if we play over there,

420
00:31:16,141 --> 00:31:18,676
no one's gonna be able
to see us right there.

421
00:31:18,677 --> 00:31:21,666
So why don't you pick up
all your sand and move it?

422
00:31:21,692 --> 00:31:23,615
Over there! You feeling me?

423
00:31:23,616 --> 00:31:26,983
And take your faggot-ass
pail and shovel with you.

424
00:31:35,694 --> 00:31:38,027
Oww...

425
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,433
Ouchie.

426
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:46,669
What you looking at?

427
00:31:50,741 --> 00:31:52,443
There's no fucking parking.

428
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:56,314
Well, if you didn't make us late, we
would have been here two hours ago.

429
00:31:56,315 --> 00:31:57,815
Fuck you, Joanne.

430
00:31:57,816 --> 00:32:01,752
- Can you both please stop it now?
- Stay the fuck outta this, Valerie.

431
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:05,223
- Yeah, shut the fuck up, Valerie.
- Don't tell her to shut the fuck up.

432
00:32:05,224 --> 00:32:07,725
- Who the fuck are you?
- Bunch of pains in the asses.

433
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:10,361
All right, guys, calm down.
We're already here.

434
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:12,595
Ah, there's a space.

435
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:16,834
Give me the handicapped pass in the
glove compartment, just in case.

436
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:20,737
- We're not disabled.
- Just limp a little when you walk out.

437
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:24,876
- Ready?
- Whoo!

438
00:32:24,877 --> 00:32:27,544
Here we are.

439
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:29,747
Whoo!

440
00:32:32,017 --> 00:32:34,492
I was dying for one
of these corndogs.

441
00:32:34,518 --> 00:32:36,587
- Me too.
- Me three.

442
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:40,358
- Hey, what about your diet?
- I don't wanna starve to death.

443
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:43,261
Why don't we set up over here?

444
00:32:43,262 --> 00:32:47,165
No... I see where we should go.

445
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:49,333
Yo, throw the ball!

446
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:51,568
Hyuh! Freddy, you asshole!

447
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,895
- Ooh la la!
- Let's go, girls! Come on!

448
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:58,742
Let me out!

449
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:01,745
Uhh!

450
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:04,248
Gigi, get over here! I'm
not done with you yet!

451
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:06,384
Well, I'm done with you, Michael, and
if you know what's good for you,

452
00:33:06,385 --> 00:33:08,686
get your ass off
Teresa's uncle's property.

453
00:33:08,687 --> 00:33:13,324
Gigi... you little bitch, get over here!
You know what, I'm done with you!

454
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:16,092
Stop following me, Michael!

455
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,734
I have to tell you, Tre...

456
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:28,205
Despite the mix-up with the house, I think
this is gonna be a really good weekend.

457
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:37,715
No, please, please! Help me!

458
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:41,786
No, stop, please!
Stop, let me go! Please!

459
00:33:41,787 --> 00:33:46,591
And if not for you, we would've had to have
turned back yesterday and miss all of this.

460
00:33:46,592 --> 00:33:48,625
No, no, no!

461
00:33:56,133 --> 00:33:57,435
Thank you.

462
00:33:57,436 --> 00:34:01,272
You don't have to thank me.
We're all in the same boat.

463
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:18,522
- That didn't take long.
- No, it didn't.

464
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:21,359
Impressive, I have to say.
We gotta step up our game.

465
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:23,761
Ah, ow!

466
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:25,162
God.

467
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:29,076
Teresa and Dina... This is...

468
00:34:29,102 --> 00:34:33,371
Tony, Joey, Gino,
Vinnie, and Freddy.

469
00:34:33,372 --> 00:34:35,973
- Hi.
- Hi...

470
00:34:36,746 --> 00:34:38,948
Oh, wow.

471
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:41,279
- What is that?
- It's a mime.

472
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,647
A what?

473
00:34:42,648 --> 00:34:45,316
What is he doing? Why
is he wearing that?

474
00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:48,586
- Dude, there's no window there.
- He's just pretendin', Tony!

475
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,655
- Ohh...
- He is cute.

476
00:34:50,656 --> 00:34:52,423
I don't get it, either.

477
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:53,958
Oh! Aww...

478
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:56,427
Now he's hitting on her.

479
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:59,497
Now get the fuck outta here, Bozo.

480
00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:05,736
- He's doing you, Gino!
- Gino, that's you.

481
00:35:05,737 --> 00:35:07,471
You gonna take that, Gino?

482
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:09,006
Yo...

483
00:35:09,007 --> 00:35:12,777
Yeah, keep going. Really?

484
00:35:13,178 --> 00:35:13,878
Yeah.

485
00:35:16,715 --> 00:35:18,616
- One punch!
- Good night, motherfucker!

486
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:20,084
- Now get the fuck outta here...
- Asshole!

487
00:35:20,085 --> 00:35:21,919
Before I throws you a real beatin'!

488
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,321
Whoo!

489
00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:26,324
- Who's going in the water with me?
- I am, let's go!

490
00:35:26,325 --> 00:35:29,060
- Yo, Gino, go out for a pass.
- Hey, wanna catch some crabs?

491
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:35,433
Hey, we're going to the Barnacle
Club later if you guys wanna come.

492
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:49,385
There's something so relaxing,
you know, and elegant

493
00:35:49,411 --> 00:35:51,849
about the beach. You
know what I mean?

494
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:55,019
- I just love the fresh air.
- Mmm.

495
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,421
Those guys were kinda
hot, don't you think?

496
00:35:57,422 --> 00:36:00,925
- They were definitely hot for you.
- Ooh, yum, yum, yum.

497
00:36:00,926 --> 00:36:03,627
- Oh, my God!
- What?

498
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:04,995
- Oh, I have to go!
- Go where?

499
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,798
Uh, the laxatives are kicking in.
I have to go to the bathroom right now!

500
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:10,634
Oh, my God, oh, quick, run up to
the boardwalk and find a restroom!

501
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:13,771
Aah! Aah! Get out of the way!

502
00:36:13,772 --> 00:36:16,073
- What?
- I gotta go!

503
00:36:16,074 --> 00:36:19,744
- Oh, my God!
- Oh... my... God.

504
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,148
Ohh.

505
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:26,083
- Eww...
- Ohh.

506
00:36:26,084 --> 00:36:28,819
Look, Daddy, sea shells.

507
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:32,789
Come on, Valerie. We've
gotta get ready for tonight!

508
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:36,826
Hey, you got any more corndogs?

509
00:36:39,029 --> 00:36:40,563
Poopy.

510
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:50,108
All right, we got dollar Jersey Devil
shots for the next two minutes,

511
00:36:50,134 --> 00:36:52,675
so go to the bar and get you some!

512
00:36:54,446 --> 00:36:56,647
- Here's to the king.
- What king?

513
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:58,649
- Fuc-king!
- Fuc-king!

514
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:01,485
Oh.

515
00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:04,755
So, fellas, who's gonna
pay for all these drinks?

516
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:06,190
- He is.
- He is.

517
00:37:06,191 --> 00:37:07,491
- You are.
- You are.

518
00:37:07,492 --> 00:37:09,660
- I'm paying for the cab.
- I always pay for the cab!

519
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:11,763
- No, you pay for the drinks.
- Hey, you watch yourself there.

520
00:37:11,764 --> 00:37:15,599
You gotta be faster than that to stay in
the ring with the Staten Island Stallion.

521
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,869
Man, you got it all wrong.
If you weren't my boy,

522
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:22,137
you wouldn't even make it to the ring.
Pa-pow! End of story, motherfucker.

523
00:37:22,163 --> 00:37:24,635
- Who's next?
- Bullshit!

524
00:37:24,661 --> 00:37:27,912
- You never popped nothing.
- How the fuck do you know?

525
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:31,175
'Cause I've known you since we were 12,
and you have such a big fucking mouth

526
00:37:31,201 --> 00:37:33,317
that half of Staten Island
would have known about it.

527
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:35,180
There would have been billboards
along the highway saying,

528
00:37:35,206 --> 00:37:38,556
"Gino Digideo whacked some
dude. Paid for by Gino Digideo."

529
00:37:38,557 --> 00:37:41,557
I like it. I like it.

530
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:57,074
Yeah, let's do some more shots, buddy.
Let's get some more... which ones?

531
00:37:57,075 --> 00:37:58,108
Ohh!

532
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,712
- What the fuck?
- I'll tell you what the fuck.

533
00:38:00,713 --> 00:38:04,515
That's for drugging and raping my friend
Tammy last week, you fucking dirty scumbag.

534
00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:06,617
Yo, I don't even know
what you're talking about.

535
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:10,054
Yes, you do, and two other people saw
you drop a fucking pill in her drink.

536
00:38:10,055 --> 00:38:14,592
Yo, that bitch was DTF, so get the fuck
outta my face before I smack your mouth.

537
00:38:14,593 --> 00:38:17,161
I bet you would, you
fucking dirty scumbag.

538
00:38:17,162 --> 00:38:19,830
- Get the fuck out of here, you slut.
- You can't do that in here, come on.

539
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:21,031
- You're out.
- Get off of me!

540
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:24,533
- Bye-bye, you little twat.
- Peace!

541
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:27,037
Works every time.

542
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:29,740
Yo, bro, we gotta get another
bottle of that shit.

543
00:38:29,741 --> 00:38:33,142
All right, my guy's coming in
next week. I'll get a shitload.

544
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:53,531
- Hello.
- How you doing?

545
00:38:53,532 --> 00:38:55,766
If I was you, I'd
be stalking me too.

546
00:38:55,767 --> 00:39:01,270
Oh... well, let's have a couple more
drinks and see who's stalking who.

547
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:08,110
- After you.
- Thank you.

548
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:20,755
Right now, I'm just working on my
demo, trying to get signed to a label,

549
00:39:20,781 --> 00:39:23,327
- you know what I'm saying?
- Get a label.

550
00:39:23,328 --> 00:39:26,730
What the fuck are you
laughing at, Dominic?

551
00:39:28,155 --> 00:39:33,203
Look at you, kid. Who we kidding?
You can't sing, you can't rap.

552
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,172
You can't even play a
goddamn instrument.

553
00:39:35,173 --> 00:39:37,808
How the hell is a record
company gonna sign you?

554
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:42,913
'Cause I'm that fucking down! Besides,
what the fuck do you know about records?

555
00:39:42,914 --> 00:39:45,049
You're just a part-time
manager at a nightclub.

556
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:48,227
If I need the urinals or some
shit cleaned, I'll give you a call.

557
00:39:51,189 --> 00:39:54,224
- You don't know who the hell I am.
- That's the point.

558
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:58,329
We don't know who the fuck you
are, and nobody else does either.

559
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:03,966
I'll be back.

560
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:11,208
So, I was just down in the ladies' room,
and it's, like, totally empty down there.

561
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:17,081
Like, two people could totally have
sex and no one would know, but...

562
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:20,985
that... that would be wrong, right?

563
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:23,754
Oh, no.

564
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:27,024
Yo, yo, yo, for the first
time in over two decades,

565
00:40:27,025 --> 00:40:32,830
give it up for the one, the
only, Jersey's own Italian Ice!

566

00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:47,791
Hey, come on, come on.

602
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:51,128
Hey, youse is all suspended from the
club for the rest of the summer.

603
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:52,563
But they started it!

604
00:43:52,564 --> 00:43:54,765
- Yeah, but you threw your drink at her.
- It spilled!

605
00:43:54,766 --> 00:43:57,534
- Ah, get the fuck outta here.
- Motherfucker!

606
00:43:57,535 --> 00:44:01,071
We can't go out like this, so
let's just go back to the house.

607
00:44:01,072 --> 00:44:02,506
- Hey.
- Fuck it.

608
00:44:02,507 --> 00:44:05,842
- Hey, where youse goin'?
- Back to our house... you coming?

609
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:08,011
- Yeah, we're going. Yeah, we're going.
- Just follow us.

610
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:09,046
Come on.

611
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:13,249
Let's have some fun now!

612
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:18,889
How many times have you been
banned from this club before?

613
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:22,492
- Ah, I've been banned, like, three times.
- Three times... no way!

614
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:24,561
Shh! Shh...

615
00:44:24,562 --> 00:44:27,029
Shh.

616
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:30,899
What the hell was that?

617
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:37,407
- Someone's in the house.
- What?

618
00:44:40,245 --> 00:44:42,079
Who the hell are you?

619
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,882
I'm Rosemarie! Val's cousin.

620
00:44:44,883 --> 00:44:48,352
- Rosemarie!
- Valerie, there you are!

621
00:44:48,353 --> 00:44:50,995
Everyone, this is
Rosemarie, my cousin.

622
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:53,461
I texted her the address this
morning. I forgot to tell you.

623
00:44:53,462 --> 00:44:56,260
Thanks. Uh, how did
you get in here?

624
00:44:56,261 --> 00:45:00,397
The sliding glass door was unlocked, so
I just came in and made me some dinner.

625
00:45:00,398 --> 00:45:02,876
Oh, God, was I starving.
By the way...

626
00:45:02,902 --> 00:45:05,569
you're gonna need some more Super
Fudge ice cream and beef jerky.

627
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:09,907
Yo, this place is fuckin' hooked!

628
00:45:09,908 --> 00:45:12,309
A little out of the
way, but hooked.

629
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:15,479
What happened to Gigi? She should
have been back here by now.

630
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,414
Maybe Rosemarie ate her.

631
00:45:18,616 --> 00:45:20,617
Watch it, that's my cousin.

632
00:45:20,618 --> 00:45:23,687
- Where do you keep the liquor?
- Screw that, where's the food?

633
00:45:23,688 --> 00:45:25,522
I'll nuke some fried chicken.

634
00:45:25,523 --> 00:45:27,556
- He's hungry.
- Yes!

635
00:45:28,958 --> 00:45:33,263
"Fat Camp Massacre!" This is
supposed to be the best movie ever!

636
00:45:33,264 --> 00:45:35,332
Oh, yeah, yeah, put it on.

637
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:38,235
- Hey, I want a leg!
- I want breast!

638
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:41,138
- I just want a piece of ass!
- Aah!

639
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:45,208
Ooh... Oh, yeah...

640
00:46:00,525 --> 00:46:01,692
Roger.

641
00:46:02,694 --> 00:46:06,562
Roger. Roger!

642
00:46:08,698 --> 00:46:11,635
Roger! I smell pizza.

643
00:46:11,636 --> 00:46:16,506
I told you already. Stop thinking about
food, and go back to sleep, Keith.

644
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:20,177
If they catch you eating at night one
more time, they're gonna kick you out.

645
00:46:20,178 --> 00:46:25,247
I don't care about that. I smell pizza,
I'm starving... I'm gonna find it.

646
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:44,201
Cupcake!

647
00:46:48,405 --> 00:46:51,308
Ohh, I finally found you, cupcake.

648
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:53,776
Mmm...

649
00:46:55,479 --> 00:47:00,016
Now where's that fucking
pizza? I'm starving!

650
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,453
Pizza!

651
00:47:08,359 --> 00:47:09,760
Oh, my leg!

652
00:47:09,761 --> 00:47:13,497
I wouldn't mind being stuck in a bear trap
alone in the woods if it was with you.

653
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:17,167
Ooh, who needs a bear trap when
I have handcuffs in my bedroom,

654
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:20,103
- you sexy little ape, you?
- You little freak!

655
00:47:20,104 --> 00:47:21,371
- Uh-huh.
- Uhh!

656
00:47:24,742 --> 00:47:26,043
Oh, my God!

657
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:31,782
- Bye! Whoo!
- Later, boys.

658
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:35,862
Who are you?

659
00:47:35,888 --> 00:47:41,058
I'm Cupcake the Clown. And
you just ate my cupcake.

660
00:47:41,059 --> 00:47:44,161
So now it's time to cut a few
calories the old-fashioned way!

661
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:47,497
Get me outta here, Mister.
Come on, get me outta here!

662
00:47:48,733 --> 00:47:50,200
Certainly.

663
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:57,341
I'd smack that clown so fucking
hard, he'd be begging me to stop.

664
00:47:57,542 --> 00:48:00,210
Where are you taking
me, you big ape?

665
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:04,214
- To the bedroom.
- We just passed it. Put me down!

666
00:48:08,451 --> 00:48:10,821
So... do you have a girlfriend?

667
00:48:10,822 --> 00:48:14,524
No, sweet tits. I don't
get burned like that.

668
00:48:14,525 --> 00:48:18,795
So why don't you do me a favor...
go into that bedroom.

669
00:48:18,796 --> 00:48:22,766
I'm going to the shower
and rinse off, okay?

670
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:49,693
The Electro Beam 300? Classic!

671
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:14,249
Ba ba!

672
00:49:32,169 --> 00:49:33,570
Yeah.

673
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:45,448
You little freak.

674
00:49:46,851 --> 00:49:49,953
Oh, no. I'm a prisoner.

675
00:49:49,954 --> 00:49:52,587
Please, don't hurt me.

676
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:02,898
What?

677
00:50:43,941 --> 00:50:46,676
I just wanted a slice!

678
00:50:46,677 --> 00:50:50,714
- Yo, get that fat piece of shit!
- Yeah, cry like a little bitch, fat boy.

679
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:17,841
I can't take this shit.
Who wants to take a swim?

680
00:51:18,142 --> 00:51:19,509
Me.

681
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:20,909
Let's go.

682
00:51:29,887 --> 00:51:33,056
Ha ha ha! Prepare to die!

683
00:51:37,828 --> 00:51:40,430
Ohh!

684
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:42,032
Damn...

685
00:52:01,851 --> 00:52:04,453
Wait for me!

686
00:52:07,924 --> 00:52:11,661
I could totally see you as
becoming a lawyer. You know why?

687
00:52:11,662 --> 00:52:15,365
You got eyes just like the
guy from "Law and Order."

688
00:52:15,766 --> 00:52:18,935
Yeah, so maybe that's
what I should do...

689
00:52:18,936 --> 00:52:21,371
becoming a backstabbing lawyer
and make a lot of money.

690
00:52:21,372 --> 00:52:23,440
What about you?

691
00:52:23,441 --> 00:52:27,944
I could be your secretary. I got lots
of really sexy dresses and nice boobs,

692
00:52:27,945 --> 00:52:30,580
and I'm really good
at answering the phone.

693
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:37,554
Val, Dina. Come over here so I can show
you the new pictures of Mr. Wiggles.

694
00:52:37,555 --> 00:52:38,888
- Mr. Wiggles!
- Ohh...

695
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:40,422
You sit tight there.

696
00:52:43,459 --> 00:52:47,564
- Who the fuck is Mr. Wiggles?
- Rosemarie's pet ferret! Wanna see it?

697
00:52:47,565 --> 00:52:49,699
- Aww!
- Isn't he sweet?

698
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:53,269
This is me and Mr.
Wiggles in the shower.

699
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:54,504
Aww!

700
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:57,140
Dude, what the fuck is wrong
with these fucking girls?

701
00:52:57,141 --> 00:52:59,509
I love that one!

702
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:01,945
I'm not fucking putting
up with this shit no more.

703
00:53:01,946 --> 00:53:05,781
See, he's got a
personality like a person.

704
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:12,187
Where do you two
think you're going?

705
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:16,459
I'm taking my secretary...
to the boardroom.

706
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,962
He wants me to take dick-tation.

707
00:53:20,598 --> 00:53:22,164
Oh, shut up.

708
00:53:44,754 --> 00:53:48,057
Get lost. We're trying
to have a conversation.

709
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,427
- Freddy, come here.
- What?

710
00:53:50,428 --> 00:53:55,063
I don't know, I got a math question I'm
trying to figure out. Just get over here.

711
00:54:02,106 --> 00:54:03,473
What do you want?

712
00:54:03,474 --> 00:54:06,009
Look, Tony wants to get with Dina.

713
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:08,845
I wanna get with Teresa, and you
wanna get with Valerie, right?

714
00:54:08,846 --> 00:54:09,846
Yeah.

715
00:54:09,847 --> 00:54:13,483
Well, there's four of them,
and there's three of us.

716
00:54:13,484 --> 00:54:14,851
So you know what that means?

717
00:54:14,852 --> 00:54:18,455
No one is gonna get with anyone until we
figure out a way to extract the grenade.

718
00:54:18,456 --> 00:54:19,656
Make it three on three.

719
00:54:19,657 --> 00:54:22,025
Hey, girls, girls, you guys...
you guys want a doughnut?

720
00:54:22,026 --> 00:54:24,088
No, the doughnuts are for
you, honey. We get it...

721
00:54:24,114 --> 00:54:26,451
you like to eat fuckin'
doughnuts all the time.

722
00:54:26,477 --> 00:54:29,766
No fucking way. I'm not taking one for the
team for the fifth fucking time in a row.

723
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:32,502
- Oh, come on, Freddy.
- We got a better idea.

724
00:54:32,503 --> 00:54:34,504
Just start talking to
her as if you like her,

725
00:54:34,505 --> 00:54:36,840
and pretend you're interested
in what she says, right?

726
00:54:36,841 --> 00:54:39,642
Ask her to take you to the store,
like you gotta go get something.

727
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:42,879
Yeah, use my car. Now, when you
get a few miles down the road,

728
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,282
just open the door, let
her out, and drive away.

729
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:49,986
Yeah, but then when she finds her way
back, they're all gonna hate us.

730
00:54:49,987 --> 00:54:52,255
So? We'll be done.

731
00:54:52,256 --> 00:54:56,259
Yeah... Tony will be smashing Dina,
I'll be hooking up with Teresa,

732
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:57,994
and Valerie, she'll be all yours.

733
00:55:00,898 --> 00:55:01,898
Youse are good.

734
00:55:01,899 --> 00:55:04,666
- Go get 'em.
- Watch this.

735
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:09,172
What are you guys talking
about over there?

736
00:55:09,173 --> 00:55:12,141
Tony just wanted to find
out the square route of 37,

737
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,744
so I figured I'd help
him out, you know?

738
00:55:14,745 --> 00:55:18,281
Oh, okay.

739
00:55:18,282 --> 00:55:22,318
- You must be good with numbers.
- Well...

740
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,787
I know a perfect 10 when I see one.

741
00:55:24,788 --> 00:55:28,858
Ohh.... You're so sweet.

742
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:32,529
I never got to tell you about
my ferret, Mr. Wiggles.

743
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:35,198
Oh, yeah, I'm so interested.
Please, tell me.

744
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:39,168
Well, every Christmas, I dress
him up in a ballerina costume.

745
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:42,205
Wow. Jeez.

746
00:55:42,206 --> 00:55:43,706
What?

747
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:49,012
Oh, nothing, I just wish I had a cigarette
when we talked about Mr. Wiggles.

748
00:55:49,013 --> 00:55:51,814
We could drive into town
to get a pack, if you want.

749
00:55:51,815 --> 00:55:54,083
Yeah, that's a great idea!

750
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:57,620
Then we could smoke cigarettes and
talk about Mr. Wiggles all night!

751
00:55:57,621 --> 00:55:59,321
Let's go!

752
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:16,773
Oh, you nasty little bitch.

753
00:56:16,774 --> 00:56:19,976
Oh... oh.

754
00:56:19,977 --> 00:56:22,645
Oh, fuck yeah.

755
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,620
Aah!

756
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:45,201
- I have a hamster named Buzzy that...
- Oh, wow, that's fucking amazing.

757
00:56:45,202 --> 00:56:47,736
He knows how to swim.

758
00:56:57,079 --> 00:56:59,348
Hey, what's up?

759
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:02,885
Nothing, just, uh,
catching up on some emails.

760
00:57:02,886 --> 00:57:06,388
That's cool. So, uh...

761
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:10,702
- you get good reception out here?
- Yeah, it's not too bad.

762
00:57:10,728 --> 00:57:13,329
- Oh, really?
- Yeah...

763
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:15,832
So, um...

764
00:57:15,833 --> 00:57:18,301
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

765
00:57:18,302 --> 00:57:19,969
Nothing, I'm just
hanging out, you know?

766
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:21,971
- It's all good, sweetheart.
- It's, uh...

767
00:57:21,972 --> 00:57:26,977
- You're gonna have fun, come on.
- Yeah, I'm having a good time.

768
00:57:27,678 --> 00:57:29,212
Just relax.

769
00:57:29,213 --> 00:57:31,247
- I'm pretty relaxed.
- Just relax.

770
00:57:31,248 --> 00:57:33,616
- What the fuck?!
- What the hell was that?

771
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:36,819
What the fuck?! What, you
don't wanna be with<i> me?</i>

772
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:39,088
No, why would you think
I'd wanna be with you?

773
00:57:39,089 --> 00:57:42,392
'Cause every other bitch in New
Jersey would kill to wife me up!

774
00:57:42,393 --> 00:57:43,860
Wife... really?

775
00:57:43,861 --> 00:57:47,664
'Cause if I was married to you, I'd put
poison in your orange juice every morning!

776
00:57:47,665 --> 00:57:52,169
Yeah, well, if I was married to
you, I'd drink it, you fuckin' bitch!

777
00:57:54,538 --> 00:57:56,204
Dick.

778
00:58:01,744 --> 00:58:06,249
So, uh, is Buzzy a boy
or a girl hamster?

779
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:11,387
So how much longer to the store?

780
00:58:11,388 --> 00:58:15,224
Couldn't be much further.
Oh, my God, you see that?

781
00:58:15,425 --> 00:58:16,259
See what?

782
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:18,795
Looked like a little puppy
dog... it crossed the road.

783
00:58:18,796 --> 00:58:22,165
- A puppy dog?
- Yeah, it looked like it was lost!

784
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:24,467
Stop the car!

785
00:58:24,468 --> 00:58:28,471
I think it ran into the cow pasture! Oh,
God, I hope the cows don't eat him!

786
00:58:28,472 --> 00:58:30,440
Oh, my God!

787
00:58:34,812 --> 00:58:38,214
Freddy! Freddy, you asshole!

788
00:58:46,223 --> 00:58:49,358
<i>There's so many hot
gorilla juiceheads in here...</i>

789
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,094
Hey, where's Rosemarie?

790
00:58:51,095 --> 00:58:55,264
Uh, she saw an all-night buffet and
decided to go back for a midnight snack.

791
00:58:57,867 --> 00:58:59,202
What?

792
00:58:59,203 --> 00:59:02,038
<i>Mmm. Where's my shot?</i>

793
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:04,107
<i>- Hey, wingman!</i>
<i>- Oh, yeah!</i>

794
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:09,912
Huh?

795
00:59:09,913 --> 00:59:11,247
Ah!

796
00:59:18,956 --> 00:59:22,925
- Vinnie, you fucking asshole!
- What?

797
00:59:22,926 --> 00:59:26,396
Fuck all of youse. I need a smoke.

798
00:59:28,832 --> 00:59:30,500
Yo, hey, come back here, you pussy!

799
00:59:30,501 --> 00:59:33,635
What'd you have, two bowls
of stupid this morning?

800
00:59:37,508 --> 00:59:39,041
Oh, that was a good one.

801
00:59:40,043 --> 00:59:42,779
- Yo, that was dope.
- Eww.

802
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:43,885
Why do they keep flying into it

803
00:59:43,911 --> 00:59:46,549
when they see their friends
exploding all over the place?

804
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:52,221
Just mindless life forms following the
light aimlessly into the darkness.

805
00:59:58,395 --> 00:59:59,927
Mm?

806
01:00:28,425 --> 01:00:30,026
Hey, anybody home in here?

807
01:00:42,004 --> 01:00:45,441
- Hey, where'd Freddy go?
- He had a hissy fit and took off.

808
01:00:45,442 --> 01:00:48,110
Oh, he's got my fucking keys!

809
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:51,280
You just gonna leave
me here? Screw him.

810
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:54,917
- Ah, quiet, bitch.
- Screw you.

811
01:00:54,918 --> 01:00:57,186
Hey, Freddy!

812
01:00:57,587 --> 01:01:01,224
- What's he doing?
- Dropping dead, I hope.

813
01:01:01,425 --> 01:01:04,560
Hey, I'm starving.
What do we got to eat?

814
01:01:04,561 --> 01:01:07,029
I got some hot dogs in the fridge.

815
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:10,732
Hot dogs? I'm all over that shit.

816
01:01:15,639 --> 01:01:21,309
Hey, Freddy, you fucking
dickhead! Where are you?

817
01:01:31,687 --> 01:01:33,757
Freddy?

818
01:01:34,458 --> 01:01:36,259
Where the fuck are you?

819
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:38,393
Vinnie!

820
01:01:40,162 --> 01:01:43,430
If he's fucking with me, I'm
gonna throw him a beatin'.

821
01:01:47,536 --> 01:01:49,404
Freddy?

822
01:01:55,578 --> 01:01:59,215
So, yeah, I do, like, about
1,000 push-ups every day.

823
01:01:59,216 --> 01:02:01,250
Really?

824
01:02:01,251 --> 01:02:03,419
I need to eat<i> now.</i>

825
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:07,990
Good... get the barbecue going
while I get the other stuff ready.

826
01:02:07,991 --> 01:02:10,393
All right.

827
01:02:29,712 --> 01:02:31,647
Mm!

828
01:03:24,633 --> 01:03:27,737
No...

829
01:04:58,061 --> 01:04:59,961
Kill me.

830
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:05,868
Please kill me.

831
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:16,812
Did you hear that?

832
01:05:17,113 --> 01:05:18,180
Hear what?

833
01:05:18,181 --> 01:05:19,882
I thought I heard
something outside.

834
01:05:19,883 --> 01:05:22,552
It's probably just the
guys horsing around.

835
01:05:25,855 --> 01:05:28,357
There it is again.

836
01:05:28,358 --> 01:05:30,559
Why don't you see if they
want anything to eat?

837
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:33,395
Yeah, Val, I'm starving.

838
01:05:33,396 --> 01:05:37,666
All right. I'll be right back.

839
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:41,337
Mmm.

840
01:05:41,338 --> 01:05:43,372
Told you I was hungry.

841
01:05:57,419 --> 01:05:59,455
Freddy?

842
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:02,123
Vinnie.

843
01:06:03,726 --> 01:06:05,993
Freddy?

844
01:06:06,729 --> 01:06:09,330
Stop horsing around.

845
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:12,801
Vinnie?

846
01:06:17,439 --> 01:06:19,473
Freddy?

847
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:27,315
Vinnie?

848
01:06:29,718 --> 01:06:31,552
Freddy!

849
01:06:33,689 --> 01:06:36,659
Hey, how many dogs am I
supposed to be making out there?

850
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:40,930
- We don't know yet.
- Where the hell is Valerie?

851
01:06:41,431 --> 01:06:44,366
So, Dina, whose house
is this anyway?

852
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:47,503
- It's Teresa's Uncle Vito's house.
- And who's Uncle Vito?

853
01:06:47,504 --> 01:06:50,472
Vito Rubino.

854
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:54,777
Teresa's uncle is Big "V" Rubino?

855
01:06:54,778 --> 01:06:57,214
- Isn't he in jail?
- He's under house arrest...

856
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:01,316
but I wouldn't bet on too many
witnesses testifying against him.

857
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:05,688
That's it. I gotta go find where these
meatballs are. I'll be right back.

858
01:07:05,689 --> 01:07:07,590
Hurry up.

859
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:18,934
Yo, Freddy, Vinnie! Teresa's
uncle is Big "V" Rubino.

860
01:07:18,935 --> 01:07:21,969
We gotta get the fuck outta here!

861
01:07:26,508 --> 01:07:29,377
Hey, you dickheads in there?

862
01:07:32,881 --> 01:07:34,949
What the fuck?

863
01:07:53,001 --> 01:07:55,638
I'm gonna go and straighten
things up around the pool.

864
01:07:55,639 --> 01:07:58,340
- You want a hand?
- No, I got it, um...

865
01:07:58,341 --> 01:08:02,409
could you clean things up around here and
see when everyone would like to eat?

866
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:08,849
I bet they'll be
dying to eat by now.

867
01:08:36,312 --> 01:08:38,012
Shit!

868
01:09:22,692 --> 01:09:24,992
Bunch of pigs.

869
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:28,496
Ugh.

870
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:42,476
You guys want something to eat?

871
01:09:52,655 --> 01:09:54,890
Dina! Dina!

872
01:09:56,926 --> 01:09:58,394
Dina!

873
01:09:58,395 --> 01:10:01,511
Joey and Joanne! They're dead.

874
01:10:01,537 --> 01:10:04,761
- So is Gigi!
- What about Candi and Gino?

875
01:10:04,762 --> 01:10:07,770
I don't know... I don't know. They
have to still be in their room.

876
01:10:07,771 --> 01:10:10,439
Oh, my God.

877
01:10:23,952 --> 01:10:27,588
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

878
01:10:34,496 --> 01:10:35,931
Wait...

879
01:10:40,368 --> 01:10:41,770
Gino!

880
01:10:48,344 --> 01:10:50,012
Dina!

881
01:10:50,013 --> 01:10:54,183
Dina, open the door! Dina, help me!

882
01:10:54,184 --> 01:10:56,183
Tony!

883
01:11:09,865 --> 01:11:12,034
Help me.

884
01:11:13,069 --> 01:11:16,939
- Oh, my God, what's going on?
- I don't know... call 9-1-1.

885
01:11:20,176 --> 01:11:22,511
Uncle Vito? Uncle Vito, pick up!

886
01:11:22,512 --> 01:11:25,113
Yeah, somebody's trying to kill us!

887
01:11:30,886 --> 01:11:33,354
Quick, open the door!

888
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:39,094
Ohh!

889
01:11:39,095 --> 01:11:43,130
Dina, it's stuck! Oh, my God.

890
01:11:46,001 --> 01:11:48,103
- Run!
- Oh, my God.

891
01:11:50,273 --> 01:11:54,142
Come on... come on,
get up! Get up... run!

892
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:56,310
Let's get out of here!

893
01:12:01,484 --> 01:12:03,552
Oh, my God!

894
01:12:07,757 --> 01:12:09,925
- Oh, God.
- Oh, holy shit.

895
01:12:09,926 --> 01:12:11,860
Oh, God.

896
01:12:11,861 --> 01:12:14,763
- Where are the fucking keys?
- Come on!

897
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:26,275
Come on!

898
01:12:26,276 --> 01:12:28,877
Let us in!

899
01:12:28,878 --> 01:12:32,479
It's locked! Come on!

900
01:12:33,081 --> 01:12:35,049
Come on.

901
01:12:35,918 --> 01:12:37,551
Ohh!

902
01:12:56,272 --> 01:12:58,173
Shit!

903
01:12:58,174 --> 01:13:01,977
- Where's the fucking light switch?
- I don't know. I got it!

904
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:15,057
Go, go, go! Go!

905
01:13:16,326 --> 01:13:18,927
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!

906
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,567
Come on, come on!

907
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:31,773
- Valerie!
- Valerie!

908
01:13:31,774 --> 01:13:33,707
My God!

909
01:13:47,724 --> 01:13:49,922
- Where the fuck can we go?
- We can't use the cars...

910
01:13:49,948 --> 01:13:52,383
- and he'll catch us in the woods.
- If we can get to the rowboat...

911
01:13:52,409 --> 01:13:54,233
we can take it to the middle of the
lake, where he can't reach us.

912
01:13:54,234 --> 01:13:57,816
You know I can't swim!
If I fall in, I'll drown!

913
01:13:57,867 --> 01:14:01,036
Jesus Christ, Teresa,
he's gonna kill us!

914
01:14:02,038 --> 01:14:05,205
Who are you?

915
01:14:07,309 --> 01:14:09,211
Edgar?

916
01:14:09,212 --> 01:14:11,780
Troy, my name is.

917
01:14:11,781 --> 01:14:15,250
- Why?!
- It's a Jersey thing.

918
01:14:16,653 --> 01:14:18,053
Dina, look out!

919
01:14:19,155 --> 01:14:21,289
Dina!

920
01:14:46,981 --> 01:14:49,084
Police!

921
01:14:51,921 --> 01:14:54,189
What's wrong? Tell me what's wrong!

922
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:56,058
Everybody's dead!

923
01:14:56,059 --> 01:14:58,960
Everybody? Is there anybody else?

924
01:14:58,961 --> 01:15:01,396
- In the house.
- All right, stay here.

925
01:15:01,397 --> 01:15:03,098
Backup and the ambulance
are on the way.

926
01:15:03,099 --> 01:15:06,134
Stay right here. Dennis, come on.

927
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:23,385
I'm Officer Davis. Do you need
any kind of medical assistance?

928
01:15:23,386 --> 01:15:26,254
Okay. Go check inside!

929
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:28,724
Okay, I need you to tell
me everything that happened.

930
01:15:28,725 --> 01:15:31,760
- I need to see Dina!
- No, no, no.

931
01:15:31,761 --> 01:15:34,595
You can't go in there. You
need to stay out here with me.

932
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:42,704
I'll take care of this one. Check
the rest of the barn for me.

933
01:15:42,705 --> 01:15:44,039
Okay.

934
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:50,346
He's got a pulse! Help
me get the gurney.

935
01:16:07,829 --> 01:16:08,830
Help me!

936
01:16:11,067 --> 01:16:13,201
Fuck! Oh, fuck.

937
01:16:13,202 --> 01:16:15,771
- What the fuck happened?
- Man, I was nervous.

938
01:16:16,272 --> 01:16:19,941
<i>- Gordon to Davis.</i>
- Hold on.

939
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:23,035
- Davis, go.
<i>- How do I explain this?</i>

940
01:16:23,036 --> 01:16:25,347
<i>- I have an 11-71.</i>
- Shit.

941
01:16:25,348 --> 01:16:27,415
<i>I think you should get
over here right now.</i>

942
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:30,252
I'm on my way. Okay...

943
01:16:30,253 --> 01:16:35,722
I need you to stay in this
spot, okay? I'll be right back.

944
01:16:39,027 --> 01:16:41,997
Plant this in his hands. We'll just
say it was self-defense, all right?

945
01:16:41,998 --> 01:16:46,000
All right, cool. Good
looking out, man.

946
01:16:49,004 --> 01:16:53,373
Dex, look at this. How am
I supposed to say that?

947
01:16:56,912 --> 01:17:00,347
Some weird shit going on here, man.

948
01:17:49,998 --> 01:17:53,867
This can't be the guy.
Wasn't this guy missing an eye?

949
01:18:04,681 --> 01:18:08,215
Get over here right now.

950
01:18:24,599 --> 01:18:27,135
Take that, motherfucker!

951
01:18:57,098 --> 01:19:00,200
Come back here, you bitch!

952
01:19:04,172 --> 01:19:07,341
I'll gut ya like a pig!

953
01:19:19,521 --> 01:19:23,693
I'll turn your insides
into sausage!

954
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:43,176
<i>♪ Row, row, row your boat ♪</i>

955
01:20:03,532 --> 01:20:05,200
No!

956
01:20:05,201 --> 01:20:08,570
No!

957
01:20:13,509 --> 01:20:15,210
Please!

958
01:20:17,546 --> 01:20:19,547
Please!

959
01:20:19,548 --> 01:20:23,784
Get over here right now.

960
01:20:25,221 --> 01:20:27,455
Please!

961
01:20:33,028 --> 01:20:35,862
Get over here right now.

962
01:20:41,069 --> 01:20:43,637
Uncle Vito!

963
01:20:54,516 --> 01:20:56,051
Uncle Vito!

964
01:20:58,887 --> 01:21:03,491
He was gonna kill me, just like
he killed Dina and everyone else.

965
01:21:03,492 --> 01:21:07,328
- Everything's gonna be all right.
- How did you get here so fast?

966
01:21:07,329 --> 01:21:09,897
When Edgar called, we
knew something was wrong.

967
01:21:09,898 --> 01:21:11,099
Edgar?

968
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:14,193
Last week, two of my guys went missing
down here, and when you called,

969
01:21:14,219 --> 01:21:18,073
said you were coming down for the weekend,
I asked Edgar to keep an eye on you.

970
01:21:18,574 --> 01:21:21,509
He left me this message
an hour before you called.

971
01:21:22,163 --> 01:21:25,647
<i>Mr. V., my brother's lost
his fuckin' mind today.</i>

972
01:21:25,648 --> 01:21:28,716
<i>Turned our barn into a
fuckin' slaughterhouse.</i>

973
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:31,119
<i>Give me the phone, you big idiot.</i>

974
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:32,420
<i>Troy, no!</i>

975
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:36,858
Oh, my God.

976
01:21:37,459 --> 01:21:42,197
Promise me I'll never have
to see this place again.

977
01:21:42,598 --> 01:21:45,433
- Please.
- I promise, Princess.

978
01:21:45,434 --> 01:21:49,203
Never again. Never again!

979
01:22:08,290 --> 01:22:11,894
It's so beautiful out here, and
I love all this nature, but...

980
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:14,162
don't you miss your beach
house down by the shore?

981
01:22:14,163 --> 01:22:17,799
What beach house? After the
storm, there was nothing left.

982
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:21,336
So I took the insurance money,
and I bought all of this.

983
01:22:21,337 --> 01:22:24,172
No way. You own all of this?

984
01:22:24,173 --> 01:22:27,417
- This must have cost you a fortune.
- A fortune?

985
01:22:27,443 --> 01:22:32,249
A fortune? The little mobster who used
to own it was so anxious to sell it,

986
01:22:32,275 --> 01:22:38,381
he practically gave it away. So I wound up
spending pennies to buy a fully renovated,

987
01:22:38,382 --> 01:22:41,999
cool-as-balls home with a lake!

988
01:22:42,525 --> 01:22:45,226
Tell me I'm not the
luckiest guy in the world.

989
01:22:45,227 --> 01:22:47,861
That's why I like you, Ronnie.

990
01:22:49,764 --> 01:22:52,834
'Cause you're smart
<i>and</i> you're classy.

991
01:22:55,538 --> 01:22:59,839
Ohh... life is good.

992
01:23:13,688 --> 01:23:18,126
Oh, my God! That's a huge gun!

993
01:23:18,627 --> 01:23:22,128
And it's always fully loaded.

994
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:54,562
Here, little puppy.

995
01:23:54,763 --> 01:23:58,466
Come out, come out
