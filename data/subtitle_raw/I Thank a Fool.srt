1
00:01:52,795 --> 00:01:54,308
The doctor is here.

2
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:37,481
How is he?
- Not too good today, dear.

3
00:02:37,845 --> 00:02:39,621
Still, we expect that, don't we?

4
00:02:40,422 --> 00:02:42,108
It won't be long if you ask my opinion.

5
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,587
No sleep?
- No.

6
00:02:47,523 --> 00:02:50,056
Get the injection ready.
- Yes. Straight away.

7
00:02:59,398 --> 00:03:03,175
Darling .. remember your promise.

8
00:03:25,336 --> 00:03:27,892
At 4 o'clock he had one sixth of a gram?
- Yes, dear.

9
00:03:28,393 --> 00:03:31,635
I'll give an intravenous.
- I can do it myself you know.

10
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:33,604
It should be done by a doctor.

11
00:03:33,873 --> 00:03:36,873
I have had enough experience.
I can do it perfectly well.

12
00:03:37,128 --> 00:03:38,229
Get him ready please.

13
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:39,811
Oh.

14
00:04:00,052 --> 00:04:01,126
It's alright.

15
00:04:04,334 --> 00:04:05,320
We are ready now.

16
00:04:14,244 --> 00:04:15,586
He'll sleep now.

17
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,065
You see, I took quite
a fancy to Mr Benson.

18
00:04:32,265 --> 00:04:34,168
Since he first came
up here to Liverpool.

19
00:04:34,444 --> 00:04:35,933
Such a nice man.

20
00:04:36,353 --> 00:04:38,914
And so good-looking too.
For a professor.

21
00:04:39,764 --> 00:04:42,571
It was a mercy really he
was saved that suffering.

22
00:04:43,053 --> 00:04:44,216
But it was sudden.

23
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,640
After that injection she
gave him, he went to sleep.

24
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:51,177
Of course, it could have
been coincidental.

25
00:04:51,623 --> 00:04:54,896
All she said was 'he should sleep now'.

26
00:04:56,905 --> 00:04:59,532
I thought at the time that there was
something in the way she said it.

27
00:04:59,809 --> 00:05:03,332
Something peculiar. And then she
would give the injection herself.

28
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:07,407
I could have done it. I could
have done it perfectly well.

29
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,765
I've had a great deal of experience.

30
00:05:10,405 --> 00:05:12,656
I was a bronze medal at St Mary's.

31
00:05:14,295 --> 00:05:16,226
But she insisted on doing it herself.

32
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:18,576
And the injection proved fatal.

33
00:05:19,756 --> 00:05:20,987
Thank you, nurse Drew.

34
00:05:21,294 --> 00:05:23,179
That is the case for the
Prosecution, My Lord.

35
00:05:25,702 --> 00:05:28,710
My Lord .. I call Dr Christine Allison.

36
00:05:43,952 --> 00:05:46,790
Take the book in your right hand.
Repeat what is printed on the card.

37
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,815
She doesn't look like a criminal.

38
00:05:49,192 --> 00:05:51,583
Perhaps you can tell me
what <i>does</i> a criminal look like?

39
00:05:52,615 --> 00:05:54,700
The whole truth and
nothing but the truth.

40
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,840
You are doctor Christine Mary Allison?

41
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,154
Yes.

42
00:06:03,582 --> 00:06:04,508
Dr Allison.

43
00:06:04,982 --> 00:06:06,601
Are you able to tell us exactly ..

44
00:06:06,701 --> 00:06:09,407
The size of the last injection
you gave Mr Benson?

45
00:06:10,283 --> 00:06:12,048
No.
- Why is that?

46
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:17,288
I usually enter the amount of drugs
I give in the drug book, but ..

47
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,152
I couldn't.
- Why?

48
00:06:20,574 --> 00:06:22,659
The bottle broke.
- By accident?

49
00:06:23,198 --> 00:06:24,293
By accident.

50
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:29,676
Is it possible that you may have
misjudged the size of the injection?

51
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:31,724
I suppose it is just possible.

52
00:06:32,374 --> 00:06:35,996
Doctor Allison .. I want you to
turn to members of the jury.

53
00:06:36,633 --> 00:06:37,935
And tell them this.

54
00:06:39,193 --> 00:06:42,330
Did you .. knowingly murder John Benson?

55
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:46,643
No.

56
00:06:47,413 --> 00:06:48,727
I did not murder him.

57
00:06:50,324 --> 00:06:51,835
Thank you, doctor Allison.

58
00:06:52,748 --> 00:06:55,762
Just a few questions, doctor Allison,
before you step down.

59
00:06:56,531 --> 00:06:58,459
I understand that you
were born in Canada?

60
00:06:58,774 --> 00:07:01,294
Yes. Winnipeg.
- Your father was not a man of means?

61
00:07:01,616 --> 00:07:03,342
No.
- What was his job?

62
00:07:04,044 --> 00:07:06,901
He was a janitor.
- What we would call a handyman. I see.

63
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,301
Is this all relevant
in some way, Mr Dane?

64
00:07:10,905 --> 00:07:12,226
It will become so, My Lord.

65
00:07:12,384 --> 00:07:14,780
And with the help of this
janitor father of yours.

66
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,516
You studied medicine at McGill
University and qualified there?

67
00:07:19,395 --> 00:07:21,952
My father couldn't help me.
He died when I was twelve.

68
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,234
I worked my way through McGill.

69
00:07:24,771 --> 00:07:27,933
Having there formed a close
friendship with a teacher of philosophy?

70
00:07:28,431 --> 00:07:31,370
I have many friends.
- I refer to the late Mr Benson.

71
00:07:32,545 --> 00:07:33,522
Now ..

72
00:07:34,103 --> 00:07:37,090
Three years ago you came
to Liverpool. Why was that?

73
00:07:37,463 --> 00:07:40,151
My mother had died. I was all
alone and I needed a change.

74
00:07:40,955 --> 00:07:43,879
Before you reduce us all to tears ..
- My Lord, I object.

75
00:07:44,203 --> 00:07:45,963
That was a completely
unnecessary comment.

76
00:07:46,209 --> 00:07:48,140
And that's a completely
unnecessary interruption.

77
00:07:48,332 --> 00:07:50,648
My learned friend has a well-known
talent for being offensive.

78
00:07:50,748 --> 00:07:52,822
I refuse to be interrupted
during a cross-examination.

79
00:07:52,974 --> 00:07:53,863
Gentlemen!

80
00:07:54,496 --> 00:07:57,082
I think we must let Mr Dane
take his own course.

81
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:58,580
Mr O'Grady?

82
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,115
Very well, My Lord.

83
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:01,880
I am obliged, My Lord.

84
00:08:02,907 --> 00:08:04,509
And I suppose that ..

85
00:08:04,843 --> 00:08:09,434
Your journey here had nothing to do with
Mr Benson working at the university?

86
00:08:09,945 --> 00:08:11,635
He encouraged me to come and work here.

87
00:08:11,855 --> 00:08:15,708
I see. But he didn't encourage Maria
Benson to come here, did he Dr Allison?

88
00:08:16,183 --> 00:08:17,653
Who .. Mr Dane?

89
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:22,047
Mrs Benson, My Lord. To whom the
dead man had been married since 1948.

90
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:24,141
No. She didn't come.

91
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,291
Were they unhappy together?

92
00:08:27,118 --> 00:08:29,723
We never talked about that.
- Did you not?

93
00:08:30,723 --> 00:08:32,792
No doubt you had other
things to talk about.

94
00:08:33,021 --> 00:08:37,385
And your conversation was not confined
to philosophy, was it Dr Allison?

95
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:40,676
In fact.

96
00:08:41,407 --> 00:08:43,949
He had been your lover
before you left Canada.

97
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,189
Ever since then, I suggest you had
been Mr John Benson's mistress.

98
00:08:49,343 --> 00:08:52,200
If you want to use those words.
- They are true, are they not?

99
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:55,449
I'd like to be clear
about this, Dr Allison.

100
00:08:56,179 --> 00:09:00,756
You had an adulterous association with
this man up to the time of his death.

101
00:09:02,662 --> 00:09:03,482
Yes.

102
00:09:03,763 --> 00:09:05,319
And yet you acted as his doctor?

103
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:08,672
He wanted me to. He asked me ..

104
00:09:10,098 --> 00:09:11,576
We agreed on it between us.

105
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:14,286
You agreed on what, Dr Allison?

106
00:09:15,086 --> 00:09:16,953
On what, did you agree together?

107
00:09:17,214 --> 00:09:19,554
That I should treat him. In his illness.

108
00:09:19,814 --> 00:09:22,051
Wasn't there something
else you agreed upon?

109
00:09:23,356 --> 00:09:24,059
What?

110
00:09:24,789 --> 00:09:27,357
He asked you to kill him, did he not?

111
00:09:31,454 --> 00:09:34,534
Your agreement was, you should release
him from his life whenever he asked you.

112
00:09:34,753 --> 00:09:37,050
You said that it was quite easy.
- I never said that.

113
00:09:37,753 --> 00:09:39,294
I only said he was my patient.

114
00:09:41,884 --> 00:09:44,596
On your own admission,
your family were not well off.

115
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:45,570
No.

116
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,111
Therefore, money matters have
always been important to you.

117
00:09:48,511 --> 00:09:50,720
I suppose so.
- Then this should interest you.

118
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,438
This is the probate of
the will of John Benson.

119
00:09:54,062 --> 00:09:56,646
He left you all his property.
You know that?

120
00:09:57,256 --> 00:10:01,378
And nothing to his wife. You stood
to gain directly, by this man's death.

121
00:10:02,232 --> 00:10:03,426
Stood to gain?

122
00:10:04,376 --> 00:10:07,303
I stood to gain?
- Yes! Financially.

123
00:10:08,202 --> 00:10:09,531
Is that what you mean?

124
00:10:10,155 --> 00:10:11,922
A few pounds he'd saved.

125
00:10:12,257 --> 00:10:16,420
Some books that now seem to me as
meaningless as your foolish questions.

126
00:10:16,823 --> 00:10:18,662
A pair of gold cuff-links?

127
00:10:20,008 --> 00:10:22,645
Is that what you mean?
The cuff-links I gave him?

128
00:10:22,964 --> 00:10:24,353
I gave them to him.

129
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,597
And now I've got them back.

130
00:10:27,617 --> 00:10:30,985
If you are unable to go on now,
I'm quite sure we can wait.

131
00:10:32,077 --> 00:10:34,849
Thank you very much,
but I'm quite alright.

132
00:10:50,948 --> 00:10:52,271
Members of the jury.

133
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:57,041
You may feel that the evidence you have
heard does not support the probability.

134
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:00,524
That the overdose was
administered by pure accident.

135
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,186
And if the overdose was
deliberately administered.

136
00:11:05,101 --> 00:11:06,561
Let me remind you of this.

137
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:10,110
It is no defence that this
man was mortally ill.

138
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,350
Or that he wished to die.

139
00:11:13,283 --> 00:11:14,974
No-one, members of the jury ..

140
00:11:15,351 --> 00:11:17,819
Has the right to bestow
the gift of life and death.

141
00:11:19,193 --> 00:11:20,553
On the other hand.

142
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,886
If you are satisfied, that
she had no intent to kill.

143
00:11:24,577 --> 00:11:27,482
But was criminally negligent in the
way that she treated her patient.

144
00:11:28,483 --> 00:11:31,999
Then you will find her guilty of
the lesser crime of manslaughter.

145
00:11:34,035 --> 00:11:36,041
You will now consider your verdict.

146
00:11:40,007 --> 00:11:41,380
Mercy killing verdict.

147
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,620
What will they give you, dear?
- Huh?

148
00:11:58,091 --> 00:11:59,628
I said how much did they give you?

149
00:12:01,133 --> 00:12:02,127
Two years.

150
00:12:03,103 --> 00:12:04,432
Mercy killing, was it?

151
00:12:05,969 --> 00:12:07,353
They called in manslaughter.

152
00:12:13,398 --> 00:12:16,088
You'll be out in eighteen
months. You're a good con.

153
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,525
You're bound to be. I mean,
you being a doctor and all.

154
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,634
Quiet there!

155
00:12:19,977 --> 00:12:21,330
A bloody doctor, is she?

156
00:12:22,148 --> 00:12:25,007
She never got down on her knees
and scrubbed out the surgery.

157
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:28,086
It will be a bit of a chance for
her when she gets inside.

158
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,255
A bigger change when she gets out.

159
00:12:30,688 --> 00:12:33,824
I mean, you and me can always pick up
where we left off, can't we, Maisie?

160
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,755
I said no talking. Shut up.

161
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:51,953

You've had some nursing
experience, you say?

174
00:13:47,456 --> 00:13:48,868
But no diploma?

175
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,279
I can't recommend you without
a diploma now, can I.

176
00:13:54,848 --> 00:13:57,286
Have you any special
aptitude of any sort?

177
00:13:57,918 --> 00:13:58,772
No.

178
00:13:59,722 --> 00:14:01,090
I'm very sorry.

179
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,764
Most of my patients are women.

180
00:14:09,731 --> 00:14:11,625
They pay in cash or kind.

181
00:14:13,165 --> 00:14:15,113
No trouble with the charming tax.

182
00:14:16,433 --> 00:14:18,001
You'll find me easy to get on with.

183
00:14:19,037 --> 00:14:20,221
I like redheads.

184
00:14:21,316 --> 00:14:22,639
Here, where are you off to?

185
00:14:23,773 --> 00:14:26,582
You haven't been planted on me by
the charming authorities, have you?

186
00:14:31,815 --> 00:14:33,865
May I see your National Insurance card?

187
00:14:34,718 --> 00:14:36,005
Fully stamped, I hope.

188
00:14:36,882 --> 00:14:37,770
Oh.

189
00:14:38,915 --> 00:14:40,393
May I see your references?

190
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,382
I see.

191
00:14:48,663 --> 00:14:51,461
I'm afraid we're rather particular
about our girls here.

192
00:14:51,742 --> 00:14:52,738
Good afternoon.

193
00:15:24,672 --> 00:15:25,956
[ Door knocks ]

194
00:15:27,672 --> 00:15:29,438
There is a telephone call for you.

195
00:15:30,487 --> 00:15:32,801
For me?
- Well, that's what they said.

196
00:15:40,491 --> 00:15:41,439
Hello.

197
00:15:42,758 --> 00:15:43,667
Who?

198
00:15:45,161 --> 00:15:46,234
Who are you?

199
00:15:48,055 --> 00:15:49,172
You know me?

200
00:15:49,806 --> 00:15:51,093
You know all about me?

201
00:15:54,428 --> 00:15:55,412
Meet you where?

202
00:16:47,665 --> 00:16:49,903
Are you Miss Godden?
- Yes.

203
00:16:50,495 --> 00:16:51,617
I'm Miss Chandler.

204
00:16:52,122 --> 00:16:53,720
'Aunt Heather' to everybody.

205
00:16:54,259 --> 00:16:55,913
I phoned you this afternoon.

206
00:16:56,661 --> 00:16:58,249
How did you hear about me?

207
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:01,227
Well, some people we
knew were very kind.

208
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,091
But it took us some time to find you.

209
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,960
My nephew is so anxious to see you.

210
00:17:08,443 --> 00:17:10,431
Shall we go and find my car?

211
00:17:12,516 --> 00:17:14,950
I put it down here somewhere.

212
00:17:15,574 --> 00:17:16,739
Ah yes, there it is.

213
00:17:24,424 --> 00:17:28,085
You see how small and
inconspicuous my little car is.

214
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:32,353
Yet you know, it is always attracting
the attention of the city police.

215
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:35,875
Do get in and let us drive
out of this windy town.

216
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,321
Where are we going?
- You'll see.

217
00:18:00,101 --> 00:18:01,243
Is it very far?

218
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:07,736
These buses, they do loom up at you.

219
00:18:09,968 --> 00:18:11,298
How have you been getting on?

220
00:18:11,932 --> 00:18:14,541
It's been difficult for you
to find work, hasn't it.

221
00:18:16,358 --> 00:18:17,467
Your nephew, he ..

222
00:18:19,103 --> 00:18:21,277
He doesn't mind about
what's happened to me?

223
00:18:21,662 --> 00:18:24,287
What's that, there?
- It's a red light, Miss Chandler.

224
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:27,978
How sudden they are.

225
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,905
No. My nephew likes to
help people in distress.

226
00:18:32,591 --> 00:18:34,849
He does these kind acts quite secretly.

227
00:18:36,136 --> 00:18:38,679
Now you. You've changed
your name, haven't you?

228
00:18:39,207 --> 00:18:40,346
Yes, I have.

229
00:18:41,741 --> 00:18:42,937
Not that it matters.

230
00:18:47,247 --> 00:18:48,295
Men drivers.

231
00:19:44,179 --> 00:19:46,009
This house is the devil to run.

232
00:19:46,968 --> 00:19:48,947
My nephew likes it out here.

233
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,085
But it's the devil to run.

234
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,391
The servants won't stay.

235
00:19:57,657 --> 00:19:59,460
You know how it is these days.

236
00:20:03,582 --> 00:20:05,554
Oh, my nephew grew those.

237
00:20:05,895 --> 00:20:07,058
He breeds them.

238
00:20:07,428 --> 00:20:08,929
I haven't time for flowers.

239
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:11,610
I'll go and see if I can find him.

240
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:33,799
Evil looking things, aren't they.

241
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:37,574
Personally, I prefer wild flowers.

242
00:20:38,453 --> 00:20:39,876
Do you come to join the family?

243
00:20:41,497 --> 00:20:42,436
I think so.

244
00:20:42,834 --> 00:20:43,525
Good.

245
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:46,454
There is a cinema eight miles away.

246
00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:49,397
And, there is a bus into
Liverpool three times a week.

247
00:20:49,835 --> 00:20:51,823
So I don't suppose you
will die of excitement.

248
00:20:52,053 --> 00:20:55,022
But I haven't been taken on yet.
I've only met Miss Chandler.

249
00:20:55,393 --> 00:20:57,433
Oh, then the worst is still to come.

250
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:00,288
But you look like you'll survive it.
- Thanks.

251
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:02,337
I hope you've brought
plenty of knitting.

252
00:21:02,992 --> 00:21:03,750
Knitting?

253
00:21:04,488 --> 00:21:07,324
The evenings in this place are longer
than anywhere else in the world.

254
00:21:08,053 --> 00:21:09,670
Good luck with the master of the house.

255
00:21:10,576 --> 00:21:11,538
Is he ..

256
00:21:12,142 --> 00:21:14,234
Very alarming?
- Oh no.

257
00:21:17,221 --> 00:21:18,551
He is really very kind.

258
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:20,849
To flowers.

259
00:21:35,407 --> 00:21:36,716
Miss Godden?

260
00:21:37,099 --> 00:21:38,363
I found him for you.

261
00:21:39,102 --> 00:21:41,439
I always know where to look for him.

262
00:21:45,758 --> 00:21:48,005
He's always in here
when he's not at work.

263
00:21:49,025 --> 00:21:50,760
Of course, he hasn't much time.

264
00:21:51,146 --> 00:21:53,042
But he loves his flowers.

265
00:21:56,283 --> 00:21:57,448
Miss Godden is here.

266
00:21:57,999 --> 00:21:59,415
This is my nephew.

267
00:21:59,697 --> 00:22:01,308
I'll leave you to get acquainted.

268
00:22:16,592 --> 00:22:17,832
I thought you'd remember.

269
00:22:18,228 --> 00:22:19,721
Will someone drive me back.

270
00:22:21,017 --> 00:22:23,851
I want you to listen to me.
- I had to listen to you before.

271
00:22:24,272 --> 00:22:26,172
I was in a position where
I couldn't avoid it.

272
00:22:26,771 --> 00:22:29,154
Didn't you get enough
pleasure out of torturing me?

273
00:22:29,736 --> 00:22:31,249
I was only doing what I had to do.

274
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:34,928
Now sit down. Let's discuss this.
- What a sense of humour.

275
00:22:35,561 --> 00:22:37,542
As far as I'm concerned,
the past is over.

276
00:22:38,305 --> 00:22:39,464
I'm offering you a job.

277
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:41,771
I would rather scrub floors.

278
00:22:44,564 --> 00:22:45,323
Please.

279
00:22:46,046 --> 00:22:47,292
Listen to me for a moment.

280
00:22:48,479 --> 00:22:49,875
I believe that I can trust you.

281
00:22:50,129 --> 00:22:51,916
I was removed from the medical register.

282
00:22:52,127 --> 00:22:54,079
For outrageous and immoral conduct.

283
00:22:55,286 --> 00:22:56,951
Nevertheless, I can still trust you.

284
00:22:58,417 --> 00:23:02,410
We are all capable of doing something
that the law doesn't approve of.

285
00:23:03,932 --> 00:23:06,736
I was in a position to observe
you in a difficult situation.

286
00:23:08,463 --> 00:23:10,139
You observed me?

287
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,038
I thought that you had
courage and character.

288
00:23:13,776 --> 00:23:14,849
Give me a reference.

289
00:23:15,378 --> 00:23:17,640
You can't waste your life on
the sort of job you'll get now.

290
00:23:17,806 --> 00:23:19,651
You need a chance to
practice your profession.

291
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:21,305
Just what does that mean?

292
00:23:23,621 --> 00:23:24,984
My wife is an invalid.

293
00:23:26,102 --> 00:23:27,217
Why me?

294
00:23:28,133 --> 00:23:29,578
Why have you been looking for me?

295
00:23:30,692 --> 00:23:31,536
Well, she ..

296
00:23:32,523 --> 00:23:34,171
Some time ago she had a car accident.

297
00:23:35,673 --> 00:23:37,933
I'm afraid that her brain was damaged.

298
00:23:39,473 --> 00:23:41,356
She needs somebody to look after her.

299
00:23:42,069 --> 00:23:43,754
She can never be left alone.

300
00:23:44,681 --> 00:23:46,581
And her life has to be
severely restricted.

301
00:23:47,654 --> 00:23:49,506
But she mustn't be
made to feel a prisoner.

302
00:23:51,075 --> 00:23:52,308
Do you understand that?

303
00:23:52,836 --> 00:23:55,115
Where I come from, they
weren't quite so tactful.

304
00:23:55,686 --> 00:23:56,745
I'm sorry.

305
00:23:57,482 --> 00:23:59,238
I see no reason to dwell on your past.

306
00:23:59,626 --> 00:24:01,807
If your wife is an invalid
she needs a nurse.

307
00:24:02,195 --> 00:24:04,510
There are plenty around.
- We've had some of them.

308
00:24:05,106 --> 00:24:07,581
All that my wife needs is a companion.
Someone that understands her.

309
00:24:07,922 --> 00:24:09,767
She's quite an attractive
person in many ways.

310
00:24:10,218 --> 00:24:12,305
What do you say?
- I've told you.

311
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:15,384
My car!

312
00:24:20,378 --> 00:24:21,461
Liane!

313
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:25,059
Don't you pay attention
to anything I say?

314
00:24:25,354 --> 00:24:26,333
Are you alright?

315
00:24:26,433 --> 00:24:28,473
What a stupid way to build a garage.

316
00:24:29,649 --> 00:24:31,891
I told you before. I never want
to see you in a car again.

317
00:24:31,991 --> 00:24:33,513
Bring some antiseptic and bandages.

318
00:24:34,748 --> 00:24:36,053
The bruises are not too bad.

319
00:24:36,153 --> 00:24:38,141
Please don't interfere.
I can take care of my wife.

320
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:39,980
Your wife?

321
00:24:40,842 --> 00:24:41,608
Yes.

322
00:24:42,312 --> 00:24:43,728
Now perhaps you will understand.

323
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,057
No.

324
00:24:45,575 --> 00:24:47,849
Come with me. We'll take a
closer look at that head of yours.

325
00:24:48,977 --> 00:24:49,935
What shall I do?

326
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:52,288
Take them upstairs and do anything
Miss Godden asks you to.

327
00:24:52,993 --> 00:24:54,759
She is going to take care of Liane now.

328
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,847
A little more?

329
00:25:06,027 --> 00:25:08,301
Thank you very much, aunt Heather.
It's absolutely delicious.

330
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:09,962
I'm flattered.
- Thank you.

331
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:13,840
Miss Godden, how do you like
living in the north of England?

332
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:17,329
I used to practice law in London,
you know. Mostly divorces.

333
00:25:17,788 --> 00:25:20,761
Actresses ringing up in the middle
of the night to ask my advice on ..

334
00:25:20,982 --> 00:25:23,239
Small problems of personal inadequacy.

335
00:25:23,595 --> 00:25:24,501
Lucky fellow.

336
00:25:24,818 --> 00:25:27,685
Up here it's all fatal accidents
and violent crime.

337
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,076
I miss the south.

338
00:25:29,418 --> 00:25:31,292
I've been told that the
north is more friendly.

339
00:25:31,469 --> 00:25:32,227
Have you?

340
00:25:33,053 --> 00:25:35,412
You know, I get the feeling
that we've met before.

341
00:25:35,876 --> 00:25:36,892
You couldn't have.

342
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:39,243
Miss Godden is Canadian.
She's only just come to England.

343
00:25:39,527 --> 00:25:41,672
Perhaps I'd better go upstairs
and see how your wife is.

344
00:25:41,772 --> 00:25:44,761
No. She should rest.
More wine, anybody?

345
00:25:45,213 --> 00:25:46,642
A glass for me, please.

346
00:25:48,094 --> 00:25:49,735
Liane, you are supposed to be resting.

347
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,549
I'm beautiful.

348
00:25:51,918 --> 00:25:53,453
That's what you're supposed to say.

349
00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:54,815
I'll say it for him.

350
00:25:55,548 --> 00:25:57,565
These lawyers, they always
stick up for one another.

351
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,573
But that's not the same thing at all.

352
00:25:59,673 --> 00:26:02,062
You're like my husband.
- You're a realist, Mrs Dane.

353
00:26:02,506 --> 00:26:04,312
Stephen, you have a realist for a wife.

354
00:26:04,412 --> 00:26:05,951
Why didn't you stay in your room?

355
00:26:06,465 --> 00:26:07,795
I'm quite alright, thank you.

356
00:26:08,646 --> 00:26:10,060
In fact, I'm happy.

357
00:26:11,021 --> 00:26:13,440
So many people .. it's almost a party.

358
00:26:15,411 --> 00:26:17,101
Have you met my new friend, Christine?

359
00:26:17,286 --> 00:26:18,336
Most charming.

360
00:26:18,691 --> 00:26:21,541
Aunt Heather, don't you think you should
take the ladies into the sitting room?

361
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:27,362
You just want rid of us so you and
Mr Ebblington can tell dirty stories.

362
00:26:28,069 --> 00:26:29,396
I'm afraid I don't know any.

363
00:26:29,496 --> 00:26:31,357
Ah, then you'll have
a very dull time of it.

364
00:26:31,836 --> 00:26:34,579
Stephen has forgotten most of
his stories. Isn't that right, darling?

365
00:26:35,091 --> 00:26:37,108
He's been so busy with all
those murders and things.

366
00:26:37,995 --> 00:26:39,938
Now I remember once at Curragh.
- Liane.

367
00:26:40,106 --> 00:26:42,283
The house in Ireland where
I was born and raised.

368
00:26:42,692 --> 00:26:45,655
I remember when the big white doors
would shut on the gentlemen.

369
00:26:46,492 --> 00:26:48,102
I'd listen to what they were doing.

370
00:26:48,322 --> 00:26:51,041
They talked and drank until all hours.

371
00:26:51,736 --> 00:26:54,418
I remember once, my
father got so crazy ..

372
00:26:54,691 --> 00:26:57,216
He brought one of the horses
into the dining room.

373
00:26:57,409 --> 00:26:59,689
And I swear he gave it a bottle of port.

374
00:27:01,234 --> 00:27:02,266
Oh, I'm sorry.

375
00:27:05,487 --> 00:27:08,698
The whole county was talking about
Captain Ferris and his drunken horse.

376
00:27:10,669 --> 00:27:11,742
Mr Ebblington.

377
00:27:12,816 --> 00:27:14,661
Promise me you'll never
do anything like that.

378
00:27:14,822 --> 00:27:16,799
Would you take my wife
to her room, please.

379
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,839
Come on, Liane. I'd like to hear
more about your house in Ireland.

380
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,053
Honest?
- Yes.

381
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:28,191
Really?

382
00:27:30,466 --> 00:27:31,481
Come on then.

383
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,635
I'll tell you all about it.

384
00:27:42,736 --> 00:27:43,866
[ Telephone ]

385
00:27:45,424 --> 00:27:46,345
[ Telephone ]

386
00:28:07,472 --> 00:28:08,730
[ Voices outside room ]

387
00:29:05,822 --> 00:29:07,003
Did you sleep well?

388
00:29:07,186 --> 00:29:09,969
I found it difficult to get back to
sleep after the telephone rang.

389
00:29:10,879 --> 00:29:12,124
Oh, I didn't hear it.

390
00:29:12,894 --> 00:29:14,988
I didn't hear the phone.
You must have been dreaming.

391
00:29:21,474 --> 00:29:23,834
Liane is going riding this morning.
I'd like you to go with her.

392
00:29:24,226 --> 00:29:26,386
I've lent my stables to a man
who keeps a riding school.

393
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,252
You won't let her out
of your sight will you.

394
00:29:30,637 --> 00:29:32,161
She is not to be trusted.

395
00:29:46,365 --> 00:29:47,490
No. Keep away!

396
00:29:51,054 --> 00:29:52,849
I can't stand men pulling me about.

397
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,880
I don't even let Stephen do it.

398
00:29:56,064 --> 00:29:57,049
Poor Stephen.

399
00:29:57,533 --> 00:29:59,002
Isn't that a terrible thing?

400
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:04,318
Why, you two haven't me. This is Roscoe.

401
00:30:05,032 --> 00:30:06,287
He's from Ireland, too.

402
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,650
From County Cork.

403
00:30:08,081 --> 00:30:09,783
A breeding ground for
rogues and rascals.

404
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:11,790
She's a great one for flattery.

405
00:30:12,295 --> 00:30:14,111
Maybe it isn't flattery.
Maybe she means it.

406
00:30:14,525 --> 00:30:16,127
Now that's the kind of woman I like.

407
00:30:16,227 --> 00:30:17,871
Come on, Roscoe. Enough of that blarney.

408
00:30:23,881 --> 00:30:24,643
Roscoe.

409
00:30:25,295 --> 00:30:28,154
Can't these tired old riding-school
nags of yours go any faster?

410
00:30:28,374 --> 00:30:31,158
She wants to be sailing over a
high stone wall on a stallion.

411
00:30:31,716 --> 00:30:33,110
Drunk with Irish whiskey.

412
00:30:33,687 --> 00:30:36,114
Isn't that what you're longing
for Mrs Dane: the Curragh hunt?

413
00:30:36,951 --> 00:30:38,878
They know how to ride where I come from.

414
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,093
You talk as though you'd
like to go back there.

415
00:30:41,402 --> 00:30:44,427
Stephen would never let me.
He's jealous of me and my father.

416
00:31:06,774 --> 00:31:08,824
Liane .. turn your horse away.

417
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:25,366
Well, did you enjoy the ride, Christine?
- Yes, but I'll be stiff for a week.

418
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:27,674
It's always like that if you
haven't ridden for some time.

419
00:31:27,774 --> 00:31:29,275
Would you like an apple?
- Thanks.

420
00:31:29,705 --> 00:31:31,937
Well Christine, do you think
you're going to like it here?

421
00:31:32,037 --> 00:31:33,932
Oh yes. This place is lovely.

422
00:31:34,983 --> 00:31:37,153
It's not as nice as at Curragh.
It's not near the sea.

423
00:31:37,753 --> 00:31:39,570
In Curragh, the house is
much more beautiful.

424
00:31:41,055 --> 00:31:42,489
Liane.
- Yes?

425
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,846
You know when you stopped your horse
back there when the saw was spinning?

426
00:31:48,814 --> 00:31:50,340
I don't really remember.

427
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,398
Do you often feel like that?

428
00:31:54,831 --> 00:31:55,923
Feel like what?

429
00:31:56,161 --> 00:31:58,465
Like you want to watch
something .. going around.

430
00:32:02,158 --> 00:32:04,023
Christine, I don't know what you mean.

431
00:32:48,315 --> 00:32:49,703
The whodunits are over there.

432
00:32:50,205 --> 00:32:51,821
Unless you're looking for love stories.

433
00:32:52,166 --> 00:32:54,495
No, I wasn't.
- Good. I haven't got any.

434
00:32:55,615 --> 00:32:57,253
As a matter of fact, I was looking ..

435
00:32:57,353 --> 00:32:59,142
Looking through my
collection of murders.

436
00:32:59,242 --> 00:33:02,733
That's the worst of our trade. We tend
to make a collection of guns and knives.

437
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,347
Pictures of men with sad eyes.

438
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,990
Who finished off their wives
for the funeral benefits.

439
00:33:08,618 --> 00:33:10,086
That's Smithson, the poisoner.

440
00:33:10,702 --> 00:33:11,775
Do you remember him?

441
00:33:11,925 --> 00:33:13,788
I'm not interested in
your cases, Mr Dane.

442
00:33:14,106 --> 00:33:14,906
I'm sorry.

443
00:33:15,665 --> 00:33:17,154
Most of them are rather boring.

444
00:33:18,181 --> 00:33:21,816
For example, I have to cross-examine
a very astute elderly embezzler.

445
00:33:23,072 --> 00:33:25,016
You'll beat him.
- Do you think so?

446
00:33:25,341 --> 00:33:27,072
All you have to do is
shout loudly enough.

447
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:28,823
Yes.

448
00:33:29,904 --> 00:33:33,043
Mr Dane shouting in court?
I'm sorry. Medical problems.

449
00:33:34,109 --> 00:33:35,980
Your wife and I were ..
- What about my wife?

450
00:33:36,968 --> 00:33:39,021
When we were out riding this morning.

451
00:33:39,176 --> 00:33:41,649
We saw a woodcutting machine.
The wheel was spinning.

452
00:33:43,135 --> 00:33:44,358
It fascinated her.

453
00:33:45,132 --> 00:33:47,086
It hypnotized her.
She couldn't look away.

454
00:33:48,255 --> 00:33:50,170
I seem to remember that's
one of the symptoms ..

455
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:52,911
Of schizophrenia. That's
the word they use isn't it.

456
00:33:59,253 --> 00:34:00,818
I've read that book, too.

457
00:34:01,109 --> 00:34:03,449
Would you like a drink?
- No thank you, Stephen.

458
00:34:06,933 --> 00:34:08,546
Why don't you call in a doctor?

459
00:34:09,301 --> 00:34:10,603
I thought you were a doctor.

460
00:34:12,434 --> 00:34:13,519
I can't treat her.

461
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,656
It doesn't need long, technical terms
to know what's the matter with Liane.

462
00:34:18,778 --> 00:34:20,109
She's just very unhappy.

463
00:34:20,465 --> 00:34:21,479
I can see that.

464
00:34:21,792 --> 00:34:24,903
She had a terrible experience.
I think I ought to tell you.

465
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:31,038
She was .. going home to Curragh
with her father in the car.

466
00:34:32,193 --> 00:34:36,099
The road was wet and the car skidded and
hit one of the walls that they have.

467
00:34:36,688 --> 00:34:37,976
The car overturned.

468
00:34:39,345 --> 00:34:42,459
Liane was only stuck, but her father,
Captain Ferris was killed.

469
00:34:43,955 --> 00:34:45,742
Her father?
- Yes.

470
00:34:48,122 --> 00:34:50,115
Hasn't she talked about him?
She usually does.

471
00:34:51,258 --> 00:34:53,920
Well, she was an only child
and naturally she was ..

472
00:34:54,742 --> 00:34:55,941
Desperately unhappy.

473
00:34:56,123 --> 00:34:58,051
This is more than unhappiness.

474
00:35:26,496 --> 00:35:27,483
What did you say?

475
00:35:27,999 --> 00:35:30,429
I've already said it.
She needs a doctor.

476
00:35:32,637 --> 00:35:33,738
And what will he say?

477
00:35:34,397 --> 00:35:37,189
He would say shut her up. Give her a
rest. Give her a little treatment.

478
00:35:37,289 --> 00:35:38,581
I'm not having her shut up.

479
00:35:38,681 --> 00:35:41,249
Well, she's not free the way things are.
- She's as free as anyone.

480
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:43,366
If you really cared about your wife.

481
00:35:43,466 --> 00:35:45,604
Liane is the only person
that I've ever cared for.

482
00:35:47,495 --> 00:35:49,539
And I'll do anything to
see that she doesn't suffer.

483
00:35:52,352 --> 00:35:54,533
Now you go to bed. Don't worry.

484
00:35:55,959 --> 00:35:58,079
I think someone should
start worrying about your wife.

485
00:35:58,264 --> 00:36:00,617
To try to find out what's
going on in her mind.

486
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:04,648
Alright. Read this and try and
find the right technical phrase.

487
00:36:04,748 --> 00:36:06,856
But I tell you there is only
one thing worrying Liane.

488
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:09,790
And that's the memory of a slippery
road on a wet day in Ireland.

489
00:36:10,392 --> 00:36:11,832
But read that by all means.

490
00:36:12,031 --> 00:36:14,460
And now if you'll excuse me,
I must get on with my embezzlement.

491
00:36:15,848 --> 00:36:17,089
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

492
00:36:36,284 --> 00:36:37,395
Christine.

493
00:36:38,944 --> 00:36:40,732
You've been talking to
Stephen, haven't you?

494
00:36:40,967 --> 00:36:42,353
Yes, for a little while.

495
00:36:43,132 --> 00:36:45,574
He never talked to any of
the others so late at night.

496
00:36:45,938 --> 00:36:48,894
You must be a special favourite.
- Oh, I wouldn't think so.

497
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:56,373
What are you reading?

498
00:36:57,162 --> 00:36:59,903
Oh .. you must be very clever
to understand that stuff.

499
00:37:01,037 --> 00:37:02,215
Oh, I'm brilliant.

500
00:37:03,308 --> 00:37:04,567
Come on in. We'll talk.

501
00:37:06,158 --> 00:37:07,458
Christine.

502
00:37:09,023 --> 00:37:10,179
What did you do?

503
00:37:10,642 --> 00:37:11,783
Before you came here?

504
00:37:12,173 --> 00:37:14,824
Well I .. studied for many, many years.

505
00:37:16,986 --> 00:37:18,435
Well, do you know what I think?

506
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:23,497
I think your talents are going to
be wasted in a place like this.

507
00:37:25,449 --> 00:37:26,358
In fact.

508
00:37:27,067 --> 00:37:29,204
I can't think why you are here at all.

509
00:37:30,946 --> 00:37:33,164
Well, I expect I shall find
out sooner or later.

510
00:37:37,273 --> 00:37:39,638
Oh, the record is stuck.
I'll have to go and change it.

511
00:37:41,804 --> 00:37:45,480
You know, I'm glad that you and Stephen
found something to talk about after all.

512
00:37:45,992 --> 00:37:47,223
He went out you know.

513
00:37:48,024 --> 00:37:49,370
You saw that, didn't you?

514
00:37:50,764 --> 00:37:52,209
Well, I hope you're not jealous.

515
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:55,496
Because he's got a woman in the village.

516
00:37:58,074 --> 00:37:59,927
Liane, why do you say things like that?

517
00:38:00,273 --> 00:38:02,158
Because it's true. Her name is Polly.

518
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,704
She runs the pub.

519
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:05,907
That's why he's been
trying to get rid of me.

520
00:38:13,701 --> 00:38:14,744
Liane.

521
00:38:16,141 --> 00:38:16,975
Liane.

522
00:38:18,871 --> 00:38:21,060
Do you know what those lights are?
Christine, do you know?

523
00:38:21,594 --> 00:38:22,304
No.

524
00:38:23,512 --> 00:38:24,699
They are at the seaside.

525
00:38:25,676 --> 00:38:27,884
Of course, it's only a dirty
old seaside round here.

526
00:38:28,192 --> 00:38:29,579
There's mess all over the sand.

527
00:38:30,154 --> 00:38:32,485
Still, it's prettier.
In the night-time.

528
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:34,871
Do you like fairs?
- Oh yes.

529
00:38:35,319 --> 00:38:36,651
I used to go to the fair.

530
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:39,685
We went to sell horses but
we stayed to celebrate.

531
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:41,036
Let's do it.

532
00:38:41,714 --> 00:38:44,165
What, back to the present?
- Oh, it's not that bad.

533
00:38:44,775 --> 00:38:46,026
Don't you think so?

534
00:38:48,875 --> 00:38:51,550
There's an article in one of these
magazines I've been meaning to show you.

535
00:38:51,875 --> 00:38:53,350
Christine.
- Hmm?

536
00:38:54,973 --> 00:38:56,618
We'll never get away from here you know.

537
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,135
Either of us.

538
00:38:59,772 --> 00:39:00,861
Why do you say that?

539
00:39:02,231 --> 00:39:03,347
Well, you won't go.

540
00:39:05,799 --> 00:39:07,873
Because there is nowhere else
for you to go, is there.

541
00:39:08,994 --> 00:39:10,838
Well .. maybe there isn't.

542
00:39:11,854 --> 00:39:14,179
That's why Stephen chose you, you know.

543
00:39:14,748 --> 00:39:16,207
And I can't go home, either.

544
00:39:16,577 --> 00:39:18,222
Not after the terrible thing that I did.

545
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:20,499
What did you do?

546
00:39:22,842 --> 00:39:24,314
I married Stephen.

547
00:39:27,288 --> 00:39:29,063
And why was that so terrible?

548
00:39:30,867 --> 00:39:32,741
My father didn't forgive me.

549
00:39:35,128 --> 00:39:36,497
We were so close.

550
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,431
So terribly close, you know.

551
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:42,510
Especially after my mother went away.

552
00:39:44,511 --> 00:39:46,949
Captain James Ferris and daughter.

553
00:39:47,942 --> 00:39:50,406
They'd invite us everywhere.
Together. All over the country.

554
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:54,331
So naturally, he got angry when
I went away with Stephen.

555
00:39:56,451 --> 00:39:57,524
He won't forgive me.

556
00:39:59,121 --> 00:39:59,928
Liane.

557
00:40:01,224 --> 00:40:03,292
He told me your father is dead.

558
00:40:04,892 --> 00:40:08,117
I know. But that's what makes
it so much worse. Don't you see?

559
00:40:09,063 --> 00:40:09,919
One day.

560
00:40:20,713 --> 00:40:21,813
One day.

561
00:40:22,068 --> 00:40:24,347
I'm going to do what my
father wanted me to do.

562
00:40:24,541 --> 00:40:26,042
I'm going to get away from Stephen.

563
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:27,900
That's what the egg money is for.

564
00:40:28,782 --> 00:40:31,095
The money that aunt Heather
gets from her range hens.

565
00:40:31,764 --> 00:40:34,350
She sells eggs. And I know
where she keeps the money.

566
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,359
Stephen won't let me have any money
in case I might try to escape.

567
00:40:38,882 --> 00:40:42,737
I know. Because I know where Heather
keeps her little hoard of egg money.

568
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:45,357
And one day, when it's enough.

569
00:40:45,859 --> 00:40:46,934
I'm going!

570
00:40:48,182 --> 00:40:49,930
Here .. look.

571
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:52,366
He's taken it.

572
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,555
No Liane. No. Stop it.

573
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:59,257
It's no good, Christine.

574
00:41:00,907 --> 00:41:02,256
We'll never get away.

575
00:41:11,727 --> 00:41:12,636
Liane.

576
00:41:19,014 --> 00:41:19,795
Liane.

577
00:41:20,329 --> 00:41:21,147
Liane.

578
00:41:29,412 --> 00:41:30,745
Have you seen Liane?

579
00:41:30,948 --> 00:41:32,168
She's in the garden.

580
00:41:32,426 --> 00:41:35,525
Here is the afternoon's post. See if
there is one for me, will you dear.

581
00:41:40,017 --> 00:41:41,633
Here's a letter for Liane from Ireland.

582
00:41:42,074 --> 00:41:42,990
Let me see.

583
00:41:43,385 --> 00:41:45,145
I'll go and call her .. Liane!

584
00:41:46,165 --> 00:41:48,369
Yes? There's a letter
for you from Ireland.

585
00:41:49,138 --> 00:41:50,259
A letter for me?

586
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:52,427
Where is it?

587
00:42:02,673 --> 00:42:04,803
Where is my letter?
- What letter, dear?

588
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,708
Why, Christine said I'd
got a letter from Ireland.

589
00:42:08,963 --> 00:42:12,567
Oh, but Christine made a mistake. We
all make mistakes sometimes, don't we.

590
00:42:13,634 --> 00:42:15,023
Ah, now where is my bag?

591
00:42:15,545 --> 00:42:16,997
I must have left it in the car.

592
00:42:17,208 --> 00:42:21,000
Go and look for it for me will
you dear. I'm getting so forgetful.

593
00:42:22,472 --> 00:42:23,985
What did you do with her letter?

594
00:42:24,662 --> 00:42:26,084
She mustn't have it.
- Why not?

595
00:42:26,545 --> 00:42:27,879
I can't tell you.

596
00:42:28,836 --> 00:42:30,395
I ought never to have let you see it.

597
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,279
If Stephen knew ..

598
00:42:32,888 --> 00:42:34,146
He'd be so angry.

599
00:42:39,956 --> 00:42:41,001
I'm afraid.

600
00:42:44,003 --> 00:42:45,219
Don't tell him, will you.

601
00:42:45,831 --> 00:42:46,767
Please, dear.

602
00:42:47,503 --> 00:42:49,043
What is it you're afraid of?

603
00:42:50,635 --> 00:42:51,882
That's Liane.

604
00:42:54,953 --> 00:42:55,869
Liane!

605
00:42:56,613 --> 00:42:57,522
Liane!

606
00:43:01,302 --> 00:43:03,728
She wanted to go to the fair.
The one you can see over the water.

607
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:06,447
It is all my fault. Stephen will
never forgive me. I know he won't.

608
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:09,183
Is there another car?
- Well, there's a taxi in the village.

609
00:43:09,385 --> 00:43:12,116
But please dear, don't do
anything to attract attention.

610
00:43:12,314 --> 00:43:14,703
Don't let everybody know.
- Don't worry I'll bring her back safe.

611
00:44:52,401 --> 00:44:54,161
Hurrah!
- Sit down.

612
00:46:08,772 --> 00:46:09,845
Good evening, Madam.

613
00:46:11,589 --> 00:46:12,994
Could I see Mr Dane, please?

614
00:46:15,576 --> 00:46:16,402
Stephen.

615
00:46:18,288 --> 00:46:19,730
Stephen.
- Yes?

616
00:46:19,925 --> 00:46:22,548
There is a Police Inspector
here to see you.

617
00:46:22,864 --> 00:46:24,008
Alright. I'm coming.

618
00:46:26,902 --> 00:46:27,564
Yes?

619
00:46:27,664 --> 00:46:29,227
How do you do, sir.
- How do you do.

620
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:32,505
I hear there has been some anxiety
this evening about Mrs Dane.

621
00:46:33,759 --> 00:46:35,182
My wife? What do you mean?

622
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:38,542
Well, this lady reported someone at the
fairground on a ride acting dangerously.

623
00:46:39,075 --> 00:46:41,808
I think you were troubled unnecessarily.
She hasn't left the house.

624
00:46:42,141 --> 00:46:43,577
Are you quite sure, sir?
- Yes.

625
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:45,602
Miss Godden must have
seen somebody else.

626
00:46:45,764 --> 00:46:47,724
I wonder if I might have
word with your wife, sir?

627
00:46:49,966 --> 00:46:51,723
Of course .. Liane!

628
00:46:53,273 --> 00:46:56,296
She has been washing her hair.
- Ask her to come down will you, please.

629
00:46:57,065 --> 00:46:59,390
Liane .. Stephen wants you, dear.

630
00:46:59,793 --> 00:47:00,927
Just for a moment.

631
00:47:01,605 --> 00:47:03,391
But I saw her at the fairground.

632
00:47:03,584 --> 00:47:05,658
There was a crowd, Miss.
You've got to allow for that.

633
00:47:08,237 --> 00:47:09,028
Liane.

634
00:47:09,287 --> 00:47:11,590
It seems you have a double,
who's been down at the fairground.

635
00:47:11,747 --> 00:47:13,750
Acting dangerously, I think they said.

636
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,562
Have you been out this evening?

637
00:47:15,907 --> 00:47:17,867
Of course not, darling.
I've been washing my hair.

638
00:47:18,283 --> 00:47:19,532
Christine went out though.

639
00:47:20,182 --> 00:47:21,341
Did you enjoy yourself?

640
00:47:21,917 --> 00:47:23,333
We missed you so much at dinner.

641
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,655
Come along, dear. I'll help you.

642
00:47:27,665 --> 00:47:29,508
There. We seem to have
been wasting your time.

643
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:31,261
I'm sure Miss Godden meant to help.

644
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:33,135
It's alright, sir. We all make mistakes.

645
00:47:39,373 --> 00:47:42,319
You are supposed to look after Liane.
You're not required to call the Police.

646
00:47:42,478 --> 00:47:44,827
Do you understand that?
- But she left in aunt Heather's car.

647
00:47:44,985 --> 00:47:47,270
My car is in the garage
and Liane is upstairs.

648
00:47:49,054 --> 00:47:50,907
We'd get on better you know if you'd ..

649
00:47:51,007 --> 00:47:54,027
Stop trying to find the answers to
questions that you don't understand.

650
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,478
[ Aunt Heather: ]

651
00:47:57,045 --> 00:47:57,771
Liane.

652
00:47:58,403 --> 00:48:00,511
Make sure your hair is quite dry, dear.

653
00:48:48,321 --> 00:48:49,761
Good evening, Miss Godden.

654
00:48:52,714 --> 00:48:54,676
I appreciate you coming
to see me like this.

655
00:48:55,855 --> 00:48:57,332
I appreciate it very much.

656
00:48:58,395 --> 00:48:59,794
I want to ask you something.

657
00:49:00,201 --> 00:49:01,664
Don't be shy, Miss Godden.

658
00:49:02,083 --> 00:49:03,819
You'll find me very easy to get on with.

659
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:07,130
It's about Mrs Dane.

660
00:49:08,593 --> 00:49:10,496
Well, that's not a fit
subject for conversation.

661
00:49:11,116 --> 00:49:13,039
Not when we're alone together in here.

662
00:49:13,713 --> 00:49:15,644
You were with her today
at the fair, weren't you?

663
00:49:15,842 --> 00:49:17,755
She's an embarrassment.
That's what she is.

664
00:49:18,287 --> 00:49:20,421
Has he asked you to
say it never happened?

665
00:49:20,848 --> 00:49:22,005
I avoid her company.

666
00:49:22,388 --> 00:49:23,304
Honest, I do.

667
00:49:24,781 --> 00:49:27,645
Half the time she's round your
neck begging and pleading.

668
00:49:30,115 --> 00:49:32,293
And the other half,
she is screaming at you.

669
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:34,589
Yelling at you.

670
00:49:34,906 --> 00:49:36,251
Using words I never heard.

671
00:49:36,571 --> 00:49:37,613
Only in the army.

672
00:49:37,713 --> 00:49:39,915
She's made you lie to
me as well. Is that it?

673
00:49:43,691 --> 00:49:46,324
I wonder what you could be
talking about, Miss Godden.

674
00:49:46,553 --> 00:49:48,167
I saw you with her at the fair.

675
00:49:51,471 --> 00:49:52,747
Of course it's ..

676
00:49:53,442 --> 00:49:54,876
It's lonely here for a man.

677
00:49:56,294 --> 00:49:57,776
I was chauffeuring before.

678
00:49:59,093 --> 00:50:01,941
The old girl I worked for.
She looked after me alright.

679
00:50:03,316 --> 00:50:04,187
Did ..

680
00:50:05,383 --> 00:50:07,551
Did Mr Dane say she didn't
go out this evening?

681
00:50:07,872 --> 00:50:08,716
Yes, he did.

682
00:50:09,579 --> 00:50:10,509
Well, that's ..

683
00:50:11,656 --> 00:50:13,358
That's not the first
time he's done that.

684
00:50:15,166 --> 00:50:17,668
It must be very confusing
for that poor girl.

685
00:50:18,924 --> 00:50:20,717
I wonder if that's what
he's trying to do?

686
00:50:21,527 --> 00:50:22,808
What is he trying to do?

687
00:50:23,595 --> 00:50:25,864
You know what her real
trouble is, don't you?

688
00:50:27,534 --> 00:50:30,714
She's kept very short of
the affection she needs.

689
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:35,043
How about you, Miss Godden?

690
00:50:35,556 --> 00:50:37,773
Is that why you came down
here for your evening walk?

691
00:50:40,316 --> 00:50:41,615
What's the matter with you?

692
00:50:41,862 --> 00:50:43,883
Saving yourself for Mr Dane? Ha!

693
00:50:44,138 --> 00:50:45,417
He's no good to you.

694
00:50:45,927 --> 00:50:47,337
He's no good to you at all.

695
00:51:08,622 --> 00:51:10,670
Mr Dane.
- What is it?

696
00:51:11,726 --> 00:51:15,106
These plants have the most poisonous
diet. One has to be very careful.

697
00:51:16,529 --> 00:51:17,997
Do you like this one?

698
00:51:18,543 --> 00:51:20,625
It's called 'Liane'.
- Mr Dane.

699
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:25,203
After what's happened tonight, I think
it's best I leave here in the morning.

700
00:51:26,989 --> 00:51:27,992
I see.

701
00:51:29,425 --> 00:51:32,677
I'm afraid I was very rude. I apologize
if that's what you want to hear.

702
00:51:32,857 --> 00:51:34,968
That isn't necessary.
- Well, what else can I say?

703
00:51:35,636 --> 00:51:37,281
I don't want you to go. I need you here.

704
00:51:37,713 --> 00:51:38,896
You don't need me.

705
00:51:39,112 --> 00:51:41,442
You have your own ideas on
how to take care of your wife.

706
00:51:41,679 --> 00:51:43,467
I'm only doing what
I think is best for her.

707
00:51:43,773 --> 00:51:46,428
You lied to me and
you lied to the Police.

708
00:51:47,802 --> 00:51:49,432
Well .. I had to.

709
00:51:50,151 --> 00:51:51,910
Every time I see Police, I see ..

710
00:51:52,175 --> 00:51:56,441
Doctors and ambulances and magistrates
signing certificates to put her away.

711
00:51:57,285 --> 00:51:58,567
That's why I engaged you.

712
00:51:58,667 --> 00:52:01,370
Because although you are a doctor, you
have no authority to lock anybody up.

713
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:04,186
You know Liane.

714
00:52:04,665 --> 00:52:06,367
You know what it's
like to be a prisoner.

715
00:52:06,715 --> 00:52:07,979
I'll never forget.

716
00:52:08,711 --> 00:52:10,215
I was upholding the law.

717
00:52:11,984 --> 00:52:13,761
It doesn't mean I didn't understand.

718
00:52:14,614 --> 00:52:15,705
What you had to do.

719
00:52:16,535 --> 00:52:18,239
I was a prisoner too, you know.

720
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:21,315
Captured in the early part of the war.

721
00:52:23,966 --> 00:52:27,018
When I came out, I'd learnt
law by correspondence.

722
00:52:27,582 --> 00:52:30,218
And how to make cigarettes
out of old army regulations.

723
00:52:31,863 --> 00:52:35,313
But I had .. forgotten
how to take girls out.

724
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:37,606
How to go dancing.

725
00:52:37,991 --> 00:52:39,465
Or even get drunk efficiently.

726
00:52:40,437 --> 00:52:42,373
I didn't catch up much
on those sort of things.

727
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:45,294
When I met Liane.

728
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:48,365
She appeared to me to be all
of the things that I'd missed.

729
00:52:48,786 --> 00:52:50,493
When I was behind barbed wire.

730
00:52:54,007 --> 00:52:55,709
Now do you understand
me a little better?

731
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,443
It may seem a strange thing,
my bringing you here.

732
00:53:01,546 --> 00:53:02,879
But it's beginning to work.

733
00:53:03,166 --> 00:53:03,877
Is it?

734
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:06,694
Your wife is sick and
unhappy. She hates it here.

735
00:53:06,914 --> 00:53:08,015
She wants to go home.

736
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:10,648
Home to beautiful Curragh.

737
00:53:11,251 --> 00:53:14,306
Shall I tell you the truth.
Curragh is a broken-down ruin.

738
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:16,604
And that father she's
always talking about.

739
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:20,849
The gallant Captain James Ferris
was a drunken horse trader.

740
00:53:22,028 --> 00:53:23,369
You hate him, don't you?

741
00:53:24,103 --> 00:53:25,640
He's dead. Why should I hate him?

742
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:26,990
Because he made her happy.

743
00:53:27,262 --> 00:53:27,948
Happy?

744
00:53:28,349 --> 00:53:31,586
Yes. She was free then. She wasn't
shut in here with all your lies.

745
00:53:33,245 --> 00:53:35,069
Alright. I can't deal with Liane.

746
00:53:35,494 --> 00:53:36,363
You tell me.

747
00:53:37,173 --> 00:53:38,416
You can deal with her.

748
00:53:39,017 --> 00:53:41,283
Can't you let her out a little
without us watching?

749
00:53:44,523 --> 00:53:45,619
We'll let her out.

750
00:53:46,428 --> 00:53:47,580
But we'll watch her.

751
00:53:48,495 --> 00:53:49,389
Both of us.

752
00:53:52,278 --> 00:53:53,801
You're really clever, Christine.

753
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:57,452
Then, you are clever at so many things.

754
00:53:58,410 --> 00:53:59,932
Such a nice friend for Stephen.

755
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:02,096
Turn around a bit.

756
00:54:03,529 --> 00:54:05,489
Do you remember that girl
I was telling you about?

757
00:54:06,002 --> 00:54:08,772
The one who runs the pub?
Polly is her name.

758
00:54:09,252 --> 00:54:10,141
Yes.

759
00:54:13,638 --> 00:54:15,801
Stephen is crazy about her, you know.

760
00:54:16,971 --> 00:54:18,865
He is?
- Sure.

761
00:54:22,786 --> 00:54:24,038
He's mine, Christine.

762
00:54:27,318 --> 00:54:29,068
No-one else is going to have him.

763
00:54:34,286 --> 00:54:35,594
Do you understand that?

764
00:54:36,759 --> 00:54:38,479
Lend me the scissors, will you?

765
00:54:45,311 --> 00:54:46,658
Do you want the scissors?

766
00:54:52,428 --> 00:54:55,215
This dress is going to look
great at the races, you know.

767
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:56,769
I hope so.

768
00:55:23,004 --> 00:55:25,154
I'll collect your winnings.
I'll see you at the desk.

769
00:55:25,254 --> 00:55:28,434
I've never been lucky before.
- You're really good at choosing.

770
00:55:29,873 --> 00:55:31,678
You know when my father
used to win a race.

771
00:55:31,936 --> 00:55:34,269
He'd go and treat all
his friends for a drink.

772
00:55:34,777 --> 00:55:36,755
And sometimes treat some strangers, too.

773
00:55:45,152 --> 00:55:47,681
Where is Stephen?
- Well, he went to get your winnings.

774
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:51,477
He should be here.
- Well, he'll be here in a minute.

775
00:55:52,059 --> 00:55:53,963
He's staying away on purpose.
- No, he's not.

776
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:55,817
There's Polly.

777
00:55:56,625 --> 00:55:58,137
The girl I was telling you about.

778
00:56:01,895 --> 00:56:03,356
A gin and tonic, please.

779
00:56:05,623 --> 00:56:07,178
A gin and tonic, please!

780
00:56:08,128 --> 00:56:09,575
I've had no luck at all today.

781
00:56:09,675 --> 00:56:11,459
I think number 6. He's a bit overweight.

782
00:56:11,559 --> 00:56:13,196
Hello, Dickie.
- Hello, Dane.

783
00:56:13,521 --> 00:56:15,427
Have you found a winner?
- No. This is Liane's.

784
00:56:15,667 --> 00:56:17,349
Is Liane here?
- Yes, somewhere.

785
00:56:17,505 --> 00:56:19,286
I must get her give
me a tip for the 3:30.

786
00:56:19,546 --> 00:56:20,647
I've got a hot tip ..

787
00:56:20,875 --> 00:56:22,133
I want a gin and tonic!!

788
00:56:22,476 --> 00:56:25,751
You know Polly's child looks just
like Stephen. Very suspicious, isn't it?

789
00:56:25,937 --> 00:56:28,181
What are you talking about?
He's the image of my husband.

790
00:56:28,858 --> 00:56:30,862
Look Mrs Dane. I've known
Stephen since the army.

791
00:56:31,256 --> 00:56:32,892
Here's your money.
- Look at Stephen.

792
00:56:33,095 --> 00:56:35,648
He's frightened that we might
find out too much about her.

793
00:56:37,323 --> 00:56:38,701
Goodbye, Polly dear.

794
00:56:39,612 --> 00:56:41,858
You haven't been seeing so much
of Stephen lately, have you?

795
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:44,248
He's got a new interest in life.

796
00:56:44,997 --> 00:56:46,365
My beautiful companion.

797
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:50,526
They hold hands, on the beach you know.

798
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:54,559
I don't blame you, Christine.

799
00:56:55,547 --> 00:56:56,677
It's his fault.

800
00:56:57,597 --> 00:56:59,080
He's irresistible, isn't he.

801
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:00,993
Until you get to know him.

802
00:57:01,943 --> 00:57:03,788
And then when you
look deep into his eyes.

803
00:57:04,415 --> 00:57:07,303
You see that there is nothing there
at all. Have you ever noticed that?

804
00:57:07,467 --> 00:57:08,969
You are afraid, aren't you Stephen?

805
00:57:10,133 --> 00:57:13,416
You're afraid of what all these
pompous idiots all think of you.

806
00:57:13,811 --> 00:57:14,735
Hmm?

807
00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:19,163
Mr Stephen Dane, QC.

808
00:57:20,284 --> 00:57:22,895
Standing up in court, in his black gown.

809
00:57:24,026 --> 00:57:25,780
Wearing a severe expression.

810
00:57:27,017 --> 00:57:28,576
And making all the criminals tremble.

811
00:57:28,970 --> 00:57:32,028
And nobody knows the truth
about him. Nobody knows!

812
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:34,657
Take her home, please.
Here are the keys to the car.

813
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:36,880
Don't ever give her the keys to the car!

814
00:57:42,166 --> 00:57:44,108
Do you think I want to
stay here with you?

815
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:46,539
You're nothing to me.

816
00:57:47,013 --> 00:57:47,928
Who are you?

817
00:57:49,502 --> 00:57:51,698
You're not my husband.
You don't even sleep with me.

818
00:57:55,041 --> 00:57:56,422
Come on, Liane.

819
00:57:58,147 --> 00:58:00,188
Alright, Christine. I'm tired now.

820
00:58:01,516 --> 00:58:03,522
You know, it's not
exciting any more, is it.

821
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:21,210
[ Door knocks ]

822
00:58:21,833 --> 00:58:22,629
Yes?

823
00:58:24,123 --> 00:58:26,286
I saw your light on.
Is everything alright?

824
00:58:27,810 --> 00:58:29,139
She got much calmer.

825
00:58:29,462 --> 00:58:32,931
Good .. I had to stay and
straighten out the social situation.

826
00:58:34,072 --> 00:58:35,363
Did you?
- Yes.

827
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:39,298
I bought Bill and Polly drinks
and Ebblington some dinner.

828
00:58:39,822 --> 00:58:43,025
We sat surrounded by horse-faced
girls who talked about ..

829
00:58:43,289 --> 00:58:45,065
The weather, and racing and ..

830
00:58:45,787 --> 00:58:46,614
Horses.

831
00:58:47,775 --> 00:58:49,188
We never mentioned Liane.

832
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:51,135
I see.

833
00:58:51,567 --> 00:58:54,521
One thing about the English. They'll
always pretend that nothing happened.

834
00:58:55,437 --> 00:58:57,848
So I've noticed.
- You didn't believe her, did you?

835
00:58:59,211 --> 00:59:01,129
I've known Polly since she was a child.

836
00:59:02,132 --> 00:59:05,015
Bert and I were in prison camp together.
I never quarrelled with him.

837
00:59:05,747 --> 00:59:06,712
Then or since.

838
00:59:07,287 --> 00:59:08,724
Liane worries me more and more.

839
00:59:08,976 --> 00:59:11,300
She .. she suddenly
seemed jealous of me.

840
00:59:12,899 --> 00:59:14,352
That's ridiculous, isn't it.

841
00:59:14,871 --> 00:59:16,256
Yes, very ridiculous.

842
00:59:16,851 --> 00:59:18,246
If she knew the truth.

843
00:59:19,605 --> 00:59:20,649
You know.

844
00:59:22,096 --> 00:59:23,370
It's like in the war.

845
00:59:23,470 --> 00:59:26,574
When one was crossing a minefield
in the dark and one was treading ..

846
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:30,516
Delicately and waiting for an explosion.
That's what it's like living with Liane.

847
00:59:32,173 --> 00:59:33,303
I know what it's like.

848
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:34,826
Do you?

849
00:59:36,389 --> 00:59:37,870
The things you can't say.

850
00:59:38,411 --> 00:59:39,484
The subjects that ..

851
00:59:40,497 --> 00:59:43,990
You've got to avoid.
The plans you can't make.

852
00:59:46,032 --> 00:59:47,378
I remember all that.

853
00:59:48,671 --> 00:59:49,647
Look, we are ..

854
00:59:50,272 --> 00:59:53,204
So separated now. It's like
living in another country.

855
00:59:53,567 --> 00:59:55,217
And that's when they need you the most.

856
00:59:55,769 --> 00:59:56,652
Does Liane?

857
00:59:57,203 --> 00:59:58,247
Of course she does.

858
00:59:58,575 --> 01:00:00,597
What do you think she was
shouting about today?

859
01:00:00,845 --> 01:00:03,293
It's when they are so ill that
they need someone to hate.

860
01:00:04,478 --> 01:00:06,266
And that's when you
can't ever leave them.

861
01:00:07,055 --> 01:00:08,159
Not possibly.

862
01:00:10,266 --> 01:00:12,378
Thank goodness you
were there this afternoon.

863
01:00:15,735 --> 01:00:17,087
What are you thinking about?

864
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:20,773
All the things we've missed.

865
01:00:23,508 --> 01:00:24,953
I brought you here to help Liane.

866
01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:27,193
I think you can help me.

867
01:00:27,967 --> 01:00:29,913
There is something important
I ought to tell you.

868
01:00:30,961 --> 01:00:33,305
So that you can deal with
Liane when the time comes.

870
01:00:41,335 --> 01:00:42,694
I'll tell you some other time.

871
01:00:43,209 --> 01:00:43,853
Soon.

872
01:00:46,826 --> 01:00:48,813
Sometimes, I wish it could
be over and finished.

873
01:00:49,978 --> 01:00:51,368
And I knew nothing about it.

874
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,789
Hurry up now, aunt Heather.
- Oh dear.

875
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:04,253
What is it this time?

876
01:01:04,353 --> 01:01:06,421
I must have left my
shopping list in the hall.

877
01:01:06,645 --> 01:01:08,854
But you don't need it.
You know what we've got to do.

878
01:01:09,225 --> 01:01:10,746
First, you take me to the dentist.

879
01:01:10,993 --> 01:01:12,374
Then we go and get my records.

880
01:01:12,474 --> 01:01:14,133
Here's your list.
- Then we have tea.

881
01:01:14,233 --> 01:01:15,216
Thank you, dear.

882
01:01:15,489 --> 01:01:17,775
She's very nervy.
- She'll be alright.

883
01:01:21,147 --> 01:01:23,610
Have a good time.
- What? At the dentists?

[ Whistling ]

885

[ Whistling ]

886
01:01:54,426 --> 01:01:55,680
Yes. What is it?

887
01:01:56,173 --> 01:01:58,946
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to have startled you.

888
01:02:00,101 --> 01:02:01,660
I took the liberty of dropping in.

889
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,811
I understand Mr Dane wouldn't be in
his office today, so I thought I'd ..

890
01:02:05,154 --> 01:02:06,831
Take him by surprise .. at home.

891
01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:08,779
I'm sorry. He's not at home.

892
01:02:09,137 --> 01:02:10,946
May I take a message?
- I see.

893
01:02:11,282 --> 01:02:13,327
Well, if you wouldn't mind
telling him that I called.

894
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:17,712
'Ferris' is the name.
Captain James Ferris.

895
01:02:19,409 --> 01:02:20,475
Wait a minute.

896
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:25,562
Are you .. Liane's father?

897
01:02:26,072 --> 01:02:27,801
Yes. That's right.
- I was told ..

898
01:02:27,972 --> 01:02:31,376
Oh, that I was dead? Yes, I know. That
was on Mr Dane's insistence, of course.

899
01:02:33,497 --> 01:02:36,136
I am .. not supposed to see my child.

900
01:02:37,082 --> 01:02:37,856
Come in.

901
01:02:42,470 --> 01:02:43,851
Captain Ferris, there is ..

902
01:02:45,642 --> 01:02:47,493
There is something I
don't quite understand.

903
01:02:48,483 --> 01:02:50,301
Why aren't you supposed
to see your daughter?

904
01:02:52,332 --> 01:02:54,404
It's a very logical
query if I may say so.

905
01:02:55,275 --> 01:02:59,358
But one perhaps more properly
directed at Mr Dane himself.

906
01:03:00,220 --> 01:03:02,103
I was told you were
killed in a car crash.

907
01:03:03,370 --> 01:03:04,942
Yes. Well, there was an accident.

908
01:03:05,825 --> 01:03:07,106
You know what lawyers are.

909
01:03:08,033 --> 01:03:10,515
They'll always formulate their own
version of the facts, won't they.

910
01:03:11,930 --> 01:03:13,661
In any case, I can't
complain because I ..

911
01:03:13,955 --> 01:03:16,328
I agreed. I agreed to my own death. Yes.

912
01:03:17,913 --> 01:03:18,649
Why?

913
01:03:23,323 --> 01:03:27,423
It seems .. that Liane got it into her
poor little head that I'd been killed.

914
01:03:27,713 --> 01:03:30,555
So .. out of consideration
for her, I suppose.

915
01:03:31,548 --> 01:03:33,422
He thought it would be
better if I stayed away.

916
01:03:33,845 --> 01:03:36,353
The shock of seeing me
might only harm her.

917
01:03:37,142 --> 01:03:39,605
And you believed him?
- He was very convincing.

918
01:03:40,889 --> 01:03:41,883
He always is.

919
01:03:42,129 --> 01:03:44,403
But I gave my word and .. I've kept it.

920
01:03:44,724 --> 01:03:46,580
Well then .. why are you here today?

921
01:03:47,144 --> 01:03:49,990
Well, I made sure Liane
wasn't here when I came in.

922
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:51,707
You see, I've no choice.

923
01:03:52,306 --> 01:03:53,504
Besides, I'm worried.

924
01:03:54,487 --> 01:03:57,079
And I'm worried about her state
of mind. You know, a little afraid.

925
01:03:58,145 --> 01:03:59,469
Of course, we Irish. We ..

926
01:04:00,578 --> 01:04:02,709
We're supposed to live in a
world of fantasy, aren't we.

927
01:04:02,863 --> 01:04:05,377
Are you sure you're not afraid of him?
- Of who?

928
01:04:06,769 --> 01:04:08,021
Why should I be?

929
01:04:08,783 --> 01:04:09,684
Of course not.

930
01:04:10,225 --> 01:04:12,072
Well, I mustn't trouble you any longer.

931
01:04:13,034 --> 01:04:15,512
I'm only here to sell a
mare I have at Curragh.

932
01:04:16,172 --> 01:04:18,876
And get a little scrap of information
about my daughter from Mr Dane.

933
01:04:19,172 --> 01:04:20,502
He'll be back in the morning.

934
01:04:21,557 --> 01:04:22,788
It's a pity I can't stay.

01:04:23,334 --> 01:04:25,589
There it is. My plane goes in an hour.

936
01:04:26,764 --> 01:04:28,892
I would love to have got
another glimpse of Liane.

937
01:04:30,134 --> 01:04:31,873
She's very beautiful now. Isn't she?

938
01:04:32,685 --> 01:04:34,291
Yes, very beautiful.
- Uhuh.

939
01:04:35,657 --> 01:04:37,760
But you know, her mother,
she was a miracle at her age.

940
01:04:37,937 --> 01:04:39,098
An absolute miracle.

941
01:04:40,893 --> 01:04:43,485
That is all we can produce
in Ireland: horses and poetry.

942
01:04:43,851 --> 01:04:44,859
Beautiful women.

943
01:04:44,959 --> 01:04:47,410
Liane should see you. She should ..
- No. I don't think she should.

944
01:04:47,626 --> 01:04:48,863
Not really. Not yet.

945
01:04:50,218 --> 01:04:51,916
I was just wondering.

946
01:04:53,568 --> 01:04:55,115
I was wondering why he has you here.

947
01:04:55,664 --> 01:04:58,444
He's a very ingenious man you know.
He never does things without a reason.

948
01:04:59,926 --> 01:05:01,505
I suppose I'd better say goodbye.

949
01:05:02,201 --> 01:05:05,428
I'll be glad to get back. It's wonderful
at Curragh now with the flowers out.

950
01:05:06,066 --> 01:05:06,930
The gardens.

951
01:05:07,368 --> 01:05:08,447
As I always say.

952
01:05:08,714 --> 01:05:11,446
They ought not to be our gardens. They
ought to be turned over to the public.

953
01:05:11,863 --> 01:05:12,599
Well.

954
01:05:13,421 --> 01:05:14,176
Goodbye.

955
01:05:17,879 --> 01:05:19,843
You must hurry if you
want to catch that plane.

956
01:05:19,943 --> 01:05:22,431
Yes. Well, I'll see you in Dublin.
I'll see you at the horse show.

957
01:05:22,907 --> 01:05:25,289
If there is any news, tell me then.
- You can be sure of that.

958
01:05:33,058 --> 01:05:35,004
You've .. had a visitor.

959
01:05:35,591 --> 01:05:36,656
Do you know him?

960
01:05:36,858 --> 01:05:38,789
I used to buy horses from him years ago.

961
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:40,793
A very honest trader.

962
01:05:41,564 --> 01:05:44,075
It's a terrible thing isn't it,
to do to that poor man.

963
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:46,162
Kill him off like that.

964
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:50,248
I told you Mr Dane makes ..

965
01:05:51,049 --> 01:05:53,264
He makes life very confusing
for his poor wife.

966
01:05:55,058 --> 01:05:56,569
But then, perhaps it's intentional?

967
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:59,520
Perhaps he wants her locked up.

968
01:06:00,172 --> 01:06:01,833
Why should he want that?

969
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:04,048
Who knows?

970
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,485
Maybe he's looking for a new wife?

971
01:06:06,910 --> 01:06:09,278
Someone .. nice and sensible.

972
01:06:10,826 --> 01:06:12,407
Yourself, for instance.

973
01:06:35,214 --> 01:06:37,700
Liane .. let's get out of this shop.
I want to talk to you.

974
01:06:38,114 --> 01:06:41,874
Let's go into the booth and listen to
this record. And you can tell me there.

975
01:06:43,226 --> 01:06:46,155

you call me up at the dances?

go back to Curragh?

978
01:06:50,030 --> 01:06:50,871
Curragh?

979
01:06:52,403 --> 01:06:53,500
I liked it there.

980
01:06:55,069 --> 01:06:57,116
My father ..
- I saw our father today.

981
01:06:58,708 --> 01:06:59,695
What did you say?

982
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:02,251
I said, I saw your father today.

983
01:07:05,231 --> 01:07:08,302
It's not funny, Christine. You shouldn't
make jokes about him, poor man.

984
01:07:08,402 --> 01:07:11,863
Your father isn't dead, Liane.
He came to the house this afternoon.

985
01:07:12,149 --> 01:07:13,622
I'll not listen to you, Christine.

986
01:07:13,812 --> 01:07:15,712
You're only saying it to make me mad.

987
01:07:15,870 --> 01:07:18,907
You must listen to me. I'm telling you
the first truth you've heard in years.

988
01:07:19,299 --> 01:07:22,369
Look, your father loves you and I will
take you back to Ireland to see him.

989
01:07:22,993 --> 01:07:24,781
When you get there,
you'll feel much better.

990
01:07:25,043 --> 01:07:26,702
And no-one will lie to you again.

991
01:07:29,968 --> 01:07:31,160
Except you, perhaps?

992
01:07:32,031 --> 01:07:33,414
Why would I like to you?

993

01:07:42,167 --> 01:07:43,670
Oh, I'd like to go back there.

995
01:07:45,444 --> 01:07:47,081
Alright, Christine. I'll go with you.

996
01:07:47,938 --> 01:07:50,882
Stephen is going to be so angry.
Can we go now before anyone finds out?

997
01:08:29,786 --> 01:08:33,033
Take us to the Dublin ferry please.
We just have half an hour to catch it.

998
01:08:33,376 --> 01:08:35,301
Do you think she saw us?
- No, I don't think so.

999
01:08:37,227 --> 01:08:39,084
Oh good, you brought my bag.

1000
01:08:42,172 --> 01:08:45,228
If Stephen finds out, he'll try to ..
- Liane. Don't worry about a thing.

1001
01:08:47,627 --> 01:08:49,584
Tomorrow morning we'll
be safe in Ireland.

1002

Look .. cattle.

1003
01:09:42,797 --> 01:09:45,262
We're here, Christine. We're at Curragh.

1004
01:09:48,518 --> 01:09:49,329
I'm back.

1005
01:09:51,076 --> 01:09:53,058
Liane Ferris is back in town.

1006

Liane.
- Mrs O'Flynn.

1007
01:09:55,413 --> 01:09:57,002
Mrs Bowler.
- Liane.

1008
01:09:57,489 --> 01:09:59,620
Don't you see Christine?
This is where I told you about.

1009
01:09:59,864 --> 01:10:01,378
Isn't it a wonderful place?

1010
01:10:04,704 --> 01:10:05,981
Go on, there.

1011
01:10:18,341 --> 01:10:19,671
We're nearly home, Christine.

1012
01:10:20,287 --> 01:10:21,743
Straight ahead, now.

1013
01:10:26,088 --> 01:10:28,026
I remember every stone of it, Christine.

1014
01:10:29,539 --> 01:10:32,697
Sometimes, after the parties
in the village on the races.

1015
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:34,958
My father used to take
me on his shoulders.

1016
01:10:35,504 --> 01:10:36,941
We'd walk up this hill.

1017
01:10:37,334 --> 01:10:39,307
And start singing all the old songs.

1018
01:10:40,492 --> 01:10:42,290
Where he's put me down sometimes.

1019
01:10:43,035 --> 01:10:44,521
And go to sleep on the grass.

1020
01:10:45,464 --> 01:10:48,538
I would pick blackberries or
flowers to decorate the house.

1021
01:10:58,748 --> 01:11:00,192
That's where my mother died.

1022
01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:03,084
They found her down there
at the bottom of that cliff.

1023
01:11:26,605 --> 01:11:28,092
It's not passable.

1024
01:11:29,857 --> 01:11:31,937
No, Liane no. We've got to go back.

1025
01:11:32,315 --> 01:11:33,785
We can't drive though here.

1026
01:11:34,823 --> 01:11:36,010
Then we'll have to walk.

1027
01:11:36,450 --> 01:11:37,565
I know a shortcut.

1028
01:11:38,650 --> 01:11:40,171
Please, Christine.

1029
01:11:49,712 --> 01:11:50,876
We're almost there.

1030
01:11:59,741 --> 01:12:00,927
That's it, Christine.

1031
01:12:01,866 --> 01:12:03,120
That's the house.

1032
01:13:03,786 --> 01:13:04,894
I've lost my way.

1033
01:13:05,298 --> 01:13:06,707
This is someone else's house.

1034
01:13:07,796 --> 01:13:09,245
This is not my home, Christine.

1035
01:13:09,582 --> 01:13:11,922
No. No, this is not your home, Liane.

1036
01:13:12,133 --> 01:13:14,105
We'd better go.
- I've been thinking.

1037
01:13:15,459 --> 01:13:17,394
There's a path round
the corner of the house.

1038
01:13:18,063 --> 01:13:19,760
That must be where Curragh is.

1039
01:13:20,957 --> 01:13:22,522
We will find it, won't we, Christine?

1040
01:13:22,778 --> 01:13:24,766
Yes, of course we will.
We'll look for it tomorrow.

1041
01:13:24,942 --> 01:13:26,059
It's so stupid of me.

1042
01:13:27,757 --> 01:13:28,752
What do you want?

1043
01:13:29,051 --> 01:13:30,481
We just came to the wrong house.

1044
01:13:30,581 --> 01:13:32,811
There are two ladies
here to see you .. Captain.

1045
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:17,268
Liane .. Liane, don't.

1046
01:14:18,390 --> 01:14:19,090
Don't.

1047
01:14:20,405 --> 01:14:21,590
Please stop this.

1048
01:14:25,036 --> 01:14:26,237
So you see, Liane.

1049
01:14:27,441 --> 01:14:28,513
I'm alive alright.

1050
01:14:28,945 --> 01:14:29,886
Be quiet!

1051
01:14:30,097 --> 01:14:32,246
Oh yes, I'm very much alive.

1052
01:14:33,628 --> 01:14:34,709
I'm afraid, Liane.

1053
01:14:35,434 --> 01:14:38,051
It was your husband's idea.
- You've done enough!

1054
01:14:40,956 --> 01:14:41,663
Liane.

1055
01:15:07,804 --> 01:15:09,591
Is it really you, my father?

1056
01:15:11,366 --> 01:15:12,191
That's me.

1057
01:15:46,401 --> 01:15:48,043
I've come back. Do you see?

1058
01:15:49,086 --> 01:15:51,202
I've come back to live
at Curragh with you.

1059
01:15:52,790 --> 01:15:55,842
You are so silly. You've let this
beautiful house get rather dusty.

1060
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:01,527
You always did need a woman
around the house, didn't you.

1061
01:16:02,415 --> 01:16:04,920
Someone to .. to change the flowers.

1062
01:16:06,747 --> 01:16:08,314
And take back the empties.

1063
01:16:10,315 --> 01:16:12,303
Why did you change the carpet?

1064
01:16:15,301 --> 01:16:17,464
Where's that one that looked
like the bottom of the sea?

1065
01:16:19,153 --> 01:16:20,499
You know, the one when you ..

1066
01:16:21,273 --> 01:16:22,733
When you lay down on it.

1067
01:16:23,736 --> 01:16:24,880
And looked.

1068
01:16:31,408 --> 01:16:33,974
Oh, I'm glad you kept
the beautiful lights.

1069
01:16:36,872 --> 01:16:40,342
Tomorrow I'll take it down and
I'll wash all that wonderful glass.

1070
01:16:41,673 --> 01:16:44,171
Come on, dear.
We'll take you home.

1071
01:16:47,776 --> 01:16:49,530
You don't want to make me go, do you?

1072
01:16:50,471 --> 01:16:53,577
You don't want them to take me away?
- You will have to go, Liane.

1073
01:16:56,310 --> 01:16:57,887
But I only just found you.

1074
01:16:59,369 --> 01:17:00,720
No, it's no use, dear.

1075
01:17:02,154 --> 01:17:03,864
You can see the way things are, here.

1076
01:17:09,226 --> 01:17:10,555
He's your husband.

1077
01:17:11,742 --> 01:17:13,493
It's his responsibility, not mine.

1078
01:17:18,392 --> 01:17:19,332
Come on.

1079
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:23,415
No .. no!

1080
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:32,399
Liane!

1081
01:17:38,503 --> 01:17:39,972
Liane, come back!

1082
01:17:57,648 --> 01:17:58,963
How is she, doctor?

1083
01:17:59,359 --> 01:18:00,975
Well, the fall didn't hurt her so much.

1084
01:18:01,374 --> 01:18:03,162
It's the mental disturbance
that worries me.

1085
01:18:04,285 --> 01:18:06,188
You'd better give her two
of these, Miss Godden.

1086
01:18:06,574 --> 01:18:07,818
In case she gets restless.

1087
01:18:09,243 --> 01:18:10,980
And you get some rest yourself.

1088
01:18:12,387 --> 01:18:14,347
I'll be along in the morning.
- Thank you, doctor.

1089
01:18:14,561 --> 01:18:15,564
I uh ..

1090
01:18:16,978 --> 01:18:19,328
I'm afraid I'll have to call
in one of my colleagues.

1091
01:18:19,610 --> 01:18:22,451
I'll telephone you tomorrow as
soon as I get in touch with him.

1092
01:18:36,877 --> 01:18:38,493
He thinks she may have to be committed.

1093
01:18:40,077 --> 01:18:41,665
Well, that's the end of that struggle.

1094
01:18:42,490 --> 01:18:43,519
It's a struggle.

1095
01:18:43,858 --> 01:18:45,138
I doubt you could have won.

1096
01:18:45,238 --> 01:18:47,313
But I was trying. I tried
to keep the truth from her.

1097
01:18:47,497 --> 01:18:49,456
I didn't want to drag it
out in front of her eyes.

1098
01:18:51,847 --> 01:18:52,935
How did you find us?

1099
01:18:53,225 --> 01:18:56,228
I heard about Ferris's visit and
I guessed you were here.

1100
01:19:00,078 --> 01:19:02,410
Christine, I should have told you
the truth from the beginning.

1101
01:19:03,565 --> 01:19:04,293
Yes.

1102
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:08,786
Did Captain Ferris's charm work on you?

1103
01:19:09,859 --> 01:19:11,561
When he came to the
house I believed him.

1104
01:19:12,745 --> 01:19:14,927
He said he missed Liane.
- Missed Liane?

1105
01:19:15,490 --> 01:19:19,222
I told you. I met him during the course
of a criminal investigation in Belfast.

1106
01:19:19,528 --> 01:19:20,956
And he offered me bribes.

1107
01:19:21,358 --> 01:19:22,777
Including his daughter.

1108
01:19:23,382 --> 01:19:25,821
He sent her to my hotel room.
She was only seventeen.

1109
01:19:27,890 --> 01:19:29,698
When she refused to leave.

1110
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:33,951
She was sick on the floor telling me
of the things that went on at Curragh.

1111
01:19:34,906 --> 01:19:36,028
Her mother was dead.

1112
01:19:37,079 --> 01:19:39,160
She lived alone in the
house with her father.

1113
01:19:39,746 --> 01:19:42,353
The father who was accustomed
to so much affection.

1114
01:19:44,402 --> 01:19:45,643
Then I married her.

1115
01:19:46,205 --> 01:19:48,529
Shortly afterwards,
the prosecution was dropped.

1116
01:19:50,049 --> 01:19:50,983
Thank you.

1117
01:19:51,562 --> 01:19:52,784
For lack of evidence.

1118
01:19:53,137 --> 01:19:55,998
But Ferris thought it was a first
down payment on his daughter.

1119
01:19:59,576 --> 01:20:00,935
And then he began to visit us.

1120
01:20:01,398 --> 01:20:04,442
It was more and more expensive to
send him back to his country estate.

1121
01:20:06,265 --> 01:20:08,524
Then one day he took her
out in the car. He was drunk.

1122
01:20:09,045 --> 01:20:10,310
They had an accident.

1123
01:20:11,086 --> 01:20:13,310
Liane was knocked out.
Ferris wasn't hurt.

1124
01:20:14,974 --> 01:20:16,735
But I told her that he died.

1125
01:20:19,126 --> 01:20:20,674
I thought it would free her.

1126
01:20:21,879 --> 01:20:24,502
Instead of which .. he became
a beautiful memory to her.

1127
01:20:24,757 --> 01:20:26,087
And she began to live in a ..

1128
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:27,985
Child's world.

1129
01:20:30,448 --> 01:20:31,355
That's all.

1130
01:20:32,286 --> 01:20:34,698
Except that he demanded
more and more money.

1131
01:20:35,945 --> 01:20:38,146
He took a delight in
ringing me up at all hours.

1132
01:20:38,602 --> 01:20:41,130
You remember that phone you
heard and I denied hearing?

1133
01:20:41,478 --> 01:20:42,476
That was him.

1134
01:20:43,308 --> 01:20:45,153
Why couldn't you have
told me all this before?

1135
01:20:46,272 --> 01:20:47,602
I thought I wouldn't have to.

1136
01:20:49,942 --> 01:20:50,626
Sorry.

1137
01:20:52,579 --> 01:20:54,338
We'll have to talk
about it in the morning.

1138
01:20:54,551 --> 01:20:55,306
No.

1139
01:20:56,196 --> 01:20:57,708
No, I'm going in the morning.

1140
01:20:58,940 --> 01:21:01,182
There is no reason for
me to stay any longer.

1141
01:21:47,878 --> 01:21:48,954
Christine.

1142
01:21:49,488 --> 01:21:50,512
Did you see this?

1143
01:21:52,075 --> 01:21:53,230
Pretty, isn't it?

1144
01:21:55,542 --> 01:21:56,703
It's very old.

1145
01:21:57,547 --> 01:21:59,483
Oh Liane .. you shouldn't
have taken that.

1146
01:22:02,307 --> 01:22:03,530
He gave it to me.

1147
01:22:04,892 --> 01:22:06,560
My father gave it to me.

1148
01:22:08,421 --> 01:22:10,097
She didn't want him to, but he gave it.

1149
01:22:12,076 --> 01:22:13,112
Take these.

1150
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:19,807
Why? Do you want to kill me, Christine?

1151
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:25,311
Take them, Liane. They are
just to make you sleep.

1152
01:22:27,731 --> 01:22:29,972
It would be nice if I was
out of the way, wouldn't it?

1153
01:22:30,834 --> 01:22:32,622
Then you could have
Stephen all to yourself.

1154
01:22:33,684 --> 01:22:34,916
Take them, Liane.

1155
01:22:43,276 --> 01:22:44,573
Ah .. nasty.

1156
01:22:49,186 --> 01:22:50,751
He did give me this, you know.

1157
01:22:54,226 --> 01:22:56,168
That proves that he
loves me, doesn't it?

1158
01:22:59,207 --> 01:23:00,400
That is true, isn't it?

1159
01:23:01,007 --> 01:23:02,723
Yes. Of course it's true.

1160
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:04,685
You sleep now.

1161
01:23:50,584 --> 01:23:52,052
Just a moment, Miss Godden.

1162
01:23:52,537 --> 01:23:54,999
Would you wait in your room?
I'd like to speak to you.

1163
01:23:58,834 --> 01:24:01,108
Was .. was she very restless last night?

1164
01:24:02,442 --> 01:24:04,319
No. Not especially restless.

1165
01:24:05,028 --> 01:24:06,759
You didn't hear anything
during the night?

1166
01:24:07,052 --> 01:24:07,935
Any movement?

1167
01:24:09,572 --> 01:24:10,267
No.

1168
01:24:10,909 --> 01:24:12,468
What's wrong? What's happened to her?

1169
01:24:12,721 --> 01:24:14,901
Mrs Dane died in the night, Miss Godden.

1170
01:24:19,417 --> 01:24:20,139
I've ..

1171
01:24:25,874 --> 01:24:28,321
Well, she was perfectly
alright when I left her.

1172
01:24:31,307 --> 01:24:32,816
What .. what time was that?

1173
01:24:33,968 --> 01:24:36,782
Well, I don't know exactly.
It must have been about ..

1174
01:24:37,203 --> 01:24:39,185
Did you .. did you give her the pills?

1175
01:24:39,748 --> 01:24:42,027
Yes .. two. Just as you told me.

1176
01:24:42,897 --> 01:24:43,655
Just two?

1177
01:24:44,745 --> 01:24:45,617
Are you sure?

1178
01:24:46,795 --> 01:24:48,220
Of course I'm sure.

1179
01:24:48,615 --> 01:24:50,432
I'll show you the bottle.
You can count them.

1180
01:24:54,852 --> 01:24:57,008
The bottle was right here.

1181
01:24:57,951 --> 01:24:58,938
I put it here.

1182
01:25:05,290 --> 01:25:06,627
I know it was here.

1183
01:25:09,284 --> 01:25:10,401
It's just like.

1184
01:25:11,043 --> 01:25:12,205
Like what, Miss Godden?

1185
01:25:14,727 --> 01:25:15,713
Nothing.

1186
01:25:42,877 --> 01:25:44,487
Death. Be not proud.

1187
01:25:44,894 --> 01:25:47,153
Though some have called
Thee mighty and dreadful.

1188
01:25:48,085 --> 01:25:49,035
Allow it no so.

1189
01:25:50,586 --> 01:25:54,612
I must apologise for this unwarranted
intrusion in your private grief Mr Dane.

1190
01:25:55,952 --> 01:25:56,717
Yes.

1191
01:25:57,270 --> 01:26:00,404
Your fame has already reached
this peaceful but primitive spot.

1192
01:26:00,861 --> 01:26:04,079
But I must introduce myself.
My name is Conson. Sean Conson.

1193
01:26:04,785 --> 01:26:07,100
May I walk a bit of the road with you?
- By all means.

1194
01:26:09,175 --> 01:26:10,601
Only the other day I was ..

1195
01:26:12,343 --> 01:26:15,473
I was admiring your masterful
handling of Crown versus Marchant.

1196
01:26:16,318 --> 01:26:19,222
Not that I claim any
erudition in these matters.

1197
01:26:20,128 --> 01:26:24,069
I simply read these cases as an antidote
against the total rusting of the mind.

1198
01:26:24,914 --> 01:26:27,316
There isn't much to stimulate
it around here I'm afraid.

1199
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:31,072
Hence the national addiction to drinking
good whiskey and writing bad poetry.

1200
01:26:31,318 --> 01:26:33,051
I take it you're in
the legal profession.

1201
01:26:33,596 --> 01:26:34,812
On the very fringe of it.

1202
01:26:35,198 --> 01:26:38,553
That's why it's such an honour to meet
you, Mr Dane, and such an embarrassment.

1203
01:26:39,456 --> 01:26:40,503
I don't understand.

1204
01:26:40,855 --> 01:26:43,846
Who am I to unravel the mysterious
workings of the human mind?

1205
01:26:44,585 --> 01:26:47,058
'Caverns measureless to man',
as Coleridge put it.

1206
01:26:48,332 --> 01:26:50,692
And yet, that is what I will have
to do tomorrow at the inquest.

1207
01:26:51,253 --> 01:26:52,406
In your presence.

1208
01:26:53,664 --> 01:26:55,037
Inquest? What for?

1209
01:26:55,846 --> 01:26:58,876
Well, it isn't unnatural
to have an inquest, is it?

1210
01:26:59,409 --> 01:27:03,688
Especially as a post-mortem established
she died from the overdose of a drug.

1211
01:27:05,708 --> 01:27:08,368
I've been a coroner around
her a great many years.

1212
01:27:08,770 --> 01:27:11,360
Each time there is an inquest
I feel utterly inadequate.

1213
01:27:12,289 --> 01:27:15,007
Have you met Miss Allison?
- No, I haven't had the pleasure.

1214
01:27:16,010 --> 01:27:17,338
Did you say 'Miss Allison'?

1215
01:27:18,376 --> 01:27:19,177
Yes.

1216
01:27:20,136 --> 01:27:23,288
My mistake .. I thought you had
registered in the hotel as Miss Godden.

1217
01:27:24,087 --> 01:27:26,473
So I am.
- Ah. Quite, quite.

1218
01:27:27,034 --> 01:27:28,276
What's in a name?

1219
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:30,730
A rose by any other name
would smell just a sweet.

1220
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:33,339
Shakespeare, of course.

1221
01:27:52,616 --> 01:27:53,769
You don't understand.

1222
01:27:54,358 --> 01:27:57,041
I only gave her two of those
tablets. I'm positive of that.

1223
01:27:57,267 --> 01:27:58,301
I believe you.

1224
01:27:58,609 --> 01:27:59,357
Hello.

1225
01:28:00,364 --> 01:28:02,123
Having quite a little
party, aren't they.

1226
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:04,486
Just listen to that.

1227
01:28:04,925 --> 01:28:06,940
Of course it's habitual
after a funeral, isn't it.

1228
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:09,329
Go away, Ferris.
- I wouldn't take it personally.

1229
01:28:09,556 --> 01:28:11,808
Mr Dane. After all I
suppose it's only human.

1230
01:28:12,090 --> 01:28:15,122
To want to celebrate the
pleasure of being .. alive.

1231
01:28:15,704 --> 01:28:17,336
But of course, you're free.

1232
01:28:17,586 --> 01:28:19,808
You don't have to hold your
breath and look sullen anymore.

1233
01:28:21,264 --> 01:28:24,707
You don't have to go round the house on
tiptoe as the wife's having one of ..

1234
01:28:25,228 --> 01:28:26,572
Her bad turns.

1235
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:33,012
I just imagine it must have
been pretty awkward with ..

1236
01:28:33,337 --> 01:28:35,413
With Liane there in the house. Huh?

1237
01:28:39,236 --> 01:28:41,152
A whiskey and water, please.
- A large one.

1238
01:28:43,387 --> 01:28:45,245
Ah yes, poor Liane.

1239
01:28:45,454 --> 01:28:47,708
Please don't think I don't
understand, because I do.

1240
01:28:48,621 --> 01:28:50,673
I went through exactly the same thing.

1241
01:28:51,503 --> 01:28:53,559
With her mother. Out with
every man in the district.

1242
01:28:54,232 --> 01:28:55,899
Do you know I actually ..

1243
01:28:56,546 --> 01:28:58,397
Once I found her in the kitchen ..

1244
01:28:58,860 --> 01:29:00,496
With a man I owed money to.

1245
01:29:01,355 --> 01:29:03,150
Of course, I couldn't
do anything about it.

1246
01:29:03,371 --> 01:29:06,045
On account of the financial aspect.

1247
01:29:08,866 --> 01:29:10,482
Yes. And then there is the other thing.

1248
01:29:11,148 --> 01:29:14,319
Once the dear one has departed
the fellow is free, isn't he.

1249
01:29:14,996 --> 01:29:17,924
To make alternative arrangements.
Isn't that so, Mr Dane?

1250
01:29:18,751 --> 01:29:21,725
So it's quite a cheerful sound really,
isn't it? When you come to think of it.

1251
01:29:23,018 --> 01:29:25,649
I mean death lifts all our burdens.

1252
01:29:28,431 --> 01:29:31,404
Stephen Dane, barrister at law.
Liverpool.

1253
01:29:32,220 --> 01:29:33,886
The doctor has told us, Mr Dane.

1254
01:29:34,130 --> 01:29:36,798
That your wife died of an
overdose of sleeping pills.

1255
01:29:37,189 --> 01:29:38,403
So I understand.

1256
01:29:38,755 --> 01:29:41,801
When you engaged Miss Allison as a
nurse and companion for your wife.

1257
01:29:42,329 --> 01:29:44,705
Did she show you any references?
- No.

1258
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:46,771
Oh. You had met
Miss Allison before, then?

1259
01:29:47,724 --> 01:29:50,045
Yes, but I don't see what it
has to do with this enquiry.

1260
01:29:52,035 --> 01:29:53,925
You must excuse us, Mr Dane.

1261
01:29:54,454 --> 01:29:57,107
We are not used, perhaps,
to the ways of the higher courts.

1262
01:29:57,207 --> 01:29:59,766
So we have to grope for the
truth in our own rusty way.

1263
01:30:00,518 --> 01:30:03,109
Now may I ask you, how
did you meet Miss Allison?

1264
01:30:04,010 --> 01:30:05,512
I met her in the course of my work.

1265
01:30:05,656 --> 01:30:07,640
You had defended her in some case?

1266
01:30:08,476 --> 01:30:10,965
No, I .. I conducted the prosecution.

1267
01:30:12,969 --> 01:30:14,544
For what offence, may one ask?

1268
01:30:19,233 --> 01:30:21,505
If there is something you
want to keep from us ..

1269
01:30:23,528 --> 01:30:24,989
She was accused of killing a man.

1270
01:30:26,343 --> 01:30:27,364
Some accident?

1271
01:30:28,575 --> 01:30:30,163
No. She gave him an overdose of drugs.

1272
01:30:31,059 --> 01:30:32,341
Then she was acquitted?

1273
01:30:33,203 --> 01:30:36,029
No, she was .. found
guilty of manslaughter.

1274
01:30:37,134 --> 01:30:38,092
Of manslaughter?

1275
01:30:39,131 --> 01:30:40,054
I see.

1276
01:30:41,462 --> 01:30:42,506
Thank you, Mr Dane.

1277
01:30:42,883 --> 01:30:43,851
Thank you.

1278
01:30:44,787 --> 01:30:45,888
Miss Allison, please.

1279
01:30:48,165 --> 01:30:50,676
Take this in your right hand
and repeat what's on the card.

1280
01:30:52,514 --> 01:30:54,245
I swear by Almighty God ..

1281
01:30:54,741 --> 01:30:57,442
That the evidence I shall give shall
be the truth, the whole truth ..

1282
01:30:57,542 --> 01:30:58,832
And nothing but the truth.

1283
01:31:00,041 --> 01:31:00,970
Miss Allison.

1284
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:03,586
The doctor has told us
that in his opinion.

1285
01:31:04,287 --> 01:31:06,295
Mrs Dane would have had
to have been certified.

1286
01:31:06,803 --> 01:31:08,363
Do you think her case was hopeless?

1287
01:31:09,898 --> 01:31:12,021
I have been struck from
the medical register.

1288
01:31:12,555 --> 01:31:14,790
And I'm not entitled to give
you my opinion as a doctor.

1289
01:31:15,141 --> 01:31:17,464
I see .. now, Miss Allison.

1290
01:31:18,362 --> 01:31:20,519
You needn't answer
this if you don't want to.

1291
01:31:21,329 --> 01:31:24,126
But are you a believer in what's
been called 'mercy killing'?

1292
01:31:28,310 --> 01:31:30,269
Under certain circumstances.

1293
01:31:30,861 --> 01:31:33,953
When one can no longer bear to see
the pain and agony of the patient.

1294
01:31:34,348 --> 01:31:37,574
You can't ever kill without destroying
something inside yourself.

1295
01:31:38,166 --> 01:31:39,085
I see.

1296
01:31:40,389 --> 01:31:42,147
Now, as far as Mrs Dane is concerned.

1297
01:31:42,642 --> 01:31:45,479
You say that you didn't give her more
pills than the doctor prescribed.

1298
01:31:45,708 --> 01:31:46,609
But I did not.

1299
01:31:46,728 --> 01:31:49,157
There was no-one else in the room
was there, so far as you know?

1300
01:31:50,190 --> 01:31:50,841
No.

1301
01:31:51,219 --> 01:31:53,192
And the bottle was in
your room, Miss Allison?

1302
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:55,644
Yes. Yes, it was there
when I went to bed.

1303
01:31:55,744 --> 01:31:57,160
And gone the next day?

1304
01:31:58,769 --> 01:31:59,667
Yes.

1305
01:32:00,441 --> 01:32:02,020
It hasn't been found yet?

1306
01:32:03,142 --> 01:32:06,421
Now could you offer any
suggestions? For our assistance.

1307
01:32:06,974 --> 01:32:08,769
Think now, if you would be so kind.

1308
01:32:11,767 --> 01:32:13,263
I can't think.

1309
01:32:14,451 --> 01:32:16,026
I just don't understand it.

1310
01:32:16,607 --> 01:32:18,111
It's all too much like ..

1311
01:32:19,268 --> 01:32:20,438
What happened before.

1312
01:32:21,028 --> 01:32:23,592
Isn't that a rather dangerous statement
for you to make, Miss Allison?

1313
01:32:23,784 --> 01:32:24,820
I object, sir.

1314
01:32:25,044 --> 01:32:26,926
This is supposed to be
an inquest on my wife.

1315
01:32:27,026 --> 01:32:28,870
You're now accusing
Miss Allison of murder.

1316
01:32:29,778 --> 01:32:32,376
She hasn't been warned, she hasn't
been charged. It's most irregular.

1317
01:32:32,476 --> 01:32:33,919
Did you say 'murder' Mr Dane?

1318
01:32:34,126 --> 01:32:35,219
Yes. Murder.

1319
01:32:35,319 --> 01:32:37,998
I'm under the impression sir,
that's what is being implied.

1320
01:32:38,301 --> 01:32:40,081
Do you want an opportunity,
Miss Allison ..

1321
01:32:40,181 --> 01:32:42,819
To deal with the charge that
only Mr Dane has made as yet?

1322
01:32:42,995 --> 01:32:44,675
I didn't say ..
- Yes, you did.

1323
01:32:48,272 --> 01:32:50,362
You said it so that
everybody could think it.

1324
01:32:51,487 --> 01:32:53,304
Because that's what
you've planned, isn't it?

1325
01:32:54,162 --> 01:32:55,451
That's why I'm here.

1326
01:32:56,155 --> 01:32:57,967
That's why you looked
for me and found me.

1327
01:32:58,214 --> 01:33:01,037
That's why you waited all that time
for me to come out of prison.

1328
01:33:01,907 --> 01:33:04,823
Because you needed someone
that people could point to.

1329
01:33:05,329 --> 01:33:07,066
'We know her. We know what she did'.

1330
01:33:07,735 --> 01:33:11,189
'We know what happened the last time she
took care of somebody she cared about'.

1331
01:33:12,868 --> 01:33:15,517
I was the one person in the
whole world you needed.

1332
01:33:15,967 --> 01:33:17,822
Because you knew this
was going to happen.

1333
01:33:20,927 --> 01:33:23,687
Miss Allison, please let me
understand what you're saying.

1334
01:33:23,847 --> 01:33:26,806
Mr Coroner, Mr Dane
understands what I'm saying.

1335
01:33:27,262 --> 01:33:29,868
Because he's such a clever
lawyer. He's so brilliant.

1336
01:33:30,425 --> 01:33:32,506
And he's so kind and sympathetic.

1337
01:33:33,856 --> 01:33:36,825
He'll send you to prison and then when
you get out he'll give you a job.

1338
01:33:36,925 --> 01:33:38,499
Because he understands.

1339
01:33:39,601 --> 01:33:41,653
He understands how to use people.

1340
01:33:42,355 --> 01:33:44,591
And to fit them right into his plans.

1341
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:48,932
And I was such a fool I wasn't clever
enough to see what he was doing.

1342
01:33:50,281 --> 01:33:51,942
In your own interest, Miss Allison.

1343
01:33:52,175 --> 01:33:54,196
I think we ought to have
a short adjournment now.

1344
01:33:54,515 --> 01:33:55,988
You will want to collect yourself.

1345
01:33:56,756 --> 01:33:58,498
We'll resume this inquiry in an hour.

1346
01:34:46,853 --> 01:34:48,784
You certainly gave them
something to think about.

1347
01:34:49,696 --> 01:34:52,114
He was afraid alright. We could
see that. I was watching him.

1348
01:34:52,783 --> 01:34:54,628
Oh yes, and when you
came out with that stuff.

1349
01:34:55,782 --> 01:34:57,049
He was very scared.

1350
01:34:58,456 --> 01:35:01,410
Mind you, it's not you I blame. He was
behind it. I always felt sure of that.

1351
01:35:02,026 --> 01:35:03,664
I don't want to talk about it.
- No.

1352
01:35:04,650 --> 01:35:07,007
Well, it's about time people
knew the truth about Mr Dane.

1353
01:35:07,738 --> 01:35:08,670
Imagine.

1354
01:35:09,260 --> 01:35:11,534
Keeping a man from his daughter
all these years. What a mind.

1355
01:35:12,576 --> 01:35:14,450
To be able to think up
a scheme like that. Huh?

1356
01:35:16,863 --> 01:35:19,562
What time did he say we had to be back?
- Two o'clock, was it?

1357
01:35:26,649 --> 01:35:27,926
What time is it now?

1358
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:34,856
Hey, that's a beautiful watch.
- Yes, it was my grandfather's.

1359
01:35:35,657 --> 01:35:37,448
I've held on to that
through thick and thin.

1360
01:35:37,548 --> 01:35:39,449
How was Liane when you last saw her?

1361
01:35:40,232 --> 01:35:42,713
Well, you were there.
- I mean when you came to the hotel.

1362
01:35:43,276 --> 01:35:43,927
What?

1363
01:35:44,648 --> 01:35:46,557
Why did you go up to
her room that night?

1364
01:35:47,624 --> 01:35:48,449
What night?

1365
01:35:48,935 --> 01:35:49,927
Did I do that?

1366
01:35:50,027 --> 01:35:51,913
Well, you've got your
watch back, haven't you?

1367
01:35:52,328 --> 01:35:54,090
The watch she took from your house.

1368
01:35:54,293 --> 01:35:56,762
She was holding it in her hand
that night when she went to sleep.

1369
01:35:57,284 --> 01:35:59,444
She pretended that it was a
present that you'd given her.

1370
01:35:59,826 --> 01:36:03,226
When she was holding that watch in her
hand she was alive and now she's dead.

1371
01:36:03,453 --> 01:36:05,327
And you've got your watch back.
- Hmm.

1372
01:36:05,879 --> 01:36:07,050
Miss, what do you mean?

1373
01:36:07,150 --> 01:36:10,449
I mean you were there. You must
have been there. <i>You </i>killed her.

1374
01:36:12,762 --> 01:36:14,363
You don't know what you're saying.

1375
01:36:15,023 --> 01:36:17,016
I could tell that by the way
she gave her evidence.

1376
01:36:18,076 --> 01:36:20,466
She's out of her mind. She knows
not what she's says. Excuse me.

1377
01:36:20,566 --> 01:36:21,534
He was there!

1378
01:36:23,939 --> 01:36:25,322
You needn't look at me.

1379
01:36:25,797 --> 01:36:26,886
I didn't kill her.

1380
01:36:28,980 --> 01:36:31,169
Look, I just went up to tell
her to stay away. That's all.

1381
01:36:31,289 --> 01:36:34,297
For her own sake as well as anything.
Look can't you see that?

1382
01:36:34,693 --> 01:36:37,513
Look, I'm not a particularly <i>good</i> man.

1383
01:36:38,265 --> 01:36:39,621
Well. It was distressing.

1384
01:36:39,983 --> 01:36:42,429
Having her come out to the house
like that. Intruding into my life!

1385
01:36:43,887 --> 01:36:46,333
I wanted to warn her, that's all.
- How did you get the watch back?

1386
01:36:46,561 --> 01:36:48,301
Look, I didn't kill her!

1387
01:36:49,135 --> 01:36:50,894
I .. I had a couple of
drinks that evening.

1388
01:36:51,034 --> 01:36:53,881
When I went up I was going to advise her
to go home. To go home with her husband.

1389
01:36:55,097 --> 01:36:56,472
I thought it was only right.

1390
01:36:56,991 --> 01:36:59,982
And then when I pushed open the door,
there she was. She was lying on the bed.

1391
01:37:00,264 --> 01:37:01,508
With a bottle in her hand.

1392
01:37:01,627 --> 01:37:04,088
Empty. Empty. She'd taken a
whole fistful of these things.

1393
01:37:04,557 --> 01:37:06,718
Just like a kid .. like a kid.

1394
01:37:07,571 --> 01:37:10,038
Taking sweets. So I said
to myself afterwards.

1395
01:37:10,660 --> 01:37:14,099
Alright Mr Dane, but perhaps now we'll
give you something to explain away.

1396
01:37:14,353 --> 01:37:16,897
We'll give you, a little legal problem.

1397
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:18,930
Who does he think we are?

1398
01:37:20,061 --> 01:37:21,974
Does he think I'm a .. a servant?

1399
01:37:22,313 --> 01:37:24,673
Who he can pay off if he's giving
too much trouble in the house?

1400
01:37:26,519 --> 01:37:27,267
So, I ..

1401
01:37:28,683 --> 01:37:30,205
Well, I took the bottle.

1402
01:37:30,848 --> 01:37:32,107
I took the bottle with me.

1403
01:37:33,189 --> 01:37:34,576
What are you looking at me for?

1404
01:37:35,221 --> 01:37:36,294
I didn't kill her!

1405
01:37:37,148 --> 01:37:38,063
I ..

1406
01:37:42,882 --> 01:37:44,422
Just a moment, Mr Ferris.

1407
01:37:46,841 --> 01:37:48,575
Horrible! Ridiculous allegations.

1408
01:37:48,927 --> 01:37:51,144
My daughter was practically
gone when l came into the room.

1409
01:37:51,622 --> 01:37:53,738
I saw Liane taking these things.

1410
01:37:54,276 --> 01:37:56,264
I'm not responsible.
I had nothing to do with it.

1411
01:38:05,469 --> 01:38:06,659
Stand right back.

1412
01:38:07,730 --> 01:38:08,831
Now move away please.

1413
01:38:09,337 --> 01:38:10,308
Come on now.

1414
01:39:12,286 --> 01:39:13,136
Christine.

1415
01:39:14,021 --> 01:39:15,480
Are you going to give me a lift?

1416
01:39:58,019 --> 01:39:59,234
-t-g-
