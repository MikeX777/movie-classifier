00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:24,856
(grunting and scuffling)

12
00:03:29,694 --> 00:03:31,707
- You're getting better.

13
00:03:31,707 --> 00:03:34,074
- I had a good teacher.

14
00:03:34,074 --> 00:03:37,491
(grunting and scuffling)

15
00:04:11,223 --> 00:04:12,181
- [Man] Hey kid, I'm proud of you,

16
00:04:12,181 --> 00:04:13,764
let me help you up.

17
00:04:17,913 --> 00:04:19,814
- Rule number one,

18
00:04:19,814 --> 00:04:22,801
never trust the opponent, remember?

19
00:04:22,801 --> 00:04:25,051
(laughing)

20
00:04:34,071 --> 00:04:36,488

(guns firing)

36
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,263
- Okay, gentlemen,

37
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,480
you've just witness the raid

38
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,964
on General Ortega's secret drug camp

39
00:09:50,964 --> 00:09:53,064
in Sumander South America.

40
00:09:53,064 --> 00:09:54,148
The raiding party consisting

41
00:09:54,148 --> 00:09:57,455
of all four branches of the armed forces,

42
00:09:57,455 --> 00:09:59,230
code name NAMA.

43
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,932
The raiding party completely
destroyed the camp,

44
00:10:01,932 --> 00:10:03,844
which produces enormous quantities

45
00:10:03,844 --> 00:10:06,242
of elicit drugs on the world market.

46
00:10:06,242 --> 00:10:08,915
Now all the members of
the special forces team

47
00:10:08,915 --> 00:10:11,225
have either been killed or wounded

48
00:10:11,225 --> 00:10:13,926
by what we suspect is
General Oretga's hit men

49
00:10:13,926 --> 00:10:16,504
in retaliation to the raid.

50
00:10:16,504 --> 00:10:19,590
Gentlemen, the killings must be stopped.

51
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,726
- What about the surviving members,

52
00:10:20,726 --> 00:10:22,079
have they been forewarned?

53
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,034
- No, not yet.

54
00:10:23,034 --> 00:10:24,624
That's why I brought you two together,

55
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,055
to help develop a special plan

56
00:10:26,055 --> 00:10:28,848
to safeguard them and their families.

57
00:10:28,848 --> 00:10:30,831
- And how about their team leaders?

58
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:32,681
- Mark Mitchell, code name Cobra,

59
00:10:32,681 --> 00:10:35,885
and Ray Davis, code name Black Mamba.

60
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,813
Gentlemen, you must do everything you can

61
00:10:37,813 --> 00:10:38,959
to protect them.

62
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,631
After all, the American government

63
00:10:40,631 --> 00:10:42,317
owes them this much.

64
00:10:42,317 --> 00:10:44,220
- We'll do everything we can, sir.

65
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,293
- Yeah, we'll even give them

66
00:10:45,293 --> 00:10:46,403
round the clock protection

67
00:10:46,403 --> 00:10:48,409
if you want us to, Chief Brent.

68
00:10:48,409 --> 00:10:49,958
- Good luck.

69
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:54,041
(suspenseful instrumental music)

70
00:11:19,738 --> 00:11:22,155
(gun firing)

71
00:11:24,921 --> 00:11:26,421
- Leaving so soon?

72
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,402
(screaming)

73
00:11:31,402 --> 00:11:33,069
- [Woman] Let me go!

74
00:11:36,022 --> 00:11:36,855
Let me go!

75
00:11:41,456 --> 00:11:43,873
(gun firing)

76
00:11:54,303 --> 00:11:55,803
- Out sucker, out!

77
00:11:59,047 --> 00:11:59,880
Come here.

78
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:02,055
You see that?

79
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,328
You see that?

80
00:12:03,328 --> 00:12:07,411
(suspenseful instrumental music)

81
00:12:11,777 --> 00:12:12,668
- [Man] No, no.

82
00:12:12,668 --> 00:12:15,085
(gun firing)

83
00:12:17,631 --> 00:12:19,798
(sobbing)

84
00:12:22,347 --> 00:12:23,839
- You're a lousy lay, you slut.

85
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,256
(gun firing)

86
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,478
(gun firing)

87
00:12:52,494 --> 00:12:54,911
(gun firing)

88
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,458
(guns firing)

89
00:13:37,425 --> 00:13:39,281
- What's the matter,
cop, you trying chicken?

90
00:13:39,281 --> 00:13:41,531
(laughing)

91
00:13:42,535 --> 00:13:43,368
Come on.

92
00:13:43,368 --> 00:13:45,618
(laughing)

93
00:13:48,838 --> 00:13:52,005
- You have the right to remain silent.

94
00:13:54,198 --> 00:13:56,948
(loud exploding)

95
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,173
- Pure grade.

96
00:14:21,173 --> 00:14:22,006
- Come on.

97
00:14:22,006 --> 00:14:23,423
Where's my money?

98
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,854
- It's all here.

99
00:14:26,854 --> 00:14:30,437
(funky instrumental music)

100
00:14:52,547 --> 00:14:53,803
- [Man] There's the police!

101
00:14:53,803 --> 00:14:55,584
They've got you surrounded!

102
00:14:55,584 --> 00:14:56,657
- I shouldn't have come here,

103
00:14:56,657 --> 00:14:58,357
I thought we were safe.

104
00:14:58,357 --> 00:14:59,190
Dumb shit.

105
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,378
- Let's go, let's go.

106
00:15:00,378 --> 00:15:03,878
(funky suspenseful music)

107
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:12,486
- Freeze, you maggots!

108
00:15:12,486 --> 00:15:14,986
(guns firing)

109
00:15:24,835 --> 00:15:27,335
(guns firing)

110
00:15:29,842 --> 00:15:30,675
- Come on!

111
00:15:33,216 --> 00:15:35,633
(gun firing)

112
00:15:43,697 --> 00:15:45,529
- You can't outrun old Smithy.

113
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:46,880
Now drop it.

114
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,255
Against the wall.

115
00:15:48,255 --> 00:15:50,370
Come on, you too.

116
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,282
Come on, punk.

117
00:15:52,282 --> 00:15:55,687
Against the wall, against that wall.

118
00:15:55,687 --> 00:15:57,309
So you're the big fish.

119
00:15:57,309 --> 00:15:58,142
Come on.

120
00:16:05,577 --> 00:16:08,577
(suspenseful music)

121
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:11,069
- Freeze!

122
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:15,890
Who are you guys?

123
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:18,001
And what the hell are you doing here?

124
00:16:18,001 --> 00:16:19,454
- No wonder they call you Cobra,

125
00:16:19,454 --> 00:16:21,811
you're really fast.

126
00:16:21,811 --> 00:16:24,978
I'm agent Wagner and these are my men.

127
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:27,705
Now you take it easy on that gun,

128
00:16:27,705 --> 00:16:28,828
I'll bring out my credentials

129
00:16:28,828 --> 00:16:31,535
and explain everything.

130
00:16:31,535 --> 00:16:32,810
- Watch it.

131
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:33,810
- It's okay.

132
00:16:41,014 --> 00:16:43,514
- So you're with the big boys.

133
00:16:46,752 --> 00:16:49,497
- Sorry to barge into your apartment but,

134
00:16:49,497 --> 00:16:51,758
we wanted to make sure that no one is here

135
00:16:51,758 --> 00:16:54,097
waiting for you in ambush.

136
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:54,930
- Ambush?

137
00:16:55,898 --> 00:16:59,395
I know I'm not very popular
in this neighborhood but,

138
00:16:59,395 --> 00:17:00,369
what the hell's going on?

139
00:17:00,369 --> 00:17:01,539
- Most of your men have been killed

140
00:17:01,539 --> 00:17:03,475
involved in a raid on General Ortega,

141
00:17:03,475 --> 00:17:04,628
that's why we're here.

142
00:17:04,628 --> 00:17:06,964
To warn you and to protect you.

143
00:17:06,964 --> 00:17:08,955
- But that raid on Ortega happened

144
00:17:08,955 --> 00:17:10,207
a long time ago.

145
00:17:10,207 --> 00:17:11,159
- We've also sent a team

146
00:17:11,159 --> 00:17:14,492
to look after your wife and your sister.

147
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:18,643
- Well I guess that's just
the hazards of the trade.

148
00:17:18,643 --> 00:17:20,327
What do you say?

149
00:17:20,327 --> 00:17:22,020
- So I hope you don't mind me and my men

150
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,365
staying here close to you,

151
00:17:23,365 --> 00:17:25,428
wherever you go, whatever you do.

152
00:17:25,428 --> 00:17:27,928
(guns firing)

153
00:17:43,206 --> 00:17:45,623
(gun firing)

154
00:17:46,993 --> 00:17:47,993
- Catherine.

155
00:18:07,374 --> 00:18:08,610
- Don't worry Mrs. Mitchell,

156
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,128
your husband is safe.

157
00:18:10,128 --> 00:18:11,489
I assure you, right now,

158
00:18:11,489 --> 00:18:12,972
a whole contingent of our best agents

159
00:18:12,972 --> 00:18:15,104
are watching over him.

160
00:18:15,104 --> 00:18:17,361
Nothing can happen to him
while we're on the job.

161
00:18:17,361 --> 00:18:20,423
- I have total confidence
in my brother, Mr. Phillips,

162
00:18:20,423 --> 00:18:22,025
with or without your help.

163
00:18:22,025 --> 00:18:24,052
Mark can take care of himself.

164
00:18:24,052 --> 00:18:26,120
- Cobra has an outstanding record.

165
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,590
Our boss, Chief Brent

166
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,676
wouldn't give him this special concern.

167
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:31,276
Our agency values people

168
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,468
who serve their country well.

169
00:18:33,468 --> 00:18:35,267
- I'll go check the kitchen out.

170
00:18:35,267 --> 00:18:38,184
Catherine, Mr. Phillips, excuse me.

171
00:18:39,894 --> 00:18:42,428
- You know, I don't like what's going on.

172
00:18:42,428 --> 00:18:44,345
I wish Mark would quit.

173
00:18:45,748 --> 00:18:46,836
- It's okay, honey,

174
00:18:46,836 --> 00:18:48,105
they know what they're doing,

175
00:18:48,105 --> 00:18:50,113
don't worry about it.

176
00:18:50,113 --> 00:18:51,563
Breakfast ready yet?

177
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:52,896
- I'll go check.

178
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:06,385
(eerie instrumental music)

179
00:19:06,385 --> 00:19:08,718
(scuffling)

180
00:19:17,922 --> 00:19:19,160
(gun firing)

181
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,533
(suspenseful instrumental music)

182
00:19:20,533 --> 00:19:22,398
- Take cover.

183
00:19:22,398 --> 00:19:24,815
(gun firing)

184
00:19:32,207 --> 00:19:34,000
(screams)

185
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,417
(gun firing)

186
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,511
- [Man] Where's Mark's sister?

187
00:19:53,511 --> 00:19:55,475
- [Man] Not around.

188
00:19:55,475 --> 00:19:57,171
- Well spread out and find her.

189
00:19:57,171 --> 00:19:58,004
Let's go.

190
00:20:52,563 --> 00:20:53,851
- Catherine!

191
00:20:53,851 --> 00:20:54,684
Carol!

192
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,557
No, Catherine!

193
00:21:03,557 --> 00:21:05,726
No, Catherine, please.

194
00:21:05,726 --> 00:21:08,220
Don't be dead, Catherine.

195
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,387
No, Catherine.

196
00:21:13,717 --> 00:21:14,550
No.

197
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:17,578
Oh Catherine, please.

198
00:21:17,578 --> 00:21:18,411
Why, why!

199
00:21:23,455 --> 00:21:27,288
(energetic suspenseful music)

200
00:22:10,768 --> 00:22:12,185
- Hey!
- Hey, Ray!

201
00:22:15,498 --> 00:22:17,831
(scuffling)

202
00:22:19,025 --> 00:22:21,432
- You got three seconds to talk, talk!

203
00:22:21,432 --> 00:22:23,487
- Hey man, hey quit it man.

204
00:22:23,487 --> 00:22:25,032
We're in the same league.

205
00:22:25,032 --> 00:22:27,366
We only came to fetch you for Chief Brent.

206
00:22:27,366 --> 00:22:29,265
- Now I wanna see some IDs.

207
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,456
Now slowly, babe.

208
00:22:31,456 --> 00:22:33,289
Slowly, nice and easy.

209
00:22:35,207 --> 00:22:36,040
That's it.

210
00:22:41,952 --> 00:22:44,866
CIA, Jesus, you dumb shit!

211
00:22:44,866 --> 00:22:47,231
You almost bought it, shit.

212
00:22:47,231 --> 00:22:48,147
You guys should know better

213
00:22:48,147 --> 00:22:49,480
to follow a cop.

214
00:22:50,524 --> 00:22:51,941
Sorry about that.

215
00:22:54,227 --> 00:22:56,486
- Okay Ray, I'll get to the point.

216
00:22:56,486 --> 00:22:58,928
We've asked you here
because we need your help.

217
00:22:58,928 --> 00:23:00,908
Your friend Mark, code name Cobra

218
00:23:00,908 --> 00:23:02,195
has been kidnapped.

219
00:23:02,195 --> 00:23:03,195
- Kidnapped?

220
00:23:04,281 --> 00:23:05,871
You must be mistaken,

221
00:23:05,871 --> 00:23:08,213
no one can kidnap Cobra.

222
00:23:08,213 --> 00:23:10,318
He's mean and he's bad.

223
00:23:10,318 --> 00:23:12,009
- I wish I was mistaken Ray,

224
00:23:12,009 --> 00:23:13,297
but they've got him

225
00:23:13,297 --> 00:23:15,725
and we need you to help rescue him.

226
00:23:15,725 --> 00:23:17,571
- Sure I'll do it.

227
00:23:17,571 --> 00:23:19,313
Who's responsible?

228
00:23:19,313 --> 00:23:20,756
- General Ortega.

229
00:23:20,756 --> 00:23:22,240
- Shit!

230
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,432
That son of a bitch never learned.

231
00:23:25,432 --> 00:23:26,735
When do I leave, sir?

232
00:23:26,735 --> 00:23:28,152
- We've prepared some forged documents

233
00:23:28,152 --> 00:23:29,470
to help you get in the country.

234
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:30,824
Your flight leaves tonight

235
00:23:30,824 --> 00:23:31,756
and Ray, I'd appreciate it

236
00:23:31,756 --> 00:23:35,003
if you keep me posted on
what's going on there.

237
00:23:35,003 --> 00:23:36,035
- Consider it done.

238
00:23:36,035 --> 00:23:36,868
Sure.

239
00:24:04,204 --> 00:24:07,704
(eerie suspenseful music)

240
00:24:22,596 --> 00:24:25,346
(bomb exploding)

241
00:25:25,218 --> 00:25:28,968
(dramatic suspenseful music)

242
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,630
(bomb exploding)

243
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:25,681
(gun firing)

244
00:27:39,504 --> 00:27:42,004
(guns firing)

245
00:28:15,772 --> 00:28:18,772
(grenade exploding)

246
00:28:59,266 --> 00:29:01,683
(gun firing)

247
00:29:11,355 --> 00:29:14,355
(grenade exploding)

248
00:29:38,469 --> 00:29:41,552
(airplane whooshing)

249
00:29:46,654 --> 00:29:49,821
(gentle upbeat music)

250
00:29:54,196 --> 00:29:57,696
- Driver, take me Sumander Military Camp.

251
00:29:57,696 --> 00:29:59,446
- [Driver] Si, senor.

252
00:30:20,222 --> 00:30:21,788
- Quite impressive, sergeant.

253
00:30:21,788 --> 00:30:25,205
We need instructors like you in our camp.

254
00:30:27,151 --> 00:30:30,151
Take Sergeant Davis to his quarters.

255
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:34,613
Welcome to our camp, sergeant.

256
00:30:34,613 --> 00:30:36,124
Hope you'll enjoy it here.

257
00:30:36,124 --> 00:30:37,796
- I'm sure I'll do, sir.

258
00:30:37,796 --> 00:30:39,863
- This man will show you to your quarters.

259
00:30:39,863 --> 00:30:40,863
- Thank you.

260
00:30:48,225 --> 00:30:49,205
- I can't understand

261
00:30:49,205 --> 00:30:52,288
why we have to hire a mercenary, sir.

262
00:30:54,141 --> 00:30:56,029
- They'd do anything for money,

263
00:30:56,029 --> 00:30:58,279
even kill their own mother.

264
00:30:59,663 --> 00:31:01,426
They're practically your slaves

265
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:03,509
ready to do your bidding.

266
00:31:06,029 --> 00:31:09,395
- Here's your breakfast, senorita.

267
00:31:09,395 --> 00:31:10,395
- Thank you.

268
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:15,727
(gentle instrumental music)

269
00:31:56,542 --> 00:31:57,375
Want some?

270
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:36,434
(dramatic suspenseful music)

271
00:33:31,155 --> 00:33:34,322
- And where do you think you're going?

272
00:33:48,587 --> 00:33:51,249
- Ah, Bermudez, come in please.

273
00:33:51,249 --> 00:33:52,082
Come in.

274
00:33:55,826 --> 00:33:57,050
You don't know how happy I am

275
00:33:57,050 --> 00:34:00,757
at the exemplary execution of your duties.

276
00:34:00,757 --> 00:34:02,389
This is why I invited you here,

277
00:34:02,389 --> 00:34:04,979
to personally thank you
for a job well done.

278
00:34:04,979 --> 00:34:07,312
- It is nothing, me general.

279
00:34:09,194 --> 00:34:10,289
- They should know better

280
00:34:10,289 --> 00:34:13,314
than to tangle with General Muriel Ortega.

281
00:34:13,314 --> 00:34:15,647
Now it is too late for them!

282
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:21,622
Commandant, I want you to squeeze Cobra

283
00:34:21,622 --> 00:34:22,872
until he's dry.

284
00:34:24,004 --> 00:34:26,921
Drain every last drop of his blood.

285
00:34:27,916 --> 00:34:31,166
I want him to suffer excruciating pain.

286
00:34:32,382 --> 00:34:33,470
And when you're finished

287
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:35,932
feed his bones to the dog.

288
00:34:35,932 --> 00:34:37,782
Only then will he be able to compensate

289
00:34:37,782 --> 00:34:39,863
for the humiliation

290
00:34:39,863 --> 00:34:42,522
that I have suffered at his hands.

291
00:34:42,522 --> 00:34:44,234
You don't know how terrible it is

292
00:34:44,234 --> 00:34:46,336
to lose face by a drug clan.

293
00:34:46,336 --> 00:34:47,978
I boasted of guaranteed protection

294
00:34:47,978 --> 00:34:50,196
for the drugs sent here to our laboratory

295
00:34:50,196 --> 00:34:51,963
for refinement.

296
00:34:51,963 --> 00:34:53,511
And what happens?

297
00:34:53,511 --> 00:34:55,697
They're blown away like that.

298
00:34:55,697 --> 00:34:57,739
I become the laughing stock of the world

299
00:34:57,739 --> 00:35:00,628
because of what they did.

300
00:35:00,628 --> 00:35:02,301
It's terrible.

301
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:06,184
Commandante, the
humiliation, it's terrible.

302
00:35:06,184 --> 00:35:08,462
- He will suffer, me General,

303
00:35:08,462 --> 00:35:09,629
I promise you.

304
00:35:11,831 --> 00:35:16,203
(speaking in foreign language)

305
00:35:16,203 --> 00:35:19,536
But before you go, I want
you to see something.

306
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:21,821
(speaking in foreign language)

307
00:35:21,821 --> 00:35:25,821
(foreboding instrumental music)

308
00:35:30,508 --> 00:35:33,985
Commandante, I would like
to present Senorita Carol,

309
00:35:33,985 --> 00:35:35,652
the sister of Cobra.

310
00:35:36,686 --> 00:35:38,019
She is my guest.

311
00:35:39,211 --> 00:35:40,842
An insurance you might say

312
00:35:40,842 --> 00:35:43,486
against any rescue attempt on Cobra.

313
00:35:43,486 --> 00:35:44,319
- I see.

314
00:35:45,801 --> 00:35:49,438
And when I have accomplished everything?

315
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:51,105
- She will be yours.

316
00:35:54,525 --> 00:35:56,534
(speaking in foreign language)

317
00:35:56,534 --> 00:36:00,534
(foreboding instrumental music)

318
00:36:11,206 --> 00:36:12,789
- [Guard] Stand up!

319
00:36:13,724 --> 00:36:15,141
- [Guard] Get up.

320
00:36:33,979 --> 00:36:36,229
(laughing)

321
00:36:45,475 --> 00:36:47,885
- Harder harder!
- Hut two three four,

322
00:36:47,885 --> 00:36:49,481
hut two three four.

323
00:36:49,481 --> 00:36:50,854
Hut two three four.

324
00:36:50,854 --> 00:36:52,464
Hut two three four.

325
00:36:52,464 --> 00:36:53,834
Hut two three four.

326
00:36:53,834 --> 00:36:55,209
Hut two three four.

327
00:36:55,209 --> 00:36:56,554
Hut two three four.

328
00:36:56,554 --> 00:36:57,387
Hut two three four.
- Come on.

329
00:36:57,387 --> 00:36:59,678
Come on.
- Hut two three four.

330
00:36:59,678 --> 00:37:01,393
Hut two three four.
- I said move it!

331
00:37:01,393 --> 00:37:02,851
- [Commandante] And this
is where we keep assholes

332
00:37:02,851 --> 00:37:05,684
that fight against our government.

333
00:37:08,653 --> 00:37:10,443
- [Ray] It seems that most of the cells

334
00:37:10,443 --> 00:37:13,085
are empty, Commandante.

335
00:37:13,085 --> 00:37:14,595
- [Commandante] So you've noticed that.

336
00:37:14,595 --> 00:37:16,571
It's always like that, sergeant.

337
00:37:16,571 --> 00:37:19,004
They usually don't stay
in their cells too long.

338
00:37:19,004 --> 00:37:20,951
After a day or two of torture,

339
00:37:20,951 --> 00:37:23,084
they're executed at once.

340
00:37:23,084 --> 00:37:26,721
It helps to reduce the
maintenance cost that way,

341
00:37:26,721 --> 00:37:27,554
you know.

342
00:37:31,565 --> 00:37:35,565
(foreboding instrumental music)

343
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,307
- Commandante.

344
00:37:44,814 --> 00:37:46,347
When's the big day for this one?

345
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:48,036
- The general wants to prolong his stay

346
00:37:48,036 --> 00:37:49,758
here for a while.

347
00:37:49,758 --> 00:37:54,218
He says he wants more special
treatment for his crimes.

348
00:37:54,218 --> 00:37:55,772
You can expect to see him here

349
00:37:55,772 --> 00:37:57,439
for a long time yet.

350
00:38:24,186 --> 00:38:26,470
- Commandante, I have just received

351
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,284
confidential information.

352
00:38:28,284 --> 00:38:29,718
That the captured drug shipment

353
00:38:29,718 --> 00:38:32,072
will be escorted out of Guatemala tomorrow

354
00:38:32,072 --> 00:38:34,225
by government troops.

355
00:38:34,225 --> 00:38:38,254
I want you to grab that
shipment, do you understand?

356
00:38:38,254 --> 00:38:39,454
- Si, general.

357
00:38:39,454 --> 00:38:42,371
I will prepare the men immediately.

358
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:46,614
The drug shipment that was captured

359
00:38:46,614 --> 00:38:50,249
will be taken out of Guatemala tomorrow.

360
00:38:50,249 --> 00:38:51,603
We will cross the border tonight

361
00:38:51,603 --> 00:38:54,436
and wait in ambush for the convoy.

362
00:38:56,149 --> 00:38:59,548
Assemble the men, we move out at once.

363
00:38:59,548 --> 00:39:02,325
(speaking in foreign language)

364
00:39:02,325 --> 00:39:06,408
(suspenseful instrumental music)

365
00:39:14,666 --> 00:39:15,499
- Hold it!

366
00:39:17,427 --> 00:39:19,216
What are you doing here?

367
00:39:19,216 --> 00:39:20,510
This is a restricted area!

368
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,303
- [Ray] I was just checking the roof.

369
00:39:22,303 --> 00:39:25,720
(scuffling and grunting)

370
00:39:52,343 --> 00:39:53,176
- Hey!

371
00:39:53,176 --> 00:39:54,928
(gun firing)

372
00:39:54,928 --> 00:39:59,011
(suspenseful instrumental music)

373
00:40:24,934 --> 00:40:26,684
- [Soldier] Let's go.

374
00:40:42,893 --> 00:40:43,726
- I see him!

375
00:40:43,726 --> 00:40:44,643
Down there!

376
00:40:51,721 --> 00:40:53,388
Shit, go over there.

377
00:41:31,371 --> 00:41:33,871
(guns firing)

378
00:42:35,003 --> 00:42:38,920
(foreboding suspenseful music)

379
00:43:19,882 --> 00:43:22,965
(upbeat piano music)

380
00:43:46,434 --> 00:43:50,351
(foreboding suspenseful music)

381
00:44:32,517 --> 00:44:34,265
(phone ringing)

382
00:44:34,265 --> 00:44:36,152
- Colonel Bermudez.

383
00:44:36,152 --> 00:44:37,568
(speaking in foreign language)

384
00:44:37,568 --> 00:44:38,401
- How can you know

385
00:44:38,401 --> 00:44:40,438
when you've not informed
me of your hiring!

386
00:44:40,438 --> 00:44:41,513
You know how particular I am

387
00:44:41,513 --> 00:44:44,599
when it comes to personnel
and sensitive positions.

388
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:46,016
They can ruin us!

389
00:44:47,461 --> 00:44:49,828
Shut up and listen to me.

390
00:44:49,828 --> 00:44:53,082
You find that black sergeant
and bring him to me.

391
00:44:53,082 --> 00:44:55,442
I will make him talk personally.

392
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:57,009
Do you understand?

393
00:44:57,009 --> 00:44:58,176
- Si, general.

394
00:44:59,221 --> 00:45:01,946
- I want Cobra terminated immediately.

395
00:45:01,946 --> 00:45:04,440
Before that black sergeant can get to him.

396
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,352
Do I make myself clear?

397
00:45:06,352 --> 00:45:08,289
- Si, general, si.

398
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:09,645
- Now go!

399
00:45:09,645 --> 00:45:10,812
- Si, general.

400
00:45:12,871 --> 00:45:13,704
Rodriguez.

401
00:45:13,704 --> 00:45:14,774
- Sir!

402
00:45:14,774 --> 00:45:16,327
- Sound the alarm.

403
00:45:16,327 --> 00:45:19,234
That black sergeant is an imposter.

404
00:45:19,234 --> 00:45:20,849
Get him.

405
00:45:20,849 --> 00:45:22,182
- With pleasure.

406
00:45:25,088 --> 00:45:29,255
- I will attend to the
execution of Cobra personally.

407
00:45:30,208 --> 00:45:34,208
(foreboding instrumental music)

408
00:46:10,873 --> 00:46:13,123
(laughing)

409
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:05,696
(shouting)

410
00:47:28,232 --> 00:47:32,315
(suspenseful instrumental music)

411
00:48:23,268 --> 00:48:25,213
- This guard duty really stinks, you know.

412
00:48:25,213 --> 00:48:26,492
- Yeah, you're right.

413
00:48:26,492 --> 00:48:28,304
- Hey guys, got a light?

414
00:48:28,304 --> 00:48:29,554
- [Guard] Sure.

415
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,713
- Is that a motor pull over there?

416
00:48:38,713 --> 00:48:42,130
(scuffling and grunting)

417
00:49:26,383 --> 00:49:28,911
- Run!
- Thanks buddy.

418
00:49:28,911 --> 00:49:32,828
(speaking in foreign language)

419
00:49:38,322 --> 00:49:42,322
(foreboding instrumental music)

420
00:50:43,544 --> 00:50:44,895
- Hold it, senor.

421
00:50:44,895 --> 00:50:47,062
This is a restricted area.

422
00:50:49,384 --> 00:50:52,387
- Something's wrong with my pistol, see?

423
00:50:52,387 --> 00:50:55,137
(dramatic music)

424
00:51:38,248 --> 00:51:39,630
- [Guard] Hold it right there!

425
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:40,463
Get up.

426
00:51:42,635 --> 00:51:45,841
(scuffling and grunting)

427
00:51:45,841 --> 00:51:47,341
- [Guard] Drop it.

428
00:51:52,544 --> 00:51:53,864
- Mark, get down!

429
00:51:53,864 --> 00:51:56,281
(gun firing)

430
00:52:00,169 --> 00:52:02,669
(guns firing)

431
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:07,947
When I heard accommodation was bad,

432
00:52:07,947 --> 00:52:09,802
I decided to pay you a visit.

433
00:52:09,802 --> 00:52:11,369
- You're a little late, pal.

434
00:52:11,369 --> 00:52:13,436
I already checked out, let's go.

435
00:52:13,436 --> 00:52:14,996
- Okay, I got a truck waiting outside

436
00:52:14,996 --> 00:52:17,829
so let's get the fuck out of here.

437
00:52:23,065 --> 00:52:23,920
- What's happening here?

438
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,704
- Sir, the prisoner has escaped!

439
00:52:25,704 --> 00:52:27,076
(speaking in foreign language)

440
00:52:27,076 --> 00:52:28,124
- Search the grounds!

441
00:52:28,124 --> 00:52:29,707
After them, pronto!

442
00:52:36,293 --> 00:52:38,793
(guns firing)

443
00:52:44,503 --> 00:52:47,294
Cut them off at the perimeter wall.

444
00:52:47,294 --> 00:52:51,377
(suspenseful instrumental music)

445
00:53:13,651 --> 00:53:15,591
- [Ray] Hey Mark, I
got it all set up here.

446
00:53:15,591 --> 00:53:16,424
We're going down here.
- You really

447
00:53:16,424 --> 00:53:18,819
took care of everything.

448
00:53:18,819 --> 00:53:21,986
- [Ray] Okay go ahead, I'll cover you.

449
00:53:29,629 --> 00:53:32,129
(guns firing)

450
00:53:47,082 --> 00:53:48,088
You okay?

451
00:53:48,088 --> 00:53:49,588
Come on, let's go.

452
00:54:03,492 --> 00:54:06,203
(gun firing)

453
00:54:06,203 --> 00:54:07,641
And I got something for you, partner.

454
00:54:07,641 --> 00:54:08,556
Here.

455
00:54:08,556 --> 00:54:10,036
I got the rest in the back of this truck.

456
00:54:10,036 --> 00:54:10,869
Let's go!

457
00:54:10,869 --> 00:54:12,702
Let's move it come on.

458
00:54:23,692 --> 00:54:27,609
(speaking in foreign language)

459
00:54:38,769 --> 00:54:40,186
- Leave us alone.

460
00:54:44,882 --> 00:54:46,975
I've got news for you.

461
00:54:46,975 --> 00:54:49,475
Your brother has just escaped.

462
00:54:50,608 --> 00:54:52,590
But not for long.

463
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:54,992
He will be recaptured

464
00:54:54,992 --> 00:54:58,159
because my dear, you will be the bait.

465
00:55:01,018 --> 00:55:04,186
Unless you want to make me happy.

466
00:55:04,186 --> 00:55:08,186
Then you and your brother
will go free, promise.

467
00:55:13,951 --> 00:55:16,591
You will both crawl like
snakes under my feet,

468
00:55:16,591 --> 00:55:19,924
I promise you that on my parents' grave!

469
00:55:26,958 --> 00:55:28,541
- [Man] Stop, stop!

470
00:55:30,045 --> 00:55:30,878
Stop!

471
00:55:35,876 --> 00:55:37,739
Oh please, you gotta help us!

472
00:55:37,739 --> 00:55:39,246
- Mark, we gotta go now!

473
00:55:39,246 --> 00:55:40,651
- Please help us!
- We ain't got time!

474
00:55:40,651 --> 00:55:41,888
- Hold it.

475
00:55:41,888 --> 00:55:42,721
Get in the truck.

476
00:55:42,721 --> 00:55:43,737
- Oh thank you.
- What?

477
00:55:43,737 --> 00:55:45,320
- Come on let's go.

478
00:55:46,241 --> 00:55:50,444
- This is the second time
you failed, Commandante.

479
00:55:50,444 --> 00:55:53,588
However I'll give you one more chance.

480
00:55:53,588 --> 00:55:54,889
If you fail to catch them

481
00:55:54,889 --> 00:55:58,806
it's the end of your
career, do you understand?

482
00:56:07,509 --> 00:56:11,176
- How could you let
them slip through hands?

483
00:56:14,739 --> 00:56:17,934
Now I have to answer
for your incompetence.

484
00:56:17,934 --> 00:56:19,669
- We'll soon get them, sir.

485
00:56:19,669 --> 00:56:22,104
We've got the choppers.

486
00:56:22,104 --> 00:56:25,498
- Well you better, for your sake.

487
00:56:25,498 --> 00:56:27,528
Now call airbase.

488
00:56:27,528 --> 00:56:29,028
- Si, Commandante.

489
00:56:57,621 --> 00:56:59,300
- Look, up there, chopper!

490
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:03,383
(suspenseful instrumental music)

491
00:57:05,152 --> 00:57:07,652
- Damn.
- We got to find cover!

492
00:57:11,718 --> 00:57:14,468
(rockets firing)

493
00:57:43,933 --> 00:57:45,674
- Get out of the truck.

494
00:57:45,674 --> 00:57:46,507
Come on.

495
00:57:55,277 --> 00:57:56,653
Move it.

496
00:57:56,653 --> 00:57:57,570
- Go ahead.

497
00:58:07,566 --> 00:58:10,316
(rockets firing)

498
00:58:21,451 --> 00:58:24,201
(rockets firing)

499
00:59:02,341 --> 00:59:03,843
I say.

500
00:59:03,843 --> 00:59:06,848
Guatemala's two or three
days away from here.

501
00:59:06,848 --> 00:59:09,654
Now, if you keep on the right direction

502
00:59:09,654 --> 00:59:11,571
we can make it on time.

503
00:59:12,803 --> 00:59:14,024
- I'm sorry, Ray.

504
00:59:14,024 --> 00:59:15,487
You just have to go on without me.

505
00:59:15,487 --> 00:59:17,135
- What?

506
00:59:17,135 --> 00:59:19,792
- I've still got some
unfinished business later on.

507
00:59:19,792 --> 00:59:21,579
- Business shit!

508
00:59:21,579 --> 00:59:22,979
Business?

509
00:59:22,979 --> 00:59:25,178
This is fucking suicide.

510
00:59:25,178 --> 00:59:27,411
Ortega's gonna eat you
alive when you get there!

511
00:59:27,411 --> 00:59:30,747
- That son of a bitch killed my family!

512
00:59:30,747 --> 00:59:32,159
- Okay.

513
00:59:32,159 --> 00:59:33,980
I'm gonna make a deal with you,

514
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:35,629
when we get to guatemala--

515
00:59:35,629 --> 00:59:37,097
- No deal!

516
00:59:37,097 --> 00:59:39,499
- What do you wanna do,
take a whole fucking army?

517
00:59:39,499 --> 00:59:40,332
- Hold it.

518
00:59:41,208 --> 00:59:43,786
I've got to finish my
fucking business with Ortega.

519
00:59:43,786 --> 00:59:46,848
Only then I can find peace.

520
00:59:46,848 --> 00:59:48,022
- You son of a bitch.

521
00:59:48,022 --> 00:59:50,105
You crazy son of a bitch!

522
00:59:51,183 --> 00:59:52,772
- That's quite alright.

523
00:59:52,772 --> 00:59:55,765
I've already made up my mind.

524
00:59:55,765 --> 00:59:59,631
- Listen, if you think
you can make it out there,

525
00:59:59,631 --> 01:00:01,299
I doubt it, go ahead,

526
01:00:01,299 --> 01:00:02,846
go ahead and get stuck.

527
01:00:02,846 --> 01:00:05,587
Don't expect me to bail you out again,

528
01:00:05,587 --> 01:00:06,580
because I'm not!

529
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:09,080
And believe me, I'm not gonna.

530
01:00:13,077 --> 01:00:15,680
(speaking in foreign language)

531
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,692
- You did something right.

532
01:00:17,692 --> 01:00:19,257
Finally.

533
01:00:19,257 --> 01:00:20,745
Are you sure they were both in the truck

534
01:00:20,745 --> 01:00:23,181
when the chopper blasted them?

535
01:00:23,181 --> 01:00:26,764
(gentle suspenseful music)

536
01:00:29,944 --> 01:00:33,075
Very good, Commandante, very good.

537
01:00:33,075 --> 01:00:36,637
I'm once again overjoyed
to have you in my command.

538
01:00:36,637 --> 01:00:38,965
I'm sorry for misjudging you.

539
01:00:38,965 --> 01:00:40,882
Goodnight, Commandante.

540
01:01:12,533 --> 01:01:15,964
Looks like I won't have
to use you anymore.

541
01:01:15,964 --> 01:01:17,631
Your brother's dead.

542
01:01:19,147 --> 01:01:20,944
You better believe it.

543
01:01:20,944 --> 01:01:21,777
Dead.

544
01:01:43,787 --> 01:01:46,418
(suspenseful music)

545
01:01:46,418 --> 01:01:48,668
- Say your prayers, Ortega.

546
01:01:51,267 --> 01:01:52,100
- No.

547
01:01:53,388 --> 01:01:55,569
It's you who will say your prayers,

548
01:01:55,569 --> 01:01:58,052
or you both will die.

549
01:01:58,052 --> 01:01:59,552
Now drop your gun.

550
01:02:15,363 --> 01:02:19,280
(speaking in foreign language)

551
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:25,783
What a wonderful reunion.

552
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:29,049
Soon the two you will be reunited

553
01:02:29,049 --> 01:02:29,882
in death.

554
01:02:30,928 --> 01:02:31,880
- You know that kind of talk's

555
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,547
bad for your health?

556
01:02:34,975 --> 01:02:38,717
And this is for all the
trouble you've been giving.

557
01:02:38,717 --> 01:02:40,342
- Well done, Ray.

558
01:02:40,342 --> 01:02:41,175
Alright?

559
01:02:42,345 --> 01:02:43,178
Get down!

560
01:02:44,046 --> 01:02:46,463
(gun firing)

561
01:02:52,802 --> 01:02:55,189
- Come on Mark, this way.

562
01:02:55,189 --> 01:02:56,420
Come on, let's move it.

563
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:58,753
- Come on, we're going home.

564
01:03:08,862 --> 01:03:11,676
Carol, everything's okay.

565
01:03:11,676 --> 01:03:12,509
Right?

566
01:03:16,224 --> 01:03:18,142
Thank you, Ray.

567
01:03:18,142 --> 01:03:18,975
- Hey.

568
01:03:19,970 --> 01:03:21,199
So let's get out of this hellhole

569
01:03:21,199 --> 01:03:23,866
and head on back for the border.

570
01:03:24,897 --> 01:03:26,647
- No, no Ray I can't.

571
01:03:28,829 --> 01:03:33,245
I won't be able to live
with myself if I run away.

572
01:03:33,245 --> 01:03:35,828
You go and take Carol with you.

573
01:03:39,512 --> 01:03:42,713
- Man, you're really
something else, you know.

574
01:03:42,713 --> 01:03:45,179
Okay, promise me one thing though,

575
01:03:45,179 --> 01:03:47,106
you take care of yourself, okay?

576
01:03:47,106 --> 01:03:47,939
- Sure.

577
01:03:48,855 --> 01:03:49,688
I promise.

578
01:03:52,958 --> 01:03:56,541
- Take it easy, I'll
take good care of her.

579
01:03:59,278 --> 01:04:02,565
- How dare you give me false information.

580
01:04:02,565 --> 01:04:04,016
Can the dead do this?

581
01:04:04,016 --> 01:04:05,733
- Look me general, the pilot reported--

582
01:04:05,733 --> 01:04:06,566
- Enough.

583
01:04:06,566 --> 01:04:09,479
I don't want to hear
anymore of your excuses.

584
01:04:09,479 --> 01:04:10,911
I want you to find them.

585
01:04:10,911 --> 01:04:14,187
Even if you have to cross
the border, I don't care.

586
01:04:14,187 --> 01:04:15,520
Bring them back.

587
01:04:18,454 --> 01:04:20,035
I've never seen such incompetence

588
01:04:20,035 --> 01:04:22,159
in my entire career.

589
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:24,689
You two are the worst.

590
01:04:24,689 --> 01:04:26,119
- [Soldier] Pardon, me general.

591
01:04:26,119 --> 01:04:27,388
Don Cordoco wishes to request

592
01:04:27,388 --> 01:04:29,369
an audience with you.

593
01:04:29,369 --> 01:04:30,884
- Tell him I'll see
him in the living room.

594
01:04:30,884 --> 01:04:32,738
- [Soldier] Si, me general.

595
01:04:32,738 --> 01:04:34,910
- As for you two,

596
01:04:34,910 --> 01:04:37,090
don't come back without them.

597
01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:37,996
Now go.

598
01:04:37,996 --> 01:04:39,163
- Si, general.

599
01:04:43,489 --> 01:04:45,552
- Hello, Ray here.

600
01:04:45,552 --> 01:04:47,789
No he ain't here.

601
01:04:47,789 --> 01:04:49,777
Let me explain.

602
01:04:49,777 --> 01:04:51,640
Now he refused to come here

603
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:54,492
not unless he settles
his score with Ortega.

604
01:04:54,492 --> 01:04:55,392
That's what I'm trying to tell you,

605
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:57,885
he's doing a little Rambo back there.

606
01:04:57,885 --> 01:04:58,954
Okay.

607
01:04:58,954 --> 01:04:59,787
You copy?

608
01:04:59,787 --> 01:05:00,620
Okay.

609
01:05:01,890 --> 01:05:03,043
Okay, we'll do that.

610
01:05:03,043 --> 01:05:03,876
Okay bye.

611
01:05:06,093 --> 01:05:07,632
Listen.

612
01:05:07,632 --> 01:05:08,819
- What'd he say?

613
01:05:08,819 --> 01:05:09,963
- We gotta meet this guy

614
01:05:09,963 --> 01:05:12,684
in Magumbo Hotel right over the corner.

615
01:05:12,684 --> 01:05:15,433
And we got a little over
10 minutes to make it.

616
01:05:15,433 --> 01:05:16,289
- 10 minutes?

617
01:05:16,289 --> 01:05:17,872
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

618
01:05:19,727 --> 01:05:21,667
Mark and I grew up separately.

619
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:25,396
You know, parents divorced, one kid each.

620
01:05:25,396 --> 01:05:28,637
But I've always had a
brother when I needed one.

621
01:05:28,637 --> 01:05:29,470
- Yeah.

622
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:31,248
He's always talked about having a sister

623
01:05:31,248 --> 01:05:32,748
who's a smart ass.

624
01:05:34,041 --> 01:05:35,071
You know what,

625
01:05:35,071 --> 01:05:37,495
you're lucky to have a brother like Mark.

626
01:05:37,495 --> 01:05:39,245
(door knocking)

627
01:05:39,245 --> 01:05:40,078
Bathroom.

628
01:05:41,697 --> 01:05:42,697
Who's there?

629
01:05:44,073 --> 01:05:45,305
Who's there?

630
01:05:45,305 --> 01:05:46,991
- [Man] Chief Brent sent us.

631
01:05:46,991 --> 01:05:48,305
- Say what?

632
01:05:48,305 --> 01:05:50,595
- [Man] Chief Brent sent us.

633
01:05:50,595 --> 01:05:52,095
- It's about time.

634
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:54,157
- Freeze.

635
01:05:54,157 --> 01:05:55,890
Where's the girl?

636
01:05:55,890 --> 01:05:57,473
- You mean my wife?

637
01:05:58,352 --> 01:05:59,456
- Where's Carol?

638
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:00,456
- Oh, Carol.

639
01:06:01,675 --> 01:06:04,600
Honey, the milkman is here.

640
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:06,532
- [Carol] Okay, send him in.

641
01:06:06,532 --> 01:06:09,451
- Go get her, she's in the shower.

642
01:06:09,451 --> 01:06:10,499
- Hey come on, guys.

643
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:11,332
- Shut up!

644
01:06:13,088 --> 01:06:14,725
(glass breaking)

645
01:06:14,725 --> 01:06:16,975
(grunting)

646
01:06:25,285 --> 01:06:27,702
(gun firing)

647
01:06:35,555 --> 01:06:36,454
- [Ray] It's me.

648
01:06:36,454 --> 01:06:37,954
Let's go, come on.

649
01:06:46,872 --> 01:06:50,955
(suspenseful instrumental music)

650
01:07:01,755 --> 01:07:03,063
Holy shit, watch out!

651
01:07:03,063 --> 01:07:05,563
(guns firing)

652
01:07:26,887 --> 01:07:28,220
Go, fire escape.

653
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:30,853
Go on.

654
01:07:46,921 --> 01:07:49,338
(gun firing)

655
01:08:41,179 --> 01:08:42,039
- What now?

656
01:08:42,039 --> 01:08:43,122
- [Ray] Well.

657
01:08:44,230 --> 01:08:45,647
We're going down.

658
01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:20,030
(suspenseful music)

659
01:09:32,244 --> 01:09:33,467
- Where's Ortega?

660
01:09:33,467 --> 01:09:35,571
- In his palace.

661
01:09:35,571 --> 01:09:37,256
- No he's not.

662
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:38,919
Tell me or I'll break your neck.

663
01:09:38,919 --> 01:09:40,169
- I don't know.

664
01:09:42,450 --> 01:09:43,617
- Where is he?

665
01:10:30,791 --> 01:10:34,961
For the last time
Rodriguez, where's Ortega?

666
01:10:34,961 --> 01:10:38,683
- Yankee, even if I know
I wouldn't tell you.

667
01:10:38,683 --> 01:10:40,766
You're wasting your time.

668
01:10:42,353 --> 01:10:43,520
- Fair enough.

669
01:11:06,794 --> 01:11:08,152
- Hey!

670
01:11:08,152 --> 01:11:09,983
What're you doing?

671
01:11:09,983 --> 01:11:12,226
No, you crazy Yankee.

672
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:13,059
No!

673
01:11:32,001 --> 01:11:33,821
- If you know what's good for you,

674
01:11:33,821 --> 01:11:35,632
where's Ortega?

675
01:11:35,632 --> 01:11:36,733
- Alright.

676
01:11:36,733 --> 01:11:37,566
Alright.

677
01:11:38,879 --> 01:11:40,334
He's at the rancho.

678
01:11:40,334 --> 01:11:42,493
A few kilometers from here.

679
01:11:42,493 --> 01:11:43,410
- Good boy.

680
01:11:48,291 --> 01:11:49,124
- Hey!

681
01:11:51,014 --> 01:11:52,538
Where are you going?

682
01:11:52,538 --> 01:11:54,730
Don't leave me here!

683
01:11:54,730 --> 01:11:55,563
Hey,

684
01:11:56,778 --> 01:11:58,059
hey!

685
01:11:58,059 --> 01:11:59,809
You could get robbed!

686
01:12:03,481 --> 01:12:05,248
- We now have a decision

687
01:12:05,248 --> 01:12:07,908
on your request Mr. Davis.

688
01:12:07,908 --> 01:12:09,277
We are willing to look after your friend's

689
01:12:09,277 --> 01:12:12,366
daughter while you're here in Guatemala.

690
01:12:12,366 --> 01:12:13,903
- I'm most grateful father.

691
01:12:13,903 --> 01:12:15,190
I know that this is the only place

692
01:12:15,190 --> 01:12:17,862
that she will be in safe hands.

693
01:12:17,862 --> 01:12:22,029
Carol, baby, please don't
ever ever leave this place.

694
01:12:22,912 --> 01:12:26,195
Wolves in sheep's clothing
abound in the city.

695
01:12:26,195 --> 01:12:28,439
If you know what I mean.

696
01:12:28,439 --> 01:12:32,522
- Surely, you watch out
for those wolves, too.

697
01:12:32,522 --> 01:12:36,014
- Well Father, thank you very much, sir.

698
01:12:36,014 --> 01:12:38,924
Please take good care of her.

699
01:12:38,924 --> 01:12:40,016
Bye, my dear.

700
01:12:40,016 --> 01:12:41,279
You will be okay.

701
01:12:41,279 --> 01:12:43,743
- Please come right this way, my child.

702
01:12:43,743 --> 01:12:44,576
- Okay.

703
01:12:51,241 --> 01:12:54,971
- I don't know how they
got wind of this hotel.

704
01:12:54,971 --> 01:12:56,118
Now how sure are you that there's

705
01:12:56,118 --> 01:12:58,785
no leakage in your organization?

706
01:13:02,174 --> 01:13:05,282
We almost got our ass
racked down here, man.

707
01:13:05,282 --> 01:13:06,115
Say what?

708
01:13:09,019 --> 01:13:10,981
Okay okay okay.

709
01:13:10,981 --> 01:13:12,795
I'll be careful.

710
01:13:12,795 --> 01:13:14,292
Where?

711
01:13:14,292 --> 01:13:15,125
What time?

712
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:18,093
Okay, we'll be there.

713
01:13:18,093 --> 01:13:19,287
We'll meet you.

714
01:13:19,287 --> 01:13:20,531
Okay, bye.

715
01:13:20,531 --> 01:13:21,364
Fuck.

716
01:13:31,627 --> 01:13:35,544
(foreboding suspenseful music)

717
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:18,817
(train whistling and chugging)

718
01:14:40,357 --> 01:14:44,440
(suspenseful instrumental music)

719
01:15:31,819 --> 01:15:34,319
(guns firing)

720
01:15:51,357 --> 01:15:53,857
(guns firing)

721
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:16,997
(gun firing)

722
01:16:46,251 --> 01:16:50,001
(dramatic suspenseful music)

723
01:16:56,146 --> 01:16:58,646
(guns firing)

724
01:17:21,418 --> 01:17:24,168
(bomb exploding)

725
01:17:43,073 --> 01:17:45,906
(bombs exploding)

726
01:17:49,109 --> 01:17:51,609
(guns firing)

727
01:17:52,804 --> 01:17:53,804
- After him!

728
01:17:54,811 --> 01:17:56,311
Bermudez, with me.

729
01:18:03,788 --> 01:18:06,288
(guns firing)

730
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:39,153
(bombs exploding)

731
01:18:46,621 --> 01:18:49,121
(guns firing)

732
01:19:11,138 --> 01:19:14,138
(grenade exploding)

733
01:19:18,736 --> 01:19:21,153
(gun firing)

734
01:19:34,252 --> 01:19:38,335
(suspenseful instrumental music)

735
01:19:50,388 --> 01:19:52,888
(guns firing)

736
01:20:38,644 --> 01:20:41,061
(gun firing)

737
01:20:42,302 --> 01:20:43,633
- I think I got him.

738
01:20:43,633 --> 01:20:45,597
- Make sure he's dead.

739
01:20:45,597 --> 01:20:49,347
(dramatic suspenseful music)

740
01:21:01,302 --> 01:21:03,802
(guns firing)

741
01:21:43,962 --> 01:21:48,045
(suspenseful instrumental music)

742
01:22:01,032 --> 01:22:03,449
(gun firing)

743
01:22:08,585 --> 01:22:11,002
(gun firing)

744
01:23:09,047 --> 01:23:12,380
(somber dramatic music)

745
01:23:34,022 --> 01:23:35,810
- Oh, Mark, Ray.

746
01:23:35,810 --> 01:23:37,560
Come on, have a seat.

747
01:23:40,127 --> 01:23:42,377
What's the meaning of this?

748
01:23:44,332 --> 01:23:47,499
(soft dramatic music)

749
01:23:54,864 --> 01:23:56,642
- You betrayed us.

750
01:23:56,642 --> 01:23:59,500
You sold your soul, for what?

751
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:01,054
For money?

752
01:24:01,054 --> 01:24:03,441
- Look, you don't understand,

753
01:24:03,441 --> 01:24:04,950
they forced me to do it,

754
01:24:04,950 --> 01:24:07,466
there was nothing I could do, believe me.

755
01:24:07,466 --> 01:24:08,299
- God.

756
01:24:08,299 --> 01:24:09,739
- Look at this way, they threatened

757
01:24:09,739 --> 01:24:11,358
to show it to my family, you know.

758
01:24:11,358 --> 01:24:13,326
I can't let that happen.

759
01:24:13,326 --> 01:24:15,599
- It ain't no reason to murder people.

760
01:24:15,599 --> 01:24:18,306
So we'll start with murder
one, how's about that?

761
01:24:18,306 --> 01:24:19,306
Hey partner?

762
01:24:20,235 --> 01:24:22,465
- Look, I'm sorry.

763
01:24:22,465 --> 01:24:25,146
I'll make it up to you, I promise.

764
01:24:25,146 --> 01:24:27,119
What do you want, money?

765
01:24:27,119 --> 01:24:28,119
One million?

766
01:24:29,203 --> 01:24:31,005
Five million?

767
01:24:31,005 --> 01:24:34,184
I've got it, all you've
got to do is take it

768
01:24:34,184 --> 01:24:36,996
and don't tell anyone about my weakness.

769
01:24:36,996 --> 01:24:39,079
They'll never forgive me.

770
01:24:49,984 --> 01:24:51,033
- You know what,

771
01:24:51,033 --> 01:24:55,033
I've been waiting for
this for a long long time.

772
01:24:56,041 --> 01:24:56,874
Take him.

773
01:25:10,897 --> 01:25:12,613
Five million dollars.

774
01:25:12,613 --> 01:25:15,168
That's 30 years of work.

775
01:25:15,168 --> 01:25:17,953
Just kidding, come on let's have a beer.

776
01:25:17,953 --> 01:25:18,786
Come on.

777
01:25:28,888 --> 01:25:29,721
- Father.

778
01:25:31,568 --> 01:25:32,798
How are you?

779
01:25:32,798 --> 01:25:35,407
Now I'd like you to
meet Mr. Mark Mitchell.

780
01:25:35,407 --> 01:25:37,352
- [Mark] How are you, Father?

781
01:25:37,352 --> 01:25:38,185
- Be seated.

782
01:25:38,185 --> 01:25:40,602
- Thank you.
- I'll fetch her.

783
01:25:45,649 --> 01:25:47,840
- What's taking her so long?

784
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:51,565
- Just relax, you know how women are.

785
01:25:51,565 --> 01:25:54,565
They love this powder and that shit.

786
01:25:56,141 --> 01:25:57,391
- Mark?
- Carol.

787
01:26:04,489 --> 01:26:05,322
Are you okay?

788
01:26:05,322 --> 01:26:06,580
- Yeah.

789
01:26:06,580 --> 01:26:08,053
Thanks to everyone.

790
01:26:08,053 --> 01:26:10,444
- [Mark] I'm so happy to see you.

791
01:26:10,444 --> 01:26:11,944
Thank you, Father.

792
01:26:19,869 --> 01:26:23,202
(upbeat dramatic music)
