to understand

is that nothing goes to waste.

to feed human beings.

But without animals,
these people cannot live.

vegetables up here,

it will be rotten in two days
in the sun.

So, they only way then can
actually feed themselves

911
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:20,520
is by actually making
the animals walk with them.

from the bottom to the top,

1006
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:41,760

thinking, I go...

1040
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:09,280
Yep, base camp.

to making the first step.

Yeah, if we strong enough,

1060
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:21,440
then make possible, yeah?

1061
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:23,560
Yeah, it's the summit.

1062
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:25,360
There is no summit. [LAUGHS]

1063
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:27,840
I don't know.

1064
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:32,680
Me, yesterday,
I was very tired.

1065
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:35,840
And I don't know
if I have the power

1066
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:38,360
to make the trek till there.

1067
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:41,480
And if I have the power, after,
I don't know the next day,

1068
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:43,520
to the top.

1069
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:47,360
I think the chance is quite...

1070
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:49,600
Small.

1071
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,920
Thick snow... [PANTING]

1072
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:05,120
Strong winds made us
turn around.

1073
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:12,840
Unfortunately,

1074
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:15,480
it didn't work out
like I wanted it
to work out.

1075
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:18,480
But, um, we're all alive.

1076
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:21,200
We can all try again.

1077
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:26,760
This year K2 didn't open
its doors and windows
for us to get through.

1078
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:28,200
But such is life.

1079
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:30,480
If you don't try,
you'll never know.

1080
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:42,560
MIKE: How can you
discover new land

1081
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:46,440
if you never leave home?

1082
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:49,960
To learn, you have to step
out of your comfort zone.

1083
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:01,560
This way.

1084
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:06,760
Now, we really stuck.

1085
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:09,200
The machine...
Can't go back.

1086
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,840
Kobi is trying to
dive into the water

1087
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:48,560
without going too deep,
because he says there's
rocks underneath it.

1088
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:49,880
So, he wants to go "flop".

1089
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:13,720
[LAUGHTER]

1090
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:34,800
[PANTING]
