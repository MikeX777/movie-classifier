1
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,770
FOEGI IS A BASTARD

2
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,000
Excuse me, please let me through.

3
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,710
His pulse is weak.
Hurry up.

4
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,600
Can you hear me?

5
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,100
Answer me!

6
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:19,370
I was instantly attracted to him.
His music totally fascinated me.

7
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:24,300
When I heard him on the radio for the first time,
I couldn't believe that this was a Swiss group.

8
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,100
And when I saw him, I instantly understood.
Foegi was a star.

9
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,000
I had never seen anyone like him.

10
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,150
And to imagine that one day I would be so close to him.

11
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,700
The Doors.

12
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,700
Cat Stevens.

13
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,400
Van Morrison.

14
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,000
Bob Dillon.

15
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,400
Velvet Underground.

16
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,400
Neil Diamond.

17
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,930
Really, Reto, you're so out of line.

18
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,130
Why that?

19
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,930
- That guy gives me the creeps.
- That's a matter of taste.

20
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,230
Exactly this is your problem: no taste.

21
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,920
And Van Morrison?

22
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,820
Between Van Morrison and Neil Diamond
there's a world of difference.

23
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,170
There's no way to compare the two.

24
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:17,120
Instead of reading teen magazines
you'd better smoke a joint.

25
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,410
There's Schaefer.

26
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,460
Okay, let's go!

27
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,880
Instead of messing with everything, you could help me.

28
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,390
Wind up the cables, for example.

29
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,700
I was not that good at winding up cables,

30
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,270
but they took me along to their concert in Basle as a roadie.

31
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:30,370
Has anyone brought something to drink?
Isn't there anything to drink?

32
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,360
I don't believe it!
It's stifling hot

33
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,760
and there's nothing to drink!

34
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,960
- Is this supposed to be a joke?
- What, the hat?

35
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,900
- Well, it's cute.
- Marc Bolan!

36
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,710
Marc Bolan?
It's more like the Queen of England.

37
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,200
Hey, Waede, music!

38
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,690
I have to rewind the tape first.

39
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:56,600
Wait, take this tape.

40
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,170
- It's CCR.
- American pop shit.

41
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:03,760
Not American pop!
Hey, give the tape to me.

42
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,100
Do you know how late it is?

43
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,300
- 3:15 am.
- Three in the morning. Where have you been?

44
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,700
- In Basle.
- In Basle?

45
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,700
Are you kidding me?

46
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:04,400
Do you think I'd accept that my son travels to Basle just like that?

47
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,200
Listen!
You're living under my roof.

48
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,300
I have a right to know where you spend the whole night.

49
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,800
- Anything else you have to say?
- Yes, you bet I have!

50
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,900
I didn't sleep one second the whole night.

51
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,800
Fritz left because he was fed up with my worries about you.

52
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,700
And you think it's normal just to disappear and return quietly at 3 am.

53
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,000
Fritz is your friend, not mine.
I don't give a shit about his boat.

54
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,400
We're better off without him.

55
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,200
If it doesn't suit you, I'll move out.
Got it?

56
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,100
You want to go?
May I ask where?

57
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,100
And on what are you going to live?

58
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,800
Dear Foegi,

59
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,700
I don't even know if you know my name.

60
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,500
I've been helping backstage at your concert in Basle.

61
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,500
I didn't dare to speak to you, so I'm writing you now.

62
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,800
I've been following The Minks for a long time.
I see all your concerts and think you're an amazing singer.

63
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,400
But I'm no ordinary fan like the others.
I admire you not only because you're famous.

64
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,300
You create your own music without bothering what others think.

65
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,700
I heard you're gay, but that's okay for me.
I love you, Beni.

66
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,300
Hello?

67
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,100
One moment.

68
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:21,210
Beni.
For you. Someone named Foegi.

69
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,700
Hello?

70
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,410
It's open!

71
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,500
- Hello.
- Hello.

72
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,720
- Did I wake you up?
- Yes.

73
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,780
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

74
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,100
- Do you always get up so early?
- No, just today.

75
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:29,500
Is there a cigarette left?

76
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,720
Listen, I'm completely wasted.

77
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,720
Lie down here if you want.

78
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,500
- Can I have one?
- Sure.

79
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,490
I didn't smoke at your age.
I was a good boy.

80
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,600
- I just started smoking...
- That's okay. I was just kidding.

81
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,740
I really liked your letter.

82
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,200
- Honestly?
- Yes.

83
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,090
I had never thought you would call me.

84
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,690
- Why not?
- You have so many fans.

85
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,720
- But they are not like you.
- Why?

86
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,800
You said so in your letter.

87
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,900
Yes.

88
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,720
You're beautiful!

89
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,090
I have to go to the toilet.

90
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,300
It's at the left side.

91
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:45,270
- Are you okay?
- I feel dizzy.

92
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,100
It's your breathing.

93
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,790
I see.

94
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:56,050
Too much oxygen in your brain.

95
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:00,180
You breathe like an ox when we fuck.

96
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:05,640
- Must be because I love you.
- Really?

97
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:09,080
Don't laugh.
I'm serious.

98
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:12,000
Yes, Beni.
I know.

99
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,500
He doesn't get it. Listens to The Lords,
Melanie, Neil Diamond, and other bullshit.

100
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:33,100
- You liked the Lords too.
- That's ages ago.

101
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:37,270
- It isn't that long ago.
- It seems so to me.

102
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:41,090
I had never smoked pot yet
and jacked off every night

103
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,880
when I still heard that shit.

104
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:47,870
That's precisely Reto's problem.
He's stuck there and doesn't notice.

105
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,100
Since I met you,
I realized a lot of things.

106
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,200
Come on.
Light that joint.

107
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,020
Oh, sorry.

108
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,160
Hello, Toebe.

109
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,500
Did it work out?

110
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,100
- Yes.
- And the van?

111
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,780
Ritch's brother will lend it to us.

112
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,230
Well, I'll go to the kitchen.

113
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,930
What's with him?

114
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,790
One for Foegi.

115
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,890
A little bit for Toebe,

116
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,510
and one for Beni.

117
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,140
What's that?

118
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,140
Are these trips?

119
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,000
Why didn't you tell me?
I am also interested in this.

120
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,500
Are you?

121
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,200
Have you already taken one?

122
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,000
No, Beni, not yet.

123
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,550
Why not taste one?

124
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,700
No, not today.

125
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,980
- Why not?
- Because...

126
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,600
Because of what?

127
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,200
Because... not now.
Okay?

128
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,300
- But I've never tried one.
- Don't touch it!

129
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:24,400
- I said not now, understood?
- Yeah.

130
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,000
Did you hear about The Alligators?

131
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:38,450
They managed to play the opening act of Eric Burton's tour in Germany.

132
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:41,830
Yeah, we all know about that.
It's because they have a manager

133
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,830
and he gets them all these good gigs.

134
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,700
Of course, that's what such a guy is for.
So where's the problem?

135
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,930
He's right.
What's this paranoia good for?

136
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,300
Music is business.

137
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:57,300
Let's face it.
We can't keep asking my brother for the car forever.

138
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:01,200
One day he will say: "That's it, boys!
Unload the car and get lost!"

139
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,330
- And than it's over for us.
- Here, have a drink.

140
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,460
No thanks. I don't need one.

141
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,220
- Come on!
- No!

142
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,650
Why not?

143
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,300
Because I can't play when I'm drunk.

144
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,800
The Alligators only play when they are completely stoned.

145
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,800
That's their secret. 
Come on!

146
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,200
It will help you to keep things in perspective.

147
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,710
Shit! Look at me.

148
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,690
You spilled it all over me.

149
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,100
What a jerk!

150
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,500
You think it's funny, huh?

151
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,800
Got a cigarette?

152
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,380
Fire?

153
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,010
Did you see the movie with the giant pods?

154
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,400
Body Snatchers.

155
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:00,000
They gobble up your identity,
your feelings.

156
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,160
No, not like that.

157
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,970
You catch the virus the moment you're born.

158
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,550
It grows very slowly.

159
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,700
It depends on the person.
After 30 it get's difficult.

160
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,200
At 40 it's over.
Guys at 40 are the desert.

161
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,200
No more emotions,
they only produce.

162
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,000
No more generosity,

163
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,300
no heart...

164
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,280
Nothing but sacrifices.

165
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,320
A life full of sacrifices.

166
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,860
- What about women?
- Same thing.

167
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:47,100
With a few exceptions,
but for those Valium was invented.

168
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,700
- What about me?
- You? You'll kick the bucket before.

169
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,900
Aren't you sleeping?

170
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,500
Come!

171
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,900
Hey... Toebe!

172
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,400
What is it?

173
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,130
Have you seen Beni?

174
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:37,830
- What? Beni?
- Yes.

175
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,200
I don't know where he is.

176
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,700
Come on, let's go.

177
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,700
- Now?
- Yes.

178
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,880
He's not here.

179
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,850
He'll come.

180
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,500
It's alright, Toebe.

181
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,300
Go to bed.

182
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,770
I'm completely finished.

183
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,900
Is it okay if I sleep here?

184
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,800
Sure.
Get yourself a blanket.

185
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,230
Ah, there you are.

186
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,100
I'm sorry.

187
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,300
Where have you been?

188
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,550
I hitched a ride,
but got stuck in Baden.

189
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,550
There I had to wait for the first train.

190
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,830
Come to bed.

191
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,220
Do you still love me?

192
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,410
Of course I still love you.

193
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,410
You know, Foegi, I'm not like you.

194
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,300
I don't want to be jealous,
but I couldn't stand to see you with him.

195
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,600
I was scared.

196
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,200
And now you aren't scared anymore?

197
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,200
No.

198
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,700
Are you awake?
Is everything okay?

199
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:51,500
In winter, things didn't go well for The Minks.

200
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,300
Ritch was right.
It's hard without a manager.

201
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,400
But Foegi wanted to stay independent.

202
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:01,400
So he resorted to dealing drugs and travelled to Lebanon to buy cheap hashish.

203
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,800
- Hello, Beni.
- How do you do?

204
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,000
Cool, man. Long time here?
We're up there.

205
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,300
No, I just arrived.

206
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:29,600
- Well? Any news from Foegi?
- Yes, he sent me a card.

207
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,000
What's bothering you?

208
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,700
I've gone crazy since he left.

209
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,490
Come on!
It's only two weeks.

210
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,650
I know...

211
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:48,200
But I miss him so much.

212
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:53,700
I'm worried that something might happen,
that he could get caught or something.

213
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:57,300
Don't worry, he is too smart for that.
They'll never catch him.

214
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:01,120
Hey, Beni-freak!
Has Foegi not sent a sample yet?

215
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:02,210
Hello, Ritch.

216
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,700
Listen, Ritch.
Beni isn't feeling too good.

217
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:08,200
If you want to avoid a double suicide, leave us alone.

218
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:05,850
Do you have a light?

219
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:16,150
It's cold, huh?

220
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,950
Haven't I seen you at the Odeon?

221
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:28,210
Yes, I was there.

222
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,750
You kept staring at me.

223
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,050
Yes, that's true.

224
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,830
You were there yesterday too,
and you didn't look so well.

225
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:44,610
- And I saw you twice last week.
- That's possible.

226
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,410
I've been noticing you for a long time.

227
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:57,690
I even dream of you.

228
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,490
Won't you have a drink with me?

229
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
- I just want to go home.
- Only one beer,

230
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,100
or whatever you prefer.

231
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,500
Hello, Beni.

232
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,330
How's life?

233
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,800
I was completely stoned.
All I wanted was to go home.

234
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,300
Then he started talking to me and I went with him.

235
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,600
He gave me 50 francs.

236
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,700
- Are you angry?
- No.

237
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:34,100
I can't stand it when you're not here.
I can't live without you.

238
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,700
If you had been away a little longer,
I don't know what I had done.

239
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,900
What's the matter?

240
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,900
- I understand. You're angry.
- I'm not.

241
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:56,900
You know, in Beirut

242
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,500
I wasn't feeling too good either.

243
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,500
Why?

244
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,500
I realized that I was getting old.

245
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:08,200
Are you crazy?
You're not old at all.

246
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:12,270
I realized that this can't go on much longer.

247
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:18,000
Listen, Foegi.
Tell me clearly if you're fed up with me.

248
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,200
I know I'm not very interesting, but I'd do anything for you.

249
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,500
If you want, I'll get you some super guys.

250
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:29,100
Stop hallucinating.
It has nothing to do with you.

251
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,800
You know that I can't stand old people.

252
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:36,000
They're walking corpses.
I'd rather put an end to it before.

253
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,810
You want to commit suicide, is it that?

254
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:45,100
If you do, I'll do the same.

255
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,800
Come on, Beni, take it easy.

256
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,520
I've bought orange soda.

257
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,500
And cigarettes.

258
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,800
Thanks.

259
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,100
I've bought this too.
It's brand-new and very practical.

260
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,180
You just have to put it in the oven.

261
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,300
What oven?

262
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,780
If you don't feel like it, Ritch,
just say so.

263
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,760
Tell me what to play.
I have no idea what I'm supposed to play.

264
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:17,430
Tell me.
I don't know what you want.

265
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:21,260
You don't know what I want?
What a shame.

266
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:23,620
We've been playing together for so long.

267
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:26,920
So what do you want?

268
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,400
Do you at least know what you want yourself, huh?

269
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,000
Come on, tell us!

270
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,000
You must have a reason for being here.

271
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,500
Or do you just have nothing better to do?

272
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,700
Did you fail to find someone to screw today?

273
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:46,000
Enough, Foegi,
this won't get us anywhere.

274
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,100
I just want to know, that's all.

275
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,300
You're unfair.

276
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,000
Am I?

277
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,800
Do you want me to rub your back?

278
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,100
Foegi!

279
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,250
Do you think Ritch will quit?

280
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,500
You were a little rude,
but you did the right thing.

281
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:50,230
He's been slacking off lately.

282
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:51,800
Really?

283
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,200
Yes.

284
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:58,200
I mean, you didn't go to Lebanon and made all that money to continue as before.

285
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:02,300
Listen, Beni,
stop talking bullshit and leave me alone.

286
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,200
Why?
What did I say this time?

287
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:41,200
We must return to the stage, give concerts.

288
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,010
Then the feeling will come back again.

289
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:47,700
- Leave us alone.
- Then I'll play Pinball.

290
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:48,700
Okay.

291
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:56,200
We are a live band.
You always said so.

292
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,500
The people love our music.
And now that we are loaded...

293
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,100
To hell with the people.

294
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:07,200
Forget it, Toebe.

295
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,300
You can see there's no point in it.

296
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,600
Why drag on with something that's already dead?

297
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,100
- When did you have your relapse?
- That has nothing to do with it.

298
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:24,100
- Are you sure?
- Leave me alone with that.

299
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,100
I'm just fed up.

300
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,100
Foegi.

301
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:39,100
Foegi!

302
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:48,110
You don't love me anymore.
You just don't love me anymore.

303
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:54,080
- Foegi!
- Leave me alone!

304
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,100
Don't be like that.

305
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:00,300
Please.

306
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:10,000
Say something.
What do you want me to do? Tell me!

307
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:12,700
Will you stop that!

308
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,800
Stop it!
Enough of that! Okay!

309
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:20,700
Come on, get out!

310
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,700
Leave me alone!

311
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,400
No!

312
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,100
Do you want coffee?

313
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
No.

314
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,400
Then I don't want either.

315
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,400
Get lost.

316
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,300
Listen, Beni, you're getting on my nerves.

317
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:37,800
But I didn' do anything.

318
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:41,400
You crawl around like a slave.
It's totally nerv-destroying.

319
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,500
The two of us, that was only a fling!

320
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:54,100
Now get out!

321
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:40,700
Can you give me two grams?

322
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:46,500
Got something?

323
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Can I exchange hash for this?

324
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:59,200
100 francs and a piece.

325
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:30,500
How much longer do you plan to play the dog?

326
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,100
Eat!

327
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,300
"Eat", I said!

328
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,200
- Can I order another one?
- Go ahead.

329
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,700
And tell them to bring me a beer.

330
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:08,400
And cigarettes.

331
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:14,200
Hello, Beni, how are you?
Do you have a little time?

332
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:17,200
- No, I'm here with a friend.
- I see.

333
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:35,100
- Who is that?
- Wirsling.

334
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:36,100
Who?

335
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:39,500
- The guy who picked me up when you were in Lebanon.
- And what did he want?

336
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,700
He asked if I had time.

337
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:13,500
Hi!

338
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:15,300
Hello.

339
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,200
Am Foegi, a friend of Beni.

340
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:21,200
- Can I take a seat?
- Sure.

341
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:30,300
- Beni told me you're a psychiatrist.
- Right.

342
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,000
That must be interesting.

343
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,300
Sometimes it is.

344
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:40,700
Cold showers, electric shocks,
that sounds attractive.

345
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:44,200
- The methods have changed a bit lately.
- Is that so?

346
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:49,100
- Never heard of gentle psychiatry?
- No, but it sounds good.

347
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,830
Does it mean you're locked up without feeling pain?

348
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:56,000
Listen, Foegi...
Thanks.

349
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:01,300
my profession is by far not as monstrous as you seem to think.

350
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:05,200
Sorry, it's nothing personal.

351
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:10,500
Anyway, I'm not in a hurry to visit your facility.

352
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:16,300
Well, I've got some things to do.

353
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,300
Couldn't you keep this gentleman company?

354
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:27,700
- You don't mind, do you?
- That is for Beni to decide.

355
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,200
At the Odeon, in two hours.

356
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,900
- Let me...
- No, it's on me.

357
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:45,800
This is a bit... I mean,
you don't have to stay if you don't want.

358
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,300
No, it's fine.

359
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,900
Would you like anything to drink?

360
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,160
For whom is this piece?

361
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,600
Faster, faster, faster!

362
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,200
Come on and get it!

363
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,200
Get it, get it!

364
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,500
No, not on the bed!
Get down!

365
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:44,300
Come on.

366
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,600
Come on now.

367
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:49,700
If you're good, you can have it.

368
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,500
But only if you're good.

369
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:03,900
Show Foegi what a good dog you are.

370
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,700
Yes, that's good.

371
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,300
That's a good dog.

372
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:16,500
You want it?

373
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:18,500
Easy.

374
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:27,500
Good dog.

375
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:42,400
Foegi saw to it that I cultivated my connections with wealthy men.

376
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:47,300
I was walking the streets now and very much in demand.

377
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:52,700
At that time, it was all over with The Minks.

378
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:56,600
But Foegi didn't care since I earned enough money for both of us.

379
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Hi.

380
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:33,500
The architect called.

381
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,300
You have an appointment for tomorrow.

382
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,900
- Have you been swimming?
- Yes.

383
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,000
How many rounds did you swim?

384
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:50,700
10.

385
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,600
You should do 15.

386
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,400
Build up your muscles.

387
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,600
I'm in the other room.

388
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:43,600
Sometimes I didn't speak a word
all day long exept "yes" and "no".

389
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:48,400
I felt a new happiness.
Not being responsible for anything anymore.

390
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:53,300
There were no words in my head,
only eyes, a mouth,

391
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:55,800
and the dream of a sleeping dog.

392
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:34,500
That must be Wirsling.

393
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:38,100
But you'll stay here tonight.

394
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:40,100
No, I must go.

395
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:51,900
There is also a physical strength.
Do you see it?

396
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:55,400
The almost erotic expression of this painting.

397
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,100
This conception was of course a challenge

398
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:01,600
to the conservative and mannierist style of that epoch.

399
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,600
Like a freeze-frame in a movie.

400
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:08,600
Beni?

401
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:14,000
What's wrong?
Don't you feel well?

402
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:16,800
It's the vodka.

403
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,300
Come and lie down.

404
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:03,600
You're not eating?

405
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,200
No, I'm not hungry.

406
01:07:10,510 --> 01:07:13,600
- What's the matter, Beni?
- Nothing. I'm fine.

407
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:18,100
What drugs did you take?

408
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:20,300
Heroin?

409
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:22,700
Stop it, Bruno!
I've said I'm fine.

410
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:26,600
I took some acid and had a bad trip, that's all.

411
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:33,600
That guy is bad for you.

412
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:35,700
I'm serious.

413
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,200
Listen to me.

414
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:43,400
I've made you a proposal.

415
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:45,300
It still stands.

416
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:47,700
I can get you an apartment.

417
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:51,500
And I'll ask Robert to let you work at his gallery if you want.

418
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:55,000
Would I have to let him paw me as well?

419
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:01,600
That was nasty, Beni.

420
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,200
- Is that you, Beni?
- Yes.

421
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:02,100
Poor Toebe.

422
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:05,700
We had completely forgotten and never taken care of him.

423
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:10,400
He used to say The Minks were the most important part of his life.

424
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:13,700
Now we know that he meant what he said.

425
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:22,400
He left me a letter.

426
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:27,200
You see, he did it.

427
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:32,400
He really did it, you understand?

428
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:36,600
What do we do now?

429
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:47,300
We have to call someone.

430
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,100
I did not know he would go so far.

431
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,500
I wasn't really sad,

432
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:04,900
rather baffled that someone who always had been around suddenly was gone.

433
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:09,900
And I felt guilty because Foegi had withdrawn from Toebe because of me.

434
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:21,200
I accepted a job as a model.

435
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:24,600
All those old gay geezers started to get on my nerves.

436
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:27,430
So I tried something more serious.

437
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:31,300
Well, serious...

438
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:51,400
Hello?

439
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,150
Hello, Mr. Schaefer.

440
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:55,900
Yes.

441
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:57,500
Which time?

442
01:10:58,700 --> 01:10:59,900
7 pm?

443
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:03,700
Shall I wear anything special?

444
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:05,300
Okay, very well.

445
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:08,300
See you then.

446
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:14,900
I didn't hear you come.

447
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:20,600
Have you seen my dope?

448
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:23,200
I put it here this morning.

449
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:25,600
- I took it.
- What!

450
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:28,600
Are you crazy?
Why did you take my dope?

451
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:32,000
What do you mean by "my dope"?
I paid for it.

452
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:38,300
Can you roll me a joint?

453
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:47,600
Do it yourself.
I have to take care of the laundry.

454
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:53,200
Beni,
bring me a beer!

455
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,700
Hurry up, I'm thirsty!

456
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:03,500
Would you mind bringing me a beer?

457
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,400
What are you sitting there?

458
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,500
See, that's what I want.

459
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:21,000
I met Reto today.

460
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:24,900
He asked me what I was doing currently.

461
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:28,600
What should I have told him?

462
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:35,100
Do you even remember Reto?

463
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:39,000
My classmate.

464
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:43,300
I had a wonderful day.

465
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:48,100
Schaefer gave me a blowjob.

466
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,600
It was great.

467
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:53,000
What's wrong with you?

468
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:55,000
Mick Jagger is dead.

469
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:57,100
What?

470
01:14:57,500 --> 01:15:00,480
They talked about it on TV.

471
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:05,100
Are you brain fucking me? 

472
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:08,100
You're such a slob.

473
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:11,900
Look at yourself!
You make me sick.

474
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:15,600
Do you realize how low you've sunk?

475
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:18,700
But you don't give a damn, huh?

476
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:22,500
What?
Get lost if it doesn't suit you.

477
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:24,300
And what will become of you then?

478
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:28,700
I didn't ask you for a thing!
Fuck off! Get lost!

479
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:31,600
Did I ask you to do the cleaning?

480
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:36,200
You can't do it.
You can't do it yourself.

481
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:41,800
You can't even take care of yourself.
You can't do anything!

482
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,900
Look at this place!
It stinks, it sucks!

483
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:47,100
It sucks and stinks!

484
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,100
Calm down!

485
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:54,000
Just look at yourself!
Look at yourself!

486
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:56,500
Enough of this!
I've had enough of this!

487
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:02,300
Just go on and smash up the whole place.

488
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:04,000
Fuck you!

489
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:16,400
Beni.

490
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:22,000
Where did you put "The Beggars Banquet"?

491
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:25,300
Damned...

492
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:33,000
Beni.

493
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:38,100
Come on, have a drink with me.

494
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,400
Come on.

495
01:16:54,660 --> 01:16:56,660
Beni, sit.

496
01:16:59,450 --> 01:17:02,520
Sit, I said.
I said, sit!

497
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:35,700
- You're so kind.
- It's alright.

498
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:43,200
You're really a nice guy.

499
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:47,800
I love you very much, you know?

500
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,100
Do you know that?

501
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:02,900
I love you more than anyone else.

502
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:11,000
I'm so sorry.

503
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:18,900
I can understand that you don't love me anymore.

504
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,700
But I still love you.

505
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:24,700
No.

506
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:29,700
I've treated you so badly.

507
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,200
It's alright.

508
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:36,300
All I want is to be with you.

509
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:39,500
Everything else doesn't matter.

510
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:47,000
I've treated you so badly.

511
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:12,800
There was no alternative for us but to leave Zurich.

512
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:16,700
But for Foegi it wasn't just a vacation.

513
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:19,400
He would never return to Switzerland.

514
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:30,600
Foegi!
Foegi!

515
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:36,100
- Won't you go swimming with me?
- I feel like playing a little.

516
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:38,800
- Okay, I'm off then. See you.
- See you.

517
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:34,100
- Do you mind that they're here?
- No.

518
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:53,000
I read in a newspaper article

519
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,400
that in 2004 a meteorite will explode on Earth.

520
01:20:56,400 --> 01:21:01,100
All life on Earth will be wiped out.
We won't be here anymore.

521
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:05,400
It was a scientist who found this out.
So we will all perish.

522
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:06,600
Is this really a fact?

523
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:09,800
Yes, because it will impact with a tremendous force.

524
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,200
Well, if it's like this,
we have to enjoy our life to the fullest.

525
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:59,800
There was no need to talk about it.
I knew what was going on in his head.

526
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:04,700
He had already made up his mind.
That's why he was so relaxed and content.

527
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:07,500
But I was afraid of dying.

528
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:46,800
Hello.

529
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:51,800
Come.

530
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,500
Do you think this is enough?

531
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:44,300
Yes, it's first-class stuff.

532
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:53,700
Wait. 
Hold the spoon a little higher.

533
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:55,400
That's right.

534
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:59,600
If only I was not so afraid of needles...

535
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:01,000
Give it to me.

536
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:16,300
Don't be afraid.
You have great veins.

537
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:18,200
I have to pee.

538
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:20,800
Make a fist.

539
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,200
Like this?

540
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,100
Yes, that's right.

541
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:04,400
Excuse me, please let me through.

542
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:11,600
His pulse is weak.
Hurry up.

543
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:17,100
Foegi didn't make it,
but I pulled through.

544
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:21,400
Maybe because I didn't want to die
or because I was younger and healthier.

545
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:24,300
Perhaps Foegi gave me a smaller dose.
I don't know.

546
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:41,000
I felt very tired,
as if I had not slept for 100 years.

547
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:44,400
I thought I could never catch up on all the lost sleep.

548
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:47,000
But this fatigue was also a relief.

549
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Maybe because of the medication they had given me at hospital

550
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,400
I felt lighter and emptier.

551
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:57,500
In this emptiness was sadness
but also consolation.

552
01:26:57,500 --> 01:27:01,200
And of course I asked myself over and over again and still do:

553
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:05,800
If I had loved him more and differently,
perhaps he wouldn't have died.

554
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:09,000
Should our paths cross again, Foegi,

555
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:12,800
I'll try harder to love you so that nothing can separate us.

556
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:18,100
I swear, next time I'll be stronger.
Next time...
