1
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:34,290
February 9th, 1995
Seventh anniversary of

2
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,957
the death of Osamu Tezuka.

3
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:39,165
I started visiting him,

4
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,874
when I was only 15 years old.

5
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:46,040
It has been approximately 34 years.

6
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:49,040
It's a great honour for me

7
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:50,457
to have lived

8
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:53,749
the same age as Mr. Tezuka.

9
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:02,165
Mr. Tezuka traversed the Showa era

10
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:05,290
at lightning speed.

11
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:09,665
I regret that he didn't have longer

12
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:11,957
to work on his creation.

13
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:17,124
He's gone too soon.

14
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:26,582
Time absorbs all men

15
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,707
without distinction,

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,332
whether great or ordinary.

17
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:36,165
I felt it sorely.

18
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,999
The world of Manga is very empty

19
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:42,374
without Mr. Tezuka.

20
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:54,957
Haunted by memories of the past,

21
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,207
I could not stand it

22
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:02,124
and left the ceremony
before it was over.

23
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:13,832
I felt so tired.

24
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,707
The days of my youth

25
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,749
devoted to the passionate pursuit

26
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:26,582
of my dream of Gekiga

27
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,082
I miss sorely.

28
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,582
Three years after the end of war,

29
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,415
the sound of hammers echoed again

30
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:16,457
and Osaka finally seemed
to come back to life.

31
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,290
But for us ordinary people,

32
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:22,957
the lack of food was
a day-to-day routine.

33
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:26,165
I was born in Osaka,

34
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,624
in 1935.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,457
At the end of the Second World War,

36
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:35,332
I was only 10 years old.

37
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:06,249
August 6th, 1971

38
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,832
Peace Park in Hiroshima

39
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,499
Get lost, Minister Satô!

40
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,457
Calm down!

41
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:14,374
Get off me!

42
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,915
It was raining that day.

43
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,499
A black rain ...

44
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,499
for 26 years,

45
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,624
black rain continues

46
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,874
to fall on my heart,

47
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,624
never letting me rest.

48
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,624
In 1945

49
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,957
August 6th

50
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,707
at 8:00 am,

51
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:44,915
an atomic bomb exploded

52
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,582
480 meters over Hiroshima

53
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:51,082
instantly turning the world into hell.

54
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:56,665
Appointed by the press service
of the Department of War

55
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,749
I was immediately sent to Hiroshima.

56
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:03,374
A black rain ...

57
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,332
Gloomy ...

58
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,957
The passengers were sitting quietly,
in the burned out tram.

59
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,999
As I got closer,

60
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,040
I realised they were burnt on site.

61
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,374
The powerful radiation of the bomb

62
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:41,207
had printed a human shadow
on the steps of a bank.

63
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:46,999
The shadow of a spiral staircase
engraved forever ...

64
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:54,165
I pressed the trigger
like one possessed.

65
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,124
I walked through the debris

66
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:02,374
to reach an alley where
a burned out house stood.

67
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:08,832
I discovered a sight so upsetting,
that I immediately

68
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,874
burst into tears.

69
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,165
On a wall,

70
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:17,249
two human shadows were printed clearly.

71
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,207
Probably a mother and her son?

72
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:27,874
The devoted son was massaging
his mother when the bomb

73
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,499
surprised them.

74
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,374
Sobbing,

75
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,249
I pressed the shutter button.

76
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,499
My eyes filled with tears,

77
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,249
I was blinded.

78
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,582
Does God not exist?

79
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:48,999
How can such things happen?

80
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:54,374
Not stopping to cry, I helped to carry

81
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:58,707
victims to a health centre.

82
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:05,207
I was completely numb when
I returned to the department.

83
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,207
Looking at the prints that night,

84
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,832
I burst into tears again.

85
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:34,707
Three days later, I returned to
the location of the photograph.

86
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:41,665
The wall on which the
shadows were printed

87
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,624
had disappeared.

88
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:49,749
Excuse me ...

89
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,790
Do you know who lived here?

90
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,499
It was the house of the Yamadas.

91
00:07:57,291 --> 00:08:02,415
They lived here in pairs,
a mother and her son.

92
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:06,040
They were found burned, both.

93
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:12,290
My hunch was right ...

94
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:16,249
a devoted son massaging his mother.

95
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,207
Despite the smell of dozens
of thousands of corpses

96
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,624
burning all around,

97
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:30,040
the sight of the sunset
was incredibly beautiful.

98
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,624
Then the war ended.

99
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,457
Japan barely recovered,

100
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:41,207
signed the Treaty of Peace

101
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,165
in September 1951.

102
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:50,249
<i>Journal Sanyô Maiasa

103
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,707
This photograph is exceptional.

104
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:57,207
It could move all of Japan ...

105
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,999
Who knows, even the world?

106
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,874
I'd like to sell it to you.

107
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:09,249
For over 6 years I kept it
without showing anyone.

108
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,790
Today, I need money.

109
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,874
Thanks to the treaty, we can finally
publish pictures of the bomb.

110
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,290
We offer you a good price.

111
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,790
The money I got for the photo
allowed me to feed my family

112
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,165
despite my unemployment.

113
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:30,540
But I was tortured

114
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:33,624
by the voice of my conscience.

115
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,999
Mom ... let me massage you!

116
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,957
What's gotten into you?

117
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,749
You're soaked in sweat!

118
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,832
A bad dream ...

119
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:55,415
<i>A devoted son and his mother!
The moving shadows of the Yamadas

120
00:09:56,166 --> 00:10:00,707
The photograph upset all of Japan.

121
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:05,874
The Maiasa published a series of
articles on the sacrificed mother and son.

122
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:10,165
<i>The faces of the son Kiyoshi and his
mother Mado are finally revealed

123
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:14,207
Let's raise a fund to build
a statue in their memory.

124
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:17,749
Their image must live forever!

125
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:21,332
<i>Poems and movies dedicated
to the devoted son

126
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:25,624
Another article calling you
a great photographer!

127
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,790
With the impact of my photography,

128
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,582
my guilt faded.

129
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:35,415
I even developed a secret pride.

130
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:38,790
Fantastic, right?

131
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:43,165
A famous sculptor created this statue.

132
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:47,582
The Maiasa decided to send him abroad

133
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,249
to represent our campaign

134
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,499
<i>No More Hiroshima</i> worldwide.

135
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:58,415
Mr. Koyanagi, take the lead
of our movement!

136
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,540
Me travelling the world?

137
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,707
I'll do my best.

138
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:09,790
I carry with me the memory
of the 200,000 victims of the bomb.

139
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,874
I'll spread <i>No More Hiroshima
</i>in the world!

140
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:16,082
We count on you, Mr. Koyanagi!

141
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:20,457
Every day, when the
limousine of the journal

142
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:23,582
came to pick me up with its flag,

143
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,165
I was carried in pride.

144
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:32,582
<i>Rest in peace
Our mistakes will not be repeated

145
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,165
You are Mr. Koyanagi?

146
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,374
So you're the one who invited me here.

147
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:45,082
I'm in a hurry, tell me what you want.

148
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,957
Will you attend the inauguration
ceremony of the statue?

149
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,874
You became famous!

150
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:59,499
With nothing but a miserable picture.

151
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,707
What a charade.

152
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:04,665
The photo of a devoted son?

153
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,790
Takes a lot of nerve to pass a murder

154
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:10,457
for a simple massage.

155
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,457
What do you say?

156
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,790
That it was the image of a murder.

157
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,957
He was going to strangle her
when the bomb exploded.

158
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,415
What?

159
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,540
I have proof!

160
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,707
Who are you?

161
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,290
You're crazy!

162
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:34,207
Tell me who you are!

163
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:37,790
Don't you recognise this face?

164
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:41,499
Remember. I was in the newspaper!

165
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,915
I'm Kiyoshi Yamada.

166
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,707
The devoted son of the statue!

167
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,624
What are you talking about?

168
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,874
The mother and her son
were dead on the spot.

169
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,082
They were found burned!

170
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,499
They are on the list of victims.

171
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,999
There has been two deaths ...

172
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:10,707
but the boy was one of my friends.

173
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:14,290
I asked him to kill my mother.

174
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,499
On the day of the bomb,

175
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:23,540
I was mobilised in Kure
in a weapons factory.

176
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:28,624
My friend had to take care of
my mother during this time.

177
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:32,499
The bomb was dropped that morning.

178
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,540
I quickly returned to Hiroshima.

179
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,707
I saw the printed image,

180
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:43,415
the murder that I commissioned.

181
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:47,499
I rushed to tear down the wall.

182
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:49,749
The wall ...

183
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,707
It's true that it has been collapsed.

184
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:54,957
Yes,

185
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,582
it was I who destroyed it.

186
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:01,790
I thought I had cleared
all the evidence ...

187
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,665
But then your statue

188
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,249
and all the fuss.

189
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,832
That I didn't expect!

190
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:12,915
What do you think?
You have before you the devoted son

191
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:16,415
that makes people cry in their cottages!

192
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,499
Why kill your mother?

193
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,540
I wanted money ...

194
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:24,374
Sell the house ...

195
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,457
Money for my pleasure.

196
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:30,249
I had enough of labouring like a maniac.

197
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,915
But everything is screwed.

198
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,207
Now, here I'm deprived of identity,

199
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:42,624
forced to live hidden like a rat.

200
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,040
I can not believe it.

201
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,415
It's impossible.

202
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:54,457
This statue, would it be
the symbol of matricide?

Call a doctor!

209
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,124
How is he, doctor?

210
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,332
Just a little anaemic.

211
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,290
He will be released soon.

212
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,874
A statue in honour of murder ...

213
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,582
I want money.

214
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:38,582
I want to have my share
of the funds collected.

215
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,290
I'm sick.

216
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:43,290
My lungs ...

217
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:48,207
In return, I'll keep the secret.

218
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:53,540
You'd be annoyed if
it came out now, right?

219
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,707
I count on you, Koyanagi.

220
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,457
I expect the money.

221
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,040
Is he okay?

222
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,874
He regained consciousness.

223
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:07,999
Thank you, Mr. Koyanagi.

224
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:11,207
Thanks to you, the pain of
the victims of the bomb

225
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,457

Hold on!

00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,082
Can I shake your hand?

228
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:24,915
One bomb was enough to
make more than 200,000 deaths.

229
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,874
More than 200,000!

230
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,165
One more ...

231
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,790
One more person added these 200,000 ...

232
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,707
It will not change anything.

233
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,124
Sorry for the delay, Koyanagi.

234
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,707
On this day ...

235
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:55,332
victims of the bomb came
here to find water.

236
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,749
A final walk.

237
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:02,207
Countless corpses floated here.

238
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:05,832
We still find bones.

239
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,499
You got the money?

240
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:11,082
I'll not give it to you, forget it.

241
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:12,790
This is donation money.

242
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:15,790
In this case,

243
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:19,540
I'll reveal the truth about the statue.

244
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:22,582
I don't have much longer.

245
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,582
I have nothing to lose.

246
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,790
Everyone will be disappointed, Koyanagi.

247
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,790
Your reputation will suffer.

Apparently,

252

the son in question is still alive.

253

We have seen better as a devoted son.

254
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,832
He came to seek compensation
from the newspaper

255
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,749
yesterday during the day.

256
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,749
According to our survey, he does
appear in the records of deaths,

257
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:36,499
but it's him.

258
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,915
I saw hell

259
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:48,915
trapped in my own heart.

260
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:56,124
And for 20 years

261
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,499
I lived as if I was endlessly

262
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:02,624

And yet ...

266
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:18,374
I can not find the courage
to confess my crime.

267
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,249

influenced by Yoshioki,

00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,874
my elder brother,
two years older than me.

278
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:09,915
I worked diligently every
day on a long strip.

279
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:15,124
We named Yoshioki <i>Okichan</i>.

280
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:23,082
He had been admitted
to Toneyama hospital,

281
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,207
but our limited resources

282
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:28,832
had forced him to return,
aborting his treatment.

283
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:33,874
Because he could no longer go to school,

284
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:37,249
his attitude towards me
suddenly changed.

285
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:40,207
When I went out in the morning,

286
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:43,332
his gaze hardened,

287
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:45,999
and his eyes

288
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:51,415
seemed to me full of jealousy
and anger against me.

289
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:55,165
Sometimes he found an excuse

290
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,832
to hit me for no reason.

291
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:01,249
These days, I went to school

292
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,874
weeping bitterly.

293
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:08,749
It took me 40 minutes
of walking every day

294
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:12,874
to get to the College of Toyonaka 2.

295
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,457
We were six in the family,

296
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,999
but my father was rarely seen.

297
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,165
I'm hungry.

298
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,999
Wait for Dad before starting dinner.

299
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:31,332
No, start without him.

300
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:35,957
We will not wait for a guy that
you cannot be sure to return at all.

Mom ignores Dad completely
when he returns.

00:25:13,791 --> 00:25:17,499
I had only drawn in order
to meet Mr. Tezuka.

but his huge amount of work

371
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:05,207
finally led Mr. Tezuka to Tokyo

372
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:09,540
for that he left Osaka.

373
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:12,249
I then realised that my mentor

374
00:26:12,416 --> 00:26:16,082
was now far and out of reach.

375
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:19,790
Tokyo had kidnapped him.

376
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:22,332
I thought of nothing else,
but going there.

377
00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:37,749
Habit is a horrible thing.

378
00:26:38,583 --> 00:26:42,082
For me, always working
in the centre of noise,

379
00:26:42,916 --> 00:26:47,082
silence seems to be the
most sinister of all there is.

380
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:50,207
When you have no intention to speak

381
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,582
any conversation seems pointless.

382
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:57,499
Machinery noise dominates,

383
00:26:57,708 --> 00:27:00,624
and men each live in their own corner.

384
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,915
Men are more numerous,

385
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:07,874
the connections between them are fading

386
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:11,207
and their loneliness deepens.

407

out by the masses,

408
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:58,374
forced to descend during the journey.

409
00:30:00,708 --> 00:30:02,332
I had not been back to Ueno

410
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,582
since my arrival from the
countryside five years before.

411
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:10,707
Naturally I set myself
in motion, nostalgic.

412
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:14,707
It was 5 years ago

413
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:18,582
I arrived at Ueno my chest
swollen with aspiration.

414
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:24,874
I no longer had the strength to
commit myself to the factory work.

415
00:30:27,666 --> 00:30:30,832
The zoo was less
frequented that morning

416
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,249
and it was as if

417
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:35,790
the animals observed the humans.

421
00:31:06,916 --> 00:31:09,999
The monkeys seemed troubled
by your presence.

422
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:14,290
This has encouraged me
to get to know you better.

why I need drawing so much.

524
00:42:10,916 --> 00:42:14,999

526
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,999

the only thing giving me the
energy to move forward

00:44:06,458 --> 00:44:10,624
with no one to stop me.

556
00:44:10,958 --> 00:44:16,332
It was a sweet life and full
of aspiration, new to me.

557
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:23,332
The cinema is my mentor.

558
00:44:26,916 --> 00:44:28,915
<i>THE SPARROW INN

559
00:44:32,875 --> 00:44:35,790
Of course, the young owner there

560
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,874
also prevented me from concentrating.

561
00:44:40,666 --> 00:44:41,624
Look who's here!

562
00:44:42,041 --> 00:44:43,832
Could you make me something to eat?

563
00:44:44,291 --> 00:44:46,290
It's rare to see you alone.

564
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,540
Saichan has a date

565
00:44:49,708 --> 00:44:52,457
and Macchan went to see his parents.

566
00:44:52,625 --> 00:44:55,749
His parents?
The celibacy must pressure him.

567
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:58,000
A grill, would that suit you?

568
00:44:58,291 --> 00:45:00,415
Perfect!

569
00:45:06,458 --> 00:45:07,790
I want a drink.

570
00:45:09,083 --> 00:45:10,207
Can I sit down?

571
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:11,540
Of course!

572
00:45:18,416 --> 00:45:19,624
Is it good?

573
00:45:23,875 --> 00:45:25,040
Can I have one?

574
00:45:25,208 --> 00:45:27,082
Once this is done.

575
00:45:28,541 --> 00:45:29,665
I want this one.

576
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:35,249
The sausage that you are chewing on.

577
00:45:37,916 --> 00:45:39,249
Hurry!

578
00:45:39,916 --> 00:45:41,332
But I've chewed it already ...

579
00:45:41,666 --> 00:45:44,457
That is the one I want.
Give it to me.

580
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:46,040
Come on ...

581
00:45:47,666 --> 00:45:48,749
Chirp!

582
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,749
I'm not a bird.

583
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:54,165
Me, I'm your little sparrow.

584
00:46:11,208 --> 00:46:13,374
Make me eat.

585
00:46:15,125 --> 00:46:16,790
The attitude of the owner

586
00:46:16,958 --> 00:46:20,124
was no doubt a way of

587
00:46:20,291 --> 00:46:22,040
expressing her affection,

588
00:46:24,541 --> 00:46:28,290
this was my first experience
with a woman.

589
00:46:41,083 --> 00:46:42,624
Within a month,

590
00:46:42,791 --> 00:46:46,749
he'll be marked as <i>senior </i>and
will be buried by the company.

591
00:46:49,125 --> 00:46:52,749
He could not bear the idea
of a boring retirement

592
00:46:52,916 --> 00:46:55,874
accompanied by his old wife.

593
00:46:57,083 --> 00:46:59,582
<i>Section Manager

594
00:47:02,583 --> 00:47:04,874
Already, nobody put any

595
00:47:05,041 --> 00:47:07,790
papers on his desk anymore.

596
00:47:09,541 --> 00:47:13,707
No employee spoke to him anymore
or called him <i>director.

597
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:20,040
All the work was divided
between his successors

598
00:47:20,208 --> 00:47:22,999
and everyone completely ignored him.

599
00:47:26,291 --> 00:47:29,457
In brief, Saburô Hanayama

600
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:33,832
might as well not exist anymore.

601
00:47:39,083 --> 00:47:40,540
Director.

602
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,040
Thank you for your dedication,
Miss Okawa.

603
00:47:46,833 --> 00:47:49,082
Director?

604
00:47:49,416 --> 00:47:51,457
You are very kind today.

605
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:55,582
He was touched.

606
00:47:56,125 --> 00:47:58,582
Had he been a little younger,

607
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,915
and if she wanted,

608
00:48:01,083 --> 00:48:04,207
he could love her
at the peril of his life.

609
00:48:07,708 --> 00:48:11,665
If only I could sleep
with her just once,

610
00:48:12,375 --> 00:48:15,957
I could die without regrets.

611
00:48:18,541 --> 00:48:20,957
No, no.

612
00:48:21,125 --> 00:48:23,499
I should not have these thoughts

613
00:48:23,666 --> 00:48:26,999
on a woman so sweet and pure.

614
00:48:29,625 --> 00:48:31,290
Miss Okawa,

615
00:48:31,791 --> 00:48:33,790
forgive me.

616
00:48:36,291 --> 00:48:38,040
<i>Bank

617
00:48:40,833 --> 00:48:42,415
Mr. Hanayama!

618
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:49,790
300,000 Yen.

619
00:48:52,875 --> 00:48:56,457
The money I secretly saved.

620
00:48:56,875 --> 00:48:58,749
I'll spend it during

621
00:48:58,916 --> 00:49:01,665
my remaining months.

622
00:49:10,041 --> 00:49:11,665
It should be 5 million.

623
00:49:11,833 --> 00:49:14,124
Surely more.

624
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:18,915
Like so ... You're home.

625
00:49:19,083 --> 00:49:20,915
We have not heard you.

626
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:22,082
Good evening!

627
00:49:23,291 --> 00:49:25,999
You still calculate my retirement?

628
00:49:26,625 --> 00:49:28,040
Do you never get tired?

629
00:49:28,208 --> 00:49:31,707
This will be our only income
once you're retired.

630
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:35,540
Yes. And us too, we are counting on it.

631
00:49:37,875 --> 00:49:40,332
His wife had never

632
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,165
cared about him.

633
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,249
This malevolent woman had
humiliated him for 30 years

634
00:49:48,541 --> 00:49:53,582
gradually, never resigning
from her arrogance.

635
00:49:59,125 --> 00:50:02,499
His only daughter
thought only of herself.

636
00:50:03,708 --> 00:50:07,832
Her mother had arranged her marriage,

637
00:50:08,958 --> 00:50:11,290
and Hanayama knew that his wife

638
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:16,290
had carnal relations
with her young son-in-law.

639
00:50:20,291 --> 00:50:23,207
You're going to take a bath
or do you want dinner?

640
00:50:24,583 --> 00:50:26,040
I'll take a bath.

641
00:50:30,166 --> 00:50:32,415
He had not slept with his wife

642
00:50:32,583 --> 00:50:35,665
for over 10 years.

643
00:50:38,916 --> 00:50:41,415
Suddenly bottomless anger

644
00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:44,874
filled his heart.

645
00:50:47,041 --> 00:50:48,540
This is hell.

646
00:50:49,291 --> 00:50:52,957
I'll never spend the rest
of my life cloistered

647
00:50:53,125 --> 00:50:56,499
with such a monster!

648
00:51:07,125 --> 00:51:09,415
Yasukuni Band of Brothers ...

649
00:51:10,416 --> 00:51:13,415
You left at the right time.

650
00:51:17,458 --> 00:51:19,290
Look at me.

651
00:51:20,333 --> 00:51:22,457
My company abandoned me

652
00:51:23,083 --> 00:51:25,499
and my wife has betrayed me.

653
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,790
I'm a walking corpse.

654
00:51:31,875 --> 00:51:35,749
The gun enthroned in the
middle of the sanctuary

655
00:51:35,916 --> 00:51:37,124
appeared to him majestic,

656
00:51:37,291 --> 00:51:39,540
like the symbol for the virility

657
00:51:39,708 --> 00:51:42,415
of his youth, forever buried.

658
00:51:43,541 --> 00:51:46,082
Suddenly his blood boiled in his veins,

659
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:49,082
and a feeling of potent determination

660
00:51:49,291 --> 00:51:51,415
invaded him there.

661
00:51:52,916 --> 00:51:54,415
I'm still a man!

662
00:51:54,708 --> 00:51:57,790
I'll show him that I can cheat on her!

663
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:01,624
I'm going to buy women
with my 300,000 Yen.

664
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,957
He decided to betray his wife

665
00:52:06,125 --> 00:52:08,374
by cheating on her for the first time.

666
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:13,457
He thought that deceiving his
wife would grant him a retreat

667
00:52:13,625 --> 00:52:15,957
from the visions of hell

668
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:18,957
present in her company.

669
00:52:38,541 --> 00:52:42,832
It's rare to see a client
take a bath in a <i>Turkish Bath</i>.

670
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:47,290
What are they for then?

671
00:52:48,083 --> 00:52:49,915
Well you know it ...

672
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:52,165
What would you like?

673
00:52:52,375 --> 00:52:56,165
The clock is ticking.
A special or a double?

674
00:52:59,125 --> 00:53:03,582
It's not enough to sleep
with a woman to be unfaithful.

675
00:53:03,916 --> 00:53:08,457
It must be a real woman,
one I'm in love with.

676
00:53:08,958 --> 00:53:11,415
Otherwise, it's not betrayal.

677
00:53:12,166 --> 00:53:14,124
<i>A rendezvous at night-time in Tokyo?

678
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:15,999

00:53:29,041 --> 00:53:31,249
They are all amateurs.

Good evening.

684
00:53:37,416 --> 00:53:39,040
She is pretty.

685
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:41,999
I'm starving of hunger!

686
00:53:42,166 --> 00:53:43,915
Let's go eat sushi.

687
00:53:45,291 --> 00:53:47,582
That looks delicious!

688
00:53:48,083 --> 00:53:51,415
I'd love to have dessert now!

689
00:53:52,458 --> 00:53:54,415
This is sweet!

690
00:54:02,375 --> 00:54:05,124
I'd like to sleep with you.

691
00:54:16,958 --> 00:54:19,665
You are a nice girl.

692

00:54:25,375 --> 00:54:26,332
Kazumi.

694
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:29,415
That's a pretty name.

695
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:33,832
Mister ...

696
00:54:37,208 --> 00:54:38,624
What is it?

697
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:41,124
I'm starving.

698
00:54:41,291 --> 00:54:43,749
Can I have eel before?

00:54:43,958 --> 00:54:45,832
Please.

700
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:53,082
Having an affair with a woman

701
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:55,374
is not as simple as that.

702
00:55:07,666 --> 00:55:09,040
Miss Okawa.

703
00:55:11,458 --> 00:55:14,374
You look lonely, Sir.

704
00:55:15,083 --> 00:55:16,707
No, why ...

705
00:55:18,541 --> 00:55:19,582
Thank you.

706
00:55:20,166 --> 00:55:23,915
I feel very lonely too.

707
00:55:25,041 --> 00:55:26,832
Impossible ...

708
00:55:27,083 --> 00:55:29,749
Someone as lovely as you.

709
00:55:30,708 --> 00:55:33,582
If you agree,

710
00:55:33,958 --> 00:55:36,957
we could have dinner tonight.

711
00:55:37,916 --> 00:55:39,290

712
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,540
Go ahead, please.

713
00:55:45,625 --> 00:55:47,082
I'm happy.

714
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:49,457
You're so nice to me.

715
00:55:50,291 --> 00:55:54,957
He invited her to a luxury restaurant.

716
00:55:55,458 --> 00:55:57,290
He was thrilled.

717
00:55:58,375 --> 00:56:02,582
They walked through
the city hand in hand.

718
00:56:03,333 --> 00:56:06,124
He felt like in a dream.

719
00:56:11,083 --> 00:56:12,457
Miss Okawa ...

720
00:56:13,166 --> 00:56:16,040
You should not drink so much.

721
00:56:16,375 --> 00:56:19,457
It's okay. I want to be drunk.

722
00:56:22,583 --> 00:56:24,374
Director ...

723
00:56:24,541 --> 00:56:25,499
Today,

724
00:56:26,541 --> 00:56:29,165
I have a broken heart.

725
00:56:31,291 --> 00:56:33,207
My lover ...

726
00:56:34,083 --> 00:56:36,624
married the daughter of a rich man.

727
00:56:47,333 --> 00:56:50,999
The goddess he worshiped
laid in his arms.

728
00:56:51,625 --> 00:56:54,207
His heart was about to burst,

729
00:56:55,083 --> 00:56:59,540
but unlike his feelings, the
organ of his manhood refused

730
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,790
to respond to the excitement.

731
00:57:04,791 --> 00:57:06,374
This can't be.

732
00:57:09,041 --> 00:57:10,915
He panicked.

733
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,207
What is it, Sir?

734
00:57:17,875 --> 00:57:19,790
He burst into tears.

735
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:24,624
And she wept as well.

736
00:57:25,833 --> 00:57:28,915
Yet, their adventure had

737
00:57:29,083 --> 00:57:30,957
liberated them from their grief.

738
00:57:34,333 --> 00:57:37,499
In the Yasukuni Shrine,
the night was mournful.

739
00:57:43,041 --> 00:57:47,749
He thought of suicide in front of
his comrades, but changed his mind.

740
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:53,665
My wife certainly awaits
my death with impatience.

741
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:57,832
When I die, she'll receive the

742
00:57:58,083 --> 00:58:00,332
money from my life insurance.

743
00:58:02,166 --> 00:58:03,707
I can not die.

744
00:58:03,958 --> 00:58:07,332
I have to live long,
whatever happens.

745
00:58:07,833 --> 00:58:10,582
This is the only way to avenge myself.

746
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:16,124
The barrel of the sanctuary stood there,

747
00:58:16,291 --> 00:58:18,915
a black mass in the darkness.

748
00:58:24,666 --> 00:58:27,540
He climbed onto the barrel

749
00:58:27,708 --> 00:58:30,040
and urinated on it at length.

750
00:58:35,458 --> 00:58:38,499
Maybe I'm impotent

751
00:58:39,041 --> 00:58:41,540
facing life.

752
00:58:43,125 --> 00:58:44,915
But look at you, canon.

753
00:58:45,166 --> 00:58:47,457
You are as impotent as me.

754
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,707
In fact, you are the
symbol of impotence.

<i>I'm a murderer? Lies!

756
00:59:06,166 --> 00:59:09,790
After two months with Masahiko Matsumoto

757
00:59:09,958 --> 00:59:12,832
and Takao Saito, I left the apartment

758
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,665

and I felt confident again.

762
00:59:44,333 --> 00:59:47,790
So that's it, the pleasure of creation!

763
00:59:48,708 --> 00:59:50,207
I didn't know!

764
00:59:51,875 --> 00:59:54,415

the Manga for children.

777
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:47,249
Of course they are taken

It's true what Okichan told me,

781
01:01:56,666 --> 01:01:59,999
we should not call
<i>Black Blizzard</i> a Manga.

782
01:02:00,833 --> 01:02:04,457
Our works are different from
the Manga for children.

783
01:02:05,333 --> 01:02:07,874
Let's be clear on this.

784
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:15,165

789
01:02:30,541 --> 01:02:32,665
That sounds awfully good.

790
01:02:32,833 --> 01:02:34,707
Yes, I also like <i>Gekiga</i>.

791
01:02:35,041 --> 01:02:38,499
It has body and gives a dramatic nuance.

792
01:02:38,833 --> 01:02:41,915
That is agreed. Go for <i>Gekiga!

by a realistic drawing style

805
01:03:32,541 --> 01:03:35,374

811
01:04:00,541 --> 01:04:04,790
I also sent one to master Osamu Tezuka.

812
01:04:05,458 --> 01:04:10,040
In the book that he wrote later,

813
01:04:10,208 --> 01:04:14,832
he acknowledged having been
perplexed by Gekiga,

814
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:19,124
and when this genre
experienced a great success

815
01:04:19,291 --> 01:04:24,249

plucked me and threw me
out unceremoniously.

the graffiti had already changed.

868
01:10:09,458 --> 01:10:13,749
Someone had drawn them again,
after their removal.

869
01:10:19,541 --> 01:10:23,415
I guess for the last episode,
that will do the trick.

My talent was gone.

875
01:10:48,291 --> 01:10:53,165
Say there was a time when
I could not help but draw.

876
01:10:54,666 --> 01:10:56,790
It's been more than 10 years

877
01:10:56,958 --> 01:10:59,915
and I have not felt that urge since.

878
01:11:03,416 --> 01:11:07,457
When I regained my senses,
I was already on the toilet.

879
01:11:09,625 --> 01:11:14,582
The graffiti were all obscene
and repetitive.

880
01:11:16,791 --> 01:11:21,457
I imagined the man who drew them.

881
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:27,457
At least he was tortured
by the desire to draw.

882
01:11:28,875 --> 01:11:31,790
I felt evil, alone on the toilet

883
01:11:31,958 --> 01:11:34,957
thinking such thoughts.

884
01:11:35,166 --> 01:11:37,165
I laughed out loud.

885
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:52,207
The crowd rushes about outside,
but in here everything is quiet.

886
01:11:52,375 --> 01:11:55,124
This is the place where I'm at best.

887
01:12:06,541 --> 01:12:08,665
I sat at my desk,

888
01:12:08,833 --> 01:12:10,999
but the inspiration would not come.

889
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,290
I was afraid to leave my desk,

890
01:12:15,791 --> 01:12:17,832
but could not manage to concentrate.

891
01:12:20,916 --> 01:12:23,165
What will I become?

892
01:12:28,083 --> 01:12:30,082
The author of the graffiti,

893
01:12:30,250 --> 01:12:33,040
didn't he draw only by
going to the toilet?

894
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:38,249
Or did he deliberately
went there to draw?

895
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,749
So you no longer work
on children's books?

896
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:00,540
That is good.

897
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:04,832

898
01:13:05,166 --> 01:13:06,457
What do you say?

899
01:13:07,166 --> 01:13:10,374
But <i>Play</i> is a magazine for adults.

900
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:12,707
Exactly.

901
01:13:13,083 --> 01:13:15,540
You don't miss talent,

902
01:13:15,708 --> 01:13:18,582
but you'll not draw for children.

903
01:13:19,583 --> 01:13:23,540
So come to my office in an hour.

904
01:13:25,625 --> 01:13:27,957
I'll be waiting for you.

905
01:13:30,125 --> 01:13:33,290

01:13:37,625 --> 01:13:40,165
I had never thought about this genre.

907
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:42,624
But thinking about it,

908
01:13:42,791 --> 01:13:45,915
vibrant images crossed my mind.

909
01:13:47,166 --> 01:13:48,915
I can do it!

910
01:13:49,083 --> 01:13:52,874
This is the opportunity
I was waiting for!

911
01:13:54,666 --> 01:13:59,790
It was as if I woke up from
a sleep of several years.

912
01:14:01,666 --> 01:14:02,957
I freed you.

913
01:14:11,958 --> 01:14:15,457
My body was boiling with excitement.

914
01:14:18,333 --> 01:14:23,207
My heart beat so violently,
I could not sit still.

915
01:14:23,416 --> 01:14:25,249
I have to draw!

916
01:14:26,791 --> 01:14:29,457
This desire occupied all my mind.

917
01:14:50,125 --> 01:14:53,624
The toilet walls were all clean.

918
01:14:55,416 --> 01:14:59,040
The charwoman had made the
effort to clean them.

919
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:12,665
What ails you?

920
01:15:12,833 --> 01:15:14,332
A pervert!

921
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:15,915
In the toilet!

922
01:15:17,875 --> 01:15:21,499
There's a pervert in the toilet.
Call the police.

923
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:23,499
What is it?

924
01:15:23,666 --> 01:15:24,874
A pervert?

925
01:15:25,166 --> 01:15:25,874
Is it him?

926
01:15:27,416 --> 01:15:28,832
Quick, call the police!

927
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:53,540
Like the hero of <i>Occupied</i>.

928
01:15:54,666 --> 01:15:58,040
I had no other choice
than to publish

929
01:15:58,208 --> 01:16:01,915
in monthly or weekly journals.

930
01:16:03,375 --> 01:16:05,499
The stories you have seen

931
01:16:05,666 --> 01:16:09,207
were all written in the seventies.

932
01:16:09,583 --> 01:16:12,832
All my works from this period

933
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,999
are imbued with a deep malaise .

934
01:16:22,625 --> 01:16:26,207
This was the period of
large growth in Japan

935
01:16:26,375 --> 01:16:31,290
and many Japanese enjoyed that wealth.

936
01:16:32,166 --> 01:16:36,124
I could not bear to see

937
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:41,457
all these euphoric and indecent people.

938
01:16:43,291 --> 01:16:47,707
The wave of wealth didn't
caught on to us, neither to me 

939
01:16:47,875 --> 01:16:50,290
nor to the people surrounding me.

940
01:16:50,583 --> 01:16:53,999
My anger against this state of affairs

941
01:16:54,208 --> 01:16:58,582
concentrated in a black mass
at the bottom of my heart.

942
01:17:01,375 --> 01:17:03,207
This is one explanation.

943
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:12,624
I devise my stories more and more

944
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:15,790
often in cafés close to me.

945
01:17:19,166 --> 01:17:20,707
I attend

946
01:17:20,875 --> 01:17:22,624
four different cafés

947
01:17:23,166 --> 01:17:25,249
to work on my stories.

948
01:17:32,875 --> 01:17:37,040
My wife was working
in one of those cafés.

949
01:17:46,125 --> 01:17:51,124
We settled down together, of course.

950
01:17:57,541 --> 01:18:01,415
I never knew anything besides drawing

951
01:18:01,583 --> 01:18:05,499
and I lived just on my works.

952
01:18:06,958 --> 01:18:10,499
Dealing with a white sheet,
a pencil in the hand

953
01:18:10,666 --> 01:18:14,665
for drawing tirelessly,
is a hard and lonely work.

954
01:18:16,541 --> 01:18:19,957
Once cured of his chest disease,

955
01:18:20,125 --> 01:18:23,707
Okichan had no other choice

956
01:18:23,875 --> 01:18:28,874
than to opt for an ordinary job
distant from Manga.

957
01:18:29,041 --> 01:18:32,582
It has been very hard for him
with his health problems.

958
01:18:35,541 --> 01:18:37,874
My greatest joy

959
01:18:38,041 --> 01:18:41,457
is to invent stories.

960
01:18:41,666 --> 01:18:43,832
It's an opportunity to rediscover and

961
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,207
glimpse into unknown worlds.

962
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:51,832
A Manga is 70% complete,
once the story is defined.

963
01:18:52,041 --> 01:18:56,207
The remaining 30%, it's fun to draw.

964
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,499
But my ideal is not so much of

965
01:18:59,666 --> 01:19:02,874
developing stories, but

966
01:19:03,041 --> 01:19:05,749
passionately giving life to images,

967
01:19:05,916 --> 01:19:10,624
gushing spontaneously from my mind.

968
01:19:11,416 --> 01:19:14,499
Everything artificial resembles a lie.

969
01:19:30,541 --> 01:19:31,582
Come!

970
01:19:31,875 --> 01:19:32,999
Joe, come!

971
01:19:33,333 --> 01:19:34,749
I'm coming, baby!

972
01:19:49,916 --> 01:19:52,999
I love you, Mari. I love you so much.

973
01:19:56,583 --> 01:19:58,832
We will get married, okay?

974
01:20:00,083 --> 01:20:01,915
No worry, no worry.

975
01:20:02,458 --> 01:20:04,124
I'm okay.

976
01:20:05,416 --> 01:20:07,915
No, no. I'll marry you and

977
01:20:08,166 --> 01:20:10,290
I'll take you back to America.

978
01:20:14,041 --> 01:20:15,624
Again, the brats from next door.

979
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,207
Hey, you whore!

980
01:20:19,083 --> 01:20:22,599
Beat it! Get the hell out of here!

981
01:20:23,041 --> 01:20:23,749
Ouch!

982
01:20:24,125 --> 01:20:25,540
Bitch!

983
01:20:25,791 --> 01:20:26,999
Soldiers slut!

984
01:20:31,833 --> 01:20:33,999
Mariko, are you okay?

985
01:20:34,166 --> 01:20:36,707
What do you want, again?

986
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:39,374
Why talk like that

987
01:20:39,541 --> 01:20:42,415
to your old father.

988
01:20:42,708 --> 01:20:46,915
I just came to see my little darling.

989
01:20:48,875 --> 01:20:51,665
I took the liberty to return.

990
01:20:52,333 --> 01:20:55,332
You promised me not to come
back anymore.

991
01:20:56,666 --> 01:20:58,332
A new client?

992
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:01,374
This is not the same sergeant as before.

993
01:21:04,958 --> 01:21:06,790
How do you do?

994
01:21:06,958 --> 01:21:09,874
I'm this girls father.

995
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:11,582
Father?

996
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:14,415
Yes, yes, papa.

997
01:21:14,583 --> 01:21:16,499
Thank you very much.

998
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:25,790
Mariko, you allowed
yourself a nice big bed.

999
01:21:26,541 --> 01:21:30,707
It's because these Americans are beefy!

1000
01:21:37,750 --> 01:21:40,124
What is with the money?

1001
01:21:40,791 --> 01:21:42,499
You came for that, right?

1002
01:21:42,666 --> 01:21:44,957
So take it and go away.

1003
01:21:54,541 --> 01:21:55,874
This is unfair.

1004
01:21:56,041 --> 01:21:59,540
Is this any way to treat a father
who came to see his daughter?

1005
01:21:59,708 --> 01:22:02,374
You are very ungrateful.

1006
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,540
That does not work on me anymore.

1007
01:22:10,291 --> 01:22:13,332
The last time you pulled
that trick, my ring

1008
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:15,957
was gone with your departure.

1009
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,124
I know I'm a bad father.

1010
01:22:23,291 --> 01:22:26,290
Everything is my fault.

1011
01:22:29,333 --> 01:22:30,999
You, a father?

1012
01:22:31,291 --> 01:22:34,957
You steal the money I earn
from selling my body.

1013
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:38,415
I don't think of you as a father.

1014
01:22:39,416 --> 01:22:40,707
I'm going.

1015
01:22:41,625 --> 01:22:44,249
And never come back!

1016
01:22:53,333 --> 01:22:56,249
Mari, your poor father is crying.

1017
01:22:57,791 --> 01:23:00,374
No, it's just theatre.

1018
01:23:00,958 --> 01:23:02,582
I'll not bother you anymore.

1019
01:23:03,166 --> 01:23:05,540
Take care of yourself.

1020
01:23:20,625 --> 01:23:22,625
Now, you are crying.

1021
01:23:23,166 --> 01:23:24,499
Poor thing.

1022
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:44,915
<i>Rotgut

1023
01:23:51,125 --> 01:23:54,457
Barkeeper, another one!

1024
01:24:00,625 --> 01:24:05,290
It's not my fault that we lost the war.

1025
01:24:27,708 --> 01:24:30,124
She thinks she's an American ...

1026
01:24:31,916 --> 01:24:33,124
Hey, you!

1027
01:24:33,458 --> 01:24:35,707
What are you looking at?

1028
01:24:35,875 --> 01:24:37,540
Hey! Leave us alone!

1029
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:40,999
Stop drooling!

1030
01:24:41,166 --> 01:24:43,874
We are the dolls of the Yanks!

1031
01:24:49,208 --> 01:24:50,915
Learn that lesson!

1032
01:24:54,125 --> 01:24:56,915
Joe, let's drink.

1033
01:24:57,083 --> 01:24:58,582
I want to get drunk.

1034
01:25:00,666 --> 01:25:05,749
<i>♫ I read my future ♫

1035
01:25:06,333 --> 01:25:10,749
<i>♫ in the stream of stars ♫

1036
01:25:26,041 --> 01:25:29,665
You drink during the day?
Business must be good!

1037
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:33,540
This season the rain
exceeded the limits.

1038
01:25:34,125 --> 01:25:38,957
How's the Yank ... Joe, right?

1039
01:25:40,583 --> 01:25:43,707
That bastard is back in America.

1040
01:25:44,250 --> 01:25:45,957
He fucked me.

1041
01:25:46,875 --> 01:25:49,332
He has a wife and children there.

1042
01:25:50,166 --> 01:25:53,499
So you drown your sorrows in alcohol?

1043
01:26:02,958 --> 01:26:04,624
Good-bye!

1044
01:26:05,583 --> 01:26:08,082
I don't care about the future!

1045
01:26:08,958 --> 01:26:12,124
All men are dirty perverts!

1046
01:26:28,291 --> 01:26:31,415
Mariko, stop!
You are hurting yourself.

1047
01:26:31,583 --> 01:26:33,082
Why do you interfere?

1048
01:26:33,375 --> 01:26:37,124
Do not play father now.

1049
01:26:41,583 --> 01:26:43,040
What are you doing, Mariko!

1050
01:26:46,833 --> 01:26:48,499
Stop it!

1051
01:27:34,708 --> 01:27:36,540
That is more like it.

1052
01:27:38,250 --> 01:27:41,332
I don't need a family.

1053
01:27:43,125 --> 01:27:45,624
This is just a man, like any other.

1054
01:27:47,291 --> 01:27:48,832
Good-bye.

1055
01:28:45,666 --> 01:28:48,624
I'm now 75 years old.

1056
01:28:51,583 --> 01:28:54,415
I don't know if I still have the energy

1057
01:28:54,583 --> 01:28:59,249
to give birth to numerous works,

1058
01:28:59,833 --> 01:29:03,374
but I'd like to draw new worlds, again.
