1
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,810
What are we waiting for?

2
00:00:35,016 --> 00:00:36,643
Get him now!

3
00:00:57,244 --> 00:00:58,074
Come on!

4
00:01:00,242 --> 00:01:01,607
Come on, move!

5
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:07,227
That 'hurts!

6
00:01:10,117 --> 00:01:11,982
- Pull it.
- Come on!

7
00:01:13,434 --> 00:01:14,458
Go!

8
00:01:29,751 --> 00:01:31,548
Stop! Stop!

9
00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:55,973
- What has this man done?
- He pinched a horse.

10
00:01:56,246 --> 00:01:57,838
He stole a horse.

11
00:01:58,215 --> 00:02:01,844
- No offence, pastor.
- You can't do that! There's no charge.

12
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,956
Ain't necessary! We busted him.

13
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,958
You can't hang him for stealing horses.

14
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:10,619
See, desperado.
The preacher is defending you.

15
00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:13,749
Who knew that a man of God
defend see someone like you.

16
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,302
Let the preacher pray for this bastard.

17
00:02:18,673 --> 00:02:20,470
But we'll hang him first!

18
00:02:40,198 --> 00:02:42,342
Go with God, my son.

19
00:02:42,434 --> 00:02:44,962
You'll soon be face to face with him.

20
00:02:45,571 --> 00:02:49,524
Pray for His forgiveness!
For your self!

21
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,815
- And for them.
- Get out of here, Preacher.

22
00:02:52,913 --> 00:02:54,403
I don't want to pray.

23
00:02:54,615 --> 00:02:57,859
He'll be fine in hell when I get through.

24
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,374
It can't be a bit worse than here.

25
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,351
Go on, get it over with.

26
00:03:03,325 --> 00:03:06,317
Thou shalt not steal,
isn't that what the Bible says?

27
00:03:10,667 --> 00:03:11,759
Preacher?

28
00:03:13,738 --> 00:03:16,129
One minute, preacher.

29
00:03:16,942 --> 00:03:19,886
- Give me the Bible.
- Thanks to the God!

30
00:03:20,179 --> 00:03:23,148
- At the right time.
- On time!

31
00:03:23,249 --> 00:03:26,650
It's no use all going through this.
It's just a waste of time!

32
00:03:27,477 --> 00:03:32,108
All right, make it quick, preacher.
Gotta hang him anyhow, bastard start praying.

33
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,618
Hallelujah!

34
00:03:34,429 --> 00:03:38,743
Praise the Lord showing you
the path of salvation.

35
00:03:39,335 --> 00:03:43,216
The Almighty will hear
your prayers and be with you

36
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,984
in your hours of needs.

37
00:03:45,542 --> 00:03:49,913
The string is going tighter,
so repent, my son.

38
00:03:50,181 --> 00:03:54,056
Repent and God will save you!

39
00:03:55,087 --> 00:03:56,816
Yes, repent!

40
00:03:57,022 --> 00:04:00,842
That you may be forgiven for your sins.

41
00:04:01,194 --> 00:04:04,582
In a moment you will be in peace.

42
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,838
And know the joys of everlasting life.

43
00:04:09,237 --> 00:04:10,397
Proceed...

44
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:51,883
THE DIRTY OUTLAWS

45
00:07:20,299 --> 00:07:22,631
Do you have a smoke Jonathan?

46
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:36,164
What have you done these past two years?
Where've you been?

47
00:07:37,163 --> 00:07:40,465
- Here and there...
- Something interesting?

48
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,681
I just lived.

49
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:46,497
Where're you going now?

50
00:07:47,108 --> 00:07:48,473
Away from here.

51
00:07:49,043 --> 00:07:52,336
- Always alone, he?
- Sure, I always go alone!

52
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,048
That's only Confederates retreating.

53
00:08:01,158 --> 00:08:03,573
Why not come with me to Calin?

54
00:08:03,828 --> 00:08:08,446
Certain churches there are filled
with gold waiting for us to take.

55
00:08:08,734 --> 00:08:09,792
No.

56
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:12,799
Here.

57
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,515
Think it over.

58
00:08:15,842 --> 00:08:19,901
You won't live long if you go
risking a life for a horse.

59
00:08:20,647 --> 00:08:22,670
I might die, but I do it alone.

60
00:08:24,052 --> 00:08:29,398
Reverend, with all due respect, the
Major would be obliged if you come with us.

61
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:33,554
- Some of our boys are wounded badly.
- Sure...

62
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:42,717
- I don't have the Good book with me.
- A little comfort is what they need.

63
00:08:43,874 --> 00:08:46,099
Good journey, preacher!

64
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,110
Give me... your horse.

65
00:10:35,274 --> 00:10:36,502
Bury me.

66
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:39,281
Don't leave me to the buzzards.

67
00:10:40,647 --> 00:10:41,978
Please, mister.

68
00:10:43,784 --> 00:10:45,979
I have no time.

69
00:10:46,454 --> 00:10:48,217
You will not have to wait long.

70
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:51,583
Take my gun.

71
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,170
If you ever get to a place called Overton,
give it to my father.

72
00:10:58,067 --> 00:11:00,659
He is blind...

73
00:11:00,871 --> 00:11:02,716
but he sees with his hands.

74
00:11:02,739 --> 00:11:05,535
Sam Flannigan... is my father.

75
00:11:06,511 --> 00:11:07,637
Overton is...

76
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:10,504
...about 75 miles north away.

77
00:11:10,551 --> 00:11:12,554
It is a ghost town now.

78
00:11:12,654 --> 00:11:15,039
Only my father lives there.

79
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:31,793
We were going... to buy
a ranch with that money.

80
00:11:35,345 --> 00:11:37,250
You said Overton?

81
00:11:38,983 --> 00:11:41,949
Father! Leave Overton!

82
00:11:42,219 --> 00:11:43,743
Buy the rancho!

83
00:11:44,923 --> 00:11:47,258
Use the money I sent you.

84
00:11:48,526 --> 00:11:50,130
That's what's it for.

85
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,761
The ranch.

86
00:11:53,566 --> 00:11:55,033
Buy the rancho.

87
00:11:55,669 --> 00:11:57,398
I want you to...

88
00:11:58,038 --> 00:12:03,269
do well... won't you for me...

89
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,516
There is not soul inside.

90
00:13:25,608 --> 00:13:28,159
Sure, they sent us to a ghost town.

91
00:13:28,245 --> 00:13:33,092
They sent us because nobody is in and
you're surprised by no one around here?

92
00:13:33,285 --> 00:13:35,014
Well, let's have a look.

93
00:13:43,997 --> 00:13:48,590
This place is the western gold rush towns
they wrote about in the papers back home.

94
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:51,527
Come on, you let me know how to read now?

95
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,900
Well, maybe somebody read me the stories.

96
00:13:57,912 --> 00:13:58,901
Over there!

97
00:14:22,809 --> 00:14:24,208
You hear that?

98
00:14:24,545 --> 00:14:26,562
Two soldiers of the cavalry.

99
00:14:26,948 --> 00:14:29,928
Why don't you call them?
Might want to talk with us!

100
00:14:30,085 --> 00:14:32,430
But they didn't stop, they went on by.

101
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:38,214
And besides they were both so ugly,
neither of them could've been Bill.

102
00:14:38,261 --> 00:14:40,058
Maybe I exaggerated.

103
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:43,929
You're tired of me hearing
talking about him, aren't you?

104
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:48,382
No, I think it's wonderful to hear
someone talk about the person he loves.

105
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,309
I always reckon...

106
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:54,496
if one our soldiers have news of Bill.

107
00:14:55,048 --> 00:14:56,921
Tell me the truth, Katy.

108
00:14:57,751 --> 00:15:02,082
Is it true that the South was defeated
and they want to stop the fighting?

109
00:15:03,557 --> 00:15:05,320
Now tell me everything.

110
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:10,770
In Tolville Sam, when I delivered the two
revolvers, they said they were worthless.

111
00:15:10,867 --> 00:15:13,537
And that now you'd better off
making safe and hedges.

112
00:15:13,603 --> 00:15:14,729
Certainly

113
00:15:16,273 --> 00:15:19,520
So they can get those guns at $10 a piece.

114
00:15:22,013 --> 00:15:23,632
If we had Bill,

115
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,118
they'd respect us more.

116
00:15:27,437 --> 00:15:31,181
You had to pick the most bad house to stay in?

117
00:15:31,457 --> 00:15:33,288
It's no worse than the others.

118
00:15:40,868 --> 00:15:44,299
But if the cholera epidemic was over,
why there ain't anybody here now?

119
00:15:44,392 --> 00:15:46,451
Because the Yankees will get here soon,

120
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,065
and that scares more than cholera.

121
00:16:01,426 --> 00:16:03,830
You start the fire.
I'll get the rifles.

122
00:16:15,577 --> 00:16:16,976
It sucks.

123
00:16:17,906 --> 00:16:20,708
This is no town, it's a swamp.

124
00:16:32,363 --> 00:16:35,513
Sam!  Sam!

125
00:16:47,013 --> 00:16:48,310
Sam Flannigan!

126
00:16:59,194 --> 00:17:00,252
Sam!

127
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,197
Sam!

128
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:06,032
Sam Flannigan!

129
00:17:10,342 --> 00:17:12,037
It's me! Bill!

130
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:14,714
Hey, Bill?

131
00:17:34,256 --> 00:17:35,689
Is that you, Bill?

132
00:17:36,772 --> 00:17:37,761
Bill!

133
00:17:43,047 --> 00:17:47,178
- Why don't you answer?
- Yes. It's me here.

134
00:17:47,495 --> 00:17:48,587
My son.

135
00:18:08,777 --> 00:18:10,765
Welcome back, son.

136
00:18:11,784 --> 00:18:13,417
Come inside your house.

137
00:18:20,092 --> 00:18:21,684
You're home again!

138
00:18:31,328 --> 00:18:33,387
Everything is just as it was.

139
00:18:35,034 --> 00:18:36,524
Please, Katy.

140
00:18:43,671 --> 00:18:45,571
Tell me, why you're so different?

141
00:18:46,207 --> 00:18:50,300
I want to hear about everything that
happened to you all these years.

142
00:18:50,313 --> 00:18:52,281
I hardly know you.

143
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,866
Here. I still have this you gave me.

144
00:19:04,897 --> 00:19:06,023
Yes.

145
00:19:22,084 --> 00:19:25,257
You know Bill, three years is a long time.

146
00:19:28,453 --> 00:19:29,545
Thanks.

147
00:19:30,427 --> 00:19:31,792
I am Katy.

148
00:19:32,263 --> 00:19:34,473
I often wrote to you about her, Bill.

149
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:39,027
I haven't received any letters
from home for a long time.

150
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,141
Katy is my right hand.
She does everything for me.

151
00:19:44,644 --> 00:19:46,976
Takes my work and travels around making sales.

152
00:19:47,714 --> 00:19:50,182
Her folks all died from the cholera.

153
00:19:50,551 --> 00:19:53,278
- You're not wounded, are you Bill?
- No.

154
00:19:53,287 --> 00:19:54,811
Tell me the truth, Katy.

155
00:19:54,823 --> 00:19:56,313
The truth.

156
00:19:57,893 --> 00:19:59,474
No, he's not injured.

157
00:20:01,964 --> 00:20:05,482
You see I was right not to leave
Overton with the other folks.

158
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:09,047
I knew I should've waited for you.

159
00:20:09,106 --> 00:20:10,853
If I had not as expected,

160
00:20:11,042 --> 00:20:12,894
I'd rather die here in our house.

161
00:20:25,626 --> 00:20:28,016
What is this what I'm eating?

162
00:20:29,097 --> 00:20:31,439
You'd better off not looking at it.

163
00:20:39,442 --> 00:20:41,103
How much gold'll there be on that wagon?

164
00:20:42,378 --> 00:20:46,075
I do not know. Heard that it was
salary of two months of the division.

165
00:20:46,683 --> 00:20:48,947
Figure it out. I can't.

166
00:20:51,089 --> 00:20:52,784
Two rebel rats like us.

167
00:20:55,227 --> 00:20:56,421
And all that gold.

168
00:21:04,505 --> 00:21:07,435
- Is the war going bad for us, son?
- Yes.

169
00:21:08,443 --> 00:21:11,058
It is not. It's going very bad.

170
00:21:13,349 --> 00:21:15,517
As soon as it's over we buy the ranch.

171
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,114
- You remember that.
- Yes, the ranch.

172
00:21:25,496 --> 00:21:27,760
You haven't spend it, have you?

173
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,662
What?

174
00:21:30,936 --> 00:21:32,233
The money.

175
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,365
How could you even say such
a thing to your father, son?

176
00:21:36,476 --> 00:21:39,645
It's all there!
I even added a bit to of myself.

177
00:21:39,813 --> 00:21:41,728
Is it in a safe place?

178
00:21:41,983 --> 00:21:45,800
The very place you chose.
That flour mill in Russels.

179
00:21:45,821 --> 00:21:51,896
But one place is as good as another.
Who would look for that many on Overton nowadays?

180
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,556
But enough of that.
Tell me about yourself, son.

181
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:57,970
I wanna hear all that's happened.

182
00:21:58,268 --> 00:22:01,016
Not just now. It brings bad memories.

183
00:22:02,206 --> 00:22:05,558
And now... now I'm tired.

184
00:22:05,576 --> 00:22:07,680
We'll be talking more about it, tomorrow.

185
00:22:09,181 --> 00:22:10,375
Goodnight.

186
00:22:11,918 --> 00:22:14,402
- Goodnight, son.
- Goodnight.

187
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:52,430
Maybe I'm unfair to him.

188
00:22:54,002 --> 00:22:55,196
I don't know.

189
00:22:57,272 --> 00:23:00,139
- He has mighty changed.
- It's the war.

190
00:23:00,142 --> 00:23:02,315
It is the war that makes it like that.

191
00:23:02,378 --> 00:23:05,963
When it's all over, he'll be
just the way it was before.

192
00:24:36,623 --> 00:24:38,352
Are you still awake?

193
00:24:43,498 --> 00:24:47,237
When I'm really tired,
I can't sleep. And you?

194
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:52,268
- I saw the light...
- I wanted to make sure that father's money...

195
00:24:52,608 --> 00:24:54,337
was still where I'd hidden it.

196
00:24:55,579 --> 00:24:58,100
I know. I've been guarding the money.

197
00:25:11,998 --> 00:25:14,029
Am I like you'd have imagined me?

198
00:25:14,902 --> 00:25:16,233
Tell me the truth.

199
00:25:20,876 --> 00:25:22,288
I understand.

200
00:25:22,777 --> 00:25:24,142
I'm different.

201
00:25:25,013 --> 00:25:26,139
But...

202
00:25:26,649 --> 00:25:28,319
Better or worse?

203
00:25:30,653 --> 00:25:31,997
I don't know.

204
00:26:31,659 --> 00:26:32,523
Let's go.

205
00:26:33,428 --> 00:26:35,453
Remember, no killing.

206
00:26:35,763 --> 00:26:38,959
Right, they are more useful alive.

207
00:28:37,474 --> 00:28:38,668
Tie them up.

208
00:28:55,896 --> 00:29:00,026
So you're... the ones sent to
receive the gold here?

209
00:29:10,947 --> 00:29:12,312
Are you the one?

210
00:29:13,216 --> 00:29:15,241
Are there more soldiers in town?

211
00:29:49,993 --> 00:29:51,358
All right.

212
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:46,986
The horses!

213
00:31:38,223 --> 00:31:39,540
Confederates.

214
00:32:12,195 --> 00:32:14,163
I guess we're not the only people in town.

215
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,091
I saw two soldiers going through today.

216
00:32:18,535 --> 00:32:20,400
But I didn't expect them to stop.

217
00:32:25,177 --> 00:32:26,269
Listen.

218
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:28,170
Get my father's money.

219
00:32:58,083 --> 00:32:59,778
You gonna take it away?

220
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:02,577
It will be safer with me.

221
00:33:06,726 --> 00:33:08,023
Come out of there!

222
00:33:10,198 --> 00:33:13,239
Throw down your gun and come out.

223
00:33:14,069 --> 00:33:15,593
You and the girl, out.

224
00:33:32,289 --> 00:33:33,483
You stay out of sight.

225
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:45,817
Throw us your gun and come out of there!

226
00:34:18,043 --> 00:34:19,581
The desperado...

227
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:27,542
Steve Belasco. The Terror of Texas.

228
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:31,388
It's all right, he's a friend.

229
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:35,826
Hey, you had so many amigos, Lucy
how you can remember them all?

230
00:34:39,101 --> 00:34:40,735
I know him well.

231
00:34:41,939 --> 00:34:45,163
Very well. He's a skunk.

232
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,990
We teamed up for a while.

233
00:34:47,979 --> 00:34:51,948
I was teamed up with him.
So I know him very well.

234
00:34:52,019 --> 00:34:55,912
So then, he's no a real soldier.

235
00:34:55,955 --> 00:34:57,616
Steve, a soldier?

236
00:35:00,361 --> 00:35:02,955
So you're the famous desperado.

237
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,033
You're not alone.

238
00:35:08,404 --> 00:35:11,669
Who's in there with you?
The girl in there! Who is she?

239
00:35:12,141 --> 00:35:13,665
What do you care?

240
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,017
Pick up his gun, Togo.

241
00:35:37,071 --> 00:35:38,402
Search there.

242
00:35:51,622 --> 00:35:52,816
Togo!

243
00:36:03,966 --> 00:36:05,695
Nothing. The girl ain't there.

244
00:36:11,911 --> 00:36:12,935
No one.

245
00:36:13,013 --> 00:36:17,912
I judge by this masquerade that
you wait for the that military wagon, too.

246
00:36:18,553 --> 00:36:19,986
Right, Steve?

247
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:25,890
What else?

248
00:36:26,762 --> 00:36:29,230
We are all in the same boat.

249
00:36:35,405 --> 00:36:37,330
A pity I have to split with you.

250
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:59,261
Take the soldiers inside.

251
00:37:01,504 --> 00:37:03,945
There should be a blind man in town.

252
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:08,098
That's right. Over there.

253
00:37:14,953 --> 00:37:16,944
You better leave the blind man alone.

254
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:19,587
And why?

255
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:23,761
If the soldiers arrive and know about him,

256
00:37:23,896 --> 00:37:25,659
they'll wonder where he is.

257
00:37:28,035 --> 00:37:30,526
Steve always has the last word.

258
00:37:32,807 --> 00:37:34,741
You better all get used to it.

259
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:05,784
If you wanna go in there you
will have to kill me first.

260
00:38:06,013 --> 00:38:07,605
She lives with the blind man.

261
00:38:08,048 --> 00:38:09,777
She'll stay with us now.

262
00:38:11,019 --> 00:38:13,186
So that's what you were doing in the mill.

263
00:38:13,455 --> 00:38:16,405
You always want to mix business with pleasure.

264
00:39:05,016 --> 00:39:08,429
What is wrong with you?
Why don't you speak to me?

265
00:39:09,622 --> 00:39:12,275
Say something sweet to me, girl.

266
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:15,850
Come on, let me hear your little voice.

267
00:39:31,141 --> 00:39:35,572
Even if you manage to get the gold,
they'll catch you afterwards.

268
00:39:36,621 --> 00:39:38,350
You wanna hang?

269
00:39:44,563 --> 00:39:47,154
You're all be hanged by that time.

270
00:40:04,887 --> 00:40:06,445
Where did you find him?

271
00:40:07,991 --> 00:40:09,618
What difference does it make?

272
00:40:12,529 --> 00:40:14,087
I needed someone.

273
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:18,802
Why did you disappear that way, Steve?

274
00:40:19,305 --> 00:40:20,772
And without a word!

275
00:40:23,609 --> 00:40:26,339
You can't always choose the way
you have to do something.

276
00:40:29,984 --> 00:40:31,315
I missed you.

277
00:40:36,525 --> 00:40:41,357
James! Jake! One of you head to the north of
the town, the other head to the south. Go.

278
00:40:48,372 --> 00:40:49,839
It won't be long now.

279
00:40:55,113 --> 00:40:56,546
Stay wake.

280
00:40:57,416 --> 00:40:58,906
And watch for that wagon.

281
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:01,343
Katy!

282
00:41:04,691 --> 00:41:05,680
Katy!

283
00:41:07,996 --> 00:41:09,293
Get him out of the way.

284
00:41:10,565 --> 00:41:12,192
And no tricks here.

285
00:41:20,276 --> 00:41:22,400
- Katy?
- Yes, it's me.

286
00:41:23,546 --> 00:41:26,031
I've been listening to them.
Who are they're there about?

287
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,415
Troublemakers? I wonder what they're about?

288
00:41:30,722 --> 00:41:33,273
You think we should wake up Bill?

289
00:41:34,426 --> 00:41:38,458
No, we better let Bill sleep.
Let's go home, Sam.

290
00:41:39,468 --> 00:41:42,950
They're musicians who will
spend the night at the saloon.

291
00:41:54,817 --> 00:41:58,374
Strange. It's been months since
we seen a stray animal here.

292
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:03,585
- And now, all of a sudden...
- Sam, try to get some rest.

293
00:42:03,995 --> 00:42:06,225
I'm going back to the saloon and
make the visitors comfortable.

294
00:42:54,187 --> 00:42:56,481
You bought me this comb, remember?

295
00:42:57,325 --> 00:43:00,159
- No.
- You don't remember?

296
00:43:05,734 --> 00:43:07,429
Did I age too much?

297
00:43:08,571 --> 00:43:10,634
Tell me the truth. Say the truth.

298
00:43:11,211 --> 00:43:12,371
No!

299
00:43:17,014 --> 00:43:17,946
No!

300
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,324
No!

301
00:43:59,064 --> 00:44:01,772
You'd not have to bother,
I would kill him with this.

302
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:18,182
Calm down, Togo. Just wait.

303
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:21,390
At Redrock there'll be plenty of ladies for you.

304
00:44:50,291 --> 00:44:53,624
That wagon is heading this way, Asher.

305
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:59,566
Quick, untie them.

306
00:44:59,802 --> 00:45:01,269
Give them a hand.

307
00:45:14,487 --> 00:45:17,183
- There'll be a storm in here.
- That explains your temper.

308
00:45:18,959 --> 00:45:23,396
The day is getting hotter.
But it is the best climate for a long time.

309
00:45:24,065 --> 00:45:29,401
Last year, well this time and well
also that time of day,

310
00:45:29,972 --> 00:45:33,203
took me a damn Yankee this arm with one shot.

311
00:45:34,333 --> 00:45:37,657
You think they've a Christian burial
for my arm?

312
00:45:38,648 --> 00:45:40,445
That must be the town there.

313
00:45:47,826 --> 00:45:49,885
They won't last long if they try anything.

314
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:43,224
Good morning, sir.

315
00:46:46,295 --> 00:46:48,422
We weren't expecting no officers, sir.

316
00:46:49,031 --> 00:46:50,862
The area is full of deserters.

317
00:46:51,235 --> 00:46:54,398
They don't want to lose this wagon.
I was sent to command this escort.

318
00:46:54,638 --> 00:46:58,125
That's you business, sir, but
I'm afraid we can't stay.

319
00:46:58,143 --> 00:47:00,737
We've got to head straight back
to camp at Black River.

320
00:47:00,879 --> 00:47:04,026
We're also be needing your
horses for the ride back.

321
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:06,908
Those were the Colonel's orders, sir.

322
00:47:07,554 --> 00:47:11,419
Right. Take the horses.
There were no incidents?

323
00:47:13,127 --> 00:47:16,818
That road liked to bounce our brains loose.

324
00:47:17,064 --> 00:47:19,760
I hope nothing else bounced out of place.

325
00:47:20,035 --> 00:47:24,995
There was a change, the charging
is in bags and not in the coffin.

326
00:47:25,775 --> 00:47:26,901
Good luck, sir.

327
00:47:28,077 --> 00:47:29,544
Good luck!

328
00:48:09,994 --> 00:48:11,120
Unload it.

329
00:48:11,662 --> 00:48:14,572
That 's your job.

330
00:48:22,473 --> 00:48:23,770
Get to work soldiers.

331
00:48:31,721 --> 00:48:35,607
Well done, Steve.
There, you see how easy it was?

332
00:48:36,893 --> 00:48:39,919
The soldiers were smart.
Who would go look inside?

333
00:48:42,733 --> 00:48:45,941
- Asher, I'll get rid of the wagon.
- Right.

334
00:48:47,539 --> 00:48:49,166
No tricks in the mean time.

335
00:49:33,192 --> 00:49:34,345
Open the other!

336
00:49:58,189 --> 00:49:59,281
Hurry up!

337
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:19,176
It's got to be here!
I can't understand!

338
00:50:19,981 --> 00:50:21,573
Where is that pay roll?

339
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:23,618
That gold has got to be here!

340
00:50:24,453 --> 00:50:26,353
Maybe these two know something.

341
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:37,606
Where is that gold?

342
00:50:40,306 --> 00:50:42,424
Well, where is that gold?

343
00:50:45,745 --> 00:50:47,508
In the green sack for the horses.

344
00:51:04,409 --> 00:51:05,649
Damn it!

345
00:51:11,275 --> 00:51:12,765
Where's your friend?

346
00:51:14,212 --> 00:51:15,270
Where did he go?

347
00:51:16,181 --> 00:51:17,705
I said: where is he!

348
00:51:27,928 --> 00:51:28,952
Let's go!

349
00:53:45,992 --> 00:53:47,391
Don't shoot yet.

350
00:54:30,678 --> 00:54:32,441
Look at the bags.

351
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:44,770
The gold is here, dollars!

352
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,267
You thought of everything.

353
00:55:00,268 --> 00:55:01,598
You're real clever...

354
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:05,915
But you didn't figure...

355
00:55:05,918 --> 00:55:07,583
how well I know this part of the country.

356
00:55:07,588 --> 00:55:08,948
A lot better than you.

357
00:55:20,003 --> 00:55:22,582
Please let me go back to the old man.

358
00:55:27,912 --> 00:55:32,023
- Is he your father?
- No, but he needs me.

359
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:39,487
And Steve?

360
00:55:41,595 --> 00:55:43,256
I saw how you looked at him.

361
00:55:48,002 --> 00:55:50,792
Forget him. It's all over for him now.

362
00:55:57,881 --> 00:56:00,850
You can join the old coyote
just a soon as we leave.

363
00:56:41,199 --> 00:56:44,704
Your friend isn't a man of his word.
He's ready to take your share as well.

364
00:56:50,810 --> 00:56:51,868
Get off.

365
00:58:32,863 --> 00:58:34,660
I'll teach you...

366
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,990
Now try to get up, desperado.

367
00:59:48,019 --> 00:59:49,850
What we do with these two reds?

368
00:59:52,725 --> 00:59:53,953
Untie them.

369
00:59:55,194 --> 00:59:56,422
Let them go.

370
01:00:29,502 --> 01:00:30,696
Make tracks!

371
01:01:09,883 --> 01:01:11,851
Bunch of dirty dogs...

372
01:01:24,467 --> 01:01:28,835
- Bill, anything wrong? Where are you?
- Return at home.

373
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:30,929
Sam...

374
01:01:31,742 --> 01:01:33,284
Go back...

375
01:01:34,712 --> 01:01:37,840
What they've done to you, Bill?
Where are you, Bill?

376
01:01:41,253 --> 01:01:43,847
Answer me! What's going on?

377
01:01:49,096 --> 01:01:50,893
What did you do to my son?

378
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,865
I'll kill you if you touch him!

379
01:01:57,106 --> 01:01:58,630
What son?

380
01:02:02,712 --> 01:02:03,940
No! No!

381
01:02:05,081 --> 01:02:07,845
- Where are you?
- Come on! Shoot!

382
01:02:09,487 --> 01:02:11,219
I'm here, Grandpa! Shoot!

383
01:02:11,557 --> 01:02:13,752
- Where are you?
- Come on!

384
01:02:16,294 --> 01:02:18,228
- Shoot, old man, shoot!
- Murderers!

385
01:02:36,352 --> 01:02:39,729
- Come on, old man. Shoot!
- No, let me go!

386
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:41,280
Cowards!

387
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:45,069
- Shoot!
- No, Sam! No!

388
01:02:45,897 --> 01:02:46,955
Katy?

389
01:02:49,968 --> 01:02:52,773
- Katy, get away!
- Here we are!

390
01:02:56,042 --> 01:02:57,339
I hear you.

391
01:03:14,330 --> 01:03:16,264
Let me go!

392
01:03:34,421 --> 01:03:35,911
Where are you?

393
01:03:42,730 --> 01:03:43,754
Sam!

394
01:03:47,502 --> 01:03:48,366
Bill.

395
01:03:50,573 --> 01:03:51,840
- Bill.
- Sam!

396
01:03:51,842 --> 01:03:54,167
- Sam!
- Bill.

397
01:03:56,647 --> 01:03:58,842
Sam...

398
01:03:59,917 --> 01:04:01,680
They will pay for this.

399
01:04:03,622 --> 01:04:04,646
Sam!

400
01:04:53,914 --> 01:04:55,438
I want to kill him.

401
01:04:56,351 --> 01:04:58,512
I can't forget what he's done to me.

402
01:06:00,461 --> 01:06:01,894
To the horses.

403
01:08:00,303 --> 01:08:05,242
You can join your friend. She must love you
very much if she has the courage for that scene.

404
01:08:05,243 --> 01:08:09,838
She did a very good job.
I thought she'd killed you too.

405
01:08:17,256 --> 01:08:19,190
Leave that gun. It belonged to Sam!

406
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:22,821
I bring it back.

407
01:08:23,597 --> 01:08:24,655
Afterwards.

408
01:08:25,398 --> 01:08:27,992
He tried to defend you
and they killed him!

409
01:08:34,576 --> 01:08:37,306
The ones who killed him
are going to pay for it.

410
01:08:37,981 --> 01:08:39,846
You'll never find them again!

411
01:08:40,917 --> 01:08:43,613
Or is it only for the money?
Is that why you're after them?

412
01:08:51,063 --> 01:08:54,294
If you go north they'll capture
you in that uniform.

413
01:08:55,068 --> 01:08:56,695
But I've grown fond of it.

414
01:08:58,971 --> 01:09:01,599
Steve... they'll kill you.

415
01:09:03,009 --> 01:09:05,807
This time it's my turn to kill, Katy.

416
01:11:38,394 --> 01:11:39,486
Whiskey.

417
01:11:58,517 --> 01:12:03,486
Friends! A Confederate soldier.
You'd applaud this hero officer.

418
01:12:07,394 --> 01:12:09,294
I'm proud you got away.

419
01:12:31,089 --> 01:12:33,353
What you have against the cavalry?

420
01:12:33,493 --> 01:12:36,524
Nothing. They're fast when
it comes to retreating!

421
01:12:36,562 --> 01:12:39,030
They flee to the Yankees directly to our homes.

422
01:12:40,834 --> 01:12:46,067
Don't worry. A swine like you'd be
doing business with them in no time.

423
01:12:50,179 --> 01:12:54,317
War is an ugly affair.
Soldiers die young.

424
01:12:54,418 --> 01:12:56,681
But cowards keep right on going!

425
01:15:26,195 --> 01:15:28,527
Glad to find you girl.

426
01:15:29,766 --> 01:15:32,234
We'll have much time together tonight.

427
01:15:33,839 --> 01:15:36,831
Hey you! Wake up! Come on, wake up!

428
01:15:36,910 --> 01:15:38,434
What's the matter with you?

429
01:15:44,484 --> 01:15:46,179
Looks like he's dead.

430
01:15:46,886 --> 01:15:50,495
He's dead as a door-nail. Let's get him
out of here, gives the place a bad name.

431
01:15:51,052 --> 01:15:56,557
Now believe me friends, in times like these
you shouldn't invest your money in banks.

432
01:15:56,966 --> 01:16:00,993
Should invest your money. Invest!
It's just $0.02 a share.

433
01:16:01,538 --> 01:16:04,029
- How about you? Just two cents.
- Excuse me.

434
01:16:04,174 --> 01:16:06,904
- What's that, ma'am?
- Can you explain how much in a year?

435
01:16:07,078 --> 01:16:08,943
It's all down here in black and white.

436
01:16:09,313 --> 01:16:11,645
The Western Union railroad
doubles your money.

437
01:16:12,117 --> 01:16:15,052
- I reckon I'll take $10.
- Now that's 500 shares.

438
01:16:15,321 --> 01:16:18,085
Congratulations, ma'am!
You are now part of the railroad.

439
01:16:19,058 --> 01:16:22,858
Dollars Union, not Confederate money.
That would take $10,000 Confederates.

440
01:16:24,031 --> 01:16:27,467
Who else wants to ride the rails
progress with Western Union?

441
01:16:27,602 --> 01:16:29,035
- Thousand dollars.
- Money-Union?

442
01:16:29,771 --> 01:16:31,068
- Confederates.
- 50 Quotas.

443
01:16:31,506 --> 01:16:33,633
- I also want quotas.
- Here, ma'am.

444
01:16:39,283 --> 01:16:43,276
Talk loud, folks. Do not miss the chance to
participate in the Western Union railroad.

445
01:16:43,621 --> 01:16:47,182
Only $2 for 100 shares for the railroad.

446
01:16:47,525 --> 01:16:50,722
Remember, the future of this country
lies in the railroads.

447
01:16:51,397 --> 01:16:56,495
- So, I'll be back in a few days.
- I'll send you those warrants as soon as they'll get here.

448
01:16:57,070 --> 01:16:58,569
Excuse me, sir.

449
01:17:00,675 --> 01:17:02,700
Hello, I'll be right with you.

450
01:17:05,848 --> 01:17:08,716
- Anything else I can do for you, Judge?
- No, Sheriff. Thanks.

451
01:17:08,717 --> 01:17:10,412
- Have a good day.
- Thanks, bye.

452
01:17:11,421 --> 01:17:12,799
Let's talk inside.

453
01:17:13,457 --> 01:17:15,357
Wait for me downstairs.

454
01:17:27,340 --> 01:17:29,831
I just heard Jim was killed
in a fight at the saloon.

455
01:17:30,844 --> 01:17:32,471
No one knows who did it.

456
01:17:37,686 --> 01:17:41,309
Don't tell me that you
are all torn up by their deaths.

457
01:17:41,723 --> 01:17:44,601
No, I just hope nobody has
found out about that gold.

458
01:17:51,201 --> 01:17:53,384
I don't like this place at all.

459
01:17:54,873 --> 01:17:56,602
I've already told you that.

460
01:17:57,909 --> 01:17:59,672
Why did you wanna stop here?

461
01:18:06,519 --> 01:18:07,986
We got to get out of here quick.

462
01:18:08,792 --> 01:18:15,154
- The dead of Jim... I don't like it.
- That's too bad.

463
01:18:15,328 --> 01:18:19,662
Don't think you make me get back on that
horse and ride hundreds just to please you.

464
01:18:19,868 --> 01:18:22,710
No. This time we go by stage.

465
01:18:22,805 --> 01:18:24,773
No, thanks! I'm staying here.

466
01:18:26,810 --> 01:18:31,679
- You can't make me go with you.
- Don't say that, Lucy! Don't talk that way!

467
01:18:32,617 --> 01:18:35,711
I've told I don't want to go, I...

468
01:18:35,887 --> 01:18:38,818
You will come! Wether you want to or not!

469
01:18:40,426 --> 01:18:41,791
Well, judge?

470
01:18:43,096 --> 01:18:47,588
There's s a little confusion in
justice today, my friend.

471
01:18:48,437 --> 01:18:52,162
But I think the military must
even more confused, right?

472
01:18:54,577 --> 01:18:59,512
- It would take too long to explain.
- I understand... Sit down.

473
01:19:06,057 --> 01:19:08,218
You smell the perfume around here too?

474
01:19:11,263 --> 01:19:13,163
This place smells like gold.

475
01:19:16,636 --> 01:19:18,194
A few minutes ago

476
01:19:20,274 --> 01:19:21,969
a man left here.

477
01:19:27,749 --> 01:19:28,875
Oh yes!

478
01:19:29,618 --> 01:19:31,745
He wanted seats on my stage.

479
01:19:32,254 --> 01:19:36,401
For him, and his lady,
and two friends of him.

480
01:19:37,594 --> 01:19:39,118
What did you tell him?

481
01:19:42,066 --> 01:19:43,624
I said all right.

482
01:19:59,820 --> 01:20:02,305
I don't think he's traveling
with empty pockets.

483
01:20:05,861 --> 01:20:07,920
- Want to do the job together?
- No.

484
01:20:09,866 --> 01:20:12,167
No, the gold doesn't interest me anymore...

485
01:20:14,805 --> 01:20:15,863
Listen.

486
01:20:38,032 --> 01:20:41,523
- It's so hot here!
- The lady is not comfortable?

487
01:20:42,204 --> 01:20:43,865
Why don't you come and sit over here?

488
01:20:51,548 --> 01:20:54,016
In a little while, I wanna make
a business stop.

489
01:20:55,386 --> 01:20:56,978
We'd rather not stop, judge.

490
01:20:57,488 --> 01:20:59,562
I'm sorry, but it is important.

491
01:21:00,525 --> 01:21:02,229
Because I must wait...

492
01:21:02,694 --> 01:21:07,427
for an official who brings the warrants
for the arrest of the Asher gang.

493
01:21:11,605 --> 01:21:13,505
My friends here might be of help to you.

494
01:21:13,707 --> 01:21:16,998
They ride on later, if horses
can be found for them.

495
01:21:17,779 --> 01:21:21,517
Where we're stopping there'll be a farmer.

496
01:21:33,575 --> 01:21:37,127
- You haven't seen the judge at all?
- No.

497
01:21:37,736 --> 01:21:39,670
Two of these gentlemen
will wait for him here.

498
01:21:39,838 --> 01:21:43,535
I need to get going. They can fetch
the documents if it's there.

499
01:21:44,844 --> 01:21:46,175
Everything's settled?

500
01:21:46,281 --> 01:21:48,779
Sure. When do we get our share?

501
01:21:50,349 --> 01:21:53,807
When you finish your job here.

502
01:21:53,854 --> 01:21:56,448
Then we will divide everything up.

503
01:21:58,694 --> 01:22:01,595
- Well, I just want my horse back.
- Naturally

504
01:22:02,898 --> 01:22:05,696
In three days I'll meet you at Fort Worth.

505
01:22:06,035 --> 01:22:09,095
- Thank you for collaborating with the law.
- So long, sir.

506
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:15,001
This kind gentleman will deliver the horses.

507
01:22:15,914 --> 01:22:19,046
I'm sorry ma'am, but
there aren't any refreshments here.

508
01:22:19,051 --> 01:22:20,839
Never mind, it's not important.

509
01:22:22,455 --> 01:22:25,322
I wanna thank you too,
for your cooperation.

510
01:22:28,029 --> 01:22:28,996
So long.

511
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:25,596
No!

512
01:24:27,103 --> 01:24:28,263
No!

513
01:24:47,394 --> 01:24:48,292
No!

514
01:24:54,102 --> 01:24:56,514
No! No!... No!

515
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:19,719
Desperado... but you were dead!

516
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:38,612
Pray.

517
01:25:55,675 --> 01:25:56,972
Forgive me, Lord.

518
01:25:57,878 --> 01:26:01,746
Lord, forgive me my many sins.

519
01:26:02,850 --> 01:26:04,613
I am a miserable sinner.

520
01:26:07,988 --> 01:26:12,333
I stole and killed, but never I
killed... unarmed men, unarmed men!

521
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:14,822
Forgive me!

522
01:26:14,994 --> 01:26:17,189
Forgive me, Lord!

523
01:28:15,740 --> 01:28:18,494
Why? We're turning around.

524
01:28:25,619 --> 01:28:27,587
Maybe the driver took the wrong turn.

525
01:28:49,513 --> 01:28:52,665
You haven't done anything but looking
out of that window since we left.

526
01:29:10,572 --> 01:29:11,596
Hold it!

527
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:18,874
If you are a judge,
I'm the president of the Confederation.

528
01:29:19,287 --> 01:29:20,652
Out to rob me, he?

529
01:29:21,207 --> 01:29:23,141
First you got rid of my men.

530
01:29:24,445 --> 01:29:27,169
You're only waiting for the right moment.

531
01:29:27,469 --> 01:29:29,091
That's it, isn't it?

532
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:52,201
- Why did they stop?
- I think we arrived.

533
01:29:52,477 --> 01:29:55,810
You are wrong!
We're not across the Texas border.

534
01:30:13,701 --> 01:30:14,759
Asher!

535
01:30:19,710 --> 01:30:20,768
Hey, come back!

536
01:30:23,547 --> 01:30:25,037
Come back here, bastard!

537
01:30:35,691 --> 01:30:36,783
Asher!

538
01:31:31,394 --> 01:31:32,418
Asher!

539
01:31:59,427 --> 01:32:04,076
That gun won't help you.
That was your last bullet, Asher.

540
01:32:20,157 --> 01:32:22,787
I wouldn't want it so easy for you.

541
01:32:58,579 --> 01:33:00,966
You still have time to die like a man.

542
01:33:13,630 --> 01:33:16,231
Because you're looking death in the face.

543
01:33:21,606 --> 01:33:23,164
Are you ready?

544
01:33:39,994 --> 01:33:42,319
You really shouldn't have done that.

545
01:33:45,501 --> 01:33:47,230
Call yourself a man?

546
01:34:14,803 --> 01:34:16,828
You still have bullets, Asher.

547
01:34:22,411 --> 01:34:25,504
Try again. Go on.

548
01:34:39,232 --> 01:34:41,513
See better with mud in your eyes?

549
01:34:53,848 --> 01:34:55,771
The gun is right there. Shoot!

550
01:34:59,855 --> 01:35:00,981
Now, shoot it!

551
01:35:06,972 --> 01:35:07,870
I am here.

552
01:35:12,871 --> 01:35:13,871
Here!

553
01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:23,112
The old man couldn't see either.
Remember?

554
01:36:28,593 --> 01:36:30,151
Good day, sir.

555
01:36:32,965 --> 01:36:36,406
He was making off with our gold.
We chased him for ten days.

556
01:36:37,338 --> 01:36:40,897
I'm afraid you made a mistake.
This man is a judge, Captain.

557
01:36:41,009 --> 01:36:43,839
He was helping me, he was guarding the gold.

558
01:36:46,515 --> 01:36:48,540
There's the thief you're looking for.

559
01:36:49,686 --> 01:36:52,546
- He's a murderer as well.
- You mean...

560
01:36:53,524 --> 01:36:57,879
So he was telling the truth.
He is really a judge!

561
01:36:58,763 --> 01:37:00,196
Untie him. Hurry!

562
01:37:07,907 --> 01:37:10,239
Your Honor, please hold out your hands.

563
01:37:42,015 --> 01:37:47,047
It seems that my destiny is
to be judge. Goodbye, Steve.

564
01:37:52,394 --> 01:37:54,055
Aren't we going together, Steve?

565
01:37:56,365 --> 01:37:57,627
No, Lucy.

566
01:38:01,905 --> 01:38:03,463
I hate you, Steve.

567
01:38:05,074 --> 01:38:06,666
That's not true.

568
01:38:08,313 --> 01:38:09,610
You're right.

569
01:38:17,456 --> 01:38:19,909
Steve... good luck.

570
01:38:28,001 --> 01:38:32,700
- Captain would you escort them to Delmar?
- Yes, it will be a pleasure.

571
01:38:33,941 --> 01:38:35,306
Good luck, sir.

572
01:38:37,346 --> 01:38:40,820
Good luck to you.
Come on! Forward!

573
01:39:06,848 --> 01:39:08,815
Take the money that belonged to Sam.

574
01:39:10,619 --> 01:39:12,714
Buy a ranch of your own.

575
01:39:14,857 --> 01:39:16,481
I wish you think it over.

576
01:39:18,028 --> 01:39:20,140
There, beyond the mountain.

577
01:39:20,297 --> 01:39:21,594
It is good land.

578
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:25,389
It's what old Sam would have wanted.

579
01:39:27,672 --> 01:39:29,196
Why don't you stay?

580
01:39:33,579 --> 01:39:35,103
I can't now.

581
01:39:36,417 --> 01:39:39,580
I still have to come to terms with myself.

582
01:39:40,922 --> 01:39:42,822
Will we see each other again?

583
01:39:46,128 --> 01:39:47,686
Sure, we will.

584
01:40:09,456 --> 01:40:10,889
I will wait for you, Steve!
