1
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:21,603
And doctor?
-It's finished.

2
00:00:21,703 --> 00:00:25,124
I'm the eldest son.
-It's unacceptable... I disagree.

3
00:00:25,324 --> 00:00:27,260
A bit of dignity, please.

4
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:30,486
You've heard the deceased person's
wishes, just like I did.

5
00:00:30,686 --> 00:00:33,002
His will will be read in 200 years.

6
00:00:33,037 --> 00:00:35,135
In 200 years, why not 1000?

7
00:00:36,242 --> 00:00:37,847
Come, Marie.

8
00:00:40,581 --> 00:00:42,238
What are you doing, Marie?

9
00:00:42,463 --> 00:00:44,198
He was my uncle, after all.

10
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:46,453
Your uncle? Ah, yes.

11
00:00:54,162 --> 00:00:57,497
...amen. Right, the debt?

12
00:00:58,778 --> 00:01:00,674
Will you pay me what he owed me?

13
00:01:01,445 --> 00:01:04,471
Yes, Mr Galopin, in 200 years,
like everybody else.

14
00:01:04,571 --> 00:01:06,723
In 200 years? But I'll be dead.
-No doubt.

15
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:09,463
So?
-Have children.

16
00:01:09,663 --> 00:01:13,347
Children?
-Boys, preferably.

17
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:18,427
Boys? You're right, Mr Leboîteux.
I'll get to it.

18
00:01:39,812 --> 00:01:43,876
SOME LIKE IT COLD

19
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:02,842
Poor Mr Leboîteux...

20
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,769
Come on, children, it's over.
We're going home.

21
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:10,736
It'll be fine, it'll be fine
Aristocrats to the lamp-post!

22
00:02:10,936 --> 00:02:14,593
It'll be fine, it'll be fine
The aristocrats, we'll hang them!

23
00:02:46,735 --> 00:02:51,056
Is it Cambronne?
No Sire, it's the son of Galopin.

24
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,888
Damn!

25
00:03:24,126 --> 00:03:25,670
Leboîteux.
-Yes?

26
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,315
It's twins.
-Again!

27
00:03:30,622 --> 00:03:37,543
EIFFEL- construction site

28
00:04:07,249 --> 00:04:11,515
That's enough. I forbid you to
hit the little Leboîteux.

29
00:04:12,006 --> 00:04:14,243
But he's a pain.
-You'll understand later.

30
00:04:14,957 --> 00:04:16,815
Poor little Leboîteux.

31
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,432
And?
-It's a boy.

32
00:04:39,507 --> 00:04:43,026
Finally, saved.

33
00:05:07,426 --> 00:05:12,770
<i>For a billion
We'll do anything</i>

34
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,222
<i>For a billion
We'd scream with joy</i>

35
00:05:17,322 --> 00:05:22,738
<i>For a billion
We'll believe any lie</i>

36
00:05:22,838 --> 00:05:25,259
<i>Because with a billion
Life's very easy</i>

37
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:28,191
Albert Leboîteux
Notary.

38
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,793
Considering the big cost,
involved for me...

39
00:05:30,993 --> 00:05:33,392
I think the distribution should be
fairer.

40
00:05:34,448 --> 00:05:37,148
We said fifty-fifty.
So it'll be fifty-fifty.

41
00:05:37,274 --> 00:05:40,873
Come on, Leboîteux.
It's my idea.

42
00:05:40,951 --> 00:05:44,624
But, dear Meyer, this inheritance
is my case, isn't it?

43
00:05:45,104 --> 00:05:47,648
What about Galopin? He'll come
after me right away.

44
00:05:47,677 --> 00:05:49,865
And what will you do with
the family?

45
00:05:50,656 --> 00:05:54,035
No, believe me. Fifty-fifty.
We'll both get our share.

46
00:05:55,653 --> 00:05:58,647
But let's talk about your charity.

47
00:05:58,926 --> 00:06:00,966
It's all according to the rules.

48
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,978
No names, right?
-No.

49
00:06:03,341 --> 00:06:07,838
Benefactors always stay anonymous.
Trust me.

50
00:06:08,128 --> 00:06:12,851
Are you sure the inheritance goes to
a charity if there are no heirs?

51
00:06:13,243 --> 00:06:15,287
I'm sure, trust me.

52
00:06:16,066 --> 00:06:17,565
Is it legal?
-Absolutely.

53
00:06:18,893 --> 00:06:23,545
By the way, what are they like?

54
00:06:25,132 --> 00:06:27,397
At first glance, a mixed bunch.

55
00:06:27,856 --> 00:06:33,238
Mr Hannibal Alexandre Napoléon
Valmorin.

56
00:06:33,264 --> 00:06:36,536
Yes, sir.
-Agricultural worker.

57
00:06:36,677 --> 00:06:37,677
Yes, in Kunia.

58
00:06:37,678 --> 00:06:41,016
Excuse me?
-Kunia's my country, sir.

59
00:06:42,852 --> 00:06:49,645
Miss Anne Ingrid Valmorin from
Copenhagen, called Ava Spider.

60
00:06:51,739 --> 00:06:53,924
Cover girl.

61
00:06:54,024 --> 00:06:55,487
Actress.

62
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,532
Mr Luigi Valmorin.

63
00:06:59,818 --> 00:07:01,586
Di Valmorino.

64
00:07:01,608 --> 00:07:04,050
Excuse me, Di Valmorino.

65
00:07:04,085 --> 00:07:05,387
Grazie.

66
00:07:05,975 --> 00:07:09,254
Unemployed.
-At the moment.

67
00:07:10,283 --> 00:07:16,684
Mr William Forster Valmorin.
-Hi.

68
00:07:17,178 --> 00:07:18,558
Doorman in New York.

69
00:07:19,255 --> 00:07:23,723
Yes, doorman at the Waldorf.

70
00:07:24,223 --> 00:07:29,643
Mrs Mathilde Rouet, née Valmorin.
Farmer.

71
00:07:29,648 --> 00:07:32,134
Agriculturist.
-As you wish.

72
00:07:32,477 --> 00:07:39,030
Mr Pierre Valmorin, Montreux,
composer.

73
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,753
Present.

74
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:49,845
Mr S.B. Smith Valmorin.
-Yes, economist at the Glasgow University.

75
00:07:52,102 --> 00:07:57,479
Excuse me, Miss, but your name's
not on the list.

76
00:07:57,558 --> 00:07:59,997
She's my fiancée.

77
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:04,493
I understand, but this lady's
not related...

78
00:08:05,032 --> 00:08:10,443
and I have to ask her to leave
the room.

79
00:08:11,423 --> 00:08:15,900
Unless these ladies and
gentlemen...

80
00:08:16,144 --> 00:08:21,881
Right, Miss, please leave.

81
00:08:26,892 --> 00:08:30,291
No Meyer, fifty-fifty as agreed.
And that's it.

82
00:08:30,961 --> 00:08:36,228
The family's healthy and I want to
keep it that way.

83
00:08:36,436 --> 00:08:39,257
You take care of Galopin and
everything will be alright.

84
00:08:40,356 --> 00:08:42,097
Is he here?
-Yes.

85
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:45,158
Your turn, Meyer.

86
00:08:45,991 --> 00:08:47,818
Am I late?
-Unfortunately.

87
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:50,125
Let's not waste any time and
settle our debts.

88
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:54,497
Excuse me, dear Galopin, you'll
discuss this with colleague Meyer.

89
00:08:54,678 --> 00:08:58,307
What's the meaning of this?
-Don't worry, you'll be paid.

90
00:08:58,507 --> 00:08:59,739
Completely?
-Completely.

91
00:08:59,823 --> 00:09:01,810
With interest?
-With interest.

92
00:09:01,882 --> 00:09:04,318
It's a large amount.
-We know.

93
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,637
I have something urgent to do.

94
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:09,616
Let's waste no more time and
settle our debts.

95
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,066
Sit down, please.

96
00:09:25,437 --> 00:09:27,634
I hope you've all introduced
yourselves.

97
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:31,113
I thought it was a good idea
if you all stayed in the same hotel.

98
00:09:31,781 --> 00:09:35,995
I hope you'll enjoy your stay
in Geneva.

99
00:09:36,537 --> 00:09:39,399
Allow me to ask you one question.

100
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,842
How do you feel?

101
00:09:45,862 --> 00:09:49,880
Is everybody healthy?
Is no one sick?

102
00:09:50,086 --> 00:09:51,989
Great, that's good news.

103
00:09:53,254 --> 00:09:56,612
Let's talk about serious
matters now.

104
00:09:56,657 --> 00:09:57,894
The will.

105
00:10:08,686 --> 00:10:15,606
4 July 1759. I, Antoine Blaise
Octave, Count of La Tour...

106
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,418
Marquis of la Tour, Marquis
of Valmorin...

107
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:23,124
ask my heirs to respect my wishes
and to pay the debts...

108
00:10:24,633 --> 00:10:30,850
that my descendants and I have incurred
over the years with the Galopin family.

109
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:37,201
Don't worry, these costs are
minimal.

110
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:40,704
My colleague, Mr Meyer's working on that
as we speak.

111
00:10:41,322 --> 00:10:42,572
In your interest.

112
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,762
Wait, wait.

113
00:10:47,555 --> 00:10:48,651
But are you sure?

114
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,336
What do you mean, am I sure?

115
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:57,854
What about this, May 8 1752?
You can't deny it.

116
00:10:58,109 --> 00:11:00,264
Take it easy.
We have plenty of time.

117
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,618
But I don't.

118
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:04,274
You can't get paid until we've
found the heir.

119
00:11:04,474 --> 00:11:06,144
But who will find the heir?

120
00:11:06,344 --> 00:11:07,783
Mr Leboîteux.

121
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:12,593
Leboîteux.
I'll have to keep an eye on him too.

122
00:11:12,788 --> 00:11:18,316
Since my heirs have never tried to help
cure the disease that is killing me...

123
00:11:19,172 --> 00:11:23,258
my entire fortune will be paid in 200
years to a descendant...

124
00:11:24,595 --> 00:11:30,492
who has been declared incurably ill
by capable doctors.

125
00:11:31,093 --> 00:11:35,695
Drawn up in Valmorin Castle, in
the year of the Lord 1759.

126
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,811
Is this why we're here?
-It must be a joke.

127
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,934
Now we have to be sick to inherit.
-Did I miss a contract for this?

128
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,388
I left my business.
-I left my animals.

129
00:11:44,573 --> 00:11:46,231
This is the will.
I can't help it.

130
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:52,607
It's the will of a crazy man.
-A crazy man who bequeaths to you...

131
00:11:52,642 --> 00:11:57,462
goods, title deeds and other matters
for a total of one billion.

132
00:11:57,662 --> 00:12:00,110
One billion?
-Just about.

133
00:12:04,102 --> 00:12:06,335
What's wrong with him?
Did he faint?

134
00:12:15,982 --> 00:12:18,279
He's dead.
Heart attack.

135
00:12:19,704 --> 00:12:22,034
The poor guy didn't enjoy
his fortune for long.

136
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,958
Which fortune?
-It's clear that he inherited it.

137
00:12:25,173 --> 00:12:28,907
The poor cousin's heart's not working
anymore...

138
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,848
but we may also have things that
don't work anymore.

139
00:12:32,464 --> 00:12:35,122
A bit of respect, please.

140
00:12:35,261 --> 00:12:38,572
Based on the medical check-up,
you'll be able to judge your rights.

141
00:12:38,669 --> 00:12:40,095
If you have any.

142
00:12:40,832 --> 00:12:44,989
Now I'd like to make arrangements for
the funeral of your deceased cousin.

143
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,522
Relax, everything will be done
in your interest.

144
00:13:03,911 --> 00:13:06,223
They didn't spend much.
-He was Scottish.

145
00:13:06,235 --> 00:13:09,238
He had to pay for his own funeral.
-Look at the wreath.

146
00:13:10,058 --> 00:13:14,174
TO OUR VERY DEAR COUSIN

147
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,997
That looks serious.
-With a bit of luck...

148
00:13:24,109 --> 00:13:26,551
No, he's strong.

149
00:13:26,703 --> 00:13:30,352
Another 48 hours and he'll be dead.
-What if he lasts?

150
00:14:02,118 --> 00:14:03,730
Take a deep breath.

151
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,552
Again.

152
00:14:14,447 --> 00:14:15,868
Is it serious, doctor?

153
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,914
A benign form of bronchitis
and pulmonary emphysema.

154
00:14:21,067 --> 00:14:22,949
But a serious case.

155
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:24,978
Serious?

156
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,278
Yes, this type of bronchitis can
become chronic.

157
00:14:27,313 --> 00:14:28,440
Chronic?

158
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:35,679
Hannibal die.
Hannibal never see Kunia again.

159
00:14:35,794 --> 00:14:37,153
Yes, you will. Who's Kunia?

160
00:14:37,435 --> 00:14:38,600
That's his country.

161
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,690
Yes, you'll see your country again.

162
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,832
Kunia.

163
00:14:42,577 --> 00:14:46,180
Excuse me.
I can assure you he won't die.

164
00:14:46,275 --> 00:14:49,719
But is it serious?
-Can it be cured?

165
00:14:50,037 --> 00:14:52,253
With proper care everything's
possible.

166
00:14:52,414 --> 00:14:56,165
You can count on us.
-We'll save him.

167
00:15:10,112 --> 00:15:12,429
The thermometer.
-It's time.

168
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,752
May I, may I?

169
00:15:17,214 --> 00:15:21,853
Ladies, per favore, thermometer.

170
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:27,189
Grazie.

171
00:15:40,696 --> 00:15:42,563
Ladies, per favore.

172
00:15:44,385 --> 00:15:45,663
Grazie.

173
00:15:48,979 --> 00:15:50,398
It's terrible!

174
00:15:50,598 --> 00:15:52,138
44.

175
00:15:57,675 --> 00:16:02,125
37,6, normal.
I'm stupid.

176
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:11,788
Hannibal smoke, Hannibal burn.

177
00:16:12,483 --> 00:16:14,943
It's hurting him.
-The stronger, the better.

178
00:16:15,043 --> 00:16:17,157
But it shouldn't make holes.

179
00:16:17,257 --> 00:16:19,602
Did you use too much mustard?
-Ask Forster.

180
00:16:19,754 --> 00:16:22,714
The same as for a steak.
-A whole jar?

181
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:26,159
In America, mustard is mustard.

182
00:16:27,542 --> 00:16:29,570
Pierre, remove that right away.

183
00:16:34,586 --> 00:16:41,331
Hannibal, never see Kunia anymore.

184
00:16:42,798 --> 00:16:46,219
The thermometer, what do I do with
the thermometer?

185
00:16:47,149 --> 00:16:49,281
The thermometer.
-Put it somewhere.

186
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:50,740
Somewhere.

187
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,288
Out of my way.
Pierre, help me.

188
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:57,281
The real remedy is to relax.

189
00:16:58,115 --> 00:17:01,298
Out of my way.
Hannibal OK.

190
00:17:02,861 --> 00:17:04,625
This is unbelievable.
You're crazy.

191
00:17:04,999 --> 00:17:10,577
Why not? In America, mustard is mustard
and relax is relax.

192
00:17:11,704 --> 00:17:16,320
Relax...
-Yeah.

193
00:17:43,624 --> 00:17:46,082
That's beautiful.

194
00:17:50,259 --> 00:17:51,589
Excuse me.

195
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:56,632
Continue.

196
00:19:25,902 --> 00:19:28,167
Excuse me.

197
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:44,302
My handkerchiefs are missing.
-Handkerchiefs!

198
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:47,047
Poor Hannibal.

199
00:19:47,537 --> 00:19:54,196
I, Hannibal Alexandre Napoléon Valmorin,
claim no rights to the Valmorin fortune.

200
00:19:54,608 --> 00:19:59,350
Drawn up in Geneva, July 7 1959.
Perfect.

201
00:20:01,337 --> 00:20:03,504
Sign here.

202
00:20:07,878 --> 00:20:09,653
There.
-Perfect.

203
00:20:10,172 --> 00:20:13,039
Content?
-Hannibal happy to be healthy again.

204
00:20:13,401 --> 00:20:17,705
You're right, it's invaluable.
-Hannibal happy see Kunia again.

205
00:20:17,805 --> 00:20:19,848
Thanks to my friendly cousins.

206
00:20:20,048 --> 00:20:21,668
You fixed him up.
And fast.

207
00:20:21,868 --> 00:20:23,154
We just did our duty.

208
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:25,039
Did you also make the papers
presto?

209
00:20:25,176 --> 00:20:26,801
Yes, you were very quick.

210
00:20:27,001 --> 00:20:28,249
Thank you!

211
00:20:28,349 --> 00:20:30,395
It was nothing.
He wanted to go home.

212
00:20:30,424 --> 00:20:32,709
We couldn't force him to stay here.

213
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,625
Let's go.
-Yes.

214
00:20:35,544 --> 00:20:37,244
Cousin.

215
00:20:39,422 --> 00:20:40,549
Thanks.

216
00:20:48,604 --> 00:20:50,718
Come, you don't want to miss
your plane.

217
00:20:50,724 --> 00:20:52,173
Prego.

218
00:20:54,727 --> 00:20:57,018
Goodbye, cousins.
-Bye.

219
00:20:57,118 --> 00:21:01,543
I thought he was play-acting.
-What do you mean?

220
00:21:01,643 --> 00:21:05,385
I thought he was pretending to be ill
so he could get the inheritance.

221
00:21:05,585 --> 00:21:07,358
Pretending to be ill?

222
00:21:07,895 --> 00:21:09,707
Excuse me.

223
00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:13,059
Come, you.

224
00:21:29,835 --> 00:21:33,069
Call a doctor immediately.

225
00:21:33,269 --> 00:21:35,925
Hello, Miss, room 103.

226
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:39,511
Could you call a doctor?

227
00:21:40,256 --> 00:21:42,883
A doctor?
Mr Forster Valmorin.

228
00:21:44,622 --> 00:21:45,787
One moment.

229
00:21:46,403 --> 00:21:47,594
Immediately.

230
00:21:50,204 --> 00:21:52,060
One moment, I'll call you back.

231
00:21:55,332 --> 00:21:59,444
A doctor for Mrs Mathilde Valmorin.
I'll arrange it.

232
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:03,211
You never see any evil.
You're too naive.

233
00:22:03,514 --> 00:22:06,738
People can make up an illness.
There's always something.

234
00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:09,040
The head, the nerves, the liver.

235
00:22:09,522 --> 00:22:12,750
Sol, si... sol, si...

236
00:22:13,592 --> 00:22:17,143
There's a billion at stake and
you go "sol, si, sol, si".

237
00:22:17,477 --> 00:22:19,226
A billion.

238
00:22:20,911 --> 00:22:25,075
Mum was right. I should never have
left my pasha for this.

239
00:22:25,837 --> 00:22:29,786
Listen, I hate never knowing
what we'll eat tonight...

240
00:22:29,986 --> 00:22:33,208
while you go sol, si, sol, si.
I can't stand it any longer.

241
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,091
I'll start working on this billion,
right away.

242
00:22:37,765 --> 00:22:40,385
Hello, Miss.

243
00:22:43,536 --> 00:22:47,440
Lungs are fine, heart's excellent.
Blood pressure's normal.

244
00:22:47,652 --> 00:22:49,929
Is there no hope then, doctor?

245
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:53,589
Hope?
-I mean a small chance.

246
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,991
Because you're his wife, I guess.
-His fiancée.

247
00:22:57,191 --> 00:23:01,321
I thought you were married.
That's 30 francs.

248
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,327
Doctor.
-Thank you.

249
00:23:10,633 --> 00:23:13,410
For that money he could have
found something.

250
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:16,100
You haven't heard the last
about this.

251
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:21,618
What do you feel?

252
00:23:21,653 --> 00:23:23,300
I don't feel anything.

253
00:23:23,665 --> 00:23:25,197
Where does it hurt?

254
00:23:25,297 --> 00:23:26,712
I don't know where it hurts.

255
00:23:26,812 --> 00:23:28,149
Why did you let me come then?

256
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,165
So you could tell me where
it hurts.

257
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,355
But you have no pain.
-How do you know that?

258
00:23:32,555 --> 00:23:34,008
That's what you just said.

259
00:23:34,174 --> 00:23:36,051
I don't know if I have no pain.

260
00:23:36,661 --> 00:23:39,390
You need a specialist.

261
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:41,746
A psychiatrist.

262
00:23:42,082 --> 00:23:43,582
A psychiatrist?

263
00:23:43,782 --> 00:23:45,699
Yes, a doctor for the head.

264
00:23:45,899 --> 00:23:49,315
For the head... ah yes... insanity.

265
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:52,493
Yes, insanity.
Good night.

266
00:23:55,984 --> 00:24:00,334
Insanity, ok!

267
00:24:08,303 --> 00:24:11,277
This way, dottore.

268
00:24:14,732 --> 00:24:16,796
It's the dottore,
the good dottore.

269
00:24:18,706 --> 00:24:21,736
The patient's over there.
She's pretty ill.

270
00:24:26,463 --> 00:24:27,464
Pretty ill.

271
00:24:34,847 --> 00:24:36,101
And so is he.

272
00:24:39,099 --> 00:24:41,273
But...
-Please don't insist, Madam.

273
00:24:41,295 --> 00:24:45,784
You have fat around your heart.
Just don't do any heavy exercise.

274
00:24:46,724 --> 00:24:48,368
No heavy exercise? Alright.

275
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,022
And the spots in my eyes?

276
00:24:52,222 --> 00:24:53,579
That's your blood pressure.

277
00:24:55,012 --> 00:24:57,818
And when I don't get enough air?
-Open the window.

278
00:24:58,018 --> 00:25:03,047
And my hiccups?
-Have some water with aspirin.

279
00:25:04,124 --> 00:25:05,470
That's 30 francs.

280
00:25:11,861 --> 00:25:13,298
May I?

281
00:25:26,769 --> 00:25:28,362
This way, dottore.

282
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,017
It must be an epidemic.

283
00:25:36,765 --> 00:25:38,463
Nice room, isn't it?

284
00:25:43,846 --> 00:25:45,434
I have a migraine, doctor.

285
00:25:46,041 --> 00:25:49,453
It's meningitis.
-Meningitis, yes. Aspirin.

286
00:25:50,551 --> 00:25:52,232
Aspirin?

287
00:25:56,706 --> 00:25:59,483
How are you?
-Aspirin.

288
00:26:03,378 --> 00:26:04,927
Aspirin.

289
00:26:08,715 --> 00:26:09,902
Aspirin.

290
00:26:18,734 --> 00:26:20,197
I found it. Listen.

291
00:26:20,864 --> 00:26:25,906
Asthma, chronic disorder of the airways,
characterised by shortness of breath.

292
00:26:26,263 --> 00:26:29,047
Can have various causes.

293
00:26:29,584 --> 00:26:32,939
Cut grass, feathers, oranges,
cats, etc.

294
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,540
It tends to become chronic.

295
00:26:36,697 --> 00:26:41,675
For a billion we'll do anything.

296
00:27:39,671 --> 00:27:41,968
You're in excellent shape.
-What?

297
00:30:08,252 --> 00:30:10,678
You're hurting me.
-It's the cellulitis.

298
00:30:10,712 --> 00:30:12,637
What cellulitis?
-Yours, not mine.

299
00:30:13,053 --> 00:30:15,864
I have cellulitis?
-You'd have to be blind not to see it.

300
00:30:16,597 --> 00:30:19,260
It's not skin, it's a sieve.
-Get rid of it right away.

301
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,193
We're not at the cleaner's, missus.

302
00:30:21,206 --> 00:30:24,350
You can't just remove cellulitis.
Especially your persistent type.

303
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:28,687
Persistent? So it's incurable.

304
00:30:29,109 --> 00:30:30,497
Pretty much.

305
00:30:31,662 --> 00:30:33,321
Incurable.

306
00:30:37,065 --> 00:30:42,698
Incurable, take your hands off me.
This is wonderful.

307
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:47,827
Incurable, I'm incurable.
It's wonderful.

308
00:30:48,842 --> 00:30:51,493
She's incurable alright.

309
00:30:57,836 --> 00:31:02,654
DEAFNESS
IS IT INCURABLE

310
00:31:07,244 --> 00:31:09,503
Henry, Henry!

311
00:31:14,705 --> 00:31:18,842
Hallo, sheriff, have you seen
my horse?

312
00:31:18,852 --> 00:31:20,317
It's a quarter past three.

313
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:23,256
I didn't ask what time it was.
I'm looking for my horse.

314
00:31:23,973 --> 00:31:26,301
Flatterer.
-A horse with blue eyes.

315
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:29,424
Speak louder.
-Why? Are you deaf?

316
00:31:29,494 --> 00:31:32,908
That's unreasonable.
Never between meals.

317
00:31:36,004 --> 00:31:41,056
Hello.
-Cousin, I see happiness in your eyes.

318
00:31:41,494 --> 00:31:42,902
Why are you so cheerful?

319
00:31:43,081 --> 00:31:44,437
Because of this.

320
00:31:50,715 --> 00:31:52,379
So you're looking for your horse?

321
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:54,310
Yes, did you find it?

322
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:56,428
Yes, I saw it in the street.

323
00:31:56,468 --> 00:31:58,422
It was mailing some letters.

324
00:32:00,003 --> 00:32:01,434
Mr Pierre Valmorin.

325
00:32:01,692 --> 00:32:04,651
Room 108, first floor.
-Excuse me.

326
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,059
They've been there for half
an hour.

327
00:32:18,259 --> 00:32:21,497
Well doctor, is it serious?
-Chronic asthma.

328
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:23,053
Chronic!

329
00:32:29,431 --> 00:32:32,202
What? Yes, Commissioner.

330
00:32:33,136 --> 00:32:35,864
Forster Valmorin, yes he's a client
of mine.

331
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,899
No.

332
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:40,914
Yes, I'm going right away.

333
00:32:41,114 --> 00:32:43,293
Yes, I'll inform the family.

334
00:32:53,205 --> 00:33:00,424
We found him half naked with this
feather, and not on his head.

335
00:33:00,638 --> 00:33:01,868
He...
-Yes.

336
00:33:04,659 --> 00:33:06,140
In Geneva.

337
00:33:06,727 --> 00:33:08,821
Yes, you must understand.

338
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:12,157
We can't let him walk around
freely.

339
00:33:12,317 --> 00:33:13,726
Of course not.

340
00:33:14,655 --> 00:33:18,657
He's ill.
You see what I mean.

341
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:26,163
I do, I do.
Insanity.

342
00:33:28,395 --> 00:33:30,174
I think I can make arrangements.

343
00:33:30,658 --> 00:33:33,952
Can you keep him for 48 hours?
-48 hours?

344
00:33:34,106 --> 00:33:39,338
Forster needs to undergo a medical
because of a will I'm working on.

345
00:33:39,455 --> 00:33:45,827
Unfortunately, that has to happen within
48 hours, do you understand?

346
00:33:45,831 --> 00:33:50,414
Yes, I do.
-That's it.

347
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:00,626
Alright, Mr Leboîteux, I'm counting
on you.

348
00:34:00,685 --> 00:34:02,026
You can.

349
00:34:08,011 --> 00:34:09,960
With a feather?

350
00:34:45,352 --> 00:34:46,356
EYE DISORDERS

351
00:34:46,556 --> 00:34:47,888
Next.

352
00:35:03,108 --> 00:35:04,263
Occupied.

353
00:35:09,336 --> 00:35:11,367
Did I hear someone knock?

354
00:35:16,012 --> 00:35:21,193
100% deaf.

355
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:25,601
You can go.

356
00:35:28,946 --> 00:35:32,787
You can go, it's finished.

357
00:36:06,133 --> 00:36:07,573
Next.

358
00:36:11,791 --> 00:36:13,077
Actor.

359
00:36:28,306 --> 00:36:29,721
Va bene.

360
00:37:19,724 --> 00:37:21,298
An X-ray that's worth gold

361
00:37:21,661 --> 00:37:24,304
Are you sure it's a serious illness?
-He's dead.

362
00:37:24,504 --> 00:37:27,632
He's dead? Grazie, mille grazie.

363
00:37:27,799 --> 00:37:29,144
And my fur coat?

364
00:37:29,244 --> 00:37:32,324
Your fur coat?
You'll have 1, 2, 3, 4 fur coats.

365
00:37:32,351 --> 00:37:35,160
You'll see how happy we'll
be when we'll have a billion.

366
00:37:35,376 --> 00:37:38,514
Are you happy, darling?
-Yes.

367
00:38:59,596 --> 00:39:01,047
What are you doing here?

368
00:39:01,128 --> 00:39:02,778
I'm clumsy.

369
00:39:03,206 --> 00:39:05,510
Never mind, hurry.
There's an emergency.

370
00:39:06,332 --> 00:39:08,128
An emergency?
Grazie.

371
00:40:13,354 --> 00:40:15,600
What a job. We're never finished.

372
00:40:15,944 --> 00:40:17,722
We're about to operate.

373
00:40:19,603 --> 00:40:21,468
Are you replacing the intern?

374
00:40:29,521 --> 00:40:30,828
Do we know each other?

375
00:40:31,825 --> 00:40:33,491
Have we worked together before?

376
00:40:35,062 --> 00:40:36,802
Have you operated before?

377
00:40:39,511 --> 00:40:41,691
I'm sure we've met before.

378
00:40:43,881 --> 00:40:45,867
It'll come to me. Let's go.

379
00:40:50,007 --> 00:40:52,153
Have you prepared a room?
-Not yet, doctor.

380
00:40:52,353 --> 00:40:53,871
Go get the sheets.

381
00:41:09,998 --> 00:41:11,049
Scalpel.

382
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:36,385
Retractor.

383
00:41:52,961 --> 00:41:54,214
Ligature needle.

384
00:42:13,612 --> 00:42:14,848
Scissors.

385
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:29,771
Young people... no spine.

386
00:42:33,779 --> 00:42:35,997
I feel sick.

387
00:42:37,057 --> 00:42:38,390
I feel sick.

388
00:42:44,696 --> 00:42:47,875
Hello? Miss?

389
00:42:49,378 --> 00:42:51,036
Is the doctor coming soon?

390
00:42:51,082 --> 00:42:52,955
He'll be there in a minute, sir.

391
00:42:53,757 --> 00:42:55,627
He had an emergency in the clinic.

392
00:42:55,715 --> 00:43:00,840
Grazie, Miss. The doctor has an
emergency in the clinic.

393
00:43:01,291 --> 00:43:04,155
An emergency in the clinic!
It's the same doctor...

394
00:43:12,928 --> 00:43:16,575
No doctor, Miss, no doctor!

395
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:28,381
Come in.

396
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:39,992
What's the problem?
-My back, doctor.

397
00:43:40,092 --> 00:43:42,276
My back really hurts.

398
00:43:44,046 --> 00:43:45,214
Turn around.

399
00:43:45,261 --> 00:43:47,352
Que?
-Turn around.

400
00:43:48,502 --> 00:43:50,445
But we know each other.

401
00:43:50,623 --> 00:43:53,443
Maybe you know my cousin?

402
00:43:53,812 --> 00:43:55,859
Forster Hannibal from Kunia.

403
00:43:56,071 --> 00:43:59,843
Maybe we look like each other.
-Yes, maybe.

404
00:44:00,965 --> 00:44:04,965
I'm in so much pain.
-It'll pass.

405
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:08,318
It's gone.
You're such a good doctor.

406
00:44:09,035 --> 00:44:10,577
I'll be back tomorrow.

407
00:44:10,624 --> 00:44:12,868
That's not necessary, doctor.

408
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:16,111
What a bastard, that doctor.

409
00:44:16,848 --> 00:44:19,178
Who'll get the millions?
Read the Tribune.

410
00:44:19,278 --> 00:44:21,549
Heir will be announced tonight.

411
00:44:22,181 --> 00:44:25,209
Read who'll get the billion!

412
00:44:26,014 --> 00:44:32,189
Medical check-ups have shown that we
have three incurably ill.

413
00:44:32,746 --> 00:44:35,979
Three? That's impossible.
-Why not?

414
00:44:36,056 --> 00:44:38,502
Three seems a lot.

415
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:41,898
And who are the other two?
-The other two?

416
00:44:41,914 --> 00:44:45,766
Yes, the ones I'll have to share
the inheritance with.

417
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:48,345
But you won't share anything, Miss.

418
00:44:48,445 --> 00:44:51,193
What?
-You're in very good health.

419
00:44:51,293 --> 00:44:53,550
You have no reason to claim
the inheritance.

420
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:56,140
What about my cellulitis?
-Just lose weight.

421
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,558
I won't accept that.

422
00:44:57,615 --> 00:45:02,097
I'll get what I'm entitled to.
I'll sue you.

423
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:04,873
You'll hear from me.

424
00:45:06,317 --> 00:45:07,859
What about the three heirs?

425
00:45:08,312 --> 00:45:10,131
The three heirs are really
two heirs.

426
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:15,461
Since he's not legally accountable...

427
00:45:16,243 --> 00:45:18,139
Mr Forster Valmorin, present here...

428
00:45:18,657 --> 00:45:20,647
can't claim the inheritance.

429
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:26,162
But... I'm not crazy.
I'm not crazy.

430
00:45:27,797 --> 00:45:30,461
I'm not crazy, sir.

431
00:45:33,322 --> 00:45:36,812
I'm not crazy, I'm American!

432
00:45:39,857 --> 00:45:41,549
Where's the consulate?

433
00:45:41,749 --> 00:45:43,929
Where's the consulate? I'm not crazy.

434
00:45:44,603 --> 00:45:46,274
He's completely crazy.

435
00:45:47,172 --> 00:45:50,831
Let's get back to our two heirs.

436
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,212
The first one is Mr Luigi Valmorin.

437
00:45:54,693 --> 00:45:59,219
Me? I don't understand.
You must be making a mistake.

438
00:45:59,576 --> 00:46:01,908
The reports are official.

439
00:46:03,763 --> 00:46:08,620
Reticuloendoteliosis with enlarged
bilateral mediastinum...

440
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,010
and diffuse sclerosis in
the parenchyma.

441
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:12,214
Excuse me?

442
00:46:15,093 --> 00:46:16,775
And the other one?

443
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:18,879
The other one's Mr Pierre Valmorin.

444
00:46:18,919 --> 00:46:21,862
Me? That's impossible.
I feel better than ever.

445
00:46:23,382 --> 00:46:24,502
Pierre Valmorin.

446
00:46:25,188 --> 00:46:29,381
Contraction of the aorta, reduction
of the aortic isthmus leading to...

447
00:46:29,481 --> 00:46:33,988
circulatory problems and
a malfunctioning enlarged heart.

448
00:46:37,762 --> 00:46:42,728
Let me both express my congratulations
and my sympathy.

449
00:46:42,786 --> 00:46:44,183
Grazie

450
00:46:44,283 --> 00:46:49,298
Great, so the men inherit now?
So much for chivalry.

451
00:46:49,398 --> 00:46:54,616
At least I'm healthy. And I have cows.
That's more secure.

452
00:46:56,045 --> 00:46:59,383
You will hear from me.
Ciao!

453
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:03,003
Where do I sign?

454
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:06,112
One second, I haven't finished.

455
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:11,660
We have two people who are
incurably ill. Excuse me.

456
00:47:12,874 --> 00:47:15,311
The will only speaks of one heir...

457
00:47:15,701 --> 00:47:19,539
...so we can't proceed with
the succession straight away.

458
00:47:20,326 --> 00:47:23,044
We need the help of an expert,
a legal professional.

459
00:47:23,244 --> 00:47:29,370
I've hired a very competent person
of great integrity.

460
00:47:29,868 --> 00:47:31,481
Mr Meyer.

461
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,530
Come in.

462
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:38,001
Doctor Schuster would like
to speak to you.

463
00:47:38,201 --> 00:47:39,439
Let him wait.

464
00:47:39,441 --> 00:47:43,749
It can't wait.
It's about the Valmorin case.

465
00:47:43,942 --> 00:47:46,506
Is it? Let him in.

466
00:47:49,097 --> 00:47:52,717
If you allow me, I'd like to do
a little experiment.

467
00:47:53,041 --> 00:47:57,579
It will only take a few seconds.
Allow me.

468
00:48:02,241 --> 00:48:06,041
Miss?
-It's him.

469
00:48:06,636 --> 00:48:10,080
Can you explain?
-I'll tell you.

470
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:14,867
I put an X-ray of an incurably
ill person in my file.

471
00:48:15,067 --> 00:48:18,972
Smart, isn't it?
-And dishonest. Inspector.

472
00:48:21,936 --> 00:48:26,531
Arriverderci, permesso, arriverderci.
Arriverderci Pietro, such is life.

473
00:48:27,357 --> 00:48:33,232
Such is life.
A shame.

474
00:48:34,105 --> 00:48:35,617
Grazie mille.

475
00:48:42,109 --> 00:48:43,697
Here he is.

476
00:48:43,897 --> 00:48:46,275
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.

477
00:48:53,812 --> 00:49:00,505
My name's Galopin. For 200 years, my
family has been interested in yours...

478
00:49:00,705 --> 00:49:04,306
which owes us a lot.
-Grazie.

479
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:07,600
No luck, arrivederci!

480
00:49:09,442 --> 00:49:11,342
Luigi, Luigi!

481
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:20,453
Fate.

482
00:49:35,064 --> 00:49:37,340
Miss, where are you going?

483
00:49:39,282 --> 00:49:40,507
Are you free?

484
00:49:41,249 --> 00:49:43,138
You're no longer free.

485
00:50:03,615 --> 00:50:07,084
One moment, Galopin.
At your service. One moment.

486
00:50:07,302 --> 00:50:11,008
For 200 years my family has been
assisting yours...

487
00:50:11,009 --> 00:50:12,505
which owes us a lot.

488
00:50:12,978 --> 00:50:17,851
It is my duty to help you with
the difficulties you're facing today.

489
00:50:18,526 --> 00:50:21,526
Please follow me.

490
00:50:26,666 --> 00:50:28,728
Please... thank you.

491
00:50:40,334 --> 00:50:41,814
He's a real billionaire.

492
00:50:42,044 --> 00:50:44,230
Where are we going?
-To your hotel.

493
00:50:44,528 --> 00:50:46,299
To do what?
-Your suitcases.

494
00:50:46,341 --> 00:50:48,225
To go where?
-To your place.

495
00:50:48,516 --> 00:50:50,871
Our place?
-Don't try to understand.

496
00:50:52,491 --> 00:50:57,250
With Galopin, no more problems.
With Galopin, everything's fine.

497
00:50:57,350 --> 00:50:59,586
Go!

498
00:51:03,725 --> 00:51:05,475
Look, look.

499
00:51:10,944 --> 00:51:15,280
Look, do you like it?

500
00:51:16,035 --> 00:51:20,742
Of course it needs a lot of work,
but it will all happen.

501
00:51:21,154 --> 00:51:24,561
And what's it going to cost?
-65 million.

502
00:51:24,761 --> 00:51:28,930
That's a good deal.
You're a poet, an artist.

503
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:31,439
Money's not important to you.

504
00:51:31,639 --> 00:51:33,280
Let's be very clear.

505
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,678
With Galopin, everything will
be fine.

506
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:40,941
With Galopin... with Galopin...
Put those suitcases away.

507
00:51:42,007 --> 00:51:44,731
What was I saying?
-"Met Galopin."

508
00:51:45,253 --> 00:51:46,692
With Galopin...

509
00:52:36,346 --> 00:52:40,068
Do like everybody else.
I've been here for two hours.

510
00:52:40,862 --> 00:52:43,057
Careful, ladies and gentlemen.

511
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:48,632
Thank you.

512
00:52:48,862 --> 00:52:51,378
Careful, can I get past?

513
00:52:51,564 --> 00:52:53,106
Excuse me.

514
00:52:57,638 --> 00:53:00,540
Keep an eye on him.
Don't let him out of your sight.

515
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,156
He's fragile and his
heart's worth gold.

516
00:53:03,256 --> 00:53:05,441
Do you understand?
It's worth gold.

517
00:53:05,677 --> 00:53:06,991
There he is!

518
00:53:19,308 --> 00:53:22,319
Please, he's ill.

519
00:53:22,986 --> 00:53:24,230
What do you want?
-Money.

520
00:53:24,313 --> 00:53:26,496
Galopin is your man for money.

521
00:53:31,071 --> 00:53:32,421
Later.

522
00:53:33,972 --> 00:53:37,252
Let me introduce Freda, your nurse.
-Nice to meet you.

523
00:53:38,604 --> 00:53:42,060
Simpson, your butler.

524
00:53:44,571 --> 00:53:46,554
They'll be looking after you.

525
00:53:46,561 --> 00:53:48,125
What are they doing?

526
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,228
An elevator.
-But there's only one more floor.

527
00:53:50,428 --> 00:53:54,276
Your heart, an elevator.
Your heart, an elevator.

528
00:53:54,781 --> 00:53:57,081
Can I go upstairs to rest?

529
00:53:57,149 --> 00:53:59,392
Go ahead, but slowly.

530
00:54:02,603 --> 00:54:05,041
Don't worry, I'll look after everything.
Careful!

531
00:54:17,662 --> 00:54:19,924
Yes, but how much does your
couscous cost?

532
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:24,967
What are you doing?

533
00:54:27,691 --> 00:54:30,479
What are you doing?
-I'm making a hole.

534
00:54:30,681 --> 00:54:33,842
What?
-A hole!

535
00:54:44,418 --> 00:54:46,622
Later, later.

536
00:54:46,722 --> 00:54:50,023
We'll talk later!

537
00:54:50,503 --> 00:54:52,087
We're going there.

538
00:54:52,567 --> 00:54:54,795
Why are they digging a hole in
the garden?

539
00:54:54,995 --> 00:54:57,013
A swimming pool.
-To do what?

540
00:54:58,433 --> 00:54:59,635
For... the heart.

541
00:55:07,341 --> 00:55:10,700
Pulse normal.
You can take him away.

542
00:55:13,936 --> 00:55:16,986
Pigheaded, aren't you?
-56, 57.

543
00:55:17,573 --> 00:55:20,559
And funny too.
-Così, così.

544
00:55:21,209 --> 00:55:23,153
Now we're going to have fun.

545
00:56:31,251 --> 00:56:34,700
Mr Pierre Valmorin!

546
00:56:36,589 --> 00:56:42,327
Mr William Donovan of the "Standard
International Corporation" in Detroit.

547
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:48,204
Mr Pezzani from Milan Steelworks.
-Buongiorno.

548
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:53,015
Dr. Otto Wagner, from Ruhr Metallurgy.
-Grüss Gott.

549
00:56:55,243 --> 00:56:56,880
Gentlemen...

550
00:56:57,372 --> 00:57:02,359
These gentlemen have been so
nice as to visit you.

551
00:57:04,667 --> 00:57:09,382
Gentlemen, I hope we can do
business together.

552
00:57:16,006 --> 00:57:19,667
Can we get to the point
right away?

553
00:57:24,125 --> 00:57:27,677
Gentlemen, that's enough.
We have no more time.

554
00:57:27,857 --> 00:57:32,026
What are the intentions of
Mr Valmorin?

555
00:57:32,405 --> 00:57:35,509
Me?
-Yes, exactly what do you want?

556
00:57:36,026 --> 00:57:37,793
Well, can I speak frankly?

557
00:57:38,565 --> 00:57:44,229
Of course.
-Gentlemen, I'd like a trumpet.

558
00:57:45,255 --> 00:57:47,933
A trumpet, what for?

559
00:57:48,128 --> 00:57:49,633
To play.

560
00:57:50,355 --> 00:57:53,251
This must be a misunderstanding.
He must mean a factory.

561
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:57,172
An enormous trumpet factory or
a double bass factory.

562
00:58:01,032 --> 00:58:04,686
But... but what's that about
a trumpet?

563
00:58:04,745 --> 00:58:07,885
I want to play a trumpet.

564
00:58:10,515 --> 00:58:14,819
Have you seen what happened
to Forster?

565
00:58:16,687 --> 00:58:18,026
Where are you going?

566
00:58:18,126 --> 00:58:20,927
Whale hunting, Captain.

567
00:58:27,656 --> 00:58:29,782
Let's go!

568
00:58:30,282 --> 00:58:36,356
Let's go! Set the sails!

569
00:58:36,867 --> 00:58:40,930
Lower the flag!

570
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,229
Happy?
-Very.

571
00:58:52,885 --> 00:58:55,126
You need to sign two invoices.

572
00:58:55,784 --> 00:58:59,127
This one and that one.

573
00:59:02,514 --> 00:59:05,147
Good, that's good.

574
00:59:07,635 --> 00:59:08,650
Mama!

575
00:59:09,228 --> 00:59:11,861
Hello, I'm so happy.

576
00:59:21,186 --> 00:59:25,068
The bill from my tailor.
Will you look after it?

577
00:59:26,254 --> 00:59:27,716
Hello, Pierre.

578
00:59:28,199 --> 00:59:29,994
We read the good news in the paper.

579
00:59:30,194 --> 00:59:33,011
We packed our suitcases and
here we are.

580
00:59:33,145 --> 00:59:36,908
Children, it's strange to kiss
a billionaire.

581
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:39,131
Not a bad place.

582
00:59:39,189 --> 00:59:40,544
Are you doing well?
-Yes.

583
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:44,333
I'm doing fine, you know.
-Tony will be bigger than Luis Mariano.

584
00:59:44,374 --> 00:59:46,860
Where's Jo-Jo?

585
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:48,931
Why didn't you bring Jo-Jo?
-But we did.

586
00:59:49,932 --> 00:59:53,446
Jo-Jo!

587
00:59:56,583 --> 00:59:58,609
Where's the little bastard?

588
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:01,465
I'll teach you...
-Leave my Jo-Jo alone.

589
01:00:01,582 --> 01:00:04,619
He took the hand brake off my car.
-So what?

590
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:08,186
We'll pay for it.
My brother-in-law's a billionaire.

591
01:00:08,286 --> 01:00:10,849
That's no excuse.
-Yes, it is.

592
01:00:10,949 --> 01:00:12,234
How's that?

593
01:00:14,934 --> 01:00:21,636
Send me an invoice. 10%, 25%.
We'll fix them. I mean, we'll fix it.

594
01:00:25,327 --> 01:00:27,528
Fraud!
-Jo-Jo, be quiet.

595
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,106
Leave him be.
You're giving him complexes.

596
01:00:34,155 --> 01:00:35,924
Don't worry, Pierre.

597
01:00:35,971 --> 01:00:40,323
We don't need much room. You won't
notice we're here. Come, children.

598
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:48,562
Come, dance.
-Please!

599
01:00:52,407 --> 01:00:53,727
Ah, that's pretty.

600
01:00:54,979 --> 01:00:57,112
Very pretty. How much is it worth?

601
01:00:57,833 --> 01:00:59,895
130 francs.
-For the dress?

602
01:00:59,995 --> 01:01:05,198
No, by the metre.
-Just wear something over it.

603
01:01:05,398 --> 01:01:07,876
Denise, we have to change these.

604
01:01:07,911 --> 01:01:09,695
They're ugly and cold.

605
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:11,689
We have to change them,
like in the 16th.

606
01:01:11,889 --> 01:01:13,988
I love the 16th.

607
01:01:15,103 --> 01:01:17,993
The 16th?
-Yes, the 16th arrondissement.

608
01:01:19,021 --> 01:01:22,661
They have beautiful houses there.
Don't they, Galopin?

609
01:01:23,072 --> 01:01:24,949
What are you doing there?

610
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:29,311
Little Galopin's hiding.

611
01:01:30,236 --> 01:01:36,719
Stripes make you thinner.
That looks very young!

612
01:01:38,543 --> 01:01:42,593
Pierre!

613
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:46,416
There he is!

614
01:01:48,226 --> 01:01:51,883
It's wonderful, Pierre.
We're doing everything in 16th style.

615
01:01:52,047 --> 01:01:53,414
Everything!

616
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:04,226
What's that, mummy?
-It's a vase.

617
01:02:04,606 --> 01:02:07,149
We'll put it in the hallway.
It will be beautiful.

618
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:09,208
It'll freshen up the room.

619
01:02:09,848 --> 01:02:11,420
I'm so happy. That way.

620
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:14,259
Don't break it.

621
01:02:56,982 --> 01:02:59,395
Ah, good timing.
Let me introduce Mr Plushnok.

622
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:01,499
An excellent publicity agent.

623
01:03:01,664 --> 01:03:06,358
He made professional posters for me.
Tony Valmin, Singer of Tomorrow.

624
01:03:06,968 --> 01:03:08,381
It sounds good.

625
01:03:08,817 --> 01:03:11,197
I got a recording contract.
Fantastic.

626
01:03:11,317 --> 01:03:13,750
A big deal.
-A big deal? I'll be back.

627
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:16,696
Mr Delion, the President.

628
01:03:17,845 --> 01:03:19,438
We got a really good deal.

629
01:03:19,654 --> 01:03:20,918
10 million.
-10 million?

630
01:03:22,572 --> 01:03:27,261
Bricks, always bricks.
I'm fed up with these bricks.

631
01:03:36,577 --> 01:03:37,887
Get up.

632
01:03:38,168 --> 01:03:42,092
I get dizzy.
-You will when your ten metres high up.

633
01:03:51,497 --> 01:03:53,550
Ah, give me that.

634
01:03:55,967 --> 01:03:58,062
Two per hour.

635
01:04:00,671 --> 01:04:02,004
What did you say?

636
01:04:27,754 --> 01:04:30,205
Pierre!
-To the house, terrible child.

637
01:04:30,764 --> 01:04:33,214
Pierre disappeared and
he didn't leave a will.

638
01:04:33,507 --> 01:04:35,449
We have to find him.
-Of course.

639
01:04:36,915 --> 01:04:38,220
Go to the house, you.

640
01:04:51,517 --> 01:04:53,020
It's not him.

641
01:04:57,861 --> 01:05:00,190
Have you seen a man with
a trumpet?

642
01:05:02,862 --> 01:05:05,396
Have you seen a tall man with
a trumpet?

643
01:05:05,596 --> 01:05:07,723
Arielle, excuse her, Father.

644
01:05:38,624 --> 01:05:40,731
Come closer, ladies and gentlemen.

645
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:42,686
Look, a brave man.

646
01:05:45,532 --> 01:05:48,398
A 3 minute round against
Joe Anthonis.

647
01:05:48,498 --> 01:05:49,694
That's not why I'm here.

648
01:05:49,763 --> 01:05:51,452
Here is Joe Anthonis.
-No, no.

649
01:05:51,767 --> 01:05:54,098
200 Swiss francs at stake.

650
01:05:54,198 --> 01:05:57,471
No, I'm not...
-Beat Anthonis in six minutes.

651
01:05:58,004 --> 01:06:01,386
I'm looking for my brother-in-law.
A tall guy with a trumpet.

652
01:06:01,745 --> 01:06:03,082
Are you ready?

653
01:06:03,201 --> 01:06:05,345
No. Help!

654
01:06:18,473 --> 01:06:21,244
This is a mistake.
I'm looking for my brother-in-law.

655
01:06:22,123 --> 01:06:24,228
My brother-in-law's a tall guy.

656
01:06:24,428 --> 01:06:25,734
You're not.

657
01:06:25,934 --> 01:06:27,211
Come, quickly.

658
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:31,217
Galopin!

659
01:06:32,583 --> 01:06:34,672
Did you see him?
-No, did you find him?

660
01:06:35,402 --> 01:06:38,175
We checked the entire village.
He's nowhere to be found.

661
01:06:38,375 --> 01:06:39,573
Tony!
-I saw him.

662
01:06:39,682 --> 01:06:41,981
Who, Pierre?
-No, the Abominable Snowman.

663
01:06:42,708 --> 01:06:43,775
Idiot.

664
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,070
Look there.

665
01:06:45,638 --> 01:06:47,127
Igor! What's he doing there?

666
01:06:47,823 --> 01:06:49,684
Igor, come!

667
01:07:00,456 --> 01:07:01,870
Listen!

668
01:07:02,133 --> 01:07:03,297
What's that?

669
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:05,728
Over there!

670
01:07:05,859 --> 01:07:07,551
It's Pierre!

671
01:07:08,009 --> 01:07:12,148
Hurry up.

672
01:07:29,917 --> 01:07:31,955
Leave him.

673
01:07:32,473 --> 01:07:33,976
Go, leave him.

674
01:07:34,315 --> 01:07:35,690
Come, hurry.

675
01:07:35,841 --> 01:07:37,300
I'm drowning, I'm drowning.

676
01:07:37,305 --> 01:07:41,440
Later. Don't worry.
With Galopin you're safe.

677
01:07:41,451 --> 01:07:46,019
Hurry! With Galopin...
Swim!

678
01:07:47,522 --> 01:07:50,616
My dog.
-Swim!

679
01:09:07,469 --> 01:09:09,512
I'm coming.

680
01:09:27,793 --> 01:09:29,186
What about my trumpet?

681
01:09:29,382 --> 01:09:30,718
It's been confiscated.

682
01:09:31,387 --> 01:09:35,603
Write down, Madam. Two trumpets daily,
5 minutes before each meal.

683
01:09:37,762 --> 01:09:39,398
That's how it is.

684
01:09:40,317 --> 01:09:42,533
Look at that.
Have you seen yourselves?

685
01:09:42,633 --> 01:09:43,911
No, they haven't.

686
01:09:53,045 --> 01:09:56,185
Low blood pressure. Pulse?
-Very irregular, doctor.

687
01:09:57,003 --> 01:10:00,157
Complete check-up of the heart
at 3 pm.

688
01:10:01,049 --> 01:10:04,423
You can see the blood flows slowly
and irregularly.

689
01:10:04,486 --> 01:10:07,791
It's congenital, nothing we can do.
-Indeed.

690
01:10:10,354 --> 01:10:11,465
Write down, Miss.

691
01:10:11,816 --> 01:10:13,906
Coarctation of the aorta.

692
01:10:14,006 --> 01:10:15,851
Reduction of the aortic isthmus...

693
01:10:16,027 --> 01:10:18,216
leading to poor circulation...

694
01:10:18,285 --> 01:10:21,481
causing heart failure
and enlargement of the heart.

695
01:10:21,681 --> 01:10:22,780
Untreatable.

696
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:26,030
Cosa?
I'm going to inherit.

697
01:10:26,271 --> 01:10:28,328
Coarctation of the aorta.

698
01:10:28,776 --> 01:10:30,353
That's clear, isn't it?

699
01:10:30,647 --> 01:10:36,671
Informative. Reduction of the aortic
isthmus, leading to circulation problems.

700
01:10:37,004 --> 01:10:38,342
Well?

701
01:10:39,899 --> 01:10:41,673
Will you excuse me for a moment?

702
01:10:51,004 --> 01:10:52,504
Pierre Valmorin.

703
01:10:52,663 --> 01:10:58,214
Coarctation of the aorta.
Reduction of the aortic isthmus...

704
01:10:58,751 --> 01:11:01,914
leading to heart failure
and inflammation of the heart.

705
01:11:02,413 --> 01:11:05,181
Luigi, cretino!

706
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:10,328
Che peccato!
I'm not crazy!

707
01:11:11,096 --> 01:11:15,449
I was in the hospital and
I tore it up like this.

708
01:11:15,549 --> 01:11:19,202
And the police...
-That's enough!

709
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:22,252
Enough said. It's clear, isn't it?
-Transparent.

710
01:11:25,587 --> 01:11:29,462
Miss, pass me Mr Pierre Valmorin,
please.

711
01:11:34,549 --> 01:11:36,756
Hello, Mr Pierre Valmorin?

712
01:11:37,138 --> 01:11:38,151
It's for you.

713
01:11:38,866 --> 01:11:40,478
Pierre Valmorin speaking.

714
01:11:41,042 --> 01:11:42,081
Ah, it's you.

715
01:11:42,468 --> 01:11:44,717
I have good news.
You're not ill.

716
01:11:45,108 --> 01:11:46,745
No, it was a mistake.

717
01:11:48,837 --> 01:11:49,837
Hello?

718
01:11:55,362 --> 01:11:58,831
Luigi's ill. Luigi!

719
01:11:58,967 --> 01:12:02,882
No, it's not true, Luigi?

720
01:12:03,095 --> 01:12:05,533
But that's fantastic!

721
01:12:08,274 --> 01:12:13,170
I'm not ill.

722
01:12:17,821 --> 01:12:21,704
After thorough examination, he has been
diagnosed with an incurable illness.

723
01:12:21,804 --> 01:12:25,424
Drawn up in Valmorin Castle,
in the year of the Lord 1759.

724
01:12:25,781 --> 01:12:30,941
My heir shall have a clean record,
both military and civilian.

725
01:12:31,141 --> 01:12:33,427
But it didn't say that.
-Yes, it did.

726
01:12:33,585 --> 01:12:37,796
In the postscriptum.
-Postscriptum, postscriptum!

727
01:12:38,090 --> 01:12:40,495
I'm sorry.
-Me too.

728
01:12:47,209 --> 01:12:49,145
No luck.

729
01:12:52,418 --> 01:12:54,246
Postscriptum.

730
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:03,910
What do you think of this?
-I couldn't have hoped for this.

731
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:07,056
I have given instructions to proceed
with the formalities.

732
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:09,505
Charity's becoming a reality.

733
01:13:09,534 --> 01:13:12,226
In 48 hours, everything will
have been taken care of.

734
01:13:12,426 --> 01:13:15,854
And now we're going to settle
our debts.

735
01:13:15,935 --> 01:13:19,334
One moment, we still have to clear
up a few things.

736
01:13:19,710 --> 01:13:21,146
Which things?

737
01:13:21,810 --> 01:13:25,141
For instance, the French
Revolution.

738
01:13:25,191 --> 01:13:27,910
The French Revolution?
Here it all is.

739
01:13:27,991 --> 01:13:30,086
"Here it all is"...
that's easy to say.

740
01:13:30,286 --> 01:13:33,504
In these kinds of matters, there's
always the unexpected.

741
01:13:42,861 --> 01:13:46,648
I'm Jérôme Valmorin of the Society of
the Museum of Botanica and Plants.

742
01:13:53,230 --> 01:13:55,128
Let me explain.

743
01:13:55,629 --> 01:14:00,103
On 16 June 1932, the Society sent me
on a mission to Africa.

744
01:14:00,705 --> 01:14:04,124
The objective was to bring
the famous yupi grains to France.

745
01:14:04,224 --> 01:14:07,043
That's a small clematis.

746
01:14:07,143 --> 01:14:09,681
It's used to make soft glycerine
for dry eyelids.

747
01:14:09,881 --> 01:14:12,150
Conjunctivitis.

748
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:15,770
So I went on this adventure for
the good of science.

749
01:14:18,011 --> 01:14:23,662
From Timbuktu to Tanganyika,
through the savannah.

750
01:14:25,630 --> 01:14:30,020
Will I find a dicotyledon or
a monocotyledon? Mystery.

751
01:14:30,359 --> 01:14:33,615
My destination was the Oubangui.

752
01:14:35,006 --> 01:14:37,484
So I left.

753
01:14:38,164 --> 01:14:44,820
I travelled in a caravan,
with 10 porters, not natives.

754
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:48,204
I didn't know these guys yet.
10 porters from the Gare du Nord.

755
01:14:48,304 --> 01:14:51,856
Numbered in chronological order.
I like logic.

756
01:14:53,526 --> 01:14:55,085
The adventure started in Dakar.

757
01:14:55,259 --> 01:14:58,598
I like to start at the beginning.

758
01:14:58,825 --> 01:15:04,125
So I was with my ten men
and I was proudly riding my...

759
01:15:07,725 --> 01:15:10,309
a saddle and four legs...

760
01:15:11,045 --> 01:15:12,807
Well anyway, I was riding it.

761
01:15:13,007 --> 01:15:14,722
We arrived in Bouchebaie.

762
01:15:14,756 --> 01:15:16,679
Some straw huts in the suburbs
of Timbuktu.

763
01:15:16,879 --> 01:15:19,407
In the zone.
-In the torrid zone, he says.

764
01:15:19,549 --> 01:15:26,201
Then someone yelled. I turned around.
There was a porter missing. Number 10.

765
01:15:26,886 --> 01:15:28,402
My best porter.

766
01:15:28,976 --> 01:15:34,046
Eaten in the desert by a...

767
01:15:36,218 --> 01:15:40,524
The males have manes.
-A lion.

768
01:15:41,043 --> 01:15:43,266
Named after the third biggest city
in France.

769
01:15:44,598 --> 01:15:46,568
Anyway, number 10 had been
eaten.

770
01:15:46,768 --> 01:15:50,687
We were near Dahomey and we were
crossing the 8th degree of latitude.

771
01:15:51,418 --> 01:15:56,018
The savannah changed to lush
vegetation.

772
01:15:57,645 --> 01:16:00,258
And there... false hope.

773
01:16:01,945 --> 01:16:06,247
I thought I saw my yupi...

774
01:16:06,633 --> 01:16:08,908
the little head of the yupi
clematis.

775
01:16:09,862 --> 01:16:13,313
I picked it.
Wrong, lichen.

776
01:16:14,019 --> 01:16:16,510
A common fabacea specimen.
I heared "Damn!"

777
01:16:16,610 --> 01:16:18,449
What was that?
-I didn't say anything.

778
01:16:18,494 --> 01:16:22,499
When I came back, 2 porters were
missing, number 8 and 9. The two best.

779
01:16:23,004 --> 01:16:29,980
Eaten in the river by...
a long...

780
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:32,577
A hippopotamus.

781
01:16:32,769 --> 01:16:37,285
No, not a... it was...
It went like this...

782
01:16:37,385 --> 01:16:40,247
It wasn't a hippopotamus then.
-No, it wasn't.

783
01:16:40,394 --> 01:16:43,739
It was a... They make handbags
of them and they cry.

784
01:16:43,984 --> 01:16:49,167
An ichthyosaurus, a motosaurus...
Anyway, 8 and 9 had been eaten.

785
01:16:49,367 --> 01:16:50,849
We continued.

786
01:16:50,971 --> 01:16:53,537
The caravan was sad, of course.

787
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:58,183
Near Yabonbanania, at the Sudanese
border, I heard...

788
01:16:58,796 --> 01:17:03,279
And 3 porters were missing.
5, 6 and 7, my three best.

789
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:05,674
6 and 7 had been trampled by a...

790
01:17:07,663 --> 01:17:14,503
striped... runs fast. Anyway.
Number 5 choked.

791
01:17:14,603 --> 01:17:17,934
By a python.
-No, on a piece of old bread.

792
01:17:18,929 --> 01:17:23,791
My last 4 porters said to me:
"At his speed...".

793
01:17:23,891 --> 01:17:28,046
But I was only thinking of my
yupi, my little clematis.

794
01:17:28,246 --> 01:17:31,355
We left Sudan, I heard a sound
and I looked behind me.

795
01:17:31,381 --> 01:17:37,044
Another porter was missing?
-No. Who did I see? Hannibal.

796
01:17:38,190 --> 01:17:39,240
Hannibal?

797
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:42,187
Hannibal. He said "Valmorin, cousin..."

798
01:17:42,287 --> 01:17:45,411
"If you want your inheritance,
you should pack your bags."

799
01:17:45,511 --> 01:17:47,290
And here I am.
Where do I sign?

800
01:17:47,490 --> 01:17:52,211
Wait, first, we need to know if you're
incurably ill.

801
01:17:52,311 --> 01:17:54,026
I'm incurable.
I'll prove it.

802
01:17:54,507 --> 01:17:56,051
Porter, papers.

803
01:17:59,422 --> 01:18:03,364
First, medical certificates.

804
01:18:06,530 --> 01:18:09,289
Second, clarifying notes.

805
01:18:12,236 --> 01:18:17,992
Irritation of the sciatic nerve, plus
overlapping thoracic nerves...

806
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:22,311
causing spinal disturbances from
the base of the sacral plexus...

807
01:18:22,878 --> 01:18:27,731
which rise towards the brain...

808
01:18:27,879 --> 01:18:32,673
causing zygomatic imbalance, both
on the right and the left.

809
01:18:32,969 --> 01:18:37,839
Which is why I'm pulling
these faces.

810
01:18:39,215 --> 01:18:40,954
Where do I sign?

811
01:18:41,214 --> 01:18:43,242
This is all very complicated.

812
01:18:43,342 --> 01:18:45,684
Careful, don't start with me.

813
01:18:45,982 --> 01:18:47,954
Porter, my rifle.

814
01:18:49,962 --> 01:18:53,976
Crack, loaded, dangerous.
Jérôme's not a little boy.

815
01:19:07,563 --> 01:19:10,144
Hannibal will be happy.
-Hannibal?

816
01:19:10,693 --> 01:19:14,845
We're sharing.
Fifty-fifty.

817
01:19:15,739 --> 01:19:17,346
Fifty-fifty?

818
01:19:18,310 --> 01:19:21,874
Did you hear that, Meyer?
Fifty-fifty!

819
01:19:23,782 --> 01:19:25,430
Fifty-fifty!

820
01:19:28,987 --> 01:19:32,415
Hallo there, in that boat.
Who are you?

821
01:19:32,884 --> 01:19:35,164
I'm a prisoner of the English.

822
01:19:35,729 --> 01:19:38,545
We're coming on board!

823
01:19:38,645 --> 01:19:42,087
We'll share the loot!

824
01:19:42,287 --> 01:19:44,920
Fifty-fifty! Fifty-fifty!

825
01:22:01,126 --> 01:22:03,440
Jo-Jo, little mongrel!

826
01:22:07,562 --> 01:22:10,512
You're the supplier?
-Yes, sir.

827
01:22:11,818 --> 01:22:18,616
257,342,740 francs, no less.

828
01:22:20,458 --> 01:22:24,515
Here you are. Anything else?

829
01:22:25,689 --> 01:22:29,636
You're Yul Brynner, the taxman.

830
01:22:31,961 --> 01:22:35,230
Personal taxes will be automatically
withheld.

831
01:22:35,330 --> 01:22:37,996
Personal taxes withheld.

832
01:22:38,554 --> 01:22:39,787
It's not cheap.

833
01:22:39,987 --> 01:22:42,709
Tax on solidarity, liberty,
equality and fraternity.

834
01:22:43,932 --> 01:22:50,382
A total of 499,999,999 francs.

835
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:54,218
Enough to buy yourself a new
country.

836
01:22:55,039 --> 01:22:57,008
It's funny... not really.

837
01:23:00,687 --> 01:23:03,141
Who do I see?

838
01:23:03,241 --> 01:23:07,821
You get... the rest.
Right?

839
01:23:08,470 --> 01:23:20,295
Wait.
-242,657,259 francs.

840
01:23:21,325 --> 01:23:23,348
You calculated that exactly.

841
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:33,528
That's a relief.

842
01:23:35,366 --> 01:23:37,174
UNION OF SWISS BANKS
