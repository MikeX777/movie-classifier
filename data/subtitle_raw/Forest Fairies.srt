00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:16,508
No, no, no, this is all wrong.

33
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,877
Forks go on the left,
knives on the right.

34
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,480
Am I the only one who cares
about throwing a good party?

35
00:02:21,482 --> 00:02:23,383
Yes, McKenna,
you're the only one

36
00:02:23,385 --> 00:02:24,817
who cares about the party.

37
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:27,152
None of us could possibly
care as much as you.

38
00:02:27,154 --> 00:02:29,121
What are forks even for?

39
00:02:29,123 --> 00:02:31,858
Emilyn, that cake
is for the party.

40
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,460
Relax, that's the
keep Emilyn away

41
00:02:33,462 --> 00:02:35,694
from the real cake cake.

42
00:02:35,696 --> 00:02:39,198
Don't worry, I won't let
her ruin the real cake.

43
00:02:41,503 --> 00:02:42,769
That's the let Harper think

44
00:02:42,771 --> 00:02:45,371
she's guarding the
real cake cake.

45
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,343
Aleeda put me in charge

46
00:02:51,345 --> 00:02:52,912
while she went to
the wedding ceremony,

47
00:02:52,914 --> 00:02:55,448
and she said that everything
has to be perfect, so I...

48
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,354
Hey, where do
you guys want this?

49
00:02:59,487 --> 00:03:03,526
Finally,
something done right.

50
00:03:06,861 --> 00:03:08,228
Whoa.

51
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,196
Would you look at the
size of that thing?

52
00:03:10,198 --> 00:03:12,132
It must be worth a fortune.

53
00:03:12,134 --> 00:03:14,537
Or at least a lot of money.

54
00:03:21,543 --> 00:03:25,210
From your first
breath to my last.

55
00:03:25,212 --> 00:03:28,080
Aleeda wants to give it to
them as soon as they get here.

56
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:30,182
Now, if they show up right
after the wedding ceremony,

57
00:03:30,184 --> 00:03:33,019
the sun should be
directly above us,

58
00:03:33,021 --> 00:03:36,256
so that will make the
optimal placement.

59
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:39,893
Stop being so smart
and hang it on the rock.

60
00:03:39,895 --> 00:03:41,093
Be careful.

61
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,728
Aleeda spent months on that.

62
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,732
Relax, everything
is taken care of.

63
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,542
Do you think they'll like it?

64
00:03:55,544 --> 00:03:57,644
Of course, it's perfect.

65
00:03:57,646 --> 00:03:59,978
That's
enough admiration.

66
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,015
We still have plenty
of work to do.

67
00:04:03,017 --> 00:04:06,485
Now, what time did Aleeda
say they're coming?

68
00:04:06,487 --> 00:04:07,656
They're not.

69
00:04:12,527 --> 00:04:15,160
I've reevaluated our priorities.

70
00:04:15,162 --> 00:04:16,628
We've wasted far too
much time on them,

71
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,364
so I'm cancelling the party.

72
00:04:19,366 --> 00:04:20,366
What do you mean?

73
00:04:20,368 --> 00:04:22,268
What happened?

74
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,003
Nothing happened.

75
00:04:24,005 --> 00:04:27,674
Fairies belong in the forest
and humans belong out there.

76
00:04:27,676 --> 00:04:29,241
But, Aleeda,
you've always said...

77
00:04:29,243 --> 00:04:31,376
No fairy will have
any contact with humans

78
00:04:31,378 --> 00:04:33,246
from this day forward.

79
00:04:33,248 --> 00:04:35,851
Aleeda, what about your gift?

80
00:04:41,522 --> 00:04:44,859
Leave it as a
reminder of our mistake.

81
00:04:50,364 --> 00:04:51,797
Is that it?

82
00:04:51,799 --> 00:04:53,566
Are we ever gonna
see them again?

83
00:04:53,568 --> 00:04:55,068
If Aleeda says we aren't,

84
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,470
then that's the way it will be.

85
00:04:57,472 --> 00:04:58,638
Now, throw out the cake

86
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,006
and start taking
down the decorations.

87
00:05:28,303 --> 00:05:32,472
My Pop was the most
stubborn man I know.

88
00:05:32,474 --> 00:05:34,974
When I was nine we moved
to the city for Mom's work,

89
00:05:34,976 --> 00:05:38,076
and I didn't wanna leave my Pop,

90
00:05:38,078 --> 00:05:39,412
'cause he was was
my whole world,

91
00:05:39,414 --> 00:05:42,080
but he told me it'd be all right

92
00:05:42,082 --> 00:05:45,350
because if you love something,

93
00:05:45,352 --> 00:05:49,087
truly love something, than
nothing can keep you apart.

94
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:50,590
I thought he was
just being nice,

95
00:05:50,592 --> 00:05:54,626
but when we got there there
was a computer waiting for me

96
00:05:54,628 --> 00:05:58,597
with a note that said,
"Because I truly love you,"

97
00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:02,969
and a P.S., "As soon as I
figure out how this works,

98
00:06:02,971 --> 00:06:04,306
"I'll call you."

99
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,609
After a day of cursing
and phone calls,

100
00:06:09,611 --> 00:06:13,111
my Pop figured out how to
call me on the computer,

101
00:06:13,113 --> 00:06:16,719
and every day after
that without exception.

102
00:06:19,154 --> 00:06:20,486
He helped
me with my homework,

103
00:06:20,488 --> 00:06:23,422
and he'd send me silly
videos on my birthday.

104
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:27,595
He'd just listen
to me if I wanted to talk.

105
00:06:29,763 --> 00:06:33,936
He was my best friend, and
I'm really gonna miss him.

106
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,207
The worst part was finding
out that my Pop was wrong,

107
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:44,380
because no matter
how much I love him,

108
00:06:49,116 --> 00:06:51,751
he can't come back!

109
00:06:51,753 --> 00:06:53,087
Sweetie, wait!

110
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:05,301
Not having fun at
the party, petal?

111
00:07:11,072 --> 00:07:13,373
It's not party,
Gam, it's a funeral.

112
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:19,878
Sounds like someone
should tell them that.

113
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,181
How come you're not sad?

114
00:07:22,183 --> 00:07:23,752
Don't you miss him?

115
00:07:25,152 --> 00:07:26,385
The only time I miss someone

116
00:07:26,387 --> 00:07:30,491
is when I'll never see
them again.

117
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,998
Just because you left the farm

118
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,902
didn't mean I wouldn't
see you again, right?

119
00:07:42,904 --> 00:07:44,369
Not really the same thing.

120
00:07:44,371 --> 00:07:45,440
Sure it is.

121
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,342
I believed I'd see you when
your mum moved you away,

122
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,378
and here you are.

123
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:56,215
Well, I wish we had a
better reason for coming back.

124
00:07:56,217 --> 00:07:57,383
Did I ever tell you

125
00:07:57,385 --> 00:07:59,751
about the time I
helped invent popcorn?

126
00:07:59,753 --> 00:08:00,585
No.

127
00:08:00,587 --> 00:08:03,289
Well, I was at a fair,

128
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:05,090
and I had bumped
into a fire-eater

129
00:08:05,092 --> 00:08:07,225
who spat his fire
at the corn vendor.

130
00:08:07,227 --> 00:08:10,662
Oh, he was really angry
about losing his hair

131
00:08:10,664 --> 00:08:12,465
until the corn started popping.

132
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,602
Gammy, did you
guys get horses?

133
00:08:17,604 --> 00:08:20,106
Oh no, dear, we
don't have horses.

134
00:08:20,108 --> 00:08:21,239
Oh.

135
00:08:21,241 --> 00:08:23,042
Do you still like horses?

136
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,277
- I love them.
- Ah.

137
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,611
Mom still
takes me for lessons,

138
00:08:25,613 --> 00:08:28,681
but it's inside, so
it's not the same.

139
00:08:28,683 --> 00:08:31,850
I really miss going on
the trails with Pop.

140
00:08:31,852 --> 00:08:34,354
Probably why he
got you this then.

141
00:08:46,367 --> 00:08:47,933
Gammy, but you just...

142
00:08:47,935 --> 00:08:50,168
We don't have horses.

143
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,271
We just have this one.

144
00:08:55,209 --> 00:08:56,110
Hi there.

145
00:08:57,511 --> 00:09:00,879
Careful, honey,
Tanner's fussy.

146
00:09:00,881 --> 00:09:02,748
He's beautiful.

147
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,518
Pop's the only one
who could take him out.

148
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,686
Other tries, but Tanner
knows who he likes

149
00:09:07,688 --> 00:09:08,888
and who he doesn't.

150
00:09:10,158 --> 00:09:12,591
You miss
him too, don't you?

151
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:15,164
He can see you have his eyes.

152
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,731
I would
never hurt you.

153
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:23,304
Looks like someone
has a new best friend.

154
00:09:27,007 --> 00:09:28,740
Hey, what are you doing?

155
00:09:28,742 --> 00:09:31,643
Mom, look, this is Tanner.

156
00:09:31,645 --> 00:09:32,845
Isn't he handsome?

157
00:09:32,847 --> 00:09:35,248
Yes, but can you
stay back from there?

158
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,149
Mom, I ride them all the time.

159
00:09:37,151 --> 00:09:39,551
Well, that's different,
this is a farm horse.

160
00:09:42,189 --> 00:09:43,489
A farm horse?

161
00:09:43,491 --> 00:09:44,724
He was Pops's and
Gammy said that I...

162
00:09:44,726 --> 00:09:46,158
Amanda, we'll talk
about this later.

163
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,064
The guests are leaving,
we have to say goodbye.

164
00:09:52,366 --> 00:09:53,832
Come on, sweetie.

165
00:09:53,834 --> 00:09:56,536
Let's say goodbye
to the party guests.

166
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:02,978
And I will tell you all about
the time that I met Elvis,

167
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:06,481
Oh, he was very handsome

168
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:12,918
Thank you.

169
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,755
Thank you.

170
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,156
Condolences from our family.

171
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:17,993
Take care.

172
00:10:19,427 --> 00:10:21,726
Charlie, thanks for coming.

173
00:10:21,728 --> 00:10:23,296
How could I miss this?

174
00:10:23,298 --> 00:10:24,330
My dad would've been so happy

175
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,835
to see so many friendly faces.

176
00:10:28,369 --> 00:10:29,969
You and
Amanda staying long?

177
00:10:29,971 --> 00:10:31,771
No, we're
just here for the weekend.

178
00:10:31,773 --> 00:10:32,971
I've gotta go back to work.

179
00:10:32,973 --> 00:10:34,507
Sure.

180
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:36,875
You think you could drop by
my office in the morning?

181
00:10:36,877 --> 00:10:39,077
There's just some
business to finish up.

182
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:41,848
Sure thing, I'll
come by first thing.

183
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,816
Do you still like
blueberry scones?

184
00:10:43,818 --> 00:10:46,451
I'll
wear my belt loose.

185
00:10:46,453 --> 00:10:48,553
Okay.

186
00:10:48,555 --> 00:10:49,891
- Bye.
- Take care.

187
00:10:54,661 --> 00:10:55,430
Mom?

188
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:57,765
What is that?

189
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,666
I have no idea.

190
00:11:00,668 --> 00:11:02,033
Can you help me
with the kitchen?

191
00:11:02,035 --> 00:11:04,539
I have to put some stuff away.

192
00:11:07,641 --> 00:11:08,709
Yeah, sure.

193
00:11:17,986 --> 00:11:21,155
Amanda, have you
seen my toothbrush?

194
00:11:24,491 --> 00:11:26,124
Oh.

195
00:11:26,126 --> 00:11:27,359
I don't have one on me,

196
00:11:27,361 --> 00:11:28,326
but there's a spare one in...

197
00:11:28,328 --> 00:11:29,829
What? Why?

198
00:11:29,831 --> 00:11:32,731
Patty, Patty, what
on earth are you doing?

199
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:33,566
Mom, stay back.

200
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:34,800
Amanda, call 911!

201
00:11:34,802 --> 00:11:36,869
Oh, for heaven's sake.

202
00:11:36,871 --> 00:11:38,336
- No, no, no.
- Dylan, Dylan.

203
00:11:38,338 --> 00:11:40,038
- Nope.
- Are you okay?

204
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,139
Yeah.

205
00:11:41,141 --> 00:11:42,675
Mom, you know him?

206
00:11:42,677 --> 00:11:46,077
This is Dylan, he helps
me with the day-to-day.

207
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:46,914
Oh.

208
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,016
I'm so sorry.

209
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,182
Ah, it's my fault.

210
00:11:51,184 --> 00:11:53,386
I thought you'd like
a hot bowl of oatmeal.

211
00:11:53,388 --> 00:11:55,687
Kinda regret the hot
part now, though.

212
00:11:55,689 --> 00:11:57,757
Mom, why didn't you
tell me about him?

213
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,990
Because it's Dylan.

214
00:11:58,992 --> 00:12:00,493
He's always here.

215
00:12:00,495 --> 00:12:02,862
Oh, that clears that up then.

216
00:12:02,864 --> 00:12:04,062
Well, I'm off.

217
00:12:04,064 --> 00:12:06,632
I gotta go downtown
to see Charlie.

218
00:12:06,634 --> 00:12:08,133
I'll be back in a
couple of hours.

219
00:12:08,135 --> 00:12:11,637
Amanda, do me a favor
and make sure, um...

220
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:13,272
Dylan, or intruder.

221
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,873
You know, I'll answer to both.

222
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,942
Okay, if you can help
Dylan get cleaned up,

223
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:17,877
that'd be great.

224
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:19,778
Um, then can I go see Tanner?

225
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,681
No, sweetie, you've
gotta get ready.

226
00:12:21,683 --> 00:12:23,449
We've gotta get to
the airport on time.

227
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,383
I thought we weren't
leaving until tomorrow.

228
00:12:25,385 --> 00:12:27,152
Sweetheart,
you've just go here.

229
00:12:27,154 --> 00:12:29,154
I know, but work called,
and I've got this mess

230
00:12:29,156 --> 00:12:30,388
- to clean up...
- Mom!

231
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,724
Grownup
decisions, Amanda.

232
00:12:32,726 --> 00:12:34,560
All right, sorry about that...

233
00:12:34,562 --> 00:12:35,994
Violent oatmeal throwing?

234
00:12:35,996 --> 00:12:38,129
Yeah, no, it's fine.

235
00:12:38,131 --> 00:12:39,364
It's not fair.

236
00:12:39,366 --> 00:12:41,499
Come on, petal.

237
00:12:41,501 --> 00:12:43,005
It's not that bad.

238
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,638
Oh, no, you guys go.

239
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,139
I'll take care of this.

240
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,580
So while it may look like
they're close sometimes,

241
00:12:55,582 --> 00:12:58,316
I promise they
are very far away.

242
00:12:58,318 --> 00:13:00,353
So neither of you have
to worry about the sun

243
00:13:00,355 --> 00:13:02,321
and the moon crashing
into each other.

244
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:05,324
Huh, that actually
kept me up all night.

245
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:09,695
Oh, now I'm sad, because they'll
never get to be together.

246
00:13:11,966 --> 00:13:14,367
Hey, wanna throw the disc
at the edge of the forest?

247
00:13:14,369 --> 00:13:15,200
Oh, yes!

248
00:13:15,202 --> 00:13:16,268
Can I pick teams?

249
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,103
Sure.

250
00:13:17,105 --> 00:13:19,106
Okay, I choose Emilyn!

251
00:13:20,574 --> 00:13:23,042
I was so worried
you weren't gonna pick me.

252
00:13:23,044 --> 00:13:25,277
I felt like the
moon to your sun.

253
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,878
I don't have a son.

254
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,013
All right, let's go.

255
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,481
Losing daylight.

256
00:13:29,483 --> 00:13:32,784
Wait, why do we have to play
at the edge of the forest?

257
00:13:32,786 --> 00:13:34,487
I don't know, just
more open space.

258
00:13:34,489 --> 00:13:36,522
You're trying
to see that girl.

259
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,623
What?

260
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,124
No.

261
00:13:39,126 --> 00:13:42,827
I just think that there'd be
better range for throwing.

262
00:13:42,829 --> 00:13:46,364
Tell me you just
aren't a tiny bit interested.

263
00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:47,298
I knew it.

264
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,367
I'm going to tell Aleeda.

265
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,634
Aren't you curious?

266
00:13:49,636 --> 00:13:51,704
Come on, you of all the fairies.

267
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:53,439
All you do is study.

268
00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:56,307
Think of all the
things you could learn.

269
00:13:56,309 --> 00:13:58,244
Rules are rules.

270
00:13:58,246 --> 00:14:00,378
Well, what else would they be?

271
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,681
And I'm not
interested in learning

272
00:14:01,683 --> 00:14:03,449
what they have to offer.

273
00:14:03,451 --> 00:14:05,584
Aleeda is quite
clear on this point.

274
00:14:05,586 --> 00:14:08,287
We're not going,
and that's final.

275
00:14:11,858 --> 00:14:13,325
Okay, forget her.

276
00:14:13,327 --> 00:14:15,027
Let's just fly out to
the edge and have a look.

277
00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:16,696
I promise, we'll just look.

278
00:14:16,698 --> 00:14:18,431
I don't know, Cali.

279
00:14:18,433 --> 00:14:20,398
I don't wanna get in trouble.

280
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,933
Come with us.

281
00:14:21,935 --> 00:14:24,936
We'll tell you the sad story
about the sun and the moon.

282
00:14:24,938 --> 00:14:27,041
Nah, you guys go ahead.

283
00:14:33,548 --> 00:14:34,816
Good morning.

284
00:14:35,982 --> 00:14:38,183
Sorry, they didn't
have blueberry.

285
00:14:38,185 --> 00:14:41,186
Do I
look like I mind?

286
00:14:43,524 --> 00:14:44,525
Have a seat.

287
00:14:46,794 --> 00:14:49,130
Still the sheriff as well?

288
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:54,867
No one else stupid
enough to do it.

289
00:14:58,072 --> 00:14:59,872
I remember when you
first walked in here.

290
00:14:59,874 --> 00:15:01,373
Do you remember that?

291
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,808
I remember walking in
with my little piggy bank,

292
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:06,045
telling you to draw up a
emancipation agreement.

293
00:15:06,047 --> 00:15:08,547
I
think you called it

294
00:15:08,549 --> 00:15:11,550
an exaggeration agreement.

295
00:15:11,552 --> 00:15:14,420
Coming in here acting like a
grownup at eight years old.

296
00:15:14,422 --> 00:15:17,355
Somebody had to act like
a grownup in that house.

297
00:15:17,357 --> 00:15:19,624
I guess your folks did
beat to their own drums.

298
00:15:19,626 --> 00:15:20,593
Drums?

299
00:15:20,595 --> 00:15:22,327
More like pots and pans.

300
00:15:24,164 --> 00:15:25,830
Well, I won't keep you long.

301
00:15:25,832 --> 00:15:27,066
I know you're a busy gal.

302
00:15:27,068 --> 00:15:29,634
Just a bit of paperwork
to make it all legal.

303
00:15:29,636 --> 00:15:31,138
Thanks, Charlie,

304
00:15:32,573 --> 00:15:36,142
You know, I just wanna get
my mom into someplace nice.

305
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:38,042
How's that?

306
00:15:38,044 --> 00:15:41,479
Well, I looked at a
few retirement homes,

307
00:15:41,481 --> 00:15:45,654
and I'm not sure it's gonna be
an easy conversation to have.

308
00:15:47,221 --> 00:15:48,387
What?

309
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:50,158
He didn't tell you.

310
00:15:51,592 --> 00:15:54,259
Tell me what? What did he do?

311
00:15:54,261 --> 00:15:57,866
Just your dad beating
those pots and pans.

312
00:16:00,433 --> 00:16:01,466
What?

313
00:16:01,468 --> 00:16:03,234
I don't understand.

314
00:16:03,236 --> 00:16:05,370
He left me the house?

315
00:16:05,372 --> 00:16:07,373
Why wouldn't he give it to Mom?

316
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:11,546
I think it was
part of the bigger plan.

317
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,614
He wants to make the place
into a bed and breakfast?

318
00:16:16,616 --> 00:16:18,683
As far as I know,
everything's been done.

319
00:16:18,685 --> 00:16:19,920
What?

320
00:16:21,087 --> 00:16:25,123
Your dad, he worked on
this for a whole year.

321
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,758
He didn't tell you
anything about this?

322
00:16:30,164 --> 00:16:30,999
Dad.

323
00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:34,066
What did you do?

324
00:16:34,068 --> 00:16:36,837
Well, he did
make this for you.

325
00:16:47,814 --> 00:16:48,916
Hi, peanut.

326
00:16:50,483 --> 00:16:54,954
If you're seeing this, I'm
sorry to say, I've gone.

327
00:16:54,956 --> 00:16:57,089
Charlie, I bet you're wearing

328
00:16:57,091 --> 00:16:59,224
that silly green
tie, aren't you?

329
00:17:03,296 --> 00:17:08,067
I keep trying to tell
you, green is off-putting.

330
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,534
I'm leaving you all my ties.

331
00:17:09,536 --> 00:17:10,769
There's only three of them,

332
00:17:10,771 --> 00:17:14,476
but all of them would
be better than that one.

333
00:17:15,642 --> 00:17:18,711
But by now I'm sure
Charlie's told you

334
00:17:18,713 --> 00:17:20,378
about my little surprise.

335
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,147
I'm sorry to spring it
on you like this, peanut,

336
00:17:22,149 --> 00:17:26,321
but we both know that if I tried
to tell you about the idea,

337
00:17:27,521 --> 00:17:31,189
you'd just shut me down
before I even got going.

338
00:17:31,191 --> 00:17:34,392
I know I'm asking a lot of you,

339
00:17:34,394 --> 00:17:37,263
to come on home and
run a bed and breakfast

340
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:39,333
with your mum and Amanda.

341
00:17:41,302 --> 00:17:44,805
But when I look at
everything you've done,

342
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,710
I, quite frankly, I
couldn't be prouder of you.

343
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:55,281
My little girl went off
and took on the whole world

344
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:56,849
and beat them.

345
00:17:56,851 --> 00:18:01,753
And boy, I've loved being
in your cheering section.

346
00:18:01,755 --> 00:18:04,223
But I couldn't just
leave this world

347
00:18:04,225 --> 00:18:08,060
without giving you
and Amanda this gift,

348
00:18:08,062 --> 00:18:11,666
the gift of family,
because you deserve it.

349
00:18:12,832 --> 00:18:16,004
Just say the word if
you want to leave.

350
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:20,039
Your mum doesn't
even know about it.

351
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:23,979
Just tell Charlie and
he'll sell the place off,

352
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,883
you go back to your
big city living.

353
00:18:29,917 --> 00:18:31,151
It's your call.

354
00:18:33,653 --> 00:18:36,254
How can I say no to that?

355
00:18:36,256 --> 00:18:38,023
I got her, didn't I?

356
00:18:38,025 --> 00:18:42,197
Charlie, with all that guilt
stuff, I did, I got her.

357
00:18:44,899 --> 00:18:47,499
Well, that's it really.

358
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,001
I've set up everything.

359
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:53,171
Dylan knows all about it and
can fill you in on everything,

360
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:57,111
that is if you're granting
a dying man his wish.

361
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:02,350
I truly love you, Patty.

362
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:04,953
I always have done.

363
00:19:06,954 --> 00:19:08,790
From your first breath

364
00:19:10,824 --> 00:19:11,759
to my last.

365
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:19,467
Charlie, how do I
switch this thing off?

366
00:19:24,804 --> 00:19:25,640
Pops.

367
00:19:26,474 --> 00:19:27,309
So?

368
00:19:28,942 --> 00:19:31,045
What do you think, kiddo?

369
00:19:32,513 --> 00:19:36,180
I think I just inherited a
bed and breakfast.

370
00:19:42,089 --> 00:19:42,924
Gammy?

371
00:19:48,595 --> 00:19:49,427
Gammy?

372
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:50,265
Up here!

373
00:20:02,774 --> 00:20:03,442
Still not big
on cleaning, huh?

374
00:20:03,444 --> 00:20:05,511
Ah, pish posh.

375
00:20:05,513 --> 00:20:09,648
A clean house is a
sign of a boring life.

376
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:13,619
Well, then this place
is very not boring.

377
00:20:13,621 --> 00:20:14,485
What are you working on?

378
00:20:14,487 --> 00:20:16,522
Well, can't you tell?

379
00:20:16,524 --> 00:20:19,457
It's a sculpture of
you and your new friend.

380
00:20:19,459 --> 00:20:21,793
Am I really that ugly?

381
00:20:21,795 --> 00:20:25,967
If you want to see the beauty,
you have to believe in it.

382
00:20:29,303 --> 00:20:31,637
Well, I believe it
looks like a pretzel.

383
00:20:31,639 --> 00:20:34,606
But it's a very good pretzel.

384
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,074
Oh.

385
00:20:36,076 --> 00:20:37,878
Oh, I have missed you.

386
00:20:43,851 --> 00:20:45,684
Gam, you're getting
clay all over me.

387
00:20:45,686 --> 00:20:47,355
Oh, I am so sorry.

388
00:20:48,421 --> 00:20:49,253
Gam!

389
00:20:58,332 --> 00:21:02,000
Guess you must be pretty
handy with a mop, huh?

390
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,770
Sorry, I'll clean it.

391
00:21:04,772 --> 00:21:06,038
Don't worry about it.

392
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,173
You're gonna have to
save your strength.

393
00:21:08,175 --> 00:21:09,608
For what?

394
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,609
Well, I figure we can
start with the fence,

395
00:21:11,611 --> 00:21:13,044
and then once we're done that,

396
00:21:13,046 --> 00:21:14,780
we're gonna have to repaint
the side of the house.

397
00:21:14,782 --> 00:21:16,013
I think it's gonna stay white,

398
00:21:16,015 --> 00:21:18,783
but like a lighter
shade of white.

399
00:21:18,785 --> 00:21:20,084
Seriously?

400
00:21:20,086 --> 00:21:23,187
Well, it's either
that or the other job.

401
00:21:23,189 --> 00:21:24,923
Well, what's the other job?

402
00:21:24,925 --> 00:21:28,159
Well, somebody's gotta
take care of Tanner.

403
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:32,030
You know, feed him, brush him,
hang out with him all day.

404
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,131
Really?

405
00:21:33,133 --> 00:21:34,166
Can I, Gam?

406
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:36,033
He's waiting for you.

407
00:21:36,035 --> 00:21:40,207
Are you sure? I picked out
a really nice shade of white.

408
00:21:43,811 --> 00:21:46,648
And I mopped myself
into a corner.

409
00:21:49,283 --> 00:21:51,082
Morning, Tanner.

410
00:21:51,084 --> 00:21:53,087
Look what I brought you.

411
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,358
That's good, isn't it?

412
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,494
I can't believe I just met you
and I already have to leave.

413
00:22:03,496 --> 00:22:06,831
You know, maybe I can convince
Mom to come back next summer.

414
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,239
What's wrong, buddy?

415
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,543
You wanna go for a run?

416
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:18,843
Man, Mom would
totally ground me.

417
00:22:21,782 --> 00:22:24,249
It'll be worth it, come on.

418
00:22:57,251 --> 00:23:00,522
I bet Pop took you
out here a lot, huh?

419
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,487
What's wrong, buddy?

420
00:23:05,692 --> 00:23:07,359
I say we just fly
out and say hello.

421
00:23:07,361 --> 00:23:09,061
What's the worst
that could happen?

422
00:23:09,063 --> 00:23:10,294
We can't talk to her.

423
00:23:10,296 --> 00:23:11,463
McKenna said.

424
00:23:11,465 --> 00:23:13,165
McKenna is not the boss of us.

425
00:23:13,167 --> 00:23:14,933
Who knows if she
can even hear us?

426
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,105
Hello, is someone there?

427
00:23:18,339 --> 00:23:19,705
Whoa.

428
00:23:19,707 --> 00:23:23,308
Mind blown.

429
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,042
Look, she's probably lost.

430
00:23:25,044 --> 00:23:26,611
We can't just leave her
out there all alone.

431
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:27,646
I'm going.

432
00:23:27,648 --> 00:23:30,349
You will do no such thing.

433
00:23:30,351 --> 00:23:32,083
Her timing is awesome.

434
00:23:32,085 --> 00:23:33,619
Why are you always trying
to be the boss of me?

435
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:35,454
Keep your voice
down, she can hear us.

436
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:37,822
If she can hear us, then maybe
we're supposed to meet her.

437
00:23:37,824 --> 00:23:40,827
We have no reason
to go out there.

438
00:23:41,928 --> 00:23:43,427
What is that?

439
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,967
Well, now we have
to go help the horse.

440
00:23:49,969 --> 00:23:52,070
No, no, no, wait.

441
00:23:52,072 --> 00:23:53,908
Is that your umbrella?

442
00:23:56,709 --> 00:23:58,176
Yeah.

443
00:23:58,178 --> 00:23:59,013
Sorry.

444
00:24:03,883 --> 00:24:05,719
Okay, let's go home.

445
00:24:10,224 --> 00:24:12,393
I just wanted to say hi.

446
00:24:15,528 --> 00:24:17,029
What kind
of person does that?

447
00:24:17,031 --> 00:24:18,664
I said she could
take care of Tanner.

448
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:19,865
Uh-oh.

449
00:24:19,867 --> 00:24:21,132
I thought
she'd have fun.

450
00:24:21,134 --> 00:24:22,634
Well, maybe
you should let me decide

451
00:24:22,636 --> 00:24:24,002
what's fun for my daughter!

452
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,803
No, Mom, it's
not Dylan's fault.

453
00:24:25,805 --> 00:24:27,571
I didn't ask if I could ride.

454
00:24:27,573 --> 00:24:30,309
Do you have any idea
how dangerous that was?

455
00:24:30,311 --> 00:24:31,676
What were you thinking?

456
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:34,346
I just wanted to ride
him once before we left.

457
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:37,685
Well, we may not
be leaving after all.

458
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:39,818
We're staying?

459
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,852
Oh, thank you, thank
you, thank you.

460
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:46,724
For now, Amanda.

461
00:24:46,726 --> 00:24:48,025
I'm going to tell Gam.

462
00:24:48,027 --> 00:24:49,363
Gam, guess what?

463
00:24:50,831 --> 00:24:52,997
I'm still mad at you.

464
00:24:52,999 --> 00:24:54,232
Sorry I couldn't tell you

465
00:24:54,234 --> 00:24:55,167
about the bed and
breakfast thing.

466
00:24:55,169 --> 00:24:56,935
Your dad made me promise.

467
00:24:58,471 --> 00:24:59,638
Yeah, no, that's fine.

468
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,539
You cool off.

469
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:01,876
I'll chat later.

470
00:25:04,644 --> 00:25:06,211
Gammy, we're staying!

471
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,446
We're staying!

472
00:25:07,448 --> 00:25:08,679
I get to stay here
with you and Tanner!

473
00:25:08,681 --> 00:25:11,116
Oh, petal,
that is wonderful!

474
00:25:11,118 --> 00:25:12,417
Okay, so I'm thinking
that I'm gonna be

475
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:13,584
in charge of Tanner.

476
00:25:13,586 --> 00:25:14,785
I mean, not in
charge or anything,

477
00:25:14,787 --> 00:25:16,722
but I'm gonna make
sure that he's brushed

478
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:18,322
and fed and exercised and stuff,

479
00:25:18,324 --> 00:25:21,126
but you have to help me
convince Mom to let me ride him.

480
00:25:21,128 --> 00:25:24,862
Never mind about
the horse, Amanda.

481
00:25:24,864 --> 00:25:27,465
Ugh, that's a lawsuit
waiting to happen.

482
00:25:27,467 --> 00:25:29,967
We need to figure out how to
run this bed and breakfast.

483
00:25:29,969 --> 00:25:32,870
Come on, Mom, he's
not exercised...

484
00:25:32,872 --> 00:25:34,638
Wait, what bed and breakfast?

485
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,940
It's a long story,

486
00:25:35,942 --> 00:25:38,976
apparently part of Pop's
master plan.

487
00:25:38,978 --> 00:25:41,580
He's taken his home and made
it into a bed and breakfast

488
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:42,848
for us to run.

489
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:44,116
So did you quit?

490
00:25:44,118 --> 00:25:45,852
No, I took a leave.

491
00:25:46,853 --> 00:25:48,352
They're not thrilled,

492
00:25:48,354 --> 00:25:52,256
but losing Dad seemed to
have given me some leeway.

493
00:25:52,258 --> 00:25:53,724
It's not permanent,

494
00:25:53,726 --> 00:25:55,359
but we'll help Gam get
this place up and running,

495
00:25:55,361 --> 00:25:57,061
and then we have to go back.

496
00:25:57,063 --> 00:25:58,429
Gam, are you hearing this?

497
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:00,064
Oh, yes, I'm so glad

498
00:26:00,066 --> 00:26:01,800
that you and Tanner
are getting along.

499
00:26:01,802 --> 00:26:04,168
Apparently this is gonna
take longer than I thought.

500
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,971
She'll be all right.

501
00:26:05,973 --> 00:26:08,039
Your Pops really did
set it up for you guys.

502
00:26:08,041 --> 00:26:10,442
Is this really the best
time for you to just jump in?

503
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:13,878
I'm not really sure you've
shown you have a best time.

504
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,112
What does that mean?

505
00:26:15,114 --> 00:26:17,014
I think you
know what it means.

506
00:26:17,016 --> 00:26:17,916
Look, I'm just trying to help.

507
00:26:17,918 --> 00:26:19,184
I don't understand...

508
00:26:19,186 --> 00:26:20,685
What are
you looking at, Gam?

509
00:26:20,687 --> 00:26:23,455
Looks like my fairy friends
are throwing another party.

510
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:24,523
She's my daughter.

511
00:26:24,525 --> 00:26:25,791
- Fairies.
- I make the decision.

512
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:27,091
- Oh my, yes.
- You're not listening.

513
00:26:27,093 --> 00:26:29,764
Can't us
see them there?

514
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:32,930
Mom, come look!

515
00:26:32,932 --> 00:26:34,465
The forest has fairies in it.

516
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,201
You know, I knew I heard
voices when I was in there.

517
00:26:37,737 --> 00:26:40,272
Mom, please don't fill
her head with nonsense.

518
00:26:40,274 --> 00:26:42,040
Just because you
choose not to see them

519
00:26:42,042 --> 00:26:44,544
doesn't mean they aren't real.

520
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:46,977
Dylan, have you seen them?

521
00:26:46,979 --> 00:26:48,713
Oh no, I don't
go in that forest.

522
00:26:48,715 --> 00:26:50,215
It's haunted.

523
00:26:50,217 --> 00:26:51,483
That's the smartest
thing you've said

524
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:52,951
since you've been here.

525
00:26:52,953 --> 00:26:54,753
Amanda, you stay
out of there too.

526
00:26:54,755 --> 00:26:55,753
What?

527
00:26:55,755 --> 00:26:56,754
- No way.
- You wanna hear smart?

528
00:26:56,756 --> 00:26:57,988
I'll tell you smart.

529
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,925
How about you learn to
raise your daughter?

530
00:26:59,927 --> 00:27:01,392
Your daughter knows

531
00:27:01,394 --> 00:27:02,828
- how to ride a horse.
- Uh, hellO, excuse me.

532
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,029
I've seen her,
I've seen her ride the horse.

533
00:27:04,031 --> 00:27:05,429
Of course she
can ride the horse,

534
00:27:05,431 --> 00:27:06,231
- she's had lessons.
- So what's the big deal?

535
00:27:06,233 --> 00:27:07,365
She can ride the horse.

536
00:27:07,367 --> 00:27:08,166
- Just give her a chance.
- Uh, excuse me?

537
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,067
Easy?

538
00:27:09,069 --> 00:27:10,234
It's not that easy.

539
00:27:10,236 --> 00:27:10,901
Stop yelling
at me, I don't...

540
00:27:13,172 --> 00:27:14,638
Hi there.

541
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,109
Uh, I'm sorry to disturb
you, but are you guys open?

542
00:27:18,111 --> 00:27:21,847
Oh, yeah, your dad did
have me distribute those.

543
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:26,952
Sorry, we're really
in the beginning stages.

544
00:27:26,954 --> 00:27:29,487
But I can take your name and
number and I can call you back.

545
00:27:29,489 --> 00:27:30,421
- I just...
- Yeah, that's fine.

546
00:27:30,423 --> 00:27:32,859
I just need a...

547
00:27:35,996 --> 00:27:36,962
Your name, sir?

548
00:27:36,964 --> 00:27:38,429
Uh, Turk.

549
00:27:38,431 --> 00:27:39,933
Uh, Turk Peterson.

550
00:27:44,403 --> 00:27:46,504
Little Turkey Pete?

551
00:27:46,506 --> 00:27:47,539
Hey, Patricia.

552
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:48,807
Oh my gosh.

553
00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:51,176
I haven't seen you
in like 20 years.

554
00:27:51,178 --> 00:27:52,644
Yeah, 20 years
sounds about right.

555
00:27:52,646 --> 00:27:54,612
And wow, like, you look great.

556
00:27:54,614 --> 00:27:55,647
Thank you.

557
00:27:55,649 --> 00:27:57,249
You too, you look great.

558
00:27:57,251 --> 00:27:58,516
I see you got your braces off.

559
00:27:58,518 --> 00:27:59,751
Yeah, well, I wanted
to keep them on,

560
00:27:59,753 --> 00:28:01,552
but the dentist said
20 years was overkill,

561
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:04,255
so what can you do?

562
00:28:04,257 --> 00:28:06,090
Well, your teeth look great.

563
00:28:06,092 --> 00:28:07,492
I mean, not just your teeth.

564
00:28:07,494 --> 00:28:09,063
You all look great.

565
00:28:10,596 --> 00:28:11,862
What are you doing here?

566
00:28:11,864 --> 00:28:13,665
Doesn't your parents
live down the road?

567
00:28:13,667 --> 00:28:15,766
Yeah,
I guess they are

568
00:28:15,768 --> 00:28:16,734
just down there, aren't they?

569
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:17,572
Uh...

570
00:28:19,505 --> 00:28:23,073
You know what,
I'm just gonna come clean.

571
00:28:23,075 --> 00:28:25,810
I heard you were in the area
and I wanted to come see you.

572
00:28:25,812 --> 00:28:27,078
Oh.

573
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,348
So, um, how was
it riding Tanner?

574
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,817
Isn't it fun doing something
you're not supposed to?

575
00:28:32,819 --> 00:28:34,252
Yeah.

576
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,753
I thought you'd be
alone, and I'm came here,

577
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:37,821
and everybody was here
and I got all nervous,

578
00:28:37,823 --> 00:28:41,126
and I panicked, and now
I'm really embarrassed.

579
00:28:41,128 --> 00:28:43,661
You know what, I'm just
gonna go, actually, um...

580
00:28:43,663 --> 00:28:45,397
It's fine.

581
00:28:45,399 --> 00:28:46,932
Oh, I'll take fine.

582
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:48,532
Fine's better than crazy, right?

583
00:28:48,534 --> 00:28:49,667
Yeah.

584
00:28:49,669 --> 00:28:51,505
So, um, would you...

585
00:28:53,306 --> 00:28:55,240
Uh, uh, would...

586
00:28:55,242 --> 00:28:56,474
Oh, right.

587
00:28:56,476 --> 00:28:58,979
Yeah, no, I, I got
stuff I can do.

588
00:29:00,581 --> 00:29:02,246
Sorry, what were you saying?

589
00:29:02,248 --> 00:29:06,318
He's about to ask you
out to lunch.

590
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,619
- Mom!
- No, no, she's right.

591
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:11,822
She's abrupt, but, uh, right.

592
00:29:11,824 --> 00:29:12,991
So what do you say?

593
00:29:12,993 --> 00:29:15,593
Would you like to go for lunch?

594
00:29:15,595 --> 00:29:17,161
Sure.

595
00:29:17,163 --> 00:29:18,396
That sounds great.

596
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:20,197
Oh, great, oh, thank
you for saying yes.

597
00:29:20,199 --> 00:29:22,199
Uh, would one work?

598
00:29:22,201 --> 00:29:23,734
- Sure.
- Great.

599
00:29:23,736 --> 00:29:27,105
Uh, wow, I just realized we
keep saying great a lot, um,

600
00:29:27,107 --> 00:29:28,340
- okay, I'll see you at one.
- Leave.

601
00:29:28,342 --> 00:29:30,308
Maybe,
yeah, yeah, okay.

602
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,509
I'll just go.

603
00:29:31,511 --> 00:29:32,346
Bye.

604
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,715
Hmm.

605
00:30:16,122 --> 00:30:18,455
Hey, Turk,
I'll be right there.

606
00:30:18,457 --> 00:30:19,491
Uh, sure thing.

607
00:30:19,493 --> 00:30:21,062
Uh, take your time.

608
00:30:35,641 --> 00:30:36,808
Hey.

609
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:39,109
I'm taking her out right now.

610
00:30:39,111 --> 00:30:41,378
No, no, I don't think
she'll be any trouble.

611
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,447
Um, if you leave it with me,

612
00:30:43,449 --> 00:30:46,150
I promise we'll start this demo.

613
00:30:46,152 --> 00:30:50,323
Okay, hello, hello?

614
00:30:51,323 --> 00:30:53,159
Oh, um, Ashley, right?

615
00:30:54,861 --> 00:30:55,793
Amanda.

616
00:30:55,795 --> 00:30:57,028
Ah, right, right, Amanda.

617
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,429
Um, I don't know if you heard.

618
00:30:58,431 --> 00:31:01,532
I was just, uh, having a
conversation with, uh, my buddy.

619
00:31:01,534 --> 00:31:03,400
So what are you
planning on demoing?

620
00:31:03,402 --> 00:31:06,236
My
buddy is in a band,

621
00:31:06,238 --> 00:31:08,973
and, uh, I'm producing the demo.

622
00:31:08,975 --> 00:31:12,609
Right, and why would
my mom be any trouble?

623
00:31:12,611 --> 00:31:14,111
You know what, Amanda,

624
00:31:14,113 --> 00:31:16,447
what if we keep this demo
talk between you and me,

625
00:31:16,449 --> 00:31:18,082
and I give you some money,

626
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:20,017
maybe for a new
saddle for your horse?

627
00:31:20,019 --> 00:31:21,218
Your horse could use
a new saddle, I see.

628
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,486
Mom, Mom!

629
00:31:22,488 --> 00:31:24,589
Oh, no, you don't need Mom.

630
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:26,590
No, no, you stay
right here, all right.

631
00:31:26,592 --> 00:31:29,029
Hey, hey, come back, come on!

632
00:31:38,505 --> 00:31:40,003
Did I hear Amanda?

633
00:31:40,005 --> 00:31:42,107
Yeah, she said something
about going on a walk,

634
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:43,574
but not to worry about her

635
00:31:43,576 --> 00:31:45,744
and to buy you something
nice for lunch.

636
00:31:45,746 --> 00:31:46,910
She's a handful, that one.

637
00:31:46,912 --> 00:31:48,582
Oh, I can imagine.

638
00:31:50,316 --> 00:31:51,818
I'll get the door.

639
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,125
Thanks.

640
00:32:19,746 --> 00:32:21,549
Hey, kid, you alive?

641
00:32:23,917 --> 00:32:25,582
Yeah, I think so.

642
00:32:25,584 --> 00:32:27,619
Man, you really
cracked into that branch.

643
00:32:27,621 --> 00:32:29,320
I tried to warn you.

644
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:30,789
I thought you were a ghost.

645
00:32:30,791 --> 00:32:32,389
Ghost?

646
00:32:32,391 --> 00:32:33,925
How crazy would that be?

647
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,900
You're a fairy.

648
00:32:42,902 --> 00:32:45,936
I bet it was the wings
that tipped you off, huh?

649
00:32:45,938 --> 00:32:48,173
Are you gonna hurt me?

650
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:49,439
Are you serious?

651
00:32:49,441 --> 00:32:51,208
You're like 1,000
feet taller than me.

652
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,543
Plus you have this giant horse.

653
00:32:55,982 --> 00:32:57,682
This is Tanner.

654
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,117
Hi, Tanner, I'm Cali.

655
00:33:00,786 --> 00:33:01,886
What's that?

656
00:33:01,888 --> 00:33:03,021
Is that right?

657
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:04,088
Did she really say that?

658
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:05,423
She's here to do what?

659
00:33:05,425 --> 00:33:07,891
What? What is he saying?

660
00:33:07,893 --> 00:33:10,061
I have no idea.

661
00:33:10,063 --> 00:33:11,462
I can't talk to horses.

662
00:33:11,464 --> 00:33:12,996
Come on, let's get
you all cleaned up.

663
00:33:46,867 --> 00:33:47,999
I must be dreaming.

664
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,336
Nope, no dream.

665
00:33:51,338 --> 00:33:54,809
Come on, my house is
just right over here.

666
00:33:58,578 --> 00:33:59,776
Nothing to see here, folks,

667
00:33:59,778 --> 00:34:02,849
just a giant girl
with a cracked noggin.

668
00:34:09,421 --> 00:34:11,823
Cali, what do you
think you're doing?

669
00:34:11,825 --> 00:34:14,459
Relax, McKenna, I'm
just giving this girl...

670
00:34:14,461 --> 00:34:15,559
Amanda.

671
00:34:15,561 --> 00:34:17,262
Amanda here
something for her head.

672
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:20,265
You can't just be
bringing aways here.

673
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:21,298
Aways?

674
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,033
Like away from here.

675
00:34:23,035 --> 00:34:25,135
It's what some of the
ruder fairies call you.

676
00:34:25,137 --> 00:34:26,406
Gimme a second.

677
00:34:29,142 --> 00:34:31,776
You know what Aleeda said.

678
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:32,910
What do you want me to do,

679
00:34:32,912 --> 00:34:34,611
leave her unconscious
in the forest?

680
00:34:34,613 --> 00:34:36,513
I'll clean her up and
send her on her way.

681
00:34:36,515 --> 00:34:38,283
I'm telling Aleeda.

682
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:39,617
Nothing personal.

683
00:34:40,854 --> 00:34:43,153
So how long have
you guys been here?

684
00:34:43,155 --> 00:34:44,090
Not sure.

685
00:34:45,258 --> 00:34:47,858
As far back as I can
remember, anyway.

686
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:50,495
Aleeda and some others
came over on a boat.

687
00:34:50,497 --> 00:34:53,231
Others just sort of
got here, you know?

688
00:34:53,233 --> 00:34:55,903
Bang-o.

689
00:34:59,738 --> 00:35:01,842
Slap this on your noggin.

690
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:06,611
Ow.

691
00:35:06,613 --> 00:35:08,479
Yeah, it's got a sting to it.

692
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,013
But you'll feel
better in the morning.

693
00:35:10,015 --> 00:35:11,615
Cali, Cali!

694
00:35:11,617 --> 00:35:13,084
Cali, did you hear?

695
00:35:13,086 --> 00:35:15,919
One of the fairies brought
an away to the village!

696
00:35:15,921 --> 00:35:16,720
Hello.

697
00:35:16,722 --> 00:35:17,588
Hello.

698
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,193
Oh man, the away.

699
00:35:21,427 --> 00:35:24,428
Amanda, this is
Harper and Emilyn.

700
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:26,097
One of them is smarter
than the other.

701
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:28,365
Oh, thanks, Cali.

702
00:35:28,367 --> 00:35:29,901
Nice to meet you.

703
00:35:29,903 --> 00:35:31,269
Nice to meet you too.

704
00:35:31,271 --> 00:35:32,803
I like the flowers in your hair.

705
00:35:32,805 --> 00:35:35,238
Thanks, we call them
friendship flowers.

706
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,941
We make them for each other.

707
00:35:36,943 --> 00:35:37,874
You want one?

708
00:35:37,876 --> 00:35:38,876
We'd have to be friends first,

709
00:35:38,878 --> 00:35:40,778
but then we could make you one.

710
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,180
Sure.

711
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:43,914
This place is incredible.

712
00:35:43,916 --> 00:35:45,749
Yeah, we like it.

713
00:35:45,751 --> 00:35:47,751
That's our place over there.

714
00:35:47,753 --> 00:35:51,155
Since we're best friends
now, you can come over.

715
00:35:51,157 --> 00:35:55,492
You may need to stay
outside, though.

716
00:35:55,494 --> 00:35:56,660
Cool.

717
00:35:56,662 --> 00:35:58,129
The one beside is McKenna's.

718
00:35:58,131 --> 00:36:00,932
Don't knock on her door unless
you like being yelled at.

719
00:36:00,934 --> 00:36:03,604
Which would be weird if you did.

720
00:36:04,671 --> 00:36:05,970
Whose house is that?

721
00:36:05,972 --> 00:36:08,205
That house isn't ready yet.

722
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:09,640
What do you mean?

723
00:36:09,642 --> 00:36:12,744
A fairy door won't open until
the fairy inside is ready.

724
00:36:12,746 --> 00:36:15,178
That fairy's not ready.

725
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,814
There, see?

726
00:36:16,816 --> 00:36:18,216
Quick, hide in our house.

727
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:19,584
Uh.

728
00:36:19,586 --> 00:36:21,488
Let me move some stuff.

729
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,321
Told you she brought one.

730
00:36:24,323 --> 00:36:27,858
Yes, McKenna,
hard not to see her.

731
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:30,028
Cali, explain yourself.

732
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:32,562
Before you get too
upset, I know the rules.

733
00:36:32,564 --> 00:36:33,997
But Amanda was riding
through the forest

734
00:36:33,999 --> 00:36:35,533
and smacked her noggin.

735
00:36:35,535 --> 00:36:37,234
I couldn't just let
her die, could I?

736
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:38,635
You risked all of us, Cali.

737
00:36:38,637 --> 00:36:40,771
Oh, please, why are
we so afraid of them?

738
00:36:40,773 --> 00:36:43,209
Girls, that's quite enough.

739
00:36:44,644 --> 00:36:46,209
How's your head, little girl?

740
00:36:46,211 --> 00:36:48,715
Much better, thanks to Cali.

741
00:36:50,617 --> 00:36:54,718
You remind me of someone
I knew a long time ago.

742
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,887
Thanks, I guess.

743
00:36:56,889 --> 00:36:59,090
Tell me, what brought
you through our forest

744
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:01,191
at such great speeds?

745
00:37:01,193 --> 00:37:02,693
I almost forgot.

746
00:37:02,695 --> 00:37:04,562
There was this guy, Turk,
and he's dating my mom,

747
00:37:04,564 --> 00:37:07,097
and I heard him on the
phone talking about demos,

748
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:08,698
and then he grabbed me.

749
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,033
He grabbed you?

750
00:37:10,035 --> 00:37:13,137
Well, he tried,
but I ran away.

751
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:15,872
What they do is
no business of ours.

752
00:37:15,874 --> 00:37:19,609
As much as I see this
pains you, McKenna's right.

753
00:37:19,611 --> 00:37:21,079
We don't interfere
with what goes on

754
00:37:21,081 --> 00:37:22,780
outside the forest walls.

755
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:26,149
Aleeda, Amanda
might be in danger.

756
00:37:26,151 --> 00:37:28,486
My decision is final.

757
00:37:28,488 --> 00:37:31,655
I have my reasons
for staying out.

758
00:37:31,657 --> 00:37:34,591
I must also forbid any
further contact with Amanda.

759
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,497
Amanda?

760
00:37:40,499 --> 00:37:41,834
That's my mom.

761
00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:02,253
There you are.

762
00:38:02,255 --> 00:38:03,187
We've been worried.

763
00:38:03,189 --> 00:38:04,488
We've been searching for you.

764
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,622
Don't freak out.

765
00:38:05,624 --> 00:38:07,158
What
happened to your head?

766
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,258
We gotta take you
to the hospital.

767
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,029
No, Mom, it's fine.

768
00:38:12,131 --> 00:38:13,597
She helped me.

769
00:38:16,068 --> 00:38:17,468
Who helped you?

770
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,972
Cali, the fairy.

771
00:38:19,872 --> 00:38:20,706
What?

772
00:38:22,242 --> 00:38:23,707
What's wrong?

773
00:38:23,709 --> 00:38:25,309
She can't see us.

774
00:38:25,311 --> 00:38:26,144
What?

775
00:38:26,146 --> 00:38:27,778
She's in between.

776
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,713
Not young enough
to believe in us.

777
00:38:29,715 --> 00:38:32,916
Not old enough
to believe again.

778
00:38:32,918 --> 00:38:35,855
Sweetie, you're
talking nonsense.

779
00:38:36,756 --> 00:38:38,021
- Wait.
- Come on.

780
00:38:38,023 --> 00:38:38,955
I have to
tell you about Turk.

781
00:38:38,957 --> 00:38:40,191
There she is.

782
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:41,858
Amanda, are you okay?

783
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,227
We were worried about you.

784
00:38:43,229 --> 00:38:44,995
I heard him on the phone.

785
00:38:44,997 --> 00:38:46,263
He's up to something.

786
00:38:46,265 --> 00:38:47,101
What?

787
00:38:48,334 --> 00:38:50,233
I have no idea what
she's talking about.

788
00:38:50,235 --> 00:38:52,202
I don't like this guy one bit.

789
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:54,805
He tried to pay me
to keep it a secret.

790
00:38:54,807 --> 00:38:56,374
What is going on?

791
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:58,242
Okay, you got me.

792
00:38:59,512 --> 00:39:01,144
I saw Amanda on the
horse the other day,

793
00:39:01,146 --> 00:39:02,747
and she asked me to
keep it a secret.

794
00:39:02,749 --> 00:39:04,182
I'm sorry, Amanda,
I gotta come clean.

795
00:39:04,184 --> 00:39:05,416
Are you kidding me?

796
00:39:05,418 --> 00:39:06,950
I feel bad.

797
00:39:06,952 --> 00:39:10,354
I see what happened now, and
I just, this is my fault.

798
00:39:10,356 --> 00:39:12,289
He was on the phone
talking about demolition.

799
00:39:12,291 --> 00:39:13,256
Demolition?

800
00:39:13,258 --> 00:39:14,658
You believe me, don't you?

801
00:39:16,528 --> 00:39:19,162
Sweetie, you were just
talking about seeing a fairy.

802
00:39:19,164 --> 00:39:20,263
Mom.

803
00:39:21,601 --> 00:39:23,533
You're unbelievable.

804
00:39:23,535 --> 00:39:25,202
Amanda!

805
00:39:27,072 --> 00:39:28,638
Easy, boy.

806
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,274
Just let her blow
off some steam, okay?

807
00:39:31,276 --> 00:39:34,010
I'm gonna take Tanner
back to the stables.

808
00:39:34,012 --> 00:39:35,512
Thanks, Dylan.

809
00:39:35,514 --> 00:39:36,780
Listen, I'm sorry.

810
00:39:36,782 --> 00:39:38,216
No, it's my fault.

811
00:39:38,218 --> 00:39:40,850
She's under a lot of stress
lately, she's acting up.

812
00:39:40,852 --> 00:39:43,954
No, no, you don't need any
more responsibility, all right?

813
00:39:43,956 --> 00:39:46,459
You have enough on your plate.

814
00:39:48,293 --> 00:39:49,926
You're a good guy.

815
00:39:49,928 --> 00:39:50,760
Aw.

816
00:39:50,762 --> 00:39:51,762
Come on.

817
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:52,932
I really am.

818
00:39:59,905 --> 00:40:00,740
Ow.

819
00:40:08,146 --> 00:40:10,381
I just, I
don't know what to do.

820
00:40:10,383 --> 00:40:12,316
I just thought I was doing the
right thing by staying here,

821
00:40:12,318 --> 00:40:14,684
but this is all out of control.

822
00:40:14,686 --> 00:40:16,153
She'll sleep it off.

823
00:40:16,155 --> 00:40:18,122
And all this
nonsense with fairies?

824
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,490
I swear, my mom's
filling her head.

825
00:40:20,492 --> 00:40:24,495
Ugh, I haven't even started
getting this place ready.

826
00:40:24,497 --> 00:40:25,729
What am I doing?

827
00:40:25,731 --> 00:40:27,131
Tell you what.

828
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,399
I'll come by in the morning
and give you a hand.

829
00:40:28,401 --> 00:40:30,166
Oh, no, I
couldn't ask you to...

830
00:40:30,168 --> 00:40:31,869
No, it's
already settled.

831
00:40:31,871 --> 00:40:33,903
You're a lifesaver.

832
00:40:33,905 --> 00:40:36,941
Hey, do you wanna
go get some coffee?

833
00:40:36,943 --> 00:40:39,276
Coffee sounds great.

834
00:40:48,688 --> 00:40:49,519
Amanda!

835
00:40:53,126 --> 00:40:53,957
What are you guys doing here?

836
00:40:56,028 --> 00:40:58,095
That's exactly
what I keep asking.

837
00:40:58,097 --> 00:40:59,396
Relax.

838
00:40:59,398 --> 00:41:01,564
We just wanted to
make sure you're okay.

839
00:41:01,566 --> 00:41:03,401
I guess I'm all right.

840
00:41:03,403 --> 00:41:04,669
We talked it over,

841
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:06,604
and we decided we're
going to help you.

842
00:41:06,606 --> 00:41:07,437
Really?

843
00:41:07,439 --> 00:41:08,773
All of you?

844
00:41:08,775 --> 00:41:12,175
Well, no, not all of
us, but the four of us.

845
00:41:12,177 --> 00:41:13,510
That's better than
nothing, right?

846
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:15,680
For the record,
I'm not here to help.

847
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:16,981
I'm here to keep a
logistical record

848
00:41:16,983 --> 00:41:19,450
of the events that transpire.

849
00:41:19,452 --> 00:41:22,253
I don't know what that
means, but we wanna help.

850
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:26,624
Thank you so much,
guys, but what can we do?

851
00:41:26,626 --> 00:41:28,626
My mom thinks I'm
just imagining you.

852
00:41:28,628 --> 00:41:29,894
Let's keep it that way.

853
00:41:29,896 --> 00:41:30,961
Meet us at the pond.

854
00:41:30,963 --> 00:41:32,762
That'll be our meeting place.

855
00:41:32,764 --> 00:41:36,566
Oh, I've always wanted
a secret meeting place!

856
00:41:36,568 --> 00:41:38,269
Emilyn, how long
have I been saying

857
00:41:38,271 --> 00:41:39,836
we should have a
secret meeting place?

858
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:41,037
A long time.

859
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:41,939
High five!

860
00:41:42,775 --> 00:41:44,008
Wing high five!

861
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,613
Okay, see you tomorrow.

862
00:41:50,615 --> 00:41:52,450
See you tomorrow.

863
00:41:53,418 --> 00:41:55,554
Oh, here, I almost forgot.

864
00:41:58,157 --> 00:41:59,622
You made this for me?

865
00:41:59,624 --> 00:42:03,496
Of course, you're our
friend, aren't ya?

866
00:42:05,631 --> 00:42:08,735
For the record,
we are not friends.

867
00:42:22,682 --> 00:42:23,513
More coffee, sir?

868
00:42:23,515 --> 00:42:25,015
Oh, you startled me.

869
00:42:25,017 --> 00:42:26,816
Uh, yes, please.

870
00:42:26,818 --> 00:42:28,352
Sorry, just making my rounds.

871
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:32,957
Good morning, Mr. Peterson.

872
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:36,994
Ah, everybody's sneaking
up on me this morning.

873
00:42:36,996 --> 00:42:38,662
Is it the shoes?
You're like a ninja.

874
00:42:38,664 --> 00:42:40,030
I should get a pair like those.

875
00:42:40,032 --> 00:42:41,599
Where'd you get 'em at?

876
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:44,934
Where is our
money, Mr. Peterson?

877
00:42:44,936 --> 00:42:47,171
Well, you're gonna
like this, 'cause I got...

878
00:42:47,173 --> 00:42:48,608
Finish chewing.

879
00:42:52,912 --> 00:42:54,577
Sorry.

880
00:42:54,579 --> 00:42:56,414
Uh, good news is it's coming.

881
00:42:56,416 --> 00:42:58,615
I know I had a bit of a
rough patch with the dad,

882
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:01,452
but now I'm kind of,
uh, wooing the daughter,

883
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:03,220
and I think it's safe
to say without a doubt

884
00:43:03,222 --> 00:43:05,222
that she's probably gonna
sell the farm to me.

885
00:43:05,224 --> 00:43:06,590
So that's good for you,

886
00:43:06,592 --> 00:43:10,461
because then you
get your money back.

887
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,229
Nothing, huh? You're
just like a rock.

888
00:43:12,231 --> 00:43:13,463
You're a hard read.

889
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:14,932
I don't know what's
going on in that head.

890
00:43:14,934 --> 00:43:16,169
Mr. Peterson,

891
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:21,274
you and I are involved in
an A, B, and C situation.

892
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:26,313
A is the borrowing of
my money, which you did.

893
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:33,819
B is the spending of my
money, which you also did.

894
00:43:36,289 --> 00:43:39,359
And C is the paying
back of my money,

895
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:42,425
which you have not.

896
00:43:42,427 --> 00:43:45,296
Which part of those letters
involves me listening

897
00:43:45,298 --> 00:43:47,698
to you going on dates?

898
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:51,734
Well, I see what you're
interested in.

899
00:43:51,736 --> 00:43:54,905
Uh, 'cause I meant like
C, like the letter,

900
00:43:54,907 --> 00:43:57,307
'cause of what,
uh, are you hungry?

901
00:43:57,309 --> 00:43:58,843
They make a mean omelet here.

902
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:00,644
It's, I don't know what's
in it for the life of me,

903
00:44:00,646 --> 00:44:02,713
but the chickens are
like made out of gold.

904
00:44:02,715 --> 00:44:04,080
Oh, take it, no, take
it easy, take it...

905
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:11,055
When you first came
to us with this solution

906
00:44:11,057 --> 00:44:15,124
to your money problems,
you said it was,

907
00:44:15,126 --> 00:44:17,061
how did you put it?

908
00:44:17,063 --> 00:44:18,062
In the bag.

909
00:44:18,064 --> 00:44:19,162
But I thought it was, I...

910
00:44:19,164 --> 00:44:20,099
Be quiet.

911
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,867
It's terrible manners to speak

912
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:24,934
when someone else is speaking.

913
00:44:24,936 --> 00:44:26,437
Sometimes just
things don't always go

914
00:44:26,439 --> 00:44:27,370
according to plan, you know...

915
00:44:27,372 --> 00:44:29,006
Mornin', darlin'.

916
00:44:29,008 --> 00:44:31,341
There's the smile
I came in here for.

917
00:44:31,343 --> 00:44:33,343
Flattery won't
get you free coffee, Charlie.

918
00:44:33,345 --> 00:44:35,945
Well, I can
give you a song and dance too

919
00:44:35,947 --> 00:44:37,515
if you like.

920
00:44:37,517 --> 00:44:38,782
Mornin', Turk.

921
00:44:38,784 --> 00:44:42,285
Morning, Sheriff.

922
00:44:53,064 --> 00:44:54,664
Turk, don't you
want your breakfast?

923
00:44:54,666 --> 00:44:57,536
No, I'm
not really hungry.

924
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,207
Is that
one button or two

925
00:45:03,209 --> 00:45:04,941
that you stole from the village?

926
00:45:04,943 --> 00:45:07,077
Why do you automatically
assume I stole them?

927
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,546
Maybe I found these.

928
00:45:08,548 --> 00:45:09,747
How many?

929
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:11,849
One.

930
00:45:11,851 --> 00:45:13,753
Looks like two to me.

931
00:45:14,686 --> 00:45:15,686
One.

932
00:45:17,055 --> 00:45:18,555
You tried to kill me.

933
00:45:18,557 --> 00:45:20,524
Under the Order of
Fairy, section three,

934
00:45:20,526 --> 00:45:21,992
any act of violence

935
00:45:21,994 --> 00:45:24,428
against another fairy
shall be considered, whoa!

936
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,662
Now it's none.

937
00:45:25,664 --> 00:45:28,101
And stop accusing
me of stealing.

938
00:45:30,235 --> 00:45:35,171
So she had two in the
sack, but then she threw one.

939
00:45:35,173 --> 00:45:37,943
And then she
threw another one.

940
00:45:39,211 --> 00:45:41,544
Math is hard.

941
00:45:41,546 --> 00:45:43,347
Hi, how's it going?

942
00:45:43,349 --> 00:45:44,981
You're wearing the flower.

943
00:45:44,983 --> 00:45:46,584
Yeah, I made one for Tanner.

944
00:45:46,586 --> 00:45:49,119
I know I'm not a fairy or
anything, so I hope it's okay.

945
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:50,454
Of course it is.

946
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:51,955
Wow, good job.

947
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:54,091
Maybe you are a fairy and
you just don't know it.

948
00:45:54,093 --> 00:45:58,198
Whoa, mind
blown.

949
00:45:59,664 --> 00:46:01,698
All right, I have
it all figured out.

950
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:04,233
We know he's up to
something, right?

951
00:46:04,235 --> 00:46:05,468
Right.

952
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:06,903
But since we don't
know what that is,

953
00:46:06,905 --> 00:46:08,571
we just need to
make him go away.

954
00:46:08,573 --> 00:46:10,506
Okay, how do we do that?

955
00:46:10,508 --> 00:46:14,378
I stole a bunch of stuff
from Aleeda to help us.

956
00:46:15,648 --> 00:46:18,584
Come on, we have a
lot of work to do.

957
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:21,117
Thanks for coming.

958
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:22,553
There's a lot to do around here.

959
00:46:22,555 --> 00:46:24,088
Oh, I'm happy to lend a hand.

960
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:25,990
How can I help you?

961
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:30,327
Well, you can take
this into the stable.

962
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:31,394
Thanks.

963
00:46:31,396 --> 00:46:32,762
You're a lifesaver.

964
00:46:37,403 --> 00:46:38,836
I really hope this works.

965
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:40,104
Of course it's going to work.

966
00:46:40,106 --> 00:46:41,675
Sit back and watch.

967
00:46:51,483 --> 00:46:53,719
Whoa, you're a big fella.

968
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:02,725
Well, you must be
friends with Amanda.

969
00:47:02,727 --> 00:47:05,796
You picked the
losing side, horse.

970
00:47:06,631 --> 00:47:08,233
Whoa, what is that?

971
00:47:13,005 --> 00:47:14,006
Aw, come on.

972
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:28,651
Oh, you think that's funny, huh?

973
00:47:28,653 --> 00:47:29,919
We'll see if you're laughing

974
00:47:29,921 --> 00:47:31,387
when I send you to
the glue factory.

975
00:47:33,659 --> 00:47:36,026
Okay, I made a bunny ear.

976
00:47:36,028 --> 00:47:38,162
Oh, I
made a rabbit ear.

977
00:47:38,164 --> 00:47:39,566
This should work.

978
00:47:55,146 --> 00:47:57,814
Your chair might be a
little bit more comfortable.

979
00:47:57,816 --> 00:47:59,283
Yeah, I fell.

980
00:47:59,285 --> 00:48:00,517
You all right?

981
00:48:00,519 --> 00:48:03,423
No, something tied
my shoes together.

982
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:06,256
Don't look at me
like that, all right.

983
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:08,591
I don't know what it was,
but something tied my shoes.

984
00:48:08,593 --> 00:48:10,359
Nobody ever listens to me.

985
00:48:10,361 --> 00:48:11,729
Listens to you about what?

986
00:48:11,731 --> 00:48:14,097
I keep telling people
this forest is haunted.

987
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:17,300
What, like ghosts?

988
00:48:17,302 --> 00:48:18,702
Yeah, I've seen 'em.

989
00:48:18,704 --> 00:48:21,338
Bouncing lights,
floating spirits.

990
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:22,405
Well, that, that's crazy.

991
00:48:22,407 --> 00:48:24,910
That's not, that can't happen.

992
00:48:28,546 --> 00:48:29,680
Yeah, that's my cue.

993
00:48:29,682 --> 00:48:30,513
What was that?

994
00:48:30,515 --> 00:48:31,450
Gonna go.

995
00:48:34,153 --> 00:48:36,120
Where, where are you
going, you leaving?

996
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:39,359
Whoa!

997
00:48:49,101 --> 00:48:49,932
Yes!

998
00:48:49,934 --> 00:48:50,934
Ow.

999
00:48:52,204 --> 00:48:54,972
And that's how you
get rid of someone.

1000
00:48:56,742 --> 00:48:57,608
Whoa.

1001
00:48:57,610 --> 00:48:58,709
Turk.

1002
00:48:58,711 --> 00:48:59,542
What is it?

1003
00:48:59,544 --> 00:49:00,646
What's wrong?

1004
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:05,716
You got
ghosts going on over there.

1005
00:49:06,785 --> 00:49:07,617
Ghosts?

1006
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:08,551
Yeah, yeah.

1007
00:49:08,553 --> 00:49:09,720
They came right after me.

1008
00:49:09,722 --> 00:49:11,187
All right, come over here.

1009
00:49:11,189 --> 00:49:13,923
We gotta get you cleaned up.

1010
00:49:13,925 --> 00:49:14,760
Come on.

1011
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:21,365
You know, I hate to think it,

1012
00:49:21,367 --> 00:49:24,734
but that ghost is
probably Amanda.

1013
00:49:24,736 --> 00:49:27,604
She has a unique way
of handling things.

1014
00:49:27,606 --> 00:49:30,740
Yeah, well, I don't think
she likes me very much.

1015
00:49:30,742 --> 00:49:31,941
Give her time.

1016
00:49:31,943 --> 00:49:34,680
Her and my dad
were really close.

1017
00:49:36,081 --> 00:49:39,283
Yeah, I suppose it's hard
when you lose someone you love.

1018
00:49:39,285 --> 00:49:40,517
Yeah.

1019
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:42,586
He meant a lot to her

1020
00:49:42,588 --> 00:49:45,421
Well, I was meaning you.

1021
00:49:47,726 --> 00:49:48,561
Mm.

1022
00:50:25,064 --> 00:50:28,432
It's been three
weeks and Turk is still here.

1023
00:50:32,637 --> 00:50:33,637
You have to
lay your hand flat

1024
00:50:33,639 --> 00:50:35,905
or the rock won't skip.

1025
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:37,506
My hand is flat.

1026
00:50:37,508 --> 00:50:39,675
Maybe it's too flat.

1027
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:45,448
No, like this, watch.

1028
00:50:47,452 --> 00:50:49,653
Hello, are you guys
even listening to me?

1029
00:50:49,655 --> 00:50:52,856
Sorry, we're trying
to get the hang of this.

1030
00:50:52,858 --> 00:50:54,457
Ooh!

1031
00:50:56,361 --> 00:50:57,827
Do you mind?

1032
00:50:57,829 --> 00:50:59,363
Why would I mind?

1033
00:50:59,365 --> 00:51:01,497
Yeah, you got wet,
you should mind.

1034
00:51:03,135 --> 00:51:05,371
She doesn't know herself.

1035
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,073
So what if he's going
out with your Mom?

1036
00:51:10,075 --> 00:51:11,742
Maybe that will be better.

1037
00:51:11,744 --> 00:51:13,209
I just don't trust him.

1038
00:51:13,211 --> 00:51:15,379
We have to figure out
how to get rid of him.

1039
00:51:15,381 --> 00:51:16,613
So this is why
you come down here,

1040
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,080
so you can talk to yourself?

1041
00:51:18,082 --> 00:51:19,850
Hey, Dylan, what
are you doing here?

1042
00:51:19,852 --> 00:51:21,050
I was going to the apple tree

1043
00:51:21,052 --> 00:51:22,551
to get some apples
for the other animals,

1044
00:51:22,553 --> 00:51:24,988
but it looks like somebody
here has cleared us all out.

1045
00:51:26,791 --> 00:51:28,325
Sorry, that's my fault.

1046
00:51:28,327 --> 00:51:29,526
Oh, yeah, that's your fault

1047
00:51:29,528 --> 00:51:31,294
for taking such
good care of Tanner.

1048
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:33,363
Kiddo, you've
been a lifesaver to me.

1049
00:51:33,365 --> 00:51:34,231
Really?

1050
00:51:34,233 --> 00:51:35,832
Yeah.

1051
00:51:35,834 --> 00:51:37,700
Your Pops ever tell
you how he got Tanner?

1052
00:51:37,702 --> 00:51:39,369
Oh, I love this story.

1053
00:51:39,371 --> 00:51:40,671
No, I didn't
even know about him

1054
00:51:40,673 --> 00:51:42,204
until I got here.

1055
00:51:42,206 --> 00:51:44,774
Well, your Pops and I
were running an errand

1056
00:51:44,776 --> 00:51:46,609
because Jean decided it was time

1057
00:51:46,611 --> 00:51:48,278
for her to learn how
to play the piano.

1058
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,879
Like most grandmothers do.

1059
00:51:49,881 --> 00:51:53,115
So we find one, we get it
all loaded up in my truck,

1060
00:51:53,117 --> 00:51:56,986
and we hear this guy,
this real nasty fella,

1061
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:59,425
just yelling and carrying on.

1062
00:52:00,592 --> 00:52:02,459
Your Pops being who he
is, goes around back

1063
00:52:02,461 --> 00:52:03,660
to see if he can help.

1064
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:05,528
Sounds like Pop.

1065
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:07,830
Turns out this guy
can't control his horse.

1066
00:52:07,832 --> 00:52:09,032
Figures the best
way to teach him is

1067
00:52:09,034 --> 00:52:11,702
to beat a lesson into him.

1068
00:52:11,704 --> 00:52:13,269
I'll be honest, I was
ready to do something

1069
00:52:13,271 --> 00:52:14,671
I wouldn't be proud of.

1070
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:17,774
But your Pops,
just cool as a cucumber.

1071
00:52:17,776 --> 00:52:19,175
Walks right over to this guy.

1072
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:20,410
Did Pops hit him?

1073
00:52:20,412 --> 00:52:23,814
No, he looks him in
the eye and he goes,

1074
00:52:23,816 --> 00:52:27,383
"You know the difference
between a guy beating a horse

1075
00:52:27,385 --> 00:52:30,586
"and a guy getting
beat up by an old man?"

1076
00:52:30,588 --> 00:52:31,823
Guy says, "No."

1077
00:52:32,925 --> 00:52:35,325
Pops says,
"Me neither."

1078
00:52:37,262 --> 00:52:38,729
The guy was so afraid of Pops,

1079
00:52:38,731 --> 00:52:41,597
he just handed over the
reins and walked away.

1080
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,332
So we ended up bringing
home the piano for Jean

1081
00:52:43,334 --> 00:52:45,769
and Tanner for Pops.

1082
00:52:45,771 --> 00:52:49,976
And now I think we brought
home Tanner for you too.

1083
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:53,075
Well, anyways, I better
get into the city

1084
00:52:53,077 --> 00:52:54,378
for some apples to eat.

1085
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:55,312
Do you need anything?

1086
00:52:55,314 --> 00:52:56,812
No, we're good, thanks, Dylan.

1087
00:52:56,814 --> 00:53:01,350
All right, well, I'll
see you back at the farm.

1088
00:53:01,352 --> 00:53:04,820
Why can't my
mom date a guy like that?

1089
00:53:04,822 --> 00:53:07,189
Okay, we have to
come up with a plan.

1090
00:53:07,191 --> 00:53:09,725
Now, I was thinking
we attack his money.

1091
00:53:09,727 --> 00:53:10,994
Mess with his car?

1092
00:53:10,996 --> 00:53:12,162
He'd have to keep
getting it fixed,

1093
00:53:12,164 --> 00:53:13,662
and it will cost a fortune.

1094
00:53:13,664 --> 00:53:15,731
Or we could hide one of
every pair of his socks.

1095
00:53:15,733 --> 00:53:17,767
- That's always a good one.
- Yeah!

1096
00:53:17,769 --> 00:53:19,001
You guys do that?

1097
00:53:19,003 --> 00:53:20,970
Oh, yeah, that's
a fairy staple.

1098
00:53:20,972 --> 00:53:23,539
Kill two
birds with one stone.

1099
00:53:23,541 --> 00:53:24,740
What was that?

1100
00:53:24,742 --> 00:53:28,577
I said kill two
birds with one stone.

1101
00:53:28,579 --> 00:53:32,649
Are the birds like a
sacrifice or something?

1102
00:53:32,651 --> 00:53:33,816
Oh, I don't wanna do that.

1103
00:53:33,818 --> 00:53:36,053
- Oh, no.
- I don't wanna do that.

1104
00:53:36,055 --> 00:53:38,387
You set
your mom up with Dylan.

1105
00:53:38,389 --> 00:53:40,724
She wins because
he's a great guy,

1106
00:53:40,726 --> 00:53:43,396
and you win because Turk's gone.

1107
00:53:44,796 --> 00:53:45,630
Two birds.

1108
00:53:46,764 --> 00:53:47,798
Genius.

1109
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,099
Come here!

1110
00:53:50,702 --> 00:53:52,705
No, no, no, thank you.

1111
00:53:53,539 --> 00:53:54,504
You like us!

1112
00:53:54,506 --> 00:53:56,106
Admit that you like us!

1113
00:53:56,108 --> 00:53:57,039
I'm not one of you.

1114
00:53:57,041 --> 00:53:59,341
I'm just here for note-taking.

1115
00:53:59,343 --> 00:54:03,379
Tell us you like us.

1116
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:08,919
Okay, so how do we
make my mom like Dylan?

1117
00:54:11,622 --> 00:54:15,461
Makeover!

1118
00:54:22,501 --> 00:54:23,767
You brought the
fairy dust, right?

1119
00:54:23,769 --> 00:54:25,301
Yeah, I nicked it from Aleeda.

1120
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:27,070
She only keeps it
for emergencies.

1121
00:54:27,072 --> 00:54:28,738
Do you want me to tell on you?

1122
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:30,173
'Cause that sounds like
the kind of thing you say

1123
00:54:30,175 --> 00:54:32,209
when you want me to tell on you.

1124
00:54:32,211 --> 00:54:33,742
She'll never even know.

1125
00:54:33,744 --> 00:54:36,213
Okay, I'll go hit him with
a blast and put him out.

1126
00:54:36,215 --> 00:54:37,580
So what's in it?

1127
00:54:37,582 --> 00:54:38,948
No idea.

1128
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:39,883
You don't know what's in it

1129
00:54:39,885 --> 00:54:41,984
and you wanna blast him with it?

1130
00:54:41,986 --> 00:54:43,555
How much do we use?

1131
00:54:46,691 --> 00:54:48,527
Let's try a handful.

1132
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:56,298
Yay, I
solved a problem!

1133
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:57,934
You so smart!

1134
00:55:01,939 --> 00:55:03,907
Okay, first things first.

1135
00:55:03,909 --> 00:55:05,608

1166
00:56:30,361 --> 00:56:32,695
He's waking up.

1167
00:56:54,686 --> 00:56:55,655
We did it!

1168
00:57:02,693 --> 00:57:05,829
Oh,
someone cleans up good.

1169
00:57:05,831 --> 00:57:07,062
What?

1170
00:57:07,064 --> 00:57:10,733
Oh, oh, yeah,
I guess I was sweeping.

1171
00:57:10,735 --> 00:57:12,137
No, I mean you.

1172
00:57:13,438 --> 00:57:14,273
What?

1173
00:57:21,512 --> 00:57:23,348
Yeah, you look good.

1174
00:57:38,195 --> 00:57:41,564
Bye, Mom, I'm
going to see Tanner.

1175
00:57:41,566 --> 00:57:42,802
Amanda, wait.

1176
00:57:59,251 --> 00:58:02,352
Gam, who exactly is this for?

1177
00:58:02,354 --> 00:58:04,357
Oh, whoever it'll fit.

1178
00:58:06,224 --> 00:58:08,258
Did I ever tell you
when I was asked

1179
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:11,628
to knit a sweater
for the president?

1180
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:12,898
He wanted pink.

1181
00:58:14,666 --> 00:58:17,200
Lots of secrets, that man.

1182
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:18,401
All right, you ready?
This is pretty amazing.

1183
00:58:18,403 --> 00:58:20,303
- Okay.
- Okay, so...

1184
00:58:23,275 --> 00:58:25,108
Yeah.

1185
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:25,975
Uh.

1186
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:28,644
It's not as easy as it looks.

1187
00:58:28,646 --> 00:58:30,379
Yes, it
is, children do it.

1188
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:31,513
Well, all right,
it's sounds like

1189
00:58:31,515 --> 00:58:32,682
you're accepting the challenge.

1190
00:58:32,684 --> 00:58:33,519
Okay.

1191
00:58:37,456 --> 00:58:38,754
How did you?

1192
00:58:38,756 --> 00:58:42,291
And that's how I
got the pickle out.

1193
00:58:42,293 --> 00:58:45,397
Wait, was I telling
the pickle story?

1194
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:50,666
All right.

1195
00:58:50,668 --> 00:58:52,401
Well, it looks like
I gotta go practice.

1196
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:55,106
Yeah.

1197
00:59:00,811 --> 00:59:04,082
You know, I like
it when you do that.

1198
00:59:05,015 --> 00:59:07,216
Do what, the coin trick?

1199
00:59:07,218 --> 00:59:08,053
Smile.

1200
00:59:12,323 --> 00:59:14,457
Is
that for a giraffe?

1201
00:59:14,459 --> 00:59:16,760
What a wonderful idea.

1202
00:59:16,762 --> 00:59:18,530
Scarves for giraffes.

1203
00:59:20,499 --> 00:59:21,965
So it looks like you and Dylan

1204
00:59:21,967 --> 00:59:23,666
have been getting along
pretty good lately.

1205
00:59:23,668 --> 00:59:25,100
Yeah.

1206
00:59:25,102 --> 00:59:27,236
He's a big help around here.

1207
00:59:27,238 --> 00:59:28,204
Is that it?

1208
00:59:28,206 --> 00:59:29,372
Just a good employee?

1209
00:59:29,374 --> 00:59:30,740
Oh, I see where
you're going with this.

1210
00:59:30,742 --> 00:59:33,209
What, where
am I going with it?

1211
00:59:33,211 --> 00:59:35,010
Yeah, I'd like to know.

1212
00:59:35,012 --> 00:59:36,412
Oh, hey.

1213
00:59:36,414 --> 00:59:37,914
What are you doing here?

1214
00:59:37,916 --> 00:59:39,883
Well, I was coming to see if
you wanted to watch a movie,

1215
00:59:39,885 --> 00:59:41,917
but it looks like your
dance card's already full.

1216
00:59:41,919 --> 00:59:43,186
What does that mean?

1217
00:59:43,188 --> 00:59:45,287
Well, it means lately
you've been pretty busy.

1218
00:59:45,289 --> 00:59:46,588
Well, if you haven't noticed,

1219
00:59:46,590 --> 00:59:48,258
we're trying to open a
bed and breakfast, Turk.

1220
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:49,792
I don't know what
you're talking about...

1221
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:51,494
Right,
you have no idea.

1222
00:59:51,496 --> 00:59:53,562
It's just all in my head, right?

1223
00:59:53,564 --> 00:59:55,097
Maybe it's not.

1224
00:59:55,099 --> 00:59:56,298
You know what, Amanda, you
stay out of this, all right?

1225
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:58,136
Okay, that's enough.

1226
00:59:59,503 --> 01:00:01,271
Everything all
right over here?

1227
01:00:01,273 --> 01:00:02,204
Yeah, we're fine.

1228
01:00:02,206 --> 01:00:03,173
Thanks, Dylan.

1229
01:00:03,175 --> 01:00:04,441
Yeah, thanks, Dylan.

1230
01:00:04,443 --> 01:00:05,642
Thanks for getting in the way.

1231
01:00:05,644 --> 01:00:06,742
Pardon me?

1232
01:00:06,744 --> 01:00:07,644
Okay, you know what, Turk?

1233
01:00:07,646 --> 01:00:09,245
I think you better go.

1234
01:00:09,247 --> 01:00:10,180
What, are you serious?

1235
01:00:10,182 --> 01:00:12,448
Yes, I am, actually.

1236
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:16,354
I think we could use a
little bit of time here.

1237
01:00:17,789 --> 01:00:18,791
All right.

1238
01:00:23,662 --> 01:00:25,061
You all right?

1239
01:00:25,063 --> 01:00:28,564
Yeah, I'm sorry
about all of this.

1240
01:00:28,566 --> 01:00:30,133
Well, you should be.

1241
01:00:30,135 --> 01:00:31,434
I figured out how to
make that coin disappear,

1242
01:00:31,436 --> 01:00:34,070
but I can't make it
come back.

1243
01:00:34,072 --> 01:00:34,907
Whoa.

1244
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:37,807
What?

1245
01:00:37,809 --> 01:00:41,977
That is amazing.

1246
01:00:41,979 --> 01:00:42,782
Mm.

1247
01:00:43,747 --> 01:00:45,013
Show me that again, it's...

1248
01:00:45,015 --> 01:00:47,519
- Okay.
- Okay, so you went over.

1249
01:00:55,293 --> 01:00:57,392
It's not polite to
slam doors, Mr. Peterson.

1250
01:00:57,394 --> 01:00:59,695
Oh, Mr. Green.

1251
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:03,733
Uh, wow, you are, you're
really good at sneaking.

1252
01:01:03,735 --> 01:01:05,137
Is it my fault?

1253
01:01:06,171 --> 01:01:07,970
For sneaking?

1254
01:01:07,972 --> 01:01:10,874
Did I not enunciate
the words enough for you

1255
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:13,542
about getting my money?

1256
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:15,010
Uh, no, no, it's not that.

1257
01:01:15,012 --> 01:01:16,512
You're really good at
speaking, actually.

1258
01:01:16,514 --> 01:01:18,814
Um, I didn't realize we
locked an actual date.

1259
01:01:18,816 --> 01:01:20,249
I thought it was
more like, you know,

1260
01:01:20,251 --> 01:01:23,151
when someone says something
like soon or whenever,

1261
01:01:23,153 --> 01:01:25,088
if it works to get it
back to you as soon...

1262
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:27,122
- Stop talking.
- Yes, sir.

1263
01:01:27,124 --> 01:01:30,059
My associates
and I feel it's time

1264
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:31,727
for us to step in.

1265
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:34,162
No, no, really,
please, I'm really close.

1266
01:01:34,164 --> 01:01:35,097
I can do this if you just...

1267
01:01:35,099 --> 01:01:37,300
Manners, Mr. Peterson.

1268
01:01:37,302 --> 01:01:38,568
I'm really sorry.

1269
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:40,970
If you just, I can get
this deal done tonight.

1270
01:01:40,972 --> 01:01:42,872
Oh, actually, no,
no, I can't get it.

1271
01:01:42,874 --> 01:01:45,173
If you give me five more
days I can get it done.

1272
01:01:45,175 --> 01:01:46,845
Just five more days.

1273
01:01:49,613 --> 01:01:50,448
Okay?

1274
01:02:01,825 --> 01:02:03,792
And then my mom
told him to go.

1275
01:02:03,794 --> 01:02:05,327
It really worked!

1276
01:02:05,329 --> 01:02:07,262
McKenna,
you're a genius.

1277
01:02:07,264 --> 01:02:11,800
As far as records go,
I didn't do anything.

1278
01:02:11,802 --> 01:02:15,905
But off the record, I'm
happy for you, Amanda.

1279
01:02:15,907 --> 01:02:16,838
Thank you.

1280
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,341
This is so great.

1281
01:02:18,343 --> 01:02:23,046
Turk is gone and now we
can hang out all the time.

1282
01:02:27,385 --> 01:02:28,984
Where is everyone?

1283
01:02:28,986 --> 01:02:29,986
They're gathering supplies.

1284
01:02:29,988 --> 01:02:32,287
They won't be back for hours.

1285
01:02:32,289 --> 01:02:33,525
So, what now?

1286
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:38,461
Celebrate!

1287
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:40,162
Whew, yeah!

1288
01:02:47,271 --> 01:02:48,106
Whew!

1289
01:02:49,573 --> 01:02:51,374
What is this?

1290
01:02:51,376 --> 01:02:52,211
Aleeda.

1291
01:02:53,445 --> 01:02:56,379
We were, um, just
showing Amanda here...

1292
01:02:56,381 --> 01:02:58,280
Uh, we were celebrating,

1293
01:02:58,282 --> 01:03:00,515
because we helped get
rid of the bad guy.

1294
01:03:00,517 --> 01:03:01,550
What?

1295
01:03:01,552 --> 01:03:02,852
I thought I was quite clear

1296
01:03:02,854 --> 01:03:05,320
when I said that we were
not getting involved.

1297
01:03:05,322 --> 01:03:08,091
They were just trying to help.

1298
01:03:08,093 --> 01:03:09,925
We don't help humans.

1299
01:03:09,927 --> 01:03:12,461
Fairies stay in the forest.

1300
01:03:12,463 --> 01:03:14,497
Aleeda, I can explain.

1301
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:18,100
You disappoint me
most of all, McKenna.

1302
01:03:18,102 --> 01:03:19,102
Say goodbye to Amanda.

1303
01:03:19,104 --> 01:03:21,403
You won't be seeing her anymore.

1304
01:03:21,405 --> 01:03:22,372
What?

1305
01:03:22,374 --> 01:03:23,805
What?

1306
01:03:23,807 --> 01:03:25,073
Bye, Amanda.

1307
01:03:25,075 --> 01:03:26,008
Amanda?

1308
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:28,443
Wait, is that really her name?

1309
01:03:28,445 --> 01:03:30,012
I've been calling her Alanna.

1310
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:31,180
Why did no one tell me?

1311
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:33,483
Bye, guys.

1312
01:03:43,327 --> 01:03:44,593
Sorry.

1313
01:03:44,595 --> 01:03:45,496
For what?

1314
01:03:46,664 --> 01:03:47,999
Being my friend?

1315
01:03:49,066 --> 01:03:50,969
I'm not sorry for that.

1316
01:03:53,671 --> 01:03:56,007
So I guess this is it, huh?

1317
01:03:57,809 --> 01:03:58,644
Hold on.

1318
01:04:01,979 --> 01:04:03,314
Here, take this.

1319
01:04:10,655 --> 01:04:11,954
We can use it to talk.

1320
01:04:11,956 --> 01:04:13,122
You light it up from your window

1321
01:04:13,124 --> 01:04:14,590
and I'll make my wings glow

1322
01:04:14,592 --> 01:04:17,026
so we know that we're
thinking about each other.

1323
01:04:17,028 --> 01:04:19,062
Cali.

1324
01:04:19,064 --> 01:04:20,530
I better go.

1325
01:04:20,532 --> 01:04:23,466
Hit me up at your window
later so I know you're okay.

1326
01:04:23,468 --> 01:04:24,303
Okay.

1327
01:04:39,117 --> 01:04:43,019
I thought you were a giant
firefly coming to take me away.

1328
01:04:43,021 --> 01:04:43,956
Hey, Gam.

1329
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:47,823
Everything okay, petal?

1330
01:04:47,825 --> 01:04:49,992
I got my friends in trouble.

1331
01:04:49,994 --> 01:04:53,262
Oh, well, I'm sure
it'll be all right.

1332
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:55,263
In the long run, the friends
who get you into trouble

1333
01:04:55,265 --> 01:04:57,436
are usually the best ones.

1334
01:04:58,503 --> 01:05:00,236
Did Pops get you in trouble?

1335
01:05:00,238 --> 01:05:03,909
Oh, did he ever.

1336
01:05:07,244 --> 01:05:08,313
I miss him.

1337
01:05:18,222 --> 01:05:22,393
You can't really miss
them if they're still here.

1338
01:05:23,561 --> 01:05:26,495
I see your Pop at
the breakfast table,

1339
01:05:26,497 --> 01:05:29,365
singing his off-key songs.

1340
01:05:29,367 --> 01:05:32,834
I smell him every time
I open the shirt closet.

1341
01:05:32,836 --> 01:05:35,338
And look, right over there.

1342
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:37,774
Pop made it sure that you and he

1343
01:05:37,776 --> 01:05:40,212
could still go on your rides.

1344
01:05:42,514 --> 01:05:44,015
I love you, Gam.

1345
01:05:45,249 --> 01:05:48,253
From your first
breath to my last.

1346
01:06:21,952 --> 01:06:23,852
Gammy, I made you breakfast.

1347
01:06:23,854 --> 01:06:27,622
The toast is kind of burnt,
but at least the eggs are,

1348
01:06:27,624 --> 01:06:30,559
never mind, they're burnt...

1349
01:06:34,865 --> 01:06:35,700
Gammy?

1350
01:07:15,939 --> 01:07:19,610
Can I come in?

1351
01:07:23,481 --> 01:07:25,247
You all right?

1352
01:07:25,249 --> 01:07:26,083
No.

1353
01:07:28,887 --> 01:07:31,354
It's been a couple
of days, Amanda.

1354
01:07:31,356 --> 01:07:35,091
Are you gonna spend the
whole summer up in your room?

1355
01:07:35,093 --> 01:07:35,928
Maybe.

1356
01:07:40,965 --> 01:07:43,702
She really loved
you, you know.

1357
01:07:47,037 --> 01:07:48,706
She loved you too.

1358
01:07:50,842 --> 01:07:51,677
I know.

1359
01:07:57,916 --> 01:08:02,084
What do you say we go
down to the kitchen

1360
01:08:02,086 --> 01:08:04,820
and have a nice cup of tea?

1361
01:08:04,822 --> 01:08:08,327
And I'll fill it with
sugar just like Gam.

1362
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:10,095
I guess.

1363
01:08:11,662 --> 01:08:12,496
Good.

1364
01:08:14,765 --> 01:08:15,601
Come on.

1365
01:08:35,719 --> 01:08:37,386
What is this?

1366
01:08:37,388 --> 01:08:38,921
I think you need to sit down.

1367
01:08:38,923 --> 01:08:41,693
Excuse me, I
have things to do.

1368
01:08:43,361 --> 01:08:44,293
Can you sit down?

1369
01:08:44,295 --> 01:08:45,261
I don't wanna sit down.

1370
01:08:45,263 --> 01:08:46,729
What is he doing here?

1371
01:08:46,731 --> 01:08:48,230
Sorry to hear about
your grandma passing away.

1372
01:08:48,232 --> 01:08:49,731
She was a real great woman.

1373
01:08:49,733 --> 01:08:52,601
Yeah, I don't need you to
tell me how great she was.

1374
01:08:52,603 --> 01:08:54,602
Amanda, I think
you need to sit down.

1375
01:08:54,604 --> 01:08:55,637
Stop asking!

1376
01:08:55,639 --> 01:08:57,373
I'm not sitting down.

1377
01:08:57,375 --> 01:09:00,775
It's best to do
it quick, like a Band-Aid.

1378
01:09:00,777 --> 01:09:01,877
What is this?

1379
01:09:01,879 --> 01:09:04,613
You're going home, kiddo.

1380
01:09:04,615 --> 01:09:06,114
Mom, you can't.

1381
01:09:06,116 --> 01:09:09,185
This is a lot
for you to take right now.

1382
01:09:09,187 --> 01:09:10,685
It's really for
the best, Amanda.

1383
01:09:10,687 --> 01:09:12,421
Turk, you're not helping.

1384
01:09:12,423 --> 01:09:16,124
Let me guess, you
sold the farm too.

1385
01:09:17,128 --> 01:09:18,796
What? I was kidding!

1386
01:09:19,664 --> 01:09:21,896
Mom, what about Tanner?

1387
01:09:21,898 --> 01:09:24,934
I know, but we can get
him a place close to home.

1388
01:09:24,936 --> 01:09:26,601
This is home.

1389
01:09:26,603 --> 01:09:27,602
It's all good, Amanda.

1390
01:09:27,604 --> 01:09:29,070
Your mom sold me the farm.

1391
01:09:29,072 --> 01:09:30,306
Aren't you happy?

1392
01:09:30,308 --> 01:09:31,306
You get to go back to the city

1393
01:09:31,308 --> 01:09:32,541
and see all your friends again.

1394
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,809
I don't have any friends.

1395
01:09:33,811 --> 01:09:35,410
All my friends are here.

1396
01:09:35,412 --> 01:09:36,912
How could you sell this place?

1397
01:09:36,914 --> 01:09:39,181
But it was different when
it was the three of us,

1398
01:09:39,183 --> 01:09:40,016
but now...

1399
01:09:40,018 --> 01:09:40,949
Now what?

1400
01:09:40,951 --> 01:09:42,118
Say it.

1401
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:43,284
Amanda.

1402
01:09:43,286 --> 01:09:45,221
Say Gammy's
dead, so it's okay.

1403
01:09:45,223 --> 01:09:48,056
Say Pops is dead, so it's okay.

1404
01:09:48,058 --> 01:09:49,057
I don't wanna fight.

1405
01:09:49,059 --> 01:09:51,729
Say you hate me, so it's okay.

1406
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:56,731
Wow.

1407
01:09:56,733 --> 01:09:57,969
Teenagers, huh?

1408
01:10:33,603 --> 01:10:35,941
Doesn't even look like me.

1409
01:10:55,625 --> 01:10:56,460
She knew.

1410
01:11:08,371 --> 01:11:10,705
Day one, the
others said it would be

1411
01:11:10,707 --> 01:11:12,373
too much trouble to
bring the fairies,

1412
01:11:12,375 --> 01:11:14,310
and they'd have to stay behind.

1413
01:11:14,312 --> 01:11:16,244
But Aleeda said, "Good
friends don't let

1414
01:11:16,246 --> 01:11:18,650
"a little trouble stop them."

1415
01:11:20,084 --> 01:11:24,686
Day 40, we've been at the
farm for a couple of months.

1416
01:11:24,688 --> 01:11:28,190
There's this boy who
keeps bugging me.

1417
01:11:28,192 --> 01:11:30,525
Aleeda said it's
because he likes me.

1418
01:11:30,527 --> 01:11:32,861
I just think he stinks.

1419
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:33,697
Pops.

1420
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:38,033
Day 100.

1421
01:11:38,035 --> 01:11:41,372
Okay, so, maybe he
doesn't always stink.

1422
01:11:43,006 --> 01:11:45,574
He brought me some
flowers today.

1423
01:11:45,576 --> 01:11:47,642
I think Aleeda helped
him pick them out,

1424
01:11:47,644 --> 01:11:50,445
because yesterday she kept
asking me what kinds I liked,

1425
01:11:50,447 --> 01:11:54,483
and today this kid magically
shows up with the exact ones.

1426
01:11:54,485 --> 01:11:56,521
Either way, it was sweet.

1427
01:11:58,022 --> 01:11:58,857
Last day.

1428
01:12:00,290 --> 01:12:04,959
So I guess this book ends with
me marrying the stinky kid.

1429
01:12:04,961 --> 01:12:08,530
Turns out he's the most
amazing man I've ever met.

1430
01:12:08,532 --> 01:12:11,667
Oh, I have never been so happy.

1431
01:12:11,669 --> 01:12:15,236
And I owe it all to
my dear friend Aleeda

1432
01:12:15,238 --> 01:12:18,076
for asking me what
flowers I like.

1433
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:22,077
Funny, I haven't
seen her in awhile.

1434
01:12:22,079 --> 01:12:24,180
Perhaps she moved away.

1435
01:12:24,182 --> 01:12:27,251
I hope she knows
how much I love her.

1436
01:12:29,053 --> 01:12:30,455
Thank you, Gam.

1437
01:12:36,494 --> 01:12:40,162
Mom, Mom, I have to
show you something!

1438
01:12:40,164 --> 01:12:41,430
Hey, slow down.

1439
01:12:41,432 --> 01:12:42,330
Get out of my way, I
have to show my mom...

1440
01:12:42,332 --> 01:12:43,599
- What's this?
- Stop!

1441
01:12:43,601 --> 01:12:45,266
Relax, I'm
just looking at it.

1442
01:12:45,268 --> 01:12:46,368
I know what you're doing.

1443
01:12:46,370 --> 01:12:47,669
Yeah, what's that?

1444
01:12:47,671 --> 01:12:49,637
You used my mom
to get this place.

1445
01:12:49,639 --> 01:12:52,373
And when you said demo,
you meant tear it down.

1446
01:12:52,375 --> 01:12:53,842
But once I show her this book,

1447
01:12:53,844 --> 01:12:55,110
she's not gonna sell it to you.

1448
01:12:55,112 --> 01:12:56,811
Hmm, you have it
all figured out.

1449
01:12:56,813 --> 01:12:57,980
Did your mom tell you

1450
01:12:57,982 --> 01:13:00,815
that she's already
signed the papers over?

1451
01:13:00,817 --> 01:13:01,950
- Let it go!
- Hey, hey!

1452
01:13:01,952 --> 01:13:02,985
Hey, relax, all right.

1453
01:13:02,987 --> 01:13:04,153
Just take it easy.

1454
01:13:04,155 --> 01:13:05,654
- You're gonna get...
- What's going on here?

1455
01:13:05,656 --> 01:13:07,855
Amanda was
just showing me her scrapbook.

1456
01:13:07,857 --> 01:13:09,225
She's actually got
some wonderful drawings

1457
01:13:09,227 --> 01:13:10,092
- and pictures in here.
- He's lying!

1458
01:13:10,094 --> 01:13:11,593
This is Gam's book,

1459
01:13:11,595 --> 01:13:13,294
and it proves that there
are fairies in the forest.

1460
01:13:13,296 --> 01:13:14,562
What is going on here?

1461
01:13:14,564 --> 01:13:15,898
Look, I found Gam's book,

1462
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:17,166
and Turk doesn't
want you to see it

1463
01:13:17,168 --> 01:13:18,934
because there are fairies in it.

1464
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:23,338
Look, there are photos of Gam
and Pop when they were little.

1465
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:26,742
I think it's safe to say
Amanda's seeing things.

1466
01:13:26,744 --> 01:13:28,377
Just look.

1467
01:13:28,379 --> 01:13:29,645
Look, right there!

1468
01:13:29,647 --> 01:13:32,146
Enough about the fairies!

1469
01:13:32,148 --> 01:13:34,350
These are just drawings, Amanda.

1470
01:13:34,352 --> 01:13:36,517
They're not real
fairies, just drawings.

1471
01:13:36,519 --> 01:13:38,753
You just have to believe.

1472
01:13:38,755 --> 01:13:40,623
They don't exist!

1473
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:43,124
Look, I'm getting
worried about you.

1474
01:13:43,126 --> 01:13:45,327
You're way too old to
be imagining fairies.

1475
01:13:45,329 --> 01:13:47,229
I am not imagining them.

1476
01:14:01,745 --> 01:14:02,910
What are you doing?

1477
01:14:02,912 --> 01:14:04,145
Get away from my horse!

1478
01:14:04,147 --> 01:14:05,381
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, relax.

1479
01:14:05,383 --> 01:14:07,115
We're doing our job, okay?

1480
01:14:07,117 --> 01:14:07,949
What is this?

1481
01:14:07,951 --> 01:14:08,917
Turk, what's going on?

1482
01:14:08,919 --> 01:14:10,653
I have no idea.

1483
01:14:10,655 --> 01:14:12,887
I'd be happy to
shed some light.

1484
01:14:12,889 --> 01:14:15,423
Uh, Mr. Green, I wasn't
expecting you so soon.

1485
01:14:15,425 --> 01:14:18,293
Oh, I think we've
waited quite long enough.

1486
01:14:18,295 --> 01:14:19,794
Turk?

1487
01:14:19,796 --> 01:14:21,262
Uh, now,
you see, in the long run,

1488
01:14:21,264 --> 01:14:22,698
this is actually gonna
be a funny story.

1489
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:24,099
You're gonna laugh.

1490
01:14:24,101 --> 01:14:26,568
But Mr. Green technically
owns the farm now.

1491
01:14:26,570 --> 01:14:30,071
Well, most of it, I
still own 10% of it.

1492
01:14:30,073 --> 01:14:33,775
Actually, my associates
and I no longer feel

1493
01:14:33,777 --> 01:14:36,011
your vision and
ours are aligned.

1494
01:14:36,013 --> 01:14:37,479
What?

1495
01:14:37,481 --> 01:14:38,681
We've decided to part
ways with you, Mr. Peterson.

1496
01:14:38,683 --> 01:14:40,048
Hold on, you can't
just cut me out.

1497
01:14:40,050 --> 01:14:41,417
Oh, we can.

1498
01:14:41,419 --> 01:14:43,153
In fact, we just did.

1499
01:14:44,854 --> 01:14:47,922
You see, the property
is signed over today,

1500
01:14:47,924 --> 01:14:51,360
and you said your part would
be taken care of ages ago.

1501
01:14:51,362 --> 01:14:54,495
Your wooing took far too long.

1502
01:14:54,497 --> 01:14:55,433
Wooing me?

1503
01:14:56,701 --> 01:14:58,400
This was part of your
plan the whole time?

1504
01:14:58,402 --> 01:15:00,034
I can see how it
looks like that,

1505
01:15:00,036 --> 01:15:01,537
but if you give me
a couple of seconds,

1506
01:15:01,539 --> 01:15:02,570
I can show you that this
is financially beneficial

1507
01:15:02,572 --> 01:15:04,172
for the both of, oof!

1508
01:15:04,174 --> 01:15:06,208
Mom, tell
them to let Tanner go!

1509
01:15:07,478 --> 01:15:09,744
Not somewhere you
wanna put your hand!

1510
01:15:09,746 --> 01:15:12,181
Look, whoever you
are, I made a mistake.

1511
01:15:12,183 --> 01:15:13,849
I'm not selling you the farm.

1512
01:15:13,851 --> 01:15:16,251
So you can get your goons
and get off my property.

1513
01:15:16,253 --> 01:15:19,020
Tsk, such bad manners.

1514
01:15:19,022 --> 01:15:21,155
Oh, you're right, I'm sorry.

1515
01:15:21,157 --> 01:15:22,690
My mother taught me better.

1516
01:15:22,692 --> 01:15:26,494
Pretty please, with sugar
on top, get off my property.

1517
01:15:26,496 --> 01:15:27,796
Much better.

1518
01:15:27,798 --> 01:15:31,699
Unfortunately, this deed
says that this property

1519
01:15:31,701 --> 01:15:34,369
and everything on it is mine.

1520
01:15:34,371 --> 01:15:35,870
Tanner?

1521
01:15:35,872 --> 01:15:39,044
So pretty please,
with sugar on top,

1522
01:15:39,943 --> 01:15:42,444
get off my property.

1523
01:15:42,446 --> 01:15:43,578
You can't have him.

1524
01:15:44,714 --> 01:15:46,013
Amanda, come back!

1525
01:15:46,015 --> 01:15:47,451
Amanda!

1526
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:14,842
Cali, Cali, please,
you have to help.

1527
01:16:14,844 --> 01:16:16,078
Amanda, what's wrong?

1528
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:18,212
Some people are here
to destroy my farm.

1529
01:16:18,214 --> 01:16:19,748
What is this?

1530
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:21,382
Aleeda, please,
I'm begging you.

1531
01:16:21,384 --> 01:16:26,154
They wanna destroy the farm and
they wanna take Tanner away.

1532
01:16:26,156 --> 01:16:27,157
I'm sorry.

1533
01:16:29,593 --> 01:16:30,825
We can't interfere.

1534
01:16:32,595 --> 01:16:35,099
She didn't forget about you.

1535
01:16:37,334 --> 01:16:40,002
I know you think she
did, but she didn't.

1536
01:16:40,004 --> 01:16:41,740
She always loved you.

1537
01:16:46,710 --> 01:16:50,048
She just got too old
to see you anymore.

1538
01:16:51,182 --> 01:16:54,219
She would never turn
her back on you.

1539
01:16:59,089 --> 01:17:00,388
You always said good
friends never let

1540
01:17:00,390 --> 01:17:02,423
a little trouble get in the way.

1541
01:17:02,425 --> 01:17:04,329
I guess you were wrong.

1542
01:17:28,251 --> 01:17:29,086
Cali.

1543
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:33,123
We're with you, Alanna.

1544
01:17:34,325 --> 01:17:36,324
It isn't happening,
turn your rig around!

1545
01:17:36,326 --> 01:17:38,025
We're not
going anywhere, pal.

1546
01:17:38,027 --> 01:17:38,860
Hey, just take a breather.

1547
01:17:38,862 --> 01:17:40,328
Keep calm, everybody.

1548
01:17:40,330 --> 01:17:41,529
Come on, I'm sure we can come
to a reasonable solution.

1549
01:17:41,531 --> 01:17:42,698
Just calm down.

1550
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:44,166
Well, we need you here now.

1551
01:17:44,168 --> 01:17:45,335
Get over here.

1552
01:17:53,076 --> 01:17:54,575
Get your kid outta here!

1553
01:17:54,577 --> 01:17:56,744
Listen, if I could
control her, I would.

1554
01:17:58,515 --> 01:17:59,349
Whew!

1555
01:18:05,488 --> 01:18:06,587
Ow.

1556
01:18:06,589 --> 01:18:07,922
Yeah!

1557
01:18:07,924 --> 01:18:08,759
Ha ha!

1558
01:18:10,326 --> 01:18:11,226
Ooh.

1559
01:18:13,464 --> 01:18:14,466
I am done!

1560
01:18:19,068 --> 01:18:22,404
I tried to play nicely
and do this legally,

1561
01:18:22,406 --> 01:18:25,810
but you are insistent
on forcing my hand.

1562
01:18:26,977 --> 01:18:30,212
So now we'll do
this another way.

1563
01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:48,465
Stop!

1564
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:51,835
Ah!

1565
01:18:57,540 --> 01:18:58,375
Fairies!

1566
01:18:59,509 --> 01:19:00,475
Fly!

1567
01:19:00,477 --> 01:19:03,747
Fairies!

1568
01:19:07,317 --> 01:19:08,151
Whew!

1569
01:19:09,652 --> 01:19:12,823
Yay, Aleeda.

1570
01:19:21,999 --> 01:19:23,164
Ah.

1571
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:32,440
Get back here!

1572
01:19:33,643 --> 01:19:35,343
I don't know what games
you're playing here,

1573
01:19:35,345 --> 01:19:38,879
but I assure you,
this is the end!

1574
01:19:38,881 --> 01:19:40,617
Yes, I think it is.

1575
01:19:46,589 --> 01:19:49,391
Who wants to tell me what
the blazes is going on here?

1576
01:19:49,393 --> 01:19:51,560
This guy was trying
to burn down the stable.

1577
01:19:51,562 --> 01:19:52,793
Is that so?

1578
01:19:52,795 --> 01:19:54,730
Sheriff, I think
you'll see here

1579
01:19:54,732 --> 01:19:57,666
that I am the legal
owner of this property,

1580
01:19:57,668 --> 01:20:02,671
and as such, I have the right
to do with as I see fit.

1581
01:20:02,673 --> 01:20:04,439
I guess technically
this is right.

1582
01:20:04,441 --> 01:20:06,374
But, Charlie, there
are other circumstances.

1583
01:20:06,376 --> 01:20:08,342
No, I'm sorry, darlin',

1584
01:20:08,344 --> 01:20:10,779
but if he owned this property,
he'd be within his rights.

1585
01:20:10,781 --> 01:20:11,946
- Thank you.
- That is,

1586
01:20:11,948 --> 01:20:14,115
if he owned the property.

1587
01:20:14,117 --> 01:20:15,417
What?

1588
01:20:15,419 --> 01:20:17,452
- I just showed you the deed.
- I know.

1589
01:20:17,454 --> 01:20:19,520
These papers say that you do.

1590
01:20:19,522 --> 01:20:21,155
But the problem is I'm the one

1591
01:20:21,157 --> 01:20:24,825
that did up the deed for
this place, and it was split.

1592
01:20:24,827 --> 01:20:27,231
Yes, then the old bag died!

1593
01:20:29,198 --> 01:20:30,865
It went to the mum!

1594
01:20:30,867 --> 01:20:33,370
She signed, ya backwoods hick!

1595
01:20:35,138 --> 01:20:37,004
Fair enough.

1596
01:20:37,006 --> 01:20:40,976
Only thing is my good friend
Jean had me draw up a new will,

1597
01:20:40,978 --> 01:20:44,645
singing her half
over to someone else.

1598
01:20:46,517 --> 01:20:47,983
Me?

1599
01:20:47,985 --> 01:20:50,722
Yes!

1600
01:20:54,991 --> 01:20:56,525
What?

1601
01:20:56,527 --> 01:20:59,997
So you got half the deed
signed, but you need both.

1602
01:21:01,432 --> 01:21:03,565
Miss Amanda, you looking
to sell your half?

1603
01:21:03,567 --> 01:21:04,435
Never.

1604
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:07,034
Then it looks like
this contract is

1605
01:21:07,036 --> 01:21:10,874
what we backwoods hicks
would call null and void.

1606
01:21:14,277 --> 01:21:15,342
- Turk!
- Yep.

1607
01:21:15,344 --> 01:21:17,445
Get my car.

1608
01:21:17,447 --> 01:21:20,315
I'm leaving this
mannerless hole.

1609
01:21:20,317 --> 01:21:23,051
I'm afraid that's
not gonna be possible.

1610
01:21:23,053 --> 01:21:24,919
You tried to burn this down.

1611
01:21:24,921 --> 01:21:27,221
That is attempted arson.

1612
01:21:27,223 --> 01:21:28,256
Ow!

1613
01:21:28,258 --> 01:21:29,725
They're too tight!

1614
01:21:29,727 --> 01:21:32,993
That's for calling my
very good friend an old bag.

1615
01:21:32,995 --> 01:21:35,062
Manners, Mr. Green.

1616
01:21:35,898 --> 01:21:39,200
Ow!

1617
01:21:43,206 --> 01:21:44,940
Won't you come down
to the station too,

1618
01:21:44,942 --> 01:21:46,475
little Turkey Pete?

1619
01:21:46,477 --> 01:21:47,743
Oh, I'm not very
involved in this, I should...

1620
01:21:47,745 --> 01:21:49,343
Oh, I'm
sure there's some kind

1621
01:21:49,345 --> 01:21:51,178
of fraud charge
I can make stick.

1622
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:52,012
Come on.

1623
01:22:05,295 --> 01:22:06,794
Thank you so much, guys.

1624
01:22:06,796 --> 01:22:08,029
You saved Tanner.

1625
01:22:08,031 --> 01:22:09,864
What are friends for?

1626
01:22:13,202 --> 01:22:14,037
Amanda.

1627
01:22:14,937 --> 01:22:17,107
Look at the shooting star.

1628
01:22:19,942 --> 01:22:21,309
Are you coming?

1629
01:22:22,345 --> 01:22:23,544
What is it?

1630
01:22:23,546 --> 01:22:24,715
A new fairy.

1631
01:22:29,353 --> 01:22:30,618
Come one.

1632
01:22:30,620 --> 01:22:31,852
Amanda,
where are you going?

1633
01:22:31,854 --> 01:22:32,988
Why don't we just
stop fighting her

1634
01:22:32,990 --> 01:22:35,590
and see where she's going?

1635
01:22:35,592 --> 01:22:36,591
Okay.

1636
01:23:03,954 --> 01:23:04,985
Just trust me.

1637
01:23:04,987 --> 01:23:06,223
You'll love it.

1638
01:23:12,963 --> 01:23:14,229
A shooting star means

1639
01:23:14,231 --> 01:23:16,664
that a new fairy will
be joining our family.

1640
01:23:16,666 --> 01:23:19,836
Let's all welcome
them with open arms.

1641
01:23:21,737 --> 01:23:25,407
Guys, I know this is hard
for you, but just believe.

1642
01:23:25,409 --> 01:23:26,244
Just try.

1643
01:23:28,144 --> 01:23:29,647
I'll try, but...

1644
01:23:35,919 --> 01:23:36,754
Whoa.

1645
01:23:37,687 --> 01:23:38,619
What?

1646
01:23:38,621 --> 01:23:39,523
What is it?

1647
01:23:46,863 --> 01:23:48,562
I see it.

1648
01:23:48,564 --> 01:23:49,400
I see it.

1649
01:23:53,303 --> 01:23:54,539
They're here.

1650
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:32,008
Let's party!

1651
01:24:38,415 --> 01:24:39,247
Yay!

1652
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:53,360
I can't believe it took
me so long to see this.

1653
01:24:53,362 --> 01:24:54,464
It's amazing.

1654
01:24:59,369 --> 01:25:00,705
They're ready.

1655
01:25:07,009 --> 01:25:07,909
Who's ready?

1656
01:25:07,911 --> 01:25:09,343
I don't know.

1657
01:25:09,345 --> 01:25:11,445
I don't know, this fairy's
never come out before.

1658
01:25:11,447 --> 01:25:15,283
They said they only come
out when they're ready.

1659
01:25:29,265 --> 01:25:30,101
Pops.

1660
01:26:39,536 --> 01:26:42,037
May I have this dance?

1661
01:26:42,039 --> 01:26:45,209
Of course.

1662
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:52,946
I love you guys.

1663
01:26:52,948 --> 01:26:55,786
From your first
breath to my last.

1664
01:27:00,693 --> 01:27:05,693
