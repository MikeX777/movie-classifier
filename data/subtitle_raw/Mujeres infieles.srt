1
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:02,774
Thank you very much.

2
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:06,010
So?

3
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,143
It's beautiful!

4
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:09,348
Quieta!

5
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:17,593
Talk to me.

6
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,858
Talk to me like when you read
the weather report.

7
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,763
Come on, come on, please.

8
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,034
Good evening.

9
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:30,271
...Like the synoptic chart shows,
in the...

10
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:36,543
...Antarctic territory...
extreme temperatures are expected...

11
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:38,139
Say the morning fog...

12
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:40,919
The temperature will...
10º Fahrenheit.

13
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,078
Morning fog...

14
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:44,053
The morning fog...

15
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:52,925
Temperatures are
between 3 and 13...

16
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:03,468
In Valdivia the humidity
surprises the southerners...

17
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:10,413
In Temuco, Concepción and Talca...

18
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,413
...changing to clear skies...

19
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,543
Cheers, my love...

20
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:15,780
Cheers...

21
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,694
29 grados...

22
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:28,830
to the north...
it becomes unbearable.

23
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:36,232
In the Elqui Valley...

24
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:38,340
...thanks to the Pisco Sour.

25
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:47,746
...the situation becomes unbearable.

26
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,776
I need a cigarette...

27
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,829
Do you have
the lighter somewhere?

28
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,507
This fucking place stinks...

29
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,948
UNFAITHFUL WOMEN

30
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:07,381
Come on...

31
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:16,395
Four, three, two, one.

32
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,632
62% of the Chilean women,

33
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:22,401
is or has been unfaithful
to their couple.

34
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:26,370
This figure was obtained
thanks to a survey...

35
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,606
performed by the United Nations.

36
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:31,209
This is the topic
that we will address tonight...

37
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:33,808
in Mario Guzman's report.

38
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,388
Good evening, Mario.

39
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,787
Good evening,

40
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,857
we are here with Eva Soler,

41
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:39,890
psychologist,

42
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:41,960
specialist in sexual disorders...

43
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:44,325
who is here to explain
these figures...

44
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,362
Good evening Eva,

45
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,333
thank you for being with us.
Welcome.

46
00:07:47,368 --> 00:07:48,129
Hello, thank you.

47
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:51,397
Tell us, I understand that
around 1600 women...

48
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:52,630
were surveyed in the country.

49
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:57,236
And the results of this survey gives us
an absolute and categorical conclusion.

50
00:07:57,743 --> 00:08:01,839
We are in the first place at a worldwide
level in that topic, is that so?

51
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,506
Yes, and for an extensive margin.

52
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:07,450
We are definitely the world
champions in female infidelity...

53
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:09,180
Men only surpass us.

54
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:13,748
It can be deduced then that
we are the world champions of the cuckolds.

55
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:16,493
This makes us appear ridiculous,
of course.

56
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,161
That is a very masculine
point of view.

57
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:20,493
But you must consider that...

58
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,864
without the active
participation of males...

59
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:25,267
these figures
would not be possible.

60
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:28,169
What do you mean by
the active participation of men?

61
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:29,206
Well, in the first place,

62
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,890
to cheat on a man
I have to do it with another man,

63
00:08:31,925 --> 00:08:34,472
unless I am a lesbian,
which is another possibility,

64
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:36,912
in the second place,
a woman cheats for a reason,

65
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:40,383
women do not cheat
just because they are horny...

66
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:43,944
We have a strong monogamous instinct
unless we are profoundly unhappy.

67
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:46,991
Excuse me... you said
monogamous instinct...

68
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:51,259
That is women can go
against their instinct for revenge?

69
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:54,230
Revenge is one of the motives mentioned
though not the most important.

70
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:58,802
The woman does not feel loved,
in general. She doesn't feel valued,

71
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:02,205
and that inhibits her sexually
with her couple,

72
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:05,505
you see then what a woman
looks for when being unfaithful...

73
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:07,272
is really a boyfriend,

74
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,742
is to regain the sensation
she had with her husband...

75
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:10,749
in the beginning,

76
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,114
when he complimented her,
acknowledged her,

77
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,447
he loved the way he was. So...

78
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,819
it would never be about
a woman would for being fresh,

79
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:21,951
to put it in a way,
would be unfaithful?

80
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:26,861
Yes, well there are women
that are more passionate.

81
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,728
But there are few women

82
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:32,133
that manage to separate
affection from sex.

83
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:36,106
Thus, they tend to
build a relationship

84
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,732
that lasts in time.

85
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,139
We do not have much
time left, Eva,

86
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:45,411
Tell me, what attitude should
men have to revert this figure?

87
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:49,615
In case they care...
do you think men care about it?

88
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,349
I don't think men are
foolish enough

89
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:55,757
...to not realize
that choosing to be distant

90
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:57,658
can bring consequences.

91
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,890
Now, they could
make themselves

92
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:02,126
responsible of the following
mathematical equation:

93
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:06,398
A man in Chile works
an average of 12 hrs a day,

94
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:09,941
we are including transportation,
food, etc.

95
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,010
He watches TV a couple of hours,

96
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,103
sleeps around 6 hours
which is not a lot

97
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:18,183
...and we are not considering
the dentist,

98
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,583
the buddies, the ex wife,
the children... and the mother

99
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:26,454
- two hours, gives us a total of 22 hours.
- Right.

100
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:31,329
2 hours, dedicated to sex...

101
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:34,467
Don't you think it's more
than enough to satisfy

102
00:10:34,502 --> 00:10:38,563
the most passionate
and demanding woman?

103
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:40,194
I want you to make
love to me.

104
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:48,513
Excuse me?

105
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:51,412
Yes there is something
that is not being understood,

106
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:53,485
what an unfaithful woman
looks for

107
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:56,248
is not exactly
sexual satisfaction,

108
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:59,256
it does not go alone,
in the woman's case.

109
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:01,326
Now, even if it
were that way

110
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,987
the monthly average of orgasms

111
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:07,964
of a married woman
in Chile is 1.2 orgasms.

112
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,295
It is worrying.
Amazing.

113
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,837
That demonstrates that
it is not working

114
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,667
- ...with those 2 hours.
- No, absolutely.

115
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,368
Unfortunately we ran
out of time but

116
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:18,465
before we say goodbye

117
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:21,944
I would like to invite you
to our next program.

118
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:23,605
That is all for today,

119
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,206
we thank you
for your being with us

120
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:26,750
and wait for you
tomorrow as usual

121
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,480
at the same time
in our news space.

122
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,080
See you tomorrow, Mario,

123
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,181
thank you very much
for this interesting topic.

124
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,658
More than interesting
I would call it polemical.

125
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:38,559
Cecilia, which group
do you belong to?

126
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:43,727
The 62% or the 38%?
Good night.

127
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:45,669
Good night.

128
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:46,895
Cut!

129
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:49,470
Ready?

130
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:54,470
Ready, yes. Goodbye.
Bye.

131
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,478
Thank you
Thanks to you.

132
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,781
Cecilia, you know him well.

133
00:12:00,816 --> 00:12:02,579
You know he likes
to provoke.

134
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:03,916
Don't take it like something personal.

135
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,422
He's an asshole.
I don't want to see Mario again.

136
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,985
Please calm down
and listen to me.

137
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,618
I cannot fire him just like that.

138
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,288
He has just renewed
his contract with the channel.

139
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,695
What language
do you want me to use?

140
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,494
Take him off my side,
I don't know,

141
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:18,695
send him to the streets,
let him look for UFO's,

142
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:20,066
vampires,
I don't give a shit.

143
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:21,730
He pisses me off,
he makes me nervous,

144
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,035
I can't make the questions.

145
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:25,700
So take him away,
as far as possible. OK?

146
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,438
All right, but please
lower your voice.

147
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:28,811
I'll see what I can do.

148
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,149
Here, your husband
has called you twice.

149
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:34,017
Just what I needed.

150
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:41,626
That... I want you
to make love to me.

151
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,723
But, Virginita,
we are having dinner.

152
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:51,735
Yes, but I want to
make love to you now.

153
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:56,065
Honey, could you wait
till I finish dinner

154
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,836
and we are in a more
appropriate place?

155
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,044
Ok, honey, forget it.

156
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:06,946
Wait a minute, Virginia.

157
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:12,150
Sorry, but what happens
if I'm tired of waiting?

158
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:15,091
Sorry, is this a complaint?

159
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:21,730
You should be happy
with the things you have, Virginia.

160
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:23,732
And enjoy them.

161
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:27,305
And not behave like a
spoilt and pampered girl.

162
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:28,406
Do you understand me?

163
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,776
Ok, honey,

164
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:35,171
from now on you won't hear
any more complaints from me.

165
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:49,285
Hello, Francisco.
What is the matter?

166
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,324
Late, like every Wednesday,
why?

167
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:58,801
Did you use the thermometer?

168
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:03,999
That's not much,
give her half an aspirin.

169
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:10,245
I can't, I have a
production meeting.

170
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,316
I'll have to let you go,
Francisco,

171
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:21,484
the meeting starts in 10 minutes.
And I have not prepared anything.

172
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,558
No, don't wait up.

173
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:28,895
Kiss.

174
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:31,832
Me too, bye.

175
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:35,437
Meeting?

176
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:38,543
Go to hell!

177
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,308
Be careful.
Be very careful, Cecilia.

178
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,146
Out of my way, asshole.

179
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,545
Out of my way!

180
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,428
Mario.

181
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:10,866
What's up, everything alright?

182
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,466
Yes. I'm leaving.

183
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:17,149
Look, be prepared because
I have a little job for you.

184
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,277
Today?

185
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:19,874
Yes, now.
Now?

186
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:22,680
Yes, we have to do this
for the late night news.

187
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:25,985
In a Firemen's Quarters?

188
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:28,189
What's wrong with that?

189
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,762
This is a joke...

190
00:15:29,797 --> 00:15:30,990
Excuse me?

191
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:32,087
Is this a joke?

192
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,895
Of course not.

193
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:36,832
It needs to be done
and we are going to do it.

194
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:41,267
That's it. That's it.

195
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,468
What a kiss ass!

196
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:51,008
What do you mean

197
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,682
I put my ass on the line
to give you

198
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,346
what you deserve
once a week

199
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,514
...and it's not enough.

200
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,819
And I don't...
Yes, you too.

201
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:02,257
But why do we have
to talk about it now?

202
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:03,261
Because.

203
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:05,588
But why now? We
are going to have a good time...

204
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:07,529
Because of Mario Guzman.

205
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,965
Who cares about thatjerk?
What's he got to do with it?

206
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,902
What do you mean who cares
... that asshole knows something.

207
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:15,734
He's going to make this go public.
Would you like a scandal?

208
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:18,435
Don't be paranoid,
nothing's gonna happen.

209
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:20,034
I'm not being paranoid.

210
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:21,906
I think we have to
assume the fact

211
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:23,514
...that this is notjust
being horny.

212
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:27,416
I'm not so sure this is
not being horny

213
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,146
Come on, Alberto, I mean it.

214
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,253
We can't go on like this.

215
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,622
We have to assume
the truth

216
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,560
and say that we are together
and that's it.

217
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,761
OK.

218
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:22,202
Hey, come with me.

219
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,807
You're lovely.

220
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:30,210
Then lets go.

221
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:35,483
Lets leave this place.

222
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:45,227
What are you thinking of?

223
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:49,523
Alvaro.

224
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:55,336
Lets not talk
about him now.

225
00:17:56,275 --> 00:18:03,613
- Hey, I have a present for you.
- Really?

226
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:04,909
- Yes.
- Why?

227
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:13,186
Why? Because
you are the prettiest,

228
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,385
the hottest woman.

229
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:17,286
The best mother...

230
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,404
What is this?

231
00:18:54,166 --> 00:19:00,071
I know it might be
corny,

232
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,702
but it is what I feel for you.

233
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:09,941
Tell me...
then we take it from the top.

234
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:12,243
And then
we come back to the van.

235
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:15,820
Lets go,
it's already late.

236
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,324
Ok, luck to you...

237
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,301
Nice fire engine.
Shall we make some shots here?

238
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:33,530
Yes, it could be... but no...
wait a minute...

239
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:35,864
Check it out,
the engines are brand new -Yep.

240
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:37,236
Modern, eh.

241
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:46,748
Hello, yes, working. Yes,

242
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:51,254
but I left you a message.

243
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:55,082
I can't do anything right now,

244
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:56,353
what do you want me to do,
I'm working.

245
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:59,760
I don't like it either.
I don't like it

246
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:03,631
That's how it is...
she hang up, the bitch.

247
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:08,871
Take it easy.
Idiot, retarded.

248
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:50,909
Three.

249
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,313
We are beating the record...

250
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:01,591
I want to marry you. Cecilia.

251
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:06,530
As if it were that easy...

252
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:10,033
At least we have
a divorce law.

253
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:13,163
We have to do something,

254
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:15,705
they will catch us any moment

255
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:19,436
and shit's going to
hit the fan.

256
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,979
I need a cigarette.

257
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,582
Do you have
the lighter there?

258
00:21:57,617 --> 00:21:59,447
Thrilling news.

259
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:01,985
You come here
looking for thrilling news...

260
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:04,112
I don't know
if I offend you

261
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:06,952
but we are in Santiago,
not in New York.

262
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:08,458
Really, there's not much
happening here.

263
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,893
If you want we can go in
and sit down to continue talking...

264
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,198
A bomb!

265
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,799
It was near.
Near.

266
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:42,824
18 restore, 19 attack.
Lets go! Quick.

267
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:56,201
Lets move, quick!

268
00:22:57,342 --> 00:22:59,276
An explosion destroyed
part of a motel in our capital.

269
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:03,606
One of our mobile units has
just arrived at the scene

270
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:09,653
In a few moments
we will have live images.

271
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:11,383
Well, we would usually
begin with a "good evening"

272
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,151
but there is nothing
good about tonight,

273
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:14,520
Just a few seconds ago

274
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:18,118
a bomb damaged great part
of the motel behind me,

275
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:21,161
located in the most exclusive
neighborhood of our capital

276
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:23,029
...Firemen are...

277
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:32,168
Hey,
we are going to get burnt!

278
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:33,375
Hey.

279
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:36,905
Turn it off, turn it off.
Turn the camera off.

280
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:37,913
Don't fuck me up.

281
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:39,574
I scratch you're back
you'll scratch mine... alright?

282
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:51,856
What are you doing here!
Get out right now!

283
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:53,692
Come in, come in...

284
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,733
I told you we should leave,
Mario.

285
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:56,960
Don't chicken out now,
asshole.

286
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:58,467
We'll save the year
with this report.

287
00:23:58,937 --> 00:23:59,961
I'll make a phone call.

288
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:09,205
Hello, hello, yes,
Mario Guzman here.

289
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:11,220
Tell him that we are
inside the motel now,

290
00:24:11,221 --> 00:24:12,221
tell him we are in the motel

291
00:24:12,222 --> 00:24:13,450
We need to be on air
any minute now.

292
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,920
Surprise.
Announce shocking images,

293
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,389
Tell these assholes that
I'll make the report.

294
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,422
I'll begin it and finish it.

295
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:22,186
I don't want any censoring.
No censoring. OK, bye.

296
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,386
The images that we have captured
are really overwhelming

297
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:27,124
and difficult to reproduce
for you,

298
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:31,066
that is why we have
decided to enter this room,

299
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:31,931
a random room,

300
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:34,940
in order for you to see
what is happening in this place.

301
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:37,843
In order for you to see
what is happening in this place.

302
00:24:37,878 --> 00:24:40,437
We can see that the
structural damages are immense.

303
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:42,137
Glass, an intense gas smell.

304
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:46,183
We want to warn you that
the images we will show

305
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:47,945
...now may be shocking.

306
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:53,150
There is a body
of a person on the carpet,

307
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:56,591
our camera man, Kike Inostrosa,
is trying to identify him,

308
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:59,789
The images are really astonishing,
we are the first ones...

309
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:05,936
Shit hit the fan, man.

310
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:07,863
It's Valdes.

311
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:12,610
It's Alberto Valdes, man.

312
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,313
Lets get out of here.

313
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:21,782
Yes, Yes I hear you, What?

314
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:26,023
We were cut off.
We are off the air.

315
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,320
What are we going to do?

316
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:46,609
Hello. I understand.
I understand, OK, OK.

317
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:48,310
What did they say?

318
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:49,673
Shit hit the fan.

319
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,712
Nobody wants to take
responsibility for this.

320
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:55,242
Lets get out of here, Mario.

321
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:58,078
No, we are not leaving.

322
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:01,518
No man comes to a motel alone.

323
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:14,298
Hello, Ramirez, this is Teresa Vial.

324
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:20,003
Where the hell do I look.

325
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:36,589
Hello... ok, ok.
I get it, perfect.

326
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:38,558
They don't want
any more images of Valdes.

327
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,354
We will be on air
in 10 seconds.

328
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:11,153
Bitch, I knew it, bitch.

329
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:21,771
We continue, live.

330
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:27,108
TV 6 to show you
what is going on this motel,

331
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:31,672
we are in the presence
of a second victim,

332
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,909
we don't know who it is...

333
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:34,917
we want to warn you that

334
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:40,548
what we will show
now may be highly shocking.

335
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,184
We will see who it is...

336
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:11,920
Go to bed, dear.

337
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:14,149
But I can't sleep.

338
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:17,288
Go to bed, I said.

339
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:17,179
Hello... Listen...

340
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:34,729
Anything else?
Sorry? Hello, hello.

341
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:45,312
We are back with this impacting news,
from the place of the scene,

342
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:49,216
our reporters are on site.
Go ahead Mario.

343
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,292
Hi, come on in.

344
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:37,123
Excuse me.

345
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:39,932
What happened?

346
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:41,665
Forgive me for
bothering you now.

347
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:43,638
But I tried to get you
on the phone

348
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:46,539
but it wasn't on.

349
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:49,135
I turned it off because,
you know I was on TV.

350
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:50,737
Yes... Then it started ringing
so often that I turned it of.

351
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:51,611
Yes, I saw you.

352
00:30:51,716 --> 00:30:54,116
You looked great,
congratulations...

353
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:55,652
Weren't we supposed
to meet on Friday?

354
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:58,813
Yes, but I needed
to talk to you now

355
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:00,823
...I couldn't wait until Friday

356
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,962
Come in.
What is the problem.

357
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:07,429
Did you run out
of medication for your anxiety?

358
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:11,468
No, no, that is very much
under control.

359
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,663
So, then...

360
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:19,710
Then, what happens to me
is calledAlejandro.

361
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:24,006
Alejandro, who is he?
Do I know him?

362
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:26,642
The horticulturist.

363
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:30,113
Remember I told you
I was building

364
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,813
a hydroponic orchard
in my house?

365
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:36,192
Well, he started
working this week.

366
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,760
He arrived on Monday, very early.

367
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:40,055
An early bird!

368
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:49,764
Well, I saw him
and I liked him immediately,

369
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:54,804
then the morning passed

370
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,381
and I looked out
to see him in the garden

371
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:02,819
...and then at midday
I gave him some lunch,

372
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,684
because he had been
working all morning,

373
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:06,450
poor thing,
under the sun.

374
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:08,684
- OK.
- Poor thing... imagine.

375
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:13,658
And I couldn't stop looking
at him through the window,

376
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:18,634
I was like obsessed.
I was feeling things,

377
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:20,704
I was like his slave...

378
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,937
I saw him working and,

379
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:33,508
and it was then when
I think, I had an orgasm.

380
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:35,719
You had an orgasm?

381
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:39,686
But did you touch yourself?
A little bit.

382
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:42,621
And did you feel
pleasure?

383
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,596
Did you feel you got somewhere?

384
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:47,892
I don't know.

385
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:51,935
Did you like it?

386
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:56,669
Of course I did. I felt
something I had never felt...

387
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:58,401
...before.
Like electricity...

388
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:03,070
But, he's not my husband,
can you imagine that?

389
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:04,944
What's wrong with that?
I feel terribly guilty

390
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:06,607
Hey, your husband has not
touched you in months

391
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:08,948
And this man
did not touch you.

392
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:13,422
I wish he had touched you.
I can't get him off my mind.

393
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:18,621
Where from? Come on,
there's nothing wrong with that.

394
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:21,198
Your lucky,
I'm glad for you.

395
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:24,928
But, what do I do?
It doesn't feel right.

396
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:30,704
You have to be faithful...

397
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:34,403
Yes you're right.
I totally agree with you.

398
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,173
I have a husband...
And whether I like it or...

399
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,747
I'm not talking about
your husband.

400
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,942
I'm saying you have
to be faithful to yourself.

401
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:44,285
To your nature...
This is your life...

402
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:47,623
Your husband may be
an accident in your life

403
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:51,690
But your orgasms
are your responsibility.

404
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,591
You follow
the path of the orgasm.

405
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:58,097
Orgasms are a human right.

406
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:12,973
I have called you
a hundred times.

407
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,618
I must have had my cell phone

408
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,882
turned off after the meeting...

409
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:23,918
I thought you were
with Cecilia Ureta but no,

410
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:27,020
I just saw her
on the news.

411
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:30,259
In a fire in a motel.
Naked.

412
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:32,097
Can you tell me what's going on?

413
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:34,034
Who were you with?

414
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:38,472
I was in a meeting.
Look at me,

415
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,009
...who were you with?
I was in a meeting

416
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:41,738
...Cecilia didn't turn up.

417
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:44,838
We found out what happened,
I was going to tell you now but...

418
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,408
excuse me
I'm going to the toilet.

419
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:50,543
Excuse me
I'm going to the toilet.

420
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,405
Sorry, I only told you
what Cecilia asked me to say.

421
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:49,446
She's my friend.
Come on!

422
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:52,575
I wander how many
guys you have slept...

423
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:54,981
...with in these
production meetings.

424
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:57,611
If you had charged for it
we would be millionaires.

425
00:35:57,722 --> 00:36:00,020
Hey, please, Alvaro,
ask whomever you want.

426
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:01,989
But who am I going to ask?

427
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:04,825
The asshole that's
sleeping with you now?

428
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,688
Come on, say the truth.

429
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:12,101
Say the fucking
truth for once.

430
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:14,195
Here's all Cecilia's production
phone numbers.

431
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:17,331
Please ask one by one
who have I slept with.

432
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:18,772
Don't be ridiculous!

433
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,080
Who's going to
answer this late.

434
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,412
As if they were sleeping
after what happened.

435
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:27,417
You know what?

436
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:29,753
I'm going out and
when I come back

437
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,583
you'll have to
tell me the truth.

438
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:56,170
Good evening.

439
00:36:56,914 --> 00:37:01,578
Good evening.
I am the husband.

440
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:07,082
Good evening.
Well, your wife is alright.

441
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:11,252
Her vital signs are stable
and she will recover soon.

442
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:18,329
That's good.
Can I see her?

443
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:22,263
We are waiting for her
to regain conscience.

444
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:26,577
Jaime,
another whisky, please.

445
00:37:26,612 --> 00:37:27,942
Hey, come on,
calm down.

446
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:29,706
No, no, it's about me.

447
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:31,543
It's about me not about her

448
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:32,980
I don't give a shit about her.

449
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:35,416
It's my honor,
my pride

450
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:37,714
The shame that
I have to go through.

451
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:38,914
Take it easy.

452
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,722
They are looking
at us, man.

453
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:47,425
Hey, look,
Carola is a loyal woman.

454
00:37:47,531 --> 00:37:49,192
She's helping Cecilia.

455
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,632
You got confused
and paranoid.

456
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:53,636
No, no, I am not
paranoid at all.

457
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,838
I know there's something
else. I don't know what it is.

458
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,237
I know there is
something else.

459
00:37:57,508 --> 00:37:58,532
I have this doubt.

460
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:00,941
I want to know whether
she's fucking me or not.

461
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,769
If she's unfaithful or not.

462
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,177
Lower your voice,
lower your voice.

463
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,340
I can't.

464
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,438
Take it easy.

465
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:15,753
Somebody gave me this,
but I don't need it.

466
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:18,689
Here, this may help you.
What is this?

467
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,991
Lts for cuckolds.
What do you mean cuckold?

468
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:23,589
For paranoids.
How do you mean paranoid?

469
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,262
Well, they work in infidelities.

470
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,634
Hey, do you want to
find out the truth or not?

471
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,865
They can help you.

472
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:32,566
Vilches y Liverona

473
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:38,007
Hey,
are you going to be alright?

474
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,846
Don't worry about me.
I'll be fine.

475
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:43,385
Stay calm.
We have work tomorrow.

476
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:44,647
It's going to be a tough day

477
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:46,890
Just one more drink
and I leave.

478
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:47,889
So I can go now then.

479
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,859
Yes. Please, I mean no,
no... you can leave

480
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:51,861
You're going to be alright?

481
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:53,486
Yes, I'll be fine,
I'll be fine.

482
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:58,793
Take care. Relax.
Relax!

483
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,664
You don't know
the amount of money

484
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:33,532
...that I spent
in the hair stylist.

485
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:37,334
Charming, waxed,
lots of perfume

486
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:39,671
you know?
Nothing.

487
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:42,268
The champagne was there,
the glasses,

488
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,247
I wanted to do it all.

489
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:48,409
The school girl, the nun,

490
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:54,451
the whore,
the nurse. Nothing.

491
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:56,852
Tell me about it.

492
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:58,451
And then
he got home angry,

493
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,359
speaking on the cell phone,
of course.

494
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:01,556
Typical.
He throws his jacket,

495
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:03,064
then sits turns on theTV.
And then...

496
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:06,398
starts telling me a story
about a Japanese executive

497
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:08,699
that planted lettuces
in some sort of sponge.

498
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:09,738
What do I know?

499
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:13,172
What do I care about
lettuces in a sponge?

500
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,648
That must be Roberta's flight.

501
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,574
Are you carrying
something like pastrami?

502
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:22,583
No, sir.

503
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:25,312
Could you open your suitcase,
please?

504
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,253
Yes, sure.

505
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:32,021
You know, miss that despite
the international treaties

506
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:34,393
and the free commerce
agreements

507
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:36,193
that we have with
the rest of the foreign countries,

508
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,734
it is strictly forbidden
to bring to our territory

509
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:41,806
any kind of animal,
vegetables, mineral and others...

510
00:40:41,841 --> 00:40:44,934
that may jeopardize
our fellow citizen's health.

511
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:46,099
Yes.

512
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:56,213
And this is for personal
or commercial use?

513
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,015
Personal.

514
00:40:58,355 --> 00:41:00,220
Nothing at all.

515
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:03,521
An hour and a half.

516
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:07,163
I better turn the engine of.

517
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:08,390
It was about time.

518
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:12,429
Hey, do you know
how much the fuel costs?

519
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:13,468
No, How much?

520
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:15,462
What?

521
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:16,633
550 pesos.

522
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:20,037
We have to change this truck.

523
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,806
Why, man?
We just cannot afford it.

524
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:24,039
We'll have to make an effort.

525
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,843
No, I don't want to
make more efforts.

526
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,918
I want to change this truck.
I don't like it.

527
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,477
Lets buy a city car.

528
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:33,382
A what?
A city car.

529
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:35,456
What's that? Don't you
know what a city car is?

530
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:36,457
No idea.

531
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,994
It's a concept
the Japanese invented

532
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:42,327
which is a
car for the city, cheaper,

533
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:44,060
smaller and much
more comfortable.

534
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:46,736
What are we going to do
when we go to the beach?

535
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,464
I'm not going back to Llo Lleo.

536
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:49,934
What's wrong with Llo Lleo?

537
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,632
I don't like it.
I don't like Llo Lleo.

538
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:53,733
Smells like fish.
I don't like it. I hate it

539
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,744
Llo Lleo, Llo Lleo,
it reminds me of a joke.

540
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:56,746
Which one?

541
00:41:56,747 --> 00:41:58,811
The one about the queers...

542
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:02,852
I hate thatjoke.
You're a pain.

543
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:04,115
You have to make fun
about everything

544
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,277
The thing is make fun
of everything.

545
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:08,118
What's up?

546
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:36,448
My pussycat.

547
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:40,213
What's this wonderful surprise?

548
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:42,584
We have to talk.

549
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,025
Come in then.
What's that look on your face?

550
00:42:56,974 --> 00:43:01,604
Look, I'm not going to
wait for a fucking erotic dream

551
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:03,543
to come to my bed
to have pleasure.

552
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:05,114
No, I think it's far out
of the question.

553
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:07,450
Do you want to end
up like her?

554
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:09,547
No, dummy.

555
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:14,118
What will she be like?

556
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:15,851
Who? The Spaniard?
Charming.

557
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,391
She's not from Spain.

558
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:20,588
She has been in Spain
for about 8 years.

559
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:22,563
Yes, but she is Chilean.

560
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:24,429
How long does it take
a Chilean to stop being one?

561
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:25,559
She takes a plane
and that's it.

562
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:26,567
Arrives in Miami,
takes her bra off

563
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:27,568
and she wont say huevon ever again.

564
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:32,068
We're gathered here
to say goodbye

565
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:33,871
to a great man.

566
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:37,174
A man of those
that unfortunately

567
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,748
are very few left

568
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:43,178
His generosity,
his righteousness,

569
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:47,189
will make the ones
that met him difficult to forget.

570
00:43:48,225 --> 00:43:49,783
His kind soul.

571
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,286
Excuse me, father.

572
00:43:51,428 --> 00:43:53,589
It seems that you have
mistaken the deceased.

573
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:54,629
Excuse me?

574
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:03,705
Inside this coffin
there is no great man.

575
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:07,573
So lets get this over
and done with

576
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,745
and lets go to the channel.

577
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:11,439
There is a lot to do.

578
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:23,715
I, I can talk to him.
Tell him that I love you.

579
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:30,557
I will die.

580
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,158
He will understand,
I promise.

581
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:36,399
And after that what?

582
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:39,965
Then, even if
It sounds childish,

583
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:41,442
even if it is foolish,

584
00:44:41,545 --> 00:44:42,479
we grab my bike
and we go far away.

585
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:43,414
We grab my bike
and we go far away.

586
00:44:43,449 --> 00:44:44,972
We go to Mendoza

587
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:47,141
and make love
in every corner, love.

588
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:52,951
Look at me.
We leave together.

589
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,819
Don't make things
more difficult.

590
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:05,065
Look at me.
Yes, look at me.

591
00:45:05,169 --> 00:45:16,603
You, you love me.
You love me,

592
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:25,281
because if you don't
I'll disappear. I leave.

593
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:28,085
And you will never
see me again.

594
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:31,184
Do you love me?

595
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:43,764
I love you.

596
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:47,833
I love you.
I love you.

597
00:45:47,945 --> 00:46:07,930
Then lets leave.

598
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:10,160
We won't see each other
for a while, ok?

599
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:12,326
For a while? Why?

600
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:19,673
Until things calm down.

601
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:23,907
Promise me you're not
going to do anything foolish.

602
00:46:24,014 --> 00:46:26,107
Promise me, ok?

603
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:30,007
Be apart for a while.
Be apart for a while.

604
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:32,604
What is that shit.

605
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:38,750
What the fuck means
to be apart.

606
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:40,820
Shut up.

607
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:53,036
Lets go on to another topic.
Cecilia Ureta.

608
00:47:53,071 --> 00:47:53,798
Mrs. Vial,

609
00:47:54,004 --> 00:47:56,438
I imagine you'll want to
cancel her contract.

610
00:47:56,573 --> 00:47:59,974
Zavala,
you have very little imagination.

611
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:03,475
Allow me to remind you
that Cecilia Ureta's program

612
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:06,071
is the one that has the
most important amount

613
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:08,048
of publicity in this channel.

614
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,611
So whether we like it or not,

615
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,951
Cecilia Ureta sells.

616
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:15,355
Her eyes sell,
her legs sell,

617
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:21,459
her lips sell.
Even her infidelity sells

618
00:48:21,798 --> 00:48:23,857
So as soon as
she's recovered

619
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:25,662
I want her back in this channel.

620
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:29,466
But we don't know when

621
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:31,871
she will be in condition to do so.

622
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:37,172
Thus, we will have to
find someone to replace her.

623
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:40,876
Mario Guzman.
I think he won that position.

624
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:43,883
Make sure you contract
Eva Soler,

625
00:48:43,987 --> 00:48:45,386
I want her together
with Guzman.

626
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:48,490
Lets talk more about
the Spanish woman.

627
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,753
What was that impressed
you so much about her?

628
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:55,228
To see her happy.
She was happy.

629
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:57,892
She was feminine,
an arrogance,

630
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:01,196
a smile,
do you get me?

631
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:04,607
I mean, it makes me question
my own life. I hate that.

632
00:49:04,642 --> 00:49:07,910
And then when I went to
drop her off at the hotel,

633
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:11,710
sure, we had a nice conversation

634
00:49:11,815 --> 00:49:15,842
but there came a moment when
I felt like crying my heart out.

635
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:20,482
Because,
how I wish to have

636
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,649
the bottle of champagne
in the soul, like her.

637
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,450
There she is,
there she is.

638
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:25,357
Is it her or not?

639
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:26,929
She's stunning.

640
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:32,493
Show the sign...
show the sign. It's upside down.

641
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:36,528
Further up, further up...
she can't see it.

642
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,001
Hello, Roberta?

643
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:42,908
Yes, Cristina Mujica,
pleased to meet you.

644
00:49:42,946 --> 00:49:43,946
My pleasure.

645
00:49:43,947 --> 00:49:47,238
Sorry, they are two,
In Spain they are two.

646
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:50,946
She is Virginia Zaldivar,
our architect.

647
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:53,545
Pleased to meet you.
One, two.

648
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:56,416
Well, how was your trip?

649
00:49:56,526 --> 00:49:59,256
Excellent. Very good.
Good.

650
00:49:59,363 --> 00:50:01,126
How long have you been
away from Chile?

651
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:03,165
Since I went crazy.

652
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:09,135
Too crazy?
Very crazy, very crazy.

653
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:10,970
Really?

654
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:43,801
Pretty nice.

655
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:53,343
Are we professional
or are we not professional? We are.

656
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:56,317
Ok, Ok

657
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:20,137
For a beer

658
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,758
We got him.

659
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:53,340
No...
This is what we call an asshole.

660
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:54,808
No, super asshole.

661
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:03,314
Somebody that
we can use as counterpoint

662
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:04,853
to Eva Soler's comments

663
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,947
Somebody that thinks absolutely
the opposite to create polemic.

664
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:09,719
A psychologist.
No, not a psychologist

665
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:10,850
...I don't think so

666
00:52:11,261 --> 00:52:14,753
A psychologist...
on one hand we have the theory

667
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:17,163
and I need real information,
concrete data.

668
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:18,928
Did you talk to Eva Soler?
Yes, Mario.

669
00:52:19,035 --> 00:52:21,697
Go to your office,
everything is fine, go and relax.

670
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:22,601
OK.

671
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,794
Is she going to die, dad?

672
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:48,396
No, sweetheart.

673
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,111
Does it hurt her a lot?

674
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:15,016
No, it doesn't hurt
because she's sleeping.

675
00:53:18,295 --> 00:53:20,627
Maybe when she wakes up.

676
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:31,632
Poor sucker.
Poor super sucker.

677
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:34,507
Imagine when he finds out
that his wife is unfaithful.

678
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:36,476
Thank God the video
does not show

679
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:37,547
the guy's face.

680
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:40,241
The only thing I want is not
to be there when that happens.

681
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:48,317
Hello, Vilches y Liverona.

682
00:53:48,491 --> 00:53:51,051
I'll put you through.

683
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:54,963
Who is it?

684
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:57,398
It's for us,
from channel 6.

685
00:53:57,534 --> 00:53:59,024
Why don't you answer?

686
00:53:59,135 --> 00:54:01,194
Because it seems that we
have a secretary this way.

687
00:54:01,304 --> 00:54:07,268
Jerk. A secretary with a
cell phone. Yes, hello.

688
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:18,274
Look, what I cannot
understand is

689
00:55:18,381 --> 00:55:21,282
how somebody can sleep
with another person

690
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:23,147
to save his or her marriage.

691
00:55:23,286 --> 00:55:26,187
But, do you think
there are two different things?

692
00:55:27,123 --> 00:55:28,647
I think that there are things

693
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:31,056
more important than sex
in marriage, Cristina.

694
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:33,388
A lot more.
Hey, sorry,

695
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:34,986
how long has it been since
you've had an orgasm?

696
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:40,698
Come on, answer.

697
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:43,772
Tell us, tell us.
You haven't had any.

698
00:55:43,873 --> 00:55:46,933
How could I have
had none, Cristina.

699
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:50,472
And the rest of the times
you pretend you have orgasms?

700
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:54,878
No, not me.
I swear.

701
00:55:57,954 --> 00:56:01,515
Oh, my God.
This is getting like a real city.

702
00:56:02,158 --> 00:56:05,457
Hey, where would you
put a sex shop?

703
00:56:06,763 --> 00:56:08,731
Here in Santiago?
Yes.

704
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:12,424
I don't know.

705
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:14,196
We would have to
make a market research first.

706
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:15,862
Sure.
Do that first.

707
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:18,440
But is there a sex shop already?

708
00:56:20,643 --> 00:56:21,610
I don't know.

709
00:56:22,946 --> 00:56:25,938
I am already married.
So?

710
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:27,873
I don't use those products.

711
00:56:27,984 --> 00:56:29,144
Look, and you know what's best?

712
00:56:29,252 --> 00:56:33,120
They don't like football.
That's ugly!

713
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:35,953
It's disgusting!
And it vibrates.

714
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,391
It vibrates!

715
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:42,291
Keep it.
Keep it.

716
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:43,831
I assure you it will
bring something new

717
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:45,264
to your marriage.
Let me touch it.

718
00:56:45,368 --> 00:56:46,665
Are you crazy?

719
00:56:46,803 --> 00:56:48,794
Es blandito y pegajoso.

720
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:54,570
You will design
the store for my business

721
00:56:54,677 --> 00:56:55,439
isn't that so?

722
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:02,181
I didn't know that the store
would sell sex products.

723
00:57:02,285 --> 00:57:03,379
Yes, it is.

724
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:06,089
Well,
if you're going to work with me

725
00:57:06,124 --> 00:57:09,217
the first thing
you have to do

726
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:11,316
is open your mind
and make it possible.

727
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:14,897
It suits you.

728
00:57:15,231 --> 00:57:16,994
Things one has
to do for work.

729
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,227
And that goes for you too.

730
00:57:19,335 --> 00:57:23,294
We have to break
the taboos in this city.

731
00:57:23,406 --> 00:57:25,966
We have to
offer fantasy,

732
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:30,011
I don't know...
sex quality is life quality.

733
00:57:31,014 --> 00:57:32,811
Unbelievable, right?

734
00:57:34,984 --> 00:57:37,316
May I?
You're smoking again?

735
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,513
Yes, the first thing I decided

736
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,317
was to change
guilt for pleasure.

737
00:57:41,758 --> 00:57:43,521
Excellent.

738
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:46,528
Hey, look,
It looks like my husband.

739
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:51,928
And what do you think
about Virginia?

740
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:54,162
Listening to her scared me.

741
00:57:54,337 --> 00:57:56,237
What scared you?

742
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:59,067
I mean,
resign myselfjust like her

743
00:57:59,209 --> 00:58:01,609
...no, I mean really, no.

744
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:03,201
I don't want to be unfaithful

745
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,940
but I don't want
to languish either,

746
00:58:05,048 --> 00:58:09,644
do you get me?
I don't know...

747
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:16,891
And what will you do?

748
00:58:16,926 --> 00:58:20,225
Work with Roberta
for the time being.

749
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,820
See if they miss me
at home.

750
00:58:56,533 --> 00:59:01,197
Camila, Camila.

751
00:59:03,172 --> 00:59:04,400
Camila,

752
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:07,305
Francisco is going to
take her away from me.

753
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:09,275
No, take it easy.
That will never happen.

754
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,244
Alberto, Alberto.

755
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:26,893
Silly, I promise
I will always be here.

756
00:59:28,965 --> 00:59:30,227
Calm down now.

757
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:29,090
Shit!
This thing is running away!

758
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:36,690
Virginia!

759
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:40,202
Mother.

760
01:00:40,837 --> 01:00:45,171
I hope your conscience
is not as dirty as this.

761
01:00:45,274 --> 01:00:46,707
Don't be silly.

762
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:55,713
Hello,

763
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,084
I came to speak
to you man to man.

764
01:01:11,934 --> 01:01:14,869
Look for some time now,
Carola and I have, well,

765
01:01:14,971 --> 01:01:18,463
Carola and I...

766
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:31,152
I have concrete proof that
Carola is screwing somebody.

767
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:36,651
Do you want to see?
Look.

768
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:57,703
While I work!
While I work.

769
01:01:57,814 --> 01:01:59,543
Well that's the reason then...

770
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:01,583
While you work

771
01:02:03,486 --> 01:02:06,683
...the only thing you care
about is yourjob.

772
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:07,687
Are you on her side,
man?

773
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:10,850
No, I'm not.
What I'm saying dad is

774
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,285
that all your life
the only thing

775
01:02:13,296 --> 01:02:14,321
you have cared
about is work,

776
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:17,299
work, work, work,
and the people who love you,

777
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,890
where do you leave them?

778
01:02:19,001 --> 01:02:20,935
But what the fuck
is wrong with that.

779
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,606
Nothing bad,
nothing bad, dad.

780
01:02:23,607 --> 01:02:24,695
I'm only telling you

781
01:02:24,696 --> 01:02:27,274
what I think as your son.
That's it.

782
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:35,810
Do you need money?

783
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:38,454
No, no.
What I need is less important,

784
01:02:38,489 --> 01:02:39,648
it doesn't matter.

785
01:02:40,523 --> 01:02:42,252
I'm glad you came.

786
01:03:04,714 --> 01:03:05,476
Another one?

787
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:06,946
Yeah.

788
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:11,050
Relax, man.

789
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,682
Broads are like buses

790
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:17,453
you get off one
and get on another one.

791
01:03:26,402 --> 01:03:28,461
Broads are like buses,

792
01:03:33,376 --> 01:03:37,278
you get off one
and get on another one.

793
01:03:39,415 --> 01:03:41,645
Cheers for that.
To buses!

794
01:03:48,791 --> 01:03:51,453
The ten commandments
of the unfaithful woman.

795
01:03:51,561 --> 01:03:53,051
By Vilches y Liverona.

796
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:57,326
The ten commandments
of the unfaithful woman,

797
01:03:57,934 --> 01:04:02,236
I loved it. I loved it.

798
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:03,932
I think we are
going to make it with this one.

799
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,234
The last ten shows.

800
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:07,138
And how much
will we get paid

801
01:04:07,243 --> 01:04:09,074
for participating
in the show?

802
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:11,442
I don't manage that part.

803
01:04:11,547 --> 01:04:13,139
My executive producer
sees that.

804
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:16,181
We prefer to deal with you.

805
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:19,181
We know each other,
we know our faces...

806
01:04:20,056 --> 01:04:23,685
I don't know.
Two millions, is that alright?

807
01:04:27,597 --> 01:04:29,531
I told you.
I told you.

808
01:04:29,665 --> 01:04:31,223
I told you Liber.
I told you.

809
01:04:31,334 --> 01:04:33,029
Don't call me Liber,
call me Liberona.

810
01:04:33,135 --> 01:04:34,261
Liberona,
I told you.

811
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:36,463
Mrs. Ureta was a lot more...

812
01:04:36,572 --> 01:04:39,769
Excuse me...
Cecilia? Cecilia Ureta?

813
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:41,343
Yes, sir.

814
01:04:41,444 --> 01:04:45,403
She offered us double
for this.

815
01:04:56,425 --> 01:04:59,952
We have to get together with her
to hand her these pictures today

816
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:01,359
...but she's not available...

817
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:04,558
And because you
invited us to your show...

818
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:21,810
Which is the best mall?

819
01:05:23,185 --> 01:05:26,780
No,
you don't intend to sell

820
01:05:26,889 --> 01:05:28,186
your toys in a mall...

821
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:32,725
Of course, it's a modern
and pretty place,

822
01:05:32,828 --> 01:05:35,490
with unsatisfied people
and with lots of money.

823
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:39,200
Yes, but I don't know
how much you remember

824
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:43,534
this country but these
women do not kill boredom

825
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:46,403
buying silicone dicks

826
01:05:46,509 --> 01:05:50,104
and specially in place
where they can be seen.

827
01:05:50,212 --> 01:05:51,337
And what do they do?

828
01:05:51,747 --> 01:05:53,146
They get bored.

829
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,384
They get bored,
or we get bored?

830
01:05:58,955 --> 01:05:59,944
Yes, I understand,

831
01:06:00,056 --> 01:06:03,150
they learn to live with boredom

832
01:06:03,259 --> 01:06:05,022
as if it were a pet, right?

833
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:08,123
Something like that.

834
01:06:09,265 --> 01:06:10,357
You know what?

835
01:06:11,167 --> 01:06:13,200
That has got to
change some day.

836
01:06:13,235 --> 01:06:16,693
One day women will
decide to sacrifice their pet

837
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:19,507
and won't feel
guilty and think

838
01:06:19,542 --> 01:06:23,034
that God will punish
them with hell.

839
01:06:23,779 --> 01:06:27,681
Furthermore, I think
each one owns their happiness

840
01:06:28,017 --> 01:06:32,010
Not the husband,
the mother or the children,

841
01:06:32,121 --> 01:06:33,645
not even your lover
is going to come

842
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:36,657
and solve your life. No.

843
01:06:41,697 --> 01:06:43,961
Lets talk about you.

844
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:47,499
Are you married?

845
01:06:47,603 --> 01:06:50,470
I am happy.
And you?

846
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,601
No.
I mean I'm married.

847
01:06:58,147 --> 01:07:00,479
Alvaro is absolutely paranoid,

848
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:01,811
he's crazy, he's sick.

849
01:07:02,585 --> 01:07:03,882
What would you do?

850
01:07:04,053 --> 01:07:06,783
I'd kill her.
You wouldn't?

851
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:11,823
Well, I don't know.

852
01:07:11,927 --> 01:07:13,656
If you don't know,
who does?

853
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:16,027
I think one has to have
a clear point of view in life,

854
01:07:16,132 --> 01:07:17,724
about every issue, abortion,

855
01:07:17,833 --> 01:07:19,061
the pill, infidelity as well.

856
01:07:19,168 --> 01:07:22,729
Yes, you're right,
but Virginita is different,

857
01:07:22,838 --> 01:07:24,601
she would never
be unfaithful to her husband.

858
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:26,868
She's different.
Different from Cristina?

859
01:07:27,443 --> 01:07:31,812
Yes, I mean no,
I mean yes and no

860
01:07:31,914 --> 01:07:32,881
Do you get me?

861
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:35,813
Virginita is a
structured person.

862
01:07:35,951 --> 01:07:45,161
Timid. Look...
sex makes her suffer.

863
01:07:45,196 --> 01:07:47,527
What would her have a lover for

864
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:49,291
She's not interested in sex.

865
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:50,262
Neither does Cristina.

866
01:07:50,366 --> 01:07:52,027
She's not interested in sex?

867
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:57,737
No, she loves sex.
I satisfy all her needs.

868
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:59,974
She has one orgasm
after the other.

869
01:08:00,709 --> 01:08:03,075
Incredible,
you should listen to her

870
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:04,840
You are lucky!

871
01:08:05,714 --> 01:08:12,517
Excuse me. It's her.
Hello, love. Hi, what?

872
01:08:12,621 --> 01:08:16,785
Later?
Don't worry, love,

873
01:08:16,892 --> 01:08:20,020
I'll wait for you. Kiss... Bye.

874
01:08:20,162 --> 01:08:21,754
What happened?

875
01:08:21,897 --> 01:08:22,659
She'll get home later.

876
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:24,562
She's having dinner
with a client.

877
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:29,697
Don't get any ideas,
the client is a woman.

878
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:05,248
Cheers!

879
01:12:05,621 --> 01:12:10,058
For the times to come!
To silicone.

880
01:12:15,097 --> 01:12:18,897
Excellent.
Delicious.

881
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:24,230
Hey, five years of marriage.

882
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:25,068
And how does it go?

883
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:28,607
I don't know,
normal, I suppose.

884
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:31,305
Well, the truth is that we
don't see each other much.

885
01:12:31,447 --> 01:12:33,312
The truth is that

886
01:12:33,415 --> 01:12:34,848
I don't listen to him
and neither does he.

887
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:36,577
Can you bring me
olive oil?

888
01:12:36,752 --> 01:12:38,310
And when he talks
to me I don't understand

889
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:39,682
and he does not
understand me at all.

890
01:12:39,788 --> 01:12:42,120
Yes,
but I'm talking about sex.

891
01:12:42,224 --> 01:12:43,691
Do you get along in bed?

892
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:49,557
I don't know,
I can't imagine after 5 years.

893
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:53,665
I don't.
Nothing, nothing.

894
01:12:54,403 --> 01:12:55,370
But he doesn't know,

895
01:12:55,471 --> 01:12:57,063
he thinks he's
the perfect lover.

896
01:12:57,439 --> 01:12:58,667
And you know what?

897
01:12:58,774 --> 01:13:00,071
He doesn't even know
where the clitoris is.

898
01:13:00,175 --> 01:13:01,199
He understands nothing.

899
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:02,777
I think he doesn't
even know it exists.

900
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:04,277
And you know the worst of all?

901
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:05,745
Tell me.

902
01:13:05,848 --> 01:13:08,146
When he finishes
with that cheap imitation

903
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:10,878
of an unsaciable stud,

904
01:13:10,986 --> 01:13:13,352
he stares at you like,
I don't know,

905
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:14,854
as if I had to thank him,
you know?

906
01:13:14,957 --> 01:13:16,686
Your husband is a real jewel.

907
01:13:16,792 --> 01:13:18,623
Maybe you should
introduce him to me.

908
01:13:18,727 --> 01:13:19,659
Why not...

909
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:23,224
You know what?

910
01:13:24,032 --> 01:13:26,728
You may think
that I'm crazy,

911
01:13:26,835 --> 01:13:29,972
lost in the world,
and that I don't give a shit

912
01:13:30,007 --> 01:13:32,964
but I've never been unfaithful.

913
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:35,805
Really.
Thank you.

914
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:39,369
I haven't had the need.
I don't know,

915
01:13:39,515 --> 01:13:40,948
I don't feel
I belong to anybody

916
01:13:41,049 --> 01:13:42,573
and nobody
belongs to me.

917
01:13:43,318 --> 01:13:45,513
When I have been
with somebody it's just that.

918
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:49,251
I have fun,
I have a good time,

919
01:13:49,358 --> 01:13:51,383
I fall madly in love
and when it's over

920
01:13:51,493 --> 01:13:52,892
it's over and that's it.

921
01:13:52,995 --> 01:13:53,757
But don't you sufer?

922
01:13:54,696 --> 01:13:57,392
Yes, I do,
but it soon goes away

923
01:13:57,499 --> 01:14:00,730
and I let go.
We have to enjoy.

924
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:04,497
It doesn't hurt?

925
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:09,399
What?
Depends on the size right?

926
01:14:10,312 --> 01:14:11,404
And where...

927
01:14:12,347 --> 01:14:16,306
Hey! I'm learning,
I'm learning.

928
01:14:18,053 --> 01:14:19,714
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

929
01:14:19,855 --> 01:14:20,880
Better.

930
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:23,323
I was at your place
and brought you some things.

931
01:14:26,762 --> 01:14:28,753
I was with Camilita.

932
01:14:28,864 --> 01:14:30,893
How is she?

933
01:14:30,928 --> 01:14:32,923
Missing you.

934
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:37,161
I'm not getting
out of here, Carola.

935
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:39,433
What will you do.
Stay here locked up forever?

936
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:42,174
Mario is going to do a show
that will tear you in pieces.

937
01:14:42,444 --> 01:14:44,036
You must get out of here.

938
01:14:47,583 --> 01:14:49,244
Good morning, Cecilia.

939
01:14:52,421 --> 01:14:54,446
I see that you're much better
than what your husband told me.

940
01:14:54,556 --> 01:14:55,750
I'm glad.

941
01:14:55,891 --> 01:14:58,451
Sorry, Teresa but I think
this is not the best time...

942
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:01,552
Honey, lets save time.
I want to talk to her.

943
01:15:04,867 --> 01:15:05,993
Leave us, Carola.

944
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:24,076
I had to assume the
management of the channel, Cecilia.

945
01:15:24,753 --> 01:15:26,186
And don't worry,

946
01:15:26,288 --> 01:15:28,188
I don't have
heartfeelings towards you.

947
01:15:29,658 --> 01:15:33,253
I want you back at work today.

948
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:37,458
I, I can't.
Yes, you can. Even more,

949
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:39,498
you are going to excuse yourself

950
01:15:39,601 --> 01:15:41,193
publicly for what happened.

951
01:15:42,437 --> 01:15:44,200
We have a contract

952
01:15:44,306 --> 01:15:46,501
and you'll have to stick to it.

953
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:50,842
Solve your family problems
and back to work.

954
01:15:50,946 --> 01:15:54,313
We pay you amounts
of money for something.

955
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:45,464
Come on.

956
01:17:15,597 --> 01:17:23,026
Hello. Yes, of course.
Unbelievable.

957
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:27,700
They are elite sportsmen.
Yes, sure.

958
01:17:27,843 --> 01:17:29,811
19 miles per hour at least

959
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:33,777
Fabulous, yes. Yes,

960
01:17:35,183 --> 01:17:39,017
Virginita is here, she's fine.

961
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:46,957
Of course, yes,

962
01:17:47,729 --> 01:17:53,725
will they show it again? OK, OK, bye.

963
01:18:13,655 --> 01:18:19,025
Honey... Virginita.

964
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:22,789
Do we have batteries somewhere?

965
01:18:22,898 --> 01:18:24,627
They're going to show
the goals again.

966
01:18:26,234 --> 01:18:29,761
We don't have batteries, love.

967
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:37,812
Are you OK?
Yes.

968
01:18:39,781 --> 01:18:42,011
Honey,
do you have a tummy ache?

969
01:18:47,589 --> 01:18:50,057
Poor thing.

970
01:18:51,793 --> 01:18:55,562
Pain, sadness,

971
01:18:55,597 --> 01:18:57,997
anguish is what I feel today

972
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:02,196
for our workmate.
How are you?

973
01:19:02,304 --> 01:19:03,393
Fine.

974
01:19:14,683 --> 01:19:15,411
What's that?

975
01:19:15,550 --> 01:19:17,916
You know very well
what this is.

976
01:19:18,019 --> 01:19:20,010
But why did they
bring them here?

977
01:19:20,655 --> 01:19:23,249
We want our money
before the show.

978
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:24,589
What was our agreement?

979
01:19:24,726 --> 01:19:27,524
We were going to pay you, right?

980
01:19:27,662 --> 01:19:28,720
One thing are my problems,

981
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:30,457
another thing is the show
Alright?

982
01:19:30,565 --> 01:19:35,025
OK, man.
You know what we learnt

983
01:19:35,137 --> 01:19:37,970
when we started this business?

984
01:19:38,673 --> 01:19:40,038
Not to trust.

985
01:19:41,476 --> 01:19:44,707
Go talk to the productor
and then you go to makeup, OK?

986
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:48,438
Hey, listen,
as Tony Caluga said...

987
01:19:49,251 --> 01:19:53,312
No money, no Tony.

988
01:20:21,416 --> 01:20:22,781
Come in.

989
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:32,483
You must be the ones
for the check, right?

990
01:20:33,028 --> 01:20:36,862
Vilches and Liberona.
Pleased to meet you.

991
01:20:36,965 --> 01:20:38,830
You don't know how glad
we are to find you.

992
01:20:39,067 --> 01:20:40,830
I imagine,
6 and a half millions

993
01:20:40,936 --> 01:20:45,703
is a sum to make you glad.
There.

994
01:20:49,544 --> 01:20:52,604
No, no.
Make another one for 2 millions.

995
01:20:54,549 --> 01:20:55,641
Explain it to her.

996
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:58,412
A 2 and 6 ceros.
Liber.

997
01:20:59,087 --> 01:21:01,487
Explain about the 2 millions.

998
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:06,323
Your husband hired us.
He suspects you.

999
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:09,027
Well and the worst
part of ourjob

1000
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:12,031
is having to say
the truth to the client.

1001
01:21:12,133 --> 01:21:14,033
So, Alvaro is not
going to know

1002
01:21:14,135 --> 01:21:17,662
that it is his son...

1003
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:20,198
Carola, listen to me...

1004
01:21:21,109 --> 01:21:23,134
Go away,
I know everything.

1005
01:21:23,245 --> 01:21:24,769
These men just told me.

1006
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:29,047
These are the fuckers

1007
01:21:29,217 --> 01:21:33,620
You... What's
the matter with you?

1008
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:36,452
No, no, no.

1009
01:21:42,330 --> 01:21:43,991
I paid them. Lets go.

1010
01:21:44,099 --> 01:21:46,465
They say Alvaro
doesn't know. Lets go.

1011
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:52,138
That's how you make a living...

1012
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:54,606
3 millions now, jerk. 3 millions.

1013
01:21:54,709 --> 01:22:00,475
Cute. Bravo, bravo,

1014
01:22:02,417 --> 01:22:06,183
you'll make me
and my old man separate.

1015
01:22:07,522 --> 01:22:08,716
For some time, yes,

1016
01:22:08,823 --> 01:22:11,451
but then we are going to reconcile

1017
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:14,488
And we'll go after you.

1018
01:22:15,497 --> 01:22:16,327
No.

1019
01:22:17,632 --> 01:22:19,497
I feel sorry for you.

1020
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:23,196
You sorry fuckers.
You faggots.

1021
01:22:23,338 --> 01:22:25,465
Carola, listen to me.
Listen to me.

1022
01:22:25,573 --> 01:22:28,906
We'll do it my way now.
No more lies.

1023
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:32,207
Faggots, fuckers.

1024
01:22:39,888 --> 01:22:40,946
We screwed up, man.

1025
01:22:44,726 --> 01:22:45,624
How are you?

1026
01:22:52,033 --> 01:22:54,160
He broke our briefcase, man.

1027
01:23:03,178 --> 01:23:05,738
Is he there? Is he there?

1028
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:27,400
Son of a bitch.
How can you do this?

1029
01:23:27,502 --> 01:23:28,730
What are you doing with her?

1030
01:23:28,837 --> 01:23:30,464
What are you doing with Carola?

1031
01:23:30,572 --> 01:23:32,403
I'm your father,
don't you get it?

1032
01:23:32,774 --> 01:23:33,968
Take it easy,
calm down.

1033
01:23:34,075 --> 01:23:36,168
I'm your father,
how can you do this to me?

1034
01:23:36,277 --> 01:23:40,179
Did you go crazy?
What's in your mind?

1035
01:23:40,281 --> 01:23:44,183
She's my woman.
This is wrong, man.

1036
01:23:44,919 --> 01:23:46,580
Calm down, man.

1037
01:23:46,688 --> 01:23:48,178
How do you mean
calm down?

1038
01:23:48,289 --> 01:23:50,689
Take it easy.

1039
01:23:50,992 --> 01:23:56,487
We did not want to hurt you...

1040
01:23:58,066 --> 01:23:59,090
That's what you told me.

1041
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:01,566
This woman

1042
01:24:01,669 --> 01:24:06,106
Shameless.

1043
01:24:08,376 --> 01:24:11,709
How embarrassing!

1044
01:24:11,846 --> 01:24:15,213
Come here.
You got to have bad luck!

1045
01:24:15,316 --> 01:24:17,011
The whole country new.

1046
01:24:17,118 --> 01:24:19,313
Imagine.
Everybody. Everybody.

1047
01:24:26,127 --> 01:24:29,563
Know what? It finished.

1048
01:24:30,932 --> 01:24:33,958
Hey?
What?

1049
01:24:35,036 --> 01:24:36,128
It looks different from here.

1050
01:24:38,039 --> 01:24:40,633
The world is really
changing now

1051
01:24:41,709 --> 01:24:49,117
Hey?
How do you think whores do it?

1052
01:24:49,152 --> 01:24:51,847
Do whores feel unfaithful?

1053
01:24:52,821 --> 01:24:55,984
They arrive home
and feel horny again?

1054
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:59,891
Well, who knows

1055
01:24:59,994 --> 01:25:04,556
The pussy...
The pussy...

1056
01:25:04,699 --> 01:25:06,633
The fanny.
The fanny. The cunt.

1057
01:25:06,734 --> 01:25:09,168
The cunt.
The twat

1058
01:25:09,871 --> 01:25:12,169
The twat
The poontang

1059
01:25:12,807 --> 01:25:15,071
The carpet.

1060
01:25:15,176 --> 01:25:17,269
The fox.

1061
01:25:17,378 --> 01:25:20,745
The ass.
The cock lover.

1062
01:25:23,718 --> 01:25:24,878
I'm drunk.

1063
01:25:26,855 --> 01:25:30,484
Blood's gone to my head.
I'm dizzy.

1064
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:32,593
Do you want more wine?

1065
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:36,696
Yeah.
OK, I'll get it.

1066
01:25:36,798 --> 01:25:38,288
Why...

1067
01:25:38,433 --> 01:25:41,402
Drink up,
it's good for you.

1068
01:25:44,139 --> 01:25:48,803
It is very...
Good.

1069
01:29:07,075 --> 01:29:11,544
How can somebody
be so cynical.

1070
01:29:11,579 --> 01:29:16,013
Such a hypocrite,
such a liar.

1071
01:29:18,619 --> 01:29:22,055
I know I owe you an explanation
about what happened.

1072
01:29:22,156 --> 01:29:26,820
An explanation? You want to
give me an explanation?

1073
01:29:30,098 --> 01:29:31,861
You're such a fool.

1074
01:29:31,966 --> 01:29:34,491
You think an explanation
will fix things?

1075
01:29:34,635 --> 01:29:37,126
I don't want any explanations.

1076
01:29:37,472 --> 01:29:40,134
I want nothing from you.

1077
01:29:40,975 --> 01:29:43,443
I want you to grab your things
and leave my house.

1078
01:29:44,779 --> 01:29:48,180
But, but, think about Camilita.

1079
01:29:52,186 --> 01:29:56,350
Camilita,
did you think about her

1080
01:29:56,457 --> 01:29:58,322
when you were
screwing with another guy?

1081
01:30:00,495 --> 01:30:01,655
Listen to me.

1082
01:30:03,030 --> 01:30:08,662
I'll manage you don't see
Camila again.

1083
01:30:12,874 --> 01:30:15,468
You can't do that, Francisco.

1084
01:30:16,411 --> 01:30:26,286
Can't I? Can't I?
Of course I can.

1085
01:30:26,387 --> 01:30:28,878
I could put a bullet
in your head.

1086
01:30:29,023 --> 01:30:30,581
You bitch.

1087
01:30:36,898 --> 01:30:39,799
Are you afraid?

1088
01:30:39,834 --> 01:30:44,203
Are you afraid of dyeing?
Are you afraid of dyeing?

1089
01:30:45,473 --> 01:30:48,306
Would you like me to die?

1090
01:30:48,409 --> 01:30:50,206
Do you prefer me to die?

1091
01:30:51,746 --> 01:30:54,408
Do I pull the trigger?
Do I pull the trigger?

1092
01:30:54,782 --> 01:30:57,012
Would you like that?
Tell me.

1093
01:30:57,718 --> 01:31:00,710
Tell me, tell me,
and I'll do it right here.

1094
01:31:05,693 --> 01:31:08,787
I never was your priority.

1095
01:31:15,870 --> 01:31:18,134
And you were
never there for me.

1096
01:31:27,815 --> 01:31:30,750
Get out of my house.

1097
01:31:36,591 --> 01:31:37,785
Good evening.

1098
01:31:37,892 --> 01:31:42,158
Pain, sadness, anguish.

1099
01:31:42,263 --> 01:31:46,165
That is what I fell tonight
for our workmate Cecilia Ureta.

1100
01:31:46,567 --> 01:31:48,091
Another human being

1101
01:31:48,202 --> 01:31:50,067
We are with Eva Soler,

1102
01:31:50,171 --> 01:31:50,967
psychologist...

1103
01:31:51,072 --> 01:31:53,563
to help us understand

1104
01:31:53,674 --> 01:31:55,125
this difficult moment
that affects us all.

1105
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:56,818
This difficult moment
that affects us all.

1106
01:31:56,853 --> 01:31:58,477
Good evening, Eva.
Hello, good evening.

1107
01:31:58,779 --> 01:32:00,872
A few days ago
you surprised us all

1108
01:32:00,982 --> 01:32:02,381
with the results of a survey.

1109
01:32:02,483 --> 01:32:05,509
62% of the married women
in our country

1110
01:32:05,620 --> 01:32:07,554
is or has been unfaithful
to their couples.

1111
01:32:07,655 --> 01:32:08,917
The question is,

1112
01:32:09,023 --> 01:32:11,457
would you include
Cecilia in this figure?

1113
01:32:11,559 --> 01:32:14,790
Well, obviously, yes.

1114
01:32:14,929 --> 01:32:16,157
I don't think
it is that obvious

1115
01:32:16,264 --> 01:32:21,702
because Cecilia Ureta
is famous, a TV star.

1116
01:32:21,802 --> 01:32:24,134
People feel empathy for her

1117
01:32:24,238 --> 01:32:25,296
and tends to idealize her,

1118
01:32:25,406 --> 01:32:27,772
to the extreme
of transforming her

1119
01:32:27,775 --> 01:32:28,775
into a goddess.

1120
01:32:28,776 --> 01:32:31,701
So it is very hard for people

1121
01:32:31,812 --> 01:32:34,110
to understand that a God may

1122
01:32:34,215 --> 01:32:35,307
make a mistake.

1123
01:32:35,416 --> 01:32:39,250
I don't consider
she made a mistake.

1124
01:32:39,353 --> 01:32:40,615
I don't think that is the verb.

1125
01:32:40,721 --> 01:32:41,847
Excuse me,

1126
01:32:41,989 --> 01:32:44,890
you do not consider
infidelity a mistake?

1127
01:32:44,992 --> 01:32:47,825
You don't consider
it something abnormal.

1128
01:32:48,496 --> 01:32:51,226
No. What is normal?

1129
01:32:51,899 --> 01:32:53,230
What's not pathological.

1130
01:32:53,367 --> 01:32:57,133
If 62% of the women chooses,

1131
01:32:57,238 --> 01:33:00,366
assumes their infidelity,
then it's normal.

1132
01:33:00,708 --> 01:33:02,141
Like it has been for men

1133
01:33:02,243 --> 01:33:03,574
since the beginning of time.

1134
01:33:04,211 --> 01:33:08,045
Let's see, if I'm
not mistaken, according to you,

1135
01:33:08,149 --> 01:33:11,346
men would be guilty
of women's infidelity, right?

1136
01:33:11,452 --> 01:33:13,386
I didn't say guilty
I said accomplice.

1137
01:33:13,487 --> 01:33:14,749
It's different.

1138
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:18,184
Well,
the doctor is very sarcastic

1139
01:33:18,292 --> 01:33:22,463
...we are going to introduce you to

1140
01:33:22,498 --> 01:33:23,953
Mr, Vilches and Liberona

1141
01:33:24,065 --> 01:33:25,657
that are also in our studio.

1142
01:33:25,766 --> 01:33:27,324
They are private investigators,

1143
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:30,563
experts in women's infidelity.

1144
01:33:30,671 --> 01:33:33,367
Good evening, thank you
for being with us.

1145
01:33:33,474 --> 01:33:34,270
Good evening.

1146
01:33:34,375 --> 01:33:36,275
You were telling me,
off camera,

1147
01:33:36,377 --> 01:33:37,503
that there are
the 10 commandments

1148
01:33:37,612 --> 01:33:38,476
of the unfaithful woman.

1149
01:33:40,047 --> 01:33:42,379
There are many men
now in their homes

1150
01:33:42,483 --> 01:33:43,507
watching this programs

1151
01:33:44,118 --> 01:33:46,712
...some clues about
these ten commandments?

1152
01:33:48,255 --> 01:33:53,625
I would like to say
something before, Mario,

1153
01:33:53,728 --> 01:33:57,892
about what Mrs.
Eva said here,

1154
01:33:57,999 --> 01:34:01,093
in relation with normality,
normality,

1155
01:34:01,202 --> 01:34:03,796
I, deep inside,
philosophically agree with her

1156
01:34:03,904 --> 01:34:07,340
Normality. What is,
what is normality?

1157
01:34:07,441 --> 01:34:09,568
That is the topic that
we are talking about today

1158
01:34:09,677 --> 01:34:11,144
...to try to discover,

1159
01:34:11,245 --> 01:34:12,610
but we want to know

1160
01:34:12,713 --> 01:34:13,839
which are
the ten commandments

1161
01:34:13,948 --> 01:34:14,846
of the unfaithful woman.

1162
01:34:14,949 --> 01:34:17,440
Well, the ten commandments
are easy.

1163
01:34:17,985 --> 01:34:21,443
There are attitudes
that women have

1164
01:34:21,555 --> 01:34:23,750
that give them away,
For example

1165
01:34:23,858 --> 01:34:26,486
lock themselves up
for hours in the bathroom

1166
01:34:26,594 --> 01:34:27,993
to talk on the phone...

1167
01:34:28,663 --> 01:34:32,622
Or go too many times
to the gym

1168
01:34:32,733 --> 01:34:35,395
as she were getting
ready for the Olympic Games.

1169
01:34:35,503 --> 01:34:39,132
Yes, and also have a
cell phone with a contract

1170
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:40,366
and a cell with card

1171
01:34:40,474 --> 01:34:42,066
because the one with card

1172
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:44,110
you don't get the bill
at the end of the month

1173
01:34:44,211 --> 01:34:46,145
stating the calls
that were made.

1174
01:34:46,247 --> 01:34:48,943
There is this one

1175
01:34:49,050 --> 01:34:52,247
which is the essence
of this expression

1176
01:34:52,353 --> 01:34:54,253
of the unfaithful behavior

1177
01:34:54,388 --> 01:34:59,427
which is the waxing
between the legs

1178
01:35:02,022 --> 01:35:03,023
Of course.

1179
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:04,156
Everything that they say

1180
01:35:04,265 --> 01:35:06,000
that is like
the maximum symptoms

1181
01:35:06,001 --> 01:35:07,001
of an unfaithful woman

1182
01:35:07,002 --> 01:35:09,469
I think are symptoms
of an independent woman

1183
01:35:09,570 --> 01:35:12,061
that likes to look gorgeous.

1184
01:35:12,206 --> 01:35:13,798
That is an unfaithful woman.

1185
01:35:14,608 --> 01:35:16,508
Oh, so gorgeous
and independent women

1186
01:35:16,610 --> 01:35:17,474
are all unfaithful?

1187
01:35:17,578 --> 01:35:19,273
I haven't said that.
We are talking about symptoms.

1188
01:35:19,413 --> 01:35:20,710
Yes.
Symptoms.

1189
01:35:20,848 --> 01:35:24,682
I agree, but
looking good and infidelity

1190
01:35:24,785 --> 01:35:26,946
...I agree with the lady.
But they are associated.

1191
01:35:27,088 --> 01:35:28,680
Sometimes.
That is what you're saying.

1192
01:35:28,789 --> 01:35:29,813
No, no,
sometimes, sometimes.

1193
01:35:29,924 --> 01:35:32,392
We have proven,
for example that in the hairdresser

1194
01:35:32,493 --> 01:35:35,155
a high percentage of the
women that go every day...

1195
01:35:35,262 --> 01:35:36,854
it's for a reason.
It's for a reason

1196
01:35:36,964 --> 01:35:38,659
9 out of 10.
There is a suspicion.

1197
01:35:38,799 --> 01:35:40,790
There is a suspicion So then
if your wife is good looking

1198
01:35:40,901 --> 01:35:43,768
you have to suspect
she's unfaithful.

1199
01:35:43,871 --> 01:35:46,101
No, but if she locks herself
up in the bathroom

1200
01:35:46,207 --> 01:35:48,198
to talk for hours,
she probably is.

1201
01:35:48,309 --> 01:35:49,367
She can do the same
from the family room...

1202
01:35:49,477 --> 01:35:51,775
But locked, hours
and hours in the bathroom...

1203
01:35:51,912 --> 01:35:55,481
It seems the debate has started

1204
01:35:55,516 --> 01:35:57,381
...we are going to commercials now...

1205
01:35:57,485 --> 01:35:58,918
When we get back we'll...

1206
01:36:03,858 --> 01:36:10,525
Honey, would you be
unfaithful to me?

1207
01:36:10,631 --> 01:36:16,631
Sweetheart,
how can you say that?

1208
01:36:16,971 --> 01:36:22,971
I don't need another man.
I don't need it.

1209
01:36:29,316 --> 01:36:31,113
I can't hear you.
What are you telling me?

1210
01:36:31,218 --> 01:36:34,312
Ethics! He's talking
to me about ethics!

1211
01:36:34,421 --> 01:36:36,753
Who are you ethical with?
With the one that pays you.

1212
01:36:36,857 --> 01:36:39,485
I'm leaving. No. I don't
want to keep on talking

1213
01:36:39,593 --> 01:36:40,423
with these people.

1214
01:36:40,694 --> 01:36:42,753
I'm so sorry, Mario...
but I have nothing to do here.

1215
01:36:42,863 --> 01:36:45,457
Excuse me. - Eva...
Eva. We haven't finished.

1216
01:36:45,566 --> 01:36:46,533
Who do I give this to?

1217
01:36:47,268 --> 01:36:50,101
You manage...
It's yourjob, Eva.

1218
01:36:50,204 --> 01:36:51,637
No, it's not.

1219
01:36:51,739 --> 01:36:53,502
I'm only being kind I don't
get paid for coming here.

1220
01:36:53,641 --> 01:36:54,573
Bye.

1221
01:36:54,675 --> 01:36:55,869
Where's my purse?

1222
01:36:58,813 --> 01:36:59,780
Take it easy,
we'll start with a video

1223
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:04,317
that has a lot of
shots of the motel...

1224
01:37:13,093 --> 01:37:14,219
Audio.

1225
01:37:14,328 --> 01:37:15,989
Bernardita, please.

1226
01:37:16,096 --> 01:37:17,927
Somebody explain
to me what's going on.

1227
01:37:18,032 --> 01:37:19,090
I don't understand.

1228
01:37:19,233 --> 01:37:45,860
What? No, I'm not
going to do that.

1229
01:37:45,895 --> 01:37:47,293
I can't take this.

1230
01:38:19,326 --> 01:38:28,928
Don't worry my love,

1231
01:38:43,117 --> 01:38:45,677
I'm not going
to smile today.

1232
01:38:48,222 --> 01:38:55,427
I don't have
a reason to do so.

1233
01:38:55,462 --> 01:39:00,092
I hurt many people,
specially the ones I love.

1234
01:39:03,304 --> 01:39:06,239
During a long time

1235
01:39:06,340 --> 01:39:12,340
I lied to myself and I
lied to a lot of people.

1236
01:39:15,149 --> 01:39:17,982
Without thinking
in anybody but myself.

1237
01:39:20,888 --> 01:39:23,914
What I have lived has been

1238
01:39:24,024 --> 01:39:27,516
painful and humiliating

1239
01:39:30,931 --> 01:39:34,025
but it has helped me
to face the truth

1240
01:39:34,134 --> 01:39:38,696
and realize

1241
01:39:40,674 --> 01:39:44,542
that being able
to look in the eyes...

1242
01:39:44,645 --> 01:39:47,739
...freely

1243
01:39:47,848 --> 01:39:51,635
and smile with honesty
does not have price.

1244
01:39:51,670 --> 01:39:55,422
And smile with honesty
does not have price.

1245
01:39:55,457 --> 01:39:58,448
What's your ideal man like?

1246
01:39:59,293 --> 01:40:02,160
First he has to be handsome.

1247
01:40:04,231 --> 01:40:07,394
Sure of himself,

1248
01:40:07,501 --> 01:40:14,771
hot, that pampers me,
cuddly,

1249
01:40:14,875 --> 01:40:17,969
one who spoils me and
asks for nothing in return.

1250
01:40:18,078 --> 01:40:20,672
One that looks at me,
that always knows where I am.

1251
01:40:20,848 --> 01:40:23,180
It's seems a gay man, I think.

1252
01:40:23,283 --> 01:40:25,615
Silly.

1253
01:40:26,687 --> 01:40:30,891
I like a man when he
comes out of the shower.

1254
01:40:30,892 --> 01:40:31,892
Oh, yeah.

1255
01:40:31,893 --> 01:40:35,885
I don't know...
with huge hands...

1256
01:40:35,996 --> 01:40:38,055
Yes. Big hands.
I like that too.

1257
01:40:38,198 --> 01:40:39,893
They make you feel slimmer,
right?

1258
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,091
Yes...

1259
01:40:41,368 --> 01:40:45,395
And very kinky...
very kinky and fun.

1260
01:40:45,506 --> 01:40:48,100
Yes. Yes.
I need a man like that.

1261
01:40:48,275 --> 01:40:51,335
A big man.
A big man.

1262
01:40:51,445 --> 01:40:54,972
Yeah, yeah... with a big one.

1263
01:40:56,984 --> 01:41:00,044
I brought something for you...
A present.

1264
01:41:01,255 --> 01:41:04,224
You're crazy!

1265
01:41:04,324 --> 01:41:06,019
We are going to go
look for some real ones.

1266
01:41:58,045 --> 01:41:58,875
And it says...
