1
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:04,041
<i>My grandma says two things in this world</i>
<i>will always lack flavor:</i>

2
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:07,375
<i>meals without pickles,</i>
<i>and life without love.</i>

3
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:12,041
<i>Pickles, I make sure to carry enough,</i>
<i>when coming back to America from Punjab,</i>

4
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:14,250
<i>so that I can relish them</i>
<i>on pizza and burgers.</i>

5
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,458
<i>I've quite a few memories</i>
<i>attached to them.</i>

6
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,541
<i>This is something</i>
<i>I've learnt from my grandma.</i>

7
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:21,791
<i>Always cherish the memories</i>
<i>of the things you love.</i>

8
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:24,375
<i>Treasure these memories in your heart.</i>

9
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,208
<i>It's been decades since she left Lahore,</i>

10
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:32,375
<i>but the smallest of things remind her</i>
<i>of its lanes, neighborhood and her house.</i>

11
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,625
<i>And when the memories</i>
<i>of her house come to life,</i>

12
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:39,125
<i>so does the fragrance of its soil</i>
<i>and the taste of its delicacies.</i>

13
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,958
<i>I understood her idea about the pickles</i>
<i>as soon as I moved to America,</i>

14
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,500
<i>but her idea about love,</i>

15
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,916
<i>it'll take me some time</i>
<i>to figure that out.</i>

16
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,041
I'm really sorry.

17
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:56,666
I don't want your apology.
This is your responsibility.

18
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,583
I'm sorry, sir.

19
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:01,416
-We'll be careful next time.
-Of what? What is left?

20
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,541
You have already managed
to lose my dog,

21
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,833
and break my father's cinerary urn.

22
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:08,458
What you need to be careful about
is your partner.

23
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:11,458
Your company is called Gentle,
but it's filled with fools.

24
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:14,041
-Sorry.
-Nothing can beat old music, Auntie.

25
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,125
Old music lasts forever.

26
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,250
Like Rahman Sir… No, he is not that old.

27
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:21,583
Like Rafi Sir.
Sardar too loves listening to his songs.

28
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:22,750
Careful.

29
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,416
Oh, ho!

30
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,041
Safe and sound.

31
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,583
-Don't worry.
-Safe.

32
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:31,166
We'll check the sound as well.

33
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:36,208
This music box is my mom's life.

34
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:43,625
Beautiful.

35
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,833
It's working.

36
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:50,416
Brother, this must have
reminded you of your father.

37
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,750
Really?

38
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:55,875
Let's get back to work.

39
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,333
What's going on?

40
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:04,250
Sorry.

41
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,208
Oh, no!

42
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,375
Oh, no!

43
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:16,833
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

44
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:19,083
All okay? You are okay? All good?

45
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:26,875
Oh, ho!

46
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,583
How is it my fault?
Don't get emotional. Forget it.

47
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:33,000
Amreek, listen to me.
Don't walk away. Listen.

48
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,958
She had fond memories
attached to that music box.

49
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,250
Why attach memories
to materialistic things?

50
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,541
They'll eventually break.
Drop it. It's not my fault.

51
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:43,166
-Let's watch the match.
-It's never your fault.

52
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,541
-Right.
-You lose his dog,

53
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,250
you break the cinerary urn,

54
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:51,333
then you say,
"Oh, ho, how is it my fault?"

55
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,500
You tear the books
and say, "We'll fix them."

56
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,916
You make a mess and say,
"We'll make it spic and span."

57
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,458
Amreek, you pack a fish
and a cat together!

58
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:03,541
-To help them bond.
-I just don't understand your talent.

59
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,625
How… How do you manage to do this?
Please tell me.

60
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:08,791
-How do you manage to do this, huh?
-What?

61
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:12,083
You can never prepare a grocery list,
but when it comes to my faults,

62
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,083
you always have a list ready.

63
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:17,125
Do I point out your faults?
You aren't perfect. I don't say anything.

64
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,500
You can't apologize
so you start accusing me.

65
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:20,916
You keep making up things.

66
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,083
-Do you want me to list your faults?
-Yes, please. Yeah?

67
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:27,333
"Amreek, when you come,
please leave your shoes outside."

68
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,166
"Wear these other shoes and go inside."

69
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,291
I am entering my own house and not a gym!
And… This!

70
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,416
"Please eat fruits. It is very healthy."

71
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,250
-So?
-I am a man, not a monkey!

72
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,000
And this, your favorite!

73
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,416
"These magnets
should be perpendicular to the ground."

74
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,541
Don't touch them.

75
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:44,375
Will the refrigerator stop cooling
if the magnets are moved?

76
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,583
-Look, does it stop if I move…
-Don't…

77
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:59,041
You only know how to break things, Amreek.

78
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,541
You could just never fix them.

79
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:06,041
Radha! Drop it. I won't do it next time.
Please just drop it.

80
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,708
I'm done with your next time.

81
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:11,000
-What do you mean?
-Done means you and I are over.

82
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,958
Who will take care of Gently Gently?

83
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,250
I mean, who will take care of me?

84
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:23,000
-I was just joking.
-I don't believe you just said that.

85
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:26,166
Do you care about anything
other than the company, huh?

86
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,750
Me or anything else for that matter?

87
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,083
You have nothing to do
with anyone's emotions.

88
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,500
Yes, I don't get emotions. Should I leave?

89
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,750
This is the problem, Amreek.

90
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:41,166
Whenever we discuss this,
you start saying,

91
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,666
"I should leave. I should run away."

92
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,375
Actually, it's my mistake.
I have expectations from the wrong guy.

93
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,750
How can someone
who cannot face his family ever face me?

94
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:54,333
I don't want to face anyone!
Neither my family nor you!

95
00:06:58,625 --> 00:06:59,875
This is who I am!

96
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,333
I am like this only.

97
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,166
Take it or leave it.

98
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:09,958
Okay?

99
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:51,833
{\an8}<i>This separation</i>

100
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:55,291
{\an8}<i>I can endure you being away from me</i>

101
00:07:55,375 --> 00:08:02,375
{\an8}<i>I cannot tolerate</i>
<i>You being upset with me</i>

102
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,458
<i>My love</i>

103
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:06,750
No…

104
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:10,208
<i>Listen to what the eyes express</i>

105
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,750
<i>My love</i>

106
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:16,958
<i>Forever in my heart</i>
<i>I want you to stay…</i>

107
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,208
Would Goldie and you
like to go on a date with me?

108
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:31,416
{\an8}<i>Without you, I cannot survive</i>

109
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,958
{\an8}<i>I am surely going to die</i>

110
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:40,583
{\an8}<i>When you get upset with me, I shatter</i>

111
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:43,875
<i>Don't ever break my heart</i>

112
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:47,208
<i>Don't ever leave me</i>

113
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:54,083
<i>My love, please don't ever break my heart</i>

114
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:57,416
{\an8}<i>Don't ever break my heart</i>

115
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,708
{\an8}<i>Don't ever leave me</i>

116
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:07,750
{\an8}<i>My love</i>
<i>Please don't ever break my heart…</i>

117
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,416
-Radha?
-Yes?

118
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,166
You want to be my partner?

119
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,791
-Gently, Gently.
-Cheers.

120
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:28,000
{\an8}<i>Just tell me</i>
<i>Why do you love me so much?</i>

121
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:35,083
{\an8}<i>I'm not an angel</i>
<i>The world laughs at my fate</i>

122
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:39,041
{\an8}<i>You don't know what you mean to me</i>

123
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:42,375
<i>You own my body and soul</i>

124
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:47,958
{\an8}<i>If you leave, I too will cease to exist</i>

125
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:51,166
{\an8}<i>Don't ever break my heart</i>

126
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,708
{\an8}<i>Don't ever leave me</i>

127
00:09:54,791 --> 00:10:01,666
{\an8}<i>My love, please don't ever break my heart</i>

128
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,916
<i>Don't ever break my heart</i>

129
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,208
<i>Don't ever leave me</i>

130
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:15,208
<i>My love</i>
<i>Please don't ever break my heart…</i>

131
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,500
Radha…

132
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,166
this isn't the first time we have fought.

133
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,041
You also overstepped.

134
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,916
You dragged my family into this.
Did you really have to?

135
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,250
I mean, I know I was wrong.

136
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,291
I accept it was my fault.

137
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,875
But who can understand me
better than you, huh?

138
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,083
No one.

139
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,375
You know, I said it
on the spur of the moment…

140
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:19,916
Hi.

141
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,708
Kiddo, Sardar
has taken a turn for the worse.

142
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,958
There's more.
She is insisting on going to Lahore.

143
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:31,625
Tell me, how can someone who can barely
make it to the bathroom on her own,

144
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:32,750
travel to Lahore?

145
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,000
<i>This is just absurd.</i>

146
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:37,083
She doesn't listen to anyone
other than you.

147
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:41,250
That's why I want you here
as soon as possible. Got it?

148
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:42,958
Yes.

149
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,208
And why do you look like a forlorn lover?

150
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:49,000
<i>Better clean up your act</i>
<i>before you come home.</i>

151
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:49,916
<i>Got it?</i>

152
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:52,708
-Bye.
-Bye.

153
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:03,208
Radha…

154
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:31,333
Why don't you go on a diet, huh?

155
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,250
What are you doing, Sardar?

156
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:36,000
-You eat all day.
-Jogi, take him away.

157
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,083
Sorry, doctor.

158
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,125
This is the limit, Sardar.

159
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:43,708
-Go. Get down, boy. Go, boy.
-You've turned a hospital into a park.

160
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,208
How many doctors were there?

161
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:50,541
Three, Sardar.

162
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,208
And just one tumor.

163
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:55,375
Yet they couldn't manage
to get it out of my body.

164
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:56,666
Shame on those assholes!

165
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:01,791
-Sardar, they can at least try.
-Rubbish!

166
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:05,250
Trying isn't good enough.
It doesn't guarantee results.

167
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:08,958
Doctor, let's go outside and talk.
Please come with me.

168
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,583
Where are you going? Ponty!

169
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,000
What are you conspiring against me?

170
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,125
So what has he smuggled in?

171
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:28,250
Coffee?

172
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,166
What!

173
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:33,833
At least smuggle in something
worth the effort.

174
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,416
Dimwits.

175
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,666
Look, we have already
tried radiation on the tumor.

176
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:44,916
I don't think she can take
any other surgery at this frail age.

177
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,000
She may be young at heart,
but the fact is that she's 90 years old.

178
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:52,291
So, Dr. Ponty, what will be our next step?

179
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,041
So what I suggest is, you take her home

180
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,458
and make her
as comfortable as you can. Please.

181
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:58,875
Gurki.

182
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,291
What are you two gossiping about?

183
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,166
Gurkeerat, come here.

184
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,083
What happened?

185
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,166
He's shouting
without sharing anything useful.

186
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,833
{\an8}<i>How will the new 2,000 rupee note look?</i>

187
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:15,958
Stop worrying about others
and start looking after yourself.

188
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:18,666
What did the three monkeys say?

189
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:23,833
They said that you are
absolutely fit and fine.

190
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:28,833
Oh, I'd make them a part of my will
had they said that in front of me.

191
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:33,500
Come on, how many people
do you plan to add to your will?

192
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,750
Tell me, what do we do
with this tumor of mine?

193
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:42,000
Tumor… Well…

194
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,208
Speak up.

195
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:47,208
Take these pills
and the tumor will disappear.

196
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,791
-Really?
-Yes.

197
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,416
-Let's go then.
-Oh, ho! What are you doing?

198
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,333
You just said I am fit and fine.
It's all good.

199
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,166
Then let's go to Lahore.

200
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,708
Like there is a cab outside
you can hop in and reach Lahore.

201
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:02,833
We'll plan it
after you get discharged tomorrow.

202
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:08,250
You know who's coming here
to meet you tomorrow?

203
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,416
-Bhajji?
-No.

204
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,666
Amreek.

205
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,625
Oh, Amreek from America.

206
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:19,500
-Yes.
-He finally starts missing his grandma?

207
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,750
Hey, am I going to kick the bucket?

208
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:27,833
What do you mean?

209
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,125
Am I going to die soon?

210
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,958
What are you saying?
Don't say such things.

211
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:40,083
Okay, make a call to Amreek.

212
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,750
How many single malt were they?

213
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,083
Around 12, Sardar.

214
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,583
-How many do you plan to get?
<i>-Two.</i>

215
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,416
Shame on you, son of a gun!

216
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,625
Hey, you are cursing your own child.

217
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:06,583
Forget that
and tell me what's with this sad face?

218
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,291
Let's talk once I get there.

219
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,666
You aren't going anywhere.
Stay home and rest.

220
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,791
<i>Hey, I am going to Lahore.</i>
<i>Didn't your dad tell you that?</i>

221
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:19,333
What? Are you crazy?
Who goes on a world tour at this age?

222
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:22,875
-Just stay home and rest. Got it?
-That's what I told her.

223
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:25,291
<i>Age be damned.</i>

224
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:29,291
<i>Tell me, why this sad face?</i>

225
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,041
Bye, see you soon.

226
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,875
Huh? Oye! Oye!

227
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,583
Oye! He disconnected the call.

228
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,375
What do I tell them?

229
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:47,791
Taxi, sir?

230
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:48,833
Sir, taxi?

231
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,166
Taxi, ma'am, taxi? Taxi, ma'am?

232
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,625
{\an8}Taxi? Taxi, sir?

233
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:57,625
Taxi?

234
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,166
Sir, taxi? Taxi, sir?

235
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,625
No, my family is picking me up.

236
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:05,208
There's a lot of traffic. You'll be home
before your family gets here.

237
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,208
My family's picking me up, thank you.

238
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,458
-Sir, taxi?
-Okay, sir. As you wish.

239
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:11,166
Taxi, sir?

240
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,875
Will there be traffic on the way home?

241
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,125
Don't worry, sir, just get in.

242
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,916
Stop, stop!

243
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,416
Joginder!

244
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,083
Damn.

245
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,875
What a welcome!

246
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:18,041
Amreek, you are the first person

247
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,875
to enter his own house like, a thief!

248
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,666
Stop! Stay!

249
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,541
-He bit me.
-Amreek, my child!

250
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:32,958
This dog is crazy.

251
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:35,125
Get him to stop. Take him away.

252
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,125
Don't break the bottles
in the duty free bag.

253
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,541
He won't stop barking. Stop barking!

254
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,666
Kiddo. Take him away.

255
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,833
How are you, kiddo?

256
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:45,250
How do you think?
Is that dog crazy? He bit me!

257
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,958
-Why are you late?
-I'm not. No one came to receive me.

258
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,375
Talk to your dad about it.

259
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:52,125
Didn't I ask you to send a car for him?
What happened?

260
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,708
Lovely <i>bhaiya</i> took that car with him.

261
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:55,625
-Lovely?
-Hey!

262
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,333
So what's the big deal?
It's not like he sold it.

263
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,083
He took it as he had a meeting.

264
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:04,083
Mom messaged on the way,
"Since you are there, could you please…"

265
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,916
-It's my fault that I asked you.
-How is it my fault?

266
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,750
-You're never at fault.
-What have I done?

267
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,500
Careful there.

268
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,083
This is my wheelchair,
not a video game remote.

269
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,291
You should look after me.

270
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,250
Please me
and I'll make you a part of my will.

271
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,208
Then you'll never have to work again.

272
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:23,666
-How many times will you say that?
-Hello, Sardar Kaur from Lahore.

273
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,875
Hey, Amreek from America!

274
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,041
Come, give me a hug.

275
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:32,333
Sit.

276
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:39,750
Now will you tell me,
what's with this sad face?

277
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,708
My fiancée is now my ex.

278
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:50,291
So you are miserable
because she has become your ex,

279
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:54,541
or has she become your ex
because she had made you miserable?

280
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,375
Tell me.

281
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:09,541
What happened, kiddo? What is wrong?

282
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,458
Amreek?

283
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,291
Stop crying, my boy. Come here.

284
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,166
It's okay. Stop crying.

285
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,125
Your dog bit me.

286
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,916
It's okay. Stop crying.

287
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,666
You were expecting
a miracle from your son, huh?

288
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,750
How can someone
who cannot control himself control Sardar?

289
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,750
Give him some time.
I am sure he has something on his mind.

290
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,333
He has lost his mind
after going to America.

291
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:43,916
Ever since Sardar dropped him
from the dining table when he was little,

292
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,958
he starts crying for no reason at all.

293
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,833
Our son's not crazy.

294
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:50,833
Wouldn't you cry if I pushed you down
from the dining table?

295
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,041
Why would you push me?

296
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:56,666
Look at this.

297
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,166
Already changing everything to your name?

298
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,041
Act your age, don't act smart.

299
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,916
Tell me, how is the design?

300
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,833
Design is fine, but the name is wrong.

301
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,750
-It should be Amreek.
-Why?

302
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,583
He's Sardar's favorite.

303
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:17,291
Champion Cycles' owner.
He is back, brother.

304
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,666
But Sardar promised
that she'd make me its CEO.

305
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,833
Yes, of course.

306
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:25,333
Like she has fulfilled
all the promises she has made so far.

307
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:26,500
Pinky!

308
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,625
Why did he have to come back?

309
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:33,625
Why couldn't he keep running
his company Mentally Mentally?

310
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:34,625
Gently Gently.

311
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,541
Gently, mentally, what-every.

312
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:40,416
Lovely was doing such a good job
handling the company.

313
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,833
I'm sure Gurki felt threatened.
He asked Amreek to come back.

314
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:46,750
He feared Sardar
might transfer everything to Lovely.

315
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:50,000
<i>But the hopes of millions of Indians…</i>

316
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:51,375
What's this "hmm"?

317
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:54,750
I am not telling you a story!
You are always glued to the television.

318
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:57,458
-I say something, you say "hmm."
-What are you doing?

319
00:21:57,541 --> 00:22:00,458
No one here takes any responsibility
while I keep worrying.

320
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:02,500
-Good night, Simi.
-Good night!

321
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:10,041
Honey and your step-brother
were talking about Amreek.

322
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:14,416
Why does it matter? He's still
my brother from the same mother.

323
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,291
Yes, you two have the same mother,

324
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:20,625
but it was your father who started
the Cycle Company in Lahore.

325
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:24,666
But it is Gubji's father
who helped the company grow.

326
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:30,500
Planting the sapling is important,
but watering it is equally important.

327
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,333
So you are siding with Lovely now.

328
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:35,750
See for yourself. Lovely is doing
a good job running the company.

329
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:39,208
Our company would've shut down
if we'd followed Amreek's ideas.

330
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:44,666
Even Einstein would have been a nobody
had no one believed in his ideas.

331
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:48,500
You mean
we have given birth to an Einstein?

332
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:51,625
I don't know,
but his ideas were mind-blowing.

333
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:54,500
-It's just that no one trusted him.
-Of course, he is Newton.

334
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:58,041
-Didn't end up with the right family.
-You have to have the final say.

335
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:02,875
Anyway, it's good
that our son is back at the right time.

336
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,000
If he stays in her good books,

337
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:07,416
Sardar will surely make him
a part of her will.

338
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:12,041
Why are you staring at me?

339
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:15,291
There's no use being practical with you.

340
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:50,916
<i>That's Sardar for you</i>

341
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,291
<i>Always a menace</i>

342
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:55,958
<i>Causes trouble</i>

343
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:58,041
<i>Then making a run for it…</i>

344
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:38,125
-Come and have your milk.
-Get today's newspaper.

345
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:40,416
You know he wants you
to make the morning tea.

346
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,208
Where's my blazer, Mom?

347
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:43,541
-Son!
-Did anyone iron it?

348
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:45,791
Someone get me butter with these parathas.

349
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:11,500
<i>Excellent</i>

350
00:25:11,583 --> 00:25:14,125
<i>Everyone loves it</i>

351
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:16,875
<i>Nowhere to run-run, nowhere to hide</i>

352
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:18,833
<i>Unique and different is my vibe</i>

353
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:21,958
<i>Fill your heart and your soul with love</i>
<i>Divinity fuels the light within</i>

354
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:24,625
<i>Give it 100%</i>
<i>And take it upon yourself to win</i>

355
00:25:24,708 --> 00:25:25,833
<i>Excellent</i>

356
00:25:25,916 --> 00:25:27,125
<i>Chasing the horizon</i>

357
00:25:27,208 --> 00:25:28,208
<i>Excellent</i>

358
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:29,666
<i>Going for the dream</i>

359
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,958
<i>Excellent</i>

360
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:32,166
<i>Blessings all around</i>

361
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,750
<i>Excellent</i>

362
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:36,041
<i>Excellent</i>

363
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:37,416
<i>Chasing the horizon</i>

364
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,583
<i>Excellent</i>

365
00:25:38,666 --> 00:25:40,041
<i>Going for the dream</i>

366
00:25:40,125 --> 00:25:41,541
<i>Excellent</i>

367
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:42,583

00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:46,750
<i>Excellent</i>

371
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:49,416
<i>Excellent</i>

372
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:22,083
<i>I saw.</i>

373
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:24,833
They are relaunching the hi-end cycle.

374
00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:27,291
Whose idea was it?

375
00:26:27,791 --> 00:26:29,958
-Bubbly worked hard.
-Not Bubbly, Lovely.

376
00:26:30,041 --> 00:26:31,625
Whatever.

377
00:26:32,583 --> 00:26:37,375
Your idea was good,
but your timing wasn't.

378
00:26:37,458 --> 00:26:40,250
If you'd given me some time,
the timing would've worked out.

379
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:43,250
What do you keep saying?
You dropped me from the dining table,

380
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:44,458
so I am a little idiotic?

381
00:26:44,541 --> 00:26:48,125
I have to say, son,
you are just like the rest.

382
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,666
Everyone knows that I'll soon be gone,

383
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:54,083
so they keep coming to me
with their sob stories.

384
00:26:54,666 --> 00:26:56,250
Stop the melodrama, Sardar.

385
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:59,125
God will reject your request.
He doesn't want a headache.

386
00:26:59,208 --> 00:27:02,000
What request will He cancel
when I didn't send Him any?

387
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:04,208
Come here.

388
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,208
Come on.

389
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,750
I said come here.

390
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,125
Take me to Lahore.

391
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,625
You'll have my word.

392
00:27:17,708 --> 00:27:20,500
I'll make you
the Champion of Champion Cycles.

393
00:27:21,833 --> 00:27:22,958
I have your word?

394
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:31,416
Sardar Kaur from Lahore…

395
00:27:32,291 --> 00:27:34,208
What is it that you seek in Lahore?

396
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:39,583
When this country was divided,

397
00:27:41,916 --> 00:27:44,458
a part of my soul remained there.

398
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,041
I have a house there,

399
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:55,041
which I had built with your grandfather.

400
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,791
I want to go to that house.

401
00:28:00,083 --> 00:28:01,916
Old age does make people go bonkers.

402
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,791
What about you?
You've gone bonkers at such a young age.

403
00:28:05,416 --> 00:28:07,250
I've been deranged since childhood,

404
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:10,291
ever since you dropped me
from the dining table.

405
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:14,750
Sardar, your cold coffee.

406
00:28:32,666 --> 00:28:33,666
This is it.

407
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,833
Our raddled home.

408
00:28:36,791 --> 00:28:40,625
You could have just called it our abode.
Why did you have to call it raddled?

409
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:43,916
Birds build their homes
one twig at a time.

410
00:28:45,166 --> 00:28:46,791
We too will build ourselves one.

411
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:53,375
Is this the imported liquor you stole?

412
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:55,500
Yes, it is.

413
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:58,375
Try it. Cheers.

414
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:02,875
Perfect.

415
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:09,291
A small effort by me, for our abode.

416
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:10,708
This…

417
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:14,166
If not used for our home,
of what use are they to me?

418
00:29:41,833 --> 00:29:44,541
<i>I want to belong to you</i>

419
00:29:44,625 --> 00:29:47,250
<i>I am all yours, my love</i>

420
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:50,125
<i>I don't seek the stars or the moon</i>

421
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:52,541
<i>I just want my love</i>

422
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:55,583
<i>Wherever he resides</i>
<i>Will be the home of mine</i>

423
00:29:55,666 --> 00:29:58,333
<i>I'll endure everything with a smile</i>

424
00:29:58,416 --> 00:30:01,125
<i>Wherever he resides</i>
<i>Will be the home of mine</i>

425
00:30:01,208 --> 00:30:04,333
<i>I'll endure everything with a smile</i>

426
00:30:04,416 --> 00:30:08,791
<i>I want your word, my love…</i>

427
00:30:09,458 --> 00:30:13,791
<i>I belong to you</i>

428
00:30:14,958 --> 00:30:19,208
<i>Don't you ever leave me</i>

429
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:23,041
<i>I belong to you</i>

430
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:26,000
<i>Don't you ever leave me</i>

431
00:30:26,083 --> 00:30:31,375
<i>Don't let our love fall weak…</i>

432
00:30:31,458 --> 00:30:35,625
<i>I belong to you</i>

433
00:30:37,541 --> 00:30:41,500
<i>Don't you ever leave me…</i>

434
00:30:42,416 --> 00:30:44,166
-Higher, higher.
-Okay.

435
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,750
That side. Over there, over there.

436
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:46,791
A little lower.

437
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:50,958
Is it okay now?

438
00:30:52,041 --> 00:30:53,333
Oh, ho!

439
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:18,458
<i>I belong to you</i>

440
00:31:18,541 --> 00:31:20,708
<i>Don't you ever leave me</i>

441
00:31:20,791 --> 00:31:22,291
Can you bring it closer?

442
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:24,000
<i>I belong to you</i>

443
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:26,875
<i>Don't you ever leave me</i>

444
00:31:34,458 --> 00:31:37,791
You still love
having cold coffee in winter…

445
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:44,708
Fine.

446
00:31:46,041 --> 00:31:47,166
Don't get emotional.

447
00:31:48,416 --> 00:31:49,416
I'll go with you.

448
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,916
{\an8}-It's not easy to get a visa for Pakistan.
-Okay.

449
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,708
But you'll get the approval
because of your green card.

450
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:03,958
Thank you, sir. My grandmother
doesn't have a green card.

451
00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:05,458
I hope it won't be an issue.

452
00:32:05,541 --> 00:32:07,375
-We'll see what can be done.
-Okay.

453
00:32:21,416 --> 00:32:23,583
-Impossible.
-Impossible?

454
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:25,625
Why, sir?

455
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:27,000
Because your grandmother is…

456
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:28,000
Blacklisted.

457
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:32,791
Sardar is a YouTube viral star.

458
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:36,708
<i>Today, during India-Pakistan's</i>

459
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:39,000

<i>Bhajji, you monkey!</i>

462
00:32:44,958 --> 00:32:47,000
<i>She pulled his beard</i>

463
00:32:47,083 --> 00:32:49,500

<i>You're a monkey!</i>

464
00:32:49,583 --> 00:32:52,375
<i>She claims that</i>

465
00:32:52,458 --> 00:32:54,000

<i>…addressed India's bowler Harbhajan</i>

467
00:32:56,916 --> 00:32:57,791
You are laughing?

468
00:32:59,458 --> 00:33:03,500
You have an anti-national status
in Pakistan because of that guy.

469
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:05,041
Congratulations.

470
00:33:05,625 --> 00:33:08,875
Oye! He called my Bhajji a monkey.

471
00:33:08,958 --> 00:33:11,166
-So you broke a bottle on his head?
-Yes.

472
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:15,041
You know the problem is, you only know
how to break things, not fix things…

473
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:22,833
What's wrong with him? Huh?

474
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,250
Amreek,

475
00:33:32,291 --> 00:33:36,250
the news reporters claim the world
is going to end in two years.

476
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:38,041
Then go and save it.

477
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:39,791
Like I care.

478
00:33:39,875 --> 00:33:42,333
I'll be dead in a few years anyway.

479
00:33:42,416 --> 00:33:45,625
You cannot sleep at night
because of these weird dreams of yours.

480
00:33:46,875 --> 00:33:50,541
Then why don't you tell me a story
and help me sleep?

481
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:53,416
The story of your break up.

482
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:56,666
My break up story is not a bedtime story.

483
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:00,416
Fine, then crack open a bottle a whiskey.

484
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:04,583
Hurry up.

485
00:34:04,666 --> 00:34:05,791
Be patient.

486
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:17,083
It's the one Grandpa gave you, isn't it?

487
00:34:17,166 --> 00:34:18,166
No, it's not.

488
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,875
It's imported liquor.
I am sure we'll find it someday.

489
00:34:23,125 --> 00:34:26,666
He stole it from an Englishman.

490
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:31,083
He made you a drink, a large one,
and then proposed to you.

491
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,833
-Right?
-Right.

492
00:34:33,541 --> 00:34:35,083
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

493
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:42,708
Then came the storm
that ruined everything,

494
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:46,708
and I ended up spending
the rest of my life in his memories.

495
00:34:46,791 --> 00:34:50,541
Long live Pakistan! Long live Pakistan!

496
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:52,041
Break the doors!

497
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:53,833
No one should escape!

498
00:34:54,833 --> 00:34:56,583
Get everyone!

499
00:34:56,666 --> 00:34:59,666
No infidel's house should survive.

500
00:35:00,416 --> 00:35:03,291
Gursher Singhji,
this house is our symbol of love.

501
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,291
It is our Taj Mahal.

502
00:35:08,208 --> 00:35:10,916
I had a dream
when we laid down its foundation.

503
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:16,291
We'd always stay here
with our three children.

504
00:35:18,041 --> 00:35:20,750
-This house is small for three kids.
-No, it isn't.

505
00:35:21,666 --> 00:35:25,666
After some time, we'll buy
the surrounding land and expand our house.

506
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:30,875
Then this entire lane will be known
as the Champion Cycles owner's lane.

507
00:35:31,416 --> 00:35:34,958
Then our kids and their kids too…

508
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:38,458
will have their homes in this lane.

509
00:35:39,375 --> 00:35:42,708
We both will relax
and lounge here on our chairs,

510
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:44,541
under the moonlight.

511
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:46,875
-Really? Then?
-Then what?

512
00:35:47,833 --> 00:35:49,041
Our story will end.

513
00:35:52,708 --> 00:35:54,291
Don't you dare die before I do.

514
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:57,708
Otherwise,
there'd be no one to worry about me.

515
00:35:58,666 --> 00:35:59,708
I promise.

516
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:03,666
When the time comes,
we both will leave together.

517
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:06,666
Then you too have my word.

518
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:11,916
You will have to keep your word, mister.

519
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:15,041
If we leave this country,

520
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:17,958
you'll have to carry the house along,
on your head.

521
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:19,750
I will, I certainly will.

522
00:36:25,708 --> 00:36:29,791
Junior too likes that thought, Gursherji.

523
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:32,291
Destroy their homes!

524
00:36:32,375 --> 00:36:34,666
Not a single house of theirs
should remain standing.

525
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,166
<i>Live long Pakistan!</i>

526
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:39,166
It is so difficult
when someone comes to you and says,

527
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:43,875
that your house is no longer your own.
Your country is no longer your own.

528
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:48,708
Fine.

529
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,166
Even if we manage to get there, Sardar,

530
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:55,958
everything must have changed by now.

531
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:58,666
The lanes and the neighborhoods
won't be the same.

532
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,500
Your home
and the people you knew won't be there.

533
00:37:01,583 --> 00:37:03,291
My home will still be there, son.

534
00:37:04,916 --> 00:37:06,541
Nothing will have changed there.

535
00:37:11,541 --> 00:37:14,291
That home is filled with memories.

536
00:37:16,708 --> 00:37:19,041
The paint on its walls perhaps has faded,

537
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:22,625
but the memories surrounding them
are too strong to fade.

538
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:28,791
I had graced it with love.

539
00:37:33,166 --> 00:37:36,333
Just like you two
graced Gently Gently with your love.

540
00:37:38,333 --> 00:37:39,458
No.

541
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:43,125
Come on now, show me a picture of her.

542
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:45,291
Come on, Sardar.

543
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:54,291
How can I expect you to like it here
when you've left your heart there?

544
00:37:56,833 --> 00:37:58,166
You are missing her?

545
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:02,083
I never stopped thinking about her.

546
00:38:05,958 --> 00:38:07,541
I can understand.

547
00:38:10,958 --> 00:38:16,708
I never stop thinking
about Gursher Singhji either.

548
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:29,000
You mean you have been feeling like I do…

549
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:34,750
for the past 70 years?

550
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:41,083
When Gursher Singhji left this world,

551
00:38:43,833 --> 00:38:48,541
a part of me left with him too.

552
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:55,916
I have been feeling his void nonstop…

553
00:38:57,916 --> 00:39:00,958
for the past 70 years.

554
00:39:05,333 --> 00:39:11,791
That's why I wanted
to go back home and fill that void.

555
00:39:17,791 --> 00:39:20,875
Before I breathe my last breath,

556
00:39:23,041 --> 00:39:27,625
I want to sit next to it…

557
00:39:29,416 --> 00:39:31,958
and fill the void.

558
00:39:32,583 --> 00:39:33,791
That's all.

559
00:39:38,875 --> 00:39:40,166
Joginder.

560
00:39:40,916 --> 00:39:42,833
-Yes.
-Let's go.

561
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:25,916
How about a road trip…

562
00:40:27,541 --> 00:40:28,916
from Amritsar to Lahore?

563
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:31,583
Really?

564
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:34,000
You'll take me there?

565
00:40:35,416 --> 00:40:38,416
Come hell or high water,

566
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:43,708
I'll help you fill the void, Sardar.

567
00:40:45,875 --> 00:40:46,958
Promise.

568
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,833
Thank you.

569
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:53,541
{\an8}Some official made a mistake.

570
00:40:53,625 --> 00:40:56,333
{\an8}It's not like it's written by God
that it cannot be changed.

571
00:40:56,416 --> 00:41:00,458
{\an8}Sorry, sir, I cannot offer you
anything other than my apology.

572
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:04,000
I have come here with a lot of hope, sir.
Please do something about it.

573
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:07,625
-You don't get it.
-No, you don't get it.

574
00:41:07,708 --> 00:41:09,041
This is not possible.

575
00:41:14,333 --> 00:41:18,375
Sir, it is my grandma's last wish.

576
00:41:18,875 --> 00:41:21,416
She wants to go to Lahore.

577
00:41:22,375 --> 00:41:24,083
I can understand, but…

578
00:41:24,166 --> 00:41:26,583
No, sir, you do not understand.

579
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:31,291
Listen, give me some time.

580
00:41:31,375 --> 00:41:34,666
She doesn't have the time.
Sir, she doesn't have much time left.

581
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:38,291
Can you give me two days?
Give me just two days.

582
00:41:39,083 --> 00:41:41,250
Give me two days
and I'll see what I can do.

583
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,458
-Thank you, sir. Two days, right?
-You're welcome.

584
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
-Sir…
-Who'd believe that

585
00:41:50,083 --> 00:41:55,791
our 90-year-old Sardar wants to go
to Pakistan for a heart transplant?

586
00:41:55,875 --> 00:41:58,000
Like we don't have hearts or doctors here.

587
00:41:58,416 --> 00:42:01,333
And you don't have any brains.
Stop bothering me. Go study.

588
00:42:01,416 --> 00:42:02,708
Why are you so rude, man?

589
00:42:03,208 --> 00:42:04,416
-Move!
-Hey!

590
00:42:06,708 --> 00:42:09,166
Kids these days.

591
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:12,166
Radha.

592
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:17,208
Chain mail?

593
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,708
Yes? Hello?

594
00:42:24,791 --> 00:42:28,000
Hello, this is Qureshi
from the Pakistan High Commission.

595
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:29,875
Sir! Yes, sir.

596
00:42:30,416 --> 00:42:32,375
I have been waiting for your call, sir.

597
00:42:32,458 --> 00:42:36,583
We had considered your request
on humanitarian grounds.

598
00:42:36,666 --> 00:42:39,083
Thank you, sir. Thank you, thank you.

599
00:42:39,166 --> 00:42:40,833
I said we had considered it.

600
00:42:43,166 --> 00:42:45,333
What do you mean?

601
00:42:45,916 --> 00:42:47,416
Actually…

602
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,541
the high commission has rejected
your grandma's application

603
00:42:50,625 --> 00:42:51,958
because of her hot temper.

604
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,416
Anyway, you can go to Lahore.

605
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:00,333
I can say with certainty that
you'll come back with lots of memories.

606
00:43:00,416 --> 00:43:03,083
We are unable to do anything
about grandma's memories,

607
00:43:03,166 --> 00:43:05,666
but you want her next generation
to come back with memories?

608
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,500
I should go to Lahore
and bring the house back in my pocket.

609
00:43:08,583 --> 00:43:09,916
No one will know, correct?

610
00:43:11,875 --> 00:43:16,583
<i>Today, we are going to talk about someone</i>
<i>who, in a small town in America,</i>

611
00:43:16,791 --> 00:43:21,833
<i>managed to relocate a 100-year-old tree</i>
<i>20 miles away from its original location.</i>

612
00:43:22,416 --> 00:43:25,125
<i>The name of the company</i>
<i>that pulled off this miracle is</i>

613
00:43:25,208 --> 00:43:28,958
<i>Gently Gently Packers and Movers,</i>
<i>which is run by an Indian, Ms. Radha.</i>

614
00:43:29,041 --> 00:43:30,083
<i>Let's talk to her.</i>

615
00:43:30,166 --> 00:43:32,541
<i>Please tell us something</i>
<i>about this amazing feat.</i>

616
00:43:32,625 --> 00:43:33,833
<i>Hi.</i>

617
00:43:33,916 --> 00:43:37,666
<i>This tree that you see is 100 years old.</i>

618
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:40,583
<i>So our team had to move it</i>
<i>quite carefully.</i>

619
00:43:41,166 --> 00:43:44,041
<i>We thought that if in this day and age,</i>

620
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:49,083
<i>one can move big homes</i>
<i>from one place to another,</i>

621
00:43:49,708 --> 00:43:52,500
<i>then why not save a tree</i>
<i>along with its roots?</i>

622
00:43:52,583 --> 00:43:55,541
<i>Roots or foundations of anything old</i>
<i>are often quite strong,</i>

623
00:43:55,625 --> 00:43:59,291
<i>so it's quite easy to move them</i>
<i>once you get a hold on them.</i>

624
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:03,000
<i>I would like to give the credit</i>
<i>of this hard work to my team.</i>

625
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:28,083
Sardar cannot go to her house in Lahore,

626
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,833
but her house in Lahore
can certainly come to her.

627
00:44:33,125 --> 00:44:36,291
It'll no longer be a homecoming,
now the home is coming.

628
00:44:39,916 --> 00:44:44,708
{\an8}An Indian's house in Pakistan
being brought back to India.

629
00:44:44,791 --> 00:44:47,958
It will certainly increase your followers.
By millions.

630
00:44:48,041 --> 00:44:50,125
You should set up a meeting at the least.

631
00:44:51,291 --> 00:44:54,000
Then we lift it,
like relocating a structure.

632
00:44:54,083 --> 00:44:57,083
Take a temple for example.
We lift the temple like this and then…

633
00:44:57,166 --> 00:44:59,625
-Then what do we do?
-What's going on, guys?

634
00:45:00,791 --> 00:45:06,375
Nothing.
I was showing her Netflix on YouTube.

635
00:45:06,458 --> 00:45:08,125
I'll be right back. Bye.

636
00:45:13,833 --> 00:45:16,208
Sir! I just need
to talk to you for two minutes.

637
00:45:16,291 --> 00:45:18,541
I am quite busy.
Why don't you speak to Asif.

638
00:45:18,625 --> 00:45:21,375
-Attend to his queries.
-I want to talk to you, not Asif.

639
00:45:21,458 --> 00:45:22,875
-I'll handle it.
-Sir!

640
00:45:22,958 --> 00:45:24,916
Please, sir!

641
00:45:25,541 --> 00:45:27,791
-I'll pass on your message.
-Just two minutes.

642
00:45:30,875 --> 00:45:34,791
It is difficult to relocate a house,
but it is not impossible.

643
00:45:34,875 --> 00:45:38,083
In technical terms,
it is known as structural relocation.

644
00:45:38,833 --> 00:45:40,125
Take a look, sir.

645
00:45:40,208 --> 00:45:43,916
We support the house with the help
of steel girders to avoid any accidents.

646
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,083
Then we lift it up
with the help of jacks, just like…

647
00:45:47,166 --> 00:45:49,708
Sir, you have a tire?
I mean, you own a car, right?

648
00:45:50,291 --> 00:45:53,833
Just like we lift a car with the help
of a jack to replace a flat tire,

649
00:45:53,916 --> 00:45:57,166
we'll lift the house
with the help of the jacks.

650
00:45:57,250 --> 00:46:02,000
Then we'll slowly shift it on to a truck
so that we can safely transport it.

651
00:46:02,083 --> 00:46:05,500
We wrap it up, pack it, to ensure
that it doesn't move from its place,

652
00:46:05,583 --> 00:46:07,791
and we can take it
from one place to another.

653
00:46:10,666 --> 00:46:12,208
It's a common recurrence, sir.

654
00:46:12,875 --> 00:46:16,916
When redeveloping highways and roads,
this is how we relocate temples.

655
00:46:20,541 --> 00:46:22,916
This team that you see,
I am in touch with them.

656
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:25,375
No, I am in touch with them.

657
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:29,458
I am very, very confident we can do this.
I am sure about it.

658
00:46:30,041 --> 00:46:32,875
The only thing we need from you, sir, is…

659
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:36,083
the permission of the mayor of Lahore.

660
00:46:39,208 --> 00:46:40,208
Okay.

661
00:46:40,291 --> 00:46:43,666
Sir, shifting a house from one country
to another is not a big deal,

662
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:45,208
if we keep our egos in check.

663
00:46:46,875 --> 00:46:49,750
If we accept it
with an open heart and see this,

664
00:46:50,458 --> 00:46:53,791
we are bringing
that house here, just like…

665
00:46:53,875 --> 00:46:56,875
A villager would bring
a jar of ghee with him to the city.

666
00:46:58,291 --> 00:46:59,708
Exactly, sir.

667
00:46:59,791 --> 00:47:02,375
Or a jar of pickles.

668
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:06,750
I hope you got me, ma'am.

669
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:14,291
-Tell me something.
-Yes, sir?

670
00:47:14,375 --> 00:47:16,083
What'd the Pakistan High Commission say?

671
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,250
I am in touch with them.

672
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:20,416
I haven't gotten permission,
but it'll be handled. I'll get it.

673
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:24,166
Same case with everything related to them.
Anyway, you have our support.

674
00:47:24,666 --> 00:47:27,125
-Thank you.
-He means you have our moral support.

675
00:47:27,208 --> 00:47:28,666
-He is right.
-Yes.

676
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:30,416
What do I do with moral support?

677
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:33,750
We mean, we support you,
but there's nothing official about it.

678
00:47:33,833 --> 00:47:35,166
Yes.

679
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:36,666
Because if we initiate it

680
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:40,375
and they back out,
then our scores will dip.

681
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:42,791
-Right.
-Score?

682
00:47:42,875 --> 00:47:44,125
What scores are you keeping?

683
00:47:44,208 --> 00:47:46,958
This isn't a badminton match between kids.
This isn't fair.

684
00:47:47,041 --> 00:47:51,375
The thing is, Pakistan can back out
from a promise any time.

685
00:47:51,458 --> 00:47:52,583
Exactly.

686
00:47:52,666 --> 00:47:54,708
-Then people will laugh at us.
-Right.

687
00:47:54,791 --> 00:47:58,708
That's why you have our full support,
but we stay in the shadows.

688
00:47:58,791 --> 00:47:59,750
Yes.

689
00:47:59,833 --> 00:48:02,916
I mean, in this case India will be…

690
00:48:04,166 --> 00:48:05,166
Mr. India?

691
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:06,333
Yes!

692
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:09,791
If you manage to bring your home back,

693
00:48:09,875 --> 00:48:13,583
don't forget to tag the Ministry
of International Relations in your tweets.

694
00:48:13,666 --> 00:48:16,708
-Right.
-Please remember that. Right, ma'am?

695
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,625
What company is helping you?

696
00:48:21,708 --> 00:48:23,833
-Gently Gently.
-Huh?

697
00:48:23,916 --> 00:48:25,250
Gently Gently.

698
00:48:25,333 --> 00:48:27,125
Name of your other team members?

699
00:48:28,666 --> 00:48:29,791
A. Radha Lakshmi.

700
00:48:34,125 --> 00:48:35,041
Hello?

701
00:48:35,625 --> 00:48:37,750
Hello, may I speak to Ms. Radha?

702
00:48:37,833 --> 00:48:39,500
Speaking. How can I help you?

703
00:48:40,958 --> 00:48:41,833
Take.

704
00:48:41,916 --> 00:48:42,916
<i>Hello?</i>

705
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:46,708
<i>Hello?</i>

706
00:48:49,375 --> 00:48:50,333
Hello, Radha?

707
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:56,083
Hello? Amreek?

708
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Can I talk to you? Just for two minutes?

709
00:49:02,958 --> 00:49:05,375
Make it quick. I don't have time to waste.

710
00:49:07,708 --> 00:49:10,583
-Sardar doesn't either.
-Why? What's wrong with her?

711
00:49:13,208 --> 00:49:14,125
Tumor.

712
00:49:15,458 --> 00:49:19,708
But that's not the reason I called you.
Actually, I need your help.

713
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:22,333
-Professional help.
-Professional?

714
00:49:22,416 --> 00:49:23,416
Yes.

715
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,833
Sardar wants to visit her old house,
but it is in Lahore.

716
00:49:43,125 --> 00:49:46,708
Radha, why do I feel
you won't be able to say no to this?

717
00:49:47,291 --> 00:49:48,500
You feel wrong, Amreek.

718
00:49:49,458 --> 00:49:52,416
I can't say I feel right or wrong,
but I certainly feel bad.

719
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:56,875
The fact is, like all your other plans,
you'll abandon this one as well.

720
00:49:58,208 --> 00:50:00,375
You have a wrong image of me in your mind.

721
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:04,375
You call after so many days
because of work.

722
00:50:04,458 --> 00:50:06,500
You won't help me
because I didn't apologize?

723
00:50:06,583 --> 00:50:10,083
What is this if not your ego speaking?
You too could have called me.

724
00:50:10,833 --> 00:50:12,833
Who asked me to leave, Amreek?

725
00:50:14,666 --> 00:50:16,791
Thank you for giving me
your precious time.

726
00:50:16,875 --> 00:50:17,875
You know what?

727
00:50:18,833 --> 00:50:20,458
Good luck. Bye.

728
00:50:20,541 --> 00:50:21,541
Thank you, bye.

729
00:50:24,625 --> 00:50:26,083
She refused to help!

730
00:50:26,958 --> 00:50:28,125
So, you are not going?

731
00:50:30,958 --> 00:50:31,958
I am going there.

732
00:50:33,458 --> 00:50:34,833
I am going there for sure.

733
00:50:35,833 --> 00:50:37,833
And I'll do this without her help.

734
00:50:38,666 --> 00:50:40,458
Why are we playing "I Spy," Mom?

735
00:50:40,875 --> 00:50:43,750
Why am I spying on someone
instead of running the company?

736
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:47,375
Such an idiot!
Sometimes I doubt you're my child.

737
00:50:57,125 --> 00:50:58,791
Pinky! Come here.

738
00:50:59,625 --> 00:51:02,291
Why is your sense of style
so different than the rest?

739
00:51:03,291 --> 00:51:06,000
Come here.
Let me check your scalp for dandruff.

740
00:51:06,083 --> 00:51:10,916
I keep telling you to apply eggs,
try a conditioner, but you pay me no heed.

741
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,458
Your hair has become so dry.
It looks like a tail.

742
00:51:13,541 --> 00:51:16,875
And you should pinch your cheeks
like this. They become rosy.

743
00:51:16,958 --> 00:51:19,833
-It's all okay. You can go now.
-My whole family is crazy.

744
00:51:19,916 --> 00:51:22,291
Mix an egg in the hair conditioner
and apply it.

745
00:51:22,541 --> 00:51:24,375
Did you see or find anything useful?

746
00:51:24,458 --> 00:51:25,875
Mom, tell me something.

747
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:28,666
The story of Amreek falling
from the dining table, is it true?

748
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:29,875
Yes it is, why?

749
00:51:29,958 --> 00:51:33,583
He is planning to wrap up the house
in Pakistan and bring it back to India.

750
00:51:33,666 --> 00:51:35,791
Will it still have all the things in it?

751
00:51:35,875 --> 00:51:38,541
I am not talking
about the things inside the house.

752
00:51:38,625 --> 00:51:39,750
The entire house.

753
00:51:40,333 --> 00:51:42,833
From Pakistan to Amritsar.

754
00:51:43,583 --> 00:51:46,458
Look carefully.
This is where we will lay its foundation.

755
00:51:46,541 --> 00:51:49,000
Oh, ho! Don't worry, sir.
It will be handled.

756
00:51:49,083 --> 00:51:51,291
I'll hold you responsible
if anything goes wrong.

757
00:51:51,375 --> 00:51:53,541
Oh, ho! Leave everything to me, sir.

758
00:51:53,625 --> 00:51:55,083
Get this straight.

759
00:51:55,875 --> 00:51:58,500
No one other than you
knows that I am going there.

760
00:51:58,583 --> 00:52:01,791
If anyone finds out,
I won't pay you a single penny.

761
00:52:01,875 --> 00:52:05,083
This thing will stay between us
if you make the payment on time.

762
00:52:05,166 --> 00:52:06,083
Let's go.

763
00:52:06,166 --> 00:52:09,000
-Sukha! It's 30 by 40 square feet.
-Coming!

764
00:52:09,083 --> 00:52:10,625
Let's get on with it.

765
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:15,208
So, what's going on out here, huh?

766
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:22,416
Did you get it?

767
00:52:23,666 --> 00:52:25,833
If not for that fall
from the dining table…

768
00:52:25,916 --> 00:52:29,041
Let's not discuss that again.
I am doing this for Sardar.

769
00:52:29,125 --> 00:52:32,375
It's useless to share anything
with you two. A waste of time.

770
00:52:32,458 --> 00:52:33,791
You weren't sharing.

771
00:52:33,875 --> 00:52:37,833
It was me who found out
that no one should find out about it.

772
00:52:37,916 --> 00:52:41,291
What will we tell Sardar
when she asks about your whereabouts?

773
00:52:41,375 --> 00:52:44,666
Lovely will ensure the company gets
transferred to him while you are gone.

774
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:46,958
Can you think of anything
besides the company?

775
00:52:47,041 --> 00:52:49,958
Well, I just have one son. My only child.

776
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:52,583
Why should I let him go to Pakistan?

777
00:52:52,666 --> 00:52:54,791
Let him finish.

778
00:52:54,875 --> 00:52:57,083
You are the one interrupting. Keep quiet.

779
00:52:57,166 --> 00:52:59,458
Me? You're the one talking since morning.

780
00:52:59,541 --> 00:53:01,000
-I won't stop talking?
-Right.

781
00:53:01,083 --> 00:53:02,583
-You didn't say anything!
-Strange.

782
00:53:02,666 --> 00:53:04,333
Can I say something?

783
00:53:06,041 --> 00:53:07,208
Please.

784
00:53:07,291 --> 00:53:08,958
Go ahead, kiddo. Shoot.

785
00:53:12,291 --> 00:53:13,833
Sardar has promised…

786
00:53:15,041 --> 00:53:18,041
to make me the CEO of Champion Cycles,

787
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:22,333
if I manage to take her to that house.

788
00:53:23,625 --> 00:53:28,000
Simi!
Gurbaz would love some tea made by you.

789
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:30,291
This.

790
00:53:32,708 --> 00:53:34,375
Once I bring Sardar's home back,

791
00:53:34,958 --> 00:53:39,666
you won't ever have to worry
about Lovely or making tea.

792
00:53:49,708 --> 00:53:51,541
Here, some snacks for the journey.

793
00:53:51,625 --> 00:53:54,000
I am going to Pakistan,
not a school picnic.

794
00:53:54,083 --> 00:53:56,500
-Keep it. What if you feel hungry?
-Fine.

795
00:53:56,583 --> 00:53:58,291
-Sweater?
-Packed.

796
00:53:58,375 --> 00:53:59,750
-Underwear?
-Mom!

797
00:53:59,833 --> 00:54:02,208
What "Mom"? Digestive?

798
00:54:03,583 --> 00:54:05,583
It's difficult to digest food abroad.

799
00:54:05,666 --> 00:54:07,375
This is my first trip abroad?

800
00:54:08,958 --> 00:54:10,541
Come on. Come here.

801
00:54:11,208 --> 00:54:14,833
Stand still. Let me ward off the evil.

802
00:54:14,916 --> 00:54:16,666
No one will cast an evil eye on me.

803
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:20,000
Don't forget to pack the coconut.
I'll go get the sweet yogurt.

804
00:54:20,083 --> 00:54:21,458
Sorry.

805
00:54:21,541 --> 00:54:26,458
I didn't think twice
before lashing out at you, son.

806
00:54:27,041 --> 00:54:29,458
It's very easy
to lose one's temper at my age.

807
00:54:30,833 --> 00:54:32,875
But you are young.

808
00:54:33,666 --> 00:54:36,416
You should have just run away,
stayed out of my reach.

809
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:40,416
Do you want me to hold my ears
and apologize? Here, I am sorry. Sorry.

810
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,458
Please forgive me.

811
00:54:42,541 --> 00:54:44,000
Poor little thing.

812
00:54:45,166 --> 00:54:47,000
Is Amreek your favorite grandchild?

813
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:49,958
-Come on.
-Yes, of course.

814
00:54:50,041 --> 00:54:51,500
This dog's her favorite.

815
00:54:52,208 --> 00:54:54,208
Look at what she's done to him.

816
00:54:56,333 --> 00:54:58,541
Where are you off to with your bag?

817
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,750
America, for some time.
I'll be back before you know it.

818
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:06,750
And what if I die before you come back?

819
00:55:06,833 --> 00:55:08,500
No, Sardar. The thing is…

820
00:55:08,583 --> 00:55:11,083
I know.
Your Gently Mentally must called you.

821
00:55:11,166 --> 00:55:12,833
No, you don't get it.

822
00:55:12,916 --> 00:55:15,458
And what about the promise
you had made me?

823
00:55:15,541 --> 00:55:17,791
Weren't we supposed to go
to our home to Lahore?

824
00:55:17,875 --> 00:55:20,500
I never said we won't be going.
Give me some time.

825
00:55:22,458 --> 00:55:25,125
Pinky, you are my favorite grandchild.

826
00:55:26,291 --> 00:55:27,333
Let's go.

827
00:55:27,833 --> 00:55:31,083
Come on. Get out of my way.

828
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:36,333
Such a selfish boy.
He's going back to America.

829
00:55:37,583 --> 00:55:39,583
He promised to take me to Lahore.

830
00:55:40,291 --> 00:55:41,583
He's such a liar.

831
00:55:41,666 --> 00:55:43,583
I've understood everyone's intentions.

832
00:55:44,208 --> 00:55:46,833
Why don't you just kill me? Come on.

833
00:56:00,125 --> 00:56:03,000
Look, we have broken all the past records.

834
00:56:04,125 --> 00:56:06,458
Champion is reigning in the city.

835
00:56:07,416 --> 00:56:09,583
I have made a five-year plan.

836
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:12,375
I intend to make Champion Cycles
an international brand.

837
00:56:12,458 --> 00:56:13,916
I will make it the top brand.

838
00:56:23,458 --> 00:56:24,708
Don't open the window.

839
00:56:25,458 --> 00:56:27,583
Our child is feeling suffocated.

840
00:56:27,666 --> 00:56:28,958
So am I.

841
00:56:30,083 --> 00:56:31,916
But our child is feeling suffocated.

842
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,750
Use your brains.

843
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:36,041
I want some fresh air.

844
00:56:36,875 --> 00:56:40,000
-Riots are taking place out there.
-But not in our lane, right?

845
00:56:40,083 --> 00:56:42,375
Will people of our neighborhood
go against each other?

846
00:56:42,458 --> 00:56:45,541
-Do we have any enemies here?
-No one is anyone's enemy.

847
00:56:45,625 --> 00:56:47,875
But people are not
acting reasonable out there.

848
00:56:47,958 --> 00:56:48,958
I don't care.

849
00:56:49,041 --> 00:56:51,375
Everyone here is good,
irrespective of religion.

850
00:56:51,458 --> 00:56:54,833
-Why don't you understand?
-I don't want to understand.

851
00:56:55,666 --> 00:56:58,250
We all fought for our country's freedom,

852
00:56:58,333 --> 00:57:01,666
so that we fear
and hide from our own countrymen?

853
00:57:02,041 --> 00:57:03,500
You want to stay hidden here?

854
00:57:03,583 --> 00:57:06,000
Everyone is right. You are indeed crazy.

855
00:57:06,083 --> 00:57:09,541
If you think I am crazy, then so be it.
Get this straight, mister.

856
00:57:10,791 --> 00:57:13,250
This crazy woman
wants to spend her life with you.

857
00:57:14,208 --> 00:57:15,500
Do you get it?

858
00:57:17,791 --> 00:57:20,291
Sardar! Open the door!

859
00:57:20,375 --> 00:57:22,500
Break Sardar's door!

860
00:57:23,333 --> 00:57:24,708
Break it!

861
00:57:24,791 --> 00:57:26,708
Break it, guys!

862
00:57:26,791 --> 00:57:28,583
Let's just break it!

863
00:57:28,666 --> 00:57:31,125
Break the door!

864
00:57:31,208 --> 00:57:33,583
We will kill everyone!

865
00:57:33,666 --> 00:57:37,375
-Long live Pakistan!
-I have never refused you anything.

866
00:57:37,458 --> 00:57:38,791
Don't be stubborn today.

867
00:57:38,875 --> 00:57:41,375
-Come what may, don't step out.
-Break the door!

868
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:44,625
Don't spare anyone! Attack!

869
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:11,958
<i>Oh, mere mortal</i>

870
00:59:14,125 --> 00:59:19,916
<i>Oh, mere mortal</i>

871
00:59:23,166 --> 00:59:29,708
<i>Oh, mere mortal</i>

872
00:59:31,541 --> 00:59:37,375
<i>Oh, mere mortal</i>

873
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:46,083
<i>Oh, mere mortal</i>

874
00:59:49,666 --> 00:59:55,916
<i>Oh, mere mortal</i>

875
00:59:56,833 --> 01:00:00,791
<i>Oh, mere mortal</i>

876
01:00:07,666 --> 01:00:10,125
Why didn't you tell Sardar?

877
01:00:11,083 --> 01:00:13,541
What's the use of telling her beforehand?

878
01:00:14,541 --> 01:00:16,666
I am known for abandoning things halfway.

879
01:00:18,208 --> 01:00:20,333
If I make a mistake this time…

880
01:00:24,291 --> 01:00:26,000
I didn't want to break her heart.

881
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:31,208
You won't tell her anything
until I see this through.

882
01:00:31,291 --> 01:00:34,083
Okay? You won't tell her anything.

883
01:00:34,833 --> 01:00:36,583
Okay, I won't tell her anything.

884
01:00:38,833 --> 01:00:40,125
We belong to Khalsa.

885
01:00:41,333 --> 01:00:42,916
All victories belong to Him.

886
01:00:43,833 --> 01:00:49,083
<i>Life is slipping away</i>

887
01:00:49,166 --> 01:00:54,041
<i>The ground is melting</i>

888
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:57,625
<i>Your sun has no luster</i>

889
01:00:57,708 --> 01:01:00,333
<i>Your shore is miles away</i>

890
01:01:00,416 --> 01:01:03,458
<i>But you need to keep walking</i>

891
01:01:03,541 --> 01:01:06,291
<i>You need to keep walking, my friend</i>

892
01:01:06,375 --> 01:01:09,375
<i>You need to keep walking, my friend</i>

893
01:01:11,166 --> 01:01:15,041
<i>The blisters on your feet</i>

894
01:01:15,125 --> 01:01:17,458
<i>Will be your guiding light</i>

895
01:01:17,541 --> 01:01:20,750
<i>The blisters on your feet</i>

896
01:01:20,833 --> 01:01:23,375
<i>Will be your guiding light</i>

897
01:01:23,458 --> 01:01:27,958
<i>Stay determined and keep moving</i>

898
01:01:28,041 --> 01:01:32,208
<i>Oh, mere mortal</i>
<i>God is with you</i>

899
01:01:33,791 --> 01:01:40,750
<i>Oh, mere mortal</i>
<i>God is with you</i>

900
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:52,041
<i>You are as strong as iron</i>

901
01:01:53,291 --> 01:01:56,125
<i>You are as strong as iron</i>

902
01:01:56,208 --> 01:01:58,875
<i>Your courage is tremendous</i>

903
01:01:58,958 --> 01:02:03,875
<i>You can win the world</i>

904
01:02:26,583 --> 01:02:30,833
<i>Oh, mere mortal</i>
<i>God is with you</i>

905
01:02:32,375 --> 01:02:37,583
<i>Oh, mere mortal</i>
<i>God is with you</i>

906
01:02:37,666 --> 01:02:44,541
<i>Oh, mere mortal</i>
<i>God is with you</i>

907
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:50,208
The Lahore Fort. What do you think of it?

908
01:02:50,291 --> 01:02:51,875
It's just like our Red Fort.

909
01:02:54,666 --> 01:02:56,958
So tell me, where do you want to go?

910
01:02:57,041 --> 01:02:59,708
Sheesh Mahal, Lahore Fort?
What would you like to see?

911
01:02:59,791 --> 01:03:02,833
No, I am only interested
in Kabootarwali Gully.

912
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:06,916
I get it.

913
01:03:07,625 --> 01:03:09,750
You are not interested
in famous monuments.

914
01:03:13,791 --> 01:03:15,083
That's a shortcut.

915
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:17,000
You'll have to go on foot from here.

916
01:03:18,458 --> 01:03:19,958
-This is it?
-Yes.

917
01:03:22,041 --> 01:03:24,250
Excuse me. Where's 36 Kabootarwali Gully?

918
01:03:24,833 --> 01:03:26,541
God is the savior of all pathways.

919
01:03:27,833 --> 01:03:29,791
36 Kabootarwali Gully?

920
01:03:29,875 --> 01:03:32,541
The lane on the left is a shortcut.
I take that route.

921
01:03:32,625 --> 01:03:35,833
Why don't you take a left,
no take a right.

922
01:03:35,916 --> 01:03:37,208
First right or left, sir?

923
01:03:37,791 --> 01:03:39,708
Left. First left then right.

924
01:03:39,791 --> 01:03:40,833
Thanks.

925
01:03:40,916 --> 01:03:45,875
<i>Enter the roundabout,</i>
<i>take the second exit. Turn left.</i>

926
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,333
Can I have two dozen eggs?

927
01:03:57,708 --> 01:04:01,666
-Two dozen?
-Yes, pack some bread as well.

928
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:03,708
I need to make
all the preparations, sister.

929
01:04:03,791 --> 01:04:05,291
What are you saying?
Yes, please.

930
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:07,375
Oh, God.
They are demolishing that house.

931
01:04:07,875 --> 01:04:09,708
Excuse me, where's house number 36?

932
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:40,583
Don't make a video.

933
01:04:46,208 --> 01:04:47,458
Excuse me, please.

934
01:04:47,541 --> 01:04:51,333
Move back, everyone. Please move back.

935
01:04:51,416 --> 01:04:53,541
What are you doing?
You will die! Hey!

936
01:04:53,625 --> 01:04:55,791
Are you crazy? Stop!
Move aside!

937
01:04:55,875 --> 01:05:00,708
Someone stop him! He has gone crazy.
Get down! Get down!

938
01:05:00,791 --> 01:05:03,333
Do you want to kill me? It's too high.

939
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:08,125
Stop it, please.
What have you gotten me into, Sardar?

940
01:05:08,875 --> 01:05:12,250
Who are you? Have you lost your mind?
Get down.

941
01:05:12,333 --> 01:05:15,541
This is my grandma's house.
This is why I am here.

942
01:05:15,625 --> 01:05:18,166
I have come
to take this house back to India.

943
01:05:19,291 --> 01:05:22,458
Take the house?
Where did this lunatic come from?

944
01:05:22,541 --> 01:05:23,958
He has lost his mind.

945
01:05:24,041 --> 01:05:25,916
Someone get him off it. Get him down.

946
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,916
Why? How can you break anyone's house?

947
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,708
He is right.
You cannot just break anyone's house.

948
01:05:30,791 --> 01:05:35,000
Hey, you are a tea-maker.
Go make tea. Mind your own business.

949
01:05:35,083 --> 01:05:36,875
Listen? He really left to make tea!

950
01:05:36,958 --> 01:05:38,458
Hey you, bring it down.

951
01:05:41,041 --> 01:05:44,333
-Stop.
-Why did you guys let him through?

952
01:05:44,416 --> 01:05:46,750
-Let's just talk this out.
-Hey!

953
01:05:46,833 --> 01:05:48,500
While you are holding a brick?

954
01:05:48,583 --> 01:05:51,208
He didn't hit you with it.
A person can't defend himself?

955
01:05:51,291 --> 01:05:54,416
You're back? Don't you have any shame?
Want me to teach you a lesson?

956
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:55,750
But this kid is right.

957
01:05:55,833 --> 01:05:58,625
Oh, I see.
You two have planned it together.

958
01:05:58,708 --> 01:05:59,833
Plan? What plan?

959
01:05:59,916 --> 01:06:02,791
The plan to take over
someone else's property.

960
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:04,958
You've illegally taken it over
for the past year.

961
01:06:05,041 --> 01:06:07,916
He is not with me.
Let me talk to the person in charge.

962
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,958
Okay, I'll call him. Call the police.

963
01:06:10,041 --> 01:06:11,875
He wants to talk to the person in charge.

964
01:06:11,958 --> 01:06:14,083
Hurry up. It'll soon be six o'clock.

965
01:06:14,166 --> 01:06:16,166
We need to finish this job and pack up.

966
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:18,208
I'll call the police.

967
01:06:18,291 --> 01:06:19,666
-Look at the time.
-Hello.

968
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:22,291
We need to do something
or they'll demolish the house.

969
01:06:22,375 --> 01:06:23,875
No, no, no. What do we do?

970
01:06:24,708 --> 01:06:25,791
Yes.

971
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:29,375
You can't just demolish anything!
You just can't!

972
01:06:30,916 --> 01:06:33,541
You just can't!

973
01:06:33,625 --> 01:06:36,708
-Contractor, go back, go back!
-Go back, go back!

974
01:06:36,791 --> 01:06:39,250
What is this nonsense?

975
01:06:39,333 --> 01:06:42,500
-Go back… Contractor…
-Contractor, shame on you!

976
01:06:50,625 --> 01:06:53,708
-Listen to me. Let me go.
-Tarzan!

977
01:06:53,791 --> 01:06:56,541
The kid's saying something.
Let me hear. Yes, tell me.

978
01:06:59,875 --> 01:07:01,333
Hey!

979
01:07:01,416 --> 01:07:03,458
The key!

980
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:06,583
Stop!

981
01:07:06,666 --> 01:07:08,708
-Tarzan, this way.
-Stop calling me that!

982
01:07:11,625 --> 01:07:13,875
Stop. Where are you taking them? Stop!

983
01:07:15,625 --> 01:07:16,833
The keys…

984
01:07:18,125 --> 01:07:19,750
-Give me the key.
-Here you go.

985
01:07:20,416 --> 01:07:22,958
Are you crazy?
Why did you throw it up there?

986
01:07:23,625 --> 01:07:25,833
-We'll use the ladder.
-Yes, let's go inside.

987
01:07:25,916 --> 01:07:27,416
-This one!
-This one is faster?

988
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:30,291
Help. This ladder
will get us up there faster.

989
01:07:30,375 --> 01:07:31,666
Please help me out.

990
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:34,083
-Yes, set it up.
-Come on, come.

991
01:07:34,166 --> 01:07:36,625
-Hold it, I'll climb the ladder.
-Get down.

992
01:07:36,708 --> 01:07:38,416
We will take turns to climb up.

993
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:40,041
Are you crazy? I'll go first.

994
01:07:41,166 --> 01:07:43,625
I will not spare you.
Did you call me a child?

995
01:07:43,708 --> 01:07:45,583
-I called you Chhote.
-Stop!

996
01:07:50,791 --> 01:07:51,916
Did you call me a child?

997
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,916
Where do you think you are going? Stop!

998
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,166
-Come down!
-No!

999
01:07:58,750 --> 01:07:59,958
Sorry!

1000
01:08:01,875 --> 01:08:04,375
-I got the keys!
-Throw it down.

1001
01:08:05,083 --> 01:08:06,791
Give it to me.

1002
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:11,166
-Why did you throw the key away?
-Sorry.

1003
01:08:19,208 --> 01:08:20,416
The police are here.

1004
01:08:22,375 --> 01:08:23,500
Hold this.

1005
01:08:24,625 --> 01:08:25,708
Where are you going?

1006
01:08:25,791 --> 01:08:27,083
To save my hide.

1007
01:08:27,166 --> 01:08:29,083
-Hey, mister. Who are you?
-Yes?

1008
01:08:29,166 --> 01:08:30,583
Who is this crazy boy?

1009
01:08:32,833 --> 01:08:34,416
Why have you caused havoc?

1010
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:37,458
Troubling everyone unnecessarily.
If my temperament changes…

1011
01:08:37,541 --> 01:08:40,625
Sir, that is my ancestral home. That one.

1012
01:08:40,708 --> 01:08:43,458
-This house belongs to Uncle Feroz.
-Before the partition.

1013
01:08:43,541 --> 01:08:47,125
My grandma had said that it used to belong
to some cycle company owner.

1014
01:08:47,208 --> 01:08:49,833
Yes, before the partition took place.
Champion Cycles.

1015
01:08:49,916 --> 01:08:53,125
My grandfather built it.
I'm taking it back for my grandma.

1016
01:08:53,875 --> 01:08:56,000
-A devotee of Lord Hanuman, are you?
-Huh?

1017
01:08:56,083 --> 01:08:58,041
Take the mountain instead of the herb?

1018
01:08:58,125 --> 01:09:01,083
If your grandma wants to see the house,
then bring her here.

1019
01:09:01,625 --> 01:09:02,750
She cannot come here.

1020
01:09:02,833 --> 01:09:05,625
It's a long story
and she doesn't have too long.

1021
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:09,458
She… Hear me out, sir.
What are you doing, sir?

1022
01:09:09,541 --> 01:09:11,666
Please hear me out, sir. Sir.

1023
01:09:13,083 --> 01:09:14,583
Pack up!

1024
01:09:16,166 --> 01:09:17,875
-Take him away.
-Let's go, mister.

1025
01:09:18,750 --> 01:09:21,416
We'll surely demolish this house tomorrow.

1026
01:09:35,625 --> 01:09:36,666
Any fake documents?

1027
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:38,958
No, sir. All of them are in order.

1028
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:40,750
He's from Punjab, Amritsar.

1029
01:09:40,833 --> 01:09:44,625
A non-resident, a green card holder.
His name is Amreek Singh.

1030
01:09:44,708 --> 01:09:48,250
I made a call to the Delhi authorities.
They gave me the same reason.

1031
01:09:50,875 --> 01:09:53,583
Get him. Get his highness inside.

1032
01:09:53,666 --> 01:09:55,291
Also call the builder, Mr. Khan.

1033
01:09:56,375 --> 01:09:59,000
-Oh, this is so simple. So very simple.
-Yes.

1034
01:09:59,083 --> 01:10:00,708
-Correct.
-Why don't you do this?

1035
01:10:00,791 --> 01:10:04,166
As you are already here,
take the entire nation with you.

1036
01:10:05,166 --> 01:10:08,208
You can find a nice green patch in Punjab
and place it there.

1037
01:10:08,291 --> 01:10:10,583
Sir… Do you have 4G network?

1038
01:10:10,666 --> 01:10:12,750
What will you do? Click a selfie with me?

1039
01:10:12,833 --> 01:10:15,708
-Later. Look at this video.
-I am not interested.

1040
01:10:15,791 --> 01:10:17,083
-Please.
-What is it?

1041
01:10:17,166 --> 01:10:19,291
A computer can make
a video of shopping on Mars.

1042
01:10:19,375 --> 01:10:21,166
-Forget Mars. Look.
-It is a lie.

1043
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:23,541
It's Earth.
They lift and place it on a truck.

1044
01:10:23,625 --> 01:10:26,333
Have a look. It is true, sir.

1045
01:10:26,416 --> 01:10:29,333
This is how I will take it, sir.
Without troubling anyone.

1046
01:10:30,375 --> 01:10:32,958
Sir, where is that despicable man?

1047
01:10:33,041 --> 01:10:34,833
I lost 200,000 rupees because of him.

1048
01:10:34,916 --> 01:10:37,583
-Mr. Khan, relax.
-No one ever claimed that wreckage.

1049
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:40,708
Suddenly, someone shows up
and claims it's his house.

1050
01:10:40,791 --> 01:10:43,375
I want to meet him
and find out what he wants.

1051
01:10:50,041 --> 01:10:53,625
Do you know the loss I incurred?
You owe me 200,000! Shell it out.

1052
01:10:53,708 --> 01:10:56,333
Why do I owe you?
For what, sir? It is my house.

1053
01:10:56,416 --> 01:10:59,875
I won't let
any of your usurping plans succeed.

1054
01:10:59,958 --> 01:11:02,291
What plan?
Usurping what, sir? It is my house.

1055
01:11:02,375 --> 01:11:03,708
-What will you do?
-As I please.

1056
01:11:03,791 --> 01:11:07,291
-Make poppadums on its rooftop?
-Yes. It is my house.

1057
01:11:07,875 --> 01:11:10,916
I'll file a case against you.
I won't spare him.

1058
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,791
Old age does make everyone go bonkers,
Sardar included.

1059
01:11:13,875 --> 01:11:15,625
They keep shouting for no good reason.

1060
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:17,375
Should I run away?

1061
01:11:17,458 --> 01:11:18,500
No, my bag?

1062
01:11:19,166 --> 01:11:20,041
Passport?

1063
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,500
This is great. Amazing.
Come, give me a hug.

1064
01:11:27,916 --> 01:11:30,500
Why didn't you tell me
that you were from Amritsar?

1065
01:11:30,583 --> 01:11:33,458
-What's the connection with this?
-A big connection.

1066
01:11:33,541 --> 01:11:37,166
I am from Amritsar.
I was born in Amritsar.

1067
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:41,666
We used to own a huge bakery,
Khan's Bakery. Have you ever heard of it?

1068
01:11:42,916 --> 01:11:44,625
Come, I'll treat you to a Lahori tea.

1069
01:11:44,708 --> 01:11:47,083
-Come.
-Sir, I want the house, not the tea.

1070
01:11:47,166 --> 01:11:50,041
You will get the house. Let's go.
Listen, you know…

1071
01:11:50,125 --> 01:11:51,583
My bakery was next to it.

1072
01:11:51,666 --> 01:11:54,041
If it is so famous,
it'll surely be on the Internet.

1073
01:11:54,125 --> 01:11:56,750
I wouldn't need to ask you
if it was on the Internet.

1074
01:11:56,833 --> 01:11:59,000
-You can take whatever you want.
-Really?

1075
01:12:00,333 --> 01:12:03,166
The land is what I am after.
I won't give that to you.

1076
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:06,125
Nor will I let you stay here.
Let me make that clear.

1077
01:12:06,208 --> 01:12:07,541
I don't want the land.

1078
01:12:07,625 --> 01:12:10,791
That house belongs to my grandma.
I want to take it back. That's it.

1079
01:12:10,875 --> 01:12:12,625
You can take your grandma's house.

1080
01:12:12,708 --> 01:12:15,041
I have nothing to do with that structure.

1081
01:12:15,208 --> 01:12:18,125
May Allah bless you.
Thank you for giving it back to me.

1082
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:20,625
-I cannot thank you enough.
-Be happy.

1083
01:12:20,708 --> 01:12:23,083
I'll treat you to a Lahori tea.
I'm yearning for it.

1084
01:12:23,166 --> 01:12:24,166
Let's go.

1085
01:12:25,791 --> 01:12:29,666
To get the house,
you first need to bail yourself out.

1086
01:12:31,666 --> 01:12:33,250
Uncle!

1087
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:40,500
Sir, I am here from the Indian Embassy
to bail Amreek Singh out.

1088
01:12:42,541 --> 01:12:45,291
{\an8}I can't find his passport, sir.
I had kept it here.

1089
01:12:46,583 --> 01:12:49,208
Check thoroughly. It must be there.

1090
01:12:53,625 --> 01:12:57,125
It is with me. Just to keep it safe.

1091
01:12:59,791 --> 01:13:01,041
Say something.

1092
01:13:02,625 --> 01:13:05,166
Hello? At least tell me
when will they release him?

1093
01:13:06,875 --> 01:13:07,958
Oye!

1094
01:13:10,083 --> 01:13:13,125
Stay away from me.
I went to jail because of you.

1095
01:13:13,208 --> 01:13:16,416
What did I do?
You stood before the crane like Tarzan.

1096
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:19,583
Anyway, who would save the house
if I too had been arrested?

1097
01:13:19,666 --> 01:13:23,875
Shut up. Zip it.
You talk like you did all this to help me.

1098
01:13:23,958 --> 01:13:27,916
Oh, really? So you think God
sent the Indian Embassy staff here?

1099
01:13:29,166 --> 01:13:31,666
-How absurd!
-How absurd, indeed!

1100
01:13:35,916 --> 01:13:38,291
We are not interested
in getting into this mess.

1101
01:13:38,375 --> 01:13:39,791
That's me.

1102
01:13:39,875 --> 01:13:41,583
You are trending, mister.

1103
01:13:41,666 --> 01:13:43,208
On number four.

1104
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,833
Please don't drag us with you
when the matter escalates.

1105
01:13:55,708 --> 01:13:56,541
Listen up.

1106
01:13:58,666 --> 01:14:01,125
The Indian Embassy
doesn't know anything about this,

1107
01:14:01,208 --> 01:14:03,916
or the fact that you were bailed out.
Got that?

1108
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,791
Yes, Mr. India.

1109
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:09,791
Thank you, sir.

1110
01:14:17,583 --> 01:14:20,791
-Why are you following me?
-What, you own the streets as well?

1111
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:24,583
Quit following me. I won't pay you a dime.

1112
01:14:24,666 --> 01:14:27,166
No, sir. I don't want the money.

1113
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:30,208
Just sign a paper saying
I'm the caretaker of this property.

1114
01:14:30,291 --> 01:14:32,291
Of your grandfather's house.

1115
01:14:33,041 --> 01:14:35,708
Then it'll be between the builder and me.

1116
01:14:37,125 --> 01:14:38,708
Why would I sign any documents?

1117
01:14:39,416 --> 01:14:41,416
A friend in need is a friend in deed.

1118
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:46,250
Help me, and I might help you in this
foreign land whenever the need arises.

1119
01:14:46,833 --> 01:14:48,833
How can a tea seller possibly help me?

1120
01:14:48,916 --> 01:14:51,916
Your country keeps
underestimating tea sellers.

1121
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:53,666
Anyway, it's cool.

1122
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:55,125
Leave before I slap you.

1123
01:14:55,208 --> 01:14:57,333
Don't take my advice if you don't want to.

1124
01:14:57,416 --> 01:14:59,208
-Leave!
-I'm leaving. I'm leaving.

1125
01:15:00,416 --> 01:15:01,833
Bloody pest.

1126
01:16:51,291 --> 01:16:52,708
<i>Gursherji…</i>

1127
01:16:54,541 --> 01:16:57,125
please get our imported whiskey.

1128
01:16:58,125 --> 01:17:00,083
The others don't have the same kick.

1129
01:17:20,041 --> 01:17:23,833
Oh, ho! Please tell me
that was a glass and not the bottle.

1130
01:17:38,125 --> 01:17:40,041
-Nazneen?
-Yes.

1131
01:17:40,125 --> 01:17:42,000
-Washed the clothes?
-Yes.

1132
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:52,750
-Hi, Dad.
-How are you, Amreek?

1133
01:17:52,833 --> 01:17:54,375
Calm down. Let me talk to him.

1134
01:17:54,458 --> 01:17:57,166
{\an8}<i>You are trending, kiddo.</i>

1135
01:17:57,250 --> 01:18:00,666
I know, but make sure Sardar
doesn't find that out.

1136
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:01,666
Fine.

1137
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:03,833
Forget that.
I am going to meet the mayor.

1138
01:18:04,708 --> 01:18:07,208
I need Sardar's blessing.
Hand the phone to her.

1139
01:18:07,291 --> 01:18:11,500
Sardar. Look who wants to talk to you.

1140
01:18:11,583 --> 01:18:14,250
-Sardar!
-Just talk to him.

1141
01:18:14,333 --> 01:18:17,666
Dad, I cannot see her face.
Change the angle. Sardar!

1142
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:21,458
How rude! What was the phone's fault?
Who breaks phones?

1143
01:18:21,541 --> 01:18:25,208
And who breaks promises?
Your son broke his.

1144
01:18:26,791 --> 01:18:28,375
My whole family is insane.

1145
01:18:42,625 --> 01:18:43,833
-Hello, sir.
-Yes?

1146
01:18:44,458 --> 01:18:46,375
Amreek Singh. I have an appointment.

1147
01:18:47,791 --> 01:18:48,791
Please have a seat.

1148
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:19,875
<i>During India-Pakistan's match in Mohali,</i>
<i>a woman from Amritsar caused havoc,</i>

1149
01:19:19,958 --> 01:19:23,708
<i>by pulling the beard of a senior</i>
<i>government official from Islamabad,</i>

1150
01:19:23,791 --> 01:19:25,125
<i>and cussing him.</i>

1151
01:19:27,458 --> 01:19:29,000
Sir…

1152
01:19:29,083 --> 01:19:31,000
-Print it on the front page.
-Oh, no!

1153
01:19:32,166 --> 01:19:33,291
Saqlain Niazi.

1154
01:19:34,708 --> 01:19:38,500
Sir, if you could
please smile for the camera?

1155
01:19:42,583 --> 01:19:45,458
Sir, that man from India is here,
seeking your permission.

1156
01:19:45,541 --> 01:19:48,625
The one who wants to lift his house
and take it back to India.

1157
01:19:49,416 --> 01:19:52,125
People do such weird things
to stay in the news.

1158
01:19:52,208 --> 01:19:53,250
Right.

1159
01:19:53,333 --> 01:19:55,500
He thinks of himself as Sunny Deol.

1160
01:19:55,583 --> 01:19:57,750
Infiltrate enemy lines
and rescue the house.

1161
01:19:58,416 --> 01:20:00,583
Did we get any orders
from higher officials?

1162
01:20:00,666 --> 01:20:03,250
No, no official confirmation as of yet.

1163
01:20:03,333 --> 01:20:04,625
Very well.

1164
01:20:05,416 --> 01:20:08,791
You wanted to know how he works, right?

1165
01:20:08,875 --> 01:20:11,000
You'll now get
to see his style of working.

1166
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:13,416
-His style of working?
-Well…

1167
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:16,166
I tend to ignore all issues and riots,

1168
01:20:16,958 --> 01:20:21,958
as they tend to resolve on their own.

1169
01:20:22,541 --> 01:20:27,166
Delay the problem
and it will find its own solution.

1170
01:20:28,583 --> 01:20:30,458
-Call him.
-Okay.

1171
01:20:30,541 --> 01:20:32,166
I'll give you an example.

1172
01:20:34,958 --> 01:20:36,583
Please don't print this, sir.

1173
01:20:36,666 --> 01:20:38,125
Of course not, sir.

1174
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,291
Look, I will hear him out.

1175
01:20:42,375 --> 01:20:43,458
Okay.

1176
01:20:44,416 --> 01:20:46,875
But come what may,

1177
01:20:47,708 --> 01:20:49,291
I won't react to it in any way.

1178
01:20:49,375 --> 01:20:50,500
Okay, sir.

1179
01:20:50,583 --> 01:20:52,000
Please come in.

1180
01:20:55,125 --> 01:20:57,500
-Please come in.
-It's okay. Come in.

1181
01:20:59,916 --> 01:21:01,250
Yes. Have a seat.

1182
01:21:26,125 --> 01:21:28,333
Now see how he defers it.

1183
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:31,916
No. You cannot get this permission.

1184
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,916
As long as I'm the mayor of Lahore,
I won't permit it.

1185
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,375
My grandma isn't well.
Please reconsider it.

1186
01:21:37,458 --> 01:21:40,583
-Your grandma is crazy.
-You are the one who is crazy, sir.

1187
01:21:41,708 --> 01:21:44,750
You won't give us permission
because you're holding a grudge?

1188
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:47,833
-This is not fair.
-Get lost before I have you thrown out.

1189
01:21:47,916 --> 01:21:49,958
-Get him out. Security!
-Let's talk.

1190
01:21:50,041 --> 01:21:54,000
-I have the permission to come here.
-Throw him out. Take him away.

1191
01:21:54,083 --> 01:21:55,541
-Let's talk.
-Take him away.

1192
01:21:55,625 --> 01:21:58,083
-Please hear me out.
-Get lost. Call the builder.

1193
01:21:58,166 --> 01:22:00,375
-Sir, I have…
-Raze that house to the ground.

1194
01:22:00,458 --> 01:22:01,916
-My grandma…
-Come with me.

1195
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,041
Okay, okay. I am leaving.

1196
01:22:11,458 --> 01:22:12,583
Amreek's call.

1197
01:22:16,041 --> 01:22:16,958
Yes, kiddo?

1198
01:22:18,458 --> 01:22:19,833
I didn't get permission.

1199
01:22:23,416 --> 01:22:25,583
Why does this always happen to me?

1200
01:22:27,416 --> 01:22:29,208
My love story didn't work out.

1201
01:22:31,791 --> 01:22:34,791
The idea I had for our family business
didn't work out.

1202
01:22:39,125 --> 01:22:42,875
And the plan I had to fulfil
Sardar's dream also didn't work out.

1203
01:22:44,791 --> 01:22:47,750
It's okay. Don't feel disheartened.

1204
01:22:47,833 --> 01:22:50,166
You tried your best, didn't you?

1205
01:22:51,541 --> 01:22:52,500
Yes.

1206
01:22:58,166 --> 01:22:59,500
He didn't get permission.

1207
01:23:00,791 --> 01:23:03,625
I'm surprised that he expected
he’d get permission.

1208
01:23:03,708 --> 01:23:06,333
Movement of people is restricted
between the countries.

1209
01:23:06,416 --> 01:23:08,791
-He wants to bring a whole house.
-Hurry up!

1210
01:23:09,791 --> 01:23:11,625
Quick, come and check on Sardar.

1211
01:23:18,958 --> 01:23:21,958
-Oh, no!
-What happened, Sardar?

1212
01:23:22,916 --> 01:23:26,625
Why did you lie to me?
All of you are liars.

1213
01:23:28,208 --> 01:23:29,791
Who lied to you?

1214
01:23:31,458 --> 01:23:34,041
<i>I know I am going to die.</i>

1215
01:23:34,791 --> 01:23:36,458
I read all the reports.

1216
01:23:36,541 --> 01:23:38,916
Here, you read them!

1217
01:23:39,708 --> 01:23:43,666
What's the use of living anymore anyway?
I just asked for one thing.

1218
01:23:43,750 --> 01:23:48,916
I just wanted to go to Lahore.
But no one is interested in what I want.

1219
01:23:49,875 --> 01:23:53,666
<i>Listen, Sardar, Amreek is working on it.</i>

1220
01:23:53,750 --> 01:23:56,125
-As soon as he finds out…
-I don't care.

1221
01:23:56,208 --> 01:23:59,125
Why fill my body with poison
when I am going to die anyway?

1222
01:23:59,208 --> 01:24:03,458
I don't want to take these medicines!
Do whatever you please!

1223
01:24:17,333 --> 01:24:19,500
What happened? Did you get permission?

1224
01:24:33,916 --> 01:24:36,375
<i>-Salaam alaikum.</i>
<i>-Alaikum salaam</i>

1225
01:24:39,791 --> 01:24:41,375
-Mr. Khan.
-Yes?

1226
01:24:41,458 --> 01:24:43,208
Start demolishing the house.

1227
01:24:54,708 --> 01:24:56,041
Sorry.

1228
01:24:56,625 --> 01:24:59,041
I would have helped if I could.

1229
01:25:01,458 --> 01:25:02,625
It's okay.

1230
01:25:04,166 --> 01:25:06,000
A small gift for you.

1231
01:25:15,458 --> 01:25:16,583
Khan Bakery?

1232
01:25:25,833 --> 01:25:27,041
Thank you.

1233
01:25:37,791 --> 01:25:40,250
They will demolish it. It's not right.

1234
01:25:40,333 --> 01:25:41,833
They shouldn't demolish it.

1235
01:25:48,875 --> 01:25:50,791
Hurry up, mother. Walk faster.

1236
01:25:52,625 --> 01:25:54,458
There they go again.

1237
01:25:58,333 --> 01:26:00,541
-What is this nonsense?
-Those people…

1238
01:26:00,625 --> 01:26:02,208
There they go again.

1239
01:26:02,291 --> 01:26:04,083
All you need is a little hope,

1240
01:26:04,166 --> 01:26:06,666
and you will certainly get
the opportunity. Yes!

1241
01:26:08,333 --> 01:26:11,000
We have the right.
You cannot demolish this house.

1242
01:26:11,083 --> 01:26:13,875
You can't break this house.

1243
01:26:17,166 --> 01:26:18,583
Radha!

1244
01:26:19,416 --> 01:26:21,000
-Hi, guys!
-He's here…

1245
01:26:21,875 --> 01:26:23,083
-Hi.
-Hi.

1246
01:26:26,125 --> 01:26:29,208
Hey. Stop this drama.

1247
01:26:30,416 --> 01:26:33,750
Ever heard of K-P Antiquities Act 1997?

1248
01:26:34,625 --> 01:26:36,291
K-P 1997?

1249
01:26:36,833 --> 01:26:39,291
Isn't KP Kevin Peters?
What are you talking about?

1250
01:26:39,375 --> 01:26:41,291
I joined the force in '98.

1251
01:26:41,375 --> 01:26:45,416
The world won't come to an end if you know
something before you joined the force.

1252
01:26:47,083 --> 01:26:49,375
So you don't know. Let me explain.

1253
01:26:50,666 --> 01:26:53,916
You need special permission
from the archaeology department,

1254
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,875
to break any structure
more than 70 years old.

1255
01:26:56,958 --> 01:26:58,583
Do you have their permission?

1256
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,458
Do you have it? Please check.

1257
01:27:02,541 --> 01:27:05,416
-Let me check, sir.
-How do you know that?

1258
01:27:06,166 --> 01:27:10,166
Because an important
part of our job is called research.

1259
01:27:12,750 --> 01:27:14,166
Why bother with research?

1260
01:27:14,250 --> 01:27:17,541
I obviously didn't do it for you.
I am here to save the house.

1261
01:27:18,375 --> 01:27:19,666
I am here to do my job.

1262
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:24,000
The mayor asked us to demolish the house.
What more permission do we need?

1263
01:27:24,666 --> 01:27:28,291
I am sure Mr. Khan
already has all the important documents.

1264
01:27:29,625 --> 01:27:33,833
-No. I don't have the permission.
-What are you saying, Mr. Khan?

1265
01:27:33,916 --> 01:27:34,750
Stay out of it.

1266
01:27:36,208 --> 01:27:37,916
There is a rule in place.

1267
01:27:38,583 --> 01:27:41,000
This concerns
the archaeological department.

1268
01:27:41,083 --> 01:27:46,000
They are senior officials,
so they will take their sweet time, right?

1269
01:27:54,458 --> 01:27:57,875
I suspect you have
another reason for all this.

1270
01:27:59,041 --> 01:28:00,833
And if my suspicion is right,

1271
01:28:00,916 --> 01:28:05,291
even the entire Indian embassy
won't be able to find you.

1272
01:28:05,375 --> 01:28:08,333
They won't need to find me, sir.

1273
01:28:09,291 --> 01:28:12,875
Both the countries will be
aware of every move that I make.

1274
01:28:18,916 --> 01:28:20,375
-Will this frame work?
-Yes.

1275
01:28:20,458 --> 01:28:23,000
-Come on then. Perfect. Ready?
-Rolling.

1276
01:28:23,083 --> 01:28:26,708
Sir, you have become
an Internet sensation.

1277
01:28:26,791 --> 01:28:29,166
When you were standing before the crane,

1278
01:28:29,250 --> 01:28:32,333
did you imagine
that your stunt would break the Internet?

1279
01:28:33,416 --> 01:28:35,833
No, madam,
I wasn't thinking about all this.

1280
01:28:35,916 --> 01:28:38,375
I did all this to save this house.

1281
01:28:38,458 --> 01:28:41,791
Is there a special reason
behind taking this house with you?

1282
01:28:44,541 --> 01:28:45,750
This house…

1283
01:28:47,833 --> 01:28:50,458
It is my ancestral home
that belongs to my grandma.

1284
01:28:53,708 --> 01:28:55,000
She is 90 years old and…

1285
01:28:56,083 --> 01:28:58,625
not keeping too well.
She is running out of time.

1286
01:29:01,583 --> 01:29:04,250
I just want to fulfil her last wish.

1287
01:29:07,916 --> 01:29:10,375
During the partition…

1288
01:29:12,458 --> 01:29:16,083
people had to leave
a part of their lives behind.

1289
01:29:17,250 --> 01:29:18,875
-So that's why…
-Let's record it.

1290
01:29:18,958 --> 01:29:20,875
…with the help of you guys…

1291
01:29:20,958 --> 01:29:24,875
With the help of Pakistani media,
I want to make a request…

1292
01:29:26,375 --> 01:29:29,958
Please help me fulfil
my grandma's last wish.

1293
01:29:37,375 --> 01:29:39,500
Please let me take this house.

1294
01:29:40,458 --> 01:29:41,458
Please.

1295
01:29:42,625 --> 01:29:45,291
Come on, hurry up. Tripods stay over here.

1296
01:29:46,416 --> 01:29:49,000
{\an8}<i>I want to fulfil her last wish.</i>

1297
01:29:49,708 --> 01:29:50,958
{\an8}That's me.

1298
01:29:51,250 --> 01:29:53,166
{\an8}<i>Please let me take my grandma's home.</i>

1299
01:29:53,250 --> 01:29:54,458
Yes!

1300
01:29:56,708 --> 01:29:59,208
<i>-Let me take my grandma's house.</i>
-Do you think he'll do it?

1301
01:29:59,291 --> 01:30:01,708
Of course he will. He's my son after all.

1302
01:30:01,791 --> 01:30:03,291
That boy has become famous.

1303
01:30:04,166 --> 01:30:05,750
-Who?
-Look at this.

1304
01:30:06,583 --> 01:30:09,583
<i>Please let me take my grandma's home.</i>

1305
01:30:09,666 --> 01:30:12,250
Amreek Singh,
is attempting the impossible.

1306
01:30:12,333 --> 01:30:14,041
<i>He's appealing to the Pakistani and…</i>

1307
01:30:14,125 --> 01:30:18,208
<i>This will go down in history</i>
<i>as a grandson's love for his grandma.</i>

1308
01:30:18,291 --> 01:30:20,375
<i>…to allow him to carry the house across…</i>

1309
01:30:20,458 --> 01:30:23,583
{\an8}<i>Salaam alaikum.</i>
This is your friend, Amreek Si…

1310
01:30:23,666 --> 01:30:25,125
{\an8}-No, I am Amreek.
-Right.

1311
01:30:27,833 --> 01:30:28,958
<i>I believe…</i>

1312
01:30:29,041 --> 01:30:34,250
{\an8}I want peace to be restored
between the two countries.

1313
01:30:37,291 --> 01:30:39,125
Any statement made by Pakistan yet?

1314
01:30:40,041 --> 01:30:41,041
Not yet, sir.

1315
01:30:41,125 --> 01:30:45,500
We won't make headlines
if they release their statement first.

1316
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,750
-Make the call.
-Okay.

1317
01:30:56,791 --> 01:30:58,375
<i>-Namaste.</i>
<i>-Salaam alaikum.</i>

1318
01:30:58,458 --> 01:31:00,291
She is our country's grandmother.

1319
01:31:01,041 --> 01:31:02,750
And that house is our house.

1320
01:31:03,333 --> 01:31:05,583
{\an8}That's why we should all welcome

1321
01:31:05,666 --> 01:31:11,666
{\an8}this house back with open arms.

1322
01:31:11,750 --> 01:31:14,666
{\an8}<i>The news</i>
<i>about Kabootarwali Gully has reached me.</i>

1323
01:31:14,750 --> 01:31:15,875
{\an8}<i>As soon as I heard it,</i>

1324
01:31:15,958 --> 01:31:22,750
{\an8}<i>I felt that I should fulfil</i>
<i>my Indian sister's last wish.</i>

1325
01:31:23,791 --> 01:31:26,583
<i>When I learnt that</i>
<i>she is not keeping well…</i>

1326
01:31:31,583 --> 01:31:32,666
Please have a seat.

1327
01:31:34,750 --> 01:31:37,500
Who am I to stop you

1328
01:31:37,583 --> 01:31:40,791
when our prime minister
has given you permission?

1329
01:31:43,958 --> 01:31:45,833
Permission isn't the only issue here.

1330
01:31:47,583 --> 01:31:49,958
You also need to ensure
a smooth ride back home.

1331
01:31:53,541 --> 01:31:54,833
Are you threatening us?

1332
01:31:55,791 --> 01:31:57,791
What makes you think this is a threat?

1333
01:32:00,291 --> 01:32:03,458
It is such a big truck.
It could easily have an accident.

1334
01:32:03,541 --> 01:32:06,625
What if the roads are in bad shape?

1335
01:32:06,708 --> 01:32:08,666
There are innumerous possibilities.

1336
01:32:08,750 --> 01:32:11,708
If it moves even a little from its place,
it's gone forever.

1337
01:32:11,791 --> 01:32:14,833
It isn't a suitcase
that you can easily put back.

1338
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:19,625
So what do you want us to do?

1339
01:32:24,291 --> 01:32:27,250
First of all, ensure that
it causes no hindrance to anyone.

1340
01:32:27,333 --> 01:32:28,250
Okay, sir.

1341
01:32:28,333 --> 01:32:31,000
You'll need permission
for all the places you'll be passing,

1342
01:32:31,083 --> 01:32:32,250
irrespective of the time.

1343
01:32:32,333 --> 01:32:33,958
-Done, sir.
-Of course.

1344
01:32:34,041 --> 01:32:35,500
-Thank you.
-Hang on a second.

1345
01:32:37,666 --> 01:32:39,916
There's another condition
I haven't mentioned.

1346
01:32:44,041 --> 01:32:45,666
-That old hag of yours…
-Grandma.

1347
01:32:47,250 --> 01:32:48,666
She's my grandma.

1348
01:32:49,875 --> 01:32:50,791
Right.

1349
01:32:53,541 --> 01:32:56,125
She'll need to apologize to me.

1350
01:32:59,416 --> 01:33:03,250
She'll have to beg me for forgiveness.

1351
01:33:09,375 --> 01:33:12,250
-Listen to me. Talk to Sardar.
-He wasn't joking.

1352
01:33:12,333 --> 01:33:15,875
If he's in the mood to mess things up,
he won't let us take the house.

1353
01:33:15,958 --> 01:33:18,416
Sardar will never apologize
to that wrecker.

1354
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:20,500
At least try to convince her.

1355
01:33:20,583 --> 01:33:22,916
Surely she's apologized to someone before.

1356
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,458
You've met Sardar--

1357
01:33:25,041 --> 01:33:28,125
You haven't met her.
Sardar doesn't apologize to anyone.

1358
01:33:30,166 --> 01:33:33,041
-The whole family's like that?
-Radha, please don't drag--

1359
01:33:36,416 --> 01:33:39,000
Radha, my family. My family!

1360
01:33:39,625 --> 01:33:40,916
Family?

1361
01:33:44,208 --> 01:33:45,250
Hello, Pinky?

1362
01:33:45,333 --> 01:33:47,333
<i>Please forgive me, son.</i>

1363
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:52,916
<i>I didn't think twice</i>
<i>before lashing out at you.</i>

1364
01:33:54,541 --> 01:33:56,583
<i>Please take my age into consideration.</i>

1365
01:33:56,666 --> 01:34:00,625
<i>You are young, son. Do you want me</i>
<i>to hold my ears and apologize?</i>

1366
01:34:00,708 --> 01:34:02,666
<i>Here, I am sorry.</i>

1367
01:34:03,250 --> 01:34:06,166
<i>You should have just run away,</i>
<i>stayed out of my reach.</i>

1368
01:34:06,250 --> 01:34:08,833
<i>I am a mean old woman. Please forgive me.</i>

1369
01:34:10,791 --> 01:34:11,625
Okay.

1370
01:34:14,041 --> 01:34:15,500
Fine, I'll sign it.

1371
01:34:22,708 --> 01:34:25,083
Thank you. Let's go.

1372
01:34:29,333 --> 01:34:31,708
Sir, why did you
give them permission so easily?

1373
01:34:33,041 --> 01:34:34,875
He doesn't know anything, Safiq.

1374
01:34:36,208 --> 01:34:38,416
He is only inviting
more trouble for himself.

1375
01:34:40,291 --> 01:34:42,208
He's going to have a bad fall one day.

1376
01:34:43,833 --> 01:34:46,500
Both him and his house.

1377
01:35:02,125 --> 01:35:06,541
Hey, why are you breaking the antenna?
Just pull the cables out.

1378
01:35:06,625 --> 01:35:08,625
There are too many televisions
in the house.

1379
01:35:08,708 --> 01:35:09,791
And the Internet?

1380
01:35:09,875 --> 01:35:12,750
I spilled some water on the router
and destroyed its cables.

1381
01:35:12,833 --> 01:35:14,375
Have you lost it?

1382
01:35:14,916 --> 01:35:17,666
Internet works on Sardar's phone
even without the Wi-Fi.

1383
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:21,208
Sardar needs to have a phone
for the Internet to work.

1384
01:35:21,291 --> 01:35:23,250
Gurki, have you seen my phone?

1385
01:35:23,333 --> 01:35:25,000
-Oh, no. Let's go.
-What do we do?

1386
01:35:25,083 --> 01:35:28,250
-Your dog had your phone.
-He dropped it in his milk bowl.

1387
01:35:28,333 --> 01:35:30,083
We tried to dry it under the sun.

1388
01:35:30,166 --> 01:35:32,375
-We even used a dryer.
-We'll buy you a new one.

1389
01:35:32,458 --> 01:35:33,958
Why? It's under warranty.

1390
01:35:36,791 --> 01:35:40,583
As you can see,
they are widening the roads,

1391
01:35:40,666 --> 01:35:43,375
so they don't face any issues
bringing the house back.

1392
01:35:43,458 --> 01:35:46,833
-Speed up the work, guys.
-Sir, let me plan this through.

1393
01:35:46,916 --> 01:35:50,083
They have lost their minds.
This whole family is crazy.

1394
01:35:52,416 --> 01:35:53,750
-Wait.
-What is it?

1395
01:35:54,625 --> 01:35:55,916
That's a lot.

1396
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,166
I'm only following doctor's orders.

1397
01:35:58,250 --> 01:36:00,125
-Are all of you happy now…
-Yes.

1398
01:36:00,208 --> 01:36:01,875
…that you're getting something?

1399
01:36:01,958 --> 01:36:04,166
What is all this, Sardar?

1400
01:36:08,041 --> 01:36:11,833
And the bangles that I had kept aside
for Amreek's future wife?

1401
01:36:12,958 --> 01:36:14,791
-You can have them, Meenu.
-Okay, ma'am.

1402
01:36:14,875 --> 01:36:16,791
How did Amreek harm you?

1403
01:36:19,708 --> 01:36:24,041
I don't like anyone
who breaks his promise.

1404
01:36:25,625 --> 01:36:29,750
First it was your father,
then it was your son.

1405
01:36:31,458 --> 01:36:34,791
They broke their promises
and my heart too.

1406
01:36:41,666 --> 01:36:42,875
Too loud.

1407
01:36:42,958 --> 01:36:44,208
What do I do?

1408
01:36:44,291 --> 01:36:46,458
God help us all. Such a nuisance!

1409
01:36:47,291 --> 01:36:49,583
There's so much noise, Mom.
We can't study.

1410
01:36:49,666 --> 01:36:50,791
Can't help it, dear.

1411
01:37:17,208 --> 01:37:18,833
{\an8}-Are you blind?
-Sorry.

1412
01:37:18,916 --> 01:37:21,833
{\an8}-He broke my board.
-Sorry, I'll pay for the damage.

1413
01:37:21,916 --> 01:37:23,625
-Don't you get it?
-What's wrong?

1414
01:37:23,708 --> 01:37:25,041
We have guests at home.

1415
01:37:25,125 --> 01:37:27,791
We've trouble commuting
due to the obstacles you've caused.

1416
01:37:27,875 --> 01:37:29,916
You're doing this in front of my house…

1417
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,375
Bear with me.
I'm moving a house on a truck.

1418
01:37:32,458 --> 01:37:34,666
It's causing a lot of inconvenience.

1419
01:37:34,750 --> 01:37:37,875
-They broke the pipe.
-Where did that water come from?

1420
01:37:37,958 --> 01:37:39,250
What's going on, Radha?

1421
01:37:39,333 --> 01:37:40,916
Someone stop the water.

1422
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,041
Hey, why did you stop the water supply?

1423
01:37:43,125 --> 01:37:45,208
-I need sacks.
-Put that.

1424
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:48,833
Get me some sacks.

1425
01:37:48,916 --> 01:37:51,166
-It's my daughter's wedding.
-Where are the sacks?

1426
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:52,416
Go, go, go…

1427
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:54,666
Someone shut the mains off.
Stop the water.

1428
01:37:54,750 --> 01:37:56,833
You want more? You want more?

1429
01:37:56,916 --> 01:37:58,625
One more.

1430
01:38:09,291 --> 01:38:13,333
I told you to ensure that this does not
cause any inconvenience to anyone.

1431
01:38:16,416 --> 01:38:18,000
You have one hour.

1432
01:38:35,250 --> 01:38:36,291
Relax, Amreek.

1433
01:38:39,583 --> 01:38:40,416
Amreek, pipe.

1434
01:38:45,166 --> 01:38:47,250
Done, sir. Water pipe closed.

1435
01:38:47,333 --> 01:38:49,375
And gas diverted to Uncle Abdul.

1436
01:38:49,458 --> 01:38:51,625
And meter supply I have disabled also.

1437
01:38:51,708 --> 01:38:53,916
What are you staring at? Get back to work.

1438
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,041
My champ!

1439
01:38:56,125 --> 01:38:58,083
Let's get back to work, guys.

1440
01:39:02,041 --> 01:39:03,541
<i>-Kiddo.</i>
-I seek your blessings.

1441
01:39:03,625 --> 01:39:08,500
Sardar's pain is unbearable now.
She has refused to take any medicines.

1442
01:39:09,083 --> 01:39:10,583
<i>She's made our lives miserable</i>

1443
01:39:10,666 --> 01:39:13,833
because we've disconnected
her Internet and television.

1444
01:39:13,916 --> 01:39:20,125
I think we should tell her
that you are bringing her home back.

1445
01:39:20,208 --> 01:39:22,458
<i>Don't you dare. You will do no such thing.</i>

1446
01:39:22,541 --> 01:39:24,500
Things can still go wrong.
Say nothing.

1447
01:39:25,083 --> 01:39:27,958
Hand her the phone.
I'll talk to her. She'll listen to me.

1448
01:39:28,041 --> 01:39:30,083
Yes, I'll make her talk to you.

1449
01:39:30,166 --> 01:39:32,625
<i>That's better. Hurry up.</i>
<i>We can't chat on a video call.</i>

1450
01:39:32,708 --> 01:39:35,708
Disconnect and make an audio call
or she'll learn the truth.

1451
01:39:36,750 --> 01:39:37,708
Hello.

1452
01:39:38,750 --> 01:39:41,416
<i>-Put me on speaker.</i>
-Yes, I'll put you on speaker.

1453
01:39:42,333 --> 01:39:43,916
Here, talk to her.

1454
01:39:44,500 --> 01:39:49,041
Why don't you want to see my face?
Or is it that you can't show me your face?

1455
01:39:49,125 --> 01:39:53,000
Sardar, the Wi-Fi isn't working.
We cannot make a video call. Talk to him.

1456
01:39:53,083 --> 01:39:55,041
Hey, Sardar Kaur from Lahore.

1457
01:39:55,125 --> 01:39:58,000
I am coming back soon,
and I have a big surprise for you.

1458
01:39:58,750 --> 01:40:03,000
So you need to take your medicines.
Or you'll die before you see the surprise.

1459
01:40:03,083 --> 01:40:04,958
Right? So quickly take the medicine.

1460
01:40:06,750 --> 01:40:12,208
Well, he'll be the one
who'll be surprised when he returns.

1461
01:40:13,250 --> 01:40:15,291
I'll be long gone by then.

1462
01:40:15,375 --> 01:40:18,000
What are you doing, Sardar?
It's a new phone.

1463
01:40:18,666 --> 01:40:21,875
What good is it without the Internet!

1464
01:40:21,958 --> 01:40:24,208
Don't be ridiculous. Hello?

1465
01:40:28,916 --> 01:40:30,375
Please, go back.

1466
01:40:30,458 --> 01:40:32,000
Yeah, like that…

1467
01:40:32,083 --> 01:40:33,416
This is Sadia from NewsPak.

1468
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:36,125
They've begun
the process of moving the house.

1469
01:40:36,208 --> 01:40:38,958
It'll be lifted from the ground
and loaded on the truck.

1470
01:40:39,041 --> 01:40:42,000
It will then be carried
all the way to India.

1471
01:40:42,083 --> 01:40:43,791
Six hydraulic jacks--

1472
01:40:45,166 --> 01:40:48,875
Put the jack back in. Put it slowly.
Yeah, because even with--

1473
01:40:53,916 --> 01:40:56,750
-Is the angle an issue?
-Amreek, Radha. We're good to go.

1474
01:42:06,416 --> 01:42:09,000
The jack! How is it possible?

1475
01:42:09,083 --> 01:42:10,625
What's going on, Radha?

1476
01:42:11,708 --> 01:42:12,666
Be careful.

1477
01:42:12,750 --> 01:42:15,208
Get me the papers!

1478
01:42:15,291 --> 01:42:18,291
Calm down. What should we do now?
Everyone, calm down.

1479
01:42:18,375 --> 01:42:19,916
You guys do this every day.

1480
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,458
A hydraulic jack has failed.

1481
01:42:21,541 --> 01:42:24,458
Who do you think we are,
people who fix flat tires?

1482
01:42:25,250 --> 01:42:28,583
It's not our job to load
such a heavy thing on a truck.

1483
01:42:28,666 --> 01:42:29,625
Puncture!

1484
01:42:29,708 --> 01:42:31,666
-Get them all. Amreek!
-Where did he go?

1485
01:42:37,125 --> 01:42:38,500
-Amreek brother!
-Be quiet.

1486
01:42:39,333 --> 01:42:40,708
Side. Move aside.

1487
01:42:40,791 --> 01:42:43,875
-Keep it coming.
-Please give way.

1488
01:42:44,458 --> 01:42:46,583
Move aside. Keep it coming.

1489
01:42:47,583 --> 01:42:49,416
-Car jacks.
-Keep it coming.

1490
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:52,291
-How the hell does he plan to use that?
-Let's find out.

1491
01:42:52,375 --> 01:42:53,958
Get out of the way. Be careful.

1492
01:43:00,375 --> 01:43:02,333
Hey, don't go over there.

1493
01:43:08,916 --> 01:43:10,625
Move it to this side.

1494
01:43:12,833 --> 01:43:14,666
Balance. Move it slowly.

1495
01:43:14,750 --> 01:43:17,041
-Do it together.
-Now check the balance.

1496
01:43:17,125 --> 01:43:18,833
Hurry, before the house collapses.

1497
01:43:18,916 --> 01:43:20,500
You need to move it together.

1498
01:43:20,583 --> 01:43:22,083
Check the right one.

1499
01:43:22,708 --> 01:43:24,708
-Is it fixed?
-Wow.

1500
01:43:24,791 --> 01:43:25,958
What happened?

1501
01:43:26,041 --> 01:43:27,583
Is it balanced?

1502
01:43:33,083 --> 01:43:34,416
Yes.

1503
01:43:37,375 --> 01:43:38,708
Come.

1504
01:43:39,833 --> 01:43:41,000
Straight.

1505
01:43:41,083 --> 01:43:42,083
Keep it straight.

1506
01:43:42,166 --> 01:43:43,375
Yes, yes.

1507
01:43:44,916 --> 01:43:48,541
Come on, come on, come on.
Left, left, left.

1508
01:43:56,083 --> 01:43:57,708
Keep it coming.

1509
01:43:57,791 --> 01:44:00,291
Slow down, slow down.

1510
01:44:00,375 --> 01:44:02,500
Stop.

1511
01:44:04,375 --> 01:44:06,416
-Mack, load the house.
-All right.

1512
01:44:08,583 --> 01:44:09,583
Watch it!

1513
01:44:12,500 --> 01:44:15,208
-Take it slow. Take it slow.
-Be careful.

1514
01:44:34,458 --> 01:44:35,333
<i>Excellent!</i>

1515
01:44:35,416 --> 01:44:37,041
<i>Chasing the horizon</i>

1516
01:44:37,125 --> 01:44:38,041
<i>Excellent!</i>

1517
01:44:38,125 --> 01:44:39,583
<i>Going for the dream</i>

1518
01:44:39,666 --> 01:44:40,750
<i>Excellent!</i>

1519
01:44:40,833 --> 01:44:42,166
<i>Blessings all around</i>

1520
01:44:42,250 --> 01:44:43,458
<i>Excellent!</i>

1521
01:45:12,250 --> 01:45:14,458
What's this nonsense, DJ?

1522
01:45:14,541 --> 01:45:18,083
You've been at it for 30 minutes.
It's not working. My guests are coming.

1523
01:45:18,166 --> 01:45:20,750
They have a wedding at home.
Let's clear everything.

1524
01:45:20,833 --> 01:45:22,041
Let's go boys.

1525
01:45:22,833 --> 01:45:24,625
Stop chitchatting and come here.

1526
01:45:24,708 --> 01:45:27,291
-Where are the others?
-Come on.

1527
01:45:27,375 --> 01:45:29,666
-Lift it up.
-She's not going to pick it up.

1528
01:45:30,666 --> 01:45:32,541
-Lift it. Come on.
-Take it away.

1529
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,083
Come on, guys.

1530
01:45:35,166 --> 01:45:36,958
-Keep it over there.
-Keep it moving.

1531
01:45:37,041 --> 01:45:38,166
Get it out of there.

1532
01:45:40,166 --> 01:45:41,416
Listen.

1533
01:45:41,500 --> 01:45:43,166
-Yes?
-Invite them to the wedding.

1534
01:45:43,250 --> 01:45:44,250
Okay.

1535
01:45:59,583 --> 01:46:01,375
<i>Let me sit next to you</i>

1536
01:46:03,375 --> 01:46:05,708
<i>Have me sit close to you</i>
<i>Take me into your arms</i>

1537
01:46:07,208 --> 01:46:08,875
<i>Let me sit next to you</i>

1538
01:46:08,958 --> 01:46:10,916
<i>Have me sit close to you</i>
<i>Take me into your arms</i>

1539
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:14,708
<i>I think I am going to die without you</i>

1540
01:46:14,791 --> 01:46:17,125
<i>I am going to die…</i>

1541
01:46:18,125 --> 01:46:24,208
<i>I don't think I can</i>
<i>Stay away from you anymore</i>

1542
01:46:24,291 --> 01:46:28,083
<i>I don't think I can</i>
<i>Stay away from you anymore</i>

1543
01:46:28,166 --> 01:46:31,666
<i>I don't think I can</i>
<i>Stay away from you anymore</i>

1544
01:46:31,750 --> 01:46:36,416
<i>I don't think I can</i>
<i>Stay away from you anymore</i>

1545
01:46:36,500 --> 01:46:37,583
<i>Now check this out</i>

1546
01:46:45,041 --> 01:46:47,750
<i>Everyone's talking about your beauty</i>

1547
01:46:47,833 --> 01:46:50,500
<i>You are the talk of the town</i>

1548
01:46:50,625 --> 01:46:53,750
<i>Your beauty is enchanting</i>

1549
01:46:53,833 --> 01:46:57,291
<i>You are the talk of the town</i>

1550
01:46:57,375 --> 01:47:01,291
<i>You are the talk of the town</i>

1551
01:47:02,416 --> 01:47:07,791
<i>I don't think I can</i>
<i>Stay away from you anymore</i>

1552
01:47:07,875 --> 01:47:11,250
<i>I don't think I can</i>
<i>Stay away from you anymore</i>

1553
01:47:11,333 --> 01:47:15,208
<i>I don't think I can</i>
<i>Stay away from you anymore</i>

1554
01:47:15,291 --> 01:47:19,458
<i>I don't think I can</i>
<i>Stay away from you anymore</i>

1555
01:48:07,375 --> 01:48:09,541
How did you manage to get booze in Lahore?

1556
01:48:09,625 --> 01:48:10,916
One and only Chhote.

1557
01:48:11,916 --> 01:48:12,958
It's quite strong.

1558
01:48:13,541 --> 01:48:15,875
I can handle it. Strong.

1559
01:48:22,625 --> 01:48:24,166
Told you it's strong.

1560
01:48:24,250 --> 01:48:26,875
Niazi must have laced it with poison.
Don't drink it.

1561
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:29,500
It's locally made, right here in Lahore.

1562
01:48:29,583 --> 01:48:31,583
It takes some time to get used to it.

1563
01:48:32,333 --> 01:48:33,791
I'm loving it.

1564
01:48:34,375 --> 01:48:36,625
If you like it,
I'm sure Sardar will love it.

1565
01:48:37,041 --> 01:48:39,541
Local Pakistani liquor
might make her feel better.

1566
01:48:40,208 --> 01:48:42,291
I'll take some along for her. Pass it on.

1567
01:49:00,666 --> 01:49:01,791
-I'm sor--
-I'm sorry.

1568
01:49:06,125 --> 01:49:09,458
I'm sorry, Amreek. I was wrong about you.

1569
01:49:09,541 --> 01:49:11,708
I badmouthed you too.

1570
01:49:12,875 --> 01:49:14,625
You are boring, insane, crazy.

1571
01:49:14,708 --> 01:49:16,333
Yes, I am a little crazy.

1572
01:49:17,708 --> 01:49:18,541
Yes, you are.

1573
01:49:20,166 --> 01:49:21,875
But stay the way you are.

1574
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:26,333
Thank you for coming here.
I wouldn't be able to do it without you.

1575
01:49:26,416 --> 01:49:27,625
Please don't thank me.

1576
01:49:28,166 --> 01:49:31,666
I can't wait to see the look
on Sardar's face when she sees this house.

1577
01:49:31,750 --> 01:49:33,500
She'll go crazy with joy.

1578
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:37,750
Strange how people get so attached
to materialistic things.

1579
01:49:46,708 --> 01:49:48,083
It didn't break.

1580
01:49:48,166 --> 01:49:49,250
Dad.

1581
01:49:51,416 --> 01:49:52,375
Yes, Dad?

1582
01:49:52,458 --> 01:49:54,041
Come home immediately, kiddo.

1583
01:49:54,750 --> 01:49:56,875
Sardar doesn't have much time left.

1584
01:49:58,333 --> 01:49:59,916
I can't come without the house.

1585
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,541
She'll be heartbroken
if she doesn't see her house.

1586
01:50:02,625 --> 01:50:06,458
Try to understand, kiddo.
She is on a ventilator.

1587
01:50:06,541 --> 01:50:08,708
We don't know
if she'll open her eyes again.

1588
01:50:08,791 --> 01:50:12,916
<i>That house doesn't matter to me anymore.</i>
<i>Do you understand?</i>

1589
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:16,125
But it matters to Sardar.
It matters to me, Dad. It matters.

1590
01:50:16,208 --> 01:50:17,750
<i>Do you understand? It matters…</i>

1591
01:50:18,375 --> 01:50:20,541
Hello? Hello, Dad, it matters--

1592
01:50:29,541 --> 01:50:31,458
Hey, Sardar Kaur from Lahore.

1593
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:35,250
Look at me.

1594
01:50:36,333 --> 01:50:37,458
What's wrong with you?

1595
01:50:38,458 --> 01:50:40,750
Listen, get up.

1596
01:50:41,583 --> 01:50:44,166
I am coming back. Sardar!

1597
01:50:44,250 --> 01:50:46,291
<i>It's me, Amreek. Get up.</i>

1598
01:50:47,583 --> 01:50:48,958
<i>Please wake up.</i>

1599
01:50:49,708 --> 01:50:50,916
<i>Sardar?</i>

1600
01:50:55,166 --> 01:50:56,291
Kiddo…

1601
01:50:57,291 --> 01:50:59,291
doctors have already given up.

1602
01:51:01,041 --> 01:51:02,541
<i>Please come home immediately.</i>

1603
01:51:03,416 --> 01:51:08,666
Dad, she'll give everything to Lovely
if I come back without the house.

1604
01:51:08,750 --> 01:51:11,750
Everything has already
been transferred to Lovely.

1605
01:51:11,833 --> 01:51:15,791
Sardar has given everything to him.
Please just come home.

1606
01:51:15,875 --> 01:51:18,291
She might have transferred
everything to him for now,

1607
01:51:18,375 --> 01:51:21,500
but once I bring this house back,
she'll transfer everything to me.

1608
01:51:21,583 --> 01:51:23,500
She'll make me the CEO of the company.

1609
01:51:23,583 --> 01:51:26,458
Do you get it?
She'll make your son the CEO--

1610
01:51:28,041 --> 01:51:30,708
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

1611
01:51:32,041 --> 01:51:33,291
<i>Just come home.</i>

1612
01:51:33,375 --> 01:51:35,458
It's not what you think it is, Radha.

1613
01:51:35,541 --> 01:51:37,666
I was just saying it
to convince my father.

1614
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:43,833
Sardar is on ventilator
so he wants me to forget about the house,

1615
01:51:43,916 --> 01:51:46,083
and rush back to Amritsar.
This is not fair.

1616
01:51:48,458 --> 01:51:53,375
Radha, do you remember
the void you felt when we broke up?

1617
01:51:53,458 --> 01:51:56,166
I don't know how you felt,
but I certainly felt a void.

1618
01:51:56,250 --> 01:52:00,166
No matter where I went, whom I met,
what I did, I felt a void. It was empty.

1619
01:52:01,791 --> 01:52:04,208
Sardar has been
feeling that void for 70 years.

1620
01:52:04,291 --> 01:52:07,083
Seventy long years! Seventy years!

1621
01:52:09,041 --> 01:52:12,041
That void disappeared
when you came back into my life.

1622
01:52:12,833 --> 01:52:14,583
Everything went back to being okay.

1623
01:52:15,791 --> 01:52:20,125
I want Sardar to feel that way just once.

1624
01:52:20,208 --> 01:52:21,083
That's it.

1625
01:52:24,708 --> 01:52:26,250
I am here for Sardar.

1626
01:52:27,250 --> 01:52:28,958
I am here for her dream.

1627
01:52:33,333 --> 01:52:35,208
But you can assume whatever you want.

1628
01:52:37,375 --> 01:52:40,583
I didn't assume anything
that you assumed I am assuming.

1629
01:53:05,125 --> 01:53:08,916
Now no one can stop us
from taking our house back home.

1630
01:53:17,166 --> 01:53:19,833
Amreek had called to enquire.

1631
01:53:22,541 --> 01:53:26,041
All you can do is pray for her now.

1632
01:53:33,250 --> 01:53:35,375
Eighty kilometers, six hours.

1633
01:53:36,166 --> 01:53:37,208
Route fixed.

1634
01:53:38,166 --> 01:53:39,666
Let's do this.

1635
01:53:39,750 --> 01:53:41,125
Let's go back home now.

1636
01:53:41,208 --> 01:53:42,416
<i>Inshah allah.</i>

1637
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:43,541
-Amen to that.
-Come on!

1638
01:53:43,625 --> 01:53:46,250
Let's go. Come on, guys. Come on.

1639
01:53:47,791 --> 01:53:49,000
Please move that.

1640
01:53:51,166 --> 01:53:53,208
Someone please talk to him.

1641
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:56,833
-Chhote. Come here.
-Yes?

1642
01:53:57,791 --> 01:54:00,125
-Take this. Break it like this.
-Got it.

1643
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:08,208
<i>-Bismillah.</i>
-Amen.

1644
01:54:16,750 --> 01:54:19,750
Wait. Keep it coming.

1645
01:54:19,833 --> 01:54:21,541
Come, come, come.

1646
01:54:21,625 --> 01:54:25,041
Go slow. Balance.

1647
01:54:25,708 --> 01:54:27,166
-Come on, move!
-Slow.

1648
01:54:27,250 --> 01:54:29,541
Move back, everyone. Move aside.

1649
01:54:30,458 --> 01:54:32,666
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

1650
01:54:33,458 --> 01:54:34,333
Move back a little.

1651
01:54:34,416 --> 01:54:36,375
-It will catch fire.
-Move back?

1652
01:54:36,458 --> 01:54:40,083
There's a big problem.
He should have anticipated this.

1653
01:54:40,166 --> 01:54:43,125
A bunch of power cables
are obstructing the truck's path.

1654
01:54:44,750 --> 01:54:47,958
Amreek, these wires
could be dangerous for the house.

1655
01:54:48,041 --> 01:54:50,541
We need to do something.
We have to figure it out.

1656
01:54:53,041 --> 01:54:55,583
-The truck won't be able to pass.
-Switch it off.

1657
01:54:58,375 --> 01:54:59,625
-Chhote.
-Yes.

1658
01:54:59,708 --> 01:55:01,333
Switch off the main power supply here.

1659
01:55:01,416 --> 01:55:03,208
Okay, on it. Excuse me.

1660
01:55:03,291 --> 01:55:05,541
Give way, please. Excuse me.
Passing through.

1661
01:55:10,041 --> 01:55:12,625
-Could be something on that side.
-Please check.

1662
01:55:15,041 --> 01:55:17,916
Stay back. Stay back.

1663
01:55:19,083 --> 01:55:19,958
Chhote?

1664
01:55:28,125 --> 01:55:29,375
What's his problem now?

1665
01:55:29,458 --> 01:55:31,416
You cannot disconnect the power supply.

1666
01:55:44,166 --> 01:55:45,541
What's wrong, sir?

1667
01:55:45,625 --> 01:55:49,333
You think you can switch
the power off whenever you like?

1668
01:55:49,416 --> 01:55:52,375
I told you to ensure
this doesn't inconvenience anyone.

1669
01:55:53,625 --> 01:55:55,875
These things
take months to organize, mister.

1670
01:55:58,916 --> 01:56:03,541
This is the government,
not your grandma's pulse.

1671
01:56:04,833 --> 01:56:07,083
It doesn't speed up when it sees you.

1672
01:56:11,083 --> 01:56:13,791
Sir… Sir, please listen to me.

1673
01:56:13,875 --> 01:56:17,625
This won't take long.
I have already fulfilled your conditions.

1674
01:56:18,250 --> 01:56:20,750
Is this what I had asked for?

1675
01:56:23,333 --> 01:56:24,541
She is apologizing, sir.

1676
01:56:24,625 --> 01:56:27,416
To me? I am a dog?

1677
01:56:28,375 --> 01:56:29,333
Aren't you?

1678
01:56:33,291 --> 01:56:35,416
I guess the entire family has no manners.

1679
01:56:36,791 --> 01:56:39,541
Now this house
cannot go anywhere as long as I am alive.

1680
01:56:42,291 --> 01:56:44,291
You'll break my grandma's heart because…

1681
01:56:45,625 --> 01:56:47,250
she broke a bottle on your head?

1682
01:56:48,458 --> 01:56:50,125
Let us leave.

1683
01:56:51,083 --> 01:56:52,166
Chhote…

1684
01:56:55,750 --> 01:56:59,166
I don't care
about your grandma or her heart.

1685
01:57:00,541 --> 01:57:02,541
The sooner the old hag dies the better.

1686
01:57:02,625 --> 01:57:04,750
You…

1687
01:57:09,708 --> 01:57:13,625
You will apologize,
and your grandma will, too.

1688
01:57:29,458 --> 01:57:30,750
Stop.

1689
01:57:30,833 --> 01:57:32,166
-Let me go.
-No. Don't do it.

1690
01:57:32,250 --> 01:57:34,125
Control your emotions, young man.

1691
01:57:34,791 --> 01:57:36,333
-Look over there.
-Lift it.

1692
01:57:36,416 --> 01:57:37,875
Yes, I'm lifting it.

1693
01:57:37,958 --> 01:57:40,125
-Lift the wires carefully.
-Careful, Sadiq.

1694
01:57:43,833 --> 01:57:45,375
Lift it higher.

1695
01:57:51,333 --> 01:57:53,166
Lift it higher.

1696
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:01,291
That one.

1697
01:58:25,125 --> 01:58:27,625
Love is an emotion
that's way stronger than hatred.

1698
01:58:28,625 --> 01:58:30,125
Despite how mean you are,

1699
01:58:32,541 --> 01:58:34,708
the people of your country are very nice.

1700
01:58:36,708 --> 01:58:39,375
I am going
to take this house to my grandma.

1701
01:58:41,833 --> 01:58:43,708
Stop me if you can.

1702
01:58:45,333 --> 01:58:46,541
Goodbye.

1703
01:58:51,208 --> 01:58:52,875
Keep it coming.

1704
01:58:52,958 --> 01:58:55,000
Shall we leave, sir? Come on.

1705
01:59:00,958 --> 01:59:01,958
Let's do this.

1706
01:59:03,666 --> 01:59:04,541
One.

1707
01:59:06,500 --> 01:59:07,458
Two.

1708
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:12,625
Three. Lift the wires!

1709
01:59:21,375 --> 01:59:22,500
Stay back!

1710
01:59:22,583 --> 01:59:24,083
Come on, guys.

1711
01:59:24,166 --> 01:59:25,583
Keep it coming.

1712
01:59:25,666 --> 01:59:27,625
Keep it coming.

1713
01:59:27,708 --> 01:59:29,166
Lift it higher.

1714
01:59:30,500 --> 01:59:32,541
You'll get hurt. Please move back, sir.

1715
01:59:57,875 --> 01:59:59,541
Please move aside.

1716
01:59:59,625 --> 02:00:01,500
Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop.

1717
02:00:01,583 --> 02:00:03,416
I'm coming. Bye, guys.

1718
02:00:03,500 --> 02:00:06,750
-See you soon. Take care.
-Take the house back safe and sound.

1719
02:00:06,833 --> 02:00:08,208
See you soon. Let's go.

1720
02:00:08,291 --> 02:00:09,333
Bye.

1721
02:00:09,416 --> 02:00:12,375
-Where are you going?
-I'm coming along.

1722
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:14,041
Let's go.

1723
02:00:20,666 --> 02:00:22,000
Now remove it.

1724
02:00:22,083 --> 02:00:25,875
Keep it coming. Keep it coming.

1725
02:00:34,666 --> 02:00:39,916
<i>Life is slipping away</i>

1726
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:41,291
<i>The ground is melting</i>

1727
02:00:41,375 --> 02:00:42,791
This is a miracle.

1728
02:00:42,875 --> 02:00:47,875
<i>Your sun has no luster</i>
<i>Your shore is miles away</i>

1729
02:00:47,958 --> 02:00:52,208
<i>But you need to keep walking</i>
<i>You need to keep walking, my friend…</i>

1730
02:00:52,291 --> 02:00:53,541
You are racing ahead blindly.

1731
02:00:53,625 --> 02:00:57,916
There is a traffic jam
because of two cars colliding.

1732
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,041
<i>-After a lot of effort…</i>
-He did it.

1733
02:01:00,750 --> 02:01:02,333
-Please.
-Fine, let's go.

1734
02:01:02,416 --> 02:01:03,666
Let's go, guys.

1735
02:01:03,750 --> 02:01:07,708
<i>The blisters on your feet</i>
<i>Will be your guiding light</i>

1736
02:01:07,791 --> 02:01:12,500
<i>Stay determined and keep moving</i>

1737
02:01:12,583 --> 02:01:16,458
<i>Oh, mere mortal</i>
<i>God is with you</i>

1738
02:01:17,958 --> 02:01:23,583
<i>Oh, mere mortal</i>
<i>God is with you</i>

1739
02:01:35,708 --> 02:01:39,708
Everyone here is eagerly waiting
for Amreek Singh and his grandma's house,

1740
02:01:39,791 --> 02:01:43,541
to cross the border
and come back to their country.

1741
02:01:48,625 --> 02:01:49,625
Sardar,

1742
02:01:51,125 --> 02:01:53,500
Amreek is coming back with your house.

1743
02:01:57,458 --> 02:01:58,583
For you.

1744
02:02:03,041 --> 02:02:05,791
To complete your incomplete story.

1745
02:02:27,500 --> 02:02:28,500
For Sardar.

1746
02:02:39,500 --> 02:02:40,500
Bye.

1747
02:02:41,958 --> 02:02:42,958
Bye.

1748
02:03:59,375 --> 02:04:01,458
You said you'd be back on time.

1749
02:04:02,791 --> 02:04:05,000
What took you so long, huh?

1750
02:04:05,708 --> 02:04:06,750
Sorry, Sardar.

1751
02:04:08,541 --> 02:04:09,458
Please forgive me.

1752
02:04:10,458 --> 02:04:13,541
I won't need to apologize
after you see what I've brought you.

1753
02:04:15,125 --> 02:04:17,208
Gently Gently?

1754
02:04:17,291 --> 02:04:19,083
Yes, there's more.

1755
02:04:20,333 --> 02:04:21,250
What?

1756
02:04:23,708 --> 02:04:26,083
You are my favorite grandchild.

1757
02:04:34,750 --> 02:04:36,250
Come on now. Take a sip.

1758
02:04:43,875 --> 02:04:45,375
-Sardar!
-Sardar!

1759
02:04:46,666 --> 02:04:50,208
It tastes just like the liquor

1760
02:04:50,291 --> 02:04:53,000
your grandfather used
to give me back then.

1761
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,541
-Are you sure this is the one?
-Yes.

1762
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,708
Then I guess Gursher Singhji
was a cunning storyteller.

1763
02:05:03,291 --> 02:05:05,791
He gave you
locally distilled Pakistani liquor

1764
02:05:05,875 --> 02:05:08,083
and not some stolen imported stuff.

1765
02:05:08,166 --> 02:05:11,166
You went to Pakistan without me?

1766
02:05:13,458 --> 02:05:15,291
I'd gone there to get you something.

1767
02:05:23,375 --> 02:05:26,958
LAHORE TO AMRITSAR - ACROSS BORDERS

1768
02:05:47,166 --> 02:05:51,166
Hey, Sardar Kaur,
that's your home from Lahore.

1769
02:05:52,500 --> 02:05:53,750
I had made you a promise.

1770
02:05:55,375 --> 02:05:57,166
How could I possibly not fulfil it?

1771
02:05:58,750 --> 02:06:00,625
Would you like to take a closer look?

1772
02:06:01,458 --> 02:06:02,416
Come.

1773
02:08:20,791 --> 02:08:24,666
Gursher Singhji,
would you please try this on?

1774
02:08:45,500 --> 02:08:46,791
Come on.

1775
02:09:15,750 --> 02:09:19,083
It feels like I've been waiting
for you for ages.

1776
02:10:11,458 --> 02:10:14,500
<i>Sardar! Open the door!</i>

1777
02:10:15,208 --> 02:10:17,375
<i>What are you waiting for? Break the door!</i>

1778
02:10:17,458 --> 02:10:19,291
-Come on.
-No…

1779
02:10:19,375 --> 02:10:22,875
I have never refused you anything.
Please don't act stubborn today.

1780
02:10:22,958 --> 02:10:24,541
Come what may, do not step out.

1781
02:11:45,250 --> 02:11:48,125
I wasn't so bad.

1782
02:11:50,458 --> 02:11:54,125
You shouldn't have
broken your promise, Gursherji.

1783
02:11:55,416 --> 02:11:58,291
I wasn't so bad.

1784
02:11:58,375 --> 02:12:00,625
I wasn't so bad.

1785
02:12:01,250 --> 02:12:04,458
You shouldn't have
broken your promise, Gursherji.

1786
02:12:19,875 --> 02:12:20,958
Rupinder?

1787
02:12:30,750 --> 02:12:33,458
It is not right
to break your promise, Gursher Singhji.

1788
02:12:35,291 --> 02:12:37,000
Why did you leave me?

1789
02:12:39,125 --> 02:12:40,583
Why didn't you take me along?

1790
02:12:42,791 --> 02:12:47,791
How else would
all your dreams come true, Rupinderji?

1791
02:12:50,833 --> 02:12:55,708
Our children, their children,
Champion Cycles.

1792
02:12:56,750 --> 02:13:01,833
Whatever, but there's no one
who can match up to you.

1793
02:13:03,541 --> 02:13:04,500
I swear.

1794
02:13:05,625 --> 02:13:08,125
There's no one like you either.

1795
02:13:09,291 --> 02:13:10,333
I swear.

1796
02:13:36,208 --> 02:13:38,125
Come on. Time for a family picture!

1797
02:13:38,208 --> 02:13:40,708
-Come on, they're clicking a picture.
-Hurry up, Dad.

1798
02:13:40,791 --> 02:13:42,125
<i>I guess they were right.</i>

1799
02:13:42,208 --> 02:13:44,625
<i>The house did add a few years</i>
<i>to Sardar's life.</i>

1800
02:13:44,708 --> 02:13:45,791
Stop arguing, ladies.

1801
02:13:45,875 --> 02:13:47,041
<i>After seeing her house,</i>

1802
02:13:47,125 --> 02:13:50,416
<i>Sardar kept taunting me</i>
<i>for another seven years,</i>

1803
02:13:50,500 --> 02:13:52,541
<i>and then left us to join her Gursherji.</i>

1804
02:13:52,625 --> 02:13:54,541
Say that to your mother.

1805
02:13:54,625 --> 02:13:56,041
<i>When Sardar passed away,</i>

1806
02:13:56,125 --> 02:13:59,166
<i>she divided her property</i>
<i>into three equal parts.</i>

1807
02:14:00,083 --> 02:14:02,416
<i>In the end,</i>
<i>all of us had become her favorite.</i>

1808
02:14:03,666 --> 02:14:06,833
<i>I got married to Radha</i>
<i>and went back to America.</i>

1809
02:14:07,958 --> 02:14:10,875
<i>I have two daughters and a son</i>
<i>whom we call Sardar.</i>

1810
02:14:10,958 --> 02:14:12,250
Cheese!
