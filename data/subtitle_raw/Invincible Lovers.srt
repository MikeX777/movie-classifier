INVINCIBLE LOVERS

2
00:01:20,191 --> 00:01:23,168
On August 11th Vassilis escaped
from the orphanage

3
00:01:23,288 --> 00:01:26,393
to go back to his grandmother,
at the village...

on my honor I will...</i>

00:03:38,697 --> 00:03:42,247
He traveled by truck at night
all the way to Isthmus.

a brand new flame...</i>

12
00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:44,137
<i>...I'll go first, even if I break
my heart to pieces...</i>

13
00:05:44,903 --> 00:05:48,476
<i>...I'll be the first to go so I'll take
all the blame...</i>

14
00:05:48,596 --> 00:05:50,756

16
00:06:48,036 --> 00:06:49,402
No-no!

17
00:06:51,642 --> 00:06:53,257
Adder and whip snake!

18
00:06:56,698 --> 00:06:57,530
No!

20
00:07:09,114 --> 00:07:10,046
Welcome!

21
00:07:10,778 --> 00:07:13,579
- Whose are you?
- Panos Apostolopoulos' (son).

22
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:15,697
- Where to?
- To my grandma.

23
00:07:15,817 --> 00:07:16,908

Why are you not talking to me?

27
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:59,331
You know if there's a garage around?

28
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,714
A phone number perhaps?

29
00:14:26,727 --> 00:14:27,913
Hey, listen...

30
00:14:30,184 --> 00:14:31,192
Listen...

31
00:14:35,605 --> 00:14:37,649
All right, thank you very much.

00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:38,607
'Bye.

33
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,433
Go on, sleep.

34
00:17:06,502 --> 00:17:09,024
I'll just sit here and not talk to you.

35
00:17:22,293 --> 00:17:24,235
I watched a film last night.

36
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,642
My husband, the woman said,

37
00:17:29,021 --> 00:17:32,528
is a gambler, a scoundrel, a burglar,
a swindler.

38
00:17:34,394 --> 00:17:35,378
One night

39
00:17:36,185 --> 00:17:38,102
he got a bullet in the eye.

40
00:17:38,614 --> 00:17:41,817
Ah, says the man who listened,
is he blind now, then?

41
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,576
No, she says, he's dead.

42
00:18:25,955 --> 00:18:27,696
Are you from this town?

43
00:18:30,887 --> 00:18:31,720
Nah...

44
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:37,573
Well, save your breath,
don't talk so fast...

45
00:20:47,805 --> 00:20:49,748
- This one.
- Have a seat.

46
00:21:45,302 --> 00:21:46,917
How far are you going?

47
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,852
I'm going very far, got it?

48
00:23:24,015 --> 00:23:25,075
Addio, miss.

49
00:27:00,602 --> 00:27:02,065
There we go again...

50
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,329
Morning!

51
00:27:22,693 --> 00:27:23,626
Welcome.

52
00:27:29,165 --> 00:27:31,386
- And you'll have?
- A chocolate.

53
00:27:31,506 --> 00:27:33,404
Ah, that's too little money.

54
00:27:34,438 --> 00:27:36,885
You'll have a lokum (Turkish delight).

55
00:27:38,297 --> 00:27:39,382
No, thanks.

56

60
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,781
You won't talk?

61
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:08,026
Hey, listen...

62
00:29:26,104 --> 00:29:27,033

63
00:29:28,445 --> 00:29:29,999

64
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:32,759
Come, I'll take you there!

65

67
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:06,067
It's the truth!

68

Enter.

78
00:37:30,507 --> 00:37:32,385
Won't you kiss your sister?

79
00:38:02,368 --> 00:38:06,849
I would suggest you stayed for the night
but we're leaving on holiday tomorrow.

80
00:38:07,152 --> 00:38:08,181
Come here.

81

Vassilis, my boy, what will you have?
Spoon sweet?

85
00:39:02,325 --> 00:39:03,637
Some ice-cream?

86
00:39:04,558 --> 00:39:06,456
What shall I get you, then?

87
00:39:06,576 --> 00:39:08,090

88
00:39:22,219 --> 00:39:23,410

89
00:39:24,015 --> 00:39:27,043

for quite some time now.

91
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:51,164

92
00:39:52,355 --> 00:39:53,202

96
00:40:13,004 --> 00:40:14,658
I read about a new film

97
00:40:14,778 --> 00:40:18,250
where an angel falls in love and
wants to become a mortal.

98
00:40:19,099 --> 00:40:23,396
So they say that, this angel can only
be seen by the audience and children.

99
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:26,969
The audience for sure.

100
00:40:29,124 --> 00:40:30,778
Yes, because children...

101
00:40:30,898 --> 00:40:33,624
when you're facing a child
you feel that...

102
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:36,470
someone is actually by you.

103
00:41:34,355 --> 00:41:35,727

00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:38,795

how to give her...
