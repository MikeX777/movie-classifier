00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,700
THE HOUND OF BASKERVILLE

2
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,001
It's as if this dice shaker
is jinxed in my hand.

3
00:03:18,602 --> 00:03:20,102
Twelve!

4
00:03:21,803 --> 00:03:26,703
I won't catch up with that.
12 eyes?  That's too much.

5
00:03:27,804 --> 00:03:31,604
Twelve eyes are too few for the
man who has a beautiful wife.

6
00:03:32,105 --> 00:03:35,505
To admire her?
-No, to guard her?

7
00:03:40,206 --> 00:03:45,306
What would you do with a man
you knew were stealing from you?

8
00:03:45,807 --> 00:03:48,907
If he were a small man,
I would have him whipped.

9
00:03:49,808 --> 00:03:52,608
And if it concerned a large thief?

10
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:57,609
Then I would send him on a voyage from
which he would never return.

11
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:03,110
What's that?  Watch out.  Someone
has already seduced your wife.

12
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:08,911
Who knows that?  -The medallion that you
guarded like the virtue of your wife.

13
00:04:09,612 --> 00:04:12,312
Sir Bettans is carrying it
under his jacket.

14
00:04:13,613 --> 00:04:15,313
How do you know?

15
00:04:15,414 --> 00:04:20,914
When James, Sir Bettans's servant, is drunk,
he says more than his master would like.

16
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,115
Sir Bettans!

17
00:04:46,216 --> 00:04:52,316
Miserable boy!  I should have had the
dog chase you from the castle long ago.

18
00:04:53,517 --> 00:04:55,517
Now, you'd better believe I will!

19
00:05:33,518 --> 00:05:36,618
Now to you, wife.

20
00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:41,419
You won't drive me away.
I'll see to that.

21
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,120
Kill me.  I'd be thankful
for this one good deed.

22
00:05:46,521 --> 00:05:49,021
You gave up the right
to me a long time ago.

23
00:05:49,322 --> 00:05:51,522
Every hour at your
side was torture.

24
00:05:52,123 --> 00:05:56,423
I only abided it so long because I saw
my duty as more important than love.

25
00:05:56,924 --> 00:06:04,124
I was faithful to you, but you trampled my
love with your feet.  Destroyed my life.

26
00:06:04,825 --> 00:06:08,625
Until Sir Bettans came.
He made life worthwhile again.

27
00:06:09,226 --> 00:06:12,426
Yes, I gave him my heart.

28
00:06:42,127 --> 00:06:46,427
You believe this old
ghost story?

29
00:06:46,928 --> 00:06:49,428
This fairytale about this hound
from Baskerville?

30
00:06:49,829 --> 00:06:51,929
Only because it's written
in your family chronicle?

31
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,530
Besides, the story is
200 years old.

32
00:06:56,431 --> 00:06:58,231
I have to believe in it.

33
00:06:59,032 --> 00:07:03,332
One always hears it, this
howling of the dog

34
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,833
that walks across the moor.
-Nonsense.

35
00:07:06,234 --> 00:07:08,234
I have explained it
to you so often.

36
00:07:08,535 --> 00:07:11,335
The sounds must be coming from
the morass holes.

37
00:07:11,836 --> 00:07:17,836
Caused by sinking mud and
rising water, or from somewhere.

38
00:07:27,437 --> 00:07:31,537
It follows all of us who
are named Baskerville.

39
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:35,838
Pfft, it follows all of us who
live here on the moor.

40
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,339
I can't fathom it.

41
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:58,140
A man like you, who is always poised, gets
nervous and overwrought by these noises.

42
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:06,241
Lord Charles, as a doctor I'm telling you.
It's high time you got away from here.

43
00:08:06,742 --> 00:08:08,442
London would do you good.

44
00:08:09,043 --> 00:08:11,243
There are no dogs
howling there.

45
00:08:11,344 --> 00:08:15,244
There's a flight, where you'll have
the company of pretty women.

46
00:08:16,345 --> 00:08:22,645
Pretty women?  -Lord Charles,
I know what you're missing here, eh?

47
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:26,546
This time it was only
a young woman.

48
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,647
See, I was right.  A carriage
has pulled up.

49
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,348
A woman has gotten out.

50
00:08:49,049 --> 00:08:50,549
A woman?

51
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,850
Is Lord Baskerville available?

52
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,051
Please report my arrival.  My
name is Beryl Vendeleure.

53
00:09:14,552 --> 00:09:16,052
Vendeleure?

54
00:09:17,553 --> 00:09:19,753
That name is familiar.

55
00:09:20,954 --> 00:09:23,154
A side branch of our family.

56
00:09:25,155 --> 00:09:26,655
I'm sorry.

57
00:09:37,496 --> 00:09:43,356
Milord is sorry.  -Lord Baskerville will
regret it.  I must speak with him.

58
00:09:44,057 --> 00:09:46,657
Tell him I beg of him to
see me tonight.

59
00:09:46,758 --> 00:09:50,258
Milord doesn't wish...
-Listen, announce me again!

60
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,659
Pardon me, Milord, but the
lady won't be dissuaded.

61
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,760
She says she must speak with
the lord today.

62
00:10:03,961 --> 00:10:08,361
A Miss or Mrs. Vendeleure?
-She only said her name.

63
00:10:08,862 --> 00:10:10,362
Beryl Vendeleure.

64
00:10:16,863 --> 00:10:18,963
OK, let her in.

65
00:10:22,064 --> 00:10:24,364
Strange visit, so late at night.

66
00:10:26,165 --> 00:10:33,865
Vendeleure.  I'm not thrilled.  Someone
by that name was in prison.

67
00:10:38,066 --> 00:10:43,066
You will be surprised, Lord Baskerville.
To force my way in at such late an hour.

68
00:10:43,667 --> 00:10:48,967
Surprised yes, but pleased.
Dr. Mortimer.

69
00:10:50,468 --> 00:10:54,068
My butler said you wanted
to speak to me urgently.

70
00:10:55,469 --> 00:10:57,469
Can I help you in some way?

71
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:01,470
Yes, please.  It concerns...

72
00:11:03,971 --> 00:11:08,071
I was in the area. You might
know that we own land around here.

73
00:11:08,272 --> 00:11:12,072
No.  -Yes, the piece of land
adjacent to yours belong to us.

74
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:17,073
I thought, what if I offered
to sell it to you?

75
00:11:17,374 --> 00:11:20,574
Maybe you have...  -But that's nothing
more than a worthless moor.

76
00:11:20,675 --> 00:11:23,775
Yes.  Sadly, I had to be
convinced of that.

77
00:11:24,376 --> 00:11:28,076
But because the carriage that was taking
me back to the train station was passing

78
00:11:28,077 --> 00:11:33,977
by here, I remembered that we Vandeleures
are distantly related to the Baskervilles.

79
00:11:34,378 --> 00:11:36,878
Regrettably, yes.
-What do you mean?

80
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:40,379
I mean, regrettably only distantly.

81
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,780
One would rather be closely
related to a pretty woman.

82
00:11:48,481 --> 00:11:52,681
I only have a few minutes.
-Out of the question.  It's stormy.

83
00:11:52,982 --> 00:11:57,082
You would arrive in London in the middle
of the night.  So stay with us overnight.

84
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,783
Actually, I wanted to be back
by this evening already.

85
00:12:00,084 --> 00:12:02,584
How long have you been here?
-Since noon today.

86
00:12:02,985 --> 00:12:05,485
I only wanted to be away
from London for half a day.

87
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:14,086
Why are you unpacking the suitcases?
-The lady said she's staying here.

88
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,787
I don't know if I should accept your
invitation to stay overnight.

89
00:12:30,988 --> 00:12:32,688
It's unexpected.

90
00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:37,389
The vanity of women.  Three suitcases
for half a day.

91
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:41,790
I thought I might find a prospective buyer.
-You have one already.

92
00:12:41,991 --> 00:12:44,991
For my moor property?
-No, for you.

93
00:12:48,792 --> 00:12:50,592
What's that?

94
00:12:55,793 --> 00:12:58,893
It's just the moor.
-It sounds so eerie.

95
00:13:05,294 --> 00:13:08,394
Pardon me, Milord, which
room for the lady?

96
00:13:08,495 --> 00:13:11,295
The room with the bay window.
-Very well, Milord.

97
00:13:17,996 --> 00:13:22,596
You, will see, Miss Vandeleure, in the
light of day the castle isn't eerie.

98
00:13:24,297 --> 00:13:26,197
If only the nights weren't.

99
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:29,498
Lord Charles is a little high-
strung, nervous.

100
00:13:31,499 --> 00:13:34,299
Mr. Stapleton.
-If I may.

101
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,900
Our dear neighbour.
Beware of him.

102
00:13:46,301 --> 00:13:50,601
He's an embittered woman-hater. He
eats women down to their skin and hair

103
00:13:50,702 --> 00:13:52,502
Miss Beryl Vendeleure.

104
00:13:56,903 --> 00:14:01,703
Look how sharply he glares at her.  -No, no,
that's only because I can't see well.

105
00:14:02,604 --> 00:14:07,004
I have the impression that
the lady is very pretty.

106
00:14:09,005 --> 00:14:11,505
But that must be a
mistake.  I'm mean,

107
00:14:11,506 --> 00:14:14,206
how does a pretty woman
end up in this eerie castle?

108
00:14:14,907 --> 00:14:18,107
Where are my glasses?
-You're holding them.

109
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,208
No, that's the one for distance.
Oh, I see.

110
00:14:21,609 --> 00:14:23,609
Ah, here is the one for close-up.

111
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:29,110
Yes, she is pretty.

112
00:14:33,811 --> 00:14:35,511
And she's staying!

113
00:14:37,312 --> 00:14:41,012
Get away from here as quickly
as you can, otherwise in short order

114
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:45,913
you'll be as ugly and unearthly as this
castle, as me, as him, as Lord Charles.

115
00:14:46,214 --> 00:14:48,814
I find Lord Charles neither
unearthly nor ugly.

116
00:14:49,115 --> 00:14:51,915
Then it's high time for you
to acquire glasses.

117
00:15:00,216 --> 00:15:03,916
Forgive me.  The suitcase
slipped out of my hands.

118
00:15:06,817 --> 00:15:10,817
If I am to accept your offer to stay
then I must retreat to my room now.

119
00:15:14,218 --> 00:15:17,618
May I serve dinner in half an hour?
-Please, yes.

120
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,619
A pretty woman, no?  Even you
must admit that, Stapleton.

121
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,320
What are you looking for?

122
00:15:33,521 --> 00:15:35,221
Found it.

123
00:15:37,822 --> 00:15:40,822
Best way to get rid of
a pretty woman.

124
00:15:42,823 --> 00:15:44,523
I'm leaving.

125
00:15:46,424 --> 00:15:50,024
This house was a hospitable one
as long as no women were here.

126
00:15:51,225 --> 00:15:56,125
When a woman is here,
there's hate, discord, etc.

127
00:15:56,826 --> 00:15:59,226
I'll leave this for you.
-What is this?

128
00:15:59,527 --> 00:16:03,327
You'll need this.  An elixir for gall
ailments.  He laughs.

129
00:16:03,628 --> 00:16:05,128
You know why he's laughing?

130
00:16:05,429 --> 00:16:08,429
Because he prescribed this for me and
he knows very well it's useless.

131
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:15,230
Perfume, a woman in the house.
No, it doesn't suit me.

132
00:16:16,131 --> 00:16:17,731
I'm going.
-I'll accompany you.

133
00:16:17,732 --> 00:16:21,032
Are you going too, Doctor?
-Yes.  You won't need me anymore today.

134
00:16:21,133 --> 00:16:24,033
You have more amusing company.  Come,
Doctor.  Goodnight.  -Goodnight.

135
00:16:34,734 --> 00:16:37,034
Is our guest happy with her room?

136
00:16:37,435 --> 00:16:41,235
The lady didn't have the courtesy
to share her opinion with me.

137
00:16:42,536 --> 00:16:46,936
Set the table for two, but somewhat
friendlier than usual, with flowers.

138
00:16:47,337 --> 00:16:50,737
With flowers?
-Yes, with flowers!

139
00:16:51,038 --> 00:16:55,938
Why are you repeating that?  -I'm not
repeating, Milord.  I just said with flowers.

140
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:07,039
The woman is good medicine for our Lord.
-I don't like her.

141
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:11,040
Why not?  She's pretty.
-Yes, she's pretty, but she's a woman.

142
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:13,041
Why are you a misogynist?

143
00:17:14,442 --> 00:17:18,342
There!  The siren is
from Princetown Prison.

144
00:17:18,543 --> 00:17:21,343
Some poor devil is trying
to escape again.

145
00:17:21,444 --> 00:17:24,244
Won't get far.  The moor
swallows all of them.

146
00:17:24,445 --> 00:17:30,545
But they try again and again.  Run with a
deathly fright and scamper over the wall.

147
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,846
How about the pillow?

148
00:18:25,747 --> 00:18:27,547
Light.

149
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,148
Yes.  Yes, I'm on the phone.

150
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:54,549
Here?  What?

151
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,150
I don't have time right now.

152
00:18:59,151 --> 00:19:00,651
What?!

153
00:19:01,452 --> 00:19:02,952
No!

154
00:19:03,753 --> 00:19:05,853
That can't be true!

155
00:19:08,454 --> 00:19:13,754
What?  Oh, OK, good.
Come right away.

156
00:19:15,055 --> 00:19:17,555
Hello?  Hello!

157
00:19:19,956 --> 00:19:21,756
Madam, don't interrupt me!

158
00:19:22,257 --> 00:19:23,857
Yes, you interrupted me!

159
00:19:24,358 --> 00:19:27,758
I won't tolerate this tone!
Dumb person!

160
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,859
Lord Charles was just here.

161
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,260
Did he leave the house?
-Milord will surely be right back.

162
00:20:10,761 --> 00:20:13,261
Schmidt, Milord is out here
in the garden!

163
00:20:14,562 --> 00:20:17,662
I'm sorry, I thought
you were alone.

164
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,763
I would suggest the lady
not come into the garden.

165
00:20:29,164 --> 00:20:32,064
Why not?  -There are tripping
hazards and booby traps.

166
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:34,865
I beg you.  Stay here!

167
00:20:35,366 --> 00:20:39,366
The castle is very secluded.  Lord
Baskerville doesn't abide dogs here.

168
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:43,667
You see, there's an old story.
-Yes, yes, I know that tale.

169
00:20:44,168 --> 00:20:48,468
Of course, you don't believe it,
but there's something to it.

170
00:20:49,469 --> 00:20:50,969
Yes, yes.

171
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:08,970
Jack, Jack, you have to help me!
-How did you get here?

172
00:21:09,871 --> 00:21:13,071
I'd best leave you guessing.  But they're
searching for me everywhere!

173
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:16,372
You have to help me!  -I don't want to
have anything to do with you.

174
00:21:18,873 --> 00:21:21,673
No, Jack, you have to help me!

175
00:21:22,074 --> 00:21:26,174
I have the right to demand it.
You can't leave me in the lurch.

176
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:54,675
Barrymore, what's with
Lord Charles?

177
00:21:55,376 --> 00:21:57,576
Did you not hear that?
It came from that direction.

178
00:21:58,877 --> 00:22:01,377
No, I didn't hear a thing.
-There was a scream!

179
00:22:02,078 --> 00:22:05,378
You are mistaken.
-It was Lord Baskerville!

180
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:19,379
OBITUARY

181
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,380
Please fetch Miss Vandeleure.

182
00:22:50,381 --> 00:22:51,681
Yes?

183
00:22:53,782 --> 00:22:55,982
Dr. Mortimer would like to see you.

184
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:14,783
Well, how are you?  Is it better?
-Thanks, it's better.

185
00:23:15,984 --> 00:23:18,484
May I begin with the reading
of the will?  -Yes, please.

186
00:23:18,985 --> 00:23:20,785
Then let's begin, My Lordship.

187
00:23:32,306 --> 00:23:36,286
...and declare herewith that the rightful
heir of the title and the property of

188
00:23:36,287 --> 00:23:40,387
Baskerville is the son of my late brother,
who currently lives in Paris,

189
00:23:40,488 --> 00:23:42,988
the engineer Henry Rogers.

190
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:48,189
I leave with my heirs the duty to provide
my old friend, Dr. Mortimer, an annual

191
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:53,490
pension of 200 Pounds, and to give my loyal
servant, Barrymore, a one-time payment

192
00:23:53,491 --> 00:23:55,291
of 1000 Pounds.

193
00:23:56,492 --> 00:23:59,492
Lord Charles had a nephew.
We didn't know that.

194
00:23:59,993 --> 00:24:03,993
A nephew?  That is very surprising.

195
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:08,594
The will is properly signed and
confirmed by two witnesses.

196
00:24:09,295 --> 00:24:14,795
Lord Baskerville, an engineer
currently living in Paris!

197
00:24:16,196 --> 00:24:18,896
Are we going to Grimpen right away?
-I'd like to stay one more day in London.

198
00:24:18,897 --> 00:24:20,697
In which hotel?
-Well, what do you suggest?

199
00:24:20,698 --> 00:24:23,598
Maybe Northumberland, Mayfield,
Victoria...  -It doesn't matter to me.

200
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:24,799
Northumberland is on the way.

201
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,100
I thank you, dear Doctor, that you picked
me up at the train station.  -Oh, gladly.

202
00:24:28,901 --> 00:24:32,401
Did you have a comfortable trip?
-Oh yes.  Exceptional.

203
00:24:33,202 --> 00:24:36,502
It was of course a big shock for me.
-Yes, for us too.

204
00:24:36,703 --> 00:24:42,403
You must know that it is hard to relate to
all the grief.  I hardly knew my uncle.

205
00:24:43,204 --> 00:24:46,004
He died of a heart attack, right?
-Yes, yes.

206
00:24:46,205 --> 00:24:47,705
How, so suddenly?

207
00:24:48,106 --> 00:24:51,406
Well, I always feared it.
He died from fright.

208
00:24:52,107 --> 00:24:56,107
From fright?  Of what?
-He feared a ghost.

209
00:24:56,308 --> 00:25:00,008
The hound of Baskerville.  -He
believed in that?  -Yes.

210
00:25:00,009 --> 00:25:03,409
And I believe in it too.
Wait, don't laugh, Lord Henry.

211
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:06,010
There's something strange going on
in this castle.

212
00:25:06,311 --> 00:25:09,911
That's why I sought a man today who might
be able to shine a light on the situation.

213
00:25:10,012 --> 00:25:13,312
And who is he?
-A certain Sherlock Holmes.

214
00:25:13,713 --> 00:25:17,613
Oh, the famous detective?
Well, he probably laughed at you.

215
00:25:17,714 --> 00:25:20,714
I haven't met him yet.  I'm supposed
to go back this morning.

216
00:25:20,915 --> 00:25:22,815
Then he'll laugh at you
this morning.

217
00:25:24,016 --> 00:25:27,016
Do you want to stay here too?
-No, thank you.  I live with my sister.

218
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,617
I'd like a room.
-Certainly.

219
00:25:28,618 --> 00:25:30,918
OK, then I guess I can leave.

220
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:33,819
Or should I wait?  Don't you want to
come with me, Lord Henry?

221
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:38,120
Oh, no no no.  -All right, then, goodbye,
Mr. Baskerville.  -Goodbye.

222
00:25:38,221 --> 00:25:41,621
Pardon me, Lord Baskerville?  -Yes?
-A letter was left here for you.

223
00:25:41,922 --> 00:25:45,122
For me?  Impossible.
-"To Lord Henry Baskerville"

224
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:52,023
Nobody knew you were
coming here.

225
00:25:53,124 --> 00:25:56,824
"Charing Cross"
-That's about two hours from Baskerville.

226
00:26:02,425 --> 00:26:04,425
Charing Cross, Charing Cross...

227
00:26:09,626 --> 00:26:12,126
"If you value your life,
you'll stay away from the moor."

228
00:26:12,427 --> 00:26:15,027
Somebody doesn't put much
worth on my presence.

229
00:26:15,228 --> 00:26:17,428
Who could have sent this letter?

230
00:26:17,629 --> 00:26:20,729
Probably the Hound of
Baskerville personally.

231
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:22,930
Room 47.
-Thank you.

232
00:26:23,531 --> 00:26:25,731
Are you sure you don't want to come with
me, Lord Henry?  -No, no, no, my dear

233
00:26:25,732 --> 00:26:27,932
Doctor.  I can deal
with ghosts myself.

234
00:26:28,733 --> 00:26:30,733
Your Sherlock Holmes can
busy himself with that.

235
00:26:38,284 --> 00:26:39,734
Mr. Holmes?

236
00:26:41,235 --> 00:26:42,735
Mr. Holmes?

237
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:47,236
He still hasn't come.  I've been waiting
for two nights.  That makes me very nervous.

238
00:26:47,237 --> 00:26:50,237
Mr. Watson!  What am I supposed
to think?  Mr.  Watson!

239
00:26:50,938 --> 00:26:54,138
Oh, for goodness sake!
-Close the door!  The ash will fly away.

240
00:26:55,339 --> 00:26:59,339
Is it that tragic?  You don't have to sweep
it up.  You're not ordinarily neat anyway.

241
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,540
What do you say, Mr. Watson?

242
00:27:02,541 --> 00:27:06,141
Mr. Holmes still isn't back.  5...8
containers you have in this room, and

243
00:27:06,142 --> 00:27:07,572
the ashes are all
over the place!

244
00:27:07,573 --> 00:27:10,073
Have you gone crazy?
I have to examine these ashes!

245
00:27:10,374 --> 00:27:12,174
117 different types.

246
00:27:12,275 --> 00:27:16,075
What kind of crazy things you do!
For what?  You smoked all this yourself.

247
00:27:16,376 --> 00:27:18,376
Whatever you do, don't get sick.

248
00:27:18,577 --> 00:27:22,577
Do you have any idea how sick
I am already?  -Me too.

249
00:27:22,578 --> 00:27:25,278
What, you smoked?
-Brazilian.

250
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,579
-It's a disgrace that you're
ruining the young man.

251
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,080
Quite the opposite.  He
will never smoke again.

252
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:34,081
By the way, don't stand around.  Help me
a bit.  Have a smoke and study the ash.

253
00:27:34,782 --> 00:27:36,782
You must have lost your mind!

254
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:42,183
Mr. Holmes is here!

255
00:27:42,284 --> 00:27:46,284
Good that you're here.  I was so worried.
-But I knew it right away.

256
00:27:46,485 --> 00:27:49,285
Mrs. Garben, tea, sandwich, and
a hot bath, please.

257
00:27:50,886 --> 00:27:54,286
Good that you're finally here.
We were all very worried.

258
00:27:54,587 --> 00:27:56,387
Those were two awful days.

259
00:27:57,088 --> 00:28:01,088
But the gems that were stolen from the
Vatican are now on their way to Rome.

260
00:28:01,189 --> 00:28:06,389
But you said it was a hopeless case.
-Yes, but my first suspicion was right.

261
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:12,490
What's this cane?
-A certain Dr. Mortimer forgot it here.

262
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:15,491
Godright said he wanted to talk
to you.  He's come back later.

263
00:28:15,592 --> 00:28:18,192
So, my first suspicions led me
to George Baynor.

264
00:28:20,993 --> 00:28:23,253
He's a country doctor.
-Who, George Baynor?

265
00:28:23,554 --> 00:28:25,354
No, this Dr. Mortimer.

266
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:28,655
A country doctor.  How
did you conclude that?

267
00:28:28,956 --> 00:28:31,856
Because in the city one doesn't use
a cane with an iron tip.

268
00:28:31,957 --> 00:28:34,757
Holmes, this Dr. Mortimer
could also be a judge.

269
00:28:34,758 --> 00:28:38,658
No.  People go to a judge.
A country doctor goes to the people.

270
00:28:38,859 --> 00:28:40,959
You can tell by the
timeworn iron tip.

271
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:44,260
See what you can find out about Dr.
Mortimer in the doctors' registry.

272
00:28:45,661 --> 00:28:48,661
As I said, I went to George Baynor.

273
00:28:48,962 --> 00:28:51,962
He has a dog.  A big,
powerful dog.

274
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:56,063
Who, George Baynor?
-No, this Mortimer fellow.

275
00:28:56,664 --> 00:28:59,664
How did you conclude that?
-The cane has big notches in the middle

276
00:28:59,765 --> 00:29:01,765
from a big dog's teeth.

277
00:29:02,165 --> 00:29:06,565
Hey, there are two Dr. Charles Mortimers.
One in London, and one in Grimpen.

278
00:29:06,566 --> 00:29:09,566
Dr. Charles Mortimer.
-What's new in Grimpen?

279
00:29:09,667 --> 00:29:11,267
Good day.

280
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:15,968
My friend and colleague, Dr. Watson.
Feel free to speak in his presence.

281
00:29:16,469 --> 00:29:17,869
Before I speak with you,

282
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:23,070
I would like you to read a part of
the Baskerville family chronicle.

283
00:29:23,071 --> 00:29:27,571
No.  Mr. Holmes is much too tired.  Can
you not tell us the matter in brief.

284
00:29:27,972 --> 00:29:32,672
Can it really be explained?  The unnerving,
the unexplainable story gets lost.

285
00:29:32,873 --> 00:29:36,473
It concerns an old legend
from the 16th century,

286
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:39,574
about a huge dog that tore apart the
lord of the castle.

287
00:29:40,475 --> 00:29:42,200
And why should I read this story?

288
00:29:42,201 --> 00:29:45,501
Because events have been happening
recently at the Baskerville Castle

289
00:29:46,602 --> 00:29:49,002
that frighteningly remind
one of the old legend.

290
00:29:49,903 --> 00:29:52,903
The ghost of the dog is roaming.
-Have you seen it?

291
00:29:53,604 --> 00:29:59,504
Seen?  No.  But one often hears an odd
howling on the moor at night.

292
00:29:59,805 --> 00:30:01,805
And the howling is
from the ghost dog?

293
00:30:01,806 --> 00:30:06,006
You believe.  -Me?  No, but Lord
Baskerville believed in it.

294
00:30:07,007 --> 00:30:10,307
And the fear sent him to his death.
He died of a heart attack.

295
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,008
His corpse lay in the garden.

296
00:30:12,009 --> 00:30:15,609
And, gentlemen, I saw
that myself.  It was raining.

297
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:19,510
Next to the corpse I found the
tracks of an enormous dog.

298
00:30:19,811 --> 00:30:24,311
This is your cane, right?
-Yes, thank you.  I forgot it here.

299
00:30:24,412 --> 00:30:32,212
If this is your cane, then you have a
large...roster of patients.

300
00:30:32,313 --> 00:30:35,913
You make a lot of house calls, walk across
the land.  The iron tip is all worn out.

301
00:30:36,014 --> 00:30:39,714
You are a country doctor, right?  We saw
it right away.  -Astonishing!

302
00:30:39,915 --> 00:30:43,715
Who, in ancient times, could have
had a motive to kill Lord Baskerville?

303
00:30:44,216 --> 00:30:47,816
No one.  -Really?  Didn't the lord
have heirs?  -No.

304
00:30:48,117 --> 00:30:52,617
That is, to our surprise, it turns out
he had a nephew, who worked for years

305
00:30:52,618 --> 00:30:57,218
in Paris as an engineer, and who is, as the
next of kin, the next Lord Baskerville.

306
00:30:57,319 --> 00:30:59,119
I picked him up from
the train station today.

307
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,320
At the hotel, something
strange happened.

308
00:31:02,521 --> 00:31:06,521
The desk clerk handed Lord Baskerville a
letter that had been dropped off for him.

309
00:31:06,922 --> 00:31:08,722
What's unusual about that?

310
00:31:08,723 --> 00:31:12,723
No one knew in which hotel
Lord Baskerville would be staying.

311
00:31:15,224 --> 00:31:18,924
"If you value your life, you'll
stay away from the moor."

312
00:31:19,325 --> 00:31:23,125
The words and letters have been cut
out of a newspaper.

313
00:31:23,226 --> 00:31:25,426
Probably, judging by the letters.

314
00:31:26,627 --> 00:31:28,927
Surely from The Times.
-Mrs. Garben!

315
00:31:29,928 --> 00:31:33,928
10 to 1 they are from The Times.
-We know that!  -Well, OK then!

316
00:31:35,229 --> 00:31:36,829
Sunshine.

317
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:43,030
Was the room in the Northumberland
reserved for Lord Baskerville beforehand?

318
00:31:43,531 --> 00:31:47,731
No.  He decided to stay there on
the way from the train station.

319
00:31:48,132 --> 00:31:51,632
Corporal, here.  -Look up the hotels
I will write down for you right away.

320
00:31:51,833 --> 00:31:55,833
And ask everywhere if a letter for Lord
Henry Baskerville was dropped off.

321
00:31:55,934 --> 00:31:57,934
So, a letter for Lord
Henry Baskerville.  OK.

322
00:31:58,435 --> 00:32:02,335
And what did the lord say when the clerk
gave him this bizarre letter?

323
00:32:02,536 --> 00:32:04,536
Well, nothing.  He
laughed about it.

324
00:32:04,737 --> 00:32:09,037
He leaves the impression of a level,
easy-going, very calm person.

325
00:32:09,238 --> 00:32:14,038
Well, that's great!  That a single shoe
vanishes.  A brand new shoe.

326
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:17,939
I'm sorry, but I unpacked the shoes and
put them there.  -Yeah, right!

327
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,940
I swear.
-I saw it too.

328
00:32:20,041 --> 00:32:24,141
Did the shoe vanish into thin air?
Pardon.  You called.  How can I help?

329
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:28,342
A pair of shoes were unpacked.
Brand new shoes.  And one is gone.

330
00:32:28,343 --> 00:32:30,343
What can I do with one shoe?
Am I a stork?

331
00:32:30,444 --> 00:32:33,544
Why, that's not possible.
-Maybe someone stole it.

332
00:32:33,545 --> 00:32:35,545
Don't talk nonsense!  What's a
person to do with one shoe?

333
00:32:35,546 --> 00:32:37,546
The shoe must by
all means be found.

334
00:32:37,547 --> 00:32:41,047
You have 20 minutes.  Otherwise
this'll be my last time in your hotel.

335
00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:49,548
Excuse me, sir, I found your other
shoe.  It was on the staircase.

336
00:32:49,949 --> 00:32:51,749
Well then!

337
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:55,850
Then everything is in order.
Excuse me, please.

338
00:32:57,051 --> 00:32:57,851
Please.

339
00:32:58,252 --> 00:33:00,752
Miss Henry would have come into
consideration as an heir.

340
00:33:00,753 --> 00:33:03,853
Probably so, if the direct heir
hadn't surfaced.

341
00:33:04,054 --> 00:33:06,200
How did the lady behave
when the will was read?

342
00:33:06,201 --> 00:33:07,701
She was shocked, shaken,

343
00:33:07,702 --> 00:33:11,902
and stayed at the castle even though
she had planned to leave that night.

344
00:33:12,103 --> 00:33:14,200
And for what reason did she stay?
-She claimed

345
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:16,101
she had hurt her foot
and couldn't walk well.

346
00:33:16,201 --> 00:33:18,901
Ah!  -What could I have done?
-But you could have quickly examined it.

347
00:33:18,902 --> 00:33:21,502
I did, but I didn't
find anything.

348
00:33:21,603 --> 00:33:24,503
Who, of all these people, was given a
bequest in the will?

349
00:33:24,504 --> 00:33:29,304
The servant, Barrymore.  1000 pounds.
-See, that's important.  Everyone

350
00:33:29,305 --> 00:33:32,505
who was endowed a bequest in the
will is suspicious.

351
00:33:32,706 --> 00:33:36,306
Lord Charles left me an annual
pension of 200 pounds.  I wouldn't...

352
00:33:36,307 --> 00:33:39,507
No, no, I didn't mean to say that,
for God's sake.

353
00:33:39,608 --> 00:33:43,588
Mr. Holmes, there was a letter for Lord Henry
Baskerville in all the hotels you gave me.

354
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:48,189
But they didn't give them to me.
-I can imagine.  You don't look like a lord.

355
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:49,991
Why not?
-Look in the mirror.

356
00:33:49,992 --> 00:33:52,692
Well, how does a lord look?
-Like me.  -Aha.

357
00:33:53,593 --> 00:33:57,993
Yes, hello?  What's that.  Yes,
Dr. Mortimer is here.  Doctor, for you.

358
00:33:58,694 --> 00:34:01,594
Yes, this is Dr. Mortimer.  Oh, it's
you, Lord Henry.

359
00:34:02,195 --> 00:34:03,995
Yes, what can I do for you?

360
00:34:04,296 --> 00:34:07,696
A shoe?  That is peculiar.

361
00:34:09,097 --> 00:34:13,697
And for that reason you're changing hotels?
-That's the second in a very short period.

362
00:34:14,598 --> 00:34:17,098
The first were brand new.
One was found, after all.

363
00:34:17,499 --> 00:34:19,999
And now a used tennis shoe.

364
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,700
Excuse me.  The shoe is nowhere
to be found.

365
00:34:22,901 --> 00:34:24,901
As if it disappeared from
the face of the earth.

366
00:34:25,202 --> 00:34:29,202
Nowhere to be found.  No, no, no, dear
Doctor.  This is laughable.  I'm moving out!

367
00:34:29,903 --> 00:34:35,403
Say, Doctor, do you know another good hotel?
-Yes, of course.  Hotel Victoria is excellent.

368
00:34:35,804 --> 00:34:38,304
Yes, then I'll see you again
in Hotel Victoria.

369
00:34:41,805 --> 00:34:46,005
The new shoe was brought back,
but the old one was stolen?

370
00:34:47,306 --> 00:34:49,850
Watson, I think this case is beginning
to get interesting.

371
00:34:49,851 --> 00:34:53,300
Are you going to drive there?
-No, I have no time.  You'll drive there.

372
00:34:53,401 --> 00:34:54,901
What am I to do there?
-Yes, what's he going to do?

373
00:34:55,002 --> 00:34:59,002
He shall see to it that the Hound of
Baskerville gets the right collar.

374
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:17,103
Over there is the moor.  It
goes for 15 miles.

375
00:35:17,704 --> 00:35:19,904
I didn't know it was that pretty.

376
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,905
Yes, it's nice.  But dangerous.
Very dangerous.

377
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,906
The moor!  Come help me!

378
00:35:45,307 --> 00:35:47,807
Something seems to have
happened again over there.

379
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:13,208
You were lucky.
-It was a close call.  I almost drowned.

380
00:36:13,509 --> 00:36:15,709
It's not worth the risk to find
the guy we're after.

381
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:18,610
Who is it?
-Someone broke out of Princetown Prison.

382
00:36:18,911 --> 00:36:22,111
I'm sure he's dead.  The moor swallowed
him.  -Yes, I think so too.

383
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:26,512
Yes, yes, the area is dangerous.  As
you see, I didn't overstate it.

384
00:36:26,713 --> 00:36:30,913
The Moor...Hello, Stapleton.  You're
about to meet a funny guy.

385
00:36:31,114 --> 00:36:32,914
He catches butterflies?
-He's a naturalist.

386
00:36:33,015 --> 00:36:36,315
Ah, Stapleton!  Lord Henry, this
is our friend Stapleton.

387
00:36:36,516 --> 00:36:38,716
In nice weather you won't see
me without a butterfly net.

388
00:36:38,717 --> 00:36:44,217
It would be a sin to be without a net.
I caught a lovely zyclopedus (?).

389
00:36:44,818 --> 00:36:47,018
Show us the creature later.
Come on, get in.

390
00:36:53,019 --> 00:36:56,119
Greetings to you, Mr. Watson.
-How do you know me?

391
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,320
Firstly, I saw your picture
recently in a newspaper.

392
00:36:59,721 --> 00:37:03,021
And secondly, your right should is
somewhat scuffed.

393
00:37:03,222 --> 00:37:07,222
That indicates that you always fight
shoulder-to-shoulder with Sherlock Holmes.

394
00:37:07,523 --> 00:37:11,323
And thirdly, your name
is on your suitcase.

395
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,324
This is Barrymore.

396
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:30,725
You won't hold it against me if I
go home.  My wife is awaiting me.

397
00:37:30,826 --> 00:37:33,926
Well, then I don't want to hold you
up.  Goodbye, dear Doctor.

398
00:37:34,427 --> 00:37:37,127
Many thanks.

399
00:37:42,128 --> 00:37:43,628
Let's go.

400
00:37:52,429 --> 00:37:54,629
For sure not a merry house.

401
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:00,930
I can understand that one believes
in ghosts if one lives here.

402
00:38:01,631 --> 00:38:05,231
Right, Doctor?  Well, some things
are going to change here.

403
00:38:05,612 --> 00:38:10,132
Milord, my wife and I would be happy to stay
here until you have decided on changes.

404
00:38:11,133 --> 00:38:13,000
Are you saying that
you want to leave?

405
00:38:13,101 --> 00:38:15,701
We were heartbroken by
Lord Charles's death,

406
00:38:15,702 --> 00:38:19,402
and we will not be happy as long as
we are living at Baskerville Castle.

407
00:38:19,903 --> 00:38:21,903
Well, what do you
want to do?

408
00:38:22,004 --> 00:38:25,204
Lord Charles's generosity gave us the
means to open a store.

409
00:38:26,505 --> 00:38:30,205
But if you insist on us staying here...
-We'll talk about it another time.

410
00:38:33,506 --> 00:38:37,506
I find it strange that the man wants to go.
-It almost looks like flight.

411
00:38:39,807 --> 00:38:44,707
I know the real reason.
There's a woman in the house.

412
00:38:45,508 --> 00:38:47,808
But this woman will not be
here much longer.

413
00:38:49,509 --> 00:38:51,809
I only awaited your
arrival, Lord Henry.

414
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:55,510
Tomorrow I'm leaving.
-I would be saddened.

415
00:38:56,811 --> 00:39:00,611
Let me introduce.  Dr. Wat...
-My name is Parker.

416
00:39:00,812 --> 00:39:03,012
I will now play the housewife
a bit and show

417
00:39:03,013 --> 00:39:06,813
the master of the house and Mr... -Joe,
er... P-Parker.  -...Mr. Parker the rooms.

418
00:39:06,913 --> 00:39:08,913
Very friendly.

419
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:13,714
Since I have been in the house you
haven't shown your face, Mr. Stapleton.

420
00:39:14,715 --> 00:39:17,415
But hopefully you haven't forgotten
where the whiskey bottle is.

421
00:39:17,516 --> 00:39:19,016
No.

422
00:39:19,917 --> 00:39:22,517
But you have forgotten something.
-What's that?

423
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:27,818
You have forgotten to limp.
-I'm doing much better today.

424
00:39:28,819 --> 00:39:32,619
You see, I hurt my foot.
-Yes, Dr. Mortimer told me of that.

425
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:38,420
Will you take the room with the bay
window, Lord Henry?  -Gladly, thanks.

426
00:39:43,921 --> 00:39:47,521
And for you, the room next door
is possible, Mr...  -Peinter.

427
00:39:48,122 --> 00:39:54,622
Earlier you said Parker.  -Yes, Parker-
Peinter or Peinter-Parker.  However you like.

428
00:39:56,223 --> 00:39:59,023
May I set a place for Mr. Stapleton?
-Absolutely.

429
00:39:59,024 --> 00:40:03,124
Can't leave that boy...can't leave that
boy alone with that woman.

430
00:40:03,825 --> 00:40:07,925
If I understand it right, Mr. Stapleton
believes...  -Yes, I believe that.

431
00:40:08,226 --> 00:40:10,426
Sadly, that is also my opinion.

432
00:40:10,927 --> 00:40:14,727
And, um, what's the basis
of your suspicion?

433
00:40:15,128 --> 00:40:19,528
On the night of the reading of the will, Mrs.
Vandeleure cried for hours in her room.

434
00:40:19,729 --> 00:40:23,229
Why was she crying?  What do you think?
-Disappointment.  A poor relative.

435
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:27,530
Nobody thought Lord Charles
had any remaining next of kin.

436
00:40:27,631 --> 00:40:29,831
And how was it that you heard
Mrs. Vandeleure crying?

437
00:40:30,132 --> 00:40:34,132
I was eavesdropping at the door.
-Ugh, disgusting.  -Excuse me.

438
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:40,333
Ugh, disgusting...

439
00:40:42,534 --> 00:40:45,234
Just leave it, Barrymore.  I'll unpack
the suitcase myself.  -Very well.

440
00:40:46,335 --> 00:40:50,335
It must be unpacked right away.  Otherwise
everything will be squashed  -Let me do it.

441
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,736
Please leave it to me.  I'm happy
to be occupied.

442
00:40:54,637 --> 00:40:58,037
It's so boring for me here.
-Why did you you stay here then?

443
00:40:58,338 --> 00:41:00,938
Well, I'm looking for an opportunity.

444
00:41:01,139 --> 00:41:03,639
I thought maybe I could
be useful at this time.

445
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,240
May I ask what you have been
doing with your life heretofore?

446
00:41:06,741 --> 00:41:09,941
Model, but I have no talent
or enthusiasm for it.

447
00:41:10,542 --> 00:41:12,042
But who asks for that?

448
00:41:12,943 --> 00:41:16,043
I have no other choice.  Tomorrow
I'm leaving.  -Why that?

449
00:41:16,344 --> 00:41:18,444
Because you haven't
invited me to stay.

450
00:41:18,545 --> 00:41:22,745
Of course.  It would be my pleasure to have
such a charming, pretty lady as a guest...

451
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:27,046
if she wants to.  -I'll accept the
compliment and the invitation, Lord Henry.

452
00:41:27,447 --> 00:41:29,047
And thank you.
-I thank you!

453
00:41:29,248 --> 00:41:34,448
Well, what is that?  Ink?  -Nice.
Aha, the ink pen!

454
00:41:34,949 --> 00:41:37,949
Too bad about the suit.  I don't
think it can be saved.

455
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:40,450
I'll try anyway.
-It's an old suit.  Throw it away.

456
00:41:40,551 --> 00:41:46,251
It's not all that bad.  Barrymore
will be happy.  But it's a pity.

457
00:41:46,952 --> 00:41:49,252
Do you have any other
requests of your housemaid?

458
00:41:49,353 --> 00:41:52,953
No.  -If it's OK with you, I'll have
dinner served in one hour.

459
00:41:53,154 --> 00:41:56,154
Please do.  -Be punctual.
-Absolutely.

460
00:41:57,055 --> 00:41:59,555
You, too, Mr. Parker.

461
00:42:05,756 --> 00:42:09,856
That's astounding!  -Isn't she nice?  I've
just hired her as a housemaid.

462
00:42:09,957 --> 00:42:12,557
Oh, that's wise of you.
-But she's really very nice.

463
00:42:13,458 --> 00:42:16,958
Nice, but dangerous.
-To the contrary.  dangerous but nice.

464
00:42:17,659 --> 00:42:19,659
By the way, do you
have any suspicions?

465
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:23,560
For the moment, everything lies in
front of me as if in a deep fog.

466
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,961
Mr. Holmes, we found nothing
about these moors.

467
00:42:33,562 --> 00:42:37,762
In Grimpener Moor, there are well-
preserved caves, in which our stone-age

468
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:42,863
antecedents dwelled.  The Neolithic
period doesn't interest you, right?

469
00:42:44,164 --> 00:42:45,864
Let me see.

470
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,865
Lord Henry.

471
00:45:58,813 --> 00:46:01,866
It's you?  What's the deal with
the light signal?

472
00:46:02,167 --> 00:46:03,808
I...I gave a light sig...

473
00:46:03,809 --> 00:46:09,809
Ah, Barrymore gave some and
someone on the moor answered him,

474
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:11,310
and...

475
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:16,011
You really gave me a bad blow.
-I'm sorry, but someone knocked on my door.

476
00:46:16,112 --> 00:46:18,512
That was me.
-When I came out, no one was there.

477
00:46:18,613 --> 00:46:23,013
That was me, too.  I went after
Barrymore to see what he...

478
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:26,514
We have to go outside to the moor right
away.  -Now, in the middle of the night?

479
00:46:26,916 --> 00:46:29,716
We'll have time in the morning.
-No, something must be happening.

480
00:46:29,917 --> 00:46:32,417
But no, come on and go to sleep.

481
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,318
May I serve breakfast?

482
00:46:50,019 --> 00:46:54,919
Tell me, Barrymore, why do you prowl
around at night with a lantern?

483
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:01,820
Mr. Parker, I do a security check
of the house every night.

484
00:47:02,521 --> 00:47:04,721
To make sure everything
is in order.

485
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:08,522
Good of you to be so
diligent.  That's good.

486
00:47:10,023 --> 00:47:11,823
Good morning.  The newspaper.

487
00:47:12,024 --> 00:47:15,224
Hey, young friend, come in.  Does that
boy bring the newspaper every day?

488
00:47:15,325 --> 00:47:18,525
Yes, he picks it up at the train station.
By mail it would come much later.

489
00:47:20,126 --> 00:47:22,426
Good morning.  A weekly paper.
-Thanks.  Here.

490
00:47:22,527 --> 00:47:26,227
Well, boy, how's business going?
-Business isn't going, but I go a lot.

491
00:47:27,128 --> 00:47:31,628
How long do you think it takes me to
deliver my 46 Timeses every day?

492
00:47:31,729 --> 00:47:34,229
46 papers?  You don't sell more?
-No.

493
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:39,230
Well, the lady here in the house bought
10 newspapers at once the other day.

494
00:47:39,531 --> 00:47:41,831
She at least has a sense
for business stimulation.

495
00:47:42,232 --> 00:47:46,632
Wait!  Which lady?
-There is only one lady in the house.

496
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:50,933
10 Timeses, and all from the same day?
-Maybe she wants to wallpaper her room.

497
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:53,634
How did you get that idea?
-I'm supposed to bring her glue.

498
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,635
Well, goodbye.
-Goodbye.  10 Timeses?

499
00:47:56,936 --> 00:47:59,436
Miss Beryl seems to be
writing threatening letters.

500
00:48:01,037 --> 00:48:03,937
Ah, Barrymore.  When does
Miss Beryl get up?

501
00:48:04,438 --> 00:48:06,438
Very early.
-Is she up already?

502
00:48:06,739 --> 00:48:10,639
She went riding with Lord Henry an hour
ago to view the estate.

503
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:14,140
Lord Henry is out of the house?
Without telling me?

504
00:48:22,001 --> 00:48:24,788
And what does Mr. Parker think?
-Why does that interest you?

505
00:48:24,989 --> 00:48:29,689
Because I find him very nice, this
Mr. Parker.  Nice, but dangerous.

506
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:32,690
Yes, he spoke very admiringly of you.
-Really?

507
00:48:33,191 --> 00:48:36,891
He thinks you have especially good hearing.
-That must be a holdover from my career.

508
00:48:36,992 --> 00:48:39,092
As model?
-No, as a telephone operator.

509
00:48:39,093 --> 00:48:43,693
Oh, you were also a telephone operator?
-Yes, but this is my first time as a maid.

510
00:48:43,894 --> 00:48:48,894
I think you love the variety.  -No, the
variety loves me, and never lets me rest.

511
00:48:49,495 --> 00:48:52,595
Even though I love a calm life, and
have never had it.

512
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:57,896
I have always had it, and I crave
change, adventure, and excitement.

513
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:14,897
Stop.  Who are you?
-I'm Dr. Watson.

514
00:49:15,398 --> 00:49:16,698
I live in Baskerville Castle.

515
00:49:16,699 --> 00:49:18,899
Perhaps you are looking for a
man and woman on horseback.

516
00:49:18,899 --> 00:49:21,699
I am worried...
-You don't have to be scared of horses.

517
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,300
If he stopped on the moor
he is no longer alive.

518
00:49:24,601 --> 00:49:29,301
We have searched the whole thing.  -We're
withdrawing.  No sense hanging around.

519
00:49:29,902 --> 00:49:32,202
Excuse me.

520
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:37,903
You think he shot at us?  -At us?  At you,
Lord Baskerville.  You have to leave here.

521
00:49:38,104 --> 00:49:42,404
You are in danger.  That's why I sent you
the letters.  In London, all the hotels.

522
00:49:42,505 --> 00:49:45,105
That was you?
-I wanted to warn you.

523
00:49:45,506 --> 00:49:49,506
Yes, but what made you do that?
-I was scared.

524
00:49:50,007 --> 00:49:53,007
No Baskerville is safe here.
-What should I make of that?

525
00:49:53,708 --> 00:49:55,908
Don't ask.  Leave right away.

526
00:50:00,109 --> 00:50:04,109
Ah, Lord Henry!  Miss Vandeleure!
Did my dog bark at you?

527
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:10,210
Anyway, what are you doing here?
-Staying busy.  I have to visit a patient.

528
00:50:11,511 --> 00:50:14,811
Well, I'd better be going.  Otherwise
I'll scare the horses.

529
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:16,812
Goodbye.

530
00:50:21,313 --> 00:50:25,513
The fishie swam in the little stream,
and was so big and fat.

531
00:50:26,014 --> 00:50:30,214
In a moment it'll swim in the pan,
and then it becomes a fish cutlet.

532
00:50:37,815 --> 00:50:40,515
Mr. Stapleton!  Mr. Stapleton!

533
00:50:44,816 --> 00:50:47,416
Mr. Watson.  -Hello.
-To what do I owe this pleasure?

534
00:50:47,417 --> 00:50:50,117
Have you seen Lord Henry or
Miss Vandeleure?  -No, why?

535
00:50:50,118 --> 00:50:52,618
Because I'm worried about them.
There was a gunshot in the woods.

536
00:50:52,919 --> 00:50:58,219
A shot rang out, hey, hey!  Who shot out
there?  Is my little rabbit scared?

537
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:02,820
Don't make jokes.  Come with me.
-And the leprechauns will fry my fish, huh?

538
00:51:06,921 --> 00:51:10,221
So, what's wrong with the Lord and his
Lady?  Did they disappear together?

539
00:51:10,222 --> 00:51:14,322
You think the worst right away  -Cut the
jokes.  Show me the way to the woods.

540
00:51:15,623 --> 00:51:18,523
Go up onto the roof and you'll see the
forest.  All the way to the moor.

541
00:51:18,624 --> 00:51:21,224
Now come with me.  I don't
know my way around here.

542
00:51:21,225 --> 00:51:23,725
Please.  There are the stairs.

543
00:51:23,926 --> 00:51:26,926
Do you see them?  -Of course I do.
-Go up them.

544
00:51:27,027 --> 00:51:31,427
17 steps.  You can handle that, can't you?
Climb to the roof.  I'll be right there.

545
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:48,028
Here's to our rescue.

546
00:51:48,229 --> 00:51:50,429
To your rescue, Lord Henry.

547
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:58,130
I have the feeling that I'm safe
as long as you're around.

548
00:51:58,431 --> 00:52:02,531
Well, who knows?
-Yes, nothing nasty.

549
00:52:02,832 --> 00:52:06,332
You have that much trust in me?
-Unconditional trust.

550
00:52:07,433 --> 00:52:09,633
You must stay with me Beryl, OK?

551
00:52:10,534 --> 00:52:12,234
What is that?

552
00:52:12,735 --> 00:52:15,235
The shot.  Are you hurt?

553
00:52:15,636 --> 00:52:18,736
Boy, it was a close call.
-Are you really okay?

554
00:52:19,037 --> 00:52:21,337
No, not the slightest trace.

555
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:25,538
But please don't tell Watson of this.
-Watson?  Who's that?

556
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:32,739
Well, I mean, Mr. Parker, Peinter.
-Parker?  Peinter?  Watson?

557
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:35,940
What is it, then?
-OK, Watson.

558
00:52:36,341 --> 00:52:38,341
He's a colleague of Sherlock Holmes.

559
00:52:38,642 --> 00:52:40,342
Sherlock Holmes?

560
00:52:40,543 --> 00:52:43,043
Watson had to promise Holmes not
to let me out of his sight.

561
00:52:43,044 --> 00:52:46,244
If he saw this, he'd be very upset.

562
00:52:48,045 --> 00:52:51,045
Come.  The fish is done.
-Yes, just a minute.

563
00:52:52,346 --> 00:52:55,346
A man who stands in
front of the telescope,

564
00:52:55,947 --> 00:52:58,047
spurns a good fish.

565
00:52:58,648 --> 00:53:02,948
Deserves , whether it's
summer or winter, 25...

566
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:09,749
Well, are you coming?
-There...there's somebody on the moor.

567
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:12,550
There's somebody on the moor?
-Yeah.

568
00:53:14,851 --> 00:53:17,351
Yes, got him.  What's
he doing there?

569
00:53:18,552 --> 00:53:22,352
He blowing away smoke.
-He probably has a reason.

570
00:53:23,253 --> 00:53:25,253
To not reveal his hideout.

571
00:53:26,554 --> 00:53:29,354
Now he's gone again.
-Can you show me on

572
00:53:29,355 --> 00:53:32,055
this map where he was
when he disappeared?

573
00:53:32,355 --> 00:53:36,455
A general's staff map?  -Yes, we
are to some extent in a war.

574
00:53:36,856 --> 00:53:39,356
Yes, yes, a war with ghosts.

575
00:53:40,157 --> 00:53:42,557
So, here.  There it is.

576
00:53:46,758 --> 00:53:53,158
The circle seems to
be slowly closing.

577
00:53:56,459 --> 00:53:59,859
It isn't without danger to cross
the moor at night.

578
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:04,460
However, this one path
is completely safe.

579
00:54:05,121 --> 00:54:06,461
Am I bothering the gentlemen?

580
00:54:06,862 --> 00:54:08,362
No, absolutely not.

581
00:54:08,863 --> 00:54:12,263
Mr. Stapleton is only showing Lord Henry
the property that belongs to the castle.

582
00:54:12,364 --> 00:54:17,364
Just don't let his poker face fool you.
Mr. Stapleton is a dangerous game rat.

583
00:54:17,965 --> 00:54:19,965
Goodnight, gentlemen.
-Goodnight.

584
00:54:23,066 --> 00:54:25,200
Why the secretiveness
with Miss Beryl?

585
00:54:25,201 --> 00:54:28,601
It's not necessary for her to find
out about our nightly excursions.

586
00:54:28,902 --> 00:54:32,002
It could worry her.
-Above all, it would worry us.

587
00:54:32,203 --> 00:54:35,703
Are you still of the mind that Miss
Beryl is not quite trustworthy?

588
00:54:36,604 --> 00:54:38,504
In brief, yes.

589
00:54:40,005 --> 00:54:41,505
And you, Doctor?

590
00:54:42,206 --> 00:54:45,666
Do you know who sent me the warning
letters in London?  -Yes.

591
00:54:46,267 --> 00:54:48,267
Miss Beryl.
-How do you know that?

592
00:54:48,968 --> 00:54:52,768
It's my duty to know a lot
and speak of it very little.

593
00:54:53,069 --> 00:54:55,069
Warning letters?

594
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:03,570
"If you value your life..."  It's cut
out of newspapers.  -Yes.

595
00:55:05,271 --> 00:55:07,471
A dangerous woman.

596
00:55:08,072 --> 00:55:09,572
Why?

597
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:12,073
I have learned something from
you, Mr. Waston.

598
00:55:12,674 --> 00:55:15,474
Know a lot and speak little.
-What do you know?

599
00:55:15,875 --> 00:55:21,175
Nothing specific.  But Miss Beryl belongs
professionally to that sort of woman who

600
00:55:21,176 --> 00:55:23,976
entices men to make
senseless purchases.

601
00:55:24,077 --> 00:55:29,577
How do you mean?
-Well, she was a mannequin.

602
00:55:30,579 --> 00:55:34,479
Off and on.  A model.

603
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:37,080
I am aware of that.
What of it?

604
00:55:37,481 --> 00:55:40,881
But please, I certainly didn't want to
besmirch this very honourable profession.

605
00:55:41,382 --> 00:55:45,582
And I would request that you do not.
-Gentlemen, let the models go up and down.

606
00:55:45,783 --> 00:55:47,983
We have more important
things to discuss.

607
00:55:48,184 --> 00:55:52,384
So, this was the spot where we saw the
man disappear into the caves.

608
00:55:52,485 --> 00:55:54,885
As I said, the path there is totally
safe, but for the return trip

609
00:55:54,886 --> 00:55:57,686
one will have to descend.
I will look after that.

610
00:55:58,587 --> 00:56:04,187
Now, this way across the moor, if one knows
it, is passable.  He could flee this way.

611
00:56:05,388 --> 00:56:10,888
A very perilous route, but I know every
step.  Ah, I caught a longhorn moth there.

612
00:56:10,889 --> 00:56:12,989
A wonderful exemplar.

613
00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:16,540
I must show it to you sometime.
-If it's not dangerous I'll go with you.

614
00:56:16,541 --> 00:56:18,541
That's out of the question.
You're staying with me.

615
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:20,942
I am at least somewhat
responsible for you.

616
00:56:21,043 --> 00:56:23,380
Where are you going?  -With the men.
They're going out onto the moor.

617
00:56:23,581 --> 00:56:26,481
No, you're staying here!  -No, they
can't go there alone.  Leave me!

618
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:28,182
Let happen what will happen!

619
00:56:28,182 --> 00:56:33,982
There will be a disaster and we
are at fault.  There will be a disaster!

620
00:56:55,683 --> 00:56:58,183
You must leave the castle
right away!  I wish you would.

621
00:56:58,384 --> 00:57:01,584
No, I won't let you talk me into
anything.  I won't be forced.

622
00:57:02,285 --> 00:57:04,985
I will only go when I know I
have nothing more to lose.

623
00:57:05,286 --> 00:57:09,786
I knew you loved him, but do you
realize it could cost you your life?

624
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:29,987
Wait a second.  There's something
flickering in the castle.

625
00:57:31,888 --> 00:57:34,688
That's Barrymore.
-Light in the fog?

626
00:57:50,989 --> 00:57:55,089
Night after night of this howling
sent her uncle to his death.

627
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:14,190
What are you doing here, Barrymore?

628
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:17,191
I made my security check
of the house.

629
00:58:17,392 --> 00:58:20,892
Don't lie!  You made light signals.
What did they mean?

630
00:58:21,393 --> 00:58:23,193
Nothing.  You are mistaken.

631
00:58:23,194 --> 00:58:27,794
Talk!  What kind of witchcraft is going
on?  To whom did you signal?

632
00:58:28,495 --> 00:58:30,695
That's my business and not
yours, Miss Vandeleure.

633
00:58:31,096 --> 00:58:33,996
Then I'll tell Lord Henry what's
happening behind his back.

634
00:58:34,497 --> 00:58:35,897
And he'll chase you off.

635
00:58:37,998 --> 00:58:40,498
This is the end, Eliza.

636
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:45,399
We can pack our things.
-No, it's my fault!  Mine alone!

637
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:51,345
I asked him for so long, and refused him
my love, until he did me the favour.

638
00:58:51,946 --> 00:58:55,946
Barrymore, whom did you signal?
-Go out onto the moor.

639
00:58:56,447 --> 00:58:57,847
Who is out there?

640
00:58:57,948 --> 00:59:03,648
A poor person.  He's followed by
everyone.  He's from Princetown Prison.

641
00:59:04,949 --> 00:59:06,949
He has been hiding
out there for days.

642
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:09,350
What are you doing
abetting a convict?

643
00:59:09,551 --> 00:59:12,251
He is...
-He is my brother.

644
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:21,652
And why did you give him light signals?
-To warn him.  The men went onto the moor.

645
00:59:21,753 --> 00:59:24,953
Who's on the moor?
-Lord Henry and Mr. Parker.

646
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,254
The caves must be very near here.

647
00:59:35,755 --> 00:59:37,755
Oh?  Well, take a look at the map.

648
00:59:39,156 --> 00:59:41,656
Lord Charles, a light!
Come, come!

649
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:56,257
Hands up!

650
00:59:56,258 --> 00:59:58,058
What are you doing there?

651
01:00:08,359 --> 01:00:10,059
Light.

652
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:12,560
I'll go down.

653
01:00:37,561 --> 01:00:39,061
Today's Times.

654
01:00:39,562 --> 01:00:41,562
The inhabitant is very modern.

655
01:01:00,563 --> 01:01:02,163
Hands up!

656
01:01:02,564 --> 01:01:05,064
Hands up, I said.
-I have them up.

657
01:01:05,565 --> 01:01:08,265
What do you want, Watson?
-That's Holmes!

658
01:01:10,466 --> 01:01:12,666
Of course.  It's me.

659
01:01:13,167 --> 01:01:18,167
Lord Henry, I presume.  In London you
were reluctant to come to me.

660
01:01:18,268 --> 01:01:20,868
And now you even sneak
into my digs at night.

661
01:01:20,969 --> 01:01:22,769
This is your place?
-Yes.

662
01:01:23,470 --> 01:01:25,070
Totally modern.

663
01:01:25,371 --> 01:01:29,771
Running water.  -That's astounding!
Your boots were damned dirty.

664
01:01:30,372 --> 01:01:31,872
Thank you.

665
01:01:32,373 --> 01:01:34,073
What are you doing
here, anyway?

666
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:38,774
In case there's a criminal in the
Baskerville case, there's no better hideout

667
01:01:38,775 --> 01:01:40,475
for him than these caves.

668
01:01:40,476 --> 01:01:42,276
Why didn't you contact us?

669
01:01:42,377 --> 01:01:47,630
Because I only found out this evening that
the man on the moor is an escaped prisoner.

670
01:01:47,891 --> 01:01:50,431
An escaped prisoner?  But
how do you know that?

671
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,732
I found his hideout.

672
01:01:53,433 --> 01:01:59,733
And I searched his clothes.  Prisoner
#113, Princetown Prison.

673
01:02:00,434 --> 01:02:04,234
Last night he got new clothing
from someone in the castle,

674
01:02:04,835 --> 01:02:07,900
with whom he communicated
with light signals.

675
01:02:08,401 --> 01:02:11,201
Barrymore?
-An escaped convict?

676
01:02:11,702 --> 01:02:13,402
And you're not going after him?

677
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:15,903
First he has to help me solve
the Baskerville case.

678
01:02:17,304 --> 01:02:21,704
And I think, gentlemen...
I think...

679
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:54,105
Hello!  Mr. Watson, over here!  -What,
Stapleton?  -He went down over here.

680
01:02:54,206 --> 01:02:55,806
Who?
-Lord Henry.

681
01:02:55,807 --> 01:02:58,207
Henry?
-I warned him so sternly.

682
01:02:59,408 --> 01:03:03,208
How did this happen?
-A dog chased him.  A huge dog.

683
01:03:03,409 --> 01:03:07,009
Lord Henry ran out of fear, and
didn't watch where he was going.

684
01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:09,110
That's where he fell.

685
01:03:11,311 --> 01:03:13,511
That's not Lord Henry.

686
01:03:14,612 --> 01:03:16,212
It's the convict.

687
01:03:16,413 --> 01:03:19,313
A convict?
-Poor devil.

688
01:03:21,814 --> 01:03:23,814
Are you sure you're
not mistaken?

689
01:03:24,515 --> 01:03:27,515
It was really a dog
that chased him?

690
01:03:28,916 --> 01:03:33,516
It's possible that I'm mistaken.

691
01:03:35,417 --> 01:03:39,617
An ink stain?  -This my jacket!  The
one I gave to Barrymore.

692
01:03:40,418 --> 01:03:43,018
Mr. Holmes, do you have an
explanation for that?

693
01:03:43,419 --> 01:03:47,219
Can you see to it, Lord Henry, that the
poor man gets a decent burial?

694
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:50,120
What happened to him
was meant for you.

695
01:04:04,521 --> 01:04:06,721
I thank you for your
sympathy, Milord.

696
01:04:09,322 --> 01:04:11,822
When will this criminal
finally be caught?

697
01:04:15,723 --> 01:04:20,623
Is it clear to you, Lord Henry, that it is
too dangerous for you to leave the house?

698
01:04:21,024 --> 01:04:26,024
What do you mean?  -The poor devil in there
died because he was wearing your clothes.

699
01:04:27,725 --> 01:04:32,825
A shoe of yours was stolen in London.
-Two, in fact.  A new one, which was

700
01:04:32,826 --> 01:04:37,626
returned, and later a used one.
-What's the reason behind all that?

701
01:04:40,627 --> 01:04:45,227
Because the dog could only find
a scent on the used shoe.

702
01:04:45,428 --> 01:04:48,928
Who could be interested in
siccing the beast on me?

703
01:04:49,029 --> 01:04:54,229
The next of kin.  Who would inherit Lord
Charles's estate if you were gone?

704
01:04:54,530 --> 01:04:56,530
The Vandeleures.

705
01:04:57,731 --> 01:05:01,831
Beryl.
-In case there's no male Vandeleure.

706
01:05:02,332 --> 01:05:04,432
I don't know of one.

707
01:05:12,233 --> 01:05:15,333
Who is that in the picture?
-Lord Baskerville.

708
01:05:23,134 --> 01:05:27,234
He's actually only missing a butterfly
net.  He looks like...  -Shhhh

709
01:05:29,035 --> 01:05:33,535
Lord Henry.  -Do you really think Beryl
is suspicious?  -Yes, I believe that.

710
01:05:34,036 --> 01:05:35,736
Where is the lady?
-She's sleeping.

711
01:05:36,037 --> 01:05:37,637
Then we'll wake her.

712
01:05:38,138 --> 01:05:41,138
Where's Miss Vandeleure's room?
-Follow me.

713
01:05:51,539 --> 01:05:53,939
But Holmes, in the middle of the night.

714
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:58,040
This looks like an interrogation.
-It will be an interrogation.

715
01:06:31,941 --> 01:06:35,141
When did you last see Miss Beryl?
-Before midnight.

716
01:06:35,242 --> 01:06:37,642
And where?
-Upstairs in the bay window room.

717
01:06:37,744 --> 01:06:40,444
Why did she go up there?
-She surprised me.

718
01:06:40,645 --> 01:06:45,745
Doing what?  -I was...I was
giving light signals again.

719
01:06:45,946 --> 01:06:48,546
What did Miss Beryl think about that?
She was very angry.

720
01:06:48,747 --> 01:06:50,947
But we told her the truth right away.

721
01:06:51,148 --> 01:06:55,448
Miss Vandeleure said that she didn't
think we had any intent to harm the lord.

722
01:06:56,449 --> 01:06:59,549
But she ran away, and later
I saw her leaving the house.

723
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:02,150
And where did she go?
-I don't know.

724
01:07:02,851 --> 01:07:06,651
Maybe out onto the moor.
-Hello!  What's this?

725
01:07:08,852 --> 01:07:13,452
But Mr. Holmes.  What will Miss Beryl say?
-Who cares what Miss Beryl says?

726
01:07:14,053 --> 01:07:16,753
Lord Charles died on the 18th, right?
-Yes.

727
01:07:17,054 --> 01:07:19,554
At what time?
-11 p.m.

728
01:07:20,855 --> 01:07:23,455
With whom did he talk on the
telephone at 10 minutes before 11?

729
01:07:24,156 --> 01:07:25,956
I don't know.
-Think about it!

730
01:07:26,157 --> 01:07:32,757
What do you say, Watson?  At 10:50, he was
so agitated that he insults the postal clerk.

731
01:07:32,758 --> 01:07:35,658
Because of this grievance?  There's
nothing suspicious about this.

732
01:07:35,959 --> 01:07:38,359
I gave it to Miss Beryl myself
to take care of these things.

733
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:43,360
This complaint, Lord Henry, will break
the neck of Lord Baskerville's murderer.

734
01:07:44,461 --> 01:07:46,561
You come, too.  We'll
need the whole team.

735
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:56,662
And I?  -Hold down the fort with Beryl's
help.  You two stay here.

736
01:07:56,663 --> 01:07:59,663
-Why?  -Because she'll bring us into
peril.  Think about them!

737
01:08:00,064 --> 01:08:02,834
But Holmes, you expect me to
stay here passively?

738
01:08:02,835 --> 01:08:05,935
If you promise not to leave the house, I
give you my word that you will know all

739
01:08:05,936 --> 01:08:07,936
the secrets in a few hours.

740
01:08:10,737 --> 01:08:13,137
How far is it to the post office?
-20 minutes on the country road.

741
01:08:13,138 --> 01:08:14,638
Please take the shortest route.

742
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:37,639
To call in the middle of the night!
Such lack of consideration!

743
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:45,340
Yes, yes!  I'm coming.

744
01:08:50,741 --> 01:08:53,441
Of course, it Baskerville
Castle again.

745
01:08:56,242 --> 01:09:00,642
Hello?  Yes?  Yes, Grimpen Post Office.

746
01:09:01,643 --> 01:09:04,943
Night calls cost double taxes.
You know that, right?

747
01:09:05,344 --> 01:09:08,244
Yes, yes, I know!  Please
give me Mr. Stapleton.

748
01:09:08,845 --> 01:09:12,945
No, I don't know the number.  Please
look it up.  -Number 17.  I'll connect.

749
01:09:13,446 --> 01:09:17,646
Such shenanigans, these night calls!
I'm sure I won't be able to sleep again.

750
01:09:18,847 --> 01:09:22,247
Hello, Mr. Stapleton.  Miss Beryl
left in the middle of the night!

751
01:09:22,248 --> 01:09:25,348
Where did she go?
-I don't know.  Maybe on the moor.

752
01:09:25,649 --> 01:09:28,749
Holmes and Watson are looking for her.  You
know all the paths.  Don't you want to help?

753
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:30,050
But of course.

754
01:09:30,951 --> 01:09:33,751
Naturally.
-Help!

755
01:09:35,152 --> 01:09:37,052
Hello?  Hello!

756
01:09:44,553 --> 01:09:47,253
Are you still speaking?
Are you still speaking?

757
01:09:51,754 --> 01:09:53,754
What's wrong now?

758
01:09:56,755 --> 01:10:00,355
Who's there at this time of night?
-It's me, Barrymore.

759
01:10:00,556 --> 01:10:02,556
Two gentlemen would like
to talk to you.

760
01:10:06,457 --> 01:10:11,657
Eight hours, between nine and five.  Not
at midnight.  I'm not available now.

761
01:10:11,858 --> 01:10:13,858
Especially not concerning
Baskerville Castle.

762
01:10:14,059 --> 01:10:17,059
I beg of you...
-It doesn't even concern Baskerville Castle.

763
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:20,260
Well, what then?
-It concerns you, my good lady.

764
01:10:20,261 --> 01:10:23,661
You were offended on the 18th,
at ten minutes to 11.

765
01:10:23,762 --> 01:10:26,862
We came on behalf of Lord Baskerville
to ask for your forgiveness.

766
01:10:27,063 --> 01:10:30,063
Where are the flowers, Holmes?
-Why, I gave them to you.

767
01:10:30,164 --> 01:10:33,164
Darn, I left them behind.  We'll
have them delivered tomorrow.

768
01:10:33,265 --> 01:10:37,265
It's actually unfathomable to offend
such a charming young lady.

769
01:10:37,366 --> 01:10:40,766
"Dumb person" is what he called me.
-"Dumb person".  That too!

770
01:10:40,867 --> 01:10:44,067
I can't be expected to accept that.
-No way.  Forget about accepting it.

771
01:10:44,168 --> 01:10:45,968
Uh, with whom did he telephone?

772
01:10:45,969 --> 01:10:50,769
With a nervous, unfriendly subscriber.
Number 17.  Mr. Stapleton.

773
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:55,370
Was it a common occurrence that the castle
asked to be connected to #17 at night?

774
01:10:55,771 --> 01:10:58,771
I can't remember.  Only on the
18th and today.

775
01:10:58,972 --> 01:11:04,272
Today?  -Five minutes ago I was awoken.
The castle demanded number 17.

776
01:11:04,373 --> 01:11:06,373
Maybe Miss Beryl has been found.

777
01:11:06,674 --> 01:11:08,474
Connect me with the castle.

778
01:11:16,475 --> 01:11:19,375
It'll cost you night taxes.
-Yes, yes, yes.

779
01:11:20,676 --> 01:11:24,176
Do you think Lord Henry is very attached
to Miss Beryl?  -I think so, yes.

780
01:11:24,477 --> 01:11:26,577
Why do you ask?

781
01:11:27,378 --> 01:11:30,078
But that's Stapleton arm-in-arm
with Miss Beryl.

782
01:11:30,279 --> 01:11:32,779
Even though they behaved as if
they didn't know each other.

783
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:36,480
A pair of crooks?
-What's taking so long with the phone?

784
01:11:44,381 --> 01:11:46,781
Baskerville Castle is not answering.

785
01:11:47,982 --> 01:11:51,582
No one is answering?  Then
Lord Henry isn't in the castle.

786
01:11:51,683 --> 01:11:53,683
If he went to Stapleton's, he's gone.

787
01:11:55,984 --> 01:11:57,484
Come!

788
01:11:59,085 --> 01:12:01,085
Wait!  Wait!

789
01:12:01,186 --> 01:12:05,486
Who's paying the phone charge?
Who's paying the night taxes?

790
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:45,587
Stapleton!

791
01:12:59,588 --> 01:13:01,588
A dog!

792
01:13:09,089 --> 01:13:10,589
Stapleton!

793
01:13:12,190 --> 01:13:14,290
Beryl is in the house!

794
01:13:39,991 --> 01:13:43,291
Help!  Help!

795
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,992
Henry.
-Beryl.

796
01:13:57,993 --> 01:14:01,593
Save yourself.  My brother will sic the dog
on you.  He'll kill you like he killed

797
01:14:01,594 --> 01:14:03,594
Lord Charles; to inherit everything.

798
01:14:03,694 --> 01:14:05,094
Your brother?

799
01:14:05,095 --> 01:14:09,995
Stapleton is your brother?  -Yes, he only
calls himself Stapleton.  He's a Vandeleure.

800
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:14,296
Why did you come here?  -I was scared
that something awful would happen.

801
01:14:14,797 --> 01:14:18,097
You scoundrel!  You sicced the
dog on him.

802
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:50,798
Help!

803
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,799
So, what do we learn from the
Baskerville case?

804
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:46,400
That all assumptions can be proven false
whenever a pretty woman is in play.

805
01:15:46,901 --> 01:15:48,401
True.

806
01:15:52,802 --> 01:15:54,702
A letter for Mr. Holmes.

807
01:16:06,403 --> 01:16:10,203
A letter from Baskerville Castle?
Aren't you curious what's in it?

808
01:16:10,404 --> 01:16:13,204
I know the latest news
from there.

809
01:16:13,705 --> 01:16:17,145
A letter from Lord Baskerville with
Miss Vandeleure's perfume.

810
01:16:17,746 --> 01:16:21,046
Oh, you mean...
-The same old song.

811
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:23,747
As an engaged couple,
we'll miss you.

812
01:16:24,548 --> 01:16:27,848
Only one truth has existed
since the beginning of time.

813
01:16:28,649 --> 01:16:31,649
One cannot understand women.

814
01:16:58,650 --> 01:17:02,700
The first showing of "The Hound of
Baskerville" occurred on January 27, 1937,

815
01:17:02,701 --> 01:17:06,201
in a double premiere in Berlin's Ufa
Theatre on Kurfuerstendamm and in

816
01:17:06,202 --> 01:17:10,202
Primus Palace.  Following two silent-film
adaptations from the years 1914 (direction:

817
01:17:10,203 --> 01:17:14,203
Rudolf Meinert) and 1929 (direction:
Richard Oswald), this is the third film

818
01:17:14,204 --> 01:17:18,204
version of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's "The
Hound of the Baskervilles" to have been

819
01:17:18,205 --> 01:17:20,205
filmed in a German studio.
