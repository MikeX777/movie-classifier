1
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:07,966
<i>Some people say that ghosts do exist.</i>

2
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:11,970
<i>Some people say
that ghosts do not exist.</i>

3
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:16,975
<i>But I say... Hui Buh is a ghost.</i>

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,437
<i>And what a ghost I am.</i>

5
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:24,024
<i>There is nothing more terrifying.</i>

6
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,693
<i>Well, except maybe...</i>

7
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,530
<i>I do have a problem with witches.</i>

8
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,323
<i>You might even say</i>

9
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,492
<i>I have an intolerance
towards them.</i>

10
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:35,827
<i>And witches are at their worst</i>

11
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,038
<i>when you have them
in the family.</i>

12
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:55,055
- Stop! Don't move.
- This way.

13
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,902
Darn! Every time.

14
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,573
Get inside.

15
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,576
Keep going.

16
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:18,579
Left.

17
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,835
We're trapped!

18
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:36,096
You'll have to look after it now.
You'll be fine.

19
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:37,931
I...

20
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,894
Go on, hide!

21
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,023
Under the bed.

22
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,950
Go to Hui Buh, in Burgeck Castle.

23
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,912
What about you'? We were taking it
to Diandra in the Witches' Woods.

24
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,373
Too dangerous. You can't go alone.

25
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:08,295
I'll lead them the wrong way.
Promise me, you'll go to Hui Buh.

26
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,399
Erla, nice to see you.

27
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,527
I guessed it was you
by the gentle knocking.

28
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,702
- Give it to me.
- I don't have it.

29
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:52,839
Where is that girl of yours?

30
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:57,260
She'll be with Diandra by now.
Don't waste your time here.

31
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:03,517
We both know your time is running out.
Whatever spin you put on it.

32
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:11,858
Take her away!

33
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,195
Thank you.

34
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:50,540
<i>25km to Burgeck Castle,
the haunt of the spookiest spook.</i>

35
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,376
<i>Haunted dinner premiere tonight!</i>

36
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:06,932
HUI BUH AND THE WITCH'S CASTLE

37
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:16,900
BURGECK CASTLE
THE HAUNT OF THE SPOOKIEST SPOOK

38
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:27,244
THE ONLY OFFICIALLY APPROVED GHOST
IN BURGECK CASTLE

39
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:01,069
- My bad.
- Stop! Stop! ArrÃ©te!

40
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:05,991
I told you to take your 'ead off

41
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,702
before the 'orrible ghostly 'owling.

42
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:12,747
Oh, yes. Of course.
First my head, then the howling.

43
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:16,084
<i>- Oui!</i>
- I'm a bit nervous about the premiere.

44
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:22,340
- Yeah, let's say it's nerves.
- Right. Be honest, Charles. How was I?

45
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:26,094
It was a Titanic performance.
A disaster, of course.

46
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,387
Oh, thanks!

47
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,932
<i>Qu'est-ce que (fest?</i>

48
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:37,439
<i>Merde!</i> The first guests.
Where is 'is Majesty?

49
00:06:56,917 --> 00:07:01,171
- Hey, it's starting, Julius! Oh, dear.
- The first guests are here.

50
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:05,634
- Jule! Merde! Qu'est-ce que tu <i>fais?</i>
- It's our grand premiere!

51
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:08,887
Are you ready
to put in a royal appearance?

52
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,765
No, but I won't get any readier.

53
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,558
- Poppycock.
- Come on.

54
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:17,395
It'll be a sensation.
The spookiest dinner ever!

55
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,274
I will let you have one attempt.

56
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,070
If this goes wrong,
there will be no more.

57
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,448
Don't worry.
The premiere will go down a storm.

58
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,408
I can see the headlines.

59
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:34,412
"Spooky Hui Buh
sets the haunting bar sky-high."

60
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,248
If you say so.
How did your rehearsal go?

61
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,085
So well.

62
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,841
Why did I let myself in for this?

63
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:50,887
Maybe so we don't 'ave to use
the furniture for 'eating.

64
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,100
Of course you're right, Charles.

65
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:59,479
What have I got to lose?
My marriage is over, my fortune is gone.

66
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,357
You still have me.

67
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:05,318
- And I still have you.
- Yes.

68
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:10,407
Okay, let's get it over with
before I change my mind.

69
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:13,868
You'll thank me later.
Remember what I said.

70
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,497
Sorry! My bad!

71
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:27,716
If only I hadn't lived so healthily
in my youth, I might hope to die early.

72
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,677
- Come on, Charles.
- Mon <i>Dieu!</i>

73
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,805
I'm fine.

74
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,976
I have to be.

75
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:48,903
Honored...

76
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,532
Excuse me. Honored guests.

77
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,743
This event is not for the faint-hearted.

78
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,870
In just a few minutes...

79
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,372
<i>Pardon.</i>

80
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:04,335
In just a few minutes,
haunting hour begins.

81
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,130
It's seven minutes past five.

82
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,677
- Oh, really?
- Young man...

83
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:16,598
This is part of a grand show,
a dramatic element.

84
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:20,477
- It's light outside.
- And that fish isn't fresh.

85
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,396
Even if the menu says so.
That's reality.

86
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:24,939
Get used to it.

87
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,820
Great. I've lost my thread.

88
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,367
Uh... Where was I?

89
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:41,039
- Sir Balduin the knight.
- Ah, yes. That's right.

90
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,750
More than 500 years ago,

91
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:48,463
proud Sir Balduin was brutally murdered
here at Burgeck Castle.

92
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:52,092
Since that day,
he has haunted these walls

93
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,386
in the form of a spirit
known as Hui Buh.

94
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:59,182
He appears every night
at... haunting hour.

95
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,661
HALBARD <i>ll</i> CHANDELIER

96
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,669
DOOR

97
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,194
That's supposed to be scary?

98
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,196
How about some soup?

99
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:02,787
- Give me that pumpkin.
- My head!

100
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,914
Give it back, you villain!

101
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:08,835
- The joke's over. Give it back.
- Sure. Here you are.

102
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:15,300
Spooking hell!
Julius, should I start over?

103
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,844
All right. I'll get it for you.

104
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,346
Julius? Is that you?

105
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,976
At least it can't get any worse...

106
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,729
Where am I?

107
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,452
Jules!

108
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,331
I'm stuck...

109
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,541
Someone? Help me out?

110
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,212
Look. This place isn't haunted.

111
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:53,630
It's a con.

112
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,009
- We came all that way for this?
- Quite outrageous.

113
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,971
We won't put up with this.
Come on, son. We're leaving.

114
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,891
One moment! I'm nearly there now.

115
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:08,728
- The show will be worth the wait.
- My God!

116
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:12,106
I've rarely witnessed
anything so pathetic.

117
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,151
You're a king, for pity's sake!

118
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:19,822
Yeah, I... I'm recently separated.
I've let myself go.

119
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,368
Put it this way: I need the money.

120
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,621
- Separated?
- Mm.

121
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:32,335
Keep your chin up. You'll be all right.

122
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,381
Things'll turn out.

123
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,093
Where am I? Julius?

124
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:46,766
There. I told you so.
I've frightened them all away.

125
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,435
Though next time you should mention

126
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,146
that I'm the only approved ghost here.

127
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,482
Next... Next time?

128
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:55,733
Yes.

129
00:12:55,984 --> 00:13:01,322
Next time you should just kill me first.
I'm going to make ghostmeat out of you.

130
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:08,913
Yes?

131
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:13,584
- Is this the haunt of spooky Hui Buh?
- I'm sorry, my dear.

132
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:15,461
The show's over.

133
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:20,008
- Where are your parents?
- That's why I'm here. I need his help.

134
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:23,845
You need help? From Hui Buh?
Come inside...

135
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,016
- Don't let her in!
- Uh...

136
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:32,729
That's a little girl who needs our help.
What the devil's got into you?

137
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,189
Didn't you see'? Her eyes!

138
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,608
- She's a witch!
- A w...?

139
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:45,950
- Everything will be all right now.
- Let go!

140
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:50,496
Who are you? You can't break in here
and hug strange ghosts.

141
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,957
I'm just so glad I found you.

142
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,084
I'm Ophelia, your niece.

143
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,003
Uh, niece?

144
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,797
Hui Buh is your... uncle?

145
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,176
I'd say so, yes.

146
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,011
Uncle Hui.

147
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,597
I haven't heard from Maria in a century.

148
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:11,934
Okay, so that's nothing unusual.
But now you show up, alone.

149
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,313
And claim to be her daughter.
Seems fishy.

150
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,737
- That's my mother, and that's me.
- That's Maria.

151
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,281
That proves nothing.

152
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:27,867
If Maria is your mother, you must know

153
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,577
her birth date.

154
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,538
March 13th, 1373.

155
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,999
- Favorite food?
- Apple pie.

156
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,751
- Blood type?
- AB negative.

157
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:38,920
- Polka troupe?
- Trick question.

158
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:42,965
- She hates polka.
- There. Learned by rote!

159
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:47,178
- She has something to hide.
- So, your sister is a witch?

160
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:51,516
The black sheep of the family.
She cheats at cards.

161
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:56,396
- That's how she got into witch school.
- So it runs in the family. And...

162
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:01,776
- Where is your mother now?
- We had to run away. From evil Erla.

163
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:04,237
But she found us and abducted Mom.

164
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:08,950
- Maria abducted? What are you saying?
- You must help me save her.

165
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,244
Of course we will help you.

166
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:14,914
Who is this Erla,
and what does she want with your mother?

167
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:18,209
I'll show you.
If you promise to help me.

168
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,256
<i>Mon Dieu!</i>

169
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,591
What the 'eck 'appened 'ere?

170
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:28,469
And who is this young mademoiselle?

171
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,721
Charles, we have a guest.

172
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,516
Could you conjure up something to eat?

173
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:38,062
- You're probably hungry, right?
- Of course, Your Majesty.

174
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,690
<i>N 'est pas de problÃ©me. AprÃ©s vous.</i>

175
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:10,761
<i>VoilÃ !</i>

176
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:14,557
- Promise not to tell.
- Don't keep us in suspense.

177
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:17,101
King's honor.

178
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:23,357
I will be as silent as...
as this baguette.

179
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,999
Russian nesting suitcases. Not bad.

180
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:44,629
- Almost as good as my moldy trunk.
- I know it's beside the point.

181
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:48,132
- But where can I buy such a case?
- Charles!

182
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:53,721
My mother got it in Russia.
She... won it.

183
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,556
Sure. She "won" it.

184
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:05,566
- And that's what this Erla is after?
- No.

185
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:11,197
- She wants this.
- And what's in there?

186
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,784
Mom and some other witches
took it from Erla years ago.

187
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,036
- She mustn't get it back.
- That's...

188
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,372
<i>- the Necronomicon!
- Le Necronomicon?</i>

189
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:22,041
- The famous book of magic?
- May I touch?

190
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,668
Please, please, please.

191
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:26,879
- Thanks.
- Careful! It can...

192
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,423
cover the world in darkness.

193
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:32,677
- Spread horror and fear. Lovely!
- Sounds great.

194
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,012
Yes, it has its drawbacks for you.

195
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:39,225
Is this a marriage proposal
or something? I can't breathe!

196
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:46,357
Oh, I'm sorry.
May I introduce myself? Buh, Hui Buh.

197
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:47,733
Hui what?

198
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:51,320
Hui Buh.
The only officially approved ghost here.

199
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,156
I'm your biggest fan. You're a legend.

200
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,909
I hear that so much! "You're a legend.

201
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,413
You're the darkest book of magic.
I'm your biggest fan."

202
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,374
But I really am. Look!

203
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:08,129
<i>My Necronomicon fan club card,
scarf, toilet paper and sticker album.</i>

204
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:11,090
- There's a sticker album?
- Absolutely!

205
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:17,430
As my biggest fan, I'll let you in
on a secret. Take a look at page 666.

206
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,016
That'll give you the magic you need

207
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:24,770
if you're looking for a bit less "hui"
and a lot more "buh."

208
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,564
More "buh"?

209
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:30,610
More terrifying than any creature
in this world or the next.

210
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:34,780
- How does that sound to you?
- Oh, that sounds marv...

211
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,283
You must never use this book!

212
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:42,163
- It'll lead you astray, bring calamity.
- Just one tiny peek...

213
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:44,790
- Right. One peek can't hurt...
- Stop now.

214
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:48,336
The magic in that book
is very old and very evil.

215
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:51,005
Erla used it to steal life
from other witches.

216
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:54,550
And since she lost the book
she's running out of time?

217
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,177
And

218
00:18:56,927 --> 00:19:01,057
- And she's getting nervous?
- She'd do anything to get it back.

219
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:14,278
What was that?

220
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,579
It sounded like a window smashing.

221
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,374
If he weren't 'ere...

222
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:29,794
I would 'ave guessed
it was our resident ghost.

223
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:32,171
That's not funny.

224
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:35,466
- Erla and her witches.
- Maybe they followed you.

225
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:38,719
H... Hang on! Witches?
You mean, more than one?

226
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,013
- Did I mention my Wiccaphobia?
- What?

227
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:46,394
My fear of witches. Common among ghosts.
They're the only ones who can harm us.

228
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:50,648
Mom's been a witch since you were small.

229
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:54,110
Precisely.
She made my childhood pretty tough.

230
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,364
Do you get the feeling
we're being watched?

231
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,409
Behind you!

232
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,452
The witches! Run!

233
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:04,954
- Quick!
- No escape!

234
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,664
"Ophelia!
Help!

235
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,040
Hui Buh!

236
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:16,215
After them!
They're flying to the belfry.

237
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,261
Quicker, Charles!

238
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,556
Witches, witches! What shall I do?

239
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,434
Oh, of course! I'll be-witch them!

240
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:41,323
Where is my mother?

241
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:44,994
You'll never see her again.

242
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:49,582
If you don't tell me right away
where the Necronomicon is!

243
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,542
<i>Baalsuku praesido marukk!</i>

244
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:03,971
- That was fun, wasn't it'?
- That was totally spooked out!

245
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,566
- Are you crazy?
- It said, "A small defensive spell."

246
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:18,694
What do they say?
"The end justifies the beans."

247
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:23,073
The means. But otherwise
you're absolutely right, biggest fan.

248
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:24,658
Let's keep...

249
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:29,121
Didn't you listen?
You can't ever use the book!

250
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,874
- Sacre' bleu!
- The witches?

251
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,251
I frightened them away.

252
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:37,755
I'll regret asking,
but what happened to the wall?

253
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:41,342
He used the Necronomicon.
Now Erla knows we have it.

254
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:43,928
She'll reduce everything to rubble.

255
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:46,472
To rubble? My castle?

256
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:50,184
No, no, Your Majesty.
We will fight to the last man.

257
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:55,189
Good attitude, Charles. A few
hysterical witches don't bother you.

258
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,485
- Then I'll take the book...
- Easy now, spook boy!

259
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,821
How can we defeat Erla?

260
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:05,324
Does she have a weak spot?
Any powerful enemies?

261
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:07,326
Diandra.

262
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,578
- Diandra?
- Queen of the good witches.

263
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:13,833
She has a castle in the Witches' Woods.
Only she can defeat Erla.

264
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:17,503
- You have to take me to her.
- That's it! One moment...

265
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,465
Almost have it. No. No.

266
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,467
No.

267
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:31,725
- Here. From the bottom of my heart.
- An old broom?

268
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:35,437
It'll take you in a jiffy
to the Witches' Woods and... Diana.

269
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,064
- Diandra.
- Exactly.

270
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:38,899
And that's an offensive stereotype.

271
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:42,945
- We don't all ride broomsticks.
- Maybe you should try harder?

272
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:47,825
Whatever. Go on foot.
I'll take care of the Necronomicon.

273
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:49,535
Hey!

274
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,745
- I just want to...
- Hey!

275
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:54,748
- I bet on the little girl.
- So do i.

276
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:02,798
If you won't help me save my mom,
I'll go on my own.

277
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:07,219
- And I'll be taking the Necronomicon.
- Wait. Of course we'll help.

278
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,971
Ghost's honor.

279
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:11,849
- Right, Julius?
- Oh, now you have honor?

280
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,101
We can't leave the book alone.

281
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:15,978
I mean, Ophelia.

282
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,897
Ophelia and the book.

283
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,649
- And my dear sister.
- Stop it now.

284
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,611
Brooms are uncomfy.
I have a better plan.

285
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,488
So you're going to help me?

286
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:30,326
No one may abduct the sister
of my resident ghost

287
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:33,162
and threaten
to reduce my castle to rubble.

288
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:34,622
<i>Oui!</i>

289
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,682
It's just over there. In the barn.

290
00:23:56,226 --> 00:24:01,774
Your Majesty, if I may. I see that
you still miss Madame Konstanzia.

291
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,944
Nonsense.
I'm delighted to be rid of her.

292
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,696
A king needs his freedom, Charles.

293
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,658
To conduct state business, for instance.

294
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,202
And to... to...

295
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:15,371
To... Oh, you know!

296
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:20,167
- Of course, Your Majesty.
- Should I carry your case?

297
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,670
I'm sure it must be... heavy.

298
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,090
- I'm old enough to look after it myself.
- Sure.

299
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,635
- How old are you?
- I'm 99. I turn 100 in December.

300
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,804
Hmm. Well preserved.

301
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:34,223
It's very young for a witch.

302
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:39,812
- Wow!
- A biplane!

303
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:43,190
A Royal Aircraft Factory SE5.

304
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:47,695
200 horsepower, wingspan
of eight meters, eleven centimeters,

305
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:51,198
and a top speed
of 222 kilometers per hour.

306
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,787
The two of us have gone through
many adventures together.

307
00:24:56,954 --> 00:25:00,499
Unfortunately the old girl
only has two seats.

308
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,378
Mon capitaine! You can't fly without me!

309
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:09,174
- Someone has to look after the castle.
- But, mon prÃ©sident!

310
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,093
Who will look after you?

311
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,470
I'll be back before long.

312
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:17,391
What about me?
Am I coming along as hand baggage?

313
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:22,187
Well, you could call it...
the first-class compartment for ghosts.

314
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,836
THE WITCHES' WOODS

315
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:02,186
- Everything all right up there?
- Amazing views!

316
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:04,980
I didn't know the woods were so big.

317
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,275
Oh, yes.
The views in here are amazing too.

318
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:11,820
I won't give the service on this airline
a good review.

319
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:15,866
- Be so good as to remain in your seat.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

320
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:17,367
Witches below!

321
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:23,957
- This is the edge of the Witches' Woods.
- Strange.

322
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:27,836
They must hear us,
but they're not paying us any attention!

323
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:30,380
I'll stay as high as possible.

324
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,386
Somethings brewing.

325
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:40,265
We usually only gather
on special occasions.

326
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:42,267
Like Walpurgis Night.

327
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:45,395
<i>Hui Buh.</i>

328
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:49,066
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

329
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:51,485
Well, the... Oh, nothing.

330
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:56,198
<i>- Hey, biggest fan.</i>
- Yes?

331
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,242
<i>I know what you want.</i>

332
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:02,955
<i>- To be the spookiest spook.
- Oh, yes.</i> I <i>do</i> want that.

333
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:07,584
<i>- Forget about your friends.
- Forget my friends?</i>

334
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:09,378
<i>Right.
Stop W.!</i>

335
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,973
- What the...
- Uh-oh!

336
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:22,975
- Oh no.
- The tank was full!

337
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:26,520
The engine!

338
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:30,023
Ophelia, a spell!

339
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,318
<i>Movere leviosa!</i>

340
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:39,616
- Oops!
- Goggles on! Hold tight!

341
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:42,119
Emergency landing!

342
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:13,400
- That was wild!
- You can say that again.

343
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,903
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

344
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:22,034
- Next time I'll bring a neck pillow.
- Sorry, old girl. I'll fix you up again.

345
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:31,251
It's pretty spooky here.

346
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:35,464
- You might want to be invisible.
- Good idea.

347
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,049
No more magic.

348
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:42,471
We don't need a horde of peasants
chasing us with torches and pitchforks.

349
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,682
That's true.
The running is quite tiresome.

350
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:49,436
And being burned at the stake
isn't as cozy as it sounds.

351
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:55,359
Don't you think it's weird no one here
is interested in our little plane crash?

352
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:00,906
Very weird.

353
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:04,868
There's an inn back there. Let's go.

354
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,673
"The Rusty Pentagram."

355
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:20,008
Doesn't that sound inviting?

356
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:22,636
Pentagrams ward off evil.

357
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:27,224
- As do these signs.
- The people here must be superstitious.

358
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:31,603
Leave the talking to me.
I speak the language of the common man.

359
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:36,149
What are you waiting for?
There's good grub in here.

360
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:41,446
We'd better get inside then.
Before he causes trouble.

361
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:06,555
I wish you a very good evening,
my good men.

362
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,016
Charming village you have here.

363
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:21,820
Well met, my good fellow.
You must be the innkeeper.

364
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,406
Extraordinarily cozy place you keep.

365
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,791
I'm afraid to say
that we crashed our plane.

366
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:38,712
An unfortunate mishap.
And now we need a room and a meal.

367
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:42,924
So there's no misunderstanding,
I'm talking about aircraft

368
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,635
not about witchcraft.

369
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:48,972
That wouldn't fly with us.

370
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,610
Can you understand me?

371
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:06,114
My mom was abducted by witches.

372
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:09,201
- Ophelia!
- Goodness me. What did you say?

373
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:13,330
- Abducted by witches? How awful.
- Yes.

374
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,791
She's a witch too. But a good one.

375
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:20,170
We want to save her. We must go
to Diandra and ask for her help.

376
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,965
Some good witches
vanished from here too.

377
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:29,179
Strange, isn't it? Something is going on
out there in the woods.

378
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,891
That's why
we're being more careful than ever.

379
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,186
All right, then.

380
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,980
Come on in. Have a seat. Come along.

381
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:42,025
I'll bring some food.

382
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:45,904
And then you can tell me about it.
Right, my lovelies.

383
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:52,327
My name is Andrej, and I'll be
taking care of you this evening.

384
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,915
Here. For the main course,
I recommend the leg of duck.

385
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,751
It comes
in a tangy sage and lemon sauce.

386
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:02,712
But I'd like
to keep the dessert a surprise.

387
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:05,340
Well...

388
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:07,175
Perfect.

389
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:15,517
Oh, what the hey!
It's a white chocolate and mint mousse.

390
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:20,105
- I just can't keep a secret.
- Yeah, I'm the same.

391
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:23,984
Oh, and tell your ghost
he's welcome to sit with you.

392
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:28,238
Hello? What's up with you guys?

393
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,866
We live on the edge
of the Witches' Woods.

394
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:33,160
He's not our first undead guest.

395
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:40,125
How about that. It's so nice here.

396
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,428
Right, my dears.

397
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:55,932
This line of salt by the window
will keep evil forces at bay.

398
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:59,060
- Thank you.
- A bit of salt will keep witches away?

399
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:02,689
Shouldn't we at least add
a little pepper to it?

400
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:04,441
Or chili?

401
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:10,405
You're quite the firebrand.
Make sure it doesn't get broken, okay?

402
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:13,450
There's one more thing.
Our plane is outside.

403
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:17,537
We don't want the witches
to know we crash landed here.

404
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,998
I'll get a few strong boys together

405
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:22,751
and we'll roll it into the courtyard.

406
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:27,422
Hui Buh, take care of Ophelia.
And no haunting.

407
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:30,759
- Ghost's honor.
- The other way around, I think.

408
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,929
- Ophelia, take care of Hui Buh.
- Thanks, Julius.

409
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:41,811
- Into the courtyard.
- Thank you for this. It's really...

410
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:45,357
Did you hear that?

411
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,494
- Mom talked about you.
- Really?

412
00:33:57,661 --> 00:34:01,289
Yes. She said that you are
a layabout and a rascal.

413
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,961
- But you can be trusted in a pinch.
- Did she mention how spooky I am?

414
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:09,464
No. She said you're
the funniest ghost in the world.

415
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:13,969
That's...

416
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:15,554
funny.

417
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:19,307
- Did I say something wrong?
- Oh, no...

418
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,101
No, I mean...

419
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:24,396
To be honest, Maria is probably right.
I...

420
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,358
I'm a joke.

421
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:32,612
Hui Buh, I didn't mean it like that.

422
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,617
I don't care if you're spooky.
You're my absolute favorite ghost.

423
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:39,911
Thanks, but...

424
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,581
You wouldn't understand. I...

425
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:47,168
- What's that?
- Oh, I have to feed the puppies.

426
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,629
Puppies in the suitcase?

427
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:53,300
I always travel with puppies.
So I don't feel lonely.

428
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:57,220
Meet Brutus, Knirps, Ronja,
Oskar, Lotte and U...

429
00:34:57,846 --> 00:34:59,306
Uwe?

430
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,477
He always runs off.

431
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,146
Uwe!

432
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:09,190
Uwe! Where have you gone this time?

433
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,735
The funniest ghost in the world.

434
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:15,363
I could probably do
with a few puppies too.

435
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,115
<i>Hui Buh.</i>

436
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:20,619
<i>Hey, biggest fan.</i>

437
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,330
<i>No one can get in our way now.</i>

438
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,166
I can't. I promised.

439
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:30,253
<i>Just one little peek.
No one need know about it.</i>

440
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:35,800
<i>- Just</i> do <i>it.</i>
- Oh, a quick peek really can't hurt.

441
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:38,428
You have to...

442
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,267
- Here he is.
- W ho?

443
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:47,687
- Uwe!
- He ran down into the dining area.

444
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,564
What a scamp.

445
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:53,026
- Uwe is the naughtiest of all.
- Naughty Uwe.

446
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,445
I have to go to the little ghosts' room.

447
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:58,114
Okay.

448
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:00,784
That wasn't so difficult, was it?

449
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,245
- Hui Buh! Help me!
- Ophelia!

450
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,166
Help! Hui Buh!

451
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:10,794
Ophelia!

452
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:18,760
- Where's Ophelia?
- There! I can't pass through the door.

453
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:21,262
- Because of the signs.
- Help!

454
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,306
What? Oh!

455
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,559
Help!
"Ophelia!

456
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,269
'Help!
"No!

457
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:31,523
Out of my way!

458
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,317
- Erla!
- The case with the Nec...

459
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:40,240
Forget about that girl
if you want to go on living.

460
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,248
I only stepped out briefly.

461
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:50,500
You were supposed to take care of her!

462
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,752
You told her to take care of me.

463
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:55,755
Now Ophelia is gone
and Erla has the book.

464
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:59,134
Uh... Well, the book is...

465
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:01,511
The book is... Uh...

466
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:06,141
- Yes?
- not important right now.

467
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:10,729
- What matters now is Ophelia!
- How could the witches break the line?

468
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:15,108
None of that matters right now!

469
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:17,610
We have to follow them at once!

470
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,989
You're right for once.
Where might Erla take her?

471
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:26,161
No one knows where Erla can be found.
All who tried never came back.

472
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:29,289
The only one who can help us now
is Diandra.

473
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:35,003
The path behind the gates
leads into the Witches' Woods.

474
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,297
That's where Diandra's castle is.

475
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:39,382
A gorgeous location.

476
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:41,593
But beware.

477
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:46,222
Countless horrors lurk
in the Witches' Woods.

478
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:51,561
Never fear! Where I come from,
I'm considered quite a horror myself.

479
00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:00,862
You're priceless!
The little guy is unbelievable!

480
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,239
Now listen, you philistine!

481
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,825
I think it's time for us to get going.

482
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:12,540
Could you send this telegram
to Charles Balmain at Burgeck Castle?

483
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,250
- Of course.
- Thank you.

484
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,172
- Good luck, boys!
- Yeah...

485
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:21,174
Do come again.

486
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:24,844
We have
a delectable vegan brunch every Sunday!

487
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,054
Ciao!

488
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,680
- Ciao!
- Ciao!

489
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,307
- Ciao!
- Yeah, bye.

490
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:33,061
Hurry up! My time is trickling away!

491
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,240
My patience has come to an end.

492
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:50,537
- Where is the Necronomicon?
- My patience has come to an end too.

493
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:53,498
Where is my mother, you monster?

494
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:59,838
She will pay for every insolent answer

495
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,090
that you give me!

496
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:12,016
Oh, dear.

497
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:15,228
- I think we took a wrong turning.
- Great.

498
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,983
- Well, what now?
- Good question.

499
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:27,115
"Diandra's Castle"?

500
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,785
Someone's trying
to stop people finding it.

501
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,663
I think they want to stop us finding it.

502
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:37,750
Hang on!

503
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:41,421
Do you smell that?

504
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,842
A gingerbread house?

505
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:49,470
Awesome.

506
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:52,223
I thought you'd swiped some cookies.

507
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,642
Maybe we've found Erla's lair.

508
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:57,770
- Let's get closer.
- Only look at it.

509
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:01,107
- Of course.
- No biting chunks off that house.

510
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:04,110
- Is that clear?
- Not a single nibble?

511
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:15,121
Let's follow it. Before it scoots off.

512
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,834
- What the heck?
- Ow!

513
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:22,629
Darn! Ghost-proof again!

514
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:24,881
We're caught in a trap!

515
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:30,303
Ah! Set by the good, old
wicked Gingerbread Witch.

516
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:35,224
- She'll fatten us up and roast us!
- Shut it. I don't do that anymore.

517
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:39,520
The fattening up or the roasting?
I wouldn't mind the first part.

518
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:43,524
The roasting part.
That's nothing but bad karma.

519
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,985
I've been reading this book.

520
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:49,155
It says that prevented me
from making friends.

521
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:53,576
- Maybe that Smartass author was right.
- Then why the cage?

522
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:56,496
To protect myself, brainbox.

523
00:40:56,746 --> 00:41:01,376
Strange things have been happening
in the Witches' Woods recently.

524
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:04,671
It's probably that stupid cow Erla
up to no good.

525
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:06,881
That stupid cow Erla?

526
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:12,470
- Do you know where we might find her?
- What do you want with her? Spit it out!

527
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,640
Erla has abducted
my niece and my sister.

528
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:20,019
- We want to ask Diandra for help.
- Do you know the way to her castle?

529
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,438
I'll do a deal with you.

530
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,816
I'll tell you the way to Diandra

531
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:27,652
if you come in for some coffee and cake.

532
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:30,363
- I rarely get visitors.
- You have cake'?

533
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,824
Of course, you dunce! Look at my house!

534
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:36,494
- She has cake!
- If not here, where else, huh?

535
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,961
How do you like my hut's legs?

536
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:50,508
I won them off that newbie baba Yaga
in a game of witches' bingo. Here.

537
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,094
"Making Friends for Dummies"?

538
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,684
If you want to make friends,
maybe rein in the insults?

539
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:02,311
Witch Tourette's runs in my family,
pea-brain!

540
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:04,564
Oh, I see.

541
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:08,234
Why did Erla abduct
the girl and her mom?

542
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:12,530
- She wants the Necronomicon.
- Well, nibble my nuts!

543
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:16,701
- She mustn't get her hands on it.
- I fear she already has.

544
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:22,165
That's not good. That's not at all good.
That's horrifying.

545
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:25,668
That's no good at all. Not good.

546
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:27,962
Excuse me, what are you doing?

547
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:32,425
What does it look like?
I'm packing the house ready to go.

548
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:36,012
- Things'll fly when it starts running.
- Packing?

549
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:38,431
- Running?
- You couple of duds!

550
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:41,350
You don't understand what's at stake!

551
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:45,813
If Erla has the Necronomicon,
life will get very uncomfortable.

552
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:48,357
She'll open the door to the Underworld

553
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:51,986
and steal the life energy
from everyone here.

554
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:55,782
So I'm leaving the Witches' Woods,
and you should do the same.

555
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:58,284
Open the gate to the Underworld?

556
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,412
The more I hear, the less I like it.

557
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,956
Tell your niece and sister that too.

558
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:07,251
They'll be the first.
Oh, I need some sugar.

559
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,379
Well...

560
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,924
Are you warm too, or is it just me?

561
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,676
I need some fresh air.

562
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:21,099
Hey, biggest fan.

563
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:24,852
You have to help me.
Erla has abducted Maria and Ophelia.

564
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:29,857
- She wants to steal their life energy!
- So? What's the problem?

565
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:32,819
Can't you just magic them here?

566
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:36,364
We have to work on your attitude, pal.

567
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:39,575
Do you want
to be the spookiest spook or not?

568
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:42,161
- Super-naturally.
- Then listen.

569
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:46,374
The others stand in your way.
They want to keep you down.

570
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:49,418
But you've
already realized that yourself.

571
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:51,546
But Julius is my friend.

572
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:55,341
Oh, yes? Would a friend
make you fly as hold baggage?

573
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:58,719
Oh, that's just
a bit of fun between buddies.

574
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,805
- I don't mind that.
- Ah.

575
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:03,307
So it was just a bit of fun
at the dinner

576
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:07,145
when he gave you no credit
as Burgeck's spookiest spook?

577
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:09,397
You're right. That was mean.

578
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:12,066
Hang on. How do you know about that?

579
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:16,696
I'm the most magical book in the world.
But what are you?

580
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:21,200
It's about time people started
treating you with respect.

581
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:24,871
You're right. I will get myself
some spooking respect!

582
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:27,498
- Hui Buh?
- Julius!

583
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:29,876
Were you talking to someone?

584
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:31,711
Talking? Me?

585
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:35,131
Why are you always so mistrustful?

586
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:38,968
Because everything you do
ends up in a big old mess.

587
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:42,972
- For everyone around you.
- You just want to keep me down!

588
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:47,810
- Call yourself my friend?
- Fart-faces, going to Diandra's castle?

589
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:51,564
- I don't have all night.
- "Fart-faces" is my cue!

590
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:03,951
- So, there it is. Get lost now.
- Gladly.

591
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:07,538
- We're very grate...
- Shut your silly mouth.

592
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:10,374
Good luck.

593
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:14,086
Do you think they'll let us in?

594
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:20,885
- I'll unleash some royal charm.
- And I'll make myself invisible.

595
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,971
It's better than peeing in my pants.

596
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:28,517
I don't have a change of clothes.
Why not, I wonder?

597
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:31,395
Oh, let's turn back and pack our cases.

598
00:45:32,188 --> 00:45:34,023
No?

599
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,030
That's pretty creepy!

600
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,866
They clearly keep
a tight lid on security.

601
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:47,536
Hello... everyone.

602
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:50,581
We... i would like to see Diandra.

603
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,778
Witches. Witches everywhere.

604
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:25,950
Hello there.

605
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:29,036
Glad to meet you.

606
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:32,748
- Hui Buh. I need you here.
- I can't do it, Julius.

607
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:35,876
- Right now.
- Oh, I'm going to regret this.

608
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:38,129
Which one is Diandra?

609
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:43,634
I expect she's old, wrinkled,
covered in warts.

610
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,470
With breath that makes your eyes sting.

611
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:49,473
Then I hope you're not too disappointed.

612
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,058
Wow.

613
00:46:52,852 --> 00:46:54,979
Not at all, Your Majesty.

614
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:58,357
- I am...
- King Julius the 111th.

615
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:01,527
- And Hui Buh, ghost of Burgeck.
- She knows me.

616
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:03,571
- Fancy that.
- Welcome.

617
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:06,240
We rarely have royal visitors.

618
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:08,451
Let us toast the occasion.

619
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:10,119
A welcome cocktail?

620
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:12,246
Certainly. Thank you.

621
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:15,416
Well, this is a surprise.

622
00:47:19,462 --> 00:47:20,796
Yummy.

623
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:24,133
I must say, you are very well informed.

624
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,260
As a queen, I have to be.

625
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,013
I must tell you, my dear Julius,

626
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:31,974
I've heard so much about you.

627
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:37,063
- But the stories don't do you justice.
- Oh, you flatter me, my dear.

628
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:39,398
- Are you single?
- Yes.

629
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:43,944
No. Although...
Yes, I am. As of recently.

630
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:48,366
Keep your brain on track, buddy.
There are more important matters.

631
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:50,951
Yes, you're right, of course.

632
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:56,665
- We're here because Erla...
- abducted little Ophelia.

633
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:59,168
The news has spread like wildfire.

634
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:02,671
And she has Ophelia's mother.
Your sister.

635
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:05,341
She's got all the facts, huh?

636
00:48:06,342 --> 00:48:10,471
Could you tell us where Erla took them?
Unfortunately not.

637
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:15,017
The most urgent question is:
Where is the Necronomicon?

638
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:18,145
I'll need it to stop Erla's evil plans.

639
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:19,855
Uwe?

640
00:48:20,106 --> 00:48:22,149
Is there a problem?

641
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,443
No, no. Everything's fine.

642
00:48:25,486 --> 00:48:27,738
So, the Necronomicon.

643
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:31,409
Erla mustn't get her hands on it.

644
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:36,330
That's part of the problem.
Erla took it when she abducted Ophelia.

645
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:37,957
Right. That Erla.

646
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:40,668
Always good for a surprise.

647
00:48:40,835 --> 00:48:43,337
But it's time we got going.

648
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:46,966
- What's the urgency?
- Ha! He's forgotten.

649
00:48:47,133 --> 00:48:49,301
We have an appointment with...

650
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,762
- Uwe.
- Uwe? Who's Uwe?

651
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:55,683
You know? Uwe.
I'll explain it to you on the way.

652
00:48:56,851 --> 00:49:00,729
- Arrivederci! Thanks for the drinks.
- The drinks...

653
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:03,858
are a truth serum.

654
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:05,693
A truth...

655
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,905
A... Oh, yes...

656
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:12,616
Indeed. I do feel rather strange.

657
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:15,995
Hey. That's not fair.

658
00:49:16,245 --> 00:49:18,497
Stop playing games.

659
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,589
Erla.

660
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:31,552
And now you will tell me the truth!

661
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:32,928
Okay.

662
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:36,015
If I were you,
I'd have kept Diandra's looks.

663
00:49:36,182 --> 00:49:38,601
- You're so ugly.
- Ugly's not the word.

664
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:42,688
You owe damages to anyone
who looks at you. Did I say that?

665
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:46,400
The truth serum is working, I see.

666
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:48,527
So...

667
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:50,696
Where is the Necronomicon?

668
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:56,202
- I thought you had it.
- Would I bother with you scum if I did?

669
00:49:56,452 --> 00:49:59,788
Good point.
If somewhat impolitely formulated.

670
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:03,584
Just now she seemed
to find you rather attractive.

671
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,085
- Witches...
- Witches...

672
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:08,672
What is it that you're holding back?

673
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:10,132
Julius.

674
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:14,553
Oh, many things.

675
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:19,058
Mainly how lonely and empty I've been
since Konstanzia left.

676
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:22,978
I tell everyone
how happy I am she's gone

677
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:25,898
and that I need my freedom,
but it's a lie.

678
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:29,068
I still love her. Just look...

679
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:32,112
Isn't she beautiful? My queen.

680
00:50:32,905 --> 00:50:34,406
My sunshine.

681
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:39,119
Cease this sentimental drivel!
I want to know right away...

682
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:42,581
How could we have drifted apart?
It was all my fault.

683
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:45,876
I worked too much
and spent too little time with her.

684
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:48,337
- Now my life has come apart.
- Ah?

685
00:50:49,922 --> 00:50:53,467
I drink, I've let myself go,
I gambled away my fortune.

686
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:58,639
- What is this claptrap you're talking?
- The truth! Nothing but the truth.

687
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:02,560
The only things holding me together
are Charles and Hui Buh.

688
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,562
Is that true, Julius?

689
00:51:05,521 --> 00:51:07,815
Yes, of course.

690
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:11,193
You're a pest.

691
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:15,864
And an absolutely pathetic ghost.
But you're my best friend.

692
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:19,994
And without you
I would have left Burgeck years ago.

693
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,912
You're so right.

694
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,999
I'm the biggest loser
in the phantom world.

695
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:27,918
But you have always stuck by me.

696
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:33,507
You're my best friend, and I am proud
to haunt pathetically in your presence.

697
00:51:33,674 --> 00:51:37,011
- Come here, you old ghost, you.
- Yes.

698
00:51:37,261 --> 00:51:39,263
Shut up, the pair of you!

699
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:41,890
And you, McSpo0k!

700
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:43,934
Where is the Necronomicon?

701
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:46,645
Oh. Oh, that's here.

702
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:51,400
I took it from Ophelia and have been
hiding it in my armor the whole time.

703
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:58,657
Why couldn't you just tell me that
right away?

704
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:01,619
You... You... You did what?

705
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:04,121
I thought it was a good idea.

706
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:08,167
- Quite the contrary.
- Take them to the dungeons!

707
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:09,627
Come on!

708
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:11,670
No! Oh!

709
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:15,424
I could kill you,
but I can't even do that!

710
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:16,925
Yes!

711
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:21,972
Erla, my evil one. At last.
I was expecting that loser of a ghost.

712
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:26,810
- Julius, I can explain everything.
- Save your breath.

713
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,812
I get it. Okay.

714
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,941
- On the count of three?
- Okay. One last time. Three.

715
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:36,403
- Are you still mad?
- I'm not mad.

716
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:38,530
Head!

717
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:43,202
- I'm furious!
- Oh, really?

718
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:48,165
Come on!
I'll make up for it, Julius. Quick!

719
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,125
Get on!

720
00:52:50,376 --> 00:52:51,960
Come on!

721
00:52:52,211 --> 00:52:54,004
- Darn!
- Stop!

722
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:55,464
Hold on!

723
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:58,967
Hui Buh!

724
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:08,310
We certainly showed them.

725
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,896
- We're a great team!
- Team?

726
00:53:11,063 --> 00:53:12,564
We...

727
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:17,528
What kind of...
What kind of team are we?

728
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,532
You lied to us!

729
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:25,077
It's your fault
evil Erla has the Necronomicon

730
00:53:25,244 --> 00:53:27,955
and will rob life energy
from good witches!

731
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:32,376
- But we'll save them all. Together!
- Together?

732
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:35,087
You didn't care
about Ophelia, Maria or me!

733
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:38,924
- I just wanted...
- Yes, you wanted to be spooky.

734
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:42,302
- Shall I tell you what you really were?
- No.

735
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,263
Stupid!

736
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:45,806
Selfish!

737
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:46,974
Irresponsible!

738
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:50,102
And worst of all, you were a bad friend.

739
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:53,605
This is how our teamwork will be now.

740
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:57,192
I'll save Ophelia and Maria
and you stay out of my way.

741
00:53:57,443 --> 00:54:00,946
I never want to see you again.
You disappointment.

742
00:54:14,585 --> 00:54:17,463
You losers will never defeat Erla

743
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:20,132
if you don't stick together.

744
00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:24,386
- Old Gingerbread.
- I thought you wanted to leave the wood?

745
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:27,556
Shut up and listen, blob-brain.

746
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:31,518
I read something in this dumb-ass book.

747
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:35,022
It says,
"A friend in need is a friend indeed."

748
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:37,524
And so I thought to myself,

749
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:40,235
if I help out you couple of nobodies,

750
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:42,821
there might be a whatchamacallit

751
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:45,365
between us, a...

752
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:48,535
bonding, you know?

753
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:52,748
- And then we'll be real friends.
- You see, Julius?

754
00:54:52,915 --> 00:54:55,167
"A friend in need is a friend indeed."

755
00:54:55,334 --> 00:54:57,836
Only you're the source of the need.

756
00:54:58,003 --> 00:55:01,590
- Right.
- Don't walk out on us, dum-dum.

757
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:06,428
We can only defeat Erla and save
your friends if we work together.

758
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:07,846
Or...

759
00:55:08,514 --> 00:55:11,475
do you want to leave them in the lurch?

760
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:17,147
Besides the fact that Erla will cover
the Earth in a cloak of darkness.

761
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,570
Fine. We'll save them and get the book.

762
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:26,949
After that, I'll leave Burgeck
and start a new life.

763
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:29,952
You can go plague someone else.

764
00:55:30,202 --> 00:55:33,205
That wasn't so hard, was it,
you boneheads?

765
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:37,376
Come on, let's go smash Erla.

766
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:39,127
Smash, yeah.

767
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:50,264
Here! This is my most hideous
item of clothing.

768
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:59,898
- I said it wouldn't work.
- You were right.

769
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:05,070
- The bad witches will rip you to shreds.
- We need to be more optimistic.

770
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:09,408
What if Erla asks him
to perform a spell?

771
00:56:09,575 --> 00:56:12,828
- You thought of that, wise guy?
- That's easy!

772
00:56:12,995 --> 00:56:15,706
We do something similar
in our spook show.

773
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:17,708
Cast a spell, Julius.

774
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:20,252
Go on!

775
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:34,474
If you leave out the "hoo hoo" junk,
it just might work. Hang on.

776
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:39,104
This here might help.

777
00:56:41,565 --> 00:56:43,358
It's my last one.

778
00:56:43,609 --> 00:56:45,110
What is it?

779
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,862
Is it a...

780
00:56:47,863 --> 00:56:50,657
- A magic cookie?
- Go on, down the hatch.

781
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:03,962
Tastes nasty.

782
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:07,799
That's because it's made
mainly from bat poop.

783
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:12,679
- But I added a little cinnamon.
- Thanks for that.

784
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:15,557
Bat poop harbors great power.

785
00:57:16,058 --> 00:57:18,769
No, the whole cookie. And chew it well.

786
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:20,979
Or the magic won't work.

787
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,983
Witchcraft is for connoisseurs.

788
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:43,126
That's the nastiest thing
I've ever eaten in my entire life.

789
00:57:43,377 --> 00:57:45,212
- What?
- That's...

790
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:53,387
I hope for your sake
the magic is pretty darn good.

791
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:56,139
Peppermint?

792
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:01,436
I think it's beginning.

793
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,690
I'd say so.

794
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:09,820
- Well, that's...
- Incredible.

795
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:11,947
Incredibly ugly.

796
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:17,703
May I?

797
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:21,957
- I like you much better that way.
- Oh yeah?

798
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:23,834
Yes. But now, hurry.

799
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:28,296
The magic usually holds a few hours,
but the cookie was stale.

800
00:58:28,547 --> 00:58:31,383
- So you never know.
- Yes, so it would seem.

801
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:33,760
Now don't make a fuss, princess.

802
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:36,013
- Here.
- Fantastic.

803
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:39,725
Let's go.
We'll discuss the details on the way.

804
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:43,854
So, we sneak inside, find the dungeon,
free Ophelia and Maria.

805
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:48,483
We use the element of surprise,
grab the Necronomicon, and that's that.

806
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:51,862
You're going to die.

807
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:56,283
- And I'll keep watch out here.
- Don't we have a Plan B?

808
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:58,660
Plan B? Well...

809
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:02,539
If I don't hear from you in an hour,
I'll scram.

810
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:07,419
- Well, here goes nothing.
- That's what I'm afraid of.

811
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:14,259
See you around.

812
00:59:27,314 --> 00:59:32,069
You dummies never seen a witch before?
Stop eyeballing and let me in!

813
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:35,906
Not bad! You could easily be
Gingerbread's sister...

814
00:59:36,073 --> 00:59:38,867
Shh!
These doors have more than just eyes.

815
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:44,456
That you always have to complain
to get something done!

816
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:47,918
Skull of snake.

817
00:59:53,882 --> 00:59:57,844
- Ashes of corpse.
- What's cooking? A magic potion?

818
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:00,472
No, a four-course meal.

819
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:05,811
Yes, a magic potion.
Probably to access the Underworld.

820
01:00:06,061 --> 01:00:09,648
And what do they need
all those little piggies for?

821
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:11,316
No idea.

822
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:13,068
Come on.

823
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:22,661
Hobble a bit quicker,
before that cookie wears off.

824
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:27,791
We have a new guest.

825
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:33,839
Sister, would you do us the honor
of introducing yourself to us all?

826
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:35,507
Who, m...

827
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:38,969
- Who, me?
- What is your name?

828
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:42,430
- Honored sister witch.
- My name...

829
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:44,432
My name?

830
01:00:45,934 --> 01:00:46,977
My name.

831
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:50,230
My name is...

832
01:00:51,523 --> 01:00:52,941
Thingy...

833
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:55,986
- Majig.
- Thingy Majig?

834
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:59,698
Thingy Majig.

835
01:00:59,865 --> 01:01:03,160
It was my mother's idea.
She was very forgetful.

836
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:08,665
I have never heard of you before,
Sister Thingy Majig.

837
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:10,584
- Oh, well.
- Come...

838
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:13,128
forward.

839
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,384
Come forward...

840
01:01:20,427 --> 01:01:22,053
Of course.

841
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:23,680
Gladly.

842
01:01:36,151 --> 01:01:39,404
And now... make your offering.

843
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:42,991
My offering. Of course.

844
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:51,708
I did have it with me somewhere.
My offering...

845
01:01:54,836 --> 01:01:57,339
- Now.
- Well, you know, at my age... Ah!

846
01:01:58,256 --> 01:01:59,424
No.

847
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:01,801
Here.

848
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:07,933
Could take hours...

849
01:02:09,643 --> 01:02:11,519
A...

850
01:02:15,106 --> 01:02:17,567
salami-flavored candy stick.

851
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:21,988
That will definitely open
the door to Hell. Right?

852
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:25,992
Salami flavor?
That isn't mentioned in here.

853
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:37,712
Have we overlooked something?

854
01:02:37,963 --> 01:02:41,341
Ah, chuck it in.
It sounds good and it can't hurt.

855
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:47,389
Chuck it in.

856
01:02:50,517 --> 01:02:53,311
There's... something...

857
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:57,023
I don't like about you,
Sister Thingy Majig.

858
01:02:57,274 --> 01:02:59,734
Let go of me, hamster brains!

859
01:03:00,277 --> 01:03:02,195
I have witches' rights!

860
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:07,409
- You can't detain me here, poopfaces!
- We found her lurking outside.

861
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:12,038
- She was watching the castle.
- Oh, if it isn't my old friend.

862
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:16,334
The Gingerbread Witch.
What were you doing out there?

863
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:19,462
Farting around in the woods.
What are you doing?

864
01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:23,967
- Smells like my shoe cupboard.
- What is going on with you?

865
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:28,388
Excuse me. Incontinence calls.

866
01:03:29,431 --> 01:03:32,100
I gotta go! To the little witches' room.

867
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:36,521
Before I make a big mess here.

868
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:40,567
- What are you doing here?
- I could ask the same, hooded crow.

869
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:45,822
- That was close.
- It certainly was.

870
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:49,659
- Let's find the dungeon.
- Walk through the walls and check?

871
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:53,455
These walls are spook-proof.
I can't beat witchcraft.

872
01:03:53,621 --> 01:03:55,081
Where is Diandra?

873
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:57,876
Tell me... How old are you?

874
01:03:58,126 --> 01:04:01,588
I expect you have
a good few years left in you.

875
01:04:01,755 --> 01:04:05,925
- Four or five hundred, I'd say.
- Never ask a lady her age.

876
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:07,969
Go stuff yourself!

877
01:04:10,722 --> 01:04:13,183
Well, she wanted to go to Diandra.

878
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:16,853
Take her to her and the others.

879
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:20,982
That hideous hag.
She's turned the good witches into pigs.

880
01:04:21,149 --> 01:04:24,819
Not so stupid. They don't pose a threat
to her that way.

881
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:29,741
Fetch Ophelia and her mother.

882
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:31,826
We're nearly ready.

883
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:50,428
- The door.
- What about it'?

884
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:03,566
Get the other prisoner. I'll wait here.

885
01:05:04,192 --> 01:05:06,319
There she is.

886
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:15,954
I'll distract the guards.
You go invisible and set them free.

887
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:19,207
- And then?
- Then I'll come back and...

888
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:22,961
- We'll improvise.
- That's my specialist area.

889
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:27,132
- Hello?
- Let's see how this works out.

890
01:05:27,382 --> 01:05:29,801
- Get away from the door!
- Or what?

891
01:05:29,968 --> 01:05:33,221
- You'll do nothing until Erla says so.
- That will be soon.

892
01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:34,556
- Ophelia!
- Mom!

893
01:05:34,806 --> 01:05:37,517
- Ophelia!
- Erla wants to see you both.

894
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:39,727
- Mom!
- Ophelia!

895
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:44,899
- Are you okay?
- I was worried about you.

896
01:05:46,985 --> 01:05:50,113
Get out.
Erla doesn't like to be kept waiting.

897
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:55,827
- We'll be fine.
- Excuse me, ladies!

898
01:05:56,077 --> 01:05:58,663
I came to the cellar looking for wine.

899
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:01,916
But all I've found
is you two wrinkled grapes.

900
01:06:02,167 --> 01:06:04,669
How impudent. Get inside there!

901
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:07,464
- Let's get him.
- Do forgive me.

902
01:06:07,714 --> 01:06:09,090
After him!

903
01:06:13,136 --> 01:06:15,597
That was King Julius. We'll be fine now.

904
01:06:15,847 --> 01:06:19,100
- If he's here, then Hui Buh...
- can't be far away!

905
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:20,602
Hui Buh!

906
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:24,522
- As always, you're in trouble.
- I knew you'd help us.

907
01:06:24,772 --> 01:06:26,524
Super-naturally.

908
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:35,283
Stop!

909
01:07:13,613 --> 01:07:15,615
- Thanks, Hui Buh.
- I must say something.

910
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:17,408
Before Julius returns.

911
01:07:17,659 --> 01:07:20,870
- What do you mean?
- It's my fault Erla has the book.

912
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:24,040
I took it while you were fetching Uwe.

913
01:07:24,207 --> 01:07:26,626
- What?
- I only wanted to borrow it.

914
01:07:26,793 --> 01:07:29,254
But then Erla showed up, and... Well...

915
01:07:29,504 --> 01:07:33,716
- Stealing from your own niece.
- I know. I've let everyone down.

916
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:36,553
Just so I could be a spooky spook.

917
01:07:40,682 --> 01:07:44,978
I don't care whether you're spooky.
You'll always be my favorite ghost.

918
01:07:46,104 --> 01:07:47,647
- Really?
- Really.

919
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,899
We have to get out of here! Quick!

920
01:07:50,567 --> 01:07:52,151
- Let's go!
- Your Majesty?

921
01:07:52,944 --> 01:07:55,572
"Julius" will do. The guards are coming.

922
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:58,408
- I don't know how much time we have.
- None.

923
01:08:00,285 --> 01:08:03,496
Not one step further. We've got you now.

924
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:07,041
- Can't you do some magic?
- Without our wands?

925
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:09,752
Hang on. Look up there!

926
01:08:20,555 --> 01:08:21,639
Charles!

927
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:25,310
<i>- You got</i> my <i>message then?
- Bien sur, mon capitaine!</i>

928
01:08:25,476 --> 01:08:29,480
- I 'ope I'm not too late?
- Perfectly timed, as always.

929
01:08:29,731 --> 01:08:31,941
Non, non. It's just...

930
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:36,696
Your Majesty, I know how much
you sweat in that flight jacket.

931
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:40,908
You forgot to take along any deodorant.

932
01:08:43,703 --> 01:08:46,914
Oh, that's very. That's really very...

933
01:08:47,165 --> 01:08:48,666
considerate of you.

934
01:08:49,876 --> 01:08:52,170
- Mon <i>Dieu!</i>
- The gate to the Underworld!

935
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:56,257
- We have to get out!
- There's no time.

936
01:08:56,507 --> 01:08:58,885
- Let's get out of here!
- Move, move!

937
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:02,055
We're going to need this.

938
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:03,681
Go!

939
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:22,367
- Is there another exit?
- None I know of.

940
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:35,088
I have an idea. All of you have to die.

941
01:09:35,254 --> 01:09:39,634
- You become ghosts and turn invisible.
- That's what we'll do.

942
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:42,553
That was sarcasm, right?

943
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:47,975
Invisible.
Hui Buh, that's the right idea!

944
01:09:48,226 --> 01:09:50,436
The guards took my magic powder.

945
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:54,691
I don't need powder.
When I was small I did it with my wand.

946
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:57,151
Wow. But that's pretty high level.

947
01:09:57,652 --> 01:10:00,154
- Wait, when was that?
- Umm...

948
01:10:00,822 --> 01:10:04,575
- Remember when the kitchen blew up'?
- What? That was you?

949
01:10:04,826 --> 01:10:06,661
- How often have i...
- Ladies!

950
01:10:06,828 --> 01:10:08,871
We don't have time for this.

951
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:12,792
- Where are the prisoners?
- One moment, Erla.

952
01:10:15,086 --> 01:10:19,507
How can we be sure we will get
our fair share of the life energy?

953
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:23,344
Right, then.
Ophelia, you make us all invisible.

954
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:25,805
We three will get the pigs.
And Hui Buh...

955
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:29,142
- Grab the book as soon as we're gone.
- Got it.

956
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:32,437
<i>Oui!</i>

957
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:38,943
After all,
each one of us contributed an offering

958
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:41,446
so we would get more years of life.

959
01:10:41,696 --> 01:10:43,781
How right you are.

960
01:10:44,407 --> 01:10:48,369
Whoever claimed
that you can put your trust in me?

961
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:53,958
You will each get what you deserve.

962
01:11:17,398 --> 01:11:19,358
- It works!
- She did it!

963
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:37,251
Uwe! Get away!

964
01:11:40,838 --> 01:11:42,256
Quiet.

965
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:50,097
Oops.

966
01:11:50,348 --> 01:11:54,393
You're beginning to get on my nerves.
So I'll keep this short.

967
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,687
Hurl them into the cauldron!

968
01:12:01,275 --> 01:12:04,195
Come on, get moving. Come on!

969
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:07,323
- Nice to see you again.
- You.

970
01:12:07,949 --> 01:12:10,159
- You'll be first.
- Ophelia!

971
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:12,119
- No!
- Stop!

972
01:12:13,663 --> 01:12:17,250
That is, if you care
what happens to this old tome.

973
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:22,380
- Biggest fan, what are you doing?
- Makes you feel warm all over, huh?

974
01:12:22,547 --> 01:12:24,674
- Let my friends go!
- What?

975
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:28,219
- You don't dare!
- You're probably right.

976
01:12:28,386 --> 01:12:31,806
But I'm very clumsy
and I might drop it in the fire.

977
01:12:32,056 --> 01:12:35,226
I can confirm that.
He 'as two left 'ands.

978
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:39,230
Shut your trap, you!
We're in negotiations here.

979
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:43,609
First of all,
you will give the book to me

980
01:12:44,068 --> 01:12:46,529
and then I will let your friends go.

981
01:12:46,696 --> 01:12:50,241
- Don't! She's lying!
- With the book, she's unstoppable.

982
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:55,538
Sounds like a great offer. I advise you
to take it up, as my biggest fan.

983
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:58,583
- Save your friends!
- Now I should save them?

984
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:02,461
I thought they were stopping me
becoming the spookiest spook?

985
01:13:02,712 --> 01:13:05,923
But if I were to fling you
into the flames,

986
01:13:06,173 --> 01:13:07,800
I'd be a real terror.

987
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:09,635
Stop! All right!

988
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:13,931
I'll perform a spell
and turn you into the spookiest spook.

989
01:13:14,181 --> 01:13:17,602
Your biggest dream.
Everything you ever wanted.

990
01:13:17,768 --> 01:13:21,731
- And my friends can go?
- I swear, by the forces of darkness.

991
01:13:21,981 --> 01:13:25,818
Well, "by the forces of darkness"
sounds trustworthy.

992
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:29,196
- Agreed.
- Oh!

993
01:13:29,447 --> 01:13:33,868
Give me the book!

994
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:37,997
Gladly. But first I get my free spell.
Now, listen...

995
01:13:42,126 --> 01:13:44,045
You can't be serious!

996
01:13:44,295 --> 01:13:48,674
- You bet your hide I am.
- All right, then. I accept your spell.

997
01:13:48,925 --> 01:13:53,012
Much appreciated.
Here, Erla. You can have this old tome.

998
01:13:56,474 --> 01:13:58,559
<i>Clatu verata nectu!</i>

999
01:14:01,812 --> 01:14:03,731
What's going on now?

1000
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:14,659
What are you staring at?

1001
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:16,369
Get them!

1002
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:20,206
What's that?

1003
01:14:20,373 --> 01:14:25,628
- How did this happen?
- All evil magic should turn good.

1004
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:29,382
My free spell.
It's what Ophelia would have asked for.

1005
01:14:29,548 --> 01:14:32,843
There's nothing I can do. It's valid.
For all time.

1006
01:14:33,344 --> 01:14:36,263
Then you're nothing but wastepaper!

1007
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:40,685
Congratulations.
That's it for the "spookiest spook."

1008
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:43,312
Now you're simply laughable.

1009
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:48,025
I don't mind. My friends think
I'm the funniest ghost in the world.

1010
01:14:48,275 --> 01:14:52,780
- What more could I want?
- He's sacrificed his big dream for us.

1011
01:14:54,365 --> 01:14:58,077
Come on, sisters! This isn't over yet!

1012
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:01,706
I was thinking the same thing.

1013
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:06,293
That belongs to me.

1014
01:15:06,877 --> 01:15:08,379
My sister.

1015
01:15:10,881 --> 01:15:14,218
Erla's magic is over.
You're the best, Hui Buh.

1016
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:27,815
Well, nibble my nuts.

1017
01:15:35,156 --> 01:15:37,241
Here, little witch. Have this.

1018
01:15:37,408 --> 01:15:39,910
Conjure up all sorts of fun things.

1019
01:15:40,161 --> 01:15:42,038
- Hang on!
- Thank you.

1020
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:44,790
- I want a pink unicorn.
- No!

1021
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:46,542
Oh God!

1022
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:51,130
So... i guess I'm not the only one
who underestimated you.

1023
01:15:53,174 --> 01:15:57,011
- Friends again?
- Who else would I nag?

1024
01:15:58,345 --> 01:16:00,139
Come here, you.

1025
01:16:00,598 --> 01:16:02,892
- To the dungeons with her.
- Get up.

1026
01:16:03,059 --> 01:16:05,394
No! Get off!

1027
01:16:05,644 --> 01:16:07,980
Let go of me!

1028
01:16:08,147 --> 01:16:10,149
Get your filthy paws off me! No!

1029
01:16:10,316 --> 01:16:13,944
Well, if it isn't
my two new best friends.

1030
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:16,906
We were a bunch
of lucky swine, weren't we?

1031
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:20,493
I always knew I could count
on these no-hopers.

1032
01:16:22,328 --> 01:16:25,998
All the good witches
owe a debt of gratitude to you.

1033
01:16:26,165 --> 01:16:31,087
- What will happen to Erla?
- She will receive her just punishment.

1034
01:16:31,962 --> 01:16:35,382
Your Majesty, we must go.
I have coq au vin in the oven.

1035
01:16:35,549 --> 01:16:39,637
You're right, Charles. It's high time...
Where's my...

1036
01:16:40,137 --> 01:16:41,806
Looking for this?

1037
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:45,935
Thank you, old friend. So...

1038
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:50,648
Right then, Your Highness.

1039
01:16:50,898 --> 01:16:55,152
- I hope you will visit us at Burgeck.
- I won't miss that opportunity.

1040
01:17:00,783 --> 01:17:06,497
- What's the thing with his watch?
- I have a plan, sis. Can you help me?

1041
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:12,586
THE HAUNT OF THE FUNNIEST GHOST

1042
01:17:15,131 --> 01:17:19,093
Come on, everyone! Say "Squeeeal." Yes!

1043
01:17:19,343 --> 01:17:21,846
Bravo! And the next two.

1044
01:17:22,096 --> 01:17:24,140
Don't crowd.

1045
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:27,685
- You all get a pic with the funny ghost!
- Hey, Uwe!

1046
01:17:27,852 --> 01:17:30,437
<i>Vite, Vite, mademoiselle!
Get 'm the mature.</i>

1047
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:32,898
Bravo! And...

1048
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:36,318
Hui Buh!

1049
01:17:36,569 --> 01:17:37,695
- Yes!
- Bravo!

1050
01:17:37,862 --> 01:17:39,363
So, next. Go on.

1051
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:42,616
Your Majesty,
may I speak with you a moment?

1052
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:44,702
But of course.

1053
01:17:45,202 --> 01:17:48,372
During our adventure together,
I noticed something.

1054
01:17:48,539 --> 01:17:51,625
I... Of course, you're right.
I'm not blind.

1055
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:55,796
You're a beautiful woman, and I am...

1056
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:58,048
Well, a king.

1057
01:17:58,299 --> 01:18:01,218
- Well, if I'm honest...
- Please, say no more.

1058
01:18:01,468 --> 01:18:03,721
I truly feel very flattered.

1059
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:09,226
And under different circumstances,
I would not be averse, but...

1060
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:11,520
my heart belongs to another.

1061
01:18:12,313 --> 01:18:14,023
I know that.

1062
01:18:14,565 --> 01:18:18,235
Everyone knows that,
my old blueblooded pal. And...

1063
01:18:19,403 --> 01:18:21,280
she missed you too.

1064
01:18:25,576 --> 01:18:28,245
But... But... But... How... How...

1065
01:18:28,495 --> 01:18:31,540
It was Hui Buh's idea.
I just called her.

1066
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:34,668
Someone had to take the first step.

1067
01:18:44,637 --> 01:18:46,472
Jack! Jack!

1068
01:18:51,143 --> 01:18:52,353
- I'm so...
- I'm so...

1069
01:18:53,854 --> 01:18:55,648
- I just wanted...
- I just wanted...

1070
01:18:55,814 --> 01:18:57,816
- You first.
- No, you.

1071
01:19:10,329 --> 01:19:12,331
How did you manage that?

1072
01:19:12,915 --> 01:19:15,376
- Some sort of trick, no doubt.
- Yeah.

1073
01:19:15,542 --> 01:19:18,254
That's how we do things in this family.

1074
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:21,674
Jack! Let's get this.

1075
01:19:27,721 --> 01:19:29,640
My queen!

1076
01:19:30,891 --> 01:19:33,060
- And, flash!
- Hui Buh!

1077
01:19:56,375 --> 01:19:58,627
Was the camera running?

1078
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:00,313
- Where are the witches?
- Sacre' <i>bleu!</i>

1079
01:20:00,337 --> 01:20:01,839
Start again?

1080
01:20:02,006 --> 01:20:04,967
Sorry. "SacrÃ© bleu" first.
Keep it running.

1081
01:20:07,344 --> 01:20:09,930
- Sacre' <i>bleu!</i>
- Where are the witches?

1082
01:20:12,182 --> 01:20:14,601
Isn't that truly horrifying?

1083
01:20:14,768 --> 01:20:17,438
- Sorry, I've lost my thread.
- My mistake.

1084
01:20:17,604 --> 01:20:20,399
- Precisely.
- Our spook show has something similar.

1085
01:20:20,566 --> 01:20:23,152
Can we set that up again?
I'll stand here.

1086
01:20:25,029 --> 01:20:26,322
Spooking hell!

1087
01:20:27,531 --> 01:20:29,950
Hey, Julius, should we start over again?

1088
01:20:30,117 --> 01:20:33,537
I'm stuck in here.
Can someone please help me out?

1089
01:20:34,788 --> 01:20:37,374
You don't know the way
to Diandra's castle?

1090
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:39,376
Is this some sort of dumb test?

1091
01:20:42,254 --> 01:20:44,590
I've fallen in love with myself.

1092
01:20:44,757 --> 01:20:48,552
- How is it possible?
- I think Hui... ha-de-ha...

1093
01:20:50,804 --> 01:20:53,682
Your Majesty,
I'm afraid we have to leave...

1094
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:55,684
Sorry. I had a little...

1095
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:59,396
My teeth developed a life of their own.
Forgive me.

1096
01:21:01,732 --> 01:21:04,651
Does she have a weak spot?
Any powerful friends?

1097
01:21:04,818 --> 01:21:07,154
- Powerful enemies.
- Let's do that again.

1098
01:21:07,321 --> 01:21:08,906
I'm so strong, guys.

1099
01:21:09,073 --> 01:21:11,950
It's because of those Czech vegetables.

1100
01:21:16,372 --> 01:21:19,041
If Erla gets the Necroconicom...
What's it called?

1101
01:21:20,376 --> 01:21:23,921
I... Oh! Grrr! Sorry. I apologize!

1102
01:21:24,088 --> 01:21:25,589
There it is!

1103
01:21:26,632 --> 01:21:28,384
Nibble my nuts!

1104
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:31,345
Ni du-bi-du. Let's start again.

1105
01:21:33,389 --> 01:21:36,016
I included a little Kazachok.

1106
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:47,986
I didn't know what to do.

1107
01:21:48,153 --> 01:21:50,155
I need a spine massage.

1108
01:21:50,322 --> 01:21:51,698
Okay.

1109
01:21:56,829 --> 01:22:01,083
Everyone gets a photo
with the funny ghost!

1110
01:22:01,542 --> 01:22:05,045
How does it work again?
I 'ate this technology!

1111
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:11,093
Bravo!

1112
01:22:18,684 --> 01:22:20,269
And? How was I'?
