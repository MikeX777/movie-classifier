1
00:02:57,002 --> 00:02:58,917
And then there was something
on the 12th.

2
00:02:58,917 --> 00:03:00,267
What was it?
Something to do with...

3
00:03:00,267 --> 00:03:01,529
My brother’s
graduation.

4
00:03:01,529 --> 00:03:02,791
Oh, right. Oh, yeah.

5
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,096
I forgot.

6
00:03:04,096 --> 00:03:05,359
I know
it sounds ridiculous,

7
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:06,838
but I’m in
the wedding party.

8
00:03:06,838 --> 00:03:08,449
My parents are not
asking for a wedding.

9
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:10,102
It would
be just like

10
00:03:10,102 --> 00:03:11,495
no one would be able
to come.

11
00:03:11,495 --> 00:03:13,149
So we’re hoping,
at the end of June,

12
00:03:13,149 --> 00:03:14,716
but we plan to be...

13
00:03:14,716 --> 00:03:15,978
Should we lie?

14
00:03:15,978 --> 00:03:17,197
We don’t have to.

15
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,459
Okay.

16
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:20,635
Matt, what happened?

17
00:03:24,682 --> 00:03:26,641
Alice, the boat,
you know how it is.

18
00:03:26,641 --> 00:03:28,077
It broke down again.

19
00:03:28,077 --> 00:03:31,298
Don’t you lie to me.
Now get in here.

20
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:38,609
May I? Thanks.

21
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:39,871
Hello.

22
00:03:39,871 --> 00:03:41,221
Hey, Pats, how you doing?

23
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,397
Looking good.

24
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:48,053
I want you.

25
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:54,756
You got me.

26
00:03:54,756 --> 00:03:56,453
Where’s your tie?
Huh?

27
00:03:56,453 --> 00:03:57,715
Oh, no tie.

28
00:03:57,715 --> 00:03:59,543
Hey.Hey!

29
00:03:59,543 --> 00:04:01,023
How are you doing?

30
00:04:01,023 --> 00:04:03,025
It’s bachelorette
number three, huh?

31
00:04:03,025 --> 00:04:04,896
I wanted you to meet

32
00:04:04,896 --> 00:04:07,072
our oldest and dearest friends,
Dr. and Mrs. Oppenheimer.

33
00:04:07,072 --> 00:04:09,336
Oh.This is Sam. This is Lila.

34
00:04:09,336 --> 00:04:11,816
How do you do?Kyle and Jeannie Larkin,

35
00:04:11,816 --> 00:04:13,644
who will be, of course,
Alice’s future in-laws.

36
00:04:13,644 --> 00:04:14,906
How nice.

37
00:04:14,906 --> 00:04:16,821
Look, look,
all I was saying before

38
00:04:16,821 --> 00:04:18,997
was that it was unfair
to me for you two... What?

39
00:04:18,997 --> 00:04:21,173
Does this look stupid?A little.

40
00:04:21,173 --> 00:04:22,914
It’s unfair to me
for you two to get engaged.

41
00:04:22,914 --> 00:04:25,787
That’s all I’m saying.It was unfair to you?

42
00:04:25,787 --> 00:04:27,702
Mm-hmm. How does this
make Maureen feel?

43
00:04:27,702 --> 00:04:29,225
Look at her.
She’s ready to go now.

44
00:04:29,225 --> 00:04:31,227
She’s going to come at me.
It’s your fault.

45
00:04:31,227 --> 00:04:32,663
Hi.

46
00:04:32,663 --> 00:04:34,578
Congratulations, guy.

47
00:04:34,578 --> 00:04:36,450
Thanks.

48
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,799
Tipton.

49
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:39,366
Fairgate.

50
00:04:42,586 --> 00:04:44,588
What a slob.

51
00:04:44,588 --> 00:04:46,286
If I had stayed
with my last boyfriend,

52
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,939
I wonder if we would
have ended up

53
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:49,724
with an engagement party
like this

54
00:04:49,724 --> 00:04:51,813
and marriage
and the whole thing?

55
00:04:51,813 --> 00:04:56,121
When I canned him, he said,

56
00:04:56,121 --> 00:04:59,124
"If you ever
change your mind...

57
00:04:59,124 --> 00:05:00,430
ever..."

58
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,085
I won’t, but...

59
00:05:04,782 --> 00:05:08,786
I thought it was
a decent thing to say.

60
00:05:08,786 --> 00:05:11,049
Just born to be
a heartbreaker, Ellen.

61
00:05:11,049 --> 00:05:12,312
Nothing you can do
about it.

62
00:05:15,793 --> 00:05:17,665
I guess.

63
00:05:19,797 --> 00:05:21,799
Ladies and gentlemen.

64
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:25,368
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please.

65
00:05:25,368 --> 00:05:27,283
Just a moment.

66
00:05:28,806 --> 00:05:30,808
To my daughter
and to Matt,

67
00:05:30,808 --> 00:05:32,332
to their engagement,

68
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,725
and may June
come quickly.

69
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:53,396
If the reflux ratio
is decreased continuously,

70
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:56,138
a second limiting condition
is reached,

71
00:05:56,138 --> 00:05:59,097
at which the reflux ratio
becomes a minimum.

72
00:05:59,097 --> 00:06:00,664
What would be
the required number

73
00:06:00,664 --> 00:06:02,013
of plates

74
00:06:02,013 --> 00:06:04,886
at the condition
of a minimum reflux ratio?

75
00:06:06,496 --> 00:06:08,324
Mr. Fletcher?

76
00:06:12,197 --> 00:06:14,939
Infinite.

77
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:17,202
The answer is infinite.Infinite.

78
00:06:17,202 --> 00:06:19,727
Thank you,
Mr. Fletcher,

79
00:06:19,727 --> 00:06:22,251
but your ventriloquist
won’t be there on exam day.

80
00:06:24,906 --> 00:06:27,735
Where will you be?

81
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:36,091
Hi, Michelle.

82
00:06:36,091 --> 00:06:37,745
Mr. Burke, how are you, sir?

83
00:06:37,745 --> 00:06:39,573
How are you?

84
00:06:39,573 --> 00:06:41,183
Say, buddy,
how’s it going?

85
00:06:41,183 --> 00:06:43,359
Say.
Larkin, this is Sproles.

86
00:06:43,359 --> 00:06:45,927
Hi. Matt.
O.W.

87
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:48,059
Sproles took me to this house
in the country last night.

88
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:49,365
What house?

89
00:06:49,365 --> 00:06:50,627
What was
that woman’s name again?

90
00:06:50,627 --> 00:06:52,412
Jean.
Right.

91
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,631
This woman named Jean lives
there, has this constant party.

92
00:06:54,631 --> 00:06:56,067
Well, I don’t know
if it’s constant...

93
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:57,721
I talked to some guys
who were there.

94
00:06:57,721 --> 00:06:59,549
They said it was like
a perpetual house of party.

95
00:06:59,549 --> 00:07:00,811
What guys?

96
00:07:00,811 --> 00:07:02,160
I don’t know,
just these guys.

97
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,640
Her friends are some
rough characters.

98
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,946
That doesn’t
bother us because...

99
00:07:04,946 --> 00:07:06,208
My brother’s
an undercover cop.

100
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,514
Nobody hassles us.

101
00:07:07,514 --> 00:07:09,341
What'd you do there?

102
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:11,256
Uh, I don’t know.
What did we do?

103
00:07:11,256 --> 00:07:12,736
We just hung.

104
00:07:12,736 --> 00:07:14,390
Yeah, yeah, my brother knows
a lot of joints

105
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,696
off the beaten...
You know, track.

106
00:07:15,696 --> 00:07:17,175
Yeah, but listen,
this one’s hip.

107
00:07:17,175 --> 00:07:18,699
I’m taking your ass
over there tonight.

108
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:20,875
I’m an engaged man,
Tip, remember?

109
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,224
Parties will never
be the same.

110
00:07:22,224 --> 00:07:23,791
Come on, Larkin.

111
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,446
Why would I want to go

112
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,273
to some house
in the country, anyway?

113
00:07:28,273 --> 00:07:30,275
Because...It’s outrageous, man.

114
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:32,669
Yeah.I got too much to do.

115
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:34,410
Matt...

116
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,499
Matt, you work
too hard, pal.

117
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:38,327
Be like me.
I don’t work.

118
00:07:38,327 --> 00:07:40,155
You know, some day,
you’re a hotshot engineer,

119
00:07:40,155 --> 00:07:41,417
then work.

120
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:43,767
Goodbye.

121
00:07:43,767 --> 00:07:45,943
Your next lucky number
in this bingo game

122
00:07:45,943 --> 00:07:49,686
is O-75.

123
00:07:49,686 --> 00:07:51,688
7-5, under the O.

124
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,344
Well, I can’t believe

125
00:07:55,344 --> 00:07:56,954
that didn’t do it
for somebody.

126
00:07:56,954 --> 00:08:00,349
Now, you got
that lucky red dress on.

127
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:02,743
You must be
coming close, Sandra.

128
00:08:04,788 --> 00:08:06,181
N-41.

129
00:08:06,181 --> 00:08:08,183
That’s 4-1
under the N.

130
00:08:08,183 --> 00:08:09,532
Bingo!

131
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:11,708
That’s the name of the game.

132
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:15,233
Check that card, Suede,
my very good friend,

133
00:08:15,233 --> 00:08:17,497
and remember, sports fans,
don’t clear your cards

134
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:21,065
until this race is announced...
official.

135
00:08:21,065 --> 00:08:23,590
These people are older, Matt,
but I like that.

136
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,243
I feel comfortable
around them, personally.

137
00:08:25,243 --> 00:08:27,637
Uh-huh.No, do I flatter myself?

138
00:08:27,637 --> 00:08:29,291
I don’t think so.

139
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,989
Am I going to spend the rest
of my life with these people?

140
00:08:31,989 --> 00:08:33,556
I doubt that too,
but it’s just that...

141
00:08:33,556 --> 00:08:35,993
well, who are we

142
00:08:35,993 --> 00:08:37,604
unless we sample
a little of this,

143
00:08:37,604 --> 00:08:39,823
try a little of that,

144
00:08:39,823 --> 00:08:41,346
sample some
more of this.

145
00:08:41,346 --> 00:08:43,087
I don’t know, who are we?

146
00:08:43,087 --> 00:08:44,567
It’s just that...
That element, that...

147
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:48,440
these people
have lived a little.

148
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,964
Okay, unsavory?

149
00:08:49,964 --> 00:08:51,226
I’m not going to say
they’re not,

150
00:08:51,226 --> 00:08:52,706
but that can be appealing.

151
00:08:52,706 --> 00:08:55,535
Yeah. Absolutely.
Unsavory's my favorite.

152
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,927
I wasn’t going
to tell you this,

153
00:08:56,927 --> 00:08:58,668
I was going to let you
find out for yourself

154
00:08:58,668 --> 00:09:00,191
when you
came out there.

155
00:09:00,191 --> 00:09:02,411
The night I was there with
Sproles, I met this girl.

156
00:09:02,411 --> 00:09:04,152
She’s a friend of
the woman who owns the place.

157
00:09:04,152 --> 00:09:05,414
Uh-huh.

158
00:09:05,414 --> 00:09:06,937
Hello.Hi, Ellen.

159
00:09:06,937 --> 00:09:08,199
Hello.

160
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:09,897
May June
come quickly.

161
00:09:09,897 --> 00:09:11,289
Anyway, I met this chick, and
she’s...

162
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:12,552
Well, she’s like,
she loves me.

163
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,857
She’s head over heels
over me.

164
00:09:13,857 --> 00:09:15,598
Like you would go
out on Maureen.

165
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:16,860
Hey, Matt!

166
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,863
I might.

167
00:09:19,863 --> 00:09:21,343
Come on,
let’s go out there.

168
00:09:21,343 --> 00:09:22,910
You don’t have
to move in.

169
00:09:57,901 --> 00:09:59,468
Okay, just watch me,
all right?

170
00:09:59,468 --> 00:10:00,687
What are you
going to do?

171
00:10:00,687 --> 00:10:02,036
Watch how I act.

172
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:03,820
Watch how I make myself
at home, all right?

173
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,909
That’s what you do here.
That’s how you act, okay?

174
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:07,389
Okay?

175
00:10:09,434 --> 00:10:12,350
♪ I done run into my baby

176
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:17,921
♪ And finally found
My old blue jeans ♪

177
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:29,150
♪ Well, I done
Ran into my baby ♪

178
00:10:33,807 --> 00:10:39,726
♪ And finally found
my old blue jeans ♪

179
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:41,205
You’re right.

180
00:10:41,205 --> 00:10:43,294
This is exciting.

181
00:10:43,294 --> 00:10:45,688
You want a beer?No.

182
00:10:45,688 --> 00:10:49,387
The kitchen’s that way.
Get me a beer, would you?

183
00:10:49,387 --> 00:10:50,650
Sure, buddy.

184
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,173
Thanks, pal.

185
00:10:52,173 --> 00:10:54,001
Hi.

186
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:55,437
♪ By the oil
And the gasoline, yeah ♪

187
00:10:55,437 --> 00:10:57,831
Good tune, huh?

188
00:11:19,635 --> 00:11:20,767
Excuse me.

189
00:11:25,423 --> 00:11:26,555
I didn’t mean to...

190
00:11:30,124 --> 00:11:32,779
I just came in here to...
get, uh...

191
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:34,345
Is this the refrigerator?

192
00:11:34,345 --> 00:11:37,131
Came in to get
the refrigerator?

193
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:38,262
Huh?

194
00:11:40,743 --> 00:11:45,052
No. Tipton wanted, uh,

195
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:47,576
a beer, actually,
is what he wanted.

196
00:11:52,886 --> 00:11:54,235
Would you mind if I had a...

197
00:11:54,235 --> 00:11:58,500
could I have a sip
of your soda?

198
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:06,073
Oh, I’m sorry.

199
00:12:06,073 --> 00:12:07,335
Kid, no spitting.

200
00:12:07,335 --> 00:12:10,991
Sorry. It’s bourbon.

201
00:12:10,991 --> 00:12:13,776
I was kidding. God.

202
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:15,735
My name’s Jean.

203
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,040
What’s your name?

204
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,912
Matt Larkin.

205
00:12:18,912 --> 00:12:20,827
Matt...

206
00:12:20,827 --> 00:12:23,090
Can I make you
a bacon, lettuce

207
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,439
and tomato sandwich, Matt?

208
00:12:24,439 --> 00:12:26,702
No thanks.

209
00:12:26,702 --> 00:12:27,877
Thank you, no.

210
00:12:30,097 --> 00:12:31,576
So you going to be
coming around or...

211
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:37,017
Uh, maybe.
I don’t know, maybe, yeah.

212
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:41,935
I think you just got
to come around some.

213
00:12:51,074 --> 00:12:52,336
You live here?

214
00:12:52,336 --> 00:12:53,642
No.

215
00:12:57,124 --> 00:12:58,865
No, I don’t either.

216
00:12:58,865 --> 00:13:02,607
I know you don’t.

217
00:13:05,306 --> 00:13:06,873
Supposed to be
a lot of fun here.

218
00:13:06,873 --> 00:13:08,570
Well, Jean likes
to have people around.

219
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,180
It makes her happy.

220
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,878
You in school?
No.

221
00:13:11,878 --> 00:13:13,793
I thought just maybe
we went to college together

222
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,229
and just didn’t know it,
you know?

223
00:13:15,229 --> 00:13:17,797
Yeah...but no.

224
00:13:19,581 --> 00:13:22,236
Yeah, I just came here
because my friend, Tipton,

225
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:24,194
he heard about this place
at school.

226
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:28,895
I just run over here
from my house next door

227
00:13:28,895 --> 00:13:31,419
because my step-daddy come home
with that breath of his

228
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:32,855
and climbed into my bed

229
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:36,163
and laid down
and put his arm around me.

230
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:40,732
Jesus.

231
00:13:42,604 --> 00:13:44,388
Yeah.

232
00:13:46,695 --> 00:13:50,046
What the hell were you doing
in bed at 11:00 in the morning?

233
00:13:50,046 --> 00:13:52,005
I was tired, okay?

234
00:13:52,005 --> 00:13:53,397
I already had
two classes.

235
00:13:53,397 --> 00:13:55,530
Oh, good for you.

236
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,748
I’m really sorry I spit on you.

237
00:13:58,011 --> 00:14:01,144
Didn’t bother me.

238
00:14:01,144 --> 00:14:04,452
Thanks anyway...pal.

239
00:14:11,285 --> 00:14:13,722
Uh...aren’t you going
to introduce me?

240
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:16,029
Jewel, it’s for you, honey.

241
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:17,595
It’s Jewel.

242
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,341
Hello.

243
00:14:31,131 --> 00:14:32,436
No, I can’t talk now.

244
00:14:32,436 --> 00:14:34,874
I can’t talk now
because I’m busy.

245
00:14:43,143 --> 00:14:45,623
If your step-father
gives you a hard time,

246
00:14:45,623 --> 00:14:47,321
maybe you could tell
your boyfriend.

247
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:48,844
Maybe he could
help you out.

248
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,199
That wasn’t my step-father,

249
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:57,940
and I don’t have a boyfriend.

250
00:16:05,442 --> 00:16:07,618
Say...
Say.

251
00:16:07,618 --> 00:16:08,837
What the hell are you doing?

252
00:16:11,927 --> 00:16:13,233
My dad wants to sell her.

253
00:16:13,233 --> 00:16:14,799
No!
Yep.

254
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:16,497
Cathy!

255
00:16:16,497 --> 00:16:18,542
I told him wait till spring,
I’ll clean her up,

256
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:20,457
he gets twice as much,
and we split it.

257
00:16:20,457 --> 00:16:21,719
What, you get half?

258
00:16:21,719 --> 00:16:23,765
Yeah.It’s too much work, pal.

259
00:16:24,896 --> 00:16:26,768
I don’t mind.

260
00:16:26,768 --> 00:16:29,205
Look, Maureen and I are going
to be over at her place tonight.

261
00:16:29,205 --> 00:16:30,946
Why don’t you and Alice
show up, huh?

262
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,604
I thought maybe we’d go back out
to that house, you and me.

263
00:16:36,604 --> 00:16:38,606
No, I’d rather see Maureen,
wouldn’t you?

264
00:16:38,606 --> 00:16:39,737
I mean, Alice.

265
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:48,790
What did you think
of that girl I met out there?

266
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,922
Trouble.

267
00:16:50,922 --> 00:16:52,707
Why do you say that?

268
00:16:52,707 --> 00:16:53,969
You asked me
what I thought.

269
00:16:53,969 --> 00:16:55,623
Come on, Larkin,

270
00:16:55,623 --> 00:16:57,712
I didn’t take you out there
to meet some, you know...

271
00:16:57,712 --> 00:16:59,322
Some what?Some... I don’t know,

272
00:16:59,322 --> 00:17:00,584
whatever...
Whatever she is...

273
00:17:00,584 --> 00:17:01,846
Here, make yourself
useful, huh?

274
00:17:01,846 --> 00:17:04,110
Oh, no, I can’t.
Sorry.

275
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:06,460
I got to...
I got a class.

276
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,678
On Sunday?

277
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:14,033
Yeah, it’s some, uh, medieval
religious heretic seminar.

278
00:17:15,773 --> 00:17:17,123
Goodbye.

279
00:17:17,123 --> 00:17:19,038
Goodbye.

280
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,865
Goodbye Cathy.

281
00:17:34,749 --> 00:17:36,490
Cold?
No.

282
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,752
You?

283
00:17:37,752 --> 00:17:39,797
Fine.

284
00:17:39,797 --> 00:17:42,409
Good.

285
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,284
Let’s see.
You live, um...

286
00:17:50,678 --> 00:17:52,941
Yeah, that way.

287
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:04,735
Are you from
this area?

288
00:18:04,735 --> 00:18:07,129
No.

289
00:18:09,175 --> 00:18:10,480
What’s the matter?

290
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,570
Nothing. No. Nothing.

291
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:16,356
It’s just...
Where are you from?

292
00:18:16,356 --> 00:18:18,619
Well, Florida’s
where I was born.

293
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:21,100
Oh...

294
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,971
I love Florida.

295
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:27,715
Brothers or sisters?

296
00:18:27,715 --> 00:18:29,891
No.

297
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:31,632
I think my step-daddy’s
got a kid somewheres,

298
00:18:31,632 --> 00:18:34,243
but I never seen him.

299
00:18:43,296 --> 00:18:45,167
What’s this place?

300
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:46,864
It used to be
a railroad repair place

301
00:18:46,864 --> 00:18:48,866
a long time ago.

302
00:18:48,866 --> 00:18:53,828
There’s still
some of them standing.

303
00:18:53,828 --> 00:18:56,135
Come on,
I’ll show you.

304
00:19:15,284 --> 00:19:16,590
I come here
sometimes.

305
00:19:20,637 --> 00:19:21,769
To do what?

306
00:19:23,858 --> 00:19:25,425
Just to get away.

307
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,647
You know, I can read your future
with 32 ordinary playing cards.

308
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:18,042
Thirty-two?

309
00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:19,261
Yeah. Ace down
through seven.

310
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:20,610
All four suits.

311
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,221
Or even 18.

312
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,962
Twelve court cards,
four aces and two jokers.

313
00:20:27,748 --> 00:20:29,010
How'd you learn to do that?

314
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:32,622
It’s been passed on down to me.

315
00:20:32,622 --> 00:20:35,451
Shoot, I even got my name
from the cards.

316
00:20:35,451 --> 00:20:36,757
The name Jewel?

317
00:20:36,757 --> 00:20:38,367
It comes from the ruby
in the crown

318
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:39,716
of the Queen of Clubs.

319
00:20:42,589 --> 00:20:44,112
Why didn’t they just
call you Ruby?

320
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,217
What’s the two of hearts mean?

321
00:21:02,217 --> 00:21:03,871
Good fortune.

322
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,090
Success.

323
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:08,963
Good.

324
00:21:08,963 --> 00:21:11,313
Good thing it wasn’t
the two of diamonds, though,

325
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:13,141
because that means
a bad love affair,

326
00:21:13,141 --> 00:21:17,145
friends and relatives
against you.

327
00:21:17,145 --> 00:21:18,712
This could be good,

328
00:21:18,712 --> 00:21:20,496
but there’s no cards
on either side of it,

329
00:21:20,496 --> 00:21:23,064
so I don’t know...

330
00:21:23,064 --> 00:21:24,805
but I got a feeling.

331
00:21:28,939 --> 00:21:31,420
You get feelings
sometimes, don’t you?

332
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,944
Oh, yeah.

333
00:21:33,944 --> 00:21:36,686
I get feelings.

334
00:21:36,686 --> 00:21:38,427
Then believe mine.

335
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,478
And sometimes I can go through
a whole deck of cards

336
00:21:45,478 --> 00:21:48,785
and tell which ones are red
and which ones are black.

337
00:21:48,785 --> 00:21:50,961
From the back?

338
00:21:50,961 --> 00:21:52,702
Yeah.

339
00:21:52,702 --> 00:21:53,834
How do you do that?

340
00:21:55,923 --> 00:21:59,361
I do it by heat.

341
00:22:07,978 --> 00:22:10,154
Can we go now?

342
00:22:25,735 --> 00:22:27,258
I’m telling you,
this is true.

343
00:22:27,258 --> 00:22:28,956
They open the guy, right,

344
00:22:28,956 --> 00:22:30,653
and they find the surgeon's
magnifying goggles

345
00:22:30,653 --> 00:22:32,829
in his stomach
with nothing there from,

346
00:22:32,829 --> 00:22:34,831
like, the last operation.

347
00:22:34,831 --> 00:22:37,138
No, no, I’m telling you, this
happens in hospitals every day.

348
00:22:37,138 --> 00:22:39,880
Listen, Alice, has your father
ever operated on a guy’s spine,

349
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,403
after the operation,
the guy can’t walk?

350
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:42,926
God...

351
00:22:42,926 --> 00:22:44,928
I don’t think so.You have any sense at all?

352
00:22:44,928 --> 00:22:46,408
Well, is it important
to you that I do?

353
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:47,670
Yeah.

354
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:48,932
Did I offend you?
No.

355
00:22:48,932 --> 00:22:50,717
See?You have to work tomorrow night?

356
00:22:50,717 --> 00:22:51,979
Hand me that
extra knife.

357
00:22:51,979 --> 00:22:53,633
You know I do.That one.

358
00:22:53,633 --> 00:22:56,679
Can't we skip the game
and maybe just be alone tonight?

359
00:22:56,679 --> 00:22:58,507
We're here,
Alice.

360
00:22:58,507 --> 00:23:00,988
I know, we've got the rest of
our lives and everything, but...

361
00:23:00,988 --> 00:23:02,816
Is this like the crystal
you were talking about?

362
00:23:02,816 --> 00:23:04,470
See, it’s simple
and elegant. I love that.

363
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,862
Okay, five bucks,

364
00:23:05,862 --> 00:23:08,256
and you give me three points.Please?

365
00:23:08,256 --> 00:23:10,214
Five bucks, and you
give me six points.Sure.

366
00:23:10,214 --> 00:23:12,086
Deal?
Done.

367
00:23:12,086 --> 00:23:13,566
You’re a sucker.
You’re such a sucker.

368
00:23:13,566 --> 00:23:15,002
I’ll tell you why.
First of all,

369
00:23:15,002 --> 00:23:16,220
the guy can’t
throw a long ball.

370
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,483
He can’t run.

371
00:23:17,483 --> 00:23:19,136
Can he run? No.

372
00:23:19,136 --> 00:23:21,225
All right, he can run,
but he drops the ball.

373
00:23:21,225 --> 00:23:23,358
Oh, you've got to see
the China I picked out today.

374
00:23:23,358 --> 00:23:24,620
You'll die.

375
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:27,231
Putting it
in a house?

376
00:23:27,231 --> 00:23:28,494
Well, apartment.

377
00:23:28,494 --> 00:23:30,234
Until we start a family.

378
00:23:30,234 --> 00:23:32,193
Then I got to have a house.

379
00:23:32,193 --> 00:23:33,629
I mean, you're
a sucker, Matt.

380
00:23:33,629 --> 00:23:34,978
You’re just
a sucker.

381
00:23:34,978 --> 00:23:36,850
Yeah?

382
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,460
So, what have you got
to say for yourself?

383
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,722
Nothing.

384
00:23:39,722 --> 00:23:40,984
Nothing?

385
00:23:40,984 --> 00:23:43,465
You have nothing
to say for yourself?

386
00:28:04,987 --> 00:28:06,641
I did this to you.No, you didn’t.

387
00:28:06,641 --> 00:28:08,599
Yes, I did.
This is my fault.

388
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:11,602
Well, I’m thanking
you for it.

389
00:28:11,602 --> 00:28:13,517
N-32!

390
00:28:13,517 --> 00:28:15,389
Three-two
under the N.

391
00:28:15,389 --> 00:28:17,652
I just don’t know
if I’m going to allow it.

392
00:28:17,652 --> 00:28:20,916
Hey, look, you don’t
have anything to say about it.

393
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:23,310
B-8, my friends!
B number-eight.

394
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:25,399
All right, maybe I don’t have
anything to say about it.

395
00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:28,315
Fine. That doesn't mean
I’m going to allow it.

396
00:28:28,315 --> 00:28:31,274
Look, I have
to do it, all right?

397
00:28:33,842 --> 00:28:36,192
My best friend’s
a raving lunatic.

398
00:28:36,192 --> 00:28:37,759
How do you think
that makes me feel?

399
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:39,021
Huh?

400
00:28:42,024 --> 00:28:44,244
I’m not a lunatic.

401
00:28:44,244 --> 00:28:46,507
See? The insane don’t
know they’re insane.

402
00:28:46,507 --> 00:28:47,813
They don’t even realize it.

403
00:28:47,813 --> 00:28:49,989
They have no thought.
No idea.

404
00:28:49,989 --> 00:28:52,731
No awareness.

405
00:28:54,123 --> 00:28:55,472
Tsk-tsk...

406
00:29:04,568 --> 00:29:07,746
Call the damn numbers.

407
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,182
Uh...G-48,
my friends.

408
00:29:09,182 --> 00:29:11,358
Four-eight. Four-eight.

409
00:29:19,496 --> 00:29:21,368
No!

410
00:29:21,368 --> 00:29:23,979
Alice! Matt!
What’s going on?

411
00:29:23,979 --> 00:29:25,111
Alice!

412
00:29:27,504 --> 00:29:29,724
Alice!

413
00:29:29,724 --> 00:29:30,943
What have you
done to her?

414
00:29:30,943 --> 00:29:32,118
Alice!

415
00:29:35,512 --> 00:29:37,514
Alice, come on, now.

416
00:29:37,514 --> 00:29:39,865
Alice?

417
00:29:39,865 --> 00:29:41,649
Alice!

418
00:29:44,086 --> 00:29:45,435
Get away!

419
00:29:45,435 --> 00:29:47,263
Get away!

420
00:30:09,764 --> 00:30:11,722
...I’d come home from school,
and I’d cry...

421
00:30:11,722 --> 00:30:14,073
lunch time,

422
00:30:14,073 --> 00:30:15,596
because I didn’t want
to go back,

423
00:30:15,596 --> 00:30:17,816
and my mother
would wipe away my tears.

424
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,296
I’d say, "Mom, do I look
like I’ve been crying?"

425
00:30:20,296 --> 00:30:23,038
She’d say,
"No, no, not at all."

426
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:24,823
I’d go outside
and meet Tipton on the sidewalk,

427
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,563
and he’d go,
"Matt, are you all right?

428
00:30:26,563 --> 00:30:28,000
Look like you've been crying."

429
00:30:29,392 --> 00:30:30,829
Every day.

430
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,743
You poor thing.

431
00:30:32,743 --> 00:30:34,093
When was that?

432
00:30:34,093 --> 00:30:39,054
Uh, I guess I was
a sophomore in college.

433
00:30:39,054 --> 00:30:41,665
I was in
the third grade.

434
00:30:41,665 --> 00:30:43,667
Careful.

435
00:30:48,542 --> 00:30:51,066
What’s this for?

436
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:09,998
Thank you.

437
00:31:15,961 --> 00:31:18,311
You ever wonder
who designs these things?

438
00:31:18,311 --> 00:31:20,182
No.

439
00:31:20,182 --> 00:31:22,141
My parents used to bring
me and my brother here

440
00:31:22,141 --> 00:31:23,620
all the time
when we were little.

441
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,926
Yeah?

442
00:31:24,926 --> 00:31:26,319
I used to ask my dad

443
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:28,147
where these
rides came from.

444
00:31:28,147 --> 00:31:30,453
How they got here.

445
00:31:30,453 --> 00:31:32,891
I don’t know
who does that.

446
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,849
He didn’t either.

447
00:31:36,242 --> 00:31:37,678
I should show you

448
00:31:37,678 --> 00:31:39,027
some of my
designs sometime.

449
00:31:39,027 --> 00:31:40,507
Some of the things
I’ve built.

450
00:31:40,507 --> 00:31:41,769
I wish you would.

451
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:43,379
My favorite
one, though,

452
00:31:43,379 --> 00:31:45,164
is this three-dimensional
board game I designed.

453
00:31:45,164 --> 00:31:47,035
It’s pretty good.Is that right?

454
00:31:47,035 --> 00:31:48,297
Yeah.

455
00:31:48,297 --> 00:31:50,082
I could never do
anything like that,

456
00:31:50,082 --> 00:31:51,648
I guess.

457
00:31:51,648 --> 00:31:52,867
Although,
you know,

458
00:31:52,867 --> 00:31:56,653
I’m good
in arithmetic.

459
00:31:56,653 --> 00:31:58,394
How old are you?Twenty.

460
00:31:58,394 --> 00:32:00,222
Really?

461
00:32:00,222 --> 00:32:01,920
Mm-hmm.

462
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,052
There is something
I ought to tell you, though.

463
00:32:04,052 --> 00:32:05,619
Okay.

464
00:32:05,619 --> 00:32:07,664
Um...

465
00:32:07,664 --> 00:32:10,276
it’s just that I never graduated
from high school.

466
00:32:10,276 --> 00:32:13,409
What?

467
00:32:13,409 --> 00:32:16,847
I said I never graduated
from high school.

468
00:32:16,847 --> 00:32:19,067
I suspected that.

469
00:32:19,067 --> 00:32:20,329
You did?

470
00:32:20,329 --> 00:32:21,591
Uh-huh.

471
00:32:21,591 --> 00:32:22,941
You see,
we were all the time

472
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,681
moving around
from place to place,

473
00:32:24,681 --> 00:32:26,770
and finally I quit getting
re-signed up and everything.

474
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,424
You know, I almost did,
but then I didn’t.

475
00:32:28,424 --> 00:32:30,296
You will one of these days.Oh, I know I will.

476
00:32:30,296 --> 00:32:33,603
I mean, it is important
that you do,

477
00:32:33,603 --> 00:32:34,953
but, you know, no rush.

478
00:32:40,523 --> 00:32:42,395
Oh, I can’t see you tonight.Why not?

479
00:32:42,395 --> 00:32:44,136
Well, I got to go to Lexington
with my mother

480
00:32:44,136 --> 00:32:45,528
to see my grandmother.
She’s sick.

481
00:32:45,528 --> 00:32:47,704
What?

482
00:32:47,704 --> 00:32:52,666
Oh, it just sounds...peculiar.

483
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:54,624
Why?

484
00:32:54,624 --> 00:32:58,150
Everybody always uses
their grandmother as an excuse.

485
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:01,370
Oh, I didn’t know that.

486
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,807
Oh, yeah. I know guys,
six, seven dead grandmothers

487
00:33:03,807 --> 00:33:06,506
all over the country.

488
00:33:25,873 --> 00:33:27,092
What’s up?
What? Hold it.

489
00:33:28,876 --> 00:33:30,138
What are you doing?

490
00:33:30,138 --> 00:33:31,835
Um, you hungry?

491
00:33:34,142 --> 00:33:35,926
I guess so.All right, park it.

492
00:33:38,581 --> 00:33:40,105
It’s just, all
I’m saying is,

493
00:33:40,105 --> 00:33:41,367
that certain
people just...

494
00:33:41,367 --> 00:33:44,022
I mean, treachery
and lies and...

495
00:33:46,372 --> 00:33:47,590
You know?

496
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,983
For example,

497
00:33:48,983 --> 00:33:50,680
I now have something
to tell you about Jewel,

498
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,508
and I really think
you’d better believe it, pal.

499
00:33:52,508 --> 00:33:53,770
I’m not going to talk
about Jewel.

500
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,381
Larkin, look,

501
00:33:55,381 --> 00:33:57,122
if Jewel is such
a touchy thing with you,

502
00:33:57,122 --> 00:33:58,427
maybe you should
think about that.

503
00:33:58,427 --> 00:33:59,776
Every time you talk about Jewel,

504
00:33:59,776 --> 00:34:01,865
you make it clear
you lust for her.

505
00:34:01,865 --> 00:34:04,216
Oh, hey.Hey.

506
00:34:04,216 --> 00:34:06,696
No. No, just hang a minute,
all right?

507
00:34:06,696 --> 00:34:07,958
Jewel is married.

508
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:10,222
What?

509
00:34:10,222 --> 00:34:11,832
Yes, she’s married.

510
00:34:11,832 --> 00:34:14,356
Jewel’s married.
She’s a married woman?

511
00:34:14,356 --> 00:34:17,316
Yeah. Well, huh...

512
00:34:17,316 --> 00:34:18,969
that’s the other thing.

513
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:21,407
What?

514
00:34:21,407 --> 00:34:22,799
She’s not a woman.

515
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:27,456
I mean, she’s not...
She’s not 20.

516
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:29,110
She’s 16 years old.
She’s a girl.

517
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,677
She is 20 years old.

518
00:34:30,677 --> 00:34:32,679
No, she’s 16 years old,
and she’s married.

519
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,420
Who told you that?

520
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,986
Are you still hungry?Who told you that?

521
00:34:35,986 --> 00:34:38,424
Uh, Sproles.
Excuse me, miss? Hi.

522
00:34:38,424 --> 00:34:40,165
Can we get some more
sliders and spikes to go?

523
00:34:40,165 --> 00:34:42,080
Sure.Thank you.

524
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,908
She’s very cute.

525
00:34:44,908 --> 00:34:46,780
Look, if
she’s married,

526
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,042
where’s
her husband?

527
00:34:48,042 --> 00:34:49,261
Because I see her
every night.

528
00:34:49,261 --> 00:34:50,523
Every night?

529
00:34:50,523 --> 00:34:52,568
Almost.

530
00:34:52,568 --> 00:34:54,744
Uh, apparently, he used to be
in the Navy. Maybe...

531
00:34:54,744 --> 00:34:56,311
He’s in the Navy?

532
00:34:56,311 --> 00:34:57,878
All right, I don’t know. Okay?

533
00:34:57,878 --> 00:34:59,793
But would you just, like,
maybe consider listening

534
00:34:59,793 --> 00:35:02,056
to somebody
besides Jewel sometime?

535
00:35:02,056 --> 00:35:03,840
Who? Sproles?

536
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,103
I don’t think so.

537
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,843
Just consider
the possibility

538
00:35:06,843 --> 00:35:10,412
that you're being lead
down some little path here.

539
00:35:13,372 --> 00:35:15,025
Whether it’s true or not,
it doesn't matter,

540
00:35:15,025 --> 00:35:16,288
because I’m crazy about her.

541
00:35:17,767 --> 00:35:19,029
You’re not crazy about her.

542
00:35:19,029 --> 00:35:20,422
I am.

543
00:35:20,422 --> 00:35:22,076
No, you think
you are.

544
00:35:22,076 --> 00:35:23,991
You tell me the difference.

545
00:35:37,483 --> 00:35:39,833
It’d be nice to see you
around campus again.

546
00:35:57,198 --> 00:36:01,811
Okay, you got king, queen,
king, queen, boy, girl...

547
00:36:01,811 --> 00:36:03,073
God...

548
00:36:03,073 --> 00:36:04,771
What does it mean?

549
00:36:04,771 --> 00:36:06,990
I don’t know
if I know yet.

550
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,775
I mean, this is
your future, here.

551
00:36:08,775 --> 00:36:10,820
This is a very
sexy deck.

552
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,170
Okay, let me
start with you.

553
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,519
You’re the nine of clubs
right here.

554
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:16,696
Uh-huh.And the five of clubs is...

555
00:36:16,696 --> 00:36:18,698
Hi, there.

556
00:36:18,698 --> 00:36:19,829
Morning, Matt.

557
00:36:28,751 --> 00:36:31,101
I’ll tell you what
they mean later, okay?

558
00:36:31,101 --> 00:36:32,494
Excuse me.

559
00:36:45,638 --> 00:36:47,553
You know what we’re
going to talk about?

560
00:36:47,553 --> 00:36:51,165
No, what?

561
00:36:51,165 --> 00:36:52,471
How come you're
such good friends

562
00:36:52,471 --> 00:36:54,168
with Laurel?

563
00:36:54,168 --> 00:36:56,649
Well, she’s Jean’s
daughter.

564
00:36:56,649 --> 00:37:01,088
She’s...15 years old?

565
00:37:01,088 --> 00:37:02,307
You think I
could be friends

566
00:37:02,307 --> 00:37:05,701
with someone
15 or 16?

567
00:37:05,701 --> 00:37:07,137
Look, let’s just not
talk about people

568
00:37:07,137 --> 00:37:09,052
in their own
home, okay?

569
00:37:16,495 --> 00:37:18,192
Is there something
bugging you about me?

570
00:37:18,192 --> 00:37:20,586
I don’t know, maybe.

571
00:37:20,586 --> 00:37:22,065
Can I see your
driver’s license?

572
00:37:22,065 --> 00:37:23,328
No, I lost
my driver’s license.

573
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:25,025
Where? At your
grandma’s?

574
00:37:25,025 --> 00:37:27,157
No. Somebody bumped into me...
Me driving my Mama’s car...

575
00:37:27,157 --> 00:37:28,507
And of course
everybody blamed me,

576
00:37:28,507 --> 00:37:29,856
and Mama just
took my license away.

577
00:37:29,856 --> 00:37:32,119
How old are you?

578
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:33,773
How old are you?

579
00:37:33,773 --> 00:37:35,035
I’m not 16 years old

580
00:37:35,035 --> 00:37:36,428
if that’s
what you heard.

581
00:37:36,428 --> 00:37:37,690
What?

582
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:39,082
What else
do you want to know?

583
00:37:39,082 --> 00:37:40,475
I want to know
if you're married.

584
00:37:40,475 --> 00:37:41,694
You don’t think
I’m smart enough

585
00:37:41,694 --> 00:37:43,173
to be going out with,
do you?

586
00:37:43,173 --> 00:37:44,740
No, just smart enough
for you,

587
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,873
because that crack you just
made about my high school.

588
00:37:46,873 --> 00:37:48,266
Will you stop
evading me?

589
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,876
You only want to
believe other people.

590
00:37:49,876 --> 00:37:51,399
You make me
believe you!

591
00:37:51,399 --> 00:37:52,922
You want to know
if I’m married?
Yeah.

592
00:37:52,922 --> 00:37:54,576
Yes!

593
00:37:54,576 --> 00:37:55,882
I’m married, okay?
I married a guy!

594
00:37:55,882 --> 00:37:57,013
Now you know!

595
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,019
I’m sorry.
I was desperate.

596
00:38:03,019 --> 00:38:05,065
I was afraid you wouldn’t
have nothing to do with me

597
00:38:05,065 --> 00:38:06,371
if you knew I was married.

598
00:38:06,371 --> 00:38:08,024
Is that what you thought?Yes.

599
00:38:08,024 --> 00:38:09,287
Good thinking.

600
00:38:13,029 --> 00:38:16,555
The marriage don’t hardly exist.
I never had sex with him.

601
00:38:16,555 --> 00:38:19,166
You never had sex with him?
Am I supposed to believe that?

602
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:20,559
You’ve got to
believe that.

603
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:22,387
I was too scared.

604
00:38:22,387 --> 00:38:23,997
I hate Green. I hate the guy.

605
00:38:23,997 --> 00:38:25,390
Thing is,
you married him.

606
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,956
But that was just
to get out of my house,

607
00:38:26,956 --> 00:38:28,828
away from that stepfather
my mama married.

608
00:38:28,828 --> 00:38:31,004
How did I know that we’d move in
with Green’s father,

609
00:38:31,004 --> 00:38:34,312
and he’d turn out
to be the same way?

610
00:38:36,836 --> 00:38:38,664
What are we supposed
to do with each other

611
00:38:38,664 --> 00:38:41,057
with you married?

612
00:39:15,962 --> 00:39:17,703
Why don’t you
come in with me?

613
00:39:17,703 --> 00:39:20,532
No, please
let me wait here.

614
00:40:12,888 --> 00:40:15,064
Good evening.
What?

615
00:40:15,064 --> 00:40:17,327
Christ, Larkin!

616
00:40:17,327 --> 00:40:18,764
It’s just you know,

617
00:40:18,764 --> 00:40:21,070
would it be too much to ask if...
You know, huh?

618
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:23,029
I had no idea
you were so rude.

619
00:40:23,029 --> 00:40:24,334
You didn’t?

620
00:40:24,334 --> 00:40:25,640
No.

621
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:30,515
Just, you know, walk in,
why don’t you, huh?

622
00:40:33,474 --> 00:40:35,171
You’ve a cousin
who’s a lawyer,

623
00:40:35,171 --> 00:40:37,347
don’t you?

624
00:40:37,347 --> 00:40:39,175
Yeah, Gary. Why?

625
00:40:39,175 --> 00:40:42,657
I need a lawyer.

626
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:47,053
For what?

627
00:40:47,053 --> 00:40:48,446
An annulment.

628
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,056
An annulment?

629
00:40:50,056 --> 00:40:51,971
What are you, nuts?

630
00:40:51,971 --> 00:40:53,755
Will you take
me to him?

631
00:40:53,755 --> 00:40:55,757
Larkin, why don’t you just
sleep on this, all right?

632
00:40:55,757 --> 00:40:57,585
In the morning
if you still want to do it...

633
00:40:57,585 --> 00:40:58,760
Screw the morning.
Tonight.

634
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,590
It’s 11:00.

635
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,463
Are you going to help me or not?

636
00:41:14,689 --> 00:41:16,386
You know, Maureen,

637
00:41:16,386 --> 00:41:18,040
you don’t have to
change the bedding.

638
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,086
I have to change the bedding,
thank you.

639
00:41:24,656 --> 00:41:26,484
Maureen’s the cleanest person
I’ve ever seen.

640
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,573
The Mayo Clinic’s
not that clean.

641
00:41:28,573 --> 00:41:29,704
She is immaculate.

642
00:41:32,446 --> 00:41:33,926
She smokes a lot
of cigarettes,

643
00:41:33,926 --> 00:41:35,231
doesn't she?

644
00:41:35,231 --> 00:41:36,537
You’d never know it.

645
00:41:36,537 --> 00:41:37,799
I swear to God,

646
00:41:37,799 --> 00:41:39,235
you could not
in any way tell.

647
00:41:39,235 --> 00:41:40,628
Not even while
she’s smoking.

648
00:41:40,628 --> 00:41:43,501
How does she do that?

649
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,763
She has an ashtray
beside her,

650
00:41:44,763 --> 00:41:46,242
and she flicks
the ash.

651
00:41:46,242 --> 00:41:47,896
The next second
you look,

652
00:41:47,896 --> 00:41:50,290
the ashtray,
it’s perfectly clean.

653
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:51,813
She’s the most neurotic
person on earth.

654
00:41:51,813 --> 00:41:53,380
Don’t say that.

655
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,295
It’s just simple psychology.No, because you know

656
00:41:55,295 --> 00:41:57,253
who you're complaining
about, Matt?

657
00:42:00,779 --> 00:42:02,041
Who?

658
00:42:02,041 --> 00:42:03,999
Maureen.
No, you're not.

659
00:42:03,999 --> 00:42:06,306
That’s not who you're
complaining about...pal.

660
00:42:13,661 --> 00:42:16,969
Means you make the marriage
null and void.

661
00:42:16,969 --> 00:42:18,361
Yeah, I know,
I know that.

662
00:42:18,361 --> 00:42:19,754
I’m sorry.

663
00:42:19,754 --> 00:42:21,016
That’s what
we have to do.

664
00:42:21,016 --> 00:42:22,801
So you have to dig up
something.

665
00:42:22,801 --> 00:42:25,543
Maybe something he lied about
before they were married.

666
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,328
Epilepsy in the family
he didn’t tell her about.

667
00:42:28,328 --> 00:42:30,896
Some kind of
bullshit like that,

668
00:42:30,896 --> 00:42:33,594
or maybe this cat

669
00:42:33,594 --> 00:42:35,074
would simply agree
to an annulment.

670
00:42:35,074 --> 00:42:36,510
In which case,
everybody just lies,

671
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:38,164
and we get some bozo judge

672
00:42:38,164 --> 00:42:40,645
to toss the marriage
out the window.

673
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,435
She never had sex
with him.

674
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:52,482
Bingo.No, bullshit.

675
00:42:52,482 --> 00:42:54,441
It’s true.

676
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:59,751
What... What’s this girl’s
religion?

677
00:42:59,751 --> 00:43:01,579
Is she some kind of Catholic?

678
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:04,494
I got to go to the pope
with this thing?

679
00:43:06,279 --> 00:43:09,717
I don’t know.
I never asked her.

680
00:43:09,717 --> 00:43:11,763
Well, forget about it.
Who cares? Leave it to me.

681
00:43:11,763 --> 00:43:14,548
Okay, so, Gary, what’s this...

682
00:43:14,548 --> 00:43:15,854
What’s this going
to set him back?

683
00:43:15,854 --> 00:43:18,073
400 or 500 bucks.Mm-hmm.

684
00:43:20,815 --> 00:43:22,208
500 bucks?

685
00:43:22,208 --> 00:43:25,385
Hey, the initial
consultation’s free.

686
00:43:30,825 --> 00:43:33,132
Look, when the horse
underneath us drops,

687
00:43:33,132 --> 00:43:34,916
we take a fresh one.

688
00:43:34,916 --> 00:43:37,353
Look, why don’t you just take
a hike on this nag...?

689
00:43:37,353 --> 00:43:38,790
This has got nothing
to do with you!

690
00:44:00,594 --> 00:44:02,683
I’m sorry.

691
00:44:06,948 --> 00:44:09,168
What happened
in there?

692
00:44:09,168 --> 00:44:10,299
Nothing.
Forget it.

693
00:44:17,306 --> 00:44:19,004
Where are we going?

694
00:44:19,004 --> 00:44:21,006
Home.

695
00:45:02,917 --> 00:45:04,353
I wish I could meet
your parents.

696
00:45:04,353 --> 00:45:06,355
Oh, some other time.

697
00:45:10,142 --> 00:45:11,665
Come on.

698
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:55,100
It smells like you in here.

699
00:45:57,450 --> 00:45:59,060
I always imagined

700
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:02,803
what your room
would look like.

701
00:46:02,803 --> 00:46:06,633
I guess I didn’t imagine
too good.

702
00:46:16,991 --> 00:46:18,253
Who’s she?

703
00:46:18,253 --> 00:46:20,778
I gave her up for you.

704
00:46:23,824 --> 00:46:25,260
She’s pretty.

705
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:28,873
Well, that’s the way
I like them.

706
00:46:28,873 --> 00:46:30,918
What’s her name?

707
00:46:30,918 --> 00:46:32,528
Oh, let’s not get into that.Tell me.

708
00:46:32,528 --> 00:46:33,965
It doesn't matter.What’s her name?

709
00:46:33,965 --> 00:46:35,531
Jewel...What is her name?

710
00:46:35,531 --> 00:46:37,011
It doesn't matter.What is her name?

711
00:46:37,011 --> 00:46:38,534
Will you be quiet?
Alice is her name.

712
00:46:38,534 --> 00:46:40,145
What the hell’s wrong with you?Her.

713
00:46:40,145 --> 00:46:42,103
I bring you here to
show you what I’m interested in.

714
00:46:42,103 --> 00:46:43,626
What I’m thinking about.
You don’t care.

715
00:46:43,626 --> 00:46:45,280
I don’t know anything
about designing things

716
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,760
or science
or anything like that.

717
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,675
You ought to start
learning a thing or two.

718
00:46:48,675 --> 00:46:50,546
What you and I do
is thrilling,

719
00:46:50,546 --> 00:46:52,026
but it’s not
the only thrill, kiddo.

720
00:46:52,026 --> 00:46:54,594
Call me kiddo, college man.Keep your voice down...

721
00:46:54,594 --> 00:46:56,161
Why’d you bring me here
if you're ashamed?

722
00:46:56,161 --> 00:46:58,293
I’m not... What?I don’t belong

723
00:46:58,293 --> 00:47:01,470
to some sorority girls club.Shh! What?

724
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:03,342
I don’t want to be here any more
than you want me.

725
00:47:03,342 --> 00:47:05,213
Why’d you bring me here?I want you here.

726
00:47:05,213 --> 00:47:06,911
Why don’t you bring me
in the daytime,

727
00:47:06,911 --> 00:47:09,000
instead in the middle of the
night like somebody’s whore!

728
00:48:45,313 --> 00:48:47,707
Hey, how come you don’t never
wear that thing?

729
00:48:47,707 --> 00:48:49,274
What?

730
00:48:49,274 --> 00:48:50,753
That.

731
00:48:50,753 --> 00:48:52,451
No reason.
No?

732
00:48:52,451 --> 00:48:53,626
No.

733
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,110
Well, when I was little,

734
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:02,809
I was so skinny,
my wrist would...

735
00:49:02,809 --> 00:49:05,377
Was so tiny, I couldn’t get
a wristband around it,

736
00:49:05,377 --> 00:49:08,032
or if there
was a band,

737
00:49:08,032 --> 00:49:10,773
the watch would
hang over both...

738
00:49:10,773 --> 00:49:12,862
Both sides
of my wrist.

739
00:49:16,127 --> 00:49:18,129
Don’t tell anybody
I told you that, okay?

740
00:49:18,129 --> 00:49:21,175
I won’t.

741
00:49:21,175 --> 00:49:22,829
Just never got used
to wearing one.

742
00:49:22,829 --> 00:49:24,309
Tell me more things like that.

743
00:49:24,309 --> 00:49:25,701
Tell me everything about you.

744
00:49:28,095 --> 00:49:30,445
No.

745
00:49:37,887 --> 00:49:39,367
Do you want to go
to Jean’s house?

746
00:49:39,367 --> 00:49:40,673
No.

747
00:49:40,673 --> 00:49:42,196
You spend too much
time over there.

748
00:49:44,546 --> 00:49:45,983
Most times I’m over there

749
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,985
waiting for you
to come out there to see me.

750
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:51,945
Those people
that hang out there, her crowd,

751
00:49:51,945 --> 00:49:53,860
they could be anybody.

752
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:55,557
You be real
jealous, okay?

753
00:49:55,557 --> 00:49:57,559
Who said anything
about being jealous?

754
00:49:57,559 --> 00:49:59,909
Jealousy is
a base emotion.

755
00:49:59,909 --> 00:50:01,650
The what?

756
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:07,004
It’s contemptible.
It’s...

757
00:50:10,442 --> 00:50:12,748
It’s bad.

758
00:50:19,233 --> 00:50:22,671
Well, I’m the jealous type
myself.

759
00:50:22,671 --> 00:50:26,066
Well...it’s base.

760
00:50:27,981 --> 00:50:29,330
Okay.

761
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:30,940
We don’t have to go
over there then.

762
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:32,420
I don’t mean to say
that you can’t go...

763
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:33,552
I said, okay!

764
00:50:52,919 --> 00:50:54,747
He still giving you a hard time?

765
00:50:54,747 --> 00:50:56,314
Who?

766
00:50:59,752 --> 00:51:01,580
Who? Your stepfather.

767
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:03,930
Oh, no.

768
00:51:07,194 --> 00:51:08,587
You’d tell me
if he was,

769
00:51:08,587 --> 00:51:10,154
wouldn’t you?

770
00:51:10,154 --> 00:51:12,199
Yeah.

771
00:51:12,199 --> 00:51:14,897
You sure?

772
00:51:14,897 --> 00:51:16,334
Yeah.

773
00:51:18,814 --> 00:51:20,468
Good.

774
00:52:02,597 --> 00:52:04,033
Give me a coffee.

775
00:52:17,743 --> 00:52:19,440
Here you go, sugar.

776
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,227
And listen, anybody can go
to some off-campus bar...

777
00:52:27,448 --> 00:52:29,842
maybe a fancy restaurant...

778
00:52:29,842 --> 00:52:31,539
You drop $22.95

779
00:52:31,539 --> 00:52:33,019
on a blackened steak
and asparagus.

780
00:52:33,019 --> 00:52:34,238
Hey, O.W.,
how you doing?

781
00:52:34,238 --> 00:52:36,327
Hey, good.
How are you?

782
00:52:36,327 --> 00:52:39,678
Naw. Naw, I like a place that’s
a little different, you know?

783
00:52:39,678 --> 00:52:41,593
I’d rather bring
a six-pack of beer over here,

784
00:52:41,593 --> 00:52:44,857
maybe a sack of White Castles
and put my feet up, you know?

785
00:52:48,034 --> 00:52:49,905
Oh, baby, don’t you have
some school work?

786
00:52:49,905 --> 00:52:51,124
No.

787
00:52:52,995 --> 00:52:54,693
Well, pretend like you do, baby.

788
00:53:05,878 --> 00:53:07,967
Hey, Matt, water hot enough?Oh, yeah, fine.

789
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:09,664
Tough living without
a bathroom, isn’t it?

790
00:53:09,664 --> 00:53:11,362
Yeah, you never get
used to it, I guess.

791
00:53:11,362 --> 00:53:13,451
Oh, and Jewel went
over to her mama’s.

792
00:53:13,451 --> 00:53:14,756
She’ll be back in an hour.

793
00:53:14,756 --> 00:53:16,323
All right.

794
00:53:21,328 --> 00:53:22,547
It’s my bet.

795
00:53:23,765 --> 00:53:25,637
I’ll bet five.

796
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:32,209
Hey, you don’t need
any money, do you?

797
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,384
Matter of fact,
I do.

798
00:53:35,777 --> 00:53:37,257
I can give you
about 50 bucks

799
00:53:37,257 --> 00:53:38,780
for that little redheaded
number of yours.

800
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,348
Hey, don’t walk away from me...

801
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:51,750
Yeah, it’s tough living here
too, boy!

802
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:53,273
Come here, faggot.

803
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,933
Roy!

804
00:54:00,933 --> 00:54:02,151
Roy, what are you doing?

805
00:54:02,151 --> 00:54:04,458
This is it, Roy!

806
00:54:04,458 --> 00:54:06,634
I never want to see
your face again.

807
00:54:06,634 --> 00:54:08,723
And take your drummer boy
with you.

808
00:54:08,723 --> 00:54:11,378
What this now, you want me
to leave here for good?

809
00:54:11,378 --> 00:54:12,640
That’s exactly right.

810
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,512
It almost sounds
like she means it.

811
00:54:14,512 --> 00:54:16,557
Yeah,
it almost does.

812
00:54:16,557 --> 00:54:18,255
You damn right, I mean it.

813
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,866
Now, get the hell out of here,
both of you.

814
00:54:26,175 --> 00:54:30,745
This guy goes to a...
A used car lot,

815
00:54:30,745 --> 00:54:33,313
and he sees a salesman,

816
00:54:33,313 --> 00:54:34,749
and he goes over
to the salesman

817
00:54:34,749 --> 00:54:37,535
and the salesman says,
"Can I help you, sir?"

818
00:54:37,535 --> 00:54:40,015
The guy says, "Yeah,
I’m looking for a new car."

819
00:54:40,015 --> 00:54:42,540
The salesman looks,
and he says, uh,

820
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:44,846
"Is that your wife
sitting there in the car?

821
00:54:44,846 --> 00:54:46,021
Looks pretty good to me."

822
00:54:53,594 --> 00:54:54,813
Hi, there.

823
00:54:54,813 --> 00:54:56,554
Hi.

824
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:04,213
You look awful lonesome
sitting there.

825
00:55:14,223 --> 00:55:16,574
They fought over me.

826
00:55:16,574 --> 00:55:18,924
I know they did.

827
00:55:27,062 --> 00:55:30,414
Me and Matt...

828
00:55:30,414 --> 00:55:32,416
You ever had an experience
like this?

829
00:55:35,201 --> 00:55:36,637
No.

830
00:55:38,683 --> 00:55:40,815
I wish I could have had
an experience like that.

831
00:55:42,948 --> 00:55:44,123
Just one.

832
00:55:46,691 --> 00:55:48,475
You’ve had lots
of experiences, Jean.

833
00:55:48,475 --> 00:55:50,042
Yeah...

834
00:55:50,042 --> 00:55:53,959
and I wish I could forget
every one of them.

835
00:56:27,035 --> 00:56:29,777
I left some water for you
on the window sill.

836
00:56:29,777 --> 00:56:31,649
Thank you.

837
00:56:34,608 --> 00:56:35,914
Jean?

838
00:56:35,914 --> 00:56:38,438
Uh-huh.

839
00:56:38,438 --> 00:56:39,570
Why didn’t you warn me?

840
00:56:41,659 --> 00:56:42,921
Honey,
I had no idea

841
00:56:42,921 --> 00:56:44,488
he was going to do
anything like that...

842
00:56:44,488 --> 00:56:47,360
No, about her.

843
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,841
Why didn’t you warn me
about her?

844
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,066
Get some sleep now.

845
00:57:15,606 --> 00:57:16,868
Say...

846
00:57:16,868 --> 00:57:20,045
Say.

847
00:57:30,925 --> 00:57:33,667
Matt, you
remember Sproles.

848
00:57:33,667 --> 00:57:34,929
Sproles...

849
00:57:34,929 --> 00:57:36,061
How goes it?

850
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:41,022
Larkin, I got
to tell you something.

851
00:57:41,022 --> 00:57:42,241
Uh, pardon me.

852
00:57:42,241 --> 00:57:43,721
This is my friend, Jane.

853
00:57:43,721 --> 00:57:45,244
She’s in
my criminal law class.

854
00:57:45,244 --> 00:57:46,985
Hi, Jane. How are you?
You got to hear this.

855
00:57:46,985 --> 00:57:48,116
Go ahead.

856
00:57:51,206 --> 00:57:55,689
Sproles knows this guy,
um, what’s his name?

857
00:57:55,689 --> 00:57:57,038
Green.

858
00:57:57,038 --> 00:57:58,344
Right,
this guy, Green,

859
00:57:58,344 --> 00:58:02,043
and-and-and he knows
his wife, Jewel.

860
00:58:02,043 --> 00:58:04,524
So...

861
00:58:04,524 --> 00:58:05,830
Uh, allow me.

862
00:58:07,266 --> 00:58:08,528
First of all,

863
00:58:08,528 --> 00:58:10,748
Green is scum,
okay?

864
00:58:10,748 --> 00:58:16,536
Now, he’s the kind of scum,
he’s, uh, 10, 12 years old,

865
00:58:16,536 --> 00:58:18,277
he tells his friends
to steal money

866
00:58:18,277 --> 00:58:20,235
from their mother’s pocketbooks

867
00:58:20,235 --> 00:58:22,324
and then when his mother’s
getting dressed,

868
00:58:22,324 --> 00:58:24,501
he charges his friends
outside her window to watch.

869
00:58:26,241 --> 00:58:27,721
So what?

870
00:58:27,721 --> 00:58:29,157
It’s got nothing to do
with Jewel.

871
00:58:29,157 --> 00:58:31,638
But this is the guy
she had to have so bad

872
00:58:31,638 --> 00:58:33,466
she married him.

873
00:58:33,466 --> 00:58:35,337
This Green character,

874
00:58:35,337 --> 00:58:36,687
my brother says
he may have murdered

875
00:58:36,687 --> 00:58:38,123
two different people.

876
00:58:38,123 --> 00:58:39,690
Sproles' brother’s
undercover.

877
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:41,169
You said.

878
00:58:41,169 --> 00:58:42,823
Listen to him,
please.

879
00:58:42,823 --> 00:58:44,608
He’s a fifth-year
senior.

880
00:58:44,608 --> 00:58:46,784
Now, Jewel,
well...

881
00:58:46,784 --> 00:58:49,700
Jewel is just a...

882
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:51,702
Look, without that body
built the way she is,

883
00:58:51,702 --> 00:58:53,573
nobody would go near her,
and she’s what?

884
00:58:53,573 --> 00:58:55,967
She’s 16 years old?That’s not true.

885
00:58:55,967 --> 00:58:57,838
Yeah, right.

886
00:58:57,838 --> 00:59:00,493
Do you realize
I know all about you?

887
00:59:00,493 --> 00:59:02,321
How you met her over at Jean’s.

888
00:59:02,321 --> 00:59:03,670
Your little love-hutch.

889
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:06,064
I even know
about the night

890
00:59:06,064 --> 00:59:07,979
at the side
of the house.

891
00:59:12,766 --> 00:59:14,246
I don’t know how you

892
00:59:14,246 --> 00:59:16,030
or anybody else
would know about that.

893
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:17,423
How could I know?

894
00:59:17,423 --> 00:59:19,817
Ask yourself.

895
00:59:19,817 --> 00:59:21,732
Jewel told you?

896
00:59:21,732 --> 00:59:23,777
No, that, uh, what’s her name?
Um, Laurel.

897
00:59:23,777 --> 00:59:25,387
She told me.

898
00:59:25,387 --> 00:59:28,913
Look, she’s like, uh,
what’s that word?

899
00:59:30,697 --> 00:59:33,134
Manipulating you,
like, uh...

900
00:59:33,134 --> 00:59:34,309
Putty.

901
00:59:36,311 --> 00:59:38,879
Yeah.

902
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:40,925
Listen, you don’t have to marry
every teenage girl

903
00:59:40,925 --> 00:59:42,927
that catches your eye.

904
00:59:42,927 --> 00:59:45,277
Especially if she’s already
married to somebody else...

905
00:59:45,277 --> 00:59:46,800
Who said anything
about marrying her?

906
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:50,151
Okay, I told Sproles
you might.

907
00:59:50,151 --> 00:59:51,762
She sees a chance
in you, that’s all.

908
00:59:51,762 --> 00:59:52,937
You got breeding.

909
00:59:54,286 --> 00:59:56,201
I don’t have breeding.I know.

910
00:59:56,201 --> 00:59:58,595
But compared to her you do.

911
01:00:01,685 --> 01:00:06,124
This is a girl
who lies to you, Larkin.

912
01:00:18,919 --> 01:00:20,617
Thank you.

913
01:00:27,798 --> 01:00:29,147
Your friend is, uh...Just shut up.

914
01:01:44,962 --> 01:01:48,705
Oh, I missed a class.

915
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,271
Tell me about it.

916
01:01:50,271 --> 01:01:52,796
No, I hate missing
General Health.

917
01:01:52,796 --> 01:01:54,493
General Health?

918
01:01:54,493 --> 01:01:56,451
What the hell are you doing
taking General Health?

919
01:01:56,451 --> 01:01:58,802
I didn’t take it when I was a
freshman, when it was required.

920
01:01:58,802 --> 01:02:00,891
Now, I take it,
or I don’t graduate.

921
01:02:00,891 --> 01:02:03,502
That’s humiliating, huh?

922
01:02:03,502 --> 01:02:05,112
Well, actually,

923
01:02:05,112 --> 01:02:06,505
the good thing
is the girls.

924
01:02:09,943 --> 01:02:11,423
You’re surrounded
by all these,

925
01:02:11,423 --> 01:02:14,905
well, smart, healthy,
frisky, freshmen animals.

926
01:02:16,602 --> 01:02:19,518
They idolize you,
you know?

927
01:02:19,518 --> 01:02:20,867
It’s like being
in a corral

928
01:02:20,867 --> 01:02:23,217
with these wild ponies.

929
01:02:23,217 --> 01:02:25,742
It sounds good.

930
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:28,832
Yeah, it is good.

931
01:02:36,274 --> 01:02:38,972
Leta’s go out.

932
01:02:38,972 --> 01:02:40,234
Where?

933
01:02:40,234 --> 01:02:42,106
Follow me.

934
01:02:42,106 --> 01:02:44,021
What, girls?

935
01:02:44,021 --> 01:02:45,457
What do you think?

936
01:02:45,457 --> 01:02:47,720
I think
I like your style, Larkin.

937
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:48,982
Because you know,

938
01:02:48,982 --> 01:02:50,244
I’m not going to
wake up someday

939
01:02:50,244 --> 01:02:51,593
saddled to
some mistake,

940
01:02:51,593 --> 01:02:52,856
and you're
not either.

941
01:02:56,207 --> 01:02:58,470
You know what I don’t get?

942
01:02:58,470 --> 01:03:01,255
How your dad made
so much money so fast.

943
01:03:01,255 --> 01:03:04,041
It wasn’t so fast.

944
01:03:04,041 --> 01:03:07,044
Look, I think about this country and economics

945
01:03:07,044 --> 01:03:08,654
and having a little bit of self-go-get-'em,

946
01:03:08,654 --> 01:03:10,134
and I can’t understand

947
01:03:10,134 --> 01:03:12,527
why everyone, say,
over the age of 32,

948
01:03:12,527 --> 01:03:14,355
isn’t incredibly wealthy.In the first place,

949
01:03:14,355 --> 01:03:17,315
everybody doesn't want
to be incredibly wealthy.

950
01:03:17,315 --> 01:03:18,533
Okay, bobo.

951
01:03:18,533 --> 01:03:20,057
Say!

952
01:03:20,057 --> 01:03:21,449
Say...

953
01:03:21,449 --> 01:03:22,929
Hey...

954
01:03:22,929 --> 01:03:25,889
We were going to call,
but we didn’t.

955
01:03:25,889 --> 01:03:27,020
No problem.

956
01:03:30,284 --> 01:03:31,459
Who beat you up?

957
01:03:33,331 --> 01:03:34,723
Some asshole.

958
01:03:37,944 --> 01:03:42,383
So...anybody
want to, uh...

959
01:03:42,383 --> 01:03:43,689

Yeah.

1008
01:05:54,037 --> 01:05:55,908
Saint something.

1009
01:05:55,908 --> 01:05:59,825
I don’t know.

1010
01:05:59,825 --> 01:06:03,220
I’m glad
you kissed off Alice.

1011
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:05,439
I knew you would.

1012
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:08,181
You did?

1013
01:06:08,181 --> 01:06:10,923
I had a hunch.

1014
01:06:10,923 --> 01:06:13,970
Because a few
months ago,

1015
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:17,974
about the time
of your engagement,

1016
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:21,586
I began to see
things more clearly.

1017
01:06:21,586 --> 01:06:22,848
I began to wake up

1018
01:06:22,848 --> 01:06:24,937
to the things
around me.

1019
01:06:24,937 --> 01:06:26,808
Wake up?

1020
01:06:29,855 --> 01:06:31,378
See...

1021
01:06:34,164 --> 01:06:36,688
someone can
be asleep...

1022
01:06:38,777 --> 01:06:40,953
like, unconscious,

1023
01:06:40,953 --> 01:06:42,259
until much older

1024
01:06:42,259 --> 01:06:44,000
than you’d think
possible.

1025
01:06:47,264 --> 01:06:49,092
You can do things.

1026
01:06:50,658 --> 01:06:52,573
People talk to you,
you talk to them,

1027
01:06:52,573 --> 01:06:54,401
but you're really just...

1028
01:06:54,401 --> 01:06:57,665
Talking
in your sleep.

1029
01:06:57,665 --> 01:07:00,842
Sounds like you know
what I’m talking about.

1030
01:07:00,842 --> 01:07:02,931
It does?

1031
01:07:06,848 --> 01:07:08,154
I should
tell you, Ellen,

1032
01:07:08,154 --> 01:07:10,678
I’m on
the rebound, here.

1033
01:07:12,811 --> 01:07:16,554
I don’t give a shit.

1034
01:07:29,262 --> 01:07:30,568
What’s up?

1035
01:07:30,568 --> 01:07:32,831
It’s time
for a change.

1036
01:07:45,844 --> 01:07:47,715
Have you heard this or not?No.

1037
01:07:47,715 --> 01:07:49,413
Listen, listen, all right,
here it is, okay?

1038
01:07:49,413 --> 01:07:51,502
This guy walks into
a psychiatrist’s office,

1039
01:07:51,502 --> 01:07:52,851
all right, and...

1040
01:07:52,851 --> 01:07:54,548
With a parrot
on his shoulder, okay?

1041
01:07:54,548 --> 01:07:57,029
And-and-and he says,
um, the psychiatrist says,

1042
01:07:57,029 --> 01:07:58,378
"Yes, sir, how can I help you?"

1043
01:07:58,378 --> 01:07:59,640
And the...

1044
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:01,294
The parrot says...

1045
01:08:01,294 --> 01:08:04,428
"Get this guy off my feet."

1046
01:08:04,428 --> 01:08:06,908
You’ve heard
this joke?

1047
01:08:06,908 --> 01:08:08,432
How come you guys got so many
schmellows?

1048
01:08:08,432 --> 01:08:09,955
I didn’t get it.

1049
01:08:09,955 --> 01:08:12,436
You don’t get it?Yeah, I don’t get it.

1050
01:08:12,436 --> 01:08:14,090
Why don’t you amble
over here by the fire,

1051
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,395
and I’ll
explain it to you.

1052
01:08:15,395 --> 01:08:16,875
Gross.

1053
01:08:16,875 --> 01:08:18,659
How come we dragged
ourselves out here?

1054
01:08:18,659 --> 01:08:20,270
She likes you.I guess so.

1055
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:22,837
I mean it. I’m sorry.
I do not feel dragged.

1056
01:08:22,837 --> 01:08:25,101
How did you guys know
about this place?

1057
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:27,059
This place is a dive.What are you talking about?

1058
01:08:27,059 --> 01:08:29,235
This place is great.It’s horrible.

1059
01:08:29,235 --> 01:08:30,628
Us? Huh?

1060
01:08:30,628 --> 01:08:33,152
How do we know
about this place?

1061
01:08:33,152 --> 01:08:36,590
Uh, we... We come
hunting here sometimes.

1062
01:08:36,590 --> 01:08:37,852
Come on, you guys.

1063
01:08:37,852 --> 01:08:39,202
Yes. We come hunting.

1064
01:08:39,202 --> 01:08:41,726
What do you hunt?What do you hunt?

1065
01:08:41,726 --> 01:08:43,641
We hunt with
a crossbow.

1066
01:08:43,641 --> 01:08:45,077
We hunt wild geese
and wild boar.

1067
01:08:45,077 --> 01:08:46,383
Wild boar?

1068
01:08:46,383 --> 01:08:48,646
Yeah.
Wild boar?

1069
01:08:48,646 --> 01:08:50,604
Is that... Is that
where you found Alice?

1070
01:08:50,604 --> 01:08:52,171
Ooh!

1071
01:08:52,171 --> 01:08:54,086
I bet you and Alice
come here all the time.

1072
01:08:54,086 --> 01:08:56,610
Is this your little love nest?Come on.

1073
01:08:56,610 --> 01:08:59,352
I was seeing a married woman,
and we used to come here.

1074
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:09,580
I don’t think that’s funny.

1075
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:11,016
That is so funny.
That is...

1076
01:09:11,016 --> 01:09:12,496
I mean, this guy, you
joke and you joke.

1077
01:09:12,496 --> 01:09:13,975
Mister Rebound.

1078
01:09:13,975 --> 01:09:15,499
No, I think he’s not kidding.

1079
01:09:15,499 --> 01:09:17,065
Of course he’s kidding.
What are you, bobo?

1080
01:09:17,065 --> 01:09:18,458
Come on, he’s kidding.Hey!

1081
01:09:18,458 --> 01:09:20,330
You were serious
with a married person?

1082
01:09:20,330 --> 01:09:22,332
You don’t get serious
over a married person.

1083
01:09:22,332 --> 01:09:23,811
You just... You...
You have fun with her.

1084
01:09:23,811 --> 01:09:25,248
Wait a minute.

1085
01:09:25,248 --> 01:09:27,598
Are you in a problem
with this married person

1086
01:09:27,598 --> 01:09:29,121
and we’re here to mend
your bruised heart?

1087
01:09:29,121 --> 01:09:30,470
Did you have fun with her?

1088
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:32,080
No, this is
not true.

1089
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,299
Because we’re not
like a bunch

1090
01:09:33,299 --> 01:09:34,909
of desperate old housewives

1091
01:09:34,909 --> 01:09:36,824
that just need to escape out
someplace and get laid.

1092
01:09:36,824 --> 01:09:39,044
Wait! Who said anything
about getting laid yet?

1093
01:09:39,044 --> 01:09:40,393
Uh, I...

1094
01:09:40,393 --> 01:09:42,787
You know something
guys don’t realize?

1095
01:09:44,092 --> 01:09:45,224
Move.

1096
01:09:46,573 --> 01:09:47,835
Don’t throw that at me.

1097
01:09:47,835 --> 01:09:49,097
They don’t realize

1098
01:09:49,097 --> 01:09:50,316
that we consider
ourselves lucky

1099
01:09:50,316 --> 01:09:51,665
when we get laid.

1100
01:09:51,665 --> 01:09:53,189
No, no, you see,
you're wrong there.

1101
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:55,930
We consider you very lucky
when you get laid.

1102
01:09:55,930 --> 01:09:57,497
Oh, come on,
back me up on this.

1103
01:09:57,497 --> 01:09:59,107
That is... That is really rude
and vile.

1104
01:09:59,107 --> 01:10:01,197
Now I’m trying to make
an important point,

1105
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:03,242
I believe.Yes, yes,

1106
01:10:03,242 --> 01:10:04,591
men and women
are very similar.

1107
01:10:04,591 --> 01:10:06,114
Oh, yes,
we’re so similar.

1108
01:10:06,114 --> 01:10:07,464
Yes, but
the difference is,

1109
01:10:07,464 --> 01:10:08,726
with guys...
No, with guys...

1110
01:10:08,726 --> 01:10:10,510
That’s dumb.What, sex? Oh, please.

1111
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:11,816
Look at me.

1112
01:10:11,816 --> 01:10:14,340
I like women
for their minds.

1113
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:16,081
Oh, come on,
guys.

1114
01:10:16,081 --> 01:10:17,430
And their
intelligence.

1115
01:10:17,430 --> 01:10:18,736
You loved my mind in the
pool, babe.

1116
01:10:18,736 --> 01:10:21,042
Yeah, well, not your mind.

1117
01:10:21,042 --> 01:10:23,175
Women... Women
are so special.

1118
01:10:23,175 --> 01:10:24,916
I know where your mind is.
Absolutely juvenile.

1119
01:10:24,916 --> 01:10:26,483
Juvenile?

1120
01:10:26,483 --> 01:10:28,267
You know what your problem is?

1121
01:10:34,534 --> 01:10:36,754
Who are you all?

1122
01:10:38,930 --> 01:10:40,105
Who are you?

1123
01:11:00,299 --> 01:11:02,432
I got to go meet somebody.

1124
01:11:04,477 --> 01:11:07,698
Anybody got
a cigarette?

1125
01:11:07,698 --> 01:11:10,135
Mind if I flop a minute?

1126
01:11:29,372 --> 01:11:31,939
When I was a little baby
about less than a year old,

1127
01:11:31,939 --> 01:11:35,160
people in my family used to
give me cigarettes to smoke.

1128
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:36,857
When you were
how old?

1129
01:11:36,857 --> 01:11:37,989
Just a little baby.

1130
01:11:39,599 --> 01:11:41,122
They used to hold lit
cigarettes up to me,

1131
01:11:41,122 --> 01:11:42,341
the ones they were smoking,

1132
01:11:42,341 --> 01:11:44,169
and I just draw on them

1133
01:11:44,169 --> 01:11:47,694
like they was
a bottle of milk.

1134
01:11:47,694 --> 01:11:50,218
I’ve been smoking since I was
less than a year old.

1135
01:11:50,218 --> 01:11:51,524
I’ve been addicted that long.

1136
01:11:53,744 --> 01:11:57,182
God, the things they
can find to do to you.

1137
01:11:59,750 --> 01:12:01,621
And, like, take, like,

1138
01:12:01,621 --> 01:12:04,668
there was this family on this
lookout mountain, way high up,

1139
01:12:04,668 --> 01:12:07,235
and this little girl’s momma
picks her up by under the arms

1140
01:12:07,235 --> 01:12:09,803
and makes her look
all the way down,

1141
01:12:09,803 --> 01:12:12,893
maybe two whole miles,

1142
01:12:12,893 --> 01:12:14,721
and this little girl’s
dangling over the wall,

1143
01:12:14,721 --> 01:12:16,897
screaming her lungs out,

1144
01:12:16,897 --> 01:12:19,247
and the mama’s saying,
"Look, look, little baby,

1145
01:12:19,247 --> 01:12:22,512
you can see seven states."

1146
01:12:28,996 --> 01:12:30,563
You do that to a little child,

1147
01:12:30,563 --> 01:12:32,348
and you can scar her brain
for life.

1148
01:12:43,924 --> 01:12:46,405
Crazy fucking things
happen to you.

1149
01:12:49,321 --> 01:12:51,889
Can I see you outside a minute?

1150
01:13:12,039 --> 01:13:14,085
Some kind of mess,
isn’t it?

1151
01:13:23,181 --> 01:13:24,487
You get the money?

1152
01:13:24,487 --> 01:13:26,053
Yeah, I got it.

1153
01:13:26,053 --> 01:13:28,316
Thanks.

1154
01:13:30,971 --> 01:13:32,538
Did you come out here
with these people

1155
01:13:32,538 --> 01:13:34,410
just to hurt me?

1156
01:13:37,935 --> 01:13:40,851
It worked.

1157
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:45,508
Why have you left me?

1158
01:13:47,727 --> 01:13:50,034
I haven’t.

1159
01:13:55,648 --> 01:13:57,694
I just tried to.

1160
01:14:05,092 --> 01:14:07,443
I need to borrow your car
to go meet Green.

1161
01:14:09,096 --> 01:14:10,315
You want to borrow my car...

1162
01:14:10,315 --> 01:14:11,969
Please.

1163
01:14:15,276 --> 01:14:18,279
I have to go meet him
to talk about the annulment.

1164
01:14:27,027 --> 01:14:28,159
Be careful.

1165
01:14:33,817 --> 01:14:35,949
Come back soon.

1166
01:14:38,909 --> 01:14:40,606
I will.

1167
01:14:49,049 --> 01:14:52,226
He would scare
him to death,

1168
01:14:52,226 --> 01:14:55,403
and he forgot it was...

1169
01:14:55,403 --> 01:14:57,275
Oh, he’s back.

1170
01:14:59,582 --> 01:15:01,061
Is the night ruined?

1171
01:15:01,061 --> 01:15:02,585
What does
everybody think?

1172
01:15:02,585 --> 01:15:03,847
I don’t think

1173
01:15:03,847 --> 01:15:06,632
anything has
to be ruined.

1174
01:15:06,632 --> 01:15:08,808
Can I talk to
you for a sec?

1175
01:15:13,683 --> 01:15:14,945
Jeez, man,
I don’t know,

1176
01:15:14,945 --> 01:15:16,512
maybe I ought to
kick your ass, huh?

1177
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:18,688
Huh? Huh?

1178
01:15:18,688 --> 01:15:21,212
We got these highly
attractive women out here.

1179
01:15:21,212 --> 01:15:23,954
We bring them out here, right,
and what do you do?

1180
01:15:23,954 --> 01:15:25,695
I mean, you let Jewel
come in and act up

1181
01:15:25,695 --> 01:15:27,000
right in the middle
of everything.

1182
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,349
It’s...

1183
01:15:28,349 --> 01:15:29,568
I mean, look,
look at me.

1184
01:15:29,568 --> 01:15:30,830
I’m busting my ass

1185
01:15:30,830 --> 01:15:32,179
trying to
straighten you out.

1186
01:15:32,179 --> 01:15:33,485
I don’t know
why I bother.

1187
01:15:33,485 --> 01:15:35,095
Don’t bother.

1188
01:15:35,095 --> 01:15:37,750
Yeah, I’ll tell you
why I bother.

1189
01:15:39,056 --> 01:15:42,842
Because when you
become our age, it...

1190
01:15:42,842 --> 01:15:44,278
It gets harder
and harder, you know,

1191
01:15:44,278 --> 01:15:48,152
to... To make
friends, all right...

1192
01:15:50,154 --> 01:15:51,764
and if you find someone
who you like,

1193
01:15:51,764 --> 01:15:53,026
or you have someone you like

1194
01:15:53,026 --> 01:15:55,333
for some reason...

1195
01:15:56,769 --> 01:15:58,292
I say, okay,
you fight to keep him.

1196
01:15:58,292 --> 01:16:00,947
So I will, okay?

1197
01:16:00,947 --> 01:16:04,821
But just...
come on, come on,

1198
01:16:04,821 --> 01:16:06,997
just don’t push me
to the limit on this thing.

1199
01:16:06,997 --> 01:16:10,522
This isn’t the only place
in the world.

1200
01:16:14,178 --> 01:16:16,093
Leta’s go to a spot.

1201
01:16:16,093 --> 01:16:18,356
Look, these are... These are
wonderful girls, here.

1202
01:16:21,054 --> 01:16:23,753
I can’t go.

1203
01:16:23,753 --> 01:16:29,106
Listen, I don’t want
to take sides, but...

1204
01:16:29,106 --> 01:16:31,325
I can’t go.

1205
01:16:38,898 --> 01:16:40,596
Okay. Fine.

1206
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:42,510
Come on.

1207
01:16:47,907 --> 01:16:49,561
Leta’s go.

1208
01:18:15,212 --> 01:18:19,042
Hello?

1209
01:18:19,042 --> 01:18:21,131
Jean?

1210
01:18:29,661 --> 01:18:30,923
Hey.

1211
01:18:30,923 --> 01:18:32,838
Hey.

1212
01:18:35,319 --> 01:18:38,235
She’s at her
mother’s house.

1213
01:18:38,235 --> 01:18:40,411
Thanks.

1214
01:18:40,411 --> 01:18:41,673
Matt...

1215
01:18:41,673 --> 01:18:43,414
Yeah?

1216
01:18:43,414 --> 01:18:45,851
Wish you well.

1217
01:18:45,851 --> 01:18:48,506
You too, Jean.

1218
01:19:46,390 --> 01:19:48,087
Okay, what
happened?

1219
01:19:48,087 --> 01:19:49,785
Why couldn’t you
come back last night?

1220
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:51,656
It doesn't matter.Tell me what happened, Jewel.

1221
01:19:51,656 --> 01:19:52,875
You'll hate me if I tell you.

1222
01:19:52,875 --> 01:19:54,267
I won’t hate you.

1223
01:19:56,182 --> 01:19:58,141
I can’t hate you.

1224
01:20:00,143 --> 01:20:02,623
I drove out, and I met Green
at the Blue Devil.

1225
01:20:02,623 --> 01:20:04,364
The Blue Devil?

1226
01:20:04,364 --> 01:20:06,192
That’s where he told me
to go meet him.

1227
01:20:06,192 --> 01:20:08,891
I had to if I want him
to go along with the annulment.

1228
01:20:08,891 --> 01:20:10,936
Why didn’t you tell me
you were going there?

1229
01:20:10,936 --> 01:20:12,938
I would have
gone with you.

1230
01:20:12,938 --> 01:20:14,810
You didn’t ask me.

1231
01:20:18,074 --> 01:20:19,989
I met him out in front,
where he was standing there

1232
01:20:19,989 --> 01:20:21,294
with a couple
of other guys,

1233
01:20:21,294 --> 01:20:23,906
and he come over to my car...

1234
01:20:23,906 --> 01:20:25,255
He came over.
He didn’t come over.

1235
01:20:25,255 --> 01:20:27,300
It already happened.
He came o...

1236
01:20:35,265 --> 01:20:36,396
Then what?

1237
01:20:40,357 --> 01:20:42,838
He wanted me to get
in the back seat with him,

1238
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:44,230
and I said no,

1239
01:20:44,230 --> 01:20:46,102
and I tried to start up the car
to leave,

1240
01:20:46,102 --> 01:20:47,538
but the car wouldn’t start.

1241
01:20:47,538 --> 01:20:48,931
It just wouldn’t start.I know, I know.

1242
01:20:50,410 --> 01:20:52,760
Go on.

1243
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:56,068
So then he made me
get in the backseat with him.

1244
01:20:56,068 --> 01:20:58,766
He said just to talk.

1245
01:20:58,766 --> 01:21:00,290
So I give him these papers

1246
01:21:00,290 --> 01:21:03,075
that this lawyer guy
gives for him to sign,

1247
01:21:03,075 --> 01:21:04,555
but he wouldn’t
sign it.

1248
01:21:04,555 --> 01:21:06,165
By then, a bunch
of these other guys

1249
01:21:06,165 --> 01:21:07,514
had started
gathering around,

1250
01:21:07,514 --> 01:21:10,387
and some of them
got in with us,

1251
01:21:10,387 --> 01:21:13,303
and one of them was Green’s
old man, he was there.

1252
01:21:13,303 --> 01:21:16,784
He’s even more awful
than my stepfather ever was...

1253
01:21:20,179 --> 01:21:23,313
and then they all started
grabbing me and touching me,

1254
01:21:23,313 --> 01:21:26,664
or trying to,
because I was struggling,

1255
01:21:26,664 --> 01:21:29,188
and then Green made them stop,

1256
01:21:29,188 --> 01:21:30,973
and I thought he was going
to protect me,

1257
01:21:30,973 --> 01:21:32,583
but I should have known better.

1258
01:21:32,583 --> 01:21:34,106
He told them

1259
01:21:34,106 --> 01:21:35,499
that he would
show me off

1260
01:21:35,499 --> 01:21:37,936
for money
from them.

1261
01:21:37,936 --> 01:21:39,851
So they all started
paying him.

1262
01:21:42,767 --> 01:21:44,377
And one of them
would hold me down,

1263
01:21:44,377 --> 01:21:46,379
and Green would pull up my shirt
and my bra

1264
01:21:46,379 --> 01:21:50,427
and show me off
to one or two of them,

1265
01:21:50,427 --> 01:21:52,081
and then some of them
would get out,

1266
01:21:52,081 --> 01:21:55,736
and then others would get in
and the same thing,

1267
01:21:55,736 --> 01:21:58,739
and the windows
were getting all fogged up,

1268
01:21:58,739 --> 01:22:01,481
and I was getting dizzy
and shaken and bruised,

1269
01:22:01,481 --> 01:22:03,527
and I couldn’t even struggle
anymore or think straight,

1270
01:22:03,527 --> 01:22:07,313
and every one of them
was just laughing

1271
01:22:07,313 --> 01:22:09,489
and slapping
each other around

1272
01:22:09,489 --> 01:22:10,621
and passing liquor...

1273
01:22:12,710 --> 01:22:15,756
and then I don’t remember
what happened after that.

1274
01:22:17,106 --> 01:22:18,368
Are you telling me you
were raped

1275
01:22:18,368 --> 01:22:19,673
in the back of my car?

1276
01:22:19,673 --> 01:22:21,980
I don’t know.Of course you know.

1277
01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:26,767
I said I’m only clear about it
as much as I told you.

1278
01:22:31,903 --> 01:22:34,340
How long did this go on?

1279
01:22:36,429 --> 01:22:38,823
It seemed like a very long time.

1280
01:22:41,347 --> 01:22:43,654
If you were assaulted,
we got to do something about it.

1281
01:22:43,654 --> 01:22:45,090
No.

1282
01:22:45,090 --> 01:22:47,310
I went through it,
and it’s over.

1283
01:22:47,310 --> 01:22:50,226
It’s done with,
and I want to forget about it.

1284
01:22:50,226 --> 01:22:51,879
I passed out.
I must have passed out,

1285
01:22:51,879 --> 01:22:53,185
because I woke up this morning

1286
01:22:53,185 --> 01:22:54,447
with my clothes every
which-a-way

1287
01:22:54,447 --> 01:22:55,753
and I just
straightened myself up,

1288
01:22:55,753 --> 01:22:58,451
and I come right here.

1289
01:22:58,451 --> 01:23:00,845
Did you recognize anybody
besides Green and his old man?

1290
01:23:04,109 --> 01:23:05,763
Yeah, one.

1291
01:23:05,763 --> 01:23:07,025
That friend of Tipton's
was there.

1292
01:23:07,025 --> 01:23:09,288
Who?Um...

1293
01:23:10,681 --> 01:23:12,988
Sproles.
That guy Sproles was there.

1294
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:15,555
He paid his money to see me,
I swear it.

1295
01:23:18,558 --> 01:23:21,170
Is everybody going to have
a different story, Jewel?

1296
01:23:29,874 --> 01:23:31,919
Will you let me take you
to a doctor?

1297
01:23:33,834 --> 01:23:35,575
No.

1298
01:24:06,389 --> 01:24:07,912
You... You’re sick!

1299
01:24:07,912 --> 01:24:09,479
Hey, hey, hey, Larkin!Last night.

1300
01:24:09,479 --> 01:24:12,047
No... Oh, no, no, no,
you don’t understand.

1301
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:14,440
I was there,
but I just happened to be there.

1302
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:16,877
I wasn’t...
I... I had nothing to do with it.

1303
01:24:16,877 --> 01:24:18,705
Look, I was a bystander.

1304
01:24:18,705 --> 01:24:20,664
Hey...

1305
01:24:20,664 --> 01:24:22,753
Look, Jewel parked in the front
of the drive-in, see,

1306
01:24:22,753 --> 01:24:26,322
and Green, he’s there
with a bunch of guys in...

1307
01:24:26,322 --> 01:24:29,586
Shooting craps
in the back of his truck.

1308
01:24:29,586 --> 01:24:32,284
He... He’s got
a fistful of money.

1309
01:24:32,284 --> 01:24:34,547
He comes over,
gets in the car with Jewel

1310
01:24:34,547 --> 01:24:36,332
and starts trying
to fool around with her.

1311
01:24:36,332 --> 01:24:37,594
He was showing her off.
No!

1312
01:24:37,594 --> 01:24:38,899
That’s the way she tells it.

1313
01:24:38,899 --> 01:24:40,640
She’s being exhibited.

1314
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:42,207
Well, no, maybe she
perceived it that way.

1315
01:24:42,207 --> 01:24:43,643
I don’t know.

1316
01:24:43,643 --> 01:24:45,297
See, the money Green had
in his hands,

1317
01:24:45,297 --> 01:24:47,995
maybe she perceived
it was payment to look at her.

1318
01:24:47,995 --> 01:24:50,781
Maybe that’s why
she was fighting.

1319
01:24:52,913 --> 01:24:54,132
How did you
just so happen

1320
01:24:54,132 --> 01:24:55,568
to be at
the Blue Devil, Sproles?

1321
01:24:55,568 --> 01:24:57,614
I was there with my brother.

1322
01:24:57,614 --> 01:24:59,268
He’s an undercover cop,
for chrissakes.

1323
01:24:59,268 --> 01:25:01,879
Look, he came
out front

1324
01:25:01,879 --> 01:25:03,446
to see
what was going on,

1325
01:25:03,446 --> 01:25:05,361
and he sent the guys
on their way.

1326
01:25:05,361 --> 01:25:07,102
Now, if Jewel were
being mistreated

1327
01:25:07,102 --> 01:25:09,191
back there, Larkin,
by those thugs,

1328
01:25:09,191 --> 01:25:11,193
he would’ve arrested
the whole bunch.

1329
01:25:11,193 --> 01:25:13,456
Now I’m telling you
the truth.

1330
01:25:13,456 --> 01:25:16,328
You can ask
my brother.

1331
01:25:16,328 --> 01:25:17,982
Look, I’m not saying
Jewel was lying to you.

1332
01:25:17,982 --> 01:25:19,288
She was hysterical.

1333
01:25:19,288 --> 01:25:22,639
She, uh, maybe she got panicky.

1334
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:25,120
She... What do you call it, um,

1335
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,861
misinterpreted
what was going on.

1336
01:25:36,305 --> 01:25:38,611
Do you know where Green lives?

1337
01:25:38,611 --> 01:25:39,873
Huh?

1338
01:25:39,873 --> 01:25:42,137
Yeah.

1339
01:25:42,137 --> 01:25:44,530
No, look,
I have a class.

1340
01:25:52,582 --> 01:25:53,974
My brother’s going
to get the guy

1341
01:25:53,974 --> 01:25:56,325
eventually, Matt,
for all kinds of stuff.

1342
01:25:56,325 --> 01:25:58,153
Why don’t you just
leave him

1343
01:25:58,153 --> 01:26:00,546
to my brother, hmm?

1344
01:26:04,115 --> 01:26:06,900
Look, I don’t have
to go in there, do I?

1345
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:08,685
I mean,
there’s nothing I can...

1346
01:26:08,685 --> 01:26:11,166
Take off, Sproles.

1347
01:28:50,150 --> 01:28:52,544
Well now...

1348
01:28:52,544 --> 01:28:54,024
you just came right on in,
didn’t you?

1349
01:28:55,678 --> 01:28:56,983
I knocked.

1350
01:29:01,858 --> 01:29:04,643
Well, I’m not going to worry
about it.

1351
01:29:10,519 --> 01:29:12,695
Business good?

1352
01:29:20,529 --> 01:29:22,574
Working myself
to death.

1353
01:29:44,335 --> 01:29:47,207
What is this?

1354
01:29:47,207 --> 01:29:49,079
You’re not
very good at this.

1355
01:29:49,079 --> 01:29:51,777
This supposed to be an animal?

1356
01:29:57,043 --> 01:29:59,176
Didn’t exactly
bring it to life, did you?

1357
01:30:01,526 --> 01:30:03,136
Just kind of
take a bar of Life-boy

1358
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:05,487
and hack
the thing up?

1359
01:30:05,487 --> 01:30:07,967
Maybe I ought to wash
your mouth out with it.

1360
01:30:09,186 --> 01:30:12,232
You want to do that?

1361
01:30:12,232 --> 01:30:14,278
You want to
wash my mouth out with it?

1362
01:30:26,725 --> 01:30:28,901
Why are you here?

1363
01:30:28,901 --> 01:30:30,163
I think she
likes it here.

1364
01:30:30,163 --> 01:30:31,338
I don’t think so.

1365
01:30:33,253 --> 01:30:35,342
What are you
doing here?

1366
01:30:35,342 --> 01:30:38,302
You gonna be the prince,
is that it?

1367
01:30:38,302 --> 01:30:40,609
You’re gonna carry her off
on a big white horse?

1368
01:30:42,872 --> 01:30:44,003
No.

1369
01:30:45,483 --> 01:30:47,398
I’m nobody’s prince.

1370
01:30:47,398 --> 01:30:52,185
Well, I think she’s expecting
you to give her everything.

1371
01:30:52,185 --> 01:30:54,623
Haven’t you led her to believe
that you would?

1372
01:30:56,755 --> 01:30:58,061
I can’t.

1373
01:30:58,061 --> 01:30:59,976
I can’t do that.

1374
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:02,892
So you're here
to bail out tonight.

1375
01:31:04,676 --> 01:31:06,199
Right?

1376
01:31:06,199 --> 01:31:08,637
I mean, if you ain’t gonna just
sweep her away,

1377
01:31:08,637 --> 01:31:10,029
well, you're bailing out.

1378
01:31:15,208 --> 01:31:16,601
Ain’t no in-between here, son.

1379
01:31:19,517 --> 01:31:22,346
Well, maybe there is.

1380
01:31:22,346 --> 01:31:24,609
Maybe you would
sleep a lot better, now,

1381
01:31:24,609 --> 01:31:25,915
knowing she’d been...released.

1382
01:31:27,699 --> 01:31:29,135
I’d sleep a lot better

1383
01:31:29,135 --> 01:31:30,615
knowing she never had
to see you again.

1384
01:31:35,838 --> 01:31:37,753
But you're too good for her,
is that it?

1385
01:31:39,972 --> 01:31:43,367
I ain’t good enough,
but you're too fucking good.

1386
01:31:47,719 --> 01:31:49,460
Why’d you have to come out here?

1387
01:31:52,594 --> 01:31:54,160
I want everyone
to stop hurting you.

1388
01:31:54,160 --> 01:31:55,597
Jesus Christ...

1389
01:31:59,992 --> 01:32:01,124
You want me to leave?

1390
01:32:02,952 --> 01:32:04,301
Yes.

1391
01:32:06,651 --> 01:32:08,697
I wouldn’t go nowhere
just yet, son.

1392
01:32:08,697 --> 01:32:11,177
I gotta decide
what to do with you.

1393
01:32:11,177 --> 01:32:13,005
I’m taking you with me.
I’m not leaving you here.

1394
01:32:13,005 --> 01:32:15,660
Hold on!
Let him go!

1395
01:32:15,660 --> 01:32:17,053
Oh, now she’s going
to get into it.

1396
01:32:17,053 --> 01:32:19,403
Watch this.
This'll be good.

1397
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:23,450
Boy, she’s one bag
of tricks, ain’t she?

1398
01:32:23,450 --> 01:32:27,542
Between you and me, reach in,
don’t know what you might get.

1399
01:32:29,805 --> 01:32:31,458
I tell you,
one time I come home,

1400
01:32:31,458 --> 01:32:35,114
she’s got some kind of
black magic going on.

1401
01:32:35,114 --> 01:32:38,030
Had them goddamn cards
spread all over the floor.

1402
01:32:38,030 --> 01:32:41,120
Candles burning
all over the house.

1403
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:43,906
Frightening scene.

1404
01:32:46,473 --> 01:32:48,388
Honey, what was it
you was trying to find

1405
01:32:48,388 --> 01:32:50,434
in the cards that night?

1406
01:32:50,434 --> 01:32:51,870
Your future?

1407
01:32:55,918 --> 01:32:57,397
Will you let me
take you home, please?

1408
01:32:57,397 --> 01:32:58,616
Just stay
away from me!

1409
01:32:58,616 --> 01:33:00,270
I want you to
get out of here!

1410
01:33:00,270 --> 01:33:01,706
I never want to
see you again, ever!

1411
01:33:01,706 --> 01:33:03,229
Jewel...
Go, go!

1412
01:33:03,229 --> 01:33:05,275
And let him go!
Don’t you dare try to stop him!

1413
01:33:05,275 --> 01:33:07,669
Sign the papers,
or don’t sign them.

1414
01:33:07,669 --> 01:33:09,409
I don’t care, because
you're dead to me anyway.

1415
01:33:09,409 --> 01:33:11,194
You’re dead to me!

1416
01:33:11,194 --> 01:33:14,110
Yeah, I’m going all right,
but I’m going by myself.

1417
01:33:14,110 --> 01:33:16,416
Don’t talk about me.
Don’t even think about me.

1418
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:18,854
Just do me
that favor.

1419
01:33:18,854 --> 01:33:20,812
You don’t want me. I’m used.

1420
01:33:20,812 --> 01:33:22,379
I’m worn-out. I’m bad goods.

1421
01:33:22,379 --> 01:33:23,641
You can’t trust me.

1422
01:33:23,641 --> 01:33:25,121
Why don’t I just go to hell?

1423
01:33:27,732 --> 01:33:29,778
You think I’m a dope?
Well, let me tell you something.

1424
01:33:29,778 --> 01:33:31,301
Deep down,
I’ve always been smart enough

1425
01:33:31,301 --> 01:33:33,346
to know this wouldn’t last.

1426
01:33:33,346 --> 01:33:35,914
You got one thing with me,
just one thing... Sex with me...

1427
01:33:35,914 --> 01:33:37,960
Jewel, that is not all
that we ever had.

1428
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:39,396
Shut up.

1429
01:33:41,616 --> 01:33:44,053
I heard the truth.

1430
01:33:44,053 --> 01:33:45,489
I heard you.

1431
01:34:50,423 --> 01:34:51,642
Grab my hand, grab my hand!

1432
01:34:51,642 --> 01:34:53,296
Hang on!

1433
01:34:54,558 --> 01:34:55,951
Watch it!

1434
01:34:59,737 --> 01:35:02,479
Ah, body block!

1435
01:35:03,959 --> 01:35:05,177
So, you're making
the old Tiptop

1436
01:35:05,177 --> 01:35:07,527
go back to
school, huh?

1437
01:35:07,527 --> 01:35:09,181
I want him
to get his master’s.

1438
01:35:09,181 --> 01:35:10,922
Yeah, and I tell her,
half of the people

1439
01:35:10,922 --> 01:35:12,184
who work
in Kings Island

1440
01:35:12,184 --> 01:35:14,056
have their master’s
in history,

1441
01:35:14,056 --> 01:35:15,753
but, you know,
what can it hurt, right?

1442
01:35:15,753 --> 01:35:17,363
Right.

1443
01:35:19,888 --> 01:35:21,280
Here, let me
get these things.

1444
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:22,673
I’ll meet you guys
up there, okay?

1445
01:35:22,673 --> 01:35:24,544
Order me a hot chocolate,
all right?

1446
01:35:37,427 --> 01:35:39,168
Laurel, hi.

1447
01:35:39,168 --> 01:35:41,474
Hi, Matt.
How are you?

1448
01:35:41,474 --> 01:35:43,868
Good. I’m... I’m good.

1449
01:35:43,868 --> 01:35:45,348
How are you?
How’s... How’s your mother?

1450
01:35:45,348 --> 01:35:48,133
She’s fine.

1451
01:35:48,133 --> 01:35:49,526
We sold the house.

1452
01:35:49,526 --> 01:35:50,788
We moved into an apartment.

1453
01:35:50,788 --> 01:35:53,225
How’s it up
in the north?

1454
01:35:53,225 --> 01:35:54,531
Oh, it’s fine.

1455
01:35:54,531 --> 01:35:56,533
It’s not too bad.
You here alone?

1456
01:35:56,533 --> 01:35:58,230
No...

1457
01:36:02,669 --> 01:36:04,193
Hi.

1458
01:36:04,193 --> 01:36:05,629
Hi.

1459
01:36:08,893 --> 01:36:11,156
Hey, Matt,
this is Steven.

1460
01:36:11,156 --> 01:36:12,418
Hi.
It’s a pleasure.

1461
01:36:12,418 --> 01:36:14,290
Same here.

1462
01:36:16,901 --> 01:36:19,861
Steven, do you want to help me
with the skates?

1463
01:36:19,861 --> 01:36:21,427
Yeah, sure.

1464
01:36:21,427 --> 01:36:22,689
I enjoyed meeting you.

1465
01:36:22,689 --> 01:36:24,779
Yeah.
Nice meeting you.

1466
01:36:26,432 --> 01:36:27,651
I wondered
if you’d be home

1467
01:36:27,651 --> 01:36:29,522
for the holidays.

1468
01:36:29,522 --> 01:36:30,785
Oh, you knew
I went away?

1469
01:36:30,785 --> 01:36:33,048
Sure, I knew.

1470
01:36:33,048 --> 01:36:34,876
How’s that
graduate school?

1471
01:36:34,876 --> 01:36:37,182
Oh, school?

1472
01:36:37,182 --> 01:36:39,402
You know,
it never ends.

1473
01:36:39,402 --> 01:36:41,621
No, I don’t guess
it ever does.

1474
01:36:43,145 --> 01:36:44,363
No.

1475
01:36:44,363 --> 01:36:46,670
Thank you.

1476
01:36:53,242 --> 01:36:56,506
Steven seems like a good...

1477
01:36:56,506 --> 01:36:57,681
A good guy.

1478
01:36:58,900 --> 01:37:00,205
He is.

1479
01:37:00,205 --> 01:37:02,512
He’s awful nice.

1480
01:37:02,512 --> 01:37:03,730
He’s in my English class.

1481
01:37:03,730 --> 01:37:05,776
Oh, good.

1482
01:37:05,776 --> 01:37:07,517
I was hoping that you’d...
go back...

1483
01:37:07,517 --> 01:37:08,997
I did.

1484
01:37:08,997 --> 01:37:10,433
I’m in Laurel’s
school.

1485
01:37:12,391 --> 01:37:14,698
Laurel’s grown up a little bit.

1486
01:37:14,698 --> 01:37:16,656
A year’s worth.

1487
01:37:23,315 --> 01:37:24,795
It’s funny.

1488
01:37:24,795 --> 01:37:26,362
In some ways,
I remember her very clearly,

1489
01:37:26,362 --> 01:37:27,798
and in other ways...

1490
01:37:27,798 --> 01:37:30,932
I think the mind
has a natural way of letting go,

1491
01:37:30,932 --> 01:37:33,499
doesn't it?

1492
01:37:37,373 --> 01:37:39,766
I guess so.

1493
01:37:51,604 --> 01:37:54,390
I have to go, Matt.

1494
01:38:09,709 --> 01:38:12,147
Thank you.
