1
00:00:38,773 --> 00:00:39,774
- Deux Dames.

2
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,553
- I gotta pee.

3
00:02:00,722 --> 00:02:02,690
- I'll find
a garage or something.

4
00:02:02,724 --> 00:02:04,859
- No, just, just pull over.

5
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:56,070
- I'm just curious, what,
what was your plan back there?

6
00:03:56,104 --> 00:03:56,971
- I dunno.

7
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:00,174
- I mean, if I hadn't
chased after you,

8
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:03,511
what would you, what
would you have done?

9
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:08,049
- I just didn't think that
far ahead, to be honest.

10
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:11,018
You're pretty out
of shape, though.

11
00:04:11,052 --> 00:04:11,886
- Hey.

12
00:04:14,155 --> 00:04:17,191
I could never keep up with you.

13
00:04:17,225 --> 00:04:18,258
Turbo.

14
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:25,166
You must be hungry.

15
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,634
Are you hungry?

16
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:30,337
I'm hungry.

17
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:04,539
- She's off, steady.

18
00:05:04,572 --> 00:05:05,840
- Down,
and she gets flipped.

19
00:05:10,211 --> 00:05:11,212
Perfect 10.

20
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:13,413
Oh, wrong strategy there.

21
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:21,823
- Uh,

22
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,492
take two of these.

23
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:31,132
- You got ID?

24
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:35,435
- Oh, they're, uh,
they're for him.

25
00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:42,076
I'll just get a pack of 27s.

26
00:06:13,274 --> 00:06:15,243
- Could you just
put this together?

27
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:20,882
Mm.

28
00:06:28,256 --> 00:06:29,090
Mm.

29
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:33,294
Want a bite?

30
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:34,128
- I'm vegan.

31
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:36,998
- You're vegan?

32
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:38,232
Since when?

33
00:06:38,266 --> 00:06:39,700
- Since I was 15.

34
00:06:41,102 --> 00:06:41,936
- Oh.

35
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,845
You know they bring drugs

36
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:53,413
into the country using
animals, don't you?

37
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:57,184
They literally shove the
cocaine up their asses.

38
00:06:57,218 --> 00:06:58,886
- That's so interesting.

39
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,389
But I don't really
do cocaine, so-

40
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,823
- Oh, yeah.

41
00:07:02,857 --> 00:07:05,192
You're more of a benzos
and opioid sort of girl.

42
00:07:07,228 --> 00:07:08,329
What a relief.

43
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:11,966
- Benzos.

44
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:37,692
- Right
field, caught!

45
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:40,227
A no-hitter for Lucas Giolito.

46
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:43,197
He no-hits the Pirates.

47
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:47,568
It's the eighth time in
the modern era the Pirates-

48
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:49,370
- You only got candies?

49
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:50,638
- Hmm?
- Okay.

50
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:52,373
Well, we'll go to
a proper restaurant

51
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:54,175
before we get to the motel.

52
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,142
- Motel?

53
00:07:55,176 --> 00:07:56,010
- Yeah.

54
00:07:57,211 --> 00:08:01,182
It's, it's like a 14-hour
drive to get to Santa Fe.

55
00:08:04,986 --> 00:08:07,888
- So, what kind of art
does this guy even do?

56
00:08:07,922 --> 00:08:10,958
- Um, all
sorts, I think.

57
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:14,528
He, he's the guy, it's the,

58
00:08:14,562 --> 00:08:17,365
remember that chef with the,
the metal plate in his head?

59
00:08:17,398 --> 00:08:19,000
- What?

60
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:20,968
- He, uh, from that breakfast
cafe you used to like,

61
00:08:21,002 --> 00:08:22,436
the, um, Cool Cats Cafe

62
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,472
and they had those amazing
chocolate chip pancakes.

63
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:26,207
Uh, well, it's his brother.

64
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,344
Uh, that, that, that's the
house that we're going to.

65
00:08:30,378 --> 00:08:32,213
Anyway, I thought it
would a, you know, hey,

66
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:35,282
it's a destination and we
could go and hang out there

67
00:08:35,316 --> 00:08:36,851
for a couple of
days and then, um,

68
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:39,487
and maybe you could tour
his studio and, you know,

69
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,991
you'd be inspired to start
painting again, maybe.

70
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:46,394
And then we'll go back.

71
00:08:46,427 --> 00:08:48,863
- Why do you care if I paint?

72
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:21,695
Can you pull over?

73
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:22,797
- No, I'm not running

74
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,331
through the desert again, sorry.

75
00:09:24,365 --> 00:09:25,366
- No, I'm seri, I'm serious.

76
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,834
Please pull over.

77
00:10:11,846 --> 00:10:14,115
That's the entrance.

78
00:10:14,148 --> 00:10:15,049
- You okay?

79
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:21,155
I know, I know this feeling.

80
00:10:22,524 --> 00:10:25,226
I know how badly you're hurting.

81
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:30,364
You know I've been there,
so the last thing you need

82
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:32,534
from me is a lecture.

83
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:37,404
But your mommy told me that,
that your face turned blue.

84
00:10:38,873 --> 00:10:40,641
I mean, do you know
what that means?

85
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:43,377
This, this is serious, you know?

86
00:10:57,992 --> 00:10:58,893
Sweetheart.

87
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:01,328
Ugh.

88
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:03,664
Very good.

89
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:04,732
Very good.

90
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:16,310
What, are you trying

91
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,513
to enter some kind of lung
cancer competition or something?

92
00:11:29,524 --> 00:11:31,458
Can't you get it to work, no?

93
00:11:31,492 --> 00:11:32,393
- Fuck's sake.

94
00:11:32,426 --> 00:11:33,327
- Hey, not the truck.

95
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,895
Don't kick the truck.

96
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:42,436
That's a shame you can't
get that cigarette lit.

97
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,338
- Isn't it?

98
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:49,710
- Oh, shit.

99
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:55,449
Oh.

100
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,352
Fuck.

101
00:11:58,385 --> 00:11:59,453
- What?

102
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:01,956
- I'm losing power in the truck.

103
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:03,525
Hold on.

104
00:12:03,558 --> 00:12:04,825
It's all right.

105
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:26,180
- Oh, come on.

106
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:27,047
Fuck.

107
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,838
- You don't happen to have a
screwdriver with you, do you?

108
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:57,344
- You've gotta
be fucking kidding me.

109
00:13:11,492 --> 00:13:14,629
- You can blame your mom for
your over-active bladder.

110
00:13:14,663 --> 00:13:16,964
When you were potty training,
she used to give you like a,

111
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:18,832
an M&M every time you
went, and I swear to God,

112
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:21,068
you went 50 times a day.

113
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:26,708
That sweet tooth
you got from me.

114
00:13:30,645 --> 00:13:31,579
- Is that all?

115
00:13:31,613 --> 00:13:32,747
- Hmm?

116
00:13:32,781 --> 00:13:35,382
- Is that all I got from you?

117
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:27,401
- Somebody order a stripper?

118
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:28,335
Hah!

119
00:14:28,369 --> 00:14:29,970
I'm just messin'.

120
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:31,939
And it's not just
your star sign.

121
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:34,074
I can guess anyone's age, too.

122
00:14:34,108 --> 00:14:36,143
It's a gift I've had
since I was a girl.

123
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:38,747
I guessed everyone in my town.

124
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,649
Yeah, the paper reported
on it back in '64.

125
00:14:41,683 --> 00:14:44,084
Got my picture taken
and everything.

126
00:14:44,118 --> 00:14:48,723
I was the biggest thing to
happen here since that UFO.

127
00:14:48,757 --> 00:14:50,157
- There was a UFO sighting here?

128
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,959
- Oh, hell yes there was.

129
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:54,863
There's all kinds of crazy
extra-terrestrial shit that goes

130
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:56,598
on in these areas.

131
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,100
All righty.

132
00:15:01,435 --> 00:15:03,638
I'm gonna guess now, okay?

133
00:15:03,671 --> 00:15:04,639
Okay.

134
00:15:05,707 --> 00:15:06,641
Hmm.

135
00:15:07,742 --> 00:15:08,576
Let's see.

136
00:15:11,846 --> 00:15:12,647
Libra?

137
00:15:13,648 --> 00:15:14,481
25.

138
00:15:16,785 --> 00:15:17,652
Sagittarius.

139
00:15:19,153 --> 00:15:19,987
Eh, 37.

140
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:22,724
- No.

141
00:15:22,757 --> 00:15:24,726
- Close, close.

142
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:27,529
I'm a Libra, but I'm 20.

143
00:15:27,562 --> 00:15:30,063
And he's an Aries and he's 47.

144
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:34,101
- Shit!

145
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:35,469
- It was close, it was close.

146
00:15:35,503 --> 00:15:36,437
- Eh.

147
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,337
- You got it very close.

148
00:15:37,371 --> 00:15:38,338
- But you know what?

149
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:40,542
I practice ancient
Vedic astrology.

150
00:15:40,575 --> 00:15:44,111
I don't go in for that
Western hipster shit.

151
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:46,614
They don't even take into
account the wobble of the Earth

152
00:15:46,648 --> 00:15:49,818
and I think that's where
the disconnect happens.

153
00:15:49,851 --> 00:15:50,685
- Right.

154
00:15:50,718 --> 00:15:52,119
That makes sense.

155
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:53,987
- 47?

156
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:56,758
Ain't no judgment here.

157
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,392
I mean, love is love, man.

158
00:15:58,425 --> 00:15:59,661
- Oh, no.

159
00:15:59,694 --> 00:16:02,362
- You know, my parents
were together for 72 years.

160
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:06,568
They died when they were
90 years old within seconds

161
00:16:06,601 --> 00:16:07,968
of each other.

162
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:10,137
- Oh, there's something
beautiful about that.

163
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,508
- Mama died first 'cause
she was sitting on the front

164
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,777
of the motorcycle and
took most of the impact.

165
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:18,580
And Daddy got
flung off the back.

166
00:16:18,613 --> 00:16:19,747
- Oh, I'm sorry.

167
00:16:21,883 --> 00:16:22,884
- Oh, man.

168
00:16:22,917 --> 00:16:23,818
- Yeah.

169
00:16:23,852 --> 00:16:24,752
I'm sorry about that.

170
00:16:24,786 --> 00:16:25,587
- Yeah.

171
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,688
That was bad.

172
00:16:27,755 --> 00:16:28,890
Oh, well.

173
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:39,601
Hey, you two mind if we
make a quick pit stop?

174
00:16:39,634 --> 00:16:42,369
- Oh, well the thing is, we're
on a bit of a tight schedule.

175
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:45,005
We need to push on
really, I'm afraid.

176
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:46,306
- Are we?

177
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,308
- It'll only take but a second.

178
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:50,110
Can you do me a favor and
reach in the back there

179
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:52,179
and grab that package?

180
00:16:56,283 --> 00:16:56,885
- Oh.

181
00:16:56,918 --> 00:16:57,919
- Ah.

182
00:16:57,952 --> 00:16:58,920
Ha-ha.

183
00:16:58,953 --> 00:17:00,454
She's a beaut', ain't she?

184
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:03,758
Oh, don't worry, the bullets
are in the birthday card.

185
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:04,859
- Okay.

186
00:17:04,893 --> 00:17:07,795
- It's a gift for my nephew.

187
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:08,630
- Right.

188
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:13,868
- Hey, you know, my
brother has been working

189
00:17:13,902 --> 00:17:15,369
on cars his whole life.

190
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:18,940
I bet he could fix her up
for ya and it would only,

191
00:17:18,973 --> 00:17:21,943
it'd be cheaper and a,
and a lot faster than-

192
00:17:21,976 --> 00:17:23,243
- I think a-

193
00:17:23,277 --> 00:17:24,546
- The joint that I'd
have to take you to.

194
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:25,713
- Well, I should
probably just go to the,

195
00:17:25,747 --> 00:17:26,848
some professional place.

196
00:17:26,881 --> 00:17:28,415
I wouldn't want to get-
- No!

197
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:30,618
I'm telling you, his garage
is a car mechanic's heaven.

198
00:17:30,652 --> 00:17:31,786
- Okay.

199
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:33,153
- Works for me.
- Okay, thanks.

200
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:34,789
- My nephew
is gonna love it.

201
00:17:34,822 --> 00:17:36,591
- Yeah, that's a beauty.
- Big guy.

202
00:17:36,624 --> 00:17:39,027
- That's a lovely gun.
- Yeah, you keep it.

203
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,528
Not ours.

204
00:17:40,562 --> 00:17:41,295
- No, it's not loaded.

205
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:42,630
It's not loaded, right?

206
00:17:42,664 --> 00:17:44,032
- Are you deaf?

207
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:47,635
I said the bullets were
in the birthday card.

208
00:17:57,545 --> 00:18:01,583
Now, don't make direct
eye contact with anyone.

209
00:18:13,027 --> 00:18:15,830
Come on.

210
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,414
- Don't you think
it's a bit ironic?

211
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:35,282
- What?

212
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:39,286
- Well, you know, you take
me on this trip to, what,

213
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,655
keep me out of danger,

214
00:18:40,688 --> 00:18:42,824
and then we end up in
a truck with a stranger

215
00:18:42,857 --> 00:18:45,793
and a gun in the
middle of nowhere.

216
00:18:51,532 --> 00:18:53,901
- I'm not, I'm not
just taking you

217
00:18:53,935 --> 00:18:55,335
to keep you out of danger.

218
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:59,040
I, I'm happy to be
with you, you know?

219
00:18:59,073 --> 00:18:59,941
- Hi.

220
00:18:59,974 --> 00:19:00,942
How you doing?

221
00:19:00,975 --> 00:19:02,043
- Hello.

222
00:19:02,076 --> 00:19:03,811
- Hello.
- How are you?

223
00:19:03,845 --> 00:19:04,879
- Hey.
- To meet you.

224
00:19:04,912 --> 00:19:06,681
- Nice to meet you.

225
00:19:06,714 --> 00:19:09,951
It seems very dear,
classic truck there.

226
00:19:09,984 --> 00:19:11,019
- Yeah.

227
00:19:11,052 --> 00:19:12,620
It's an old '80s, uh, Sierra.

228
00:19:12,654 --> 00:19:15,890
We've got a problem
with the radiator.

229
00:19:25,633 --> 00:19:26,634
- All right.

230
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:28,435
There we go.

231
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:32,073
All right, you said you
wanted a, what do you want?

232
00:19:32,106 --> 00:19:34,075
You said you wanted
a little puppy?

233
00:19:34,108 --> 00:19:35,777
You said you wanted
a little puppy?

234
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,045
Bet you can't get my nose.

235
00:19:37,078 --> 00:19:39,446
Bet you can't get my nose!

236
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:42,482
You want a dog or what?

237
00:19:42,517 --> 00:19:43,350
Here.

238
00:19:44,085 --> 00:19:45,920
This, one, one at a time.

239
00:19:45,953 --> 00:19:46,788
One at a time.

240
00:19:46,821 --> 00:19:47,655
One at a time.

241
00:19:47,689 --> 00:19:48,388
One at a time.

242
00:19:48,422 --> 00:19:49,023
Hold up.

243
00:19:49,057 --> 00:19:50,058
Hold up.

244
00:19:50,091 --> 00:19:50,925
Hold up.

245
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:52,860
Hold on.

246
00:19:52,894 --> 00:19:54,095
Hold on.

247
00:19:54,128 --> 00:19:55,195
You gotta let me
make it first, dude.

248
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:56,064
You gotta let me make it first.

249
00:19:58,099 --> 00:19:58,900
Stop.

250
00:19:58,933 --> 00:19:59,734
Stop.

251
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:00,668
Stop, stop.

252
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,138
- My birthday's coming up.

253
00:20:04,172 --> 00:20:05,606
- Yeah?

254
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,144
My, uh, aunt makes me do
this every year, so...

255
00:20:10,178 --> 00:20:13,213
All right, all right, all right.

256
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:16,718
Can I get ya anything,
like, uh, you want a burger

257
00:20:16,751 --> 00:20:19,821
or like a, I think we got some
potato salad or something.

258
00:20:19,854 --> 00:20:21,421
- I'll take a beer.

259
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:23,591
- We can get ya
back on the road.

260
00:20:23,624 --> 00:20:25,126
And I got quite a bit
of tools in my garage.

261
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:26,027
- Oh, great.

262
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,061
- Yeah.

263
00:20:27,095 --> 00:20:29,664
A GMC cla, classic, huh?

264
00:20:29,697 --> 00:20:30,965
- Yeah.

265
00:20:30,998 --> 00:20:33,101
- A friend of mine had one
of these beautiful trucks.

266
00:20:33,134 --> 00:20:33,935
- Oh, he did?

267
00:20:33,968 --> 00:20:35,036
- Yeah.

268
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:36,470
And tells me about-
- Yeah?

269
00:20:36,504 --> 00:20:38,405
- Going on a road
trip, yeah, together.

270
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:40,108
They sure perform good.

271
00:20:40,141 --> 00:20:41,441
- Oh, that's cool.

272
00:20:41,475 --> 00:20:42,677
- Yeah.

273
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,745
- Well, we just need to
get it down and off the,

274
00:20:43,778 --> 00:20:44,779
uh, tow truck.

275
00:20:44,812 --> 00:20:45,913
I don't know how to do that.

276
00:20:45,947 --> 00:20:47,314
- Oh.

277
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:48,415
- Is Elsie, is she a
relation of yours, Elsie?

278
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:49,183
- She's a sister-in-law of mine.

279
00:20:49,217 --> 00:20:50,084
- Oh, okay.

280
00:20:50,118 --> 00:20:51,185
- Yeah.
- Elsie!

281
00:20:51,219 --> 00:20:53,654
- She brings me abandoned cars.

282
00:20:53,688 --> 00:20:54,488
man.

283
00:20:55,156 --> 00:20:56,557
Nice truck.

284
00:20:56,591 --> 00:20:57,925
Nice GMC.

285
00:20:57,959 --> 00:21:00,561
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, beautiful.

286
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:06,901
- Welcome to mi casa.

287
00:21:11,172 --> 00:21:12,006
Yeah.

288
00:21:14,976 --> 00:21:18,880
Here you go.

289
00:21:18,913 --> 00:21:20,413
So, you paint?

290
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:21,314
- Yeah.
- That's cool.

291
00:21:21,348 --> 00:21:22,517
That's cool.

292
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:25,753
I paint a little bit
myself, actually.

293
00:21:25,787 --> 00:21:26,621
- Mm.

294
00:21:26,654 --> 00:21:27,387
- Yeah.

295
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,456
Well, I mean, graffiti.

296
00:21:31,225 --> 00:21:33,326
Yeah, me and my boys
actually just, uh,

297
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,963
tagged the old Dollar General.

298
00:21:35,997 --> 00:21:37,430
- Mm.

299
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:40,201
- It said, "Anarchy is
democracy taken seriously."

300
00:21:40,234 --> 00:21:42,136
- Nice.

301
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:44,404
- Real big.

302
00:21:44,437 --> 00:21:46,040
Yeah, it's kinda dumb.

303
00:21:46,073 --> 00:21:47,041
But whatever.

304
00:21:54,081 --> 00:21:56,918
So, uh, what do you paint?

305
00:21:56,951 --> 00:22:00,353
- Oh, I don't, I don't
really paint much anymore.

306
00:22:00,387 --> 00:22:01,155
- What?

307
00:22:01,189 --> 00:22:02,056
Why not?

308
00:22:03,858 --> 00:22:07,028
- Just ran out of
inspiration, I guess.

309
00:22:07,061 --> 00:22:08,930
- That's fucking bullshit.

310
00:22:11,699 --> 00:22:16,671
Just saying, like it's, you
should keep fucking painting.

311
00:22:20,274 --> 00:22:23,443
I actually make music
for inspiration.

312
00:22:24,212 --> 00:22:26,080
I'll play you something.

313
00:22:26,113 --> 00:22:27,215
I'm a musician.

314
00:22:31,219 --> 00:22:33,054
Yeah.

315
00:22:33,087 --> 00:22:34,188
Yeah.

316
00:22:34,222 --> 00:22:35,723
Yeah

317
00:22:41,229 --> 00:22:42,063
Shit.

318
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,108
- Hey, can I-
- Hmm?

319
00:22:54,141 --> 00:22:55,343
- Can I use the, uh,

320
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:56,043
do you have a
bathroom I could use?

321
00:22:56,077 --> 00:22:56,711
- Yeah.

322
00:22:56,744 --> 00:22:57,678
Yeah.

323
00:22:57,712 --> 00:23:00,915
Right down the
hall.

324
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:03,918
- That, that
was really good, though.

325
00:23:03,951 --> 00:23:05,620
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

326
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:07,214
Wanna take some shots?

327
00:24:10,384 --> 00:24:12,353
- Hmm.

328
00:24:12,386 --> 00:24:13,187
Nice.

329
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:26,267
- Oh, fucking hell.

330
00:24:31,906 --> 00:24:33,174
- Beautiful color.

331
00:24:33,207 --> 00:24:34,976
Why, why the sticker?

332
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,511
- Well, it's my, the
name of my business.

333
00:24:37,545 --> 00:24:40,014
You know, I'm a, a, like
a landscape company.

334
00:24:40,047 --> 00:24:41,949
It's just a little one.

335
00:24:41,983 --> 00:24:43,351
- Yeah?

336
00:24:43,384 --> 00:24:45,286
I think the truck looks
a whole lot better

337
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:48,122
without it.

338
00:24:48,155 --> 00:24:48,990
Yeah.

339
00:24:59,033 --> 00:25:00,201
- Cheers.

340
00:25:09,143 --> 00:25:10,211
- You want another one?

341
00:25:10,244 --> 00:25:12,146
- Yeah.

342
00:25:17,118 --> 00:25:17,952
Ah.

343
00:25:19,553 --> 00:25:21,222
I like your house.

344
00:25:22,089 --> 00:25:23,324
- Oh, yeah?

345
00:25:23,357 --> 00:25:25,326
Wait, you wanna move in?

346
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:26,227
- Yeah.

347
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,294
Sure.

348
00:25:27,328 --> 00:25:28,262
Why not?

349
00:25:31,632 --> 00:25:34,001
- So, like what do you do?

350
00:25:35,469 --> 00:25:38,272
Do you like model or something?

351
00:25:38,305 --> 00:25:39,473
No, I'm just kidding.

352
00:25:39,508 --> 00:25:40,408
No, but seriously,
are you a model?

353
00:25:40,441 --> 00:25:41,542
Just tell me.

354
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:43,544
- Pass.

355
00:25:43,577 --> 00:25:44,912
Next question.

356
00:25:48,349 --> 00:25:49,283
- Okay.

357
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,321
Are you single?

358
00:25:54,355 --> 00:25:55,389
Pass.

359
00:25:55,423 --> 00:25:56,257
Next question.

360
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:57,124
- Geez.

361
00:26:00,361 --> 00:26:02,797
Are you fucking with me?

362
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:03,798
- Pass.

363
00:26:03,831 --> 00:26:04,665
Next question.
- Oh, okay.

364
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:06,600
All right.

365
00:26:13,908 --> 00:26:14,742
So,

366
00:26:20,147 --> 00:26:21,115
be honest.

367
00:26:21,148 --> 00:26:22,883
Do you think I'm sexy?

368
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:24,519
- Pass.

369
00:26:24,553 --> 00:26:28,456
Next question.

370
00:26:28,489 --> 00:26:30,458
- Is that your
boyfriend outside?

371
00:26:30,491 --> 00:26:31,725
- God, no!

372
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:35,229
Why does everyone
keep assuming that?

373
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:36,931
- Oh, hey.
- Oh, okay, let's go.

374
00:26:36,964 --> 00:26:38,265
- No, we're just
having a conversation.

375
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:39,500
- Now!
- Excuse me.

376
00:26:39,534 --> 00:26:40,367
- We're leaving.

377
00:26:40,401 --> 00:26:41,402
I fixed the truck.

378
00:26:41,435 --> 00:26:42,504
Let's go.

379
00:26:42,537 --> 00:26:43,337
- Well, I'm not going with you.

380
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:44,705
- Yes, you are!

381
00:26:44,738 --> 00:26:45,940
- No, I'll get my own
ride back to the city.

382
00:26:45,973 --> 00:26:47,475
- I can give you a
ride if you want.

383
00:26:47,509 --> 00:26:48,709
- He'll give me a ride.

384
00:26:48,742 --> 00:26:49,810
- I'm not
leaving you here.

385
00:26:49,844 --> 00:26:50,711
- Well, I'm not going with you.

386
00:26:50,744 --> 00:26:51,513
- Okay, relax, dude.

387
00:26:51,546 --> 00:26:53,180
All right?

388
00:26:53,214 --> 00:26:54,615
- Look, why don't you just
mind your own fucking business?

389
00:26:54,648 --> 00:26:55,449
- Hey, don't speak
to him like that.

390
00:26:55,483 --> 00:26:56,951
It's his house.

391
00:26:56,984 --> 00:26:58,719
- You can't speak to me
like that here in my house.

392
00:26:58,752 --> 00:26:59,588
- Are you used to serving
underage girls in your house?

393
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,488
- God!

394
00:27:00,522 --> 00:27:01,523
Dad!

395
00:27:01,556 --> 00:27:02,456
- Underage one here?

396
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:04,125
- Yeah, she's not 21.

397
00:27:05,192 --> 00:27:06,060
- Okay.

398
00:27:06,093 --> 00:27:07,128
I didn't know that.

399
00:27:07,161 --> 00:27:08,929
- 12 hours ago, 12
hours ago you OD'd!

400
00:27:08,963 --> 00:27:11,432
And here you are fucking
drunk and God knows what else.

401
00:27:11,465 --> 00:27:13,501
- I'm not drunk!

402
00:27:13,535 --> 00:27:14,935
- Okay.

403
00:27:14,969 --> 00:27:17,304
Okay look, I'm on parole
right now, kinda, so I-

404
00:27:17,338 --> 00:27:18,873
- But we weren't even drinking.

405
00:27:18,906 --> 00:27:20,040
So-
- That's not true.

406
00:27:20,074 --> 00:27:21,510
She-
- Oh, stop.

407
00:27:21,543 --> 00:27:22,577
- No, no, you had one
beer and two shots.

408
00:27:22,611 --> 00:27:25,379
- Stop talking, stop talking.

409
00:27:25,412 --> 00:27:26,313
- Whoa, hey.

410
00:27:26,347 --> 00:27:27,214
No, no.

411
00:27:27,248 --> 00:27:28,782
- Fucking dick ass!

412
00:27:30,451 --> 00:27:32,419
Why did you even
come this morning?

413
00:27:32,453 --> 00:27:33,420
- Because I'm your father!

414
00:27:33,454 --> 00:27:34,255
- Since when?

415
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:36,423
- Whoa!

416
00:27:36,457 --> 00:27:37,491
God.

417
00:27:44,566 --> 00:27:46,433
- All right.
- Sorry to step out.

418
00:27:46,467 --> 00:27:48,269
Thank you.

419
00:27:56,545 --> 00:27:58,513
- Leaving already?
- Oh, Amos.

420
00:27:58,547 --> 00:27:59,548
Yeah.

421
00:28:01,048 --> 00:28:02,651
- I got something
that I'd like you to have.

422
00:28:02,683 --> 00:28:03,484
- Oh, that's all,
you're very kind, we-

423
00:28:03,518 --> 00:28:04,586
- Oh, I insist.

424
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:06,120
I insist.
- Oh.

425
00:28:06,153 --> 00:28:06,954
- Okay?
- Yeah.

426
00:28:06,987 --> 00:28:07,821
Thanks.

427
00:28:11,725 --> 00:28:13,494
- I grow this myself.

428
00:28:13,528 --> 00:28:15,129
And we'd like you to have.

429
00:28:15,162 --> 00:28:16,330
A gift for you.

430
00:28:16,363 --> 00:28:17,698
- Nice to meet you.

431
00:28:17,731 --> 00:28:18,799
But I, this is too much.

432
00:28:18,832 --> 00:28:19,967
We, we don't need-

433
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,935
- Ah.

434
00:28:20,968 --> 00:28:22,571
But it's my pleasure
to help you.

435
00:28:22,604 --> 00:28:23,971
- Well, thank you so
much and thanks for

436
00:28:24,004 --> 00:28:26,508
your help with the
truck and that.

437
00:28:26,541 --> 00:28:28,577
Thanks for the pumpkin, yeah.

438
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:30,110
I'll put it in here.

439
00:28:30,144 --> 00:28:30,945
There we go.

440
00:28:30,978 --> 00:28:32,179
Okay.

441
00:28:32,213 --> 00:28:33,280
Thanks, guys.

442
00:28:33,314 --> 00:28:36,217
- Safe travels.
- Take care.

443
00:28:52,366 --> 00:28:54,935
How much did you have to drink?

444
00:29:02,309 --> 00:29:03,143
Hello!

445
00:29:04,245 --> 00:29:06,247
Oh, no jokes for me now?

446
00:29:07,248 --> 00:29:08,082
Okay.

447
00:29:10,652 --> 00:29:14,788
You have no idea how
lucky you are to be alive.

448
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,794
Turbo?

449
00:30:21,756 --> 00:30:22,691
- Oh, fuck no.

450
00:30:22,724 --> 00:30:23,957
I'm not going in there.

451
00:30:23,991 --> 00:30:25,959
I don't even believe in God.

452
00:30:25,993 --> 00:30:28,362
- It's an AA meeting.

453
00:30:28,395 --> 00:30:29,698
- - Yeah, I know.

454
00:30:29,731 --> 00:30:31,165
They try to turn you
into some Jesus freak.

455
00:30:31,198 --> 00:30:31,832
I'm not going.

456
00:30:31,865 --> 00:30:33,334
- No, they don't.

457
00:30:33,367 --> 00:30:35,670
I think it would do us both
good to go to a meeting.

458
00:30:35,704 --> 00:30:36,504
- Us?

459
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:38,972
No, I'm good.

460
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:41,875
You go ahead to your cult-y
little group meeting.

461
00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:45,547
- Look, if you don't
like it, then, you know,

462
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,014
we can leave early.

463
00:30:47,047 --> 00:30:48,616
We don't have to, But I
haven't been to a meeting

464
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:52,319
for a while, and I think it
would be good for both of us.

465
00:30:52,353 --> 00:30:54,955
- If I go in, will you
take me back to San Diego?

466
00:30:54,988 --> 00:30:57,358
- Why would you want to
go back to San Diego?

467
00:30:57,391 --> 00:30:58,926
- Because it's my home.

468
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:00,729
- Yeah, but you don't really
have a home there just now.

469
00:31:00,762 --> 00:31:02,664
- I, I have options.

470
00:31:02,697 --> 00:31:04,699
- It really doesn't
seem like you do.

471
00:31:04,733 --> 00:31:06,266
- Well, you really
don't know me.

472
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:11,305
So, I don't see how you would
have any concept of that.

473
00:31:12,239 --> 00:31:14,441
- Well, I would like
to get to know you.

474
00:31:14,475 --> 00:31:15,777
That's why I'm here.

475
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:17,244
I, and I would like to
think there's a hint

476
00:31:17,277 --> 00:31:18,680
of a chance that you'd
like to get to know me too.

477
00:31:18,713 --> 00:31:20,247
- No, thank you.

478
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,856
- Wh, when you woke up in the
hospital room this morning,

479
00:31:27,921 --> 00:31:29,624
did that feel good?

480
00:31:30,692 --> 00:31:33,127
Look, I know you don't, you
don't wanna hear it from me,

481
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:38,332
but trust me that this path
you're on, it's not worth it.

482
00:31:39,032 --> 00:31:41,168
- Why would I ever trust you?

483
00:31:42,236 --> 00:31:42,837
- Oh.

484
00:31:42,871 --> 00:31:43,671
Oh, okay.

485
00:31:45,874 --> 00:31:46,674
Okay.

486
00:31:47,975 --> 00:31:48,877
- Go ahead, then.

487
00:32:43,197 --> 00:32:46,534
- Uh, it's, it's
really fun, isn't it?

488
00:32:47,234 --> 00:32:48,335
I mean, it wouldn't be so hard

489
00:32:48,368 --> 00:32:51,138
to stop if it wasn't fun, right?

490
00:32:51,171 --> 00:32:54,542
Getting high and, uh,
drinking and partying.

491
00:32:54,576 --> 00:32:56,477
I mean, it's, it's fun.

492
00:32:57,444 --> 00:32:59,781
Uh, until it's not.

493
00:32:59,814 --> 00:33:02,617
And then things
start to slip away.

494
00:33:03,852 --> 00:33:09,256
Uh, slowly at first, my life
started to slip away from me,

495
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:12,159
um, and then all
of a sudden, it,

496
00:33:13,193 --> 00:33:16,764
it just turned to shit
really quick and, um, I,

497
00:33:18,365 --> 00:33:20,033
I don't like to
think back to then.

498
00:33:20,067 --> 00:33:22,670
I, I, I wish that it didn't
have to have been a part

499
00:33:22,704 --> 00:33:24,238
of my story, but it is.

500
00:33:24,271 --> 00:33:28,743
And, uh, I was, um, well,
I was acting like a child,

501
00:33:31,813 --> 00:33:34,414
but, but I, I, I had a child.

502
00:33:35,482 --> 00:33:40,153
And, uh, I just guess I
d, I didn't really know

503
00:33:40,187 --> 00:33:42,757
what it meant to be a father.

504
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,996
I remember this one
time I was coming home.

505
00:33:48,028 --> 00:33:50,030
Uh, the sun was coming
up and I was walking out

506
00:33:50,063 --> 00:33:51,599
of a blackout.

507
00:33:51,633 --> 00:33:54,268
I had no idea where I
was, uh, had been or, uh,

508
00:33:54,301 --> 00:33:57,739
no idea who I had been with
or what I'd been up to.

509
00:33:57,772 --> 00:34:02,142
But I came into the house
and, um, my now ex-wife

510
00:34:03,377 --> 00:34:07,615
was with my little girl, and
she was only four or five.

511
00:34:07,649 --> 00:34:10,018
- And I could never forget
the way that she looked at me,

512
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,887
that, she was just trying

513
00:34:12,921 --> 00:34:14,421
to figure out what
was wrong with me,

514
00:34:14,454 --> 00:34:16,891
but, uh, but at the
same time that she was,

515
00:34:16,925 --> 00:34:20,160
um, she was frightened
of me, you know.

516
00:34:21,161 --> 00:34:23,698
Uh, I was a stranger to her.

517
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,304
But even though that kind
of thing would happen,

518
00:34:30,337 --> 00:34:32,172
and even though I didn't
want to drink anymore,

519
00:34:32,205 --> 00:34:33,741
it did, I hated it.

520
00:34:33,775 --> 00:34:37,645
I, I, I, I hated the way my
life felt to live that way.

521
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,581
I couldn't stop.

522
00:34:39,614 --> 00:34:41,983
I tried all, probably all
the things we all did,

523
00:34:42,016 --> 00:34:44,986
you know, like cutting
down or I'll only drink

524
00:34:45,019 --> 00:34:46,588
on a Thursday and a Friday

525
00:34:46,621 --> 00:34:48,723
and if I drink all day
Thursday and all day Friday,

526
00:34:48,756 --> 00:34:49,991
you know.

527
00:34:50,024 --> 00:34:51,926
I just couldn't stop.

528
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,528
I couldn't do it.

529
00:34:53,561 --> 00:34:56,096
And, uh, it just sort of
led me to the point where I,

530
00:34:56,129 --> 00:34:59,166
I think I felt like if
I run away, you know,

531
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:02,837
if I like blow my life
up, then I'll stop...

532
00:35:45,013 --> 00:35:48,016
- So, you
are religious now.

533
00:35:48,049 --> 00:35:49,316
- No.

534
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:51,284
Not particularly, no.

535
00:35:52,687 --> 00:35:55,957
But I do like the
idea of something
greater than ourselves,

536
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:58,893
you know, like a
higher power, like,

537
00:36:00,995 --> 00:36:02,429
I've been waiting to tell you-

538
00:36:02,462 --> 00:36:04,932
- I, I see two new faces.

539
00:36:04,966 --> 00:36:06,333
Glad you could join us.

540
00:36:06,366 --> 00:36:07,769
- Thank you for having us.
- Hey.

541
00:36:07,802 --> 00:36:08,636
Shiloh.

542
00:36:11,105 --> 00:36:13,608
Is this your first meeting?

543
00:36:13,641 --> 00:36:14,474
- Yeah.

544
00:36:15,442 --> 00:36:18,746
- Do you
have any questions?

545
00:36:19,647 --> 00:36:20,748
- Not really.

546
00:36:23,584 --> 00:36:25,419
- Do you
wanna join the program?

547
00:36:25,452 --> 00:36:26,286
- No.

548
00:36:27,155 --> 00:36:29,991
- What brought
you in here today?

549
00:36:30,024 --> 00:36:31,626
- He did.

550
00:36:31,659 --> 00:36:32,492
- Oh.

551
00:36:33,895 --> 00:36:35,963
Well, no one can
want this for you.

552
00:36:35,997 --> 00:36:38,599
You gotta want
this for yourself.

553
00:36:38,633 --> 00:36:39,466
- Right.

554
00:36:41,736 --> 00:36:43,303
- What do you want?

555
00:36:44,505 --> 00:36:45,973
- Honestly?

556
00:36:51,112 --> 00:36:52,814
- Thank you.

557
00:36:52,847 --> 00:36:53,681
All right.

558
00:37:03,024 --> 00:37:04,892
Aren't you hungry?

559
00:37:04,926 --> 00:37:06,426
- I thought I was.

560
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:18,238
I really hate those meetings.

561
00:37:18,271 --> 00:37:20,508
The public speaking.

562
00:37:20,541 --> 00:37:23,010
I just, I just
could never do that.

563
00:37:23,044 --> 00:37:24,444
- Oh, yeah?

564
00:37:24,478 --> 00:37:25,479
- Yeah.

565
00:37:25,513 --> 00:37:27,548
Just talking to
everyone like that.

566
00:37:27,582 --> 00:37:30,417
- Well, I wasn't
talking to everyone.

567
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:32,419
I was talking to you.

568
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,763
- So, how'd you sell me to him?

569
00:37:42,697 --> 00:37:43,765
- I'm sorry?

570
00:37:43,798 --> 00:37:44,665
- Your friend.

571
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:45,900
What was your pitch?

572
00:37:45,933 --> 00:37:47,568
"Hey man, I know I haven't
seen you in a decade,

573
00:37:47,602 --> 00:37:50,071
but my daughter just OD'd
and I have no idea what

574
00:37:50,104 --> 00:37:51,105
to do with her.

575
00:37:51,139 --> 00:37:52,140
Anyway, see you tomorrow.

576
00:37:52,173 --> 00:37:55,743
Hide your booze."

577
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:02,016
- Okay.

578
00:38:03,316 --> 00:38:07,420
- You know, I'm really not
addicted to this stuff.

579
00:38:08,756 --> 00:38:12,026
Like I, I don't need
it all the time.

580
00:38:13,127 --> 00:38:14,962
- Then stop.

581
00:38:14,996 --> 00:38:15,863
- Well, I,

582
00:38:17,231 --> 00:38:20,134
I don't really see why
I would if it's not-

583
00:38:20,168 --> 00:38:21,202
- I should take this.

584
00:38:21,235 --> 00:38:22,036
Sorry.

585
00:38:22,069 --> 00:38:22,937
Really sorry.

586
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:24,272
I'll be right back.

587
00:38:49,197 --> 00:38:50,798
- Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho.

588
00:38:52,266 --> 00:38:53,466
Ugh-huh-huh.

589
00:38:55,036 --> 00:38:56,537
Ah-ha.

590
00:38:56,571 --> 00:38:57,238
Ugh!

591
00:40:14,048 --> 00:40:16,183
- I don't think that was yours.

592
00:40:16,217 --> 00:40:19,053
- Excuse me?
- Don't play dumb.

593
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:21,289
- Oh, um, well, I just assumed

594
00:40:21,322 --> 00:40:24,892
that no one would
come back for it, so-

595
00:40:28,262 --> 00:40:29,163
- Yeah.

596
00:40:31,399 --> 00:40:33,334
No, well, 30 days.

597
00:40:33,367 --> 00:40:35,169
Is that the minimum?

598
00:40:37,772 --> 00:40:38,572
Okay.

599
00:40:42,576 --> 00:40:43,978
No, no, no, no.

600
00:40:44,011 --> 00:40:46,314
Out-patient, that,
it won't work for us.

601
00:40:46,347 --> 00:40:49,482
She needs, she needs
to to stay there.

602
00:40:50,318 --> 00:40:53,721
- I'm gonna need to see some ID.

603
00:40:53,754 --> 00:40:56,991
- Uh, I, uh, I
don't have it on me.

604
00:40:57,024 --> 00:40:58,326
- Okay, I'm
just gonna have to talk

605
00:40:58,359 --> 00:40:59,360
to your father about this.

606
00:40:59,393 --> 00:41:00,328
- No, no, no.

607
00:41:00,361 --> 00:41:01,395
No.

608
00:41:01,429 --> 00:41:02,229
Please, please don't do that.

609
00:41:02,263 --> 00:41:03,097
Um...

610
00:41:19,046 --> 00:41:21,048
Um, should we get going?

611
00:41:22,016 --> 00:41:23,384
- Yeah.

612
00:41:23,417 --> 00:41:24,251
You okay?

613
00:41:24,285 --> 00:41:25,086
- Yeah.

614
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:25,953
Yep.

615
00:41:35,029 --> 00:41:38,866
- Could I get this in
a box, please, to go?

616
00:41:38,899 --> 00:41:39,734
Thanks.

617
00:42:04,725 --> 00:42:06,027
- You're j-j-jammin'

618
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:09,864
with the hottest disc
jockey, disc jockey.

619
00:42:12,366 --> 00:42:14,268
- Oh, wait a minute.

620
00:42:14,301 --> 00:42:15,302
Oh, come on!

621
00:43:00,981 --> 00:43:02,450
- Come on.

622
00:43:03,918 --> 00:43:04,985
Come on.

623
00:44:26,601 --> 00:44:27,569
- Oh.

624
00:44:27,602 --> 00:44:29,069
Sorry.

625
00:44:29,103 --> 00:44:29,937
Hello?

626
00:44:31,372 --> 00:44:32,439
Oh, hello, my love.

627
00:44:32,473 --> 00:44:33,508
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

628
00:44:33,542 --> 00:44:34,408
Of course.

629
00:44:34,441 --> 00:44:35,910
Hello, wee man.

630
00:44:35,943 --> 00:44:37,978
What did you do today?

631
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:43,317
Oh, that's, well, you'll have
to show me when I get home.

632
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:47,788
I, what book are you gonna
read with mommy tonight?

633
00:44:47,821 --> 00:44:49,323
Oh, yeah, that's a good one.

634
00:44:49,356 --> 00:44:52,561
All right my wee man,
I love you so much.

635
00:44:52,594 --> 00:44:56,363
I lo, yeah, bigger than
the whole universe.

636
00:44:57,464 --> 00:45:00,100
Why, thank you my darling.

637
00:45:00,134 --> 00:45:00,901
Yep.

638
00:45:00,935 --> 00:45:01,603
Yeah, yeah, it's good.

639
00:45:01,636 --> 00:45:02,436
Yep.

640
00:45:02,469 --> 00:45:04,171
Great.

641
00:45:04,205 --> 00:45:06,707
I'll call, I'll call you, I'll
call you when we get there.

642
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:09,109
All right my darling, bye.

643
00:45:12,746 --> 00:45:16,383
They'd really like to
meet you, you know.

644
00:45:17,284 --> 00:45:19,320
- I'd really like to pee.

645
00:45:44,178 --> 00:45:44,912
- Ow.

646
00:45:54,656 --> 00:45:56,658
- Do you want me
to pull over again?

647
00:45:56,691 --> 00:45:57,958
- No, I'm fine.

648
00:46:01,962 --> 00:46:03,632
- Throws
it into center field.

649
00:46:03,665 --> 00:46:05,099
And then close.

650
00:46:07,801 --> 00:46:09,203
- Oh, that's right.

651
00:46:09,236 --> 00:46:10,672
The Pads are playing
the Braves tonight.

652
00:46:10,705 --> 00:46:11,905
- Okay.

653
00:46:11,939 --> 00:46:13,374
- Do you remember
that game we went

654
00:46:13,407 --> 00:46:15,276
to when The Cowboy hit the
homer and you caught it?

655
00:46:15,309 --> 00:46:18,412
Like it, it, it literally came
down in your little hands.

656
00:46:18,445 --> 00:46:19,614
Do you remember?

657
00:46:19,648 --> 00:46:21,015
- Nope.
- Oh, yes, you do, Turbo.

658
00:46:21,048 --> 00:46:23,518
You, we, we had an
amazing time that time.

659
00:46:23,551 --> 00:46:26,120
- Can you stop calling me that?

660
00:46:30,224 --> 00:46:33,528
- Backup
ball and slipped.

661
00:46:40,702 --> 00:46:42,537
- I wanted to, um-

662
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:45,640
You okay?

663
00:46:45,674 --> 00:46:48,142
- Yeah, I'm fine.

664
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:51,879
- Yeah, I just, I
felt like I, I, I should, uh-

665
00:46:51,912 --> 00:46:53,548
- I...

666
00:46:53,581 --> 00:46:54,616
- What's happening?

667
00:46:54,649 --> 00:46:55,617
- I don't know.

668
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:57,552
I got stung or something.

669
00:46:57,585 --> 00:46:58,819
- What?

670
00:46:58,852 --> 00:47:00,622
Let me have a look.

671
00:47:00,655 --> 00:47:01,656
- God, no.

672
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:04,526
It's, it's down there, okay?

673
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:06,293
I-
- What do you mean down there?

674
00:47:06,327 --> 00:47:09,863
- I mean, I was peeing
and I don't know,

675
00:47:10,665 --> 00:47:12,600
something got in, up there.

676
00:47:12,634 --> 00:47:13,802
Whatever.

677
00:47:13,834 --> 00:47:15,637
- Oh, my God, is
it, is it burning?

678
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:17,672
Is it swollen?

679
00:47:17,706 --> 00:47:18,872
- I don't know, dad.

680
00:47:18,906 --> 00:47:20,441
I'm not gonna, I can't-

681
00:47:20,474 --> 00:47:22,142
- Well, what, you have to
have these things checked out

682
00:47:22,176 --> 00:47:23,877
because there's all kinds of,

683
00:47:23,911 --> 00:47:26,113
there, there could have been
a, like a poisonous insect

684
00:47:26,146 --> 00:47:28,248
or it could have been a snake.

685
00:47:28,282 --> 00:47:29,517
Did you see a snake?

686
00:47:29,551 --> 00:47:30,652
- Jesus Christ, dad.

687
00:47:30,685 --> 00:47:32,186
Stop freaking me out.

688
00:47:32,219 --> 00:47:34,689
- Well, did you see
something like a snake?

689
00:47:34,723 --> 00:47:35,724
How are you feeling?

690
00:47:35,757 --> 00:47:37,525
- I, I-
- Oh, my God.

691
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:39,927
- Like I'm gonna die now.
- Okay.

692
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:43,430
I'm gonna find us a,
um, a pharmacy, okay?

693
00:47:43,464 --> 00:47:45,199
Don't panic.

694
00:47:45,232 --> 00:47:47,034
- But don't pa, I wasn't until
you told me that there could,

695
00:47:47,067 --> 00:47:48,670
the poisonous stuff out there.

696
00:47:48,703 --> 00:47:50,170
- Well, there is
poisonous stuff out there.

697
00:47:50,204 --> 00:47:52,807
I'm sure it wasn't that,
but we can't be too careful.

698
00:47:52,841 --> 00:47:54,274
- Oh, am I gonna be okay?

699
00:47:54,308 --> 00:47:57,679
- Pharmacy near me.
- Am I gonna be okay?

700
00:47:57,712 --> 00:47:58,580
- Shoot.
- Dad.

701
00:47:58,613 --> 00:48:00,648
- Pharmacy near me.

702
00:48:00,682 --> 00:48:02,650
Oh, come on.
- Oh, god.

703
00:48:02,684 --> 00:48:04,586
- Pharmacy near me.

704
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:06,353
- This is how I go.
- Eight miles.

705
00:48:06,387 --> 00:48:07,254
- Dad, I, uh-

706
00:48:07,287 --> 00:48:08,422
- Okay, this is not how you go.

707
00:48:08,455 --> 00:48:09,624
Don't be silly.

708
00:48:13,828 --> 00:48:15,797
Okay.
- This looks closed.

709
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:16,997
- I know.

710
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:17,799
But there might
be someone inside.

711
00:48:17,832 --> 00:48:18,966
Let me see.

712
00:48:36,651 --> 00:48:39,486
- Fuck.

713
00:48:42,423 --> 00:48:43,257
- Shit.

714
00:48:54,301 --> 00:48:55,502
Fuck's sake.

715
00:48:56,871 --> 00:48:57,739
- Hi.

716
00:48:57,772 --> 00:48:58,673
- Oh, hi.

717
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:04,178
Do, do you know of
another pharmacy nearby?

718
00:49:04,211 --> 00:49:06,480
I need to get this one thing
for my daughter and this,

719
00:49:06,514 --> 00:49:09,183
this one's shut and
all of these seem shut.

720
00:49:09,216 --> 00:49:10,785
- No.

721
00:49:10,819 --> 00:49:11,619
No.

722
00:49:11,653 --> 00:49:12,854
Sorry.

723
00:49:12,887 --> 00:49:13,788
- Goddammit.

724
00:49:13,822 --> 00:49:14,988
- I don't.

725
00:49:15,022 --> 00:49:16,323
You're not from
around here, huh?

726
00:49:16,356 --> 00:49:17,191
- Uh, no.

727
00:49:18,526 --> 00:49:23,430
- Yeah, everything closes
around here at seven, sharp.

728
00:49:24,198 --> 00:49:25,600
Except for me.

729
00:49:25,633 --> 00:49:26,734
- What do you do after that?

730
00:49:26,768 --> 00:49:28,001
I mean, what if I,

731
00:49:28,035 --> 00:49:29,671
I just need this,
Look, this is shut.

732
00:49:29,704 --> 00:49:30,772
That's shut.

733
00:49:30,805 --> 00:49:31,806
This one's like nine miles away.

734
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,040
That's shut.

735
00:49:33,073 --> 00:49:35,042
- Like you seem stressed.

736
00:49:35,075 --> 00:49:36,811
- Well, I, I am stressed.

737
00:49:36,845 --> 00:49:39,179
- I could relax you.

738
00:49:40,782 --> 00:49:41,816
- Oh.

739
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:44,652
Um, no, that's not necessary.

740
00:49:44,686 --> 00:49:45,787
- Are you sure?

741
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:46,621
- Yeah.

742
00:49:46,654 --> 00:49:47,622
Yeah.

743
00:49:47,655 --> 00:49:48,523
- I can be really fun.

744
00:49:48,556 --> 00:49:50,023
- No, no, I'm sure.

745
00:49:50,057 --> 00:49:53,026
I just, I need, uh, I need
a doctor or a pharmacy.

746
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:55,062
So, that's what I'm looking for.

747
00:49:55,095 --> 00:49:56,497
Uh, good night.

748
00:49:56,531 --> 00:50:00,735
- Well, um, I'm no doctor,
but I can take a look.

749
00:50:06,139 --> 00:50:08,576
- Maybe you could have a look.

750
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:11,411
Uh, I would just need you
to look at my daughter's,

751
00:50:11,445 --> 00:50:12,747
um, her lady area.

752
00:50:15,115 --> 00:50:17,384
She had, she got bitten.

753
00:50:17,417 --> 00:50:18,051
- Oh.

754
00:50:18,085 --> 00:50:19,521
- By a something.

755
00:50:19,554 --> 00:50:20,922
It, we, she was peeing
at the side of the road

756
00:50:20,955 --> 00:50:22,256
and she got bitten
by I don't know

757
00:50:22,289 --> 00:50:24,024
if it was a snake or
a spi, that's my worry

758
00:50:24,057 --> 00:50:25,693
is that it was a snake and I-

759
00:50:25,727 --> 00:50:27,160
- Okay.

760
00:50:27,194 --> 00:50:30,330
- She won't let me look,
so if you would look.

761
00:50:33,902 --> 00:50:35,435
Hey, darling.

762
00:50:35,469 --> 00:50:40,374
Um, this kind lady's offered
to take a look at your bite.

763
00:50:44,946 --> 00:50:45,914
- What?

764
00:50:45,947 --> 00:50:46,748
No.

765
00:50:47,782 --> 00:50:50,852
- Well, it's, she's sort of
like a professional person.

766
00:50:50,885 --> 00:50:51,786
- Yeah, no.

767
00:50:55,924 --> 00:50:56,791
- Yeah.

768
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,929
Yeah, that's a spider bite.

769
00:51:00,962 --> 00:51:03,163
It's not too bad though.

770
00:51:04,364 --> 00:51:06,901
I would say it was either a
wolf spider or a tarantula.

771
00:51:06,935 --> 00:51:08,135
- Tarantula?

772
00:51:09,003 --> 00:51:10,304
- Relax.

773
00:51:10,337 --> 00:51:12,607
They get a worse rep
than is warranted for.

774
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,977
Contrary to public belief,
tarantula bites are not deadly.

775
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:18,445
It's more like a bee sting.

776
00:51:19,379 --> 00:51:22,917
- How do you know
all of this stuff?

777
00:51:22,951 --> 00:51:25,720
- Um, my dad was a park ranger.

778
00:51:26,754 --> 00:51:27,589
So-
- Oh.

779
00:51:28,656 --> 00:51:29,891
That's cool.

780
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:33,260
- I-
- Oh.

781
00:51:33,293 --> 00:51:34,094
Oh.

782
00:51:34,127 --> 00:51:35,462
- She's gonna be just fine.

783
00:51:35,495 --> 00:51:36,129
- Oh, great.

784
00:51:36,163 --> 00:51:37,065
Thank you so much.

785
00:51:37,097 --> 00:51:37,999
- Told her to ice it.

786
00:51:38,032 --> 00:51:38,833
- Right.

787
00:51:38,866 --> 00:51:39,667
Okay.

788
00:51:39,701 --> 00:51:41,101
- Yeah.

789
00:51:41,134 --> 00:51:41,970
No stranger to having my
pants down on the sides

790
00:51:42,003 --> 00:51:42,870
of these roads.

791
00:51:42,904 --> 00:51:44,839
Gotta be careful.

792
00:51:44,872 --> 00:51:46,975
- Uh, wh, what do I owe you?

793
00:51:47,008 --> 00:51:49,376
- Uh, you guys heading north?

794
00:51:57,785 --> 00:51:58,686
Ooh.

795
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:59,520
Pancakes.

796
00:52:00,922 --> 00:52:02,991
I love me some pancakes.

797
00:52:03,024 --> 00:52:04,424
- Help yourself.

798
00:52:04,458 --> 00:52:05,359
- Thank you.

799
00:52:05,392 --> 00:52:06,995
- So, do you live around here?

800
00:52:07,028 --> 00:52:08,362
- Uh, yeah.

801
00:52:08,395 --> 00:52:11,633
I was, lived here my
whole life pretty much.

802
00:52:11,666 --> 00:52:12,800
- Oh, really?

803
00:52:12,834 --> 00:52:14,035
- Mm-hmm.

804
00:52:14,068 --> 00:52:15,502
Mm.

805
00:52:15,536 --> 00:52:18,171
And I'm saving up
to move to New York.

806
00:52:18,205 --> 00:52:20,875
- What's in New York?

807
00:52:20,908 --> 00:52:22,944
- I'm gonna be on Broadway.

808
00:52:22,977 --> 00:52:24,646
- Cool.
- Mm-hmm.

809
00:52:24,679 --> 00:52:25,513
- Wow.

810
00:52:27,081 --> 00:52:28,281
- Yep.

811
00:52:28,315 --> 00:52:29,684
I got some plays
that I'm gonna sell,

812
00:52:29,717 --> 00:52:32,053
and then I'm gonna
be a famous actress.

813
00:52:32,086 --> 00:52:33,988
- That's so cool
you wrote a play.

814
00:52:34,022 --> 00:52:36,924
- Several plays, actually.

815
00:52:36,958 --> 00:52:38,059
- That's funny.

816
00:52:38,092 --> 00:52:39,027
- Are you in school?

817
00:52:39,894 --> 00:52:40,995
- Uh, no.

818
00:52:41,029 --> 00:52:43,296
No, I, I was, but not anymore.

819
00:52:44,032 --> 00:52:45,198
- Mm.

820
00:52:45,232 --> 00:52:47,769
I never really liked school.

821
00:52:49,871 --> 00:52:51,673
What did you study or-

822
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:54,374
- Uh, painting.

823
00:52:55,375 --> 00:52:56,878
- But what
kind of painting?

824
00:52:56,911 --> 00:52:59,080
- I mean, I don't, I just
don't really paint anymore.

825
00:52:59,113 --> 00:53:01,448
- She's an amazing artist.

826
00:53:01,481 --> 00:53:02,550
Amazing.

827
00:53:02,583 --> 00:53:03,951
- I was okay.

828
00:53:03,985 --> 00:53:04,952
- No, no.

829
00:53:04,986 --> 00:53:05,887
Look, let me show you.

830
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:06,788
- What are you doing?

831
00:53:06,821 --> 00:53:08,255
- I've got a, yeah.

832
00:53:08,288 --> 00:53:10,457
If you scroll through there.

833
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:12,593
You'll see that she's
really got a gift.

834
00:53:12,627 --> 00:53:14,227
- Oh, wow.
- Right?

835
00:53:15,563 --> 00:53:16,396
Beautiful.

836
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:19,701
- This, I like these.

837
00:53:19,734 --> 00:53:20,568
Oh.

838
00:53:20,601 --> 00:53:22,036
- That's all her.

839
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:22,870
- Goodness.

840
00:53:22,904 --> 00:53:23,905
Wow.
- Yeah.

841
00:53:25,073 --> 00:53:27,975
Unique.
- This is so cool.

842
00:53:28,009 --> 00:53:29,577
Dude, why did you stop?

843
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:30,912
Look at this one.

844
00:53:30,945 --> 00:53:32,479
- Mm.

845
00:53:32,513 --> 00:53:34,148
- As like the background of
one of my sets on Broadway.

846
00:53:35,616 --> 00:53:36,517
You got it.

847
00:53:36,551 --> 00:53:38,686
- You know?
- It's all yours.

848
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,856
And then, um, I'll have
you come on opening night,

849
00:53:41,889 --> 00:53:42,957
sit front row.

850
00:53:44,291 --> 00:53:46,728
They'll ask how did you,

851
00:53:46,761 --> 00:53:49,997
this incredible
playwright slash actress

852
00:53:50,031 --> 00:53:53,067
meet this phenomenal painter?

853
00:53:53,101 --> 00:53:54,501
I'll tell them that
I stared directly

854
00:53:54,535 --> 00:53:56,470
into your pussy years ago

855
00:53:56,504 --> 00:53:58,238
without ever even
knowing your name.

856
00:54:00,174 --> 00:54:03,945
Uh, oh, you know, can
you, right here is good.

857
00:54:04,912 --> 00:54:05,747
- Oh, really?

858
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:06,848
Okay.
- Yeah.

859
00:54:08,482 --> 00:54:09,083
Great.

860
00:54:09,117 --> 00:54:10,484
Thank you.

861
00:54:10,518 --> 00:54:11,219
- No, thank
you for your help.

862
00:54:11,251 --> 00:54:12,053
Thank you.

863
00:54:12,086 --> 00:54:13,521
- For the ride.

864
00:54:13,554 --> 00:54:16,323
And, um, you should get
some ice on that bite.

865
00:54:16,356 --> 00:54:18,391
- Yeah, will do.

866
00:54:18,425 --> 00:54:20,762
- I will see you
in New York City!

867
00:54:20,795 --> 00:54:22,096
- Okay.
- See ya there.

868
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:24,098
- Take care of yourself.

869
00:54:30,138 --> 00:54:33,007
- She
took the pumpkin.

870
00:55:57,525 --> 00:55:59,227
- You know back
there at the church,

871
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:01,461
when you were around
all the candles,

872
00:56:01,494 --> 00:56:03,430
I had this idea for a portrait.

873
00:56:03,463 --> 00:56:06,267
- I didn't know
you did portraits.

874
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:07,101
- I didn't.

875
00:56:08,336 --> 00:56:11,138
- Well, what was your idea?

876
00:56:11,172 --> 00:56:12,472
- You were just surrounded

877
00:56:12,506 --> 00:56:15,509
by all these strange
religious knick-knacks

878
00:56:15,543 --> 00:56:19,479
and you had this
really intense red glow

879
00:56:19,513 --> 00:56:23,416
from the candles reflecting
all over your face.

880
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:26,954
Just contrasting with this
really icy blue around you.

881
00:56:26,988 --> 00:56:28,322
- So, I look like a demon?

882
00:56:28,356 --> 00:56:31,826
- No.

883
00:56:31,859 --> 00:56:32,693
Happy.

884
00:56:34,095 --> 00:56:35,930
You just looked happy.

885
00:56:53,281 --> 00:56:55,182
Hey, look at the lighthouse.

886
00:57:01,188 --> 00:57:02,790
- Great.

887
00:57:03,991 --> 00:57:05,893
- All right.

888
00:57:22,143 --> 00:57:23,344
Oh, I'm gonna take a dip.

889
00:57:23,377 --> 00:57:24,578
- No, no, no.

890
00:57:24,612 --> 00:57:26,013
The, the pool area's
closed it said.

891
00:57:26,047 --> 00:57:29,216
- Yeah, well, the
temperature's perfect, so-

892
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:30,051
- Okay.

893
00:57:30,084 --> 00:57:31,819
Enjoy yourself.

894
00:57:31,852 --> 00:57:35,189
- What, are you afraid
of getting in trouble?

895
00:57:35,222 --> 00:57:36,223
- No, I'm just tired.

896
00:57:36,257 --> 00:57:37,358
I wanna go to the room.

897
00:57:37,391 --> 00:57:38,225
Do you want me to take your bag?

898
00:57:38,259 --> 00:57:39,226
- Yeah.

899
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:41,329
- Okay.

900
00:57:41,362 --> 00:57:43,197
Have a nice swim.

901
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:44,298
- Look at you.

902
00:57:44,332 --> 00:57:45,967
All grown up now.

903
00:57:46,901 --> 00:57:50,204
I remember you used
to be way more fun.

904
00:57:51,305 --> 00:57:52,673
- Oh, shut up.

905
00:58:18,132 --> 00:58:19,300
- And here we are at the game.

906
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:21,936
Who's team are you cheering for?

907
00:58:21,969 --> 00:58:22,803
- Our team!

908
00:58:22,837 --> 00:58:23,571
- Yes!

909
00:58:23,604 --> 00:58:24,472
And are they doing well?

910
00:58:24,505 --> 00:58:25,339
- Yeah.

911
00:58:25,373 --> 00:58:27,208
- Oh.

912
00:58:27,241 --> 00:58:28,242
- Ah.

913
00:58:28,275 --> 00:58:29,443
- Come on.

914
00:58:29,477 --> 00:58:30,511
- Come on.

915
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:40,254
- Whoa!
- Woo!

916
00:58:57,238 --> 00:58:58,372
Oh, my God.

917
00:58:58,406 --> 00:58:59,840
You scared the shit out of me.

918
00:58:59,874 --> 00:59:02,443
- Oh, my God, it is real nice.

919
00:59:02,476 --> 00:59:03,477
- I told you.

920
00:59:03,512 --> 00:59:04,311
- Oh, my God, what is that?

921
00:59:04,345 --> 00:59:05,312
- What?

922
00:59:05,346 --> 00:59:06,047
- Ah, there's a cockroach.

923
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:06,947
- Oh, no.

924
00:59:06,981 --> 00:59:07,748
No!
- It's okay.

925
00:59:07,782 --> 00:59:08,549
The chlorine will kill it.

926
00:59:08,582 --> 00:59:09,550
- No, no, ah!

927
00:59:09,583 --> 00:59:10,684
- Oh, my God.
- What?

928
00:59:10,718 --> 00:59:11,685
- It's in your hair.

929
00:59:13,988 --> 00:59:15,156
- Turbo!

930
00:59:17,058 --> 00:59:18,325
Turbo!

931
00:59:18,359 --> 00:59:19,994
- Turbo!
- Turbo!

932
00:59:21,362 --> 00:59:22,329
Turbo!

933
00:59:31,772 --> 00:59:35,476
- Stop it.

934
00:59:36,511 --> 00:59:38,212
- Excuse me.

935
00:59:38,245 --> 00:59:39,680
Can you not read?

936
00:59:40,414 --> 00:59:41,415
- Oh, sorry.

937
00:59:41,449 --> 00:59:42,583
- Sorry, sir.

938
00:59:44,085 --> 00:59:45,152
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

939
00:59:45,186 --> 00:59:46,454
We didn't see that.

940
00:59:46,487 --> 00:59:48,355
But we thought maybe, uh-

941
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:50,324
- Get out.

942
00:59:52,193 --> 00:59:54,161
This is a serious violation.

943
00:59:54,195 --> 00:59:55,129
- Sorry.

944
00:59:55,162 --> 00:59:56,297
- I'm sorry about that.

945
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:57,431
- Sorry, sir.
- Take your time.

946
00:59:57,465 --> 00:59:58,666
- Oh, we, we, we will get out.

947
00:59:58,699 --> 01:00:00,334
- We'll get out.

948
01:00:00,367 --> 01:00:01,368
- Yeah.

949
01:00:01,402 --> 01:00:04,638
- Sorry, sir.

950
01:00:19,086 --> 01:00:20,555
Whatcha doing?

951
01:00:20,589 --> 01:00:21,590
- Oh.

952
01:00:21,622 --> 01:00:23,057
Just looking for something.

953
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:25,192
How's your bite?

954
01:00:25,226 --> 01:00:26,193
- A little itchy.

955
01:00:26,227 --> 01:00:27,061
- Oh.

956
01:00:28,462 --> 01:00:29,463
Oh, I'll get you some ice.

957
01:00:29,497 --> 01:00:31,432
There's a machine outside.

958
01:00:31,465 --> 01:00:32,433
- Oh, yeah.

959
01:00:32,466 --> 01:00:33,501
- Okay.

960
01:00:33,535 --> 01:00:35,369
- Thanks.

961
01:03:00,347 --> 01:03:01,148
- Cute.

962
01:03:12,393 --> 01:03:13,227
- Hello?

963
01:03:14,428 --> 01:03:15,362
- Hi.
- Hi.

964
01:03:17,231 --> 01:03:18,432
- Uh-
- Hey.

965
01:03:18,465 --> 01:03:19,867
- Hi.

966
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:22,002
- S, uh, sorry, my,
uh, my dad ran out just

967
01:03:22,036 --> 01:03:24,405
to get some ice but, um,

968
01:03:24,438 --> 01:03:26,140
for, yeah.
- Oh, no problem.

969
01:03:26,173 --> 01:03:27,107
Yeah.

970
01:03:27,141 --> 01:03:28,610
Hi, hi.

971
01:03:28,643 --> 01:03:30,077
- Hi.

972
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:32,313
- So, you
made it to the motel?

973
01:03:32,346 --> 01:03:33,147
- Yep.

974
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:33,782
Yep.

975
01:03:33,814 --> 01:03:35,249
We, uh, we did.

976
01:03:35,949 --> 01:03:36,850
- Good.

977
01:03:36,884 --> 01:03:38,319
That's, that's great.

978
01:03:38,352 --> 01:03:40,755
I was just, I just wanted
to check and make sure.

979
01:03:40,789 --> 01:03:43,457
- I, I can get him to
call you right back.

980
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:44,291
- Oh, no.

981
01:03:44,325 --> 01:03:45,760
No need.

982
01:03:45,794 --> 01:03:48,797
I, I don't wanna interrupt
your time together.

983
01:03:48,829 --> 01:03:50,565
Um, so how are you?

984
01:03:51,666 --> 01:03:52,667
- I'm good.

985
01:03:52,701 --> 01:03:53,867
Um, I'm great.

986
01:03:53,901 --> 01:03:55,235
- Oh, great.

987
01:03:55,269 --> 01:03:56,170
Oh, good.

988
01:03:56,203 --> 01:03:58,939
I'm, I'm so glad to hear that.

989
01:03:58,972 --> 01:04:00,575
And how's the motel?

990
01:04:02,443 --> 01:04:03,712
- It's really nice.

991
01:04:03,745 --> 01:04:05,179
Um, really nice.
- Oh, good.

992
01:04:05,212 --> 01:04:07,615
- I mean, I, I, I wouldn't
shine a black light

993
01:04:07,649 --> 01:04:09,551
in here, but-
- Yeah.

994
01:04:09,584 --> 01:04:10,484
Yeah.

995
01:04:10,518 --> 01:04:12,119
Bet, better not.

996
01:04:12,152 --> 01:04:13,555
Yeah, no.

997
01:04:13,588 --> 01:04:18,025
Um, well, anyway, uh, I
just, I want to say, and I,

998
01:04:21,629 --> 01:04:24,733
I know it's not my place and I,

999
01:04:24,766 --> 01:04:27,034
I hope I'm not crossing a line

1000
01:04:27,067 --> 01:04:31,472
but I think it's very brave
of you going to rehab.

1001
01:04:40,648 --> 01:04:41,482
- Yeah.

1002
01:04:42,449 --> 01:04:43,450
Uh, totally.

1003
01:04:45,553 --> 01:04:46,954
- Yeah.

1004
01:04:46,987 --> 01:04:50,958
Um, I, I hope to finally
meet you afterwards, if,

1005
01:04:50,991 --> 01:04:54,562
if that's something
that you'd like.

1006
01:04:54,596 --> 01:04:55,429
- No, yeah.

1007
01:04:55,462 --> 01:04:56,463
Uh, after...

1008
01:04:59,534 --> 01:05:00,367
- Okay.

1009
01:05:00,401 --> 01:05:01,636
Well, good night.

1010
01:05:03,738 --> 01:05:04,639
- 'Night.

1011
01:05:24,425 --> 01:05:25,660
- Got your ice.

1012
01:05:27,194 --> 01:05:31,098
I couldn't remember if you
were, uh, a Reese's person

1013
01:05:31,131 --> 01:05:35,670
or a Snickers person, so I,
I got both and some chips.

1014
01:05:36,771 --> 01:05:37,672
Some Cokes.

1015
01:05:39,072 --> 01:05:40,941
You're gonna have to
wrap this ice in a towel,

1016
01:05:40,974 --> 01:05:44,813
though, before you, uh,
Are you in the bathroom?

1017
01:05:44,846 --> 01:05:45,680
You okay?

1018
01:05:49,183 --> 01:05:52,554
- I spoke
to your new wife.

1019
01:05:53,888 --> 01:05:55,623
- You spoke with her?

1020
01:05:56,624 --> 01:05:58,325
- Yep.

1021
01:05:58,358 --> 01:06:00,862
She wanted to tell me
how proud she was of me

1022
01:06:00,895 --> 01:06:02,597
for going to rehab.

1023
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:05,065
Wonder who she got that from?

1024
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:07,000
- Do you
wanna come out?

1025
01:06:07,034 --> 01:06:08,469
We can ta, uh, talk about it.

1026
01:06:08,502 --> 01:06:10,839
- I really didn't know
that your painter friend

1027
01:06:10,872 --> 01:06:12,674
also ran a rehab center.

1028
01:06:13,675 --> 01:06:15,577
- I was gonna,
uh, I tried to tell you.

1029
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:17,779
I, uh, uh, just come out.

1030
01:06:17,812 --> 01:06:22,550
I didn't know really how to
deal with all this, you know?

1031
01:06:22,584 --> 01:06:23,484
- Fuck.

1032
01:06:23,518 --> 01:06:24,619
I can't believe this.

1033
01:06:24,652 --> 01:06:26,153
What the fuck am I doing here?

1034
01:06:26,186 --> 01:06:27,755
- Look, when your mom called
me, she was so terrified,

1035
01:06:27,789 --> 01:06:29,356
and I was terrified, too.

1036
01:06:29,389 --> 01:06:31,826
- Oh, and you thought
you could just kidnap me?

1037
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:32,760
- No!

1038
01:06:32,794 --> 01:06:33,661
You're an addict.

1039
01:06:33,695 --> 01:06:34,662
- Oh, geez.

1040
01:06:34,696 --> 01:06:36,731
Don't put your shit on me.

1041
01:06:36,764 --> 01:06:37,765
Okay?

1042
01:06:37,799 --> 01:06:39,199
I'm not like you, dad.

1043
01:06:39,233 --> 01:06:40,735
Everybody does drugs.

1044
01:06:40,768 --> 01:06:42,302
Everybody drinks.

1045
01:06:42,336 --> 01:06:44,037
- Not everybody OD's at six
in the morning and wakes up

1046
01:06:44,071 --> 01:06:45,239
in a hospital!

1047
01:06:45,272 --> 01:06:47,642
- Oh, so I make
one little mistake

1048
01:06:47,675 --> 01:06:48,910
and all of a sudden, what,

1049
01:06:48,943 --> 01:06:50,344
you think you can
be my parent again?

1050
01:06:50,377 --> 01:06:51,513
- No, you don't get to
call it a little mistake.

1051
01:06:51,546 --> 01:06:52,747
A little mistake is like

1052
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:53,748
not setting your
alarm or something.

1053
01:06:53,781 --> 01:06:55,382
Your heart stopped!

1054
01:06:56,951 --> 01:06:58,485
You almost died!

1055
01:07:06,794 --> 01:07:08,897
- And so
what if I did, huh?

1056
01:07:08,930 --> 01:07:10,163
What do you care?

1057
01:07:10,197 --> 01:07:11,431
You've never cared!

1058
01:07:11,465 --> 01:07:12,232
Mom doesn't care!

1059
01:07:12,266 --> 01:07:13,935
I don't fucking care.

1060
01:07:13,968 --> 01:07:15,803
- What are you talking about?

1061
01:07:15,837 --> 01:07:17,104
Well, of course we care.

1062
01:07:17,137 --> 01:07:18,806
What do you mean?

1063
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:20,909
I care for you more
than I can even a,

1064
01:07:20,942 --> 01:07:23,778
I care more than I can
even express to you.

1065
01:07:23,811 --> 01:07:24,646
I ca...

1066
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:27,849
And when we when my
little boy was born,

1067
01:07:27,882 --> 01:07:29,584
all I wanted was
for him to know you!

1068
01:07:29,617 --> 01:07:33,588
So, you could do things together
and, and protect each other

1069
01:07:33,621 --> 01:07:36,256
and be there for each other
and experience life together.

1070
01:07:36,290 --> 01:07:38,425
- Oh, my God, of course.

1071
01:07:38,458 --> 01:07:39,727
- What?

1072
01:07:39,761 --> 01:07:41,228
- Your new fucking baby,
your new fucking life,

1073
01:07:41,261 --> 01:07:43,631
your new fucking wife.

1074
01:07:43,665 --> 01:07:45,198
- Look, all right, the, uh-

1075
01:07:45,232 --> 01:07:48,836
- No, you're just
a phony fuck, okay?

1076
01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:50,070
I don't know you.

1077
01:07:50,103 --> 01:07:51,606
I don't want to know you.

1078
01:07:51,639 --> 01:07:52,540
- Okay, let's calm down.

1079
01:07:52,574 --> 01:07:53,875
Calm down.
- No.

1080
01:07:53,908 --> 01:07:55,677
- Now let's calm down.
- I, calm down?

1081
01:07:55,710 --> 01:07:58,345
What, all of a sudden you
get to tell me to calm down

1082
01:07:58,378 --> 01:08:00,682
'cause you're some,
my parent again?

1083
01:08:00,715 --> 01:08:01,916
You're not my parent.

1084
01:08:01,950 --> 01:08:04,217
You've never been
there for me, dad.

1085
01:08:04,251 --> 01:08:06,486
You fucking left.

1086
01:08:06,521 --> 01:08:07,522
You left me!

1087
01:08:08,656 --> 01:08:10,058
You left us, okay?

1088
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:12,292
You made that decision!

1089
01:08:12,326 --> 01:08:14,394
And now you're trying
to make it all nice

1090
01:08:14,428 --> 01:08:18,131
for your new fucking wife
and your new fucking baby,

1091
01:08:18,165 --> 01:08:22,235
so and hopes the baby she
doesn't see what a fucking,

1092
01:08:22,269 --> 01:08:24,672
fucking piece of
shit you really are!

1093
01:08:24,706 --> 01:08:25,707
- That's not fair.

1094
01:08:25,740 --> 01:08:27,107
- Oh, it's not fair, is it?

1095
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:28,042
- Oh, what,
are you gonna joke

1096
01:08:28,076 --> 01:08:28,876
your way out of this?

1097
01:08:28,910 --> 01:08:29,877
- No!

1098
01:08:29,911 --> 01:08:31,144
You're a fucking asshole!

1099
01:08:31,178 --> 01:08:32,179
- And you're trying
to kill yourself!

1100
01:08:32,212 --> 01:08:33,615
You're gonna kill yourself!

1101
01:08:33,648 --> 01:08:35,850
- Guess who I fucking
learned that from?

1102
01:08:35,883 --> 01:08:37,552
- Oh, fuck's sake.

1103
01:08:37,585 --> 01:08:38,987
- Oh, yeah.

1104
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:39,921
No, it's too much for
you now, isn't it?

1105
01:08:39,954 --> 01:08:41,089
- Yeah.

1106
01:08:41,121 --> 01:08:42,023
- Yeah, just fucking go-
- Okay.

1107
01:08:42,056 --> 01:08:42,991
- Like you always do.

1108
01:08:43,024 --> 01:08:46,060
Just fucking go.

1109
01:08:46,094 --> 01:08:48,563
Like you always fucking do.

1110
01:08:49,296 --> 01:08:52,767
What the fuck?

1111
01:09:19,259 --> 01:09:20,762
- I was
just messing around.

1112
01:09:20,795 --> 01:09:22,195
This guy went crazy though.

1113
01:09:22,229 --> 01:09:23,463
- What
happened to your face?

1114
01:09:23,497 --> 01:09:24,999
- Yeah, yeah, he
kicked off of me.

1115
01:09:25,033 --> 01:09:27,568
Don't you think it's kinda cute?

1116
01:09:27,602 --> 01:09:28,335
- No.

1117
01:09:28,368 --> 01:09:30,203
What is wrong with you?

1118
01:09:30,237 --> 01:09:31,639
What's wrong with you.

1119
01:09:31,673 --> 01:09:32,940
You can't say you
want to stop drinking

1120
01:09:32,974 --> 01:09:35,242
if you're going out every night.

1121
01:09:48,990 --> 01:09:50,925
- Hey, Turbo.

1122
01:10:05,205 --> 01:10:07,108
- She didn't know.

1123
01:10:07,141 --> 01:10:08,341
What the hell?

1124
01:10:08,375 --> 01:10:09,577
- Oh, shit.

1125
01:10:09,610 --> 01:10:10,545
Oh, my God.

1126
01:10:10,578 --> 01:10:11,478
I am so sorry.

1127
01:10:11,512 --> 01:10:13,114
- No, it, it's not your fault.

1128
01:10:13,147 --> 01:10:14,682
I should have, um, well,
I should have told her.

1129
01:10:14,716 --> 01:10:16,150
I should have told her.

1130
01:10:16,184 --> 01:10:17,417
- Okay, well,
what, what's going on now?

1131
01:10:17,451 --> 01:10:19,053
What's, what's happening?

1132
01:10:19,087 --> 01:10:21,055
- She's so angry
with me and I, uh,

1133
01:10:21,089 --> 01:10:22,623
I can't even speak to her.

1134
01:10:22,657 --> 01:10:24,224
Like I, uh, now I know what
I would liked to have said,

1135
01:10:24,257 --> 01:10:26,259
but in the moment,
I'm just like I get,

1136
01:10:26,293 --> 01:10:29,530
get frozen and I can't
think of what to say and I-

1137
01:10:29,564 --> 01:10:31,099
- Yeah, of course.

1138
01:10:31,132 --> 01:10:32,567
She's gonna be angry.

1139
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:33,366
Okay?

1140
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,802
She's gonna push back.

1141
01:10:34,836 --> 01:10:37,171
She's struggling with
serious addiction.

1142
01:10:37,205 --> 01:10:38,873
- Yeah, I know, but
it's more than that.

1143
01:10:38,906 --> 01:10:40,808
Like I haven't, I haven't,
uh, I haven't seen her

1144
01:10:40,842 --> 01:10:43,811
or spoken to her in ages, and
she thinks it's because I,

1145
01:10:43,845 --> 01:10:47,915
uh, I don't try or
that I didn't want to.

1146
01:10:47,949 --> 01:10:49,984
And well, maybe I didn't.

1147
01:10:55,422 --> 01:10:56,758
- I understand.

1148
01:10:56,791 --> 01:10:58,126
I understand.

1149
01:10:58,159 --> 01:10:59,927
- I know, but I don't
think you really know

1150
01:10:59,961 --> 01:11:02,930
what it was li, what I was like.

1151
01:11:02,964 --> 01:11:04,532
It was, I was bad.

1152
01:11:04,565 --> 01:11:08,002
I was like a terrible father
and, uh, spending time

1153
01:11:08,035 --> 01:11:10,805
with her now is just bringing
it all back, you know,

1154
01:11:10,838 --> 01:11:12,006
and I, I hate it.

1155
01:11:12,039 --> 01:11:14,407
I fucking hate who I was then.

1156
01:11:14,441 --> 01:11:17,044
- Yeah, you're
not that person anymore.

1157
01:11:17,078 --> 01:11:18,478
You're not.

1158
01:11:18,513 --> 01:11:22,049
- I know, but she, she
thinks that I am.

1159
01:12:35,790 --> 01:12:36,624
Shit.

1160
01:12:42,296 --> 01:12:46,433
- Come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on.

1161
01:12:46,466 --> 01:12:48,736
Come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on.

1162
01:12:48,769 --> 01:12:49,604
Come on.

1163
01:12:52,173 --> 01:12:53,574
Fuck.

1164
01:13:46,527 --> 01:13:47,962
Hey man, sorry.

1165
01:13:49,630 --> 01:13:53,000
Um, uh, I'm ju, just
wondering if, um,

1166
01:13:55,736 --> 01:13:58,706
do you know where
I can get high?

1167
01:14:37,111 --> 01:14:40,314
- Um, I didn't know
girls still got into cars

1168
01:14:40,348 --> 01:14:41,983
with with strangers.

1169
01:14:42,016 --> 01:14:46,253
I'm not strange, but, you
know, you know what I'm saying.

1170
01:14:46,287 --> 01:14:47,221
Um...

1171
01:14:58,332 --> 01:14:59,734
- Oh, excuse me.

1172
01:14:59,767 --> 01:15:01,402
Did a young girl, a girl
or a woman come in here?

1173
01:15:01,435 --> 01:15:03,437
Probably about five
eight, brown hair.

1174
01:15:03,471 --> 01:15:04,605
She's 20 years old.

1175
01:15:04,638 --> 01:15:06,707
She's wearing a,
a brown sweater.

1176
01:15:06,741 --> 01:15:08,209
- I wish.

1177
01:15:08,242 --> 01:15:09,276
- Okay, thanks.

1178
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:20,988
- Yeah, it's been a while.

1179
01:15:21,022 --> 01:15:24,959
Like, I'm just, I just get
sort of like scratchy eyes

1180
01:15:24,992 --> 01:15:27,595
and like a runny nose
and then you see hives.

1181
01:15:27,628 --> 01:15:30,097
I don't know, I just fear
it's worsening, you know,

1182
01:15:30,131 --> 01:15:34,535
'cause like cats, they're
just fucking adorable.

1183
01:15:41,275 --> 01:15:42,610
Yeah.

1184
01:15:42,643 --> 01:15:45,379
Um, uh, you can just,
no, you, uh, you wait,

1185
01:15:45,413 --> 01:15:47,281
wait here for a second.

1186
01:16:25,119 --> 01:16:25,953
Fuck.

1187
01:16:28,956 --> 01:16:33,427
Rain, rain, go away,
right?

1188
01:16:33,461 --> 01:16:34,862
Ah, ladies first.

1189
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:47,074
Ooh.

1190
01:16:50,344 --> 01:16:51,580
Hey.

1191
01:16:51,612 --> 01:16:54,615
You, um, you sit on
whatever you want.

1192
01:16:59,086 --> 01:17:00,754
- I ask you to get some
milk and cigarettes,

1193
01:17:00,788 --> 01:17:04,158
and you bring back
a whole ass girl.

1194
01:17:04,191 --> 01:17:05,359
- I'm an over-achiever.

1195
01:17:05,392 --> 01:17:07,161
- You want a soda?

1196
01:17:07,194 --> 01:17:08,129
- Uh, sure.

1197
01:17:13,535 --> 01:17:16,470
- So, what do you want?
- Oh, whoa, hey.

1198
01:17:16,504 --> 01:17:20,141
Um, baby, um, where
are your manners?

1199
01:17:20,174 --> 01:17:21,242
She, she's our guest.

1200
01:17:21,275 --> 01:17:22,476
She just got here.

1201
01:17:22,511 --> 01:17:25,146
Let's, let's have
our manner hat on.

1202
01:17:28,449 --> 01:17:29,817
- I was just making
sure she knows

1203
01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:31,586
she's not getting any freebies.

1204
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:33,522
- She's not getting
any freebies.

1205
01:17:33,555 --> 01:17:34,556
- Okay.

1206
01:17:34,589 --> 01:17:35,524
- She knows.

1207
01:17:35,557 --> 01:17:36,857
- Okay.

1208
01:17:36,891 --> 01:17:38,425
- Now, why don't you
be a good little girl

1209
01:17:38,459 --> 01:17:39,693
and get that globe?

1210
01:17:39,727 --> 01:17:41,328
- What
am I, the butler?

1211
01:17:41,362 --> 01:17:42,196
Hmm?

1212
01:17:42,229 --> 01:17:43,397
- Just get it.

1213
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:49,203
She's not
always such a cunt.

1214
01:17:49,236 --> 01:17:51,071
- Oh, it's, it's okay.

1215
01:17:52,641 --> 01:17:54,408
- Um, you like music?

1216
01:17:58,513 --> 01:17:59,313
- Yeah.

1217
01:17:59,346 --> 01:18:00,181
- Yeah.

1218
01:18:07,589 --> 01:18:10,525
- So,
where are you from?

1219
01:18:10,559 --> 01:18:12,092
- Uh, San Diego.

1220
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:14,228
- I see you.

1221
01:18:14,261 --> 01:18:16,565
And, um, they don't tell
girls in San Diego not

1222
01:18:16,598 --> 01:18:18,399
to get in cars with strangers?

1223
01:18:18,432 --> 01:18:19,733
- That's what I said.

1224
01:18:19,767 --> 01:18:22,236
Fuckin' great minds.

1225
01:18:22,269 --> 01:18:23,737
Um, yeah, she's lucky.

1226
01:18:23,771 --> 01:18:27,374
She could've ended up
with a real weirdo.

1227
01:18:35,182 --> 01:18:36,450
- Um, what is it?

1228
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:41,222
- I don't know!

1229
01:18:42,591 --> 01:18:44,291
- Is it coke?

1230
01:18:44,325 --> 01:18:45,594
- You tell me.

1231
01:18:45,627 --> 01:18:46,827
Yeah, yes.

1232
01:19:01,576 --> 01:19:03,277
- Well, don't hog it all, babe.

1233
01:19:03,310 --> 01:19:04,144
Come on.

1234
01:19:07,515 --> 01:19:08,516
Woo!

1235
01:19:08,550 --> 01:19:09,618
Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

1236
01:19:09,651 --> 01:19:10,484
Oh, yeah.

1237
01:19:11,952 --> 01:19:14,321
Put some pep in that step.

1238
01:19:15,690 --> 01:19:17,758
- Come dance with me.
- Oh, no.

1239
01:19:17,791 --> 01:19:20,427
I'm, I'm good.
- Oh, come on.

1240
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:28,168
- Hey, you think I
can get another one?

1241
01:19:28,202 --> 01:19:29,336
- Oh.

1242
01:19:29,370 --> 01:19:30,971
I knew I liked you.

1243
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:46,621
- I'm sorry everyone.

1244
01:19:46,655 --> 01:19:47,855
I'm sorry to bother you.

1245
01:19:47,888 --> 01:19:48,856
I'm just trying to
find my daughter.

1246
01:19:48,889 --> 01:19:50,991
We, we became, uh,

1247
01:19:51,025 --> 01:19:52,893
I wondered if maybe she
came in here earlier.

1248
01:19:52,926 --> 01:19:54,562
She's 20 years old.

1249
01:19:54,596 --> 01:19:55,630
She's got brown hair.

1250
01:19:55,664 --> 01:19:56,598
About this high.

1251
01:19:56,631 --> 01:19:57,699
She's a sweet girl.

1252
01:19:57,732 --> 01:19:59,601
She's quite, she's quite funny.

1253
01:19:59,634 --> 01:20:01,869
Does anyone seen her in here?

1254
01:20:01,902 --> 01:20:03,672
She might be a bit upset.

1255
01:20:03,705 --> 01:20:04,539
Uh, no?

1256
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:06,641
She might have come in here.

1257
01:20:06,675 --> 01:20:08,475
We had a bit of a argument,

1258
01:20:08,510 --> 01:20:11,278
but, do you think she
maybe came in earlier.

1259
01:21:09,937 --> 01:21:10,904
- Hey.

1260
01:21:10,938 --> 01:21:13,675
So where are you staying?

1261
01:21:13,708 --> 01:21:15,075
- Huh?

1262
01:21:15,109 --> 01:21:17,478
- Would you shut up?

1263
01:21:17,512 --> 01:21:18,345
Be nice.

1264
01:21:19,213 --> 01:21:20,981
- I'm just saying.

1265
01:21:21,014 --> 01:21:24,218
We haven't even seen one
dollar or heard one thank you.

1266
01:21:24,251 --> 01:21:25,252
- Thank you.

1267
01:21:26,387 --> 01:21:27,888
- She's gonna pay.

1268
01:21:29,824 --> 01:21:31,358
She's gonna pay.

1269
01:21:33,293 --> 01:21:33,961
She's gonna pay.

1270
01:21:33,994 --> 01:21:35,764
Isn't that right?

1271
01:21:35,797 --> 01:21:39,099
- Do you have a
bathroom I could use?

1272
01:22:10,832 --> 01:22:11,666
Oh shit.

1273
01:22:43,832 --> 01:22:45,365
- Hell no.

1274
01:22:46,433 --> 01:22:49,704
Nah, you ain't
getting off that easy.

1275
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:54,274
Oh, for fuck's sake.

1276
01:22:59,514 --> 01:23:00,715
- You'll be fine.

1277
01:23:05,419 --> 01:23:06,353
- Oh.

1278
01:23:08,790 --> 01:23:09,924
Cash, grass, or ass.

1279
01:23:09,958 --> 01:23:11,992
No one rides for free.

1280
01:23:16,865 --> 01:23:18,666
- Have a nice day.
- Bye.

1281
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:19,534
- Go on.

1282
01:24:19,027 --> 01:24:19,827
- Hello?

1283
01:24:19,861 --> 01:24:20,862
Honey!

1284
01:24:20,895 --> 01:24:21,896
Hello?

1285
01:24:21,930 --> 01:24:22,797
Hello?

1286
01:24:23,831 --> 01:24:24,632
Okay.

1287
01:24:24,666 --> 01:24:25,733
Oh.

1288
01:24:25,767 --> 01:24:27,635
Oh, thank goodness you're alive.

1289
01:24:38,746 --> 01:24:40,014
- What's wrong with her?

1290
01:24:40,048 --> 01:24:41,415
- Psst, mm-mm.

1291
01:24:43,885 --> 01:24:46,486
How did you get there, honey?

1292
01:24:48,923 --> 01:24:51,391
Do you know what day it is?

1293
01:24:52,492 --> 01:24:53,695
Oh, dear.

1294
01:24:53,728 --> 01:24:56,864
what, maybe we should
call an ambulance.

1295
01:24:56,898 --> 01:24:57,966
- No, no.

1296
01:24:57,999 --> 01:25:00,267
No, please don't do that.

1297
01:25:01,736 --> 01:25:06,841
I, I was camping and I, I went
to pee and I think I fell.

1298
01:25:13,180 --> 01:25:15,950
- You sure there
isn't anybody we can call?

1299
01:25:15,984 --> 01:25:17,451
Maybe your mom?

1300
01:25:25,627 --> 01:25:26,527
Pretty fun.

1301
01:25:27,762 --> 01:25:29,129
What do you think?

1302
01:25:29,162 --> 01:25:31,164
Come on, not last in space.

1303
01:25:31,198 --> 01:25:32,265
- Mom?
- Are you okay?

1304
01:25:32,299 --> 01:25:33,166
Your dad called me.

1305
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:34,002
Where are you now?

1306
01:25:34,035 --> 01:25:35,036
- Yeah.

1307
01:25:35,069 --> 01:25:35,937
I'm okay.

1308
01:25:35,970 --> 01:25:37,105
I'm physically okay.

1309
01:25:37,404 --> 01:25:40,541
I just, um, I, I just
lost, I just went

1310
01:25:41,809 --> 01:25:45,345
for a walk after our fight
and couldn't find my key

1311
01:25:45,379 --> 01:25:47,048
so I slept by, by the pool.

1312
01:25:47,081 --> 01:25:49,050
I'm just borrowing someone's
phone who's staying

1313
01:25:49,083 --> 01:25:50,183
at the motel.

1314
01:25:51,953 --> 01:25:53,387
I'm, I'm really okay.

1315
01:25:53,420 --> 01:25:57,558
I just, Mom, I just want,
I just wanna come home.

1316
01:26:00,695 --> 01:26:05,900
I know I fucked
up, okay, but please.

1317
01:26:09,804 --> 01:26:11,171
Mom, say something.

1318
01:26:11,204 --> 01:26:12,907
- You need
to talk to your dad.

1319
01:26:12,940 --> 01:26:14,942
- You're such a hypocrite.

1320
01:26:14,976 --> 01:26:16,410
- Because-
- You know, I don't get it.

1321
01:26:16,443 --> 01:26:18,345
I don't get why you
still want him around

1322
01:26:18,378 --> 01:26:20,114
after everything
he's put us through.

1323
01:26:20,148 --> 01:26:22,116
After, after everything
he's done to you,

1324
01:26:22,150 --> 01:26:24,284
why don't you hate him?

1325
01:26:48,509 --> 01:26:49,342
- Hello?

1326
01:26:50,310 --> 01:26:51,946
- Dad?

1327
01:28:59,774 --> 01:29:01,175
- What are we doing?

1328
01:29:01,209 --> 01:29:04,979
- Well, I just assumed
you'd need to pee.

1329
01:30:17,852 --> 01:30:22,623
Turbo, don't be too embarrassed
by your old dad's diary.

1330
01:30:23,958 --> 01:30:25,159
You are like me,

1331
01:30:30,197 --> 01:30:31,165
but better.

1332
01:30:36,370 --> 01:30:38,039
But I love you more.

1333
01:30:40,741 --> 01:30:41,542
Dad.

1334
01:32:25,379 --> 01:32:26,180
Here.

1335
01:32:29,483 --> 01:32:30,317
Okay.

1336
01:32:42,363 --> 01:32:44,198
That's it.

1337
01:32:44,231 --> 01:32:45,566
Yeah, you got it.

1338
01:32:45,599 --> 01:32:48,369
Just now put your arm
up on the, that's it.

1339
01:32:48,402 --> 01:32:50,404
Slouch down a bit.

1340
01:32:50,438 --> 01:32:51,439
Yeah.

1341
01:32:51,472 --> 01:32:53,307
Now you're looking cool.

1342
01:32:58,513 --> 01:32:59,580
- Yeah.

1343
01:33:01,148 --> 01:33:02,483
- Love this one.

1344
01:33:14,895 --> 01:33:15,596
- Okay.

1345
01:33:25,540 --> 01:33:28,042
- So, where are we headed?

1346
01:33:28,075 --> 01:33:29,343
- What do you mean?

1347
01:33:29,376 --> 01:33:31,879
- Well, you're the driver now.

1348
01:33:32,713 --> 01:33:34,081
- Yeah, right.

1349
01:33:35,282 --> 01:33:37,818
- Yeah, where do you wanna go?

1350
01:33:37,852 --> 01:33:42,289
- I feel like
this is some kind of trap.

1351
01:33:44,158 --> 01:33:45,926
- It's your decision.

1352
01:33:47,562 --> 01:33:50,231
You can turn 'round and go home.

1353
01:33:51,198 --> 01:33:52,867
We can do that or...

1354
01:35:01,268 --> 01:35:06,006
- Um, do you have to
sign me in or something?

1355
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:06,740
- No.

1356
01:35:06,774 --> 01:35:08,042
It's all you.

1357
01:35:09,710 --> 01:35:11,412
- Okay.

1358
01:35:11,445 --> 01:35:12,279
- Okay.

1359
01:35:13,113 --> 01:35:15,182
- I'll see you in a few weeks.

1360
01:35:15,216 --> 01:35:16,450
- Yeah, you will.

1361
01:35:19,521 --> 01:35:22,122
I...

1362
01:35:24,758 --> 01:35:25,793
- I know.

1363
01:35:49,183 --> 01:35:50,484
- Hi.

1364
01:35:51,519 --> 01:35:53,220
Welcome.

1365
01:35:53,254 --> 01:35:56,257
And Congrats on the first step
to your journey of recovery.

1366
01:35:56,290 --> 01:35:57,726
You've already done
the hardest part,

1367
01:35:57,758 --> 01:35:59,561
which is walking
through the door.

1368
01:35:59,594 --> 01:36:00,961
You should be so
proud of yourself.

1369
01:42:03,524 --> 01:42:08,730
- Come on.
