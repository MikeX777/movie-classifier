1
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:31,452
- A drink while you're waiting,
ma'am?

2
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:35,589
- Uh, I'm... I'm fine for now.
- Certainly.

3
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:49,110
- Did you pull the horns down?
- Yeah, yeah.

4
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,909
- Can you put it in the...
Can you, uh, go back

5
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:55,247
and just play it
with the foley next to it?

6
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,713
Well, that's going to have
to wait till Tuesday. No.

7
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:36,691
But, you know what, just
email me. Yeah, email me...

8
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:38,818
Okay.

9
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,234
- Just right there.
- Okay.

10
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:06,353
I am so sorry.

11
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:09,722
Oh, shit. I gotta get this.
- Uh-huh.

12
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,658
- Yeah...

13
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:14,128
No, the dark one...

14
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,326
Because the show is sunny enough already.
It doesn't need the sunny theme...

15
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:21,667
It's too twee-twee. It's like
butterflies and rainbows... I...

16
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:24,138
The dark one...

17
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,971
It's not that dark...

18
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,308
It's not a dirge...
Okay...

19
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,642
Good...

20
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,274
Yes.

21
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:37,513
This is going on vibrate
right now.

22
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:43,686
I've been working as a music adviser
for Lifetime in LA, and,

23
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:45,762
they want to rebrand
the Canadian version,

24
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:47,887
so I convinced them
to send me here for a few days.

25
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:50,490
I could have done the work online,

26
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,297
but this way I get the hotel
and the flight paid for.

27
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:55,167
You know how it is.

28
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,605
- Not really.

29
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,472
- Anyway, I'm sorry I was late.
I know you hate waiting.

30
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,138
We said 6:30, right?
- Six o'clock.

31
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:08,412
- Oh, you waited 45 minutes?
- I was early.

32
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,316
- How early?

33
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:13,890
- It doesn't matter.
About 15 minutes.

34
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:17,517
- No. You waited an hour?

35
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,527
Something's changed.

36
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,531
Back in the day, you wouldn't
have waited an hour for anyone.

37
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,464
Except maybe your dealer.

38
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,461
Aw, give me a hug.

39
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,712
You look terrific.
- You look terrible.

40
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,756
- No, I don't.

41
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,620
- And I don't look terrific.

42
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,756
- How are you?
- Ah-ha.

43
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:54,091
- Oh, I'm afraid I forgot.
You hate that question.

44
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:59,027
- Do you want me to ask
how you are?

45
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:01,705
- Only if you're interested.

46
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:03,933
- How are you?

47
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:06,742
- Good.

48
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,277
Busy.

49
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:10,804
Tired.

50
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,242
Hungry.
You took a look at the menu?

51
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,751
- I had a chance, yeah.

52
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,446
- Plus, they'll do up something
special for you if you want.

53
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,216
I came here a lot the last time
I was in town

54
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:21,848
and I got to know the chef.

55
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:26,959
- Can I get you a drink?

56
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:29,896
- Uh, a drink...
What do you think?

57
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:31,797
- You drinking?

58
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:34,200
- Um,you?

59
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,068
- No, you?

60
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:39,233
- No, but...
- But?

61
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:43,905
- No. Um, San Pellegrino,
big bottle, lime on the side.

62
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:45,913
Is your lime fresh?
- Oh, yes.

63
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:49,611
- Okay, lime on the side,
no ice. Thanks.

64
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:53,053
Are you ready to order?
- Sure.

65
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:55,557
- Um, is Henry in the kitchen?

66
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,217
- Oh, Henry's not here any more.

67
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,853
- Oh, no. Where's Henry?
- He went to Ultra.

68
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,795
- Ugh. We should have gone to Ultra.

69
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,832
- But Denise is here
and she mentored under him.

70
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:06,334
- Do you still do that quail?
- Yes.

71
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:09,906
- Great. I'll have the quail,
no starch. Um, organic greens.

72
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:13,067
- Sure.
And, um, you?

73
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,873
- What's this?

74
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:18,573
- It's the potato soup.
It's very delicious.

75
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:20,684
- Just a salad.

76
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,753
- We... we have a selection
of salads.

77
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:26,550
- Number one.
And we can do without this.

78
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,627
- So, this thing tonight...

79
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:38,463
- Ah, how embarrassing.
- Yeah, I know.

80
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,662
- "Women in Rock"...

81
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,103
Why not "Women in Labour"?

82
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,209
Are they doing
a bake sale, too?

83
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:47,140
- It's a tribute.

84
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,872
- To who?
- To us, for one.

85
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:51,777
And it's a benefit.

86
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:56,319
- Are they giving out medals?
I'd rather have the cash.

87
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,444
- They want us to do something.

88
00:07:58,578 --> 00:07:59,886
- Uh-huh.
- They'd like us

89
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:03,391
to do something. I mean,
I'm not prepared to do anything.

90
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,393
- I'm not sure I'm going.

91
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:08,328
- But you have to go.
- No, I don't.

92
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,924
- Well, uh...

93
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:14,038
You have to at least go. I mean,
we don't have to do something.

94
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,400
- I'm not doing anything.

95
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:18,134
- But you have to go.
- No, I don't.

96
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:23,077
- No... true... No, you don't have to.
It would be nice, though.

97
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:25,580
- Nice for who?

98
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,412
- Okay, fine.

99
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,213
It's just, you know, I'm...

100
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,186
It's happening,
and I'm here, and...

101
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:35,315
- You're here because
you're working, I thought.

102
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:39,419
- No. I mean, yes, but I planned
the work around tonight.

103
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:42,590
I'm here for tonight.
- That's nice.

104
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:45,498
- I could have done
this work at home.

105
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:46,831
- Home.

106
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,408
- What?
- LA is home now?

107
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,205
- Uh, well, yeah,
as much as LA can be.

108
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,711
- You and LA.

109
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,611
- Silver Lake is nice.

110
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,684
Malibu.

111
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,981
- You doing any modeling
these days?

112
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:08,623
- It wasn't modeling.

113
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:10,227
- Well, what would you call

114
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:12,625
having you picture taken
in a magazine to sell clothes?

115
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,561
- I wasn't selling clothes.

116
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,689
- Well, you weren't wearing
much clothing, that's true.

117
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:18,824
- It's ancient history.

118
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:23,397
You know, it was fun,
what I remember of it.

119
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:25,839
I was drunk most of the time.

120
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,605
I can't believe you're still
carrying that around.

121
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,273
- I'm not carrying anything around.

122
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,511
I'm just catching up.

123
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,490
- So, what are you up to?

124
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:45,527
- Not much.

125
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,356
- You're good though, right?
I'm hearing you're good.

126
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:50,194
- Where are you hearing that?
- From Bill.

127
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,893
- That asshole.

128
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:53,765
- He says you're in touch.

129
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,930
- He still wants to manage me.

130
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:58,668
I have nothing to manage
but my cat and my laundry.

131
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,176
- He likes Florida.

132
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,509
- He's fucking golfing.
Can you believe that?

133
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,810
- He says
you're making new music.

134
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,941
- That's Bill's Story.

135
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,213
- You're not?

136
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:14,189
- Well, it's not new.
What's new? Nothing's new.

137
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:16,623
- It's acoustic, he said.

138
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,526
You were always talking
about doing that.

139
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,098
I'd love to hear it.
Do you have a copy with you?

140
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:26,669
- No.

141
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,565
- You know,
I was thinking about you,

142
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:33,404
because we are looking
for some themes

143
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,671
for a couple of programs.

144
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,303
It's really great money.

145
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:39,677
It's easy.
- Themes?

146
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,376
- Themes for a couple programs.
- Jingles?

147
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:45,512
- No. Themes.

148
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,522
Lots of people do it.

149
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:51,925
- And lots of people give
blowjobs for crack.

150
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:56,529
- You're reading.
- Yep.

151
00:10:56,656 --> 00:11:00,468
- You finally learned how.

152
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:04,735
- The Spirituality
of Imperfection. Okay.

153
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,140
"Okay?"

154
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,371
- What?
- What do you mean, "Okay"?

155
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,676
- What? Nothing.

156
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:15,809
- Nothing?

157
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:19,548
- Yeah. What?
- What? Yeah.

158
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,159
- Yeah, what? Nothing.
- Nothing.

159
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:25,854
- Nothing. Good for you.
- Good for me what?

160
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:28,693
- If that stuff works for you.
- "That stuff"'?

161
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:31,028
- That Jesus stuff.
- Its not "Jesus stuff".

162
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:32,830
- No I didn't-
- It's not Billy Graham.

163
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,665
- I didn't say that it was.

164
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:38,606
- You might as well have.
Just... you know, your attitude.

165
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,836
- My attitude?

166
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:42,968
- Your attitude. Yeah.

167
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,912
This restaurant.
What the fuck is this place?

168
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:49,781
Fucking quail?
Fifteen-dollar potato soup?

169
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,718
An hour late?

170
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,592
- It was 45 minutes.
- I thought it was 15.

171
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,457
- Well, you said 45.

172
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:00,530
- You said 15
and now you're saying 45.

173
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,428
- Because you said 45.

174
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,398
- Yeah, it was actually
a fucking hour.

175
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:08,096
- You were early.
When have you ever been early?

176
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,138
It is not my fault
you were early.

177
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:11,400
- It's not your fault, no.

178
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,441
It's never your fault,
just like in London.

179
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,479
- Oh, okay. Because
you're the one who disappeared.

180
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:18,343
How do you think
that made me feel?

181
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,610
- Made you feel, made you feel.
You, you, you.

182
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,152
It's still all you.
- Oh, take a look at yourself.

183
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:25,721
- Oh, you're talking to me
with your attitude?

184
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:29,054
And your, what,
"rebranding the network"?

185
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:32,719
And your, what, $2,000 sweater?
How much did that sweater cost?

186
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,059
And "I know the chef",
laying on the bullshit

187
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:36,393
just like always.

188
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,399
Offering me jingle work?
Give me a break.

189
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:40,731
I didn't show up here to eat
your disrespect for dinner.

190
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,032
- So why did you come?

191
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,606
- I don't know, maybe because
I thought I'd get an apology.

192
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:46,608
- For what?
- "For what"?

193
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,280
- OK. I'm sorry.
- What for?

194
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:52,177
- Whatever
you want me to be sorry for.

195
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:54,306
- Let's start with being late
and work backwards.

196
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,420
- Okay. I'm sorry I was late.

197
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,386
- Who is 45 minutes late
by accident?

198
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:02,015
- Like you were never late.
Like you're perfect.

199
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,150
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

200
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,289
- Shit.

201
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,506
- Woo... We're back.

202
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,133
- Yep.

203
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:26,438
- So, how's
the spirituality going?

204
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,882
- Mmm... so-so.

205
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,955
I'm pretty good
with the imperfection, though.

206
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,491
- I'm sorry I was late.

207
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:42,895
- There's a solution.
- What?

208
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:45,093
- Get a watch.

209
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:50,198
- Yeah.

210
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,331
- Got to wash my hands.

211
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,401
- Waiter.

212
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:23,665
- Waiter?

213
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:27,259
Can I have a coffee, please?
- Sure.

214
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,810
- I know why you're here.

215
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,458
- I told you why I'm here.

216
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:53,529
- No, why you're really here.

217
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,654
- Why am I really here?

218
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:00,694
- I don't need your help, okay?

219
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:01,998
- My help?

220
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,038
- A job or whatever.

221
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:06,234
And don't try to slip any cash
in my pocket

222
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:09,039
when I'm not looking.
I'm fine. I've got what I need.

223
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,341
- What's that?

224
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,349
- To do the next right thing

225
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,716
and maintain a conscious
connection with my higher power,

226
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:19,789
just like the book says.

227
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:26,222
- So, do you pray?

228
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:27,763
- Do I pray?

229
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:32,262
- Get down on your knees
and humble yourself

230
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:33,802
before your higher power?

231
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,998
- Not with that attitude,
I don't.

232
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:41,508
- Maybe...

233
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:44,011
it's different for addicts.

234
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,843
- Not really.

235
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:48,747
A drunk is just a messier junkie.

236
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:51,285
- I guess.

237
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,821
- Not you, though.

238
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,151
You're terminally unique.

239
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:03,590
You don't do meetings?

240
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:06,032
- I do meetings.

241
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:08,661
- But you don't pray?

242
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:14,037
- I'm more of an agnostic
than anything else.

243
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:17,045
- Yeah, well, so am I.

244
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:18,944
It's just questioning.

245
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:20,744
Agnostic means "I don't know".

246
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,511
Who isn't an agnostic?

247
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:25,083
Who can say they know?

248
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,212
- I've met a few.

249
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:34,728
- When did you start
to eat like that?

250
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:36,730
- I always ate like this.
Like what?

251
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:39,563
- You used to eat like me.

252
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:44,106
- With my fork in my fist
like a spear? Or with my hands?

253
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,607
- No. You used to switch,
like me.

254
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,972
- Switch?

255
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:52,105
- Switch. Switch.
Like, switch.

256
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,952
- Mmm...

257
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,683
I never switched.
- You switched.

258
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,453
- I didn't switch.
I was well raised.

259
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,220
- You weren't well raised.

260
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,829
- Yes, I was,

261
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:08,659
and so were you.

262
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:11,666
Our fathers went to work
in their Oldsmobiles every morning.

263
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,771
Our mothers stayed home, ironed napkins,
and made macaroni casserole.

264
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:16,201
That's the way it was.

265
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:18,565
We just played
rock and roll house.

266
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:20,540
At least we were
honest about it then.

267
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:25,313
- My mother never
ironed our napkins.

268
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:29,749
- No, but your mother made
excellent macaroni casserole.

269
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,620
- To macaroni casserole.

270
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:35,816
- How about...

271
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,859
we agnostics.

272
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,985
- We agnostics.

273
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,635
- Come with me.

274
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,707
- All right.

275
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:02,318
But I'm not doing anything.

276
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,318
I said I'm not doing anything.

277
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:09,817
Did you hear me when I said that?
I'm not doing anything?

278
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:17,032
- I want to change.

279
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,863
- Your clothes?

280
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,232
- Yeah.
- You look fine.

281
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,135
- I look like I work in television.

282
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,139
- You do work in television.

283
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:26,971
- I just... I want to change.

284
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,670
- But you're not going to wear
the $2,000 sweater?

285
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:31,678
You probably bought it
just for tonight.

286
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,680
- It wasn't $2,000.

287
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:34,875
- One thousand?
- No.

288
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,078
- Nine hundred.
- No. Lend me something.

289
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:39,086
Lend me something.
I can wear something of yours.

290
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:41,088
- You want
to wear something of mine?

291
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,625
- Yeah. We used to do that
all the time.

292
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,854
Why not?

293
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:47,657
- Hmm...

294
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:53,096
Uh... I wasn't expecting
a guest from LA.

295
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,728
- I am not "from" LA.

296
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,932
I live mere. I'm from here.

297
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:00,805
I'm from down the street,
around the corner from you.

298
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:03,140
- Not in a $900 sweater,
you're not.

299
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:05,874
- It wasn't $900.
- Eight-fifty.

300
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:08,280
Bingo!

301
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:12,778
- I just want to change!

302
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:15,323
- All right.
You can say hi to Brian.

303
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:16,824
- You're kidding!

304
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,656
- What?

305
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:35,202
- So...
- So...

306
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:37,644
- Yeah.

307
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,407
So, you're good?

308
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,978
- Yeah.
- Good.

309
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:46,521
- Yep.

310
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:48,249
- You want some cereal?

311
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,327
- No. Thanks.

312
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,021
We just had dinner.

313
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:02,071
- Well, I'm going to get back
to the novel.

314
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:06,167
- You're writing a novel?
- It's more of a memoir, actually.

315
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,175
- Oh.
- Yeah.

316
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,745
It's either going to be called

317
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:12,747
The Average Life
of a Magnificent Man, or...

318
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:16,250
The Magnificent Life
of an Average Man.

319
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:21,688
- They're both-
- Compelling.

320
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:23,815
- Yeah, but don't worry.

321
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,759
Either way, it's not going
to be full disclosure.

322
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,027
You know.

323
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,432
- Oh.

324
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:40,975
- Yeah.
So no worries.

325
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,773
- Oh.

326
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:46,849
- The only thing clean
are t-shirts.

327
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,316
- I'll just take a t-shirt.

328
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:04,563
- Ah! Ha! Ha!

329
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,432
She's still got it!
- Stop.

330
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,828
- Ah, well, this is not
going to work.

331
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:11,031
- What?

332
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,734
- Well, we're dressed the same now.

333
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:16,368
- Lots of people wear
ironic t-shirts.

334
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,481
- Why is The Commodores ironic?

335
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:21,379
- It's just,
a band t-shirt is ironic.

336
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,612
- But why?
- It's... usefulness.

337
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:27,053
- Hmm... I'm going
to put on something else.

338
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,318
- Here, wear my sweater.

339
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,655
- Oh...

340
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:34,161
All right, baby,
I'll wear your sweater.

341
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,295
She's a brick

342
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:39,629
House

343
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:41,795
She's mighty mighty

344
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:43,804
Commodores.
- Yeah.

345
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,135
- So it's here.

346
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:48,433
Sweet memories.

347
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:53,143
- Sometimes.

348
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:56,411
She's a brick... house

349
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,099
- Brian?

350
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,070
- It's comfortable.

351
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,066
- Do you love him?

352
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:24,772
- Love is a minefield.
Love is a-

353
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,280
A battlefield

354
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,114
- This is love:

355
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,745
I secretly believe
that I'm unloveable,

356
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,824
and then I meet you.

357
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:37,620
You taught me
that you loved me.

358
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,786
I loved you
because you loved me,

359
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,864
but that has nothing to do
with you.

360
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:44,729
It's about you loving me.
I only love you

361
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:48,804
because I imagine myself
unloveable,

362
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,464
and you, against all odds,
love me.

363
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,473
And then, at some point,
you do something

364
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,475
that makes me think
that you don't love me,

365
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,170
which I'm more ready to believe

366
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:59,248
than you loving me-
because I'm unloveable.

367
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:02,409
So I stop loving you,
because I only love you

368
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,885
because you love me,
and I'm unloveable.

369
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:08,983
- What about
the other person?

370
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:12,220
- Who?
- The person who loves you.

371
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,057
- No, no, it's the same thing.

372
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:16,257
Everybody is doing
the same thing.

373
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:17,492
- Why?

374
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:20,831
- Because everybody thinks
they're unloveable too.

375
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,701
- I'm not unloveable.
I am all-loveable.

376
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:25,775
I am the very meaning
of loveable.

377
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:27,433
- Oh, yeah.
You really believe that?

378
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:29,603
- Hey, just because
you're living in the shadows

379
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:32,271
doesn't mean some of us aren't
walking in the sunshine.

380
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:35,112
- We block the sunshine
to make the shadow.

381
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,776
- How Go Ask Alice.

382
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:38,945
- People think
that love will complete them,

383
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:41,455
but, see, what people really
want isn't to feel complete.

384
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,491
What people really want is
peace of mind.

385
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:47,495
I used to sit around waiting
for it to come tap me on the shoulder:

386
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,792
"Hey there! Come with me."

387
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:55,303
For something to descend upon me
and lift me out of my shit.

388
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:58,704
But no, I had to do the work,

389
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:03,336
and, you know, the work started

390
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:06,642
when I stopped waiting
for someone to love me.

391
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,712
- Well, I think you're running
away from something.

392
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,222
- What?

393
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,293
- Ghosts.

394
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:19,292
The future.

395
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:22,023
Ghosts of the future.

396
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:42,610
- Yeah, I don't know.
I think I'm going to head.

397
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,407
- What is the problem?

398
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:47,949
- Nothing has changed.
It's just like yesterday.

399
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:52,146
- Tomorrow was always just
yesterday disguised as today.

400
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,654
It's all yesterday. Come on.

401
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,952
- No, I don't like yesterday.
- You were just scared of it.

402
00:26:57,082 --> 00:27:00,723
- What were you scared of?
- You.

403
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:03,833
- Memo.
- Come on.

404
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,993
Look, you could either be in the world,
or you could be out of the world.

405
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,162
You want to be in the world,
it's right in there.

406
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:13,037
You want to be out of the world,
go home to your apartment

407
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:15,735
and eat cereal with Brian.

408
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:19,745
I don't know how you're going
to sell records that way, so...

409
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:22,715
- Records? I didn't know
people still sold records.

410
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:26,084
- Whatever. They're downloading.
It still involves cash.

411
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:28,088
Come on in. See what
the kids are buying.

412
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:29,590
- I don't know...

413
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:33,753
- You're safe with me, baby.

414
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:37,731
I'm loveable enough
for both of us.

415
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,860
- Aww...
But I'm not standing in line.

416
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,563
- Okay, I'll go see
if I can find somebody.

417
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:50,173
- Sorry.

418
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:52,440
You go ask.

419
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,350
- Hey.

420
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:59,148
Are you Vic from Trigger?

421
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:01,416
- Oh, no. Sorry.

422
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:03,321
- Are you sure?

423
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:05,018
- Uh, pretty sure.

424
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,994
Vic!

425
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:11,362
- It is! it's Vic from Trigger!

426
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:17,102
- Can I touch the bottom
of your shoe?

427
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:20,869
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
Listen, listen, up we get.

428
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:24,742
- Vic from Trigger
just touched my hand!

429
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:28,180
- Wait. Wait.
Would you listen to our band?

430
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:30,343
- Oh, yeah.
Oh, a cassette

431
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:33,012
- I've got a CD. Do you want a CD?
- Oh, no. Cassettes are good.

432
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:35,420
I like cassettes
- Yeah, me too!

433
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,084
- Fuck digital.
Piss Flap doesn't do digital.

434
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,924
- Yo, Piss Flap! Nice.

435
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,929
Catchy.
- Yep.

436
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,625
- Bill Gates can keep his hands
off of Piss Flap, okay?

437
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:51,106
- I'll see you... girls later.

438
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,266
Come on!

439
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,309
- Bye!
- Bye.

440
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:44,352
- Well, this is not so bad.

441
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:46,359
- In what way?

442
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:47,554
- We're going to get fucked up.

443
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:50,131
- Woo. Fucked up.

444
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:53,793
The tribes have gathered
and the natives are restless.

445
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:57,701
- If this is a tribe
then you are the chief.

446
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:59,069
- Aww, Billy.

447
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:01,643
How's it going ihere, asshole?
- It's going good.

448
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:04,440
- You look great, Vicky.

449
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:07,873
- Kat.

450
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:09,815
- Hey, Bill.
- Hey.

451
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:12,615
- You scouting for talent?

452
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:15,987
- Not this time, no.
I'm just talking to Vic.

453
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:17,787
How's Florida?

454
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:21,227
- Uh, it's, uh...
kind of like Thunder Bay-

455
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:23,457
hot, and with tourists.

456
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:27,468
- He's fucking golfing.
Can you believe it?

457
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:29,299
- You know, it's cheaper

458
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:31,964
than a shrink, and it's less
crowded than meetings, so...

459
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:33,666
Boom!
- You and Alice Cooper.

460
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:35,869
- Yeah, I know...

461
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,071
He's pretty good.
I might be better.

462
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:41,013
Look, boys from EMI
came to me with it.

463
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:43,312
- Yeah, yeah...
- Ball's in your court.

464
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:45,250
- I'm thinking about it. Yeah.

465
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:48,255
- EMI. EMI!

466
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:52,384
EMI! EMI! EMI!

467
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,656
- E-M-I!

468
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:55,992
- How's LA?

469
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,327
- LA.

470
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:00,936
- Yeah?
Staying out of trouble?

471
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:03,335
- Do I look like I'm staying
out of trouble?

472
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:06,533
- Yeah, but you were always
good at disguises, so...

473
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,403
- Don't worry about me.

474
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:14,608
- "Don't worry about me."

475
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:16,844
Keep an eye on her.
- Mm-hmm.

476
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:19,785
- Somethings up there.
- Yeah.

477
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:23,586
All right.
- All right. Mmm!

478
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,023
EMI!

479
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:04,490
- Hey. What's up?
- Nothing. I dunno.

480
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:08,001
I'm not feeling this scene.
- It's not so bad.

481
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:12,770
- You got a little attention.
- What?

482
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:15,309
- I saw that kid outside.

483
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:18,437
Oooh, oooh.

484
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:21,209
And the boys from EMI want to meet.

485
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:23,580
- Whatever.

486
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:26,382
- Doesn't take much
to wake up your ego.

487
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:28,616
- It's not about my ego.
It's just, you know,

488
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:30,783
I've got this music
coming out and...

489
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:32,952
I've been asking myself why,
you know?

490
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:35,121
Like, what's the point
of another song?

491
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:37,893
It's not the music; it's who
the music brings together,

492
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:41,128
and that's what we've been
looking for.

493
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:44,900
- And your 12 songs
of acoustic intro-spec-tion

494
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:47,475
are going to bring
the whole world together?

495
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:49,134
- What?

496
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:51,144
No... That's not
what I'm saying.

497
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:54,443
- Maybe you should go out there
and do one of your new numbers.

498
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:56,449
- What? "Acoustic introspection"?

499
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:58,645
What happened to turn you into
such a bitch all of a sudden?

500
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:01,518
- Just don't look for depth
in this scene, okay?

501
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:04,126
This is the same superficial
shit it always was,

502
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:06,125
only actually
it's fucking worse.

503
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,127
- Whatever,
it's still rock 'n' roll.

504
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:10,755
- Ha! Rock 'n' roll...

505
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:13,334
Rock 'n' roll is
a fucking smell.

506
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:16,871
It's a whiff you get
and it reminds you of something.

507
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,872
It's an odour.

508
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:24,003
- All right, well,
let's go smell the band.

509
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:04,579
- All right, people. This is
basically a stage area.

510
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,848
I'm looking for laminates
that say "full access".

511
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:08,924
If I don't see laminates
with the words "full access",

512
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,754
you're going out front with
the regular folk, all right?

513
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,123
- We're, um...
- Oh, I know, I know.

514
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:15,754
My God, I know, you're Trigger.
I'm a huge fan.

515
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,798
You made high school
less than hell, honestly.

516
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:20,869
I bow down, really.
Just, tonight it's business.

517
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:22,835
Guys,
I don't see your laminates.

518
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,134
Can you please be somewhere else
right now? Thank you.

519
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:28,403
Thank you for putting this whole
thing together, by the way.

520
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:30,069
- What?

521
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:34,149
- No, um, she just means, um...
just for being part of it.

522
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:36,582
- I thought you were on the board.

523
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:38,812
- No. No, no, no.

524
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:40,718
No, um, we're just...

525
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:44,554
We're just here to be here.
Happy to be here.

526
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:48,255
- Great.
Are you going to perform, or...?

527
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:51,799
- Uh, she's not, but I might.
- What?

528
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:55,837
- I mean, she might do something
acoustic from her new stuff.

529
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,564
- Okay.
- She's being a comedian.

530
00:34:57,695 --> 00:35:00,801
- No, I'm... I'm definitely
going to perform.

531
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,741
- Who are you going
to perform with?

532
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:05,473
- You can play with Fox Fire.
- Perfect. When?

533
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:06,843
- Now.

534
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:08,644
- Now? Okay. Okay.

535
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,150
- Great. It's done. All right.

536
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,811
Hannah, one half of Trigger
is coming towards you.

537
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:27,769
Bow down. Seriously.

538
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:29,667
- Save it for Carole Pope.

539
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,239
- I know.

540
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:35,535
- You guys good with that?
- Yeah, we're good.

541
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:40,046
- So, uh, we obviously have
a very special guest with us tonight.

542
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:43,618
Rock legends, Trigger.

543
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:49,854
Here's a song
that you might remember.

544
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:42,007
- What a cunt!

545
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:44,579
Look at her,
so fucking full of herself.

546
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,772
What a bitch!

547
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:48,782
Doesn't it just twist
your fucking tits?

548
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:51,580
You know, you make her look pretty
fucking good when it comes down to it.

549
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,349
At least she hasn't
cashed in all her chips.

550
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:56,617
At least she's still got
a fucking job.

551
00:36:56,747 --> 00:37:00,354
You and your shame,
and your fucking apologies,

552
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:03,090
and your fucking
making amends bullshit.

553
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,258
- Shut up.
- Give over.

554
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:09,064
Give over. It's just a matter
of time anyway.

555
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:11,469
Your music sucks,
your liver is fucked,

556
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:14,873
and you think you've got
another chance? You're dreaming!

557
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:17,206
All those prayers,
all those meetings...

558
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:19,941
Where does it get you?
Dead.

559
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:26,145
Oooh, that's nice.

560
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,317
Thank you, Edmonton!

561
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,712
Chicks rule!

562
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:56,962
Those bitches went off!

563
00:39:57,094 --> 00:39:59,438
That was like dropping a match
in a gas station.

564
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,304
What are you doing
dropping matches?

565
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:03,139
It wasn't my fault.

566
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:05,144
I can't go in there in these shoes!

567
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:07,875
Well, then take the shoes off!
Come on!

568
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:10,884
God damn it,
this shit is no fun sober!

569
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,010
Ugh!

570
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,650
- Piss Flap?

571
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:27,086
Poor kid.
- Ugh.

572
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:29,630
All right, I'll take a listen.

573
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:33,701
Ugh. Poor Piss Flap.

574
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:38,398
- It's better than The Shut Ups.
- What? We were 14!

575
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:39,906
- We were so lame.

576
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:43,603
- No, no, no.
The Shut Ups were pure.

577
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:47,705
The Shut Ups were
when we were perfect.

578
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:55,316
- Oh... I'm tired all the time.

579
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:58,222
- Yeah, I know.

580
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,989
I never used to get tired.

581
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:04,725
Well, I never slept.
I just passed out.

582
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:09,428
- Even if I did get tired,
I'd just take a drink

583
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,564
or a hit, and click again.

584
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:16,602
Even a nod isn't like being tired.

585
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:20,443
Going into a nod is like
the air turning to Jell-O.

586
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:24,109
and an emotional flatline,
but it's not like tired.

587
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:26,118
When I get tired now,
I feel:

588
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:29,122
"This is probably
how normal people feel.

589
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:32,489
This is as close to normal
as I'm ever going to get."

590
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:36,061
- Life's too short to get tired.

591
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:40,098
Life... Life is short,

592
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,534
but ssss... somethings long.
What do they Say?

593
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,970
Life... Life is short,
but hell is long.

594
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:47,439
Well, that's what
my grandmother used to say.

595
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:50,243
- Hell...

596
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:52,745
I don't know if it's long,
but it's deep.

597
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,508
- Mmm.

598
00:42:54,638 --> 00:42:57,482
And dark.

599
00:42:57,608 --> 00:43:00,714
Dark and deep.
And deep and dark.

600
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:03,188
And deep and dark...

601
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:05,726
Deep.

602
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:08,625
- And dark.

603
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,197
- And deep.

604
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:15,035
- I remember in a meeting
one time, somebody said:

605
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:17,036
"They opened the gates,
and I thought

606
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:19,038
I was getting let into Heaven,

607
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:22,474
but it turned out
I was getting let out of Hell."

608
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,102
- That's good.

609
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:30,415
- Well, it's all deep and dark,
isn't it?

610
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:38,385
- You know what started it for me...

611
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:43,422
the real beginning of the descent?

612
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:47,368
Love.

613
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:53,399
That Scottish guy I met
in London when I left the tour.

614
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,908
All fucked up and beautiful.

615
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:01,575
Or maybe he was just beautiful
because he was fucked up.

616
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:06,518
And he knew how fucked up
he was, like I did.

617
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:09,625
Sometimes it was like looking in a mirror.

618
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:15,162
And he'd get that same look
in his eyes.

619
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:17,731
I could see
what he was doing to himself.

620
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:20,768
And I wanted to help him.

621
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:25,567
More than wanting to party with him,
I wanted to help him.

622
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:30,770
And that's what made me think
it was love.

623
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:32,642
It was.

624
00:44:34,638 --> 00:44:37,448
Doesn't matter how long
you know someone.

625
00:44:37,574 --> 00:44:40,953
You can give them your heart
in a minute.

626
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:42,523
Your soul.

627
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:46,287
And...

628
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:48,055
we did.

629
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:52,826
And we were going to help
each other stay clean.

630
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:57,031
And we did for a while, and...

631
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:02,270
I'd slip, and he'd be there
to catch me, and...

632
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:05,073
I'd do that for him, too.

633
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:09,207
But then it only took
one time. Once.

634
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:12,377
We hit it together.

635
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:15,388
It was a free fall.

636
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:23,991
His uncle had this apartment
in Paris, and...

637
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:27,796
the uncle lived in Dubai
or some fuck where.

638
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:30,064
And we stayed there
for a month,

639
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:32,674
and by the end of it,
we didn't talk to anybody

640
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:35,242
but the dealers who came by.

641
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,770
We were so bad,

642
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,906
one dealer started calling
to check on us.

643
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,749
And the deeper we got,
the more connected we were.

644
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:52,924
And it wasn't the drugs-

645
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:56,395
it wasn't the fuck up
that was killing us;

646
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,364
it was... the love.

647
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:04,200
I had split myself open
from the neck to the waist,

648
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:09,243
pried my ribs apart,
and he crawled in, and I...

649
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:13,442
I did the same with him.

650
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:17,916
One inside the other
inside the other.

651
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:25,053
We were this one person.
This... new organism.

652
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:29,427
It was like we were the mirror,

653
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:31,726
and then we scraped off the back-

654
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:33,835
the stuff that holds the reflection-

655
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:38,235
and... crushed it up
and cooked it and shot it...

656
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:43,535
Everything was dead.

657
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:45,975
But the love.

658
00:46:47,604 --> 00:46:49,914
And the love was death.

659
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:54,045
And it never made a sound
but it was the loudest thing you ever heard.

660
00:46:56,513 --> 00:46:59,323
It was over for me.
It was the end.

661
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:04,596
I was waking up disappointed
I was still alive.

662
00:47:07,024 --> 00:47:10,631
And all the time,
I had in the back of my head-

663
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:13,332
way deep in the back
of my head-

664
00:47:13,463 --> 00:47:17,172
me dying meant he would too.

665
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:20,643
So maybe that's what saved me-

666
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:23,684
knowing it was the only thing
that would save him.

667
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,678
One morning in Paris...

668
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:33,119
the apartment we lived in...

669
00:47:35,118 --> 00:47:39,157
was in an alley with another
building really close across,

670
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:42,498
so there was only
a small amount of time

671
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:45,300
when any sun would get in the room,

672
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:47,739
at this point
where the sun would rise

673
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,503
just over...

674
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:52,341
the building across
on its way to overheard.

675
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:55,279
There'd be this little lick
of sun...

676
00:47:55,405 --> 00:47:57,078
on the floor.

677
00:47:57,207 --> 00:48:00,518
It'd last maybe less than an hour.

678
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:04,053
Most mornings, I'd sit in the corner
and wait for it

679
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:08,061
and watch it move across the floor
and disappear,

680
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:11,689
but this one time
it was... like... it...

681
00:48:11,822 --> 00:48:13,768
wasn't moving.

682
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:16,766
Like it was staying there,

683
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:19,067
like it was calling to me,

684
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:21,198
so I...

685
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:24,471
I crawled
across the floor toward it,

686
00:48:24,601 --> 00:48:26,376
slowly, slowly inward it,

687
00:48:26,503 --> 00:48:29,575
and I... I stuck my hand
in it. I...

688
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:34,315
just laid my hand
on the floor in the sunlight,

689
00:48:34,444 --> 00:48:37,357
and my body soaked it in
through my hand,

690
00:48:37,481 --> 00:48:40,428
and it was like
the sunlight went to my brain,

691
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:43,121
like it went straight
to my brain, like it...

692
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:46,962
woke me up for a second.

693
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,161
Like it burnt out
all the shit

694
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:52,399
for a... a minute.

695
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:57,940
And my brain told me: "Go!

696
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:00,105
Or he'll die."

697
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:02,774
And somehow I got up
and I...

698
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:08,052
put on some clothes,
and I left him sleeping on the sofa,

699
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:10,522
and I left and I got out
and I...

700
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:16,557
found the sun and I just
started walking toward it,

701
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:20,191
like I was trying
to walk into it,

702
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:23,737
thinking: "Go! Go! Go! Go!

703
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,601
Or he'll die".

704
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:29,599
And I never went back.

705
00:49:36,873 --> 00:49:39,717
- What was his name?
Something Scottish?

706
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:44,989
- Mark.
- Oh.

707
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:48,119
- Well, he said it
in that Scottish way.

708
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:49,628
Mark.

709
00:49:53,924 --> 00:49:55,926
- What happened to him?

710
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:04,272
So is that love?

711
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:06,506
Leaving people is love?

712
00:50:07,904 --> 00:50:09,906
- It's a kind of love.

713
00:50:14,077 --> 00:50:16,580
- Is that what happened to us?

714
00:50:22,586 --> 00:50:27,626
See, 'cause to me,
love isn't leaving, because...

715
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:29,635
love isn't something
that you're in-

716
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,832
that's just the love
that gets played on the radio.

717
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:36,274
And love isn't something
that crawls up inside you-

718
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,641
that's the love
they make movies about.

719
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:41,946
- What is it, then?

720
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:44,285
- I... I don't know.

721
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:48,383
I mean, I... I don't know.

722
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:51,986
But I know what it isn't.

723
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:57,393
I don't know.
Maybe my mother would know.

724
00:50:57,521 --> 00:50:58,864
Your mother.

725
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:02,399
They seem to be able
to make it work.

726
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:07,838
The mothers, the wives...

727
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:10,969
- Making it work?

728
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:14,272
Is that love?

729
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:16,941
- Making it work? No, that's
a song they play on the radio.

730
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:22,183
On those late-night call-in
dedication shows.

731
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,950
- To the wives.

732
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:29,087
- To the wives everywhere.

733
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,527
- Can I ask you a question?

734
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:42,026
- What?

735
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:48,706
- Who do you... pray to?

736
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,941
- I don't know...

737
00:52:54,304 --> 00:52:55,840
- See, how can you pray

738
00:52:55,972 --> 00:52:59,476
if you don't know
who you're praying to?

739
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:00,917
- I just...

740
00:53:01,044 --> 00:53:03,422
pray to whatever is...

741
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:05,993
keeping those other assholes sober.

742
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:12,622
- Right.

743
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:58,146
You sure this is it?

744
00:53:58,268 --> 00:54:00,145
That's what it says
on the card.

745
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:03,217
- Whatever.
Let's check it out, I guess.

746
00:54:06,843 --> 00:54:09,517
- Will you wait for us?
- How long?

747
00:54:11,848 --> 00:54:14,727
- This long.
- I'll wait.

748
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:18,990
- You'd better come back.

749
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:21,959
- Don't worry.
We'll be back.

750
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:32,975
Hmm...

751
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:35,743
I don't know...
- Yeah, I don't know, either.

752
00:54:35,872 --> 00:54:37,749
- I hated high school the first time.

753
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:39,751
- Needed to take 5 years to finish.

754
00:54:39,876 --> 00:54:42,220
- Good one.
- Let's get out of here.

755
00:54:42,345 --> 00:54:43,949
- Hey, hey! Hey!

756
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,957
Look what the oat dragged in!

757
00:54:46,082 --> 00:54:47,993
- B.B.! Hey, gal!

758
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:50,291
- I didn't think
I'd see you here tonight.

759
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,297
Hey, Kat!
- Hey, BB.

760
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:54,459
- Jesus, girl,
you're awful skinny.

761
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:56,571
Must be that LA diet, is it?

762
00:54:56,693 --> 00:54:58,604
Bullshit and bottled water?

763
00:54:58,728 --> 00:54:59,968
- Good one.

764
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:02,007
You look the same.
- Ouch!

765
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:03,236
- No, you look good.

766
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:05,403
- Oh, yeah, right.
I'm about 1,000 years old.

767
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:07,071
Shut up.

768
00:55:07,203 --> 00:55:09,080
Well, that was quite
the performance tonight.

769
00:55:09,205 --> 00:55:11,845
- It wasn't me!
- Oh, yeah, right. Never was.

770
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,579
Me neither.

771
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:15,485
- So, is this the after party?

772
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:17,489
- Oh, well, I guess
one of the suits thought

773
00:55:17,614 --> 00:55:20,561
it would be rad to get
messed up in a high school.

774
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:25,497
I don't know. Looks a bit like
Detroit Rock City meets Sweet Sixteen.

775
00:55:25,622 --> 00:55:29,627
Look at these kids.
Thank God I'm not their age now.

776
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:31,739
I would be dead in a weekend.

777
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:34,239
Hey, let's go
to the green room.

778
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:36,537
Come on.
All the stalwarts are gathered.

779
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,612
- There's a green room.
- Yes, there's a green room.

780
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:40,840
Come on. Let's go.
Come on. it'll be fun.

781
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:46,150
- Apparently, Jeremy took one look
at the high school, and he wouldn't even

782
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:48,483
come up the driveway.

783
00:55:48,611 --> 00:55:50,716
- He was probably scared
a bully would steal his bicycle.

784
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:52,849
- No, he's upgraded
to a scooter now.

785
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:54,586
- Which he rides all winter.

786
00:55:54,718 --> 00:55:57,130
Fucking Canadian.
- Aren't you Canadian?

787
00:55:57,253 --> 00:56:00,928
- I'm a Martian.
I'm a Saturnurite.

788
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:03,196
I'm a Plutonian.

789
00:56:03,326 --> 00:56:04,669
- Yeah, don't listen to him,
honey.

790
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:08,173
He is so Canadian,
he probably shits loonies

791
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:10,335
- Veins full of maple syrup-

792
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:12,572
if I could find one.

793
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:14,181
- Beer?

794
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:16,784
- No, no. I'm good.
- Oh, she's good, all right.

795
00:56:16,906 --> 00:56:19,409
She is very, very good.

796
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:22,546
- Toby played me some of the tracks
he engineered for you.

797
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:25,125
Really beautiful.
- Oh, it is what it is.

798
00:56:25,248 --> 00:56:27,194
- That's the way to go, you know?
Scale it way back.

799
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:29,422
.Just you and a piano.

800
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:30,860
Keep it simple.

801
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:33,729
That's right.
"Keep it simple, stupid."

802
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:08,886
- I think she sets you off.
I do.

803
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:11,999
- Well... maybe I set her off.

804
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:14,397
- Well, you good?
- Yeah.

805
00:58:14,524 --> 00:58:16,401
- Yeah? You clean?
- Yeah.

806
00:58:16,526 --> 00:58:20,406
- What about Kat?
- Uh, yeah. According to her.

807
00:58:22,365 --> 00:58:24,242
- You know, sometimes I think
it's easier for junkies.

808
00:58:24,367 --> 00:58:26,904
I mean, we've got the threat
of jail, right.

809
00:58:27,036 --> 00:58:30,381
But... drunks? What do they got
to worry about?

810
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:33,750
Just, well, blackouts
and cirrhosis.

811
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:36,915
- Well, that's something
to worry about.

812
00:58:37,046 --> 00:58:39,151
- Let me take you home.
- Oh, Kat's got a cab.

813
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:41,660
- No, no. I mean,
let me take you...

814
00:58:41,784 --> 00:58:43,525
home... with me.

815
00:58:43,653 --> 00:58:47,032
- Oh... Oh.
- Come on.

816
00:58:47,156 --> 00:58:48,829
You're so beautiful.

817
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:51,598
- Eh... Um...

818
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:53,071
Mm...

819
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:56,541
It feels kinda... incest-y.

820
00:58:56,666 --> 00:59:00,204
You know? Family...
Heh-heh-heh...

821
00:59:00,336 --> 00:59:02,646
- Okay, sorry.
I couldn't help myself.

822
00:59:02,772 --> 00:59:05,013
- That's all right.
- Well, maybe later, right?

823
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:08,122
Another time.
- Yep. You're the first in line.

824
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:11,282
- Well, I guess it should be
no surprise-

825
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:13,690
you can go home
with old money bags.

826
00:59:13,816 --> 00:59:16,456
- What? Who?
- Kat.

827
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:19,624
I mean, she put up the dinero
for this Whole Shindig.

828
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:22,330
- I think I'd know that
if she did.

829
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:25,234
- Oh, really? Okay.

830
00:59:25,361 --> 00:59:29,002
Well, I guess my sources aren't
all that reliable, then.

831
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,071
- Later...
- If you Change your mind,

832
00:59:33,202 --> 00:59:36,615
I got a Car. I can give you a lift.
Got a hybrid now.

833
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:40,414
No more "Mustang Sally".
I am saving the planet.

834
00:59:40,543 --> 00:59:42,216
- Right on.

835
01:00:11,574 --> 01:00:14,350
Hey. You ready to head out?

836
01:00:14,477 --> 01:00:15,455
Hey, what's up?

837
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,458
- Oh, yeah,
you're clean and sober!

838
01:00:19,582 --> 01:00:21,425
- Hold on.

839
01:00:21,551 --> 01:00:22,552
- Hey.

840
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:27,165
- Jesus.

841
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,099
- Here.

842
01:00:29,225 --> 01:00:32,866
Hey, it's no big deal.
This wasn't my idea. It was his.

843
01:00:32,996 --> 01:00:35,306
- Yeah, I wonder if his company
knows he smokes and drives.

844
01:00:35,431 --> 01:00:37,468
Maybe I should give them a call.

845
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,479
- What? Since when did you Start
snitching to employers?

846
01:00:40,603 --> 01:00:44,141
- You're exactly the same.
You say one thing and do another.

847
01:00:44,273 --> 01:00:46,378
- I never said
I wasn't smoking pot.

848
01:00:46,509 --> 01:00:49,046
Poi's not my problem.
- It's all a problem.

849
01:00:49,178 --> 01:00:51,488
- Yeah, for you, maybe.

850
01:00:51,614 --> 01:00:53,992
Aw, come on. Lighten up.

851
01:00:56,185 --> 01:00:57,664
We could just take a cab.

852
01:00:57,787 --> 01:00:59,733
- I'm not driving
with someone high.

853
01:00:59,856 --> 01:01:01,665
- Well, we'll call another cab.

854
01:01:01,791 --> 01:01:03,395
- I'd rather go with B.B.

855
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:06,769
- I don't live up to your expectation,
and you're just going to write me off?

856
01:01:06,896 --> 01:01:08,273
- It's not my expectation.

857
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:10,935
- But I never tried to Sell you
on my Sainthood.

858
01:01:11,067 --> 01:01:13,946
- Oh, yeah, yeah, sell-
that's all you've ever done,

859
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:17,483
from fucking lunchboxes...
prostitution...

860
01:01:17,607 --> 01:01:18,642
- What are you talking about?

861
01:01:18,775 --> 01:01:20,482
- I'm not talking to you
when you're high.

862
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:23,352
- I had two puffs.
It was Crappy Shit.

863
01:01:23,479 --> 01:01:26,221
I'm not high.

864
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:27,885
Okay, I fucked up.

865
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:30,520
- So now you're apologizing?
- No, I'm not apologizing-

866
01:01:30,653 --> 01:01:32,530
- Well, then get the fuck
away from me.

867
01:01:32,655 --> 01:01:34,430
- Wait, wait.

868
01:01:34,557 --> 01:01:37,128
- I don't want to play
these games any more,

869
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:39,297
and I don't want people
in my life who play these games.

870
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:41,739
- What games?
It's all a fucking game.

871
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:43,241
- "It's all a game."

872
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:46,142
You ask the question and
answer it in the same breath!

873
01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:49,148
- You think it's not? Wake up, sister.
Just because you've grown fucking wings

874
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:51,149
doesn't mean the world
has turned into Heaven.

875
01:01:51,274 --> 01:01:53,151
- Fuck you.
- Oh, good one. Nice one.

876
01:01:53,276 --> 01:01:55,347
Yeah, you really got me there.
Nice comeback.

877
01:01:56,112 --> 01:01:57,853
I'll see you after school.

878
01:01:58,748 --> 01:02:00,819
Don't forget
to do your biology homework.

879
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:02,429
Hey. Hey!

880
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:04,862
Don't walk away from me!

881
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:06,432
Shit.

882
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:09,400
Vic, wait.

883
01:02:09,525 --> 01:02:11,766
.Just wait.

884
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:14,067
- If you want to live
in a world of bullshit, fine.

885
01:02:14,197 --> 01:02:16,473
At least believe in it!
At least believe in something!

886
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:18,579
- I want to. I do.

887
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:22,712
- You've put this whole thing
together, didn't you?

888
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:26,945
- No.

889
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:29,022
- Don't you think
you should have told me that?

890
01:02:29,145 --> 01:02:32,285
- No, I did some consulting.
- What does that mean?!

891
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:34,395
- I just...
I threw some money at it.

892
01:02:34,517 --> 01:02:36,963
- You paid
for a tribute to yourself.

893
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:39,794
- It was a benefit.
- For your ego!

894
01:02:40,189 --> 01:02:41,930
- I.

895
01:02:43,326 --> 01:02:45,272
I just wanted to see you.

896
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:48,771
- Why?

897
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:53,975
- I don't know what I need.

898
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:55,480
You say you have what you need,

899
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:57,778
but I don't know
what that is for me.

900
01:02:59,709 --> 01:03:01,586
Nothing's... enough.

901
01:03:01,711 --> 01:03:03,918
Nothing's ever enough.

902
01:03:04,046 --> 01:03:05,582
And I...

903
01:03:05,715 --> 01:03:07,126
I feel...

904
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:10,120
I want to...

905
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:13,600
You know me.

906
01:03:13,723 --> 01:03:16,499
You are the only person
who knows me.

907
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:20,199
And I do what
I'm supposed to do, you know?

908
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:22,036
And there are these promises,

909
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:24,975
but they're not coming true
for me, and...

910
01:03:25,101 --> 01:03:28,173
...I need your help.

911
01:03:29,338 --> 01:03:31,841
- My help?

912
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:35,285
Fuck-
- Do you know hard it is for me

913
01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:37,789
being sober
every fucking day?

914
01:03:37,914 --> 01:03:42,454
- Oh, you and your wine coolers,
and your cranberry martinis!

915
01:03:42,585 --> 01:03:45,794
- Oh, you think I don't want
to get high too?

916
01:03:45,922 --> 01:03:48,630
- You just did!

917
01:03:48,758 --> 01:03:50,431
Congratulations!

918
01:04:12,281 --> 01:04:14,659
OW! Oh!

919
01:04:14,784 --> 01:04:18,027
- Oh! Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

920
01:04:18,154 --> 01:04:19,394
- I'm bleeding!

921
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:21,160
- Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
I was just trying to-

922
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:22,769
- Trying to what? You hit me!

923
01:04:22,892 --> 01:04:25,133
- Just talk to me.

924
01:04:25,261 --> 01:04:27,400
- If you're going
to fuck yourself up,

925
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,806
I don't want to be around
to watch, okay?

926
01:04:29,932 --> 01:04:32,879
- I had two puffs.
I got overwhelmed.

927
01:04:33,002 --> 01:04:35,039
I just, I got a lot going on,
that's all.

928
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:37,412
- Yeah, well, I got a lot
on my mind, too, all right?

929
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:38,541
I might be fucking dying.

930
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:41,814
- What?
- I've got a liver biopsy.

931
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:45,286
- You had one,
or you have to have one?

932
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:46,791
- They saw something.

933
01:04:46,916 --> 01:04:48,793
- You had one,
or you have to have one?

934
01:04:48,918 --> 01:04:50,955
- I'm having one!

935
01:04:51,087 --> 01:04:52,964
- Okay, well, I've had two.

936
01:04:53,089 --> 01:04:56,127
It's... it's no big deal.
They're always seeing stuff on my liver.

937
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:59,638
- Oh, so, what, you're saying
your liver is worse than mine?

938
01:04:59,762 --> 01:05:01,571
- I know it is.
- My liver's like a sponge.

939
01:05:01,697 --> 01:05:04,576
- It's supposed to be like a sponge!
Mine's like a fucking stone.

940
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:07,579
- I don't think so.
- Uh, don't tell me about my liver.

941
01:05:07,703 --> 01:05:10,582
- Yeah, well don't tell me about my liver!
I think I know my own liver!

942
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:12,583
- Ah, but if you did,
you wouldn't need to have a biopsy.

943
01:05:12,708 --> 01:05:14,710
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

944
01:05:19,215 --> 01:05:21,786
Everybody's dying.
- Oh!

945
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:24,421
I don't care
about the destination.

946
01:05:24,553 --> 01:05:27,227
I'm more concerned
about the velocity.

947
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:32,437
- Here, let me see your eyes.
- Why?

948
01:05:32,561 --> 01:05:35,906
- Iridology.
I see the best iridologist in LA.

949
01:05:38,734 --> 01:05:40,111
Uh...

950
01:05:40,236 --> 01:05:42,113
Okay.
- What?

951
01:05:42,238 --> 01:05:45,447
- Well, just look up
into that lighting.

952
01:05:45,574 --> 01:05:47,576
Oh...
- What?

953
01:05:48,577 --> 01:05:51,285
What?
- Sugar. You eat a lot of sugar?

954
01:05:51,414 --> 01:05:54,452
- I try to cui down.
- And salt.

955
01:05:54,583 --> 01:05:57,621
Yeah. Salt's the real problem.
You eat a lot of salt!

956
01:05:57,753 --> 01:06:00,893
- I like saliy...
- Well, salt..

957
01:06:01,023 --> 01:06:04,470
...Salt binds the toxins
so you can't Sweat them out.

958
01:06:04,593 --> 01:06:06,470
That's what's going on
with your liver.

959
01:06:06,595 --> 01:06:09,474
Do you read labels?
- What labels?

960
01:06:09,598 --> 01:06:10,576
- Food labels.

961
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:12,702
There's salt in everything.
You've got to read the labels.

962
01:06:12,835 --> 01:06:14,712
- The print is too small.

963
01:06:14,837 --> 01:06:18,751
- Well, wear your glasses
when you go to the store, you know?

964
01:06:20,376 --> 01:06:22,356
No more salt

965
01:06:24,213 --> 01:06:26,716
There's something on my liver.

966
01:06:28,718 --> 01:06:30,425
- It's the SEMI.

967
01:06:30,553 --> 01:06:32,430
It is.

968
01:06:32,555 --> 01:06:34,228
- Okay.

969
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:36,798
it's the salt.

970
01:06:36,926 --> 01:06:38,428
- It is.
- Yeah.

971
01:06:38,561 --> 01:06:41,542
- It is.
- Yeah.

972
01:06:43,532 --> 01:06:45,773
Okay.

973
01:06:55,044 --> 01:06:57,718
Let's get the fuck
out of here.

974
01:06:59,715 --> 01:07:02,594
- Oh!
- What?

975
01:07:02,718 --> 01:07:05,392
- Oh, it's just
my shoulder goes out sometimes.

976
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:06,898
- It's not my fault.

977
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:09,060
- I didn't say that it was.

978
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:13,003
- You're the one who attacked me.
- Fine. Fine.

979
01:07:13,129 --> 01:07:15,666
- My lip is killing me.
- Oh, come on.

980
01:07:15,798 --> 01:07:18,677
- Are you sure it's not bleeding?
- It's not bleeding.

981
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:24,545
- What's wrong with your leg?
- Oh, it's my knee.

982
01:07:24,673 --> 01:07:27,347
From running.
I might have to stop running.

983
01:07:27,476 --> 01:07:30,116
- Mm. You shouldn't be
attacking people.

984
01:07:30,246 --> 01:07:33,455
Here, give me your arm.
- Well, fuck, watch my Shoulder.

985
01:07:33,582 --> 01:07:34,856
OW!

986
01:07:34,984 --> 01:07:37,624
- Is it your shoulder
or your collarbone?

987
01:07:37,753 --> 01:07:39,391
- Uh, it's my shoulder.

988
01:07:39,522 --> 01:07:41,900
- 'Cause you broke
your collarbone that time in Cuba

989
01:07:42,024 --> 01:07:43,401
when you fell off a moped.

990
01:07:43,526 --> 01:07:46,132
- No, no. it's my shoulder.
It's my rotator cuff.

991
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:49,141
- Is that the thing that you scrape?
- Yeah.

992
01:07:49,265 --> 01:07:51,472
I'm wrecking my knee, too.

993
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:55,547
You and I
we make a grand salute

994
01:07:55,671 --> 01:07:57,878
Stare at each other

995
01:07:58,007 --> 01:08:03,252
Like lost little birds
across the room

996
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:07,418
And I remember
the way you looked

997
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:10,463
I learned how to dance

998
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:14,728
But I'd never shown it to you

999
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:17,599
My love

1000
01:08:18,994 --> 01:08:21,133
Stay for a while

1001
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:24,403
While our leaves are still green

1002
01:08:24,533 --> 01:08:26,809
Please

1003
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:28,813
- We played our song.

1004
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:31,316
- Our hit.

1005
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,420
- Our greatest hit.

1006
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:37,179
- We Should put it out on EP.

1007
01:08:37,313 --> 01:08:39,156
- Asingle.

1008
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:42,451
- Forty-five.

1009
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:49,402
Running out of room

1010
01:08:49,525 --> 01:08:52,699
All night saying

1011
01:08:52,828 --> 01:08:57,834
That you're standing
alongside gone

1012
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:00,311
I know I tried

1013
01:09:00,436 --> 01:09:02,814
But it's hard sometimes

1014
01:09:02,938 --> 01:09:05,782
The routes don't take

1015
01:09:05,908 --> 01:09:08,821
It takes a while

1016
01:09:08,944 --> 01:09:11,550
And you pull at the strings

1017
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:14,456
But they're broken it seems

1018
01:09:14,583 --> 01:09:18,963
The dance isn't over for me

1019
01:09:19,088 --> 01:09:24,629
No my love

1020
01:09:25,528 --> 01:09:28,475
I know I was wrong

1021
01:09:28,597 --> 01:09:33,046
But you know
that you'll always be

1022
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:35,547
My love...
- Check them out.

1023
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:37,378
It's quite a sight.

1024
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:41,548
- I always wanted to do that.

1025
01:09:42,545 --> 01:09:45,924
- You always used to say
you wanted to snowshoe.

1026
01:09:46,048 --> 01:09:48,153
- Yeah.
Yeah, and I did.

1027
01:09:49,818 --> 01:09:51,559
- How was it?

1028
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:53,394
- Brutal.

1029
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:56,696
Cold.
- Well, what did you expect?

1030
01:09:56,825 --> 01:09:57,860
- Elation.

1031
01:09:57,993 --> 01:10:00,940
- Ah, well, that's setting
the bar a bit high, I think.

1032
01:10:01,063 --> 01:10:03,805
- But I did, though,
feel something like that.

1033
01:10:03,933 --> 01:10:05,173
Elation.

1034
01:10:06,168 --> 01:10:09,172
But it was afterwards,
sitting at the fire,

1035
01:10:09,305 --> 01:10:12,514
thinking about having snowshoed.

1036
01:10:12,641 --> 01:10:14,518
But that's the thing, isn't it?

1037
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:18,218
It's not the doing that feels good;
it's the having done it.

1038
01:10:18,347 --> 01:10:20,486
- Yeah, it's the surviving it.

1039
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:27,390
- What if the sun doesn't come up?

1040
01:10:29,758 --> 01:10:31,760
- The sun will come up.

1041
01:10:36,599 --> 01:10:38,670
- What if the Mayans are right?

1042
01:10:39,868 --> 01:10:42,144
Calendar stops
and it all just ends.

1043
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:50,319
- Wasn't that supposed
to have already happened?

1044
01:10:50,446 --> 01:10:54,485
- And the Earth explodes
into four flaming orbs.

1045
01:10:54,617 --> 01:10:56,995
- A flaming orb.

1046
01:10:57,119 --> 01:10:59,531
- According to the Mayans,
four flaming orbs.

1047
01:10:59,655 --> 01:11:01,259
- Nice.

1048
01:11:03,726 --> 01:11:06,104
- And it just ends.

1049
01:11:06,228 --> 01:11:08,606
Everything reduced to balls of ash

1050
01:11:08,731 --> 01:11:11,735
and melted plastic
hurtling through space.

1051
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:15,738
What difference
does it all make then?

1052
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:20,418
All the music, the gigs,
the deals...

1053
01:11:22,077 --> 01:11:25,957
The art, the beauty, the men...

1054
01:11:26,081 --> 01:11:27,890
Jaeger...

1055
01:11:28,017 --> 01:11:31,260
Pregnancy tests, bad biopsies...

1056
01:11:34,089 --> 01:11:36,467
Maybe that's it:

1057
01:11:36,592 --> 01:11:39,698
there is no everything;
just me and my everything.

1058
01:11:39,828 --> 01:11:41,774
My calendar, my ending.

1059
01:11:46,235 --> 01:11:47,908
- A flaming orb.

1060
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,280
- Four flaming orbs.

1061
01:11:52,408 --> 01:11:55,446
- Okay.
Well, that's like four suns, right?

1062
01:11:55,577 --> 01:11:56,578
- Mm-hmm.

1063
01:11:56,712 --> 01:12:00,216
- And the sun created the universe,
so there you go.

1064
01:12:00,349 --> 01:12:04,422
You have four brand new universes.

1065
01:12:04,553 --> 01:12:07,261
- Four universes of fuck up.

1066
01:12:09,124 --> 01:12:11,263
- And wonder.

1067
01:12:11,393 --> 01:12:13,930
See, that's what people really want.

1068
01:12:14,063 --> 01:12:17,101
Wonder; not sex, not more stuff.

1069
01:12:17,232 --> 01:12:21,305
What they want is wonder.
That's... that's what...

1070
01:12:21,437 --> 01:12:24,077
the new world is: wonder.

1071
01:12:26,075 --> 01:12:29,181
Four new universes

1072
01:12:29,311 --> 01:12:30,619
of fuck up...

1073
01:12:30,746 --> 01:12:32,248
and wonder.

1074
01:12:34,249 --> 01:12:36,422
It's progress.

1075
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:40,093
- It's something.

1076
01:12:47,763 --> 01:12:49,265
- It's cold.

1077
01:12:50,432 --> 01:12:53,436
- You want your sweater?
- No, you keep it.

1078
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:03,584
This is nice.

1079
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:05,214
- Yeah.

1080
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:08,718
It's nice.

1081
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:14,056
- God.

1082
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:19,895
- Yeah.

1083
01:13:26,635 --> 01:13:31,175
This time in between
the day and the night

1084
01:13:31,306 --> 01:13:35,846
The light kills
my sense of life

1085
01:13:35,978 --> 01:13:38,720
So scared
I'll turn it on

1086
01:13:38,847 --> 01:13:40,793
Turn it on turn it on
turn it on

1087
01:13:45,287 --> 01:13:49,929
its dull this dusk
this desk this dust

1088
01:13:50,058 --> 01:13:52,470
My eyes adjust

1089
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:54,835
I'll blow out the Name

1090
01:13:56,064 --> 01:13:59,910
Can you and me remain

1091
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:05,309
Changes

1092
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:09,947
I've never been good
with change

1093
01:14:10,078 --> 01:14:14,618
I hate it when
it all stays the same

1094
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:19,324
Caught between
the cold and the wave

1095
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:23,062
My heart beats up again

1096
01:14:41,076 --> 01:14:42,783
Once said

1097
01:14:42,911 --> 01:14:45,585
Words make a world of their own

1098
01:14:45,714 --> 01:14:47,455
I misread

1099
01:14:47,583 --> 01:14:50,291
I can? get you
back on the phone

1100
01:14:50,419 --> 01:14:51,796
So tired

1101
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:56,369
I'll turn it off turn it off
turn it off

1102
01:14:59,795 --> 01:15:04,301
How's that
last week we were whole

1103
01:15:04,433 --> 01:15:07,073
You're far away

1104
01:15:07,202 --> 01:15:10,615
And I hardly know

1105
01:15:10,739 --> 01:15:14,380
Can you and me delay

1106
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:20,025
Changes

1107
01:15:20,148 --> 01:15:24,460
I've never been good
with change

1108
01:15:24,586 --> 01:15:29,228
I hate it when
it all stays the same

1109
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:33,602
Caught between
the gold and the gain

1110
01:15:36,231 --> 01:15:38,541
Changes

1111
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:43,082
I've never been good
with change

1112
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:47,950
Troubled when
it all stays the same

1113
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:52,456
I'm caught between
this cold and the wave

1114
01:15:52,581 --> 01:15:56,757
My heart beats up again

1115
01:16:17,172 --> 01:16:21,643
Are you my trouble

1116
01:16:21,777 --> 01:16:26,385
Are you my trouble

1117
01:16:26,515 --> 01:16:31,760
Are you my trouble

1118
01:16:31,887 --> 01:16:35,858
Trouble

1119
01:16:35,991 --> 01:16:40,565
Are you my trouble

1120
01:16:40,696 --> 01:16:45,076
Are you my trouble

1121
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:50,673
Are you my trouble
