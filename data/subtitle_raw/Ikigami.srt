1
00:01:04,797 --> 00:01:09,928
In this land there is freedom,
peace, and wealth.

2
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:14,701
But suddenly one day, without mercy...

3
00:01:15,441 --> 00:01:19,468
...the nation discards
a handful of its citizens.

4
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:25,444
Resistance is futile.
One can only accept the fate...

5
00:01:25,918 --> 00:01:27,579
...our nation imposes.

6
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,421
Kamoi, Yosuke

7
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,650
Time to death:

8
00:02:08,861 --> 00:02:11,386
One Hour

9
00:02:33,352 --> 00:02:35,217
You're not drunk enough!

10
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:39,285
Interoffice memo: I need elixir!

11
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:58,307
Shimoyama!

12
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:00,374
Yeah?

13
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:02,312
It's been a while.

14
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:04,548
What is it?

15
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,917
You don't remember me?

16
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:08,850
Huh?

17
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:13,052
I'm Yosuke Kamoi.

18
00:03:17,663 --> 00:03:21,121
What are you talking about?
That was years ago!

19
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:36,077
I'm sorry! Forgive me!

20
00:03:42,054 --> 00:03:43,521
I didn't mean it!

21
00:03:44,323 --> 00:03:46,791
It was just a game!

22
00:03:47,326 --> 00:03:48,156
A game?

23
00:04:05,811 --> 00:04:09,577
You call that a game?

24
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:13,213
Forgive me! I'll do whatever you say!

25
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:16,084
No.

26
00:04:16,722 --> 00:04:19,953
Kill me and you'll go to jail!

27
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:23,959
Jail? I won't be going there!

28
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:53,616
< IKIGAMI: The Ultimate Limit >

29
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:27,783
Congratulations on
your first day of school.

30
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:31,830
I hope you'll all study hard...

31
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:36,364
...and grow up to be fine,
upstanding people.

32
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:42,338
But first I have
something important to tell you.

33
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:50,114
Between the ages of 18 and 24,
a number of today's Grade 1 pupils...

34
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:52,910
...will die for our nation.

35
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:57,312
We don't know who they will be.

36
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:02,752
It could even be one of you.

37
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:11,634
But don't be afraid.
Those who die serve the nation.

38
00:06:11,837 --> 00:06:13,828
It is a very great honor.

39
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:16,007
Do you all understand?

40
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,005
Yes!

41
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,440
We will now take attendance.

42
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:24,104
Speak right up when your name is called.

43
00:06:24,316 --> 00:06:29,982
When I was 6, before I understood,
I was given the injection.

44
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:36,120
And then last year I got through
my 'period of service'.

45
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,627
I turned 25.

46
00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:46,768
I became one of those
who had fulfilled his duty.

47
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:51,637
As you know, the 'Maintenance
of National Prosperity Law'...

48
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:54,845
...implants the fear of death...

49
00:06:55,347 --> 00:06:58,908
...in the citizens of a nation at peace.

50
00:06:59,618 --> 00:07:02,052
By reaffirming the value of life...

51
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:06,723
...it is the cornerstone of our nation.

52
00:07:09,361 --> 00:07:13,297
All citizens,
upon entering elementary school...

53
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:17,026
...are required to be inoculated.

54
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:24,302
Mixed in with
0.1 per cent of these injections...

55
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,978
...is a special nano-capsule.

56
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:31,008
It is injected into
one person in a thousand.

57
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:38,556
When that person is between 18 and 24,
at a specified date and time...

58
00:07:38,757 --> 00:07:42,523
...the capsule shatters
in the pulmonary artery.

59
00:07:45,397 --> 00:07:50,425
There is no way of knowing
if you carry the capsule.

60
00:07:51,136 --> 00:07:52,933
It could be anyone.

61
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:59,538
This risk heightens awareness
of the value of life.

62
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,881
It promotes civic-mindedness...

63
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:05,973
...morality...

64
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:11,251
...and the desire to be
a productive citizen.

65
00:08:12,224 --> 00:08:13,521
Are you OK?

66
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:19,697
Since this law was instituted,
the national suicide rate...

67
00:08:20,265 --> 00:08:23,826
...and crime rates
have fallen remarkably.

68
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:32,307
Our stagnant productivity and GDP
have risen dramatically.

69
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:39,784
It is because of the Prosperity Law
that our nation leads the world...

70
00:08:39,985 --> 00:08:40,917
It's wrong!

71
00:08:47,826 --> 00:08:50,659
The law is wrong!

72
00:08:54,366 --> 00:08:58,996
That law stole my girlfriend's life!

73
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:03,601
The state forced a senseless death on her!

74
00:09:04,843 --> 00:09:07,243
Your girlfriend...

75
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,341
...was sacrificed for the state.

76
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:15,782
No! There's something wrong
with this country! It's crazy!

77
00:09:23,495 --> 00:09:25,395
You all think so!

78
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,531
Why won't anyone speak up?!

79
00:09:32,304 --> 00:09:34,602
You think so, don't you?

80
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:40,144
Hey! What's going on?! Let go of me!

81
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,444
Help me!

82
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:44,707
Help!

83
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:49,713
Let go of me!

84
00:09:49,988 --> 00:09:52,684
Hey, what are you doing?!

85
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:25,618
There is one decadent thinker
in every year's intake.

86
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:29,820
Take great care in what you say and do.

87
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,134
To continue...

88
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:47,739
Those young people
with the capsule in their bodies...

89
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:51,748
...receive a notification
of their impending death...

90
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,416
...24 hours before it takes place.

91
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:59,490
These letters are known as ikigami.

92
00:11:00,025 --> 00:11:03,426
This is a service rendered by the state...

93
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:07,998
...to ensure recipients and families
a meaningful final 24 hours.

94
00:11:09,401 --> 00:11:15,533
Your task following this training
will be to deliver these letters.

95
00:11:16,341 --> 00:11:20,573
You are an elite, chosen by the state.

96
00:11:21,513 --> 00:11:24,607
There is honor in this work.

97
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:27,044
Do it with pride.

98
00:11:28,086 --> 00:11:33,114
We will now offer a silent prayer
to those on whose deaths...

99
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:36,260
...our prosperity rests.

100
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,195
Pray!

101
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,220
'Fujimoto', isn't it?

102
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:38,920
Yes, sir.

103
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:45,823
What's going to happen to him?

104
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:51,295
The state treats thought crime
in an appropriate manner.

105
00:12:54,072 --> 00:12:56,870
You needn't be concerned.

106
00:12:59,978 --> 00:13:04,438
From that day on,
death notifications were my job.

107
00:13:05,884 --> 00:13:09,718
A job vital to
the prosperity of the state.

108
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:14,849
Honorable work, a job to be proud of.

109
00:14:19,891 --> 00:14:20,823
Fujimoto...

110
00:14:21,593 --> 00:14:22,389
Chief...

111
00:14:24,596 --> 00:14:25,494
Good morning.

112
00:14:25,697 --> 00:14:27,187
Good morning.

113
00:14:30,969 --> 00:14:33,199
January Deaths: 65

114
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,504
May they rest in peace.

115
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,938
Only 65 last month?

116
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,180
That's not many.

117
00:14:43,648 --> 00:14:46,742
Take care of this, please.

118
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,915
It's for tonight.

119
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:58,895
Make sure you deliver it.

120
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:16,342
Tanabe, Tsubasa
Time of Death: 8 p.m.

121
00:15:39,871 --> 00:15:40,701
Yes?

122
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:43,131
Excuse this late hour.

123
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:47,304
Is Tsubasa Tanabe at home?

124
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:50,976
He's not back yet. Can I help you?

125
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:03,657
This is a death notification.

126
00:16:05,063 --> 00:16:11,229
The subject is granted free
transportation, food, and lodging.

127
00:16:11,703 --> 00:16:16,367
The family will receive a pension
from the National Prosperity Fund.

128
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:21,575
However, should the subject
commit a crime...

129
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:26,476
...the pension will go
to compensate the victims.

130
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:27,583
I don't know him!

131
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:28,718
Mrs Tanabe!

132
00:16:31,122 --> 00:16:35,752
He's not my son. Go away, please.

133
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:37,986
Mrs Tanabe...

134
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:40,922
Get out.

135
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:44,993
Get out, I said!

136
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,106
I'm a single mother. He's my only son.

137
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:00,410
Please...

138
00:17:01,853 --> 00:17:04,617
Please don't kill him!

139
00:17:12,764 --> 00:17:16,928
His death will be the foundation
of national prosperity.

140
00:17:21,139 --> 00:17:24,666
May he rest in peace.

141
00:17:25,176 --> 00:17:26,575
Get out!

142
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,502
Get out, now!

143
00:17:41,726 --> 00:17:42,852
Tanabe, Tsubasa.

144
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:49,066
Time to death: 23 hours, 56 minutes.

145
00:17:50,735 --> 00:17:54,398
From this moment begins the last day...

146
00:17:55,206 --> 00:17:57,367
...in a young mars life.

147
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:17,826
Hey!

148
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,288
Play it right!

149
00:18:20,498 --> 00:18:22,659
Are you into this or not?

150
00:18:24,235 --> 00:18:25,702
I played it right.

151
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:34,068
Have you got a problem?

152
00:18:35,513 --> 00:18:37,913
Not especially.

153
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:42,978
Sorry, can we take a break?

154
00:18:53,498 --> 00:18:54,624
Your face.

155
00:18:56,534 --> 00:18:57,865
The look on it.

156
00:18:58,536 --> 00:19:00,128
Do something about it.

157
00:19:00,538 --> 00:19:04,634
Sing looking like that
and they'll leave in droves.

158
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:12,480
Like this?

159
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:17,514
Yeah. Just hold that goofy grin.

160
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,124
How did I get stuck with him?!

161
00:19:28,266 --> 00:19:29,358
Sounds good.

162
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:39,200
Hello.

163
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,108
How's it going, Tatsuhiko?

164
00:19:43,181 --> 00:19:44,375
Not too good.

165
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,677
It's Tanabe.

166
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:52,948
I'm selling you two hard.
Hang in a bit, OK?

167
00:19:53,324 --> 00:19:54,586
Tomorrow's big.

168
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:55,760
Yeah.

169
00:20:09,874 --> 00:20:10,704
Tanabe...

170
00:20:11,342 --> 00:20:12,172
Yes?

171
00:20:14,412 --> 00:20:18,872
The T-Birds' future is riding on tomorrow.

172
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:21,077
Yes.

173
00:20:23,054 --> 00:20:25,420
Live TV is tricky.

174
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:30,728
Play good and you're a star.
Mess up and you're history.

175
00:20:32,964 --> 00:20:37,298
It's Tatsuhiko's show.
You just stand there and grin.

176
00:20:42,974 --> 00:20:47,809
He's the one who's brought you this far.

177
00:20:50,448 --> 00:20:53,144
I know my place.

178
00:21:10,635 --> 00:21:11,966
I'm beat!

179
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:25,478
So, Hidekazu... what are your plans?

180
00:21:29,587 --> 00:21:32,556
What do you want to do with your life?

181
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:36,487
No plans.

182
00:21:37,395 --> 00:21:41,832
You've got to focus,
or you'll end up like me, going nowhere.

183
00:22:20,738 --> 00:22:21,864
I'm back.

184
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:30,005
Mom?

185
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:48,023
What are you doing
sitting there in the dark?

186
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:51,965
Tomorrow's our big break.

187
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:55,730
Then we'll be able to move out of here.

188
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,978
What's wrong?

189
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:18,762
Did something happen?

190
00:23:43,888 --> 00:23:45,185
This can't be right!

191
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,823
I couldn't do anything...

192
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:51,653
...but accept it.

193
00:23:53,831 --> 00:23:55,321
Yeah, but...

194
00:23:56,367 --> 00:23:58,460
...where does that leave me?

195
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:03,065
I'm sorry!

196
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:46,008
Komatsuna Live!

197
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:19,516
Thank you! That was 'Signpost',
written by Hidekazu Morio.

198
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,677
Lead vocal, Tsubasa Tanabe.

199
00:25:23,888 --> 00:25:25,048
Tsubasa!

200
00:25:31,295 --> 00:25:35,994
Hey, don't take it all!
You always do that!

201
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,464
Do you think we'll ever get our big break?

202
00:25:41,672 --> 00:25:43,833
Who knows?

203
00:25:45,476 --> 00:25:46,465
I wanna be a star!

204
00:25:46,677 --> 00:25:47,507
Careful!

205
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:50,374
You'll spill it!

206
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:54,582
Wouldn't it be great
to play in the Tokyo Dome!

207
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:56,879
50,000 people watching us!

208
00:25:57,288 --> 00:25:59,779
50,000 people going wild!

209
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:04,587
Don't spill it!
Stop day-dreaming, will you!

210
00:26:09,767 --> 00:26:12,327
'Komatsuna! ' 'Yay! '

211
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:13,469
Idiot!

212
00:26:13,671 --> 00:26:18,335
'I wanna thank you all
for coming out tonight! '

213
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:29,278
You ate the whole thing!
You took all the pork bits!

214
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:30,647
What about you?

215
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:33,221
And the bamboo shoots!

216
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:35,587
My motivations gone!

217
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,758
Excuse me...

218
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:44,596
Satake, Omega Music.

219
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:46,736
My name's Tsutsumi.

220
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,269
Thanks.

221
00:26:51,642 --> 00:26:54,372
You mean the Omega Music?

222
00:26:54,745 --> 00:26:55,439
Yes.

223
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,307
We've been hearing about you.

224
00:26:58,816 --> 00:27:02,343
Could you maybe come to our office?

225
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,879
We'd like to talk to you.

226
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:08,389
You mean it?!

227
00:27:08,993 --> 00:27:10,324
We'd love to!

228
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:11,051
Right?

229
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:12,490
Yeah!

230
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:13,862
Uh, well...

231
00:27:15,366 --> 00:27:20,497
...it's you we want to see, Mr Tanabe.

232
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,033
Just me?

233
00:28:09,987 --> 00:28:12,251
Shit!

234
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:05,103
We've never spot-lighted a new act before.

235
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:08,337
Let's hope they can light a fire.

236
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:10,776
Thank you very much.

237
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:13,210
My hopes are high.

238
00:29:13,417 --> 00:29:14,281
Right!

239
00:29:14,485 --> 00:29:15,509
Yes!

240
00:29:15,886 --> 00:29:17,114
See you, then.

241
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:31,694
Hidekazu!

242
00:29:36,707 --> 00:29:40,939
We're going to be on
'Music Bomb' next month.

243
00:29:42,346 --> 00:29:43,404
Great.

244
00:29:43,714 --> 00:29:46,239
This might be my big break.

245
00:29:47,818 --> 00:29:50,184
I'll pull you along with me.

246
00:29:52,723 --> 00:29:54,884
Didn't you sing lead?

247
00:29:57,328 --> 00:30:00,855
You're just riding
that other guy's coat-tails.

248
00:30:05,369 --> 00:30:07,633
And getting paid for it.

249
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:13,472
Isn't that better than being a coolie?

250
00:30:19,283 --> 00:30:20,944
What?

251
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,346
Hidekazu!

252
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:25,615
Come on!

253
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:20,940
Why me?!

254
00:31:22,713 --> 00:31:24,271
Tanabe, Tsubasa

255
00:31:24,815 --> 00:31:26,749
Time to death:

256
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:29,784
16 hours, 26minutes

257
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:18,825
Sacrificed yesterday: Kojima, Maki

258
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:22,965
May she rest in peace.

259
00:32:28,045 --> 00:32:32,414
The National Prosperity Law,
on a daily basis...

260
00:32:32,616 --> 00:32:37,644
...teaches us the value
and the magnificence of life.

261
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:40,016
Vote for Kazuko Takizawa!

262
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:49,966
In our schools and our homes,
we must educate for the nation!

263
00:32:50,534 --> 00:32:53,332
'For a National Education! '

264
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:03,673
Fujimoto...

265
00:33:04,982 --> 00:33:05,778
Good morning.

266
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,242
Good morning.

267
00:33:09,386 --> 00:33:12,844
Did your delivery last night go well?

268
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:14,515
Yes, sir.

269
00:33:14,725 --> 00:33:15,714
It did?

270
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:17,551
Good.

271
00:33:19,129 --> 00:33:22,587
It looks like you're getting used to this.

272
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:41,275
Chief...

273
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:43,283
Yes?

274
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:45,583
Um...

275
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:48,818
What is it?

276
00:33:51,862 --> 00:33:53,261
Should I be?

277
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:54,488
What?

278
00:33:56,433 --> 00:33:57,297
I mean...

279
00:33:57,501 --> 00:33:58,900
What do you mean?

280
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:08,234
Should I be getting used to this?

281
00:34:09,346 --> 00:34:10,745
Of course.

282
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:13,647
This is important work.

283
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:17,282
But...

284
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:18,216
But what?

285
00:34:18,422 --> 00:34:20,617
Couldn't we do more?

286
00:34:21,258 --> 00:34:24,750
To make that last day more meaningful?

287
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:26,122
Fujimoto!

288
00:34:39,543 --> 00:34:41,977
That is not for us to consider.

289
00:34:42,846 --> 00:34:47,146
Interference with a subject
is a violation of regulations.

290
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:49,084
At worst...

291
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:53,049
...it could be a thought crime.

292
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,849
Avoid unnecessary thinking.

293
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:19,182
I'm hungry.

294
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:38,126
Hello.

295
00:35:40,337 --> 00:35:42,862
Do you have a reservation?

296
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:46,434
For one, sir?

297
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:52,347
This way.

298
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:02,249
The best of everything.

299
00:36:03,994 --> 00:36:06,827
Can you pay for it, sir?

300
00:36:16,573 --> 00:36:18,131
My apologies!

301
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:50,196
Three hours late!

302
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:54,607
What's that idiot Tanabe up to?!

303
00:36:54,878 --> 00:36:56,607
Stage fright, maybe?

304
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:58,941
It's OK. I can handle it alone.

305
00:36:59,149 --> 00:37:00,673
This is serious!

306
00:37:00,884 --> 00:37:04,911
No luck.
I've looked everywhere he might be.

307
00:37:05,522 --> 00:37:06,386
Shit!

308
00:37:18,068 --> 00:37:21,401
The instant noodles tasted better.

309
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:43,013
Isn't that the guy at the TV station?

310
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:47,954
Excuse me.

311
00:38:55,532 --> 00:38:56,590
What?

312
00:38:58,435 --> 00:39:00,835
Your office said you were here.

313
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:03,195
So?

314
00:39:05,008 --> 00:39:06,771
I wanted to see you.

315
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:14,176
I wanted to apologize.

316
00:39:20,557 --> 00:39:26,496
And I wanted to sing with you again,
like before.

317
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:32,100
You came here to say that?

318
00:39:38,308 --> 00:39:38,831
I'm...

319
00:39:39,042 --> 00:39:41,033
You're playing live tonight.

320
00:39:45,115 --> 00:39:46,377
You knew?

321
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:49,408
Should you be here?

322
00:39:52,956 --> 00:39:55,618
Yeah, I'd better go.

323
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:59,488
Sorry to bother you.

324
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:09,596
If you're in the mood,
will you watch the show?

325
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,600
I'll be going for it.

326
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:33,852
Tanabe!

327
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:36,724
Where were you?!

328
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,458
Sorry. I fell asleep.

329
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:40,665
Look, damn it!

330
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:42,964
Come on and get ready!

331
00:40:43,173 --> 00:40:44,231
Smarten up!

332
00:40:44,574 --> 00:40:45,836
Here he is!

333
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,211
Thought you'd got scared.

334
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:57,410
I am scared.

335
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:01,283
Real scared.

336
00:41:21,945 --> 00:41:24,812
Sorry... may I?

337
00:41:25,582 --> 00:41:26,640
Sure, sit down.

338
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:28,340
Go ahead.

339
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:35,380
Beer.

340
00:41:37,494 --> 00:41:39,462
15 seconds to air!

341
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:42,163
Here we go...

342
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:44,424
10 seconds...

343
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,330
8, 7, 6...

344
00:41:47,537 --> 00:41:50,734
Five seconds, 4, 3...

345
00:41:54,244 --> 00:41:56,405
Music Bomb!

346
00:41:57,447 --> 00:42:02,646
We've got all kinds of guests,
all coming to you live!

347
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:07,586
A glittering two-hour line-up
packed with music and talk!

348
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:10,791
Now, let's introduce our guests.

349
00:42:10,994 --> 00:42:12,222
First...

350
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:19,892
With their million-seller 'Love',
the 'Square Pants Orchestra'!

351
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:27,603
The alluring, over-30 'R30beans'!

352
00:42:35,685 --> 00:42:37,118
Here you go.

353
00:42:42,592 --> 00:42:46,722
Making their TV debut, 'T-Birds'!

354
00:42:57,507 --> 00:42:59,941
After commercial, to MCs.

355
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:02,410
Go.

356
00:43:05,148 --> 00:43:09,812
Tonight is this duo's
first-ever TV appearance.

357
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,351
T-Birds!

358
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:14,689
Thank you.

359
00:43:34,644 --> 00:43:36,202
Shit!

360
00:43:50,894 --> 00:43:52,293
Stuff it.

361
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:16,210
Hello?

362
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,010
Hidekazu?

363
00:44:20,657 --> 00:44:23,717
Mrs Tanabe? What's wrong?

364
00:44:25,762 --> 00:44:27,889
Are you watching the show?

365
00:44:29,666 --> 00:44:30,655
No.

366
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:34,962
Watch it, OK?

367
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:39,033
It's his last big moment.

368
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:41,670
Last?

369
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,575
He got the letter.

370
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:50,750
So in a few minutes...

371
00:44:53,356 --> 00:44:56,018
Please! Watch him.

372
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:10,263
You were singing on the street?

373
00:45:10,774 --> 00:45:11,297
Yes.

374
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:13,339
Singing solo?

375
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:15,839
No, in a duo.

376
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:18,014
Not really a 'duo', was it?

377
00:45:18,448 --> 00:45:20,541
Well, uh...

378
00:45:21,618 --> 00:45:23,085
...that's right.

379
00:45:23,286 --> 00:45:26,346
I'm told you were both
sent to 'boot camp'.

380
00:45:26,556 --> 00:45:29,354
Yeah, the management
sent us away for two weeks.

381
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:33,256
About a week into it...

382
00:45:33,463 --> 00:45:38,025
...I was exhausted from
rehearsing morning till night...

383
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:42,296
...and I was fast asleep...

384
00:45:57,854 --> 00:46:00,652
So this is it?

385
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:06,027
This is how it ends?

386
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:17,171
We could go on all night,
but we're out of time.

387
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:18,841
So if you're ready...

388
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:20,373
Right!

389
00:46:23,179 --> 00:46:27,081
This is a song they wrote
at that 'boot camp'.

390
00:46:27,617 --> 00:46:30,108
The ideas must have been flying!

391
00:46:31,755 --> 00:46:35,191
They're all ready,
so let's hear them sing.

392
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:39,128
T-Birds, with 'Meaning'.

393
00:46:54,344 --> 00:46:55,402
Now what?

394
00:46:56,479 --> 00:46:57,309
Hey!

395
00:46:57,514 --> 00:46:58,947
What's going on?!

396
00:47:13,396 --> 00:47:14,624
I'd like...

397
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:24,234
For my last song,
I'd like to sing this one.

398
00:47:26,209 --> 00:47:30,077
'Signpost', by Komatsuna.

399
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:53,668
Soon my birthday...

400
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:57,033
Will come round...

401
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:00,175
Just another candle.

402
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:06,316
My heart is torn trying to balance...

403
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:10,342
The things that push on me...

404
00:48:10,553 --> 00:48:13,147
'From all sides.'

405
00:48:15,091 --> 00:48:16,922
Cut to a commercial!

406
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,388
He's nuts!

407
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:20,859
Get his manager!

408
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:26,460
A commercial!

409
00:48:26,669 --> 00:48:27,658
Quiet!

410
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:37,178
Kill all the lights except for the spot.

411
00:48:48,324 --> 00:48:54,661
A signpost to now is what everyone's...

412
00:48:54,864 --> 00:49:00,564
...looking for.

413
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:08,038
What is this thing called "being alive"?

414
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:11,807
Fighting?

415
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:15,010
Or staying out of fights?

416
00:49:15,218 --> 00:49:21,214
What is this thing called "right"?

417
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:25,227
Not being wrong?

418
00:49:25,495 --> 00:49:30,262
Or not losing track?

419
00:49:36,339 --> 00:49:39,274
I want tears to age me...

420
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:42,873
Laughter to grow lines on my face...

421
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:49,475
With my love I want
my back to bend under a weight...

422
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:55,352
To be so happy it's painful...

423
00:49:56,459 --> 00:50:02,056
To be so happy it's painful...

424
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,629
In spite of that, because of that...

425
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:16,704
...the time to forget will come.

426
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:23,678
What is this thing called "gentleness"?

427
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:27,654
To forgive?

428
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,751
Or to stand firm?

429
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:37,058
What is this thing called "love"?

430
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:40,798
Just consideration?

431
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:45,872
Or concealing a doubting heart?

432
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:04,618
I want to lose to the rain...

433
00:51:05,428 --> 00:51:08,886
And lose to the wind, but...

434
00:51:09,098 --> 00:51:18,803
I will always point the way.

435
00:51:23,446 --> 00:51:29,407
What is this thing called "being alive"?

436
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:33,453
Fighting?

437
00:51:33,957 --> 00:51:36,517
Or protecting?

438
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:42,756
Every step I take now...

439
00:51:43,833 --> 00:51:46,666
...will not be toward death...

440
00:51:46,936 --> 00:51:49,905
...but toward life.

441
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:57,012
Every word I sing now...

442
00:51:57,313 --> 00:51:59,781
...embarrassing as it may be...

443
00:52:00,116 --> 00:52:05,281
...will be aimed at people's hearts...

444
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:11,890
...and be my...

445
00:52:12,762 --> 00:52:22,000
...signpost.'

446
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:28,260
Tsubasa Tanabe died at his appointed time.

447
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:34,143
He was 23.

448
00:54:24,694 --> 00:54:31,566
Last night another young man
gave up his life on live TV.

449
00:54:32,201 --> 00:54:36,535
His song brought tears to my eyes.

450
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:39,571
The sight of that beautiful death...

451
00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:45,271
...reminded me again
how important life really is.

452
00:54:45,915 --> 00:54:51,717
This is the hope the National
Prosperity Law kindles in us!

453
00:54:53,956 --> 00:54:58,893
Help me win this election!
Vote Kazuko Takizawa!

454
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:02,590
Please give me your vote!

455
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:08,027
National Prosperity Victim
Sings Plea For Life

456
00:55:12,708 --> 00:55:13,504
Chief...

457
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:17,212
My report on Tsubasa Tanabe.

458
00:55:23,586 --> 00:55:27,682
That song seems to have brought
a high viewer response.

459
00:55:30,693 --> 00:55:36,529
If he'd released it earlier,
he'd have been a star sooner.

460
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:40,061
I wonder about that.

461
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:43,466
What do you mean?

462
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:50,445
I suspect when he was singing
that song at the end...

463
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:54,776
...he was fully alive
for the first time in his life.

464
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,813
What made that song shine...

465
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:03,850
...was your ikigami.

466
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,793
I don't want to think that.

467
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:17,070
Say no more.

468
00:56:22,011 --> 00:56:25,105
Everyone loves melodrama.

469
00:56:26,415 --> 00:56:31,284
There are even people
who grow rich selling it.

470
00:56:32,521 --> 00:56:34,853
Amazing, isn't it.

471
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:57,543
Hey, Mom...

472
00:56:58,314 --> 00:57:00,111
...where's our next trip?

473
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:02,577
New Year's, maybe?

474
00:57:03,252 --> 00:57:06,483
Not till then? I can't wait that long!

475
00:57:06,689 --> 00:57:08,987
Don't be selfish, Satoshi.

476
00:57:09,191 --> 00:57:10,351
But Mom!

477
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:12,959
Sit back! You'll get hurt.

478
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:14,387
Oh, OK...

479
00:57:30,813 --> 00:57:32,713
Dad?

480
00:57:34,817 --> 00:57:36,580
Mom?

481
00:57:38,187 --> 00:57:39,677
Satoshi?

482
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,057
Satoshi?

483
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,190
Satoshi?

484
00:57:53,169 --> 00:57:54,568
Satoshi!

485
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:18,157
'Morning, Sakura.

486
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:20,329
Good morning.

487
00:58:20,529 --> 00:58:22,895
- 'Morning! - 'Morning!

488
00:58:45,988 --> 00:58:47,615
Ten more minutes.

489
00:58:49,625 --> 00:58:52,617
The country is short of donors.

490
00:58:53,596 --> 00:58:56,929
I don't know when your turn will come.

491
00:58:59,468 --> 00:59:00,958
I see...

492
00:59:01,971 --> 00:59:03,700
You'll have to be patient.

493
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:07,735
Hang in there, Sakura.

494
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:19,521
There's Sakura!

495
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:21,882
I'm back.

496
00:59:24,827 --> 00:59:25,885
Sakura!

497
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:30,294
You have a visitor!

498
00:59:31,767 --> 00:59:32,859
Hi, Sakura!

499
00:59:33,836 --> 00:59:36,532
Satoshi? What brings you here?

500
00:59:38,774 --> 00:59:40,765
Come and sit down.

501
00:59:48,851 --> 00:59:52,378
Your brother wants you
to go live with him.

502
00:59:52,655 --> 00:59:57,558
It's taken a while,
but finally I'm making enough money.

503
00:59:57,993 --> 01:00:01,053
I'm looking for an apartment for us.

504
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:04,061
Isn't that nice, Sakura!

505
01:00:05,267 --> 01:00:11,172
Now you two can combine your strengths.

506
01:00:11,373 --> 01:00:14,069
Is this OK, Satoshi?

507
01:00:14,376 --> 01:00:15,104
What?

508
01:00:15,611 --> 01:00:16,908
Can you do this?

509
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:19,274
Sure I can!

510
01:00:20,449 --> 01:00:23,714
The company's doing well,
and I'm making good money.

511
01:00:23,986 --> 01:00:27,444
Enough to support you.

512
01:00:28,624 --> 01:00:32,185
You've always been a big talker.

513
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:35,324
You said you worked for a big company.

514
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:40,299
Then you were arrested for selling
phony 'spirit urns'.

515
01:00:40,736 --> 01:00:42,727
That was ages ago!

516
01:00:43,105 --> 01:00:46,040
I've changed my ways.

517
01:00:47,576 --> 01:00:53,105
The director says your marks
are good enough for university.

518
01:00:53,516 --> 01:00:54,983
Impossible.

519
01:00:55,184 --> 01:00:57,709
No, it's not! You're smart, unlike me.

520
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,951
I'll manage the fees.

521
01:01:02,925 --> 01:01:07,726
Go to university. We'll find a donor,
and then you'll see again.

522
01:01:11,967 --> 01:01:12,934
Satoshi...

523
01:01:16,038 --> 01:01:19,269
...I don't mind staying as I am.

524
01:01:20,442 --> 01:01:21,602
What?!

525
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:28,212
To tell the truth,
being able to see scares me a little.

526
01:01:29,418 --> 01:01:30,214
Why?

527
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:38,083
Now I imagine everything
based on what little I remember...

528
01:01:38,961 --> 01:01:42,055
...from when I was small.

529
01:01:43,299 --> 01:01:48,032
Your face, my face,
all I can do is imagine them.

530
01:01:50,606 --> 01:01:55,043
But what happens
if the reality is different?

531
01:01:55,244 --> 01:01:57,940
What, are you crazy?

532
01:01:58,647 --> 01:02:03,710
Although seeing your face
in a mirror might be a shock.

533
01:02:04,687 --> 01:02:07,679
Am I really that ugly?

534
01:02:08,324 --> 01:02:09,621
I'm kidding.

535
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:11,215
Oh, you!
