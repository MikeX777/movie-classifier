1
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,700
Barbara, not a word.
I know he's there.

2
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,876
The genius.
And I do know what you're doing.

3
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,939
I need to speak to him.
Now.

4
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,300
Immediately. Understood?

5
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,196
Where would you be without
the paper?

6
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,716
Isn't it the paper - or ME in fact -
that gave you those assignments?

7
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,996
Printed and published your crap.
Looking after you for five years.

8
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,315
And they give you a price. An honor prize.
And which one? The Daily paper prize.

9
00:01:15,399 --> 00:01:17,876
Who created that prize?
The paper!

10
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,127
And then suddenly you're a damn
genius.

11
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,675
Then you loose interest in the paper.
Then you want a leave.

12
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,235
A leave? Do you think this is
the Danish public media. We run a paper!

13
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:34,916
You are a fist fighting, horny,
part time drinker just like the rest.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,876
- If you think you can have a leave...
- I don't want a leave.

15
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,675
Only regular employees get leaves.
I am a freelance journalist.

16
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:46,876
You are a devil. You are neither
freelance nor fully employed.

17
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,675
You're fired, understood?
From now on.

18
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,076
You need to return the advance,
you picked up. And get out of my office!

19
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,716
We have a paper to run here.
Shit!

20
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,716
You are pushing him. Are you
completely broke?

21
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,395
- I got that prize, you know.
- 15,000.

22
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,396
- And then IRS payed a visit.
- And?

23
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:10,355
- There's still some left for a vacation.
- Two things I don't understand.

24
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:14,760
- Just two?
- Why do you absolutely have to go?

25
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:20,276
This city is not the same without you.
And, why are you going alone?

26
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,909
I need someone to come home to.
So long.

27
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,920
By the way...
Please get the sofa fixed.

28
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:38,490
It's a racket.

29
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,420
- Where are you going?
- I don't know...

30
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,475
- Greece, perhaps.
- Don't you need a camera?

31
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:28,290
- I already have a Nikon. Brand new.
- I would go to Lesbos.

32
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:32,529
- Obviously.
- You don't have to be gay.

33
00:03:32,999 --> 00:03:34,469
Lets roll dice.

34
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:40,879
Hello.

35
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,460
Hi.
So the paper let you go.

36
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:54,460
- How do you know that?
- We know everything here.

37
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:03,950
- I had some insider info for you.
- Well...What was it?

38
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,716
They say, that something big is coming.

39
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,800
Something big?
What is something big?

40
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:16,149
- You know...
- Drugs? Hard drugs?

41
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:20,729
- Yes, so they say.
- Who says so?

42
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,299
Who has something big coming?

43
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:31,210
Unbelievable. We all know it all.

44
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,116
Except for the things, that are
really worth knowing.

45
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,476
- You owe me 110.
- Keep it in mind, Kurt.

46
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,810
Write it down for next time.
Be careful and you don't forget it.

47
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,315
- You go to the airport?
- What should I do there?

48
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:52,515
They say you are leaving.
I can give you a ride.

49
00:04:52,599 --> 00:04:54,599
No. I'm just going home.

50
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,180
Come on, sweet children.

51
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:30,690
Yes? Oh, it's you?

52
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:39,395
Would you mind putting that out?
It's not good for me.

53
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:41,511
Thanks.

54
00:05:42,001 --> 00:05:46,437
It's about the first edition. Edgar
Allan Poe. You remember, don't you?

55
00:05:46,521 --> 00:05:50,001
It just left with Mr. Rosenbaum.

56
00:05:50,681 --> 00:05:53,980
It was Rosenbaum. I forgot that
name.

57
00:05:54,641 --> 00:06:00,141
- You promised to keep it for me.
- That was nearly four month ago.

58
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:02,756
I need to live as well.
At least for a while.

59
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,037
- Isn't Rosanbaum an old drug lord?
- That was long ago.

60
00:06:07,121 --> 00:06:10,288
Others, much more powerful, have come.

61
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,716
They don't come here. Don't
even live in the neighborhood.

62
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,884
- The Thin man.
- They live in Gentofte, and such.

63
00:06:18,241 --> 00:06:24,075
I'm so sorry about that book.
May I at least offer you a glass of port?

64
00:06:25,801 --> 00:06:31,968
Rosenbaum needed a present for young
friend. I have an exquisite, old wine.

65
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:36,932
Almost as old as you.

66
00:06:37,721 --> 00:06:43,872
If I let it, it could be as old as
me. But I don't.

67
00:06:44,962 --> 00:06:46,822
Please sit down.

68
00:06:48,522 --> 00:06:50,241
Here we go.

69
00:06:52,242 --> 00:06:53,963
That's it.

70
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:59,119
You are a writer.
And a fine one if I may say so?

71
00:06:59,203 --> 00:07:01,718
What are you currently working on?

72
00:07:01,802 --> 00:07:06,792
- I have just been let go.
- I see... I see...

73
00:07:07,683 --> 00:07:10,943
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

74
00:07:18,722 --> 00:07:22,513
- Is that wise?
- Wise? Who?

75
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:27,319
- What are you going to do now?
- I don't know...travel, perhaps.

76
00:07:27,403 --> 00:07:29,653
Travel? I see.
Go away?

77
00:07:30,163 --> 00:07:33,279
- Sometimes that's what you need.
- Perhaps so.

78
00:07:33,363 --> 00:07:37,839
Once in a while it just gets too
much. Violence... Death.

79
00:07:37,923 --> 00:07:41,159
And in addition serving it as
lunch break entertainment.

80
00:07:41,243 --> 00:07:45,240
- It just gets too much sometimes.
- Well... You are still young.

81
00:07:45,324 --> 00:07:48,600
- Hi... I didn't know...
- Come on inside.

82
00:07:48,684 --> 00:07:53,434
- This is my niece, Hanne.
- Hi Hanne. We know each other.

83
00:07:54,124 --> 00:07:56,541
- Oh yes.
- I'll be off again.

84
00:07:56,764 --> 00:07:58,723
- Sorry.
- No problem.

85
00:07:59,204 --> 00:08:01,921
Wanna eat something?
I'm making eggs.

86
00:08:02,005 --> 00:08:04,760
I'm off again.
It wasn't important.

87
00:08:04,844 --> 00:08:08,844
Say hi to Ole. Tell him I'll be
with him tonight.

88
00:08:21,924 --> 00:08:24,341
She is my sisters grandchild.

89
00:08:24,645 --> 00:08:29,080
They live in Vejle. I don't know
why they let her move.

90
00:08:29,164 --> 00:08:34,414
They don't know the neighborhood.
She needs to be taken care of.

91
00:08:35,165 --> 00:08:39,332
- I suppose Ole chef takes care of her.
- Ole chef?

92
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:44,482
Who is taking care of him, then?
Would you like another glass?

93
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:49,765
No, thank you, Bille.
Let it age.

94
00:09:04,716 --> 00:09:07,883
- When are you going?
- I don't know...

95
00:09:08,475 --> 00:09:12,476
I would like to go too. To Vejle.

96
00:09:13,236 --> 00:09:16,787
- Vejle?
- You know, Hanne is from Vejle.

97
00:09:17,476 --> 00:09:21,152
It would do her good to come home
to her family again.

98
00:09:21,236 --> 00:09:25,736
There is a small bar in Vejle. It
would like to buy it.

99
00:09:26,157 --> 00:09:30,266
If only I could raise the money.
Are you ready?

100
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,220
- God, what time is it?
- 2:30.

101
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,752
Shit, is it that late?
We better...

102
00:11:04,403 --> 00:11:07,962
- Don't you want to listen to the tape?
- No. Tomorrow is better.

103
00:11:08,046 --> 00:11:13,796
- I have to clean this place up.
- Do you have any appointments? Okay.

104
00:11:49,991 --> 00:11:53,109
- Who is it?
- That's none of your business.

105
00:11:53,193 --> 00:11:55,271
- Where's the Colonel.
- Sick.

106
00:11:55,355 --> 00:11:57,711
Let's go. We don't have
all night.

107
00:11:57,795 --> 00:12:02,129
Come on then.
And the curiosity is unhealthy for you.

108
00:12:02,318 --> 00:12:08,222
Yes, of course. I just wanted...
There is quite a lot in here.

109
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,988
Here.

110
00:12:51,989 --> 00:12:55,611
I usually get a...a sample.

111
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,607
- Did you get anything?
- Yes, right here.

112
00:13:29,691 --> 00:13:34,731
- That's fine. Give it to me.
- Don't you want to go home first?

113
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:39,347
No, come on.
Give it to me. Come on.

114
00:14:12,038 --> 00:14:14,115
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

115
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:20,872
The new detective has arrived.
And this just came from Heegaards Gade.

116
00:14:24,926 --> 00:14:27,597
Any coffee left?

117
00:14:34,731 --> 00:14:37,048
- Good morning...Ehlers.
- Kaspersen.

118
00:14:37,132 --> 00:14:41,372
Welcome to Copenhagen.
You arrived from Aarhus? Recently?

119
00:14:41,456 --> 00:14:43,692
- Last week.
- Found a place to stay?

120
00:14:43,776 --> 00:14:46,860
In Broenshoej.
At my sisters. For now.

121
00:14:46,979 --> 00:14:50,740
- Sit down. Married?
- Used to be.

122
00:14:51,462 --> 00:14:54,100
Thanks. What do you know about
this neighborhood?

123
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:58,535
Well, you pick up bits of
information here and there.

124
00:14:59,347 --> 00:15:04,585
It's all true. We have more bars and
nightclubs than anywhere else.

125
00:15:04,669 --> 00:15:09,336
More brothels, prostitutes and pushers
than any precinct.

126
00:15:09,473 --> 00:15:13,992
Then, there's the regular people,
shoppers, kindergartens, the retireds.

127
00:15:14,076 --> 00:15:19,993
- There is plenty to look after.
- Yes. And we are heavily understaffed.

128
00:15:20,439 --> 00:15:25,532
Half of us is in bed with the flu.
And then, this came in.

129
00:15:26,442 --> 00:15:29,859
The riot squad wants us on a
raid tonight.

130
00:15:30,326 --> 00:15:33,243
They believe a load of
drugs just arrived.

131
00:15:33,327 --> 00:15:37,406
The market has been undersupplied.
Tag along and meet the neighborhood.

132
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:41,112
- Yes please.
- You're welcome. Welcome!

133
00:16:19,795 --> 00:16:24,077
That's a boy. Come on my children.

134
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:53,928
- Let me give you a hand.
- Alright, pour us a drink.

135
00:17:54,012 --> 00:17:57,346
Put on a record. I'll make us
some lunch.

136
00:18:22,631 --> 00:18:25,789
- Do you want to sleep with me?
- What?

137
00:18:25,873 --> 00:18:29,111
- I'll sleep with you.
- Now I'm making us a little lunch.

138
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:33,336
- Ole doesn't mind.
- Please sit down and relax.

139
00:18:34,117 --> 00:18:37,239
You need something to eat.

140
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:55,547
- Is it true you are leaving?
- Yes, maybe.

141
00:18:55,691 --> 00:18:58,672
Perhaps we are too. Ole and me.

142
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:03,010
Ole says he's making enough money
for us to go to Vejle.

143
00:19:03,094 --> 00:19:07,027
- That sounds good.
- Where are you going?

144
00:19:07,777 --> 00:19:11,470
- Greece, perhaps.
- I've been there.

145
00:19:12,181 --> 00:19:14,257
Lovely. Very clean and such.

146
00:19:14,341 --> 00:19:17,180
- Ever been there?
- No, but it sounds good.

147
00:19:17,264 --> 00:19:20,514
How long is it since you were
in Greece?

148
00:20:21,582 --> 00:20:23,304
Cheers!

149
00:20:29,387 --> 00:20:32,300
- Taxi!
- Take it ease, there.

150
00:20:56,884 --> 00:20:59,202
- Hello?
- Is it the director?

151
00:20:59,286 --> 00:21:01,843
- Who am I talking to?
- This is Rosenbaum.

152
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:05,845
- Is it the director?
- What do you want at this hour?

153
00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:10,112
Oh, it's the director. I recognize
the voice.

154
00:21:10,892 --> 00:21:15,915
- You can also recognize it from a tape.
- Tape? What tape?

155
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:20,614
Why are you acting like a big shot, idiot?
Have you got any more money?

156
00:21:20,698 --> 00:21:26,615
- Hey! Do you have more money?
- Let's have some peace and quiet please.

157
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:29,460
It's more than 4000.
It's the worlds best.

158
00:21:29,544 --> 00:21:31,821
- Has it a timer function?
- Sure.

159
00:21:31,905 --> 00:21:34,342
Shit man, this is the top of the line.

160
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:39,105
- If there is no timer...
- Come on man, you'll get for 1200.

161
00:21:39,189 --> 00:21:44,182
- Let's roll a die.
- You still owe me, man.

162
00:21:45,074 --> 00:21:47,871
Add it, write it down, for Christ's
sake.

163
00:21:47,955 --> 00:21:51,187
Don't ever forget to keep
accounts.

164
00:21:51,838 --> 00:21:54,119
We have some visitors.

165
00:21:54,639 --> 00:21:56,781
- Visitors!
- Shit.

166
00:21:58,362 --> 00:22:00,682
You owe me damn it...

167
00:22:01,203 --> 00:22:05,526
Police! Please keep quiet. Hands
above the table.

168
00:22:06,327 --> 00:22:08,803
Hands above the table, please.

169
00:22:08,887 --> 00:22:12,137
That's enough. Get him out.
Kaspersen...

170
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:17,240
This is too much. You can't even
go to the toilet anymore.

171
00:22:17,854 --> 00:22:20,438
- This way, madam.
- Oh, please.

172
00:22:20,776 --> 00:22:22,852
Ah, look what we have here?

173
00:22:22,936 --> 00:22:27,175
Kaspersen, please let me introduce
one of the neighborhood attractions.

174
00:22:27,259 --> 00:22:29,896
This bright, young genius, here.
Denmark's hope.

175
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,011
A brawler and drunk.

176
00:22:32,502 --> 00:22:35,981
Journalist, prize winner.
Do you know, why he won?

177
00:22:36,065 --> 00:22:40,944
A series of articles about
the police' inability at Vesterbro.

178
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:45,947
He serves naked women,
blood, violence and social misery -

179
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,633
- as lunch break entertainment.

180
00:22:50,073 --> 00:22:53,990
No, what have we here? Nice,
a brand new camera.

181
00:22:54,116 --> 00:22:59,879
Where did we buy that? Do we have
a receipt? An invoice?

182
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,357
No, perhaps not here. Bring it to
the station -

183
00:23:04,441 --> 00:23:08,840
- we'll take care of the camera until then.
We'd hate for something to happen to it.

184
00:23:08,924 --> 00:23:11,275
He's okay.
We're closing now.

185
00:23:22,613 --> 00:23:27,636
What is this shit? I didn't do
anything wrong.

186
00:23:33,939 --> 00:23:38,689
It's Bob. We just had visitors.
I noticed they took Hanne.

187
00:23:40,543 --> 00:23:44,377
Yes, he's here. Ole chef wants
a word with you.

188
00:23:44,986 --> 00:23:48,345
- He wants to know if you drop by?
- I'm too tired.

189
00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:51,270
He says he's broiling a steak.

190
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:03,027
Sounds like shit!

191
00:24:03,537 --> 00:24:05,371
I'm much too hammered.

192
00:24:05,739 --> 00:24:09,417
Why don't we listen to that tape?
It's terrific.

193
00:24:09,501 --> 00:24:12,340
- Where is the tape?
- I don't have it here.

194
00:24:12,424 --> 00:24:16,102
Stop doing that! I need to tell
you something about the tape.

195
00:24:16,186 --> 00:24:17,907
Okay.

196
00:24:18,347 --> 00:24:23,764
I'll make crisp onions, right?
You don't appreciate the soft ones.

197
00:24:24,591 --> 00:24:28,590
- I absolutely hate soft onion rings.
- You're an odd bugger.

198
00:24:28,674 --> 00:24:33,525
Everyone loves soft onion rings.
I'll just fry them a bit.

199
00:24:34,397 --> 00:24:40,156
You see, the other day, when we were
finished playing, and you'd gone -

200
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,990
- they came to pick up the goods.
Someone was here I didn't recognize.

201
00:24:46,843 --> 00:24:52,482
The others said he was here, because
the regular guy had caught the flu.

202
00:24:52,566 --> 00:24:56,816
He didn't say much. The others
were scared shitless.

203
00:24:57,489 --> 00:25:02,728
When they were gone, I noticed,
that the tape recorder was rolling.

204
00:25:02,812 --> 00:25:06,331
It had recorded everything. I didn't
know what to do.

205
00:25:06,415 --> 00:25:11,749
But then Rosenbaum came by, and
he knows the business inside out.

206
00:25:12,297 --> 00:25:17,810
I played the tape for him, and he
said it was the Thin man.

207
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:22,859
He was absolutely certain. He was
dying to hold on to that tape.

208
00:25:22,943 --> 00:25:26,260
It was obvious to Rosenbaum. But
I kept the tape.

209
00:25:26,344 --> 00:25:28,761
It has to be worth something.

210
00:25:29,066 --> 00:25:33,385
No one was ever able to proof
anything against the Thin man.

211
00:25:33,469 --> 00:25:35,890
It has to be worth something.

212
00:25:36,431 --> 00:25:40,188
The police doesn't pay anything
for that sort of thing.

213
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:45,785
I'm afraid to call the Thin man.
Rosenbaum told me he would pay.

214
00:25:46,756 --> 00:25:50,006
It's just not me. I'm simply too
scared.

215
00:25:52,999 --> 00:25:55,917
I suppose there is a good story
in it, right?

216
00:25:56,001 --> 00:26:00,519
Obviously they'll arrest me. But
I'll get out sooner or later.

217
00:26:00,603 --> 00:26:03,935
And then we could go to Vejle.
Right?

218
00:26:05,285 --> 00:26:07,776
How does that sound?

219
00:26:16,652 --> 00:26:19,319
What the hell, are you sleeping?

220
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:21,415
Are you sleeping?

221
00:26:21,894 --> 00:26:24,456
I must have dozed off.

222
00:26:27,738 --> 00:26:30,735
- What is that?
- It's a steak with onions.

223
00:26:30,819 --> 00:26:34,891
I can't stomach those soft onions.
I have to...

224
00:26:36,703 --> 00:26:40,287
It's not bloody soft onions.
They are crisp.

225
00:26:54,753 --> 00:26:56,829
I have to get some fresh air.

226
00:26:56,913 --> 00:27:01,266
Those bloody Greeks. Mixing
various drinks.

227
00:27:02,075 --> 00:27:05,798
I walking sideways. I'll be back
tomorrow.

228
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:08,480
Let's play, then.

229
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:19,946
I'm sorry about the steaks.

230
00:27:20,686 --> 00:27:23,357
Don't worry about the steaks.

231
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:08,628
When he realized what was going to
happen, he got scared.

232
00:28:08,712 --> 00:28:12,230
He looked at me. I'll never forget
his eyes.

233
00:28:12,314 --> 00:28:15,791
That's why I'm coming. I always
see those eyes.

234
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:18,272
Frandsen, you need to listen to me.

235
00:28:18,356 --> 00:28:23,030
Then, I forced his head backwards
and cut his throat.

236
00:28:23,879 --> 00:28:27,998
It's best that way. That way there are
no sounds from the throat.

237
00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:31,916
- In the Resistance we were taught that.
- Yes?

238
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:36,528
But there was an awful lot of blood.
An awful lot.

239
00:28:36,646 --> 00:28:42,313
- Frandsen, you need to listen to me.
- Absalonsgade 15 B, 3rd floor.

240
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:46,532
- By these hands...
- And what was the name?

241
00:28:47,293 --> 00:28:51,293
Rosenbaum, I got that one.
But what is your name?

242
00:28:51,934 --> 00:28:56,601
That's good. We'll be there.
Please don't touch anything.

243
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:05,218
Come on, Simonsen. It's the same each month.
You come here with the same confession.

244
00:29:05,302 --> 00:29:08,469
Why don't you come up with a new
story?

245
00:29:14,426 --> 00:29:17,985
We have a report of a homicide
in Absalonsgade.

246
00:29:18,069 --> 00:29:21,650
It's Fritz Rosenbaum.
Old drug lord.

247
00:29:22,352 --> 00:29:26,269
In that sort of cases, Ehlers
wants to be woken.

248
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:38,395
- Yes?
- It's me. Can we talk about it?

249
00:29:38,479 --> 00:29:40,896
Half the staff's got the flu.

250
00:29:41,122 --> 00:29:43,638
There are two homicides
near your place.

251
00:29:43,722 --> 00:29:46,119
- Both Borch and Georg is down.
- Well...

252
00:29:46,203 --> 00:29:51,547
Alright. I accept, you're freelance.
I'm giving you double up.

253
00:29:52,487 --> 00:29:57,767
This is a great story. You wouldn't
let the paper down, would you?

254
00:29:57,851 --> 00:30:00,351
I already sent a photographer.

255
00:30:02,293 --> 00:30:04,294
Come on...

256
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:18,792
- Good morning.
- Jesus.

257
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:28,703
That was no God damn photographer.
That was the police.

258
00:30:28,787 --> 00:30:32,758
- Fuck me.
- Shit!

259
00:30:38,992 --> 00:30:42,389
- It's 7.42, and you are under arrest.
- For what exactly?

260
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:47,273
We need to question you further
regarding the circumstances of a homicide.

261
00:30:47,357 --> 00:30:49,497
Murder? Me?

262
00:30:49,997 --> 00:30:52,996
It was committed between 1 and 2
tonight.

263
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,830
- On who?
- You need to follow us.

264
00:31:25,357 --> 00:31:30,635
The only encouraging about this dirty
affair is making you classy acquaintance.

265
00:31:30,719 --> 00:31:35,462
Fuck you and give me an explanation.
No stupid jokes.

266
00:31:41,126 --> 00:31:46,004
Okay, your fingerprints were all over
the place. You forgot you saxophone.

267
00:31:46,088 --> 00:31:50,886
And when we ran into you earlier at
the evening you didn't seem quite sensible.

268
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:54,554
- What are you talking about?
- Cafe Freden.

269
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:59,562
Ole Wilhelm Jensen was murdered
last night at Café Freden.

270
00:31:59,735 --> 00:32:03,388
- Ole chef?
- Yes, Ole chef.

271
00:32:06,379 --> 00:32:09,260
Ehlers.
I supposed that's right.

272
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:15,219
Are you realizing he's on an important
job for the paper. We can't just sit around.

273
00:32:15,303 --> 00:32:19,421
- As long as you know what you're doing.
- We are interrogating the suspects.

274
00:32:19,505 --> 00:32:21,922
The suspects?
Give me a break.

275
00:32:22,188 --> 00:32:25,745
I've called National Court Attorney
Jan Berentsen.

276
00:32:25,829 --> 00:32:31,069
If you want to waste his time, go ahead.
But right now you are wasting mine.

277
00:32:31,153 --> 00:32:36,775
Bring the genius for a report.
Do it thoroughly and by the book.

278
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:50,508
I already explained that to you.

279
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:57,883
Let's take it one more time.
Perhaps you'll remember something new.

280
00:32:57,967 --> 00:33:00,723
You were quite drunk.
We saw that ourselves.

281
00:33:00,807 --> 00:33:06,431
Not in my wildest dream am I
able to kill Ole. He was my friend.

282
00:33:07,412 --> 00:33:11,579
We were best friends. Why would
I want to kill him?

283
00:33:12,094 --> 00:33:14,555
Idiot.

284
00:33:16,096 --> 00:33:19,596
You also knew Ole Wilhelm Jensen's
partner.

285
00:33:20,179 --> 00:33:22,349
Hanne Margrethe Jespersen.

286
00:33:22,859 --> 00:33:25,742
She's an addict and a prostitute.

287
00:33:26,341 --> 00:33:30,523
How intimate do you know her?

288
00:33:31,304 --> 00:33:36,928
Perhaps Ole chef was dissatisfied
that you and her...

289
00:33:37,908 --> 00:33:41,908
Come on, guys. You don't
understand a damn thing.

290
00:33:43,871 --> 00:33:47,429
We believe that Ole Wilhelm Jensen
was pushing drugs.

291
00:33:47,513 --> 00:33:50,750
- And that he had access to...
- Excuse me for a second.

292
00:33:50,834 --> 00:33:54,584
This is ridiculous.
You assume. You believe...

293
00:33:54,917 --> 00:33:58,667
Bullshit! You neither need assume
nor believe.

294
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,597
You know as well as I do.
We all know -

295
00:34:01,681 --> 00:34:05,359
- who does that sort of business
around here. The thin man, right?

296
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:07,693
He has perfect conditions -

297
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:13,754
- as long as the police keeps wasting
time in this ridiculous fashion.

298
00:34:29,336 --> 00:34:31,727
It's the ink color.

299
00:34:42,503 --> 00:34:44,533
Excuse me for a second.

300
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:19,070
It's a vcr and a stereo.

301
00:35:20,041 --> 00:35:23,237
I just need to ask. Did they
vandalize anything?

302
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:25,557
- They went down...
- Besides that?

303
00:35:25,641 --> 00:35:28,971
- Goodbye.
- Yes...

304
00:36:06,818 --> 00:36:09,068
"The police is lost again."

305
00:36:28,972 --> 00:36:33,288
Go home and sleep. Sometimes things
get a little out of hand.

306
00:36:33,372 --> 00:36:37,583
- I never realized...
- Imagine the boldness.

307
00:36:38,373 --> 00:36:42,330
But he's not getting away with it.
You two find him.

308
00:36:42,414 --> 00:36:45,770
He's either in the neighborhood or
at the paper.

309
00:36:45,854 --> 00:36:48,891
- Attorney Jan Berentsen.
- Just let him in.

310
00:36:48,975 --> 00:36:51,225
It'll be a pleasure.

311
00:36:51,734 --> 00:36:56,818
- Shall we drive to his apartment?
- No. He's not that stupid.

312
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:31,492
- Who gets there first?
- I do.

313
00:39:46,025 --> 00:39:49,223
- HS-HS, reporting. 010, over.
- 010, come in,

314
00:39:49,307 --> 00:39:53,502
We have identified the suspect in
Istedgade just outside number 13.

315
00:39:53,586 --> 00:39:56,744
We pursue him and attempt arrest.
010, over.

316
00:39:56,828 --> 00:39:58,578
O10, copy, out,

317
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:38,230
HS-HS, the suspect escaped via
the backyard to Istedgade 14 -

318
00:40:38,314 --> 00:40:41,645
- and we call for backup.

319
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:46,385
- 010, 011 and 012 are coming.
- Copy. 010, over.

320
00:41:42,445 --> 00:41:46,275
- HS, reporting. 6501, over.
- Come in.

321
00:41:48,685 --> 00:41:53,685
We have identified the suspect.
We pursue and attempt arrest.

322
00:42:03,528 --> 00:42:06,644
Nah, we haven't seen him
the last couple of days.

323
00:42:06,728 --> 00:42:09,684
He's probably left.
Wasn't he on vacation?

324
00:42:09,768 --> 00:42:14,518
- Oh, yeah. He's left.
- Wasn't it something about Greece?

325
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:17,144
Yes, he was going to Lesbos.

326
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:20,887
- Lesbos is a terrific place.
- That's enough.

327
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:24,721
Well, if you write him don't
forget to say hi.

328
00:42:36,732 --> 00:42:38,816
That's it.
Take that home.

329
00:42:39,253 --> 00:42:42,253
- I hope it's fine.
- It's brand new.

330
00:42:43,975 --> 00:42:47,170
- Is there a warranty?
- What do you think this is?

331
00:42:47,254 --> 00:42:52,588
- I ought to have a warranty.
- It's less than half retail price.

332
00:42:58,136 --> 00:43:02,886
- But what if something is broken?
- Not my problem is it?

333
00:43:12,539 --> 00:43:14,289
- Jesus.
- Easy, easy.

334
00:43:14,578 --> 00:43:17,376
- What do you want?
- I need a place to stay.

335
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:22,060
Not with me you are.
It's dangerous.

336
00:43:22,901 --> 00:43:26,217
The whole neighborhood is looking
for you.

337
00:43:26,301 --> 00:43:30,635
They say the Thin man wants you.
And also the police.

338
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:35,609
If I were you, I would go to
Greece. As fast as possible.

339
00:43:37,423 --> 00:43:39,742
I'm off. See you.

340
00:43:40,623 --> 00:43:44,134
- Okay. Just tell me one thing.
- What?

341
00:43:44,824 --> 00:43:49,180
- Where does the Thin man live?
- What do you want him for?

342
00:43:49,264 --> 00:43:54,326
- I need a word with him.
- You are not well, man.

343
00:44:00,146 --> 00:44:05,563
No. We have seen nothing of the Thin man,
but a taxi just arrived.

344
00:44:06,988 --> 00:44:09,944
Somebody comes out carrying
two suitcases.

345
00:44:10,028 --> 00:44:14,768
It's the Colonel. His Jaguar is
in the driveway.

346
00:44:15,628 --> 00:44:18,795
And here comes the Mrs. with
the child.

347
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:23,920
They enter the taxi.

348
00:44:24,471 --> 00:44:26,555
The Colonel stays behind.

349
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:32,388
The taxi's leaving. The Colonel
walks back to the house.

350
00:44:32,472 --> 00:44:35,348
We stay put and continue the
surveillance.

351
00:44:35,432 --> 00:44:39,108
It's the same every time something
is about to happen.

352
00:44:39,192 --> 00:44:41,909
Only God know how that man looks
inside.

353
00:44:41,993 --> 00:44:47,910
Every time it's about murder and
violence he sends the Mrs. to the country.

354
00:44:47,994 --> 00:44:51,828
Perhaps she doesn't even know
what he is doing.

355
00:44:51,915 --> 00:44:57,232
Under no circumstances is this
happening in Gentofte. Just call them back.

356
00:44:57,316 --> 00:44:59,991
- Hey. Got some sleep?
- Yes, thank you.

357
00:45:00,075 --> 00:45:04,273
- We still haven't apprehended him.
- He's a handful.

358
00:45:04,357 --> 00:45:08,633
I was thinking...I seriously doubt
that he's the killer.

359
00:45:08,717 --> 00:45:11,314
I don't care. Just find the man.

360
00:45:11,398 --> 00:45:14,232
Find him. Dead or alive. Find him!

361
00:45:18,678 --> 00:45:21,210
Hello? Hello?

362
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:27,156
- Where were you? Where are you?
- Nowhere, really. It's tiring.

363
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:31,317
- When are you going home?
- In an hour. Is that okay?

364
00:45:31,401 --> 00:45:35,542
What? A shaver?
Well, I suppose I can fix that.

365
00:45:36,322 --> 00:45:41,319
Just one more thing. Can you find
out, where the Thin man lives?

366
00:45:41,403 --> 00:45:44,439
He lives in Gentofte.
He's not in the phonebook.

367
00:45:44,523 --> 00:45:48,773
They have to know something
in the crime department.

368
00:45:54,124 --> 00:45:57,955
- Hello?
- Bille! What's going on?...

369
00:45:58,685 --> 00:46:01,176
Let me help you.

370
00:46:02,446 --> 00:46:05,327
What the hell were you thinking?

371
00:46:05,927 --> 00:46:09,677
- I'm deeply sorry.
- You're not hurt are you?

372
00:46:12,568 --> 00:46:17,318
So kind of you. It's the right
leg. It's seen better days.

373
00:46:29,931 --> 00:46:33,247
- What do you do out here?
- Looking for Hanne.

374
00:46:33,331 --> 00:46:36,448
She was arrested last night.
She's at the station.

375
00:46:36,532 --> 00:46:39,808
I'm sorry. She was released
this morning.

376
00:46:39,892 --> 00:46:44,889
Those guys, that murdered Ole chef are
tearing the town apart looking for her.

377
00:46:44,973 --> 00:46:49,729
- They are looking for you too, you know.
- It dawned on me.

378
00:46:49,813 --> 00:46:53,313
- Please let me take you home.
- Thank you.

379
00:46:55,654 --> 00:46:58,564
- Does it hurt?
- It's wear.

380
00:46:59,174 --> 00:47:01,372
The doctor says I must
live with it.

381
00:47:01,456 --> 00:47:05,146
And I suppose one has to
until it kills you.

382
00:47:05,856 --> 00:47:09,813
Oh, that's the cognac.
For a second I thought it was the port.

383
00:47:09,897 --> 00:47:13,378
No. It's aging, remember.
Where is Hanne?

384
00:47:16,657 --> 00:47:19,678
I don't know. She's hiding.

385
00:47:20,298 --> 00:47:24,382
She has a friend... Gurli.
Perhaps she's with her.

386
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:30,296
- I wonder if we'd find her there.
- Yes, maybe.

387
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:35,964
I don't know where she lives.
She's hanging around the oriental bar.

388
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:40,082
- I guess you could ask them.
- Yes, maybe.

389
00:47:40,821 --> 00:47:43,983
Yes, maybe.
Let me show you.

390
00:47:58,184 --> 00:48:02,851
Look, take this.
I've taken good care of it and it works.

391
00:48:02,986 --> 00:48:07,165
And in your current situation it
might come handy.

392
00:48:07,946 --> 00:48:10,113
Do you know how to use it?

393
00:48:10,547 --> 00:48:14,464
- Where's the other one?
- I keep it in my coat.

394
00:48:14,988 --> 00:48:18,428
You are surprised. Of course.

395
00:48:19,107 --> 00:48:22,184
I sometimes ask myself how it
all ended like this.

396
00:48:22,268 --> 00:48:27,329
I could never hurt a fly.

397
00:48:28,749 --> 00:48:31,700
I've lived here my entire life.

398
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:35,476
These children were never
God's finest.

399
00:48:35,911 --> 00:48:39,670
But they were living here.
This was a refugee.

400
00:48:40,391 --> 00:48:45,873
Unfortunately the Thin man unofficially
crowned himself king of the neighborhood -

401
00:48:45,957 --> 00:48:48,115
- and he doesn't even live here.

402
00:48:48,199 --> 00:48:53,761
Him and his gang fill the neighborhood
with evil, fear, violence and death.

403
00:48:53,845 --> 00:48:56,307
The police are helpless.

404
00:48:56,848 --> 00:49:00,932
Suddenly an old man walks about
with a loaded gun.

405
00:49:01,494 --> 00:49:05,578
And there's a price tag on a
poor girl from Vejle.

406
00:49:05,899 --> 00:49:08,399
This is literally killing her!

407
00:49:20,244 --> 00:49:24,427
- Is Gurli around?
- Don't know her. I'm sorry.

408
00:49:25,209 --> 00:49:28,862
- Gurli from Vejle.
- Oh, that Gurli.

409
00:49:29,573 --> 00:49:33,437
- She's not in yet.
- Do you have her address?

410
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:39,794
Let me just check.

411
00:50:09,937 --> 00:50:13,576
- What the hell?
- I just need a little word with you.

412
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:18,160
- Who were you calling?
- That's none of your business.

413
00:50:19,066 --> 00:50:23,251
Let's have some music.
Now, let's talk.

414
00:50:24,031 --> 00:50:26,615
What were you telling me again?

415
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:54,825
Why didn't you just say so?

416
00:51:26,537 --> 00:51:29,001
What the hell...

417
00:51:37,269 --> 00:51:41,204
- Vesterbrogade 60 C.
- Where have you been?

418
00:51:41,955 --> 00:51:45,077
They are coming for you. Everybody.

419
00:51:45,718 --> 00:51:49,622
- Have you heard about Topcat?
- Topcat?

420
00:51:50,364 --> 00:51:53,642
- It's a porn club, right?
- Why are you going there?

421
00:51:53,726 --> 00:51:57,476
Just an address I was given
by a man in a bar.

422
00:51:57,932 --> 00:51:59,963
It's not a good place.

423
00:52:00,455 --> 00:52:03,872
- It's the Colonel's place.
- The Colonel?

424
00:52:04,058 --> 00:52:06,225
The Thin man's right hand.

425
00:52:06,341 --> 00:52:08,980
It's not good place. Stay out
of there.

426
00:52:09,064 --> 00:52:11,455
Let's see.
It should be here.

427
00:52:40,296 --> 00:52:43,561
- From your country?
- Very popular.

428
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:46,854
Don't get started, now.

429
00:52:52,189 --> 00:52:54,151
It should be here.

430
00:53:25,664 --> 00:53:28,581
- What was her name, again?
- Gurli.

431
00:53:28,668 --> 00:53:31,972
Oh, Gurli?
She lives there.

432
00:53:32,633 --> 00:53:34,564
Gurli lives there.

433
00:53:40,841 --> 00:53:43,008
- Who is it?
- Is it Gurli?

434
00:53:43,243 --> 00:53:46,910
- Who's asking?
- I have a message for Hanne.

435
00:53:52,534 --> 00:53:54,784
You're the reporter, right?

436
00:53:55,177 --> 00:53:59,011
She's been out of her mind.
So I got her a fix.

437
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:01,293
She's calm now.

438
00:54:01,783 --> 00:54:05,064
I have to go. I don't want them
to get mad at me.

439
00:54:05,148 --> 00:54:10,954
- She's scared and wants to go home.
- Okay...Hanne?

440
00:54:11,955 --> 00:54:14,789
Hanne?
Come on. You are going home.

441
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:38,619
Listen, Hanne.
I'm putting you on a train to Vejle.

442
00:54:38,703 --> 00:54:43,424
- Everything is going to be fine.
- Ole said the same thing.

443
00:54:43,508 --> 00:54:47,582
By the way... Here.

444
00:54:50,435 --> 00:54:53,555
- What is it?
- The tape I was supposed to give you.

445
00:54:53,639 --> 00:54:56,522
Ole told me it was very important.

446
00:55:26,594 --> 00:55:30,178
- That was beautiful.
- You can keep it.

447
00:55:34,283 --> 00:55:39,617
- Do you want me to go inside with her?
- Just wait for me, okay?

448
00:55:48,718 --> 00:55:50,968
Copenhagen Central Station.

449
00:55:51,121 --> 00:55:55,001
Intercity train for Aarhus
leaves at 8 pm, track 5.

450
00:55:55,085 --> 00:56:01,451
The train stops at Roskilde, Korsoer,
Odense, Fredericia and Vejle.

451
00:56:33,686 --> 00:56:38,270
Do you want me to call anybody
and tell them you arrive?

452
00:56:38,611 --> 00:56:43,606
No. I'll do that myself.
I want to tell them myself.

453
00:56:45,938 --> 00:56:47,940
Okay.

454
00:56:50,344 --> 00:56:52,556
Safe journey.

455
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:01,034
- Thanks.
- So long.

456
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:14,165
Intercity train for Aarhus,
8 pm, leaves in a few minutes.

457
00:57:14,249 --> 00:57:19,666
Intercity train for Aarhus,
8 pm, leaves track 5 in a few minutes.

458
00:57:51,568 --> 00:57:53,291
Hey! Stop!

459
00:59:57,182 --> 01:00:00,182
I'm busy.
I'm waiting for a customer.

460
01:00:09,675 --> 01:00:12,238
- Where was he going?
- Who?

461
01:00:12,798 --> 01:00:15,598
- Your customer damn it.
- I don't know.

462
01:00:15,682 --> 01:00:18,516
- Go for a ride.
- No, I'm waiting.

463
01:00:19,527 --> 01:00:22,277
Just drive, you little Turk shit.

464
01:00:37,825 --> 01:00:41,129
- Well...
- Exactly.

465
01:00:44,712 --> 01:00:49,528
Hey you.
I don't want any trouble.

466
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,799
- They are looking for you.
- I just need to borrow the phone.

467
01:00:53,883 --> 01:00:57,967
Not at my place.
They came here for Ahmed as well.

468
01:00:58,247 --> 01:01:01,691
They beat him into a pulp in
Sydhavnen.

469
01:01:16,467 --> 01:01:18,259
Please open.

470
01:01:19,189 --> 01:01:21,856
- I need a drink.
- We're closed.

471
01:01:25,157 --> 01:01:26,877
Asshole.

472
01:02:21,577 --> 01:02:24,419
What's this?
My God, it's you.

473
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:30,261
- What are you doing here?
- I live here. What are you doing here?

474
01:02:30,345 --> 01:02:32,824
- You live here?
- 1st floor to the left.

475
01:02:32,908 --> 01:02:37,550
- Do you know anything about that place?
- What do you want to know?

476
01:02:37,634 --> 01:02:40,913
What are they doing.
What does that Colonel do?

477
01:02:40,997 --> 01:02:46,759
Don't you want to come up. You look
like you're in need of a little peace.

478
01:02:46,843 --> 01:02:50,604
Well, can I borrow your phone?
I don't want to involve you in all this.

479
01:02:50,688 --> 01:02:53,772
Lots of people come here
all the time.

480
01:02:54,011 --> 01:02:59,526
- How about a bath?
- Thanks. Just the phone please.

481
01:03:15,234 --> 01:03:17,872
It doesn't matter. I didn't expect
anything.

482
01:03:17,956 --> 01:03:21,681
I just boiled some water for
some eggs.

483
01:03:22,401 --> 01:03:24,863
You know just in case, right?

484
01:03:25,404 --> 01:03:28,737
And I probably had one drink
too many.

485
01:03:29,408 --> 01:03:32,391
But I'll survive, I guess.

486
01:03:33,012 --> 01:03:37,253
Things just keep happening.
Maybe, if it's not too late.

487
01:03:37,337 --> 01:03:40,360
- That's fine by me. See you.
- Bye.

488
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:42,453
- Hello?
- yes.

489
01:03:42,862 --> 01:03:44,754
Where are you?

490
01:03:45,226 --> 01:03:49,560
If something is seriously wrong
you'd tell me, right?

491
01:03:49,990 --> 01:03:52,109
- Yes.
- You'd call me, right?

492
01:03:52,193 --> 01:03:55,027
- I'll call you. I promise.
- Okay.

493
01:03:55,116 --> 01:03:58,951
- See you... And thanks.
- No worries. Bye.

494
01:03:59,681 --> 01:04:03,515
Hello? The Thin man.
I almost forgot.

495
01:04:04,246 --> 01:04:07,830
He lives at Soevaenget 14.
It's in Gentofte.

496
01:04:08,130 --> 01:04:10,383
That's all.
Bye, bye.

497
01:04:13,336 --> 01:04:16,389
Yes, that's him.
I thought so.

498
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:19,271
Come and have a look.

499
01:04:23,506 --> 01:04:25,829
Come, look.

500
01:04:27,792 --> 01:04:30,532
He's Swedish. Quite pretty.

501
01:04:31,113 --> 01:04:33,993
The car's not bad either.

502
01:04:34,593 --> 01:04:37,790
He comes once in a while.
And then something's going on.

503
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:40,196
It never fails.

504
01:04:44,396 --> 01:04:47,813
- So what's going on?
- What do you think?

505
01:04:48,078 --> 01:04:50,716
It's every time you can't score.

506
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:55,436
They are dying, poor creatures.
They are feeling terrible.

507
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:59,079
Whenever there is a delivery
he's back again.

508
01:04:59,163 --> 01:05:01,239
- The Swedish guy.
- A courier?

509
01:05:01,323 --> 01:05:05,800
I don't know what's going on at
Topcat. Nothing unusual they say.

510
01:05:05,884 --> 01:05:09,961
Just the regular in out.
Perhaps a little slap in the behind.

511
01:05:10,045 --> 01:05:12,322
- Not my style.
- Is it the Colonel's?

512
01:05:12,406 --> 01:05:16,964
I think he represents the owners.
They own the whole building.

513
01:05:17,048 --> 01:05:21,046
- Soon they'll own the entire street.
- The Thin man?

514
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:24,927
I don't know anything about that.
Nothing at all.

515
01:05:25,011 --> 01:05:27,487
I only know the view from my window.

516
01:05:27,571 --> 01:05:32,405
And according to your view something
is going on at Topcat.

517
01:05:33,214 --> 01:05:36,214
I think it's the apartment upstairs.

518
01:05:39,377 --> 01:05:42,813
- Can you do me a favor?
- You want that bath after all?

519
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:44,617
Maybe later.

520
01:05:45,058 --> 01:05:49,335
I'm going to se what they're doing.
Would you mind calling the police?

521
01:05:49,419 --> 01:05:52,120
- No.
- No?

522
01:05:52,701 --> 01:05:56,633
You can make me do anything
but call the police?

523
01:05:57,383 --> 01:06:02,383
It's a principle. No matter what,
I'll never call the police.

524
01:06:03,265 --> 01:06:06,355
Listen. They are dying to get me.

525
01:06:08,187 --> 01:06:10,903
You don't have to tell your name.

526
01:06:10,987 --> 01:06:16,008
Just tell them, you watched me
enter Topcat.

527
01:06:17,069 --> 01:06:21,946
- Are you sure you're going in there?
- Positive.

528
01:06:22,030 --> 01:06:24,911
It's not fair.

529
01:06:25,512 --> 01:06:30,679
I wouldn't mind if the police
was here 5 minutes after I go in.

530
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:50,460
I see?

531
01:06:51,842 --> 01:06:55,562
Topcat, Absalonsgade.

532
01:06:58,404 --> 01:07:02,904
And you are certain about it?
What was your name again?

533
01:07:03,645 --> 01:07:05,856
Hello? Hello?

534
01:07:20,531 --> 01:07:24,713
Hello?
Oh, Kaj. Is it you?

535
01:07:25,493 --> 01:07:28,684
No, of course not. Who else?

536
01:07:29,335 --> 01:07:34,752
Could you please come over?
I could really use some moral support.

537
01:07:35,096 --> 01:07:37,448
Yes, as quickly as possible.

538
01:07:41,299 --> 01:07:44,096
I think you took a wrong turn.
It's down there.

539
01:07:44,180 --> 01:07:45,971
Thanks.

540
01:09:39,460 --> 01:09:41,856
- What the hell?
- Hands in the air.

541
01:09:41,940 --> 01:09:45,422
And backwards against the wall!
Come on!

542
01:09:46,103 --> 01:09:49,140
- What is all this?
- This is all right.

543
01:09:49,224 --> 01:09:51,981
Don't try anything or I'll pull
the trigger.

544
01:09:52,065 --> 01:09:55,461
- You murdered Ole chef, my friend.
- Never heard of the man.

545
01:09:55,545 --> 01:09:57,616
I won't hesitate.

546
01:09:58,107 --> 01:10:02,528
I will shoot. But if you keep calm
for a few minutes -

547
01:10:03,349 --> 01:10:05,516
- the police will be here.

548
01:10:08,589 --> 01:10:11,673
- Anonymous you say?
- Yes he hung up.

549
01:10:12,192 --> 01:10:14,507
A lot of people are
interested in him.

550
01:10:14,591 --> 01:10:17,363
Editor Otzen also keeps calling.

551
01:10:17,953 --> 01:10:22,344
It can't be him. The lab
determined -

552
01:10:23,155 --> 01:10:27,033
- that Ole chef was killed by
the same gun that killed Rosenbaum.

553
01:10:27,117 --> 01:10:31,473
When Rosenbaum was shot he was
sitting at a bar quite hammered.

554
01:10:31,557 --> 01:10:34,554
- I saw it myself.
- Ehlers wants him badly.

555
01:10:34,638 --> 01:10:36,916
Still, let's wait for Ehlers to come.

556
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,834
If he's at a nightclub
he's not going anywhere.

557
01:11:00,368 --> 01:11:05,179
- How long is this taking?
- Hands behind your neck!

558
01:11:24,217 --> 01:11:30,969
What do you do now?
Wait? Why aren't you doing anything?

559
01:11:39,821 --> 01:11:42,818
Will you let him get away with that?

560
01:11:42,902 --> 01:11:46,805
You do have someone who fixes
this, right?

561
01:11:50,625 --> 01:11:54,107
How do you run this
shit organization?

562
01:11:54,786 --> 01:11:58,036
So Danish...
So fucking, typical Danish!

563
01:11:58,349 --> 01:12:04,151
How weak.
You're just a pack of amateurs.

564
01:12:05,151 --> 01:12:06,871
Shut up!

565
01:12:07,312 --> 01:12:09,802
No, No, No. Forget it.

566
01:12:10,353 --> 01:12:12,913
I'm not keeping quiet.

567
01:12:14,873 --> 01:12:21,113
If the police arrives I have a lot to tell
them about you and your organization -

568
01:12:21,197 --> 01:12:23,056
- and your damn boss.

569
01:12:23,517 --> 01:12:27,767
- That's enough.
- Keep those hands up, and shut up!

570
01:12:28,878 --> 01:12:31,049
Do it yourself!

571
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:36,198
What sort of an antique gun is
that anyway?

572
01:12:36,282 --> 01:12:38,243
Is it even working?

573
01:13:22,657 --> 01:13:24,799
No, that's enough!

574
01:13:25,299 --> 01:13:29,510
Wake him up and wait for me.
We need him to talk.

575
01:13:47,616 --> 01:13:52,988
Hey... He's a real cowboy.
Did you see his revolver?

576
01:13:55,219 --> 01:13:57,779
hmm, the water is warm.

577
01:14:02,182 --> 01:14:04,712
Give him a cold shower.

578
01:15:26,131 --> 01:15:29,888
- Jesus. Is it you?
- Didn't you call the police?

579
01:15:29,972 --> 01:15:32,648
- I called. I promise.
- Call again.

580
01:15:32,732 --> 01:15:34,970
Close the door and call them
again.

581
01:15:35,054 --> 01:15:38,804
You look awful. you're bleeding.
Are you hurt?

582
01:15:39,256 --> 01:15:43,412
Everything is fine. Just please
call the police now.

583
01:15:43,496 --> 01:15:49,135
- Well, I don't know... - What the hell
is it with you and the police?

584
01:15:49,219 --> 01:15:52,129
- I'm off.
- No, Kaj. Please don't.

585
01:15:52,739 --> 01:15:54,561
I'm gone.

586
01:15:59,782 --> 01:16:01,603
Make that call.

587
01:16:17,628 --> 01:16:24,590
Yes, hello? I just called you.
Why didn't you come?

588
01:16:27,712 --> 01:16:31,824
- Hello. Let me talk to Ehlers.
- Who is this?

589
01:16:34,674 --> 01:16:38,645
- Chief Ehlers is not here right now.
- Come on.

590
01:16:41,877 --> 01:16:45,044
Where is he? Who's at the
station then?

591
01:16:53,041 --> 01:16:56,231
Nobody? That's impossible!

592
01:17:51,302 --> 01:17:54,742
Take it easy! It's me. It's just me.

593
01:17:55,422 --> 01:17:57,384
Otzen? Jesus?

594
01:18:00,464 --> 01:18:04,675
Oh, God... The police?

595
01:18:06,267 --> 01:18:09,101
- Come on, damn it.
- Yes, yes. Hi.

596
01:18:09,467 --> 01:18:13,624
Get to work. Barbara called. She
was afraid something had happened.

597
01:18:13,708 --> 01:18:17,827
Are you hurt? You're bleeding.
We have to get you to a hospital.

598
01:18:17,911 --> 01:18:19,988
As I told you. Nothing had
happened.

599
01:18:20,072 --> 01:18:22,628
- Can I take him to the hospital?
- Of course.

600
01:18:22,712 --> 01:18:28,015
- We're going there immediately.
- I'll take that.

601
01:18:41,965 --> 01:18:46,428
Go home and sleep. We can discuss
this later.

602
01:18:52,690 --> 01:18:55,190
Half of them are still in bed.

603
01:18:55,293 --> 01:18:59,811
Barbara is cleaning your apartment.
She told me she has a key.

604
01:18:59,895 --> 01:19:03,128
- She was saying hi.
- Fine, thanks.

605
01:19:05,899 --> 01:19:09,138
- Just a moment, please.
- He needs to go home and sleep.

606
01:19:09,222 --> 01:19:14,061
I have to take him back to the station
first. We need some more information.

607
01:19:14,145 --> 01:19:18,479
- Is that really necessary?
- It's okay. Don't worry.

608
01:19:21,508 --> 01:19:25,508
- Then you take him home later.
- I'll see to it.

609
01:19:32,236 --> 01:19:36,518
Otzen? I want you to back
to Bent.

610
01:19:37,319 --> 01:19:40,069
- And pay for the damages.
- What?

611
01:19:40,201 --> 01:19:43,368
You heard me. You got some great
shots.

612
01:19:43,762 --> 01:19:47,094
- That's worth a lot, right?
- True.

613
01:19:47,765 --> 01:19:51,643
- Can I count on you?
- Of course. I'll take care of it.

614
01:19:51,727 --> 01:19:54,609
- I'll be seeing you.
- Yes, bye.

615
01:19:57,771 --> 01:20:00,809
There are no doubt about it.
Those two we got...

616
01:20:00,893 --> 01:20:03,491
They killed Ole chef and Rosenbaum.

617
01:20:03,575 --> 01:20:05,856
The gun matches.

618
01:20:07,937 --> 01:20:11,351
I had them. I was sitting with them.

619
01:20:12,021 --> 01:20:15,532
Both the Colonel and a Swedish
guy.

620
01:20:16,224 --> 01:20:19,861
And a whole suitcase full of
drugs. I had them.

621
01:20:19,945 --> 01:20:24,025
- If only you showed up.
- I wish you'd stay out of police business!

622
01:20:24,109 --> 01:20:26,026
It completely hopeless!

623
01:20:26,270 --> 01:20:30,548
It's impossible to do our jobs
when you constantly mess around.

624
01:20:30,632 --> 01:20:32,953
I'm sorry.

625
01:20:35,715 --> 01:20:41,795
All the drugs were gone when we
arrived. Even the dogs didn't find anything.

626
01:20:41,879 --> 01:20:45,129
Radio news, this is Thursday
March 14th.

627
01:20:45,761 --> 01:20:50,640
A girl was discovered dead in a
train between Fredericia and Vejle.

628
01:20:50,724 --> 01:20:53,842
The girl was a junkie and was
found in the toilet -

629
01:20:53,926 --> 01:20:58,086
- after injection of an instantly
lethal dose of heroin.

630
01:20:58,170 --> 01:21:01,420
The police withholds the girls
identity.

631
01:21:01,571 --> 01:21:03,293
Hanne.

632
01:21:10,498 --> 01:21:14,399
Yes, that's right.
Hanne Margrethe Jespersen.

633
01:21:19,902 --> 01:21:23,182
I'm sorry.
You knew her well, didn't you?

634
01:21:23,266 --> 01:21:27,850
She was dating Ole.
It was me who put her on that train.

635
01:21:28,035 --> 01:21:30,505
- She wanted to go home.
- She carried any drugs?

636
01:21:30,589 --> 01:21:34,548
Quite the opposite in fact.
She was not feeling well.

637
01:21:34,632 --> 01:21:40,216
- I shouldn't have left her.
- Someone gave it to her on that train.

638
01:21:43,038 --> 01:21:46,788
Just a couple of things.
It doesn't take long.

639
01:21:47,201 --> 01:21:52,240
- The director of the police is on the wire.
- Oh, so he's up early too.

640
01:21:52,324 --> 01:21:54,644
Just a moment.

641
01:22:28,745 --> 01:22:34,829
I didn't quite get that.
Would you mind repeating that?

642
01:22:35,870 --> 01:22:40,684
Well, let's get this thing over
with...

643
01:24:25,119 --> 01:24:27,119
- Oh, is it you?
- Bille?

644
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:30,612
I am so happy to see you.

645
01:24:31,242 --> 01:24:34,435
- What happened?
- happened?

646
01:24:35,926 --> 01:24:38,838
Quite simple in fact.
I shot him.

647
01:24:39,447 --> 01:24:42,999
- You shot him?
- The Thin man, yes.

648
01:24:43,691 --> 01:24:46,191
One shot. That was sufficient.

649
01:24:48,774 --> 01:24:52,495
He lies in there. On a Persian rug.

650
01:24:59,781 --> 01:25:02,523
- Jesus!
- Yes.

651
01:25:03,103 --> 01:25:08,103
I am very happy to see you.
Would you mind following me home?

652
01:25:08,425 --> 01:25:10,287
Not at all.

653
01:25:11,347 --> 01:25:14,120
You better close the door.

654
01:25:20,834 --> 01:25:23,872
The train is far. Do you want me
to call a taxi?

655
01:25:23,956 --> 01:25:27,008
No. It's not necessary. I can
walk.

656
01:25:29,518 --> 01:25:35,072
I can walk now. Hardly any pains
in my leg.

657
01:25:36,044 --> 01:25:40,256
- That's nice.
- Isn't it odd?

658
01:25:44,368 --> 01:25:48,942
It's a strange feeling killing
someone.

659
01:25:49,772 --> 01:25:52,653
Taking a life.

660
01:25:54,294 --> 01:25:58,057
It cleanses your body and soul.

661
01:26:01,378 --> 01:26:04,862
Is that spring I feel in the air?

662
01:26:23,592 --> 01:26:27,259
- Would you do me another favor?
- Of course.

663
01:26:28,555 --> 01:26:31,553
Would you please deliver this
to the police?

664
01:26:31,637 --> 01:26:34,355
- It's a confession.
- A confession?

665
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:38,092
- In all details.
- That's not necessary.

666
01:26:38,803 --> 01:26:41,961
- Nobody will suspect you.
- Yes. That is necessary.

667
01:26:42,045 --> 01:26:44,506
They must know it was me.

668
01:26:45,047 --> 01:26:49,164
That one of the old ones from
the neighborhood did it.

669
01:26:49,248 --> 01:26:53,501
- Maybe this place can be better.
- Well...

670
01:26:54,291 --> 01:26:56,924
All your books?

671
01:26:57,493 --> 01:27:03,077
The pains in my right leg once again
remind me that I'm an old man.

672
01:27:04,059 --> 01:27:07,176
Soon I won't be able to mount
the ladder.

673
01:27:07,260 --> 01:27:09,932
Now, let's drink our port.

674
01:27:16,026 --> 01:27:19,664
Listen. I won't say a word.
Are you absolutely certain...

675
01:27:19,748 --> 01:27:22,730
Let's have another port.

676
01:27:30,875 --> 01:27:34,356
- And you will do me that favor?
- Okay.

677
01:27:35,038 --> 01:27:40,276
First I was going to mail it. I am happy
the police will receive it sooner.

678
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:45,073
Officially I can't support this.

679
01:27:45,925 --> 01:27:50,276
But between us I respect the
old man.

680
01:27:51,088 --> 01:27:57,172
Which reminds me... Where were
you going with that revolver?

681
01:28:05,017 --> 01:28:09,659
This is Bille's. He had a pair.
He has the other one.

682
01:28:12,261 --> 01:28:14,192
And it is loaded?

683
01:28:16,984 --> 01:28:21,462
I better get you home and in bed
before you escape again.

684
01:28:21,546 --> 01:28:24,796
- By the way. Did you report it?
- What?

685
01:28:33,835 --> 01:28:36,919
'When you receive this I will
be dead'

686
01:28:37,316 --> 01:28:40,955
'I am taking my own life and
nobody must be sad.'

687
01:28:41,039 --> 01:28:44,161
'I did my duty and lived long
enough.'

688
01:28:44,801 --> 01:28:48,353
'Respectfully, Bille'

689
01:30:08,693 --> 01:30:11,296
It's no use putting you to bed.

690
01:30:11,856 --> 01:30:17,523
But we could go for a walk.
The weather is fine. I'll buy you a beer.

691
01:30:57,644 --> 01:31:02,144
- How do you feel?
- Might as well go on that vacation.

692
01:31:08,570 --> 01:31:10,503
- Hey.
- Ahmed!

693
01:31:10,973 --> 01:31:16,636
- I drove you around.
- How much do I owe you?

694
01:31:17,616 --> 01:31:21,015
You owe me 300. Only kidding.
You need to listen to that tape.

695
01:31:21,099 --> 01:31:23,183
You have to listen. Come.

696
01:31:29,704 --> 01:31:31,822
- Where's the Colonel?
- Sick.

697
01:31:31,906 --> 01:31:35,024
Let's do it then. We don't have
all night.

698
01:31:35,108 --> 01:31:38,545
Come on then.
And the curiosity is unhealthy for you.

699
01:31:38,629 --> 01:31:42,708
That is the Thin man.
There are no doubts about it.

700
01:31:42,792 --> 01:31:45,959
He was there in person.
I'll be damned.

701
01:31:46,115 --> 01:31:49,836
So that's why Ole was crazy
about that tape.

702
01:31:50,557 --> 01:31:54,076
- Would you have been able to arrest him?
- Maybe.

703
01:31:54,160 --> 01:31:59,713
It always depends on the judge.
He had some demonic lawyers.

704
01:32:00,683 --> 01:32:04,802
If I just hadn't been that drunk
and preoccupied with myself that night...

705
01:32:04,886 --> 01:32:08,524
- If I hadn't fallen asleep...
- I said maybe.

706
01:32:08,608 --> 01:32:14,525
There are no guaranties with us.
But an old book shop keeper. He did it.

707
01:32:14,732 --> 01:32:19,085
- Do you need a ride?
- No I want to walk.

708
01:32:26,020 --> 01:32:30,371
Somebody should write down that story.
