1
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,119
.

2
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,041
Alfred, are you also going to
the auction in Backhorva?

3
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:32,429
Yes. We'll be on our way soon.

4
00:00:36,029 --> 00:00:39,307
<i>This day there was
an auction in Backhorva,</i>

5
00:00:39,332 --> 00:00:41,412
<i>and everyone wanted to go.</i>

6
00:00:41,437 --> 00:00:45,036
<i>Auctions were popular in
Lönneberga and in Smaland.</i>

7
00:00:45,622 --> 00:00:48,695
<i>The Katthulters also
wanted to participate.</i>

8
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,480
Let Emil go too.

9
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,781
Let him out, Ida. He has
been in the shed long enough.

10
00:00:54,874 --> 00:00:57,914
I don't know what Emil
should do at an auction.

11
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,549
Also, if we don't take him,
there'll be enough excitement.

12
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:06,548
When Emil wants to come
to the auction, he will come.

13
00:01:06,573 --> 00:01:08,407
Just let him come, then.

14
00:01:08,432 --> 00:01:13,335
Take better care of your behavior
and don't fool around as usual.

15
00:01:15,544 --> 00:01:18,424
Emil! You can come out.

16
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,250
Father? Will you buy me
something at the auction?

17
00:01:30,321 --> 00:01:33,175
Buy and purchase.
I never hear anything else.

18
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,660
Didn't I buy you
candy for ten øre?

19
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,900
For your birthday in January.
Already forgotten?

20
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,820
Emil, are you coming with me?

21
00:01:41,845 --> 00:01:44,805
Drive ahead.
I'm following on Lukas.

22
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,780
What is he up to?

23
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,140
You probably best stay at home.

24
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,860
And come home safely.

25
00:01:55,604 --> 00:01:57,644
Goodbye!

26
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:06,264
I hope that Alfred has a thick skull
that holds when they fight.

27
00:02:06,445 --> 00:02:10,525
If you don't, you
shouldn't go to an auction.

28
00:02:14,327 --> 00:02:16,395
<i>Emil needed money.</i>

29
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,630
<i>You can't go to an
auction without money.</i>

30
00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:22,833
<i>Asking dad was pointless.</i>

31
00:02:23,225 --> 00:02:28,256
<i>So he had to get money.
But how?</i>

32
00:02:29,855 --> 00:02:33,829
<i>If you had been a child
in Smaland at that time,</i>

33
00:02:33,992 --> 00:02:39,446
<i>you would have known how blessed
many gates there were on all roads.</i>

34
00:02:39,749 --> 00:02:42,147
<i>This was a good thing for the children,</i>

35
00:02:42,172 --> 00:02:45,366
<i>because they earned money
by opening the gates.</i>

36
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:15,471
Well Emil? Are you
now also a gate boy?

37
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:16,976
Uh-huh.

38
00:03:21,863 --> 00:03:23,743
Thank you.

39
00:03:36,765 --> 00:03:40,245
You will get rich, Emil.
Here you go.

40
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:57,940
Do you have time for this?
So who's pulling the pranks?

41
00:03:57,965 --> 00:03:59,805
Right now, no one.

42
00:04:05,893 --> 00:04:08,133
Hey! Why are you closing the gate?

43
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:11,082
How can I open it if I
don't close it first.

44
00:04:11,107 --> 00:04:13,027
Oh, open it!

45
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,152
Why don't you leave
it open on a day like this?

46
00:04:18,128 --> 00:04:20,088
I would be crazy.

47
00:04:20,113 --> 00:04:23,448
When I can make such pocket
money for the auction.

48
00:04:23,618 --> 00:04:27,538
Then you should get
gate money from me too.

49
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,754
- Is that my pedestal?
- Yes...

50
00:04:36,934 --> 00:04:40,179
At an auction the auctioneer
sets the minimum price.

51
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:44,220
If somebody wants an item,
he must offer more.

52
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:49,045
Whoever offers the
most, gets the object.

53
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:54,611
Now we'll begin the auction.

54
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:59,220
First we auction
hammer and pliers.

55
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,340
Who offers 25 øre for both?

56
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,460
- Ten øre.
- That's too little.

57
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,389
- 15 øre.
- Not enough either. 20.

58
00:05:06,414 --> 00:05:08,614
25. Who offers more than 25?

59
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,980
- 32!
- 35.

60
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,100
35. A bid of 40.

61
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,620
40 øre. Going once,
going twice, sold!

62
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,464
Hammer and tongs go
to you for 40 øre.

63
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,500
If Emil from Katthult-Farm is
coming, we better go home.

64
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,020
(Auctioneer)... a pendulum clock.

65
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:38,980
A wall clock, which has been the
pride and joy of a wealthy household.

66
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,180
Who bids?
23 are bid and awarded.

67
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,020
The pendulum clock goes
to Kalle for 23 kroner.

68
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,900
Then we have a very
comfortable sofa.

69
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,740
What's your bid?

70
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,940
- 3.50.
- 3.50.

71
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,324
- Four!
- Four are offered here.

72
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:56,023
4.50.

73
00:05:56,048 --> 00:05:57,620
Does anyone offer more?

74
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,460
- Five.
- Five.

75
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,500
5.50. Because I want that sofa.

76
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,111
Yes, yes. 5.50.
A tenacious bidder.

77
00:06:04,136 --> 00:06:06,136
And you? Even more?

78
00:06:07,152 --> 00:06:10,592
No? Then the lot goes
to the old lady for 5.50.

79
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:14,980
Well, I am lucky. What would I
have done with that old sofa?

80
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,380
What do we have here?
A bread shovel.

81
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,300
Who bids?

82
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,620
Nobody? Nobody bids anything?
Does nobody bake at home anymore?

83
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,300
For the bread shovel I
only want twenty-five øre.

84
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,940
My bid.

85
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,620
For 25 øre to Emil
from Katthult farm...

86
00:06:34,746 --> 00:06:37,480
goes this beautiful bread shovel.

87
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,300
And now...

88
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,980
Emil, are you going
to start baking bread?

89
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,860
A bread shovel is always good to have.

90
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,479
What do you need the box for?

91
00:06:51,634 --> 00:06:56,547
I want to give it to Ida.
It's nice. This is velvet.

92
00:06:56,572 --> 00:06:59,390
Oh, well. That old thing
has never been nice.

93
00:07:00,033 --> 00:07:03,515
What do I have here?
A fire engine.

94
00:07:04,282 --> 00:07:06,497
Who is bidding a crown?

95
00:07:06,532 --> 00:07:08,635
Then 50 øre.

96
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,780
What if a fire breaks
out in your house?

97
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,540
Twenty-five then. Who bids?

98
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,020
I bid 25 øre.

99
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,140
25 øre!

100
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,220
Going once, going twice, sold!

101
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,100
Uh-oh. I didn't
want to have that.

102
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,789
Always in for a joke, Emil.
Now you can extinguish fires.

103
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:32,339
Alfred! Alfred!

104
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,439
- Where's the farmer?
- Up at the barn.

105
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,580
25 øre. In cash.

106
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,300
Well, then we have a pair of skis.

107
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,460
- Who bids?
- Ten øre.

108
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,660
Ten øre are bid.

109
00:07:48,785 --> 00:07:51,025
Farmer!

110
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,060
Yes, what is it?

111
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,940
- Farmer!
- Yes?

112
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,820
Emil is buying a fire engine.
Can he do that?

113
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,820
What? A fire engine?

114
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,300
He must have lost his mind.

115
00:08:03,325 --> 00:08:05,405
Yes, he probably did.

116
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,820
Say, fire engine owner Emil Svensson.

117
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,540
What do you want to
do with that thing?

118
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:22,220
When lightning strikes
and starts a fire...

119
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,940
Just wait! I will help you.

120
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,567
You darn rascal!

121
00:08:26,638 --> 00:08:29,481
What do you want to
do with this fire engine?

122
00:08:29,506 --> 00:08:31,599
And who's paying for it?

123
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:34,911
I paid for it from my own money.

124
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,220
Oh?

125
00:08:37,902 --> 00:08:41,167
Darn rascal! Now tell me
where you got the money!

126
00:08:41,282 --> 00:08:44,002
I have earned it
as a gate boy.

127
00:08:44,408 --> 00:08:46,488
Well, really.

128
00:08:48,721 --> 00:08:50,841
Well, where's the money?

129
00:08:52,897 --> 00:08:57,900
All right. I don't want involvement
with such transactions.

130
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,260
Did you buy anything else?

131
00:09:00,675 --> 00:09:03,260
Naughty boy! A bread shovel!

132
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,820
You know that we have
a bread shovel at home.

133
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,580
What's this? A shell box.

134
00:09:09,937 --> 00:09:12,940
The hideous thing is
totally worthless.

135
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,988
How often did I tell
you to only buy things,

136
00:09:17,043 --> 00:09:20,220
which are really
necessary, dear Emil.

137
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,940
What a naughty
little boy you are.

138
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,260
5.20. 5.20!

139
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,580
5.30 is bid.

140
00:09:29,771 --> 00:09:32,371
- 5.35 in the back.
- One beer.

141
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,878
5.35. 5.40.

142
00:09:34,925 --> 00:09:40,100
- 5.45. Who's bidding more than 5.45?
- I'd like to have one more.

143
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:44,340
This is almost for free.
Who's bidding more?

144
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,300
This is a unique opportunity.

145
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:52,685
- And another bottle.
- Who's bidding more than 5.45?

146
00:09:59,873 --> 00:10:03,725
Just wait! Do you want to
put the money in lemonade,

147
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,790
after earning a few crowns?

148
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:10,705
If I don't have money,
I can't buy lemonade,

149
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,900
and if I have some,
then I can't buy any.

150
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,740
I want to know when
I can buy lemonade.

151
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:20,459
Naughty boy.

152
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:24,980
It will be the shed for you
when we get home.

153
00:10:30,538 --> 00:10:33,249
You'll be locked in the shed, Emil.

154
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,420
Please another lemonade.

155
00:10:40,296 --> 00:10:42,060
The lemonade is excellent.

156
00:10:42,092 --> 00:10:44,892
I've never drunk
anything like that.

157
00:10:48,067 --> 00:10:50,140
An auction is the most
beautiful thing there is.

158
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,180
At least as beautiful as
the market in Vimmerby.

159
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:57,820
And the most beautiful thing is that
you get away from work for a while.

160
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,814
It's nice to have enough work.

161
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:04,653
Yes, but the work never
ends for a farm hand.

162
00:11:05,311 --> 00:11:07,231
It never stops.

163
00:11:09,309 --> 00:11:12,749
- But I'll help you, Alfred.
- Yes, you do.

164
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,980
How good to have you, Emil.

165
00:11:19,775 --> 00:11:21,475
Oh, the wine.

166
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,460
Come sit down.

167
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,700
I'll help you up here.

168
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,100
Now look at Lina
and Krakstorparn!

169
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:43,780
Let's marry our stupid Lina
with this Krakstorparn.

170
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,260
Then you are rid of
her for all time.

171
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,740
Oh, that would be a good thing.

172
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:54,340
<i>Actually Lina wanted to
get engaged with Alfred,</i>

173
00:11:54,865 --> 00:11:56,660
<i>but Alfred didn't want to marry.</i>

174
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,740
<i>Now Alfred and Emil
were thinking,</i>

175
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,148
<i>that Lina should marry Krakstorparn.</i>

176
00:12:03,173 --> 00:12:08,180
<i>Perhaps he was too old for Lina,
but he had a little farm,</i>

177
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,580
<i>and Lina would surely
like to be a farmer's wife.</i>

178
00:12:11,816 --> 00:12:14,620
We should make sure that
no one disturbs them.

179
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,500
Will I get 20 crowns
for this fat sow?

180
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,137
- 20!
- 20?

181
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,520
20 crowns are bid.
Who's bidding more?

182
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,540
- 21!
- 21. Who's bidding more?

183
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,700
- 22.
- 22 over there.

184
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,020
- Who's bidding?
- 23.

185
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:35,072
23. Who bids more than 23 crowns?
Going once...

186
00:12:35,103 --> 00:12:37,910
I'm bidding 25 crowns
and no one crown more.

187
00:12:37,935 --> 00:12:39,972
A bid of 25.

188
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,820
25 going once,

189
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,207
25 going second,

190
00:12:44,232 --> 00:12:46,027
and sold.

191
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,400
You'll feel good
at Katthult farm.

192
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:53,775
Because Emil lives there.
You've certainly heard of him before.

193
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,120
Do you hear how happy she is?

194
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:17,722
Bulten I Bo was the worst drunkard
and the biggest ruffian in Lönneberga.

195
00:13:17,795 --> 00:13:22,733
That there were fights at the
auctions were mostly Bulten's fault.

196
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:26,395
If he had drunk a few schnapps,

197
00:13:26,457 --> 00:13:30,217
he didn't know what to
do with the wildness,

198
00:13:30,251 --> 00:13:32,622
which bubbled out of him.

199
00:13:32,647 --> 00:13:36,264
Yes, unfortunately not
everyone drank lemonade,

200
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:39,250
and especially Bulten I Bo didn't.

201
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:48,482
Aren't you ashamed, Lina! What
do you want with that old rabbit?

202
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:50,779
He's too old for you.

203
00:13:51,653 --> 00:13:53,794
Wait. Say that again if you dare!

204
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:58,286
No! Stay put!
I can manage Bulten on my own.

205
00:13:59,387 --> 00:14:02,801
Leave people alone if they're
having a nice time together.

206
00:14:02,826 --> 00:14:04,706
You lout!

207
00:14:05,084 --> 00:14:11,373
Let the boy be, otherwise you'll carry
your arms and legs home in a bundle!

208
00:14:11,662 --> 00:14:13,982
Just try if you're suicidal!

209
00:14:14,131 --> 00:14:18,851
Come on! I'll hit you green and blue.

210
00:14:19,336 --> 00:14:21,576
I'll show you.

211
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,420
You bloody dung-heap!

212
00:14:28,828 --> 00:14:31,672
I'll get you for this! Ouch!

213
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,940
You bastard!
I'll break all your bones.

214
00:14:35,285 --> 00:14:37,933
Everyone had been waiting for this.

215
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:42,239
They came from everywhere
wanting to join the fight.

216
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,164
Do I have a say?

217
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:53,517
Get lost! This is
not your brawl!

218
00:14:55,056 --> 00:14:57,440
Oh! They are all fighting over me.

219
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,580
That would suit you, Lina.

220
00:15:13,598 --> 00:15:15,758
Now come here, you!

221
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:21,845
Where are you, Alfred? Where are you?

222
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:26,471
- Are you down there?
- Yes, Emil. I'm right at the bottom.

223
00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:34,159
Break up! We want to
do some more bidding.

224
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,280
Yes, save some blood for later.

225
00:15:42,076 --> 00:15:43,319
Stop!

226
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,740
Stop it!

227
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,380
Does it hurt bad, Alfred?

228
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,660
Oh no, it doesn't.

229
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,780
Though someone
almost tore off my nose.

230
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,860
My dear friend, I
really got him good.

231
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,220
Even when my pants are torn,

232
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,100
and my nose got quite a hit.

233
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,220
My ear is damaged as well.

234
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,947
There's an auction in
Knasholt next week.

235
00:16:33,002 --> 00:16:34,762
There we can carry on.

236
00:16:35,264 --> 00:16:38,900
No way. No fighting at my auction.

237
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:42,034
Oh, I wouldn't
give a guarantee.

238
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:43,899
I think so too.

239
00:16:44,651 --> 00:16:48,740
You may need a fire
engine for your auction.

240
00:16:48,789 --> 00:16:50,589
It's for sale.

241
00:16:52,403 --> 00:16:55,254
I bought the fire engine for 25 øre...

242
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,390
and I sold it for 50.

243
00:16:57,415 --> 00:16:59,743
So I made 25 profit.

244
00:17:00,174 --> 00:17:02,014
You're not stupid.

245
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:05,519
You'll certainly become
a good business man.

246
00:17:05,653 --> 00:17:08,224
There's a bid of 74 crowns.

247
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:12,660
Who's bidding more for a cow in
her best years? 74 crowns.

248
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,420
Who's bidding more?

249
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:16,759
Now check your pockets!

250
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,340
A bid for 75.
Who's bidding more?

251
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,260
76.

252
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:26,140
76 from there.

253
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,420
You bought six cows yesterday.

254
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:34,060
I want this last cow.
76 crowns and 50 øre.

255
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,466
76.50 is bid.

256
00:17:36,497 --> 00:17:39,137
- 77.
- 77 crowns is bid.

257
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,460
Do you bid more?

258
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,860
77, going once,

259
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:47,180
going twice, and...

260
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:51,500
- 80 crowns and no more.
- 80 crowns. Anyone bids more?

261
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,820
You have her.

262
00:17:54,298 --> 00:17:56,940
Going once, going twice and sold.

263
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,700
The cow goes to
Svensson for 80 crowns.

264
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:03,500
And now I have a whole
bunch of chickens to offer.

265
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:07,700
15 laying hens. What do you pay
for this unique opportunity?

266
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:10,347
- I bid ten.
- Ten crowns being bid.

267
00:18:10,372 --> 00:18:13,892
Ten crowns.
Ten crowns. Ten crowns.

268
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,340
For ten crowns to Bastefallarn.

269
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:22,220
I don't want the limping hen.
You can slaughter it.

270
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:26,284
He's stupid. Limping Lotte
is our best laying hen.

271
00:18:26,389 --> 00:18:29,189
I bid 25 øre for limping Lotte.

272
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,660
Come! Come!

273
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,620
Stop! Where are you going?

274
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,500
Stop! Wait!

275
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,220
Will you stand still!

276
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,300
Come on!

277
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,410
The beast is crazy.
Give me a gun.

278
00:19:48,435 --> 00:19:50,434
I'll shoot her.

279
00:19:52,715 --> 00:19:55,875
<i>Emil's father
was sorry for the cow.</i>

280
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,533
<i>But there's no use
for a crazy cow.</i>

281
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:00,838
<i>Everybody understood.</i>

282
00:20:04,145 --> 00:20:07,597
- Here you have a rifle.
- Is it loaded?

283
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,580
Of course it is.

284
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,140
- So...
- But Anton...

285
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:15,380
Do you really want
to shoot the cow?

286
00:20:15,835 --> 00:20:18,100
Stop, father!

287
00:20:18,235 --> 00:20:22,594
If you're going to shoot the poor
cow, you'd better give it to me.

288
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:24,459
What do you want the cow for?

289
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:29,060
You've done enough
crazy business today.

290
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:32,718
Can't you give
the poor cow to me?

291
00:20:32,743 --> 00:20:35,983
You should really
give her to Emil.

292
00:20:36,678 --> 00:20:40,380
Well, if you can get her
home, you can have her.

293
00:20:40,709 --> 00:20:43,240
But this monster will
knock over everything

294
00:20:43,312 --> 00:20:45,552
or demolish the barn.

295
00:20:51,227 --> 00:20:54,340
Mr. Bastefallarn, if I drive
your cows to Katthult,

296
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,700
what would you pay for it?

297
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,700
Well, to me it would
be worth 25 øre.

298
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,780
It's a deal!

299
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,440
<i>Now guess what Emil did.</i>

300
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:09,820
<i>He tied the six cows that
Bastefallarn had bought,</i>

301
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,980
<i>and drove them to the crazy
cow he had called Rolla.</i>

302
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,442
<i>Rolla became calm and docile
in company with the other cows.</i>

303
00:21:15,467 --> 00:21:18,347
<i>For Emil had been the
only one to understand,</i>

304
00:21:18,372 --> 00:21:20,252
<i>that Rolla was that stubborn...</i>

305
00:21:20,277 --> 00:21:23,677
<i>because she couldn't be
together with other cows.</i>

306
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:30,900
Help me, Alfred.
I'll just get Lukas.

307
00:21:33,977 --> 00:21:39,084
<i>Now I'll be the laughing stock
of Lönneberga for ever and ever.</i>

308
00:21:50,429 --> 00:21:52,349
Go, cows. Go!

309
00:21:52,569 --> 00:21:55,049
We want to go home to Katthult.

310
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,420
Life stock owner Emil Svensson,

311
00:21:58,555 --> 00:22:00,275
now you have a horse,

312
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,917
a limping chicken
and a crazy cow.

313
00:22:02,942 --> 00:22:04,542
Anything else that you want?

314
00:22:04,567 --> 00:22:07,527
In time I'll get a lot more.

315
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,760
- Mother?
- Yes?

316
00:22:16,785 --> 00:22:19,665
- Now they're coming!
- Ah! Do they?

317
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:25,127
No... God have mercy...

318
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,700
What is this?

319
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:32,295
Now the father of Katthult
might be in over his head.

320
00:22:32,356 --> 00:22:37,014
- Seven cows! He has gone mad.
- Yes.

321
00:22:37,822 --> 00:22:40,186
Hello! Where do you want to go?

322
00:22:40,211 --> 00:22:42,371
Seven cows! That's crazy.

323
00:22:42,896 --> 00:22:45,176
Yes.

324
00:23:05,158 --> 00:23:09,038
Seven cows! Is it you or
me gone mad, Anton?

325
00:23:09,127 --> 00:23:12,927
The cows are.
No, they are not my cows.

326
00:23:12,968 --> 00:23:14,636
They're Bastefallarn's.

327
00:23:14,661 --> 00:23:18,504
The cow I bought
is no longer mine.

328
00:23:18,683 --> 00:23:21,780
And I don't want her back.

329
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,020
Yes, but Anton,

330
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:27,260
what are Bastefallarns
cows doing here with us?

331
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,460
Hm!

332
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:32,344
<i>It took some explanations,</i>

333
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,794
<i>before Emil's mother understood,</i>

334
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:37,568
<i>what the matter was
with the cows.</i>

335
00:23:37,933 --> 00:23:40,253
God bless you, Emil.

336
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,293
What a clever boy you are.

337
00:23:43,318 --> 00:23:47,138
- Without you, our cow would still be there.
- It's my cow now.

338
00:23:47,163 --> 00:23:49,803
- Yes.
- And don't you forget.

339
00:23:53,434 --> 00:23:57,590
- This is for you, Ida.
- That's sweet, Emil.

340
00:23:57,642 --> 00:23:59,202
Yes.

341
00:24:00,608 --> 00:24:04,208
- Wait! I take her.
- She's already laid an egg.

342
00:24:07,317 --> 00:24:10,557
Now this is a very good
laying hen, Emil.

343
00:24:11,543 --> 00:24:16,143
But Alfred, what in the world
did happen to your nose?

344
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,853
In Backhorva at the auction.

345
00:24:19,193 --> 00:24:23,033
And next week, this will
be repeated in Knasholt.

346
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:29,099
What's with you, Lina?
What's that face for?

347
00:24:29,281 --> 00:24:33,007
- Toothache.
- Our poor Lina.

348
00:24:33,202 --> 00:24:36,562
Krakstorparn has probably
given you too many candies?

349
00:24:49,802 --> 00:24:53,322
What is it, Emil?
Do you want to milk now?

350
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:59,100
I can't help that Bastefallarn
isn't yet here to milk his cows.

351
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,961
Here you go.

352
00:25:14,986 --> 00:25:17,346
This one is from limping Lotte.

353
00:25:18,374 --> 00:25:20,814
And this is from Rolla.

354
00:25:23,526 --> 00:25:26,166
This is a nice bread shovel.

355
00:25:26,347 --> 00:25:30,387
How could you know that
my old one was broken?

356
00:25:30,412 --> 00:25:35,012
- Yes, it is.
- The old one is for firewood.

357
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:38,241
Anton, it was very
clever from Emil,

358
00:25:38,266 --> 00:25:41,386
to buy a bread shovel for me.

359
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:49,618
<i>Lina held a hot potato
against the tooth.</i>

360
00:25:49,643 --> 00:25:53,595
<i>And then it hurt seven times more.</i>

361
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:57,060
Darn. Now it really hurts.

362
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:02,020
It was careless of Krakstorparn
to offer you sweets.

363
00:26:03,303 --> 00:26:07,646
- You should marry him, Lina.
- Ouch! That old man?

364
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,168
He's already 50 and I'm only 25.

365
00:26:10,231 --> 00:26:13,082
I don't marry someone
twice as old.

366
00:26:13,107 --> 00:26:16,347
That doesn't matter.
He can still be nice.

367
00:26:16,456 --> 00:26:19,576
Oh, now it wouldn't be so bad,

368
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:23,820
but... when I'm 50...

369
00:26:24,087 --> 00:26:26,247
he's already 100.

370
00:26:27,792 --> 00:26:31,206
Lord, what trouble would that bring?

371
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:35,620
You're counting as
if you have no brain.

372
00:26:35,892 --> 00:26:37,932
Crazy business.

373
00:26:38,879 --> 00:26:41,559
Old fart.

374
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:46,020
Emil! I can't open the box.

375
00:26:55,174 --> 00:26:56,934
Now that's good.

376
00:26:56,959 --> 00:27:02,039
When I have to write letters,
I already have some in stock.

377
00:27:03,146 --> 00:27:06,178
Ida loved the
box with the shells.

378
00:27:06,203 --> 00:27:10,406
She put her hymnbook,
her thimble,

379
00:27:10,783 --> 00:27:15,407
her scissors, beautiful
colorful glitter...

380
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:19,620
and her red hair loop inside.

381
00:27:23,707 --> 00:27:26,747
Well, father?
What about the shed?

382
00:27:27,452 --> 00:27:31,366
You don't deserve to
be imprisoned today.

383
00:27:31,475 --> 00:27:34,795
If I really think it over,
you have only done good.

384
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:38,980
That's true, of course,
but what's said is said.

385
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,821
- Bloody hell.
- Once again.

386
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:24,180
- Bloody hell.
- Bloody hell.

387
00:28:24,603 --> 00:28:26,203
Pooh devil!

388
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,795
Pooh devil.

389
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,940
Wait.

390
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,700
Pooh devil.

391
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,260
You can also say: To hell.

392
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:37,260
- Pooh devil.
- No! To hell!

393
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,060
To hell.

394
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:43,260
- You can also say devil be damned.
- Devil be damned?

395
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,780
- Devil be damned.
- Good.

396
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,580
And the worst is:
Go to hell.

397
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,060
- What did you say?
- Go to hell.

398
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,580
Go to hell.

399
00:28:52,012 --> 00:28:54,132
The devil should get you.

400
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:56,439
The devil should get you.

401
00:28:56,464 --> 00:28:58,064
Damn and blast it.

402
00:28:58,832 --> 00:29:00,672
Damn and blast it.

403
00:29:00,715 --> 00:29:03,860
Ida, shut up!
Darn rascal!

404
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,980
Should you teach
your sister to swear?

405
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,980
I didn't do that!

406
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:11,900
I just told her that she
can't say son of a bitch.

407
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:15,398
And then I told her
which other words are bad,

408
00:29:15,423 --> 00:29:19,210
and to watch out for
which other words.

409
00:29:19,346 --> 00:29:21,746
Yes, you should as well, Emil.

410
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,780
You should also watch out.
What a darn rascal!

411
00:29:26,149 --> 00:29:29,414
To teach his little
sister to swear. Ha!

412
00:29:29,456 --> 00:29:33,198
<i>It was a Saturday, on which
the auction had taken place,</i>

413
00:29:33,223 --> 00:29:37,683
<i>and now Emil was sleeping,
happy with his clever deals.</i>

414
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,773
<i>A short June night
came and went.</i>

415
00:29:47,722 --> 00:29:49,792
<i>A new day began.</i>

416
00:30:05,197 --> 00:30:10,251
Sunday. But the cows had to
be milked Sundays and weekdays.

417
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,140
My goodness! Now how do I look?

418
00:30:27,407 --> 00:30:29,327
How terrible.

419
00:30:42,021 --> 00:30:44,675
I can't show myself like this.

420
00:30:44,823 --> 00:30:46,619
What should I do?

421
00:30:51,587 --> 00:30:54,994
Yes, Ida, I think
it's nice of Emil,

422
00:30:55,027 --> 00:30:59,747
that he has given you the
box, even if it is worthless.

423
00:31:00,706 --> 00:31:04,220
And everybody makes
a few crazy deals in life.

424
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,380
You shouldn't blame anyone.

425
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,500
But Lina!

426
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:17,460
- Emil!
- There's no reason to laugh.

427
00:31:17,906 --> 00:31:19,188
Oh dear!

428
00:31:19,213 --> 00:31:22,205
Poor Lina, the way you look!

429
00:31:22,665 --> 00:31:25,165
You can't show yourself like this.

430
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:29,620
No, just today, when there's
Sunday coffee after church.

431
00:31:31,028 --> 00:31:34,931
Emil, go and ask Krösa-Maja if
she can help with the coffee.

432
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:41,140
Yes. I don't want to make
a spectacle of myself.

433
00:31:42,322 --> 00:31:46,049
That's terrible.
It must hurt a lot.

434
00:31:46,745 --> 00:31:48,987
Yes, and how!

435
00:31:49,148 --> 00:31:51,708
My head is about to burst.

436
00:31:51,925 --> 00:31:54,464
Then put some snuff
into the hollow tooth.

437
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:56,813
- That'll surely help.
- Do you think?

438
00:31:56,862 --> 00:32:00,302
Guaranteed.
Snuff is a drastic cure.

439
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,219
Oh!

440
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:04,780
- Well? Any better?
- No!

441
00:32:05,981 --> 00:32:08,901
Then I rather
keep the toothache.

442
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,940
Lina, we are all very sorry.

443
00:32:12,356 --> 00:32:14,653
But we must hurry now, Alma,

444
00:32:14,678 --> 00:32:17,638
otherwise we'll be
late for worship.

445
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,469
I'm ready.

446
00:32:19,494 --> 00:32:22,454
Set the table, Lina.
Take the flowered cups.

447
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,260
Emil, get on your way.

448
00:32:33,113 --> 00:32:39,269
<i>If you were ever in a forest in Smaland
on an early Sunday morning in June,</i>

449
00:32:39,784 --> 00:32:42,705
<i>then you will surely
remember how it is.</i>

450
00:32:43,231 --> 00:32:46,511
<i>The cuckoo calling and
the blackbird chirping,</i>

451
00:32:48,022 --> 00:32:52,222
<i>you feel how soft the grass
is under your bare feet,</i>

452
00:32:53,544 --> 00:32:56,637
<i>and how the sun warms your neck.</i>

453
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,660
Yes? Yes?

454
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,020
God help us, Emil.

455
00:33:19,256 --> 00:33:22,300
Typhus has come to Jönköping.

456
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:25,873
- Oh yeah?
- There, read it.

457
00:33:26,469 --> 00:33:29,260
"Two people in Jönköping"

458
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:33,940
"are, as we have just heard,
infected with typhus."

459
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:36,355
What is typhus? Like the plague?

460
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:39,020
That people just die from it?

461
00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:41,180
Yes, like the plague.

462
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,860
I don't know either.

463
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:46,300
I think at first they're
all blue in the face,

464
00:33:46,778 --> 00:33:48,535
and then they die.

465
00:33:53,545 --> 00:33:56,380
Shall we try the snuff again?

466
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,820
No thanks. I'd rather die.

467
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:04,819
Then you should go to the blacksmith.

468
00:34:06,993 --> 00:34:13,055
<i>Sme-Pelle was the blacksmith who
pulled out teeth with his dreadful pliers.</i>

469
00:34:13,227 --> 00:34:17,060
But you can't run around with
this toothache all the time.

470
00:34:17,523 --> 00:34:20,083
No, I really can't.

471
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:23,398
How much does Sme-Pelle
charge for pulling teeth?

472
00:34:23,444 --> 00:34:25,121
15 øre per hour.

473
00:34:25,694 --> 00:34:31,220
I could pull the tooth much faster
and cheaper than Sme-Pelle.

474
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,060
Don't you understand?

475
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:37,124
I gallop off, and tally-ho,
the tooth is already out.

476
00:34:37,311 --> 00:34:42,521
Tally-ho? No way.
You won't gallop off with me.

477
00:34:42,974 --> 00:34:45,662
The only thing you
know are pranks.

478
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,940
Oh, we should try it.

479
00:34:57,965 --> 00:35:00,405
Now all that's left is wait for the yank.

480
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:01,950
Yo!

481
00:35:02,637 --> 00:35:04,957
Now she has to run.

482
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,860
Stop!

483
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,700
Stop!

484
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,820
Stop!

485
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,900
Stop!

486
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:24,860
Stay put, Lina. Or you'll
never get rid of the tooth.

487
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:41,122
I'll be darned if I don't
get the tooth out.

488
00:35:41,924 --> 00:35:44,084
- Run, Lukas!
- Help!

489
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:49,860
- Hop, Lukas!
- Help!

490
00:35:50,111 --> 00:35:54,191
Stop! I don't want to hear
about your yanks anymore.

491
00:35:56,201 --> 00:35:58,041
Emil!

492
00:35:59,707 --> 00:36:02,667
Your yank didn't work.

493
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,175
Poor Lina.

494
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:07,998
Yes, my little one.

495
00:36:10,789 --> 00:36:14,229
I know I blew it myself.

496
00:36:15,959 --> 00:36:19,039
Oh, I was so scared.

497
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:23,280
All right. Then I'll try
to find something else.

498
00:36:24,623 --> 00:36:27,780
Yes, but not with
a jerk or a yank.

499
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:32,275
Certainly one can pull a tooth
with a bit more feeling.

500
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:35,830
There must be a
more gentle method.

501
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,320
Now you're making
a sour face again.

502
00:36:47,635 --> 00:36:50,166
Do you want to get
rid of the tooth?

503
00:36:50,236 --> 00:36:51,756
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

504
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:55,960
Now there's no yank.
I'll pull the tooth with "Drr".

505
00:36:56,789 --> 00:36:59,669
Slowly and with feeling,
as you wanted.

506
00:37:02,869 --> 00:37:05,269
It's about to do "Drr".

507
00:37:19,014 --> 00:37:21,454
No! I don't want that either!

508
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,351
Leave me alone with
your silly tooth.

509
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,620
I've done what I could.

510
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:40,300
Yes, thank you, Emil.
I know that.

511
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:44,800
Perhaps you'll find
something else we can do.

512
00:37:45,341 --> 00:37:48,200
Somehow I have to
get rid of that tooth.

513
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,320
Do you really want that, Lina?

514
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,000
Yes, you must understand.

515
00:37:53,673 --> 00:37:57,884
But I believe the fastest
method is still the best.

516
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:59,990
Do you think?

517
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,436
How about jumping into
the hay from up there?

518
00:38:16,465 --> 00:38:20,425
When you're half way, the
tooth flies out. Boom!

519
00:38:20,584 --> 00:38:22,584
Boom.

520
00:38:24,607 --> 00:38:26,447
Boom.

521
00:38:29,563 --> 00:38:31,443
Come here.

522
00:38:32,171 --> 00:38:34,291
This will get me killed.

523
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,129
Jump!

524
00:38:43,271 --> 00:38:47,564
No. I don't dare to jump.

525
00:38:48,222 --> 00:38:52,862
If you want to keep your old
tooth, you don't need to jump.

526
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:04,266
- What are you waiting for?
- Dear Lord!

527
00:39:04,428 --> 00:39:07,896
Come on, Lina!
Now jump!

528
00:39:08,037 --> 00:39:11,115
I'll help out a
bit, if you want.

529
00:39:11,413 --> 00:39:13,373
Yikes!

530
00:39:15,907 --> 00:39:17,879
Now look at this, Emil.

531
00:39:17,904 --> 00:39:20,446
You can pull pranks,

532
00:39:20,727 --> 00:39:24,487
but you can't pull a tooth.

533
00:40:07,133 --> 00:40:08,773
So here I am.

534
00:40:10,463 --> 00:40:14,103
Yes I see that.
And it's about time.

535
00:40:20,392 --> 00:40:22,552
He's doing it with a wham.

536
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,080
Open your mouth!

537
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:28,510
What is that?

538
00:40:28,535 --> 00:40:30,815
That doesn't look good, child.

539
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,280
Cough!

540
00:40:41,258 --> 00:40:43,738
What disease do I have?

541
00:40:45,534 --> 00:40:48,374
You have typhus, a bad disease.

542
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,280
First you'll get a blue face,

543
00:40:51,305 --> 00:40:53,594
and then you are dead,
says Krösa-Maja.

544
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:56,339
But I'm not blue in the face.

545
00:40:56,364 --> 00:40:58,164
No?

546
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:01,164
<i>Emil had an idea.</i>

547
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,680
<i>How could he give Ida the facial
color of a typhoid patient?</i>

548
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,760
Don't waste the ink.

549
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:12,560
Mother needs that to
write down your pranks.

550
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,180
Yes, I know that.

551
00:41:16,045 --> 00:41:18,145
What's that?

552
00:41:18,671 --> 00:41:23,960
"You're friendly invited to
the church coffee on Sunday,"

553
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:30,960
"Alma and Anton Svensson,
Katthult, Lönneberga."

554
00:41:33,183 --> 00:41:37,343
<i>This was the draft
letter of the invitation.</i>

555
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,863
<i>But it was no longer needed.</i>

556
00:41:39,888 --> 00:41:42,648
<i>Emil had good use for it.</i>

557
00:41:48,094 --> 00:41:51,574
Now I'll show you
what typhus is.

558
00:42:08,504 --> 00:42:10,504
Well? How are you, Lina?

559
00:42:10,706 --> 00:42:12,866
Does the tooth still hurt?

560
00:42:13,002 --> 00:42:16,480
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

561
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:19,256
What do you mean?

562
00:42:19,311 --> 00:42:22,490
Sme-Pelle threw the tooth
on the rubbish heap.

563
00:42:22,515 --> 00:42:25,248
Hopefully, the tooth
still screams in pain.

564
00:42:32,684 --> 00:42:35,084
Look! The tooth is out!

565
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:37,122
What's happening?

566
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,840
Was it bad?

567
00:42:40,052 --> 00:42:43,115
Yes, it hurt very much.

568
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:51,379
- Are you in there, Ida?
- Yes.

569
00:42:51,481 --> 00:42:56,059
- Don't you want to get out?
- I can't. I'm sick.

570
00:42:56,163 --> 00:42:58,583
What? For God's sake.

571
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:06,373
What's the matter?
What's wrong with you?

572
00:43:07,379 --> 00:43:09,219
It's typhus.

573
00:43:11,293 --> 00:43:13,693
Welcome!

574
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,557
If you please, Pastor?
Good day!

575
00:43:17,582 --> 00:43:19,462
A coffee will do us good.

576
00:43:19,832 --> 00:43:23,152
Get out!
We have typhus on the farm.

577
00:43:23,629 --> 00:43:26,152
- What?
- Typhus? That's impossible.

578
00:43:26,177 --> 00:43:29,958
What are you talking about?
Who has typhus?

579
00:43:30,029 --> 00:43:32,789
Who? Me!

580
00:43:32,854 --> 00:43:35,934
Oh, Ida!

581
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,280
I don't understand.

582
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,542
Don't you have typhus?

583
00:43:40,596 --> 00:43:44,236
No, Krösa-Maja, it
just looks like that.

584
00:43:44,261 --> 00:43:47,501
Surely you know who
painted my typhus.

585
00:43:47,526 --> 00:43:49,370
Emil!

586
00:43:49,556 --> 00:43:50,932
Where are you?

587
00:43:50,957 --> 00:43:52,597
Thanks, thank you.

588
00:43:53,395 --> 00:43:56,995
Just take it. Take
another piece of cake.

589
00:43:57,755 --> 00:44:00,635
- More coffee, Mr. Pastor?
- Yes, please.

590
00:44:11,502 --> 00:44:13,542
- Krösa-Maja.
- Ugh.

591
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:21,800
It's always Emil pulling
pranks on the farm.

592
00:44:22,506 --> 00:44:24,186
But don't worry.

593
00:44:24,211 --> 00:44:28,851
If the real typhus had come,
it would be even worse.

594
00:44:29,674 --> 00:44:32,760
Well. One of my old confirmands.

595
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,760
How are you, Lina?

596
00:44:34,808 --> 00:44:36,237
But what is it?

597
00:44:36,324 --> 00:44:38,784
Do you have a toothache?
Poor thing.

598
00:44:39,245 --> 00:44:41,432
But the tooth is already out!

599
00:44:41,457 --> 00:44:44,910
Don't be so sad.
We all make mistakes.

600
00:44:45,278 --> 00:44:49,965
This Emil! He should never
be let out of the shed again.

601
00:44:50,274 --> 00:44:51,954
What is this?

602
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:55,171
What's this?
Where do these letters come from?

603
00:44:55,233 --> 00:44:59,240
That's part of Emil's stuff.
He leaves everything lying around.

604
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,876
They belong to Emil?

605
00:45:00,901 --> 00:45:03,981
I've been searching for
this stamp for years.

606
00:45:04,169 --> 00:45:08,794
- They don't have any at the post office?
- Certainly. But this is a rare one.

607
00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:11,834
Could I buy them
for my collection?

608
00:45:11,975 --> 00:45:13,655
Yes. You can have it.

609
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,840
That's just some old stuff.

610
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,279
This isn't a joke. I'll pay you
40 crowns for the stamp.

611
00:45:19,304 --> 00:45:22,264
What? 40 crowns for
a small piece of paper?

612
00:45:22,555 --> 00:45:24,355
God forbid!

613
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:26,140
What? 40 crowns?

614
00:45:26,165 --> 00:45:29,625
I can buy almost half a cow for that.

615
00:45:29,661 --> 00:45:33,231
Half a cow?
Which end do you want to buy?

616
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,560
Do you want the mooing front,

617
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:38,560
or the tail wagging back?

618
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,160
Go straight to the shed, Emil.

619
00:45:41,185 --> 00:45:42,904
Hello, dear Emil.

620
00:45:42,929 --> 00:45:46,329
Tell me, where did you
get these letters from?

621
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,480
I bought them at the auction.

622
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,640
You know what I think, daddy?

623
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,080
I should go to
auctions more often.

624
00:45:56,105 --> 00:45:59,600
You're going to the shed
and nowhere else.

625
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:07,240
Pastor, look at this! Aahh!

626
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,000
Uh... wait, Emil. Wait. Wait!

627
00:46:32,432 --> 00:46:37,072
<i>Emil was sitting in the
shed all evening carving.</i>

628
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,520
<i>Suddenly it occurred to
him that it was Sunday.</i>

629
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:44,760
<i>To use a knife on a Sunday
seemed a sin to him.</i>

630
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:48,360
<i>So as he was standing at
the window of the shed,</i>

631
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:51,480
<i>he was thinking about his sins.</i>

632
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:56,560
<i>Surely one couldn't pull teeth
on a Sunday or paint people blue,</i>

633
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:01,360
<i>and he came to the decision
to start a better life.</i>

634
00:47:02,189 --> 00:47:08,269
<i>That's why he asked God
to make a good boy of him.</i>

635
00:47:10,501 --> 00:47:12,261
Help me, dear God.

636
00:47:12,341 --> 00:47:14,700
I want to be good in the future.

637
00:47:14,907 --> 00:47:17,297
I want to stop with the pranks.

638
00:47:17,322 --> 00:47:21,137
Emil Svensson,
Katthult, Lönneberga.

639
00:47:40,778 --> 00:47:44,200
Look how far I can jump, daddy.

640
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:50,560
Oh yes, a big casserole in the
stomach let's you really jump.

641
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:53,560
Do you dare to jump too?

642
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:56,280
Yes, I sure do.

643
00:48:00,281 --> 00:48:03,242
Well, you see? Hop!

644
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:07,772
I still excel in
jumping and running.

645
00:48:08,025 --> 00:48:09,985
Can you also jump from here?

646
00:48:10,041 --> 00:48:12,961
Yes, I could jump from there.

647
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:17,780
But I... I don't want
people to see me.

648
00:48:17,805 --> 00:48:21,285
I've ridiculed myself
often enough.

649
00:48:21,883 --> 00:48:24,403
I dare anyway.

650
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,124
You'll soon see
that I dare too.

651
00:48:29,149 --> 00:48:31,189
Watch out.

652
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:33,634
There I go!

653
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,440
I dare to jump from here as well.

654
00:48:41,058 --> 00:48:44,098
When I jump, you have
to catch me too.

655
00:48:51,692 --> 00:48:55,372
So, my dear friends, if
you see me here now,

656
00:48:55,688 --> 00:48:58,602
you will surely
believe I am crazy.

657
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:08,592
Now, however, we
have jumped enough.

658
00:49:08,702 --> 00:49:13,080
And, Emil? We don't tell mother.

659
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,600
No.

660
00:49:17,485 --> 00:49:20,750
<i>Emil tried to have as
much fun as possible.</i>

661
00:49:20,812 --> 00:49:27,077
<i>For soon a new wind would blow.
School would start for Emil.</i>

662
00:49:34,473 --> 00:49:36,361
Surely you will like it.

663
00:49:36,442 --> 00:49:38,082
Yes.

664
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,196
Beware of Emil.
He'll just teach you nonsense.

665
00:49:47,337 --> 00:49:49,814
- Can you really read?
- Yes.

666
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:52,080
Then read something.

667
00:49:55,825 --> 00:50:00,778
"The bear growled
fearously and..."

668
00:50:01,004 --> 00:50:03,500
No, Emil.

669
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:04,659
Fearously!

670
00:50:04,684 --> 00:50:09,364
<i>Emil could read, even though
he sometimes made mistakes.</i>

671
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:13,000
<i>And the teacher was
not the first to suspect...</i>

672
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:17,279
<i>that they had a future community-
chairman in the classroom.</i>

673
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:20,049
- <i>So hear and wonder...</i>
- Sit down!

674
00:50:20,088 --> 00:50:22,791
<i>Emil became top of his class.</i>

675
00:50:24,269 --> 00:50:27,269
Now, who are Jacob's sons?

676
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:31,210
Emil?

677
00:50:32,192 --> 00:50:34,232
Ruben, Simeon, Levi,

678
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:38,054
Judah, Dan, Naftali, Gad,

679
00:50:38,095 --> 00:50:39,935
Ascher, Issachar,

680
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:43,204
Zebulun, Joseph, and Benjamin.

681
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,320
Right, Emil.

682
00:50:47,647 --> 00:50:50,137
<i>Of course he still pulled pranks.</i>

683
00:50:50,162 --> 00:50:53,303
<i>But always the kind the
teacher liked to forgive.</i>

684
00:50:53,473 --> 00:50:57,732
<i>One day, however, he planned
something that no one had dared to do.</i>

685
00:50:57,782 --> 00:51:00,047
<i>At least not at this school.</i>

686
00:51:00,072 --> 00:51:03,329
<i>In Lönneberga it was talked
about long afterward.</i>

687
00:51:03,354 --> 00:51:05,821
<i>And it was like this:</i>

688
00:51:10,182 --> 00:51:13,582
Good, Emil.
Now you can sit down again.

689
00:51:21,414 --> 00:51:25,334
But Emil, now why
did you do that?

690
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:29,156
I've done this out
of my great goodness.

691
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:33,202
<i>This answer became a
popular quotation in Lönneberga.</i>

692
00:51:33,228 --> 00:51:36,938
<i>"I've done this out
of my great goodness",</i>

693
00:51:37,149 --> 00:51:40,446
<i>he said after kissing
the teacher.</i>

694
00:51:41,077 --> 00:51:43,265
You kissed the teacher!

695
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:47,760
Yes, and if you want,
I'll do it again.

696
00:51:48,223 --> 00:51:52,815
But he did not. There was
only this once and never again.

697
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:56,541
<i>The teacher was not angry
because of the kiss.</i>

698
00:51:57,018 --> 00:51:58,923
<i>No. Not at all.</i>

699
00:52:03,158 --> 00:52:05,598
<i>The first snow fell,</i>

700
00:52:05,775 --> 00:52:08,128
<i>and the women were
busy with the laundry.</i>

701
00:52:08,153 --> 00:52:11,513
<i>Because at Christmas
everything should be clean.</i>

702
00:52:20,874 --> 00:52:25,897
<i>On the day of Christmas Eve,
Alfred and Emil went into the forest...</i>

703
00:52:25,992 --> 00:52:30,304
<i>and fetched the most beautiful
fir that they could find.</i>

704
00:52:44,379 --> 00:52:48,019
<i>On a spring night something
terrible happened:</i>

705
00:52:48,342 --> 00:52:50,981
<i>Emil had a stomachache
and had to get out,</i>

706
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,320
<i>but that was not the
terrible thing.</i>

707
00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:59,250
<i>On the contrary, it was fortunate,
because the toilet was near the pigsty,</i>

708
00:52:59,391 --> 00:53:02,914
<i>and there the terrible
had thing happened.</i>

709
00:53:15,149 --> 00:53:17,789
You poor little piglet.

710
00:53:20,187 --> 00:53:22,600
Hey! Daddy!
Daddy, wake up! Quick!

711
00:53:22,625 --> 00:53:24,625
Daddy! Daddy!

712
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:30,190
Darn! What have you done now?

713
00:53:30,426 --> 00:53:32,986
Something terrible has happened.

714
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:36,183
<i>Yes, that's how it was.</i>

715
00:53:36,956 --> 00:53:39,923
<i>The sow that Emil's father
had bought at the auction,</i>

716
00:53:39,948 --> 00:53:42,658
<i>had given birth that night and
killed ten of the piglets.</i>

717
00:53:42,814 --> 00:53:46,681
<i>Something like this sometimes happens.</i>

718
00:53:47,274 --> 00:53:50,203
<i>She would have killed the eleventh,</i>

719
00:53:50,228 --> 00:53:53,681
<i>if Emil had not
passed by and saved it.</i>

720
00:53:57,170 --> 00:54:01,570
You poor little piglet.
What a bad mother you have.

721
00:54:01,737 --> 00:54:04,729
There seems to be only
wickedness in Backhorva.

722
00:54:04,754 --> 00:54:07,215
There's certainly a
curse on the cattle.

723
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:11,333
I'll look after the piglet.
I don't care if it's cursed.

724
00:54:12,873 --> 00:54:15,793
You always want to
have everything.

725
00:54:17,772 --> 00:54:20,371
<i>The father was to be pitied.</i>

726
00:54:20,396 --> 00:54:24,053
<i>A few days later the sow
was afflicted by a disease.</i>

727
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:28,341
- Now the sow is also dead.
- God shall protect us from evil.

728
00:54:28,461 --> 00:54:32,453
We shouldn't have gone to
this unfortunate auction.

729
00:54:32,496 --> 00:54:36,776
What did we get from it?
A single, small, miserable piglet.

730
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,320
And that may also die.

731
00:54:49,943 --> 00:54:52,287
How is the piglet?

732
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:55,478
It's restive.
It doesn't want to eat either.

733
00:54:55,503 --> 00:54:58,361
Well...
Why doesn't it eat?

734
00:54:59,887 --> 00:55:04,270
No idea. There has to be a
curse on him, daddy said.

735
00:55:04,387 --> 00:55:07,747
The poor piglet will
surely be dead soon.

736
00:55:07,944 --> 00:55:10,024
No, it won't die.

737
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:14,320
The piglet stays alive.
I'll take care of that.

738
00:55:15,915 --> 00:55:18,852
I just want to see
that before I believe it.

739
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:23,440
It won't die.
Because I said so.

740
00:55:25,269 --> 00:55:27,109
Yeah, yeah.

741
00:55:29,937 --> 00:55:31,615
<i>The days passed.</i>

742
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:35,249
<i>The small piglet grew and
became bigger and stronger.</i>

743
00:55:44,769 --> 00:55:49,289
<i>On a beautiful Sunday, the
shooting team of Hultsfred had...</i>

744
00:55:49,416 --> 00:55:53,829
<i>a morning meeting on the
cow pasture of Katthult.</i>

745
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:33,423
<i>Just this morning, Emil
had read in the newspaper...</i>

746
00:56:33,448 --> 00:56:35,446
<i>about the Smalander Hussars.</i>

747
00:56:35,554 --> 00:56:38,754
<i>And he wanted to
become a hussar as well.</i>

748
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,960
Hussars, ride an attack!

749
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,040
Lukas, run as fast as you can!

750
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:54,360
God protect our King
and our Fatherland!

751
00:56:55,759 --> 00:57:00,462
A powerful hurray for our
beloved royal house!

752
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:06,200
- Long lives!
- Hurray! Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!

753
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,798
- Help!

754
00:57:42,884 --> 00:57:45,880
Hurray! Smaland together!
An attack!

755
00:57:48,753 --> 00:57:52,160
- Pang! Pang!
- Quick! Seek shelter.

756
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,160
(Woman) Oskar!

757
00:58:04,714 --> 00:58:06,194
Oskar!

758
00:58:06,353 --> 00:58:08,524
Emil!

759
00:58:14,826 --> 00:58:17,626
Griseknoen! Come here!

760
00:58:19,221 --> 00:58:23,200
<i>Emil wasn't sitting
alone in the shed this summer.</i>

761
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:27,682
<i>Where Emil was, you could
be sure Griseknoen was too.</i>

762
00:58:27,808 --> 00:58:29,368
Come on!

763
00:58:31,582 --> 00:58:33,526
Come here!

764
00:58:35,932 --> 00:58:37,612
Come.

765
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:44,060
Lukas!

766
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:47,724
And there is something for you.

767
00:58:49,352 --> 00:58:50,952
Piggy!

768
00:58:51,344 --> 00:58:52,944
Piggy!

769
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:56,180
I have something for you.

770
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:59,643
But not so wild.

771
00:58:59,886 --> 00:59:01,237
Sit!

772
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:03,394
Sit! Come on, sit!

773
00:59:04,793 --> 00:59:06,832
Sit, piggy.

774
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:11,549
Emil!

775
00:59:16,516 --> 00:59:18,676
Sit! Sit!

776
00:59:20,464 --> 00:59:23,424
<i>Instead of carving figures,</i>

777
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:28,949
<i>Emil tried to teach the
piglet all sorts of tricks...</i>

778
00:59:28,974 --> 00:59:33,089
<i>that nobody in Smaland thought
possible for an ordinary pig to learn.</i>

779
00:59:33,221 --> 00:59:34,901
Watch it, piggy.

780
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,480
Sit. Sit.

781
00:59:37,919 --> 00:59:40,199
Yes, sit.

782
00:59:40,583 --> 00:59:42,263
Take it.

783
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:44,463
Sit.

784
00:59:45,554 --> 00:59:47,234
Sit, now take it.

785
00:59:47,774 --> 00:59:49,894
Good piggy, sit.

786
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:55,198
The piglet can't catch me!

787
00:59:55,323 --> 00:59:59,003
Hey, piglet, catch her!
Come, piglet.

788
00:59:59,295 --> 01:00:01,575
What's going on here?

789
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:04,021
Jumping around with a piglet!

790
01:00:04,046 --> 01:00:06,806
But the piglet finds it funny.

791
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:10,680
A piglet isn't there
to have fun.

792
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:13,267
There should be a
good Christmas ham.

793
01:00:13,292 --> 01:00:16,572
But when you jump around
with it, it becomes skinny.

794
01:00:17,081 --> 01:00:19,001
This is utter nonsense.

795
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:24,863
<i>Christmas ham!
Emil did not like that.</i>

796
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,506
You now know what you have to do.

797
01:00:27,531 --> 01:00:29,553
You just have to remain skinny.

798
01:00:29,578 --> 01:00:32,178
Then you'll always be happy.

799
01:00:37,571 --> 01:00:38,922
Jump!

800
01:00:39,173 --> 01:00:40,893
Jump, piggy!

801
01:00:45,704 --> 01:00:47,664
Now jump, piggy.

802
01:00:50,274 --> 01:00:52,800
Jump, piggy. Well done.

803
01:00:57,549 --> 01:00:59,681
Jump!

804
01:00:59,847 --> 01:01:02,047
What madness.

805
01:01:04,644 --> 01:01:07,564
Do you see, Ida?
Now he can do it.

806
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,040
And again!

807
01:01:34,770 --> 01:01:40,098
The piglet realized more and
more how beautiful life could be.

808
01:01:41,638 --> 01:01:45,238
Just wind up in a place
where there is an Emil.

809
01:01:56,392 --> 01:02:02,688
Emil sat there and thought about
how much he liked the piglet...

810
01:02:03,536 --> 01:02:06,456
and who else he liked.

811
01:02:07,976 --> 01:02:10,351
Well... first of course Alfred,

812
01:02:10,376 --> 01:02:13,047
and then Lukas and then Ida.

813
01:02:13,765 --> 01:02:17,185
And after the three...
the piglet.

814
01:02:17,279 --> 01:02:20,325
Oh, I forgot my mum!

815
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:23,769
Of course mum...

816
01:02:24,239 --> 01:02:28,035
But otherwise it is
Alfred, Lukas, Ida...

817
01:02:28,132 --> 01:02:30,332
and the piglet.

818
01:02:37,069 --> 01:02:39,949
And then we have
Father and Lina.

819
01:02:41,099 --> 01:02:44,459
Oh yes, I like daddy
on most days.

820
01:02:44,643 --> 01:02:46,924
But not on some other days.

821
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:49,594
And Lina?

822
01:02:49,619 --> 01:02:51,999
I really don't know.

823
01:02:52,977 --> 01:02:56,625
I don't like her,
nor dislike her.

824
01:02:56,699 --> 01:03:00,359
She belongs to us
just like the cat.

825
01:03:27,358 --> 01:03:31,678
So piggy? So far
you made it all right.

826
01:03:37,216 --> 01:03:40,957
It makes a lively impression
and has a good appetite.

827
01:03:40,982 --> 01:03:43,224
Yes, you did a
good thing, Emil.

828
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:47,966
This way you saved
your piglet twice.

829
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:53,120
How many times will I have to
save his life before he's mine?

830
01:03:54,849 --> 01:03:57,419
Now, don't pester
dad about it.

831
01:03:57,444 --> 01:04:01,484
You have Rolla and limping
Lotte since the auction.

832
01:04:02,045 --> 01:04:05,045
Let your father at
least have the piglet.

833
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:08,560
What's that supposed to mean?
There comes Mrs. Petrell!

834
01:04:09,405 --> 01:04:11,605
So?

835
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,756
What is the reason
for your visit?

836
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:23,425
I want to go to the pastorate,
but then I thought:

837
01:04:23,487 --> 01:04:25,772
Take a detour to Katthult.

838
01:04:25,944 --> 01:04:27,895
- How nice.
- You're welcome.

839
01:04:28,184 --> 01:04:31,168
Alma, what can we
offer Mrs. Petrell?

840
01:04:31,349 --> 01:04:34,333
No thanks.
I'm in a hurry.

841
01:04:34,503 --> 01:04:38,294
Can we give you some cherries?
We have so many.

842
01:04:38,328 --> 01:04:41,851
- Anton, go get some.
- Yes. Right away.

843
01:04:42,535 --> 01:04:46,055
Yes, you could
make wine from it.

844
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:49,017
Make cherry wine?
No way.

845
01:04:49,045 --> 01:04:52,454
Anton would be against it.
He's teetotaler.

846
01:04:52,738 --> 01:04:53,823
Oh?

847
01:04:53,949 --> 01:04:56,909
- He never drinks a glass of wine?
- No.

848
01:04:57,176 --> 01:05:01,336
I'd pay good money
for a bit of wine.

849
01:05:01,455 --> 01:05:04,119
- He does not need to know.
- Oh no!

850
01:05:04,183 --> 01:05:07,303
I would never do
it behind his back.

851
01:05:07,415 --> 01:05:10,855
But I could ask him.

852
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:13,099
Cherry wine?

853
01:05:13,130 --> 01:05:15,330
No. Not for anything in the world.

854
01:05:16,935 --> 01:05:18,415
All right.

855
01:05:18,629 --> 01:05:20,730
Do as you think best.

856
01:05:21,995 --> 01:05:26,115
Has she already said how much
she wants to pay? Not to little.

857
01:05:27,677 --> 01:05:30,317
See you when the wine is ready.

858
01:05:45,403 --> 01:05:48,203
Careful you don't
get a stomach ache.

859
01:05:54,018 --> 01:05:56,238
The piglet follows him like a dog.

860
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:59,480
Come here!
You can taste strawberries.

861
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:00,964
No thanks.

862
01:06:01,010 --> 01:06:04,050
I want to know how you
managed to do that.

863
01:06:04,287 --> 01:06:06,167
There's nothing to it.

864
01:06:06,192 --> 01:06:08,752
With a bit of cleverness
and a few potatoes...

865
01:06:08,777 --> 01:06:11,268
you can teach a piglet
almost everything.

866
01:06:11,402 --> 01:06:12,913
Sit! Sit!

867
01:06:12,938 --> 01:06:15,163
Sit! Very good!

868
01:06:18,615 --> 01:06:21,255
Sit! Sit!

869
01:06:21,943 --> 01:06:24,480
So, that's good.
And now...

870
01:06:28,106 --> 01:06:30,786
Paw. Very good.

871
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:34,040
Oh, isn't that cute?

872
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:38,245
Indeed. I find it quite
peculiar for a piglet.

873
01:06:38,298 --> 01:06:40,696
Paw. Good piggy.

874
01:06:40,749 --> 01:06:43,509
Isn't our piggy sweet, Emil?

875
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:46,240
And jump!

876
01:06:49,929 --> 01:06:51,729
And jump!

877
01:06:51,754 --> 01:06:53,434
Well done, piggy.

878
01:06:54,936 --> 01:06:58,376
There's only one piglet
like him in Lönneberga.

879
01:06:58,518 --> 01:07:01,516
And there won't ever be
someone as crazy like you.

880
01:07:01,541 --> 01:07:03,301
I hope so.

881
01:07:16,019 --> 01:07:18,511
<i>Every day Ida and Emil brought...</i>

882
01:07:18,536 --> 01:07:21,348
<i>the afternoon coffee
to the harvest helpers.</i>

883
01:07:21,373 --> 01:07:23,995
<i>For it was drunk in the fields.</i>

884
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:25,641
<i>This was everywhere,</i>

885
01:07:25,666 --> 01:07:29,111
<i>and everywhere the
children brought the coffee.</i>

886
01:09:08,468 --> 01:09:12,234
When you touch the
ground, you're dead.

887
01:09:12,426 --> 01:09:14,946
But you too.

888
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:25,069
<i>The cherry wine for Mrs.
Petrell was fermented,</i>

889
01:09:25,094 --> 01:09:28,859
<i>and since Emil's father was
in the field during the day,</i>

890
01:09:29,099 --> 01:09:32,466
<i>the mother took the opportunity
to put the wine in bottles.</i>

891
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:35,097
<i>Thus the father didn't
need to feel a sinner,</i>

892
01:09:35,122 --> 01:09:37,645
<i>for wine being made at his place.</i>

893
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:43,200
I'll be glad when I finally
get the stuff out of the house.

894
01:09:55,816 --> 01:09:57,856
Good you are back.

895
01:09:57,967 --> 01:10:00,897
Emil, be so kind and bury
the residues of the fruit there,

896
01:10:00,922 --> 01:10:03,272
where we always put the garbage.

897
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:06,400
Did they enjoye the coffee?

898
01:10:06,425 --> 01:10:08,214
Yes, especially daddy.

899
01:10:08,324 --> 01:10:10,280
Yes?

900
01:10:10,815 --> 01:10:12,615
Our daddy.

901
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:19,200
Hey, piggy!

902
01:10:19,257 --> 01:10:22,866
Are you thinking I'll give
you something to eat?

903
01:10:24,428 --> 01:10:27,748
That's not for you.
This is to throw away.

904
01:10:30,368 --> 01:10:32,768
But why should I bury it?

905
01:10:32,793 --> 01:10:35,033
I might as well give it to you.

906
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,280
Because you are so
crazy about cherries.

907
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:40,180
Well? Do you like it?

908
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:57,704
<i>The cock liked cherries
just as much as the piglet.</i>

909
01:10:57,729 --> 01:11:00,711
<i>But the hens weren't
allowed to taste.</i>

910
01:11:17,381 --> 01:11:19,506
<i>But suddenly...</i>

911
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,750
What is wrong with you?

912
01:11:21,788 --> 01:11:25,141
Why do you lie down
at this time of the day?

913
01:11:31,601 --> 01:11:35,401
<i>Suddenly, the cock
behaved like a madman.</i>

914
01:11:38,855 --> 01:11:41,635
What's got in to our cock?

915
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:47,760
And our piglet has
also lost his mind.

916
01:11:54,813 --> 01:11:56,320
<i>Poor hens.</i>

917
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:59,250
<i>Bad enough that their
cock behaved strangely,</i>

918
01:11:59,275 --> 01:12:03,900
<i>but that a wild pig was running
after them was too much.</i>

919
01:12:22,628 --> 01:12:24,828
<i>Yes, that was really too much.</i>

920
01:12:24,853 --> 01:12:28,126
<i>Emil knew you can
be scared to death.</i>

921
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:30,280
What will mother say?

922
01:12:33,045 --> 01:12:35,191
All chickens are dead.

923
01:12:46,963 --> 01:12:49,040
Poor Lotte.

924
01:12:49,157 --> 01:12:53,917
<i>It was over with limping
Lotte and her many eggs.</i>

925
01:12:54,427 --> 01:12:57,083
<i>The only thing Emil
could do for her was,</i>

926
01:12:57,108 --> 01:12:59,568
<i>to bury her decently.</i>

927
01:13:00,093 --> 01:13:04,211
<i>He already knew what should
be written on her tombstone.</i>

928
01:13:06,264 --> 01:13:08,664
"Here rests limping Lotte."

929
01:13:08,971 --> 01:13:13,011
"She was scared
to death by a piglet."

930
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:19,160
You should be ashamed of yourself!

931
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:21,544
First you scared
the hens to death...

932
01:13:21,569 --> 01:13:24,700
and then you continue eating
as if nothing has happened.

933
01:13:31,241 --> 01:13:33,492
Why are you swinging back and forth?

934
01:13:42,309 --> 01:13:46,669
And you, cock, suddenly
got rid of all your wives.

935
01:13:47,468 --> 01:13:49,348
Aren't you sad?

936
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:52,360
Aren't you ashamed?

937
01:13:53,975 --> 01:13:58,015
Well! That's no reason
to keep over.

938
01:14:00,322 --> 01:14:02,442
What's wrong with you?

939
01:14:02,656 --> 01:14:06,507
Maybe something was wrong
with the cherries? Could be.

940
01:14:19,861 --> 01:14:23,095
No. They taste good.

941
01:14:24,502 --> 01:14:28,702
How did Mother get the
idea of burying them?

942
01:14:36,643 --> 01:14:38,763
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

943
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:54,320
Now stop!
Sing to Alfred another time.

944
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:58,240
Now where is Emil?
Where can he be?

945
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:00,520
Please take a look where he is.

946
01:15:00,748 --> 01:15:03,428
Isn't he in the shed as usual?

947
01:15:04,322 --> 01:15:06,346
No, he isn't there today.

948
01:15:06,527 --> 01:15:08,447
- Come on!
- Yes.

949
01:15:12,387 --> 01:15:14,107
Not hungry, Krösa-Maja?

950
01:15:14,693 --> 01:15:17,044
I've had enough.

951
01:15:17,069 --> 01:15:19,029
I notice that I am getting old.

952
01:15:19,054 --> 01:15:21,621
Also my back hurts
more and more.

953
01:15:21,646 --> 01:15:25,646
"Behind the stove sits a mouse.
You have to get out."

954
01:15:26,657 --> 01:15:30,520
When we step it up, we'll be finished
with the rye harvest tomorrow.

955
01:15:30,795 --> 01:15:35,396
Yes. If it doesn't rain.
So it would seem.

956
01:15:39,498 --> 01:15:41,818
So what's going on?

957
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Why do you stand there?
Did something happen?

958
01:15:45,485 --> 01:15:48,765
Yes. Something did happen.

959
01:15:49,438 --> 01:15:52,615
Um... it's just hard to
say what happened.

960
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,720
Yes...

961
01:15:55,557 --> 01:15:57,520
In any case, our hens are dead.

962
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,760
- What? Our hens are dead?
- Dead?

963
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:02,880
And... uh...
the cock is drunk.

964
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:06,240
- Drunk?
- And... uh...

965
01:16:06,788 --> 01:16:10,195
The piglet is also... drunk.

966
01:16:11,202 --> 01:16:14,570
And as for Emil, he is also...

967
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,240
Yes?

968
01:16:19,081 --> 01:16:20,299
Emil is...

969
01:16:20,324 --> 01:16:22,364
Yes, what about our Emil?

970
01:16:23,699 --> 01:16:25,499
He's also drunk.

971
01:16:49,550 --> 01:16:51,886
- Emil!
- No!

972
01:16:53,038 --> 01:16:55,040
- Emil!
- What did I say?

973
01:16:55,354 --> 01:16:59,000
How is that possible? What
knocked the poor boy over like that?

974
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:01,635
- He smells of alcohol.
- Yes.

975
01:17:01,705 --> 01:17:03,800
- Oh, my boy!
- Such a misery!

976
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:06,000
- I'll take him.
- My Emil!

977
01:17:07,447 --> 01:17:09,160
Can I help?

978
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:12,138
- I'll help you.
- I'd better carry him alone.

979
01:17:12,224 --> 01:17:13,735
Maybe water helps.

980
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:16,400
- We'll find something.
- No, no water.

981
01:17:18,049 --> 01:17:21,578
Krösa-Maja ran straight
away and told everyone,

982
01:17:21,603 --> 01:17:24,853
what bad things had happened.

983
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:32,680
Oh, my boy. My poor boy.

984
01:17:32,705 --> 01:17:35,105
Alma, everything will be all right.

985
01:17:35,130 --> 01:17:38,290
Come on, Alfred.
Carry him up into the room.

986
01:17:38,324 --> 01:17:41,831
No, fresh air is better
for him. Believe me.

987
01:17:41,856 --> 01:17:45,340
- No.
- Better leave this to Alfred.

988
01:17:45,543 --> 01:17:48,699
He knows better than you and me.

989
01:17:48,724 --> 01:17:50,564
Well, come, Emil.

990
01:18:27,073 --> 01:18:29,753
Yes. That's right, Emil.

991
01:18:31,532 --> 01:18:34,438
<i>Alfred sat all evening
on the bench...</i>

992
01:18:34,533 --> 01:18:37,626
<i>and had Emil on his lap.</i>

993
01:18:37,939 --> 01:18:40,524
<i>He helped him, when
he had to throw up,</i>

994
01:18:40,634 --> 01:18:43,954
<i>and consoled him when he
wept over his wickedness.</i>

995
01:18:44,376 --> 01:18:46,876
<i>Emil had heard
that he was drunk,</i>

996
01:18:47,048 --> 01:18:49,727
<i>but he didn't know
how it had happened.</i>

997
01:18:49,752 --> 01:18:53,032
<i>He didn't know that
cherries, when they ferment,</i>

998
01:18:53,057 --> 01:18:57,177
<i>are full of the stuff that
can make you drunk.</i>

999
01:18:57,232 --> 01:19:00,152
Listen! Let me tell
you something.

1000
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,397
The Svenssons in Katthult.

1001
01:19:02,429 --> 01:19:05,021
Emil, the villain, got drunk...

1002
01:19:05,046 --> 01:19:07,061
and slaughtered all the hens.

1003
01:19:07,086 --> 01:19:09,766
Such misery. Such misery!

1004
01:19:11,041 --> 01:19:13,840
<i>The sun went
down, it was dark.</i>

1005
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:16,348
<i>The moon looked down
at Katthult farm,</i>

1006
01:19:16,457 --> 01:19:20,177
<i>and Alfred still
had Emil in his arm.</i>

1007
01:19:21,482 --> 01:19:23,402
So how are you, Emil?

1008
01:19:23,568 --> 01:19:25,935
I'm still alive.

1009
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:28,920
But if I die, you'll get Lukas.

1010
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,289
Oh. Nobody died of it yet.

1011
01:19:32,314 --> 01:19:34,674
You can believe me, Emil.

1012
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:42,024
Listen! Listen! Hey!

1013
01:19:42,049 --> 01:19:46,489
Emil from Katthult...
He got drunk. I know!

1014
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:49,920
Did you hear?
Emil got drunk.

1015
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,520
- Yes.
- And killed all the hens.

1016
01:19:52,545 --> 01:19:54,520
Come here! Come here!

1017
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:57,132
Emil from Katthult
farm got drunk...

1018
01:19:57,157 --> 01:19:59,757
and slaughtered all the hens.

1019
01:20:30,787 --> 01:20:33,107
You poor limping Lotte.

1020
01:20:33,992 --> 01:20:36,593
Oh, goodness gracious!

1021
01:20:43,090 --> 01:20:45,815
<i>Ida didn't know what to think.</i>

1022
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,910
<i>Perhaps she had magic hands.</i>

1023
01:20:47,935 --> 01:20:52,208
<i>Yes, perhaps she could bring
back the dead with her hands.</i>

1024
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:57,760
Hocus-pocus...

1025
01:20:59,207 --> 01:21:00,852
now you're no longer dead.

1026
01:21:00,877 --> 01:21:05,317
The hens had
only fainted with fright,

1027
01:21:05,356 --> 01:21:07,236
when the piglet ran after them.

1028
01:21:07,261 --> 01:21:09,430
That's something hens do.

1029
01:21:11,058 --> 01:21:13,659
Hocus-pocus...

1030
01:21:20,562 --> 01:21:22,962
Hocus-pocus...

1031
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:35,480
Hocus-pocus...

1032
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:45,560
Hocus-pocus...

1033
01:21:49,149 --> 01:21:51,429
Hocus-pocus...

1034
01:21:54,442 --> 01:21:57,402
Hocus-pocus...

1035
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:14,907
Just imagine: I've brought
all the hens back to life.

1036
01:22:23,571 --> 01:22:26,657
<i>The next morning everyone
was on their feet again:</i>

1037
01:22:26,682 --> 01:22:29,642
<i>Emil and the cock
and the piglet.</i>

1038
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:35,189
<i>But the cock couldn't
crow for three days,</i>

1039
01:22:35,214 --> 01:22:37,674
<i>although he tried again and again.</i>

1040
01:22:45,416 --> 01:22:47,955
<i>The hens looked so reproachful,</i>

1041
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:51,500
<i>that he disappeared in
the high grass ashamed.</i>

1042
01:22:54,980 --> 01:22:57,600
You can walk normal again.

1043
01:22:58,355 --> 01:23:02,260
To get drunk with
the piglet and lay down.

1044
01:23:03,148 --> 01:23:05,988
You are a real drunkard!

1045
01:23:09,187 --> 01:23:12,437
<i>Emil's mother wrote in
the blue notebook:</i>

1046
01:23:12,522 --> 01:23:15,201
"God help me with this poor boy."

1047
01:23:15,889 --> 01:23:18,855
"Today he was at least sober."

1048
01:23:20,115 --> 01:23:22,840
<i>But that's not the
end of the story yet.</i>

1049
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:27,130
<i>In the afternoon a car
came to Katthult.</i>

1050
01:23:27,419 --> 01:23:29,526
<i>There were three
serious-looking gentlemen.</i>

1051
01:23:29,551 --> 01:23:34,040
<i>Three Good-Templars from
Lönneberga, who came to visit Emil.</i>

1052
01:23:34,718 --> 01:23:37,898
<i>Now you certainly don't
know what Good-Templars are.</i>

1053
01:23:38,257 --> 01:23:42,773
<i>But I can tell you that there used
to be such people in Lönneberga...</i>

1054
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:45,590
<i>and were very
necessary in Smaland.</i>

1055
01:23:45,615 --> 01:23:48,107
<i>The Good-Templars
were determined,</i>

1056
01:23:48,169 --> 01:23:50,247
<i>the stop the horrible drinking,</i>

1057
01:23:50,325 --> 01:23:53,177
<i>which used to make so
many people unhappy...</i>

1058
01:23:53,251 --> 01:23:56,200
<i>and certainly still does so today.</i>

1059
01:23:58,632 --> 01:24:02,699
It has come to our attention that
not everything is in order here.

1060
01:24:02,765 --> 01:24:06,608
- What do you mean, please?
- We are thinking of Emil.

1061
01:24:06,729 --> 01:24:09,510
Did Emil do something? Hm?

1062
01:24:09,826 --> 01:24:12,175
They say he was drunk yesterday.

1063
01:24:13,121 --> 01:24:16,241
Well, listen.
That is exaggerated!

1064
01:24:17,244 --> 01:24:20,111
Surely you have been told
that it came to this,

1065
01:24:20,369 --> 01:24:23,855
because he has tasted cherries
from which I made wine.

1066
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:26,512
Yes, and it wouldn't hurt,

1067
01:24:26,793 --> 01:24:30,160
when he would listen to a
sermon about soberness.

1068
01:24:30,521 --> 01:24:32,040
Today is a meeting.

1069
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:37,120
After he got to the taste, it
would only be for his best.

1070
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:41,295
Well, okay.
Then I'll go with him.

1071
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:44,835
No way. If necessary,
I'll go with you.

1072
01:24:45,788 --> 01:24:49,545
I made the wine, Anton.
You shall not suffer because of this.

1073
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:52,920
I will attend your campaign
against the alcohol.

1074
01:24:53,369 --> 01:24:57,840
And I could bring Emil,
should you consider it necessary.

1075
01:24:57,920 --> 01:24:59,480
Come, Anton.

1076
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:01,552
Yes.

1077
01:25:01,577 --> 01:25:03,457
Goodbye.

1078
01:25:06,577 --> 01:25:08,497
See you.

1079
01:25:19,722 --> 01:25:23,026
Emil didn't mind.

1080
01:25:23,056 --> 01:25:26,547
It could be quite nice
to be among people.

1081
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:39,640
No, Griseknoen, you're not coming!

1082
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:41,520
Go home!

1083
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:46,000
Go home, I said.

1084
01:27:23,509 --> 01:27:26,749
First of all, you didn't
drink one glass...

1085
01:27:31,652 --> 01:27:34,132
and secondly, it was my fault.

1086
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,360
We have seen how alcohol...

1087
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:44,776
has ruined people's prospects.

1088
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:50,240
How it turns youthful innocence
into vice and shamelessness...

1089
01:27:50,980 --> 01:27:54,737
and how it lets the power
of manhood vanish.

1090
01:27:56,432 --> 01:27:58,487
So I ask you:

1091
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:01,480
Will you, Emil Svensson,

1092
01:28:01,851 --> 01:28:06,640
for the rest of your life,
take the vow of sobriety?

1093
01:28:07,212 --> 01:28:09,440
Yes, I could do that.

1094
01:28:10,176 --> 01:28:14,080
Our mission is to warn
people for the consequences...

1095
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:17,360
Piggy! You shouldn't be here.

1096
01:28:28,442 --> 01:28:31,040
Impossible. What is that?

1097
01:28:31,078 --> 01:28:33,358
This is our piglet.

1098
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:37,920
Take it out.
A pig doesn't belong here.

1099
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,080
Actually, it must
also take a vow.

1100
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:45,402
After all, it ate more cherries
than I did. Sit, piggy!

1101
01:28:46,751 --> 01:28:48,775
Yes, good.

1102
01:28:50,750 --> 01:28:53,251
You have to be a good piggy.

1103
01:28:54,412 --> 01:28:56,932
Sit... paw.

1104
01:28:57,044 --> 01:28:59,564
Yes. Good.

1105
01:29:00,410 --> 01:29:04,650
- Here. Because you are so obedient.
- This can't be true!

1106
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:07,776
<i>Everybody was just
looking at the piglet...</i>

1107
01:29:07,823 --> 01:29:11,080
<i>and they were almost
forgetting about the vow.</i>

1108
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:15,560
So what about the vow?
Or shall we just forget it?

1109
01:29:15,695 --> 01:29:19,615
...to renounce alcoholic
beverages for all times...

1110
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:23,320
...to renounce alcoholic
beverages for all times...

1111
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:26,493
and to help our
fellow human beings...

1112
01:29:26,533 --> 01:29:30,088
and to help our
fellow human beings...

1113
01:29:30,174 --> 01:29:34,520
- that they too become sober.
- that they too become sober.

1114
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:37,514
Griseknoen, this also
applies to you.

1115
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:07,640
Well, Emil?
There you are again.

1116
01:30:07,922 --> 01:30:09,977
I've taken a vow.

1117
01:30:10,288 --> 01:30:14,528
I have vowed to be sober
throughout my whole life.

1118
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:17,746
Then I'll tell you
something, Emil.

1119
01:30:18,051 --> 01:30:22,691
If you do, you'll get
the damn piglet.

1120
01:30:23,677 --> 01:30:25,240
For real?

1121
01:30:25,617 --> 01:30:26,695
Yes.

1122
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:31,640
Besides, I don't think
there won't be any good ham.

1123
01:30:32,348 --> 01:30:34,708
Oh, thank you, father.

1124
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:41,000
I would never have drunk
alcohol without the piglet.

1125
01:30:41,705 --> 01:30:45,800
The next day, Mrs. Petrell
came to pick up the wine,

1126
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:48,453
and Emil's mother was glad,

1127
01:30:48,507 --> 01:30:52,627
that his father was
now on the rye field.

1128
01:31:01,226 --> 01:31:04,946
- Hello, Alma!
- Welcome!

1129
01:31:05,380 --> 01:31:07,100
Welcome.

1130
01:31:07,249 --> 01:31:10,178
- Is the wine ready?
- Yes, it is.

1131
01:31:21,137 --> 01:31:23,973
But what are you doing, Emil?

1132
01:31:23,998 --> 01:31:27,036
I'm supposed to
ensure sobriety.

1133
01:31:27,591 --> 01:31:30,360
And so I thought I'd
start with Mrs. Petrell.
