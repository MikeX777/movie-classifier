1
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:50,398
THE FIRST CRY

2
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:21,676
I just tell Gaby that today's baby was born Cristina with a dolphin. It was so exciting!

3
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,472
My name is Adriana. For over 30 years I am a midwife in Mexico.

4
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,076
And my passion is the interplay between babies and dolphins.

5
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:05,799
Gaby  already know that the dolphin emits ultrasounds with its sonar. Now discovered that these vibrations soothe and stimulate the baby.

6
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,872
Dolphin reacts well Condo presence of Gaby.

7
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:19,548
Does the baby will be born today Gaby?
I do not know. But she is prepared.

8
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:26,554
Today is a special day. There will be a total eclipse of the Sun.

9
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:32,789
I believe that the planets influence the birth, think of all the women the world they're at the end of pregnancy.

10
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,719
Imagine them on track Shadow of the Moon, ready to give birth Condo.

11
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,392
And think of all babies, they'll cry for the first time. As with all of us.

12
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:03,990
Gaby wants to have the child in the sea. I take her to discover this Caribbean beach.

13
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,711
The ideal place for a natural childbirth. Discreet and intimate.

14
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,475
Are delighted decides that your baby will be born here.

15
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,915
We live here with 4 other couples a large house close to this magnificent lake, in the northern United States.

16
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:04,669
I think we do a nice pair. I, Vanessa Quebec.
And he, the American Michael ... my love.

17
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:18,633
I bet this will be our last ride boat, the two. Yes, today we will be three.

18
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:31,430
We call it  Lilicoy, "Fruit of passion" (passion fruit) in Hawaiian. Will be born in our house with our friends without medical help or a midwife.

19
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:37,914
It is called this a "free birth".
A baby's eclipse, I like the idea.

20
00:08:52,920 --> 00:09:00,954
I have pains, and I know my baby is coming. I asked to my mother me to paint the body. Bonita R I want to be your arrival.

21
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,550
Kencro stand beside me, with our first two children.

22
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,919
My name is  Majtonr'e. I am indigenous Kayapo the Amazon jungle.

23
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,309
We must remove everything is negative. I want to Gaby release your fears.

24
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,757
So with his head under water she discovers the excitement of
fetus in amniotic fluid.

25
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,629
... and faces the anguish birth, to live and to eliminate them.

26
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,875
Javier's father, is with us.

27
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:38,598
A village midwife has experience. Touch my baby and says it's time.

28
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,992
Fortunately  already got some plants to alleviate pain. A massage with them will do me good.

29
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,350
Given the proximity  delivery ... well ... I see that Michael is worried.

30
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:28,791
And if things go wrong... He talk much with others.

31
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:36,590
In general, the reaction is obvious:
The real danger is not the nature, but the hospital and all the technological interventions.

32
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:42,439
Women have always  Condo light. They got that strength.

33
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:47,198
And I know that you can give birth following the hearing of my body.

34
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,553
Kencro already sees the Pokecro our son as a hunter.

35
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,635
My name is Mane. I grew up with my people the Sahara.

36
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:46,993
I know the desert well. I'm a nomad. It is impossible to get lost here, if you're a Tuareg.

37
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:53,069
Nearly two years I married Mohammed. He pitched camp near a well.

38
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,990
And we'll wait here the arrival of our first child.

39
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:44,676
Baby Gaby is underway. Labor begins in the pool, but even before birth, going to the beach which is 5 minutes away.

40
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,390
Gaby is calm. I merely guide it with some exercises.

41
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,599
I admit that drag the rest community for my adventure.

42
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,834
I am pleased that Michael can talk to women who made the same choice I made.

43
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,154
Together, we fight for a fairer world ... and here, with the Parliament of Maine.

44
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:23,270
Today, take control of birth my son is following in that direction. It is the Claims a free woman.

45
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:35,114
Jose Luis is our doctor. He has made hundreds deliveries under water. There's only intervention if necessary.

46
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:42,639
It is our privilege to let Gaby will fully enjoy the process of motherhood. We're only here to admire the miracle of life.

47
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:56,194
Michael asks himself it should feel nervous, but know that I trust in my decision ...  let him calmer.

48
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:11,997
Jose Luis is on the beach to prepare all the material. Soon we will have with him.

49
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,198
Baby is born. We have no time to go to the beach.

50
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,358
It is a girl.
If welcome, Natalie.

51
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,915
Santiago is the eldest brother, now. Also need to take care of it. So I ask you that name or give Condo sister.

52
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:48,392
My name is Hung. I am a gynecologist at the hospital Ho Chi Minh City for 10 years. Already helped many babies being born.

53
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:55,832
It is simple: we are the largest motherhood in the world.
45,000 deliveries per year. What gives 120 babies a day.

54
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,473
Here in Vietnam  that women prefer
Condo Give birth at the hospital. And I think that's good.

55
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:07,955
Fact, statistics prove that things go better now than when they went home. Here saved many lives.

56
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:31,240
It is usually easier to hear it ... Putting it down.

57
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:39,040
- You heard him earlier?
- Now I have a small contraction.

58
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:57,838
Okay, you have contractions. My intuition was right. I was told it would be today. This proves that the baby and I we understand.

59
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:45,558
I joined Michael, Lauren, Keith and others the last time. Again I tell you that I am confident and know what to do.

60
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,832
True, there is a risk. Death is part the birth process.

61
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,834
If by chance there is a serious complication ... accept all consequences.
Such is life.

62
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:39,351
I want you to know ... that's life. You should not feel responsible. It is how I see things.

63
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:15,397
I'm not from Varanasi. I left the field because quer'iamoos a better life, but still so poor as before.

64
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:22,311
We live in a vacant lot with my parents, on the banks of the Ganges. Gather the cow dung. What is sacred fuel.

65
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:31,150
My husband has a Pedicabs.
We already have a big girl Puja,

66
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,397
a boy Arjul,

67
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:44,152
and Artie is the youngest. We hope the is the last quarter.

68
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,958
My name is Sunita.

69
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,997
Hello?

70
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,914
- Hello?! Already begun to be born?
- Yes!

71
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,519
It's very exciting!

72
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,393
The pool is warm?

73
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:45,112
Ethan is to fill it. We light the fireplace and has begun! Resumed contractions, I'll stop talking for a while.

74
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:55,719
- Can keep us informed overnight?
- Of course, we call when born.

75
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,270
- They can speak in any language.
- Whether in English, French, Portuguese, we call.

76
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,469
Wait ... The Father is there with you?

77
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,829
- Dad...
- Is it time?
- There.

78
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:19,232
- You're already in labor? You'll call a midwife or will you have him alone?

79
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:26,077
Now we are late to talk about it, Daddy. I told you before.

80
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,679
- Never know what you can do.

81
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:41,152
- Do not worry.
- Well, yes, my God! I'll try.
- Okay. Oh, Daddy.

82
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,156
- A kiss. Good luck
- Thanks.

83
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,078
There.

84
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:27,592
I can not go to a hospital, would be a catastrophe. Physicians are always a cesarean ... to bring more money.

85
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,598
And we almost did not what to eat ... So come see the midwife of the neighborhood here. She does not take much.

86
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:43,313
I feel better. She says it's not a girl. We already have two, and gifts for girls cost much in India.

87
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:51,355
Advised me to eat sugar before delivery with butter and hot milk to help the baby come down.

88
00:32:53,600 --> 00:33:00,839
Tells me not to worry. Will give me a shot and it will be okay. If something happens, will be here with me.

89
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:07,717
She also says women, who come to her house crying, out laughing.

90
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:22,879
It is normal to have so much pain? Nobody tells me anything...
Gotta find the strength to get up and go to the shelter.

91
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:27,551
women should not give birth in tents because that is where we sleep with men.

92
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,117
It's tradition. I'll have my baby in the desert sands.

93
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:06,595
My baby is coming. Midwife gives me rice to have luck. It is a custom.

94
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:51,949
It  night... and I'm afraid. My mom and camellias 're here to help me.

95
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:48,238
Sandhi, another girl. I'll do the operation for not having more children. Four arrive already.

96
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,799
Help me, Mom! It hurts me so much ...

97
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,236
I'm exhausted.

98
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,274
I hear them talking to Mohammed.

99
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:15,152
If it were to seek because there is a problem. However, respected the ritual.

100
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:30,316
My God, take this goat as an offering and protect our lives.

101
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:29,631
I see the images of the eclipse on TV. And I think we should have an influence on births.

102
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:34,795
It seems that all women from the region decided to give birth tonight. It is amazing.

103
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,594
Faneck, the name Michael invented for a boy.

104
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,158
We're so alone, in desert.

105
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:20,477
God decided to take my son. I have to accept.

106
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:49,431
- It is wonderful! How is he?
- Okay.
- It takes time to make a Man

107
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,715
- Well, born RS 4 hours.
- Born RS 4?
- Yes, but ...

108
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,918
I can hear it

109
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:11,952
- But I left the placenta.
- I drove out to? You not have asked for a midwife to come and collect?

110
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:18,714
Well... Perhaps we will.

111
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:26,673
- How is the baby? Has long hair?
- Very much, as Michael.
- How Michael?
- Yes, exactly like him.

112
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:33,442
- I'll see if expelled this placenta ...
- Okay.

113
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:42,595
Faneck was born 3 hours ago and the placenta still not left. Everyone is worried because they know I am in danger of hemorrhaging.

114
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:41,314
Michael decides Condo  call his mother. She had five children, should know.

115
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:50,556
Tell us what we can not wait, we should go to hospital immediately.

116
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:57,560
Thirty minutes is the maximum waiting time before leaving the placenta manually.
- Correct.

117
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:05,060
Thanks, Mom. I love you too, thanks.

118
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,240
Dr. Yoshimura helped me to be born.

119
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,309
Me, Yukiko, and is it going to help my child to be born.

120
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:32,069
He says that a birth is like the sunrise: we can not stop him even accelerate it. And I believe him.

121
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:41,196
It's clear to us that modernity upset everything. What we need turn the old way of life in Japan.

122
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:53,589
The protocol of hospitals dehumanizes birth, treat him like a disease.

123
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:57,919
But the woman is not a machine and the baby is not a product.

124
00:53:18,999 --> 00:53:24,749
- Do you feel it?
- Slowly.

125
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:41,550
Here she comes. Very good.

126
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,400
Ahh, yes ... Well done!

127
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,632
Hello!

128
00:54:01,282 --> 00:54:02,482
There.

129
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:37,992
My name is  Kokoya. I Oleseitoi's fifth wife. There are 10 women.

130
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,236
Nasieku midwife will help me to give birth our seventh child.

131
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,912
We  Masads.

132
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,834
Today I came to the temple ask that all goes well.

133
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:10,316
I almost died the last Since I gave birth Condo. Wonder if the gods are more favorable this time.

134
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:18,959
wizard reads the stones. He tells me he will go well and one boy announces today. It is the day that the Moon will hide the sun.

135
00:56:55,240 --> 00:57:02,960
Everyone thinks that Sandy is my stage name. It's not. It is my real name in real life and onstage.

136
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:08,673
I love dancing when I'm pregnant. My body is completely different. It's great to feel so.

137
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:47,149
We lost many cows because of drought. So Oleseitoi want it to be a girl.

138
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:53,879
Masads Among the men of the other villages provide cattle to the father to win the girl, and marry her later.

139
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:08,999
Inspire.

140
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:13,394
When it is  balarina,
nothing else matters.

141
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:19,630
Until the day I met Fred. With him, I felt like having a child.

142
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:30,192
There is a natural reflex to expel the baby. Which leads us to force quickly and efficiently.

143
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:35,555
But like most women take the epidural, we must teach them to push ...

144
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:42,095
In a way, is to force an artificial manner. Women do not do this way, when it is natural.

145
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:53,669
Most are children standing squatting or sitting. The position lying is mainly in European countries.

146
00:58:54,160 --> 00:59:00,318
- I will not ever get!
- Brace yourself, close your eyes and imagine the baby to slide out. Go ... continues ...

147
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:07,638
It's amazing I have to learn to give birth. Elsewhere, there are women they do not even think about it.

148
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:10,110
- So, how is it?
- It's hard.

149
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:40,150
- Do not move ...
- Yes, it is beginning to stir a little.

150
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:46,478
- Look, there he is ... so cute! Are you turning?
- Yes it is.

151
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:49,955
- Go, go!
- Let him turn around, look at your nose ...

152
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:07,393
It's so beautiful ...

153
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:15,677
- Has eyes like yours. Look. It seems ...
- No.

154
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,596
- It's beautiful.
- Yes, it's beautiful. As the father.

155
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:37,874
The Moon is closer. You mean my baby will be born.

156
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,837
The sky is changing.

157
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:29,360
My name is Elizabeth.
'm Siberian.

158
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:37,871
Outside 're 50 degrees Celsius, but that does not scare me. I live near the North Pole.

159
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,198
They took me by helicopter to the hospital Katanga.

160
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,078
I was with many contractions.

161
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,833
We do not have the right to give birth how our grandparents.

162
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:59,031
That's why I'm here alone ... and my husband got the dogs and reindeer on the ice.

163
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:05,995
We  Dolgans. The last nomads the north.

164
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,840
The doctor decided I do a cesarean.

165
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:15,037
My baby is too great ... I'm very worried.

166
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:36,796
A clinic of Dr. Yoshimura ... a traditional house was built. We live here as if lived 200 years ago.

167
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:44,429
Strive  body as before ... we have a healthy diet ... and give birth without medical intervention, like our ancestors.

168
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:16,955
They tell me I have a little girl, Ana. I wanted to have her beside me.

169
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:45,549
Everything is prepared for feel good ... serene ...

170
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:53,273
With the other mothers, live in harmony. We talked a lot.

171
01:10:55,560 --> 01:11:01,836
I tell them I was born here as my brother and my daughter Utano.

172
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:12,353
In fact, I think, somehow, Dr. Yoshimura as a grandfather.

173
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:19,988
In my family we say in jest we are supporters of "salmon Part R": We always come back to the same place terms for our children.

174
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:36,479
Oleseitoi has a hundred children. Each birth respected tradition: Spitting on the baby ...

175
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:44,312
Say it is ugly ... for luck ... poke a bull and take you a little blood and give me to drink; for me to regain strength.

176
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:52,755
Oleseitoi is very happy for being a girl. We called it Nemal'i, which brings prosperity.

177
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:41,916
- You had your child at home?
- Yes, on the couch.
- It must have been painful ...

178
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:46,714
Can you imagine?

179
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:09,191
Pilar wants to have her first child the dolphins. Trusts. You know you can have him alone.

180
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:18,511
I tell him that the great strength of women is knowing that our body ready for this.

181
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:29,791
The hypothesis of a cesarean you do not seem plausible, since her grandmother had 15 children without complications, and all born at home.

182
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:54,356
Tonight we will train. It not be forgotten that the birth can occur overnight.

183
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:06,789
Fernando  the attendant, chose two dolphins calm who love contact with people.

184
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:10,269
One is a female, Mouna, are waiting for a baby.

185
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:37,213
The dolphin uses its sonar. Ultrasound affect humans and the intrauterine life,

186
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:43,157
enhance our immune defenses and balancing the functioning the two hemispheres cererbrais.

187
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:51,108
That's why tonight, immediately after working with the dolphins the moms are gonna have wonderful dreams and they'll sleep a lot.

188
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:07,198
In my last show during pregnancy dance on a boat ...

189
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:55,519
To accustom the baby dolphin,
trained birth with a doll.

190
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:23,479
Utano will witness the birth the brother. Although has only three years, I think they'll remember for a lifetime.

191
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:30,914
It's funny ... You ask me if it's an egg it will come out of my belly. Father tells him no.

192
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:43,632
Utano is proud to have hosted the Yuit brother, and have cut the cord.

193
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:35,309
It seems that our son, Nino, decided to be born today. There are a total eclipse. It is very rare. He will at least have it on the day of his birth.

194
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:21,917
Let me go see my cat.

195
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:39,436
- Both traffic today!
- Good day ... No, no, I'm now into motherhood.
- Go off the phone.

196
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:42,358
Fred is a little nervous.

197
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:58,193
- It is the second red raisins ...
- Would he be born in the car?

198
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:17,629
- Over an hour of traffic jam. Aguentas or not?
- Sure ... I have pains, but I'm fine. Do not unnerve me, Fred.

199
01:24:32,881 --> 01:24:34,837
Maternity

200
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:42,313
- It's here, huh?
- We arrive.
- Come down here. I'll park the car.

201
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:27,510
- Okay, we'll be parents. Are you afraid?
- I'm fine.

202
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:44,278
It is a ritual  ours: each rose petal is a wish Sofia.

203
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:55,119
But for all babies who were born on this day only in which the Moon met with the Sun.

204
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:04,289
According to a Talmudic legend, when a baby is born, he still bears the ultimate knowledge of their ancestors.

205
01:31:04,289 --> 01:31:07,782
That's when an angel tells him to keep this knowledge secret.

206
01:31:07,782 --> 01:31:15,491
Put down a finger on his lips and at that moment the baby forgets everything to enter into life.

207
01:31:15,940 --> 01:31:22,895
A touch of the angel left a trace: the small groove between our upper lip and nose.

208
01:31:23,586 --> 01:31:31,676
Only this moment is that the baby may launch its first cry.

209
01:31:46,300 --> 01:32:06,300
Sin'ead O'Connor "A New Born Child"
-----
Just as two breaths become one breath,
As two whispers become a cry,
Miracle before us lies,
The glory of a new-born child.
These half-closed eyes already see,
Looking without looking within.
A testament of truth before, before our eyes.
The glory of a new-born child.
This place, where life's long path begins,
If they be princes, queens, or kings,
Laid helpless here at mother's side,
The glory of a new-born child.
