1
00:01:19,127 --> 00:01:20,896
Invitation.

2
00:01:23,632 --> 00:01:25,000
What's this?

3
00:01:25,066 --> 00:01:26,568
It's not an invitation.

4
00:01:26,602 --> 00:01:29,671
It's an arrest
warrant for your boss.

5
00:01:30,606 --> 00:01:31,606
Excuse me.

6
00:01:32,308 --> 00:01:33,909
Wrong invitation.

7
00:01:37,813 --> 00:01:39,624
Before you do
anything stupid...

8
00:01:39,648 --> 00:01:42,627
Like this?

9
00:01:42,651 --> 00:01:43,651
Yeah.

10
00:01:45,487 --> 00:01:46,298
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

11
00:01:46,322 --> 00:01:47,756
What's going on here?

12
00:01:54,496 --> 00:01:58,267
You come here and
interrupt my son's wedding.

13
00:02:00,168 --> 00:02:02,113
I've killed for less.

14
00:02:02,137 --> 00:02:03,137
I know.

15
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:06,518
You're a hard man
to find, Rasto.

16
00:02:06,542 --> 00:02:08,310
It's Mr. Boranovic.

17
00:02:08,344 --> 00:02:10,988
We just missed each other
three years ago in Berlin.

18
00:02:11,012 --> 00:02:15,760
You looked right at me in
Caracas in '09, remember that?

19
00:02:15,784 --> 00:02:17,319
Doesn't matter now.

20
00:02:18,687 --> 00:02:20,498
You're the Interpol man.

21
00:02:20,522 --> 00:02:22,558
MI6, actually, but yes.

22
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,496
You have no authority
to arrest me here.

23
00:02:27,529 --> 00:02:29,674
You're right, I don't.

24
00:02:29,698 --> 00:02:33,535
But they do.

25
00:02:47,048 --> 00:02:49,527
In my country, I'm a hero.

26
00:02:49,551 --> 00:02:51,720
They will not extradite me.

27
00:02:52,721 --> 00:02:54,856
They already have.

28
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,200
20 minutes from now,
you'll be on a plane

29
00:02:56,224 --> 00:02:57,926
heading to The Hague.

30
00:03:00,362 --> 00:03:01,506
You really want a bloodbath

31
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,842
at your son's wedding,
Mr. Boranovic?

32
00:03:04,866 --> 00:03:06,535
Get him out of here.

33
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:12,049
I'll be home in a week.

34
00:03:12,073 --> 00:03:13,842
- One week!
- We'll see.

35
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:10,942
Hey, man.

36
00:04:10,966 --> 00:04:12,233
Jesus, Jake,

37
00:04:12,267 --> 00:04:13,144
- what are you doin'?
- Dad, I, I'm sorry.

38
00:04:13,168 --> 00:04:14,145
I forgot, okay, I was out...

39
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:15,447
Jake, you were
supposed to take

40
00:04:15,471 --> 00:04:17,406
your medicine four
hours ago, man.

41
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:18,607
I know, I'm sorry.

42
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,784
I just forgot.

43
00:04:19,808 --> 00:04:23,120
Stop apologizing to me, okay?

44
00:04:23,144 --> 00:04:24,145
It's not about me.

45
00:04:24,179 --> 00:04:24,989
It never has been.

46
00:04:25,013 --> 00:04:27,015
We've been through this.

47
00:04:30,486 --> 00:04:34,599
Okay, just, just listen
to me for a second.

48
00:04:34,623 --> 00:04:35,767
Understand this,
you can do whatever

49
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,268
you want in this life, okay?

50
00:04:37,292 --> 00:04:38,970
Whatever it is you want, but
the one thing that you can

51
00:04:38,994 --> 00:04:42,931
never, ever do is forget
to take your medicine.

52
00:04:43,999 --> 00:04:44,842
You with me?

53
00:04:44,866 --> 00:04:45,934
Yeah, okay.

54
00:04:47,836 --> 00:04:49,004
- Okay.
- Yeah.

55
00:04:50,271 --> 00:04:51,816
I'm sorry, man, I just...

56
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,841
I, I'm sorry.

57
00:04:52,874 --> 00:04:53,809
I just forgot, Dad.

58
00:04:53,842 --> 00:04:56,320
It's okay.

59
00:04:56,344 --> 00:04:57,344
It's okay.

60
00:04:58,614 --> 00:04:59,781
You hungry?

61
00:04:59,815 --> 00:05:00,992
You want something
to eat, maybe?

62
00:05:01,016 --> 00:05:03,127
Uh, I was actually
gonna go shoot

63
00:05:03,151 --> 00:05:04,996
the bow for a little bit.

64
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:09,124
If you want, come out
and shoot it with me?

65
00:05:09,157 --> 00:05:10,334
Sounds good.

66
00:05:10,358 --> 00:05:13,795
I'll join you out there
in a little bit, okay?

67
00:05:44,192 --> 00:05:45,659
Hey.

68
00:05:46,762 --> 00:05:48,263
Hey!

69
00:05:52,233 --> 00:05:54,568
How many times I tell
you not to sit in my chair?

70
00:06:13,421 --> 00:06:15,141
You know, the bathroom
floor needs cleanin'.

71
00:06:21,196 --> 00:06:22,196
Damn kid.

72
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,767
Hey, baby, it's me.

73
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,927
Oh, my God,
I've been so worried.

74
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,070
How did it go?

75
00:06:53,094 --> 00:06:53,971
Everything went fine.

76
00:06:53,995 --> 00:06:55,230
You know how they are.

77
00:06:55,263 --> 00:06:56,140
They like to kick
and scream more than

78
00:06:56,164 --> 00:06:57,666
they actually like to fight.

79
00:06:57,733 --> 00:07:00,211
Nolan, this guy's
not your normal suspect.

80
00:07:00,235 --> 00:07:01,402
You said, what?

81
00:07:01,436 --> 00:07:03,715
He's already killed
three witnesses?

82
00:07:03,739 --> 00:07:05,116
You don't need to
worry about that.

83
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,284
Of course I'm
gonna worry about it.

84
00:07:07,308 --> 00:07:09,511
Well, we got a great case
and good news is we finally

85
00:07:09,578 --> 00:07:10,454
have him in custody.

86
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:12,447
He's landed four hours ago.

87
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,994
Oh, great, we
can't wait to see you.

88
00:07:17,018 --> 00:07:19,296
Nolan?

89
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,657
- Nolan?
- Look, honey I'm so sorry.

90
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,167
There's nothing I
can do about this,

91
00:07:23,191 --> 00:07:25,336
but I have to fly to the
States before I come home.

92
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,863
You've been gone a
month trying to find this guy.

93
00:07:27,929 --> 00:07:29,097
I know.

94
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,307
One more piece of evidence.

95
00:07:30,331 --> 00:07:31,809
Gotta get it tied up
before Boranovic sees

96
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,273
the judge Monday
morning, that's all.

97
00:07:33,301 --> 00:07:34,646
You told Shelly
you'd be home already.

98
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,038
And I thought I would be.

99
00:07:37,105 --> 00:07:38,850
Look, I'll call her
after school, okay?

100
00:07:38,874 --> 00:07:40,184
Baby, 20 years.

101
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,442
You've done your part.

102
00:07:41,476 --> 00:07:42,654
Someone else can
take it from here.

103
00:07:42,678 --> 00:07:44,379
Emma, we've already
spoken about this.

104
00:07:44,445 --> 00:07:46,345
Nolan.

105
00:07:47,683 --> 00:07:49,994
It's just the things
I've seen this man do.

106
00:07:50,018 --> 00:07:52,363
I know, I know.

107
00:07:52,387 --> 00:07:54,956
No, you don't, baby.

108
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:58,870
No, you don't, you haven't
seen the things I've seen.

109
00:07:58,894 --> 00:08:01,162
And I'm not about to let our
daughter grow up in world

110
00:08:01,196 --> 00:08:02,640
where men like this walk free.

111
00:08:02,664 --> 00:08:04,964
Certainly not while I can
do something about it.

112
00:08:05,867 --> 00:08:07,903
Do what you gotta do.

113
00:08:07,969 --> 00:08:10,114
We miss you is all.

114
00:08:10,138 --> 00:08:11,783
I miss you, too.

115
00:08:11,807 --> 00:08:14,175
I'll be home in
a couple of days.

116
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:15,376
Yeah.

117
00:08:16,645 --> 00:08:18,690
Now, please try
not to worry, okay?

118
00:08:18,714 --> 00:08:21,525
Dangerous part's over now.

119
00:08:21,549 --> 00:08:23,652
I love you.

120
00:08:23,685 --> 00:08:24,685
You too.

121
00:09:13,068 --> 00:09:15,713
I go to court in one
week, and as we speak,

122
00:09:15,737 --> 00:09:19,741
there's an agent en route
collecting evidence.

123
00:09:19,775 --> 00:09:20,775
Hello?

124
00:09:22,143 --> 00:09:26,147
Yes, get it done in a week,
and I'll pay you double.

125
00:09:26,214 --> 00:09:29,284
And if you don't,
you'll get nothing.

126
00:09:31,286 --> 00:09:33,364
Yes, completely dissolved.

127
00:09:33,388 --> 00:09:35,724
No body, no blood, no trace.

128
00:09:36,892 --> 00:09:38,491
Like they never existed.

129
00:09:40,595 --> 00:09:42,597
Okay, so
what do you say?

130
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,540
40, 50?

131
00:09:43,564 --> 00:09:44,541
Like, all right, 50.

132
00:09:44,565 --> 00:09:45,777
- Yeah.
- Copy.

133
00:09:45,801 --> 00:09:46,878
- Yeah, I like that.
- Okay, it's a lock.

134
00:09:46,902 --> 00:09:48,236
- Hey, Jake.
- Hey.

135
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,715
Uh, check this out.

136
00:09:50,739 --> 00:09:52,607
New arrowheads.

137
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,118
Just became regulation.

138
00:09:54,142 --> 00:09:56,954
Where'd you get these?

139
00:09:56,978 --> 00:09:58,680
Wait a minute, is
this the charge

140
00:09:58,747 --> 00:09:59,991
that went on my credit card?

141
00:10:00,015 --> 00:10:02,493
I, I, I didn't
think you'd mind.

142
00:10:02,517 --> 00:10:04,185
Oh, come on, Jake.

143
00:10:04,252 --> 00:10:05,396
What're you thinkin', man?

144
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,955
Dad, they increased
lethality, okay?

145
00:10:06,988 --> 00:10:07,932
So you don't have to go chasing

146
00:10:07,956 --> 00:10:10,625
a blood trail through the woods.

147
00:10:12,994 --> 00:10:14,471
Does it change the flight?

148
00:10:14,495 --> 00:10:16,473
Website says no.

149
00:10:16,497 --> 00:10:17,742
Well, it doesn't matter, okay?

150
00:10:17,766 --> 00:10:19,076
You still should
have come to me.

151
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,812
It's a little irresponsible,
don't you think?

152
00:10:20,836 --> 00:10:22,003
He asked me first.

153
00:10:22,037 --> 00:10:22,971
Oh, did he?

154
00:10:23,004 --> 00:10:24,348
I told him it was okay.

155
00:10:24,372 --> 00:10:27,542
My credit card's
maxed out this month.

156
00:10:28,977 --> 00:10:31,455
Okay, fine, but you still
should have come to me.

157
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:32,814
- I mean...
- Dad.

158
00:10:32,848 --> 00:10:34,491
Hey, it's a little excessive,
don't you think, guys?

159
00:10:34,515 --> 00:10:36,017
- Come on.
- He knows what he's doing.

160
00:10:36,051 --> 00:10:39,320
I, I just wanted it to be a
surprise for our trip, okay?

161
00:10:39,354 --> 00:10:40,765
Oh, it's a surprise all right.

162
00:10:40,789 --> 00:10:43,825
Hey, let him do something
nice for his father.

163
00:10:43,859 --> 00:10:45,636
He can work off the
money later, right?

164
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,272
Yes, I'll work it off.

165
00:10:48,296 --> 00:10:50,298
Frank, just relax.

166
00:10:50,331 --> 00:10:51,833
- We're on vacation.
- Okay.

167
00:10:51,867 --> 00:10:53,044
This is the summer house.

168
00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:54,803
You live for the
summer house, right?

169
00:10:54,836 --> 00:10:56,280
- Yes.
- Just relax.

170
00:10:56,304 --> 00:10:58,682
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

171
00:10:58,706 --> 00:11:00,241
Okay, it's fine.

172
00:11:00,308 --> 00:11:01,218
We'll use it.

173
00:11:01,242 --> 00:11:02,219
It's no problem, we'll use it.

174
00:11:02,243 --> 00:11:04,645
But just talk to me next time.

175
00:11:06,147 --> 00:11:07,482
Just talk to me.

176
00:11:10,085 --> 00:11:11,062
I'm gonna get my guard.

177
00:11:11,086 --> 00:11:12,086
Okay.

178
00:11:13,521 --> 00:11:16,524
Mm, because that's
so easy, right?

179
00:11:17,893 --> 00:11:18,893
Listen.

180
00:11:22,063 --> 00:11:23,507
He loves you.

181
00:11:23,531 --> 00:11:25,400
- You know that.
- I know.

182
00:11:26,601 --> 00:11:30,247
He's just been on high
alert since you arrived.

183
00:11:30,271 --> 00:11:31,415
It's all he knows how to do.

184
00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:32,874
He can't help it.

185
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:37,989
Thanks for covering for me.

186
00:11:38,013 --> 00:11:40,057
You really should
have asked first.

187
00:11:40,081 --> 00:11:41,081
I know.

188
00:11:42,918 --> 00:11:44,385
Let me see that.

189
00:11:46,922 --> 00:11:48,165
It's pretty cool.

190
00:11:48,189 --> 00:11:49,429
Yeah, it's
pretty badass, right?

191
00:12:16,818 --> 00:12:18,486
Hey, Daddy, watch me.

192
00:12:50,318 --> 00:12:51,628
It's okay, it's not bad.

193
00:12:51,652 --> 00:12:52,463
Try again.

194
00:12:52,487 --> 00:12:53,664
Compensate for the wind.

195
00:12:53,688 --> 00:12:55,790
Reference the trees,
it helps a lot.

196
00:12:55,823 --> 00:12:57,334
Listen, I'm thinking
your kill shot's

197
00:12:57,358 --> 00:13:00,004
still around 40 yards, but I
wanna know how you're gonna

198
00:13:00,028 --> 00:13:02,097
do with a still shot, okay?

199
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:05,800
How can you do holding
and waiting for the prey

200
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,444
to show its perfect face, okay?

201
00:13:07,468 --> 00:13:09,813
- Okay.
- Try it, let's see it.

202
00:13:09,837 --> 00:13:11,439
I want you to hold.

203
00:13:17,012 --> 00:13:18,012
Okay, hold.

204
00:13:25,153 --> 00:13:26,319
Release.

205
00:13:28,689 --> 00:13:29,600
Not bad at all.

206
00:13:29,624 --> 00:13:31,035
Not bad at all, Jake.

207
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:32,961
Give me a look at that?

208
00:13:51,546 --> 00:13:52,547
Still got a long way

209
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,848
to catch the old man.

210
00:13:53,881 --> 00:13:55,126
Keep at it, you're looking good.

211
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,318
- Yeah.
- Okay, keep at it.

212
00:13:59,487 --> 00:14:02,390
Fuck!

213
00:14:39,727 --> 00:14:41,527
Excuse me, you know
where I can find...

214
00:17:10,845 --> 00:17:12,889
No, no, just the bags.

215
00:17:12,913 --> 00:17:14,515
What do you mean?

216
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:17,194
This year we're
goin' full survival.

217
00:17:17,218 --> 00:17:19,554
Gonna eat what we catch.

218
00:17:19,587 --> 00:17:21,665
We're gonna cook it on a spit,

219
00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:25,023
gonna hang the meat up overnight
so the bears don't eat it.

220
00:17:26,261 --> 00:17:27,771
We're gonna boil
the water we find.

221
00:17:27,795 --> 00:17:29,797
We're goin' old school, pal.

222
00:17:29,864 --> 00:17:31,232
Except sleep in a bag.

223
00:17:31,266 --> 00:17:32,709
That's right, Jake.

224
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:34,077
It does get a little cold
out there, doesn't it?

225
00:17:34,101 --> 00:17:35,101
Drop that.

226
00:17:37,405 --> 00:17:38,406
Cool.

227
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:39,540
Yeah, cool.

228
00:17:40,641 --> 00:17:42,085
Okay.

229
00:17:42,109 --> 00:17:43,387
Get rid of that, lock
this up, we gotta pick up

230
00:17:43,411 --> 00:17:45,079
the ATVs on the way.

231
00:17:46,547 --> 00:17:47,547
Okay.

232
00:17:49,617 --> 00:17:52,119
- Hey.
- Hey, almost ready?

233
00:17:52,153 --> 00:17:55,432
Yeah, we're good.

234
00:17:55,456 --> 00:17:57,558
Have so much fun.

235
00:17:57,592 --> 00:17:58,535
Be safe.

236
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,103
Bring me something awesome.

237
00:18:00,127 --> 00:18:02,630
Take care of my baby.

238
00:18:02,663 --> 00:18:05,331
- I love you.
- I love you.

239
00:18:11,406 --> 00:18:12,316
- So long.
- Okay.

240
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,074
- See you.
- Okay, bye.

241
00:18:14,975 --> 00:18:16,787
You, have fun.

242
00:18:16,811 --> 00:18:18,012
- I will.
- Be safe.

243
00:18:18,078 --> 00:18:19,078
Okay.

244
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,915
Take care of each other.

245
00:18:20,948 --> 00:18:21,825
I'll take care of myself.

246
00:18:21,849 --> 00:18:23,951
Be good.

247
00:18:23,984 --> 00:18:26,463
All right.

248
00:18:26,487 --> 00:18:27,898
Don't have too much fun
here without us, though.

249
00:18:27,922 --> 00:18:28,923
All right.

250
00:18:40,668 --> 00:18:42,435
Do you like it, Daddy?

251
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,098
He didn't even finish
dumpin' the trash.

252
00:20:51,131 --> 00:20:52,376
He didn't lock up.

253
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,268
He didn't call, nothin'.

254
00:20:54,301 --> 00:20:56,270
It was like he vanished.

255
00:20:57,472 --> 00:21:00,007
Think Boranovic
tracked him down?

256
00:21:00,074 --> 00:21:01,552
Look, I think we
have a problem here.

257
00:21:01,576 --> 00:21:03,277
First kid has disappeared.

258
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,455
That tracks.

259
00:21:04,479 --> 00:21:06,347
Interpol got a call from
the adoption agency.

260
00:21:06,414 --> 00:21:08,392
They've uncovered a hack.

261
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,326
When?

262
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,284
A few days ago.

263
00:21:10,317 --> 00:21:12,062
Forensics tracked the activity.

264
00:21:12,086 --> 00:21:13,630
They only took one file.

265
00:21:13,654 --> 00:21:15,423
The John Doe on
the Boranovic boys.

266
00:21:15,456 --> 00:21:17,067
Well, how did they
even know where to look?

267
00:21:17,091 --> 00:21:18,292
No idea.

268
00:21:18,325 --> 00:21:19,770
But they're not
new to cybercrime.

269
00:21:19,794 --> 00:21:22,238
If it was them, Rasto knows
everything now including

270
00:21:22,262 --> 00:21:25,976
the names and location
of both offspring.

271
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,468
Got it.

272
00:21:27,502 --> 00:21:29,312
Look, we're done here.

273
00:21:29,336 --> 00:21:30,514
We have an open
case, I mean shouldn't we...

274
00:21:30,538 --> 00:21:32,039
Look, Rasto is
extremely selective.

275
00:21:32,106 --> 00:21:34,308
He's used the same
worker for years.

276
00:21:34,341 --> 00:21:35,752
He's a ghost.

277
00:21:35,776 --> 00:21:38,321
If this isn't him,
locals can handle it.

278
00:21:38,345 --> 00:21:41,716
But if it is, then
the boy's long gone.

279
00:21:41,782 --> 00:21:43,660
Nothing more we can do here.

280
00:21:43,684 --> 00:21:45,620
We need to go find Jake Kimber.

281
00:22:56,056 --> 00:22:57,424
Can I help?

282
00:22:58,526 --> 00:23:00,060
Oh, oh, I'm good.

283
00:23:07,301 --> 00:23:08,301
Really?

284
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:12,406
Um, no, I'm good.

285
00:23:12,439 --> 00:23:13,439
Thank you.

286
00:23:15,109 --> 00:23:16,310
I don't mind.

287
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,080
I got it.

288
00:23:24,785 --> 00:23:29,566
I'm tryin' to find my way
back to the, uh, the highway.

289
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:32,736
Just go back the
way that you came.

290
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,461
What kind of logger
gets lost in the woods?

291
00:23:47,808 --> 00:23:49,975
Guess I just
got turned around.

292
00:23:52,012 --> 00:23:54,515
Look at me.

293
00:23:54,582 --> 00:23:55,582
Look at me.

294
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:58,418
I don't have to hurt you.

295
00:24:06,326 --> 00:24:07,326
Down.

296
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:11,798
Down.

297
00:24:56,376 --> 00:24:57,645
Damn it.

298
00:26:37,477 --> 00:26:39,656
At the cabin this
week for the annual

299
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,324
hunting trip with my dad.

300
00:26:41,348 --> 00:26:43,326
I'm gonna link the map
down in the description

301
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,828
so you guys can check it out.

302
00:26:44,852 --> 00:26:48,455
And I got a new bow, which
I'm hoping to christen with

303
00:26:48,488 --> 00:26:50,801
a beautiful 12 point.

304
00:26:50,825 --> 00:26:55,495
And it's not rifle season,
so me and my dad are gonna be

305
00:26:55,529 --> 00:26:56,973
the only ones out there.

306
00:26:56,997 --> 00:26:59,133
It's gonna be pretty amazing.

307
00:27:03,337 --> 00:27:04,981
Seems like we should've
brought horses instead.

308
00:27:05,005 --> 00:27:06,638
Well, I didn't
wanna overwhelm you.

309
00:27:07,808 --> 00:27:09,686
Wouldn't bother me.

310
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:12,379
I'd hunt horseback,
Indian style.

311
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,450
Yeah, well, before
the Spanish came,

312
00:27:16,483 --> 00:27:18,762
the Natives did hunt on foot.

313
00:27:18,786 --> 00:27:20,430
So, we already are, then?

314
00:27:20,454 --> 00:27:21,655
One of us is.

315
00:27:21,688 --> 00:27:24,267
They didn't have little
wheels on their bows.

316
00:27:24,291 --> 00:27:25,325
Okay, okay.

317
00:27:26,794 --> 00:27:28,796
Okay, man, listen up.

318
00:27:28,829 --> 00:27:30,006
I don't think this path takes us

319
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,732
all the way down to
the valley floor.

320
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:34,301
So, we'll take this one till
it ends, dump the quads,

321
00:27:34,334 --> 00:27:35,345
and continue on foot.

322
00:27:35,369 --> 00:27:37,680
- Sound good to you?
- Yep.

323
00:27:37,704 --> 00:27:39,840
- We locked?
- Yeah.

324
00:27:39,874 --> 00:27:41,117
You have the key?

325
00:27:41,141 --> 00:27:42,176
- Yep.
- Cool.

326
00:27:44,211 --> 00:27:45,243
Sweet.

327
00:28:00,494 --> 00:28:02,329
Here comes the cops.

328
00:28:10,905 --> 00:28:14,417
June, we are 10-eight
at the Kimber property.

329
00:28:14,441 --> 00:28:17,945
And be advised, our federal
friends are already on scene.

330
00:28:18,012 --> 00:28:20,180
Don't let 'em
push you around, Sheriff.

331
00:28:20,214 --> 00:28:21,391
But be nice.

332
00:28:21,415 --> 00:28:22,917
I'm always nice.

333
00:28:24,451 --> 00:28:25,451
That woman.

334
00:28:33,127 --> 00:28:34,127
Gentlemen.

335
00:28:41,435 --> 00:28:43,213
They're weekenders.

336
00:28:43,237 --> 00:28:46,240
A couple o' weeks during
the summers, mostly.

337
00:28:46,273 --> 00:28:48,919
They're fine enough
people, yeah.

338
00:28:48,943 --> 00:28:50,120
Truck's gone.

339
00:28:50,144 --> 00:28:52,146
But Frank and his son
plan a big hunting trip

340
00:28:52,212 --> 00:28:55,215
every year about this time, so.

341
00:28:55,249 --> 00:28:56,059
And what about the car?

342
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:58,085
That belong to the wife?

343
00:28:59,954 --> 00:29:01,431
Yeah.

344
00:29:01,455 --> 00:29:03,958
Maybe she's out with
friends, who knows?

345
00:29:03,991 --> 00:29:05,268
Well, maybe you
can help us find her?

346
00:29:05,292 --> 00:29:06,825
We thank you for
your assistance.

347
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,568
Yeah, well, when the FBI
tells you to do somethin',

348
00:29:14,601 --> 00:29:16,168
I guess you do it, huh?

349
00:29:17,671 --> 00:29:20,908
Hell, even if they are foreign.

350
00:29:20,941 --> 00:29:21,818
You think you might be able

351
00:29:21,842 --> 00:29:24,411
to help us get inside, Sheriff?

352
00:29:27,581 --> 00:29:30,584
Why, hell, I
don't know how y'all

353
00:29:30,617 --> 00:29:32,495
do it in Her Majesty's domain.

354
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:33,921
Over here, on this
side of the pond,

355
00:29:33,954 --> 00:29:35,665
ownership's 9/10ths of the law.

356
00:29:35,689 --> 00:29:37,100
We cannot barge into
the house without

357
00:29:37,124 --> 00:29:38,969
a duly executed warrant
and you know that.

358
00:29:38,993 --> 00:29:40,194
When lives are in danger...

359
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,906
I believe that's
reasonable grounds.

360
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:44,074
No matter where you are.

361
00:29:44,098 --> 00:29:45,132
- Yeah.
- Sir.

362
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,034
Yeah, yeah.

363
00:29:49,303 --> 00:29:53,016
Now tell me, what reason
might that be, son?

364
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,309
That's
on a need-to-know.

365
00:29:55,342 --> 00:29:56,452
It's my county.

366
00:29:56,476 --> 00:29:57,711
Jesus Christ.

367
00:29:58,879 --> 00:30:01,824
Gray, you hear
what I just said?

368
00:30:01,848 --> 00:30:03,659
- I did.
- Oh, hell.

369
00:30:03,683 --> 00:30:05,185
Doctrine of
Plainview, Sheriff.

370
00:30:05,219 --> 00:30:06,162
We are within our rights.

371
00:30:06,186 --> 00:30:07,621
Aw, hell.

372
00:30:07,654 --> 00:30:09,599
Hey, asshole, when my
father's talkin', you listen!

373
00:30:09,623 --> 00:30:11,291
Take it easy, boy.

374
00:30:15,195 --> 00:30:16,940
Oh, Christ almighty.

375
00:30:16,964 --> 00:30:18,532
Don't say a word.

376
00:31:42,482 --> 00:31:43,482
Oh, yeah.

377
00:31:44,951 --> 00:31:45,951
No, yeah.

378
00:31:47,054 --> 00:31:48,198
No, boy.

379
00:31:48,222 --> 00:31:49,889
What the hell you doin', huh?

380
00:31:49,923 --> 00:31:51,934
- I told you to stay with me.
- Gray.

381
00:31:51,958 --> 00:31:53,427
You'll screw
up this crime scene.

382
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,538
By the time they're done
here, that kid'll be long dead.

383
00:31:55,562 --> 00:31:57,107
Bureau forensics will
be here in an hour.

384
00:31:57,131 --> 00:31:58,574
For 20 years.

385
00:31:58,598 --> 00:31:59,609
I'll be damned if my office
is gonna mess this up.

386
00:31:59,633 --> 00:32:00,876
Okay, good.

387
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,811
Look, keep an eye on
these guys, will you?

388
00:32:01,835 --> 00:32:03,770
I'm gonna take a look around.

389
00:33:20,547 --> 00:33:22,892
Jake Kimber had a
Facebook page deleted today

390
00:33:22,916 --> 00:33:24,918
after he and his father
left to go hunting.

391
00:33:24,984 --> 00:33:26,353
Hey and one more thing.

392
00:33:26,386 --> 00:33:27,730
The kid's a hemophiliac.

393
00:33:27,754 --> 00:33:29,031
Well, that
doesn't make this any easier.

394
00:33:29,055 --> 00:33:30,224
No, Sheriff?

395
00:33:31,991 --> 00:33:32,991
Mr. Gray.

396
00:33:34,661 --> 00:33:37,197
I am going to apologize to you.

397
00:33:37,231 --> 00:33:39,175
I didn't take your word.

398
00:33:39,199 --> 00:33:40,476
No harm done, Sheriff.

399
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,545
We're on the same team, anyway.

400
00:33:42,569 --> 00:33:44,771
Besides, I think this guy,
he's been one step ahead

401
00:33:44,838 --> 00:33:46,173
of all of us, anyway.

402
00:33:46,206 --> 00:33:50,353
Yeah, well, I decided
to call the pro shop.

403
00:33:50,377 --> 00:33:52,822
Frank, he took out
an archery permit.

404
00:33:52,846 --> 00:33:56,248
He didn't list
where he was goin'.

405
00:33:57,717 --> 00:34:01,030
You think they're still alive?

406
00:34:01,054 --> 00:34:02,889
Truthfully, I don't know.

407
00:34:02,922 --> 00:34:04,090
But I hope so.

408
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,694
I've been
waitin' a long time

409
00:34:31,718 --> 00:34:33,887
to come back up here, Jake.

410
00:34:36,122 --> 00:34:39,259
I mean, this is,
this is awesome.

411
00:34:39,293 --> 00:34:40,293
Yeah.

412
00:34:41,928 --> 00:34:43,663
Wow, I mean.

413
00:34:45,765 --> 00:34:49,279
Hey, that looks like a good
spot for base camp, yeah?

414
00:34:49,303 --> 00:34:50,937
Yeah.

415
00:35:04,818 --> 00:35:06,128
- You bedding there?
- Yeah.

416
00:35:06,152 --> 00:35:07,521
- Okay.
- Looks soft.

417
00:35:07,587 --> 00:35:09,423
I'll park it here,
we got our fire.

418
00:35:09,456 --> 00:35:10,456
Good.

419
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:17,130
I mean, this thing's
gonna come in so handy.

420
00:35:17,163 --> 00:35:19,008
Glad you picked
that thing up, right?

421
00:35:19,032 --> 00:35:24,037
I remember how excited you
were when we bought that.

422
00:35:26,172 --> 00:35:28,675
Get the rocks and don't tell Ma.

423
00:35:28,708 --> 00:35:30,377
Okay.

424
00:35:30,444 --> 00:35:32,322
No one really seems
to listen, though.

425
00:35:32,346 --> 00:35:35,114
Oh, God, gorgeous, isn't it?

426
00:36:45,084 --> 00:36:46,252
Come on,
what're you doin'?

427
00:36:46,286 --> 00:36:47,397
You think you're
in college already?

428
00:36:47,421 --> 00:36:48,421
Let's move.

429
00:36:50,089 --> 00:36:52,502
Your snoring
kept me up all night.

430
00:36:52,526 --> 00:36:54,025
That was the plan.

431
00:36:57,196 --> 00:36:59,699
So, today we're gonna
lighten up the load,

432
00:36:59,733 --> 00:37:02,402
just take one backpack.

433
00:37:02,436 --> 00:37:03,346
You good?

434
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:05,372
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

435
00:37:08,575 --> 00:37:09,643
Oh, last one.

436
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,422
We better bag a buck,

437
00:37:12,446 --> 00:37:15,615
or we'll be eatin'
dandelions all day.

438
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,452
- Do me a favor?
- Mm hm?

439
00:37:18,485 --> 00:37:19,295
Put the ammo in yours?

440
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:20,818
Good.

441
00:37:23,289 --> 00:37:24,600
Oh, no, no.

442
00:37:24,624 --> 00:37:25,792
Allow me.

443
00:37:25,825 --> 00:37:27,585
I'd feel bad if I didn't
shoulder the burden.

444
00:37:28,562 --> 00:37:30,096
And I'd feel
bad if you didn't.

445
00:37:36,102 --> 00:37:37,837
Hey, you hear that?

446
00:37:39,138 --> 00:37:40,138
What?

447
00:37:42,642 --> 00:37:45,412
It sounds like another engine.

448
00:37:51,317 --> 00:37:53,496
Well, it's not rifle season,

449
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,489
and a little too far out for
someone to be takin' a joyride.

450
00:37:59,659 --> 00:38:02,137
Let's orange up just in case.

451
00:38:02,161 --> 00:38:03,161
All right.

452
00:38:35,462 --> 00:38:40,376
And it's not rifle season,
so me and my dad are gonna be

453
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,378
the only ones out there.

454
00:38:42,402 --> 00:38:45,515
It's gonna be pretty amazing.

455
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:47,741
So, Sheriff, I'm
assuming a helicopter won't

456
00:38:47,807 --> 00:38:49,008
be a problem for you.

457
00:38:49,042 --> 00:38:50,319
Search and rescue
get us up there?

458
00:38:50,343 --> 00:38:52,021
Oh, Christ.

459
00:38:52,045 --> 00:38:54,681
My only chopper's on loan,
fightin' them damn fires in Utah.

460
00:38:54,714 --> 00:38:55,625
What are my options?

461
00:38:55,649 --> 00:38:57,292
I camped up there before.

462
00:38:57,316 --> 00:38:59,819
We're gonna need ATVs, four
by fours and whatever...

463
00:38:59,853 --> 00:39:01,531
Yeah, how long
to get up there?

464
00:39:01,555 --> 00:39:03,032
Two hours.

465
00:39:03,056 --> 00:39:04,323
Fuck.

466
00:39:04,357 --> 00:39:05,535
Well, I'm sorry to
rain on your parade,

467
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:07,036
but I just think we

468
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:07,861
- can't just go up there...
- This isn't about rain on

469
00:39:07,894 --> 00:39:09,138
a fucking parade, kid.

470
00:39:09,162 --> 00:39:10,906
This is about saving
lives, you hear me?

471
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:12,666
Frank and Jake Kimber.

472
00:39:12,699 --> 00:39:14,043
We don't find them by nightfall,

473
00:39:14,067 --> 00:39:16,035
I can guarantee you
they'll be dead and buried.

474
00:39:16,069 --> 00:39:19,549
Who's this fella who's
huntin' 'em, anyway?

475
00:39:19,573 --> 00:39:20,940
He's a monster.

476
00:39:24,177 --> 00:39:27,013
Son, you wanna
give us a minute?

477
00:39:35,421 --> 00:39:38,091
He can get you to the trailhead.

478
00:39:39,759 --> 00:39:41,170
Look, I know he's
green behind the ears.

479
00:39:41,194 --> 00:39:42,404
Yeah, and that's exactly
why he's not coming.

480
00:39:42,428 --> 00:39:44,130
He knows this valley
as good as anyone.

481
00:39:44,197 --> 00:39:47,534
He can put you right
down on top of 'em.

482
00:39:49,102 --> 00:39:52,939
Look, he is my son, and
I think he needs this.

483
00:39:57,043 --> 00:39:58,353
He stands in my
way for one second,

484
00:39:58,377 --> 00:40:00,523
I'll leave him where he stands.

485
00:40:00,547 --> 00:40:02,248
I can respect that.

486
00:40:03,282 --> 00:40:04,751
All right, I'm gonna stay here.

487
00:40:04,784 --> 00:40:06,529
I'm gonna try and rustle
up some eyes in the sky,

488
00:40:06,553 --> 00:40:08,097
get some resources together.

489
00:40:08,121 --> 00:40:10,657
I'm gonna see you in the valley.

490
00:40:10,724 --> 00:40:11,758
Thank you.

491
00:40:11,791 --> 00:40:12,791
Gray?

492
00:40:16,129 --> 00:40:17,764
You take care of my boy, huh?

493
00:42:43,943 --> 00:42:45,912
That's Frank Kimber's truck.

494
00:42:45,945 --> 00:42:48,423
You know who
this one belongs to?

495
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:50,216
I don't know that one.

496
00:42:50,249 --> 00:42:52,361
You wanna run a
plate check on it?

497
00:42:52,385 --> 00:42:55,488
Yeah, it
won't take a minute.

498
00:43:03,562 --> 00:43:05,899
Gray, take a look at this.

499
00:43:17,777 --> 00:43:19,154
Hey, look.

500
00:43:19,178 --> 00:43:20,178
Tracks.

501
00:43:29,322 --> 00:43:30,990
They had three sets.

502
00:43:31,958 --> 00:43:34,169
Run a search for a stolen ATV?

503
00:43:34,193 --> 00:43:35,838
That we could do.

504
00:43:35,862 --> 00:43:38,464
It's just gonna tell us
who he killed to get it.

505
00:43:43,002 --> 00:43:44,847
There's nothin'
on the truck itself.

506
00:43:44,871 --> 00:43:46,248
But the registered
owner's wife filed

507
00:43:46,272 --> 00:43:48,650
a missing person two days ago.

508
00:43:48,674 --> 00:43:51,878
And apparently
ain't found him yet.

509
00:43:51,945 --> 00:43:54,280
They're not going to.

510
00:43:54,313 --> 00:43:56,358
Deputy, you know this
area pretty well, huh?

511
00:43:56,382 --> 00:43:57,526
Yeah.

512
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:58,928
There's a steep
climb into the valley

513
00:43:58,952 --> 00:44:01,831
and that's the only trail in.

514
00:44:01,855 --> 00:44:05,825
But we could hike around
the ridge and flank 'em.

515
00:44:08,161 --> 00:44:10,305
It's a good idea.

516
00:44:10,329 --> 00:44:12,507
So, what's the visual on
the valley from up there?

517
00:44:12,531 --> 00:44:14,734
Well, I brought my drone.

518
00:44:25,711 --> 00:44:28,858
I'm kind of a hobbyist, but, uh,

519
00:44:28,882 --> 00:44:31,717
I think I could probably go pro.

520
00:44:48,902 --> 00:44:51,546
Looks like he
trashed their ATVs.

521
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:54,073
Good news, it means
he's still here.

522
00:44:54,107 --> 00:44:55,842
Mean's he hasn't killed 'em yet.

523
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:56,752
Why would they leave the quads

524
00:44:56,776 --> 00:44:58,211
so far from the valley floor?

525
00:44:58,244 --> 00:45:00,823
There's no trails down there,
and it's just too rugged.

526
00:45:00,847 --> 00:45:03,759
Plus, the engines
scare off the prey.

527
00:45:03,783 --> 00:45:05,060
So, what's the flight
time of this thing?

528
00:45:05,084 --> 00:45:07,053
About 20 minutes?

529
00:45:07,086 --> 00:45:08,086
Maybe?

530
00:45:09,088 --> 00:45:12,025
Well, I guess we'll find out.

531
00:45:30,709 --> 00:45:33,088
So, which way
you wanna hunt, Jake?

532
00:45:33,112 --> 00:45:34,814
I think I'm gonna go that way.

533
00:45:34,881 --> 00:45:35,915
Okay, good.

534
00:45:39,152 --> 00:45:40,985
What do you mean, good?

535
00:45:42,221 --> 00:45:43,265
Obviously, you didn't
see the deer tracks

536
00:45:43,289 --> 00:45:46,368
headin' off in that direction.

537
00:45:46,392 --> 00:45:49,471
But, hey, if you wanna
go down that way,

538
00:45:49,495 --> 00:45:51,764
be my guest, but you
might starve to death.

539
00:45:54,133 --> 00:45:55,134
I'm gonna go this way.

540
00:46:18,524 --> 00:46:20,126
Gunshot, gunshot.

541
00:46:23,696 --> 00:46:25,362
What was that?

542
00:46:29,602 --> 00:46:32,247
Jesus, Jake, somebody's
shootin' at us.

543
00:46:32,271 --> 00:46:33,748
Jesus Christ.

544
00:46:33,772 --> 00:46:35,308
Hey!

545
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:38,611
Stop shooting!

546
00:46:38,644 --> 00:46:39,724
There are people down here!

547
00:46:43,049 --> 00:46:45,484
Ah, god damn you!

548
00:46:45,518 --> 00:46:47,796
- Shit!
- Hunters down here

549
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:49,322
for Christ's sake!

550
00:46:57,730 --> 00:46:59,008
If somebody makes a
mistake like that,

551
00:46:59,032 --> 00:47:00,842
they're supposed to
identify themselves

552
00:47:00,866 --> 00:47:02,844
and come down to make sure
that nobody's injured.

553
00:47:02,868 --> 00:47:04,479
Doesn't make any sense.

554
00:47:04,503 --> 00:47:05,514
Are you okay?

555
00:47:05,538 --> 00:47:06,505
- Yeah.
- Have you been hit?

556
00:47:06,539 --> 00:47:07,449
- No, no, no.
- Are you sure?

557
00:47:07,473 --> 00:47:09,342
Yeah, just, it scared me.

558
00:47:09,375 --> 00:47:10,375
Okay.

559
00:47:16,649 --> 00:47:17,649
Jesus!

560
00:47:18,651 --> 00:47:21,354
What the.

561
00:47:21,387 --> 00:47:22,864
Something's wrong.

562
00:47:22,888 --> 00:47:23,888
Oh, God.

563
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:30,863
Okay, someone is
definitely shooting at us.

564
00:47:30,896 --> 00:47:32,507
So, ditch those,
but hold onto 'em.

565
00:47:32,531 --> 00:47:34,576
We might need them
later on, okay?

566
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,035
Okay, okay.

567
00:47:36,069 --> 00:47:38,547
Seems to me this guy's
at least 600 yards away.

568
00:47:38,571 --> 00:47:40,182
- The gun, the gun.
- Jake, come back here!

569
00:47:40,206 --> 00:47:42,751
Jesus Christ,

570
00:47:42,775 --> 00:47:43,919
what are you doing?

571
00:47:43,943 --> 00:47:45,343
I'm fine, I'm fine,
we need the gun.

572
00:47:46,912 --> 00:47:48,047
Just take the gun.

573
00:47:48,081 --> 00:47:49,680
Here, here.

574
00:47:58,591 --> 00:47:59,625
- Dad.
- Yeah?

575
00:48:00,593 --> 00:48:02,071
Oh, Jesus.

576
00:48:02,095 --> 00:48:05,531
Oh, God.

577
00:48:15,941 --> 00:48:17,519
Damn it.

578
00:48:17,543 --> 00:48:19,288
Okay, that means we better
be back to base camp

579
00:48:19,312 --> 00:48:21,380
- within 24 hours, am I right?
- Yeah, 24 hours.

580
00:48:21,414 --> 00:48:22,591
Okay.

581
00:48:22,615 --> 00:48:23,758
Right now, we gotta
make it to the water.

582
00:48:23,782 --> 00:48:25,094
- Okay.
- It'll lead us back to camp.

583
00:48:25,118 --> 00:48:26,752
Stay low, hug the rocks.

584
00:48:26,785 --> 00:48:30,489
Let's move.

585
00:49:04,523 --> 00:49:06,525
Watch your step here.

586
00:49:10,696 --> 00:49:12,031
Let's take five.

587
00:49:18,837 --> 00:49:19,837
You okay?

588
00:49:23,042 --> 00:49:24,986
Look, he could be chasing us.

589
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:26,421
We should, we should either
go through the water,

590
00:49:26,445 --> 00:49:28,157
or find a place
somewhere down here

591
00:49:28,181 --> 00:49:30,216
to hide and wait for him.

592
00:49:32,318 --> 00:49:33,495
I don't know, Jake,
neither one sounds

593
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:35,654
like a good idea to me.

594
00:49:35,688 --> 00:49:37,166
We're too exposed in the water.

595
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:41,026
We'd have to draw him real
close to be of any effect.

596
00:49:48,201 --> 00:49:49,868
Jesus, what is that?

597
00:49:50,869 --> 00:49:52,037
You hear that?

598
00:49:55,908 --> 00:49:56,908
Yeah.

599
00:49:57,876 --> 00:50:00,546
Yeah, it sounds
like, it's a drone!

600
00:50:03,749 --> 00:50:06,528
Jesus,
you think it's his?

601
00:50:06,552 --> 00:50:08,987
I mean, it seems like we
would have heard it before.

602
00:50:09,021 --> 00:50:10,031
Could it be someone else?

603
00:50:10,055 --> 00:50:11,690
Is it a search party?

604
00:50:11,724 --> 00:50:14,869
Why would anyone
be searching for us?

605
00:50:14,893 --> 00:50:16,595
Well, it's either him
or it's someone else,

606
00:50:16,662 --> 00:50:17,972
but if it's someone
else, we're gonna miss

607
00:50:17,996 --> 00:50:19,263
our chance at being seen.

608
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:25,171
Okay, let's just stay
behind the rocks for now.

609
00:50:35,381 --> 00:50:36,825
There you go.

610
00:50:36,849 --> 00:50:39,494
Come on, you see that?

611
00:50:39,518 --> 00:50:40,719
Can you see that?

612
00:50:40,753 --> 00:50:43,031
There, right
there, you see him?

613
00:50:43,055 --> 00:50:44,055
Come on.

614
00:51:04,277 --> 00:51:06,721
Jesus, he just shot it down.

615
00:51:06,745 --> 00:51:09,482
Well, that proves
it's not his.

616
00:51:23,996 --> 00:51:25,164
Oh, fuck.

617
00:51:28,634 --> 00:51:29,802
Fuck, you hit?

618
00:51:29,835 --> 00:51:31,069
No, I don't, I don't think so.

619
00:51:34,607 --> 00:51:35,884
Oh, fuck.

620
00:51:35,908 --> 00:51:37,386
Fuck, we gotta go.

621
00:51:37,410 --> 00:51:39,120
Move, stay low, stay low.

622
00:51:39,144 --> 00:51:42,291
Down, down, move, move!

623
00:51:42,315 --> 00:51:43,315
Move!

624
00:51:48,454 --> 00:51:50,499
There's somebody
flying that thing, right?

625
00:51:50,523 --> 00:51:52,858
Where's the closest
ridgeline, Jake?

626
00:51:52,925 --> 00:51:55,794
Uh, closest
ridgeline's that way.

627
00:51:59,164 --> 00:52:00,108
Can you make it?

628
00:52:00,132 --> 00:52:01,133
- Yeah.
- You good?

629
00:52:01,166 --> 00:52:02,499
- Yeah.
- Be careful, let's go.

630
00:52:10,008 --> 00:52:11,544
Come on, come on.

631
00:52:14,547 --> 00:52:15,547
Oh, shit.

632
00:52:16,649 --> 00:52:17,649
Oh, fuck.

633
00:52:18,884 --> 00:52:20,986
Okay, we still have the
radio in the truck, right?

634
00:52:21,019 --> 00:52:22,197
Okay, get back there.

635
00:52:22,221 --> 00:52:24,657
Tell your father we
need backup right now.

636
00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:26,935
If I can't make it
back to the truck,

637
00:52:26,959 --> 00:52:28,959
you're out here alone.

638
00:52:31,196 --> 00:52:34,166
You know what we're
up against, right?

639
00:52:34,199 --> 00:52:37,145
Okay.

640
00:52:37,169 --> 00:52:39,481
We better get to the Kimbers.

641
00:52:39,505 --> 00:52:40,573
Stay with me.

642
00:53:17,676 --> 00:53:18,711
Frank Kimber!

643
00:53:19,678 --> 00:53:22,591
We're not here to hurt you.

644
00:53:22,615 --> 00:53:25,951
Then step out
and show me your hands!

645
00:53:26,018 --> 00:53:28,997
We're not the ones
shooting at you.

646
00:53:29,021 --> 00:53:31,256
But he's not far behind us.

647
00:53:33,526 --> 00:53:35,428
Who the hell are you?

648
00:53:38,864 --> 00:53:40,599
We're stepping out.

649
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:42,701
Don't shoot.

650
00:53:45,771 --> 00:53:47,973
Keep your hands up, Deputy.

651
00:53:59,251 --> 00:54:00,419
Stay.

652
00:54:01,754 --> 00:54:02,755
Easy, easy.

653
00:54:06,659 --> 00:54:07,659
It's okay.

654
00:54:08,727 --> 00:54:12,140
Okay, who are you
and what's goin' on?

655
00:54:12,164 --> 00:54:15,477
Now, you know the
deputy here, huh?

656
00:54:15,501 --> 00:54:16,945
Yeah.

657
00:54:16,969 --> 00:54:19,104
My name's Nolan Gray
from British Intelligence.

658
00:54:19,137 --> 00:54:22,050
I'm here to protect you both.

659
00:54:22,074 --> 00:54:23,885
We've already lost
one of our team,

660
00:54:23,909 --> 00:54:26,220
Agent Butler from the FBI.

661
00:54:26,244 --> 00:54:27,389
There's information, sir,

662
00:54:27,413 --> 00:54:28,947
you don't know
about your son here.

663
00:54:28,981 --> 00:54:30,158
You are both in grave danger,

664
00:54:30,182 --> 00:54:33,251
more than you could
possibly imagine.

665
00:54:36,689 --> 00:54:38,833
I need to know
what's goin' on.

666
00:54:38,857 --> 00:54:40,001
And I'm happy to tell you.

667
00:54:40,025 --> 00:54:41,126
On the move.

668
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:43,429
We need to leave right now.

669
00:54:46,665 --> 00:54:47,665
Son.

670
00:54:50,168 --> 00:54:52,004
Do we have a choice?

671
00:54:55,173 --> 00:54:56,173
Please.

672
00:54:59,344 --> 00:55:00,446
Okay, okay.

673
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,525
Deputy, lead the way.

674
00:55:03,549 --> 00:55:04,783
- It's a climb.
- Stay close.

675
00:55:04,817 --> 00:55:05,660
But this is the only way out.

676
00:55:05,684 --> 00:55:08,018
Come on, double time.

677
00:55:18,531 --> 00:55:20,399
During the civil
wars of Yugoslavia,

678
00:55:20,466 --> 00:55:24,470
there were war lords who operated
their own private armies.

679
00:55:24,503 --> 00:55:27,816
One of these men operated on
a particularly brutal scale.

680
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:30,284
He was called The Tiger.

681
00:55:30,308 --> 00:55:31,853
Many of that war's
worst massacres

682
00:55:31,877 --> 00:55:34,880
were carried out by his men.

683
00:55:34,913 --> 00:55:37,358
He would cleanse entire
villages of anyone

684
00:55:37,382 --> 00:55:40,361
he would consider inferior;

685
00:55:40,385 --> 00:55:43,364
Croats, Bosniaks,
Jews, Kosovars.

686
00:55:43,388 --> 00:55:47,225
Kill the men and use their
women as his personal toys.

687
00:55:47,259 --> 00:55:50,260
Slaves to abuse as he pleased.

688
00:56:04,443 --> 00:56:08,557
There's no telling how many
women and girls he assaulted.

689
00:56:08,581 --> 00:56:12,718
He kept them until he
was bored with them

690
00:56:12,751 --> 00:56:15,085
or until they became pregnant.

691
00:57:47,179 --> 00:57:48,623
Paperwork said
Jake's mother and father

692
00:57:48,647 --> 00:57:50,525
were killed in the war.

693
00:57:50,549 --> 00:57:53,285
That's because some agencies
decided to not let truth

694
00:57:53,318 --> 00:57:56,388
get in the way of
protecting a child.

695
00:57:57,489 --> 00:57:58,833
Especially when
they're a war criminal.

696
00:57:58,857 --> 00:58:02,003
Wait, wait, wait
are you saying,

697
00:58:02,027 --> 00:58:05,798
are you saying that I
was conceived in a rape?

698
00:58:09,534 --> 00:58:10,534
Jesus.

699
00:58:13,038 --> 00:58:14,015
Your biological father, Jake,

700
00:58:14,039 --> 00:58:16,317
is a man named Rasto Boranovic.

701
00:58:16,341 --> 00:58:18,052
He was indicted for war crimes

702
00:58:18,076 --> 00:58:19,678
including what he
did to your mother.

703
00:58:20,979 --> 00:58:22,523
We've been hunting
him for 20 years,

704
00:58:22,547 --> 00:58:24,983
and last week we got him.

705
00:58:25,017 --> 00:58:27,028
He's in custody awaiting
trial in The Hague.

706
00:58:27,052 --> 00:58:28,687
And that's why
we're being shot at?

707
00:58:28,721 --> 00:58:31,332
Boranovic disappeared
along with his private army.

708
00:58:31,356 --> 00:58:33,802
He's become a very powerful
figure in organized crime,

709
00:58:33,826 --> 00:58:35,403
exporting drugs
into Eastern Europe.

710
00:58:35,427 --> 00:58:38,430
Always buys from a
cartel in Mexico.

711
00:58:40,032 --> 00:58:42,577
Now, they lose their Boranovic,

712
00:58:42,601 --> 00:58:45,938
they lose a huge
foothold in the market.

713
00:58:48,707 --> 00:58:51,820
The man hunting you, he's
a professional killer.

714
00:58:51,844 --> 00:58:53,888
He'll kill every one
of us to get to you.

715
00:58:53,912 --> 00:58:57,249
But how does killing
these two protect Boranovic?

716
00:58:57,282 --> 00:59:01,954
Because Jake here is the
evidence that will put him away.

717
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:04,498
Jake, your biological
mother's still alive.

718
00:59:04,522 --> 00:59:07,068
She's going to testify.

719
00:59:07,092 --> 00:59:09,427
Now, with your
DNA and her story,

720
00:59:09,461 --> 00:59:10,939
we put Boranovic, your
father, away for...

721
00:59:10,963 --> 00:59:13,231
Don't call him my father!

722
00:59:16,201 --> 00:59:17,770
He's not my father.

723
00:59:20,639 --> 00:59:21,907
Who caught this guy?

724
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:22,940
I did.

725
00:59:27,479 --> 00:59:29,147
What about my mother?

726
00:59:29,214 --> 00:59:30,949
My biological mother?

727
00:59:33,285 --> 00:59:35,930
When I found her,
she was in Sarajevo.

728
00:59:35,954 --> 00:59:39,725
She's taking a great
risk testifying.

729
00:59:39,758 --> 00:59:41,927
She's a brave woman, Jake.

730
00:59:43,962 --> 00:59:46,474
Okay, look, this
doesn't make any sense.

731
00:59:46,498 --> 00:59:48,276
There's gotta be more
evidence than just Jake.

732
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:49,778
Oh, we have a lot
of evidence, Frank.

733
00:59:49,802 --> 00:59:52,137
Most of it's circumstantial.

734
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:58,076
We did find another offspring,
a half-brother to you.

735
00:59:58,110 --> 01:00:01,589
But four days ago,
he disappeared.

736
01:00:01,613 --> 01:00:03,782
And we haven't found
a trace of him.

737
01:00:11,523 --> 01:00:15,961
How did this guy find
us all the way out here?

738
01:00:15,994 --> 01:00:17,830
Did he go to my house?

739
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,135
Is my wife okay?

740
01:00:31,509 --> 01:00:32,509
No.

741
01:00:34,012 --> 01:00:35,089
Oh, God, no.

742
01:00:35,113 --> 01:00:36,324
We haven't found a body yet.

743
01:00:36,348 --> 01:00:37,591
- Deputy!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait,

744
01:00:37,615 --> 01:00:38,993
wait so, she could
still be alive?

745
01:00:39,017 --> 01:00:40,328
- Please, Jake.
- No, no, she could!

746
01:00:40,352 --> 01:00:41,830
She could, yes.

747
01:00:41,854 --> 01:00:46,000
But the way the man does things,
we don't find bodies, Jake.

748
01:00:46,024 --> 01:00:47,159
He makes people disappear.

749
01:00:47,192 --> 01:00:48,436
That's what he does.

750
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:49,460
I'm sorry.

751
01:00:52,297 --> 01:00:54,297
I'm sorry, Frank.

752
01:00:57,302 --> 01:01:00,172
They killed my
mom because of me?

753
01:01:01,907 --> 01:01:03,909
Did they kill my
mom because of me?

754
01:01:03,976 --> 01:01:05,310
No, Jesus, no.

755
01:01:10,983 --> 01:01:12,193
Based upon the shot
that killed my partner,

756
01:01:12,217 --> 01:01:15,153
he's a mile, maybe
less, behind us.

757
01:01:15,187 --> 01:01:18,556
I'm sorry, Frank, we
have to keep moving.

758
01:01:20,725 --> 01:01:21,725
I'm sorry.

759
01:01:24,496 --> 01:01:25,831
Oh, Jesus, no.

760
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:28,900
Dad.

761
01:01:32,037 --> 01:01:34,737
Dad, I'm so sorry.

762
01:01:37,109 --> 01:01:38,610
Frank.

763
01:01:40,278 --> 01:01:41,489
Frank, we've gotta keep moving.

764
01:01:41,513 --> 01:01:43,681
We have to leave.

765
01:01:46,584 --> 01:01:48,729
Lead us
out of here, Deputy.

766
01:01:48,753 --> 01:01:49,753
Come on.

767
01:02:33,265 --> 01:02:34,265
June?

768
01:02:34,967 --> 01:02:36,544
They should've been back by now.

769
01:02:36,568 --> 01:02:37,735
Any word?

770
01:02:37,769 --> 01:02:39,838
Not since this morning.

771
01:02:41,806 --> 01:02:42,716
All right.

772
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:44,742
Just keep me posted, huh?

773
01:02:50,849 --> 01:02:53,585
So, you work for the
International Criminal Court?

774
01:02:53,618 --> 01:02:54,618
No.

775
01:02:55,988 --> 01:02:58,957
Right now, I'm kind of on loan
from British Intelligence.

776
01:03:00,325 --> 01:03:02,127
I was airborne 10 years.

777
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:05,406
It was a boring time
for an American warrior.

778
01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:07,432
No Afghanistan, no Iraq.

779
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:11,834
Best we got was
Panama and Grenada.

780
01:03:14,472 --> 01:03:16,650
Well, you know how that works.

781
01:03:16,674 --> 01:03:18,676
Luck of the draw, right?

782
01:03:20,478 --> 01:03:22,090
But you came home.

783
01:03:22,114 --> 01:03:24,182
- I'm a lucky guy.
- Yeah.

784
01:03:25,650 --> 01:03:27,828
Look, I really appreciate
you tryin' to save my boy.

785
01:03:27,852 --> 01:03:30,055
But I'm curious, why do it?

786
01:03:31,556 --> 01:03:34,668
Why risk your life
for another country?

787
01:03:34,692 --> 01:03:36,137
I mean, I thank God
every day for Jake,

788
01:03:36,161 --> 01:03:38,563
but I'm curious, what you do?

789
01:03:41,299 --> 01:03:44,946
You think it'll really
make a difference?

790
01:03:44,970 --> 01:03:45,971
I hope so.

791
01:03:48,373 --> 01:03:52,177
What I do know, Frank, is
apathy changes nothing,

792
01:03:52,210 --> 01:03:54,188
and the way I see things,
a parent losing a child,

793
01:03:54,212 --> 01:03:57,082
it's the same pain no
matter where you're from.

794
01:03:57,149 --> 01:04:01,862
I'm tired of borders deciding
who we help and who we don't.

795
01:04:01,886 --> 01:04:05,390
But there'll always
be plenty who get away,

796
01:04:05,423 --> 01:04:09,037
and there will always be
those to replace them.

797
01:04:09,061 --> 01:04:10,562
You're right.

798
01:04:10,595 --> 01:04:11,696
Human nature.

799
01:04:12,931 --> 01:04:17,169
Maybe the threat of life
in prison stops one man.

800
01:04:17,202 --> 01:04:18,980
Then we're saving lives.

801
01:04:19,004 --> 01:04:20,004
Come on.

802
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:36,730
You okay there, Frank?

803
01:04:36,754 --> 01:04:38,957
I, I
may need a minute.

804
01:04:39,024 --> 01:04:39,891
Okay, yeah.

805
01:04:39,924 --> 01:04:41,859
Let's catch our breath.

806
01:04:51,869 --> 01:04:54,239
Are you sure it's just
one guy tracking us?

807
01:04:54,272 --> 01:04:55,749
No.

808
01:04:55,773 --> 01:04:56,850
But I think if there was more,

809
01:04:56,874 --> 01:04:59,411
they'd be triangulating
us by now.

810
01:04:59,444 --> 01:05:04,382
Well, if it's just one guy,
why don't we triangulate him?

811
01:05:05,483 --> 01:05:06,260
Jake, I don't
think you understand

812
01:05:06,284 --> 01:05:07,761
the situation you're in.

813
01:05:07,785 --> 01:05:10,655
This man's been killing people
since he was a teenager.

814
01:05:10,722 --> 01:05:13,467
If we want any chance of
staying alive in this thing,

815
01:05:13,491 --> 01:05:14,726
we stay one step ahead of him.

816
01:05:14,759 --> 01:05:16,404
Now, we didn't
check in which means

817
01:05:16,428 --> 01:05:18,272
search and rescue is behind us.

818
01:05:18,296 --> 01:05:19,497
We get that blood sample,

819
01:05:19,564 --> 01:05:21,709
we get the DNA here
officially on record.

820
01:05:21,733 --> 01:05:25,570
Killing Jake serves no
purpose for them, then.

821
01:05:26,971 --> 01:05:30,451
Look, we stay out of his
way, and we wait for backup.

822
01:05:30,475 --> 01:05:31,619
But it could take
at least another day

823
01:05:31,643 --> 01:05:32,577
to get more men out here.

824
01:05:32,610 --> 01:05:33,787
We don't have another day.

825
01:05:33,811 --> 01:05:35,147
Jake needs to take his medicine.

826
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:36,848
Look, I'm fine as
long as I don't bleed.

827
01:05:36,914 --> 01:05:38,450
And what if you do bleed?

828
01:05:38,483 --> 01:05:39,393
What if you get shot?

829
01:05:39,417 --> 01:05:40,961
What if you fall and bruise?

830
01:05:40,985 --> 01:05:42,654
Safest bet, we go back
through base camp.

831
01:05:42,687 --> 01:05:44,756
Frank, listen, I saw it.

832
01:05:44,789 --> 01:05:47,235
Your ATVs are trashed
and everything you had.

833
01:05:47,259 --> 01:05:50,262
We head that way, we're
heading straight for him.

834
01:05:50,295 --> 01:05:51,605
There's a little
town called Titus.

835
01:05:51,629 --> 01:05:53,507
It's about 12 miles from here.

836
01:05:53,531 --> 01:05:55,009
It's really just a
bar and a gas station,

837
01:05:55,033 --> 01:05:56,768
but it's the closest
place to find people.

838
01:05:56,801 --> 01:05:58,136
Good, let's do that.

839
01:05:58,170 --> 01:06:00,148
No, no, no, no way!

840
01:06:00,172 --> 01:06:02,350
Keep your fucking voice down.

841
01:06:02,374 --> 01:06:04,042
I am trying to keep you alive.

842
01:06:04,109 --> 01:06:05,610
Do you hear me?

843
01:06:09,047 --> 01:06:10,148
I know this man.

844
01:06:10,182 --> 01:06:13,527
He's a very dangerous
human being.

845
01:06:13,551 --> 01:06:15,153
We keep moving.

846
01:06:15,187 --> 01:06:16,997
I agree with Gray.

847
01:06:17,021 --> 01:06:18,356
You're a fucking coward.

848
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:20,125
Jake, that is enough.

849
01:06:20,158 --> 01:06:21,326
Hey, get moving.

850
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:26,331
Get up, get up, get up.

851
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:28,633
Get a handle on your boy.

852
01:06:32,870 --> 01:06:34,215
Hey.

853
01:06:34,239 --> 01:06:36,350
Stay calm, we'll get
through this, okay?

854
01:06:36,374 --> 01:06:37,374
- Okay.
- Come on.

855
01:06:40,578 --> 01:06:41,513
Is there any way we can get

856
01:06:41,546 --> 01:06:44,358
that chopper back here by dawn?

857
01:06:44,382 --> 01:06:46,026
Aw, hell no, son.

858
01:06:46,050 --> 01:06:48,629
Christ, look, I got three
men unaccounted for.

859
01:06:48,653 --> 01:06:51,487
I need to be in the
air at first light.

860
01:06:53,658 --> 01:06:55,893
June, can you come in here?

861
01:06:57,395 --> 01:06:59,006
Yeah, Sheriff?

862
01:06:59,030 --> 01:07:00,908
I need you to
call Bill Miller.

863
01:07:00,932 --> 01:07:02,743
- Bill Miller?
- Yes, Bill Miller.

864
01:07:02,767 --> 01:07:04,536
I know he's an ass,
but his brother

865
01:07:04,569 --> 01:07:06,347
and he's got that
crop duster, yeah?

866
01:07:06,371 --> 01:07:08,182
- Yeah?
- All right.

867
01:07:08,206 --> 01:07:10,651
Ask him to have that thing here
first thing in the morning.

868
01:07:10,675 --> 01:07:12,877
All right, I'll call him.

869
01:07:35,032 --> 01:07:37,034
You doin' okay?

870
01:07:43,608 --> 01:07:47,545
I'm sorry for the
way I acted earlier.

871
01:07:47,579 --> 01:07:51,414
Jake, you have
nothing to be sorry for.

872
01:07:53,451 --> 01:07:57,453
A lot of things have
changed for you today.

873
01:07:58,590 --> 01:08:00,992
You've been braver than most.

874
01:08:06,298 --> 01:08:11,303
I, uh, I just
feel like my whole life's a lie.

875
01:08:18,142 --> 01:08:21,346
I can't believe my mom's dead.

876
01:08:21,413 --> 01:08:24,616
I'm sorry.

877
01:08:24,649 --> 01:08:27,819
You shouldn't have
to go through this.

878
01:08:32,857 --> 01:08:36,027
You know, I see how
much your dad loves you.

879
01:08:36,093 --> 01:08:38,263
He wants you to be strong.

880
01:08:40,765 --> 01:08:42,009
You have to be strong
for each other.

881
01:08:42,033 --> 01:08:43,201
You know that?

882
01:08:51,609 --> 01:08:54,154
I'm gonna keep an eye
open tonight, Jake.

883
01:08:54,178 --> 01:08:56,881
Try and get some
rest if you can.

884
01:08:59,651 --> 01:09:00,818
Hang in there.

885
01:09:02,019 --> 01:09:03,120
Hang in there.

886
01:10:44,121 --> 01:10:45,065
I heard motorcycles.

887
01:10:45,089 --> 01:10:45,866
That could be the search party.

888
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:47,100
Not a chance.

889
01:10:47,124 --> 01:10:48,268
They'll be coming in
by air or by foot.

890
01:10:48,292 --> 01:10:50,471
He's right, son.

891
01:10:50,495 --> 01:10:52,139
Look, I found
the perfect spot.

892
01:10:52,163 --> 01:10:53,598
High ground over here.

893
01:10:53,631 --> 01:10:55,075
Perfect for cover.

894
01:10:55,099 --> 01:10:56,644
No matter what, they
don't know where you are.

895
01:10:56,668 --> 01:10:58,069
Do not compromise your position.

896
01:10:58,102 --> 01:11:00,714
He's right, stay
put, stay low.

897
01:11:00,738 --> 01:11:02,450
What if you don't come back?

898
01:11:02,474 --> 01:11:03,841
We keep moving.

899
01:11:05,309 --> 01:11:06,954
- You got this?
- Yeah.

900
01:11:06,978 --> 01:11:09,779
Let's move out, come on.

901
01:11:17,855 --> 01:11:20,358
They're headed your way.

902
01:11:20,425 --> 01:11:25,430
Spread out and wait.

903
01:11:36,508 --> 01:11:38,209
Let's play.

904
01:11:40,678 --> 01:11:42,279
Get down.

905
01:11:44,616 --> 01:11:46,694
He's
coming back, right?

906
01:11:46,718 --> 01:11:49,387
He knows what he's doing.

907
01:13:06,864 --> 01:13:09,366
Ah, I should have
killed you in Budapest

908
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:10,578
when I had the chance.

909
01:13:10,602 --> 01:13:13,237
I don't remember
you having a chance.

910
01:14:15,332 --> 01:14:17,702
This didn't need to happen.

911
01:14:19,704 --> 01:14:22,273
Now, you start listening to me.

912
01:14:27,044 --> 01:14:28,379
We need to move.

913
01:14:30,281 --> 01:14:32,149
Come on, we gotta go, come on.

914
01:14:32,183 --> 01:14:33,685
Let's go.

915
01:14:36,954 --> 01:14:37,989
Stay with me.

916
01:15:17,161 --> 01:15:18,996
Hey, you see anyone?

917
01:15:19,030 --> 01:15:20,531
No, we're clear.

918
01:15:23,601 --> 01:15:25,045
Hey, hey, hey.

919
01:15:25,069 --> 01:15:26,237
How bad is it?

920
01:15:27,538 --> 01:15:28,538
It's bad.

921
01:15:29,573 --> 01:15:30,718
I don't know, maybe it's a disc.

922
01:15:30,742 --> 01:15:32,409
I just, I need rest.

923
01:15:34,879 --> 01:15:37,381
I'm just gonna
slow you guys down.

924
01:15:40,618 --> 01:15:42,687
Then we stay here
and finish this,

925
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:43,597
and wait for search and rescue.

926
01:15:43,621 --> 01:15:45,289
They gotta be close.

927
01:15:48,292 --> 01:15:49,694
Are you sure?

928
01:15:49,727 --> 01:15:51,228
You can't make it?

929
01:15:53,931 --> 01:15:55,175
Jake, we can't make assumptions.

930
01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:57,344
We don't know how many
people are out there.

931
01:15:57,368 --> 01:15:58,345
I gotta get you to Titus.

932
01:15:58,369 --> 01:15:59,536
No, no, no!

933
01:15:59,570 --> 01:16:00,738
Fuck that!

934
01:16:00,772 --> 01:16:03,516
Son, you're already
on borrowed time.

935
01:16:03,540 --> 01:16:05,518
Come on, we've
been through this.

936
01:16:05,542 --> 01:16:08,377
All it takes is a
bruise, a gunshot.

937
01:16:09,981 --> 01:16:11,148
No way, Dad.

938
01:16:12,049 --> 01:16:14,461
I cannot lose you, too.

939
01:16:14,485 --> 01:16:15,820
Listen to me, okay?

940
01:16:15,887 --> 01:16:17,264
Just listen to me.

941
01:16:17,288 --> 01:16:18,455
I can make it out here.

942
01:16:18,489 --> 01:16:20,557
I can survive, come
on, you know me!

943
01:16:20,591 --> 01:16:21,401
There's plenty of food.

944
01:16:21,425 --> 01:16:23,260
I'll be, I'll be fine.

945
01:16:24,829 --> 01:16:27,107
I'll be fine, okay?

946
01:16:27,131 --> 01:16:28,332
I'll be fine.

947
01:16:28,399 --> 01:16:31,435
Your only hope is for
you guys to get out

948
01:16:31,468 --> 01:16:33,580
and come back with help.

949
01:16:33,604 --> 01:16:35,606
There's no other choice.

950
01:16:40,845 --> 01:16:42,823
I'm coming back for you.

951
01:16:42,847 --> 01:16:45,282
Oh, I know you will.

952
01:16:47,952 --> 01:16:48,952
Jake.

953
01:16:49,987 --> 01:16:51,655
Come on, get outta here.

954
01:16:53,590 --> 01:16:54,658
I'll get him!

955
01:16:58,863 --> 01:17:00,297
Got you.

956
01:17:07,604 --> 01:17:08,806
Come on, Frank.

957
01:17:09,673 --> 01:17:10,673
Come on.

958
01:17:27,491 --> 01:17:28,491
Jesus.

959
01:18:06,864 --> 01:18:09,033
Where's the boy?

960
01:18:16,407 --> 01:18:17,775
I have no clue.

961
01:18:20,744 --> 01:18:22,246
Where's the boy?

962
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:28,853
What do you want me to say?

963
01:18:28,886 --> 01:18:31,555
He took a left at the evergreen?

964
01:18:39,363 --> 01:18:43,700
Even if I did know, I
wouldn't tell you, so come on.

965
01:18:45,402 --> 01:18:46,402
Go ahead.

966
01:18:59,316 --> 01:19:01,052
Did you kill my wife?

967
01:19:06,958 --> 01:19:07,958
Did you?

968
01:19:10,594 --> 01:19:13,931
Did you?

969
01:19:41,258 --> 01:19:42,759
Oh, is Sarah here?

970
01:19:45,596 --> 01:19:48,299
She's, um, she's
incapacitated.

971
01:19:49,333 --> 01:19:50,801
Oh, nothin' serious, I hope.

972
01:19:50,834 --> 01:19:52,079
No, no.

973
01:19:52,103 --> 01:19:55,106
Um, she's, uh, she's
just not available.

974
01:19:56,773 --> 01:19:58,275
I'm the gardener.

975
01:19:58,309 --> 01:19:59,987
Oh, well, uh, could, could
you see that she gets these?

976
01:20:00,011 --> 01:20:01,421
We just wanted to
welcome 'em back.

977
01:20:01,445 --> 01:20:02,813
They're really nice people.

978
01:20:02,846 --> 01:20:05,349
- Very nice.
- Real neighborly.

979
01:20:08,953 --> 01:20:10,998
Okay, I'll, um, I'll
let her know you came by.

980
01:20:11,022 --> 01:20:12,789
If, if, if you wanna
sneak a couple of those,

981
01:20:12,823 --> 01:20:14,525
I won't tell anybody.

982
01:20:35,712 --> 01:20:37,748
And now my son?

983
01:20:40,985 --> 01:20:41,985
Your son?

984
01:20:43,554 --> 01:20:45,256
He's not your son.

985
01:20:45,322 --> 01:20:47,700
He's not your blood.

986
01:20:47,724 --> 01:20:49,026
Why do you care?

987
01:20:53,697 --> 01:20:56,700
Why do I.

988
01:21:03,107 --> 01:21:06,443
I spent 18 years of
my life raising him.

989
01:21:09,213 --> 01:21:10,714
Watching him grow.

990
01:21:12,049 --> 01:21:14,551
Teaching him right from wrong.

991
01:21:22,559 --> 01:21:25,229
It's obvious to
me that you never

992
01:21:25,262 --> 01:21:28,465
had a father do the
same thing for you.

993
01:22:15,146 --> 01:22:16,656
Gray.

994
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:17,948
Yeah, I know.

995
01:22:19,816 --> 01:22:21,161
Look, Jake, going back
there right now goes

996
01:22:21,185 --> 01:22:24,355
against everything
we should be doing.

997
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:30,960
Fuck it.

998
01:22:31,828 --> 01:22:33,264
Let's go get him.

999
01:22:34,165 --> 01:22:35,165
Come on.

1000
01:23:04,195 --> 01:23:05,129
It's an ambush.

1001
01:23:05,162 --> 01:23:07,331
He doesn't know we're here.

1002
01:23:07,364 --> 01:23:08,364
Oh, Jesus.

1003
01:23:11,368 --> 01:23:12,779
Okay, you're gonna have
to go ahead without me.

1004
01:23:12,803 --> 01:23:14,838
No, no, I can help you.

1005
01:23:16,507 --> 01:23:19,376
No, I made a
promise to your dad.

1006
01:23:21,345 --> 01:23:22,513
You go this way.

1007
01:23:22,546 --> 01:23:23,356
A mile, maybe two.

1008
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:24,515
Find a place to hide.

1009
01:23:24,548 --> 01:23:25,992
You wait for me.

1010
01:23:26,016 --> 01:23:29,662
You don't see me in one hour,
get to that town by dark.

1011
01:23:29,686 --> 01:23:30,686
Okay?

1012
01:23:32,723 --> 01:23:34,825
- Okay.
- Go on, Jake, go.

1013
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:05,565
Oh, shit.

1014
01:24:05,589 --> 01:24:06,399
No, no, no.

1015
01:24:06,423 --> 01:24:08,859
No, no, no, no, no.

1016
01:24:53,437 --> 01:24:54,437
Shit.

1017
01:24:59,176 --> 01:25:00,176
Gray!

1018
01:25:01,144 --> 01:25:02,446
Can you hear me?

1019
01:25:05,482 --> 01:25:06,483
I'm unarmed.

1020
01:25:32,509 --> 01:25:34,211
Turn around.

1021
01:25:40,351 --> 01:25:41,552
It's just me.

1022
01:25:50,327 --> 01:25:51,771
You know, I always
wondered how things

1023
01:25:51,795 --> 01:25:53,797
would end up between us.

1024
01:25:55,299 --> 01:25:56,299
You?

1025
01:25:59,470 --> 01:26:01,872
Seems you have the advantage.

1026
01:26:08,679 --> 01:26:10,557
Stay where you are.

1027
01:26:10,581 --> 01:26:13,417
I have enough
reasons to kill you.

1028
01:26:19,690 --> 01:26:21,892
Gray, always by the book.

1029
01:26:25,028 --> 01:26:27,564
And now you're gonna arrest me?

1030
01:26:28,532 --> 01:26:30,142
Yeah.

1031
01:26:30,166 --> 01:26:31,668
Probably should.

1032
01:26:33,169 --> 01:26:37,717
Might go look for that, uh,
little daughter of yours,

1033
01:26:37,741 --> 01:26:40,277
that pretty wife, if you don't.

1034
01:26:49,252 --> 01:26:51,788
Tryin' to push my buttons, Z?

1035
01:26:56,026 --> 01:26:58,529
We could settle it here.

1036
01:26:58,562 --> 01:27:00,096
Just the two of us.

1037
01:27:01,097 --> 01:27:02,899
- If you want.
- I don't.

1038
01:27:13,377 --> 01:27:15,211
I'm gonna walk you in.

1039
01:27:16,212 --> 01:27:18,749
You're going to stand trial, Z.

1040
01:27:29,626 --> 01:27:30,894
In that case.

1041
01:28:15,005 --> 01:28:18,317
Hand me the tele,
the telephone.

1042
01:28:18,341 --> 01:28:21,845
The telephone.

1043
01:28:49,039 --> 01:28:51,307
She's, she's just learning.

1044
01:28:55,211 --> 01:28:56,212
Mine, too.

1045
01:29:05,856 --> 01:29:09,993
Hope, hope she knows
how, how proud I am of her.

1046
01:29:18,234 --> 01:29:21,738
She will.

1047
01:30:10,954 --> 01:30:11,988
Is it done?

1048
01:30:16,259 --> 01:30:19,963
It's done.

1049
01:31:05,642 --> 01:31:06,642
Dad!

1050
01:31:10,681 --> 01:31:11,791
Dad!

1051
01:31:11,815 --> 01:31:14,150
Is that you, Jake?

1052
01:31:19,155 --> 01:31:20,889
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- I'm okay.

1053
01:31:22,693 --> 01:31:24,060
Are you okay?

1054
01:31:24,127 --> 01:31:25,662
- Are you shot?
- It was just a graze.

1055
01:31:25,696 --> 01:31:26,939
I'm okay.

1056
01:31:26,963 --> 01:31:29,441
The rest helped, but I'm
still in a little pain.

1057
01:31:29,465 --> 01:31:31,010
Jesus, Jake, you're cut.

1058
01:31:31,034 --> 01:31:32,235
No, I'm fine, I'm fine.

1059
01:31:32,302 --> 01:31:34,013
I'm okay, I have time.

1060
01:31:34,037 --> 01:31:35,706
Can you walk?

1061
01:31:35,739 --> 01:31:38,074
Where's Gray?

1062
01:31:41,211 --> 01:31:42,021
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1063
01:31:42,045 --> 01:31:43,313
Come on.

1064
01:31:43,346 --> 01:31:44,180
Come on.

1065
01:31:44,214 --> 01:31:46,314
Okay.

1066
01:32:35,598 --> 01:32:37,409
Oh, oh, got you.

1067
01:32:37,433 --> 01:32:39,936
- Mom, Dad!
- Help me.

1068
01:32:42,806 --> 01:32:44,105
I got you, okay, okay.

1069
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:51,590
We've got you.

1070
01:32:51,614 --> 01:32:52,649
Are you good?

1071
01:32:56,820 --> 01:32:58,452
I got you.

1072
01:33:41,597 --> 01:33:43,509
Jake, relax.

1073
01:33:43,533 --> 01:33:44,701
You look good.

1074
01:33:46,436 --> 01:33:47,847
Do my shoes match my belt?

1075
01:33:47,871 --> 01:33:48,705
That's a thing, right?

1076
01:33:48,772 --> 01:33:50,338
- Shoes and belts?
- Jake.

1077
01:33:51,307 --> 01:33:53,820
Listen, it's your mother.

1078
01:33:53,844 --> 01:33:54,945
Your biological mother.

1079
01:33:54,978 --> 01:33:56,488
She brought you into this world.

1080
01:33:56,512 --> 01:33:59,682
And I promise you,
she's going to love you.

1081
01:33:59,716 --> 01:34:00,884
Okay.

1082
01:34:00,951 --> 01:34:02,161
Okay?

1083
01:34:02,185 --> 01:34:05,055
Okay.

1084
01:34:05,121 --> 01:34:06,265
You know, I wanted to mention,

1085
01:34:06,289 --> 01:34:07,199
if you want to
meet the man that...

1086
01:34:07,223 --> 01:34:09,125
My biological father?

1087
01:34:11,962 --> 01:34:13,272
Uh, no, no.

1088
01:34:13,296 --> 01:34:14,173
There's no need.

1089
01:34:14,197 --> 01:34:16,399
I, I don't owe him anything.

1090
01:34:17,868 --> 01:34:21,347
Your family's what
you make it, right?

1091
01:34:21,371 --> 01:34:23,206
- Is that her?
- It is.

1092
01:34:28,745 --> 01:34:30,480
It's that time, Jake.

1093
01:34:32,148 --> 01:34:33,850
You gonna go see her?

1094
01:34:37,053 --> 01:34:38,054
Thank you.

1095
01:34:40,090 --> 01:34:42,092
Go on, get outta here.

1096
01:35:12,522 --> 01:35:13,857
Change of plans.

1097
01:35:19,295 --> 01:35:20,630
I'm coming home.

1098
