1
00:00:02,902 --> 00:00:05,105
By the end of the Eighties,

2
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:07,630
one out of every three youth in Chile

3
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:16,037
were what you could call, marginal...

4
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:46,568
Candy or spice

5
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,557
CHOLICA I

6
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,225
CHOLICA II CALLING...

7
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,159
CHOLICA I, PLEASE ANSWER.

8
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:06,766
CHOLICA I,
CHOLICA II HERE

9
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:08,199
CHOLICA I, PLEASE ANSWER.

10
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,808
I remember the day I felt on this planet,

11
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:18,107
I was only two megamikes from the goal.

12
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,938
Alone, with no destiny

13
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:27,184
I decided to proceed with my mission,

14
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,650
On first contact with the natives

15
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:40,098
learned that they divided time into days,

16
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,626
This I never figured out,

17
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:45,467
Since all days were the same.

18
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:50,466
They would always just lie there

19
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,677
As it forsaken...

20
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:33,845
I decided to give them my message
anyway.

21
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:43,314
Are you coming or not?

22
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,260
No way Niki

23
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:34,267
Hey kid! Treat the customer well.

24
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:35,996
Don't forget that!

25
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,470
You got a bonus!!

26
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:50,083
Grandpa, is it true you've been here for 30
years?

27
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:56,456
36! When I started cars were for real.

28
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:59,550
Solids not like now.

29
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:04,986
So always the same trip.
You never got bored?

30
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:11,963
Listen kid, time will teach you

31
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:17,565
every day has its little things...

32
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:24,610
You know? Sometimes I got funny ideas,

33
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:31,948
I scare myself; the world seems so crazy...

34
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:39,420
Want some advice? Don't waste your
youth.

35
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,694
It's the best part of life.

36
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,056
OK, Let's bet.

37
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:04,991
OK, lets see now.

38
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,159
A tie!

39
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,227
A tie! That's safe enough

40
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:10,661
Union Española v/s Everton Is it Everton?

41
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,088

42
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:15,802

Local!

Local!

46
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:18,270
Local!

47
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:21,874
Union Española v/s Cobreloa

00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:22,431
A tie

49
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:23,165
A tie

50
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:23,967
Visitor

51
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:24,972

Visitor

55
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:32,176
Visitor

56
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,571
Hand me that joint, loco

57
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:03,873
Here...

58
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,091
Strong, right?

59
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,791
How long are we staying here?

60
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,725
Nothing is happening.

61
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:28,368
Negra, try to score a cigarette at least.

62
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:59,871
Shit, only girls get in for free...

63
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,040
Really? Did you score something?

64
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,914
So lets pitch in and buy booze.

65
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,213
You got money or what?

66
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:20,518
I ain't got one, Bro.

67
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,565
Nothing is happening.

68
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:41,775
You jerks are all crazy...

69
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:44,146
What do you mean nothing doing?

70
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,583
With the guy back there it was all
happening.

71
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,421
Go back then...

72
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:53,514
What's wrong bitch?

73
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,523
What do we do guys?

74
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:03,363
Santiago is boring tonight.

75
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,104
Let's go to your neighbourhood

76
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:13,367
Nah! That shit is really boring...

77
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,990
More boring than shit cruising with you
assholes.

78
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,631
Listen to the bitch!

79
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,447
Fuck you assholes!

80
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:53,452
Got lost bitch! See you in heaven. Got lost!

81
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:55,386
Fuck you assholes!

82
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,886
You don't have the balls to get laid.

83
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:07,226
Lady D! Hand me your skirt to blow my
nose.

84
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,762
Get lost! Get lost assholes!

85
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,073
Don't get eaten by a shark!

86
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:28,576
Let's play a game.

87
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:34,121
It's three pills. So catch one... gets three
wishes.

88
00:11:56,682 --> 00:12:00,345
Baby I'll take one wish

89
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,947
So you can have five wishes.

90
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:04,912
A little present.

91
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,096
These pills are good shit!

92
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:19,768
Totally!

93
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,304
The opium of the masses.

94
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,341
Takes away your hunger...

95
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,138
And makes you a bit more stupid.

96
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:41,545
I'm already getting wired...

97
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:48,252
Cheek it out guy! It's Negra!

98
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,492
Look at that fucking car!

99
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:53,560
Bro. Follow Her!

100
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,202
This is wonderful!

101
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:13,449
Girl, you are trembling!

102
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,454
Are you frightened?

103
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,048
I don't know you.

104
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:20,889
I'm a little scared.

105
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:26,188
Fear? You've got to defeat fear.

106
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,232
Otherwise there's no growth.

107
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:34,773
Look. If I'd been scared,

108
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:37,469
I would've never crossed the Andes.

109
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:40,010
Understand?

110
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:52,049
You could work with me, you know?

111
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,487
Really?

112
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,137
Let's play a game.

113
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:39,263
A game?

114
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:43,575
Listen, you give me a present.

115
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:46,510
And I give you... another present...

116
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:49,945
OK!

117
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,183
Take off your jacket.

118
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:58,088
Aaah, now I got it!

119
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,386
I give you a present...

120
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:10,699
And you give me another present.

121
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,608
Easy!!

122
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,077
Check his pockets!

123
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:27,920
Don't move asshole!

124
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,754
Shit a car!

125
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,222
A car full of Cops!

126
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:32,053
Shut up, Motherfucker!

127
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:10,994
How come you never talk to me?

128
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:21,006
Do you think I'll spend the rest of my life

129
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:22,633
screwing in stolen cars?

130
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,873
And where would you like to get laid?

131
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,086
I'm fed up!

132
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:47,927
Always the same shit.

133
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,165
What are we going to do?

134
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,502
Let's fuck, Negrita...

135
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:08,085
You know I hate this shit...

136
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:14,456
I told you, I don't want to screw in this car!

137
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,261
Bye then.

138
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:28,239
Niki, we've been through a lot
together. Haven't we?

139
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:31,740
Do you think we might break up one day?

140
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:38,575
Don't know Negrita. Bye now...

141
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,130
AND THE NAMES OF THE DAYS WERE

142
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:56,090
MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY,

143
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,437
WITH THEIR GLUE SNIFFING MOONS...

144
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:03,872
CHOLICA I, LOVER AND OUT.

145
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:31,999
Didn't I tell you there was no one here?

146
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:33,771
And the old Lady?

147
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:38,368
She's out; they took her to the beach...

148
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,281
What's that noise?

149
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,550
The old Lady's ghost...

150
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,223
Don't move!!

151
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,657
Hands up!!

152
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:27,478
She saw us!

153
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,770
Waste her! Waste her!

154
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:04,011
Everyday has its little things...

155
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,390
Hey loco, what time is it?

156
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,397
Maybe around five?

157
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,136
Maybe you have something to do?

158
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:34,671
The chick from Ap.34 should be arriving
soon...

159
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:38,875
No doubt, the best thing around.

160
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:43,216
That chick likes money...

161
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,514
But love is much stronger, Bro.

162
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:57,536
What's up?

163
00:23:57,536 --> 00:24:01,233
Here, cloudy turning to cloudy...

164
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:06,176
And

165
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:08,705
You nervous

166
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:16,822
Listen guy, work I do... all under control.

167
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:20,087
Go check what's going on around the
corner.

168
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:23,656
Nasty shit is going on there.

169
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:27,897
Go on!

170
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:29,765
What's going on?

171
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,202
Go! Hey, behind there.

172
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:45,315
And... what beach?

173
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:49,509
All of them! On the bike, Hmm?

174
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:54,456
We'll ask the boy's for little present.

175
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,667
Fucker!

176
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,040
Asshole, you gonna hit me again, jerk of f!

177
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,909
So you are going to hit me again,
motherfucker!

178
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:13,639
You going out with a fucking snoop! Bitch!

179
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:15,812
You're jealous? Asshole!

180
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:23,121
You faggot! Go, go with your buddies,
motherfucker!

181
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:26,858
I'm staying here. I'm leaving this shit!

182
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,960
Leave by yourself, stupid bitch.

183
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,393
Jerk!

184
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:45,210
Listen Bro. The world is full of chicks...

185
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,644
Don't worry, pretty soon...

186
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:19,543
Oh? The darling is home!

187
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:23,603
Hey! That crying is driving me crazy! Do
something!

188
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:26,543
OK now! Let me do my work.

189
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:48,966
Sweetheart go work things out with your
husband.

190
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,537
We each have our room.

191
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:04,948
Don't start with me!

192
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:07,792
Oh, I shouldn't. You are sick or something!

193
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,628
You just hang out all day!

194
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,358
What do you mean! It's me that hassle
around.

195
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,099
What's going on with you! Stop already

196
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:15,300
So, You are staying.

197
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,824
Come here this minute!

198
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,460
Well then, will something happen?

199
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:52,260
Nothing doing, loco...

200
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:55,529
And with Garganta?

201
00:27:56,741 --> 00:28:00,472
Check it out! Totally far out.

202
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:34,105
When I was in the joint I had hope.

203
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:41,042
Getting out, finding something new...

204
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:44,485
To be free.

205
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:50,195
Cut that out. At least here the room is
bigger.

206
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:53,187
And if you fuck up. In you go!

207
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,567
It makes me wonder.

208
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,127
Change that tape. Change the tape!

209
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,393
Shit! What a crybaby.

210
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:03,832
Hey guy. It's rough. No big deal.

211
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:06,675
In the joint people have a different
mentality.

212
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:08,904
They are all winners.

213
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,814
Out here there's no room for you.

214
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:17,122
Here we are the ones that trickle down.

215
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:20,458
Those who snatch, and those waiting for
the trickle.

216
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:21,760
Got it?

217
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,699
Man, we are privileged, chit, privileged!

218
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,758
We haven't got anything to loose, Bro.

219
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:39,532
I want to be a birdie. I want to be a bird.

220
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:51,244
Fuck it, we are under fire! Attacked!

221
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,227
It's mass acclaim! Bro!

222
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:58,354
OK. OK fucker, let's make a pit stop.

223
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,368
I need to take a leak mate.

224
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:08,661
Partner, hey Bro! Don't leave me!

225
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:11,375
Motherfucker!

226
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:19,483
Shit! 2500 watts!

227
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,322
Fuck! Light for everyone.

228
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:28,452
Thanks Mr. Mayor.

229
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:33,565
What solid shit!

230
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:36,466
Solid man! Like you and me!

231
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:42,674
Hey man Bro! Shit's got future is pure light!

232
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,542
Hey guy, where are you going?

233
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:49,547
Hey! Hey Loco! Asshole! This fucker!

234
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:51,674
Are you going crazy?

235
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:38,020
OK kid, sober up and you are out.

236
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,529
And next time leave the bike at home.

237
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:45,268
Sleep tight, sweeties.

238
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:03,115
Guy, Do you have a cigarette?

239
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:17,099
OK! Time to get up!!

240
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:28,112
Listen kids, we need you to give us a hand.

241
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:31,916
We need you for a line up. We need faces.

242
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:35,453
Behave and you are out first thing in the
morning.

243
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,555
And us boss?

244
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:38,647
You are too fucking ugly.

245
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:44,653
Here, stop up, next spot.

246
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:49,100
Show us your numbers. Get up there.

247
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,692
Look up!

248
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:56,605
This way lady. Take your time.

249
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:30,008
I think this is him. It could be
numbers 4 or 5...

250
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:33,569
I didn't have my glasses. I'm not sure.

251
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,620
OK. And the bicycle

252
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,355
I told you it's my brother in law!

253
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,186
What do you mean I told you, fucker.

254
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,796
What's his name?

255
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:55,323
The cat

256
00:33:56,801 --> 00:34:00,237
Cat... Cat who?

257
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:03,638
Orrego. Felipe

258
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:05,900
Where does he live?

259
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:12,282
In my apartment. I gave you the address.

260
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:16,086
Was it with him that you robbed the old
Lady?

261
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:18,054
But I told you I haven't robbed anything.

262
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:23,528
I have a job. I'm a mechanic. Ask if you
want.

263
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:25,296
Why should I steal?

264
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:28,026
That's what I'd like to know.
Why did you do it?

265
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:33,397
But I haven't stolen anything.
I was home that day.

266
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,307
Leave home at dawn, or I lose my job.

267
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:41,012
I support my whole family.

268
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:43,781
Sure, and your mother is unemployed.

269
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:45,683
And your baby is sick, Hmm?

270
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:50,643
It's my sister's baby, and my mother is the
sick one.

271
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:57,328
Hello? Yes.

272
00:34:57,328 --> 00:35:00,320
Listen kid, my patience is running out.

273
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:02,995
We'll give you one more chance...

274
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:05,026
Are we going to be friends?

275
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:13,140
Better tell us everything.

276
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:16,504
There's evidence against you.

277
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:33,829
Wanna talk to you friends? We've got him.

278
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:38,258
So you can work on your story.

279
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,969
It wasn't me.

280
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:02,419
Poor guy.

281
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:09,558
The lady is half blind, and gaga to boot

282
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:13,634
So what do we do?

283
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:16,474
Does he have a record?

284
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:17,406
No, he doesn't

285
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:21,005
Let's let him go.

286
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:25,183
OK. Kid, We'll let you go this time.

287
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:28,209
But, if you've lied. You'll deal with me!

288
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:37,224
It's over, see. You are all day in a daze.

289
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:42,260
The police was here asking about you.

290
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:51,075
It's been very difficult putting all of this
together.

291
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:53,945
I don't need trouble. Let' s leave it at that.

292
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:57,815
OK, you go...

293
00:36:57,815 --> 00:37:00,750
haven't told you my story, and I'm already
fired.

294
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,088
Just leave if you don't want to end up in
jail.

295
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:05,646
You ungrateful bastard!

296
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:12,686
Drugs are the worst you guys.

297
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:19,193
They are putting up grass!

298
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:21,429
They'll plant a lawn.

299
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:30,970
There, a row of trees, a playground here.

300
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:34,685
They used to bring the police squad.

301
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:36,585
Now they bring recreation squad. How
about it?

302
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:42,782
Democracy Bro. Democracy is here!

303
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:50,531
Hi! What are you young men up to?

304
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:59,398
Us? We're just waiting for the grass to
grow.

305
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:06,150
We want to know what young people think.

306
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,419
We're putting in some green areas,

307
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:10,910
some playgrounds... etc.

308
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:18,662
Nice can you imagine? All green.

309
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:21,723
All you can do here is get bored.

310
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:27,903
Sometimes we attempt to amuse
ourselves... foolishly.

311
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:33,067
Drink some beers, take some speed.

312
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:41,610
And end up pretty fucked up. Right?

313
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:46,524
Would you have another question?

314
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:50,661
Listen guy! I smoked some grass too in my
day.

315
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:55,621
We all have problems. We must work them
out.

316
00:38:56,701 --> 00:39:01,072
We've been forgotten all this time and now
ah?

317
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:03,632
City Hall has an excellent disposition.

318
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:08,176
Want you to know you have a friend there.

319
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:12,713
OK! Good afternoon.

320
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:23,986
You had so much time and now, you
remember the crazies.

321
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:27,223
Now that we've gone crazy...

322
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:16,177
I thought you were coming tomorrow...

323
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:22,111
can leave if you want...

324
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:37,063
What have you been up to?

325
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:42,230
Being good... as always.

326
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:49,135
It shows. You look good.

327
00:40:57,087 --> 00:40:58,554
I'm changing everything.

328
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,823
I want a total revolution.

329
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:09,632
Here, a little present.

330
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:19,175
What a beast!

331
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,475
Let's go...

332
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:43,297
Come in.

333
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:45,358
One hour, Bro.

334
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:47,160
Come in,

335
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:57,373
Try this on.

336
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:27,604
It's a bit big. Try another. A tighter one.

337
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:03,411
Are you getting hairier or what?

338
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:07,214
Nah... as always.

339
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:11,520
Well, It's been quite a while since I saw
you...

340
00:43:21,465 --> 00:43:25,834
No, no, no! Let's stop this game

341
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:28,529
The last time...

342
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:46,055
Hey you! Going out again? Where are you
going?

343
00:43:51,495 --> 00:43:54,589
Remember it's you sister's birthday
tomorrow.

344
00:43:57,534 --> 00:43:59,263
Yes? How many?

345
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:05,898
I don't know, 27 or 28.I can't remember.

346
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:16,310
Don't give me that angelic look... You could
almost fool me.

347
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:22,848
I heard the number you and friends pulled
the other day.

348
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:28,754
I've told you. If someone comes offering
stuff...

349
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:31,824
We say: "Yes" you hear?

350
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:35,194
If they offer grass. Then it's grass we
want...

351
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:40,099
Bicycles? Lt' bicycles we want...

352
00:44:40,544 --> 00:44:43,604
Yugoss? It's Yugos we want...

353
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:48,245
We don't have to be stupid...

354
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,256
How long are you going to be begging?

355
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,126
It's better than nothing,

356
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:01,688
You don't get it, do you?

357
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:13,275
We could count blocks...

358
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,815
Let's count blocks all night long...

359
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:19,612
I no longer sleep.

360
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:24,783
And this is... a "pelusa"...

361
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:28,887
OK champ, catch me.

362
00:45:30,627 --> 00:45:32,891
I spoke and we were stuck.

363
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:37,492
I've got you!

364
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:40,796
And, the dwarfs!

365
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:45,776
The dwarfs are going to got us...

366
00:45:45,776 --> 00:45:47,073
And Me?

367
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:49,213
And you.

368
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:50,339
Be serious! Loco.

369
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,745
I have a toothache. Loco!

370
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,716
Hey! I've got you!

371
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:00,546
Me, five hundred and twelve...

372
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:05,418
You, four hundred and six...

373
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:10,191
Something is loose. You're dumber than
usual...

374
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:23,111
My tooth is bursting loco. My tooth Loco!

375
00:46:30,654 --> 00:46:32,588
What did you do with the money I gave you
asshole?

376
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:37,086
Drugs are the worst! The worst!

377
00:46:42,266 --> 00:46:44,131
And now the fucker complains...

378
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,515
I've got a mission here...

379
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:13,460
There she is. The same star she tells me.

380
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:17,159
I've got a mission to fulfill in this world.

381
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:23,097
The future is ours guy.

382
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,071
What future guy?

383
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:40,588
The other day this gypsy looked at my
hand...

384
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:48,663
She looked at me and she started laughing
like crazy.

385
00:47:52,135 --> 00:47:54,262
Must've been your filthy hands...

386
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:29,133
So, everything is clear.
Can I count on you?

387
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,005
You know we never fail.

388
00:48:35,178 --> 00:48:37,476
That's what we are here for. Right?

389
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:39,850
So it's the same deal. If you are caught,

390
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:42,011
I'll claim you stole my car, OK?

391
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:45,451
If we fuck up... we are fucked.

392
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:51,560
Nobody loves me!

393
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:55,966
The world is so cruel!

394
00:48:55,966 --> 00:48:58,093
I'm so ugly!

395
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:09,202
Cut it out! Feto.

396
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,575
We are almost there!!

397
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:17,008
Hey! What if the police stops us?

398
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:20,746
Are you crazy? They don't stop this kind of
car...

399
00:49:51,121 --> 00:49:55,057
To think we've got 4000 Km. Of shoreline

400
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:57,385
The whole sea.

401
00:50:05,235 --> 00:50:11,367
Right here bro... Here every day! Shit!

402
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:17,947
And we, stuck in the world's driest spot...

403
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:23,186
It's just not right...

404
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:27,756
I'd rather be bored here

405
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:30,721
than going crazy in that dump.

406
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:32,482
Hello!

407
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:36,886
Hello!

408
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:44,892
So. What do you want?

409
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:48,060
Don't remember me?

410
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:55,776
Oh... Yes. Mr. Gustavito sends you...

411
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:24,498
Here it is. Tell Mr. Gustavito its grade A,

412
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:29,736
Last night, we went wild...

413
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:32,981
It's a present for Mr. Gustavito

414
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:34,451
Please take him these avocados.

415
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:35,884
In your name, Lady.

416
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:39,011
OK. My friend, have a good trip.

417
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:40,579
Take it easy.

418
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:51,133
Not bad? Don Pedro seems to like us. Well
done!

419
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:52,998
Take some if you want.

420
00:52:57,607 --> 00:53:02,067
Check Nacho out! It's ok. It's ok.

421
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:08,713
Good work!

422
00:53:11,955 --> 00:53:13,923
You can stay if you want to.

423
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:16,356
We can smoke something, drink
something... OK?

424
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:18,752
Sure thing!

425
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,632
Manuela.

426
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:06,634
What a beautiful fish!

427
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:11,981
So it's a fish!

428
00:54:13,783 --> 00:54:16,377
Nice.

429
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:25,324
Please stand there. Ah!

430
00:54:30,133 --> 00:54:33,068
You look so beautiful!

431
00:54:43,513 --> 00:54:45,572
Don't you remember me?

432
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:50,080
Sorry, what's going on?

433
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:58,152
What's this? A good luck charm?

434
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:08,332
This is a tool

435
00:55:18,114 --> 00:55:19,672
Can I tell you a secret?

436
00:55:22,018 --> 00:55:23,576
If you want to.

437
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:33,754
I know you. I've known you for a long time.

438
00:55:39,235 --> 00:55:42,762
Yes? That's nice.

439
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:13,203
Don't you remember those dawns by the
river?

440
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:15,671
Where you and I would bathe,

441
00:56:16,339 --> 00:56:20,105
among those gray hippies

442
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:24,573
You are quite crazy... ah?

443
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:36,951
But it wasn't in this lifetime. It was
thousands of years ago.

444
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:45,092
I was a princess and you a fisherman.

445
00:56:47,637 --> 00:56:52,597
I would stare at you as you sailed through
the river.

446
00:56:56,179 --> 00:56:58,238
One day you looked at me.

447
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:08,887
And we promised ourselves eternal love.

448
00:57:13,463 --> 00:57:15,294
Do you remember now?

449
00:57:54,337 --> 00:57:56,202
Cheers! Mom.

450
00:57:59,576 --> 00:58:00,702
What's going on?

451
00:58:01,377 --> 00:58:03,174
I brought some pisco for us to drink.

452
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:06,575
What time is it?

453
00:58:18,428 --> 00:58:22,125
I bet you never thought I was once
a great lover.

454
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:29,765
Lover? Marijuana lover maybe.
I can smell it.

455
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:44,346
This is nice

456
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:49,553
Really nice.

457
00:58:52,195 --> 00:59:00,159
Well now I had such a strange dream...

458
00:59:01,804 --> 00:59:03,738
a nice dream.

459
00:59:05,942 --> 00:59:10,379
There was this guy,

460
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:14,038
I think he was coming for me.

461
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:21,291
Yes, he was coming for me.

462
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:24,260
He told me so.

463
00:59:26,763 --> 00:59:30,699
And he started kissing me.

464
00:59:34,437 --> 00:59:36,928
I didn't know what to do.

465
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:39,437
But I liked it.

466
00:59:45,848 --> 00:59:50,182
He told me we'd meet in another lifetime

467
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:55,490
we'd meet in another lifetime

468
00:59:59,562 --> 01:00:01,860
and he was coming for me...

469
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:06,496
I don't know where, but he was taking me.

470
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:15,404
And?

471
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:22,615
Then you arrived, and fucked
my dream up!

472
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:29,084
Is your hair wet?

473
01:00:29,993 --> 01:00:31,460
I was swimming.

474
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:36,523
You were swimming...

475
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:46,201
Here, buy yourself a present.

476
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:53,582
What did you do?

477
01:00:55,218 --> 01:00:56,776
Don't make any questions lady.

478
01:00:58,955 --> 01:01:00,752
You didn't mug anybody.

479
01:01:01,557 --> 01:01:03,889
It was just grass, joints.

480
01:01:09,532 --> 01:01:11,693
Well OK. If it's only joints.

481
01:01:13,603 --> 01:01:15,872
I'm talking, a big party.

482
01:01:15,872 --> 01:01:19,308
On this side, booze! I mean BOOZE Bro.

483
01:01:19,308 --> 01:01:21,344
On this other side: Chicks man.

484
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:22,912
And there we were. Fooling around.

485
01:01:22,912 --> 01:01:25,281
The girls were kind of stoned,

486
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:27,613
So we talked to them and shit...

487
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:30,019
We made plans to get together.

488
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:33,284
They wanted to know how we scored
the grass...

489
01:01:34,424 --> 01:01:37,086
All of sudden... in the middle of this...

490
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:39,495
I see fucking Niki having a ball

491
01:01:39,495 --> 01:01:41,326
The fucker goes out to the terrace

492
01:01:41,397 --> 01:01:48,132
And there's this huge pool.

493
01:01:49,906 --> 01:01:53,137
The motherfucker has this
incredible chick with him.

494
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:54,811
What a chick!

495
01:01:58,748 --> 01:02:00,181
This is good.

496
01:02:00,783 --> 01:02:02,444
Make it roll!

497
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:22,437
I need guys that can handle it.

498
01:02:23,873 --> 01:02:25,431
That's what we are here for.

499
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:31,470
This trip is north

500
01:02:32,815 --> 01:02:34,806
This shit is heavy.

501
01:02:36,018 --> 01:02:37,383
You mean it's dangerous?

502
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:43,956
What's with you mate?

503
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:46,262
There's nothing for free in life.

504
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:47,627
Or do people give you things?

505
01:02:55,204 --> 01:02:57,468
Why don't you uncurl you hair jerk!

506
01:03:01,744 --> 01:03:04,406
You can't imagine the amount money you'll
make.

507
01:03:46,856 --> 01:03:48,323
Hi!

508
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,627
Hi!

509
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:59,225
What happened the other night
was beautiful!

510
01:04:03,739 --> 01:04:05,730
Yes, it was nice.

511
01:04:09,612 --> 01:04:15,710
A trip. Sometimes I go crazy.

512
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:28,352
Let's talk another time
I haven't slept a wink.

513
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,061
So, a crazy trip!

514
01:04:39,141 --> 01:04:44,101
Such is life; each one is into his own trip...

515
01:04:48,284 --> 01:04:50,309
You better go...

516
01:04:53,522 --> 01:04:56,082
You knew? I hate to be
played around with...

517
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:00,329
Bitch!

518
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:01,864
Get lost!

519
01:05:01,864 --> 01:05:03,491
Asshole!

520
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:34,755
Onyx, Duot, Tritium, Quatrix,, Fivcola,
Soxtot, Soptrium.

521
01:05:35,564 --> 01:05:36,826
Fucking A!

522
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:44,433
Everything ok?

523
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:46,169
Sure!

524
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:19,730
Let's stop this shit Bro.
We are totally wired!

525
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:25,136
Niki! Rorro is looking for you.

526
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:32,944
And what are you up to. So neat...

527
01:06:33,022 --> 01:06:35,991
You would think you bathed.

528
01:06:36,592 --> 01:06:37,957
We are leaving.

529
01:06:40,062 --> 01:06:41,586
What do you mean?

530
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:43,290
We are leaving.

531
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,363
We are going north.

532
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:52,497
But they are fixing the place up...

533
01:06:52,575 --> 01:06:54,839
There'll be plenty to do.

534
01:06:56,812 --> 01:06:58,404
I hope so.

535
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:02,784
It seems we'll be there. W e want to have
him up north...

536
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:05,521
Right, Rorro?

537
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:06,852
Sure,

538
01:07:07,623 --> 01:07:09,614
Clean slate.

539
01:07:22,171 --> 01:07:26,665
Hey! Don't spend it all... Leave some for the
north OK?

540
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:32,104
Listen I'm in the business to make money.

541
01:07:32,181 --> 01:07:33,739
Not to front money. Dig?

542
01:07:35,451 --> 01:07:37,919
Some kind of businessman.

543
01:07:38,754 --> 01:07:43,191
Guy... To make money, you've got to front
money.

544
01:07:43,759 --> 01:07:47,217
It's the market economy.

545
01:07:47,296 --> 01:07:50,754
You mean in the country or sharks,
the sharks win...

546
01:07:52,134 --> 01:07:56,230
And what do you want wimps to win?

547
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:20,488
Hey you! I told you Rorro
was looking for you.

548
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:25,700
Tell him I'm coming.

549
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:33,564
What are you two up to?
You seem so edgy.

550
01:08:36,912 --> 01:08:40,040
Nothing, what are you doing in my room?

551
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:43,347
Why don't split. It's my room after all.

552
01:08:48,023 --> 01:08:52,595
You know what, I'm going to tell on you

553
01:08:52,595 --> 01:08:54,460
I'll turn you in.

554
01:08:56,398 --> 01:08:59,299
What's the big deal? After all I'm the
moneymaker.

555
01:09:00,936 --> 01:09:02,028
You want money?

556
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:06,399
Here. Take some.

557
01:09:08,777 --> 01:09:11,268
Buy some lunch.

558
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:32,468
The first rule in this is.

559
01:09:32,468 --> 01:09:34,868
Be clean and know nothing.

560
01:09:35,538 --> 01:09:37,130
I'll say it again. This is big stuff.

561
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:41,171
Any mess up and we are all fucked.

562
01:09:41,243 --> 01:09:43,677
When you've got to go, you go.

563
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:47,346
And when are we leaving?

564
01:09:47,816 --> 01:09:48,908
Yesterday!

565
01:09:56,425 --> 01:10:00,486
Front up some money, not like last time.

566
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:03,661
How old are you?

567
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:07,462
23

568
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:12,299
23 and what are you up to?

569
01:10:14,743 --> 01:10:16,870
Up to here in dust, man.

570
01:10:19,281 --> 01:10:20,680
So that's it, hum...

571
01:10:21,784 --> 01:10:23,012
That's it.

572
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:27,112
And you want out?

573
01:10:29,758 --> 01:10:31,089
Sure thing.

574
01:10:31,961 --> 01:10:33,053
So...

575
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:38,790
The north awaits you kid.

576
01:10:52,381 --> 01:10:54,781
Life or death.

577
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:58,083
We're talking big money Bro.

578
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:06,885
Fucking red alert, no fuck-ups.

579
01:11:11,634 --> 01:11:20,565
I at least will grab the money,
grab the old lady and split.

580
01:11:22,211 --> 01:11:25,881
We'll give the guys some plant,
a huge lawn...

581
01:11:25,881 --> 01:11:29,084
Shit, a fucking swimming pool

582
01:11:29,084 --> 01:11:33,077
With our name on a plate
so they wont forget us.

583
01:11:35,991 --> 01:11:39,017
Candy or spice?

584
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:45,430
Candy.

585
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:50,764
Life or death?

586
01:11:58,247 --> 01:12:00,408
Life, always life.

587
01:12:04,353 --> 01:12:08,722
A voice of alert, arms in the evening...

588
01:12:09,258 --> 01:12:13,456
Arms at night. Nothing to fear...

589
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:28,601
Candy or spice

590
01:12:30,412 --> 01:12:32,039
Spice!

591
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:36,916
Heaven or Earth?

592
01:12:40,389 --> 01:12:41,856
Earth!

593
01:12:43,625 --> 01:12:46,492
Life or death?

594
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:50,097
Hey, what's your game?

595
01:12:52,801 --> 01:12:56,999
Walking blindly by the abyss.

596
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:04,310
Quickly obeying a destiny.

597
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:17,490
It's that crazy chick again.

598
01:13:18,994 --> 01:13:20,791
I have already forgiven you...

599
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:46,877
Walking blindly by the abyss.

600
01:13:47,956 --> 01:13:53,656
Quickly obeying a destiny.

601
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:04,663
Your move.

602
01:14:10,379 --> 01:14:12,108
You've got me.

603
01:14:14,416 --> 01:14:15,508
Again...

604
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:27,128
Let's play one more.

605
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:46,682
Pilot approaching runaway.

606
01:14:46,682 --> 01:14:49,810
Centaury space ship ready to take of f.

607
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:00,125
Over Cholica I...

608
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:37,432
Game over shit head.

609
01:15:37,432 --> 01:15:38,592
Hey! Be cool.

610
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:40,100
I'll show you jerk!

611
01:15:40,435 --> 01:15:41,663
Come, asshole!

612
01:15:42,771 --> 01:15:44,432
Catch him!

613
01:16:22,344 --> 01:16:27,304
Don't move man, you may die.

614
01:16:36,725 --> 01:16:38,659
Nacho, Bro!

615
01:16:39,061 --> 01:16:40,221
Nacho...

616
01:18:34,009 --> 01:18:35,704
Niki!

617
01:18:37,779 --> 01:18:39,474
Niki!

618
01:18:43,085 --> 01:18:44,780
Niki!

619
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:54,726
I would've liked to be a sailor.

620
01:18:57,032 --> 01:19:00,058
Well now I sail the desert.

621
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:55,849
My God! We are all alone in the desert,
no one to save us.

622
01:20:03,532 --> 01:20:08,492
Poor things, no one to save us...

623
01:20:51,746 --> 01:20:55,648
Liqui Molly, Sweetheart!

624
01:21:00,455 --> 01:21:02,582
Occasionally she got moody...

625
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:11,927
What brings you here?

626
01:21:17,339 --> 01:21:19,637
We are studying the ozone layer...

627
01:21:20,308 --> 01:21:21,900
In the desert...

628
01:21:33,521 --> 01:21:34,920
It's all fate.

629
01:21:56,444 --> 01:21:57,672
You got a cigarette?

630
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:53,629
What's up?

631
01:22:55,870 --> 01:22:57,337
Witch way is it?

632
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:05,746
Candy or spice?

633
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:14,044
Or you want to go back?

634
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:41,111
Playing cards on the wall fuckers...

635
01:23:43,818 --> 01:23:45,581
Lockers to the right...

636
01:23:48,223 --> 01:23:49,713
This is it!

637
01:24:47,382 --> 01:24:48,940
What's going on?

638
01:24:51,619 --> 01:24:52,745
What are you doing there?

639
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:55,412
Nothing, be cool!

640
01:24:56,157 --> 01:24:57,385
What are you doing? Answer!

641
01:25:16,311 --> 01:25:19,439
This kid has got to learn.

642
01:25:22,517 --> 01:25:28,752
In this desert we're the bosses!

643
01:25:39,334 --> 01:25:40,733
Are you ok?

644
01:25:41,636 --> 01:25:42,898
He's ok.

645
01:25:45,607 --> 01:25:48,906
You've got what you wanted;
now you can go.

646
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:41,618
And?

647
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:43,497
There was no answer.

648
01:26:46,301 --> 01:26:47,791
What's today?

649
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:49,067
Thursday.

650
01:26:50,572 --> 01:26:53,336
He told me to call today at this time.

651
01:27:56,070 --> 01:27:56,838
Who is it?

652
01:27:56,838 --> 01:27:57,896
Delivery,

653
01:28:00,608 --> 01:28:01,836
to uncle.

654
01:28:03,378 --> 01:28:04,436
One moment.

655
01:28:34,742 --> 01:28:36,835
So, no problems, everything ok?

656
01:28:39,013 --> 01:28:41,481
No problem, beautiful trip.

657
01:28:48,022 --> 01:28:49,614
Let's see the package.

658
01:28:51,626 --> 01:28:53,685
The money first, it's five bills.

659
01:28:58,366 --> 01:28:59,560
What do you mean five bills?

660
01:29:00,802 --> 01:29:03,134
The deal was with you and Nacho.
He's out

661
01:29:03,604 --> 01:29:04,798
So it's half.

662
01:29:06,974 --> 01:29:11,138
Same deal. Five bills.

663
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:17,645
Check out this asshole. Shit!

664
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:23,022
OK! So go get the stuff.

665
01:29:25,026 --> 01:29:26,220
The money first.

666
01:29:28,463 --> 01:29:29,521
Shit!

667
01:29:58,292 --> 01:29:59,384
Let's make it now.

668
01:30:01,028 --> 01:30:02,290
Let's go!

669
01:30:03,731 --> 01:30:05,096
Hold it! Don't move!

670
01:30:13,307 --> 01:30:14,501
Take cover!

671
01:30:23,684 --> 01:30:24,514
Let's go!

672
01:30:28,289 --> 01:30:30,780
Stop, stop asshole! Stop!

673
01:31:41,262 --> 01:31:42,923
Wake up son of a bitch!

674
01:31:47,835 --> 01:31:49,234
Wake up you creeps!

675
01:32:08,322 --> 01:32:09,983
Niki is here!

676
01:32:21,636 --> 01:32:24,764
Here you creeps,
Nacho sends you this shit!

677
01:32:41,589 --> 01:32:43,216
Let's go! Everything's ok.

678
01:33:10,651 --> 01:33:14,678
Walking blindly by the abyss...

679
01:33:18,059 --> 01:33:26,125
Where ever you might be... If you
remember us...

680
01:35:00,127 --> 01:35:07,158
And they called there days,
Monday, Tuesday,

681
01:35:08,636 --> 01:35:10,001
Wednesday...

682
01:35:22,483 --> 01:35:24,985
They say the street will take care of you...

683
01:35:24,985 --> 01:35:26,887
But they'll crack your skull every time.

684
01:35:26,887 --> 01:35:29,082
So everybody has a blade.

685
01:36:04,525 --> 01:36:07,294
CHOLICA I, THE PLANET CALLING...

686
01:36:07,294 --> 01:36:08,761
CHOLICA I, HERE WE ARE...

687
01:36:09,463 --> 01:36:10,691
GREETINGS.
