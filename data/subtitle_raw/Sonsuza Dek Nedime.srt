1
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,600
Cemre.

2
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,040
Cemre!

3
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,040
- Cemre.
- Yeah? I'm here.

4
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,440
Yes? What's up?

5
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,800
Did you change our dance song?

6
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,840
Oh, that? Yeah, honey. Don't worry.

7
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,920
- Cool.
- Of course.

8
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,880
Who changes their song every half an hour?

9
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,160
- Hey, Tuna.
- I'm here.

10
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,160
- What's up?
- Hand me a banana, babe.

11
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,880
I think you should stop eating.

12
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,760
Listen, honey.

13
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,760
The playlist, the seating, the food…
I'm handling them all.

14
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,840
- Don't worry, okay?
- Thank you so much, honey.

15
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,120
- I'm so nervous.
- Look at your hair.

16
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,760
Let it go. I'm going to do a bun too.

17
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,120
- It's your hair.
- Come on.

18
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,360
Where's Leyla?

19
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,640
Who knows?
I'm sure she's after some free stuff.

20
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,280
Not that anyone would take her seriously
in that costume.

21
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,280
- What's wrong with our costumes?
- Pose.

22
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,440
Hang on.

23
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,560
There we go. That's it.

24
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,840
Oh, Gulliver's here.

25
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,360
I'd never think I'd agree with you,
you pain in the ass,

26
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,120
but the bartender
laughed at me for minutes.

27
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,200
He laughed at <i>me!</i>

28
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,200
This is supposed to be
just the time for scoring guys,

29
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,880
but we have zero chance like this.

30
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,640
So you're bringing your chances
from zero to one with those glasses?

31
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,360
Girl, I don't need chances.
I'm fighting for Cemre.

32
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,440
What?

33
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,160
Just so you know,
the bartender's really hot.

34
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,320
- My eyes are bleeding just looking at you.
- Don't mind her, Cemre.

35
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,920
Mete's a suitable candidate. I like him.

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,920
Yeah. I totally agree.

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,760
He's handsome, smart,
sophisticated, and rich.

38
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,560
You know, I think he's going to propose!

39
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,560
What?

40
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,720
When?

41
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,240
Did you see the ring? Was it big?

42
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,960
He's cheap, though.
He probably bought a fake.

43
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,800
Let's have a jeweler check it.

44
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,080
- Shut up.
- Mete's no good.

45
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,320
I've been telling you that
for eight years.

46
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,920
Eight years!

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,840
- Think about the bartender.
- No.

48
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,720
- But not in that costume.
- Come on.

49
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,840
- You go get the bartender, then.
- Yeah. Go ahead.

50
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:53,360
But I don't want to get married.
We're fine the way we are with Emir.

51
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,160
I'm sure you are.

52
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,360
You know, since the guy
saw you three times in total.

53
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,040
He'd run away if he spent a week with you.

54
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,400
- As if you're doing any better.
- I'm doing perfectly fine.

55
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,000
Stop arguing already.
We're almost ready to go here.

56
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,240
- Tuna, the shoe and the pen.
- Okay. Got it.

57
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,360
- Here you go.
- Oh, I know.

58
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,760
Add my baby's name too.

59
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,160
Sure. Let's get it
its wedding present too.

60
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,080
- Cemre...
- Give it here.

61
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,680
- She took it.
- Go ahead, honey.

62
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,200
Put yours in capital letters
right in the middle.

63
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,120
I hope you get married soon
so we can have some peace.

64
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,360
I swear I'll stab you with the heel, Tuna.
Just shut up.

65
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,520
I'm adding yours in the corner
with tiny letters.

66
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,040
But it's so small.

67
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,960
You don't even want to get married.
Why is mine so small?

68
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,800
See that small speck? That's you.

69
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,960
- Give it to me!
- No, I'm doing it.

70
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,360
- Come on! Hand it over!
- Let it go! Come on!

71
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,560
You're going to tear it apart!

72
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,560
- Let it go!
- Let me have it!

73
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,360
Tuna!

74
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,520
It was her, Cemre. I swear.

75
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,760
You hexed me, Tuna.

76
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,080
Listen. I swear I'll hold you accountable
if Mete doesn't propose.

77
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,040
I'll kill you!

78
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,720
Come on. Don't be like that.
Let's stay positive.

79
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,240
- You brought me seven years of bad luck.
- Don't be ridiculous.

80
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,200
Shall I take a picture of you?
What do you say?

81
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,080
Look at you all dolled up.
Forget the superstition.

82
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,520
- Come on, girls.
- Let's go.

83
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,640
- Wow! Come on.
- Come on.

84
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,040
- We don't have a single picture together.
- You're all so pretty. Beautiful.

85
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,200
Look at you! Oh, come on already, Cemre.

86
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,320
It's not the end of the world.

87
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,720
Yeah, man.

88
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,120
Where are you, Mete?

89
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,600
Hey, baby.

90
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,440
Hey. Who do you think
is going to catch the bouquet?

91
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,600
I'm betting on Leyla. A hundred bucks.

92
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,200
No way. Cemre's here.

93
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,280
- I'm thinking Cemre too.
- Oh, yeah?

94
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,520
Let's hope so, then. Let's go.

95
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,440
- Hold that. Come on.
- Do try, though.

96
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,200
- Let's go.
- Come on.

97
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,520
I'm here!

98
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,680
Throw it!

99
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,440
- Three, two…
- This is my favorite part.

100
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,840
One…

101
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,240
Come on.

102
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,880
- Do it.
- Come on already.

103
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,200
I caught it! I did it!

104
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,680
- There we go.
- I got it.

105
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,760
Nice.

106
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,560
Mete?

107
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,560
He's here. He's going to propose!

108
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,760
Yes!

109
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,080
Yes.

110
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,080
I mean… Yes, I'm listening.
I'm Cemre. What's up?

111
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
Cemre.

112
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,280
I wasn't planning on doing it here,
but I can't wait any longer.

113
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,360
Cemre.

114
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,280
I can't do this anymore.

115
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,880
I'm sorry.

116
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,960
I can't be in this relationship anymore.

117
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,560
I'll come get my stuff sometime, okay?
Don't throw them out.

118
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,200
<i>Cemre.</i>

119
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,200
<i>I can't do this anymore.</i>

120
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,280
<i>I can't be in this relationship anymore.</i>

121
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,120
<i>I'll come get my stuff sometime, okay?
Don't throw them out.</i>

122
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,920
Why did this have to happen?

123
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,800
I can't spend eight more years
for someone else now!

124
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,000
Shame on you people too.

125
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,600
Shame on you
for throwing this bouquet to me!

126
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,640
Honey, please stop crying.
There's plenty of fish in the sea.

127
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,160
You're an educated,
strong, beautiful woman.

128
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,720
You'll find someone else.

129
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,360
Even if you don't, it's fine.
You don't need a man.

130
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,920
- Yeah.
- It's not a necessity.

131
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,040
But why? We were going to get married.

132
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,560
Everything was fine.
I bet there's someone else.

133
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,760
What else could it be?

134
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,120
- Oh, come on!
- No way.

135
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,400
- Come on, honey.
- Yeah.

136
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,840
The mirror! It's because of you.

137
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,200
You cursed me!

138
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,400
I'm going to be a spinster because of you.

139
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,240
I'm blocking him on everything.

140
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,960
- Do it.
- You'll regret it, Cemre.

141
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,040
- Shut up.
- Do it.

142
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,640
If my honeymoon blows up on my face
because of that dumb-ass,

143
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,680
I swear I'll tear him a new one.

144
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,960
It already did, man.

145
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,480
Remember our wedding

146
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,880
when he didn't show up,
so Cemre was bawling,

147
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,080
so the girls stayed at our place,
so you and I slept on the couch?

148
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,720
Don't remind me, bro. Just don't.

149
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,480
Look at him. Look.

150
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,560
"Diving is important, Cemre!"

151
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,480
I'm scared of the sea, man.

152
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,840
"Let's climb the Everest, Cemre!"
I can't even live on the second floor.

153
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,200
Mete! It's Mete! I bet he's sorry.

154
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,680
- I'll get it.
- Cemre, stop.

155
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,600
- Don't.
- Why?

156
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,320
- Stop. Where are you going?
- Why? Shall I freshen up?

157
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,000
Leyla, you go get it.

158
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,680
- Go.
- What? Why me?

159
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,920
Leyla!

160
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,520
Let's not get judgmental.
Everyone makes mistakes.

161
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,480
- Yeah.
- Oh, honey!

162
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,000
We'll do our honeymoon
after they make up, right?

163
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,400
Is this the right time for that?

164
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,080
It's still ringing. I know that ring.
He just can't give up on me.

165
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,040
- It's Mete, and I'm getting married.
- No. Stop.

166
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,400
- Leyla, come on.
- Sinan!

167
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,200
- Let's go. Give me that.
- What's going on?

168
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,720
- Stop.
- Guys, we all need to leave.

169
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,640
- Come on.
- No.

170
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,080
- What are you up to?
- I'll explain. Ozan, help.

171
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,440
- Of course. Come on, people.
- Let's go.

172
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,320
- What's going on?
- Let's leave.

173
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,520
- You too, honey. Get her dress.
- All right.

174
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,200
Come along.
It's best to keep visits short, honey.

175
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,400
- Come on.
- What's up?

176
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,400
I realized I couldn't be without you
this past month.

177
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:49,080
Wherever I am,
I want you to be at my side.

178
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,760
Leyla, will you marry me?

179
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,480
Emir?

180
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,160
Cemre?

181
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,320
Honey, what's going on? Are you all right?

182
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,800
Leyla.

183
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,160
I realized I couldn't be without you
this past month.

184
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,720
Wherever I am,
I want you to be at my side.

185
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,920
Leyla.

186
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,680
Will you marry me?

187
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,280
Yes!

188
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,720
- Yes?
- Yes?

189
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,000
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes?

190
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,080
Yes?

191
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,840
You said yes?

192
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,040
Yes!

193
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,440
Baby!

194
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,400
I'm in shock.

195
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,200
Your hand.

196
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,120
Let me see. It looks beautiful.

197
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,360
You look beautiful.

198
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,760
Let me look at you. You're so pretty.

199
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,000
- I missed you so much, honey.
- Me too.

200
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,720
Bro.

201
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,840
I couldn't have done this
without you. Thanks.

202
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,720
- Without you?
- What?

203
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,960
Well, his flight was delayed,
so he couldn't make it to the wedding.

204
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,280
I invited him
so he'd have a place to stay.

205
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,360
- How was I supposed to know, honey?
- Shut up, Sinan.

206
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,000
All right, then. If everything's okay,
our honeymoon awaits, honey!

207
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,760
- Are we going?
- Oh, no.

208
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,680
- Melis?
- Is it time?

209
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,480
- What's going on?
- Is it happening?

210
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,920
- Hold her!
- Sinan!

211
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,680
- Be careful.
- Where's my van?

212
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,320
- Where is it?
- Where's my van?

213
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,400
- How would I know?
- They must be near.

214
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,840
- Careful.
- Let's go. Hold her.

215
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,320
- Here!
- Where?

216
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,400
- Come on!
- Let's go.

217
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,280
Why are we going to the van?

218
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,920
- Bring it around!
- Stay calm.

219
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,120
- Is it far?
- The door.

220
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,720
- It won't open.
- I got her.

221
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,320
- Hold her.
- What's going on?

222
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,680
Get in, honey.

223
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,480
Calm down.

224
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,920
This is important to us.

225
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,880
- Where are you going?
- Come on, honey!

226
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,080
Where are you going?

227
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,520
It's happening. Step on it.
The baby's coming.

228
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,080
I'm so excited! My friend's in labor!

229
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,520
See? It's kicking. What a rascal.

230
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,200
- Sinan?
- Ozan, go faster. Hurry up.

231
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,360
- Sinan, Melis is not here.
- What?

232
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,720
Melis? Melis is not here!

233
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,840
- What?
- Honey, Melis is not here!

234
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,000
- What?
- Ozan, where's Melis?

235
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,960
How would I know? Emir had her.

236
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,720
- Did you leave your wife?
- I trusted him with her!

237
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,560
Don't be stupid, man.

238
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,240
I wasn't carrying her alone.
It's not my fault.

239
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,000
- Did you run her over?
- Turn around.

240
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,400
Don't be stupid.
My husband's not a murderer.

241
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,280
I'm going to prison
instead of going on my honeymoon.

242
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,160
Screw you all. You left her there.

243
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,760
Let's just turn around.

244
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,400
- We just left her here.
- Get the door.

245
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,200
- Why is the band here?
- How could you do this, man?

246
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,520
- We'll talk afterwards.
- Emir, help us.

247
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,240
- Easy.
- Is she okay?

248
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,720
- Melis, breathe.
- Breathe, honey.

249
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,280
- Breathe.
- Hold me.

250
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,640
You found just the day for a false alarm.

251
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,560
Come on. As long as the baby's okay.

252
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,400
Honey, the baby's okay.
Is it time for us to do the deed yet?

253
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,080
Honey, you're being obnoxious.

254
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,640
Well, then. We have some news for you.

255
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,880
- You're not pregnant, are you?
- Leyla?

256
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,040
Don't be ridiculous.

257
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:40,320
You know, since everyone's already here
and in one piece,

258
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,800
we figured we'd get married right away.

259
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,400
- What? Come on!
- Oh, you.

260
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,680
Cemre, I know today was tough on you.
If you want...

261
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,200
No, on the contrary.
I think it'd do me good too, honey.

262
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,160
Not that I'd ever think you'd get married.

263
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,880
Guys, you know this is
about the shoe, right?

264
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,680
She's getting married
because I put her name there.

265
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,680
I'm putting your name and your name only
this time, Cemre.

266
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,200
We figured we'd have the wedding
on Emir's family's ranch.

267
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,440
Honey, we'll be happy with it
as long as you're happy.

268
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,120
But we need to hurry up
if we want to do this before the birth

269
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,480
because the baby definitely wants out.

270
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,880
It feels horrible
sending you off all alone.

271
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,320
Don't be ridiculous.

272
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,920
I want tons of pictures
from the dress rehearsal, okay?

273
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,600
Sinem, hold down the fort while I'm gone.

274
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,080
Leyla, move.

275
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,320
Don't worry, babe.

276
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,600
The invitation samples came in today.

277
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,600
We'll be done with our first item
by this afternoon.

278
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,760
Good. Since everyone knows their task,
I should head out.

279
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,000
- Okay.
- Melis.

280
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,840
- Yeah?
- Don't tire yourself out.

281
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,000
I won't. I'm going to the dry cleaner's
this afternoon.

282
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,840
A nice walk will be good for me.

283
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,160
Good. If everything's okay,

284
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,800
I'm leaving.

285
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,520
Hang on. The key to the ranch.

286
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,680
Sorry we're in such a rush
that you have to handle everything.

287
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,160
It's fine. I'll handle everything.
Don't worry.

288
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,400
Oh, let me know if you find my necklace.

289
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,480
- All right.
- I'll go check right now.

290
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,240
See you, then.

291
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,840
- Goodbye.
- Drive safely.

292
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,560
- See you. Kisses.
- Bye-bye.

293
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,120
Maybe we shouldn't have
left her by herself.

294
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,760
Nah. I think it's for the better.

295
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,000
Maybe being alone can help her move on.

296
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,360
You really are a weird bunch.

297
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,400
She doesn't get her stereo fixed
because it's a memento.

298
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,720
She can't forget her ex in ten days.

299
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,960
I'm so tired of your pessimism, Tuna.

300
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,680
Maybe you should've left too.
We'd have some peace.

301
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,160
Am I wrong, though?

302
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,440
God give me patience.

303
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,720
Let's go to the spa after the tasting.

304
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,400
I reserved three spots.

305
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,040
- Awesome.
- Three? What about me?

306
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,040
Tuna, I'm seriously sick of you.

307
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,920
I told you girls he'd be a pain.

308
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,760
- I'm leaving.
- Me too.

309
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,000
- Let's go get ready.
- What about me?

310
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,520
I told them not to let you in our group.

311
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,400
- You're killing me, Tuna.
- But…

312
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,200
- Leyla, please.
- Bye-bye, Tuna.

313
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,640
Eight years, man.

314
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,680
He just left me.

315
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,760
Damn it, Mete.

316
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,920
No tears.

317
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,360
Nothing can bring me down!

318
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,120
Something's bringing me down.

319
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,320
Just don't. Please.

320
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,400
What is it?

321
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,040
Why are you flat all of a sudden?

322
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,440
Here we go. The spare…

323
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,880
Mete!

324
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,160
What is this, even?

325
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,440
Damn your gear.

326
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,560
I better call the girls.

327
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,520
No reception.

328
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,720
Where even am I?

329
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,280
Come on.

330
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,240
Still nothing.

331
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,160
I'm up too high.

332
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,040
Don't look down. Just don't.
It's okay. Don't look.

333
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,880
What's up?
Are you doing a video or something?

334
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,240
Yeah. I love doing videos on top of vans
in the middle of nowhere.

335
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,040
You're tense. That won't work.

336
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,960
Dude, I'm already mad. Just leave.

337
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,360
Yeah, I can tell that from here.

338
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,000
Just so you know,
you can't change the tire from up there.

339
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,280
You need to get down.

340
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,720
Oh, really?

341
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,480
How did I not think of that?
You're so smart. Thanks.

342
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,560
Need a hand?

343
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,680
No. No, thanks.
You might be a criminal for all I know.

344
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,720
Bravo. Seriously.

345
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,480
How can you tell
without even looking at me once?

346
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,920
- I can't.
- Oh, right. Got it. Right.

347
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,240
Yeah. You're scared
you're going to fall in love right away.

348
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,800
Fair enough.

349
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,600
I'm used to it. You can look.

350
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,880
All right. Let me just help you out.

351
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,400
- Please work already.
- You can look. Here I am.

352
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,400
For God's sake.

353
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,400
Dude, I'm scared of heights.
I literally can't look.

354
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,280
I'm not wild about
checking out strange men anyway.

355
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,400
You don't even have a spare.

356
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,240
Listen. The weather's unpredictable here.

357
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,560
I can take you wherever you're going.
I'm just saying.

358
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,280
What was that?

359
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,480
- Let me go!
- All right.

360
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,000
I'm not touching you.
All right. Calm down.

361
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,560
Fine. I won't even look. All right.

362
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,800
You sure can climb down fast.

363
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,280
Look. Okay.

364
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,560
Stop being stubborn. Let me drop you off.

365
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,360
Not many people use this road.

366
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,400
Don't come near me, or I'll scream.
Just go away.

367
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,960
Go ahead and scream. Be my guest.

368
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,120
I'm sure people will run to your aid.
Give it a try.

369
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,440
You're in the middle of nowhere.
I was just being a good Samaritan.

370
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,680
Look. Let me just drop you off.

371
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,560
No. Go away.

372
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,840
Suit yourself. I can't with you anymore.

373
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,000
I'm leaving.

374
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,360
Go ahead! No one asked you to stay.

375
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,240
I wouldn't even if you asked, all right?

376
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,520
I'm not fond of cranky stranded women.
You're annoying.

377
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,920
No woman in their right mind
would ask your help.

378
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,960
Take a hike. Come on. Go.

379
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,120
Good luck.

380
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,040
Damn it, Mete!

381
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,880
What am I going to do?

382
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,240
Damn it.

383
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,960
I'm so glad we chose these cakes.
They're delicious.

384
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,520
Tuna, give Sinan a call
so he doesn't forget to bring pizza.

385
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,920
I already did. Don't worry.

386
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,200
Also, we <i>had </i>to choose those cakes
because you ate everything else they had.

387
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,960
You went through everything they offered
without any shame whatsoever.

388
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,720
- Unbelievable!
- "Unbelievable!"

389
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,880
Cemre's phone is still off, right?

390
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,760
I wonder if she's there yet.

391
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,640
It's off. The battery must've died.

392
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,320
I'm sure she's there by now.

393
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,680
Imagine it. Maybe she embarked
on the journey of her life

394
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,520
and met a hero or something.

395
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,440
In half a day? Come on.

396
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,720
Nothing.

397
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,840
I'm glad she's not here.
She can just chill all by herself.

398
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,720
- All by herself…
- Yeah.

399
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,040
Poyraz… I didn't tell her about Poyraz.

400
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,280
Who's Poyraz?

401
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,840
Here we go.

402
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,080
What's going on?

403
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,600
Who's Poyraz? Is he a guest?

404
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,360
Cemre's going to tear me a new one.

405
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,560
She's going to chop me up into pieces.

406
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,080
What? Why?

407
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,240
I hope you're not trying
to set her up with someone.

408
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,000
She got dumped just yesterday.

409
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,200
Don't be ridiculous.

410
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,080
Leyla would never even
dream of something like that.

411
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,440
She barely had any wits
which she lost at the proposal.

412
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,840
I'm losing it over here. Just tell me.

413
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:13,440
I swear, Melis, you're up to anything
except giving birth, honey.

414
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,840
Oh, come on.

415
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,440
Poyraz is Emir's cousin.

416
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,200
He lives near the ranch.

417
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,960
Emir asked his help
with the wedding preparations.

418
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,560
How nice.

419
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,080
He's just there to help.
That's a good thing.

420
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,520
She still doesn't get it.

421
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,280
Girls, I'm not
the only optimist here, right?

422
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,480
Just imagine. Cemre's a bit cold.

423
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:39,240
With his strong arms,
Poyraz chops some wood and makes a fire.

424
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,320
Such romance!

425
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:44,040
Maybe that'll help Cemre
forget about Mete and move on.

426
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,960
Yeah, right. Don't be ridiculous, man.

427
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:51,760
I blame your high-carb diet, Tuna.
You can't even think properly anymore.

428
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,840
You all are just boring.

429
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,800
- Should I give Emir a call?
- Call him.

430
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,520
All right.

431
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,960
He's not picking up.

432
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,480
What do you mean? Just text him, then.

433
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,920
I will.

434
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,320
I thought no one was at the ranch.

435
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,920
Oh, no. A burglar.

436
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,000
Let's go, Cemre.

437
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,080
You've come this far.

438
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,960
You can do it.

439
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,960
Damn…

440
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
You?

441
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,360
Are you insane, woman?
You almost cracked my head open.

442
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,920
How did you get in here?
What are you up to?

443
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,480
You're a burglar! I knew it.
I'm calling the cops.

444
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,240
- Don't you run! I'm calling them.
- Shut up already!

445
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,960
Are you Cemre?

446
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,360
You know my name? You pervert!

447
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,920
- How do you know my name?
- Emir told me.

448
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,360
I'm his cousin!

449
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,840
They asked me to come help you.

450
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,720
I'm the one who needs help, though.
Look at us.

451
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,160
- Emir?
- Yeah!

452
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,800
Emir, Leyla… Remember them?

453
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,640
Are you going to just stand there?
You look proud, even.

454
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,640
Will you at least try to help me
and get me some ice or water?

455
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,080
I'm dying over here!

456
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,480
Oh, come on. Don't be so dramatic.

457
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,600
You'll survive. Don't worry.

458
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,320
Guys, we're all just chilling here,
but we still haven't heard from Cemre.

459
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,160
Should we call the police?

460
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,040
Oh, come on, girls.
My cousin's not a murderer.

461
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,520
For God's sake.

462
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,960
I'm sure they're mingling
with each other already.

463
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,240
I mean, they must be having a chat.
Her phone probably died.

464
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,760
Just chill, please.

465
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,920
Jeez. All right. I'll call him.

466
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,920
- Yeah.
- Call him.

467
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,240
Let's put your minds at ease.

468
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,360
- We're so worried about her.
- All right, honey.

469
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,360
You're overreacting.

470
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,720
See?

471
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,160
Yeah, cousin?

472
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,960
Hello? What's up, cousin?

473
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,840
- Ask about Cemre.
- Ask him what happened.

474
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,480
- God...
- Give it to me, for God's sake.

475
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,880
- Poyraz?
- Ask about Cemre.

476
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,160
Honey, just…

477
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,480
Hey, Leyla. What's up? You okay?

478
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,520
Is it Leyla? Hey, Leyla.

479
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,720
But…

480
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,280
Yeah, I'm finally at the ranch, but…

481
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,720
What a sicko.

482
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,360
When were you planning on
telling me about this guy?

483
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,960
<i>He's there to help you.</i>

484
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,680
Help me? Why would I need help?

485
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,400
You're right, honey.
But we were so worried about you.

486
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,920
Yeah, she was <i>so </i>worried
she was setting a manicure appointment.

487
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,880
<i>I had a flat tire on the way.</i>

488
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,520
Then a maniac insisted on helping me.

489
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,440
What? Did he touch you? Scumbag!

490
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,360
He wouldn't dare.

491
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,480
But I was still so mad at Mete,
I basically cussed the guy off.

492
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,400
<i>Then it started raining.</i>

493
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,920
I arrived here
all drenched and covered in mud.

494
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
<i>- Guess what happened next.</i>
- What?

495
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,480
Oh, no! Did the scumbag follow you?

496
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,760
I noticed someone was in the house.

497
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,160
I didn't know what to do,

498
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,560
so I grabbed a log
and hit him in the head.

499
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,360
Then I realized
he was the maniac on the road.

500
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,520
Poyraz?

501
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,800
Yeah, Poyraz.

502
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,360
Cemre, did you crack his skull open?
Did you just murder him?

503
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,560
Don't be dumb.

504
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,600
Yeah. Then I made him answer the phone
so you wouldn't get suspicious.

505
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,880
Don't be stupid.

506
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,280
I'm alive.

507
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,040
For now, at least.

508
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,560
<i>Dude, what happened?</i>

509
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,960
You okay? You want us to come over?

510
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,880
I'm all right, cousin. Thanks.
Don't worry about me.

511
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,760
<i>Who cares? Cemre, are you okay?</i>

512
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,640
<i>Let us know about the progress.
Call us once in a while.</i>

513
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,440
All right. Talk to you later.

514
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,280
Here.

515
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,680
- See?
- She's fine.

516
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,760
- See, honey? Here you go.
- All right.

517
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,840
Have fun.

518
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,080
Here.

519
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,400
A shower might make more sense.

520
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,080
Oh, yeah? You're going to rub my back too?

521
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,400
Go home. Don't you have a place?

522
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,720
I sure do. It's not like
I want to stay here with you.

523
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,080
Enjoy the secluded house.

524
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,400
Off you go, then.

525
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,240
What's that noise?

526
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,120
It's so early.

527
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,840
Hello!

528
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,200
Hello! Can't you hear me?

529
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,160
I can't deal with this so early.

530
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,080
What are you doing?

531
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,920
Who told you to do this?

532
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,320
Here.

533
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,360
Good morning to you as well, Cemre.

534
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,000
Morning. So, what are you doing?

535
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,960
I'm mowing the yard for the wedding.
What's wrong?

536
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,080
You're welcome.

537
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,600
I didn't say thanks.

538
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,680
I know.

539
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,240
Why wouldn't you run it by me first?
Since I'm the wedding planner and all.

540
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,680
The wedding is in ten days.

541
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,160
We can't have the planner
waking up at 10:00.

542
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,400
All right. Okay. I was just joking.
Don't look at me like that.

543
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,800
I don't want you
mowing me down or something.

544
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,520
Here. You're in charge.
I was just helping.

545
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,200
If you're so mad about it,
you can do it yourself.

546
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,560
Are you going to be
in the way all day long?

547
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,680
I don't think you realize it,

548
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,880
but I'm the one
who should be avoiding <i>you.</i>

549
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,160
Go, then. Avoid me.
You can run from me too.

550
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,280
I can handle everything by myself.

551
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:56,480
I swear you're the expert
on making a guy run away.

552
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,480
You're trying my patience.

553
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,760
Suit yourself. I don't care.

554
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,000
- Give it back.
- Take it.

555
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,480
Give me my coffee back.
Go make your own coffee.

556
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,480
Jeez! I can't deal with you right now.

557
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,360
Cemre, please help me out.

558
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,240
I want to dance at the wedding too,
but they won't let me.

559
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,160
Please make them let me.

560
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,880
Forget about the dance, Tuna.
We're trying to talk.

561
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,960
Tuna, why would you be dancing?
Don't be ridiculous.

562
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,760
You know what? Let him. Poor guy.

563
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,840
How do you like the baby blue ones?

564
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,320
Come here. She's wants baby blue.

565
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,920
Is that Cemre?

566
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,040
Hey, Cemre. How are things with Poyraz?

567
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,840
Are you two getting along?

568
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,920
Don't even let me start.
We're getting along <i>so </i>well.

569
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,560
<i>- Oh! Are these blue ones the same?
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

570
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,840
<i>Well, I don't think so.
Don't you have more?</i>

571
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,800
<i>They're the same flowers, ma'am.</i>

572
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,360
- I hate them. No.
- No.

573
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,320
Don't they have any pink ones?
Like, powder pink?

574
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,480
What about these lilac ones, girls?

575
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,760
<i>How many baby blue ones can you get me?</i>

576
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,960
<i>- Twenty, maybe thirty.
- All right.</i>

577
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,160
I liked the bright orange ones too.
Bring them over.

578
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,480
I want to compare. That's pretty much it.

579
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,160
<i>Do you have more yellow ones?</i>

580
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,960
Oh, the invites! We haven't shown her.

581
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,200
- No yellow.
- Cemre.

582
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,880
<i>What do you think? We loved it.</i>

583
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,720
It looks awesome.
How many guests will be there?

584
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,240
You know, just us.

585
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,720
- Like, 25 to 50 people.
- Tops.

586
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,000
What? 25 to 50? "Just us," huh?

587
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,160
Add ten more and book a venue, girl.

588
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,560
<i>- You have more of these?
- No, ma'am.</i>

589
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,400
Fine, then. Pack them up.

590
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,800
Everyone's insane over here.

591
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,040
I shouldn't have trusted you anyway.

592
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,400
Of course he'll go insane

593
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,480
if you ask him for ten different flowers
of the same shade.

594
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,320
They were not the same color! Jeez!

595
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,280
How do you know?

596
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,560
I hear about everything around here.

597
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,120
It seems the news
spread like Wi-Fi over here.

598
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,840
All right. Don't get mad.

599
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,720
Just tell me what you want.
I'll go get them from Osman.

600
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,000
I don't want anything from him anymore.

601
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,240
Cemre, stop!

602
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,920
I mean…

603
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,720
What the heck? What is this?

604
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,720
You saw me with the brush and the paint.
What did it look like I was doing?

605
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,320
Jeez!

606
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,920
CATERING COMPANIES

607
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,600
- Yeah?
- Hey, Cemre.

608
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,800
I swear I'm going to kill Tuna.

609
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,200
Please ask her what I even said
for her to get so mad.

610
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,920
I just told her
she should wear this black dress.

611
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,600
I only told her to be modern and bold.

612
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,440
Is that Cemre?

613
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,000
Hey, Cemre.

614
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,760
What's up?

615
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,040
How's Poyraz? Is everything okay?

616
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,560
<i>Let's not talk about him.
He's so annoying.</i>

617
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,560
<i>I've spent my morning
trying to get the paint stains off.</i>

618
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,880
Forget about me now.
Tuna, what's with the black dress?

619
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:17,360
Why are you so dismissive, honey?
Look how elegant it is.

620
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,000
It's so different.

621
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,960
Tuna, you can't pick her dress too.
Leave her alone.

622
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,680
Jeez. Fine!

623
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,280
You look nervous.
Is there something wrong?

624
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:31,040
Well, I can't find my locket necklace
<i>or </i>any caterers.

625
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:34,360
Honey, we looked everywhere
but couldn't find your necklace.

626
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,920
But hear me out.

627
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,960
Make sure we have pickles and plums
at the cocktail before the wedding.

628
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,840
- It's crucial. Okay?
- Hang on a minute.

629
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,120
- Wait.
- What's up?

630
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,080
Is that Poyraz? Cemre!

631
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,480
Kisses. Talk to you later. Bye.

632
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,400
I'd ask if you needed any help,
but you'd say…

633
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,680
I'd say yes.

634
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:59,120
- Did you hit your head? You okay?
- Fine. Just leave.

635
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,680
I was just joking.

636
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,840
I was born here.
Just tell me what you need.

637
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,080
Catering. All caterers are booked.

638
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,840
You hungry?

639
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,200
How is this helping, Poyraz?

640
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,640
It is.

641
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,400
We'll eat and take care of the catering.

642
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,480
What do you say?

643
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:18,920
Okay.

644
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,600
- Come on. Let's go.
- All right.

645
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,280
Stop! Pull over!

646
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,360
What is it?

647
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,000
Damn it. Someone stole my van.

648
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,920
Oh, that? Calm down.

649
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,240
I had it towed this morning.
They'll fix it up and bring it over.

650
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,440
Why'd you do that?

651
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,720
You were exhausted and busy.

652
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,400
I did it so you could
focus on the wedding.

653
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,560
Oh.

654
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,720
You're welcome.

655
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,080
I didn't say thanks.

656
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,360
I know.

657
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,280
MEATBALL &amp; SAUSAGE SANDWICH

658
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,480
Here you go.

659
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,160
- So?
- So?

660
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,160
I mean, look around you.

661
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,960
It's a small town.
There's no catering company.

662
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,160
- You won't regret it.
- Right.

663
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,040
Poyraz!

664
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,400
Where have you been, kid?
I haven't seen you in days.

665
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,640
- Welcome, honey.
- Thanks. Hello.

666
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,280
- Tell me about it, Suna.
- I was so busy.

667
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,600
- And you know, Emir's…
- I heard. He's getting married.

668
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,200
Yeah. At the ranch too.

669
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,480
I guess it's your turn now, huh?

670
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,440
What would you like to have?
How about an olive oil dish?

671
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,080
We'll trust you with it.

672
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,960
Right away.

673
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,280
Hey. Don't pout. Just trust me.

674
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,720
- Trust has gotten me nowhere yet.
- What'd you say?

675
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,840
I was just saying Emir and you…
You're so different.

676
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,880
Oh, that? Yeah, we are.

677
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,760
Emir's the spoiled one in our family.
I'm more of a planner.

678
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,360
Never mind us. What about you?

679
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,640
Leyla, you, the others…
Who are you? What do you do?

680
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,000
Leyla, Tuna, and I are childhood friends.

681
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,960
Our moms were friends in high school.
We stayed in touch.

682
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,640
I see. And the others?

683
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,880
Melis and Sinem.
We met them in middle school.

684
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,560
Emir had told me about you guys.

685
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,680
I wish he'd told us about you.

686
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,200
So you live here, right?

687
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,320
I was in the UK, but I came back.
Emir stayed there.

688
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,640
I guess he's coming back too,
with Leyla and all…

689
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,600
Maybe they'll go together.

690
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,040
Here you go.

691
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,840
- Thank you.
- Here we go. I'll get that.

692
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,920
Bon appétit.

693
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,200
Thanks, Suna.

694
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,040
Leyla and Emir are
like two peas in a pod, right?

695
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,200
They just met,
and we're planning the wedding.

696
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,360
They've been together
for what, four months?

697
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,920
- Yeah.
- Wow.

698
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,400
Love at first sight, huh?

699
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,840
Yeah, right. Love.

700
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,120
Oh, come on.
I mean, you're not against love, are you?

701
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,680
What? Of course not.

702
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,000
But you're pouting.

703
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,080
- No, I'm not.
- You did it again.

704
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,440
Did what?

705
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:16,680
You're like, cringing or something
when I mention love.

706
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:21,080
I'll hit you with this fork so hard
you'll be counting stars.

707
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:24,080
Jeez! Love this, love that.
You can't shut up about it.

708
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,400
We were just having a nice conversation,
but you had to do what you always do.

709
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,200
I didn't do anything. It was you.

710
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,560
And it's not about me. It's about them.

711
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,520
What? It was never about you anyway.

712
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,760
We're talking about
how they fell in love with each other.

713
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,600
Why are you even offended?

714
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,040
God give me patience. Fine, dude.

715
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,960
Fine. They're very much in love.

716
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,080
They're so in love

717
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,360
that Emir just shows up and proposes
and we're planning a wedding the next day.

718
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,640
Bravo. I wouldn't bother
if I didn't have respect for love.

719
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,600
You're here for your friend, not love.

720
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:41,960
Good morning.

721
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,760
Oh, no. What time is it?

722
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,960
Almost 9:00 a.m. Morning.

723
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:52,160
- Damn. I need to handle the fabrics.
- But it was on track yesterday.

724
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:56,240
They emailed me after you left.
They can't get the ones I want in time.

725
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,080
Nothing goes my way.

726
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,240
That sucks.

727
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,240
May I help?

728
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,280
No, I'll handle it.
I'm going to the town today anyway.

729
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,960
I'll get to the electrical, then.

730
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,240
- Okay.
- See you.

731
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:11,760
- Do you even know about that stuff?
- I'm not here for that, ma'am.

732
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:15,600
What? Oh, sorry. Hang on.
I totally forgot about you.

733
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,480
Follow me.

734
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,920
You know what I need?

735
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,360
Hi, Poyraz. This was in the van.

736
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,640
Let me see.

737
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,480
Well, I can't find my locket necklace
<i>or </i>any caterers.

738
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,400
I want some flowers.
The bride and groom will be here.

739
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,400
Some flowers up here so they can hang.

740
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,920
That's what I'd like.

741
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,000
Thanks. Let's go.

742
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,880
- Here's your hot chocolate.
- Thank you.

743
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,240
Is this what you do?
I mean, are you a wedding planner?

744
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,880
No. I'm actually a veterinarian.

745
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,520
But when I lost my dog
on my first year on the job,

746
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,400
I took a short break.

747
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:12,680
As in?

748
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,480
Ten years.

749
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,600
What a short break.

750
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,720
I'm currently a columnist
for a pet magazine,

751
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:25,320
and I plan my friends' weddings
as a hobby.

752
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,640
I think you're really good.
You should go for it.

753
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:33,640
I had decided I'd do exactly that, but…

754
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,360
But what?

755
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,120
Mete didn't like the idea.

756
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,120
- Mete?
- My boyfriend.

757
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,040
No, I mean… My ex-boyfriend.

758
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:46,360
- Your ex?
- Yeah.

759
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:47,880
I see.

760
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,120
I think that was really unfair of him.

761
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,320
You're good. You should do it.

762
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,520
You think so?

763
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,320
I don't know. I think he was right.

764
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:02,240
I had fights with literally everyone
since I came here.

765
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,040
I even drove <i>you</i> insane.

766
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:08,280
I mean, if you consider
what we've been through in two days,

767
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:11,240
I think we've come a long way,
don't you think?

768
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:15,680
You're right. It's a miracle we survived.

769
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:22,320
All joking aside, I wouldn't have been
able to do it without you.

770
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,640
What about your friends?

771
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:29,040
I mean, if you didn't have me,
all by yourself in a strange place…

772
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,200
They wanted to come, but...

773
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,480
Right. I know the story.

774
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,400
I'm not surprised.

775
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,600
You think men don't gossip?

776
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:44,400
I think we need
something stronger than hot chocolate.

777
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:47,760
I'll be right back.

778
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:07,960
What's up with you?

779
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,280
- I was at the dress rehearsal.
- And?

780
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,360
It was bad, Tuna.

781
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:15,680
It was too fluffy and then not fluffy.
The beads weren't working.

782
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,640
I don't have time. I'm nervous.

783
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:21,960
What's up with <i>you?</i>

784
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,840
I watched another romance flick
with a sad ending.

785
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:29,000
You're an adult, Tuna. For God's sake.

786
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,360
You're callous.

787
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,680
- Yeah?
<i>- Hello? Tuna?</i>

788
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,600
No, we don't use gas cylinders.

789
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,120
<i>Hello? Tuna? It's Mete, man.</i>

790
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:45,800
Well, we don't use that either.
<i>It's Mete, not the cylinder salesman.</i>

791
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,480
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Well, see…

792
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:48,800
I'll call you later.

793
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,920
I'll give you a call later.

794
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,200
<i>- It's Mete, man.</i>
- Yeah.

795
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:55,320
- What are you talking about? Come on.
- All right…

796
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,200
<i>Hello?</i>

797
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:04,920
<i>Sorry for disturbing you,
but I couldn't reach the others.</i>

798
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
<i>They blocked me.</i>

799
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,200
<i>I was worried about Cemre.
I hope she's okay.</i>

800
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:11,960
<i>Hello?</i>

801
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,960
<i>I wanted to tell you something.
Hello? Tuna?</i>

802
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:22,240
<i>Anyway, hit me up when you're available.
I need to talk to Cemre. It's important.</i>

803
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,000
<i>Bye.</i>

804
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,000
- What's going on, Tuna?
- What do you mean?

805
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,520
Why are you talking to him?

806
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:33,800
Well, you heard him.
You all blocked him, so he called me.

807
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:37,680
There was a reason we did that.
How are you going to justify it to her?

808
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,160
I don't know, Leyla.

809
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,840
I'm going to kill you, Tuna.

810
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,920
So, what's your story?

811
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,840
I don't have one.

812
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,960
I won't let you off the hook so easily.

813
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:55,480
You <i>have</i> to have an awful story
since you moved from the UK to this town.

814
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,360
Are you always so sure of everything?

815
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,840
Maybe I just missed my hometown
and moved back.

816
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:03,960
Nope.

817
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,920
Did you go bankrupt?

818
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Oh, you were cheated on!
With your best friend too.

819
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,400
<i>And </i>you got conned.

820
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:14,400
Wow, man.
You have a strong imagination. Jeez.

821
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,880
That's basically
three-seasons worth of material.

822
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,640
Tell me. Which one was it?

823
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:21,960
My girlfriend.

824
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:23,760
Your girlfriend?

825
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,880
I mean… My ex-girlfriend.

826
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,720
She chose to go on yacht tours
with my boss

827
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,120
over living with me.

828
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,000
What a hussy.

829
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,160
Why did she do it
when she had a guy like you?

830
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,200
A guy like me?

831
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,560
I mean, look at you.

832
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:46,680
I mean, knock on wood,
you're totally a snack.

833
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:50,800
You have this mysterious aura,

834
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,600
but that makes you even cooler somehow.

835
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,960
And when you laugh…

836
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,600
Yeah, right there.

837
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,080
You have that dimple over here.

838
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,040
That's pretty neat.

839
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:12,240
Well, enough chatting. Coffee?

840
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:15,800
With you pissing the florist off,
we should talk about the wedding.

841
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:16,880
What do you say?

842
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,600
Can we just
not talk about the wedding tonight?

843
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,520
Huh?

844
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,120
He even took his shower.

845
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,280
What did you do, Cemre?

846
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,440
- Take it.
- Come on, guys.

847
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,760
- I missed this. The three of us.
- A selfie?

848
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:06,680
- Don't tell the girls about it.
- We'll send it to them.

849
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,040
- There. Awesome.
- I'll send it to you.

850
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:12,440
So? How's it going?

851
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,240
<i>Any movement?</i>

852
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:17,160
<i>How do you not remember the night at all?</i>

853
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,800
I just don't.

854
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:22,320
It's all quiet. When will you get here?

855
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,240
We're on our way, babe.

856
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:28,800
It wouldn't help even if we teleported.
You can't hide from the guy.

857
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:29,960
For God's sake.

858
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,120
I mean, I didn't say I was going to hide.

859
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,960
<i>- Right.
- Listen, Cemre.</i>

860
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:41,160
<i>Escaping that cool guy's strong arms
is a true test of will, girl.</i>

861
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:45,160
If you can pull it off,
I'll give you a kiss when I'm there.

862
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,400
Oh, shut up.

863
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,520
Morning.

864
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,840
Leyla, you have to look.

865
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,440
- Leyla, you have to look!
- Oh my God!

866
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,720
What are you doing here, huh? What?

867
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,160
I'm getting coffee.

868
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,880
Why are you getting it topless?

869
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,920
Go put a shirt on. Shame on you.

870
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,160
Or just go home.

871
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,400
Well, that's not
what you were saying last night.

872
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,200
Oh, no! He's talking about last night.

873
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,600
- It was amazing.
- Don't touch me. Shut up.

874
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:25,480
- Damn it!
- All right. Calm down. I was just joking.

875
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:27,400
- Were you?
- Of course I was.

876
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,520
- Oh.
- I was home. Don't worry.

877
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,000
Good. Why did you take
a shower here, then?

878
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:36,200
Well, I had an incident with a rascal,
so I had to.

879
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:38,800
You're seriously acting suspicious.

880
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,400
My little girl.

881
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:44,520
- Your little girl?
- Yeah. She had pissed on me.

882
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,040
What else was I supposed to do?

883
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:50,520
What's up with you and your vibe morning?

884
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:53,040
You're acting like a homicide detective.

885
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,200
I'll leave if you don't want me here.

886
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,880
Hang on. Wait.

887
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,360
You have a little girl?

888
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:03,360
You should really see her sometime.

889
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,560
You'll fall in love with her.
She's so cuddly and all.

890
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,680
Yeah, I'm sure she is.
Why didn't you tell me before?

891
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,360
Tell you what? That I had a little girl?

892
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,440
- Yeah.
- Does it matter to you?

893
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:19,720
I would've told you first thing if I knew.

894
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:23,160
You know, when you fall into my arms.

895
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:25,640
Where's she?

896
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:28,000
She's probably strolling around.

897
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,600
Strolling around?

898
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:32,040
You left her?
What if she fell or got lost?

899
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:35,000
Oh, come on. Don't be negative.
I'm sure she's around.

900
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:38,280
"Come on"? What the heck?
You're a terrible dad.

901
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:41,320
Hey, kid! Where are you, kid?

902
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:44,880
What? "Kid"? That's rude.
You can't call her that.

903
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,520
Tell me her name, then.

904
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,120
- Little Girl.
- Little…

905
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,520
- "Little Girl"?
- Yeah.

906
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,360
Who names their kid "Little Girl"?

907
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,600
Me. Little Girl!

908
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,280
Little Girl!

909
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,800
Hey, Little Girl. Come here.

910
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,960
Come. Where are you going? Come on.

911
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:04,440
Come here. Come here, you.

912
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,560
Look how adorable she is.

913
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:09,560
Were you talking about a dog?

914
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,840
Please. She has a name. Little Girl.

915
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,200
I'll show you her name. Give her here.

916
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,000
For you.

917
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:21,560
For me?

918
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:29,560
Would you look at that cute face?
What a cutie-pie.

919
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,960
Good. You're not like your dad at all.

920
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,480
You never miss a chance
to taunt me. Bravo, Cemre.

921
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:38,000
Yeah, right. "Bravo, Cemre."

922
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,400
What a cute tiny baby.

923
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:44,240
Hey, Little Girl.

924
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:49,320
You're so adorable.
Oh, are you swimming in the air?

925
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:00,720
That's pretty much it.
We're childhood friends with Leyla.

926
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:03,480
Cool. I had Emir instead.

927
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:06,120
He started fights and ran away,
leaving me behind.

928
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,120
You used to fight?

929
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:12,040
There's a reason I have such strong arms.
All the beatings I endured.

930
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,600
You mean these things?

931
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:17,920
Let's check.

932
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:25,000
We never talked about their first dance.
Which song are we going with?

933
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:27,280
I have a few on my phone.

934
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:29,840
Let's see.

935
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:33,720
How about this?

936
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:22,760
Wow. They're flirting hard, aren't they?

937
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:26,080
"My cousin would never
try something with Cemre."

938
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,440
"He isn't interested in a relationship."

939
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:31,720
He's basically glued to her.

940
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:34,400
- Oh, come on.
- Don't be like that, Tuna.

941
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,840
What do you mean, "glued"?

942
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:39,720
What's so bad about it?
They're getting along.

943
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,080
Wow! Incoming kiss. Let's go.

944
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,000
- Let's not, please.
- I can't miss it.

945
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:55,880
- Why are we doing this?
- Come on.

946
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:01,280
- Oh! Hey, girls!
- Hello.

947
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:02,920
- Here we are.
- Welcome.

948
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,600
- Hey.
- Cousin.

949
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,360
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

950
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:08,800
- What's up?
- Checking stuff.

951
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,720
Come here, you. Come.

952
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,440
- Get over here, you.
- Come on.

953
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:13,360
- Hey.
- Okay.

954
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,280
- Hey.
- Hi.

955
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:15,360
Hello.

956
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:22,920
I guess you're going to explain
what we just saw, Cemre.

957
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,280
We were just checking the song.
A little dance.

958
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:29,880
- That's it.
- Yeah? This started with that too.

959
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,480
Don't be like that.

960
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,960
Is everything set for tomorrow?

961
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:36,040
Yeah, babe. Everything's ready.

962
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:41,120
- What are you looking at?
- Just the decoration.

963
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,440
- Yeah?
- We did well.

964
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:45,240
- Are those muscles made of whey?
- What?

965
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:47,400
He's asking if you mean business.

966
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:49,840
- Don't be ridiculous...
- Hang on.

967
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,600
- What's going on between you two?
- Between us?

968
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:54,200
Yeah, between you two.

969
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:58,680
Just show me the table ornaments.

970
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,920
- We'll talk about this.
- Spill. Let's go.

971
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:05,440
Do you always
answer questions with questions?

972
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:09,080
Sorry. I didn't catch that.
What was the question?

973
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:13,120
Is this your actual height?
Any surgeries on the knee?

974
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,840
Jeez, guys. Stop with the dumb questions.

975
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:20,880
Let's just go carry our luggage.
We're going to get a heatstroke.

976
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:23,280
Hang on. Our lives are at stake here.

977
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:26,240
- What are you talking about?
- You know.

978
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:30,040
We don't get married as couples, man.
We do it as a group.

979
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:31,320
- Okay?
- As a group? Okay.

980
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:32,880
- What?
- What do you mean?

981
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:37,480
You brought up the right topic for once
but messed it up so badly. Jeez.

982
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:41,800
I'll explain. I got married ten days ago.
I haven't been able to level up.

983
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:45,680
That means as soon as
I start attacking on the right wing,

984
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,800
I hear the ref's whistle
and he decides to go to VAR.

985
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:51,320
Dude! What does that
have to do with anything?

986
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:52,840
I'm sorry, cousin.

987
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:55,040
Go discuss your issue with your wife.

988
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:56,480
This is not the place.

989
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,320
I'm really sorry, cousin.

990
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,600
Well done. It looks beautiful.

991
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:03,360
- We'll see how you'll do, Emir!
- It does, right?

992
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:06,160
We'll see you on the pitch
trying to attack and attack.

993
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,320
Don't worry about it, man.

994
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,040
"As a group"? Seriously?

995
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:13,240
What was I supposed to say?
You got what I meant.

996
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:14,320
- Teamwork.
- Yeah.

997
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:16,640
- Honey.
- Yeah, baby?

998
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:17,720
Grape, please.

999
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,320
- Here we go.
- You got it?

1000
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:20,720
- Who wants some?
- Me.

1001
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,480
Honey, try this.

1002
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:28,080
How is it? You like it?

1003
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,440
Easy. It's hot. Easy.

1004
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:33,520
I approve.

1005
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:36,600
- Another one?
- Here.

1006
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,880
Thank you so much, Poyraz.
We've been a burden.

1007
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,200
Don't mention it.

1008
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:44,360
It was all Cemre anyway.

1009
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:46,160
But if it weren't for you…

1010
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:50,120
I mean, if it weren't for your help,
everything would be so difficult.

1011
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:54,880
You had it all planned out anyway.
I just helped with the small stuff.

1012
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:57,160
And you deserve the credit.

1013
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:02,200
Well, I'll just go check the meat.

1014
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:08,040
Hey, you. You two are so cute together.

1015
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:09,840
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1016
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,080
Just leave.

1017
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:13,680
- I was just being polite.
- Hey. I get it.

1018
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,360
- Just go.
- All right, honey.

1019
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,400
- You want anything?
- Leave.

1020
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:27,160
How did you two meet?

1021
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:29,720
Well, we met here.

1022
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:32,480
You're a good guy.

1023
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,280
You really are.

1024
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:36,760
Come on. Of course he is.

1025
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:39,840
It's in our genes. We're all good guys.

1026
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,320
Cemre, talk.

1027
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,200
What was that today?

1028
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:50,880
- Cemre, you two were totally...
- Don't be ridiculous.

1029
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,520
<i>Be </i>ridiculous, Leyla.

1030
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,040
Girl, he's smoking hot.

1031
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:56,720
You won't find anyone better,
I'm telling you.

1032
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,560
Smoking hot? Him?

1033
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:01,840
Also, he introduced his dog
like she was her daughter.

1034
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:05,080
Who in their right mind
does something like that?

1035
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:07,120
So you were up for it
if he had a daughter?

1036
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,920
You're really running wild,
aren't you? Jeez.

1037
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:13,560
Want some processed meat?

1038
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:16,920
Hey.

1039
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:19,040
Well, I'm off.

1040
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,800
Guys, I should head home.

1041
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:27,880
The wedding's tomorrow.
I'm sure you have things to do.

1042
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:29,040
Enjoy the meat.

1043
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:30,040
- See you.
- Bye.

1044
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:31,160
- Thanks.
- Good night.

1045
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:33,080
- Nice meeting you. Bye-bye.
- See you.

1046
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,800
Should we believe our eyes and ears?

1047
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:43,040
Tell us what's going on, Cemre.

1048
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Okay. I got carried away a bit.

1049
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,680
Seriously, though. Tell us.

1050
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:51,360
Listen, Cemre. Open your eyes already.

1051
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:54,640
See, even Leyla
outperformed our expectations

1052
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,320
and found someone. Kudos.

1053
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:59,280
Wow. Tuna, thank you so much

1054
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:02,840
for saying nice things about me
on this beautiful night, bro.

1055
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,920
To be honest, I keep looking at her

1056
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,760
trying to figure out
what I did to deserve this girl.

1057
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:13,000
- I keep thinking and thinking.
- Oh, honey.

1058
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:15,320
I still can't.

1059
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:18,760
You keep thinking and thinking
yet can't figure it out.

1060
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:20,160
- I can't.
- Yeah. Anyway.

1061
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:23,760
Look. You obviously like him a lot, babe.

1062
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:26,520
I can tell. You're smitten, even.

1063
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:29,160
Fine. I admit Poyraz made me feel good,

1064
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:31,560
but I spent eight years on Mete.

1065
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,320
And that night…

1066
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,760
I just want to call him and tell him off.

1067
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:39,040
He didn't explain himself.
Didn't even call.

1068
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:42,120
Well, Cemre, I'm kind of sleepy.

1069
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,960
- I am. All right.
- Oh, wow. I ate a lot.

1070
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:46,200
- Good night.
- Let's go.

1071
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:49,840
Honey, the wedding's tomorrow.
I don't need bags under my eyes.

1072
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:52,000
- There's so much meat.
- You can have them.

1073
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:54,080
- You're going to bed? Come on.
- Yeah.

1074
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:56,520
What? We're not hanging out?

1075
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:57,440
- Nah.
- Huh?

1076
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:00,160
- We'll talk later.
- Call me, okay?

1077
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:01,520
- Kisses.
- Let's go.

1078
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,080
- Good night.
- See you all.

1079
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:04,760
- I'll be back, honey.
- Bye.

1080
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:05,880
- Come.
- Let's go.

1081
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:10,400
Let's just not tell her.
Just forget about it.

1082
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:12,080
I wasn't even there.

1083
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:14,160
Don't be ridiculous.

1084
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:18,600
- No secrets. We took an oath.
- Jeez. Who cares about the oath?

1085
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:20,600
We never keep our oaths.

1086
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,800
She's so happy, you know.

1087
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:25,760
Why tell her Mete called and stuff?
Let's just go.

1088
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:26,920
- I agree.
- Me too.

1089
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
- I agree.
- Go.

1090
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
What just happened?

1091
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,240
I have no idea.

1092
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:34,680
I know my wife very well, guys.

1093
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:38,320
She wouldn't give up the gossip
even if her water broke. Something's up.

1094
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:39,640
- But what?
- No idea.

1095
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,160
- Hey, Cemre.
- Yeah?

1096
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:45,600
I might've called him a dumb-ass,
but Poyraz is a good guy.

1097
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:49,360
- I figured him out at the grill.
- Well… Come on, man. Shame.

1098
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,720
He's <i>my</i> cousin, after all.

1099
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,160
Why did they leave?

1100
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:56,080
How would I know?
Jeez. Would I ask you if I knew?

1101
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,880
- God give me patience. Jeez.
- She's leaving too.

1102
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,760
- Why is everyone on edge?
- Good night.

1103
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:05,040
- Weird. I don't get it, man.
- What happened?

1104
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:08,560
Seriously, man.

1105
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:11,480
We were having a nice time.
The vibe was amazing.

1106
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:13,280
Just when it was getting exciting…

1107
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,400
You think this is exciting?

1108
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:19,360
You want me to tell you
about the night Mete dumped Cemre?

1109
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:22,360
- Now, <i>that was</i> exciting.
- Oh, right. What happened?

1110
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:24,040
- Tell me.
- It was like a cup final.

1111
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:25,400
- Yeah?
- So Mete showed up…

1112
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:27,640
Put that in the back.

1113
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:29,440
Nice.

1114
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,920
- Morning, Suna. Hey, guys.
- Morning, Poyraz.

1115
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:36,520
- Morning.
- Morning.

1116
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,480
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1117
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:43,840
Last night was cool.

1118
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:47,720
- After I left, did your friends...
- Hey.

1119
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:51,440
Who are you anyway?
Why would my friends talk about you?

1120
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:55,360
Cemre, you can at least look at me.

1121
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:58,320
I mean, at least when we're talking.

1122
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:01,360
Here. I'm looking.
What's up? You satisfied?

1123
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:03,360
Fine. You're a bit tense.

1124
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,240
I'll just bring you some coffee.

1125
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:08,400
You'll have calmed down,
and we'll talk. All right?

1126
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:09,600
I already had coffee.

1127
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:12,960
Cemre, are you okay?
I mean, everything's fine, right?

1128
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,800
- Jeez.
- Cemre?

1129
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:16,520
Cemre.

1130
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:18,600
Cemre.

1131
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:22,920
What? What do you want?

1132
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:26,000
Are you really okay?
If we could just talk...

1133
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,760
What do we have to talk about?

1134
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:38,000
You men are always the same.
You think the world revolves around you.

1135
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:07,760
Jeez. This usually takes me just a minute.

1136
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,040
It's like I have two left hands. Help me.

1137
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:10,960
- Ozan.
- Let me.

1138
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:14,120
- I swear I'm sick of this.
- Let me see. Hang on.

1139
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:16,040
- Stand tall. There.
- There.

1140
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:18,520
You look amazing, man.
What a beast of a groom!

1141
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:20,080
Thanks, bro.

1142
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:24,240
Don't get him too hyped up.
He's going to be us after the honeymoon.

1143
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:27,040
No, man. Why would I be you?

1144
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:30,440
What's wrong with us?
We love and respect our wives.

1145
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:32,600
The golden rule is to obey.
That's the way.

1146
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:33,840
Hey, cousin.

1147
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:36,800
What's… What's wrong? You okay?

1148
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:40,600
I'm fine. Nothing's wrong.

1149
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:42,960
Look here, you.

1150
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:48,880
I know that face by heart, man.
Cemre told him off.

1151
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:53,680
Man, everything was nice between us
before you guys showed up.

1152
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:56,640
Now she's avoiding me.
She won't even look at me.

1153
01:10:56,720 --> 01:11:00,720
Sounds like she was poisoned.
I bet she talked to the girls.

1154
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:04,200
Dude, what could the girls
possibly have said?

1155
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:05,120
Look, cousin.

1156
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:07,880
If you really like her that much,
just go tell her.

1157
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:09,920
Bang, bang, bang. What's the big deal?

1158
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,880
She wouldn't even look at me.

1159
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:14,200
Are you not listening to me?

1160
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:17,440
Well, okay. Here's what we're going to do.

1161
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:19,640
Emir has a poem he wrote for Leyla.

1162
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:23,040
Just read it to Cemre,
and everything will be fine.

1163
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,600
- A poem?
- Right.

1164
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:26,480
- Since when you're a poet?
- Yeah.

1165
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:29,120
I just wrote the one for Leyla.

1166
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:31,120
You'll just change the name.

1167
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,600
Just hear it out. It's a nice poem.

1168
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:37,520
<i>Leyla, I fell for you
An autumn night it was</i>

1169
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:40,120
<i>Oh, how I fell for you</i>

1170
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,800
<i>Your hair shone like wheat under the sun</i>

1171
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:45,200
<i>Your eyes bluer than the ocean</i>

1172
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:47,600
- Keep going.
<i>- Leyla, Leyla…</i>

1173
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:50,120
It's not finished yet. I'm working on it.

1174
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:51,880
- Bravo!
- Amazing.

1175
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:55,720
A poem dedicated to Leyla
and the fertile soil of Anatolia.

1176
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:58,160
What are you talking about?
A poem? Anatolia?

1177
01:11:58,240 --> 01:11:59,760
You guys have lost it.

1178
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,560
Did I hurt her feelings somehow?

1179
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:04,240
I mean, why is she mad?

1180
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:07,240
No. Man, you're forgetting something.

1181
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:10,160
We don't have to do anything
for them to get mad at us.

1182
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:12,320
See, breathing alone is enough.

1183
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:15,760
Just go look her in the eye
and tell her you care.

1184
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,800
Be bold. Be assertive.

1185
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:20,560
Don't be reciting poems
like this dumb-ass, okay?

1186
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:24,520
What do you guys know about art, anyway?

1187
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:27,840
She wants me to care. Of course.

1188
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:30,520
The necklace.

1189
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,160
- Does it look okay?
- Yeah.

1190
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:34,880
- What's up? What did you do?
- I cracked the case.

1191
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,000
Oh, yeah? Nice.

1192
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:39,080
Hey, listen.
Do I need a boutonniere or something?

1193
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:40,400
Hey, Leyla.

1194
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:42,600
- Is your makeup done?
- Nope.

1195
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,680
- You're going to be late.
- We'll be fine.

1196
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:47,080
You look stunning.

1197
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:51,320
Hey, Sinem. Hand me the water, will you?

1198
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:54,240
Where's Tuna?

1199
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:58,560
What…

1200
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:01,720
I saw my brother-in-law off.

1201
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:05,200
- Which one?
- You're right.

1202
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:08,400
I have so many brothers-in-law now
I get them confused.

1203
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:11,040
Well, not that husbands don't go anywhere.

1204
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:13,600
I meant the new one. Poyraz.

1205
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:15,360
Where did he go?

1206
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:18,320
That's a mystery you're responsible for.

1207
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:22,080
He looked so crushed
because of whatever you said to him.

1208
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:25,120
He was punching trees
with his strong arms and all.

1209
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:29,560
He also told me
he loved me very much as he left.

1210
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:31,040
A small detail.

1211
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:32,800
What did you say to him?

1212
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:36,080
Handsome, educated, well-mannered…

1213
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:38,400
- Understanding.
- Successful.

1214
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:41,760
Jeez. You don't even know
how old he is or what he does.

1215
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:46,120
Electrical engineer, 30 years old, single.

1216
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:50,320
Listen. Whatever you said broke his heart.

1217
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,520
I didn't say anything!

1218
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:56,800
He was all like, "We need to talk."
I already know how that movie ends.

1219
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,160
No, Cemre. You're confused, honey.

1220
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:03,520
Now, in your movie, the protagonist
was a slimy guy named Mete.

1221
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:06,720
This is a totally different movie
with a different guy.

1222
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,000
Yeah, exactly.

1223
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:09,600
Plus, there's a big difference

1224
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:12,120
between the guy
who tossed your spare tire out

1225
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:14,920
and the guy who got your car fixed.

1226
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:19,040
Between the guy who didn't leave your side
even though you cracked his head open

1227
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:21,720
and the guy who told you
to renew your bus pass

1228
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,720
because gas prices were rising.

1229
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:28,600
Also, what role does Poyraz play
that you don't want to watch it again?

1230
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:30,560
I love new movies.

1231
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:32,720
Well, I'm glad he left.

1232
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,200
Leave me alone. It's for the better.

1233
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:38,120
- I don't need him annoying me.
- Yeah, right.

1234
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:13,240
Oh, honey.

1235
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:16,160
Your hair looks awful, Sinem. Come here.

1236
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:17,920
We need to fix it. No time.

1237
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:44,640
Look who's there.

1238
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:23,920
Give me a minute.

1239
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,120
- Huh? What's going on?
- Oh my. Girl.

1240
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:27,640
- Poyraz is here.
- He's here.

1241
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:40,200
I thought you weren't coming.

1242
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:43,000
- Why?
- Because you told Tuna you weren't.

1243
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:44,720
I didn't.

1244
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:49,640
- I told him I was going to get something.
- Get what?

1245
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,000
This.

1246
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:56,240
I think you were looking for it.

1247
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:58,760
I was going to give it to you earlier...

1248
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:11,240
It's the last thing I have
that was Mom's. Thank you.

1249
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:15,200
- Shall I put it on?
- Sure.

1250
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,800
There. Here we go.

1251
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:25,760
Done.

1252
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:30,080
- Everything turned out amazing.
- Thanks to you.

1253
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:33,280
And I'm sorry.

1254
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:34,520
Why?

1255
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:37,600
I took it all out on you.
I was way too harsh.

1256
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,920
I enjoyed it. Every second of it.

1257
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:49,480
Cemre?

1258
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:51,680
Mete?

1259
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:56,200
You blocked me on everything?
I've been trying to reach you.

1260
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:59,160
I called Tuna too.
He answered but never talked.

1261
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:02,960
- What? Girl, it's Mete.
- Mete's here.

1262
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:05,800
- What? What's he doing here?
- Who knows?

1263
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:07,520
- Vermin.
- Filth.

1264
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:11,200
Dude, do you have anything
to do with this?

1265
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,920
Why would I? He just showed up.

1266
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,160
I swear Melis will tear you a new one.

1267
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:18,680
No, I had no idea. He just…

1268
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:20,920
Weird. Anyway.

1269
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,320
Finally, I tried Sinan
and he told me you'd be here.

1270
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:25,760
Why are you here?

1271
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:28,040
Are you seriously hearing him out?

1272
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:35,160
I left my diving gear with you.
You know that stuff is expensive.

1273
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:36,720
I haven't slept in days.

1274
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:39,240
I'm scared you'll throw them away
out of spite.

1275
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:42,000
When can I get it?

1276
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:43,760
What?

1277
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:47,280
My diving gear, Cemre.
You didn't throw them out, right?

1278
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:49,160
Your diving gear?

1279
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:52,400
Yes. It's expensive stuff.
I hope you still have them.

1280
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:54,160
Diving, huh?

1281
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:02,320
- What is he going to do?
- Jeez.

1282
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:09,760
I spend eight whole years,

1283
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:12,320
and you're here
asking for your diving gear?

1284
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:15,320
- I just wanted to talk.
- Just leave. Jeez.

1285
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:17,120
I will. When are you coming?

1286
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:20,280
I don't know. Maybe I will, maybe I won't.

1287
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:22,120
I owe someone coffee.

1288
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:24,520
Let's go.

1289
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:28,600
Where are you going?

1290
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:29,840
Oh, fuck off.

1291
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:43,880
- They're holding hands.
- They are.

1292
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:44,960
He went for it.

1293
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:51,040
- You were holding hands.
- Honey.

1294
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Unbelievable!

1295
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:56,960
My new brother-in-law!

1296
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:02,920
Ms. Leyla Özay, do you,

1297
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:07,120
by your own free will
and under no one's pressure,

1298
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:10,720
take Mr. Emir Ergin
to be your wedded husband?

1299
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:16,960
No!

1300
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:18,840
- What?
- It's coming!

1301
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:20,080
- Jeez…
- Sinan!

1302
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:22,720
- Honey?
- I hope you're just peeing!

1303
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:26,160
- Pick her up! She's in labor!
- All right.

1304
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:28,320
- Let's just...
- It's all right, honey.

1305
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:29,960
Hey, come here.

1306
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:32,000
- You all stay here.
- Let's get the van.

1307
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:34,640
- We'll bring it around.
- Go! Pick her up!

1308
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:35,800
We need to sign...

1309
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:37,160
- She's in labor.
- Careful.

1310
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:40,120
- Let's think about the baby stuff.
- Careful.

1311
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:43,280
- What did you get for it?
- Let's go, people!

1312
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:45,600
- I'll drive.
- Okay.

1313
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:46,840
Let's go.

1314
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:49,160
- The baby's coming!
- Bring the van!

1315
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:52,480
- Do you have a crib?
- All right.

1316
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:55,280
- Clear the way. Go.
- Come on, people.

1317
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:56,680
Here we go.

1318
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:58,440
- I'm in labor!
- All right.

1319
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:00,600
Come on. Drive safely.

1320
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:02,120
- Come on.
- Hey.

1321
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:05,320
- Keep it coming. Come on.
- Damn it, Sinan!

1322
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:06,840
- Is everyone here?
- Yes!

1323
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:07,800
Let's go, baby.

1324
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:09,040
Let's go!
