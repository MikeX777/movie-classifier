2
00:01:49,935 --> 00:01:51,503
Bobby, what's the action?

3
00:01:52,638 --> 00:01:56,174
Five to one, and
she's the five.

4
00:02:10,221 --> 00:02:11,490
Five, one odds.

5
00:02:11,523 --> 00:02:13,792
Five red, one blondie.

6
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,709
Oh!

7
00:03:03,742 --> 00:03:06,344
Oh, that's gotta hurt.

8
00:03:29,467 --> 00:03:30,769
Oh, no!

9
00:03:37,341 --> 00:03:38,911
These bills are
for me, blondie.

10
00:03:42,413 --> 00:03:44,817
I'm never betting
against you again.

11
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,019
You should come
around more often.

12
00:03:47,052 --> 00:03:48,587
I need to update my ride.

13
00:04:03,068 --> 00:04:04,469
Didn't know you
were so interested

14
00:04:04,503 --> 00:04:05,771
in coming back around, Kat.

15
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:08,907
I have my reasons.

16
00:04:09,908 --> 00:04:10,909
Yeah.

17
00:04:12,077 --> 00:04:13,545
I bet.

18
00:04:20,953 --> 00:04:23,922
Times have changed since
you've been around, Kat.

19
00:04:23,956 --> 00:04:24,957
Look around.

20
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:28,927
No really, look around.

21
00:04:30,428 --> 00:04:32,965
This is all mine now.

22
00:04:32,998 --> 00:04:36,034
It's no place for a
good girl like you.

23
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:38,670
I'd like to give you 24
to get out of town but,

24
00:04:40,005 --> 00:04:42,574
I didn't get where I
am by trusting people.

25
00:04:42,608 --> 00:04:47,613
And something tells me that
you just won't go away.

26
00:04:49,548 --> 00:04:50,549
So,

27
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,919
sorry it has to go
down like this, Kat.

28
00:05:06,565 --> 00:05:08,033
What do you want?

29
00:05:41,567 --> 00:05:43,367
What you looking for, blondie?

30
00:05:44,736 --> 00:05:47,471
'Cause you know there so
much to see around here.

31
00:05:50,609 --> 00:05:55,614
So uh, if you find
anything let me know, okay?

32
00:05:58,917 --> 00:05:59,918
You hear me.

33
00:05:59,952 --> 00:06:01,854
Yeah, I'll let you know.

34
00:06:01,887 --> 00:06:03,121
So what's your name?

35
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:04,022
Kat.

36
00:06:04,056 --> 00:06:06,491
Word is you're in for
murder, is that right?

37
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,998
Okay, right.

38
00:06:13,031 --> 00:06:15,934
Listen, no one's going
anywhere around here,

39
00:06:16,869 --> 00:06:19,638
so let's be cool, okay?

40
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,607
I mean, I don't need enemies.

41
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,141
I'm Vegas.

42
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:25,477
People ask me,
what's it short for?

43
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,045
I say it's short for Vegas.

44
00:06:29,114 --> 00:06:30,883
Okay, so I'm a jackass.

45
00:06:31,917 --> 00:06:32,985
What are you gonna do?

46
00:06:33,785 --> 00:06:35,120
Step on
out, lunch time.

47
00:06:35,153 --> 00:06:37,823
Hey, wanna do lunch?

48
00:07:02,681 --> 00:07:04,415
We're not sitting over there.

49
00:07:05,684 --> 00:07:06,685
Let's sit here.

50
00:07:11,256 --> 00:07:12,591
Who is that?

51
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:14,893
Val.

52
00:07:14,927 --> 00:07:17,496
Bad ass bitch in for
murder just like you.

53
00:07:18,497 --> 00:07:20,098
Maybe you two will hit it off.

54
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,938
Whoa, slow down
chief, I said maybe.

55
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:28,974
What are you in for?

56
00:07:30,842 --> 00:07:32,044
Dealing drugs.

57
00:07:32,978 --> 00:07:34,179
Dealing myself.

58
00:07:35,881 --> 00:07:38,617
And beating up my old
lover with a crowbar.

59
00:07:39,851 --> 00:07:41,920
You ever love anyone, Kat?

60
00:07:41,954 --> 00:07:43,522
Yeah.

61
00:07:43,555 --> 00:07:44,856
And?

62
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:45,891
I shot him.

63
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:48,093
Cool.

64
00:07:49,561 --> 00:07:51,063
So you know how it is?

65
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:52,097
Yeah.

66
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:17,089
Lookin' fit, Kat.

67
00:08:18,757 --> 00:08:19,758
Eight,

68
00:08:20,859 --> 00:08:22,294
nine,

69
00:08:22,327 --> 00:08:23,929
ten.

70
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:24,963
Whoa.

71
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,500
You know, you look like a fire.

72
00:08:30,168 --> 00:08:31,803
But you better keep it quiet.

73
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:34,906
You know, the girls will
challenge you around here.

74
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,677
So you're saying you don't
want to be tough in here?

75
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,679
No, I ain't a fighter.

76
00:08:42,214 --> 00:08:44,149
I do yoga and,

77
00:08:47,219 --> 00:08:49,554
I'd rather paint your nails,

78
00:08:49,588 --> 00:08:50,922
take your drugs,

79
00:08:52,724 --> 00:08:53,725
all of them.

80
00:09:01,066 --> 00:09:03,135
Heads up, we got company.

81
00:09:10,108 --> 00:09:12,611
Sup bitches, you
wanna work in with us?

82
00:09:12,644 --> 00:09:13,912
Shut up, Vegas.

83
00:09:13,945 --> 00:09:16,314
We're hear to talk
to the new girl.

84
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:17,649
Lay the ground rules.

85
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:21,653
Get assigned a job
here yet, Miss,

86
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:24,222
whatever your name is.

87
00:09:24,256 --> 00:09:27,692
'Cause if so, we get 20%,

88
00:09:27,726 --> 00:09:28,860
you get safe.

89
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,267
Cat got your tongue.

90
00:09:38,804 --> 00:09:40,839
Yeah, they gave me a job.

91
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,241
Yeah, what's that?

92
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,078
Yard work.

93
00:10:12,804 --> 00:10:14,172
You, wait outside.

94
00:10:19,811 --> 00:10:22,747
That's quite a first impression
in the yard out there, Kat.

95
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:24,749
It's Kat, right?

96
00:10:26,818 --> 00:10:28,820
Well honestly, it
doesn't matter.

97
00:10:28,854 --> 00:10:30,155
You're here off the record.

98
00:10:30,188 --> 00:10:33,391
No one knows you're here
and no one ever will.

99
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:36,995
So my advice to
you is to be cool,

100
00:10:37,028 --> 00:10:40,899
make some friends,
take up some hobbies,

101
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:43,668
and look forward to
our social events.

102
00:10:43,702 --> 00:10:45,337
Because let me say,

103
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:48,773
you will look stunning
at the prison prom.

104
00:10:49,975 --> 00:10:52,144
Or you can be this.

105
00:10:52,177 --> 00:10:54,112
And this place kind of has a way

106
00:10:54,146 --> 00:10:56,381
of policing itself at times.

107
00:10:56,414 --> 00:10:59,951
So either the inmates
beat me, or you do.

108
00:10:59,985 --> 00:11:00,986
No.

109
00:11:01,753 --> 00:11:03,188
No.

110
00:11:03,221 --> 00:11:06,091
I don't do any of the
beatings, he does.

111
00:11:18,203 --> 00:11:19,905
Do you feel any nausea?

112
00:11:20,939 --> 00:11:22,274
Dizzyness?

113
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:23,775
Headaches?

114
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:24,809
No.

115
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:31,750
What exactly are you
checking for, doc?

116
00:11:31,783 --> 00:11:34,953
I'm looking for
signs of a concussion.

117
00:11:36,788 --> 00:11:41,760
Well, it's kind of
my ribs and my lip.

118
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,798
Here's a balm.

119
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:50,368
Put it on, it will help
expedite the healing process.

120
00:11:50,402 --> 00:11:52,871
It'll help the
bruises heal faster.

121
00:11:52,904 --> 00:11:56,208
And don't fuss with
it for several hours.

122
00:11:56,241 --> 00:11:57,943
Anything else?

123
00:11:57,976 --> 00:12:00,445
Guard, we're done here.

124
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:05,083
My advice to you, leave the
balm on and stay out of trouble.

125
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:17,195
Your girl is
quite the handful.

126
00:12:18,797 --> 00:12:19,864
She's a Hellcat.

127
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:23,034
What plan do you
have here for her?

128
00:12:26,004 --> 00:12:29,374
I want her alive,
just uncomfortable.

129
00:12:31,276 --> 00:12:32,277
Break her.

130
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:34,913
That's not going to be easy.

131
00:12:37,816 --> 00:12:38,883
Is that a problem?

132
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:42,220
No, no problem.

133
00:12:42,254 --> 00:12:45,257
I just wish I had a little more
knowledge on this situation.

134
00:12:47,025 --> 00:12:49,027
She stays in permanently.

135
00:12:50,262 --> 00:12:52,063
I don't want her dead
and running the risk

136
00:12:52,097 --> 00:12:55,033
of making her some kind of
martyr hero for the Hellcats.

137
00:12:56,835 --> 00:12:58,203
Or the Vipers for that matter.

138
00:12:59,337 --> 00:13:00,438
If they find out
she died in prison

139
00:13:00,472 --> 00:13:02,307
for a crime she did not commit,

140
00:13:04,477 --> 00:13:06,378
I think you know
what I'm getting at.

141
00:13:08,313 --> 00:13:09,981
Keep her in there.

142
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,384
Keep her uncomfortable.

143
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,386
Keep everything off the record.

144
00:13:16,187 --> 00:13:17,956
That's all the
Knowledge you need.

145
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,091
Right.

146
00:13:23,361 --> 00:13:24,362
Better yet,

147
00:13:26,965 --> 00:13:28,133
I'll go talk to her.

148
00:13:36,908 --> 00:13:37,909
Sorry.

149
00:13:40,145 --> 00:13:41,146
Hi.

150
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,483
I'm uh, not completely
prepared here.

151
00:13:44,517 --> 00:13:46,585
I don't have a file
on you, which is odd.

152
00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:49,020
But I'm working on that.

153
00:13:50,088 --> 00:13:51,189
I'm Philip Boucher.

154
00:13:51,222 --> 00:13:53,925
I'm the counselor
here at the facility,

155
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,461
but you can read that.

156
00:13:56,495 --> 00:13:59,064
Um, it's Kat, right?

157
00:14:03,068 --> 00:14:06,971
So um, I have a confidentiality
agreement with you so,

158
00:14:07,005 --> 00:14:08,574
if you need to vent or,

159
00:14:08,607 --> 00:14:11,309
I mean basically, whatever you
say with me, stays with me.

160
00:14:11,343 --> 00:14:13,512
And if you're not comfortable
talking to other people

161
00:14:13,546 --> 00:14:14,946
you can come to me.

162
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,948
I'm here for your
emotional support.

163
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,618
Also, if you need like
a specific job detail,

164
00:14:19,652 --> 00:14:22,420
or you know, you want a
specific area of employment

165
00:14:22,454 --> 00:14:24,022
or whatever, I can uh,

166
00:14:24,055 --> 00:14:27,025
I can put in a good word
and try and set that up.

167
00:14:27,058 --> 00:14:29,094
So, where would
you like to begin.

168
00:14:29,127 --> 00:14:30,362
I think we're done here.

169
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,599
I get it, you're new here.

170
00:14:33,632 --> 00:14:34,633
So am I.

171
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:37,268
I get my bachelors in psychology
and they send me here.

172
00:14:37,302 --> 00:14:39,070
It's not exactly
paradise, I know.

173
00:14:44,543 --> 00:14:46,679
I realize there's a
lot to process here.

174
00:14:46,712 --> 00:14:48,346
So, we can check
in in a few days

175
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,616
and I'll see how
you're doing then.

176
00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:52,150
In the meantime, if
you need anything,

177
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:55,621
I'm here from eight to
four, Monday through Friday.

178
00:16:21,807 --> 00:16:23,408
Hey chick.

179
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:27,613
Poker game going on in the
rec hall at seven, you in?

180
00:16:27,646 --> 00:16:29,113
I'll be there.

181
00:16:29,147 --> 00:16:30,148
Cool.

182
00:18:03,174 --> 00:18:04,175
Ow.

183
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,183
Get her up.

184
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,721
No no.

185
00:18:20,526 --> 00:18:22,293
Liking your new home, Kat?

186
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,228
Fuck you.

187
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:31,570
You know Kat, I could
kill you any time I want.

188
00:18:34,439 --> 00:18:35,440
Any time.

189
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,110
The thing I'm
struggling with is,

190
00:18:41,212 --> 00:18:43,381
do I keep you around
for something special,

191
00:18:45,551 --> 00:18:47,720
or do I just be done with you?

192
00:18:49,788 --> 00:18:52,256
I like my women dangerous, Kat.

193
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,259
You know this.

194
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,261
You know.

195
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:02,668
But with you,

196
00:19:04,202 --> 00:19:05,203
I

197
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:06,905
just

198
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:08,139
can't

199
00:19:09,374 --> 00:19:10,375
decide.

200
00:19:14,813 --> 00:19:17,148
I asked you something before.

201
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,551
What do you want?

202
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:23,221
I already have what I want.

203
00:19:23,254 --> 00:19:24,923
Vipers and Hellcats are gone.

204
00:19:24,957 --> 00:19:26,558
Just the Demons now.

205
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,695
What I want,

206
00:19:32,498 --> 00:19:33,832
is to keep it that way.

207
00:20:54,646 --> 00:20:55,647
Move.

208
00:21:10,428 --> 00:21:11,930
You guys just start?

209
00:21:11,964 --> 00:21:13,632
Maybe.

210
00:21:13,665 --> 00:21:14,867
Deal me in?

211
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,934
Cool with that?

212
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:25,443
You gotta put your
bet down, girl.

213
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:28,547
I'll be earning
cash here next week.

214
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,349
Asking the counselor to
hook me up with a job.

215
00:21:31,382 --> 00:21:32,618
I'll put down a weeks pay.

216
00:21:35,621 --> 00:21:36,655
Okay.

217
00:21:36,688 --> 00:21:38,490
I'll raise.

218
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:32,711
Come on, bitch.

219
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,114
Till next time, suckers.

220
00:22:37,883 --> 00:22:38,884
Hey,

221
00:22:40,719 --> 00:22:41,854
good game.

222
00:22:41,887 --> 00:22:44,690
Here's a consolation
prize, ladies.

223
00:22:44,723 --> 00:22:45,891
You're all right, Kat.

224
00:22:46,925 --> 00:22:47,993
Thanks for the cancer.

225
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:55,701
Hey, look at you,
making new friends.

226
00:22:55,734 --> 00:22:58,036
Probably a good thing.

227
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,739
Yeah well, see how
long it keeps me alive.

228
00:23:00,772 --> 00:23:03,609
Hey, you're growing on 'em,

229
00:23:03,642 --> 00:23:05,911
but your fists in their
face will do that, too.

230
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:10,849
Can I ask you something?

231
00:23:11,817 --> 00:23:13,151
If it was about the smokes,

232
00:23:13,185 --> 00:23:15,153
I didn't give it to
them to win them over.

233
00:23:15,187 --> 00:23:17,421
Gave it to them
'cause I don't smoke.

234
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:21,026
You're no murderer.

235
00:23:22,928 --> 00:23:24,062
Why are you here?

236
00:23:27,566 --> 00:23:29,902
I was set up by a
local gang leader.

237
00:23:29,935 --> 00:23:31,503
But I'll leave it at that.

238
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:34,506
Less you know, safer you are.

239
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:35,540
Listen,

240
00:23:36,341 --> 00:23:38,677
rumor is there's
a way outta here.

241
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,045
A tunnel.

242
00:23:40,078 --> 00:23:42,648
I'm not sure where but
I know there are drugs

243
00:23:42,681 --> 00:23:44,415
getting in to the
warden from it.

244
00:23:45,617 --> 00:23:48,186
I think it's basement level.

245
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,855
What's down there now?

246
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:50,989
Laundry.

247
00:23:51,023 --> 00:23:52,691
But I only did laundry
for three weeks.

248
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:55,060
That home ec shit ain't for me.

249
00:23:55,093 --> 00:23:56,895
Trash detail down there, too.

250
00:23:56,929 --> 00:23:58,063
Hm, okay.

251
00:23:58,096 --> 00:23:59,430
Well it gives me a start.

252
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:01,667
I've got a plan.

253
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:07,039
So, you're interested
in a job detail?

254
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:08,507
Yeah.

255
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,541
What'd you do on the outside?

256
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:11,076
What do you do?

257
00:24:11,109 --> 00:24:12,210
Fixed bikes.

258
00:24:12,244 --> 00:24:13,211
Like motorcycles.

259
00:24:13,245 --> 00:24:14,646
Mm-hm.

260
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,949
That's not your everyday
female occupation.

261
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:21,186
I've been around bikes my
whole life, so came naturally.

262
00:24:22,721 --> 00:24:24,556
Well, I don't know what
you would do around here

263
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:26,491
that's similar to that, but um,

264
00:24:27,859 --> 00:24:29,127
what do you want?

265
00:24:29,161 --> 00:24:31,930
Well, I worked at a garage.

266
00:24:31,964 --> 00:24:34,232
I'm used to getting
sweat, blood,

267
00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:36,268
grease, oil, out of clothing.

268
00:24:36,301 --> 00:24:38,003
Laundry detail?

269
00:24:38,036 --> 00:24:39,771
Yeah, we could set up laundry.

270
00:24:39,805 --> 00:24:41,106
You mind if I make a phone call?

271
00:24:41,139 --> 00:24:44,977
Oh hey, before that,
I write poetry too.

272
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:46,845
I could try and
freestyle something

273
00:24:46,878 --> 00:24:48,113
while you're on the phone.

274
00:24:48,146 --> 00:24:49,548
Pen, paper?

275
00:24:49,581 --> 00:24:51,717
Yeah, I'd love
to read your work.

276
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,751
Thanks.

277
00:24:56,288 --> 00:24:58,857
Hey Lonnie, we need
to get Kat a job.

278
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:01,093
I was thinking maybe
laundry detail.

279
00:25:02,861 --> 00:25:06,098
I mean there's for sure, you
can squeeze her in, right?

280
00:25:06,131 --> 00:25:07,899
There's gotta be one opening.

281
00:25:07,933 --> 00:25:09,101
Uh-huh.

282
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:10,135
Okay yeah, tonight?

283
00:25:10,168 --> 00:25:11,169
All right.

284
00:25:11,203 --> 00:25:12,270
Thank you.

285
00:25:12,304 --> 00:25:13,505
All right, bye.

286
00:25:14,239 --> 00:25:15,207
Well I got good news.

287
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,641
You got laundry if you want it.

288
00:25:16,675 --> 00:25:17,809
So, you interested?

289
00:25:18,777 --> 00:25:19,778
When can I start?

290
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:20,879
Tonight after dinner.

291
00:25:20,912 --> 00:25:22,547
So um, we'll check
in in a few days

292
00:25:22,581 --> 00:25:23,915
and we'll see how
it's going for ya.

293
00:25:23,949 --> 00:25:25,283
Great, thanks.

294
00:25:25,317 --> 00:25:26,518
No problem.

295
00:25:29,955 --> 00:25:30,956
Thank you.

296
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:39,698
I think
you're a good person,

297
00:25:39,731 --> 00:25:41,266
or at least I hope.

298
00:25:41,299 --> 00:25:43,201
I'm not innocent in life,

299
00:25:43,235 --> 00:25:45,337
but innocent in why I'm here.

300
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:49,207
Don't talk to or trust
anyone in this facility.

301
00:25:49,241 --> 00:25:52,644
They're going to kill me, soon.

302
00:25:52,677 --> 00:25:53,678
I need your help.

303
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,047
Kat down here?

304
00:26:29,081 --> 00:26:30,615
Yeah.

305
00:26:30,649 --> 00:26:32,084
You got mail, sweetie.

306
00:26:32,117 --> 00:26:33,118
Thanks.

307
00:26:35,687 --> 00:26:37,222
Did I get anything?

308
00:26:37,255 --> 00:26:38,924
Let me check.

309
00:26:38,957 --> 00:26:41,226
- Let me check.
- Uh, no.

310
00:26:41,259 --> 00:26:42,227
You aint' got no mail.

311
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,295
Who would send you mail?

312
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,329
My brother, Dean.

313
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:46,798
Please, jackass.

314
00:26:46,832 --> 00:26:48,600
You're the jackass.

315
00:27:16,695 --> 00:27:17,896
Come on, you.

316
00:27:20,432 --> 00:27:21,633
Let's go!

317
00:27:22,434 --> 00:27:24,136
- Come on.
- Pervert!

318
00:27:24,169 --> 00:27:26,004
What the hell?

319
00:27:26,037 --> 00:27:27,038
Go!

320
00:27:32,043 --> 00:27:34,980
You're going to have to
give me something, Vegas.

321
00:27:35,013 --> 00:27:36,047
Something.

322
00:27:37,816 --> 00:27:40,752
Look, I told you I
don't know anything.

323
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:42,254
Nothin' about the new girl.

324
00:27:51,429 --> 00:27:52,430
Okay.

325
00:27:53,465 --> 00:27:54,666
Okay look.

326
00:27:58,003 --> 00:28:00,205
She was asking about
getting a job detail.

327
00:28:00,238 --> 00:28:02,107
She asked me what
I thought was good.

328
00:28:03,041 --> 00:28:05,977
All I know is she's
some fucking biker bitch

329
00:28:07,345 --> 00:28:08,847
and she's in for murder.

330
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,115
- That's all.
- Job detail?

331
00:28:11,082 --> 00:28:12,150
I don't know.

332
00:28:12,184 --> 00:28:13,218
She's bored?

333
00:28:14,352 --> 00:28:16,489
Wants to make some cash?

334
00:28:16,522 --> 00:28:17,889
I don't fucking know.

335
00:28:19,391 --> 00:28:21,793
That's not helpful.

336
00:28:23,395 --> 00:28:24,963
Wait, motherfucker.

337
00:28:26,865 --> 00:28:27,866
There is something.

338
00:28:30,302 --> 00:28:31,504
Word is she's innocent.

339
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:41,046
Here off the record.

340
00:28:42,047 --> 00:28:43,748
Some gangster from upstate.

341
00:28:45,283 --> 00:28:46,751
Go on.

342
00:28:46,785 --> 00:28:49,387
That's all
I know, that's it.

343
00:28:51,122 --> 00:28:52,157
Maybe, wait.

344
00:28:54,527 --> 00:28:55,760
Maybe one thing.

345
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:01,032
Maybe she's a murderer,
maybe she's not.

346
00:29:01,066 --> 00:29:03,935
But you better watch
your fucking back,

347
00:29:03,969 --> 00:29:05,136
because she's tough enough

348
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,839
to turn this place
to dust right up.

349
00:29:36,502 --> 00:29:38,370
Ah, shut up.

350
00:29:49,914 --> 00:29:51,916
Hey, that's too
bad about Vegas.

351
00:30:06,898 --> 00:30:07,899
Enough!

352
00:30:08,634 --> 00:30:10,235
Take her to solitary!

353
00:30:14,205 --> 00:30:15,206
Get off me.

354
00:30:18,043 --> 00:30:19,444
Move it!

355
00:30:31,222 --> 00:30:33,191
Warden, found this on her.

356
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:43,134
Thoughts?

357
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:47,472
Probably a showdown
with one of the inmates.

358
00:30:47,506 --> 00:30:48,507
I don't know.

359
00:30:49,074 --> 00:30:50,942
What do you want us to do?

360
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:52,511
Let's play.

361
00:30:52,545 --> 00:30:54,346
Make sure she's there on time.

362
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:13,278
Surprised to see me, baby?

363
00:34:17,215 --> 00:34:19,117
I'm sure you know by now,

364
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:21,286
Rosie's taken control.

365
00:34:21,319 --> 00:34:23,722
No more Hellcats,
no more Vipers.

366
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:26,057
Now there's just us, baby.

367
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:28,059
Snake?

368
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,461
Relax.

369
00:34:30,496 --> 00:34:32,765
No time for old news now.

370
00:34:32,798 --> 00:34:34,265
Vipers are gone temporarily.

371
00:34:34,299 --> 00:34:36,769
I'm here to take my outfit back.

372
00:34:36,802 --> 00:34:38,169
A few days ago I
followed Rosie in

373
00:34:38,202 --> 00:34:39,772
and who I assumed
to be the warden,

374
00:34:39,805 --> 00:34:41,372
and followed them
back to this place.

375
00:34:41,406 --> 00:34:43,441
There's an old underground
tunnel leading out of here.

376
00:34:43,474 --> 00:34:45,711
It's connected to solitary.

377
00:34:45,744 --> 00:34:49,380
That's good to know,
but I'm not leaving now.

378
00:34:49,414 --> 00:34:50,415
No?

379
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,751
I'm taking down the warden

380
00:34:52,785 --> 00:34:54,587
and I made a promise to someone.

381
00:34:55,621 --> 00:34:56,622
Suit yourself.

382
00:34:57,823 --> 00:35:00,191
I need to gather more information
on Rosie's operations,

383
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,426
get us some leverage.

384
00:35:02,561 --> 00:35:05,196
I'll be back in
two days, 6:00 PM.

385
00:35:05,229 --> 00:35:06,765
Do something to
get into solitary.

386
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,270
Gets too hot around here,
you know the way out.

387
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:15,741
You know I wouldn't leave
you in a place like this.

388
00:35:15,774 --> 00:35:19,143
But when things settle down
and you're on the outside,

389
00:35:19,177 --> 00:35:21,279
we got some unfinished
business between us.

390
00:35:22,915 --> 00:35:24,516
Till then we're a team.

391
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:25,551
Deal?

392
00:35:37,529 --> 00:35:40,899
Doctor, I need you to come
back in 30 minutes, please.

393
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:49,240
Get up.

394
00:35:50,609 --> 00:35:52,377
Get up now.

395
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:54,379
She smashed my
fucking face, man!

396
00:35:54,412 --> 00:35:55,781
Look at this shit!

397
00:35:55,814 --> 00:35:58,484
Shut up and listen carefully.

398
00:35:58,517 --> 00:36:02,488
Kat and two guards were
found unconscious earlier.

399
00:36:02,521 --> 00:36:05,256
Nobody saw anything.

400
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:07,660
I'm warning you,
this is the last time

401
00:36:07,693 --> 00:36:09,862
you go rogue against
my instruction.

402
00:36:09,895 --> 00:36:11,597
Man, I didn't go rogue.

403
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,231
I have nothing to do with this.

404
00:36:13,264 --> 00:36:15,834
You told me not to kill
her, I haven't done shit!

405
00:36:16,702 --> 00:36:17,936
But you can believe this,

406
00:36:19,738 --> 00:36:21,640
payback is fucking coming.

407
00:36:21,674 --> 00:36:24,610
She stays alive, period.

408
00:36:24,643 --> 00:36:27,412
However, I give you
permission to use

409
00:36:27,445 --> 00:36:30,816
whatever means necessary
to find out who did this.

410
00:36:32,383 --> 00:36:33,384
Quickly.

411
00:36:58,376 --> 00:37:01,312
Something's really off here
and I don't know what yet.

412
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:03,482
Kat's confidant
isn't talking either.

413
00:37:04,415 --> 00:37:06,585
Isn't talking, or
doesn't know anything?

414
00:37:08,487 --> 00:37:09,855
Which is it?

415
00:37:09,888 --> 00:37:12,691
It's getting harder to
keep Kat alive here, Rosie.

416
00:37:15,794 --> 00:37:18,597
Well that's exactly
what I'm paying you to do,

417
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:21,033
and a raise could
be in your future.

418
00:37:21,066 --> 00:37:23,602
I have a very important
deal going down.

419
00:37:23,635 --> 00:37:26,471
Which includes the largest
acquisition of product

420
00:37:26,505 --> 00:37:27,740
we've ever had.

421
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:34,445
Kat's dead, she's
buried in your tomb.

422
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,882
The Hellcats that
are in my outfit now,

423
00:37:36,915 --> 00:37:38,484
they think she left them.

424
00:37:38,517 --> 00:37:40,018
Abandoned them.

425
00:37:40,052 --> 00:37:41,887
I don't need them
finding out she died

426
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,790
in some down state prison
for a trigger that I pulled.

427
00:37:45,724 --> 00:37:47,493
Who could be helping her?

428
00:37:47,526 --> 00:37:49,962
Who would put their life
on the line for her?

429
00:37:52,363 --> 00:37:53,364
Only one man.

430
00:37:57,468 --> 00:37:58,904
And he's dead.

431
00:38:43,749 --> 00:38:47,619
Here I thought it was
cats that had nine lives.

432
00:38:47,653 --> 00:38:49,621
You ain't here for
a try out, are ya?

433
00:38:51,089 --> 00:38:52,591
You're here for trouble.

434
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,563
If I was here for trouble
you'd know it already.

435
00:38:57,596 --> 00:38:59,965
Well then,
what can I do for ya?

436
00:38:59,998 --> 00:39:01,465
Kat's down state, why?

437
00:39:02,734 --> 00:39:03,902
It's only Demons now.

438
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:06,605
No place for Hellcats
and Vipers anymore.

439
00:39:08,173 --> 00:39:09,908
We'll see about that.

440
00:39:09,942 --> 00:39:11,510
Mm, Rosie's merged them all.

441
00:39:11,543 --> 00:39:13,444
She's the only game in town.

442
00:39:13,478 --> 00:39:14,646
Kat's a strong woman.

443
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,380
It's better to have
her under lock and key,

444
00:39:16,414 --> 00:39:17,850
know what I mean?

445
00:39:17,883 --> 00:39:18,884
Go on.

446
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:22,020
Kat got set up during a fight.

447
00:39:23,755 --> 00:39:26,725
Fighting for money,
doesn't sound like Kat.

448
00:39:26,758 --> 00:39:28,426
I need something, Max.

449
00:39:28,459 --> 00:39:29,795
Money wasn't for her.

450
00:39:29,828 --> 00:39:32,598
Word is Frank needs the
money, for his shop.

451
00:39:32,631 --> 00:39:34,833
Merger can take a toll
on everyone, Snake,

452
00:39:34,867 --> 00:39:37,736
but Kat coming back
on Rosie's turf,

453
00:39:37,769 --> 00:39:39,504
looking for illegal fights?

454
00:39:39,538 --> 00:39:40,639
Not a smart move.

455
00:39:40,672 --> 00:39:44,408
Rosie doesn't need a strong
girl like that in her back yard.

456
00:39:44,442 --> 00:39:45,844
Next thing you know
she's rallying her girls

457
00:39:45,878 --> 00:39:48,914
and there's a rebellion,
and the Demons are here.

458
00:39:48,947 --> 00:39:51,382
Specially when Rosie's
making bigger deals.

459
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,752
Bigger deals?

460
00:39:53,785 --> 00:39:56,454
She's pushing more product
than you ever could, Snake.

461
00:39:56,488 --> 00:39:57,489
No offense.

462
00:39:59,057 --> 00:40:00,391
None taken, Max.

463
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:02,661
None taken.

464
00:40:03,762 --> 00:40:05,597
Here's what I propose.

465
00:40:05,631 --> 00:40:07,165
You give me the
name of the location

466
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:10,936
where Rosie's pushing
drugs, weapons, whatever.

467
00:40:10,969 --> 00:40:15,173
You give me the name of that
location within five seconds,

468
00:40:15,207 --> 00:40:17,109
or else I kill you
within the next 48 hours

469
00:40:17,142 --> 00:40:19,011
and burn this place
to the ground.

470
00:40:19,978 --> 00:40:21,880
Maybe make it my new clubhouse.

471
00:40:22,948 --> 00:40:24,950
Choose a side, wisely, Max.

472
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,921
Hold on.

473
00:40:30,055 --> 00:40:31,223
Rosie's got a big
deal going soon,

474
00:40:31,256 --> 00:40:33,225
but I don't know the
details on it, man.

475
00:40:33,258 --> 00:40:35,060
All I know is she's
got a lot of product

476
00:40:35,093 --> 00:40:37,095
coming out of that
warehouse downtown.

477
00:40:37,129 --> 00:40:39,398
Now that's a start man, right?

478
00:40:40,232 --> 00:40:41,733
I know your game, Max.

479
00:40:41,767 --> 00:40:42,868
I know you talk.

480
00:40:43,902 --> 00:40:46,672
When you talk to Rosie you
tell her someone was here.

481
00:40:46,705 --> 00:40:48,740
But not me, Snake's dead.

482
00:40:49,975 --> 00:40:51,576
Anything else I should know?

483
00:40:53,545 --> 00:40:56,214
Yeah, something to put
in those memory banks.

484
00:40:56,248 --> 00:40:57,816
The Vipers are back.

485
00:41:25,844 --> 00:41:27,012
Yeah?

486
00:41:27,045 --> 00:41:29,147
Word on the street's
the Vipers are back.

487
00:41:30,983 --> 00:41:32,617
Get out, come back tomorrow.

488
00:41:37,589 --> 00:41:39,257
Who gave you this information?

489
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:40,726
A reliable source.

490
00:41:40,759 --> 00:41:41,893
Watch yourself.

491
00:41:43,862 --> 00:41:44,997
Shit.

492
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:03,548
You looked pretty fine to me,

493
00:42:03,582 --> 00:42:05,017
but I can't say for certain

494
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:07,786
without a more
thorough investigation.

495
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,623
I'll see you in my
exam room tonight.

496
00:42:15,794 --> 00:42:17,662
Solitary, six.

497
00:42:25,771 --> 00:42:27,839
I'm getting scared here, Kat.

498
00:42:27,873 --> 00:42:30,042
Any luck finding the
entrance inside of laundry?

499
00:42:30,075 --> 00:42:35,080
Well, it's not in laundry,
but yeah, I know where it is.

500
00:42:35,247 --> 00:42:36,248
What?

501
00:42:36,281 --> 00:42:37,616
You didn't tell me.

502
00:42:37,649 --> 00:42:39,618
Well, the less
you know the better.

503
00:42:40,952 --> 00:42:43,688
It's just a matter of
time before they kill me.

504
00:42:43,722 --> 00:42:46,091
Relax, they're keeping
me alive for a reason.

505
00:42:47,759 --> 00:42:49,561
That doesn't
mean I'm safe, Kat.

506
00:42:51,029 --> 00:42:52,998
We're on borrowed
time, both of us.

507
00:42:55,233 --> 00:42:57,202
Well I'm finding
out more info tonight.

508
00:43:03,809 --> 00:43:04,943
Get the ball, ladies.

509
00:43:33,071 --> 00:43:35,340
Kat, confinement.

510
00:43:59,865 --> 00:44:01,333
Hey, Mr Buck?

511
00:44:01,366 --> 00:44:02,868
Hey uh, I'm about to
take off for the day

512
00:44:02,901 --> 00:44:05,704
and I remembered you
wanted to discuss your uh,

513
00:44:08,273 --> 00:44:10,342
your, your confidence issues.

514
00:44:14,112 --> 00:44:16,414
Listen, I told
you that in private.

515
00:44:16,448 --> 00:44:17,716
Hey, don't.

516
00:44:17,749 --> 00:44:18,884
That is not something

517
00:44:18,917 --> 00:44:20,318
appropriate to talk
about in public.

518
00:44:20,352 --> 00:44:22,154
Keep your head
down, just listen.

519
00:44:22,187 --> 00:44:23,355
There's a big deal
going down soon.

520
00:44:23,388 --> 00:44:25,157
I need to get more details.

521
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:27,459
You need to leave, like fast.

522
00:44:27,493 --> 00:44:29,761
We'll talk about
this later, but,

523
00:44:29,794 --> 00:44:31,263
in private again, please?

524
00:44:31,296 --> 00:44:32,364
Hang in there.

525
00:44:32,397 --> 00:44:35,267
- Thank you.
- You'll be all right.

526
00:44:43,074 --> 00:44:44,042
Not yet.

527
00:44:44,075 --> 00:44:45,243
I need 24 hours.

528
00:44:46,444 --> 00:44:47,913
High noon, tomorrow.

529
00:44:47,946 --> 00:44:49,848
We meet at the
entrance to the tunnel.

530
00:44:56,489 --> 00:44:59,057
One more thing, I want my bike.

531
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:00,325
Who has it?

532
00:45:00,358 --> 00:45:01,993
Who do you think
I would trust?

533
00:45:58,383 --> 00:46:00,385
Think you have
something of mine, Frank.

534
00:46:01,419 --> 00:46:02,854
I thought you was dead, Snake.

535
00:46:02,887 --> 00:46:03,888
Yeah, I know.

536
00:46:04,856 --> 00:46:07,359
Relax, I'm not here for trouble.

537
00:46:07,392 --> 00:46:10,262
Well when you're around,
there's always trouble, Snake.

538
00:46:10,295 --> 00:46:11,463
Maybe I shed some skin.

539
00:46:12,831 --> 00:46:14,399
That doesn't
change who you are.

540
00:46:15,601 --> 00:46:17,836
The world's different
around here.

541
00:46:17,869 --> 00:46:19,538
Everything's changed.

542
00:46:19,572 --> 00:46:21,239
I done retired.

543
00:46:21,273 --> 00:46:22,440
I done bought this farm.

544
00:46:23,908 --> 00:46:27,345
And sure, I still do
bikes here and there.

545
00:46:27,379 --> 00:46:29,047
For Rosie's gang?

546
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,116
Now you know I don't
ask any questions, Snake.

547
00:46:31,149 --> 00:46:32,183
I just take the money.

548
00:46:32,217 --> 00:46:35,453
That's, that's what I
always liked about you, Frank.

549
00:46:37,188 --> 00:46:38,290
Where's Kat?

550
00:46:38,323 --> 00:46:39,824
She okay?

551
00:46:39,858 --> 00:46:42,327
No, she's locked
up down state.

552
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,496
What?

553
00:46:43,529 --> 00:46:45,030
Rosie set her up.

554
00:46:45,063 --> 00:46:46,331
Why?

555
00:46:46,364 --> 00:46:48,033
She was laying
low for a while.

556
00:46:48,066 --> 00:46:50,503
Came back, made
her presence felt.

557
00:46:50,536 --> 00:46:53,204
Strong woman like Kat,
strong woman like Rosie.

558
00:46:54,472 --> 00:46:56,308
There's not room enough
for both of them.

559
00:46:56,341 --> 00:46:58,143
Now you know Kat's
always been clean.

560
00:46:58,176 --> 00:46:59,177
You know that.

561
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:02,314
Kat's in trouble, Frank.

562
00:47:06,985 --> 00:47:07,986
Follow me.

563
00:47:19,565 --> 00:47:20,566
Hey Snake.

564
00:47:33,579 --> 00:47:34,580
Hey.

565
00:47:35,648 --> 00:47:36,848
How can I help?

566
00:48:16,689 --> 00:48:18,289
Rosie told us this job was
soon.

567
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:20,291
Can you clarify that.

568
00:48:21,292 --> 00:48:22,394
Means soon.

569
00:48:22,427 --> 00:48:23,928
That's all you need to know.

570
00:48:32,303 --> 00:48:33,905
Go check that out.

571
00:48:39,712 --> 00:48:42,481
Look, it's a
shit ton of product

572
00:48:42,515 --> 00:48:44,149
we're covering for you guys.

573
00:48:44,182 --> 00:48:45,651
I need to know how close it is.

574
00:48:49,755 --> 00:48:52,157
We ain't playing,
motherfucker.

575
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:53,992
Answer him.

576
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,100
Where's the party at?

577
00:49:38,136 --> 00:49:39,137
Bitch.

578
00:49:40,104 --> 00:49:41,339
No.

579
00:49:41,372 --> 00:49:42,974
Maybe I'll go invite myself.

580
00:50:01,326 --> 00:50:02,327
Yeah?

581
00:50:03,127 --> 00:50:05,263
You need to be
on point with this.

582
00:50:05,296 --> 00:50:08,333
I can't stress the
importance of this deal.

583
00:50:08,366 --> 00:50:10,235
It's under control
and on schedule.

584
00:50:11,537 --> 00:50:13,338
Be ready in 48.

585
00:50:13,371 --> 00:50:14,372
Watch your back.

586
00:50:17,408 --> 00:50:18,644
Let's get back to work.

587
00:50:56,381 --> 00:50:58,216
Dirty cops.

588
00:50:58,249 --> 00:51:00,451
I know I can always count
on them to be there.

589
00:51:00,486 --> 00:51:01,620
Feel that?

590
00:51:01,654 --> 00:51:02,821
I need quick answers.

591
00:51:03,656 --> 00:51:05,824
When's the next deal?
Who's it with?

592
00:51:05,858 --> 00:51:07,158
Bitch,
she'll kill you.

593
00:51:07,191 --> 00:51:09,093
I'll take my
chances, three seconds.

594
00:51:10,461 --> 00:51:12,363
Some buyer from the southeast.

595
00:51:12,397 --> 00:51:13,832
I don't have a name man.

596
00:51:13,866 --> 00:51:15,601
They'll fucking kill you, too.

597
00:51:15,634 --> 00:51:17,670
Soon they'll be
doing business with me.

598
00:51:28,279 --> 00:51:30,281
No please, continue
what you're doing.

599
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:34,185
I haven't seen you
in a while, Snake.

600
00:51:34,218 --> 00:51:35,420
I heard you were.

601
00:51:35,453 --> 00:51:36,454
Yeah.

602
00:51:37,088 --> 00:51:38,624
Rosie's not unreasonable.

603
00:51:39,558 --> 00:51:40,626
I bet she'd cut ya in.

604
00:51:41,594 --> 00:51:44,195
Well that's mighty
generous of Rosie now.

605
00:51:44,228 --> 00:51:46,197
I will seriously consider that.

606
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:50,903
Better than being
cut out permanently.

607
00:51:50,936 --> 00:51:52,605
Speaking of Rosie,

608
00:51:54,372 --> 00:51:55,440
where can I find her?

609
00:52:10,321 --> 00:52:11,757
Bring up your right hand, slow.

610
00:52:24,637 --> 00:52:25,771
Now your left.

611
00:52:29,942 --> 00:52:31,309
I don't think so, Rosie.

612
00:52:31,342 --> 00:52:32,343
If you'll excuse me.

613
00:52:40,886 --> 00:52:43,555
Normally I like this kind
of party, but not tonight.

614
00:52:59,004 --> 00:53:02,173
Here I thought
Kat had nine lives.

615
00:53:03,542 --> 00:53:05,678
Speaking of Kat, why?

616
00:53:08,246 --> 00:53:09,247
Times change.

617
00:53:10,716 --> 00:53:11,850
Look around, Snake.

618
00:53:13,384 --> 00:53:15,688
If you weren't as
stubborn as you are,

619
00:53:15,721 --> 00:53:17,188
you actually might like it.

620
00:53:18,657 --> 00:53:19,658
I doubt it.

621
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,762
You know, Kat's replaceable.

622
00:53:24,763 --> 00:53:25,764
Expendable.

623
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:28,934
It's time you see this.

624
00:53:31,003 --> 00:53:32,738
This could be
mutually beneficial.

625
00:53:40,646 --> 00:53:44,817
You know, you two are
seriously fucked up.

626
00:53:46,018 --> 00:53:48,921
And now that Kat's
put away, for good,

627
00:53:49,888 --> 00:53:54,459
so I just unfucked your
fucked up relationship.

628
00:53:54,493 --> 00:53:55,494
You're welcome.

629
00:53:57,663 --> 00:53:58,664
Guess what I got?

630
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:09,908
You know I like what you've done

631
00:54:09,942 --> 00:54:11,810
with my place since
I've been gone.

632
00:54:12,911 --> 00:54:14,046
Yeah, stay out of my way

633
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:15,714
and you'll see what
I can really do.

634
00:54:17,015 --> 00:54:18,416
Sure.

635
00:54:18,449 --> 00:54:19,885
60 for you, 40 for me?

636
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:28,594
90 me, 10 you, and I don't
put a price on your head.

637
00:54:28,627 --> 00:54:29,762
I can be so generous.

638
00:54:29,795 --> 00:54:31,597
Every one percenter
within striking distance

639
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:34,533
will come and
exterminate you for me.

640
00:54:34,566 --> 00:54:37,069
Look Rosie, I don't
have some of your drugs,

641
00:54:37,102 --> 00:54:39,505
I have all your drugs.

642
00:54:41,372 --> 00:54:44,576
We'll meet in two days and
I'll bring every bag of it,

643
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:46,879
provided Kat's alive
and in one piece.

644
00:54:48,412 --> 00:54:51,315
If I even suspect
you're tailing me,

645
00:54:51,349 --> 00:54:53,819
if I suspect you're pressing me,

646
00:54:53,852 --> 00:54:55,419
I'll torch every gram of it.

647
00:54:57,556 --> 00:54:58,891
I'll be in touch.

648
00:55:24,583 --> 00:55:25,584
You're up.

649
00:55:36,728 --> 00:55:38,530
You have a visitor.

650
00:56:05,657 --> 00:56:08,359
Kat, I didn't expect
to see you in here.

651
00:56:11,897 --> 00:56:13,131
You know when you're in trouble

652
00:56:14,233 --> 00:56:17,636
you're supposed to come see
me, not anyone else, me.

653
00:56:20,471 --> 00:56:21,472
I know.

654
00:56:22,975 --> 00:56:23,976
You know?

655
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:28,379
Then why you sitting there
and I'm sitting over here?

656
00:56:29,548 --> 00:56:31,650
I messed up, Frank.

657
00:56:31,683 --> 00:56:33,619
I wanted to make
some quick cash.

658
00:56:33,652 --> 00:56:35,453
Heard there were
fights going down.

659
00:56:36,922 --> 00:56:38,156
In Rosie's back yard?

660
00:56:39,791 --> 00:56:42,527
I was doing it for
your business, Frank.

661
00:56:42,561 --> 00:56:43,962
I know the yard is hurting.

662
00:56:45,463 --> 00:56:47,699
That's my business,
I'll manage.

663
00:56:49,601 --> 00:56:51,435
It's our problem.

664
00:56:52,905 --> 00:56:56,508
Look, there's no
one to trust here.

665
00:56:56,541 --> 00:57:00,646
I'm sure that they're
probably listening now,

666
00:57:00,679 --> 00:57:01,980
so watch what you say.

667
00:57:03,782 --> 00:57:05,117
I got something to show you.

668
00:57:32,110 --> 00:57:33,178
You got that?

669
00:57:36,848 --> 00:57:38,183
It was nice seeing you, Kat.

670
00:57:39,584 --> 00:57:40,719
I'll see you soon.

671
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,108
Zoom in.

672
00:58:03,141 --> 00:58:04,142
Enhance that.

673
00:58:06,578 --> 00:58:08,080
Find out what that paper says.

674
00:58:10,916 --> 00:58:13,018
It doesn't really
work like that, ma'am.

675
00:58:14,019 --> 00:58:15,120
Do it anyway.

676
00:59:43,975 --> 00:59:44,976
Lunch.

677
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:58,090
I'll get that fucker,
believe it, you'll see.

678
00:59:58,123 --> 01:00:00,058
Fuck you, Kat!

679
01:00:08,066 --> 01:00:09,234
We're cool now, right?

680
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:19,911
Orders, Warden?

681
01:00:20,979 --> 01:00:22,881
Confinement, both of them.

682
01:00:23,882 --> 01:00:25,650
Infirmary first for the other?

683
01:00:25,684 --> 01:00:27,752
Take them both to
confinement, now!

684
01:00:32,757 --> 01:00:34,826
We're going to make this quick.

685
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:39,798
All these shenanigans are
making me anxious, impatient.

686
01:00:40,932 --> 01:00:43,401
I'm going to ask
you direct questions

687
01:00:43,435 --> 01:00:48,640
and I expect short,
direct answers.

688
01:00:49,808 --> 01:00:52,911
I warn you, I can
become impatient.

689
01:00:52,944 --> 01:00:54,746
I need a fucking doctor!

690
01:00:57,382 --> 01:00:59,918
Rosie, whatever
you know of her,

691
01:00:59,951 --> 01:01:03,755
drugs, meetings,
associates, talk.

692
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:09,261
Talk, Kat!

693
01:01:11,329 --> 01:01:12,430
Drop it!

694
01:01:19,938 --> 01:01:20,939
Now!

695
01:01:23,275 --> 01:01:24,743
You, unlock her.

696
01:01:28,013 --> 01:01:30,415
You, drop your
gear and sit down.

697
01:01:38,423 --> 01:01:42,961
Okay, now cuff yourself to
your boyfriend over there.

698
01:01:43,929 --> 01:01:44,930
Move it!

699
01:01:46,198 --> 01:01:47,732
Now what, Kat?

700
01:01:47,766 --> 01:01:49,801
Where exactly are
you going to go?

701
01:01:50,869 --> 01:01:52,270
We're leaving.

702
01:01:52,304 --> 01:01:53,705
There's no where to run.

703
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,107
I don't need to run.

704
01:02:14,859 --> 01:02:17,262
Can I help you
with something, doc?

705
01:02:19,931 --> 01:02:21,299
You know, I'm pretty sure

706
01:02:21,333 --> 01:02:23,335
this violated patient
confidentiality laws.

707
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:04,869
No, get the fuck off of me!

708
01:04:04,903 --> 01:04:06,237
Get off of me!

709
01:04:26,659 --> 01:04:29,127
Get that bitch!

710
01:04:32,464 --> 01:04:33,865
Thanks, Phil.

711
01:04:40,606 --> 01:04:42,207
You shouldn't be here.

712
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:44,943
I don't want you to get
wrapped up into this.

713
01:04:44,976 --> 01:04:46,645
Hey, don't worry about me.

714
01:04:46,679 --> 01:04:47,879
I have a plan, okay?

715
01:04:50,683 --> 01:04:52,016
So this is it, isn't it?

716
01:04:54,018 --> 01:04:57,055
You are gonna make a
great doctor one day.

717
01:04:57,088 --> 01:04:58,089
I just know it.

718
01:05:40,398 --> 01:05:41,399
Frank!

719
01:05:46,204 --> 01:05:47,372
I'm sorry.

720
01:05:47,405 --> 01:05:49,274
Are you gonna make me
go through this again?

721
01:05:50,643 --> 01:05:53,445
Kat, you're the only
family I have, you know?

722
01:05:53,478 --> 01:05:54,480
Sorry.

723
01:05:58,751 --> 01:05:59,951
Frank,

724
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:01,720
get them safe.

725
01:06:03,589 --> 01:06:05,123
What about the warden?

726
01:06:05,156 --> 01:06:06,391
It's taken care of.

727
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:09,994
Are you going to Rosie?

728
01:06:10,028 --> 01:06:11,029
Yeah.

729
01:06:11,062 --> 01:06:12,397
To give her back her drugs.

730
01:06:14,299 --> 01:06:16,034
Yeah, about that.

731
01:06:16,067 --> 01:06:17,068
I changed my mind.

732
01:06:17,101 --> 01:06:18,336
I think I'm gonna keep her drugs

733
01:06:18,369 --> 01:06:20,205
and then I'm gonna show
up to her little meeting

734
01:06:20,238 --> 01:06:23,408
and I'm gonna take out anybody
that shows up with her.

735
01:06:23,441 --> 01:06:24,577
Vipers are back, baby.

736
01:06:25,744 --> 01:06:27,513
You're not going alone.

737
01:06:27,546 --> 01:06:28,547
I owe you now.

738
01:06:33,619 --> 01:06:34,653
Kat.

739
01:06:34,687 --> 01:06:36,755
After this, we're even.

740
01:06:36,789 --> 01:06:38,056
No more bad blood.

741
01:06:40,659 --> 01:06:42,994
There's tools in the
barn if you need 'em.

742
01:06:47,566 --> 01:06:50,001
I actually see this
going really well.

743
01:07:08,286 --> 01:07:09,287
Oh God.

744
01:07:38,316 --> 01:07:39,450
I'm glad I missed.

745
01:08:27,933 --> 01:08:29,133
Tools?

746
01:08:35,473 --> 01:08:36,675
Tools.

747
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:56,795
I don't see what
belongs to me here.

748
01:08:59,565 --> 01:09:00,833
You know it's funny, Rosie.

749
01:09:00,866 --> 01:09:02,534
I leave after a little hiatus

750
01:09:02,568 --> 01:09:05,537
and come back and I don't
have what's mine, either.

751
01:09:06,572 --> 01:09:07,606
But that changes now.

752
01:09:08,807 --> 01:09:10,743
You're playing your
cards wrong here.

753
01:09:26,324 --> 01:09:28,861
But I knew you'd fuck things up.

754
01:09:30,261 --> 01:09:32,163
Fuck it up for yourself, anyway.

755
01:09:36,401 --> 01:09:38,537
What, a waste.

756
01:10:42,634 --> 01:10:44,235
It's too bad, blondie,

757
01:10:45,470 --> 01:10:47,539
we could have made a
lot of money together.

758
01:12:58,003 --> 01:12:59,171
I'd like to cut you to pieces

759
01:12:59,204 --> 01:13:03,008
and leave you lying here
baking under the sun.

760
01:13:03,041 --> 01:13:07,946
Vultures come, wolves come,
it's the way you deserve to go.

761
01:13:09,615 --> 01:13:12,718
Normally I see the value of
every low life around here,

762
01:13:12,751 --> 01:13:15,921
but you, even with
all your value,

763
01:13:16,889 --> 01:13:20,158
you're dangerous, and I like it.

764
01:13:20,192 --> 01:13:21,093
But how long?

765
01:13:21,126 --> 01:13:23,695
How long till your next
little revolution here?

766
01:13:24,796 --> 01:13:27,398
How long till you
try to rise up again?

767
01:13:35,774 --> 01:13:37,075
Finish this.

768
01:13:37,109 --> 01:13:39,011
Not in cold blood, Snake.

769
01:13:39,044 --> 01:13:40,946
Your way of life isn't my way.

770
01:13:45,784 --> 01:13:49,453
If you were doing it her way,
you'd be locked up forever.

771
01:13:49,488 --> 01:13:51,823
No Frank, no life, no hope.

772
01:13:51,857 --> 01:13:52,858
Look at her.

773
01:13:53,959 --> 01:13:55,661
Darn it, look at her.

774
01:13:55,694 --> 01:13:57,596
Let that image burn in.

775
01:13:58,563 --> 01:13:59,731
You know why?

776
01:13:59,765 --> 01:14:00,899
'Cause she'd do it again.

777
01:14:05,737 --> 01:14:06,738
Do it, Kat.

778
01:14:09,007 --> 01:14:10,542
Do it.

779
01:14:40,138 --> 01:14:42,007
You did the right thing.

780
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:43,041
Proud of you.

781
01:14:44,743 --> 01:14:45,744
Hey.

782
01:14:47,746 --> 01:14:49,614
I'm going to get Vegas.

783
01:14:49,648 --> 01:14:51,249
I trust I can leave
you two, right?

784
01:15:00,258 --> 01:15:05,197
So I'm thinking me and you
have some unfinished business.

785
01:15:06,331 --> 01:15:07,866
What do we do now?

786
01:15:07,899 --> 01:15:09,167
I won't live this life.

787
01:15:10,135 --> 01:15:11,737
But I won't stand in your way.

788
01:15:14,006 --> 01:15:15,640
I won't run forever.

789
01:15:22,748 --> 01:15:24,282
What if you could?

790
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:29,721
Hey.

791
01:16:25,121 --> 01:16:30,121
