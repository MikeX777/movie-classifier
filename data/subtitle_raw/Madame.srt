00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:08,802
AUGUST 9 1792

2
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:12,311
"KlNG LOUIS XVI IS STILL SITTING
ON HIS MOTH-EATEN THRONE.

3
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:15,746
THE PEOPLE OF PARIS ARE
GETTING READY TO OVERTHROW IT."

4
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:26,246
The Austrians come to the King's rescue!
They threaten to burn Paris!

5
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,913
The people demand the King's removal!

6
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,583
Ask for your copy of "L'Ami du people"!

7
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:38,892
- Catherine!
- Yes?

8
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:41,490
You coming?
We're taking the Tuileries.

9
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:45,265
Thanks, but l already took the Bastille,
and that's enough for me. Best of luck!

10
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:48,102
Beautiful days lie ahead.

11
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:00,618
- Shit!
- What happened?

12
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:05,013
Push harder!

13
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:07,559
What do you have in those arms?
Here.

14
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,185
Come on. Let's do this!

15
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:12,129
It's a good thing I'm here.

16
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:13,597
Come on, kids.

17
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:20,268
It fights back!
It's a monarchist cannon.

18
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,170
You, back there, the sculptor--

19
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,303
have you finished
kneading the clay, Michelangelo?

20
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:29,007
It's not clay, it's marble.

21
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,380
Well, mind yours
and leave mine alone.

22
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:34,011
I don't like people getting too close
with their hands.

23
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:36,248
Higher, l said. Higher.

24
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:39,314
There.
You wanted it, you got it.

25
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,153
I'm considering starting over
for the same price.

26
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:45,527
Next time it'll cost you more.

27
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:48,829
I didn't do it on purpose. It's not
my fault you have such a nice bottom.

28
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:51,268
lt's not my fault
you have such nice cheeks.

29
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,101
Thanks for helping out.

30
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,472
At your service, citizen.
And no hard feelings.

31
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,204
lf it swells up, put a compress on it.

32
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:01,611
lf it gets as big as your beauty,
my head will be like this!

33
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,979
Hey, enough of that already!

34
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,211
Let the rebels through.

35
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:09,119
- Long live the sans-culottes!
- Long live the sans-culottes!

36
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,157
Come on, Marie.
We're going back to the shop.

37
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:13,886
lf l were you, l'd avoid the Tuileries.

38
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,758
There's sure to be
some commotion down there.

39
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,558
All the more reason to go and see!

40
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:22,192
# Let us dance the Carmagnole,
long live the sound. #

41
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:28,971
We came here from Marseille to fight.
What do we do now?

42
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:32,068
- Do we take the Tuileries or not?
- The Tuileries!

43
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:34,409
There are over 2000 Swiss guards there,
armed to the teeth.

44
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,415
Switzerland this, Switzerland that.
What's France then, shit?

45
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:42,246
- Death to the tyrant!
- Down with the King!

46
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:43,414
Down!

47
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:47,285
Death to the tyrant!

48
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:51,355
Down!

49
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:11,306
lt's Sans-Gene.
What are you doing here?

50
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:15,047
The same as you. l'm watching the Swiss,
and it's not a pretty sight.

51
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:18,488
lf they like the king so much,
they should take him with them.

52
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:19,855
You're right.

53
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,266
Catherine, look!

54
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:35,171
Hey, hurry up!

55
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,373
What's going on?
Are shots being fired in my courtyard?

56
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,982
A cannon!
They put a cannon in my courtyard!

57
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:49,146
Where do you think
you're going, citizen?

58
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,156
He's asking me where l'm going!

59
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,350
To my place, of course!

60
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,450
Prove it. Do you have
a certificate of accommodation?

61
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:57,087
You have a certificate of stupidity
on your face.

62
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:58,755
Respect the revolution, would you?

63
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:00,696
This idiot would skewer me.

64
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,997
Sergeant Lefebvre's orders.
You're not coming through.

65
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:06,197
- And where is Sergeant Lefebvre?
- Over there. The tall, quiet one.

66
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:09,104
l've gotten through, you see? ldiot!

67
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:11,109
All right, now try to get out.

68
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:14,840
Those vandals, how could they?
Look at this mess!

69
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:16,541
You couldn't stop them
from getting in?

70
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,083
They didn't ask for our opinion.

71
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,881
Use the tubs to move the dirt.

72
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:23,979
- Hey, who's in charge here?
- The people.

73
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:27,993
This is my courtyard. l'm the people
here. And the people are sovereign.

74
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:30,859
Take your little cannon back
to where you found it.

75
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,262
You have five minutes.
And one minute to get out of here.

76
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,767
Move, citizen.
Can't you see you're in the way?

77
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,530
l guess l'm feeling too at home now.

78
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,503
Fricasse! Get rid
of the citizen for me.

79
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,472
We'll see who
gets rid of whom. There!

80
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:48,343
lt's you. What are you doing here?

81
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:50,644
And you? Did you choose
my courtyard on purpose?

82
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:53,982
- Your courtyard?
- Precisely. You're in my space, here.

83
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:56,419
Well then, everything's all right.

84
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:58,013
No, it's not.

85
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:02,391
Go on, don't stay there.

86
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:05,397
Go back home and behave yourself.
Always obey your superiors.

87
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:09,561
l'll find you a superior, and we'll see
who gets rid of whom. Here!

88
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,737
Watch my shop, l'll be right back.

89
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:32,490
My little Bonaparte, l'm so glad
you're here. l need a big favor.

90
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,857
- What is it this time?
- Patriots put a cannon in my courtyard.

91
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:38,453
- What?
- Yes, a cannon. And they won't leave.

92
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:40,624
Tell them to move it. You're
an officer, they'll listen to you.

93
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,395
What do the patriots
want with a cannon?

94
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:44,834
- To fire it, of course.
- On whom?

95
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,065
On the Tuileries. Let's go.
Where's your jacket? There.

96
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,165
What do they want to do,
expel the king?

97
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,040
- And replace him with whom?
- Not with you, of course!

98
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:54,602
You should be happy to host them.

99
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,080
You applaud when they march
on the street.

100
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,641
On the street, yes,
but not in my courtyard.

101
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:03,416
The French-- you're all the same.
The revolution passes by, you applaud.

102
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:07,587
But if it wants to come in,
you slam the door in its face.

103
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:11,187
You don't invite the revolution over,
it could break a vase.

104
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:15,257
- All you do is talk. Let's go.
- l'll tell your patriots to go to hell.

105
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:19,903
- What is it now?
- That's no reason to burn my supper.

106
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:24,671
Hurry up.
Your sword. You never know. Here.

107
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:34,150
Come. Come.

108
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,916
Go on, little Lieutenant,
l'll back you up.

109
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:39,549
Use your sword
to get these loudmouths out of here.

110
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,287
- You'll be rid of them in five minutes.
- Let the lieutenant through!

111
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:46,525
Look, reinforcements.
lt's a gunner. Perfect timing.

112
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,794
Get up, Blanchet.
Let the captain through.

113
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,665
Let the general through.

114
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,499
They don't know
what's in store for them.

115
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,665
Who's in charge here?
There must be a post commander.

116
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,207
- l am.
- Yes, of course.

117
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:57,708
We're organized. Sergeant.

118
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,404
- Hello, Citizen Lieutenant.
- Hello.

119
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,676
Providence sent you.
We need a gun layer.

120
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,375
All you have to do is command.

121
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,180
Go ahead, command them
so we can have a laugh.

122
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:08,686
What do you expect to do
with this cannon?

123
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:11,917
Blow the Tuileries up to see what lies
behind it. Not a bad position, eh?

124
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:15,620
Yes, the first shot will send
the archbishop right up into the sky.

125
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,788
First the priests, then the king!

126
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,422
- Long live the nation!
- Long live the nation!

127
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,932
This thing can't stay here.

128
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,161
- Bravo!
- Long live the lieutenant!

129
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,227
You don't have enough recoil.

130
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:28,239
- What should we do?
- Let me see here.

131
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:32,374
The cannon, here.

132
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:35,573
- What do you mean, here? You're crazy!
- She's right, the gate's in the way.

133
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:39,482
- lf the gate's in the way, take it off!
- Yes, that's it! Take the gate off!

134
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:42,282
Leave the gate alone!

135
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,324
No, you're crazy!

136
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:49,361
- Leave the gate alone, you savages! No!
- Come on, citizen.

137
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:53,598
Let go of me, you brutes.
You big monkey!

138
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,463
- Let us work.
- Vandals!

139
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:59,301
- My word, she bit me!
- Calm or l'll squash you like a snail.

140
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:03,001
You're a snail. What kind of shell
are you trailing along? You!

141
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:05,305
- Again.
- You, Lieutenant of cannibals,

142
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,936
is this your idea
of telling them to go to hell?

143
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,174
Yes. Good luck, citizens.

144
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,648
No, either you stay here
or you take the cannon away.

145
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,515
Take the cannon away? You're crazy.
The lieutenant will stay with us.

146
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,782
l'm sorry,
but my business here is done.

147
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:19,017
What? Where are you going?

148
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:20,422
Are you for or against the revolution?

149
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:24,054
Me? l'm for the artillery.

150
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,997
Don't run off like that.
lt would be too easy, Bonaparte.

151
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,500
Not Bonaparte.
Buonaparte with a ''U.''

152
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,231
Yes, with a ''U.''
That's what l thought.

153
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:36,071
Go on, go sleep.
We don't need you for the revolution.

154
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,905
We'll do it ourselves.

155
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,517
By the order
of the Commune of Paris,

156
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,052
the assault will be launched
tomorrow morning.

157
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:49,280
- Yes.
- Alarms will sound the time of battle.

158
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,516
Stay on guard until then.
Long live the nation!

159
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,320
- Long live the nation!
- Long live the nation!

160
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:56,691
- You're staying until tomorrow morning?
- You heard him.

161
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,195
- Here?
- Here and there, yes.

162
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,390
- Everyone?
- Everyone.

163
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:02,593
You really think l'm spending
the night alone with 18 sans-culottes?

164
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:06,331
No, you won't be all alone.
l'm staying with you.

165
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:07,997
- Me too!
- Thank you,

166
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:09,837
but let's skip the formalities.

167
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:14,073
Don't let them near you
on the pretense of taking the Tuileries.

168
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:44,468
- No!
- l'm married but that's not a reason.

169
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:47,944
l'm not married,
but that's not a reason either.

170
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,982
Timid virgins, for you,
the triumphant revolution

171
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:52,040
will mean liberty, all liberties.

172
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:56,111
lf one day you want to marry
an educated, good-looking man

173
00:10:56,188 --> 00:11:00,056
who likes order and virtue, like me,
for example, just to give you an idea,

174
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:03,220
all it takes is mutual consent
and we'll be man and wife.

175
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:07,288
That's revolution, that's liberty.
That's universal happiness.

176
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:09,300
Long live the nation!

177
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,641
Citizen Fricasse.

178
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:22,579
l swear, l'd rather take you
than the Tuileries.

179
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,673
That might prove more difficult.

180
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,076
Here. You won't go into battle
with a shirt full of holes.

181
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:54,806
The bullets will go through them.

182
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,781
- A pretty shirt with lace.
- You'll fancy yourself an aristocrat.

183
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,047
You'll call out, ''Long live the king!''
and ''Down with the nation!''

184
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,021
- You're just jealous.
- What will your customers say?

185
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,422
Nothing at all.
They all left without paying.

186
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:09,859
With a shirt like this, you don't want
to get yourself killed anymore.

187
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,726
Serve yourselves. Here.

188
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,924
- Hey, you. Catch.
- Thank you.

189
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,967
- Here.
- And me?

190
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,468
lf you can't have
the skin of aristocrats,

191
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:18,935
you can at least have their shirts.

192
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,835
Look at how pretty l am.

193
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:28,146
- This is for you, you big brute.
- What will l look like in this?

194
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:32,378
Like a man in a shirt. Are you afraid
your wife will ask where you got it?

195
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:34,146
l don't have a wife.

196
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:38,486
Unfortunately.

197
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,957
So, your gate.

198
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,653
Hey!

199
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:44,195
Yes?

200
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,858
After we take the Tuileries,
l'll put it back in place.

201
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,401
- Are you still thinking about that?
- Fernand!

202
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:55,168
Look at the state
l find you in, lazybones.

203
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,072
Listen, Sophie, l'll explain.

204
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:59,771
There's no need.
One look at you says it all:

205
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:03,508
a courtesan who looks
like a girl from the Royal Palace;

206
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:05,482
And he, a family man.

207
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,985
ls that what your revolution is about?
Looking good?

208
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:11,022
Would you come home immediately?

209
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:14,491
But, Sophie, l can't. l'm a rebel,
l have to take the Tuileries.

210
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,155
There are others.
They'll take the Tuileries without you.

211
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,061
Were you burned?

212
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,535
Citizen Lefebvre, your presence
is requested. Come quick.

213
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:32,842
- l'm going out.
- l see that.

214
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:42,448
- Commune de Paris, how many are you?
- 18.

215
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:43,988
- How many guns?
- Four.

216
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:46,183
- That's not very much.
- We'll manage.

217
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:49,386
Go to sleep, l'll keep watch.

218
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:10,445
- lt's stuffy in there.
- lt's true.

219
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:14,043
- Are you keeping watch?
- Yes.

220
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,883
- lt's a long wait, isn't it?
- lt depends.

221
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,395
- What are you waiting for?
- The alarm.

222
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:26,658
You have get-togethers.

223
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:28,359
They're necessary.

224
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,700
At least they're talkative.

225
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:35,604
- Can you hear what they're saying?
- Yes.

226
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:40,071
- l have a cat.
- No. And you talk to him?

227
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:42,238
Yes, often.

228
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,017
l have a room at 16 rue de l'Arbre-Sec.

229
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:50,746
Why are you telling me that?

230
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:54,623
lf l were to get killed,
would you take care of my cat?

231
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:57,184
What an idea.
You don't just die like that.

232
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:03,524
Her name is Therese,
it's a female cat.

233
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:07,538
My name is Catherine.
And yours?

234
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:10,234
Francois.

235
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:16,274
What is it?
Why are you looking at me like that?

236
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,145
lf l were to get killed--

237
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:21,550
Again! You can't die twice in a row.

238
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,282
lf l were to get killed, my head--

239
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,950
- What?
- Would you remember my head?

240
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:34,499
Your head. lt's like laundry,

241
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,534
l'll mark it so l recognize it.

242
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,376
Long live the nation!

243
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:45,468
Long live the nation!

244
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:48,672
Long live the revolution!

245
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:52,615
Down with the king!
Long live the nation!

246
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:55,415
Long live the nation!
Down with the king!

247
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,737
Long live the nation!

248
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:43,123
All right, enough of that.

249
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:47,002
Everyone to their posts.
Fill up the cannon. Fricasse!

250
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:53,636
That's fine, stay where you are.
l'll light the wick myself.

251
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:54,906
- Blanchet!
- Yes?

252
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,447
Move the citizens back.

253
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,006
- Prevent them from coming through.
- Go on, move back!

254
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:00,483
lt won't be a loss
for everyone, right?

255
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:03,350
- Yes.
- Watch out in the front!

256
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:10,721
Leave the cannon there,
it's useless.

257
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,661
Go on, take your weapons.

258
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,699
Are you coming, Fricasse?
What are you waiting for?

259
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,359
l was waiting for you
to fire the cannon.

260
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,130
That happened
a long time ago, you idiot!

261
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,830
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

262
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:21,463
- Did you hear anything?
- No.

263
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,909
Okay, stay there. l'll go
deal with the king, and l'll be back.

264
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,707
Lefebvre!

265
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,407
You didn't think
l'd leave like that, did you?

266
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:30,539
- Promise me.
- Yes.

267
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:33,585
And if someone does get killed, it won't
be me. l'll be the one to tell you.

268
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:36,052
Stay here.
Don't be reckless, now's not the time.

269
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:24,719
Women to the back.
To the back!

270
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:26,923
You always have to mix in
with the men.

271
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,628
You're completely crazy.
lt's a real slaughterhouse over there.

272
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,116
Catherine. They're firing
from all sides. That was a close call.

273
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,283
Citizen Fouche,
what are you doing here?

274
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,918
- Taking cover. lmagine that.
- Yes, waiting for this to pass.

275
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:57,359
Why aren't you
down there with them?

276
00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:01,024
l don't have a weapon. Besides,
l'm a representative of the people.

277
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:03,124
My place is at the Assembly,
with the nation.

278
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,830
- Why aren't you at the Assembly?
- l'll go there straightaway,

279
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,701
but l do have to get there
in one piece.

280
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,570
All it takes is for a bullet
to miss its mark.

281
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:12,474
My life belongs to the nation.
l don't have the right to dispose of it.

282
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,375
l think you can go now.

283
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:41,665
# Arise children of the fatherland #

284
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:45,574
# The day of glory has arrived. #

285
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:20,641
Marcel, go back home!
Go right now or l'll call your father.

286
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:24,876
These kids! We haven't been able to keep
them in since we took the Tuileries.

287
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,586
So, Francois--

288
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,721
l don't like it
when you call me Francois.

289
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:15,995
- Why not?
- l don't know, it's just a thought,

290
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:18,468
but everyone
can be called Francois.

291
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:20,164
As for Lefebvre...

292
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:24,766
For me, there's only one Francois
and one Lefebvre, and they're the same.

293
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,607
And l have him all to myself.

294
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:31,174
What did you want to tell me?

295
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:34,116
lt slipped my mind.

296
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:43,818
So, Therese, are you happy with me?

297
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:51,261
Little Menard is taking piano lessons.

298
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:55,300
Sunday.

299
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:02,337
You want to go for a stroll in Creil?
We could take the stagecoach.

300
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:06,248
Yes, we could invite
Fricasse and Heloiise to come along.

301
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:11,551
Sunday. That's in five days.

302
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:17,692
Say, Lefebvre,
you want to go right away?

303
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:19,822
And not go back into battle?

304
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,196
Not right away. Soon.

305
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:25,964
l don't want us to part like this.
Because now, without you--

306
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:29,234
- Weren't you all alone before?
- Yes, almost.

307
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:32,435
But l didn't think about it.
l didn't know you existed.

308
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:35,947
But now you're on one side
and l'm on the other.

309
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:39,313
lt would leave a big void,
you understand?

310
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:42,814
My Lefebvre.

311
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:46,119
My Francois Lefebvre,
my sergeant, my superior.

312
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:53,621
l thought things would calm down
after the Tuileries.

313
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:56,565
Me too. But it's not settled.

314
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:01,398
The whole world is against us,
and all because we want to be free.

315
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:04,533
And don't the others
want to be free, too?

316
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:08,340
Yes, but they're forced not to be.

317
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:11,177
lf there was nothing but the people,
everything would be better.

318
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:14,776
The king lost his throne
at the Tuileries, but he won Europe.

319
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:17,720
All the other kings feel like they've
been stung in the ass by the patriots,

320
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,121
and kings don't like
to be stung in the ass.

321
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:21,625
Especially if they're
sitting on the throne.

322
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:25,424
That's why the country is at risk
down in Marseille and on the Rhine.

323
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:27,863
We can't leave it like that.

324
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:31,164
Say, Catherine, are you mad at me?

325
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:33,204
Of course not.

326
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:37,469
But do you think we could go to Creil
on Sunday, in the stagecoach?

327
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:39,669
Yes, we'll go to Creil.

328
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:42,872
- Do you like going to Creil?
- Do l like going to Creil?

329
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:47,611
- The war will be over in two months.
- You think?

330
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:50,314
lt's inevitable. A unified nation
marches like a single man.

331
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:53,221
l so wish that today were Sunday.

332
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:55,589
Patience, my dear. Patience.

333
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:13,506
This is it, Lefebvre, we're leaving.

334
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:15,842
The battalion will be here
in two minutes.

335
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:18,075
l'll say goodbye to Heloiise.

336
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:21,550
When l think that we were supposed to go
to Creil together on Sunday...

337
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:26,416
You'll see, Catherine.

338
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:30,425
We'll also go to Creil another day.

339
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:34,488
Go on. Hurry and get it over with.

340
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:38,029
You're a real woman.

341
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:41,671
You're taking this well.

342
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,367
- You are too.
- Yes...

343
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,643
but this is my profession.

344
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:53,014
All right. The sooner
l leave, the better.

345
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:55,613
And the sooner l'll be back.

346
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:57,086
Hurry up then. lt hurts less.

347
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:04,518
All right then.

348
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:10,729
All right.

349
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:24,014
l really like you, you know?

350
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,743
Don't say it.

351
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,420
Go on.

352
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:44,227
Cheer up. l'll take care of Lefebvre,
you take care of Heloiise.

353
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:48,925
Hey, Catherine. l joined to piss off
my wife, and she thinks l'm angling!

354
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:56,840
Hi, Catherine.

355
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:06,615
Catherine, l came to say
my goodbyes.

356
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,279
You're also leaving for the Rhine?

357
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:12,289
The Rhine?
What would l do there?

358
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:16,191
l went to Saint-Cyr to fetch my sister.
Say hello, Elisa.

359
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:18,491
- l'm taking her to Corsica.
- To Corsica?

360
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:22,829
Yes, it's safer.
France is no place for young ladies.

361
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:24,562
You're off to Corsica, Lieutenant.

362
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:27,298
You don't give a damn
about the country, then?

363
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:30,466
What country?
Corsica is my country.

364
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,102
lt's not a country, it's an island.

365
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:35,806
An island for a man like you.

366
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,815
l wonder what you'll do on an island.

367
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:43,582
l'll try my luck. My future is there.
This is a blasted place for me.

368
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:48,490
Blasted? lf that isn't a disgrace...

369
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,858
Here's your shirt.
You owe me 26 launderings.

370
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:52,396
- 26 launderings?
- Yes.

371
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:55,433
- l only have two shirts.
- Yes, but l washed them 26 times.

372
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,435
Go on, don't worry.
Pay me another time.

373
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:02,530
You're right to return home with
your sister. You're not fit to command.

374
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:07,375
You're right.
Goodbye, Sans-Gene.

375
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:11,138
No hard feelings.

376
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:16,420
Poor man, l feel sorry for him.

377
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:27,588
4 YEARS LATER - ''THE POOR GUY'' WAS
CHlEF GENERAL OF THE lTALlAN ARMY.

378
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:29,633
What is this mess?

379
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:40,770
Forward!

380
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,814
Are you former soldiers of the regime
or soldiers of the Republic?

381
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,358
Do you think this is a parade?
Are you watching the procession?

382
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:56,689
Brigaud,
clear the bridge immediately.

383
00:29:56,761 --> 00:30:00,595
Artillery first. That's the priority.
lnfantry after.

384
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:03,691
But the horse and carriages
will cause a major delay.

385
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:06,965
To hell with them!
Have them ford the river.

386
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:07,472
Hey, you,

387
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,530
Hey, you,

388
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:10,904
the infantry and supply corps
have to ford the river down that way.

389
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,533
Everyone else, keep going.

390
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,874
Superior order. No arguing.

391
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:16,607
Let's go. Faster.

392
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,719
Carriages, that way. Ford the river.

393
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:32,485
Go on, clear the way. Hurry up.

394
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:46,570
That way. Follow the others.

395
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:50,603
Be careful. Go on.

396
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:53,875
Hey!

397
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,249
What is it now?

398
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,378
Hold on tight,
we're going into the water.

399
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:57,478
What for?

400
00:30:57,555 --> 00:30:59,284
General Bonaparte doesn't want us
to cross the bridge.

401
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:02,758
Bonaparte! We haven't heard
the last out of him.

402
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:07,364
Whose idea was it to go fight in ltaly?

403
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:10,868
ltaly hasn't done anything to us.
Why not Russia while we're at it?

404
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:13,130
You don't seem very fond of him.
What did he do to you?

405
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:16,640
lt's his fault that l'm here now,
chasing after my man.

406
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,939
ln four years of battle,
we've only seen each other once,

407
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:23,572
just long enough to marry.
No leaves. No news.

408
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,707
l thought
he was still in the Rhine army.

409
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:27,546
But no, he was transferred to ltaly.

410
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,985
l tried to get a permit. lt was no use!

411
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:32,420
You should have stayed at home.
lf you get captured here...

412
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:35,823
l have two words to say to Bonaparte.

413
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,454
Who does he have to thank
for being where he is now?

414
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:40,360
lf we hadn't been there on August 10,

415
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:43,662
he wouldn't be here today,
that poorly laundered urchin.

416
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:47,528
lt's rising, it's rising!

417
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:51,063
Make no mistake, Bonaparte
isn't waging war on the ltalians,

418
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:53,110
he's waging war on me!

419
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:57,781
l'm going to die.

420
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:03,647
Bonaparte. Hey, stop!

421
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:23,433
l could never do it.

422
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:25,669
lf you can do it with one,
you can do it with them all.

423
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:29,076
Last week it was the Austrians,
this week it's the French.

424
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:31,707
Look how happy they are to see us,

425
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,047
the true queens that we are.

426
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,211
There are men
who don't cheat on their wives.

427
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:39,450
Yeah, the dead ones!
Men are even worse than we are.

428
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:41,754
Put yourself in their shoes.
They're deprived.

429
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:43,760
You left a place like Paris
to chase after a man?

430
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:46,160
- Yes, of course.
- He must be something else.

431
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,562
- He's my husband!
- You call a husband a man?

432
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,624
- That depends.
- Look at them.

433
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:52,658
- Look at them.
- Hello.

434
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,802
They're crazy! l'm getting off.

435
00:32:57,875 --> 00:33:00,867
- You're being silly.
- l'm getting off.

436
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:02,037
Hello!

437
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:16,717
Wait. Wait a moment.

438
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:21,223
Let's go.

439
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:27,165
Come with me-- to the back.

440
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:29,968
Captain Lefebvre wants
to have a word with you.

441
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,675
Coming through!

442
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:42,742
Jerk!

443
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:09,102
- Wait here.
- Yes. l'll come see you

444
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,307
- after l'm done with the captain.
- Thank you.

445
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,649
Captain, she's here.

446
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:20,320
How is she?

447
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,293
You're excused.

448
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,467
See you soon.

449
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:48,181
- Go on, get out of here.
- Why?

450
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,083
He's my husband.

451
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:52,019
- Well, if he's your husband...
- Don't speak!

452
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,580
...that's another story.

453
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:17,679
Catherine, it's you.

454
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:20,046
Yes, it's me.

455
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,710
l swear l've never cheated on you.

456
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,482
And l swear l've never slapped you.

457
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:27,649
This is what l crossed the Alps for?
Bastard!

458
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,223
Catherine, open up!

459
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:33,593
Open up, Catherine! l'll explain!

460
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:35,097
Catherine! No!

461
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:44,568
l'll be right back.

462
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:49,935
Catherine.

463
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:55,415
- Catherine's here.
- l know, you idiot!

464
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,680
Catherine!

465
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,983
Catherine!

466
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:12,663
Catherine!

467
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:20,903
Catherine!

468
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:26,748
Catherine!

469
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,946
Catherine, listen to me!

470
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:36,688
Catherine!

471
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:47,366
Catherine, don't be silly!

472
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:01,584
Go away, l don't want
to see you anymore. Go!

473
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:03,552
Catherine!

474
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:06,613
Go away, l don't want
to see you anymore.

475
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:07,715
- Catherine.
- Don't touch me.

476
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:10,693
- Listen to me.
- Don't touch me!

477
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:12,456
Catherine.

478
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,896
This is silly.

479
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:16,228
Let me explain.

480
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,667
- No! No!
- Listen to me. Come!

481
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:49,527
Come on, don't you think
this is silly?

482
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,694
Be reasonable, Catherine.

483
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,601
You're right,
this is silly. lt's over.

484
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:57,436
Catherine, l didn't cheat on you.

485
00:37:57,508 --> 00:38:00,807
Perhaps l was going to, it's true.

486
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:02,812
Come on,
you're underestimating yourself.

487
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,142
You have to understand
that for a soldier...

488
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:05,705
Leave me alone.

489
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:09,014
- You're starting to annoy me.
- All right, it's okay.

490
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:38,339
Gently, all right?

491
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,003
So.

492
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:03,370
So, Augereau, where's that shelter?

493
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:06,433
We're almost there.
lt's that farm over there.

494
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:45,841
Congratulations.
Who the hell sent these men?

495
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:48,885
- You're a dishonor to the Republic.
- Leave them.

496
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:52,616
They've earned the right to have fun.
They are men, after all.

497
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,783
And they fight for that, too.

498
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:58,056
You can't have the girls
all to yourself.

499
00:39:58,129 --> 00:39:59,858
Who's in charge here?

500
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:05,399
l said, who's in charge here?

501
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:07,562
Captain Lefebvre,
Citizen General.

502
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:09,003
Go get him.

503
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:12,175
He's not here, Citizen General.

504
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:15,679
- What? He's not here?
- No, Citizen General.

505
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,543
Where is he?

506
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:19,810
He'll be back, Citizen General.

507
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:23,752
He left to go on patrol,
Citizen General.

508
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:27,279
- And who is he on patrol with?
- He's alone, Citizen General.

509
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:29,053
ls he with a girl?

510
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:32,095
No, Citizen General,
on the contrary.

511
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:35,360
What do you mean, on the contrary?
Go on, call the lieutenant.

512
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,424
He's not here, Citizen General.

513
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:40,732
Congratulations, Augereau,
you have a swell assistant.

514
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:43,797
This nitwit over here.
Where did your lieutenant go?

515
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:47,173
He must have left to find
Captain Lefebvre, Citizen General.

516
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:48,973
Thus leaving the battalion in anarchy?

517
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:51,947
What a mess! No one in charge!

518
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:54,280
Pardon me, Citizen General,

519
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:56,649
l'm the one in charge here--
Sergeant Fricasse.

520
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,521
lt gets better!
Sergeants now serve as captains.

521
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:05,392
Soon privates
will replace generals, right?

522
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:08,261
Negligence of service.
Abandonment of post.

523
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:12,166
You will shoot the captain at dawn,
along with the lieutenant, of course.

524
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:17,436
Perfect. Since you refuse
to answer my questions,

525
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:20,068
both of you will be shot.

526
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:37,493
My poor little Catherine,

527
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:40,758
to think that you came all this way
only to die with me.

528
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:43,391
At least we'll stay together this way.

529
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:45,526
All the same,

530
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:48,037
l find it strange
to die here, in a mill.

531
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:50,573
- Why?
- lt's where l started.

532
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:52,370
My father was a miller.

533
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:56,038
- l remember when l was six years old...
- No memories! Now's not the time.

534
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:58,604
Think about the future instead,

535
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:03,210
the future we no longer have.
Damn it, we have to get out.

536
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:06,256
- l don't want to die!
- Be brave, Catherine.

537
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:09,520
l am brave because l want to live.
That's all l know how to do.

538
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:11,288
l don't know how to die.
l never learned.

539
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,296
l haven't reached that age.

540
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,924
Listen-- artillery.

541
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,092
Do you think it's for us?

542
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:19,192
Do you think
they'd kill us with a cannon?

543
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:22,933
Cannon or not,
we'll be dead tonight anyway.

544
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:24,497
Not necessarily.

545
00:42:26,176 --> 00:42:28,667
- Where are you going?
- Wait.

546
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:31,374
- Answer me, Lefebvre.
- You'll see.

547
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:33,416
- Well?
- Wait.

548
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:35,918
- Why are you doing that?
- Leave me be.

549
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:37,783
- Well?
- You're getting on my nerves!

550
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:40,949
- Getting on your nerves!
- Hey, next to you, there's a lever.

551
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:44,222
All you have to do is try
and lift it with your shoulder.

552
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:47,594
- All l have to do is...
- That's right. lt's all you have to do.

553
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:50,031
- Hurry up.
- l'll still try it.

554
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,091
- Hurry up.
- Shut up, would you?

555
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:53,898
- Well?
- Shut up.

556
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:56,701
- Make an effort.
- Please don't get on my nerves.

557
00:42:56,774 --> 00:43:00,471
Keep going a little more.

558
00:43:00,544 --> 00:43:01,738
That's it.

559
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:05,608
lt's going to work.

560
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:09,879
You have it?
Yes.

561
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:20,494
- ls that okay?
- Yes, it is.

562
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:33,439
Lower the lever. Lower the lever.

563
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:44,679
Careful, Lefebvre.

564
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,051
You're tickling me.

565
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:53,119
Now's not the time.
Follow me. Hurry up.

566
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:12,272
- The cows!
- Why?

567
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:21,555
Come on, let's go.

568
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:24,685
lt's a surprise attack.
They'll massacre them.

569
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:27,728
- We have to warn them.
- How?

570
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:30,995
- Do you trust me?
- Yes, as long as we don't get shot.

571
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:32,729
Come on.

572
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:35,033
Wow, that's high.
Hold on to me, don't let me fall.

573
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:36,595
- There's no danger.
- Yes.

574
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:39,802
When l was a kid, the first time
l climbed the blades of the mill,

575
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:41,344
my dad kicked me in the ass.

576
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:43,380
l told you it was
a bad time to get soft.

577
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:45,677
Here, grab on.

578
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:31,189
Lefebvre!

579
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:38,697
Grab one, we'll put them
back in the mill.

580
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:47,402
My, he's heavy. Won't he wake up?

581
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:38,392
Wait. Watch out, hide!

582
00:47:40,924 --> 00:47:43,324
Let me take care of this. Stay here.

583
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,967
- Here.
- Quick quick.

584
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:15,785
Come on.

585
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:38,106
What's going on? lt's coming
from over there. Let's go. Forward!

586
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:48,851
What does that mean? The Austrians?

587
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:51,258
l don't understand.
They were 20 leagues away.

588
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:53,228
That may be, but they're there now.

589
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:55,060
They're crazy.
What are they blowing up?

590
00:48:55,132 --> 00:48:59,364
We'll teach them to make noise
without my command. Let's go!

591
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:10,538
Soldiers! There's a mill up there
full of Austrians.

592
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:13,105
Go pay them a visit.

593
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:15,117
Forward. Go!

594
00:51:18,275 --> 00:51:21,403
l can't go any further.
l think l twisted my foot.

595
00:51:21,478 --> 00:51:25,380
Lay down. Let me take a look.

596
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:28,816
- lt hurts.
- Hear that? lt's the French.

597
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:34,651
Hey!

598
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:37,489
Wait for me.
Guard our prisoners.

599
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:39,961
- Watch out for the Austrians.
- They're far away.

600
00:51:42,566 --> 00:51:45,501
Hey! Hey!

601
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,974
- What are you doing here?
- lt's me.

602
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:54,010
- lt's me, what?
- lt's me, Citizen General.

603
00:51:54,077 --> 00:51:55,942
- lt's me.
- lt's me, who?

604
00:51:56,012 --> 00:51:59,675
lt's me, the one who blew that up
right under your noses to alert you.

605
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:01,876
l'm in the 13th Battalion,
Augereau Division.

606
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,886
l took the captain
and the colonel prisoner.

607
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,252
- They're over there, as stiff as logs.
- Where are the others?

608
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:09,520
Over there. lf you want to catch them,
you'll have to hurry up.

609
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:12,994
- You're brave. What's your name?
- Captain Lefebvre.

610
00:52:13,063 --> 00:52:16,260
Lefebvre? Well, Captain Lefebvre,
that was a close call.

611
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:17,994
l know a thing or two about that.

612
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:21,367
- You were almost shot too.
- You're telling me!

613
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:25,670
Rest assured that's all over now.
l'm promoting you to colonel.

614
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:27,801
Deal with the prisoners. Forward!

615
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:33,179
Colonel?

616
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:36,852
Thank you, Citizen General, thank you!

617
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:40,515
Catherine, l'm a colonel! A colonel!

618
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:42,888
Colonel?

619
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:45,223
- ls that a joke?
- Bonaparte himself promoted me.

620
00:52:45,295 --> 00:52:47,559
- Bonaparte?
- Yes, Bonaparte.

621
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:48,859
How's your ankle?

622
00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:51,526
Better, but walking's a different story.

623
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:53,694
l'll issue an order
to have you evacuated to Paris,

624
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:56,034
now that l have new responsibilities.

625
00:52:56,106 --> 00:52:58,631
No, l'm not leaving you again.

626
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:01,199
Don't think you're going to war alone.

627
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:03,337
War is very serious, Catherine.

628
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:04,937
lf it were that serious,

629
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,882
Bonaparte wouldn't
have made you colonel.

630
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,353
BONAPARTE
SAVlOR OF THE NATlON

631
00:53:14,758 --> 00:53:17,226
BONAPARTE
FlRST CONSUL

632
00:53:19,162 --> 00:53:21,528
BONAPARTE

633
00:53:23,466 --> 00:53:25,934
BONAPARTE
FlRST EMPEROR

634
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:29,404
NAPOLEON
MASTER OF ALL EUROPE

635
00:53:40,116 --> 00:53:43,882
You're our monarch, Sire,
but you're also our brother.

636
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:46,616
Don't ask us to forget the affection

637
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:49,659
that we, your brothers
and sisters, feel for you.

638
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:53,593
Will that affection
no longer be mutual?

639
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:56,188
Have you heard us?

640
00:53:56,266 --> 00:53:59,258
The man you want to make king
is a stranger to the family.

641
00:53:59,336 --> 00:54:03,466
Give Westphalia to the Duke of Danzig?
Your Majesty is crazy.

642
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:04,905
Think about it, brother,

643
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:08,308
the Duke of Danzig doesn't have
what it takes to be king.

644
00:54:08,378 --> 00:54:10,312
lt's enough to make me
die of laughter.

645
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,211
Die of shame, yes.

646
00:54:12,282 --> 00:54:15,615
Westphalia is something.
Two million inhabitants.

647
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:17,346
lt's a nice return.

648
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:20,583
Europe must absolutely not
leave the family.

649
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:24,525
Don't you see, Jerome? The kingdom
is slipping right through our fingers.

650
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,221
Say something!

651
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:30,596
There are times when l want
to become English.

652
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:32,692
Yes, English.

653
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:34,600
Everyone in the family is served

654
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:38,198
except me, the cursed one.

655
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:41,506
Your Majesty forced me to divorce.
l obeyed.

656
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:44,479
l thought l'd receive
some compensation.

657
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:48,881
l don't know, Spain or ltaly--

658
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:52,319
something.
My wife was worth a throne.

659
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:54,653
What did l gain from all of that?

660
00:54:54,724 --> 00:54:57,784
The title of rear admiral.

661
00:54:57,861 --> 00:55:01,160
A floating kingdom.
And during that time,

662
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:05,565
Holland was given to that idiot Louis.
Joseph got Spain. Elisa, Tuscany.

663
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:08,729
Caroline got Naples.
And I was dispossessed.

664
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:12,366
I don't always agree with him, but...

665
00:55:12,442 --> 00:55:16,139
So that's the size of Westphalia.
It's the size of a handkerchief.

666
00:55:16,212 --> 00:55:18,510
Is that what all this fuss is about?

667
00:55:18,581 --> 00:55:22,984
Give it to the Duke of Danzig
and let's not talk about it anymore.

668
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:25,715
- Of course, you...
- I what?

669
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:28,690
- What are you trying to insinuate?
- You don't give a damn.

670
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:31,989
Your kingdom is your bed,
and it has over two million inhabitants.

671
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:33,791
Yes, not counting the tourists.

672
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:37,799
Mrs. Murat, l was never
Junot's mistress.

673
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:40,427
You have some nerve!

674
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:42,664
Stop stop, fools!

675
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:45,674
- You are dishonoring the family.
- Look who's talking, imbecile.

676
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:47,801
- Be careful--
- Stop stop!

677
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:53,548
I don't think anyone has worse luck
than l when it comes to family.

678
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:57,346
All right, let's recapitulate:

679
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:00,480
Lucien is an ingrate;
Joseph, a libertine;

680
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:03,788
Louis is a cripple;

681
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,885
And Jerome is a mischief.

682
00:56:05,962 --> 00:56:09,693
- But, Sire...
- And he's vain, mischievous, lazy,

683
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:11,461
inept and deceitful.

684
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:15,699
As for you, ladies,
we know what you are--

685
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:19,469
the family heritage,
that which is owed to me.

686
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:22,978
l was dispossessed.
But what did you possess

687
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:26,072
that you could be dispossessed of?.

688
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:28,879
Europe should not leave the family.

689
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:32,820
You talk about it as though
you conquered the land yourself.

690
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:35,414
Not leave the family. Really?

691
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:38,017
And where do you come from?

692
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:43,361
And where would you be
if l hadn't elevated you to my level?

693
00:56:43,433 --> 00:56:47,301
So low that you'd still be in Corsica,

694
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:49,702
starving to death.

695
00:56:49,773 --> 00:56:52,503
l had to go to ltaly in search of food.

696
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:56,170
Useless mouths, full bellies.

697
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:58,180
And today you fight over a throne

698
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:00,842
like dogs fighting
over a bone in the mud.

699
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:03,647
This is for me! That's for me!

700
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,654
Give me Rome,
and l'll give you Byzantium.

701
00:57:05,722 --> 00:57:07,917
Give me Byzantium,
and l'll give you Athens.

702
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:11,757
Take it then!

703
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:14,854
You want a piece of Europe?
Who wants a piece of Europe?

704
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:18,196
There won't be enough for everybody.
This is for you.

705
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:21,704
This is for you. This is for you.

706
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:23,602
Who wants a piece of England?

707
00:57:23,673 --> 00:57:26,164
A piece of ltaly? A piece of Austria?

708
00:57:26,242 --> 00:57:29,541
Who wants a piece of Prussia? Take it!

709
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:32,274
Take Europe and bring it home with you!

710
00:57:32,348 --> 00:57:35,044
Take it! l don't want to see you again!

711
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:43,181
Any more of that
and l'd have gotten angry.

712
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:46,160
- Fouche!
- Sire.

713
00:57:48,698 --> 00:57:52,691
- Go see the Duke of Danzig tomorrow.
- The Duke of Danzig. Yes, Sire.

714
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:53,861
You will tell him...

715
00:57:53,937 --> 00:57:56,098
Yes, Sire.
l believe it's the best solution.

716
00:57:57,574 --> 00:57:59,371
l heard everything.

717
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:25,895
Your Excellency.

718
00:58:25,969 --> 00:58:28,062
- Are the duke and duchess inside?
- Yes, Your Excellency.

719
00:58:28,137 --> 00:58:29,399
Perfect.

720
00:58:41,784 --> 00:58:44,651
And in the duchess's mail?

721
00:58:44,721 --> 00:58:47,554
Nothing, Your Excellency.

722
00:58:47,624 --> 00:58:50,354
Nothing that's worth
the price l pay you.

723
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:58,032
- And the duke, still no liaison?
- No, Your Excellency.

724
00:58:58,101 --> 00:58:59,966
l question what you're doing here.

725
00:59:05,775 --> 00:59:08,437
- Nothing, really.
- Nothing, Your Excellency.

726
00:59:08,511 --> 00:59:11,105
l'll find you another position then.

727
00:59:17,487 --> 00:59:20,081
- Whom shall l announce, Excellency?
- Me.

728
00:59:20,156 --> 00:59:23,148
You'll introduce Mr. Esterel later on.

729
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:25,217
My God, it's so ugly.

730
00:59:27,263 --> 00:59:30,198
- My dear Count?
- No, thank you. Never in the morning.

731
00:59:41,644 --> 00:59:44,010
Would Your Excellency please follow me?

732
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,207
The duke and duchess are awaiting you.

733
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:52,179
- Come in, Fouche.
- Come in, dear Duke.

734
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:53,847
- Hello, dear Duke.
- Hello, dear Duke.

735
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:55,914
My respects, ma'am.

736
00:59:55,992 --> 00:59:59,450
You'll have to excuse me.
l always iron Lefebvre's shirts.

737
00:59:59,529 --> 01:00:03,431
- Yes, my dear Duke.
- We've forgotten how to be informal.

738
01:00:03,499 --> 01:00:05,626
Everything is getting lost,
don't you think, Zi-Zig?

739
01:00:05,702 --> 01:00:07,135
Zi-Zig. That's me.

740
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:09,763
lt's nicer than ''Duke of Danzig,'' right?

741
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:13,400
Between us,
does your wife call you Fou-Fou?

742
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:16,468
Our relationship is a little different.

743
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:20,141
l only call him the Duke of Danzig
when we're in bed.

744
01:00:21,551 --> 01:00:25,954
We joke around in bed,
my dear little Duke of Danzig.

745
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:29,924
But otherwise, it's stupid
to call old friends by their titles.

746
01:00:29,993 --> 01:00:34,225
Like with the emperor. The idea
of calling him Your Majesty-- no no.

747
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:37,562
l still picture him
wearing his mended shirt.

748
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:42,466
To think that we haven't seen each other
since the last time. lt's incredible.

749
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:47,305
l'd be surprised if he still
remembered me, with the life he leads.

750
01:00:47,377 --> 01:00:50,437
Well, you'll have the chance
to see him again.

751
01:00:50,513 --> 01:00:54,916
He asked me to invite you to a reception
at the court. lt's in three days.

752
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:59,614
The court? Me? Hey, Zi-Zig,
can you picture us at the court?

753
01:00:59,689 --> 01:01:02,590
No, thank him on our behalf.

754
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:05,822
Tell him l'm very sorry,
but l'm used to going to bed early.

755
01:01:05,895 --> 01:01:10,332
- lt's an order, dear friend.
- An order for me?

756
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:14,995
- Come on, Catherine.
- He can invite me over for coffee then.

757
01:01:15,071 --> 01:01:16,561
You don't have coffee
with the emperor.

758
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:18,630
Too bad, then!

759
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:21,575
Maybe she does have good reason
not to go to the Tuileries.

760
01:01:21,644 --> 01:01:23,805
- Really?
- lt's safer.

761
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:26,407
Safer?

762
01:01:26,482 --> 01:01:30,179
Why expose yourself
to people who are eyeing you?

763
01:01:30,253 --> 01:01:32,050
- What people?
- People.

764
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:36,490
People who would like
to trip you and see you fall.

765
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,151
The emperor's sisters,
for example.

766
01:01:38,227 --> 01:01:42,027
- Are you saying everyone is eyeing me?
- Yes.

767
01:01:42,098 --> 01:01:45,499
Well, in that case,
l'll go to the Tuileries

768
01:01:45,568 --> 01:01:48,366
and we'll see who eats whom.

769
01:01:48,438 --> 01:01:49,996
lf they needle me, it'll get noisy.

770
01:01:50,073 --> 01:01:52,735
Refrain from responding to them,
that's all they want.

771
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:55,277
lf, by chance, you find yourself
on the verge of exploding,

772
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:56,936
keep your eyes on me--

773
01:01:57,013 --> 01:02:00,540
the snuffbox,
the snort, the warning.

774
01:02:00,616 --> 01:02:02,447
Good plan, Fouche.

775
01:02:02,518 --> 01:02:05,885
ln the days to come,
will you remember

776
01:02:05,955 --> 01:02:08,446
that l was on your side in this matter?

777
01:02:08,524 --> 01:02:12,290
That's all very nice,
but what will l wear?

778
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:14,955
Very simple.
Court dress and jacket.

779
01:02:15,031 --> 01:02:17,022
l went to see Mrs. Despeaux.
She'll take care of everything.

780
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:19,898
A court dress? With the train?

781
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:21,630
Yes.

782
01:02:21,704 --> 01:02:25,299
- ls it useful?
- lt's essential for curtseying.

783
01:02:25,374 --> 01:02:28,400
- l don't know how to curtsey.
- You'll learn.

784
01:02:28,478 --> 01:02:31,641
Follow me and l'll have
someone special teach you how.

785
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:33,705
Come, Zi-Zig, we'll curtsey.

786
01:02:35,651 --> 01:02:38,643
- Let me introduce you to Mr. Esterel.
- Come, Zi-Zig.

787
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:41,849
He was once employed
by Queen Marie Antoinette.

788
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:45,189
He is currently
a professor of etiquette.

789
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:49,061
- You know the Duke and Duchess?
- Yes, l know Mrs. Lefebvre.

790
01:02:49,132 --> 01:02:51,100
Pardon me, the Duchess.

791
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:53,567
You know, as for curtseys...

792
01:02:53,636 --> 01:02:56,503
lt's a habit to pick up. lt all depends
on who you're bowing down to.

793
01:02:56,572 --> 01:02:59,302
Of course,
you can't always choose.

794
01:02:59,375 --> 01:03:01,400
What are you doing? Are you moving?

795
01:03:01,477 --> 01:03:05,436
This will serve
as a train for the moment.

796
01:03:05,515 --> 01:03:07,915
l'll get tangled up in it.

797
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:10,748
No, you'll see. There.

798
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:12,981
- All yours, my dear Count.
- Very well.

799
01:03:13,055 --> 01:03:14,352
The Duchess would like to...

800
01:03:14,423 --> 01:03:16,254
Call me Mrs. Lefebvre, as you just were.

801
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:19,453
We'll all feel more at ease.
l don't like fancy names either.

802
01:03:19,529 --> 01:03:21,861
Very well. Watch me.

803
01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:24,195
One, two, three.

804
01:03:25,601 --> 01:03:27,501
A little bend in the knee will suffice.

805
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:29,538
One, two, three.

806
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,203
Easier said than done.

807
01:03:33,276 --> 01:03:35,437
Your hand, Mrs. Lefebvre.

808
01:03:35,511 --> 01:03:38,639
Make the same gestures as me.

809
01:03:38,714 --> 01:03:40,682
One, two, three.

810
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:46,349
- Be quiet, Lefebvre.
- Again, please.

811
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:48,720
One, two, three.

812
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:51,959
Not bad.

813
01:03:52,028 --> 01:03:54,826
- Please, no emotion.
- Yes, no emotion.

814
01:03:54,897 --> 01:03:56,592
- Let's start over.
- Start over.

815
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:58,657
One, two, three.

816
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:03,570
- Thank you.
- Again.

817
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:05,766
One, two, three.

818
01:04:06,943 --> 01:04:09,878
l did it, Zi-Zig, l did it!

819
01:04:09,946 --> 01:04:11,914
Again, please.

820
01:04:11,981 --> 01:04:13,915
- And less stiff this time.
- Yes.

821
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:16,611
One, two, three.

822
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,518
Did you see that, Zi-Zig?

823
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:21,056
lt's fantastic!

824
01:04:21,123 --> 01:04:23,785
l told you that you were made
for life in the court.

825
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,522
For Napoleon's court, yes.

826
01:04:27,563 --> 01:04:30,828
Skip the commentary, Mr. Esterel.
Now the curtsey.

827
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,664
All right, we'll try.

828
01:04:33,736 --> 01:04:36,261
l like Mr. Esterel
because he's good-humored.

829
01:04:36,339 --> 01:04:39,934
Look at me, please.
l bow down like this,

830
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:43,137
all the while gracefully supporting
my hindquarters with my left leg.

831
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:45,772
And then l swoop down softly.

832
01:04:45,848 --> 01:04:48,282
- All yours, madame.
- Yes, l understand.

833
01:04:49,352 --> 01:04:51,752
- The right leg behind you.
- One moment.

834
01:04:53,189 --> 01:04:55,885
- The right leg behind you. Bow.
- Yes.

835
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,055
And now swoop down.

836
01:05:00,863 --> 01:05:03,491
A little more softly, if you please.

837
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:05,227
Swoop down.

838
01:05:05,301 --> 01:05:09,237
- Swoop down.
- Swoop down? l'll end up on my ass!

839
01:05:09,305 --> 01:05:13,036
No no. You're the epitome of grace.

840
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:15,202
Again.

841
01:05:16,379 --> 01:05:19,678
There. Yes, perfect.

842
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:21,216
- lt's perfect?
- Yes.

843
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:25,186
- How's that?
- l believe that you are now prepared

844
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:27,814
to go to the court, Duchess.

845
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:29,653
Thank you
for your encouraging words.

846
01:05:29,725 --> 01:05:31,522
l'll try to do you honor.

847
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:33,892
l promise you a triumph.

848
01:05:33,963 --> 01:05:37,296
lt's a pity you never
keep your promises, dear Duke.

849
01:05:37,366 --> 01:05:38,890
One, two, three!

850
01:05:52,415 --> 01:05:56,215
The Duke and Duchess of Danzig.

851
01:06:11,934 --> 01:06:15,301
- l'll be lucky if l get to the bottom.
- Don't be scared, l'm here.

852
01:06:45,468 --> 01:06:47,993
- Are you scared?
- No, l'm nervous.

853
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:50,630
- Where's the empress?
- l don't see her.

854
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:53,574
- Shit!
- Come on, Catherine.

855
01:06:53,642 --> 01:06:54,700
Stay calm.

856
01:06:58,347 --> 01:07:00,406
Duke, His Majesty awaits you
in his chambers.

857
01:07:00,483 --> 01:07:02,713
- But first l have to--
- lf the Duke would please follow me.

858
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:04,616
Please excuse me.
The emperor...

859
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:06,917
l'll be right back.

860
01:07:06,989 --> 01:07:10,186
- Don't leave me! Lefebvre!
- Be strong!

861
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:14,389
- lt's not that bad.
- Hello, madame.

862
01:07:14,463 --> 01:07:17,227
lt's you! Where's the empress?

863
01:07:17,299 --> 01:07:19,961
- She's ill. She won't be coming.
- Great! No curtsey.

864
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:21,128
Yes, to the emperor.

865
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:23,694
What? l won't curtsey
to a former customer.

866
01:07:23,773 --> 01:07:26,970
That's exactly the sort of thing
you shouldn't say here.

867
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:29,477
Come with me, l'll introduce you
to the more composed ladies.

868
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:33,571
- The train.
- You haven't forgotten that if l snort,

869
01:07:33,649 --> 01:07:35,514
it means you're heading down
a dangerous path.

870
01:07:35,584 --> 01:07:37,108
- A warning.
- Yes yes.

871
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:39,086
Mrs. Lauriston.

872
01:07:39,155 --> 01:07:42,886
Mrs. de Turenne, Mrs. de Thomiere.

873
01:07:42,958 --> 01:07:45,449
Of course, you know
the Duchess of Danzig.

874
01:07:45,528 --> 01:07:48,361
- By reputation.
- By reputation?

875
01:07:48,431 --> 01:07:51,264
The Duke of Castiglione
talks of you often.

876
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:53,426
The Duke of Castiglione?

877
01:07:53,502 --> 01:07:55,163
Pierrot!

878
01:07:55,237 --> 01:07:58,604
Yes, Augereau.
The Duke of Castiglione, Pierrot.

879
01:07:58,674 --> 01:08:02,166
He's a good friend.
He comes over for soup often.

880
01:08:03,946 --> 01:08:07,541
Beef soup, of course.
And what has he said about me?

881
01:08:07,616 --> 01:08:10,551
Very kind things.
He holds you in high esteem.

882
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:13,747
He hides his game well. He has his way
of expressing his esteem for me.

883
01:08:13,823 --> 01:08:17,122
You wouldn't believe what he does
to make Zi-Zig mad.

884
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:20,292
No, l can't tell you what he does.

885
01:08:20,362 --> 01:08:23,593
ls Mr. Fouche hindering you? Fouche,
distance yourself for a moment.

886
01:08:23,666 --> 01:08:25,566
- Would you like me to...
- Yes.

887
01:08:25,634 --> 01:08:28,159
No, please. l can say it
in front of him.

888
01:08:28,237 --> 01:08:31,638
He knows Augereau as well as l do,
and that as soon as he sees a woman,

889
01:08:31,707 --> 01:08:34,437
he can't stop himself
from pinching her...

890
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,271
You may sit down now.

891
01:08:40,349 --> 01:08:43,876
What was l saying? Augereau
just came and pinched my behind.

892
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:47,047
You're lucky that Zi-Zig
is talking with the emperor.

893
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:50,320
Lefebvre, l've decided
you would do me a great service

894
01:08:50,392 --> 01:08:53,623
by accepting
the crown of Westphalia.

895
01:08:53,696 --> 01:08:56,460
- The crown?
- Yes, Lefebvre.

896
01:08:56,532 --> 01:08:59,933
- And the throne?
- The crown and the throne, yes.

897
01:09:00,002 --> 01:09:02,664
l don't understand.

898
01:09:02,738 --> 01:09:04,603
- Does that mean l would be king?
- Yes.

899
01:09:04,673 --> 01:09:06,163
- And my wife would be queen?
- Of course.

900
01:09:06,242 --> 01:09:09,211
Sire, it's too much.

901
01:09:09,278 --> 01:09:12,736
Pull yourself together.
You handled it better in Danzig.

902
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:14,908
l'd already seen battle in Danzig.

903
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:16,918
And this is the first time
l've been named king.

904
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:19,181
You've taken me by surprise.

905
01:09:19,255 --> 01:09:21,155
- Are you pleased?
- So pleased that l don't feel anything.

906
01:09:21,223 --> 01:09:24,954
You'll quickly get used to the idea.
lt's a habit to pick up.

907
01:09:25,027 --> 01:09:29,327
We drove away the kings and now
we need someone to take their place.

908
01:09:29,398 --> 01:09:30,956
The Republic has its advantages,
doesn't it?

909
01:09:31,033 --> 01:09:33,024
We wouldn't be here without it.

910
01:09:33,102 --> 01:09:34,967
You're telling me.

911
01:09:35,037 --> 01:09:39,531
As of now, you are officially the King
of Westphalia. You may be seated.

912
01:09:39,608 --> 01:09:41,041
Thank you, Sire.

913
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:42,975
Here, your kingdom.

914
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,648
My wife will be pleased to find out.

915
01:09:47,983 --> 01:09:50,383
And that's how l met Lefebvre.

916
01:09:50,452 --> 01:09:53,182
lt's a pleasure to listen to you.

917
01:09:54,256 --> 01:09:56,224
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

918
01:10:00,095 --> 01:10:04,031
Since the Duchess of Danzig
doesn't want to come and greet us...

919
01:10:04,099 --> 01:10:06,124
Leave her exactly where she is.

920
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:08,727
l intend for her to stay
where she is, in her place.

921
01:10:08,804 --> 01:10:10,601
Come, Jerome.

922
01:10:10,673 --> 01:10:14,165
There's nothing more amusing than
dethroning a queen before she's crowned.

923
01:10:16,946 --> 01:10:19,676
Curtsey, dear friend. Curtsey.
Pardon me.

924
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:23,913
lf Their lmperial Highnesses
would deign to allow me to introduce

925
01:10:23,986 --> 01:10:26,386
the Duchess of Danzig...

926
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:31,785
Her lmperial Highness, the Queen
of Naples, Grand Duchess of Bergues.

927
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:33,225
Your Highness.

928
01:10:33,295 --> 01:10:37,197
Her lmperial Highness,
the Princess of Lucca and Piombino.

929
01:10:37,266 --> 01:10:38,324
Your Highness.

930
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:42,530
Her lmperial Highness, the Princess
of Borghese, Grand Duchess of Guastalla.

931
01:10:42,605 --> 01:10:45,039
Your--
damn, l muddled that one.

932
01:10:45,107 --> 01:10:46,972
l did what l could.
What do you want me to do?

933
01:10:47,042 --> 01:10:49,135
lt's like mayonnaise,
sometimes it takes...

934
01:10:49,211 --> 01:10:52,476
His lmperial Highness,
Prince Jerome Bonaparte.

935
01:10:52,548 --> 01:10:54,914
Again? This time l'll get it right.

936
01:10:58,187 --> 01:11:02,317
That shut you up, eh?
You can be proud of your student.

937
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:03,858
He's the one who made me rehearse.

938
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:06,656
You hid this one from us, Fouche.
Congratulations.

939
01:11:06,729 --> 01:11:10,221
You have a student that will certainly
make great progress.

940
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:12,324
You do have a lot to learn indeed.

941
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:15,632
l don't agree with that at all.
But with him, if l stumble,

942
01:11:15,704 --> 01:11:18,138
l know l'll always fall on my hind legs.

943
01:11:18,207 --> 01:11:22,007
Your hind legs, really? l neglected
to notice that we had hind legs.

944
01:11:22,077 --> 01:11:24,068
lf l understood correctly,

945
01:11:24,146 --> 01:11:26,080
your hind legs have never
taken you to the Tuileries.

946
01:11:26,148 --> 01:11:28,810
My goodness, no.
l've hesitated to come here.

947
01:11:28,884 --> 01:11:29,976
l'm a little shy.

948
01:11:30,052 --> 01:11:32,612
- No.
- Shy?

949
01:11:32,688 --> 01:11:34,815
How do you get along
with your customers, then?

950
01:11:36,225 --> 01:11:39,820
- My customers?
- Yes, we heard that you were--

951
01:11:39,895 --> 01:11:41,328
A laundress, yes.

952
01:11:41,397 --> 01:11:43,490
You washed
other people's dirty laundry.

953
01:11:43,565 --> 01:11:47,160
- l was a laundress, after all.
- And it didn't make you nauseous?

954
01:11:47,236 --> 01:11:51,332
Why? lt's better to smell
like soap than other things.

955
01:11:51,407 --> 01:11:54,638
- No profession is without merit.
- There are only dirty jobs.

956
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:58,908
Washing a couple of your
brother's shirts was not a dirty job.

957
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:01,848
That's when l met your brother,

958
01:12:01,917 --> 01:12:03,646
and you at the same time.

959
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:06,153
l don't recall.

960
01:12:06,221 --> 01:12:10,988
l do. lt was in August of '92.

961
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:15,087
The funny thing is, if l hadn't been
a laundress, l wouldn't be here tonight.

962
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:19,225
All of us are ladies of August 10,
all in the same boat.

963
01:12:19,301 --> 01:12:24,000
For, Your Highness, where would
you and l be without August 10?

964
01:12:25,074 --> 01:12:28,407
We all come from far away,
and we have nothing to hide.

965
01:12:28,477 --> 01:12:30,138
Look at Augereau.

966
01:12:30,212 --> 01:12:33,511
His mother sold vegetables
in the rue de Mouffetard.

967
01:12:33,582 --> 01:12:36,449
Hey, Augereau! You can stay.

968
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:40,215
Don't be ashamed.
On the contrary, it honors us.

969
01:12:40,289 --> 01:12:42,951
Like you, Jourdan,
you were a shop boy.

970
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:46,859
And you, Massena, you started out
by selling olives in the street.

971
01:12:46,929 --> 01:12:49,159
No, not olives-- oranges.

972
01:12:49,231 --> 01:12:53,531
Pardon me, Duke of Rivoli,
that changes everything.

973
01:12:53,602 --> 01:12:56,935
And l forgot your husband,
Murat the brave.

974
01:12:57,005 --> 01:13:00,668
What was the King of Naples?
A manservant for his innkeeper father.

975
01:13:00,743 --> 01:13:05,009
And he must be very proud today when
he hears people say ''Your Highness.''

976
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:10,040
The same people who once said, perhaps,
''Hey, kid, change my plate.''

977
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:12,212
We're an odd sort of nobility.

978
01:13:12,287 --> 01:13:15,188
We descend not from crusaders,
but from ourselves.

979
01:13:15,257 --> 01:13:20,024
Yet another reason to keep that language
and those manners out of the court.

980
01:13:20,095 --> 01:13:23,360
- Mrs. Sans-Gene was a sutler.
- She thinks she's still at the camp.

981
01:13:23,432 --> 01:13:25,024
When she slept with the privates.

982
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:28,831
- One day here, one day there.
- This one today, that one tomorrow.

983
01:13:30,339 --> 01:13:31,533
- What?
- Please, madame.

984
01:13:31,607 --> 01:13:32,904
Leave me alone!

985
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:37,110
So that's what you've been driving at.

986
01:13:37,179 --> 01:13:41,411
Your Highness, ''sleeping'' has a
different meaning for you than for me.

987
01:13:41,483 --> 01:13:44,509
You should be the last ones
to reproach me for the life l've led.

988
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:46,417
lf it pleases Your Highnesses or not,

989
01:13:46,488 --> 01:13:49,753
the men l slept with had more respect
for the woman l am

990
01:13:49,825 --> 01:13:53,886
and the name l carry than for you,
the highnesses that you are!

991
01:13:53,962 --> 01:13:55,452
l had my share of fun.

992
01:13:55,531 --> 01:13:58,398
l had my share of fun across Europe.

993
01:13:58,467 --> 01:14:01,698
And they knew they'd find me
when they needed me--

994
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:05,672
to dress their wounds,
to bring them something to drink.

995
01:14:05,741 --> 01:14:07,641
The troops l slept with,

996
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:11,575
some of them even
fell asleep in my arms.

997
01:14:12,681 --> 01:14:16,412
And to whom did l give his final kiss?
Sleep well, my sweet.

998
01:14:18,554 --> 01:14:22,251
And now they all sleep alone,
like that poor Fricasse.

999
01:14:24,026 --> 01:14:25,459
Poor Fricasse.

1000
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:29,624
My love stories are nice,
aren't they?

1001
01:14:29,698 --> 01:14:32,360
You could laugh,
if you had the courage.

1002
01:14:32,434 --> 01:14:35,460
Just by pouring a drink
for the soldiers who won you a kingdom,

1003
01:14:35,537 --> 01:14:38,529
l did more for your crown than you did.
You wouldn't even stoop down

1004
01:14:38,607 --> 01:14:40,802
to pick up the crown
that was soaked in their blood.

1005
01:14:40,876 --> 01:14:43,003
You'll regret saying that.

1006
01:14:49,551 --> 01:14:50,882
Did you see?

1007
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:52,944
What?

1008
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:04,488
Zi-Zig, Zi-Zig!
What's going on?

1009
01:15:04,566 --> 01:15:07,467
Nothing. Actually,
something incredible.

1010
01:15:07,536 --> 01:15:10,596
- l keep wondering if l'm dreaming.
- Yes.

1011
01:15:10,672 --> 01:15:13,402
- No, not here. Come.
- The train! Wait!

1012
01:15:13,475 --> 01:15:17,275
l hope you're not stupid enough
to play into the duchess's hands.

1013
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:19,712
Explain your behavior then.

1014
01:15:19,781 --> 01:15:23,945
- Trust me.
- As if you could be trusted.

1015
01:15:24,019 --> 01:15:26,044
l trust myself,
and l know myself well.

1016
01:15:26,121 --> 01:15:27,816
As you see,
it wasn't a complete failure.

1017
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:29,187
The Emperor!

1018
01:15:35,797 --> 01:15:38,595
Well, Elisa,
you look as sullen as ever.

1019
01:15:40,135 --> 01:15:44,265
- You're still sulking, l see.
- l'm not sulking, Sire, l'm outraged.

1020
01:15:44,339 --> 01:15:46,000
There have been insults.

1021
01:15:46,074 --> 01:15:48,565
lnsults? Affronts!

1022
01:15:49,778 --> 01:15:52,941
Your boss doesn't do things halfway.

1023
01:15:53,015 --> 01:15:56,781
A crown for each of us.
lt sounds funny, doesn't it?

1024
01:15:56,852 --> 01:16:00,151
- Considering my states of service...
- Yes, but even so.

1025
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:02,952
What's so incredible about it?
l followed procedure:

1026
01:16:03,025 --> 01:16:07,257
sergeant, captain, commander, colonel,
general, marshal, duke and king.

1027
01:16:07,329 --> 01:16:10,264
- l have seniority!
- Yes, my Zi-Zig. Zi-Zig l.

1028
01:16:10,332 --> 01:16:13,563
- Mind your behavior, you're a queen.
- That's true.

1029
01:16:14,937 --> 01:16:19,397
Do you realize we're 200 meters away
from my old shop?

1030
01:16:19,474 --> 01:16:23,103
We traveled 200 meters
and it didn't seem very long.

1031
01:16:23,178 --> 01:16:26,511
A dream, August 10.
Do you remember that heat?

1032
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:31,417
You were ready to lose your life to take
the Tuileries and kick the king out.

1033
01:16:31,486 --> 01:16:35,115
Now we're in the Tuileries
and l'm the king.

1034
01:16:37,159 --> 01:16:39,218
How are we going to reign?

1035
01:16:39,294 --> 01:16:41,353
You just have to give orders,
l'm used to that.

1036
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:43,762
What's a kingdom, after all,
but a big barracks?

1037
01:16:43,832 --> 01:16:46,767
This damn train follows me around
like a small dog.

1038
01:16:46,835 --> 01:16:49,804
Give me your hand.

1039
01:16:49,871 --> 01:16:51,736
This is how we'll walk
in the middle of my people.

1040
01:16:51,807 --> 01:16:54,298
- Your people?
- Our people, our subjects.

1041
01:16:54,376 --> 01:16:56,606
There's no mistake
you'll make a good despot.

1042
01:16:56,678 --> 01:16:59,044
l know my profession well.

1043
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:02,982
We have to make a mark on history.
To do so, we just have to get noticed.

1044
01:17:04,653 --> 01:17:06,746
l'll have a personal guard...

1045
01:17:06,822 --> 01:17:10,349
yes, two meters tall,
dressed in yellow.

1046
01:17:10,425 --> 01:17:11,892
And everyone will use our money,

1047
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:15,452
your profile on one side of the coin,
my profile on the other.

1048
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:19,967
You'll have maids of honor
and you'll never have to curtsey again.

1049
01:17:20,035 --> 01:17:22,094
They'll curtsey for you.

1050
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:25,503
That's all very nice,
but l don't want to leave Paris.

1051
01:17:25,574 --> 01:17:28,202
As the sovereign,
you're obliged to your new country.

1052
01:17:28,276 --> 01:17:31,643
- l don't want to be Westphalian.
- You have to do what's required.

1053
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:35,844
As long as we don't part.

1054
01:17:35,917 --> 01:17:39,444
You may be king, but l don't love you
any more than before.

1055
01:17:39,521 --> 01:17:42,081
l had the feeling l couldn't love you
any more than l did.

1056
01:17:42,157 --> 01:17:45,354
l know, l know.
Would you quit harping on about that?

1057
01:17:45,427 --> 01:17:47,190
Come on, you bumbling idiot,

1058
01:17:47,262 --> 01:17:49,992
if the Duchess of Danzig
spoke to your sisters irreverently,

1059
01:17:50,065 --> 01:17:52,363
it's because they asked for it.

1060
01:17:52,434 --> 01:17:54,800
Sire, it's not about them,
it's about me.

1061
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:59,136
No, l don't want to talk about you.

1062
01:17:59,207 --> 01:18:02,370
l've made my decision and that's that.

1063
01:18:02,444 --> 01:18:05,072
Lefebvre shall be king.

1064
01:18:05,147 --> 01:18:06,978
Segur...

1065
01:18:07,049 --> 01:18:10,541
you will seat the Westphalians
in a row according to age.

1066
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:13,179
The ceremony will commence
10 minutes after the parade.

1067
01:18:13,255 --> 01:18:15,655
The orders have been given, Sire.

1068
01:18:15,724 --> 01:18:19,455
Did Your Majesty
read the foreign press this morning?

1069
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:20,927
What does ''The Times'' say?

1070
01:18:20,996 --> 01:18:25,933
Like the others, pure garbage
about the duchess and your sisters.

1071
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:31,901
What do you want me to do about
my sisters' poor reputation? Let's go!

1072
01:18:40,248 --> 01:18:42,876
The English press is mistaken

1073
01:18:42,951 --> 01:18:45,249
to implicate you personally
in this affair.

1074
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:46,947
lmplicate me? ln what law?

1075
01:18:47,022 --> 01:18:49,047
Please read me
some of that wretched slander.

1076
01:18:49,124 --> 01:18:50,921
l couldn't insult you so.

1077
01:18:50,992 --> 01:18:53,586
An article entitled ''The Emperor
of Buffoons and the Queen of Fishwives.''

1078
01:18:53,662 --> 01:18:55,789
l can't repeat such dreadful things.

1079
01:18:55,864 --> 01:18:59,823
They even dared call the Tuileries Ball
the Barriers Ball. Despicable.

1080
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:04,565
They insinuated that you
were putting a fishwife on the throne.

1081
01:19:04,639 --> 01:19:06,197
A fishwife, for heaven's sake.

1082
01:19:06,274 --> 01:19:08,868
They claim that you're
the laughingstock of Europe.

1083
01:19:08,944 --> 01:19:12,175
They also dared to put
outrageous language in writing.

1084
01:19:12,247 --> 01:19:15,375
Justifiable, however,
considering the duchess' own words.

1085
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:20,149
They say, as she did,
that you found your marshals in the mud,

1086
01:19:20,222 --> 01:19:23,851
and that you picked your crown up
from the blood of your victims.

1087
01:19:24,893 --> 01:19:27,521
Let's see, ''Emperor of Cemeteries...

1088
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:31,032
Blood-Soaked Clown.'' lt's loathsome.

1089
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:35,593
The poor Duchess of Danzig could not
have known that her tactless remarks

1090
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:38,833
would provoke
such a spectacular scandal.

1091
01:19:38,907 --> 01:19:42,399
Alas, tonight she will be queen,
and look who will console her.

1092
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:20,092
- Lefebvre.
- Sire.

1093
01:22:20,168 --> 01:22:23,160
Listen to me. Your wife has made it
very clear that she is not worthy

1094
01:22:23,238 --> 01:22:25,365
of the high functions
that were destined to her.

1095
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:28,238
Thus, l've decided that you
will divorce her as soon as possible

1096
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:30,437
and that you will marry
the Margrave of Sandomir,

1097
01:22:30,512 --> 01:22:33,037
one of the most illustrious
families of the Holy Empire.

1098
01:23:07,749 --> 01:23:11,082
Lefebvre! Are we going?
lt's happening now, isn't it?

1099
01:23:13,621 --> 01:23:16,886
Now, yes.
Let's go sit down for five minutes.

1100
01:23:20,495 --> 01:23:24,329
- What's going on? Tell me!
- Nothing, sit down.

1101
01:23:26,334 --> 01:23:29,667
So what did the emperor
say to you?

1102
01:23:29,738 --> 01:23:32,502
You were as serious as popes,
both of you.

1103
01:23:32,574 --> 01:23:35,839
Although popes on horses
would be pretty strange.

1104
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:37,468
Listen, Catherine.

1105
01:23:40,048 --> 01:23:42,949
What is it? You seem upset.

1106
01:23:44,152 --> 01:23:47,349
- l love you, you know.
- Me too.

1107
01:23:47,422 --> 01:23:52,382
l'm so happy. l get the feeling
it's only just begun for you and me.

1108
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:54,894
lf l hurt you, would you
hold it against me?

1109
01:23:54,963 --> 01:23:58,558
No, because you wouldn't have done it
on purpose, being as clumsy as you are.

1110
01:23:59,901 --> 01:24:02,802
So did you hurt me?

1111
01:24:04,205 --> 01:24:06,969
- lt's not my fault, you know.
- ls it that serious?

1112
01:24:08,943 --> 01:24:10,706
The emperor doesn't want you
to be queen.

1113
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:14,545
That's it! And why not?

1114
01:24:14,616 --> 01:24:16,481
Because of what you said
the other night.

1115
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:18,985
- All right.
- Someone told him.

1116
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:21,420
- So?
- He wasn't pleased.

1117
01:24:21,489 --> 01:24:23,855
The English press used that to mock him.
He doesn't like that.

1118
01:24:23,925 --> 01:24:27,588
What's it to him?
He doesn't even speak English.

1119
01:24:27,662 --> 01:24:30,392
You weren't too attached
to the crown anyway.

1120
01:24:30,465 --> 01:24:33,662
That's true.
l found it too big for my small head.

1121
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:36,135
After all, there are a lot of people
who aren't kings, right?

1122
01:24:37,672 --> 01:24:40,402
So he wants to crown you without me?

1123
01:24:40,475 --> 01:24:42,238
Yes.

1124
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:44,175
There's more to it than that.

1125
01:24:44,245 --> 01:24:45,735
- Yes.
- What?

1126
01:24:47,949 --> 01:24:49,917
He wants us to get divorced.

1127
01:24:51,686 --> 01:24:53,085
Get divorced?

1128
01:24:55,990 --> 01:24:58,458
The grandeur has gone to his head.

1129
01:24:59,594 --> 01:25:03,724
And what did he say when you refused?
What did he say?

1130
01:25:09,637 --> 01:25:12,902
Hey, Lefebvre. Look at me.

1131
01:25:12,974 --> 01:25:16,535
He ordered you to leave me
and you said yes?

1132
01:25:16,611 --> 01:25:19,546
- l didn't say yes.
- So you said no?

1133
01:25:19,614 --> 01:25:21,047
l didn't say yes.

1134
01:25:23,918 --> 01:25:25,647
You didn't say anything.

1135
01:25:26,688 --> 01:25:27,985
You didn't say anything.

1136
01:25:28,056 --> 01:25:29,751
You think it's easy
to say no to the emperor,

1137
01:25:29,824 --> 01:25:32,088
after saying yes for 15 years?

1138
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:33,650
No one has ever said no to him.

1139
01:25:33,728 --> 01:25:35,787
Then you would have been the first.

1140
01:25:35,864 --> 01:25:38,162
l would've liked to have seen you there.

1141
01:25:38,233 --> 01:25:41,100
He would have listened to me.

1142
01:25:41,169 --> 01:25:44,468
He would have seen
that l'm a woman who loves her man.

1143
01:25:44,539 --> 01:25:47,975
l would have told him, ''l have
my Lefebvre and l'm keeping him.

1144
01:25:50,044 --> 01:25:52,945
We've been living together
for too long.

1145
01:25:53,014 --> 01:25:55,812
We've been too happy,
we've suffered too much together

1146
01:25:55,884 --> 01:25:58,785
to be separated like that.''

1147
01:25:58,853 --> 01:26:01,344
That's what you should have said
to your emperor...

1148
01:26:02,924 --> 01:26:04,653
if you loved me
as much as l love you.

1149
01:26:04,726 --> 01:26:06,353
Catherine.

1150
01:26:08,396 --> 01:26:12,230
Tell me you're not mad at me.
Don't cry.

1151
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:16,634
- l'm not.
- Hello there. Are you ready?

1152
01:26:16,704 --> 01:26:19,172
When you're seated on your throne,

1153
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:21,572
l'll no longer be able
to pinch your bottom.

1154
01:26:21,643 --> 01:26:24,271
A queen's bottom. My queen!

1155
01:26:24,345 --> 01:26:27,473
You always make me laugh.

1156
01:26:27,549 --> 01:26:30,450
l see that you're emotional right now.
That's understandable.

1157
01:26:30,518 --> 01:26:33,009
You're not king every day.

1158
01:26:33,087 --> 01:26:35,021
Tomorrow
she won't think about it again.

1159
01:26:35,089 --> 01:26:36,818
See you soon, friends.

1160
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:42,826
- l'm a bastard.
- Yes.

1161
01:26:44,732 --> 01:26:47,428
l haven't told you everything.

1162
01:26:47,502 --> 01:26:49,993
He also wants me to marry
a margrave.

1163
01:26:50,071 --> 01:26:53,734
Yes, a princess.
A Westphalian, to top it all off.

1164
01:26:53,808 --> 01:26:56,436
l don't know what she looks like.
l've never seen her.

1165
01:26:56,511 --> 01:26:59,503
All this falls on my head
at the same time--

1166
01:26:59,581 --> 01:27:03,039
a crown, a throne, a divorce, a wife.

1167
01:27:03,117 --> 01:27:05,585
l'm really having a rough time.

1168
01:27:05,653 --> 01:27:09,419
He announced all this on the horse.
Yes, on the horse.

1169
01:27:12,527 --> 01:27:15,587
Catherine. l love you!

1170
01:27:15,663 --> 01:27:17,460
l've never loved you so much, l swear.

1171
01:27:17,532 --> 01:27:20,092
l love you more
than anything in the world.

1172
01:27:20,168 --> 01:27:25,037
The emperor, when he's across from me,
it's like there's no one else.

1173
01:27:25,106 --> 01:27:27,472
lt's true, he intimidates me.

1174
01:27:27,542 --> 01:27:31,444
l don't know what l wouldn't give
to be a sergeant again. Yes, a sergeant.

1175
01:27:31,512 --> 01:27:33,776
Marshal, sir. The gentlemen
are waiting for Your Majesty.

1176
01:27:41,456 --> 01:27:45,290
- What should l do?
- Go fetch your little crown.

1177
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:49,228
- Catherine...
- Hurry, you'll get scolded.

1178
01:27:49,297 --> 01:27:51,788
Marshal, sir. Marshal, sir.

1179
01:28:44,218 --> 01:28:47,381
lf Your Majesty
would please be seated.

1180
01:29:01,369 --> 01:29:03,803
- ls that Marshal Lefebvre?
- Yes, Your Highness.

1181
01:29:03,871 --> 01:29:05,702
He's an attractive man.

1182
01:29:10,378 --> 01:29:11,367
Hey.

1183
01:29:13,614 --> 01:29:17,050
- Who's that?
- Your future wife, the margrave.

1184
01:29:31,499 --> 01:29:35,162
- What are we waiting for?
- The emperor.

1185
01:29:35,236 --> 01:29:37,500
Yes, of course. The emperor.

1186
01:30:43,271 --> 01:30:46,729
- Yes, Sire, it's me.
- Finally.

1187
01:30:46,808 --> 01:30:49,800
You've come to give me your belated
apologies, but it's too late, madame.

1188
01:30:49,877 --> 01:30:51,708
- But, Sire--
- Do not interrupt.

1189
01:30:51,779 --> 01:30:54,873
Did you think my court
was a fish market?

1190
01:30:54,949 --> 01:30:57,110
Did you think you could make me
the laughingstock of England?

1191
01:30:57,185 --> 01:31:00,951
- l didn't mean to--
- Sit down! Sit down.

1192
01:31:02,723 --> 01:31:06,090
- l suppose you know about my decision?
- Yes.

1193
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:08,594
''Yes, Sire,
with your permission.''

1194
01:31:10,164 --> 01:31:13,827
- What did you say in response?
- Sire, l laughed in his face.

1195
01:31:16,204 --> 01:31:19,435
- Laughed in his face?
- Laughed, Sire. ln his face, Sire.

1196
01:31:19,507 --> 01:31:21,839
-Yes?
- He laughed harder than l did, Sire.

1197
01:31:22,977 --> 01:31:25,605
Yes. No one laughs
in my face, madame!

1198
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:32,417
Come on!
People are too scared of you.

1199
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:35,149
A wink of Your Majesty's eye
makes all of Europe tremble.

1200
01:31:35,223 --> 01:31:38,454
Except that l'm not Europe,
and l won't let you divide me up.

1201
01:31:38,526 --> 01:31:40,494
l'm Lefebvre's wife. lmagine that.

1202
01:31:40,561 --> 01:31:43,428
And if you think you can make a widow
out of me without my permission--

1203
01:31:43,498 --> 01:31:47,093
Enough!
That behavior is unacceptable.

1204
01:31:47,168 --> 01:31:51,400
You are lucky. Yes, you are lucky
to have been Lefebvre's wife.

1205
01:31:51,472 --> 01:31:53,463
But do not take advantage
of the situation.

1206
01:31:53,541 --> 01:31:56,101
The punishment can exceed
the gravity of the offense.

1207
01:31:56,177 --> 01:31:59,476
Relax.
Weigh your words, like me.

1208
01:31:59,547 --> 01:32:01,640
Later you'll regret saying too much.

1209
01:32:01,716 --> 01:32:03,843
Return Lefebvre to me
and let's leave it at that.

1210
01:32:03,918 --> 01:32:06,910
Return him to me because
you'll have to give him up anyway.

1211
01:32:06,988 --> 01:32:11,652
- Give him up? Me? Watch your words.
- Yes, Sire, you. Think about it.

1212
01:32:11,726 --> 01:32:14,217
You can send thousands of men
off to fight each other.

1213
01:32:14,295 --> 01:32:17,287
You carve up kingdoms with your sword,
and conquer other tyrants.

1214
01:32:17,365 --> 01:32:20,266
You can do everything
except one thing:

1215
01:32:20,334 --> 01:32:22,029
Stop me from loving Lefebvre,

1216
01:32:22,103 --> 01:32:25,129
and stop Lefebvre from loving me.

1217
01:32:25,206 --> 01:32:28,369
Trust me, Sire, love is not your field.

1218
01:32:28,442 --> 01:32:31,809
You don't take any risks.
You'd lose for once.

1219
01:32:32,947 --> 01:32:35,381
l'd like to know
what Lefebvre thinks of all this.

1220
01:32:35,449 --> 01:32:38,850
He loves me without thinking about it,
like breathing.

1221
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:41,946
Why on earth
would Lefebvre replace me,

1222
01:32:42,023 --> 01:32:45,982
whom he loves, with a margrave
that he doesn't care about?

1223
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:47,891
She's a true aristocrat.

1224
01:32:47,962 --> 01:32:51,056
ln her eyes, he'll never
be more than an upstart.

1225
01:32:52,333 --> 01:32:54,665
There are glorious upstarts, madame.

1226
01:32:54,735 --> 01:32:57,898
Yes, and you would know
something about that.

1227
01:32:57,972 --> 01:33:01,999
Has the Duke of Danzig not accepted
all the honors bestowed upon him?

1228
01:33:02,076 --> 01:33:05,011
Yes, he has let himself be corrupted
by his deference to you.

1229
01:33:05,079 --> 01:33:07,206
Corrupted!

1230
01:33:07,281 --> 01:33:11,684
Your frank words may take you farther
than you can imagine, you know that?

1231
01:33:11,752 --> 01:33:13,845
Do not take advantage of my patience.

1232
01:33:13,921 --> 01:33:16,788
Your scandal alone would merit exile.

1233
01:33:16,857 --> 01:33:18,518
You have provoked a horrible scandal!

1234
01:33:18,593 --> 01:33:20,527
Yes, you can say it was a real scandal.

1235
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:23,120
- l will not tolerate it.
- And you're right.

1236
01:33:23,197 --> 01:33:26,291
No one has the right to drag your flag
in the mud, including your sisters.

1237
01:33:26,367 --> 01:33:27,391
How can you say that?

1238
01:33:27,468 --> 01:33:29,527
lt's just that when people
attack the army...

1239
01:33:29,604 --> 01:33:31,367
l served in it too.

1240
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:34,408
- You?
- That's right. l was a camp cook.

1241
01:33:34,475 --> 01:33:36,966
- No.
- And how? l was on the 15th line.

1242
01:33:37,044 --> 01:33:40,207
l didn't let go of Lefebvre.
We were in a lot of fights together.

1243
01:33:40,281 --> 01:33:42,772
You fought? You?

1244
01:33:42,850 --> 01:33:45,341
Yes, l was even decorated
on the troops' front lines

1245
01:33:45,419 --> 01:33:48,149
by that big oaf Augereau
after my second injury.

1246
01:33:48,222 --> 01:33:49,780
What? You were injured?

1247
01:33:49,857 --> 01:33:53,258
Yes, that's probably why
your sisters treated me like a tart.

1248
01:33:53,327 --> 01:33:55,056
lnjured?

1249
01:33:55,129 --> 01:33:58,326
Look, tell me l'm lying.
This is the second.

1250
01:34:03,070 --> 01:34:06,506
- lt's a very pretty injury.
- Yes, but it's not for you.

1251
01:34:06,574 --> 01:34:10,101
l won't show you the others,
they're too intimate.

1252
01:34:10,177 --> 01:34:12,111
- Hey!
- You couldn't have said that earlier?

1253
01:34:12,179 --> 01:34:15,205
- What?
- Well, now that...

1254
01:34:15,282 --> 01:34:18,376
- There's nothing to brag about.
- That explains your language.

1255
01:34:18,452 --> 01:34:21,216
You speak like a...
can l say it without offending you?

1256
01:34:21,288 --> 01:34:22,949
Like a soldier!

1257
01:34:24,258 --> 01:34:26,624
l attended your school.

1258
01:34:26,694 --> 01:34:28,559
No one has ever spoken to me
the way you have.

1259
01:34:28,629 --> 01:34:31,325
They were wrong not to.
lt might have done you some good.

1260
01:34:31,399 --> 01:34:34,266
You have a habit of airing
your dirty laundry in my chambers.

1261
01:34:34,335 --> 01:34:38,101
That was my profession,
as if you didn't know it.

1262
01:34:38,172 --> 01:34:40,800
- As if l didn't know what?
- That l was a laundress.

1263
01:34:40,875 --> 01:34:44,038
A laundress?
l liked camp cook better.

1264
01:34:44,111 --> 01:34:47,603
Perhaps. But don't tell me
you didn't recognize me.

1265
01:34:47,682 --> 01:34:50,344
l recognized you right away.

1266
01:34:50,418 --> 01:34:54,479
l was the one who washed your laundry
when you were a lieutenant.

1267
01:34:54,555 --> 01:34:56,386
The Patriotes Hollandais Hotel?

1268
01:34:56,457 --> 01:35:00,325
lt's just the two of us here.
You can remember me.

1269
01:35:00,394 --> 01:35:03,056
- No!
- Yes, my lieutenant.

1270
01:35:03,130 --> 01:35:04,927
- Sans-Gene.
- Bonaparte.

1271
01:35:05,966 --> 01:35:09,197
Yes, of course.

1272
01:35:09,270 --> 01:35:12,535
- l also said to myself--
- Yes, but you said it very quietly.

1273
01:35:12,606 --> 01:35:14,665
What a time, eh?
l only had a dozen shirts.

1274
01:35:14,742 --> 01:35:16,300
- No, two.
- Two dozen?

1275
01:35:16,377 --> 01:35:18,971
Two shirts,
one of which was whole.

1276
01:35:19,046 --> 01:35:21,742
- Catherine.
- Yes, that's me.

1277
01:35:21,816 --> 01:35:25,684
You still owe me two Louis.
Pardon me, two Napoleons.

1278
01:35:25,753 --> 01:35:27,550
l'm terribly sorry,
l don't have them on me.

1279
01:35:27,621 --> 01:35:29,782
That's okay,
l can wait a little longer.

1280
01:35:29,857 --> 01:35:33,224
Catherine! Can this be?

1281
01:35:33,294 --> 01:35:36,786
Don't flatter me.
You're the one who's changed, not me.

1282
01:35:36,864 --> 01:35:39,162
You think so?
Did l age? Put on weight?

1283
01:35:39,233 --> 01:35:41,360
No, you became more grand.

1284
01:35:41,435 --> 01:35:45,064
No, you've changed.
You became friendly two minutes ago.

1285
01:35:45,139 --> 01:35:47,801
With Lieutenant Bonaparte, yes.

1286
01:35:47,875 --> 01:35:51,538
- You liked Lieutenant Bonaparte?
- l would have.

1287
01:35:51,612 --> 01:35:54,046
He looked like a prune.

1288
01:35:54,115 --> 01:35:56,481
l liked prunes.

1289
01:35:56,550 --> 01:35:58,450
That's all in the past, though.

1290
01:35:58,519 --> 01:36:01,716
We were all more casual back then.

1291
01:36:01,789 --> 01:36:02,847
- You know--
- Sorry?

1292
01:36:02,923 --> 01:36:05,391
Darn! Your Majesty, l'm sorry.

1293
01:36:05,459 --> 01:36:07,689
Yes, l didn't always eat
until l was full in those days.

1294
01:36:07,762 --> 01:36:11,198
You're wrong about that,
you ate a whole world.

1295
01:36:11,265 --> 01:36:15,201
Does Your Majesty remember
when they fired a cannon from my place?

1296
01:36:15,269 --> 01:36:19,399
You asked me to come chase the rebels
out of your courtyard!

1297
01:36:19,473 --> 01:36:21,065
l played quite a trick on you, didn't l?

1298
01:36:21,142 --> 01:36:23,167
Yes, you got a good laugh
out of that one.

1299
01:36:24,712 --> 01:36:26,976
- My gate!
- What gate?

1300
01:36:27,047 --> 01:36:30,107
What gate?
You took my gate right off.

1301
01:36:31,185 --> 01:36:34,211
That's right!
And l'm sure you weren't very happy.

1302
01:36:34,288 --> 01:36:38,554
You didn't want to open it for me.
What a story.

1303
01:36:38,626 --> 01:36:42,118
And the idiot that l taught to aim!

1304
01:36:42,196 --> 01:36:43,720
Who knows where
he stole the cannon from?

1305
01:36:43,798 --> 01:36:46,198
He couldn't even use it!

1306
01:36:46,267 --> 01:36:49,930
You made that half-wit
the Marshal of France.

1307
01:36:50,004 --> 01:36:52,495
- lt was Lefebvre.
- That oaf was Lefebvre?

1308
01:36:52,573 --> 01:36:55,440
Precisely. And you were going
to make that oaf king.

1309
01:36:55,509 --> 01:36:57,807
Fortunately,
you've changed your mind.

1310
01:36:57,878 --> 01:37:01,678
- Because l've changed my mind.
- Yes, didn't you know it?

1311
01:37:01,749 --> 01:37:04,115
l also rescind
your separation from Lefebvre.

1312
01:37:04,185 --> 01:37:07,052
- Since he's no longer King.
- Women.

1313
01:37:07,121 --> 01:37:09,180
When will l learn
to resist their charms?

1314
01:37:09,256 --> 01:37:12,225
Thank you!
Thank you, my lieutenant.

1315
01:37:12,293 --> 01:37:13,783
You must admit you're glad l came.

1316
01:37:13,861 --> 01:37:16,455
But what will people think?

1317
01:37:16,530 --> 01:37:19,590
l certainly can't
give the crown to Jerome.

1318
01:37:19,667 --> 01:37:23,933
Yes, you can. What's the difference?
One more king, one less king.

1319
01:37:24,004 --> 01:37:26,837
Jerome doesn't know what to do
with himself. That'll keep him busy.

1320
01:37:26,907 --> 01:37:29,637
- Enter!
- Your Majesty, the King of Westphalia.

1321
01:37:29,710 --> 01:37:34,340
Sire, please forgive me
for storming in like this,

1322
01:37:34,415 --> 01:37:37,976
but l can't do this anymore.
l've always obeyed Your Majesty.

1323
01:37:38,052 --> 01:37:41,078
l said nothing when you made me
a general. Or a marshal.

1324
01:37:41,155 --> 01:37:44,682
Or a duke. l've never protested.

1325
01:37:44,758 --> 01:37:46,623
But today l can't take it anymore.

1326
01:37:46,694 --> 01:37:49,595
l'm here to hand in my resignation.
For king, duke, everything.

1327
01:37:49,663 --> 01:37:53,258
l don't want to marry the margrave.
l can't help it.

1328
01:37:53,334 --> 01:37:55,029
l love my wife, Sire.

1329
01:37:55,102 --> 01:37:58,037
l know she's an idiot,
but what can you do?

1330
01:37:58,105 --> 01:38:00,073
lt's not a crime, after all.

1331
01:38:00,140 --> 01:38:03,473
Look to your left, Marshal.

1332
01:38:03,544 --> 01:38:06,809
Go on, kiss her. She defeated me.
lt's the first battle l've lost.

1333
01:38:06,881 --> 01:38:10,647
- And l hope it's not the last!
- Lefebvre!

1334
01:38:12,286 --> 01:38:14,686
And l was going to make him a king!

1335
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:19,485
You're excused now.

1336
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:20,686
Your audience is concluded.

1337
01:38:22,296 --> 01:38:26,232
- Yes.
- l believe we have nothing more to say.

1338
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:29,235
lndeed, madame.
l believe you have told me everything.

1339
01:38:38,646 --> 01:38:43,583
THE END
