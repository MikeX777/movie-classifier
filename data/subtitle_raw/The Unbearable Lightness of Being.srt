So...

752
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:50,156
l hope you're
not having a bad time.

753
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:52,283
Oh, not at all, no.

754
01:14:52,367 --> 01:14:55,912
l have a train
to catch in an hour.

755
01:14:55,995 --> 01:14:59,082
You travel by train?

756
01:14:59,165 --> 01:15:01,126
Always.

757
01:15:01,209 --> 01:15:03,128
l love trains.

758
01:15:03,169 --> 01:15:05,255
They are so erotic.

759
01:15:35,702 --> 01:15:39,247
By the way, my wife
owns an art gallery.

760
01:15:39,330 --> 01:15:41,666
Maybe she could
help you.

761
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:43,793
Oh, you are married?

762
01:15:46,254 --> 01:15:47,505
Yes.

763
01:15:56,556 --> 01:15:59,017
Watch out!

764
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:01,102
Be careful.

765
01:16:20,789 --> 01:16:22,040
Mmm.

766
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:25,543
Ha ha ha!

767
01:16:53,446 --> 01:16:54,906
Uhh.

768
01:16:54,989 --> 01:16:56,908
Oh. Oh.

771
01:17:23,143 --> 01:17:24,436
Ahem.

772
01:17:28,148 --> 01:17:30,442
Well, welcome to Geneva.

773
01:17:35,321 --> 01:17:37,073
Well, that's good work,

774
01:17:37,157 --> 01:17:39,409
but it's too late.

775
01:17:39,492 --> 01:17:41,119
Russians in Prague--

776
01:17:41,202 --> 01:17:43,371
We've seen these
everywhere.

777
01:17:43,455 --> 01:17:45,915
The events are
too remote now.

778
01:17:45,999 --> 01:17:47,751
lt's over.

779
01:17:47,792 --> 01:17:51,379
But there,
nothing is over.

780
01:17:51,463 --> 01:17:55,300
Everybody--Everybody still demands
that the Russians leave.

781
01:17:55,383 --> 01:18:00,013
There are strikes all over
the country, and protests,

782
01:18:00,096 --> 01:18:04,601
but here, nobody
seems to care anymore.

783
01:18:04,684 --> 01:18:06,478
Here's the story

784
01:18:06,519 --> 01:18:08,480
about the nudists
in France.

785
01:18:08,563 --> 01:18:10,482
Oh, thank you.

786
01:18:10,565 --> 01:18:12,484
Wait. Just have
a look--

787
01:18:12,567 --> 01:18:14,486
superb photographs
of Prague.

788
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:17,489
lt's a pity
we're just getting them now.

[Telephone Rings]

790
01:18:19,699 --> 01:18:21,493
Have a look
at mine.

791
01:18:21,534 --> 01:18:24,788
They have nothing
to do with yours.

792
01:18:37,550 --> 01:18:39,177
Not at all.

793
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:42,138
They are the same.

794
01:18:42,222 --> 01:18:44,265
Nothing's wrong
with the body.

795
01:18:44,349 --> 01:18:46,726
lt's normal...

796
01:18:46,810 --> 01:18:49,020
and everything normal
is beautiful.

797
01:18:51,147 --> 01:18:55,902
You have a terrific sense
of the female body.

798
01:18:57,946 --> 01:19:00,490
These provocative poses.

799
01:19:00,573 --> 01:19:03,493
You'd be a topnotch
fashion photographer.

800
01:19:03,576 --> 01:19:06,037
You ought to
get a model,

801
01:19:06,079 --> 01:19:07,872
make a portfolio
for agencies.

802
01:19:07,914 --> 01:19:12,043
l'll introduce you to the editor
of our garden section.

803
01:19:12,085 --> 01:19:13,712
Yeah, sure.

804
01:19:13,795 --> 01:19:16,965
They always need shots
of cactuses and roses.

805
01:19:17,048 --> 01:19:18,758
Cactuses?

806
01:19:20,343 --> 01:19:21,761
No.

807
01:19:21,845 --> 01:19:23,638
You're too kind,
really,

808
01:19:23,722 --> 01:19:27,475
but l'd rather be
a waitress or stay home.

809
01:19:27,559 --> 01:19:31,646
But will you be fulfilled
sitting at home?

What am l
going to do,

813
01:19:42,323 --> 01:19:46,870
take pictures
of naked women?

814
01:19:51,624 --> 01:19:55,211
Why does everybody want
to see pictures of naked women?

815
01:19:55,253 --> 01:19:59,132
Are they
that interesting?

816
01:19:59,215 --> 01:20:00,425
Hmm?

817
01:20:19,152 --> 01:20:20,236
Blah!

818
01:20:22,530 --> 01:20:23,948
See you later.

this afternoon?

Yes, l'll be back late.

Yes, l suppose so.

822

Good.

823
01:21:47,574 --> 01:21:50,660
Come with me
to Amsterdam in two days.

824
01:21:50,744 --> 01:21:52,704
l've seen
Amsterdam.

825
01:21:52,746 --> 01:21:54,914
You have?

826
01:21:54,998 --> 01:21:57,375
A friend of mine
sent me

827
01:21:57,417 --> 01:21:59,377
a post card
from there.

828
01:21:59,419 --> 01:22:01,713
lt's taped up
over my toilet.

829
01:22:01,796 --> 01:22:03,840
Haven't you noticed?

830
01:22:08,261 --> 01:22:09,846
Tell me, Franz...

831
01:22:09,929 --> 01:22:13,391
why do you always
take me to another city?

832
01:22:13,433 --> 01:22:16,728
Why won't you make love
to me in Geneva?

833
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:18,396
l told you.

834
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:20,231
Tell me again.

835
01:22:20,273 --> 01:22:23,735
Because l couldn't go to bed
with my wife.

836
01:22:23,777 --> 01:22:26,738
You couldn't go
from one bed to another?

837
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:28,740
That's right.

838
01:22:28,823 --> 01:22:30,241
Why?

839
01:22:30,283 --> 01:22:33,745
l feel it would be
humiliating to my wife,

840
01:22:33,787 --> 01:22:35,872
to me,
and to you.

841
01:22:37,791 --> 01:22:39,751
lt might seem
ridiculous,

the way it is.

He's the best man
l've ever met.

Ha ha ha!
Oh.

He's bright,
handsome, good...

And he's crazy about me.

There's only one thing.

He doesn't like
my hat.

872
01:25:20,453 --> 01:25:22,122
Your hat.

873
01:25:23,206 --> 01:25:27,877
Your hat makes me
want to cry, Sabina.

01:25:40,932 --> 01:25:42,183
