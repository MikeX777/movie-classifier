110
00:09:32,762 --> 00:09:33,762

verily I say unto you this generation

269
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:24,928
shall not pass till all these things be

270
00:24:25,198 --> 00:24:26,289

274
00:24:33,942 --> 00:24:35,952
dead aren't they I mean the whole bang a

275
00:24:36,219 --> 00:24:39,929
lot of them so are you implying brother

276
00:24:40,246 --> 00:24:42,357
now Lord was mistaken no I just mean

277
00:24:42,626 --> 00:24:44,076
that if all the Bible's true and we

278
00:24:44,325 --> 00:24:45,415
believe that and this is not true well

279
00:24:45,654 --> 00:24:48,214
it makes the whole thing so go on

280
00:24:48,497 --> 00:24:50,187

281
00:24:50,443 --> 00:24:51,803
no no no it's just a question enough I

282
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:53,889
think there should be an answer in there

283
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:56,711
how do you know brother that there may

284
00:24:56,994 --> 00:25:00,903

00:25:10,033 --> 00:25:12,562
such man has survived that generation

289
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:17,564

290
00:25:17,911 --> 00:25:22,241

291
00:25:22,577 --> 00:25:25,107

those four terrible days for brethren

370
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:43,639
the great tempter is ever at the door

371
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:46,631

372
00:33:46,917 --> 00:33:49,416
encounter his infamous Caliban yay

373
00:33:49,697 --> 00:33:53,097
verily in the vacant lot across the road

374
00:33:53,405 --> 00:33:56,436
a mere 100 yards from where I stand and

375
00:33:56,733 --> 00:33:57,733
the Lord presides

376
00:33:57,969 --> 00:34:04,928
and sisters the Lord enjoins us against

377
00:34:07,866 --> 00:34:10,666
all violence even unto who death must we

378
00:34:10,955 --> 00:34:14,775
turn the other cheek show courtesy and

379
00:34:15,096 --> 00:34:18,606
civility but never let his evil doctrine

380
00:34:18,917 --> 00:34:19,917
into our hearts

381
00:34:36,807 --> 00:34:42,097

00:50:01,772 --> 00:50:02,801
each other for a while I know I could go

511
00:50:03,038 --> 00:50:04,369

00:50:04,615 --> 00:50:07,624

00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:39,888
equally happy whatever we do in life

601
00:57:40,164 --> 00:57:41,914

603
00:58:02,473 --> 00:58:04,613
time I had it away with her of course it

604
00:58:04,883 --> 00:58:12,883

738
01:07:54,915 --> 01:07:58,674

don't you see just that tropical lie

740
01:08:01,466 --> 01:08:02,794

after years of revolting intimacy brain

748
01:08:33,848 --> 01:08:37,578
numbing contortions of needless belief

749
01:08:37,896 --> 01:08:38,896
I've decided to beyond hope

750
01:08:39,132 --> 01:08:42,691
fight for me my caste all either uni

751
01:08:43,003 --> 01:08:45,414
rational people are asking me for you

also a rapist as a child after we've met

753
01:08:47,916 --> 01:08:49,696
upon reflection you probably work well

754
01:08:49,955 --> 01:08:51,735
just that one night apart from which

755
01:08:51,995 --> 01:08:54,165
I've been offered a room rent-free by

756
01:08:54,436 --> 01:08:56,546
rich patroness of ERT thinks I'm a poet

757
01:08:56,815 --> 01:09:00,295
all right

758
01:09:00,605 --> 01:09:01,605
she'll pull the wool out of her ass

759
01:09:01,841 --> 01:09:05,902
see

760
01:09:06,230 --> 01:09:08,099
my world seemed to be falling apart my

761
01:09:08,361 --> 01:09:09,872
best maid at school and my best mate at

762
01:09:10,123 --> 01:09:11,962
church didn't like me anymore

763
01:09:12,223 --> 01:09:14,183
I was prevented by court order from

764
01:09:14,448 --> 01:09:16,438
raping the girl I loved and reduced to

765
01:09:16,703 --> 01:09:21,303
having philosophical conversations in a

766
01:09:21,647 --> 01:09:23,548
strip joint with a cannibal on the sofa

767
01:09:23,811 --> 01:09:25,680
room and with some money mum got from

768
01:09:25,942 --> 01:09:28,112
selling her old car I put a down payment

769
01:09:28,383 --> 01:09:30,583
on a television set which in turn became

770
01:09:30,855 --> 01:09:32,215
the author of my doom and a tape

771
01:09:32,462 --> 01:09:38,532
recorder on which I practiced my

772
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:44,590
Laurence Olivier imitation I went about

773
01:09:44,965 --> 01:09:48,976
discontent made glorious summer by this

774
01:09:49,303 --> 01:09:52,282
son of DOC all ships of any kind bound

775
01:09:52,577 --> 01:09:54,327
for Cuba from whatever nation or port

776
01:09:54,585 --> 01:09:56,606
I spent long nights on the lounge room

777
01:09:56,873 --> 01:09:58,472
floor chewing methedrine which we all

778
01:09:58,726 --> 01:10:01,557
did in those days while studying for

779
01:10:01,847 --> 01:10:03,806
exams and grinding my teeth which was

780
01:10:04,071 --> 01:10:10,862
the byproduct of the same drug later

781
01:10:11,272 --> 01:10:15,781
known as speed as never before to move

782
01:10:16,122 --> 01:10:19,762
forward it stand tall and move sideways

783
01:10:20,077 --> 01:10:23,477
and stand tall on the frontier of

784
01:10:23,784 --> 01:10:27,424
necessity in a twilight of desire to

785
01:10:27,740 --> 01:10:30,241
heed the command of Isaiah to go to the

786
01:10:30,521 --> 01:10:33,261
humble cockroach and seek his advice ask

787
01:10:33,550 --> 01:10:35,960
not what you can do for pretty girls now

788
01:10:36,238 --> 01:10:39,066
your own core is dead ask what pretty

789
01:10:39,356 --> 01:10:40,717
girls can do for you and how often and

790
01:10:40,964 --> 01:10:44,755
what in their view it's the ultimate

791
01:10:45,075 --> 01:10:46,613
cost sometimes in waking dreams there

792
01:10:46,865 --> 01:10:48,707
were certain events that came back into

793
01:10:48,968 --> 01:10:49,968
my mind from that fateful seventh day

794
01:10:50,204 --> 01:10:53,364
adventists

795
01:10:53,665 --> 01:10:57,514
camp in 1956 and furthermore in ezekiel

797
01:11:00,523 --> 01:11:02,184
but his slain men and in thy heels and

798
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:04,578
in high valleys and in all thy rivers

799
01:11:04,848 --> 01:11:06,570
shall they fall and that's we received

800
01:11:06,827 --> 01:11:11,355
the word on the first day of the ninth

801
01:11:11,697 --> 01:11:14,689
month cripes it's right so that means

802
01:11:14,985 --> 01:11:17,304
okay the seventh-day Adventist will be

803
01:11:17,579 --> 01:11:20,169
wiped out on September the first in the

804
01:11:20,453 --> 01:11:23,523
mountain where they dwell the campground

805
01:11:23,821 --> 01:11:26,470
it will be a very of dry bones

806
01:11:26,755 --> 01:11:30,157
that's next Saturday no so time is short

807
01:11:30,465 --> 01:11:31,675

808
01:11:31,917 --> 01:11:34,716
the Lord come it's like a thief in the

809
01:11:35,006 --> 01:11:36,696
night with power and great glory and

810
01:11:36,953 --> 01:11:44,102

811
01:11:44,522 --> 01:11:52,522

814
01:12:00,961 --> 01:12:02,171
under the horrific share of the

815
01:12:02,413 --> 01:12:03,713
probability of the knowledge that I'm

816
01:12:03,958 --> 01:12:07,538
writing to you of my feelings for you

817
01:12:07,851 --> 01:12:09,451
for the last time on this earth what it

818
01:12:09,705 --> 01:12:11,876
says so much about what you mean - man

819
01:12:12,147 --> 01:12:20,147
what unending happiness it's lasted a

820
01:12:29,749 --> 01:12:31,898
few days and I'd like a can of Netflix

couldn't believe it was coming to me

825
01:12:42,726 --> 01:12:43,726
maybe it wasn't but it'll write it up

826
01:12:55,774 --> 01:13:03,774
last chance in the world

827
01:13:04,551 --> 01:13:05,551

951
01:22:31,644 --> 01:22:34,056
two beautiful sisters walked away out of

952
01:22:34,334 --> 01:22:36,263
my life I wrote to Esther for the next

953
01:22:36,527 --> 01:22:38,757
two years and she wrote primly back to

954
01:22:39,030 --> 01:22:40,659
me and the next year at camp she sat

955
01:22:40,914 --> 01:22:42,455
with Allen Rawlins and the pictures a

956
01:22:42,707 --> 01:22:45,596
good clean Christian boy

957
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:47,459
whose dad was also a minister and the

958
01:22:47,712 --> 01:22:49,812
next year she didn't come because she

959
01:22:50,081 --> 01:22:52,592
was in the loony bin for a while I

960
01:22:52,874 --> 01:22:55,853
watched her walk away and knew how much

961
01:22:56,148 --> 01:22:57,628
I had lost by taking her hand being a

962
01:22:57,878 --> 01:23:00,348
seventh-day adventists was hard but it

963
01:23:00,628 --> 01:23:02,408
was kind of fair they quickly sorted out

964
01:23:02,667 --> 01:23:04,988
the ones they couldn't trust like Meryl

965
01:23:05,264 --> 01:23:08,033
and me branded us with the Mark of Cain

966
01:23:08,322 --> 01:23:12,583
and sent us wandering fugitive sinners

967
01:23:12,917 --> 01:23:13,917
through the Land of Nod for all our days

968
01:23:14,181 --> 01:23:18,261
at dawn next day after his long

969
01:23:18,590 --> 01:23:21,631
all-night vigil the Shepherd's rod

970
01:23:21,928 --> 01:23:24,128
packed up his gear and drove south he

971
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:28,390
drove to a green hill near cost Harbor

972
01:23:28,715 --> 01:23:29,715
one that he used to run on as a kid

973
01:23:46,977 --> 01:23:50,017
he walked for half a mile down long

974
01:23:50,314 --> 01:23:52,304
trodden paths towards the sea and on a

975
01:23:52,570 --> 01:23:55,339
rocky headland he used to pray on when

976
01:23:55,628 --> 01:23:58,308
he was a troubled kid like me he blew

977
01:23:58,594 --> 01:24:00,344
his head off he was a true believer you

978
01:24:00,603 --> 01:24:03,483
see he truly believed

979
01:24:05,011 --> 01:24:08,451
the next day the camp packed up and we

980
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:10,600
all went home that afternoon I went to

981
01:24:10,861 --> 01:24:13,061
see Deb in Lismore Base Hospital

982
01:24:13,333 --> 01:24:15,383
doing his deathbed scene though he lived

983
01:24:15,650 --> 01:24:20,791
for 20 more years they've never missed

984
01:24:21,151 --> 01:24:24,371
an opportunity to be memorable an

985
01:24:24,674 --> 01:24:27,803
adequate definition of love and I found

986
01:24:28,102 --> 01:24:30,332

992
01:24:54,583 --> 01:25:00,353
tongues of men and of angels and have

993
01:25:00,731 --> 01:25:05,240

like a fire which cleanses us and turns

1049
01:31:26,977 --> 01:31:31,426
it into a beautiful green place the

1050
01:31:31,765 --> 01:31:38,206

she lay there in my arms through the

1055
01:32:01,418 --> 01:32:04,699
long warm moon sometimes moving nearer

1056
01:32:05,003 --> 01:32:08,012
turning smiling in her sleep her breath

1057
01:32:08,308 --> 01:32:11,079
was the purest Pepsodent i watched with

1058
01:32:11,368 --> 01:32:12,727
burning eyes and grinding teeth and took

1059
01:32:12,974 --> 01:32:14,924
another methedrine so as to be all

1060
01:32:15,188 --> 01:32:17,849
bright and witty again when she woke up

1061
01:32:18,135 --> 01:32:20,784
why one o'clock my mind was running far

1062
01:32:21,069 --> 01:32:22,490
ahead of me I developed a desire to get

1063
01:32:22,739 --> 01:32:30,739
in some provisions for the impending

1064
01:32:46,869 --> 01:32:49,221
atomic attack it's not true Catholic

1065
01:32:49,497 --> 01:32:50,497

1067
01:32:51,969 --> 01:32:53,708

1068
01:32:53,966 --> 01:32:54,966
champagne

1069
01:33:00,650 --> 01:33:05,480
I couldn't believe it Sydney had to be

1070
01:33:05,831 --> 01:33:07,221
the prime target area in the southern

1071
01:33:07,469 --> 01:33:09,849
hemisphere and everyone was sustained

1072
01:33:10,126 --> 01:33:11,575
portable exactly the kind of place they

1073
01:33:11,824 --> 01:33:13,906
bombed showing in business

1074
01:33:14,175 --> 01:33:16,673
I walked down familiar streets for an

1075
01:33:16,954 --> 01:33:19,485
hour and then other streets I saw people

1076
01:33:19,766 --> 01:33:24,686
walking shopping I saw things very

1077
01:33:24,835 --> 01:33:25,835
clearly and then I knew what I must do

1078
01:33:41,025 --> 01:33:49,025

I don't like Japanese ballet and there

1131
01:36:55,513 --> 01:36:57,832
are ships moving towards each other in

1132
01:36:58,107 --> 01:37:00,606
the Caribbean Sea this is lovely

1133
01:37:00,887 --> 01:37:02,187
nuclear submarines Mitchum's really got

something and that's all I'm gonna do a

1135

end of the movie no come on now a

1140
01:37:25,978 --> 01:37:31,558
Callister it's fruitless to say a bitten

1141
01:37:31,931 --> 01:37:34,951
and desirable to pronounce it correctly

1142
01:37:35,247 --> 01:37:36,247
forever and forever farewell Brutus if

1143
01:37:36,483 --> 01:37:37,604
you meet again

1144
01:37:37,844 --> 01:37:40,163
then we shall smile if not why then this

1145
01:37:40,438 --> 01:37:44,068
party was rolling you took the words

1146
01:37:44,383 --> 01:37:45,383
right out of my mouth what do you mean

1147
01:38:02,778 --> 01:38:07,959
you're a fucking idiot

1148
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:16,198
you're not that dungeon baby

1149
01:38:17,876 --> 01:38:23,728
it's something wrong with you shut up

1150
01:38:24,110 --> 01:38:26,268
and light me a cigarette you push that

1151
01:38:26,333 --> 01:38:27,333
thing down there

1152
01:38:27,569 --> 01:38:32,088
but you don't smoke I started again

1153
01:38:43,741 --> 01:38:48,041
we drove on up through the calm spring

1154
01:38:48,375 --> 01:38:50,874
night towards Kitumba

1155
01:38:51,155 --> 01:38:52,535
I felt very heroic very much in love

1156
01:38:52,783 --> 01:38:56,794
what a crumble bar

1157
01:38:57,120 --> 01:39:00,910
no thanks hey there's no radio in this

1158
01:39:01,229 --> 01:39:03,209
car no daddy said he needed his thinking

1159
01:39:03,475 --> 01:39:04,475
time

1160
01:39:06,677 --> 01:39:11,877
the street lamps in the suburbs receded

1161
01:39:12,238 --> 01:39:14,828
behind us I thought of all the good days

1162
01:39:15,112 --> 01:39:17,973
I had had on the cricket field today

1163
01:39:18,265 --> 01:39:20,164
McAllister got his hat track my triumph

1164
01:39:20,427 --> 01:39:23,228
is bottom in our cut down high school

1165
01:39:23,517 --> 01:39:25,687
version of Midsummer Night's Dream the

1166
01:39:25,958 --> 01:39:27,797
long afternoons riding home of Whelan

1167
01:39:28,059 --> 01:39:30,620
and McAlister talking about teachers and

1168
01:39:30,902 --> 01:39:32,772
lard and girls my young people's meeting

1169
01:39:33,034 --> 01:39:35,113
about the Shroud of Turin and how the

1170
01:39:35,382 --> 01:39:40,043
resurrection was thereby proved with the

1171
01:39:40,388 --> 01:39:42,317
aid of modern science I thought of the

1172
01:39:42,581 --> 01:39:45,111
life ahead with Jenny and her Jaguar

1173
01:39:45,393 --> 01:39:48,003
radiator driving west hopping blood

1174
01:39:48,287 --> 01:39:51,738
getting married in Burke or Broken Hill

1175
01:39:52,047 --> 01:39:55,026
it felt very good somehow

1176
01:39:55,322 --> 01:39:56,623
I must have dozed off I remember the

1177
01:39:56,868 --> 01:39:59,367
methedrine lights on the back of my

1178
01:39:59,647 --> 01:40:01,308
eyelids when I woke up the car was

1179
01:40:01,564 --> 01:40:08,313
stopped and Jenny was on the verge of

1180
01:40:08,721 --> 01:40:11,582
crying what's happy

1181
01:40:11,874 --> 01:40:15,213
that's King's College Parramatta

1182
01:40:15,314 --> 01:40:16,314
Johnnie's there my brother

1183
01:40:16,550 --> 01:40:23,989
why do you ring your father yes maybe

1184
01:40:28,382 --> 01:40:29,382
once your father in the place yes

1185
01:40:30,639 --> 01:40:38,639
let's go on I began to wonder if I was

1186
01:40:44,636 --> 01:40:46,507
driving less with the wrong girl

1187
01:40:46,769 --> 01:40:48,849
she was markedly different in her mood

1188
01:40:49,117 --> 01:40:50,777
from how she was that afternoon in bed I

1189
01:40:51,033 --> 01:40:53,382
thought of her submission to her

1190
01:40:53,658 --> 01:40:55,648
father's desire to have me put in you Jo

1191
01:40:55,914 --> 01:40:57,575
I thought of rich girls in general their

1192
01:40:57,831 --> 01:41:01,351
fickleness and passion for transitory

1193
01:41:01,662 --> 01:41:03,172
thrills could I this long night be like

1194
01:41:03,423 --> 01:41:11,183
that now to her

1195
01:41:14,133 --> 01:41:18,794
on the mountaintop at a scenic lookout

1196
01:41:19,139 --> 01:41:22,389
with a handy view of the mushroom cloud

1197
01:41:22,693 --> 01:41:23,693
over Sydney we made love I changed my

1198
01:41:23,929 --> 01:41:25,680
mind

1199
01:41:25,938 --> 01:41:29,158
I knew she loved me and we were destined

1200
01:41:29,461 --> 01:41:37,461
for this moment you do it better than

1201
01:41:40,275 --> 01:41:48,135
anyone else' sippy a couple sins are you

1202
01:41:48,577 --> 01:41:51,377
angry I think it makes me more excited

1203
01:41:51,667 --> 01:41:52,667
good

1204
01:41:53,993 --> 01:41:58,832
vaguely over my shoulder I was waiting

1205
01:41:59,183 --> 01:42:02,644
for an explosion that will wipe away the

1206
01:42:02,954 --> 01:42:04,343
old world as I made love again it's

1207
01:42:04,590 --> 01:42:08,021
easier when you're 19

1208
01:42:08,330 --> 01:42:10,229
I found myself growing impatient what

1209
01:42:10,492 --> 01:42:15,423
did you think we're ready here my father

1210
01:42:15,777 --> 01:42:21,097
went in at d-day with the first wave he

1211
01:42:21,462 --> 01:42:24,472
was a war correspondent he went all the

1212
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:29,789
way with the 8th army to the Elbe linked

1213
01:42:30,146 --> 01:42:35,455
up at the Elbe he I didn't get to know

1214
01:42:35,615 --> 01:42:36,615
him better yes it is

1215
01:42:36,851 --> 01:42:40,350
he wasn't afraid of a big war

1216
01:43:15,731 --> 01:43:18,960
I didn't know

1217
01:43:27,998 --> 01:43:31,848
seven about the wall what war we're in

1218
01:43:32,170 --> 01:43:33,829
Cuba

1219
01:43:34,084 --> 01:43:35,774
Dina Conan in a ballistic missiles and

1220
01:43:36,031 --> 01:43:38,732
then ships heading towards one another

1221
01:43:39,019 --> 01:43:40,019
beats me mate

1222
01:43:43,210 --> 01:43:48,049
around with ago I realized it wasn't

1223
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:50,601
going to happen it was good news I guess

1224
01:43:50,873 --> 01:43:53,553
we could go back to Sydney and do our

1225
01:43:53,839 --> 01:43:56,009
exams get on with our careers get

1226
01:43:56,280 --> 01:43:58,421
married there suddenly that didn't seem

1227
01:43:58,691 --> 01:44:00,290
like a guy It was as though we were

1228
01:44:00,544 --> 01:44:08,544
tuned up for the end of the world and

1229
01:44:22,235 --> 01:44:23,235
nothing else wouldn't do it all

1230
01:44:32,864 --> 01:44:34,824
I'm not sure if it was the loss of his

1231
01:44:35,089 --> 01:44:37,649
daughter or the loss of his Jagua that

1232
01:44:37,932 --> 01:44:40,811
annoy data Brian the most there was a

1233
01:44:41,103 --> 01:44:42,103
rough night overall

1234
01:44:52,290 --> 01:44:53,290
are you playing fine

1235
01:44:58,644 --> 01:45:03,083
I was first charged with kidnapping and

1236
01:45:03,422 --> 01:45:05,173
then car theft and then driving without

1237
01:45:05,431 --> 01:45:07,841
a license but Jenny said that was all

1238
01:45:08,120 --> 01:45:13,859
wrong and in the end they let me go with

1239
01:45:14,237 --> 01:45:15,778
extreme bad grace I rang up Jenny and

1240
01:45:16,030 --> 01:45:17,929
asked if she'd marry me she said she

1241
01:45:18,192 --> 01:45:21,022
think about it I never heard from her

1242
01:45:21,312 --> 01:45:23,933
again I saw her across the room at the

1243
01:45:24,218 --> 01:45:25,517
exams but then she got away and the next

1244
01:45:25,762 --> 01:45:33,762
thing I heard she was on a world trip

1245
01:45:40,377 --> 01:45:42,249
with her mother I started going to

1246
01:45:42,511 --> 01:45:50,511
parties now there are other girls in the

1247
01:45:59,351 --> 01:46:04,120
world what's about then just return as

1248
01:46:04,469 --> 01:46:09,480
it was and a spirit shall return

1249
01:46:16,335 --> 01:46:19,785
auntie auntie save the preacher

1250
01:46:21,350 --> 01:46:26,060
I went north on the train to armoured I

1251
01:46:26,407 --> 01:46:28,308
obviously whale and Mary survived she

1252
01:46:28,571 --> 01:46:29,960
was a nursing sister already and

1253
01:46:30,207 --> 01:46:33,388
supporting him while he finished college

1254
01:46:41,857 --> 01:46:43,847
it was strange being welcomed there as

1255
01:46:44,113 --> 01:46:47,002
the pen friend of their crazy daughter

1256
01:46:47,294 --> 01:46:49,435
these were my own people I felt at home

1257
01:46:49,705 --> 01:46:52,535
and not at home at the same time I

1258
01:46:52,826 --> 01:47:00,826
wasn't one of them anymore but I should

1259
01:47:04,454 --> 01:47:09,653
have been hello mr. Elkin yes Thornton

1260
01:47:10,015 --> 01:47:11,015

don't do this again

1268
01:48:37,345 --> 01:48:41,476
if you would do

1269
01:48:45,719 --> 01:48:48,919
did you keep my business

1270
01:49:07,421 --> 01:49:09,441
one Sunday soon after that I got a fall

1271
01:49:09,707 --> 01:49:11,066
from Macalester and you spent the Sunday

1272
01:49:11,313 --> 01:49:13,873
together the way we used to

1273
01:49:14,156 --> 01:49:16,386
I burgled the staff club when we got in

1274
01:49:16,659 --> 01:49:19,070
drank wine and ate cheese and Jats

1275
01:49:19,348 --> 01:49:21,877
crackers and talked long hours in our

1276
01:49:22,159 --> 01:49:30,020
old companionable way eventually

1277
01:49:30,461 --> 01:49:35,700
McCallister's said My dear chap do you

1278
01:49:36,063 --> 01:49:40,214
the first day of the period from the

1279
01:49:40,544 --> 01:49:43,464
first days of period why do you ask

1280
01:49:43,758 --> 01:49:49,048
well oh no that's all it's only the 13th

1281
01:49:49,412 --> 01:49:56,041
day 13th day what's right isn't in the

1282
01:49:56,446 --> 01:49:57,446
girl no yes I think she did funny

1283
01:49:57,939 --> 01:50:02,569
Twilight came down over the quadrangle

1284
01:50:02,914 --> 01:50:04,844
by a coincidence we found a

1285
01:50:05,108 --> 01:50:06,408
contraceptive on the flagstones and we

1286
01:50:06,653 --> 01:50:09,033
blew it up and tied it off like a

1287
01:50:09,310 --> 01:50:16,070
balloon and chased it all over the

1288
01:50:16,479 --> 01:50:18,159
quadrangle hitting at it with sticks it

1289
01:50:18,415 --> 01:50:22,095
was the last day of McCallister's youth

1290
01:50:22,411 --> 01:50:25,121
it was just another day of mine some of

1291
01:50:25,408 --> 01:50:28,028
us hang on to our childhood longer some

1292
01:50:28,313 --> 01:50:30,144
of us give it up willingly I don't know

1293
01:50:30,405 --> 01:50:33,225
who is the wise

1294
01:50:39,262 --> 01:50:42,030
I think it came down to how McAllister

1295
01:50:42,319 --> 01:50:43,980
was better behaved than I was that was

1296
01:50:44,236 --> 01:50:45,776
where the Presbyterians had it over the

1297
01:50:46,028 --> 01:50:49,037
adventists when they came down to the

1298
01:50:49,333 --> 01:50:52,604
big city the Adventists by contrast had

1299
01:50:52,908 --> 01:50:56,637
this problem of fullness of response I

1300
01:50:56,955 --> 01:50:57,955
don't think I ever got over

1301
01:51:03,765 --> 01:51:08,574
we did know what I want your thought I

1302
01:51:08,924 --> 01:51:13,374
can feel you really there I can't say

1303
01:51:13,713 --> 01:51:17,052
anything I am Alpha and Omega the

1304
01:51:17,358 --> 01:51:21,059
beginning and the end man comes to the

1305
01:51:21,376 --> 01:51:24,327
Father but by me it's easy for you to

1306
01:51:24,622 --> 01:51:28,042
say we were both brought up in primitive

1307
01:51:28,350 --> 01:51:35,149

1308
01:51:35,559 --> 01:51:37,350

got fired from four newspapers on points

1314
01:51:52,709 --> 01:51:54,759
of principle fought with collaborators

1315
01:51:55,026 --> 01:51:57,286
and producers addressed political

1316
01:51:57,560 --> 01:52:00,719
rallies lost friends lost hope regained
