1
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:30,233
{\an8}- You ready. Here we go.
- Born ready. Come on.

2
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:31,691
{\an8}They're gonna be surprised.

3
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,916
{\an8}- Let's do it.
- Straighten your cane.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,541
A five, six, seven, eight.

5
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:42,291
<i>♪ Santa Claus is coming to town ♪</i>

6
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,375
<i>♪ Santa Claus is coming to town ♪</i>

7
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:48,208
<i>♪ You better watch out,
You better not cry ♪</i>

8
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:51,291
<i>♪ You better not pout

9
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,416
<i>♪ Santa Claus is coming to town ♪</i>

10
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:59,500
<i>♪ Santa Claus is coming to town ♪</i>

11
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:06,583
Hey, kids. Kids, it's time
for the annual Christmas video.

12
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:09,041
Uh, not right now, Mom.

13
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:11,625
What are you talking about?
You used to love these.

14
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:13,208
The key word being "used to."

15
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:15,572
I think we're too old for that.
It's kind of embarrassing.

16
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:18,208
How about you, buddy?
Come on. Wyatt, can you hear me?

17
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:20,000
Grab your guitar. Let's do this.

18
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:21,916
You just made me die in the Dwarf Mines.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,041
How about joining us
in the physical world?

20
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:24,958
Five minutes.

21
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:28,541
I tried the physical realm...
I will take the digital realm.

22
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:30,708
- Miles?
- Miles.

23
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,166
- You with us, buddy?
- Miles.

24
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:35,291
- Pickles.
- Where is Pickles?

25
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:38,625
- Oh God.
- Pickles.

26
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:40,708
The tree is not your territory.

27
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:43,333
Oh, honey, watch out. Your cane.
You're hooked. You're hooked.

28
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:47,375
I'm okay. We're okay.

29
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:59,958
Hey, Bill, when did this family
give up on Christmas?

30
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:02,666
New rule in this house. No more tinsel.

31
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:06,083
I mean, CC used to just love
making those holiday videos.

32
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:08,625
I mean, this stuff just gets everywhere.

33
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:12,041
And Wyatt was a natural performer.
He had moves like Jagger.

34
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:15,166
How does so much pee
come out of that tiny, little dog?

35
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,458
I worry that we're
all kind of disconnected.

36
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:19,000
Sorry, did you ask me something?

37
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:21,666
- Hmm. Sorry?
- What? Hmm.

38
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,333
- It's fine.
- I can't hear... What?

39
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:24,875
- No. No.
- Oh.

40
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:26,916
- Okay.
- Good night.

41
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,666
{\an8}<i>Good morning, Los Angeles.
Only three days till Christmas,</i>

42
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,416
{\an8}<i>and another hot holiday season
here in the Southland.</i>

43
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,833
<i>Don't forget us, Santa Claus.</i>

44
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:38,541
<i>Seventy-six degrees,
and the mercury is rising.</i>

45
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,041
<i>Speaking of Mercury,
make sure to look at the sky tonight</i>

46
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,666
<i>for a once-in-a-lifetime
planetary alignment.</i>

47
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,666
<i>And of course, keep listening to 99.3 KMCG
to catch the Christmas spirit.</i>

48
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,833
Okay. Really good ideas, team.
But don't do anything without me.

49
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:53,625
I'll get after it when I get in.

50
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:54,916
CC!

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,208
Oh my goodness.

52
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,416
Do you think it's good for you
to live like this?

53
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,416
Mom, I'm trying to get ready for my game.

54
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,916
I don't need a clean-room lecture.

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,791
It all ties together.
A disorganized room means a...

56
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,875
A disorganized mind. Yes, I know.

57
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:09,375
It affects everything,
including your soccer.

58
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:10,875
More importantly, your grades.

59
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,833
If I hope to play for the national team,

60
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,583
I need to focus on practice,
not cleaning my room.

61
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:16,666
Heads up.

62
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,083
You're not supposed to use your hands.

63
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,208
In the kitchen, 12 minutes.

64
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,125
Hey, Bill?

65
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:28,250
<i>♪ You shoot for the stars ♪</i>

66
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,583
<i>♪ If it feels right
And in for my heart... ♪</i>

67
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,708
- Bill. You okay?
- Yes. Yes.

68
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,458
I'm hanging out. You know how much
the baby loves the Camaro.

69
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:38,041
- Oh, the baby.
- Where's Mommy?

70
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,083
You driving it to work now that it's done?

71
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,541
- Show it off?
- You kidding me?

72
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:44,041
You put this much time into a car,
you don't drive it.

73
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:48,666
I mean, you barely even touch it.
You just bask in its power and beauty.

74
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,916
When you're done basking,

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,750
can you make sure Wyatt is up and dressed
and in the kitchen ready for the meeting?

76
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,458
Spock, your work was impeccable as always.

77
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:02,833
But I figured out why that lens
you fabricated isn't refracting properly.

78
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:04,916
You forgot to square the C.

79
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,208
<i>Your work is exquisite.</i>

80
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:11,708
No, my 1999 PSA-graded 10
holo Charizard is exquisite.

81
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,708
<i>I am envious of that card indeed.</i>

82
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:16,416
Wyatt, family meeting downstairs.
Let's go!

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,875
Who's this? Are these your smart friends?

84
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:20,666
The algebros?

85
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,750
Guys, I gotta go. Spock, tell Elon
he owes me another one.

86
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:30,208
So I was just thinking,
maybe after school today, we can hang out.

87
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,041
I can teach you how to drive.

88
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,541
Gasoline engines are an abuse of science.

89
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:37,750
And you know this.
I'm too scared to drive.

90
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,916
I'm also in the middle
of a lot of prep for my Yale interview.

91
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,416
I really can't slack off.

92
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,166
Totally get it. Totally get it.

93
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,625
Can you, uh,
can you help me with this problem?

94
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,000
- I'm kidding. You can't help me.
- No, I can't.

95
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,958
Okay, I'm calling this meeting to order.

96
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,375
We have a major few days ahead of us.

97
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:57,500
- CC, do I have your attention?
- Yeah, I'm looking for my homework.

98
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,583
Looking for it
like a completed assignment,

99
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,416
or like school starts in 20 minutes,
and you need to get started?

100
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,875
That'll be option B, Mom.

101
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:06,375
When do you find out
if you got into college early?

102
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,250
I would really love to help you pack.

103
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:11,958
I detect sarcasm, which is universally
regarded as the lowest form of humor.

104
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:15,458
Let's, uh, move this along. You know
if we talk too much, he just clenches up.

105
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:18,500
Right. Tomorrow is a big, big day
for the Walkers.

106
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,250
We have Wyatt's Yale interview,

107
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:24,208
CC's championship soccer game.
I have my huge presentation at work...

108
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,708
Don't forget about the Planetarium
today after school.

109
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,833
I was getting to that.
We're going to Wyatt's thing.

110
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,333
I have band practice.

111
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,958
Dad or Alive is playing
at the school holiday party.

112
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,750
This could be my second chance.

113
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:37,166
I really don't wanna go
to Wyatt's boring thing.

114
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,958
It's a quintuple planetary alignment.

115
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,541
It's a galactic confluence
of the highest order of magnitude.

116
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,416
It's my interstellar white whale.

117
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,458
Okay, seriously, who's his real father?

118
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:48,333
Look, you guys might not care
about Christmas, but I do.

119
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:51,375
So we are all going
to the Planetarium this afternoon.

120
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,833
I have a cute holiday sweater.
I want a picture.

121
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,541
We are gonna make a happy memory
as a family.

122
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,208
Can this meeting be adjourned?

123
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:00,666
Meeting adjourned.

124
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,916
- Ava!
- CC!

125
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:14,250
Go, CC! Go, CC! Go, CC!

126
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:17,875
Yo, hold on.

127
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:18,875
Yo.

128
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:22,000
- Yo, put your hands on the moneymaker.
- Hey, I got it!

129
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,500
- I'm a Spartan! Ah!
- Where the hell is he?

130
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,250
- I promise you...
- I am Hunter Drew!

131
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,041
I'm the Spartan!

132
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,833
Go, CC! Go, CC! Go, CC!

133
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:04,458
<i>♪ And I would do anything for love ♪</i>

134
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,333

00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:15,500
<i>♪ I would do anything for love... ♪</i>

136
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,416
Whoa. Walker.

137
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,083
You're standing in the hallway
and staring at Ariana?

138
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:24,500
Yo, Ariana!
Dude, this kid's starting to cream!

139
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:25,916
I'm sorry. I promise...

140
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,666
You just got obliterated, son!

141
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:35,583
You're a loser, Walker.

142
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,833
<i>One, two, three.</i>

143
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,250
Okay. Okay.

144
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:03,375
Uh, you... Uh, cut, cut for a second.

145
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:07,041
Um, there's tension.
Do you feel the tension in this room?

146
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,916
We gotta be loose.
Toss your music. Toss your sheet music.

147
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,125
Get rid of it.
Emma, why are you raising your hand?

148
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,666
Embrace the anarchy. Just call it out.
What do you got?

149
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,833
How do we play the song
without sheet music?

150
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:20,041
How did Luke Skywalker blow up
the Death Star without his computer?

151
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,333
I don't know what that means.
I was born in 2008.

152
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,541
Okay. Um...

153
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:25,458
Baxter?

154
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,166
- He used the Force.
- Yes!

155
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,333
What's the Force?

156
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:32,666
The Force is this enigmatic energy

157
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,291
that's inside all of us, and it's good.

158
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,875
Guys, you're in a band.
You're not individual players.

159
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,750
You guys are a thing. You're one thing.

160
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:44,375
So get out of your heads
and get into everyone's heart.

161
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:47,250
You, walk a mile in her shoes.
Walk a mile in his shoes.

162
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:51,208
Everybody, just try to feel
what it means to be a collective.

163
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:55,666
Now, come on. Let's give Jack White
the honor he deserves.

164
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,583
Go.

165
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,416
Drums, please.

166
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,250
Yeah.

167
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,750
Melody, strings.

168
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,791
Woodwinds. Bring it up. Let's go.

169
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,083
Who's feeling it?

170
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,333
Oh, boy.

171
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:16,375
Cymbals, get ready. Cymbals.

172
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,333
Did you feel that?

173
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,625
What... That...

174
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,500
Something's going on.
I gotta take just a second.

175
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,875
McCracken, you're in charge.
Uh, run through "Jingle Bells."

176
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:41,958
I'll be right back.

177
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Guys, what's up with the emergency
Dad or Alive meeting?

178
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,916
Do not tell me, Lake, that you sprained
your whammy wrist again.

179
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,833
No, we heard from a little TV show
called <i>So You Think You Can Rock?</i>

180
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:58,250
- What?
- We got the audition! Yeah!

181
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,833
Guys, do not mess with me.
I'm super fragile right now.

182
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:03,666
There's a TV crew coming here
to the school dance on Friday

183
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,916
for a live broadcast.

184
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,083
Dad or Alive is about to be famous!

185
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,208
What? This is insane!

186
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,916
- It's incredible. Come on!
- Yes!

187
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,142
<i>♪ You're packed and you're stacked
'Specially in the back ♪</i>

188
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,625
<i>♪ Brother, wanna thank your mother
For a butt like that ♪</i>

189
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:24,500
<i>♪ Or a shotgun, bang
What's up with that thang ♪</i>

190
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,791
<i>♪ I wanna know, how does it hang?</i>

191
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:30,101
<i>"Straight up, wait up, hold up, Mr. Lover

192
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:34,000
You'll have to work harder to stump me
on iconic ladies of the '90s, Gus, Gus.

193
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:34,916
You're so good.

194
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,375
- All your faves.
- Thanks.

195
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,708
Would they be holiday cookies
without M&M's?

196
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,625
Please. Give me some credit.

197
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,458
- Ah. There she is. Good morning, Kara.
- Good morning.

198
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:47,208
Triple-shot juggernaut.
Remixed just the way you like it.

199
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,666
- Oat milk?
- Oh, yeah.

200
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,250
- Thank you.
- We learned.

201
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:54,500
Do you believe this, boss?
My son's snake bit me.

202
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,958
That's what I get
for trusting the pet store.

203
00:10:57,041 --> 00:11:00,666
They told me it was harmless.
Turns out to be a water moccasin.

204
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,500
I'm so afraid
it's gonna ruin the pitch.

205
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:06,333
No, not at all.
I mean, you can barely even see it.

206
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,250
No one will notice.

207
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,875
- Oh, thanks.
- Merry Christmas.

208
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,416
Is that who I think it is?

209
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,791
- Are you ready for the pitch?
- I am now, Glen.

210
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:29,416
- These are for you. Your favorites.
- Thank you so much.

211
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,041
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

212
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,750
So The Molson Group called
to confirm tomorrow's pitch,

213
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,625
and Mr. Hanes wants to set a meeting
with you and the partners,

214
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:39,708
his words, "after we close this deal."

215
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,916
You're about to become
the first female partner

216
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,250
in the history of this firm.

217
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,875
- If I close Molson.
- Oh, you will.

218
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,583
Well, not if Steve snakes it out
from under me.

219
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,000
- Hey, Steve.
- Jess.

220
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:53,375
Wow, I love your haircut.
It, it kinda makes your nose look smaller.

221
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,458
Did you review the pitch document
I sent you?

222
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:58,625
Oh, yes, yes, I did. And I gotta say,
I love reviewing your work.

223
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,833
It just makes me feel more intelligent.

224
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:02,541
Any notes?

225
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:04,625
No.

226
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:08,208
Let's knock 'em dead
in there tomorrow. All right?

227
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:09,666
- Yes.
- You two thoroughbreds?

228
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,958
And, by the way, you close the deal,
somebody's making partner.

229
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:14,375
Partner.

230
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:16,375
Good luck.

231
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:19,958
Oh, you wish.

232
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,541
Just know, your team is here to help.

233
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:25,291
Oh, you guys are the best.
I think I've got it under control.

234
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,541
I know, I know.
You like to do everything yourself.

235
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:28,708
Yeah.

236
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:32,041
You're so sweet, but ultimately,
it is my responsibility.

237
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,541
- Aye, aye, captain.
- Yeah.

238
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:38,333
There we go, CC. Take it down the field.

239
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:40,791
Oh my God.

240
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:46,625
Literally the best soccer player
I have ever seen.

241
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:47,708
No offense.

242
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:56,583
Yes!

243
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,208
Hey, Walker.

244
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:02,041
The War of 1812 called.
It wants its cannon back.

245
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,166
- Thanks, Coach.
- That is a foot!

246
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,000
Do I have a surprise for you.

247
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:11,500
A scout for the national team
is comin' to the game tomorrow.

248
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,208
Are you serious?

249
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:15,666
Your mom won't be happy,
'cause you'd have to leave home,

250
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,791
but this is an opportunity of a lifetime.

251
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:22,583
You play a flawless game and we win,
you got nothin' to worry about.

252
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,583
So do that.

253
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,458
Don't do what I did when I had my shot

254
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:29,291
and thought about
everything that could go wrong.

255
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,333
Could mean the difference
between, uh, international athletic glory

256
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:36,125
and coaching high school soccer
and teaching science.

257
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,208
Thank you. I appreciate that.

258
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,333
So just be yourself tomorrow.

259
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:42,291
- All right?
- Okay.

260
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,916
- And everything will be fine.
- Everything will be fine.

261
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,583
All right. I'm proud of you. You got this.

262
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,791
National team? C, this is freakin' huge.

263
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,458
Ava, it's time to go.

264
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,041
Mommy's late for her
microdermabrasion appointment.

265
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,833
Okay, Mom. What do you think
your mom will say about this?

266
00:13:58,916 --> 00:13:59,916
She'll say, um...

267
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:04,041
"I am Jess Walker.
Definitely a human and not a robot."

268
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:07,125
"It is mathematically more favorable
to give up on your dreams

269
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:10,208
in favor of a boring life
identical to mine."

270
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,958
CC-Bear. Hi, honey.
It's time to hit the road.

271
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,583
The planets wait for no one.

272
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,500
Well...

273
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:25,791
Hello. I am Angelica,
and I have come to town.

274
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:29,541
I have just what you need for Christmas.

275
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:30,500
CC, please.

276
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:34,458
Get a reading
during the planetary alignment.

277
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,750
It will be magic.

278
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,583
Ah. This family looks like it could use
a little Christmas magic.

279
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,750
She says this to every family.
We should go.

280
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,809
- Thank you so much.
- Stressed out mama.

281
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:47,416
- I bet you work too hard.
- How does she know that, Mom?

282
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,291
Because if she said Dad worked too hard,
it would be sexist.

283
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,708
It's not magic.
It's performative liberalism.

284
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,375
We are on borrowed time with this baby.
We need to go.

285
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,916
- We're just here for the alignment thing.
- Okay.

286
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,041
Just remember to open your hearts

287
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,708
and view things
through the lens of one another.

288
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:07,250
- Yeah.
- That'll give you the very thing you need.

289
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,125
- Okay, thanks.
- Bye.

290
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:11,666
Come on.

291
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:23,208
Oh, we're gonna grab a snack.
See you in the telescope room.

292
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,875
Wyatt, why are you trippin'?

293
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,250
- Wow.
- Come on, let me buy you ice cream.

294
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:36,500
Buy me some ice cream?
Well, you know I struggle with dairy.

295
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,833
- That's because you hold it in, Mom.
- Well...

296
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,833
You just gotta let it rip.
Everybody farts.

297
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:43,458
- I don't.
- Why would you torture yourself?

298
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:46,833
Just eat some ice cream
and live in your body.

299
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:47,916
Yeah.

300
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,041
Hey, why are you being so nice to me?

301
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:56,000
Can't a daughter buy her mother
some ice cream without raising suspicion?

302
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,250
Not really, no.

303
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:08,750
There's a scout from the national team
coming to the game tomorrow,

304
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:12,666
and Coach thinks I have
a pretty good shot of making it.

305
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,458
Wow. Congratulations.

306
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:22,000
But if I made it,
I would have to leave home next year.

307
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:25,791
What about college?

308
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:30,250
CC, I know how much soccer means to you.

309
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,750
- Do you?
- Trust me, I know.

310
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:34,041
I wasn't much older than you.
I was Junior Olympics.

311
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,666
I know, Mom. And I'm really sorry

312
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,291
you had to give up your career
'cause you hurt your shoulder,

313
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,750
but this is completely different.

314
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,750
It's not.
I had to start completely from scratch.

315
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,750
I'm just trying to protect you from that.

316
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:48,750
- If you just applied yourself...
- I hate when you say apply myself.

317
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,250
Mom, we are different people.

318
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:53,500
You literally just want me to be you.
It's suffocating.

319
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,083
CC.

320
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:57,958
Big Yale interview tomorrow.
You nervous?

321
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,291
Very, very nervous.

322
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,791
I'm afraid it might trigger
my glossophobia.

323
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:04,625
Oh, buddy, I didn't know
you were scared of shiny things.

324
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,958
It's the fear of public speaking, Dad.

325
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,750
Right. Right.

326
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:12,000
Well... Um, hey, you know what?

327
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:15,500
Just pretend like
it's our family holiday Christmas video.

328
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:18,833
When you're with the family, you don't get
so afraid. You used to crush those.

329
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:22,291
There's a fearless performer in there.
I know it. Right?

330
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,125
But it does beg the question...

331
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,541
You sure you're ready for college?

332
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:33,625
Right? I mean, you're just a freshman.
You still got a lot of living to do.

333
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:36,750
All I know is I would do anything
to be in your shoes right now.

334
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:38,958
Maybe it's why you chose a career

335
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,333
that brings you back
to the source of your fond memories.

336
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,041
Whoa.

337
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,416
Excuse me.

338
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,583
Well, this was fun.

339
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,166
Mom thinks I have an easy life,

340
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,458
but she has no idea
what it's like to be me.

341
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:55,875
Yeah, I can relate.

342
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,833
Dad expects me to have the same jocular,

343
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:00,000
devil-may-care
high school experience that he did,

344
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,083
but the problem is I'm not him.

345
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:07,041
What did we do so wrong as parents
that our two teenagers wanna leave home?

346
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,250
Bill, this could be
our last Christmas together.

347
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,208
The alignment's about to start. Come on.

348
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,291
Next group, please.

349
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,250
Whoa.

350
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:20,750
Take Pickles.

351
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:23,458
Watch your step.

352
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,541
- Exit to the left.
- Okay.

353
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:28,166
This sucks.
I really didn't wanna come to this today.

354
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,333
This is actually not about you.

355
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:33,416
- This is about the family.
- My white whale. It's incredible.

356
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,166
Wyatt, I really would appreciate...

357
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,208
...don't care, but it means a lot
to your brother, and we're a family.

358
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:39,958
It's never what we wanna do...

359
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:42,541
Not a care in the world.
You get up, have a little Gatorade...

360
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:43,875
I wish you could be me.

361
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:47,416
I'd love for you to be me for one day.
You wouldn't make it through lunch.

362
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,333
You don't know how much effort I put in.

363
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:50,750
I gotta think about my job.

364
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,375
I would love for you
to know what it's like to be me.

365
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,416
- Believe it or not, I was young once.
- Like 10,000 years ago?

366
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,625
Honestly, I wanna be you.

367
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:00,541
I'd kill to eat a dozen doughnuts
and have it burn right off.

368
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,958
What I wanna do is take a picture.
I wanna take a picture.

369
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,226
- Yeah, okay.
- Great, picture.

370
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,250
Okay.

371
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,375
- What?
- Would you take a picture of my family?

372
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,083
Oh, it would be my pleasure.

373
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,625
- CC, deliver this with a smile...
- Better not post this.

374
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:16,333
- ...to the nice lady.
- I'd rather drink my own vomit.

375
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,875
Thank you. So you just follow what I ask.

376
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,541
Go up like that. Don't be naughty. Up. Up.

377
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:24,791
You go to the right.
You go to the left. Good. Good.

378
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,791
Okay, Papa, suck it in.
Your tummy is, you know, it's...

379
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,791
- Put the doggy in front of it.
- Okay.

380
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:34,958
All right,
everybody say, "Merry Christmas."

381
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,250
Merry Christmas.

382
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:57,708
Mom!

383
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,125
Miles!

384
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,541
Watch out!

385
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,125
That was crazy.

386
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,916
- Walkers, everybody okay?
- Did we just break the telescope?

387
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,333
Mom, are you kidding me?

388
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,536
- You okay, CC?
- This is so embarrassing.

389
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:26,458
- Everybody, is everyone okay?
- Mom, this is so embarrassing.

390
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:27,916
Let's get out of here.

391
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:55,541
Wyatt.

392
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:58,708
Pickles.

393
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:02,833
Pickles, be qu...

394
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:19,041
- How'd you get past my security system?
- What?

395
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,333
- What are you doing in my bed?
- You're in my bed.

396
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:23,833
Wait.

397
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:27,041
- Why am I in your bed, Dad?
- Why am I in your bed, Mom?

398
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,625
- Why are you calling me Mom?
- Why'd you call me Dad?

399
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,375
- Because you're Mom.
- You're Dad.

400
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:37,291
- Stop calling me Dad. I'm not Dad.
- Stop calling me Mom. I'm not Mom.

401
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:39,291
No, I'm not Mom!

402
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,250
What is all that yelling?

403
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,750
Bill? Bill, will you please tell...

404
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:56,208
CC, I told you to clean up the balls.

405
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,125
Either the multiverse is real,

406
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,750
and we have passed through
a sub-branching membrane

407
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:18,958
of an Einstein-Rosen bridge
into a parallel reality...

408
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:21,583
- You don't sound like Dad, Dad.
- ...or we've fallen asleep.

409
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:24,708
And this is just a dream,
and we have to wake up.

410
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:25,958
Slap me.

411
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:29,583
- Sure.
- Father Christmas!

412
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:31,041
- Whoa.
- Very sorry, Dad.

413
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,625
- What is happening?
- That's me.

414
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:37,458
CC?

415
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:39,416
Mom?

416
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:43,375
- What?
<i>- Mi familia.</i>

417
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,291
What a night. I know I'm getting old
when I drink one glass of vino

418
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:49,125
and I wake up in Wy-Guy's beddy-bye.

419
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:53,166
Something's not right.

420
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:02,625
CC?

421
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,250
Mom?

422
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:06,833
Wyatt?

423
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:08,541
Dad?

424
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:16,000
- CC, any luck?
- No.

425
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:18,333
This is a completely unique
and original situation

426
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:20,166
that has literally never happened before.

427
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,625
Right? I mean,
no kid has ever just woken up big.

428
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:26,166
- Yeah, it's so freaky.
- You're telling me. I'm 17 again.

429
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,333
I'm 13 going on 30.

430
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:29,583
We can agree
that we can't go out like this.

431
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:32,666
So I say we just go upstairs,
listen to Nirvana, and chill. All right?

432
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,125
Oh no,
I have my Molson pitch this morning.

433
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:38,625
If I'm not there,
I can kiss my partnership goodbye.

434
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,625
Oh, my Yale interview.

435
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:44,375
Oh, and I have Dad or Alive practice.
I can't miss that.

436
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:46,291
You are not playing my game.

437
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:48,333
And I am not playing like this.

438
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:50,416
Well... Oh my God.

439
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:56,416
Hey, remember when the planets lined up?

440
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,875
There was a crazy flash.
That's gotta be it. Right?

441
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:00,958
And then when we were looking at it...

442
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:03,458
You said, "You have no idea
how hard my life is."

443
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:05,916
"I'd love to be you."

444
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:08,791
And then you said...

445
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:10,750
"You'll never know
what it's like to be me."

446
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:13,541
We've gotta get to the telescope
so we can switch back.

447
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:15,041
Uh, what's wrong with Pickles?

448
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:22,416
What's going on with Miles?

449
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:27,041
Miles is Pickles.

450
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:28,750
Pickles is Miles.

451
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:30,166
Go!

452
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,250
Pickles!

453
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:33,708
Oh, Pickles.

454
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:38,166
Miles!

455
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,583
Go. Go.

456
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,500
I think I just peed.

457
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:05,250
One of the many joys of childbirth.
Thank yourself for that.

458
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:07,666
Wow, I feel like Spider-Man!

459
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:12,375
- Where's Wyatt?
- Cramps! Cramps!

460
00:25:15,708 --> 00:25:18,541
I think I tore a quadi.
I tore both quadis.

461
00:25:24,541 --> 00:25:26,708
Pickles! Come back!

462
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:28,541
Miles!

463
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:29,625
Pickles, no!

464
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,458
Whoa!

465
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:35,291
Oh my God.
Thank you, Rolf. Thank you so much.

466
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:38,583
Oh, you are such a considerate neighbor.

467
00:25:38,666 --> 00:25:40,916
Thank you for saving my baby...
I mean, my dog.

468
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,541
Give me this. Give me my child. Give...

469
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:46,208
No.

470
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:47,916
- Let go.
- Okay.

471
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,333
Oh my goodness. Thank you.

472
00:25:49,416 --> 00:25:51,000
Perhaps a leash and a bath?

473
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:52,541
Oh, my third-born child.

474
00:25:52,625 --> 00:25:55,125
- What would I do...
- He's a special dog.

475
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:57,458
- Just...
- Are you in there?

476
00:25:58,416 --> 00:26:02,041
If it would ever please you,
I would love to train your dog.

477
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:06,000
The dog needs the alpha energy, which, um...

478
00:26:08,291 --> 00:26:09,791
Bill does not possess.

479
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:11,583
- What?
- Discipline.

480
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:14,791
Chaos.

481
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:17,458
- Okay. Thank you, Rolf. Noted.
- Right.

482
00:26:18,083 --> 00:26:19,000
- Thank you.
- Good day.

483
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:22,666
Have a wonderful day, Walkers.
And a leash and a bath.

484
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,750
Oh, I literally have no pores.

485
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:28,333
Ow, Mom.

486
00:26:29,291 --> 00:26:31,041
It hurts to be you.

487
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:33,583
Whoa. Mom, check out your biscuit.

488
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:36,416
Who knew you were such a big booty Judy?

489
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,416
CC...

490
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:41,833
CC Walker, you have a tattoo!

491
00:26:42,375 --> 00:26:44,625
At least
it's a cute little owl, right?

492
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,666
But this, we gotta cover that up.

493
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:58,333
All over the face. Don't miss a spot.
Just like that.

494
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,125
Okay.

495
00:27:00,208 --> 00:27:02,625
- Is that...
- Yeah, Wyatt, It's fine.

496
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:04,291
- You're perfect.
- Why am I so itchy?

497
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:06,333
I'm like... All over my bod... What is...

498
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:11,833
Oh, Dad, your nipples are so hairy!

499
00:27:11,916 --> 00:27:13,541
Oh, stop. What are you...

500
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:16,166
No high school girl's
ever gonna date this.

501
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:18,250
Barf.

502
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:22,666
- Oh, absolutely not, CC.
- No. No.

503
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,750
You cannot wear that to school.
I will die.

504
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:27,333
- You think you're wearing that?
- You look like a doll.

505
00:27:27,416 --> 00:27:30,291
- Are those your father's gym shorts? No.
- Is this Nancy Pelosi?

506
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:32,541
- You have paint on your jacket.
- You're an artist.

507
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:34,666
- You should be able to dress like one.
- No.

508
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,666
I can't hope to be made partner
looking like a teenybopper.

509
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,041
You gotta bow down to the patriarchy,
don't you?

510
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:43,416
- Just dress for the male gaze.
- Oh, you and your ideals.

511
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,708
Let me tell you something.
Ideals don't pay the bills.

512
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:48,583
- Did you pluck my eyebrows?
- No.

513
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:51,041
Yes.

514
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:53,583
Look, I think we can both agree

515
00:27:53,666 --> 00:27:55,625
we don't wanna ruin
each other's lives today.

516
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:56,958
Good luck with that, Mom.

517
00:27:57,041 --> 00:27:59,458
When you get home,
you can change into whatever this is,

518
00:27:59,541 --> 00:28:00,833
but please, not for my pitch.

519
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:02,125
You cannot wear this.

520
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,708
- All right, deal.
- Okay? Deal.

521
00:28:04,791 --> 00:28:07,291
But can you un-Martha Stewart
the zing zang because...

522
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:08,375
Don't give me that.

523
00:28:08,416 --> 00:28:09,833
All right, Walkers,

524
00:28:09,916 --> 00:28:12,875
let's get to the telescope
and wish this back to normal.

525
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:17,750
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna drive.

526
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:20,250
No, you will not.
You look like you're six.

527
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:22,500
What are we gonna do?

528
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:28,166
Uh, what?

529
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:33,291

00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:35,333

536
00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:50,666
Whoa. Whoa. I'm sorry,
but the exhibit's closed.

537
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,583
Some clumsy family came in
and knocked over the telescope.

538
00:28:53,666 --> 00:28:55,000
And you know they was white.

539
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:56,843
Black people
don't create problems like this.

540
00:28:56,916 --> 00:28:58,916
You can fix all this, right?

541
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,708
Can we fix it? Doesn't it say
maintenance on my shirt?

542
00:29:01,791 --> 00:29:03,041
Okay. How long will it take?

543
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,458
Well, about four or five hours of work.

544
00:29:05,541 --> 00:29:06,916
- Okay.
- Yes. Okay.

545
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,833
I'd say a week. Week and a half.

546
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:14,208
- Does that...
- Guys, I got it. All right? Don't worry.

547
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:18,291
Sir, if you could have this
up and running for me by tonight,

548
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:19,916
I'll make it worth your while.

549
00:29:20,583 --> 00:29:22,750
How much cheddar we talking about,
lil' player?

550
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:28,541
- One second. You guys got any cheddar?
- I don't have any cheese.

551
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:29,875
- No.
- Cheese?

552
00:29:29,958 --> 00:29:31,166
No, it's slang, honey.

553
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,500
Do you take Zelle?

554
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,416
- Zelle?
- Do I take...

555
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,750
- Hell yeah, I take Zelle.
- Yeah? Oh, great.

556
00:29:37,833 --> 00:29:41,458
We'll have it up and running tonight.
We will not rest until it's done.

557
00:29:41,541 --> 00:29:42,625
Let's get some lunch.

558
00:29:43,958 --> 00:29:45,666
- Amazing.
- Okay.

559
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,583
Thanks for your help, Rolf.

560
00:29:47,666 --> 00:29:50,041
This family just has a really
challenging day ahead.

561
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:51,333
Nothing to worry about.

562
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:54,208
Your puppy and your baby
are in very capable hands.

563
00:29:55,708 --> 00:29:58,416
Rolf, have you ever been
around a baby before?

564
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,083
Yes, of course I have.
I was a baby myself once.

565
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,708
Okay, off you go, boys.

566
00:30:12,541 --> 00:30:16,625
As you can see, I have already placed
the baby down for a nap.

567
00:30:16,708 --> 00:30:18,125
Auf Wiedersehen. <i>Tschüssi.</i>

568
00:30:26,208 --> 00:30:27,208
Okay.

569
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:36,375
God, this skirt is so tight and itchy.
I don't know how you wear it.

570
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:38,916
It's like I'm shrink-wrapped
in fiberglass.

571
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,541
- I'm allergic.
- Stop touching it. Look at me. Focus.

572
00:30:41,625 --> 00:30:42,791
We've got this.

573
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:45,166
You look like me.
You sound like me. You act...

574
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:49,500
Oh, CC, what did you eat?

575
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:52,208
Sorry. I pounded a Gatorade
on the way over here.

576
00:30:53,791 --> 00:30:55,083
Just, just put the shoes on.

577
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,791
Follow my lead.

578
00:30:57,875 --> 00:30:58,916
- You good?
- Yeah.

579
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:02,208
Okay, this is Gus.
Please say hello to him.

580
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:03,125

Thank you.

589
00:31:26,791 --> 00:31:27,791
Where's your car?

590
00:31:30,875 --> 00:31:32,708
Okay, we can do this. Just keep...

591
00:31:40,541 --> 00:31:41,666
Honey. Come here.

592
00:31:43,208 --> 00:31:44,666
- Just shake it off.
- I got it.

593
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:48,125
- You're fine. Just shake it off.
- I'm fine.

594
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:51,500
- Oh my God, CC! What are you doing here?
- Hi.

595
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:55,541
Is this a new game? Like...

596
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:57,625
This is my assistant, Kara.
Give her the bag.

597
00:31:57,708 --> 00:31:58,958
Sorry about that, Karrie.

598
00:31:59,041 --> 00:32:00,208
- Kara.
- Kara.

599
00:32:00,291 --> 00:32:02,041
Sorry. I'm just out of it. I...

600
00:32:02,583 --> 00:32:04,875
I hit the hard stuff
a little too hard last night.

601
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:07,000
Yeah, girl, congratulations.
Girl, finally.

602
00:32:08,708 --> 00:32:10,750
- It's awful, isn't it?
- Yes.

603
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:12,833
No. I just...

604
00:32:12,916 --> 00:32:14,333
- I gotta squeeze it.
- What...

605
00:32:14,416 --> 00:32:15,583
Just get in there and...

606
00:32:16,833 --> 00:32:18,416
- Oh no!
- No.

607
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,041
That is how things scar.

608
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:21,750
Is that who I think it is?

609
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:27,625
I'm sorry.

610
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:31,750
I'm sorry. You can't do that.
You can't do that or you'll get kicked.

611
00:32:31,833 --> 00:32:33,250
- I...
- Oh, Jess.

612
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:36,125
Jess. Big day, Jess. Everybody's waiting.

613
00:32:36,208 --> 00:32:37,750
Don't let us down.

614
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:41,583
Yes, I'll be... She'll be right there.

615
00:32:41,666 --> 00:32:42,666
I like it.

616
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:45,750
- Who's this creature?
- Oh, I'm her daughter, CC.

617
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:48,958
Oh, I can see the resemblance.
You got a big nose too.

618
00:32:50,291 --> 00:32:52,166
- Oh, I never...
- Did you see his nose?

619
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:55,000
We just need one second to prepare.

620
00:32:55,083 --> 00:32:56,750
Can't believe I thought we could do it.

621
00:32:56,833 --> 00:33:00,166
- What happened to "Miss I Got This"?
- She fell down the steps, Mom.

622
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:02,458
Oh, just give me a second.

623
00:33:02,541 --> 00:33:04,416
I'm so nervous. I need chocolate.

624
00:33:05,208 --> 00:33:07,958
- Chocolate. I need chocolate.
- Note cards.

625
00:33:08,041 --> 00:33:10,125
Okay, note cards. Okay.

626
00:33:12,541 --> 00:33:13,541
Oh.

627
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:20,125
Oh, yeah.

628
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,458
So good.

629
00:33:31,541 --> 00:33:33,166
Cold. It's cold. It's cold.

630
00:33:34,583 --> 00:33:36,625
Okay, CC, look at me.

631
00:33:36,708 --> 00:33:39,166
I wrote the entire presentation
on note cards.

632
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,916
All you have to do is read them.

633
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,791
I don't know anything about architecture.

634
00:33:42,875 --> 00:33:45,666
We're Walkers, and Walkers never quit.

635
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:48,583
Not true. We always turn a movie off
before it's over.

636
00:33:48,666 --> 00:33:54,250
All you have to do is W-A-L-K
into that meeting and read them.

637
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,791
- Be a boss.
- Be a boss.

638
00:33:57,875 --> 00:33:59,416
- Be a boss.
- Be a boss.

639
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,041
- Be a boss.
- Be a boss.

640
00:34:01,125 --> 00:34:02,875
- Be a boss.
- Be a boss. Let's go!

641
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:07,625
Whoa. Whoa.
Dad, you can't just walk out there.

642
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:10,833
Keep your head down.
Make eye contact with no one.

643
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:12,041
What?

644
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:14,125
- You're about to run the gauntlet.
- What's that?

645
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:16,500
It's very critical
that you don't stay in one place

646
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:18,791
for less than four seconds
or more than seven.

647
00:34:18,875 --> 00:34:20,958
Hey. What's up?
Yo, Ruggles, what's up, man?

648
00:34:21,041 --> 00:34:24,333
Heck of a game last Friday.
Seriously. You looked like Aaron Donald.

649
00:34:24,416 --> 00:34:26,750
- Thanks, bud. I froze my ass off though.
- I got you.

650
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:28,083
Oh, dude, I bet.

651
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,250
- Get here.
- What?

652
00:34:33,916 --> 00:34:35,833
- What are you doing?
- I got some news here.

653
00:34:35,916 --> 00:34:38,291
Your dad happens to be the toast,
and high school's my jam.

654
00:34:38,375 --> 00:34:41,708
Food metaphors have no place here, Dad.
This is life and death.

655
00:34:41,791 --> 00:34:42,791
- I'm...
- I got it.

656
00:34:43,416 --> 00:34:44,833
What's up, ladies? How are we?

657
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,458
Hey!

658
00:34:59,416 --> 00:35:00,666
Three. Three balls!

659
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:03,833
All right.

660
00:35:07,541 --> 00:35:08,416
No.

661
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,708
We don't eat garbage. That's not healthy.

662
00:35:11,291 --> 00:35:14,625
No. Hey. Stop it.
That's the water for the doggy.

663
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:18,416
No doggy water. No. <i>Nein.</i>

664
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,333
I'll give you your privacy.

665
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:38,041
If, if you want me to take over,
I can take over.

666
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:40,208
Oh, there she is.

667
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:42,416
Right not on time.

668
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,166
Yeah. All right.

669
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:48,208
Peter, I'd like to thank you
and everyone at The Molson Group

670
00:35:48,291 --> 00:35:49,958
for taking time to come in today.

671
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:51,833
- Start.
- Love that.

672
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:56,583
Our, our, our project leader
and all-around superstar, Jess Walker,

673
00:35:56,666 --> 00:35:58,583
is gonna lead us through the presentation.

674
00:35:58,666 --> 00:36:00,583
Jess? Jess, we're ready.

675
00:36:01,666 --> 00:36:02,666
- Jess.
- Go, Jess.

676
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:03,791
You're gonna like it.

677
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,416
Uh...

678
00:36:13,625 --> 00:36:15,375
Thank you for being here today.

679
00:36:15,458 --> 00:36:17,125
- Yes.
- I'm gonna get started.

680
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:21,166
First, I'd like to thank you
for coming today.

681
00:36:21,833 --> 00:36:24,083
Second, I'd like to talk about this firm

682
00:36:24,166 --> 00:36:27,833
because here at this firm,
we wanna exceed expectations.

683
00:36:28,583 --> 00:36:33,750
We want to combine beauty
and function and innovation.

684
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:39,791
Here at this firm, we have no experience
building... We have experience...

685
00:36:39,875 --> 00:36:41,583
- Is she okay?
- She's fine.

686
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:43,708
Here at this firm, at Atlas...
Here at Atlas...

687
00:36:43,791 --> 00:36:45,083
The cards.

688
00:36:45,166 --> 00:36:46,875
Cards.

689
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:51,041
- I know, but my eyes don't work.
- Glasses.

690
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,958
Okay. Um...

691
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:56,750
Okay.

692
00:36:56,833 --> 00:36:58,250
I got it.

693
00:36:58,333 --> 00:37:01,083
- I got it.
- Hang on. Don't panic.

694
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,958
Hang on. Okay, not to worry.

695
00:37:04,041 --> 00:37:06,541
You know what, Jess?
Why don't I just jump in right here?

696
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:07,666
No!

697
00:37:08,416 --> 00:37:09,416
I'm sorry?

698
00:37:10,291 --> 00:37:11,791
Really? Uh...

699
00:37:12,791 --> 00:37:14,958
- Sorry. Continue.
- What's going on?

700
00:37:15,041 --> 00:37:17,208
I'm gonna talk about the building itself.

701
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:20,541
- That's what matters.
- Yeah.

702
00:37:20,625 --> 00:37:22,025
- That's what we're here for.
- Yup.

703
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:24,083
There's a roof and there are walls.

704
00:37:27,125 --> 00:37:28,583
There's a church.

705
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:30,791
Here is the steeple.

706
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,083
Open the door,

707
00:37:33,708 --> 00:37:34,875
see all the people.

708
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:50,375
Know what?

709
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:53,250
You lucky 'cause I like to laugh
as much as the next person.

710
00:37:54,458 --> 00:37:56,375
- You do?
- No, not really.

711
00:37:57,916 --> 00:38:00,333
- You know what? We're done. Thank you.
- Peter.

712
00:38:00,416 --> 00:38:02,208
- Tell him to pull the car around.
- No. No.

713
00:38:02,291 --> 00:38:05,083
Wait. Wait. I think what my mom
is trying to say

714
00:38:05,166 --> 00:38:07,458
is that we blend form and function

715
00:38:07,541 --> 00:38:09,833
while using the south buttress
as a tiered garden,

716
00:38:09,916 --> 00:38:12,291
while also supporting the central arcade.

717
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:15,708
- Hm. Who's this intelligent young woman?
- Oh, I'm her daughter.

718
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:20,416
And any intelligence I have is purely
because of the way my mother raised me.

719
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,708
- Open that up. Let me see.
- What is going on with you?

720
00:38:23,791 --> 00:38:26,500
I think the ice cream
in the break room was expired.

721
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:28,041
- I...
- Ice cream in the break room?

722
00:38:28,125 --> 00:38:30,625
I'm lactose intolerant.
That means you're lactose intolerant.

723
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:33,166
It's so bad.
I don't think I can hold it in.

724
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,875
Oh, yes you can. You wanna know why?

725
00:38:34,958 --> 00:38:36,958
There are 40 years of farts
in that stomach.

726
00:38:37,041 --> 00:38:39,833
You won't let them out
on the most important day of my career.

727
00:38:39,916 --> 00:38:41,916
- I don't wanna let them out.
- Just breathe.

728
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,267
- Jess, are you all right?
- I won't let them out.

729
00:38:44,291 --> 00:38:49,291
Jess, why don't you just continue to tell
Mr. Molson about the presentation?

730
00:38:50,791 --> 00:38:51,791
Yeah.

731
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:53,791
I've got it. Sorry.

732
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:55,583
I need to...

733
00:38:58,375 --> 00:38:59,375
I've got it.

734
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:08,083
I have to live in my body! I'm sorry!

735
00:39:09,666 --> 00:39:11,041
Oh my God.

736
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:16,666
She's really sorry.

737
00:39:17,791 --> 00:39:20,875
I cannot believe my entire future
just blew up right in front of me.

738
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:23,375
That was in the past.
We have to focus on the present.

739
00:39:23,458 --> 00:39:25,125
You have to play soccer for me.

740
00:39:25,208 --> 00:39:27,333
The account. My partnership.

741
00:39:27,416 --> 00:39:30,750
Why didn't you ask some of those people
for help? Don't they work for you?

742
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:34,000
Yes, CC, technically. But, ultimately,
it is my responsibility to...

743
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:35,500
Okay, whatever. Listen up.

744
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:37,291
Stand on the side, run around,

745
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:41,000
but if anyone passes you the ball,
for the love of God, pass it right back.

746
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:42,958
CC, I think I can handle that.

747
00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:46,250
And, Mom, whatever you do,
try not to be weird with my friends.

748
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:48,750
Believe it or not,
I was pretty cool in high school.

749
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:50,333
I'm gonna go with "or not."

750
00:39:54,833 --> 00:39:58,250
Hey! You got this, CC.

751
00:39:58,333 --> 00:40:01,750
- Kick some butt today.
- Butt will be kicked.

752
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:04,208
- Good luck today, CC.
- Thank you.

753
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:13,750
Go, CC! Go, CC! Go, CC!

754
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:18,083
Everything okay, C?
You seem a little stressed.

755
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:21,500
Yeah. No, I'm fine.
I just don't really like the roughhousing.

756
00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:23,791
Right. By the way,
how are you liking the tattoo?

757
00:40:23,875 --> 00:40:25,625
- I'm getting mine this weekend.
- Do not.

758
00:40:25,708 --> 00:40:28,541
It was a completely irresponsible
and irrational decision,

759
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:30,333
and I regretted it immediately.

760
00:40:30,416 --> 00:40:32,833
Did your mom see it? I bet she freaked.

761
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,375
No. As a good mother should,

762
00:40:35,458 --> 00:40:37,875
she holds space
for all her children's mistakes.

763
00:40:37,958 --> 00:40:40,416
That's hilarious.
You sound just like her.

764
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,208
"I am Jess Walker,
mother of the century,

765
00:40:43,291 --> 00:40:46,625
and I hold space
for all of my children's mistakes."

766
00:40:47,291 --> 00:40:50,000
Come on, bus is leaving.
It's game time, girl.

767
00:40:54,083 --> 00:40:56,166
- Yes?
<i>- Hey, Rolf, it's CC.</i>

768
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:57,250
<i>How's it going?</i>

769
00:40:57,291 --> 00:40:59,791
Uh, it's a tremendous challenge,
but I'll fix it.

770
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:01,625
Have no fear. Rolf is here.

771
00:41:01,708 --> 00:41:04,625
<i>What do you mean a tremendous challenge?
It's a child and a dog.</i>

772
00:41:04,708 --> 00:41:05,791
<i>Make sure they're safe.</i>

773
00:41:05,875 --> 00:41:08,375
I will apply myself that much more firmly.

774
00:41:08,458 --> 00:41:09,666
<i>You don't have to be firm.</i>

775
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:11,590
<i>Keep it together.
We'll be home after the game.</i>

776
00:41:11,666 --> 00:41:14,083
I must leave you now.
The training continues. Ciao.

777
00:41:14,166 --> 00:41:15,000
<i>Rolf. Rolf.</i>

778
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:21,583
<i>Welcome, everybody.
It's a beautiful day here at BMO Stadium.</i>

779
00:41:21,666 --> 00:41:24,541
The Lucy Jones Unicorns
are going up against their archrivals,

780
00:41:24,625 --> 00:41:28,416
the Broadwick Daredevils
for the Southern California Championship.

781
00:41:28,958 --> 00:41:30,041
Come on, Unicorns.

782
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:33,000
The Unicorns are led
by their captain, CC Walker.

783
00:41:33,083 --> 00:41:36,541
She was All-American her freshman year
and has received accolades ever since.

784
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:38,250
Let's not forget about the Daredevils.

785
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:41,583
They got their own secret weapons,
Gisele and Alyssa Thompson,

786
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:42,833
the Switchblade Sisters.

787
00:41:42,916 --> 00:41:43,916
But I didn't say it.

788
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,875
Oh, this is torture.
Come on, Mom. Don't let me down.

789
00:41:49,416 --> 00:41:53,416
I think I see Alex Sullivan.
That's a scout for the US national team.

790
00:41:55,666 --> 00:41:56,666
Hey, girl.

791
00:41:57,208 --> 00:41:59,708
Oh my gosh. I'm gonna get it together.

792
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:02,916
Hey, Mrs. Jenk... Hey, Carrie. Hi, Carrie.

793
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,333
Oh my God, I love this backwards cap vibe.

794
00:42:05,416 --> 00:42:07,208
Very festive. Very game day.

795
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:09,791
Just a little stressed today, actually.

796
00:42:09,875 --> 00:42:13,125
Well, guess what?
Brought us a little game day vino.

797
00:42:13,208 --> 00:42:15,375
- Wine?
- Yeah.

798
00:42:15,458 --> 00:42:18,000
No. I'm focused on the game,
but thank you.

799
00:42:18,083 --> 00:42:21,500
Oh. Right, I forgot. She's a super mom.
She focuses on the game.

800
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:24,791
She knows all the players' names.
I don't know anyone's name.

801
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,833
Okay.

802
00:42:29,916 --> 00:42:31,958
Ah. You're so not prepared for this, Dad.

803
00:42:32,041 --> 00:42:35,291
What? I'm fine, okay? I went to college.
I can do a college interview.

804
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:38,125
You went to Arizona State University.
This is Yale.

805
00:42:38,208 --> 00:42:41,458
Well, some would say that Arizona State
is the Yale of Southwest Tempe.

806
00:42:41,541 --> 00:42:42,541
N...

807
00:42:43,416 --> 00:42:44,625
- Wyatt.
- Yeah?

808
00:42:45,416 --> 00:42:47,666
I'm sorry. He... He's Wyatt.

809
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:50,583
I'm a man.
I'm an adult man with an adult body,

810
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:52,000
adult body hair.

811
00:42:52,083 --> 00:42:53,083
I'm just like you.

812
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:55,541
Actually, I'm Scandinavian.
I'm surprisingly hairless.

813
00:42:55,625 --> 00:42:57,375
Is your name Wyatt?

814
00:42:57,458 --> 00:43:00,250
No. 'Cause I'm a man,
and Wyatt is a child.

815
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:01,416
This is Wyatt.

816
00:43:02,083 --> 00:43:04,416
Okay, then. We're ready for you.

817
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,125
Okay, I'll be right in.
Thank you so much. I appreciate it.

818
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:10,708
My God, man, get a grip.
What are we doing?

819
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:12,791
All right? Relax, okay?

820
00:43:12,875 --> 00:43:15,416
Hey, when we play <i>Jeopardy,</i>
who always wins?

821
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,708
- Me.
- Okay, yeah, well, besides you?

822
00:43:17,791 --> 00:43:19,833
- Mom.
- Okay, well, I beat CC, don't I?

823
00:43:19,916 --> 00:43:23,083
- She never even watches with us.
- Okay, when we watch <i>Is It Cake?</i>

824
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:25,125
I'm always the first to guess
if it's cake.

825
00:43:25,208 --> 00:43:29,125
- You are freakishly good at that.
- Thank you. Now wish me luck, okay?

826
00:43:29,208 --> 00:43:32,166
Ninety minutes. Ninety minutes.
Ninety minutes.

827
00:43:35,041 --> 00:43:36,416
And away we go.

828
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,291
Come on, Unicorns! Come on, Unis!

829
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:40,833
And her first touch is...

830
00:43:42,833 --> 00:43:45,250
...literally touching the ball
with her hands.

831
00:43:45,958 --> 00:43:47,041
She caught the ball.

832
00:43:50,375 --> 00:43:52,875
- She caught it.
- Oh God, are you gonna be okay?

833
00:43:53,666 --> 00:43:56,000
He saw her catch it. What is she doing?

834
00:43:56,833 --> 00:43:58,625
She's hitting today.

835
00:43:58,708 --> 00:44:02,083
The trick is you watch it on a tablet,

836
00:44:02,166 --> 00:44:05,541
and then you can screengrab an image
and zoom in on it.

837
00:44:06,291 --> 00:44:07,916
Once you see those brush marks,

838
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,500
that's how you know it's cake.

839
00:44:14,958 --> 00:44:16,791
- Don't snap back.
- Yeah, we don't snap.

840
00:44:20,375 --> 00:44:22,375
Is this, is this <i>Flashdance?</i>

841
00:44:23,166 --> 00:44:26,291
Wyatt, just as a courtesy,
if you wanna start this over...

842
00:44:26,375 --> 00:44:27,375
Oh, please, no.

843
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:30,750
- No? You wanna hit save on...
- Yeah.

844
00:44:32,541 --> 00:44:34,541
The body language is all wrong.

845
00:44:34,625 --> 00:44:37,041
That is not enjoyment. That is judgment.

846
00:44:37,125 --> 00:44:38,583
Hey, Mr. Walker.

847
00:44:38,666 --> 00:44:40,000
Then Dave Grohl joined the band<i>,</i>

848
00:44:40,083 --> 00:44:42,791
and they recorded <i>Nevermind</i>
in the spring of 1991.

849
00:44:42,875 --> 00:44:43,791
Ariana.

850
00:44:43,875 --> 00:44:45,291
- Is that Wyatt in there?
- Yes.

851
00:44:46,666 --> 00:44:48,875
Yeah. Wyatt's in there. He's not out here.

852
00:44:48,958 --> 00:44:51,333
You know, I'm happy for him about Yale.
It's just...

853
00:44:51,791 --> 00:44:53,541
I don't know. It's sad to see him go.

854
00:44:54,333 --> 00:44:55,791
- Yeah? You'd be sad?
- Of course.

855
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:58,833
I mean, we've lived a block
away from each other since I was born.

856
00:44:58,916 --> 00:45:01,500
You know, we always
used to play together as kids.

857
00:45:01,583 --> 00:45:03,333
We even had this
Christmas teddy bear thing

858
00:45:03,416 --> 00:45:05,333
we used to pass around each year.

859
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:07,625
- You remember that?
- Of course I do.

860
00:45:07,708 --> 00:45:11,083
He's such a kind and thoughtful guy,
and honestly, there's so few of them.

861
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:12,916
He's really tough. He does karate.

862
00:45:13,666 --> 00:45:15,791
Yeah. He's got two stripes
on his white belt.

863
00:45:15,875 --> 00:45:18,475
Should be a yellow belt.
His sensei said he cried during his test,

864
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:21,541
which is insane
'cause he almost never cries in real life.

865
00:45:22,125 --> 00:45:23,885
- Get it to CC!
- Oh my gosh.

866
00:45:23,958 --> 00:45:28,208
Girl. Okay, remember I told you that
John and I were having a little issue?

867
00:45:28,291 --> 00:45:30,958
I tried that crazy thing
you told me about from college.

868
00:45:31,041 --> 00:45:32,666
It worked. I went...

869
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:55,375
Walker gets sliced and diced
by the Switchblade Sisters!

870
00:45:55,458 --> 00:45:58,375
It's a red card! Cut her from behind.
You saw that, right?

871
00:45:58,458 --> 00:46:00,125
- You saw that?
- Yeah.

872
00:46:00,208 --> 00:46:03,291
Can't imagine the national scout
is pleased with this performance.

873
00:46:03,375 --> 00:46:05,500
- Pass me some of that wine?
- Absolutely.

874
00:46:05,583 --> 00:46:06,750
Oh.

875
00:46:06,833 --> 00:46:08,291
We would be remiss

876
00:46:08,375 --> 00:46:11,333
if we didn't talk about
the very exciting work

877
00:46:11,416 --> 00:46:14,500
that you appear to be doing
with the Riemann hypothesis.

878
00:46:15,375 --> 00:46:16,375
Solved it.

879
00:46:19,875 --> 00:46:24,833
- One of Hilbert's 23 unsolved problems?
- Yeah, tell Hillbilly he's down to 22.

880
00:46:25,416 --> 00:46:28,625
Okay, Hillbilly has been dead
for 80 years.

881
00:46:28,708 --> 00:46:33,333
As someone who has wrestled with Riemann,
I'm curious, which way are you leaning?

882
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,166
True or false?

883
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
False.

884
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,958
- Ira.
- Suck a duck.

885
00:46:40,041 --> 00:46:41,041
Take a breath.

886
00:46:41,125 --> 00:46:44,666
The Clay Institute offers a $1 million
prize to anyone who can solve Riemann.

887
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:48,041
We would love if you could show
some of your work here right now.

888
00:46:48,125 --> 00:46:49,041
Thrilled.

889
00:46:50,625 --> 00:46:52,500
Um...

890
00:46:52,583 --> 00:46:53,583
Ree-man?

891
00:46:55,958 --> 00:47:00,541
I thought you said Redman.
I solved his hypothesis.

892
00:47:00,625 --> 00:47:03,833
- The Redman hypothesis?
- Redman hypothesis?

893
00:47:03,916 --> 00:47:05,208
From Wu-Tang?

894
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:10,708
Come on.

895
00:47:10,791 --> 00:47:12,125
CC Walker sleeping

896
00:47:12,208 --> 00:47:14,125
as that ball rolled
right between her legs.

897
00:47:17,166 --> 00:47:19,246
The Daredevils with a one-zero lead.

898
00:47:19,291 --> 00:47:22,375
Oh, this is torture.
You are ruining my life!

899
00:47:23,041 --> 00:47:26,083
When parents yell from the sidelines,
it puts pressure on the kids.

900
00:47:26,166 --> 00:47:28,750
She popped out three kids,
and she works 60 hours a week.

901
00:47:28,833 --> 00:47:31,666
I think she can handle
a little bit of constructive criticism!

902
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:33,916
I gotta get outta here.
I gotta get outta here.

903
00:47:35,291 --> 00:47:36,708
That's my girl.

904
00:47:37,958 --> 00:47:38,833
CC, I'm coming.

905
00:47:38,916 --> 00:47:41,583
- Looks like we have a helicopter mom.
- Excuse me!

906
00:47:43,875 --> 00:47:45,416
Black Hawk down.

907
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,416
Is that a <i>Minecraft</i> sticker
on your bottle?

908
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,041
- Yeah, I love <i>Minecraft.</i>
- You do?

909
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:50,541
- Yeah.
- What about <i>Dune?</i>

910
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,958
Wanna talk about the original
or the new one?

911
00:47:53,041 --> 00:47:56,541
- I actually wanna talk about the novel.
- Frank Herbert is my favorite author.

912
00:47:56,625 --> 00:47:58,500
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

913
00:47:59,583 --> 00:48:02,666
Any chance you're a vegetarian
who's open to cloned meats?

914
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:03,791
Obviously.

915
00:48:03,875 --> 00:48:07,916
Obviously. Right?
It's the only ethical, sensible way to be.

916
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,916
- How do you feel about cyborgs?
- Robots kinda freak me out.

917
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,750
- Sure, totally. Robots are stupid.
- No.

918
00:48:12,833 --> 00:48:15,416
Hey, you think Wyatt
might wanna go to Hunter's party?

919
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,458
- Hunter Drew is having a party?
- Mm-hmm.

920
00:48:18,541 --> 00:48:20,416
Maybe I'll be able to hang out with him.

921
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,916
I think he might be there.

922
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,916
All right, cool. See you, Mr. Walker.

923
00:48:25,625 --> 00:48:26,666
Bye.

924
00:48:28,541 --> 00:48:31,916
Don't, don't stand up on the chair. What?

925
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,291
- Push up.
- Push up. Mrs. Walker.

926
00:48:34,375 --> 00:48:35,375
Sorry.

927
00:48:36,125 --> 00:48:37,166
Hustle!

928
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:38,916
- Pass and move.
- Pass and move. Come on!

929
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,541
Seriously, I got this.

930
00:48:40,625 --> 00:48:42,000
- Jeez.
- Sorry.

931
00:48:42,583 --> 00:48:44,458
Watch out for that sweeper!

932
00:48:44,541 --> 00:48:46,375
Take the shot!

933
00:48:46,458 --> 00:48:48,166
- Goal!
- Goal!

934
00:48:50,958 --> 00:48:54,250
Okay, Mrs. Walker,
I appreciate the enthusiasm,

935
00:48:54,333 --> 00:48:56,083
but parents are not allowed down here.

936
00:48:56,166 --> 00:48:57,333
Ever since that lawsuit.

937
00:48:57,416 --> 00:48:58,791
- You know this.
- Sorry.

938
00:49:00,333 --> 00:49:02,625
Come on, let's huddle up.
Come on. Bring it in.

939
00:49:02,708 --> 00:49:05,166
All right. You guys can't hear this.
Get away. Get away.

940
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:07,166
You're giving me everything. I want more.

941
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:09,166
Put pressure. We gotta play our game...

942
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:12,666
Excuse me. I think we gotta switch
from a 4-4-2 to a 4-3-3.

943
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:14,500
You need the extra attacker out there

944
00:49:14,583 --> 00:49:16,583
if we're gonna generate
any scoring opportunities.

945
00:49:16,666 --> 00:49:19,083
- Let me have that board.
- That's mine. That's my board.

946
00:49:19,166 --> 00:49:22,375
When you get that outer pass from Ava,
I want the attackers upfield.

947
00:49:22,458 --> 00:49:24,958
They're gonna overcompensate,
and that'll be wide open.

948
00:49:25,041 --> 00:49:26,961
This is what we've waited for
since kindergarten.

949
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
What?

950
00:49:28,458 --> 00:49:29,916
- Team on three.
- Team on three.

951
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,291
- One, two, three, team.
- Team!

952
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:35,666
They've switched from a 4-4-2 to a 4-3-3.

953
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:37,291
Someone give CC the ball.

954
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:39,458
- She's ready. She's open.
- Pass it.

955
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,125
There's a lob passed to CC Walker.
She's wide open.

956
00:49:43,208 --> 00:49:45,291
- She's got it!
- Come on! Let's go!

957
00:49:45,375 --> 00:49:46,583
- Let's go!
- CC, get it!

958
00:49:46,666 --> 00:49:49,791
- A chance for the game-winning goal.
- You got it, CC! You got it!

959
00:49:58,041 --> 00:49:59,750
You can't just... Put it in, CC!

960
00:49:59,833 --> 00:50:02,416
Do it! Do it, Mama! Do it!
What are you doing, Mama!

961
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,083
What's she doing?

962
00:50:04,166 --> 00:50:05,416
- You okay?
- No.

963
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:06,416
What is she doing?

964
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,833
I believe she's helping
the opposing player.

965
00:50:08,916 --> 00:50:10,083
Here, I'll help you.

966
00:50:10,166 --> 00:50:13,250
You know, CC Walker's hopes
for the national team

967
00:50:13,333 --> 00:50:14,791
dashed right in front of us.

968
00:50:14,875 --> 00:50:17,166
Pretty sad day.
Tell you that much.

969
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,833
CC, I said I was sorry.

970
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,916
Well, you always said
soccer doesn't make a real career.

971
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,625
Thanks to you, it never will be.

972
00:50:32,708 --> 00:50:35,875
Honey, there will be other chances
at the national team.

973
00:50:35,958 --> 00:50:37,375
You don't get it

974
00:50:37,458 --> 00:50:42,541
because you don't really care about me
and about what actually makes me happy.

975
00:50:42,625 --> 00:50:46,791
You just want me to be like you
and think like you and act like you.

976
00:50:48,125 --> 00:50:49,750
It's not about the national team.

977
00:50:51,416 --> 00:50:53,041
I just wanna get away from you.

978
00:51:03,166 --> 00:51:04,750
<i>Nein. Aus.</i>

979
00:51:05,833 --> 00:51:07,083
<i>Aus.</i> Stuck.

980
00:51:07,166 --> 00:51:08,791
Drop it.

981
00:51:16,208 --> 00:51:17,291
What?

982
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:19,875
What, wha... What do you want?

983
00:51:19,958 --> 00:51:21,875
You want me to put this diaper on you?

984
00:51:22,916 --> 00:51:25,583
If you understand me, bark twice.

985
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:27,750
Wow.

986
00:51:27,833 --> 00:51:30,333
Super. You're fine.

987
00:51:39,291 --> 00:51:41,041
He asked me to do this.

988
00:51:45,583 --> 00:51:49,041
Listen, I think the dog and the baby
are spending too much time together.

989
00:51:50,083 --> 00:51:53,125
All right, time to put this day
behind us and switch back.

990
00:51:53,833 --> 00:51:55,000
Oh, it looks great.

991
00:51:55,083 --> 00:51:57,166
Fire it up.
Let's get this show on the road.

992
00:51:58,125 --> 00:52:00,666
Unfortunately,
the old girl still ain't up and running.

993
00:52:01,458 --> 00:52:02,333
Excuse me?

994
00:52:02,416 --> 00:52:05,833
We put the telescope back together,
but we can't find the fifth lens.

995
00:52:06,375 --> 00:52:08,541
It's no bigger than a quarter.
Damnedest thing.

996
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:12,000
- We looked everywhere for it. It's gone.
- Let's get a new one.

997
00:52:12,083 --> 00:52:14,958
Dad, it's an achromatic field lens
with a double convex eye.

998
00:52:15,041 --> 00:52:16,666
The lens is comprised of thorium oxide.

999
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:19,184
Which has a similar crystalline structure
to calcium fluoride.

1000
00:52:19,208 --> 00:52:21,291
With optical properties
of high refractivity.

1001
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:22,291
And low dispersion...

1002
00:52:22,375 --> 00:52:24,458
To minimize chromatic aberration.

1003
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:26,750
Is that something we can get
at LensCrafters or...

1004
00:52:26,833 --> 00:52:28,916
Hell no, you can't pick it up
at LensCrafters.

1005
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,208
- They're handmade in Switzerland.
- Lausanne, to be exact.

1006
00:52:33,125 --> 00:52:35,458
And the alignment
only lasts for one more day.

1007
00:52:35,541 --> 00:52:37,708
You'll catch the next one.

1008
00:52:38,333 --> 00:52:39,375
Very funny.

1009
00:52:39,958 --> 00:52:41,083
Why is that funny?

1010
00:52:41,708 --> 00:52:44,625
Because the next alignment is in 2162.

1011
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:54,000
Hey, my favorite family.
Has everybody found the Christmas spirit?

1012
00:52:54,083 --> 00:52:55,083
Definitely not.

1013
00:52:55,125 --> 00:52:57,916
Well, maybe some Christmas caroling
will help bring it out.

1014
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,916
- It always helps me.
- No. We're in a crisis. Are you serious?

1015
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,458
It sounds like you need to fix
what is broken.

1016
00:53:04,541 --> 00:53:06,291
Yeah, we have to fix the telescope,

1017
00:53:06,375 --> 00:53:09,041
but we have to find
a very specialized, specific lens...

1018
00:53:09,125 --> 00:53:10,833
Spock!

1019
00:53:10,916 --> 00:53:12,875
It, it's a long shot, but he owes me,

1020
00:53:12,958 --> 00:53:15,833
and SpaceX probably has the tech
to fabricate the lens we need.

1021
00:53:15,916 --> 00:53:16,958
- Right.
- Yes.

1022
00:53:17,041 --> 00:53:18,041
I'll call that Lyft.

1023
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,375
- Guess what?
- You're a Lyft driver too?

1024
00:53:23,458 --> 00:53:24,500
Come on. Let's go.

1025
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,041
<i>♪ You better watch out
You better not cry ♪</i>

1026
00:53:29,125 --> 00:53:33,166
<i>♪ Better not pout
I'm telling you why ♪</i>

1027
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:35,208
<i>♪ Santa Claus is... ♪</i>

1028
00:53:35,291 --> 00:53:37,531
All right, Walkers,
let's try and get some sleep.

1029
00:53:37,583 --> 00:53:39,791
Wyatt, what's wrong? What's going on?

1030
00:53:41,166 --> 00:53:46,625
I was talking to Ariana earlier, and, um,
she invited me, well, you,

1031
00:53:47,541 --> 00:53:50,083
to a party at Hunter Drew's house,

1032
00:53:50,791 --> 00:53:56,125
and I just was really hoping
to have my body back so I could...

1033
00:53:57,208 --> 00:53:58,666
I don't like parties.

1034
00:54:04,625 --> 00:54:05,791
- No.
- Yes.

1035
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:07,833
- No.
- Yes. Come on.

1036
00:54:09,625 --> 00:54:10,625
For Wyatt.

1037
00:54:11,166 --> 00:54:13,833
Why is everything blurry up close?

1038
00:54:14,833 --> 00:54:16,250
I don't... Ugh.

1039
00:54:17,291 --> 00:54:19,458
What is it, like midnight? I'm exhausted.

1040
00:54:20,833 --> 00:54:22,416
It's, like, 7:45.

1041
00:54:23,833 --> 00:54:25,583
This is kind of exciting, right?

1042
00:54:25,666 --> 00:54:29,000
Is it bad to say that this is the most
exciting thing I've done in years?

1043
00:54:30,083 --> 00:54:31,083
Jimmy, jump!

1044
00:54:33,916 --> 00:54:34,916
Jimmy!

1045
00:54:35,541 --> 00:54:37,125
Should we call his mother?

1046
00:54:37,625 --> 00:54:39,000
I'm sure Jimmy's fine.

1047
00:54:39,083 --> 00:54:41,083
- Party on.
- I don't think Jimmy's moving.

1048
00:54:50,541 --> 00:54:51,541
What are you doing?

1049
00:54:52,041 --> 00:54:54,833
Well, I realized
I have Mom's fingerprints and her face,

1050
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:58,375
so I can use her one-touch
to take the team to Coachella.

1051
00:54:58,458 --> 00:55:00,958
$12,000. Buy now.

1052
00:55:01,041 --> 00:55:02,041
Whoa. Okay.

1053
00:55:02,958 --> 00:55:04,583
Let's see what Dad's got going on.

1054
00:55:04,666 --> 00:55:05,875
- Let's see.
- I'm in.

1055
00:55:06,541 --> 00:55:09,500
- Uh. Oh, that's a colonoscopy.
- Oh.

1056
00:55:09,583 --> 00:55:11,291
- Why are they so...
- Hey, girl!

1057
00:55:11,375 --> 00:55:13,416
Yeah!

1058
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:17,458
- Monthly moms' night in the house!
- Yes...

1059
00:55:17,541 --> 00:55:18,750
- Bill's here.
- Um...

1060
00:55:18,833 --> 00:55:20,916
- Her husband's here.
- I should go.

1061
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
- Stay here.
- You want Bill to stay?

1062
00:55:24,083 --> 00:55:26,166
- It's unprecedented.
- I guess Bill's staying.

1063
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:28,833
I'm starving.
You always outdo yourself every month.

1064
00:55:28,916 --> 00:55:31,041
We cannot wait to see
what you cooked for dinner.

1065
00:55:31,125 --> 00:55:32,416
Oh, what I cooked?

1066
00:55:32,958 --> 00:55:34,708
- Come on.
- Yeah, okay. Excuse me.

1067
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:37,000
Oh, God.

1068
00:55:37,958 --> 00:55:39,500
What is going on with you two?

1069
00:55:39,583 --> 00:55:42,125
I've been worried about you
ever since the soccer game.

1070
00:55:42,208 --> 00:55:45,333
- I know a cry for help when I see one.
- The neighborhood is talking.

1071
00:55:45,416 --> 00:55:46,958
- No.
- Yes.

1072
00:55:47,041 --> 00:55:48,750
- Let's get that wine going.
- Yeah.

1073
00:55:58,875 --> 00:56:00,416
- What?
- Ariana's coming.

1074
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:01,916
- What's your plan?
- What?

1075
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,291
I just don't want you
messing this up for Wyatt.

1076
00:56:04,375 --> 00:56:06,541
I got it. I'll be fine, all right?
Just relax.

1077
00:56:06,625 --> 00:56:07,625
Hey.

1078
00:56:10,416 --> 00:56:11,666
Jitters.

1079
00:56:13,666 --> 00:56:15,375
- Hi, Ariana.
- Hi, CC.

1080
00:56:15,958 --> 00:56:18,500
You okay? I heard you had a stroke
at your soccer game.

1081
00:56:19,083 --> 00:56:19,916
Oh...

1082
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,291
- You're fine?
- Really good.

1083
00:56:21,375 --> 00:56:23,833
You look like you got dressed
at a Goodwill. You're not fine.

1084
00:56:23,916 --> 00:56:25,291
Hi. Sorry to interrupt.

1085
00:56:25,416 --> 00:56:30,500
I need to speak with my wife/spouse person
right now in the kitchen.

1086
00:56:30,583 --> 00:56:31,958
- Gotta go.
- Wife person?

1087
00:56:32,041 --> 00:56:33,541
We've never been hotter.

1088
00:56:33,625 --> 00:56:36,125
You don't even know,
it's just "passion" passion.

1089
00:56:36,208 --> 00:56:37,083
Passion?

1090
00:56:37,166 --> 00:56:38,791
You know, my intimacy doula, Blaze,

1091
00:56:38,875 --> 00:56:41,625
says that couples need a minimum
of 12 kisses a day

1092
00:56:41,708 --> 00:56:43,625
just to sustain a relationship

1093
00:56:43,708 --> 00:56:46,333
Blaze has recently been working
with Harry and Meghan.

1094
00:56:46,458 --> 00:56:48,916
We've already kissed all day.
We've kissed like 14 times.

1095
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,333
- I don't think so.
- Yeah.

1096
00:56:50,416 --> 00:56:53,083
- Why don't you guys give a kiss?
- What is going on?

1097
00:56:53,166 --> 00:56:54,458
I think they're on to us.

1098
00:56:55,125 --> 00:56:56,041
- What?
- Yeah.

1099
00:56:56,125 --> 00:56:58,500
- No, I've been gone for two minutes.
- I know.

1100
00:56:58,583 --> 00:56:59,958
I think we have to kiss.

1101
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:02,333
Never doin' that.

1102
00:57:02,416 --> 00:57:04,458
- Please, little mouth-to-mouth CPR.
- Come on.

1103
00:57:04,541 --> 00:57:06,791
You have to kiss me. Just do it.
Wyatt. Wyatt!

1104
00:57:06,875 --> 00:57:09,958
- Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
- Save your marriage.

1105
00:57:10,041 --> 00:57:11,541
They're like a pack of wolves.

1106
00:57:11,625 --> 00:57:13,458
- You have to do it.
- I don't wanna do it.

1107
00:57:13,541 --> 00:57:15,583
- We don't have a choice.
- Ew.

1108
00:57:15,666 --> 00:57:16,791
I'm so sorry, Wyatt.

1109
00:57:16,875 --> 00:57:20,041
Just be a man. Just do it fast.
Just do it. Do it.

1110
00:57:20,125 --> 00:57:23,250
- Fight for your love.
- Less talking, more kissing.

1111
00:57:23,333 --> 00:57:25,208
- Come on.
- Let's see it.

1112
00:57:25,291 --> 00:57:26,458
It's healthy.

1113
00:57:26,541 --> 00:57:27,416
Do it.

1114
00:57:30,666 --> 00:57:31,916
No.

1115
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,625
- Oh gosh.
- He looks like an iguana.

1116
00:57:34,958 --> 00:57:36,416
- They're kissing.
- Oh my gosh.

1117
00:57:48,666 --> 00:57:50,916
We have to ta...
We have to talk in the kitchen.

1118
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,625
I wanna make out with him so bad.

1119
00:57:55,083 --> 00:57:57,541
- You want some?
- Oh no, please, no.

1120
00:57:57,625 --> 00:57:58,958
Especially not after six, no.

1121
00:57:59,041 --> 00:58:03,666
Between the colonoscopy and the polyps,
it's just a lot on my, on my heart.

1122
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:05,625
- I'm so sorry.
- We got bigger problems.

1123
00:58:05,708 --> 00:58:08,416
- Mom and Dad are gone.
- What'd you mean? They can't be gone.

1124
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,041
I don't know. They're gone.

1125
00:58:10,125 --> 00:58:11,208
What are we gonna do?

1126
00:58:11,291 --> 00:58:13,416
First thing is
to get rid of these crazy moms.

1127
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,625
They're here for Mom's
monthly supper club.

1128
00:58:15,708 --> 00:58:18,708
Okay, so if we give them food,
they'll leave.

1129
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:20,333
Yeah.

1130
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:24,083
We'll make 'em something. Mom does it.

1131
00:58:24,166 --> 00:58:26,583
I've observed Mom making dinner
thousands of times.

1132
00:58:26,666 --> 00:58:27,541
How hard can it be?

1133
00:58:27,625 --> 00:58:29,541
- I'll get the chicken.
- I'll get the fixings.

1134
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,500
Hey, girls.

1135
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,666
Are we doin' it for the 'gram?

1136
00:58:43,833 --> 00:58:45,041
Whoa! Oh my God!

1137
00:58:45,125 --> 00:58:47,125
- Wait a minute!
- I'm getting some water!

1138
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:49,291
What...

1139
00:58:51,458 --> 00:58:52,458
Turn this off!

1140
00:58:53,625 --> 00:58:55,791
- You know what? Gimme those.
- I knew it.

1141
00:58:55,875 --> 00:58:57,958
- Have some.
- I mean, I'm not driving, right?

1142
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:02,583
These are so good.

1143
00:59:02,666 --> 00:59:06,791
The cheese and the chemicals all comes
together and melts in your mouth and...

1144
00:59:06,875 --> 00:59:10,333
- You're really into those?
- Not sure when I'll have these again.

1145
00:59:10,416 --> 00:59:11,708
- Cheez-Its?
- Yeah.

1146
00:59:11,791 --> 00:59:14,208
Gotta seize the opportunity
when it presents itself.

1147
00:59:15,208 --> 00:59:16,333
Yeah.

1148
00:59:16,416 --> 00:59:19,458
- Oh, hey, mistletoe.
- Oh yeah. Look at that.

1149
00:59:20,333 --> 00:59:25,250
<i>♪ And I would do anything for love ♪</i>

1150
00:59:25,875 --> 00:59:29,125
<i>♪ I'd run right into hell and back... ♪</i>

1151
00:59:31,041 --> 00:59:33,458
Uh... I'm really sorry. I have to go.

1152
00:59:34,625 --> 00:59:35,625
Dude, do it!

1153
00:59:38,166 --> 00:59:40,166
- She just doesn't look well.
- She doesn't.

1154
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:43,083
- I think she should try this...
- There's a scent to her.

1155
00:59:43,166 --> 00:59:45,125
- She has not been showering.
- Oh wow.

1156
00:59:45,208 --> 00:59:47,625
- You made ants on a log.
- Yeah.

1157
00:59:47,708 --> 00:59:49,458
What's that little guy doing
in the popcorn?

1158
00:59:49,541 --> 00:59:51,833
- Thank you so much.
- That's elf on the shelf.

1159
00:59:51,916 --> 00:59:53,516
- Oh, that...
- Is this artisanal celery?

1160
00:59:54,583 --> 00:59:57,750
Maddy just uploaded a TikTok.
I manage her page.

1161
00:59:57,833 --> 01:00:02,708
She just got to Hunter Drew's party
and said that Wyatt is talking to Ariana.

1162
01:00:02,791 --> 01:00:05,333
Wait, who, who, who's doing what where?

1163
01:00:05,416 --> 01:00:08,083
Oh, and CC's just dancing alone
in a corner.

1164
01:00:09,166 --> 01:00:12,375
We have to go. Party's over! Call Rolf!

1165
01:00:12,458 --> 01:00:15,250
I think if we had a divorce in the group,
it'd be nice.

1166
01:00:22,416 --> 01:00:23,291
Yeah.

1167
01:00:23,375 --> 01:00:27,375
Hey, abort mission.
Abort mission, okay? She tried to kiss me.

1168
01:00:27,458 --> 01:00:29,041
That's a good thing, right?

1169
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:31,875
No, it's not. I'm 45. Do the math.

1170
01:00:31,958 --> 01:00:35,250
- You're right. That's a little bit weird.
- A little weird? It's disgusting.

1171
01:00:35,333 --> 01:00:37,833
Walker. What are you doing here, man?

1172
01:00:37,916 --> 01:00:41,083
I didn't invite you to this party,
science dork.

1173
01:00:41,625 --> 01:00:42,458
Let's just go.

1174
01:00:42,541 --> 01:00:46,000
Yeah. He's right, okay?
We'll leave, all right?

1175
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,708
Although, you know, I, I'm sorry, man.

1176
01:00:54,791 --> 01:00:56,875
I want you to know,
I'm not a science dork.

1177
01:00:56,958 --> 01:00:58,541
I'm more of a science nerd.

1178
01:00:58,625 --> 01:01:00,000
Whatever, geek.

1179
01:01:00,625 --> 01:01:03,208
You know, I'm such a nerd,
I looked at my dad's computer

1180
01:01:03,291 --> 01:01:07,291
and told him to delete all the cookies,
and he threw all the Oreos in the trash.

1181
01:01:08,333 --> 01:01:11,291
Yeah, 'cause your dad's the only person
who'll hang out with you.

1182
01:01:11,833 --> 01:01:14,125
My dad happens to think I'm pretty great.

1183
01:01:15,791 --> 01:01:19,750
You know, guys, I'm such a nerd
that the only dessert I eat is pie.

1184
01:01:19,833 --> 01:01:21,958
3.14. That's amazing.

1185
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:28,000
You'll get that one
when you take geometry again.

1186
01:01:30,666 --> 01:01:32,583
That's it, Walker. You're dead.

1187
01:01:42,583 --> 01:01:44,208
- What happened?
- That was amazing.

1188
01:01:44,291 --> 01:01:45,458
- Oh, it was?
- Yes.

1189
01:01:45,541 --> 01:01:47,833
I'm so happy we did this.
I'm having so much fun.

1190
01:01:47,916 --> 01:01:49,833
- Me too.
- Why don't we do this more often?

1191
01:01:49,916 --> 01:01:52,083
Crash high school parties
in our kids' bodies?

1192
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:54,333
No, I mean, go out together.

1193
01:01:54,958 --> 01:01:58,041
I don't know. Work, three kids, life.

1194
01:01:58,125 --> 01:02:00,125
When all this is over,
we're going out more.

1195
01:02:00,208 --> 01:02:03,250
Like we used to, all right?
I miss this. I miss you.

1196
01:02:03,333 --> 01:02:04,625
I miss you too.

1197
01:02:05,333 --> 01:02:06,791
Aren't they brother and sister?

1198
01:02:09,208 --> 01:02:10,250
This is your song.

1199
01:02:10,333 --> 01:02:11,333
Whoa.

1200
01:02:12,125 --> 01:02:14,041
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

1201
01:02:14,125 --> 01:02:15,500
Somethin's coming.

1202
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:17,791
Walker.

1203
01:02:19,041 --> 01:02:20,916
Gonna get over here and join me?

1204
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,333

Have you seen CC Walker? Is she here?

1210
01:02:40,833 --> 01:02:44,041
- This is a high school party.
- Stay focused. Get us in there.

1211
01:02:45,833 --> 01:02:47,375
Wyatt! What's up, buddy?

1212
01:02:47,458 --> 01:02:49,125
Dad, what are you doing?

1213
01:02:49,208 --> 01:02:50,458
You can't do this.

1214
01:02:50,583 --> 01:02:52,500
Just let loose a little bit, bud. Come on.

1215
01:02:52,583 --> 01:02:54,166
- What are you doing?
- Hey, CC.

1216
01:02:55,375 --> 01:02:58,166
- This is absolutely unacceptable.
- I can explain.

1217
01:02:58,250 --> 01:02:59,500
You can explain?

1218
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:02,083
I'm having fun.
Can you not be happy for your mother?

1219
01:03:02,166 --> 01:03:03,541
Moms don't dance like this.

1220
01:03:04,875 --> 01:03:07,041
I'm having fun. You have fun in my body.

1221
01:03:07,125 --> 01:03:11,458
For the rest of the time
you are in this body, you're grounded.

1222
01:03:11,541 --> 01:03:12,708
You're grounded.

1223
01:03:12,791 --> 01:03:15,958
I don't dance. I play <i>Dungeons & Dragons.</i>

1224
01:03:16,041 --> 01:03:18,291
These are the moments.
These are what I'm talking about.

1225
01:03:19,125 --> 01:03:22,666
- Okay, pattern recognition kicking in.
- Don't fight the feeling.

1226
01:03:23,208 --> 01:03:24,916

- The cops are here!
- Go!

1237
01:04:08,541 --> 01:04:10,000
- Mr. Walker.
- Ariana.

1238
01:04:10,083 --> 01:04:12,333
I'm so embarrassed
about what happened with Wyatt.

1239
01:04:12,416 --> 01:04:15,416
- Wha... What happened?
- I don't know. Things got weird and...

1240
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:16,666
I'm so grounded!

1241
01:04:19,125 --> 01:04:22,125
- Don't you walk away from me.
- You're a total double standard.

1242
01:04:22,208 --> 01:04:24,500
I can't leave home
to do the one thing I love,

1243
01:04:24,583 --> 01:04:25,916
but you can do whatever you want.

1244
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,833
Look at you. You were right
about that outfit. You look fly.

1245
01:04:28,916 --> 01:04:33,666
But I am here, stuck in this hag body,
and you're just out

1246
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:37,375
while I have your stupid friends
and your psycho dog baby.

1247
01:04:37,458 --> 01:04:38,791
Is me having fun the problem?

1248
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,583
Because I thought the problem
was me being a robot.

1249
01:04:41,666 --> 01:04:45,041
"I am Jess Walker.
Your criticism does not compute."

1250
01:04:45,125 --> 01:04:47,333
Maybe we should be having more fun.

1251
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:50,208
We weren't there to have fun.
We were trying to help Wyatt.

1252
01:04:50,291 --> 01:04:51,666
Yeah, right. When we walked in,

1253
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:54,625
you were literally doing
the Electric Walker Slide.

1254
01:04:54,708 --> 01:04:57,958
Your mother and I had a small moment
for the first time in 20 years.

1255
01:04:58,041 --> 01:05:00,750
- So what?
- You also ruined things with Ariana, Dad.

1256
01:05:00,833 --> 01:05:02,666
Things are not that bad.
She tried to kiss me.

1257
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,916
- You stole my first kiss?
- No. I pulled away.

1258
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,166
- You rejected Ariana? On my behalf?
- God! Gosh!

1259
01:05:10,250 --> 01:05:11,500
- Dad.
- Now I'm confused.

1260
01:05:11,583 --> 01:05:14,458
- I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
- Let's go. Come on.

1261
01:05:14,541 --> 01:05:16,041
- We're not done with this.
- No.

1262
01:05:16,125 --> 01:05:17,725
- Oh, we're done.
- I can't win with you.

1263
01:05:17,791 --> 01:05:19,833
I can't believe you left
without permission.

1264
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:24,125
- You left the house without my permission.
- I don't need it. I'm an adult.

1265
01:05:24,208 --> 01:05:25,958
No wonder you're so confused.

1266
01:05:28,333 --> 01:05:29,375
Get out of my room.

1267
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:30,666
I'm not sleeping in here.

1268
01:05:31,791 --> 01:05:33,083
Gross.

1269
01:05:34,958 --> 01:05:37,250
Dad, what are you doing?
Get out of here.

1270
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:38,833
Don't even think about it.

1271
01:05:41,833 --> 01:05:42,833
Nope.

1272
01:05:45,166 --> 01:05:46,083

01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:06,708

1279
01:06:06,791 --> 01:06:09,416
He says he should have
the lens done by tonight.

1280
01:06:09,958 --> 01:06:11,250
We can last another day.

1281
01:06:11,333 --> 01:06:13,458
Thank goodness
we got a second chance with Molson.

1282
01:06:13,541 --> 01:06:15,833
Call in sick to school
and go straight to my office.

1283
01:06:15,916 --> 01:06:18,375
Mom, wait, no. I have a math final today.

1284
01:06:18,458 --> 01:06:21,833
It's 30% of my grade.
You have to get to school.

1285
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,041
Fine. Just try and stall them.
I'll get there as fast as I can.

1286
01:06:26,125 --> 01:06:30,541
Okay, but, Mom, if I am going to be you,
I gotta be me.

1287
01:06:30,625 --> 01:06:32,333
- What does that mean?
- It's...

1288
01:06:32,416 --> 01:06:33,791
- It's gonna be great.
- CC.

1289
01:06:33,875 --> 01:06:34,791

We're gonna present our design
for Jefferson Gardens,

1298
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:09,333
but this time,
we are going to do it as a team.

1299
01:07:09,416 --> 01:07:12,166
W-w-w-wait, so you don't want
to do it all by yourself?

1300
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:14,541
No. I need help, guys. I need you all.

1301
01:07:14,625 --> 01:07:17,125
Whatever you need,
your team is here to help. Right?

01:07:20,916 --> 01:07:24,583
- Ooh. Could I be Beyoncé?
- She doesn't remember our names.

1305
01:07:24,666 --> 01:07:27,833
- Snake bite, did you ever play sports?
- Field hockey in high school.

1306
01:07:27,958 --> 01:07:29,416
Team sport. My girl.

Okay, team, on three.

1310
01:07:39,125 --> 01:07:41,166
- Bring it in. Ready?
- Great, I love it.

1311
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:42,875
You guys are the best.

1312
01:07:42,958 --> 01:07:44,333

1313
01:07:44,416 --> 01:07:45,791

- Go!

1314
01:07:49,958 --> 01:07:51,041
Well, that's everyone.

1315
01:07:51,125 --> 01:07:53,250
I guess I can let you all go
a little early.

1316
01:07:53,333 --> 01:07:57,791
Unless someone is brave enough
to give the extra credit problem a try.

1317

CC.

1318
01:08:01,958 --> 01:08:03,541
The answer you're looking for is 42.

1319
01:08:04,916 --> 01:08:08,291
That's correct.
I wasn't expecting anyone to get that.

1320
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:10,666
Well, you're actually asking
the wrong question.

1321
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:11,625
- I am?
- CC.

1322
01:08:11,708 --> 01:08:14,250
- Please elaborate.
- With pleasure.

1323
01:08:14,333 --> 01:08:16,250
It's essentially an architectural problem.

1324
01:08:16,333 --> 01:08:19,916
We're solving for a curvature equation
using differential geometry.

1325
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:24,166
But what's the vector analysis?
Where are the planar quadrilaterals?

1326
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:27,375
And we must calculate
for the cross-structural integrals.

1327
01:08:27,458 --> 01:08:29,708
- You know, guys, math is art.
- Seriously?

1328
01:08:29,791 --> 01:08:34,833
Just look at the quadrature of Notre Dame,
or even the Golden Ratio of the Parthenon.

1329
01:08:34,916 --> 01:08:38,833
And even the Chaminar Monument in India
uses the number four in its intervals.

1330
01:08:38,916 --> 01:08:40,291
Right, guys? Come on.

1331
01:08:48,083 --> 01:08:51,541
Mr. Hollis, when do you think
we'll have those results?

1332
01:08:51,625 --> 01:08:53,041
I'm worried about my grades.

1333
01:08:53,125 --> 01:08:55,916
Miss Walker, I think we both know
where you stand.

1334
01:08:58,041 --> 01:09:01,125
- It's really that bad, then?
- What? No.

1335
01:09:01,208 --> 01:09:04,500
I mean, the progress that you've made
this semester, it's been amazing.

1336
01:09:05,166 --> 01:09:08,458
If your mom could see
how hard you've been applying yourself,

1337
01:09:08,541 --> 01:09:09,916
she'd be really proud.

1338
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,208
Thank you.

1339
01:09:15,291 --> 01:09:17,458
What do you mean
it's not gonna be done on time?

1340
01:09:17,541 --> 01:09:22,125
Spock, I need that lens tonight
before the planetary alignment ends.

1341
01:09:22,875 --> 01:09:25,041
There are astrological implications.

1342
01:09:25,125 --> 01:09:29,458
You're the frontman. Heard great things.
Ten million people watching tonight.

1343
01:09:29,541 --> 01:09:31,500
Pressure's on. You know what they say.

1344
01:09:31,583 --> 01:09:33,708
Burst pipes makes diamonds.

1345
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Gwyneth, no more candles.
Come on. Load up.

1346
01:09:40,583 --> 01:09:43,416
Come on, bro. It's time. Let's roll.

1347
01:09:44,625 --> 01:09:46,166
- Come on.
- Yeah.

1348
01:09:47,083 --> 01:09:50,375
You gonna be all right?
Ready to do this?

1349
01:09:51,291 --> 01:09:52,541
Oh.

1350
01:09:52,625 --> 01:09:53,916
- Kara?
- Hm-mm.

1351
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,458
You don't know this,
but my daughter, she's like a...

1352
01:09:59,416 --> 01:10:02,250
- She's a really good soccer player.
- Of course I know that.

1353
01:10:02,333 --> 01:10:06,166
You've shown everyone here, like,
no less than 1,000 videos of her playing.

1354
01:10:06,708 --> 01:10:07,833
- I have?
- Yes.

1355
01:10:08,375 --> 01:10:09,541
She's awesome.

1356
01:10:09,625 --> 01:10:13,958
So I'm being a total control freak
by killing a huge opportunity for her

1357
01:10:14,041 --> 01:10:16,833
to move away from home
and play with the national team.

1358
01:10:16,916 --> 01:10:18,083
Jess.

1359
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:20,583
You're not being a control freak.

1360
01:10:20,666 --> 01:10:23,166
You're just doing
what you think is best for CC.

1361
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:24,708
- Please.
- Jess.

1362
01:10:25,541 --> 01:10:28,250
You're my boss, and you're my role model,

1363
01:10:28,333 --> 01:10:31,500
and I'd be thrilled if I could manage
to balance work and family

1364
01:10:31,583 --> 01:10:33,083
even as half as well as you can.

1365
01:10:33,166 --> 01:10:35,208
But you've taught me
it comes with sacrifices.

1366
01:10:35,291 --> 01:10:36,416
What sacrifices?

1367
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:39,333
I mean, not like sacrifices
because they're for your kids,

1368
01:10:39,416 --> 01:10:41,041
and apparently, they're important.

1369
01:10:41,125 --> 01:10:44,083
I wouldn't know.
I have hamsters. But, like, sacrifices.

1370
01:10:44,833 --> 01:10:47,916
Like how you've told me, you haven't
taken a vacation in five years

1371
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,291
so that you could pay
for CC's soccer camps.

1372
01:10:51,208 --> 01:10:53,583
Or how you could've
had this promotion three years ago,

1373
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:55,375
but didn't want to miss her games.

1374
01:10:55,458 --> 01:10:57,875
It's what makes you the best mom I know.

1375
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:00,041
We're gonna go in and kick ass,

1376
01:11:00,125 --> 01:11:02,500
you, that beautiful tie,
and those yellow pants.

1377
01:11:02,583 --> 01:11:04,375
Girl, you can pull anything off.

1378
01:11:04,458 --> 01:11:05,333
CC.

1379
01:11:09,791 --> 01:11:10,875
I'm sorry, Mom.

1380
01:11:10,958 --> 01:11:14,166
- No, no, CC, stop.
- I didn't understand how hard your job is.

1381
01:11:14,833 --> 01:11:17,833
- And everything you do for our family.
- No, no, CC.

1382
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:20,125
I'm the one who's sorry.

1383
01:11:20,208 --> 01:11:22,791
You were right, honey.
Your way works for you,

1384
01:11:22,875 --> 01:11:25,416
and it doesn't have to be my way
to be a good way.

1385
01:11:26,708 --> 01:11:29,583
More than anything in this entire world,

1386
01:11:30,083 --> 01:11:32,000
I just want you to be okay.

1387
01:11:32,083 --> 01:11:33,541
I will be okay

1388
01:11:33,625 --> 01:11:37,125
'cause I have the best mom in the world,
and that's how she raised me.

1389
01:11:45,791 --> 01:11:47,208
- Mom...
- Hm.

1390
01:11:49,166 --> 01:11:53,125
We are gonna W-A-L-K
out of here and crush this pitch.

1391
01:11:53,708 --> 01:11:57,000
- Because Walkers never quit.
- Walkers never quit.

1392
01:11:57,083 --> 01:11:58,083
Come on.

1393
01:11:58,541 --> 01:12:01,500
Hey. Yo, one, two, three, four.

1394
01:12:01,583 --> 01:12:04,333
Yo, Gabi. Yo, Gabi.

1395
01:12:04,416 --> 01:12:05,833
Can you guys believe this?

1396
01:12:05,916 --> 01:12:07,916
They seriously expect us to sit up here

1397
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,041
and listen to Walker's band play music
instead of us.

1398
01:12:11,125 --> 01:12:13,500
Didn't Mr. Walker
have a chance to play in Green Day?

1399
01:12:13,583 --> 01:12:16,791
- I think it was Black Sabbath.
- It was a band about a color.

1400
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:21,666
Imagine giving up the opportunity
to be a rock star

1401
01:12:22,583 --> 01:12:24,083
just to be Wyatt's dad.

1402
01:12:24,166 --> 01:12:25,541
- Like...
- That's sad.

1403
01:12:25,625 --> 01:12:28,666
- Like that's...
- I'd rather be the rock star.

1404
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:30,375
Mr. Molson, Mr. Hanes,

1405
01:12:31,041 --> 01:12:34,916
thank you so much for giving me
the opportunity to speak with you again.

1406
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,000
You're safe today.

1407
01:12:36,041 --> 01:12:38,208
- No dairy for breakfast.
- Okay.

1408
01:12:38,291 --> 01:12:39,666
Let's cut through the stench

1409
01:12:39,791 --> 01:12:43,625
and talk to you about our beautiful
building on 7th and Main.

1410
01:12:43,708 --> 01:12:44,916
- That's right. Yup.
- Jess.

1411
01:12:51,041 --> 01:12:53,708
{\an8}- Everything all right?
- What's going on? Guys?

1412
01:12:53,791 --> 01:12:55,041
{\an8}What are we doing?

1413
01:12:55,125 --> 01:12:57,291
Okay. Come on, guys.

1414
01:12:57,375 --> 01:12:58,791
- All good?
- He's leaving again.

1415
01:12:58,875 --> 01:12:59,791
Um...

1416
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:03,250
No. Mr. Molson, I'm so sorry.

1417
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,083
My family needs me.

1418
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:10,375
But I'm proud to leave you
in the very capable hands of this team.

1419
01:13:10,458 --> 01:13:13,833
They know these plans better than anyone.
They'll show you every detail.

1420
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:16,500
You've got it.

1421
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:18,125
We got it.

1422
01:13:18,208 --> 01:13:19,791
Just hold on, Jess.

1423
01:13:19,875 --> 01:13:20,875
Jess.

1424
01:13:22,708 --> 01:13:25,458
So starting with the exterior garden...

1425
01:13:25,541 --> 01:13:29,208
We want the show!
We want the show!

1426
01:13:29,291 --> 01:13:32,375
Do you not hear that?
We want the show! Where's your guy?

1427
01:13:32,458 --> 01:13:34,583
- Just one more minute.
- I don't have a minute.

1428
01:13:34,666 --> 01:13:38,541
- Wyatt, where's your dad, man?
- I don't know, Lake. I can't find him.

1429
01:13:38,625 --> 01:13:40,958
We passed on
a synchronized swim band for this.

1430
01:13:41,041 --> 01:13:42,166
- Dad.
- Bill.

1431
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:44,208
- We got here quickly.
- Where's Wyatt?

1432
01:13:44,291 --> 01:13:45,916
I've looked everywhere. I'm worried.

1433
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,916
- Let's go find him.
- We want the show!

1434
01:13:49,041 --> 01:13:51,375
- Wyatt!
- Wyatt, where are you, son?

1435
01:13:51,458 --> 01:13:53,500
Come on, dude. You're freaking us out.

1436
01:13:53,583 --> 01:13:56,416
I'll check the science wing.
You get east and west corridors.

1437
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:57,375
- Okay.
- Okay.

1438
01:13:57,458 --> 01:14:00,166
Hey, Wyatt. Wyatt.

1439
01:14:01,666 --> 01:14:02,875
- God.
- Hey, Dad.

1440
01:14:05,208 --> 01:14:06,208
Wyatt?

1441
01:14:07,458 --> 01:14:10,041
What are you doing, man?
Wipe it up. We gotta go on stage.

1442
01:14:10,125 --> 01:14:11,333
I really wish I could.

1443
01:14:11,416 --> 01:14:14,416
I just... I can't.
I'm not like you, Dad. I'm sorry.

1444
01:14:15,166 --> 01:14:16,416
What are you sorry for?

1445
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:18,125
I heard these kids talking

1446
01:14:18,208 --> 01:14:21,291
about how you were in a band
that went on to be huge,

1447
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:24,750
but you had to settle for being my dad.

1448
01:14:26,833 --> 01:14:30,875
I may have been in a band
that went on to become a huge success.

1449
01:14:30,958 --> 01:14:32,125
But so what?

1450
01:14:40,083 --> 01:14:41,541
Well, which band was it?

1451
01:14:42,666 --> 01:14:43,750
Maroon 6.

1452
01:14:44,916 --> 01:14:46,916
Isn't it Maroon 5?

1453
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,166
Yeah.

1454
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:50,875
- No way.
- Yeah.

1455
01:14:53,208 --> 01:14:54,250
Whoa.

1456
01:14:55,666 --> 01:14:57,750
Do I miss it sometimes? Yeah.

1457
01:14:58,333 --> 01:15:01,750
I mean, it's hard to accept
that your glory days are behind you,

1458
01:15:01,833 --> 01:15:05,875
but would I trade
what I have now for anything?

1459
01:15:06,666 --> 01:15:07,666
No way.

1460
01:15:08,833 --> 01:15:10,250
Being your dad

1461
01:15:11,833 --> 01:15:14,375
has been the rock 'n' roll
adventure of a lifetime.

1462
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:16,708
Come here.

1463
01:15:19,041 --> 01:15:20,083
Love you, buddy.

1464
01:15:21,416 --> 01:15:22,416
I love you, Dad.

1465
01:15:29,208 --> 01:15:31,875
- Wyatt. You okay?
- Um...

1466
01:15:33,083 --> 01:15:35,625
Well, uh, I'm not doing the show,

1467
01:15:36,291 --> 01:15:39,208
and I'm pretty sure Yale
is not gonna be callin'.

1468
01:15:39,291 --> 01:15:43,250
Yeah, and Dad or Alive
is no longer living. So...

1469
01:15:43,333 --> 01:15:44,541
If it makes you feel better,

1470
01:15:44,625 --> 01:15:47,541
I think my dreams of playing
for the national soccer team

1471
01:15:48,041 --> 01:15:49,375
are pretty much shot.

1472
01:15:49,458 --> 01:15:52,416
Yeah, and I think I can say
I no longer work at Atlas.

1473
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:55,833
I haven't heard anything from Spock
about the lens.

1474
01:15:55,916 --> 01:15:56,916
So...

1475
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:24,541
Wait, tell me that it's
for the family Christmas videos.

1476
01:16:24,625 --> 01:16:26,125
What do you mean?

1477
01:16:26,208 --> 01:16:29,125
When I'm with you guys, I'm not afraid.

1478
01:16:32,291 --> 01:16:35,250
It's just like when we were kids.
It's just us.

1479
01:16:35,333 --> 01:16:37,875
- Yeah, we'll all be right there.
- Right behind you.

1480
01:16:37,958 --> 01:16:39,750
Okay. Okay.

1481
01:16:39,833 --> 01:16:41,083

Dad or Alive.

1517
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:27,083
I was not expecting that.

1518
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,583
Dad or Alive,

1519
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:33,083
you're going to Hollywood!

1520
01:19:35,250 --> 01:19:38,250
I'm proud of you, son.
You did it! You did it!

1521
01:19:38,333 --> 01:19:40,458
Good job! Good job!

1522
01:19:40,541 --> 01:19:42,166
Jess! Jess!

1523
01:19:42,875 --> 01:19:43,875
Oh my God.

1524
01:19:44,333 --> 01:19:45,166
Amazing!

1525
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:48,583
- Mr. Molson, I can explain, sir.
- There's no need.

1526
01:19:48,666 --> 01:19:51,125
- Kara insisted I tell you in person.
- I did.

1527
01:19:51,208 --> 01:19:53,166
Your team delivered that pitch perfectly.

1528
01:19:53,250 --> 01:19:55,416
I'm awarding you
the Jefferson Gardens project.

1529
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:57,791
- Congratulations.
- We got it?

1530
01:19:57,875 --> 01:19:59,916
- We got it!
- Oh my God!

1531
01:20:00,583 --> 01:20:02,541
Way to go, partner.

1532
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:05,750
Partner? What about me?

1533
01:20:05,833 --> 01:20:07,583
- You're fired.
- Ho, ho, ho.

1534
01:20:08,958 --> 01:20:10,916
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.
- No problem.

1535
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,416
- Wyatt.
- I'm Wyatt.

1536
01:20:12,958 --> 01:20:13,875
There's been a ripple

1537
01:20:13,958 --> 01:20:16,375
in the space-time continuum,
or a glitch in the simulation.

1538
01:20:16,458 --> 01:20:17,625
I'm in my father's body.

1539
01:20:18,166 --> 01:20:19,750
- Makes sense.
- You have the lens?

1540
01:20:21,416 --> 01:20:25,375
Well, depends. You still got
that Charizard you told me about?

1541
01:20:26,083 --> 01:20:29,333
My first edition PSA-rated 10
holo Charizard card?

1542
01:20:29,833 --> 01:20:31,500
- How dare you.
- Oh, I dare.

1543
01:20:31,583 --> 01:20:33,125
That's my prized possession.

1544
01:20:33,958 --> 01:20:36,125
More prized than your own body?

1545
01:20:40,166 --> 01:20:41,583
- Take it.
- I'll take it.

1546
01:20:42,416 --> 01:20:43,791
Nice doing business with ya.

1547
01:20:43,875 --> 01:20:45,291
- We got the lens.
- We got it.

1548
01:20:45,375 --> 01:20:46,583
- We got the lens?
- Yeah.

1549
01:20:46,666 --> 01:20:48,666
How long
until the planets fall out of alignment?

1550
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:50,000
Thirty-seven minutes.

1551
01:20:50,583 --> 01:20:52,708
To get across town?
We'll need a rocket ship.

1552
01:20:59,208 --> 01:21:03,166
You asked for a rocket ship,
I give you a '69 Yenko Camaro.

1553
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:06,250
Mom, we need Pickles and Miles.

1554
01:21:06,375 --> 01:21:07,875
Wait, who's gonna drive?

1555
01:21:07,958 --> 01:21:09,666
Look, we'll do it together, okay?

1556
01:21:10,875 --> 01:21:12,875
Okay, kiddo, I got shifting and steering.

1557
01:21:12,958 --> 01:21:15,000
You got the gas,
the brake, and the clutch.

1558
01:21:15,083 --> 01:21:17,375
- What's the clutch?
- It's the other pedal.

1559
01:21:17,458 --> 01:21:19,375
- There's three pedals?
- This is your plan?

1560
01:21:19,458 --> 01:21:21,250
- Didn't say it was a good one.
- Hit it.

1561
01:21:26,791 --> 01:21:30,833
Phew. Okay, rough start.
But we're learning, all right? Here we go.

1562
01:21:30,916 --> 01:21:33,000
- Okay.
- When I say gas it, you just...

1563
01:21:38,166 --> 01:21:40,250
- Which way do we take?
- Take the 110 to the 101.

1564
01:21:40,333 --> 01:21:43,041
No. The game's just ended.
Downtown will be a parking lot.

1565
01:21:43,125 --> 01:21:44,000
Well, then what?

1566
01:21:44,083 --> 01:21:47,375
We get off at Western and go up through
Koreatown into Little Armenia.

1567
01:21:47,458 --> 01:21:49,375
Look, we just need to get
to the 101 North.

1568
01:21:49,458 --> 01:21:52,000
No. Harry Styles had a concert
at the Hollywood Bowl.

1569
01:21:52,083 --> 01:21:54,250
Man, that'll be
a One Direction nightmare, huh?

1570
01:21:54,333 --> 01:21:56,083
- Not the time, Dad.
- Yeah, sorry.

1571
01:21:56,166 --> 01:21:59,208
How about we take the 10 to the 110
to the 101 South to the five,

1572
01:21:59,291 --> 01:22:00,416
get off at Los Feliz?

1573
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:02,958
That's a very strange route.
Somebody make a decision.

1574
01:22:03,041 --> 01:22:05,666
There won't be a decision.
There's gridlock on the bridge.

1575
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,375
Guys, we're not gonna make it.

1576
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,208
We are gonna make it

1577
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,458
because Walkers never quit.

1578
01:22:23,291 --> 01:22:24,791
Go left!

1579
01:22:27,916 --> 01:22:29,041
- Watch out!
- I got this.

1580
01:22:29,125 --> 01:22:30,833
This is not a video game!

1581
01:22:30,916 --> 01:22:33,416
Feels like one! Whoa.

1582
01:22:34,375 --> 01:22:37,833
- The lens! The lens bounced out!
- It's on the hood! It's on the hood!

1583
01:22:37,916 --> 01:22:39,375
I am getting that lens.

1584
01:22:39,458 --> 01:22:41,416
Watch out for my big booty Judy!

1585
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:43,291
Careful! Hold on!

1586
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:44,708
I am getting it!

1587
01:22:44,791 --> 01:22:46,916
- Hurry up!
- Don't let go!

1588
01:22:49,458 --> 01:22:52,250
- Get back!
- I got it!

1589
01:22:56,166 --> 01:22:57,666
Wyatt!

1590
01:23:03,625 --> 01:23:05,583
Oh, man, my door.

1591
01:23:05,666 --> 01:23:09,083
Good news. Car still looks
pretty cheery on this side.

1592
01:23:14,208 --> 01:23:15,208
Shall we?

1593
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:17,750
Let's go, Walkers!

1594
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:28,958
We're gonna make it.

1595
01:23:39,166 --> 01:23:40,166
What...

1596
01:23:45,291 --> 01:23:46,500
Angelica?

1597
01:23:46,583 --> 01:23:48,041
What are you doing here?

1598
01:23:48,125 --> 01:23:51,416
I think you need
a little Christmas miracle. Get in.

1599
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:52,500
Okay.

1600
01:24:04,791 --> 01:24:07,083
- We have it. Go. Go.
- Whoa!

1601
01:24:21,416 --> 01:24:23,083
No. No. No.

1602
01:24:27,416 --> 01:24:28,750
It's not your fault.

1603
01:24:36,541 --> 01:24:39,541
Not now, Miles or Pickles
or whoever you are.

1604
01:24:41,208 --> 01:24:43,608
- What's that in his mouth?
- What do you got?

1605
01:24:51,125 --> 01:24:52,583
It's the original lens.

1606
01:24:52,666 --> 01:24:54,708
He must've picked it up
and put it in the pocket.

1607
01:24:54,791 --> 01:24:57,916
- We still have ten seconds.
- I love you, you little magpie.

1608
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,000
- Go!
- Go!

1609
01:24:59,583 --> 01:25:00,791
Come on.

1610
01:25:01,791 --> 01:25:03,583
Come on. Wyatt, go.

1611
01:25:06,458 --> 01:25:08,500
- Okay. We're good.
- You did it.

1616
01:25:35,791 --> 01:25:38,625
I don't understand.
I feel the same.

01:25:39,875 --> 01:25:40,875
Yeah, me too.

1618
01:25:47,291 --> 01:25:48,375
It didn't work.

1619
01:25:50,666 --> 01:25:51,666

We fixed the telescope.
It didn't work, but...

1628
01:26:28,208 --> 01:26:30,291
I didn't say anything
about a telescope.

1629

Yes. They're back. Are you back?

01:28:11,458 --> 01:28:14,208

01:29:11,833 --> 01:29:14,166
That's just to keep you company
when you're gone.

1669
01:29:14,958 --> 01:29:16,708
I'm actually not leaving.

1670
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:21,416
But it's okay 'cause

1671
01:29:22,750 --> 01:29:26,916
these last couple of days, I've really had
the time to realize what's important.

1672
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,458
And Yale's not going anywhere.

1673
01:29:29,333 --> 01:29:32,083
I feel like if I leave now,
I'll miss out on way too much.

1674
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:34,500
Like what?

1675
01:29:35,166 --> 01:29:38,791
Well, sharing Mr. Mistletoe with you.

1676
01:29:50,125 --> 01:29:52,583
You kiddin' me?
That's how you know it's cake.

1677
01:29:54,833 --> 01:29:57,333
- So <i>Minecraft</i> later?
- Yeah, of course.

1678
01:29:57,416 --> 01:30:00,416
All right, we'll go on my server.
Yours is a little cluttered.

1679
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:01,833
It's not.

1680
01:30:01,916 --> 01:30:04,916
Excuse me. Is this CC Walker's house?

1681
01:30:06,041 --> 01:30:07,708
Yeah. I, I'll grab her right now.

1682
01:30:07,791 --> 01:30:08,791
Thank you.

1683
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:16,208
CC, Alex Sullivan
from the US National Team.

1684
01:30:16,291 --> 01:30:18,583
Yeah. Mr. Sullivan, I know who you are.

1685
01:30:18,666 --> 01:30:21,333
My flight got delayed
because of this snowstorm,

1686
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:24,375
so I thought I'd come in person
and give you the news.

1687
01:30:25,250 --> 01:30:27,333
We'd like to officially
give you another chance.

1688
01:30:28,791 --> 01:30:31,416
Really? Even after that horrible game?

1689
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:33,375
We're looking for two things
in our players.

1690
01:30:33,458 --> 01:30:35,333
Good soccer. Good character.

1691
01:30:35,416 --> 01:30:38,083
I've seen your tapes.
I knew you were a great soccer player.

1692
01:30:38,166 --> 01:30:40,750
But when I saw you
give up a game-winning goal

1693
01:30:40,833 --> 01:30:43,583
to help an injured opponent,
I knew you had both.

1694
01:30:43,666 --> 01:30:44,791
Oh my gosh.

1695
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:49,833
Can you hold on for one second? Hey, Mom?

1696
01:30:51,541 --> 01:30:52,791
It's a miracle.

1697
01:30:55,041 --> 01:30:58,833
This is the rep from the national team.
He just offered me another chance.

1698
01:30:59,625 --> 01:31:01,125
But I'm, I'm saying no, right?

1699
01:31:02,083 --> 01:31:04,458
Wait. No.

1700
01:31:04,541 --> 01:31:07,375
- Right. I'm so sorry...
- Wait, no, we're saying yes.

1701
01:31:07,458 --> 01:31:08,833
You have to say yes.

1702
01:31:08,916 --> 01:31:11,625
And look, if soccer is the thing you love,

1703
01:31:12,875 --> 01:31:14,125
I'll be at every game.

1704
01:31:15,458 --> 01:31:16,333
Really?

1705
01:31:16,416 --> 01:31:18,375
Yeah. Try and stop me.

1706
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:19,916
Thank you!

1707
01:31:27,791 --> 01:31:29,291
Okay, I have no idea what...

1708
01:31:29,375 --> 01:31:30,291
- Yes!
- Yes!

1709
01:31:30,375 --> 01:31:31,541
Great.

1710
01:31:31,625 --> 01:31:32,875
- This is yours.
- Hey, guys!

1711
01:31:32,958 --> 01:31:33,791
Thank you.

1712
01:31:33,875 --> 01:31:36,541
- See you at the tryouts.
- Thank you so much.

1713
01:31:36,625 --> 01:31:37,833
Merry Christmas.

1714
01:31:44,375 --> 01:31:45,666
- What?
- Oh my God.

1715
01:31:47,041 --> 01:31:48,750
This is glorious!

1723
01:32:29,416 --> 01:32:31,333
I'm so sorry you're kissing your mother,

1724
01:32:32,125 --> 01:32:33,291
who's also your sister.

1725
01:32:34,041 --> 01:32:35,791
- I'm so sorry...
- Don't worry about it.

1726
01:32:36,916 --> 01:32:38,166
Upon meeting you,

1727
01:32:38,250 --> 01:32:43,041
{\an8}you seem more like a middle-aged man
of middling intelligence.

1728
01:32:43,125 --> 01:32:45,708
{\an8}Low. Middling to low intelligence.

1729
01:32:45,791 --> 01:32:48,083
Sort of an Ed Helms type.

1730
01:32:51,333 --> 01:32:52,750
What are your safety schools?

1731
01:32:52,833 --> 01:32:53,708
And you...

1732
01:32:55,958 --> 01:32:57,333
{\an8}Bazooka. Mark.

1733
01:32:57,416 --> 01:32:59,041
{\an8}Drink it ugly, and it'll work.

1734
01:32:59,125 --> 01:33:02,416
{\an8}I don't...
I am a 50-year-old refined person.

1735
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:10,208
{\an8}Oh my God.

1736
01:33:10,291 --> 01:33:12,208
So gross. Oh my gosh.

1737
01:33:12,291 --> 01:33:13,833
I am an ungrateful malcontent

1738
01:33:13,916 --> 01:33:17,166
who has no idea the kind of sacrifices
people make for me.

1739
01:33:22,250 --> 01:33:23,875
{\an8}Beelzebub. Mark.

1740
01:33:23,958 --> 01:33:26,583
Sorry? I can't hear you
'cause I have my earbuds.

1741
01:33:26,666 --> 01:33:29,333
Threw it in his face.
He caught it. Threw it back.

1742
01:33:29,416 --> 01:33:31,583
I bounced it. Bounced it. Bounced it.

1743
01:33:31,666 --> 01:33:32,791
You saved my marriage.

1744
01:33:34,458 --> 01:33:35,583
I tore a hammie.

1745
01:33:37,166 --> 01:33:38,458
Go on without me.

1746
01:33:39,333 --> 01:33:43,958
You've nothing to worry about. Your puppy
and baby are in very capable hands.

1747
01:33:44,041 --> 01:33:45,291
Sorry.

1748
01:33:45,375 --> 01:33:48,208
Are they gonna kill us?
They're freaking me out.

1749
01:33:52,791 --> 01:33:54,000
Can you unshave my legs?

1750
01:33:54,083 --> 01:33:55,541
Go back.

1751
01:33:55,625 --> 01:33:56,916
That's how you do it, ladies.

1752
01:33:58,333 --> 01:34:00,541
This is not how I thought
my life would turn out.

1753
01:34:00,625 --> 01:34:02,958
- Everything's gonna be fine.
- Yeah, Coach?

1754
01:34:03,041 --> 01:34:04,875
- Yeah, CC?
- I can't breathe.

1755
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:07,625
He's laughing.

1756
01:34:08,916 --> 01:34:11,166
Please leave this room and never return.

1757
01:34:16,458 --> 01:34:17,291
Has she cracked?

1758
01:34:17,375 --> 01:34:20,333
Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma.

1759
01:34:22,041 --> 01:34:23,500
- Emma.
- Oh.

1760
01:34:23,583 --> 01:34:24,958
It's great.

1761
01:34:25,041 --> 01:34:26,250
- Is that...
- Yeah.

1762
01:34:29,458 --> 01:34:32,000
{\an8}I'm on a new cleanse
where I just eat everything,

1763
01:34:32,666 --> 01:34:34,166
{\an8}and then that's it.

1764
01:34:34,250 --> 01:34:35,416
Kiss me. Kiss me.
