1
00:00:02,747 --> 00:00:11,604
ripped by qwerzz

2
00:00:15,281 --> 00:00:17,249
Among the first Emperors of each dynasty

3
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,446
Emperor Zhao Kuang Yin
was the most magnanimous

4
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:24,717
On his mother's bid,
he gave his throne to his Brother

5
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:28,157
Zhao Guang Yi and then to
Guang Yi's son, De wang

6
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:32,425
Kuang Yin passed his throne
to his brother Guang Yi

7
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:37,936
It had been rumoured that he was

8
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:44,441
killed by his brother in the palace

9
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,273
This had remained a mystery ever since

10
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,506
But when Guang Yi became Emperor

11
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:51,175
he forced Kuang Yin's son, De Zhao

12
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:54,344
to kill himself

13
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:10,925
De Zhao's son Zhao Jue
was crowned Prince of Xiang Yang

14
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:13,631
He was eager for revenge
and planned for a revolt

15
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,732
In his own residence he built...
the House of Traps

16
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:58,601
"Fu An Inn"

17
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:25,095
Brother... are you alright?

18
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:29,574
Brother, never mind me, chase him

19
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,075
Too late

20
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,139
"Federation of the Righteous"

21
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:37,680
who is it?

22
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:38,910
A robber

23
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,634
Just by the flying dart
and the light technique

24
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:03,641
one can tell that
the well-renowned Brother Hua is here

25
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,176
Brother Deng

26
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:11,211
This is Hua Chong, the Butterfly

27
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,251
Everyone must have heard about him

28
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:14,513
Master Hua...

29
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:22,261
Brother Hua, since you know I'm here

30
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:23,693
why did you still shoot the flying dart?

31
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:25,855
Aren't you concerned about
hurting your friend?

32
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:28,297
Precisely because I know you are here

33
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:31,700
these four darts wouldn't hit people

34
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,533
You think I'd miss?

35
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,938
Alright, let's sit down and talk

36
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:41,338
Brother Hua, this packet is...

37
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,915
It's a gift to you

38
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:53,386
I already know what it is

39
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,893
The Jade Horse lost in the palace

40
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:58,156
There's a warrant from Kaifeng county

41
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:02,223
for the robber's arrest

42
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:06,203
It was just ajoke that day at the banquet

43
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,968
not knowing that
you'd take it so seriously

44
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,633
This is nothing

45
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,472
I just don't understand why

46
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:16,139
you are here instead of the Deng Residence

47
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,911
This Horse has stirred a sensation
all over the country

48
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:21,043
You sure have the guts to steal it

49
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,317
but I don't have the guts
to keep it in Deng Residence

50
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,756
Do you see what this place is?

51
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:29,928
Federation of the Righteous

52
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:32,520
This belongs to the Prince of Xiang Yang

53
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:35,157
He's the brother of the Emperor

54
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:37,930
If the Jade Horse is hid at
the prince's residence

55
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:40,767
even Bao Zheng wouldn't dare to come

56
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:43,364
and search the place

57
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:46,240
Since the birthday of His Majesty
is drawing near

58
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,938
I'll decide for you

59
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:51,448
and send this to the Prince
as a birthday gift

60
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,451
Brother, that's very considerate of you!

61
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:54,850
His Majesty arrives

62
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,371
Your Majesty

63
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:18,944
No need to stand on ceremony

64
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:23,214
I suppose this is the renowned Butterfly

65
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,546
Yes, he is my sworn brother Hua Chong

66
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,415
Greetings to Your Majesty

67
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:29,647
Fine...

68
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:32,384
This is not the prince's residence

69
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,653
You are my VIPs

70
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:35,989
Please have a seat and chat

71
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:37,323
Thank you, Your Majesty

72
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,660
Brother, this is Shen Zhong Yuan

73
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,604
A great kung fu hero and
also His Majesty's think-tank

74
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:48,833
Nice to meet you

75
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:51,307
I've heard a lot about you

76
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,673
My sincere respects

77
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:53,837
You're too kind

78
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:54,844
Please

79
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:56,244
Please have a seat

80
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:05,257
Deng Che, chief of the Deng Fortress

81
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,950
to preside over
the Federation of the Righteous

82
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,424
I've heard from Hero Deng

83
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:12,225
that he's a sworn brother of Hero Hua

84
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:16,859
Yes, Brother Deng's business is mine too

85
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:19,699
I'll do whatever it takes

86
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:20,465
Good

87
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:23,542
I'm willing to work for Your Majesty;
even risk my life

88
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:27,306
It'd be best if Hero Hua could join us

89
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:30,849
There're heroes all over
who have pledged loyalty to me

90
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,113
Once the food and weapons are ready

91
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,950
we can start the revolt

92
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:40,890
The pledge of our allies would be
in the House of Traps

93
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:43,120
Hero Shen will bring

94
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,561
Hero Hua to sign the pledge later

95
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:46,597
Yes

96
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:49,725
Your Majesty,
the Jade Horse Brother Hua stole

97
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,303
is an Imperial treasure

98
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:54,168
It may be a good sign
that Your Majesty will be crowned

99
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:57,765
For security, may we lock it up
in the House of Traps &

100
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:00,903
bring it out for viewing
on Your Majesty's birthday?

101
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:01,911
Alright

102
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:03,979
"House of Traps"

103
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:13,382
Master Shen

104
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,620
This is Hua Chong, the Butterfly

105
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:17,662
Your fame precedes you

106
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:18,695
I am Lan Xiao

107
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:21,790
Also recommended by Master Deng
to work for the Prince

108
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:25,302
It's the Iron Man brother Lan

109
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:28,271
By the order of His Majesty,
I am here to collect

110
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:30,706
the Jade Horse to be stored
at the House of Traps

111
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,869
Master Hua is now the VIP
of the Prince's Residence

112
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,140
He can come and go at any time

113
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:36,510
you needn't worry, Brother Lan

114
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,049
Yes, Master Shen

115
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:47,985
Please

116
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:52,585
Brother Hua,
please place the Jade Horse in it

117
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:55,024
There's also a copy of the pledge

118
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:56,924
please sign it

119
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:09,599
"Fu An Inn"

120
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,041
Brother, don't bother me

121
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:18,241
Do whatever you have to do

122
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,342
Then wait for me at the inn

123
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:24,116
I hear Hua Chong has joined
the Prince of Xiang Yang

124
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:27,249
I'll go to the Prince's Residence tonight
and investigate

125
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,453
Regardless of my investigation

126
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:32,087
I'll bring you back to Kaifeng
early tomorrow morning

127
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:17,374
Someone went in,
hurry and trigger the traps

128
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:50,362
who are you?

129
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,663
So it's Lord Bao's secret emissary

130
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:58,335
Brother wang, your brother died
at the House of Traps

131
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,139
The Jade Horse
which the Butterfly has stolen

132
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:02,111
is stored at the House

133
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:04,114
There's something more important

134
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:07,185
The list of all those
participating in the revolt

135
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,049
is also stored in the House

136
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,146
I know you are wounded badly

137
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:13,782
But no matter what,
you have to go back to Kaifeng

138
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,861
and tell Lord Bao about the news

139
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:16,985
Yes

140
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:22,056
I've been fatally struck
by the Butterfly's dart

141
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:25,695
and have come here to report the news
before I die

142
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,773
I'll serve you again in my next life

143
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,409
These two brothers
are men of great loyalty

144
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,709
But there's one thing
which I don't understand

145
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,342
Prince of Xiang Yang's rebellious acts
are obvious

146
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:43,649
Your Honour's great name is well-known

147
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,121
among Kaifeng

148
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:47,089
You'd rather handle this case yourself
instead of

149
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,821
delegating it to
an inexperienced person like me

150
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,921
It's precisely because everyone knows me

151
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:55,023
If I go to Xiang Yang,

152
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:58,592
the Prince will take special precautions

153
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:00,899
But for a person like you

154
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:04,840
smart and capable, but of low profile

155
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:08,004
the Prince will be lax in guarding against

156
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:11,640
It'd be much easier to find out
his rebellious acts

157
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,878
That's why I've recommended you
to the Emperor to be

158
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:17,922
the Inspector-General of the
9 provinces of Jing Shiang

159
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:23,317
I'll send over someone
to help you discreetly all along

160
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:26,227
when you see this plaque,

161
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:29,233
you'll know that
he's the secret emissary sent by me

162
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:30,894
"Prince Xiang Yang's residence"

163
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,698
News from the capital

164
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:38,141
Lord Bao recommended
Inspector Yan to come here

165
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,109
He has come for me

166
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,180
Bao Zheng doesn't dare to come

167
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:45,307
but has asked a book-worm
to spearhead the attack

168
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,214
Once he arrives at Xiang Yang

169
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:50,288
I'll kill him;
Let's see who dares to come again

170
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:54,018
Of course it's very easy for you
to kill Yan Chun Min

171
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:57,391
But Kaifeng has lost wang Dong
and wang Liang here

172
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,987
and it's all because of the Jade Horse

173
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:03,432
I'm afraid it's not easy now
to cover up your stay here

174
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:05,025
If anything goes wrong

175
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:09,073
it may get His Majesty into trouble

176
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:11,165
Your concern is indeed warranted

177
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:14,405
Nonetheless your idea of giving a warning

178
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:15,605
isn't a bad idea

179
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:19,480
It'd keep people from
coming to Xiang Yang to inspect

180
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,213
But it's not appropriate for you to do it

181
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:25,586
Besides,
it would be an overkill to involve you

182
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,989
Alright, let's do it this way

183
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,960
The three-hand general Cao De Yu,
Fang Diao

184
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:31,757
will launch the first wave

185
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,058
Yes

186
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,361
Miao Tien Luk and Chai wan

187
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:38,698
shall launch the second wave
and kill him on the way

188
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:39,736
Yes

189
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:41,169
"Yun Lai Inn"

190
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:46,373
Please...

191
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,607
Sir, please

192
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,183
Please...

193
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,258
Sir, what do you think?

194
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:06,923
Wait, what's the charge per night?

195
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:10,331
A tael and a half,
you can't come by a better deal

196
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,304
Little housekeeper, what do you say?

197
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:15,839
One tael

198
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,570
Alright, one tael

199
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:20,235
You must be hungry

200
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:21,973
we have everything

201
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,675
I'll pick some fresh food for you

202
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:27,441
So that you could charge us
in whatever way you want?

203
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:28,747
Anyway, forget about the fresh food

204
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,981
Just get a pot of rice and two dishes

205
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,114
Alright

206
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:36,952
You dare to bully people

207
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:39,030
what are you doing?

208
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,324
It's not right to bully

209
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,700
Sir, please adjudicate

210
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:49,671
I came here for food and accommodation

211
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:52,300
He said the inn is full;
well, that's alright

212
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:55,574
But he was abusive and even pushed me

213
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,172
how could something like this be condoned?

214
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,880
Sir, if you don't mind

215
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:03,477
come and stay with me in my room

216
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:07,156
You are quite a gentleman

217
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,623
Please

218
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,565
It's Brother Bai, have you eaten?

219
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:24,164
Good question; I'm hungry indeed

220
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:25,106
waiter

221
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,199
Coming

222
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,772
Anything to eat?

223
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,976
Just add a bit more
for the pot of rice just ordered

224
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:37,619
Order what you'd like to eat

225
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,690
Anything good?

226
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:42,420
The best rice is 8 taels,
medium grade is...

227
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:45,759
No one wants anything mediocre,
just get the best

228
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,464
what's the choice of wine?

229
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:52,299
A great choice, but no single-order sale

230
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,964
Bring the whole pot then

231
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,234
Okay

232
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:08,245
Oh, fish and chicken

233
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:13,116
Some more, oh my god

234
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,249
what do you think?

235
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,497
How much would it all cost?

236
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:23,334
Such a big pot of wine,
how are we going to finish it?

237
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,300
What a nuisance

238
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,243
Brother Yan,
I'm not used to sleeping with others

239
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:42,013
Sorry that you need to
make a compromise tonight

240
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:13,637
who knows if it's just a dream,
only I can make sense

241
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:19,775
Sleeping in peace here,
my great ability awaits assent

242
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:23,645
It's already dawn

243
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,491
Sir, you are early

244
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,433
Give me the bill, I have to set off

245
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:37,433
Alright

246
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:50,443
Sir, it comes to a total of
thirteen taels forty-eight

247
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:53,211
Not much; I'll give
an additional three taels as tips

248
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:54,808
Thank you...

249
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:58,087
Brother Yan, I'd rather not have
any formality among us

250
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,658
If we are destined to meet,
we'll meet again

251
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:16,797
Oh God, someone's killed

252
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,607
Over there

253
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:34,491
"Bandit Cao De Yu"

254
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,852
"Bandit Fang Diao"

255
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:49,429
If I encounter this Bai chap again,
I won't be too kind

256
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:50,803
You don't understand

257
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:54,367
what Master Bai did seems unreasonable

258
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,276
That's why it can't be overlooked

259
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:58,645
Two robbers were killed last night
at the inn

260
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:02,015
but no one knew about it,
that's very unusual;

261
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,553
Guess it must have
something to do with Master Bai

262
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,555
I long to get acquainted with
such extraordinary people

263
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:06,351
Extraordinary?

264
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,518
His skills lie in cheating for
food and lodging

265
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:17,391
Brother Yan,
what a coincidence we meet again

266
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:23,463
If we are destined to meet,
we'll meet again

267
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:25,372
The little housekeeper is right

268
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:29,277
Your master and I are destined to meet

269
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:31,508
Master Bai,
are you supposed to go that way?

270
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:32,981
Please...

271
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:36,818
Sir, have a seat inside

272
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:49,329
I don't want to go that way now

273
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:51,129
Since we've met

274
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:52,726
and there's a restaurant here

275
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:55,238
why don't we go in for a drink?

276
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,138
Great... please

277
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,500
Brother Yan, please

278
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:01,704
welcome Sir...

279
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:03,371
Upstairs please

280
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:05,578
Upstairs please

281
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:16,018
Be careful

282
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:18,119
waiter, what's the best food?

283
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,926
Wait, who wants average food

284
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:21,726
Bring me the best

285
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:22,595
Alright

286
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,168
who wants single-order wine?

287
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:25,497
Bring the whole pot

288
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:27,504
So long as the wine is good,
you'll have your tips

289
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:29,267
Thank you

290
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:31,870
So far so good

291
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,983
Brother Yan,
where will you be staying tonight?

292
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,117
I haven't decided yet

293
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:52,025
There's an inn ahead, it's quite good

294
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,291
why don't you go with me there?

295
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:55,923
As you wish

296
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:57,763
"Fu An Inn"

297
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:04,571
Sir, how come you're back again?

298
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:07,668
I like your look

299
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,739
Sir, you are making fun of me

300
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:14,512
You know, it's because
I like your look more and more

301
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,519
that's why I'm unwilling to leave

302
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:19,454
But I don't have the money to pay;

303
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:21,549
So I went out in the street

304
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,527
and found this Master Yan

305
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:29,833
Come...

306
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:32,927
This Master Yan has a lot of money

307
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,302
That's why I came back

308
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:37,068
Sir, you're making jokes

309
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:40,076
No, I'm not. The one who'll pay is here

310
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:42,908
I can now eat and live for free

311
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:49,376
Boss, please offer us your best room

312
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,150
Alright... Please

313
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:53,746
Please

314
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:15,644
Sir, is this room okay?

315
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:18,011
So far so good

316
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:21,017
Bring the best food and whole pot of wine

317
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,518
So long as it's good,
you'll have your tips

318
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:24,589
Yes...

319
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:26,817
This little housekeeper

320
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:30,019
understands me much better

321
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:40,070
I'm not used to sleeping with other people

322
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:42,139
Sorry to make you suffer

323
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:45,870
Yu Mo, get up, don't be rude

324
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:48,738
Brother Yan, this bed

325
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:51,714
we should let
the little housekeeper to sleep

326
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:49,833
Brother Bai, is he the shopkeeper here?

327
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:50,798
That's correct

328
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:53,928
This is Prince of Xiang Yang's
secret place

329
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:56,701
The shopkeeper here
is supposed to be his guard

330
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:59,140
He is called Zheng wa

331
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:02,374
Your identity has already been exposed

332
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,471
That's why the Prince has sent someone
to kill you

333
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:05,981
Those two at the inn last time

334
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,382
were also guards at the Prince's residence

335
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:12,752
Thank you for helping me twice,
I appreciate that

336
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,757
They are all notorious bandits

337
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,622
who worked as guards
at the Prince's residence

338
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:17,956
I'm just not too happy with it

339
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:20,964
Bao Zheng is well aware
of the Prince's great power

340
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:23,000
There're so many people at Kaifeng

341
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:24,693
why did he have to
put such an important mission on

342
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:26,566
a scholar like you?

343
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:29,697
I felt it's unfair and
so I stuck my neck out

344
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:33,267
Bai Yu Tang,
you've blamed Lord Bao wrongly

345
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:36,040
I've been protecting you secretly
all the way

346
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:39,514
Lord Yan, guess you'd recognize this

347
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:43,082
So you are the secret emissary of Lord Bao

348
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:45,053
You must be Zhan Zhao?

349
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:48,148
I can't tell you my real name
at the moment

350
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:50,193
But I'm not Zhan Zhao

351
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:52,923
Bai Yu Tang,
you too have despised all the heroes

352
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:57,695
Alright, let's have a match

353
00:28:57,802 --> 00:29:00,771
Stop fooling around,
we've more important things to do

354
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:03,272
wait until
the Prince of Xiang Yang's revolt subsides

355
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:06,002
You'll know who I am

356
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:08,739
If you're still interested then

357
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:11,179
I'll be pleased to have a match with you

358
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:16,943
So you're Bai Yu Tang
who caused trouble in the capital

359
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:20,491
because you sought to spar with Zhan Zhao

360
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,356
Your fame precedes you

361
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:26,897
Lord Bao has been trying to recruit you

362
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:28,966
but you keep refusing

363
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:31,467
I wonder why you would help me!

364
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:33,036
I must fight against all this injustice

365
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:34,435
and so I repeatedly played tricks on you

366
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:37,030
But if you are a sycophant

367
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:39,838
I wouldn't care less

368
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,208
Lord Bao has his own difficulties

369
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:44,543
we'll talk about this later

370
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:47,618
we seem to get on well

371
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:51,177
what do you say we became blood brothers?

372
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:55,020
You're a high rank official
and me just an ordinary chap

373
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,616
I fear it'd be way out of my league

374
00:29:56,728 --> 00:30:00,323
You're a great hero of the time,
how can you say this?

375
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:04,197
Um, I look older than you

376
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,667
so maybe I'll be the big brother

377
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,965
If so, please

378
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:09,964
accept my greetings

379
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:13,869
Brother

380
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:15,737
"Inspector's residence"

381
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:26,883
Order in the court

382
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,221
"Prince Xiang Yang's residence"

383
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:37,426
Your Majesty,
Yan Chun Min has arrived at the office

384
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:41,369
I didn't expect he got

385
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:43,497
the assistance of Bai Yu Tang, the Rat

386
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:45,166
The two teams we've sent

387
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:48,268
together with Zhang wa
have failed the mission

388
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,611
If I were to go,
it wouldn't have come to this

389
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:54,309
Brother Hua, no need to be angry

390
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:57,388
who would have thought that Bai Yu Tang

391
00:30:57,488 --> 00:30:58,853
would change sides and help Bao Zheng

392
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:01,687
That's right, maybe we ought to
get rid of Bai Yu Tang

393
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:04,887
Yan Chun Min is just a scholar

394
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:07,191
and we needn't fear him then

395
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,764
Bao Zheng should be in deep trouble

396
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,668
It's heard that
the palace has lost the pearl crown

397
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:17,673
This incident will be
the responsibility of the Kaifeng

398
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:20,369
No one knows who did that

399
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:22,241
Let's just sit back and watch

400
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:30,714
"wanted:
The thief who stole the pearl crown"

401
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,603
Your kung fu is marvelous

402
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:49,297
How about working for
the Federation of the Righteous

403
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:53,776
what?
I'm afraid I've gone to the wrong place

404
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:56,039
I thought this place traded in booty

405
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:00,115
Friend, what do you mean?

406
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:01,708
What do I mean?

407
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:04,014
I heard that this place bought booty

408
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:05,555
I've just stolen something

409
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:07,852
so I want to bring it in
and get a good price for it

410
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:09,449
This is the Federation of the Righteous

411
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,790
so I must be in the wrong place

412
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:16,999
Friend, this belongs to
the Prince of Xiang Yang

413
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:20,332
It's not the place for you
to create trouble

414
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:23,905
what? I've heard that a couple of days ago

415
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:27,774
the Butterfly has stolen
ajade horse from the capital

416
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:31,042
He becomes a VIP once he came here

417
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:33,709
I thought this is the place

418
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:35,342
which traded in booty

419
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,284
So I've also stolen something

420
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:39,322
hoping to get some profit here

421
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,789
not knowing that you...

422
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:45,262
I am Hua, we haven't met before

423
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:47,228
You keep saying we are thieves

424
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:49,698
so you are teasing me, right?

425
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,769
Well said

426
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:54,599
I am proud we have such a friend with us

427
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:56,833
to glorify us thieves

428
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:59,535
You steal treasures from the palace

429
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:03,205
and became VIP
once at the Prince's residence

430
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:07,410
It's such a glorious thing
to be a thief like this

431
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:11,720
You keep talking about thievery

432
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,791
what do you want?

433
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:14,983
Not much

434
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:19,086
I'm a thief too
and just seek to share some glory

435
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:20,494
I've also stolen something

436
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:23,328
I wonder if you'll take this

437
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,760
Stealing is stealing,
and robbing is robbing

438
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,304
It depends on what you've stolen

439
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:30,397
I'm afraid the stuff you've stolen

440
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:33,602
is no match for my jade horse

441
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:37,281
Maybe not;, do you recall

442
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:39,316
any big case recently

443
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:41,612
that is comparable
to the stolen Jade Horse?

444
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:47,419
Could you be the one
who has stolen the pearl crown

445
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:48,253
at the imperial palace?

446
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,758
Precisely

447
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:53,457
Let's see if this is genuine or fake

448
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,444
Here it is

449
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,070
A treasure of the court could hardly be

450
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:12,172
replicated by ordinary folks

451
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:14,478
So you come here today

452
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:17,110
just because you want a contest with me

453
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,655
I wouldn't dare; your chained flying dart

454
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:21,622
is well-known in the martial arts world

455
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,752
How would I have the guts
to challenge you!

456
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:26,454
Once you fling your darts

457
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,191
I'll be dead

458
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:30,358
It's good that you understand

459
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:34,027
I'm sorry Master Hua,
your darts are all here

460
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,811
This is simply petty burglary,
no skill at all

461
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,248
what's your real skill?

462
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:49,410
Master Hua, I'm here today

463
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,680
It'll be too disappointing

464
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:52,915
if we don't have a match

465
00:35:57,188 --> 00:36:01,147
Stop, we are all friends

466
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:09,959
Brother Hua, please forgive him

467
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:12,092
this brother of mine loves tojoke

468
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:15,798
Master Shen's brother is...

469
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:19,206
The renowned Black Fox, Zhi Hua

470
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,402
That's right

471
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:26,544
Brother Hua, don't be suspicious

472
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:29,313
Master Zhi is well known long before

473
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,412
for being humorous; he's a good friend

474
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:35,617
Master Zhi, your fame precedes you

475
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:38,593
I won't mind
even if you have made fun of me

476
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:41,893
But His Majesty's business
is no small matter

477
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:43,159
Alright...

478
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:56,745
Brother Hua has stolen the Jade Horse

479
00:36:56,847 --> 00:36:59,179
Brother Zhi has stolen the pearl crown

480
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:00,978
They are all imperial treasures

481
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:03,383
There're warrants for their arrest

482
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:05,421
and there's no turning back for them

483
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:09,220
So they only have to be loyal
to His Majesty

484
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:12,391
Zhong Yuan, you know me

485
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:14,020
I'm weird at times

486
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:16,565
Sometimes I don't mind
being taken advantage of

487
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:18,191
If I knew what we stole

488
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:20,236
went to this same place

489
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:22,135
You tell him that

490
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,832
we are doing things in

491
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:25,841
different ways

492
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:28,434
I don't mind to let him have an upper hand

493
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:30,104
and say what should I steal

494
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:32,182
before I could prove my loyalty
to His Majesty

495
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:35,275
Let him name something
and I'll steal it back

496
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:36,751
Brother

497
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,414
There's no need, we all are good friends

498
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:42,719
It ain't so

499
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:43,759
You know my character

500
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:46,728
I am tough like a rock

501
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:48,628
You must think of something

502
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:51,600
Brother, maybe...

503
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:52,566
If you don't want to

504
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,365
I'll think of something myself

505
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:57,168
How about the seal of the special envoy

506
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,266
Do you think this would be adequate?

507
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:07,144
Good, I am holding a feast
to celebrate your success

508
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:23,194
Hero Zhi's kung fu is very good

509
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,532
and resourceful;
I think he wouldn't be in any danger

510
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:29,435
However, we could have the feast first

511
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,509
while we await his return

512
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:37,880
what are you doing?

513
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:42,577
The seal

514
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:47,454
Sire, congratulations

515
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:50,152
Brother Zhi has stolen the seal

516
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:55,561
Brother Hua, sorry

517
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,566
Hope I didn't dirty your clothes

518
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,863
Clear the table quickly

519
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:05,241
Congratulations on your success

520
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,901
Please come to the feast

521
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,115
You work very stealthily

522
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:20,452
I am anxious to know how you did it

523
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:21,786
I followed brother Hua's way

524
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:24,884
I pretended to be caught

525
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:28,959
Mr Hua, I'm teasing you, it's true

526
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:30,590
when I left

527
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,191
I was thinking

528
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:35,500
I had to steal Yan Chun Min's seal

529
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:37,904
How could I do it?

530
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:40,067
Stealing the seal shouldn't be difficult

531
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:43,010
the challenge is knowing where it was

532
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:47,847
Then I thought I might as well

533
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:50,785
go to his place and assassinate him

534
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:58,125
His officials naturally

535
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,526
were not my match

536
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,996
So I pretended

537
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,192
to be captured by them

538
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:06,465
Yan Chun Min asked me...

539
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,730
'what are you doing here? '

540
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:09,032
I replied...

541
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:11,899
'I came to kill you'

542
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:15,407
So I confessed, right?

543
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:17,542
Then he asked me...

544
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:22,051
'who asked you to do it? '

545
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:28,786
I said... no rush... someone did direct me

546
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:30,485
and he is a man of position

547
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,027
But if I didn't tell you

548
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:33,426
you would question me for sure

549
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:36,364
and might use torture on me

550
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:38,628
I am not afraid of death, but of torture

551
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:40,465
As soon as you write a note

552
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:43,301
that says to execute me by beheading

553
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:45,637
and put your seal on it

554
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:46,937
Then I will confess

555
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:48,671
Great plan

556
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,077
He fell for it

557
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:55,084
no sooner was the note written
and chopped by the seal

558
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:56,551
I moved swiftly

559
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:59,054
I broke the ropes

560
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:03,824
and pushed down the officials;
I leapt on the table

561
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:06,822
and snatched the note and the seal

562
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:10,728
Then I jumped over the wall and ran

563
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:16,035
At that time Yan Chun Min

564
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,166
was trembling under his desk

565
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:21,644
Great

566
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:29,517
This is the note

567
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:32,955
The great robber Zhi Hua
who set out to assassinate me

568
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:37,790
will be beheaded on sight- Yan Chun Min

569
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:40,762
Mr Zhi, you are a true hero

570
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:41,991
That's wonderful

571
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:44,932
I propose a toast to you... Here, come on

572
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:54,339
Hero Shen, after the feast
please take hero Zhi

573
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:55,742
to the House of Traps

574
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,780
and put the seal,
together with the pearl crown

575
00:41:57,882 --> 00:42:01,215
and the jade horse in it

576
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:03,684
And you also sign your name tojoin us

577
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:05,015
Thank you

578
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:08,819
You're welcome.
I only hope to unite all heroes

579
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:12,987
and win back my kingdom

580
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,367
His Majesty has put
all these important items

581
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,174
in the House of Traps

582
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:34,149
If they're stolen,
wouldn't that be a waste of efforts?

583
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:37,345
Don't worry, the house has many traps;

584
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:40,389
it is fool-proof

585
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:43,927
Mr Lan, could you demonstrate to us

586
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,723
how these traps work?

587
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:48,024
He'll be less worried that way

588
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:49,030
Alright

589
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,594
Behind this trap door are guards

590
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:07,712
If the intruder has great kung fu

591
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:09,342
and they fail to withstand his attack

592
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:12,183
They'll fall back

593
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,229
The gate will fall

594
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:26,534
But the intruders will only be trapped,
not injured

595
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:33,307
Master Zhi, please go up the stairs

596
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:34,768
Please

597
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:51,053
Not bad, but the intruder

598
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:52,526
might leap right on top of the stairs

599
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,427
Please go up to the next floor

600
00:44:04,908 --> 00:44:06,535
Not bad

601
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,544
But if the intruder has
great jumping technique

602
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:11,206
he could get to the second floor easily

603
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:14,375
The 2nd floor
has the deadly copper net trap

604
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:22,651
Brother, I heard today in the court room

605
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,057
Zhi Hua pretended to be caught

606
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:27,130
and robbed the seal; was that really so?

607
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:31,259
Yes, indeed

608
00:44:31,368 --> 00:44:33,563
Zhi Hua has great skills and quite a hero

609
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,434
why do you say this?

610
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:36,437
This Zhi Hua

611
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,906
is notorious for his treachery

612
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,601
He is known as the Black Fox

613
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:43,305
If I were here
you wouldn't have fallen for his tricks

614
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:46,144
You went out just because of the duty

615
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,774
After a day's investigation

616
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:50,149
I confirmed that
the Prince formed the Federation of

617
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:52,586
the Uprighteous to unite the mercenaries

618
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,783
and built the House of Traps

619
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:58,419
with traps guarding
stolen treasures from the court

620
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,087
It is obvious Zhi Hua

621
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,597
has joined him and stolen your seal

622
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,691
to claim his credit

623
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:05,931
I am afraid so

624
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:08,004
You can't lose your seal

625
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:09,936
I plan to go
to the prince's residence tonight

626
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,338
and see how good

627
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:13,933
are that Zhi Hua and Hua Chong

628
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:16,740
And how deadly are the traps
in the House of Traps

629
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:19,513
No doubt the seal has been lost

630
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:22,585
with Lord Bao's support however,
it would be alright

631
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:24,745
You shouldn't underestimate dangers

632
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:28,518
Right, but having the seal stolen
is a grave matter

633
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:31,389
Besides,
I want to have a go at that Zhi Hua

634
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:34,589
The House of Traps is very dangerous

635
00:45:34,698 --> 00:45:37,690
wang Tung of Kaifeng also died there

636
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:41,396
we must have a meticulous plan

637
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:43,632
Don't be rash

638
00:45:52,683 --> 00:45:55,049
Brother, where are you going?

639
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:58,751
Since you wouldn't let me go,
I'm off to sleep

640
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:00,221
That's the right thing to do

641
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:07,091
The traps here are really deadly;

642
00:46:07,197 --> 00:46:08,755
especially the copper net trap

643
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:10,959
But if you are not here to launch it

644
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:13,559
it'd be useless

645
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:15,763
You needn't worry

646
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:19,206
Since Brother Lan turned off
the main switch outside,

647
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:21,869
he'd need to launch the traps one by one

648
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:23,776
If the main switch was turned on,

649
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:28,545
the traps will
go into action automatically

650
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:30,313
I see

651
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:31,682
You understand now?

652
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:34,451
Brother Lan

653
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:07,418
The pearl crown could be placed inside

654
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:09,492
and please sign tojoin in too

655
00:47:09,593 --> 00:47:10,491
Sure

656
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:47,494
Master Deng guessed right

657
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:49,996
why let him in on purpose?

658
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,727
Master Deng told me privately

659
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:53,666
that he will offer me a great credit

660
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:55,761
He said Yan Chun Min lost his seal

661
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:58,774
So Bai Yu Tang must come tonight

662
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,707
If we could get rid of him

663
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:04,076
Yan Chun Min wouldn't do any harm

664
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:06,706
we'll have done a great deed
for his majesty

665
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:08,546
Then set the traps in motion

666
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:10,449
Right, once inside the House of Traps

667
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,351
Bai Yu Tang is dead

668
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:05,068
Black Fox Zhi Hua?

669
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:08,174
Though my nickname is not good

670
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:09,870
I was sent by Lord Bao

671
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,608
Lord Yan, you must know this

672
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:20,482
So you are his secret emissary, please

673
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:30,723
I have come to return Lord Yan's seal

674
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:35,063
Then why did you

675
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:36,469
rob it during the day?

676
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:39,838
Lord Bao asked me to
sneak into the Prince's Residence

677
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:43,003
Though I stole the pearl crown

678
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:46,207
Prince of Xiang Yang
might not be fully convinced

679
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:49,752
The incident of the seal
should shock the whole city

680
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:52,378
and Prince of Xiang Yang
would have no more suspicion

681
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:53,751
and I could accomplish my task easily

682
00:49:53,857 --> 00:49:56,382
So the seal...

683
00:49:57,394 --> 00:49:58,452
Before I came here

684
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:00,553
I made a fake seal

685
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:01,756
for the Prince of Xiang Yang

686
00:50:01,865 --> 00:50:03,992
The fake seal is in the House of Traps

687
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:05,659
I have the real one

688
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:08,738
I also asked Lord Bao to
notify the court secretly

689
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:09,999
that the seal had not been lost

690
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:11,369
All that occurred in the court room

691
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:13,739
was merely a show

692
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,312
You have thought of everything

693
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:20,110
Brother Bai was worried about
the loss of my seal

694
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:22,617
and insisted on going to retrieve it

695
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:25,051
I stopped him

696
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:26,782
I'll send someone to get him

697
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:28,517
to meet you now

698
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:29,717
Good

699
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:44,134
Brother Bai has great skills
and is upright

700
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:45,708
but he is a bit rash

701
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:48,539
He saw me robbing the seal

702
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:49,839
and must have felt bad

703
00:50:49,946 --> 00:50:52,574
Please explain on my behalf
when he is here

704
00:50:52,682 --> 00:50:53,979
Naturally

705
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:57,713
Master, Lord Bai is not in his room

706
00:50:57,821 --> 00:50:59,880
Oh dear, he must have gone
to the House of Traps

707
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:01,480
I'll go back at once

708
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,071
Brother Lan, he must be dead

709
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:23,373
put him down

710
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:46,659
Bai Yu Tang is dead

711
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:51,033
He's dead

712
00:51:58,982 --> 00:52:02,008
I was thinking

713
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:06,579
Descendants of late Emperors
are vying for the throne

714
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:09,158
Heroes are being involved

715
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:12,854
and many want fame

716
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,261
Unlike us

717
00:52:15,365 --> 00:52:17,890
who enjoy a care-free life on this island

718
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:19,935
You are right, big brother

719
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:22,231
but fifth brother might think differently

720
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:24,864
I know him well

721
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,910
He is young, rash and impetuous

722
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:30,673
but he is not after fame or riches

723
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:32,475
He might not agree to work for Lord Bao

724
00:52:32,582 --> 00:52:35,813
That's the point,
fifth brother is ambitious

725
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:38,581
and would easily
blend into this environment

726
00:52:38,688 --> 00:52:40,849
Once in, it's not easy to get out

727
00:52:40,957 --> 00:52:43,448
Masters

728
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:44,622
Report to fourth master

729
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:45,717
Master Bai and Inspector Yan Chun Min

730
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:47,262
became blood brothers

731
00:52:47,364 --> 00:52:48,729
He went to the Prince's residence
to get back his seal

732
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,629
and died in the House of Traps

733
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:53,058
what's to be done?

734
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:58,141
I declined lord Bao
despite his many invitations

735
00:52:58,241 --> 00:53:01,005
but I must avenge fifth brother

736
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:02,271
You're right

737
00:53:02,379 --> 00:53:03,812
Coming...

738
00:53:06,883 --> 00:53:09,351
we'll do according to your instructions

739
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:10,441
Master Zhi

740
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:17,186
Mr Xu, what do these men do?

741
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:19,626
Your Majesty birthday's is near,
these are tile makers

742
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:23,426
here to mend the roof;
sorry for disturbing you

743
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:25,797
It's alright

744
00:53:27,103 --> 00:53:30,072
Check the roofs of
every part of the residence

745
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:32,004
and replace the damaged tiles
with new ones

746
00:53:32,108 --> 00:53:33,302
Yes...

747
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:47,587
There are many affairs
I have to manage these days

748
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:50,626
I fear I might not serve you well

749
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:51,985
Ai Fu, come here

750
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,892
He has worked here since he was a kid

751
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:02,699
If you need anything just ask him

752
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:12,639
Serve Master Zhi well

753
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:13,773
and don't sneak away to

754
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:16,784
practise your kung fu

755
00:54:19,122 --> 00:54:20,316
You practise kung fu too?

756
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:21,913
It's quite a funny story

757
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:25,825
Masters like Master Zhi, Master Shen

758
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:29,228
Master Deng and Master Hua

759
00:54:29,332 --> 00:54:32,392
are all top martial artists

760
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:35,869
Even this kid practices kung fu;
what ajoke!

761
00:54:36,973 --> 00:54:37,837
Not really

762
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:40,466
The best kung fu is accomplished by
steady practice

763
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:42,909
No one is born a martial artist

764
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:46,945
when I have time I'll show you a few moves

765
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:48,244
Thank you, Mr Zhi

766
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:05,226
Mr Zhi, Mr Shen

767
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:07,166
You look quite busy

768
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:11,070
The residence must look new
for his highness' birthday

769
00:55:11,174 --> 00:55:13,142
Go about your work, never mind us

770
00:55:13,243 --> 00:55:14,904
Yes

771
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:30,686
Look at that fellow digging

772
00:55:30,794 --> 00:55:32,421
doesn't he look familiar?

773
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:36,455
Who could a workman resemble?

774
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:42,565
Your kung fu is not bad

775
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:44,367
I am a tile maker

776
00:55:44,474 --> 00:55:46,806
I am used to climbing, no kung fu at all

777
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:49,003
Climbing is also a kind of kung fu

778
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:50,841
There is a Sky Rat

779
00:55:50,947 --> 00:55:52,608
who is known for scaling heights

780
00:55:52,716 --> 00:55:54,240
I wouldn't know about him

781
00:56:07,464 --> 00:56:09,989
Are you suspicious that those two

782
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:12,091
might be the Sky Rat, Lu Fang

783
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:14,136
and Han Zhang, the Ground Rat?

784
00:56:14,237 --> 00:56:15,795
Just a little doubt

785
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:19,170
Bai Yu Tang is dead, they should be here

786
00:56:22,846 --> 00:56:26,839
Please have some tea

787
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:42,927
Come in... careful

788
00:56:43,032 --> 00:56:45,500
Carry it into the living room

789
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:55,776
Here

790
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:57,778
what's the matter?

791
00:56:57,881 --> 00:56:58,905
What are you doing here?

792
00:56:59,015 --> 00:57:01,245
This is the prince's residence,
don't run around

793
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:03,182
That's great

794
00:57:03,286 --> 00:57:04,310
That's where we want to go

795
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:05,820
Let's go

796
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:07,184
No entry

797
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:09,053
Let us in

798
00:57:12,128 --> 00:57:13,527
Stop that noise...

799
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:18,561
what are you doing here?

800
00:57:19,402 --> 00:57:22,667
A palace should have a king, right?

801
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:24,069
Naturally

802
00:57:24,174 --> 00:57:26,506
I hear he is going to
celebrate his birthday, isn't it?

803
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:28,201
Yes

804
00:57:28,311 --> 00:57:29,801
we are acrobats

805
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:32,381
and could entertain His Highness

806
00:57:32,482 --> 00:57:33,779
Right

807
00:57:34,317 --> 00:57:36,410
what has celebrating birthday
to do with acrobats?

808
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:41,047
Celebrating birthday should be joyous

809
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:45,659
and should not show a crying face

810
00:57:47,897 --> 00:57:50,491
what are you doing? Get lost

811
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,734
You drive us away, we'll cry

812
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:54,827
Let us stay, we'll laugh

813
00:57:54,938 --> 00:57:56,337
Get lost

814
00:58:24,634 --> 00:58:27,262
You made Mr Xu neither cry nor laugh

815
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:32,203
Master Zhi, Master Shen

816
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:37,445
These two are agile

817
00:58:37,547 --> 00:58:39,276
Looks like they know some kung fu

818
00:58:39,382 --> 00:58:41,145
Zhong Yuan, what's with you?

819
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:43,219
Last couple of days
you think everyone knows kung-fu

820
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:45,150
they are just street performers

821
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:46,313
They only know magic

822
00:58:46,422 --> 00:58:49,823
That's right, we only know magic

823
00:58:49,926 --> 00:58:54,420
we could shift and
delude perceptions in many ways

824
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:22,381
It's getting unacceptable, drive them out

825
00:59:22,492 --> 00:59:24,153
Get out...

826
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:27,388
Turtle is an auspicious sign
for His Majesty's birthday

827
00:59:27,497 --> 00:59:29,465
why drive it out?

828
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:32,467
That's right,
it's a good symbol for His Majesty

829
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:35,470
Mr Xu, you should let them stay

830
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:38,401
Yes

831
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:39,293
Ai Fu, come with me

832
01:00:39,402 --> 01:00:40,300
Yes

833
01:01:00,189 --> 01:01:01,656
Ai Fu, did you see that?

834
01:01:01,758 --> 01:01:02,452
Yes

835
01:01:02,558 --> 01:01:04,253
These two are Lu Fang and Han Zhang

836
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,794
of the Five Rats

837
01:01:06,896 --> 01:01:08,955
Ai Fu, what do you intend to do?

838
01:01:09,065 --> 01:01:10,726
Whatever Master Zhi says

839
01:01:11,134 --> 01:01:12,533
well said

840
01:01:12,635 --> 01:01:14,500
You seldom talk

841
01:01:14,604 --> 01:01:16,731
Maybe you'd like to tell me
what's on your mind

842
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:20,036
I think Master Zhi knows that very well

843
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:22,873
Being a nobody in the Prince's residence

844
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:25,743
I don't know
when I'll have a successful career

845
01:01:29,919 --> 01:01:31,079
what would you consider as successful?

846
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:34,020
Make a name for yourself
in the martial arts world?

847
01:01:34,123 --> 01:01:35,556
That's exactly right

848
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:37,585
The martial arts world is full of dangers

849
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:39,525
I've heard that
your parents were security escorts

850
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:41,859
and were killed, leaving you as an orphan

851
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:43,056
My parents were attacked

852
01:01:43,166 --> 01:01:46,465
by a powerful gang and were badly wounded

853
01:01:46,569 --> 01:01:49,094
But they killed over ten of them
before they died

854
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:51,867
Everyone in the martial world
regards them as heroes

855
01:01:51,974 --> 01:01:54,636
I'd rather die a glorious death

856
01:01:54,744 --> 01:01:57,269
than be a slave for the rest of my life

857
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,041
Good

858
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:00,342
what if I took you as my student?

859
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:02,975
Teacher, please accept my greetings

860
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:09,715
Now you have the opportunity

861
01:02:09,826 --> 01:02:11,316
to do a great deed

862
01:02:11,427 --> 01:02:12,894
It'd all depend on your own courage

863
01:02:12,995 --> 01:02:16,988
I'll go through hell
to accomplish teacher's teaching

864
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:20,596
Report the Prince's rebellion case
to Inspector-General

865
01:02:20,703 --> 01:02:21,931
Go at once

866
01:02:28,978 --> 01:02:31,708
Brother, you are wrong

867
01:02:31,814 --> 01:02:33,577
You saw that Lu Fang

868
01:02:33,683 --> 01:02:36,550
and Han Zhang have bad intention

869
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:39,485
You didn't stop them
but took Ai Fu as your student

870
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:42,615
and ask him to sue the Prince,
what is your intention?

871
01:02:42,725 --> 01:02:45,694
Yes, I don't trust him

872
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:47,729
so I wanted to test him, then you arrived

873
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:50,731
Ai Fu, you have planned to rebel
against his highness

874
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:52,528
follow me to accept your punishment

875
01:02:56,005 --> 01:02:57,802
Right, Zhong Yuan

876
01:02:57,907 --> 01:03:00,398
It's about time for the truth

877
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:02,978
aren't you Lord Bao's secret emissary?

878
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:06,309
I couldn't hide it from you after all

879
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:11,011
You may not wish to test Ai Fu, but I do

880
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,680
I want to test how brave he is

881
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,519
He went to the Inspector-General
to expose the crime

882
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,525
Lord Yan has yet to win
the confidence of the people

883
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:19,857
He has no choice but to go by the book

884
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:22,795
He would inevitably suffer torture

885
01:03:22,899 --> 01:03:27,097
and if he breaks down
he'll mess up the whole thing

886
01:03:27,203 --> 01:03:30,934
I believe he has the guts to do it

887
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,905
How did you guess

888
01:03:33,009 --> 01:03:35,341
I am Lord Bao's secret emissary?

889
01:03:35,444 --> 01:03:37,105
Merely a guess

890
01:03:37,213 --> 01:03:39,443
I heard you didn't show Hua Chong
the traps

891
01:03:39,549 --> 01:03:41,176
when you brought him along
to the House of Traps

892
01:03:41,284 --> 01:03:42,546
when you brought me there

893
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:45,382
you asked Lan Xiao to show me
how each trap worked

894
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:47,854
It was obvious you wanted to show me

895
01:03:47,957 --> 01:03:49,117
how they worked

896
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:51,989
That gave me the lead

897
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:05,105
Lord Yan

898
01:04:06,075 --> 01:04:07,201
Hero Zhi

899
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:13,448
Yu Mo, wait at the door

900
01:04:13,549 --> 01:04:16,074
no one comes in here without permission

901
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:17,508
Yes

902
01:04:33,836 --> 01:04:35,929
You must have something in mind
so as to come here

903
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:37,266
You must know

904
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:39,136
Bai Yu Tang has 4 blood brothers

905
01:04:39,242 --> 01:04:42,370
Lu Fang, the Sky Rat and
Han Zhang, the Ground Rat

906
01:04:42,478 --> 01:04:45,777
Xu Qing, the Mountain Rat,
Jiang Ping, the River Rat

907
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:48,009
The five of them live on Xian Kong island

908
01:04:48,117 --> 01:04:49,641
calling themselves
the Five Rats of Xian Kong

909
01:04:49,752 --> 01:04:51,982
People call them the Righteous Five

910
01:04:52,088 --> 01:04:53,680
I heard brother Bai mention this

911
01:04:53,789 --> 01:04:56,223
Lord Bao had long wanted to recruit them

912
01:04:56,325 --> 01:04:58,452
but they kept declining

913
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:00,620
Now because of Bai Yu Tang's death

914
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:03,392
they have accepted
the invitation from Lord Bao

915
01:05:03,499 --> 01:05:05,296
to avenge Bai Yu Tang

916
01:05:05,935 --> 01:05:08,426
I suspected that now they have

917
01:05:08,537 --> 01:05:10,562
sneaked into residence of the Prince

918
01:05:10,673 --> 01:05:11,662
Now in the residence of the Prince

919
01:05:11,774 --> 01:05:13,799
There're 6 secret emissaries of
Lord Bao staying there

920
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,901
Besides me and the Four Rats

921
01:05:16,012 --> 01:05:17,639
there is also Shen Zhong Yuan

922
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:19,840
They all have the plaque of Kaifeng

923
01:05:19,949 --> 01:05:20,938
I know

924
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:23,280
The men inside the Prince's residence

925
01:05:23,386 --> 01:05:24,148
would be adequate to do the job

926
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:25,652
If you wish to capture the Prince,

927
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:27,416
you could do it now

928
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:32,690
In any case
he is the grandson of the late emperor

929
01:05:32,795 --> 01:05:35,923
He enjoys a respected position

930
01:05:36,032 --> 01:05:38,227
If we don't have a legitimate reason

931
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:40,928
how could we search his place
and the House of Traps

932
01:05:41,037 --> 01:05:43,198
and retrieve the stolen treasures

933
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:45,570
and the list of the rebels

934
01:05:45,675 --> 01:05:46,801
to prove his treason

935
01:05:46,909 --> 01:05:48,171
I have made some preparations

936
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:50,871
There's a servant named Ai Fu
at the Prince's residence

937
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:52,948
This kid is sharp and courageous

938
01:05:53,049 --> 01:05:54,414
He's good in kung fu and

939
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:56,041
awaits a good chance

940
01:05:56,152 --> 01:05:57,744
I've already taken him as my student

941
01:05:57,853 --> 01:05:59,514
Day after tomorrow
is the birthday of the Prince

942
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:01,385
It'll be a busy day at the Residence

943
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:04,755
I've asked him to appear in court
to sue the Prince

944
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:06,760
would this be an excuse then?

945
01:06:07,596 --> 01:06:08,790
Yes, indeed

946
01:06:08,898 --> 01:06:11,366
By the law of Song,
if a slave wants to sue the master

947
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:14,265
he'd have to suffer flogging

948
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:17,237
I fear he can't endure torture
and change his confession

949
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:18,500
that'll cause more troubles

950
01:06:18,607 --> 01:06:19,904
Don't worry

951
01:06:20,009 --> 01:06:21,704
This kid will be able to tolerate

952
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:23,802
You then bring Ai Fu to cross-examine
with the Prince

953
01:06:23,913 --> 01:06:25,744
while I'll bring my men
to the House of Traps

954
01:06:25,848 --> 01:06:27,145
to catch them unprepared

955
01:06:27,249 --> 01:06:28,876
This way they can't deal with
two things at one time

956
01:06:38,761 --> 01:06:42,197
Order in the court

957
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:53,539
Bring the complainant

958
01:06:53,642 --> 01:06:54,666
Yes

959
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:00,373
Kneel

960
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:04,016
what's your name?

961
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,850
Ai Fu,
I am a servant of the Prince's residence

962
01:07:06,956 --> 01:07:09,220
what is your complaint?

963
01:07:09,325 --> 01:07:12,852
I want to report a revolt case

964
01:07:13,729 --> 01:07:16,493
Someone at the Prince's residence
wants to revolt?

965
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:19,261
It is the Prince of Xiang Yang himself

966
01:07:19,668 --> 01:07:22,831
How dare you, you are only a young servant

967
01:07:22,938 --> 01:07:25,964
Do you realise
that this is a serious accusation?

968
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:28,942
Prince holds great respect,
if you accuse him wrongly

969
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:30,478
you'd suffer the consequences

970
01:07:30,579 --> 01:07:33,605
I am young but not ignorant

971
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:36,549
and I won't dare talk foolishly

972
01:07:36,652 --> 01:07:40,486
Prince has really recruited rebels
preparing for revolt

973
01:07:40,589 --> 01:07:42,989
I love my country

974
01:07:43,092 --> 01:07:45,185
and that's why I risk my life
to report the case

975
01:07:45,294 --> 01:07:47,785
Is that really so, what proof do you have?

976
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:50,764
The Jade Horse and the pearl crown
which the court lost

977
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:53,733
are hidden in the House of Traps

978
01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:56,828
The ones who stole them,
Hua Chong, Zhi Hua

979
01:07:56,939 --> 01:07:58,406
are hiding at the Prince's Residence too

980
01:07:58,507 --> 01:08:01,067
If Your Lordship would
send men to search there

981
01:08:01,177 --> 01:08:03,236
you'll catch them red-handed

982
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:06,305
Do you know
that a servant suing his master

983
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:09,350
will have to suffer flogging?

984
01:08:09,452 --> 01:08:12,012
I am here to risk life for my country

985
01:08:12,121 --> 01:08:14,646
My own life is of no importance to me

986
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:19,217
Alright,
prepare for the instruments of torture

987
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:20,260
Yes

988
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:51,111
Ai Fu, do you want to
change your confession?

989
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:52,847
It's true that
the Prince is planning a revolt

990
01:09:52,955 --> 01:09:55,287
I won't change it

991
01:09:55,391 --> 01:09:58,224
Good, a great hero

992
01:09:58,327 --> 01:09:59,658
Let him down

993
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:05,924
Let's move to the residence
of the Prince of Xiang Yang

994
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:06,933
Yes

995
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:10,164
"Prince's Residence"

996
01:11:40,496 --> 01:11:41,360
Come

997
01:11:58,547 --> 01:12:00,515
Lord Yan arrives

998
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:13,260
Lord Yan, you're here to celebrate
Prince's birthday

999
01:12:13,362 --> 01:12:16,263
why bother to bring
so many guards with you?

1000
01:12:16,365 --> 01:12:17,332
Yes

1001
01:12:28,744 --> 01:12:32,202
You're here for the
Prince's birthday celebration

1002
01:12:32,314 --> 01:12:35,249
You bring guards and
dare not kneel to the Prince

1003
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:36,909
where are your manners?

1004
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:42,517
I apologize for not realising that

1005
01:12:42,624 --> 01:12:45,218
But I'm not here for this purpose

1006
01:12:45,327 --> 01:12:46,225
You're rude

1007
01:12:46,328 --> 01:12:48,922
Your Majesty, excuse me for being rude

1008
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:51,761
I am here today because
someone is suing Your Majesty

1009
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:55,530
for sheltering rebels, hiding stolen goods

1010
01:12:55,637 --> 01:12:56,626
How dare you!

1011
01:12:56,739 --> 01:13:00,334
Although I'm low in rank,
I've the order of the Emperor

1012
01:13:00,442 --> 01:13:03,741
Although Your Majesty is
highly respectable

1013
01:13:03,846 --> 01:13:05,973
treason cannot be taken lightly

1014
01:13:06,081 --> 01:13:08,743
You said you have the order of the Emperor

1015
01:13:08,851 --> 01:13:11,411
but I don't know who you are

1016
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:14,216
How can you prove yourself?

1017
01:13:14,323 --> 01:13:15,585
I have the seal

1018
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:17,283
where's the seal?

1019
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:22,095
Your Majesty seems to know
that I've lost my seal

1020
01:13:22,197 --> 01:13:24,631
Unfortunately, the one stolen
was a fake one

1021
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:25,290
Yu Mo

1022
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:26,493
Yes

1023
01:13:39,648 --> 01:13:43,140
It seems Yan is going to
arrest His Majesty, hurry...

1024
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:51,149
Master Lan, by the order of Master Shen

1025
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:52,852
Yan Chun Min is taking his men
to arrest His Majesty

1026
01:13:52,961 --> 01:13:54,087
There are people fighting in the hall

1027
01:13:54,196 --> 01:13:55,527
Master Shen told me to ask you

1028
01:13:55,631 --> 01:13:56,655
to take some men to help

1029
01:13:56,765 --> 01:13:57,789
Yes

1030
01:13:58,867 --> 01:14:01,199
Master Lan, what are we going to do?

1031
01:14:01,303 --> 01:14:03,100
Let's turn on the traps first

1032
01:14:49,785 --> 01:14:50,945
How cunning of Lan Xiao!

1033
01:14:51,053 --> 01:14:52,680
I suppose he'd be sent away
by Shen Zhong Yuan

1034
01:14:52,788 --> 01:14:55,951
not realising that he'd turn on
the traps before going

1035
01:14:59,127 --> 01:15:01,186
Don't blame me if you're dead

1036
01:15:08,036 --> 01:15:09,230
The trap is activated

1037
01:15:43,639 --> 01:15:45,129
Finally there's no need
to be left dangling anymore

1038
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:46,366
Brother Han

1039
01:15:46,475 --> 01:15:50,411
You must be Brother Zhi, the Black Fox

1040
01:15:54,449 --> 01:15:58,613
Alright... Yan Chun Min

1041
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:01,712
You said someone is suing me for treason

1042
01:16:01,823 --> 01:16:03,085
who's the plaintiff?

1043
01:16:03,191 --> 01:16:05,125
Of course there's someone

1044
01:16:05,527 --> 01:16:06,118
Bring Ai Fu

1045
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:07,286
Yes

1046
01:16:18,607 --> 01:16:20,234
So it's this Ai Fu

1047
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:23,243
who's he?

1048
01:16:23,345 --> 01:16:25,370
He's a servant at our residence

1049
01:16:27,115 --> 01:16:29,276
Servant suing the master

1050
01:16:29,384 --> 01:16:32,444
Yan Chun Min,
do you know the laws of our regime?

1051
01:16:32,554 --> 01:16:33,748
Of course I do

1052
01:16:33,855 --> 01:16:36,016
Your Majesty,
please have a look at Ai Fu's wounds

1053
01:16:36,124 --> 01:16:38,684
I have already flogged
and cross-examined him

1054
01:16:39,962 --> 01:16:40,758
Take this traitor away

1055
01:16:40,862 --> 01:16:42,056
Yes

1056
01:16:47,035 --> 01:16:48,525
Your Majesty wants to silent him?

1057
01:16:48,637 --> 01:16:50,332
Capture Yan Chun Min too

1058
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:51,497
Yes

1059
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:18,223
Hurry

1060
01:17:20,435 --> 01:17:23,131
There's a Copper Net upstairs,
it's terrible

1061
01:17:23,572 --> 01:17:26,564
It was said that brother Bai died there

1062
01:17:26,675 --> 01:17:28,142
That's correct

1063
01:17:28,543 --> 01:17:30,340
But just standing here won't help either

1064
01:17:30,445 --> 01:17:32,606
At least we have to try

1065
01:17:33,048 --> 01:17:34,106
That's correct

1066
01:17:36,551 --> 01:17:38,348
Then I have to hang in the air again

1067
01:17:38,453 --> 01:17:40,250
we may not be able to go upstairs

1068
01:17:40,355 --> 01:17:42,653
but do as I say and try

1069
01:17:42,758 --> 01:17:43,952
Alright

1070
01:17:47,596 --> 01:17:48,688
Come on

1071
01:18:38,246 --> 01:18:40,646
They are Master Xu, the Mountain Rat

1072
01:18:40,749 --> 01:18:42,512
and Master Jiang, the River Rat

1073
01:18:42,617 --> 01:18:43,879
That's us

1074
01:18:45,954 --> 01:18:47,046
It's Master Zhi

1075
01:18:47,155 --> 01:18:48,588
You're too kind, I am Zhi Hua

1076
01:18:48,690 --> 01:18:51,284
Hey, I'm still hanging in the air

1077
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:53,588
Brother, don't worry, I'm coming

1078
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:01,401
Go...

1079
01:19:02,871 --> 01:19:03,360
we're going too

1080
01:19:03,472 --> 01:19:05,064
Go...

1081
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:42,040
Shen Zhong Yuan, you are from the Kaifeng

1082
01:20:14,142 --> 01:20:15,040
Are you alright?

1083
01:20:15,143 --> 01:20:16,110
I'm fine

1084
01:20:17,012 --> 01:20:19,173
Be careful, there's...

1085
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:29,423
- Brother Xu
- 3rd brother

1086
01:20:29,524 --> 01:20:30,388
3rd brother

1087
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:31,720
Brother

1088
01:20:34,596 --> 01:20:36,894
It's my fault

1089
01:20:36,998 --> 01:20:41,162
I think brother Bai
would feel Ionely over there

1090
01:20:41,269 --> 01:20:43,760
I could keep him company

1091
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:46,601
Brother Xu

1092
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:48,141
- 3rd brother
- Brother Xu

1093
01:22:11,359 --> 01:22:12,883
3rd brother

1094
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:22,870
If only Big Brother could be here earlier

1095
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:27,597
This is Zhi Hua, our Big Brother

1096
01:22:27,709 --> 01:22:29,643
Brother Lu, we've met before

1097
01:22:29,744 --> 01:22:30,802
Brother Zhi

1098
01:22:34,749 --> 01:22:36,080
The Prince of Xiang Yang

1099
01:22:36,184 --> 01:22:38,243
has hidden all the treasures in here

1100
01:22:38,353 --> 01:22:40,480
the Jade Horse,
Pearl Crown are all in there

1101
01:22:40,889 --> 01:22:42,322
How are we going to take them out?

1102
01:22:42,424 --> 01:22:43,914
They are controlled by traps

1103
01:22:44,025 --> 01:22:46,721
Although Lan Xiao was sent away
by Shen Zhong Yuan

1104
01:22:46,828 --> 01:22:48,523
he turned on the traps before he left

1105
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:51,190
The switches don't work here

1106
01:22:51,299 --> 01:22:53,199
The key is with Lan Xiao

1107
01:22:53,768 --> 01:22:56,066
Then we can't take it

1108
01:22:56,171 --> 01:22:58,105
I've made some preparations

1109
01:23:46,654 --> 01:23:48,485
This seal is a fake one, it's useless

1110
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,427
This is the Dragon Pearl Crown

1111
01:24:06,841 --> 01:24:08,240
This is the Jade Horse

1112
01:24:14,315 --> 01:24:15,873
what's in this box?

1113
01:24:15,984 --> 01:24:17,178
This...

1114
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:20,014
It used to contain the list of the names

1115
01:24:20,121 --> 01:24:22,282
but now it has disappeared

1116
01:24:23,992 --> 01:24:26,517
The list is
the most important thing of all

1117
01:24:27,028 --> 01:24:31,021
Brother Zhi, where else could it be?

1118
01:24:33,668 --> 01:24:35,829
You'd have to ask the Prince,
I really don't know

1119
01:24:35,937 --> 01:24:37,461
Prince of Xiang Yang is in the hall

1120
01:24:37,572 --> 01:24:39,870
Although Lord Yan has brought a lot of men

1121
01:24:39,974 --> 01:24:41,441
Not to mention Hua Chong, Deng Che

1122
01:24:41,543 --> 01:24:43,408
Even with those guards,
they can't resist them

1123
01:24:43,511 --> 01:24:45,103
Let's get back quick

1124
01:25:18,713 --> 01:25:20,305
2nd brother, protect His Lordship

1125
01:27:34,215 --> 01:27:35,842
The list is not at the House of Traps

1126
01:27:45,393 --> 01:27:48,453
Your Majesty,
the list is not in the House of Traps

1127
01:27:49,964 --> 01:27:52,023
So what?

1128
01:27:52,133 --> 01:27:54,931
You should realise
that you have lost your power

1129
01:27:55,036 --> 01:27:56,594
Hand over the list

1130
01:27:56,704 --> 01:27:59,332
His Majesty might spare your life

1131
01:27:59,907 --> 01:28:03,866
Everyone outside is
fighting for their master

1132
01:28:03,978 --> 01:28:06,640
I can't blame them, but you,
who I have treated so well

1133
01:28:06,748 --> 01:28:09,842
turned into a traitor

1134
01:28:09,951 --> 01:28:13,045
and is now putting pressure on me

1135
01:28:36,544 --> 01:28:38,341
Your Majesty, did you hear that?

1136
01:28:38,446 --> 01:28:40,243
Hua Chong and Deng Che are dead

1137
01:28:40,348 --> 01:28:42,179
You'd better hand over the list

1138
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:49,018
Alright, I'll help you fulfil
your career aspirations

1139
01:29:08,309 --> 01:29:09,367
Take it

1140
01:29:25,593 --> 01:29:30,292
Father, please forgive my incompetence

1141
01:29:30,398 --> 01:29:32,696
I can only follow your footsteps to death

1142
01:29:44,645 --> 01:29:48,308
Prince of Xiang Yang
committed suicide, here's the list

1143
01:29:59,727 --> 01:30:01,160
The list is in my stomach

1144
01:30:01,262 --> 01:30:03,753
Cut me up and take it

1145
01:30:03,865 --> 01:30:05,423
Then I'll cut you up

1146
01:30:13,207 --> 01:30:14,299
You can get the list

1147
01:30:14,409 --> 01:30:16,343
but why did you let Hua Chong grab it?

1148
01:30:16,444 --> 01:30:18,139
Once Prince of Xiang Yang is dead,
his power is gone

1149
01:30:18,246 --> 01:30:20,544
This list will cause the death of many

1150
01:30:20,648 --> 01:30:22,081
what do you want it for?

1151
01:30:27,054 --> 01:30:29,454
Fame and riches bring disasters to many

1152
01:30:29,557 --> 01:30:31,650
These people used to live comfortably
in the Island

1153
01:30:31,759 --> 01:30:34,091
now they end up like this

1154
01:30:34,195 --> 01:30:36,322
I'm afraid the list can never be found
