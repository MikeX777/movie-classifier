1
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,680
Good morning.

2
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,920
TALKS WITH T.G. MASARYK

00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:25,670

4
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,960
Good morning, Mr. President.

5
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,040
Morning is long gone.

6
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,000
- Tea ?
- Thank you.

7
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,280
Are you worried ?

8
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,200
I didn't know you liked
this kind of music.

9
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,040
Me neither.

10
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,120
Yes. I am worried. About Olga.

11
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,840
- That actress ?
- She's not "that actress"...

12
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,000
I am sorry.
What's wrong with her ?

13
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,280
She and Dr. Steinbach, whom
you know, made a trip to Zbraslav.

14
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,320
- They were driving too fast.
- And she was driving...

15
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,240
Yes, she was, apparently
overestimating her abilities.

16
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,000
Is she hurt ?

17
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,600
No concussion, but the wound on her
head took really long to stitch.

18
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,680
Unfortunately,
I have to leave today.

19
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,160
- Of course.
- I am sorry.

20
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:58,800
Although Dr. Steinbach is with her now
and apparently also some other man...

21
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,280
But, I have to go.

22
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,040
How did you like the film yesterday ?

23
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,200
Metropolis ! Remarkable !

24
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,440
Artificial people, robots...
You like that, don't you ?

25
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:24,600
Yes, I like that. I like the topic
of a man vs his creation.

26
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,840
A man's creation revolt.

27
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,360
Like Adam and Eve
against God in paradise ?

28
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,480
Yes. Like that.

29
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:39,240
Čapek, do you make up your plays
or are they based on truth ?

30
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,080
- You like that revolt, don't you ?
- It depends.

31
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,240
I find revolt important.

32
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,640
You can't stop people
discovering things.

33
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,040
But we can't foresee
where it will lead.

34
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,680
Like Adam and Eve couldn't.

35
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,520
I apologise,
but I'll have to go soon.

36
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,680
- What time does the train depart ?
- 12:21.

37
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,520
I really need to discuss
some points of our book.

38
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,920
You are not yet happy with the text.

39
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,520
I do value the comments
of your family and friends,

40
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,640
but we must finalize the whole
process, provide the final version.

41
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,520
Have you read the papers ?
I didn't manage.

42
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,000
- You mean politics ?
- No, I don't.

43
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,120
Yes, I did.

44
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,840
I took some notes.

45
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,800
A man appeared in the court in Martin.

46
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,120
His young wife cheated on him.
He killed her with an axe.

47
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,880
At the court he said he'd do it again.
He was sentenced to death.

48
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,400
Have you loved someone so much
that you could kill ?

49
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,680
I don't know.

50
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,480
The papers publish the lists of people

51
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,200
who will be pardoned at the occasion
of the Republic's anniversary.

52
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,920
- How many ?
- 20, 30 names a day.

53
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,800
Altogether many.

54
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,880
What would you do if that murderer
asked you for the pardon ?

55
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,800
I have no idea.

56
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,480
Try to imagine.

57
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,160
It's hard. I don't know !

58
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,000
Anything else in the papers ?

59
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,440
Your statues unveiled everywhere.

60
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,120
Rolínek's one in Kunštát
is 15 m tall.

61
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:52,200
- I shall grant him that pardon.
- The French paper is even poetic:

62
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:57,200
The age of this President Liberator
is like a beautiful evening...

63
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:04,200
It takes me longer to decide than
him to kill, but I know I'll do it.

64
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,400
At night I had an idea
in connection with the anniversary.

65
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,160
We need 50 years
of undisturbed growth

66
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,160
to get where we wish
to be already today,

67
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,280
then we won't have to be afraid
of anything and anybody.

68
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,600
With our geographical position,
it won't be easy.

69
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:40,120
I promised that the new division
of Central Europe will bring peace.

70
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,640
That all the hatred, reinforced
by the war, will disappear.

71
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,160
But instead, it became even deeper.

72
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,640
Germans, Austrians,
Hungarians and even Poles

73
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,840
hate us more than before 1918.

74
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:01,920
The Great Powers wanted cooperation.
But instead, all those small states

75
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,840
introduced protectionist policies
and grew more chauvinistic.

76
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,480
We have cut the bonds
with the Austrian monarchy,

77
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:16,160
but haven't established any new
economic order in Central Europe.

78
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,520
- Are you afraid of Germans, Čapek ?
- Aren't you ?

79
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:27,800
Germans have a slogan:
We don't fear anyone except God.

80
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,760
- Exactly.
- But I like it.

81
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,360
It's good to have a self-confident
and strong neighbour.

82
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,800
If they are strong,
we must be strong too.

83
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,960
In such a partnership of strength
it's easier to communicate.

84
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:46,760
With an insecure and unclear
weakling, you won't go far.

85
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,880
My grandchildren,
Olga's sons, left it here.

86
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,680
I suspected it was yours.

87
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:06,080
I know the German issue
is the key one for the Republic.

88
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,960
As a state, we don't really
have any other issue.

89
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:15,120
But you can never rebuild
Germans into Czechs.

90
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,960
You can rebuild them
into Czechoslovaks.

91
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,560
Let them speak their own
language and add the freedom.

92
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,040
If the freedom is better than
what they have, you win.

93
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,440
I don't want to fight with them
or anyone else about a nationality.

94
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,320
What I offer is freedom
and social justice.

95
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,520
And what if they wouldn't
care for it ?

96
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,840
It's me who decides here, Čapek.
It doesn't depend on them !

97
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:48,520
You know me. I am not just
an idealist. I know politics.

98
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,840
When the southern states
wanted to break away,

99
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:00,760
Washington didn't let them
and it ended as the Civil war.

100
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:05,000
If our Germans would want to break
away we wouldn't let them either.

101
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,400
We won't let them destroy
our homeland.

102
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,640
But until then,

103
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,720
we have to do our best
to make them feel at home here.

104
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,280
- And if they wouldn't want ?
- Then a war will be the only solution.

105
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,120
That's the problem.
Wells once told me in London:

106
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,880
- You can't cast them out.
- That's true.

107
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:33,600
Germans will never accept their defeat,
or the existence of our republic.

108
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,760
They still have many young men
excited by weapons.

109
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,640
It is the most militant nation
in Europe.

110
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,880
- We have defeated them in the war.
- That's what they don't respect.

111
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,680
They say: you Czechs haven't fought
a single fight with us.

112
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:54,360
You've never defeated us and have
no right control us after the war.

113
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,440
Victory, defeat...

114
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,320
I want to suggest something to you,
Mr. President.

115
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:10,080
We are at the end of the book,
after a year of work,

116
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,120
and I consider it to be
your book as much as mine.

117
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,920
So I suggest
to divide the fee fifty-fifty.

118
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,080
My God, Čapek. You wrote it,
I just supplied the material.

119
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,520
But nobody has ever got
such a material.

120
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,280
Fifty-fifty ? Agreed ? Otherwise this
job won't bring me any satisfaction.

121
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,000
I never push on you.
But I do now.

122
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,880
Promise me you'll think it over.

123
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:46,240
-Have the book cost you a lot of work ?
- Yes, but I am used to work.

124
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,320
Work brings both victories
and failures.

125
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,880
- You should be able to take both.
- Sure.

126
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,800
Then this one is a failure.

127
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,080
Well...

128
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,200
- The book won't be published.
- I beg your pardon ?

129
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,560
I didn't know how to tell you,

130
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:12,440
but I decided already yesterday.

131
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,400
It can't be published.

132
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:23,000
Alice, my daughter insists on it,
Jan and many other think the same.

133
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:27,640
- They say it is inappropriate.
- Inappropriate ? How ?

134
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:33,280
Mostly because of the chapter
about love and marriage.

135
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,960
It's not right for a president
to speak about women.

136
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,600
About love between
a man and a woman.

137
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,280
But you are a human, not a monster.

138
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,240
I do not agree with them.
I think the opposite.

139
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:56,280
You wrote much less, than
what I told you and what I think...

140
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,120
Anyhow, it mustn't be published.

141
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,440
It's a lost deal.

142
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,800
How many times did you have
to rewrite it ? Ten ? Hundred ?

143
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,800
You wanted to make a name on it.

144
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:30,160
With all due respect, Mr. President,
that book was your idea.

145
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,320
I don't think I deserve
to be treated like this.

146
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,400
And we can also always cancel
that chapter.

147
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,360
Oh, cancel... the chapter.

148
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,320
Let's go for a walk.

149
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,800
I like the grassfield in autumn.

150
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,720
Everybody thinks it's dying,
but it's full of life.

151
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,680
As a boy I fed a goat henbane.

152
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,200
- It died.
- Henbane is poisonous.

153
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:49,640
As an educated city man you know that,
but I was just a village rascal.

154
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:56,200
Each flower is different, but they all
need loving care, just like people.

155
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,560
- I never had time for such things.
- Sorry, Mr. President.

156
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,400
Centaurium erythraea,
a very rare herb.

157
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,920
Easily overlooked and
great for your gallbladder.

158
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,680
Čapek...

159
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,680
- You have a better sight...
- It's your son.

160
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,760
Our Jan...
the London ambassador.

161
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,080
He stayed long
at the bonfire yesterday.

162
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,400
Probably has some sweetheart
in the village.

163
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:47,960
Jan is not sure about your book,
but it's Alice who dislikes it most.

164
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,680
She is very strict. After me.

165
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:58,560
A firstborn,
she always wanted to be like me.

166
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,760
Look at this !

167
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,840
Can you tell which one is mine ?

168
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,760
This one ?

169
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,280
Wrong ! It's hers.

170
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:19,840
- I mistook it in the morning too.
- How did you find out ?

171
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,480
How ?

172
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,040
You see ?
That's how I found out.

173
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:39,360
She couldn't take the fact she'd
never be a professor of philosophy.

174
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:46,360
Wearing her heart on her sleeve.
Charlie brought her up that way.

175
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,720
They both thought it would do.

176
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,480
She made it hard for herself.

177
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,240
If she was to write, then about
nothing less important than God.

178
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,640
But after ten sentences
she had nothing more to say.

179
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,840
She asked me:
How is it possible, dad ?

180
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,680
After all,
I am yours and mom's daughter.

181
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,200
Finally she gave up and started
to worry about her looks... Her !

182
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,120
She was ashamed to wear glasses

183
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,760
but couldn't recognize
people on the street.

184
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:23,680
I used to tell her, sweetheart,
beauty is an inner light.

185
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,200
But she is a woman.
She didn't believe me.

186
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,960
With her mom we though: She'd
get married and all would change.

187
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,400
She never has.

188
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,440
I taught her to value her freedom.
For her, men ceased to exist.

189
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,880
She doesn't mean it like that, Čapek.

190
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,440
She's terrible. Isn't she ?

191
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,560
- Tell me !
- Yes, she is terrible.

192
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,560
We, Masaryks, are terrible.

193
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,240
It's not easy for me
with her either, believe me !

194
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,520
She wants to be my conscience.

195
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:15,440
I oppose: You don't have to
safeguard my legacy, my dear.

196
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,600
- I am still alive !
- But I am alive too, Mr. President.

197
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,200
What if the book is better
than she can understand ?

198
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,000
What are you scribbling there ?

199
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,560
As I said, it's all over.

200
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,760
- Are you working on a new book ?
- Detective stories.

201
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:56,000
Maybe not really detective...

202
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,240
An offender is not important here.

203
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:05,560
What is important are the people
and their hidden beliefs.

204
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,960
- Do you enjoy writing ?
- I learnt to enjoy it.

205
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:15,200
Others are in pain when writing.
It hurts me too sometimes.

206
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,480
But I don't mind.

207
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,680
If you want to be a writer,
you have to write more than you live.

208
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,360
Like let's say at a hot summer day,
people are sunbathing at a lake

209
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,360
and me, sitting at home
with my feet in a washtub,

210
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,800
writing a story about
people sunbathing at a lake.

211
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,440
Not many people have dreamt up
so many beautiful lives as I have.

212
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,200
But once in a blue moon
a miracle happens.

213
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,520
You feel something
has got inside you.

214
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,520
It's like a vertigo.

215
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,440
A feeling that I don't control it.
That something is writing through me.

216
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,200
I've never enjoyed writing.

217
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,640
When I needed to say something
I sat down and wrote.

218
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,960
But I always wanted to get over
it as soon as possible.

219
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,480
Nobody would ever dare to say
my books are poor though.

220
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,840
Only Suicide was good.

221
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,800
I think it's a masterpiece.

222
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,200
Timeless.

223
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,800
Have you ever wanted
to take your own life ?

224
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,880
I don't think so... No.

225
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,240
Didn't you want to die
when you were young ?

226
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,680
When I was young,
I felt older than ever.

227
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,720
I think a young man is dull.

228
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,520
Unable to imagine,
that one day he will be dead.

229
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,560
Always waiting for something.

230
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,080
- For the world to change by itself.
- Haven't you even try to imagine ?

231
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,600
What would it be like ?
By your own hand...

232
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,280
- Yes, I have.
- You see ?

233
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,840
Let's say, because of a woman ?

234
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,480
Four years ago,
when my mother was dying...

235
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,120
A student of mine
shot himself in mouth.

236
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,920
His name was Flesch.
He left me some money.

237
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,920
- I talked about him before.
- Yes.

238
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,240
I saw his body at pathology.

239
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,800
No blood on his face,
nothing to be seen.

240
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,360
But his expression...

241
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,000
I expected the horror of someone

242
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,800
who lost faith
and fell into desperation.

243
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,280
But he was smiling.

244
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:10,800
When he was taking his own life,
without God, he was smiling.

245
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,800
- Do you understand that ?
- I think I do.

246
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,280
- Smile !
- Pardon me ?

247
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,520
Smile !

248
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,320
No !

249
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,640
Nobody can smile like he did
at that moment.

250
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:33,560
- What are you thinking about ?
- Do you really want to know ?

251
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,200
First:
Borový is planning the campaign.

252
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,040
Second:
the ads for the papers are ready.

253
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:44,400
And third: our book is a gift
to the Republic's decennary.

254
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,360
That's what I am thinking about.

255
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:53,960
You were sick when you were young.
You told me about it but I forgot.

256
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:58,440
Scarlet fever ate my spine away.
My back is made of stone.

257
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:03,960
My father, a doctor,
told me I would die soon.

258
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:11,480
I had a girlfriend I loved. I didn't
marry her, not to destroy her life.

259
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:17,080
After two years
doctors told me I shall live.

260
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,720
Your girlfriend must have been happy.

261
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,400
She got married in the meantime.
I think she is happy...

262
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,160
Suicide ?

263
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,800
I couldn't think of it now.

264
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,960
If only because of my mother...

265
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:48,400
The pain taught me to live for work.
We must live whatever happens.

266
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,280
It also taught me

267
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,920
that what matters
is what you do for the others.

268
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,400
- That's a clever opinion.
- It's true.

269
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:05,080
You live among the characters you
made up yourself. Not real people.

270
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,840
I think you are real enough.

271
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,640
No. You made me up too.

272
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,840
How old were you, Čapek,
when you left home ?

273
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,200
Eleven. When I was sent
to a high school in Hradec.

274
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,600
I was 14.

275
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:42,240
I found out I could earn my living
and stopped snooping on the rich.

276
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:48,480
- But you graduated in philosophy !
- Really just graduated...

277
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,040
You never wanted to make
money with it ?

278
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:56,560
I did but I didn't get habilitation.
I couldn't teach.

279
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,280
What time is it, Čapek ?

280
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,000
Five to eleven.

281
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:12,680
You are a philosopher like me.
And I am a journalist like you.

282
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:17,440
I always preferred writing newspaper
articles to preparing my lectures.

283
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,960
I like to encounter new things

284
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,360
and discuss them
with all people at once.

285
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:31,720
Newspapers is the best way
how to share things quickly.

286
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,880
I am not sure.

287
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,920
People want a journalist
to write things long known.

288
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,840
Only few people want to learn
about new things.

289
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,520
The rest prefer to just reconfirm
old things.

290
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:52,520
Radiojournal station
broadcasting continues

291
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:57,360
with the news of
Czechoslovak press agency.

292
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,240
Ministry of justice prepared

293
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:08,000
a concept of amnesty at the occasion
of the Republic's decennary...

294
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,880
Ten years. Time flies.

295
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,000
- How are you going to celebrate ?
- I don't celebrate 28 October.

296
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,680
We founded the Republic
two weeks earlier abroad,

297
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:40,080
when the Great Powers approved
our temporary government.

298
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,880
That was important ! Not what
the crowds in Prague were doing.

299
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,240
Beneš and me will also meet
at Lány two weeks earlier.

300
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,400
At a small dinner party.

301
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,880
That's all.

302
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,280
Čapek, may I ask you ?

303
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,200
I'll never be able to explain this
to all those Prague "October men".

304
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:17,320
Rašín was the worst, thinking the
Republic existed only thanks to him.

305
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,520
Thanks to the first
Republic's act he had compiled

306
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:25,040
and the brass band he had sent
to the streets for people to stay calm.

307
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:30,680
Without our resistance abroad, he'd
be sent back to prison the same day.

308
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:35,000
Švehla was the only
real man among them.

309
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,720
But he had a terrible life style:
sleeping at day, working at night.

310
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:48,520
And all the booze and cigars.

311
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,720
He also paid for it soon enough.

312
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,640
Rašín: the dictator.

313
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,880
He didn't like people.

314
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,000
If he wasn't assassinated,

315
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,920
he'd become a friend of
Mussolini and Czech fascists.

316
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,640
And Stříbrný:
womanizer and drunkard,

317
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,280
totally unable to control himself.

318
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,760
Soukup: a decent man,

319
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,520
but he'd bore you to death
in 5 minutes.

320
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:38,000
And Šrobár, for Slovaks ! In 1918,
they had no politics of their own yet.

321
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,760
They always just sent someone to Prague
to speak for all of them at once !

322
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,720
Terrible.

323
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:50,600
And what did you do in 1918, Čapek ?

324
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,160
I was in Národní listy.

325
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:58,320
I knew Beneš already before the war.
He was my teacher at the university.

326
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:04,680
Beneš was our core person abroad.
I was the brains, Beneš was the sward.

327
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:10,200
Nobody at German's side had worked
so hard during the war as he had.

328
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:16,480
- Have you ever distrusted him ?
- You know I doubt everything.

329
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:21,400
Of course I have. We don't live
in paradise. We live on Earth.

330
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,440
But I knew Beneš as a man,

331
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:31,400
who became one
with the fate of this country.

332
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,120
Still it's unbelievable.

333
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:43,880
In 1915, before Beneš joined you
in dismantling Austria

334
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,360
I was going to Spain.
He found out somehow and asked me

335
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,960
to take some documents with me.
Maybe they were for you.

336
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,320
Many people were delivering
messages back and forth.

337
00:29:54,400 --> 00:30:00,160
Two of you had achieved so much.
With Štefánik and few others.

338
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:04,720
I can't think of another place where
the few like you accomplished so much.

339
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,080
You see and maybe
we could do even more.

340
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,200
- Do you think so ?
- You always can do more.

341
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,320
Čapek !

342
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,880
I'll tell you something
I haven't said to anyone else.

343
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:25,560
When I can't sleep at night
and my eyes get too tired to read,

344
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,520
I often think about one thing.

345
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,280
I never regret anything,

346
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:39,000
but maybe back in 1917 in Russia
I made a mistake.

347
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:45,400
I had 20 thousand fully armed men,
which was quite a lot for that time.

348
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:51,920
Maybe I should have rather moved
against Moscow or St Petersburg.

349
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:59,720
Those days I believed we shouldn't
meddle in Russian affairs at any price.

350
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,560
But if I'd had meddled,
Russia might be different today.

351
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,400
As a democrat
you didn't have a choice.

352
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,840
Yes I did.

353
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,960
I didn't return from America
as a democrat back in 1918,

354
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,600
or even as a democratic president.

355
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,760
I had no idea I was going
to be elected.

356
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,520
When I got the telegram,
I was stunned.

357
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,680
I was returning as a dictator.

358
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:33,760
Nobody, including me, thought
the monarchy would capitulate so soon.

359
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:39,120
We were sure French will have
to move all the way to Berlin

360
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,960
to pay Germans back
for the defeat at Sedan.

361
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:48,160
We agreed I'd move with them
in the head of the legions.

362
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,840
Berlin then Dresden and Prague.

363
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:55,080
I wanted to win
our Prague back from Germans.

364
00:31:55,160 --> 00:32:00,400
Sorry to interrupt you but it's
going to rain. A storm is coming.

365
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,000
Oh, Čapek. Let's go then.

366
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,760
Someone passed away.

367
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,200
- Do you know why I left Catholics ?
- No, I don't know.

368
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,040
Their religion never changes.

369
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:57,080
While Protestantism
is a continuous reform.

370
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,320
- Catholic God doesn't change.
- Exactly ! And that's wrong.

371
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:09,440
When the whole world and universe
is on move, the God should move too.

372
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:15,200
It's logical. God can't separate
himself from his own creation.

373
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:21,640
Be careful not to reform
that God of yours to death !

374
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,080
Finally you'll find out
there is no God anymore.

375
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,080
That can happen.

376
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:31,640
- Aren't you a bit of disbeliever ?
- No, I am not.

377
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,520
Conscience or God,
it's the same thing.

378
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,200
11:20. Time flies.

379
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:20,880
Isn't it strange ? Two Czechs like us,
here, in an almost strange land

380
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:26,240
just 10 years after the war...
and it feels we've ever been here.

381
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:32,680
My father would never believe
it would be all ours one day.

382
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:38,720
Be careful, Čapek.
I am no Czech. I'm Slovak.

383
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:44,320
You know, a Moravian Slovak !
A Czechoslovak really !

384
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:50,000
You're right. I meant the
Czechoslovak nation. All the people.

385
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:54,120
Like the American nation consists
of all the people of America.

386
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:58,880
We Czechs in Prague think that as
the state was formed mainly there,

387
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,800
it will be always like that.
It will somehow belong to us.

388
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,120
I think you are
the main winner of the war.

389
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,080
It was you who said to the Allies:

390
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,960
"A chain of new democratic states
will emerge in Central Europe,

391
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:22,240
better ones than the old empires.
And that's the sense of the war."

392
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,880
- That's true.
- It's great.

393
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,800
Except Czechoslovakia, no other
democracies were founded, though.

394
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,800
But such tendency
was established.

395
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,840
You also tasked
the Great Powers

396
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:36,720
to watch Germany not to become
too strong again after the war.

397
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,840
- True.
- They didn't listen.

398
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,800
But that's the deal.
What do you expect ?

399
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:47,600
If a small nation and state
wants to win, it has to bet a lot.

400
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,200
- Germans are not weak anymore.
- They're still manageable.

401
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,880
Your prediction of global revolution
of heads and hearts hasn't come true.

402
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:02,440
- Except for maybe here.
- 1918 brought a new space.

403
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,520
It would have been cowardly
not to use the chance back then.

404
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:10,000
But your calculation had
too many variables, I think.

405
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,480
Too many strange wills
hard to influence altogether.

406
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:17,160
All my life I've influenced
people in the same way.

407
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:22,960
I offer them my thoughts. Explain where
they come from. And discuss them.

408
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,280
Before the war, not many
discussed with you here.

409
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,600
- What if it happens again ?
- Don't panic !

410
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,440
When the war started, it was
much harder than today, in 1928.

411
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,600
You're right. You wanted us to be
something like another Switzerland.

412
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,240
A great idea,
but it hasn't happened yet.

413
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,800
But it's also in progress !
Who are the Swiss ?

414
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:49,120
Germans, French and Italians,
living outside their motherlands.

415
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,160
They are doing better in Switzerland
than they would with their own nations.

416
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,360
And the Germans here would
eventually feel exactly the same.

417
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,600
I wish you were right.
It's a beautiful music of the future.

418
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,720
But I am talking about future.

419
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:22,040
- Čapek !
- Thank you very much. Nice.

420
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,880
I like this.

421
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,080
- What ?
- To have more options.

422
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,600
I like to find myself on the crossroads
suddenly not knowing which way to go.

423
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:45,560
When the brains starts to fall short.
Because it encounters the unknown.

424
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,480
It's almost a sort of anxiety.

425
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,000
A light blue pain.

426
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,760
- And what can you do about it ?
- Sorry ?

427
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,800
That anxiety, the pain.

428
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,960
To get rid of it and to find the way ?

429
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:12,240
By feeling pain, yours or someone
else's, you're already doing something.

430
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:18,360
Maybe more than someone
comfortably snuggled down in a bed.

431
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,240
So the pain doesn't disappear ?

432
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,040
Sometimes it doesn't.

433
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,880
A pain is senseless.
It should disappear.

434
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,320
- Take your shoes off, Čapek.
- Pardon me ?

435
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,120
We'll walk barefoot.

436
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,480
The grass is wet,
it will be pleasant.

437
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,520
Very pleasant...

438
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,200
Well...

439
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,960
What was the family name
of your girlfriend Olga again ?

440
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,120
Scheinpflugová...

441
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,920
Do you love her ?

442
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,800
I had loved Charlie for 45 years.
You didn't know her.

443
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,600
I think I understand
how much she had meant for you.

444
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:56,400
Nobody can understand that.
I didn't either before.

445
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:01,320
That a man and a woman
can share everything.

446
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,960
Talk about everything,
do everything.

447
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,360
Think as one, not two people.

448
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,000
My parents weren't like that.

449
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:18,080
My mom was much better
and stronger than my dad.

450
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,600
He was no match for her.
He was just a coachman.

451
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:26,160
She, as a servant, stood much higher.

452
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,760
When he asked authorities
to let me study in Brno,

453
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:35,080
he squeezed his hat.

454
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:41,200
I stood next to him watching his palms
sweating and I hated him for that.

455
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,760
He cursed at the rich at home

456
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:49,400
but took his hat off to them.

457
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,600
I said I'd never be like that.

458
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:05,440
A lonely man can't be strong.
Many people thing they'd manage.

459
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,720
But I know what I am talking about.

460
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,480
Solitude is crazy.

461
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:20,640
When you're lonely, you can't tell
whether you haven't got crazy yet.

462
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:27,120
All the hermits searching God in desert
eventually got crazy in their solitude.

463
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,480
Charlie was different.

464
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,280
She was very balanced.

465
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,920
I've never met a person
like her before, moreover a woman.

466
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:51,360
I was sure to end up as a bachelor,
absorbed by science and books.

467
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,000
Charlie calmed me down.

468
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,880
She gave me balance.

469
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,400
With her, I could keep my freedom.

470
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:07,000
For the first time, I met a woman,
who treated me as equal.

471
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:14,560
We have it in our book.
Or rather... we had.

472
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,920
You can't put it in any book.

473
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:27,120
I saved her friend from drowning,
almost drowning myself.

474
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:32,400
Guess what she told me,
when I was revived.

475
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,720
"Don't think I shall admire you.

476
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:40,880
Every decent man would do the same."

477
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,960
Did I tell you

478
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:50,480
what were her last words
before passing away ?

479
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:54,240
No, I haven't told anyone.

480
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,840
Ever.

481
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,080
She said:

482
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,920
"You've never surrendered. Good."

483
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:15,960
And then: "You'll never be alone.

484
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,880
I'll always be...

485
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:32,240
I'll always be with you."

486
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,400
That's beautiful.

487
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,040
Mr. President,

488
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,280
let's publish it.

489
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,560
- And what ?
- Our book.

490
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,360
Oh, Čapek...

491
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,920
- Why didn't you go to see Olga ?
- I told you ! I was going very soon !

492
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,760
Why didn't' t you go immediately ?
I would, if I were you.

493
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:16,680
You must worry her love for you
is crumbling, son !

494
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:22,520
If you don't go now,
you can publish 50 books

495
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:28,040
and she'll still find another man,
even with the wound on her head.

496
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,080
Čapek, wait !

497
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,560
Čapek !

498
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,840
Come on.

499
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:04,280
You decide, just like that, there'll
be no book, wasting a year of my work.

500
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:08,760
You don't care about the other
person's feelings, worries,

501
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:14,000
people are looking forward
to the book. It will be a shame.

502
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,440
Tell me more about your Olga.

503
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,840
Olga...

504
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:31,200
- Olga is complicated.
- I thought you liked it.

505
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,560
Oh, come on.

506
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:38,880
She gets marriage proposals,
doesn't she ?

507
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,280
Yes...

508
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,200
Time to time.

509
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,760
Some Frenchman wanted
to marry her, she wanted too.

510
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:55,480
So I wished her luck.
But she swallowed some pills.

511
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:59,200
Since then we are just good friends.

512
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:08,800
I am not a theatre expert like you.
Actors have always scared me.

513
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:13,720
If an actor was good,
I believed him in his role.

514
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,760
But it was a shock to find out

515
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:20,480
that as a human being
he was completely different.

516
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,680
I hated the idea, you couldn't tell
who is who, if an actor was good.

517
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:27,240
What was a poem and what was life.

518
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:31,800
If an actor is good
the truth is on the stage, I'd say.

519
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:36,840
Is Olga a good actress ?

520
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:43,240
How did you meet her ?

521
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:50,480
When did you realize,
it was the woman of your life ?

522
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,960
That came later.

523
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:00,400
I first met her after a show,
waiting in front of the theatre.

524
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:05,920
She wore that paper dress. Remember ?
They were in fashion after the war.

525
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,040
She was 17.

526
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:15,800
I said to her:
"I need your voice, young lady."

527
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,760
Her voice ?

528
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:22,520
I wanted to hear how my Mimi
would sound in The Bandit.

529
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,040
And ?
Would you like to marry her ?

530
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:33,200
First I wanted, then I didn't
and now I don't know what I want.

531
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,760
I don't know.

532
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:41,920
- Čapek !
- Now Dr. Steinbach is with her.

533
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,800
He takes care of her,
when she needs help.

534
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:49,000
And I am here with you
to hear you don't need my help.

535
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,720
You'll go now to see her
and settle things in Prague.

536
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,840
So you won't let me publish
that book ?

537
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,600
No.

538
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:17,680
You always blame me of asking you
too ordinary questions.

539
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,040
And don't you agree ?

540
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,360
Okay then.

541
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,160
How about your mother ?

542
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,640
How did you feel,
when people told you

543
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:36,240
she didn't have you with your father ?
With the coachman ?

544
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:44,200
My mother... I loved her.

545
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:53,480
How did you feel when papers wrote
you were a bastard ?

546
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:57,720
What did you think of her ?

547
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,920
Be careful, Čapek !

548
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:10,320
As I said, I was ashamed
of my dad for his humility.

549
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:16,680
But my mother was a different story.

550
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:19,520
What did you think of her ?

551
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,960
Dear friend,

552
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,520
I've noticed long ago how much
you'd like to be my son.

553
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,680
- I beg your pardon ?
- But I've got one already.

554
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,040
All the servility of yours
from the beginning...

555
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:37,920
"Please, Mr. President,
change my questions as you wish !"

556
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:43,200
Mr. Čapek lets Mr. Masaryk
ask his own questions !

557
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:46,640
I wanted to serve you,
that's true... But you liked it !

558
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:51,560
"Please, Mr. President, find a task
for me, something I could do for you !"

559
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,960
A real man knows
what his task is !

560
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:58,160
I wished to be useful for the Republic.
I just asked you how to do it !

561
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,680
You didn't want to serve the state,
you wanted to serve me !

562
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:06,440
And you liked it. I am sorry
for you. You are so lonely.

563
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,840
- Pardon me ?
- You are alone.

564
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,600
Unlike you, I have a family.

565
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:18,360
But they have no time for you.
And either do you for them !

566
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:22,880
You even left your beloved Charlie !
At the beginning of the war !

567
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,120
When you went to the exile
to build this state.

568
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:29,440
You left your wife and children
here ! And off you went.

569
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:49,360
I had two important things in life:

570
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:54,040
my family and my work.

571
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:59,680
When I had to chose one,
it took me this to decide...

572
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:04,640
I owe them for that till today.

573
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:09,560
Mainly to my dear late Charlotte.

574
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:14,520
Also to Eliška,
she pays for it till today.

575
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,600
I destroyed her somehow.

576
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:25,160
She's only known duty
in her life, no joy.

577
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,800
And it's my fault.

578
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:32,400
And I owe to our late Herbert too.

579
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:36,920
And Jan, who tries
to find himself all his life.

580
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,600
I wish he did one day.

581
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:44,760
And to the youngest, Olga,
who joined me to the exile

582
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:47,560
and almost got crazy

583
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:53,200
from the amount of work
she had to do for me.

584
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,680
And now, you too, Čapek.

585
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,800
Can't you forgive me at least ?

586
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:13,680
- Did you fight as a boy ?
- No, I didn't.

587
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:18,920
I did. In a bunch or alone,
it didn't matter.

588
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,640
Alone against everybody.

589
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:28,960
People in the crowd will never know
how great it is to get a thrashing.

590
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,280
Alone. When you are right.

591
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:35,720
Not everybody can take what you can.

592
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:41,280
People have no idea
what they can take.

593
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:46,760
But when you bend them, you find out
they can take really a lot.

594
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:52,680
I didn't know this
before even about myself.

595
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,120
Read.

596
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:09,320
Come on !

597
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:16,680
"Thank you for your long letter.
I feel you really love me.

598
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:23,840
We should respect my family,
because of my position.

599
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:30,920
But we must and shall find the way,
how to live together, Ola.

600
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:35,440
Once you are here
we both shall calm down."

601
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:43,520
There is another woman, Čapek.
Not only yours...

602
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,680
Have you read Goethe ?

603
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:54,600
When he was very old,
like me today,

604
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,560
he met a girl...

605
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:03,720
Ulrike von Levetzow.

606
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,400
She was 17.

607
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:14,080
Her name is Oldra.

608
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:17,840
Almost like your actress.

609
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:24,640
Ulrike is German for Oldra.

610
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,680
I know only one Oldra...

611
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,760
I am writing a book with her too.

612
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,520
What about ?

613
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,520
About love.

614
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:51,840
About what I've been through.
Different from yours.

615
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:58,680
It's a novel. I always wanted
to write a novel. Since I was 16.

616
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:06,280
- With a lesson.
- Novels are not written for lessons.

617
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,120
Really ? And what for ?

618
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:13,840
For beauty, for love,
for a beauty of hope.

619
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:18,200
I've never read books to find beauty.

620
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:25,280
I studied novels to learn from them.

621
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:29,200
About the people living
in certain place and time.

622
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:35,200
I see. So now you're writing
a novel... with Oldra.

623
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:43,160
- You want to read a piece ?
- No, maybe when it's ready.

624
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:44,960
Thank you.

625
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,600
How old is she ?

626
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:52,520
Same age as our Jan,
I suppose. Or you.

627
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,600
I know, she could be my daughter.

628
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:08,000
After Charlotte passed away,

629
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:12,880
it took me long to realize
there were other women.

630
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:17,880
Something started to change
already during the war.

631
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:23,960
Štefánik had an educated
and beautiful girlfriend in Paris,

632
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:27,320
an Italian marquise.

633
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,920
Things happened...

634
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:43,480
Milan had disliked me since,
even politically.

635
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:50,480
I've known Oldra for a long time,

636
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:54,240
but she came into my life
only this summer.

637
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:59,440
What Alice and the others
mind about in your book

638
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:03,000
is not you or some chapter,

639
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:09,800
but the fact, that on the background
of all my words about love is her.

640
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:20,600
They call her "a merry lady"...
try to banish her from here and Lány.

641
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:24,600
But Oldra is still coming !

642
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:27,800
- When ?
- Tomorrow.

643
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:33,840
Are you also reading together ?

644
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,960
Our aim is to work on the novel

645
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:41,360
about me and all I've been through.

646
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:44,920
I suppose you are the main hero.

647
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:52,560
Oldra will combine Havlíček,
Comenius and St Paul.

648
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:57,360
And hopefully me too.

649
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:00,240
It sounds monumental.

650
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:05,880
I only hope there will be space
in it for some truth about you too.

651
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,520
Čapek, do you see those birds ?

652
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:14,080
- Yes.
- Are they pigeons ?

653
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:18,760
Magpies, I'd say.

654
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:22,120
Are you sure ?

655
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:25,600
Pigeon flies differently.

656
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:31,160
- Did you look carefully ?
- I did. Magpies.

657
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:38,000
Okay.
Now you said what the truth is.

658
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:43,160
You named its both main features.
The truth is what we can believe,

659
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:48,080
what we first observed or
experienced and later verified.

660
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:54,520
What we got from our eyes to
our heads and finally to our hearts.

661
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:59,160
That's what the truth is.

662
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:03,000
- You are writing detective stories.
- Yes.

663
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:06,720
What is the truth about a crime ?

664
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:10,280
When someone kills or just cheats ?

665
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:13,240
What is the truth about that act ?

666
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:17,680
Is it the general opinion
of the people around ?

667
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:23,560
Even the most horrible crime doesn't
say the truth about its offender.

668
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:27,560
Only the way he or she goes
about the crime brings the truth.

669
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:33,160
What conclusion a person draws
from the crime. That's the truth.

670
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:39,800
Complex questions can be answered
only by the whole human life.

671
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:47,160
The truth exists. But it's different
from what people mostly imagine.

672
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,400
I tell you an example.

673
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:54,960
Our Alice and the crowds of people
seeing me as a Daddy.

674
01:00:55,520 --> 01:01:00,440
They all think I have never
told a lie in my life.

675
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:03,120
And isn't it the truth ?

676
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,440
You know, what Alice often says ?

677
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:25,920
"You've always been an incarnation
of truth and conscience.

678
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:31,000
And now you're secretly meeting
a strange woman in a hotel."

679
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:37,320
I can't explain it. I don't even know
whether it's worth explaining.

680
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:42,240
I was brought up with the idea,

681
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:48,480
that physical love was something
unclean, not to be seen by others,

682
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:55,240
done in secret,
with the only aim to conceive.

683
01:01:55,760 --> 01:02:00,240
Charlie thought the same way

684
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:06,280
and we had lived like that
for 45 years in mutual love.

685
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:13,000
With Oldra I have understood
the core of physical love.

686
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:18,680
Passion can't be low.
Passion is natural.

687
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:23,200
Only abuse of the nature can be low.

688
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:31,120
It's like if you'd apologize

689
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:35,280
for sleeping, eating or walking.

690
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:41,520
A sin comes from the soul,
not from the body.

691
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:46,400
Body is clean. Natural.

692
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:53,920
Take a marriage. Hypocrites profess
the legal formality of the marriage.

693
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:59,560
But that's not what it is about
between a man and a woman.

694
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:06,000
The key is to stay together, come rain
or shine. With a paper or without.

695
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:10,960
I am not surprised Alice
doesn't like your opinion.

696
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:13,200
But I agree with you.

697
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:21,440
You also live with Olga neither in
a celibate nor a marriage, don't you ?

698
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:27,200
One could say about many people
that they have no soul.

699
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,680
You've always got a soul,

700
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:35,200
but discovered the body
only at the end. Sorry.

701
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:38,560
What for ?

702
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:42,960
Look, maybe I got crazy

703
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:50,240
but being with this woman

704
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:57,240
is more true for me
than anything else.

705
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:02,000
It's difficult
to put this truth into words.

706
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:06,800
You can rather feel it, live it.
You're deserving it.

707
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:13,680
Who knows what the truth about two
of us will be in a couple of years ?

708
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:20,800
Mr. President,

709
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:25,040
we have to publish that book.

710
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:38,840
Please. Let me have my way.

711
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:44,720
O.K. Let it be your way.

712
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:49,600
Your way.

713
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:08,760
Why do I believe in democracy ?

714
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:12,720
I believe in democracy...

715
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:17,960
Because I believe in people.

716
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:22,760
In their value.

717
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:30,000
In their immortal soul.

718
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:37,480
I believe in democracy
as I am a believer.

719
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:47,040
Democracy means to connect
with people because you like them.

720
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:56,480
Two eternities meet in democracy:
love to the Creator and love to a man.

721
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:05,040
The Republic will be as good
as the majority of people in it.

722
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:11,120
It's important for people to care
about what's happening around them.

723
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:17,640
And when they dislike something,
not just to complain,

724
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:20,680
but start to act.

725
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:24,080
Talking is not the same as acting.

726
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:30,160
People have never understood me.

727
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:34,720
But when I brought them the Republic
from the USA, everybody said:

728
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:37,640
Look ! Our Daddy.

729
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:40,760
They meant well.

730
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:45,320
But it wasn't the truth.
What kind of Daddy am I ?

731
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:51,040
How shall you title the book, Čapek ?

732
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:56,800
Čapek's interview with...

733
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:59,240
With the Daddy.

734
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:05,560
- I must go now.
- Of course.

735
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:14,000
Good luck.

736
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:16,560
- Good luck to you too.
- Thank you.

737
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:19,760
Could you please play
that record once more ?

738
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:22,640
The one you played before ?

739
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:28,400
Oh, I didn't know you liked
that kind of music.

740
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:30,960
Neither did I.

741
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:32,320
The first part of the
Talks with T. G. Masaryk,

742
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:36,520
The Age of Youth
was published at Christmas 1928.

743
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:40,560
Karel Čapek completed
the whole book in 1935.

744
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:45,720
The book Oldra Sedlmayerová was
writing with the president Masaryk

745
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:48,920
has never come into being.

746
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:04,120
TALKS WITH T.G. MASARYK
