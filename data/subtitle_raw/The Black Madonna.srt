1
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,226
(footsteps)

2
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,846
- Are you ready?
- What time is it?

3
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,275
- Just past midnight.
- Thank you.

4
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,031
(sigh)

5
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,956
Happy Birthday
Maria Hartmann.

6
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,406
(hooting and clapping)

7
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,995
- Isn't it Maria?
- Shit.

8
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,874
- It's fucking Maria Hartmann, isn't it?
- Like hell it is.

9
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,026
- Who is she?
- She goes to the business school.

10
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,435
In Niels' reading group.

11
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,570
Ah, Niels, you lucky bastard.

12
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,884
Hey, Maria! We will just have a picture
for the school magazine.

13
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,899
- You can't just fucking go.
- Wanna bet?

14
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,249
- They have paid for two shows.
- Then you can make the second. Good luck.

15
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,776
(plays "Happy Birthday")

16
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,670
- Kurt?
- Shut up for just two seconds.

17
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,668
- I have not talked for 20 minutes.
- You just have Kurt.

18
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,225
Why are you antisocial.
You're damn antisocial, man.

19
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,772
What the hell are you doing?
Aren't you going to write on the card?

20
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,873
Congratulations. It's there already.
You need to write who it is for.

21
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,634
"Hello Batman"...
You really take on, huh?

22
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,615
"Batman". It says "Dad"!

23
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,019
It looks as if it's Batman.

24
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,082
I'm sorry, honey.

25
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,899
I should have called, I know.

26
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,691
Something wrong?

27
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,616
- This is not right.
- What?

28
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,049
- Yes, us and our relationship.
- Because I'm late?

29
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,339
No, I can't manage this
lack of commitment.

30
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,506
It's not a lack of commitment.
We see each other often.

31
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,189
We don't at all.
I want something else.

32
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,814
Either you start to work less,
or so...

33
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,514
- I will probably...
- Stop that.

34
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,865
Sorry.

35
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,440
Sorry, I said.

36
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,151
What?

37
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,146
Darling.

38
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,675
I will, darling.

39
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,283
- Then you have to promise it.
- I promise it a hundred percent.

40
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,726
(a telephone number dialed)

41
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,609
- Yes, the truck is here.
- We are coming. - The vehicle is there. Go!

42
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,804
When we finish with the Russians
the niger in Halmstad has a job.

43
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,866
This is my last job.

44
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,436
- I will have to see, to believe it.
- There it is. Go!

45
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,166
Go on!

46
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,871
Stop!

47
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,002
Come here. Get out!

48
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,787
Here! Out!

49
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,666
Here!

50
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,707
In!

51
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,186
Leave me alone.

52
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,715
- Where is it?
- What?

53
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,916
Where is it?

54
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,345
"The Black Madonna"
is in one of the boxes.

55
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,881
Damn it.

56
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,396
- Hey.
- What's happening?

57
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,825
It's just the engine that stopped.
We are checking on it.

58
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,405
In a few minutes we are on the road again.

59
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,540
- Very well. Good luck with your work.
- Yes, thank you.

60
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:22,463
- What do you have back there?
- Some empty pallets and stuff.

61
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,586
- Can I see?
- Of course.

62
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,885
Hello? Is there anybody in there?

63
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,595
It's the police.
What the hell are you doing?

64
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,762
What the hell are you doing?

65
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,231
Stop!

66
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,176
Are you crazy?
Victor, dammit!

67
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,618
"After the motorcycle was hit,
we are searching for a black Iveco-truck."

68
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,645
- Sorry, I have to go.
- "The driver was wearing an orange jacket."

69
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,618
You understand that I'm tired
that your job always comes before me?

70
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:11,397
- I just wonder if you understand it.
- Yes, I understand that. I'm sorry.

71
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,360
(honking and braking)

72
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,775
- Would you call 1 12?
- What?

73
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,004
- What is happening? What the hell are you doing?
- Have you found it?

74
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,749
Not yet.
Here are all possible kinds of paintings.

75
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,930
- Stop! This is the police!
- What the hell is happening?

76
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,620
- Why didn't you hit him?
- Drop the gun!.

77
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,514
- Do you think you're hunting ducks?
- Kurt!

78
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,110
10 meters from you and you miss it.

79
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,425
- Yes! I have it.
- Are you blind or what?

80
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:04,382
- Come on, damn it, Kurt!
- Where the hell are you? Kurt!

81
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,934
He's fucking gone!
Get in the car, for God's sake!

82
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,510
That fucking bastard. He has fooled us.

83
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,020
I've never seen anything like that.
That huge, antisocial ass.

84
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,556
Just wait till I get hold
of that damn bastard...

85
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,865
- Shut up and drive.
- It can't be so difficult.

86
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,241
You go shoot and rob.

87
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,156
He ran that way.

88
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,356
Gustav!

89
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,761
(sirens)

90
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,355
Satan in hell. What the hell do I do?
Shut up, man.

91
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,540
Brian, you asshole!

92
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,251
Shit, damn.

93
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,001
Satan in hell.

94
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,560
Kurt! Stop now!

95
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,995
Yes, what is there so?

96
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,685
Kurt, dammit man.

97
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,185
What did you think?
We catch you every time.

98
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,619
It's only the third time,
Pedersen.

99
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,955
- Hi, Kurt.
- Hey, Ole.

100
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,130
- That was really hot last night, huh?
- Yes, that...

101
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,700
Will you please come in and put
your badge and your gun in my room?

102
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:55,493
- Really?
- You are suspended until the hearing.

103
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,546
Isn't it to overreact?

104
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,309
Think, you can't fire
1 1 shots in a residential area-

105
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,149
-without a hearing.
That's what the Ministry of Justice said.

106
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,875
The perpetrators started shooting.
That says the report.

107
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,417
Fine. So get some more ammunition
and go out and shoot more.

108
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,463
That's too stupid. I have, in addition,
arrested one of the perpetrators.

109
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,394
The prosecutor released him.
Kurt Hartmann had an alibi.

110
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,570
He was with half of Russia
throughout the evening.

111
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,892
And grow a real beard. It looks like,
You have sucked an exhaust.

112
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,179
- You shall just sign here.
- Okay.

113
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,611
Well, Kurt.

114
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,924
- Should I have an excuse?
- I know you know where the picture is.

115
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,773
- I'm a plumber.
- You have not seen a trap for 40 years.

116
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,121
See you again, Kurt.

117
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,226
- Thank you for now, Ole.
- Yes, see you.

118
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,148
(plays "Happy Birthday")
Hey, you forgot your card.

119
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,722
Hey, Kurt.

120
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,898
Where were you yesterday? I was
looking forward to meeting you.

121
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,379
I had a little problem,
but managed on that shit.

122
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,105
Come in here, Kurt.
It's cozy.

123
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,731
(plays "Happy Birthday")

124
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,343
So here we are. Now we certainly need
a small glass and something good to eat.

125
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,840
Have you tasted Golubtsy before?

126
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,299
Russian minced meat in the cabbage.
Very delicate.

127
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,545
Hi, Igor.

128
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,722
Is it him?

129
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,685
- Does he have the Madonna?
- Yes.

130
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,145
Give him the money
and let him go.

131
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,689
Are you sure he's okay?
He looks a little tired.

132
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:39,284
Mr. Tuschinsky kept his part of the
agreement. Do you have the Black Madonna?

133
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,555
- No.
- You don't.

134
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:48,090
Just a moment. What is happening?
Is there a problem?

135
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,170
- He hasn't the Madonna.
- He hasn't the Madonna?

136
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,364
What's he for?
Where did you find the idiot?

137
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,429
Now you must pull yourself together.
Get it right and get him out.

138
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,634
- Do you know where it is?
- Yes, I know who has it.

139
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:15,662
"And the weather. It will be windy
with a fresh breeze to gale."

140
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,139
Ole from show center.
What the hell are you doing?

141
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:24,183
You never run away from a show.
It will be deducted from your payment, bitch!

142
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,982
Maria it's dad.
Take your phone if you are at home.

143
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,339
Hey, it's dad.
I have sent you a package.

144
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,723
It is important that I get it.
You should get a number...

145
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,169
- "It was the weather, Caroline."
- "And now a new Danish art theft."

146
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,659
"The robbery last night was described
as the largest..."

147
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,789
You called Maria Hartmann.
leave a message.

148
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,594
Maria? I forgot the number.
You get it right here. Hello?

149
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,985
- Do not send gifts.
- It's not a gift.

150
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,090
"The painting is a famous icon,
The Black Madonna."

151
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,988
You called Maria Hartmann.
leave a message.

152
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,556
It's me again.
Forgive me for calling.

153
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,548
But I need to get hold of you.

154
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,754
You called Maria Hartmann.
leave a message.

155
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,906
Maria! It's important

156
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,476
- What are you doing?
- Have you received a letter from me today?

157
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,687
- Yes. There were not enough stamps on it.
- It's important that I get it.

158
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,309
I believe that the police think the same.

159
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,683
How much should you have
for not going to the police?

160
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,110
- 10.000.
- It's okay. Okay.

161
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,893
Okay? I should have said 20.
When do I get the money?

162
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,050
You come and bring the painting
and I give you the money.

163
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,049
- And you?
- What?

164
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,361
Congratulations.

165
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,851
(plays "Happy Birthday")

166
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,755
(breathe in)

167
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,949
- Can't you stop that?
- What?

168
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,938
You do not breathe. You breathe in
and then you don't breathe out.

169
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,259
It's just because I'm concentrated.

170
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,609
It's fucking annoying.
(plays "Happy Birthday")

171
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,965
Gustav.
Could you keep the card closed?

172
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,779
He has just written 'congratulations'.
Why that when it is already there?

173
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,451
It's an unsolved mystery.

174
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,350
You're right, Gustav,
it's a really good tune.

175
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,620
Especially if you hear it
over and over again.

176
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,671
Are you not going home?

177
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,539
- How big was the stolen painting?
- Not very big, but expensive.

178
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,394
- Around this big?
- Approx. See you tomorrow

179
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,465
Can you give me a lift?

180
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,179
I feel a little like
I've eaten too much meat.

181
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,829
I feel a little bloated...

182
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:37,913
So you might get to be
slightly awake at night.

183
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,571
It's the fucking cops.

184
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,987
It's the damn cops. Go!
Those nosy bastards.

185
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,681
- Maria Hartmann?
- Yes.

186
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,059
My name is Gustav Pedersen.
Have you heard from your father today?

187
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,419
- Do you have the money?
- The money?

188
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:03,314
- Do you have the money or not?
- I come from the police.

189
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,274
- Absolutely.
- I'm investigating a case.

190
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,836
- Show me your badge.
- My badge?

191
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,454
If you are from the police,
then you have a police badge.

192
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:20,293
- Technically speaking, I have a badge...
- I'll call the police.

193
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,210
I am from the police.

194
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,555
Let me just explain.

195
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,755
- Where is the gnome?
- In the bath.

196
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,209
Igor! Igor!

197
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:07,013
It was teeming with cops over there.
There were two cops with his daughter.

198
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,566
- Are you sure?
- 100 percent.

199
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,019
They both had gleaming
water-combed hair.

200
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:20,396
That son of a bitch. Shoot the jerk with
the cap and throw him into the water.

201
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,105
What is happening?

202
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,933
- The police came first to Maria.
- The police?

203
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:38,372
Anyway, I'm glad that we
enjoyed ourselves a little.

204
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,859
The police is in the apartment,
so don't bother Igor.

205
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,460
Now he goes home. It was not
what we agreed, was it, Kurt?

206
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:50,269
You should have come with
the painting yesterday.

207
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,926
It's bad, Kurt.

208
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:02,010
Shitty day.
Mother fucker-Damned fucking ass. Shitty day.

209
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,329
Satan's ass.
Bastard ass-fucking-shitty day.

210
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,570
Piss-fucking-bollocks.

211
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,060
(phone rings)
Dog's head!

212
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:23,433
You can't fucking do it there.
You'll make a hole in the boat. Idiot.

213
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:29,322
You won't make such a mess.
Wrap him up well. He's fat.

214
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,561
Just hold it.

215
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,291
- Hello?
- Are you trying to cheat me?

216
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,659
- He does not have the money.
- Who?

217
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,668
That unpleasant motherfucker with
pubic hair in his face. Gustav...

218
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,770
- The cop?
- So he is really a cop?

219
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,405
That was what I fucking said.

220
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,266
Fucking shit!

221
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,539
I have given him power enough
to illuminate Esbjerg.

222
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,126
- Do you still have the painting?
- Yes.

223
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,010
She has the painting.
We can get it.

224
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,049
- The daughter has the painting.
- Goodbye, goodbye.

225
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,523
- Igor is really indifferent.
- What is it? Go now!

226
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:13,198
Can she come to Kaliningrad
with the painting? We will be there.

227
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,364
- It's not a good idea.
- It's a really good idea, Kurt.

228
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,232
A really good one.

229
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,633
It's called Landuskin Marina.
In Kaliningrad.

230
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,269
- Maria, take the painting with you to Kaliningrad.
- To where?

231
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,979
You take a ferry to Poland and then
a train to Kaliningrad. It's easy.

232
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,403
- I will not fucking go there.
- It takes at most a day.

233
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:45,093
- I have tests in a week.
- Have you started to study?

234
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,340
- It's not of your damn business.
- You get 200 kg.

235
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,109
- It's a good day's wage.
- I'll do it for one million.

236
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,026
One million!
Now you must control yourself.

237
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,441
Shall I do it?

238
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:00,525
- That's how I educated you?
- You have never educated me.

239
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,189
You needed to be there to do it.
Which ferry should I take?

240
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:11,510
You need to go to Landuskin Marina.
Take the Swinoujscie ferry to Poland.

241
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:16,020
Then it's just to the east.
Kaliningrad. It's damn easy.

242
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,747
Bye.

243
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,347
Idiot.

244
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:26,527
"The Black Madonna" is as famous
in Poland as "Mona Lisa" in France.

245
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,216
Painted with gold leaf on oak.

246
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,194
They have smeared the gold leaf on
with eggs. It's fucking disgusting.

247
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:38,997
I bet that his daughter knows
where that antisocial bastard is.

248
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,026
- He has blown us.
- Hell, he has not.

249
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,266
Maybe you can see the
Madonna somewhere else?

250
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,665
Kurt shouldn't have thought
that he is smarter than me.

251
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:53,123
- It's violence against an officer on duty.
- One who refused to identify himself.

252
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,893
- And who was trying to get in.
- Maybe. But you are in trouble.

253
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,446
- In trouble?
- Yes.

254
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,070
Where have they found you?
You talk as if you were on the 80's.

255
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,816
It's an invaluable piece of art.

256
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,940
I know exactly
what it's worth to me.

257
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,789
Give me the painting.
You can get four years behind bars.

258
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,650
- Behind bars?
- Yes.

259
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,096
Are you a striptease dancer?

260
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,028
- Striptease dancer?
- "DM strip". What is it about?

261
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,106
Who can take off their clothes quicker?

262
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:41,650
I can earn 10,000 in one evening
by shaking the ass.

263
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,615
For men like you.
Who is the most ridiculous?

264
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,115
I don't fucking care.

265
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,625
I pay no money for...
I'm engaged.

266
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,514
Oh, how romantic. Does he
also have this framed ass-beard?

267
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,536
There's food in the refrigerator.

268
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,796
Hey, hey, hey!

269
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,472
(sighing)

270
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,416
You go insanely slow.

271
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:12,940
There she is!
Where is Kurt and the Madonna?

272
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,736
Fucking assholes.

273
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,121
Damn hell. Fucking Hell.

274
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,805
Fucking shitty day.

275
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,283
- Someone could think you were four years old.
- Shh! Piss-shit-bollocks.

276
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,804
- She's not opening. Watch out.
- No, no, no. The body.

277
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,085
Hold them right here.

278
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,147
(roar)

279
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,895
Yes, that was good.

280
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:50,363
Holy shit, that's the damn cop.

281
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,155
Where is the girl?
And where is Kurt, the antisocial bastard?

282
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,225
I don't know.

283
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,891
You keep an eye on him.

284
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,259
Oh, what a hell. Such a bullshit.

285
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,836
She should be fucking shot,
the bitch.

286
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,988
She is also a bloody
antisocial bastard. Arrgh!

287
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,796
(he gets power)

288
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,670
(something smashed)
Oh, what a hell.

289
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,785
- Where is Kurt?
- I don't know.

290
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:40,539
Holy shit. Do you think
I'm stupid? Where is he?

291
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,585
I don't know!

292
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,706
- Fuck, he hits hard.
- Oh, what a hell.

293
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,396
Where's the Madonna?

294
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,721
Where is it?

295
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,842
(he gets power)

296
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,130
Hey, hey, hey!
You can't leave me here.

297
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,765
Damn fucking shitty life.

298
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,634
- Hello. Central Alarm.
- Shit! Damn fucking shit.

299
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,355
This is Gustav Pedersen, KA.
Hey! Give me the keys.

300
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,516
Sure, have a good time!

301
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,241
Gustav Pedersen, KA.

302
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,576
Shoot now, man! Shoot now!

303
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:34,124
It's a hunting rifle.
How the hell do you fail to hit?

304
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,771
Yet he failed, you jerk!

305
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,822
Hell!

306
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,291
Damn psychopaths.

307
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,035
- Do you know what time is it?
- No. Quarter past eight.

308
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,856
The time is 20.15,
and you are under arrest.

309
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,460
Suspicion of complicity in theft
and assaulting a police officer on duty.

310
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:00,724
I must make you aware
that you have the right to not...

311
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,480
Idiot, man.

312
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:15,380
It's a tiny museum.
Two guards, nine custodians.

313
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,256
Munch paintings for 920 million.

314
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,723
She is also a fucking
antisocial bastard.

315
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,980
Like her shitty father.

316
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,031
What the hell?

317
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,180
- Victor, come here.
- What is it?

318
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,209
She's on a fucking trip.

319
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:41,094
- They have cheated on us, bloody hell.
- La-n-duskin.

320
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,180
- You must stop the Poland ferry.
- Good idea.

321
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:49,269
Do you know what suspended means?
What about we close Kastrup?

322
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,851
"The Black Madonna" is on board.

323
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,858
- Listen now, you're suspended.
- Yes, I know, but...

324
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,940
- What the hell is that?
- I'm looking for...

325
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:05,803
You must wait for the hearing.
Don't run around alone, right?

326
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:12,467
No of course not. "The Black
Madonna" is on its way to Poland.

327
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:16,650
- Are you taking it on the ferry?
- Yes.

328
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:21,333
- Have you shot someone?
- What have I done? No.

329
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,295
- You go nowhere.
- I promise.

330
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,366
- Get out!
- Give me the picture.

331
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:58,388
- No, it's mine.
- It's a Polish national treasure.

332
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:03,298
I don't give a damn.
It's mine, and take off your hand!

333
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:08,918
You can't go all the way to Poland
in a lifeboat. So do Laurel and Hardy.

334
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,140
Come on, Brian.
You need to get in a better shape.

335
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,111
Fuck!

336
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,891
- Have you looked there?
- She's gone.

337
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,510
She can't just disappear.
We are on a ferry.

338
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:31,203
That's damn stupid.
Plastic chairs are a stupid choice.

339
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,169
You go that way,
And I look over here.

340
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,914
- Give me the picture and get rid of trouble.
- No thanks.

341
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,202
Piss off.

342
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,436
Two psychopaths looking for you.
You can't stay here.

343
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,666
- Wait and see.
- I think I'll do that.

344
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,936
Thank you.

345
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:13,286
Then you add some curry,
but Brussels sprouts can get too much...

346
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,524
It must be nice
to have such a helpful daughter.

347
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,086
Maybe. She's lovely.

348
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,335
Her birthday was yesterday.

349
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,641
Congratulations.

350
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,882
What did you give her?

351
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:33,170
We are not the kind of giving gifts.
I wrote her a long letter .

352
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,324
They are also bad to play.
They just sit and count the money.

353
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,091
How old has she become?

354
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,050
Do you have a picture of her?

355
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,396
Yes.

356
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,964
This is her today.
This is a job she has.

357
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,306
- She is a cute girl.
- Thank you.

358
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,522
Send it to Kuntz.

359
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,355
- Hey, my picture.
- Yes, you will get it back.

360
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,032
She is sexy.

361
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,579
What the hell?
Tell me, are you blind?

362
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,724
The blue piece is heaven.
Do you have silicone in your brain?

363
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,616
Is it almost 10 o'clock?

364
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,594
You said I'm under arrest,
so I won't tell you that.

365
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:43,770
I just had an agreement
down in the laundry room.

366
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,100
"The ferry will be in port
in a few minutes."

367
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,546
Good morning.

368
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,099
- Are you stalking me?
- No, I'm not.

369
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,156
Fuck!

370
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,436
Shitty asshole.

371
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,804
- Quiet. The police is down the quay.
- Well, say hello from me.

372
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,911
What do you mean?

373
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,714
I contacted the captain
when you fell asleep.

374
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,425
- Do you never let go?
- No, I don't.

375
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,006
Give me the picture.

376
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,555
Gustav it's washing time...

377
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:37,349
I have a million in Poland.
That's all I have.

378
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,290
I will not be arrested. Not now.

379
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,930
Hey! What the hell are you doing,
you crazy bitch?

380
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,340
She is fucking insane.

381
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,196
Fucking ho! Fuck!

382
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,156
Fuck! Shit!

383
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,265
(screams)

384
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,346
Now, haven't I got too much
Brussels sprouts?

385
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,269
Damn shit fucking bollocks, too,
fucking shitty day...

386
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,075
Fucking disgusting, dammit!

387
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,521
Damn shit!

388
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,171
Shit, damn!

389
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:11,050
Shut up belly flop!
Was you trained in the police?

390
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,869
- I landed on my legs.
- It must have hurt!

391
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,986
- I actually landed on my feet!
- No.

392
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,988
- I won't bother arguing with you.
- It's so fucking stupid.

393
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:28,226
- Very cheap.
- Do you know where the train is?

394
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,056
- Very cheap.
- No, thank you. Do you know where the train is?

395
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,340
- Waterproof. Very cheap.
- The train!

396
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,916
Take and piss off.
Otherwise I'll stick it in.

397
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,459
Hello, nice to meet you.
My name is Adam Kuntz.

398
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,780
- Gustav Pedersen, KA.
- Your shit!

399
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,754
- The time is 8.55, and you are under arrest.
- Do you have the Madonna?

400
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,429
- Top boy, scout snitch!
- She said yes.

401
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,471
Here is my car.

402
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,315
Oh, for hell, man!

403
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,131
- What are you doing, man?
- Let me go!

404
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,989
You've just thrown a saucepan
in the head of the Interpol.

405
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,115
Damn shit, dammit!

406
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,375
What are you doing, you crazy bitch?

407
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:27,163
- Are you completely insane?
- Do you believe he is from the Interpol?

408
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,866
Polska, Polska, Polska.

409
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:44,374
Do you have a more modern
and bigger gun?

410
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,051
He doesn't understand a word.

411
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,851
You are so negative. See how nice.

412
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,810
- Kipling and genuine leather.
- Niggers!

413
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,634
Shut up, there she is.
You go that way and I go this way.

414
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,285
Stop now, your anti-social bitch!

415
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,514
- Fuck off with you!
- Victor, I have her!

416
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,505
Maria!

417
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,811
- Come in now!
- Run.

418
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,179
- Give me the painting.
- Nope, it's mine.

419
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:38,346
- Give me that!
- Don't you touch it!

420
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,706
- Brian, stop them!
- Oh, for hell.

421
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,336
Damn, Brian.

422
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,613
- They could bind books later.
- They run there dammit! Come on!

423
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,802
You should lose weight.

424
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,283
- I think I broke my arm.
- I don't give a damn!

425
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:12,511
Whatever you have broken,
you will just deliver the Madonna now!

426
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,690
Amateur! Did you get run over by a slut?
Get that picture.

427
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,995
So, here is a dream cake.

428
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,811
Find the Madonna!

429
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,791
What is happening?

430
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:29,967
You are a fucking sissy!
Just find the bitch!

431
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:34,534
It's just because your daughter
has smashed Igors best man. Here!

432
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,291
- Have you sent someone after her?
- Yes, sure.

433
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,659
- Will anybody have cake?
- Yes please!

434
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:47,357
- I can just bloody pay her.
- Why?

435
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,546
- Because we have an arrangement.
- No, no!

436
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:55,094
- You have an arrangement. We have not.
- It's you who fucking have!

437
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,250
You have not even touched your cake.
You're so fond of sweets.

438
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,899
You get the Madonna with your daughter,
you receive the money.

439
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:10,249
If we get it,
then you receive nothing.

440
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,949
Try to call and find out
how far she is.

441
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,441
- She's not answering.
- Well.

442
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,891
Shit phone.

443
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,416
- Be careful now. Give it to me.
- It's mine.

444
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,690
- Just like the painting is not yours.
- Shut up!

445
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,145
Moreover, it's nothing without
magazine. Give it to me.

446
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,721
(breathe in)

447
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,160
- Stop that.
- What?

448
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,266
You hold your breath.
It seems you're dead.

449
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,268
- Then I could not drive.
- That you can't almost do either.

450
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,176
You drive very slowly.

451
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,240
(breathe in)

452
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,811
- So you did that again.
- No.

453
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,656
You don't breathe.

454
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,121
I sure do that.

455
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,136
May I say something?

456
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,750
- You run like a girl.
- I don't do that at all.

457
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,882
You do that for sure.

458
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,715
You run with your arms out sideways.
Just as if you were going to fly.

459
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,626
Aha!

460
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,600
May I say one more thing?

461
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:08,059
Those glasses
are in fact a girl's model.

462
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:12,170
You don't look at all like
a police officer with them.

463
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,555
Who the hell do you think you are?

464
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,690
You just sit and quibble.
Negative energies all the time.

465
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,930
You are like my ex-girlfriend.
You sit and knock everybody down.

466
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:27,204
Nothing is good enough.
No movie, no book, people. Nothing!

467
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,635
- Your ex?
- What?

468
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,725
- Is she your ex or your girlfriend?
- What the hell do you care?

469
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:44,324
You think you're so smart. Everyone can
see that you have had a shitty childhood.

470
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:49,258
Now you're trying to compensate by stripping,
so that someone cares to look at you.

471
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:54,548
Maybe I don't resemble all the men
you tend to be abandoned by-

472
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:59,418
-but I am who I am,
and I don't intend to change that.

473
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,842
If you say so.

474
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,506
Fine.

475
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,090
This sausage is not made of an
animal that has grown up on a farm.

476
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,089
- What do you mean?
- It tastes like cat.

477
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:53,189
You have obviously tasted it several
times. I think it tastes good.

478
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,235
I have actually tasted cat.

479
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,506
In the military, I applied
for the commando troops.

480
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,620
We had been on exercise
for five days without food.

481
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,979
Then, we found a dead cat.
So we ate it.

482
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:11,329
- So, didn't you come in that time?
- No, but that was close.

483
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,371
- Can't you try again?
- Too late.

484
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,546
I think otherwise,
You were pretty rough before.

485
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:23,060
Sorry it was not the intention
that it would be so hard.

486
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,576
It suited you, actually.

487
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:41,484
- Will you do me a favor?
- I don't think so.

488
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,035
What are you thinking?

489
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,749
Can't you deliver the painting
to the Danish consulate in Gdansk?

490
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,326
Why are you so stubborn?

491
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,950
I can't go home without it.
What should I do?

492
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,969
It's not my problem.

493
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,796
- What is happening?
- Run!

494
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:13,308
Run it! He comes again.
He will push us off the road.

495
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,987
It's good.

496
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,752
Fuck!

497
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,562
Step on the accelerator.

498
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,236
- Fuck! Turn in!
- I'm trying! Shut up!

499
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,625
Fuck!

500
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:35,099
Beware of the cow. Haven't you
learnt it at the police academy?

501
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:38,346
- Run away from him!
- There's no grip.

502
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,265
(car alarm)

503
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,385
Shit!

504
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,220
You don't need a seat belt. Such a
truck is equivalent to 200 cars.

505
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:55,130
We drive straight over
the little car.

506
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:00,370
You must be the police's worst driver.

507
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,500
Now, we drive straight over them.

508
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:06,165
This is equivalent to a speed bump.

509
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:12,508
- That's it, hold on.
- So run over them!

510
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,731
Stop! We didn't hit them.

511
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,271
(screams)

512
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,829
Fucking shit! Damn shitty day!

513
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,722
(groans)

514
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:43,226
We'd better get away from here.

515
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,481
You are bleeding.

516
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,881
What is it?

517
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,241
The Madonna, please.

518
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,851
Move away from the car.

519
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,525
Damn fucking shit.

520
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,400
(he runs away)

521
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,882
(yelling)

522
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,700
How much do you think such a cow costs?

523
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:44,825
When I was 12,
and we still lived in Sweden-

524
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,499
-I got a horse from my father
as a birthday gift.

525
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:56,567
I was happy.
Imagine what a hero I was at school.

526
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:01,339
- I had got a horse from my father.
- Yes, it must have been wonderful.

527
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:09,803
The problem was that the money
came from a robbery at the post office.

528
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:13,145
So the day after the police came
and picked up my father.

529
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,659
and afterwards fetched the horse.

530
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,745
Well...

531
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,315
How do you tell your friends,
you don't have a horse anymore?

532
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,500
And that your father is in Vridsløse?

533
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:34,435
- Was he ever at home?
- Yes.

534
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:37,540
When he was, it was not for long.

535
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,979
There was always some reason to leave.

536
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,596
There is no car.

537
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,615
God dammit! Holy fucking shit.

538
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:52,254
Would you bother stop cursing,
since you are so bad at it?

539
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:55,830
We get a lift, catch him up,
and get hold of that painting.

540
00:48:55,960 --> 00:49:00,613
- Awesome plan!
- There we have it again. Irony and talk talk talk.

541
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:05,498
Honestly. The man is driving a car.
We can't catch up an asthmatic snail.

542
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:11,004
I'm hurt, and you run as a cheerleader.
What were you thinking?

543
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,681
What about this guy?

544
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,156
He doesn't have a car.

545
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:22,665
So what a hell will he do
with two gallons of gasoline?

546
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,610
It's put together with adhesive tape.

547
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,275
It must be okay.
Don't be so girly.

548
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,745
I'm not fucking girly.
Just look at him.

549
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,668
Pilots are some of the most
checked people out there.

550
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,065
They are checked in the head and ass.

551
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:51,909
Excuse me, Mr.
Could we have a lift, please?

552
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:57,764
You have to speak up. My ears don't work.
Too much noise in plane.

553
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:07,498
- Can we have a lift in your plane?
- Yeah, no problem!

554
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:10,046
- Thank you.
- I came for the sausage.

555
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:13,670
The best sausage of Poland.

556
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:19,509
- Departure. We now fly. No sleep. Fly.
- It's fucking perfect.

557
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,219
- Do you want some?
- No thanks.

558
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,656
It's very good for your head
when you're tired.

559
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,850
It keeps you awake.
And it's good for stomach too.

560
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:01,283
- He's also a fucking junkie.
- Relax, you're not at work.

561
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,185
You know what...

562
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,036
Hello?

563
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,829
- Move!
- Hello? Damn!

564
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,179
Take the stick. Can you keep it?

565
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,436
We'll crash! Hello?

566
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,896
Hold it there.
Can you keep it?

567
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,315
Is he dead?

568
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:29,099
Hello? How can you sleep when
you have sniffed a pound of coke?

569
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:33,739
What are all those buttons for?
If I pull, we'll go up.

570
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,946
You must not go up.
We call for help.

571
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:41,733
- We must not go up, we must go down.
- That's what I'm trying to.

572
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,922
We'll crash!

573
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,856
Take it there. Hold it there.

574
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,810
There are pedals. It's like a car.

575
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:53,748
- Mayday!
- It's like a car.

576
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:57,850
- Find a field with a haystack.
- A haystack, then we are saved.

577
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:01,339
Just get it down.
What the hell are you doing? We are plunging!

578
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:07,646
I turned on purpose. There he is.
He has the damn bag over his shoulder.

579
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:11,190
Now you no longer go down.
Stay here.

580
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,675
He has the fucking Madonna.

581
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:16,980
- How much is the green?
- 3,30.

582
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:23,724
- What if we attack him from behind?
- It's a really good idea.

583
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:27,628
- So find something else.
- I'll do that! Bring the plane down!

584
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,285
Climb out on the wing.

585
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:33,500
Climb out on the wing.
I mean it.

586
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:38,782
- Are you completely insane?
- So I do it myself. Hold the steering wheel.

587
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,451
What the hell are you doing?

588
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,455
- Hold the steering wheel still.
- I'll do.

589
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:48,388
Are you completely insane?
I can't keep it.

590
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:51,045
- What the hell are you doing?
- Down!

591
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,846
- Completely down. Lower.
- What?

592
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,161
Lower!

593
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,936
Down, dammit!
Use the pedals!

594
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,041
- I'm trying.
- Hold it.

595
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,385
I'm trying.
I can't.

596
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:12,650
- Hold it.
- I can't keep it quiet!

597
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,649
Now you must not go too far down.

598
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,995
What are you doing?

599
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:27,419
Straighten Up!
Pull the steering wheel, dammit!

600
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:29,801
Pull the steering wheel!

601
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,955
Down! There he is.

602
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:39,339
There on the left. You missed.

603
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,082
Quiet!

604
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,765
- Right there.
- I have him.

605
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:04,444
"Caution. Caution."
(alarm)

606
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:20,585
Are you at home in the cave?
Yeah, it's you I'm talking to.

607
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:25,498
There are crumbs everywhere.
The carpet was expensive.

608
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,976
- Give me the bag.
- Don't be stupid.

609
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:37,499
- Come with the bag!
- He's fucking brave.

610
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:40,336
But he stinks of garlic.

611
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,756
(phone rings)

612
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,131
Hello? Adam. How are you?

613
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,090
Has she got hold of the painting again?

614
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:04,290
A plane?
Have you broken a few fingers?

615
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:08,729
So beware of the other arm. Hello.

616
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:13,349
- Maria is not hurt.
- That's a lie.

617
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:18,543
No, she has just flown over
Igor's best man with an airplane.

618
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:24,034
Yes, it may sound a little weird,
but she has the Madonna.

619
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:29,109
- So now you can release Igor.
- I don't believe a damn thing you say anymore.

620
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:34,718
Kurt, you have always been able to
trust on me. Nothing happens to you.

621
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,711
Just let go.

622
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,326
You go away.

623
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,482
Go away!

624
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:47,820
Kurt, I understand you well.
I'm here only to help.

625
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,970
- Is he okay?
- He breathes.

626
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:01,170
- But he's probably not in a good mood.
- So let's just proceed.

627
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:05,250
- We can't fucking do that.
- Oh, okay. So see you later.

628
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:08,090
We can't fucking do that, damn.

629
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,867
THANK YOU

630
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:29,084
- God only knows what's the name of this town.
- Something with 24 consonants.

631
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:33,324
If you had kept the plane in the air,
we would be on our way home.

632
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:38,173
I'm sorry I didn't let you
fall out from a mile high.

633
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:43,092
Hello. Do you know
where we can find a hotel?

634
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,659
- I don't like it.
- No, that's fine.

635
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:53,345
Hotel? English?

636
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:56,051
Someone must speak English here.

637
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,954
They all certainly have
a doctorate from Yale.

638
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,969
Otherwise, they can't join the EU.

639
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,281
We have no money.

640
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,625
We are broke,
and we are just travelling.

641
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:14,357
- Stig. You must be Stig.
- It doesn't sound so nice.

642
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:20,083
Hey, look who it is.
My mom is a big fan of you.

643
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,220
Just go in.

644
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:29,900
Mom! Take a break.
See who I have invited.

645
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,966
You are Stig.

646
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:39,780
- What?
- "Les Miserables".

647
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,075
- What is she saying?
- I didn't understand.

648
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,860
Come here, everybody!

649
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,400
Come and say hello to Stig Rossen.

650
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,282
Stig Rossen!

651
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,715
Yes, I know him well.

652
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:05,420
- Does she believe that I'm Stig Rossen?
- Yes!

653
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:09,785
I'm not...
I don't look like Stig Rossen.

654
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:15,108
But you do. Now let it go.
We need to sleep.

655
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,055
Do you have a place we can sleep?
Can we sleep here?

656
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,691
Stig is sleeping with us.

657
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,526
Welcome, Stig.

658
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:31,546
Can I... Can I buy some... some clothes?

659
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,435
Can I buy one of these?

660
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:40,410
It would be very nice, because
my... my... my clothes are very wet.

661
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:43,825
(plays "We dance rock and roll")

662
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:54,132
- Can I buy it?
- You are a woman.

663
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:58,935
This is very nice.

664
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,769
Let him get some rest.

665
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:10,416
I'll smash you if you say something.

666
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:13,370
It's beautiful.

667
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:18,269
You look like the queen,
when she is in Greenland.

668
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,779
My clothes were wet.
I must go to bed now.

669
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:25,376
Are you not going to sleep?

670
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,631
Stig!

671
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:33,963
Now you sing for us.

672
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:37,026
Listen here. Now Stig will sing for us.

673
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,243
Sing. "Les Miserables".

674
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,549
Picasso is not actually worth
much money.

675
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:54,025
"Flying dog" - 20 million.
"Teacups" - 38.

676
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:59,302
While Munch's painting "The Scream"
in Oslo is 400 million worth.

677
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,380
- Isn't it strange?
- I don't know.

678
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:07,059
Many people think that stealing paintings is
the most difficult. But you know what it is?

679
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:14,430
Shut up now. I have heard of this
paintings shit for the last 256 km.

680
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:18,314
- Can't you talk about something else?
- What?

681
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,522
I'm thirsty.

682
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:30,714
(Gustav sings "We dance rock and roll")

683
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:38,194
What the hell is this cat moaning?

684
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:42,450
It sounds very good.
It's a good melody.

685
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:46,769
- It sounds like crap, it's false.
- Hell, it's surely not.

686
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:52,465
Niggers.

687
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,525
Shut up, you sing badly.

688
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,402
It went fine.

689
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:06,596
Good night.

690
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,696
That, which hangs down the neck.

691
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:35,866
Is it some kind of cap?

692
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,176
It looks incredibly real.

693
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:45,869
It's 100 percent nylon, all this shit.

694
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:02,709
Yes, if one didn't know
that you were an...

695
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:07,539
...annoying striptease dancer
from Vesterbro, so...

696
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:16,506
What then, if one didn't know it?

697
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:21,915
So one would think,
you are somewhat lovely in that dress.

698
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,746
Well...

699
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,573
If one didn't know
you were a stiff cop from...

700
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:39,979
- Where are you from?
- Roskilde.

701
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:41,906
Well...

702
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,841
What then?

703
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,275
What?

704
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:53,503
If one didn't know I was a
stiff cop from Roskilde, what then?

705
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:56,410
I don't know yet.

706
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,796
What are you doing?

707
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:11,068
They say that you are not a real man until
you have kissed someone in a folk costume.

708
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:17,115
They are right.

709
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:34,775
Do you really have a crush on folk dancers?

710
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:37,411
Sick bastard.

711
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,241
What?

712
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:20,450
- It never happens in stories.
- What never happens in stories?

713
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:24,394
That the girl doesn't know what
to do with the lower arm.

714
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:55,340
Have you always wanted to be a cop?

715
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:57,266
Yes.

716
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:04,059
I like you better as Stig Rossen.

717
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:16,996
Not to be an annoying ass,
but the state also offers a reward.

718
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:40,795
How much?

719
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:45,693
Enough for you to keep your clothes on,
until you take your exam.

720
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,689
Is it not what you want?

721
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:59,626
Here you are.

722
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:03,620
- Really?
- Take it.

723
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:09,049
(phone rings)

724
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,925
It's working.

725
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:16,786
Hello?

726
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,451
- Hi, Maria.
- Who is it?

727
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:22,410
Do you have "The Black Madonna"?

728
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,922
Maybe, why?

729
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:28,890
- Can I get it?
- No.

730
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:33,739
It would be good if it was
in Landuskin within two hours.

731
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:38,652
Otherwise, you can fish up your dad
out of the water in four different places.

732
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:41,411
Bye, Maria Hartmann.

733
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:48,396
What's happening?

734
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:56,269
They'll kill him
if they don't get the painting.

735
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:59,506
They're just trying to put pressure on you.

736
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:06,570
We don't know if Kurt is with them.

737
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:11,373
Maybe I have an asshole shitty father,
but they can't cut him into pieces.

738
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:13,880
Of course not.

739
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:18,739
- Give me the painting.
- I'll call the police. Hello?

740
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:23,220
- Give me the painting.
- Relax. I'm trying to help.

741
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:26,441
Hello?

742
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,931
Maria, wait a minute.

743
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:33,482
Maria.

744
01:08:56,120 --> 01:09:01,308
Another thing that people don't know is
worth the money is iron. Scrap iron.

745
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:05,404
It's worth the cash. There are no guards.
Yes, there are dogs, right?

746
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:09,684
- So I got ride of the Wunderbaum.
- You can get plenty of wires.

747
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:14,123
- There are the cop and...
- Shut up, there she is! Brian, come.

748
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:33,980
Have you seen this tool, Victor?
It runs on pneumatics.

749
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:37,868
- It is typical Russian to do things like that.
- How the heck does it work?

750
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:47,775
What a hell,
this is a good thing.

751
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:09,234
There are the bitch and Kuntz,
the amateur.

752
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:16,027
The Madonna has to be with them.
Otherwise he's finished.

753
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:22,132
She looks like the picture.
But she is a little skinny.

754
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:29,883
- Beware she doesn't beat you, Kuntz.
- She's not so big.

755
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:35,105
Isn't it quite embarrassing?
Get up, slut.

756
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:39,676
She's actually quite delicious.

757
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:46,036
- Good morning, Maria Hartmann.
- Where is my father?

758
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:49,015
- Do you have something for me?
- Yes, here.

759
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,115
Can I get it?

760
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:55,386
No, I want to see my dad first.

761
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:02,722
Take her bag!

762
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:06,626
Stop!

763
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:09,246
Or The Madonna goes into the water.

764
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:20,429
That would be quite stupid.

765
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:23,620
- I'll do it. I want to see my father.
- Calm down. Let's take it from the beginning.

766
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:27,764
You give me the Madonna,
then I release Kurt immediately.

767
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:29,552
No.

768
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,305
Dammit! Fucking shit!

769
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:35,971
Do you have more complaints?

770
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:42,916
- No.
- Yes.

771
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:47,005
Damn hell. Fucking piss bollocks.

772
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:52,388
Piss-shit-fuck. Damn ass.

773
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:33,595
What?

774
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:37,594
- You look like your mother.
- You look like shit.

775
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:40,746
I haven't always been a real father.

776
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:44,805
I've been a little "on and off",
inside and outside.

777
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:48,924
- It's too late to apologize now.
- Yes, it damn is.

778
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:58,490
This is my last job.
From now on, I have plenty of time.

779
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,602
From now on?

780
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:07,284
I don't need you now.
I needed you when I was born.

781
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:11,404
My first day at school,
when I had surgery, when mom died.

782
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:14,136
But now? Well...

783
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:17,690
- Good heavens.
- No, but...

784
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:20,820
What the hell do I need you for?

785
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:29,586
I have become a very good grandpa.

786
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:31,756
Grandpa?

787
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:39,494
- Can you see any small child here?
- No, but I suppose you have a boyfriend.

788
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,386
No.

789
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:57,305
I have none.
I have no boyfriend.

790
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:01,562
(footsteps)

791
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:07,371
Where is the Madonna?

792
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:10,899
- At my partner. He's a police officer.
- And where is he?

793
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:16,228
I don't know.
He's coming with all the Interpol.

794
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:22,666
Have you become girlfriend of a cop?

795
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:29,075
- Yes.
- Shut up.

796
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:32,419
Isn't it the one with the beard?

797
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:35,415
- He comes with the whole force?
- No.

798
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:38,825
- You just said it.
- Yes, but he doesn't, okay?

799
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:54,258
Goodbye, Kurt.
As usual you have ruined everything.

800
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:58,035
- Departure!
- Let us put an end to it.

801
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:02,628
For your information, this means:
We sail now.

802
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:10,918
- Be careful now, Kuntz. The staircase are steep.
- Hold tight.

803
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:16,156
Goodbye, Kurt.

804
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:28,401
(ship horn)

805
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:46,033
Tell me, what is this all about?
Now come the two new idiots.

806
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:49,339
- Give us Kurt Hartmann, or you will die.
- Who?

807
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:52,859
I said, give us Kurt Hartman now,
and the money.

808
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,299
- Which money?
- Give us Kurt Hartmann you mother fuckers!

809
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,761
It's good, Brian.

810
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:14,441
- Ouch!
- Fuck...

811
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:17,746
Piss and shit.

812
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:24,601
Leave!

813
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:31,401
Oops, whoops!

814
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:35,769
Hey. Who comes there?
Are you the police officer?

815
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:39,589
- Do you have the Madonna?
- Give me Maria, then you get it.

816
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:43,349
- I'll get it anyway.
- Where is she?

817
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:47,226
You can't hang here, can you?

818
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:53,219
No, let go. So we just say that
you gave it to me voluntarily.

819
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:55,766
Then you get the girl.

820
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:58,305
Thank you.

821
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:07,705
If I could now,
say something to you, so...

822
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:11,515
I don't bloody know, what to say.
Maria!

823
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:14,131
You should just know that...

824
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:34,522
Fuck.

825
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:03,080
Gustav!

826
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:05,242
Help!

827
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:28,156
Maria

828
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,720
Maria

829
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:34,700
Maria

830
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:40,530
- Maria!
- Gustav?

831
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:43,731
He's stuck!

832
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:47,964
He's stuck.
Under the water.

833
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:27,595
- Are you okay?
- Hold there. Like that.

834
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:34,796
Hold here.

835
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:38,826
Ouch!

836
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:48,710
It's him, Gustav.

837
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:53,220
- Well, we know each other well.
- I told you we would meet again.

838
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:59,156
I had not ever imagined,
I would be so happy about it.

839
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:01,242
(footsteps)

840
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:08,690
Give me the Madonna now.

841
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:17,445
Thank you very much.

842
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:22,361
Gustav?

843
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,516
I know you know-

844
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:29,865
-that it's just business.

845
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,706
Yes, yes.

846
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:36,658
Kurt... I'm sorry
that it has to end like this, but...

847
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:43,388
The time is 13 something, and you are
under arrest, whatever the hell your name is.

848
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:48,890
Your fucking bitch!

849
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:58,930
Is it finished now?

850
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:02,299
Yes. Now it's finished.

851
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:20,173
I have read your report,
and I have just one simple question.

852
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:23,625
When I suspended you,
was it an invitation-

853
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:28,299
-to go to war with the Russian
mafia, or to stay at home?

854
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:32,894
- Yes, it was really a little stupid.
- Yes, you just don't do it again.

855
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,925
And don't shoot anymore
with stainless steel nails, right?

856
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:40,146
It was a shame with Kurt Hartmann.

857
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:43,625
Yes, it was a pity he got away.

858
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:45,546
Yes...

859
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:50,854
- Kurt's daughter will get the reward, right?
- I don't know.

860
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:54,748
Yes, she certainly will. Yes.

861
01:21:54,880 --> 01:22:00,637
Gustav! I received a bill for a Cessna light
aircraft. Do you know anything about it?

862
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:05,180
It was reported as a total loss.
Gustav?

863
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:21,282
(church bells)

864
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:32,391
(organ music)

865
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:35,176
They are very good as well.

866
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:39,616
Well.
I don't really know, you know.

867
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:49,009
Dad, shouldn't you do something else now?

868
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:52,106
No, now shall we both
be properly together.

869
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:57,428
We don't need to be together the
whole time. You can look around.

870
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:02,059
- We can look at it together. Come.
- No, dad. Will you do me a favor?

871
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:04,401
Yes, of course.

872
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:08,428
- Would you bother to go?
- What?

873
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:11,051
(footsteps)

874
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:18,009
- Well... Not a problem.
- Good.

875
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:22,235
(breathe in)

876
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:33,394
You're doing that again.
You're holding your breath.

877
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:37,115
- I'm not doing that.
- You are so fucking annoying.

878
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:40,676
Strange,
you don't get better at cursing.

879
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:43,576
You're really bad at it.

880
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:47,760
Just breathe.

881
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:55,252
- It's because I'm concentrating.
- Don't hold your breath. Breathe out.

882
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:57,891
Talk, talk, talk, talk...

883
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:07,545
What are you concentrating on now?

884
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:09,466
You.

885
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:14,726
- Me?
- Yes, you.

886
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:19,508
- Is it good?
- Yes, I think it is.

887
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:29,625
(alarm)

888
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:34,988
- What the hell is happening?
- Motherfucker-pissing shit-fucking ass, man.

889
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:38,762
(alarm)

890
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:49,686
(speaking over the radio)
