1
00:03:00,021 --> 00:03:01,454
Ma.

2
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,159
I'm going now, Ma.

3
00:03:07,295 --> 00:03:10,662
When the child is born,
I'll bring it for your blessing.

4
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:13,929
God prevent you having a daughter.

5
00:03:17,538 --> 00:03:19,130
I'll be back, Ma.

6
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,902
One day I'll come back.

7
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,679
Don't bother.

8
00:07:41,202 --> 00:07:45,104
- Long time no see.
- You're telling me.

9
00:07:48,075 --> 00:07:49,667
This is Dimas.

10
00:08:36,757 --> 00:08:38,190
Hi, Mr. Linhares.

11
00:08:40,361 --> 00:08:42,625
Sweeping the floor of our house?

12
00:08:44,999 --> 00:08:48,491
Nice place you've got, Mr. Linhares.

13
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,764
Been doing well for yourself!.

14
00:08:50,838 --> 00:08:53,272
Piling up all that wealth
all these years.

15
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,167
You came back?

16
00:08:55,242 --> 00:08:58,006
No, Mr. Linhares,
I'm still there.

17
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:02,675
This here's my ghost. Me, my flesh
and bones, are away in the city.

18
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,944
- Off already?
- Yeah.

19
00:09:04,018 --> 00:09:07,078
I'm taking the boy
for his grandmother's blessing.

20
00:09:08,155 --> 00:09:09,622
See you soon.

21
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:19,418
So heavy!
What the hell's in it?

22
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:22,724
Old junk. Might need something.

23
00:10:24,198 --> 00:10:25,859
Put it here, on the stove.

24
00:10:25,933 --> 00:10:27,867
Won't it get scratched?

25
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:32,871
Nice new house like this,
and all this old junk.

26
00:10:34,642 --> 00:10:37,941
Put that in my room,
the one in the back. It's my hammock.

27
00:11:36,937 --> 00:11:41,271
Get a bit of fresh air.
That's better.

28
00:11:41,342 --> 00:11:44,038
Osias could take Mother
to live with him.

29
00:11:44,111 --> 00:11:47,342
Osias doesn't know
how to take care of her.

30
00:11:47,414 --> 00:11:49,882
Unless he took me along.

31
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,919
But he hasn't invited me,
and it doesn't look like he's going to.

32
00:11:52,987 --> 00:11:55,046
And leave me here alone?

33
00:11:55,122 --> 00:11:57,352
- Be right back.
- What the hell, Osias!

34
00:11:57,424 --> 00:11:59,153
Why are you dressed like that?

35
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,097
Let's sleep a bit now, Dimas.

36
00:12:35,229 --> 00:12:39,563
Jesus, Mr. Linhares, you scared me!
Going around frightening people.

37
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,800
Getting married, Mr. Linhares?

38
00:12:44,905 --> 00:12:46,497
I could build faster.

39
00:12:48,776 --> 00:12:50,937
If you like, the house is yours.

40
00:12:51,011 --> 00:12:55,311
As far as I'm concerned,
it's a deal. What's your answer?

41
00:12:55,382 --> 00:12:57,441
- Answer to what?
- You liked the house, didn'tyou?

42
00:12:57,518 --> 00:13:00,544
If you marry me,
the house is as good as yours.

43
00:13:01,622 --> 00:13:04,989
You misunderstood me.
I was only kidding.

44
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:07,926
-Just a joke, Mr. Linhares.
- I don't see what's funny.

45
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,188
Marry me.

46
00:13:11,265 --> 00:13:15,224
I like you, you're pretty,
I like your ways.

47
00:13:15,302 --> 00:13:16,701
But pretty soon you'll be old.

48
00:13:17,438 --> 00:13:20,066
You've already got the boy,
no father.

49
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,835
That's none of your business.

50
00:13:21,909 --> 00:13:24,173
But you've no place of your own.

51
00:13:24,244 --> 00:13:29,079
I've a house and animals for the boy,
for you and all the other children.

52
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:31,014
Other children?

53
00:13:31,085 --> 00:13:34,248
You got one on your own,
didn't you?

54
00:13:34,321 --> 00:13:35,686
Marry me.

55
00:13:35,756 --> 00:13:38,452
As far as I'm concerned,
it's a deal.

56
00:13:40,794 --> 00:13:42,193
- Tomorrow.
- No, not tomorrow.

57
00:13:42,262 --> 00:13:44,560
The house won't be ready yet.

58
00:13:44,631 --> 00:13:46,929
No, tomorrow I'll give you an answer.

59
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,359
I don't go around smiling
at just anyone, you know.

60
00:15:03,243 --> 00:15:07,236
Hey, Osias! What's wrong
with the door? It's stuck.

61
00:15:07,314 --> 00:15:10,772
It'd be stranger if it opened.
I locked it from the inside.

62
00:15:10,851 --> 00:15:14,287
Open the door.
I want to put away the presents.

63
00:15:14,354 --> 00:15:17,812
No way. I don't want
any strangers in my house.

64
00:15:17,891 --> 00:15:21,554
Have you gone mad? I thought
you said the house was mine.

65
00:15:21,628 --> 00:15:25,462
The house was in exchange for
getting married. But now you're mine.

66
00:15:25,532 --> 00:15:28,729
The house is mine again
and stays locked.

67
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:31,828
- What are you talking about?
- Don't worry about it.

68
00:15:31,905 --> 00:15:34,567
Let's just find a way
to break up the party.

69
00:15:34,641 --> 00:15:38,236
This racket is keeping
my goats awake.

70
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:42,544
Who gives a damn about the goats?
Go and dance!

71
00:15:42,616 --> 00:15:45,744
It's as if you were nailed
to that chair. Get up!

72
00:15:49,723 --> 00:15:51,315
Shall we dance, Zezinho?

73
00:15:52,392 --> 00:15:54,485
I've never danced
with a lady before.

74
00:15:54,561 --> 00:15:56,756
So what have you danced with?

75
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,593
What have I danced with?

76
00:15:58,665 --> 00:16:01,930
I've never danced with anything,
not with a woman nor anything else.

77
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,368
Doesn't matter.
I'll dance for both of us.

78
00:16:04,438 --> 00:16:07,339
Zezinho has bad legs.

79
00:16:07,407 --> 00:16:09,398
Yeah, my legs aren't too good.

80
00:16:09,476 --> 00:16:13,242
But mine are both great.
Don't be scared, Zezinho. Come on.

81
00:16:13,313 --> 00:16:15,281
Just follow me. I'll lead.

82
00:16:27,494 --> 00:16:29,291
This thought goes out to you...

83
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:32,196
my dear friend and faithful brother
all these years...

84
00:16:32,266 --> 00:16:33,961
my listener, Carlos Tenio.

85
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:37,367
Tenio, overat
the Texaco gas station...

86
00:16:37,437 --> 00:16:41,464
where you had the joy to watch
your first grandson be born.

87
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,100
Congratulations from all of us
on the program.

88
00:16:43,176 --> 00:16:45,041
May God givehealth,
my brother Tenio...

89
00:16:45,112 --> 00:16:48,878
to you and your grandson...

90
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:51,884
and may there
be many others to follow.

91
00:16:51,952 --> 00:16:57,447
Hold on. Hang in there.
I know it's been difficult for you.

92
00:16:57,524 --> 00:16:59,992
But I'll stop by
to greet you personally...

93
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,325
and for now, I send you
this song from the program.

94
00:18:58,645 --> 00:19:01,705
Darlene!
Get me something to eat.

95
00:19:01,782 --> 00:19:04,342
I haven't eaten since breakfast.
My belly's hurting.

96
00:19:05,485 --> 00:19:09,421
And another thing, woman,
there's hardly any water.

97
00:19:09,489 --> 00:19:13,152
You'll have to go and get water
from the water hole. Go!

98
00:19:16,263 --> 00:19:18,891
No, honey. Not like this.
Throw farther.

99
00:19:36,016 --> 00:19:37,449
Come on.

100
00:19:40,987 --> 00:19:44,047
That female will be
giving birth soon, Ederaldo.

101
00:19:44,124 --> 00:19:46,251
You're getting two
for the price of one.

102
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:50,319
She really is very heavy.

103
00:19:51,298 --> 00:19:53,425
That's not very manly of you.

104
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,661
Every man has his own specialty.

105
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,203
His is the hammock.

106
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,035
It's no use.

107
00:19:59,106 --> 00:20:01,472
Osias doesn't get out of that hammock
for anything. He was born to be king.

108
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:06,274
I don't get up
because I can do my job lying down.

109
00:20:06,346 --> 00:20:09,247
With a woman spoiling me like that...

110
00:20:09,316 --> 00:20:11,682
I wouldn't get up either.

111
00:20:12,686 --> 00:20:14,586
All right,
we'll have to do it ourselves.

112
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:18,023
Careful not to hurt her kid.

113
00:21:02,068 --> 00:21:03,501
Dimas.

114
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,537
Will you like if I have a baby,
having a brother?

115
00:21:10,677 --> 00:21:12,110
Yeah.

116
00:21:13,547 --> 00:21:16,573
Is it going to be a boy or a girl?

117
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,083
Boy.

118
00:21:21,521 --> 00:21:23,853
Who do you think he'll look like?

119
00:21:26,092 --> 00:21:27,525
Like me.

120
00:21:35,969 --> 00:21:37,869
Have you named it?

121
00:21:37,938 --> 00:21:39,667
Edinardo.

122
00:21:39,739 --> 00:21:41,366
After the singer?

123
00:21:41,441 --> 00:21:45,002
I don't know. Was it the singer
you got the name from, Osias?

124
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,749
What are you frowning
like that for?

125
00:21:51,818 --> 00:21:54,378
All these years nagging me
about a kid.

126
00:21:54,454 --> 00:21:56,388
And now the boy's here--

127
00:21:57,924 --> 00:22:00,119
Black like that's no good.

128
00:22:01,027 --> 00:22:03,689
The boy really is very black.

129
00:22:05,298 --> 00:22:06,697
Don't worry. He'll lighten up.

130
00:22:06,766 --> 00:22:09,360
He's black like that from the effort
of being born with no help.

131
00:22:58,718 --> 00:23:00,811
Jose Pereira de Lacerda.

132
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:05,617
Marilene Moreira da Silva.

133
00:23:08,561 --> 00:23:10,324
Francelina de Jesus.

134
00:23:14,701 --> 00:23:16,362
Claudio Alves Leonel.

135
00:23:23,176 --> 00:23:25,644
Gabriel Francisco dos Santos.

136
00:23:31,351 --> 00:23:33,216
Darlene Lima Linhares.

137
00:23:38,858 --> 00:23:40,792
Maria Lucia Serafim.

138
00:24:04,084 --> 00:24:06,348
Go put these beans away
in the kitchen.

139
00:24:11,358 --> 00:24:13,826
The harvest is over.

140
00:24:13,893 --> 00:24:16,384
And that's not even half
what they owe.

141
00:24:19,399 --> 00:24:22,334
Osias! Are you going to get up,
or just watch everything fall apart?

142
00:24:40,587 --> 00:24:44,079
Ma, let's go and get water.

143
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:38,040
- Don't do that.
- It's no good, son.

144
00:25:38,878 --> 00:25:40,470
The water's no good.

145
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:45,782
Not the water
nor anything else around here.

146
00:25:54,494 --> 00:25:55,927
Come on.

147
00:26:05,472 --> 00:26:08,930
Near Russas the body was found...

148
00:26:09,008 --> 00:26:10,942
of a young woman shot dead.

149
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:14,969
The girl wasn't even 20,
and the way she was killed...

150
00:26:15,048 --> 00:26:17,107
suggests she was
a colonel's lover...

151
00:26:17,183 --> 00:26:20,641
ordered to be killed
by the legitimate wife.

152
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,087
I heard this
from my friend Eraldo...

153
00:26:24,157 --> 00:26:26,648
driver on
the Juazeiro-Maciroca line...

154
00:26:26,726 --> 00:26:30,389
who was unfortunate enough to
pass the scene of the crime--

155
00:26:57,624 --> 00:26:59,216
Let's go. Come on.

156
00:27:05,732 --> 00:27:07,324
Zezinho!

157
00:27:08,067 --> 00:27:09,466
Zezinho!

158
00:27:09,536 --> 00:27:11,527
You actually got up?

159
00:27:11,604 --> 00:27:14,437
No way you'll reach Darlene
on the back of a donkey.

160
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:16,099
Come out here, Zezinho.

161
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:20,108
- Where did she go?
- To Fazenda do Brejinho.

162
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,114
If you hurry,
you'll catch her halfway.

163
00:27:40,767 --> 00:27:45,898
Go with your father. You'll get
used to him. You'll learn to like him.

164
00:27:53,613 --> 00:27:55,046
Go on.

165
00:27:57,684 --> 00:27:59,117
Move.

166
00:28:03,156 --> 00:28:04,748
Do as I say.

167
00:30:14,587 --> 00:30:16,521
Thank God, you're back.

168
00:30:22,462 --> 00:30:23,895
Dimas stayed.

169
00:30:25,932 --> 00:30:28,230
Dimas stayed behind.

170
00:30:28,301 --> 00:30:32,237
But isn't that what you wanted?
He's with the colonel.

171
00:30:32,305 --> 00:30:36,765
The boy will study. There was
no other way, was there, honey?

172
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,983
My son, my little boy.

173
00:30:50,623 --> 00:30:52,454
My baby boy.

174
00:30:52,525 --> 00:30:55,289
Dimas will go to the city.

175
00:30:55,361 --> 00:30:57,659
He'll have a better life.

176
00:31:28,561 --> 00:31:30,529
Where's Zezinho?

177
00:31:30,596 --> 00:31:32,188
In the bedroom.

178
00:31:43,609 --> 00:31:44,871
I made some fudge.

179
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:49,608
Look, Auntie, a present from Darlene.
She made it herself.

180
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,284
Wait a minute.
It's still a bit hot.

181
00:31:55,521 --> 00:31:57,580
You're looking very pretty, cousin.

182
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:03,420
A little beauty's good
for hiding sadness.

183
00:32:06,933 --> 00:32:09,561
Just a taste
to make you strong, Aunt.

184
00:32:10,636 --> 00:32:13,070
Lift her up a little more, Zezinho.

185
00:32:14,373 --> 00:32:17,672
Don't worry. I'll look after her.
You can go now, Darlene.

186
00:32:19,378 --> 00:32:21,812
I know there's a dance tonight.

187
00:32:21,881 --> 00:32:23,508
I wasn't even thinking of going.

188
00:32:24,584 --> 00:32:26,984
Osias doesn't mind you going,
does he?

189
00:32:27,053 --> 00:32:29,851
Osias! Why should he mind?

190
00:32:31,924 --> 00:32:34,222
I should never have come back.

191
00:32:35,127 --> 00:32:37,061
So go to the dance, Darlene.

192
00:32:40,233 --> 00:32:41,996
Come to the dance with me, Zezinho.

193
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:47,430
For the love of God! If I go home,
I'll only skin the old man alive.

194
00:33:26,946 --> 00:33:30,404
- Dance with me?
- No, thanks.

195
00:33:30,483 --> 00:33:33,043
-Just one.
- I'm with someone.

196
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:35,246
Well, excuse me, then.

197
00:33:35,321 --> 00:33:36,754
Of course.

198
00:33:48,734 --> 00:33:50,326
Want to dance, honey?

199
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:58,010
- Let's dance.
- Okay.

200
00:34:51,731 --> 00:34:55,292
- I guess we could stop now.
- Want to go?

201
00:34:55,368 --> 00:34:57,302
- Don'tyou want to?
- Let's go.

202
00:36:03,569 --> 00:36:06,436
Darlene! Darlene!

203
00:36:06,505 --> 00:36:08,803
The clothes are floating away!

204
00:36:11,143 --> 00:36:13,441
Got it! I got one!

205
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:20,147
They were all floating away!

206
00:36:33,866 --> 00:36:35,458
I'll get that one.

207
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,169
Come on out, Zezinho.

208
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:40,467
- I got them all.
- You'll drown.

209
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,701
I saved your clothes.

210
00:36:51,016 --> 00:36:52,608
I slipped.

211
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,654
I got them all.

212
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:06,222
I saved your clothes.

213
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,702
You're soaking wet.

214
00:37:21,514 --> 00:37:23,448
Come on. Get that wet shirt off.

215
00:37:42,701 --> 00:37:44,635
You smell so good.

216
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,297
Only now you arrive!

217
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:43,620
Christ has risen.

218
00:38:56,008 --> 00:38:57,669
Come on in, Zezinho.

219
00:38:58,944 --> 00:39:03,472
Darlene, Raquel threw Zezinho out.
Now he lives with us.

220
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:41,010
- Bye.
- Bye.

221
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,873
How come it's so damn hot,
Zezinho?

222
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,877
It has to be, cousin.

223
00:40:07,212 --> 00:40:09,476
- Haven't you ever been to the barber's?
- No.

224
00:40:10,549 --> 00:40:11,982
You should.

225
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,350
When you go to town
for your pension...

226
00:40:18,424 --> 00:40:21,222
you should go to the barber's.

227
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:23,386
You'll see how good it is.

228
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:25,555
You think I go to town?

229
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:27,565
Darlene gets the pension.

230
00:40:30,769 --> 00:40:32,794
And does she do the accounts?

231
00:40:32,871 --> 00:40:34,463
It certainly isn't me.

232
00:40:36,542 --> 00:40:39,136
She works hard in the field...

233
00:40:39,211 --> 00:40:41,145
does the housework...

234
00:40:43,549 --> 00:40:45,915
and now with me to look after.

235
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:49,352
She's still young.
She can handle it.

236
00:40:49,421 --> 00:40:51,355
But she's a woman.

237
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,153
We're the ones
who should be in the field.

238
00:40:56,795 --> 00:41:00,390
She doesn't mind,
a strong squaw like that.

239
00:41:00,466 --> 00:41:02,400
The work does her good.

240
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:10,738
Now they're back working the fields.
I should sign up.

241
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:15,846
It's not right,
me being a burden to her.

242
00:41:15,914 --> 00:41:18,883
She doesn't mind.
And this house is mine.

243
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:27,959
Did you know I was the one
who cooked at your mother's house?

244
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:31,554
Look, Raquel is my sister,
but I won't stand up for her.

245
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:34,121
She was always damned lazy.

246
00:41:35,634 --> 00:41:38,296
She never even gave Zuza a kid,
did she?

247
00:41:40,606 --> 00:41:45,009
Then she even had the nerve
to say that you and she...

248
00:41:45,077 --> 00:41:48,103
living alone without the mother
would raise suspicions!

249
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:51,115
As if anyone could even
look twice at her.

250
00:41:51,183 --> 00:41:53,777
If Zuza did,
it was only out of charity.

251
00:41:56,688 --> 00:42:00,215
She sure is ugly,
that sister of yours, cousin.

252
00:42:00,292 --> 00:42:01,554
Was she always?

253
00:42:01,627 --> 00:42:03,561
She was born ugly.

254
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:12,637
If you like...

255
00:42:14,706 --> 00:42:16,799
I can cook for us.

256
00:42:19,478 --> 00:42:21,378
Sounds good.

257
00:42:21,447 --> 00:42:22,914
Great idea.

258
00:42:24,116 --> 00:42:26,482
Because Darlene's food stinks.

259
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:30,521
I only eat it
because I have no choice.

260
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,182
That's settled, then.

261
00:42:35,027 --> 00:42:36,927
I'd like that.

262
00:42:36,995 --> 00:42:38,428
It's a deal.

263
00:42:47,139 --> 00:42:50,006
Now I've brought my bike...

264
00:42:50,075 --> 00:42:53,567
I can take lunch
to Darlene in the field.

265
00:42:53,645 --> 00:42:56,512
All that way?
She takes it with her.

266
00:42:57,883 --> 00:43:00,784
- But she eats it cold, cousin.
- All right, do as you like.

267
00:43:00,853 --> 00:43:03,788
But let me tell you something:
Watch out for Darlene.

268
00:43:03,856 --> 00:43:05,790
She just loves ordering men around.

269
00:43:06,892 --> 00:43:11,226
If I'd been soft, I'd have been crawling
around on all fours a long time ago.

270
00:43:13,165 --> 00:43:14,962
Now look.

271
00:43:22,007 --> 00:43:24,441
- Very nice, isn't it?
- Very.

272
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:20,029
I'll never get used to sleeping
under this roof.

273
00:44:25,304 --> 00:44:27,295
- Come.
- It's not right.

274
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:56,792
You're the best.

275
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:03,807
See if you like it.

276
00:45:03,875 --> 00:45:05,467
Where's that spoon gone?

277
00:45:20,225 --> 00:45:22,193
Osias, where's Zezinho?

278
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:27,198
Zezinho came back from the field
and went to the water hole.

279
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:29,826
He takes Darlene's lunch every day,
does he?

280
00:45:29,901 --> 00:45:34,099
Yes, every day. If he didn't have
that bike I doubt he'd do all his work.

281
00:45:34,172 --> 00:45:37,369
He arrived from the field and went to
the water hole with a bundle of clothes.

282
00:45:37,442 --> 00:45:40,002
But he must be back soon.

283
00:45:40,078 --> 00:45:41,978
Well, now you've a son and two wives.

284
00:45:42,047 --> 00:45:43,708
One in the field and one at home.

285
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:47,445
That's exactly right.
Zezinho does everything.

286
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:50,147
He washes, cooks, sweeps...

287
00:45:50,222 --> 00:45:53,191
brings me coffee all the time--
He even makes a damn good cake.

288
00:45:53,258 --> 00:45:57,285
Things couldn't be better,
no comparison to Darlene. Much better!

289
00:45:57,362 --> 00:45:58,556
I did you a favor.

290
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:01,463
If it weren't for people talking,
I'd have kept him at my place.

291
00:46:01,533 --> 00:46:03,592
I didn't see anything wrong
in it, Raquel.

292
00:46:03,669 --> 00:46:05,967
Honestly!

293
00:46:06,038 --> 00:46:08,006
Zezinho is your cousin...

294
00:46:08,073 --> 00:46:11,406
and besides, he may be a man,
but he's not much of one.

295
00:46:29,561 --> 00:46:32,689
That spring has lost its strength.

296
00:46:34,433 --> 00:46:35,923
It doesn't fit anymore.

297
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:38,492
The cross goes there and the line--

298
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:41,539
That's what I'm doing!
It just won't fit.

299
00:46:41,606 --> 00:46:42,766
There are two colors.

300
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:46,436
It's stuck. That boy's
been fiddling with the radio...

301
00:46:46,511 --> 00:46:48,445
and now it won't fit.

302
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:53,082
Zezinho, go spread some salt.

303
00:46:54,419 --> 00:46:55,909
I just did it.

304
00:46:55,987 --> 00:46:57,750
So give them some water.

305
00:46:57,823 --> 00:46:59,552
I just did.

306
00:46:59,624 --> 00:47:01,592
So give them some more.

307
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:04,060
Those animals will burst
if they drink all that water.

308
00:47:04,129 --> 00:47:08,429
Zezinho, do as Darlene says!
What a fuss, so stubborn!

309
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:11,799
It's a waste of water,
but I'll do it.

310
00:47:14,272 --> 00:47:16,536
There, it won't fit.

311
00:47:16,608 --> 00:47:18,269
It's gone bad.

312
00:47:18,343 --> 00:47:23,406
No, it hasn't. You think I don't know
when a battery's gone bad?

313
00:47:23,482 --> 00:47:24,779
Wake up, Osias.

314
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:28,684
What do you mean, wake up?
It's always worked fine...

315
00:47:28,754 --> 00:47:30,984
and I've had this radio
since before you came here.

316
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:35,823
And it's always worked fine. It's been
like this ever since that boy came!

317
00:47:45,637 --> 00:47:47,628
Didn't I tell you
I'd already given them water?

318
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,106
Look at the size
of that one's belly.

319
00:47:51,176 --> 00:47:53,303
Look at her.

320
00:47:53,378 --> 00:47:55,312
A beauty, isn't she?

321
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:57,974
Be having her kids soon now,
won't she?

322
00:47:58,049 --> 00:47:59,243
Both o us will.

323
00:47:59,317 --> 00:48:01,683
Might even be born
at the same time.

324
00:48:03,555 --> 00:48:06,353
I'm pregnant, and it's yours.

325
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:11,194
Mine?

326
00:48:12,531 --> 00:48:16,763
It can't be!
It must be Osias'.

327
00:48:16,835 --> 00:48:18,268
Osias?

328
00:48:18,336 --> 00:48:21,271
He's of the same stock as Raquel.
He wouldn't know where to start.

329
00:48:22,674 --> 00:48:24,608
I'm sure it's yours.

330
00:48:40,725 --> 00:48:42,158
A boy!

331
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:49,232
A kid of mine?

332
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:51,735
Didn't you know
that's how you got kids?

333
00:48:53,705 --> 00:48:56,936
Darlene, a boy of mine?

334
00:48:57,209 --> 00:48:59,507
Mama's little boy.

335
00:48:59,578 --> 00:49:02,138
Blue little eyes, aren't they?

336
00:49:02,214 --> 00:49:04,239
Goodness me...

337
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:06,216
Osias must be very proud.

338
00:49:06,284 --> 00:49:09,412
And so he should be.
Sky blue, as pretty as can be.

339
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:13,356
We'll have to bless him,
to keep away the devil eye.

340
00:49:13,425 --> 00:49:15,620
- He's like an angel.
- Does the angel have a name?

341
00:49:15,694 --> 00:49:17,252
Edinaldo.

342
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:18,387
Like the other one?

343
00:49:19,564 --> 00:49:23,523
I'm glad it's like his brother's.
Edinaldo and Edinardo de Lima Linhares.

344
00:49:23,602 --> 00:49:27,333
Darlene's very lucky,
one boy after another.

345
00:49:27,405 --> 00:49:29,771
I was married for over 40 years...

346
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:33,106
but I've no son to carry my coffin.

347
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:34,702
Who knows, there's still time.

348
00:49:34,779 --> 00:49:39,546
I won't bring another man into my house.
One husband's enough for this life.

349
00:49:39,618 --> 00:49:41,779
See?

350
00:49:59,437 --> 00:50:02,600
- Get up! Not you, her!
- Me?

351
00:50:02,674 --> 00:50:05,507
- You're moving into the other room.
- What the hell for, man?

352
00:50:05,577 --> 00:50:08,569
Because I say so. Hurry, oryou
and the boy will end up on the floor.

353
00:50:08,647 --> 00:50:10,615
- What's going on, Osias?
- What is it, Osias?

354
00:50:10,682 --> 00:50:14,049
- Leave Darlene alone!
- Shut up!

355
00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:16,178
I'm the one in charge of Darlene!

356
00:50:16,254 --> 00:50:19,553
And don't forget to obey me either,
since you're only here as a favor.

357
00:50:19,624 --> 00:50:22,252
But you invited me.
I'll leave, if that's what you want.

358
00:50:22,327 --> 00:50:24,352
No, I want you where
I can keep an eye on you.

359
00:50:24,429 --> 00:50:27,023
Bring your hammock. From now on,
you sleep in here with me.

360
00:50:27,098 --> 00:50:31,034
And you, hurry up!
I want to get to bed!

361
00:50:32,971 --> 00:50:36,702
And if that child starts whining
in the night, you get the hell out.

362
00:50:36,775 --> 00:50:39,744
I can't stand noisy kids!

363
00:51:31,563 --> 00:51:33,155
All right, finished.

364
00:51:37,936 --> 00:51:41,064
Very good.
Who's my sweetie?

365
00:51:41,873 --> 00:51:44,842
The kids' food is ready.

366
00:51:44,909 --> 00:51:47,070
Who's my sweetie?

367
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:50,046
Bring those kids in to eat!

368
00:51:50,115 --> 00:51:52,640
Let's go, kid.
Your father's calling.

369
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,648
- Where's Edinaldo?
- Go and get him.

370
00:51:58,723 --> 00:52:01,055
Hurry.
I want to go to the dance.

371
00:52:02,427 --> 00:52:04,019
Sit down, Edinardo.

372
00:52:13,371 --> 00:52:15,236
Let's go, Zezinho!

373
00:52:15,306 --> 00:52:17,240
All right, honey.

374
00:52:19,611 --> 00:52:21,579
You both going?

375
00:52:21,646 --> 00:52:23,409
What's this, Osias?

376
00:52:23,481 --> 00:52:26,473
- Since when do you go to the dance?
- Since whenever I feel like it.

377
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,705
Want to dance, Zezinho?

378
00:52:57,449 --> 00:52:59,383
No, thanks, honey.

379
00:52:59,451 --> 00:53:02,511
I'll just stay here
keeping my cousin company.

380
00:53:02,587 --> 00:53:06,216
I don't need company.
What I need is some liquor!

381
00:53:08,326 --> 00:53:11,227
Osias told me
to get the liquor money.

382
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:14,264
Two.

383
00:54:26,871 --> 00:54:28,202
And you...

384
00:54:29,274 --> 00:54:30,571
aren'tyou going to dance?

385
00:54:31,242 --> 00:54:33,335
Sitting or standing
is the same price.

386
00:54:33,411 --> 00:54:35,845
Excuse me,
but I was just about to leave.

387
00:54:35,914 --> 00:54:38,883
But I'm asking.
You can't refuse a lady.

388
00:54:39,984 --> 00:54:43,784
The next time
I'll ask you with pleasure.

389
00:54:43,855 --> 00:54:46,415
But I really was just leaving.

390
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:50,589
Good night, ma'am.

391
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:32,631
It's hard work, Ciro. From 6:00 to 5:00
with half an hour for lunch.

392
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:34,638
Did you bring your tools?

393
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:37,641
So get to work.

394
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:38,095
Do you live down in Russas?

395
00:56:38,169 --> 00:56:40,160
I haven't a place yet, ma'am.

396
00:56:45,343 --> 00:56:47,277
So where do you sleep?

397
00:56:48,513 --> 00:56:50,447
For the moment I just sleep rough.

398
00:56:55,653 --> 00:57:00,056
But now you've got a job.
You'll get somewhere proper, right?

399
00:57:00,124 --> 00:57:02,058
Do you know of anywhere?

400
00:57:05,063 --> 00:57:07,930
In Russas you'll probably find a family
who'll put you up.

401
00:57:07,999 --> 00:57:11,935
But Russas is so far.
Too far to come every day.

402
00:57:12,003 --> 00:57:15,268
- That's true, much too far.
- Hell of a long way.

403
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:25,180
What was your name?

404
00:57:25,249 --> 00:57:26,910
Ciro.

405
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:28,748
And yours?

406
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,754
Darlene de Lima Linhares.

407
00:57:43,868 --> 00:57:45,597
Hello there!

408
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:48,002
I took you up on your offer.

409
00:57:49,173 --> 00:57:50,265
Come on in.

410
00:57:51,976 --> 00:57:55,002
Good evening, sir. I work
with your wife out in the field.

411
00:57:56,681 --> 00:58:01,675
He just arrived
and has no place to stay.

412
00:58:01,753 --> 00:58:03,983
So I invited him to eat with us.

413
00:58:04,055 --> 00:58:06,785
It so happens
that the place is full.

414
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:09,554
More mouths to feed
than pots to fill.

415
00:58:09,627 --> 00:58:14,530
I'm sorry. It was your wife who offered.
I wouldn't want to disturb anyone.

416
00:58:14,599 --> 00:58:17,466
It's just that my wife's heart
is greater than her possessions.

417
00:58:17,535 --> 00:58:18,729
What's going on, Zezinho?

418
00:58:20,238 --> 00:58:24,038
I was just explaining to this gentleman,
who's new around here...

419
00:58:24,108 --> 00:58:26,235
I was explaining
that the house is full.

420
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:28,574
No problem. Please excuse me.
You too, ma'am.

421
00:58:28,646 --> 00:58:31,479
Well, you explained wrong.

422
00:58:31,549 --> 00:58:35,747
The house is mine and so is the wife,
and you stay!

423
00:58:36,821 --> 00:58:37,845
Osias Linhares.

424
00:58:37,922 --> 00:58:40,322
- Ciro Antunes.
- Come inside.

425
00:58:41,125 --> 00:58:45,061
That's Osias, my husband.
Come on in, please.

426
00:58:58,242 --> 00:59:00,904
It's a big house.

427
00:59:00,978 --> 00:59:04,436
No shortage of hammock hooks,
right, Darlene?

428
00:59:06,818 --> 00:59:09,343
- If you say so.
- Excuse me.

429
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:12,878
Make yourself at home. There are always
plenty of people around.

430
00:59:12,957 --> 00:59:15,425
Darlene doesn't mind.
She even likes it, don't you, honey?

431
00:59:15,493 --> 00:59:18,291
- I only invited him to eat.
- I don't want to get in the way.

432
00:59:18,362 --> 00:59:20,887
I bought this,
and I can cook it myself.

433
00:59:20,965 --> 00:59:23,024
Great, let's see what you've got here.

434
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:26,593
There's enough for a banquet here.

435
00:59:27,805 --> 00:59:29,204
Get cooking.

436
00:59:29,273 --> 00:59:31,264
- Who, me?
- Who do you think?

437
01:00:11,716 --> 01:00:14,276
You can stay the night.

438
01:00:14,352 --> 01:00:16,820
That won't be necessary,
thank you.

439
01:00:16,888 --> 01:00:21,689
We've eaten your food. I'm offering
you a hammock for the night.

440
01:00:21,759 --> 01:00:24,353
I hope you'll do me
the favor of accepting.

441
01:00:39,577 --> 01:00:41,602
It's his house.

442
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:45,012
If he's inviting you,
you can accept, no problem.

443
01:01:13,978 --> 01:01:18,642
Darlene, come and lie down.

444
01:01:20,117 --> 01:01:23,177
Mr. Antunes, this is your hammock.

445
01:01:23,254 --> 01:01:26,052
You'll please sleep in this room...

446
01:01:26,123 --> 01:01:28,387
with my cousin and my boys.

447
01:01:28,459 --> 01:01:30,086
- Most grateful.
- Sleep well.

448
01:02:15,206 --> 01:02:17,606
Come sleep with Daddy...

449
01:02:19,777 --> 01:02:21,210
son.

450
01:03:00,518 --> 01:03:04,511
She already left, alone, because
she knows the way perfectly well.

451
01:04:03,514 --> 01:04:05,141
What are you doing, Zezinho?

452
01:04:09,186 --> 01:04:12,553
What's up, Zezinho?
Have a bad night, did you?

453
01:04:12,623 --> 01:04:15,558
Well, I slept like a baby.

454
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:20,163
Want one of his biscuits?

455
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:25,768
What an idea, Osias,
bringing a single man into the house!

456
01:04:25,836 --> 01:04:29,067
But I brought you in,
or are you married by any chance?

457
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:31,608
- That's different, isn't it?
- Is it?

458
01:04:31,675 --> 01:04:34,143
I can't see the difference.

459
01:04:34,211 --> 01:04:36,372
I'm family.

460
01:04:36,447 --> 01:04:41,475
We don't even know where he's from,
a stranger, a young guy.

461
01:04:42,987 --> 01:04:45,751
What's wrong, Zezinho?
You think he's good-looking, doyou?

462
01:04:46,490 --> 01:04:48,981
He certainly is well-built!

463
01:04:49,059 --> 01:04:50,993
People will start talking, Osias.

464
01:04:51,061 --> 01:04:53,222
About what?

465
01:04:53,297 --> 01:04:55,595
What will they talk about?

466
01:04:55,666 --> 01:04:58,100
What will people have to say?

467
01:04:58,169 --> 01:05:00,137
Tell me. I'm listening.

468
01:05:01,172 --> 01:05:04,141
- You've got to get rid ofhim.
- I'm not going to!

469
01:05:04,775 --> 01:05:07,767
And this house is still mine,
and the guy stays.

470
01:05:13,517 --> 01:05:16,611
And take him his lunch too...

471
01:05:16,687 --> 01:05:18,746
since we're eating what's his.

472
01:06:25,456 --> 01:06:28,323
Gabriel, where's Darlene?

473
01:06:28,392 --> 01:06:30,360
Over there, somewhere.

474
01:06:30,427 --> 01:06:31,860
Thanks.

475
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:19,735
The man hardly even knows
the girl, and look...

476
01:07:19,810 --> 01:07:24,440
they marry and become
one single flesh and bone.

477
01:07:24,515 --> 01:07:27,484
That's how th eman
starts his family.

478
01:07:27,551 --> 01:07:31,647
A family associates itself with another
family, and makes another generation.

479
01:07:31,722 --> 01:07:34,156
And that goes on,
associating...

480
01:07:34,224 --> 01:07:37,318
and no one ever knows
where it will end.

481
01:07:37,394 --> 01:07:40,955
But for listeners who, like me,
believe in God...

482
01:07:41,031 --> 01:07:43,625
I recall the words of Christ..
''Grow and multiply!''

483
01:07:43,701 --> 01:07:46,397
Zezinho. Zezinho.

484
01:07:48,472 --> 01:07:50,497
What's happened to Zezinho?

485
01:07:50,574 --> 01:07:52,439
I don't know what's got into him.

486
01:07:52,509 --> 01:07:54,773
He came back from the field
and went to the pen...

487
01:07:54,845 --> 01:07:56,972
spent the afternoon there
with the goats.

488
01:08:00,985 --> 01:08:02,816
Good evening, Mr. Linhares, ma'am.

489
01:08:05,556 --> 01:08:07,114
Who's that?

490
01:08:07,191 --> 01:08:09,182
That's Ciro.
He's passing through.

491
01:08:58,776 --> 01:09:01,745
I came to fetch my things.
This is for you.

492
01:09:03,247 --> 01:09:04,839
You shouldn't have.

493
01:09:03,247 --> 01:09:04,839
You shouldn't have.

494
01:09:19,963 --> 01:09:22,989
Mr. Linhares, I'll be on my way.

495
01:09:23,067 --> 01:09:24,762
Thank you very much.

496
01:09:25,836 --> 01:09:27,770
What have you got there?

497
01:09:27,838 --> 01:09:29,669
Dried meat.

498
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:33,039
Go make it for us. I could do
with a nice piece of dried meat.

499
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:38,942
Get cooking. Are you deaf?
Move!

500
01:09:46,590 --> 01:09:49,024
So thank you all, Mr. Linhares.

501
01:09:49,093 --> 01:09:50,788
But where will you go?

502
01:09:50,861 --> 01:09:53,421
Have you found a better place?

503
01:09:53,497 --> 01:09:55,658
Or has someone here
treated you badly?

504
01:09:55,733 --> 01:09:58,099
If so, then tell me now.

505
01:09:58,168 --> 01:10:00,261
I just don't want to impose
on you any longer.

506
01:10:00,337 --> 01:10:02,271
In that case, you'll stay...

507
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:05,365
until you find something better.

508
01:10:05,442 --> 01:10:08,036
And if you refuse,
I'll take it as an insult.

509
01:10:10,848 --> 01:10:12,543
- What's that?
- Quince preserve.

510
01:10:12,616 --> 01:10:14,083
Quince.

511
01:10:14,151 --> 01:10:17,086
As soon as you get better,
I'll give you some.

512
01:10:17,154 --> 01:10:19,588
You need a little sweetening up.

513
01:10:40,444 --> 01:10:42,036
What's all the noise?

514
01:10:54,424 --> 01:10:57,757
Get out ofhere. Come with your father.
You're not an animal.

515
01:10:57,828 --> 01:10:59,386
Let me play, Dad!

516
01:11:01,799 --> 01:11:03,323
Come on. It's time to go!

517
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,925
No, leave the bull, Ma!

518
01:11:06,003 --> 01:11:08,767
The bull's not here to entertain you.
The bull's got work to do.

519
01:11:13,744 --> 01:11:17,339
Kids are silly things.
To them, everything's a party.

520
01:11:18,582 --> 01:11:21,483
- Are those your only two?
- No, I had another.

521
01:11:21,552 --> 01:11:23,816
These ones are little devils.

522
01:11:28,358 --> 01:11:29,950
Thanks, Zezinho.

523
01:12:05,495 --> 01:12:06,894
Hey, you boys!

524
01:12:06,964 --> 01:12:10,229
Get those chicks out of here
or I'll boil them alive!

525
01:12:12,169 --> 01:12:14,399
The way this was built,
it should be much worse.

526
01:12:14,471 --> 01:12:18,339
That's because it was built in a hurry.
Darlene was dying to get married.

527
01:12:18,408 --> 01:12:21,900
You should've seen my mother's house.
It never needed any repairs.

528
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:26,775
But your mother's roofcame down
in the first bit ofwind.

529
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:29,944
That's just the ramblings
ofa crazy old man.

530
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:31,487
Zezinho was born with a screw loose.

531
01:12:31,555 --> 01:12:34,718
You take Zezinho out of the kitchen
and he gets all mixed-up.

532
01:12:34,791 --> 01:12:38,158
Zezinho's an old maid,
that's his problem!

533
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:48,895
Come on. Hurry!

534
01:12:49,973 --> 01:12:51,907
Hey, little one. Come here.

535
01:12:53,510 --> 01:12:55,444
I'm there. That's my seat.

536
01:13:05,055 --> 01:13:08,286
The fire is burning

537
01:13:08,358 --> 01:13:11,657
In celebration of Saint John

538
01:13:11,728 --> 01:13:14,720
The dance has started

539
01:13:14,798 --> 01:13:18,359
Let'sgo dance together

540
01:14:26,937 --> 01:14:29,497
That's why I go to her house

541
01:14:29,573 --> 01:14:32,235
To express my love for her

542
01:14:32,309 --> 01:14:34,675
She's waiting for meat the window

543
01:15:56,359 --> 01:15:57,951
Haven't you finished?

544
01:16:00,831 --> 01:16:02,264
Thanks, Darlene.

545
01:16:06,937 --> 01:16:08,529
Good night.

546
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:37,264
Why are you still wasting
your time here with me?

547
01:16:37,334 --> 01:16:38,767
What do you mean?

548
01:16:40,070 --> 01:16:43,062
You haven't been lucky
with me, have you?

549
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:45,836
You should find a woman
that suits you better.

550
01:16:45,909 --> 01:16:47,877
And what would suit me better?

551
01:16:48,945 --> 01:16:51,607
To start with,
she should be younger.

552
01:16:51,681 --> 01:16:54,309
Just being young
makes women prettier.

553
01:16:54,384 --> 01:16:56,682
A younger woman might be prettier...

554
01:16:58,188 --> 01:17:02,124
but she wouldn't know
a fraction of what you do.

555
01:17:02,192 --> 01:17:03,989
That's practice.

556
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:07,757
Me, the only woman
I ever had in life...

557
01:17:08,832 --> 01:17:10,697
was just like you said.

558
01:17:10,767 --> 01:17:12,701
That was the right woman for you.

559
01:17:13,803 --> 01:17:15,395
No, she wasn't.

560
01:17:18,842 --> 01:17:20,537
Not that you are...

561
01:17:20,610 --> 01:17:23,841
because I never imagined
getting in a line this long...

562
01:17:23,914 --> 01:17:26,280
just because ofa woman.

563
01:17:27,350 --> 01:17:28,942
Stop talking nonsense!

564
01:17:30,654 --> 01:17:33,122
Why didn't you stay with her?

565
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:34,782
She had a husband.

566
01:17:36,526 --> 01:17:38,084
And haven't I two?

567
01:17:38,161 --> 01:17:40,026
He was my cousin.

568
01:17:40,096 --> 01:17:42,291
And what are Zezinho and Osias?

569
01:17:42,365 --> 01:17:44,629
You've no shame at all, have you?

570
01:17:45,802 --> 01:17:47,167
Not of you...

571
01:17:48,238 --> 01:17:50,536
nor of the things we do together.

572
01:17:54,177 --> 01:17:56,111
If what you say is true...

573
01:17:57,180 --> 01:17:59,307
then come with me, Darlene.

574
01:17:59,382 --> 01:18:01,441
Where to?

575
01:18:02,786 --> 01:18:04,378
I'm leaving, Darlene.

576
01:18:06,656 --> 01:18:08,590
I want you to come with me.

577
01:18:54,838 --> 01:18:57,170
You've put on quite a bit of weight.

578
01:18:58,341 --> 01:19:01,936
It's taken a while, but your age
finally caught up with you.

579
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:45,948
I'd forgotten what it was like.

580
01:19:46,022 --> 01:19:50,789
I could only remember having you
in my arms in dreams.

581
01:19:53,096 --> 01:19:54,825
That's right, Zezinho.

582
01:19:56,066 --> 01:20:00,002
That's good, nice and gentle.

583
01:20:01,338 --> 01:20:03,272
I want you to ask Osias...

584
01:20:04,441 --> 01:20:06,375
to make more room...

585
01:20:08,144 --> 01:20:10,442
to build a room for Ciro.

586
01:20:18,254 --> 01:20:20,620
He wants to leave.

587
01:20:20,690 --> 01:20:23,022
Ciro wants to leave.

588
01:20:23,093 --> 01:20:24,685
About time.

589
01:20:25,862 --> 01:20:28,262
He should never have come
in the first place.

590
01:20:28,331 --> 01:20:30,595
But he wants to take me with him.

591
01:20:31,668 --> 01:20:34,262
He won't, though.
Just let him try.

592
01:20:40,810 --> 01:20:44,143
I'm expecting a baby.

593
01:20:45,315 --> 01:20:46,907
And it's his.

594
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:59,658
He doesn't know.
I haven't told him yet.

595
01:21:02,832 --> 01:21:04,390
I didn't want it.

596
01:21:04,467 --> 01:21:06,731
I didn't want any more children
in this life.

597
01:21:08,371 --> 01:21:11,807
It's almost like a punishment.

598
01:21:14,477 --> 01:21:16,741
How do you know it's his?

599
01:21:21,484 --> 01:21:24,476
It's definitely not mine,
that's for sure.

600
01:21:25,889 --> 01:21:28,517
But you've got yours,
haven't you?

601
01:21:28,591 --> 01:21:30,525
Didn't I give you a boy?

602
01:21:43,206 --> 01:21:44,798
Couldn't sleep?

603
01:21:58,021 --> 01:21:59,682
What are you doing?

604
01:21:59,756 --> 01:22:01,189
Nothing.

605
01:22:02,392 --> 01:22:03,984
I wasn't doing anything.

606
01:22:05,361 --> 01:22:07,124
I couldn't sleep.

607
01:22:09,265 --> 01:22:10,698
So hot.

608
01:22:11,768 --> 01:22:14,703
- And Zezinho?
- What about him?

609
01:22:14,771 --> 01:22:16,363
Couldn't he sleep either?

610
01:22:19,576 --> 01:22:21,510
Zezinho doesn't do anything...

611
01:22:22,779 --> 01:22:24,212
poor thing.

612
01:22:39,796 --> 01:22:41,161
Are you jealous, Ciro?

613
01:22:41,231 --> 01:22:44,291
Me,jealous of an old man like that?

614
01:22:44,367 --> 01:22:46,597
That's just the way I see it.

615
01:22:50,406 --> 01:22:53,341
Stop that, stop! Stop that!

616
01:22:53,409 --> 01:22:55,001
I will not.

617
01:22:58,248 --> 01:23:01,411
If I don't do it with you,
who am I supposed to do it with?

618
01:23:02,619 --> 01:23:04,553
Jesus, you're excited!

619
01:23:08,458 --> 01:23:10,392
I don't know what it is.

620
01:23:11,528 --> 01:23:13,792
I'm pregnant, that's why.

621
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:18,333
You're what?

622
01:23:19,435 --> 01:23:20,868
Pregnant.

623
01:23:24,674 --> 01:23:26,107
It's yours.

624
01:23:34,584 --> 01:23:36,848
I'm going to have a child, Ciro.

625
01:23:39,622 --> 01:23:41,055
You swear?

626
01:23:42,458 --> 01:23:44,619
A little child?

627
01:23:44,694 --> 01:23:46,127
Mine and yours.

628
01:23:48,197 --> 01:23:49,755
My beauty.

629
01:23:49,832 --> 01:23:51,265
Love.

630
01:24:33,943 --> 01:24:38,004
He's taking his time, for someone
who only came for the night.

631
01:24:38,081 --> 01:24:40,049
I'm going to throw him out.

632
01:24:40,116 --> 01:24:44,314
Like I said, he's alone in the world,
stayed on and became fond of the family.

633
01:24:44,387 --> 01:24:45,513
I can do without his affection.

634
01:24:45,588 --> 01:24:50,355
Especially with them only ever
getting back from work after dark.

635
01:24:50,426 --> 01:24:52,519
People will start to talk about her.

636
01:24:52,595 --> 01:24:55,655
No, they won't.
And say what?

637
01:24:55,732 --> 01:24:58,963
Who'll talk? In this end of the world,
this emptiness?

638
01:24:59,035 --> 01:25:01,162
Too empty, too dark.

639
01:25:03,106 --> 01:25:05,040
It's scary, isn't it, cousin?

640
01:25:06,142 --> 01:25:10,272
I don't like walking around
on my own.

641
01:25:10,346 --> 01:25:12,712
It scares me to death.

642
01:25:12,782 --> 01:25:15,148
But Ciro isn't scared of anything.

643
01:25:15,218 --> 01:25:16,742
And Darlene...

644
01:25:16,819 --> 01:25:19,253
she's not scared of a single thing.

645
01:25:19,322 --> 01:25:21,415
Darlene's as brave as they come.

646
01:25:22,792 --> 01:25:25,158
Which is why I've been thinking--

647
01:25:26,229 --> 01:25:29,198
You're so good at building--

648
01:25:29,265 --> 01:25:32,428
Don't you think you might
make use of that wall...

649
01:25:32,502 --> 01:25:34,436
to build a room for Ciro?

650
01:25:34,504 --> 01:25:38,770
You can use that outside wall,
facing that Umburana.

651
01:25:38,841 --> 01:25:41,105
Look, Zezinho,
we're not building a room for Ciro.

652
01:25:41,177 --> 01:25:44,112
I'm getting rid of him,
right now!

653
01:25:45,615 --> 01:25:47,879
And what if Darlene goes with him?

654
01:25:47,950 --> 01:25:49,383
What?

655
01:25:51,054 --> 01:25:53,215
Darlene is expecting Ciro's baby.

656
01:25:53,289 --> 01:25:55,689
What? What do you mean?

657
01:25:55,758 --> 01:25:57,589
He doesn't know yet.

658
01:25:58,728 --> 01:26:02,596
It was an accident.
She didn't want--

659
01:26:02,665 --> 01:26:04,860
He forced himself on her?

660
01:26:04,934 --> 01:26:07,300
I wouldn't say that.

661
01:26:09,972 --> 01:26:12,099
It was more a moment's...

662
01:26:12,175 --> 01:26:13,733
distraction.

663
01:26:13,810 --> 01:26:15,971
Distraction in a case
like this, Zezinho?

664
01:26:16,045 --> 01:26:19,208
That woman knows no shame.

665
01:26:19,282 --> 01:26:21,443
I'll throw her out at knife point.

666
01:26:21,517 --> 01:26:23,610
Both of them, with a knife!

667
01:26:24,921 --> 01:26:27,389
That won't make
anyone happy, Osias.

668
01:26:29,959 --> 01:26:32,052
Is anyone here happy?

669
01:26:32,128 --> 01:26:34,824
Look at my face and tell me
whether I'm happy.

670
01:26:35,998 --> 01:26:37,590
They want to leave.

671
01:26:38,668 --> 01:26:42,729
Throwing them out will only be doing
exactly what they want.

672
01:26:42,805 --> 01:26:44,295
So they'll leave.

673
01:26:44,373 --> 01:26:46,637
And leave right away.

674
01:26:46,709 --> 01:26:49,701
I'm not going to support
no bastard under my wing!

675
01:26:55,051 --> 01:26:57,315
We're the ones under a wing,
if any one.

676
01:26:58,588 --> 01:26:59,987
They're young.

677
01:27:00,056 --> 01:27:03,423
They're ready to start
their lives over.

678
01:27:06,429 --> 01:27:09,592
They'll leave, take the boys,
because they're hers anyway.

679
01:27:11,234 --> 01:27:13,259
And us, old fellow...

680
01:27:13,336 --> 01:27:14,769
us two...

681
01:27:18,274 --> 01:27:21,766
we'll be left leaning up
against each other...

682
01:27:24,547 --> 01:27:26,139
waiting to die.

683
01:28:22,638 --> 01:28:25,163
Ciro, Dad is building a room.

684
01:28:25,241 --> 01:28:29,905
Hey, you, stop talking nonsense
and throw some mud to help your dad.

685
01:28:29,979 --> 01:28:33,107
Osias is building a store for wood.

686
01:28:33,182 --> 01:28:36,413
- Want some help?
- We don't need any help.

687
01:28:36,485 --> 01:28:38,851
- I can take care of my own house.
- Yes, he can.

688
01:28:39,956 --> 01:28:42,686
I'm the one who needs help.
Go ahead. I'll be right there.

689
01:29:09,685 --> 01:29:11,846
That doesn't solve
the problem, Darlene.

690
01:29:13,856 --> 01:29:15,790
Just till the kid is born.

691
01:29:16,859 --> 01:29:18,292
Please.

692
01:29:20,062 --> 01:29:21,495
I swear.

693
01:29:22,832 --> 01:29:27,394
When the kid is born, I don't want to
be living under this roof.

694
01:30:51,220 --> 01:30:54,849
- You sent for me? What for?
- I didn't send for anyone.

695
01:30:54,924 --> 01:30:58,985
Help, Raquel! The boy is lying sideways.
I don't know what to do!

696
01:30:59,061 --> 01:31:01,256
Leave me out of this.

697
01:31:01,330 --> 01:31:03,389
Help, you useless cow. Go on!

698
01:31:40,269 --> 01:31:42,567
Look, Zezinho, so perfect.

699
01:32:01,690 --> 01:32:03,487
Is it a boy or girl?

700
01:32:03,559 --> 01:32:05,117
It's a boy, Osias.

701
01:32:05,194 --> 01:32:07,424
It's a little boy.

702
01:32:07,496 --> 01:32:09,828
Well, he'll be called Edivaldi.

703
01:32:09,899 --> 01:32:13,995
Good, like his brothers, very good.

704
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:16,004
Edivaldi, very good.

705
01:32:34,356 --> 01:32:35,789
Cuck old.

706
01:35:32,501 --> 01:35:34,492
Come. Come with Daddy.

707
01:35:41,443 --> 01:35:43,934
Wait in the cart. Climb in.

708
01:37:07,296 --> 01:37:08,729
Zezinho!

709
01:37:11,767 --> 01:37:12,893
The boys!

710
01:37:13,969 --> 01:37:14,901
Osias?

711
01:37:25,714 --> 01:37:27,682
I'm going to get Ciro.

712
01:37:27,750 --> 01:37:29,342
God help me!

713
01:38:03,919 --> 01:38:05,511
Good morning.

714
01:38:14,863 --> 01:38:16,797
Are you the father?

715
01:38:21,170 --> 01:38:22,831
Dimas de Lima Linhares.

716
01:38:22,905 --> 01:38:24,532
Edinardo de Lima Linhares.

717
01:38:24,606 --> 01:38:26,267
Edinaldo de Lima Linhares.

718
01:38:26,341 --> 01:38:28,309
Edivaldi de Lima Linhares.

719
01:39:47,990 --> 01:39:49,924
I registered my kids.
