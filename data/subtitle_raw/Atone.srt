00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:26,520
<i>Oh, too heavy.</i>

3
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:50,076
<i>I need you.
No, no!</i>

4
00:01:29,454 --> 00:01:30,554
God bless you.

5
00:02:36,726 --> 00:02:38,193
Yeah!

6
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:55,409
The day won't go away, Mommy.

7
00:04:55,411 --> 00:04:58,378
Grandpa said you have
to be ready at 8.

8
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,680
Okay.

9
00:05:14,998 --> 00:05:17,468
Okay, I'm getting up.

10
00:05:19,536 --> 00:05:21,502
- Come on.
- Alright.

11
00:05:21,504 --> 00:05:24,906
We can't be late
and you can't be fat.

12
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,541
I'm not fat.

13
00:05:26,543 --> 00:05:27,678
Not yet.

14
00:05:28,713 --> 00:05:31,614
- I'll go get your clothes.
- Okay.

15
00:05:56,676 --> 00:05:58,477
I'm gonna make you lunch.

16
00:05:58,479 --> 00:05:59,578
<i>Done.</i>

17
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,678
<i>Homework done.</i>

18
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,450
Teeth, face, hair,
done.

19
00:06:04,385 --> 00:06:06,487
- Thanks.
- <i>You're welcome.</i>

20
00:06:43,627 --> 00:06:45,629
<i>What are you
doing with those thugs?</i>

21
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,741
<i>I know what tomorrow is.</i>

22
00:06:58,109 --> 00:07:00,510
It's been a tough year for you.

23
00:07:00,512 --> 00:07:03,813
<i>But at some point,
you have to stop this.</i>

24
00:07:09,122 --> 00:07:11,622
Tomorrow,
come to the church.

25
00:07:11,624 --> 00:07:14,459
I'm not going to that church.

26
00:07:14,461 --> 00:07:16,629
The bank called.

27
00:07:17,998 --> 00:07:19,931
<i>Your reference.</i>

28
00:07:19,933 --> 00:07:23,000
<i>Ninety days behind, Laura.</i>

29
00:07:23,002 --> 00:07:26,003
<i>You don't want to
lose this place, do you?</i>

30
00:07:26,005 --> 00:07:29,508
It's one of the few stable
things in Kate's life.

31
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,710
Kate is fine.

32
00:07:30,712 --> 00:07:31,977
<i>No, she's not.</i>

33
00:07:34,215 --> 00:07:36,418
<i>And you should see that.</i>

34
00:07:39,487 --> 00:07:40,855
Open the door.

35
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,508
<i>Papa!</i>

36
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:02,676
<i>Ah, there's my sweetheart!</i>

37
00:08:04,114 --> 00:08:06,218
Oh, gosh.

38
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:10,653
You look more and more
like your grandma did

39
00:08:10,655 --> 00:08:12,622
when she was your age.

40
00:08:12,624 --> 00:08:14,023
Beautiful!

41
00:08:14,025 --> 00:08:15,992
Are you still surprising
Mommy today?

42
00:08:15,994 --> 00:08:17,125
I am.

43
00:08:17,127 --> 00:08:19,195
You didn't spill the beans,
did you?

44
00:08:19,197 --> 00:08:22,633
Nope.
But it was so hard!

45
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:26,135
Good, you know how your
mom is about surprises.

46
00:08:26,137 --> 00:08:27,005
Morning.

47
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:35,783
Grumpy pants.

48
00:09:05,782 --> 00:09:07,949
Girl, this is really nice.

49
00:09:07,951 --> 00:09:09,349
It sure is.

50
00:09:09,351 --> 00:09:11,218
I can hardly wait till Sunday.

51
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,286
Wonder how many
people will show up.

52
00:09:12,288 --> 00:09:13,653
<i>Probably a lot.</i>

53
00:09:13,655 --> 00:09:16,022
<i>And you know, they're doing
such a good job with our...</i>

54
00:09:25,936 --> 00:09:27,138
Copy that.

55
00:10:08,783 --> 00:10:10,586
So, here you go.

56
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:12,718
You know the drill.

57
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,685
I want you to go straight home

58
00:10:13,687 --> 00:10:16,725
and don't open the door
until I get there.

59
00:10:18,227 --> 00:10:20,797
Hey, something wrong?

60
00:10:21,764 --> 00:10:24,031
Daddy died today
one year ago.

61
00:10:24,033 --> 00:10:25,201
Yeah.

62
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,035
I know.

63
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:31,107
<i>Okay.</i>

64
00:10:32,409 --> 00:10:35,375
Can I just come to the
new church with you today?

65
00:10:35,377 --> 00:10:36,878
- No.
- Please?

66
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,346
We talked about this,
remember?

67
00:10:38,348 --> 00:10:41,050
You can't miss any more
days of school.

68
00:10:45,022 --> 00:10:47,224
Hey, I got something for you.

69
00:11:01,105 --> 00:11:02,841
It's a bright color.

70
00:11:04,308 --> 00:11:06,277
And it's a bright day.

71
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:08,179
Alright, kiddo.

72
00:11:08,181 --> 00:11:10,884
Go ahead. Get to class
before the bell rings.

73
00:11:16,989 --> 00:11:18,659
I love you.

74
00:12:10,081 --> 00:12:11,883
<i>Ugh.</i>

75
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,121
There she is.
More beautiful than I remember.

76
00:12:19,123 --> 00:12:21,057
- Ah.
- Laura.

77
00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:23,092
Clarke.
You didn't tell her, did you?

78
00:12:23,094 --> 00:12:25,262
No, I didn't want to
spoil the surprise.

79
00:12:25,264 --> 00:12:27,364
Surprise? What surprise?

80
00:12:27,366 --> 00:12:29,166
Well, we won't keep you
waiting too long on it,

81
00:12:29,168 --> 00:12:31,067
but first,
I want you to meet Xander.

82
00:12:31,069 --> 00:12:33,804
Xander, Laura Bishop,
your new protégé.

83
00:12:33,806 --> 00:12:36,307
Former military,
former lawyer.

84
00:12:36,309 --> 00:12:38,375
Heck, she might've had
your job if she didn't quit.

85
00:12:38,377 --> 00:12:40,513
Shall we?

86
00:12:43,817 --> 00:12:46,818
I know. I'm fifteen
minutes behind schedule.

87
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,886
Well, they can't start
without you.

88
00:12:48,888 --> 00:12:50,488
Well, no, they can't.

89
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,123
Then you're on time.

90
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,593
Ha! That's what
I'm talking about.

91
00:12:53,595 --> 00:12:54,593
What would I do
without you, Xander?

92
00:12:54,595 --> 00:12:56,362
I don't know.
You wouldn't be able to handle

93
00:12:56,364 --> 00:12:57,296
all this without me.

94
00:12:57,298 --> 00:12:58,233
That is true.

95
00:12:59,466 --> 00:13:01,601
Do me a favor.
Will you prep her while I, uh,

96
00:13:01,603 --> 00:13:03,368
get up to this deacons
meeting with Clarke?

97
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:04,405
Yeah, sure.

98
00:13:05,841 --> 00:13:06,974
Yes, Reverend.

99
00:13:06,976 --> 00:13:07,878
That's better.

100
00:13:08,376 --> 00:13:09,844
Clarke, shall we?

101
00:13:09,846 --> 00:13:10,346
Sure.

102
00:13:11,213 --> 00:13:13,280
Do me a favor.
Will you run up ahead?

103
00:13:13,282 --> 00:13:15,315
I just gotta stop at
my office for a second.

104
00:13:15,317 --> 00:13:16,886
- Sure.
- Alright, thank you.

105
00:13:19,155 --> 00:13:20,621
<i>Started working on
security for the new building</i>

106
00:13:20,623 --> 00:13:21,558
<i>a month after you left.</i>

107
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:26,327
They hired me to replace you so
I guess I should say thank you.

108
00:13:26,329 --> 00:13:28,833
No. You don't have
to thank me.

109
00:13:30,234 --> 00:13:32,567
Cameras in all directions,
two-way.

110
00:13:32,569 --> 00:13:34,537
That glass is bulletproof.

111
00:13:34,539 --> 00:13:36,809
All doors have automatic locks.

112
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,512
You don't think it's
a bit much for a church?

113
00:13:45,184 --> 00:13:46,617
Memphis, Tennessee.

114
00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:48,551
Armed protestors
stormed a church.

115
00:13:48,553 --> 00:13:50,319
Virginia.
Two men were arrested

116
00:13:50,321 --> 00:13:52,421
for planning a mass attack
at their local church.

117
00:13:52,423 --> 00:13:54,093
South Carolina,
nine dead.

118
00:13:56,229 --> 00:13:57,565
Bottom line,

119
00:13:59,231 --> 00:14:00,900
it's all a bit much.

120
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:03,003
Till it isn't.

121
00:14:20,488 --> 00:14:21,990
There's more?

122
00:14:33,335 --> 00:14:35,305
It's a subbasement.
Level three.

123
00:14:36,638 --> 00:14:40,173
Sanctuary's the heart.
This is the brain.

124
00:14:40,175 --> 00:14:41,376
In the event of
a natural disaster,

125
00:14:41,378 --> 00:14:45,112
this floor alone could house
up to five thousand people.

126
00:14:45,114 --> 00:14:46,618
Like a modern day ark.

127
00:14:48,384 --> 00:14:51,021
State flags represent
the church's reach.

128
00:14:52,255 --> 00:14:54,690
I'd like to have that wall
filled in a year.

129
00:14:54,692 --> 00:14:57,627
Well, a lot has changed
in the last year.

130
00:14:57,629 --> 00:14:59,264
Mark's been working hard.

131
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,464
We all have.

132
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,082
Jenny, Tank.
Meet Laura Bishop,

133
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,485
our newest member,
Clarke's daughter.

134
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:21,720
Hi, I'm Jenny.

135
00:15:21,722 --> 00:15:23,087
<i>What happened to your face?</i>

136
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,023
Oh, Mike Tyson got lucky.

137
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:27,692
She's got a sense of humor.

138
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:30,295
<i>We're gonna get along
just fine. I'm Tank.</i>

139
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:31,065
Nice to meet you.

140
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,534
This is where you will
start your shift every day.

141
00:15:35,536 --> 00:15:39,005
You'll primarily have
exterior patrol.

142
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:41,274
Fridays are the slow days.

143
00:15:41,276 --> 00:15:42,575
Tank, do me a favor.

144
00:15:42,577 --> 00:15:45,245
Get her personnel info
on file, please.

145
00:15:45,247 --> 00:15:46,582
I'll be outside.

146
00:15:54,657 --> 00:15:56,690
I was just telling, uh,
Rusty here about

147
00:15:56,692 --> 00:15:58,392
how glad we are that
this thing's finally

148
00:15:58,394 --> 00:16:00,294
about ready to get opened
here, you know?

149
00:16:00,296 --> 00:16:01,628
<i>It's about time.</i>

150
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:04,431
Gentlemen, hope I didn't
keep you waiting too long.

151
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:06,368
Punctuality is a virtue.

152
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:08,170
- Reverend, very good to see you.
- Carl.

153
00:16:08,172 --> 00:16:09,571
What do you say?
What do you know?

154
00:16:09,573 --> 00:16:11,205
How you doin'?
Good.

155
00:16:11,207 --> 00:16:13,108
Better be seen than viewed,
young man.

156
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,609
<i>How you doin', Rusty?</i>

157
00:16:14,611 --> 00:16:18,114
You old silver grey fox you.

158
00:16:18,116 --> 00:16:19,282
Oh, I'm excited.

159
00:16:19,284 --> 00:16:22,085
<i>Can you believe that
it's only three days out</i>

160
00:16:22,087 --> 00:16:24,156
till we open our new chapter?

161
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,222
Let's get you back
top side.

162
00:16:26,224 --> 00:16:28,526
The deacons wanted
to have a word with you.

163
00:16:32,264 --> 00:16:33,631
Last thing.

164
00:16:33,633 --> 00:16:34,533
Room 139.

165
00:16:36,134 --> 00:16:38,369
This is where we house
the emergency exit.

166
00:16:38,371 --> 00:16:41,309
It's the only way out from this
floor if the elevators go down.

167
00:16:42,842 --> 00:16:45,309
This says, uh, "janitor".

168
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,710
Yep, hidden in plain sight.

169
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,118
Pray you never have to see it.

170
00:16:56,457 --> 00:16:57,456
Things have
come together nicely.

171
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:58,624
Thank you.

172
00:16:58,626 --> 00:17:01,828
<i>I still do not
believe this move is...</i>

173
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:02,698
necessary.

174
00:17:03,664 --> 00:17:05,566
<i>But, as you all know,</i>

175
00:17:05,568 --> 00:17:06,834
I got outvoted.

176
00:17:06,836 --> 00:17:09,303
Well, Rusty,
you're always slow to change.

177
00:17:09,305 --> 00:17:10,871
People have lost faith.

178
00:17:10,873 --> 00:17:12,739
<i>This building screams faith.</i>

179
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:15,275
- Amen.
- Something to aspire to.

180
00:17:15,277 --> 00:17:16,643
Speaking of lost faith,

181
00:17:16,645 --> 00:17:18,480
guess who's back today?

182
00:17:27,223 --> 00:17:31,359
Hey, why are those guys
in military formation?

183
00:17:31,361 --> 00:17:33,297
Xander's training for
opening day.

184
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:36,201
Hmm.

185
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,110
<i>Laura, please take a seat.</i>

186
00:17:46,712 --> 00:17:48,481
Laura, these are new.

187
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,183
<i>Small reference.</i>

188
00:17:52,317 --> 00:17:54,417
- <i>You should take it.</i>
- Hmm.

189
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:56,186
<i>Laura I know you
don't like surprises,</i>

190
00:17:56,188 --> 00:17:59,389
so I'll just not keep you
waiting any longer.

191
00:17:59,391 --> 00:18:01,224
<i>I also know you haven't
been around the church much</i>

192
00:18:01,226 --> 00:18:02,894
<i>since you lost David.</i>

193
00:18:02,896 --> 00:18:04,494
<i>That is,</i>

194
00:18:04,496 --> 00:18:06,366
since David passed away.

195
00:18:07,634 --> 00:18:10,468
<i>And we all know how much
David loved the kids</i>

196
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,803
<i>and dedicated to
the kids of the church.</i>

197
00:18:12,805 --> 00:18:14,842
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>
- So we decided...

198
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:17,877
to honor David

199
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:20,813
and dedicate the new wing

200
00:18:20,815 --> 00:18:22,482
to him.

201
00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:29,390
From this day forward,

202
00:18:29,392 --> 00:18:33,360
it'll be known as the
David A. Bishop Youth Wing.

203
00:18:40,803 --> 00:18:41,906
That's um...

204
00:18:42,838 --> 00:18:44,774
That's really kind of you all.

205
00:18:55,653 --> 00:18:57,489
Would you excuse me
for one minute?

206
00:19:07,532 --> 00:19:08,300
<i>It's okay.</i>

207
00:19:09,268 --> 00:19:12,001
She just needs time to process.

208
00:19:12,003 --> 00:19:14,003
Well, we can, uh,

209
00:19:14,005 --> 00:19:18,475
<i>proceed with our business and
return to this matter later.</i>

210
00:19:18,477 --> 00:19:19,679
That's a good idea, Carl.

211
00:19:20,647 --> 00:19:22,981
<i>If we could all open our books</i>

212
00:19:22,983 --> 00:19:24,848
and turn to page one.

213
00:20:17,909 --> 00:20:19,007
<i>Yoo-hoo.</i>

214
00:20:29,788 --> 00:20:31,523
Silver, Orange,
third floor.

215
00:20:32,724 --> 00:20:34,026
Yellow, Green,
second floor.

216
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,863
<i>Blue, Red,
secure the conference room.</i>

217
00:21:24,614 --> 00:21:25,879
<i>Cell phones
won't work with this</i>

218
00:21:25,881 --> 00:21:28,148
<i>high-tech security
running through the ceilings.</i>

219
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:30,586
<i>And because it's not due
to open for another 48 hours,</i>

220
00:21:30,588 --> 00:21:33,658
<i>any chance of help from
the outside is virtually zero.</i>

221
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:43,766
<i>All floors locked down.
Cell signals are jammed.</i>

222
00:21:43,768 --> 00:21:45,570
<i>Whenever you're ready.</i>

223
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,806
Let there be night.

224
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,773
<i>Between 2014</i>

225
00:21:50,775 --> 00:21:53,444
and 2016
from our collection...

226
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:54,678
<i>Oh, great.</i>

227
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,580
<i>Reverend, what's
going on with your lights?</i>

228
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:59,049
<i>I paid the
over-expensive light.</i>

229
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,551
<i>What's going on?</i>

230
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:02,786
One of the grunts
probably tripped a line.

231
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:05,556
Security system's
still in tact, though.

232
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:06,493
<i>It's on a different circuit.</i>

233
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:11,595
Control, this is Alpha.
Trip back ups, please.

234
00:22:11,597 --> 00:22:13,497
<i>I need all doors unlocked.</i>

235
00:22:17,838 --> 00:22:19,807
Mark, get down.

236
00:22:20,842 --> 00:22:22,911
<i>Sarah!</i>

237
00:22:24,144 --> 00:22:25,977
- <i>Are you okay?</i>
- <i>Stay there.</i>

238
00:22:25,979 --> 00:22:27,913
<i>Baby.
Go on, do something!</i>

239
00:22:27,915 --> 00:22:29,783
Baby, are you okay?

240
00:22:29,785 --> 00:22:31,919
Shaw, what is going on here?

241
00:22:31,921 --> 00:22:34,121
- <i>Baby.</i>
- <i>Guys,</i>

242
00:22:34,123 --> 00:22:35,721
<i>I need you in that corner.</i>

243
00:22:35,723 --> 00:22:37,493
Quickly, please, quickly.

244
00:22:41,897 --> 00:22:45,001
Xander, are we alright?

245
00:22:58,915 --> 00:23:00,050
Open the door.

246
00:23:01,184 --> 00:23:02,651
I don't know
what's going on here,

247
00:23:02,653 --> 00:23:04,122
but I'll let the police
deal with it.

248
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,588
Were those gunshots?

249
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:38,956
No. I know gunshots.

250
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:41,596
<i>Those most definitely
were not gunshots.</i>

251
00:23:49,271 --> 00:23:50,970
Where are you going?

252
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:52,608
This woman still got in here.

253
00:23:53,976 --> 00:23:55,743
You swept the whole place?

254
00:23:55,745 --> 00:23:57,110
Yeah, but she got past me.

255
00:23:57,112 --> 00:24:00,714
You better find her
before Black finds out.

256
00:24:00,716 --> 00:24:03,650
Come on, man, I got this.
Just check.

257
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:08,692
Kate.

258
00:24:12,028 --> 00:24:13,163
Kate.

259
00:24:17,568 --> 00:24:18,103
Kate.

260
00:24:22,073 --> 00:24:23,242
Kate.

261
00:24:33,117 --> 00:24:34,351
I hope this doesn't
have anything to do

262
00:24:34,353 --> 00:24:36,022
with our new hire.

263
00:24:37,122 --> 00:24:38,055
Xander,

264
00:24:38,057 --> 00:24:41,225
I've always questioned
your intelligence.

265
00:24:41,227 --> 00:24:43,627
Thank you for
providing the answer.

266
00:24:43,629 --> 00:24:46,163
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Gentlemen, take it easy.

267
00:24:46,165 --> 00:24:49,200
Xander, do not
jump to conclusions.

268
00:24:49,202 --> 00:24:50,268
I can vouch for Laura.

269
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:53,905
Clarke, we cannot afford
to turn on each other now.

270
00:24:53,907 --> 00:24:56,240
Just relax, please.

271
00:24:56,242 --> 00:24:59,310
Now, we have a system,
a protocol,

272
00:24:59,312 --> 00:25:03,015
and it is gonna be infallible,
right, Xander?

273
00:25:03,017 --> 00:25:04,854
It's the best money can buy.

274
00:25:08,189 --> 00:25:09,822
<i>Control, come in.</i>

275
00:25:09,824 --> 00:25:11,660
<i>Control, where are you?</i>

276
00:25:12,627 --> 00:25:14,193
Gentlemen.

277
00:25:14,195 --> 00:25:16,998
<i>I know your minds are
flooded with questions.</i>

278
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,367
Questions that,
with patience, will subside,

279
00:25:19,369 --> 00:25:21,402
as I do not relish
in indecisiveness.

280
00:25:21,404 --> 00:25:23,803
<i>I don't know who
you are or what you want.</i>

281
00:25:23,805 --> 00:25:26,072
I'm Xander Worth.
I'm head of security.

282
00:25:26,074 --> 00:25:28,877
I know who you are, Mr. Worth,
and I know who you are not,

283
00:25:28,879 --> 00:25:30,177
<i>so spare me the macho rhetoric</i>

284
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:32,214
<i>and understand
you are not in control</i>

285
00:25:32,216 --> 00:25:33,181
of anything.

286
00:25:33,183 --> 00:25:33,918
Sir.

287
00:25:34,885 --> 00:25:37,319
<i>My name is
Reverend Mark Shaw.</i>

288
00:25:37,321 --> 00:25:39,287
I'm the head of this church.

289
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:41,657
<i>Now, y-you seem like
a reasonable man.</i>

290
00:25:41,659 --> 00:25:43,292
<i>Whatever it is you want,
just let me know,</i>

291
00:25:43,294 --> 00:25:45,028
and you and I can
work this out.

292
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:47,897
And you, Reverend,
my favorite reverend,

293
00:25:47,899 --> 00:25:50,332
from the impoverished streets
of Memphis, Tennessee

294
00:25:50,334 --> 00:25:54,204
to the powerful pulpit
of Bethel Community Church.

295
00:25:54,206 --> 00:25:56,939
Listen, genius.
Reciting facts you can find

296
00:25:56,941 --> 00:25:58,876
on any online bio about this man

297
00:25:58,878 --> 00:26:01,712
doesn't exactly infuse us
with a sense of

298
00:26:01,714 --> 00:26:04,783
shock and awe that
I'm sure you were going for.

299
00:26:12,425 --> 00:26:15,025
<i>How's that for shock and awe?</i>

300
00:26:18,932 --> 00:26:20,932
Now that your mouths are closed
and your eyes are open,

301
00:26:20,934 --> 00:26:22,133
<i>we'll make this simple.</i>

302
00:26:22,135 --> 00:26:23,436
Sir, what is it that you want?

303
00:26:23,438 --> 00:26:28,407
Harming us will achieve nothing
but more hurt, more bloodshed.

304
00:26:28,409 --> 00:26:32,179
I'd like to come up with a
reasonable resolution with you.

305
00:26:32,181 --> 00:26:35,382
<i>One that we can all live with.</i>

306
00:26:38,052 --> 00:26:40,086
Reverend,
always with the silver...

307
00:26:40,088 --> 00:26:42,757
should I say, golden...
tongue.

308
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:45,793
Ah, I believe that relationships
require a give and take

309
00:26:45,795 --> 00:26:47,828
as well as trust
to be fruitful.

310
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,497
So given the abrupt
beginning to our relationship,

311
00:26:49,499 --> 00:26:52,033
let me start first by
offering some goodwill.

312
00:26:52,035 --> 00:26:53,004
How kind.

313
00:26:54,204 --> 00:26:56,003
I will allow
one person to leave.

314
00:26:56,005 --> 00:26:57,772
<i>They will be allowed to
wait in the delivery area</i>

315
00:26:57,774 --> 00:27:00,108
until our purpose here
is complete.

316
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:03,746
When we leave,
they'll be allowed to leave.

317
00:27:03,748 --> 00:27:06,182
How do we know you
won't kill 'em once he's out?

318
00:27:06,184 --> 00:27:08,350
If you cooperate and
simply follow my rules,

319
00:27:08,352 --> 00:27:11,154
everyone will make it
outta here alive and well.

320
00:27:11,156 --> 00:27:11,889
If not,

321
00:27:13,058 --> 00:27:15,261
<i>well, you made that decision.</i>

322
00:27:16,194 --> 00:27:17,397
<i>Please confirm.</i>

323
00:27:18,196 --> 00:27:19,866
<i>You have one minute.</i>

324
00:27:22,167 --> 00:27:25,138
And oh, one person.

325
00:27:26,505 --> 00:27:27,873
Any more than that,

326
00:27:28,976 --> 00:27:31,111
and you will have
revoked my goodwill.

327
00:27:33,147 --> 00:27:35,946
<i>Oh, baby,
it's okay, it's okay.</i>

328
00:27:35,948 --> 00:27:37,515
<i>W-We're gonna get
you out of here.</i>

329
00:27:37,517 --> 00:27:39,352
<i>I promise,
we'll get you out of here.</i>

330
00:27:41,523 --> 00:27:42,791
Shaw,

331
00:27:43,557 --> 00:27:46,859
She leaves.
She goes.

332
00:27:46,861 --> 00:27:48,794
Yes, Carl,
that's a good idea.

333
00:27:48,796 --> 00:27:50,463
<i>Women and children
always go first.</i>

334
00:27:50,465 --> 00:27:52,533
There's no kids here.

335
00:27:52,535 --> 00:27:53,966
<i>Sh-she goes.</i>

336
00:27:53,968 --> 00:27:55,936
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- No, baby.

337
00:27:55,938 --> 00:27:58,138
<i>I'm gonna follow her out.</i>

338
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,406
I'll duck behind her,

339
00:27:59,408 --> 00:28:01,307
by the time they see me,
I'll be all over 'em.

340
00:28:01,309 --> 00:28:02,575
<i>They're not gonna shoot her.</i>

341
00:28:02,577 --> 00:28:04,311
How do you know
they won't shoot her?

342
00:28:04,313 --> 00:28:06,346
And how do you know
how many are out there?

343
00:28:06,348 --> 00:28:08,149
<i>Easy, Clarke.</i>

344
00:28:08,151 --> 00:28:09,820
You said you heard a gun.

345
00:28:10,854 --> 00:28:12,320
There's two of them
down there.

346
00:28:12,322 --> 00:28:13,420
How many did you see?

347
00:28:13,422 --> 00:28:14,157
O-one.

348
00:28:15,357 --> 00:28:18,193
There might've been two,
but I only saw one.

349
00:28:18,195 --> 00:28:19,330
Right, she saw one.

350
00:28:21,065 --> 00:28:23,364
I don't think it's a good idea.

351
00:28:23,366 --> 00:28:24,600
It's not smart.

352
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:27,239
What Clarke?
Your daughter's gonna save us?

353
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,376
I have a plan.
I'll handle it.

354
00:28:32,845 --> 00:28:34,780
Why don't one of us go?

355
00:28:35,614 --> 00:28:38,217
<i>Just in case it
might be a ruse.</i>

356
00:28:56,904 --> 00:28:59,337
- <i>You ready?</i>
- Be careful.

357
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:01,573
Come on,
let's get her out of here.

358
00:29:01,575 --> 00:29:02,410
Come on.

359
00:29:03,144 --> 00:29:04,444
<i>Are you sure?</i>

360
00:29:04,446 --> 00:29:06,311
I'm the head of security
for a reason.

361
00:29:07,415 --> 00:29:09,281
<i>It's gonna be alright.</i>

362
00:29:09,283 --> 00:29:12,251
Come on, it's gonna be okay.
Just keep your faith.

363
00:29:40,485 --> 00:29:41,219
Oh!

364
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:50,959
W-What happened, Xander?

365
00:30:27,268 --> 00:30:28,337
Kate.

366
00:30:39,146 --> 00:30:40,250
Kate.

367
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:45,088
Kate.

368
00:30:48,724 --> 00:30:50,059
Kate.

369
00:31:15,719 --> 00:31:17,556
Can I just come to the new
church with you today?

370
00:31:45,318 --> 00:31:46,752
Hold it.

371
00:31:48,389 --> 00:31:49,623
We're going downstairs.

372
00:31:52,393 --> 00:31:55,131
You let me find my little girl,

373
00:31:58,566 --> 00:32:00,002
I'll let you live.

374
00:32:20,191 --> 00:32:21,222
<i>Where's Sarah?</i>

375
00:32:21,224 --> 00:32:23,528
No, no, no, no!

376
00:32:27,631 --> 00:32:29,265
Calm down, old man.

377
00:32:29,267 --> 00:32:32,268
Alright, Xander,
get off of him. Relax.

378
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,435
Relax, old fella.

379
00:32:33,437 --> 00:32:36,538
Rules.
Follow rules, Mr. Worth.

380
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,141
<i>Are you one of those
"Do as I say,</i>

381
00:32:38,143 --> 00:32:40,078
<i>not as I do"
type of fellas?</i>

382
00:32:42,115 --> 00:32:43,847
You didn't have to kill her.

383
00:32:43,849 --> 00:32:45,415
You didn't have to
break my rule.

384
00:32:45,417 --> 00:32:46,819
She didn't.

385
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,789
He did.

386
00:32:50,889 --> 00:32:52,723
I find the consequences
of one's sins is

387
00:32:52,725 --> 00:32:54,326
rarely borne by that person.

388
00:32:54,328 --> 00:32:56,560
It's really borne by
the people around them.

389
00:32:56,562 --> 00:32:58,497
And Mr. Worth's
sins of deception

390
00:32:58,499 --> 00:33:00,635
was felt by that poor woman.

391
00:33:02,836 --> 00:33:04,637
Well, since that was
an utter failure,

392
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:06,371
let's proceed to do
what we must do

393
00:33:06,373 --> 00:33:08,209
<i>to leave here alive, hmm?</i>

394
00:33:09,811 --> 00:33:13,479
There's a laptop there,
under the table.

395
00:33:13,481 --> 00:33:14,679
<i>Please open it.</i>

396
00:33:14,681 --> 00:33:16,084
<i>Not you.</i>

397
00:33:16,718 --> 00:33:17,620
You.

398
00:33:19,655 --> 00:33:20,657
Me?

399
00:33:21,623 --> 00:33:23,256
<i>You are the treasurer and CFO</i>

400
00:33:23,258 --> 00:33:24,291
<i>and have access
to all the accounts.</i>

401
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:25,659
<i>So you will transfer
all the funds</i>

402
00:33:25,661 --> 00:33:28,865
<i>to the bank account that is
open on the terminal page.</i>

403
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:42,844
Wait... wait a minute.
He doesn't know how to do that!

404
00:33:42,846 --> 00:33:45,180
Yes, he does.

405
00:33:45,182 --> 00:33:48,417
<i>The bank account reads what,
gentlemen?</i>

406
00:33:51,956 --> 00:33:54,323
Ten million,
four hundred thousand.

407
00:33:54,325 --> 00:33:55,324
And in the pastor's fund?

408
00:33:55,326 --> 00:33:58,327
Please tell me there is
no pastor's account.

409
00:34:02,668 --> 00:34:04,271
We set up an account.

410
00:34:04,971 --> 00:34:06,871
A pastor's account,

411
00:34:06,873 --> 00:34:09,273
that would not technically be

412
00:34:09,275 --> 00:34:12,378
income to the Reverend
nor the Church.

413
00:34:13,913 --> 00:34:16,582
And the Reverend
spends from that account.

414
00:34:16,584 --> 00:34:17,652
<i>How much?</i>

415
00:34:18,986 --> 00:34:20,587
4.1 million.

416
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:25,225
<i>Perfect.</i>

417
00:34:26,327 --> 00:34:29,598
<i>Now, please execute
this transaction.</i>

418
00:34:31,632 --> 00:34:33,335
No!

419
00:34:34,369 --> 00:34:37,206
No! No!

420
00:34:38,373 --> 00:34:40,209
We can't give him the money.

421
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:41,941
Don't you understand?

422
00:34:41,943 --> 00:34:42,810
Reverend,
are you speaking out of

423
00:34:42,812 --> 00:34:43,843
concern for the
lives of your sheep

424
00:34:43,845 --> 00:34:46,647
or the loss of your luxury
home, car, boat, and

425
00:34:46,649 --> 00:34:49,283
- <i>apartments for your mistresses?</i>
- You shut your mouth!

426
00:34:49,285 --> 00:34:52,356
Do you hear me?
Shut your mouth!

427
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:56,023
You son of a gun.

428
00:34:56,025 --> 00:34:58,326
This isn't some mafia family,

429
00:34:58,328 --> 00:35:00,262
this is a church!

430
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,933
<i>You have a board.</i>

431
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,672
And you two sicken me.

432
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:12,508
I thought your toys were
paid for by your books.

433
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,776
Books?

434
00:35:14,778 --> 00:35:17,413
Has anyone checked
his book sales?

435
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:19,919
And I thought you were
the real thing.

436
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:26,857
<i>Simply enter the two account
numbers in the first field.</i>

437
00:35:26,859 --> 00:35:29,963
<i>Enter pound total into
the second and press enter.</i>

438
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:37,302
Give him what he wants.

439
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:38,403
<i>Confirming the funds.</i>

440
00:35:38,405 --> 00:35:40,071
<i>We need that money.</i>

441
00:35:40,073 --> 00:35:40,674
<i>Done.</i>

442
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,911
- It's there?
- It's there.

443
00:37:11,172 --> 00:37:12,737
Your turn.

444
00:37:43,673 --> 00:37:45,941
Guess those weren't
gunshots either.

445
00:37:48,778 --> 00:37:50,912
Lets get our boys and bail.

446
00:37:50,914 --> 00:37:52,080
Not yet.

447
00:37:52,082 --> 00:37:53,651
<i>Hello?</i>

448
00:37:55,854 --> 00:37:57,053
<i>Kind greetings.</i>

449
00:37:57,055 --> 00:38:00,056
<i>Who do I have the
pleasure of speaking with?</i>

450
00:38:00,058 --> 00:38:01,524
A witness.

451
00:38:01,526 --> 00:38:03,927
Someone who wants to go
along with her business.

452
00:38:03,929 --> 00:38:05,762
<i>But first, I need something.</i>

453
00:38:05,764 --> 00:38:08,566
Well, that presents us
with a problem.

454
00:38:08,568 --> 00:38:09,934
A couple of my friends
seem to be missing.

455
00:38:09,936 --> 00:38:11,004
Have you happened to see them?

456
00:38:12,972 --> 00:38:15,008
Well, if I have?

457
00:38:16,176 --> 00:38:17,875
<i>Then they should
return to me unharmed,</i>

458
00:38:17,877 --> 00:38:20,011
<i>and we can
consider your request.</i>

459
00:38:21,714 --> 00:38:22,983
And if I haven't?

460
00:38:24,718 --> 00:38:26,484
Then they should
return to me unharmed,

461
00:38:26,486 --> 00:38:28,022
and we will
consider your request.

462
00:38:29,556 --> 00:38:31,257
And if I don't?

463
00:38:31,259 --> 00:38:32,828
<i>Then you don't.</i>

464
00:38:34,027 --> 00:38:36,762
I guess we're at an impasse.

465
00:38:36,764 --> 00:38:38,563
Since our paths are
bound to cross,

466
00:38:38,565 --> 00:38:39,867
can I have the
pleasure of knowing

467
00:38:39,869 --> 00:38:42,002
who it is I'm speaking with?

468
00:38:42,004 --> 00:38:45,004
And give away the
element of surprise?

469
00:38:45,006 --> 00:38:46,508
<i>I hate surprises.</i>

470
00:38:47,709 --> 00:38:49,912
That sounds like we have
something in common.

471
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:51,646
<i>Okay.</i>

472
00:38:52,648 --> 00:38:54,150
<i>I will see you soon.</i>

473
00:38:55,252 --> 00:38:57,121
Not before I see you.

474
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:04,626
Find her.

475
00:39:04,628 --> 00:39:08,196
- Bro, she's not worth it...
- Find her.

476
00:39:16,975 --> 00:39:18,243
Attention, team.

477
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:23,078
There seems to be a
loose end we need to clip.

478
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,182
Find her.

479
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:25,884
Kill her.

480
00:39:26,317 --> 00:39:27,652
<i>Black out.</i>

481
00:39:48,741 --> 00:39:50,812
Who are you?

482
00:39:51,913 --> 00:39:54,280
Shannon. HR.

483
00:39:54,282 --> 00:39:55,981
I heard the shots so I hid.

484
00:39:55,983 --> 00:39:57,316
<i>Where's Cindy?</i>

485
00:39:57,318 --> 00:39:59,288
Y-you mean Sarah?

486
00:40:00,355 --> 00:40:02,021
They took her.

487
00:40:02,023 --> 00:40:03,590
You let 'em?

488
00:40:03,592 --> 00:40:04,959
<i>I don't...</i>

489
00:40:04,961 --> 00:40:06,663
I'm not good with guns.

490
00:40:08,897 --> 00:40:10,863
You never told me your name.

491
00:40:10,865 --> 00:40:12,299
Bishop.

492
00:40:12,301 --> 00:40:13,734
<i>Laura Bishop.</i>

493
00:40:13,736 --> 00:40:15,806
<i>Clarke's kid?</i>

494
00:40:18,275 --> 00:40:20,043
<i>What a welcome back, huh?</i>

495
00:40:21,244 --> 00:40:22,947
I don't remember you.

496
00:40:26,183 --> 00:40:28,950
Laura Bishop.

497
00:40:28,952 --> 00:40:29,687
Wow!

498
00:40:30,821 --> 00:40:33,222
So, I guess it's true
what they said?

499
00:40:33,224 --> 00:40:35,223
Former secret
operations soldier,

500
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:36,758
<i>or something,</i>

501
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,993
<i>settled down to be a mom.</i>

502
00:40:37,995 --> 00:40:40,764
You know, I wanted to hear...
Oh, God.

503
00:40:40,766 --> 00:40:42,936
The little girl.
Where is she?

504
00:40:45,404 --> 00:40:46,402
Where is she?

505
00:40:46,404 --> 00:40:49,239
- The little girl.
- I-I don't...

506
00:40:49,241 --> 00:40:50,340
Are you with them?

507
00:40:50,342 --> 00:40:51,876
<i>No! No.</i>

508
00:40:51,878 --> 00:40:52,709
I don't believe you.

509
00:40:52,711 --> 00:40:56,347
Look at them.
And now, look at me.

510
00:40:56,349 --> 00:40:59,417
<i>I saw dudes with guns,
so I hid in the supply closet.</i>

511
00:40:59,419 --> 00:41:01,051
<i>Why'd you come out?</i>

512
00:41:01,053 --> 00:41:01,956
I'm...

513
00:41:03,757 --> 00:41:05,125
I'm afraid of the dark.

514
00:41:11,297 --> 00:41:13,431
We are gonna get
out of here, right?

515
00:41:13,433 --> 00:41:15,000
I am.

516
00:41:15,002 --> 00:41:16,202
<i>You...</i>

517
00:41:16,204 --> 00:41:18,207
You can find your own way.

518
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:22,143
No, we am.

519
00:41:26,081 --> 00:41:27,651
I don't have time for this.

520
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:32,055
Do not follow me.

521
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:01,420
<i>Alright, lads.</i>

522
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:04,454
Eyes on third floor.

523
00:42:04,456 --> 00:42:06,289
Third room on the left.

524
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:07,326
Check it out.

525
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:09,295
That didn't take long.

526
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:12,699
Time for phase three.

527
00:44:17,467 --> 00:44:19,069
Phase three?

528
00:44:20,036 --> 00:44:21,272
There's only two phases.

529
00:44:22,339 --> 00:44:24,639
<i>No, there's always
been three.</i>

530
00:44:24,641 --> 00:44:27,110
But I couldn't share
until I secured the first two.

531
00:44:35,553 --> 00:44:37,088
I said let's go.

532
00:44:38,521 --> 00:44:40,223
I'm sorry, brother.

533
00:44:40,225 --> 00:44:40,960
You hypocrite.

534
00:44:42,293 --> 00:44:45,996
You wouldn't have helped
me if I told you the truth.

535
00:44:45,998 --> 00:44:46,899
You're a liar.

536
00:44:48,165 --> 00:44:51,501
You think I'm gonna go
to jail because of you?

537
00:44:51,503 --> 00:44:52,572
Huh?

538
00:44:56,376 --> 00:44:59,977
Well, believe me, I'll blow
your brains out right now.

539
00:44:59,979 --> 00:45:01,281
Put the gun down, friend.

540
00:45:02,981 --> 00:45:07,051
You've been a strong soldier
since our days over in Baghdad,

541
00:45:07,053 --> 00:45:10,257
but for the greater good
requires a greater sacrifice.

542
00:45:11,658 --> 00:45:13,627
Or, kill me.

543
00:45:14,995 --> 00:45:16,432
Because I'm not leaving.

544
00:45:27,709 --> 00:45:30,412
Your wife will have
enough to be okay.

545
00:45:32,681 --> 00:45:34,317
Brothers in arms.

546
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:38,421
I need you to help me
finish this, man.

547
00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:42,926
- Ooh-rah!
- Ooh-rah!

548
00:45:56,307 --> 00:45:58,239
<i>It's like...</i>

549
00:45:58,241 --> 00:46:00,743
<i>people with guns,
and like...</i>

550
00:46:00,745 --> 00:46:02,114
I'm like...

551
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,416
I'm really scared.

552
00:46:05,317 --> 00:46:07,217
I'm gonna go up there,

553
00:46:07,219 --> 00:46:09,422
and I'm gonna keep
looking for my daughter.

554
00:46:11,322 --> 00:46:13,389
No, no, no, no, no.
I have to come with you.

555
00:46:13,391 --> 00:46:15,493
- No, Shannon, you can't.
- No, I have to come with you.

556
00:46:15,495 --> 00:46:18,428
No, no, Shannon.
You can't go with me. No.

557
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:20,397
But-but, we're friends.

558
00:46:20,399 --> 00:46:23,070
<i>No, we're not friends.
We are not friends.</i>

559
00:46:26,338 --> 00:46:27,574
Alright.

560
00:46:28,641 --> 00:46:30,608
I'm going this way.

561
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:32,413
Take care of yourself,
okay?

562
00:46:34,181 --> 00:46:36,415
Are you cranky 'cause
the David thing?

563
00:46:36,417 --> 00:46:37,750
'Cause they're naming
a wing after David?

564
00:46:37,752 --> 00:46:38,684
- You don't know anything
- <i>Wait.</i>

565
00:46:38,686 --> 00:46:40,419
- about my husband.
- <i>Please don't.</i>

566
00:46:40,421 --> 00:46:41,553
Don't even bring his name up.

567
00:46:41,555 --> 00:46:43,555
I'm-I'm sorry.
I-I didn't...

568
00:46:43,557 --> 00:46:44,591
I didn't mean to upset you.

569
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:46,995
I just was trying to
figure out what was wrong.

570
00:46:49,731 --> 00:46:50,796
D-did you wanna talk about it?

571
00:46:50,798 --> 00:46:51,799
No, I don't wanna
talk about it.

572
00:46:51,801 --> 00:46:53,034
It seems like you might
wanna talk about it

573
00:46:53,036 --> 00:46:56,369
because I remember one time
when I was like, really little...

574
00:46:56,371 --> 00:46:58,239
He died on this day
a year ago.

575
00:46:58,241 --> 00:46:59,607
<i>My daughter's trapped
in this building.</i>

576
00:46:59,609 --> 00:47:01,308
<i>There's a bunch of
gunmen going around.</i>

577
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:04,146
My dad thinks I'm crazy.

578
00:47:04,148 --> 00:47:06,718
And I'm being shot at, and...

579
00:47:08,786 --> 00:47:10,521
Shannon, I'm tired.

580
00:47:11,255 --> 00:47:13,257
I'm really tired.

581
00:47:16,227 --> 00:47:17,196
Yeah.

582
00:47:22,567 --> 00:47:24,570
- I gotta go.
- Wait.

583
00:47:30,275 --> 00:47:31,742
<i>You're like
a real-life soldier,</i>

584
00:47:31,744 --> 00:47:34,577
like a "take a cyanide pill
when you're in trouble" kind.

585
00:47:34,579 --> 00:47:35,514
Shannon.

586
00:47:36,615 --> 00:47:37,780
Did they call you 007?

587
00:47:37,782 --> 00:47:40,451
- Shannon!
- Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

588
00:47:40,453 --> 00:47:41,654
Where are we going?

589
00:47:45,624 --> 00:47:46,593
<i>Kate!</i>

590
00:47:48,361 --> 00:47:49,330
Kate!

591
00:47:53,467 --> 00:47:54,365
Kate!

592
00:47:59,107 --> 00:48:00,041
Kate.

593
00:48:04,613 --> 00:48:06,745
Maybe, uh...

594
00:48:06,747 --> 00:48:08,316
she's not here?

595
00:48:16,458 --> 00:48:17,326
Mommy!

596
00:48:22,632 --> 00:48:23,634
<i>Mommy!</i>

597
00:48:24,601 --> 00:48:26,233
Cupcake.

598
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:31,209
I was so worried about you.

599
00:48:33,144 --> 00:48:35,546
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

600
00:48:38,414 --> 00:48:40,482
Why weren't you in school today?

601
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:43,652
Papa told me about
Daddy's surprise,

602
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:46,389
and I wanted to be
here with you.

603
00:48:54,267 --> 00:48:55,602
Come here.

604
00:48:58,838 --> 00:49:01,108
A little too tight, Mommy.

605
00:49:01,807 --> 00:49:03,811
Oh, sorry.

606
00:49:06,879 --> 00:49:09,480
<i>Alright, so,</i>

607
00:49:09,482 --> 00:49:11,183
we're gonna
get out of here, okay?

608
00:49:11,185 --> 00:49:12,183
- Okay.
- Ready?

609
00:49:12,185 --> 00:49:13,353
- Mm-hmm.
- Let's go.

610
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:20,592
- We can't leave Xander and Shaw.
- Papa?

611
00:49:20,594 --> 00:49:22,394
Maybe you didn't notice
the gun-totin' bad guys?

612
00:49:22,396 --> 00:49:23,496
<i>I did.</i>

613
00:49:23,498 --> 00:49:25,831
Well, we'll get the police
and let them handle it.

614
00:49:25,833 --> 00:49:27,567
What if it's too late?

615
00:49:27,569 --> 00:49:28,902
It's not.

616
00:49:28,904 --> 00:49:31,404
Your grandpa is strong
and he can handle himself.

617
00:49:31,406 --> 00:49:32,441
Come on.

618
00:49:35,444 --> 00:49:37,611
He's gonna be fine.

619
00:49:37,613 --> 00:49:39,614
Police are gonna be here
before you know it.

620
00:49:39,616 --> 00:49:40,847
Come on.

621
00:49:40,849 --> 00:49:42,516
- Laura.
- Look!

622
00:49:42,518 --> 00:49:45,822
We're leaving and you can do
whatever you wanna do.

623
00:49:55,832 --> 00:49:57,299
I gotta get out of here.

624
00:49:57,301 --> 00:49:58,299
Where are you going?

625
00:49:58,301 --> 00:50:00,838
If I don't make it,
she stays with her uncle.

626
00:50:04,842 --> 00:50:05,645
Go!

627
00:50:06,844 --> 00:50:07,946
No, Mom, no!

628
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,547
- Mom! Mom!
- Go, we gotta go!

629
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:11,551
We gotta go, come on.

630
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:14,487
Go!

631
00:50:17,423 --> 00:50:18,225
Take her!

632
00:50:59,935 --> 00:51:01,435
Psst.

633
00:51:18,756 --> 00:51:20,792
<i>You know what
really bothers me?</i>

634
00:51:25,096 --> 00:51:27,967
I told Sarah that
I'd be the first to go.

635
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:36,873
You have all we got.

636
00:51:36,875 --> 00:51:38,742
Why not just let us go?

637
00:51:38,744 --> 00:51:41,546
<i>Oh, there's plenty left.</i>

638
00:51:41,548 --> 00:51:43,613
<i>I have all you have...
do you mean money?</i>

639
00:51:54,962 --> 00:51:57,496
Ooh.

640
00:51:57,498 --> 00:51:59,867
Oh.

641
00:52:01,936 --> 00:52:03,702
Oh, sorry, Rev.
Please forgive me.

642
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:07,006
My manners have escaped me,
but it is laughable

643
00:52:07,008 --> 00:52:08,674
<i>that you believe
you will solve your problems</i>

644
00:52:08,676 --> 00:52:10,642
<i>here today with money.</i>

645
00:52:10,644 --> 00:52:12,479
<i>No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.</i>

646
00:52:12,481 --> 00:52:14,680
Your problem's much deeper.

647
00:52:14,682 --> 00:52:19,387
Your problem lies at the very
foundation of this building.

648
00:52:19,389 --> 00:52:21,058
I don't understand.

649
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:23,757
Tell you what, Mr. Shaw.

650
00:52:23,759 --> 00:52:26,560
If you're able to answer one of
three questions correctly,

651
00:52:26,562 --> 00:52:27,532
you live.

652
00:52:28,030 --> 00:52:29,433
If you can't...

653
00:52:35,005 --> 00:52:36,541
he dies.

654
00:52:39,643 --> 00:52:41,176
<i>Please tell me,</i>

655
00:52:41,178 --> 00:52:44,013
<i>who is Jonathan Waters?</i>

656
00:52:46,917 --> 00:52:48,717
You're asking me
about one person

657
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:51,657
of about 250 million people.

658
00:52:52,791 --> 00:52:54,791
I don't think
that's a fair request.

659
00:52:54,793 --> 00:52:56,026
Mr. Shaw, I'll be generous.

660
00:52:56,028 --> 00:52:58,961
Every person I will ask about
is a member of this church.

661
00:52:58,963 --> 00:53:03,768
So again I ask,
who is Jonathan Waters?

662
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:05,437
We have over ten thousand

663
00:53:05,439 --> 00:53:07,607
members of our church,
young man.

664
00:53:09,176 --> 00:53:10,141
<i>Very well.</i>

665
00:53:10,143 --> 00:53:12,576
Mr. Waters is a member here
who lost his job

666
00:53:12,578 --> 00:53:14,611
two years ago
at an aircraft company.

667
00:53:14,613 --> 00:53:16,981
<i>They say he was too qualified.
In other words, too old.</i>

668
00:53:16,983 --> 00:53:17,885
He lost his home

669
00:53:18,952 --> 00:53:20,519
and has reached out
to this church

670
00:53:20,521 --> 00:53:21,954
every day for
the past three months,

671
00:53:21,956 --> 00:53:24,490
and he has been unable to
secure an appointment with you.

672
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:26,691
A homeless member
that has paid ties

673
00:53:26,693 --> 00:53:28,962
in this church for twenty years

674
00:53:28,964 --> 00:53:31,000
<i>can't even get time
with his pastor?</i>

675
00:53:32,633 --> 00:53:36,035
That, Mr. Shaw,
is who Mr. Waters is.

676
00:53:36,037 --> 00:53:37,636
Don't let that soak
in quite yet.

677
00:53:37,638 --> 00:53:40,009
Tell me who
Frances McAdams is.

678
00:53:42,612 --> 00:53:43,747
I don't know.

679
00:53:44,913 --> 00:53:46,847
Frances McAdams is
a member that attended

680
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:48,715
this church for five years.

681
00:53:48,717 --> 00:53:51,620
Her son was snarled by the
horrible beast known as heroin.

682
00:53:51,622 --> 00:53:53,187
And when the youth's pastor
tried to get you to help,

683
00:53:53,189 --> 00:53:54,356
<i>you told them,
"Next week."</i>

684
00:53:54,358 --> 00:53:56,924
<i>Next week turned into
next year, and now,</i>

685
00:53:56,926 --> 00:53:58,193
<i>there is no tomorrow.</i>

686
00:53:59,463 --> 00:54:04,701
You don't know what it's like
to run a church of this size.

687
00:54:04,703 --> 00:54:07,036
And you have no idea

688
00:54:07,038 --> 00:54:10,840
what it's like to
walk a mile in my shoes.

689
00:54:10,842 --> 00:54:11,974
<i>You're right.</i>

690
00:54:11,976 --> 00:54:14,076
I don't know what it's
like to drive a Bentley while

691
00:54:14,078 --> 00:54:16,814
being supported by someone
who can't afford gas.

692
00:54:16,816 --> 00:54:17,981
I don't know
what it's like to live

693
00:54:17,983 --> 00:54:19,249
in a 10,000
square-foot home

694
00:54:19,251 --> 00:54:21,251
with my wife
and one child, no.

695
00:54:21,253 --> 00:54:22,820
<i>I grew up in an
1,800 square-foot</i>

696
00:54:22,822 --> 00:54:24,220
<i>home shared by five people.</i>

697
00:54:24,222 --> 00:54:26,856
And no, I do not know
what it's like to wear suits

698
00:54:26,858 --> 00:54:29,728
that cost more than
my members' full wardrobes.

699
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:32,130
I don't know what it's like
to use my members' money

700
00:54:32,132 --> 00:54:35,866
<i>to house your mistresses,
you're right.</i>

701
00:54:35,868 --> 00:54:39,040
Do you think this is easy?

702
00:54:40,742 --> 00:54:41,743
Huh?

703
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:46,778
What, am I not supposed
to live well?

704
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:49,548
After workin' my
whole life and sacrificin'

705
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:51,220
<i>to build this church?</i>

706
00:54:52,955 --> 00:54:54,857
And its ministry?

707
00:54:55,089 --> 00:54:55,825
Hmm?

708
00:54:57,192 --> 00:55:00,326
So you can sit there all pompous
and judge me for what,

709
00:55:00,328 --> 00:55:01,864
bein' successful?

710
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:05,603
Let me ask you somethin'.

711
00:55:08,637 --> 00:55:10,807
Where are you

712
00:55:11,874 --> 00:55:14,010
when I tend to the burdens

713
00:55:16,714 --> 00:55:18,917
of my hurt flock?

714
00:55:21,785 --> 00:55:22,887
Hmm?

715
00:55:23,988 --> 00:55:26,024
When I'm at my wit's end,

716
00:55:27,326 --> 00:55:29,762
<i>and I suffer their pain
and their strife?</i>

717
00:55:31,295 --> 00:55:32,963
And their darkness,

718
00:55:32,965 --> 00:55:34,731
and I have no one
to talk to,

719
00:55:34,733 --> 00:55:36,132
nowhere to go?

720
00:55:36,134 --> 00:55:38,802
Because I suffer with them.

721
00:55:38,804 --> 00:55:41,973
I bear their burdens with them.

722
00:55:44,209 --> 00:55:45,611
<i>Where are you?</i>

723
00:55:46,245 --> 00:55:48,212
<i>So you're gonna judge me</i>

724
00:55:48,214 --> 00:55:49,249
for my success?

725
00:55:50,115 --> 00:55:51,151
<i>For my possessions?</i>

726
00:55:52,752 --> 00:55:55,222
Well, you don't have the right
to judge me, young man.

727
00:55:57,023 --> 00:55:58,190
You don't have the luxury.

728
00:55:58,192 --> 00:56:02,326
<i>Why don't you go ahead
and cast that stone?</i>

729
00:56:02,328 --> 00:56:04,599
<i>You waltz into my building</i>

730
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,133
with your criminal element,

731
00:56:07,135 --> 00:56:08,968
totin' your guns,

732
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:12,104
<i>killin' our people,
stealin' our money.</i>

733
00:56:12,106 --> 00:56:14,807
And you have the audacity
to point your finger

734
00:56:14,809 --> 00:56:16,846
and call me the bad guy?

735
00:56:17,145 --> 00:56:18,344
Yes.

736
00:56:18,346 --> 00:56:21,281
You mentioned building this
building, this new building.

737
00:56:21,283 --> 00:56:24,621
Perfect transition to
my last question, Mr. Shaw.

738
00:56:25,955 --> 00:56:27,124
Who is Dolores Gentry?

739
00:56:29,992 --> 00:56:31,859
I don't know.

740
00:56:31,861 --> 00:56:33,961
<i>I can't possibly know</i>

741
00:56:33,963 --> 00:56:38,298
the name of every member
of my congregation.

742
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:39,036
It's impossible.

743
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:44,272
"The one who enters by the gate
is the shepherd of the sheep.

744
00:56:44,274 --> 00:56:46,042
"The gatekeepers open
the gate for him,

745
00:56:46,044 --> 00:56:47,777
"and the sheep listen
to his voice.

746
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:51,414
"He calls out his own sheep
by name and leads them out."

747
00:56:51,416 --> 00:56:53,619
I am not God.

748
00:56:56,387 --> 00:56:59,155
Finally, an admission
worth notation.

749
00:56:59,157 --> 00:57:01,157
You are not God.

750
00:57:01,159 --> 00:57:03,863
He owns the heavens,
not you.

751
00:57:05,098 --> 00:57:08,866
<i>Dolores Gentry
is not just a member.</i>

752
00:57:08,868 --> 00:57:11,703
She left you this land to
build this building, and yet,

753
00:57:11,705 --> 00:57:13,136
you did not have the time,

754
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:16,742
the decency to
fill one wish for her.

755
00:57:16,744 --> 00:57:18,876
Just to hold her hand
and pray with her.

756
00:57:18,878 --> 00:57:22,748
She was dying, and you were
being paid to be a celebrity.

757
00:57:34,028 --> 00:57:37,096
Dolores Gentry was my mother.

758
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:43,105
Now.

759
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:30,888
You know what, Mr. Shaw?

760
00:58:33,292 --> 00:58:35,395
I think it's time we
finished this discussion...

761
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:38,299
face to face.

762
00:58:46,474 --> 00:58:48,541
You know this is
all your fault, right?

763
00:58:48,543 --> 00:58:51,011
After all that money
I spent on security,

764
00:58:51,013 --> 00:58:53,245
you told me this church
would be impenetrable.

765
00:58:53,247 --> 00:58:55,350
- Hey.
- Now look at us.

766
00:58:57,018 --> 00:58:58,919
You lay this at my feet.

767
00:58:58,921 --> 00:59:01,187
Who do you think
you're grabbin', huh?

768
00:59:01,189 --> 00:59:05,392
I gave you a push,
a nudge in the right direction.

769
00:59:05,394 --> 00:59:06,994
And you're the one that
called attention to this.

770
00:59:06,996 --> 00:59:08,496
You're the one with all the
bling and the cars

771
00:59:08,498 --> 00:59:09,530
- and the money.
- Yeah.

772
00:59:09,532 --> 00:59:11,298
You're the one that's
supposed to keep us safe!

773
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:13,900
You're delusional, man.
You're delusional!

774
00:59:13,902 --> 00:59:15,169
<i>I'm tired
of listening to you.</i>

775
00:59:15,171 --> 00:59:16,171
<i>He's delusional.</i>

776
00:59:16,173 --> 00:59:18,073
Shut up!

777
00:59:18,075 --> 00:59:19,174
It's now or never.

778
00:59:21,845 --> 00:59:22,944
Shut up!

779
00:59:22,946 --> 00:59:24,245
Shut up!

780
00:59:24,247 --> 00:59:25,015
Now.

781
00:59:25,549 --> 00:59:27,416
Shut up!

782
00:59:27,418 --> 00:59:29,184
Ahh!

783
00:59:56,583 --> 00:59:57,585
Wait.

784
00:59:59,286 --> 01:00:00,221
Wait.

785
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:02,087
Wait.

786
01:00:06,093 --> 01:00:07,329
I'll get you Shaw.

787
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:12,066
I'll kill Bishop, too.

788
01:00:14,401 --> 01:00:16,406
<i>I know this place
better than anyone.</i>

789
01:00:18,073 --> 01:00:19,241
Your price?

790
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:23,545
My life.

791
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:40,965
Don't worry,
I'll protect you.

792
01:00:55,646 --> 01:00:57,415
Shannon!

793
01:00:58,215 --> 01:00:59,018
Mommy!

794
01:00:59,784 --> 01:01:01,617
- Come here.
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>

795
01:01:01,619 --> 01:01:04,087
I'm sorry!
I'm so sorry.

796
01:01:04,089 --> 01:01:05,422
- Wait, Laura.
- <i>Let's go.</i>

797
01:01:05,424 --> 01:01:07,290
No... Laura?
Don't leave me, don't leave me!

798
01:01:07,292 --> 01:01:08,327
No, come back!

799
01:01:15,001 --> 01:01:16,668
I'll get you out of here.
Let's go.

800
01:01:19,139 --> 01:01:20,505
<i>Go, take her. Take her.</i>

801
01:01:20,507 --> 01:01:22,175
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

802
01:01:27,481 --> 01:01:29,482
You can't run from
the imposters.

803
01:01:29,484 --> 01:01:32,218
I'm ready.
Are you?

804
01:01:34,089 --> 01:01:36,125
Come on.

805
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:40,326
- I'm trying.
- What about Papa?

806
01:01:40,328 --> 01:01:42,730
You're a quitter.
You're quitting on him.

807
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:44,764
You're quitting on me.
You're a quitter.

808
01:01:44,766 --> 01:01:47,534
You're safe, alright?
I have to get you out of here.

809
01:01:47,536 --> 01:01:48,271
Okay?

810
01:01:49,605 --> 01:01:51,638
I just need you to do
this big girl thing for me.

811
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:54,209
I promise you.
I promise you.

812
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:56,243
<i>And I need you to run
till you see the police,</i>

813
01:01:56,245 --> 01:01:58,446
<i>and I need you to...
don't stop.</i>

814
01:01:58,448 --> 01:02:00,015
Come on.
Do this for me.

815
01:02:00,017 --> 01:02:01,483
No.

816
01:02:01,485 --> 01:02:04,119
<i>Please, come on.
Come on. Baby, come on.</i>

817
01:02:04,121 --> 01:02:06,357
I love you so much.

818
01:02:18,070 --> 01:02:19,639
No, no.

819
01:02:21,305 --> 01:02:24,240
I'm sorry.

820
01:02:24,242 --> 01:02:26,576
Please, please.

821
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:30,815
<i>Move.</i>

822
01:03:39,624 --> 01:03:42,258
<i>Stand down.
I'm bringing in Shaw.</i>

823
01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:43,794
<i>I'll bring you Bishop, too.</i>

824
01:03:43,796 --> 01:03:46,099
I just need your word
I leave here alive.

825
01:03:51,471 --> 01:03:52,806
We got a deal?

826
01:03:56,176 --> 01:03:58,710
You're a strange fella,
you know that?

827
01:03:58,712 --> 01:04:02,380
You were willing to help me
catch him just to save yourself?

828
01:04:02,382 --> 01:04:04,453
Everything I do is
about survival.

829
01:04:08,356 --> 01:04:09,624
Have a seat.

830
01:04:17,399 --> 01:04:18,701
Yo, Mark.

831
01:04:20,835 --> 01:04:22,237
<i>You're fired.</i>

832
01:04:27,677 --> 01:04:29,780
Man fired the man.

833
01:04:44,962 --> 01:04:46,730
So the question...

834
01:04:48,332 --> 01:04:52,568
about what it is I want
has been lingering in the air.

835
01:04:52,570 --> 01:04:55,540
I think it's time now
I provide you with an answer.

836
01:04:56,974 --> 01:04:58,907
You will never profit
off another person,

837
01:04:58,909 --> 01:05:00,976
betray another person,
and I will make sure

838
01:05:00,978 --> 01:05:03,549
<i>no one will ever mistake you
to be a god.</i>

839
01:05:07,819 --> 01:05:09,486
How you plannin' on doin' that?

840
01:05:09,488 --> 01:05:12,355
By confessin' our sins,
Reverend.

841
01:05:12,357 --> 01:05:15,293
<i>He is faithful and just.</i>

842
01:05:15,295 --> 01:05:17,728
He is the atoning sacrifice
for our sins.

843
01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:19,664
<i>But not just ours, Reverend.</i>

844
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:21,702
<i>But the sins of the
whole world.</i>

845
01:05:24,270 --> 01:05:26,439
So you want me to
atone for my sins?

846
01:05:26,441 --> 01:05:29,741
So you actually do
know the scriptures.

847
01:05:29,743 --> 01:05:31,343
Yes, Reverend.

848
01:05:31,345 --> 01:05:33,414
I want you to atone
for your sins.

849
01:05:35,015 --> 01:05:37,616
I want you to look into
that camera over there,

850
01:05:37,618 --> 01:05:39,388
and tell your flock.

851
01:05:42,690 --> 01:05:44,761
Atone for your sins.

852
01:05:55,905 --> 01:05:57,441
<i>Or we all die.</i>

853
01:06:00,644 --> 01:06:02,681
You're gonna give
that choice to me?

854
01:06:08,419 --> 01:06:09,888
You are sharp.

855
01:06:11,656 --> 01:06:13,291
Very smart.

856
01:06:16,461 --> 01:06:19,396
Only you can't die a martyr.

857
01:06:19,398 --> 01:06:20,829
Mm-mmm.

858
01:06:20,831 --> 01:06:23,966
Martyr has to die
with no choice.

859
01:06:23,968 --> 01:06:26,569
A true martyr dies

860
01:06:26,571 --> 01:06:29,306
with faith in everything
that he believes, no options.

861
01:06:29,308 --> 01:06:31,042
You, son, have a choice.

862
01:06:31,044 --> 01:06:32,743
<i>So if you want to die
out of the grandeur,</i>

863
01:06:32,745 --> 01:06:34,312
<i>that's on you.</i>

864
01:06:34,314 --> 01:06:36,950
You think this is
about me, hmm?

865
01:06:38,485 --> 01:06:39,487
<i>Isn't it?</i>

866
01:06:58,006 --> 01:07:01,410
Looks like you have run
out of places to hide.

867
01:07:05,514 --> 01:07:06,883
<i>I think you took a wrong turn.</i>

868
01:07:07,849 --> 01:07:09,286
<i>I know where I am.</i>

869
01:07:09,884 --> 01:07:11,784
But more importantly,

870
01:07:11,786 --> 01:07:13,455
I know where you die.

871
01:07:15,859 --> 01:07:17,424
<i>I hope you know
how to use those.</i>

872
01:07:43,088 --> 01:07:43,990
Ah!

873
01:09:31,538 --> 01:09:33,742
<i>Come on, Laura.</i>

874
01:10:30,903 --> 01:10:32,135
Bishop!

875
01:10:58,666 --> 01:11:01,570
You think this is
about me, hmm?

876
01:11:02,704 --> 01:11:03,206
<i>Isn't it?</i>

877
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:06,609
<i>I mean, you come
in here pullin' triggers.</i>

878
01:11:08,109 --> 01:11:10,546
Killin' my people,
took all that money.

879
01:11:11,646 --> 01:11:13,716
Spittin' judgements at me.

880
01:11:14,818 --> 01:11:17,085
<i>You have the means
to the money.</i>

881
01:11:17,087 --> 01:11:18,752
<i>You have your own agenda,</i>

882
01:11:18,754 --> 01:11:21,822
and you're usin' your
poor mother as justification...

883
01:11:21,824 --> 01:11:23,894
<i>You don't
know anything about me.</i>

884
01:11:25,828 --> 01:11:27,863
You think that money was for me?

885
01:11:27,865 --> 01:11:29,067
It wasn't for me.

886
01:11:29,734 --> 01:11:30,267
Right now,

887
01:11:31,334 --> 01:11:34,068
there are groups
that actually care,

888
01:11:34,070 --> 01:11:38,610
receiving anonymous donations
that will total $14 million.

889
01:11:40,144 --> 01:11:42,678
So how could it be about me...

890
01:11:47,052 --> 01:11:49,218
when I never planned
on leaving alive?

891
01:11:58,296 --> 01:12:00,067
<i>This timer stops</i>

892
01:12:01,867 --> 01:12:03,704
only once you confess.

893
01:12:18,919 --> 01:12:19,922
This land

894
01:12:20,989 --> 01:12:23,221
belongs to the blood
of my ancestors,

895
01:12:23,223 --> 01:12:25,958
and this building will not stand

896
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:28,095
as long as you're pastor.

897
01:12:37,138 --> 01:12:38,306
I'll quit.

898
01:12:38,308 --> 01:12:40,176
You'll quit.

899
01:12:43,045 --> 01:12:44,347
It's too late for that.

900
01:13:01,866 --> 01:13:05,801
<i>You will confess
live to your members</i>

901
01:13:05,803 --> 01:13:07,272
and to the world.

902
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:10,506
And then this stops,

903
01:13:10,508 --> 01:13:12,377
and I bid you farewell.

904
01:13:41,108 --> 01:13:44,878
I, Reverend Mark Shaw,
confess

905
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:48,447
to not up-upholding
the standard

906
01:13:48,449 --> 01:13:50,483
entrusted in me

907
01:13:50,485 --> 01:13:52,722
by the Christian church,

908
01:13:53,456 --> 01:13:56,258
<i>loved ones, and my creator.</i>

909
01:14:08,137 --> 01:14:10,971
To my wife, Jenny,

910
01:14:18,516 --> 01:14:20,949
I have not been faithful to you.

911
01:14:20,951 --> 01:14:22,253
I broke our covenant.

912
01:14:27,326 --> 01:14:29,325
And I know that the
revelation of this news

913
01:14:29,327 --> 01:14:31,196
is gonna cause
great harm to you,

914
01:14:32,298 --> 01:14:33,532
to my son.

915
01:14:34,834 --> 01:14:38,102
<i>I'm truly sorry</i>

916
01:14:38,104 --> 01:14:40,437
to my church members.

917
01:14:40,439 --> 01:14:42,307
I have allowed
earthly possessions

918
01:14:42,309 --> 01:14:44,241
to cloud my spiritual calling.

919
01:14:44,243 --> 01:14:46,210
<i>I came to believe that</i>

920
01:14:46,212 --> 01:14:48,545
<i>the measure of my success</i>

921
01:14:48,547 --> 01:14:51,916
<i>was measured by
the things that I owned.</i>

922
01:14:51,918 --> 01:14:56,221
Honestly, I started to
worship my own shine,

923
01:14:56,223 --> 01:14:58,858
<i>and I am ashamed of that.</i>

924
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:00,095
<i>Truly ashamed.</i>

925
01:15:01,462 --> 01:15:05,931
And when you trusted me most,
I turned my back on you.

926
01:15:05,933 --> 01:15:09,070
And there's no way
I can make amends for that.

927
01:15:15,077 --> 01:15:18,346
The events that have transpired
on this godforsaken Friday

928
01:15:18,348 --> 01:15:21,181
<i>have caused much harm.</i>

929
01:15:30,426 --> 01:15:31,328
<i>But most of all,</i>

930
01:15:32,363 --> 01:15:35,366
I didn't uphold my
responsibility

931
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:44,076
<i>to God.</i>

932
01:15:46,243 --> 01:15:49,113
<i>And I got nobody to blame
but myself.</i>

933
01:16:00,025 --> 01:16:01,193
I...

934
01:16:07,968 --> 01:16:10,938
I don't deserve the title
of Reverend.

935
01:16:15,009 --> 01:16:16,444
May God forgive me.

936
01:16:31,327 --> 01:16:32,625
<i>Let me go.</i>

937
01:16:32,627 --> 01:16:34,527
<i>No, I'm not letting go.</i>

938
01:16:34,529 --> 01:16:36,196
Laura!

939
01:16:40,169 --> 01:16:41,004
Try.

940
01:16:41,604 --> 01:16:43,507
Laura, I'm too heavy.

941
01:16:46,409 --> 01:16:49,613
<i>Come on, you gotta try.
Please.</i>

942
01:16:55,386 --> 01:16:57,388
You didn't fail me.

943
01:16:58,556 --> 01:17:01,293
You did everything
you could humanly do.

944
01:17:03,428 --> 01:17:06,532
- <i>David, you're slipping. No!</i>
- Find God.

945
01:17:07,765 --> 01:17:09,969
The world needs you.

946
01:17:11,036 --> 01:17:11,935
I need you.

947
01:17:11,937 --> 01:17:15,339
- You can't do this alone.
- No!

948
01:17:15,341 --> 01:17:17,711
No! No!

949
01:17:44,506 --> 01:17:47,142
Can you please stop
the timer now,

950
01:17:48,243 --> 01:17:49,511
Courtney?

951
01:17:53,315 --> 01:17:55,352
You remember my name.

952
01:17:56,218 --> 01:17:57,620
Lowly janitor.

953
01:18:06,263 --> 01:18:07,430
Yes.

954
01:18:09,131 --> 01:18:10,734
I remember you.

955
01:18:15,338 --> 01:18:17,141
Please turn it off.

956
01:18:20,177 --> 01:18:21,380
Please.

957
01:18:22,779 --> 01:18:24,315
I won't.

958
01:18:32,123 --> 01:18:33,358
Reverend.

959
01:18:35,394 --> 01:18:37,327
I want you to know that
out of all the lives

960
01:18:37,329 --> 01:18:38,399
that were destroyed today,

961
01:18:40,365 --> 01:18:42,499
yours means the least to me.

962
01:18:57,750 --> 01:18:58,685
Hello, Bishop.

963
01:19:00,321 --> 01:19:01,855
And here I thought

964
01:19:01,857 --> 01:19:03,426
you were no longer with us.

965
01:19:07,595 --> 01:19:08,630
<i>I told you</i>

966
01:19:09,497 --> 01:19:10,366
I was gonna see you.

967
01:19:50,843 --> 01:19:52,545
You just won't die.

968
01:20:34,589 --> 01:20:35,324
Laura.

969
01:21:03,654 --> 01:21:05,621
Protects the heart, right?

970
01:21:05,623 --> 01:21:06,723
Yeah.

971
01:21:06,725 --> 01:21:10,460
I thought... I thought
you didn't know how to shoot.

972
01:21:12,864 --> 01:21:14,401
Lucky shot.

973
01:21:17,503 --> 01:21:19,539
No such thing as luck.

974
01:21:22,475 --> 01:21:23,677
Shh.

975
01:21:24,776 --> 01:21:26,780
Shh, shh, shh.

976
01:21:33,187 --> 01:21:37,455
That you're a hero
and my friend.

977
01:22:14,732 --> 01:22:15,700
Shit!

978
01:22:54,374 --> 01:22:54,975
Oh, my God.

979
01:23:08,021 --> 01:23:10,756
Come on. Get up,
we gotta go.

980
01:23:10,758 --> 01:23:12,591
Laura, that you?

981
01:23:12,593 --> 01:23:13,761
I'm your daughter.

982
01:23:13,763 --> 01:23:16,963
- Come on. We gotta go.
- I can't.

983
01:23:16,965 --> 01:23:18,668
- I'm too heavy.
- No.

984
01:23:19,934 --> 01:23:24,872
I just never could lose
these last ten pounds.

985
01:23:28,444 --> 01:23:29,112
Please.

986
01:23:32,148 --> 01:23:34,352
I'm not leaving you.

987
01:23:37,153 --> 01:23:39,988
Laura, sometimes...

988
01:23:39,990 --> 01:23:43,558
sometimes you just have
to have faith.

989
01:25:13,826 --> 01:25:15,558
<i>Many people turned
away from the church</i>

990
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:17,194
<i>after Shaw's confession.</i>

991
01:25:17,196 --> 01:25:18,898
<i>I was angry, too.</i>

992
01:25:19,732 --> 01:25:20,899
<i>For a while.</i>

993
01:25:21,599 --> 01:25:22,999
<i>But in the end,</i>

994
01:25:23,001 --> 01:25:25,134
<i>I chose to remember him
as he was</i>

995
01:25:25,136 --> 01:25:27,871
<i>when I first heard him preach.</i>

996
01:25:27,873 --> 01:25:29,741
<i>He was somethin'.</i>

997
01:25:29,743 --> 01:25:31,942
<i>That's why nothin',</i>

998
01:25:31,944 --> 01:25:35,847
and I mean nothin' in God's
world happens by mistake.

999
01:25:35,849 --> 01:25:37,849
Everything's for a reason.

1000
01:25:37,851 --> 01:25:40,685
<i>Nobody ever promised us
that life would be easy.</i>

1001
01:25:40,687 --> 01:25:43,154
<i>If life were easy,
there'd be no value in it.</i>

1002
01:25:43,156 --> 01:25:46,891
So the key is to pray for
the knowledge of God's will,

1003
01:25:46,893 --> 01:25:49,127
nothin' more, nothin' less,
nothin' else,

1004
01:25:49,129 --> 01:25:50,932
and the power
to carry that out.

1005
01:25:52,634 --> 01:25:54,136
- Faith and action.
- <i>Amen.</i>

1006
01:25:55,571 --> 01:25:57,737
I'm here to tell you
no one gets to the Father

1007
01:25:57,739 --> 01:25:59,706
but through the Son.
Amen.

1008
01:25:59,708 --> 01:26:00,742
<i>Amen.</i>

1009
01:26:01,810 --> 01:26:03,843
Life is not
about the destination,

1010
01:26:03,845 --> 01:26:06,580
it is about the journey.

1011
01:26:06,582 --> 01:26:10,083
And sometimes the journey
can seem bleak, dark, hopeless.

1012
01:26:10,085 --> 01:26:12,919
<i>It can feel like it
has no meaning.</i>

1013
01:26:12,921 --> 01:26:16,124
And that's when you turn to the
one who gives all meaning.

1014
01:26:16,126 --> 01:26:19,361
And that one is God.
May you find Him right now.

1015
01:26:19,363 --> 01:26:22,164
<i>Y'all remember to be
grateful this week.</i>

1016
01:26:22,166 --> 01:26:24,700
See how you can be of
maximum service to God

1017
01:26:24,702 --> 01:26:27,370
and to your fellow
brothers and sisters,

1018
01:26:27,372 --> 01:26:29,906
and rejoice in each day.

1019
01:26:29,908 --> 01:26:32,308
And I'll see you all
next week, same time.

1020
01:26:32,310 --> 01:26:33,475
<i>Thank you.</i>

1021
01:26:33,477 --> 01:26:35,777
<i>Not a day goes
by that I don't think of</i>

1022
01:26:35,779 --> 01:26:39,382
<i>everyone who lost
their life that night.</i>

1023
01:26:39,384 --> 01:26:43,720
<i>My dad's smile is forever
etched in my memory.</i>

1024
01:26:43,722 --> 01:26:46,657
<i>He made me promise
to take care of Kate.</i>

1025
01:26:46,659 --> 01:26:49,296
<i>That's the easiest promise
I've ever made.</i>

1026
01:26:58,304 --> 01:27:00,171
<i>I have lost</i>

1027
01:27:00,173 --> 01:27:03,142
<i>a lot of people dear to me.</i>

1028
01:27:03,144 --> 01:27:05,811
<i>Some people wonder
why we should live</i>

1029
01:27:05,813 --> 01:27:08,813
<i>if we're destined to die.</i>

1030
01:27:08,815 --> 01:27:11,049
<i>But the challenge
is to live</i>

1031
01:27:11,051 --> 01:27:13,922
<i>so a part of us never dies.</i>

1032
01:27:33,976 --> 01:27:37,279
Morning, sunshine cupcake.

1033
01:27:37,281 --> 01:27:40,149
Morning,
sunshine Kool-aid.

1034
01:27:46,824 --> 01:27:48,423
<i>I'm healing</i>

1035
01:27:48,425 --> 01:27:52,865
<i>physically, mentally,
and spiritually.</i>

1036
01:27:53,999 --> 01:27:56,199
<i>I'm a work in progress,</i>

1037
01:27:56,201 --> 01:27:58,435
<i>but I'll be ready
to take on anything</i>

1038
01:27:58,437 --> 01:28:01,772
<i>that the world has
to throw at me.</i>

1039
01:28:01,774 --> 01:28:04,945
<i>If you ever find yourself
in need of help,</i>

1040
01:28:06,179 --> 01:28:07,911
<i>I know a good woman.</i>
