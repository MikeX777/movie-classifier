was Voroshilov and Khrushchev even.

00:10:53,729 --> 00:10:56,732
Marx was particularly labor intensive

228
00:10:56,765 --> 00:10:59,068
because he had long, curly hair

they told him that he has to help find me

00:47:33,727 --> 00:47:35,662
...Gary Cooper double-breasted suit,

911
00:47:35,695 --> 00:47:37,364
which I was carrying with me

912
00:47:37,397 --> 00:47:39,199
just for the occasion of liberation

913
00:47:39,232 --> 00:47:41,401
so I can dress up very nicely

914
00:47:41,434 --> 00:47:44,905
and join the free world again looking like something.

915
00:47:44,938 --> 00:47:47,240
It was an extraordinary journey because...

916
00:47:47,274 --> 00:47:50,777
...there were masses of humanity...

917
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:53,580
...on the road, day and night,

918
00:47:53,613 --> 00:47:56,082
running away from the Russians.

919
00:47:56,116 --> 00:47:58,385
I can't even tell you the mixture.

920
00:47:58,418 --> 00:48:00,187
There were former enemies,

921
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:01,755
there was the SS,

922
00:48:01,788 --> 00:48:03,423
there was escaped prisoner of war,

923
00:48:03,456 --> 00:48:06,326
there were concentration camp inmates,

924
00:48:06,359 --> 00:48:08,929
there were Jews, Poles,

925
00:48:08,962 --> 00:48:11,231
uh, Italians,

926
00:48:11,264 --> 00:48:12,699
Romanian Air Force,

927
00:48:12,732 --> 00:48:15,502
I mean, the whole mixture of people

928
00:48:15,535 --> 00:48:18,471
who became subjugated

929
00:48:18,505 --> 00:48:20,273
by the Germans or the Nazis

930
00:48:20,307 --> 00:48:22,309
or collaborated with them,

931
00:48:22,342 --> 00:48:25,078
now escaping jointly, saying, "Okay,

932
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:27,747
we'll settle our differences later.

933
00:48:27,781 --> 00:48:30,250
Now, let's get out of harm's way now."

934
00:48:30,283 --> 00:48:33,486
Nearing the River Enns...

935
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,889
...I put my rucksack on the little...

936
00:48:35,922 --> 00:48:39,526
...horse-drawn wagon of some Hungarians who had it,

937
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:41,127
and I went forward on foot.

938
00:48:41,161 --> 00:48:42,462
People from the back started yelling

939
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,464
that the Russian tanks were coming

940
00:48:44,497 --> 00:48:47,334
and true enough looking back, I could see,

941
00:48:47,367 --> 00:48:49,703
from a distance, the dust clouds

942
00:48:49,736 --> 00:48:52,138
of the Russian tanks were making on the road.

943
00:48:52,172 --> 00:48:53,640
I said, "Well,

944
00:48:53,673 --> 00:48:56,243
I'm just now going to wait for them."

945
00:48:56,276 --> 00:48:57,777
I could see, crossing the bridge,

946
00:48:57,811 --> 00:48:59,279
that they were American tanks

947
00:48:59,312 --> 00:49:01,281
and American military vehicles

948
00:49:01,314 --> 00:49:02,482
on the other side.

949
00:49:02,515 --> 00:49:03,750
I ran across the bridge,

950
00:49:03,783 --> 00:49:06,353
just about collapsed at the feet of a--

951
00:49:06,386 --> 00:49:08,154
of an American soldier.

952
00:49:08,188 --> 00:49:10,924
He helped me, and I said in perfect English, you know,

953
00:49:10,957 --> 00:49:13,226
"Thank you very much," you know, sort of, "thank you."

954
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:15,729
He was absolutely amazed that he found such a nice boy

955
00:49:15,762 --> 00:49:18,331
who spoke English

956
00:49:18,365 --> 00:49:19,833
and, uh,

957
00:49:19,866 --> 00:49:23,770
went in to his vehicle, got me a first taste of whiskey,

958
00:49:23,803 --> 00:49:25,138
and that was that.

959
00:49:26,139 --> 00:49:28,341
German army units, with their officers,

960
00:49:28,375 --> 00:49:30,543
with their vehicles, that came across,

961
00:49:30,577 --> 00:49:33,213
ready to go into prisoner of war camps,

962
00:49:33,246 --> 00:49:35,148
this being the first moment,

963
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:38,618
so the American officers, and MPs, and Jeeps

964
00:49:38,652 --> 00:49:41,554
were herding them like shepherds.

965
00:49:41,588 --> 00:49:44,024
In fact was a total chaos.

966
00:49:44,057 --> 00:49:45,759
This obviously was a front unit,

967
00:49:45,792 --> 00:49:48,028
there was a colonel and other American officers

968
00:49:48,061 --> 00:49:50,430
and there were German officers

969
00:49:50,463 --> 00:49:53,667
who were reporting to them and asking for instructions.

970
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,302
They starting translating.

971
00:49:55,335 --> 00:49:57,237
They were high ranking German officers, I think,

972
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:58,605
there was even a General

973
00:49:58,638 --> 00:50:01,741
asking me to please tell the American officer

974
00:50:01,775 --> 00:50:03,576
this and this, and this one would tell him that,

975
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:05,979
and I said, "Well, that's the place to be."

976
00:50:06,012 --> 00:50:08,381
I looked at myself and I looked absolutely awful.

977
00:50:08,415 --> 00:50:10,483
I looked around, nowhere could I find

978
00:50:10,517 --> 00:50:12,519
my Hungarian cart with my suit,

979
00:50:12,552 --> 00:50:16,790
in this dirty old Organization Todt uniform,

980
00:50:16,823 --> 00:50:20,694
which looked suspiciously like an army uniform

981
00:50:20,727 --> 00:50:23,463
and I figured out, the quicker I get out of it

982
00:50:23,496 --> 00:50:24,698
the better

983
00:50:24,731 --> 00:50:27,400
because somebody's going to stick me into the wrong,

984
00:50:27,434 --> 00:50:28,835
you know, compartment here

985
00:50:28,868 --> 00:50:31,204
and I'll find myself in a German camp.

986
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:32,706
I went into town,

987
00:50:32,739 --> 00:50:34,541
looking how I could get myself

988
00:50:34,574 --> 00:50:36,209
something to wear.

989
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:39,145
Walking the street I saw Men's Tailor,

990
00:50:39,179 --> 00:50:41,214
Herrenschneiderei.

991
00:50:41,247 --> 00:50:42,248
Knock, knock.

992
00:50:42,282 --> 00:50:43,783
Finally somebody opened, they said,

993
00:50:43,817 --> 00:50:46,786
"Look, there's nothing, absolutely nothing.

994
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:49,756
There's no clothes, no suits, zero",

995
00:50:49,789 --> 00:50:52,459
and tried to close it in front of my face

996
00:50:52,492 --> 00:50:57,097
at which point I produced my P38.

997
00:50:57,130 --> 00:50:59,532
He opened it, realized I was not going to shoot him

998
00:50:59,566 --> 00:51:01,901
and in perfect German, I said, "Look, I just need a suit."

999
00:51:01,935 --> 00:51:04,204
"I don't have any more. Well let's see what I have."

1000
00:51:04,237 --> 00:51:07,040
Took me down to his, uh, workplace

1001
00:51:07,073 --> 00:51:10,777
and indeed there were a lot of...

1002
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:14,414
...mostly uniforms, which were not collected,

1003
00:51:14,447 --> 00:51:18,518
never will be, you know of various Nazi officials

1004
00:51:18,551 --> 00:51:22,288
and a few private suits sort of finished were hanging there.

1005
00:51:22,322 --> 00:51:24,257
I found one, which...

1006
00:51:25,525 --> 00:51:28,395
...just about fitted me, I was pretty skinny in those days.

1007
00:51:28,428 --> 00:51:30,563
Maybe it was not my Gary Cooper suit,

1008
00:51:30,597 --> 00:51:32,499
but I certainly looked different

1009
00:51:32,532 --> 00:51:35,101
that what I did when I arrived.

1010
00:51:35,135 --> 00:51:38,338
I, uh, went back looking for my...

1011
00:51:38,371 --> 00:51:40,407
...American officers

1012
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,442
and they suggested

1013
00:51:42,475 --> 00:51:45,578
that I should go further north

1014
00:51:45,612 --> 00:51:47,747
where there were headquarters

1015
00:51:47,781 --> 00:51:50,950
of the Counter Intelligence Corps,

1016
00:51:50,984 --> 00:51:52,652
uh, for the 20th Corps,

1017
00:51:52,685 --> 00:51:56,289
who they were sure could use my services

1018
00:51:56,322 --> 00:51:58,224
as an interpreter.

1019
00:51:58,258 --> 00:52:00,960
That'll be 35 Russian,

1020
00:52:00,994 --> 00:52:02,462
12 Belgians,

1021
00:52:02,495 --> 00:52:04,097
three French,

1022
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:05,999
and three Yugoslavs.

1023
00:52:06,032 --> 00:52:08,234
How many of those are women?

1024
00:52:08,268 --> 00:52:10,069
28 Russian women...

1025
00:52:11,671 --> 00:52:14,107
...and 11 Belgian boys with a priest.

1026
00:52:15,175 --> 00:52:16,910
Yes sir, we'll be ready for them.

1027
00:52:16,943 --> 00:52:18,645
There were very few linguists

1028
00:52:18,678 --> 00:52:21,047
really in the CIC, unfortunately.

1029
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:23,082
I was very welcome.

1030
00:52:23,116 --> 00:52:26,152
So, at the end of the day,

1031
00:52:26,186 --> 00:52:28,688
I was safely,

1032
00:52:28,721 --> 00:52:30,156
in a clean bed

1033
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:33,660
as part of an American unit.

1034
00:52:33,693 --> 00:52:35,829
So, it was...

1035
00:52:35,862 --> 00:52:38,064
...a very long day, but in a way a very happy day,

1036
00:52:38,097 --> 00:52:41,267
so that was the end of the war for me.

1037
00:52:42,769 --> 00:52:46,139
[quiet dramatic music ♪]

1038
00:52:46,172 --> 00:52:49,108
The first few days after the war was extraordinary.

1039
00:52:49,142 --> 00:52:52,212
The bridges on the autobahn were blown up.

1040
00:52:52,245 --> 00:52:55,715
The remnants of war material was still on the road,

1041
00:52:55,748 --> 00:52:58,184
there were shot up tanks

1042
00:52:58,218 --> 00:52:59,719
and a lot of German planes

1043
00:52:59,752 --> 00:53:04,157
were using the autobahns as landing and starting places

1044
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:07,727
were pushed and parked still on both sides of the...

1045
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,729
...of the autobahns.

1046
00:53:11,231 --> 00:53:13,433
Having lost my entire family,

1047
00:53:13,466 --> 00:53:17,337
I enjoyed seeing a defeated Germany...

1048
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:19,973
...and they were truly defeated.

1049
00:53:20,974 --> 00:53:22,942
There was chaos, there was no food,

1050
00:53:22,976 --> 00:53:25,211
there was millions of...

1051
00:53:25,245 --> 00:53:27,413
...refugees milling about, not only Germans,

1052
00:53:27,447 --> 00:53:30,416
but also the other nationalities of which...

1053
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:32,852
...the Germans had brought into Germany as forced labor.

1054
00:53:32,886 --> 00:53:35,522
There were inmates of concentration camps,

1055
00:53:35,555 --> 00:53:38,424
every nationality had to be dealt with.

1056
00:53:38,458 --> 00:53:41,561
Allied forces determined that

1057
00:53:41,594 --> 00:53:43,263
anybody who has held certain rank,

1058
00:53:43,296 --> 00:53:45,164
above a certain level,

1059
00:53:45,198 --> 00:53:46,766
in any party or...

1060
00:53:48,001 --> 00:53:51,938
...military or paramilitary, or SS, Gestapo organization

1061
00:53:51,971 --> 00:53:55,074
was to be automatically arrested,

1062
00:53:55,108 --> 00:53:56,843
thrown into an internment camp,

1063
00:53:56,876 --> 00:53:58,878
later to be dealt with.

1064
00:53:58,912 --> 00:54:01,414
We had more than our hands full,

1065
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:05,118
uh, just simply arresting people.

1066
00:54:05,151 --> 00:54:08,354
Very shortly, I was officially pronounced

1067
00:54:08,388 --> 00:54:10,523
as an acting agent...

1068
00:54:11,524 --> 00:54:13,293
...in the Counter-Intelligence Corps.

1069
00:54:13,326 --> 00:54:15,995
I was given the privilege of wearing an officer's uniform

1070
00:54:16,029 --> 00:54:17,497
with the insignia

1071
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:19,299
and save for the fact

1072
00:54:19,332 --> 00:54:21,301
that I was not an American citizen,

1073
00:54:21,334 --> 00:54:24,804
had the same duties and responsibilities

1074
00:54:24,837 --> 00:54:28,074
and the privileges of other American agents.

1075
00:54:28,107 --> 00:54:31,144
Our powers were absolutely unlimited at the time.

1076
00:54:31,177 --> 00:54:34,948
I would go to the office and pick up my days work,

1077
00:54:34,981 --> 00:54:40,219
and by myself with a big .45 pistol,

1078
00:54:40,253 --> 00:54:42,689
which was very, uh, persuasive

1079
00:54:42,722 --> 00:54:46,292
because it was very large, and a pair of handcuffs.

1080
00:54:46,326 --> 00:54:49,028
I would take off and, uh, arrest people,

1081
00:54:49,062 --> 00:54:50,964
give them, very politely,

1082
00:54:50,997 --> 00:54:53,933
give them three minutes to pack up their things,

1083
00:54:53,967 --> 00:54:56,102
say goodbye to their families,

1084
00:54:56,135 --> 00:54:58,738
which was more than they used to give me in my day,

1085
00:54:58,771 --> 00:55:00,173
then back them into a Jeep

1086
00:55:00,206 --> 00:55:03,743
and bring them to the prison in Starnberg.

1087
00:55:03,776 --> 00:55:05,745
At one time I actually lost my temper.

1088
00:55:05,778 --> 00:55:08,147
Otherwise, I tried to be very level-headed,

1089
00:55:08,181 --> 00:55:11,184

1096

1131
