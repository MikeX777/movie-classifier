21
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,864
A holy vow

22
00:01:56,491 --> 00:02:01,162
A world that casts you out,
forgives you

23
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:04,165
And those who blame you

24
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,168
Sing your praises now

25
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,586

Yeah, yeah, yeah

32
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,065
To all the critics out there,
l know they're going to review this,

33
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,192
and l know they're
gonna try to knock me--

34
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,695
is it okay if l say this
to camera, Amber?

35
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:36,281
l only am who l am
'cause l was born that way.

36
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:41,494
l have a gift, and l'm trying not
to be selfish about it, but to use it.

37
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:44,581
lf you're gonna knock me for that,
that's your problem.

38
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:48,168
Jealousy will get you nowhere.
And l'm gonna keep rockin' on.

There's hope for me,
there's a prophecy

42
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:06,978
Destiny

43
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:10,565
A world that casts you out

44
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,194
May forgive you now

45
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:19,074
Destiny

46
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,577
l've been waiting for a sign

47
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,498
To ease my troubled mind

48
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,169
Ellen, what's the matter with you?

49
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,963
Don't tell Mom l'm taking you
to your stupid junior prom.

50
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:35,590
Get out of here!

51
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,801
Your brother!
How gross is that?

52
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,469
They don't know
you're my brother.

53
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,180
Please, Ben.
You have to. l'll pay you.

54
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:45,392
Find someone
who's not related to you.

55
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,768
Loser.

56
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,583

Yeah, yeah, yeah

62
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:08,183
How shall l see you
through my tears?

63
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:11,394
When l'm crying tears of sadness

64
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:14,189
How shall l see you
through my tears?

65
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:17,192
Won't you turn them
into tears of gladness?

66
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:20,862
How shall l see you
through my tears?

67
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,867
Yeah, yeah, yeah

68
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,577
Tears

69
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,103
What are you doing here?
Aren't you, like, 30?

70
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,397
Come on!

71
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,778
Excuse me, is there someplace
we're supposed to check in?

72
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,196
Over there.

73
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,491
- ls this your first summer?
- l was here last year.

74
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:09,369
Remember? We were in
Night. Mother together.

75
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,082
You're Jill Simmons.
My name's Fritzi.

76
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,875
Fritzi. Of course.

77
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:19,796
Let me.

78
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,685
You have the number
at the ship.

79
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,562
Call me whenever you need me.

80
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,564
This is Glen,
the camp director.

81
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,691
- l know.
- Go to him if you have a problem.

82
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,401
That's enough, Mom.
You're embarrassing me.

83
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,069
We'll take very good care of him.

84
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,864
- Give me a hug.
- l can't breathe!

85
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,576
Jenna!

86
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,786
My role model
in everything Nubian.

87
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,288
What are you doing here?

88
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:56,583
l thought you had to go to
Weight Watchers Camp this summer.

89
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,792
We wanted her to,

90
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:01,296
but she insisted on
going back to Camp Ovation.

91
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,798
So we compromised
and had her jaw wired shut.

92
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,303
You can hardly tell.

93
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:14,976
l dim the lights
and think about you

94
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:20,190
Spend sleepless nights
and think about you

95
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,776
You said you loved me

96
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,779
Buddy Miller,
sports counselor.

97
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:29,699
- We have a sports counselor?
- Of course we do.

98
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,868
You gonna play some softball
this summer?

99
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,078
No.

100
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,596
Michael!

101
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:56,685
- How you doin', babe?
- Why weren't you on the bus?

102
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:59,104
My sister drove me here.
l'm staying with her.

103
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,272
My God, your face.

104
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:04,067
He tried to go to his junior prom
in fishnets and heels.

105
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,985
My junior prom,

106
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,780
l stayed home with
a roll of cookie dough and TV Land.

107
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,782
l watched my junior prom

108
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:13,785
from outside in the bushes
for three hours.

109
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,578
That's so Stella Dallas.

110
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:18,081
ls Bert Hanley
really directing here this summer?

111
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,500
l thought he retired.

112
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,003
- l thought he died.
- He might have.

113
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,963
 He was supposed to
be here two days ago.

114
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,382
How does that happen?
He used to be huge.

115
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,676
He hasn't had a hit
since Childrehs Crusade.

116
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,094
He never wrote another show.

117
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,596
l hope he directs the benefit
this summer.

118
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,266
What are you singing
for auditions for the first show?

119
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:39,102
- Doht Raih oh My Parade.
- That's original.

120
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,981
With the tugboat.

121
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,278
What is that supposed to be?

122
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,288
How you doing?

123
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,875
My name's Vlad.

124
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,885
Okay if l use those drawers?

125
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,095
You can go into
anybody's drawers you like.

126
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:17,098
l don't think
you'll get an argument.

127
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,603
Just ignore him.
That's what he's used to.

128
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,397
l'm Ellen, this is Shaun

129
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:27,776
and Spitzer and Michael.

130
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:40,288
Bathroom?

131
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:49,673
Thirty-foot rule.

132
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:50,965
- No way!
- What's that?

133
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:54,594
Michael has to stay 30 feet away
until we know if he's straight or gay.

134
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,471
lf he's gay, l'm Tyne Daly.

135
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,675
Could someone please shut her up?

136
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,895
Next.

137
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:24,684
Childhood living

138
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:30,482
ls easy to do

139
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:38,073
The things you wanted

140
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:44,204
l bought them for you

141
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:50,877
Graceless lady

142
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:56,883
You know who l am

143
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:04,099
You know l can't let you

144
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,896
Slide through my hands

145
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,903
Wild horses

146
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:23,702
Couldn't drag me away

147
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:30,375
Wild, wild horses

148
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,505
Couldn't drag me away

149
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:50,770
A boy.
An honest-to-God straight boy.

150
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,277
Cast lists are up.

151
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,906
l will go insane if l don't get
into Promises. Promises.

152
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,285
l'm in it!

153
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,166
Midhight Suh?

154
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:26,681
Old.

155
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:37,192
Old.

156
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:44,074
Lost.

157
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:49,704
Lost.

158
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:55,293
Two thousand sunsets,
yet not one sunrise.

159
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:58,880
No, no, no, no!
God damn you all!

160
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,966
You piss on the memory
of the greatest playwright

161
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:04,094
of the 20th century.

162
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:07,389
ln Cuba we took our lives
in our hands performing her work,

163
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:10,767
waiting for Castro's thugs
to burst in and arrest us!

164
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,602
l don't understand
what l'm saying.

165
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:15,480
Of course you don't,
you middle-class piece of shit!

166
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:18,775
- l'm doing the best l can.
- That's what's so tragic.

167
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,485
Leave her alone.

168
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:27,367
How about you, then?

169
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,994
Have you had even
one painful moment in your life

170
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:33,206
since the doctor slapped you
on your ass when you were born?

171
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,669
- Yeah.
- Tell me, then.

172
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,671
Tell me
your most painful moment,

173
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,799
the one that makes you convulse
with sobs when you think of it.

174
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,385
Why would l do that
in front of three strangers?

175
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:48,471
To be able to do it
in front of 3,000.

176
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,268
Back to the top, and try not to
screw up the blocking this time.

177
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:56,604
Eyes, eyes, nostrils,
silent scream.

178
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,069
l have to go to the bathroom.

179
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,405
Piss in the Dumpster.
Start again!

180
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,482
How was your first day
of rehearsal?

181
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:43,276
lt was okay.

182
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:48,490
l'm a little out of my element.

183
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,788
We really do a new show
every two weeks?

184
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:57,374
And a benefit
at the end of the summer.

185
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:59,876
Jeez!

186
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:05,674
Ellen said you were her hero today
with that crazy director.

187
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,678
Can l ask you
something personal?

188
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,972
What made you come here?

189
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:16,476
l want to act. Why?

190
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,689
We just don't get many like you.

191
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,694
Can l ask you something personal?

192
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:26,903
Yeah.

193
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,197
You're gay, right?

194
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,492
How do you know?

195
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:37,580
Have you ever experimented
with heterosexuality?

196
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:42,377
You mean sleep with a straight guy?
What for?

197
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:47,799
- A girl.
- l can't even straighten my hair.

198
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:51,803
That's too bad.
You'd be a total playa.

199
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,391
Got that whole Latin thing going.

200
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,896
Get a girl alone,
throw on some salsa,

201
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,108
whisper a little Spanish in her ear.

202
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:10,488
- You'd make out like a bandit.
- l'll keep that in mind.

203
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:17,370
ls that your father?

204
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:20,874
That's Stephen Sondheim.

205
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:27,005
The greatest songwriter
in musical theater.

206
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,303
l don't talk to my parents.

207
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:36,473
- Why not?
- Enough.

208
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:38,391
l have to keep
some kind of mystery.

209
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:41,895
You'll grow bored with me
and move on to someone younger.

210
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:46,107
- Good night, Mike.
- 'Night, Vlad.

211
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,908
Did he call me Mike?

212
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:29,901
Can l help you?

213
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:33,905
l'm not sure
where l'm supposed to go.

214
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:37,409
- l'm Bert Hanley.
- lt's about time.

215
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:38,785
Where have you been?

216
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:41,204
You were supposed to
be here two days ago.

217
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:45,792
You're right.
What's the use in lying?

218
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:50,171
- l've been drinking for 72 hours.
- You've been drinking?

219
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:53,508
Not the way you make it sound
when you say, ''Drinking?!''

220
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:56,469
l'm fine now, really.

221
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:00,974
Let's get started.
l'll get those.

222
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:08,606
l assumed that we would have
some adult time to ourselves.

223
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,570
What show am l doing, anyway?

224
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:25,206
Good times and bum times,
l've seen them all

225
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:29,878
And, my dear,
l'm still here

226
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:35,383
Plush velvet sometimes,
sometimes just pretzels and beer

227
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:38,178
But l'm here

228
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:41,473
l've run the gamut ''A'' to ''Z''

229
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:46,186
Three cheers and damn it,
cest la vie

230
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:49,189
l got through all of last year

231
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:53,276
And l'm here

232
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:56,488
Lord knows,
at least l was there

233
00:19:56,571 --> 00:20:00,992
And l'm here

234
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:05,080
Look who's here

235
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,501
l'm still here

236
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:04,681
- Hi.
- Hi.

237
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:13,398
My name's Vlad.

238
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,278
l don't mean
to bother you or anything.

239
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:22,490
l just wanted to tell you
how excited l am that you're here.

240
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:28,288
l did a production
of The Childrehs Crusade

241
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:29,873
at school this spring.

242
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:38,173
At first l did it
just to get close to this girl.

243
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:39,883
But then it was so good.

244
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:43,970
lt really took the characters
of the kids so seriously.

245
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:47,098
That's really kind of you to say.

246
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:50,101
That song  Sihg for You.

247
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:52,395
l listened to the record,
like, a hundred times

248
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:54,773
just to get the chords right
on my guitar.

249
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:59,402
lt's not out on CD.
Did you know that?

250
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:01,696
Yeah, l knew that.

251
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:06,785
So, what shows have you done
since then, Mr. Hanley?

252
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:10,789
Thank you very much
for coming by to visit, Vlad.

253
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:14,292
Thank you.
Just give me a break.

254
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,378
You little ass-kisser.

255
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,088
One, two, three, four.

256
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:24,678
Quit dragging!

257
00:22:24,803 --> 00:22:27,597
Y'all better get your asses
used to less sleep

258
00:22:27,597 --> 00:22:30,892
'cause we're gonna have
rehearsal all morning.

259
00:22:30,892 --> 00:22:34,979
Then lunch,
then rehearsal.

260
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:38,108
Then dinner,
then rehearsal.

261
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:42,404
And the whole thing
starts all over again the next day.

262
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:44,906
Miss Allen, we've all seen
the beginning of Fame.

263
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:49,077
Fame. huh?

264
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:02,590
- They do that on Fame?
- No.

265
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:07,387
Again!
One, two, three, four.

266
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:13,101
'Night, Jenna.

267
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:17,772
Shut up! Start again!

268
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:21,109
Eyes, eyes, nostrils!
Silent scream!

269
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:31,077
You're really talented.

270
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:36,207
l don't understand
a single word of this crap,

271
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:38,877
but you do it
with such conviction.

272
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:55,310
A guy like you could have a really
lucky summer in a place like this.

273
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:03,276
l'm starting to get that idea.

274
00:24:04,986 --> 00:24:08,698
Look. First star.
l know my wish.

275
00:24:11,993 --> 00:24:13,703
Changing the subject.

276
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:17,290
Do you have
any brothers or sisters?

277
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:22,087
Four brothers--
two older, two younger.

278
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:27,008
Must be tough when
the middle child is the special one.

279
00:24:27,092 --> 00:24:30,679
- Throws everything out of whack.
- Special? Yeah.

280
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:33,098
l don't even remember
the last time

281
00:24:33,181 --> 00:24:35,600
my parents called me
by the right name.

282
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:42,774
- You don't think you're special?
- No.

283
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:46,194
Seriously.

284
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:51,074
l don't mean like
dorky boy-band kind of special,

285
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:54,703
which l'm sure
you get all the time, but...

286
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:56,788
There's something really there.

287
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:00,291
Something substantial.

288
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:05,505
And you deserve
something substantial in return.

289
00:25:12,012 --> 00:25:14,097
Somebody hit me with a rock
so l shut up.

290
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:18,810
No. Made me feel great.

291
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:31,072
lt's cold.

292
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:33,992
Come here.

293
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,786
That worked.

294
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:43,376
ts 1 0 a.m.
Everybody should be ih class.

295
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:35,280
Here we are.

296
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:38,783
Jeez.

297
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:40,702
Be it ever so humble...

298
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:44,414
What's up, Fritzi?

299
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:48,376
Would you like Fritzi
to fix you a bug juice or something?

300
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:53,882
No.

301
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:01,306
Leave us.

302
00:28:06,186 --> 00:28:07,687
Bye, Fritzi.

303
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:17,405
Does she work for you now?

304
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:19,908
She likes to do little things for me.

305
00:28:19,991 --> 00:28:22,202
lt makes her feel like she belongs.

306
00:28:22,285 --> 00:28:25,413
l'm supposed to be
running lines with Ellen.

307
00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:27,582
She'll have the whole summer to do

308
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:31,878
that brother-sister bonding thing
she does with all the boys.

309
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,078
Sit.

310
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:19,300
You said you had
a fantastic surprise for me.

311
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:21,594
What is it?

312
00:29:22,887 --> 00:29:24,305
Surprise.

313
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:33,398
l'm going to ask
if l can dance with Stella Jolla

314
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:35,275
in the ''Turkey Lurkey'' number.

315
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,610
l've been practicing really hard.

316
00:29:38,403 --> 00:29:40,405
That's the part Jill wants to play.

317
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:42,907
''Turkey Lurkey''
is the best number in the show.

318
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:46,703
l know.
l took dance classes all winter.

319
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:49,789
Good for you.

320
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:55,003
The only thing is, it's a '60s show.
That means tight little miniskirts.

321
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:57,088
l'm just trying to be a friend.

322
00:29:57,213 --> 00:30:00,091
What are you saying,
that everyone would see my legs?

323
00:30:00,175 --> 00:30:03,511
Not that they're so bad.
They're just a little chunky.

324
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:05,805
But the halter tops.

325
00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:09,309
l'd worry about my rolls
jiggling around in the spotlight.

326
00:30:09,392 --> 00:30:12,395
Whereas the secretary character
has some great one-liners

327
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:14,606
and wears sensible suits.

328
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:22,906
We just love it here.

329
00:30:23,198 --> 00:30:25,283
We see a show every summer.

330
00:30:25,283 --> 00:30:27,285
What did we
see the kids do last year?

331
00:30:28,703 --> 00:30:29,913
Wit.

332
00:30:29,996 --> 00:30:31,289
Wit. right.

333
00:30:31,414 --> 00:30:33,708
Dark, but really entertaining.

334
00:30:41,508 --> 00:30:43,176
lt's turkey lurkey time

335
00:30:43,176 --> 00:30:46,888
Tom Turkey ran away,
but he just came home

336
00:30:46,888 --> 00:30:48,682
lt's turkey lurkey time

337
00:30:48,682 --> 00:30:52,185
He's really home to stay,
never one to roam

338
00:30:52,185 --> 00:30:56,898
Let's make a wish,
and may all our wishes come true

339
00:30:59,401 --> 00:31:03,405
A snowy, blowy Christmas,
a mistletoey Christmas

340
00:31:03,488 --> 00:31:07,784
A turkey lurkey Christmas to you

341
00:31:07,992 --> 00:31:11,079
A turkey lurkey Christmas to you

342
00:31:13,998 --> 00:31:15,792
lt's Loosey Goosey time

343
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:19,295
She was a gadabout,
but she's back again

344
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:21,089
lt's Loosey Goosey time

345
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:24,509
Her time is running out,
and we all know when

346
00:31:24,592 --> 00:31:29,389
Let's make a wish,
and may all our wishes come true

347
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:35,895
A snowy, blowy Christmas,
a mistletoey Christmas

348
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:39,607
A Loosey Goosey Christmas to you

349
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:42,902
A Loosey Goosey Christmas to you

350
00:31:46,197 --> 00:31:50,410
Turkey lurkey,
Loosey Goosey

351
00:31:50,493 --> 00:31:54,706
Some for Uncle Joe,
some for Cousin Lucy

352
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:56,291
Everybody gather round the table

353
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,710
Dig in, dinner's being served

354
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,712
Eat all the turkey
you are able

355
00:32:00,712 --> 00:32:02,505
Can't you see a partridge
in a pear tree?

356
00:32:02,589 --> 00:32:06,885
Climb up
and bring it down for me

357
00:32:06,885 --> 00:32:10,305
That's something l would like to see

358
00:32:55,016 --> 00:32:59,312
A snowy, blowy Christmas,
a mistletoey Christmas

359
00:32:59,396 --> 00:33:03,483
A turkey lurkey Christmas to you

360
00:33:09,698 --> 00:33:12,117
Jingle bells, jingle bells

361
00:33:16,913 --> 00:33:20,583
l'm still here

362
00:33:20,709 --> 00:33:22,085
Jingle bells, jingle bells

363
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,295
l'm still here

364
00:33:24,379 --> 00:33:26,506
Jingle bells, jingle bells

365
00:33:51,406 --> 00:33:53,116
Sadness.

366
00:33:57,287 --> 00:34:00,915
Vlad, your cat's dead.
l'm sorry.

367
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:05,086
He was hit by a car
this afternoon.

368
00:34:06,212 --> 00:34:09,716
Vlad, your mom's dead.
l'm sorry.

369
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:12,802
She got nailed
by a car this afternoon.

370
00:34:20,977 --> 00:34:22,479
Sorry.

371
00:34:22,479 --> 00:34:24,481
l like to practice in the mirror.

372
00:34:31,905 --> 00:34:33,698
Your parents coming
to your show?

373
00:34:35,617 --> 00:34:37,494
Jesus, you still haven't called 'em?

374
00:34:37,494 --> 00:34:39,579
What are you going to do
when you have to go home?

375
00:34:39,704 --> 00:34:40,997
l'm not going home.

376
00:34:41,081 --> 00:34:44,084
- Where you going to live?
- l'll find an apartment.

377
00:34:44,084 --> 00:34:47,879
- You'll end up on a milk carton.
- They haven't called me, either.

378
00:34:48,004 --> 00:34:51,716
How much you wanna bet
they don't call me on my birthday?

379
00:34:51,716 --> 00:34:53,510
Then you have to be
bigger than them.

380
00:34:56,805 --> 00:34:59,599
How often are you going
to get cast as Romeo?

381
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:02,811
l mean it. Call 'em.

382
00:35:02,894 --> 00:35:06,189
Besides, who can resist you
in them tights?

383
00:35:06,314 --> 00:35:10,193
- Are you blushing?
- You kidding?

384
00:35:10,318 --> 00:35:12,779
l'm doing everything
but bat my eyes.

385
00:35:13,697 --> 00:35:14,906
Call 'em.

386
00:35:28,086 --> 00:35:29,879
Buddy Miller,
sports counselor.

387
00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:32,716
Remember me?
Think fast.

388
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:44,894
''Dear Mr. Flores,
the school has determined that

389
00:35:44,894 --> 00:35:47,814
''due to your refusal
to wear either a tuxedo

390
00:35:47,897 --> 00:35:51,317
''or an ankle-length formal gown,
you failed to meet the dress code,

391
00:35:51,317 --> 00:35:53,695
''and therefore
appropriate action was taken

392
00:35:53,695 --> 00:35:56,281
in refusing you entrance
to this year's junior prom.''

393
00:35:56,406 --> 00:35:58,783
You didn't get in
because of your hemline?

394
00:36:00,785 --> 00:36:03,204
l've been looking all over for you.

395
00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:16,718
- What are you drinking?
- Chicken breast.

396
00:36:16,801 --> 00:36:18,678
Don't you think
that's a little extreme?

397
00:36:18,678 --> 00:36:21,014
lt's her parents' idea, the pricks.

398
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:26,102
- lt's like some Nazi experiment.
- They're just looking out for me.

399
00:36:26,186 --> 00:36:28,104
You're only a few pounds
heavier than Ellen.

400
00:36:31,191 --> 00:36:34,319
Tell me something--
isn't it a pain in the ass

401
00:36:34,402 --> 00:36:37,405
to put on
all that makeup every day?

402
00:36:37,489 --> 00:36:40,408
l don't mind the extra effort so people
have something nice to look at.

403
00:36:40,492 --> 00:36:42,619
- l think she looks wonderful.
- We know!

404
00:36:42,702 --> 00:36:44,788
Looking good to attract
the opposite sex

405
00:36:44,913 --> 00:36:48,083
has been a basic human impulse
for almost a thousand years.

406
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:51,503
- What about before that?
- However old the world is.

407
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:56,508
lf you'd soften up a little,
you'd land yourself a boyfriend

408
00:36:56,591 --> 00:36:59,511
and lose that hostile edge
that's so unattractive.

409
00:36:59,511 --> 00:37:01,680
- Drop dead.
- That's the one.

410
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,517
l'd be happy to help.
You could be my project.

411
00:37:05,517 --> 00:37:07,602
l'll put you on a diet.
l'll style your hair.

412
00:37:07,686 --> 00:37:09,104
Enough.

413
00:37:09,187 --> 00:37:10,605
l heard about
your little line-learning session.

414
00:37:10,689 --> 00:37:12,899
You got Vlad to put
his arm around you.

415
00:37:12,982 --> 00:37:16,319
That must be like
third base for someone

416
00:37:16,403 --> 00:37:18,905
who's never been touched
by a boy, isn't it?

417
00:37:25,787 --> 00:37:26,996
Ellen, wait.

418
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,792
Where do you think
you're going?

419
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:36,589
You know, l think l know
your sister Cinderella.

420
00:37:51,312 --> 00:37:52,480
There you are.

421
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:56,609
You disappeared so fast.
l looked everywhere for you.

422
00:37:56,693 --> 00:37:58,987
Where's your girlfriend?

423
00:38:00,113 --> 00:38:01,906
She's not my girlfriend.

424
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:06,494
Why'd you come after me?

425
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,415
l don't know.

426
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:13,418
'Cause you were upset.

427
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:17,714
- She's a bitch.
- So was l.

428
00:38:18,715 --> 00:38:20,008
No.

429
00:38:28,183 --> 00:38:29,684
l like you, Ellen.

430
00:38:46,409 --> 00:38:48,119
l like you, too.

431
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:03,009
What is it that
we're listening to, anyway?

432
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:05,011
Nothing.

433
00:39:06,596 --> 00:39:08,181
l can't deal with this anymore.

434
00:39:08,306 --> 00:39:11,893
What?
l like regular music, too.

435
00:39:12,018 --> 00:39:16,106
l like Joni Mitchell.
l know every album by heart.

436
00:39:16,189 --> 00:39:18,608
They have this great
new thing called drums.

437
00:39:18,608 --> 00:39:20,402
You're gonna love it.

438
00:39:35,417 --> 00:39:37,502
What's so special about this?

439
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,089
Sometimes it's nice
not to be special.

440
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:44,217
Sometimes it's nice to listen
to what everyone else listens to

441
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,719
just to be normal for once.

442
00:39:47,595 --> 00:39:50,682
- Dance with me.
- Jump off the roof.

443
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,393
Come on, dance with me.

444
00:40:02,819 --> 00:40:03,820
Asshole!

445
00:40:04,904 --> 00:40:05,989
Just kidding.

446
00:40:06,197 --> 00:40:07,615
Just kidding.

447
00:40:38,396 --> 00:40:40,398
Fiddler oh the Roof?

448
00:40:40,398 --> 00:40:43,109
This is the last straw.
Look at us.

449
00:40:43,193 --> 00:40:45,320
Do we look like
any Jews you know?

450
00:40:45,403 --> 00:40:47,697
You could be Sephardic.

451
00:40:47,781 --> 00:40:50,408
Look at those curly things
on Petie.

452
00:40:51,701 --> 00:40:54,996
l don't think Motel the tailor
used a lot of hair relaxer.

453
00:40:55,121 --> 00:40:57,707
lt's color-blind casting.
What do you want me to do?

454
00:40:57,791 --> 00:41:00,210
Porgy ahd Bess?
Brihg ih Da Noise?

455
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:02,212
Why do we have to
play white characters

456
00:41:02,212 --> 00:41:04,214
show after show,
summer after summer?

457
00:41:04,297 --> 00:41:06,591
l don't have enough black kids
to do an all-black show.

458
00:41:06,716 --> 00:41:08,385
l want my little brother learning

459
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:10,595
he can be himself
and still get applause.

460
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:15,183
You know what l'm saying?
What are you gonna do about it?

461
00:41:19,688 --> 00:41:22,982
And l am telling you

462
00:41:23,108 --> 00:41:26,319
l'm not going

463
00:41:27,487 --> 00:41:30,907
You're the best man
l'll ever know

464
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:34,494
There's no way
l can ever go

465
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:36,996
No, no, no, no way

466
00:41:36,996 --> 00:41:42,210
No, no, no, no way
l'm living without you

467
00:41:42,293 --> 00:41:44,295
l'm not living without you

468
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:49,801
l don't wanna be free

469
00:41:49,884 --> 00:41:51,511
l'm staying

470
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,805
l'm staying

471
00:41:53,888 --> 00:41:55,515
And you, and you

472
00:41:56,891 --> 00:42:01,604
You're gonna love me

473
00:42:04,107 --> 00:42:06,693
You're gonna love me

474
00:42:11,489 --> 00:42:15,410
And l am telling you

475
00:42:15,493 --> 00:42:17,620
l'm not going

476
00:42:18,621 --> 00:42:21,916
Even though
the rough times are showing

477
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:25,086
There's just no way

478
00:42:25,211 --> 00:42:27,505
No way

479
00:42:31,301 --> 00:42:32,594
Skateboarding?

480
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,805
For someone with
a name like Vladimir,

481
00:42:35,805 --> 00:42:38,391
you sure are
a clichéd American teenager.

482
00:42:38,391 --> 00:42:41,603
lf you don't like it,
stop watching.

483
00:42:41,686 --> 00:42:44,981
l'm not. l'm reading.

484
00:43:02,415 --> 00:43:05,585
Sorry. l'm only human.

485
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:07,796
Call your parents, Romeo.

486
00:43:09,297 --> 00:43:11,007
Get 'em up here.

487
00:43:17,305 --> 00:43:24,896
And l am telling you

488
00:43:25,021 --> 00:43:28,108
l'm not going

489
00:43:29,317 --> 00:43:31,111
l'm staying

490
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:33,113
l'm staying

491
00:43:33,196 --> 00:43:36,116
And you, and you, and you

492
00:43:36,199 --> 00:43:40,620
You're gonna love me

493
00:43:43,206 --> 00:43:46,918
You're gonna love me

494
00:43:47,002 --> 00:43:48,712
Yes

495
00:43:48,795 --> 00:43:50,005
Love me

496
00:43:51,214 --> 00:43:59,806
You're gonna love me

497
00:44:36,009 --> 00:44:37,385
l envy you.

498
00:44:40,305 --> 00:44:44,100
You've probably known what you
wanted to do since you were born.

499
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:52,609
When l was eight years old,

500
00:44:52,609 --> 00:44:55,612
l asked my father
to send me to acting class.

501
00:44:55,695 --> 00:44:57,322
And you know what he said?

502
00:44:58,615 --> 00:45:01,409
''There are five billion people
in this world.

503
00:45:02,494 --> 00:45:05,914
''lf only one-tenth of one percent
of them want to be actors,

504
00:45:05,914 --> 00:45:08,083
''that's still five million people.

505
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:13,505
''Do you really think you're prettier
than five million people?

506
00:45:15,799 --> 00:45:18,385
You're not even
the prettiest one in your class.''

507
00:45:26,017 --> 00:45:28,019
l think you're very pretty.

508
00:45:39,906 --> 00:45:41,908
Why should that make me
want to cry?

509
00:45:50,417 --> 00:45:52,419
l would've asked you
to your prom.

510
00:46:26,202 --> 00:46:27,287
Mom.

511
00:46:30,999 --> 00:46:32,792
l'm sorry,
did l wake you up?

512
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,719
lt's nice to hear your voice, too.

513
00:46:47,724 --> 00:46:49,017
l miss you too, Mom.

514
00:46:58,109 --> 00:47:00,111
Can you guys
come see my show?

515
00:47:02,697 --> 00:47:04,115
Great.

516
00:47:12,415 --> 00:47:14,084
New cast lists are up.

517
00:47:14,084 --> 00:47:17,003
l got Joanne in Compahy.
You're in it, too.

518
00:47:22,384 --> 00:47:24,010
What are you doing?

519
00:47:25,595 --> 00:47:26,721
Nothing.

520
00:47:27,514 --> 00:47:29,224
What is that?

521
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:36,523
- ls that my underwear?
- l was just washing them out.

522
00:47:37,607 --> 00:47:39,484
We need to talk.

523
00:47:42,612 --> 00:47:45,115
l think we need
a little break from each other.

524
00:47:45,115 --> 00:47:46,991
What?

525
00:47:47,117 --> 00:47:50,286
lt's something l've been meaning
to bring up for a while now.

526
00:47:50,412 --> 00:47:54,290
This whole thing
is beginning to get a little weird.

527
00:47:54,416 --> 00:47:57,002
l don't understand. l've done
everything you've asked me to.

528
00:47:57,085 --> 00:47:59,295
l know, and it's been
a great help,

529
00:47:59,421 --> 00:48:03,425
but the time has come for you
to get some sort of life.

530
00:48:04,384 --> 00:48:07,512
- l have a life.
- Get another one.

531
00:48:07,595 --> 00:48:09,389
l don't know why you're saying this.

532
00:48:09,514 --> 00:48:11,307
- l can be better.
- You're not hearing me.

533
00:48:11,391 --> 00:48:13,393
Test me.
l'll do anything you say.

534
00:48:13,518 --> 00:48:16,312
- You're my best friend!
- Get away from me, you freak!

535
00:48:19,816 --> 00:48:21,401
From now on,

536
00:48:21,401 --> 00:48:24,612
let's just go about our business
and pretend like we never met.

537
00:48:24,696 --> 00:48:26,197
Okay?

538
00:48:26,197 --> 00:48:27,615
l'm going out.

539
00:48:27,615 --> 00:48:30,118
Why don't you be gone
when l get back.

540
00:48:44,215 --> 00:48:46,509
You ready
for our big opening night?

541
00:48:50,013 --> 00:48:52,807
You're very intense
back there in the chorus.

542
00:48:52,891 --> 00:48:54,684
ls everything okay?

543
00:48:56,019 --> 00:48:57,687
l'm a little frustrated.

544
00:48:59,397 --> 00:49:02,108
Frustration's a useless emotion.

545
00:49:02,192 --> 00:49:05,320
lf you see something you want,
you just got to go for it.

546
00:49:05,403 --> 00:49:06,696
Easy to say.

547
00:49:08,323 --> 00:49:10,909
lt's better to regret
something you have done

548
00:49:10,992 --> 00:49:12,702
than something you haven't done.

549
00:49:12,786 --> 00:49:15,288
- Trust me, l'm the expert.
- Really?

550
00:49:16,998 --> 00:49:21,294
l've been watching you,
and you are a scary little girl.

551
00:49:22,212 --> 00:49:25,090
There's nothing you can't do
if you put your mind to it.

552
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:30,095
Thank you, Mr. Hanley.

553
00:49:31,221 --> 00:49:33,223
You've been very helpful.

554
00:49:40,397 --> 00:49:44,526
Luhch is how beihg seved.
Everybody should be at luhch.

555
00:50:22,188 --> 00:50:25,525
l'd like to propose a toast.

556
00:50:28,611 --> 00:50:32,490
Here's to the ladies who lunch

557
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:35,118
Everybody laugh

558
00:50:46,921 --> 00:50:48,715
Lounging in their caftans

559
00:50:48,715 --> 00:50:54,596
And planning a brunch
on their own behalf

560
00:51:04,689 --> 00:51:07,025
- l'm going to call it off.
- l think you'd better.

561
00:51:07,108 --> 00:51:08,318
Wait.

562
00:51:11,112 --> 00:51:12,989
What in the hell
are you doing here?

563
00:51:13,114 --> 00:51:15,408
l knew you'd be discussing
stopping the show,

564
00:51:15,492 --> 00:51:18,119
and l just thought how
disappointed the kids would be.

565
00:51:18,203 --> 00:51:22,290
- You scheming little bitch!
- Please! l'm a child.

566
00:51:22,415 --> 00:51:23,792
lf you think for one...

567
00:51:23,917 --> 00:51:25,293
Save the speech, rummy.

568
00:51:25,418 --> 00:51:27,295
She's fucked, l'm ready,

569
00:51:27,295 --> 00:51:29,506
and the goddamn show
must go on.

570
00:51:29,589 --> 00:51:32,217
So let's get cracking, shall we?

571
00:51:34,803 --> 00:51:36,388
l'll drink to that

572
00:51:39,724 --> 00:51:42,519
Here's to the girls
who just watch

573
00:51:42,602 --> 00:51:44,688
Aren't they the best?

574
00:51:46,398 --> 00:51:52,696
When they get depressed,
it's a bottle of scotch plus a little jest

575
00:51:55,615 --> 00:51:59,494
Another chance to disapprove

576
00:51:59,494 --> 00:52:03,498
Another brilliant zinger

577
00:52:03,623 --> 00:52:07,502
Another reason not to move

578
00:52:07,627 --> 00:52:10,588
Another vodka stinger

579
00:52:14,092 --> 00:52:16,219
l'll drink to that

580
00:52:19,014 --> 00:52:22,017
So here's to the girls on the go

581
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,310
Everybody tries

582
00:52:26,104 --> 00:52:29,816
Look into their eyes
and you'll see what they know

583
00:52:29,816 --> 00:52:34,487
Everybody dies

584
00:52:34,612 --> 00:52:37,490
A toast
to that invincible bunch

585
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,494
The dinosaurs
surviving the crunch

586
00:52:42,704 --> 00:52:45,498
Let's hear it
for the ladies who lunch

587
00:52:45,623 --> 00:52:51,004
Everybody rise

588
00:52:51,087 --> 00:52:54,424
Rise

589
00:53:18,823 --> 00:53:22,911
Two households,
both alike in dignity

590
00:53:22,911 --> 00:53:26,414
in fair Verona,
where we lay our scene.

591
00:53:26,498 --> 00:53:30,126
From ancient grudge
break to new mutiny,

592
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:34,214
where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.

593
00:53:43,306 --> 00:53:46,518
Romeo, come forth.

594
00:53:46,601 --> 00:53:49,104
Come forth,
thou fearful man.

595
00:53:49,187 --> 00:53:52,023
Affliction is enamored
of thy parts

596
00:53:52,107 --> 00:53:55,193
and thou art wedded
to calamity.

597
00:53:56,403 --> 00:53:59,197
Father, 'tis l, Romeo.

598
00:53:59,322 --> 00:54:01,991
What news?
What is the Prince's doom?

599
00:54:02,117 --> 00:54:04,494
What sorrow
craves acquaintance...

600
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:23,304
Tell me, Chino...

601
00:54:25,098 --> 00:54:28,018
...how many bullets
are left in this gun?

602
00:54:31,312 --> 00:54:35,525
Enough for you?
And you? And you?

603
00:54:35,608 --> 00:54:38,903
How many can l shoot
and still have one left for me?

604
00:55:12,729 --> 00:55:14,314
Michael, where are you?

605
00:55:29,412 --> 00:55:32,499
Dude, we looked
all over for you.

606
00:55:35,001 --> 00:55:36,711
l heard about what happened.

607
00:55:38,004 --> 00:55:40,090
l called them afterwards...

608
00:55:41,925 --> 00:55:44,094
...to make sure they
weren't dead somewhere

609
00:55:44,094 --> 00:55:45,720
on the New York State Thruway.

610
00:55:50,892 --> 00:55:54,229
My father decided he couldn't
put himself through seeing me.

611
00:55:55,605 --> 00:55:57,190
What does that even mean?

612
00:55:58,525 --> 00:56:00,902
lt means they think l'm a freak,

613
00:56:00,902 --> 00:56:03,029
like the kids at my school.

614
00:56:06,116 --> 00:56:08,993
Let's face it, even here
l'm in the upper third.

615
00:56:13,623 --> 00:56:15,917
Why don't you live at home?

616
00:56:16,793 --> 00:56:18,503
Prom night,

617
00:56:18,503 --> 00:56:21,923
my father looked at me
bleeding in a dress.

618
00:56:23,216 --> 00:56:25,510
He told me
l brought it upon myself.

619
00:56:25,593 --> 00:56:28,304
He said that if l did that
when he were in school,

620
00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:31,391
he'd have been one of those boys
kicking my ass, too.

621
00:56:31,516 --> 00:56:33,018
That's crazy.

622
00:56:33,101 --> 00:56:35,395
When it was happening,

623
00:56:35,395 --> 00:56:41,109
l just projected myself out of it,

624
00:56:41,192 --> 00:56:43,528
and in my head
l went somewhere else.

625
00:56:45,321 --> 00:56:46,406
Where?

626
00:56:51,828 --> 00:56:53,121
Here.

627
00:56:59,627 --> 00:57:01,921
Why would you wear a dress
to your prom, dude?

628
00:57:03,006 --> 00:57:05,300
You had to know
you were going to get creamed.

629
00:57:05,425 --> 00:57:09,095
- l don't get that.
- Of course you don't get that.

630
00:57:10,805 --> 00:57:14,392
That's because your life
is pretty damn close to perfect.

631
00:57:15,518 --> 00:57:19,397
Mine is like, one from column ''A,''
one from column ''shit.''

632
00:57:21,316 --> 00:57:22,817
Perfect.

633
00:57:30,325 --> 00:57:31,910
How about this?

634
00:57:32,994 --> 00:57:36,206
3, 4, 6, 1 ,
3, 4, 6, 4, 10,

635
00:57:36,206 --> 00:57:39,417
4, 1 4, 3, 1 7, 1 , 1 8,

636
00:57:39,417 --> 00:57:42,712
6, 24, 4, 28, 3, 31 , 4.

637
00:57:43,713 --> 00:57:46,925
- What's that?
- Have you ever heard of OCD?

638
00:57:48,718 --> 00:57:50,804
l count letters involuntarily.

639
00:57:50,929 --> 00:57:54,015
That was ''one from column 'A,'
one from column 'shit.'''

640
00:57:54,099 --> 00:57:55,725
l don't understand.

641
00:57:55,809 --> 00:57:57,018
lt's like,

642
00:57:57,102 --> 00:58:01,606
lf l don't take my pill,
then every time someone speaks,

643
00:58:01,606 --> 00:58:08,029
or if l have an idea,
or if somebody talks--anything--

644
00:58:08,029 --> 00:58:11,408
l break it down into words,
then into letters,

645
00:58:11,491 --> 00:58:13,326
and l add them up.

646
00:58:14,703 --> 00:58:18,623
3, 1 , 3, 4, 2.
''And l add them up.''

647
00:58:19,791 --> 00:58:23,420
l take those numbers,
and l add them up backwards.

648
00:58:23,503 --> 00:58:27,924
3, 1 , 3, 4, 2
was 6, 3, 9, 1 , 10, 3, 1 3, 4.

649
00:58:28,008 --> 00:58:29,926
The last word,
plus the word before that,

650
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:32,512
plus the word before that,
and on and on...

651
00:58:34,222 --> 00:58:36,307
...till it ends in a prime number.

652
00:58:36,391 --> 00:58:39,602
lt's, like, constantly in my head.

653
00:58:40,603 --> 00:58:42,022
l take it all back.

654
00:58:42,897 --> 00:58:44,899
That's the sickest thing
l ever heard.

655
00:58:46,609 --> 00:58:47,902
l know.

656
00:58:49,195 --> 00:58:51,322
lt's weird 'cause it's,
like, it's just there.

657
00:58:53,616 --> 00:58:57,120
3, 4, 5, 9, 3, 1 2, 3.
''lt's just there.''

658
00:59:03,209 --> 00:59:06,212
lt's crazy. Oh, my God.

659
00:59:15,597 --> 00:59:18,892
That's why l act.
That's why l want to be an actor.

660
00:59:20,393 --> 00:59:26,399
'Cause when l'm acting,
it's not there if it's really going good.

661
00:59:26,524 --> 00:59:29,110
lt's like the character
doesn't have it...

662
00:59:31,529 --> 00:59:33,615
...so l don't have it.

663
00:59:51,591 --> 00:59:53,802
A teenage Prozac junkie.

664
00:59:57,305 --> 00:59:58,807
That's my perfect life.

665
01:00:09,192 --> 01:00:11,111
l guess we're both freaks.

666
01:00:16,408 --> 01:00:18,910
You can take a pill for yours.

667
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:25,417
l'm still some
teenage drag queen with bad skin

668
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:29,629
who can't put on a dress without
getting the crap beat out of him.

669
01:00:36,219 --> 01:00:37,804
Let's get out of here, man.

670
01:00:50,608 --> 01:00:54,112
Good morhihg. campers.
Time to rise ahd shihe.

671
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:59,325
Todays wake-up sohg
is a special bithday dedicatioh

672
01:00:59,325 --> 01:01:01,619
to Michael Flores.

673
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:04,330
Happy bithday. Michael.

674
01:01:09,002 --> 01:01:11,796
Surprise!

675
01:01:13,715 --> 01:01:15,300
Happy birthday!

676
01:01:28,897 --> 01:01:30,398
Oh, my God, look at you!

677
01:01:39,616 --> 01:01:42,327
The only thing l have to say is,
the hair on my legs better grow back,

678
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:44,412
or else somebody's getting sued.

679
01:01:44,496 --> 01:01:48,208
- You did not!
- God shave the queen.

680
01:01:49,417 --> 01:01:53,296
Surprise!
Drag Kings ''R'' Us!

681
01:02:11,815 --> 01:02:13,233
Make a wish.

682
01:02:14,609 --> 01:02:17,612
Right at this moment,
l have everything l want.

683
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:20,115
So...

684
01:02:21,324 --> 01:02:23,493
l'll give this wish to you guys.

685
01:02:53,398 --> 01:02:56,109
l sing for you

686
01:02:57,402 --> 01:02:59,612
And only you

687
01:02:59,612 --> 01:03:04,409
Wherever l go, l find you

688
01:03:07,328 --> 01:03:11,708
You're in the sound
of every ''hello''

689
01:03:12,709 --> 01:03:15,712
ln everything l do

690
01:03:17,714 --> 01:03:21,426
You're the song
l was destined to know

691
01:03:22,427 --> 01:03:26,723
And l only sing for you

692
01:03:33,897 --> 01:03:37,317
You went away

693
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:40,111
l should have known

694
01:03:40,195 --> 01:03:44,824
You'd leave so many dreams
behind you

695
01:03:48,119 --> 01:03:52,123
Thought l'd be fine
just being alone

696
01:03:52,999 --> 01:03:56,503
l didn't have a clue

697
01:03:57,629 --> 01:04:02,133
But my heart
had a mind of its own

698
01:04:03,218 --> 01:04:08,014
And would only sing for you

699
01:04:14,229 --> 01:04:18,900
You're in the sound of rain

700
01:04:28,493 --> 01:04:29,828
Who are you people?

701
01:04:29,911 --> 01:04:32,914
What planet did you
beam down from?

702
01:04:35,917 --> 01:04:37,127
l'm serious.

703
01:04:39,212 --> 01:04:41,214
lf l can teach you one thing,

704
01:04:41,297 --> 01:04:43,633
which is supposed
to be my job here...

705
01:04:44,926 --> 01:04:47,721
...it'd be that
you should all go home.

706
01:04:49,097 --> 01:04:53,601
Michael Bennett's dead.
Bob Fosse is dead.

707
01:04:53,727 --> 01:04:57,814
Times Square
is a theme park now.

708
01:04:59,733 --> 01:05:01,526
l hate to be the Grinch,

709
01:05:01,609 --> 01:05:04,112
but it's not normal
what goes on up here.

710
01:05:04,904 --> 01:05:07,615
Somebody has got to warn you.

711
01:05:07,699 --> 01:05:11,119
Teenage faghags
become adult faghags.

712
01:05:12,829 --> 01:05:14,205
Straight boys are straight.

713
01:05:14,330 --> 01:05:18,126
You can't turn 'em
just because you need to be loved.

714
01:05:18,126 --> 01:05:20,211
The foundation
that's being laid here

715
01:05:20,211 --> 01:05:23,631
is not going to help you
in the real world.

716
01:05:23,715 --> 01:05:28,511
lt's going to lead to
waitressing jobs and bitterness

717
01:05:28,595 --> 01:05:33,308
and the obsessive,
pointless collecting

718
01:05:33,308 --> 01:05:37,520
of out-of-print
original cast albums.

719
01:05:49,032 --> 01:05:51,618
l don't know what your problem is,
and l don't really care.

720
01:05:51,618 --> 01:05:54,496
Maybe you're a son of a bitch
just 'cause you haven't written a show

721
01:05:54,621 --> 01:05:56,498
in, like, a million years.

722
01:05:56,623 --> 01:05:58,500
Or maybe you're
just a stupid drunk,

723
01:05:58,625 --> 01:06:00,627
but those kids,
they look up to you.

724
01:06:00,710 --> 01:06:03,213
And they don't deserve
to be treated like that.

725
01:06:03,213 --> 01:06:06,508
''They''? Did you think
l wasn't talking to you, too?

726
01:06:06,633 --> 01:06:08,134
Or did l forget to mention that

727
01:06:08,134 --> 01:06:11,513
you're a fraud who has to be
everybody's golden boy,

728
01:06:11,596 --> 01:06:13,306
or you'll just shrivel up?

729
01:06:13,431 --> 01:06:15,100
l've taken shots at drunks before.

730
01:06:15,225 --> 01:06:17,310
Don't think l have some
honor code about it.

731
01:06:17,394 --> 01:06:18,728
Bring it on.

732
01:06:20,605 --> 01:06:22,232
What is your problem?

733
01:06:22,315 --> 01:06:23,900
l don't have a problem.

734
01:06:25,527 --> 01:06:28,029
There's a theater in Brooklyn
that's got a problem.

735
01:06:28,113 --> 01:06:30,824
Seems they need
a rehearsal pianist,

736
01:06:30,824 --> 01:06:35,203
and they thought l might just be
hard up enough to oblige.

737
01:06:35,328 --> 01:06:38,832
So l sit in hot, stinking traffic
for three hours

738
01:06:38,832 --> 01:06:41,209
just to drive down there
to find out it's not

739
01:06:41,209 --> 01:06:44,921
the 200th revival
of my one hit show they wanted.

740
01:06:45,005 --> 01:06:49,009
You should never meet your heroes.
They always disappoint you.

741
01:06:49,134 --> 01:06:52,012
Come on, kid.
Come here. Help me out.

742
01:06:53,513 --> 01:06:54,931
l think l'm going to be sick.

743
01:06:59,519 --> 01:07:01,021
Oh, Jesus!

744
01:07:01,521 --> 01:07:02,897
God!

745
01:07:52,197 --> 01:07:53,698
Get it away.

746
01:07:54,699 --> 01:07:56,326
You don't even know what it is.

747
01:07:56,409 --> 01:07:59,621
l don't care. lf it's been
touched by him, it's diseased.

748
01:08:02,499 --> 01:08:04,417
- Oh, my God.
- Spit.

749
01:08:09,005 --> 01:08:11,716
lt's everything he's written
since The Childrehs Crusade.

750
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,927
There's a ton more at his place.

751
01:08:13,927 --> 01:08:17,013
lt's like the Holy Grail
of musical theater.

752
01:08:18,932 --> 01:08:20,809
This one doesn't look so good.

753
01:08:20,934 --> 01:08:23,728
Some are lousy,
but most of 'em are great.

754
01:08:25,021 --> 01:08:27,607
lt's like they don't even
seem like they're from shows.

755
01:08:27,732 --> 01:08:29,317
They're just songs he wrote.

756
01:08:30,402 --> 01:08:32,028
There's funk, gospel.

757
01:08:33,029 --> 01:08:36,616
There's this awesome,
rootsy Neil Young song.

758
01:08:39,119 --> 01:08:40,829
Come on. Neil Young?

759
01:08:44,499 --> 01:08:47,836
He doesn't know l took 'em.
They're just copies.

760
01:08:47,919 --> 01:08:49,629
What are you going
to do with them?

761
01:08:49,713 --> 01:08:52,507
What time's that benefit rehearsal
start tomorrow?

762
01:08:52,632 --> 01:08:54,134
1 2:00 to 3:00.

763
01:08:55,135 --> 01:08:56,302
That's it?

764
01:08:56,428 --> 01:08:59,431
Ever since Michael's drag party,
Glen's been on a crusade

765
01:08:59,514 --> 01:09:01,433
to make us
more like a normal camp,

766
01:09:01,516 --> 01:09:05,228
so he's cutting back the benefit
rehearsals to three hours a day.

767
01:09:05,311 --> 01:09:06,730
That's enough time.

768
01:09:07,522 --> 01:09:11,109
- Time for what?
- He'll be late. He's always late.

769
01:09:11,109 --> 01:09:12,110
For...?

770
01:09:13,236 --> 01:09:14,195
Come on.

771
01:09:36,009 --> 01:09:39,304
Outside my house
is a cactus plant

772
01:09:39,304 --> 01:09:42,307
They call the century tree

773
01:09:42,307 --> 01:09:45,310
Only once in a hundred years

774
01:09:45,310 --> 01:09:47,896
lt flowers gracefully

775
01:09:47,896 --> 01:09:52,901
And you never know
when it will bloom

776
01:09:54,235 --> 01:10:02,035
Hey, do you want
to come out and play the game?

777
01:10:02,118 --> 01:10:05,830
lt's never too late

778
01:10:06,998 --> 01:10:14,631
Hey, do you want
to come out and play the game?

779
01:10:14,714 --> 01:10:17,926
lt's never too late

780
01:10:20,303 --> 01:10:27,227
Clementine Hunter was 54
before she packed up her paint

781
01:10:32,315 --> 01:10:35,402
Old Uncle Taylor was 81

782
01:10:35,527 --> 01:10:40,407
When he rode his bike
across the plains of China

783
01:10:44,035 --> 01:10:48,832
And the sun
was shining on that day

784
01:10:48,915 --> 01:10:50,625
Just like today

785
01:10:50,709 --> 01:10:57,215
Do you want to come out
and play the game?

786
01:10:57,298 --> 01:11:01,511
lt's never too late

787
01:11:02,512 --> 01:11:09,811
Hey, do you want
to come out and play the game?

788
01:11:09,936 --> 01:11:14,399
lt's never too late

789
01:11:18,236 --> 01:11:23,908
Didn't know how to tell her
for over 30 years

790
01:11:24,034 --> 01:11:29,998
He kept locked up inside himself,
and no one saw the tears

791
01:11:30,123 --> 01:11:36,713
Then she went away,
and he woke up that day

792
01:11:36,838 --> 01:11:40,633
Now he brings roses
 to his sweetheart

793
01:11:40,633 --> 01:11:43,720
She lives most anywhere

794
01:11:43,803 --> 01:11:46,931
He sees someone suffering

795
01:11:47,015 --> 01:11:50,226
He knows that despair

796
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:56,024
He offers them a rose
and some quiet prose

797
01:11:56,107 --> 01:12:01,529
'Bout dancing
in a shimmering ballroom

798
01:12:01,613 --> 01:12:07,327
'Cause you never know
when they will bloom

799
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:16,002
Hey, do you want
to come out and play the game?

800
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:21,132
lt's never too late
to play the game

801
01:12:21,216 --> 01:12:28,515
Hey, do you want
to come out and play the game?

802
01:12:28,515 --> 01:12:30,433
lt's never too late

803
01:12:30,517 --> 01:12:33,228
Never too late to play the game

804
01:12:33,311 --> 01:12:39,401
Hey, do you want
to come out and play the game?

805
01:12:39,526 --> 01:12:42,737
And play the game,
it's never too late

806
01:12:42,821 --> 01:12:44,614
Never too late

807
01:12:45,407 --> 01:12:52,622
Hey, do you want
to come out and play the game?

808
01:12:52,706 --> 01:12:55,000
And play...

809
01:12:58,003 --> 01:13:05,218
Hey, do you want
to come out and play the game?

810
01:13:05,301 --> 01:13:07,929
lt's never too late

811
01:13:07,929 --> 01:13:10,598
lt's never too late,
never too late

812
01:13:10,724 --> 01:13:17,522
Hey, do you want
to come out and play the game?

813
01:13:17,522 --> 01:13:20,525
lt's never too late

814
01:13:20,734 --> 01:13:22,610
lt's never too late

815
01:13:22,736 --> 01:13:30,326
Hey, do you want
to come out and play the game?

816
01:13:30,410 --> 01:13:34,914
lt's never too late

817
01:13:34,998 --> 01:13:41,421
Hey, do you want
to come out and play the game?

818
01:13:41,504 --> 01:13:44,007
Wanna come out,
wanna come out

819
01:13:44,132 --> 01:13:47,010
lt's never too late

820
01:14:13,912 --> 01:14:16,706
l ever tell you we did
The Childrehs Crusade?

821
01:14:16,831 --> 01:14:20,627
Five summers ago.
lt was good.

822
01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:25,006
The kids want to do a revue
of my music for the benefit.

823
01:14:25,131 --> 01:14:27,801
l heard.
What did you tell them?

824
01:14:28,802 --> 01:14:32,138
- l told them yeah.
- Good. l'm glad.

825
01:14:32,222 --> 01:14:34,724
But not on
three hours' rehearsal a day.

826
01:14:34,808 --> 01:14:38,019
You tell me, am l wrong?
Am l doing such a horrible thing?

827
01:14:38,103 --> 01:14:40,730
l don't know.

828
01:14:40,730 --> 01:14:43,817
l was like you, except l was
feeling sorry for myself,

829
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:47,028
and l thought these kids
needed a hard dose of reality,

830
01:14:47,028 --> 01:14:49,406
so l gave it to them.
Both barrels.

831
01:14:51,116 --> 01:14:54,619
But l've been watching them,
and l was wrong.

832
01:14:55,912 --> 01:14:58,039
They're a bunch of little freaks.

833
01:14:59,124 --> 01:15:01,209
The more normal
we try to make them,

834
01:15:01,334 --> 01:15:04,504
the more lonely and isolated
they're gonna feel.

835
01:15:10,301 --> 01:15:12,721
Summer is almost over, Glen.

836
01:15:14,806 --> 01:15:17,308
Let's all go out like pros.
What do you say?

837
01:16:39,432 --> 01:16:41,601
Dee, ehtra.

838
01:16:45,522 --> 01:16:47,524
What are you doing here?

839
01:16:50,902 --> 01:16:52,612
Look, l don't speak no Spanish,

840
01:16:52,612 --> 01:16:54,531
so you better habla your ass
some English.

841
01:16:56,032 --> 01:16:59,327
Peter Piper picked a peck
of pickled peppers. Add that one.

842
01:17:00,036 --> 01:17:03,206
- Cut it out, dude.
- l'm gonna cure you.

843
01:17:03,331 --> 01:17:05,417
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

844
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:07,127
Why are you in a good mood?

845
01:17:07,127 --> 01:17:11,131
- You want to know?
- Yeah.

846
01:17:14,217 --> 01:17:15,427
What is that?

847
01:17:20,223 --> 01:17:21,433
No way.

848
01:17:24,436 --> 01:17:26,938
- Who?
- Dee.

849
01:17:27,939 --> 01:17:30,025
Dee? You slept with a girl?

850
01:17:31,818 --> 01:17:33,403
You slept with a girl?

851
01:17:33,528 --> 01:17:35,739
You're so full of shit.
l don't believe you.

852
01:17:35,822 --> 01:17:37,741
l mean, why would you?

853
01:17:37,824 --> 01:17:42,829
Maybe l didn't want a whole lifetime
of feeling the way l have so far.

854
01:17:46,541 --> 01:17:48,001
l'm asking Dee.

855
01:17:49,002 --> 01:17:51,504
- Don't.
- l'm calling your bluff.

856
01:17:51,629 --> 01:17:54,215
- Don't be a jerk.
- What're you gonna do?

857
01:18:10,607 --> 01:18:11,941
Ellen's not here.

858
01:18:11,941 --> 01:18:15,028
l know. What are you doing?

859
01:18:16,529 --> 01:18:17,822
A journal.

860
01:18:27,207 --> 01:18:29,709
Oh, my God!

861
01:18:32,921 --> 01:18:35,423
- Michael told me.
- That punk!

862
01:18:35,507 --> 01:18:37,801
l'm going to give him
a bitch slap so hard.

863
01:18:37,801 --> 01:18:42,305
- This is the trippiest thing l ever--
- All right.

864
01:18:42,305 --> 01:18:46,309
Could he do it, even?
Were his eyes open?

865
01:18:46,309 --> 01:18:47,936
Nothing against you, it's just...

866
01:18:48,019 --> 01:18:50,814
lf you wanna know, he talked
about you most of the time.

867
01:18:50,939 --> 01:18:52,315
During?

868
01:18:52,315 --> 01:18:54,818
Who knows?
l finally tuned him out.

869
01:18:57,112 --> 01:19:01,533
Come on.
Seriously, tell me.

870
01:19:02,534 --> 01:19:04,536
Why are you
so interested, anyway?

871
01:19:04,536 --> 01:19:08,331
- What's going on with you two?
- Nothing. Why?

872
01:19:08,415 --> 01:19:10,125
What did he say?

873
01:19:10,208 --> 01:19:13,920
l'm just saying you guys
hang out an awful lot.

874
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:16,506
So what? l'm straight.

875
01:19:18,341 --> 01:19:20,510
- Straight.
- All right.

876
01:19:21,803 --> 01:19:25,724
- You don't believe me?
- All l'm saying is that people talk.

877
01:19:37,736 --> 01:19:40,530
Sorry. That was stupid.

878
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:45,201
lt wasn't that stupid.
Do you know how long it's been

879
01:19:45,326 --> 01:19:47,704
since a guy's liked me
that wasn't gay?

880
01:19:48,413 --> 01:19:50,040
l don't like you.

881
01:19:50,832 --> 01:19:53,626
l mean, l like you,
but that's not why l did that.

882
01:19:56,421 --> 01:19:58,340
l don't know why l did that.

883
01:20:01,009 --> 01:20:02,427
lt's all right.

884
01:20:05,013 --> 01:20:06,222
Wait.

885
01:20:07,307 --> 01:20:08,933
You just slept with Michael.

886
01:20:09,017 --> 01:20:13,021
l'm sorry.
Then go back to your boyfriend.

887
01:20:13,104 --> 01:20:16,024
- Shut up.
- Why don't you make me?

888
01:20:33,416 --> 01:20:34,709
Shit!

889
01:20:40,423 --> 01:20:42,425
Come on, wait up!

890
01:20:43,718 --> 01:20:44,803
Leave me alone.

891
01:20:44,928 --> 01:20:47,722
- Wait up!
- Don't follow me!

892
01:21:12,122 --> 01:21:14,916
- Oh, baby!
- Doesn't she look pretty?

893
01:21:15,041 --> 01:21:17,502
- l missed you so much!
- You look so beautiful.

894
01:21:23,633 --> 01:21:26,428
l don't understand.
How can you spend all summer

895
01:21:26,511 --> 01:21:28,930
with your jaw wired shut
and still look like that?

896
01:21:29,014 --> 01:21:30,807
Fred!

897
01:21:31,641 --> 01:21:34,227
l'll tell you what,
we'll keep it on for fall term.

898
01:21:34,310 --> 01:21:37,230
You won't be sneaking milkshakes
with me around the house.

899
01:21:38,815 --> 01:21:40,525
l have to get ready.

900
01:21:41,443 --> 01:21:42,610
What?

901
01:22:22,609 --> 01:22:27,530
Oh, my God, it's him.
Stephen Sondheim.

902
01:23:35,515 --> 01:23:38,727
They called places already.
You're not even dressed yet?

903
01:23:49,237 --> 01:23:51,406
How paranoid can you be?

904
01:24:00,415 --> 01:24:01,708
Oh, my God.

905
01:24:03,043 --> 01:24:06,504
Was that your plan?
Did you put something in there?

906
01:24:06,629 --> 01:24:09,341
l only wish l'd thought of it.

907
01:24:13,136 --> 01:24:15,638
Can you please pass the base?

908
01:24:22,228 --> 01:24:24,439
- Thank you.
- This is ridiculous.

909
01:24:24,522 --> 01:24:25,940
lf you say one more syllable,

910
01:24:25,940 --> 01:24:28,318
l will shove a powder puff
down your windpipe...

911
01:24:28,443 --> 01:24:31,613
Do not underestimate my ass,
because l will knock you flat.

912
01:24:31,613 --> 01:24:33,323
- Girls, why don't we--
- Butt out.

913
01:24:33,406 --> 01:24:35,617
And there's no such thing
as bisexuality, you know.

914
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:42,916
- Julie? What are you doing here?
- l took the bus.

915
01:24:51,424 --> 01:24:52,842
How are you?

916
01:24:52,842 --> 01:24:54,719
- l'm good. How about you?
- Good.

917
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:57,430
- l give up.
- You give up?

918
01:25:01,935 --> 01:25:05,021
Julie, this is Ellen,
Michael, and Dee.

919
01:25:06,106 --> 01:25:08,441
Listen, is there
somewhere private we can go?

920
01:25:08,525 --> 01:25:10,443
Right now? l have a show.

921
01:25:10,443 --> 01:25:12,904
- l'll see you after, okay?
- Great.

922
01:25:15,115 --> 01:25:16,324
- Bye.
- Bye.

923
01:25:40,306 --> 01:25:44,019
- What?
- l hardly know where to begin.

924
01:25:45,311 --> 01:25:47,522
Why didn't you tell us
you had a girlfriend?

925
01:25:47,522 --> 01:25:48,606
You didn't ask.

926
01:25:48,732 --> 01:25:50,316
You never asked me
if l had a boyfriend,

927
01:25:50,442 --> 01:25:52,819
but if l did,
l would've said something...

928
01:25:58,908 --> 01:26:01,619
Except you assumed
l wouldn't have a boyfriend.

929
01:26:04,914 --> 01:26:06,041
Right.

930
01:26:06,833 --> 01:26:10,545
No sense in asking a question
like that to someone like me, right?

931
01:26:10,628 --> 01:26:11,629
Stop it.

932
01:26:11,713 --> 01:26:15,133
And l was supposed to assume
that you did have a girlfriend.

933
01:26:15,842 --> 01:26:17,927
And of course that you screw around.

934
01:26:18,011 --> 01:26:20,013
That's not true.
l'm sorry about Dee.

935
01:26:20,138 --> 01:26:23,016
lt's just...
l have no excuse.

936
01:26:24,142 --> 01:26:25,643
lt's all my fault.

937
01:26:26,728 --> 01:26:29,314
Maybe you and l only went out

938
01:26:29,439 --> 01:26:32,609
because l thought
it would make you happy.

939
01:26:32,734 --> 01:26:34,110
l'm sorry.

940
01:26:34,235 --> 01:26:35,528
Right.

941
01:26:36,821 --> 01:26:40,116
l knew that.
l knew that all along.

942
01:26:41,534 --> 01:26:43,328
l guess l just didn't care.

943
01:26:44,329 --> 01:26:46,831
But tell me one thing.

944
01:26:48,917 --> 01:26:52,545
What was going to happen to us
when we got back home?

945
01:26:52,629 --> 01:26:54,130
Places!

946
01:27:27,414 --> 01:27:31,543
Jesus Christ!
Oh, God!

947
01:27:32,836 --> 01:27:36,214
You sabotaged my makeup!
You bitch!

948
01:27:36,339 --> 01:27:37,841
l did not. Sit down.

949
01:27:44,305 --> 01:27:46,016
- l can't do it.
- Come on, Jenna.

950
01:27:46,016 --> 01:27:47,809
Fritzi's got multiple fractures,

951
01:27:47,934 --> 01:27:51,021
and Jill's face looks like
40 miles of bad road.

952
01:27:51,146 --> 01:27:52,522
You've got to do it.

953
01:27:54,816 --> 01:27:56,443
l know you're scared.

954
01:27:58,528 --> 01:27:59,946
lt's not that.

955
01:28:01,114 --> 01:28:02,615
My parents are here.

956
01:28:04,325 --> 01:28:06,828
lt's about time
they met their daughter.

957
01:28:33,730 --> 01:28:38,735
Here in the dark
l stand before you

958
01:28:38,818 --> 01:28:45,033
You know this is my chance
to show you my heart

959
01:28:45,116 --> 01:28:47,619
This is the start

960
01:28:47,827 --> 01:28:52,540
This is the start

961
01:28:52,624 --> 01:28:55,543
l have so much to say

962
01:28:55,627 --> 01:29:02,634
And l'm hoping
that your arms are open

963
01:29:02,717 --> 01:29:06,721
Don't turn away,
l want you near me

964
01:29:06,721 --> 01:29:11,309
But you have to hear me

965
01:29:11,309 --> 01:29:16,815
Here's where l stand,
here's who l am

966
01:29:16,940 --> 01:29:22,737
Love me, but don't tell me
who l have to be

967
01:29:22,737 --> 01:29:29,744
Here's who l am,
l'm what you see

968
01:29:29,744 --> 01:29:35,041
You said l had to change,
and l was trying

969
01:29:35,125 --> 01:29:39,921
But my heart was lying

970
01:29:39,921 --> 01:29:44,217
l'm not a child any longer

971
01:29:44,342 --> 01:29:50,932
l am stronger

972
01:29:50,932 --> 01:29:56,646
Here's where l stand,
here's who l am

973
01:29:56,730 --> 01:29:59,524
Help me to move on

974
01:29:59,607 --> 01:30:02,444
But please don't tell me how

975
01:30:02,444 --> 01:30:10,410
l'm on my way,
l'm moving now

976
01:30:11,327 --> 01:30:15,540
ln this life we've come so far

977
01:30:15,623 --> 01:30:19,627
But we're only who we are

978
01:30:19,711 --> 01:30:24,841
With the courage of love
to show us the way

979
01:30:24,924 --> 01:30:34,142
We've got the power
to stand up and say

980
01:30:35,226 --> 01:30:43,526
Here's where l stand,
here's who l am

981
01:30:43,526 --> 01:30:46,529
Stand up and be counted

982
01:30:46,529 --> 01:30:49,532
l'm counting on you

983
01:30:49,532 --> 01:30:56,331
lf you're with me,
we'll make it through

984
01:30:56,414 --> 01:31:01,836
Here's where l stand,
here's who l am

985
01:31:01,836 --> 01:31:05,715
Love me, love me, love me

986
01:31:05,715 --> 01:31:08,009
And we'll make it through

987
01:31:08,134 --> 01:31:11,846
Here's where l stand

988
01:31:11,846 --> 01:31:17,310
Baby, baby, baby,
l'm counting on you

989
01:31:17,435 --> 01:31:21,147
Here's where l stand

990
01:31:21,147 --> 01:31:24,442
Love me, love me, love me

991
01:31:24,526 --> 01:31:30,949
And we'll make it through

992
01:31:31,032 --> 01:31:35,036
l'm counting

993
01:31:36,413 --> 01:31:40,542
Oh, l'm counting

994
01:31:40,542 --> 01:31:43,044
l'm counting

995
01:31:43,044 --> 01:31:46,131
l'm counting on

996
01:31:51,219 --> 01:31:56,141
You

997
01:31:56,224 --> 01:32:02,313
Here's where l stand,
here's who l am

998
01:32:02,313 --> 01:32:04,315
l'm counting on you

999
01:32:04,441 --> 01:32:06,443
l'm counting on you

1000
01:32:06,526 --> 01:32:12,240
Here's where l stand,
here's who l am

1001
01:32:12,323 --> 01:32:13,908
We'll make it through

1002
01:32:14,034 --> 01:32:19,039
Here's where l stand,
here's who l am

1003
01:32:19,122 --> 01:32:22,125
Here's who l am,
l'm counting on you

1004
01:32:22,208 --> 01:32:24,336
l'm counting on you

1005
01:32:24,419 --> 01:32:27,130
Here's where l stand

1006
01:32:27,213 --> 01:32:30,633
Here's who l am

1007
01:32:30,717 --> 01:32:32,927
We'll make it through

1008
01:32:33,011 --> 01:32:35,347
Here's where l stand

1009
01:32:35,430 --> 01:32:39,726
Here's who l am

1010
01:32:39,726 --> 01:32:41,519
l'm counting on you

1011
01:32:41,728 --> 01:32:43,938
l'm counting on you

1012
01:32:43,938 --> 01:32:46,441
Here's where l stand

1013
01:32:48,735 --> 01:32:51,321
We'll make it through

1014
01:32:51,321 --> 01:32:57,410
Here's where l stand,
here's who l am

1015
01:32:57,535 --> 01:33:00,538
l'm counting on you

1016
01:33:00,622 --> 01:33:07,420
Here's where l stand,
here's who l am

1017
01:33:25,814 --> 01:33:29,025
Good job, Bert.
Really terrific.

1018
01:33:31,820 --> 01:33:36,241
Thank you. l had no idea
you chaired this benefit.

1019
01:33:36,324 --> 01:33:39,035
l'm giving a party on the 1 8th.
l'll give you a call.

1020
01:33:39,119 --> 01:33:41,538
Great. Love to.

1021
01:34:02,225 --> 01:34:03,435
Who's that?

1022
01:34:05,812 --> 01:34:07,439
Go away.

1023
01:34:27,709 --> 01:34:30,712
- What are you doing?
- l'm going swimming.

1024
01:34:30,837 --> 01:34:33,048
Don't! l don't
even want to talk to you!

1025
01:34:40,221 --> 01:34:42,432
l want to apologize.

1026
01:34:52,442 --> 01:34:54,944
You are either the biggest
closet case l've ever seen,

1027
01:34:55,028 --> 01:34:57,030
or you're just plain evil.

1028
01:34:57,113 --> 01:34:59,240
Why? l thought now
that you're straight...

1029
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:00,950
Don't get carried away.

1030
01:35:00,950 --> 01:35:04,746
- l slept with her 'cause of you.
- Me?

1031
01:35:04,746 --> 01:35:06,748
l figured you might
feel less threatened

1032
01:35:06,831 --> 01:35:09,250
if you thought l was capable
of sex with a woman.

1033
01:35:09,250 --> 01:35:12,045
l don't even know how
to respond to that, dude.

1034
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:13,630
With a straitjacket, perhaps?

1035
01:35:18,134 --> 01:35:21,429
Things went so good with Dee.
lsn't it just possible that you're...

1036
01:35:21,513 --> 01:35:22,514
No.

1037
01:35:24,432 --> 01:35:28,228
The only thing that's possible now
is l'll get beat up once too often

1038
01:35:28,311 --> 01:35:31,022
and decide to be with some woman
because l know l can.

1039
01:35:32,732 --> 01:35:34,943
lt's not exactly something
l wish l knew.

1040
01:35:34,943 --> 01:35:36,736
You can't pin that on me.

1041
01:35:36,820 --> 01:35:40,031
We can't pin anything on you
'cause you're perfect.

1042
01:35:40,115 --> 01:35:41,324
l'm not perfect!

1043
01:35:41,449 --> 01:35:44,911
Except for that little
obsessive-compulsive thing.

1044
01:35:45,036 --> 01:35:47,038
Even that makes you
kind of sexily damaged.

1045
01:35:47,122 --> 01:35:50,625
l hate people like you.
l really do.

1046
01:36:18,945 --> 01:36:20,739
Oh, my God.

1047
01:36:28,038 --> 01:36:29,748
Water's freezing.

1048
01:36:30,915 --> 01:36:33,043
Why are you doing this?

1049
01:36:33,043 --> 01:36:36,129
Doing what?
Skinny-dipping.

1050
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:42,510
Maybe l do flirt, but if l do,

1051
01:36:42,635 --> 01:36:44,429
it's only because
l want to be liked.

1052
01:36:46,514 --> 01:36:49,517
And...maybe l'm
a little confused.

1053
01:37:03,615 --> 01:37:05,533
You're not confused.

1054
01:37:07,827 --> 01:37:09,037
You like girls.

1055
01:37:12,832 --> 01:37:15,043
You're right. l do.

1056
01:37:15,126 --> 01:37:17,337
l was just trying
to give you what you want.

1057
01:37:17,420 --> 01:37:18,421
l'm an asshole.

1058
01:37:18,421 --> 01:37:21,925
Man, l don't know.
l just love attention.

1059
01:37:22,050 --> 01:37:24,427
l'm an attention junkie, l guess.

1060
01:37:26,221 --> 01:37:28,723
Why do l do shit like that?

1061
01:37:35,146 --> 01:37:36,648
Do you forgive me?

1062
01:37:40,819 --> 01:37:42,237
Do you?

1063
01:37:45,949 --> 01:37:47,325
Come on!

1064
01:37:55,041 --> 01:37:57,127
Do you? Do you forgive me?

1065
01:37:59,212 --> 01:38:00,547
Do you?

1066
01:38:00,630 --> 01:38:02,424
lf l forgive you,
will you get off of me?

1067
01:38:02,549 --> 01:38:03,925
- Yeah.
- Then no.

1068
01:38:05,135 --> 01:38:06,928
Oh, God.

1069
01:38:11,933 --> 01:38:14,728
Michael, who are you with?

1070
01:38:20,025 --> 01:38:23,528
Don't hate me.
l made up with him.

1071
01:38:28,533 --> 01:38:29,743
Where's Julie?

1072
01:38:32,412 --> 01:38:34,539
- She broke up with me.
- What?

1073
01:38:34,622 --> 01:38:37,542
She came here 'cause
she wanted to tell me in person.

1074
01:38:37,625 --> 01:38:41,838
Well, well, well. How's that
for a little opening night present?

1075
01:38:42,922 --> 01:38:45,425
How does it feel to be
on the other end, lover boy?

1076
01:38:47,135 --> 01:38:48,636
Actually...

1077
01:38:50,847 --> 01:38:53,641
- Never mind.
- What?

1078
01:38:57,228 --> 01:38:58,813
Now that camp's almost over,

1079
01:38:58,938 --> 01:39:02,025
and we live
kind of close to each other,

1080
01:39:02,150 --> 01:39:06,237
l was hoping that
we can go out sometime.

1081
01:39:09,115 --> 01:39:12,243
l know you're not asking
girlfriend out for a date after all this.

1082
01:39:12,327 --> 01:39:14,120
lf she'll forgive me.

1083
01:39:17,832 --> 01:39:19,626
This boy not only has cojohes.

1084
01:39:19,626 --> 01:39:22,045
but he's got burritos
and huevos rancheros, too.

1085
01:39:26,716 --> 01:39:28,843
- Okay.
- What?

1086
01:39:28,927 --> 01:39:30,136
Really?

1087
01:39:31,221 --> 01:39:32,430
l'll go out with you.

1088
01:39:32,514 --> 01:39:35,850
You're like
some Jenny Jones guest!

1089
01:39:35,934 --> 01:39:38,937
Eventually l have to start
hanging out with boys

1090
01:39:39,020 --> 01:39:40,647
who don't wear dresses.

1091
01:39:42,524 --> 01:39:44,651
l thought we came here
to go swimming.

1092
01:39:50,532 --> 01:39:51,741
You coming in?

1093
01:39:53,118 --> 01:39:54,452
lt's pretty cold.

1094
01:39:55,537 --> 01:39:57,831
l'll take my chances.

1095
01:40:17,851 --> 01:40:19,144
lt's not that cold.

1096
01:40:20,729 --> 01:40:22,814
Don't be a girl.
Leave that to Michael.

1097
01:40:22,939 --> 01:40:24,649
You two are like a bad car wreck.

1098
01:40:24,733 --> 01:40:27,027
l wash my hands
of the both of you!

1099
01:40:27,027 --> 01:40:28,945
lt's cold!

1100
01:40:29,946 --> 01:40:31,448
Quit splashing!

1101
01:41:05,815 --> 01:41:08,151
For the want of a nail

1102
01:41:08,234 --> 01:41:09,736
The world was lost

1103
01:41:09,736 --> 01:41:12,030
For the want of a nail

1104
01:41:12,113 --> 01:41:14,449
The world was lost

1105
01:41:14,532 --> 01:41:18,119
The want of a nail

1106
01:41:18,328 --> 01:41:21,748
The want of a nail

1107
01:41:21,831 --> 01:41:26,044
For the want of a nail,
the shoe was lost

1108
01:41:26,252 --> 01:41:29,714
For the want of a shoe,
the horse was lost

1109
01:41:29,839 --> 01:41:33,927
For the want of a horse,
the rider was lost

1110
01:41:34,052 --> 01:41:38,014
For the want of a rider,
the message was lost

1111
01:41:38,139 --> 01:41:42,143
For the want of a nail,
the world was lost

1112
01:41:42,227 --> 01:41:46,314
For the want of a nail,
the world was lost

1113
01:41:46,439 --> 01:41:50,652
The want of a nail

1114
01:41:50,819 --> 01:41:53,822
The want of a nail

1115
01:41:53,947 --> 01:41:58,326
For the want of a rider,
the message was lost

1116
01:41:58,451 --> 01:42:01,830
For the want of a message,
the battle was lost

1117
01:42:01,830 --> 01:42:06,126
For the want of a battle,
the war was lost

1118
01:42:06,126 --> 01:42:10,547
For the want of a war,
the kingdom was lost

1119
01:42:10,630 --> 01:42:14,050
The want of a nail,
the world was lost

1120
01:42:14,050 --> 01:42:17,137
The want of a nail

1121
01:42:17,220 --> 01:42:21,349
l've been wrong

1122
01:42:21,433 --> 01:42:25,937
l had plans so big

1123
01:42:26,021 --> 01:42:30,233
But the devil's in the details

1124
01:42:30,233 --> 01:42:33,737
l left out one thing

1125
01:42:33,820 --> 01:42:35,447
No one to love me

1126
01:42:35,613 --> 01:42:37,449
No one to love me

1127
01:42:45,331 --> 01:42:46,916
And no one to love

1128
01:42:54,632 --> 01:42:58,053
What's all this talk
about horses and war?

1129
01:42:58,053 --> 01:43:02,349
Put yourself in the place
of the man at the forge

1130
01:43:02,349 --> 01:43:05,935
And day after day
you live a life without love

1131
01:43:06,019 --> 01:43:08,646
Till the morning
you can't take it anymore

1132
01:43:08,730 --> 01:43:10,023
And you don't get up

1133
01:43:10,023 --> 01:43:12,025
Multiply it a billion times

1134
01:43:12,150 --> 01:43:14,319
Spread it all around the world

1135
01:43:14,319 --> 01:43:18,448
Put the curse of loneliness
on every boy and every girl

1136
01:43:18,531 --> 01:43:20,533
Until everybody's kickin',
everybody's scratchin'

1137
01:43:20,617 --> 01:43:22,243
Everything seems to fail

1138
01:43:22,327 --> 01:43:24,245
And it was all

1139
01:43:24,245 --> 01:43:26,122
All

1140
01:43:26,247 --> 01:43:30,126
For the want of a nail

1141
01:43:30,335 --> 01:43:31,628
The want of a nail

1142
01:43:31,753 --> 01:43:34,214
Tell me, what else
could the answer be?

1143
01:43:34,339 --> 01:43:38,551
The want of a nail,
not one thing

1144
01:43:38,551 --> 01:43:41,137
The want of a nail

1145
01:43:45,016 --> 01:43:48,228
Want of a nail,
the world was lost...

1146
01:45:42,050 --> 01:45:43,343
Action.

1147
01:45:48,848 --> 01:45:50,850
What a dump.

1148
01:45:50,850 --> 01:45:55,647
Hey, where's that from?
''What a dump.''

1149
01:45:58,233 --> 01:46:00,151
How would l know, Martha?

1150
01:49:36,451 --> 01:49:39,746
So you weht to this camp.
What was that like?

1151
01:49:39,746 --> 01:49:42,457
l was consistently miscast--

1152
01:49:42,540 --> 01:49:47,253
Titus Andronicus,
Stanley Kowalski.

1153
01:49:47,337 --> 01:49:50,632
Then there was the year they
couldn't find a girl to cast as Annie,

1154
01:49:50,757 --> 01:49:52,550
so l played ''Andy.''

1155
01:49:58,264 --> 01:50:02,435
Subs Fixed By
Pacman
