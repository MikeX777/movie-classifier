1
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,600
This is the story of a woman after a war...
who lived and hoped...

2
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,800
and struggled trough the anxious years,
and now saw them end...

3
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,400
and another peace begin...

4
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,600
It starts in London on VE Day, 1945.

5
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,600
'This was the day
that it started.

6
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,400
'I wish I'd been with
my wife that day,

7
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,000
'but I was not in London.

8
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,600
'It was a very special day,
meaningful in more
than one respect.

9
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,200
'Later, when Kay had told me
how it all began,

10
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,400
'I felt how strange it was

11
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,800
'that after we'd been together
through so much,

12
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,600
'sharing so many moments
of happiness,

13
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,800
'danger, war and pain,

14
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,800
'she should have been
all alone that day.

15
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,400
'I'd like to tell you something
about her, if I may.

16
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,400
'I say something because
I don't know it all,

17
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,200
'and I'm her husband.

18
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,400
'I've been her husband
for quite a long time.

19
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,200
'But does any man know
any woman completely?

20
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,600
'You meet somebody, you fall
in love with her, you marry her.

21
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,200
'You come to need her
more and more,

22
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,600
'to love her more, too.

23
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:58,000
'And when you're not with her,
you long for her
with all your heart.

24
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
'I hadn't seen my wife
for almost a year,

25
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,000
'but she'd been writing
regularly, so I knew
that she was well.

26
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:11,200
'This is her story,
Kay's story.

27
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,600
'Oh, and by the way,
our name is Miniver.

28
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,400
'Our family was scattered
around the globe.

29
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,400
'We hadn't seen each other
for years.

30
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,200
'Judy, our daughter,
was in Cairo.

31
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,600
'Our young son Toby
was in America,

32
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,000
'and I was with the Army
in Hamburg.'

33
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,000
This is London.
Please stand by.

34
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:59,200
The Prime Minister,
the Right Honourable
Winston Churchill.

35
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:06,400
Yesterday morning,
At 2.41am,

36
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,600
at General Eisenhower's
headquarters,

37
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:16,600
General Jodl, the representative
of the German high command,

38
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:24,800
and Grand Admiral Doenitz,
the designated head
of the German state,

39
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,200
signed the act
of unconditional surrender

40
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:36,600
of all German land, sea,
and air forces in Europe

41
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,000
to the Allied
Expeditionary Force.

42
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,200
The German war is, therefore,
at an end.

43
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,800
Advance, Britannia!

44
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,400
Long live the cause of freedom!

45
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,600
God save the King!

46
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,600
Mrs Miniver.

47
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,200
You don't
remember me?

48
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,000
Yes, I-I do.

49
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,800
Oh, you're Foley's boy!

50
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,200
Tom Foley,
of course!

51
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm so sorry, Tom,
but after five years...

52
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Six since I last
delivered
the groceries.

53
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,600
Are you on leave?

54
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,400
Just flew in
from Cairo.

55
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,400
Oh, what a day
to come home!

56
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,600
I'm so happy for you.

57
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,200
Does your family know?

58
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,400
Dad will be
at the station.

59
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,000
Good.
Here, have half
a suitcase.

60
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,200
Thank you.

61
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,800
Well, how are they,
Mum and Dad?

62
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,400
Oh, very good.
How's the shop?

63
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,600
Still there.

64
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,000
You had doodlebugs,
didn't you,

65
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
all around
the village?

66
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,600
Uh-huh. But it's
over now.

67
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,000
Yes.

68
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,800
How was Cairo?

69
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,200
Oh, hot as blazes.

70
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,400
My daughter's over there,
Judy, in the ATS.

71
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,800
I don't suppose
you ran into her?

72
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,000
She saw me off.

73
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,800
Tom! Well!
How is she?

74
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,200
Judy's wonderful.

75
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,800
Still a corporal?

76
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,800
She's far too nice
to be a brass hat.

77
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,200
We, um, we saw
quite a lot
of each other.

78
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,200
I'm glad.

79
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,600
It's a bit tricky,
though,

80
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,800
because of my
three pips.

81
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,800
Officers not encouraged
to mingle with
the unwashed.

82
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,200
However...

83
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,400
I haven't heard from her
for ages.

84
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,000
Now I
understand why.

85
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Oh, she...she
sent this.

86
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,400
For me?

87
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,600
Oh! That's a nice change.

88
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,200
Tom, will you forgive
me if I...?

89
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,600
Of course.
Go ahead. I'll smoke.

90
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,600
"Hello, Mother, darling.

91
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,400
"Tom Foley's just leaving
for home,

92
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,000
"so I'm dashing this off in a mad
rush in the middle of the night

93
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,800
"to let you know all's well
on the Nile.

94
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,800
"The lights are out,
and the girls are asleep,

95
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,000
"so I'm writing on my knee
in the bathroom.

96
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,400
"Who do you think I've
been driving around
for the last month?

97
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,400
"Steve Brunswick.

98
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,600
"Wherever he goes, I take him
and bring him back.

99
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,800
"It's wonderful to be
with a man who's really lived
life to the dregs."

100
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,600
All serene?

101
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,600
Yes.

102
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,800
Tom, do you know a man
called Brunswick?

103
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,400
A brigadier?

104
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,200
Brunswick...
Oh, Steve Brunswick.

105
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,400
Commando Johnny?

106
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,200
Good heavens, yes, he's
a marvellous chap. Why?

107
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,000
Oh, Judy mentions him.
He's out there now.

108
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,400
Careless talk.
She ought to be shot.

109
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,000
That's what she says.

110
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,800
Anything like her?

111
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,000
Tom, it's splendid!

112
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,800
Are you always
as good as this?

113
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,600
I happen to know this
particular subject
rather well.

114
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,000
I hope to know her
even better.

115
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,200
I'm so glad you
were at the station,
Mr Foley.

116
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,000
I just couldn't
have walked
another step today.

117
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,400
Takes it out of you,
doesn't it,

118
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,600
all this history?

119
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,200
Thank you so much.

120
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,600
All alone
here tonight?

121
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,400
Oh, no, I have
my boarders,

122
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,800
Mr Farraday
and Richard.

123
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,600
Oh, yes, well,
Mr Miniver will be

124
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,400
home before long
now, I reckon.

125
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,600
I hope so.

126
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,200
I'm delighted
Tom's back.

127
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,600
Tell Mrs Foley,
will you?

128
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600
I'll tell her.

129
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,200
I like your boy.
Good night.

130
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,200
Good night, Mrs M.
All the best.

131
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,600
Thanks, Tom.

132
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,000
Oh, could I...could I
have Judy back?

133
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,200
Oh...yes.

134
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,400
Good night.

135
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,400
Thank you, Mrs Miniver.
Good night.

136
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,400
Anybody home?

137
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,600
Spike!

138
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,800
I'll be back
in a minute.

139
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,800
Hi!

140
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,800
I just thought
I'd drop by

141
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,400
and say
congratulations.

142
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,000
Well, thank you.
Have I won anything?

143
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Only a war.

144
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,600
From here in, Kay,
you're a veteran.

145
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,600
You, too, Colonel.

146
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,400
Well, that puts me
in nice company.
Let's shake on it.

147
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,200
We might even have
a cup of tea on it.
Come inside.

148
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,400
I'm due back at the
base right now.

149
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,800
But I was hoping
you might care

150
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,000
to look in at the
George with me later.

151
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,200
I guess most of the
village will be there.

152
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,800
Kind of
a farewell visit.

153
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,200
Farewell?

154
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,600
We're pulling out
Sunday.

155
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,400
Oh, no, Spike.

156
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,800
Oh, I am sorry.

157
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,600
I did want you
and Clem to meet.

158
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,800
I know.

159
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,000
I sort of, er,
wanted to say hello

160
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,200
to that husband
of yours myself.

161
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,800
He must be
quite a guy.

162
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,400
Will you come?
Please.

163
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,000
I'd love to.

164
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,800
Swell. Pick you
up at 8.30.

165
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,200
We're going to
miss you in the village.

166
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,800
We're going to miss
the village.

167
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:12,000
Somehow, I just can't
believe that it's over.

168
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It isn't.

169
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,800
Sure, some of the
fighting's stopped.

170
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,400
A few generals have
signed some documents
on Lueneburg Heath.

171
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,400
For the rest of us,
you can't just snap
your fingers and say,

172
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,800
"Forget it, brother.
Go on home.

173
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,400
"Take up the old
routine where you
left off."

174
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,600
When a war happens,

175
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,800
a whole new life happens
along with it.

176
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,800
And you're a part
of mine, Kay...

177
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,200
a very important part.

178
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,200
Well, I know we haven't
seen each other

179
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,400
more than...how often?
A dozen times?

180
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,800
Tea in the garden
after a mission,

181
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,600
a couple of movies,
watching a soccer match.

182
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,800
Probably it doesn't mean
very much to you,

183
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,000
but it's helped,
more than you know.

184
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,000
I didn't stop
loving Ellen

185
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
when I started
to love you.

186
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Dear Kay, don't look
so worried.

187
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,200
I'm not expecting
you to say anything

188
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,200
except maybe
"Here's a guy I knew
in the war.

189
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,600
"Nice to have met him."

190
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,600
I know it's all
on my side.

191
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,000
You're married.

192
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,800
You too, Spike.

193
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:33,400
Only I'm here,
and Ellen's there.

194
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Sort of a mess
I'm in, all right.

195
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,000
Oh, you'll snap
out of it.

196
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,000
Very un-British,
shooting my mouth off.

197
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,400
Only, this is
our last evening.

198
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,600
And I just had
to tell you.

199
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,200
You're not mad
at me?

200
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,400
No, Spike, I'm not mad.

201
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:08,400
It's...it's nice to know
that one's been of use,

202
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,600
if I have.

203
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,600
Let's dance.

204
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,800
My friends!

205
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,400
Tonight, Europe is free!

206
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,400
To the British
I say, "Jolly decent of you!"

207
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,600
To the Americans,
"Nice work, kids!"

208
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:51,200
To my own country, I say
"God bless you."

209
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:58,000
Very soon now, I return to
you and to my dear wife
and children.

210
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,800
Don't worry, darling.
Not tonight.

211
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,400
And so to all of you,

212
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,200
to all the people and armies
of liberation,

213
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,400
on behalf of all Europe,

214
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,600
tonight, I say...

215
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,400
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

216
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,200
Won't you say
something, Colonel?

217
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,400
Please?

218
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,200
Well, this isn't
quite my line.

219
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,400
You go ahead.

220
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,600
Oh, no.

221
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,600
Come on, Spike.
Do it. It would be nice.

222
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,800
OK.

223
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,000
Thanks, pal.

224
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,400
American...
here.

225
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:58,600
I guess some of us
will be leaving soon.

226
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,000
So, maybe I'd better make
this goodbye.

227
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,600
When we first came
to England,

228
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,600
we weren't too keen
about the idea.

229
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,400
"It's murder,"
they told us.

230
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,800
"Rains all day, and the folks
keep themselves to themselves."

231
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,400
Well, it rained.
They were right there.

232
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,200
We've had bad times
and good times.

233
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,200
We've had an awful lot
of war together.

234
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,400
So long, England.

235
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,600
Thanks for everything.

236
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,000
And have yourselves
a good rest.

237
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,800
For he's a jolly good fellow

238
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,800
He's a jolly good fellow

239
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,000
For he's a jolly good fellow

240
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,200
And so say all of us.

241
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,000
'It was a beautiful summer,

242
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
'that first summer of peace.

243
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,400
'England had a new kind
of government,

244
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,800
'the world had a new kind
of a bomb,

245
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:18,000
'and the weather was perfect
day after day.

246
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,400
'It was as if God were saying,

247
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,800
' "This is what life could be like
if only you'd let it."

248
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,000
'It was still a beautiful summer
when I said goodbye to Europe.

249
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,200
'The weather was perfect.

250
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,000
'Two hours later, we were home.

251
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,400
'I was the last of the family
to come home.

252
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,400
'Judy had just returned
from Cairo,

253
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,600
'Toby, from America.

254
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,200
'At long last, the four of us
were home.

255
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,200
'And I was looking forward to
a holiday of rest and happiness

256
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,400
'with Kay and the children.'

257
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,400
How long has this
been going on?

258
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,600
About 12 months.

259
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,200
About 12 months?

260
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,000
There's one up
in Toby's room, too.

261
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,800
Is that so?

262
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,200
And another
in the kitchen,

263
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,400
but that's over the sink,
so that doesn't matter.

264
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,400
Nothing matters.

265
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,200
You're home.

266
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,600
It's about time.

267
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,400
Yes.

268
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,800
Listen to that, Dad!

269
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,600
Mary Lou gave me
a dozen records

270
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,000
the day I left
the States.

271
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,200
Let's get this
coat off.

272
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,800
Who's Mary Lou?

273
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,200
My girl!
She's super!

274
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,400
Super?

275
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,400
Yes! She cuts about
the meanest rug
in Morgan Falls.

276
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,600
Oh, she does?

277
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,000
Yeah, we were going steady
until peace came
and wrecked everything.

278
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,200
Mary Lou's 10.

279
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,800
Oh, she'll be 11
in March.

280
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,400
Well, that's different.

281
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,800
Sorry, Dad.
That's mine.

282
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,800
What is it?

283
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,800
Baseball.

284
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,200
No, no, not like that.
Let me show you.

285
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,800
Batter up!

286
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,000
What?

287
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Batter up!

288
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,600
Home run!

289
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,200
Home run?

290
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,200
Yeah!

291
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,000
All right,
I'll answer it.

292
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,200
It's for me.
It's for me.

293
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,400
Hello, Steve.

294
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,400
I'm sorry.
I can't hear.

295
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,200
Who?
Oh, it's you.

296
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,600
Toby. Teddy Fathergill.

297
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,200
Excuse me, Dad.

298
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,200
She was easier to understand
when she was younger.

299
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,200
< So were you.

300
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,600
Hiya, Teddy.
Yes, we just brought
Dad home.

301
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,000
No, I can't make it
tonight.

302
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,200
I told you.
My father.

303
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,400
Back from the war
and all that.

304
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,200
I have to stand by
and look happy.

305
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,600
OK, bye, Teddy.

306
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,800
Who is, um...
Who's Teddy?

307
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,600
He's a friend of mine.
Teddy Fathergill.

308
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,600
He's English, of course.

309
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,400
Ah, that's too bad.

310
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,800
Say, Dad. You look
kind of lost.

311
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,200
Why don't you give
the body a break

312
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,200
and go dunk yourself
in the drink?

313
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,000
Uh...drink?

314
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,200
I mean, take a nice
plunge in the dipper

315
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,800
and have yourself
a rubdown.

316
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,800
Well, thank you, Toby.
Thank you very much.

317
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,200
You're welcome.

318
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,600
I say, Dad! Will you get
a load of that horn!

319
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,600
Batter...
Batter up.

320
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Everything all right,
darling?

321
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,800
Fine, fine. I'm about to dunk
myself in the drink,

322
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,800
get a load of a rubdown,
and have myself a fine dip
in the plunger.

323
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,400
I may also cut a few
carpets if I have time.

324
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,800
Oh, and by the way,
I just made a home run.

325
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:31,600
Dee dee da something
something something something

326
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,400
Goes in there

327
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,000
Then the lights go on
again...

328
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,600
Come in.

329
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,000
Feeling better?

330
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,400
I feel fine, wonderful,
magnificent. Don't I look it?

331
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,200
You look sweet.

332
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,200
Thank you. >

333
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,400
So do you.

334
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,600
Come here
a minute.

335
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,400
Gosh, that's
frightening.

336
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,600
What is?

337
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,000
You...grown up.

338
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,800
And really quite
lovely, if I may
say so.

339
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,400
You may say so.

340
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,400
Oh, it's wonderful to have
you back again!

341
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,200
It's good to be back.
Believe me.

342
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,800
Hand me my socks
there, will you?

343
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,000
Well, young lady,
how's everything?

344
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
How many hearts have
you broken already?

345
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,400
I don't know why
it's a shock

346
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,800
to discover you have
a beautiful daughter,
but it is.

347
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:40,600
You know, when you
were, oh,
six months old,

348
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,400
you were the ugliest
thing I've ever seen
in my life.

349
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,800
Yes, you were.

350
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,200
You took after me
then.

351
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,200
Whereas now you
take after your mother.

352
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,200
Ah, yes, you do.

353
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,400
I can see we're going
to have a lot of trouble
with you.

354
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,000
Father?

355
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,200
Can we talk?
Just for a minute.

356
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,400
Seriously, I mean.
Alone.

357
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,000
Oh, well, I think that
might be arranged.

358
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,600
I'm afraid I'm going
to shock you again,

359
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,200
and this time, I don't
think you'll like it.

360
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,200
I want you to know
right away.

361
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,800
There's no secret
about it.

362
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,200
Mother knows,
but I'd rather you
heard it from me.

363
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,800
Father, you know
Steve Brunswick,
don't you?

364
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,600
Well, I...I don't
know him.

365
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,800
I've heard of him,
of course. Why?

366
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,000
I'm in love
with him.

367
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,600
He's a little old
for you, isn't he, darling?

368
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,400
38, but that
doesn't matter.

369
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,200
I mean, if that
was all...

370
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,600
He understands me,

371
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,400
and I think I
understand him.

372
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,400
Is that so difficult?

373
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,800
Yes, it is, rather.

374
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,600
We met in Cairo
at the end of the war.

375
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,200
He's home now.

376
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,800
We've seen each other
several times.

377
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,800
Is he in love
with you?

378
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,800
I don't know yet.

379
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,400
I think so.

380
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,600
I hope so.

381
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,000
Well, then, everything
seems to be

382
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,400
more or less satisfactory,
as far as it goes.

383
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,600
No, it isn't.

384
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,600
You see, he's married.

385
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,000
He has been for 12 years.

386
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,200
His wife is Pamela Lyndon,
you know, the pianist.

387
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,400
She's awfully nice,
I believe.

388
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,600
They used to have
dreadful rows,

389
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,200
but that was Steve's fault.
At least, he said so.

390
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,800
It's probably true.
And then he met me.

391
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,800
We have rows, too,
but I don't mind it.

392
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,400
He's like that,
you know, temperamental.

393
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,600
I love him so terribly.

394
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,600
I-I thought it was
just the war,

395
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,800
and I'd get over it,

396
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:11,000
but it wasn't and I...
I haven't.

397
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,600
And now, it's worse
than ever.

398
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,400
And I...

399
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,600
Thanks.

400
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,000
I suppose I should
tell you

401
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,800
all the wise and sensible
things a father's supposed
to have up his sleeve

402
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,400
for these occasions,

403
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,600
but I'm not sure
that I know them.

404
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,400
And I'm not so sure
they'd help very much.

405
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,600
Would they, huh?

406
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,400
I'm awfully sorry.

407
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,600
Food!

408
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,000
Life's quite a business,
isn't it, then?

409
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Uh...all right?

410
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,200
Very nice, darling.

411
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,200
A little tight
around the middle.

412
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,800
I seem
to have grown.

413
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,200
You know this is
the first time

414
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,200
we've all been together
since 1940?

415
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,400
Yes, it is.

416
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,600
Why, it's quite
an occasion, isn't it?

417
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,800
Shall I make a speech?

418
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,200
No? Well, all right,
all right.

419
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,800
All together, huh?

420
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,600
Sorry, darling, what
were you going to say?

421
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,600
Nothing. This soup,
good stuff.

422
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,000
You haven't lost
your touch.

423
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,800
Bits and pieces
from yesterday.

424
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,000
Rather appropriate.

425
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Dad?
Huh?

426
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,600
Have you got
any souvenirs?

427
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,200
What of exactly,
Toby?

428
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,800
You know, Europe.

429
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,400
Scars of battle.

430
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,000
Mary Lou's father
was on Guadalcanal.

431
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Killed four Japs
in 20 minutes.

432
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,000
Brought home a Samurai sword
he stripped off one
of the corpses.

433
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,600
Toby!

434
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,400
That's the kind they use
to commit hara-kiri.

435
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,400
Push the hilt of the sword
in the ground

436
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,200
and jam your belly
hard on the blade.

437
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,000
Works like thunder.

438
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,400
Splits their gizzards
from top to bottom.

439
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,800
Like this.

440
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,400
Oh, Toby, shut up.
We'll all be sick.

441
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,800
Been like this
for days.

442
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,000
America was
a bad mistake.

443
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,400
Will you do me
a favour? Collapse.

444
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,000
Toby, darling,
would you do
something for me?

445
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,400
Of course, Mother.
Anything.

446
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,200
Forget about those
48 states for 24 hours

447
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,000
and try and make do
with your unfortunate family.

448
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,600
I'll go!

449
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,600
You know, Toby,
I'm afraid I'm going

450
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,600
to prove a grave
disappointment to you.

451
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,000
No medals, no trophies,
no scars.

452
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I've still got both arms
and both legs.

453
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,200
My eyes are a bit
groggy,

454
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,400
and I'm afraid I'm
going to need glasses.

455
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,600
But that's the best
I can do for you.

456
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,000
As a homecoming warrior,
I'm a complete washout.

457
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,400
You're OK, Dad.

458
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,800
You went to Dunkirk.

459
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
It's Steve!

460
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,000
He's at the Majestic
in Roxbury.

461
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,000
He's asked me over
for dinner.

462
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Darling, would you think
it simply dreadful if...?

463
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,800
Oh, no, Judy.
Not tonight.

464
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,600
I know it's awful,
but I won't be late.

465
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,000
And I haven't seen him
for 10 days.

466
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Oh, it's not that, it's...

467
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,200
As a matter
of fact,

468
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,800
I'd be rather glad
to get rid of the brat.

469
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,800
Then I could have you
to myself.

470
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,800
All right, Judy.

471
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,200
She's all mixed up.

472
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,400
Can't eat, can't sleep,
can't do anything.

473
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,200
I was like that with Mary Lou
the first two weeks,

474
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,200
but we came through OK.

475
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,800
You just have to adjust.

476
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,400
Yeah.

477
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,000
Gosh! If you really mean
that about being alone,

478
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,200
I guess I'll go and see
Teddy Fathergill.

479
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,400
He's all mixed up, too.

480
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,800
Really?

481
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,800
His dad's a socialist.
Gotta straighten him out.

482
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,400
Go right ahead,
Toby, and leave
the old folks at home.

483
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,600
OK.

484
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,800
Goodbye, boy.

485
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,800
Bye!

486
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,000
Bye.

487
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Bye.

488
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,800
Hello, darling.

489
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,400
'I remember
that evening for lots
of reasons.

490
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,000
'The homecoming, the way
Kay looked, the kids.

491
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,200
'After they'd gone, we cleared
the meal away and went out.

492
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,600
'The rain had stopped,
and there was that strange light
over everything

493
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,200
'that comes so often in England
at the end of summer,

494
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,000
'when it's a little too early
to put on the lamps

495
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,800
'and a little too late to see
everything clearly and true.

496
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,600
'We made a sentimental journey
around the garden.

497
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,200
'It was good to be alone...
and together.

498
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,400
'This is Kay's story, not mine,

499
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:49,400
'but I have to tell that evening
through my eyes, not hers.

500
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,000
'I don't think there's
very much difference.

501
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,200
'It was full of all kinds
of memories, gay and grim.

502
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,200
'Extraordinary, the wide swing
from the fear and terror
of those nights in the shelter

503
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,600
'to the utter peace of the river
that night I came home.

504
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,800
'It was good to see
the old lady once more.

505
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,400
'She was beyond repair,
and we never used her again.

506
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,000
'We couldn't afford it,
and we hadn't the petrol.

507
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,400
'But she, too, was full of
memories for both of us.'

508
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,200
No petrol.

509
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,800
I wonder if...

510
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,600
I seem to remember
that there was a...

511
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,800
Huh?

512
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,000
Yes.

513
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,600
There might be
a drop in it.

514
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,400
Yeah, good.

515
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Five years old,
that stuff.

516
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,000
Dunkirk spirit.
Still works.

517
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,200
Let's hope so.

518
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,000
Hello, sir.

519
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,600
Hello, Captain.

520
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,200
I heard you were
back, sir,

521
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:14,200
so I thought I'd just
drop by and say welcome home.

522
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,400
Thank you,
Captain.

523
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,000
Who is it?

524
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Foley's boy.

525
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,200
Thank you, Tom.

526
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,800
Thank you
very much.

527
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,000
Delighted to see you.

528
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,400
We've, er, just been
to Dunkirk.

529
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,000
Come aboard, Tom.

530
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,400
Oh, thank you.

531
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,600
Well, Tom Foley.
When did you get back?

532
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,800
VE Day, sir.

533
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,200
Hm, lucky fellow.

534
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,200
Have a good war?

535
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,400
Oh, fair to middling,
you know, sir.

536
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,000
Am, uh...Europe?

537
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,600
No, sir.
Desert mostly.

538
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,200
Cairo and the Middle East.

539
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,200
Cairo?

540
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,800
Well, our girl,
Judy, was out there
with the ATS.

541
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,000
I don't suppose you
saw anything of her?

542
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,600
Well, funnily enough, sir,
I did bump into her.

543
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,600
Did you hear that,
darling?

544
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,000
Tom Foley here met
Judy out in Cairo.

545
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,400
Well, well! You must
come over and say
hello to her sometime.

546
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,400
She's home now,
you know.

547
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,400
Yes, yes, I know, sir.

548
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,000
I'm afraid she's out
for the evening, Tom.

549
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,400
Oh, really?

550
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,400
Well, goodbye, sir,

551
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,600
and it's really great
having you back.

552
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,000
Thank you, Tom.

553
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,600
Thank you very
much indeed!

554
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,600
I'll tell Judy
I saw you.

555
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,600
Oh, don't bother.

556
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,000
I just dropped by
to say hello to Mr Miniver,

557
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,000
that's all.

558
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,600
Goodbye!

559
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,800
Goodbye, Tom Foley.

560
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,400
You know that I've
hardly said two words

561
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,600
to that boy in my life,

562
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,800
and yet he takes
the trouble

563
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,800
to ride over here
this evening

564
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,400
simply to welcome
me home?

565
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,800
I call that
extraordinarily decent
of him, don't you?

566
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,000
Yes, dear, I do.

567
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,400
There's some days
you don't like to see go.

568
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,600
I'd like to put
the clock back and have
this one all over again.

569
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,400
The rain...
roof leaking...
everything.

570
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,200
Yes, it's been
a lovely day.

571
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,400
Judy's not home yet.

572
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,600
Still striking.

573
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,600
Give Cinderella
till the last chime.

574
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,600
There she is now.

575
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Worried about her?

576
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,400
Yes...aren't you?

577
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,400
Yes.

578
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,400
I could talk to her.

579
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,400
I tried.

580
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:51,200
I don't think you can
talk someone out of love.

581
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,000
What are we going
to do about it?

582
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,800
Wait, I think.

583
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,400
Of course,
we could ask Toby to
straighten her out.

584
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,600
I wish she'd find
someone like you.

585
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,400
Well, that's
a tall order,

586
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,600
rather like
reaching for the moon.

587
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,800
I'm in.
Good night, darlings!

588
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Judy? Did you have
a good time?

589
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,600
You don't have
a good time with Steve.

590
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,400
He's not like that.

591
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,000
What is he like?

592
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,800
Different.

593
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,600
Good night, Father.

594
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,800
Apparently that's
the technique these days.

595
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,200
In order to be a success
with the modern girl,
you have to be different.

596
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,200
Uh...was I different when
you married me, darling?

597
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,600
You were unique.

598
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,400
Unique?

599
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,800
Unique...

600
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,400
Of course it's nice
to see you again, darling.

601
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,800
But...the real joy
of coming home

602
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,800
is to be able to stand
in your own bathroom once more.

603
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,400
Brush your own teeth
in your own hot water!

604
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,000
Don't know
how lucky you are!

605
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,200
Hot water, soap...

606
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,800
all the delights
of civilization,

607
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,600
right at your fingertips.

608
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:04,000
If I could have...found
a bathroom like this,

609
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,600
I probably never would have
come home at all.

610
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,600
Ahh, that was wonderful.

611
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,800
It's funny the pleasure
you can get out of a simple...

612
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,600
Kay?

613
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,600
What is it?

614
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,000
Darling, you're...
you're so pale.

615
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,200
Am I?

616
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,600
It's...light...

617
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,200
What's this?

618
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,800
Well, it's...just...

619
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,200
it's something for
when you feel faint.

620
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,800
Feel faint?

621
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,400
Don't look
so worried, darling.

622
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,800
But I am worried.
I'm scared stiff!

623
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:15,000
It's...it's all right.
I just get a little...
dizzy spell now and then.

624
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:21,400
When it happens, then I...
take two of these little things,

625
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,000
and...I feel fine.

626
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,200
You mean you've
had this sort
of thing before?

627
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,400
Occasionally,
not for ages.

628
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,400
But why didn't
you tell me?

629
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,800
Darling, it's just
a giddy turn.

630
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,400
Had to happen tonight.

631
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,600
Haven't had one
for months.

632
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,800
It's your fault...
coming home,
getting me all excited.

633
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:50,400
Now, do you...really
feel all right now?

634
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,400
Of course, darling.

635
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,400
Now don't make a fuss,
there's a dear.

636
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:01,400
You frightened
the life out of me.

637
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,800
Oh, poor darling.

638
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,800
High time I got
home. You've been
overdoing it.

639
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,400
Oh, don't be
an old woman.

640
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,800
I'm not.
But I'd like you
to be, one day.

641
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,800
Don't rush me.

642
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,000
Anything else
you haven't told me?

643
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,600
Any lovers tucked away
that I don't know about?

644
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,600
Dozens.

645
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,000
Just what I thought.

646
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,600
And you?

647
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,000
Hundreds.

648
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,200
Dotted all over Europe,

649
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,400
from Normandy
to the Rhine.

650
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,000
They're going to be
lonely tonight.

651
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,400
Nice talk,
Mrs Miniver.

652
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,600
Stop a minute,
darlings.

653
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,200
I wonder,
is the doctor in?

654
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,800
Yes, but have you
an appointment?

655
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:24,200
No, not today, but
I did rather want
to see him for a second

656
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,600
if he could squeeze me in.

657
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,200
Well, I'm not sure.
Is it urgent?

658
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:32,400
Not urgent, but,
well, important.

659
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,800
I wouldn't be more
than five minutes.

660
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,600
Come in, won't you?

661
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,200
I'm Mrs Kanesley,
and you're...?

662
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,600
Mrs Miniver.
Oh, yes.

663
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,000
Harry's really not
seeing anyone today.

664
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,800
It's my birthday.

665
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Oh. Oh, I am sorry.

666
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,800
Not that it's your birthday,
but for disturbing you.

667
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,200
Doctors' wives see
so little of their
husbands, don't they?

668
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,800
We get used to it.

669
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,800
The children.

670
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,600
A children's party!

671
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,600
Oh, I couldn't spoil that.
Don't bother, I'll go.

672
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,200
I'll get it!

673
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,800
Mrs Miniver, hello!

674
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I'm so sorry about all this.
Come in, won't you?

675
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Thank you.

676
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,600
Let's see...you don't know
my three offspring, do you?

677
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,400
The others
are on loan.

678
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,800
Hello, where
is everybody?

679
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,000
Hello, come here, come on,
come and say hello.

680
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,200
Now, this is Michael.

681
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,000
Hello.
How do you do,
Michael?

682
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
That is Susan.

683
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,800
Hello.
How do you do,
Susan?

684
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,200
And that is Joanie.

685
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,000
How do you do,
Joanie?

686
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,400
She only
does that if
she likes you.

687
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,000
All right,
darling,
that'll do.

688
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,800
You run away
and play with yourself.

689
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,000
Fall out, you two.

690
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,200
How about
a cup of tea?

691
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,400
Oh, no, thank you.
I really do feel
horribly guilty

692
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,200
intruding like this
on your one day off.

693
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,000
Nonsense. One of
the few women I'd get up for
in the middle of the night.

694
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,200
I see what
he means.

695
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,600
Why haven't
we met before?

696
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,400
I've never been
ill before.

697
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,800
Oh, are you?
I'm sorry. You
look splendid.

698
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,200
Let's go in here,
shall we?

699
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,000
Just for five minutes.

700
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,600
How lovely the park
looks today, doesn't it?

701
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,800
Yes, autumn.

702
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,600
Strange melancholy
time of year.

703
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,800
Do you think so?

704
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,600
I rather like it.

705
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:27,000
I've been sitting outside
there under the trees
for the last half hour,

706
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,400
watching the leaves fall
and trying to screw up enough
courage to come in and see you.

707
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,200
Why, was it
so difficult?

708
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,200
You don't smoke,
do you?
No, thank you.

709
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,400
Yes, it was...very.

710
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,400
I had no idea coming
to see the doctor could
be such an adventure.

711
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,000
Oh, it is always...

712
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,800
especially today.

713
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,000
Today?

714
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,200
Oh! Today I'm less
alarming than ever.

715
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:51,400
Do you like wildflowers?
They're rather a hobby
of mine.

716
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:55,400
Limonium vulgare,
what we call
sea lavender.

717
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,000
Charming name,
isn't it?

718
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,600
You know, flowers get
called after all sorts
of things,

719
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,600
where they're found,
people who find them.

720
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,400
It's fascinating
sometimes.

721
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,200
Rosa canina,
wild rose.

722
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,800
Rose...

723
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,800
Once a few years ago,
someone...

724
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,000
Oh, nothing...memories.

725
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,400
Tell me, please.

726
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,000
Not just now.

727
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,400
You're going to
tell me something.

728
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,000
Something I want to know.

729
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,400
You are, aren't you?

730
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,400
Well, that rather
depends what it is.

731
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,400
You know what it is.

732
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,800
How long have I got?

733
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,000
Please.

734
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,200
It's all right,
I want to know.

735
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,000
I realise you're not
supposed to tell me.

736
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,400
It's...bad
for the patient.

737
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,800
Professional ethics,
and all sorts
of reasons.

738
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,800
A few months ago, when
you first hinted that
it might be serious,

739
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:01,200
I...I was glad of them.

740
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,800
I preferred to
clutch at straws,

741
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,800
and pretend to myself.

742
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,000
But I've changed my mind.

743
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,200
It's a woman's
privilege.

744
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,200
Well...I'm right,
aren't I?

745
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Is your husband back?

746
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,200
Yes, two days ago,
and the children.

747
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:35,400
That's the chief reason
I'm here today, the family.

748
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,800
There's so much to do,
and there's just...

749
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,000
so much time to do it in.

750
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:47,000
And so I...
I want to know how much.

751
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,800
Please.

752
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,400
You're not afraid,
are you?

753
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,600
I'm not sure.

754
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,000
I mind, of course.

755
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,600
I love my husband
very much.

756
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,600
He's going to miss me
dreadfully.

757
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,600
That sounds vain and conceited,
but it isn't, really.

758
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:10,400
It's been rather
a perfect marriage.

759
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,200
No, I don't think
I'm afraid.

760
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:20,400
One's become accustomed to...
to death these last few years.

761
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,600
So many went, the young ones.

762
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:27,000
It's a tragedy
when the young ones go.

763
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,600
An older person getting
an illness that can't be cured...

764
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,400
well, that's just bad luck.

765
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,800
I say rather
that's it's a pity.

766
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,600
I'm not sorry for myself,

767
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:44,200
and honestly,
I don't want anyone else
to be sorry for me.

768
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,800
Does your
husband know?

769
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,000
Not yet.

770
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,800
Well, I think
he should.

771
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,200
I'll tell him...
at the right moment.

772
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,000
How will you know
when that is?

773
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,400
I'll know.

774
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,200
Now, be a nice man
and tell me...

775
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,000
how long?

776
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,800
Not less than six months,
not more than a year.

777
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,000
Thank you.

778
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,600
Sorry, that was hard,
wasn't it?

779
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:32,400
Look. I'm the doctor,
you're the patient,
you remember?

780
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,400
I'll try.

781
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,000
10 out of 10
for you.

782
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,800
What's that?

783
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,400
Full marks.

784
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,200
Hello, darling.

785
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,400
Busy?

786
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,000
No, come in.

787
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,400
I didn't know
you were in town today.

788
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,800
I've been shopping.

789
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:33,400
Quite suddenly I...
I thought I'd like you
to take me home.

790
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,200
When you're ready, I mean.
There's no hurry.

791
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,000
I shan't be two minutes.

792
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,400
No hurry.

793
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,000
What is it?

794
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,600
You've changed.

795
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,600
Changed?

796
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:57,200
Yes. Since
this morning.

797
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,400
Something's different. You, er...

798
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Oh, yes...
it's the hat. New, isn't it?

799
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,000
Like it?

800
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,400
Very becoming.
You do look nice.

801
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,800
It's the first new one
I've had for five...no, six years.

802
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,400
Why today suddenly?

803
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:27,600
I don't know...
just felt like it.

804
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:32,000
Sometimes a new hat
does something for you.

805
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,600
I know.

806
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,600
Only this morning,
I was saying
to myself,

807
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:39,000
"Miniver," I said, "Why
don't you buy yourself
a new bowler?

808
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,800
"Might do something
for you."

809
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,400
You had a good day?

810
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,200
Oh, so-so.

811
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:51,600
Somehow the prospect of
starting in again on my own
isn't wildly exciting.

812
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,200
You might take
an apprentice.

813
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,400
Do you know of any
good young draftsmen
hanging about?

814
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,400
Foley's boy draws very well.

815
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,800
I saw some sketches
he did of Judy,
and they were excellent.

816
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,000
He's a nice boy,
too, Clem.

817
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:11,000
I rather wish
that Judy would...

818
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,000
Do you like nuts?

819
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:19,000
Yes...
Yes, I like nuts.

820
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:26,800
"We in Brazil have
in mind a certain
building project

821
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,800
"along modern
European lines,

822
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,000
"and our minister
of highways and
civil construction,

823
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,600
"Senor Jose
Antonio Campos,

824
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:39,000
"will be visiting Europe
shortly to discuss
this project.

825
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
"Tenders will be invited
from the most vigorous

826
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
"and enterprising
architects of the day."

827
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,000
I've just
written to him.

828
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,800
Oh.

829
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,600
Aren't I vigorous
and enterprising?

830
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,200
Yes, darling.

831
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,200
Wouldn't you like to go
and live in Brazil?

832
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,200
What?

833
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,000
Wouldn't you like
to get out and away
from all this,

834
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,800
miles away, where
the sun shines

835
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,200
and there aren't
any ruins on
your doorstep?

836
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,200
Kay...

837
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,800
I can't tell you
what it was like
going across Europe.

838
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,400
Through one country
after another,

839
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:12,400
the desolation
and the emptiness,

840
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,000
the sense of
utter futility.

841
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,400
It got into me, somehow,
and I just can't seem
to shake it off.

842
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,200
England isn't Europe.

843
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,200
It's too close!
It belongs!

844
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:27,200
We could take the kids
and clear out.

845
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,000
We still got a good
few years together.

846
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,200
Other people are doing
it. They're making
a fresh start abroad.

847
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,600
What do you say?

848
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
It's out of the clear sky.

849
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,800
I...I wasn't expecting it.

850
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:45,200
You've only
just come home.

851
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,600
I'm thinking
of the future.

852
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,600
That's an old one.

853
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,400
What is it?

854
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,000
Let's dance.

855
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,200
Dance?

856
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,600
Where? When?

857
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,400
Here. Now.

858
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:30,400
'She meant it.
I didn't know why...

859
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:34,200
'only that she meant it,
quite seriously.

860
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,000
'As I took her hands,

861
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,800
'I remember thinking
she had changed.

862
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:45,400
'It wasn't just the hat,
it was Kay.

863
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:51,200
'There was something...
elusive about her suddenly.

864
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,200
'Something...intangible.

865
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:00,400
'So, there in the office,
we danced.'

866
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,200
Hell's bells!

867
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:27,400
Very funny.

868
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,400
Darling, are
you all right?

869
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:32,200
Maimed for life,
I should think.

870
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,600
There's
a car coming.

871
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,200
Hello.
Breakdown?

872
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,400
Yes, ignition failure.
Coil's gone.

873
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,000
Oh, I'm afraid that's
a garage job. I'll have
a look if you like.

874
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,800
No, it's all right.
I've got help coming.

875
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,000
Tom!

876
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,400
Hello!

877
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,000
Oh, friend of yours?

878
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,400
Yes, sir! Foley,
late captain,
Royal Engineers.

879
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,800
Oh, I'm Brunswick.

880
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Yes, I know, sir. You gave us
a pep talk in Cairo,
before Alamein.

881
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,200
Was I good?

882
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,400
Well, you were
short, sir.

883
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,800
Oh...pleased to
meet you, Foley.

884
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,000
Demobbed?

885
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,800
Yes, sir. I got
out under class C.

886
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,000
Lucky blighter.

887
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Wouldn't have a cigarette
on you, would you?

888
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,400
I think so.

889
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,800
Where are you off to
at this ungodly hour?

890
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,200
Oh, it's market day.
Dad keeps the grocery
shop in Belham.

891
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,400
Belham?

892
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,800
Steve, do get in.
You'll catch cold!

893
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,600
Is your van full up?

894
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:25,800
How do you mean?

895
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,600
Be a good chap
and give Miss Miniver
a ride home.

896
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,600
Surely.

897
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,600
No, Steve,
I'm staying with you.

898
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:35,200
You'll do as you're told.
You're with the Army
now...right?

899
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,200
Right!

900
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:40,000
I've got a pig on board,
but there's room for one more.

901
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,400
Out you come.

902
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,200
Steve, please
let me stay.
I'd much rather.

903
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,400
Shut up.

904
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:48,600
You'll freeze.

905
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:49,800
Shut up!

906
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,800
Please, Steve,
please.

907
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,200
Do as you're told
and don't argue.

908
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:57,200
It's a man's world
and you won't
accept it.

909
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,600
Don't you agree,
Captain?

910
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,000
Oh, yes, sir,
absolutely.

911
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Come on, then.

912
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:06,000
If she makes any
trouble, wallop her.
That's an order.

913
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,400
Yes, sir.

914
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,200
Steve, when
will I see you?

915
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,800
Oh, your
cigarettes.

916
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:11,800
Oh, keep 'em, sir.

917
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,200
Thank you, Captain.

918
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,800
You'd be a major
for this if the war
weren't over.

919
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,400
I'll see what I can do
for you in the next one!

920
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,400
Go away!

921
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,800
Where on earth did
you get that thing?

922
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,600
He's not a thing.
He's a noble beast.

923
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:56,600
Aren't you, George?

924
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,800
He smells.

925
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,400
Is he yours?

926
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,400
No.

927
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,600
All right,
George. Go on.

928
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:11,200
No, I'm collecting
him for the Nesbits.

929
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,600
He's a breeder.

930
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,800
Have you
known him long?

931
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,400
Who?

932
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,800
Brigadier Brunswick.

933
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,200
He's a general.

934
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,200
OK, General Brunswick.

935
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,600
Have you?

936
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:27,800
Yes.

937
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
How long?

938
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,400
Ages.

939
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:33,800
Like him?

940
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,600
He's a wonderful
person.

941
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,200
In war or peace?

942
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,400
Both!

943
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,800
Does he, er,
dance well?

944
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,600
He does
everything well.

945
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,400
That's why I've
seen nothing of you
since Cairo.

946
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,600
You've seen me.

947
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,400
At the shop in the queue
a couple of times.

948
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,000
You can't make love
to a girl in a queue.

949
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,800
Well, don't
look so shocked.

950
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,200
I used to, quite a bit,
in the Middle East.

951
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,000
When you were just
a dumb little corporal

952
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,400
with a couple
of stripes.

953
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,000
Yes, and you didn't
mind it, either.

954
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,800
In fact, you liked it,
didn't you?

955
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,600
Yes, Tom, I did.

956
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,200
I liked it.

957
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,400
Well?

958
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,000
Well, it's
different now.

959
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,200
I'm not.

960
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,800
Well, I'm not
either, really,
only I...

961
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,200
Oh, what's the use?

962
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:31,000
Ha ha ha! You are
miserable, are you?

963
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
No, I'm not.

964
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,600
I'm wildly,
wildly happy,

965
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,200
and I'm going
on being happy
with Steve

966
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,800
and I don't care
what anyone thinks.

967
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,800
No-one thinks
anything, do they?

968
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,600
I don't.

969
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,200
Just wondered why
I hadn't seen you,
that's all.

970
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,000
I like you.

971
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,200
I think you're
a fool, mind,

972
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,800
but I like you.

973
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,000
Thanks.

974
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,600
Don't mention it.

975
00:56:58,600 --> 00:56:59,800
Here we are.

976
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:04,800
Tom...

977
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Yes, Judy?

978
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,400
I...

979
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,200
I just wanted
to say...

980
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,200
..thanks for the lift.

981
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,000
That's all right.

982
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,800
Thanks for coming.

983
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,800
That's all right.

984
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,200
Friends?

985
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,200
Friends.

986
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,600
Other Eden, demi-paradise.

987
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:48,800
Precious stone
set in a silvery sea.

988
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,200
This blessed plot,
this earth,

989
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,400
this realm,
this England.

990
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,800
What's all that?

991
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:59,000
Oh, I was just saying
how much I love my country
and the weather.

992
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,400
Winter's all right.

993
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,400
Nice and crisp
and invigorating.

994
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,800
What's wrong
with winter?

995
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,400
Nothing, when
the bath water's hot.

996
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:09,000
Sorry, darling,
it's only every other
day from now on.

997
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,000
Oh, Clem, these cuffs
will never do.

998
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,800
Shall I turn them?
Come in!

999
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,600
Morning, Mother,
morning, Dad.

1000
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:15,600
Morning, Toby.

1001
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,600
Gosh, Dad! That's one
of my handkerchiefs!

1002
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,400
That was one of your
handkerchiefs, Toby.

1003
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,400
It's now performing
a more important
function.

1004
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,600
What's that?

1005
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,000
Keeping your father
warm in a vital part
of his anatomy.

1006
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,600
What happened,
Dad?

1007
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,000
Nothing happened.

1008
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,600
If you must know
the sordid details,

1009
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,000
my collar was frayed.

1010
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Life must go on,
so we operated.

1011
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,400
The tail of my shirt
is the tale of England.

1012
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,400
Here's the post,
Mother.

1013
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,400
There's one for you
from the States.

1014
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,200
Can I have the stamp
after you've read it?

1015
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,600
Thanks awfully!

1016
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,400
You know, darling,

1017
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:57,000
my wardrobe is gradually
becoming nonexistent.

1018
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,600
If somebody doesn't
do something about it
pretty soon,

1019
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:02,600
one of these fine days,
well, I'm just going to
disintegrate.

1020
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:05,400
I'm afraid the only
solution is

1021
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,600
to enter the black
market in a big way.

1022
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:10,800
Trouble is, I haven't
the faintest idea how
to set about it.

1023
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,400
Have you?

1024
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,000
Oh, sorry, darling.

1025
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,200
Who's it from?

1026
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,400
Spike.

1027
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:17,400
Spike?

1028
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,800
The American I met
while you were away.

1029
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:20,800
Ah, yes.

1030
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,800
I've often wondered
about that.

1031
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,600
Have you, dear?

1032
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,400
Of course he fell
in love with you.

1033
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,600
Of course.

1034
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:31,800
Well,
what's the news
from America?

1035
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:34,800
He sent us a food parcel
about a month ago.

1036
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,600
I wonder what's
happened to it.

1037
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:37,800
It takes six weeks.

1038
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,800
Oh, oh, oh,
he's accepted.

1039
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,800
Senor Jose
Antonio Campos

1040
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,400
is coming down
to lunch tomorrow.

1041
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,400
Who?
The man from Brazil.

1042
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,800
Uh, "Tenders
will be invited from
the most vigorous

1043
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,800
"and enterprising
architects of the day."

1044
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,000
Don't you remember?

1045
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,600
Well, I sent in
a few ideas

1046
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,600
and asked him to come
down and feed with us

1047
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:57,400
if he were interested,
and he's coming tomorrow.

1048
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,000
You did what?

1049
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,800
I asked him
to lunch.

1050
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,000
Clem!

1051
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,800
Clem, how could you?

1052
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,600
You know we haven't
enough of anything.

1053
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,000
None of
the plates match,

1054
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,200
I have no
cooking fat.

1055
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,400
That's just
what he wants.

1056
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,800
He asked me to
beg you not to put
on a show for him.

1057
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:14,800
Oh, nonsense.
Listen.

1058
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,400
"Please ask your wife
not to make any
specialities for me.

1059
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,400
"With the English
today,

1060
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:20,800
"it's an honour to eat
bread and cheese."

1061
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:23,200
We can't possibly have
an important man like that

1062
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,600
down to the house
and give him what
we have to eat.

1063
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:26,600
Well, that's
the whole point.

1064
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,200
He wants to see
a typical English meal.

1065
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,400
Well, he may
want to see it,

1066
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,400
he won't want to eat it.
But he does.

1067
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,400
Men like that
are used to Brazil,

1068
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,400
where they have all
those nuts and things.

1069
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,000
He's just being polite.

1070
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,600
Clem, really,
it's too bad.

1071
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,000
You women are
fantastic.

1072
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,800
264, please.

1073
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,600
It's the same thing
every time.

1074
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,400
A foreigner comes
to England,

1075
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,600
having heard tales
of our austerity
and want,

1076
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:54,400
and positively
bursting with sympathy
and understanding,

1077
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,600
and the minute he puts
foot in somebody's door,

1078
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:57,600
what happens?

1079
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:58,800
You women start
a conspiracy.

1080
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:01,000
You beg and you borrow,

1081
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,200
and you scrape together
a full-size meal!

1082
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:05,600
Don't ask me how
you do it or where
it comes from...

1083
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:08,000
Go away.
All I know is the poor,
unsuspecting visitor

1084
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,200
staggers out of
the house,

1085
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,800
his stomach bulging
with four people's rations
for a month,

1086
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:14,000
convinced we're
a nation of hypocrites

1087
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,600
and not half as
badly off as we
say we are.

1088
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,000
I won't sh!

1089
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
The tale spreads
across the ocean.

1090
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,200
Highly delicate
negotiations are
compromised

1091
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,600
and the foreign policy
of the country is
seriously undermined

1092
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:24,800
and it's all your fault!

1093
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,400
Are you listening to me?

1094
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,400
No.

1095
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,600
Hello?

1096
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:30,000
Sophie?

1097
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,600
Oh, Sophie, I'm awfully
sorry to trouble you,

1098
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,600
but Clem has been
perfectly ridiculous

1099
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,800
and invited a complete
stranger down for
lunch tomorrow.

1100
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,400
So I wondered,
could you possibly...

1101
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:47,600
Er, yes, dear,
some marge and lard,

1102
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,400
and er... Oh!

1103
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,000
And, er, oh,
yes, yes.

1104
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,400
And, er, Sophie...

1105
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,200
..the Wedgwood?

1106
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:05,200
Brazil? Do they
play rugger?

1107
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,000
We'll ask them
when we get there.

1108
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,200
If they don't,
we'll make 'em.

1109
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:11,200
Be swell to get
back to America.

1110
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,200
South America.

1111
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,600
North, south,

1112
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:15,800
what's
the difference?

1113
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:18,200
The difference
is considerable.

1114
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,800
But don't worry
about it

1115
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,400
because we shall
probably stay here.

1116
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:26,000
Seems kind of screwy.

1117
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
I mean, we don't
rate any longer.

1118
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,600
We're a vanishing class.

1119
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:31,400
Oh, we are, are we?
Well, who says so?

1120
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,000
Teddy Fathergill.
Who?

1121
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,400
Oh, oh, yes.

1122
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:36,000
You know,
he's a socialist.

1123
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:38,400
But I thought
you were going to
straighten him out.

1124
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,000
Oh, I had
a go at him,

1125
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,600
but he
had a go at me, too.

1126
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,200
He won.

1127
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,200
Bye!

1128
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,200
Bye!

1129
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,000
Judy not down yet?

1130
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,600
No, she was
rather late in,

1131
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:58,200
so I thought I'd
let her sleep on.

1132
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,000
Clem?

1133
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:06,800
Are you serious
about Brazil?

1134
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,600
Thinking about it.

1135
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:09,800
Thinking hard.

1136
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:14,200
Be a big chance for you,
wouldn't it?

1137
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,600
That's
not the point.

1138
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,800
Would you listen
to me for a minute?

1139
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:26,000
I know you can think
of a dozen arguments
for staying put.

1140
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,800
So can I,
if I want to.

1141
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,800
But there's one
tremendous reason
for clearing out.

1142
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,600
You.

1143
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,400
Me?

1144
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,200
Do you really think
you've been fooling me?

1145
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,200
You had quite a war,
Mrs Miniver.

1146
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:45,000
You're having
quite a peace.

1147
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:49,400
Cooking,
washing, scrubbing,
standing in queues,

1148
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,800
hunting for rations,
finding the meals,

1149
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:58,200
reading the headlines
and worrying about Judy,
about Toby, about me.

1150
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,600
No, Clem...

1151
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:02,200
Will you listen to me
for just a minute?

1152
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,600
There are times,
quite a number of times,

1153
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:09,000
when you feel so utterly
and completely tired

1154
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,000
that you could sit
down on the stairs
and cry like a child.

1155
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:18,600
It might be quite
an idea to take you out
of the fish queue.

1156
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:22,200
Give you a nice hot
meal cooked by somebody
else for a change.

1157
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:24,800
Sit you out in the sun
for an hour or two.

1158
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:33,000
So it's...it's all
on my account, this idea?

1159
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,200
No, it's not.

1160
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:36,000
I told you, I want
to get out of Europe.

1161
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,800
And then there's Judy.

1162
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:41,400
Doesn't it occur to you
that to get her away

1163
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:44,200
at this time might
not at all be
a bad notion?

1164
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:46,000
Yes, darling,
I know.

1165
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,600
But there's...

1166
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,400
I'll go.

1167
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:03,600
Hello?

1168
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,200
Uh, yes?

1169
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,400
Yes, no, I'm sorry,

1170
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:08,800
I'm afraid
she's not down yet.

1171
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:10,600
Who?

1172
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,000
Who is speaking,
please?

1173
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,400
Oh, General Brunswick.

1174
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,000
Yes, it is.

1175
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,800
How do you do?

1176
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:22,800
I've, er, I've heard
a lot about you.

1177
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:27,000
Oh, I'm sorry, that wasn't
meant to sound ominous.

1178
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:29,200
Your coat?

1179
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,200
It's quite safe.

1180
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,200
Shall I send it to you,
or will you...?

1181
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,200
Well, I...I'd like
to meet you.

1182
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:41,400
Uh, well, if you
could wait two days,
I could bring it.

1183
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,600
Friday at 12.30?

1184
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:47,200
Well, I'd like that
very much.

1185
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,800
All right, I shall
look forward to it.

1186
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:01,400
'A a few days later,
Kay took the 10.40 to London.

1187
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:06,400
'Judy wanted her mother to know
this man who meant so much to her,

1188
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,800
'and Kay was
determined to meet him.

1189
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:13,400
'Brunswick lived in Westminster,
only 10 minutes from my office.

1190
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:17,600
'I had offered
to return the coat for her,

1191
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:20,000
'but she was adamant.'

1192
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:31,400
Hell's bells!

1193
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,400
Yes?

1194
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:36,600
General Brunswick?

1195
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,400
Good grief!
Are you Mrs Miniver?

1196
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:40,800
Kay Miniver, yes.

1197
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:42,800
Good grief.

1198
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,600
You're a surprise.

1199
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,400
A pleasant one?

1200
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:48,600
Decidedly.

1201
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:51,000
That daughter of
yours never told me.

1202
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,200
You're a lot younger
than I thought.

1203
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:54,800
What were you expecting?

1204
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,200
Oh, I pictured
something nondescript,
middle-aged.

1205
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,400
You're quite a beautiful
woman, in your way.

1206
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:03,000
Not really.
This is one of
my good days.

1207
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,800
Here's the coat.

1208
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,200
Oh, thanks very much.

1209
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:08,800
I've got foul manners.
What are we standing
here for?

1210
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,000
Come in and have
a drink.

1211
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,800
Thank you.

1212
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:13,200
I'd like a drink.

1213
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:16,600
Ignore the chaos,
I'm on my way out.

1214
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:17,800
Today?

1215
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,000
No, tomorrow.

1216
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,400
This is my
wife's flat, really.

1217
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:24,000
She gets back from
Canada Sunday night.

1218
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,200
Your wife?

1219
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:26,200
Pamela Lyndon.

1220
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,200
Yes, yes, of course.

1221
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,600
Do you like good
music or jazz?

1222
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:33,200
Uh, both.

1223
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,800
Ever hear her?

1224
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:37,200
I heard your wife
give a Greek concerto

1225
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,600
a week before
the war began.

1226
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:40,800
First-class
pianist, Pam.

1227
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:42,800
Magnificent woman
in many ways.

1228
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,400
Impossible to live with.

1229
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,200
Sherry?
Thank you.

1230
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:49,400
Women are impossible for
the most part, you know?

1231
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,800
They get a bee in their
bonnet about something

1232
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,000
and they won't
let it drop.

1233
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
They will go on and on.

1234
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,200
I must say,
you don't look as if
you'd go on and on.

1235
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:00,400
But you probably do,
if the truth were known.

1236
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:01,400
I'm worse than most.

1237
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:02,800
Sit down.

1238
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:09,600
Good grief,
you're young to have
a girl like Judy.

1239
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:11,600
I suppose everyone
says that.

1240
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:13,400
Uh, it has been
said before.

1241
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,400
But I never tire
of hearing it.

1242
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:16,800
Cheers.
Cheers.

1243
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:22,000
Do you fight a lot
in your family?

1244
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,000
Or is
everything placid
and respectable?

1245
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:28,000
Oh, we tear
each other to pieces

1246
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,600
all day long
and half the night.

1247
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,000
Hasn't Judy told you?

1248
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
No, she hasn't
said much.

1249
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,600
To be honest,
she hasn't had
much chance.

1250
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,400
When we're together,
I talk most of the time.

1251
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:39,000
What do you talk about?

1252
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,800
Oh, life, love,
the world in general.

1253
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:45,800
The world's in a mess,
did you know that?

1254
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:49,200
I had heard something.

1255
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:52,200
Hmm. You look reasonably
intelligent for a woman.

1256
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,600
Why haven't
we met before? >

1257
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,000
It wasn't my doing.

1258
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,400
You steered clear of us.

1259
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:00,600
Thought it was best,
considering.

1260
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:03,800
You probably hate
my guts, don't you?

1261
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:09,600
I haven't had time
to hate you yet.

1262
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,400
You'll get around
to it.

1263
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:16,200
I'm starting
the divorce as soon
as Pam gets back.

1264
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:18,600
Or rather
she's starting it.
She cabled yesterday.

1265
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:21,600
It'll take some time,
of course.

1266
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:22,600
As soon as
it's through,

1267
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:24,000
I'll marry
your daughter.

1268
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,400
Probably won't last,
but I'll marry her.

1269
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:29,200
Time.

1270
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:31,800
How much time?

1271
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,200
A year, 18 months.

1272
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:38,400
There's a queue
of people waiting
to get separated.

1273
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
You don't like that,
do you?

1274
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,200
You want to see your
chick settled.

1275
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,400
Every mother wants that.

1276
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,200
But you're in a hurry.

1277
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:52,800
How do you know?

1278
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:55,000
I know women
and I read faces.

1279
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,200
It was my job
in the war,

1280
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:59,600
to guess the other
chap's move and beat
him to it.

1281
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:03,000
Why are you in a hurry,
Mrs Miniver? >

1282
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,600
You must be a very
difficult man to live with.

1283
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,200
Oh, quite impossible.

1284
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,600
I warned Judy,
but she just laughed.

1285
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,400
She thinks I'm worth it.

1286
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:12,800
Are you?

1287
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,200
No.

1288
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,400
She's very much
in love with you.

1289
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:22,000
And now that
I've met you,

1290
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,400
I'm beginning
to understand why.

1291
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:25,600
Are you?

1292
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,600
Well, I can't.

1293
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,600
I thank my
stars for it,

1294
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,200
but I can't think
what she sees in me.

1295
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:34,000
You're...different.

1296
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:37,200
You're blunt,
almost rude.

1297
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,000
You're honest.

1298
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:40,600
That's rare.

1299
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:43,600
And you're rather
dashing and glamorous.

1300
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:44,800
Oh, nonsense.

1301
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,000
Oh, yes, that's
your reputation,

1302
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:49,200
you have a name for
bold deeds and wild adventures.

1303
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:51,600
You fire the imagination.

1304
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:55,000
Oh, yes, I can see
what Judy sees in you.

1305
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Matter of fact,
if I were her age,
I might...

1306
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,400
You might?

1307
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,600
That was very good sherry.
May I have some more?

1308
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:05,200
Have the whole
bottle!

1309
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:07,200
Let's get tight.

1310
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:09,400
I never get tight
before lunch.

1311
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:13,000
Let's have lunch
together and get
tight afterwards.

1312
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,800
I'm a menace,
Mrs Miniver.

1313
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:21,600
I love Judy,
I love her youth,
her freshness,

1314
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:22,800
her naivete.

1315
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,800
Her belief in
all the things that
I no longer believe in.

1316
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:31,600
But I'll probably make
her a shocking husband,

1317
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,200
just as I did Pam.

1318
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,200
Not that that was
altogether my fault.

1319
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:37,400
We used to throw things
at each other, you know.

1320
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:39,200
What sort of things?

1321
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,200
Oh, anything
that was handy.

1322
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:44,200
Ornaments, books,
gramophone records.

1323
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,000
You have got a few
of them left.

1324
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,400
Are you saving
those for Judy?

1325
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:49,600
Ha! I hope it won't
come to that.

1326
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:51,200
Not yet, anyway.

1327
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:55,600
Peace and quiet
for a time.

1328
01:11:55,600 --> 01:12:00,600
Yes, but you're not
a man of peace, are you?

1329
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:03,200
I mean, you've
no peace inside you.

1330
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:05,600
That's why you're always
fighting other people.

1331
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,400
< You're really
fighting yourself.

1332
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:10,200
You really are
an unusual woman.

1333
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,800
Well, you're right,
of course.

1334
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,400
I've no peace inside.

1335
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,400
That's why I
make a soldier.

1336
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,600
I don't give
two straws if I die.

1337
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:21,400
Oh, death can be easy.

1338
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:24,000
It's living
that's difficult.

1339
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,600
That's been said
before, too.

1340
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,200
It's still true.

1341
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:31,600
What did you fight about?

1342
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,800
You and your wife.

1343
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Oh, please don't
think that I'm just

1344
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
interfering or
digging up the past,

1345
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,800
it's only that I'd like
to be able to warn Judy

1346
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:44,800
about the dangerous
topics so that she can
keep off them.

1347
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,000
Or perhaps she does keep
off them automatically.

1348
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,200
Does she?

1349
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:49,800
As a matter of fact,
she does.

1350
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,800
That's because she doesn't
know anything about them.

1351
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
She's just a baby.

1352
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:57,800
No, Pam and I used to fight
about the maddest things.

1353
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:00,400
Small things blown
up into large ones?

1354
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:01,800
No, large ones.

1355
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
I thought I knew
all about music.

1356
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,200
She thought she was an
expert on world affairs.

1357
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:08,600
Who was right?

1358
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:10,000
Both of us.

1359
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,200
Always.

1360
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:13,200
That's what made the whole
thing so impossible.

1361
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:16,400
She has a first-class
brain, Pam.

1362
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,800
And a wide
catholic taste.

1363
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,000
Her mind's as nimble
as her fingers.

1364
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:24,200
But she's
the most infernally
obstinate woman

1365
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,600
I ever met
in my life.

1366
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,800
She's quite beautiful,
isn't she?

1367
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:29,400
The loveliest
person.

1368
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:33,400
But of all the
obstinate, idiotic,
pig-headed females!

1369
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:35,400
You talked about
the Greek,

1370
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:38,000
my Harry, the row
we had about that!

1371
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,000
You remember
that cadenza in
the first movement. Here.

1372
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
The one that
goes like this.

1373
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,600
Lovely thing, isn't it?

1374
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,200
You remember the theme?

1375
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,800
That's the way
it should be played.

1376
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:41,800
The way it was written.

1377
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:43,400
But that's not
good enough for Pam.

1378
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,200
She has to
play it like this.

1379
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:06,600
Now listen,
listen to this!

1380
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:11,600
See what I mean?

1381
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,800
I'm afraid I don't.

1382
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:16,800
They both sound
the same to me.

1383
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:19,800
All right!
You don't have to
know the difference.

1384
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:21,000
You're just a...

1385
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
But Pam's an artist
and a brilliant one,

1386
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:24,800
and to play the thing
that way!

1387
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:28,000
She adores Scriabine
and Pergolesi.

1388
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,800
I loathe Scriabine
and Pergolesi.

1389
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,800
And her taste
in painting,

1390
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,000
I ask you.

1391
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,600
Raoul Mati.

1392
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,400
Obscure French painter.

1393
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:40,600
Picasso school.

1394
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,600
Trash!

1395
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,400
We paid 40 quid
for that.

1396
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:47,400
The second best art
critic in town offered
me 400 for it last week.

1397
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,800
I still say it's trash.

1398
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,600
These things are important
to you, aren't they?

1399
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:56,000
Music and painting?

1400
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:58,200
Of course
they're important!

1401
01:15:58,200 --> 01:15:59,800
There's nothing
else left.

1402
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:03,800
Then they're worth
arguing and fighting about.

1403
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:08,600
I mean, if you're lucky
enough to find somebody

1404
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:10,400
who knows about them,

1405
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,800
who feels as strongly
about them as you do,

1406
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:17,400
even if that person doesn't
always agree with you.

1407
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:20,600
Yes, it was exciting
being married to Pam.

1408
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:24,400
Never dull,
I'll say that for it.

1409
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:30,200
Well, I don't think
you'll have any
trouble with Judy.

1410
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:32,800
In fact,
I'm sure you won't.

1411
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:36,600
As you say, she doesn't
know the first thing

1412
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,800
about any of these things
you've been talking about.

1413
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,200
I don't mean that
she doesn't like
music and painting,

1414
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:45,600
but, well, you know,
we're just an average family.

1415
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:49,000
We like a painting
to tell a good story.

1416
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Or music to have
a good tune.

1417
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,200
Something nice and simple.

1418
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:58,200
So you see,
I'm afraid you will

1419
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:01,400
have to come down
to her level, won't you?

1420
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:04,800
Because she certainly
won't be able to
climb up to yours.

1421
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:08,200
Well...

1422
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:10,600
goodbye, General.

1423
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:13,800
It's been a fascinating
quarter of an hour.

1424
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:25,200
Shall I give
your love to Judy?

1425
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,200
Yes, thank you.

1426
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,800
Thank you very,
very much indeed.

1427
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:26,000
Hello, Janet.

1428
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Mrs Miniver.

1429
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Oh, he's gone
to lunch.

1430
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:32,000
Just this minute,
I'm so sorry.

1431
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:33,400
Perhaps I can
catch him.

1432
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:35,200
Oh, no, don't bother.
He's not expecting me.

1433
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:36,400
It's a surprise visit.

1434
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:38,200
He left early today.

1435
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,200
He's taken the
passports, you know,

1436
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:41,400
to the passport
office.

1437
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:44,800
Oh, then we're going?

1438
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
I envy you.

1439
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:49,600
Janet, tell me truthfully,
is he doing this for me?

1440
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:52,800
Well, he thinks
you need a change.

1441
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:56,200
Most people do,
but they seem to manage
without one.

1442
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,400
You don't
want to go?

1443
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:04,200
No, no, I don't.

1444
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:07,800
It's so far away
from home and...

1445
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:09,800
I'd rather...

1446
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
I'd rather live here.

1447
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:14,600
If you don't want it,
Mrs Miniver,

1448
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,400
I think you
should say so.

1449
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,400
I mean, tell him
the reason.

1450
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,400
Whatever it is.

1451
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:21,600
I can't do that.

1452
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:23,800
That's the one thing
that...

1453
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:27,600
Besides, it isn't
just for me.

1454
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:31,600
He has a kind of
desperate yearning

1455
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,800
to get away from this
part of the world.

1456
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:37,000
Oh, that? That's just
the view from that window.

1457
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:38,600
View from the...

1458
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,400
Yes, I know
it sounds silly,

1459
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:43,400
a little thing like
that affecting a man,
but it does.

1460
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:44,600
I'm sure it does.

1461
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:47,200
He comes in quite
cheerful and bright
in the morning,

1462
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:48,800
then he sits down
over there,

1463
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,400
and within
about 10 minutes,

1464
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:53,200
he sort of glooms over,
if you know what I mean.

1465
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:56,400
Of course we could
look for another office,
I suppose,

1466
01:19:56,400 --> 01:20:00,000
but I don't think he'd
fancy the idea of moving.

1467
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,400
Why, even when
Mr Blakner retired,

1468
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,000
he wouldn't move.

1469
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,400
Janet.

1470
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:09,200
Mrs Miniver.

1471
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:18,800
It's all right,
lady, it's a pleasure.

1472
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:19,800
Thank you,
lady, much oblige.

1473
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:24,000
Ten bob each, OK?

1474
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,200
All right with me.

1475
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,800
How much did
you get for it?

1476
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:12,400
Old Blakie's office.

1477
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,600
Well, it was just
an old junk room.

1478
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:17,600
You're not angry,
are you?

1479
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:20,600
I don't know.
I don't think so.

1480
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:22,600
I've hardly
had time to...

1481
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:27,000
Hello. When
did these come?

1482
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:28,200
While you were out.

1483
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:30,200
Are they good?

1484
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:34,200
Are they good, Clem?

1485
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:38,000
Yes. They're
first class.

1486
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:41,200
Somebody trying
to put me out
of business?

1487
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:44,000
No. Somebody wants
to come into the business.

1488
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,600
Who did them?

1489
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,600
You've been plotting.
The Foley boy, these are
his, aren't they?

1490
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,000
But they're good, Clem,
you just said so.

1491
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:55,400
You can't
take that back.

1492
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:56,600
I'm not taking
it back.

1493
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:58,200
No, well, don't try to.

1494
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:01,000
Look, I can't take
on an apprentice just
as we're leaving.

1495
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:03,400
We'll be out
of the country
within a month.

1496
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:09,000
Good heavens, woman,
if you loathe the idea
so much, say so.

1497
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,000
You want to get out,
don't you?

1498
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,800
Yes, I do, I do. The more
I sit here day after day
looking out at that...

1499
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:27,800
If you want to go,
we'll go, darling.

1500
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:31,800
Hey, come back here.
I want to talk to you.

1501
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:33,800
No, not now.
Tonight at the dance.

1502
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:36,600
Dance?
The sailing club dance.
Don't be late.

1503
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:56,800
Judy?

1504
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:10,600
Judy?

1505
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:15,800
Darling, turn around.
I have something
to show you.

1506
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:18,400
Judy, it's for you
for tonight.

1507
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,600
No, thanks.
I'm not going.

1508
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,400
Not going?

1509
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,200
Darling, what is it?
Aren't you well?

1510
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:27,600
Please don't touch me.

1511
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:28,600
Judy.

1512
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:31,800
Why? Why did you have
to interfere?

1513
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,200
It has nothing
to do with you.

1514
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:36,400
I loved him, he loved me.
We'd have been married
but for you.

1515
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:37,600
But for me?

1516
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,200
Oh, don't pretend,
please, don't pretend.

1517
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:42,000
You were there today.
You went to see him.

1518
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:44,800
Yes, of course
I went to see him.
You knew that.

1519
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:47,800
I told you I was going.
I went to take
his coat back.

1520
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:49,000
That was just an excuse.

1521
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:53,400
Yes, just an excuse
to see him, but not
to make you unhappy.

1522
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:56,600
You've hated
the idea of Steve from
the very beginning.

1523
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:59,200
I never hated Steve.
I liked him.

1524
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:01,800
He asked me in
and we talked.

1525
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:03,600
And broke it off.

1526
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:04,800
Darling.

1527
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,600
Please, don't
come near me.

1528
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:10,000
I don't know what
you said to him.
I don't care.

1529
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:13,000
I only know
that yesterday
everything was gay

1530
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
and sweet
and rather lovely.

1531
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,200
And now it's over.

1532
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:21,600
Finished.
Oh, how could you?

1533
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:23,400
How could you?

1534
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:26,800
Oh, Judy.

1535
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:29,400
Oh, darling.

1536
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:36,600
I didn't try to talk
Steve out of loving you.

1537
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:40,000
I couldn't have, even
if I'd wanted to.

1538
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,400
Darling, he loved you.

1539
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:48,200
He still loves you, my baby.
How could he help it?

1540
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:52,600
But I'm afraid
he loves his wife more.

1541
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:56,000
That wasn't true.
Not till today.

1542
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,400
I think it was true
all the time.

1543
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:06,600
He lost sight of her in
the war partly because
he found you in the war.

1544
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:09,200
But the war
is over, Judy.

1545
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:13,000
"The war, the war."
Everybody blames
everything on the war.

1546
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:14,400
That's such a cliche.

1547
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,600
A lot of cliches are true.

1548
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:18,400
Well, I don't
believe that one.

1549
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:26,000
I do because I happen
to know that it's true.

1550
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:32,600
A lot of friendships
spring up out of a war.

1551
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:36,800
And they die
when peace comes.

1552
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:40,600
And it's right
that they should.

1553
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,800
What do you know
about it?

1554
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:10,200
I'd like
to read you a letter.

1555
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:12,000
It came two days ago.

1556
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
It's from an American.

1557
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:18,200
We had an awful
lot of war together.

1558
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:34,000
"My dearest Kay, this is
the first time I've ever written
to you with Ellen in the room."

1559
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Ellen is his wife.

1560
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:41,200
"Kay, you remember our
last evening together?

1561
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:47,400
"Remember you said, you'll
get the war out of your
system sooner than you think.

1562
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:51,800
"And when it's gone,
I'll be gone, too.

1563
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,200
"I didn't believe you then.

1564
01:26:55,400 --> 01:27:00,200
"I've been home now several
months and all that time
I haven't believed you.

1565
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:05,200
"Because all that time,
it hasn't been true.

1566
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:12,200
"But now, quite suddenly,
it is true, Kay.

1567
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:14,400
"I'm home again with Ellen.

1568
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:19,800
"Really home.
Home in my heart.

1569
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:26,000
"Dear Kay, I know
you never cared for me
the way I cared for you.

1570
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:33,600
"It was all on my side,
so this won't be a hurt
but a happiness.

1571
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:39,200
"I love Ellen now as much as
I loved her before I met you.

1572
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:44,800
"Maybe a little more
because I did meet you...

1573
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:47,200
"and love you.

1574
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:54,800
"Goodbye, Kay,
my dearest Kay.

1575
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,800
"You were there
when I needed you.

1576
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:04,200
"I don't need you any more.
I'll never forget.

1577
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:11,000
"I shan't try to now because
now there's no danger
in remembering.

1578
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:19,800
"God bless you,
always. Spike."

1579
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:33,800
That's why I know.

1580
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:39,800
I know what Steve felt for you,
what he still feels for you.

1581
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:45,600
It could happen and still not
touch his love for his wife.

1582
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:50,800
Spike never knew.

1583
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:54,600
Never. And never will.

1584
01:28:56,600 --> 01:29:00,400
No-one will ever except you.

1585
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:04,000
Will they, Judy?

1586
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:06,000
Nobody!

1587
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,800
Where is everybody?

1588
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:12,000
What's this, a hen party?

1589
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,400
This is just
idle gossip, mother
and daughter stuff.

1590
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:16,200
Well, come on now, jump
to it or we'll be late.

1591
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:18,600
I promised Mrs Foley
the first rhumba.

1592
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:21,400
Second for you, Kay,
and third for Judy.
That in order?

1593
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:23,400
Well, er, Judy's going to bed.
She's got a headache.

1594
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:26,400
I think I'll come after all,
if you don't mind.

1595
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:27,600
Mind?

1596
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,200
Well, don't sit
there messing about.

1597
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:31,000
Come on. Somebody's got
to tie my tie for me.

1598
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,400
Hurry up, girls.

1599
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:10,800
You know, there's
something about a well-cut
jacket you just can't mistake.

1600
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,200
I was afraid the moths
might have got into it.

1601
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:15,400
New dress, isn't
it, darling?

1602
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:17,600
Oh, Clem.
It's six years old.

1603
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:19,800
It can't be. Rationing
hasn't been in that long.

1604
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:22,000
Well, I wasn't entirely
naked when it started.

1605
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,800
I'd thought for
a moment you might
have stolen my coupons.

1606
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:27,000
I did. And there's
where they went.

1607
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,800
And five of mine
for the shoes.

1608
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,400
Evening,
Mrs M. Evening, Mr M.

1609
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:38,000
How about
a sardine sandwich?

1610
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,200
Mr And Mrs M, Mother.

1611
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:42,000
Mrs Foley.
Hello, Tom.

1612
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:43,800
What a lovely
dance, Mr Foley.

1613
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:45,800
And the food.
How did you manage it?

1614
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,600
I suppose
we'll all suffer for
this next week.

1615
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:52,400
Half a dollop of marge
instead of the usual
two mouthfuls.

1616
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:55,000
Oh, no, nothing like that.
Things are looking up.

1617
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,400
Everything will be back
to normal any day now.

1618
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:00,200
He's been
saying that every day
since peace was declared.

1619
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:02,400
Well, there's no harm in
hoping, Mother, is there?

1620
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:04,400
She misses the bombs.

1621
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:06,400
Well, at least they made
you feel you were alive.

1622
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:10,200
Oh, Tom,
I've got something
for you in the car.

1623
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:11,400
Don't let me go off
with it, will you?

1624
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:12,600
Something for
me, sir?

1625
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:13,800
Yes, your sketches.

1626
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:16,400
What did you
think of them, sir?

1627
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:19,800
Well, I think that
probably you'll put me
out of business.

1628
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:21,200
That is, if I don't
take you into it.

1629
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:23,400
How about it? Do you think
you can spare him, Foley?

1630
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:27,600
Aren't you leaving us?
I heard you were bound
for foreign parts.

1631
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:29,800
You mean you want
to take Tom with you?

1632
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:34,200
Yes. I want Tom
to come with me, but
only as far as London.

1633
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:37,400
Do you think you
can manage that?
Trains run every half-hour.

1634
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:40,000
Then Brazil is off?
Hello, darling.

1635
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Oh, Clem.

1636
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,600
Did you say
something, dear?

1637
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:50,800
Monday morning, 10.30.

1638
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:52,400
9.30, sir.

1639
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:53,600
I'll tell you how
to get to the office.

1640
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:55,000
I'll tell him, Father.

1641
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,200
You've only been there
once in your life.

1642
01:31:57,200 --> 01:31:58,800
I'll tell him.

1643
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Mother.

1644
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:19,800
Don't forget our rhumba.

1645
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,400
Happy
about everything?

1646
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:33,200
Completely happy.

1647
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:34,600
Dance with me?

1648
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:41,400
Kay?

1649
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:43,400
Yes?

1650
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:44,800
Where are you?

1651
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,400
I'm here.

1652
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:49,200
But you look miles away.

1653
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:51,200
Come back, will you?

1654
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,400
I'm here, darling.

1655
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:58,800
I was just thinking.

1656
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:02,400
I have to tell
you something.

1657
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:03,600
Now?

1658
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:06,800
Yes, Clem, now.

1659
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:10,200
It's hot in here.
Let's go outside.

1660
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:11,200
All right, darling.

1661
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Our ninth anniversary.

1662
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Tenth. '18 to '28,
10 years.

1663
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:39,800
'18 to '46?

1664
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:42,400
28 years.

1665
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:50,600
'46 to '56
to '66 to '76.

1666
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:53,600
We'll be like
old man river.

1667
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:56,600
We'll just keep
rolling along.

1668
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:04,400
Clem, you don't mind
about Brazil?

1669
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:06,800
I belong here.

1670
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:08,800
We both do.

1671
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:12,800
Then you'll stay
here? Always now?

1672
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:14,800
Of course. If
that's what you want.

1673
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:18,600
We might slip away to
the sea for a fortnight
in the summer.

1674
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:19,800
What do you think?

1675
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:22,800
Yes.

1676
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:28,000
As long as
we're home by autumn.

1677
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:32,600
I want to be home
for autumn, Clem.

1678
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:35,000
It's important.

1679
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:41,000
Why is it important
to be home for the
autumn, Mrs Miniver?

1680
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:49,400
Because next to the spring
it's the loveliest time
of the year.

1681
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:53,800
And I...

1682
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:58,800
I won't be here
for the spring.

1683
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:06,800
What does
that mean, exactly?

1684
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:12,800
My darling,
my darling husband.

1685
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:19,400
'She gripped
my hands, gripped them tight
till it hurt.

1686
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:28,000
'And then, she told me,
while the music played
and the moon shone,

1687
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:32,400
'and old man river,
he just went rolling along.

1688
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:40,600
'Kay told me that night
that when the autumn was gone,
she'd be gone, too.

1689
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:46,800
'I heard her voice,
I knew what she was saying.

1690
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:53,000
'But standing there I seemed
more aware of absurd,
irrelevant things -

1691
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:56,800
'an owl hooting on
the other side of the water,

1692
01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:02,000
'somewhere inside on the dance
floor, the tinkle of glass,

1693
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:07,600
'one of the little fairy lanterns
overhead flickering on and off.

1694
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:14,800
'She stopped speaking and
looked up at me, waiting.

1695
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:25,800
'I felt a touch on my sleeve
and then her voice.'

1696
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:28,200
The last dance, Clem.

1697
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:42,600
'Somehow, I found my feet

1698
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:45,400
'moving automatically
back onto the floor.

1699
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:52,400
'I remember thinking,
"They're playing that thing
from Annie, Get Your Gun."

1700
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:57,200
'Strange how music
bridges the years.

1701
01:36:57,200 --> 01:37:01,000
'Showboat and Annie, Get Your Gun.

1702
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:04,000
'20 years of married life.

1703
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:15,200
'And so we danced.
We didn't speak. Not a word.

1704
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:17,600
'What was there to say?

1705
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:20,200
'We just looked at each other.

1706
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,800
'And loved each other.

1707
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,200
'And danced.'

1708
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:51,200
Clem.

1709
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:17,800
I won't
let it happen.

1710
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:19,200
It shan't.

1711
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:22,200
We'll find something,
somewhere.

1712
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:23,800
We'll go on
till we do.

1713
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
There's America,
the whole world.

1714
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,600
We'll go all over
the world to the ends
of the earth.

1715
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:32,000
I know there's
something!

1716
01:38:32,200 --> 01:38:34,200
I've seen everyone.

1717
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:37,400
The best.
The very best.

1718
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:41,600
But there must be something,
something we can do.

1719
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:45,400
There isn't, my dearest.
There isn't.

1720
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:47,600
I didn't tell you
until I knew.

1721
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:50,200
There's nothing
that anyone...

1722
01:38:50,200 --> 01:38:56,200
They say that it was
the war, and then after.

1723
01:38:56,200 --> 01:39:01,600
You have to be pretty
tough these days,

1724
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:06,800
and I wasn't quite
tough enough.

1725
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:13,600
You know.
You do know, don't you?

1726
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:18,800
How much I...
I've loved you?

1727
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,600
Darling, I know.

1728
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:30,600
We've had one of the rarest
things in the world,

1729
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:33,600
a perfect marriage.

1730
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:37,200
Nothing has touched it

1731
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:43,200
and nothing
can break it, ever.

1732
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:48,200

1754
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:18,200
Well, Charles.
Thank you once again.
You did us proud.

1755
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:20,000
They're
a charming couple.

1756
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:21,800
They go
well together.

1757
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:24,000
So, by the way,
do you.

1758
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:29,200
The first leaves.

1759
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:34,800
You know, I often think
that England is like
a certain type of woman,

1760
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:37,200
at her loveliest
in the autumn.

1761
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,400
Goodbye, Mrs Miniver.

and we walked back
together into the house,

'I realised Kay had never
looked more beautiful.'

1765
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:12,000
I think it all
went off rather nicely,
don't you, darling?

1766
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:16,200
I'm so glad it was
fine for them.

1767
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:23,000
It's been a beautiful
day, Clem.

1768
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:26,400
Something to remember.

1769
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,800
I'll be down in a moment.

1770
