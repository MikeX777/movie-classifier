1
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:37,791
HALFWAY

2
00:02:20,127 --> 00:02:24,405
I think I'll get a divorce too.
What a house!

3
00:02:25,007 --> 00:02:26,566
What's that?

4
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:29,204
Stef, what's that?

5
00:02:30,007 --> 00:02:31,122
Unbelievable.

6
00:02:36,487 --> 00:02:37,636
Put it around your head.

7
00:02:37,727 --> 00:02:40,606
Come on, man.
-No, that's safer.

8
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:46,558
Lots of happiness in your new house.
Ellen from Immo Castelyns Real Estate.

9
00:02:46,887 --> 00:02:47,877
Nice.

10
00:02:53,447 --> 00:02:55,643
Man, this is huge.

11
00:02:55,727 --> 00:02:59,436
You could organise some good
parties here.

12
00:03:15,727 --> 00:03:17,559
Did you call us, Master?

13
00:03:17,647 --> 00:03:18,796
Are there glasses?

14
00:03:18,887 --> 00:03:20,844
The coolbox, in my car.

15
00:03:28,887 --> 00:03:30,036
Your furniture has arrived.

16
00:03:38,247 --> 00:03:39,646
Here?
-Yes.

17
00:03:48,207 --> 00:03:51,040
I'm going to have a drink.

18
00:03:51,527 --> 00:03:53,757
Come on, guys.

19
00:04:07,567 --> 00:04:08,602
Stef...

20
00:04:08,847 --> 00:04:10,963
Stef, where should the bed go?

21
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,156
Is this alright?

22
00:04:20,647 --> 00:04:22,445
What will you do with all that
space?

23
00:04:22,727 --> 00:04:25,003
Or do you want to play the macho for
Natalie?

24
00:04:25,527 --> 00:04:27,006
My office is here too.

25
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,843
You won't continue to work for
her father?

26
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:31,477
No.

27
00:04:32,367 --> 00:04:34,404
Will you leave some for the men
downstairs?

28
00:04:35,687 --> 00:04:38,679
They're getting paid, we're not.

29
00:04:38,767 --> 00:04:40,758
Yes, that's true.
-No, seriously.

30
00:05:14,487 --> 00:05:17,240
What are you doing?

31
00:05:17,327 --> 00:05:19,318
I didn't push it.

32
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,605
A target shot.

33
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:50,557
OK.

34
00:05:50,727 --> 00:05:51,717
Thanks.

35
00:05:55,847 --> 00:05:58,077
Here you go.
-This is for you.

36
00:05:58,167 --> 00:05:59,202
There's no need.

37
00:05:59,647 --> 00:06:01,957
For dealing with those two clowns.

38
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,966
That's not enough.

39
00:06:08,047 --> 00:06:10,516
Join us for a drink?

40
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:13,636
No, I'll continue unpacking.

41
00:06:17,327 --> 00:06:19,716
Will your Rebecca drop by?
-No.

42
00:06:20,007 --> 00:06:22,317
She's not my Rebecca.

43
00:09:13,927 --> 00:09:15,326
Fuck.

44
00:09:37,767 --> 00:09:39,678
Boozers.

45
00:09:40,407 --> 00:09:42,683
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

46
00:09:51,687 --> 00:09:52,677
I live here.

47
00:09:53,087 --> 00:09:56,364
I think you're mistaken.
I just bought this house.

48
00:09:58,367 --> 00:09:59,846
Do you have a woman?

49
00:09:59,927 --> 00:10:04,444
I don't know you and I didn't invite you.
Get out of my house.

50
00:10:04,567 --> 00:10:05,966
Children?

51
00:10:07,127 --> 00:10:11,564
None of your business and I'm not
playing your games. Get lost...

52
00:10:11,647 --> 00:10:13,081
or I'll call the police.

53
00:10:15,607 --> 00:10:17,803
Can I make a call?

54
00:10:18,247 --> 00:10:21,603
No, can you call for me?
I'll tell you what to say.

55
00:10:22,007 --> 00:10:23,122
As you wish, pal.

56
00:10:24,927 --> 00:10:27,396
I'm only asking you to help me.
-Yes.

57
00:10:28,767 --> 00:10:30,883
Hello, Inspector.
Aelterman speaking.

58
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,560
I just bought the house at
14 Leeuweriklaan.

59
00:10:36,447 --> 00:10:40,441
A bum broke into my house and he's
refusing to leave.

60
00:10:41,127 --> 00:10:42,322
No, I don't know him.

61
00:10:42,527 --> 00:10:43,642
Never saw him before.

62
00:10:43,887 --> 00:10:44,877
Yes, thank you.

63
00:10:45,007 --> 00:10:46,156
14 Leeuweriklaan.

64
00:10:47,727 --> 00:10:49,365
They're coming.

65
00:10:50,007 --> 00:10:52,999
Leave if you don't want any
problems.

66
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:57,400
Do you always react like this when
people ask you to help them?

67
00:10:57,527 --> 00:10:58,517
Help?

68
00:10:58,647 --> 00:11:02,925
You say help but you mean money.
Do you want money to leave?

69
00:11:03,167 --> 00:11:04,646
Who mentioned money?

70
00:11:06,447 --> 00:11:09,565
I only asked for one phone call.
-Are you threatening me now?

71
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:12,840
Are you threatening me?
-Damnit.

72
00:11:13,167 --> 00:11:15,841
You're a hopeless case, you know?

73
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:18,157
The cops are here already.

74
00:11:32,007 --> 00:11:34,886
You called us?
-Yes, he's in the room.

75
00:11:39,327 --> 00:11:41,045
He took off, of course.

76
00:11:51,527 --> 00:11:52,926
You don't know who it is?

77
00:11:53,007 --> 00:11:56,762
No, he said he lives here.
A squatter maybe?

78
00:11:57,327 --> 00:11:59,238
The house has been empty for
a long time.

79
00:12:00,407 --> 00:12:01,397
Yes.

80
00:12:05,127 --> 00:12:06,959
Do you want us to have a look
around?

81
00:12:07,407 --> 00:12:09,683
To make sure he's gone.

82
00:12:10,207 --> 00:12:11,197
Yes.

83
00:12:33,207 --> 00:12:36,916
Can you describe him?
Maybe he's a regular of ours.

84
00:12:39,527 --> 00:12:41,484
A man, around 40.

85
00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:42,557
I think.

86
00:12:43,967 --> 00:12:45,116
6 feet tall.

87
00:12:46,367 --> 00:12:48,677
Only shorts and a towel.

88
00:12:50,607 --> 00:12:52,325
As if he came out of the shower.

89
00:12:53,727 --> 00:12:54,717
Reddish hair.

90
00:12:55,287 --> 00:12:58,439
Did he threaten you in any way?

91
00:12:59,607 --> 00:13:01,006
I'm just irritated.

92
00:13:01,607 --> 00:13:03,837
Sorry about the mess.
I just moved.

93
00:13:04,247 --> 00:13:05,237
And I'm divorcing.

94
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,959
As you said, he left when he
heard us.

95
00:13:11,087 --> 00:13:14,045
We're checking the neighbourhood.
Maybe he's there somewhere.

96
00:13:15,847 --> 00:13:16,837
Yes.

97
00:13:44,007 --> 00:13:44,997
Hey, Rebecca.

98
00:13:45,327 --> 00:13:47,796
Come see my new office.

99
00:13:48,087 --> 00:13:49,805
I'll be there all day tomorrow.

100
00:13:51,167 --> 00:13:53,397
I didn't touch anything.
-Bloody hell!

101
00:13:56,447 --> 00:14:00,486
Aelterman speaking. Send someone again.
The bum's back.

102
00:14:01,287 --> 00:14:02,516
He's standing in front of me.

103
00:14:04,087 --> 00:14:05,077
Thank you.

104
00:14:05,487 --> 00:14:07,922
Stop calling me a bum.

105
00:14:08,287 --> 00:14:11,564
I don't call you a selfish asshole
either, do I?

106
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:23,117
Perfect.

107
00:14:29,047 --> 00:14:30,720
One in the cosy corner maybe?

108
00:14:31,487 --> 00:14:33,524
If it's not too much trouble.

109
00:14:39,207 --> 00:14:40,197
Right.

110
00:14:41,567 --> 00:14:43,797
A bit like the lord of the manor.

111
00:14:44,407 --> 00:14:46,284
Which is what I am.

112
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,486
You'll be gone tomorrow.

113
00:14:50,847 --> 00:14:51,917
I bet.

114
00:14:53,487 --> 00:14:54,716
Another one. Thanks.

115
00:14:55,647 --> 00:14:58,844
It's not hard to do someone
a favour.

116
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:00,557
Come in.

117
00:15:02,207 --> 00:15:03,197
He's back.

118
00:15:07,887 --> 00:15:10,003
Yes, that was to be expected.

119
00:15:10,287 --> 00:15:13,200
Of course he took off.
I have pictures.

120
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,085
That's better than a description.

121
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:18,999
Sir...

122
00:15:21,847 --> 00:15:22,837
What?

123
00:15:24,527 --> 00:15:25,517
That's impossible.

124
00:15:26,647 --> 00:15:27,762
The guy was here.

125
00:15:28,287 --> 00:15:30,403
I saw him with my own eyes.

126
00:15:30,687 --> 00:15:32,564
Wet, with a towel.

127
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:36,084
It's impossible. There must be
something wrong with that app.

128
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,286
There must be an explanation.

129
00:15:42,127 --> 00:15:43,322
That's not mine.

130
00:15:43,887 --> 00:15:46,606
I didn't have a drop of alcohol.

131
00:15:47,087 --> 00:15:48,316
Can someone join you?

132
00:15:48,607 --> 00:15:49,802
Friends or relatives?

133
00:15:50,207 --> 00:15:52,562
So you're not alone when he
comes back.

134
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,477
Do you think I make it all up?

135
00:15:57,127 --> 00:15:59,357
A divorce, moving house...

136
00:15:59,687 --> 00:16:02,725
Those are stress factors.
Maybe also at work...

137
00:16:03,647 --> 00:16:05,558
Am I going crazy?

138
00:16:05,967 --> 00:16:07,526
Am I going crazy?

139
00:16:07,607 --> 00:16:10,281
No, that's not what we're saying,
but maybe...

140
00:16:10,407 --> 00:16:12,159
Maybe the pressure's worse than
you think.

141
00:16:14,927 --> 00:16:15,917
Sorry.

142
00:16:16,287 --> 00:16:17,277
It's just that...

143
00:16:18,767 --> 00:16:20,997
this guy makes me rather nervous.

144
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:26,605
We'll have another look upstairs.
Maybe we missed a spot.

145
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:48,482
Funny, guys.

146
00:18:38,727 --> 00:18:39,717
Well...

147
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:58,238
Natalie.
-Have you got my car keys?

148
00:19:01,447 --> 00:19:03,279
Why would I have them?

149
00:19:03,647 --> 00:19:04,637
I don't know.

150
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:06,836
To annoy me?

151
00:19:08,207 --> 00:19:11,677
I haven't seen them since you
came to get your boxes.

152
00:19:13,607 --> 00:19:17,316
I don't think so. I'll have a look.

153
00:19:17,967 --> 00:19:20,038
Quick, I have to go to court.

154
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:21,917
OK.

155
00:19:41,927 --> 00:19:43,361
Damned assholes.

156
00:19:52,887 --> 00:19:55,447
Karl and Lionel thought they
were funny.

157
00:19:59,207 --> 00:20:01,847
<i>Every shoe, sandal or sneaker...</i>

158
00:20:01,927 --> 00:20:04,203
You didn't wait long before someone
moved in.

159
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:05,277
I'm alone.

160
00:20:06,487 --> 00:20:08,205
The TV turned itself on.

161
00:20:13,487 --> 00:20:18,357
<i>I was amazed. I was in Manhattan,
in the heart of New York.</i>

162
00:20:18,727 --> 00:20:20,604
<i>And there were sales going on
everywhere.</i>

163
00:20:53,207 --> 00:20:55,278
Hey Rebecca, it's here.

164
00:20:55,807 --> 00:20:57,400
Did you already lose your keys?

165
00:20:57,527 --> 00:21:01,077
There's a bum going in and out as if
it's his house.

166
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:04,239
He must have the keys of the previous
owner.

167
00:21:05,367 --> 00:21:06,357
And?

168
00:21:07,407 --> 00:21:08,477
What do you think?

169
00:21:09,447 --> 00:21:10,926
Our new office?

170
00:21:12,447 --> 00:21:13,642
I'll call Max tomorrow.

171
00:21:14,567 --> 00:21:16,205
I'll explain the situation.

172
00:21:16,287 --> 00:21:18,961
Then he'll come to us with his
project.

173
00:21:19,247 --> 00:21:21,318
And once we have him...

174
00:21:21,407 --> 00:21:24,126
Stef.
-others will follow.

175
00:21:24,247 --> 00:21:25,237
Stef.

176
00:21:26,007 --> 00:21:27,566
I'm doing Max' project.

177
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:29,764
Etienne gave it to me.

178
00:21:30,047 --> 00:21:32,880
Not as an assistant, but with my
name on it.

179
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,364
Fuck, Rebecca.
-I know.

180
00:21:37,727 --> 00:21:38,717
Are you serious?

181
00:21:40,847 --> 00:21:41,837
Is that what happened?

182
00:21:45,927 --> 00:21:48,726
Did Natalie hear from you that we...

183
00:21:48,927 --> 00:21:51,043
Yes, I thought she had to know.

184
00:21:51,367 --> 00:21:52,357
Jesus.

185
00:21:52,967 --> 00:21:55,766
You weren't discrete either,
with Cappaert.

186
00:21:58,007 --> 00:22:00,157
We can continue to see each other,
you know.

187
00:22:00,767 --> 00:22:02,519
You'd better leave.

188
00:22:07,087 --> 00:22:08,646
I'm sorry you're taking it
this way.

189
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:17,157
Alright.

190
00:22:20,967 --> 00:22:22,765
Good luck with your new business.

191
00:22:24,807 --> 00:22:25,797
Really beautiful.

192
00:22:52,127 --> 00:22:53,322
We're done here.

193
00:22:53,607 --> 00:22:56,804
Yes, beautiful.

194
00:23:01,687 --> 00:23:02,677
Max...

195
00:23:03,567 --> 00:23:04,557
Stef speaking.

196
00:23:06,527 --> 00:23:09,804
I'm no longer working with
Etienne & Cappaert.

197
00:23:11,007 --> 00:23:11,997
Yes.

198
00:23:12,247 --> 00:23:15,603
What can I say?
Artistic differences.

199
00:23:16,727 --> 00:23:17,717
No.

200
00:23:18,247 --> 00:23:20,443
Too much production line work without
any personal vision.

201
00:23:22,887 --> 00:23:23,877
Yes.

202
00:23:24,847 --> 00:23:25,837
That's it.

203
00:23:27,167 --> 00:23:31,047
And that's why I want to continue
working with you, Max.

204
00:23:31,127 --> 00:23:34,006
You as master builder, me as
architect.

205
00:23:34,087 --> 00:23:38,126
I'm certain that the two of us can
make the difference.

206
00:23:40,687 --> 00:23:43,679
No, I understand.

207
00:23:47,287 --> 00:23:49,517
Can't we discuss it once?

208
00:23:50,047 --> 00:23:54,120
I'll send you a few new ideas and
then you decide.

209
00:23:59,447 --> 00:24:00,960
What about the day after tomorrow?

210
00:24:04,487 --> 00:24:05,477
Thanks, Max.

211
00:24:05,567 --> 00:24:09,481
You won't regret it.
I swear. It'll be fantastic.

212
00:24:10,087 --> 00:24:11,441
Bye.

213
00:25:25,487 --> 00:25:28,639
<i>Enjoy and cheers, bum!</i>

214
00:25:44,207 --> 00:25:45,277
Open that door.

215
00:25:47,847 --> 00:25:49,076
Open up.

216
00:25:52,607 --> 00:25:54,325
Open the door or I'll kill you.

217
00:25:59,247 --> 00:26:01,363
Who's homeless now?

218
00:26:04,327 --> 00:26:06,045
Get out of my house.

219
00:26:36,287 --> 00:26:37,482
You're going to hurt yourself.

220
00:26:39,647 --> 00:26:41,843
You're going to hurt yourself.

221
00:27:24,767 --> 00:27:26,519
Where are you, asshole?

222
00:27:27,527 --> 00:27:28,926
Show yourself.

223
00:28:46,327 --> 00:28:50,719
There's no need for a court case.
-I knew that would get you over here.

224
00:28:50,887 --> 00:28:54,005
I'm beginning to understand why
this was so cheap.

225
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:56,246
What didn't you tell me?

226
00:28:56,807 --> 00:28:58,844
Nothing at all.
Why do you think that?

227
00:28:58,927 --> 00:29:01,487
Because a man keeps coming in just
like that.

228
00:29:01,567 --> 00:29:06,164
He has a bath or a shower and claims
that the house is his.

229
00:29:06,927 --> 00:29:09,316
I've had all the locks replaced.

230
00:29:09,407 --> 00:29:11,205
I'll send an invoice for that.

231
00:29:11,327 --> 00:29:14,160
And yet this guy keeps coming in.

232
00:29:16,967 --> 00:29:18,196
Did he do that?

233
00:29:19,607 --> 00:29:21,405
It's his fault, yes.

234
00:29:26,887 --> 00:29:29,037
And that window...

235
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:30,721
He also did that.

236
00:29:31,767 --> 00:29:32,757
Is that the reason?

237
00:29:32,927 --> 00:29:34,884
The reason why it was empty for
so long?

238
00:29:35,127 --> 00:29:37,323
A fight with the previous owner?

239
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,399
There is no fight.

240
00:29:39,607 --> 00:29:40,756
Besides, that would...

241
00:29:41,527 --> 00:29:42,517
Yes?

242
00:29:43,887 --> 00:29:47,164
That would be impossible.
The previous owner died.

243
00:29:48,807 --> 00:29:51,196
Was he killed in his bed by a bum?

244
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:53,157
No.

245
00:29:54,327 --> 00:29:55,317
It was...

246
00:29:56,887 --> 00:29:57,877
Suicide.

247
00:29:59,727 --> 00:30:00,717
Suicide?

248
00:30:01,687 --> 00:30:02,677
Here?

249
00:30:03,207 --> 00:30:06,040
The previous owner committed
suicide here?

250
00:30:06,647 --> 00:30:10,527
So I heard. I wasn't working for
Immo Castelyns back then.

251
00:30:10,607 --> 00:30:12,837
Some say it was an accident.

252
00:30:12,927 --> 00:30:15,237
I'm beginning to understand your
discretion.

253
00:30:15,487 --> 00:30:18,081
A dead person in the house doesn't
sell well.

254
00:30:18,287 --> 00:30:20,119
You're the one who wanted to
sign fast.

255
00:30:20,287 --> 00:30:24,360
I didn't want to ruin it for you.
-He's doing it for you.

256
00:30:27,447 --> 00:30:28,482
Or is it a relative?

257
00:30:29,407 --> 00:30:31,364
Who's against the sale?

258
00:30:31,967 --> 00:30:35,198
I don't think so. The parents gave us
power of attorney.

259
00:30:35,287 --> 00:30:38,882
If someone from that side's causing
problems, you should go to them.

260
00:30:38,967 --> 00:30:40,878
We're not responsible.

261
00:30:40,967 --> 00:30:43,880
The sale was completely by
the book.

262
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:04,478
VALCKE 14 LEEUWERIKLAAN SUICIDE

263
00:31:25,819 --> 00:31:29,892
Sad to report the death of Theo
Valcke...

264
00:31:30,228 --> 00:31:32,021
Julie Valcke, his daughter

265
00:31:40,407 --> 00:31:43,240
<i>Authorities investigate suspicious
death of 40 year old man</i>

266
00:32:08,087 --> 00:32:09,077
Theo?

267
00:32:11,287 --> 00:32:12,436
Theo Valcke?

268
00:32:20,407 --> 00:32:21,966
Anybody there?

269
00:32:32,167 --> 00:32:34,283
Is your hand ok?
-Fine.

270
00:32:36,807 --> 00:32:37,797
I'm on to you.

271
00:32:38,447 --> 00:32:40,120
It took a little while.

272
00:32:40,247 --> 00:32:41,601
The coin dropped.

273
00:32:42,847 --> 00:32:45,885
I'm in some kind of stupid TV show.

274
00:32:46,887 --> 00:32:47,877
Am I right?

275
00:32:48,127 --> 00:32:49,481
My house is full of cameras.

276
00:32:50,407 --> 00:32:53,798
Those assholes Karl and Lionel have
entered my name.

277
00:32:55,167 --> 00:32:59,525
That Immo woman and those fake websites
are also part of it.

278
00:33:01,767 --> 00:33:02,757
Where did you get that idea?

279
00:33:03,447 --> 00:33:04,721
One.

280
00:33:05,087 --> 00:33:11,003
I didn't chose to do this. Two.
I don't like this kind of nonsense.

281
00:33:11,607 --> 00:33:14,167
I'll tell you what I plan to
do now.

282
00:33:15,807 --> 00:33:18,117
I'm going to stab him...

283
00:33:19,367 --> 00:33:22,325
with this knife.

284
00:33:24,847 --> 00:33:26,679
Because if you're dead...

285
00:33:26,927 --> 00:33:28,679
you won't feel anything anyway.

286
00:33:29,287 --> 00:33:31,676
You can't die twice, can you?

287
00:33:32,687 --> 00:33:33,677
No idea.

288
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:35,878
I only died once.

289
00:33:35,967 --> 00:33:37,480
Ok, good joke.

290
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:40,765
I understand you have to continue
playing your role.

291
00:33:42,447 --> 00:33:47,317
This is the moment to say 'stop' and
show me where the cameras are.

292
00:33:48,367 --> 00:33:49,721
You really have too much...

293
00:33:50,327 --> 00:33:52,238
imagination.
-Ah.

294
00:33:52,647 --> 00:33:54,638
At three, I stab.

295
00:33:56,207 --> 00:33:57,197
Ok?

296
00:33:57,727 --> 00:33:58,717
Agreed?

297
00:34:01,767 --> 00:34:02,757
One.

298
00:34:04,927 --> 00:34:05,917
Two.

299
00:34:07,687 --> 00:34:09,405
You can still stop me.

300
00:34:13,047 --> 00:34:14,037
Three?

301
00:34:42,287 --> 00:34:43,766
Fourteen over nine.

302
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:45,362
A bit too high.

303
00:34:45,967 --> 00:34:48,322
It must have to do with
the divorce.

304
00:34:48,967 --> 00:34:50,037
Other than that...

305
00:34:50,487 --> 00:34:52,125
I don't see anything abnormal.

306
00:34:55,567 --> 00:34:57,956
Pol, something absurd's
going on.

307
00:35:00,047 --> 00:35:02,163
There's a guy walking around in
my house.

308
00:35:03,567 --> 00:35:05,877
That asshole has already locked
me out.

309
00:35:06,527 --> 00:35:09,201
Ok.
-I'm calling the police.

310
00:35:09,647 --> 00:35:12,321
He disappears.
I take a picture.

311
00:35:12,967 --> 00:35:13,957
Look.

312
00:35:16,407 --> 00:35:17,920
The guy's not in it.

313
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:19,801
And I found this.

314
00:35:29,367 --> 00:35:31,244
That's the previous owner.

315
00:35:31,327 --> 00:35:32,761
And?

316
00:35:35,207 --> 00:35:36,197
And it's my visitor.

317
00:35:37,567 --> 00:35:40,844
You don't need to say it's impossible.
I know.

318
00:35:41,687 --> 00:35:43,758
And yet I see him like I see you.

319
00:35:44,727 --> 00:35:49,005
The police think I drink too much.
I'm starting to think so too.

320
00:35:50,447 --> 00:35:51,437
Come with me.

321
00:35:52,887 --> 00:35:56,596
Come. Look.

322
00:35:58,887 --> 00:36:01,003
Did he do that?
-No, I did.

323
00:36:01,807 --> 00:36:02,797
Ah.

324
00:36:03,367 --> 00:36:06,246
I'm not even going to explain why.

325
00:36:07,407 --> 00:36:09,159
Did anyone else see him?

326
00:36:11,167 --> 00:36:12,965
I don't think so.

327
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:16,037
Pol...

328
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:18,080
am I going crazy?

329
00:36:18,607 --> 00:36:20,962
I don't notice anything to worry
about yet.

330
00:36:21,207 --> 00:36:24,802
But you can't deny that being fired,
divorcing, moving house...

331
00:36:24,887 --> 00:36:27,447
can lead to stress.
-I already know that.

332
00:36:27,567 --> 00:36:30,798
You can compare it to a process
of mourning.

333
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:34,799
Should I look at that too?
-No, it's alright.

334
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:37,239
Has it ever happened to you?

335
00:36:38,047 --> 00:36:40,004
What?
-People who...

336
00:36:41,287 --> 00:36:42,607
see dead people.

337
00:36:45,607 --> 00:36:46,597
Yes?

338
00:36:47,967 --> 00:36:48,957
A woman...

339
00:36:49,967 --> 00:36:51,560
who saw her deceased husband.

340
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:55,441
What did you...

341
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:56,837
advise her?

342
00:36:59,847 --> 00:37:01,201
Try to live with it.

343
00:37:08,167 --> 00:37:09,157
Are you serious?

344
00:37:11,287 --> 00:37:13,676
Are you serious, Pol?
-Stef...

345
00:37:14,487 --> 00:37:17,001
I take all my patients seriously.

346
00:37:18,327 --> 00:37:20,204
If someone sees a dead person...

347
00:37:21,087 --> 00:37:23,397
I don't have medication for that.

348
00:37:23,647 --> 00:37:25,604
Try to relax a bit.

349
00:37:26,007 --> 00:37:28,078
Stop drinking for a while.

350
00:37:28,967 --> 00:37:29,957
Maybe...

351
00:37:30,367 --> 00:37:32,005
it will go away on its own.

352
00:37:33,447 --> 00:37:34,437
And if not...

353
00:37:37,847 --> 00:37:39,485
What's that?
-Someone who...

354
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,486
comes to heal your house.

355
00:37:42,807 --> 00:37:43,956
Exorcize spirits.

356
00:37:44,767 --> 00:37:47,566
The woman was quite content.

357
00:37:48,986 --> 00:37:51,546
I'll forever deny...

358
00:37:52,066 --> 00:37:53,977
giving you that number.

359
00:37:56,106 --> 00:37:57,460
What if it was Natalie?

360
00:37:58,146 --> 00:38:00,865
What if she did it to get back
at me?

361
00:38:35,066 --> 00:38:40,015
I have to tell you... ghosts and
stuff...

362
00:38:40,226 --> 00:38:42,376
I don't believe in it.
-Entities.

363
00:38:43,026 --> 00:38:44,016
What?

364
00:38:44,386 --> 00:38:45,945
We call them entities.

365
00:38:47,026 --> 00:38:49,097
Entities? I don't believe in them.

366
00:38:49,186 --> 00:38:53,259
Nobody believes in them, sir,
until you're facing them.

367
00:38:57,706 --> 00:38:59,982
Put it here.

368
00:39:02,626 --> 00:39:04,936
Is he or she...

369
00:39:05,226 --> 00:39:07,183
a deceased family member?

370
00:39:07,266 --> 00:39:09,257
No, he came with the house.

371
00:39:10,386 --> 00:39:14,380
They want me to believe he's
the previous owner who...

372
00:39:14,906 --> 00:39:16,658
committed suicide here...

373
00:39:16,746 --> 00:39:17,736
in this house.

374
00:39:17,826 --> 00:39:18,816
Smells?

375
00:39:19,026 --> 00:39:20,016
Sounds?

376
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:24,778
Objects that suddenly disappear?

377
00:39:25,426 --> 00:39:27,781
He has a thing with electricity.

378
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:30,335
Yes, typical.

379
00:39:31,546 --> 00:39:34,299
Where do you see the entity
the most?

380
00:39:36,266 --> 00:39:37,256
Here.

381
00:39:38,786 --> 00:39:40,857
And in the dining room.

382
00:39:41,186 --> 00:39:44,065
Ok, let's start there then.

383
00:39:52,386 --> 00:39:53,376
Blow.

384
00:40:22,106 --> 00:40:23,096
Sage.

385
00:40:23,706 --> 00:40:25,936
Was already used by the old Indians.

386
00:40:27,106 --> 00:40:28,744
You can open a window...

387
00:40:29,066 --> 00:40:31,819
so the entities leave the house.

388
00:41:06,906 --> 00:41:07,896
Please.

389
00:41:11,786 --> 00:41:13,015
I'll measure it now.

390
00:41:23,226 --> 00:41:24,899
You can see the result.

391
00:41:25,186 --> 00:41:28,383
A remainder of an entity would
create a huge peak...

392
00:41:28,666 --> 00:41:30,782
but here it stays green.

393
00:41:48,146 --> 00:41:49,181
An old radio.

394
00:41:49,426 --> 00:41:52,418
That's a magnetic field.
That's not abnormal.

395
00:41:52,666 --> 00:41:57,024
Other devices will do the same.
This TV, for instance.

396
00:42:04,666 --> 00:42:09,103
As I said, that's not abnormal.

397
00:42:11,066 --> 00:42:13,262
Yes, our friend?
- The radio.

398
00:42:13,946 --> 00:42:17,143
Did you create the device yourself?
-Yes, I did.

399
00:42:17,666 --> 00:42:20,306
You could buy a detection kit,
if you wanted.

400
00:42:21,106 --> 00:42:23,143
The professional kit...

401
00:42:23,226 --> 00:42:25,422
that I use myself, of course.

402
00:42:26,066 --> 00:42:31,379
You'd have to pay around 810 euros.

403
00:42:31,666 --> 00:42:34,624
I wouldn't hesitate, Stef.
Such an opportunity...

404
00:42:34,706 --> 00:42:35,696
Right next to you.

405
00:42:35,826 --> 00:42:37,499
He's behind you.

406
00:42:37,706 --> 00:42:40,539
No, I don't see anything here.

407
00:42:40,866 --> 00:42:42,379
I don't see anything move.

408
00:42:42,786 --> 00:42:43,776
No.

409
00:42:44,106 --> 00:42:45,096
It's in the green.

410
00:42:45,786 --> 00:42:46,856
Nothing.

411
00:42:47,026 --> 00:42:49,666
I think we can call this a success.

412
00:42:51,146 --> 00:42:52,136
Loser.

413
00:43:01,026 --> 00:43:02,221
What do you want from me?

414
00:43:03,306 --> 00:43:05,138
I want you to leave my house.

415
00:43:05,346 --> 00:43:06,336
Why?

416
00:43:06,506 --> 00:43:07,576
I was here first.

417
00:43:09,506 --> 00:43:11,736
Then we have a problem, Theo.

418
00:43:12,586 --> 00:43:14,418
I'm beginning to get
attached to...

419
00:43:15,066 --> 00:43:16,465
this crazy house.

420
00:43:16,546 --> 00:43:19,106
Natalie kicked me out of my home.

421
00:43:19,226 --> 00:43:21,137
My father-in-law kicked me out of
my work.

422
00:43:21,226 --> 00:43:22,216
Not again.

423
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:24,379
And certainly not by a guy...

424
00:43:24,906 --> 00:43:27,785
who got out in a cowardly way
himself.

425
00:43:27,946 --> 00:43:29,141
That was an accident.

426
00:43:30,146 --> 00:43:31,375
How did you do it?

427
00:43:33,346 --> 00:43:34,336
Pills and whisky?

428
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:37,383
No, you slit your wrists in
the bathtub.

429
00:43:37,466 --> 00:43:39,901
That's more your style.

430
00:43:39,986 --> 00:43:41,624
Can I see your wrists?

431
00:43:46,866 --> 00:43:48,265
I could hurt you.

432
00:43:48,346 --> 00:43:51,862
You don't know what you're getting into.
-Was it in the bathroom?

433
00:43:51,946 --> 00:43:52,936
With a clothing line.

434
00:43:55,786 --> 00:43:59,745
<i>Don't you have to start searching?
-It's all under control.</i>

435
00:43:59,826 --> 00:44:01,464
<i>There's been another accident.</i>

436
00:44:27,306 --> 00:44:28,296
Ok.

437
00:44:32,386 --> 00:44:34,059
Is that it, Theo?

438
00:44:34,146 --> 00:44:35,784
Is that all you can do?

439
00:44:35,866 --> 00:44:38,176
Messing with the electricity a bit?

440
00:44:38,666 --> 00:44:41,385
No flying cupboards or knives?

441
00:44:41,906 --> 00:44:42,896
I think...

442
00:44:43,266 --> 00:44:45,940
you're a second grade entity.

443
00:44:52,906 --> 00:44:54,499
Not very impressive, Theo.

444
00:44:54,946 --> 00:44:56,425
Not very impressive.

445
00:46:12,466 --> 00:46:13,865
Let me tell you, Theo.

446
00:46:13,946 --> 00:46:16,460
You don't need all that technology.

447
00:46:16,666 --> 00:46:17,656
Back to basics.

448
00:46:18,146 --> 00:46:19,625
Have a drink with me?

449
00:46:20,106 --> 00:46:21,096
No?

450
00:46:25,466 --> 00:46:26,456
Don't you miss that?

451
00:46:27,746 --> 00:46:29,657
A red wine every now and then?

452
00:46:29,826 --> 00:46:31,863
I can live without electricity.

453
00:46:32,066 --> 00:46:34,580
But no red wine, that's hard.

454
00:46:36,106 --> 00:46:37,096
Is that yours?

455
00:46:38,066 --> 00:46:39,659
Did you stand here like this too?

456
00:46:39,746 --> 00:46:42,898
Barbecuing for your wife?

457
00:46:46,186 --> 00:46:47,859
I saw your obituary card.

458
00:46:48,546 --> 00:46:49,945
Widower.

459
00:46:51,946 --> 00:46:53,266
Did she go before you?

460
00:46:53,346 --> 00:46:56,464
I'm wondering: why isn't she
standing next to you?

461
00:46:56,546 --> 00:46:57,616
Drop it.

462
00:46:58,706 --> 00:47:00,583
Or did she make a deal up there?

463
00:47:00,826 --> 00:47:02,225
I finally got rid of him.

464
00:47:02,506 --> 00:47:04,383
Please leave him downstairs.

465
00:47:05,346 --> 00:47:09,055
That would explain why you're here,
annoying everyone.

466
00:47:11,826 --> 00:47:13,942
Did she also kill herself?

467
00:47:14,026 --> 00:47:16,461
To get rid of you?
I understand that.

468
00:47:16,586 --> 00:47:19,305
You'd do it for less.
Come on, man.

469
00:47:19,786 --> 00:47:23,859
Let's sort it out. Here and now.
Come on.

470
00:47:25,386 --> 00:47:26,376
Come on then.

471
00:47:27,426 --> 00:47:28,416
Come.

472
00:47:30,946 --> 00:47:32,220
You can't go outside.

473
00:47:34,266 --> 00:47:35,620
Are you locked up?

474
00:47:35,946 --> 00:47:39,735
Locked up in the big house?
That's a pity.

475
00:47:39,826 --> 00:47:43,979
Come, get me.

476
00:47:44,106 --> 00:47:45,096
Come.

477
00:47:46,946 --> 00:47:48,095
Yeah, walk away.

478
00:47:48,226 --> 00:47:50,740
Make some more light bulbs explode.
Loser.

479
00:47:51,146 --> 00:47:54,343
Little birdie is locked up!

480
00:47:54,426 --> 00:47:57,976
You were hanging off a rope!

481
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:05,183
Max.
-Everything alright?

482
00:48:06,386 --> 00:48:08,343
I've been ringing the doorbell
for a long time.

483
00:48:09,066 --> 00:48:10,864
There's something wrong with
the electricity.

484
00:48:15,666 --> 00:48:16,861
Come on.

485
00:48:34,226 --> 00:48:35,216
Wow.

486
00:48:35,626 --> 00:48:36,616
New?

487
00:48:38,506 --> 00:48:42,261
Tell me, Stef, Rebecca gave her
presentation yesterday.

488
00:48:42,346 --> 00:48:45,816
We were very impressed.
She's very driven.

489
00:48:46,066 --> 00:48:48,182
Yes, very...

490
00:48:48,266 --> 00:48:51,577
I won't beat around the bush.
I'm here because you asked me.

491
00:48:52,546 --> 00:48:53,695
I'd say...

492
00:48:54,226 --> 00:48:56,376
Come up with something brilliant.

493
00:48:57,786 --> 00:48:58,776
Yes.

494
00:49:00,066 --> 00:49:01,739
I need more time.

495
00:49:05,186 --> 00:49:06,176
Don't you have anything?

496
00:49:09,026 --> 00:49:10,016
No.

497
00:49:12,186 --> 00:49:14,496
Not even the decency to call me?

498
00:49:16,706 --> 00:49:18,902
There was no need for me to come.

499
00:49:19,266 --> 00:49:20,256
Man, man.

500
00:49:20,866 --> 00:49:21,856
Max.

501
00:49:22,386 --> 00:49:23,376
Max.

502
00:49:24,106 --> 00:49:25,699
Give me two days.

503
00:49:25,946 --> 00:49:26,936
Jesus.

504
00:49:28,106 --> 00:49:30,336
Max, two days.

505
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:33,942
Give me two days and I'll put something
brilliant on paper.

506
00:49:34,026 --> 00:49:36,381
I know your private problems, Stef.

507
00:49:36,746 --> 00:49:37,861
They're no excuse.

508
00:49:38,066 --> 00:49:41,536
Rebecca, you used her, dumped her
and broke her heart.

509
00:49:41,626 --> 00:49:45,779
But there she was yesterday.
Professional and with a good plan.

510
00:49:49,266 --> 00:49:51,416
That bitch cheated on me.

511
00:49:55,346 --> 00:49:56,336
Max.

512
00:49:56,906 --> 00:49:57,896
Max.

513
00:49:59,786 --> 00:50:00,776
Please, Max.

514
00:50:16,306 --> 00:50:17,819
No!

515
00:50:23,986 --> 00:50:24,976
Are you crazy?

516
00:50:25,626 --> 00:50:26,855
Are you completely crazy?

517
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:28,056
That wasn't me.

518
00:50:28,386 --> 00:50:31,981
You'll never get any work again.
Everybody will hear about this.

519
00:50:32,186 --> 00:50:34,700
I swear, Max.
The dead guy inside did it.

520
00:50:35,066 --> 00:50:36,056
Wait!

521
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:37,456
Max!

522
00:50:38,706 --> 00:50:39,696
Wait!

523
00:50:40,546 --> 00:50:42,219
Max, wait!

524
00:50:50,546 --> 00:50:51,581
Theo!

525
00:50:55,666 --> 00:50:57,100
Theo!

526
00:50:59,826 --> 00:51:01,419
I needed that customer.

527
00:51:01,506 --> 00:51:03,383
Asshole!
-What will you do?

528
00:51:04,506 --> 00:51:05,496
Kill me?

529
00:51:06,746 --> 00:51:07,941
Leaving is easier.

530
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:10,456
Never.

531
00:51:11,706 --> 00:51:12,696
Do you hear me?

532
00:51:13,146 --> 00:51:15,660
I'm dead, not deaf.

533
00:52:03,306 --> 00:52:07,539
Mariano, I'm only asking for a chance
when you start a new project.

534
00:52:09,106 --> 00:52:10,096
Hello?

535
00:52:15,306 --> 00:52:16,785
To make a proposal too.

536
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:19,416
Yes.

537
00:52:20,226 --> 00:52:22,297
I'll mail you my new data.

538
00:52:22,586 --> 00:52:25,100
Alright. Thanks a lot, Mario,
Mariano.

539
00:52:34,746 --> 00:52:35,736
Sandra?

540
00:52:36,426 --> 00:52:37,746
Stef speaking.

541
00:52:39,506 --> 00:52:41,463
Veronique, Stef speaking.

542
00:52:41,626 --> 00:52:43,822
Aelterman. Yes, it's been
a long time.

543
00:52:43,946 --> 00:52:46,460
Vero, did you know I'm a freelancer
again?

544
00:52:48,626 --> 00:52:51,140
No, my window's open. Of my office.

545
00:52:52,946 --> 00:52:54,141
Ah, at the camping?

546
00:52:55,106 --> 00:52:56,858
No, no.

547
00:52:57,346 --> 00:52:58,336
What did you say?

548
00:52:58,786 --> 00:52:59,776
Colour advice?

549
00:53:01,506 --> 00:53:02,621
Yes, I do that too.

550
00:53:03,786 --> 00:53:04,776
Again.

551
00:53:42,306 --> 00:53:43,979
Enjoy.
-Fuck.

552
00:53:57,386 --> 00:53:58,376
Stef?

553
00:53:59,426 --> 00:54:00,416
Stef?

554
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:10,536
What are you...

555
00:54:11,426 --> 00:54:12,985
What are you doing here?

556
00:54:13,066 --> 00:54:15,057
Are you camping in front of your
own house?

557
00:54:21,586 --> 00:54:24,704
Problems with electricity.
They'll pass.

558
00:54:25,426 --> 00:54:26,860
That's what you think.

559
00:54:29,946 --> 00:54:30,936
Why are you here?

560
00:54:33,106 --> 00:54:34,221
I've come to warn you.

561
00:54:35,466 --> 00:54:36,661
Etienne's furious.

562
00:54:37,506 --> 00:54:38,496
He wants your hide.

563
00:54:38,826 --> 00:54:41,545
He knows you tried to steal
Max from us.

564
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:43,698
He didn't get it from me, but from
Max himself.

565
00:54:44,106 --> 00:54:45,938
What did you do to his car?

566
00:54:48,906 --> 00:54:49,896
Long story.

567
00:54:56,746 --> 00:54:59,056
I don't know if that was very
smart, sweetie.

568
00:54:59,146 --> 00:55:01,296
No, that wasn't very smart,
sweetie.

569
00:55:01,426 --> 00:55:04,020
Your contract has a competition
clause.

570
00:55:04,186 --> 00:55:06,018
Etienne says you violated it.

571
00:55:06,146 --> 00:55:09,104
He'll claim back everything he
paid you.

572
00:55:10,586 --> 00:55:13,226
I think you need a good lawyer.

573
00:55:13,466 --> 00:55:16,060
I'm divorcing the best lawyer.

574
00:55:17,026 --> 00:55:18,346
I have a proposition.

575
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:20,056
I'm listening.

576
00:55:20,866 --> 00:55:22,777
You help me with my drawings.

577
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:24,545
With my designs.

578
00:55:24,666 --> 00:55:26,737
I admire your talent.
You know that.

579
00:55:27,066 --> 00:55:30,138
It shouldn't get lost because you're
having a hard time.

580
00:55:31,186 --> 00:55:32,620
So, you work for me.

581
00:55:33,466 --> 00:55:35,776
Nobody at Cappaert needs to know.

582
00:55:42,666 --> 00:55:43,656
Your name...

583
00:55:43,826 --> 00:55:45,146
will be on my designs?

584
00:55:45,466 --> 00:55:47,139
I'll pay you, of course.

585
00:55:48,546 --> 00:55:50,662
I don't think you have a choice.

586
00:55:55,226 --> 00:55:57,024
We can continue seeing each other.

587
00:55:58,586 --> 00:56:00,418
I thought you didn't want that.

588
00:56:02,106 --> 00:56:03,255
Do I have much choice?

589
00:56:14,546 --> 00:56:17,937
Shall we go upstairs?
-With pleasure.

590
00:56:21,386 --> 00:56:23,946
I feel like someone's watching us.

591
00:56:27,946 --> 00:56:28,936
Come.

592
00:56:40,266 --> 00:56:43,338
It will be a peepshow, Stef.
I'm very grateful.

593
00:56:43,586 --> 00:56:47,944
Sex on this side is nothing.
No fun, useless.

594
00:56:53,906 --> 00:56:54,896
Wait.

595
00:56:54,986 --> 00:56:55,976
I'll be right back.

596
00:56:56,466 --> 00:56:57,456
Stay.

597
00:56:58,546 --> 00:56:59,536
Stay.

598
00:57:08,666 --> 00:57:10,657
Don't let us wait too long.

599
00:57:49,066 --> 00:57:50,056
Are you crazy?

600
00:57:50,906 --> 00:57:52,055
My car!

601
00:58:01,106 --> 00:58:02,096
Asshole!

602
00:58:03,626 --> 00:58:05,537
Stop it! Stop!

603
00:58:06,106 --> 00:58:07,096
Stop!

604
00:58:08,066 --> 00:58:09,056
There.

605
00:58:09,226 --> 00:58:13,743
I changed the design of your car.
Put your name on it.

606
00:58:15,146 --> 00:58:16,136
Madman.

607
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:18,016
Bitch.

608
00:58:21,466 --> 00:58:22,456
Man.

609
00:58:22,746 --> 00:58:25,625
When I scratch your car, you
get angry.

610
00:58:35,546 --> 00:58:39,096
You could have had sex first and
then redecorate her car.

611
00:58:40,586 --> 00:58:41,621
I understand.

612
00:58:42,146 --> 00:58:43,944
You're a man of principle.

613
00:58:45,586 --> 00:58:46,576
How do you do it?

614
00:58:47,466 --> 00:58:50,584
How do you make enemies so fast?

615
00:58:51,866 --> 00:58:53,379
It's a very special talent.

616
00:58:55,186 --> 00:58:57,177
Did you study for it?

617
00:59:00,706 --> 00:59:01,696
Well...

618
00:59:02,506 --> 00:59:04,099
we'll wait for the bailiff.

619
00:59:04,546 --> 00:59:06,184
Then the house will be mine again.

620
00:59:09,346 --> 00:59:10,575
I'm not gone yet.

621
00:59:10,746 --> 00:59:12,544
You're still a show-off.

622
00:59:13,026 --> 00:59:14,016
Stefaan.

623
00:59:24,306 --> 00:59:25,296
<i>Yes?</i>

624
00:59:25,786 --> 00:59:28,096
I heard your father wants to
destroy me.

625
00:59:29,906 --> 00:59:31,977
<i>Do you remember New Year's Eve?</i>

626
00:59:34,506 --> 00:59:38,977
<i>And that he said you were his son-in-law
and his best friend?</i>

627
00:59:41,666 --> 00:59:43,976
<i>He'd been drinking, but he meant it.</i>

628
00:59:44,386 --> 00:59:46,138
<i>You broke his heart as well.</i>

629
00:59:46,946 --> 00:59:48,903
<i>And you didn't read your
contract well.</i>

630
00:59:49,706 --> 00:59:52,937
birdie, you've been caught...

631
00:59:53,066 --> 00:59:56,457
they'll hang you by your balls...

632
00:59:56,546 --> 00:59:57,536
<i>Are you still there?</i>

633
01:00:00,186 --> 01:00:02,302
Everybody's entitled to defence.

634
01:00:02,386 --> 01:00:03,785
You always say that.

635
01:00:04,346 --> 01:00:05,700
Does it also apply to me?

636
01:00:06,426 --> 01:00:07,746
<i>Even to you.</i>

637
01:00:08,306 --> 01:00:09,660
I only know...

638
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:11,096
engineers...

639
01:00:11,186 --> 01:00:12,824
carpenters and...

640
01:00:13,466 --> 01:00:14,456
architects.

641
01:00:14,946 --> 01:00:18,496
So, I'm coming to you for
a good lawyer.

642
01:00:19,546 --> 01:00:20,866
To save my skin.

643
01:00:21,786 --> 01:00:22,776
And your money.

644
01:00:24,626 --> 01:00:26,139
<i>I'll get your skin regardless.</i>

645
01:00:26,866 --> 01:00:30,018
<i>But I'll see if someone can save
my money.</i>

646
01:00:31,226 --> 01:00:32,341
<i>I'll let you know.</i>

647
01:00:35,026 --> 01:00:36,016
Thank you.

648
01:02:10,506 --> 01:02:11,496
I can see your...

649
01:02:12,666 --> 01:02:14,577
little entity, Stef.

650
01:02:39,586 --> 01:02:42,704
Ouch! You're hurting me! Let me go!

651
01:02:44,426 --> 01:02:46,064
What did you steal?
-Nothing.

652
01:02:46,146 --> 01:02:47,341
Empty your bag.

653
01:02:47,426 --> 01:02:50,896
I didn't steal anything.
-Empty it or I'll call the police.

654
01:02:51,626 --> 01:02:52,616
Jesus.

655
01:03:01,226 --> 01:03:02,216
What do you want here?

656
01:03:02,786 --> 01:03:04,459
I saw you outside as well.

657
01:03:04,746 --> 01:03:06,623
I used to li... work here.

658
01:03:07,226 --> 01:03:09,502
For the previous owner.

659
01:03:10,066 --> 01:03:11,420
Aren't you a bit young?

660
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:12,736
A holiday job.

661
01:03:13,266 --> 01:03:14,620
Do you need someone?

662
01:03:15,186 --> 01:03:16,904
Cooking, cleaning.
I can do everything.

663
01:03:18,146 --> 01:03:21,025
First you steal from me and
then I have to give you a job?

664
01:03:21,186 --> 01:03:22,620
I didn't steal from you.

665
01:03:30,986 --> 01:03:31,976
What?

666
01:03:32,826 --> 01:03:33,896
Who's camping there?

667
01:03:36,186 --> 01:03:37,301
The new owner.

668
01:03:38,666 --> 01:03:40,657
I don't need anybody.
Get lost.

669
01:03:46,346 --> 01:03:47,336
Come.

670
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:27,102
Yes, I'm going.
-Wait.

671
01:04:30,546 --> 01:04:31,775
You said you can do anything,
didn't you?

672
01:04:33,026 --> 01:04:35,381
Could you look at the electricity?

673
01:04:36,746 --> 01:04:37,895
You know where it is.

674
01:04:40,226 --> 01:04:41,216
Ok.

675
01:04:42,426 --> 01:04:43,416
Super.

676
01:04:47,706 --> 01:04:49,583
Do you see anything wrong?
-No.

677
01:04:50,106 --> 01:04:51,585
Me neither.

678
01:04:51,866 --> 01:04:55,222
It all seems to work.
There's a problem, but the light...

679
01:04:57,866 --> 01:04:59,015
works now.

680
01:05:00,466 --> 01:05:01,456
That's strange.

681
01:05:08,826 --> 01:05:10,703
I think you bring me luck.

682
01:05:12,306 --> 01:05:13,296
Julie.

683
01:05:14,226 --> 01:05:16,502
Julie, if you want, you've got
a job.

684
01:05:17,466 --> 01:05:20,265
You can start right away, because
it's a mess.

685
01:05:20,746 --> 01:05:21,736
Ok.

686
01:06:35,466 --> 01:06:36,456
What?

687
01:06:37,386 --> 01:06:38,581
Yes, I'm still here.

688
01:06:39,746 --> 01:06:41,703
You don't have to come get me.

689
01:06:42,986 --> 01:06:44,499
A guy alone. Why?

690
01:06:46,666 --> 01:06:48,065
I don't know, Robin.

691
01:06:49,066 --> 01:06:50,500
As long as I want.

692
01:07:02,986 --> 01:07:04,306
What are you going to do?

693
01:07:05,226 --> 01:07:07,263
Fuck man, stop that.

694
01:07:07,946 --> 01:07:09,380
You know who that is.

695
01:07:09,466 --> 01:07:12,697
I've only been making enemies.
Now I'm trying to help someone.

696
01:07:12,786 --> 01:07:13,776
Sir?

697
01:07:15,386 --> 01:07:17,423
Did you call me?

698
01:07:18,786 --> 01:07:21,346
I missed a step.
Sorry.

699
01:07:22,186 --> 01:07:23,176
Julie?

700
01:07:23,866 --> 01:07:26,255
We haven't discussed your pay yet.

701
01:07:27,026 --> 01:07:29,381
How much did the previous
owner pay?

702
01:07:29,466 --> 01:07:30,456
Ten euros.

703
01:07:30,586 --> 01:07:32,497
Is that too much?
-No.

704
01:07:32,586 --> 01:07:35,465
Perfect. Oh, Julie, I'm Stef.

705
01:07:36,186 --> 01:07:37,256
Not 'sir'.

706
01:07:37,706 --> 01:07:38,696
Stef.

707
01:07:43,906 --> 01:07:46,056
She's more than worth her money.

708
01:07:53,426 --> 01:07:57,499
I've invited friends for a house warming
party tomorrow.

709
01:07:58,026 --> 01:07:59,619
Do you want to help?

710
01:08:00,826 --> 01:08:01,816
Tomorrow?

711
01:08:01,986 --> 01:08:03,499
It would be great.

712
01:08:06,306 --> 01:08:07,296
Ok.

713
01:08:08,026 --> 01:08:09,016
Super.

714
01:08:12,306 --> 01:08:14,377
Is eight o'clock alright?
-Yes.

715
01:08:23,826 --> 01:08:26,022
You have a very nice daughter,
Theo.

716
01:08:26,466 --> 01:08:27,820
Or should I say 'you had'?

717
01:08:28,546 --> 01:08:30,025
I find that confusing.

718
01:08:33,106 --> 01:08:35,336
Are you sure she's yours?

719
01:08:35,426 --> 01:08:38,020
Or does she look like her mother?
-Don't toy with her.

720
01:08:38,106 --> 01:08:41,736
I didn't invite her.
She came in on her own.

721
01:08:41,866 --> 01:08:42,856
Just like you.

722
01:08:43,506 --> 01:08:45,019
Maybe she's your daughter
after all.

723
01:08:46,146 --> 01:08:47,500
Leave the child alone.

724
01:08:47,626 --> 01:08:50,345
She's suffered enough.
-Can I make some coffee?

725
01:08:51,546 --> 01:08:52,536
Child?

726
01:08:53,586 --> 01:08:55,657
I see a pretty young woman.

727
01:08:56,346 --> 01:08:59,020
I won't say no if she wants
my company.

728
01:08:59,706 --> 01:09:02,664
You're scum.
-I want my house back.

729
01:09:04,266 --> 01:09:05,700
Then I'll leave her alone.

730
01:09:08,146 --> 01:09:09,545
Maybe.

731
01:09:15,986 --> 01:09:17,420
There we go again.

732
01:09:48,786 --> 01:09:49,776
Fuck.

733
01:10:27,866 --> 01:10:29,937
Hello?

734
01:10:34,946 --> 01:10:36,300
Mr. Aelterman...

735
01:10:37,746 --> 01:10:39,657
we're getting lots of complaints
from the neighbours.

736
01:10:39,906 --> 01:10:42,216
You won't believe me if I explain.

737
01:10:42,306 --> 01:10:43,296
Let me guess.

738
01:10:43,426 --> 01:10:44,985
Your wet bum's back.

739
01:10:46,266 --> 01:10:48,143
Except he never left.

740
01:10:49,506 --> 01:10:53,261
Tell him that the ban on noise after
10 pm also applies to him.

741
01:10:55,226 --> 01:10:56,500
I'll tell him.

742
01:11:34,746 --> 01:11:37,386
Weren't we clear?
-It's not me.

743
01:11:37,466 --> 01:11:40,299
I'm not laughing, understood?

744
01:11:48,546 --> 01:11:50,457
That was your last warning.

745
01:13:08,226 --> 01:13:10,183
Honey, I'm home.

746
01:13:12,626 --> 01:13:13,696
Had a good night?

747
01:13:13,786 --> 01:13:16,460
Perfect, drunk on the left, drunk on
the right.

748
01:13:16,586 --> 01:13:18,259
I felt completely at home.

749
01:13:19,866 --> 01:13:21,823
Good that you're making friends
there.

750
01:13:22,506 --> 01:13:26,818
Know where you'll spend your next night?
Especially after your housewarming.

751
01:13:28,186 --> 01:13:29,984
It's going to be very noisy.

752
01:13:30,266 --> 01:13:31,825
Hot water for the shower?

753
01:13:31,906 --> 01:13:34,261
No, sorry.
-No hard feelings.

754
01:13:50,226 --> 01:13:51,625
Stef, really.

755
01:13:51,906 --> 01:13:53,499
I admire your stubbornness.

756
01:13:53,866 --> 01:13:55,425
But it's like kamikaze.

757
01:13:55,546 --> 01:13:57,662
You know what will happen at 10 pm.

758
01:13:57,906 --> 01:14:01,945
Lots of noise, the neighbours will
call the police and you'll go to jail.

759
01:14:02,186 --> 01:14:04,496
And so will all your friends, if
you're lucky.

760
01:14:09,906 --> 01:14:11,817
Liar!

761
01:14:12,906 --> 01:14:14,783
There won't be any friends.

762
01:14:16,986 --> 01:14:19,546
You don't have any friends.

763
01:14:21,586 --> 01:14:22,906
It's a tête-à-tête.

764
01:14:24,026 --> 01:14:26,859
Who's the victim?
Wait, don't say anything.

765
01:14:27,226 --> 01:14:28,341
Your almost ex.

766
01:14:28,826 --> 01:14:30,624
You'll try to win her back.

767
01:14:30,906 --> 01:14:32,943
You'll say something like
"Darling"...

768
01:14:33,506 --> 01:14:34,496
"Sorry."

769
01:14:35,066 --> 01:14:38,377
"Sweetie, Rebecca, it was a mistake.
I really fell into..."

770
01:14:38,546 --> 01:14:40,423
"her cunt by accident."

771
01:14:41,506 --> 01:14:45,500
"I'm sucking up to you because
I want to keep my money."

772
01:14:45,986 --> 01:14:47,624
You look right through me.

773
01:14:48,586 --> 01:14:49,985
Join the club.

774
01:14:53,146 --> 01:14:54,864
Quite romantic, those candles.

775
01:14:55,586 --> 01:14:57,975
Isn't it good that you don't have
electricity?

776
01:15:03,506 --> 01:15:05,736
Shall I play some music?

777
01:15:05,826 --> 01:15:08,818
Not too loud?
-Never before 10 pm.

778
01:15:28,226 --> 01:15:30,502
Man, man.

779
01:15:30,826 --> 01:15:34,023
Natalie will melt in your arms.
I'm telling you.

780
01:15:38,426 --> 01:15:41,066
Unless I ruin it, of course.

781
01:15:42,106 --> 01:15:43,619
I made a reservation here.

782
01:15:45,186 --> 01:15:47,302
First row, expensive seats.

783
01:15:48,466 --> 01:15:50,139
It's worth it.

784
01:16:06,906 --> 01:16:09,182
Why are you wearing a dress?

785
01:16:09,266 --> 01:16:11,826
Because I'll give them all
a blow job, Robin.

786
01:16:13,586 --> 01:16:14,576
Everything ok with you?

787
01:16:15,746 --> 01:16:16,736
Yes.

788
01:16:19,226 --> 01:16:20,216
Is this alright?

789
01:16:21,506 --> 01:16:22,496
It is for me.

790
01:16:36,306 --> 01:16:37,296
For who...

791
01:16:39,386 --> 01:16:40,945
Aren't your friends coming?

792
01:16:47,186 --> 01:16:48,904
Happy birthday, Julie.

793
01:16:49,506 --> 01:16:50,496
How do you know?

794
01:16:51,706 --> 01:16:52,696
Your wallet.

795
01:16:53,826 --> 01:16:55,385
Did you look in my purse?

796
01:16:56,026 --> 01:16:57,016
Unforgiveable, isn't it?

797
01:16:57,946 --> 01:17:01,302
Especially because you spoke the truth,
Julie Valcke.

798
01:17:04,266 --> 01:17:05,256
Open it or not?

799
01:17:06,266 --> 01:17:08,462
You don't have to stay.

800
01:17:10,946 --> 01:17:12,903
Don't stay, Julie. Leave.

801
01:17:14,786 --> 01:17:15,776
Ok.

802
01:17:17,106 --> 01:17:19,541
But if you'll sing Happy Birthday,
I'll be gone.

803
01:17:49,986 --> 01:17:51,897
A bit of improvisation.

804
01:17:56,186 --> 01:17:59,304
I should really sue the previous
owners.

805
01:17:59,386 --> 01:18:02,265
My grandparents sold the house,
not me.

806
01:18:02,506 --> 01:18:05,737
They wanted to sell it quickly after...
-You didn't?

807
01:18:07,186 --> 01:18:08,176
Yes.

808
01:18:09,146 --> 01:18:11,103
Or not, I don't know.

809
01:18:13,826 --> 01:18:15,225
It's strange.

810
01:18:15,786 --> 01:18:18,619
We never used to have electricity
problems.

811
01:18:18,786 --> 01:18:22,302
On the contrary. My father used to be
a maniac about electricity.

812
01:18:22,386 --> 01:18:24,263
Your father, a maniac? Really?

813
01:18:30,746 --> 01:18:32,100
Why are you living alone?

814
01:18:36,066 --> 01:18:37,500
Because I'm divorced.

815
01:18:38,826 --> 01:18:39,816
Why?

816
01:18:42,346 --> 01:18:44,383
I had an affair with a colleague.

817
01:18:44,586 --> 01:18:45,576
Why?

818
01:18:46,426 --> 01:18:47,416
Why?

819
01:18:48,346 --> 01:18:50,257
Didn't you love your wife anymore?

820
01:18:52,946 --> 01:18:53,936
I did.

821
01:18:55,186 --> 01:18:56,381
I don't know why.

822
01:18:56,706 --> 01:18:57,696
Because I could.

823
01:18:59,786 --> 01:19:00,901
Why? Because you could.

824
01:19:02,266 --> 01:19:03,256
Good answer.

825
01:19:04,266 --> 01:19:05,256
And now you're here.

826
01:19:05,386 --> 01:19:06,706
In this big empty house.

827
01:19:07,466 --> 01:19:09,104
Or in your little tent.

828
01:19:13,306 --> 01:19:14,660
Was it worth it?

829
01:19:19,226 --> 01:19:21,183
Do you always ask annoying
questions?

830
01:19:21,306 --> 01:19:22,785
Only to pickpockets.

831
01:19:26,426 --> 01:19:28,099
It wasn't worth it.

832
01:19:30,786 --> 01:19:33,062
But you know what they say.

833
01:19:34,386 --> 01:19:35,785
Repentance always comes too late.

834
01:19:43,266 --> 01:19:44,620
It's my boyfriend.

835
01:19:45,786 --> 01:19:46,776
Ex-boyfriend.

836
01:19:48,746 --> 01:19:50,578
Suddenly, he can't be without me
anymore.

837
01:19:51,466 --> 01:19:52,979
Come on.

838
01:19:54,106 --> 01:19:56,382
Probably because I turned 18 today.

839
01:19:56,866 --> 01:19:59,062
And I got the money from the house.

840
01:19:59,626 --> 01:20:00,616
Really.

841
01:20:09,506 --> 01:20:10,496
Where were we?

842
01:20:11,946 --> 01:20:12,936
Why.

843
01:20:14,866 --> 01:20:17,301
Why don't you say anything
about your father?

844
01:20:23,346 --> 01:20:25,462
I'm not drunk enough yet.

845
01:20:29,066 --> 01:20:30,056
Waiter.

846
01:20:40,946 --> 01:20:44,143
She's had enough.
-You don't need to whisper.

847
01:20:44,226 --> 01:20:45,580
She can't hear you anyway.

848
01:20:47,746 --> 01:20:49,305
She's of age now.

849
01:20:49,626 --> 01:20:51,822
You have no say over her anymore.

850
01:20:53,226 --> 01:20:56,139
There's another reason why you have no
say anymore.

851
01:20:56,306 --> 01:20:57,296
Yes.

852
01:20:57,386 --> 01:20:58,615
You're dead.

853
01:20:59,346 --> 01:21:00,745
What will you do?

854
01:21:02,506 --> 01:21:03,735
I'll listen.

855
01:21:04,586 --> 01:21:06,020
I'll be a shoulder to cry on.

856
01:21:06,906 --> 01:21:08,499
The night's young, Theo.

857
01:21:09,106 --> 01:21:10,744
We'll see what happens.

858
01:21:22,346 --> 01:21:24,383
My dad couldn't live without
my mum.

859
01:21:31,426 --> 01:21:32,416
She's...

860
01:21:32,706 --> 01:21:36,825
A fog, a pile-up, a truck ran over
her car.

861
01:21:41,146 --> 01:21:42,136
I miss her.

862
01:21:42,546 --> 01:21:45,698
Every day. But I can live with
the pain. My dad...

863
01:21:46,426 --> 01:21:47,939
couldn't get over it.

864
01:21:48,066 --> 01:21:50,785
Alcohol, pills, he refused
all help.

865
01:21:55,026 --> 01:21:58,178
Know what he said when I wanted him
to stop?

866
01:22:01,266 --> 01:22:02,256
No.

867
01:22:09,546 --> 01:22:12,140
That I didn't love mum enough.

868
01:22:17,306 --> 01:22:19,536
I went to live with my
grandparents.

869
01:22:19,986 --> 01:22:23,456
And then the cleaning lady found him
here, in the bathtub.

870
01:22:23,906 --> 01:22:25,738
Electrocuted.

871
01:22:26,906 --> 01:22:28,135
That's what did it.

872
01:22:47,586 --> 01:22:48,576
Come.

873
01:23:09,106 --> 01:23:11,382
Was it an accident or suicide?

874
01:23:12,546 --> 01:23:15,060
Nobody was ever able to tell me.

875
01:23:15,666 --> 01:23:19,546
When the house was empty, I asked
the walls. Guess.

876
01:23:20,066 --> 01:23:23,104
I never got an answer, because
I already knew.

877
01:23:23,746 --> 01:23:26,977
Dad didn't think I was worth
staying alive for.

878
01:23:27,386 --> 01:23:28,376
That's not true.

879
01:23:28,946 --> 01:23:30,983
Julie, that's not true.

880
01:23:31,306 --> 01:23:33,024
I didn't love mum enough.

881
01:23:33,746 --> 01:23:35,419
Him probably neither.

882
01:23:35,546 --> 01:23:36,661
The asshole.

883
01:23:38,746 --> 01:23:40,066
That's not true, Julie.

884
01:23:42,506 --> 01:23:43,496
That's not true.

885
01:24:02,386 --> 01:24:03,865
Enough sad stories.

886
01:24:10,226 --> 01:24:11,546
It's my birthday.

887
01:24:12,626 --> 01:24:13,616
Yes.

888
01:24:26,426 --> 01:24:27,416
Shit.

889
01:25:28,426 --> 01:25:29,860
I have another 'why'.

890
01:25:32,066 --> 01:25:34,182
Why did you do this for me?

891
01:25:36,146 --> 01:25:37,261
For your birthday.

892
01:25:40,306 --> 01:25:41,296
And for you.

893
01:25:42,626 --> 01:25:43,616
For me?

894
01:25:49,586 --> 01:25:53,022
Am I the first person you receive here?
Here, now?

895
01:25:53,506 --> 01:25:55,065
In your new house?

896
01:25:58,186 --> 01:25:59,176
Yes.

897
01:26:05,626 --> 01:26:06,616
The first.

898
01:26:07,786 --> 01:26:09,459
What a responsibility.

899
01:26:10,386 --> 01:26:12,184
We should make it memorable.

900
01:26:14,346 --> 01:26:15,336
Because otherwise...

901
01:26:16,826 --> 01:26:17,816
That's the curse.

902
01:26:19,586 --> 01:26:21,941
Otherwise you'll never be happy here.

903
01:26:22,586 --> 01:26:23,576
Never.

904
01:26:37,306 --> 01:26:38,865
I want to stay here.

905
01:26:40,746 --> 01:26:41,736
With you.

906
01:26:43,746 --> 01:26:46,659
I want to feel good one more time in
our house.

907
01:27:00,866 --> 01:27:01,856
Come.

908
01:27:01,946 --> 01:27:03,141
Julie, don't do it.

909
01:27:03,906 --> 01:27:06,182
He's using you. Against me.

910
01:27:06,946 --> 01:27:10,541
Why? Because we could.
And we can now.

911
01:27:17,426 --> 01:27:19,815
Ok, you've won.

912
01:27:19,906 --> 01:27:21,101
Leave her alone.

913
01:27:21,186 --> 01:27:23,416
You wanted a peepshow.
You're getting one.

914
01:27:23,506 --> 01:27:25,702
Don't to it. She's my daughter.

915
01:27:27,786 --> 01:27:28,935
I'll give you the house.

916
01:27:30,786 --> 01:27:31,776
I'll bury myself.

917
01:27:32,586 --> 01:27:35,021
You'll never see me again.
Don't do it.

918
01:27:35,106 --> 01:27:38,656
Sorry, Theo. I think I'll choose
the sex this time.

919
01:27:39,546 --> 01:27:41,457
Julie.

920
01:27:42,986 --> 01:27:43,976
Leave her be.

921
01:28:28,106 --> 01:28:30,177
Did you really think I was going
to do it?

922
01:28:52,066 --> 01:28:53,101
How can you do it to...

923
01:28:53,386 --> 01:28:55,582
such a beautiful woman, such
a great girl...

924
01:28:56,186 --> 01:28:57,176
Your daughter.

925
01:29:00,066 --> 01:29:01,181
Was it an accident?

926
01:29:04,346 --> 01:29:06,701
I don't know anymore.
-Stop lying.

927
01:29:15,346 --> 01:29:16,336
What do you want to hear?

928
01:29:18,426 --> 01:29:19,416
Ok, no.

929
01:29:19,946 --> 01:29:21,141
It wasn't an accident.

930
01:29:22,186 --> 01:29:23,176
There.

931
01:29:24,306 --> 01:29:25,296
I was fed up.

932
01:29:25,466 --> 01:29:28,060
My body was full of pills and
still the pain didn't go away.

933
01:29:30,746 --> 01:29:32,384
The solution was easy.

934
01:29:32,466 --> 01:29:35,265
Pull the radio cable and that's it.

935
01:29:36,866 --> 01:29:39,665
It was like the ring on
a merry-go-round.

936
01:29:40,346 --> 01:29:41,336
It's yours.

937
01:29:41,946 --> 01:29:43,061
You can go again.

938
01:29:44,546 --> 01:29:46,935
Except my merry-go-round kept
on going round.

939
01:29:47,586 --> 01:29:48,656
I can't get off.

940
01:29:48,906 --> 01:29:50,658
I can't go forward or backward.

941
01:29:52,066 --> 01:29:53,420
Not with Anna and not with Julie.

942
01:29:56,026 --> 01:29:57,664
My own version of hell.

943
01:29:59,746 --> 01:30:01,976
That she came here was my only
consolation.

944
01:30:02,706 --> 01:30:03,696
And my torture.

945
01:30:04,146 --> 01:30:06,376
Your daughter's entitled to
the truth.

946
01:30:07,866 --> 01:30:09,425
You can tell her.

947
01:30:12,626 --> 01:30:15,015
And tell her I'm in touch with
her father?

948
01:30:17,066 --> 01:30:18,500
That I'm talking to you?

949
01:30:20,106 --> 01:30:21,665
She'd go nuts.

950
01:30:22,586 --> 01:30:23,860
Or she'd think that I...

951
01:30:27,786 --> 01:30:29,459
We need something better.

952
01:30:30,266 --> 01:30:31,586
Come, think of something.

953
01:30:32,106 --> 01:30:33,221
Be creative.

954
01:30:33,866 --> 01:30:36,506
You have enough inspiration to
annoy me.

955
01:30:39,866 --> 01:30:40,856
A dream.

956
01:30:41,586 --> 01:30:45,580
I appeared to you in a dream and
told you what to say.

957
01:30:45,666 --> 01:30:47,259
Do you think that's a better idea?

958
01:30:47,906 --> 01:30:49,055
Think of something yourself then.

959
01:30:50,386 --> 01:30:52,423
Isn't deceiving people your
specialty?

960
01:30:52,586 --> 01:30:54,623
Lying to Natalie was a piece
of cake.

961
01:31:04,386 --> 01:31:05,376
I've got an idea.

962
01:31:06,866 --> 01:31:09,062
You wrote a farewell letter.

963
01:31:11,146 --> 01:31:12,978
I did not.
-Yes, you did.

964
01:31:13,586 --> 01:31:14,781
You'll do it now.

965
01:31:15,706 --> 01:31:17,902
You wrote a farewell letter...

966
01:31:17,986 --> 01:31:22,298
but nobody's seen it until I moved
in here. I'll give it to her.

967
01:31:23,226 --> 01:31:24,216
Aren't you forgetting something?

968
01:31:26,106 --> 01:31:27,540
She knows my handwriting.

969
01:31:27,626 --> 01:31:28,696
A printed letter.

970
01:31:28,786 --> 01:31:31,062
A file on my PC.
-Not saved.

971
01:31:31,146 --> 01:31:32,580
A printed letter.

972
01:31:33,226 --> 01:31:35,695
And you happened to find it
tonight?

973
01:31:36,506 --> 01:31:40,056
Very unlikely.
-Says someone who's dead.

974
01:31:41,746 --> 01:31:42,736
But you're right.

975
01:31:43,226 --> 01:31:45,183
It's better if she finds it
herself.

976
01:31:47,626 --> 01:31:49,025
I might have an idea.

977
01:31:50,106 --> 01:31:51,141
Don't go away.

978
01:32:05,866 --> 01:32:06,856
Is that yours?

979
01:32:08,746 --> 01:32:10,305
Anna used to collect that.

980
01:32:11,506 --> 01:32:12,860
I hated it.

981
01:32:13,786 --> 01:32:15,015
What will you do with it?

982
01:32:36,066 --> 01:32:37,056
I can't go on.

983
01:32:37,466 --> 01:32:38,456
Very good.

984
01:32:39,146 --> 01:32:40,136
I can't go on.

985
01:32:40,706 --> 01:32:41,696
Julie.

986
01:32:41,826 --> 01:32:43,146
I can't go on like this.

987
01:32:44,426 --> 01:32:45,541
What should I say?

988
01:32:46,586 --> 01:32:47,781
That she's right?

989
01:32:50,226 --> 01:32:51,660
That I was a loser?

990
01:32:53,066 --> 01:32:54,943
A deserter, a drunk jerk?

991
01:32:56,146 --> 01:32:57,216
That will help her.

992
01:32:59,186 --> 01:33:00,381
Don't write that down.

993
01:33:00,466 --> 01:33:01,979
Is it a lie then?

994
01:33:04,146 --> 01:33:05,216
It's useless.

995
01:33:07,826 --> 01:33:09,783
I'd say the wrong things.

996
01:33:10,666 --> 01:33:12,384
I'd continue to hurt her.

997
01:33:13,906 --> 01:33:16,341
That she loved her mum less
than I did.

998
01:33:16,706 --> 01:33:18,060
That's not true.

999
01:33:18,546 --> 01:33:20,025
That was the booze talking.

1000
01:33:22,786 --> 01:33:24,299
What father would say something
like that?

1001
01:33:26,946 --> 01:33:27,936
Julie.

1002
01:33:30,946 --> 01:33:32,903
I thought she was strong enough.

1003
01:33:33,706 --> 01:33:34,696
Stronger than me.

1004
01:33:36,426 --> 01:33:38,224
I couldn't live without Anna.

1005
01:33:38,866 --> 01:33:39,856
And she...

1006
01:33:42,106 --> 01:33:43,699
She was better off without me.

1007
01:33:50,026 --> 01:33:51,505
I'm so sorry, Julie.

1008
01:33:54,466 --> 01:33:55,900
I'm so sorry.

1009
01:33:58,586 --> 01:33:59,576
There.

1010
01:33:59,866 --> 01:34:01,265
Was that so hard?

1011
01:34:03,106 --> 01:34:04,904
Julie, I can't go on like this.

1012
01:34:05,626 --> 01:34:08,379
You're right, I'm a loser... a jerk.

1013
01:34:08,866 --> 01:34:11,335
Useless... the wrong things...

1014
01:34:11,426 --> 01:34:14,418
That I didn't love your mother
isn't true, the booze...

1015
01:34:15,106 --> 01:34:18,815
strong enough, Julie, I'm sorry,
I'm so sorry.

1016
01:34:19,026 --> 01:34:20,016
Daddy.

1017
01:34:21,226 --> 01:34:22,216
Yes.

1018
01:34:22,466 --> 01:34:23,865
I can work with this.

1019
01:34:26,266 --> 01:34:28,257
Theo, a bit...

1020
01:34:35,746 --> 01:34:37,942
Dear Theo. Julie.

1021
01:34:38,026 --> 01:34:40,302
She's entitled to the truth.
I know.

1022
01:34:43,426 --> 01:34:44,621
But she'll hate me so.

1023
01:34:49,946 --> 01:34:51,778
And forever.

1024
01:35:04,426 --> 01:35:07,498
There were also good moments, Stef.
Really.

1025
01:35:11,906 --> 01:35:13,101
Happy moments.

1026
01:35:16,986 --> 01:35:17,976
Before.

1027
01:36:00,426 --> 01:36:01,416
Theo.

1028
01:36:17,826 --> 01:36:19,146
I'm going to wake her up.

1029
01:36:37,626 --> 01:36:38,616
Ok, Theo?

1030
01:36:52,106 --> 01:36:54,780
Inside, go inside!

1031
01:36:54,866 --> 01:36:56,618
Step back!

1032
01:36:57,026 --> 01:36:59,495
It's not the right moment.
-Hands up!

1033
01:37:00,386 --> 01:37:01,376
Other hand.

1034
01:37:02,866 --> 01:37:04,220
Come, tie up.

1035
01:37:08,306 --> 01:37:09,899
Come on!

1036
01:37:10,546 --> 01:37:11,536
Tight.

1037
01:37:12,986 --> 01:37:15,660
I want your car. Where are
your keys?

1038
01:37:17,866 --> 01:37:19,140
In my desk.

1039
01:37:19,626 --> 01:37:20,616
There?
-Yes.

1040
01:37:20,706 --> 01:37:21,855
Ok.

1041
01:37:22,346 --> 01:37:24,462
First, empty your pockets.

1042
01:37:26,786 --> 01:37:28,265
Push them over here.

1043
01:37:33,946 --> 01:37:35,095
Do something.

1044
01:37:35,186 --> 01:37:37,985
What? He'll leave.
-With my car.

1045
01:37:38,826 --> 01:37:39,941
Who are you talking to?

1046
01:37:40,146 --> 01:37:41,136
To myself.

1047
01:37:45,146 --> 01:37:48,104
You can buy a new car, but not
a new life.

1048
01:37:48,186 --> 01:37:51,338
I speak from experience.
-Thanks for caring.

1049
01:37:52,346 --> 01:37:54,940
You need to see a shrink, pal.

1050
01:37:56,146 --> 01:37:57,739
Alright, that Audi.

1051
01:37:57,826 --> 01:38:00,864
Does it have a tracking system?

1052
01:38:00,946 --> 01:38:02,300
No, I don't think so.

1053
01:38:09,186 --> 01:38:12,622
You had to ruin it all!

1054
01:38:12,706 --> 01:38:15,505
A fatso with a great house...

1055
01:38:15,586 --> 01:38:17,259
and an even greater car.

1056
01:38:17,346 --> 01:38:18,700
Did you sleep with her?

1057
01:38:18,786 --> 01:38:19,856
With who?

1058
01:38:19,946 --> 01:38:21,619
Don't bullshit, with Julie!

1059
01:38:21,706 --> 01:38:24,380
Why does he ask that?
-It's none of your business.

1060
01:38:24,946 --> 01:38:27,779
I have the gun.
It is my business.

1061
01:38:28,306 --> 01:38:29,979
I didn't sleep with her.

1062
01:38:30,066 --> 01:38:32,296
I don't believe you.
-Do you sleep with her?

1063
01:38:32,466 --> 01:38:35,697
She's got a birthmark here.
True or not?

1064
01:38:35,786 --> 01:38:37,060
He sleeps with her.

1065
01:38:37,226 --> 01:38:38,580
I don't know.
-Liar!

1066
01:38:38,786 --> 01:38:41,380
I'm not lying.
How can I make you believe me?

1067
01:38:41,706 --> 01:38:44,778
If she had one, I'd deny it.
Or the other way around.

1068
01:38:46,826 --> 01:38:49,386
Man! Wait!
Wait.

1069
01:38:49,546 --> 01:38:51,184
You're not helping.

1070
01:38:51,266 --> 01:38:52,301
Stop it!

1071
01:38:52,386 --> 01:38:53,945
What have you been taking

1072
01:38:54,026 --> 01:38:56,302
My daughter sleeps with a car jacker.

1073
01:38:56,386 --> 01:38:57,376
Stef?

1074
01:39:07,306 --> 01:39:08,899
What are you doing?

1075
01:39:12,946 --> 01:39:13,936
Robin?

1076
01:39:14,226 --> 01:39:15,625
What are you doing?

1077
01:39:15,986 --> 01:39:17,340
What are you doing?

1078
01:39:18,186 --> 01:39:19,699
I know it's you.

1079
01:39:19,786 --> 01:39:21,504
<i>No no, not Robin.</i>

1080
01:39:21,626 --> 01:39:24,903
Don't be a fool. I recognize your
gloves and your shoes.

1081
01:39:25,866 --> 01:39:26,856
Is that my sock?

1082
01:39:28,946 --> 01:39:30,857
Ouch, you're hurting me, Robin!

1083
01:39:30,946 --> 01:39:33,335
The guy from yesterday?
-I don't know.

1084
01:39:35,226 --> 01:39:37,217
Is that the guy from yesterday?

1085
01:39:37,306 --> 01:39:38,421
That's my boyfriend.

1086
01:39:38,546 --> 01:39:39,866
Was my boyfriend.

1087
01:39:40,706 --> 01:39:41,821
What do you want?

1088
01:39:42,146 --> 01:39:43,136
He wants his car.

1089
01:39:43,226 --> 01:39:45,456
He wants his car, my car.

1090
01:39:45,906 --> 01:39:48,978
Robin, what are you doing?
You could end up in jail.

1091
01:39:49,066 --> 01:39:52,775
I'm not Robin and I don't care.
My life's ruined!

1092
01:39:52,866 --> 01:39:54,300
It's his fault!

1093
01:39:54,386 --> 01:39:56,457
I waited all night for you.

1094
01:39:56,586 --> 01:39:58,736
I cooked for your birthday.

1095
01:39:58,826 --> 01:39:59,816
Another one.

1096
01:39:59,906 --> 01:40:01,817
Spaghetti and pancakes.

1097
01:40:02,106 --> 01:40:05,701
That's all you can cook, Robin.

1098
01:40:05,786 --> 01:40:07,743
Sometimes, you want to eat
something else.

1099
01:40:13,506 --> 01:40:17,056
You say 'eat' but you mean 'sex'.

1100
01:40:19,146 --> 01:40:23,140
Yes, yesterday was really three stars.
Stef's a great chef.

1101
01:40:23,226 --> 01:40:24,216
Julie!

1102
01:40:24,306 --> 01:40:25,899
Robin, nothing happened!

1103
01:40:25,986 --> 01:40:27,135
Nothing happened!

1104
01:40:27,226 --> 01:40:29,581
She was upstairs and I was
downstairs.

1105
01:40:29,666 --> 01:40:30,656
In the room.

1106
01:40:30,746 --> 01:40:33,579
She was upstairs in the room.
I was downstairs on the couch.

1107
01:40:42,626 --> 01:40:43,696
How did this get here?

1108
01:40:44,426 --> 01:40:45,860
I found it in the garden house.

1109
01:40:46,546 --> 01:40:47,536
Do you know it?

1110
01:40:47,786 --> 01:40:48,935
It belongs to my mum.

1111
01:40:51,866 --> 01:40:54,335
Do you believe me now?
-It doesn't prove anything.

1112
01:40:55,986 --> 01:40:57,545
Fuck.

1113
01:40:57,666 --> 01:40:59,020
Somebody else.

1114
01:40:59,826 --> 01:41:02,978
Why not? Come in.
We're having open house.

1115
01:41:05,306 --> 01:41:07,024
Inside!

1116
01:41:07,106 --> 01:41:10,462
Inside! Go up those stairs!

1117
01:41:10,546 --> 01:41:12,298
Robin, cut it out!

1118
01:41:12,946 --> 01:41:14,778
No, stay here.

1119
01:41:14,866 --> 01:41:15,856
No.

1120
01:41:15,946 --> 01:41:17,459
Tie her up.

1121
01:41:17,546 --> 01:41:18,536
Yes.

1122
01:41:22,306 --> 01:41:24,297
Ok, who are you?

1123
01:41:24,386 --> 01:41:26,263
My wife.
-Ex-wife.

1124
01:41:27,146 --> 01:41:28,295
Who is she?

1125
01:41:29,066 --> 01:41:30,943
My girlfriend.
-Ex-girlfriend.

1126
01:41:31,306 --> 01:41:32,296
Julie.

1127
01:41:32,746 --> 01:41:33,975
Hey.

1128
01:41:34,106 --> 01:41:35,255
Natalie, nice to meet you.

1129
01:41:35,346 --> 01:41:37,860
I'm Theo, pretend I'm not here.

1130
01:41:37,986 --> 01:41:39,818
Your husband's sleeping with my
girlfriend.

1131
01:41:39,906 --> 01:41:41,943
That doesn't surprise me.

1132
01:41:42,066 --> 01:41:43,056
No, no.

1133
01:41:43,146 --> 01:41:46,457
Julie's not here for you, but for
the house.

1134
01:41:46,586 --> 01:41:48,304
That fucking house!

1135
01:41:48,426 --> 01:41:50,622
That only makes you unhappy.

1136
01:41:50,706 --> 01:41:52,617
I was happy when it sold.

1137
01:41:52,706 --> 01:41:54,265
For yourself, for the money.

1138
01:41:54,346 --> 01:41:55,575
No, for you!

1139
01:41:55,666 --> 01:41:58,465
Yes, maybe to do something good
with the money.

1140
01:41:58,586 --> 01:42:02,375
A snack bar near the station.
I always dreamt of that!

1141
01:42:02,506 --> 01:42:04,497
Or a shop or a trip.

1142
01:42:04,586 --> 01:42:07,783
Or a boat, doesn't matter what.
But far away from here.

1143
01:42:07,866 --> 01:42:11,780
Not what I want, but what you want.
As long as we're together.

1144
01:42:12,306 --> 01:42:13,296
Together with you.

1145
01:42:15,306 --> 01:42:18,219
And you had to ruin it.
-Robin, stop it.

1146
01:42:18,346 --> 01:42:20,781
We did not sleep together.

1147
01:42:21,106 --> 01:42:22,779
I did not sleep with him.

1148
01:42:23,426 --> 01:42:24,416
Really.

1149
01:42:29,586 --> 01:42:30,576
Now untie us.

1150
01:42:30,706 --> 01:42:31,935
Only if you...

1151
01:42:32,226 --> 01:42:35,582
swear you'll forget about
the house and won't come back.

1152
01:42:39,146 --> 01:42:40,181
I can't.

1153
01:42:40,266 --> 01:42:44,055
That ruins you and it ruins me too!
I'll ruin everything!

1154
01:42:44,146 --> 01:42:47,502
If you do that, it'll be over!
I never want to see you again.

1155
01:42:47,666 --> 01:42:48,781
Trash it.

1156
01:42:55,226 --> 01:42:58,935
Then it's all useless.
Come, shoot.

1157
01:42:59,306 --> 01:43:00,944
Straight into my heart.

1158
01:43:01,026 --> 01:43:03,176
I'm already ruined anyway.

1159
01:43:04,106 --> 01:43:06,063
That's your daddy's alarm gun.

1160
01:43:06,266 --> 01:43:07,256
Fuck.

1161
01:43:08,946 --> 01:43:10,459
Pumpkin.

1162
01:43:11,306 --> 01:43:14,139
What am I going to do with you?
-Marry me.

1163
01:43:14,906 --> 01:43:19,423
I looked after you when your father died.
I want to continue to do that.

1164
01:43:20,706 --> 01:43:21,696
Julie...

1165
01:43:22,146 --> 01:43:24,740
there's nothing left for you.
Only sorrow.

1166
01:43:34,466 --> 01:43:35,865
He really cares about her.

1167
01:43:36,586 --> 01:43:37,576
Yes.

1168
01:43:37,666 --> 01:43:38,656
What?

1169
01:43:39,386 --> 01:43:40,706
Nothing.

1170
01:43:47,106 --> 01:43:50,940
No, sorry Julie.
It was really an accident.

1171
01:43:51,066 --> 01:43:52,545
I didn't mean to.

1172
01:43:56,146 --> 01:43:57,466
A note for Anna.

1173
01:43:58,026 --> 01:43:59,016
For Anna?

1174
01:44:00,506 --> 01:44:01,701
That's for your mother.

1175
01:44:06,226 --> 01:44:07,216
You.

1176
01:44:20,346 --> 01:44:21,575
My dearest Anna...

1177
01:44:23,586 --> 01:44:25,623
I miss you so terribly.

1178
01:44:26,346 --> 01:44:28,064
I so want to be with you.

1179
01:44:28,666 --> 01:44:31,897
You don't know how often I almost
did it.

1180
01:44:33,226 --> 01:44:34,580
But I can't.

1181
01:44:35,346 --> 01:44:39,135
I have to stay with Julie.
Can you forgive me?

1182
01:44:40,666 --> 01:44:42,737
I've neglected her so badly.

1183
01:44:43,506 --> 01:44:45,543
I've said things, ugly things.

1184
01:44:45,626 --> 01:44:47,742
Hurtful things that I didn't mean.

1185
01:44:49,066 --> 01:44:50,261
I'm going to make up for that.

1186
01:44:51,826 --> 01:44:53,464
First, I'll clean up the house.

1187
01:44:54,066 --> 01:44:55,977
And I could also use a bath.

1188
01:44:57,186 --> 01:44:58,665
Then I'll look after her.

1189
01:45:00,386 --> 01:45:02,946
So can you wait a bit longer for me,
Anna?

1190
01:45:03,106 --> 01:45:05,985
I promise you I won't get
too old, haha.

1191
01:45:07,106 --> 01:45:09,666
See you later, my wife and my love.
Your Theo.

1192
01:45:36,306 --> 01:45:37,660
Oh yes, sorry.

1193
01:46:48,186 --> 01:46:50,257
Do you think it will change
anything?

1194
01:46:57,386 --> 01:46:58,376
Stef.

1195
01:46:59,266 --> 01:47:00,415
Robin.

1196
01:47:01,266 --> 01:47:02,904
Nice to meet you.

1197
01:47:04,786 --> 01:47:05,776
I think so.

1198
01:47:11,866 --> 01:47:12,856
Here...

1199
01:47:13,586 --> 01:47:15,497
give that back to your dad.

1200
01:47:20,626 --> 01:47:23,937
Can I get my keys back?
-Yes, of course.

1201
01:47:24,586 --> 01:47:25,576
Here you are.

1202
01:47:33,986 --> 01:47:35,545
I'll get my Vespa.

1203
01:47:42,866 --> 01:47:43,856
He's very...

1204
01:47:45,426 --> 01:47:46,655
special.

1205
01:47:47,026 --> 01:47:48,016
Yes.

1206
01:47:48,706 --> 01:47:49,696
Full-time job.

1207
01:48:14,146 --> 01:48:15,136
Natalie.

1208
01:48:17,946 --> 01:48:18,936
I'm still here.

1209
01:48:27,346 --> 01:48:28,336
Strange friends.

1210
01:48:33,866 --> 01:48:35,823
You wrote that letter, didn't you?

1211
01:48:36,986 --> 01:48:38,624
I don't know what you mean.

1212
01:48:41,946 --> 01:48:43,857
Did the house do that to you?

1213
01:48:47,146 --> 01:48:48,136
Want to buy it?

1214
01:48:49,626 --> 01:48:51,105
I'll get it for free.

1215
01:48:53,586 --> 01:48:55,862
That's the lawyer I mentioned.

1216
01:48:55,946 --> 01:48:58,335
A very good one, but I'm better.

1217
01:49:02,386 --> 01:49:05,185
Did you come here just for that?

1218
01:49:07,986 --> 01:49:12,696
I came to say I'll make you suffer
the way you made me suffer.

1219
01:49:14,426 --> 01:49:18,465
When I've had you on your knees long
enough, I might call you one day.

1220
01:49:18,866 --> 01:49:20,777
To have a drink or something.

1221
01:49:22,786 --> 01:49:24,584
My own kind of purgatory.

1222
01:49:24,666 --> 01:49:25,656
What did you say?

1223
01:49:25,906 --> 01:49:26,896
Deal.

1224
01:49:28,786 --> 01:49:30,743
The being on my knees...

1225
01:49:31,906 --> 01:49:33,305
How long does that have to be?

1226
01:49:34,626 --> 01:49:36,742
Let's say two...

1227
01:49:37,826 --> 01:49:39,499
plus another seven months.

1228
01:49:53,426 --> 01:49:54,416
Natalie.

1229
01:49:56,026 --> 01:49:57,016
Natalie.

1230
01:50:02,146 --> 01:50:03,136
Fuck.

1231
01:50:07,386 --> 01:50:08,376
Fuck.

1232
01:50:10,386 --> 01:50:11,376
Theo.

1233
01:50:11,906 --> 01:50:12,896
Theo!

1234
01:50:13,426 --> 01:50:14,905
Did you hear that?

1235
01:50:15,026 --> 01:50:16,175
Theo!

1236
01:50:16,266 --> 01:50:18,416
Are you messing with me?

1237
01:50:19,186 --> 01:50:20,221
Theo!

1238
01:50:20,306 --> 01:50:21,535
Or has he really...

1239
01:50:24,586 --> 01:50:25,576
Theo.

1240
01:50:27,866 --> 01:50:28,856
Theo!

1241
01:50:30,786 --> 01:50:31,776
Theo!

1242
01:50:35,186 --> 01:50:36,176
Theo!
