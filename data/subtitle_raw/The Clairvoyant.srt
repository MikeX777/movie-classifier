00:00:28,267 --> 00:00:31,200

00:00:31,267 --> 00:00:39,200

00:01:58,067 --> 00:02:01,067

00:02:08,067 --> 00:02:10,933
(Seagulls squawking)

7
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,133
Uh, excuse me, sir.
What?

8
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,067
Oh, I... I beg
your pardon.

9
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:27,733
What have I here, dear?

10
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:33,233
Uh, "what have I
here, dear?"

11
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,367
(Ship's horn blowing)

12
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:36,467
Come on, big brain,
let's hear from you.

13
00:02:36,533 --> 00:02:38,800
Excuse me, sailor.

14
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:42,667
"What have I here,
dear" means...

15
00:02:42,733 --> 00:02:43,867
A cigarette case.

16
00:02:43,933 --> 00:02:45,600
Wrong again, professor.

17
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:46,833
I suppose you know

18
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,367
We're starting this act
tomorrow night.

19
00:02:48,433 --> 00:02:51,267
I hope, sweet angel, it
means a cigarette case.

20
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,100
It means a fountain pen,
nitwit.

21
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:55,333
Darling, you're a liar.
Thank you, professor.

22
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,767
Well, you gave me
the wrong cue.

23
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:57,967
That's right...
Put me in the wrong.

24
00:02:58,067 --> 00:02:59,467
I never argue
with a lady.

25
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:02,700
I'm not a lady...
I'm your wife.
Yep.

26
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:07,067
"What have I here,
dear" means, uh...

27
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:08,433
Oh, a fountain pen.

28
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,433
Oh, yes.

29
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,067
Well, let's try again,
professor.

30
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,267
What am I holding?
Uh...

31
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:16,467
Uh-uh, that's cheating.

32
00:03:16,533 --> 00:03:17,500
Well, if you don't
trust me,

33
00:03:17,567 --> 00:03:18,633
I should get a divorce.

34
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,067
"Judge, my wife
didn't trust me."

35
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,067
One of these days, I
shall have you destroyed.

36
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,233
Oh, that'd be nice.

37
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,367
So now what?

38
00:03:25,433 --> 00:03:27,933
So now,
what am I holding?

39
00:03:28,067 --> 00:03:31,467
Uh, uh... darling,

40
00:03:31,533 --> 00:03:34,633
Do you by any chance
happen to remember,

41
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,600
The exact day when
we were married?

42
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:38,367
Don't change the subject.

43
00:03:38,433 --> 00:03:40,867
Well, you see, uh,
what I wanted to say was,

44
00:03:40,933 --> 00:03:42,933
Since next April
is going to be

45
00:03:43,067 --> 00:03:46,067
One of our anniversaries,
that I might go out

46
00:03:46,067 --> 00:03:48,633
And buy you a nice
big Christmas tree.

47
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,967
What am I holding?

48
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:51,167
You're holding a box
of chocolates.

49
00:03:51,233 --> 00:03:52,333
Wrong.
Right.

50
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,467
Right, Miss Know-It-All.
Wrong.

51
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:54,467
Prove it with the book.

52
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:56,467
Go on, prove it.

53
00:03:56,533 --> 00:03:58,800
Oh, well...

54
00:03:58,867 --> 00:04:00,700
What were you saying
about our anniversary?

55
00:04:00,767 --> 00:04:01,967
What am I holding?

56
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:04,067
What am I holding,
you darling, you?

57
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,633
You darling.

58
00:04:11,533 --> 00:04:12,900
I say, where's Mother?

59
00:04:12,967 --> 00:04:14,433
Mother!

60
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,633
Mother!

61
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,667
Dear, don't we
have a porter?
What for?

62
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:21,467
Remember, a fool and his
money are soon parted.

63
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:23,300
Yes, and you remember...

64
00:04:23,367 --> 00:04:26,067
(Muffled)

65
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,067
Oh!

66
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,233
There they are!

67
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,233
(Overlapping chatter)

68
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:37,233
Could I help?

69
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,800
Put it on there.

70
00:04:38,867 --> 00:04:40,300
Well, Simon, I see
you've got everything.

71
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:41,933
I have everything in
the world, I should think.

72
00:04:42,067 --> 00:04:43,067
Let's go.

73
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:44,067
Come on,
you're wasting time.

74
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,467
Come on.

75
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:55,700
(Overlapping chatter)

76
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,067
Now, madam, have you anything
to declare?
I have not.

77
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,067
No.
Cigarettes?

78
00:05:02,067 --> 00:05:03,067
Cigars?
No.

79
00:05:03,067 --> 00:05:04,067
No.
Cameras?

80
00:05:04,067 --> 00:05:05,167
Perfumes?
No, no, no.

81
00:05:05,233 --> 00:05:07,533
Open this bag, please.

82
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,200
Have you anything
to declare, sir?

83
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,867
Uh, oh, no,
thank you, no.

84
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:13,067
Here's a pretty thing.

85
00:05:13,067 --> 00:05:14,433
What is it?
Pretty thing.

86
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,133
That's, um,
a powder compact.

87
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,300
Right, darling.

88
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:19,133
Will you open this
suitcase, please, sir?

89
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,767
No cigars, cigarettes,
cameras, or perfumes?

90
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:25,367
No perfumes.

91
00:05:25,433 --> 00:05:26,933
Now, what have we
got here?

92
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:28,867
"What have we
got here?"

93
00:05:28,933 --> 00:05:30,933
That's, uh...
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

94
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:33,500
A bottle of whiskey.
Eh? Where?

95
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,800
Oh, I beg your pardon,
I didn't mean that.

96
00:05:35,867 --> 00:05:37,600
There isn't one.
You said there was.

97
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:39,933
Yes, well, you see,

98
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:42,333
You said to me,
"What have we got here?"

99
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,300
And the answer to that
is "a bottle of whiskey."

100
00:05:44,367 --> 00:05:45,800
You see?
Yes.
(Laughs)

101
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:48,267
No, I'm afraid I don't.

102
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:51,267
Well, where is it?
Yes, but you don't understand.

103
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,633
I mean, it's a...
It's a gag.

104
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,467
Yeah, seems like it.

105
00:05:54,533 --> 00:05:56,267
Open this case,
will you, please?

106
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,200
Yes, but listen to me.

107
00:05:58,267 --> 00:06:01,067
I'm the great Maximus.
Yes, very likely you are.

108
00:06:01,067 --> 00:06:03,333
Last week, we had a man here
who said he was Napoleon,

109
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,633
But that doesn't alter the fact
that whiskey is dutiable.

110
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,967
Yes, but you
don't understand.

111
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:08,567
We're a music hall turn.

112
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:10,067
We're just starting
on a tour.

113
00:06:10,067 --> 00:06:11,400
I'm a mind reader.

114
00:06:11,467 --> 00:06:12,900
Yes, that's what I
have to be too,

115
00:06:12,967 --> 00:06:14,767
And I'm going to
find that whiskey

116
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,533
If I have to search
all night for it.

117
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,267
Put that in your mind
and read it.

118
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,467
There you are, Max.

119
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:21,300
I told you this new act
would cause trouble.

120
00:06:21,367 --> 00:06:22,667
You should be
like your father.

121
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:24,167
Stick to the old routines.

122
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:25,933
The proof of the
pudding's in the eating.

123
00:06:26,067 --> 00:06:28,633
(Whistle blowing)

124
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,100
Here, look here,
my man.

125
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:31,933
We shall miss our train!
Yes!

126
00:06:32,067 --> 00:06:34,167
Ah, are you with
this gentleman?

127
00:06:34,233 --> 00:06:35,333
Well, I...
Yes, he is.

128
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,200
Right, well, come on,
open up this case.

129
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:40,067
Anything to declare?
No.

130
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,533
No.
No perfumes?

131
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,067
No cameras?
No.

132
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,733
No.
No cigarettes?

133
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,300
No cigars?
No.

134
00:06:48,767 --> 00:06:51,833
Oh, nothing to declare, eh?
No.

135
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,900
Cigars!
No cigars?

136
00:06:54,967 --> 00:06:58,133
Well, what about this?
Here, here, don't open that!

137
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,733
What do you think I am?

138
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,367
It's a trick!
Yeah.

139
00:07:01,433 --> 00:07:03,133
Like his disappearing
whiskey, I suppose.

140
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,400
Aw, please, it took me
two hours to pack that.

141
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,267
Oh, did it? Well...
Aah!

142
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,933
(Laughter)

143
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,733
Ladies and gentlemen,

144
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,767
It is
with great pleasure

145
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:39,167
That I present to you
the greatest mindreading

146
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:41,133
And thought stunt
special act

147
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,167
That has ever appeared
before the public!

148
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:45,400
Dear, dear, dear, dear!
Oh,
now don't you worry, mother.

149
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:46,733
Everything's gonna
be all right.

150
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,233
Max, stick to the old tricks,
just as your dad did.

151
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,133
Remember, fools rush in
where angels fear to tread.

152
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,367
Yes, but nothing ventured,
nothing half-topsy.

153
00:07:52,433 --> 00:07:53,500
Now, will you please
put that table

154
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:54,600
On the other side
of the stage?

155
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:55,600
I've asked you to
twice.

156
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:56,767
Put it on the blue
mark, will you?

157
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:57,833
Professor.
Yes?

158
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,967
Can you tell me
what it is?

159
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:00,300
It is a lipstick,
darling.

160
00:08:00,367 --> 00:08:02,100
How do I look?
You look lovely, my sweet.

161
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:03,267
Do you think you can
remember everything?

162
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,733
Well, that's good,
coming from you, anyway.

163
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,933
Max, I have to warn you,
if anything should happen...

164
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:07,067
Will you please
go away?

165
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,067
Mr. Maximus, please.
Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!

166
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:11,733
(Emcee)
I have the pleasure of
introducing to you

167
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,133
The great Maximus!

168
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,567
(Applause)

169
00:08:16,633 --> 00:08:20,767
I will introduce to you
Mademoiselle Rene,

170
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,700
Who will come down
amongst you.

171
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:23,733
(Applause)

172
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,567
I ask you to test

173
00:08:25,633 --> 00:08:28,667
The miraculous powers
of this marvelous pair

174
00:08:28,733 --> 00:08:32,300
And to see for yourselves
the most perfect example

175
00:08:32,367 --> 00:08:34,500
Of telepathetic
communication

176
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:36,600
The world
has ever known!

177
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:39,133
(Applause)

178
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,233
Ladies and gentlemen,
all the best tricks,

179
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,400
Like all the best things
in life, are simple,

180
00:08:46,467 --> 00:08:48,600
Though sometimes hard
to explain.

181
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:50,933
I do not profess
to be a superman.

182
00:08:51,067 --> 00:08:52,833
The powers I possess

183
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,433
Are possessed, more or less,
by you all.

184
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,367
Mademoiselle Rene
is among you.

185
00:08:59,433 --> 00:09:05,100
She will ask you to pass her
any small personal article.

186
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:08,200
The waves of thought
emanating from her

187
00:09:08,267 --> 00:09:10,333
Will come across
the footlights to me.

188
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,833
To put it simply,

189
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,433
It will be as if
Mademoiselle Rene

190
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,700
Were my own
electric battery,

191
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:18,600
Motivating the force

192
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:21,767
Which gives me the power to
retransmit to you

193
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:25,100
My knowledge of
what is in her mind,

194
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:29,067
And, by the hidden mysteries
of the powers of thought,

195
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:32,467
I will describe the object
she is holding.

196
00:09:32,533 --> 00:09:38,833
(Applause)

197
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,467
(Rene)
Any articles,
ladies and gentlemen.

198
00:09:40,533 --> 00:09:42,133
Any personal articles.

199
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,133
You, sir?
What about you?

200
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,200
No? Really?

201
00:09:45,267 --> 00:09:47,200
You, miss. Perhaps
you have something.

202
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:50,133
Ah, yes, the young
lady has something.

203
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,533
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

204
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,500
Are you ready?
Absolutely, mademoiselle.

205
00:09:55,567 --> 00:09:58,067
I have a very
charming thing here.

206
00:09:58,133 --> 00:10:00,300
Can you tell me
what it is?

207
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:02,767
It is...

208
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,367
A lipstick.

209
00:10:04,433 --> 00:10:06,067
Got the first one
right, anyway.

210
00:10:06,133 --> 00:10:07,967
Oh, that's beautiful.

211
00:10:08,033 --> 00:10:10,967
May I?
Thank you very much.

212
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,600
I should like you
to tell me

213
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:16,100
What I have now.

214
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:18,600
What you have now...

215
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:20,233
Is a tiepin.

216
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,933
(Applause)

217
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,300
He's getting them
all right.

218
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:26,700
Yes, but there's many a slip
twixt the cup and the lip.

219
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:30,600
Miss, ask him to tell you
what this is.

220
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:33,700
Any personal articles,
ladies and gentlemen?

221
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:34,933
Anything you please.

222
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,233
Impressed there's one
that's a bit unusual.

223
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,700
Oh, I'm sure you'd
like the great Maximus

224
00:10:38,767 --> 00:10:39,800
To tell you what this is.

225
00:10:39,867 --> 00:10:40,867
Yes.

226
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:42,967
What have I
this time?

227
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:44,933
(Max)
That, mademoiselle,
is a watch.

228
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,800
A wristwatch.
There you are.

229
00:10:47,867 --> 00:10:50,367
"Time." Watch.
See?

230
00:10:50,433 --> 00:10:53,167
And now,
Mademoiselle Rene

231
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:54,633
Will repeat
her performance

232
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,433
For the benefit of the
ladies and gentlemen

233
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,800
In the dressed circle.

234
00:10:58,867 --> 00:10:59,900
Here, that's
all very well,

235
00:11:00,067 --> 00:11:01,100
But what about this?

236
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:03,367
(People shouting)

237
00:11:03,433 --> 00:11:05,433
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

238
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:13,433
(Applause)

239
00:11:19,233 --> 00:11:21,367
(Door rattling)

240
00:11:21,433 --> 00:11:28,067
(Overlapping chatter)

241
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,700
I suppose she knows
her way.

242
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,800
How do I get up
to the circle?

243
00:11:34,867 --> 00:11:36,267
Around the front.

244
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,633
Ticket office,
facing...

245
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,633
But I don't want
a ticket.

246
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,633
I'm part of the show.

247
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,867
You mean you're
one of the artists?

248
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,433
Yes, can't you see
my makeup?

249
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,267
Artists aren't allowed in
front without permission.

250
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,133
I've got permission,
and the stage is waiting.

251
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,900
Well, you'll have to
ask the manager

252
00:11:48,967 --> 00:11:50,100
At the ticket office.

253
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,100
Why can't I go
through this way?

254
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,133
'Cause it doesn't lead
to the circle.

255
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,300
Well, will you
please tell me

256
00:11:54,367 --> 00:11:56,067
How I can get up
to the circle?

257
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:58,233
Is Mademoiselle Rene
up there yet?

258
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,867
No, she's not here!
She's left us!

259
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:02,800
(Overlapping chatter)

260
00:12:02,867 --> 00:12:04,500
Where's the old girl
gone to?

261
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:07,167
(Laughter)

262
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:09,067
Hey, what have I
got here?

263
00:12:09,133 --> 00:12:11,433
It's a pipe!

264
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,900
A pipe!

265
00:12:12,967 --> 00:12:14,633
(Overlapping chatter)

266
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,267
(Man shouting)

267
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:23,267
(Laughter)

268
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,700
(Whistling)

269
00:12:25,767 --> 00:12:30,067
(Applause)

270
00:12:30,133 --> 00:12:32,900
(Rhythmic clapping)

271
00:12:32,967 --> 00:12:35,700
(Laughter)

272
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:38,433
(Whistling)

273
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:43,900
(Rhythmic clapping)

274
00:12:43,967 --> 00:12:46,467
What's wrong?

275
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:49,333
(Whistling)

276
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,833
(Rhythmic clapping)

277
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,367
(Applause)

278
00:12:55,433 --> 00:13:01,933
(Rhythmic clapping)

279
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:05,200
Go on!
Go ahead, go ahead!

280
00:13:05,267 --> 00:13:06,500
(Rhythmic clapping)

281
00:13:06,567 --> 00:13:09,667
(Whistling)

282
00:13:09,733 --> 00:13:13,800
(Rhythmic clapping)

283
00:13:13,867 --> 00:13:16,467
Just that, just that.

284
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:18,367
He calls himself
a mind-reader.

285
00:13:18,433 --> 00:13:19,600
(Laughter)

286
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:20,833
What have I got here?

287
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,067
It's a letter.

288
00:13:23,133 --> 00:13:26,333
What's it about?

289
00:13:27,767 --> 00:13:29,467
From your wife.

290
00:13:29,533 --> 00:13:31,200
Well, that's where
you're wrong.

291
00:13:31,267 --> 00:13:33,067
(Laughter)

292
00:13:33,133 --> 00:13:35,300
About your wife.

293
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:36,533
What did he say?

294
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,433
He said it was
about your wife.

295
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,733
Well, he's right.

296
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,500
It's from a hospital.

297
00:13:45,567 --> 00:13:49,667
That letter
is two days old.

298
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:54,367
You'd better go
to your wife.

299
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,167
Don't tell me
she's worse.

300
00:14:05,467 --> 00:14:08,667
Excuse me, will you?

301
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:15,467
This isn't the act
they rehearsed.

302
00:14:15,533 --> 00:14:17,567
I know what it is.

303
00:14:20,567 --> 00:14:22,367
And you...

304
00:14:23,733 --> 00:14:25,733
I see...

305
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:29,100
A railway journey.

306
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:31,600
(Dramatic music)

307
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:33,133
I see...

308
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,633
**

309
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,967
I see...

310
00:14:38,067 --> 00:14:39,233
(Audience murmuring)

311
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,233
Ring down!

312
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:46,467
(Audience murmuring)

313
00:14:46,533 --> 00:14:49,067
Max, are you all right?

314
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,300
(Overlapping chatter)

315
00:14:52,367 --> 00:14:57,433
(Audience murmuring)

316
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,367
Max!

317
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:01,067
My God!

318
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,300
What's the matter?

319
00:15:02,367 --> 00:15:04,300
(Audience murmuring)

320
00:15:04,367 --> 00:15:09,333
(Groaning)

321
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:21,467
Rene?

322
00:15:21,533 --> 00:15:24,267
Re... Rene.

323
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:28,800
Oh, Max, what
happened to you?

324
00:15:28,867 --> 00:15:30,933
I don't know.

325
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,800
I don't know.

326
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:35,633
I know.

327
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,633
My father had it...
The gift to see.

328
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:44,100
(Train whistle blowing)

329
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:54,467
Take your seats, please,
for the first dinner service.

330
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:55,633
(Bell ringing)

331
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,433
First dinner service.

332
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,300
Please take your seats.

333
00:15:59,367 --> 00:16:01,067
(Bell ringing)

334
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,267
Well, it may have been
real clairvoyance,

335
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,700
But how can you be sure?

336
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:10,633
Anyway,
I think it's dangerous.

337
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,200
Don't worry, my sweet.

338
00:16:12,267 --> 00:16:13,567
It only happened once.

339
00:16:13,633 --> 00:16:15,700
It hasn't
happened since.

340
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:19,767
It may never
happen again.

341
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:20,933
I hope it does.

342
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:23,467
We'll make
our fortunes.

343
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:26,067
These things come and go.
No one knows why.

344
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:29,233
Perhaps there was someone
in the theater, Max,

345
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,233
In sympathy with you.

346
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,133
Sort of, um,
sort of...

347
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,267
You know, like you
say in the act...

348
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,833
Sort of a battery to
your wireless receiver.

349
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,300
That's it.

350
00:16:38,367 --> 00:16:40,800
Now I'll be
a clairvoyant.

351
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:42,733
This being
an English railway,

352
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,933
The menu will be
tomato soup,

353
00:16:45,067 --> 00:16:48,933
Roast beef, apple tarts,
seasoned biscuits, coffee...

354
00:16:49,067 --> 00:16:50,167
Ha ha.

355
00:16:50,233 --> 00:16:51,167
(Laughs)

356
00:16:51,233 --> 00:16:52,200
Now, Mr. Prophet,

357
00:16:52,267 --> 00:16:53,933
You show your skill.

358
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:56,733
What about Blue Boy
for the 2:30 tomorrow?

359
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,533
I'm supposed to be
a clairvoyant,

360
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,067
Not a tipster.

361
00:17:00,133 --> 00:17:02,467
Oh, not much good
foreseeing the future

362
00:17:02,533 --> 00:17:04,067
If you can't double
the dough.

363
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,067
Never count your chickens
before they're hatched.

364
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:10,400
Talking of chickens,
what about this one?

365
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:20,733
(Train whistle blowing)

366
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,133
I've seen that girl
before.

367
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,633
That girl?

368
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:29,067
Yes, right over...

369
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,067
That girl.

370
00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:39,100
A journey.

371
00:17:42,233 --> 00:17:46,800
(Brakes screeching)

372
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:59,833
(Overlapping chatter)

373
00:18:04,967 --> 00:18:07,400
Did you pull that
communication cord?

374
00:18:07,467 --> 00:18:10,200
This train will not
get to a station.

375
00:18:10,267 --> 00:18:11,800
There will be an accident.

376
00:18:11,867 --> 00:18:13,767
Accident?
What do you mean?

377
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:16,300
Excuse me, sir.
Darling, don't worry.

378
00:18:16,367 --> 00:18:19,067
This is a very serious
kind of a joke, isn't it?

379
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:21,700
Oh!

380
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,233
If it's advertisement
you're after,

381
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,933
You'll get all you want
in the police court.

382
00:18:25,067 --> 00:18:27,967
There's a penalty of £5
for this sort of thing.

383
00:18:28,067 --> 00:18:29,933
I advise everybody
to get off this train.

384
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,400
What for?
I've told you once.

385
00:18:31,467 --> 00:18:32,767
Excuse me, guard.

386
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,800
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,
do take your seats, please.

387
00:18:34,867 --> 00:18:36,700
Take your seats.
Mother, Simon.

388
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:44,700
(Overlapping chatter)

389
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,400
Now, come along,
everybody.

390
00:18:52,467 --> 00:18:53,600
Get aboard again, please.

391
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:55,967
You don't realize we've
stopped in a tunnel.

392
00:18:56,067 --> 00:18:57,500
I tell you to warn
the rest of the passengers

393
00:18:57,567 --> 00:18:58,667
To get off the train.

394
00:18:58,733 --> 00:19:01,233
Are you coming aboard?
No, I'm not.

395
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,233
Very well, you'll stay here
on your own responsibility.

396
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,867
Aye, you with the lamp.

397
00:19:05,933 --> 00:19:08,067
Gather these people out
of the tunnel, will you?

398
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,300
Why'd you let them
off the train?

399
00:19:09,367 --> 00:19:12,967
Now, don't argue!
Look after these people!

400
00:19:13,067 --> 00:19:16,267
Now, stand clear, please!

401
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,467
(Whistle blowing)

402
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,067
(Engine starting)

403
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,600
Stand clear there,
please!

404
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,300
Here, let's get
out of this.

405
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:41,300
Come on, then, before
the next train comes through.

406
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,600
Hey, what are you
doing on the track?

407
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:00,867
I just got off
the train.

408
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,133
You mean
the Manchester train?

409
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,967
Yes, he stopped it.

410
00:20:04,033 --> 00:20:09,367
(Ringing)

411
00:20:09,433 --> 00:20:12,933
Hello, hello?

412
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,700
What?

413
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,767
Where?

414
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,933
How'd it happen?

415
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,267
There's been a smash.
Oh!

416
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:28,400
Max!

417
00:20:28,467 --> 00:20:29,900
I've closed the section.

418
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:32,767
Excuse me, can I use
the phone?
No, no.

419
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,000
I want to speak
to my father.

420
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,067
Oh, use that one then.

421
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:37,033
Can you see the smash?
Hello?

422
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,933
Hello?
Is it bad?

423
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,067
40?
Can you give me
a London number?

424
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:45,600
How many of them?
Peak 9000.

425
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:46,767
Yes, The Daily Sun.

426
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,300
Here, none of your
newspaper stuff!

427
00:20:48,367 --> 00:20:49,800
Here I thought you wanted
to speak to your father.

428
00:20:49,867 --> 00:20:52,700
I do... he's the owner
of the paper.

429
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:54,800
Hello, Christine, dear.

430
00:20:54,867 --> 00:20:56,100
How are you?

431
00:20:56,167 --> 00:21:01,367
Uh... good heavens.

432
00:21:01,433 --> 00:21:04,133
Wait a moment.

433
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,200
Hello, assignments,
hold your front page.

434
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:09,433
You'll probably have to
set it up again.

435
00:21:23,067 --> 00:21:24,067
(Knocks)

436
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,067
Excuse me, please.

437
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,400
(Knocks)

438
00:21:30,533 --> 00:21:33,200
I've never seen so many
cars in all my life.

439
00:21:33,267 --> 00:21:34,367
(Knocks on door)

440
00:21:34,433 --> 00:21:35,800
Never mind the cars.

441
00:21:35,867 --> 00:21:37,333
They'll have my front door
in with their knocking.

442
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,767
I think it's an outrage.

443
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:39,867
I should think so.

444
00:21:39,933 --> 00:21:41,167
What's an outrage,
Simon?

445
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,567
These newspapermen
have spelled my name wrong.

446
00:21:43,633 --> 00:21:44,633
You should
be very pleased

447
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,633
To have your name
on the front page

448
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,867
At your time of life.

449
00:21:46,933 --> 00:21:48,233
What do you mean,
my time of life?

450
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,667
If you please.

451
00:21:49,733 --> 00:21:51,100
Now, old man,
what are you doing here?

452
00:21:51,167 --> 00:21:52,633
Must you do that?

453
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,833
I'm sorry, Mr. Bimeter.

454
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,267
Thank you,
I certainly am.

455
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,867
(Knocks)

456
00:21:58,933 --> 00:22:02,633
And thick and fast
they came at last,

457
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,333
And more and more and more.

458
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,433
(Knocks on door)

459
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,467
Hello, Maxie.

460
00:22:07,533 --> 00:22:08,867
I'll have to
let them in.

461
00:22:08,933 --> 00:22:10,433
Mr. Maximus is not
going to see anyone

462
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,667
Until after breakfast.

463
00:22:11,733 --> 00:22:12,733
(Knocks on door)

464
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,933
It isn't his
front door.

465
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:15,733
And please see you don't
burn his omelet.

466
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,833
I won't burn
his omelet.

467
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,500
Mr. Rupert Boddy,
Variety.

468
00:22:19,567 --> 00:22:22,767
Mr. Sam Leopold.
He's a London manager.

469
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:24,133
Mr. Joseph Leman.

470
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,367
Mr. Claude Simmons.

471
00:22:25,433 --> 00:22:26,367
You know, Max will offend
some of these people

472
00:22:26,433 --> 00:22:28,067
If he doesn't see them.

473
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,900
Ah!

474
00:22:29,967 --> 00:22:32,400
Here's a man
who really matters.

475
00:22:32,467 --> 00:22:34,067
James J. Bimeter.

476
00:22:34,133 --> 00:22:35,733
Bimeter?
Mm.

477
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,467
J.R. Copeland's
representative.

478
00:22:37,533 --> 00:22:39,100
You can't keep him
waiting.

479
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:40,667
(Knocks on door)

480
00:22:40,733 --> 00:22:42,900
At last.
They'll break
my door down!

481
00:22:42,967 --> 00:22:44,133
All the big bucks
in the variety business

482
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,133
Are waiting for you.

483
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
Let them wait.

484
00:22:46,267 --> 00:22:47,633
But J.J. Bimeter's
amongst them.

485
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,933
I once waited five hours
for Mr. Bimeter,

486
00:22:50,067 --> 00:22:51,233
And then he slipped out
the back door.

487
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,633
And now he's waiting
at your front door.

488
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,667
I'm in no mood
for business today!

489
00:22:54,733 --> 00:22:56,933
Mrs. Jones, show
Mr. Bimeter in.

490
00:22:57,067 --> 00:22:58,267
And what have I here?
Hey!

491
00:22:58,333 --> 00:22:59,300
A baggage.

492
00:22:59,367 --> 00:23:00,500
Don't drop me,
I'm not insured.

493
00:23:00,567 --> 00:23:01,667
I want to talk
business, madam.

494
00:23:01,733 --> 00:23:03,600
Your bath is ready.
Oh, let it wait.

495
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:05,067
We'll not only go,
and quickly too.

496
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,100
Farewell,
and scrub thyself.

497
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:07,100
I want to meet
Mr. Bimeter.

498
00:23:07,167 --> 00:23:10,300
(Overlapping chatter)

499
00:23:10,367 --> 00:23:13,333
Oh...

500
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,767
Good morning.

501
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:19,500
May I present my wife?

502
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:20,733
How do you do?

503
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,100
I was just on my way
to the bath.

504
00:23:25,167 --> 00:23:27,567
Excuse me.

505
00:23:27,633 --> 00:23:29,467
Good morning.

506
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,067
You've probably
heard of me.

507
00:23:31,133 --> 00:23:32,967
I'm James J. Bimeter.

508
00:23:33,067 --> 00:23:35,500
The Mr. Bimeter?
Quite.

509
00:23:35,567 --> 00:23:37,500
Won't you come in?

510
00:23:38,733 --> 00:23:40,833
My partner.
How are you, sir?

511
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,567
My lady mother,
the duchess.

512
00:23:42,633 --> 00:23:45,600
How do you do?
How do you do?

513
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:48,567
Won't you sit down?
Thank you, thank you.

514
00:23:48,633 --> 00:23:51,133
I, uh... I happened
to be in Manchester,

515
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,667
And I received a call
from Mr. Coben.

516
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:56,733
Which Mr. Coben?

517
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,767
The Mr. Coben.

518
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:00,500
Well, to come
straight to business,

519
00:24:00,567 --> 00:24:03,233
Mr. Coben was impressed
by your, uh,

520
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,267
Shall we say, uh,
performance

521
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:07,733
In prophesying the Manchester
train accident,

522
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,867
And he's going to
give you £100 a week

523
00:24:09,933 --> 00:24:12,067
For four weeks at
the London Palindrome.

524
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,200
How much?
£100?

525
00:24:13,267 --> 00:24:14,200
He didn't
say 100.

526
00:24:14,267 --> 00:24:16,067
He did, but it
isn't enough.

527
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,067
What?
What are you
saying, Max?

528
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,133
Max!

529
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,567
You may thank Mr. Coben
for the offer,

530
00:24:19,633 --> 00:24:20,800
But I'm not
in the market.

531
00:24:20,867 --> 00:24:22,133
You mean to say you
ought to get more?

532
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,300
I mean that the effort
of true clairvoyance

533
00:24:24,367 --> 00:24:26,800
Is infinitely fatiguing.

534
00:24:26,867 --> 00:24:29,467
Max, you're getting
£30 a week at present.

535
00:24:29,533 --> 00:24:31,233
I want 300.

536
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,700
Good morning.
Good morning.

537
00:24:33,767 --> 00:24:36,933
Ah, Mr. Sam Leopold.

538
00:24:37,067 --> 00:24:39,067
Leopold can't pay more
than Mr. Coben.

539
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,067
We'll see.

540
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,067
Simon,
show Mr. Leopold in.

541
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,433
Just a moment.

542
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,867
I'll make it 150.

543
00:24:43,933 --> 00:24:46,267
Uh, good morning.

544
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:47,600
200.

545
00:24:47,667 --> 00:24:49,667
"Will you walk
into my parlor?"

546
00:24:49,733 --> 00:24:51,133
Said the spider
to the fly.

547
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,300
You're not worth
a penny more.

548
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:53,367
Mr. Dick Crow.

549
00:24:53,433 --> 00:24:55,233
Simon, show
Mr. Crow in too.

550
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,267
I'll make it 250.
300.

551
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:58,700
You're looney.
It's money for jam.

552
00:24:58,767 --> 00:25:00,300
250?
300.

553
00:25:00,367 --> 00:25:02,067
It can't be done.
You're sure?

554
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:03,433
Certain!
We'll see.

555
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,067
Where are you going?
To get a second opinion.

556
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,467
My opinion is
the only one you want.

557
00:25:06,533 --> 00:25:10,067
Let me tell...
You tell him, not me.

558
00:25:10,067 --> 00:25:12,933
Anything the matter
with him?

559
00:25:13,067 --> 00:25:14,933
Ah, gentlemen!

560
00:25:15,067 --> 00:25:17,133
I am offered £250 a week.

561
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,833
Any advance on 250?

562
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,600
Going, going...

563
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:21,667
Swollen head.

564
00:25:21,733 --> 00:25:22,967
That's what's
the matter with him.

565
00:25:23,067 --> 00:25:24,267
£300.

566
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:25,400
Who does he thing
he is?

567
00:25:25,467 --> 00:25:26,800
I've been in this
business for 25...

568
00:25:26,867 --> 00:25:28,333
What?
You still here?

569
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,567
Well, did you
see them?

570
00:25:29,633 --> 00:25:30,567
All of them.

571
00:25:30,633 --> 00:25:33,967
What did they
offer... 250?

572
00:25:34,067 --> 00:25:37,367
300?
Don't you
want your hat?

573
00:25:37,433 --> 00:25:39,667
300.
I don't believe it.

574
00:25:39,733 --> 00:25:42,567
Will you pay it?
No, I won't!

575
00:25:42,633 --> 00:25:45,167
Good morning!

576
00:25:45,233 --> 00:25:47,300
Now who's the 300
merchant?

577
00:25:47,367 --> 00:25:48,933
There wasn't one.

578
00:25:49,067 --> 00:25:50,167
I was bluffing.

579
00:25:50,233 --> 00:25:51,233
I thought he'd fall
for it.

580
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,900
Well, that's torn it.

581
00:25:52,967 --> 00:25:55,267
Well, of all the...
Shh!

582
00:25:58,467 --> 00:26:00,900
Well, I think we may
be able to fix it.

583
00:26:00,967 --> 00:26:02,100
300?
300.

584
00:26:02,167 --> 00:26:04,167
And expenses.
And expenses.

585
00:26:04,233 --> 00:26:05,400
Good morning.
Good morning.

586
00:26:05,467 --> 00:26:07,767
Aye, aye, what
about a contract?

587
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:09,067
My word is my bond.

588
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,233
Well, what about
a bit on account?

589
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,433
Oh, all right.

590
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:16,367
There you are...
There's a £10 note.

591
00:26:16,433 --> 00:26:19,667
(Overlapping chatter)

592
00:26:19,733 --> 00:26:21,767
Has Mr. Bimeter gone?

593
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:23,933
My darling,
we're a success.

594
00:26:24,067 --> 00:26:27,233
We go to the London
Palindrome at 300 a week,

595
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,533
And you can go and buy any
personal article

596
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,200
With rings on your fingers
and bells on your toes.

597
00:26:34,267 --> 00:26:35,533
(Laughs)

598
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,633
(Man)
Mr. Max is a flop.

599
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,100
You're bound
to admit it.

600
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:40,267
Why, he's keeping people
out of the theater.

601
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:41,367
All this week,

602
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,267
He hasn't told the
audience a single thing.

603
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:45,133
What Mr. Coben wants
is prophecy.

604
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,900
(Man)
Mr. Max is doing his best.

605
00:26:46,967 --> 00:26:49,133
Well, Mr. Coben says
his best is bad.

606
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,067
What Mr. Coben wants
is prophecy.

607
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,833
Mr. Max can't turn 'em out
like sausages.

608
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,233
Well, Mr. Coben says
he's got to.

609
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,067
He's a clairvoyant,
not a pork butcher.

610
00:26:56,067 --> 00:26:57,900
Well, anyhow, Mr. Coben
wants results.

611
00:26:57,967 --> 00:27:00,333
Prophecies by Saturday,
or you're through.

612
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,433
Is that what
Mr. Coben said?

613
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,967
His very words.

614
00:27:03,067 --> 00:27:04,633
What Mr. Coben
wants is...

615
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,100
Prophecies.
Prophecies.

616
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:09,233
I'll prophesy a murder
in a minute.

617
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,867
Good morning.

618
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:15,600
(Door slams)

619
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,400
Darling, I don't think we
shall be at the Palindrome

620
00:27:22,467 --> 00:27:23,633
After this week.

621
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,200
Well...
Now, don't say
"I told you so."

622
00:27:26,267 --> 00:27:27,733
I know when to
keep quiet.

623
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,567
Well, I supposed we've
got till Saturday.

624
00:27:29,633 --> 00:27:31,300
Something
may come to me.

625
00:27:31,367 --> 00:27:33,767
If only my mind weren't
this awful blank.

626
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:35,233
You know, the more
I try to see things,

627
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,700
The emptier it gets.

628
00:27:36,767 --> 00:27:38,500
Then, all those people
out front every night,

629
00:27:38,567 --> 00:27:41,467
Wanting me to tell them
who's gonna win the boat race

630
00:27:41,533 --> 00:27:42,867
Or how many kittens
the cat's going to have.

631
00:27:42,933 --> 00:27:44,367
I know how you feel.

632
00:27:44,433 --> 00:27:46,200
I think you ought to
give it up.

633
00:27:46,267 --> 00:27:47,667
Yes, I do.

634
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:48,867
I've been watching you.

635
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:51,267
This constant effort,
it's making you ill.

636
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:54,067
Oh, I'm all right.

637
00:27:54,067 --> 00:27:56,767
Sweet, can't we go back
to the old act?

638
00:27:56,833 --> 00:27:59,200
For £10 a week and
lodgings for the night?

639
00:27:59,267 --> 00:28:00,533
We were happy then.

640
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,833
Aren't you happy now?

641
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,133
I've been happier.

642
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,600
Well, don't you like
this sort of life?

643
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:10,567
I like it if you do.

644
00:28:10,633 --> 00:28:13,667
Aye, sweet,
what's the matter?

645
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:17,267
Well, I... I haven't seen very
much of you lately, have I?

646
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:19,400
Well, isn't that
a pleasant change?

647
00:28:19,467 --> 00:28:20,833
I suppose it ought to be,

648
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,067
But you've become
a habit.

649
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,500
Bad habit, darling.

650
00:28:24,567 --> 00:28:26,600
Well, good women always
marry the wrong men.

651
00:28:26,667 --> 00:28:29,067
(Laughter)

652
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,233
You'd pass in a crowd.

653
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,833
Do you know, Max,

654
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:37,400
You don't even need me
in the act anymore.

655
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:39,633
Rene!

656
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,200
What's worrying you?

657
00:28:41,267 --> 00:28:45,867
(Phone ringing)

658
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:48,233
Hello?

659
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:53,733
Miss Shaw to see me?

660
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,333
All right, show her up.

661
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,833
Christine Shaw?

662
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,300
Mm, nice girl, that.

663
00:28:58,367 --> 00:29:00,067
Lovely head.

664
00:29:00,067 --> 00:29:01,233
(Knocks on door)
Oh, thank you.

665
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,900
Come in!

666
00:29:02,967 --> 00:29:04,133
Good morning,
darling.

667
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,533
Hello, Topsy.
Good morning.

668
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,267
Morning, Simon.
Morning.

669
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:09,167
Hello, Simple,
how do you feel?

670
00:29:09,233 --> 00:29:11,633
Like yesterday's beard.

671
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,100
You help him
with a go?

672
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:15,067
I think the entire
hotel did.

673
00:29:15,067 --> 00:29:18,867
He says what Mr. Coben
wants is prophecies.

674
00:29:18,933 --> 00:29:20,367
Well, that's not
unreasonable.

675
00:29:20,433 --> 00:29:23,500
Max, my dear, I'm very
worried about you.

676
00:29:23,567 --> 00:29:25,100
This clairvoyant business

677
00:29:25,167 --> 00:29:26,100
Nearly killed
your granddad.

678
00:29:26,167 --> 00:29:27,867
I know, Topsy.

679
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:30,300
I adore you, but you are
an old pessimist.

680
00:29:30,367 --> 00:29:32,567
After all,
Coben's only human.

681
00:29:32,633 --> 00:29:35,500
One or two prophecies a week
would keep him quiet.

682
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:37,900
Simon, I cannot switch
it on to order.

683
00:29:37,967 --> 00:29:40,300
I know,
but don't you think

684
00:29:40,367 --> 00:29:42,400
You could help
yourself out a bit?

685
00:29:42,467 --> 00:29:43,833
Well, what will you have?

686
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,900
Performing elephants?

687
00:29:44,967 --> 00:29:45,900
A bearded lady?

688
00:29:45,967 --> 00:29:48,467
No, you know
what I mean.

689
00:29:48,533 --> 00:29:50,567
Use your imagination.

690
00:29:50,633 --> 00:29:52,633
You mean, think.

691
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,900
(Knocks on door)
Come in.

692
00:29:53,967 --> 00:29:54,933
Miss Shaw
is here, sir.

693
00:29:55,067 --> 00:29:56,167
All right,
I'm coming.

694
00:29:56,233 --> 00:29:58,667
Where's my coat?
Here it is.

695
00:29:58,733 --> 00:30:00,467
Thank you, sweet.

696
00:30:00,533 --> 00:30:02,633
Miss Shaw?
Yes, Christine Shaw.

697
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,933
She's an early bird.

698
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,233
Street's
not aired yet.

699
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,233
Wait a minute, Max.

700
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,033
Here you are.

701
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,200
I like you to look your
best for your public.

702
00:30:17,667 --> 00:30:19,733
(Max)
Hello, how nice
to see you.

703
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,367
(Door closes)

704
00:30:24,567 --> 00:30:26,800
What's the matter?

705
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:28,900
Do I look different
or something?

706
00:30:28,967 --> 00:30:30,533
No, you're
just the same.

707
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,867
Well, how are you,
anyway?

708
00:30:31,933 --> 00:30:32,967
Terrible.

709
00:30:33,033 --> 00:30:34,033
Too early
to be anything else.

710
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,000
Well, you look
a little worried.

711
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:37,600
What's the matter?

712
00:30:37,667 --> 00:30:40,800
You don't miss much,
do you?

713
00:30:40,867 --> 00:30:42,400
Sit down
and I'll tell you.

714
00:30:42,467 --> 00:30:43,767
(Simon)
I wonder what she
wants to see him for?

715
00:30:43,833 --> 00:30:45,067
(Mother)
I don't know.

716
00:30:45,133 --> 00:30:46,933
Something about the
newspaper, I suppose.

717
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,200
Perhaps you're right.

718
00:30:48,267 --> 00:30:49,933
Might be another boost.

719
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,767
You know Coben?
The villain
of the piece.

720
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:55,500
He and father dined
together last night.

721
00:30:55,567 --> 00:30:57,500
Oh, he was horrible
about you.

722
00:30:57,567 --> 00:31:00,633
Did he use the word
"charlatan"?

723
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,433
Do you think I'm that?

724
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,433
Do you think
I'd be here if I did?

725
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,933
Well, he may have
been right.

726
00:31:07,067 --> 00:31:08,200
Do us a bit of good,
that would.

727
00:31:08,267 --> 00:31:09,667
I do hope
it's nothing serious.

728
00:31:09,733 --> 00:31:11,067
So do I.

729
00:31:11,067 --> 00:31:13,167
I've had enough shots
for one day.

730
00:31:13,233 --> 00:31:16,567
What we need
is some advertising.

731
00:31:16,633 --> 00:31:17,933
But your gift's
the real one.

732
00:31:18,067 --> 00:31:21,700
So real
I'm no good to Coben.

733
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:24,567
Good morning,
Miss Shaw.

734
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:25,833
Good morning.

735
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,533
Oh, Max, darling, you
forgot your handkerchief.

736
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,600
Thank you.

737
00:31:29,667 --> 00:31:33,267
How are you?
Very well, thank you.

738
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:34,800
Just in by hand,
sir.

739
00:31:34,867 --> 00:31:37,467
Marked very urgent.
Thank you.

740
00:31:38,533 --> 00:31:40,667
What is it, Max?
It's from Coben.

741
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:43,467
I know what that is.

742
00:31:43,533 --> 00:31:45,600
What Bimeter said?
Yes.

743
00:31:45,667 --> 00:31:47,567
From Saturday?
From now.

744
00:31:47,633 --> 00:31:49,400
Oh, dear.
There you are.

745
00:31:49,467 --> 00:31:50,800
Is there any answer, sir?

746
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:53,167
What? Uh, no.

747
00:31:53,233 --> 00:31:56,100
I wish you'd tell me the
winner of the derby, sir.

748
00:31:56,167 --> 00:32:00,067
Ortalicus.

749
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,600
What did you tell
that page?

750
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:05,233
Page?
What do you mean?

751
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,067
He asked you for
the derby winner.

752
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,100
You told him something.

753
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:12,133
Aye! Page! Page!

754
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,933
Here, boy, boy,
come here, here.

755
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:18,067
Look, what did
Mr. Maximus say?

756
00:32:18,067 --> 00:32:20,567
What horse?
He said Ortalicus, sir.

757
00:32:20,633 --> 00:32:22,233
But there ain't
no such animal.

758
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,333
There is!
I remember the name!

759
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,233
Here, where's the paper?

760
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:30,300
Here it is... Jenny Lynn,
3 to 1, Denny, 5 to 1,

761
00:32:30,367 --> 00:32:32,533
Playful Charles, 6 to...
It's not here.

762
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,167
It is, it is, look!

763
00:32:34,233 --> 00:32:39,533
Ortalicus.
100 to 1, Ortalicus.

764
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,600
That's right,
that's right.

765
00:32:43,667 --> 00:32:46,767
Ortalicus will win
the derby.

766
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:47,933
Ortalicus?

767
00:32:48,067 --> 00:32:49,200
Ortalicus couldn't
win the derby

768
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:51,600
If he had ten legs and
they fed him on dynamite.

769
00:32:51,667 --> 00:32:54,900
Ortalicus... he's not
a horse, he's a joke!

770
00:32:54,967 --> 00:32:56,200
Joke or not, he'll win.

771
00:32:56,267 --> 00:32:58,267
If you'll pardon me,
this is my job.

772
00:32:58,333 --> 00:32:59,800
I've had 20 years
experience on the turf.

773
00:32:59,867 --> 00:33:01,433
It's not a matter of
experience, Mr. Brooks.

774
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,667
I know and you know
it's all superstition.

775
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:06,100
All we've got to decide
is whether we can afford

776
00:33:06,167 --> 00:33:08,067
To let the paper
carry the story or not.

777
00:33:08,067 --> 00:33:09,833
But sir, we'd be
a laughingstock.

778
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,400
Not when Ortalicus wins.

779
00:33:11,467 --> 00:33:13,933
Daddy, Maximus was right
about the train.

780
00:33:14,067 --> 00:33:15,100
Ortalicus can't win!

781
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:16,100
They're only
running him

782
00:33:16,167 --> 00:33:17,100
In the hope
he'll fall dead

783
00:33:17,167 --> 00:33:18,500
To save the expense
of shooting him.

784
00:33:18,567 --> 00:33:20,267
Can't we run it
in question form?

785
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:22,833
"Can seer foretell
derby winner?"

786
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,467
Then, whatever happens,
we're all right.

787
00:33:24,533 --> 00:33:25,467
I'm opposed to it!

788
00:33:25,533 --> 00:33:27,567
It's news,
and it's safe, sir.

789
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:29,967
We'd be backing
a loser.

790
00:33:30,067 --> 00:33:31,500
I'll take a chance.

791
00:33:31,567 --> 00:33:32,900
You win, my dear.

792
00:33:32,967 --> 00:33:34,167
All right,
get the paper out.

793
00:33:34,233 --> 00:33:36,400
Hello, everybody.

794
00:33:36,467 --> 00:33:38,400
It's a brilliant scene
down here at Epsom.

795
00:33:38,467 --> 00:33:40,067
The Downs are crowded,
as usual,

796
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,533
And the interest
in this year's derby

797
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,167
Is greater than ever because
of the sensational prophecy

798
00:33:44,233 --> 00:33:45,533
Made by the great Maximus.

799
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,567
Uh, I think this must be
a record attendance.

800
00:33:48,633 --> 00:33:50,067
Certainly,
the volume of traffic

801
00:33:50,133 --> 00:33:51,733
Is greater
than ever before.

802
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,267
No doubt this is partly
due to the fact

803
00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:54,700
That Mr. Maximus himself

804
00:33:54,767 --> 00:33:56,500
Is expected to be
present at the race.

805
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:58,933
By the way, I had great
difficulty

806
00:33:59,067 --> 00:34:00,833
In getting here myself,
the traffic was so bad,

807
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:04,200
So I hope he left his London
hotel in plenty of time.

808
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,500
This way, please.

809
00:34:12,567 --> 00:34:14,067
Excuse me, Mr. Maximus.

810
00:34:14,067 --> 00:34:15,900
May I introduce you
to Mr. Hearn?

811
00:34:15,967 --> 00:34:17,367
How do you do,
Mr. Hearn?

812
00:34:17,433 --> 00:34:18,667
This car, Mr. Maximus.
This car?

813
00:34:18,733 --> 00:34:19,800
And then
we could discuss

814
00:34:19,867 --> 00:34:20,967
Your broadcast on
the way to the course.

815
00:34:21,067 --> 00:34:22,200
This way, madam,
please.

816
00:34:22,267 --> 00:34:24,267
Do you mind going down
without me?
No.

817
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:26,200
Mr. Maximus,
if you please!

818
00:34:26,267 --> 00:34:28,200
All right,
get in, Simon.

819
00:34:28,267 --> 00:34:29,733
Oh, thanks very much.

820
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,567
Aren't you excited?
How do I look?

821
00:34:31,633 --> 00:34:32,900
You look like the Queen
of Sheba, darling.

822
00:34:32,967 --> 00:34:35,600
(Laughter)

823
00:34:35,667 --> 00:34:37,067
(Car door shuts)

824
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,667
Who is that woman?

825
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,233
Christine Shaw.
Oh.

826
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:52,233
(Overlapping chatter)

827
00:34:54,633 --> 00:34:56,767
People are still pouring
into the stands,

828
00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:59,567
And there's a steady stream
of cars making its way...

829
00:34:59,633 --> 00:35:01,067
(Whispers)

830
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:02,200
Oh, I've just heard

831
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,167
That Mr. Maximus
has managed to get here.

832
00:35:04,233 --> 00:35:05,733
I must say,
I think he's lucky,

833
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,767
Because with this traffic
congestion on the road,

834
00:35:07,833 --> 00:35:10,067
I'm afraid there are bound
to be thousands of people

835
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,167
Who'll never
get to the course

836
00:35:11,233 --> 00:35:12,900
In time for
this year's derby.

837
00:35:12,967 --> 00:35:15,233
(Overlapping chatter)

838
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,867
Come on,
get a move on.

839
00:35:17,933 --> 00:35:20,933
We didn't come to see
a motor show.

840
00:35:21,067 --> 00:35:23,133
Turn it on a bit louder,
will you?
Yes, sir.

841
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,700
(Commentator)
Everything seems
pretty well set

842
00:35:24,767 --> 00:35:26,067
For another great derby.

843
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:29,500
Perhaps we shall be in
time for next year's race.

844
00:35:29,567 --> 00:35:31,133
(Overlapping chatter)

845
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,533
The race has started.

846
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,367
A really perfect collection
of three-year-olds.

847
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:37,067
Here comes Jenny Lynn,
yesterday's favorite.

848
00:35:37,133 --> 00:35:38,333
She looks
in fine condition.

849
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,067
And Hesperus.
There's Tiger Man.

850
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,967
I like the look of him.

851
00:35:42,067 --> 00:35:43,433
Hello, and here comes
Ortalicus,

852
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,533
The horse tipped to win by
Maximus the clairvoyant.

853
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,733
It seems incredible
the one man

854
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,967
Should have such influence.

855
00:35:48,067 --> 00:35:49,700
In a moment,
I'll speak to him.

856
00:35:49,767 --> 00:35:51,700
Jenny Lynn's the obvious
pick for today.

857
00:35:51,767 --> 00:35:53,267
I'm informed that
nothing can touch her,

858
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:55,167
Though Tiger Man has suddenly
shown real promise recently.

859
00:35:55,233 --> 00:35:56,667
Yes, yes, I learned
my little piece

860
00:35:56,733 --> 00:35:57,700
On the way down.

861
00:35:57,767 --> 00:35:58,967
I say, I can't
figure out

862
00:35:59,067 --> 00:36:00,233
What's happened
to my wife.

863
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,100
The last time I saw this
horse run was at Newbury.

864
00:36:02,167 --> 00:36:04,800
He finished strongly
on the mile and a quarter.

865
00:36:04,867 --> 00:36:06,167
As for Ortalicus,

866
00:36:06,233 --> 00:36:07,900
Despite Mr. Maximus'
assurances,

867
00:36:07,967 --> 00:36:09,800
I'm afraid I can't see him
finishing the course.

868
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:11,067
Still, as they say,

869
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,300
The derby's always
a gamble.

870
00:36:13,367 --> 00:36:16,800
(Overlapping chatter)

871
00:36:16,867 --> 00:36:18,133
They're going over
to the start now.

872
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,233
I think
we've just got time.

873
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,167
Here's Mr. Maximus.

874
00:36:21,233 --> 00:36:22,767
Max is going to speak.
Good old Max.

875
00:36:22,833 --> 00:36:23,800
Bless his heart.

876
00:36:23,867 --> 00:36:26,833
Uh, hello, everybody.

877
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:29,300
Uh, I... I can't
say much

878
00:36:29,367 --> 00:36:31,067
Because they're almost
ready to start.

879
00:36:31,133 --> 00:36:36,133
Uh, as regards Ortalicus,
well, it just came to me,

880
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,800
And, uh, well,
that's that.

881
00:36:38,867 --> 00:36:41,400
Events may prove
I'm wrong,

882
00:36:41,467 --> 00:36:43,867
But I think I'm right,
and, uh, well, that's all.

883
00:36:43,933 --> 00:36:46,933
Uh, good-bye.
Thank you, Mr. Maximus.

884
00:36:47,067 --> 00:36:49,733
Now, they're lining up
at the starting gate.

885
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,700
They're under
starter's orders.

886
00:36:51,767 --> 00:36:53,767
They're... they're
moving up.

887
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:54,800
They're moving up.

888
00:36:54,867 --> 00:36:57,100
Any moment now.

889
00:36:57,167 --> 00:36:58,167
They're off!

890
00:36:58,233 --> 00:37:00,567
Oh, it's started.

891
00:37:00,633 --> 00:37:02,167
Can't see who's winning
for the moment.

892
00:37:02,233 --> 00:37:03,633
They're all bunched up.

893
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,767
I... I can see Jenny Lynn,
Playful Charles,

894
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:09,600
Tiger Man, and Hesperus
in front.

895
00:37:09,667 --> 00:37:11,600
Ortalicus seems
to be boxed in.

896
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:13,867
He'll never make it unless
he gets away from the rails.

897
00:37:13,933 --> 00:37:15,067
They're coming up
to the course bushes,

898
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,700
And now
I can see them better.

899
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:18,200
It's Jenny Lynn
to the lead.

900
00:37:18,267 --> 00:37:19,367
She's setting
a tremendous pace.

901
00:37:19,433 --> 00:37:20,533
She'll never keep it up.

902
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,333
Playful Charles
is a length behind.

903
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,833
Tiger Man's well placed
and going strongly.

904
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,967
Hesperus is there.

905
00:37:26,067 --> 00:37:27,867
It's a terrific race!

906
00:37:27,933 --> 00:37:29,167
They're coming down to
the captain's wall now.

907
00:37:29,233 --> 00:37:31,300
Jenny Lynn still
leading by a length.

908
00:37:31,367 --> 00:37:32,500
Tiger Man's coming up.

909
00:37:32,567 --> 00:37:33,867
He's passed
Playful Charles.

910
00:37:33,933 --> 00:37:35,333
They're on the corner now.

911
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,433
Jenny Lynn's
still leading!

912
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,867
What a magnificent filly!

913
00:37:37,933 --> 00:37:39,833
It's uphill now, and
Tiger Man's closing the gap.

914
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,100
Tiger Man's now second.

915
00:37:41,167 --> 00:37:43,167
There's Hesperus,
right on the rails.

916
00:37:43,233 --> 00:37:44,700
Oh, now look
at Ortalicus!

917
00:37:44,767 --> 00:37:47,433
Ortalicus is coming
away on the outside!

918
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,700
It looks like
he'll make it yet!

919
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,267
No, he can't do it.

920
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:52,833
Tiger Man in place!

921
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,333
He's still at his heels!

922
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,900
On you go, Tiger Man!

923
00:37:55,967 --> 00:37:57,067
Tiger Man will win it!

924
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,867
Tiger Man, Tiger Man!

925
00:38:00,067 --> 00:38:02,267
Tiger Man wins!

926
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:07,867
Max was wrong.

927
00:38:07,933 --> 00:38:09,867
Here are the first
three past the post.

928
00:38:09,933 --> 00:38:13,833
Tiger Man, Ortalicus,
Jenny Lynn.

929
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,267
That puts us among
the also-ran.

930
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:17,533
But wait a minute.

931
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,600
There's an objection!

932
00:38:20,667 --> 00:38:23,267
Yes, the red flag's
going up!

933
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:28,433
(Crowd shouting)

934
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,867
And there goes
the green flag!

935
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:31,500
Objection sustained!

936
00:38:31,567 --> 00:38:32,633
Ortalicus!

937
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,800
Ortalicus wins
the derby!

938
00:38:34,867 --> 00:38:37,067
Ortalicus!
Max was right!

939
00:38:37,133 --> 00:38:42,467
He was right!
(Laughs)

940
00:38:42,533 --> 00:38:44,600
Thanks.
Oh, what a day.

941
00:38:44,667 --> 00:38:46,300
I thought we'd never
get home at all.

942
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:48,500
Is Mr. Maximus back yet?
Yes, madam.

943
00:38:48,567 --> 00:38:49,700
He returned
about 6:30.

944
00:38:49,767 --> 00:38:51,800
6:30? Oh, he'll be
waiting for us.

945
00:38:51,867 --> 00:38:54,367
I've got a first
I wouldn't sell for 1,000.

946
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:55,600
Taxi, please.

947
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:58,700
(Overlapping chatter)

948
00:39:02,067 --> 00:39:04,533
Oh, hello.

949
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,500
Good evening.

950
00:39:09,567 --> 00:39:11,700
Did you enjoy
the derby?

951
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:15,300
Oh, yes,
every word of it.

952
00:39:15,367 --> 00:39:17,633
Can I offer you anything?
Why, thank you.

953
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:21,867
Mr. Maximus
gave me a cocktail.

954
00:39:21,933 --> 00:39:24,833
He's just changing.

955
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:28,300
He really
ought to hurry.
Oh.

956
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:31,933
Well, I'll tell him.

957
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,267
Oh, hello, darling.

958
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:37,267
Thank heavens
you've come.

959
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,300
Help me with this collar,
will you?

960
00:39:39,367 --> 00:39:41,633
Oh, come on, sweet.
Going out, dear?

961
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,800
Yes, I'm off
to the derby banquet.

962
00:39:42,867 --> 00:39:44,400
With Christine Shaw?
Good Lord, no.

963
00:39:44,467 --> 00:39:45,433
I'm going with
her father.

964
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,433
It's a stag party.

965
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,700
I sense things have been
moving today.

966
00:39:47,767 --> 00:39:49,100
Yes, I guess some things.

967
00:39:49,167 --> 00:39:50,900
Southwood made me
the most marvelous offer.

968
00:39:50,967 --> 00:39:52,167
He wants me to
be newspaper prophet

969
00:39:52,233 --> 00:39:53,200
On TheDaily Sun.

970
00:39:53,267 --> 00:39:54,467
I say, did you
see the race?

971
00:39:54,533 --> 00:39:55,633
Where were you?
In the car.

972
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,400
He's offering
the most wonderful money.

973
00:39:57,467 --> 00:39:59,733
Have you accepted?
Oh, my darling!

974
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,667
What do you think?
There!

975
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:03,033
I'm starting
tomorrow, you know,

976
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,267
Looking into the future
and all that.

977
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:05,967
I like old Southwood.
Yes.

978
00:40:06,033 --> 00:40:07,467
You seem to like
his daughter too.

979
00:40:07,533 --> 00:40:09,000
Well, she's been rather
a brick, you know,

980
00:40:09,067 --> 00:40:10,967
And she's waiting now to
take me across in her car.

981
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,300
That's sweet of her.

982
00:40:12,367 --> 00:40:14,000
I say, darling,
what's the matter with you?

983
00:40:14,067 --> 00:40:16,567
Oh, nothing.
Oh, now,
come on, sunshine.

984
00:40:16,633 --> 00:40:18,067
What... what is
worrying you?

985
00:40:18,133 --> 00:40:20,300
Well, I thought
we might have been

986
00:40:20,367 --> 00:40:21,300
Together this evening.

987
00:40:21,367 --> 00:40:22,567
Yes, I... I know,
but you see,

988
00:40:22,633 --> 00:40:24,133
I've... I've got to go
to the banquet.

989
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,433
After all, it was arranged
by...
By Christine's father.

990
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,767
Yes, darling,
I'd take you if I could,

991
00:40:27,833 --> 00:40:29,200
But it's...
It's a stag party.

992
00:40:29,267 --> 00:40:30,400
And after all, now,

993
00:40:30,467 --> 00:40:32,700
You must realize it from
a business point of view.

994
00:40:32,767 --> 00:40:34,467
Here's your jacket.
Thank you, darling.

995
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:35,467
Now, don't be hurt.

996
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:36,567
After all,
now just think...

997
00:40:36,633 --> 00:40:38,533
Think what it's
leading to... our future.

998
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,167
I'm wondering what
it's going to be like.

999
00:40:40,233 --> 00:40:41,767
(Christine)
Max, it's time
we started.

1000
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:44,867
Coming!
"We"?

1001
00:40:44,933 --> 00:40:48,467
Darling, you're being
rather silly and petulant.

1002
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,200
Here's your coat.

1003
00:40:52,267 --> 00:40:54,367
Thank you, darling.
(Laughs)

1004
00:40:54,433 --> 00:40:55,600
I say, you're not upset

1005
00:40:55,667 --> 00:40:56,867
Because she's taking me
across, are you?

1006
00:40:56,933 --> 00:40:57,867
Should I be?

1007
00:40:57,933 --> 00:41:00,867
Oh, no, now, now,
darling.

1008
00:41:00,933 --> 00:41:03,067
Darling, now let's
meet afterwards

1009
00:41:03,133 --> 00:41:05,300
And have food together,
just the two of us.

1010
00:41:05,367 --> 00:41:06,500
Do you really think
you can eat

1011
00:41:06,567 --> 00:41:07,967
Two meals
in one evening?

1012
00:41:08,067 --> 00:41:10,233
Darling, you're being
rather childish!
Am I?

1013
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:14,067
Yes!
It's only because I
love you rather a lot.

1014
00:41:14,133 --> 00:41:16,767
(Christine)
Max!

1015
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:19,567
Well, good-bye, sweet.
Oh!

1016
00:41:19,633 --> 00:41:22,067
Oh, here's your hat.
Oh, uh, thanks.

1017
00:41:22,133 --> 00:41:23,533
Bye-bye.

1018
00:41:31,967 --> 00:41:33,067
(Overlapping chatter)

1019
00:41:33,133 --> 00:41:34,700
(Gavel banging)

1020
00:41:34,767 --> 00:41:37,067
Your grace, my lords,
and gentlemen,

1021
00:41:37,067 --> 00:41:40,833
I pray silence for your
chairman, the Lord Southwood.

1022
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:44,533
(Applause)

1023
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,533
Your grace, my lords,
gentlemen, to the King!

1024
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,833
The toast is to
His Majesty, the King.

1025
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,067
The King!
The King!
The King!

1026
00:41:51,067 --> 00:41:56,700
(Overlapping chatter)

1027
00:41:56,767 --> 00:41:58,467
(Gavel banging)

1028
00:41:58,533 --> 00:42:02,733
Your grace, my lords,
and gentlemen, you may smoke.

1029
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,100
(Overlapping chatter)

1030
00:42:04,167 --> 00:42:06,567
No, thank you,
I don't drink port.

1031
00:42:06,633 --> 00:42:10,667
(Overlapping chatter)

1032
00:42:10,733 --> 00:42:12,133
(Gavel banging)

1033
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,067
Your grace, my lords,
and gentlemen,

1034
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,933
I pray silence
for your chairman.

1035
00:42:18,067 --> 00:42:21,700
(Applause)

1036
00:42:21,767 --> 00:42:23,600
Your grace, my lords,
and gentlemen,

1037
00:42:23,667 --> 00:42:25,833
I hope you'll agree
with me

1038
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,767
That we've had
a very pleasant day,

1039
00:42:27,833 --> 00:42:29,067
Particularly me.

1040
00:42:29,133 --> 00:42:30,067
(Laughter)

1041
00:42:30,133 --> 00:42:31,933
Well, really...
It's all right.

1042
00:42:32,067 --> 00:42:33,733
I've only come
to fetch Father.

1043
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,100
Isn't he speaking now?

1044
00:42:36,167 --> 00:42:37,367
Yes.

1045
00:42:37,433 --> 00:42:39,333
I expect they'll be
at least an hour.

1046
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,067
I don't mind waiting.

1047
00:42:42,067 --> 00:42:43,933
(Men laughing)

1048
00:42:44,067 --> 00:42:46,067
If the committee knew there
was a lady in the club,

1049
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,167
They would think it was
the end of the world.

1050
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:50,267
Shh!
(Gasping)

1051
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:51,267
He has done me
the great honor

1052
00:42:51,333 --> 00:42:53,200
To accept an offer
I have made.

1053
00:42:53,267 --> 00:42:55,067
From tonight onwards,
gentlemen,

1054
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:58,767
He joins my newspaper
as seer.

1055
00:42:58,833 --> 00:43:01,800
In fact, I think we may say
in very truth, gentlemen,

1056
00:43:01,867 --> 00:43:03,667
He is the "profit"
of The Sun.

1057
00:43:03,733 --> 00:43:07,100
(Laughter)

1058
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:08,900
You're not eating
anything, darling.

1059
00:43:08,967 --> 00:43:11,633
I can't.
Stop.

1060
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:12,633
There.

1061
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:13,767
Have a drop
of this, dear,

1062
00:43:13,833 --> 00:43:14,767
To keep
your strength up.

1063
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:16,467
Mm.
No, thank you.

1064
00:43:16,533 --> 00:43:19,233
I know what you're
worrying about.

1065
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:22,300
I suppose it's dreadfully
foolish of me.

1066
00:43:22,367 --> 00:43:24,700
All she did was drive him
to the banquet.

1067
00:43:24,767 --> 00:43:26,067
That's all?

1068
00:43:26,133 --> 00:43:28,800
I was awfully mean to him
when he left.

1069
00:43:28,867 --> 00:43:30,300
He asked me
to meet him for supper,

1070
00:43:30,367 --> 00:43:33,200
And I never even said yes
or where or anything.

1071
00:43:33,267 --> 00:43:37,700
Well, why not ring
him up and fix it?

1072
00:43:37,767 --> 00:43:38,933
I should, shouldn't I?

1073
00:43:39,067 --> 00:43:40,200
It'll set your mind
at rest.

1074
00:43:40,267 --> 00:43:41,567
Absolutely.

1075
00:43:41,633 --> 00:43:43,500
He'll be feeling as blue
about it as you are.

1076
00:43:43,567 --> 00:43:44,667
Go on, do it now.

1077
00:43:44,733 --> 00:43:46,533
No time
like the present.

1078
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,467
All right.

1079
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,533
(Gavel banging)

1080
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,133
My lord chairman,
your grace,

1081
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,633
My lords,
and gentlemen,

1082
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:00,567
Pray silence
for Mr. Maximus.

1083
00:44:00,633 --> 00:44:05,300
(Applause)

1084
00:44:05,367 --> 00:44:06,533
Bravo.

1085
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,967
(Applause)

1086
00:44:10,067 --> 00:44:13,067
My lord chairman,
your grace,

1087
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:18,600
My lords, and, uh...
Uh, gentlemen,

1088
00:44:18,667 --> 00:44:21,267
First of all,
I would like to express

1089
00:44:21,333 --> 00:44:23,833
My indebtedness
to Lord Southwood

1090
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,367
And to all those
who have helped me.

1091
00:44:26,433 --> 00:44:31,067
Looking into the future,
I see trouble...

1092
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,600
Terrible trouble
for myself.

1093
00:44:33,667 --> 00:44:36,600
I'm sorry you
all look so relieved.

1094
00:44:36,667 --> 00:44:38,367
(Laughter)

1095
00:44:38,433 --> 00:44:40,933
If I dare to foretell
the winner of another race,

1096
00:44:41,067 --> 00:44:43,667
I shall most certainly be
assassinated by the bookmakers.

1097
00:44:43,733 --> 00:44:44,933
(Laughter)

1098
00:44:45,067 --> 00:44:47,533
If my prophecy is wrong,
then, uh,

1099
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,733
I shall have the public
themselves on my heels.

1100
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,133
(Phone buzzing)

1101
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,433
Who is it?

1102
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,533
Oh, Mrs. Maximus.

1103
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:59,467
Mrs. Maximus?
I'll speak to her.

1104
00:44:59,533 --> 00:45:02,100
Hello, this is
Christine Shaw.

1105
00:45:02,167 --> 00:45:03,467
Oh, it's
so exciting here.

1106
00:45:03,533 --> 00:45:05,767
Your husband's absolutely
the line of the evening

1107
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:08,433
And such
a brilliant speaker.

1108
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,200
Hello? Hello?

1109
00:45:14,267 --> 00:45:16,900
I've been cut off.

1110
00:45:16,967 --> 00:45:19,233
(Max)
It will mean
a greater profit.

1111
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,267
What's the matter?

1112
00:45:20,333 --> 00:45:21,333
Didn't you get Max?

1113
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,800
Christine Shawn.
That's impossible.

1114
00:45:23,867 --> 00:45:26,100
(Simon)
Yes, it's a stag party!

1115
00:45:26,167 --> 00:45:28,967
That's what I thought.

1116
00:45:31,567 --> 00:45:33,067
Rene.

1117
00:45:34,167 --> 00:45:35,400
Here's a pretty
kettle of fish.

1118
00:45:35,467 --> 00:45:36,967
What's she driving at?
You heard!

1119
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,300
You haven't got
coal for ears.

1120
00:45:38,367 --> 00:45:40,567
Anything I can do?
(Door slams)

1121
00:45:40,633 --> 00:45:43,833
What are you doing?
I'm going.

1122
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:45,833
What do you mean,
going?

1123
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:48,767
I'm leaving.
Oh, but why,
my dear, why?

1124
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:51,633
Isn't it perfectly
obvious?

1125
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,567
But you don't realize
what you're doing!

1126
00:45:53,633 --> 00:45:54,767
I can't let you go!

1127
00:45:54,833 --> 00:45:56,300
No, no, Mother, don't.

1128
00:45:56,367 --> 00:45:58,767
Where will you go?
What will you do?

1129
00:45:58,833 --> 00:46:00,367
Mother, please!
Please, Mother!
Rene!

1130
00:46:00,433 --> 00:46:03,967
I've told you,
I'm going.

1131
00:46:17,533 --> 00:46:20,200
Hello?
What are you doing?

1132
00:46:20,267 --> 00:46:22,100
Riding a bicycle.

1133
00:46:22,167 --> 00:46:23,767
Hello?

1134
00:46:23,833 --> 00:46:25,633
Finding Max,
you fool.

1135
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,400
Hello?

1136
00:46:27,467 --> 00:46:30,233
Hello?

1137
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,067
Give me a line,
please.

1138
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:35,067
(Buzzing)

1139
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:38,300
Hello?

1140
00:46:38,367 --> 00:46:40,100
Oh, I see.

1141
00:46:40,167 --> 00:46:46,233
Uh, just wait a moment.

1142
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:48,167
(Max)
We live in a frightening...

1143
00:46:48,233 --> 00:46:50,433
In many ways,
a very cruel world,

1144
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:53,100
And if I can alleviate by
even the smallest fraction

1145
00:46:53,167 --> 00:46:55,300
The burden of my fellow men,

1146
00:46:55,367 --> 00:46:58,200
Then I shall feel
that my life

1147
00:46:58,267 --> 00:47:03,467
And this gift with which
it is so curiously bound,

1148
00:47:03,533 --> 00:47:06,100
Has not been
entirely wasted.

1149
00:47:06,167 --> 00:47:08,567
(Applause)

1150
00:47:08,633 --> 00:47:16,500
(Overlapping chatter)

1151
00:47:27,667 --> 00:47:29,333
Why, hello, Christine.

1152
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,733
I didn't know they allowed
ladies in here.

1153
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,233
They don't.
Excuse me, will you?

1154
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:34,267
Thank you.

1155
00:47:34,333 --> 00:47:35,367
Hello?

1156
00:47:35,433 --> 00:47:36,900
Oh, hello, Mother.

1157
00:47:40,067 --> 00:47:42,067
Going away?

1158
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:45,400
Why is she going away?

1159
00:47:45,467 --> 00:47:47,400
Oh, no, no!

1160
00:47:47,467 --> 00:47:50,067
No, she's making
a mistake.

1161
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:52,500
You must talk to her.

1162
00:47:52,567 --> 00:47:53,967
No, no, no, no, no, no,

1163
00:47:54,067 --> 00:47:55,100
I... I can't come
at the moment,

1164
00:47:55,167 --> 00:47:56,933
But you must... you
must talk to her.

1165
00:47:57,067 --> 00:47:59,167
I'll get back
as soon as I can.

1166
00:47:59,233 --> 00:48:01,667
Yes, yes, hurry,
stop her!

1167
00:48:01,733 --> 00:48:03,667
St...

1168
00:48:05,533 --> 00:48:08,700
**

1169
00:48:08,767 --> 00:48:10,533
Max, what's the matter?

1170
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,400
That's queer.

1171
00:48:12,467 --> 00:48:15,133
**

1172
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,400
Hello?

1173
00:48:16,467 --> 00:48:18,200
Hello?

1174
00:48:18,267 --> 00:48:24,600
**

1175
00:48:24,667 --> 00:48:28,800
Cor, she... she rang off.

1176
00:48:28,867 --> 00:48:32,267
What was it?

1177
00:48:32,333 --> 00:48:34,700
I thought I saw...

1178
00:48:34,767 --> 00:48:36,700
Saw what?

1179
00:48:36,767 --> 00:48:38,067
My mother.

1180
00:48:38,133 --> 00:48:39,367
Max!

1181
00:48:39,433 --> 00:48:42,067
Christine!

1182
00:48:42,067 --> 00:48:46,133
**

1183
00:48:54,333 --> 00:48:58,800
Oh, no, it... it
couldn't have been.

1184
00:48:58,867 --> 00:49:00,800
It couldn't.

1185
00:49:00,867 --> 00:49:02,733
(Chattering and laughter)

1186
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,300
I must go back to
this banquet business.

1187
00:49:17,433 --> 00:49:19,367
Rene!

1188
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:24,233
Rene!

1189
00:49:26,133 --> 00:49:28,067
(Doorknob rattling)

1190
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:29,533
Open the door!

1191
00:49:36,233 --> 00:49:38,933
Don't be a little fool,
my dear.

1192
00:49:39,067 --> 00:49:42,600
Max said... Rene!

1193
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,367
Rene!

1194
00:49:48,433 --> 00:49:51,367
(Dramatic music)

1195
00:49:51,433 --> 00:49:59,367
**

1196
00:50:07,333 --> 00:50:09,267
(Mother screaming)

1197
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:17,700
What's the matter,
madam?

1198
00:50:17,767 --> 00:50:21,700
Uh, silly of me.

1199
00:50:21,767 --> 00:50:23,167
I fell downstairs.

1200
00:50:23,233 --> 00:50:24,567
Shall we fetch
a doctor?

1201
00:50:24,633 --> 00:50:25,867
No, no.

1202
00:50:25,933 --> 00:50:27,100
What happened?

1203
00:50:27,167 --> 00:50:28,100
Are you hurt?

1204
00:50:28,167 --> 00:50:29,367
I'm all right.

1205
00:50:29,433 --> 00:50:34,467
I... I just fell.

1206
00:50:34,533 --> 00:50:37,200
Where do you
think you're going?

1207
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:41,867
I'm coming back
with you.

1208
00:50:41,933 --> 00:50:44,467
That's right, darling.

1209
00:50:44,533 --> 00:50:52,233
Rene, I want to talk
to you about Max.

1210
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:55,300
Oh.

1211
00:50:55,367 --> 00:50:57,433
Oh... oh, darling.

1212
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,433
Hello?

1213
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,167
Hello, get me
Mr. Maximus, please,

1214
00:51:01,233 --> 00:51:02,767
If you know
where he is.

1215
00:51:02,833 --> 00:51:10,767
Rene, Rene, I must say
something to you, quickly.

1216
00:51:10,833 --> 00:51:12,100
No, no, not now.

1217
00:51:12,167 --> 00:51:14,233
I must, I must.

1218
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:17,067
It's about Max.

1219
00:51:17,067 --> 00:51:19,300
That gift is bad.

1220
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:20,333
It's no good.

1221
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,733
He must give it up.

1222
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:27,700
Yes, yes, of course.

1223
00:51:27,767 --> 00:51:30,833
Yes.

1224
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:34,067
It's Christine Shaw!

1225
00:51:34,067 --> 00:51:35,967
She's what
I said before.

1226
00:51:36,067 --> 00:51:39,233
She... she's the power.

1227
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,500
He must give it up.

1228
00:51:41,567 --> 00:51:44,433
He must give her up.

1229
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,967
Tell him, tell him.

1230
00:51:47,067 --> 00:51:48,433
I'll tell him.

1231
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:52,267
It's bringing unhappiness
to you both, darling.

1232
00:51:52,333 --> 00:51:56,833
Yes.

1233
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:59,467
They say one sees
very clearly

1234
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:02,533
In the face of...

1235
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:13,600
Oh! Oh, Topsy.

1236
00:52:13,667 --> 00:52:16,067
Topsy, oh.

1237
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:22,933
**

1238
00:52:23,067 --> 00:52:26,333
Oh, Max, you think
you're so infallible.

1239
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,300
You couldn't even see
your mother's death.

1240
00:52:29,367 --> 00:52:31,933
I did see it.

1241
00:52:32,067 --> 00:52:34,267
Or almost did.

1242
00:52:34,333 --> 00:52:38,867
Just after
she telephoned me.

1243
00:52:38,933 --> 00:52:42,333
But I put it
away from me.

1244
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,900
Christine was beside me.

1245
00:52:43,967 --> 00:52:47,100
Christine.

1246
00:52:47,167 --> 00:52:49,967
What your mother said
was true.

1247
00:52:50,067 --> 00:52:51,700
It's Christine's presence

1248
00:52:51,767 --> 00:52:55,367
That gives you
the power to see.

1249
00:52:55,433 --> 00:52:56,900
Why, you have
no gift at all

1250
00:52:56,967 --> 00:52:59,133
When she's not with you.

1251
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,067
I feel she's
very close tonight.

1252
00:53:02,133 --> 00:53:03,800
Max.

1253
00:53:03,867 --> 00:53:07,600
But it's as if there was
a bond between us,

1254
00:53:07,667 --> 00:53:12,567
A queer sort of sympathy.

1255
00:53:12,633 --> 00:53:16,467
It's stronger than I am.

1256
00:53:16,533 --> 00:53:19,933
Is it stronger than
your love for me?

1257
00:53:20,067 --> 00:53:22,067
Oh, please God,
I hope not.

1258
00:53:22,067 --> 00:53:23,667
Oh, Max.

1259
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:26,067
This thing is becoming
a mania with you.

1260
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:27,867
You've got to break
this bond,

1261
00:53:27,933 --> 00:53:30,067
Not for my sake but for
the sake of your sanity.

1262
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:31,267
I can't break it.

1263
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:32,667
It's going on.
I know it.

1264
00:53:32,733 --> 00:53:34,267
Weakness isn't
going to help.

1265
00:53:34,333 --> 00:53:36,700
Oh, Max, I'm fighting
a battle for your mind,

1266
00:53:36,767 --> 00:53:38,167
And I've got to win it!

1267
00:53:38,233 --> 00:53:40,733
We've got to go back
to the old life.

1268
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,067
Rene, don't you realize
what's happening to me?

1269
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:47,067
I can't go back.

1270
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:48,633
If you'll only use
your strength of will.

1271
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:50,500
What strength of will?

1272
00:53:50,567 --> 00:53:56,500
Against... Against...
What?

1273
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:57,900
**

1274
00:53:57,967 --> 00:53:58,967
I love you

1275
00:53:59,067 --> 00:54:01,867
More than anything
else in the world,

1276
00:54:01,933 --> 00:54:04,067
But if you
go on with this,

1277
00:54:04,067 --> 00:54:06,633
Then I will leave you.

1278
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:10,867
But it may be
a gift from God.

1279
00:54:10,933 --> 00:54:12,300
Or the devil.

1280
00:54:12,367 --> 00:54:20,233
(Bell tolling)

1281
00:54:25,833 --> 00:54:27,067
It's getting late.

1282
00:54:27,133 --> 00:54:28,667
You two ought to be
going back.

1283
00:54:28,733 --> 00:54:30,100
Yes.

1284
00:54:30,167 --> 00:54:31,500
Come on.

1285
00:54:31,567 --> 00:54:33,267
Do you mind if
I stay here a bit?

1286
00:54:33,333 --> 00:54:35,767
I'd like to do
some thinking.

1287
00:54:35,833 --> 00:54:38,267
So long as you think
along my line.

1288
00:54:38,333 --> 00:54:39,800
Don't worry.

1289
00:54:39,867 --> 00:54:41,700
Don't be too long.

1290
00:54:41,767 --> 00:54:44,300
I won't.

1291
00:54:44,367 --> 00:54:46,967
Aye, taxi!

1292
00:55:01,467 --> 00:55:05,733
Max, I meant what
I said, you know.

1293
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,800
You always do.

1294
00:55:07,867 --> 00:55:11,467
You will give it up?

1295
00:55:11,533 --> 00:55:13,067
I never argue
with a lady.

1296
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:15,633
(Laughs)

1297
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:17,933
Don't catch cold,
dear.

1298
00:55:18,067 --> 00:55:20,933
I won't.

1299
00:55:36,767 --> 00:55:44,700
**

1300
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:58,067
(Dramatic music)

1301
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:06,100
**

1302
00:56:07,333 --> 00:56:09,267
Sorry.

1303
00:56:09,333 --> 00:56:11,533
Did I hurt your arm?

1304
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:12,900
That's all right.

1305
00:56:12,967 --> 00:56:19,967
**

1306
00:56:20,067 --> 00:56:21,767
Have these.

1307
00:56:21,833 --> 00:56:23,567
**

1308
00:56:23,633 --> 00:56:24,700
Thanks.

1309
00:56:24,767 --> 00:56:28,100
**

1310
00:56:28,167 --> 00:56:29,767
Here.

1311
00:56:29,833 --> 00:56:32,200
**

1312
00:56:32,267 --> 00:56:33,633
That's the first
whole cigarette

1313
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:35,367
I've smoked for a week.

1314
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:38,633
**

1315
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:40,500
But I know your face.

1316
00:56:40,567 --> 00:56:42,567
I've seen it
in the papers.

1317
00:56:42,633 --> 00:56:44,867
Why, of course!

1318
00:56:44,933 --> 00:56:46,300
You're Maximus!

1319
00:56:46,367 --> 00:56:47,467
Yes.

1320
00:56:47,533 --> 00:56:49,467
I wish my future were
as happy as yours.

1321
00:56:49,533 --> 00:56:56,067
**

1322
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:57,767
Down on your luck?

1323
00:56:57,833 --> 00:57:00,633
Yes, that's a mild way
of putting it.

1324
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:01,967
How'd it happen?

1325
00:57:02,067 --> 00:57:06,133
Oh, a bad break,
I suppose.

1326
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,367
I had a chance

1327
00:57:07,433 --> 00:57:08,767
At what seemed a good
job offered me,

1328
00:57:08,833 --> 00:57:10,333
In the Humber shaft,

1329
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,067
Under the river,
you know,

1330
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:14,800
Only it meant
going up the hole,

1331
00:57:14,867 --> 00:57:16,700
And I had to choose

1332
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:18,700
Between my wife
and the job.

1333
00:57:18,767 --> 00:57:20,367
And you chose your wife?

1334
00:57:20,433 --> 00:57:22,700
I chose the job.

1335
00:57:22,767 --> 00:57:24,500
Nothing seems to have
gone right since.

1336
00:57:24,567 --> 00:57:27,800
Thanks for
telling me that.

1337
00:57:27,867 --> 00:57:29,067
What do you mean?

1338
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:33,167
I've been faced with much
the same problem myself.

1339
00:57:33,233 --> 00:57:35,800
The choice between
your wife or your job?

1340
00:57:35,867 --> 00:57:39,067
Yes, and thanks to you,
I've chosen my wife.

1341
00:57:39,067 --> 00:57:43,700
But you're wrong...
100% wrong!

1342
00:57:43,767 --> 00:57:47,067
You, Maximus, why
you've got no choice!

1343
00:57:47,133 --> 00:57:48,200
I don't follow you.

1344
00:57:48,267 --> 00:57:49,700
Then let me
tell you something!

1345
00:57:49,767 --> 00:57:53,167
You've got a far greater
gift than any of us!

1346
00:57:53,233 --> 00:57:54,733
You can build a new world

1347
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,733
By using the gift
as it should be used,

1348
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,400
By seeing all the terrible
things before they happen

1349
00:58:00,467 --> 00:58:02,233
And stopping them
whilst there's time!

1350
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:03,700
That's your job!

1351
00:58:03,767 --> 00:58:05,533
It's more than
your job.

1352
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,067
It's your duty!

1353
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:08,167
No, it's too late!

1354
00:58:08,233 --> 00:58:10,100
What you said first
decided me!

1355
00:58:10,167 --> 00:58:12,767
I'm putting this gift
out of my life forever!

1356
00:58:12,833 --> 00:58:15,067
(Dramatic music)

1357
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:19,700
(Machinery running)

1358
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:29,467
(Explosion)

1359
00:58:34,433 --> 00:58:35,600
Hello?

1360
00:58:35,667 --> 00:58:37,167
This is the Humber shaft.

1361
00:58:37,233 --> 00:58:39,233
(Loud banging)

1362
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:42,300
Daily Sun?
Is that Mr. Carther?

1363
00:58:42,367 --> 00:58:44,700
Yes, Carther speaking.

1364
00:58:44,767 --> 00:58:47,067
Mr. Carther? Dixon here.

1365
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:49,333
Yes, we're right in
the bowels of the earth.

1366
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,500
Yes, under the river.

1367
00:58:51,567 --> 00:58:53,067
Can you hear the drills?

1368
00:58:53,067 --> 00:58:54,900
(Machinery running)

1369
00:58:54,967 --> 00:58:56,367
It's deafening here.

1370
00:58:56,433 --> 00:58:57,767
What are you
talking about?

1371
00:58:57,833 --> 00:59:02,533
(Train rumbling)

1372
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:03,833
Well, that's a train
passing now.

1373
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:05,133
It's going
up to the surface.

1374
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:11,667
(Machinery running)

1375
00:59:11,733 --> 00:59:14,300
(Whistle blowing)

1376
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:38,233
(Overlapping chatter)

1377
00:59:41,067 --> 00:59:44,167
This will deafen him.

1378
00:59:44,233 --> 00:59:45,367
Hey, I heard a whistle.

1379
00:59:45,433 --> 00:59:46,833
They're going to
expose the charges.

1380
00:59:52,167 --> 00:59:53,100
Are we all right here?

1381
00:59:53,167 --> 00:59:54,700
Yeah, just keep well back.

1382
00:59:54,767 --> 00:59:56,267
(Worker)
Ready?

1383
00:59:56,333 --> 00:59:58,333
(Worker)
Clear!

1384
01:00:00,233 --> 01:00:01,333
Now!

1385
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:06,233
(Explosions)

1386
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:08,400
Now tell me you didn't
hear that one, Carther.

1387
01:00:08,467 --> 01:00:09,833
(Laughs)

1388
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,767
Now, look here, Carther,
what about this column?

1389
01:00:13,833 --> 01:00:15,167
Yes, I've got the stuff.

1390
01:00:15,233 --> 01:00:16,400
You can run it
in the first edition.

1391
01:00:16,467 --> 01:00:17,767
I'm not sure.

1392
01:00:17,833 --> 01:00:19,767
This derby prophecy is going
to take up a lot of space.

1393
01:00:19,833 --> 01:00:21,100
I'll find out
and ring you back.

1394
01:00:21,167 --> 01:00:24,567
Okay.
Good-bye.

1395
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:27,733
Hanging up.

1396
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,333
(Bells ringing)

1397
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:30,800
(Knocks)

1398
01:00:30,867 --> 01:00:32,000
(Max)
I tell you, I'm definite.

1399
01:00:32,067 --> 01:00:33,200
I'm not going on with it.
Yes, but listen.

1400
01:00:33,267 --> 01:00:34,867
If you don't mind,
I'd rather not discuss it.

1401
01:00:34,933 --> 01:00:36,900
I'm grateful to deserve
the offer you've made me,

1402
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:38,800
But I'm definitely
not accepting.

1403
01:00:38,867 --> 01:00:40,200
But Max.

1404
01:00:40,267 --> 01:00:42,267
Now, Christine, don't you
try to persuade me.

1405
01:00:42,333 --> 01:00:44,767
(Southwood)
Why the sudden change
in your point of view?

1406
01:00:44,833 --> 01:00:46,333
I have my reasons.

1407
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,200
Well, of course,
if you feel like that...

1408
01:00:48,267 --> 01:00:49,300
What is it, Carther?

1409
01:00:49,367 --> 01:00:50,633
Oh, excuse me, sir,
it's Dixon.

1410
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:52,167
We've kept that
column open for him,

1411
01:00:52,233 --> 01:00:53,467
And I've got him hanging
on the phone now,

1412
01:00:53,533 --> 01:00:55,067
From the Humber shaft.

1413
01:00:55,133 --> 01:00:56,167
Oh, yes, do you
want me to run

1414
01:00:56,233 --> 01:00:57,333
That Humber shaft
story, sir?

1415
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,700
(Southwood)
Humber shaft.
What do you think?

1416
01:00:59,767 --> 01:01:03,233
The Humber shaft...
That's queer.

1417
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:05,500
A man was talking to me
about the Humber shaft.

1418
01:01:05,567 --> 01:01:06,900
Max!

1419
01:01:06,967 --> 01:01:10,633
The Humber shaft... there's
going to be a disaster!

1420
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:12,567
The waters sweeping in will
carry the men away!

1421
01:01:12,633 --> 01:01:14,167
(Others arguing)
I tell you, I'm right!

1422
01:01:14,233 --> 01:01:15,533
You've got to warn them!
What do you mean?

1423
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,067
Did I say
I wouldn't go on?

1424
01:01:17,133 --> 01:01:18,300
I must go on!

1425
01:01:18,367 --> 01:01:19,767
Here's your
first prophecy!

1426
01:01:19,833 --> 01:01:22,067
The Humber shaft
will be destroyed!

1427
01:01:22,133 --> 01:01:23,700
Splash it across
your front page!

1428
01:01:23,767 --> 01:01:25,667
Give it all the space you can!
You're crazy!

1429
01:01:25,733 --> 01:01:27,533
Save the poor devils
while there's time!

1430
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,533
What do you think I am?

1431
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:29,600
I'd run myself in

1432
01:01:29,667 --> 01:01:31,267
For the biggest libel
action of the century!

1433
01:01:31,333 --> 01:01:33,233
I was right about
the train, wasn't I?

1434
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:34,933
But there are millions
of pounds involved!

1435
01:01:35,067 --> 01:01:36,733
And there are hundreds
of lives involved!

1436
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:39,067
He's right, Father,
you've got to run it!

1437
01:01:39,133 --> 01:01:40,933
I will not!
Then I'll go elsewhere!

1438
01:01:41,067 --> 01:01:42,367
No other paper
will run it either.

1439
01:01:42,433 --> 01:01:43,667
You mean, no one
will warn the men?

1440
01:01:43,733 --> 01:01:45,267
Go down Fleet Street
and see.

1441
01:01:45,333 --> 01:01:46,567
I'm not going down
Fleet Street!

1442
01:01:46,633 --> 01:01:48,733
I'm going out
to the Humber, now!

1443
01:01:52,433 --> 01:01:53,367
Max.
Yeah?

1444
01:01:53,433 --> 01:01:54,433
My car's outside.

1445
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:56,600
Can I take you?
Yes, come on.

1446
01:01:56,667 --> 01:01:58,067
Yes, he's here.

1447
01:01:58,100 --> 01:01:59,333
Arrived about
an hour ago.

1448
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,400
Crazy isn't the word
for it.

1449
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:01,633
He's been telling
the manager

1450
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:03,933
That the tunnel's gonna
blow up or something.

1451
01:02:04,067 --> 01:02:05,233
Yeah, the news spread
through the workers

1452
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:07,633
And the men came
streaming up like flies.

1453
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:09,800
Yes, he's talking
to them now.

1454
01:02:09,867 --> 01:02:11,867
I tell you, if you
go down today,

1455
01:02:11,933 --> 01:02:13,700
Half of you will never
come up alive!

1456
01:02:13,767 --> 01:02:15,133
You've got to believe me!

1457
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,133
Do you think I came all
this way just to fool you?

1458
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,833
There's going to be
a disaster!

1459
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,533
Nothing can prevent it!

1460
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:21,567
Don't you take
any notice of him!

1461
01:02:21,633 --> 01:02:22,767
The man's crazy!

1462
01:02:22,833 --> 01:02:24,367
You want to be caught
like so many rats?

1463
01:02:24,433 --> 01:02:26,633
The Daily Sun wouldn't
publish my warnings!

1464
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:28,633
Your own managers
refuse to listen to me!

1465
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:31,067
They said I was talking
superstitious nonsense,

1466
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:32,533
But it isn't nonsense!

1467
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,467
Was I right about
The Manchester Express?

1468
01:02:34,533 --> 01:02:36,267
(Overlapping shouting)

1469
01:02:36,333 --> 01:02:38,500
Was I wrong
about the derby?

1470
01:02:38,567 --> 01:02:39,967
Can any one of you
look me in the eyes

1471
01:02:40,067 --> 01:02:41,533
And tell me
I'm wrong now?

1472
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:42,767
You're mad!

1473
01:02:42,833 --> 01:02:45,233
Get back to your work,
all of you!

1474
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:46,500
I came up here
to warn you,

1475
01:02:46,567 --> 01:02:48,667
To save you from the terror
which I know is coming!

1476
01:02:48,733 --> 01:02:50,767
I implore you,
I beseech you,

1477
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:53,133
For the sake of your wives,
your mothers and your sons,

1478
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,300
Don't go
on the night shift!

1479
01:02:55,367 --> 01:02:57,067
(Overlapping shouting)

1480
01:02:57,067 --> 01:02:58,433
Enough, all of you!

1481
01:02:58,500 --> 01:02:59,633
Have you all gone mad?

1482
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:01,067
Where are you going?

1483
01:03:01,067 --> 01:03:02,767
Are you going to throw
yourselves out of work

1484
01:03:02,833 --> 01:03:05,100
For the sake of
a nasty trickster?

1485
01:03:05,167 --> 01:03:07,067
Hey, out of work!

1486
01:03:07,067 --> 01:03:08,467
That's what I said!

1487
01:03:08,533 --> 01:03:11,700
(Whistle blowing)

1488
01:03:11,767 --> 01:03:13,300
There's the signal
for the night shift.

1489
01:03:13,367 --> 01:03:14,967
The train is waiting
to take you down.

1490
01:03:15,067 --> 01:03:16,733
Get to your work,
all of you!

1491
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:19,500
The man who refuses
is through!

1492
01:03:19,567 --> 01:03:20,567
(Overlapping shouting)

1493
01:03:20,633 --> 01:03:22,800
Through, and you can
take it or leave it!

1494
01:03:22,867 --> 01:03:26,667
Well, are you going down?
They'll go down.

1495
01:03:26,733 --> 01:03:27,800
(Overlapping chatter)

1496
01:03:27,867 --> 01:03:29,800
Well, what are you
waiting for?

1497
01:03:29,867 --> 01:03:31,367
The shaft's
perfectly safe...

1498
01:03:31,433 --> 01:03:32,767
Safe as your own houses!

1499
01:03:32,833 --> 01:03:34,400
Get back to work,
every one of you!

1500
01:03:34,467 --> 01:03:37,067
The train is waiting
to take you down.

1501
01:03:37,067 --> 01:03:45,067
(Overlapping chatter)

1502
01:03:53,867 --> 01:03:55,967
Yes, they're
going down again.

1503
01:03:56,067 --> 01:03:59,367
Yeah, I'll ring
through later.

1504
01:03:59,433 --> 01:04:07,433
(Overlapping chatter)

1505
01:04:16,167 --> 01:04:17,900
Max.

1506
01:04:17,967 --> 01:04:22,533
Those poor devils.

1507
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,767
You're not to blame,
whatever happens.

1508
01:04:24,833 --> 01:04:27,300
Why couldn't I
convince them?

1509
01:04:27,367 --> 01:04:28,433
No, Rene was right.

1510
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:29,667
I shouldn't have
gone on with it.

1511
01:04:29,733 --> 01:04:31,067
She wasn't right.

1512
01:04:31,067 --> 01:04:33,067
You've got something that
belongs to the world.

1513
01:04:33,133 --> 01:04:34,200
You've got to go on.

1514
01:04:34,267 --> 01:04:35,300
You believe that?

1515
01:04:35,367 --> 01:04:37,200
I know it.

1516
01:04:37,267 --> 01:04:40,500
Perhaps it's
women's intuition,

1517
01:04:40,567 --> 01:04:43,500
Or perhaps it's just
because I love you.

1518
01:04:49,333 --> 01:04:52,767
Why do you look
like that?

1519
01:04:52,833 --> 01:04:55,300
Because you love me?

1520
01:04:55,367 --> 01:04:58,067
Is that wrong?

1521
01:04:59,867 --> 01:05:03,200
I don't know.

1522
01:05:03,267 --> 01:05:08,100
Max, I love you.

1523
01:05:08,167 --> 01:05:11,300
I'm sorry.

1524
01:05:11,367 --> 01:05:13,500
Oh, I'm sorry.

1525
01:05:19,267 --> 01:05:21,933
Well, are you
satisfied now?

1526
01:05:22,067 --> 01:05:25,500
No, it's on your own head,
MacGregor!

1527
01:05:54,233 --> 01:05:55,800
Well, they seem to be
getting on with it.

1528
01:05:55,867 --> 01:05:57,633
Come on, come on,
come on.

1529
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:00,067
Some of them
aren't so happy.

1530
01:06:00,067 --> 01:06:01,700
I'll be glad when
this shift's over.

1531
01:06:01,767 --> 01:06:03,133
Aw, snap out of it!

1532
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,367
You're safe enough.

1533
01:06:04,433 --> 01:06:06,100
Try that one.

1534
01:06:09,767 --> 01:06:10,700
You sure
you're all right?

1535
01:06:10,767 --> 01:06:11,867
I'm all right.

1536
01:06:13,633 --> 01:06:15,500
Are you ready?

1537
01:06:15,567 --> 01:06:18,500
No!
No, wait!

1538
01:06:18,567 --> 01:06:26,500
(Explosion)

1539
01:06:34,167 --> 01:06:42,100
(Workers screaming)

1540
01:06:42,167 --> 01:06:50,100
(Overlapping shouting)

1541
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:30,267
(News vendor)
Humber shaft arrest!

1542
01:07:30,333 --> 01:07:32,067
Humber shaft arrest!

1543
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:33,733
Humber shaft arrest!

1544
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:41,467
(Overlapping voices
of news vendors)

1545
01:07:41,533 --> 01:07:46,800
(Overlapping chatter)

1546
01:07:46,867 --> 01:07:48,067
It wouldn't have happened

1547
01:07:48,133 --> 01:07:49,433
If he hadn't put
the wind up them!

1548
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:50,833
Murderer...
That's what he is!

1549
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:53,067
He ought to be hanged!
Lynched!

1550
01:07:53,067 --> 01:07:54,500
Are you gonna stand here
and do nothing?

1551
01:07:54,567 --> 01:07:55,733
No!
No!
No!

1552
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,067
Well, you're going to
show Maximus

1553
01:07:57,067 --> 01:07:58,933
He can't murder our people
and get away with it!

1554
01:07:59,067 --> 01:08:06,500
(Overlapping shouting)

1555
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:24,800
Get back!

1556
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:26,067
Get back!

1557
01:08:26,067 --> 01:08:28,133
(Overlapping shouting)

1558
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:31,167
(Prosecutor)
This terrible tragedy
in the Humber shaft

1559
01:08:31,233 --> 01:08:33,133
Was brought about
by panic...

1560
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,733
Panic which is
directly traceable

1561
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:39,067
To the so-called prophecy
of the prisoner at the bar.

1562
01:08:39,067 --> 01:08:41,467
The very nature of
the prisoner's activities

1563
01:08:41,533 --> 01:08:42,700
Made it vital

1564
01:08:42,767 --> 01:08:45,233
That he should keep his name
before the public!

1565
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:49,467
He chose a very terrible means
of achieving that objective.

1566
01:08:49,533 --> 01:08:52,900
200 bodies
have been recovered.

1567
01:08:52,967 --> 01:08:57,700
110 are still lying
in that shaft, your honor.

1568
01:08:57,767 --> 01:09:01,133
The deaths of these men
must be laid at the door

1569
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:05,767
Of one man only...
The prisoner!

1570
01:09:07,867 --> 01:09:10,200
I call my first witness,
Miss Christine Shaw.

1571
01:09:10,267 --> 01:09:14,867
Miss Christine Shaw!
Miss Christine Shaw!

1572
01:09:18,433 --> 01:09:20,433
(Christine)
I swear by Almighty God

1573
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:21,667
That the evidence
which I give this court

1574
01:09:21,733 --> 01:09:22,833
To be the truth,
the whole truth,

1575
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:24,233
And nothing but the truth.

1576
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:26,200
(Prosecutor)
You are Miss
Christine Shaw?

1577
01:09:26,267 --> 01:09:27,367
Yes.

1578
01:09:27,433 --> 01:09:28,667
You are attending here
on subpoena?

1579
01:09:28,733 --> 01:09:29,700
Yes.

1580
01:09:29,767 --> 01:09:31,267
I understand
that you were present

1581
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:34,300
When the prisoner
foresaw the disaster.

1582
01:09:34,367 --> 01:09:37,533
I was with him in the cab
when a state came on him.

1583
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,633
Well, if you'd like to
call it that.

1584
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:41,733
The prisoner just lost
his post on The Daily Sun.

1585
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:43,400
He just resigned it.

1586
01:09:43,467 --> 01:09:45,433
Well, I suppose we might
put it that way.

1587
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:47,267
He had resigned it!
Quiet, quiet.

1588
01:09:47,333 --> 01:09:48,700
We really needn't
quarrel about a word.

1589
01:09:48,767 --> 01:09:50,067
At any rate,
at this juncture,

1590
01:09:50,067 --> 01:09:51,900
The prisoner was out
of employment.

1591
01:09:51,967 --> 01:09:52,900
Yes.

1592
01:09:52,967 --> 01:09:55,100
And so he promptly
made a prophecy

1593
01:09:55,167 --> 01:09:57,067
Which was bound to
attract public attention.

1594
01:09:57,067 --> 01:09:58,133
That's not why he made it.

1595
01:09:58,200 --> 01:09:59,767
You don't think it was?

1596
01:09:59,833 --> 01:10:02,233
You drove the prisoner
up to the Humber?

1597
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:03,400
Yes.

1598
01:10:03,467 --> 01:10:05,333
You were there when
he told the workers

1599
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:06,700
There would be
a disaster?

1600
01:10:06,767 --> 01:10:09,267
Yes.
The workers were alarmed?

1601
01:10:09,333 --> 01:10:12,300
I might almost say they
were in a state of panic?

1602
01:10:14,367 --> 01:10:15,767
What's that
got to do with it?

1603
01:10:15,833 --> 01:10:17,133
Were they alarmed?

1604
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:19,067
Of course they were
alarmed.

1605
01:10:19,133 --> 01:10:20,867
His prophecies come true.

1606
01:10:20,933 --> 01:10:22,367
Exactly.

1607
01:10:22,433 --> 01:10:25,367
Then, do you not think,
from what you saw,

1608
01:10:25,433 --> 01:10:27,300
That the workers' alarm
was calculated

1609
01:10:27,367 --> 01:10:28,800
To bring about
a state of tension

1610
01:10:28,867 --> 01:10:32,033
Hardly conducive
to safety?

1611
01:10:33,933 --> 01:10:35,200
I don't understand.

1612
01:10:35,267 --> 01:10:38,367
Come, come, Miss Shaw.

1613
01:10:38,433 --> 01:10:40,533
You're trying to force me
to speak against him!

1614
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:43,467
I am asking you
if you don't believe

1615
01:10:43,533 --> 01:10:45,967
That the accident was due to
the prisoner's prophecy.

1616
01:10:46,033 --> 01:10:47,167
I wasn't in the shaft.

1617
01:10:47,233 --> 01:10:48,200
How am I to know?

1618
01:10:48,267 --> 01:10:50,900
Answer the question,
Miss Shaw.

1619
01:10:50,967 --> 01:10:52,367
I can't answer it.

1620
01:10:52,433 --> 01:10:54,233
You're here
to give evidence.

1621
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:56,700
I didn't want to come!
Why not?

1622
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:58,300
Was it because you
thought your evidence

1623
01:10:58,367 --> 01:11:00,067
Would hurt
the prisoner's case?

1624
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:02,333
I didn't think about it
at all.

1625
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:03,867
Oh, well, perhaps
you'll be good enough

1626
01:11:03,933 --> 01:11:04,933
To think now.

1627
01:11:05,067 --> 01:11:06,100
You were present,
I understand,

1628
01:11:06,167 --> 01:11:07,300
When the accused

1629
01:11:07,367 --> 01:11:09,533
Prophesied The Manchester
Express disaster.

1630
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:10,533
Yes.

1631
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,933
Are you aware that
had the prisoner

1632
01:11:13,067 --> 01:11:14,100
Not stopped the train,

1633
01:11:14,167 --> 01:11:15,267
It would have
cleared the points

1634
01:11:15,333 --> 01:11:18,267
And the collision
would have been avoided?

1635
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:23,733
Miss Shaw?

1636
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:24,767
I didn't know that.

1637
01:11:24,833 --> 01:11:26,767
Well, I tell it
to you now as a fact.

1638
01:11:26,833 --> 01:11:28,067
Do you still believe

1639
01:11:28,067 --> 01:11:30,600
The prisoner is
a genuine clairvoyant?

1640
01:11:30,667 --> 01:11:32,500
He foretold
the derby winner.

1641
01:11:32,567 --> 01:11:34,667
He's not the first person

1642
01:11:34,733 --> 01:11:36,800
To bring off
a 100-to-1 chance.

1643
01:11:36,867 --> 01:11:39,267
How do you know this wasn't
merely a lucky coincidence?

1644
01:11:39,333 --> 01:11:40,800
Why do you ask me that?

1645
01:11:40,867 --> 01:11:42,833
How can any of us know
what is the truth?

1646
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:44,067
Then you agree with me.

1647
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:45,767
You are not sure that
the gift is genuine.

1648
01:11:45,833 --> 01:11:48,133
That's not what I said!
Thank you.

1649
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:51,833
But...
Thank you, Miss Shaw,
that is all.

1650
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:58,133
I have no questions
to ask this witness.

1651
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:01,867
Call Arthur Watts!
Arthur Watts!

1652
01:12:01,933 --> 01:12:03,933
Arthur Watts!

1653
01:12:07,933 --> 01:12:09,933
(Crying)

1654
01:12:11,833 --> 01:12:13,167
I let him down.

1655
01:12:13,233 --> 01:12:14,533
(Crying)

1656
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:17,300
I let him down.

1657
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:23,600
They told me you were
going to leave him.

1658
01:12:23,667 --> 01:12:26,133
I haven't left him.

1659
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:29,600
(Crying)

1660
01:12:29,667 --> 01:12:31,933
You love him,
don't you?

1661
01:12:32,067 --> 01:12:33,933
Yes.

1662
01:12:34,067 --> 01:12:37,600
I wanted to take him
away from you.

1663
01:12:37,667 --> 01:12:39,267
Do you still want to?

1664
01:12:39,333 --> 01:12:41,600
He doesn't care for me.

1665
01:12:41,667 --> 01:12:43,267
(Sniffles)

1666
01:12:43,333 --> 01:12:46,600
But you care for him,
and you can help him.

1667
01:12:46,667 --> 01:12:47,967
I hate to say this
to you,

1668
01:12:48,067 --> 01:12:49,767
But I've got to
make you understand.

1669
01:12:49,833 --> 01:12:53,700
You see, the gift only comes
when you're near him.

1670
01:12:53,767 --> 01:12:54,933
It's got to stop.

1671
01:12:55,067 --> 01:12:56,333
It's got to.

1672
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:57,900
You mustn't see him again.

1673
01:12:57,967 --> 01:12:59,900
(Prosecutor)
You are telling us
that it was panic

1674
01:13:00,067 --> 01:13:01,967
Caused the disaster?

1675
01:13:02,067 --> 01:13:04,633
Yes, panic.

1676
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:07,100
And that but for
this man's prophecy,

1677
01:13:07,167 --> 01:13:08,400
Your fellow workers

1678
01:13:08,467 --> 01:13:10,633
Would have been
alive today?

1679
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:14,700
As God is my judge,
I believe they would.

1680
01:13:17,167 --> 01:13:19,067
I do love him so.

1681
01:13:19,133 --> 01:13:20,767
Yes, we both love him,

1682
01:13:20,833 --> 01:13:22,933
But it's his happiness
I'm thinking of.

1683
01:13:23,067 --> 01:13:26,467
If this thing goes on,
I believe he'll go mad.

1684
01:13:26,533 --> 01:13:28,067
Oh, don't you understand?

1685
01:13:28,133 --> 01:13:32,267
(Crying)
It's up to you.

1686
01:13:32,333 --> 01:13:34,067
(Exhaling)

1687
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:36,933
I'll never
see him again.

1688
01:13:37,067 --> 01:13:38,667
Promise?

1689
01:13:38,733 --> 01:13:41,467
Never, after today.

1690
01:13:41,533 --> 01:13:43,467
And that,
members of the jury,

1691
01:13:43,533 --> 01:13:45,500
Concludes the case
for the prosecution.

1692
01:13:49,333 --> 01:13:53,067
Members of the jury,
my client's elusive fame...

1693
01:13:53,133 --> 01:13:54,733
Many times
throughout history,

1694
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,900
Men have stood much
as my client stands now,

1695
01:13:57,967 --> 01:14:00,200
Feared by mankind
for no greater sin

1696
01:14:00,267 --> 01:14:01,533
Than the possession
of a gift

1697
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:04,067
Which the world
has failed to understand.

1698
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:06,467
Knowing the strength
of my case,

1699
01:14:06,533 --> 01:14:09,533
I propose to call
two witnesses only...

1700
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:13,467
My client himself
and his wife Rene.

1701
01:14:13,533 --> 01:14:16,200
I call Mrs. Maximus.

1702
01:14:18,367 --> 01:14:21,367
Mrs. Maximus, please.

1703
01:14:26,533 --> 01:14:30,567
(Overlapping shouting)

1704
01:14:30,633 --> 01:14:33,067
Of course I believe
in my husband's power.

1705
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:34,633
I didn't want him
to use it,

1706
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:36,200
But he felt
if he did use it,

1707
01:14:36,267 --> 01:14:37,700
He could help people.

1708
01:14:37,767 --> 01:14:39,800
Did you believe
it was genuine?

1709
01:14:39,867 --> 01:14:41,333
It is genuine.

1710
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:42,633
I only wish it weren't.

1711
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:43,900
I see.

1712
01:14:43,967 --> 01:14:45,600
And has it always
been genuine?

1713
01:14:45,667 --> 01:14:47,467
Yes, always.

1714
01:14:47,533 --> 01:14:49,767
So that right back
in those old days,

1715
01:14:49,833 --> 01:14:51,667
When the great Maximus
and yourself were

1716
01:14:51,733 --> 01:14:53,767
A somewhat indifferent
music hall turn,

1717
01:14:53,833 --> 01:14:56,133
Earning a somewhat
indifferent salary,

1718
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,133
Even then you believed
that your husband

1719
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:00,700
Was a genuine clairvoyant?

1720
01:15:00,767 --> 01:15:02,533
Oh, no, not then.

1721
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:05,133
He was not genuine?

1722
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:06,233
Well, you see,
I mean...

1723
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:08,800
Was he or was he not?

1724
01:15:08,867 --> 01:15:10,700
That's not
a fair question.

1725
01:15:10,767 --> 01:15:12,100
It is a perfectly
fair question.

1726
01:15:12,167 --> 01:15:13,400
Answer me directly.

1727
01:15:13,467 --> 01:15:16,400
Was your husband
a charlatan or not?

1728
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:23,267
Our act was
a professional routine.

1729
01:15:23,333 --> 01:15:24,933
A fake routine?

1730
01:15:25,067 --> 01:15:26,200
Well, yes,
of course it was.

1731
01:15:26,267 --> 01:15:27,433
It had to be,
don't you see?

1732
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:28,767
You have admitted

1733
01:15:28,833 --> 01:15:30,267
That your husband was a
professional trickster.

1734
01:15:30,333 --> 01:15:31,567
Thank you.

1735
01:15:31,633 --> 01:15:33,533
Oh, no, but the...
The gift, that's different.

1736
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,600
The one was fake,
the other was not.

1737
01:15:35,667 --> 01:15:37,367
I don't wish to
detain you any further.

1738
01:15:37,433 --> 01:15:38,600
But I must explain!

1739
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:40,800
This way, if you please.

1740
01:15:44,533 --> 01:15:45,933
(Overlapping chatter)

1741
01:15:46,067 --> 01:15:47,633
(Judge)
Silence in court!

1742
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:50,267
Silence in court!

1743
01:15:52,067 --> 01:15:55,100
This way, miss, please.
Mr. Maximus, please.

1744
01:15:55,167 --> 01:15:56,533
Mr. Maximus.

1745
01:15:56,600 --> 01:16:04,200
(Overlapping shouting)

1746
01:16:04,267 --> 01:16:06,067
I swear by almighty God

1747
01:16:06,133 --> 01:16:07,833
That the evidence
which I give this court

1748
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:09,067
Should be the truth,
the whole truth,

1749
01:16:09,067 --> 01:16:11,767
And nothing but the truth.

1750
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:14,867
Mr. Maximus, I have
only a few questions.

1751
01:16:14,933 --> 01:16:17,267
Why did you foretell
the Humber shaft disaster?

1752
01:16:17,333 --> 01:16:18,600
Because I foresaw it.

1753
01:16:18,667 --> 01:16:21,267
You must tell
what you see?

1754
01:16:21,333 --> 01:16:23,367
I must tell what
I see.

1755
01:16:23,433 --> 01:16:25,600
You believe you could have
saved these men's lives?

1756
01:16:25,667 --> 01:16:27,300
I could have saved them.

1757
01:16:27,367 --> 01:16:29,833
You were not prompted by
any thought of gain?

1758
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:31,067
I was not.

1759
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:32,367
Tell the court.

1760
01:16:32,433 --> 01:16:35,200
Is this gift genuine
or is it not?

1761
01:16:35,267 --> 01:16:38,833
It is genuine,
God help me.

1762
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:41,600
Thank you,
that is all.

1763
01:16:41,667 --> 01:16:44,067
(Prosecutor)
I find your statement
most interesting,

1764
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:45,067
Mr. Maximus.

1765
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:46,233
So you really believe

1766
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:47,667
In this clairvoyant
business yourself?

1767
01:16:47,733 --> 01:16:49,667
Of course I believe in it.

1768
01:16:49,733 --> 01:16:51,267
Quite, it's a gift,
isn't it?

1769
01:16:51,333 --> 01:16:52,700
I think that's what
you call it.

1770
01:16:52,767 --> 01:16:54,600
You have the effrontery
to assert

1771
01:16:54,667 --> 01:16:56,067
That you can
foretell the future.

1772
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:58,200
You claim omnipotence.

1773
01:16:58,267 --> 01:16:59,633
You have a gift
from God Himself.

1774
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:01,067
I never said that.

1775
01:17:01,067 --> 01:17:02,300
Well, then perhaps it's
from the other source.

1776
01:17:02,367 --> 01:17:03,600
Is that it?

1777
01:17:03,667 --> 01:17:06,767
Perhaps you'll tell us
it's a gift from the devil.

1778
01:17:06,833 --> 01:17:10,067
(Overlapping chatter)

1779
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:14,067
Somebody else
once suggested that.

1780
01:17:14,133 --> 01:17:16,267
If this gift is genuine,

1781
01:17:16,333 --> 01:17:18,333
Why not
demonstrate it here?

1782
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:19,700
It's simple enough.

1783
01:17:19,767 --> 01:17:22,067
Give us a taste of
your quality, Maximus.

1784
01:17:22,067 --> 01:17:23,233
Prove that
you are genuine,

1785
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:25,067
And my case
falls to the ground.

1786
01:17:25,133 --> 01:17:26,967
Prophesy, Maximus.

1787
01:17:27,067 --> 01:17:28,200
Put on your act.

1788
01:17:28,267 --> 01:17:29,767
Demonstrate your art.

1789
01:17:29,833 --> 01:17:32,667
Tell the jury what
will be their verdict.

1790
01:17:32,733 --> 01:17:39,267
Prophesy, Maximus,
prophesy, prophesy.

1791
01:17:39,333 --> 01:17:41,467
But I can't...
I can't to order.

1792
01:17:41,533 --> 01:17:42,767
But you can for money.

1793
01:17:42,833 --> 01:17:44,767
But I... I can't see.

1794
01:17:44,833 --> 01:17:47,233
Of course you can't,
and I'll tell you why.

1795
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:50,367
Because you're a
charlatan and a faker!

1796
01:17:50,433 --> 01:17:51,867
If you're not,

1797
01:17:51,933 --> 01:17:58,100
Why did your wife
threaten to leave you?

1798
01:17:58,167 --> 01:18:02,100
Why did your wife threaten
to leave you?

1799
01:18:02,167 --> 01:18:10,100
**

1800
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:17,700
I see a man.

1801
01:18:17,767 --> 01:18:20,333
Ah, that's better!

1802
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:23,733
Now, members of the jury,
watch him perform.

1803
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:29,200
110 living men.

1804
01:18:29,267 --> 01:18:31,600
They're tapping
their way out

1805
01:18:31,667 --> 01:18:35,367
By the eastern shaft.

1806
01:18:35,433 --> 01:18:37,467
The eastern shaft.

1807
01:18:37,533 --> 01:18:41,067
They're weak,
they're famished,

1808
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:43,300
But they're alive!

1809
01:18:43,367 --> 01:18:45,633
They're tapping
their way out.

1810
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:48,467
They're at the surface!

1811
01:18:48,533 --> 01:18:51,733
Soon, news will come!

1812
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:55,300
News, soon!

1813
01:18:55,367 --> 01:19:01,767
(Overlapping chatter)

1814
01:19:01,833 --> 01:19:05,333
They're alive!
They're alive!

1815
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:07,200
(Overlapping chatter)

1816
01:19:07,267 --> 01:19:15,133
(Cheering)

1817
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:23,800
They're alive!
Alive? Oh!

1818
01:19:23,867 --> 01:19:25,533
What's all this?
It's true, I tell you!

1819
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:26,733
They got them all out!

1820
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:27,733
They're alive!

1821
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:30,667
(Overlapping shouting)

1822
01:19:30,733 --> 01:19:32,700
Silence in court!
(Whispering)

1823
01:19:32,767 --> 01:19:34,533
Silence in court!

1824
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:36,367
I am given to understand

1825
01:19:36,433 --> 01:19:38,467
That what you have just
told us is the truth.

1826
01:19:38,533 --> 01:19:42,067
These men are free
and alive.

1827
01:19:42,133 --> 01:19:44,467
In these circumstances,
I have no option

1828
01:19:44,533 --> 01:19:46,667
But to suggest to the
foreman of the jury that...

1829
01:19:46,733 --> 01:19:49,267
If, uh, you'll
excuse me, my lord,

1830
01:19:49,333 --> 01:19:51,533
We, the jury, are agreed.

1831
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:55,200
Our verdict is
not guilty.

1832
01:19:55,267 --> 01:20:01,933
(Overlapping chatter)

1833
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:09,933
(Overlapping shouting)

1834
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,767
Come on, step up!

1835
01:20:16,833 --> 01:20:18,933
Draw in closer
and be entertained

1836
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,100
By the greatest clairvoyant
and mind-reader

1837
01:20:21,167 --> 01:20:22,800
America has ever seen!

1838
01:20:22,867 --> 01:20:24,033
Why, he's only a taste

1839
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:25,633
Of what you're gonna
see inside, folks,

1840
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:29,600
And all for a dime, ten cents,
the tenth part of a dollar!

1841
01:20:29,667 --> 01:20:31,367
Come on,
put him to the test!

1842
01:20:31,433 --> 01:20:34,500
Call him anything you like,
but remember, it's $50

1843
01:20:34,567 --> 01:20:36,333
To the one that can say
how he does it!

1844
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:37,600
$50!

1845
01:20:37,667 --> 01:20:39,433
Come on, mister,
what's $50 to you

1846
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:40,433
If you can tell us
how he does it?

1847
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:41,900
It'd be a shame
to take the money.

1848
01:20:41,967 --> 01:20:44,467
Ah, you don't know what
you're missing, mister.
Okay.

1849
01:20:44,533 --> 01:20:45,567
(Laughter)

1850
01:20:45,633 --> 01:20:47,733
Come on, let's go
get a hot dog.

1851
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:48,800
(Female assistant)
Thanks very much!

1852
01:20:48,867 --> 01:20:49,800
What am I holding?

1853
01:20:49,867 --> 01:20:50,933
A fountain pen.

1854
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,867
Step up, ladies and
gentlemen, step up!

1855
01:20:52,933 --> 01:20:54,100
It's all free!

1856
01:20:54,167 --> 01:20:55,833
See for yourself
the greatest...

1857
01:20:55,900 --> 01:20:59,833
