1
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:30,195
<i>Hey, coach,</i>
<i>uh, it's Penelope.</i>

2
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:33,565
<i>Just calling to say, um</i>

3
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:36,468
<i>that I'm freaking out</i>
<i>a little bit.</i>

4
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,338
<i>I think, just basically,</i>
<i>I feel like</i>

5
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,741
<i>I've prepared for this,</i>
<i>obviously, my whole life.</i>

6
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:45,778
<i>And now that I am here, um,</i>

7
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,180
<i>I just really wanted to be,</i>

8
00:00:48,182 --> 00:00:51,683
<i>exactly what I hoped</i>
<i>I would be, you know?</i>

9
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:53,285
<i>'Cause, otherwise,</i>
<i>what are you doing</i>

10
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:56,755
<i>with your whole life</i>
<i>up until that point?</i>

11
00:00:56,757 --> 00:01:00,025
<i>I just really, really</i>
<i>wanted to be,</i>

12
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:04,596
<i>that thing that I,</i>
<i>that I wanted to be.</i>

13
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:08,500
<i>If not, then that's</i>
<i>the hard part about,</i>

14
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:10,803
<i>having a dream come true.</i>

15
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:17,676
<i>Sorry, you know what?</i>

16
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:21,914
<i>I'm squeezing too tight again.</i>

17
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:26,151
<i>But, I hope I really feel</i>
<i>like an Olympian,</i>

18
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:27,886
<i>when it's done.</i>

19
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:30,122
<i>I mean, I don't know</i>
<i>how much of that,</i>

20
00:01:30,124 --> 00:01:32,124
<i>is in my control or not.</i>

21
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:35,694
It seems like it's gonna be
really cool,

22
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,162
so, I probably shouldn't
freak out so much,

23
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:40,933
but, just being here alone
is sort of like,

24
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:43,335
you just have
a lot of time to think.

25
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:45,437
And, um, I guess just today,

26
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,073
is one of those
sensitive days, you know?

27
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:49,641
And, 'cause, yeah...

28
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:54,113
just call me, um...

29
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:58,250
...if you have time.

30
00:01:58,252 --> 00:02:00,619
Uh, and if not, that's okay.

31
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:03,722
Um, I will...

32
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:06,225
...like, talk to you later.

33
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:08,894
Okay, thanks for everything.

34
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:10,529
Bye.

35
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:16,034
Stupid.

36
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:19,164
Yes, um, I'm registering, uh..

37
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:22,134
Okay, I'm a dentist.

38
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:24,369
A volunteer.
Do you know where I register?

39
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,805
- No, I don't know. Yeah.
- You don't know? Okay.

40
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:28,207
Excuse me, do you know
where the medical center is?

41
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:31,577
- I'm a volunteer dentist.
- Ah!

42
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:36,515
- Go inside and..
- Yeah. Ask there?

43
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:40,152
Alright, I'll just keep
wandering.

44
00:03:40,154 --> 00:03:41,887
Thank you.

45
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:55,200
- Oh! Hi.
- Hey! Hey.

46
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:58,370
Um, I'm Maggie.
I live down the hall.

47
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:01,473
- Penelope. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

48
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:04,876
Um, so you're an athlete too?

49
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:06,144
Yup, I'm an athlete.

50
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:07,980
Cross-country skiing.
What about you?

51
00:04:07,982 --> 00:04:09,615
- Uh, Mogul skiing.
- Cool.

52
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:11,083
I was gonna grab some food.

53
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:12,718
- You wanted to join?
- Oh, cool.

54
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,089
Um, cool, but I'm gonna just

55
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:19,992
take a nap because my race
is in--

56
00:04:19,994 --> 00:04:21,426
It's right after the opening
ceremony.

57
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:24,396
So, I just gotta.. - Ok.
- You know, like, get the..

58
00:04:24,398 --> 00:04:26,898
- Yeah. I got you.
- Rest.

59
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,268
- I'll let you have your space.
- Okay, cool, thanks.

60
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,970
- Um, nice to meet you.
- Yeah, but after..

61
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:33,572
I'm gonna take you up
on that meal.

62
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:36,141
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Okay, Yeah.

63
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:37,876
Um....

64
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:11,476
Okay.

65
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,291
Hey, Kristi, um, ahem.

66
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:29,461
Good, uh, morning
or... goodnight.

67
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:32,731
I don't know what time of the
day it is where you are

68
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,700
but, um, I just wanted
to let you know

69
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:37,703
that I, um, have settled in

70
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:39,571
and set my office up,

71
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:43,675
and, um, I know that,

72
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,378
we are like on a break,

73
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,847
and not supposed to be talking--

74
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,782
I can't remember
what the rule was.

75
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:53,618
But, if I'm breaking the rule,
then I'm sorry.

76
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:58,190
Um, but, just, uh, the
CliffsNotes is..

77
00:05:58,192 --> 00:05:59,925
It's bananas.

78
00:05:59,927 --> 00:06:01,593
Anyway, uh,
yeah, give me a call,

79
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:05,364
if you're around and we will
catch up at some point. Bye.

80
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:14,439
So my name is Dr. E.

81
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:16,241
It's Ezra,
but you can call me Dr. E.

82
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:18,110
- How do you feel?
- Excited.

83
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:20,812
- Yeah? Are you nervous?
- Yes. A little bit.

84
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:22,981
- Is this your first Olympics?
- Yes.

85
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,416
You want to go
in circles like that, you know?

86
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:26,518
And you want to get
up into the gums.

87
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,521
But you don't want to go
too hard into the gums, right?

88
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:30,655
Some people don't like flossing.

89
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:33,892
My fiancee-- My ex... blah, blah,

90
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,761
whatever you want to call it,
Kristie.

91
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:37,095
She doesn't like flossing,
and I'm like,

92
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:39,030
"Can you just get in there
a little bit

93
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:40,699
every once in a while,
it's preventative."

94
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:42,300
But that is not your problem.

95
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:45,604
Your problem is making sure that
you take care of your gums.

96
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:49,908
And if any of the Estonians
need any dental care

97
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,343
tell 'em to come
to Dr. E.

98
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:53,945
<i>- Dr. E. Okay.</i>
- Okay. Alright.

99
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,523
Thank you.

100
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:16,301
Um, can I have some chicken,
please?

101
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:41,226
Are you a..
You're a oral surgeon?

102
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:44,329
- Yes, I'm oral surgeon. Okay.
- You're a dentist?

103
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:47,165
I'm just a dentist.
Is the money better?

104
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:48,767
- Yeah.
- The money's better.

105
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:51,803
Altogether we'll do a selfie.
We'll do a selfie. Ready?

106
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,939
Hey!

107
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:55,874
Thank you so much.

108
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:46,591
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the</i>
<i>athletes of the Pyeong Chang</i>

Hi, uh, is this seat taken?

115
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:53,325
No.

116
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,806
- You like bananas?
- Sorry.

117
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:10,241
You like bananas?

118
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:13,845
Yes.

119
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,614
Are you competing?

120
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:18,883
- What? Yes.
- Are you competing?

121
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:20,385
- Oh, awesome.
- I'm competing.

122
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:22,587
What's your, uh..
I'm sorry.

123
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:25,223
I'm a cross-country skier
and I'm competing today.

124
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:29,361
- Wow! How do you feel?
- I feel good.

125
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:32,597
Yeah? Is there..
Are you nervous? Is it like...

126
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:34,466
- I'm so sorry. I totally..
- It's okay.

127
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,735
Like it's.. It is totally fine.
I just,

128
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:38,370
I got to do what I'm gonna do.

129
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:40,405
- I like, I have to do this.
- I know, I know, I'm sorry.

130
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:43,174
Well, just my last thing
is that, I'm a dentist here.

131
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:45,276
So, like, I would be remiss

132
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:47,545
if I didn't give you some of
these little floss things.

133
00:10:47,547 --> 00:10:50,081
They're really good
for blood flow when you floss.

134
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,083
So just think about it,
consider it.

135
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:53,485
No pressure. I'm so sorry.

136
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:54,919
- What's your name?
- Penelope.

137
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:57,155
Penelope, I'm Ezra.

138
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,557
- You're gonna kick ass today.
- Thank you.

139
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:01,292
And I'll leave you alone

140
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,561
and I'm so sorry
for screwing up your stuff.

141
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:06,064
- It's okay.
- <i>Good luck.</i>

142
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:08,099
I believe in you
and I'm rooting for you.

143
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:09,934
- Okay. Break a leg.
- Bye. Bye.

144
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:11,503
You idiot.

145
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:57,575
<i>There was a race I think today.</i>

146
00:12:57,577 --> 00:13:00,278
Um, this girl, Penelope raced.

147
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,781
You don't know how -- how
she did, do you?

148
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:05,416
No, I don't. The weather's
pretty brutal out there.

149
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:07,786
Maybe, I don't know
if that maybe would have,

150
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:09,187
been a factor in her race.

151
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:11,790
But I haven't... haven't heard
much. <i>- Yeah.</i>

152
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:13,158
<i>Is it super cold</i>
<i>up on the mountain?</i>

153
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,959
Oh, it's cold and so windy.

154
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,643
There's a cross-country meet
in the women's,

155
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:33,978
do you know,
I don't know if you saw,

156
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,246
how a girl named Penelope did?

157
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:36,614
<i>No, I don't, I don't.</i>

158
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:38,283
Cause I've been in the office
all day.

159
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:40,051
I think she was racing today,
so I'm just --

160
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:42,387
- I don't know Penelope.
<i>- Alright, okay, man.</i>

161
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:41,546
<i>Hello? Hey, coach, hey.</i>

162
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:45,216
I'm, actually,
with all my new friends.

163
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,552
Yeah, we're in the locker room.

164
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:50,421
All the girls from my race
were all, like, hugging.

165
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:52,223
We've been, like,
hugging each other,

166
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:55,093
for a really long time
since the race.

167
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:59,230
All together. So cool.

168
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,699
<i>I kind of wished I'd placed</i>
<i>higher, to be honest.</i>

169
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:05,904
<i>But I know, like,</i>
<i>I did my best.</i>

170
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:08,106
<i>It just went by</i>
<i>really quickly, I guess.</i>

171
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:11,442
<i>So, I'm still taking it all in.</i>

172
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:17,782
<i>I just don't know if it feels</i>
<i>how I wanted it to feel.</i>

173
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,136
Come in.

174
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,472
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Hi.

175
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:15,974
<i>- How are ya?</i>
- Good.

176
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:19,143
- Whatcha reading?
- Just a GRE book.

177
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,079
What's it about?

178
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:25,183
Oh, it's really boring.

179
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:27,285
I went to a medal ceremony.

180
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:31,789
Um, just to watch
and it was, like..

181
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,593
I felt, like, kind of selfish.

182
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:36,961
Because, I was, like,
happy for them,

183
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:38,663
but, then I wasn't happy
for them.

184
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,933
I didn't feel like
I would ever be up there.

185
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:44,335
<i>Yeah, I definitely feel</i>
<i>that selfish feeling</i>

186
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:48,806
of being lost
and knowing that, like,

187
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:51,376
that could've been me
if I did something else.

188
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:54,479
If I could have changed
something.

189
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:59,017
I want right now
to know what's...

190
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:01,352
...next,

191
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,154
and I don't.

192
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:09,994
I know what you're feeling.
I don't have it together either.

193
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:15,199
I just, I'm making sure that I
don't ruin my own experience

194
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:19,570
by letting that one run,

195
00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:24,675
gonna dictate how I spend
the rest of my time.

196
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:26,911
<i>And, I guess,</i>
<i>I just wanna make sure,</i>

197
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:30,782
you know, like,
this isn't the end.

198
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:35,453
You too. You too.

199
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:38,156
Can we stay friends,
like, after this?

200
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:41,959
- Yes, please. I like that.
- Okay. Okay.

201
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:07,652
Oh! Ooh!

202
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:26,771
- Hi.
- Hi.

203
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:30,541
I'm Ezra, the dentist guy,
I met you. How..

204
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:32,743
- How are you?
- Good.

205
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:35,246
- Can I sit?
- Yeah.

206
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:37,648
I came outside and I saw you
sitting alone,

207
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:42,720
and, uh, I swear I'm not, like,
a creep, I just, uh...

208
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:44,355
I just don't know that many
people and I talked

209
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:47,925
to you already, and so I felt
like I could talk to you again.

210
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:51,662
I'm never outside.
It's so cold.

211
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:54,065
Do you wanna get, like,
a hot chocolate or something?

212
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,536
I'm glad, uh....

213
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,740
Thank you for getting, uh...

214
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:03,941
I'm sorry they
didn't have cocoa

215
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:05,977
they just had coffee, but,

216
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,945
- That's okay. I'm..
- It's warm.

217
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:11,082
It's warm and I'm not gonna
sleep anyway.

218
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:12,683
I...

219
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:15,920
...got you this.

220
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:19,023
- You got me a stuffed animal?
- I got you a stuffed animal.

221
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:24,695
I, uh--
You looked kinda bummed out.

222
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:28,299
<i>And, so, I thought that</i>
<i>would maybe, like,</i>

223
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:31,269
<i>make you feel</i>
<i>a little bit better.</i>

224
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,672
I...

225
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:38,009
...want to feel like
this person.

226
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,777
Yeah.

227
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:43,881
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

228
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:47,552
I get it, I think.
I mean, it's got goggles.

229
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:54,792
<i>- How old are you?</i>
- Thirty-seven.

230
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:56,594
- How old are you?
- Twenty-two.

231
00:19:56,596 --> 00:20:00,431
<i>Twenty-two, wow!</i>
<i>That's, like..</i>

232
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:02,867
- Old.
<i>- Young.</i>

233
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:11,442
I got here yesterday evening.

234
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:15,012
But everyone else got here a few
days before that, right?

235
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:17,481
Yeah, well,
they called me two days ago.

236
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:18,516
<i>Really?</i>

237
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:19,650
'Cause someone got injured,

238
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:21,953
and so I gotta replace them.

239
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:24,755
Did you always know you wanted
to go to the Olympics?

240
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:27,225
Yeah, it's like
every child's dream.

241
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,590
- Oh....
- Hey!

242
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:00,791
- Hi.
- Hi, how's it goin'?

243
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:02,560
- Good.
- Good.

244
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:04,462
- I'm Penelope.
- Seamus.

245
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:06,731
- Seamus. Nice to meet you.
- Yes. Pleasure, Penelope.

246
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:08,199
Part of the reasons
why I started snowboarding,

247
00:21:08,201 --> 00:21:11,302
was to catch air
and be in the sky,

248
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:13,404
though, like,
that sense of flying.

249
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:16,974
And if I can do that
every day for a job,

250
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:20,044
then I think I, you know,
sweat to have.

251
00:21:20,046 --> 00:21:22,146
Camaraderie at its finest.

252
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:24,148
<i>What's your-- What are you</i>
<i>guys, what's your sport?</i>

253
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:27,118
- We snowboard half-pipe.
- <i>Snowboard half-pipe.</i>

254
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,021
<i>And you guys all know each</i>
<i>other a long time?</i>

255
00:21:30,023 --> 00:21:31,856
- Yeah, we're homies.
- You guys are homies?

256
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:32,923
- Yeah.
- That's nice.

257
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:34,358
I got a group of friends

258
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,827
that I've been tight
with since college.

259
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:39,063
We all kind of live
in different cities now.

260
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:40,898
Just about everybody's married.

261
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,302
<i>One of my buddies is divorced.</i>
<i>He's got a kid.</i>

262
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:46,270
<i>Just don't wanna make that</i>
<i>mistake and then end up,</i>

263
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:48,039
<i>in a position</i>
<i>where you're, like,</i>

264
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:51,042
<i>did I marry the right person?</i>

265
00:21:51,044 --> 00:21:53,377
- Right.
- <i>Are you guys married?</i>

266
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:55,246
<i>Any of you guys together,</i>
<i>you guys..</i>

267
00:21:55,248 --> 00:21:57,048
- <i>No? Single?</i>
- Single.

268
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,784
<i>How is the single life</i>
<i>here at the games?</i>

269
00:21:59,786 --> 00:22:01,619
- It's good.
- Pretty good.

270
00:22:01,621 --> 00:22:04,388
Say brah. I'm joking.

271
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,557
Penelope, I'm Anthony.
Nice to meet you.

272
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,528
How it works in skeleton is,

273
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,396
you literally have to lay there.

274
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:14,065
Naturally, you have to steer.

275
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:15,966
And like a lot of people ask,
like, how do you steer?

276
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:17,702
And you know, like,
you know the song,

277
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:18,936
"Head, Shoulders,
Knees and Toes?"

278
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:20,571
- Yes.
- That's how we steer.

279
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:21,605
- Really?
- Yeah.

280
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:23,007
Straightaways, head steer,

281
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,442
is just tilting your head
this way.

282
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:26,010
Curves, shoulders.

283
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:28,112
Hard pressure curves is knees
and shoulders.

284
00:22:28,114 --> 00:22:30,848
And then emergency steers if you
need to do something immediate

285
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,450
with your sled, drop a toe.

286
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:35,786
That's so cool.
That's so weird.

287
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:38,289
So, but, you know,
you overthink it too much

288
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:40,124
you'll drive yourself
into a wall.

289
00:22:40,126 --> 00:22:41,926
<i>That's why I'm here,</i>
<i>just trying to</i>

290
00:22:41,928 --> 00:22:43,461
<i>forget about some things</i>
<i>so that I can go</i>

291
00:22:43,463 --> 00:22:45,329
<i>and enjoy it even though</i>
<i>it's the biggest</i>

292
00:22:45,331 --> 00:22:46,831
<i>race of my life.</i>

293
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:49,166
Nico. From New Zealand, huh?

294
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:52,136
So, I'm just gonna check your
lymph nodes.

295
00:22:52,138 --> 00:22:55,072
- Cool, sweet ass.
- What does that mean, sweet as?

296
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:57,608
It means, I don't know,
I guess, cool.

297
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,276
- How old are you?
- Sixteen.

298
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:03,681
Sixteen. Are you,
are you the youngest Olympian?

299
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:05,549
Mm-hmm.
Youngest male, I think.

300
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:09,320
- Have you broken anything?
- I've broken my pelvis.

301
00:23:09,322 --> 00:23:12,990
- It's, it's heavy.
- I know. Yeah.

302
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:16,527
What did it feel like when it
was on you?

303
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:19,563
Well, yeah, a dream came true.

304
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:24,068
A dream did come true.
This is, like, it's beautiful.

305
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,036
I mean, you're very
beautiful too,

306
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:28,339
so, I'm sure it looked very--

307
00:23:28,341 --> 00:23:31,208
I'm sure it looked like it
belonged on you.

308
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,877
Thanks.

309
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:34,912
I mean it.

310
00:23:39,986 --> 00:23:42,353
Oh, I think we have to go.

311
00:23:42,355 --> 00:23:43,821
- Can I have my --
- Okay. Yeah, of course.

312
00:23:43,823 --> 00:23:46,424
- Thanks. Sorry.
- No problem.

313
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:50,828
Congratul--
Congrats again.

314
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,029
- <i>Thanks.</i>
<i>-</i> Thank you.

315
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:54,231
Okay, bye, have fun.

316
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:56,133
Bye. Bye.

317
00:24:12,185 --> 00:24:13,717
Hi.

318
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:15,419
I don't have an appointment,

319
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:18,289
but, I was hoping
that I might be able to,

320
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:19,857
see the dentist?

321
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:22,193
- Yes. When?
- Now.

322
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:25,296
- Okay.
- Okay.

323
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:27,031
Come and sit.

324
00:24:30,603 --> 00:24:32,136
Hi.

325
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:34,505
Hi.

326
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:37,208
Nice to see you again.
How are ya?

327
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:40,177
- I am well. How are you?
- What brings you here?

328
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:43,180
- I'm here to see the dentist.
- Hey!

329
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:45,115
- I'm the dentist.
- You are.

330
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:47,751
Nice to see you.
I said that already.

331
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:50,888
Uh, okay, take off your glove.

332
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,524
And, you know,
lose the jacket.

333
00:24:53,526 --> 00:24:57,561
<i>When was, uh, your last</i>
<i>dental checkup?</i>

334
00:24:57,563 --> 00:25:00,498
- Two months ago.
- <i>Two months ago, so you --</i>

335
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,668
But, but I've been,
since my race, eating...

336
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:08,072
an obscene amount of brownies.

337
00:25:08,074 --> 00:25:09,373
- <i>Right.</i>
- So I may have..

338
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:11,275
How quickly can you develop
a cavity?

339
00:25:11,277 --> 00:25:12,676
Can you have one in a day?

340
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:14,178
No, you can't get one in a day.

341
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,946
But I'll check you out.
It's better safe than sorry.

342
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:18,082
That's what I always say.
Always--

343
00:25:18,084 --> 00:25:20,150
Getting a checkup
never is a bad idea.

344
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:22,920
So let's take a look and --

345
00:25:22,922 --> 00:25:26,657
Why did you decide to come here?

346
00:25:27,927 --> 00:25:29,960
To the Olympics?

347
00:25:29,962 --> 00:25:32,229
'Cause, um...

348
00:25:34,467 --> 00:25:36,267
I love the Olympics.

349
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:39,203
Like, it's like,
since I was like--

350
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:42,740
I mean, I remember the
'88 Olympics, it was in Seoul.

351
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:45,509
- I wasn't even born.
- <i>You weren't even born yet.</i>

352
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:48,045
I read somewhere that, like,
they have volunteers

353
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,147
who are doctors and dentists,

354
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:52,516
and I had to apply,

355
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:54,752
and then I didn't hear anything
and I assumed I didn't get it.

356
00:25:54,754 --> 00:25:56,887
And then like a month ago
I heard, like, you --

357
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:59,223
- A month ago?
- Yeah. "You've been accepted," so..

358
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:02,192
How did you just come here then?

359
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:04,795
- You just left? Do you work?
- Do I work, yes, yeah.

360
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:07,731
I mean, are there people that
are sad now that you're gone?

361
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:10,768
Are there people that miss you,
whose teeth are--

362
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:13,971
That I couldn't tell you. Those
other people could tell you.

363
00:26:13,973 --> 00:26:16,040
I mean, are there patients,
my patients?

364
00:26:16,042 --> 00:26:18,242
No, the truth is I work at,
like, a clinic

365
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:19,543
where we get assigned patients.

366
00:26:19,545 --> 00:26:22,146
I don't have that many recurring
patients.

367
00:26:22,148 --> 00:26:23,747
I mean, I think people like
coming to me.

368
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,382
What about your family?

369
00:26:25,384 --> 00:26:27,284
Oh, my parents were really
psyched.

370
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:29,787
They knew I loved the Olympics
and they were thrilled

371
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:31,221
that I was gonna go do this.

372
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:33,190
What about your kids?

373
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:35,192
Oh, I don't have any kids.

374
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:39,129
Um, do you have a wife?

375
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:41,699
<i>I do not have a wife.</i>

376
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:43,467
<i>Um, I have..</i>

377
00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:46,470
A girlfriend?

378
00:26:46,472 --> 00:26:50,007
- <i>Um, I have a --</i>
- Boyfriend.

379
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:51,609
<i>No, no boyfriend.</i>

380
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:53,577
Um, there's a woman

381
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:56,747
um, in New Jersey

382
00:26:56,749 --> 00:26:59,917
named Kristi who is...

383
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,754
- <i>Does she know you're here?</i>
- She does know I'm here.

384
00:27:03,756 --> 00:27:05,856
But she doesn't know that,

385
00:27:05,858 --> 00:27:09,994
I can't seem to do my dental
examination, so...

386
00:27:09,996 --> 00:27:12,329
Everyone in New Jersey's asleep.

387
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:15,966
Great. Good to know. Okay.

388
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:18,268
What I'm doing now is checking

389
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,639
your lymph nodes
and your thyroid

390
00:27:21,641 --> 00:27:25,042
to just see if there's any sort
of, like, oral cancer.

391
00:27:25,044 --> 00:27:27,277
- Um..
- What are you doing later?

392
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,214
Uh, later I'm gonna
open your mouth

393
00:27:30,216 --> 00:27:32,683
and see if you have any
cavities.

394
00:27:32,685 --> 00:27:35,085
And what are you doing
after that?

395
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:39,590
I'm gonna see if there are any
more patients and then close up

396
00:27:39,592 --> 00:27:42,726
and probably get

397
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:44,561
some food or something.

398
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:46,196
I don't know.

399
00:27:49,235 --> 00:27:51,669
Do you wanna go to
the game room?

400
00:27:53,939 --> 00:27:56,206
Um...

401
00:27:56,942 --> 00:28:01,078
Uh, yeah. Sure.

402
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:10,921
So, this is, like, where
everybody, like, hangs out, huh?

403
00:28:10,923 --> 00:28:12,356
Yep. Yeah.

404
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:15,025
- <i>Do you wanna play foosball?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

405
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:17,194
Great. Um...

406
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:20,064
- Or we could play air hockey.
- Or --

407
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:21,565
Tiny pinball?

408
00:28:23,302 --> 00:28:25,436
Oh, you don't seem--
Oh, you wanna get a massage?

409
00:28:25,438 --> 00:28:28,372
Ooh, they've got those massage
chairs over here.

410
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:30,808
Do you wanna,
do you wanna get outta here?

411
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:36,146
Like, go to, like,
the dining hall or, like...

412
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:38,115
No, like, leave.

413
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:43,120
Like, leave the Olympic Village?

414
00:28:43,122 --> 00:28:47,124
Yeah, like not, like,
change out of my--

415
00:28:47,126 --> 00:28:49,693
out of our uniforms
and go do something.

416
00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:53,664
Like, go have a night out
together.

417
00:28:53,666 --> 00:28:57,267
- If you're free.
- In, like, like, in Korea?

418
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:59,269
Yes. Let's go out in Korea.

419
00:29:00,673 --> 00:29:03,407
- And I...
- Like, I haven't seen anything.

420
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,379
Thank you.

421
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:11,148
- You wanna go this way?
- Yeah.

422
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:13,417
Yeah, why would you wanna look
at Olympic rings

423
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:16,120
when you could look at
human skulls?

424
00:29:16,122 --> 00:29:20,057
<i>You think we're allowed to</i>
<i>light these things on fire?</i>

425
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:23,293
- Look at that.
- Well, have you done art stuff in the past?

426
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:24,361
No, I haven't done any art.

427
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:26,263
I have no creative side to me.

428
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:27,898
But I like art.

429
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:32,469
I have an idea.
Let's go eat Korean food.

430
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:35,038
Okay.
Anything but the dining hall.

431
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,507
You got it.

432
00:29:39,545 --> 00:29:43,914
- Well, what do you think?
- Yeah.

433
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:44,982
Two people.

434
00:29:44,984 --> 00:29:46,650
Can we sit here?
Thank you.

435
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:48,051
What about spicy noodles,
is that spicy?

436
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:49,820
The noodles are no spicy.

437
00:29:49,822 --> 00:29:51,288
Is this spicy?

438
00:29:52,825 --> 00:29:54,792
Whoa.

439
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:05,803
This is so hot.

440
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:07,371
This is great.

441
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:15,979
You wanna race?
Oh, I bet you do.

442
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:17,314
I bet you kinda wanna race.

443
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:20,584
I will beat you.
I will beat you.

444
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:22,019
- What is this?
- Let's go in.

445
00:30:22,021 --> 00:30:23,187
<i>What is it?</i>

446
00:30:23,189 --> 00:30:24,555
They're like athletes

447
00:30:24,557 --> 00:30:27,157
in the computer world.
Come on.

448
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:31,528
This is, like,
their training center.

449
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:33,530
<i>What I'm wondering is where are</i>
<i>all the girls?</i>

450
00:30:33,532 --> 00:30:35,332
<i>Like, are there any girls here?</i>

451
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,935
- I don't know.
- I see one. I see a girl.

452
00:30:37,937 --> 00:30:40,737
I mean, this reminds me of,
like, the saddest years of my,

453
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:43,240
like, middle school
and high school.

454
00:30:43,242 --> 00:30:47,444
Like, playing video games
with my friends.

455
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:50,714
You don't get it.
You really don't get it.

456
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:54,218
<i>I guess they're, like,</i>
<i>super-competitive like you are?</i>

457
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,886
Yes! And they're dedicated.

458
00:30:55,888 --> 00:31:00,190
Like, they're down here doing
whatever their thing is.

459
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:03,827
Like, it's awesome, right?

460
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:05,562
It's, like, so cool.

461
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:07,931
Like, are--what are you
laughing--

462
00:31:07,933 --> 00:31:10,367
- Are you laughing?
- I just get a kick out of you.

463
00:32:00,486 --> 00:32:01,885
<i>She was in college.</i>

464
00:32:01,887 --> 00:32:03,420
But you came home from school
to go to prom?

465
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:05,022
Yeah, I had a crush on her.
I thought maybe

466
00:32:05,024 --> 00:32:07,791
if I went to the prom with her,
you know...

467
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:10,894
something would happen.
But it didn't.

468
00:32:10,896 --> 00:32:14,898
- Didn't happen.
- It did not happen.

469
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:18,902
- Did you go to your prom?
- No.

470
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:21,872
I, I had a race

471
00:32:21,874 --> 00:32:23,640
in New Zealand and I--

472
00:32:24,977 --> 00:32:29,146
I didn't feel like

473
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:32,716
missing the race for prom.

474
00:32:32,718 --> 00:32:35,319
- I missed every homecoming.
- Oh, man.

475
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:37,487
I missed homecoming.

476
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:41,458
I missed everybody's

477
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:46,263
birthday party,
everybody's Bar Mitzvah,

478
00:32:46,265 --> 00:32:49,266
everybody's everything.

479
00:32:49,268 --> 00:32:53,704
But you've competed in the
Olympics.

480
00:32:53,706 --> 00:32:55,639
Like, wasn't this like--

481
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:58,909
- It was awesome.
- Yeah.

482
00:32:58,911 --> 00:33:01,778
And now it's over.

483
00:33:05,184 --> 00:33:06,650
But, like, is it over?

484
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:08,385
I mean, does it have to be over?

485
00:33:08,387 --> 00:33:10,654
- You can go back, right?
- Yeah.

486
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:13,323
I've no plans and--

487
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:16,026
That's okay.

488
00:33:16,028 --> 00:33:18,362
No, it's not.

489
00:33:18,364 --> 00:33:21,064
People who don't have plans
end up, like--

490
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:24,568
- Becoming dentists?
- No, you went to school.

491
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:28,772
People without plans end up moving back in with their parents.

492
00:33:28,774 --> 00:33:31,208
Can you imagine moving back in
with your parents?

493
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:33,276
- Free food.
- I am not--

494
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:37,647
- Laundry.
- You don't know my...

495
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:40,817
I love my dad but I'm...

496
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:42,119
Don't need to move back
in with him.

497
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:43,420
I can't, I don't know

498
00:33:43,422 --> 00:33:45,622
what the fuck I'm gonna do.

499
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:47,424
How old are you, 22?

500
00:33:47,426 --> 00:33:49,159
- Twenty-two.
- Twenty-two.

501
00:33:49,161 --> 00:33:52,029
You got your whole life ahead of
you to figure it out

502
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:55,065
like, maybe you're gonna become
a professional dancer.

503
00:33:55,067 --> 00:33:57,267
Perhaps you'll go off and become

504
00:33:57,269 --> 00:34:00,604
a StarCraft East Board Champion.

505
00:34:00,606 --> 00:34:02,372
Or maybe you'll just,
like, go, like

506
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:06,676
work in like a chicken factory,
or like--

507
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:08,345
- Flowers.
- Flowers.

508
00:34:08,347 --> 00:34:10,347
Maybe you'll grow flowers
in like

509
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:12,983
an old storage container

510
00:34:12,985 --> 00:34:16,887
that they've transitioned, like,
an organic flower thing.

511
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:19,990
Or, maybe, you'll work
for a food co-op or,

512
00:34:19,992 --> 00:34:23,326
maybe you'll go become a
high-powered executive

513
00:34:23,328 --> 00:34:26,063
for a sneaker company.

514
00:34:26,065 --> 00:34:30,567
Or maybe you'll just, like,
sit at home and eat Doritos

515
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:34,037
for, like, two years and put on,
like, 300 pounds.

516
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:39,342
Or maybe you'll
make fake throw vests.

517
00:34:39,344 --> 00:34:42,979
Or just be okay.

518
00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:04,868
<i>Hey, exclamation point.</i>

519
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:07,637
I just saw your text,
exclamation point.

520
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:11,341
Sorry about that,
exclamation point.

521
00:35:11,343 --> 00:35:12,909
Everything is cool here

522
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:17,881
and I am really happy
to hear from you

523
00:35:17,883 --> 00:35:21,685
exclamation point, exclamation
point, exclamation point.

524
00:35:21,687 --> 00:35:23,653
Is this too many
exclamation points

525
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:26,556
question mark,
exclamation point?

526
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,493
Uh, bye.

527
00:35:29,495 --> 00:35:31,495
But also, hi.

528
00:35:32,598 --> 00:35:34,197
Exclamation point.

529
00:35:48,714 --> 00:35:50,413
- Ezra!
- Hi.

530
00:35:50,415 --> 00:35:51,948
I see you everywhere.

531
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:55,652
Do you wanna come with me to
some games or something?

532
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:59,723
Like, some practices,
sneak around a little bit?

533
00:35:59,725 --> 00:36:03,226
Oh, that sounds awesome.

534
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:06,830
I feel like I should just
take care of, like

535
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:08,431
laundry-ish kind of
stuff today, but--

536
00:36:08,433 --> 00:36:11,801
- Yeah, yeah, okay.
- But thank you, that's so --

537
00:36:11,803 --> 00:36:15,772
No, it's not like you can't

538
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:19,843
do laundry at any other day
of your life.

539
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:24,548
But today I am inviting you to
literally go backstage

540
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:28,385
on the ice, like, whatever
you want with my athlete pass,

541
00:36:28,387 --> 00:36:29,553
and you're saying no.

542
00:36:29,555 --> 00:36:32,589
- Okay, okay, I'll go.
- Right?

543
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,660
Whoa.

544
00:36:36,662 --> 00:36:40,530
I can't even fathom doing this.

545
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:43,833
- This is crazy.
- This is, like..

546
00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:48,104
Do you think anyone watches me
race and thinks

547
00:36:48,106 --> 00:36:49,439
this is amazing?

548
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:52,576
Yeah, those ski jumpers,
they can't do what you do

549
00:36:52,578 --> 00:36:54,144
and you can't do what they do

550
00:36:54,146 --> 00:36:56,313
and that's what makes this all
so special.

551
00:36:56,315 --> 00:36:59,649
Could you imagine,
like if your life depended on it, could you do that?

552
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:00,784
Oh, I definitely couldn't.

553
00:37:00,786 --> 00:37:02,252
You know, this guy I sat next to

554
00:37:02,254 --> 00:37:04,421
in the dining hall
the other day he does this.

555
00:37:04,423 --> 00:37:07,624
And he was just sitting there
eating a hamburger.

556
00:37:13,298 --> 00:37:15,832
<i>These are the bravest women</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

557
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:19,169
<i>Like, they are so committed.</i>

558
00:37:19,171 --> 00:37:21,871
Like, once they go,
they are going.

559
00:37:21,873 --> 00:37:23,673
- Yeah.
- They can't stop.

560
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:27,143
<i>They're just gonna throw</i>
<i>themselves down</i>

561
00:37:27,145 --> 00:37:30,680
<i>like an ice slide head first.</i>

562
00:37:30,682 --> 00:37:33,450
<i>Also, who knows what they're</i>
<i>like in their personal lives?</i>

563
00:37:33,452 --> 00:37:35,819
Like, maybe they're scared of
stuff in their real life.

564
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:38,488
But on, when they're
doing skeleton

565
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:40,857
it's just balls to the wall.

566
00:37:43,262 --> 00:37:44,561
I would just, like, fall.

567
00:37:44,563 --> 00:37:46,062
I feel like I would fall before
I even got on the ice.

568
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:49,199
No, I feel like I get it.
I feel like I--

569
00:37:49,201 --> 00:37:50,934
- You feel like you could do it?
- I don't know.

570
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:54,771
I just, I know that feeling
a little bit of, like,

571
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:57,007
- I know that feeling.
- Yeah.

572
00:37:57,009 --> 00:38:00,610
Everything has a purpose in this
sport. Each shoe has a purpose.

573
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:04,347
The broom, like,
they're like little well-oiled machines with each other.

574
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:08,685
<i>And two people who know,</i>
<i>like, who they are</i>

575
00:38:08,687 --> 00:38:13,323
<i>and they're there for each other,</i>
<i>but they also are confident.</i>

576
00:38:13,325 --> 00:38:14,858
I'm reading a lot into this,
as you can see.

577
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,293
It's good, it's not bad.

578
00:38:16,295 --> 00:38:17,927
<i>And you know that they work</i>
<i>full-time</i>

579
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:19,296
<i>right, a lot of them?</i>

580
00:38:19,298 --> 00:38:22,065
So you could do it,
you know, like, you..

581
00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:23,700
Sorry.

582
00:38:32,077 --> 00:38:36,446
Do you think that they're
banging?

583
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:38,081
<i>Do you think that they ever</i>
<i>have, or do you..</i>

584
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:40,350
<i>I mean, you've gotta figure</i>

585
00:38:40,352 --> 00:38:43,019
<i>some of these couples</i>
<i>are together, right?</i>

586
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,065
Come on.

587
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:14,517
- I've made dinner.
- Okay.

588
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,753
No, we're going out tonight.

589
00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:30,533
- Cocoa.
- Hot chocolate.

590
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:33,303
- Thank you.
- Hot chocolate!

591
00:39:33,305 --> 00:39:37,240
It's like... It smells like
a cartoon of hot chocolate

592
00:39:37,242 --> 00:39:40,443
you know, it smells, like,
perfect.

593
00:39:40,445 --> 00:39:42,779
- Cheers.
- Thank you.

594
00:39:42,781 --> 00:39:45,749
You're very good at making
people feel

595
00:39:45,751 --> 00:39:47,884
good going to the dentist.

596
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:50,920
- Like, I had...
- You had a pleasant experience?

597
00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:52,155
I had a very pleasant
experience.

598
00:39:52,157 --> 00:39:53,790
Your experience with me
at the dentist.

599
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:55,558
- Yeah. It's like, you're not afraid..
- Thank you.

600
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,927
- So I'm not afraid sort of thing.
- Oh, good.

601
00:39:57,929 --> 00:40:00,830
<i>That's nice.</i>
<i>That's nice to hear.</i>

602
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:03,233
I just don't like my office.

603
00:40:03,235 --> 00:40:04,968
Why, 'cause it's
not really yours?

604
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:10,073
I don't like where I work.
I don't like... I'm not...

605
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:13,910
- What do you want?
- Um, what do I want?

606
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:18,348
I would like to have like
a family practice that I,

607
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:20,283
you know, start with a kid
who's, like, little,

608
00:40:20,285 --> 00:40:22,919
and watch him grow up
and send him off to college,

609
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:25,054
and, I mean, not personally.

610
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:26,423
Like, I'd let his parents send
him to college.

611
00:40:26,425 --> 00:40:29,692
<i>But, like,</i>
<i>I want like a Ms. Pacman</i>

612
00:40:29,694 --> 00:40:31,294
in -- in the waiting room.

613
00:40:31,296 --> 00:40:36,399
And, that feels more, like,
personal.

614
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,304
That's awesome. That's--

615
00:40:41,306 --> 00:40:43,807
I feel like you can hear someone
say something and you can be

616
00:40:43,809 --> 00:40:45,542
like, he has a complaint
or he has a goal.

617
00:40:45,544 --> 00:40:49,045
And I'm choosing to hear that
you have a goal.

618
00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:52,816
That you have your own thing
one day.

619
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:55,952
- <i>That's--</i>
- What about you?

620
00:40:55,954 --> 00:41:01,558
I'm also figuring out
what my goal is.

621
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:06,963
Like, it can be that I commit to
another Olympics cycle

622
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:12,368
and do it for four more years,
or I don't.

623
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:16,606
How could you not?
You're like a total badass.

624
00:41:16,608 --> 00:41:19,809
Like, you're like this, like..

625
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:22,512
Like this, like,
warrior princess.

626
00:41:22,514 --> 00:41:25,882
So whether you decide
to go do the Olympics

627
00:41:25,884 --> 00:41:27,383
or go do something else

628
00:41:27,385 --> 00:41:32,522
like, you know,
you're just, like--

629
00:41:32,524 --> 00:41:34,858
You'll be able to do it.

630
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,526
'Cause you're...

631
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:41,030
very talented.

632
00:41:43,702 --> 00:41:45,401
Thank you.

633
00:42:00,485 --> 00:42:02,085
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

634
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:09,025
Is everything okay?

635
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:12,562
- Well, it was, uh, was fine.
- Okay.

636
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:15,832
Uh...

637
00:42:15,834 --> 00:42:18,167
Do you wanna kiss me?

638
00:42:18,169 --> 00:42:19,802
Uh...

639
00:42:19,804 --> 00:42:23,373
It's not quite that simple.

640
00:42:24,676 --> 00:42:28,011
- It's pretty simple.
- It's kinda not.

641
00:42:29,414 --> 00:42:33,483
I have, like, a fiancee.
- <i>I thought you were on a break.</i>

642
00:42:33,485 --> 00:42:35,385
- We are, we're on a break --
- <i>So then this is all good.</i>

643
00:42:35,387 --> 00:42:36,920
But I don't know what
it's gonna be like!

644
00:42:36,922 --> 00:42:38,354
<i>Yeah, but it's like, who cares?</i>

645
00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:40,890
Like, we're just hanging out
and...

646
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:42,458
<i>I know. It's just, like,</i>

647
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:44,994
not as simple as, like,
'what do I want', like--

648
00:42:44,996 --> 00:42:46,696
No, it really is.
You just, like

649
00:42:46,698 --> 00:42:48,965
pick things that you
wanna do and you do them.

650
00:42:48,967 --> 00:42:53,603
It's easy for you to
have that philosophy,

651
00:42:53,605 --> 00:42:58,408
because, you're, like,
this Olympic athlete

652
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:02,712
who's, like, sort of
gets to be a little more

653
00:43:02,714 --> 00:43:05,648
<i>selfish with how you choose to</i>
<i>do the things you do,</i>

654
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:07,984
<i>where you're, like,</i>
<i>I need to eat, I need to sleep,</i>

655
00:43:07,986 --> 00:43:09,719
<i>I need to kiss,</i>
<i>I need to do whatever.</i>

656
00:43:09,721 --> 00:43:12,722
And you, like, go after your
goal and you do your thing--

657
00:43:12,724 --> 00:43:15,992
<i>That's, like, so insulting,</i>
<i>Ezra.</i>

658
00:43:15,994 --> 00:43:17,961
<i>I'm telling you what I want.</i>

659
00:43:17,963 --> 00:43:20,597
And I'm getting back from you

660
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:23,132
that you don't even know
what you want.

661
00:43:23,134 --> 00:43:26,669
And that's really dumb,

662
00:43:26,671 --> 00:43:28,671
and not brave.

663
00:43:30,475 --> 00:43:35,111
- It's like, it's cowardly.
- Okay. Okay.

664
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:39,248
Well, if you decide, like,
you don't wanna continue going to the Olympics,

665
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:41,084
you could maybe become
a psychotherapist,

666
00:43:41,086 --> 00:43:43,219
'cause, you've clearly diagnosed
me.

667
00:43:43,221 --> 00:43:47,390
No, that is really mean.

668
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:52,061
But, calling me not brave isn't?

669
00:43:56,101 --> 00:43:58,167
I wanna go home.

670
00:43:58,169 --> 00:44:00,970
Great. Well, you're leaving in
three days, so...

671
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:04,207
- To the Village.
- Even better.

672
00:45:15,714 --> 00:45:18,214
- Excuse me, can I sit here?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

673
00:45:35,166 --> 00:45:37,433
- Hey!
- Hey. Did I forget something?

674
00:45:37,435 --> 00:45:39,936
- Yeah, I know, here's a--
- I'm in a rush. I need to re--

675
00:45:39,938 --> 00:45:41,771
Yeah, no. I just wanted to give
you a toothbrush.

676
00:45:41,773 --> 00:45:43,139
Oh, thank you, so kind.

677
00:45:43,141 --> 00:45:44,674
So, if you've got
anything you need--

678
00:45:44,676 --> 00:45:46,709
- Okay, I'll just walk with you.
- Alright.

679
00:45:46,711 --> 00:45:48,678
Does the Turkish team

680
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,280
need a dentist or anything like
a full-time dentist?

681
00:45:51,282 --> 00:45:52,548
No, no, sorry.

682
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:54,751
- I like your boots.
- <i>Oh, you like?</i>

683
00:45:54,753 --> 00:45:56,486
Yeah. They're cool.

684
00:45:56,488 --> 00:45:59,021
This is a Japanese
official uniform.

685
00:45:59,023 --> 00:46:00,089
Okay, yeah.

686
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:03,793
Do you know is the Japanese team

687
00:46:03,795 --> 00:46:05,294
looking for a dentist?

688
00:46:06,631 --> 00:46:10,700
No, no, sorry.
Nobody wants a dentist now.

689
00:46:10,702 --> 00:46:13,002
- No.
- <i>Sorry.</i>

690
00:46:13,004 --> 00:46:15,338
That's okay.
Nobody wants a dentist.

691
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:16,773
Except when they got a cavity.

692
00:46:23,081 --> 00:46:25,248
- Do you speak English?
- Yes.

693
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:26,549
- You do?
- Yes.

694
00:46:26,551 --> 00:46:28,151
- Is anyone sitting here?
- Nope.

695
00:46:28,153 --> 00:46:30,319
- Do you mind if I do?
- I don't mind.

696
00:46:30,321 --> 00:46:32,822
Okay. Or laying down here,
I should say.

697
00:46:32,824 --> 00:46:37,093
That one is, like,
pre-loaded for you.

698
00:46:37,095 --> 00:46:38,895
Take a nap really quick.

699
00:46:38,897 --> 00:46:40,163
- How's it goin'?
- Good.

700
00:46:40,165 --> 00:46:41,564
- I'm Gus. - Penelope.
- Penelope.

701
00:46:41,566 --> 00:46:43,132
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

702
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:44,534
What sport are you?

703
00:46:44,536 --> 00:46:46,502
Ski slope style. And you?

704
00:46:46,504 --> 00:46:49,639
I am cross-country skiing
and I feel embarrassed,

705
00:46:49,641 --> 00:46:51,407
but, have you...

706
00:46:51,409 --> 00:46:52,675
- Competed yet?
- Yeah.

707
00:46:52,677 --> 00:46:54,143
- No, a couple of days.
- Okay.

708
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:56,078
- Have you?
- I'm done.

709
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,481
How did it go?

710
00:46:58,483 --> 00:47:01,584
Uh, it was-- It was...

711
00:47:01,586 --> 00:47:04,187
Sorry, this thing is..
Do you know how these..

712
00:47:07,425 --> 00:47:09,625
I get--
I think I just turned it off.

713
00:47:09,627 --> 00:47:13,095
Um, I don't speak Korean, no.

714
00:47:13,097 --> 00:47:14,931
- I will figure this out.
- I just pushed some buttons.

715
00:47:14,933 --> 00:47:18,501
Okay, yeah, I'll just,
whatever. Um, I..

716
00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:20,369
I feel like this is a good
choice.

717
00:47:20,371 --> 00:47:22,905
Yes, the neck massage.

718
00:47:22,907 --> 00:47:25,608
- I did a personal best.
- That's awesome.

719
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:28,411
Yes, it is all I can ask for,
I think.

720
00:47:28,413 --> 00:47:30,213
- Congrats.
- Thank you.

721
00:47:30,215 --> 00:47:33,916
Well, if you feel like
celebrating

722
00:47:33,918 --> 00:47:36,853
a bunch of guys in my building
are having a party tonight.

723
00:47:36,855 --> 00:47:39,956
Um, I don't know if that
interests you

724
00:47:39,958 --> 00:47:42,558
but I was sent out to bring back
cute girls.

725
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:47,196
So, I figured at the least
I could invite you.

726
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:49,732
- I would come.
- Yeah, you wanna come?

727
00:47:49,734 --> 00:47:51,267
Yeah, yes, I do.

728
00:47:55,607 --> 00:47:57,173
- Hi.
- I know.

729
00:47:57,175 --> 00:47:58,941
I'm gonna do another one.

730
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:03,746
- How's it goin'?
- It's good.

731
00:48:03,748 --> 00:48:06,716
- Are you done competing?
- <i>I have one more event.</i>

732
00:48:06,718 --> 00:48:09,685
- We figure earlier today.
- <i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

733
00:48:09,687 --> 00:48:12,788
It was frickin' crazy.
Fell on my first run.

734
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:14,924
Was just, like,
a little shooken up.

735
00:48:14,926 --> 00:48:18,027
And then, thankfully, put it
down on my second run.

736
00:48:18,029 --> 00:48:21,430
<i>I'm done competing and I'm</i>
<i>gonna try to enjoy tonight.</i>

737
00:48:21,432 --> 00:48:22,965
Well, good!

738
00:48:22,967 --> 00:48:25,167
I'm so grateful my boyfriend's
here, so I like --

739
00:48:25,169 --> 00:48:28,037
- <i>Oh, he's a snowboarder?</i>
- He's a snowboarder.

740
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:31,307
So I feel like that would be so,
like, hard, but awesome..

741
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:33,175
- Because they get it, you know.
- <i>Exactly.</i>

742
00:48:33,177 --> 00:48:36,178
<i>We live such different lives,</i>
<i>it's hard for people</i>

743
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:39,282
to really comprehend
what's going on.

744
00:48:39,284 --> 00:48:43,886
Yeah, it's a lifestyle and not
everyone understands it, right?

745
00:48:43,888 --> 00:48:46,355
Maybe you'll meet your future
man here.

746
00:48:46,357 --> 00:48:48,291
Maybe I will.

747
00:49:05,643 --> 00:49:08,177
It's hard to miss when you're
putting your face into stuff.

748
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:10,947
Yeah, but, like, come on.
Like, I'll get the next one.

749
00:49:10,949 --> 00:49:12,882
<i>That's what I do.</i>

750
00:49:12,884 --> 00:49:15,918
I'm happy to be here, but I'm not, like,
super thrilled with my race.

751
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:19,722
And I feel like I can admit that to you 'cause you probably get it.

752
00:49:19,724 --> 00:49:22,825
- Not everyone gets that.
- I mean, that sucks.

753
00:49:22,827 --> 00:49:25,227
That's how, that's like the
hardest part of the sport thing.

754
00:49:25,229 --> 00:49:26,662
- You get it.
- Yeah..

755
00:49:26,664 --> 00:49:28,664
I mean, you work four years,
longer than that.

756
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:32,001
You have to remember that you
made it. Like, you did it.

757
00:49:32,003 --> 00:49:33,569
- You're an Olympian.
- That's true.

758
00:49:33,571 --> 00:49:35,504
- You'll always be an Olympian.
- You too.

759
00:49:35,506 --> 00:49:38,541
I got the, I have a tattoo,
so I'm always--

760
00:49:38,543 --> 00:49:40,409
- An Olympic one?
- Yeah, yeah.

761
00:49:40,411 --> 00:49:41,877
- Let me see it.
- Do you--

762
00:49:41,879 --> 00:49:43,579
- Where is it?
- It's on my arm.

763
00:49:43,581 --> 00:49:45,081
Oh, I have one on my arm, too.

764
00:49:45,083 --> 00:49:47,550
- Oh, my God, same.
- That's where yours is?

765
00:49:47,552 --> 00:49:49,418
Yeah, but I'm wearing
a real bra

766
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:50,920
because I never do.

767
00:49:50,922 --> 00:49:52,221
Oochie. That's okay.

768
00:49:52,223 --> 00:49:56,392
Okay. Um, it is..

769
00:49:56,394 --> 00:49:58,928
- Oh, yeah.
- Not bad?

770
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:00,062
That's awesome.

771
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:02,631
- Twins.
- Twins.

772
00:50:03,534 --> 00:50:06,602
Is it okay, um, if I...

773
00:50:09,374 --> 00:50:10,940
Um...

774
00:50:14,145 --> 00:50:16,579
- I'm-- I'm gay.
- Oh.

775
00:50:16,581 --> 00:50:19,215
- I-- I'm sorry, I thought--
- I didn't even see.

776
00:50:19,217 --> 00:50:20,950
- I wouldn't have even known.
- I thought maybe you realized.

777
00:50:20,952 --> 00:50:22,385
I-- I'm sorry.

778
00:50:22,387 --> 00:50:25,054
- I hope I didn't lead you on.
- No, it's okay, you didn't.

779
00:50:25,056 --> 00:50:27,189
Um, I just...

780
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:31,894
I'm having a really hard time
here and I just really...

781
00:50:31,896 --> 00:50:34,597
I really need someone to kiss me
right now.

782
00:50:34,599 --> 00:50:36,932
Like, I really need
someone to kiss me.

783
00:50:36,934 --> 00:50:40,836
I know that you're not
attracted to me and it's--

784
00:50:47,845 --> 00:50:51,881
Thank you.
That's what I needed.

785
00:50:51,883 --> 00:50:53,749
- You okay?
- I'm good.

786
00:50:53,751 --> 00:50:56,318
I'm sorry that I asked you
to do that.

787
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:59,588
That's okay. I'm sorry if I gave
you the wrong impression.

788
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:01,824
- No. Are we cool?
- Yeah, we're cool. You good?

789
00:51:01,826 --> 00:51:04,026
I'm good if you're good.
I'm really good if you're good.

790
00:51:04,028 --> 00:51:05,428
- I'm good.
- Okay.

791
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:07,863
- Do you wanna go get food?
- Yeah. You're really good.

792
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:13,135
There are so many people out
tonight.

793
00:51:13,137 --> 00:51:16,705
I know. Like you'd think it'd be dead after 9:00,
but it's, like--

794
00:51:16,707 --> 00:51:19,542
Most people are probably done
competing.

795
00:51:21,345 --> 00:51:24,213
- Are you just having milk?
- Yes.

796
00:51:24,215 --> 00:51:25,548
You don't drink milk?

797
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:27,883
Not after I've been drinking
other stuff.

798
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,686
- How 'bout this guy?
- Cross-country skiing.

799
00:51:30,688 --> 00:51:31,921
Cross-country skiing,
I agree with that.

800
00:51:31,923 --> 00:51:33,589
I can identify
my own very easily.

801
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:36,459
Guy right here, this guy.
Right here, Norway.

802
00:51:36,461 --> 00:51:38,627
Aerials. He's tiny.

803
00:51:38,629 --> 00:51:41,597
Okay, you're better at this than me.
Because, like, I wouldn't have--

804
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:42,998
I mean, I don't know,
but that's my guess.

805
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,733
This guy, skiing...

806
00:51:44,735 --> 00:51:46,502
- He smiles, yeah.
- Oh, he just smiled at you.

807
00:51:46,504 --> 00:51:47,703
I don't know.

808
00:51:47,705 --> 00:51:49,705
Hey, what about this guy?

809
00:51:51,509 --> 00:51:53,809
- He's very strong.
- Honestly, I would.

810
00:51:53,811 --> 00:51:55,678
- What? Really?
- Yeah, think so.

811
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,613
- What's your type?
- Like, kind of that.

812
00:51:57,615 --> 00:51:59,682
At the last Olympics
one of the guys on my team

813
00:51:59,684 --> 00:52:01,250
lost his virginity
during the games.

814
00:52:01,252 --> 00:52:03,452
- Really?
- Yeah.

815
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:05,154
That's awesome!
That is so--

816
00:52:05,156 --> 00:52:06,722
Is it awesome
or is it embarrassing?

817
00:52:06,724 --> 00:52:08,891
No, that is, like,
way cooler than, like

818
00:52:08,893 --> 00:52:11,794
on your parents', like,
floor or some, I don't wanna--

819
00:52:11,796 --> 00:52:13,395
Like in the bathroom
at some high school party.

820
00:52:13,397 --> 00:52:15,331
Yeah. It's so romantic.

821
00:52:15,333 --> 00:52:18,567
Like, this place is romantic.

822
00:52:25,676 --> 00:52:27,843
- Hey, are you the dentist guy?
- Yeah.

823
00:52:27,845 --> 00:52:29,979
Ah, you, do you have any more
floss on you, by any chance?

824
00:52:29,981 --> 00:52:32,815
Oh, sure. Yeah.

825
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:35,351
- Um, have you guys..
- Whoa!

826
00:52:35,353 --> 00:52:37,887
- Yeah, maybe you could split those up.
- Thank you.

827
00:52:37,889 --> 00:52:39,855
Have you guys
competed already? Or...

828
00:52:39,857 --> 00:52:42,057
No, we're, we're going to,
we gotta run. We're kinda..

829
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:44,226
- Oh, cool! Well, good luck to you.
- Thanks.

830
00:52:44,228 --> 00:52:46,061
- What's your race, what are yo --
- Skeleton.

831
00:52:46,063 --> 00:52:50,065
Oh, wow, that's so cool. Wow.
Alright, well, good luck.

832
00:52:50,067 --> 00:52:52,801
And maybe I'll come see you guys
at the race or something.

833
00:52:52,803 --> 00:52:54,003
In a couple of days.
We gotta jam.

834
00:52:54,005 --> 00:52:56,672
Okay, alright.
Take care, guys.

835
00:53:00,645 --> 00:53:02,545
Would you hook up with that guy?

836
00:53:02,547 --> 00:53:05,047
- Um, that guy.
- With the coffee?

837
00:53:05,049 --> 00:53:07,716
- I--
- I think he's cute, actually.

838
00:53:07,718 --> 00:53:08,884
He's kind of looking at you,
too.

839
00:53:08,886 --> 00:53:13,622
That guy is a--
Named Ezra.

840
00:53:13,624 --> 00:53:15,925
- He is a dentist.
- So you know him.

841
00:53:15,927 --> 00:53:17,626
Ezra!

842
00:53:17,628 --> 00:53:19,361
- Hello.
- Hello.

843
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:20,763
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

844
00:53:20,765 --> 00:53:22,431
- You're here late.
- Hi.

845
00:53:22,433 --> 00:53:23,699
How's it goin'? I'm Gus.

846
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:24,900
- Hi, I'm Ezra.
- This is Gus.

847
00:53:24,902 --> 00:53:26,168
Oh, what happened to your hand?

848
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:27,703
I just broke my thumb
the other day.

849
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:28,837
- It's not a big deal.
- Are you okay?

850
00:53:28,839 --> 00:53:30,439
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Good.

851
00:53:30,441 --> 00:53:31,774
- Hi.
- Good to see you.

852
00:53:31,776 --> 00:53:33,776
- Are you okay?
- I'm great.

853
00:53:33,778 --> 00:53:36,378
- It's late.
- Yeah.

854
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:39,215
You have a good night?
- <i>How many teeth did you clean today?</i>

855
00:53:39,217 --> 00:53:42,585
<i>- He cleans a lot of teeth.</i>
<i>- So strange.</i>

856
00:53:42,587 --> 00:53:44,753
Ah, alright,
I'm gonna leave you guys to it.

857
00:53:44,755 --> 00:53:46,155
<i>You don't have to,</i>
<i>you're welcome to join.</i>

858
00:53:46,157 --> 00:53:48,757
- It's okay.
- <i>Do you have any floss on you?</i>

859
00:53:48,759 --> 00:53:50,492
I don't have any on me,
I'm sorry.

860
00:53:50,494 --> 00:53:51,827
It was really nice to meet you.

861
00:53:51,829 --> 00:53:52,962
<i>Yeah, it was nice to meet you,</i>
<i>too.</i>

862
00:53:52,964 --> 00:53:54,597
- Have a good night.
- <i>Okay.</i>

863
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:56,999
You too. Bye.

864
00:53:57,001 --> 00:53:59,468
- Oh, my God.
- I know him.

865
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:02,504
- You were so rude.
- No, I wasn't.

866
00:54:02,506 --> 00:54:04,640
"How many teeth
did you clean today?"

867
00:54:04,642 --> 00:54:06,875
He cleans teeth.
It's like saying how many runs..

868
00:54:06,877 --> 00:54:09,345
- I know, but...
- How many hours did you train?

869
00:54:09,347 --> 00:54:10,713
No, if you said how long did you
work today,

870
00:54:10,715 --> 00:54:11,947
that would be the same thing.

871
00:54:11,949 --> 00:54:13,515
But how many teeth
did you clean?

872
00:54:13,517 --> 00:54:15,084
It's so patronizing.

873
00:54:16,387 --> 00:54:18,320
- You totally like him.
- No.

874
00:54:18,322 --> 00:54:19,888
I got crazy energy.

875
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:21,156
Or you guys are hooking up
or you already did or something.

876
00:54:21,158 --> 00:54:24,426
No. No.
None. None of the above.

877
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:27,763
Only... Nothing.

878
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:29,798
- Only floss.
- I don't believe you.

879
00:54:31,736 --> 00:54:33,335
Oh, my God, you're blushing.

880
00:54:35,673 --> 00:54:37,840
Soy milk.
Not my favorite kind of milk.

881
00:54:37,842 --> 00:54:39,275
Yeah, it's soy milky.

882
00:55:07,138 --> 00:55:09,838
Ah, Kristi. Hi.

883
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:13,375
Oh, I can't,
I can't hear what--

884
00:55:13,377 --> 00:55:15,311
I can't hear--

885
00:55:15,313 --> 00:55:18,147
I, uh, it's very bad reception
in here, let me...

886
00:55:19,417 --> 00:55:22,885
Hi! Sorry, the reception's
terrible in there.

887
00:55:22,887 --> 00:55:27,089
So, just, um,
it's wild over here.

888
00:55:27,091 --> 00:55:30,559
I mean, it's freezing,
but it's been really..

889
00:55:30,561 --> 00:55:33,395
Oh, um, oh, yes.

890
00:55:33,397 --> 00:55:36,332
Ah, it's not broken,
you just need to unplug it

891
00:55:36,334 --> 00:55:39,068
and then plug it back in.

892
00:55:39,070 --> 00:55:41,804
And then there'll be, like,
a yellow light.

893
00:55:41,806 --> 00:55:46,608
Um, so, how's that going, good?

894
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:50,346
Okay, great.
So, uh, how've you been?

895
00:55:50,348 --> 00:55:55,451
How -- how are things? Oh.
Oh, yeah, no, I'll let you go.

896
00:55:55,453 --> 00:55:58,821
Okay. Ah, sure.

897
00:56:06,197 --> 00:56:08,097
<i>- So you're from Greece?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

898
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:10,966
As you see, a lot of blue,
white, everywhere.

899
00:56:10,968 --> 00:56:12,368
- <i>That's so cool.</i>
- Yeah.

900
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:15,137
I've always wanted to go
swimming in Greece.

901
00:56:15,139 --> 00:56:18,006
And my-- and my fiancee, my--

902
00:56:19,577 --> 00:56:21,043
Yes, I understand.

903
00:56:21,045 --> 00:56:23,912
She, I, she loves,
she says she loves the beach,

904
00:56:23,914 --> 00:56:25,381
and I'm, like,
"Well, let's go to Greece"

905
00:56:25,383 --> 00:56:27,483
and then she's like,
"Let's just go to Miami."

906
00:56:27,485 --> 00:56:30,352
- Oh, no.
- And it's like, I don't wanna go... I wanna go to Greece.

907
00:56:30,354 --> 00:56:32,354
- Can I ask you honestly?
- Yes?

908
00:56:32,356 --> 00:56:36,225
So, we were together
and then we were engaged,

909
00:56:36,227 --> 00:56:40,429
and then I said, "I might wanna
go to the Olympics."

910
00:56:40,431 --> 00:56:41,897
Asked if she wanted to go.

911
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:44,333
She doesn't, she never wants to
leave the country.

912
00:56:44,335 --> 00:56:46,335
She's scared of going to other
countries.

913
00:56:46,337 --> 00:56:49,471
- And you like traveling.
- I like to travel.

914
00:56:49,473 --> 00:56:51,240
Oh.

915
00:56:51,242 --> 00:56:54,443
I don't know, I think you didn't
choose the right girlfriend.

916
00:56:57,114 --> 00:56:58,280
Yeah.

917
00:56:58,282 --> 00:56:59,848
So what's going on?
Why are you here?

918
00:57:01,552 --> 00:57:05,988
Okay. Well, you've got a,
so for the... What's the...

919
00:57:08,025 --> 00:57:10,392
Okay, that tooth is..
Sorry.

920
00:57:10,394 --> 00:57:12,761
It's molar hurts.
Molar hurts.

921
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:14,930
This, which one?

922
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:16,698
When was the last time
you saw the dentist?

923
00:57:18,369 --> 00:57:21,970
- What does that mean?
- It's been a long time.

924
00:57:23,073 --> 00:57:25,174
- You speak English?
- Sometimes, yeah.

925
00:57:25,176 --> 00:57:26,975
But you understand Italian,
so it's not a problem.

926
00:57:26,977 --> 00:57:29,511
Yes, you're kind of just messing
with me a little bit.

927
00:57:29,513 --> 00:57:31,079
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Okay.

928
00:57:31,081 --> 00:57:32,881
- It's good?
- Yeah, it's funny.

929
00:57:32,883 --> 00:57:36,685
You really also should,
you should go to a dentist regularly.

930
00:57:36,687 --> 00:57:38,687
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Yeah.

931
00:57:38,689 --> 00:57:41,890
I'm sorry. I'm having a--
I'm not having a great day.

932
00:57:41,892 --> 00:57:43,859
- So, I apologize.
- Me too.

933
00:57:43,861 --> 00:57:45,127
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

934
00:58:31,809 --> 00:58:33,175
Hey.

935
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,213
Funny running into you here.

936
00:58:39,917 --> 00:58:41,483
- Everywhere.
- Yeah.

937
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,320
Ah, can we chat
for a few minutes?

938
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:48,724
Ah, I don't...

939
00:58:48,726 --> 00:58:51,593
I was gonna go in there
and just kinda wander around.

940
00:58:51,595 --> 00:58:55,664
Yeah, I-- I found like
a pretty cool spot.

941
00:58:55,666 --> 00:58:57,332
I think you'd really enjoy it.

942
00:58:58,936 --> 00:59:01,503
Hello. I just a..
I'm a volunteer.

943
00:59:01,505 --> 00:59:04,373
I -- I left something in here
that I need to get.

944
00:59:11,482 --> 00:59:13,215
It's pretty cool out here,
right?

945
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:15,951
It's, like, check it out,
it's still going.

946
00:59:15,953 --> 00:59:17,619
<i>It's like Hanukah!</i>

947
00:59:17,621 --> 00:59:20,656
The, the Festival of Lights.

948
00:59:22,593 --> 00:59:23,625
Um..

949
00:59:25,129 --> 00:59:27,829
If you can believe it,
I didn't bring you out here

950
00:59:27,831 --> 00:59:30,532
to talk about Hanukah.

951
00:59:31,168 --> 00:59:33,168
- Okay.
- Um...

952
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:37,673
I, I wanted to
apologize to you..

953
00:59:37,675 --> 00:59:41,243
...for how things went down
the other day

954
00:59:41,245 --> 00:59:47,015
at our chat,
whatever... that was.

955
00:59:47,418 --> 00:59:48,450
Um..

956
00:59:49,153 --> 00:59:50,552
In going back through it

957
00:59:50,554 --> 00:59:52,955
I didn't really like
kinda what I said

958
00:59:52,957 --> 00:59:54,623
or how I said it to you.

959
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:59,194
And I realize you were just
trying to encourage me

960
00:59:59,196 --> 01:00:03,765
and I've been trying to
figure out why

961
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:05,534
I kinda said what I said.

962
01:00:05,536 --> 01:00:08,670
And I think it's...

963
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:12,708
probably 'cause
I'm just sort of...

964
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:15,544
scared or afraid of stuff.

965
01:00:15,546 --> 01:00:19,081
Ezra, do you think
I'm not afraid?

966
01:00:20,517 --> 01:00:25,787
Like, I wasn't trying to say,
"Don't have fear."

967
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:28,590
Like, I wake up every day
a little bit afraid.

968
01:00:28,592 --> 01:00:32,394
But it's the good fear.
It's like afraid for how well it can go.

969
01:00:32,396 --> 01:00:37,132
And what I was hearing from you
very and clearly,

970
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:39,134
is that you want things.

971
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:42,537
You have goals
and you are not...

972
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:46,642
able to take them seriously.

973
01:00:46,644 --> 01:00:48,076
And even the way that your
shoulders are.

974
01:00:48,078 --> 01:00:49,678
Like, look at the way
you're walking.

975
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,713
Do you feel your shoulders?
They're like to the ground.

976
01:00:51,715 --> 01:00:54,082
Your nose is to the ground,
you're not even on your own team.

977
01:00:54,084 --> 01:00:56,184
Of course, I-- I understand
that.

978
01:00:56,186 --> 01:00:59,087
Like, yes, I see that.
I don't like how I...

979
01:00:59,089 --> 01:01:01,423
Don't tell me how to walk, okay?

980
01:01:01,425 --> 01:01:05,227
'Cause I know how I walk,
and I don't like it, alright?

981
01:01:05,229 --> 01:01:08,296
This is not stuff that is,
like, new to me, okay?

982
01:01:08,298 --> 01:01:10,298
I wanna walk
with my shoulders back.

983
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:12,367
That's why I came
to the Olympics.

984
01:01:12,369 --> 01:01:15,771
That's why I have been, like,
running around with you.

985
01:01:15,773 --> 01:01:18,106
That's why I just snuck
into an Olympic stadium,

986
01:01:18,108 --> 01:01:20,609
because, I wanna take more
risks.

987
01:01:20,611 --> 01:01:25,514
And I wanna go home
and-- and start my own practice

988
01:01:25,516 --> 01:01:28,950
and-- and follow through
on the stuff that I dream about.

989
01:01:28,952 --> 01:01:30,952
And you inspire me to do that.

990
01:01:30,954 --> 01:01:34,356
And that's,
that's what I wanna do.

991
01:01:34,358 --> 01:01:37,559
I-- I wanna change things.

992
01:01:37,561 --> 01:01:42,164
- That's awesome.
- So, yeah, thank you!

993
01:01:42,166 --> 01:01:43,598
- You're welcome.
- Great!

994
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:46,435
- That's amazing.
- Yeah, it is amazing!

995
01:01:46,437 --> 01:01:50,238
- So, we agree.
- We agree in an empty Olympic stadium!

996
01:01:51,608 --> 01:01:53,842
We're on the same page!

997
01:01:53,844 --> 01:01:57,913
So, like, let's enjoy our time
together, okay?

998
01:01:57,915 --> 01:01:59,014
Okay, let's do it.

999
01:01:59,016 --> 01:02:00,148
- Deal?
- Deal.

1000
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:02,684
Okay, can we, can we go?

1001
01:02:02,686 --> 01:02:04,953
Why, are you so scared of
getting caught, 'cause I'm not.

1002
01:02:04,955 --> 01:02:06,722
- You're not fearful anymore.
- Let's get outta here.

1003
01:02:06,724 --> 01:02:09,091
I'm not afraid, I am Ezra.
I am--

1004
01:02:09,093 --> 01:02:11,760
- Look at this, like that.
- There you go! - Like that.

1005
01:02:11,762 --> 01:02:15,731
Have you ever seen
one of the athlete dorms?

1006
01:02:15,733 --> 01:02:18,800
- No, I haven't gone into any.
- They're very cool.

1007
01:02:18,802 --> 01:02:20,402
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1008
01:02:20,404 --> 01:02:23,972
- Are you inviting me in?
- Yes, I am.

1009
01:02:23,974 --> 01:02:26,575
- Okay. Alright.
- Okay.

1010
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:40,055
Oh, uh... Sorry.

1011
01:02:40,057 --> 01:02:41,556
It's okay.

1012
01:02:41,558 --> 01:02:45,127
- I was--
- That is my secret.

1013
01:02:45,129 --> 01:02:48,964
- GREs, huh?
- Just in case.

1014
01:02:48,966 --> 01:02:53,368
- I don't know.
- Is this 'cause you're, like, what am I gonna do?

1015
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:55,737
Yeah,
this is, like, just in case

1016
01:02:55,739 --> 01:03:00,776
I... am not qualified for a job,
which I'm not.

1017
01:03:00,778 --> 01:03:05,380
I will take a test, which will
allow me to apply for school,

1018
01:03:05,382 --> 01:03:08,250
which will qualify me
for a job, that is not--

1019
01:03:08,252 --> 01:03:13,321
So somebody's playing it a little safe, huh?
- Being--

1020
01:03:16,827 --> 01:03:19,094
Or somethin', no. You're keeping,
you're keeping your options open.

1021
01:03:19,096 --> 01:03:21,563
- Yeah, I'm just like, I don't know.
- I got it.

1022
01:03:21,565 --> 01:03:23,565
I didn't think you were gonna
find this, that's all.

1023
01:03:23,567 --> 01:03:26,134
- So, I'm gonna put it back under my bed.
- I hear you.

1024
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:31,206
Did you think I would find
this little guy? Who's this?

1025
01:03:31,208 --> 01:03:35,911
It's like new to the family
and somebody delivered him.

1026
01:03:35,913 --> 01:03:38,980
Oh! Someone gave you this?
Someone thoughtfully gave you this?

1027
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:43,919
Somebody, I was crying a little bit until somebody handed that to me.

1028
01:03:43,921 --> 01:03:47,422
- Can I ask you something?
- Yes, anything.

1029
01:03:47,424 --> 01:03:49,858
Will you take me skiing
tomorrow?

1030
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:52,294
- Yes. Have you skied before?
- <i>No.</i>

1031
01:03:52,296 --> 01:03:54,529
Okay, that's... Yes.

1032
01:03:56,233 --> 01:03:59,935
However, I'm leaving tomorrow
so we'll have to go early.

1033
01:03:59,937 --> 01:04:01,703
- <i>Great.</i>
- Okay.

1034
01:04:01,705 --> 01:04:04,706
I'm just,
I'm just laughing at...

1035
01:04:04,708 --> 01:04:05,974
Um...

1036
01:04:09,213 --> 01:04:10,612
What?

1037
01:04:11,515 --> 01:04:14,015
It's just sort of, um...

1038
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:16,751
Like, I don't even know if I'm
gonna tell my friends about you,

1039
01:04:16,753 --> 01:04:19,187
because, I don't really know
like what--

1040
01:04:19,189 --> 01:04:20,422
What is that? I don't know.

1041
01:04:20,424 --> 01:04:21,523
What are you gonna say?

1042
01:04:21,525 --> 01:04:23,692
I don't know, um, just like...

1043
01:04:26,897 --> 01:04:28,496
What?

1044
01:04:28,498 --> 01:04:31,566
You think I'm like
I'm gonna remember this.

1045
01:04:31,568 --> 01:04:33,268
Uh-huh.

1046
01:04:33,270 --> 01:04:34,970
- <i>Well, I am.</i>
- Yeah.

1047
01:04:34,972 --> 01:04:37,038
I figured. I will.

1048
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:40,275
- I am, I'm gonna remember it.
- So will I.

1049
01:04:40,277 --> 01:04:42,110
Yeah.

1050
01:04:42,112 --> 01:04:44,512
<i>You tired?</i>
<i>Don't be tired.</i>

1051
01:04:46,717 --> 01:04:48,884
Okay.

1052
01:04:48,886 --> 01:04:50,919
<i>Don't! Why?</i>

1053
01:04:50,921 --> 01:04:53,655
- 'Cause... Yeah.
- It's my last night!

1054
01:04:53,657 --> 01:04:56,391
So you should just stay.
You should just--

1055
01:04:56,393 --> 01:04:57,926
- Okay.
- You don't have to lay here.

1056
01:04:57,928 --> 01:04:59,761
Just -- just lay. Just stay.

1057
01:04:59,763 --> 01:05:02,597
I'm not gonna do anything
to you.

1058
01:05:02,599 --> 01:05:06,601
I will even put these on while
you lay down. Then you won't--

1059
01:05:06,603 --> 01:05:08,737
- Just stay.
- Okay.

1060
01:05:09,973 --> 01:05:11,873
Oh, you wanna stay? Okay.

1061
01:05:11,875 --> 01:05:13,341
Then stay.

1062
01:05:14,778 --> 01:05:16,578
Okay.

1063
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:18,580
I will put them in between us

1064
01:05:18,582 --> 01:05:20,582
so that nothing happens.

1065
01:05:20,584 --> 01:05:22,984
'Cause I know that,
like, makes you very nervous.

1066
01:05:22,986 --> 01:05:24,953
No, stop talking about that.

1067
01:05:24,955 --> 01:05:27,555
I know that you're--

1068
01:05:27,557 --> 01:05:29,124
Sorry, it's just like,

1069
01:05:29,126 --> 01:05:32,827
I think I, I think it's fine
to make a joke of it.

1070
01:05:32,829 --> 01:05:34,396
It's stupid.

1071
01:05:37,434 --> 01:05:39,634
- I can't really --
- Sleep?

1072
01:05:39,636 --> 01:05:41,903
I can't sleep.
I can't be still.

1073
01:05:41,905 --> 01:05:43,705
Well, how about, do you wanna
just sit here and talk?

1074
01:05:43,707 --> 01:05:46,708
- How about that?
- Okay, for a little bit.

1075
01:05:52,783 --> 01:05:54,816
- Give me your hand.
- Okay.

1076
01:05:56,153 --> 01:05:58,153
Your hands are very warm.

1077
01:05:58,155 --> 01:05:59,721
I am a very warm-blooded person.

1078
01:05:59,723 --> 01:06:01,957
I think I'm cold.
So this is good.

1079
01:06:01,959 --> 01:06:04,292
- No, your hands are warm.
- Really?

1080
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:09,397
That's,
means this is very rare time.

1081
01:06:13,837 --> 01:06:16,604
- Oh, no.
- What's happening?

1082
01:06:16,606 --> 01:06:18,006
- Is someone--
- Oh, my God.

1083
01:06:18,008 --> 01:06:20,108
Is someone challenging me
to a thumb war?

1084
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:23,945
- Someone is challenging you to a thumb war.
- One, two, three, four.

1085
01:06:23,947 --> 01:06:25,981
- Now I declare a thumb war.
- A thumb war.

1086
01:06:27,951 --> 01:06:31,820
This is like..
You're using your bicep!

1087
01:06:31,822 --> 01:06:34,456
That's not fair!
I'll do that, too.

1088
01:06:34,458 --> 01:06:37,993
No, you can't use your--
It's thumb war.

1089
01:06:37,995 --> 01:06:39,861
- Okay.
- Okay?

1090
01:06:39,863 --> 01:06:41,863
I'm sleeping. I don't know
what you're talking about.

1091
01:06:41,865 --> 01:06:45,367
That's cheating.
Arm down, thumb only.

1092
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:49,938
You have such,
like, adult hands.

1093
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:52,941
Like they've seen,
they've done so many things.

1094
01:06:52,943 --> 01:06:55,276
They have been in
so many mouths.

1095
01:06:55,278 --> 01:06:58,079
That's true.
That's so weird.

1096
01:06:58,081 --> 01:07:01,649
It's like,
have you touched more mouths than you've kissed people?

1097
01:07:01,651 --> 01:07:04,352
- And don't even answer that.
- That's for sure.

1098
01:07:04,354 --> 01:07:06,955
- Is that you?
- Mm-hmm.

1099
01:07:09,926 --> 01:07:13,428
<i>Little skier?</i>
<i>You look so cute.</i>

1100
01:07:14,031 --> 01:07:15,797
Aww..

1101
01:07:15,799 --> 01:07:17,165
Girl Scouts.

1102
01:07:17,167 --> 01:07:19,234
Talk about a happy little girl.

1103
01:07:19,236 --> 01:07:24,305
Oh, my God!
You're so cute.

1104
01:07:24,307 --> 01:07:25,840
And it's still you.

1105
01:07:25,842 --> 01:07:28,143
That's the,
that's the weirdest thing

1106
01:07:28,145 --> 01:07:31,179
about seeing pictures of people
when they're, like, little.

1107
01:07:31,181 --> 01:07:32,981
It's like, yeah, same person.

1108
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:10,618
I'm gonna become an Olympic
cross-country skier, I think.

1109
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:12,153
Watch, I'll show you right now.

1110
01:08:12,155 --> 01:08:13,688
Okay.

1111
01:08:14,658 --> 01:08:16,458
You're a star.

1112
01:08:19,663 --> 01:08:24,232
- Hey, you're like... Yeah.
- I did it.

1113
01:08:24,234 --> 01:08:28,069
I fell on an Olympic
cross-country course.

1114
01:08:29,106 --> 01:08:31,439
Oh. I feel good though.

1115
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:33,408
- It feels good to fall?
- Yeah, oh, it feels good to fall.

1116
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:36,111
My dad took me
for the first time.

1117
01:08:36,113 --> 01:08:39,247
And I thought
I was gonna hate it.

1118
01:08:39,249 --> 01:08:41,649
- And then you didn't.
- I didn't hate it.

1119
01:08:43,286 --> 01:08:46,321
This place is like my place.

1120
01:08:46,323 --> 01:08:49,657
The cold, but fresh...

1121
01:08:49,659 --> 01:08:52,760
<i>Like, that's my smell.</i>
<i>I'm not done.</i>

1122
01:08:52,762 --> 01:08:54,095
<i>You're not done?</i>

1123
01:08:55,232 --> 01:08:56,798
I'm not done yet.

1124
01:08:59,603 --> 01:09:03,671
I'm just really happy
right here.

1125
01:09:05,609 --> 01:09:08,643
I don't wanna be anywhere else.
And is that okay?

1126
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:13,848
It's great.
It's the dream.

1127
01:09:15,152 --> 01:09:16,918
You've found something
that you like doing,

1128
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:19,587
and you wanna keep doing it.

1129
01:09:22,859 --> 01:09:24,626
What more could you ask for?

1130
01:09:30,033 --> 01:09:31,933
Okay, let's...

1131
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:35,236
Do you wanna go ski?

1132
01:09:35,238 --> 01:09:36,604
Alright, I should warn you.

1133
01:09:36,606 --> 01:09:38,606
I'm probably gonna
kick your ass, so...

1134
01:10:32,762 --> 01:10:35,597
Ezra, I'm leaving.

1135
01:10:38,969 --> 01:10:41,002
Oh. Ah...

1136
01:10:41,004 --> 01:10:44,572
Well, thank-- thank you
for coming by.

1137
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:46,641
- Yeah.
- Um..

1138
01:10:46,643 --> 01:10:49,143
How are you go--
How are, how are...

1139
01:10:49,145 --> 01:10:50,778
Do you fly to Seoul?

1140
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:53,748
Yeah, we take a train there
and then...

1141
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:54,983
just straight shot...

1142
01:10:54,985 --> 01:10:56,117
Yeah.

1143
01:10:56,119 --> 01:10:57,151
...from there.

1144
01:10:57,153 --> 01:10:58,886
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1145
01:11:01,291 --> 01:11:03,791
Ah, okay. Well...

1146
01:11:03,793 --> 01:11:07,061
I know I didn't have
a pin for you, but, of my own.

1147
01:11:07,063 --> 01:11:09,864
But I, um...

1148
01:11:09,866 --> 01:11:12,033
I thought you would
like this one.

1149
01:11:12,035 --> 01:11:15,069
- Whoa, a snowboarding pin!
- Mm-hmm.

1150
01:11:15,071 --> 01:11:16,971
Oh, that's awesome. Thank you.

1151
01:11:16,973 --> 01:11:20,642
I'd, I never wanted to, like,
ask the athletes for 'em

1152
01:11:20,644 --> 01:11:21,676
'cause I felt
like they were for--

1153
01:11:21,678 --> 01:11:22,710
They're so cool.

1154
01:11:22,712 --> 01:11:24,445
Well, they're athletes.

1155
01:11:24,447 --> 01:11:26,047
Thank you.
Come in.

1156
01:11:26,650 --> 01:11:28,082
Hi.

1157
01:11:30,553 --> 01:11:32,654
Thank you.
No problem, no problem.

1158
01:11:33,657 --> 01:11:36,758
Um, yeah, they've gotta..

1159
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:39,160
Can you check my teeth?

1160
01:11:39,162 --> 01:11:41,796
Well, I checked your teeth,
they're fine. They're, you're...

1161
01:11:41,798 --> 01:11:44,232
I know, just in case.

1162
01:11:47,771 --> 01:11:52,674
Yeah, okay.
Um, please have a seat.

1163
01:12:02,218 --> 01:12:05,086
You've got your, uh,
snow globe ring again?

1164
01:12:09,893 --> 01:12:11,826
You've got a really nice teeth.

1165
01:12:13,229 --> 01:12:17,632
Do you know how I can keep them
this way forever?

1166
01:12:17,634 --> 01:12:21,002
You could see a,
a dentist regularly.

1167
01:12:33,583 --> 01:12:38,086
Um, can you do the thing

1168
01:12:38,088 --> 01:12:40,722
<i>where you check my jaw?</i>

1169
01:12:40,724 --> 01:12:42,857

01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:55,236
<i>And close it.</i>

1173

And I'm just gonna check
your thyroid

1177
01:13:10,687 --> 01:13:12,987
your lymph nodes to make sure...

1178

everything's okay.

1179
01:13:16,726 --> 01:13:18,493
Is everything okay?

1180
01:13:20,163 --> 01:13:21,562
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:13:21,564 --> 01:13:23,064
Are you sure?

It's the best thyroids
I've ever seen.

1183

<i>Thank you.</i>

1184
01:13:27,771 --> 01:13:29,871
You've got a good heartbeat.

1185
01:13:32,375 --> 01:13:33,975
I hope so.

1186
01:13:38,515 --> 01:13:40,882

- Um...

1192
01:14:00,403 --> 01:14:03,805
Actually, I think you're gonna
miss your bus.

01:14:03,807 --> 01:14:05,973
I'm not gonna miss my bus.

1194

Yeah, I have...
