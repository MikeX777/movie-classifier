Where are my glasses?
Where are they?

13
00:02:46,172 --> 00:02:48,266
Get Salama to come look for
my glasses quickly

14
00:02:52,602 --> 00:02:55,572
I brought you a wonderful
collection Mr. Khalil

15
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:00,364
The factory wants to produce
unequaled stuff this time

16
00:03:03,898 --> 00:03:07,027
I even want to take advantage of
prince of Bloudestan's visit

to promote our factory's goods
in his country

00:03:21,137 --> 00:03:22,468
...96

21
00:03:23,292 --> 00:03:25,727
Slow down! That's no floor
you're wiping

22
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,222
- I like to work perfectly
- No, don't

23
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,403
Here! Missed by 200 numbers

24
00:03:33,893 --> 00:03:38,160
- Take one
- I'm broke, there you go

25
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:44,038
Good Lord! 5 'ladies'!

26
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,475
Just one is driving me crazy

27
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,621
- Looking good
- No, take these

28
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:59,986
We're so late, what's the
time now?

29
00:04:00,517 --> 00:04:02,349
- Now it's...
- Nobody asked you

30
00:04:04,062 --> 00:04:08,260
- What's the time please?
- The watch broke down

31
00:04:13,551 --> 00:04:14,518
How rude!

32
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:19,410
- We need the customs stamp
- It's over there. Hello

33
00:04:24,082 --> 00:04:26,949
I can see you're busy, sir.
I'll come back tomorrow

34
00:04:32,423 --> 00:04:33,686
Hello.. what? How much is
a pound?!

35
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:38,309
Here we sell by meters.
Whom do you want?

36
00:04:39,688 --> 00:04:41,713
The meat restaurant?
No, it's a wrong number

37
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:47,052
- The cupboard is locked
- Locked? The key.. Get Salama!

38
00:04:51,818 --> 00:04:52,649
Where is Salama?

39
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,441
The manager is
asking for you

40
00:05:01,237 --> 00:05:03,831
Chocolate

41
00:05:07,111 --> 00:05:09,739
Why are you crying, dear?
Do you want chocolate?

42
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,456
You want a candy? Take it

43
00:05:13,055 --> 00:05:15,456
I told you not to take dirty
things from anyone

44
00:05:18,094 --> 00:05:19,061
Salama...

45
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:34,191
- Hello.. Welcome..
- Thanks sir.. what for?

46
00:05:35,056 --> 00:05:38,890
I told you many times not to
move from here

47
00:05:39,609 --> 00:05:45,571
You are an office man, that's
your job here. Understood?

48
00:05:47,116 --> 00:05:50,552
Yes sir, an office man..
I didn't say I was a partner

49
00:05:53,894 --> 00:05:57,159
Where are my glasses?
Where did you take them?

50
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,975
They're right here, sir.
Where would they go?

51
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,896
My glasses!

52
00:06:06,928 --> 00:06:08,919
Don't be angry, sir. I didn't
sell them

53
00:06:15,687 --> 00:06:19,089
Go get the customs stamp,
tardy oaf

54
00:06:21,421 --> 00:06:24,391
What are you rambling about?

55
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:27,978
I'm saying please be patient

56
00:06:44,465 --> 00:06:47,560
- I need half day off, sir
- Why is that?

57
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:55,011
- My aunt is dead
- 2 days ago somebody died

58
00:06:55,692 --> 00:06:57,524
Yes, it was my cousin, sir

59
00:06:57,847 --> 00:07:01,750
You took half day off last Friday
because someone died

60
00:07:02,261 --> 00:07:04,491
She was my cousin's daughter

61
00:07:05,146 --> 00:07:08,878
How many aunts and cousins
do you have?

62
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:13,104
Big family.. they die after
one another.. what do I do?

63
00:07:13,592 --> 00:07:17,153
No more days off except when
you're dead. Got that?

64
00:07:17,763 --> 00:07:20,994
Got it, sir, but what holiday
will this be?

65
00:07:22,281 --> 00:07:25,012
Beat it! Go cash these cheques

66
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,737
Patience is driving me crazy
Mr. Rihan

67
00:07:34,272 --> 00:07:37,264
I worked in this store
for 25 years

68
00:07:37,921 --> 00:07:42,825
Since it was built. We started it:
me, the owner and the builders

69
00:07:43,553 --> 00:07:45,248
Now he tells me I'm just
an office man

70
00:07:46,263 --> 00:07:50,996
What should he tell you? Mr. manager?
You are an office man

71
00:07:51,442 --> 00:07:53,809
An office man for 25 years,
Mr. Rihan?

72
00:07:55,127 --> 00:07:58,097
The soldier who serves 25 years
in the army

73
00:07:58,533 --> 00:08:00,467
is promoted to be a general
not just a sergeant

74
00:08:00,896 --> 00:08:01,954
You are stubborn!

75
00:08:06,075 --> 00:08:08,339
El Bashawat Alley

76
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,453
Charity please

77
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,279
Are you always begging? Shall I
call a doctor for your hand?

78
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:21,965
My wife is in labour, son

79
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:26,142
She's been in labour for 19 years

80
00:08:27,103 --> 00:08:29,629
What kind of baby is that?
He'll be born with a moustache

81
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:32,671
Shame on you. Finish this story

82
00:08:35,896 --> 00:08:41,198
Thank you.. but it's a bit erased

83
00:08:49,626 --> 00:08:53,324
<i>What's wrong, Um Yam“?
Watch it son!</i>

84
00:08:55,604 --> 00:08:59,165
That stupid boy put ink
in his sister's eye

85
00:08:59,844 --> 00:09:02,609
Shame on you boy. You put ink
in your sister's eye?

86
00:09:03,181 --> 00:09:05,878
She put chili in my ears

87
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:07,297
Shut up!

88
00:09:12,357 --> 00:09:14,917
<i>How are you Um Yanni?
How is Mr. Kostin?</i>

89
00:09:15,311 --> 00:09:18,246
Fine, thanks. How are you Mr. Salama?
How is your family?

90
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,648
They're fine, Um Yanni

91
00:09:25,877 --> 00:09:26,901
Who is it?

92
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:38,104
- Hello Sattouta
- Poor thing carrying all that!

93
00:09:43,603 --> 00:09:48,200
Hello, mother in law.. Wow.. soup

94
00:09:49,303 --> 00:09:50,896
My guts are freezing

95
00:09:52,848 --> 00:09:57,809
Where are the spoons?
What's that? A jug?

96
00:09:59,313 --> 00:10:00,872
Did you cook the soup
in a barrel?

97
00:10:01,294 --> 00:10:03,854
Our neighbour Um Ayousha
borrowed them

98
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:06,079
Doesn't she have anything?
She borrows a seive,

99
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:12,350
a knife and a broom. Why doesn't
she borrow your mother?

100
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:15,427
Shame on you

101
00:10:28,057 --> 00:10:30,458
What's happening up there?

102
00:10:31,393 --> 00:10:32,360
What is it?

103
00:10:32,888 --> 00:10:34,287
Stop hammering

104
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:37,526
I said I'm sorry. If you don't
like it, go to hell

105
00:10:38,728 --> 00:10:40,856
I'll show you, I'll ruin your day

106
00:10:42,585 --> 00:10:44,314
Calm down, Salama

107
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:48,330
Hey you messy, foolish man!

108
00:10:50,266 --> 00:10:54,203
Shut up you insolent, ill-bred,

109
00:10:55,341 --> 00:10:58,436
good-for-nothing office man

110
00:11:00,311 --> 00:11:05,374
You garbage can.. teaching scumbag

111
00:11:06,151 --> 00:11:07,846
If you're man enough, come up here

112
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,102
If you only come down here

113
00:11:10,391 --> 00:11:13,918
- I'll break your neck
- I'll pull your teeth out

114
00:11:16,682 --> 00:11:20,812
Coward! Let me go!

115
00:11:24,398 --> 00:11:25,524
Hey you people.. everyday a fight?

116
00:11:25,754 --> 00:11:29,315
I'll kill you both. I want to
have some sleep

117
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:33,674
If only this man didn't want
to sleep.. Sleep Mr. Kostin

118
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,825
You're lucky.. you slipped
away you idiot

119
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:43,355
If I throw stones at barking dogs,
stones will have a price

120
00:11:52,552 --> 00:11:55,487
Hello, Helen.. how is my wife?

121
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:04,421
The doctor says it'll be
today? 0 Lord

122
00:12:08,296 --> 00:12:14,497
Keep in touch. Go away now,
I can't think

123
00:12:16,672 --> 00:12:19,869
We have to finish our issue.
I'm leaving after tomorrow

124
00:12:20,217 --> 00:12:23,619
Do me a favour Mr. Albert,
delay this issue for a while

125
00:12:23,971 --> 00:12:26,906
I can't get hold of myself today

126
00:12:30,506 --> 00:12:35,171
Why? You're changed since that
phone call from Alexandria

127
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:39,524
For 20 years my wife
couldn't get children

128
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:42,188
Today she's in labour

129
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:47,457
Imagine? For 20 years
I couldn't get children

130
00:12:48,858 --> 00:12:50,849
I mean my wife couldn't
get children

131
00:12:51,152 --> 00:12:53,621
OK, I understand" Congratulations

132
00:12:55,218 --> 00:12:58,711
- Mr. Armanios
- Don't make me lose count

133
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:05,162
46+5 equals 51 pounds..

134
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,100
What do you want?

135
00:13:07,973 --> 00:13:11,307
The manager wants the power bill

136
00:13:12,735 --> 00:13:16,603
Last month is November

137
00:13:16,976 --> 00:13:21,209
Go November, come November,

138
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,202
there is November

139
00:13:25,526 --> 00:13:27,927
Power bill.. Power bill

140
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:34,969
71 pounds and 622 millieme

141
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:38,162
What else Salama?

142
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:43,394
Nothing. Give this to the manager

143
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,397
This is the week's revenue,
take it to the bank

144
00:13:54,061 --> 00:13:55,495
There is 4000 pounds

145
00:13:58,232 --> 00:14:02,032
and 118 pounds, equals

146
00:14:03,377 --> 00:14:05,004
4118

147
00:14:06,991 --> 00:14:09,050
Take care, Salama

148
00:14:10,676 --> 00:14:11,643
God help me

149
00:14:33,858 --> 00:14:36,088
- Are you blind?
- You look drunk

150
00:14:36,395 --> 00:14:37,362
Stop it, it's your fault

151
00:14:41,643 --> 00:14:44,704
Is this you, stupid teacher?
I'll ruin your day

152
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,000
Is it you, bloody office man?
Crush him, driver

153
00:14:49,777 --> 00:14:53,042
Crush me?! I'll crush your whole
family. Hey sergeant!

154
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:55,189
Stop it people, I'll take you
to the police station

155
00:14:55,546 --> 00:14:58,140
Yes, to the police station.
I'll testify with you

156
00:14:58,848 --> 00:15:02,375
He was blocking the street.
You are a liar

157
00:15:02,741 --> 00:15:04,539
You have no conscience

158
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,646
Shut up please. What's your name?

159
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:10,099
Mr. Bayoumi Morgan

160
00:15:10,388 --> 00:15:12,948
- Without Mr.
- Yes, without Mr.

161
00:15:13,272 --> 00:15:14,899

164
00:15:21,406 --> 00:15:22,032
OK

165
00:15:27,975 --> 00:15:28,703
You can go now

166
00:15:30,686 --> 00:15:32,745
Tomorrow I'll watch you in jail

167
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,178

168
00:16:02,906 --> 00:16:04,567

Today in honor of this great day,
we'll close this evening

172
00:16:19,485 --> 00:16:22,147
All the employees have
half day off

173
00:16:37,211 --> 00:16:40,875
Great. There's no way out now

174
00:16:44,266 --> 00:16:46,564
It's not the time for labour,
Mrs. Khalil

175
00:16:49,132 --> 00:16:51,794
Damn you, Bayoumi

176
00:16:54,693 --> 00:16:55,888
What shall I do in this trouble?

177
00:17:08,144 --> 00:17:11,478
Don't say.. really? Where?

178
00:17:12,628 --> 00:17:15,325
Abd El Latif? What will you eat?

179
00:17:16,694 --> 00:17:20,597
16 dishes” Cool.. what are they?

180
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:24,363
- Please, sir, I'm in a hurry
- Wait till I finish

181
00:17:25,348 --> 00:17:29,785
- Strange
- Calf's legs? Delicious!

182
00:17:30,528 --> 00:17:33,691
I love it..

183
00:17:35,915 --> 00:17:40,682
And molokhia?
With chicken or rabbits? Wow!

184
00:17:41,267 --> 00:17:42,462
Your turn, Mr. Salama

185
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:45,050
Please, sir

186
00:17:48,045 --> 00:17:50,946
What? Vine leaves and beans?
Fresh or dried?

187
00:17:52,807 --> 00:17:54,502
I'm sure coming tomorrow

188
00:17:54,754 --> 00:17:55,880
It's tomorrow already

189
00:17:57,082 --> 00:17:59,312
Wow! And cream soup too?

190
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,647
Come on, man, it's still a
long way to go

191
00:18:05,597 --> 00:18:10,535
What about salads? Tehina
and pickles? Very good

192
00:18:14,947 --> 00:18:18,474
I was coming, but something
bad delayed me

193
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,936
My wallet was stolen
and I didn't feel it

194
00:18:26,521 --> 00:18:30,924
No, I'm not an idiot, but thieves
here are very clever

195
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:34,039
You scared me to death

196
00:18:36,253 --> 00:18:39,587
OK, I'm coming. Goodbye, Zuzu

197
00:18:55,543 --> 00:19:00,140
Is this Mr Khalil Hindawy's house?
It's me Salama

198
00:19:02,112 --> 00:19:06,709
Please, get him for me.
What? He travelled?

199
00:19:15,389 --> 00:19:17,414
Perfect! Now there's no way out

200
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,493
Your beard Mr. Salama

201
00:19:26,616 --> 00:19:27,481
My wallet..

202
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:36,334
- My wallet, you theives
- What's wrong, sir?

203
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:39,705
I hang my jacket on the peg
and my wallet gets stolen?

204
00:19:40,032 --> 00:19:41,124
I'll sue you

205
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,356
It's not right to say so.
Look for it again

206
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:47,482
Look for it? Am I lying?
Here are all my pockets

207
00:22:17,238 --> 00:22:19,502
Salama! What's the matter?

208
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,282
Nothing. Am I hurt?
Are my clothes torn?

209
00:22:24,433 --> 00:22:29,098
I'm alright. Bring me
something to eat

210
00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:34,967
Don't we know you? You're changed.
What were you holding?

211
00:22:35,555 --> 00:22:36,989
- A briefcase
- A briefcase?

212
00:22:37,362 --> 00:22:39,262
Yes, a briefcase. You've never
seen one before?

213
00:22:41,463 --> 00:22:43,124
It contains the manager's
clothes.

214
00:22:45,842 --> 00:22:49,574
Where is the food?
Didn't you cook today?

215
00:22:49,944 --> 00:22:53,039
- Cook in what?
- Nice joke

216
00:22:53,385 --> 00:22:56,082
- There is a disaster
- Disaster?

217
00:22:56,443 --> 00:22:59,936
We went out and when we came
we found the door broken

218
00:23:00,302 --> 00:23:02,896
- The door is broken?
- All the copperware is stolen

219
00:23:17,923 --> 00:23:19,982
- What are you looking for?
- Nothing

220
00:23:20,252 --> 00:23:23,813
- What are you hiding here?
- The manager's clothes

221
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:33,973
Where are you going?
Wait till you eat

222
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:44,324
- Dirty staircase
- Insolent stairwell

223
00:23:56,295 --> 00:23:57,387
Hello Mr. Salama

224
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,209
No hellos, where are you
Mr. Rihan?

225
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:04,272
Come tell me what to do

226
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:10,646
What happened?

227
00:24:11,484 --> 00:24:15,478
I went to the bank and
found it closed

228
00:24:16,176 --> 00:24:19,874
Will just one minute make a big
difference? Couldn't wait?

229
00:24:20,903 --> 00:24:22,064
Where shall I put these now?

230
00:24:22,293 --> 00:24:23,954
- Money?
- Lower your voice!

231
00:24:32,234 --> 00:24:34,396
I go home to find the
copperware stolen

232
00:24:35,292 --> 00:24:40,662
and the manager has travelled.
The street is full of bikes

233
00:24:41,132 --> 00:24:44,261
- Listen, there's only one way
- Say it quickly

234
00:25:04,522 --> 00:25:07,685
The Science of Palm Reading

235
00:25:10,606 --> 00:25:14,406
The right hand, idiocy line

236
00:25:17,973 --> 00:25:21,534
There is a VIP guest coming.
His Highness prince Kandahar

237
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:24,360
Prince Kandahar?

238
00:25:26,211 --> 00:25:32,412
I heard this name when I was
a consul in Persia

239
00:25:32,885 --> 00:25:38,187
Yes, his state in Bloudestan is
close to Persia

240
00:25:38,793 --> 00:25:41,524
He's one of the richest
princes in the east

241
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:46,398
Huge fortune. He owns
an emerald

242
00:25:46,857 --> 00:25:50,259
as big as an orange

243
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:53,100
What kind of orange, dad?

244
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:03,759
Will he stay in Egypt for long?

245
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:08,507
I don't know, my lady.
It's an unofficial visit

246
00:26:08,892 --> 00:26:10,917
He recommended it remains
in secrecy

247
00:26:13,168 --> 00:26:15,728
Too bad Your Excellency
will not attend it

248
00:26:16,053 --> 00:26:20,286
- Well, I...
- We can delay our trip a week

249
00:26:21,022 --> 00:26:26,927
But I'm not ready with
protocol clothes

250
00:26:27,835 --> 00:26:30,634
Don't worry. I'll handle
this issue

251
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:39,219
Nahed. You have to come
to Cairo right away

252
00:26:39,653 --> 00:26:43,487
- I'll be there tomorrow
- Not tomorrow, right now

253
00:26:43,858 --> 00:26:45,553
Get the ermine coat with you

254
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:51,937
Don't forget anything,
my jewelry and dad's tuxedo

255
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,713
- And Fayek's too
- Wait

256
00:26:56,023 --> 00:26:59,721
- I want to tell her something
- Ok.. here

257
00:27:07,111 --> 00:27:11,708
It's <i>me..</i> how are you Nahed?

258
00:27:12,393 --> 00:27:13,519
Fine, thanks Mr. Fayek

259
00:27:23,098 --> 00:27:25,965
- The cylinder is broken
- That means we can't move?

260
00:27:26,505 --> 00:27:27,495
I have to replace it

261
00:27:55,562 --> 00:27:58,588
I hope Your Highness is pleased
with this trip

262
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:04,172
Sure Mr. Gawdat, seeing Egypt
after all that time..

263
00:28:05,259 --> 00:28:08,422
Memories of studying days

264
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,470
and the lovely tarbush that
I missed

265
00:28:13,531 --> 00:28:17,991
I hope that depression and
boredom Your Highness felt

266
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:23,699
are gone now, especially after the
welcome from people on board

267
00:28:24,132 --> 00:28:26,294
and the admiration
Your Highness noticed

268
00:28:28,511 --> 00:28:31,606
Your Highness were the center
of all attention

269
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:37,031
Especially ladies who were competing
to get your attention

270
00:28:37,861 --> 00:28:43,857
Because I'm a prince. Looks
have influence on ladies

271
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:50,031
If I had been a normal person,
no one would have cared for me

272
00:29:13,105 --> 00:29:15,437
We can't help him.
It needs a lot of repair

273
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:44,313
- Come with us if you don't mind
- Thanks

274
00:29:45,151 --> 00:29:47,586
We're going to Cairo and
we have enough room

275
00:29:50,885 --> 00:29:53,820
- I'd rather wait
- Of course you're free

276
00:29:55,126 --> 00:30:01,498
but this is a desert and
you may not find help

277
00:30:02,251 --> 00:30:04,948
You'd better go with them
to send me help

278
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,332
I don't want to cause you trouble

279
00:30:09,793 --> 00:30:10,487
On the contrary

280
00:30:18,726 --> 00:30:21,718
It's a shame the car breaks
down in such a road

281
00:30:23,313 --> 00:30:26,180
Yes, especially for a lady alone

282
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:34,918
- Shall I open the window?
- No, it'll let sand in, thanks

283
00:30:48,964 --> 00:30:50,261
The weather is nice today

284
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:55,426
Yes, sunny day, cool weather

285
00:31:14,197 --> 00:31:16,063
What is it?

286
00:31:16,769 --> 00:31:18,703
A deer on the road, he asked..

287
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,453
- A deer is called Shikabi?
- Yes, in our language

288
00:31:22,921 --> 00:31:24,889
- Your language?
- We're strangers

289
00:31:25,459 --> 00:31:29,327
- But you speak Arabic well
- Yes, my colleague is Egyptian

290
00:31:29,838 --> 00:31:31,203
I had my education
in Egypt too

291
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:35,083
- Are you Turkish?
- No, we're from Bloudestan

292
00:31:37,311 --> 00:31:40,042
Bloudestan? Where's that?
The north pole?

293
00:31:41,864 --> 00:31:44,799
No, between India and Afghanistan.
It's famous

294
00:31:45,722 --> 00:31:47,281
Are you here for leisure?

295
00:31:47,738 --> 00:31:52,335
Yes.. no, we're from prince
Kandahar's court

296
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:56,513
- Kandahar?
- Funny name, isn't it?

297
00:31:57,262 --> 00:32:00,994
Why is she so late? Maybe
something happened to her

298
00:32:01,641 --> 00:32:05,771
Maybe she came walking.
She is athletic

299
00:32:15,753 --> 00:32:16,982
No, there's nobody

300
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:09,204
Excuse me, sir

301
00:33:09,417 --> 00:33:11,681
- No one called me?
- No my lady

302
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:14,118
Strange, where did she go?

303
00:33:19,983 --> 00:33:20,814
Your handkerchief my lady

304
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:35,487
- Please Mr.
- What do you want?

305
00:33:35,832 --> 00:33:38,858
If somebody wants to use the
deposit box and get a room

306
00:33:43,096 --> 00:33:44,427
Please Mr..

307
00:33:59,988 --> 00:34:01,854
- Excuse me
- What is it?

308
00:34:02,595 --> 00:34:04,563
- What do I do to sleep here?
- Get a room

309
00:34:05,133 --> 00:34:09,730
- How much does it cost?
- 150 pt.. 2 pounds

310
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,911
- Per month?
- Month! Per night

311
00:34:15,698 --> 00:34:18,497
Is there a room on the roof
or beside the stairs..

312
00:34:19,001 --> 00:34:21,971
In the basement, something poor

313
00:34:22,407 --> 00:34:25,536
- Poor? For whom?
- For me

314
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:30,811
For you? You will sleep in it?

315
00:34:31,165 --> 00:34:33,099
Yes. What's so strange
about that?

316
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:38,419
- Go away..
- What? I don't want charity

317
00:34:38,986 --> 00:34:43,150
- You are rude
- No, but be nice, it's a hotel

318
00:34:43,504 --> 00:34:47,270
A client asks. You should
not insult him

319
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,438
What is that noise?
Get out, please

320
00:34:49,726 --> 00:34:51,888
Why get out? I'm not in
your own house

321
00:34:52,645 --> 00:34:54,773
- You are rude. Out
- Don't push me

322
00:35:06,757 --> 00:35:08,748
Is this Nefertiti Palace hotel?

323
00:35:10,892 --> 00:35:12,758
- I think so
- I live here

324
00:35:19,894 --> 00:35:20,622
Please come in

325
00:35:26,881 --> 00:35:28,076
Stupid barbarians

326
00:35:28,932 --> 00:35:31,492
Chaotic hotel. Where's the manager?

327
00:35:31,816 --> 00:35:32,647
Get lost!

328
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,215
Where's the prince?

329
00:35:42,626 --> 00:35:44,094
- The prince is here
- Here?

330
00:35:44,363 --> 00:35:46,457
Yes, outside, dressed in black

331
00:35:47,005 --> 00:35:52,569
The prince? I think he
arrived before us

332
00:35:53,018 --> 00:35:57,615
Great fuss about nothing..
useless employees

333
00:35:58,822 --> 00:36:02,725
If it wasn't for what I have..
Where is the manager?

334
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,795
Welcome Your Highness

335
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:09,461
- This is prince Kandahar?
- Prince who?

336
00:36:11,856 --> 00:36:13,381
Oh yes, prince Kandahar

337
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:16,826
Forgive us if the reception
isn't perfect

338
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:21,408
Reception good for nothing

339
00:36:22,527 --> 00:36:24,188
and this idiot manager..

340
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:27,517
- It's me Your Highness
- Excuse me

341
00:36:28,296 --> 00:36:32,062
It's strange you recognised him.
This is prince Kandahar

342
00:36:33,927 --> 00:36:37,488
0k Mr. manager. A client comes here
and you insult him that way?

343
00:36:38,133 --> 00:36:42,297
When a client comes to us for
1/2 meter, we give him lemonade

344
00:36:43,172 --> 00:36:46,574
And you.. shame on you

345
00:36:46,926 --> 00:36:49,088
Forgive us. We didn't know
your arrival time

346
00:36:49,393 --> 00:36:52,385
I myself didn't know when
I was coming

347
00:36:52,904 --> 00:36:56,169
I don't want any music..
just some respect

348
00:36:56,588 --> 00:36:59,455
as a client entering a hotel
not someone asking for charity

349
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:02,947
Come in, please

350
00:37:15,044 --> 00:37:18,981
What's all that army behind me?
All that for one client?

351
00:37:25,193 --> 00:37:26,991
Strict orders..

352
00:37:30,337 --> 00:37:31,930
This is a temporary prince

353
00:38:04,851 --> 00:38:05,909
The special suite

354
00:38:10,342 --> 00:38:14,643
Is it small this special suite?
I want something cheap

355
00:38:15,069 --> 00:38:17,663
- Don't say that, Your Highness
- One must talk frankly

356
00:38:18,233 --> 00:38:20,634
Don't bite more than you
can chew, right?

357
00:38:20,943 --> 00:38:23,640
Yes, right this way please

358
00:38:35,263 --> 00:38:36,753
This is luxurious!

359
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,806
- Reception hall
- Reception hall?

360
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,745
Where is the sleeping hall?
Strange

361
00:38:46,316 --> 00:38:49,217
I can't afford all that

362
00:38:49,548 --> 00:38:51,516
There's no problem,
please come in

363
00:39:08,456 --> 00:39:09,321
Wow

364
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,107
- What is this?
- The bed

365
00:39:15,546 --> 00:39:16,604
I'm afraid to sleep on it

366
00:39:26,634 --> 00:39:30,036
His Highness likes the system of
your hotel and he thanks you

367
00:39:33,272 --> 00:39:34,467
And who are you?

368
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:37,307
First secretary.. Second secretary

369
00:39:37,895 --> 00:39:40,557
Your suite is that way.
Would you like to see it?

370
00:39:40,885 --> 00:39:42,444
No thanks, don't bother

371
00:39:49,191 --> 00:39:50,158
What now Your Highness?

372
00:39:50,373 --> 00:39:54,901
Let's have some fun. Plus
I have something in mind

373
00:39:57,603 --> 00:40:01,039
How much is this room?
It must be 2 pounds

374
00:40:05,214 --> 00:40:07,308
We didn't discuss money yet

375
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:11,243
- Well, this issue is...
- Just to know, to sleep freely

376
00:40:12,305 --> 00:40:15,502
- How much do you want to pay?
- Frankly speaking"

377
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:22,494
I can afford 20 piastres

378
00:40:23,184 --> 00:40:23,912
You got a deal

379
00:40:25,234 --> 00:40:26,463
- What? With 20 piastres?
- Yes

380
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:28,600
- All that with 20 piastres?
- Yes

381
00:40:29,822 --> 00:40:34,350
How cheap! With a reception,
first bathroom, second bathroom

382
00:40:35,383 --> 00:40:37,977
I'll visit you frequently,
to change scenery

383
00:40:39,902 --> 00:40:41,301
What do you do in this hotel?

384
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:42,989
First secretary

385
00:40:46,054 --> 00:40:50,548
- Second secretary
- I just don't understand it

386
00:40:51,129 --> 00:40:55,032
First and second bathrooms..
first and second secretaries

387
00:40:56,272 --> 00:40:59,435
- System
- System or not, I'll pay 20 pt

388
00:40:59,817 --> 00:41:00,579
OK

389
00:41:01,972 --> 00:41:05,704
Mr. first and second secretaries

390
00:41:06,247 --> 00:41:08,807
Look, I'm not here to sleep
or to shower

391
00:41:09,584 --> 00:41:12,349
but I have something valuable.

392
00:41:12,886 --> 00:41:16,288
I heard you have a safe

393
00:41:17,091 --> 00:41:17,785
Yes we do

394
00:41:18,794 --> 00:41:21,729
And do you both think

395
00:41:26,581 --> 00:41:27,412
it is safe?

396
00:41:27,762 --> 00:41:30,129
- Of course it is
- No offense, just asking

397
00:41:30,925 --> 00:41:33,087
You give a receipt for
what you take?

398
00:41:33,636 --> 00:41:37,539
- Sure
- Great, count these

399
00:41:40,066 --> 00:41:43,297
- The car broke down
- Don't answer back

400
00:41:43,646 --> 00:41:48,743
I was alone in the desert but
the prince's secretary saved me

401
00:41:49,172 --> 00:41:51,573
- Prince who?
- Prince Kandahar

402
00:41:52,127 --> 00:41:53,959
What does Kandahar mean, dad?

403
00:41:55,671 --> 00:41:57,264
He didn't say when the prince
will arrive?

404
00:41:57,966 --> 00:41:59,900
He already arrived,
I just saw him

405
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:03,665
- How does he look like?
- In my point of view-

406
00:42:04,013 --> 00:42:05,845
his secretary is 30 times
much better

407
00:42:06,134 --> 00:42:07,795
I'm better than him.
Right, Nahed?

408
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:15,428
I received from Mr. Salama Abd
El Sabour.. your profession?

409
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:17,869
Employee in Khalil Hindawy's Shop

410
00:42:18,125 --> 00:42:20,457
What kind of employee?
Manager? Clerk?

411
00:42:20,766 --> 00:42:22,700
- No, organiser
- Organiser?

412
00:42:22,956 --> 00:42:26,517
Yes, I organise desks, chairs,
and papers

413
00:42:28,169 --> 00:42:29,898
- A servant?
- No, an office man

414
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:35,558
- Office man?
- The manager's first office man

415
00:42:36,164 --> 00:42:38,861
An office man and you have
4118 pounds?

416
00:42:39,188 --> 00:42:42,783
That's the disaster,
they're my responsibility

417
00:42:43,254 --> 00:42:46,986
Unfortunately, the bank closed
the manager's wife was in labour

418
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:51,020
He went to her in Alexandria,
our copperware was robbed

419
00:43:07,723 --> 00:43:09,282
- What?
- What is it?

420
00:43:10,364 --> 00:43:12,856
Kandahar? Who is that?

421
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:15,184
- His Highness the prince
- His Highness who?

422
00:43:15,543 --> 00:43:21,004
- His Highness the prince
- Who? I want a hotel receipt

423
00:43:21,695 --> 00:43:23,754
A hotel receipt or one from
His Highness?

424
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:26,391
I'm not buying that talk

425
00:43:26,805 --> 00:43:29,638
- Just listen...
- Listen to what, you burglars

426
00:43:39,247 --> 00:43:44,413
If you don't give me my briefcase
now, I'll kill you

427
00:43:45,504 --> 00:43:48,439
- Shame on you
- Shut up thief! My briefcase

428
00:43:48,806 --> 00:43:51,741
You, let him go. Give him his
briefcase

429
00:43:53,011 --> 00:43:53,705
Take it

430
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,360
Your Highness! You wanted
to steal it?

431
00:43:59,859 --> 00:44:05,229
I would let you sleep in a hospital..
Your Highness..

432
00:44:09,278 --> 00:44:10,040
Splendid

433
00:44:11,051 --> 00:44:16,490
I see you don't care; royal bed
and 2 bathrooms.. 20 pt.

434
00:44:17,341 --> 00:44:21,505
Only to steal my briefcase,
but you didn't fool me

435
00:44:21,894 --> 00:44:25,728
- It's over now
- Who is this in your court?

436
00:44:26,378 --> 00:44:30,372
The secretary for trick department?

437
00:44:32,634 --> 00:44:35,433
- Splendid
- Let's forget it Your Highness

438
00:44:36,527 --> 00:44:40,122
- Listen Mr. Salman
- Mr. Salama if you don't mind

439
00:44:40,871 --> 00:44:43,932
What do you think of
a 500 pound reward

440
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:47,048
and living in luxury for
a couple of days?

441
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:50,017
You want me to join your gang
and steal together?

442
00:44:50,708 --> 00:44:54,076
- See these?
- What ? Today's revenue?

443
00:44:54,462 --> 00:44:57,432
Aren't those enough?
Must you steal my briefcase?

444
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:58,893
Look at this currency

445
00:45:03,082 --> 00:45:05,642
You must have robbed
some tourists

446
00:45:05,966 --> 00:45:07,263
Just look well

447
00:45:19,834 --> 00:45:20,596
What's that?

448
00:45:30,261 --> 00:45:32,593
You know who I am now or should
I get you another evidence?

449
00:45:36,309 --> 00:45:38,505
Shame on me!

450
00:45:39,125 --> 00:45:41,287
It's alright Mr. Abd El Salam

451
00:45:41,696 --> 00:45:42,857
Salama Your Highness.. Salama

452
00:45:43,087 --> 00:45:45,784
- Stand up
- I can't, sir

453
00:45:47,848 --> 00:45:49,646
Good grief. I said too much..
my big mouth

454
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:55,756
- Get up Mr. Selim
- Salama, sir. I'm so embarrassed

455
00:45:56,294 --> 00:45:58,194
My manners are never like
that, but...

456
00:45:58,484 --> 00:46:01,385
I have a strange idea Mr. Salama

457
00:46:02,967 --> 00:46:04,765
What sir? To take my briefcase?
Go ahead

458
00:46:06,131 --> 00:46:10,261
No, listen. Would you like to be
a prince for sometime?

459
00:46:13,846 --> 00:46:17,840
I'm an office man, Your Highness,
just an office man

460
00:46:20,729 --> 00:46:22,094
Do you insist on that Your Highness?

461
00:46:22,605 --> 00:46:26,200
I want to prove that money

462
00:46:26,985 --> 00:46:29,579
and appearences are
everything in life

463
00:47:06,052 --> 00:47:07,042
Call the hair stylist

464
00:47:22,561 --> 00:47:26,122
It looks like coincidences
are chasing us, miss

465
00:47:26,628 --> 00:47:29,188
This is the second time we
meet accidentally

466
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:31,954
I'm afraid you don't like
those nice surprises

467
00:47:32,258 --> 00:47:33,726
No sir, on the contrary

468
00:47:34,169 --> 00:47:36,263
I think your family was
worried about you

469
00:47:36,846 --> 00:47:39,281
I envy myself for this chance

470
00:47:39,627 --> 00:47:43,825
And I have a strange wish that
accidents like this repeat

471
00:47:44,214 --> 00:47:46,182
On one condition, that I save you

472
00:47:46,473 --> 00:47:47,770
You are so sweet

473
00:47:53,252 --> 00:47:55,380
- Are you still here?
- I was just going, madam

474
00:47:55,684 --> 00:47:58,710
I won't wait for you till you
finish talking with passers by

475
00:48:09,379 --> 00:48:13,577
I'm sorry, miss. I didn't want
to cause you trouble

476
00:48:13,966 --> 00:48:15,491
No, sir. It's alright

477
00:48:38,644 --> 00:48:42,638
His Highness cares to
support science

478
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:47,292
I'll put up your petition to His
royal Highness and I hope...

479
00:48:47,681 --> 00:48:50,810
So we may expect the honour of
his visit to school tomorrow?

480
00:48:51,121 --> 00:48:53,556
- God willing
- Long live the prince

481
00:48:59,463 --> 00:49:03,024
Kind and generous by nature..

482
00:49:04,016 --> 00:49:07,077
Blessed and majestic his stature

483
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:08,534
Thanks

484
00:49:10,551 --> 00:49:12,383
- Handsome...
- Thanks

485
00:49:26,227 --> 00:49:29,595
Thank you.. I'm flattered

486
00:49:36,966 --> 00:49:40,266
Perfect! Now you got the rest
of the instructions?

487
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:42,710
Yes, Your Highness,
won't you be with me?

488
00:49:43,048 --> 00:49:44,846
- Right beside you, don't worry
- 0k

489
00:49:46,871 --> 00:49:47,633
Take your position

490
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:58,630
Would Your Highness condescend
to meet the visitors?

491
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:01,739
What is it?

492
00:50:02,686 --> 00:50:06,452
Would Your Highness condescend
to meet the visitors?

493
00:50:08,595 --> 00:50:10,393
I'll condescend, why not?

494
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:23,733
- Bravo! That's perfect
- The shoe is tight

495
00:50:45,855 --> 00:50:47,482
- What's the matter?
- My foot

496
00:50:47,766 --> 00:50:51,225
- Smile while talking
- The shoe's tight, my foot hurts

497
00:50:51,589 --> 00:50:52,784
- Get down
- Alright

498
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:09,792
They're just taking photos of you,
smile and get down

499
00:51:45,984 --> 00:51:46,644
Say something

500
00:51:50,155 --> 00:51:50,986
I miss you all

501
00:51:52,553 --> 00:51:57,047
On behalf of His Highness,
I thank you for welcoming him

502
00:51:57,906 --> 00:52:01,035
and I'm honored to give you
his high appreciation

503
00:52:08,923 --> 00:52:12,450
Allow me to present captain
Blukovsky

504
00:52:13,233 --> 00:52:14,826
the famous pilot

505
00:52:15,145 --> 00:52:16,078
Hello

506
00:52:19,351 --> 00:52:20,284
Is he a pilot?

507
00:52:20,776 --> 00:52:24,041
Yes, he broke a record in altitude

508
00:52:25,085 --> 00:52:30,990
Strange! Air carries much weight

509
00:52:35,304 --> 00:52:38,706


510
00:52:45,106 --> 00:52:46,801
Gobran pasha Elzahlawy,
Your Highness

511
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,848
Hello, Gobran pasha

512
00:52:51,153 --> 00:52:55,056
I pray to God to keep your
grace, prosperity,

513
00:52:55,671 --> 00:53:01,201
your health and your
shining beauty

514
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:04,567
Thanks a lot

515
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:07,359
Gobran pasha is a millionaire

516
00:53:07,628 --> 00:53:11,929
Hello, how are you Gobran pasha?
I miss you so

517
00:53:22,017 --> 00:53:26,978
What do Your Highness think of
the project I presented?

518
00:53:27,821 --> 00:53:32,952
Gobran pasha presented a project
to monopolize the gas resources

519
00:53:34,738 --> 00:53:36,638
That's good. Splendid

520
00:53:38,353 --> 00:53:40,515
But did you take
precautions?

521
00:53:41,064 --> 00:53:43,499
- For what Your Highness?
- Lanterns or candles

522
00:53:46,834 --> 00:53:48,962
- Candles??
- Yes. Candles

523
00:53:49,788 --> 00:53:54,225
When you monopolize all gas
resources, how will lamps light?

524
00:54:30,071 --> 00:54:32,597
His Highness will handle this
issue, Gobran pasha

525
00:54:32,921 --> 00:54:36,789
- Long live His Highness
- May God forgive us

526
00:54:39,108 --> 00:54:42,373
Rostom pasha is one of the old
swordsmen, Your Highness

527
00:54:43,522 --> 00:54:46,719
I saw your late father

528
00:54:47,067 --> 00:54:51,766
prince Karim El-Din Shah

529
00:54:52,803 --> 00:54:54,168
God rest his soul

530
00:54:54,436 --> 00:54:56,666
I was a consul in Persia

531
00:54:56,973 --> 00:54:59,169
Where persian carpets are made

532
00:55:01,387 --> 00:55:06,553
I remember Your Highness was
only 7 years old

533
00:55:07,505 --> 00:55:10,839
I was young and I grew up,
Rostom pasha

534
00:55:11,189 --> 00:55:16,389
I remember an incident that
the newspapers mentioned

535
00:55:16,923 --> 00:55:18,982
Your Highness is fond of hunting
since childhood

536
00:55:19,322 --> 00:55:22,622
Yes, I used to like that thing

537
00:55:23,944 --> 00:55:27,938
The horse bolted and Your Highness
fell on a rock

538
00:55:28,497 --> 00:55:32,798
and the result was some wounds
in your foot

539
00:55:34,476 --> 00:55:36,103
Yes, and they still hurt till now

540
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:41,581
May I dare to ask Your Highness
to attend a party

541
00:55:41,914 --> 00:55:44,679
we will hold tonight in honour
of your visit?

542
00:55:51,055 --> 00:55:52,887
With pleasure, why not?

543
00:55:54,669 --> 00:55:58,071
Miss Maria Lukovitch the
famous Russian explorer

544
00:56:40,862 --> 00:56:41,522
Lady Nahed

545
00:56:47,675 --> 00:56:53,011
His Highness would appreciate
your attending tonight's party

546
00:56:54,278 --> 00:56:58,215
Miss Nahed is my maid,
Your Highness

547
00:56:58,588 --> 00:57:02,786
No problem, we all must gather

548
00:57:03,176 --> 00:57:05,406
I don't deserve this honour,
Your Highness

549
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:10,378
It's alright, you can come.
I love company

550
00:57:13,568 --> 00:57:15,263
That's strange

551
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:21,025
Since when do servants sit side
by side with their masters?

552
00:57:27,054 --> 00:57:29,455
I can feel some hidden things
I don't like

553
00:57:29,765 --> 00:57:33,201
Tell us, what's between you
and that silly secretary?

554
00:57:33,554 --> 00:57:36,114
I can see everything,
I'm not an idiot

555
00:57:37,098 --> 00:57:40,033
Smiles & impolite gestures

556
00:57:40,679 --> 00:57:43,808
I did nothing to deserve
this, madam

557
00:57:44,259 --> 00:57:47,024
They found me alone in the desert
and did me a favour

558
00:57:47,352 --> 00:57:50,413
No, I feel I'll do something bad

559
00:57:50,897 --> 00:57:54,060
I'm afraid I might lose my temper
and strangle him

560
00:57:57,048 --> 00:58:01,747
Nahed, if you smile at this man
again, I'll kill him

561
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:06,620
I'll strangle him, slice him
and dice him

562
00:58:16,478 --> 00:58:18,207
Miss Nahed, you know her?

563
00:58:18,807 --> 00:58:20,775
The desert girl? Yes
Your Highness

564
00:58:21,066 --> 00:58:25,128
That's her, I want you to
treat her perfectly

565
00:58:25,515 --> 00:58:30,112
Yes I see, like flirting,
a wink, a smile

566
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,579
- No, no
- What then?

567
00:58:33,405 --> 00:58:37,899
I mean talk gently,
show sympathy

568
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:40,934
and high appreciation,
you get that?

569
00:58:41,503 --> 00:58:47,306
Yes, high appreciation. Damn you
and your bad idea Rihan

570
00:58:54,433 --> 00:58:56,162
Don't you have a mind?

571
00:58:56,588 --> 00:58:59,489
I thought I did, now I'm
not sure about that

572
00:59:00,167 --> 00:59:04,331
I'm in the fabric business, then
you take me to gas resources..

573
00:59:07,884 --> 00:59:12,082
Listen, you are not supposed
to talk

574
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:15,615
That's better but they start
talking to me

575
00:59:15,912 --> 00:59:17,004
Answer in a simple way

576
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:21,994
In tonight's party,
I'll give you signs

577
00:59:23,003 --> 00:59:26,200
If you're talking well,
I'll cough once

578
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:31,784
If I cough twice like that-

579
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:38,617
it means you're rambling,
so you correct your words

580
00:59:39,721 --> 00:59:42,486
That's good, I like that

581
00:59:53,485 --> 00:59:55,317
Watch it! Be careful
with my foot

582
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:00,849
Do you know how to read?

583
01:00:01,861 --> 01:00:06,697
Be sure about that, Arabic
or your language?

584
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:09,943
Arabic, read this aloud

585
01:00:11,802 --> 01:00:14,703
Future young men, students...

586
01:00:16,355 --> 01:00:19,017
This is the speech you'll
read in a school visit

587
01:00:21,638 --> 01:00:23,197
This one in an asylum visit

588
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:29,335
Tomorrow we'll visit an asylum
for the homeless

589
01:00:30,188 --> 01:00:34,455
and in tonight's party, you'll
read this if you have to

590
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:39,903
Don't forget our deal

591
01:00:45,446 --> 01:00:46,743
Did he come, Sattouta?

592
01:00:48,262 --> 01:00:51,232
No mom, I'm so worried
about him

593
01:00:52,293 --> 01:00:55,354
He's never that late
it's 9 o'clock

594
01:00:56,186 --> 01:01:00,487
Maybe at work, in the shop,
maybe he's in the café..

595
01:01:00,879 --> 01:01:05,874
His friends asked him to stay and
the time passed Um Sattouta

596
01:01:07,135 --> 01:01:10,161
Dark thoughts are haunting me
Um Yanni

597
01:01:11,931 --> 01:01:15,162
He was nervous and confused
when he left

598
01:01:15,929 --> 01:01:19,092
He didn't even have his lunch

599
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:22,759
Sayeda Zeinab, please bring
him back

600
01:01:23,818 --> 01:01:25,718
Your blessings Hussein

601
01:01:30,769 --> 01:01:33,397
Oh God! May it all end well

602
01:01:34,836 --> 01:01:37,703
I wonder what you're doing
now, Salama

603
01:01:47,557 --> 01:01:50,618
Nahed, you were travelling
from Alexandria to Cairo

604
01:01:51,171 --> 01:01:54,937
and my heart was travelling
from Cairo to Alexandria

605
01:01:55,516 --> 01:01:59,646
See I..
How are you, Nahed?

606
01:02:00,069 --> 01:02:01,867
That's strange about dreams,

607
01:02:02,607 --> 01:02:04,769
I once dreamt I rode a donkey

608
01:02:06,152 --> 01:02:07,950
I mean a horse

609
01:02:09,315 --> 01:02:11,215
No, a car

610
01:02:12,790 --> 01:02:15,225
- I was walking
- Then what happened?

611
01:02:20,298 --> 01:02:21,265
Then I woke up

612
01:02:21,688 --> 01:02:23,588
What a sweet dream!

613
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:25,024
Splendid

614
01:02:34,096 --> 01:02:37,327
- I understand
- Be a gentleman

615
01:02:39,936 --> 01:02:43,065
- Desert girl
- Your Highness

616
01:02:43,898 --> 01:02:47,960
You know the American apples whose
ounce's worth 9 piastres?

617
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:49,280
Yes, Your Highness

618
01:02:50,189 --> 01:02:54,854
Your sweetness can spit on
its own

619
01:02:56,341 --> 01:02:57,672
Thanks for your kindness,
Your Highness

620
01:03:22,339 --> 01:03:25,673
Your royal Highness prince Kandahar

621
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:30,143
I find no words to

622
01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:35,519
thank your condescension

623
01:03:51,675 --> 01:03:55,703
Finally, I repeat my thanks

624
01:03:56,088 --> 01:04:00,992
along with the honored guests

625
01:04:12,563 --> 01:04:14,327
Read your reply

626
01:04:26,396 --> 01:04:28,990
Wretched miserables

627
01:04:36,441 --> 01:04:39,467
Great miserables

628
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:48,384
They gathered you in this orphanage
from the streets

629
01:04:48,814 --> 01:04:50,873
fancy ones

630
01:04:53,472 --> 01:04:57,102
Rescued you from hanging out

631
01:04:57,469 --> 01:04:59,460
in cafés and shops

632
01:04:59,971 --> 01:05:03,908
And villas and palaces,
it's written like that

633
01:05:05,081 --> 01:05:07,516
They fed you after famine,

634
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:12,865
and saved you from begging

635
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:35,977
His Highness is touched by
your hospitality

636
01:05:39,803 --> 01:05:43,637
His Highness agreed to join
the roulette party

637
01:05:44,391 --> 01:05:48,385
in support of the
Eye Hospital Project

638
01:06:12,022 --> 01:06:15,720
What a luck, Your Highness.
Congratulations, you are lucky

639
01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:23,372
You didn't see it all yet,
I'll leave you all broke

640
01:06:28,636 --> 01:06:32,630
To compensate your loss, this
would please His Highness

641
01:06:34,371 --> 01:06:35,236
Oh Your Highness

642
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:39,626
Take them, it's not my money

643
01:06:41,670 --> 01:06:44,401
The winnings OK, but not our money.
I don't care

644
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:49,111
What's that? Are we broke
or what?

645
01:06:49,421 --> 01:06:52,584
- The rest of the money
- 118 pounds Your Highness

646
01:06:53,210 --> 01:06:55,008
What? How much?

647
01:06:55,642 --> 01:06:58,304
Your Highness played with 4000

648
01:06:58,770 --> 01:07:02,400
here is 118 so it's 4118

649
01:07:02,872 --> 01:07:05,637
Good grief! 4118 Excuse me, folks

650
01:07:05,965 --> 01:07:07,558
When the marble stops, sir

651
01:07:08,016 --> 01:07:09,450
What? My heart stopped

652
01:07:10,554 --> 01:07:14,491
- His Highness is a bit tired
- Very tired. 4118!

653
01:07:22,058 --> 01:07:25,050
What kind of person are you?
Are you made of stone?

654
01:07:25,846 --> 01:07:28,144
It's my responsibility Mr. Gawdat

655
01:07:28,696 --> 01:07:31,495
We had no Egyptian currency
so we used your sum

656
01:07:32,172 --> 01:07:35,107
How come you suspect that...

657
01:07:35,439 --> 01:07:36,702
Forgive me, sir. People should
help each other

658
01:07:38,985 --> 01:07:41,249
When will you exchange
currency tomorrow?

659
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:45,495
This man's presence will cause
scandals, Your Highness

660
01:07:57,648 --> 01:08:00,413
- Don't utter a word from now
- I won't, sir

661
01:08:01,055 --> 01:08:05,492
Just answer with one word;
yes, no, how nice..

662
01:08:05,886 --> 01:08:08,116
May God bless

663
01:08:08,563 --> 01:08:12,522
OK, sir. Yes, no, how nice,
may God bless

664
01:08:13,046 --> 01:08:15,708
When will you exchange
currency tomorrow?

665
01:08:24,134 --> 01:08:25,033
Where are we going now?

666
01:08:25,246 --> 01:08:30,377
Different visits. As I told you,
don't say except yes..

667
01:08:30,807 --> 01:08:33,276
No, how nice, may God bless

668
01:08:37,341 --> 01:08:39,867
Shouldn't Mr Gawdat go to the
bank to exchange currency?

669
01:08:40,295 --> 01:08:41,228
Back to nagging?

670
01:08:41,478 --> 01:08:42,604
No, sir, it's OK

671
01:08:42,903 --> 01:08:44,371
Yes, no, how nice, may God bless

672
01:08:52,808 --> 01:08:54,469
With these preparations

673
01:08:55,103 --> 01:09:01,201
the brigade can extinguish about
10 to 12 fires daily

674
01:09:03,166 --> 01:09:07,069
How nice! May God bless

675
01:09:23,082 --> 01:09:25,346
We welcome the prince

676
01:09:38,236 --> 01:09:42,469
As soon as the prince enters,
you all rise

677
01:09:43,136 --> 01:09:46,538
On my signal, you start chanting,
you get that?

678
01:09:47,098 --> 01:09:48,156
Yes, we do

679
01:09:51,235 --> 01:09:53,499
- You Abdullah
- Yes, sir

680
01:09:53,945 --> 01:09:56,004
- Your voice is weak
- How come, sir?

681
01:09:56,622 --> 01:09:59,956
- Raise your voice a bit
- My voice is so clear

682
01:10:00,445 --> 01:10:02,140
Her heart has beaten and

683
01:10:03,087 --> 01:10:07,149
she loved me

684
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:08,230
Sit down

685
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:22,522
All rise! One, two

686
01:11:07,109 --> 01:11:11,103
This saluting chant is written by
Mr. Bayoumi Morgan

687
01:11:12,670 --> 01:11:17,039
It shows from the good words
and the lovely voices

688
01:11:18,579 --> 01:11:20,104
Bravo Mr. Bayoumi Fengan

689
01:11:20,386 --> 01:11:24,380
Morgan, sir. I can't find words..

690
01:11:24,765 --> 01:11:28,998
It's not important, Thank you,
Mr. Bayoumi Betengan (eggplant)

691
01:11:29,806 --> 01:11:31,865
Betengan.. Betengan

692
01:11:35,332 --> 01:11:37,232
It's a math class, Your Highness

693
01:11:38,772 --> 01:11:41,673
- Math? You teach math?
- Yes, Your Highness

694
01:11:42,005 --> 01:11:43,939
How nice

695
01:11:49,443 --> 01:11:53,846
Many people cannot do math,
Mr. Bayoumi. Go on

696
01:11:54,413 --> 01:11:55,903
- Alright Your Highness
- Go on!

697
01:11:58,758 --> 01:12:02,661
Alright, sir. A man
bought 20 metres

698
01:12:03,833 --> 01:12:06,962
of silk, 31 milliemes each

699
01:12:12,383 --> 01:12:15,785
Silk with 3 pt and 1 millieme?
Where is that?

700
01:12:16,276 --> 01:12:18,836
Of what kind? The Japanese
costs 7 pt,

701
01:12:19,542 --> 01:12:25,072
marcilia No.2 costs 16 pt,
colorful 70 cm wide costs 22 pt

702
01:12:25,903 --> 01:12:29,339
- Mahalawy extra..
- It's just a hypothesis

703
01:12:29,761 --> 01:12:34,597
Oh! I thought it was real,
it would be ruin to the owner

704
01:12:36,678 --> 01:12:40,842
- His Highness is a good reader
- In various fields

705
01:12:41,335 --> 01:12:46,739
And he paid 1/4 of the price and
the rest on 50 installments

706
01:12:50,094 --> 01:12:52,085
- Who's that crazy owner?
- Your Highness..

707
01:12:53,048 --> 01:12:57,451
That's crazy, he will be dead
before taking his money

708
01:13:03,336 --> 01:13:06,328
It's him, I can't miss Salama

709
01:13:10,461 --> 01:13:14,591
How come? It's a strange story

710
01:13:16,648 --> 01:13:18,446
Any news about him?

711
01:13:18,872 --> 01:13:21,705
No, Um Mahmoud, I'm going crazy

712
01:13:22,627 --> 01:13:26,427
- You didn't look in hospitals?
- God forbid

713
01:13:26,797 --> 01:13:28,925
Speak good omen

714
01:13:29,786 --> 01:13:33,450
Streets are dangerous these days,
trams make accidents.

715
01:13:33,922 --> 01:13:36,584
Oh my God, may it all end well

716
01:13:36,877 --> 01:13:40,074
What a pity!

717
01:13:40,527 --> 01:13:44,327
- Be patient
- Where is he staying?

718
01:13:44,766 --> 01:13:47,360
- Nefertiti Hotel
- Let's go to him

719
01:13:47,686 --> 01:13:48,881
Yes, let's go

720
01:13:52,135 --> 01:13:53,102
Um Sattouta

721
01:13:54,498 --> 01:13:59,265
- Yes, any news?
- We found him, let's go

722
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:43,012
This is the oldest person
in the asylum

723
01:15:44,017 --> 01:15:46,987
- How nice
- He's here for 12 years

724
01:15:47,633 --> 01:15:49,829
He was an employee
in a fabric shop

725
01:15:53,055 --> 01:15:54,147
A salesman?

726
01:15:54,376 --> 01:15:55,571
No, a servant

727
01:15:56,426 --> 01:16:01,956
- You clean the shop?
- No, I serve water, get papers

728
01:16:02,508 --> 01:16:05,944
- Office man not a servant
- He did something bad

729
01:16:07,375 --> 01:16:08,934
Stole some fabric?

730
01:16:09,216 --> 01:16:14,347
No, they sent me to withdraw
350 pounds from the bank

731
01:16:15,298 --> 01:16:20,998
I went to deliver them but the
shop was closed as..

732
01:16:21,416 --> 01:16:26,411
- The owner's wife's in labour
- No, the owner's wife's dead

733
01:16:27,638 --> 01:16:32,303
- Then what?
- I left the sum with a good man

734
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:35,184
When I asked him about it,
he denied

735
01:16:35,944 --> 01:16:38,174
Good, when will you
exchange currency?

736
01:16:38,516 --> 01:16:41,850
No need to hurry, sir.
Your donation..

737
01:16:42,166 --> 01:16:45,659
- Will you exchange currency?
- Then what?

738
01:16:46,025 --> 01:16:49,655
- They took me to jail
- Splendid

739
01:16:50,126 --> 01:16:53,528
- I went out and found my house ruined
- How nice!

740
01:16:53,879 --> 01:16:56,371
- And my wife begging
- How wonderful!

741
01:16:58,641 --> 01:17:01,872
- Your Highness
- When will you exchange currency?

742
01:17:22,310 --> 01:17:25,871
- Relaxed now? Got your money?
- Yes, thank God

743
01:17:27,245 --> 01:17:30,943
You don't get it, when I took
this sum from the shop to..

744
01:17:34,371 --> 01:17:36,999
There's no need for insults
anymore

745
01:17:37,290 --> 01:17:41,090
- No sir, no insults. When I..
- Shut up

746
01:17:43,164 --> 01:17:46,657
If you go back to nagging,
I'll hurt you

747
01:17:47,022 --> 01:17:48,512
No sir, there's no need for that

748
01:17:50,185 --> 01:17:52,813
When I took this sum from
the shop.. Alright!

749
01:18:00,057 --> 01:18:03,254
I have an appointment with His
Highness, will he arrive soon?

750
01:18:03,602 --> 01:18:05,570
He won't be late, wait for him

751
01:18:09,858 --> 01:18:14,091
Sit down auntie Um Sattouta,
he's coming soon

752
01:18:30,121 --> 01:18:31,054
Dear Salama!

753
01:18:52,469 --> 01:18:54,494
- Who are they?
- My family

754
01:18:54,972 --> 01:18:58,374
- They are so low standard
- I told you so

755
01:19:01,194 --> 01:19:03,856
Impossible, I'm sure it's him

756
01:19:05,330 --> 01:19:07,822
How come? I'm not married to
an Italian man

757
01:19:08,145 --> 01:19:10,204
He speaks so fluently

758
01:19:11,934 --> 01:19:16,838
Even if he speaks Japanese,
it's him. I'll disclose him

759
01:19:22,708 --> 01:19:27,202
The factory supplies fabrics for the
Afghan, Kuwaiti and Shatt armies

760
01:19:29,208 --> 01:19:33,406
We hope to supply the Bloudestani
army needs too

761
01:19:34,039 --> 01:19:38,533
- How much is that army?
- 12000, your memory's weak, sir

762
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:41,204
God help me, I've got so many
things to remember

763
01:19:45,475 --> 01:19:47,739
What army uses this delicate
pink color?

764
01:19:48,220 --> 01:19:52,418
- Those are ladies silk samples
- I see

765
01:20:11,229 --> 01:20:14,221
- The gifts were delivered?
- Yes, Your Highness

766
01:20:15,469 --> 01:20:18,598
A token of admiration for miss
Nahed's charm.. Kandahar

767
01:20:26,418 --> 01:20:32,323
I present this souvenir with
my regards.. Kandahar

768
01:20:39,556 --> 01:20:42,617
- Wonderful dad
- A real prince's gift

769
01:20:42,962 --> 01:20:46,125
This is one great souvenir

770
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:48,704
Didn't he send anything
for me, dad?

771
01:20:56,065 --> 01:20:57,692
I was sure that I..

772
01:20:59,437 --> 01:21:00,836
Shouldn't we go thank him, dad?

773
01:21:02,009 --> 01:21:04,944
Sure

774
01:21:08,473 --> 01:21:11,238
I want His Highness's suite
please, miss

775
01:21:11,637 --> 01:21:13,366
How come this is natural?
It's artificial

776
01:21:15,252 --> 01:21:18,517
what do you think? Princes
never bought or sold?

777
01:21:19,422 --> 01:21:21,550
You get me meat telling me
it's chicken?

778
01:21:30,961 --> 01:21:33,055
May I have the permission
to meet His Highness?

779
01:21:33,498 --> 01:21:34,329
Who are you?

780
01:21:39,998 --> 01:21:41,363
Please come in

781
01:21:43,647 --> 01:21:45,638
OK, His Highness will handle
this issue

782
01:21:46,359 --> 01:21:47,155
Thanks, Your Highness

783
01:22:05,058 --> 01:22:07,857
Oh! Pretty woman

784
01:22:23,444 --> 01:22:25,435
- What are you doing?
- Relaxing a bit

785
01:22:25,704 --> 01:22:27,331
- Put your clothes on
- What is it now?

786
01:22:27,581 --> 01:22:28,844
- She's here to see you
- Who?

787
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:32,341
- Miss Nahed
- The desert girl again?

788
01:22:36,027 --> 01:22:38,428
I don't know what's the idea
behind all that

789
01:22:39,225 --> 01:22:44,186
We haven't had dinner yet. Should
a prince work while hungry?

790
01:22:47,601 --> 01:22:53,597
As I told you, be gentle.
Promise her with money, love..

791
01:22:54,205 --> 01:22:56,071
With everything, I'll pay no money

792
01:23:05,501 --> 01:23:09,233
- Good evening Your Highness
- Hello! Good evening

793
01:23:09,776 --> 01:23:13,474
Sit down, make yourself at home.
How are you?

794
01:23:13,842 --> 01:23:17,369
I'm here to thank you for the
precious gift you bestowed on me

795
01:23:17,735 --> 01:23:21,569
You've seen nothing yet.
I'll give you more, I don't care

796
01:23:24,652 --> 01:23:29,852
I want to buy all jewelry
for the sake of your beauty

797
01:23:30,247 --> 01:23:30,907
Your Highness

798
01:23:31,151 --> 01:23:36,146
You're driving me crazy

799
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:41,676
- Please stop!
- I can't stop my dear, come on

800
01:23:42,516 --> 01:23:44,177
Please stop! Don't make me
ill-treat you

801
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:50,683
- Don't be silly
- Give it to whom deserves it

802
01:23:51,484 --> 01:23:52,883
Your opinion about me is
very wrong

803
01:24:00,798 --> 01:24:02,232
Please allow me
to explain..

804
01:24:02,502 --> 01:24:06,405
Enough please. I'm sorry about
one thing, my good intentions

805
01:24:06,846 --> 01:24:08,280
I thought you were better people

806
01:24:18,142 --> 01:24:20,736
- You play a very cheap game
- Madam I...

807
01:24:21,306 --> 01:24:23,900
Shut up! What you dream of
is never yours

808
01:24:24,538 --> 01:24:26,506
Next time, pick someone
your own standard

809
01:24:26,796 --> 01:24:31,427
- Madam I..
- Go pack and leave, you're fired

810
01:24:45,601 --> 01:24:49,333
A wonderful gift that I'll
cherish all my life

811
01:24:50,536 --> 01:24:51,799
A great souvenir

812
01:24:52,065 --> 01:24:56,559
that'll remind me when I see it
of the lovely hours I was lucky

813
01:24:56,966 --> 01:24:59,401
to spend beside you

814
01:25:23,208 --> 01:25:24,175
Miss Nahed!

815
01:25:56,261 --> 01:25:58,593
They were really sweet hours

816
01:25:59,425 --> 01:26:03,521
If it hadn't been for the briefcase,
it would have been perfect

817
01:26:03,873 --> 01:26:07,468
- You lost something?
- I was about to but it's OK

818
01:26:18,123 --> 01:26:22,583
While I wore this precious necklace,
I looked in the mirror

819
01:26:24,345 --> 01:26:27,781
I was so happy that,
while daydreaming,

820
01:26:28,203 --> 01:26:31,503
I opened my arms and kissed
the mirror

821
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:36,347
- I wish I were the mirror
- Really? You...

822
01:26:38,143 --> 01:26:40,771
- Yes, so much
- Is it so?

823
01:26:41,271 --> 01:26:43,933
It is so and so

824
01:26:46,103 --> 01:26:50,563
- I have the mayor's permit
- As the hotel manager I can't..

825
01:26:51,212 --> 01:26:52,702
I also have a warrant

826
01:26:54,792 --> 01:26:57,784
Do you love me, Kandahar?
Do you love Gihan?

827
01:26:58,129 --> 01:26:59,858
Who else shall I love?
Small fish?

828
01:27:00,144 --> 01:27:03,808
Don't play with my feelings.
Please don't break my heart

829
01:27:04,177 --> 01:27:05,667
I'm going crazy

830
01:27:05,914 --> 01:27:10,181
I'll die if you leave me.
What brought me here?

831
01:27:10,537 --> 01:27:14,565
- Your father
- And what brought you here?

832
01:27:15,055 --> 01:27:15,954
The briefcase

833
01:27:19,747 --> 01:27:23,047
It can't be true. It must be
a false report

834
01:27:23,884 --> 01:27:26,979
Maybe, but I have a job
to finish

835
01:27:31,252 --> 01:27:34,950
See how happiness makes you feel?

836
01:27:37,473 --> 01:27:39,498
Yes, I can perfectly see

837
01:27:50,959 --> 01:27:53,553
What is it, hotel man?

838
01:27:54,122 --> 01:27:57,717
Sorry sir, a police request

839
01:28:00,379 --> 01:28:03,440
- For whom?
- Someone called Salama

840
01:28:06,253 --> 01:28:10,622
Who is Salama?
Call for Salama

841
01:28:11,014 --> 01:28:13,415
I have a clear report,
and I must investigate

842
01:28:13,725 --> 01:28:18,424
Go ahead. Rostom pasha,
call my secretariat for me please

843
01:28:19,390 --> 01:28:20,983
There is no one, they all left

844
01:28:21,302 --> 01:28:23,270
Left? They did it?

845
01:28:23,735 --> 01:28:27,069
They didn't say anything
or leave anything?

846
01:28:27,419 --> 01:28:29,888
- No
- How wondeful!

847
01:28:35,831 --> 01:28:39,358
Before the circumstances I told
you about, I couldn't

848
01:28:40,036 --> 01:28:42,403
appreciate the value of your
lovely nature

849
01:28:42,886 --> 01:28:46,254
and discover a proud personality
I thought it never existed

850
01:28:46,675 --> 01:28:49,838
I can't believe this,
it's just like movies

851
01:28:50,811 --> 01:28:52,370
That's what's sweet about it, Nahed

852
01:28:54,356 --> 01:28:56,586
Can I call you Nahed?

853
01:29:01,272 --> 01:29:04,537
The bank was closed. I went home
to find the copperware..

854
01:29:04,887 --> 01:29:09,688
- You are really an office man?
- Yes I am

855
01:29:10,101 --> 01:29:12,536
You joker, you fool, you idiot!

856
01:29:13,055 --> 01:29:15,319
Thank you Mr. smart mind

857
01:29:26,089 --> 01:29:26,851
Thanks a lot

858
01:29:28,417 --> 01:29:30,943
Come, Your Highness, honour
the jail with your visit

859
01:29:31,719 --> 01:29:36,748
>From royal suite to jail.
But the briefcase is fine

860
01:29:38,254 --> 01:29:40,814
Come here, where are you going,
thief? To steal something?

861
01:29:41,139 --> 01:29:46,600
Shut up! I've enough money to
buy you and your whole hotel

862
01:29:48,889 --> 01:29:51,517
You think I come from the street?

863
01:29:52,191 --> 01:29:55,627
You think I'm broke?
Come take a look

864
01:29:58,830 --> 01:30:02,095
Good grief! What a terrible day!
It's a disaster

865
01:30:04,878 --> 01:30:06,972
When they left, didn't they
tell you...

866
01:30:07,276 --> 01:30:08,675
- Take him to the station
- My money!

867
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,162
I can't get a grip of my mind.

868
01:30:19,059 --> 01:30:22,029
I haven't slept for 48 hours

869
01:30:22,465 --> 01:30:25,901
- Really?
- I'm so happy, how can I sleep?

870
01:30:27,191 --> 01:30:32,220
Everybody said he looks
exactly like me

871
01:30:32,683 --> 01:30:35,709
How handsome!
What did you name him?

872
01:30:36,229 --> 01:30:40,462
- Mankaraa
- Mankaraa? Lovely

873
01:30:41,060 --> 01:30:42,858
musical name

874
01:30:43,145 --> 01:30:48,174
My wife doesn't like it,
she wants to call him Joseph

875
01:30:49,088 --> 01:30:53,286
Mankaraa is better. May you see
him a man, Mr. Khalil

876
01:30:53,677 --> 01:30:55,873
and a great shop owner

877
01:30:56,179 --> 01:31:00,582
No, no. I don't want to teach him
to be a liar

878
01:31:02,401 --> 01:31:07,202
A man from Alexandria sent me
some poetry

879
01:31:07,579 --> 01:31:09,013
Lovely

880
01:31:13,036 --> 01:31:15,767
Where are my glasses?
Get Salama

881
01:31:16,164 --> 01:31:21,034
- Salama didn't come
- Why? Another one died?

882
01:31:21,517 --> 01:31:23,781
And he didn't deliver the
bank's receipt

883
01:31:24,506 --> 01:31:29,876
- The bank's receipt?
- I gave him 4118 LE. on Saturday

884
01:31:30,310 --> 01:31:33,803
and never heard from him since then.
What's worse Mr. Khalil..

885
01:31:35,559 --> 01:31:36,219
There..

886
01:31:47,689 --> 01:31:51,353
Maybe the owner sent him somewhere.
Please go ask him

887
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:54,883
- This matter is..
- Have mercy

888
01:31:55,231 --> 01:31:58,098
Please sir, she hasn't slept
for 2 days

889
01:31:58,777 --> 01:32:01,974
They look exactly the same

890
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:06,821
Ask about him at home,
maybe he's sick

891
01:32:07,883 --> 01:32:11,683
Are you heartless? Will you tell
him or I call to him?

892
01:32:12,644 --> 01:32:15,113
Mr. Khalil.. sir

893
01:32:16,676 --> 01:32:19,577
What's that noise? What is it?
Who are they?

894
01:32:20,082 --> 01:32:22,642
- I'm Salama's wife, sir
- You're his wife? Where is he?

895
01:32:22,967 --> 01:32:27,598
I'm here to ask about him,
he hasn't come home for 2 days

896
01:32:28,041 --> 01:32:31,409
Hasn't come home for 2 days?
How? Come with me

897
01:32:37,565 --> 01:32:40,466
Of course I didn't buy it.
As soon as he left,

898
01:32:40,797 --> 01:32:42,424
I reported it to the police

899
01:32:42,848 --> 01:32:45,442
The idiot pretends to be a prince
and comes to visit the school

900
01:32:45,767 --> 01:32:50,568
He knows all types of silk.
I'm not an idiot

901
01:32:50,981 --> 01:32:54,611
We never would've
doubted Salama..

902
01:32:55,221 --> 01:32:57,053
I have no time, I must meet
Mr. Khalil

903
01:32:57,481 --> 01:33:00,781
- He's upstairs
- I'll ruin your life Salama

904
01:33:04,328 --> 01:33:05,853
Tell me what are
your charges, man?

905
01:33:08,603 --> 01:33:09,866
I had a fight

906
01:33:10,132 --> 01:33:13,534
Just 6 months, I took 5 years

907
01:33:14,651 --> 01:33:17,120
He impersonated a prince?

908
01:33:19,934 --> 01:33:21,561
Didn't he have any money
with him?

909
01:33:22,228 --> 01:33:24,890
Just a briefcase with
fabric samples

910
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:28,680
He must have put them away
and prepared himself

911
01:33:29,005 --> 01:33:33,966
- Did he steal anything?
- 4118 pounds

912
01:33:34,392 --> 01:33:38,226
Wonderful! He'll spend 6 years
in prison

913
01:33:38,703 --> 01:33:40,330
What a pity, Salama!

914
01:33:47,357 --> 01:33:48,153
Bank Misr?

915
01:33:56,497 --> 01:33:57,987
Mr. Salama? What happened?

916
01:33:58,270 --> 01:34:00,295
He's a friend of mine,
I'll pick fabrics for him

917
01:34:06,056 --> 01:34:11,187
- He didn't deliver anything
- I told you he was a sly fox

918
01:34:12,312 --> 01:34:15,771
He's a poisonous snake,

919
01:34:16,136 --> 01:34:20,073
curled to bite and hide

920
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:22,710
May a snake bite your heart

921
01:34:24,686 --> 01:34:25,482
Salama!!

922
01:34:34,383 --> 01:34:36,715
- Have a nice day sir!
- Have an awful day!

923
01:34:37,233 --> 01:34:40,965
- It's a dreadful day, sir
- Is this your office man Salama?

924
01:34:41,334 --> 01:34:42,733
- It's me, sir
- Shut up!

925
01:34:43,767 --> 01:34:46,896
- Take him
- Where to?

926
01:34:47,278 --> 01:34:50,213
One minute please.
May you undo the cuffs?

927
01:34:50,545 --> 01:34:51,444
OK

928
01:34:53,221 --> 01:34:55,781
Give me your hand,
may it be broken

929
01:34:58,227 --> 01:34:59,092
Come here, Salama

930
01:35:07,750 --> 01:35:10,344
Sit down. Don't be scared

931
01:35:17,898 --> 01:35:23,837
- If you only understand, sir
- I want no scandals, sit and relax

932
01:35:27,561 --> 01:35:31,361
Thank you, sir. May you
drop dead Mr. Rihan

933
01:35:33,053 --> 01:35:35,750
Damn you, Your Highness of
Bloudestan

934
01:35:36,146 --> 01:35:39,343
You want to be saved from
serving 10 years in prison?

935
01:35:39,969 --> 01:35:41,903
I'm not interested in hard labour

936
01:35:42,229 --> 01:35:46,063
- The money
- That's the problem

937
01:35:46,434 --> 01:35:49,062
- Save yourself and deliver it
- How?

938
01:35:49,944 --> 01:35:52,345
- How much did you waste?
- All of it

939
01:35:53,559 --> 01:35:56,290
Take this thief to jail

940
01:35:57,417 --> 01:36:00,318
- Your hand, criminal
- There you are

941
01:36:00,650 --> 01:36:04,985
Save yourself and give back
the money

942
01:36:05,377 --> 01:36:07,175
Yes, give it back, you swindler!

943
01:36:12,676 --> 01:36:15,043
May I have a word, sir?
I have a way out

944
01:36:15,352 --> 01:36:20,813
Great! Bring him here.
Sit down and relax. Talk

945
01:36:26,265 --> 01:36:27,096
Yes?

946
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:36,953
- They are 4118 pounds, right?
- Yes

947
01:36:37,875 --> 01:36:40,845
You can deduct them from
my monthly salary

948
01:36:41,523 --> 01:36:45,653
Deduct 4118 pound from your

949
01:36:46,042 --> 01:36:47,908
8 pound salary?

950
01:36:48,544 --> 01:36:49,841
How many years must you live?

951
01:36:50,804 --> 01:36:53,136
Some people may live to 120
or 150 years

952
01:36:53,411 --> 01:36:56,642
Take him to jail, that thief

953
01:37:10,651 --> 01:37:12,415
Is that the end of it?
You steal?

954
01:37:12,666 --> 01:37:16,227
Shame on you, Sattouta.
It's just bad luck

955
01:37:17,011 --> 01:37:20,572
I'll fry a chicken and wait for you
at the prison

956
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:25,347
Salama?

957
01:37:25,595 --> 01:37:28,530
Help me, Your Highness.
You saw it all

958
01:37:28,828 --> 01:37:31,160
- Yes, it's OK
- How? I'm going to jail

959
01:37:31,469 --> 01:37:35,702
No, don't be afraid.
There officer

960
01:37:40,229 --> 01:37:42,493
Yes, but I'm sorry.
Take him, sergeant

961
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:46,661
- How? You have a warrant
- Yes, but he has another charge

962
01:37:47,214 --> 01:37:51,378
- Another charge?
- Yes, he stole 4118 pounds

963
01:37:51,767 --> 01:37:56,671
4118 pounds? How come?
Didn't I give you that sum?

964
01:37:57,398 --> 01:37:59,765
Please Your Highness,
I beg Your Highness

965
01:38:02,646 --> 01:38:06,105
When you suggested that I put the
money in the hotel's safe box

966
01:38:06,539 --> 01:38:08,268
and I told you to keep it
with <i>me..</i>

967
01:38:08,729 --> 01:38:11,960
- Take him to the station
- I beg Your Highness

968
01:38:12,553 --> 01:38:14,146
Move, prisoner

969
01:38:16,410 --> 01:38:20,677
Please, officer, may I speak
with you about this issue?

970
01:38:22,423 --> 01:38:24,790
In the presence of Mr. Khalil

971
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:28,092
- Is this his office?
- Come please

972
01:38:32,329 --> 01:38:35,162
- You are Mr. Khalil Hindawy?
- Yes

973
01:38:38,203 --> 01:38:41,138
I have something to say
about Salama

974
01:38:42,235 --> 01:38:47,230
He is the victim of a trick and

975
01:38:47,935 --> 01:38:51,599
I'll pay the money for him
- till he proves his innocence

976
01:38:52,350 --> 01:38:53,078
Please come in

977
01:38:55,790 --> 01:39:01,092
Congratulations. May God
bless your kid

978
01:39:02,985 --> 01:39:05,477
Hello. Excuse me

979
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:10,397
I'm in a hurry, I'm leaving in
30 minutes. These are the samples

980
01:39:11,291 --> 01:39:13,851
and I care to finish this
issue now

981
01:39:16,505 --> 01:39:18,940
I have fabrics that aren't
in the market yet

982
01:39:23,769 --> 01:39:24,600
What is that?

983
01:39:30,095 --> 01:39:30,926
That's not my briefcase

984
01:39:31,207 --> 01:39:33,198
Not your briefcase? Show me

985
01:39:35,969 --> 01:39:38,666
- This is Salama's briefcase
- Salama's briefcase?

986
01:39:41,391 --> 01:39:44,918
Your delicate mood couldn't bear
hammering above

987
01:39:45,458 --> 01:39:48,155
They'll break your bones
in hard labour

988
01:39:48,482 --> 01:39:51,110
May a rusty train break
your bones

989
01:39:54,912 --> 01:39:55,970
Wait sergeant!

990
01:40:01,723 --> 01:40:03,521
I'm sorry, Mr. Salama

991
01:40:03,844 --> 01:40:04,675
Set him free, sergeant!

992
01:40:15,835 --> 01:40:19,829
- You are a real gem, Salama. There
- Strange

993
01:40:20,250 --> 01:40:23,652
I promised you 500 pounds.
Here you are Salama

994
01:40:24,108 --> 01:40:25,872
And 200 pounds from me, Salama

995
01:40:27,375 --> 01:40:29,104
- Who? Desert girl?
- My fiancée

996
01:40:30,051 --> 01:40:33,646
- From now you are storage manager
- How strange!

997
01:40:34,047 --> 01:40:36,015
What is it, Salama? Tell me

998
01:40:36,307 --> 01:40:39,436
Either they lost their minds
or I lost mine, Sattouta

999
01:40:39,748 --> 01:40:42,274
Now give me back my briefcase,
Your Highness

1000
01:40:42,598 --> 01:40:44,828
- Is it you? I'll ruin your day
- Let him go, Salama

1001
01:40:45,135 --> 01:40:47,570
- How? My money
- I took it, Salama

1002
01:40:53,268 --> 01:40:54,599
Congratulations, Your Highness

1003
01:40:55,562 --> 01:40:59,556
How nice, may God bless

1004
01:41:00,603 --> 01:41:01,729
Let's go

1005
01:41:03,869 --> 01:41:08,773
Congratulations my friend, my dear
neighbour. Give me a kiss

1006
01:41:09,187 --> 01:41:11,281
Go away, kiss a snake

1007
01:41:11,620 --> 01:41:14,487
Better than you I have never seen

1008
01:41:14,818 --> 01:41:17,549
Sweeter than you has never been

1009
01:41:18,051 --> 01:41:21,783
- It is so now? Strange.. listen
- Yes

1010
01:41:22,430 --> 01:41:25,092
If you are no friend in bad times

1011
01:41:25,592 --> 01:41:28,118
then you're no good in good times

1012
01:41:30,423 --> 01:41:35,384
- I can understand nothing
- Better not to, take these

1013
01:41:35,881 --> 01:41:39,511
Ok dear, it's none of my business.
It's good that Salama is fine

1014
01:41:40,398 --> 01:41:41,763
And fine is Salama!
