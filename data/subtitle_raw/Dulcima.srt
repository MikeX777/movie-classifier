1
00:03:31,585 --> 00:03:33,001
Oh, Mr. Parker'.

2
00:03:36,084 --> 00:03:40,375
Oh, Mr. Parker.

3
00:03:40,376 --> 00:03:42,167
Oh, whatever happened?

4
00:03:42,168 --> 00:03:43,168
Are you all right?

5
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:45,167
Did you hurt yourself?

6
00:03:45,168 --> 00:03:47,500
Oh!

7
00:03:50,334 --> 00:03:51,751
Oh shush, Arnold.

8
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,626
That's it, you stay there.

9
00:04:03,668 --> 00:04:05,043
Oh, careful, Mr. Parker.

10
00:04:14,626 --> 00:04:15,626
Hello?

11
00:04:19,334 --> 00:04:23,168
Here, you come and sit
over here, Mr. Parker.

12
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:32,001
That's it, I'll make you a cup of tea.

13
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:35,334
You haven't got much to say, have you?

14
00:04:48,126 --> 00:04:50,625
You let your stuff get into
a rare mess, Mr. Parker.

15
00:04:50,626 --> 00:04:51,501
Don't you have no one to come in

16
00:04:51,502 --> 00:04:53,459
and clean the place for you?

17
00:04:54,626 --> 00:04:56,168
It's about time somebody did.

18
00:05:03,793 --> 00:05:05,208
If I get time tomorrow,

19
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:06,292
I'll come and give the place a bit

20
00:05:06,293 --> 00:05:07,418
of a cleanup for you.

21
00:05:09,334 --> 00:05:11,375
Oh, that does hurt?

22
00:05:28,626 --> 00:05:30,543
You feeling better now, Mr. Parker?

23
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,167
You wanna take care of yourself

24
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,584
or you'll be killing
yourself one of these days.

25
00:06:36,626 --> 00:06:38,042
Here's your hat, Mr. Parker.

26
00:06:38,043 --> 00:06:39,959
You dropped it outside.

27
00:07:01,376 --> 00:07:03,125
You've been gone a long time, Dulcima.

28
00:07:03,126 --> 00:07:04,458
I'm sorry, Ma.

29
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:06,333
Children, children, shh!

30
00:07:06,334 --> 00:07:08,833
Rowena, Abigail, stop that noise!

31
00:07:08,834 --> 00:07:10,583
Your father's having a rest.

32
00:07:10,584 --> 00:07:11,625
Go on, get some water in for me,

33
00:07:11,626 --> 00:07:13,458
there's a good girl.

34
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:14,834
Oh yeah, all right, Ma.

35
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:32,000
Be, quiet, Abigail, Rowena, now go on.

36
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:33,958
Go on play, go on.

37
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:34,793
Go on down the field.

38
00:07:34,793 --> 00:07:35,626
Dulce!

39
00:07:35,627 --> 00:07:36,917
Get me some more tea.

40
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:38,751
I've let this get cold.

41
00:07:45,751 --> 00:07:49,000
Dulcima, someone here waiting.

42
00:08:03,834 --> 00:08:04,834
Dulce!

43
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:06,751
Dulce!

44
00:08:15,251 --> 00:08:17,501
Dulce, get me a cup of tea!

45
00:08:19,126 --> 00:08:20,583
Put some water on, Dulce,

46
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:21,418
I wanna have a wash.

47
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,458
And I want some new shoes!

48
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:24,750
I've been walking about on bare feet

49
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:26,083
for a week now!

50
00:08:26,084 --> 00:08:28,042
I won't be treated like a dog!

51
00:08:28,043 --> 00:08:31,000
Hey Dulce, do this Dulce, do that Dulce.

52
00:08:31,001 --> 00:08:33,251
I'll Dulce myself out of here one day!

53
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:39,751
Whatever's gotten into Dulcima?

54
00:09:55,668 --> 00:09:58,042
How do you feel today, Mr. Parker?

55
00:09:58,043 --> 00:09:59,043
Ain't so bad.

56
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,418
Does your head hurt?

57
00:10:03,543 --> 00:10:04,626
That's all right.

58
00:10:09,251 --> 00:10:10,708
I said I'd come up and give your place

59
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:12,125
a bit of a cleanup.

60
00:10:12,126 --> 00:10:13,126
Yeah.

61
00:10:15,001 --> 00:10:16,751
You pick up my hat yesterday?

62
00:10:19,084 --> 00:10:21,209
I picked it up, I put it in the kitchen.

63
00:10:25,043 --> 00:10:26,625
You didn't lose nothing, did you?

64
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,876
No, not that I know of.

65
00:10:28,834 --> 00:10:31,001
You did not give that henhouse a wallop.

66
00:11:15,584 --> 00:11:16,584
Shoo!

67
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:50,001
Oh, hello, Mr. Parker.

68
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:51,500
I haven't had much time

69
00:12:51,501 --> 00:12:52,459
but it's a bit better.

70
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:53,459
Yeah.

71
00:13:57,209 --> 00:13:58,833
Oh.

72
00:13:58,834 --> 00:13:59,875
I don't know what you want for your supper

73
00:13:59,876 --> 00:14:01,459
but this is all I could find.

74
00:14:44,043 --> 00:14:47,667
You'll have to get
yourself some new curtains.

75
00:14:47,668 --> 00:14:49,334
I ain't got money for curtains.

76
00:14:55,751 --> 00:14:57,042
Well you have to.

77
00:14:57,043 --> 00:14:59,208
Those others won't stand another wash.

78
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:00,668
Well I ain't made of money.

79
00:15:01,543 --> 00:15:02,751
I've got a living to get.

80
00:15:08,626 --> 00:15:10,043
What's your name?

81
00:15:11,376 --> 00:15:12,625
Gaskain.

82
00:15:12,626 --> 00:15:15,042
One of George Gaskain's lot, right?

83
00:15:15,043 --> 00:15:16,043
Yes.

84
00:15:17,293 --> 00:15:18,833
Which one are you?

85
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:19,668
Dulcima.

86
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:22,708
Ah, that's a funny name innit?

87
00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:24,293
What they call you?

88
00:15:25,751 --> 00:15:28,333
Dulce or else Dulcie.

89
00:15:28,334 --> 00:15:30,501
It's worse than Dulcima.

90
00:15:36,626 --> 00:15:37,959
Well I better be off now.

91
00:15:52,168 --> 00:15:54,918
They say that curtain
material's going up, you know?

92
00:15:57,709 --> 00:15:59,583
Well you could save
yourself 12 or 13 shillings

93
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:00,793
if you bought it now.

94
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:04,709
Ah.

95
00:16:07,918 --> 00:16:10,083
I ain't had no new curtains
since the missus died.

96
00:16:10,084 --> 00:16:12,000
But it's about time you did.

97
00:16:12,001 --> 00:16:13,834
You let me get 'em, I'll fix 'em up.

98
00:16:16,168 --> 00:16:17,833
All right you get 'em.

99
00:16:31,418 --> 00:16:33,084
Hello, Mr. Parker.

100
00:17:09,168 --> 00:17:11,042
I suppose I must owe you a bob or two.

101
00:17:11,043 --> 00:17:12,167
Soon as I get the hand done

102
00:17:12,168 --> 00:17:13,583
I'll settle up with you.

103
00:18:25,668 --> 00:18:27,084
Oh, Mr. Parker.

104
00:18:28,001 --> 00:18:31,667
You'll have to get yourself
some new shirts and underwear.

105
00:18:31,668 --> 00:18:33,834
I don't think these'll stand another wash.

106
00:18:34,918 --> 00:18:36,083
That'll be all right.

107
00:18:36,084 --> 00:18:38,084
That's good ventilation.

108
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:40,834
I shall need some soap.

109
00:18:42,251 --> 00:18:43,251
Ah.

110
00:19:11,001 --> 00:19:12,001
Dulce?

111
00:19:18,918 --> 00:19:20,584
Dulce, you up there?

112
00:20:45,959 --> 00:20:48,208
Hello, Mr. Parker.

113
00:20:48,209 --> 00:20:50,167
Isn't it hot today?

114
00:20:50,168 --> 00:20:52,626
Oh it's fair tired me
up walking up that hill.

115
00:20:53,751 --> 00:20:55,750
I'm sorry I couldn't come up yesterday.

116
00:20:55,751 --> 00:20:57,626
That's why I come up early today.

117
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:02,876
Oh, I gotta go and get myself a drink.

118
00:21:56,251 --> 00:21:57,501
Oh, Mr. Parker.

119
00:21:58,501 --> 00:21:59,625
Do you want something?

120
00:21:59,626 --> 00:22:01,625
No, love, no.

121
00:22:01,626 --> 00:22:03,458
Do you want a cup of tea?

122
00:22:03,459 --> 00:22:04,501
No, thanks, no, no.

123
00:22:07,251 --> 00:22:09,792
How about you coming up here for good?

124
00:22:09,793 --> 00:22:10,626
What?

125
00:22:10,627 --> 00:22:12,000
Yeah, that's right,

126
00:22:12,001 --> 00:22:14,293
like you know, keep house for me.

127
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:16,418
I couldn't!

128
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:18,833
But why not?

129
00:22:18,834 --> 00:22:19,834
Why not eh?

130
00:22:20,709 --> 00:22:22,917
I'm willing to pay.

131
00:22:22,918 --> 00:22:24,250
I've been meaning to ask
you for some time now.

132
00:22:24,251 --> 00:22:26,583
I'm very satisfied with the way you work.

133
00:22:26,584 --> 00:22:28,501
Yeah, I mean you like
it up here, don't you?

134
00:22:29,918 --> 00:22:31,625
It's not that.

135
00:22:31,626 --> 00:22:33,208
I just couldn't.

136
00:22:33,209 --> 00:22:34,250
Well why not?

137
00:22:34,251 --> 00:22:36,792
Why not, I'm willing to pay.

138
00:22:36,793 --> 00:22:39,001
I don't know, I mean what'll you pay?

139
00:22:40,501 --> 00:22:42,834
You keep saying you'll
pay but how do I know?

140
00:22:44,126 --> 00:22:45,583
Three pound ten a week and your keep,

141
00:22:45,584 --> 00:22:46,834
now how's that?

142
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:50,667
I could get more than that

143
00:22:50,668 --> 00:22:51,875
working down at the supermarket.

144
00:22:51,876 --> 00:22:53,208
Four pound.

145
00:22:53,209 --> 00:22:54,250
And I wouldn't have to traipse

146
00:22:54,251 --> 00:22:55,251
all the way up here.

147
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:59,083
Anyway, you keep saying you'll pay me,

148
00:22:59,084 --> 00:23:01,958
but there's all that
what you owe me already.

149
00:23:01,959 --> 00:23:03,250
Oh!

150
00:23:03,251 --> 00:23:06,667
You didn't think I was gonna
forget that, Dulce, did you eh?

151
00:23:06,668 --> 00:23:07,833
Tell you no,

152
00:23:07,834 --> 00:23:10,417
you didn't think I was
gonna forget to pay?

153
00:23:10,418 --> 00:23:12,667
No, I've been a bit busy.

154
00:23:12,668 --> 00:23:14,583
I know you'll pay, Mr. Parker.

155
00:23:14,584 --> 00:23:15,875
Yeah.

156
00:23:15,876 --> 00:23:17,083
Well that's right then innit, eh?

157
00:23:17,084 --> 00:23:19,168
And the three pound 10 a week you,

158
00:23:20,126 --> 00:23:22,458
four pound a week and your keep.

159
00:23:22,459 --> 00:23:23,792
I don't know.

160
00:23:23,793 --> 00:23:25,500
I'll have to think about it.

161
00:23:25,501 --> 00:23:27,583
'Cause there's other people
I got to think about.

162
00:23:27,584 --> 00:23:28,667
Other things.

163
00:23:28,668 --> 00:23:29,958
Ah.

164
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:31,417
Yeah, right, right.

165
00:23:31,418 --> 00:23:32,918
You think think about it.

166
00:23:49,168 --> 00:23:51,125
How much longer
you gonna sit there?

167
00:23:51,126 --> 00:23:53,167
I can't sleep with the light on.

168
00:23:53,168 --> 00:23:55,042
I just got this
bit and ending to finish.

169
00:23:55,043 --> 00:23:56,833
You shouldn't have to
sit up all hours doing that.

170
00:23:56,834 --> 00:23:58,167
Why can't Dulce do it?

171
00:23:58,168 --> 00:23:59,292
She's got enough to do as it is.

172
00:23:59,293 --> 00:24:01,208
Don't you think she works hard enough?

173
00:24:01,209 --> 00:24:03,292
Yeah but clackers,
this is her place here

174
00:24:03,293 --> 00:24:04,293
working in this house.

175
00:24:04,293 --> 00:24:05,251
- Dad--
- Yeah but clackers.

176
00:24:05,252 --> 00:24:07,250
Anyway you don't pay her for it.

177
00:24:07,251 --> 00:24:08,084
Pay her?

178
00:24:08,085 --> 00:24:09,292
No you hear when I said

179
00:24:09,293 --> 00:24:10,333
- put the light out!
- Don't make so much noise,

180
00:24:10,334 --> 00:24:12,208
you'll wake the children.

181
00:24:12,209 --> 00:24:17,209
Put the light out!

182
00:24:18,418 --> 00:24:19,418
Dulce?

183
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:23,000
You think about what I said?

184
00:24:23,001 --> 00:24:23,834
A bit.

185
00:24:23,835 --> 00:24:25,083
Ah, that'll be all right then eh?

186
00:24:25,084 --> 00:24:27,542
I mean it ain't bad up here is it, eh?

187
00:24:27,543 --> 00:24:29,500
You like it here, don't you?

188
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:32,917
Yeah but what am I gonna
do with myself all day?

189
00:24:32,918 --> 00:24:34,208
There's nobody to talk to.

190
00:24:34,209 --> 00:24:36,417
There's nobody up here.

191
00:24:36,418 --> 00:24:40,042
Well I'll take you to
town Saturdays, market days.

192
00:24:40,043 --> 00:24:41,250
There's no need to be lonely.

193
00:24:41,251 --> 00:24:42,251
It ain't that.

194
00:24:43,376 --> 00:24:45,126
It ain't only what I think.

195
00:24:46,334 --> 00:24:47,792
Well who else is it then?

196
00:24:47,793 --> 00:24:49,042
Is it your dad?

197
00:24:49,043 --> 00:24:50,292
I don't care what he thinks.

198
00:24:50,293 --> 00:24:51,917
I don't care about him.

199
00:24:51,918 --> 00:24:52,918
Who else then?

200
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:57,083
Well there is somebody else.

201
00:24:57,084 --> 00:24:58,417
Well who, who?

202
00:24:58,418 --> 00:24:59,709
My boyfriend.

203
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:01,875
My young man.

204
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:02,876
Boyfriend?

205
00:25:04,584 --> 00:25:06,668
Well I never knew you had one.

206
00:25:09,168 --> 00:25:10,583
Well who is he?

207
00:25:10,584 --> 00:25:11,834
What's his name?

208
00:25:16,001 --> 00:25:17,001
Albert.

209
00:25:18,334 --> 00:25:19,334
Albert.

210
00:25:20,626 --> 00:25:21,917
Well you don't think he'd like it?

211
00:25:21,918 --> 00:25:23,708
It ain't only that.

212
00:25:23,709 --> 00:25:25,417
He gives me money.

213
00:25:25,418 --> 00:25:28,125
You know, a few shillings
saving every week

214
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:29,375
so we can get things ready,

215
00:25:29,376 --> 00:25:30,625
so we can get married someday.

216
00:25:30,626 --> 00:25:31,626
Marry?

217
00:25:32,293 --> 00:25:33,708
You're gonna get married?

218
00:25:33,709 --> 00:25:35,043
Well I hope so.

219
00:25:37,376 --> 00:25:38,334
Four pound 10 a week.

220
00:25:38,335 --> 00:25:41,500
Now if I give you that, will you come?

221
00:25:41,501 --> 00:25:42,834
I'll ask Albert tonight.

222
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:45,918
I should think he'll probably murder me.

223
00:25:51,168 --> 00:25:53,376
I'll stomp you
if I get hold of you.

224
00:26:06,459 --> 00:26:08,709
You stupid useless bitch.

225
00:26:16,001 --> 00:26:18,542
I hope we don't bump into Albert.

226
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:22,083
I had to tell him all kinds of
tales about you, Mr. Parker.

227
00:26:22,084 --> 00:26:23,667
Ah.

228
00:26:23,668 --> 00:26:25,000
Well what'd he say?

229
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:26,667
Well he said I could give it a trial.

230
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,500
He said I could come up here for a week.

231
00:26:28,501 --> 00:26:29,958
Ah.

232
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:30,793
What else?

233
00:26:30,794 --> 00:26:32,917
Oh he was a bit jealous.

234
00:26:32,918 --> 00:26:34,667
But I said it would be all right.

235
00:26:34,668 --> 00:26:36,625
Well never you mind about Albert.

236
00:26:36,626 --> 00:26:37,833
Now you keep along with me.

237
00:26:37,834 --> 00:26:41,333
I got a few fly deals on today.

238
00:26:41,334 --> 00:26:42,334
Oh.

239
00:26:58,918 --> 00:26:59,751
Right then, here we go.

240
00:26:59,752 --> 00:27:01,667
Lot one, four nice Friesians,

241
00:27:01,668 --> 00:27:03,292
the property of Mr. Bamberg.

242
00:27:03,293 --> 00:27:04,708
What can I see for 'em?

243
00:27:04,709 --> 00:27:06,417
Who's got me a 40?

244
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:08,542
Well a 35 then, 35, thank you sir.

245
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:11,167
35, 35, 36.

246
00:27:11,168 --> 00:27:13,750
37, a 38, a 38, a 39, thank you sir.

247
00:27:13,751 --> 00:27:16,000
Waiting, 40, 41, a 41.

248
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:17,584
A 42, 43, a 44.

249
00:27:18,501 --> 00:27:21,833
45, 45, 46, 46.

250
00:27:21,834 --> 00:27:24,083
A 47, thank you, a 47.

251
00:27:24,084 --> 00:27:25,209
A 48, 48, 48.

252
00:27:26,293 --> 00:27:27,293
49, 49, 49.

253
00:27:28,251 --> 00:27:29,291
A 50, a 50, thank you sir.

254
00:27:30,168 --> 00:27:31,333
50, 51.

255
00:27:31,334 --> 00:27:33,125
Mr. Parker.

256
00:27:33,126 --> 00:27:34,542
Who's doing the bidding?

257
00:27:34,543 --> 00:27:36,292
I mean how does he know?

258
00:27:36,293 --> 00:27:38,126
Ah, he knows all right.

259
00:27:40,001 --> 00:27:41,418
See that man smoking a pipe?

260
00:27:43,043 --> 00:27:43,959
That's a bid.

261
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,917
See that man over there
scratching his nose

262
00:27:45,918 --> 00:27:47,542
with a stick?

263
00:27:47,543 --> 00:27:48,793
That's another.

264
00:27:51,418 --> 00:27:54,375
Him there flicking his thumb.

265
00:27:54,376 --> 00:27:56,167
That's a bid.

266
00:27:56,168 --> 00:27:58,083
Old Charlie Sawkins there,

267
00:27:58,084 --> 00:28:00,293
changing his stick from
one hand to another.

268
00:28:01,376 --> 00:28:02,667
Don't you move your hand about

269
00:28:02,668 --> 00:28:03,668
or it'll be knocked down to you.

270
00:28:03,668 --> 00:28:04,626
If you're all done,

271
00:28:04,627 --> 00:28:06,501
have a nice sale to Mr. Reeves.

272
00:28:08,584 --> 00:28:09,709
Come along with me.

273
00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:30,375
Hello, Symes.

274
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:31,251
What's on today?

275
00:28:31,252 --> 00:28:32,834
What you got?

276
00:28:33,751 --> 00:28:35,542
Four Galloways.

277
00:28:35,543 --> 00:28:36,917
Good 'uns?

278
00:28:36,918 --> 00:28:37,918
Fair.

279
00:28:38,709 --> 00:28:40,708
Another bloke's got Galloways.

280
00:28:40,709 --> 00:28:41,709
Good 'uns.

281
00:28:42,918 --> 00:28:44,208
When is his lot up?

282
00:28:44,209 --> 00:28:46,333
Oh, about half an hour or so.

283
00:28:46,334 --> 00:28:48,833
Reckon the bidding should be tasty.

284
00:28:48,834 --> 00:28:51,625
Apart from your own,
there's no other Galloways.

285
00:28:51,626 --> 00:28:52,626
Ah.

286
00:28:54,501 --> 00:28:55,668
I better take a look.

287
00:28:57,918 --> 00:28:58,918
Come along with me.

288
00:29:07,418 --> 00:29:08,625
They your own?

289
00:29:08,626 --> 00:29:10,000
That's right.

290
00:29:10,001 --> 00:29:12,417
Ah well I like 'em.

291
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:14,250
How much will you take for 'em?

292
00:29:14,251 --> 00:29:15,168
Well they're up for auction.

293
00:29:15,169 --> 00:29:17,208
Well you can sell them
prior to an auction.

294
00:29:17,209 --> 00:29:18,542
You've been here before?

295
00:29:18,543 --> 00:29:19,583
Couple of times.

296
00:29:19,584 --> 00:29:20,875
I used to go to Rolie market.

297
00:29:20,876 --> 00:29:23,292
Well, like anywhere else, you
can sell them as you please.

298
00:29:23,293 --> 00:29:24,918
How much would you take for 'em?

299
00:29:26,293 --> 00:29:28,375
I reckon they'd pull in 60 pound apiece.

300
00:29:28,376 --> 00:29:30,501
Good strain, see for yourself.

301
00:29:31,793 --> 00:29:34,209
I'm in a hurry, I'll
give you 60 pound apiece.

302
00:29:35,293 --> 00:29:36,126
Well.

303
00:29:36,127 --> 00:29:37,527
Take it or leave it.

304
00:29:39,293 --> 00:29:41,000
I'll take it, Mister?

305
00:29:41,001 --> 00:29:41,959
Parker.

306
00:29:41,959 --> 00:29:42,793
Harris.

307
00:29:42,793 --> 00:29:43,709
It's a deal.

308
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:46,375
You know that popup on the hill there?

309
00:29:46,376 --> 00:29:47,958
Where, up there?

310
00:29:47,959 --> 00:29:49,125
Yeah, that's right.

311
00:29:49,126 --> 00:29:50,208
Now you wait for me there,

312
00:29:50,209 --> 00:29:52,500
I'll be along with my
partner in half an hour.

313
00:29:52,501 --> 00:29:54,000
I'll give you cash.

314
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:55,042
You want cash?

315
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:55,876
That'll be fine.

316
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:56,917
I'll see you there.

317
00:29:56,918 --> 00:29:57,751
Thank you.

318
00:29:57,752 --> 00:29:58,918
Come along with me.

319
00:30:07,626 --> 00:30:09,875
All right, let's try
and sell these, shall we?

320
00:30:09,876 --> 00:30:10,709
Lot E.

321
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,583
Four nice Shirley cross Galloways,

322
00:30:12,584 --> 00:30:13,875
the property of Mr. Parker.

323
00:30:13,876 --> 00:30:15,667
These hefers, the only ones today

324
00:30:15,668 --> 00:30:17,917
due to the last minute
withdrawal of the other lot,

325
00:30:17,918 --> 00:30:20,292
are as you can see our superior stock.

326
00:30:20,293 --> 00:30:22,125
Now what can I say for 'em?

327
00:30:22,126 --> 00:30:23,208
70 apiece?

328
00:30:23,209 --> 00:30:25,625
65 then?

329
00:30:25,626 --> 00:30:26,626
60.

330
00:30:28,168 --> 00:30:29,168
Thank you sir.

331
00:30:29,169 --> 00:30:30,708
60 pounds on bid.

332
00:30:30,709 --> 00:30:31,709
61, 62?

333
00:30:33,001 --> 00:30:35,458
62, a 63, a 63?

334
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:38,000
64, thank you sir, a 64.

335
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:39,584
65, 65, 65, 65, 65.

336
00:30:41,543 --> 00:30:42,376
A 66, thank you sir.

337
00:30:42,377 --> 00:30:45,000
66, waiting, waiting, a 66.

338
00:30:45,001 --> 00:30:46,750
66, 66, 66.

339
00:30:46,751 --> 00:30:48,833
67, 67, 67.

340
00:30:48,834 --> 00:30:51,292
A 68, a 68, a 68

341
00:30:51,293 --> 00:30:53,125
and a 69, a 69.

342
00:30:53,126 --> 00:30:54,333
One thing for you.

343
00:30:54,334 --> 00:30:56,333
Stick with it, sir.

344
00:30:56,334 --> 00:30:57,417
A 69.

345
00:30:57,418 --> 00:30:58,251
A 69 if you're all done.

346
00:30:58,251 --> 00:30:59,209
Stick your hand up.

347
00:30:59,209 --> 00:31:00,043
Anyway if you're all done.

348
00:31:00,043 --> 00:31:00,876
What me?

349
00:31:00,876 --> 00:31:01,709
Come on, stick your hand up.

350
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,000
No, I can't, Mr. Parker.

351
00:31:03,001 --> 00:31:04,333
69.

352
00:31:04,334 --> 00:31:05,875
A 70, a 70.

353
00:31:05,876 --> 00:31:07,333
70 have you, a 71.

354
00:31:07,334 --> 00:31:08,833
71, 71.

355
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:10,251
A 72, a 72, a 72.

356
00:31:11,293 --> 00:31:12,126
If you're all done.

357
00:31:12,127 --> 00:31:14,959
Last time now sell at 72 to Mr. Blake.

358
00:31:16,126 --> 00:31:19,001
I told you I had a few
fly ideas on the day.

359
00:31:20,668 --> 00:31:22,333
Come along with me.

360
00:31:22,334 --> 00:31:25,000
That's a jolly good price
I'm paying you, Mr. Parker.

361
00:31:25,001 --> 00:31:26,751
They're worth more than that.

362
00:31:29,293 --> 00:31:30,668
I don't want no checks.

363
00:31:33,209 --> 00:31:35,958
I don't go about with
300 pounds on me, you know?

364
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:36,793
I don't want no checks.

365
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:37,918
Make it out to cash.

366
00:31:39,543 --> 00:31:40,958
I'll give you your cut later.

367
00:31:40,959 --> 00:31:42,833
Well, why don't you make
it out to us, Mr. Blake?

368
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:45,083
And then I can give Mr.
Parker here the money.

369
00:31:45,084 --> 00:31:47,250
And deduct our commission
at the same time.

370
00:31:47,251 --> 00:31:49,417
How does that suit you, Mr. Parker?

371
00:31:49,418 --> 00:31:50,418
Right.

372
00:31:58,543 --> 00:32:00,168
283.15.

373
00:32:02,043 --> 00:32:03,668
273 pounds 12.

374
00:32:08,668 --> 00:32:09,793
Let you down?

375
00:32:10,751 --> 00:32:12,292
My partner won't give me the money.

376
00:32:12,293 --> 00:32:13,293
Won't give you the money?

377
00:32:13,294 --> 00:32:14,458
Gimme a pint.

378
00:32:14,459 --> 00:32:15,500
But we made a deal.

379
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:16,501
We'll have to break it.

380
00:32:16,502 --> 00:32:18,543
What do you say your name is?

381
00:32:19,376 --> 00:32:20,792
Mr. Parker.

382
00:32:20,793 --> 00:32:22,500
Look, Mr. Parker.

383
00:32:22,501 --> 00:32:25,042
You have put me through
considerable trouble.

384
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:27,208
I'm sorry, I can't help it, can I?

385
00:32:27,209 --> 00:32:29,000
My partner's let me down.

386
00:32:29,001 --> 00:32:31,751
I don't think you're as
sorry as you'd have me believe.

387
00:32:45,126 --> 00:32:46,209
Mr. Parker.

388
00:32:49,126 --> 00:32:50,126
I'm hungry.

389
00:32:52,001 --> 00:32:54,417
There's a cafe just a
few doors down the road.

390
00:32:54,418 --> 00:32:56,042
That's a nice place.

391
00:32:56,043 --> 00:32:57,043
Are you coming?

392
00:32:57,044 --> 00:32:58,458
Mm-mm.

393
00:32:58,459 --> 00:32:59,792
I'll be here.

394
00:32:59,793 --> 00:33:01,251
I only got three shillings.

395
00:33:03,626 --> 00:33:04,750
You can get a good feed down there

396
00:33:04,751 --> 00:33:06,583
for three shillings.

397
00:33:59,293 --> 00:34:00,293
Mr. Parker.

398
00:34:02,293 --> 00:34:03,834
I just seen Albert.

399
00:34:05,876 --> 00:34:07,959
I don't know whether he's seen me or not.

400
00:34:09,501 --> 00:34:11,418
But I'm scared of what he might do.

401
00:34:14,709 --> 00:34:15,833
We better get home.

402
00:34:15,834 --> 00:34:17,459
That's what I think.

403
00:34:18,501 --> 00:34:19,875
Right this way.

404
00:34:19,876 --> 00:34:20,876
All right.

405
00:34:33,626 --> 00:34:35,083
He lives right here, does he, Albert?

406
00:34:35,084 --> 00:34:36,625
Not too far from here.

407
00:34:36,626 --> 00:34:37,708
Ah.

408
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:38,793
Come on, Mr. Parker.

409
00:34:43,834 --> 00:34:45,667
What's his work?

410
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:47,251
Oh he's got a good job.

411
00:34:48,334 --> 00:34:49,625
Well what is it?

412
00:34:49,626 --> 00:34:51,750
Well he
works at a building site.

413
00:34:51,751 --> 00:34:53,000
Construction work.

414
00:34:53,001 --> 00:34:54,001
Ah.

415
00:34:54,834 --> 00:34:56,209
Well how long you known him?

416
00:34:57,126 --> 00:34:59,292
Oh, going on two years.

417
00:34:59,293 --> 00:35:01,833
Two years,
oh that's a long time.

418
00:35:01,834 --> 00:35:03,083
You get to know a person real well

419
00:35:03,084 --> 00:35:05,042
out of two years though.

420
00:35:05,043 --> 00:35:07,833
Yes, sometimes
a bit too well, Mr. Parker.

421
00:35:07,834 --> 00:35:09,125
Ah.

422
00:35:09,126 --> 00:35:09,959
Come on with me.

423
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,793
All right.

424
00:37:48,584 --> 00:37:50,042
Ah, there you are.

425
00:37:50,043 --> 00:37:51,709
Had a bit of a bath?

426
00:37:53,418 --> 00:37:55,625
I was wondering if you'd
care for a glass of beer

427
00:37:55,626 --> 00:37:56,708
in the front room?

428
00:37:56,709 --> 00:37:59,333
I was just off to bed, Mr. Parker.

429
00:37:59,334 --> 00:38:01,750
I'm fair worn out by everything today.

430
00:38:01,751 --> 00:38:02,584
Ah.

431
00:38:02,584 --> 00:38:03,584
Tomorrow night.

432
00:38:05,709 --> 00:38:07,167
Tomorrow night.

433
00:38:07,168 --> 00:38:08,250
Good night.

434
00:38:08,251 --> 00:38:09,251
Night.

435
00:39:06,209 --> 00:39:07,209
Albert.

436
00:39:11,918 --> 00:39:13,583
Miss Parker?

437
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:14,792
No.

438
00:39:14,793 --> 00:39:16,417
Oh, sorry.

439
00:39:16,418 --> 00:39:17,792
You must want Mr. Parker.

440
00:39:17,793 --> 00:39:19,375
I don't know where he is right now.

441
00:39:19,376 --> 00:39:20,750
Can I help?

442
00:39:20,751 --> 00:39:21,792
Please, my name's Ashby.

443
00:39:21,793 --> 00:39:24,042
I'm Mr. Morton's new gamekeeper.

444
00:39:24,043 --> 00:39:25,958
I have some young pheasants
that have a bad habit

445
00:39:25,959 --> 00:39:27,667
of straying onto your land.

446
00:39:27,668 --> 00:39:28,750
I wondered if it'll be all right

447
00:39:28,751 --> 00:39:31,168
for me to come and round
them up once in a while.

448
00:39:32,043 --> 00:39:34,583
You mean come on to Mr. Parker's land?

449
00:39:34,584 --> 00:39:36,000
Yes.

450
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:38,250
Oh, I don't know.

451
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:39,292
He's very funny like that.

452
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:41,500
He don't like strangers
prowling around his land.

453
00:39:41,501 --> 00:39:42,334
I know.

454
00:39:42,335 --> 00:39:44,167
Mr. Morton told me he'd had
a few bad words with him

455
00:39:44,168 --> 00:39:45,458
a couple of years ago.

456
00:39:45,459 --> 00:39:48,000
I wasn't sure if Mr. Parker had forgotten.

457
00:39:48,001 --> 00:39:50,751
He gave me explicit instructions
to ask first, you see.

458
00:39:54,126 --> 00:39:55,668
You let me ask him.

459
00:39:56,626 --> 00:39:58,542
'Cause he's very funny like that.

460
00:39:58,543 --> 00:40:00,667
Why he'd very likely blow your brains out.

461
00:40:00,668 --> 00:40:01,626
Really?

462
00:40:01,627 --> 00:40:03,750
Well I'll keep out of his way then.

463
00:40:03,751 --> 00:40:05,584
That's it, you keep out of his way.

464
00:40:08,793 --> 00:40:11,458
Right, well the
next time I see you, I'll ask.

465
00:40:11,459 --> 00:40:13,125
I see you quite often.

466
00:40:13,126 --> 00:40:14,126
You do, how?

467
00:40:15,168 --> 00:40:16,084
Oh around the farm.

468
00:40:16,085 --> 00:40:17,251
I live just over there.

469
00:40:18,793 --> 00:40:19,626
Where?

470
00:40:19,627 --> 00:40:21,000
In Compton Wood.

471
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:22,667
What, you live in that old house?

472
00:40:22,668 --> 00:40:23,626
You know it?

473
00:40:23,627 --> 00:40:25,167
Yeah.

474
00:40:25,168 --> 00:40:27,292
We used to play in it when we were kids.

475
00:40:27,293 --> 00:40:28,875
You must get ever so lonely.

476
00:40:28,876 --> 00:40:30,000
Not really.

477
00:40:30,001 --> 00:40:32,458
I have plenty to do of an evening.

478
00:40:32,459 --> 00:40:34,293
Anyway, I like being on my own.

479
00:40:36,418 --> 00:40:37,708
I'd better be off.

480
00:40:37,709 --> 00:40:40,000
Look, I'll ask Mr. Parker
about the pheasants

481
00:40:40,001 --> 00:40:41,208
to tell you later.

482
00:40:41,209 --> 00:40:42,209
Thank you.

483
00:40:43,126 --> 00:40:44,167
Goodbye.

484
00:40:44,168 --> 00:40:45,168
Bye.

485
00:42:49,459 --> 00:42:50,459
Dulce?

486
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,958
How many in your family down there?

487
00:42:52,959 --> 00:42:53,959
10.

488
00:42:54,959 --> 00:42:56,293
That's including Ma and Pa.

489
00:42:57,293 --> 00:42:58,251
Huh.

490
00:42:58,252 --> 00:43:00,168
That's a lot of mouths to feed, innit?

491
00:43:03,626 --> 00:43:06,334
Does Albert ever come to your house?

492
00:43:08,834 --> 00:43:09,834
Albert?

493
00:43:12,251 --> 00:43:13,084
Why'd you ask?

494
00:43:13,085 --> 00:43:15,042
Oh, no reason, no.

495
00:43:15,043 --> 00:43:18,125
Except I saw a stranger in
the hayfield this morning.

496
00:43:18,126 --> 00:43:19,708
He had a gun.

497
00:43:19,709 --> 00:43:20,709
A gun?

498
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:22,208
Yeah.

499
00:43:22,209 --> 00:43:25,000
Tall fellow, dark haired,

500
00:43:25,001 --> 00:43:27,750
brown jersey with a sort of pattern on it.

501
00:43:27,751 --> 00:43:28,751
Is that him?

502
00:43:30,626 --> 00:43:32,168
That sounds like him.

503
00:43:33,876 --> 00:43:35,751
Yeah, he's got a jersey like that.

504
00:43:38,293 --> 00:43:40,334
He's jealous of you, Mr. Parker.

505
00:43:41,834 --> 00:43:43,501
He's very jealous of you.

506
00:43:44,501 --> 00:43:45,708
Is he there now?

507
00:43:45,709 --> 00:43:46,958
No, no, no, no, no.

508
00:43:46,959 --> 00:43:48,917
He shot off when he saw me.

509
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:50,500
Yeah.

510
00:43:50,501 --> 00:43:52,168
Yeah, he shot off when he saw me.

511
00:44:26,376 --> 00:44:27,708
Ah.

512
00:44:27,709 --> 00:44:30,667
I was wondering where you was.

513
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,084
Hey, what's this?

514
00:44:33,126 --> 00:44:35,208
You aren't going anywhere's are you?

515
00:44:35,209 --> 00:44:36,209
Oh, I don't know.

516
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:37,417
I get worried.

517
00:44:37,418 --> 00:44:39,208
Worried, what about?

518
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:40,209
It's Albert.

519
00:44:41,293 --> 00:44:42,708
It's Albert.

520
00:44:42,709 --> 00:44:44,792
I mean when people start
prowling about with guns,

521
00:44:44,793 --> 00:44:47,167
it's time I went back home.

522
00:44:47,168 --> 00:44:49,167
No, no, no, don't do that, Dulce, no.

523
00:44:49,168 --> 00:44:51,458
For God's sake don't do that, no.

524
00:44:51,459 --> 00:44:52,750
You can't do that.

525
00:44:52,751 --> 00:44:54,417
I can if Albert says so.

526
00:44:54,418 --> 00:44:55,542
Dulce.

527
00:44:55,543 --> 00:44:57,083
Hey, Mr. Parker.

528
00:44:57,084 --> 00:44:58,667
I don't want you to go.

529
00:44:58,668 --> 00:45:01,667
Yeah, but when people start
prowling about with guns,

530
00:45:01,668 --> 00:45:04,208
besides, you haven't paid me yet.

531
00:45:04,209 --> 00:45:05,043
I know.

532
00:45:05,044 --> 00:45:06,417
I know, I'll pay you.

533
00:45:06,418 --> 00:45:07,251
You keep saying that.

534
00:45:07,252 --> 00:45:09,292
That's all I've heard
since I came up here.

535
00:45:09,293 --> 00:45:10,168
Well how much is it?

536
00:45:10,168 --> 00:45:11,001
Hey, for God's sake, now how much is it?

537
00:45:11,002 --> 00:45:12,333
How much is it Dulce, how much is it?

538
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:14,500
I don't know, I've got
it written down somewhere.

539
00:45:14,501 --> 00:45:15,501
Right.

540
00:45:29,418 --> 00:45:30,668
20 pounds 17.

541
00:45:33,334 --> 00:45:34,918
And about time too.

542
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:59,209
20 pounds 17 shillings.

543
00:46:04,251 --> 00:46:05,251
22 pounds.

544
00:46:16,501 --> 00:46:17,834
23 pounds five.

545
00:46:24,543 --> 00:46:25,543
Oh.

546
00:46:32,876 --> 00:46:34,000
Oh.

547
00:46:34,001 --> 00:46:34,834
Oh, Dulce.

548
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:35,668
Hey.

549
00:46:35,669 --> 00:46:37,542
We won't get the money paid like this.

550
00:46:37,543 --> 00:46:39,417
I want you so bad, Dulce.

551
00:46:39,418 --> 00:46:41,500
I can't get on without you.

552
00:46:41,501 --> 00:46:42,334
I can't get on.

553
00:46:42,335 --> 00:46:43,917
Yeah, mind my dress.

554
00:46:43,918 --> 00:46:44,751
What?

555
00:46:44,752 --> 00:46:46,126
Well you're sitting on my dress.

556
00:46:49,501 --> 00:46:51,833
I thought you came to pay me the money.

557
00:46:51,834 --> 00:46:52,668
Hmm?

558
00:46:52,669 --> 00:46:53,958
Oh yeah, that's right.

559
00:46:53,959 --> 00:46:56,333
Yes I, I got it here.

560
00:46:56,334 --> 00:46:57,958
Well put it on the table then.

561
00:46:57,959 --> 00:46:58,793
Hmm?

562
00:46:58,794 --> 00:47:02,042
Go on.

563
00:47:02,043 --> 00:47:03,333
How much is it?

564
00:47:03,334 --> 00:47:04,334
40 pound.

565
00:47:07,793 --> 00:47:10,459
Well I bought a shilling or two.

566
00:47:11,459 --> 00:47:13,209
Put it in the drawer, it'd be safe there.

567
00:47:25,584 --> 00:47:27,208
Hey.

568
00:47:27,209 --> 00:47:28,626
How about Albert?

569
00:47:29,543 --> 00:47:31,709
You don't think I ever
wanted Albert, do you?

570
00:47:33,626 --> 00:47:35,126
Did Albert ever?

571
00:47:36,459 --> 00:47:38,709
Does it matter if he did?

572
00:47:43,459 --> 00:47:44,542
Oh!

573
00:47:44,543 --> 00:47:49,543
Oh, Mr. Parker.

574
00:48:18,626 --> 00:48:20,668
I'll give him 15 pounds.

575
00:49:36,084 --> 00:49:37,251
Mr. Parker?

576
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:40,584
Mr. Parker?

577
00:49:43,001 --> 00:49:43,834
Hmm?

578
00:49:43,835 --> 00:49:45,084
Your tea is ready.

579
00:49:51,668 --> 00:49:52,668
Ooh.

580
00:50:00,668 --> 00:50:02,834
That's the money you gave me.

581
00:50:03,793 --> 00:50:05,501
I did say 14, didn't I?

582
00:50:07,959 --> 00:50:09,876
Yeah, yeah, that's right yeah.

583
00:50:11,459 --> 00:50:13,542
Well you gave me too much.

584
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:15,542
You gave me 15.

585
00:50:15,543 --> 00:50:16,543
Oh.

586
00:50:17,418 --> 00:50:18,792
Did I?

587
00:50:18,793 --> 00:50:20,959
That means I gotta
give you a pound back.

588
00:50:21,876 --> 00:50:24,750
I mean we wanna keep
things right, don't we?

589
00:50:24,751 --> 00:50:25,833
No, no, no, no.

590
00:50:25,834 --> 00:50:27,458
You keep it, eh?

591
00:50:27,459 --> 00:50:28,833
Yeah.

592
00:50:28,834 --> 00:50:31,125
That's for a little extras.

593
00:50:31,126 --> 00:50:32,959
You like the little extras, do you?

594
00:50:39,918 --> 00:50:42,333
Oh, what are you doing to me?

595
00:50:42,334 --> 00:50:44,917
There's a time and place
for that sort of thing.

596
00:50:48,834 --> 00:50:50,417
No you don't!

597
00:50:50,418 --> 00:50:51,625
Oh no you don't!

598
00:50:51,626 --> 00:50:52,833
- Oh yeah.
- No.

599
00:50:52,834 --> 00:50:55,375
- It's my day!
- No, stop!

600
00:50:55,376 --> 00:50:57,708
Dulce, Dulce!

601
00:50:57,709 --> 00:50:59,167
Stop it!

602
00:50:59,168 --> 00:51:00,208
Hey!

603
00:51:14,751 --> 00:51:15,833
Oh!

604
00:51:15,834 --> 00:51:16,834
Oh no, no!

605
00:51:18,209 --> 00:51:19,209
Ah!

606
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,583
Mr. Parker, yoohoo!

607
00:51:29,584 --> 00:51:31,042
Wait, Dulce, come here!

608
00:51:31,043 --> 00:51:32,043
No!

609
00:51:45,543 --> 00:51:47,126
Yoohoo, Mr. Parker!

610
00:51:50,334 --> 00:51:51,584
Oh, Mr. Parker!

611
00:52:07,168 --> 00:52:08,584
Ah, I seen you!

612
00:52:19,709 --> 00:52:24,083
Oh, Mr. Parker!

613
00:52:24,084 --> 00:52:25,292
Banks?

614
00:52:25,293 --> 00:52:27,708
No, you don't want to have
nothing to do with banks.

615
00:52:27,709 --> 00:52:29,043
Banks ain't no good.

616
00:52:30,001 --> 00:52:30,959
No?

617
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,583
No, no, they know all your business.

618
00:52:32,584 --> 00:52:34,833
They get to know too much.

619
00:52:34,834 --> 00:52:37,000
Then the income tax get to know.

620
00:52:37,001 --> 00:52:38,375
I ain't paying no bleeding tax,

621
00:52:38,376 --> 00:52:39,833
not if I know it.

622
00:52:39,834 --> 00:52:41,917
No, they ain't getting
nothing away from me.

623
00:52:41,918 --> 00:52:43,333
Well I'll put it in
the post office then,

624
00:52:43,334 --> 00:52:44,792
I'll get interest on it.

625
00:52:44,793 --> 00:52:47,042
No, you don't want
to do nothing with it.

626
00:52:47,043 --> 00:52:48,833
No, you keep it.

627
00:52:48,834 --> 00:52:51,500
Keep it where nobody can't
touch it, that's all.

628
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:52,793
Well I'll have to see.

629
00:52:54,584 --> 00:52:55,833
I forgot.

630
00:52:55,834 --> 00:52:57,542
Albert came around again today.

631
00:52:57,543 --> 00:52:58,750
Albert?

632
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:00,208
Well what does he want with you now?

633
00:53:00,209 --> 00:53:01,792
I don't know.

634
00:53:01,793 --> 00:53:03,875
I can't think why he won't leave us alone.

635
00:53:03,876 --> 00:53:04,709
I told him.

636
00:53:04,709 --> 00:53:05,543
Told him?

637
00:53:05,543 --> 00:53:06,376
Told him what?

638
00:53:06,376 --> 00:53:07,376
I told him about us.

639
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:10,333
About how we were.

640
00:53:10,334 --> 00:53:13,250
About us being on our own
and all that, it's over.

641
00:53:13,251 --> 00:53:14,084
Cool.

642
00:53:14,085 --> 00:53:16,125
Oh cool, Dulce.

643
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:17,250
Oh cool.

644
00:53:17,251 --> 00:53:19,375
Oh Mr. Parker,
what are you doing to me,

645
00:53:19,376 --> 00:53:24,376
that tickles!

646
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:17,168
Hello.

647
00:54:20,418 --> 00:54:21,418
What's that?

648
00:54:22,251 --> 00:54:25,251
Oh it's a polecat with
a bit of ferret in him.

649
00:54:26,168 --> 00:54:28,001
There's something wrong with his leg.

650
00:54:28,876 --> 00:54:30,208
Oh I suppose you'll have to kill it.

651
00:54:30,209 --> 00:54:31,750
No, I'll put a cast on it.

652
00:54:31,751 --> 00:54:33,208
He'll be all right in a
couple of weeks or so.

653
00:54:33,209 --> 00:54:35,333
Oh I didn't know you was a vet.

654
00:54:35,334 --> 00:54:37,625
I'm not, but
I used to work for one.

655
00:54:37,626 --> 00:54:39,375
Poor little thing.

656
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:40,376
What a shame.

657
00:54:42,001 --> 00:54:44,709
Did you speak to Mr. Parker
about the pheasants yet?

658
00:54:45,918 --> 00:54:47,501
Well I did mention it to him.

659
00:54:48,668 --> 00:54:50,543
He didn't like the idea very much

660
00:54:51,543 --> 00:54:53,417
but he said it would be all right

661
00:54:53,418 --> 00:54:55,625
as long as he didn't see you.

662
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:57,042
I see.

663
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:59,500
Oh it's not you he don't like.

664
00:54:59,501 --> 00:55:00,543
It's Mr. Morton.

665
00:55:01,834 --> 00:55:03,333
But as long as he doesn't see you

666
00:55:03,334 --> 00:55:04,750
it'll be all right.

667
00:55:04,751 --> 00:55:06,125
Right, thank you.

668
00:55:06,126 --> 00:55:07,293
Well I better be off.

669
00:55:09,834 --> 00:55:10,875
Bye.

670
00:55:10,876 --> 00:55:12,583
I hope the polecat gets better.

671
00:55:12,584 --> 00:55:13,584
Thank you.

672
00:55:27,168 --> 00:55:28,043
Morning.

673
00:55:28,044 --> 00:55:29,709
Hello, Mr. Parker.

674
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:39,126
Ah, cha!

675
00:56:12,918 --> 00:56:15,667
Hey Dulce, hey what's this?

676
00:56:15,668 --> 00:56:16,958
What's up now?

677
00:56:16,959 --> 00:56:19,043
I can't find that money you gave me.

678
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:22,043
Well you must have mislaid it somewhere.

679
00:56:23,126 --> 00:56:24,833
I've looked high and low.

680
00:56:24,834 --> 00:56:27,251
Well when did you last see it?

681
00:56:29,001 --> 00:56:31,292
That day when Albert
came prowling about.

682
00:56:31,293 --> 00:56:32,958
Albert.

683
00:56:32,959 --> 00:56:34,250
We got to put a stop to this.

684
00:56:34,251 --> 00:56:37,500
I'll get the police onto him!

685
00:56:37,501 --> 00:56:39,583
Oh no, don't do that.

686
00:56:39,584 --> 00:56:42,501
We don't want no trouble.

687
00:56:44,126 --> 00:56:46,625
Now, now, don't cry
Dulce, don't cry, don't cry.

688
00:56:46,626 --> 00:56:49,875
That won't do no good, won't do no good.

689
00:56:49,876 --> 00:56:51,625
Yeah but what have I got now,

690
00:56:51,626 --> 00:56:53,417
I ain't got nothing.

691
00:56:53,418 --> 00:56:56,209
I paid all that out for the
hours and now it's gone!

692
00:56:57,126 --> 00:56:58,333
All right, I'll make it up to you.

693
00:56:58,334 --> 00:57:03,001
I'll make it up, I'll make
it right, I'll make it right.

694
00:57:07,459 --> 00:57:08,459
Oh.

695
00:57:10,793 --> 00:57:11,918
I made a mistake.

696
00:57:13,418 --> 00:57:14,793
I added it up wrong.

697
00:57:16,418 --> 00:57:17,667
You put me off that night

698
00:57:17,668 --> 00:57:19,418
when you came into the bedroom.

699
00:57:21,126 --> 00:57:23,626
It's 24 pounds 10 to me, right?

700
00:57:30,959 --> 00:57:33,001
Well it's only a little bit extra.

701
00:57:33,876 --> 00:57:34,876
It ain't much.

702
00:57:36,001 --> 00:57:37,500
You can't have all the little extras

703
00:57:37,501 --> 00:57:38,834
for nothing, can you?

704
00:58:07,543 --> 00:58:08,543
Ooh.

705
00:58:08,544 --> 00:58:09,876
Mmm!

706
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:14,083
I like the way you've
had your hair styled.

707
01:01:14,084 --> 01:01:15,542
Do you?

708
01:01:15,543 --> 01:01:16,543
Yes.

709
01:01:17,418 --> 01:01:19,708
It's about time I had it done.

710
01:01:19,709 --> 01:01:21,168
Oh, it's very becoming.

711
01:01:26,959 --> 01:01:29,500
I don't think you can carry any more.

712
01:01:29,501 --> 01:01:30,334
Are you sure you can manage?

713
01:01:30,334 --> 01:01:31,334
Yes.

714
01:01:32,501 --> 01:01:34,208
I'll carry them up the
house for you if you like.

715
01:01:34,209 --> 01:01:35,333
Oh no, don't bother.

716
01:01:35,334 --> 01:01:36,376
I can manage.

717
01:01:38,084 --> 01:01:39,875
Don't you want none for yourself?

718
01:01:39,876 --> 01:01:41,708
Oh they grow all around my house.

719
01:01:41,709 --> 01:01:43,959
I just can't imagine
you living up there.

720
01:01:45,126 --> 01:01:46,333
I can't imagine it.

721
01:01:46,334 --> 01:01:47,543
You should see it now.

722
01:01:48,709 --> 01:01:50,750
I'd like to.

723
01:01:50,751 --> 01:01:52,458
Anytime you like.

724
01:01:52,459 --> 01:01:53,543
I'll make tea for you.

725
01:01:55,793 --> 01:01:58,042
I will then, thank you.

726
01:01:58,043 --> 01:01:59,125
Goodbye.

727
01:01:59,126 --> 01:02:00,126
Goodbye.

728
01:02:13,501 --> 01:02:14,583
That you Dulce?

729
01:02:14,584 --> 01:02:15,708
Yes.

730
01:02:15,709 --> 01:02:17,501
Where you been all this?

731
01:02:21,959 --> 01:02:22,959
Oh my God.

732
01:02:27,501 --> 01:02:30,500
Hah, what you done all that for?

733
01:02:30,501 --> 01:02:33,083
I had my hair done, that's all.

734
01:02:33,084 --> 01:02:34,084
Ah.

735
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:37,458
Yeah I like it, yeah.

736
01:02:37,459 --> 01:02:39,500
It makes you look different but

737
01:02:39,501 --> 01:02:40,875
yeah I like it.

738
01:02:40,876 --> 01:02:42,084
But what made you do it?

739
01:02:43,668 --> 01:02:45,708
I had it done with
that money you gave me.

740
01:02:45,709 --> 01:02:46,709
Sure, oh.

741
01:02:48,668 --> 01:02:51,542
God, what a sight for sore eyes, eh?

742
01:02:51,543 --> 01:02:52,792
Cool.

743
01:02:52,793 --> 01:02:54,167
You look good, Dulce.

744
01:02:54,168 --> 01:02:57,542
You put some new pictures up?

745
01:02:57,543 --> 01:02:58,376
What?

746
01:02:58,376 --> 01:02:59,209
No, no, no they're old ones.

747
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:00,792
I'd come across some
old things in the shed.

748
01:03:00,793 --> 01:03:03,375
I thought they might
look good up there, huh?

749
01:03:03,376 --> 01:03:04,417
Did you like 'em?

750
01:03:04,418 --> 01:03:06,958
Yes.

751
01:03:06,959 --> 01:03:08,709
I've been thinking now.

752
01:03:09,584 --> 01:03:11,250
I reckon the place could do with

753
01:03:11,251 --> 01:03:12,792
an extra set of furniture

754
01:03:12,793 --> 01:03:15,125
specially after you fixed it up so good.

755
01:03:15,126 --> 01:03:17,708
Yeah, pictures and flowers
will make the place

756
01:03:17,709 --> 01:03:18,918
sort of homely.

757
01:03:20,501 --> 01:03:24,583
Course, I could go for a television.

758
01:03:24,584 --> 01:03:25,708
Eh Dulce, eh?

759
01:03:25,709 --> 01:03:27,708
Watch the television huh?

760
01:03:27,709 --> 01:03:28,958
How about it?

761
01:03:28,959 --> 01:03:30,583
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

762
01:03:30,584 --> 01:03:33,001
Yeah, don't cost nothing
now that you bought it.

763
01:03:34,001 --> 01:03:38,126
I've been doing quite a
bit of thinking lately.

764
01:03:39,001 --> 01:03:44,001
I mean, you know how people are,

765
01:03:44,168 --> 01:03:45,917
they start talking.

766
01:03:45,918 --> 01:03:48,209
Well, I reckon,

767
01:03:50,376 --> 01:03:52,043
reckon you and I all get married.

768
01:03:53,543 --> 01:03:54,625
Eh Dulce, eh?

769
01:03:54,626 --> 01:03:55,876
Eh, get married.

770
01:03:56,793 --> 01:03:58,459
How about it, Dulce?

771
01:04:00,709 --> 01:04:02,583
I don't know.

772
01:04:02,584 --> 01:04:04,417
I'll have to think about it.

773
01:04:04,418 --> 01:04:06,250
Well what's there to think about, eh?

774
01:04:06,251 --> 01:04:08,584
You know me, you enjoy the place.

775
01:04:09,751 --> 01:04:12,626
Hey, it ain't Albert, is it?

776
01:04:13,668 --> 01:04:14,834
Good heavens, no.

777
01:04:16,918 --> 01:04:18,293
I mean I'd like to.

778
01:04:19,376 --> 01:04:20,376
I wouldn't mind.

779
01:04:22,376 --> 01:04:24,208
But I'll have to think about it.

780
01:04:24,209 --> 01:04:25,209
Ah.

781
01:04:26,376 --> 01:04:28,834
Of course, you might have to marry me.

782
01:04:29,793 --> 01:04:31,167
Well I wouldn't mind that.

783
01:04:31,168 --> 01:04:33,000
I should think not.

784
01:04:33,001 --> 01:04:35,875
I'm the one that should worry
about a thing like that.

785
01:04:35,876 --> 01:04:36,876
Ah.

786
01:04:38,668 --> 01:04:40,000
Let me think it over.

787
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:42,750
All right, all right, you think it over.

788
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:44,583
I'll put a few more of these pictures up.

789
01:04:44,584 --> 01:04:46,292
Yeah, that'll look nice.

790
01:04:46,293 --> 01:04:47,293
All right.

791
01:04:52,959 --> 01:04:55,458
Hello Mr. Smith, how's things with you?

792
01:04:55,459 --> 01:04:56,376
Oh, can't complain.

793
01:04:56,376 --> 01:04:57,209
That's right.

794
01:04:57,210 --> 01:04:58,376
Too nice a day to complain.

795
01:05:10,293 --> 01:05:11,833
You sure, Mr. Parker?

796
01:05:11,834 --> 01:05:13,459
Yes, right, two sacks will do.

797
01:05:14,668 --> 01:05:15,875
That's three pounds 10 please sir.

798
01:05:15,876 --> 01:05:17,667
Here's four pounds, keep the change.

799
01:05:17,668 --> 01:05:18,501
Thanks very much,

800
01:05:18,501 --> 01:05:19,376
- Mr. Parker.
- Thanks Mr. Parker.

801
01:05:19,377 --> 01:05:20,542
Will that be your truck here?

802
01:05:20,543 --> 01:05:24,209
Yeah
that's right over there.

803
01:06:26,834 --> 01:06:27,834
Hello?

804
01:06:32,793 --> 01:06:33,793
Hello?

805
01:07:23,418 --> 01:07:25,958
Hello.

806
01:07:25,959 --> 01:07:28,000
I hope you didn't mind me coming in.

807
01:07:28,001 --> 01:07:29,833
The door was open.

808
01:07:29,834 --> 01:07:31,500
You did ask me.

809
01:07:31,501 --> 01:07:33,250
No, I'm glad you're here.

810
01:07:33,251 --> 01:07:34,251
Sit down.

811
01:07:40,876 --> 01:07:42,750
How about a cup of tea?

812
01:07:42,751 --> 01:07:43,751
Thank you.

813
01:07:49,209 --> 01:07:52,750
You never told me your name.

814
01:07:52,751 --> 01:07:54,042
It's Dulcima.

815
01:07:54,043 --> 01:07:57,084
That's Dulcima Parker, isn't it?

816
01:07:58,334 --> 01:07:59,376
Dulcima Gaskain.

817
01:08:02,293 --> 01:08:05,458
- First I thought Mr.
- Parker was your father.

818
01:08:05,459 --> 01:08:07,376
What, him, my father?

819
01:08:09,376 --> 01:08:11,250
Oh no, I only housekeep for him.

820
01:08:11,251 --> 01:08:12,667
Oh I see.

821
01:08:12,668 --> 01:08:14,417
Do you stay up there?

822
01:08:14,418 --> 01:08:16,293
Not likely, no.

823
01:08:17,709 --> 01:08:18,918
I go up every night.

824
01:08:21,876 --> 01:08:23,709
I couldn't face living up there.

825
01:08:24,793 --> 01:08:27,626
I mean, there's nobody to talk to,

826
01:08:28,793 --> 01:08:29,793
nobody to see.

827
01:08:33,376 --> 01:08:34,293
Do you live in the village?

828
01:08:34,294 --> 01:08:35,334
No, Bristol.

829
01:08:36,376 --> 01:08:38,458
Oh, that's a long way off.

830
01:08:38,459 --> 01:08:40,083
I like it here, though.

831
01:08:40,084 --> 01:08:41,084
I like the life.

832
01:08:42,084 --> 01:08:45,458
My father wanted me to go
into the family business

833
01:08:45,459 --> 01:08:47,250
along with my brothers.

834
01:08:47,251 --> 01:08:49,418
But I wanted to be a vet so I left.

835
01:08:50,834 --> 01:08:52,793
I suppose I've cut myself off a bit but

836
01:08:53,668 --> 01:08:55,958
at least I'm free to do what I want.

837
01:08:55,959 --> 01:08:57,750
And I can talk to people
who are interested

838
01:08:57,751 --> 01:08:59,126
in the same things as me.

839
01:09:01,293 --> 01:09:02,293
How's you're tea?

840
01:09:08,334 --> 01:09:09,917
It's nice.

841
01:09:18,751 --> 01:09:20,292
45, 46?

842
01:09:20,293 --> 01:09:22,209
47, 47, come along now.

843
01:09:23,376 --> 01:09:24,876
47, 48, thank you.

844
01:09:26,293 --> 01:09:27,709
48, 48, you done?

845
01:09:28,709 --> 01:09:30,917
48, 48, and 48, are you done?

846
01:09:30,918 --> 01:09:32,250
49, thank you sir.

847
01:09:32,251 --> 01:09:33,501
49, 49, 49, 49.

848
01:09:35,793 --> 01:09:36,626
50, thank you.

849
01:09:36,626 --> 01:09:37,626
50, 50, 51.

850
01:09:38,959 --> 01:09:39,959
52, 52.

851
01:10:19,334 --> 01:10:20,958
What a shot for Rangers

852
01:10:20,959 --> 01:10:22,583
and what a pity that it was out

853
01:10:22,584 --> 01:10:23,418
against Storm tactics.

854
01:10:23,419 --> 01:10:27,333
I told you I'd get us a television.

855
01:10:27,334 --> 01:10:28,751
It's good, innit?

856
01:10:31,793 --> 01:10:33,958
The Rangers worked hard

857
01:10:33,959 --> 01:10:35,250
to make up their deficit

858
01:10:35,251 --> 01:10:37,000
but Celtic were quick to clear

859
01:10:37,001 --> 01:10:38,251
and retaliate positively.

860
01:10:39,209 --> 01:10:40,625
Yeah.

861
01:10:40,626 --> 01:10:42,167
That's just what we need for the winter.

862
01:10:42,168 --> 01:10:43,833
I know winters are bad here,

863
01:10:43,834 --> 01:10:44,751
you couldn't get out of the place

864
01:10:44,752 --> 01:10:46,167
for a month or more.

865
01:10:46,168 --> 01:10:49,125
Hey, we can sit and watch the telly.

866
01:10:49,126 --> 01:10:50,126
Yeah.

867
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:57,126
Did you think any
more about what I said?

868
01:10:58,418 --> 01:10:59,875
Well I haven't had time really.

869
01:10:59,876 --> 01:11:02,168
What's there to think about so long?

870
01:11:03,334 --> 01:11:05,917
I mean, you enjoy it here, don't you?

871
01:11:05,918 --> 01:11:06,751
Yeah.

872
01:11:06,752 --> 01:11:08,333
Yeah, course you do.

873
01:11:08,334 --> 01:11:11,125
I mean you've got the run of the place.

874
01:11:11,126 --> 01:11:13,000
You've been getting a full pound 10 a week

875
01:11:13,001 --> 01:11:14,333
and your keep.

876
01:11:14,334 --> 01:11:16,500
I mean, that's a lot for a girl.

877
01:11:16,501 --> 01:11:18,500
I mean that's too much really

878
01:11:18,501 --> 01:11:20,293
and we could both all better live on that.

879
01:11:23,459 --> 01:11:25,458
Of course you get a bit more
when you're married, now.

880
01:11:25,459 --> 01:11:27,625
Yeah you get a bit more, Dulce.

881
01:11:27,626 --> 01:11:28,626
Yeah.

882
01:11:29,418 --> 01:11:30,418
I'd been fly now.

883
01:11:31,334 --> 01:11:32,751
Yeah, I been fly.

884
01:11:34,001 --> 01:11:36,209
I got quite a bit.

885
01:11:39,209 --> 01:11:42,458
You think about that, Dulce, eh?

886
01:11:42,459 --> 01:11:44,167
I am thinking about it.

887
01:11:44,168 --> 01:11:45,168
Ah.

888
01:11:48,168 --> 01:11:49,500
Well I'll give you something
to hurry up your mind.

889
01:11:49,501 --> 01:11:51,084
You come along with me.

890
01:12:01,459 --> 01:12:03,209
Sit down there, sit down there.

891
01:12:08,918 --> 01:12:11,583
Look at that, Dulce, look at it.

892
01:12:11,584 --> 01:12:14,125
There's money for you ain't it, eh?

893
01:12:14,126 --> 01:12:15,543
Ain't you surprised?

894
01:12:18,418 --> 01:12:19,251
Look at it!

895
01:12:19,252 --> 01:12:20,458
You don't want more than that, do you?

896
01:12:20,459 --> 01:12:21,583
I don't want it.

897
01:12:21,584 --> 01:12:22,875
See how fly I be?

898
01:12:22,876 --> 01:12:24,500
More than I know what to do with.

899
01:12:24,501 --> 01:12:25,917
I wanna wait a bit.

900
01:12:25,918 --> 01:12:27,208
All right, all right, all right.

901
01:12:27,209 --> 01:12:29,708
You wait.

902
01:12:29,709 --> 01:12:32,333
Here, here, take a pound
or two for yourself.

903
01:12:32,334 --> 01:12:34,376
Buy something just for yourself hmm?

904
01:12:35,668 --> 01:12:39,708
Dulce, how long do you wanna wait?

905
01:12:39,709 --> 01:12:41,583
I don't know, Mr. Parker.

906
01:12:41,584 --> 01:12:42,918
I just wanna wait a bit.

907
01:13:13,084 --> 01:13:14,750
45.

908
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:16,251
Okay how about 40?

909
01:13:17,251 --> 01:13:18,084
35 then.

910
01:13:18,085 --> 01:13:20,000
Thank you sir, 35, and 35.

911
01:13:20,001 --> 01:13:21,251
And 35, and 36.

912
01:13:22,126 --> 01:13:23,375
And 36, now 37.

913
01:13:23,376 --> 01:13:24,875
37, now 38.

914
01:13:24,876 --> 01:13:26,042
38, thank you sir.

915
01:13:26,043 --> 01:13:28,000
38, 39, thank you sir.

916
01:13:28,001 --> 01:13:31,208
Waiting, 40, 40, thank you sir, 40.

917
01:13:31,209 --> 01:13:33,209
What you got on today?

918
01:13:34,334 --> 01:13:35,583
What?

919
01:13:35,584 --> 01:13:37,293
Are you buying or selling today?

920
01:13:39,168 --> 01:13:40,792
I don't know, William.

921
01:13:40,793 --> 01:13:41,876
I don't know.

922
01:14:23,584 --> 01:14:24,751
Hello, Dulcima.

923
01:14:25,959 --> 01:14:27,375
You look nice today.

924
01:14:27,376 --> 01:14:28,833
It's my day off.

925
01:14:28,834 --> 01:14:30,458
You've never seen me on my day off.

926
01:14:30,459 --> 01:14:32,333
I wish it were my day off.

927
01:14:32,334 --> 01:14:33,458
You busy, then?

928
01:14:33,459 --> 01:14:34,376
No, not really.

929
01:14:34,377 --> 01:14:36,167
Oh I was just going down the hill.

930
01:14:36,168 --> 01:14:37,793
Well I'll walk with you if you like.

931
01:14:46,293 --> 01:14:48,625
Hey, look at my shoes,
they're all dirty.

932
01:14:48,626 --> 01:14:50,083
Here, I'll clean it for you.

933
01:14:50,084 --> 01:14:51,250
Oh, that's all right.

934
01:14:51,251 --> 01:14:53,583
We'll do it when we get off the road.

935
01:14:53,584 --> 01:14:55,375
Why don't we walk by the stream?

936
01:14:55,376 --> 01:14:57,125
There's a path through there.

937
01:14:57,126 --> 01:14:58,500
It's very pretty.

938
01:14:58,501 --> 01:14:59,834
It leads to the main road.

939
01:15:00,751 --> 01:15:01,584
All right.

940
01:15:01,584 --> 01:15:02,584
Mhmm.

941
01:15:06,126 --> 01:15:07,126
Oh.

942
01:16:03,709 --> 01:16:04,709
Dulcie!

943
01:16:06,084 --> 01:16:07,084
Dulcima!

944
01:16:20,959 --> 01:16:21,959
Dulce!

945
01:16:23,251 --> 01:16:24,251
Dulce!

946
01:16:38,251 --> 01:16:39,251
Thank you.

947
01:17:43,543 --> 01:17:46,417
Mr. Parker, I thought you were at market.

948
01:17:46,418 --> 01:17:47,418
I came back.

949
01:17:48,543 --> 01:17:50,500
Where you been, eh?

950
01:17:50,501 --> 01:17:51,750
Where'd you get them things?

951
01:17:51,751 --> 01:17:52,751
I bought them.

952
01:17:53,459 --> 01:17:55,917
Well you gave me the
money, you gave it me.

953
01:17:55,918 --> 01:17:57,042
Ah that's right, yeah.

954
01:17:57,043 --> 01:17:58,750
Yeah I did, didn't I?

955
01:17:58,751 --> 01:17:59,751
Course.

956
01:18:01,001 --> 01:18:02,292
You look good.

957
01:18:02,293 --> 01:18:04,209
Hey, you look so good, Dulce.

958
01:18:05,793 --> 01:18:07,417
Been out by yourself?

959
01:18:07,418 --> 01:18:08,584
By myself?

960
01:18:09,834 --> 01:18:11,417
Course.

961
01:18:11,418 --> 01:18:13,418
Who else is there for me to go out with?

962
01:18:15,126 --> 01:18:16,167
Do you want a bite to eat?

963
01:18:16,168 --> 01:18:17,917
No, no, no, I ain't hungry.

964
01:18:17,918 --> 01:18:18,918
Oh I am.

965
01:18:18,919 --> 01:18:20,875
Walking up and down that hill.

966
01:18:20,876 --> 01:18:22,375
I better go and take these things off.

967
01:18:22,376 --> 01:18:23,251
I got some work to do.

968
01:18:23,252 --> 01:18:25,250
No, no, don't take them off, no.

969
01:18:25,251 --> 01:18:26,500
Keep them on, they're nice.

970
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:27,958
But I got work to do.

971
01:18:27,959 --> 01:18:29,708
I ain't working in these.

972
01:18:29,709 --> 01:18:31,750
Well don't do it now, leave it.

973
01:18:31,751 --> 01:18:32,668
I tell you what.

974
01:18:32,669 --> 01:18:34,833
I'll get dressed up and
we'll go out tonight, eh?

975
01:18:34,834 --> 01:18:35,917
Have a meal out.

976
01:18:35,918 --> 01:18:38,083
Oh not tonight, Mr. Parker.

977
01:18:38,084 --> 01:18:39,043
Why not?

978
01:18:39,044 --> 01:18:40,708
Well I got to go down to me Ma's.

979
01:18:40,709 --> 01:18:41,792
Your Ma's?

980
01:18:41,793 --> 01:18:44,125
Well I ain't seen them
since I been working up here.

981
01:18:44,126 --> 01:18:45,500
Oh.

982
01:18:45,501 --> 01:18:47,250
Well I can come to, can't I?

983
01:18:47,251 --> 01:18:48,792
Oh no.

984
01:18:48,793 --> 01:18:50,792
I mean I wanna see me sisters.

985
01:18:50,793 --> 01:18:52,501
Show off me new things.

986
01:18:53,751 --> 01:18:55,543
I'll only be gone a couple of hours.

987
01:20:13,709 --> 01:20:15,917
That dress in the
window, how much is it?

988
01:20:15,918 --> 01:20:16,751
Which one?

989
01:20:16,751 --> 01:20:17,751
The white one.

990
01:20:18,626 --> 01:20:20,417
18 pounds.

991
01:20:20,418 --> 01:20:22,250
18 pound?

992
01:20:22,251 --> 01:20:24,583
I ain't trying to buy the bloody shop.

993
01:20:24,584 --> 01:20:26,708
It's a special design.

994
01:20:26,709 --> 01:20:28,167
Ah.

995
01:20:28,168 --> 01:20:29,208
Ah well get it out.

996
01:20:29,209 --> 01:20:31,167
I wanna have a look at it.

997
01:20:31,168 --> 01:20:32,001
Can you come back in the morning?

998
01:20:32,002 --> 01:20:33,333
We're closing now.

999
01:20:33,334 --> 01:20:35,043
No I can't, I gotta have it now.

1000
01:20:35,959 --> 01:20:37,084
Oh all right.

1001
01:20:44,876 --> 01:20:47,542
Ah, that's lovely.

1002
01:20:47,543 --> 01:20:49,083
Yeah it is.

1003
01:20:49,084 --> 01:20:50,792
That's really lovely.

1004
01:20:50,793 --> 01:20:53,125
She'll look lovely in that, huh?

1005
01:20:53,126 --> 01:20:54,126
Yeah.

1006
01:20:55,043 --> 01:20:57,750
Any girl would wanna get married in that.

1007
01:20:57,751 --> 01:20:58,751
Wouldn't they?

1008
01:21:40,126 --> 01:21:43,500
Not
yet, just a few months.

1009
01:21:43,501 --> 01:21:45,958
You ask, sweet Susan.

1010
01:21:45,959 --> 01:21:48,042
Getting to know you has been wonderful.

1011
01:21:48,043 --> 01:21:50,708
Oh darling,
please don't go without me.

1012
01:21:50,709 --> 01:21:52,376
Take me with you please.

1013
01:21:56,459 --> 01:21:58,333
I won't be long, Mr. Parker.

1014
01:21:58,334 --> 01:21:59,542
Just a minute, Dulce.

1015
01:21:59,543 --> 01:22:00,959
I got something to show you.

1016
01:22:04,084 --> 01:22:05,333
Oh.

1017
01:22:05,334 --> 01:22:07,292
You bought a new suit.

1018
01:22:07,293 --> 01:22:08,542
I like it.

1019
01:22:08,543 --> 01:22:10,792
And you got some new shoes.

1020
01:22:10,793 --> 01:22:12,293
Oh you do look smart.

1021
01:22:13,209 --> 01:22:14,708
Hey Dulce, you ain't gonna

1022
01:22:14,709 --> 01:22:16,375
walk down there, are you?

1023
01:22:16,376 --> 01:22:17,209
Yes.

1024
01:22:17,210 --> 01:22:18,792
Well you can't do that.

1025
01:22:18,793 --> 01:22:20,500
It'll be dark before long.

1026
01:22:20,501 --> 01:22:22,208
You'll fall in them potholes.

1027
01:22:22,209 --> 01:22:24,125
No I won't, I'll be careful.

1028
01:22:24,126 --> 01:22:25,333
Well
I'll run you down there.

1029
01:22:25,334 --> 01:22:27,083
Oh no, don't do that.

1030
01:22:27,084 --> 01:22:28,542
No, I'll be all right.

1031
01:22:28,543 --> 01:22:30,500
You stay and watch the television.

1032
01:22:30,501 --> 01:22:33,209
And don't wait up for
me if you don't want to.

1033
01:26:14,334 --> 01:26:16,000
Hello, Mr. Parker.

1034
01:26:16,001 --> 01:26:17,583
You're still up.

1035
01:26:17,584 --> 01:26:18,584
Yeah.

1036
01:26:20,668 --> 01:26:22,042
How's your Ma?

1037
01:26:22,043 --> 01:26:23,084
Oh, well enough.

1038
01:26:24,376 --> 01:26:26,125
She was pleased to see me.

1039
01:26:26,126 --> 01:26:27,126
Yeah?

1040
01:26:28,209 --> 01:26:30,459
What she think of your new things?

1041
01:26:31,293 --> 01:26:33,000
She thought I looked grand.

1042
01:26:33,001 --> 01:26:34,250
Grand?

1043
01:26:34,251 --> 01:26:35,709
She thought I looked nice.

1044
01:26:37,209 --> 01:26:38,833
Well I better go upstairs.

1045
01:26:38,834 --> 01:26:40,000
My dress has got creased

1046
01:26:40,001 --> 01:26:41,542
and I wanna hang it up.

1047
01:26:41,543 --> 01:26:43,667
Just a minute.

1048
01:26:43,668 --> 01:26:44,834
Just a minute.

1049
01:26:47,751 --> 01:26:50,834
I ain't had a good look at
you myself yet, have I, hmm?

1050
01:26:52,418 --> 01:26:54,542
I mean after all, I,

1051
01:26:54,543 --> 01:26:56,334
I got a right to, haven't I eh?

1052
01:26:57,876 --> 01:26:59,918
Why, new gloves.

1053
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:04,293
New underwear.

1054
01:27:07,584 --> 01:27:08,793
New shoes.

1055
01:27:10,376 --> 01:27:12,917
New dress, huh.

1056
01:27:12,918 --> 01:27:17,043
After all, you did get
them for me didn't you?

1057
01:27:19,126 --> 01:27:20,917
Well didn't you?

1058
01:27:20,918 --> 01:27:22,333
No!

1059
01:27:22,334 --> 01:27:23,334
No?

1060
01:27:24,168 --> 01:27:25,583
No?

1061
01:27:25,584 --> 01:27:28,084
Oh, I see.

1062
01:27:29,001 --> 01:27:30,084
Ah, well then.

1063
01:27:32,084 --> 01:27:34,251
Well who the hell did
you get them for, eh?

1064
01:27:35,084 --> 01:27:36,458
Nobody.

1065
01:27:36,459 --> 01:27:37,459
Nobody?

1066
01:27:39,334 --> 01:27:41,500
No, you must have got yourself

1067
01:27:41,501 --> 01:27:44,001
dressed up for somebody, huh?

1068
01:27:46,459 --> 01:27:47,500
Who was it?

1069
01:27:48,334 --> 01:27:49,334
Who was it!?

1070
01:27:50,668 --> 01:27:52,250
It's Albert, isn't it?

1071
01:27:52,251 --> 01:27:53,251
It's Albert!

1072
01:27:53,252 --> 01:27:55,250
There ain't no Albert,
that's somebody I made up!

1073
01:27:55,251 --> 01:27:56,542
- There never was no Albert!
- No, there wasn't

1074
01:27:56,543 --> 01:27:57,875
no Albert, wasn't they?

1075
01:27:57,876 --> 01:27:59,500
There ain't no Albert, I made it up!

1076
01:27:59,501 --> 01:28:00,792
I'd seen you!

1077
01:28:00,793 --> 01:28:02,583
I'd seen you, I'd seen you down there!

1078
01:28:02,584 --> 01:28:03,958
I'd seen you plain as daylight!

1079
01:28:03,959 --> 01:28:05,750
You never think I did see you, did you,

1080
01:28:05,751 --> 01:28:10,751
you bitch!

1081
01:28:16,168 --> 01:28:17,292
Open this door, you bitch,

1082
01:28:17,293 --> 01:28:18,833
I'll take a bloody stick to you!

1083
01:28:18,834 --> 01:28:20,917
Never was an Albert, eh?

1084
01:28:20,918 --> 01:28:23,375
You lying bitch!

1085
01:28:23,376 --> 01:28:24,792
There ain't no Albert.

1086
01:28:24,793 --> 01:28:26,417
There never was no Albert.

1087
01:28:26,418 --> 01:28:27,792
That's somebody I made up.

1088
01:28:27,793 --> 01:28:28,751
No?

1089
01:28:28,752 --> 01:28:31,375
Well who the hell have you been with?

1090
01:28:31,376 --> 01:28:33,000
With, with,

1091
01:28:33,001 --> 01:28:35,459
With Albert, that's who,
with Albert!

1092
01:28:36,459 --> 01:28:37,875
Yeah, I've seen him.

1093
01:28:37,876 --> 01:28:39,250
I've seen him this morning!

1094
01:28:39,251 --> 01:28:40,875
I've seen him tonight!

1095
01:28:40,876 --> 01:28:43,875
I see him all the bloody time!

1096
01:28:43,876 --> 01:28:47,167
That's who you got yourself
codded up for, wasn't it?!

1097
01:28:47,168 --> 01:28:49,668
It was Albert, Albert, Albert!

1098
01:28:54,126 --> 01:28:57,125
You ain't got nothing
to say now, are you, eh?

1099
01:28:57,126 --> 01:28:59,417
Oh don't go on so, Mr. Parker, please.

1100
01:28:59,418 --> 01:29:02,208
I was gonna tell you, honest I was.

1101
01:29:02,209 --> 01:29:03,209
Tell me what?

1102
01:29:05,126 --> 01:29:06,583
I'm leaving in the morning.

1103
01:29:06,584 --> 01:29:07,708
Leaving?!

1104
01:29:07,709 --> 01:29:08,917
Yes.

1105
01:29:08,918 --> 01:29:11,750
My young man's coming to
fetch me in the morning.

1106
01:29:11,751 --> 01:29:13,958
You're
not leaving this house!

1107
01:29:13,959 --> 01:29:15,958
I'm going home.

1108
01:29:15,959 --> 01:29:16,959
Home?

1109
01:29:18,543 --> 01:29:19,750
For how long?

1110
01:29:19,751 --> 01:29:21,250
For good.

1111
01:29:21,251 --> 01:29:22,251
Forever!

1112
01:29:24,168 --> 01:29:26,084
Oh, you bitch.

1113
01:29:27,043 --> 01:29:28,043
You bitch.

1114
01:29:29,376 --> 01:29:31,875
I bet you've both had a bloody good laugh

1115
01:29:31,876 --> 01:29:33,251
over me, eh, eh?

1116
01:29:34,293 --> 01:29:37,543
I bet you both had a bloody good laugh!

1117
01:31:26,459 --> 01:31:27,459
Dulce?

1118
01:31:30,126 --> 01:31:31,126
Dulce?

1119
01:31:33,293 --> 01:31:34,793
I'm sorry for what I said.

1120
01:31:36,209 --> 01:31:37,209
I'm sorry.

1121
01:31:40,709 --> 01:31:41,834
Don't go, Dulce.

1122
01:31:43,209 --> 01:31:44,209
Don't go.

1123
01:31:47,126 --> 01:31:49,126
I don't know what I'd do if you left me.

1124
01:31:51,001 --> 01:31:52,001
I can't.

1125
01:31:53,251 --> 01:31:55,667
I can't bear to think of
you with anybody else.

1126
01:31:55,668 --> 01:31:56,668
I can't bear it.

1127
01:31:59,126 --> 01:32:00,126
Dulce?

1128
01:32:01,168 --> 01:32:02,543
Dulce, let me in please.

1129
01:32:05,293 --> 01:32:08,708
I wouldn't hurt you, you know that.

1130
01:32:08,709 --> 01:32:09,709
Dulce?

1131
01:32:11,668 --> 01:32:12,668
Dulce?

1132
01:32:14,793 --> 01:32:19,167
I love you, Dulce.

1133
01:32:19,168 --> 01:32:20,168
I love you.

1134
01:34:32,626 --> 01:34:34,543
Mr. Parker?

1135
01:36:58,209 --> 01:36:59,375
Hello, Dulcima.

1136
01:36:59,376 --> 01:37:00,376
Hello.

1137
01:37:01,209 --> 01:37:02,209
Am I too early?

1138
01:37:03,584 --> 01:37:04,584
No.

1139
01:37:06,168 --> 01:37:07,418
I can't come now.

1140
01:37:09,584 --> 01:37:11,543
You see, it's Mr. Parker.

1141
01:37:12,751 --> 01:37:14,626
He's very upset about me leaving.

1142
01:37:19,918 --> 01:37:22,792
I don't know where he is.

1143
01:37:22,793 --> 01:37:24,334
And I just can't go.

1144
01:37:28,293 --> 01:37:29,293
I just can't go.

1145
01:37:34,126 --> 01:37:35,126
Ah, well.

1146
01:37:35,918 --> 01:37:37,376
I just can't go.

1147
01:37:39,959 --> 01:37:40,959
You better stay then.

1148
01:37:46,334 --> 01:37:47,334
Albert!

1149
01:37:48,418 --> 01:37:49,625
Albert!
